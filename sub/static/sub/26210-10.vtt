Divas...

00:06.266 --> 00:08.180
This is what
Nia's been waiting for.

00:08.180 --> 00:10.296
I'm gonna kill it, and
everybody is gonna watch me do

00:10.296 --> 00:13.391
it with style.

00:13.391 --> 00:15.491
Nia Jax has done
it!

00:16.958 --> 00:19.391
One of my biggest
fears is getting a divorce.

00:19.391 --> 00:22.191
There's just no time for me and
him anymore.

00:22.191 --> 00:26.125
I'm getting an apartment with or
without your consent.

00:26.125 --> 00:28.591
Lana did it!
Lana just qualified for

00:28.591 --> 00:30.258
Money in the Bank!

00:30.258 --> 00:33.158
This opportunity is
career‐changing for me.

00:33.158 --> 00:36.491
Get it in there.
Boom, boom, boom.

00:36.491 --> 00:39.258
Tonight on the season
finale of <i>Total Divas...</i>

00:40.258 --> 00:41.258
Yes!

00:41.258 --> 00:43.791
This is a very
high‐stakes match.

00:43.791 --> 00:47.791
Nia Jax against
Ronda Rousey.

00:48.791 --> 00:50.791
No!
My wedding ring was taken.

Bank pay‐per‐view looming this

01:31.965 --> 01:34.731
Sunday.
The winners will earn guaranteed

01:34.731 --> 01:36.398

01:36.398 --> 01:39.765
Next week is Money in
the Bank, and this is such an

01:39.765 --> 01:43.998
important event for the women of
WWE because we are getting the

01:43.998 --> 01:47.065
chance to compete in a very
historic women's ladder match.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.765
Competing in a ladder match is
no easy task.

02:20.205 --> 02:23.505
This Sunday, Nia
Jax defends her Raw Women's

02:23.505 --> 02:26.338
Championship against Ronda
Rousey.

02:26.338 --> 02:29.471
Next week, Ronda and I
will be facing off at Money in

02:29.471 --> 02:32.505
the Bank in Chicago.
Ronda Rousey is considered the

02:32.505 --> 02:36.038
baddest woman on the planet, and
the fact that they're tasking me

02:36.038 --> 02:40.138
with being Ronda's first singles
match at Money in the Bank is

02:40.138 --> 02:44.805
quite an honor, and I'm really,
really, really grateful for it.

02:46.871 --> 02:52.705
She's still very new in the WWE.
You're just not ready.

02:52.705 --> 02:57.271
I am Ronda Rousey, and
I was born ready!

02:58.271 --> 03:01.078
I have goose bumps.
These girls are doing great.

03:03.078 --> 03:04.445
Uh‐oh.

03:04.445 --> 03:05.445
Oh, head butt!

03:05.445 --> 03:06.445
Oh,.

03:06.445 --> 03:07.445
Damn.

03:07.445 --> 03:09.278
Trying to power
out here.

03:09.278 --> 03:10.111
What is this?

03:10.111 --> 03:11.978
There's the
power of the champion.

03:11.978 --> 03:13.978
And Ronda, though, wrestling her
back.

03:13.978 --> 03:14.978
Ronda...

03:14.978 --> 03:16.978
Tapping out.
Nia's tapping.

03:16.978 --> 03:20.611
Nia just tapped to Rousey.
If that happens Sunday, Rousey

03:20.611 --> 03:27.611
will shock the world and win the
RawWomen's Championship.

03:27.611 --> 03:29.878
You're trending
worldwide, and you frickin' did

03:29.878 --> 03:30.878
amazing.

03:30.878 --> 03:31.878
Thank you.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.411
Like, oh, my god, you
did so amazing.

03:34.411 --> 03:37.145
I'm stressing because
it's like I'm peaking.

03:37.145 --> 03:40.678
This is the peak.
Within ten minutes of me

03:40.678 --> 03:43.511
challenging Ronda Rousey, I
guess I've known that she's so,

03:43.511 --> 03:45.845
you know, mainstream, but I
didn't realize it until, you

03:45.845 --> 03:49.411
know, you have it picked up by
Forbes, and you have it picked

03:49.411 --> 03:52.778
up by <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>
You know, like, all these

03:52.778 --> 03:55.478
different news outlets that are
pretty mainstream.

03:55.478 --> 03:59.045
And it's a better pay‐per‐view,
but it's taken it and made it

03:59.045 --> 04:01.351
like a <i>WrestleMania.</i>
Like, it's a huge show.

04:01.351 --> 04:05.185
It's a huge match for me, and
I'm getting a little nervous.

04:05.185 --> 04:07.185
Go in there, kill it,
show them your worth and show

04:07.185 --> 04:09.185
them that... this isn't your
peak.

04:09.185 --> 04:12.018
You know what?
We've got this. Three words.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.018
Sister!

04:13.018 --> 04:14.018
You got this!

04:14.018 --> 04:15.018
Love it.

04:15.018 --> 04:16.017
We got this.

04:16.017 --> 04:16.985
Oh, yeah.

04:16.985 --> 04:18.651
And now we need to
get a glass of wine.

04:18.651 --> 04:22.151
Now I need some wine,
because I need the stress relief.

04:29.818 --> 04:31.651
That's pretty.

04:31.651 --> 04:32.651
Yup.

04:32.651 --> 04:35.084
What's the name of
this style of diamond, like the,

04:35.084 --> 04:36.251
em... em...?

04:36.251 --> 04:38.351
Princess cut.

04:38.351 --> 04:40.485
Which one did you have,
Trinity?

04:40.485 --> 04:42.918
You had the eternity band,
princess cut?

04:42.918 --> 04:45.251
I had the eternity
band, um...

04:45.251 --> 04:46.251
Mm‐hmm, yup, I remember.

04:46.251 --> 04:48.585
The Atlanta
apartment situation caused so

04:48.585 --> 04:51.685
much ongoing conflict with Jon
and I.

04:51.685 --> 04:54.685
I just want us to have a little
getaway place...

04:54.685 --> 04:57.351
A getaway place for you.
What am I gonna go to Atlanta

04:57.351 --> 04:58.351
for?

04:58.351 --> 05:01.858
For me, for us.
On top of everything Jon and I

05:01.858 --> 05:04.758
have been going through, last
week, the car was broken into.

05:04.758 --> 05:09.791
Oh, heck no.
Oh, my freakin' backpack is gone.

05:09.791 --> 05:13.925
My backpack was stolen, and
then, I realized my wedding ring

05:13.925 --> 05:16.025
was in the bag.
This is the icing on the cake.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.025
I just want to get a new ring on
my finger ASAP.

05:18.025 --> 05:20.025
I feel like that'll solve some
of the issues.

05:20.025 --> 05:22.025
You gonna get a ring,
as well?

05:22.025 --> 05:23.025
Me?

05:23.025 --> 05:24.025
Yeah?

05:24.025 --> 05:25.858
Oh, no, thank you.
I have my ring.

05:25.858 --> 05:26.858
That's good.

05:26.858 --> 05:28.458
Because I make sure I
wear mine all the time.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.291
You're a good guy.

05:29.291 --> 05:30.958
You know, I would just
lose it if it's off my finger.

05:30.958 --> 05:33.291
Not everybody wears.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.791
You like this one
or no?

05:34.791 --> 05:37.858
It's not about the...
the‐the ring, Trinity.

05:37.858 --> 05:41.825
Well, what do you
mean, it's not about the ring?

05:41.825 --> 05:48.058
Okay, let me discuss it a little
more with my... my husband here,

05:48.058 --> 05:49.058
and I'll let you know.

05:49.058 --> 05:50.058
Okay, no problem.

05:51.058 --> 05:54.591
What do you mean,
it's not about the ring?

06:02.665 --> 06:07.331
Hello.
Can I come in? Hey, Muffy.

06:07.331 --> 06:10.231
My sister Muffy is in town, and
we're just spending some nice,

06:10.231 --> 06:13.565
quality time together.
Daddy, look what I brought.

06:13.565 --> 06:14.565
Mmm, yummy.

06:14.565 --> 06:16.565
First of all, it is
good to see you.

06:16.565 --> 06:17.565
The house smells good.

06:17.565 --> 06:18.565
Oh, thanks.

06:18.565 --> 06:20.565
Smells a little like
kitty litter, but...

06:20.565 --> 06:21.398
Come here.

06:21.398 --> 06:23.065
Oh, dear, I don't
think you should be critical of

06:23.065 --> 06:24.065
me like that.

06:24.065 --> 06:25.998
Daddy‐‐ the first
thing I do when I see Daddy is,

06:25.998 --> 06:27.665
I want him to adjust me.

06:27.665 --> 06:29.498
'Cause these are
normal behaviors.

06:29.498 --> 06:30.498
Ready?

06:30.498 --> 06:32.331
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, father‐daughter bonding.

06:32.331 --> 06:34.998
Yeah, give me a
little traction.

06:35.665 --> 06:38.831
Oh, my lip gloss is
coming off. Okay.

06:41.098 --> 06:43.631
Well, I think I'm really tight.
Why don't we have some green

06:43.631 --> 06:45.831
tea, and Muffy, you and I can
have some girl time?

06:45.831 --> 06:50.998
Daddy's been, uh...
Maybe the last, uh, year or so,

06:50.998 --> 06:52.898
like, he just keeps on
reordering the same things.

06:52.898 --> 06:53.898
Like, he always keeps, uh...

06:53.898 --> 06:55.731
Buying the same
stuff?

06:55.731 --> 06:59.171
Yeah. Yeah.
What he's been doing, which is

06:59.171 --> 07:02.405
really crazy, is just, he keeps
buying shoes, runners.

07:02.405 --> 07:04.405
He keeps buying...
And they're all the same shoes.

07:04.405 --> 07:06.405
The thing is that
Daddy doesn't even probably

07:06.405 --> 07:07.405
remember.

07:07.405 --> 07:09.338
No, he doesn't.
That's the whole thing.

07:09.338 --> 07:12.171
My dad has
Alzheimer's, and a lot of people

07:12.171 --> 07:14.571
don't know that.
It's not something my mom or my

07:14.571 --> 07:17.938
sisters and I really have shared
publicly, because we wanted to

07:17.938 --> 07:20.905
protect my dad, and we didn't
want my dad to feel embarrassed.

07:20.905 --> 07:23.605
But it is becoming more evident
that there's something going on

07:23.605 --> 07:25.505
with my dad.
Okay, so you're basically saying

07:25.505 --> 07:27.371
he's racked up a crazy credit
card debt, and...

07:27.371 --> 07:28.871
I finally had to,
um...

07:28.871 --> 07:30.838
So how much does he
owe that he doesn't even know

07:30.838 --> 07:31.838
about?

07:31.838 --> 07:33.505
Well, it was...
Not that it was that much, but,

07:33.505 --> 07:35.771
you know, a few thousand dollars.

07:35.771 --> 07:39.371
I don't want people
to think that Daddy's not all

07:39.371 --> 07:41.505
there.
But then the other part of me is

07:41.505 --> 07:43.805
like, why are we hiding
something that this is really,

07:43.805 --> 07:44.805
really going on in our lives?

07:44.805 --> 07:48.371
Well, I can
tell you, Nat, it's, you know,

07:48.371 --> 07:51.238
something that's gonna progress.
He's never gonna be better.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.038
Every day, some days, he's
better than other times, but...

07:54.038 --> 07:55.838
Well, also, now,
you're gonna be, like, a

07:55.838 --> 07:56.838
caretaker for Daddy.

07:56.838 --> 07:57.838
Yes...

07:57.838 --> 07:59.445
He's gonna eventually
be in a home.

07:59.445 --> 08:01.411
I never want him to
know, because I don't want him

08:01.411 --> 08:03.478
to ever be afraid of what he's
gonna go through.

08:03.478 --> 08:06.445
My dad is one of the
strongest men that I know.

08:06.445 --> 08:09.011
When he was in high school, he
was a world‐class shot putter.

08:09.011 --> 08:13.545
He played football in the NFL.
And he ended up meeting my mom

08:13.545 --> 08:16.778
and getting into wrestling.
But with this condition, it has

08:16.778 --> 08:21.111
caused him to really struggle a
lot, and my mom has to pick up a

08:21.111 --> 08:24.645
lot of those pieces for my dad.
And I think it's hard on my mom

08:24.645 --> 08:29.378
watching my dad struggle, and
not really know what to do for

08:29.378 --> 08:32.245
him, except for just to be there
for him and help him through it.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.010
God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to start crying

08:34.010 --> 08:35.010
like that.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.778
No, it's good to...
I know we need to kind of purge

08:36.778 --> 08:37.611
ourselves of the...

08:37.611 --> 08:39.278
It's important
sometimes.

08:39.278 --> 08:40.611
It is.

08:40.611 --> 08:42.544
You know what it is,
too, is that I'm such a fixer,

08:42.544 --> 08:43.211
like...

08:43.211 --> 08:45.011
So let's start
learning more, let's get...

08:45.011 --> 08:47.011
Let's be proactive.
Let's, you know, don't be...

08:47.011 --> 08:49.445
Like you said, don't be...
Let's not be afraid of it.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.445
Let's just be...
Let's just get in there.

08:51.445 --> 08:53.745
Yeah.

08:53.745 --> 08:55.745
Tonight, Daniel
Bryan...

08:55.745 --> 08:57.745
Come on, Daddy.
Come on, Daddy.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.118
What do you think?

08:59.118 --> 09:02.118
Her eyes are glued.

09:02.118 --> 09:03.818
Yes! Yes! Yes!

09:03.818 --> 09:06.451
That's how I feel like
you just don't care.

09:06.451 --> 09:09.351
Don't worry about me, 'cause
when we get home... got my

09:09.351 --> 09:12.118
papers on the counter, waiting
for your ass to sign and dot.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.051
Divorce papers?

09:14.051 --> 09:17.118
I'm feeling tons of
anxiety about Money in the Bank,

09:17.118 --> 09:21.870
but I am the future of the Hart
family, and I'm going to make

09:21.870 --> 09:24.206
everybody proud.
Daddy, just tell me that

09:24.206 --> 09:25.358
everything's gonna be okay.

09:25.358 --> 09:26.625

Sweetface!

09:37.475 --> 09:38.475
Baby.

09:38.475 --> 09:41.308
Hey, Bryan.
Aw, he's reconnecting.

09:41.308 --> 09:42.442
Aw.

09:42.442 --> 09:45.575
Bryan is back on the
road, and he is gearing up for

09:45.575 --> 09:49.175
Money in the Bank, which
means... that he's never home.

09:49.175 --> 09:51.908
But I can't tell him how much I
miss him, because I think it

09:51.908 --> 09:54.342
would make him really sad.
But it's, like, bittersweet.

09:54.342 --> 09:57.108
It's, like, "Oh, I'm so happy
for you, but at the same time

09:57.108 --> 10:00.848
I'm really sad; you're gone."
Sweetface, Nicole and I have a

10:00.848 --> 10:04.315
"Bella Brains" question for you.
What year did Albert Einstein

10:04.315 --> 10:05.348
die?

10:05.348 --> 10:08.048
I mean, that's not
even a cultural question.

10:08.048 --> 10:09.315
Yes, it is.

10:09.315 --> 10:10.382
No, it's not.

10:10.382 --> 10:13.148
Ah, he doesn't know.
Okay, just give a guess.

10:13.148 --> 10:15.548
1958.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.048
Wow.

10:16.048 --> 10:17.715
Oh. That was really
close.

10:17.715 --> 10:19.215
That was really close.

10:20.215 --> 10:22.948
Nicole and I thought he
died in the 1800s.

10:23.948 --> 10:26.348
He seemed like he was
a part of, like, Socrates, or at

10:26.348 --> 10:27.915
least, like, a part of Newton.

10:27.915 --> 10:29.082
Socrates?

10:29.082 --> 10:31.115
Like, I thought he was
around the time with the

10:31.115 --> 10:33.382
light bulb.
I mean, when you think of the

10:33.382 --> 10:36.882
photos, they seem fairly recent,
but, like, I still, like,

10:36.882 --> 10:37.915
thought...

10:37.915 --> 10:41.548
You should just know,
because he has photos.

10:41.548 --> 10:42.548
Oh, that's...

10:42.548 --> 10:43.582
Oh, good point.

10:43.582 --> 10:44.582
Socrates?

10:44.582 --> 10:46.582
And that he stuck his
tongue out in photos‐‐ like,

10:46.582 --> 10:48.682
they wouldn't have done that
back then.

10:48.682 --> 10:52.915
That famous Einstein photo where
he's like, "Eh." Right?

10:52.915 --> 10:54.415
I feel like that's
photoshopped.

10:54.415 --> 10:57.782
The two of you.
I've got to, um, make the gym

10:57.782 --> 10:59.815
shuttle in 19 minutes, and I'm
not... I just did a

10:59.815 --> 11:02.088
meet‐and‐greet.
Okay, but I love you.

11:02.088 --> 11:04.055
I love you, too,
sweetface.

11:04.055 --> 11:05.055
Bye.

11:05.055 --> 11:07.322
I am, like, so
envious.

11:07.322 --> 11:10.322
Like, I would do anything to be
in a Money in the Bank match.

11:10.322 --> 11:14.955
I'm getting more, like, hunger,
and I just really want to have a

11:14.955 --> 11:18.088
comeback together as the Bella
Twins.

11:18.088 --> 11:20.555
By the way, we really, when we
say stuff, have to think about

11:20.555 --> 11:22.722
it.
Like, oh, yeah, there's photos

11:22.722 --> 11:26.955
of Albert Einstein, so maybe he
didn't die in the 1800s.

11:35.622 --> 11:37.722
We're gonna have a
real quick little workout,

11:37.722 --> 11:40.288
Daddy, and then you and I are
gonna go for a little dip, and

11:40.288 --> 11:42.855
we're gonna have lunch.
I'm home right now, and there's

11:42.855 --> 11:44.888
a few days before Money in the
Bank.

11:44.888 --> 11:47.622
Money in the Bank is such an
important event for us.

11:47.622 --> 11:51.688
We are getting the chance to
compete in a very historical

11:51.688 --> 11:54.988
women's ladder match, which
we've only ever had two before

11:54.988 --> 11:59.288
this in the WWE, so being a part
of this ladder match is gonna be

11:59.288 --> 12:02.662
amazing.

12:02.662 --> 12:03.828
Daddy, that's not what

12:03.828 --> 12:06.262
we're doing today.
My dad and I shared this dream

12:06.262 --> 12:10.228
together of being in the WWE.
Feel that. Is that too heavy?

12:10.228 --> 12:13.862
My dad and I both got to be
Superstars in the WWE.

12:13.862 --> 12:17.795
And I think that...
is just this bond that we're

12:17.795 --> 12:20.862
gonna have for the rest of our
lives. Now we're gonna do curls.

12:20.862 --> 12:26.695
Bring 'em up. Good, Daddy. Good.
Oh.

12:26.695 --> 12:30.295
It's also a way of continuing to
carry the torch that my

12:30.295 --> 12:33.628
grandfather passed on to his
kids and that my uncles and my

12:33.628 --> 12:37.328
father passed on to me.
I am the future of the Hart

12:37.328 --> 12:39.795
family. Ooh.

12:39.795 --> 12:40.795
That was good.

12:40.795 --> 12:44.195
Yeah. You did great.
I'm feeling tons of anxiety

12:44.195 --> 12:46.795
about Money in the Bank, but I'm
going to do this and I'm going

12:46.795 --> 12:51.928
to make everybody, including
myself, proud.

12:51.928 --> 12:57.762
Daddy, just tell me that
everything's gonna be okay.

12:57.762 --> 12:59.462
Throw your dropkicks.

12:59.462 --> 13:00.768
I'm not a dropkicker.

13:00.768 --> 13:01.902
Yeah, you are.

13:01.902 --> 13:03.002
I don't think so.

13:03.002 --> 13:05.602
Let me see if you
still have it.

13:05.602 --> 13:09.168
On my dad's side, Alzheimer's
does run in the family.

13:09.168 --> 13:12.002
It's hard watching family go
through something that they

13:12.002 --> 13:15.302
don't have any control of.
If I found out that I carried

13:15.302 --> 13:19.302
the gene, I think it would be
upsetting, but there's a lot of

13:19.302 --> 13:22.035
power in knowing.
And there is this test to find

13:22.035 --> 13:25.368
out if you carry a gene that
makes you more prone to having

13:25.368 --> 13:28.035
Alzheimer's.
So I'm really curious about

13:28.035 --> 13:32.035
taking this test.
Let's leave it at that.

13:39.668 --> 13:45.435
Honey, I don't get
what all the attitude was for.

13:45.435 --> 13:49.002
I went to go get a new ring,
because I need to replace the

13:49.002 --> 13:51.468
one that's missing and have
something on my finger.

13:51.468 --> 13:53.868
It's the principle
behind that damn ring.

13:53.868 --> 13:56.202
You don't wear it‐‐ that's
number one. Number two...

13:56.202 --> 13:58.202
I do wear it.
I just forget to put it on

13:58.202 --> 13:58.702
sometimes.

13:58.702 --> 14:02.075
I always told you to
wear it. You never wore it.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.808
I work just like you.
I have mine on.

14:04.808 --> 14:08.975
I wear mine on all the time.
There's no excuse.

14:08.975 --> 14:11.508
That's how I feel like you just
don't care.

14:11.508 --> 14:14.008
And that's, like, little things.
Little things like that to me,

14:14.008 --> 14:14.675
that's what...

14:14.675 --> 14:17.142
I do care, though.
I do care.

14:17.142 --> 14:19.875
That's why I got up today and
tried to go find something.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.408
It ain't just goin' up
in no jewelry store and just

14:22.408 --> 14:25.742
grabbing another ring to have on
your finger.

14:25.742 --> 14:29.308
You know the story of that ring.
Only me and you know the story

14:29.308 --> 14:31.775
of that ring.
That's the sentimental value it

14:31.775 --> 14:32.842
has to me.

14:32.842 --> 14:37.675
This does make me
feel terrible and just even

14:37.675 --> 14:41.808
more upset about the situation,
'cause it's just one disaster

14:41.808 --> 14:43.808
after another.
I know that ring is

14:43.808 --> 14:46.675
irreplaceable.
So what, just, I'm not gonna

14:46.675 --> 14:48.142
have anything on my finger now?

14:48.142 --> 14:51.708
It's been like
that.

14:51.708 --> 14:54.608
Just get through Money in the
Bank.

14:54.608 --> 14:57.908
Don't worry about me, 'cause
when we got home... got my

14:57.908 --> 15:00.882
papers on the counter, waiting
for your ass to sign and dot.

15:00.882 --> 15:08.482
Divorce papers?
That's not funny.

15:08.482 --> 15:12.015
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Wow! Wow!

15:12.015 --> 15:14.415
Honestly, I can't
believe what these girls are

15:14.415 --> 15:18.715
doing.

15:18.715 --> 15:22.482
So, are you ready to
see your results?

15:22.482 --> 15:24.815
If it's... something
that's gonna be bad, I just

15:24.815 --> 15:25.815
don't want to have it...

15:25.815 --> 15:26.815
Having it haunt you.

15:26.815 --> 15:28.407
Yeah.

15:39.098 --> 15:40.539
I don't know why I'm
so nervous.

15:40.539 --> 15:41.972
It'll be okay.

15:41.972 --> 15:43.206
I was like...

15:44.772 --> 15:46.539
I just...

15:46.539 --> 15:48.906
Wondering what you got
yourself into?

15:48.906 --> 15:52.339
Yeah. Pretty much.
So, yesterday, I got tested for

15:52.339 --> 15:54.906
the Alzheimer's gene.
I guess I just want to have

15:54.906 --> 15:55.906
peace of mind.

15:55.906 --> 15:57.906
I feel like it's gonna
be the opposite.

15:57.906 --> 16:00.212
That's why I don't want to know.
If you're meant to have

16:00.212 --> 16:02.212
Alzheimer's, then you're meant
to have Alzheimer's.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.846
Oh, don't be nervous.

16:03.846 --> 16:05.846
I know. I hate giving
blood.

16:05.846 --> 16:08.879
I am feeling sick to my stomach
about to get these results.

16:08.879 --> 16:11.179
I just feel like it's gonna be
this black cloud looming over me

16:11.179 --> 16:14.179
my entire life, and I would just
rather not have that.

16:14.179 --> 16:15.412
So, you have the results?

16:15.412 --> 16:17.412
I do.
I have the results.

16:17.412 --> 16:20.512
Okay.
'Cause I've been having anxiety

16:20.512 --> 16:23.279
attacks over the results.
I just don't want to... it's

16:23.279 --> 16:25.879
like knowing that, like, I don't
know, just knowing this

16:25.879 --> 16:27.179
information, and then...

16:27.179 --> 16:28.179
Having it haunt you.

16:28.179 --> 16:29.179
Yeah.

16:29.179 --> 16:34.946
So, are you ready to
see your results?

16:34.946 --> 16:40.646
I don't really know
if I want to see my results.

16:40.646 --> 16:43.379
I just don't... I don't know, I
just don't want to have it

16:43.379 --> 16:46.812
looming over me my entire life
if something... if it's

16:46.812 --> 16:50.546
something that's gonna be bad.
And I really don't want to think

16:50.546 --> 16:51.579
about it every single day.

16:51.579 --> 16:52.246
Mm‐hmm.

16:52.246 --> 16:53.246
You know what I mean?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.646
Yeah. If you're not
ready now, you could always find

16:55.646 --> 16:59.346
out later, but the sooner you
know, the more you can... do all

16:59.346 --> 17:03.986
the right things.

17:03.986 --> 17:05.986
What were your
findings?

17:05.986 --> 17:09.219
Um, I'm so used to
giving these results to people

17:09.219 --> 17:11.919
that I am not... never worried,
but in your case, for sure,

17:11.919 --> 17:14.352
it's, you know, something,
there's just no worries at all.

17:14.352 --> 17:15.352
Oh, thank God.

17:15.352 --> 17:19.652
So you have... you have
a, uh, you know, just a totally

17:19.652 --> 17:21.952
normal result.

17:21.952 --> 17:25.586
That's awesome!
That's such good news.

17:25.586 --> 17:29.852
There's two genes, and
you have the common variety that

17:29.852 --> 17:33.586
has no risk associated with it.
It's just middle of the road, no

17:33.586 --> 17:36.752
risk. And you have two genes like
that.

17:36.752 --> 17:38.119
It's a huge relief.

17:38.119 --> 17:40.252
Amazing relief.
Like winning the lottery today.

17:40.252 --> 17:42.319
Yeah.
Okay, so I'm never gonna get

17:42.319 --> 17:45.819
Alzheimer's but I have a family
member that has it, and as this

17:45.819 --> 17:48.786
disease progresses, you know, it
will continue to be more

17:48.786 --> 17:50.919
challenging for our family.
But we're just doing the best

17:50.919 --> 17:51.919
that we can.

17:51.919 --> 17:53.852
Are you gonna tell
Daddy?

17:53.852 --> 17:54.786
No.

17:54.786 --> 17:56.586
I don't think Daddy
really needs to know.

17:56.586 --> 17:58.586
My dad doesn't know at all that
he has Alzheimer's.

17:58.586 --> 17:59.619
Mm‐hmm.

17:59.619 --> 18:02.359
You know, there's
good days and there's bad days.

18:02.359 --> 18:06.126
So we just‐‐ one day at a time.
One day at a time for all of us.

18:10.259 --> 18:12.992
From Memphis,
Tennessee, we welcome you to

18:12.992 --> 18:14.892
SmackDown Live.

18:14.892 --> 18:16.959
Your pants are coming
down.

18:16.959 --> 18:18.926
With the Money in
the Bank pay‐per‐view this

18:18.926 --> 18:21.392
Sunday, our GM Paige has
scheduled a night of

18:21.392 --> 18:22.392
never‐before‐seen matchups.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.259
Here we go.

18:23.259 --> 18:25.059
Should I wear this
tonight?

18:25.059 --> 18:26.392
Yes, you should wear
this tonight.

18:26.392 --> 18:27.892
I have to be ready for
this ladder match.

18:27.892 --> 18:29.726
This is the biggest match of my
career.

18:29.726 --> 18:31.292
This is your
second‐biggest match of your

18:31.292 --> 18:33.659
career.
You wrestled Naomi last year at

18:33.659 --> 18:34.592
Money in the Bank for the title.

18:34.592 --> 18:35.659
This is higher stakes.

18:35.659 --> 18:37.592
Yeah, 'cause you're
gonna go higher, those ladders

18:37.592 --> 18:39.759
are high.
You have to climb the ladder to

18:39.759 --> 18:42.159
paint, you know.

18:42.159 --> 18:45.059
I am getting extremely,
extremely nervous about Money in

18:45.059 --> 18:47.359
the Bank ladder match.
This is a dangerous match.

18:47.359 --> 18:48.426
You'll be okay.

18:48.426 --> 18:50.392
I think I'm gonna throw
up right now, I'm so nervous.

18:50.392 --> 18:53.026
Just wait for me to
step away.

18:53.026 --> 18:56.459
I'm literally saying my
prayers every night that I live

18:56.459 --> 18:58.092
through all this.

18:58.092 --> 19:01.232
♪ And this my time
Oh, oh, oh, oh

19:01.232 --> 19:03.232
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh

19:03.232 --> 19:05.332
Oh, oh, oh, oh

19:08.032 --> 19:10.599
Welcome to the
Superstars that are gonna

19:10.599 --> 19:14.066
be representing the blue brand
this coming Sunday at the

19:14.066 --> 19:18.532
Women's Money in the Bank ladder
match. Lana!

19:18.532 --> 19:20.666
This is what I'm
training for and this is what I

19:20.666 --> 19:23.199
want and I want to prove to the
WWE Universe that I belong in

19:23.199 --> 19:24.466
that ring.

19:24.466 --> 19:27.466
I don't care which one
of you wins, as long as one of

19:27.466 --> 19:33.599
you brings this back to my house!

19:40.966 --> 19:44.966
I got a surprise for
you. And, no, I'm not pregnant.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.032
What is it?

19:46.032 --> 19:48.532
I'm taking you to a
tattoo shop.

19:48.532 --> 19:51.766
I wanted us to get tattooed
together on our wedding ring

19:51.766 --> 19:57.232
finger.
Because I don't always wear my

19:57.232 --> 19:59.906
wedding ring or have it on, I
think this is the perfect

19:59.906 --> 20:02.672
solution.
We've been through a few

20:02.672 --> 20:05.806
frustrating situations and I
think now this is the perfect

20:05.806 --> 20:06.772
time to do that.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.872
But you don't even like
needles.

20:08.872 --> 20:12.006
I know, but that way
you'll always know, like,

20:12.006 --> 20:16.806
you're‐you're here.
And I'm thinking about you and

20:16.806 --> 20:19.006
I'm representing you and I got
you.

20:19.006 --> 20:21.539
I appreciate the thought
but you don't have to get the

20:21.539 --> 20:22.539
tattoo.

20:22.539 --> 20:25.539
I know, babe.
I'm not doing it because I feel

20:25.539 --> 20:29.139
like I have to, I'm doing it
'cause I want to.

20:29.139 --> 20:32.439
I've never wanted any tattoos on
my body. I don't like needles.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.239
I've always heard that tattoos
hurt like a MOFO, but I feel

20:35.239 --> 20:38.439
like I just got to go through
with it and put his initials on

20:38.439 --> 20:40.239
me on our wedding fingers.
That way, when my ring isn't on,

20:40.239 --> 20:41.939
there's something there to
represent him.

20:41.939 --> 20:44.572
So what are
you guys looking to get tattooed?

20:44.572 --> 20:46.406
Matching tattoos on
our wedding finger.

20:46.406 --> 20:48.039
Cool.
All right, let me just turn my

20:48.039 --> 20:49.039
chair around.

20:49.039 --> 20:53.139
Don't pass out now.

20:53.139 --> 20:55.239
I feel good
about this.

20:55.239 --> 20:56.872
Here we go.

20:56.872 --> 20:57.772
Mm, gosh.

20:57.772 --> 20:59.979
All right,
we're a hundred percent?

20:59.979 --> 21:00.912
No.

21:00.912 --> 21:02.746
You better turn that
damn gun on now and stick her

21:02.746 --> 21:06.246
ass, dawg.
You better stick her right now.

21:06.246 --> 21:08.079
Oh, boy, I'm, like,
trying to not get nervous about

21:08.079 --> 21:10.079
this.
I can't believe I'm in a ladder

21:10.079 --> 21:11.946
match.
Four months ago, I wasn't even

21:11.946 --> 21:15.879
on TV. Here I am having a very
dangerous match.

21:15.879 --> 21:19.412
Lana has been
training hard. Oh, ho‐ho.

21:19.412 --> 21:22.312
The following
contest is for the Raw Women's

21:22.312 --> 21:24.979
Championship!

21:24.979 --> 21:27.712
I am literally just
running on fumes, on nerves.

21:27.712 --> 21:31.345
Boy, the
anticipation, you can feel it.

21:35.646 --> 21:36.646
Here we go.

21:36.646 --> 21:37.546
Mm, gosh.

21:37.546 --> 21:41.046
All right,
we're a hundred percent?

21:41.046 --> 21:43.746
No, but let's just
do it.

21:43.746 --> 21:45.546
Just do it, man.

21:45.546 --> 21:48.612
Oh, gosh.
When I hear the buzz of the

21:48.612 --> 21:51.679
needle, I just want to jump up
and run out of that tattoo shop.

21:51.679 --> 21:55.479
Like, no, no, don't touch me.
But...

21:55.479 --> 21:59.279
It's for Jon so I think it'll be
worth it.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.452
We're doing it.

22:02.452 --> 22:04.719
I mean, barely.
I'm barely pushing through.

22:04.719 --> 22:06.386
That's it.

22:06.386 --> 22:07.686
I'm done? That's it?

22:07.686 --> 22:09.686
All that for
that.

22:09.686 --> 22:10.452
Yay!

22:10.452 --> 22:12.386
You got your first
tattoo.

22:12.386 --> 22:13.419
Love it?

22:13.419 --> 22:14.419
I do.

22:14.419 --> 22:15.186
Awesome.

22:15.186 --> 22:18.186
There you go, man.
How'd it feel?

22:18.186 --> 22:19.252
This is nice.

22:19.252 --> 22:21.352
I'm glad you‐you like
your tattoo.

22:21.352 --> 22:22.486
I do.

22:22.486 --> 22:23.486
I'm glad you like it.

22:23.486 --> 22:25.486
I can't believe how
quick it was.

22:25.486 --> 22:27.486
That's what
she said.

22:29.019 --> 22:34.152
Booyah! Let me see.
Yeah, man.

22:34.152 --> 22:37.452
Seeing, uh, Jon and
I initials side by side on each

22:37.452 --> 22:40.152
other's ring finger, I think is
so special.

22:40.152 --> 22:43.319
This year is probably the
hardest conversations we've had

22:43.319 --> 22:46.186
in our marriage.
We've been together ten years

22:46.186 --> 22:49.652
and a lot has changed.
We're gonna always be evolving

22:49.652 --> 22:52.952
and changing but I just know
that no matter what, we're gonna

22:52.952 --> 22:56.086
rock with each other and be by
each other's side.

22:56.086 --> 22:59.252
And I'll always have this.
So now if I don't have my ring

22:59.252 --> 23:00.226
on, do you still feel okay?

23:00.226 --> 23:01.159
I'm all right.

23:01.159 --> 23:02.192
Are we cool?

23:02.192 --> 23:04.392
You just better tell
whoever trying to holler at you,

23:04.392 --> 23:05.392
"Sorry, I'm mar..."

23:05.392 --> 23:10.526
Yeah, I'll just go
like this.

23:10.526 --> 23:14.159
We are sold out at
the Allstate Arena in Chicago.

23:14.159 --> 23:18.726
Welcome, everyone, to Money in
the Bank.

23:20.726 --> 23:21.726
Morning.

23:21.726 --> 23:23.459
I'm not gonna walk
straight down because I could

23:23.459 --> 23:24.459
totally eat.

23:24.459 --> 23:26.759
Well, those heels are
like one inch tall, let's relax.

23:26.759 --> 23:29.526
Phew. It's dangerous for
a big person, how dare you.

23:29.526 --> 23:33.892
Ladies and gentlemen
of the WWE Universe, welcome to

23:33.892 --> 23:38.126
arguably the most hard‐hitting,
intense, career‐altering night

23:38.126 --> 23:39.092
of the year.

23:39.092 --> 23:40.126
Whoo!

23:40.126 --> 23:41.426
Hi, Bir‐Bird.

23:42.459 --> 23:44.226
Oh, she's saying I'm
waiting for the girls' Money in

23:44.226 --> 23:45.226
the Bank match.

23:45.226 --> 23:47.226
Aren't you so sad we're
not a part of it?

23:47.226 --> 23:49.326
I would do anything to
do Money in the Bank.

23:49.326 --> 23:51.492
I know.
Maybe next year.

23:51.492 --> 23:53.892
Everybody here knows
how important tonight is to so

23:53.892 --> 23:55.459
many of the Superstars.

23:55.459 --> 23:57.459
Oh, boy, I cannot
believe it.

23:57.459 --> 23:59.392
I'm, like, trying to not get
nervous about this.

23:59.392 --> 24:01.299
I can't believe I'm in a ladder
match.

24:03.532 --> 24:05.932
This is my first ever ladder
match.

24:05.932 --> 24:08.566
Last year, I asked to be in
Money in the Bank and I was told

24:08.566 --> 24:09.899
I had to prove myself.

24:09.899 --> 24:12.366
...see Russian
Lana making her official in‐ring

24:12.366 --> 24:13.599
debut.

24:13.599 --> 24:16.599
You're gonna hurt
yourself. Don't go sideways.

24:16.599 --> 24:18.366
You got to go in
there with some conviction, like

24:18.366 --> 24:19.332
you own this place.

24:19.332 --> 24:21.032
No, you see how you're
carrying it?

24:21.032 --> 24:22.666
That's not how you carry a
ladder.

24:22.666 --> 24:24.899
People don't want to see you do
this.

24:24.899 --> 24:26.866
This is a very
high‐stakes match.

24:26.866 --> 24:29.666
I'm very nervous but the time is
now.

24:29.666 --> 24:32.599
I probably will almost want to
throw up before I go‐‐ Oh.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.132
Are you excited about
your match?

24:39.132 --> 24:40.766
What's going on? Tell me.
Tell me, what's going on in your

24:40.766 --> 24:43.066
head?
What's going on in Nia's head?

24:43.066 --> 24:44.066
I'm excited as.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.066
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.899
I'm excited, but I'm
nervous, like, it's just, it's a

24:46.899 --> 24:47.899
lot.

24:47.899 --> 24:49.699
You're gonna do
perfect, I promise you.

24:49.699 --> 24:51.766
You were this nervous before you
went on to WrestleMania.

24:51.766 --> 24:54.032
This match has so many
eyes on it. Are you kidding me?

24:54.032 --> 24:55.666
But as soon as you
went out there, you looked

24:55.666 --> 24:57.532
gorgeous, you killed it.
And you're gonna do the same

24:57.532 --> 24:59.639
here.
And I'm gonna be there watching

24:59.639 --> 25:01.639
you every step of the goddamn
way.

25:01.639 --> 25:03.372
If you cry then I'll
cry.

25:03.372 --> 25:04.472
I'll start crying.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.739
You're crying, I'm not
crying.

25:07.739 --> 25:09.806
We'll both slap each
other.

25:09.806 --> 25:10.839
Stop it.

25:10.839 --> 25:13.239
It is a night
where dreams are realized and

25:13.239 --> 25:19.639
lives changed forever.
13,214 WWE fans on hand.

25:19.639 --> 25:21.106
Do you like this?

25:21.106 --> 25:23.139
Yeah. Gorgeous.
Turn around.

25:23.139 --> 25:23.806
You heard...

25:25.072 --> 25:26.972
All right, now squat.

25:26.972 --> 25:28.139
Give me a squat.

25:29.139 --> 25:32.006
Looks great from
behind. It looks tight.

25:32.006 --> 25:35.106
Welcome to
Chicago for Money in the Bank.

25:35.106 --> 25:37.439
Bird, Daddy's on.

25:37.439 --> 25:38.506
Is that Dada?

25:38.506 --> 25:41.506
Chicago, Illinois
is absolutely rabid for the

25:41.506 --> 25:44.839
"Yes" movement and Daniel Bryan.
This is a night all about

25:44.839 --> 25:47.106
opportunity changing lives.

25:47.106 --> 25:49.572
Yes! Yes! Yes!

25:49.572 --> 25:51.572
As you heard from
Daniel Bryan on the kickoff

25:51.572 --> 25:53.239
show, he is not lacking
confidence.

25:53.906 --> 25:56.139
Come on, Daddy.
Come on, Daddy.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.472
What do you think?

25:57.472 --> 26:02.646
Her eyes are glued.
I definitely think Brie wants

26:02.646 --> 26:06.246
Birdie to watch her wrestle
one day.

26:06.246 --> 26:09.012
I think as a woman in this
industry, especially having a

26:09.012 --> 26:12.046
daughter, nothing would make you
more proud than being in that

26:12.046 --> 26:14.179
ring and having your daughter
ringside watching you.

26:14.179 --> 26:16.546
And Bryan with
the knee!

26:16.546 --> 26:17.946
On the mark!

26:18.946 --> 26:21.379
Trying to crawl
out‐‐ taps! Taps again!

26:22.512 --> 26:25.846
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes!

26:25.846 --> 26:27.846
Look at Dada.
Look at his big old muscles.

26:27.846 --> 26:31.812
Here is your
winner, Daniel Bryan!

26:31.812 --> 26:34.012
We're into the second hour of
this incredible Money in the

26:34.012 --> 26:36.146
Bank.
Gentlemen, there are eight women

26:36.146 --> 26:38.346
back there right now that are
very, very nervous.

26:38.346 --> 26:41.479
Four months ago, I
wasn't even on TV, and here I

26:41.479 --> 26:44.146
am, having a ladder match with
some of the best women in the

26:44.146 --> 26:49.546
division. Nattie... Trin...
Becky... Charlotte...

26:49.546 --> 26:52.746
Ember Moon... Alexa Bliss.
I'm in there.

26:52.746 --> 26:56.179
I am the underdog of all the
underdogs, but I'm gonna show

26:56.179 --> 27:01.719
the WWE Universe that I belong
in that ring.

27:01.719 --> 27:04.752
And there it is,
superstars from both Raw and

27:04.752 --> 27:08.352
Smackdown Livewill compete.
The winner gets a contract for

27:08.352 --> 27:11.620
an opportunity at the Women's
Championship.

27:20.220 --> 27:22.394
Oh, my God! Wow!

27:22.394 --> 27:25.455
The match starts, and I
just go on the attack.

27:25.455 --> 27:29.022
Ah‐ha‐ha!
Rousey's got her in trouble.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.722
I don't think anybody
saw that coming.

27:30.722 --> 27:36.589
Nia's in trouble!

27:36.589 --> 27:40.789
The following
contest is the women's Money in

27:40.789 --> 27:44.559
the Bank ladder match!

27:55.492 --> 27:59.664
Pure chaos, pure
bedlam, broken ladders, broken

27:59.664 --> 28:05.684
bodies. Oh‐ho‐ho!
It's every woman for herself.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.408
No count‐outs, no
disqualifications.

28:07.408 --> 28:09.675
The only way to win is to climb
the ladder and retrieve the

28:09.675 --> 28:16.641
contract. Naomi!

28:20.075 --> 28:23.108
She's so incredibly
talented and athletic.

28:23.108 --> 28:25.875
Oh, wait a minute,
now, look at Naomi...

28:25.875 --> 28:29.241
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Wow! Naomi!

28:29.241 --> 28:30.541
Ah!

28:30.541 --> 28:33.908
Lana's down.
Naomi's got it!

28:33.908 --> 28:35.908
She's got it!
Naomi's gonna...

28:35.908 --> 28:39.041
Naomi unable to
get her bearings underneath her.

28:39.041 --> 28:46.741
Oh‐ho‐ho, down goes Bliss!

28:46.741 --> 28:48.775
Yeah, girl, get it.

28:48.775 --> 28:52.375
Lana!

28:52.375 --> 28:54.241
Yeah!

28:54.241 --> 28:56.675
I'm impressed by
Lana; I really, really am.

28:56.675 --> 28:57.941
Lana's doing good.

28:57.941 --> 28:59.348
She's doing great.

28:59.348 --> 29:01.548
Lana's come so far with
her wrestling.

29:01.548 --> 29:04.215
And the one thing I've always
admired about Lana is that she

29:04.215 --> 29:07.948
cares about her craft and she
wants to get better, but I envy

29:07.948 --> 29:10.381
her.
I would do anything to be part

29:10.381 --> 29:13.181
of Money in the Bank.
I need to come back.

29:13.181 --> 29:16.281
I've got to give
credit to the women in this

29:16.281 --> 29:17.481
match here tonight.

29:17.481 --> 29:20.748
This is
incredibly entertaining.

29:20.748 --> 29:28.548
Is that what you're
gonna be when you grow up? Oh...

29:28.548 --> 29:31.148
That was freakin'
sick.

29:31.148 --> 29:33.948
You take this moment, and you
just realize how far the women

29:33.948 --> 29:36.515
have come.
Every week, they raise the bar

29:36.515 --> 29:40.448
so high, and I'm just, like,
speechless, literally speechless

29:40.448 --> 29:44.181
right now.
Look at everyone on their feet.

29:44.181 --> 29:46.181
You can, like, feel the nerves
from here, huh?

29:46.181 --> 29:48.315
She's on the
ladder, and now Alexa Bliss is

29:48.315 --> 29:53.681
all by herself.
Alexa Bliss is Miss Money in the

29:53.681 --> 29:57.715
Bank!
Any time she wants, Alexa Bliss

29:57.715 --> 30:01.421
could cash in with a guaranteed
title opportunity.

30:01.421 --> 30:04.121
Even though I lost,
this is just the beginning, I am

30:04.121 --> 30:07.088
just getting started.
And I will always push myself to

30:07.088 --> 30:08.455
achieve more.

30:08.455 --> 30:12.055
Win or lose, I'm so
proud of all of us girls.

30:12.055 --> 30:14.621
The night is still
not over.

30:14.621 --> 30:17.821
Jax and Rousey, keep your heads
on a swivel.

30:17.821 --> 30:20.288
Boy, the
anticipation, you can feel it.

30:20.288 --> 30:24.355
The following
contest is for the Raw Women's

30:24.355 --> 30:26.755
Championship.

30:26.755 --> 30:30.921
Before any big match, I
get eerily calm.

30:34.821 --> 30:40.121
I am literally just running on
fumes, on nerves and anxiety and

30:40.121 --> 30:43.021
excitement.
And then I tell myself, "Go out

30:43.021 --> 30:47.355
there and show them why you're
the champ."

30:47.355 --> 30:54.321
Nia Jax!
Introducing the challenger,

30:54.321 --> 30:59.461
Rowdy Ronda Rousey!

31:11.561 --> 31:13.995
And here we go.
Nia Jax using her power to start

31:13.995 --> 31:16.661
this matchup, driving Rousey
into the corner.

31:16.661 --> 31:17.928
Oh, my God.

31:17.928 --> 31:20.428
Wow!

31:20.428 --> 31:21.661
How much did I miss?

31:21.661 --> 31:23.328
The match is so good
so far.

31:23.328 --> 31:25.028
Looking for the
guillotine now!

31:25.028 --> 31:27.028
Center of the ring, champ's in
trouble.

31:27.028 --> 31:29.028
The match starts, and
the crowd is already going nuts.

31:29.028 --> 31:31.828
They're so excited to see
Ronda, and I just go on the

31:31.828 --> 31:32.961
attack.

31:32.961 --> 31:35.995
Oh‐ho!
Nia's as confident as we have

31:35.995 --> 31:37.095
ever seen her.

31:37.095 --> 31:40.061
I don't think anybody
saw that coming.

31:40.061 --> 31:42.128
We have covered
Nia's entire career.

31:42.128 --> 31:45.528
This may be her best performance
by far.

31:50.195 --> 31:53.095
This last year...
I'm getting goose bumps thinking

31:53.095 --> 31:56.795
about it.
I feel incredibly proud in

31:56.795 --> 32:00.668
wrestling, in my life.
I've learned that with all the

32:00.668 --> 32:02.768
love and the friends and the
family that I have, I can

32:02.768 --> 32:05.101
accomplish anything, and I can

32:05.101 --> 32:06.801
look good doing it and

32:06.801 --> 32:08.468
kick some major ass.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.535
Uh‐oh, Rousey's
got her in trouble.

32:10.535 --> 32:15.201
Oh, my God, Alexa Bliss,
Miss Money in the Bank!

32:15.201 --> 32:18.368
Where in the
world... Oh!

32:18.368 --> 32:21.935
All of a sudden, Alexa
Bliss comes out.

32:21.935 --> 32:24.735
She's cashing in!
She's cashing in!

32:24.735 --> 32:27.268
And now Bliss, with a
championship opportunity against

32:27.268 --> 32:31.668
her former best friend, and the
woman who beat her for the title.

32:31.668 --> 32:36.868
Alexa Bliss with Twisted Bliss.

32:36.868 --> 32:39.435
One, two, three!

32:39.435 --> 32:41.901
Alexa Bliss is
champion!

32:41.901 --> 32:45.301
Here is your
winner, and the new Raw Women's

32:45.301 --> 32:48.368
Champion, Alexa Bliss!

32:50.601 --> 32:53.101
Even though I lost, and
I'm no longer the Raw Women's

32:53.101 --> 32:55.935
Champion, I'm really, really
proud.

32:55.935 --> 32:58.135
When we're out there, and we're
performing, and the crowd is

32:58.135 --> 33:00.275
just into it, like, there's
nothing better, and there's no

33:00.275 --> 33:01.575
better feeling.

33:01.575 --> 33:03.041
Women took over
tonight.

33:03.041 --> 33:05.775
Women took over!

33:12.841 --> 33:15.575
It was, like, 7:00 in the
morning, and my sister Jenni

33:15.575 --> 33:18.175
calls me.
And I thought it was really

33:18.175 --> 33:20.941
weird because Jenni never calls
me that early in the morning.

33:20.941 --> 33:26.375
And she just said really
quietly... she's like, "Daddy

33:26.375 --> 33:31.575
died."
I just thought my dad was gonna

33:31.575 --> 33:34.108
live forever.
I always looked at my dad as

33:34.108 --> 33:36.541
being somebody that was just
this unbreakable, unstoppable

33:36.541 --> 33:41.041
force.
He woke my mom up at around 6:30

33:41.041 --> 33:43.141
in the morning and said he felt
cold.

33:43.141 --> 33:47.508
And he went to fix something on
the air‐conditioning, and he

33:47.508 --> 33:51.575
collapsed.
Honestly, that was, like, just‐‐

33:51.575 --> 33:55.508
It was such a shocking moment
for me that I was, like‐‐

33:55.508 --> 34:01.248
I felt like I was in a dream
where I couldn't, like...

34:01.248 --> 34:04.415
I couldn't just get it together.
I just had to pack my bag, I've

34:04.415 --> 34:06.748
got to return my rental car.
I just have to get home.

34:06.748 --> 34:10.981
I'm not sure if you know about
what happened for the last

34:10.981 --> 34:13.815
weekend of my dad's life.
My dad hadn't seen his sister

34:13.815 --> 34:16.880
Debbie in 20 years.
And she came down to visit him,

34:16.880 --> 34:19.181
and the second he saw her, he
was just, like, enamored with

34:19.181 --> 34:21.181
her.
And he kept saying, "My sister.

34:21.181 --> 34:24.181
You're my sister. I love you."
And, like, he just kept...

34:24.181 --> 34:26.181
Like a little boy.
She brought all this old footage

34:26.181 --> 34:28.581
of my dad from when he was a
baby, when he was a toddler,

34:28.581 --> 34:30.348
when he was a kid, when he was a
teenager.

34:30.348 --> 34:31.815
You guys wouldn't have
seen any of that before.

34:31.815 --> 34:33.348
None of it.
We'd never seen any of it, and

34:33.348 --> 34:34.047
my dad was...

34:34.047 --> 34:35.481
He wouldn't have,
either, would he?

34:35.481 --> 34:36.981
My dad was wa... No.
And he was watching, and he

34:36.981 --> 34:38.815
goes, "That's my cat Tiger."
And he would just... he was

34:38.815 --> 34:41.014
watching the videos and
commenting, and he was, like,

34:41.014 --> 34:43.148
sitting on the couch with
perfect clarity, watching the

34:43.148 --> 34:47.614
memories of his life.
My dad had Alzheimer's, but the

34:47.614 --> 34:51.415
entire weekend before my dad
passed away, he just had this

34:51.415 --> 34:54.547
total clarity.
And it was almost like my dad

34:54.547 --> 34:56.815
was spending that weekend with
us, spending the weekend with

34:56.815 --> 34:59.155
his sister, watching this
highlight reel of his life, and

34:59.155 --> 35:01.221
my dad was saying good‐bye to
all of us without even knowing

35:01.221 --> 35:08.355
that he was saying good‐bye.

35:08.355 --> 35:10.988
Okay, let's scoot and skedaddle.
Mommy, let's go.

35:10.988 --> 35:11.988
Yeah, let's go.

35:11.988 --> 35:14.521
Having my whole
family come in from Canada for

35:14.521 --> 35:16.721
my dad's funeral, I think it's
really great.

35:16.721 --> 35:19.521
It's just been so nice to have
the support of the family and

35:19.521 --> 35:22.088
our friends going above and
beyond.

35:24.355 --> 35:28.855
I want to make sure he has the
best send‐off ever.

35:29.855 --> 35:31.855
I think this would be nice,
Mommy.

35:31.855 --> 35:33.855
You know, what I wish
we had is, like, a corkboard of

35:33.855 --> 35:35.721
putting other pictures.
Do you know what I mean?

35:35.721 --> 35:37.721
Oh, I love that,
Diana.

35:37.721 --> 35:38.721
And his baby shoes.

35:38.721 --> 35:43.621
So cute.
I want people to know that,

35:43.621 --> 35:51.488
like, we love my dad so much and
that, you know, he's making us

35:51.488 --> 35:53.788
cry so much because he was that
great.

35:53.788 --> 35:56.121
This is the best of
Daddy's life right here.

35:56.121 --> 36:00.295
And I just want him
to have that last little

36:00.295 --> 36:02.295
spotlight, that forever
spotlight.

36:02.295 --> 36:04.161
This display is looking
absolutely beautiful.

36:04.161 --> 36:06.528
Oh, yeah, this is
perfect. There isn't any more.

36:06.528 --> 36:09.461
This is just what I wanted.
Everything‐‐ his family, his

36:09.461 --> 36:14.695
dreams, his medals‐‐ everything
that he's about is on this table.

36:14.695 --> 36:17.295
And I know my dad
would have loved that, because

36:17.295 --> 36:19.295
he loved being a part of <i>Total</i>
Divas.

36:19.295 --> 36:25.361
I think he would be so happy
that we included him like we

36:25.361 --> 36:31.228
always did.

36:31.228 --> 36:32.261
No, you're not,

36:32.261 --> 36:32.895
Daddy.

36:32.895 --> 36:34.228
Whoa!
Wait‐wait, wait a minute, wait,

36:34.228 --> 36:35.628
wait, wait. I got it, I got it.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.961
Don't drop it, Daddy,
or I'll be furious.

36:39.728 --> 36:40.761
Holy.

36:47.495 --> 36:49.961
I have something for
you. This was your dad's rosary.

36:49.961 --> 36:53.895
He wanted me to give it back to
you.

36:53.895 --> 36:58.768
Thank you.

37:00.834 --> 37:07.568
I need to get it together.

37:21.601 --> 37:27.635
I just loved Daddy so much.
It's so hard to wrap my head

37:27.635 --> 37:30.368
around the fact that I'm not
gonna see my dad again.

37:30.368 --> 37:35.001
Like, I'm not gonna see him
again. It just blows my mind.

37:35.001 --> 37:40.835
But, um, it does bring me peace
knowing that my dad passed away

37:40.835 --> 37:44.735
in his own house, with the
comfort of my mom being there,

37:44.735 --> 37:46.568
the person that he loved the
most.

37:46.568 --> 37:48.135
You remember Katie
took this picture.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.701
That ended up in the Christmas
card picture.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.101
Of course, he's got no shirt on,
you know, being Jim, you know.

37:52.101 --> 37:54.468
That's what I loved about it.

37:54.468 --> 37:57.068
He never had to go
into a nursing home.

37:57.068 --> 38:01.908
He never had to get to the stage
where he didn't know who we were.

38:01.908 --> 38:07.108
He still died on his terms.
And I think my dad was just, I

38:07.108 --> 38:12.608
think it was just his time, but
it's always hard, it's just hard

38:12.608 --> 38:19.508
to know how to say good‐bye.

38:19.508 --> 38:27.408
I had no idea that saying
good‐bye to my dad would be this

38:27.408 --> 38:34.275
hard. My dad was my rock star.
This is what I wore to win the

38:34.275 --> 38:37.741
title in, and this jacket is
your jacket that you wore when

38:37.741 --> 38:40.508
you won the championship.
I'm glad that I got to follow in

38:40.508 --> 38:41.508
his footsteps.

38:41.508 --> 38:42.708
My daughter Natalie.

38:42.708 --> 38:43.375
Hello.

38:43.375 --> 38:46.675
Another Hart
family memory at SummerSlam!

38:46.675 --> 38:49.141
My dad would
compliment every match like it

38:49.141 --> 38:52.241
was a WrestleMania moment.
He would send me random text

38:52.241 --> 38:55.675
messages to work on my dropkicks
and get at least two dropkicks

38:55.675 --> 38:56.708
in every match.

38:59.348 --> 39:02.881
I just realize that I'm not
gonna say good‐bye, because my

39:02.881 --> 39:08.548
dad is gonna be with us forever.
Daddy, smile.

39:08.548 --> 39:11.681
I'm gonna work really hard on
those dropkicks, and I'm gonna

39:11.681 --> 39:15.615
aim as high as I can.
And we love you forever, Daddy.

39:15.615 --> 39:20.048
Thank you for being you.
And Daddy, I promise to keep

39:20.048 --> 39:23.881
your memory alive, and I'm gonna
continue to pay it forward.

39:31.848 --> 39:33.815
You are the reason I
watch wrestling.

39:33.815 --> 39:36.381
Thank you so much for everything
you've done.

39:36.381 --> 39:37.215
One, two, three.

39:37.215 --> 39:38.948
Team Neidhart!

39:46.015 --> 39:47.515
Do you need anything?

39:47.515 --> 39:49.381
I'm good.
I'm good, I'm just feeling kind

39:49.381 --> 39:52.648
of stressed out, because
SummerSlam is on Sunday.

39:52.648 --> 39:55.448
I've been struggling to figure
out what to do.

39:55.448 --> 39:59.321
I don't want to just sit and
dwell on Daddy's death.

39:59.321 --> 40:01.421
And, like, I feel like Daddy
would want me to be there.

40:01.421 --> 40:04.388
I think you really
need this. I think you should go.

40:04.388 --> 40:07.288
Like, it'll be one more
opportunity for Daddy's

40:07.288 --> 40:08.921
limelight to...

40:08.921 --> 40:09.555
Shine.

40:09.555 --> 40:11.255
...shine.

40:11.255 --> 40:12.055
You sure, Muffy?

40:12.055 --> 40:13.121
One hundred fifty

40:13.121 --> 40:14.788
percent, you need to go.

40:39.055 --> 40:41.522
I'm so sorry, Nattie.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.990
It's nice to see you.

40:43.990 --> 40:45.527
Nice to see you.
I'm sorry to hear about your dad.

40:45.527 --> 40:46.978
How you feeling?

40:46.978 --> 40:48.901
I feel like it's just
gonna take some time.

40:48.901 --> 40:50.160
It does take time.

40:50.160 --> 40:50.660
Yeah.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.888
Like, even now, 'cause
with it happening to you, I

40:52.888 --> 40:56.188
start thinking about it, about
my dad, and it's just, like,

40:56.188 --> 40:57.755
you know, it comes back.

40:57.755 --> 41:00.461
My dad and I had this
special bond, that we shared the

41:00.461 --> 41:03.595
same career.
We were both WWE Superstars.

41:03.595 --> 41:08.261
And so, to be able to celebrate
that bond that we had and that

41:08.261 --> 41:10.961
we will have, actually, forever,
to be able to celebrate that and

41:10.961 --> 41:13.728
share that with the entire
world, not everybody gets the

41:13.728 --> 41:14.661
chance to do that.

41:14.661 --> 41:16.395
Aw.

41:16.395 --> 41:19.228
I actually sent my
dad pictures of us at Lake Tahoe.

41:19.228 --> 41:21.361
I remember, actually,
you telling us that, that he

41:21.361 --> 41:28.161
would go there as a kid.
I loved all his little‐‐ aw. Aw.

41:28.161 --> 41:32.628
It's okay.

41:32.628 --> 41:34.428
Just when I thought I
wasn't gonna cry today.

41:34.428 --> 41:37.495
No, I know.
And let it out.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.128
You don't need to hold it in.

41:39.128 --> 41:42.728
Everybody goes
through tough times, and when

41:42.728 --> 41:44.695
you feel sad, you need to let it
out.

41:44.695 --> 41:46.695
When you feel happy, you need to
be happy.

41:46.695 --> 41:51.195
And having the support of Brie
and Nicole, and Paige and Lana,

41:51.195 --> 41:54.695
you couldn't really ask for
better friends.

42:01.935 --> 42:04.835
You are looking
live at a sold‐out Barclays

42:04.835 --> 42:08.501
Center in Brooklyn.
Welcome, everybody, to

42:08.501 --> 42:16.468
SummerSlam.

42:28.171 --> 42:30.404
My dad had one really
prized possession.

42:30.404 --> 42:33.771
It was the jacket that he wore
when he won the tag team

42:33.771 --> 42:36.238
championships.
And, of course, in true WWE

42:36.238 --> 42:41.671
Universe fashion, our fans,
everybody backstage, everybody

42:41.671 --> 42:46.004
at home, everybody understood
why I wore the jacket.

42:46.004 --> 42:49.104
Natalya is
wearing the jacket that her

42:49.104 --> 42:52.471
father wore in 1990 at
SummerSlam.

42:52.471 --> 42:55.938
My dad was just with
me, and I know he was with me,

42:55.938 --> 42:58.371
and I know it was meant to be,
and he wanted me to be there.

42:58.371 --> 43:03.111
And I'm so happy and so grateful
that I went to SummerSlam.

43:10.178 --> 43:13.144
I'm single, no kids.
I'm feeling young and fun and

43:13.144 --> 43:13.844
