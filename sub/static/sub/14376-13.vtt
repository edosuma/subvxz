17:10.033 --> 17:10.483
[Growl]

17:11.016 --> 17:13.300
Help! Help! Save me!
I'm a genius!

17:13.333 --> 17:15.216
Save the brain!
Save the brain!

17:15.250 --> 17:20.283
Dexter,
I haven't finished
my story yet.

17:20.316 --> 17:22.283
Wah!

17:22.316 --> 17:23.483
[Panting]

17:24.016 --> 17:25.466
[Crying]

17:35.250 --> 17:37.200
[Crash]

17:37.233 --> 17:39.483
My lab!

17:48.083 --> 17:51.083
Shut up!

17:51.400 --> 17:54.016
This is unacceptable!

17:54.050 --> 17:56.200
You want to torture me?
Fine,

17:56.233 --> 17:58.416
but when you mess
with the lab,

17:58.450 --> 18:01.100
there will be
a Piper to pay.

18:01.133 --> 18:03.483
It is time to fight fire
with fire.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.383
I'm coming after you.

18:10.366 --> 18:14.133
Uh...uh...

18:17.383 --> 18:21.383
[Growl]

18:24.416 --> 18:26.083
Oops.

18:26.116 --> 18:28.150
[Whistling]

18:29.300 --> 18:34.250
You<i>w</i>
to my story!

18:36.416 --> 18:38.400
Whew!

18:40.400 --> 18:43.200
Oh, Dexter! Dexter!

18:43.233 --> 18:46.150
Now where did he go?

18:50.050 --> 18:53.250
Ahh. Peace at last.

19:08.033 --> 19:09.233
[Ring]

19:09.266 --> 19:11.383
[Yawn]

19:15.166 --> 19:19.383
[Growl]

19:19.416 --> 19:21.383
So anyway,
the boy told her

19:21.416 --> 19:23.483
that he liked ponies,
too.

19:24.016 --> 19:25.066
No. Wait a second.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.383
Maybe it was the<i>boy</i>
who rode in on a pony.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.100
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

19:30.133 --> 19:31.166
Aah!

19:31.200 --> 19:35.150
Well, nonetheless,
it was a pink pony, and--

19:39.050 --> 19:42.033
oh, Dexter! Dexter!

19:48.066 --> 19:51.133
Aah! Monster!

19:51.166 --> 19:53.400
[Burp]

19:56.183 --> 20:00.400
Dee Dee: Oh,
there you are,
Dexter.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.100
So let's continue.

20:08.133 --> 20:11.083
The boy and the girl
were in the park,

20:11.116 --> 20:13.383
and the pink pony
brought some snacks--

20:13.416 --> 20:17.100
I'm sorry, miss, but
we have a one monster
per building rule.

20:17.133 --> 20:20.016
I'm going to have to
give you a ticket.

20:20.050 --> 20:23.416
Now then,
I'll need your license
and registration.

20:26.416 --> 20:31.033
Uh-huh. We'll just
send you a bill.

20:31.066 --> 20:35.233
Hey, Dexter!
I see you!

20:44.383 --> 20:46.283
This ends now!

20:46.316 --> 20:48.416
But I'm not finished!

20:48.450 --> 20:50.300
Hyah!

20:50.333 --> 20:52.166
Hyah!

20:54.266 --> 20:56.150
Nitro-punch!

20:56.183 --> 20:59.000
Mud saw!

21:01.483 --> 21:03.366
Tail rip!

21:03.400 --> 21:06.233
Squid attack!

21:06.266 --> 21:09.366
Monkey mouth!

21:11.000 --> 21:13.166
Octo-bash!

21:13.200 --> 21:15.233
Aah! Aah!

21:16.350 --> 21:18.016
Now you'll listen.

21:18.050 --> 21:22.333
So the boy told the girl
in the park on the pony,

21:22.366 --> 21:24.283
"knock knock."

21:24.316 --> 21:26.233
No!
