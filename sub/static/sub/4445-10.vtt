00:01.668 --> 00:05.137
- <i>Previously on</i> the strain.
- Dad, what's happening?

00:05.139 --> 00:07.840
- This is part of the epidemic
we've been investigating.

00:07.842 --> 00:10.376
Matt was infected.
Now I need you to tell me:

00:10.378 --> 00:12.378
When was the last time
you heard from your mother?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.980
- This morning. They were
arguing about you because you

00:14.982 --> 00:18.217
Told us to go to vermont. Matt
didn't come home last night.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.652
- Do you know who
eldritch palmer is?

00:20.654 --> 00:22.821
- One of the most powerful men
in the world, yes.

00:22.823 --> 00:25.024
- He hired me.
- What did you do?

00:25.026 --> 00:27.626
- I worked my ass off to shut
the internet down.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.828
- We can get the master.
He's nesting. Somewhere in

00:29.830 --> 00:31.697
The city. But I need your help.
- Where's kelly?

00:31.699 --> 00:34.133
- Kelly's mia all day.
Where's zack, eph?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.168
- He's with my colleagues.
- It's not safe here.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.470
- Right, right.
In all your concerned state,

00:38.472 --> 00:40.539
You still find time
to screw on the rug?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.641
- She's serious. You have to get
out of town as soon as possible.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.644
- You hurt my friend,
I will cut your heart out.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.747
- I love my wife.
She's the mother of my son.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.550
I'd do anything to find her.

01:47.540 --> 01:50.676
- Yes!

01:56.049 --> 01:58.283
Aw, crap.

02:20.840 --> 02:25.010
(beep! Beep! Beep!)

02:28.915 --> 02:32.751
No, come on! Please! Work!

02:39.792 --> 02:41.927
Yes!

02:46.032 --> 02:48.433
Dad! Dad, come here!

02:48.435 --> 02:51.136
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Mom's phone, it moved.

02:51.138 --> 02:54.439
She's moving.
- What are you talking about?

02:54.441 --> 02:56.441
- I lost my phone a couple
months ago. I used this website

02:56.443 --> 02:58.377
To track it. So I thought,
you know, maybe we could

02:58.379 --> 03:00.445
Use it on her.
- You got online?

03:00.447 --> 03:03.382
- Barely. It's super slow, but I
finally got enough of a signal.

03:03.384 --> 03:06.652
It's going in and out but I got
enough to see the phone move.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.720
(beep! Beep!)

03:08.722 --> 03:12.391
- You're sure it's moving?
- Yeah. Like 3 blocks.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.860
If she's moving,
she's gotta be ok, right?

03:14.862 --> 03:17.896
- It's a good sign.
- I'm going to call her.

03:23.236 --> 03:27.539
(dialing)

03:29.576 --> 03:33.078
Dad, it's ringing.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.080
- (answering machine): <i>Hi,</i>
<i>it's kelly. Leave me a message</i>

03:35.082 --> 03:37.049
<i>And I'll call you right back.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

03:37.051 --> 03:40.686
- Mom, it's me again.
Call me back, ok? Please?

03:40.688 --> 03:45.190
Maybe it's on silent
or something.

03:45.192 --> 03:48.393
Why hasn't she called back?

03:50.096 --> 03:52.497
- What was the location?
- This says...

03:52.499 --> 03:55.901
Main and front.

03:55.903 --> 04:00.339
No! Come on, please! Work!
- Shh. It's ok. It's ok.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.675
We know her location.

04:03.677 --> 04:07.479
I'll get her.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.522
(theme music)

04:29.636 --> 04:32.070
- (radio): <i>The president has</i>
<i>declared a bank holiday</i>

04:32.072 --> 04:34.039
<i>In an attempt to stabilize</i>
<i>the nation's teetering</i>

04:34.041 --> 04:36.074
<i>Financial system.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

04:36.076 --> 04:38.410
- Hey.
-  <i>This latest move comes</i>

04:38.412 --> 04:40.412
In the wake of 23 bank failures
<i>yesterday. Despite</i>

04:40.414 --> 04:42.547
<i>These measures, the head of</i>
<i>the international monetary fund</i>

04:42.549 --> 04:45.384
<i>Hinted in</i>
<i>a news conference today</i>

04:45.386 --> 04:47.319
That the world financial system
<i>is now teetering</i>

04:47.321 --> 04:51.590
<i>On the brink of systematic--</i>
<i>- what's going on?</i>

04:51.592 --> 04:54.893
- Zack tracked down
kelly's phone.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.236
- Good morning, mrs. Martinez.
The phone is moving.

05:04.238 --> 05:06.338
- Where is it?
- Astoria.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.007
Don't say it.
- I wasn't gonna.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.410
- Kelly could be alive.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.578
The phone is moving during
daylight. She could've

05:13.580 --> 05:15.747
Gotten out without
getting stung. We did.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.750
- They're mobilizing downstairs.
Setrakian has a plan.

05:18.752 --> 05:22.354
- I have to do this first.

05:22.356 --> 05:26.091
I didn't mean
to hurt you last night.

05:26.093 --> 05:29.695
Nothing makes any sense anymore.
I don't know what I'm saying,

05:29.697 --> 05:32.931
What I'm doing, but I knew
what I was doing <i>then.</i>

05:32.933 --> 05:37.636
I'm not sorry about that.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.705
I know you tried to prepare me
for the worst

05:39.707 --> 05:42.107
But I think there's
a real chance here

05:42.109 --> 05:46.645
And so long as there is--
- then you should go.

05:46.647 --> 05:51.616
But you must be prepared
for what you might find.

05:51.618 --> 05:55.654
- I get it.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.623
- Take your weapons.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.069
- Any change?
- Still in the same place.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.171
- Can't I come? I don't want
to just sit here.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.207
- No, I need you
to track the phone.

06:15.209 --> 06:18.243
Text me if the signal moves.
- What if it doesn't go through?

06:18.245 --> 06:21.380
- Keep texting.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.815
- Bring mom back with you.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.922
- I tracked the epicenter
of the rat-free zone

06:30.924 --> 06:33.024
Right down here
by the world trade center.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.761
I popped down into the tunnels
to investigate,

06:35.763 --> 06:40.932
Ended up eye-to-eye with a few
dozen of them. It was a fun day.

06:40.934 --> 06:45.003
In my opinion, attacking them
head-on on their own turf seems

06:45.005 --> 06:47.038
Like a good way
for us all to die.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.709
The thing about rats is they
always have a backdoor -

06:50.711 --> 06:53.278
That's why it's so tricky
to catch them.

06:53.280 --> 06:57.716
I bet that the vamps...
I bet you they have one, too.

06:57.718 --> 07:02.254
So this is my thinking, alright?
We have to look

07:02.256 --> 07:04.623
At all the decommissioned
tunnels and lines

07:04.625 --> 07:08.393
Near the world trade center.
Which this map...

07:08.395 --> 07:11.963
Doesn't help us very much.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.133
It'd be great to get online,
I know this great

07:15.135 --> 07:19.204
Transit archive on there.
The internet's for shit, so...

07:23.376 --> 07:25.944
- Yeah, sorry about for that.
- About what?

07:28.080 --> 07:33.718
- I brought it down.
- Uh... I think I missed that.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.255
- Yeah, not just me...
But my crew.

07:37.257 --> 07:44.796
An old rich guy hired us
to interrupt mobile services

07:44.798 --> 07:49.568
And crash most internet traffic.
- Eldritch palmer.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.803
- Preventing the spread
of information.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.907
- And you helped him?!
- I never wanted to hurt people.

07:55.909 --> 08:00.479
I have been trying to figure out
a way to make things right.

08:00.481 --> 08:04.349
- Can you do that?
- Maybe.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.952
If I can get back
into palmer's offices.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.988
- How would you get access?
- I could get her in.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.325
Use my city credentials.
Fly under the radar.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.994
Sure, I could be your boss.
- Assistant.

08:15.996 --> 08:20.031
- Boss.
- Details.

08:20.033 --> 08:24.503
I always wanted to get into
that building.

08:41.053 --> 08:44.756
- (man): Keep up, let's go!

08:55.701 --> 08:58.236
(glass shatters)
(screams)

08:58.238 --> 09:01.540
- (man): Hey baby, the world
about to end. You want--

09:03.242 --> 09:06.044
- Hey, where'd you get
that phone?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.013
- That's mine. That's my phone.
- I know you stole it.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.316
Where's the woman
you took it from?

09:13.352 --> 09:16.087
Where'd you find it?!
- Back off or I'm not

09:16.089 --> 09:19.157
Telling you shit.

09:22.495 --> 09:25.664
I found this on the street.
Wasn't any woman with it.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.600
- You're gonna show me where--
- show me your badge po-po.

09:28.602 --> 09:32.103
- Do I look like a cop?
I'm a doctor.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.006
For real?

09:35.008 --> 09:38.443
It's infected.

09:38.445 --> 09:41.279
- Jesus christ that's
a bad burn. How long

09:41.281 --> 09:43.915
Have you had that?
- Got it last week.

09:50.456 --> 09:54.025
- Ok, brea. Where did you
find the phone?

09:55.962 --> 09:59.931
- Help me up.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.636
Agh.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.205
Thank you.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.796
There. It was right there.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.065
- Did you see the woman driving?
- No.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.109
(growling)

11:25.951 --> 11:28.720
(quiet growling)

11:57.983 --> 12:00.151
(faucet running)

12:02.321 --> 12:05.824
(knock! Knock! Knock!)
- matt?

12:09.228 --> 12:12.263
Matt?!

12:12.265 --> 12:15.500
(running water)

12:20.239 --> 12:22.273
(sighs)
you know not talking is part

12:22.275 --> 12:24.576
Of what ended my marriage.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.112
(matt whimpers)

12:27.114 --> 12:30.849
God! Way to be a grownup!

12:33.452 --> 12:36.221
Look, if you don't want to talk,
at least let me in.

12:36.223 --> 12:40.325
I need to get ready for work.
(faucet running)

12:49.468 --> 12:53.605
- (kid): She's so mean.
- Hey, you're here.

12:53.607 --> 12:57.809
- It's a school day, right?
- Yeah, but like half the kids

12:57.811 --> 13:01.780
Are out. Most of the staff, too.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.082
- Are they sick?
- I guess.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.718
A bunch of them didn't even
bother to call in.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.787
Miranda is going
to release the kids early.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.723
No point with
barely half attendance.

13:11.725 --> 13:14.159
What?

13:14.161 --> 13:18.096
Do you know something?

13:18.098 --> 13:21.800
- Eph warned me about a virus.
Something to do

13:21.802 --> 13:23.835
With that plane at jfk.
Said we should leave town.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.805
- Seriously?

13:26.807 --> 13:28.740
Oh god.

13:28.742 --> 13:31.843
If you want
to let miranda know.

13:31.845 --> 13:35.246
But I'm getting zack
and I'm getting out of town.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.750
You should, too.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.691
Matt?

13:46.693 --> 13:48.760
Where are you?

13:48.762 --> 13:53.464
Called a half day at school.
Everyone is sick. Eph was right.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.367
Matt?

13:56.369 --> 13:58.770
(sighs)
enough already!

13:58.772 --> 14:02.273
Did you hear me? Eph was right.

14:02.275 --> 14:06.444
And you had him arrested
by the fbi--

14:06.446 --> 14:10.615
Oh my god, matt?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.889
Wah! Ah!

14:20.993 --> 14:24.462
Gah!

14:24.464 --> 14:27.565
Gah!!!

14:27.567 --> 14:30.401

Oh my word. Are you ok?

17:43.229 --> 17:47.365
- Where's zack?
I'm here to pick him up.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.767
Am I late?

17:49.769 --> 17:53.371
- I--
- I think I'm late.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.706
- We dismissed early
and when we couldn't reach you,

17:55.708 --> 17:58.342
Your friend diane came
to pick him up, I mean...

17:58.344 --> 18:02.013
I know that you carpool.
Look, kelly,

18:02.015 --> 18:05.283
I think maybe you've been
in an accident and we should

18:05.285 --> 18:08.853
Get you to a hospital.
- Can you get zack for me?

18:08.855 --> 18:13.091
Please?
- Mm-hmm. I uh...

18:13.093 --> 18:17.462
If you'll just excuse me,
I'm just going to make one call,

18:17.464 --> 18:20.898
Ok? I'll be right back.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.135
(whimpering in pain)

18:26.405 --> 18:29.040
I'm guessing that she's been
in a car accident

18:29.042 --> 18:32.110
And I think that
she has a concussion.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.879

They'll believe it.
- Sure.

You know this isn't my first

20:22.655 --> 20:26.023

the old pawn shop guy?

20:26.025 --> 20:28.826
How are you friends with him?

20:28.828 --> 20:31.262
- Met him last night.
Same as you.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.864
- Really? Huh.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.067
Seemed to have such a shorthand.

20:37.703 --> 20:41.639
- What about you?
What's your story?

20:43.342 --> 20:46.110
- No story.
What you see is what you get.

20:46.112 --> 20:51.115
- Listen, honey. The pawn shop
guy is a vampire killer.

20:51.117 --> 20:55.920
If you could top that story with
your mysterious background,

20:55.922 --> 20:58.055
Then... Go for it.

20:58.057 --> 21:02.260
- Fine. What do you want
to know about me?

21:02.262 --> 21:06.964
- This guy palmer.
Guy dicks you over

21:06.966 --> 21:10.468
To bring about end times?

21:10.470 --> 21:13.904
If we're going to his building
just to borrow his wifi

21:13.906 --> 21:17.041
Then you're wasting my time.

21:20.212 --> 21:24.148
- I wouldn't dream
of wasting your time.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.929
- Hello.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.065
Uh, new york pest control
services.

21:41.067 --> 21:45.569
We have to inspect your
executive dining facilities.

21:45.571 --> 21:48.072
- I don't have you down here.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.408
- Hmm. Well they don't let us
make appointments

21:50.410 --> 21:53.744
For inspections, you know?
- I can't let you through

21:53.746 --> 21:57.682
Without an ok from security.
- You're sure about that?

21:57.684 --> 22:00.584
It's pretty much
just a quick look-see.

22:00.586 --> 22:04.689
You know, another box I have to
check off for my hard-ass boss.

22:04.691 --> 22:08.192
In and out in 10?

22:08.194 --> 22:10.961
Hm?

22:10.963 --> 22:14.098
- Well, it looks like executive
dining is in between shifts

22:14.100 --> 22:18.002
Anyway. So...
- Oh, perfect.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.708
- Middle elevator. 25th floor.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.711
- Thanks lauren.
You're the best.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.646
And you have yourself
a great day, ok?

22:28.648 --> 22:32.083
- Ok.
- Thanks.

22:33.952 --> 22:37.355
- Confidence.
It's all about confidence.

22:40.125 --> 22:44.462
- Will you follow us, please?
- Confidence or competence?

22:49.067 --> 22:51.669
- Now look, I don't want
to get you boys in trouble.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.638
But as pest inspectors
for the city of new york,

22:54.640 --> 22:57.641
We have the absolute right
to enter any licenced food--

22:57.643 --> 22:59.877
- Hey. Shut up.

23:08.086 --> 23:11.255
- Alright. Thank you.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.527
- Ms. Valders.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.929
Reggie fitzwilliam,
you remember me?

23:18.931 --> 23:21.232
'cause I certainly remember you.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.534
I see you've taken up
rat catching.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.903
- So it appears.

23:27.606 --> 23:30.608
- Search them.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.677
- Don't touch me.

23:54.065 --> 23:57.935
- Use these for catching rats?
- Only really big ones.

24:01.606 --> 24:04.775
So what now?
- Mr. Palmer would like

24:04.777 --> 24:08.112
To see you.
No, not you.

24:08.114 --> 24:12.216
Her. Alone.

24:45.951 --> 24:48.018
(car alarm in distance)

24:48.020 --> 24:51.922
- Kelly?

24:58.263 --> 25:01.899
You here?

25:09.875 --> 25:12.543
- <i>We're live at the scene of</i>

25:12.545 --> 25:16.280
Of bizarre murders. This tragic
<i>incident claimed the lives</i>

25:16.282 --> 25:19.316
<i>Of a young married couple here</i>
<i>in brooklyn tonight.</i>

25:19.318 --> 25:21.552
They were found in the basement
<i>of their home</i>

25:21.554 --> 25:24.855
<i>After a neighbor complained</i>
<i>of a terrible smell</i>

25:24.857 --> 25:26.824
<i>Emanating from inside.</i>
<i>(police sirens)</i>

25:26.826 --> 25:30.494
Police sources say a disturbing
<i>pattern of random violence</i>

25:30.496 --> 25:32.496
<i>Has swept across</i>
<i>new york city.</i> (lock clicks)

25:32.498 --> 25:36.000
<i>In recent days, police have</i>
<i>been inundated with reports</i>

25:36.002 --> 25:39.770
Of home invasions and attacks--
(helicopters whirring)

25:44.676 --> 25:47.711
- Oh my god! Oh my god, kel!

25:47.713 --> 25:50.781
You scared the crap out of me.
What time is it?

25:54.719 --> 25:56.720
Kel?

25:56.722 --> 25:59.423
(whimpering)

25:59.425 --> 26:01.659
Kelly?

26:03.929 --> 26:07.665
Matt did this?
Are you serious?

26:11.102 --> 26:13.070
- (weakly): Where's zack...?
- What--

26:13.072 --> 26:15.105
What do you mean where's zack?
Eph said zack was with him.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.408
Kel, honey, you know what?
You're freaking me out, ok?

26:17.410 --> 26:19.443
So I'm going to take you
to the emergency room, ok?

26:19.445 --> 26:22.413
- Mom?

26:22.415 --> 26:25.983
What's... What's going on?

26:34.893 --> 26:38.762
- Ah! Ah! Kelly! What the--

26:38.764 --> 26:41.799
Ah! What the hell
are you doing?!

26:41.801 --> 26:43.801
What are you doing?! No!

26:43.803 --> 26:47.771
Ah! Ah!

26:59.317 --> 27:02.353
H-- oh--

27:14.065 --> 27:16.233
(quiet growling)

27:28.279 --> 27:30.514
- Ok.

27:39.457 --> 27:42.593
- Why in god's name would you
ever come back here?

27:42.595 --> 27:45.362
- Because I don't like being
taken for a ride.

27:45.364 --> 27:48.866
Now I know that palmer's
behind all this.

27:48.868 --> 27:52.369
Evidently you're fine
with being his lackey. I am not.

27:52.371 --> 27:57.207
- Mr. Palmer is very ill.
I won't let you harm him.

27:57.209 --> 28:01.311
If you try anything,
anything at all, I'll kill you.

28:01.313 --> 28:04.281
Am I clear?

28:20.131 --> 28:22.566
Ms. Valders. As requested.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.802
- Ah. Ms. Valders.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.540
I so admire your pluck.
Thinking you and

28:29.542 --> 28:33.677
- Who? A rat catcher? -
Could come here and... What?

28:33.679 --> 28:35.879
Dispense with me?

28:35.881 --> 28:40.017
The mind boggles
at the absurdity of the plan.

28:40.019 --> 28:43.387
But the ego behind it...
Audacious.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.223
- You lied to me.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.326
- Did we have a deeper
transaction than I recall?

28:49.328 --> 28:53.931
I bought you. You let me.
- Are you a vampire, too?

28:53.933 --> 28:57.201
- Hardly.

28:57.203 --> 29:01.572
- You wanted to bring the world
down. Wipe out the human race.

29:01.574 --> 29:04.241
Why would any rational person
want to do such a thing?

29:04.243 --> 29:06.343
- First, don't deny yourself
due credit.

29:06.345 --> 29:10.180
You should be taking a bow.
You did exceptional work.

29:10.182 --> 29:14.084
Truly. I couldn't have
done this without you.

29:14.086 --> 29:18.789
Human dna decays as we age.

29:18.791 --> 29:23.093
Over time, it frays and it fails
and we follow suit.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.096
But, it's a code
that can be rewritten.

29:26.098 --> 29:30.033
Rewrite the software
and you control the hardware:

29:30.035 --> 29:33.303
The meat, muscle,
and tissue that is mankind.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.440
- To what end?
- If hacking is about exploring

29:36.442 --> 29:40.544
The limits of what is possible,
then I am on the verge

29:40.546 --> 29:45.282
Of achieving what you would
consider the ultimate hack.

29:45.284 --> 29:50.788
Cheating death.
- Immortality?

29:50.790 --> 29:53.157
- Yes.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.959
- Well thanks for sharing.
- It's hard to be on the verge

29:55.961 --> 29:59.163
Of something so exciting and not
share the good news with someone

29:59.165 --> 30:03.066
And you are the perfect person.
- And how's that?

30:03.068 --> 30:05.469
- Well, who would listen to you
if you shared it?

30:05.471 --> 30:10.073
You are insignificant.
You feel how invisible you are.

30:10.075 --> 30:14.611
That's why you did
what you did for me.

30:14.613 --> 30:17.147
Am I right about that?
- Son of a bitch!

30:17.149 --> 30:21.285
You-- you asshole!
Let go of me!

30:21.287 --> 30:24.354
You're the nothing. You.

30:24.356 --> 30:27.291
- We won't see her again.
- Get off me.

30:27.293 --> 30:30.661
- No, sir. You will not.
- Get off me!

30:42.941 --> 30:44.875
- (master): <i>Kelly....</i>

30:44.877 --> 30:47.778
(sniffing)

30:50.548 --> 30:53.050
(sound of heartbeat)

31:06.898 --> 31:09.466
(growling)

31:16.140 --> 31:18.575
<i>Kelly.</i>

31:18.577 --> 31:21.378
<i>Come to me.</i>

31:32.390 --> 31:36.560
<i>Come to me.</i>

31:43.501 --> 31:46.837
(angry growling)

31:50.742 --> 31:52.976
<i>Come to me, kelly.</i>

32:02.587 --> 32:04.054
(snarling)

32:04.056 --> 32:07.124
<i>Kelly.</i>

32:07.126 --> 32:10.260
<i>Come to me.</i>

32:15.867 --> 32:18.101
<i>Look at me!</i>

32:22.273 --> 32:24.441
Rejoice.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.543
(growling loudly)

32:26.545 --> 32:29.680
Embrace your glorious fate.

32:36.654 --> 32:39.256
- Hey mr. Charming, remind me
to ignore you next time.

32:39.258 --> 32:42.726
- Sure, next time I will.
We'll do it your way.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.595
We'll shout, yell,
shoot our way in.

32:45.597 --> 32:48.398
- Yeah, well I had
a better chance.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.668
- Stop.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.904
Turn around.

33:07.085 --> 33:09.019
Relax.

33:09.021 --> 33:12.089
I'm letting you go.

33:14.759 --> 33:17.694
My employer is... Misguided.

33:17.696 --> 33:20.664
- Misguided is not
the bloody word I would use.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.799
- I don't agree with what
he's doing, so I can hardly

33:22.801 --> 33:25.168
Carry out an order
to kill the people

33:25.170 --> 33:27.871
Who are trying to make it right.

33:27.873 --> 33:31.508
- Won't your friends here
tell on you?

33:31.510 --> 33:34.111
- Their loyalty is to me.

33:34.113 --> 33:38.482
- Then why don't you all join
us? Help us make this right.

33:38.484 --> 33:42.953
- Go. While you have a chance.

33:54.298 --> 33:57.701
- Go.

34:10.381 --> 34:13.483
- Diane?

35:34.765 --> 35:37.000
(growling)

35:50.781 --> 35:52.983
(bang!)

35:52.985 --> 35:56.820
(roaring)
(bang!)

35:58.823 --> 36:01.925
(quiet growling)

36:07.532 --> 36:10.767
(roars)
(bang!)

36:50.308 --> 36:53.777
(crying softly)

37:14.165 --> 37:17.467
(sobbing)

37:34.418 --> 37:37.087
- (nora): The only way to ensure
we're right is go down there.

37:48.466 --> 37:51.768
- It's night. I was worried.

37:55.906 --> 37:58.775
- Nothing.

38:04.382 --> 38:06.883
- Guess we're not the only ones
that struck out, huh?

38:06.885 --> 38:10.120
- No luck with the wife, huh?
- Oh, you're still here?

38:10.122 --> 38:14.124
Who invited you here, exactly?
- Hey!

38:14.126 --> 38:17.961
She's here just like
the rest of us.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.629
Who put you in charge?

38:19.631 --> 38:22.565
- The director of
the centers for disease control

38:22.567 --> 38:24.668
Put me in charge.
- You know what?

38:24.670 --> 38:27.771
I don't need this shit.
If you don't want me,

38:27.773 --> 38:30.640
That's absolutely no problem.
I am gone.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.942
- Hey, hey, hey.
It's not his decision.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.845
Alright? Just ignore him. He
doesn't speak for all of us.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.615
It's too dangerous.

38:38.617 --> 38:42.118
At least just wait
'til morning.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.521
- I would rather take my chances
out there

38:44.523 --> 38:48.992
Than be stuck in here
with you assholes!

38:54.799 --> 38:57.267
- Great.
- You got a better deal

38:57.269 --> 38:59.536
Out there, be my guest.

39:01.539 --> 39:03.940
(footsteps)
- dad?

39:07.011 --> 39:09.546
- Hey, buddy.
- Did you find mom?

39:14.185 --> 39:18.054
- Dr. Goodweather,
nora and I were just about

39:18.056 --> 39:21.858
To go over what we discovered--
- just a minute.

39:41.011 --> 39:43.580
- You... Didn't find her?

39:48.886 --> 39:54.257
- No. Look, I uh...
I did find her phone.

39:54.259 --> 39:59.496
- I guess she lost it.
What does that mean?

40:03.167 --> 40:05.402
- I'm not giving up, zack.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.509
- Maybe this is why
she hasn't called.

40:19.116 --> 40:22.118
- 1230.
- I know it.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.958
- It was the street address
at our place in philly

40:28.960 --> 40:32.128
When I was at medical school.

40:32.130 --> 40:35.698
First place we bought together.

41:12.102 --> 41:14.070
- Keep going!

41:14.072 --> 41:16.506
(laughs)
keep going.

41:21.445 --> 41:23.813
Keep going!
- Come on! Ha! Ha! Ha!

41:25.950 --> 41:29.819
- It's what you wanted, right?
- Mom, seriously?

41:31.489 --> 41:33.289
- Back deck.
- What?

41:33.291 --> 41:35.492
- Check the back deck.

41:41.765 --> 41:43.766
Surprise!

41:43.768 --> 41:48.171
Do you like it?
- I love it!

41:48.173 --> 41:51.474
- <i>I got you good, didn't I?</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>Yeah.</i>

41:51.476 --> 41:54.310
- <i>Happy birthday, z.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Thanks so much.</i>

41:54.312 --> 41:57.714
<i>You're the best mom, ever!</i>
<i>I love the blue.</i>

41:57.716 --> 42:00.049
<i>It's exactly what I wanted--</i>
