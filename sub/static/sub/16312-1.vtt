01:03.640 --> 01:05.880
(Squawks)

01:20.600 --> 01:22.760
It's taking so long.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.320
(Chuckles) Look at yourself, Father.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.680
You'd think
this was your first child.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.240
Tell me, were you this nervous
when I was born?

01:33.320 --> 01:36.800
Well, yes and no.
It was different with your mother.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.040
But with Rachel, we gave up hope.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.960
We were told
she could never have children.

01:42.040 --> 01:45.080
- Father! It's a boy!
- Father.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.320
- Father, it's a boy!
- It's a boy.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.400
(Baby crying)

01:49.480 --> 01:50.560
My boy!

01:50.640 --> 01:52.000
(Crying continues)

01:53.840 --> 01:57.480
Can you believe it?
Rachel had a baby.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.920
I guess it is a miracle.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.800
(Baby coos)

02:08.960 --> 02:11.640
O God, who is the father of us all,

02:11.720 --> 02:16.280
you have blessed me
with a gift beyond all measure.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.520
Within a barren wife,

02:18.600 --> 02:21.560
amid the twilight skies of my life,

02:21.640 --> 02:23.880
you've placed a treasure.

02:23.960 --> 02:28.440
# A brightly shining star
where there was none

02:28.520 --> 02:31.960
# You have granted us a son

02:32.040 --> 02:33.840
(Rachel) # Dreams do come true.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.760
- # Look at you
- (Father) # Joseph

02:35.880 --> 02:38.400
(All) # Our baby brother
(Father) # He is special

02:38.480 --> 02:41.880
# He is one of us,
we'll keep him from harm

02:41.960 --> 02:44.360
# And we will teach him

02:44.440 --> 02:47.040
# I will teach him
all he needs to know

02:47.120 --> 02:49.760
# He'll stand apart from other men

02:49.840 --> 02:52.080
# We'll stand beside him and together

02:52.160 --> 02:57.840
# We will show him
what it means to be a family... #

02:59.280 --> 03:01.280
Ah. Ooh.

03:01.360 --> 03:05.880
# You are a miracle child

03:05.960 --> 03:07.400
# You are the best

03:07.480 --> 03:09.960
# You shine the brightest... #

03:10.040 --> 03:13.720
- (Laughs)
- Joseph.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.840
Come on. Come to Papa.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.920
# Your trails be blessed

03:19.000 --> 03:20.760
# Your trials the lightest

03:20.840 --> 03:22.840
# You were made for better things

03:22.920 --> 03:25.320
# You will share the air of kings

03:25.400 --> 03:29.800
# You were born and fortune smiled

03:29.880 --> 03:34.200
# For you are a miracle child

03:37.080 --> 03:38.920
(Rachel) # The sun will rise

03:39.000 --> 03:41.080
# Within your eyes

03:41.160 --> 03:45.840
# The moon will light your smile

03:45.920 --> 03:50.160
# And Heaven grace your gentle face

03:50.240 --> 03:53.960
- # With power to beguile... #
- Good night, Joseph.

03:54.040 --> 03:57.880
# You will wade through
the river of sorrows

03:58.000 --> 04:00.960
# Warm and dry

04:01.040 --> 04:04.720
(Father) # And angels
will guide your tomorrows

04:04.800 --> 04:07.960
# This I prophesy

04:08.040 --> 04:12.480
(Both) # For you are a miracle child

04:12.560 --> 04:15.240
# You are the best

04:15.320 --> 04:17.760
# You shine the brightest

04:17.839 --> 04:22.840
# Your days will be cloudless
and mild

04:22.960 --> 04:25.160
# Your trails be blessed

04:25.240 --> 04:27.280
# Your trials the lightest

04:27.360 --> 04:30.240
# You were made for better things

04:30.320 --> 04:32.680
# You will share the air of kings

04:32.760 --> 04:36.360
# You were born and fortune smiled

04:36.440 --> 04:42.400
# For you are a miracle child

04:55.160 --> 04:57.520
# Dearest Mother

04:57.600 --> 04:59.640
# Beloved Father

04:59.720 --> 05:04.200
# A coat of colours
bright as butterfly wings

05:04.280 --> 05:06.200
# To remind me

05:06.280 --> 05:08.440
# Things you've told me all my life

05:08.520 --> 05:10.440
# I am special, I am smart

05:10.520 --> 05:12.920
# I am somehow set apart

05:13.000 --> 05:16.600
# Petty rules and limitations
don't apply

05:16.680 --> 05:19.240
# For I

05:19.320 --> 05:22.120
# Am a miracle child

05:22.200 --> 05:24.000
# I can't be harmed

05:24.120 --> 05:26.920
# I'm wrapped in rainbows

05:27.000 --> 05:32.160
# Though fate
can be heartless and vile

05:32.240 --> 05:34.640
# My life's been charmed

05:34.720 --> 05:36.400
# And shall remain so

05:36.480 --> 05:39.200
# I was made for something more

05:39.280 --> 05:42.080
# Not to struggle but to soar

05:42.160 --> 05:46.480
# To my fortune reconciled

05:46.560 --> 05:52.440
# For I am a miracle child

05:52.520 --> 05:55.640
# You won't see me bent over double

05:55.720 --> 05:57.600
# In darkness and rubble

05:57.680 --> 06:01.080
# Where mountains of trouble
are piled

06:01.160 --> 06:03.080
# I was destined to fly

06:03.160 --> 06:07.720
# Watch me light up the sky

06:07.800 --> 06:12.760
# For I am a miracle child #

06:21.920 --> 06:24.120
(Insects chirping)

06:38.040 --> 06:40.000
(Bleating)

06:54.240 --> 06:56.120
(Thunder rumbles)

06:56.240 --> 06:59.080
(Growling)

07:02.000 --> 07:03.880
(Barks)

07:03.960 --> 07:06.960
(Wolves barking)

07:16.840 --> 07:18.680
- (Jingles)
- (Sheep bleating)

07:22.920 --> 07:26.080
- (Whispers) Hey...
- (Growls)

07:26.160 --> 07:28.560
- No! Stop!
- What's wrong?

07:28.640 --> 07:30.840
- What's going on?
- What did he say?

07:30.960 --> 07:33.320
- Oh, it's Joseph.
- It was wolves!

07:33.400 --> 07:36.320
Coming out of the shadows.
I was surrounded.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.840
- They were all around...
- That's it?

07:38.920 --> 07:41.840
- You woke us...for a dream?
- Ooh!

07:41.920 --> 07:44.520
Quiet! You want to scare the sheep?

07:44.600 --> 07:47.400
- The sheep. The ram.
- (Brothers murmuring)

07:47.480 --> 07:50.320
- The wolves killed the ram.
- (Bleats)

07:50.400 --> 07:55.320
It was dead. I... I don't understand.
It all seemed so real.

07:55.400 --> 08:00.480
- Everything is fine, Joseph.
- It's over. Don't worry.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.880
Boys, since you're up,
make yourselves useful.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.880
Get to work before sunup.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.200
(Brothers groan)

08:08.280 --> 08:10.200
Thanks(!)

08:12.400 --> 08:14.520
(Grumbling)

08:14.600 --> 08:17.200
- Joseph, where are you going?
- Um, I...

08:17.280 --> 08:19.760
You have studies.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.240
But, I wanna go with them.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.280
- They have their work and you yours.
- But why?

08:26.360 --> 08:29.560
Because you do.
Because you're a miracle child.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.039
For you things are different.

08:32.159 --> 08:35.600
I don't want to be different.
I want to be like them.

08:35.679 --> 08:39.480
Joseph, God has a plan
and a purpose for you.

08:39.559 --> 08:42.159
- You're not like the rest of us.
- (Sighs)

08:42.240 --> 08:46.880
I've worked this earth all my life,
just as my father and grandfather did

08:46.960 --> 08:49.120
and your brothers will after me.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.120
That won't be your future.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.960
Jacob, even God
rested on the seventh day.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.360
He'll find his future soon enough.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.400
- Let him be with his brothers.
- Please?

09:00.720 --> 09:02.800
(Sighs) Go on.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.000
Thanks.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.240
Be safe!

09:12.320 --> 09:14.360
(Sheep bleating)

09:15.640 --> 09:17.200
(Joseph) Judah! Simeon!

09:18.640 --> 09:21.440
- Hmph! Look who's here.
- The miracle child.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.160
What are you doing?
Don't you have some scrolls to read?

09:25.240 --> 09:27.080
Here, let me do that.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.360
Wait, wait!
You have to be very careful.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.160
- You'll cut your hands on the fur(!)
- Get away!

09:33.240 --> 09:36.640
- (All laughing)
- I... I just want to help.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.160
Thanks to you, we'll have to
work an extra hour today.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.280
You're tired
because you were out all night.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.640
Why, you little sneak...
What do you know?

09:46.720 --> 09:49.640
Everything.
The women and the drinking...

09:49.720 --> 09:52.800
- There's a lot Father doesn't know.
- You wouldn't?

09:52.880 --> 09:54.680
He would, the brat.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.960
- One word and I'll wring your neck.
- Stop it!

09:58.040 --> 10:00.400
We should be happy for his help.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.960
Maybe he can do your work, Simeon.
Somebody should.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.480
(Laughter)

10:05.560 --> 10:08.080
And there is something Joseph can do.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.040
- What's he doing?
- Shh!

10:11.120 --> 10:14.640
While we round up the strays,
can you watch the herd?

10:14.720 --> 10:16.880
- Of course.
- Good.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.600
We'll be back soon. Let's go.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.640
Maybe we should split up.
You go over there.

10:22.720 --> 10:26.240
- I'll go this way.
- (Chuckles) Hey! What are you doing?

10:26.320 --> 10:28.080
(Laughs)

10:28.160 --> 10:30.640
- (Bleats)
- (Laughs)

10:35.680 --> 10:38.200
(Brothers laughing and chattering)

10:43.200 --> 10:46.040
- Whoo-hoo!
- (Shouting)

10:46.120 --> 10:48.360
- Get him.
- You're too heavy.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.400
- (Laughing)
- (Sighs)

10:57.640 --> 10:59.480
(Groans)

10:59.560 --> 11:01.360
- (Bleats)
- What?

11:01.440 --> 11:04.280
Are you making fun of me too?

11:07.320 --> 11:09.280
- (Bleating)
- (Laughs)

11:09.360 --> 11:13.600
- (Bleats)
- Hey! Hey, come back!

11:17.120 --> 11:19.160
- (Growling)
- Huh?

11:19.240 --> 11:21.480
- (Growling)
- (Gasps)

11:24.640 --> 11:26.400
Get away! Get away!

11:26.520 --> 11:29.120
(Bleating)

11:29.200 --> 11:31.520
(Wolves barking)

11:34.040 --> 11:36.560
- Gotcha!
- (Wolves snarling)

11:43.320 --> 11:44.840
(Whimpers)

11:47.640 --> 11:49.720
Back! Back!

11:49.800 --> 11:52.840
- Get away!
- (Growling)

11:57.160 --> 11:58.840
(Sighs)

11:58.920 --> 12:01.960
Joseph, are you hurt?

12:02.080 --> 12:04.560
Father! (Panting)

12:04.640 --> 12:07.440
Your brothers, where are they?

12:07.520 --> 12:10.440
I asked you a question!

12:10.520 --> 12:13.320
They're...they're, uh...

12:13.400 --> 12:15.920
They...they went swimming.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.640
- Swimming?
- (Panting)

12:18.720 --> 12:21.960
- What happened?
- This is how you take charge?

12:22.040 --> 12:25.320
I expect you to watch out for Joseph,
but you abandoned my son!

12:25.400 --> 12:28.040
- My son!
- Aren't we your sons too?

12:28.120 --> 12:30.520
- The ram!
- (Bleats)

12:32.200 --> 12:35.400
- (Jingles)
- (Brother) It's Joseph's dream!

12:35.480 --> 12:39.000
Wolves kill sheep.
It happens all the time.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.160
No! I understand.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.680
God sent you a vision of the future.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.360
Joseph didn't really
see the future, did he?

12:54.560 --> 12:56.520
Let's get back to work.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.800
(Insects chirping)

13:03.680 --> 13:05.880
(Grunts)

13:07.520 --> 13:09.960
(Squawking)

13:41.680 --> 13:43.680
Why do we wash before work?

13:43.760 --> 13:46.040
We don't want the sheep smelling you!

13:46.120 --> 13:48.840
(Laughing) Look who finally woke up.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.440
- Look what the sun brought up.
- Nice of you to join us.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.520
Good morning, Joseph.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.960
Mom, last night I had another dream.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.000
- Oh, another dream!
- Ooh!

13:59.080 --> 14:02.840
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Please, why don't you share it?

14:02.920 --> 14:04.760
Who'd the wolf get this time?

14:04.840 --> 14:07.320
You can laugh, but it was about you.

14:07.400 --> 14:12.120
Oh, please, you must tell us
our future, great Joseph!

14:12.200 --> 14:14.880
- Leave me alone!
- Come on, tell us.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.600
We're dying to hear about it.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.040
We were carrying sheaves of wheat.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.680
I was among you,

14:21.760 --> 14:26.280
but then all of a sudden I was above
you and your wheat bowed to me...

14:26.400 --> 14:29.920
- I wonder what that means.
- Nothing, that's what.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.320
Hey, you asked to hear the dream.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.960
What happened next?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.760
The sky was dark
and all around me were stars

14:36.840 --> 14:41.480
- They were bowing to me too.
- Ooh! Let's all bow down to Joseph!

14:41.560 --> 14:45.560
We can't ignore these dreams.
After all, his last one came true.

14:45.640 --> 14:50.200
Are you saying that Joseph belongs
above all of us, even Judah?

14:50.280 --> 14:54.280
I'm not saying that,
but there could be a message here.

14:54.360 --> 14:58.080
Judah's led the herd for years,
brought in the wheat...

14:58.200 --> 15:01.720
He comes first before any of us -
especially Joseph.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.200
Judah, it's not up to me.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.280
God may be telling us
something of our future.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.720
- Then my work doesn't matter.
- Watch your tongue.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.920
Jacob, Judah, please!

15:13.000 --> 15:16.760
- I've had enough of this.
- Let's go.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.880
(Sighs) Look at
what your dreams have done.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.600
Don't get mad at me.
I didn't ask for them.

15:22.680 --> 15:26.360
- Or this either, brother!
- Half-brother!

15:26.440 --> 15:30.280
Joseph! Boys!
Apologise to each other!

15:30.360 --> 15:32.320
Let me talk to Joseph.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.840
(Jacob) He's just a boy.
You're too harsh on him.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.880
You're always defending him!

15:43.800 --> 15:46.360
(Jacob) His dreams come from God.

15:46.440 --> 15:51.320
Joseph, you need to be
more understanding of your brothers.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.440
Life is harder for them
than it will be for you.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.200
Why do you defend them?
They're not even your sons.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.480
They're no less my sons than you are.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.360
We're family, all of us.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.120
If we break apart,
we have nothing left.

16:11.960 --> 16:16.000
# You've seen the damage words can do

16:16.080 --> 16:20.080
# When full of thoughtless pride

16:21.120 --> 16:25.680
# Now heed the wiser voice in you

16:25.760 --> 16:30.440
# That calls to be your guide

16:31.720 --> 16:35.760
# The flowers reaching for the sun

16:35.840 --> 16:39.320
# Are all uniquely blessed

16:39.400 --> 16:43.240
# But though each is special

16:43.320 --> 16:47.120
# Not a one is better

16:47.200 --> 16:49.800
# Than the rest

16:50.800 --> 16:54.800
# Bloom, bloom, may you know

16:54.880 --> 16:59.360
# The wisdom only time breeds

16:59.440 --> 17:04.280
# There's room, bloom and you'll grow

17:04.359 --> 17:09.400
# To follow where your heart leads

17:09.480 --> 17:13.400
# Bloom and may you bring

17:13.480 --> 17:18.359
# Your colours to the vast bouquet

17:18.440 --> 17:22.520
# There's room, bloom,
learn one thing

17:22.599 --> 17:29.240
# Your gifts are meant to give away #

17:30.800 --> 17:32.760
Thanks, Mom.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.400
Judah! Simeon!

17:49.480 --> 17:51.280
Levi! Reuben!

17:51.360 --> 17:53.240
Where are you?

17:53.320 --> 17:57.960
- (Judah) Joseph couldn't lead sheep.
- (Reuben) But he's our brother.

17:58.040 --> 18:01.280
(Simeon) Half brother.
Judah should take over.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.960
- But...
- Do you want Joseph in charge?

18:04.040 --> 18:07.400
We agree that something
has to be done about Joseph?

18:07.480 --> 18:09.840
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.760
- Hey! The spy is back!
- I wasn't spying!

18:12.840 --> 18:15.600
- Did Father tell you to check on us?
- No!

18:15.720 --> 18:18.280
- I want to...
- Report on us to Father?

18:18.360 --> 18:20.440
- You're his favourite.
- N-no.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.320
You look at scrolls all day
while we sweat.

18:23.400 --> 18:27.120
Why is that? Is it because
we don't have pretty coats?

18:27.200 --> 18:29.960
- I have mine.
- (Grunts) That's my coat!

18:30.040 --> 18:33.280
Step aside.
I'm the new head of the family.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.920
Bow before me,
you sheaves of wheat!

18:36.000 --> 18:38.800
Oh, yes, Master Joseph,
ruler of the world.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.480
Give it back, now!

18:40.560 --> 18:44.240
If you want your coat,
why don't you go get it?

18:44.320 --> 18:47.480
- Levi's got it.
- No, I don't. Judah does.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.400
- Come on!
- I've got it!

18:50.480 --> 18:52.080
(Screams)

18:53.600 --> 18:55.480
(Laughing)

18:55.560 --> 18:58.440
- I've had enough of this game!
- Joseph!

18:58.520 --> 19:00.440
Who says this is a game?

19:02.600 --> 19:06.520
What are you doing? Leave me alone!
No! Stop it!

19:08.120 --> 19:09.480
(Gasps)

19:09.560 --> 19:11.720
Oh! Ohh!

19:15.960 --> 19:17.680
(Coughing)

19:18.760 --> 19:21.120
What do we do now?

19:21.200 --> 19:24.560
Are we just going to leave him there?

19:24.640 --> 19:27.720
- We'll think of something.
- Somebody!

19:27.800 --> 19:32.200
- Just get out of here.
- Maybe he can dream his way out.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.520
Don't leave me here alone!

19:38.600 --> 19:40.880
(Sighs)

19:46.520 --> 19:48.600
(Wolf howling)

19:48.680 --> 19:51.040
(Shivering)

19:57.240 --> 19:58.920
Aah! Aah!

20:08.560 --> 20:10.760
(Whoosh)

20:12.840 --> 20:14.760
I knew you'd come back.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.720
(Grunts)

20:19.920 --> 20:24.320
You think this is funny?
Father won't be laughing when...

20:24.400 --> 20:26.320
- Who are you?
- Get him.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.800
Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Ow!

20:28.880 --> 20:32.880
Let me go! You don't understand.
I'm from the house of Jacob!

20:32.960 --> 20:35.920
- Scrawny, isn't he?
- It's hard to tell.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.920
(Groans)

20:38.000 --> 20:40.880
- Hmm.
- No, no, no, don't take my...

20:40.960 --> 20:43.800
- (Groans)
- Get up!

20:43.880 --> 20:47.440
- (Grunts)
- Looks like he's never worked a day.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.760
- That'll change.
- (Laughing)

20:49.840 --> 20:52.680
My brothers will come for me. Judah!

20:52.800 --> 20:55.960
- Simeon! Levi! Please help me!
- Joseph!

20:56.040 --> 20:58.600
We're right here.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.800
(Sighs) Judah.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.440
I told you they'd come for me.

21:09.480 --> 21:13.000
As agreed, 20 pieces of silver.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.000
J-Judah... Why...?

21:23.880 --> 21:26.680
No! Help me!

21:26.760 --> 21:29.560
Levi, please. Issachar.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.560
Simeon. Stop them.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.400
Judah. Judah, help me, please.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.360
Please!

21:43.200 --> 21:45.800
Judah, please!

21:46.880 --> 21:51.000
Judah, we can't turn back now.
We've gone too far.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.240
- Aah!
- Hut, hut!

21:53.320 --> 21:56.200
- (Brays)
- (Chuckles)

21:56.280 --> 21:58.720
I'm your brother!

21:59.000 --> 22:02.160
I'm your brother!

22:02.240 --> 22:04.840
Half-brother.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.480
- (Slaver) Yah!
- (Saddle jingling)

22:11.640 --> 22:13.560
(Wind whistling)

22:19.640 --> 22:21.480
(Wolf howling)

22:21.600 --> 22:24.400
(Slavers talking)

22:24.480 --> 22:26.640
(Shivers)

22:27.400 --> 22:30.000
(Gasps)

22:43.800 --> 22:46.760
- Where could he have gone?
- Don't worry.

22:46.840 --> 22:49.520
I'm sure he's all right.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.880
The boys will find him.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.200
(Judah) Father.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.880
This is all we found.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.200
(Gasps) Joseph!

23:01.280 --> 23:03.720
- No! Joseph!
- Joseph!

23:03.800 --> 23:06.440
(Gasping)

23:06.520 --> 23:08.920
- Oh, Rachel.
- (Sobbing)

23:10.920 --> 23:13.360
- (Grunts)
- Hey, wake up.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.400
(Laughter)

23:49.760 --> 23:53.720
# Behold the glory
behold the wonder

23:53.800 --> 23:56.320
# What we have made
shall not be torn asunder

23:56.400 --> 23:59.160
# Such vast achievement
stone and papyrus

23:59.240 --> 24:01.960
# Beneath the gaze
of Isis and Osiris

24:02.040 --> 24:05.160
# Land of majesty

24:05.240 --> 24:09.080
# Where the heavens smile

24:09.160 --> 24:12.520
# Jewel of history shining

24:12.600 --> 24:15.840
# By the Nile #

24:20.320 --> 24:22.680
- Exquisite, aren't they?
- Yes.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.560
- Where's the slave market?
- By the docks.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.360
(Camel brays)

24:29.680 --> 24:31.360
# Serve and be silent

24:31.440 --> 24:33.000
# You who are chattel

24:33.080 --> 24:36.000
# We think of you
as little more than cattle

24:36.080 --> 24:39.000
# This is your lot now
and we advise you

24:39.080 --> 24:42.240
# To bow before
whatever master buys you

24:42.320 --> 24:45.600
# Feel the power here

24:45.680 --> 24:48.360
# Power has its price

24:48.440 --> 24:51.520
# Some can live like gods

24:51.600 --> 24:54.280
# Some must sacrifice... #

24:54.360 --> 24:57.240
- What do you have?
- A Canaanite.

24:57.320 --> 25:00.880
# Through the centuries
many backs have bent

25:00.960 --> 25:02.800
# Many dreams are built

25:02.880 --> 25:06.840
- # Many lives are spent #
- Move, slave!

25:06.960 --> 25:08.720
Get in line.

25:08.800 --> 25:12.080
(Trader) Slaves for sale!
Buy this one!

25:12.160 --> 25:15.400
(Buyer) Let's have a look.
Let me see his teeth.

25:15.480 --> 25:18.360
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

25:18.440 --> 25:21.120
He's too skinny.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.800
This is more like it.

25:22.880 --> 25:26.640
The captain of the guard
needs a slave for his household.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.280
I have one he might like.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.760
Thirty pieces? Hmm.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.880
He looks healthy enough.
Lord Potiphar!

25:36.560 --> 25:40.560
- He'll do.
- Looks like we have some work to do.

25:40.640 --> 25:44.800
# Look and be humbled
learn what your place is

25:44.880 --> 25:47.760
# Egyptian slave
no matter what your race is

25:47.840 --> 25:50.720
# This is your future
your life suspended

25:50.800 --> 25:53.760
# And everything
you knew before has ended

25:53.920 --> 25:56.920
# You are Egypt's now

25:57.000 --> 26:00.280
# We have all control

26:00.360 --> 26:02.360
# From your every step

26:02.440 --> 26:06.440
# To your very soul #
- Hold still.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.080
You're done. He's ready for work.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.600
It's not for your face.
It's for the floor.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.480
(Grunting)

26:30.920 --> 26:33.080
Ow!

26:34.640 --> 26:36.200
(Laughter)

26:36.280 --> 26:39.240
- 'Hey, Joseph, you missed a spot.'
- (Laughing)

26:39.320 --> 26:41.720
(Levi) 'Real work's different.'

26:41.800 --> 26:45.800
- 'No more baby soft hands.'
- 'Who bows now, little brother? '

26:45.880 --> 26:48.680
(Brothers laughing)

26:49.880 --> 26:51.440
(Grunting)

26:52.400 --> 26:54.520
- You there.
- (Laughter stops)

26:55.600 --> 26:59.000
Have you cleaned
this entire courtyard yourself?

26:59.080 --> 27:01.800
- Yes.
- (Woman) He's a hard worker.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.280
Hmm.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.960
We could put him
to better use inside?

27:07.040 --> 27:10.680
My wife thinks you should work
for her. What do you say?

27:10.760 --> 27:12.960
I cannot say.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.080
A slave is not his own master.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.040
Well said.

27:18.120 --> 27:22.080
Find him some new clothes.
Then get someone else to finish.

27:34.040 --> 27:37.800
- (Yowling)
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Come on.

27:37.880 --> 27:41.240
- (Yowling)
- Who brought the cat?

27:41.320 --> 27:43.960
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- Stop!

27:44.040 --> 27:46.200
- (Chuckles)
- Come down!

27:46.280 --> 27:49.240
Aunt Zuleika, I'm sorry.
I'll get it down.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.600
- (Miaows)
- Please come down.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.760
Come here. Look at this.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.920
- Oh.
- (Women chuckling)

27:59.000 --> 28:02.200
- Hmm. She seems to like you.
- (Miaows)

28:02.280 --> 28:05.360
- (Chuckles)
- Thank you.

28:05.440 --> 28:08.240
I haven't seen you here before.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.320
- Oh, I'm new.
- Asenath.

28:10.400 --> 28:14.160
Coming, Aunt Zuleika. Goodbye.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.200
(Sighs)

28:17.760 --> 28:20.120
(Horse whinnying)

28:21.680 --> 28:23.760
(Woman) Joseph, come here.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.840
I'm waiting.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.880
I'm coming!

28:30.120 --> 28:32.040
Oh! Sorry, Asenath.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.840
- Oh! (Giggles)
- What?

28:33.920 --> 28:37.200
You don't want my aunt
seeing you like this.

28:37.320 --> 28:39.280
- That's better.
- Thanks.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.400
- (Horse whinnies)
- Slave.

28:41.480 --> 28:44.720
- (Flies buzzing)
- Oh, yes, of course.

28:48.520 --> 28:52.200
- (Galloping hooves)
- Hyah! Hyah!

28:52.280 --> 28:55.160
(Zuleika) What a magnificent animal.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.440
- (Potiphar laughing)
- Slave, I'm in the sun.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.760
(Laughing) Whoa!

29:07.880 --> 29:09.720
- Well?
- You were right.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.600
He's all that you promised.

29:11.680 --> 29:14.640
I haven't seen a finer horse
in all of Egypt.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.360
I'm glad Your Excellency is pleased.

29:17.440 --> 29:21.720
- There is still one small matter.
- Oh, yes. As we agreed.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.720
(Coins jingling)

29:28.160 --> 29:31.240
Forgive me,
but something is not quite right.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.240
Hmm. I thought
I brought the right amount.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.440
You're a busy man.
Anyone can make a mistake.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.640
He's yours.
Pharaoh himself would be jealous.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.920
(Potiphar) Yes, he's a fine horse.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.360
Hmm.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.920
Master, I think you should see this.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.400
Uh... Get away from that.
Don't touch it!

29:56.480 --> 29:58.440
Well, look at that.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.880
Well, i-it's broken.

30:00.960 --> 30:04.240
- Your Excellency, I had no idea.
- Of course not.

30:04.320 --> 30:07.360
You're a busy man.
Anyone can make a mistake.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.880
Yours will cost you your freedom.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.520
Please, keep the stallion as a gift.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.360
No. Take him away.

30:16.400 --> 30:21.000
I have a dozen more horses!
Take them all! Please, anything!

30:21.080 --> 30:23.240
Potiphar, you should keep it.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.840
You said it was
the finest in all Egypt.

30:25.920 --> 30:31.200
Own a horse taken from a thief?
What would that say about me?

30:31.280 --> 30:32.720
You and your honour!

30:33.920 --> 30:37.080
- You've done well. What's your name?
- Joseph.

30:37.160 --> 30:40.440
Joseph. You're an educated slave.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.680
- Where did you learn?
- My father taught me.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.600
Ah. He taught you well.

30:46.680 --> 30:51.680
- What else has your father taught?
- I can read and write Egyptian.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.320
(Man) # A boy looks up

30:54.400 --> 30:57.560
- # And sees a golden gift of chance
- What a mess.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.800
Good luck.

30:59.880 --> 31:02.400
# To prove his worth

31:02.480 --> 31:06.280
# And make the best
of what might seem

31:06.360 --> 31:08.920
# A dire circumstance

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
# Onward and onward
the slow and steady climb

31:13.080 --> 31:15.480
- Master.
- Let's have a look.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.040
# Task upon task that can lift him

31:20.120 --> 31:23.360
- # To the summit over time
- Well done, Joseph.

31:23.440 --> 31:27.280
# You've got to take
whatever road's at your feet

31:27.360 --> 31:31.720
# You've got to make
whatever progress you can

31:31.800 --> 31:35.760
# Although the map you hold
is far from complete

31:35.840 --> 31:40.800
# You've got to take
whatever road's at your feet

31:40.880 --> 31:43.440
(Laughing)

31:46.760 --> 31:49.400
To a good year, and to your friend.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.960
(Both laughing)

31:53.040 --> 31:55.600
(Crickets chirping)

32:12.000 --> 32:13.720
(Sighs)

32:19.600 --> 32:22.160
(Judah) 'My neck is killing me.

32:22.280 --> 32:26.560
- 'It's too early for this.'
- (Brothers grunting and laughing)

32:28.200 --> 32:30.360
(Water sloshing)

32:41.920 --> 32:44.040
- (Jacob) 'Rachel.'
- Joseph.

32:44.120 --> 32:47.080
- Huh?
- Shh!

32:47.160 --> 32:49.280
W-why are you here?

32:49.360 --> 32:51.200
- Is something wrong?
- No.

32:51.280 --> 32:54.800
This land...it's not Egypt.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.360
Is this your home?

32:58.360 --> 33:02.920
- Canaan.
- Please, tell me more about Canaan.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.840
(Sighs)

33:04.920 --> 33:09.120
This is the place where I was born.

33:09.200 --> 33:13.440
These are the sunflowers
my mother planted.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.720
This is my, uh...

33:15.840 --> 33:18.120
- My...
- Family?

33:18.200 --> 33:20.240
You miss them, don't you?

33:20.360 --> 33:22.280
My brothers.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.360
They betrayed me!

33:24.440 --> 33:28.720
- Joseph, we are your family now.
- Huh?

33:28.800 --> 33:30.800
We care for you here.

33:30.880 --> 33:34.120
We... I feel you are special.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.680
What? No.
W-why have you come here tonight?

33:37.760 --> 33:40.360
- To be with you.
- No. This is not right.

33:40.440 --> 33:43.000
- Look at me.
- I won't betray my master.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.040
- I'm talking to you.
- No!

33:45.120 --> 33:49.040
- Wait! I order you to stay.
- No!

33:49.120 --> 33:51.600
Everything you are, you owe to me!

33:51.680 --> 33:52.920
(Panting)

33:53.000 --> 33:54.760
(Zuleika screams)

34:00.720 --> 34:03.400
You stood apart
from the other slaves.

34:03.480 --> 34:07.080
I let you work in my home.
I kept you from hard labour,

34:07.160 --> 34:09.159
and you did well for me.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.239
- Or so I thought.
- Master...

34:11.320 --> 34:15.840
No other slave was ever given this
opportunity! I gave you my trust.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.400
- What do you say?
- I did nothing wrong.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.080
Still you insult me
with your denials!

34:21.159 --> 34:24.040
- What am I to make of this?
- (Sobbing)

34:25.199 --> 34:28.840
It's not what it seems.
I could never betray you, master.

34:28.920 --> 34:32.760
Such insolence! Am I to believe
a slave over my own wife?

34:32.840 --> 34:35.440
I swear. I did nothing to betray you.

34:35.520 --> 34:41.520
Silence! For what you have done,
you must be put to death.

34:41.639 --> 34:45.040
- See to it.
- No, Master, I beg you. Tell him!

34:45.120 --> 34:48.840
Help me! Tell him that... (Groaning)

34:48.920 --> 34:51.480
Help me! Please!

34:51.560 --> 34:56.760
- Stop. He doesn't deserve to die.
- Why?

35:01.680 --> 35:03.600
I see.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.400
Take him to prison.

35:08.480 --> 35:13.280
Wait, master. No! Please!
Believe me! I- I did nothing wrong!

35:27.320 --> 35:29.440
This is a mistake! Uh!

35:31.840 --> 35:33.800
I did nothing wrong.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.560
Yeah, we know you're innocent.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.160
(Squeaking)

35:58.920 --> 36:02.520
I know it sounds crazy,
but it was so real.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.040
I was up all night
with my own dreams.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.600
Now you wanna take up
my day with yours?

36:08.680 --> 36:11.640
No. Just listen.
I was back at Pharaoh's palace

36:11.720 --> 36:15.760
in a garden of grapes
that had three old vines.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.520
A tear fell from my eye,
and the vines drank it in.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.960
They became so thick with grapes...

36:22.040 --> 36:25.920
that I squeezed them into a cup
and served it to Pharaoh.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.600
That is quite a dream.

36:29.680 --> 36:34.440
- I know what your dream means.
- You do? H-how could you?

36:34.520 --> 36:37.760
I just do. It's some kind of gift.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.520
The three vines signify three days.

36:40.600 --> 36:44.480
Then Pharaoh will bring
you back to the palace a free man.

36:44.560 --> 36:48.040
- (Sighs) If only it were true.
- It is true.

36:48.120 --> 36:52.200
And when you're free, tell Pharaoh
about my gift. Please.

36:52.280 --> 36:56.720
Some gift. To make up fairy tales
and give hope to the foolish.

36:56.800 --> 37:00.360
- Maybe he's not making it up.
- All right, then.

37:00.440 --> 37:03.280
Here's one I've had every night
for a week.

37:03.360 --> 37:09.080
I'm taking three baskets of bread
to Pharaoh when the baskets fall.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.000
I go to pick up the bread,

37:11.080 --> 37:14.240
when suddenly
a swarm of birds attack me.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.600
They keep pecking at me
in the face and the eyes.

37:17.680 --> 37:20.080
What does it mean?

37:20.200 --> 37:22.640
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. Tell me.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.360
Tell me!

37:27.280 --> 37:30.800
(Sighs) The three baskets
also signify three days.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.920
In three days,
Pharaoh will behead you,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.680
and birds will feed on your flesh.

37:36.760 --> 37:40.000
What? You're lying. You're lying!

37:40.080 --> 37:42.800
- Stop it!
- Uhh! No!

37:43.800 --> 37:47.680
Don't pay any attention to him.
We're not going anywhere.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.120
(Squeaking)

38:06.000 --> 38:07.600
(Door opens)

38:09.600 --> 38:11.440
Take him.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.480
Get up.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.520
You knew. You knew!
That's not a gift!

38:19.600 --> 38:23.200
- That's a curse!
- Pharaoh has summoned you.

38:23.280 --> 38:27.600
- Why? What did I do?
- Let's go.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.880
It's gonna be all right. You'll see.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.120
- Tell Pharaoh about me.
- I will.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.600
Don't forget me!

38:39.560 --> 38:41.360
Don't forget me!

38:54.440 --> 38:58.400
Guard! Tell them I'm still here!

38:58.480 --> 39:00.200
Answer me!

39:00.280 --> 39:01.840
(Sighs)

39:01.920 --> 39:03.800
No one cares.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.640
(Rain falling)

39:26.560 --> 39:27.760
Asenath!

39:27.840 --> 39:31.040
(Guard) Halt! Who's there?

39:31.840 --> 39:33.440
No!

39:34.440 --> 39:38.360
- (Thunder)
- (Squeaking)

39:38.440 --> 39:40.840
(Roars)

39:44.520 --> 39:46.640
(Spitting and panting)

39:46.720 --> 39:50.600
God, why are you doing this to me?

39:50.680 --> 39:53.640
Do you hear me?

39:53.720 --> 39:55.960
Any kindness, you take away.

39:56.040 --> 39:59.640
You gave me the dreams.
You brought me the gift!

39:59.720 --> 40:04.480
Some gift! My dreams are lies.
What have I done to deserve this?

40:08.400 --> 40:10.360
(Thunder)

40:42.480 --> 40:46.760
# I thought I did what's right

40:46.840 --> 40:50.960
# I thought I had the answers

40:51.040 --> 40:55.440
# I thought I chose the surest road

40:55.520 --> 40:59.600
# But that road brought me here

41:00.600 --> 41:04.080
# So I put up a fight

41:05.200 --> 41:09.360
# And told you how to help me

41:09.440 --> 41:13.680
# Now, just when I have given up

41:13.760 --> 41:17.880
# The truth is coming clear

41:19.400 --> 41:22.600
# You know

41:22.680 --> 41:26.400
# Better than I

41:26.480 --> 41:29.360
# You know

41:29.440 --> 41:32.840
# The way

41:32.920 --> 41:36.800
# I've let go

41:36.880 --> 41:39.600
# The need to know why

41:39.680 --> 41:43.560
# For you know better

41:43.640 --> 41:46.400
# Than I

41:48.000 --> 41:51.360
# If this has been a test

41:51.440 --> 41:54.240
# I cannot see the reason

41:54.320 --> 41:57.840
# But maybe knowing "I don't know"

41:57.920 --> 42:01.440
# Is part of getting through

42:02.640 --> 42:05.840
# I try to do what's best

42:05.920 --> 42:09.120
# And faith has made it easy

42:09.200 --> 42:13.360
# To see the best thing I can do

42:13.440 --> 42:16.320
# Is put my trust in you

42:16.400 --> 42:20.400
# For you know

42:20.480 --> 42:23.960
# Better than I

42:24.040 --> 42:26.920
# You know

42:27.000 --> 42:29.760
# The way

42:29.840 --> 42:34.520
# I've let go

42:34.600 --> 42:37.720
# The need to know why

42:37.800 --> 42:41.160
# For you know better

42:41.240 --> 42:45.640
# Than I

42:45.720 --> 42:50.840
# I saw one cloud
and thought it was the sky

42:51.920 --> 42:54.840
# I saw a bird and thought

42:54.920 --> 42:58.520
# That I could follow

42:58.600 --> 43:01.840
# But it was you
who taught that bird

43:01.920 --> 43:04.440
# To fly

43:04.520 --> 43:07.800
# If I let you reach me

43:07.880 --> 43:10.440
# Will you teach me

43:10.520 --> 43:14.600
# For you know

43:14.680 --> 43:18.560
# Better than I

43:18.640 --> 43:23.960
# You know the way

43:24.040 --> 43:28.200
# I've let go

43:28.280 --> 43:31.120
# The need to know why

43:31.200 --> 43:34.960
# I'll take what answers

43:35.040 --> 43:38.760
# You supply

43:40.680 --> 43:43.240
# You know better

43:43.320 --> 43:48.120
# Than I #

44:05.680 --> 44:07.480
(Sighs)

44:19.000 --> 44:21.520
Potiphar?

44:24.600 --> 44:27.920
Pharaoh's butler
said you interpret dreams.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.280
That is true. And?

44:30.360 --> 44:35.760
Pharaoh is tortured by a dream.
None of his wise men can explain it.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.680
I'm to bring you to the palace.

44:40.240 --> 44:42.040
Potiphar?

44:43.360 --> 44:46.560
It's good to see you again.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.920
How could I
have allowed this to happen?

44:54.000 --> 44:57.080
- My wife...
- I understand.

44:58.440 --> 45:00.520
Let's go.

45:21.680 --> 45:26.000
For the sake of Egypt,
relieve my suffering.

45:27.080 --> 45:28.600
(Groans)

45:49.000 --> 45:52.680
- Is this the one you spoke of?
- Yes, Excellency.

45:55.280 --> 45:59.800
I'm told you merely need to hear
a dream and you can explain it.

45:59.880 --> 46:03.880
Not me, Your Excellency.
The explanation comes from God.

46:03.960 --> 46:09.400
None of my wise men or magicians,
none of my gods could help me.

46:09.480 --> 46:13.240
What makes you think
your god is any different?

46:19.480 --> 46:21.480
Tell me your dream, Pharaoh.

46:23.880 --> 46:26.640
Every night it's the same.

46:28.600 --> 46:32.120
I am standing by the Nile.

46:32.240 --> 46:35.400
Seven healthy cows
graze peacefully on the banks.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.760
(Thunderclap)

46:42.400 --> 46:47.440
But then seven horrible,
sickly cows come from the same river,

46:47.520 --> 46:51.000
the most wretched
I have ever seen in Egypt.

46:52.240 --> 46:55.800
Suddenly they begin to devour
the healthy cattle,

46:55.880 --> 46:58.800
and yet the cows remain
as sickly as before.

47:00.200 --> 47:02.200
And then I wake up.

47:03.400 --> 47:07.800
- Is there more?
- Yes. Another dream always follows.

47:07.880 --> 47:12.520
Seven ears of grain, full and golden,
grow from a single stalk.

47:16.600 --> 47:19.040
(Rumbling)

47:19.120 --> 47:22.360
Suddenly, seven ears,
hardened and scorched,

47:22.440 --> 47:24.600
spring up on the same stalk...

47:26.960 --> 47:29.000
and swallow the seven good ears.

47:30.800 --> 47:34.760
All that remains
are shrivelled grains unfit to eat...

47:35.920 --> 47:37.920
and nothing else.

47:40.600 --> 47:42.320
Well?

47:42.400 --> 47:44.440
Pharaoh's dreams are one.

47:44.520 --> 47:50.040
The healthy cows and ears of grain
are seven years of abundance.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.360
The sickly cows
and the withered grain...

47:55.440 --> 47:58.080
mean seven years of famine
will follow...

47:58.160 --> 48:00.160
and destroy the land.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.040
Egypt may not survive.

48:05.720 --> 48:09.120
Can this be stopped?
What can be done?

48:09.200 --> 48:11.400
You must find a man you can trust.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.480
During the years of plenty,

48:13.560 --> 48:17.360
have him collect one-fifth
of the grain from every field

48:17.440 --> 48:19.200
and store it under guard.

48:19.280 --> 48:23.000
Then, during the famine,
give it back to the people.

48:23.080 --> 48:25.960
Potiphar, you trust this man?

48:27.560 --> 48:29.520
With my life, Excellency.

48:31.320 --> 48:34.280
(Crowd cheering)

48:37.040 --> 48:38.800
(Crowd silences)

48:38.880 --> 48:42.200
Through this man,
I have seen the future of Egypt.

48:44.240 --> 48:47.840
And through his deeds,
we shall prosper.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.800
(Crowd cheers)

48:52.160 --> 48:55.240
I am giving him power over all Egypt.

48:55.320 --> 48:57.920
Only Pharaoh will be greater.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.440
You shall call him Tzafenat Paneah.

49:01.520 --> 49:04.480
The God speaks and He lives.

49:06.200 --> 49:09.840
(Crowd cheering)
Tzafenat Paneah! Tzafenat Paneah!

49:23.440 --> 49:25.880
- (Miaows)
- Hey.

49:25.960 --> 49:29.480
Kia, come back here. Hmm.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.360
(Joseph clears throat)

49:32.440 --> 49:33.640
(Gasps)

49:33.720 --> 49:36.120
Tzafenat Paneah.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.760
Joseph.

49:59.560 --> 50:02.320
(Cheering)

50:20.560 --> 50:22.760
# A single voice

50:22.840 --> 50:25.800
# Is joined by multitudes in song

50:28.120 --> 50:30.560
# With every verse

50:30.680 --> 50:34.760
# They're finding harmonies
that rise to Heaven

50:34.840 --> 50:37.160
- # Sure and strong
- (Asenath) Hey.

50:37.240 --> 50:39.360
- We've come to help.
- # Richer and richer

50:39.440 --> 50:43.280
- # The soil on which they thrive
- Great.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.440
# Higher and higher

50:47.520 --> 50:51.360
# A hymn of what it means to be alive

50:51.440 --> 50:55.240
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

50:55.320 --> 50:59.240
# You've got to leave
a little more than was here

50:59.320 --> 51:02.600
# You may be prideful
of the strides you will make

51:02.680 --> 51:06.600
# But keep one thing clear

51:06.680 --> 51:10.880
# You're just a player
in a much bigger plan

51:10.960 --> 51:14.960
# And still you have
to give it all that you can

51:15.040 --> 51:18.680
# The very measure
of your soul is at stake

51:18.760 --> 51:23.960
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

51:27.000 --> 51:29.400
(Woman) # The seasons fly

51:29.480 --> 51:33.560
# A man stands where a boy once stood

51:35.160 --> 51:37.360
# His path unfolds

51:37.440 --> 51:41.080
# And unafraid he walks in service

51:41.160 --> 51:43.960
# Of a greater good

51:44.040 --> 51:49.640
(Both) # Deeper and deeper
the lessons he has known

51:51.840 --> 51:53.720
# Over and over

51:53.800 --> 51:58.160
# The message
he is surely being shown

51:58.240 --> 52:02.120
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

52:02.200 --> 52:06.160
# You've got to leave
a little more than was here

52:06.240 --> 52:10.000
# You may be prideful
of the strides you will make

52:10.080 --> 52:12.960
# But keep one thing clear

52:13.040 --> 52:17.560
# You're just a player
in a much bigger plan

52:17.640 --> 52:21.680
# And still you have
to give it all that you can

52:21.760 --> 52:25.560
# The very measure
of your soul is at stake

52:25.640 --> 52:30.280
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

52:33.200 --> 52:37.480
# The very measure
of your soul is at stake

52:37.560 --> 52:43.000
# You've got to give
a little more than you take #

53:06.640 --> 53:09.480
(Wind whistles)

53:26.720 --> 53:28.840
(Cawing)

53:33.000 --> 53:35.200
(Straining)

53:46.880 --> 53:50.080
Next. How many in your family?

53:50.160 --> 53:52.400
- Five.
- Five.

53:52.480 --> 53:54.440
Thank you, my lord.

53:56.120 --> 53:58.000
(Potiphar) Next, please.

53:58.080 --> 54:00.960
- A long life for you, Excellency.
- And for you.

54:01.800 --> 54:04.960
Ah, here's a responsible young man.

54:05.040 --> 54:07.280
- How many in your family?
- Four, my lord.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.200
Very good.

54:13.760 --> 54:16.400
- Hi there. What's your name?
- Menna.

54:16.480 --> 54:20.960
And this is my sister Nyla.
I'm looking after her.

54:21.040 --> 54:24.520
- Are you here for some grain too?
- (Gasps)

54:25.440 --> 54:27.800
(Laughs)

54:27.920 --> 54:30.800
- Thank you!
- Bye!

54:30.920 --> 54:33.360
(Cries out)

54:34.960 --> 54:39.160
- Here you go.
- (Potiphar) Who's next?

54:39.240 --> 54:41.720
We are, my lord.

54:42.960 --> 54:46.040
- You are not Egyptian.
- No, sir.

54:46.120 --> 54:49.280
My brothers and I
have travelled far, from Canaan.

54:55.920 --> 54:59.040
- Joseph, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

54:59.120 --> 55:01.560
Look at you. You're shaking.

55:01.640 --> 55:03.920
I-it must be the sun. I'll be fine.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.280
(Judah) Our families are hungry.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.240
You haven't contributed
to our supply.

55:09.320 --> 55:12.760
We don't ask for charity.
We'll pay you with silver.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.800
(Potiphar) How many are there?

55:18.880 --> 55:23.360
12. 10 here and at home we have
our father and youngest brother.

55:23.440 --> 55:25.480
- (Gasps)
- (Potiphar) Give them...

55:25.560 --> 55:27.560
(Joseph) Nothing!

55:27.640 --> 55:32.160
10 foreigners asking
for grain, no ties to Egypt.

55:32.240 --> 55:35.920
Are you thieves, hoping to see
where we store our grain?

55:36.000 --> 55:39.760
I don't know what you are,
but I don't believe your story.

55:39.840 --> 55:42.880
Your Excellency,
everything we say is true.

55:42.960 --> 55:45.960
Prove it!
Produce this youngest brother.

55:46.040 --> 55:49.520
- But what would that prove?
- That you're not lying.

55:49.600 --> 55:52.400
If it's the truth,
I'll let you buy grain.

55:52.480 --> 55:56.000
Till then, arrest this one!

55:56.080 --> 55:59.080
- (Gasps)
- Until you produce this brother.

55:59.160 --> 56:01.360
- Take him.
- (Grunting)

56:01.440 --> 56:03.360
- (All shouting)
- Stop!

56:03.440 --> 56:07.080
- Judah, help me!
- (Guard) No!

56:07.160 --> 56:10.040
- (Simeon) No! No! No!
- (Guard) Let's go.

56:10.120 --> 56:12.080
(Door slams)

56:16.760 --> 56:19.720
Joseph, what are you doing?

56:19.800 --> 56:22.080
They're only feeding their families.

56:22.160 --> 56:25.880
They're thieves,
here to steal our grain.

56:25.960 --> 56:28.320
They needed food and they would pay.

56:28.400 --> 56:32.240
How can you say they're thieves?
They've done nothing to you.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.360
(Scoffs)

56:34.560 --> 56:36.640
Nothing?

56:38.320 --> 56:40.120
(Sighs)

56:41.240 --> 56:44.400
- They're my brothers.
- What?

56:44.480 --> 56:49.800
They sold me.
They sold me into slavery.

56:49.880 --> 56:52.320
They took me away from my home.

56:52.400 --> 56:55.120
I never got
to say goodbye to my mother.

56:55.200 --> 56:58.560
I never got
to see my father grow old.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.960
Joseph, I... I didn't know.

57:05.040 --> 57:09.600
You're here now. You have a home,
a wife who loves you,

57:09.680 --> 57:12.240
everything you could want.

57:12.320 --> 57:14.840
No. Not everything.

57:18.720 --> 57:21.920
I thought you learned something
in that cell.

57:22.800 --> 57:25.600
Remember when
I would bring food to you?

57:25.680 --> 57:29.440
Yes. It kept me going.

57:36.880 --> 57:39.840
(Simeon) Hey! You won't keep me here.

57:39.920 --> 57:42.080
My brothers will come for me.

57:42.160 --> 57:44.600
(Echoing) My brothers will come...

57:46.920 --> 57:48.320
Joseph.

57:52.400 --> 57:56.600
# How long must there be anger here

57:56.680 --> 58:00.000
# Before we can rejoice

58:00.080 --> 58:04.000
# Embracing love instead of fear

58:04.080 --> 58:07.760
# Is but a simple choice

58:09.040 --> 58:12.400
# It's hard for me to see you fall

58:12.480 --> 58:16.120
# So bitter and so blind

58:16.200 --> 58:20.920
# When the truest nature of us all

58:21.000 --> 58:24.920
# Invites us to be kind

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
# Bloom, bloom, may you know

58:29.080 --> 58:32.920
# The wisdom only time breeds

58:33.000 --> 58:36.920
# There's room, bloom and you'll grow

58:37.000 --> 58:41.720
# To follow where your heart leads

58:41.800 --> 58:45.360
# Bloom and may you live

58:45.440 --> 58:49.640
# The way your life was meant to be

58:49.720 --> 58:52.240
# There's room,
bloom and forgive... #

58:52.320 --> 58:53.920
Tzafenat Paneah...

58:54.000 --> 58:57.160
The family of Canaanites...
They've returned.

58:57.240 --> 58:58.880
Thank you.

58:59.560 --> 59:03.080
Maybe they've suffered
these last 20 years as well.

59:03.160 --> 59:05.200
- Maybe they've changed.
- No.

59:05.280 --> 59:07.280
I don't think so.

59:07.360 --> 59:09.600
(Door closes)

59:10.720 --> 59:13.800
(Murmuring)

59:13.880 --> 59:16.120
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.

59:19.280 --> 59:22.040
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

59:33.520 --> 59:35.520
Welcome.

59:35.600 --> 59:40.320
- You've done what I've asked?
- Our brother, Benjamin.

59:51.040 --> 59:55.040
You kept your word.
Bring out the other brother.

59:55.120 --> 01:00:00.480
So, Benjamin,
tell me of your mother and father.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.120
My mother is no longer alive.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.040
Oh. I- I'm sorry.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.360
And your father?

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.520
- He's worried I'm here.
- Why is that?

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:19.920
- I'm a long way from home.
- Oh? Doesn't he trust your brothers?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.480
He likes me to stay close by.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.320
Really? Why is that?

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.000
A long time ago,
h-he lost his youngest son.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.360
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.000
- He was killed.
- Killed? How?

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.880
By wolves.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.840
- Wolves?
- Yes.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.560
It broke my father's heart.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.800
Well, it must have been very hard
on your brothers too.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.040
- They never speak of it.
- Don't they?

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.160
- Benjamin!
- (Brothers) Simeon!

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.480
- I was beginning to worry.
- (All murmuring)

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.920
You must be hungry
after your journey. Come.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.840
You'll be my guests.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.640
(Traditional music)

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.200
- A toast...
- (Music stops)

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.960
to brothers.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.760
(All) To brothers!

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.640
(Music resumes)

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.560
(Brothers arguing and protesting)

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.160
Stop this. You have no right.
We've done nothing wrong.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.640
What's going on?
Why have they been arrested?

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.640
- Joseph, what are you doing?
- You'll see.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.440
Get back in place. Get back in...

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.680
I give you food.
I take you into my home.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.560
And this is how you repay me,
by stealing?

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.520
We wouldn't steal from you!

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.240
- And now you insult me by lying.
- What?

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.320
One of you has stolen from me.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.000
Benjamin.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.640
- (Murmuring) No...
- The favoured one.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.480
- I didn't!
- Arrest him.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.360
For this you will be punished.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.680
- Someone put it there!
- Stop! Take me instead.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.680
- No, take me.
- Take me!

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.680
- (All) Take me!
- Take any of us, your grace,

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.120
but, please, let the boy go.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.800
You would sacrifice yourselves
for a spoiled half-brother?

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.240
Yes.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.960
Why should you care if I take him,
beat him, make him a slave?

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.080
Because I will not
make my father suffer...again.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.360
Again? What do you mean, "again"?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.800
Our brother was not killed by wolves.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.960
We were blinded by jealousy
and sold him into slavery.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.080
For 20 years
we have lived with that guilt.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.880
We can't go back without the boy.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.720
My father could not bear it
a second time.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.360
And neither could we.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.120
If anyone is to be punished,
it should be us.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.880
(Sighs)

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.440
I will not harm any of you
or our father.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.920
I am your brother, Joseph.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.480
- Joseph?
- I can't believe you're here.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.000
How can it be?

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.440
Joseph?

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.040
I have so much to tell you,
so many questions to ask.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.000
Oh, Joseph, can you ever forgive us?

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.320
I already have.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.960
Can you forgive me for thinking
I was some miracle from God?

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.080
But you are a miracle.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.480
God sent you to save our family
and all of Egypt.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.600
- And you did.
- Asenath?

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.200
Please. I'd like you
to meet my brothers.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.920
(All) Welcome. Pleasure to meet you.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.840
You will join me here,

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.880
all of you, with your families.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.040
Look!

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.400
- I see him! There he is!
- It's him! There he is!

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.200
- Joseph!
- Father.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.320
Father! Father!

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.960
- Father!
- Joseph.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.520
My boy. My boy.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.000
Your mother prayed
this day would come,

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.160
that we'd all be together again
as a family.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.400
- It's a miracle.
- Yes, Father. It is a miracle.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.160
# Oh, you know

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.920
# Better than I

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.560
# You know

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.560
# The way

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.520
# I've let go

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.680
# The need to know why

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.640
# I'll take what answers

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.960
# You supply

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:46.000
# You know better than I #

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.240
(Man) # A single voice

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:53.160
# Is joined by multitudes in song

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.080
# With every verse

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.479
# They're finding harmonies

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:04.200
# That rise to Heaven sure and strong

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:09.399
# Richer and richer,
the soil on which they thrive

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.800
# Higher and higher

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.880
# A hymn of what it means
to be alive

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.160
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.040
# You've got to leave
a little more than was here

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.960
# You may be prideful
of the strides you will make

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.600
# But keep one thing clear

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.920
# You're just a player
in a much bigger plan

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.880
# And still you have
to give it all that you can

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.800
# The very measure of your soul
is at stake

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:50.720
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.680
(Woman) # The seasons fly

01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.760
# A man stands where a boy once stood

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.280
# His path unfolds

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.960
# And unafraid he walks in service

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.680
# Of a greater good

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:16.160
(Both) # Deeper and deeper
the lessons he has known

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.800
# Over and over

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.880
# The message
he is surely being shown

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.880
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:32.720
# You've got to leave
a little more than was here

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.960
# You may be prideful
of the strides you will make

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.160
# But keep one thing clear

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:44.760
# You're just a player
in a much bigger plan

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.640
# And still you have
to give it all that you can

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.600
# The very measure of your soul
is at stake

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:58.080
# You've got to give
a little more than you take

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.120
# The very measure of your soul
is at stake

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:10.040
# You've got to give
a little more than you take #
