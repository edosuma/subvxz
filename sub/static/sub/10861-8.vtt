WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.840
Why do we always tell 
 scary stories at night?

00:06.560 --> 00:11.280
I mean, if they're scary, 
 they should be just as scary

00:11.280 --> 00:14.200
- during the day, right? 
 - No way.

00:14.200 --> 00:17.080
Things are always scarier at night.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.640
Yeah, but why?

00:19.640 --> 00:22.640
Because you can't 
 see things at night.

00:22.640 --> 00:26.000
Yeah, like some ghoul could 
 sneak up on you in the dark

00:26.000 --> 00:28.600
and you wouldn't know 
 until it was too late.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.920
Yeah.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.080
- I am. 
 - Oh, man.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.360
What's the matter?

00:34.360 --> 00:36.880
You always tell 
 the same kind of story.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.240
It's kind of gross,

00:38.240 --> 00:40.720
but everyone always 
 lives happily ever after.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.400
- Boring. 
 - So what's your problem?

00:43.400 --> 00:45.400
You're kind of gross 
 and boring too.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.480
- You, Kiki. 
 - Good one.

00:47.480 --> 00:53.400
Things are scarier at night, 
 especially in my story.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.760
You can be scared during 
 the day, but don't bother,

00:56.760 --> 01:01.320
because the real terror 
 never begins until night falls.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.520
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:07.520 --> 01:09.760
except for Eric...

01:10.320 --> 01:13.200
I call this story...

[screaming]

01:42.000 --> 01:44.560
- Boo! 
 - Aaaaagggghhhhh!

01:44.560 --> 01:46.000
[giggling]

01:46.000 --> 01:48.200
What's the matter, 
 did I scare you?

01:48.520 --> 01:50.400
Not too funny.

01:51.920 --> 01:57.160
You sit in front of the TV all day, 
 and you're gonna turn into dad.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.600
Great. If that happens,

01:58.600 --> 02:01.680
I'll send you to your room-- 
 forever.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.600
You're a zero. 
 You'll always be a zero.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.320
You won't catch me 
 sitting around like some toad.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.840
There's a ton going on 
 in the world, Dayday,

02:11.840 --> 02:14.840
and I'm not going to miss any of it.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.720
Hey, new neighbors moving in.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.000
At night?

02:25.640 --> 02:30.080
- What's with the black clothes? 
 - I think they look cool.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.720
Maybe they're artists 
 or foreign diplomats.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.720
Or maybe they got 
 dressed in the dark

02:34.720 --> 02:36.440
and don't know they look stupid.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.800
Whoever they are,

02:37.800 --> 02:40.240
they don't fit this 
 boring neighborhood.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.760
[Both] 
 Whoa.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.520
Tell me that wasn't creepy.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.440
I think I'm going to 
 avoid our new neighbors.

03:03.040 --> 03:06.200
- Need a hand? 
 - I need a new back.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.600
What's in the box?

03:07.600 --> 03:10.400
Whatever it is, 
 they got 2 of 'em.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.680
Know these people?

03:18.680 --> 03:20.560
No. 
 They just moved in Friday night.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.280
We're coming over to say hi.

03:22.280 --> 03:25.680
- What's their name? 
 - Um, Braun-- Mr. and Mrs.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.960
Look at this.

03:27.960 --> 03:33.480
Ravno, Ukraine. 
 They're from the Ukraine.

03:33.480 --> 03:37.120
- That near Disneyworld? 
 - No, Dip, it's never Russia.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.400
I knew that.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.280
Must have wanted these 
 refrigerators pretty bad.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.040
They ordered them in Russia.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.120
That's what they are? 
 Refrigerators?

03:44.120 --> 03:45.920
Mm-hmm.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.800
You just gonna leave 'em?

03:50.800 --> 03:52.680
Yep. 
 That's what the order says.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.120
Nobody home, 
 leave 'em in the driveway.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.680
See you.

03:57.560 --> 03:58.800
Come on.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.480
- That's weird. 
 - What?

04:01.480 --> 04:04.120
Their car's here. 
 They gotta be home.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.400
Why didn't they 
 answer the door?

04:10.960 --> 04:12.520
What if they're KGB agents

04:12.520 --> 04:15.360
who had to bolt when 
 the Soviet Union crumbled?

04:15.360 --> 04:17.200
Or gypsies searching 
 for a new home?

04:17.200 --> 04:18.640
Oh, get real.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.839
Hi, Mom.

04:21.839 --> 04:24.160
I'm late. Don't forget 
 to tell your father--

04:24.160 --> 04:26.840
Oh! 
 I'm sorry.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.200
I'm late. Bye.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.520
Sorry, Mr. Mitchell.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.280
When Mom's in a rush, 
 she's a little crazy.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.640
Oh, it's OK.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.360
- I know the feeling. 
 - Are you OK?

04:42.360 --> 04:45.120
Yeah. I just got a touch 
 of something.

04:45.120 --> 04:48.080
I'm as weak as a kitten.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.280
Well, the mail must go through.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.560
Uh, have you met 
 the new neighbors yet?

04:53.560 --> 04:54.960
Oh, yeah.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.760
They stopped by my house 
 the other night

04:57.760 --> 05:00.560
just to get acquainted. 
 That's the night I'll never forget.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.760
Why, were they strange 
 or something?

05:02.760 --> 05:05.440
No, it's the night 
 I started getting sick.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.640
I hope I can shake it off.

05:13.120 --> 05:16.640
Emma started paying close 
 attention to the Brauns.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.840
She watched them 
 every chance she got.

05:19.840 --> 05:23.920
And the more she watched, 
 the more she realized

05:23.920 --> 05:29.120
the new neighbors were just 
 a little bit strange.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.760
They didn't talk to anyone,

05:31.760 --> 05:36.520
and no one ever saw them 
 during the day, only at night.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.560
Even their kid, Lex, 
 was never seen during the day.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.440
- Hello. 
 - [gasps]

05:48.720 --> 05:51.400
Can I come in and play?

05:51.400 --> 05:55.360
- Um, it's kind of late. 
 - Maybe some other time.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.160
Lex never started school.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.160
No one had even heard of him.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.840
And the strange disease 
 that hit Mr. Mitchell

06:08.840 --> 06:12.360
was spreading through 
 the neighborhood like crazy.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.120
People were losing their energy.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.760
It was like an epidemic 
 going around,

06:21.760 --> 06:24.200
but no one knew what it was,

06:24.200 --> 06:27.640
and it started the same night 
 the Brauns moved in.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.320
Things seemed very strange indeed.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.240
Emma had a great imagination,

06:36.240 --> 06:41.240
but this was a little weird, 
 even for her.

06:41.240 --> 06:46.440
Then one night, all the pieces 
 of the puzle came together.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.000
Aaaaagggggghhhhhhh!

07:24.160 --> 07:26.000
Wake up, Dayday. 
 Come on.

07:26.240 --> 07:30.240
I can't go to school, Mom. 
 I'm sick.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.520
Get up now.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.280
What? What?

07:37.280 --> 07:39.160
Give me that.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.920
I know what's wrong 
 with the Brauns.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.080
Me too. 
 They have a crazy neighbor-- you.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.120
Listen, why is it they're 
 never out during the day?

07:47.120 --> 07:50.240
And where are they from?

07:50.240 --> 07:52.880
Here. Ravno, Ukraine.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.640
That's right in the middle 
 of all those e-ah places--

07:55.640 --> 08:00.000
Rumania, Bulgaria, 
 Transylvania?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.480
And what about those people?

08:01.480 --> 08:04.800
They're all getting sick-- 
 weak and pale--

08:04.800 --> 08:07.360
and they all have band-aids 
 on their necks.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.600
- There's only one explanation. 
 - What?

08:09.600 --> 08:13.400
- One neighbors are vampires. 
 - Ah, I'm dreaming.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.560
No, you're not. 
 They're vampires, all right.

08:15.560 --> 08:19.760
- They gotta be. 
 - There's no such thing as vampires.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.360
Now go away.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.680
Remember those big crates 
 that guy delivered?

08:23.680 --> 08:25.480
I think I know what was in 'em.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.760
Me too. 
 Refrigerators.

08:27.760 --> 08:31.320
No. 
 I'll bet it was their coffins.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.120
And I'm gonna check tonight.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.720
I'm gonna wait till they leave, 
 then get into their basement.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.080
If I find refrigerators, 
 then I'm a jerk,

08:40.080 --> 08:41.720
and you can bust on me all you want.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.040
But if I'm right and I find coffins, 
 then our neighbors are vampires,

08:46.040 --> 08:48.920
and we are in big-time trouble.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.960
She's going into 
 a vampire's basement?

08:55.960 --> 08:59.280
At night? 
 Adios, Emma.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.200
But they might not be vampires.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.920
Then why are all those people 
 getting sick?

09:04.920 --> 09:09.000
Yeah, like blood was being 
 sucked from their necks.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.600
- I love it. 
 - What happened?

09:11.600 --> 09:15.040
Emma didn't know for sure 
 if they were vampires,

09:15.040 --> 09:20.480
so she had to investigate. 
 And that night, she did.

09:22.120 --> 09:22.870
Oh!

09:24.640 --> 09:27.200
What are you doing?

09:27.200 --> 09:30.160
- Vampires don't like garlic. 
 - Neither do I.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.400
Maybe I'm a vampire.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.280
We're safe as long 
 as you remember one thing:

09:36.280 --> 09:38.720
a vampire can't come 
 into someone's home

09:38.720 --> 09:39.960
unless it's been invited.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.280
So never, ever invite 
 the Brauns inside, got it?

09:43.280 --> 09:45.440
Yeah, I'll try 
 and remember that.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.360
Good.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.760
You're not really going 
 into their basement, are you?

09:52.680 --> 09:56.520
- What if you get caught? 
 - I won't. Don't worry. Look.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.000
They leave the same time 
 every night.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Probably in search 
 of their next victims.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.680
[gasps]

10:47.680 --> 10:50.640
[doorbell rings]

10:50.640 --> 10:52.480
I'll get it.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.200
Hello. 
 We are your new neighbors.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.200
Might we come in?

11:00.200 --> 11:03.120
Uh, sure. Come on in.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.920
No, wait. 
 Um-- um, my dad's not home,

11:06.920 --> 11:10.080
and maybe you should 
 come back another time.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.920
Bye. 
 [sighing]

11:12.920 --> 11:17.000
- Who's there, Dayday? 
 - Uh, nobody. Wrong house.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.360
Oh, hello. 
 You're from next door.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.440
Come in, come in.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.000
[gnawing]

12:18.280 --> 12:22.000
I'm sorry my husband isn't here. 
 He works late.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.400
Ah, we know what 
 that's like, eh?

12:24.400 --> 12:26.400
We both work evenings.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.720
It's been hard on poor Lex.

12:29.720 --> 12:32.880
He hasnt been well 
 since we moved here.

12:32.880 --> 12:37.640
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
 What is it you do for work?

12:38.600 --> 12:42.480
We've been studying your 
 emergency health care services.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.240
Paramedics, you call it.

12:45.240 --> 12:48.600
We ride with ambulances 
 to study different techniques

12:48.600 --> 12:50.920
we can bring back to our country.

12:50.920 --> 12:56.880
It's absolutely fascinating work, 
 although sometimes a bit, um...

12:56.880 --> 12:58.720
bloody.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.000
It's a refrigerator.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.600
Dayday's never gonna 
 let me forget this.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.880
Why would they lock a refrigerator?

13:27.320 --> 13:31.880
If I can crack 'em at school, 
 I can crack 'em here.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.920
You've been most gracious, 
 Mrs. Toll,

13:37.920 --> 13:40.320
but we only came 
 to introduce ourselves,

13:40.320 --> 13:42.800
and we must get Lex home.

13:42.800 --> 13:46.320
Well, I'm so glad we finnaly met.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.800
Please drop by anytime.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.840
No. I mean, don't leave yet.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.240
- You just got here. 
 - I'm afraid Lex needs to rest.

13:55.240 --> 14:01.400
But... we can play video games. 
 It'll be great, right, Lex?

14:02.480 --> 14:04.280
Maybe not.

14:04.280 --> 14:07.320
- MOM: It's getting late, Dayday. 
 - Don't worry, Dayday.

14:07.320 --> 14:12.040
Now that we've been invited, 
 I promise you we'll be back.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.520
[creaking]

14:31.760 --> 14:34.160
[bottles rattling]

14:39.360 --> 14:41.560
Aaaaaggggghhhhhh!

14:41.560 --> 14:45.640
- What are you doing here? 
 - The Brauns are coming home.

14:45.640 --> 14:50.320
- Come on! 
 - Wait. I gotta see something.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.960
No coffins?

14:55.960 --> 14:58.120
No. They've got these 
 refrigerators locked,

14:58.120 --> 15:00.760
and I want to see why.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.080
What is it?

15:12.480 --> 15:16.360
- It's blood. 
 - [door slams]

15:17.480 --> 15:21.760
Come on, Dayday. 
 Help me put that tarp on there.

15:38.120 --> 15:42.080
no coffins, no vampires-- 
 you said so.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.120
Dayday, they had bottles of blood.

15:44.120 --> 15:47.240
They're vampires, all right, 
 and you invited them in.

15:47.240 --> 15:50.120
Did not. Mom did.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.080
- It doesn't matter. 
 - I think they found their next victims.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.880
- Who? 
 - Us?

15:56.880 --> 15:59.760
They were invited in, remember?

16:01.240 --> 16:05.280
We got to tell somebody. 
 Mom and Dad... or the police.

16:05.280 --> 16:09.440
They'll never believe us. 
 We're the only one who know,

16:09.440 --> 16:12.160
and we're the only ones 
 who can stop them.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.480
Yeah? How?

16:16.880 --> 16:21.240
Tomorrow after school, 
 before it's dark,

16:21.240 --> 16:24.760
we got to get them 
 before they get us.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.720
Here. Put this on.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.120
What's in it?

16:41.120 --> 16:44.120
Wooden spikes. 
 We have to find the coffins,

16:44.120 --> 16:46.920
and drive the wooden spikes 
 through their hearts.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.800
Uh-uh. 
 This is too gross for me.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.960
Here. 
 Wear this, just in case.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.920
Forget it.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.080
I'm not going.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.280
Dayday, 
 if we don't stop them today,

17:02.280 --> 17:05.440
they may come for us tonight.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.800
[engine running]

17:41.080 --> 17:42.920
Watch your head.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.080
Now what?

17:46.080 --> 17:50.000
I think I know 
 where the coffins are.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.920
- There. 
 - [panting]

17:57.840 --> 18:01.080
- I think I'm gonna puke. 
 - Come on.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.000
[moans]

18:05.080 --> 18:08.360
- Oh, it's locked. 
 - Don't worry, it's a cheap one.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.840
I can open it. 
 Here, hold this.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.360
- Hold it still. 
 - Well, I'm scared, Em.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.840
Me too, but get a grip.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.200
Hurry.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.200
- Hurry. 
 - It's harder than I thought.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.040
I got it.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.880
[car horn honks]

19:39.680 --> 19:42.880
- Who was that? 
 - I don't know. Let's bolt.

20:11.600 --> 20:15.760
I thought vampires 
 couldn't go in the sun.

20:15.760 --> 20:19.720
- They can't. 
 - Hello, children.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.960
You must be Dayday's sister, Emma.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.280
I thought you worked at night.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.240
We did, 
 but the schedule changed.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.600
Thank goodness.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.480
DAYDAY: 
 What's that?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.920
It's blood from the hospital. 
 They have a surplus,

20:50.920 --> 20:54.160
and we've been storing 
 the extra units here for them.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.960
Dayday, Lex is still 
 not feeling very well.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.280
We thought having 
 a friend might help.

20:59.280 --> 21:03.080
Would it be all right 
 if he came over to your house

21:03.080 --> 21:05.400
to play video games 
 with you tonight?

21:05.400 --> 21:10.040
- Oh, yeah. Sure. 
 - Oh, wonderful.

21:10.040 --> 21:13.640
Maybe we'll see 
 you later too, hmm?

21:13.640 --> 21:18.120
- Nice to meet you, Emma. 
 - Ciao.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.080
[chuckling]

21:26.080 --> 21:29.280
They work in a hospital. 
 That's why they have blood.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.080
And how was I supposed 
 to know that?

21:31.080 --> 21:33.920
We better get them 
 before they get us, Dayday.

21:33.920 --> 21:38.640
- Ooh, I'm so scared. 
 - All right, I made a mistake.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.720
I'm never gonna 
 let you forget this.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.640
Oh, give me a break.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.840
You're a loser. 
 You're a big loser.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.080
They were in here, 
 weren't they?

21:51.080 --> 21:53.280
I'm afraid so.

21:53.280 --> 21:57.560
No matter. 
 Tonight's the night.

22:15.200 --> 22:20.600
Wake up, Master. 
 The sun is gone.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.920
You'll feel better soon, Master.

22:25.920 --> 22:29.640
You've been invited in 
 by new victims.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.000
Ahh.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.800
You were wise in coming 
 on this country.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.920
There is so much more 
 fresh blood here.

22:36.920 --> 22:41.480
And no one believe that 
 the little boy can be a vampire.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.160
Ha ha ha.

22:52.114 --> 22:54.140
With ghosts and ghouls 
 there are no rules,

22:54.140 --> 23:02.088
but a vampire's bite 
 only comes at night.

23:02.655 --> 23:05.527
The End.

23:08.447 --> 23:13.005
I declare this meeting of 
 the Midnight Society closed.

23:14.688 --> 23:17.175
Until next time.

23:19.538 --> 23:23.481
Pleasant dreams, everyone.
