NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, sorry, kids.</i>

00:41.480 --> 00:43.880
<i>I forgot to mention</i>
<i>there's a bit of a backstory</i>

00:43.882 --> 00:45.716
<i>to this particular slap.</i>

00:45.718 --> 00:46.900
Oh, man.

00:46.902 --> 00:48.518
Oh.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.787
At least it landed
on the mustard stain.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.390
Don't bother.
That suit is a stain.

00:53.392 --> 00:56.359
A stain on the very institution
of suits.

00:56.361 --> 00:57.894
You know what tie goes
with that suit?

00:57.896 --> 01:00.047
The tie at the top
of a Hefty bag.

01:00.049 --> 01:01.231
A suit like that

01:01.233 --> 01:03.667
only needs one button...
self-destruct.

01:03.669 --> 01:04.851
Hey, I bought him
that suit.

01:04.852 --> 01:06.536
Where? Barfs Brothers?

01:07.205 --> 01:09.106
Men's Outhouse?

01:09.108 --> 01:11.341
Giorgio Arms...
Are-Not-the-Same-Lengthy?

01:12.527 --> 01:15.645
That suit is a slap in the face
to all suits everywhere.

01:15.647 --> 01:17.898
A slap in the face.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.900
Uh, yes, Barney.

01:19.902 --> 01:22.569
There's something I need to
tell you about the next slap

01:22.571 --> 01:23.870
that you're going to receive.

01:23.872 --> 01:24.988
You see,

01:24.990 --> 01:26.773
I want this slap to be

01:26.775 --> 01:29.910
as painful as
humanly possible.

01:29.912 --> 01:31.812
BOTH: Sure. Sure.
Okay, okay.

01:31.814 --> 01:33.647
Yeah, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

01:33.649 --> 01:37.167
Yes, you won a slap bet
with me seven years ago.

01:37.169 --> 01:38.552
And, yes, over the years,

01:38.554 --> 01:40.720
you got in some great slaps.

01:40.722 --> 01:43.423
Some great slaps.

01:43.425 --> 01:44.491
But here's the problem.

01:44.493 --> 01:46.593
You've tormented me so much

01:46.595 --> 01:48.295
that I am now immune to it.

01:48.297 --> 01:49.162
Hmm.
It's as if

01:49.164 --> 01:52.265
my face, my psyche, my soul

01:52.267 --> 01:54.501
were covered
in that numbing cream

01:54.503 --> 01:56.837
we all put on our deals
so that we can go all night.

01:56.839 --> 01:58.054
Am I right, fellas?

01:59.607 --> 02:02.742
Okay, we'll all just pretend
like we've never done that.

02:02.744 --> 02:06.046
Just like we've never sat on our
left hand until it fell asleep

02:06.048 --> 02:08.148
and then used it
for an away gamer.

02:08.850 --> 02:10.032
Okay.

02:10.035 --> 02:11.033
We'll all pretend

02:11.036 --> 02:12.169
like we've never done that.

02:12.171 --> 02:13.136
Just like we've all never taken

02:13.138 --> 02:14.905
two live jumper cables...

02:14.907 --> 02:16.373
Please stop.

02:16.375 --> 02:17.958
Barney, I'm well-aware
that you've developed

02:17.960 --> 02:20.076
a resistance to all
of my old tricks,

02:20.078 --> 02:23.313
which is why I sought
out special training.

02:23.315 --> 02:26.533
Hi, hey, I'm sure you get
this question all the time.

02:26.535 --> 02:29.619
But is there a special class
where I just learn slapping?

02:29.621 --> 02:31.304
We teach kung fu here.

02:31.306 --> 02:33.122
Right, see,
the thing is, I don't need

02:33.124 --> 02:34.608
to learn anything about kicking.

02:34.610 --> 02:35.425
You know?

02:35.427 --> 02:37.144
'Cause, uh...

02:38.596 --> 02:39.646
So, yeah.

02:39.648 --> 02:41.681
I'm good there.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.517
Um, what I really need
to learn is slapping.

02:43.519 --> 02:45.969
I need someone to teach me
how to slap my friend

02:45.971 --> 02:49.105
just like really hard
right in his stupid face.

02:49.107 --> 02:50.307
Can you teach me that?

02:50.309 --> 02:53.276
Kung fu is an ancient
and honorable martial art.

02:53.278 --> 02:54.561
It must be learned
with great devotion

02:54.563 --> 02:57.280
and respect.

02:58.449 --> 03:00.534
So, where are we on this
whole slapping thing?

03:00.536 --> 03:02.002
Yes, no, maybe...?
Get out.

03:04.422 --> 03:05.505
Psst.

03:05.507 --> 03:07.340
I know what you seek.

03:07.342 --> 03:08.608
You seek to learn

03:08.610 --> 03:10.427
the Slap of a Thousand

03:10.429 --> 03:12.429
Exploding Suns.

03:12.431 --> 03:14.664
Yes, that's totally
a thing I've heard of.

03:14.666 --> 03:16.049
Can you teach me?

03:16.051 --> 03:18.167
No, but I know who can.

03:18.169 --> 03:20.053
Can you take me
to this great master?

03:20.055 --> 03:21.304
I have much gold.

03:21.306 --> 03:24.975
It is not one great master
you seek but three.

03:24.977 --> 03:26.175
They will teach you

03:26.177 --> 03:29.779
the three mighty virtues
of slapistry.

03:29.781 --> 03:30.730
Speed.

03:31.799 --> 03:33.316
Strength.

03:33.318 --> 03:36.770
And accuracy.

03:36.772 --> 03:39.022
Put these
three virtues together,

03:39.024 --> 03:41.691
and only then
will you have mastered

03:41.693 --> 03:43.860
the Slap of a Million

03:43.862 --> 03:47.264
Exploding Suns.

03:47.266 --> 03:49.165
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but a second ago,

03:49.167 --> 03:51.835
wasn't it the Slap
of a Thousand Exploding Suns?

03:51.837 --> 03:54.104
Pretty sure I said a million, guys?
I heard a million.

03:54.106 --> 03:55.338
He said a million.
One million.

03:55.340 --> 03:57.674
MARSHALL:
<i>So I went to Shanghai...</i>

03:57.676 --> 03:58.775
You didn't go to Shanghai.

03:58.777 --> 03:59.576
I went to Shanghai.

03:59.578 --> 04:00.427
When did you go to Shanghai?

04:00.429 --> 04:01.561
Last year I went
to Shanghai.

04:01.563 --> 04:02.362
You didn't go to Shanghai.

04:02.364 --> 04:03.630
He went to Shanghai.

04:03.632 --> 04:05.248
He didn't go to Shanghai.
Totally went to Shanghai.

04:05.250 --> 04:05.916
You didn't go to Shanghai.

04:05.918 --> 04:06.816
So I went to Shanghai.

04:08.786 --> 04:11.571
<i>In search of the first master.</i>

04:13.441 --> 04:16.409
Are you Red Bird?

04:21.866 --> 04:24.317
BARNEY:
<i>Okay, enough.</i>

04:24.319 --> 04:25.852
I know you're trying
to freak me out.

04:25.854 --> 04:27.454
But like I said,
it's not working.

04:27.456 --> 04:29.556
So I will give you much gold

04:29.558 --> 04:31.424
to stop wasting my time.

04:31.426 --> 04:33.476
Hold that thought, I just want
to see if can fix this.

04:33.478 --> 04:35.045
(song skipping)

04:35.047 --> 04:37.213
(groans)

04:41.936 --> 04:43.053
(all gasp)

04:43.055 --> 04:44.387
ALL:
The Slap of...

04:44.389 --> 04:45.939
Ten Million Exploding Suns!
500 Exploding Suns!

04:45.941 --> 04:47.223
Three Billion Exploding Stars!

04:48.225 --> 04:50.777
Whoops.

04:54.449 --> 04:55.583
(chuckles)

04:55.585 --> 04:57.051
(sighs)

04:57.053 --> 04:59.253
(gasps)

04:59.255 --> 05:01.839
Relax, I'm not gonna
slap you right now.

05:01.841 --> 05:03.240
(grunts)

05:03.242 --> 05:06.710
When I slap you, it shall be
beneath a willow tree

05:06.712 --> 05:10.598
next to four women and a tiger.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.933
A willow tree,
four women and a tiger?

05:12.935 --> 05:14.351
What are you talking about?

05:14.353 --> 05:17.438
Who said anything about a willow
tree, four women and a tiger?

05:17.440 --> 05:18.739
Guys?
Nobody.

05:18.741 --> 05:20.040
A tiger?
You were totally silent just now.

05:20.042 --> 05:22.476
But Marshall just said that!

05:22.478 --> 05:23.544
What is going on?

05:23.546 --> 05:26.280
How did you do that
to the jukebox?

05:26.282 --> 05:28.749
Wait, it's fake.

05:28.751 --> 05:30.818
That's a prop jukebox,

05:30.820 --> 05:32.987
designed just to mess with me.

05:32.989 --> 05:35.389
Marshall, that jukebox
cost eight grand.

05:36.174 --> 05:38.626
I have much gold.

05:40.912 --> 05:42.596
Huh, that is much.

05:43.215 --> 05:44.682
You got lucky, Eriksen.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.451
I don't like this!

05:47.453 --> 05:49.270
I thought that nothing
I said or did

05:49.272 --> 05:50.721
could intimidate you anymore.

05:50.723 --> 05:52.690
(stammers)
That's right.

05:52.692 --> 05:54.492
It can't.

05:54.494 --> 05:56.677
(sniffs)
(yells)

05:56.679 --> 05:57.628
Itch.

05:57.630 --> 05:58.729
Look.

05:58.731 --> 06:00.114
If you're really nervous,

06:00.116 --> 06:01.816
don't think of it as a slap.

06:01.818 --> 06:04.218
Think of it as a high five.
Okay.

06:04.220 --> 06:06.170
For your stupid face.
(Barney crying)

06:06.172 --> 06:07.338
So, anyway, I'm in
the noodle house...

06:07.340 --> 06:08.522
I'll admit.

06:08.524 --> 06:09.957
I didn't expect Red Bird,

06:09.959 --> 06:13.744
Master of Speed, to be a girl.

06:13.746 --> 06:15.379
You sure you really
know how to...?

06:15.381 --> 06:17.882
What is the sound
of one hand slapping?

06:17.884 --> 06:20.384
I'm sorry, I don't understa...

06:20.386 --> 06:22.002
(slap)

06:22.954 --> 06:24.621
Wait, how did you...?

06:24.623 --> 06:25.806
(slap)

06:27.309 --> 06:28.509
Lucky shot, I wasn't ready...

06:28.511 --> 06:29.727
(slap)

06:31.446 --> 06:33.180
You know, that tip
isn't a full 20%...

06:33.182 --> 06:34.732
(two slaps)

06:36.234 --> 06:37.818
Train me, Red Bird.

06:37.820 --> 06:39.220
Teach me speed.

06:39.222 --> 06:40.488
No.

06:40.490 --> 06:42.256
I retired long ago.

06:42.258 --> 06:44.058
Retired? You're like, 32.

06:44.060 --> 06:45.860
I am 86 years old.

06:46.695 --> 06:48.095
But slapping is now

06:48.097 --> 06:49.363
a part of my past.

06:49.365 --> 06:53.250
Darn, I really wanted
to slap Barney Stinson.

06:53.252 --> 06:54.869
This is to slap Barney Stinson?

06:54.871 --> 06:56.704
Yeah, okay.

06:56.706 --> 06:58.956
I'll totally teach you.

06:58.958 --> 07:00.991
MARSHALL:
<i>And so began my training.</i>

07:00.993 --> 07:04.161
Slap this tree.

07:04.163 --> 07:05.162
Slap the tree?

07:05.164 --> 07:06.931
If you can.

07:09.301 --> 07:11.218
I mean...

07:11.220 --> 07:12.853
Seems pretty easy.

07:17.526 --> 07:18.926
Ooh!

07:18.928 --> 07:20.528
What the...?

07:21.679 --> 07:23.864
Ooh!

07:23.866 --> 07:26.483
The fabled Slapping Tree

07:26.485 --> 07:28.536
of Gongqing Forest.

07:28.538 --> 07:29.520
BARNEY:
<i>Beg your pardon.</i>

07:29.522 --> 07:31.522
The "Fabled Slapping Tree

07:31.524 --> 07:34.542
of Gongqing Forest"?
Sure.

07:34.544 --> 07:36.460
Really? "Fabled."
Mmm.

07:36.462 --> 07:38.112
'Cause I've never heard of it.

07:38.114 --> 07:39.079
I'm pretty sure
everybody's heard of it.

07:39.081 --> 07:40.331
Guys?
Yup.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.966
Totally, yeah.
I backpacked there in college.

07:41.968 --> 07:42.900
See?

07:42.902 --> 07:44.385
Fabled.
It even inspired

07:44.387 --> 07:46.720
a popular Chinese
children's book.

07:47.956 --> 07:49.423
<i>It's a poignant parable</i>

07:49.425 --> 07:52.810
whose message, is if you
love someone, set them free.

07:53.511 --> 07:54.979
But not before first

07:54.981 --> 07:57.548
slapping them right
in their stupid face.

07:58.350 --> 08:00.184
<i>As my training continued,</i>

08:00.186 --> 08:03.487
<i>I also learned the delicate art</i>
<i>of Chinese painting.</i>

08:05.073 --> 08:07.057
That looks nothing
like this bowl of fruit!

08:09.194 --> 08:10.544
MARSHALL:
<i>My training went on for a year.</i>

08:10.546 --> 08:12.229
A year?
A year.

08:12.231 --> 08:14.031
One year?
None of us noticed

08:14.033 --> 08:16.867
you were stuck in Shanghai
for a year?

08:16.869 --> 08:18.568
I wasn't being held slaptive,

08:18.570 --> 08:20.971
I chose to stay and
complete my training.

08:20.973 --> 08:23.123
I'm not even gonna...

08:23.125 --> 08:24.592
Just, whatever.

08:25.377 --> 08:26.477
You have shown great slaptitude,

08:26.479 --> 08:28.045
young one.

08:28.047 --> 08:30.581
You are ready
for your final test.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.783
Slap me.

08:32.784 --> 08:33.917
What?

08:33.919 --> 08:34.852
Slap me, now!

08:34.854 --> 08:36.604
No, Red Bird, I can't.

08:36.606 --> 08:38.038
Slap me-- that is not a request.

08:38.039 --> 08:38.839
I won't!

08:38.841 --> 08:39.773
The Vikings will never

08:39.775 --> 08:41.591
win the Super Bo...
(slap)

08:42.427 --> 08:44.144
Wait, how did you...?
(slap)

08:44.145 --> 08:45.095
Lucky shot.

08:45.097 --> 08:46.680
I wasn't re...
(slap)

08:46.682 --> 08:47.881
That's a big tip.

08:47.883 --> 08:48.932
You must have much gold.

08:48.934 --> 08:50.985
(two slaps)

08:50.987 --> 08:53.504
You are ready
for your final step.

08:53.506 --> 08:55.105
Awesome! Oh, man!

08:55.107 --> 08:57.107
I can't wait
to slap Barney Stinson

08:57.109 --> 08:58.775
right across his stupid fa...

08:58.777 --> 09:00.961
(slapping)

09:02.464 --> 09:04.965
What? What did I say?

09:04.967 --> 09:07.685
You must not slap anyone
until your training is complete.

09:07.687 --> 09:10.054
The consequences could be dire.

09:10.056 --> 09:13.273
First, you must meet
White Flower,

09:13.275 --> 09:16.794
the second master,
who will teach you strength.

09:16.796 --> 09:18.412
She lives atop a mountain.

09:18.414 --> 09:19.496
Which mountain?

09:19.498 --> 09:22.599
No, not Witch Mountain.

09:22.601 --> 09:24.551
Slap Mountain.

09:24.553 --> 09:27.855
BARNEY: <i>Hate to cut in</i>
<i>again here, but...</i>

09:27.857 --> 09:30.157
Slap Mountain?
That's right.

09:30.159 --> 09:32.009
You're claiming there's
a mountain in China

09:32.011 --> 09:34.611
in the exact shape of a hand?

09:34.613 --> 09:35.612
Everyone knows that.

09:35.614 --> 09:36.646
Right, guys?
True.

09:36.648 --> 09:38.399
Totally.
I backpacked there in college.

09:38.401 --> 09:41.035
It's the largest
of the Slappalachian Mountains.

09:41.037 --> 09:42.219
(groans)

09:42.221 --> 09:43.420
And at the top...

09:47.759 --> 09:49.493
Excuse me? Uh, do you know

09:49.495 --> 09:51.562
where I can find White Flower?

09:52.647 --> 09:55.299
How dare you speak that name?

09:55.301 --> 09:58.719
That is the most feared name
in 40 villages!

09:58.721 --> 10:01.105
Really? "White Flower"?

10:01.107 --> 10:03.307
I'm sorry, it's just,
it's not exactly Voldemort.

10:03.309 --> 10:04.375
Bro!

10:04.377 --> 10:05.976
Why don't yo
just say "Candyman"

10:05.978 --> 10:07.344
three times and be done with it?

10:07.346 --> 10:08.562
Geez!

10:16.104 --> 10:18.322
(fly buzzing)

10:22.277 --> 10:24.411
Awesome!

10:24.413 --> 10:26.497
Can-can you teach me
how to do that?

10:26.499 --> 10:29.316
No, I retired
from teaching long ago.

10:29.318 --> 10:30.934
Retired? You're like, 32.

10:30.936 --> 10:33.253
I am 106 years old.

10:33.255 --> 10:35.122
What is in these noodles?

10:35.124 --> 10:37.725
I'm sorry,
but my slapping days are over.

10:37.727 --> 10:39.876
Darn, I really wanted

10:39.878 --> 10:43.280
this next Barney Stinson slap
to be special.

10:43.282 --> 10:44.932
This is to slap Barney Stinson?
Mmm.

10:44.934 --> 10:46.984
Yeah, okay,
I'll totally teach you.

10:49.871 --> 10:51.438
The true power of any slap

10:51.440 --> 10:53.507
comes from the anger behind it.

10:53.509 --> 10:56.226
So for a truly devastating slap,

10:56.228 --> 10:59.263
you must harvest
the anger of many.

10:59.265 --> 11:00.597
Every time

11:00.599 --> 11:03.450
someone who hates Barney
slaps you in the face,

11:03.452 --> 11:07.121
the power of their anger goes
from your face

11:07.123 --> 11:08.589
into your hand.

11:11.092 --> 11:13.994
MARSHALL: <i>White Flower and I made love</i>
<i>that night in the forest.</i>

11:13.996 --> 11:16.063
No, sorry. Flag on the play.

11:16.065 --> 11:17.765
You banged White Flower?

11:17.767 --> 11:20.601
I made love to White Flower.

11:20.603 --> 11:22.753
And then I banged her.

11:22.755 --> 11:23.687
In the forest?

11:23.689 --> 11:25.689
In Gongqing Forest, yes.

11:25.691 --> 11:28.609
Actually right near
the Slapping Tree.

11:28.611 --> 11:31.612
Which may or may not
have come into play.

11:31.614 --> 11:32.863
Oh, my God,
you had a tree-way?

11:34.933 --> 11:37.167
And, Lily, you were okay
with Marshall having an affair?

11:37.169 --> 11:39.203
What happens
in the magical Gongqing Forest

11:39.205 --> 11:41.405
stays in the magical
Gongqing Forest.

11:41.407 --> 11:43.307
Best wife ever.

11:44.309 --> 11:45.626
Like I was saying,

11:45.628 --> 11:47.377
you need to harvest the anger

11:47.379 --> 11:49.196
of others into your own slap.

11:49.198 --> 11:50.214
Now, dig deep.

11:50.216 --> 11:52.749
Can you think of anyone,

11:52.751 --> 11:54.168
anyone at all

11:54.170 --> 11:56.620
who hates Barney Stinson?

11:57.405 --> 11:59.189
(both laughing)

12:00.892 --> 12:02.926
I know, I know, I almost
couldn't get through it

12:02.928 --> 12:04.228
with a straight face!

12:04.230 --> 12:06.430
There are just so many people

12:06.432 --> 12:08.982
who hate Barney's guts!

12:10.134 --> 12:12.135
Moving on.

12:12.137 --> 12:13.470
(sighs)

12:13.472 --> 12:16.023
The point is, you need
to go get slapped in the face

12:16.025 --> 12:18.659
by a bunch of gullible chicks
Barney banged.

12:18.661 --> 12:20.911
I'm a friend
of Barney Stinson. Ooh!

12:20.913 --> 12:22.496
I'm a friend of Barney Stins...

12:22.498 --> 12:24.814
I-I'm-I'm a friend
of Barney Stinson. Aah!

12:24.816 --> 12:25.916
Ooh!

12:25.918 --> 12:26.884
I'm so sorry.

12:26.886 --> 12:27.918
I thought you said you were

12:27.920 --> 12:28.936
a friend of Barney Stinson.

12:28.938 --> 12:30.487
I did. Ooh!

12:30.489 --> 12:31.538
Oh!

12:31.540 --> 12:35.158
Ooh! Wow!

12:35.160 --> 12:38.595
Could you... also...

12:38.597 --> 12:41.215
slap me in the face?

12:41.217 --> 12:43.734
God, you're just
as perverted as Barney.

12:43.736 --> 12:45.769
Ooh!

12:45.771 --> 12:47.855
(groans)

12:47.857 --> 12:50.107
<i>And after a while...</i>

12:54.279 --> 12:56.613
Look at this thing--
it's all hot and glowy!

12:56.615 --> 12:59.182
I'll never have
cold pizza again!

12:59.184 --> 13:01.869
I'll never have cold pizza
again.

13:01.871 --> 13:02.586
Silence!

13:02.588 --> 13:04.037
Sorry, White Flower.

13:04.039 --> 13:05.689
I've just got
a slappetite for destruction.

13:05.691 --> 13:06.856
Thanks for everything!

13:06.858 --> 13:08.075
I'm gonna go slap Barney Stinson

13:08.077 --> 13:09.493
right in his stupid face!

13:09.495 --> 13:12.045
Wait, first you must
go learn accuracy

13:12.047 --> 13:14.381
from the one who is called
The Calligrapher

13:14.383 --> 13:17.534
in the far-off,
mystical land of...

13:19.671 --> 13:21.071
Cleveland?
Cleveland.

13:21.073 --> 13:22.389
Why Cleveland?

13:22.391 --> 13:23.640
It's the city equivalent

13:23.642 --> 13:25.375
of being slapped in the face.

13:25.377 --> 13:26.593
Bro.

13:26.595 --> 13:29.963
Man, is this place
a chain or something?

13:29.965 --> 13:30.931
One for dinner?

13:30.933 --> 13:34.902
No, I'm here to meet her.

13:34.904 --> 13:37.888
Bro.

13:42.293 --> 13:43.810
Can you teach me accuracy?

13:43.812 --> 13:45.345
I can.

13:45.347 --> 13:47.614
The proper question is: will I?

13:47.616 --> 13:49.583
Grammar is the first step

13:49.585 --> 13:52.636
on the thousand-mile journey
to accuracy.

13:52.638 --> 13:56.490
I'm, uh, assuming there's
no Mrs. The Calligrapher?

13:56.492 --> 13:58.926
The path I've chosen
is lonesome.

13:58.928 --> 14:00.043
But it's no big deal.

14:00.045 --> 14:02.078
I prefer being alone,
I really do.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.580
Unless you know
any single ladies

14:03.582 --> 14:05.015
you-you-you could
set me up with.

14:05.017 --> 14:08.084
Nope.
Good, because I prefer being alone.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.070
Also I'm sorry,

14:10.072 --> 14:13.507
but I retired
from teaching long ago.

14:13.509 --> 14:15.042
Retired? You're like, 35.

14:15.044 --> 14:17.444
(groans)
I'm 34.

14:17.446 --> 14:18.445
Oh, sorry.

14:18.447 --> 14:20.147
I use moisturizer every night.

14:20.149 --> 14:22.616
I thought my skin
still looked vibrant.

14:22.618 --> 14:23.917
It does, it does.

14:23.919 --> 14:25.402
Look, uh, I'm just...

14:25.404 --> 14:27.738
I'm really just here
to finish my training,

14:27.740 --> 14:29.790
um, so, the, uh,
look, the truth is,

14:29.792 --> 14:32.909
I have a divorced cousin
just outside of Akron.

14:32.911 --> 14:35.879
Now, I wouldn't call Janice
easy on the eyes--

14:35.881 --> 14:38.081
or the springs
of a bathroom scale--

14:38.083 --> 14:40.500
but if you want,
I could set you up.

14:40.502 --> 14:42.502
Sold! Now, the most
important lesson

14:42.504 --> 14:44.755
in learning accuracy...
(choking)

14:49.811 --> 14:52.128
He was dying right
before my eyes.

14:52.130 --> 14:55.032
So I did the only thing
that I could think to do.

14:55.034 --> 14:57.901
(stammers)
Please!

14:57.903 --> 14:59.569
<i>I slapped his back.</i>

14:59.571 --> 15:00.804
And that's when I found out why

15:00.806 --> 15:03.073
"No slapping until
your training is complete"

15:03.075 --> 15:05.075
is the most important rule.

15:05.077 --> 15:06.943
Because my slap...

15:06.945 --> 15:09.646
was too powerful.

15:09.648 --> 15:12.082
I hadn't learned accuracy

15:12.084 --> 15:14.785
and so I couldn't control it.

15:14.787 --> 15:16.169
And, well...

15:25.229 --> 15:28.749
No!

15:28.751 --> 15:30.650
Stop it! Just stop!

15:30.652 --> 15:33.937
You did not slap the heart
out of a man's body!

15:33.939 --> 15:35.889
If only that were true.

15:35.891 --> 15:38.225
You're saying
that you committed a murder?

15:38.227 --> 15:40.009
I was trying to save him!

15:40.011 --> 15:42.512
Shh, baby, it's okay,
you didn't mean to.

15:42.514 --> 15:43.697
He doesn't sleep.

15:43.699 --> 15:44.848
You got to move on.
You were only trying to help.

15:44.850 --> 15:46.917
You're making
this whole story up.

15:46.919 --> 15:48.852
I wish that I were.

15:48.854 --> 15:50.370
Because of the tragedy,

15:50.372 --> 15:51.538
I never got to
finish my training.

15:51.540 --> 15:54.207
I never learned accuracy.

15:54.209 --> 15:57.244
Because of that,
I shall remain...

15:57.246 --> 15:59.329
forever...

15:59.331 --> 16:02.332
a mere slapprentice.

16:02.334 --> 16:04.084
What does that mean, baby?

16:04.086 --> 16:05.719
NARRATOR:
<i>Here's what it meant.</i>

16:05.721 --> 16:08.422
("O Fortuna" playing)

16:13.694 --> 16:14.845
(Barney gasps)

16:14.847 --> 16:15.896
(yelling)

16:15.898 --> 16:17.881
Damn it!

16:18.320 --> 16:20.205
Please! Somebody!

16:21.251 --> 16:22.917
Help me!

16:22.919 --> 16:26.837
There's a crazy guy trying
to slap me and he's...

16:26.839 --> 16:28.506
Oh, my God.

16:28.508 --> 16:30.241
Four women.

16:30.243 --> 16:31.592
And a willow tree.

16:33.428 --> 16:35.012
At least there's no tiger.

16:36.882 --> 16:38.249
Oh, my God.

16:38.251 --> 16:41.252
Is that... half a tiger?

16:41.254 --> 16:42.853
You got here early.

16:42.855 --> 16:45.256
Aah!

16:46.591 --> 16:47.642
It's time.

16:47.644 --> 16:50.427
But you never completed
your training.

16:50.429 --> 16:52.280
Actually...

16:52.282 --> 16:54.431
Listen to me.
I must speak fast.

16:54.433 --> 16:56.450
Once you've had your heart
slapped out of your body,

16:56.452 --> 16:58.819
you've only got ten,
15 minutes to live, max.

16:58.821 --> 17:01.539
Sure.
The trick to accuracy

17:01.541 --> 17:03.941
is to, like,
try to be really accurate.

17:03.943 --> 17:05.492
Okay? Don't just slap.

17:05.494 --> 17:07.444
Like, like, really try to aim.

17:07.445 --> 17:09.946
Look where you're slapping,
that's important.

17:09.949 --> 17:12.133
And then try to slap that spot

17:12.135 --> 17:15.118
instead of some other spot.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.721
Well, I guess
that's pretty much it.

17:16.723 --> 17:17.838
You can slap people now.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.790
(groans)

17:22.010 --> 17:23.594
He's gone.

17:23.596 --> 17:24.795
One other thing.

17:24.797 --> 17:26.480
Cleveland has a lot to offer.

17:26.482 --> 17:29.300
Be sure to check out
the James A. Garfield Monument.

17:29.302 --> 17:31.819
Um, I mean, sure, he was only
president for four months

17:31.821 --> 17:33.271
before he was assassinated,

17:33.273 --> 17:35.606
but if you get up to the top,
you can see almost for 30 miles.

17:35.608 --> 17:37.858
As long as the steel factory's
not smelting.

17:37.860 --> 17:40.661
(groans)

17:41.697 --> 17:42.947
He's gone.

17:42.949 --> 17:46.083
No, like I said,
ten, 15 minutes.

17:47.636 --> 17:49.287
Oh, God, this is awkward.

17:49.289 --> 17:50.788
Yeah, yeah.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.006
It's like when you're saying
good-bye to someone,

17:52.008 --> 17:53.124
and then you realize
you're both heading

17:53.126 --> 17:54.175
in the same direction.

17:54.177 --> 17:55.176
It's like, what
do we, what do we

17:55.178 --> 17:57.161
we say good-bye again or...?

17:57.163 --> 17:59.180
Right...
(groans)

17:59.182 --> 18:01.665
He's gone.

18:03.435 --> 18:06.304
Wait, are you just pretending
so it'll be less awkward?

18:07.105 --> 18:09.190
Should I just, like, go?

18:09.908 --> 18:12.093
Okay.

18:17.683 --> 18:20.568
My training is complete.

18:21.553 --> 18:23.571
I'm ready.

18:25.123 --> 18:27.241
I'm ready, too.

18:28.377 --> 18:29.410
I love you.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.694
Enough to take this slap for me?

18:30.696 --> 18:32.913
No.

18:35.133 --> 18:37.385
♪

19:04.463 --> 19:06.030
(grunts)

19:07.499 --> 19:08.449
That's four!

19:08.451 --> 19:10.201
All right!
Yeah! Oh!

19:10.203 --> 19:12.203
Good one, you got me
that time, bro.

19:12.205 --> 19:13.237
Yeah, right?
Hey, only one slap left.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.839
Crazy! Where did the time go?

19:14.841 --> 19:15.756
I know, it's, like, uh,

19:15.758 --> 19:17.291
slow down, life,
you know what I mean?

19:17.293 --> 19:18.409
(laughter)
