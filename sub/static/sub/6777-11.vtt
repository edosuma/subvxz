01:44.670 --> 01:46.023
C'MON !

01:46.140 --> 01:47.630
C'MON, C'MON.

01:47.740 --> 01:48.934
( female )
OKAY, OKAY !

01:49.040 --> 01:50.029
EVERYTHING UNDER
THE TRAY, TOO, BITCH.

01:50.140 --> 01:51.767
THAT'S ALL OF IT,
HERE, TAKE IT !

01:51.870 --> 01:52.768
THAT'S IT ?

01:52.880 --> 01:53.733
THAT'S ALL I HAVE !

01:53.840 --> 01:55.171
NOW YOU TAKE IT.

01:55.280 --> 01:59.512
NOW GET THE FUCK OU'I'I'A HERE
BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE !

02:17.570 --> 02:18.719
BARB.

02:18.830 --> 02:20.058
IT'S NATE AGAIN.

02:20.170 --> 02:21.364
DID I WAKE YOU UP ?

02:21.470 --> 02:22.459
( female )
No, are you kidding ?

02:22.570 --> 02:23.969
LOOK, HAVE YOU
HEARD ANYTHING ?

02:24.070 --> 02:25.162
I MEAN,
IS SHE THERE ?

02:25.270 --> 02:27.101
No, did you call
the police ?

02:27.210 --> 02:30.805
YEAH, YEAH, THEY FILED
A MISSING PERSON'S REPORT.

02:30.910 --> 02:32.047
Good, good.

02:32.150 --> 02:35.142
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY COULD DO THAT

02:35.250 --> 02:36.410
IF IT HASN'T BEEN
24 HOURS.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.942
Well, I did the
same thing up here.

02:38.050 --> 02:39.711
They said not to bother
calling the highway patrol,

02:39.820 --> 02:41.287
'cause once they put it
into their computer system,

02:41.390 --> 02:43.255
everyone has it
statewide.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.248
But I say fuck it,
let's just keep calling.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.827
HAS SHE ER JUST
LIKE TAKEN OFF ?

02:46.930 --> 02:48.454
I MEAN, HAS SHE EVER DONE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE ?

02:48.560 --> 02:51.393
No, she'd go off
for a day or two,

02:51.500 --> 02:52.569
where nobody would
know where she was,

02:52.670 --> 02:54.035
just to clear out
the cobwebs,

02:54.140 --> 02:56.062
but not since
she had the baby.

02:56.170 --> 02:58.161
YEAH, YEAH,
HER VISION QUESTS, I KNOW.

02:58.270 --> 03:00.272
SHE USED TO DO
THAT IN SEATTLE,

03:00.380 --> 03:01.472
BUT SH E'D ALWAYS
TELL SOMEBODY ABOUT IT.

03:01.580 --> 03:04.447
Nate, if you're wondering
whether or not

03:04.550 --> 03:06.108
I think she
might have left you,

03:06.220 --> 03:08.347
I truly seriously
doubt it.

03:08.450 --> 03:10.111
Not without Maya.

03:10.220 --> 03:11.482
WAIT, YOU THINK SHE
MIGHT HAVE LEFI' ME ?

03:11.590 --> 03:13.114
No, I don't.

03:13.220 --> 03:15.154
Listen, we'll just keep
checking with the police,

03:15.260 --> 03:17.057
and the highway patrol
and she'll turn up.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.024
YEAH.

03:18.130 --> 03:20.758
YEAH, SHE'LL TURN UP.

03:31.410 --> 03:34.538
( helicopter overhead )

03:39.820 --> 03:41.811
( dog barking )

03:44.220 --> 03:46.381
( car alarms )

03:56.300 --> 03:59.736
( phone ringing )

04:11.680 --> 04:12.612
HELLO.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.618
( Nate )
David.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.779
YEAH.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.983
DID YOU FEEL THAT ?

04:17.090 --> 04:17.886
Feel what ?

04:17.990 --> 04:19.048
EARTHQUAKE.

04:19.150 --> 04:21.209
NO, I GUESS
I MISSED IT.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.687
OH, I'M SORRY, I FORGOT
YOU'RE IN SAN DIEGO.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.348
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT,
I CAME BACK EARLY.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.690
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

04:28.800 --> 04:31.894
LISA STILL HASN'T SHOWN UP
AT HER SISTER'S.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.969
NO ONE'S
HEARD FROM HER ?

04:35.070 --> 04:36.264
NO.

04:36.370 --> 04:38.463
She hasn't
called you ?

04:38.570 --> 04:39.434
NO.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.905
Have you tried her
on her cell phone ?

04:41.010 --> 04:44.468
YEAH, LIKE
3O FUCKING TIMES.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.947
DAVID, I'M REALLY STARTING
TO FREAK OUT OVER HERE.

04:51.050 --> 04:52.654
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.649
GIVE ME HALF AN HOUR,
I'M ON MY WAY.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.689
( dance music )

05:29.160 --> 05:31.378
UH!

05:42.810 --> 05:44.937
( Ruth )
I'M SURE
SHE'S FINE, NATE.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.473
YEAH ?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.138
THEN WHY HASN'T SHE ANSWERED
ANY ONE OF THE 30 OR 40 MESSAGES

05:48.240 --> 05:49.741
I'VE LEFI' FOR HER
ON HER VOICE MAIL ?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.647
MAYBE THE BATTERY ON
HER CELL PHONE RAN OUT.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.570
OF WHATEVER IT IS
BATTERIES RUN OUT OF.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.615
IT'S BEEN ALMOST 18 HOURS
SINCE I SPOKE TO HER LAST.

05:56.720 --> 06:00.087
WELL, YOU SAID YOURSELF
SHE DOES THIS KIND OF THING

06:00.190 --> 06:01.487
FROM TIME TO TIME ?

06:01.590 --> 06:02.818
YEAH, BUT SHE WOULD'VE
TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.386
SHE WOULDN'T JUST
TAKE OFF LIKE THIS.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.048
NATE, LISA STRIKES ME
AS VERY CAPABLE

06:06.160 --> 06:07.320
OF TAKING CARE
OF HERSELF.

06:07.430 --> 06:09.489
MORNING.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.934
ANYONE ELSE FEEL
THAT EARTHQUAKE ?

06:14.040 --> 06:16.258
I DID.

06:16.370 --> 06:19.305
WHY ALL THE DOOM
AND GLOOM ?

06:19.410 --> 06:20.536
LISA IS MISSING !

06:20.640 --> 06:21.834
SHE'S NOT MISSING.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.373
WE JUST DON'T QUITE
KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.176
HOLY SHIT.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.009
( phone ringing )

06:28.120 --> 06:30.884
HELLO ?

06:30.990 --> 06:33.151
YES, THIS IS THE FISHER
AND DIAZ FUNERAL HOME.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.148
OF COURSE.

06:35.260 --> 06:37.353
WE COULD TAKE CARE OF ALL
YOUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOU.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.223
YEAH.

06:39.330 --> 06:41.651
ALRIGHT,
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.761
GOODBYE.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.792
WE'VE GOT A FAMILY
COMING IN AT 10:30.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.368
WE'VE ALREADY HAD
TWO INTAKES TODAY.

06:47.470 --> 06:48.562
GREAT.

06:48.670 --> 06:50.934
LOOK, IF THIS IS
TOO MUCH FOR YOU

06:51.040 --> 06:52.701
I CAN GET RICO TO COME IN EARLY
AND ARTHUR CAN HELP,

06:52.810 --> 06:54.368
AND WE'LL
COVER FOR YOU.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.731
THAN KS, I JUST--

06:55.840 --> 06:58.604
I THINK MAYBE TRYING
TO WORK WILL BE BETTER

06:58.710 --> 07:00.473
THAN FOR ME JUST SITTING AROUND
WAITING FOR THE PHONE TO RING.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.548
YOU DO WHATEVER IT IS
YOU NEED TO DO, NATE.

07:02.650 --> 07:05.414
I'LL TAKE MAYA
FOR THE DAY.

07:08.420 --> 07:09.853
THANK YOU.

07:16.330 --> 07:18.821
I'D BETTER
GET DRESSED.

07:23.340 --> 07:25.729
( phone ringing )

07:28.010 --> 07:29.272
HELLO ?

07:29.380 --> 07:30.779
( David )
Rico, where are you ?

07:30.880 --> 07:33.269
UH, I'M AT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE,
WAITING FOR VANESSA.

07:33.380 --> 07:35.109
WELL, WE HAVE THREE
INTAKES THIS MORNING

07:35.220 --> 07:36.369
I NEED YOU HERE.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.117
WELL, I'VE GOT
BOTH KIDS RIGHT NOW.

07:38.220 --> 07:39.118
I'LL BE THERE
AS SOON AS VANESSA'S

07:39.220 --> 07:40.255
DONE WITH
HER APPOINTMENT.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.759
ALRIGHT, FINE.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.521
HEY, DON'T BE GIVING ME
ATTITUDE HERE, DAVID, OKAY ?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.052
VANESSA IS SICK.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.491
I'M SORRY.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.693
JUST GET HERE
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

07:53.270 --> 07:56.398
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE HERE.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.205
I MEAN, IF YOUR JOB
IS MORE IMPORTANT.

07:58.310 --> 08:00.278
YES, I DO,
SHE'S MY WIFE.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.507
AND SHE'S MY SISTER.

08:02.610 --> 08:04.908
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF HER TOO.

08:05.010 --> 08:08.343
MAYBE SHE NEEDS
A LITTLE TIME AWAY FROM YOU,

08:08.450 --> 08:09.849
DID YOU EVER
THINK OF THAT ?

08:09.950 --> 08:11.781
IS MOMMY SICK ?

08:11.890 --> 08:13.915
NO, HONEY,
MOMMY'S NOT SICK.

08:14.020 --> 08:15.908
MOMMY'S JUST FINE.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.721
FIVE MILLIGRAMS OF ATIVAN
TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF

08:19.830 --> 08:21.650
THE 40 MILS
OF CELEXA.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.923
20 MILS OF TRAZEDONE
TO HELP ME SLEEP AT NIGHT,

08:25.030 --> 08:27.931
AND SOMETIMES I TAKE
A LITTLE AMBIEN, TOO--

08:28.040 --> 08:28.768
FIVE MILS.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.804
BUSPAR,
10 MILS A DAY.

08:30.910 --> 08:34.107
OH, YEAH, 300 MILLIGRAMS
OF WELLBUTRIN

08:34.210 --> 08:35.802
TO HELP ME WITH ALL
THE COMPULSIVE EATING.

08:35.910 --> 08:37.275
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN PUTTING ON
A SHITLOAD OF WEIGHT.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.848
WHO PRESCRIBED
ALL THIS MEDICATION ?

08:39.950 --> 08:41.474
MY DOCTOR.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.218
WELL, NOT ALL OF IT.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.880
THE TRAZEDONE, THE ATIVAN
AND THE AMBIEN I GOT ON MY OWN.

08:45.990 --> 08:48.709
BUT IT'S MY FRIEND,
SHE'S AN R.N.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.287
AND SHE KNOWS
ABOUT THIS STUFF.

08:50.390 --> 08:52.119
YOUR DOCTOR,
IS HE A PSYCHIATRIST ?

08:52.230 --> 08:53.822
HE'S AN INTERNIST.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.319
I SEE.

08:56.430 --> 08:58.728
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

08:58.830 --> 09:02.129
WE NEED TO GET YOU OFF
A LOT OF THIS MEDICATION.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.936
SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE TAKING
COULD BE COUNTERACTING

09:05.040 --> 09:09.272
OR EVEN AGGRAVATING
YOUR SYMPTOMS.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.038
SHIT.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.919
I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN A HOLE.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.045
AND I JUST FEEL
LIKE THE HOLE

09:18.150 --> 09:19.651
JUST KEEPS GETTING
DEEPER AND DEEPER.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.489
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

09:21.590 --> 09:25.151
BUT WE'RE GOING
TO TRY TO FIX THAT.

09:26.600 --> 09:31.025
ANTI-DEPRESSANTS AREN'T
MAGIC BULLETS, VANESSA.

09:41.710 --> 09:45.009
DAVID TOLD ME
ABOUT...

09:45.110 --> 09:47.271
LISA.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.584
PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE.

09:51.690 --> 09:53.282
I'LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU.

09:57.590 --> 09:59.023
YES, AND ?

09:59.130 --> 10:01.553
ACCORDING TO STATISTICS COMPILED
BY THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU,

10:01.660 --> 10:04.424
WOMEN ARE THREE TIMES
LESS LIKELY TO DIE

10:04.530 --> 10:06.589
FROM MISADVENTU RE
AS MEN.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.931
I FIND STATISTICS
TO BE COMFORTING

10:10.040 --> 10:13.373
IN TIMES OF STRESS
AND UNCERTAINTY.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.629
UH-HUH.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.832
LISTEN, ARTHUR, I'VE GOT
AN INTAKE RIGHT NOW.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.441
I WAS WONDERING,
MAY I JOIN YOU ?

10:17.550 --> 10:19.199
YOU KNOW ME.

10:19.310 --> 10:21.369
I'M ALWAYS HUNGRY FOR
NEW LEARNING EXPERIENCES.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.847
SURE, WHY NOT ?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.184
WE HAD BEEN
ROBBED BEFORE.

10:32.290 --> 10:34.121
THREE TIMES
IN 10 YEARS.

10:34.230 --> 10:37.597
DOROTHY, SHE WANTED
FOR US TO RETIRE,

10:37.700 --> 10:39.964
BUT I JUST KEPT
PUTTING IT OFF.

10:40.070 --> 10:43.767
MAYBE NEXT YEAR,
MAYBE THE YEAR AI-TER THAT.

10:43.870 --> 10:46.737
AND NOW SHE IS
TAKEN AWAY FROM ME.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.173
HOW CAN SHE
NOT BE HERE ?

10:50.280 --> 10:52.544
ONE MINUTE
SHE'S THERE,

10:52.650 --> 10:56.814
THE NEXT, SHE'S GONE
LIKE SHE WAS NEVER THERE.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.913
WELL, AT LEAST SHE'S
NO LONGER SUFFERING.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.425
SHE HAD CANCER,
RIGHT ?

11:07.530 --> 11:08.554
NO!

11:08.660 --> 11:10.196
SHE WAS SHOT
IN A HOLD-UP !

11:10.300 --> 11:13.292
I AM SO SORRY.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.704
WHAT KIND OF INTERMENT
WERE YOU INTERESTED IN ?

11:23.810 --> 11:27.576
WE HAVE A PLOT
AT FOREST LAWN.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.319
I SEE.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.854
WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOOK AT
OUR LINE OF CASKETS ?

11:32.960 --> 11:36.487
I DON'T HAVE
MUCH MONEY.

11:36.590 --> 11:40.754
I'M SURE WE CAN FIND SOMETHING
TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR BUDGET.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.467
RIGHT.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.526
NATE.

11:46.630 --> 11:49.861
ABSOLUTELY.

11:51.140 --> 11:53.734
ABSOLUTELY.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.007
HE WAS ELECT ROCUTED.

11:56.110 --> 11:58.442
I DON'T WANT MY CHILDREN
TO SEE HIM LIKE THAT.

11:58.550 --> 12:01.542
WELL, WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT
RESTORATIVE ARTIST ON STAFF.

12:01.650 --> 12:04.244
NO, I DON'T WANT MY CHILDREN
TO SEE HIM DEAD.

12:04.350 --> 12:06.511
( doorbell )

12:06.620 --> 12:08.952
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME
FOR JUST A MOMENT.

12:09.060 --> 12:10.925
SURE.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.220
HEY.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.759
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"MISSING" ?

12:21.870 --> 12:23.201
SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE ON HER WAY

12:23.310 --> 12:24.902
TO HER SISTER'S
UP IN SANTA CRUZ.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.978
AND SHE NEVER
GOT THERE.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.504
AW, MAN.

12:30.610 --> 12:34.046
I STILL HAVE A COUPLE CONTACTS
WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

12:34.150 --> 12:36.618
DO YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE SOME CALLS ?

12:36.720 --> 12:38.483
UMM...

12:38.590 --> 12:40.012
NATE'S ALREADY
TALKED TO THEM,

12:40.120 --> 12:42.008
THEY'VE FILED
A MISSING PERSON'S REPORT.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.281
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
FIND ANYTHING ELSE OUT,

12:44.390 --> 12:46.449
YEAH, SURE,
WHY NOT ?

12:48.800 --> 12:50.495
WE NEED TO TALK...

12:50.600 --> 12:52.568
ABOUT US.

12:52.670 --> 12:53.796
I KNOW
AND WE WILL,

12:53.900 --> 12:55.333
BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.206
I HAVE A WOMAN WAITING FOR ME
IN THE PASTORAL ROOM.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.900
OKAY.

13:03.010 --> 13:04.841
I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.440
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
IF I HEAR ANYTHING.

13:06.550 --> 13:08.074
THAN KS.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.723
THIS IS SO
"DAY OF THE LOCUST."

13:19.830 --> 13:21.252
OH, NO LOCUSTS HERE.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.827
COCKROACH ES MAYBE.

13:22.930 --> 13:24.329
BUT NO LOCUSTS.

13:24.430 --> 13:27.888
HERE WE ARE.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.430
NOW, THAT THERE
IS A SLEEPER SOFA.

13:35.540 --> 13:38.441
THEY COME IN VERY HANDY
WHEN YOU HAVE OVERNIGHT GUESTS.

13:38.550 --> 13:41.917
YOU KNOW, LIKE FAMILY,
THAT SORT OF THING.

13:42.020 --> 13:45.148
YOU DO HAVE FAMILY,
DON'T YOU ?

13:45.250 --> 13:47.787
NO, ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE ALL KILLED,

13:47.890 --> 13:49.755
IN A FLOOD.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.487
OH, HONEY,
I'M SORRY.

13:51.590 --> 13:52.955
DON'T BE.

13:53.060 --> 13:55.324
LISTEN, I'LL BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

13:55.430 --> 13:57.967
WE DO HAVE THE OCCASIONAL
BREAK-IN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.197
IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULD SLEEP

14:00.300 --> 14:02.734
WITH A CAN OF PEPPER SPRAY
UNDER MY PILLOW.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.637
YOU KNOW,
JUST IN CASE.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.105
SMELLS LIKE CATS.

14:06.210 --> 14:07.677
OH, WE DON'T
ALLOW PETS.

14:07.780 --> 14:11.079
WE USED TO,
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.670
HOW MUCH ?

14:12.780 --> 14:16.238
$175.00 PER WEEK,
PAYABLE EVERY MONDAY,

14:16.350 --> 14:19.547
AND A TWO-WEEK
SECURITY DEPOSIT.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.988
I'LL TAKE IT.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.395
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

14:30.500 --> 14:34.231
I MADE THIS
FOR YOU.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.867
RUSSELL.

14:37.970 --> 14:42.998
CLAIRE, I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT WHAT HAPPENED

14:43.110 --> 14:45.840
BETWEEN OLIVIER AND ME
WAS TOTALLY FUCKED UP.

14:45.950 --> 14:49.078
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
YOU AND ME

14:49.180 --> 14:50.909
WASN'T FUCKED UP AT ALL.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.080
IT WAS THE OPPOSITE
OF FUCKED UP.

14:54.190 --> 14:58.559
OKAY, WHAT DID HAPPEN
BETWEEN YOU AND OLIVIER ?

14:58.660 --> 14:59.820
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

14:59.930 --> 15:01.295
IT MATTERS TO ME,
DID YOU FUCK HIM ?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.766
WHAT WE DID OR DIDN'T DO
ISN'T IMPORTANT !

15:03.870 --> 15:06.623
WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS THAT I LOVE YOU.

15:06.730 --> 15:09.563
DID HE FUCK YOU ?

15:09.670 --> 15:11.160
I WAS DRUNK !

15:11.270 --> 15:12.669
AND STONED.

15:12.770 --> 15:16.103
AND HE WAS PLAYING
THIS HEAD TRIP ON ME.

15:16.210 --> 15:17.677
I MEAN, YOU KNOW
WHAT HE'S LIKE.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.543
WHAT, YOU LIKE GIVE EACH OTHER
BLOWJOBS OR SOMETHING ?

15:19.650 --> 15:22.312
CLAIRE, I LOVE YOU.

15:22.420 --> 15:23.910
OH, JESUS, RUSSELL !

15:24.020 --> 15:25.419
YOU GAVE EACH OTHER
BLOW JOBS ?

15:25.520 --> 15:26.748
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

15:26.850 --> 15:27.714
WHAT, DID YOU JERK
EACH OTHER OFF, THEN ?

15:27.820 --> 15:28.684
I DIDN'T SAY THAT,
EITHER.

15:28.790 --> 15:29.654
WELL, WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING ?

15:29.760 --> 15:30.988
THAT I LOVE YOU,
OKAY ?

15:31.090 --> 15:33.627
I MEAN, WHY CAN'T
YOU HEAR THAT ?

15:33.730 --> 15:36.893
I MEAN, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
GET OVER YOUR WOUNDED PRIDE

15:37.000 --> 15:39.867
FOR ONE SECOND
AND REALIZE WHAT WE HAVE

15:39.970 --> 15:41.767
IS TOO GOOD FOR YOU
TO TH ROW AWAY ?

15:41.870 --> 15:43.565
OH, FOR ME
TO TH ROW AWAY ?

15:43.670 --> 15:46.434
THAT'S FUNNY,
YOU'RE FUNNY.

15:46.540 --> 15:48.303
AND THAT'S HIDEOUS,
I DON'T WANT I

15:48.410 --> 15:49.434
CLAIRE--

15:49.540 --> 15:50.848
MAYBE YOU CAN SELL IT
TO YOUR FUCKING BOYFRIEND

15:50.950 --> 15:52.770
FOR ANOTHER
$500.00.

15:52.880 --> 15:53.847
I'M SURE YOU
WERE WORTH IT.

15:53.950 --> 15:55.440
I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

15:55.550 --> 15:56.642
I CAN'T.

15:56.750 --> 15:57.682
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.711
I'M NOT GONNA
GIVE UP.

15:58.820 --> 16:00.549
THAT'S YOUR
FUCKING PROBLEM.

16:19.740 --> 16:22.402
( phone ringing )

16:24.980 --> 16:26.607
HELLO.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.416
( Margaret)
Brenda.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.771
HI, MOM.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.519
I HEARD YOU
FREAKED OUT ON BILLY.

16:32.620 --> 16:35.350
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT,
HE'S ON MEDICATION,

16:35.460 --> 16:37.257
AND YOU KNOW HOW
SENSITIVE HE IS.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.089
Is there any other
reason you called ?

16:39.190 --> 16:41.499
BECAUSE IF THIS IS IT,
I'M HANGING UP.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.420
UM...

16:43.530 --> 16:47.364
WELL, WE'RE DISPOSING OF
YOUR FATHER'S ASHES TOMORROW,

16:47.470 --> 16:50.359
AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO BE THERE.

16:50.470 --> 16:56.204
I really don't want to be
around Billy right now.

16:57.310 --> 17:00.768
DARLING, WE OWE IT
TO YOUR FATHER.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.814
DAD'S DEAD,
HE DOESN'T CARE.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.115
WELL, I CARE, OKAY ?

17:05.220 --> 17:07.859
I'D LIKE TO AT LEAST PRETEND
THAT WE ALL LOVE EACH OTHER

17:07.960 --> 17:10.383
and that your father and I
created something worthwhile.

17:10.490 --> 17:12.629
I mean, just for
a fucking hour

17:12.730 --> 17:14.220
HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES
TO DUMP HIS ASHES.

17:14.330 --> 17:17.265
IS THAT TOO MUCH
TO ASK ?

17:18.900 --> 17:20.868
HAVE YOU
DECIDED WHERE ?

17:20.970 --> 17:22.392
NO, NOT YET.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.832
WE'RE ALL MEETING HERE
AROUND 11:30

17:24.940 --> 17:26.009
AND WITH
ANY LUCK AT ALL

17:26.110 --> 17:27.737
THE WHOLE ORDEAL
WILL BE DONE BY TWO.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.400
FINE, I'LL BE THERE.

17:30.510 --> 17:32.569
Okay, bye.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.131
GIVE YOURSELF THE GRADE
YOU THINK YOU DESERVE.

17:59.240 --> 18:03.370
WHAT, IS THAT LIKE PAYING ME
TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT ?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.402
I'M LETTING EVERY STUDENT
GIVE THEMSELVES THEIR OWN GRADE.

18:05.510 --> 18:08.013
WHO AM I TO JUDGE
ANYONE'S WORK ?

18:08.120 --> 18:11.089
OH GOD,
YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.612
YOU CONSTANTLY
CONTRADICT YOURSELF

18:12.720 --> 18:14.256
SO NOTHING YOU SAY
EVER MEANS ANYTHING.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.612
IS MEANING WHAT YOU'RE
REALLY AI-TER, CLAIRE ?

18:16.720 --> 18:19.280
BECAUSE YOUR WORK THIS SEMESTER
WOULD SUGGEST OTHERWISE.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.449
YOUR TECHNIQUE
IS EXCELLENT.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.028
BUT THAT'S ALL IT IS,
TECHNIQUE.

18:24.130 --> 18:26.519
YOUR WORK IS SAFE,
LIMITED.

18:26.630 --> 18:29.565
'CAUSE YOU HOLD
YOURSELF BACK FROM LIFE.

18:29.670 --> 18:34.175
WELL, CALL ME CRAZY,
BUT I THINK AN ARTIST

18:34.280 --> 18:36.236
HAS A RESPONSIBILITY
TO DO MORE THAN JUST

18:36.340 --> 18:38.001
GIVE IN TO EVERY
EMOTIONAL IMPULSE,

18:38.110 --> 18:40.749
BECAUSE SOME IMPULSES
ARE WRONG,

18:40.850 --> 18:44.047
AND SOME IMPULSES VIOLATE
THE REGULATIONS OF THIS SCHOOL.

18:44.150 --> 18:45.481
I CHECKED.

18:45.590 --> 18:48.252
EXACTLY HOW MANY SCHOOLS
HAVE YOU TAUGHT AT, OLIVIER ?

18:48.360 --> 18:52.581
YOU SIT IN SUCH
JUDGMENT OF THE WORLD.

18:52.690 --> 18:55.250
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO EVER BE A PART OF IT ?

18:55.360 --> 18:56.657
I DON'T WANT TO BE
A PART OF YOUR WORLD.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.421
WHERE YOU GET TO BE
A TOTALLY MANIPULATIVE LOSER

18:58.530 --> 19:00.168
WHO FUCKS
HIS STUDENTS.

19:00.270 --> 19:02.488
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO BE, CLAIRE, HUH ?

19:02.600 --> 19:05.364
AN UPTIGHT PURITAN WHO'S
NOT EVEN IN HER OWN BODY,

19:05.470 --> 19:07.335
OR A BRILLIANT ARTIST

19:07.440 --> 19:10.375
WITH BLOOD AND A HEART
AND A CUNT ?!

19:10.480 --> 19:15.349
GOD, YOU'RE SUCH
A FUCKING PHONY.

19:15.450 --> 19:17.589
YOU KNOW, AT FIRST,
YOU ACTUALLY INSPIRED ME.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.147
IT TOOK ME LIKE
HALF A SEMESTER TO REALIZE

19:20.260 --> 19:21.557
THAT YOU WERE
JUST LIKE USING US

19:21.660 --> 19:23.321
TO WORK THROUGH
YOUR OWN PERSONAL SHIT.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.648
I MEAN, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA GET OVER THE FACT

19:25.760 --> 19:27.751
THAT YOU NEVER BECAME PICASSO
AND NOW IT'S TOO FUCKING LATE ?!

19:27.860 --> 19:29.999
AND WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO GET OVER THE FACT

19:30.100 --> 19:31.328
THAT IF YOU
TAKE A CHANCE

19:31.430 --> 19:33.261
YOU MIGHT FALL
FLAT ON YOUR FACE.

19:33.370 --> 19:35.031
BUT THAT'S THE BEST THING
THAT CAN EVER HAPPEN TO YOU,

19:35.140 --> 19:38.029
AS AN ARTIST
AND AS A HUMAN BEING ?

19:38.140 --> 19:40.005
ARE WE DONE ?

19:40.110 --> 19:42.032
ABSOLUTELY,
GET OUT OF MY OFFICE.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.005
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE, THE POPE ?

19:44.110 --> 19:45.998
JUST BECAUSE I FUCKED
YOUR BOYFRIEND ?

19:46.110 --> 19:48.613
WHAT A BABY.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.142
YOU NEED SOME REAL PAIN,
IS WHAT YOU NEED.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.081
FUCK YOU.

19:52.190 --> 19:53.452
FUCK YOURSELF.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.381
RUSSELL WILL ALWAYS BE
A BETTER ARTIST THAN YOU.

19:56.490 --> 19:58.629
HE'S BRAVER, MORE WILLING
TO TAKE CHANCES.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.426
WELL, HE'S CERTAINLY
MORE AM BITIOUS,

20:01.530 --> 20:03.088
THAT SEEMS
PRETTY OBVIOUS.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.020
WELL, IF IT HADN'T BEEN ME,
IT WOULD'VE BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE,

20:05.130 --> 20:06.165
TRUST ME.

20:06.270 --> 20:07.532
I'LL TAKE AN "A".

20:07.640 --> 20:08.766
UNDESERVED.

20:08.870 --> 20:10.804
UNIMPORTANT.

20:14.510 --> 20:15.704
YEAH, I KNOW
I'VE ALREADY--

20:15.810 --> 20:16.799
I'VE BEEN CALL--

20:16.910 --> 20:18.571
WELL, MY WIFE
IS STILL MISSING

20:18.680 --> 20:22.309
AND I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANYONE
TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY !

20:24.720 --> 20:26.187
YES.

20:26.290 --> 20:28.815
NO, I HAVE CALLED BOTH
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

20:28.920 --> 20:30.080
AND THE HIGHWAY PATROL.

20:30.190 --> 20:33.421
YES, I SPOKE WITH
OFFICER POLK.

20:34.230 --> 20:35.788
YES, GO AHEAD.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.323
THANK YOU.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.638
YES, I KNOW,
THANK YOU.

20:42.740 --> 20:46.938
NO, I WILL CALL BACK
IN A FEW HOURS.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.598
ANY NEWS ?

20:48.710 --> 20:50.302
NO.

20:50.410 --> 20:52.549
I'M GONNA TAKE
MAYA TO THE PARK.

20:52.650 --> 20:54.015
GREAT.

20:54.120 --> 20:58.011
NATE, DEAR, EVERYTHING IS
GONNA BE FINE, YOU'LL SEE.

20:58.120 --> 21:02.659
I MADE SOME APPLE CRUMBLE,
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A PIECE ?

21:11.830 --> 21:14.867
( sighing )

21:14.970 --> 21:17.165
HERE'S THE GENTLEMAN WHO
PASSED AWAY AT THE HEALTH CLUB.

21:17.270 --> 21:18.828
WHAT SHOULD
I DO WITH HIM ?

21:18.940 --> 21:21.579
UH, PUT HIM
IN THE REEFER.

21:21.680 --> 21:26.549
I BELIEVE THAT THE REFRIGERATOR
IS ALREADY FULL.

21:26.650 --> 21:28.675
THEN YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO LEAVE HIM OUT, WON'T YOU ?

21:28.780 --> 21:31.112
( Arthur )
BUT THAT WOULD BE
A CODE VIOLATION.

21:31.220 --> 21:33.211
WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO RUN THE RISK.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.584
AS LONG AS YOU BOTH
UNDERSTAND THAT--

21:35.690 --> 21:38.727
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE,
ARTHUR, WE ARE.

21:42.430 --> 21:45.627
PERHAPS I COULD JUST TRY
AND MAKE A LITTLE ROOM FOR--

21:45.730 --> 21:47.436
JUST STOP
FUCKING WHINING

21:47.540 --> 21:49.758
AND GET THE HELL OUT
OF HERE ALREADY, OKAY ?!

21:51.240 --> 21:53.060
OKAY.

21:57.110 --> 21:58.407
YOU ALRIGHT ?

21:58.510 --> 22:00.944
NOT ESPECIALLY.

22:03.850 --> 22:05.408
THERE ANYTHING YOU'D
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ?

22:05.520 --> 22:07.454
DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW,

22:07.560 --> 22:09.312
OR ARE YOU JUST
BEING POLITE ?

22:11.890 --> 22:14.950
I ASKED,
DIDN'T I ?

22:17.300 --> 22:19.598
MY WIFE IS
CLINICALLY DEPRESSED.

22:19.700 --> 22:22.533
ON TOP OF THAT,
MY SISTER-IN-LAW,

22:22.640 --> 22:24.904
WHO, LET'S JUST SAY I HAVE
PROBLEMS WITH ON A GOOD DAY,

22:25.010 --> 22:26.204
IS AT MY HOUSE,

22:26.310 --> 22:28.175
TAKING CARE OF HER,
RIGHT NOW.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.907
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

22:30.010 --> 22:31.773
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

22:31.880 --> 22:34.713
THESE ELECT ROCUTION BURNS
ARE A SERIOUS BITCH.

22:37.020 --> 22:39.113
( door closing )

22:42.720 --> 22:45.029
HAS ANYBODY HEARD
FROM LISA YET ?

22:45.130 --> 22:46.654
NOT YET, NO.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.957
I'M SURE IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.499
A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE WHAT ?

22:54.600 --> 22:56.363
BEFORE SHE CALLS
AND TELLS US

22:56.470 --> 22:58.700
SHE'S HAD A LITTLE
CAR TROUBLE OR--

22:58.810 --> 23:00.732
I DON'T KNOW,
THAT SHE'S OKAY.

23:00.840 --> 23:05.277
NO ONE IN THIS FAMILY
EVER TALKS ABOUT
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

23:05.380 --> 23:07.519
WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN ?

23:07.620 --> 23:09.144
MOM, WE HAVE
TO FACE THINGS.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.286
WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE POSSIBILITY

23:11.390 --> 23:13.142
THAT SOMETHING BAD
HAS PROBABLY HAPPENED.

23:13.250 --> 23:14.581
WE DO NOT !

23:14.690 --> 23:16.851
YOU MAY NOT
BELIEVE THIS, CLAIRE,

23:16.960 --> 23:19.178
BUT I HAVE A LOT MORE
LIFE EXPERIENCE THAN YOU,

23:19.290 --> 23:20.621
AND AT TIMES
LIKE THIS,

23:20.730 --> 23:22.322
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
WE KEEP A POSITIVE ATTITUDE.

23:22.430 --> 23:25.888
WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS
BE SO NEGATIVE ?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.537
WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS BE
IN SUCH DEEP DENIAL ?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.039
I AM NOT IN DENIAL !

23:30.140 --> 23:34.577
MOM, I'M JUST TRYING
TO PREPARE FOR THE WORST.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.501
SO, THAT WHEN IT ACTUALLY
HAPPENS, IT'S NOT SO AWFUL.

23:37.610 --> 23:38.941
WELL, DON'T !

23:39.050 --> 23:41.610
LISA IS GOING TO TURN UP
AND SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE

23:41.720 --> 23:45.144
AND THERE WILL BE A LOGICAL
EXPLANATION FOR ALL OF THIS !

23:45.250 --> 23:48.913
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:49.020 --> 23:52.228
AND THEY'RE GONNA PUT
AN END TO WORLD HUNGER

23:52.330 --> 23:54.719
AND PEOPLE WILL STOP
KILLING EACH OTHER

23:54.830 --> 23:58.095
AND THE OIL COMPANIES ARE
GONNA STOP RUNNING EVERYTHING

23:58.200 --> 23:59.724
AND APOLOGIZE
FOR GLOBAL WARMING.

23:59.830 --> 24:02.037
I'M SURE IT'S JUST
A MATTER OF TIME.

24:07.170 --> 24:09.707
(vomiting )

24:23.420 --> 24:25.388
( Keith )
OKAY, WHEN YOU TALKED TO HER,
SHE SAID SHE WAS AT THE OCEAN.

24:25.490 --> 24:27.151
DID SHE SAY WHERE ?

24:27.260 --> 24:28.591
NO.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.565
SHE JUST SAID
IT LOOKED NICE.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.661
HOW LONG HAD
SHE BEEN GONE ?

24:32.770 --> 24:35.091
UM, I DON'T KNOW,
TWO, MAYBE THREE HOURS ?

24:35.200 --> 24:41.230
LONG ENOUGH TO
SWITCH TO HIGHWAY ONE
AT SAN LUIS OBISPO ?

24:41.340 --> 24:43.706
YEAH, MAYBE.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.506
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT PROBABLY NOT.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.713
SHE'S NOT THE WORLD'S
FASTEST DRIVER.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.117
WHY WOULDN'T SHE JUST
STAY ON THE 101 ?

24:49.220 --> 24:51.040
BECAUSE SHE WANTED
TO DRIVE THROUGH BIG SUR.

24:51.150 --> 24:53.914
SHE LOVES BIG SUR.

24:54.020 --> 24:57.080
DID YOU CONTACT
THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY ?

24:58.890 --> 25:01.154
TO SEE WHERE SHE MAY HAVE
STOPPED TO GET GAS, RIGHT ?

25:01.260 --> 25:02.921
OR LUNCH,
OR A MOTEL ROOM,

25:03.030 --> 25:04.588
ANY PURCHASES
THAT MIGHT INDICATE

25:04.700 --> 25:06.190
THAT THE CARD'S
BEEN STOLEN.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.528
I SHOULD DTHAT
RIGHT NOW.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.891
( phone ringing )

25:09.000 --> 25:10.262
HELLO.

25:10.370 --> 25:12.338
HEY NATE,
IT'S ME, BRENDA.

25:12.440 --> 25:16.035
Listen, I just wanted to call
and apologize for last night.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.846
I was really out of line--

25:17.950 --> 25:20.748
LOOK, BRENDA, I CAN'T TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW, OKAY ?

25:20.850 --> 25:23.785
I'VE GOT A LOT MORE
IMPORTANT SHIT TO DEAL WITH.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.084
FUCK !

25:32.960 --> 25:35.019
YEAH, FUCKIN',
COME ON !

25:35.130 --> 25:38.019
I'M ALREADY ON HOLD.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.337
I GUESS
I'M GONNA GET GOING.

25:45.440 --> 25:49.501
I'M GONNA STAY HERE.

25:49.610 --> 25:51.805
OKAY.

25:53.650 --> 25:54.776
I'LL CALL YOU
TOMORROW ?

25:54.880 --> 25:57.269
OR SOONER IF
YOU HEAR ANYTHING.

26:12.530 --> 26:15.135
Everyone's feeling
a little bit shalq.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.267
OKAY, SO, WE KNOW THAT
SHE STOPPED FOR GAS

26:19.370 --> 26:20.598
IN SANTA BARBARA.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.838
BUT THAT WAS
YESTERDAY.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.747
DO YOU THINK SHE'D HAVE REASON
TO USE THE CARD AGAIN SOMETIME

26:25.850 --> 26:27.772
BETWEEN THEN
AND NOW, RIGHT ?

26:27.880 --> 26:29.848
UNLESS SHE HAD
A LOT OF CASH ON HER.

26:29.950 --> 26:33.818
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
A LOT OF CASH ON HER.

26:33.920 --> 26:39.051
AT LEAST I DON'T
THINK SHE DID.

26:39.160 --> 26:42.220
LISTEN, I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.222
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU AND KEITH ?

26:48.400 --> 26:50.061
NOTHING MUCH.

26:50.170 --> 26:53.731
YOU GUYS SEEMED
A LITTLE TENSE TONIGHT.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.479
YOU THINK
WE WERE TENSE ?

26:56.580 --> 26:59.970
YEAH.

27:00.650 --> 27:02.777
I GUESS WE ARE.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.085
I DON'T KNOW.

27:05.190 --> 27:06.543
WE HAD THIS BIG FIGHT
DOWN IN SAN DIEGO

27:06.650 --> 27:08.186
IN FRONT OF HIS
MOM AND DAD.

27:08.290 --> 27:10.383
I BUTTED IN.

27:10.490 --> 27:12.526
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.121
NOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE ARE.

27:15.230 --> 27:18.597
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

27:18.700 --> 27:22.329
AT LEAST
I THINK WE DO.

27:23.910 --> 27:27.778
LATELY, THOUGH,
I JUST FEEL NUMB

27:27.880 --> 27:29.677
WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER.

27:29.780 --> 27:31.975
BETTER WHEN WE'RE NOT.

27:32.080 --> 27:36.471
IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T
WANT THE SAME THINGS, WE DO.

27:36.580 --> 27:38.810
I THINK.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.182
MAYBE WE DON'T WANT
THE SAME THINGS

27:40.290 --> 27:42.986
MAYBE WE'RE JUST
PRETENDING THAT WE DO.

27:45.130 --> 27:50.124
MAYBE WE'RE JUST NOT
MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

28:04.810 --> 28:08.109
( tv chatter )

28:18.890 --> 28:20.687
( door opening )

28:20.800 --> 28:25.499
HEY, SWEETIE.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.296
HI, MY LOVE.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.628
HEY.

28:29.740 --> 28:31.503
WHERE THE FUCK
HAVE YOU BEEN ?

28:31.610 --> 28:32.907
NATE--

28:33.010 --> 28:34.773
DO YOU KNOW HOW
WORRIED I'VE BEEN ?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.233
HOW WORRIED
WE'VE ALL BEEN ?

28:36.340 --> 28:40.049
LISA, I FILED A FUCKING
MISSING PERSON'S REPORT ON YOU !

28:40.150 --> 28:42.675
OH MY GOD,
I'M SO SORRY.

28:42.780 --> 28:44.987
WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T YOU
AT LEAST CALL ME ?

28:45.090 --> 28:47.411
I MUST'VE LEI-T
A HUNDRED FUCKING MESSAGES

28:47.520 --> 28:48.919
FOR YOU ON
YOUR CELL PHONE !

28:49.020 --> 28:51.386
GOD, I MUST HAVE TURNED IT OFF
AFTER I CALLED YOU.

28:51.490 --> 28:53.048
JESUS CHRIST, LISA !

28:53.160 --> 28:57.096
JESUS CHRIST !

28:57.200 --> 28:59.725
DON'T EVER FUCKING
DO THAT AGAIN.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.899
( sobbing )

29:22.820 --> 29:24.458
HEY, COME HERE.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.755
OH YEAH.

29:31.330 --> 29:32.661
HEY.

29:32.770 --> 29:35.739
DID SHE CALL ?

29:35.840 --> 29:38.559
NO, LOOK, CAN YOU
WATCH MAYA FOR ME ?

29:38.670 --> 29:40.433
JUST FOR
A LITTLE WHILE.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.303
I NEED TO GO
GET SOME AIR.

29:42.410 --> 29:43.399
OKAY.

29:43.510 --> 29:45.102
HERE YOU GO.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.947
HEY.

29:50.050 --> 29:52.883
HEY.

30:27.790 --> 30:30.281
NATE.

30:34.730 --> 30:35.628
HELLO ?

30:35.730 --> 30:36.822
SPEAKING.

30:36.930 --> 30:38.625
YOU WHAT ?

30:38.730 --> 30:39.628
WHERE ?

30:39.730 --> 30:41.266
YES !

30:41.370 --> 30:44.237
YES, I'M ON MY WAY.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.904
THEY FOUND HER CAR.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.075
IT'S TOTALLY COOL.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.319
THE STREETS ARE
KIND OF OLD-TIMEY,

30:55.420 --> 30:57.911
AND THERE'S AN ANTHROPOLOGIE
AND A NIKE GODDESS

30:58.020 --> 31:00.386
AND EVERYTHING IS
AS CLEAN AS DISNEYLAND,

31:00.490 --> 31:01.616
EVEN THE BATHROOMS.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.210
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT ?

31:03.320 --> 31:05.629
ABOUT THE NEW SHOPPING MALL
OVER BY THE FARMER'S MARKET.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.027
THE GROVE.

31:07.130 --> 31:08.290
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE
HAVEN'T BEEN THERE YET.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.494
HEY, THERE'S
A DANCE LESSON TONIGHT.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.862
YOU FEEL UP TO IT ?

31:12.970 --> 31:14.665
I DON'T KNOW.

31:14.770 --> 31:16.067
BUT MAYBE ?

31:16.170 --> 31:19.401
WELL, IF WE'RE GONNA CANCEL,
WE SHOULD LET THEM KNOW,

31:19.510 --> 31:20.863
OTHERWISE THEY'RE
GONNA CHARGE US ANYWAY.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.834
CAN WE DECIDE LATER ?

31:22.940 --> 31:25.579
YEAH, JUST CALL ME
AT WORK AFTER LUNCH.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.806
OKAY, I WILL.

31:26.910 --> 31:28.070
OKAY.

31:28.180 --> 31:31.946
OH, RICO, I NEED
THE CREDIT CARD.

31:32.050 --> 31:33.915
YEAH, WHAT FOR ?

31:34.020 --> 31:35.385
I'M TAKING HER
SHOPPING.

31:35.490 --> 31:37.458
A LITTLE SHOPPING
IS GOOD FOR DEPRESSION.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.154
YOU WANT
TO GO SHOPPING.

31:40.260 --> 31:41.454
YEAH, I THINK
IT'LL BE FUN.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.198
WE'RE JUST GONNA GET HER
A NEW PAIR OF SHOES.

31:43.300 --> 31:46.622
AND MAYBE SOME LUNCH
AT THE FARMER'S MARKET.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.391
PLEASE ?

31:48.500 --> 31:50.639
YEAH, OF COURSE.

31:50.740 --> 31:52.765
HERE.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.338
THANK YOU, BABY.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.872
WELL, WHERE DID HE
WANT HIS ASHES SPREAD ?

32:01.980 --> 32:05.188
HE TOLD ME
TO SURPRISE HIM.

32:06.890 --> 32:08.983
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE HIM
OUT TO CATALINA.

32:09.090 --> 32:12.548
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU
NEED A PERMIT FOR THAT.

32:12.660 --> 32:17.097
SO, I PUT HIM IN MY BACKPACK
AND NO ONE'S THE WISER.

32:21.500 --> 32:24.731
ARE YOU TWO NOT
SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER ?

32:24.840 --> 32:26.205
BECAUSE IF THAT'S
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

32:26.310 --> 32:27.629
IT'S REALLY STARTING
TO AN NOY ME.

32:27.740 --> 32:28.968
I'M SPEAKING.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.502
LET'S JUST DO THIS
SO I CAN GO.

32:30.610 --> 32:31.804
OKAY, WHATEVER,

32:31.910 --> 32:33.275
BUT I AM NOT GOING ALL
THE WAY OUT TO CATALINA

32:33.380 --> 32:35.848
IN SOME GODDAMNED BOAT JUST
BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE ONCE

32:35.950 --> 32:38.009
WHEN YOU WERE 12.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.314
WHAT ABOUT
THE BEACH IN MALIBU ?

32:39.420 --> 32:41.615
NO, THAT'S WHERE EVERYONE
THROWS THEIR ASHES.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.119
SO?

32:43.220 --> 32:45.654
I DON'T WANT HIM CO-MINGLING
WITH TOTAL STRANGERS.

32:45.760 --> 32:50.424
OKAY, WE DRIVE HIM UP INTO
ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST

32:50.530 --> 32:51.758
AND PLANT A TREE.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.667
PLANT A TREE ?

32:53.770 --> 32:55.192
OH, YOU MUST BE KIDDING.

32:55.300 --> 32:58.906
THEN I SAY
WE DRIVE HIM TO MALIBU.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.399
NO, I'M NOT GOING
ALL THE WAY OUT TO MALIBU,

33:01.510 --> 33:03.899
BESIDES, THE TRAFFIC WILL
KILL US ON THE WAY BACK.

33:04.010 --> 33:07.502
THIS IS GIVING ME SUCH
A GODDAMNED HEADACHE.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.271
WELL.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.245
FUCK IT.

33:24.030 --> 33:25.327
THERE.

33:25.430 --> 33:29.992
NOW, HE'LL BE IN WESTWOOD
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

33:52.590 --> 33:54.592
( knocking )

33:54.700 --> 33:55.997
WHAT ?

33:56.100 --> 33:57.522
( David )
WE NEED YOUR HELP,
CLAIRE.

33:57.630 --> 34:00.519
WELL, I'M KIND OF RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE OF SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

34:00.630 --> 34:02.791
WELL, HURRY IT UP.

34:13.810 --> 34:15.368
ALRIGHT.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.016
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO ?

34:17.120 --> 34:18.246
JUST GIVE THESE
TO PEOPLE

34:18.350 --> 34:19.317
AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE
HERE TO SEE MRS. SU.

34:19.420 --> 34:22.685
YOU NEED HELP
FOR THAT ?

34:22.790 --> 34:24.553
YES.

34:24.660 --> 34:26.582
AND SMILE.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.055
NOT TOO MUCH.

34:28.160 --> 34:29.354
COM PASSIONATE,
BUT NOT HAPPY.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.428
THAT SHOULD BE
NO PROBLEM.

34:31.530 --> 34:33.725
MRS. SU ?

34:33.830 --> 34:36.765
MR. TU LLY.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.107
OH, UH,
HE'S IN THERE.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.543
WHAT'S UP
WITH YOU ?

34:44.650 --> 34:46.299
NOTHING'S UP
WITH ME.

34:46.410 --> 34:48.640
AM I NOT ALLOWED
TO BE IN A BAD MOOD ?

34:48.750 --> 34:51.947
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.189
MY BOYFRIEND HAD SEX
WITH ANOTHER GUY

34:54.290 --> 34:55.655
AND WE BROKE UP, OKAY ?

34:55.760 --> 34:56.681
ARE YOU HAPPY ?

34:56.790 --> 34:58.655
CLAIRE,
I'M SO SORRY.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.988
WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU PEOPLE ?

35:00.090 --> 35:01.557
YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN,

35:01.660 --> 35:03.753
SO, YOU'VE GOT TO STRING
ALONG GIRLS LIKE ME TO,

35:03.860 --> 35:07.068
WHAT, EASE
THE TRANSITION ?

35:07.170 --> 35:09.798
MRS. SU,
OR MR. TULLY ?

35:09.900 --> 35:11.231
MRS. SU, PLEASE.

35:11.340 --> 35:13.433
RIGHT THROUGH HERE.

35:13.540 --> 35:18.148
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY BEST YOU
FOUND OUT ABOUT RUSSELL NOW,

35:18.250 --> 35:20.070
BEFORE IT WENT
ANY FURTHER.

35:20.180 --> 35:21.477
OH, YEAH.

35:21.580 --> 35:24.185
THE TIMING OF ALL THIS IS
JUST SO FUCKING PERFECT

35:24.290 --> 35:25.587
IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.

35:25.690 --> 35:26.440
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

35:26.550 --> 35:31.283
WITH WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH LISA.

35:31.390 --> 35:34.723
AND LIKE HOW TERRIBLE THINGS
ALWAYS HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME.

35:34.830 --> 35:38.527
LIKE WHEN CELEBRITIES DIE
IN SETS OF THREE.

35:39.130 --> 35:40.461
MRS. SU ?

35:40.570 --> 35:41.264
YES.

35:41.370 --> 35:42.530
RIGHT THIS WAY.

35:42.640 --> 35:47.009
YOU DON'T THINK LISA
MIGHT HAVE ?

35:47.110 --> 35:48.975
WHAT, OFFED HERSELF ?

35:49.080 --> 35:50.399
NO WAY.

35:50.510 --> 35:52.068
I DON'T KNOW,
THINGS SEEMED PRETTY TENSE

35:52.180 --> 35:53.875
BETWEEN HER AND NATE
FOR A WHILE THERE,

35:53.980 --> 35:56.540
AND SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT,
YOU OW, WEIRD LOOK IN HER EYE.

35:56.650 --> 35:58.345
LIKE IT REALLY
WOULDN'T TAKE THAT MUCH

35:58.450 --> 35:59.747
TO SEND HER
OVER THE EDGE.

35:59.850 --> 36:01.681
THERE'S NO WAY THAT LISA
WOULD DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

36:01.790 --> 36:03.587
NOT WITH THE BABY.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.160
HOW WE DOING ?

36:16.270 --> 36:17.464
SO FAR SO GOOD.

36:17.570 --> 36:19.800
BUT WE'VE ONLY GOT
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR,

36:19.910 --> 36:23.471
AN HOUR TOPS TO GET THE SUS'
OUT OF THE PASTORAL ROOM

36:23.580 --> 36:25.207
SO WE CAN GET
MR. MONROE IN THERE.

36:25.310 --> 36:27.778
GOODNESS, WE'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE IT.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.040
OF COURSE
WE WILL, ARTHUR.

36:29.150 --> 36:30.242
WE DON'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

36:30.350 --> 36:33.513
YOU MUST BE HERE
FOR EDWARD TULLY ?

36:33.620 --> 36:36.817
NO, I'M HERE
FOR DOROTHY SU.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.024
AM I IN
THE WRONG PLACE ?

36:39.130 --> 36:40.449
OVER THERE.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.699
I PARKED ON THE STREET
RIGHT IN FRONT,

36:42.800 --> 36:45.189
I'M NOT GONNA GET
A TICKET THERE, AM I ?

36:45.300 --> 36:46.858
YOU SHOULD BE FINE.

36:46.970 --> 36:49.188
THANK YOU.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.433
BUT HE COULD
GET A TICKET.

36:52.540 --> 36:54.235
IT'LL TAKE HIM TOO LONG
TO MOVE HIS CAR !

36:54.340 --> 36:56.570
WHEN WE'RE IN THE WEEDS
THE WAY WE ARE TODAY, ARTHUR,

36:56.680 --> 36:58.944
YOU JUST GOTTA MOVE 'EM IN
AND MOVE 'EM OUT.

37:00.210 --> 37:01.711
NO, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.048
THIS IS
MY WIFE'S CAR.

37:03.150 --> 37:05.186
SHE DIDN JUST
LEAVE IT HERE

37:05.290 --> 37:06.587
AND DISAPPEAR OFF THE FACE
OF THE FUCKIN' EARTH.

37:06.690 --> 37:09.318
LOOK, THERE'S HER CELL PHONE
AND HER WALLET.

37:09.420 --> 37:10.819
THEY'RE BOTH STILL
IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.888
AND THERE'S HER OVERNIGHT BAG,
BUT HER BACKPACK IS MISSING.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.150
AND YOU CHECKED
THE TRUNK.

37:14.260 --> 37:15.454
YEAH, I CHECKED THE TRUNK,
IT'S NOT IN THERE.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.120
AND ALSO LISA DOESN'T
DRINK DR. PEPPER, OKAY ?

37:18.230 --> 37:19.822
SHE DOESN'T DRINK
SODA AT ALL.

37:19.930 --> 37:20.862
SHE THINKS
IT'S TOXIC.

37:20.970 --> 37:22.460
HEY, I'M SORRY, MR.--

37:22.570 --> 37:23.867
FISHER.

37:23.970 --> 37:26.234
MR. FISHER, WE'VE GOT A
MISSING PERSONS REPORT ON FILE.

37:26.340 --> 37:29.207
A MISSING BACKPACK
AND A CAN OF DR. PEPPER

37:29.310 --> 37:31.642
DOES NOT QUALIFY
AS EVIDENCE OF FOUL PLAY.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.672
D WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE
OF FOUL PLAY,

37:33.780 --> 37:36.112
WE CAN'T TREAT THIS AS ANYTHING
MORE THAN IT APPEARS TO BE:

37:36.220 --> 37:37.778
A MISSING PERSONS CASE.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.281
I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND
THAT THERE'S NOTHING

37:41.390 --> 37:42.516
TO WORRY ABOUT HERE.

37:42.620 --> 37:43.757
QUITE POSSIBLY
THERE IS.

37:43.860 --> 37:44.884
YEAH, MY WIFE IS
FUCKING MISSING !

37:44.990 --> 37:46.252
I UNDERSTAND THAT, SIR.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.294
AND I CAN SEE THAT YOU
ARE GENUINELY DISTRESSED.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.493
BUT AT THIS POINT, THERE
ISN'T A WHOLE LOT I CAN DO.

37:50.600 --> 37:55.333
LOOK, IF IT WERE ME,
I'D STICK AROUND THE AREA

37:55.440 --> 37:57.169
IN CASE SHE FINDS HER WAY
BACK TO PICK UP HER CAR.

37:57.270 --> 37:58.806
THERE'S A MOTEL
JUST UP THE WAY.

37:58.910 --> 38:02.801
I WOULD MAKE SURE TO MOVE IT
BY THIS TIME TOMORROW THOUGH,

38:02.910 --> 38:05.401
UNLESS YOU WANT IT TOWED
TO THE IMPOUND LOT.

38:08.380 --> 38:12.646
* STRUMMING MY PAIN
WITH HIS FINGERS *

38:12.750 --> 38:17.653
* SINGING MY LIFE
WITH HIS WORDS *

38:17.760 --> 38:22.322
* KILLING ME SOl-TLY
WITH HIS SONG... *

38:22.430 --> 38:25.558
MY GOD, HOW LONG IS SHE
GONNA GO ON LIKE THIS ?

38:25.670 --> 38:30.460
WITH ANY LUCK SHE'LL THROW
HERSELF OVER THE RAILING.

38:33.040 --> 38:37.033
OKAY, TELL ROBERTA FLACK
I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.038
BRENDA,
WE HAVE TO TALK.

38:38.140 --> 38:38.902
NO, WE DON'T.

38:39.010 --> 38:40.170
WE DO.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.076
WHAT IS THERE
TO SAY, BILLY ?

38:41.180 --> 38:41.976
WHAT ?

38:42.080 --> 38:43.069
I'M IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

38:43.180 --> 38:44.886
OH, JESUS, DON'T !

38:44.990 --> 38:45.843
NO, I NEED TO SAY IT.

38:45.950 --> 38:49.556
I NEED TO SAY IT.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.622
I KNOW
I CAN'T HAVE YOU.

38:53.730 --> 38:59.066
I KNOW IT'S WRONG
TO WANT YOU LIKE THIS.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.161
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT ANY LESS TRUE.

39:01.270 --> 39:05.730
AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THAT ?

39:05.840 --> 39:07.137
NOTHING.

39:07.240 --> 39:10.004
NOTHING,
I HAVE TO...

39:10.110 --> 39:12.408
LET IT GO.

39:12.510 --> 39:18.483
AND MAYBE SAYING
THE WORDS WILL HELP.

39:20.990 --> 39:23.015
I WANT TO LET GO.

39:26.190 --> 39:29.990
YOU HAVE
TO BELIEVE THAT.

39:38.340 --> 39:41.798
( Margaret)
* STRUMMING MY PAIN...

39:41.910 --> 39:43.798
I JUST HAVE
A FEELING ABOUT THIS.

39:43.910 --> 39:46.208
AND EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO BE ALRIGHT.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.776
MOM, THEY FOUND
HER CAR.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.144
THERE ARE 100 EXPLANATIONS
FOR THAT,

39:53.250 --> 39:54.478
SHE COULD'VE
RUN OUT OF GAS.

39:54.590 --> 39:57.957
SHE HAS A TRIPLE-A CARD,
SHE HAS A CELL PHONE.

39:58.060 --> 39:59.288
SHE WOULD HAVE CALLED.

39:59.390 --> 40:00.550
I TOLD YOU, MAYBE
THE BATTERY WENT DEAD.

40:00.660 --> 40:02.218
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE PREPARED--

40:02.330 --> 40:03.627
I AM SICK OF
HEARING THAT !

40:03.730 --> 40:05.163
I WILL NOT
BE PREPARED !

40:05.270 --> 40:06.669
AND NEITHER SHOULD
ANYONE ELSE !

40:06.770 --> 40:09.398
I REFUSE TO BELIEVE
THAT ANYTHING IS WRONG !

40:09.500 --> 40:13.334
I HAVE TO TRUST
MY FEELINGS.

40:13.440 --> 40:17.809
RIGHT NOW
THEY'RE ALL I HAVE.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.990
Just where do you
think you're going ?

40:36.100 --> 40:39.160
To relax in my study
with a nice cup of tea,

40:39.270 --> 40:40.726
my succulent compart.

40:40.830 --> 40:44.561
You may have some tea later
after you ﬁnd those rats !

40:44.670 --> 40:46.035
WHAT THE HELL
IS ALL OF THIS ?

40:46.140 --> 40:47.903
WHAT ?

40:48.010 --> 40:49.432
AH, THE TV.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.599
A REFRIGERATOR ?

40:51.710 --> 40:55.077
OH, OKAY, THE DELIVERY GUYS
COULDN'T GET THE REFRIGERATOR

40:55.180 --> 40:56.977
THROUGH THE KITCHEN DOOR,

40:57.080 --> 40:59.219
SO, THEY SAID YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO TAKE OUT

40:59.320 --> 41:00.287
THOSE OLD CABINETS
OUT FIRST.

41:00.390 --> 41:01.482
OH, MY GOD.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.057
OH, MY GOD.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.821
OKAY.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.921
UH, JULIO, C'MON.

41:07.030 --> 41:09.248
GET YOUR BROTHER.

41:09.360 --> 41:10.349
C'MON, PAPA.

41:10.460 --> 41:12.724
LET'S GO IN
THE OTHER ROOM, OKAY ?

41:15.670 --> 41:18.138
WHERE'S VANESSA ?

41:18.240 --> 41:19.400
SHE'S ASLEEP.

41:19.510 --> 41:21.068
WE HAVE A DANCE LESSON
TONIGHT.

41:21.170 --> 41:22.603
WELL, YOU CAN WAKE
HER UP IF YOU WANT TO.

41:22.710 --> 41:25.747
BUT IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULD LET HER SLEEP.

41:27.810 --> 41:29.675
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
TAKING HER SHOPPING

41:29.780 --> 41:30.917
FOR A NEW PAIR
OF SHOES.

41:31.020 --> 41:33.147
UH, DON'T START
WITH ME, RICO.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.512
WE CANNOT AFFORD
THIS SHIT !

41:34.620 --> 41:35.780
OH, BULLSHIT, RICO.

41:35.890 --> 41:38.586
YOU ARE A PARTNER,
OKAY, YOU HAVE THE MONEY.

41:38.690 --> 41:40.487
AND SHE WANTED THEM.

41:40.590 --> 41:41.898
SHE NEVER GETS
ANYTHING NEW.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.558
SHE NEVER GETS
ANYTHING FOR HERSELF.

41:43.660 --> 41:45.992
WE HAVE A RULE,
ANGELICA, OKAY ?

41:46.100 --> 41:48.898
IF WE'RE GONNA SPEND MORE THAN
$100.00 ON THE CREDIT CARD

41:49.000 --> 41:50.558
WE CHECK IN
WITH EACH OTHER FIRST.

41:50.670 --> 41:51.864
SHE KNEW
YOU'D BE PISSED.

41:51.970 --> 41:53.767
THAT'S RIGHT,
I AM PISSED !

41:56.240 --> 42:01.542
SHE TAKES CARE OF YOUR KIDS
EVERY SINGLE DAY

42:01.650 --> 42:05.643
AND WORKS A FULL TIME JOB
ON TOP OF THAT.

42:05.750 --> 42:06.819
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.649
NO WONDER
SHE'S DEPRESSED !

42:08.760 --> 42:11.649
SO, SHE BOUGHT A NEW TV
AND A NEW REFRIGERATOR.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.819
THEY WERE BOTH
ON SALE.

42:13.930 --> 42:15.955
GIVE HER A
FUCKING BREAK, RICO !

42:16.060 --> 42:17.823
SHE DESERVES IT !

42:30.310 --> 42:31.538
( door slamming )

42:31.650 --> 42:33.242
( doorbell )

42:34.620 --> 42:35.644
MAY I HELP YOU ?

42:35.750 --> 42:36.739
YES, THANK YOU.

42:36.850 --> 42:38.442
I WAS HERE
EARLIER TODAY.

42:38.550 --> 42:40.211
FOR DOROTHY SU'S
FUNERAL.

42:40.320 --> 42:43.710
AND I THINK I MAY HAVE
LEI-T MY READING GLASSES.

42:47.990 --> 42:49.548
I THINK I WAS
SITTING HERE.

42:49.660 --> 42:52.868
NO, MAYBE
IT WAS OVER HERE.

42:54.430 --> 42:56.660
OH, HERE THEY ARE.

42:56.770 --> 43:00.934
I MISPLACE THEM
ALL THE TIME.

43:02.010 --> 43:03.568
WELL, THANK YOU.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.170
YOU'RE WELCOME.

43:08.110 --> 43:09.941
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

43:10.050 --> 43:11.938
ALTHOUGH, TO BE
PERFECT LY HONEST,

43:12.050 --> 43:14.018
I REALLY DIDN'T
KNOW MRS. SU.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.759
I USED TO SEE HER
EVERY MORNING, THOUGH.

43:16.860 --> 43:18.885
THAT'S WHERE
I GET MY NEWSPAPER.

43:18.990 --> 43:21.458
( sobbing )

43:21.560 --> 43:24.358
I'M SORRY, DID I SAY
SOMETHING WRONG ?

43:24.460 --> 43:26.860
NO.

43:28.100 --> 43:31.137
MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
IS MISSING

43:31.240 --> 43:33.902
AND I THOUGHT I HAD A FEELING
THINGS WOULD TURN OUT ALRIGHT,

43:34.010 --> 43:37.377
BUT NOW THEY'VE FOUND HER CAR
AND I STILL HAVE A FEELING.

43:37.480 --> 43:41.917
ONLY NOW IT'S A FEELING THAT
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.

43:47.050 --> 43:49.814
( sobbing )

43:56.730 --> 43:58.823
I'M SO SORRY.

43:58.930 --> 44:00.693
I'VE JUST CRIED
ALL OVER YOUR JACKET

44:00.800 --> 44:04.634
AND YOU'RE
A COMPLETE STRANGER.

44:04.740 --> 44:07.868
NOT ANYMORE,
I'M NOT.

44:16.950 --> 44:18.474
YOU COULD HAVE
CALLED ME,

44:18.580 --> 44:20.343
I WOULD'VE BEEN MORE THAN HAPPY
TO BRING SOME STUFF OVER.

44:20.450 --> 44:24.386
NO, THANKS,
THIS WAY IS EASIER.

44:24.490 --> 44:26.822
SO, HOW'S EVERYBODY
HOLDING UP ?

44:26.930 --> 44:29.854
ABOUT AS WELL AS
CAN BE EXPECTED.

44:29.960 --> 44:32.963
I TALKED TO MY BUDDY
IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT,

44:33.070 --> 44:35.038
HE SAID THEY PUT HER ON
THE STATEWIDE TELETYPE SYSTEM.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.028
THANK YOU...

44:37.140 --> 44:38.630
FOR DOING THAT.

44:38.740 --> 44:40.332
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,
I JUST MADE A PHONE CALL.

44:40.440 --> 44:41.737
WELL...

44:41.840 --> 44:43.876
THANK YOU
FOR BEING THERE...

44:43.980 --> 44:45.277
HERE.

44:45.380 --> 44:48.349
WHATEVER.

44:54.760 --> 44:57.115
HOW ARE YOU DOING ?

44:57.220 --> 44:58.448
ME?

44:58.560 --> 45:00.027
FINE.

45:00.130 --> 45:02.257
LIAR.

45:04.030 --> 45:05.861
YOU WANT TO STAY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE ?

45:05.970 --> 45:07.267
NO.

45:07.370 --> 45:11.488
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE
SUCH A GOOD IDEA RIGHT NOW.

45:11.600 --> 45:14.899
OKAY, THEN.

45:15.010 --> 45:17.205
CALL ME IF YOU
HEAR ANYTHING,

45:17.310 --> 45:19.471
OR NEED ANYTHING ?

45:19.580 --> 45:22.447
YEAH, I WILL.

( Latin music )

46:15.300 --> 46:17.768

46:28.850 --> 46:32.217
WE THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
COULD USE SOME COMPANY.
