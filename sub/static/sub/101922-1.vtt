(suspenseful music)

00:43.920 --> 00:45.100
Beatrix.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.300
- Oh, sorry, darling, I
didn't hear you there.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.220
- I'm going up. You coming?

00:49.320 --> 00:51.320

- [Narrator] A curious mouse crept

01:36.040 --> 01:38.040
from his room in the house

01:39.360 --> 01:41.920
and knew then that his father had died.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.620
He'd seen this doctor before
take his sister to the morgue,

01:49.720 --> 01:52.280
and he realized the grown-ups had lied,

01:55.520 --> 01:57.780
for this world wasn't magic.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.460
It was often quite tragic.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.920
Not every mouse lived to grow old.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.980
So while misery reigned,

02:06.080 --> 02:08.300
he'd retreat to his brain,

02:08.400 --> 02:11.740
for the tales he wanted to be told.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.940

04:25.040 --> 04:27.940

Oh, do shush, will you?

06:35.280 --> 06:36.620
- Happy Christmas, Miss Potter.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.740
- It's Mrs. Heelis to you.

06:38.840 --> 06:42.340
And I'll thank you not to
trespass on my property.

06:42.440 --> 06:43.740
- Well, just trying to do something nice

06:43.840 --> 06:45.420
for the kiddies at Christmas.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.420
- I think I've done my bit for that lot.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.360
Now get off my land or
I'll set my dog on you.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.420

06:58.960 --> 07:00.940
- Happy Christmas, Miss Potter.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.040

07:40.440 --> 07:42.440
I see.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.040
No one will make you go in there, Roald.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.920
It's hard so soon after
losing your sister.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.380
Now is our chance for goodbyes,

07:54.480 --> 07:56.460
if goodbyes are something you want.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.200
(ominous music)

08:01.360 --> 08:03.700
- Will you come with me?

08:03.800 --> 08:05.800
- Of course.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.760
(tense music)

08:22.120 --> 08:23.780
When we get inside, Papa's in bed,

08:23.880 --> 08:28.260
but, Roald, it's not really
Papa anymore, understand?

08:28.360 --> 08:29.300
It's just a body,

08:29.400 --> 08:31.820
so if you don't want to see,

08:31.920 --> 08:36.300
just close your eyes, all
scrunched tight, like this.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.980
Okay?

08:38.080 --> 08:39.540
- Okay.

08:53.640 --> 08:57.920

09:01.720 --> 09:04.980
- Mrs. Dahl, I was wondering
if I might have a word

09:05.080 --> 09:07.080
about our route to the church.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.300
- Certainly.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.680

(dramatic music)

09:43.280 --> 09:44.860
(door clacks)
(record scratches)

09:44.960 --> 09:48.240
- You, boy, keep your filthy
hands off the deceased!

09:49.120 --> 09:50.740
(dramatic music)

09:50.840 --> 09:51.860
(record scratches)

09:51.960 --> 09:53.860
(playful music)

09:53.960 --> 09:55.380
- [William] Beatrix!

09:55.480 --> 09:56.660
- Coming!

09:56.760 --> 10:01.760
(playful music)
(Sago quacking)

10:19.960 --> 10:22.620
- I mean, to bury your
little girl is one thing,

10:22.720 --> 10:24.700
but then to have your
husband dead and all,

10:24.800 --> 10:27.100
before a month have even passed,

10:27.200 --> 10:29.600
well, too much for any woman.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.500
- It's a crock and tragedy is what it is.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.220
- Hmm.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.100
- Mentally troubled too, I heard.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.480
- Never! Who told you that?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.060
- You did, I think.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.540
- Did I?

10:44.640 --> 10:46.420
Well, it must be true then

10:46.520 --> 10:49.180
- Oh yeah, she's packin'
the boy off to school

10:49.280 --> 10:51.660
and headin' back to her mother in Norway.

10:51.760 --> 10:52.980
- Makes sense.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.180
She can't be managin' 'em all on her own.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.660
- Probably got another stab at marriage,

10:56.760 --> 10:59.980
if she manages to pack
all them brats somewhere.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.080
Wouldn't mind a shot myself.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.300
- You never had a problem with
seconds, have you, Butler?

11:05.400 --> 11:06.460
- What can I say?

11:06.560 --> 11:08.600
I'm a man of huge appetites.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.200
(both laugh)

11:19.000 --> 11:20.180
May I?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.380
- No, you may not.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.420
She's my mother, and you can't have her.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.780
(kick thuds)
(Butler grunts)

11:25.880 --> 11:28.800
(group chattering)

11:31.840 --> 11:33.740
- [Doctor] And clearer now

11:33.840 --> 11:35.840
or now?
- Now.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.140
I don't appreciate
being ambushed, William.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.700
- It's not an ambush.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.700
Mr. Entwistle has kindly
found time for a house call.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.900
You seem to have accidentally missed

11:48.000 --> 11:49.300
your previous appointments.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.660
- Now or now?
- Now.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.860
- And stopped opening
correspondence and writing letters.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.220
- Now or now?
- Now.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.580
Well, that's because,
if you haven't noticed,

12:00.680 --> 12:02.300
I am writing-
- I know.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.380
You're very busy not writing a book.

12:05.480 --> 12:06.260
- Exactly.

12:06.360 --> 12:10.300
And those books don't not
write themselves, you know.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.940
- [Doctor] And clearer now

12:12.040 --> 12:13.380
(Sally grunts)

12:13.480 --> 12:14.820
or now?

12:14.920 --> 12:16.620
- I'm not sure.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.260
Now, or possibly now.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.180
I, I don't know anymore.

12:21.280 --> 12:24.740
(Sally flatulates)

12:24.840 --> 12:26.260
Pardon me.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.060
(Sally flatulates)

12:29.160 --> 12:31.160
- (clears throat) And, um,

12:32.080 --> 12:34.060
how's your vision been over the last year?

12:34.160 --> 12:36.060
- I, I don't know.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.340
Everything's getting a bit
foggy on the fells, these days.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.440
- Regardless of the weather.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.240
What'd you think?

12:44.960 --> 12:45.940
- Well, very simply,

12:46.040 --> 12:49.420
evidence of age-related
macular degeneration.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.980
- He means old lady eyes, doesn't he?

12:52.080 --> 12:55.420
- I mean, could it be
glaucoma or cataracts?

12:55.520 --> 12:57.020
- Hard to say without further examination.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.180
Ideally, I'd need her to
come in for further tests.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.940
(Beatrix whispers)

13:03.040 --> 13:06.300
Well, seeing as you're
very, very, very busy,

13:06.400 --> 13:08.260
for the time being-

13:08.360 --> 13:09.540
- Oh God!

13:09.640 --> 13:12.180
You're going to make me
wear spectacles, aren't you?

13:12.280 --> 13:14.060
- It might help.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.600
I have some temporary
ones, if you'd like to try.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.480
- I'll consider it, later.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.140
So, uh, gentlemen, unless
there's something else,

13:24.240 --> 13:27.500
other than my age-related degeneration,

13:27.600 --> 13:29.960
I'm afraid I really am rather busy.

13:30.920 --> 13:31.700
- Thank you.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.700
We really do appreciate you
coming out all this way.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.580
Don't we, Beatrix?

13:35.680 --> 13:36.780
Beatrix?

13:36.880 --> 13:38.880
- Yes, most kind.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.980
- Sorry, before I go,
I couldn't possibly ask

13:41.080 --> 13:43.080
for an autograph, could I?

13:45.280 --> 13:47.840
- Oh, do you have children?

13:48.720 --> 13:50.540
- Oh, no, heavens no.

13:50.640 --> 13:51.900
Can't stand the blighters.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.260
Just wanted one for the office,

13:53.360 --> 13:55.300
pop it on the wall, celebrity
clients type of thing.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.640
We've got a cracking
one from Virginia Woolf.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.740
- Get him a rabbit card, William.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.480
(playful music)

14:14.480 --> 14:16.860
- Oh, that's topping!

14:16.960 --> 14:20.100
Look at that, his little
bunny whiskery face.

14:20.200 --> 14:24.860
Yeah, that's good.
That's very good indeed.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.920
You should write one about
Peter Rabbit getting spectacles.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.720
- Should I?

14:33.040 --> 14:35.300
- Yes, um, well, let
me know how you get on

14:35.400 --> 14:36.740
with that, yeah.
(Beatrix sighs)

14:36.840 --> 14:38.020
Happy Christmas.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.660
(playful music)

14:40.760 --> 14:43.220
I suppose her bark is
worse than her bite, is it?

14:43.320 --> 14:45.180
- No, no, it's not.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.260
Thanks all the same.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.040
(playful music)

15:11.520 --> 15:13.520
- Mind if I join you?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.700
What are you reading?

15:18.800 --> 15:20.740
Oh, of course.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.880
Beatrix Potter again.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.020
You know, I don't think I
see your face anymore, boy,

15:26.120 --> 15:28.120
just this.

15:28.880 --> 15:29.620
(Sofie chuckles)

15:29.720 --> 15:31.260
(Roald laughs)

15:31.360 --> 15:35.400
Perhaps, one day, you will lower the book,

15:36.280 --> 15:38.420
and there you will be, and, well,

15:38.520 --> 15:40.340
with a gigantic beard,

15:40.440 --> 15:42.900
and I will have missed the whole show.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.580
- I will never get a beard, not ever.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.100
- What did they say, Roald?

15:49.200 --> 15:52.580
- He said that you were
sending me away to school

15:52.680 --> 15:54.740
and that you'd go back
to Norway without us,

15:54.840 --> 15:57.320
and he was going to take you as his wife.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.620
(Sofie sighs)

16:00.720 --> 16:03.360
- You know what we call
men like this in Norway?

16:04.600 --> 16:07.580
(Sofie speaks in foreign language)

16:07.680 --> 16:09.680
You understand?

16:10.440 --> 16:12.380
It means, um,

16:12.480 --> 16:15.700
a great, big, bottom-hole man.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.700
(Roald laughs)

16:16.800 --> 16:17.900
- Mama.
- A great,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.740
big, saggy bottom-hole. (laughs)

16:20.840 --> 16:21.580
(Roald laughs)

16:21.680 --> 16:23.180
Come on, say it with me.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.300
(both speak in foreign language)

16:26.400 --> 16:28.180
Very good, yes, loud as you can.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.300
I mean this. It's educational.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.940
(Sofie and Roald yell in foreign language)

16:33.040 --> 16:35.940
(both laughing)

16:36.040 --> 16:38.660
The man is a massive twit.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.820
I'm not going back to Norway.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.540
- What about me?

16:42.640 --> 16:44.800
You're not sending me away, are you?

16:47.360 --> 16:48.700
Mama?

16:48.800 --> 16:52.540
- Well, that's another thing.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.900
You're papa wanted.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.060
He always said that an English
education is the finest

16:58.160 --> 16:59.660
in the world.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.780
How else could such a tiny prump

17:01.880 --> 17:04.020
of a country become such a force.

17:04.120 --> 17:04.980
- Prump?

17:05.080 --> 17:05.860
- Fart.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.820
(both laugh)

17:08.920 --> 17:13.380
And I've heard about a very lovely school,

17:13.480 --> 17:15.480
not so far from here, Roald,

17:15.880 --> 17:17.580
just over the water, actually.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.300
- So you are sending me away.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.980
- No, no, not yet.

17:23.080 --> 17:27.680
We've got the whole of the
Christmas holidays to go first.

17:29.000 --> 17:29.820
- No!

17:29.920 --> 17:30.660
- Roald!

17:30.760 --> 17:32.020
- No, I don't want to go.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.500
- Sit down, please.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.820
Let me tell you about it, first.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.580
It sounds like an adventure.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.060
- No, I won't go!

17:38.160 --> 17:39.900
And you can't make me
and neither can Papa,

17:40.000 --> 17:40.740
because Papa's dead!

17:40.840 --> 17:43.320
(door clacks)

17:44.240 --> 17:49.060
(footsteps stomping)
(solemn music)

17:49.160 --> 17:51.560
(door thuds)

17:54.240 --> 17:56.800
(somber music)

17:58.480 --> 18:01.300
- A nasty flash of temper
the boy's got there.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.780
But you don't go worrying your
pretty little head about it.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.660
They'll soon beat that out
of him in boarding school.

18:06.760 --> 18:07.500
Give you a bit of time

18:07.600 --> 18:10.980
for your needs, you know, love.

18:11.080 --> 18:15.320
(Sofie speaks in foreign language)

18:16.760 --> 18:19.440
(playful music)

18:20.360 --> 18:22.440
Beautiful, that creature.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.080
Reckon I'm in now.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.160
(William sighs)

18:33.760 --> 18:36.740
- I thought it might help
you get this book done.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.580
That's all.
- That has nothing

18:38.680 --> 18:41.620
to do with my eyes, William.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.740
And I can't get this book done,

18:44.840 --> 18:47.900
because I don't want to
get this blasted book done.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.700
- Why ever not?

18:48.800 --> 18:53.140
- Because Warne's don't care
what they publish anymore.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.340
I'm just a blank check to them now.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.660
All they want is another
damned bunny book,

18:57.760 --> 18:58.940
irrespective of the content,

18:59.040 --> 19:01.260
and then it's Christmas
bonuses all around.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.820
- So just give them one.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.920
- I, I can't.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.420
(Beatrix sobbing)
Hey.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.700
(Beatrix mumbles)

19:11.800 --> 19:12.820
Say?

19:12.920 --> 19:17.620
- I, I don't want to
wear spectacles, Willie.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.720
They'll make me look like an old lady.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.220
- You are an old lady, Beatrix.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.260
(Beatrix laughs)

19:26.360 --> 19:28.360
A perfectly serviceable one, too.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.420
- And that's exactly why
I married you, Mr. Heelis,

19:32.520 --> 19:35.020
your romantic way with words.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.220
- Nonsense.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.540
You married me for my ability

19:38.640 --> 19:41.160
to access land registry documents.

19:42.720 --> 19:46.740
Troutbeck Farm, it's coming up soon,

19:46.840 --> 19:48.740
but we can't hang about
if you're interested.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.420
There's a hotel here in Manchester

19:50.520 --> 19:52.900
who's already sniffing about.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.020
- That's most of Kirkstone Pass.

19:55.120 --> 19:55.860
- Exactly.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.220
- Well, they mustn't get it.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.020
It would change the whole area.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.100
- They're planning to carve it up,

20:00.200 --> 20:01.620
sell it off in sections.

20:01.720 --> 20:02.940
- How many acres?

20:03.040 --> 20:04.780
Can you read the rest
of it to me, William?

20:04.880 --> 20:06.220
- No.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.340
- Beg your pardon?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.020
- I won't.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.420
Read it yourself,

20:10.520 --> 20:12.760
unless, of course, you need spectacles.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.880
(clock chimes)

20:30.480 --> 20:32.860
(Beatrix sighs)

20:32.960 --> 20:35.020
- Hello.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.120
Are you still in there, somewhere?

20:38.280 --> 20:40.260
(Fleet whimpers)

20:40.360 --> 20:43.140
Well, what do you think?

20:43.240 --> 20:44.100
(Fleet whimpers)

20:44.200 --> 20:45.100
Rude!

20:45.200 --> 20:46.660
- [William] Bloody animal!

20:46.760 --> 20:48.760
- Sally!

20:49.600 --> 20:51.020
Oh, Sally.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.260
What have you done this time?

20:52.360 --> 20:54.100
(Sally snorts)

20:54.200 --> 20:56.100
Just stay there, just
stay there, just sit.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.820
- Has that damn pig of yours
been in the house again?

20:58.920 --> 21:00.920
- No, not that I know of, no.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.700
Why?

21:03.800 --> 21:06.500
(Sally flatulates)

21:06.600 --> 21:08.860
I, uh, beg your pardon.

21:08.960 --> 21:09.940
- Beatrix.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.660
- Sorry, darling, I
think it might be nerves.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.900
Did you need anything?

21:15.000 --> 21:18.980
- No, sit down, get that
blasted book written,

21:19.080 --> 21:21.240
so we can finally enjoy Christmas.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.040
- Yes, I'm writing. I'm writing!

21:26.760 --> 21:29.220
Now just settle down and stay there.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.920
(Sally snorts)

21:37.480 --> 21:40.160
(Beatrix sighs)

21:44.240 --> 21:46.840
(lively music)

21:56.480 --> 21:59.320
(mouse squeaking)

22:14.120 --> 22:15.700
(mouse yells)

22:15.800 --> 22:18.180
(metal clangs)

22:18.280 --> 22:20.960
(clock ticking)

22:25.240 --> 22:27.800
(solemn music)

22:33.120 --> 22:35.840
(ethereal music)

22:43.040 --> 22:44.580
- [Narrator] To be sent from your home

22:44.680 --> 22:46.680
when you're left on your own,

22:47.080 --> 22:49.360
with a sister and father now dead,

22:50.400 --> 22:52.620
left no choice for our mouse,

22:52.720 --> 22:55.100
'cause a home's just a house,

22:55.200 --> 22:57.720
if the future there fills you with dread.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.020
(gentle music)

23:01.120 --> 23:03.140
- Roald!

23:03.240 --> 23:04.780
- How do you know my name?

23:04.880 --> 23:07.120
- Your sister Astri told me, pea-brain.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.200
Runnin' away, are you?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.980
- Maybe.

23:13.080 --> 23:16.060
I've got space in my bag if
you want to come with me.

23:16.160 --> 23:16.900
- No, thanks.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.900
I think I'd best stay on Astri's bed,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
just in case she comes back.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.780
- She isn't coming back.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.220
- I know.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.440
Roald, before you go,
would you do me a favor?

23:33.760 --> 23:34.900
Astri wrote this.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.740
I'm worried it won't get posted.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.440
(gentle music)

23:45.320 --> 23:48.260
- "Dear Father Christmas, I am seven.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.620
This year, I have been good.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.660
Please can you get a new
dress for my doll Lavender.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.460
Her old one is getting a bit frayed."

23:55.560 --> 23:57.740
- Hmm, it is a bit.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.180
- "And please, could you get Roald

23:59.280 --> 24:01.260
a new Beatrix Potter book.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.220
He's read me all his
old ones so many times,

24:04.320 --> 24:06.580
and I'd really like to hear something new.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.900
- Mm-hmm.
- "Do have a safe journey.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Love, Astri."

24:12.400 --> 24:13.980
- Would you post it for me?

24:14.080 --> 24:16.080
- Of course.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.780
See you then.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.380
- See you.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.080
And, Roald, do have a safe journey.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.580
(gentle music)

24:27.680 --> 24:28.980
(Lavender sighs)

24:29.080 --> 24:30.700
(door clacks)

24:30.800 --> 24:33.560
(Lavender sighs)

24:39.120 --> 24:41.800
(Beatrix sighs)

24:43.080 --> 24:45.660
(Beatrix mutters)

24:45.760 --> 24:48.440
(Beatrix sighs)

24:53.680 --> 24:56.360
(Beatrix yawns)

24:59.160 --> 25:00.780
(Sago quacking)

25:00.880 --> 25:05.500
- Oh, Sago, you have made a
foolish error there, my friend.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.780
I'll get you this time.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.480
(knife clinks)

25:14.040 --> 25:15.420
- Finished already?

25:15.520 --> 25:18.100
- Nearly. I've just got
to pop out and kill Sago.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.900
- Oh, honestly, Beatrix,

25:20.000 --> 25:21.940
I do wish you'd stop giving then names.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.300
It really does spoil a meal.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.400
- You're right. Sorry.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.480
Come on, dog.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.780
- I don't mind the pets,
just not the dinner.

25:33.880 --> 25:34.620
Please!

25:34.720 --> 25:35.740
- Absolutely.

25:35.840 --> 25:36.660
Come on.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.580
- When exactly are Warne's
expecting this book

25:38.680 --> 25:40.820
to be delivered by?

25:40.920 --> 25:42.460
- Tomorrow.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.500
But I'll say it was delayed in the post.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.180
You know what it's like this time of year.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.140
It'll be fine.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.740
And besides, it's only
the final manuscript.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.900
They've seen most of it already.

25:52.000 --> 25:52.980
- Beatrix.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.080
- Trust me, it'll be fine.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.220
(Fleet barks)

25:58.320 --> 26:01.780
(dramatic music)

26:01.880 --> 26:04.560
(ominous music)

26:13.280 --> 26:16.820
- [Narrator] Now when Mouse
left his home and set off alone,

26:16.920 --> 26:19.320
he was aware he was lacking a plan.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.660
But he knew in his heart

26:22.760 --> 26:26.460
that a good place to start was his map

26:26.560 --> 26:28.560
to a happier land.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.940
For whenever in doubt,

26:32.040 --> 26:34.360
if you're down but not out,

26:35.400 --> 26:38.280
there's comfort to be found between pages.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.500
But if it's true solace you seek,

26:42.600 --> 26:45.300
fire your mind, not your feet.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.400
And that healing, I'm afraid,

26:47.920 --> 26:49.920
well, that can take ages.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.000
(solemn music)

26:55.960 --> 26:57.960
- Roald!

26:59.520 --> 27:01.520
Roald!

27:02.840 --> 27:03.660
Roald!

27:03.760 --> 27:07.020
(ominous music)

27:07.120 --> 27:09.940
(ethereal music)
(wind whistling)

27:10.040 --> 27:13.040
(suspenseful music)

27:18.320 --> 27:20.720
- Ha, I've got you now, Sago.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.480
- [Man] Afternoon, Mrs. Heelis!

27:25.400 --> 27:27.400
- (sighs) Tom.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.420
What can I do to help you?

27:29.520 --> 27:30.860
- Ah, I just wanted to let you know

27:30.960 --> 27:33.580
I'm taking your first lot of
Herdwicks up on the fell now

27:33.680 --> 27:35.340
if you wanted to follow on.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.820
- Oh can't wee keep them
on Hill Top, over winter?

27:37.920 --> 27:38.820
- Keep 'em here?

27:38.920 --> 27:41.240
(scoffs) No, no, no, no, no.

27:42.320 --> 27:45.380
You may get your London sheep
able to live in those sort

27:45.480 --> 27:48.140
of cramped and squalid
conditions, Mrs. Heelis,

27:48.240 --> 27:50.180
not your Herdwicks, thank you very much.

27:50.280 --> 27:53.220
- Aren't actually that
many sheep in London, Tom.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.060
- Well, I wouldn't know.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.260
I've not been there myself.

27:56.360 --> 27:59.340
All I know is your Herdwicks
wouldn't stand for it.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.820
They need more land than that.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.460
- Like Troutbeck, that sort of land?

28:04.560 --> 28:06.100
- Exactly.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.900
Complicated breed, your Herdwick.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.020
- Hmm.
- They need space

28:10.120 --> 28:11.860
of their own,

28:11.960 --> 28:14.160
space to be left alone,

28:15.280 --> 28:17.100
to think.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.020
- Right.

28:18.120 --> 28:21.220
Do you think perhaps I was a Herdwick

28:21.320 --> 28:22.980
in a previous life, Tom? (laughs)

28:23.080 --> 28:24.220
- No.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.340
- I see.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.900
So you comin' or what?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.460
'Cause Herdwicks don't wait for no one,

28:28.560 --> 28:29.380
no matter who you are

28:29.480 --> 28:32.680
or what fancy part of London
town you're born and raised in.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.620
- Do you know what?

28:34.720 --> 28:39.780
You've just given me a very
good reason to get back to work,

28:39.880 --> 28:43.860
see if I can't buy our
ladies a bit more room.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.700
But call for me later,
and I'll join you then.

28:45.800 --> 28:46.940
- Suit yourself.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.040
I'm not bothered, either way.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.700
Come on now, you!

28:50.800 --> 28:52.780
Haven't got all bloody day.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.660
Well, I have, as you know,

28:55.760 --> 28:58.080
but I'm not spending it
with the likes of you.

28:59.720 --> 29:00.940
(train horn bellows)

29:01.040 --> 29:04.100
- [Man] Platform two,
we're expecting one soon.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.800
(solemn music)

29:08.480 --> 29:11.840
- [Man] Come on, move it out of the way!

29:12.840 --> 29:14.840
- Kentish cobnut?

29:15.480 --> 29:18.120
(playful music)

29:20.040 --> 29:22.040
Quite right, chicken.

29:23.880 --> 29:27.220
You've taken a shufty at
an old fungus like me,

29:27.320 --> 29:30.380
offering you up some dodgy
Manjari, and thought,

29:30.480 --> 29:34.140
not likely, pal! (laughs)

29:34.240 --> 29:36.580
You're no dido, are ya?

29:36.680 --> 29:37.780
(man laughs)

29:37.880 --> 29:39.500
- I try not to be.

29:39.600 --> 29:43.100
- Well, don't you worry
your bones about it.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.480
I'm a bonafide gent, make no mistakings.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.460
Where's a young fidelio like you off to,

29:51.560 --> 29:53.560
on your tort, anyhows?

29:53.960 --> 29:55.960
- Here.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.100
(man whistles)

29:59.200 --> 30:01.200
- Fantabulosa!

30:01.600 --> 30:03.420
Bona place to call your flowery patch,

30:03.520 --> 30:05.340
if you can get heels on it, eh?

30:05.440 --> 30:06.860
- It's in the Lake District.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.140
- Yeah?

30:08.240 --> 30:11.200
You got the denari for a trip
up a district, like that?

30:12.160 --> 30:13.100
- Sorry?

30:13.200 --> 30:15.460
- The medzas, moola,

30:15.560 --> 30:16.780
the filthy lucre?

30:16.880 --> 30:19.140
- (chuckles) Oh, yes, a bit.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.300
- Gushti.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.500
'Cause you could always
come see your Unky Bonafide,

30:23.600 --> 30:25.600
if you get stuck in the brassicas.

30:26.440 --> 30:28.540
Despite the shonky garms,

30:28.640 --> 30:30.500
I'm not short on the old lollipops,

30:30.600 --> 30:31.820
if you follow my fathoms.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.180
(coins jingling)

30:33.280 --> 30:34.780
(man laughs)

30:34.880 --> 30:36.340
- I'm fine. Thank you.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.900
- Smashing!

30:38.000 --> 30:40.740
In that case, keep your orbs in your bunts

30:40.840 --> 30:42.980
and your lally tappers on
the end of your stimps,

30:43.080 --> 30:45.340
ready to scarper, if need be.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.820
Am I right or am I left?

30:46.920 --> 30:48.920
- (laughs) Right.
- Right.

30:50.320 --> 30:54.100
Oh, hold on to your Irish
jig, my little ragioso.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.780
There's a sharpy palone
headin' straight for us.

30:56.880 --> 31:00.620
So if you don't mind, I
might take this opportunity

31:00.720 --> 31:02.720
to wish you a bona noche.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.780
- Bona noche?

31:04.880 --> 31:07.640
(dramatic music)

31:10.160 --> 31:12.580
- Yes, Miss, here's one.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.240
(solemn music)

31:18.680 --> 31:23.680
(train chugging)
(solemn music)

31:26.080 --> 31:27.500
- [Sofie] Hello.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.600
- Hello.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.380
(Sofie sighs)

31:34.480 --> 31:36.480
- Fancy meeting you here.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.420
(Sofie sighs)

31:40.520 --> 31:43.180
- I wouldn't have actually gone, you know.

31:43.280 --> 31:47.340
- I know. (sniffs)

31:47.440 --> 31:50.480
Do you think you might
like to come home, perhaps?

31:51.880 --> 31:53.880
- So you can send me away again?

31:55.400 --> 31:57.400
- I'm not sending you away.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.820
I'm just asking you to think about it.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.920
For me and for Papa.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.740
- If you do something for me.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.100
- Oh?

32:11.200 --> 32:13.200
A deal? I see.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.920
What is it?

32:17.960 --> 32:19.960
- [Roald] Take me here.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.980
- Beatrix Potter's house?

32:23.080 --> 32:25.480
Well, this is Cumbria, isn't it?

32:26.720 --> 32:29.980
- You're thinking it's too far to go.

32:30.080 --> 32:34.200
- Actually, I'm thinking I hope
this train leaves sometime.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.060
We've a long journey ahead of us.

32:38.160 --> 32:39.300
(bright music)

32:39.400 --> 32:41.180
- Oh.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.180
(whistle blows)

32:42.280 --> 32:44.660
- Come on, what you waitin' for?

32:44.760 --> 32:46.260
All aboard, ya dolly old minx!

32:46.360 --> 32:47.500
- [Sofie] Come on, let's go.

32:47.600 --> 32:51.620
- [Narrator] Mouse knew with
one glance this was his chance.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.340
If missed, he might not get another,

32:54.440 --> 32:56.440
for he was now strong as iron

32:56.880 --> 32:58.220
and brave as a lion,

32:58.320 --> 33:00.440
as long as by his side was his mother.

33:01.320 --> 33:06.320
(upbeat music)
(train chugging)

33:24.880 --> 33:26.880
- William!

33:27.360 --> 33:29.460
Sorry, I've taken so long.

33:29.560 --> 33:34.220
Sago, I mean, dinner is
being very uncooperative,

33:34.320 --> 33:37.060
and then I saw Tom.

33:37.160 --> 33:37.900
- [William] There's a visitor.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.420
- Sorry, I cannot hear a word.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.060
Let me just get my boots off.

33:42.160 --> 33:42.920
- [William] You've got a visitor.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.300
- I cannot hear you.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.660
I'll be in, in a minute.

33:46.760 --> 33:48.300
(Beatrix sighs)

33:48.400 --> 33:51.740
I suppose I'm losing my
hearing as well as my sight.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.340
You'll be towing me across the fells

33:53.440 --> 33:55.440
in a bath chair soon, Fleet.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.900
(Beatrix groans)

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Ooh!

34:05.400 --> 34:08.660
(sighs) Not again, Tom Kitten.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.820
(whistle blows)

34:11.920 --> 34:14.680
(train chugging)

34:28.000 --> 34:30.840
- You mind? I just need
to stretch the leg.

34:37.720 --> 34:40.160
Thank you so much,
terribly, terribly kind.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.380
Roald, psst!

34:45.480 --> 34:48.060
Roald, let's play a game.

34:48.160 --> 34:50.160
- Okay, what game?

34:50.520 --> 34:52.520
- Hide and seek.

34:53.280 --> 34:53.980
- A bit tricky.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.140
- Mm-hmm.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.100
Okay, tag.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.700
- Again, tricky.

34:59.800 --> 35:03.120
- Mm, yes, tricky, tricky, you're right.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.460
- I spy.

35:05.560 --> 35:06.580
- Look, do you mind?

35:06.680 --> 35:08.140
I'm trying to read the newspaper.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.280
I would appreciate some quiet.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.780
- I am so very sorry.

35:13.880 --> 35:18.260
We had no idea you were
doing something so important.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.900
Forgive us.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
- Just keep it down, will you?

35:23.160 --> 35:25.160
- Of course.

35:26.800 --> 35:31.040
We will be quiet as
mices, won't we, Roald?

35:33.280 --> 35:35.280
Sandwich, darling?

35:36.200 --> 35:37.860
- Not hungry.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.960
- Yes, you are, darling.

35:42.360 --> 35:45.040
(playful music)

35:47.400 --> 35:49.980
(Sofie and Roald laugh)

35:50.080 --> 35:50.940
- All right, that's it.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.420
Enough of this whiffle.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.820
(Roald chuckles)

35:55.920 --> 35:58.720
(sandwich splats)

35:59.680 --> 36:01.300
I bid you both good day.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.340
(playful music)

36:02.440 --> 36:05.860
(Roald laughing)

36:05.960 --> 36:06.780
- Whiffle?

36:06.880 --> 36:09.060
(both laughing)

36:09.160 --> 36:11.800
(playful music)

36:28.320 --> 36:33.320
(bell ringing)
(people chattering)

36:37.040 --> 36:38.620
Wait here for a taxi.

36:38.720 --> 36:39.780
I'll be right back.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.860
(people chattering)

36:42.960 --> 36:45.720
- [Woman] Thank you. Quickly now!

36:49.280 --> 36:50.100
- [Man] Get the sheep.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.880
Get the sheepdog. Get a move on.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.500
- Hurry up!

37:01.600 --> 37:02.980
I haven't got all day.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.180
Oh, come on!

37:04.280 --> 37:05.300
- Very slippery.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.400
Here you go, ma'am.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.540
- Get in, come on.
- Careful, or you'll fall.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.640
- [Woman] Get a move on.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.920
- Excuse me, sorry.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.820
But I was actually next in line.

37:18.920 --> 37:22.500
- Oh? Were you indeed, you little pest?

37:22.600 --> 37:25.060
Well, you ain't next in
line anymore, are you?

37:25.160 --> 37:27.160
- But I was.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.440
What a horrid lady.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.660
- Tell me about it.

37:33.760 --> 37:34.500
- Wow.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.460
- You should try livin' with her.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.580
- You can talk?

37:37.680 --> 37:39.420
- Hey, buddy, what can I tell ya?

37:39.520 --> 37:40.780
I used to do a whole lot of things

37:40.880 --> 37:43.020
before this mook got hold of me.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.260
- Like what?

37:44.360 --> 37:45.620
- Like what, he says!

37:45.720 --> 37:48.340
I could see in the dark,
dig a den a mile deep,

37:48.440 --> 37:50.260
run faster than an automobile.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.820
Now look at me, an accessory to nothin'.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.780
- Why don't you just run away?

37:54.880 --> 37:55.980
- I've thought about it, pal.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.580
Don't get me wrong, I have.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.380
But to tell ya the truth,

37:59.480 --> 38:01.460
in the end, I just don't have the guts.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.140
(both laugh)

38:03.240 --> 38:04.300
I don't have the guts. You get it?

38:04.400 --> 38:05.980
(both laugh)

38:06.080 --> 38:07.820
'Cause they took my guts away.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.460
(Roald laughing)

38:10.560 --> 38:13.300
- What are you laughing
at, you nasty little brat?

38:13.400 --> 38:15.340
- Nothing, nothing at all.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.580
(woman scoffs)

38:17.680 --> 38:19.920
- [Woman] Hey, George,
and don't dilly dally.

38:21.640 --> 38:24.400
(car doors thud)

38:25.560 --> 38:27.560
- Be lucky, hombre. Be lucky!

38:29.000 --> 38:31.680
(quirky music)

38:33.440 --> 38:34.700
- Who was that?

38:34.800 --> 38:35.980
- No one.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.140
- Mm!

38:38.240 --> 38:41.060
Come on, don't stand about with
your beard in the post box.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.100
Apparently, we can walk from here.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.380
(gentle music)

38:45.480 --> 38:47.480
Come on.

38:48.040 --> 38:53.040
(Sofie sighs)
(gentle music)

38:53.880 --> 38:58.020
(ethereal music)
(wind whistling)

38:58.120 --> 39:00.980
- Another present from Tom Kitten.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.420
- Revolting creature.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.700
Now you're givin' it to me.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.940
(Beatrix laughs)
Thank you so much.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.420
Shall I tell her that you'll see her now?

39:08.520 --> 39:10.060
- Tell who I'll see what?

39:10.160 --> 39:12.180
- [William] Your young lady.

39:12.280 --> 39:13.780
- I haven't got a young lady.

39:13.880 --> 39:14.580
- Well, you have.

39:14.680 --> 39:15.740
She's in the drawing room.

39:15.840 --> 39:19.900
- (sighs) But I haven't
killed Christmas dinner yet.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.460
- Honestly, Beatrix, leave that to me.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.560
You have a guest.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.760
- Fine!

39:32.200 --> 39:33.620
Can I help you?

39:33.720 --> 39:36.660
- Beatrix Potter, so lovely to meet you.

39:36.760 --> 39:38.620
I am a huge, huge fan.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.500
Anne Landy.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.860
- Oh, I wasn't expecting visitors today.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.060
- Oh really?

39:45.160 --> 39:47.340
Oh don't say that, I can't bear it.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.500
Warne assured me he'd
made several introductions

39:49.600 --> 39:50.900
on my behalf.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.300
Didn't you get his letters?

39:52.400 --> 39:57.180
- Uh, no, I'm afraid not.

39:57.280 --> 39:59.820
Delayed in the Christmas post, perhaps.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.900
- Yes, perhaps, perhaps.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.540
The post is dreadful at this time of year.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.700
It's dreadful.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.620
I sent a cardigan to my sister in Freund.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.100
Do you know she still hasn't got it?

40:08.200 --> 40:09.660
- When did you post it?

40:09.760 --> 40:11.760
- About two years ago now.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.620
- I see.

40:14.720 --> 40:19.720
What exactly can I do
to help you, Miss Landy?

40:20.680 --> 40:22.060
- Oh, gosh, of course!

40:22.160 --> 40:23.080
If you haven't received his letters,

40:23.160 --> 40:24.380
you wouldn't know, would you?

40:24.480 --> 40:25.580
Shall we start all over again?

40:25.680 --> 40:27.380
- No, that's not really necessary.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.700
I-
- Beatrix Potter,

40:28.800 --> 40:30.260
lovely to meet you, huge fan.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.540
Anne Landy, work at Warne's.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.940
They sent me to collect
the manuscript in person.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.220
Save you the postage.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.320
- Have they, indeed?

40:39.480 --> 40:41.420
That's most kind.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.780
- Can't have your lovely new
manuscript going the same way

40:43.880 --> 40:44.980
as my sister's cardigan, now can we?

40:45.080 --> 40:46.620
- No, heaven forbid.

40:46.720 --> 40:49.740
- So shall we get some tea,

40:49.840 --> 40:51.340
take a look at what you've been up to,

40:51.440 --> 40:53.440
you clever old thing you?

40:54.560 --> 40:56.660
- Thank you. That goes there.

40:56.760 --> 41:00.020
(wind whistling)

41:00.120 --> 41:02.880
(ethereal music)

41:07.040 --> 41:10.020
(Sofie gasping)

41:10.120 --> 41:11.660
- So, this is it then?

41:11.760 --> 41:14.740
- It's exactly like the
drawings, Mama, exactly,

41:14.840 --> 41:17.660
even the rhubarb plants by the gate, look.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.420
- I can see.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.260
(ethereal music)
(Sofie sighs)

41:22.360 --> 41:24.380
- Thank you.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.380
- What for?

41:25.480 --> 41:27.480
- For bringing me.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.260
- Sorry, you mean that is it?

41:31.360 --> 41:33.420
- Yeah, so I've seen it now.

41:33.520 --> 41:35.740
- (laughs) No, no, no, no.

41:35.840 --> 41:39.260
We did not travel all this way

41:39.360 --> 41:42.700
to boil away to nothing in cabbage.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.820
Go in.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.980
- I can't. I'm not allowed.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.100
- Says who so?

41:47.200 --> 41:49.200
- They do, right there.

41:50.280 --> 41:51.860
- Oh, (speaks in foreign language).

41:51.960 --> 41:52.900
You're Norwegian.

41:53.000 --> 41:53.940
You can't read that.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.040
Just pretend you haven't seen it.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
- Really?
- Yes, yes.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.140
- Will you come with me?

42:03.240 --> 42:05.580
- (laughs) Darling boy,

42:05.680 --> 42:09.400
if I come with you on every
adventure you have in life,

42:10.440 --> 42:13.420
you'll never have any
stories to tell me, will you?

42:13.520 --> 42:14.700
- [Roald] I suppose.

42:14.800 --> 42:18.420
- And when I am a little old lady,

42:18.520 --> 42:20.700
stuck at home with a blanket on my knees,

42:20.800 --> 42:24.580
I will need you, out
here, in this big world,

42:24.680 --> 42:26.680
telling me all about it.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.060
Now go, start your adventures now.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.580
I'll be back in one hour, okay?

42:32.680 --> 42:34.700
- Okay.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.700
- Okay.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.400
(gentle music)

42:39.360 --> 42:40.460
You'll be fine.

42:40.560 --> 42:43.120
(gentle music)

43:01.640 --> 43:02.700
(bright music)

43:02.800 --> 43:04.060
- [Narrator] As Mouse scampered ahead

43:04.160 --> 43:06.180
to the words she had said wrapped him up

43:06.280 --> 43:08.540
as if now he wore armor.

43:08.640 --> 43:12.420
And whatever he found,
every detail, every sound,

43:12.520 --> 43:15.700
he'd remember and take home to charm her.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.400
(bright music)

43:52.680 --> 43:55.360
(clock ticking)

44:09.560 --> 44:11.880
- So, what do you think?

44:14.320 --> 44:18.200
- Well, let me be totally honest with you.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.020
I think it's divine.

44:24.120 --> 44:28.540
(laughs) Sorry, your face then, so funny.

44:28.640 --> 44:31.380
You thought I was going to
be cross, but I love it.

44:31.480 --> 44:33.880
The little rabbit making ale in a pinny.

44:34.720 --> 44:36.060
- Cecily Parsley.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.260
- Yes, Cecily, absolutely love her.

44:38.360 --> 44:39.460
Warne's will go bananas for it.

44:39.560 --> 44:41.580
Honestly, I think we'll
sell this by the ton.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.500
I just know we will.

44:43.600 --> 44:44.380
- I'm sure you will.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.700
- Watch out, Peter Rabbit,
there's a new bunny in town.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.740
(Anne laughs)

44:48.840 --> 44:50.860
- Well, if I finish off a
couple of drawings today,

44:50.960 --> 44:52.340
you can take it back to London.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.420
- Smashing.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.520
Before you do...

44:57.320 --> 45:00.180
(Anne chuckles)

45:00.280 --> 45:01.420
(Anne sighs)

45:01.520 --> 45:03.260
- Is there a problem?

45:03.360 --> 45:05.360
- No flies on you, B.P.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.700
Warne was hoping you might be able

45:08.800 --> 45:11.000
to make one teeny-weeny alteration.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.340
- Oh, he was, was he?

45:13.440 --> 45:16.140
- It's just those rather
pesky blind mice of yours.

45:16.240 --> 45:17.700
(clicks) Eek.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.020
- What about them?

45:19.120 --> 45:20.100
- Well, nothing, obviously.

45:20.200 --> 45:21.220
We adore them.

45:21.320 --> 45:23.140
But general feeling in the office is

45:23.240 --> 45:26.060
that some of the language is a little too,

45:26.160 --> 45:27.420
how can I best put this?

45:27.520 --> 45:28.660
- I'd recommend quickly.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.140
- Extreme for the kiddies.
(Beatrix groans)

45:31.240 --> 45:33.540
I mean, the fact that they're
blind, in the first place,

45:33.640 --> 45:34.540
all three of the darlings-

45:34.640 --> 45:36.460
- It's a nursery rhyme.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.260
- But it's so sad.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.500
- Is it?

45:40.600 --> 45:42.180
(Beatrix grunts)

45:42.280 --> 45:43.700
(quirky music)

45:43.800 --> 45:45.140
What was that?

45:45.240 --> 45:46.340
- Uh, what was what?

45:46.440 --> 45:48.220
- In the garden, did you see it?

45:48.320 --> 45:50.060
- See what?

45:50.160 --> 45:51.740
- You were saying?

45:51.840 --> 45:53.980
- Yes, then despite
their obvious disability,

45:54.080 --> 45:56.220
the blind mice, out
comes the farmer's wife,

45:56.320 --> 45:58.820
and well, you know the rest.

45:58.920 --> 46:01.020
- Peter?

46:01.120 --> 46:02.100
Sorry.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.500
- She cuts off their tails
with a carving knife.

46:04.600 --> 46:05.740
(quirky music)

46:05.840 --> 46:07.540
- The nerve of people.

46:07.640 --> 46:08.820
- Exactly.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.220
Horrible!

46:10.320 --> 46:12.420
Not really bedtime story stuff, now is it?

46:12.520 --> 46:15.420
We don't want to give the
children nightmares, now do we?

46:15.520 --> 46:17.340
- I'm sorry. I don't follow.

46:17.440 --> 46:20.420
- So Warne's have sent me here in the hope

46:20.520 --> 46:22.260
that between us we
might be able to come up

46:22.360 --> 46:26.080
with something a little
less ghastly. (laughs)

46:29.000 --> 46:29.820
- We?

46:29.920 --> 46:32.260
- I know, you and me.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.020
Should be fun, don't you think?

46:34.120 --> 46:35.380
(Anne laughs)

46:35.480 --> 46:38.040
(quirky music)

46:40.200 --> 46:42.980
(ethereal music)
(wind whistling)

46:43.080 --> 46:45.680
(solemn music)

47:14.840 --> 47:16.840
- Closed, love.

47:17.280 --> 47:20.360
- Sorry, I'll rest here for a moment.

47:22.200 --> 47:24.860
(Sofie sighs)

47:24.960 --> 47:27.360
(Dora sighs)

47:31.120 --> 47:34.220
(Sofie sighs)

47:34.320 --> 47:37.340
(lock clicks)

47:37.440 --> 47:39.920
- Come on then, there's room at the inn.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.060
- What inn?

47:42.160 --> 47:42.900
- This one.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.100
Park yourself there.

47:45.200 --> 47:47.200
I'll get the kettle back on.

47:47.960 --> 47:50.260
- That's very kind. Thank you.

47:50.360 --> 47:53.740
- Well, can't be turning you away

47:53.840 --> 47:56.300
in your condition at Christmas.

47:56.400 --> 47:59.020
Who knows who've you got parked in there?

47:59.120 --> 48:03.100
I might go down in history as
Dora, the heartless waitress

48:03.200 --> 48:06.420
what turned away the new messiah. (laughs)

48:06.520 --> 48:08.740
- I don't think it's the new messiah.

48:08.840 --> 48:10.180
This is baby number five.

48:10.280 --> 48:11.380
- Ooh!

48:11.480 --> 48:13.480
Crikey, you have been busy.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.100
(Dora grunts)

48:16.200 --> 48:18.280
Hasn't your fella got any other hobbies?

48:19.400 --> 48:21.020
Tell him to take up cricket

48:21.120 --> 48:24.820
or cross-stitch or something. (laughs)

48:24.920 --> 48:26.260
And if that fails,

48:26.360 --> 48:29.520
just tie a knot in it. (laughs)

48:34.840 --> 48:37.020
Oh God.

48:37.120 --> 48:39.120
Oh you poor lamb.

48:40.360 --> 48:42.360
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

48:43.360 --> 48:44.180
He's left you,

48:44.280 --> 48:46.420
hasn't he?
- (sobs) No.

48:46.520 --> 48:48.520
- Not left you?

48:49.080 --> 48:51.080
He's not dead, is he?

48:52.280 --> 48:54.140
- This week,

48:54.240 --> 48:56.240
pneumonia, but then,

48:58.560 --> 49:01.080
two weeks before that,
my little girl died,

49:03.760 --> 49:08.760
burst appendix, and my
baby is due any day now.

49:09.360 --> 49:13.580
We have run out of money, almost entirely.

49:13.680 --> 49:17.180
And then, to top all the things off,

49:17.280 --> 49:20.900
my youngest son ran away from home

49:21.000 --> 49:24.520
to find a Puddle-Duck. (chuckles)

49:25.880 --> 49:28.540
- Right, you stay put.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.300
I'll be right back.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.660
- (sniffs) Where are you going?

49:32.760 --> 49:34.700
- To fetch the rest of that cake.

49:34.800 --> 49:37.400
We're gonna need it, judgin'
by the week you've had.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.860
- [Anne] They all run
after the farmer's wife,

49:42.960 --> 49:47.960
who releases them kindly
and ends all their strife.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.900
- No.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
- Who, who stands on a chair
and screams for her life.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.560
That's it! That's it!

49:57.920 --> 49:58.660
- Well, I'm sorry.

49:58.760 --> 50:02.020
You're saying a farmer's
wife screams for her life,

50:02.120 --> 50:03.620
because she's seen a mouse?

50:03.720 --> 50:07.740
- Well, not just one mouse,
three, and they're all blind.

50:07.840 --> 50:10.260
Think of it, it's utterly terrifying.

50:10.360 --> 50:14.300
- Have you ever met a
farmer's wife, Miss Landy?

50:14.400 --> 50:17.620
- No, never, but don't you
think it's scans beautifully?

50:17.720 --> 50:19.740
I love it.
- Yes, well, I don't.

50:19.840 --> 50:22.820
And the last time I checked,
it's still my name on the cover

50:22.920 --> 50:25.320
of these blasted little
books and not yours!

50:26.640 --> 50:29.500
(Beatrix sighs)

50:29.600 --> 50:31.100
- I see.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.420
- Look, I'm,

50:32.520 --> 50:35.540
I'm sorry I snapped, but the truth is,

50:35.640 --> 50:37.860
you, you haven't called at the best time.

50:37.960 --> 50:39.620
Christmas is days away,

50:39.720 --> 50:41.820
and I've still got so
much to do on the farm.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.300
I haven't even killed Sago yet.

50:44.400 --> 50:45.220
- I'm sorry, who?

50:45.320 --> 50:46.540
- The duck.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.940
- Beatrix, can I call you Beatrix?

50:49.040 --> 50:51.040
- No.

50:54.080 --> 50:56.520
- I think I know what the
problem really is here.

50:58.360 --> 51:00.640
In fact, everybody does.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.600
That's why they sent me.

51:10.640 --> 51:12.640
- What problem?

51:13.080 --> 51:15.080
- Oh, please.

51:15.600 --> 51:17.780
Don't pretend you wouldn't
rather be out there,

51:17.880 --> 51:22.720
with your sheep or pigs,
rather than in here with me.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.800
- Mm-hmm.

51:26.480 --> 51:28.480
- And yet,

51:30.080 --> 51:32.760
the money is awfully useful, isn't it?

51:37.280 --> 51:40.000
- What exactly are you proposing?

51:42.400 --> 51:45.060
- All I'm saying is the
sooner you just sign off

51:45.160 --> 51:46.180
and agree to my text,

51:46.280 --> 51:48.100
the sooner you can get back on the farm.

51:48.200 --> 51:51.080
We get this sold, and
everyone's happy, are they not?

51:53.960 --> 51:55.940
(sheep bleating)

51:56.040 --> 51:57.860
(Beatrix sighs)

51:57.960 --> 52:01.420
- Fine, change the text, have it your way.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.420
- Marvelous.

52:03.520 --> 52:06.100
Now that's something we can all drink to.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.220
- Not that cup.
(Anne gasps)

52:08.320 --> 52:09.780
- [Anne] Oh my, it's dead.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.880
How frightfully awful!

52:13.360 --> 52:14.420
- What?

52:14.520 --> 52:16.520
I'm saving it for later.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.700
- To eat?

52:18.800 --> 52:21.180
- No, to draw, of course.

52:21.280 --> 52:24.740
- Oh, of course, silly
old me, I thought...

52:24.840 --> 52:26.100
Never mind.

52:26.200 --> 52:28.300
- [Beatrix] Oh, little blighter!

52:28.400 --> 52:29.180
- [Anne] I beg your pardon.

52:29.280 --> 52:30.660
- Oh no, you don't.
- What?

52:30.760 --> 52:32.140
Beatrix, no, where are you going?

52:32.240 --> 52:32.940
Where are you going?

52:33.040 --> 52:34.980
'Cause we haven't actually finished.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.260
Beatrix!
(door thuds)

52:36.360 --> 52:39.060
- You have been so kind.

52:39.160 --> 52:42.340
- I was gonna say a problem
shared is a problem halved,

52:42.440 --> 52:44.460
but in your case, I think you've had more

52:44.560 --> 52:46.560
than your fair share.

52:46.960 --> 52:51.120
- Well, maybe I'm due some
good luck then. (chuckles)

52:52.440 --> 52:54.460
- Well, let's find out, shall we?

52:54.560 --> 52:58.080
Sup up, and I'll take a look
at what's coming for you.

52:59.200 --> 53:01.020
- I don't, I don't understand. (laughs)

53:01.120 --> 53:03.180
- I can read leaves, can't I,

53:03.280 --> 53:05.280
see the future in your cup.

53:06.400 --> 53:08.100
- (laughs) Okay.

53:08.200 --> 53:08.980
- Come on then.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.940
(Sofie slurping)
Pass it over.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.600
(quirky music)

53:46.600 --> 53:48.340
- [Beatrix] Hey, you out there!

53:48.440 --> 53:49.540
(dramatic music)

53:49.640 --> 53:51.500
Can't you read?

53:51.600 --> 53:53.600
No trespassers, it says!

53:57.880 --> 53:59.880
- Oh, I see a journey.

54:01.040 --> 54:03.780
And it looks likes it's going towards a,

54:03.880 --> 54:06.220
a palm tree, I think.

54:06.320 --> 54:07.820
Oh, so somewhere sunny.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.660
(Sofie laughs)

54:09.760 --> 54:10.820
- I doubt it,

54:10.920 --> 54:14.620
unless you mean the next
train to Cardiff. (chuckles)

54:14.720 --> 54:17.220
- Oh, actually, now you say it,

54:17.320 --> 54:18.700
it could be an umbrella.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.780
- Mm, more like it. (laughs)

54:20.880 --> 54:23.620
- And I see money,

54:23.720 --> 54:24.940
lots of money.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.160
- Going out or coming in.

54:28.080 --> 54:30.320
- Oh, it doesn't say, sorry.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.540
- Don't apologize.

54:33.640 --> 54:34.820
That tea has done me more good

54:34.920 --> 54:36.860
than anything the leaves could tell me.

54:36.960 --> 54:39.700
(laughs) The truth is that
we can never really know

54:39.800 --> 54:41.800
what the future holds.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.820
The only thing we can
control is how we choose

54:45.920 --> 54:47.500
to respond to it,

54:47.600 --> 54:51.280
and I'm going to choose to be brave,

54:54.680 --> 54:57.980
(sighs) to show my quiet, worried boy

54:58.080 --> 55:01.780
that even after the
longest, darkest nights,

55:01.880 --> 55:03.880
there comes a new day,

55:04.840 --> 55:09.520
even after the saddest, hardest
year comes a fresh start.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.620
Thank you, Dora.

55:13.720 --> 55:14.860
- Hang on.

55:14.960 --> 55:17.180
(suspenseful music)

55:17.280 --> 55:19.540
There's one other thing.

55:19.640 --> 55:21.640
That, that boy of yours,

55:22.760 --> 55:24.760
he's going to be a writer,

55:25.640 --> 55:27.620
a very famous writer.

55:27.720 --> 55:29.460
- Is he, indeed?

55:29.560 --> 55:31.560
- But he'll never have a beard.

55:34.280 --> 55:35.500
(Sofie laughs)

55:35.600 --> 55:38.160
- Now that I can believe.

55:43.200 --> 55:47.860
Happy Christmas, Dora.

55:47.960 --> 55:49.820
- Happy Christmas.

55:49.920 --> 55:52.480
(solemn music)

56:00.840 --> 56:03.660
(ethereal music)
(wind whistling)

56:03.760 --> 56:05.380
(ominous music)
(Roald gasping)

56:05.480 --> 56:07.480
- I know you're here,

56:07.800 --> 56:09.800
you little hoodlum.

56:10.400 --> 56:13.640
And you should know that
I have set the dog loose,

56:14.720 --> 56:16.760
and she's not had her dinner yet, either.

56:18.160 --> 56:20.400
So I'd get gone if I were you.

56:23.320 --> 56:25.340
(wood creaking)

56:25.440 --> 56:26.180
(pot clatters)

56:26.280 --> 56:28.780
(dramatic music)

56:28.880 --> 56:31.360
(tense music)

56:36.560 --> 56:38.960
(door thuds)

56:43.280 --> 56:44.500
(tense music)

56:44.600 --> 56:49.700
I'll find you, you
nasty little gutter bug.

56:49.800 --> 56:52.280
(tense music)

56:54.640 --> 56:57.840
And we all know what
happens to gutter bugs.

56:58.720 --> 57:00.660
They get squashed!

57:00.760 --> 57:03.240
(tense music)

57:04.240 --> 57:06.240
Do you hear me?

57:08.600 --> 57:10.600
Squashed!

57:15.120 --> 57:17.840
(dramatic music)

57:21.080 --> 57:23.860
- [Narrator] Oh, Mouse, now what to do?

57:23.960 --> 57:26.420
Is this the end for you too?

57:26.520 --> 57:29.420
There's a witch who won't
stop till you're dead.

57:29.520 --> 57:31.260
She's got you caught in a trap,

57:31.360 --> 57:33.360
and there's no turnin' back.

57:34.080 --> 57:36.280
There'd be nothing to lose, if you fled.

57:43.760 --> 57:45.700
(tense music)

57:45.800 --> 57:47.260
(Fleet barking)

57:47.360 --> 57:48.780
(Fleet snarls)

57:48.880 --> 57:50.300
(Roald gasps)

57:50.400 --> 57:55.400
(Fleet barking)
(tense music)

58:05.080 --> 58:06.300
(gentle music)

58:06.400 --> 58:08.700
(Fleet panting)

58:08.800 --> 58:10.500
- Hello. (laughs)

58:10.600 --> 58:13.200
(gentle music)

58:14.600 --> 58:15.860
(Fleet whimpers)

58:15.960 --> 58:17.960
Nice to meet you, too.

58:21.320 --> 58:23.500
(Roald laughs)

58:23.600 --> 58:25.600
Come on.

58:27.160 --> 58:29.060
Boy.
(Fleet barking)

58:29.160 --> 58:31.700
(Roald laughing)
(Fleet barking)

58:31.800 --> 58:32.940
- I see you.

58:33.040 --> 58:34.700
(Fleet barking)
I see you,

58:34.800 --> 58:36.620
you little blighter.

58:36.720 --> 58:38.900
(Fleet barking)
(Roald yells)

58:39.000 --> 58:41.920
Trespassing is a criminal
offense, you know.

58:43.480 --> 58:44.860
And if the dog won't scare you off,

58:44.960 --> 58:46.900
I'll just have to do it myself,

58:47.000 --> 58:48.060
(Fleet barking)

58:48.160 --> 58:49.340
when I catch you.

58:49.440 --> 58:50.180
(Roald laughing)

58:50.280 --> 58:51.220
(Roald yells)

58:51.320 --> 58:53.580
(Roald thumps)

58:53.680 --> 58:55.740
(Roald groans)

58:55.840 --> 58:58.480
(ominous music)

59:08.080 --> 59:10.380
(Beatrix grunts)

59:10.480 --> 59:12.760
I told you to scram.

59:13.760 --> 59:14.500
(Fleet whimpers)

59:14.600 --> 59:16.460
Oh for goodness sake, dog,

59:16.560 --> 59:18.560
what use are you, really?

59:19.400 --> 59:21.500
Now off my property,

59:21.600 --> 59:22.860
or you'll be going the same way

59:22.960 --> 59:25.520
as the last trespasser around here.

59:26.480 --> 59:29.420
(Roald sighs)

59:29.520 --> 59:31.180
- Is it dead?

59:31.280 --> 59:32.540
- What? This?

59:32.640 --> 59:34.640
Yes, very.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.780
- Did you kill it?

59:36.880 --> 59:38.860
- No, the cat did.

59:38.960 --> 59:40.960
- (sighs) Tom Kitten at it again.

59:44.320 --> 59:46.320
- Might have been.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Doesn't it frighten you?

59:49.880 --> 59:50.860
- Nope.

59:50.960 --> 59:52.740
- Why not?

59:52.840 --> 59:55.020
- Seen more frightening things than that.

59:55.120 --> 59:56.940
- Like what?

59:57.040 --> 1:00:00.460
(dramatic music)

1:00:00.560 --> 1:00:01.940
- Rouge.

1:00:02.040 --> 1:00:03.500
- Rouge?

1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:06.240
What on earth is so
frightening about rouge?

1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:10.380
- Just looks strange
when I saw it on Papa,

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:12.480
when they laid him out.

1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:16.740
- Oh, I see.

1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:18.700
(gentle music)

1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:23.260
I take it he, uh, didn't
wear rouge normally then?

1:00:23.360 --> 1:00:25.360
- Not normally, no.

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:33.360
- So what did you do when
you saw it, the rouge?

1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:36.980
- Just closed my eyes,
scrunched tight, like this.

1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:40.260
(gentle music)

1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:42.360
- Open them.

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:45.900
And if I were you, from now on,

1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.040
I'd keep them open, always.

1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:52.940
Don't miss a thing,

1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:53.940
because when you're small,

1:00:54.040 --> 1:00:56.840
you see it all from a different angle.

1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:00.220
(dramatic music)

1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:02.640
- Well, what happens when you get big?

1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:05.980
(Beatrix sighs)

1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:08.080
- Oh.

1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:12.460
Well, you stop seeing
everything so clearly,

1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:15.220
and it all turns into a bit of a blur.

1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:18.660
And then they make you wear spectacles,

1:01:18.760 --> 1:01:20.460
and so you have to do your very best

1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:22.560
to remember it all instead.

1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:25.780
Luckily for me, I do.

1:01:25.880 --> 1:01:27.880
I remember it all.

1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:36.880
So what on earth are
you doing here anyway?

1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:39.480
- I've come to see Beatrix Potter.

1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:41.340
- Well, there you go.

1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:42.820
You've seen her now.

1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:43.940
So you can buzz off.

1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:46.140
Go on! Scram!

1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:48.840
(gentle music)

1:01:55.200 --> 1:01:56.420
Oh, hang on!

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.380
You've forgotten something!

1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:02.900
(footsteps approaching)
(gentle music)

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.220
(lips smacking)

1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:06.880
(gentle music)

1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:11.800
(Beatrix sighs)

1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:25.940
- [Astri] And please, could you get Roald

1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:28.420
a new Beatrix Potter book.

1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:31.820
He's read me all his
old ones so many times,

1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:34.760
and I'd really like to hear
something new for a change.

1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:39.460
(door thuds)
- Miss Landy.

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:42.500
I have a question to ask you.

1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:44.600
- Please do.

1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:49.700
- Have you actually read any of my books?

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:51.220
- Well, of course.

1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:52.740
Like I said, huge fan.

1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:54.340
- Good, well, then you will know

1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:58.100
that the animals I write
of may well look sweet.

1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:01.220
They may well wear petticoats or bonnets

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:03.300
or little pale-blue jackets,

1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:06.720
but the world they
encounter is all too real,

1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:09.940
just like the children who read my books.

1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:11.300
- Why are you telling me this?

1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:14.300
- Because we cannot shield children

1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:17.820
from the realities of life,

1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:20.060
nor do I choose to.

1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:23.220
In my books, rabbits get caught by farmers

1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:25.100
and baked into pies.

1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:29.300
Hounds charge about and
eat a duck's beloved eggs.

1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:33.020
Rats sometimes even eat kittens,

1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:35.340
or they certainly try to.

1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:37.420
And so far, children have coped

1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:41.260
with all of this and more perfectly well.

1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.740
So thank you for your time.

1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:46.740
But I've changed my mind.

1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:49.560
The line stays as it is.

1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:53.620
And I have it on great authority

1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:57.040
that children have seen
far worse than that.

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:04.100
(knife thuds)
- Good heavens!

1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:06.880
(playful music)

1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:11.060
(Beatrix clears throat)

1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:16.160
(animal snorting)
(playful music)

1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:21.060
Oh, my hat!

1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:22.180
No!

1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:23.620
Can't you stop her?

1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:25.720
- Oh, you can try.

1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:28.940
(Anne groaning)

1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:30.660
Good heavens!

1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:32.760
You put that down at once!

1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:35.960
My hat, don't you eat that!

1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:39.940
My hat!

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:42.220
Bad! Yuck!

1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:44.780
(Beatrix laughs)

1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:46.880
- So did you see her?

1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:48.700
- I'm not sure.

1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:51.420
It might've been her, or
it might've been a witch.

1:04:51.520 --> 1:04:52.580
- A witch?

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:54.820
I see, well, we best be going then,

1:04:54.920 --> 1:04:58.020
before she comes back and
turns us all into, what, toads?

1:04:58.120 --> 1:04:59.780
- Not toads, mice.

1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:02.220
- Yes, mice. Quickly, run!

1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:05.000
(playful music)

1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:14.220
- Mrs. Heelis?
- Mm?

1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:15.780
- We're taking the next
lot of Herdwicks up

1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:18.040
on the fell now, if you're free.

1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:20.620
- I'll be right with you, Tom.

1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:23.500
(gentle music)

1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:25.600
So what's it to be?

1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:28.340
- Fine.

1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:29.620
Have it your way.

1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:31.620
Cut off their tails.

1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:33.720
- Excellent.

1:05:35.880 --> 1:05:38.700
Pleasure doing business
with you, Miss Landy.

1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:40.100
(Beatrix sighs)

1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:42.140
I trust you'll find your own way out.

1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:43.140
- Thank you.

1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:45.600
- You'll have a wonderful
Christmas, won't you?

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:51.460
(door thuds)

1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:54.480
(animals grunting)

1:05:55.960 --> 1:05:56.700
(bright music)

1:05:56.800 --> 1:06:01.080
So, Tom, imagine if one
were to buy Troutbeck Farm.

1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:04.780
- Not likely, Mrs. Heelis.

1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:07.260
I've got enough on my hands
trying to pay off Mrs. Tom's tab

1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:09.100
at the Lamb and Flag, I'll be honest.

1:06:09.200 --> 1:06:10.620
- All right, not one, I.

1:06:10.720 --> 1:06:12.720
Imagine if I were to buy Troutbeck Farm.

1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:15.540
- Then you'd own half of the lakes,

1:06:15.640 --> 1:06:17.860
and you could do as you
please with it, I'd imagine.

1:06:17.960 --> 1:06:20.420
- Like get lots more Herdwicks?

1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:21.620
- You'd have more sheep than they got

1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:23.420
in the whole of London.

1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:27.060
- Again, not really any
sheep in London, Tom.

1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:29.380
- Wouldn't know. Never been.

1:06:29.480 --> 1:06:31.460
- Would you like to go?

1:06:31.560 --> 1:06:34.300
It's only that you do
mention it quite a bit.

1:06:34.400 --> 1:06:36.400
- Me?

1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:38.760
Go to London?

1:06:39.480 --> 1:06:41.760
Not on your nelly!

1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:44.180
- Then perhaps you'll just have

1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:46.840
to look after Troutbeck
Farm, for me, instead.

1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:50.620
- Could do.

1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:52.340
(clears throat) Could do!

1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:54.060
(uplifting music)

1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:56.580
- You go on. I'll catch you up.

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:59.480
(uplifting music)

1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:17.500
- All right then.

1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:18.740
- All right then what?

1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:19.820
- I will go to that school.

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:22.860
At least then I'll have
stories to tell you, won't I?

1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:25.100
- Yes, Roald, you will,

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:27.200
lots and lots.

1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:30.680
(bright music)

1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:34.100
- [Narrator] Now little Mouse knew

1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:36.220
this adventure was through,

1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:38.460
but another was sure to begin,

1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:40.500
for every mouse, great or small,

1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:42.420
there's adventure for us all.

1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:45.720
We just need the courage
and support to jump in.

1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:47.980
But keep in your mind,

1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:49.700
there'll be troubling times

1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:51.460
and days you're not covered in glory.

1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:52.660
- [Mouse] Whee!

1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:54.340
- [Narrator] Then take my advice.

1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:56.300
Learn a lesson from Mouse.

1:07:56.400 --> 1:07:59.000
Don't let the tragic kill all the magic.

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000
Write your own story.

1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:03.500
(door thuds)
(William grunts)

1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:06.260
(Sago quacking)
(William gasping)

1:08:06.360 --> 1:08:07.940
- That's it, Sago!

1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:09.500
I give up.

1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:11.600
You win.

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:14.180
Beatrix!

1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:18.080
Beatrix, we're having cabbage
for Christmas dinner, again.

1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:21.540
(door thuds)

1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:24.280
(Sago quacking)

1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:30.400
(uplifting music)

1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:09.740
- [Beatrix] We have eaten Sago.

1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:10.980
It was rather dreadful,

1:09:11.080 --> 1:09:13.860
and the stuffing disagreed
with my conscience.

1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:16.100
With love and best wishes for Christmas,

1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:17.940
from your affectionate friend,

1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:21.260
Beatrix Potter, Mrs. Heelis.

1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:26.360
(uplifting music)
(singer chanting)

1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:00.840
(solemn digital music)

1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:07.440
(energetic digital music)
(electricity crackling)
