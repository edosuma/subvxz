WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:03.917
Three, two, one!

00:03.959 --> 00:06.917
( Blades laughs )

00:03.959 --> 00:06.917
DANI: Whoo-hoo!

00:06.959 --> 00:08.792
( Blades cheers )

00:11.750 --> 00:14.917
BLADES:

00:11.750 --> 00:14.917
Again, again!

00:18.458 --> 00:20.709
KADE:

00:18.458 --> 00:20.709
One, two, three, four.

00:20.750 --> 00:23.125
Ha! Five skips!

00:23.166 --> 00:26.083
Pfft! I can beat that.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.792
Painting looks great,

00:26.125 --> 00:27.792
Boulder.

00:27.834 --> 00:31.542
Thanks. But Blossom Vale

00:27.834 --> 00:31.542
deserves the credit.

00:31.583 --> 00:33.375
It's so beautiful.

00:35.542 --> 00:38.208
That is due to

00:35.542 --> 00:38.208
82 percent less litter

00:38.250 --> 00:40.250
compared to similar-sized

00:38.250 --> 00:40.250
recreation areas.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.291
People love this place,

00:40.291 --> 00:43.291
so they take care of it.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.333
To think we almost lost

00:43.333 --> 00:45.333
Blossom Vale

00:45.375 --> 00:46.875
to a housing development.

00:46.917 --> 00:49.458
Thankfully the council

00:46.917 --> 00:49.458
refused that offer.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.500
The mayor and his wife

00:49.500 --> 00:51.500
like to snorkel here.

00:51.542 --> 00:53.542
HEATWAVE:

00:51.542 --> 00:53.542
Watch this one! Unh!

00:55.458 --> 00:57.917
How about calling it a tie,

00:55.458 --> 00:57.917
boys?

00:57.959 --> 00:59.875
( both groan )

00:59.917 --> 01:01.250
( beeping )

01:02.959 --> 01:05.875
Ah! Someone fell into

01:02.959 --> 01:05.875
the old Hawkins well.

01:05.917 --> 01:08.500
GIRL:

01:05.917 --> 01:08.500
Mommy?

01:08.542 --> 01:09.959
( all gasp )

01:10.000 --> 01:12.166
( siren wailing )

01:12.208 --> 01:14.834
BURNS:

01:12.208 --> 01:14.834
Okay, everyone, stand back.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.250
Her name's Cathy! Hurry!

01:17.291 --> 01:19.917
Cathy, we're here to help you.

01:19.959 --> 01:21.834
Dad, it's too narrow

01:19.959 --> 01:21.834
for an adult.

01:21.875 --> 01:23.500
Can I try?

01:25.375 --> 01:27.333
It's going to be okay, Cathy.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.917
( gasps )

01:29.959 --> 01:31.875
Cathy!

02:12.500 --> 02:14.542
What's your name?

02:14.583 --> 02:18.291
Ah. Hi, I'm Cody,

02:14.583 --> 02:18.291
and we will get you out.

02:18.333 --> 02:19.792
Somehow.

02:19.834 --> 02:22.417
Pull me up!

02:22.458 --> 02:25.417
( sobbing ):

02:22.458 --> 02:25.417
Cathy.

02:27.291 --> 02:31.333
The sides of the well are

02:27.291 --> 02:31.333
crumbling. We need a new plan.

02:31.375 --> 02:34.500
I have one. Records show

02:31.375 --> 02:34.500
the well is 25 feet deep.

02:34.542 --> 02:37.792
Let's dig a bigger hole next

02:34.542 --> 02:37.792
to it, angled to the bottom.

02:37.834 --> 02:39.166
Do it!

02:39.208 --> 02:41.792
(  dramatic theme playing  )

02:55.125 --> 02:58.000
Power up and energize!

03:04.709 --> 03:07.125
( Kade grunting )

03:07.166 --> 03:09.166
Cathy?

03:09.208 --> 03:12.542
Dani, is she all right?

03:12.583 --> 03:15.291
You can ask her yourself.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.834
My name is Cathy.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.250
Let's have fun!

03:18.291 --> 03:22.208
Yep, we just rescued

03:18.291 --> 03:22.208
a talking doll.

03:22.250 --> 03:23.959
( gasps )

03:25.250 --> 03:26.917
Cathy!

03:26.959 --> 03:28.959
Ew, you got her all dirty.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.583
Mother, will this decrease

03:29.000 --> 03:32.583
her value as a limited edition?

03:32.625 --> 03:35.542
I'm afraid so, sweetheart.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.875
Well, since you

03:35.583 --> 03:37.875
dropped her down there,

03:37.917 --> 03:39.583
you can buy me a new one.

03:41.709 --> 03:44.125
Ms. Pynch?

03:41.709 --> 03:44.125
Oh relax, Charlie.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.333
I'll reimburse the city

03:44.166 --> 03:46.333
for your time.

03:46.375 --> 03:49.458
However,

03:46.375 --> 03:49.458
very impressive robots.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.917
There could be quite

03:50.750 --> 03:53.917
a market for them.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.792
How much for the whole set?

03:55.834 --> 03:58.125
Kind of you to offer, Madeline,

03:55.834 --> 03:58.125
but they're not for sale.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.500
Well, if you ever

03:58.166 --> 04:00.500
change your mind...

04:00.542 --> 04:04.000
Priscilla, dear, we don't

04:00.542 --> 04:04.000
want to be late for tennis.

04:04.041 --> 04:05.583
( scoffs )

04:12.875 --> 04:15.083
I love you.

04:15.125 --> 04:17.125
Aww!

04:19.750 --> 04:21.250
Why so glum, son?

04:21.291 --> 04:24.375
Is that choco-atomic blast

04:21.291 --> 04:24.375
losing its appeal?

04:24.417 --> 04:26.125
Nah, it's just sometimes

04:26.166 --> 04:28.375
the Pynches act like

04:26.166 --> 04:28.375
they own the whole island.

04:28.417 --> 04:31.291
Well, some people are just used

04:28.417 --> 04:31.291
to getting what they want,

04:31.333 --> 04:32.792
no matter who it impacts.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.375
CHASE:

04:32.834 --> 04:34.375
Regarding that, sir.

04:34.417 --> 04:35.792
I'd like to say,

04:35.834 --> 04:37.959
thank you

04:35.834 --> 04:37.959
for not selling us.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You can't sell a partner, Chase.

04:40.041 --> 04:41.667
Or a friend.

04:41.709 --> 04:45.333
( cell phone buzzing )

04:48.458 --> 04:50.875
Someone must've dropped this.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.750
Chief Burns here.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.750
Did you lose a phone?

04:53.792 --> 04:56.208
( static buzzing )

05:00.709 --> 05:03.250
The project

05:00.709 --> 05:03.250
is the priority.

05:03.291 --> 05:05.375
What?

05:05.417 --> 05:08.750
I'll put this into

05:05.417 --> 05:08.750
the lost and found box later.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.959
I need to take care

05:12.250 --> 05:13.959
of something, Cody.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.375
Can you walk home from here?

05:15.417 --> 05:18.375
Uh, sure, I guess.

05:18.417 --> 05:20.792
Bye?

05:24.500 --> 05:27.500
Sir, obviously you didn't see

05:24.500 --> 05:27.500
the trash receptacle next to--

05:27.542 --> 05:29.792
We have something important

05:27.542 --> 05:29.792
to take care of, Chase.

05:29.834 --> 05:31.250
Is it time for

05:29.834 --> 05:31.250
graffiti removal?

05:31.291 --> 05:32.667
Or crossing guard duty?

05:32.709 --> 05:34.583
Or, dare I dream,

05:34.625 --> 05:36.583
disbanding unruly loiterers?

05:36.625 --> 05:38.417
Something like that.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.750
( in robotic tone ):

05:40.375 --> 05:42.750
I repeat,

05:40.375 --> 05:42.750
please evacuate Blossom Vale

05:42.792 --> 05:45.250
in a calm, orderly fashion.

05:45.291 --> 05:47.583
( all chattering )

05:47.625 --> 05:51.208
And do not be alarmed

05:47.625 --> 05:51.208
by the imminent danger.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.875
( all gasp then scream )

05:53.917 --> 05:57.041
( in normal voice ):

05:53.917 --> 05:57.041
Perhaps I should have

05:53.917 --> 05:57.041
phrased that differently.

05:57.083 --> 05:59.959
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

06:11.625 --> 06:13.166
Hey, Dad.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.166
Everything okay?

06:13.208 --> 06:14.625
We hadn't heard

06:13.208 --> 06:14.625
from you in--

06:14.667 --> 06:16.875
I'm wiped out, Cody.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.875
We'll talk tomorrow.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.583
He probably

06:21.750 --> 06:24.583
just had a rough day.

06:24.625 --> 06:26.750
Chase, what were you guys

06:24.625 --> 06:26.750
doing all this time?

06:26.792 --> 06:29.291
Evacuating Blossom Vale.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.291
Chief was adamant

06:29.333 --> 06:31.291
that poisonous sulfur levels

06:31.333 --> 06:32.959
were dangerously high.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.166
What? We were out there!

06:35.208 --> 06:36.834
( coughs )

06:36.875 --> 06:38.375
I knew I wasn't

06:36.875 --> 06:38.375
feeling well.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.458
Sulfur doesn't

06:38.417 --> 06:40.458
bother us, Blades.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.375
Oh.

06:42.417 --> 06:45.083
Well, just knowing it's there

06:42.417 --> 06:45.083
makes me hurt a little inside.

06:45.125 --> 06:48.041
I didn't detect any sulfur

06:45.125 --> 06:48.041
at Blossom Vale this morning.

06:48.083 --> 06:50.375
Nor did I this afternoon.

06:48.083 --> 06:50.375
Nonetheless,

06:50.417 --> 06:53.125
the chief insisted that we--

06:50.417 --> 06:53.125
Hey, if the chief said the Vale

06:53.166 --> 06:56.625
needed to be evacuated,

06:53.166 --> 06:56.625
then it needed to be evacuated.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.208
Something's wrong.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.750
I can feel it.

07:04.041 --> 07:06.875
( snoring )

07:16.959 --> 07:18.625
( snoring )

07:27.834 --> 07:30.125
( buzzing )

07:27.834 --> 07:30.125
What?

07:31.250 --> 07:32.625
Hello?

07:32.667 --> 07:35.083
( static buzzing )

07:35.125 --> 07:37.000
( buzzing )

07:38.959 --> 07:41.792
( static buzzing )

07:45.750 --> 07:47.875
The project

07:45.750 --> 07:47.875
is the priority.

07:47.917 --> 07:50.208
And the priority

07:47.917 --> 07:50.208
is the project.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.250
Dani's still out

07:50.250 --> 07:52.250
on night shift.

07:52.291 --> 07:54.917
She'll have to join us later.

07:52.291 --> 07:54.917
( Cody yawns )

07:54.959 --> 07:56.917
Why's everyone up so early?

07:56.959 --> 07:58.333
We're working on

07:56.959 --> 07:58.333
a little project, Cody.

07:58.375 --> 08:00.834
Go back to sleep.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.166
Those phones

08:00.875 --> 08:03.166
look just like the one

08:03.208 --> 08:05.083
we found at the bus stop.

08:05.125 --> 08:07.792
I'm thinking about

08:05.125 --> 08:07.792
making them standard issue.

08:07.834 --> 08:10.792
Come on, boys,

08:07.834 --> 08:10.792
we're on a schedule.

08:10.834 --> 08:13.709
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

08:18.000 --> 08:19.959
( ringing )

08:20.000 --> 08:22.166
Griffin Rock Emergency.

08:22.208 --> 08:24.500
I'll send someone right away!

08:24.542 --> 08:28.125
CODY ( over radio ):

08:24.542 --> 08:28.125
Kade, we have a car fire

08:24.542 --> 08:28.125
downtown on Waverly.

08:28.166 --> 08:31.125
Kade? Do you--

08:28.166 --> 08:31.125
( shuts off radio )

08:31.166 --> 08:33.583
Hey, why aren't you

08:31.166 --> 08:33.583
answering, Cody?

08:33.625 --> 08:35.333
The project is the priority.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.750
What project?

08:35.375 --> 08:37.750
Blossom Vale.

08:37.792 --> 08:39.375
All right, Kade,

08:37.792 --> 08:39.375
it's high time

08:39.417 --> 08:41.041
I was told

08:39.417 --> 08:41.041
what's going on out there.

08:41.083 --> 08:43.625
No, it's high time

08:41.083 --> 08:43.625
you started following orders

08:43.667 --> 08:45.750
without questioning them!

08:45.792 --> 08:48.083
I dare you to say that again!

08:48.125 --> 08:50.875
Heatwave, we're on a highly

08:48.125 --> 08:50.875
sensitive mission.

08:50.917 --> 08:53.667
No debate,

08:50.917 --> 08:53.667
total radio silence.

08:53.709 --> 08:55.125
Is that understood?

08:55.166 --> 08:56.542
Understood.

08:56.583 --> 08:59.000
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

09:09.875 --> 09:12.625
( yawns )

09:12.667 --> 09:14.458
Dani, we have

09:12.667 --> 09:14.458
an emergency call.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.792
Sorry, Cody, but we just had

09:14.500 --> 09:17.792
a whole night of missing pets,

09:17.834 --> 09:21.166
wandering traffic light bots,

09:17.834 --> 09:21.166
and unruly loiterers.

09:21.208 --> 09:23.834
Shame Chase couldn't join us

09:21.208 --> 09:23.834
on that last one.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.542
But I can't reach anyone else.

09:25.583 --> 09:28.041
( sighs )

09:28.083 --> 09:31.208
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:39.709 --> 09:42.250
That car fire

09:39.709 --> 09:42.250
is now a structure fire.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.709
And my scoop claw

09:42.291 --> 09:44.709
is feeling inadequate.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.583
Where is Heatwave?

09:46.625 --> 09:48.458
Dad? Kade?

09:48.500 --> 09:50.458
Graham! Anybody!

09:50.500 --> 09:53.208
The fire is spreading

09:50.500 --> 09:53.208
out of control!

09:55.959 --> 09:59.208
(  somber theme playing  )

10:09.667 --> 10:12.667
CODY ( over radio ):

10:09.667 --> 10:12.667
I repeat, the fire is

10:09.667 --> 10:12.667
spreading. We need help!

10:12.709 --> 10:14.917
Unh! That does it.

10:16.709 --> 10:20.875
Kade, we're fire fighters.

10:16.709 --> 10:20.875
Why aren't we doing our jobs?

10:20.917 --> 10:22.458
Dani can handle it.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.291
Chief, perhaps

10:22.500 --> 10:24.291
if we understood

10:24.333 --> 10:26.834
the reason why this project

10:24.333 --> 10:26.834
is considered a priority.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.625
And vice versa.

10:28.667 --> 10:31.333
Other than poisonous

10:28.667 --> 10:31.333
sulfur levels,

10:31.375 --> 10:33.542
which don't actually exist.

10:33.583 --> 10:37.250
You're right.

10:33.583 --> 10:37.250
It's time we filled you in.

10:37.291 --> 10:38.875
Graham?

10:38.917 --> 10:40.875
(  tense theme playing  )

10:40.917 --> 10:43.041
( phone beeps )

10:44.500 --> 10:47.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )

10:48.875 --> 10:50.667
We're not even

10:48.875 --> 10:50.667
making a dent.

10:50.709 --> 10:54.709
I wish my knuckles could spray

10:50.709 --> 10:54.709
water like Heatwave's.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.542
Actually, no I don't,

10:54.750 --> 10:57.542
that's kind of weird.

11:01.166 --> 11:03.083
Dani, I have an idea.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.875
Blades, fan the water over

11:07.000 --> 11:09.875
the fire with your tail rotor.

11:09.917 --> 11:11.875
Heh-heh.

11:09.917 --> 11:11.875
Like that's gonna work.

11:17.917 --> 11:21.458
( crowd cheering )

11:21.500 --> 11:22.959
I knew it would work!

11:23.000 --> 11:24.917
Hey, nice call, Cody!

11:24.959 --> 11:27.834
As much as I loved

11:24.959 --> 11:27.834
honing that fire,

11:27.875 --> 11:30.375
who's gonna fix the hydrant?

11:30.417 --> 11:32.500
Or tow that wreck?

11:30.417 --> 11:32.500
Or direct traffic?

11:32.542 --> 11:34.417
Apparently not my family.

11:34.458 --> 11:36.875
I can't believe Dad would

11:34.458 --> 11:36.875
ever be okay with this.

11:36.917 --> 11:38.542
Dad isn't acting like Dad.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.834
Yesterday,

11:38.583 --> 11:40.834
he closed down Blossom Vale

11:40.875 --> 11:42.792
and made up a reason why.

11:42.834 --> 11:44.917
Blossom Vale, huh?

11:44.959 --> 11:47.959
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

11:49.625 --> 11:51.125
( both grunting )

11:57.166 --> 11:59.583
( all grunting )

12:00.709 --> 12:03.709
(  ominous theme playing  )

12:09.041 --> 12:12.000
It's positive.

12:09.041 --> 12:12.000
I'll call it in.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.917
Bring more just like this one.

12:13.959 --> 12:15.875
ALL:

12:13.959 --> 12:15.875
Yes, sir.

12:15.917 --> 12:18.792
(  heroic theme playing  )

12:23.333 --> 12:26.750
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

12:26.792 --> 12:29.834
Guys, why are you

12:26.792 --> 12:29.834
digging up Blossom Vale?

12:29.875 --> 12:31.417
( Heatwave grunts )

12:31.458 --> 12:33.875
This is our priority.

12:33.917 --> 12:36.542
Says who?

12:33.917 --> 12:36.542
BURNS: Me.

12:38.417 --> 12:40.667
Dad, we've been trying

12:38.417 --> 12:40.667
to reach you.

12:40.709 --> 12:42.208
What is going on here?

12:42.250 --> 12:44.500
Ground contamination.

12:44.542 --> 12:47.000
You're just in time

12:44.542 --> 12:47.000
to help, Dani.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.583
I'll check

12:47.041 --> 12:48.583
Blades' scoop claw

12:48.625 --> 12:50.792
to confirm

12:48.625 --> 12:50.792
it can handle the weight.

12:52.375 --> 12:53.667
Wait. Hold on.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.083
Exactly how is

12:53.709 --> 12:55.083
moving dirt around

12:55.125 --> 12:56.917
more important

12:55.125 --> 12:56.917
than a fire downtown?

12:56.959 --> 13:01.083
The entire island is at risk

12:56.959 --> 13:01.083
because of Blossom Vale.

13:01.125 --> 13:04.542
You aren't questioning

13:01.125 --> 13:04.542
my judgment, are you, Dani?

13:04.583 --> 13:06.375
Uh, no.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.500
I'm just confused, Dad.

13:08.542 --> 13:11.709
Here, these new phones

13:08.542 --> 13:11.709
have a secure line

13:11.750 --> 13:14.291
so we can communicate

13:11.750 --> 13:14.291
without anyone listening in.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.041
Let's test the connection.

13:17.792 --> 13:21.000
(  eerie theme playing  )

13:22.250 --> 13:24.000
The project

13:22.250 --> 13:24.000
is the priority.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.041
And the priority

13:24.041 --> 13:26.041
is the project.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.667
Dani, no!

13:27.583 --> 13:29.667
It's the phones!

13:29.709 --> 13:31.291
I think they're

13:29.709 --> 13:31.291
hypnotizing people.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.917
( buzzing )

13:34.959 --> 13:36.417
Answer it, Dani.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.083
Uh...

13:38.125 --> 13:40.542
thanks, but I'm good

13:38.125 --> 13:40.542
with the com-units.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.375
Ah! Run!

13:45.083 --> 13:46.875
What now?

13:46.917 --> 13:48.959
We find Doc Greene,

13:46.917 --> 13:48.959
and then--

13:49.000 --> 13:51.125
( static buzzing over helmet )

13:51.166 --> 13:53.709
The project is the priority.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.709
( gasps )

13:53.750 --> 13:57.750
And the priority is the

13:53.750 --> 13:57.750
project. Help us, Cody.

13:57.792 --> 14:01.166
Yes, Cody. Help us.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.250
( panting )

14:08.458 --> 14:10.542
He could

14:08.458 --> 14:10.542
jeopardize everything.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.959
He won't.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.542
Dani,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.542
the freighter's waiting.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.417
We're behind schedule.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.542
Understood.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.458
( panting )

14:24.291 --> 14:26.333
Hello there, Cody.

14:26.375 --> 14:28.250
Doc, something's wrong.

14:28.291 --> 14:31.166
My family's in some kind

14:28.291 --> 14:31.166
of trance. The bots too.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.166
That sounds serious.

14:33.208 --> 14:35.959
We'd better meet

14:33.208 --> 14:35.959
at Town Hall.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.959
Don't worry, Cody.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.583
We told the mayor

14:45.000 --> 14:47.583
all about the phones.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.041
He's waiting for you.

14:50.083 --> 14:54.542
(  ominous theme playing  )

14:54.583 --> 14:57.583
But I never told you

14:54.583 --> 14:57.583
about the phones.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.291
You see, Cody,

15:02.333 --> 15:04.792
your father came

15:02.333 --> 15:04.792
to see us this morning.

15:04.834 --> 15:08.875
It would be so much easier

15:04.834 --> 15:08.875
if you just joined us.

15:08.917 --> 15:11.208
Otherwise...

15:11.250 --> 15:15.000
We have to keep you from

15:11.250 --> 15:15.000
endangering the project.

15:15.041 --> 15:17.792
(  ominous theme playing  )

15:21.917 --> 15:24.291
(  ominous theme playing  )

15:27.333 --> 15:30.291
Aah!

15:27.333 --> 15:30.291
We won't hurt you, Cody.

15:37.792 --> 15:40.417
I lost him!

15:37.792 --> 15:40.417
Spread out!

15:47.375 --> 15:49.667
I knew it.

15:49.709 --> 15:51.750
He's in the storm drain!

15:51.792 --> 15:53.291
Frankie!

15:56.166 --> 15:57.875

15:59.083 --> 16:01.792
This one's good to go.

( Boulder grunts )

16:23.500 --> 16:24.959
Wha--?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.041
What's happening?

16:31.625 --> 16:34.083
It's about priorities, Boulder.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.959
( gasps )

16:40.709 --> 16:42.333
The marina?

16:42.375 --> 16:45.333
Doc, do not let Cody

16:42.375 --> 16:45.333
take a boat off the island.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.166
Cody.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.542
( gasps )

16:54.959 --> 16:57.417
( gasps )

16:59.542 --> 17:02.625
Shh. It's okay.

16:59.542 --> 17:02.625
I'm myself again.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.333
Oh, yeah? Prove it!

17:04.375 --> 17:06.458
What's your favorite way

17:04.375 --> 17:06.458
to spend Saturday afternoon?

17:06.500 --> 17:08.417
Painting, usually.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.667
Do some research,

17:08.458 --> 17:10.667
maybe listen to music.

17:10.709 --> 17:12.333
Okay, it's you.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.875
Actually,

17:12.375 --> 17:13.875
I would have accepted

17:13.917 --> 17:16.500
any answer other than

17:13.917 --> 17:16.500
"dig up Blossom Vale."

17:16.542 --> 17:18.417
I think I know

17:16.542 --> 17:18.417
how to snap everyone else

17:18.458 --> 17:19.959
out of their trances.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.083
Smash their phones.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.291
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

17:31.667 --> 17:34.375
I have been dispatched

17:31.667 --> 17:34.375
to assist in the search.

17:34.417 --> 17:36.041
Comb this area.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.750
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

17:45.375 --> 17:47.834
I think they believed me.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.750
I just don't understand how

17:47.875 --> 17:50.750
phones can hypnotize people.

17:50.792 --> 17:54.125
It must be the tone they emit

17:50.792 --> 17:54.125
when a call is answered.

17:54.166 --> 17:56.125
So the phone instructed Dad

17:56.166 --> 17:58.542
to recruit everyone

17:56.166 --> 17:58.542
to help dig up Blossom Vale.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.709
And to stop anyone

17:58.583 --> 18:00.709
who gets in the way.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.458
But why?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.542
They must be in the pit.

18:06.583 --> 18:09.625
Okay, we jump down there

18:06.583 --> 18:09.625
and crush Dad's phone.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.750
Then he can help us

18:09.667 --> 18:11.750
with the others.

18:14.417 --> 18:17.000
(  tense theme playing  )

18:18.792 --> 18:22.250
You should know by now, son,

18:18.792 --> 18:22.250
you can't fool Frankie.

18:22.291 --> 18:23.959
Smart girl.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.583
Boulder, run!

(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:29.000 --> 18:31.875
BOULDER:

18:29.000 --> 18:31.875
Now how are we going to

18:29.000 --> 18:31.875
disable everyone's phones?

18:35.333 --> 18:37.959
We won't have to.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.959
Not if we disable that!

18:39.458 --> 18:42.125
The cell tower.

18:39.458 --> 18:42.125
We'll knock out the signal

18:42.166 --> 18:44.792
for every mobile phone

18:42.166 --> 18:44.792
on the island.

18:48.417 --> 18:50.792
They're heading

18:48.417 --> 18:50.792
for the cell tower!

18:53.875 --> 18:57.709
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:12.917 --> 19:14.834
Cody, hang on!

19:16.750 --> 19:18.709
( Boulder grunting )

19:24.959 --> 19:29.041
Run, Cody!

19:24.959 --> 19:29.041
I'll hold them back.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.709
Wait!

19:30.750 --> 19:32.959
( cell phones powering down )

19:39.583 --> 19:41.041
( groans )

19:39.583 --> 19:41.041
Wha-- What happened?

19:41.083 --> 19:43.125
Uh, what?

19:41.083 --> 19:43.125
Ugh.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.750
( all groaning )

19:50.375 --> 19:52.667
Cody, I'm so sorry.

19:52.709 --> 19:54.375
I don't remember anything,

19:54.417 --> 19:55.792
except you and I

19:54.417 --> 19:55.792
having ice cream.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.709
You disposed of

19:55.834 --> 19:57.709
your cone improperly.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.500
I should have known immediately

19:57.750 --> 20:00.500
something was amiss.

20:00.542 --> 20:02.542
Someone planted that phone

20:00.542 --> 20:02.542
on the bench, Dad,

20:02.583 --> 20:04.166
just so you'd find it.

20:04.208 --> 20:07.667
A phone that hypnotizes

20:04.208 --> 20:07.667
people to carry out orders?

20:07.709 --> 20:10.083
I can't believe

20:07.709 --> 20:10.083
tech like that even exists.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.250
And that it worked on bots.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.083
That's dangerous science.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.458
I feel so used.

20:16.500 --> 20:20.208
But why would someone

20:16.500 --> 20:20.208
want to dig up Blossom Vale?

20:24.959 --> 20:27.667
Gold. Lots of it.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.375
I wonder where

20:27.709 --> 20:29.375
they took it all.

20:29.417 --> 20:31.333
Uh, I mean,

20:29.417 --> 20:31.333
where we took it.

20:31.375 --> 20:34.291
Isn't it weird that a company

20:31.375 --> 20:34.291
tried to buy Blossom Vale

20:34.333 --> 20:35.959
right before

20:34.333 --> 20:35.959
all this happened?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.041
It's like they knew

20:36.000 --> 20:38.041
the gold was here.

20:38.083 --> 20:39.750
And when they couldn't

20:38.083 --> 20:39.750
buy the land,

20:39.792 --> 20:42.208
they used those phones to

20:39.792 --> 20:42.208
get us to do their dirty work.

20:42.250 --> 20:45.500
However long it takes, we'll

20:42.250 --> 20:45.500
find whoever's responsible.

20:45.542 --> 20:48.333
We did this.

20:45.542 --> 20:48.333
We can fix it.

20:48.375 --> 20:50.333
We'll fill in the pit,

20:48.375 --> 20:50.333
plant trees--

20:50.375 --> 20:52.333
And use my painting

20:50.375 --> 20:52.333
as a guide.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.667
I suggest

20:52.375 --> 20:54.667
we begin post-haste.

20:54.709 --> 20:56.959
Looks like

20:54.709 --> 20:56.959
we'll have some help.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.417
CODY:

21:01.083 --> 21:03.417
Like I said,

21:01.083 --> 21:03.417
people love this place,

21:03.458 --> 21:05.375
so they take care of it.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.000
PRISCILLA:

21:10.500 --> 21:12.000
Mommy.

21:12.041 --> 21:14.625
Look what

21:12.041 --> 21:14.625
I found under the seat.

21:14.667 --> 21:17.750
It's so shiny.

21:14.667 --> 21:17.750
I want it!

21:17.792 --> 21:19.917
Sorry, dear.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.083
I instructed my company

21:19.959 --> 21:22.083
to recall this model.

21:23.542 --> 21:26.959
The signal needs to be

21:23.542 --> 21:26.959
much stronger.

21:29.792 --> 21:32.792
(  dramatic theme playing  )
