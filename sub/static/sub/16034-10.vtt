WEBVTT

01:01.080 --> 01:03.059
(Mine bell clangs)

01:32.360 --> 01:36.308
Can scarce sleep at night, for dreaming
ofthe lode and wanting to get back to her.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.108
'Tis a miracle. A mine that do actually pay.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.226
And notjust pay. Yields riches.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.745
- Your gamble has paid off.
- Our gamble.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.139
There are soldiers in the village
looking for men to enlist.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.902
And we thought war couldn't touch us here.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.869
(Horse whinnies, musket fire)

02:03.040 --> 02:05.019
(Soldiers cry out)

02:06.680 --> 02:08.705
(Cannons rumble)

02:13.800 --> 02:15.904
He plays beautifully by himself.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.059
Yet it's a lonely thing...

02:21.080 --> 02:23.059
..to be an only child.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.543
Oh... must it go?

02:30.720 --> 02:32.938
I think Geoffrey Charles will miss it.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.146
But my dear,
this is where I hoped that my gift to you...

02:36.320 --> 02:39.869
- Which?
- A portrait of us both.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.146
Painted by the celebrated John Opie.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.787
You spoil me.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.348
Hm.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.545
(Knocks)

02:49.720 --> 02:51.142
Would you excuse me, my dear?

02:58.400 --> 03:01.665
How long will Uncle George stay, Mama?

03:01.840 --> 03:04.502
Oh, sweetheart.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.148
Uncle George lives here now.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.584
You must think of him as your new papa.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.019
- What be going on here?
- Hop it!

03:27.280 --> 03:30.829
- This be private land.
- Since when?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.468
Since Mr Warleggan be master here.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.019
He can't do that. This is open land.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.383
- No longer!
- Aargh!

03:38.560 --> 03:40.903
- (Woman shrieks)
- Mr Warleggan will have 'ee hanged

03:41.080 --> 03:42.661
if he sees thee here again.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.260
Is...is that wise?

03:46.440 --> 03:49.546
A man _who owns land_
has the right to enclose It.

03:49.720 --> 03:53.907
But... to use force needlessly
is to court enemies.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.945
Are you becoming squeamish?

03:56.120 --> 03:59.100
I merely question the virtue of
provoking one's neighbours.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.259
Great or small.

04:20.080 --> 04:22.822
Are you sure it was on Warleggan orders?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.345
Look at Jory, look at Dan.
Do you not recognise the handiwork?

04:26.520 --> 04:28.499
You also tried to cross at Trenwith Land?

04:28.680 --> 04:31.228
Warleggan thinks he can do as he please.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.459
- He needs reining in.
MAN: Hear, hear.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.700
Well, who's to do it?
The man owns halfthe county.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.587
Them Frenchies have the right idea,
eh, Dr Enys.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.625
I used to think so.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.189
What began as a just cause
has since become a bloodbath.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.941
'Twill happen here soon enough.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.509
- (Laughter)
- Mark my words.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.541
Demelza!

05:06.080 --> 05:08.059
Give me your hand.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.584
Cast your mind back a 12 month.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.667
How many times did we think all was lost?

05:30.280 --> 05:32.748
You'd surely not wish to be back there again?

05:37.600 --> 05:40.262
(Coins jingle and clatter)

05:41.280 --> 05:43.259
Would I not, Ross?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.419
(Ticking)

05:58.360 --> 06:00.180
- Drink?
- Regularly.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.384
Wine?

06:01.560 --> 06:03.539
Canary.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.585
Appetite?

06:05.760 --> 06:07.546
Voracious.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.665
Udne?

06:10.840 --> 06:12.705
Unusually sweet.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.269
So Doctor Choake informs me.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.658
- And his diagnosis?
- Oh.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.183
The fever then the gout.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.341
Wasting disease. Tuberculosis infection.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.863
You anything to add?

06:28.040 --> 06:30.622
Only that I believe him to be utterly mistaken.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.301
It is the sugar sickness.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.584
The symptoms are unmistakable.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.707
- What must I do?
- Give up most ofthe things you eat and drink.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.745
Wine especially.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.899
And that'll cure me, will it?

06:44.920 --> 06:48.060
No. But it may prolong your life.

06:50.640 --> 06:54.144
Will my life be worth living?
It hardly sounds like it.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.307
- Doctor Enys?
-Hm?

07:00.480 --> 07:02.744
You and I did not part as friends.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.346
_So I'm all the more_
obliged to you for coming.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.302
But I feel it only fair to tell you that...

07:12.480 --> 07:17.588
Caroline will shortly be engaged
to Lord Coniston...

07:18.680 --> 07:21.148
..eldest son of Earl Windermere.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.139
I congratulate Miss Penvenen.

07:27.160 --> 07:30.140
I do hope this information
will not now distress you.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.981
Not in the least, sir.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.548
I bid you good day.

07:57.240 --> 08:00.425
Are you quite clear, Dr Enys,
what you are signing up for?

08:00.600 --> 08:05.219
The duration ofthe war? Which you assure me
will be long, desperate and bloody.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.824
I may not return to these shores for years.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.979
Or indeed, at all.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.621
Where do I sign?

08:28.360 --> 08:30.146
(Grunts)

08:36.640 --> 08:40.383
I wonder, is it wise to seek more confrontation?

08:40.560 --> 08:44.542
Is there or is_there not some doubt
over the legality ofthIs arrangement?

08:44.720 --> 08:49.066
Ah, my clear. The sale of Geoffrey Charles's
shares in Wheal Grace.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.060
We fear it might have been fraudulent.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.220
Do you recall Ross mentioning
any new shareholders?

08:55.960 --> 08:59.748
You must know I have had no dealings
with Ross since before our marriage.

09:03.200 --> 09:07.227
Of course, my dear. Do not distress yourself.
Leave me to deal with the matter.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.867
Dear Poldark...

09:15.040 --> 09:18.783
as you are a trustee of Francis's estate,

09:18.960 --> 09:24.227
perhaps you might shed light
on certain recent transactions

09:24.400 --> 09:26.584
which appear troubling.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.620
Dear Warleggan, as you are not
a trustee of Francis's estate,

09:32.800 --> 09:36.543
I do not considerthe business
In any way concerns you.

09:37.560 --> 09:41.428
Dear Poldark, it may have escaped your notice
that Elizabeth and I are now married.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.468
In attending to Francis's estate,
I am merely trying to take the burden off her.

09:45.640 --> 09:49.019
She has been unwell _
and would prefer to meet you at TrenWIth

09:49.200 --> 09:51.464
if you could trouble yourselfto attend.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.139
(Door unbolted and opens)

10:28.320 --> 10:30.584
These are pleasant times, Nephew.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.979
No peasant safe from assault?

10:35.600 --> 10:38.103
Or is thatjust our house?

10:38.280 --> 10:40.498
You need not remain here, Aunt.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.983
Come and live at Nampara.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.309
And let that upstart win?

10:49.480 --> 10:50.868
(Scoffs)

11:00.880 --> 11:06.625
We need not take much of your time, provided
you can supply sufficient explanation.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.062
Where's Elizabeth?

11:08.240 --> 11:11.027
Resting.
We can complete the business without her.

11:11.200 --> 11:15.261
I think not. She is co-trustee in his estate.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.783
I shall do nothing without her presence.

11:19.440 --> 11:25.629
Well, she has signed a power of attorney
so that I may act on her behalf.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.101
At her request.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.224
Since she wants nothing more to do with you.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.899
- Shall we get on?
- Hm.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.259
The half share in Wheal Grace,

11:51.440 --> 11:54.819
held on behalf of Mrs Warleggan's son,
Geoffrey Charles,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.582
- disposed of at the beginning ofthe year.
- What of it?

11:57.760 --> 12:00.979
We're not satisfied
that the transaction was legal.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.785
It was legal.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.064
Mrs Poldar...

12:07.240 --> 12:13.668
Mrs Warleggan received 600 on behalf
of her son for a half share in a worthless mine.

12:13.840 --> 12:17.424
And who was so foolish as to pay her that sum?

12:18.440 --> 12:20.419
I was.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.263
In January, Elizabeth was in dire straits.

12:24.440 --> 12:28.228
Having persuaded Francis
to sink his last 600 into the mine,

12:28.400 --> 12:31.949
I felt duty bound to give it back to Elizabeth.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.907
Knowing she would not accept
the money as a gif,

12:35.080 --> 12:37.628
I devised a strategy to do so
without her knowing.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.219
GEORGE:
But circumstances have since changed.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.858
- What you took from Elizabeth and her son...
- Purchased.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.702
..is now worth more than what you gave for it.

12:48.880 --> 12:52.338
Should you now not return the half share
ofthis successful mine

12:52.520 --> 12:54.829
into the custody ofthe child's trustees?

12:56.240 --> 12:58.344
In other words...you.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.546
As his adopted father,
naturally I would manage his affairs.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.985
Last January, had the Wheal Grace stock
come on to the market,

13:05.160 --> 13:07.663
it would not have fetched 10.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.547
The mine was finished.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.745
We kept her going through winter.

13:12.920 --> 13:17.380
And with our bare hands
we reopened her after a catastrophic rock fall.

13:24.280 --> 13:28.307
And against all odds, we struck tin.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.587
So now, I deem the profit mine...

13:32.760 --> 13:34.625
..not Elizabeth's.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.859
Not Geoffrey Charles's.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.179
And most especially not yours.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.828
So unless you have anything else to add...

13:45.880 --> 13:50.579
Only that you may wish to consider
how poorly this reflects on you.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.263
A man who cheats his young ward.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.863
Up to now, I have offered no violence.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.627
But if you persist...

14:00.320 --> 14:02.538
You would not dare lay a finger on me.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.267
Because your army of servants will protect you?

14:09.680 --> 14:11.659
Go back to your scullery maid.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.986
Kemp! Harry! Triggs! In here now!

15:07.880 --> 15:09.268
Get this man out of my house!

15:09.440 --> 15:11.783
Your house? Your house?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.939
This is Geoffrey Charles's house!

15:24.800 --> 15:26.859
I can walk. I can walk!

15:29.040 --> 15:31.827
JEREMY: Aaaah!
- Good...

15:36.120 --> 15:39.339
A mild colic. I'll mix him a sedative.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.944
- Come to old Prudie, Master Jeremy.
- Go on, then.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.099
See what she have for you now.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.668
- You'll stay until Ross returns?
- Of course.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.819
I have some news.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.388
I've applied for a post
as a surgeon in the Naw.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.425
I expect to leave any day.

15:56.600 --> 16:00.184
- Oh, but, Dwight...
- I must gain more experience.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.339
And the war will surely supply that.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.466
And besides, I've had news of Caroline.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.780
- She's to be married.
- To a Lord Coniston.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.348
- I'm that sorry.
- I'm not.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.943
It was the spur I needed to put her behind me.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.541
But you did love her.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.106
We would never have been happy.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.259
We're too dissimilar.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.219
Judas. What happened?

16:42.040 --> 16:44.019
It's a scratch.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.779
Nothing compared to what I gave Ross.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.019
I hope he will have learnt his lesson.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.584
Are you angry?

17:29.760 --> 17:31.739
Little boys fighting?

17:31.920 --> 17:34.343
- He was offensive.
- (Scoffss)

17:34.520 --> 17:36.499
About someone other than myself.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.499
I can scarce believe we're losing Dwight.

17:48.680 --> 17:49.783
Nor I.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.580
It makes me wonder if I should go.

17:55.760 --> 17:59.309
Why? Cos your dearest friend
is running away, so must you?

17:59.480 --> 18:01.061
Because I'm a soldier.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.788
And if my regiment requires me...

18:06.160 --> 18:08.378
Obviously the thought of leaving you
and Jeremy...

18:08.560 --> 18:12.018
It wouldn't be the first time
you've considered such a thing.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.105
How was Elizabeth?

18:17.920 --> 18:19.899
She avoided me.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.619
- And you've avoided her.
- What would you have me do?

18:24.800 --> 18:27.109
I'd have you be honest, Ross.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.419
To her. To me. To yourself.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.465
Am I not honest?

18:31.640 --> 18:33.619
Where am I not honest now?

18:34.720 --> 18:37.666
Go to war, Ross. Play soldiers.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.422
Or stay home and save all of Cornwall.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.509
What it is to be married to such a great man.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.099
Letter come.
And Mr Ross d'ride to Truro.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.949
(Clears throat) There. You hold that.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.144
My dear Demelza, as my time draws near ,

19:54.320 --> 19:57.619
I am both excited and afeared
In equal measure.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.979
How I wish I had your strength
to see me through.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.220
How fortunate you are
to have Ross always at your side.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.219
Yes, how fortunate.

20:25.080 --> 20:30.666
Rejoin your regiment? Just as your mine
begins to prosper and your family is secure?

20:30.840 --> 20:33.582
It's because we're secure
that I'd conSIder gorng.

20:33.760 --> 20:37.309
Obviously, I'd need to put
my affairs in order first.

20:38.320 --> 20:43.383
Beginning with George. He's contesting the sale
of my nephew's shares in Wheal Grace.

20:43.560 --> 20:47.348
The deal was entirely legal.
But that may not deter him.

20:47.520 --> 20:52.742
He has the funds_to finance a lawsuit
and to drag It out for years.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.785
I've had my fill of court.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.825
But what could be his purpose?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.902
To get his hands on Grace the way
he did Leisure. Especially now she prospers.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.184
Which reminds me.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.499
- My mystery benefactor.
- Yes?

21:07.680 --> 21:09.545
I wish to repay him.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.824
So tell me his name.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.140
- You recall the loan was given in confidence.
- Oh, come, Harris.

21:15.320 --> 21:19.859
I cannot go away to war without thanking him
in person. So who is he?

21:20.040 --> 21:22.747
Well, as to that...

21:22.920 --> 21:27.220
I don't recall ever mentioning a "he"... at all.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.667
Caroline Penvenen?

21:30.840 --> 21:33.343
Dwight must have told her about our business.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.305
Is that not astonishing?

21:37.480 --> 21:39.584
I dare say she's taken a fancy to you.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.387
I'm a married man.

21:41.560 --> 21:45.064
- And that would make all the difference?
- Oh, Demelza.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.662
It was one night.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.149
How long will it take you to forgive me?

21:49.320 --> 21:51.299
I don't know, Ross.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.939
How long would it take you to forgive me?

21:59.120 --> 22:03.989
That's hardly the same. You would never do
a thing which required my forgiveness.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.469
Are you sure?

22:17.200 --> 22:18.269
VVhen?

22:18.440 --> 22:23.104
Werry House. After the ball,
Captain McNeil came to my room.

22:23.280 --> 22:25.259
How could he dare?

22:25.440 --> 22:27.465
Because I invited him.

22:27.640 --> 22:32.703
After your antics with Elizabeth,
I decided I might have a turn myself.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.745
A turn?

22:34.920 --> 22:38.265
- How far did you...?
- Oh, kisses, caresses.

22:38.440 --> 22:42.308
- And then I sent him away.
- Good God, Demelza. Was that not enough?

22:43.360 --> 22:46.102
I tell you, I do not admire you for this.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.187
It does you no credit. Nor me neither.

22:50.360 --> 22:53.067
What credit did your night with Elizabeth do me?

22:53.240 --> 22:56.220
- That's entirely different.
- How is it different?

22:56.400 --> 22:59.267
I take no pride in my visit to her.

22:59.440 --> 23:03.422
It_was the outcome of a devotion
which, on my Side, lasted ten years!

23:03.600 --> 23:06.182
Not some tawdry little passion
worked up over a glass of port

23:06.360 --> 23:08.942
with some opportunist soldier
who took what was on offer.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.702
That is precisely not what was on offer.
I did not permit him.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.859
How do I know what you permitted?

23:16.520 --> 23:20.149
You're right, Ross.
How do you know?

23:20.320 --> 23:24.302
Ifyou trust me not and I trust you not,
then what is the point in this marriage at all?

23:28.320 --> 23:30.299
I entirely agree.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.939
What is the point?

23:49.320 --> 23:50.981
DEMELZA: Right, let's get going.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.344
JUD: At this time of night?

24:06.920 --> 24:10.947
Welcome, ma'am. My father is at sea
so has asked me to be here in his stead.

24:12.240 --> 24:15.619
- We expect the confinement any day.
- Oh, Verity!

24:17.640 --> 24:19.028
This is a turnabout.

24:19.200 --> 24:24.263
Andrew insisted I was not to be left unattended,
but that she should be the one to come.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.342
Ross? I came to tell you...

24:40.800 --> 24:42.825
Ross?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.662
- You surely don't intend...?
- Am I not a soldier?

24:45.840 --> 24:49.469
With a family, a prosperous mine, a settled life.

24:50.480 --> 24:54.462
But perhaps that's the problem.
You're so blessed you've nothing to fight for.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.585
What does Demelza say?

24:56.760 --> 24:59.183
- Does she even know?
- She Will know soon enough.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.908
Whenever she returns.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.707
Dwight... (Clears his throat)

25:03.880 --> 25:08.544
..I must tell you...
my mysterious benefactor...

25:09.680 --> 25:11.022
..is Caroline.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.380
How? Why would she...?

25:16.920 --> 25:20.219
I can only apologise if I spoke too freely
ofyour business affairs.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.868
I can only express my gratitude that you did.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.826
I owe you both more than I can say.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.104
Together you saved me and in return...

25:29.280 --> 25:31.145
I can assure you, I have no regrets.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.107
And nor, it appears, does Caroline.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.019
And now we may be brothers in arms.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.941
My...er...my posting is through.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.384
HMS Travail. I leave for Plymouth tomorrow.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.979
God speed.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.469
And good luck.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.779
She's growing used to me.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.665
Am I not the luckiest ofwomen?

26:03.840 --> 26:05.819
- The most deserving.
- And you?

26:06.840 --> 26:08.467
Lord knows what I deserve.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.499
How is Ross?

26:17.400 --> 26:22.383
At war with himself.
And the idea of George at Trenwith.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.424
I too struggle with the idea of my family home
in the hands of a Warleggan.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.819
But Elizabeth has made her choice.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.979
(Gasps in pain)

26:39.040 --> 26:41.429
It's nothing. It's like cramp.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.625
It's been happening since last night.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.899
It may not be nothing.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.819
(Urges on horses)

27:15.280 --> 27:17.225
Some say the devil's dead...

27:17.400 --> 27:20.187
An' buried in Fowey harbour

27:20.360 --> 27:23.227
Some say he'm alive again

27:23.400 --> 27:25.459
An' wedded to a barber...

27:34.320 --> 27:36.504
(Continues screaming)

27:38.440 --> 27:40.226
(Chuckles)

28:21.280 --> 28:24.386
Captain Poldark. What a treat.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.267
Yet I see no flags out for your visit.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.419
They put the flags out when I leave!

28:31.720 --> 28:33.699
Tell me all the news of Cornwall.

28:48.400 --> 28:53.702
My dear Elizabeth, this news has made me
the happiest of men.

28:57.680 --> 29:02.060
- So, what brings you to London?
- I need to see justice done.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.822
My mine has begun to prosper.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.299
It was your loan which enabled me
to keep it open till we struck tin.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.664
- My loan?
- There's no point denying it.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.582
So now, you stand accused ofwilfully saving

29:14.760 --> 29:18.901
three people from the worst disaster
bankruptcy can bring.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.981
- And what is my sentence?
- To bear the brunt of my eternal gratitude.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.981
And to shortly take receipt of repayment in full.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.503
So, instead ofthanking me,

29:29.680 --> 29:33.025
you should be congratulating me
on my shrewd business sense.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.942
I believe congratulations of another sort are due.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.179
Your engagement to Lord Coniston.

29:40.040 --> 29:43.828
Arthur has made me several offers of marriage
which I have so far declined.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.022
May I ask why?

29:48.200 --> 29:50.589
The usual capriciousness of my sex.

29:50.760 --> 29:53.661
And, presumably, you do not love him.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.705
As you say, I do not love him.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.543
In fact, it's probable you still love Dwight Enys.

30:04.440 --> 30:07.864
Since you left, he has been unable to settle.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.905
Oh, and he has no idea I'm here.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.538
And had he known,
he would certainly have forbidden me.

30:13.720 --> 30:17.224
But I thought you should know that
he has joined the Naw.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.379
(Man plays a jig on his fiddle)

30:27.200 --> 30:29.179
(Ribald laughter)

30:31.280 --> 30:33.259
(Lively chatter)

30:44.200 --> 30:46.942
- Doctor Enys, welcome to the Navy.
- Thank you.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.747
Let me get you a drink.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.706
Douglas?

30:54.280 --> 30:57.101
- Why have you come here?
- To ask you why you left Cornwall.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.908
And why you refused Dwight a second chance

31:00.080 --> 31:02.298
after he explained what happened
the night ofthe ambush.

31:02.480 --> 31:06.587
Did you not see him?
In the weeks before we were due to elope?

31:06.760 --> 31:10.742
He behaved as if he were contemplating
something shameful.

31:12.040 --> 31:17.228
Deserting his beloved patients in the
middle ofthe night for the fleshpots of Bath.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.187
Could you not have returned to Cornwall?
Defied your uncle?

31:20.360 --> 31:23.625
Lived in a cottage? Dined on sprats?

31:25.400 --> 31:29.825
In asking Dwight to leave Cornwall,
I was expecting too much of him.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.743
Since I have left Cornwall, I have realised
I was asking too much of myself.

31:33.920 --> 31:37.265
So, in effect, your love could not surmount
the obstacles?

31:37.440 --> 31:40.307
In effect, it could not.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.859
Why do I not believe you?

31:51.960 --> 31:53.939
What has he done?

31:56.720 --> 31:59.780
Are you most troubled by
the thing itself or something more?

31:59.960 --> 32:01.939
It's the thing itself.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.025
No, 'tis more. 'Tis...

32:05.200 --> 32:07.065
It's the running away from it.

32:07.240 --> 32:12.906
Hiding from what has passed and the refusal to
look it in the face and stand the consequence.

32:13.080 --> 32:17.301
But...isn't that what you are doing?
Even now?

32:25.880 --> 32:29.987
- What would you have me do?
- Oh, Demelza. I cannot instruct you.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.139
I do not even know the deed.

32:33.320 --> 32:35.629
But reason cannot guide you.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.462
Only the heart.

32:38.640 --> 32:43.179
And sometimes what the heart dictates
makes no sense at all.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.384
Yet it must be followed.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.223
- Did 'ee miss I?
- Miss 'ee? You black worm.

33:16.400 --> 33:20.939
Leaving I alone to fend off villains and footpads.
Fat lot of use you are!

33:21.120 --> 33:23.384
You lizardy louse!

33:23.560 --> 33:24.629
Where be the maid?

33:24.800 --> 33:27.542
- Left us at Bargus Crossroad.
- Bound for where?

33:27.720 --> 33:29.699
Nowhere that'll do her any good.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.139
(Chatter)

34:00.040 --> 34:02.224
Excuse me. Ross!

34:03.560 --> 34:04.822
(Laughter)

34:05.000 --> 34:08.060
- Are you a figment of my imagination?
- I hope not.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.901
I'm here to see my colonel.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.945
- Thought I'd look you up.
- I'm astonished.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.588
Well, I'm ravenous. When do we dine?

34:47.320 --> 34:49.140
Is Demelza well?

34:49.320 --> 34:51.902
She didn't say. I've been in London.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.298
What on earth took you there?

34:54.480 --> 34:56.823
Caroline.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.865
I went to thank her for the loan.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.304
And to congratulate her on her engagement.

35:01.480 --> 35:05.029
Which I wasn't able to do
since it turns out there's no such event.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.339
Er...I don't understand.

35:07.520 --> 35:12.423
I_also made mention of her uncle's ill health
which may account for her deCI5|on to VlSlt him.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.580
- Whether there's another purpose...
- What? So, Caroline's...

35:15.760 --> 35:17.307
Where is she?

35:17.480 --> 35:19.698
Standing just behind you.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.024
Does Ross know you're here?

35:57.040 --> 35:58.940
Is Ross my keeper?

36:00.320 --> 36:02.299
Why have you come?

36:05.080 --> 36:07.344
I thought 'twas to tell you that I hate you.

36:08.360 --> 36:11.864
You've marred my faith.
You've broke my marriage.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.019
That I enw you.

36:15.560 --> 36:19.223
The passion which you rouse
that Ross could not withstand.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.947
That I pity you.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.099
Cos you could never make up your mind.

36:27.560 --> 36:31.064
Now I wonder...what do any of it matter?

36:33.200 --> 36:35.065
What you did - Ross did -

36:35.240 --> 36:37.219
it cannot be undone.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.779
And you both must live with that.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.623
But I need not.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.747
What will you do?

36:52.200 --> 36:54.623
I'll take my son...

36:56.400 --> 36:58.948
..and I'll go back to my father's house.

37:00.400 --> 37:03.779
- You would leave Ross?
- I will no longer be ruled by what he did.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.059
You're welcome to him.

37:24.680 --> 37:28.582
Believe me, I do not lightly meddle
in other people's affairs.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.945
That's been Demelza's way.

37:32.120 --> 37:34.338
And often I've chided her for it.

37:35.680 --> 37:38.422
But lately,
I've come around to her way ofthinking.

37:38.600 --> 37:42.058
She would say
that iftwo people love each other...

37:42.240 --> 37:46.540
then the obstacles which keep them apart
must be substantial.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.984
Else they lack the courage oftheir convictions.

37:51.160 --> 37:56.029
I think she would also say life holds very few
things which are genuinely worth having.

37:58.240 --> 38:02.461
And if you possess them then...
nothing else matters.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.459
And if you don't possess them then...

38:08.480 --> 38:10.459
..everything else is worthless.

38:12.920 --> 38:15.024
And yet, to gamble on the unknown...

38:16.760 --> 38:21.345
Is not all life a gamble? And does the gambler
always come ofﬁNorst?

38:23.040 --> 38:27.784
I suspect that those who suffer most
are the ones that ignore their heart's desires...

38:27.960 --> 38:30.827
and spend the rest oftheir lives regretting it.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.706
Now, no doubt, you hate me.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.948
And now, no doubt, I hate you.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.702
(Gunshot)

39:19.880 --> 39:21.859
Aargh!

39:43.680 --> 39:46.706
Did you fire that gun?
Judas! You might have killed me.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.701
What do you mean by firing
without checking there's folk about?

39:49.880 --> 39:53.828
Orders, Missus. Shoot all folk who's straying.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.946
Now be off before I fire again.

40:08.960 --> 40:13.067
Captain Ross Poldark
of his Majesty's 62nd Regiment of Foot.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.702
Fences, my ivers. Never needed 'em in my day.

40:41.880 --> 40:45.020
- World's gone to pot. 'Tis a crying disgrace.
- 'Tis.

40:46.200 --> 40:49.749
- What happened?
- 'Tis just a scratch. 'Tis all.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.309
- That luggard Tom Harry.
- He never shot at thee?

40:52.480 --> 40:55.222
- On the path by Trenwith.
- On Warleggan's orders.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.868
- I'll give him orders.
- Nay, Jud.

40:58.040 --> 41:00.383
I want no more feuding between our families.

41:00.560 --> 41:03.222
Tell no-one ofthis. Least of all Ross.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.265
- Let me bind it for thee, maid.
- I can manage.

41:08.440 --> 41:10.021
Say nothing.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.869
Have you really captured me, Doctor Enys?

41:30.640 --> 41:34.098
- You understand this changes nothing.
- It changes everything.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.738
Caroline, I'm going to war.

41:37.920 --> 41:41.219
It'd be foolish to pretend there's no risk.
Ifthe worst should happen...

41:41.400 --> 41:43.345
Why would you speak of such things?

41:43.520 --> 41:45.385
Because I must.

41:45.560 --> 41:48.905
Because you are enlisting in an adventure
every bit as fraught as my own

41:49.080 --> 41:51.947
and you must know
what you are putting your name to.

41:53.120 --> 41:57.307
I am putting my name aside
and taking that ofthe man that I love.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.259
How long do we have?

42:05.280 --> 42:07.259
I sail on the morning tide.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.384
So these are our last few hours.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.379
They are.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.699
Where is your room?

42:44.520 --> 42:47.466
JUD: He closed off our land.
- (Shouts of agreement)

42:47.640 --> 42:49.858
- He gave her a twagging.
- An' old Prudie.

42:50.040 --> 42:52.941
- He tried to murder I.
- Have Cap'n Ross hang.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.862
And now he's gone and shot the mistress.

42:56.040 --> 42:57.189
(Angry shouts)

42:57.360 --> 43:01.228
We should set a ring around Trenwith
and burn it to the ground!

43:01.400 --> 43:02.788
(Cries of agreement)

43:02.960 --> 43:05.099
- Who's with me?
- (Cries of agreement)

43:10.720 --> 43:13.541
- Why didn't you stop him?
- Stop him? Why?

43:13.720 --> 43:15.187
'Twas I that told him to go.

43:15.360 --> 43:19.262
George Warleggan do think
he can throw his weight around

43:19.440 --> 43:21.829
and tramp common folk beneath his boot.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.549
But fire at thee? 'Tis too much.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.859
Prudie, what have you done?

43:34.280 --> 43:36.669
(Chanting and shouting)

43:52.520 --> 43:54.738
I think in January we'll settle in town.

43:54.920 --> 43:59.107
Trenwith is so out ofthe way and I must be
on hand to keep an eye on the new building.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.464
- The Warleggan bank?
- Hm.

44:02.760 --> 44:06.309
We start demolishing
those unsightly hovels next month.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.140
Of course, my prime concern is for you.

44:09.320 --> 44:11.299
(Door opens)

44:18.760 --> 44:21.342
- What do you want?
- To tell you to bar your doors.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.307
There's unrest in the village.
They may march on Trenwith.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.985
You expect me to believe this?

44:28.160 --> 44:30.867
(Sighs) I have no love of you, George.
Nor you, Elizabeth.

44:31.040 --> 44:34.305
But for the sake of Geoffrey Charles
and Agatha, I urge you.

44:34.480 --> 44:37.586
A mob would be ill-advised to trespass here.
They would be breaking the law

44:37.760 --> 44:41.503
- and I would see to it that they hang.
- Ifthey didn't string you up first!

44:41.680 --> 44:43.545
- Is that a threat?
- It's a plea.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.426
For him to come to his senses.

44:45.600 --> 44:49.787
- Did Ross send you?
- How could he? He'll be on his way to France.

44:51.920 --> 44:55.139
My informers tell me
he has rejoined his regiment.

44:55.320 --> 44:57.948
Oh, surely he hasn't snuck away
without telling you?

44:59.920 --> 45:06.428
But perhaps having tasted defeat at home,
he's gone to vent his rage on a different enemy.

45:06.600 --> 45:09.262
- Defeat?
- As you see.

45:10.840 --> 45:13.707
His foe is in possession ofthe field.

45:15.200 --> 45:18.465
Of his ancestral home, ofthe woman he loved.

45:20.240 --> 45:26.941
And in March, the rout will be complete
when Elizabeth gives birth to a Warleggan heir.

45:30.080 --> 45:32.708
I look forward to Ross's congratulations.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.347
If he ever returns.

45:37.680 --> 45:40.547
But don't let me keep you from your scullery.

45:42.120 --> 45:44.509
Perhaps you should
barricade yourself in yours.

45:44.680 --> 45:48.628
- To what purpose?
- To save yourselffrom being lynched.

45:52.360 --> 45:54.544
(Angry shouting in distance)

46:03.760 --> 46:06.422
Tankard. Harry! Triggs, Kemp!

46:17.560 --> 46:18.663
(Jud cries out)

46:18.840 --> 46:20.819
(Chanting and shouting)

46:26.480 --> 46:29.779
Paul! Jud! Don't do this. Not for me.

46:29.960 --> 46:33.509
I beg 'ee! Lead them home.
There's women and children inside.

46:33.680 --> 46:36.342
IfWarleggan have no care for ours,
why should we care for his?

46:36.520 --> 46:40.183
Don't do this. Save yourselves.
They have weapons.

46:40.360 --> 46:43.909
- So do we!
- And it's time to see him taste his own medicine!

47:02.880 --> 47:05.667
Be advised. We have firearms
and won't hesitate to use them.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.501
Come on, then. Come on!

47:10.480 --> 47:13.028
I would dearly love to send you to the devil.

47:13.200 --> 47:16.579
As 'ee tried to do once before.
An' see how well that worked.

47:16.760 --> 47:18.864
They'll be no second coming for you this time.

47:19.040 --> 47:20.348
Take aim.

47:20.520 --> 47:23.023
No! Stop!

47:23.200 --> 47:25.862
These people are your neighbours.
Why do you treat them so?

47:26.040 --> 47:28.622
They are threatening my family
and must take the consequences.

47:28.800 --> 47:31.109
- Stop this!
- (Gunshot)

47:31.280 --> 47:33.259
(Silence descends)

48:08.760 --> 48:11.740
Lost our nerve, have we?
Didn't fancy the battlefields of France?

48:12.800 --> 48:15.303
My servant informed me
of one closer to home.

48:15.480 --> 48:17.983
And on which side will you ﬁght, Ross?

48:18.160 --> 48:21.220
For the civilised world? Or the revolution?

48:21.400 --> 48:24.221
On the side that stands for humanity.

48:25.560 --> 48:27.425
Which would seem to preclude yours.

48:27.600 --> 48:30.899
So what do you intend? To incite a riot?
Quite your speciality.

48:32.200 --> 48:34.179
These people need no inciting.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.389
They would happily tear you limb from limb.

48:38.560 --> 48:41.222
- (Cries of agreement)
- And with good cause.

48:45.440 --> 48:48.466
- But they would pay for it.
- What care us?

48:48.640 --> 48:50.301
It would be worth every penny.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.983
I urge you to go home.

48:54.280 --> 48:58.546
Do not give this man reason to see you hang.

48:58.720 --> 49:00.824
You have families.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.707
Wives. Children.

49:03.880 --> 49:08.624
They are worth ten
ofthis sorry excuse for a man.

49:12.440 --> 49:14.624
Now, go home.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.699
Go home.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.589
Should you notjoin your comrades?

49:37.000 --> 49:38.979
Have a care, George.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.428
Do you really want to provoke me?

49:43.600 --> 49:47.866
You know I could call them back in an instant.
At any time.

49:49.760 --> 49:52.820
(Scoffs) And this is what you came back for?

49:53.960 --> 49:55.507
No.

50:55.840 --> 50:57.819
Caroline?

50:58.000 --> 51:03.825
Oh, my dear. It's so nice to see you...here.
I'm...I'm all amazement.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.581
I've come back to care for you, Uncle.

51:05.760 --> 51:08.740
- Aww. _
- Now tell me what Doctor Enys prescribes.

51:08.920 --> 51:12.469
Here is his list of instructions.

51:13.480 --> 51:16.586
I'm beginning to think
I misjudged that young man.

51:16.760 --> 51:20.901
You, of course, don't waste
a moment's thought on him, do you, eh?

51:22.560 --> 51:24.539
Not a single one, Uncle.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.579
(Thunder rumbles)

51:39.400 --> 51:42.267
I trust you know we were never
in any actual danger.

51:44.080 --> 51:49.985
Ross thought to scare us but, in the end,
he was forced to back down.

51:59.920 --> 52:02.582
I've been thinking of Harrow.

52:02.760 --> 52:04.580
For Geoffrey Charles.

52:04.760 --> 52:07.627
He's still overly attached to his Mama.
We must toughen him up.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.507
You mean send him away?

52:10.680 --> 52:13.308
To one ofthe best schools in the country.

52:16.120 --> 52:19.226
But he's so young. And he will miss it here.

52:19.400 --> 52:22.107
- And I...
- Will have our child to attend to.

52:23.120 --> 52:26.624
Geoffrey Charles has had you all to himself.

52:26.800 --> 52:29.018
And now he must learn to be a man.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.749
(Thunder rumbles, wind whistles)

52:53.840 --> 52:56.866
(Sighs) So she's with child.

52:59.280 --> 53:01.623
George must be exultant.

53:04.280 --> 53:07.022
To be in my family's home
and in full possession of...

53:07.200 --> 53:09.179
Everything you hold dear.

53:10.680 --> 53:13.660
Not everything. But many things I hold dear.

53:18.440 --> 53:19.941
You'll get over it.

53:23.400 --> 53:25.379
Demelza?

53:50.200 --> 53:51.747
What are you doing?

53:55.440 --> 53:59.979
I'm taking Jeremy... to my father's house.

54:00.160 --> 54:02.867
From there, who knows?

54:03.960 --> 54:05.939
You're leaving me?

54:07.440 --> 54:11.547
I came back for you. I chose not to go to war.

54:11.720 --> 54:14.666
(Scoffs) 'Tis not my concern what you choose.

54:15.680 --> 54:16.942
Only what I choose.

54:17.120 --> 54:19.623
Why would I choose a man
whose heart belonged to another?

54:19.800 --> 54:23.304
- You are my wife.
- Raised from the gutter to be a great lady.

54:24.320 --> 54:25.981
I'll never be such a one.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.865
But what do I care?

54:30.040 --> 54:33.669
For I am fierce and proud
and steadfast and true.

54:33.840 --> 54:36.422
And I'll not settle for second best.

54:37.480 --> 54:39.186
Why would you be?

54:39.360 --> 54:43.706
Because you love Elizabeth.
Because you will always love Elizabeth.

54:43.880 --> 54:49.182
Because you cannot conceal your pain
that George now possesses her body and soul.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.339
Do you deny it?

54:54.760 --> 54:56.819
I do not deny that I loved her.

54:58.280 --> 55:01.306
Long before I set eyes on you,
she was my first...

55:04.640 --> 55:06.505
..perfect...

55:06.680 --> 55:09.228
..untouchable love.

55:09.400 --> 55:11.868
Whereas I am dull, imperfect and ordinary.

55:12.040 --> 55:14.383
Not ordinary. But, yes, imperfect.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.344
Human.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.661
Real.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.947
And what that night with Elizabeth taught me...

55:29.120 --> 55:32.385
and God knows, there should have been
other ways for me to come to my senses,

55:32.560 --> 55:34.619
but my arrogance...

55:34.800 --> 55:37.746
my idiocy...

55:39.040 --> 55:42.669
..has been spectacular.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.580
All I can say is...

55:44.760 --> 55:46.660
after that night...

55:46.840 --> 55:48.819
because of it...

55:50.040 --> 55:53.419
I came to see that if you take an idealised love...

55:54.440 --> 55:57.546
..and bring it down to the level
of an imperfect one...

55:57.720 --> 56:01.781
..it isn't the imperfect one which suffers.

56:04.600 --> 56:07.945
My true, real...

56:09.440 --> 56:11.658
..and abiding love is not for her.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.664
'Tis for you.

56:17.840 --> 56:20.308
She will never come between us again.

56:33.560 --> 56:35.539
What did you expect?

56:36.560 --> 56:38.539
When you made a pact with the devil?

56:39.560 --> 56:42.859
- (Thunderclap)
- I hoped, still hope...

56:44.080 --> 56:48.744
..that George may be more accommodating,
once his child is born.

56:48.920 --> 56:51.343
He may.

56:51.520 --> 56:54.068
But are you willing to wait that long?

56:55.320 --> 56:57.220
March is not so far away.

56:58.640 --> 57:00.505
unless it comes sooner.

57:00.680 --> 57:02.545
What?

57:02.720 --> 57:04.347
The child.

57:04.520 --> 57:05.987
Why should it?

57:13.760 --> 57:15.739
(Thunder rumbles)
