00:01.360 --> 00:04.090
Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...
Mona, we need your help.

00:04.130 --> 00:06.064
EMILY: We just found out that
Ali's at the police station.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.237
She's talking to the cops.

00:07.270 --> 00:08.589
But I'm already number one
on her hit list.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.767
If Alison finds out
I'm siding with you guys,

00:10.810 --> 00:13.108
I'm afraid to think of how far
she'd go to stop me.

00:13.140 --> 00:14.471
We never had our talk.

00:14.510 --> 00:15.499
I'm tired of talking.

00:17.110 --> 00:18.600
Happy graduation.

00:18.650 --> 00:19.674
Spence.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.709
SPENCER: I love you.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.379
BETHANY: Iwonder
if I can trust anyone

00:23.420 --> 00:24.387
in that family.

00:24.420 --> 00:25.580
Did Alison know Bethany?

00:25.620 --> 00:26.689
Where are you?

00:26.720 --> 00:28.119
Wait, I can't hear you.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.185
( horn honking )
( tires screeching )

00:30.230 --> 00:31.629
Spencer Hastings,
you're under arrest

00:31.660 --> 00:33.525
for the murder of
Bethany Young.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.118
I-I-I didn't do this.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.491
Where are we going?
To Mona's.

00:36.530 --> 00:38.225
She found proof.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.397
Oh, my God.
Mona!

00:40.440 --> 00:42.101
HOLBROOK: Although
we did not find a body,

00:42.140 --> 00:44.438
we have ruled
this a homicide.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.501
* Just hear those
sleigh bells jingling *

00:47.540 --> 00:50.270
* Ring-ting-tingling, too

00:50.310 --> 00:52.175
* Come on,
it's lovely weather *

00:52.220 --> 00:54.814
* For a sleigh ride
together with you *

00:54.850 --> 00:56.818
* Outside the snow is falling

00:56.850 --> 00:59.182
* And friends are calling,
"Yoo hoo" *

00:59.220 --> 01:00.756
So what did you
get for Toby?

01:00.790 --> 01:03.520
I'm abstaining from
Christmas this year, remember?

01:03.560 --> 01:04.857
When you're out on bail
for murder,

01:04.890 --> 01:07.154
it just feels like
the right thing to do.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.327
And he's okay with that?

01:09.370 --> 01:11.622
Well, he agreed
to not giving presents

01:11.670 --> 01:15.390
ifI agreed to surprising
each other with a gesture.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.702
Like the clowns?

01:16.740 --> 01:17.866
What clowns?

01:17.910 --> 01:20.470
Court jesters.
They're clowns, right?

01:23.680 --> 01:25.773
I've always
loved these windows.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.888
Let's make a wish.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.115
Yeah, let's make a wish
for Spencer.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.856
Guys, Santa is not bringing me
a stay-out-of-jail-free card.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.121
Han, want a snowflake?

01:42.670 --> 01:44.626
The last time I was here,
it was with Mona.

01:47.170 --> 01:49.400
What'd you wish for?

01:49.440 --> 01:51.203
You're my first
friend, Hanna.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.731
I wished for us
to always stay close.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.872
We will.

01:54.910 --> 01:56.605
Besties forever.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.106
I promise.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.475
So what'd you wish for?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.317
Jimmy Choos.

02:03.350 --> 02:04.612
Oh, you're getting those.

02:04.650 --> 02:06.356
Iam?

02:06.390 --> 02:08.551
If Santa doesn't bring 'em,
we'll steal 'em.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.353
Wishes don't come true,
Emily.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.265
If they did,
people wouldn't die.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.465
I'm still
holding out hope.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.900
Hope is a dirty
four-letter word.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.862
We live in an "A" world.

02:24.910 --> 02:26.901
They still haven't found
Mona's body.

02:26.940 --> 02:28.271
Yeah, that's because

02:28.310 --> 02:30.540
"A" likes to bury
the bodies herself.

02:30.580 --> 02:33.310
Yeah, and then
throw Ice Balls.

02:33.350 --> 02:34.942
I swear Alison is
throwing this party

02:34.980 --> 02:36.641
to rub it in our faces.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.181
I ruined your lives and now
I'm the belle of the ball.

02:39.220 --> 02:40.812
Technically,
she only ruined my life.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.420
Ruin one of us,
ruin all of us.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.826
Yeah, I'd rather dance
on dead monkeys

02:45.860 --> 02:47.498
than go to Ali's
stupid Ice Ball.

02:47.530 --> 02:49.828
Dead monkeys?

02:49.870 --> 02:52.737
Ali got everything
she wanted.

02:52.770 --> 02:55.330
Mona's gone,
Bethany's dead,

02:55.370 --> 02:57.509
and now she's making
Spencer go down for it.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.671
Is that a reporter
or a cop?

03:00.710 --> 03:01.870
Neither.

03:01.910 --> 03:02.945
That pen's too nice.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.845
My money's on a lawyer.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.677
Hanna Marin?

03:06.720 --> 03:08.176
Yes.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.285
Told you.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.413
Mona Vanderwaal retained me
to handle her affairs

03:14.460 --> 03:15.711
in the event
of her demise.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.354
I was instructed to wait
30 days after her death,

03:18.390 --> 03:19.857
then deliver this to you
personally.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.558
Merry Christmas.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.898
Bah humbug.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.466
I'm afraid to open it.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.648
These are drawings
of Ali's house.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.409
Yeah, and all of her
hiding places.

03:41.450 --> 03:44.010
It's from Mona.

03:44.050 --> 03:46.553
"Hey, Han.
If you're reading this..."

03:46.590 --> 03:48.410
MONA: She's still
playing the game

03:48.460 --> 03:50.678
and I'm talking to you
from the grave.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.494
But I went out fighting
and that's what you need to do.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.725
Promise me
you won't gIve up, Hanna.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.728
You have to keep looking.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.761
Kisses, M.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.405
I promised Mona
we'd always stick together.

04:05.970 --> 04:08.438
Well, you have to figure,
"A" keeps souvenirs, right?

04:08.480 --> 04:09.879
You mean Alison.

04:09.910 --> 04:12.310
Different name,
same bitch.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.375
There has to be something
in Ali's house that proves

04:14.420 --> 04:16.479
she killed Bethany.

04:16.520 --> 04:17.589
And Spencer didn't.

04:17.620 --> 04:18.985
I think Mona
just handed us a way

04:19.020 --> 04:20.510
to give you a Christmas,
Spence.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.778
And your
stay-out-of-jail-free card.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.390
( bell ringing )

04:28.000 --> 04:29.592
Hey, Santa.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.804
Thank you.

04:42.380 --> 04:43.779
Oh, my God.

04:43.810 --> 04:45.869
EMILY: Is that us?

04:48.420 --> 04:49.489
"'A' takes a holiday.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.010
You should, too."

05:05.500 --> 05:08.037
( banging )

05:08.070 --> 05:09.958
( panting )

05:17.110 --> 05:18.600
Mom.

05:18.650 --> 05:21.448
She's got a lot
to show you.

05:21.480 --> 05:22.981
Pay attention.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.551
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

05:33.600 --> 05:36.091
* Swear this one you'll save

05:36.130 --> 05:38.690
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

05:38.730 --> 05:41.369
* Taking this one
to the grave *

05:41.400 --> 05:43.539
* IfI show you, then I know

05:43.570 --> 05:46.403
* You won't tell what I said

05:46.440 --> 05:48.738
* 'Cause two can keep
a secret *

05:48.780 --> 05:51.101
* If one of them is dead

06:24.780 --> 06:29.513
( piano music playing )

06:55.940 --> 06:57.601
I know you'd told me
never to leave the house

06:57.650 --> 06:59.811
without my face on,
but as a corpse,

06:59.850 --> 07:03.684
this is the best I can do
for your Ice Ball.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.449
This isn't real.

07:09.090 --> 07:10.887
You were quite
the little pianist.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.197
Is that me?

07:14.230 --> 07:15.697
You don't remember?

07:18.030 --> 07:20.191
It's not pretty.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.935
But you need to see it.

07:21.970 --> 07:24.029
See what?

07:24.070 --> 07:26.004
Wait for it.

07:29.110 --> 07:30.805
( hitting dead key)

08:05.750 --> 08:07.479
Alison!

08:08.680 --> 08:10.113
I didn't mean to,

08:10.150 --> 08:11.742
but I found your
hiding place.

08:11.790 --> 08:15.248
Did you and Daddy give me
the same present?

08:15.290 --> 08:17.588
I don't know
what you mean.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.258
Daddy will think
it's funny when I tell him.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.121
There are not two dresses.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.899
I think you need glasses.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.631
You only saw one dress.

08:29.670 --> 08:33.003
You found the present,
one present.

08:33.040 --> 08:37.204
You opened it
and there was one dress.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.071
Why, Mommy?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.610
Because I don't want
Daddy to leave us.

08:41.650 --> 08:44.187
And he will, if you tell him
about the dresses.

08:48.790 --> 08:50.781
I'll say whatever
you want me to.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.286
Good girl.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.797
Now tell me what happened.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.650
The real story.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.964
I was playing the piano.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.037
I looked inside of it
and found one present,

09:01.070 --> 09:02.958
one yellow dress.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.160
Good girl.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.030
One more time.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.604
I was playing the piano.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.642
I looked inside of it
and found one present,

09:10.680 --> 09:12.614
one yellow dress.

09:12.650 --> 09:15.175
And the monster was born.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.279
Who was
the other dress for?

09:19.150 --> 09:20.686
Was it Bethany?

09:23.090 --> 09:25.581
It's not going to be
that easy, bitch.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.249
( glass shatters )

09:36.640 --> 09:38.733
SPENCER: Ali made
hiding things into a game.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.940
TOBY: You're out on bail
for a murder charge, Spencer.

09:45.810 --> 09:47.812
SPENCER: Well,
it's not a perfect plan,

09:47.850 --> 09:48.919
but it's all I've got.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.958
And I saw the look
on my mom's face

09:54.990 --> 09:57.322
after we met my lawyers
for the last time.

09:59.190 --> 10:00.157
We've already lost.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.952
It's not over yet.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.321
But, hey, what if Ali
leaves the dance early?

10:04.370 --> 10:06.224
She won't.

10:06.270 --> 10:08.363
Aria and Emily
are gonna find a reason

10:08.400 --> 10:10.061
to keep her there.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.305
And you will be here to warn us
if anything goes wrong.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.368
I thought everybody was
splitting up on Christmas.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.378
No, we're all gonna
catch up with our parents

10:21.420 --> 10:23.411
before the snow starts.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.884
Mm, sounds like
you've got it all figured out.

10:27.290 --> 10:31.249
Toby, this might be
my last Christmas.

10:31.290 --> 10:32.928
Spencer...

10:37.000 --> 10:38.024
So...

10:51.250 --> 10:52.979
Merry-ho-ho.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.170
Nice gesture.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.812
Thanks.

10:59.350 --> 11:01.011
( indistinct chatter )

11:01.060 --> 11:02.857
* The lights are bright

11:02.890 --> 11:03.982
* It's cold tonight

11:04.030 --> 11:04.780
MAN 1: Merry Christmas.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.696
MAN 2: Merry
Christmas to you, too.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.189
Merry Christmas.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.791
Okay, where's my friend
Claire?

11:19.840 --> 11:21.398
I haven't signed
since fat camp.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.249
My bunkmate was
hard of hearing.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.679
Merry Christmas.

11:28.780 --> 11:31.112
What's wrong?

11:31.150 --> 11:33.186
I'm pretty sure that
some kid peed on me,

11:33.220 --> 11:34.187
and that mean little girl,

11:34.220 --> 11:35.448
she keeps calling me
dumb-dumb.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.026
What mean girl?

11:37.060 --> 11:38.379
Ali's little mini-me.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.455
Right there,
there she is.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.798
Call her anything
you want.

11:43.830 --> 11:45.195
She can't hear you.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.905
Get over here.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.407
All of you.

11:58.210 --> 11:59.507
I'm only gonna say this once.

11:59.550 --> 12:02.178
You mess with Claire,
you deal with me.

12:02.220 --> 12:03.949
I'm shaking with fear.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.956
You better start looking
over your shoulder,

12:07.990 --> 12:09.855
because you're making
a lot of enemies.

12:09.890 --> 12:12.723
And in Rosewood,
bitches get buried.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.991
This place blows.
Let's get out of here.

12:18.830 --> 12:22.231
Hey, you guys,
you don't need a leader.

12:22.270 --> 12:23.806
You just need each other.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.331
I said let's go!

12:33.180 --> 12:34.818
Losers.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.017
Well, I would say that

12:40.060 --> 12:42.085
you put the fear
of Hanna in her.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.884
Well, Mona used to say
when someone shows you

12:44.930 --> 12:46.420
who they are,
believe them.

12:47.530 --> 12:49.794
I don't think
people change, Caleb.

12:49.830 --> 12:52.025
They just get better
at hiding it.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.428
But mean girls
stay mean.

13:06.350 --> 13:10.138
* O come, let us adore him

13:10.190 --> 13:14.012
* O come,
let us adore him *

13:14.060 --> 13:18.383
* O come, let us adore him

13:18.430 --> 13:21.251
* Christ the Lord

13:21.300 --> 13:22.892
Cookie?

13:22.930 --> 13:24.466
( applause )

13:29.240 --> 13:31.105
I know you wanted to keep it
low-key this holiday,

13:31.140 --> 13:33.574
but this is for tonight.

13:33.610 --> 13:36.078
Is it an Ali-decoder ring?

13:36.110 --> 13:37.441
( chuckles )

13:41.120 --> 13:42.917
Ezra, they're beautiful.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.019
Thank you.

13:44.050 --> 13:46.189
And Mandi at the boutique

13:46.220 --> 13:49.314
said it might go well
with this.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.626
All right, if this is low-key,

13:52.660 --> 13:55.197
I'm afraid to ask
what full-on Christmas

13:55.230 --> 13:56.322
looks like
at the Fitzgerald house.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.861
Oh, yeah, don't ask.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.164
It's like how many ponies
can you get?

14:00.200 --> 14:01.599
Seriously?

14:01.640 --> 14:03.198
No.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.161
Ezra?

14:05.910 --> 14:08.299
Well, I got two ponies,
but I only asked for one.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.369
Merry Christmas.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.547
You got a minute?

14:14.580 --> 14:16.070
What do you want?

14:16.120 --> 14:19.248
So it looks like you and Paige
worked things out.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.156
Why doesn't Jenna
come over here and talk to me?

14:23.190 --> 14:25.158
And you don't have to be
her eyes and ears.

14:25.190 --> 14:27.124
She can still hear, right?

14:27.160 --> 14:28.491
Jenna's not a bad person.

14:28.530 --> 14:30.020
You just wouldn't
know that because

14:30.070 --> 14:31.628
Alison convinced you
that she was the enemy.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.297
Is that all?

14:33.340 --> 14:36.468
All right, I just wanted
to say Merry Christmas.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.105
Yeah.

14:39.140 --> 14:40.437
PAIGE: It's not
what I want.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.300
It's what you want.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.674
What's wrong?

14:45.710 --> 14:47.268
Nothing.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.448
My parents want me
to come to California
after Christmas.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.152
Well, that sounds
like a fun winter break.

14:54.290 --> 14:55.450
Look up.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.568
Well, let's see
how you look.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.302
Wow.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.308
It's a Christmas miracle.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.628
( sighs )

15:39.670 --> 15:42.298
I still don't see
All anywhere.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.308
She's probably waiting
to make her grand entrance.

15:44.340 --> 15:46.228
Timed to the perfect song.

15:46.270 --> 15:48.374
Well, we can't leave
until she gets here, so...

15:50.050 --> 15:52.041
I'm going to go have my picture
taken with Santa Claus.

16:04.490 --> 16:06.458
I think you know what
I want for Christmas.

16:06.490 --> 16:09.596
And I think you know
I'll do whatever I can
to help you get it.

16:12.530 --> 16:14.066
Hanna and I
are headed to her house

16:14.100 --> 16:15.465
the second All gets here.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.139
We'll make sure
she stays here, Spencer.

16:18.170 --> 16:20.206
You've been a very good girl
this year.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.071
Santa won't let you down.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.748
( laughter )

16:23.780 --> 16:26.169
Lucas”.

16:26.210 --> 16:28.678
Paige said that
All was building her own army.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.709
Be careful tonight.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.547
We can't trust anyone.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.559
* Like how a single word

16:34.590 --> 16:37.627
* Can make a heart open

16:37.660 --> 16:39.548
* I might only have
one match *

16:39.590 --> 16:43.219
* But I can make an explosion

16:43.270 --> 16:46.068
* And all those things
I didn't say *

16:46.100 --> 16:48.762
* Wrecking balls
inside my brain *

16:48.800 --> 16:51.337
* I will scream them
loud tonight *

16:51.370 --> 16:54.100
* Can you hear my voice
this time? *

16:54.140 --> 16:56.677
* This is my fight song

16:56.710 --> 16:58.575
* Take back my life song

16:58.610 --> 16:59.577
* Prove I'm all right song

16:59.610 --> 17:01.339
MAN: Whoa, check it out!

17:02.680 --> 17:03.681
Whoa-ho!

17:03.720 --> 17:05.642
Who are those other girls?

17:05.690 --> 17:07.248
* My powers turned on

17:07.290 --> 17:08.484
* Starting right now

17:08.520 --> 17:10.385
* I'll be strong

17:10.430 --> 17:13.058
* I'll play my fight song

17:13.100 --> 17:15.352
* And I don't really care

17:15.400 --> 17:19.291
* If nobody else believes

17:19.330 --> 17:22.788
* 'Cause I've still got
a lot of fight left in me *

17:22.840 --> 17:25.434
* This is my fight song

17:25.470 --> 17:27.074
Let's get out of here

17:27.110 --> 17:29.305
while everyone's still
basking in the glow of Ali.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.449
Hanna.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.175
Be careful.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.209
* My powers turned on

17:37.250 --> 17:38.342
* Starting right now

17:38.390 --> 17:40.415
* I'll be strong

17:40.460 --> 17:43.679
* I'll play my fight song

17:43.730 --> 17:45.357
* And I don't really care

17:45.390 --> 17:48.325
* If nobody else believes

17:57.370 --> 18:02.307
( music playing )

18:06.350 --> 18:09.319
* When we're together

18:09.350 --> 18:12.740
* We are the angels
in the snow *

18:16.290 --> 18:18.451
* Holiday...

18:18.490 --> 18:19.855
ARIA: Who is that?

18:25.630 --> 18:26.767
Hey.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.869
Aren't you supposed
to be on "A" watch?

18:27.900 --> 18:29.458
Yeah.
You need to see this.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.501
What is it?

18:30.540 --> 18:32.758
I just saw Ali
kissing Santa Claus.

18:32.810 --> 18:34.175
Come on.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.345
( gasps )

18:45.390 --> 18:46.140
Jeez, Hanna!

18:46.190 --> 18:47.748
Do not sneak up on me
like that.

18:47.790 --> 18:48.711
I'm sorry.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.456
Okay, if we're
the only ones here,
why are we whispering?

18:53.500 --> 18:54.728
I don't know.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.227
Can we just talk
in a normal voice?

18:56.260 --> 18:58.399
Because this is
spooklng me out.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.761
Here, you take
the upstairs.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.767
I'll take the downstairs.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.598
Okay, on a creepy scale,

19:03.640 --> 19:05.665
how high would you rate
breaking into Ali's house?

19:05.710 --> 19:08.838
On a scale of 1 to 10,
it's a 20.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.172
They were just here.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.617
Was it a guy or a girl?
Guy.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.208
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.389
I definitely got a sense of
"male butt."

19:20.420 --> 19:23.253
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
take my photo with Santa Claus.

19:24.690 --> 19:27.693
Come in closer
to Santa Claus.

19:27.730 --> 19:29.721
( guffaws )

19:31.730 --> 19:33.789
Merry Christmas!

19:33.840 --> 19:35.637
( guffaws )

19:45.950 --> 19:48.248
You're on my list, Aria.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.314
The naughty one.

19:52.350 --> 19:53.556
Surprised to see you here.

19:53.590 --> 19:56.559
Yeah, not as surprised
as I am to see you.

19:56.590 --> 19:58.581
It's a charity ball.

19:58.630 --> 20:01.326
Giving back
to my community.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.828
I didn't realize that _
Rosewood was your community.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.430
The town has a lot
to offer.

20:06.470 --> 20:08.438
It's starting
to grow on me.

20:08.470 --> 20:10.529
That's spoken like a guy

20:10.570 --> 20:12.765
who maybe met a girl
that he likes.

20:12.810 --> 20:14.835
What brings you out
tonight, Aria?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.768
Same as you.

20:16.810 --> 20:18.698
It feels good
to give back.

20:18.750 --> 20:19.978
I don't know why

20:20.010 --> 20:22.274
I have such a hard time
believing you.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.585
My boyfriend's
probably looking for me.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.315
That's a pretty dress.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.851
Tell Ezra I think
he has good taste.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.796
Aria and Emily
lost Alison.

20:36.830 --> 20:39.526
Oh, well, I think
I just found her.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.587
Merry Christmas, Ali.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.495
( music playing )

22:09.420 --> 22:10.580
You don't need
to be afraid.

22:12.590 --> 22:13.591
( Emily gasps )

22:13.630 --> 22:14.949
I led you here,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.366
because I don't want Alison
to see us talking.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.835
You really get around,
Sydney.

22:24.870 --> 22:26.599
Does Jenna know
you're with Ali now?

22:29.080 --> 22:30.604
( gasps )

22:33.680 --> 22:36.945
When I first moved
to Rosewood,

22:36.980 --> 22:39.084
Alison offered to be
my friend.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.981
I made the mistake
of saying no.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.394
When she asked me
this time

22:47.430 --> 22:50.797
I gave her
the right answer.

22:50.830 --> 22:53.731
I promise you,
we're not the enemy.

22:53.770 --> 22:55.931
No, you're just
sleeping with the enemy.

22:55.970 --> 22:57.665
I'm not gay, Emily.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.109
That's not what I meant.

22:59.140 --> 23:01.131
Look, until someone puts
Ali away,

23:01.180 --> 23:04.672
we're doing
what we have to do to survive.

23:04.710 --> 23:07.611
I'm sure you and your friends
understand that.

23:12.650 --> 23:14.754
We think
she killed Mona.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.429
We do, too.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.760
Alison?

23:29.800 --> 23:31.006
There's this shop
in Le Marais

23:31.040 --> 23:33.429
that helps you make your
own fragrance.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.469
It's a tiny store,

23:34.510 --> 23:35.909
but I spent the
entire day there.

23:35.940 --> 23:37.168
The owner gets
you talking.

23:37.210 --> 23:38.370
And the next thing you know,
he's created a scent

23:38.410 --> 23:40.913
that's perfect for the person
you're telling him about.

23:42.820 --> 23:44.583
Thank you.

23:44.620 --> 23:48.511
Not just for the perfume,
but for coming to see me.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.755
When you lose someone,

23:50.790 --> 23:53.179
the first Christmas
is always the hardest.

23:55.230 --> 23:57.767
I think my mom is
still looking out for me.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.927
I'm sure she is.

23:59.970 --> 24:02.530
I had a dream about her
the other night.

24:02.570 --> 24:04.561
She came to warn me
about Mona.

24:05.810 --> 24:07.038
Mona can't hurt you
anymore.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.469
You know that.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.544
You can't
let your guard down, Ali.

24:12.580 --> 24:14.218
Your ex-frie_nds
are here tonight.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.718
And I don't think they came
to say Merry Christmas.

25:05.900 --> 25:08.095
What did you find, Hanna?

25:16.780 --> 25:18.145
REPORTER: ( on TV)
If the winds pick up,

25:18.180 --> 25:20.102
we could be looking
at blizzard conditions

25:20.150 --> 25:23.608
for the Rosewood area
on this blustery Christmas Eve.

25:23.650 --> 25:25.845
But don't worry, kids,
Santa has Rudolph

25:25.890 --> 25:27.915
to navigate his sleigh.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.024
Does the name Holly Varjak
mean anything to you?

25:35.900 --> 25:37.993
Spence?
What, Hanna?

25:38.030 --> 25:40.066
If All needs to get out of town
in a hurry,

25:40.100 --> 25:43.137
she's ready to go
as Holly Varjak.

25:47.710 --> 25:49.837
She's writing her
happy ending.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.245
To what?

25:51.280 --> 25:52.269
Breakfast at Tiffany's.

25:52.310 --> 25:54.972
Probably the movie,
not the book.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.045
Ezra always says that
she was his "Holly Golightly."

25:57.080 --> 25:58.945
And Paul Varjak was the guy
who convinced Holly

25:58.990 --> 26:00.241
that it was okay
to be loved.

26:00.290 --> 26:02.986
So in Ali's manic mind,
they got married.

26:03.020 --> 26:05.181
How do you fit
all of that information

26:05.230 --> 26:06.857
into your one head?

26:10.360 --> 26:11.463
What are those?

26:11.500 --> 26:15.334
Ali was talking to somebody
through the personal ads.

26:15.370 --> 26:18.567
Like she did with Mona
back when Mona was "A."

26:22.840 --> 26:26.071
If All was kissing Holbrook,
that would explain a lot.

26:26.110 --> 26:27.941
Yeah, like why Spencer's
about to go on trial for murder

26:27.980 --> 26:30.312
while Ali's weaving her way
through a winter wonderland.

26:30.350 --> 26:32.944
Ezra, what is it?

26:32.990 --> 26:34.981
Well, if Holbrook
is helping Ali,

26:35.020 --> 26:36.612
I want to know
when it started.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.918
Oh, my God.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.292
I promised All
I wouldn't tell

26:42.330 --> 26:45.026
because I thought
I was protecting everyone.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.163
But CeCe showed up
in New York that night.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.236
And All helped
to get her out of the country.

26:49.270 --> 26:50.965
You think Holbrook
was In on It?

26:51.010 --> 26:53.228
I think he helped
CeCe escape.

26:53.270 --> 26:55.101
And he did it for Ali.

26:55.140 --> 26:57.608
Looks like All
made a friend.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.768
PAIGE: She went
in there alone.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.139
They're heading
towards the exit.

27:03.180 --> 27:04.943
So is Holbrook.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.844
You guys follow Ali.

27:06.890 --> 27:07.857
We've got Santa.

27:07.890 --> 27:08.879
I'll grab Lucas.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.718
Detective Holbrook.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.990
May I have a word with you
for a second?

27:16.030 --> 27:17.224
Sure.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.797
( indistinct chattering )

27:49.860 --> 27:51.691
You're leaving your
own party, Ali?

27:51.730 --> 27:52.958
What's the rush?

28:00.440 --> 28:02.078
Alison?

28:12.090 --> 28:13.079
( door closing )

29:05.140 --> 29:06.232
ALISON: ( on tape )
Get out of my stuff

29:06.270 --> 29:07.237
or I'll kill you!

29:07.270 --> 29:08.874
( gasps )

29:15.880 --> 29:17.017
Where are you, Hanna?

29:17.050 --> 29:19.189
( cell phone ringing )

29:21.020 --> 29:22.351
What's wrong?

29:22.390 --> 29:23.618
CALEB: We think
Ali left the party.

29:23.660 --> 29:25.924
I tried calling Hanna
but she's not picking up.

29:27.860 --> 29:28.849
Damn it.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.492
CALEB: We're our way.

29:37.140 --> 29:38.835
Hanna, you've got to
get out of there.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.844
Where did you go?

30:29.260 --> 30:31.888
( music playing )

30:37.000 --> 30:38.865
( gasps )

30:43.970 --> 30:44.959
Mad Hatter?

30:48.010 --> 30:49.375
Mad Hatter.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.145
( cell phone buzzes )

31:58.050 --> 31:59.176
Hanna!

31:59.210 --> 32:02.509
God, I only had
one pen pal.

32:02.550 --> 32:04.188
All had a fan club.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.581
"Can't wait to see you."

32:09.620 --> 32:10.587
Oh, my God.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.157
Ali knew Bethany.

32:13.190 --> 32:15.158
And she invited her here
for Labor Day.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.229
TOBY: Damn it,
where are you?

32:54.770 --> 32:56.237
( door creaks )

33:01.510 --> 33:03.239
Spence?

33:06.380 --> 33:07.369
Spencer?

33:27.130 --> 33:28.097
Hanna?

33:29.400 --> 33:31.106
Spencer?

33:31.140 --> 33:32.402
Come on.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.199
( screaming )

33:56.600 --> 33:58.568
Come on, Hanna.
Come on.

34:05.440 --> 34:06.634
Hanna!

34:09.580 --> 34:10.535
Hanna?

34:10.580 --> 34:11.808
Hey. Hey.

34:11.850 --> 34:12.805
Come on.

34:12.850 --> 34:13.646
Hanna?

34:13.680 --> 34:16.069
Hey, please, please,
please, wake up.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.519
It's okay.

34:17.550 --> 34:18.517
( panting )

34:18.550 --> 34:19.517
Oh.

34:19.550 --> 34:20.619
Oh, my God.

34:20.650 --> 34:21.685
Are you okay?

34:21.720 --> 34:22.687
Hanna?

34:24.130 --> 34:25.188
It's okay, she's gone.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.549
She's gone.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.120
It's okay, she's gone.

34:32.230 --> 34:33.219
You're okay.

34:33.270 --> 34:35.192
Hey, you're okay.

34:44.410 --> 34:46.549
Give Mom and Grandma Bea
a big kiss for me.

34:46.580 --> 34:48.844
And I promise
I'll be on the road
as soon as It's clear.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.689
Thanks, Dad.

34:51.720 --> 34:52.709
I love you, too.

34:52.750 --> 34:54.217
This is amazing.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.751
Hanna, this letter proves
that Alison knew Bethany

34:56.790 --> 34:58.826
and lured her here
on Labor Day.

34:58.860 --> 35:00.555
This could create
enough reasonable doubt

35:00.590 --> 35:01.625
to clear Spencer.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.588
I don't want to say
the "H" word,

35:06.630 --> 35:11.636
but I am feeling cautiously
optimistic tonight.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.228
( clock chimes )

35:13.270 --> 35:14.828
( sighs )

35:14.880 --> 35:17.337
Merry Christmas.

35:17.380 --> 35:18.642
Merry Christmas.

35:18.680 --> 35:21.649
And her heart grew
three sizes that day.

35:22.780 --> 35:23.747
Merry Christmas.

35:23.780 --> 35:24.747
Merry Christmas.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.280
Merry Christmas.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.116
Merry Christmas.

35:27.150 --> 35:34.192
* Glory to the newborn king

35:34.230 --> 35:37.757
* Hark the herald angels sing

35:37.800 --> 35:41.429
* Glory to the newborn king

35:42.540 --> 35:44.167
How was the party?

35:48.480 --> 35:51.244
Ignoring me
won't make me go away.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.702
It'll just make me mad.

36:02.690 --> 36:03.714
Boo!
( gasps )

36:03.760 --> 36:05.580
( laughing )

36:08.930 --> 36:11.899
I'm scared, okay?

36:11.930 --> 36:13.727
Is that what you wanted
to hear?

36:13.770 --> 36:15.397
( sighs )

36:15.440 --> 36:16.532
It wasn't as gratifying

36:16.570 --> 36:18.162
as I thought
it was gonna be.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.903
What do you want me
to do?

36:21.940 --> 36:24.545
What do you want me to say
to make you go away?

36:27.250 --> 36:28.547
Wait for it.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.350
Tell me if Tiny Tim
will live.

36:34.390 --> 36:36.381
Do we have to watch this?

36:36.420 --> 36:37.819
It's depressing.

36:37.860 --> 36:40.351
If you think
you're depressed now,

36:40.390 --> 36:42.221
look over there.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.995
VVhen?

37:17.030 --> 37:18.588
Does it matter?

37:19.630 --> 37:21.666
It does to me.

37:21.700 --> 37:23.588
And only you.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.470
You look pretty good,
considering

37:27.510 --> 37:30.229
that they never found
your legs.

37:35.950 --> 37:38.282
Do I know you?

37:45.830 --> 37:47.479
Mom.

37:47.530 --> 37:49.851
It's all my fault.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.390
Look at me.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.023
I'm not dead.

37:54.070 --> 37:56.766
They'll be coming
for you soon.

37:58.370 --> 38:00.406
I'm sorry.

38:12.850 --> 38:15.887
( creepy whispers and moans )

38:15.920 --> 38:17.854
Am I going to hell?

38:21.030 --> 38:23.658
No. No.

38:23.700 --> 38:24.928
No!

38:24.970 --> 38:26.062
No!

38:26.100 --> 38:27.089
Please!

38:27.130 --> 38:29.337
Let me out!

38:29.370 --> 38:31.463
Mona!

38:31.510 --> 38:32.909
Mona!

38:32.940 --> 38:34.373
Wake up, bitch!

38:34.410 --> 38:36.799
It's Christmas.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.809
And I promise
you don't want to miss it.

38:46.390 --> 38:48.915
My mom called her friend
at Highway Patrol.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.418
They don't expect the roads
to be cleared until tomorrow.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.690
I'm so sorry, Em.

38:54.730 --> 38:56.550
This is the first time
I won't be with my parents

38:56.600 --> 38:58.591
on Christmas.

38:58.630 --> 39:00.393
Yeah, me too.

39:00.430 --> 39:03.467
You know, my mom always said
Christmas was wherever we were

39:03.500 --> 39:06.401
as long as
we were together.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.600
And we are...

39:07.640 --> 39:09.471
together.

39:10.540 --> 39:12.599
Seriously?

39:12.650 --> 39:14.709
Now that is a gesture.

39:14.750 --> 39:15.978
Wow.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.614
TOGETHER:
Merry Christmas.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.538
Oh, my God.

39:20.590 --> 39:28.122
* Have yourself
a merry little Christmas *

39:28.160 --> 39:33.564
* Let your heart be light

39:33.600 --> 39:36.569
* From now on

39:36.600 --> 39:42.379
* Our troubles will be
out of SIght *

39:46.710 --> 39:48.769
Hey, you okay?

39:48.820 --> 39:49.946
My parents don't think
Rosewood's

39:49.980 --> 39:52.483
a safe place anymore.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.919
They don't want me
to visit California,

39:53.950 --> 39:55.611
they want me
to move there.

39:55.660 --> 39:59.118
Wait, before graduation?

39:59.160 --> 40:01.822
I'll have enough credits
by the end of spring quarter.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.126
I just thought
we had more time.

40:09.570 --> 40:14.678
*_ Here we are
as In olden days *

40:14.710 --> 40:20.398
* Happy golden days of yore

40:21.820 --> 40:23.014
* Faithful friends
who are dear to us *

40:23.050 --> 40:25.780
Mona should be
here tonight.

40:25.820 --> 40:28.618
The only reason
we're celebrating
is because of her.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.524
Christmas chicken.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.094
ALL: Yeah!

40:44.670 --> 40:47.059
Okay, let's all
say a prayer.

40:47.110 --> 40:49.874
* Until then

40:49.910 --> 40:52.947
* We'll just have
to muddle through *

40:52.980 --> 40:55.141
* Somehow

41:00.750 --> 41:05.949
*_ Here we are
as In olden days *

41:05.990 --> 41:12.725
* Happy golden days of yore

41:12.770 --> 41:18.936
* Faithful friends
who are dear to us *

41:18.970 --> 41:25.705
* Gather near to us
once more *

41:25.750 --> 41:28.969
( tapping on glass )

41:29.020 --> 41:30.248
To this family.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.919
May we always
stay together.

41:32.950 --> 41:34.656
Cheers.

41:34.690 --> 41:35.952
ALL: Cheers.

41:40.030 --> 41:43.249
( bells jingling )

41:45.770 --> 41:46.725
Santa?

41:51.840 --> 41:55.037
* And have yourself

41:55.080 --> 41:57.776
* A merry
little Christmas now *

41:57.810 --> 41:58.947
Oh, my God.

41:58.980 --> 42:00.140
Who did this?

42:00.180 --> 42:01.818
Em?
Not me.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.921
Merry Christmas,
bitches.
