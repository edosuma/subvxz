WEBVTT

00:01.626 --> 00:04.754
BENEDICT: We suffer under something called
"The Emergency".

00:04.838 --> 00:10.260
A rapidly escalating state of panic
where the truth itself is under attack.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.804
It just feels like
something bad is about to happen.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.305
That's The Emergency.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.766
MS. PERUMAL: I've been saving
something for you. It's a test.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.769
And the winners get a scholarship
to the Boatwright Academy.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.271
You may begin.

00:21.855 --> 00:26.317
BENEDICT: There are some who possess
an unusually powerful love of the truth.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.946
Time! I shall now read the list
of those who've passed the test.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.364
Reynard Muldoon?

00:31.448 --> 00:33.158
I'm Kate Wetherall.
I'm a self-contained unit.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.160
KATE: Anything that comes up,
I deal with myself.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.287
-REYNIE: That's Sticky Washington.
-Why do they call you Sticky?

00:37.370 --> 00:39.956
STICKY:
I remember everything I read or see.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.250
-Well done.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.335
-What's in there?
-NUMBER TWO: Mr. Benedict.

00:44.419 --> 00:48.048
BENEDICT: Allow me to acquaint you
with your fourth. Constance Contraire.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.008
I apologize for nothing.

00:50.091 --> 00:53.261
We're asking you to go on a mission.
A risky, undercover mission.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.972
And, unfortunately, one that can
only be accomplished by children.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.899
You can wait here
for further instructions.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.403
-How long was I out?
-We're under attack.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.364
-Someone's cut the power.
-Cut the power?

01:14.115 --> 01:15.158
Take these.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.374
Who wants to see the safe room?

01:23.958 --> 01:26.044
-There we are.
-Is this another test?

01:26.127 --> 01:27.420
This is not a test.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.630
This way.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.510
Back, back, back!

01:37.889 --> 01:39.516
Excuse me a moment.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.643
RHONDA: Follow me, right here.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.603
-Where's Milligan?
-I don't know.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.731
-We'll go through the maze.
-STICKY: Who are those people?

01:46.815 --> 01:48.900
BENEDICT: I'll detail more later.
Stay close.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.819
We need to cross the house.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.154
The other staircase
will lead us to the safe room.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.577
This way. Hurry up! Hurry up! Eh?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.705
-Is everybody here?
-

02:02.789 --> 02:03.957
Let's go! Let's go!

02:04.040 --> 02:06.000
-

02:06.084 --> 02:08.336
Back, back, back!

02:11.881 --> 02:15.051
Stay close. Stay close. No, no, no.
This way.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.012
No, no, no. Wait.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.393
-

02:31.943 --> 02:33.278
We have to help him.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.983
MAN 1: Abort! Abort!

03:18.531 --> 03:20.950
Oh, my.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.120
Where's Constance?

03:24.746 --> 03:27.373
She ran for it right away,
to save her own skin.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.210
Maybe she was trying to flank them.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.336
-Flank them?
-

03:31.419 --> 03:32.712
Reynie, you're too nice.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.924
MILLIGAN: All clear. All clear.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.300
CONSTANCE: He is too nice.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.138
Constance? Where did you go?

03:42.847 --> 03:44.599
Where you dummies should have gone.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.311
It's called hiding. Ever heard of it?

03:48.853 --> 03:50.396
We were helping Mr. Benedict.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.982
I don't owe that guy anything.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.903
The situation's resolved.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.906
The building has been locked down
and we are perfectly safe here.

04:00.990 --> 04:01.991
Here.

04:02.617 --> 04:03.743
Who were they?

04:04.994 --> 04:08.831
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
you were not their target.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.000
-They were here for me.
-Why?

04:11.709 --> 04:13.628
Um, also, still, "Who?"

04:17.173 --> 04:18.258
Come with me.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.609
BENEDICT: Do you remember when I told you

05:18.693 --> 05:21.362
that I believe one person
is creating The Emergency?

05:21.779 --> 05:22.947
This is how.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.162
Question.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.081
Do you feel anything?

05:32.373 --> 05:35.376
Hmm... My stomach is a little upset.

05:37.045 --> 05:41.883
Interesting. That's actually a side effect
for the very sensitive.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.927
Number Two and Rhonda,
please engage the receivers.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.013
Thank you.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.515
Now, it looks normal,

05:50.516 --> 05:52.477
but listen to what's underneath.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.188
...giving us your final answer, please.

05:55.772 --> 05:59.317
MESSENGER: The missing aren't missing,
they're only departed.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.154
Poison apples, friendly visage.

06:03.821 --> 06:08.576
Pardon, possession,
a walk on the shore, poison worms...

06:09.202 --> 06:12.080
-Brush your teeth and...
-

06:12.163 --> 06:13.706
What were those?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.583
Those are the hidden messages

06:15.666 --> 06:18.461
that are being broadcast
on every TV and radio,

06:18.544 --> 06:21.422
and they're infecting our minds
without us even knowing they're there.

06:22.924 --> 06:27.261
The Emergency
is caused by subliminal messages.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.306
Manipulation sub rosa.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.976
Yes, yes. It's taken a long time
for me to put this together.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.523
The sender of these messages
is putting our psyches under siege.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.566
Why would someone do that?

06:41.067 --> 06:44.987
When people are anxious or frightened,
they're more susceptible to suggestion.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.989
They panic. They turn on each other.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.409
I mean, look... look how people
are treating each other now.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.828
Aggressive, suspicious, unkind.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.247
-It's all part of the plan.
-We are being softened up.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.707
That sounds...

06:57.333 --> 06:58.543
bad.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.669
It is.

07:00.002 --> 07:03.840
These messages are increasing in frequency
and getting stronger.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.342
Our society is fragile

07:06.426 --> 07:09.804
and so much closer to the breaking point
than we've ever been.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.224
And almost no one
is aware enough to fight it.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.143
Why are those children's voices?

07:15.643 --> 07:18.312
People aren't naturally suspicious
of children.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.607
Your voices don't trigger our defenses.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.986
Using children to send the messages
makes them virtually undetectable.

07:26.070 --> 07:29.282
Shouldn't you just,
I don't know, call the cops?

07:29.365 --> 07:31.742
-I wish it were that easy.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.286
You have a phone, right?

07:33.786 --> 07:35.872
But the government agencies
that could have helped

07:35.955 --> 07:37.373
have been dismantled.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.292
You have to understand me.

07:39.375 --> 07:43.129
Good women and men
who worked for them have gone missing.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.006
But you've got the evidence.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.091
Oh, Reynie.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.302
Proof is useless

07:49.385 --> 07:52.555
unless it's proof of something
people already want to believe.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.475
And I'm afraid
no one wants to believe this.

07:56.517 --> 08:01.814
However, I have finally discovered
where the messages are coming from.

08:05.943 --> 08:09.530
The Learning Institute
for Veritas and Enlightenment.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.658
You mean the school out on Harbor Island?

08:12.742 --> 08:13.784
Yes!

08:13.868 --> 08:18.915
That is where the sender must be,
and that is where your mission lies.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.043
What makes you think
that four kids can stop all of this?

08:22.126 --> 08:24.128
Oh, not just kids.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.381
Four extraordinary kids.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.009
And, yes, I believe you can.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.847
In fact, I believe
you're the only ones who can.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.062
It has been a long night.
Well, too long, actually.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.189
I suggest we get some sleep.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.943
Hmm. Yeah. We can go over the plan
in the morning, hmm.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.237
Number Two and Rhonda, would you please

08:49.320 --> 08:51.697
-show our friends their rooms?
-Yes. Right this way.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.368
-Please get some rest.
-RHONDA: We'll get you all set up.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.348
Maybe I wish
I never heard about any of this.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.308
But now I have heard of it.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.143
Can't go back.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.651
Are we sure any of this is even real?

09:29.652 --> 09:31.028
Doesn't it seem real?

09:31.779 --> 09:33.030
I've never been on a team.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.785
Yeah. That part is kind of cool.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.663
Team demands a name.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.625
I've workshopped a few. How about...

09:47.336 --> 09:49.422
Kate the Great

09:50.381 --> 09:53.134
and Her Triumphant Trio?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.137
CONSTANCE: That's a dumb name.

09:57.221 --> 10:01.267
It does seem less team-ish.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.603
We'll sleep on it. See how it ages.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.861
Constance, are you pretending to sleep

10:11.944 --> 10:13.404
so you don't have to talk to us?

10:43.267 --> 10:45.102
Constance, can you pass the orange juice?

10:45.519 --> 10:47.772
-No.
-No?

10:48.689 --> 10:49.857
BENEDICT: Oh.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.653
I'm so grateful you've all chosen to stay.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.112
Rhonda, the dossiers.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.489
Now, please...

10:56.572 --> 10:57.907
Please forgive the chaos.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.575
Preparations must be made.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.955
Oh, thank you.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.625
Oh, now, as I mentioned earlier,

11:07.708 --> 11:10.878
the signals are coming from the Institute
on Harbor Island.

11:10.961 --> 11:11.921
Heavily guarded.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.050
Access to it is almost exclusively limited
to incoming students.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.135
That's why it has to be children.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.596
Exactly, which is why
I could never get near the island.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.972
But you can. You can.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.057
-Sir.
-Oh, oh, that's...

11:23.140 --> 11:24.058
That's a lot. No, thank you.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.559
-NUMBER TWO: You ordered this.
-BENEDICT: No, thank you. No.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.145
You four are going to infiltrate
the Institute

11:28.229 --> 11:31.440
as new students, as my secret agents.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.236
I'm gonna need a bigger bucket.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.863
So, what do we do?

11:38.364 --> 11:40.074
Well, to begin with, deep breath.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.790
Now, your first job

11:47.873 --> 11:50.376
is to find the identity of the sender.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.795
I mean, who's running the school?

11:52.878 --> 11:55.965
I find it very odd that that information
is not even in the brochure.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.633
-Yeah.
-That's weird.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.592
Very weird.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.887
Once we know who we're dealing with,
we can get to work on our end,

12:01.971 --> 12:06.225
while you, next, find the transmitter
that's sending the messages.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.519
Where is it? How does it work?
Who has access to it?

12:08.602 --> 12:09.895
Can it be disabled or shut down?

12:09.979 --> 12:11.772
-Or destroyed.
-Well, that's the same thing.

12:11.856 --> 12:12.982
-No. Okay.
-No. Okay.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.358
Probably also gonna want us

12:14.442 --> 12:17.319
to do some sneaking around,
maybe break into some offices.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.529
I don't. No.

12:18.612 --> 12:23.033
You must keep
a very, very, very low profile. All right?

12:23.117 --> 12:26.120
Please, please, please, please
do not take any unnecessary risks.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.580
Please, please, please.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.999
Just find out what you can,
report back to me.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.127
Understood. Minimal sneaking.
Break-ins only when necessary.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.211
Or never.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.046
But absorb everything.

12:36.130 --> 12:40.176
Every odd detail, every suspicious aspect,
curious tidbit.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.552
Nothing is too small.

12:41.635 --> 12:44.263
Sticky, I imagine
you'll be quite effective at this thing.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.099
-Get a grip, man.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.478
I don't know why I got picked for this.
I really don't.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.104
BENEDICT: Well, I do, Mr. Washington.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.315
Nothing escapes you. That's who you are.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.110
And I consider myself
an excellent judge of character.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.991
So, how will we be communicating with you?

13:04.074 --> 13:06.744
Hmm. I was hoping to use
homing pigeons for this,

13:06.827 --> 13:08.788
but training
did not proceed as planned, so...

13:08.871 --> 13:10.498
-Those are awful birds.
-BENEDICT: They're just atrocious.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.124
We've been eating pigeon for months.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.250
Instead,

13:13.334 --> 13:17.379
we will be using
Morse code signaled by flashlights.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.758
But, rest assured,

13:20.841 --> 13:24.220
we will be watching from a hidden position
on the mainland

13:24.637 --> 13:26.055
at all times.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.558
All times, day and night,
we will always have eyes on you.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.769
Will code names be needed?

13:31.852 --> 13:34.021
Will somewhat long-ish code names work?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.398
No. You'll be using your own names
to enroll.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.691
Now...

13:37.775 --> 13:38.859
Oh, my.

13:38.943 --> 13:43.072
Signatures must be forged, orders given,
bribes paid, and calls made.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.657
Now, while we do that, I highly suggest

13:44.740 --> 13:46.575
that you familiarize yourself
with the dossiers

13:47.034 --> 13:49.662
and brush up on your Morse code. Hmm.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.083
I don't know Morse code.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.459
-Oh.
-STICKY: I do!

13:56.126 --> 13:58.629
I know Morse code. I can teach you.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.172
Wonderful.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.894
"Quick brown fox
jumps over the lazy frog."

14:14.144 --> 14:17.356
That's good,
but it's usually a dog, right?

14:17.439 --> 14:19.567
Frogs are the better animals, technically.

14:20.609 --> 14:23.153
Reynie, guess what this word is.

14:30.619 --> 14:33.247
I'd rather not say that word.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.165
You guys are doing really well.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.334
Whatever, George Washington.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.295
I really prefer Sticky.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.088
Okay, George.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.712
STICKY: You might've noticed
that my head holds a lot of information.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.673
Well, my aunt noticed, too.

15:25.382 --> 15:28.802
I went to live with her and her husband
after my parents died.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.804
Why does it have to rain so much?

15:30.888 --> 15:34.183
It's actually the result
of a number of different factors.

15:34.266 --> 15:38.604
The atmospheric and sea temperatures
are in a warming phase

15:38.687 --> 15:41.607
with a weakening
of the pressure-gradient force,

15:41.690 --> 15:44.276
and causes the ocean surface temperatures

15:44.360 --> 15:45.903
to rise, resulting...

15:45.986 --> 15:47.112
STICKY: I just liked reading,

15:47.196 --> 15:50.240
but they thought it'd be good for me
to take advantage of my gift.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.161
Spell the letter H.

15:58.332 --> 16:02.544
A-I-T-C-H.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.004
Correct!

16:04.088 --> 16:05.798
-

16:09.301 --> 16:10.302
Who knew?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.221
STICKY: At first, it was fun.

16:12.721 --> 16:13.973
The Strait of Hormuz.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.265
Emerson Fittipaldi.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.392
Shoemaker Levy-9.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.476
The Danse Macabre.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.061
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.530
-Yeah!

16:29.613 --> 16:30.990
-You got the car!
-We got it!

16:32.908 --> 16:35.077
STICKY: But the more I won,
the more they wanted.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.914
3.1415926

16:38.998 --> 16:44.837
5358979323846264...

16:49.633 --> 16:51.343
-2?
-

16:51.427 --> 16:54.013
-Oh, so sorry.
-

16:54.096 --> 16:55.556
-STICKY: So, I pretended

16:55.639 --> 16:57.182
to run away to see how they'd react.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.185
I found a place where I could watch them.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.189
Well, I guess
he didn't really want to be here anyway.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.817
Maybe...

17:07.526 --> 17:08.986
maybe it's for the best.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.196
We never asked for this.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.575
He's a smart kid, but...

17:18.996 --> 17:20.664
So then, I ran away for real.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.050
There's not much else to say.

17:31.258 --> 17:34.386
I snuck into the library,
lived there for a couple weeks.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.056
Then I saw Mr. Benedict's ad.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.437
Sticky, that's awful. I'm so sorry.

17:43.854 --> 17:44.855
STICKY: Thanks.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.399
I guess, somehow, it's for the best.

17:47.483 --> 17:51.528
They don't have all that responsibility,
and I don't have all that pressure.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.447
So, it's okay.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.825
I have no idea what to say.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.498
Well, you know, you have us now.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.550
So, what the heck's your story?

18:13.634 --> 18:14.885
REYNIE: Constance.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.304
-What?
-You shouldn't be saying that.

18:20.766 --> 18:24.728
I have just one memory.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.403
I wake blindfolded,
strapped to a metal chair.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.738
My hands and feet are chained.

18:34.822 --> 18:38.200
My head is clamped
into some metal restraint.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.119
I'm bruised and cold.

18:40.202 --> 18:44.498
I hear rushing water and a rat, or...

18:45.582 --> 18:48.335
a very husky mouse.

18:48.752 --> 18:53.799
I can't remember where I am,
how I got here, what my name is.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.050
Amnesia.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.593
Amnesia.

18:59.555 --> 19:03.183
My captors return.
Or maybe they never left. Questions.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.686
What do I remember? What do I remember?

19:05.769 --> 19:08.564
A slap and another slap.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.192
My blindfold is dislodged slightly.

19:12.276 --> 19:15.696
As I'm shuffled back towards my cell,
I realize I'm clutching something.

19:15.779 --> 19:20.325
In my hand, a small key
fashioned from toenail clippings.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.494
Mine? I can only assume.

19:22.578 --> 19:26.790
I trip myself,
using the distraction to unlock my chains.

19:26.874 --> 19:30.460
I fight my captors
with the elephant rage of a desperate man.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.546
I best them. I run.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.675
Away from the building.
Down the hill. The grass is slick.

19:36.758 --> 19:41.263
I tumble and fall off of a cliff
and into the bay.

19:48.478 --> 19:52.316
A venomous eel locks onto my ankle,

19:52.900 --> 19:56.028
its creeping poison
rendering my right leg immobile.

19:56.111 --> 19:59.281
If I wasn't a left-footed swimmer,
I might have drowned.

19:59.364 --> 20:04.036
I use a modified turtle stroke
until I wash ashore.

20:05.204 --> 20:10.876
Half mad,
I survive on peat moss and grub worms

20:10.959 --> 20:15.672
until I regain my strength
and make my way to the city.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.132
But...

20:19.134 --> 20:22.554
no one believes my tale. I am...

20:23.805 --> 20:25.098
laughed at,

20:26.225 --> 20:29.019
pelted with garbage,

20:31.021 --> 20:33.023
an outcast. I...

20:35.484 --> 20:36.818
I am nothing.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.864
I am no one.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.496
But...

20:48.538 --> 20:50.123
I hear talk,

20:51.250 --> 20:52.876
talk of a man.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.547
A brilliant, compassionate man

20:57.631 --> 21:00.300
who seems to know
about all manner of things.

21:03.262 --> 21:07.474
A man who will listen.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.398
That was pretty wordy.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.276
Did you ever get any of your memory back?

21:18.318 --> 21:19.319
No.

21:20.487 --> 21:23.240
But Mr. Benedict always believed me.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.951
Brought me in, gave me a job,

21:26.034 --> 21:28.870
and helped me sort out things
as best he could. It...

21:31.415 --> 21:33.208
It is connected.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.880
It is all connected.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.851
I owe everything to Mr. Benedict.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.811
And for that,

21:54.187 --> 21:56.773
he has my undying loyalty.

22:07.492 --> 22:11.913
"I am terrified."

22:12.414 --> 22:13.498
Exactly!

22:14.249 --> 22:15.375
Are you?

22:15.959 --> 22:17.085
Terrified?

22:17.919 --> 22:18.920
Yeah.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.839
Then don't go.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.927
Constance, do you wanna practice at all?

22:36.646 --> 22:38.357
I have a poem to read.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.567
Oh, fantastic.

22:44.863 --> 22:49.368
"In a land far away where 'twas never day,

22:49.868 --> 22:54.373
gargoyles, three, tormented me.

22:55.457 --> 23:00.253
Kateena Smelleral
had a head full of gears.

23:01.213 --> 23:05.008
Reynardo ate cat food and picked his ears.

23:06.843 --> 23:11.348
While Stinky, all day, pooped in fear."

23:11.973 --> 23:13.642
I can't help it.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.019
Just what it says.

23:18.355 --> 23:22.109
"Each was annoying and soft as dough,

23:22.401 --> 23:25.445
and that is all you need to know."

23:27.239 --> 23:28.407
The end.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.953
It's called
The Tale of the Annoying Three.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.872
-Yeah, I think I get it.
-Vivid imagery.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.255
-Yeah, keep walking!
-

23:43.338 --> 23:44.464
CONSTANCE: I plan to.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.299
-

23:46.967 --> 23:49.344
She's not such a great wordsmith.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.846
KATE: All she does is insult us!

23:50.929 --> 23:52.848
She's like an anti-teammate.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.141
How are we supposed to succeed

23:54.224 --> 23:56.393
with someone
actively trying to throw us off?

23:56.476 --> 23:57.811
Kate's right.

23:57.894 --> 23:59.980
She's only going to make
a dangerous thing harder.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.190
I feel the same way.

24:03.108 --> 24:06.278
But why would Mr. Benedict let her join us
if she wasn't important?

24:07.279 --> 24:10.782
We need to ask Benedict to drop her,
for all our sakes.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.827
Reynie, go talk to him.

24:14.327 --> 24:16.163
What? Why me?

24:16.246 --> 24:17.706
Because you're the only one who can.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.083
If Sticky goes, he'll just implode.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.626
-No offense.
-None taken.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.421
If I go, I'll just complain about her.
A lot.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.256
I have a list.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.468
So, you're the guy.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.360
BENEDICT: Come in!

25:03.460 --> 25:06.713
Oh, hello.
I'm just having a late-night snack.

25:07.047 --> 25:07.964
Biscuit?

25:08.965 --> 25:10.175
No, thank you.

25:11.927 --> 25:15.347
I assume you're here about Constance.

25:20.310 --> 25:21.728
Constance Contraire?

25:22.145 --> 25:23.480
Grumpy girl about yea high?

25:23.563 --> 25:25.148
Yeah, I know who she...

25:28.735 --> 25:29.778
Yes.

25:30.570 --> 25:34.241
And that you speak not just for yourself,
but Kate and Sticky as well, hmm?

25:35.367 --> 25:36.451
Yes.

25:36.826 --> 25:37.994
We...

25:38.078 --> 25:40.247
And I feel bad about this, but...

25:41.665 --> 25:43.917
we don't think she should be on the team.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.505
I know. I know.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.591
And after what you've seen,
I can understand that.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.261
Please, sit.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.434
Oh, you see, um...

26:03.061 --> 26:07.941
Constance is much more gifted
than she seems.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.651
And much better.

26:11.194 --> 26:14.072
In many ways, I think she might be the key
to our success.

26:15.323 --> 26:16.783
But it is important that you know

26:16.866 --> 26:21.246
that my opinion is not based
on unruly optimism or pity,

26:21.329 --> 26:24.291
and that, while I have my opinion,
I value yours.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.252
-You don't want a biscuit? No?
-No, thank you.

26:27.335 --> 26:28.420
You want a biscuit?

26:29.045 --> 26:30.255
Ah...

26:33.758 --> 26:39.472
Do you know the parable
of the West Aleutian Wise Woman, hmm?

26:39.848 --> 26:41.016
-No.
-No?

26:41.099 --> 26:42.601
Well, that makes sense. No one does.

26:43.518 --> 26:44.769
Well, it goes like this.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.689
There was a very mischievous boy...

26:47.772 --> 26:50.525
Oh, I'm not saying you're mischievous,
that's not the point. Sorry.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.153
And a very wise village woman.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.863
And the boy thinks

26:54.946 --> 26:58.033
the woman acts like she knows everything
and has never been wrong.

26:58.116 --> 27:01.328
And he wants very badly, for some reason,
to prove she's wrong.

27:01.411 --> 27:05.665
So, he hides a very small bird
in his hands, and he asks the woman,

27:05.749 --> 27:08.043
"Is this bird alive or dead?"

27:08.835 --> 27:11.129
If she says "dead," he'll let it fly free.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.006
But if she says "alive,"

27:13.089 --> 27:16.176
he will secretly crush it,
so he'll win either way.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.846
-I would never do that.
-Oh, no. I know.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.181
BENEDICT: It's horrible.
It's horrible. It's just a parable.

27:21.264 --> 27:25.143
Anyway, the wise woman looks to the boy
and, in answer to his question, says,

27:25.226 --> 27:28.647
"That, young man, depends on you."

27:29.856 --> 27:31.900
Now, you're not the boy,
I'm not the wise woman,

27:31.983 --> 27:34.444
and Constance is not the bird.
This actually might be the wrong parable.

27:34.527 --> 27:35.487
The only thing relevant

27:35.570 --> 27:39.366
is that I leave this decision completely
in your hands.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.662
Progress report.
The documents will be complete by sunrise.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.829
Ah, thank you.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.415
Now, all right.

27:47.499 --> 27:52.337
Please return to me
with the group's decision, if you may.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.840
Oh, one more thing, um...

27:57.300 --> 27:59.969
How did it feel to come down here
and discuss this with me?

28:01.763 --> 28:03.473
Terrible, sir.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.894
And yet you did it because you had to.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.896
Do you know what that's called?

28:12.774 --> 28:14.150
Carrying a bird?

28:17.153 --> 28:18.488
Leadership.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.952
Good night, Reynie.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.787
Good night.

28:40.593 --> 28:42.178
They'll make the right decision.

28:44.514 --> 28:45.640
They will.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.811
And whatever decision they make
will become the right decision.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.736
REYNIE: Dear Ms. Perumal, it's Reynie.

28:57.819 --> 29:01.614
I wish I could write you a real letter
but this is the best I can do.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.074
How are you?

29:03.658 --> 29:05.493
I'm okay, I guess.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.996
I'm actually
not at the Boatwright Academy.

29:08.705 --> 29:12.667
Apparently, this special opportunity
is a lot more complicated.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.545
At least I'm not alone.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.715
It's exciting to be part of something.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.092
And if Mr. Benedict is right,

29:21.593 --> 29:23.178
what we're doing is important.

29:24.721 --> 29:27.265
But I'm worried that
I'll let everyone down.

29:28.057 --> 29:30.268
Part of me wishes
I was back at the orphanage,

29:30.351 --> 29:32.270
reading the newspaper with you.

29:32.896 --> 29:36.065
I hope you're well.
Say hello to Mr. Rutger.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.818
Love, Reynie.

29:40.528 --> 29:41.362
Muldoon.

29:44.657 --> 29:47.577
KATE: So, I was thinking we'd just go with

29:47.660 --> 29:51.581
The Great Kate Weather Machine
and the Stormriders.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.500
It plays on a weather theme.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.337
Does every teammate get a vote?

29:58.671 --> 30:00.924
Yes, Constance.

30:01.674 --> 30:05.094
Every member of the team
in good standing gets a vote.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.599
How about The Four Kids Gang?

30:09.682 --> 30:11.976
The Secret Agent Children's Group?

30:12.477 --> 30:13.645
Oof.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.147
But those are accurate.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.607
CONSTANCE: Accurate?

30:18.107 --> 30:21.110
How about The Doomed To Fail Club?

30:21.194 --> 30:24.280
I think the name should acknowledge
who brought us together.

30:25.615 --> 30:29.285
Mr. Benedict
and the Great Kate Weathermen.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.246
Kate, seriously, you need to let that go.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.372
REYNIE: I mean...

30:32.455 --> 30:35.291
The Mysterious Benedict Society.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.593
BENEDICT: Well, we're leaving also.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.264
Our home is compromised,
as the events of last night demonstrated,

30:49.347 --> 30:50.598
as a matter of fact...

30:50.682 --> 30:52.851
KATE: Whoa. What's with the get-up?

30:53.601 --> 30:57.355
Milligan was the primary face
that they saw last night,

30:57.438 --> 31:00.692
so we must take every precaution
with your transfer.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.569
Now, remember, children,

31:02.652 --> 31:05.864
we're always just a few dots
and dashes away.

31:07.657 --> 31:11.244
And I'm so proud of you.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.665
RHONDA: Okay. Okay.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.417
Slow.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.502
-Look at the plaid.
-Cleansing, eh?

31:19.586 --> 31:21.129
-It's fine.
-Slow.

31:25.758 --> 31:29.804
Ah, what sweet, sweet memories.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.377
Steady, now.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.714
There's not a thing to worry about.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.678
WORKER 1: The Emergency's gonna end up
costing us our jobs.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.430
WORKER 2:
Yeah, there's nobody at the wheel.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.275
How can I help you?

32:24.359 --> 32:26.736
These are the new transfers.

32:26.819 --> 32:30.907
Three from Binnud Academy, and one from...

32:31.991 --> 32:33.368
Stonetown...

32:34.035 --> 32:35.286
Pardon. Excuse me.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.705
Stonetown Orphanage.

32:38.706 --> 32:40.541
Or... orphanage, yeah.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.568
Just in case.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.581
Well, this is a new one.

33:25.837 --> 33:29.549
Your paperwork is flawless.
I mean, completely flawless.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.802
And you arrived exactly on time,
to the minute.

33:33.511 --> 33:37.223
Welcome to the Institute.
You can head right to the ferry.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.560
This way?

34:45.083 --> 34:46.209
Hello?

34:46.793 --> 34:48.586
It's a test, dummies.

34:54.467 --> 34:55.885
Transfers!

35:02.558 --> 35:04.102
How long have you been waiting?

35:04.185 --> 35:05.853
-Forever.
-Oh, not long.

35:06.145 --> 35:09.190
Hmm. Didn't really take the initiative,
did you?

35:10.233 --> 35:11.776
We followed instructions.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.320
Do you always? Follow instructions?

35:14.904 --> 35:15.988
Ha!

35:17.698 --> 35:19.325
When appropriate.

35:19.408 --> 35:22.453
-Oh, some kind of rebel. I see.
-What?

35:22.537 --> 35:23.830
-Just kidding.
-Totally kidding.

35:28.334 --> 35:30.002
-I'm Jackson.
-And I'm Jillson.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.546
We're in charge of you four.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.381
JACKSON: Let's get you checked
into your rooms.

36:03.077 --> 36:05.997
-This...
-

36:06.080 --> 36:07.832
It's... it's not working.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.085
Oh, those children must be terrified.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.837
You chose the right kids.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.672
Put into a completely foreign environment.

36:14.755 --> 36:17.758
-They can handle it.
-Cast away from everything familiar...

36:17.842 --> 36:20.845
-And they have us, eh?
-This is crazy.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.096
It's crazy.

36:22.555 --> 36:27.560
The bravery of these children,
I have never seen anything like it.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.857
It is such, such bravery.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.279
-Number Two.
-What?

36:38.362 --> 36:40.364
-Again.
-Get him away from the flame.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.033
Mr. Benedict...

36:51.042 --> 36:52.126
This is it.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.630
JILLSON: Satellite TV.
You can watch anytime.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.006
It's great.

36:57.089 --> 36:59.592
You mean, after we get our homework done?

36:59.675 --> 37:00.676
JACKSON: Anytime.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.720
Flip it on right now if you want.
It's encouraged.

37:03.304 --> 37:04.263
Don't worry.

37:04.347 --> 37:06.557
Same screen dimensions
as the ones in the boys' room.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.267
I'm sure they're enjoying it right now.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.568
You're all orphans, huh?

37:18.361 --> 37:19.737
Some of us.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.280
JACKSON: That is sad.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.907
So sad.

37:22.990 --> 37:25.993
But there are ton of orphans here.
It's not a big deal. It's common.

37:26.202 --> 37:28.663
Which is not to say it's a bummer here.
It's upbeat.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.665
The vibe. Unless you make it a bummer.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.375
-We can't control that.
-Hmm.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.969
East campus is all dorms,
with the exception of several classrooms.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.012
North campus encompasses all campuses

37:45.096 --> 37:47.223
except East campus,
including South campus.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.267
It sounds confusing,
but it isn't confusing,

37:49.350 --> 37:52.395
which happens to be an important principle
you'll learn here at the Institute.

37:52.478 --> 37:53.562
What's that?

37:56.565 --> 37:57.733
JACKSON: The Tower.

37:57.817 --> 38:01.737
You have no reason to go there,
unless you become Messengers.

38:01.821 --> 38:04.282
So, not likely
it'll ever become relevant to you.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.913
Not so high on these two.

38:14.333 --> 38:17.211
And, um... who is the headmaster?

38:17.670 --> 38:20.548
He prefers to introduce himself.
You'll meet him soon.

38:21.424 --> 38:22.800
TEACHER: The free market...

38:22.883 --> 38:24.343
STUDENTS: Must always be free.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.720
TEACHER: The free market...

38:25.803 --> 38:27.888
STUDENTS: Must be controlled
in certain cases.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.223
TEACHER: The free market...

38:29.307 --> 38:32.560
STUDENTS: Must be free enough
to control itself in certain cases,

38:32.643 --> 38:35.229
-and have enough control to free itself...
-What are they talking about?

38:35.313 --> 38:36.731
-...in certain cases.
-The free market.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.899
-This is one of the most popular classes.
-TEACHER: The free market...

38:38.983 --> 38:40.776
STUDENTS: Must always be free.

38:45.197 --> 38:46.198
TEACHER: Hello.

38:49.452 --> 38:50.494
Okay.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.872
Mm-hmm. Yes, sir.

38:54.123 --> 38:55.207
Class,

38:55.624 --> 38:57.835
Lindsay will report to Institute Control

38:57.918 --> 39:03.883
where she will be granted special access,
as she is our newest Messenger.

39:04.383 --> 39:06.302
-Lindsay.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.601
Amazing timing that you'd get to see that.

39:13.684 --> 39:16.562
Usually, the headmaster would come down
to give the honor himself.

39:16.645 --> 39:18.606
Oh, well, bad luck.
Don't take it personally.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.399
We'll meet him in the dining hall
for a quick hello,

39:20.524 --> 39:22.151
and it'll be unforgettable.

39:23.110 --> 39:25.321
Wow! Yes. Amazing.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.365
So... so cool.

39:27.865 --> 39:31.243
Anyways, how do you get to be a Messenger?

39:31.327 --> 39:32.828
Strictly merit-based.

39:32.912 --> 39:36.248
You just need to excel in the core classes
and become crème de la crème.

39:37.124 --> 39:38.709
I mean, you four...

39:39.293 --> 39:41.712
It's very exclusive.
I wouldn't count on it.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.340
But anything can happen.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.143
Wow.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.526
When's lunch?

40:03.609 --> 40:06.445
Whenever you want,
if it's here when you are.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.489
What?

40:08.781 --> 40:12.368
Ms. Jillson, it's kind of hard
to understand all these rules.

40:12.451 --> 40:15.454
Rules? There are virtually none.

40:15.538 --> 40:18.082
You can wear whatever you want
that abides by the standards.

40:18.165 --> 40:19.959
You can bathe as much
or as little as you like,

40:20.042 --> 40:21.127
as long as you are clean.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.879
You can keep the lights on all the way up
to lights out at 10:00,

40:23.963 --> 40:25.506
if you choose, and...

40:25.589 --> 40:26.841
You can go wherever you want,

40:26.924 --> 40:28.884
as long as you stay on the paths.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.846
This is all so confusing.

40:32.930 --> 40:33.973
Ah.

40:34.473 --> 40:36.392
He's running a bit behind.

40:36.475 --> 40:38.769
We could wait.
We really do want to meet him.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.856
Of course, you do. You're not insane.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.454
You wanna turn on the TV?

40:57.663 --> 40:59.582
I don't think that's a good idea.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.625
STICKY: Probably right.

41:04.211 --> 41:06.046
It's sort of nice to share a room.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.467
I know. Kids I knew back home,

41:09.550 --> 41:12.803
they used to complain about sharing
with their brothers and sisters.

41:12.887 --> 41:15.097
But I always thought
that sounded pretty good.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.437
Hello?

41:24.106 --> 41:25.024
Hi.

41:32.072 --> 41:33.324
Bucket.

41:35.576 --> 41:36.702
Now you.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.920
Well, we should get moving.

41:46.712 --> 41:49.048
To make contact with Mr. Benedict.

41:49.465 --> 41:50.674
On the first night?

41:50.925 --> 41:53.969
We haven't found, you know, a name yet.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.639
At least we can say it's a he.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.359
I'm hoping we don't always have
to squeeze through that bathroom window

42:08.442 --> 42:09.485
to get out at night.

42:09.568 --> 42:10.903
Stealth has a price.

42:10.986 --> 42:13.197
Adapt or die, George.

42:13.989 --> 42:16.617
Sticky's the best at Morse code.
So, go for it.

42:28.921 --> 42:30.464
-STICKY: There they are.
-KATE: Okay.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.716
KATE: Use the code
to tell them we're safe.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.802
Which would be...

42:34.885 --> 42:35.928
We're saltines.

42:36.011 --> 42:36.971
What?

42:37.429 --> 42:39.848
Well, saltines. Crackers.

42:39.932 --> 42:41.767
Safe crackers.

42:42.518 --> 42:45.980
Yeah, I wasn't paying attention
during that part.

42:47.481 --> 42:49.275
Let's tell them about the Messengers.

42:49.900 --> 42:50.985
Right.

42:51.068 --> 42:53.153
That's gonna be a little complicated.

42:53.529 --> 42:55.906
Why do we have to communicate in riddles?

42:56.198 --> 42:57.950
An abundance of caution?

42:59.285 --> 43:01.704
"Hide"? What's that? A pelt?

43:02.997 --> 43:06.083
Dr. Jekyll, maybe?
We never went over that one.

43:07.459 --> 43:09.211
He's still saying "hide."

43:09.295 --> 43:10.629
Oh, hide, hide!

43:22.308 --> 43:23.684
MAN 2: I know I saw something.

43:28.897 --> 43:31.525
Based on
the flashlight's movement patterns,

43:31.609 --> 43:33.068
I think they're okay.

43:35.613 --> 43:36.947
Oh, good.

43:37.865 --> 43:41.201
Oh, I'm okay, dear. I'm stable.
Thank you. Hmm.

43:41.785 --> 43:44.246
-Why don't you head inside?
-Hmm.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.125
RHONDA: Your carpentry skills are amazing.

43:48.208 --> 43:49.501
Goodness.

43:52.546 --> 43:54.757
-Woodworking is a passion.
-Ah.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.729
Um, Kate? The dorm is that way.

44:09.188 --> 44:12.024
You guys go back. I'm going up there.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.485
You think the transmitter's up there?

44:14.777 --> 44:18.030
Don't know.
But nothing good ever happens in a tower.

44:18.113 --> 44:19.448
Thought I might go right at it!

44:20.074 --> 44:23.202
Or up the side and through the window.

44:23.285 --> 44:26.121
It's too dangerous and too soon.

44:26.830 --> 44:28.499
How are we supposed to climb up that?

44:28.582 --> 44:31.919
Not you. Me. By myself.

44:33.087 --> 44:34.254
With my bucket.

44:34.713 --> 44:36.924
Oh, no. You might fall.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.593
We're a team, Kate.

44:39.677 --> 44:41.679
So, that means we have to all vote
on everything now?

44:41.762 --> 44:43.847
If you get caught, it comes back on us.

44:45.099 --> 44:47.601
Look, she's thinking.

44:48.143 --> 44:50.646
You have a personality flaw.

44:51.397 --> 44:53.023
Why would I care what you think?

44:53.482 --> 44:54.983
You're not perceptive.

44:55.442 --> 44:57.111
Can we go back to the rooms now?

44:58.529 --> 44:59.530
Team?

45:33.856 --> 45:35.315
Hello!

45:37.776 --> 45:38.902
Welcome.

45:40.028 --> 45:42.781
I recognize a lot of you from the halls,

45:43.741 --> 45:48.287
but I also see some new faces among us.

45:49.329 --> 45:50.539
Exciting.

45:52.624 --> 45:53.792
So...

45:55.544 --> 45:56.962
I am...

46:01.800 --> 46:03.594
Mr. Oshiro.

46:04.511 --> 46:08.140
And this class is called
"Psychopractical Problem Dynamics".

46:08.223 --> 46:09.266
Don't be alarmed.

46:09.349 --> 46:11.643
That's really just a fancy term for system

46:11.727 --> 46:15.147
and/or practice-based
mental acuity enhancement,

46:15.522 --> 46:18.275
based on both real-world
and abstract enigmas and conundrums.

46:18.358 --> 46:20.486
It's fun, I promise.

46:21.487 --> 46:22.529
I like him.

46:22.613 --> 46:25.115
So, why don't we dive right in?

46:25.783 --> 46:26.700
As you can see,

46:26.784 --> 46:29.244
there are three light switches
on the wall,

46:29.870 --> 46:33.248
one of which activates the lamp
in the classroom directly above us,

46:33.332 --> 46:35.667
which we obviously can't see from here.

46:36.460 --> 46:39.046
If you're only allowed
to check up there once,

46:39.129 --> 46:44.176
how can you determine
which switch activates the lamp?

47:04.988 --> 47:06.573
Yes, Martina?

47:11.620 --> 47:13.914
Taking into consideration
number selection bias,

47:13.997 --> 47:16.291
the assumed IQ range
of the puzzle designer,

47:16.375 --> 47:17.501
and the widespread knowledge

47:17.584 --> 47:20.003
of the rock-paper-scissors
wrap-around opening gambit,

47:20.087 --> 47:24.842
one must conclude that the first switch
will, ironically,

47:24.925 --> 47:27.427
always be the active one.

47:29.930 --> 47:31.807
Your reasoning is incorrect.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.060
Any other ideas?

47:35.394 --> 47:37.271
-A very long dental mirror.
-No.

47:37.354 --> 47:39.439
Three spools of twine
and a personal dirigible.

47:39.523 --> 47:41.984
-No.
-Flip it and flip it and flip it?

47:42.609 --> 47:43.861
I'm sorry, no.

47:43.944 --> 47:46.405
A small trained dog
with a photovoltaic vest.

47:46.488 --> 47:48.198
Interesting approach, but, no.

47:50.826 --> 47:53.453
Yes... Reynard?

47:54.496 --> 47:55.998
It's Reynie.

47:56.748 --> 48:00.961
I think what I would do
is flip the first switch.

48:02.462 --> 48:03.922
REYNIE: Then wait ten minutes.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.887
Then I'd turn it off
and flip the second switch.

48:10.596 --> 48:12.347
Then I'd check upstairs.

48:16.935 --> 48:20.397
If the light is on,
then it's the second switch.

48:21.773 --> 48:23.150
If the light is off...

48:25.193 --> 48:26.570
then I'd touch the bulb.

48:28.947 --> 48:31.283
If it's hot,
then the first switch is the one.

48:31.658 --> 48:32.576
And if it's cold...

48:35.078 --> 48:36.496
then it's the third switch.

48:38.498 --> 48:41.376
Very nice, Reynie. Well reasoned.

48:44.296 --> 48:46.214
Yes, that's great. Love Reynie.

48:46.298 --> 48:49.384
But that's a lot of work
when it's obviously the second switch.

48:49.968 --> 48:51.136
Why do you say that?

48:51.219 --> 48:53.388
Any competent builder
would place the light switch

48:53.472 --> 48:56.016
one and a half inches out
from the king stud of the doorjamb.

48:56.099 --> 48:57.684
And that would be the second switch.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.603
The other two are clearly dummy switches.

48:59.686 --> 49:01.897
I think the focus is less in construction
and more...

49:01.980 --> 49:03.523
I highly doubt that a school such as this

49:03.607 --> 49:05.359
would contract
with a less-than-competent-builder.

49:05.442 --> 49:06.610
I think you're missing the point.

49:06.693 --> 49:08.278
-Is it the second switch?
-Ms. Wetherall...

49:08.362 --> 49:09.696
Is it the second switch?

49:13.617 --> 49:14.576
Yes.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.579
-DR. L.D. CURTAIN: Wow.

49:18.455 --> 49:19.748
Wow.

49:19.831 --> 49:21.583
Wonderful. Wonderful.

49:24.628 --> 49:28.966
That's some insight right there.
Such creativity. Gracious.

49:30.717 --> 49:32.344
Welcome, new students.

49:33.512 --> 49:36.014
I'm your headmaster, Dr. L.D. Curtain.

49:42.562 --> 49:44.147
I tell you...

49:47.067 --> 49:48.318
These two...

49:49.695 --> 49:51.571
these two are ones to watch.
