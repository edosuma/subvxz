00:08.005 --> 00:09.674
<i>Come on!</i>

00:09.757 --> 00:12.426
Oh, is it this guy?
Never travel without it.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.428
<i>Stop holding up the line, idiot!</i>

00:14.512 --> 00:16.347
It's not his fault.
He's just doing his job.

00:16.472 --> 00:18.015
<i>It's your fault, dummy.</i>

00:18.098 --> 00:20.059
I'm sorry, sir, no
liquid over three ounces.

00:20.142 --> 00:22.186
This is Pappy Van Winkle, friend.

00:22.269 --> 00:25.356
Do you know how old this bourbon is?
If this was a person,

00:25.439 --> 00:27.483
I would've stopped having
sex with it a year ago.

00:27.567 --> 00:29.944
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Do you know who I am?

00:30.027 --> 00:31.654
<i>Come on.</i>

00:31.738 --> 00:33.280
I'm actually a huge celebrity
on my way to New York

00:33.364 --> 00:35.616
for an important meeting
with a book publisher,

00:35.700 --> 00:40.413
who wants to publish a book
about me because I am famous.

00:40.496 --> 00:41.873
- That's not...
- Fine, you want me to dance?

00:41.956 --> 00:42.957
I'll dance.

00:45.209 --> 00:46.961
Give me ten seconds, Diane.

00:47.044 --> 00:49.589
This guy's being a total fascist.
Diane?

00:49.672 --> 00:51.966
- Diane?
- Over here, BoJack.

00:52.049 --> 00:53.593
How'd you get through so fast?

00:53.676 --> 00:55.219
I followed the basic
requirements for air travel

00:55.302 --> 00:56.637
that have been in place for over a decade.

00:56.721 --> 00:59.348
- Ugh, weird.
- Sir, whoever you are, please...

00:59.432 --> 01:01.768
Really?
You've never heard of my TV show?

01:01.851 --> 01:03.644
You know very well who I am.

01:03.728 --> 01:05.772
And now if you'll excuse
me, I'm going to New York.

01:05.855 --> 01:07.398
<i>Ah, no.</i>

01:07.481 --> 01:08.816
<i>- More?
- Come on!</i>

01:08.900 --> 01:10.526
Oh, you know what?
Could be this.

01:10.610 --> 01:12.194
Oh, my God, he's got a gun.

01:12.278 --> 01:14.447
Relax, it's a lighter.

01:14.530 --> 01:16.449
How much lighter fluid
can I take on the plane?

01:16.532 --> 01:19.201
And before you answer,
remember, I'm a celebrity.

01:19.285 --> 01:21.495
We're gonna need a full body cavity search.

<i>Thanks for coming to New York for this.</i>

02:23.933 --> 02:25.977
Let's just say, it's better
for everyone's kneecaps

02:26.060 --> 02:28.312
if I stay out of
California for a little bit.

02:28.395 --> 02:30.731
Always nice to get a change
of scenery, am I right?

02:30.815 --> 02:32.775
I think the New York air's
been good for my health.

02:32.859 --> 02:36.737
I mean, I did find a lump,
but hey, who needs health insurance

02:36.821 --> 02:40.491
when you've got BoJack
Horseman writing a book, huh?

02:40.574 --> 02:42.284
How's it coming along?

02:42.368 --> 02:45.467
It's great. I'm pumping out
heartfelt anecdotes and witty

02:45.468 --> 02:49.208
observations left and right, and
this one is spinning it all into gold.

02:49.291 --> 02:51.335
<i>Your telephone is ringing.
I'm Ira Glass.</i>

02:51.418 --> 02:53.880
<i>Thank you for being a sustaining
member of public radio.</i>

02:53.963 --> 02:55.589
<i>Everyone has a story,</i>

02:55.673 --> 02:57.466
<i>and your phone's story
is that it's ringing.</i>

02:57.550 --> 03:00.761
- Excuse me. Hello?
- Hurry back, superstar.

03:00.845 --> 03:02.304
I don't think Diane's working out.

03:02.388 --> 03:05.975
- What? Why? Is Diane no good?
- She's too good.

03:06.059 --> 03:08.519
I don't know if Diane is
damaged enough to tell my story.

03:08.602 --> 03:10.604
She's so... functional.

03:10.688 --> 03:13.858
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Horseman,
she's too functional.

03:13.941 --> 03:16.986
Why don't I just get on the phone
and call a less functional...

03:17.070 --> 03:18.905
What are you talking about?

03:18.988 --> 03:21.991
- This is a very bad time, BoJack!
- All right.

03:22.075 --> 03:24.459
You need to promise me that your book

03:24.460 --> 03:26.954
will be on the shelves and
making money by October!

03:27.038 --> 03:28.622
All right. Jesus.

03:28.706 --> 03:29.874
<i>Uh-huh?
Uh-huh.</i>

03:29.957 --> 03:33.293
Uh-huh.
Got it. Sorry I took so long.

03:33.377 --> 03:34.837
Who was that? The library?

03:34.921 --> 03:37.297
Thanking you for never
returning a book late?

03:37.381 --> 03:39.216
That was my brother Tommy.
My dad just died.

03:39.299 --> 03:40.801
Oh, my God.

03:40.885 --> 03:42.302
Did we talk about firming
up the release date?

03:42.386 --> 03:44.179
- I was thinking late September.
- I am so sorry.

03:44.304 --> 03:46.015
It's fine, he was old and also the worst.

03:46.099 --> 03:49.560
Such a terrible tragedy
really puts everything in perspective.

03:49.643 --> 03:51.729
Where does that leave us as
far as the book of it all?

03:51.812 --> 03:54.398
Not a problem.
I just got to swing by Boston

03:54.481 --> 03:57.276
and give my condolences real quick.
BoJack can come with me.

03:57.359 --> 03:59.157
We'll get some work done
while we're there, and then

03:59.158 --> 04:00.988
that way the whole trip won't
be a total waste of time.

04:01.072 --> 04:03.365
Great.
Call me if you need anything,

04:03.449 --> 04:06.369
but hang up after one ring,
and I'll call you back

04:06.370 --> 04:09.288

my wife and I are living.

04:47.868 --> 04:50.370
Well, seal's broken.
Might as well enjoy myself.

04:53.499 --> 04:54.834
Whee!

04:56.169 --> 04:58.462
Cheers to bath time.

04:59.755 --> 05:03.592
Great story, Todd. I love our friendship.

05:05.678 --> 05:09.431
Here we go!
The great Toddini!

05:09.515 --> 05:11.017
<i>And here we have the home</i>

05:11.100 --> 05:16.480
of a truly dynamic and unique talent,
TV's own David Boreanaz.

05:16.563 --> 05:18.191
<i> Ohh!</i>

05:18.273 --> 05:22.153
Sounds like we have some fans
of Person of Interest on board,

05:22.236 --> 05:25.280
or Castle, or whatever his show is.

05:25.364 --> 05:27.741
Sorry, dudes, you got the wrong house.

05:27.825 --> 05:29.284
<i> Aww.</i>

05:29.368 --> 05:34.123
Crikey, I would've paid $50 U.S.
to see where David Boreanaz lives.

05:34.207 --> 05:36.083
He's the American Hugh Jackman.

05:36.167 --> 05:38.711
<i>- Oh, yeah, 50 bucks?
- He's so good in Burn Notice.</i>

05:38.794 --> 05:40.546
What? 50 bucks?

05:40.629 --> 05:42.339
In that case, come on in, friends.

05:42.422 --> 05:44.424
Some guy named David Boreanaz lives here.

05:44.508 --> 05:47.386
<i> Hooray!</i>

05:47.469 --> 05:49.013
Hey, so listen,

05:49.096 --> 05:50.931
I really want to be here
for you in your time of need,

05:51.015 --> 05:52.641
but I'm not really good
with funerals or death

05:52.725 --> 05:54.268
or families or feelings or people.

05:54.351 --> 05:56.103
Don't worry. You can wait in the car.

05:56.187 --> 05:57.771
It's probably better you
don't meet my brothers.

05:57.855 --> 06:00.066
They're narrow-minded,
mean-spirited dirtbags.

06:00.149 --> 06:01.984
I wish I had brothers growing up.

06:02.068 --> 06:05.571
Touch football on the weekends,
noogie parades on the reg.

06:05.654 --> 06:08.490
Life as an only child
can get pretty lonely.

06:08.574 --> 06:11.577
Daddy, do you want to
meet my imaginary friend?

06:11.660 --> 06:16.123
Imaginary friends are freeloaders
invented by communists to rip-off welfare.

06:16.207 --> 06:18.334
Why don't you do something
productive, like bang your

06:18.335 --> 06:20.460
head against the wall until
your brain isn't so stupid?

06:20.544 --> 06:22.004
Okay, Daddy.

06:22.088 --> 06:24.649
Yeah, well, I was pretty
lonely, too. My family made my

06:24.650 --> 06:27.301
life miserable, and then they
never forgave me for leaving.

06:27.384 --> 06:28.969
So, what, you're like the black sheep?

06:29.053 --> 06:30.804
No, Gary's the black sheep.
He's adopted.

06:30.888 --> 06:32.598
I'm just the member of
the family nobody likes.

06:32.681 --> 06:34.474
And my dad was the worst of them all.

06:34.558 --> 06:36.373
You told me that you
and your father used to

06:36.374 --> 06:38.229
sit on the roof and look
at the stars together.

06:38.312 --> 06:40.898
Oh, yeah, I was just trying
to get you to open up,

06:40.981 --> 06:43.901
so I used an old writer's
trick called "me lying to you."

06:43.984 --> 06:46.070
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm using an old me trick

06:46.153 --> 06:47.613
called "that hurts my feelings."

06:47.696 --> 06:50.851
And the truth is, I used to
sit alone on the hill out by the

06:50.852 --> 06:54.161
dump and dream of waking up as
Chelsea Clinton, but with my hair.

06:54.245 --> 06:57.081
- You do have great hair.
- I know.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.377
That's us.
I'll just pop in for a quick hi and bye.

07:02.461 --> 07:05.256
Then we'll be on our way.
Ten minutes, swear to God.

07:05.339 --> 07:07.716
You can play with this kaleidoscope
I got you at the airport.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.511
What? A kaleidoscope?
I'm not five...

07:11.595 --> 07:13.973
Shapes and colors the likes
of which I've never seen.

07:14.056 --> 07:15.849
Hello.

07:15.933 --> 07:18.685
Hey, yeah, Deedee came home!

07:18.769 --> 07:21.688
Gary, Marty, Artie, Deedee's back!
Come here!

07:21.772 --> 07:23.398
Game. Watching the game.

07:23.482 --> 07:24.775
Can't look up from the game.
How you doing?

07:24.858 --> 07:27.861
Marty, it's a game from '86.
You've seen it a hundred times.

07:27.945 --> 07:29.696
And how many times does
Buckner break your heart?

07:29.780 --> 07:31.240
<i>100 times.</i>

07:31.324 --> 07:33.159
Aw, thank
God you're here, Deedee.

07:33.242 --> 07:34.701
Pops is wicked departed.

07:34.785 --> 07:36.703
Oh, yeah, man. He departed so hard.

07:36.787 --> 07:38.914
And I do not like them apples, Deedee.

07:38.998 --> 07:40.249
Yo, Deedee, get me a beer.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.541
Yeah, make that two, Deedee.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.669
Gary, Marty, I just got home.

07:43.752 --> 07:48.341
Ooh, Princess Diane doesn't
want to get her brother a beer.

07:48.423 --> 07:50.843
Hey, Ma, come look what
the Pats dragged in.

07:50.926 --> 07:55.639
Oh, hello!
Look who decided to come home.

07:55.722 --> 08:00.519
Queen Deedee blesses us with her presence.
To what do I owe the honor?

08:00.602 --> 08:02.396
Look, I'm just here to
offer my condolences.

08:02.479 --> 08:06.400
Oh, sure, in and out, like
a Protestant on Christmas.

08:06.483 --> 08:07.860
Why would you want to stick around,

08:07.943 --> 08:09.278
be with your family in their time of need?

08:09.362 --> 08:12.072
- Come on, Ma.
- Don't fight while the game's on.

08:12.156 --> 08:15.117
- It's bad Juju.
- It's the '86 World Series.

08:15.201 --> 08:17.703
- They lose.
- Ah, why'd you have to...

08:17.786 --> 08:19.830
Oh, we're just a bunch of savages, right?

08:19.913 --> 08:22.333
We're not like your
fancy California friends.

08:22.416 --> 08:25.919
Your George Clooney and
your California Raisins.

08:26.003 --> 08:28.297
Oh, come off it, Ma.
She don't mean no harm.

08:28.381 --> 08:30.590
For five years she didn't come home.

08:30.674 --> 08:33.344
Why don't you make like A-Rod and blow.

08:33.427 --> 08:36.013
Well, this was clearly a huge mistake.

08:36.096 --> 08:38.932
Ah, don't go.
Deedee, please.

08:39.015 --> 08:40.600
Why not? Ma doesn't want me here.

08:40.683 --> 08:42.561
Ma don't know what she wants.

08:42.644 --> 08:45.480
She wants you here. We all do.
Ain't that right, Marty?

08:45.564 --> 08:46.732
Can't look up from the game.

08:46.815 --> 08:49.526
Besides, we need your help
organizing all the funeral stuff.

08:49.609 --> 08:52.112
We didn't go to college.
We're not smart like you.

08:52.196 --> 08:54.823
Fine, I'll help.
Is there a number for me to call?

08:54.907 --> 08:57.492
Yeah, try
1-800-The-Internet, dummy.

08:57.576 --> 08:59.286
Jeez, do some legwork, Dee.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.747
And do it quick.
The ice is melting.

09:01.830 --> 09:03.749
Oh, my God. Is that dad?

09:03.832 --> 09:06.626
Did someone draw balls on his forehead?

09:06.710 --> 09:08.421
That was before we knew he was dead.

09:08.503 --> 09:10.381
We just thought he was wicked hung over.

09:10.464 --> 09:15.469
In your face, Dad!
In your face forever.

Oh, no, no, no, I'll handle

10:06.395 --> 10:08.188
Don't worry, I'm not just gonna sit here

10:08.272 --> 10:10.274
batting a ball of yarn around
while you do the real work.

10:10.357 --> 10:13.319
I want to take your
project to the next level.

10:13.402 --> 10:15.112
We need to go bigger.

10:15.195 --> 10:17.364
Have you thought about attaching
Mila Kunis to this thing?

10:17.448 --> 10:21.535
- Attach her? How?
- You do your job. I'll do mine.

10:21.618 --> 10:23.662
Who is this?

10:25.247 --> 10:27.500
Ah, out of combinations.
Now I'm bored.

10:27.582 --> 10:29.918
Diaaaaane!

10:31.753 --> 10:33.339
- You show me nothing...
- What do you want from me?

10:33.422 --> 10:35.341
You have no right to barge
in here after five years

10:35.424 --> 10:39.094
- and judge us, Diane.
- I'm just saying Marty could lend a hand

10:39.178 --> 10:41.096
instead of sitting on the
couch watching the game all day.

10:41.180 --> 10:45.017
- Ah, Deedee.
- You know very well his leg's still sore

10:45.100 --> 10:46.768
from the accident at the quarry.

10:46.852 --> 10:49.938
Yeah, he's got to rest up if he's
gonna be a wide receiver for B.C.

10:50.022 --> 10:51.773
He didn't get into B.C.

10:51.857 --> 10:53.775
Ah, what's the point of
getting off the couch anyway?

10:53.859 --> 10:55.944
All the jobs are going
to immigrants these days.

10:56.028 --> 10:57.946
What do you... We're immigrants.

10:58.030 --> 10:59.948
- How do you figure?
- We're Vietnamese?

11:00.032 --> 11:02.409
Step off! We're American as fuck.

11:02.493 --> 11:03.910
<i>And that's the same crap you always pull...</i>

11:03.994 --> 11:06.872
<i>What do you want from me?
Come on!</i>

11:06.955 --> 11:09.875
Excuse me.
Yes, hello, I'm looking for Diane.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.544
Does anyone here speak English?

11:11.626 --> 11:14.046
Pull over and park the car.

11:14.129 --> 11:16.923
Is that the frickin'
horse from Horsin' Around?

11:17.007 --> 11:19.759
Again, does anyone here speak English?

11:19.843 --> 11:23.472
- Oh, no way...
- What? A TV star!

11:25.849 --> 11:27.059
Boreanaz house.

11:27.142 --> 11:29.436
Seventy-five each.
Children and seniors free.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.885
Please stay behind
the ropes and keep your

11:31.886 --> 11:34.525
hands and belongings on
your person at all times.

11:34.608 --> 11:37.319
Next we'll head to the kitchen where...
Is that Mila Kunis?

11:37.403 --> 11:38.945
<i>Ooh!</i>

11:39.029 --> 11:41.781
Note the letters B.H. on
all hand towels and linens.

11:41.865 --> 11:43.867
That stands for "Boreanaz House."

11:48.121 --> 11:50.290
Yeah, do you pick up bodies?

11:50.374 --> 11:52.376
Is that a service you provide?
Corpse removal?

11:52.459 --> 11:55.754
Hey, BoJack, you ever meet
any Boston celebrities?

11:55.837 --> 11:57.631
Well, one time at Bristol Farms,

11:57.714 --> 12:00.717
Ben Affleck and I did reach
for the same bunch of grapes.

12:00.800 --> 12:05.389
Oh, he eats grapes just like us?
Hey, Ma, Ben Affleck eats grapes!

12:05.472 --> 12:07.057
<i> He don't eat grapes!</i>

12:07.140 --> 12:09.768
BoJack said he fed Affleck grapes.

12:09.851 --> 12:12.104
He was graping it up with
the Daredevil himself.

12:12.187 --> 12:16.316
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Oh!

12:16.400 --> 12:18.237
Hey, I don't suppose
you boys would have any

12:18.238 --> 12:20.320
interest in maybe playing
some touch football later?

12:20.404 --> 12:23.115
Are you kidding?
Touch football with a star like you?

12:23.198 --> 12:25.158
That would be mad wicked pisser.

12:25.242 --> 12:26.701
Ooh, you know what else we got to do?

12:26.785 --> 12:29.663
We got to watch the Cryane video.

12:29.746 --> 12:31.290
Ooh, that sounds good. 
What's that?

12:31.373 --> 12:34.418
- No, we don't need to revisit that.
- When Deedee was 16,

12:34.501 --> 12:37.170
we made up a secret pen pal
for her named Leo.

12:37.254 --> 12:40.549
Guys, I really would rather not discuss it.

12:40.633 --> 12:42.468
We all took turns writing her letters,

12:42.551 --> 12:45.720
pretending to be this
sensitive boy from Cambridge.

12:45.804 --> 12:47.473
It was wicked messed up.

12:47.556 --> 12:50.850
"Oh, Diane, we're two misunderstood souls.

12:50.934 --> 12:55.230
Everyone else is a phony.
Yours forever, Leo."

12:55.314 --> 12:59.318
- What? That is amazing.
- After six months of letters,

12:59.401 --> 13:01.820
we hired a homeless
guy to pretend to be Leo

13:01.903 --> 13:04.364
and take her to the homecoming dance.

13:04.448 --> 13:05.782
- Look at her.
- Watch, watch this part.

13:05.865 --> 13:08.992
<i>I like your boutonniÃ¨re.</i>

13:09.027 --> 13:12.372
<i>Why don't we watch this every day?</i>

13:12.456 --> 13:13.748
- Look at her face.
- Now that's a good prank.

13:13.832 --> 13:16.585
- I was humiliated.
- Yeah, you wouldn't get it.

13:16.669 --> 13:18.420
It's a brothers thing, right, brothers?

13:18.504 --> 13:21.840
Whoo! That's Cryane for you.
What a pussy.

13:21.923 --> 13:25.093
You know, it's nice that years later
we can all laugh about this.

13:25.177 --> 13:27.012
Yep, my therapist thinks the same thing.

13:27.095 --> 13:28.972
I'm gonna go meet with
the funeral director.

13:29.055 --> 13:30.641
Any of you boys want to come?

13:30.724 --> 13:32.559
Nah, I ain't so big on
funeral homes, Deedee.

13:32.643 --> 13:34.186
All them dead bodies,
they give me the jeebies.

13:34.269 --> 13:36.730
Yeah, Deedee, why do we got to go?

13:36.813 --> 13:40.233
Fine, none of you have to go.
I'll take care of everything.

13:40.317 --> 13:42.068
Thank you, Diane.
We all really appreciate it.

13:42.152 --> 13:45.374
- Come on, BoJack.
- Why you got to take BoJack with you?!

13:45.409 --> 13:46.198
Boo!

13:46.281 --> 13:48.701
- Boo!
- Boys, you have stolen my heart

13:48.783 --> 13:50.452
like Dave Roberts stole second base.

13:50.536 --> 13:52.663
Hey! He knows our things!

13:52.746 --> 13:55.207
I must go now, but I'll see
you all at the funeral, okay?

13:55.290 --> 13:57.751
And when I do, you're all getting noogies.

13:57.834 --> 13:58.835
- Funeral!
- Yeah!

13:58.918 --> 13:59.919
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

14:00.003 --> 14:01.129
<i> Funeral!</i>

14:01.213 --> 14:02.422
<i>Funeral! Funeral!</i>

14:03.840 --> 14:08.220
And now, a very special treat
just for our platinum members.

14:08.303 --> 14:14.226
Let's take a peek at the slumbering
Mr. Boreanaz himself.

14:14.309 --> 14:17.896
<i>Get out of my room, Todd!
I'm David Boreanaz.</i>

14:17.979 --> 14:19.523
<i> Ohh!</i>

14:19.606 --> 14:21.066
And thus concludes our tour.

14:21.149 --> 14:22.901
Have a Boreanderful day.

14:24.986 --> 14:27.239
Tell me about your father.

14:27.322 --> 14:30.941
Well, he was a mean, sadistic
alcoholic, who never supported

14:30.942 --> 14:34.204
anything I did and actively
delighted in seeing me fail.

14:34.287 --> 14:38.041
Hmm, I see.
Sounds like you're looking for

14:38.042 --> 14:39.834
our Piece of Shit Dad Package.

14:39.918 --> 14:41.754
That would be too good for my father.

14:41.836 --> 14:45.162
Hmm, I see.
Might I then suggest our

14:45.163 --> 14:49.135
Piece of Shit Dad Package
Would Be Too Good For Him Package.

14:49.219 --> 14:52.972
- Yeah, that's the one.
- Excellent choice.

14:53.056 --> 14:55.016
Hey, can I suggest something?

14:55.100 --> 14:57.269
You might want to loosen up a little.

14:57.352 --> 14:59.104
I think you could actually
learn a thing or two

14:59.187 --> 15:01.898
- from your brothers.
- Are you kidding?

15:01.981 --> 15:04.025
If I was like my brothers,
nothing would ever get done.

15:04.109 --> 15:07.188
I'm just saying, if you
can't find a way to let off

15:07.189 --> 15:10.031
some steam you're going to explode.

15:10.115 --> 15:11.866
<i>God damn it!
Are you god damn kidding me?</i>

15:11.950 --> 15:13.452
I keep getting calls
from this unlisted number.

15:13.535 --> 15:15.370
Ignore. Who are these assholes?

15:15.454 --> 15:17.080
Why don't you just answer,
and then you'll know?

15:17.163 --> 15:18.791
Oh, they'd just love that, wouldn't they?

15:18.873 --> 15:22.252
Ugh, how are we supposed to
blackmail him if we can't reach him?

15:22.335 --> 15:24.713
Maybe we got to get him where he lives?

15:24.797 --> 15:29.134
- You mean... ?
- That's right, his house.

15:30.469 --> 15:32.011
<i>What the... Whose house is this?</i>

15:32.095 --> 15:34.180
Is that David Boreanaz?

15:34.264 --> 15:37.100
I could've sworn BoJack
Horseman lived here.

15:37.183 --> 15:38.769
Hey, let's keep these lines moving, huh?

15:38.852 --> 15:42.147
You want to stop and chat, you gotta
pay for the extended stay ticket.

15:42.230 --> 15:44.149
Ah, so much, so much, so much.

15:44.232 --> 15:47.235
Another five Gs, T-Bag,
and we are in the pink.

15:47.319 --> 15:48.737
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.

15:48.821 --> 15:52.407
I ran out of shoeboxes for the money,
and the books aren't adding up.

15:52.491 --> 15:55.392
Plus the men's lav needs
to be serviced, and I had to

15:55.393 --> 15:58.455
fire Janine in the gift shop
for stealing Boreabble heads.

15:58.538 --> 16:01.249
I mean, how did I end up
with all this responsibility?

16:01.333 --> 16:03.460
Hey, I'm not screwing
around here, small fry.

16:03.543 --> 16:07.020
- You better make those numbers sing.
- I don't think these offshore

16:07.021 --> 16:09.716
banks we've been using
are 100% legal.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.177
Yeah, well, my mother told
me never to slap an idiot.

16:12.260 --> 16:13.553
What? Ow!

16:13.637 --> 16:15.555
Now we're both breaking the rules.

16:15.639 --> 16:18.375
You listen, and you listen
good. I've gotten used to

16:18.376 --> 16:21.060
a certain lifestyle since
Boreanaz House went public,

16:21.144 --> 16:22.729
and I'm not going back to the old way.

16:22.813 --> 16:25.607
Mommy likes her shoes, see?
And her pearls.

16:25.691 --> 16:28.943
Oh, I'm in too deep.
I don't know what to do.

16:29.027 --> 16:30.487
<i>I'll tell you what you should do.</i>

16:30.570 --> 16:31.655
Who said that?

16:31.738 --> 16:33.198
<i>It's me, David Boreanaz.</i>

16:33.281 --> 16:35.534
Is that what David Boreanaz sounds like?

16:35.617 --> 16:38.662
<i>Uh, sure.
Let me give you some advice.</i>

16:38.745 --> 16:41.874
<i>As we say on my show...
I want to say, New Girl?...</i>

16:41.956 --> 16:44.292
<i>just keep doing what you're
doing, and you'll be fine.</i>

16:44.376 --> 16:46.461
Wow, thanks, Davie B.

16:46.545 --> 16:49.381
<i>Never call me that!</i>

16:51.090 --> 16:54.887
- Unbelievable.
- It's 4:00. I don't think anyone's coming.

16:54.969 --> 16:57.639
Unbe-goddamn-lievable!

16:57.723 --> 17:02.143
All those jerk wads had to do was show up,
and they couldn't even do that!

17:02.227 --> 17:03.603
Where's the body even?

17:03.687 --> 17:05.939
Beg your pardon, minor hiccup.

17:06.021 --> 17:10.234
My goons went to pick your
father up, but nobody was home.

17:10.318 --> 17:13.445
For a nominal fee, we can
scrounge up another body for you.

17:13.530 --> 17:17.576
Would you care to peruse our loaner closet?

17:20.078 --> 17:22.454
Hey, assholes! Where were you?

17:22.539 --> 17:24.833
I planned the whole funeral,
like you asked me to,

17:24.916 --> 17:28.175
- and nobody showed.
- Yeah, we realized dad wouldn't

17:28.176 --> 17:29.963
have wanted some stuffy funeral.

17:30.046 --> 17:32.215
He would've wanted his body
to be chopped up into chum

17:32.298 --> 17:35.928
- and thrown in Derek Jeter's fat face.
- Yeah, suck it, Jeter!

17:36.010 --> 17:37.679
Wait, what? Where is Dad?

17:37.763 --> 17:39.431
We got him chummed. He's in the truck.

17:41.767 --> 17:45.771
- You chummed Dad?
- It's what your father wanted, honey,

17:45.854 --> 17:48.732
but then you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

17:48.815 --> 17:51.610
Let me get this straight.
So instead of coming to the funeral

17:51.693 --> 17:54.654
that I paid for and
spent all day organizing,

17:54.738 --> 17:57.783
you had Dad's body ground into chum,

17:57.866 --> 18:01.202
so you could throw his
mushy remains on Derek Jeter?

18:01.286 --> 18:05.540
No, not just on Derek Jeter.
We're gonna throw it into his fat face.

18:05.624 --> 18:07.041
- Yeah, his fat face.
- In his fat face.

18:07.125 --> 18:08.460
The Yankees are in town this week.

18:08.543 --> 18:09.878
The planets are aligning, Deedee.

18:09.962 --> 18:12.464
Tommy, you begged me to stay and help.

18:12.547 --> 18:15.926
Why does everything always
got to be about big-shot Diane?

18:16.009 --> 18:20.388
- Too good for her home.
- I don't think I'm too good for my home.

18:20.472 --> 18:22.390
Yeah, guys, you got it all wrong.

18:22.474 --> 18:25.811
Diane isn't a big-shot.
She's my ghostwriter.

18:25.894 --> 18:29.439
She's writing a book that's not
even gonna have her name on it.

18:29.522 --> 18:32.818
You think this is how she expected
her life would be going at 34?

18:32.901 --> 18:35.988
She lives with her rich
boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.

18:36.070 --> 18:39.574
She's not too good for anything.

18:39.658 --> 18:42.243
- What?
- Diane's a freeloader?

18:43.453 --> 18:47.457
- Even I pay rent.
- BoJack helping?

18:52.545 --> 18:53.964
Whoa.

18:54.047 --> 18:58.718
This is why I told you to wait in the car!

18:58.802 --> 19:01.346
Oh, she snapped.
Here comes Cryane.

19:01.471 --> 19:04.057
Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.

19:04.140 --> 19:08.102
Diane, you are making a
public spectacle of yourself.

19:08.186 --> 19:10.647
Deedee, what are you doing with Dad's keys?

19:10.730 --> 19:12.148
Put those back.

19:12.231 --> 19:13.650
Oh, come on, that's Dad's truck.

19:13.733 --> 19:15.068
Dad's chum is in the back.

19:15.151 --> 19:16.653
No! No, no, no!

19:16.736 --> 19:19.113
<i> Suck a dick, dumb shits!</i>

19:19.197 --> 19:21.783
Well, that crazy clam did it.
She took Pops.

19:21.867 --> 19:25.095
Oh, no, what are we gonna do?

19:25.578 --> 19:27.330
<i>And it's a
one-hopper back to the pitcher.</i>

19:27.413 --> 19:31.084
Easy out at first.
So what we're gonna do is nothing?

19:31.167 --> 19:33.211
Sox are on, and I haven't seen this one.

19:33.294 --> 19:35.213
Does anyone know where
she might have gone?

19:35.296 --> 19:37.090
Ah, she used to run off
like this all the time

19:37.173 --> 19:40.468
in high school, too.
Who knows where crazy goes?

19:40.552 --> 19:42.762
I think I know where she went.

19:42.846 --> 19:46.058
Wait, you can't leave.
The party's just getting started.

19:46.140 --> 19:48.476
I don't know, Diane was pretty upset,

19:48.560 --> 19:52.355
- and she's got your dad.
- Oh, don't go, BoJack.

19:52.438 --> 19:53.940
You're like the fifth brother I never had.

19:54.024 --> 19:56.651
- I... Really?
- Yeah, don't leave, bro.

19:56.735 --> 19:59.779
After this, we'll go play touch football
and do a noogie parade.

19:59.863 --> 20:02.240
Ah, um...

20:03.408 --> 20:04.534
<i>Everyone please disperse.</i>

20:04.617 --> 20:08.538
<i>This is an unlawful gathering.
Disperse immediately.</i>

20:10.373 --> 20:12.084
Oh, this isn't looking
good, Princess Carolyn.

20:12.166 --> 20:14.961
- What are we gonna do?
- What do you mean, we?

20:15.045 --> 20:17.589
Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.

20:17.672 --> 20:18.673
Ha!

20:18.757 --> 20:20.466
Mr. Boreanaz, I presume.

20:20.550 --> 20:24.012
Um, would you like a Boreabble head?

20:24.096 --> 20:27.766
The amazing thing is, the house
looks just like BoJack's house.

20:27.849 --> 20:29.642
They must have the same architect.

20:29.726 --> 20:31.269
Anyway, how are things with you?

20:31.352 --> 20:32.812
<i> Not good.</i>

20:32.896 --> 20:35.398
<i>I should've known it was a
waste of time to come back here.</i>

20:35.481 --> 20:38.401
Oh, that's awful.
Well, when you get back,

20:38.484 --> 20:40.403
I'll give you one of my
patented Peanutbutter hugs.

20:40.486 --> 20:42.321
Crunchy and creamy.

20:42.405 --> 20:45.992
You know that patent wasn't
approved, but I'll take it.

20:46.076 --> 20:50.122
<i>- I have to go. BoJack's here.
- BoJack, well, what's he doing... ?</i>

20:50.204 --> 20:53.750
Hey.
Sorry I said all that stuff about you.

20:53.833 --> 20:55.961
It's all true, isn't it?

20:56.044 --> 20:59.756
I found this letter back at the bar.
I think it's for you.

21:01.674 --> 21:03.551
Look, just read it.
I think you'll like it.

21:03.635 --> 21:08.347
"Dear Diane, it's me, your old pen pal Leo.

21:08.431 --> 21:11.517
This definitely isn't BoJack
Horseman writing this."

21:11.601 --> 21:12.811
Keep reading.

21:12.894 --> 21:14.813
"You're a good person, Diane,

21:14.896 --> 21:17.107
and that's the most important thing.

21:17.190 --> 21:18.900
Even if no one appreciates you,

21:18.984 --> 21:21.569
it's important that you
don't stop being good.

21:21.653 --> 21:24.948
I like how you always bring your
own bags to the grocery store,

21:25.031 --> 21:27.659
and how you're always
organized to go places.

21:27.742 --> 21:31.704
I like how you chew gum on the
airplane so your ears will pop.

21:31.788 --> 21:34.707
A lot of people might not
appreciate that about you,

21:34.791 --> 21:38.377
but I do.
Yours forever, Leo."

21:38.461 --> 21:40.964
That's the best letter he ever wrote me.

21:41.047 --> 21:44.050
Look, take it from someone
with his own shitty parents,

21:44.134 --> 21:45.927
family is a sinkhole,

21:46.011 --> 21:48.096
and you were right to get
out when you had the chance.

21:48.180 --> 21:50.732
The stupid thing is,
even now I still just want

21:50.733 --> 21:53.018
them to be proud of me
and think I did good.

21:53.101 --> 21:54.894
Is that really stupid?

21:54.978 --> 21:56.188
- Yep.
- No, it isn't.

21:56.270 --> 21:59.482
Yeah, it is.
You want those guys to be proud of you?

21:59.565 --> 22:01.776
I guess I was just hoping to
get some modicum of closure.

22:01.860 --> 22:05.571
Closure is a made up thing
by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets.

22:05.655 --> 22:09.742
It, like true love and the Munich Olympics,
doesn't exist in the real world.

22:09.826 --> 22:13.371
The only thing to do now is
just to keep living forward.

22:13.454 --> 22:15.915
Yeah, but every time
I come back here they...

22:15.999 --> 22:19.252
So don't come back here.
What's great about Los Angeles

22:19.335 --> 22:21.880
is nobody cares about where
you're from or who you are.

22:21.963 --> 22:24.883
It's a superficial town
where you can worry about stupid shit

22:24.966 --> 22:26.425
like keeping your pool clean,

22:26.509 --> 22:28.220
and what artisanal nuts
to put on your salad.

22:28.302 --> 22:31.139
- I do like salad.
- Oh, it's the best.

22:31.223 --> 22:34.600
- Why do you think people keep moving there?
- Thanks, BoJack.

22:34.684 --> 22:38.897
The good news is, your dad
can't hurt anyone ever again.

You know what to do.

23:23.399 --> 23:29.322
Hey, Herb, look, I think we
have some unfinished business.

23:29.405 --> 23:31.908
It seems like life's
too short to hold grudges

23:31.991 --> 23:34.286
and stuff like that,
you know what I'm saying?

23:34.368 --> 23:36.996
About life being too short?
Well, of course you know what I'm saying.

23:37.080 --> 23:40.416
You're the one with terminal...
I feel like I'm doing all the talking here.

23:40.499 --> 23:42.335

23:44.503 --> 23:48.174

23:48.258 --> 23:51.552
This is BoJack. Horseman.
Obviously.

23:52.971 --> 23:55.974
Ugh, who keeps calling me?

23:56.057 --> 23:59.560
Come on, BoJack.
Pick up, pick up.

23:59.644 --> 24:01.062
