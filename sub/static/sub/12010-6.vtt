WEBVTT

00:04.240 --> 00:05.960
Can't say I have, as it happens.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.960
Ah. Then may I talk to you briefly
about my own candidacy?

00:09.000 --> 00:12.880
Depends. What you got there?
These are my promotional plums, if
you'd like one.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.200
All right. Go on, then, I'm all
ears. Right.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.840
Well... my name is Julius Priscus

00:18.880 --> 00:22.280
and I would like to represent you as
Tribune for the Aventine district.

00:22.320 --> 00:27.320
Oh, sweet. If elected, I pledge to
rebuild our squalid apartment blocks

00:27.360 --> 00:29.360
and clamp down on the crooks who run
them.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.400
That's great that is, yeah. Keep
going.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.640
I will invest in our overstretched
public services. Mm, I love it.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.520
And give the local people whatever it
is they feel they need.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.240
I need another plum.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.400
Finally, I vow to run a clean
campaign with honesty and integrity

00:43.440 --> 00:46.760
to restore this vibrant district to
its former glory.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.840
Magic.
So, can I rely on your vote, then?

00:50.880 --> 00:53.960
No, sorry.
Ah. Ah, why's that?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.120
I'm a slave, aren't I? I can't vote.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.520
Cheers for t'plums, though.

01:00.497 --> 01:15.401

01:15.720 --> 01:17.720
Citizens of the Aventine,

01:17.760 --> 01:22.560
my name is Victor of the Grachaee and
I am a man you can trust.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.920
That is a very bad wig.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.920
I know, it's like a hairy plate.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.800
It's time to stop the rot.

01:30.840 --> 01:36.280
To ban gambling, whoring and fine
anyone having sex outside wedlock.

01:36.320 --> 01:40.240
Wig or no wig that's just crazy talk.
And yet this lot are loving it.

01:40.280 --> 01:43.280
Not just the old codgers but the
young hoys too, like them.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.280
Those two and... Cynthia?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.400
Cynth, what you doing here?

01:50.440 --> 01:53.560
Supporting Victor.
Oh, yeah, why? He's a total dildo.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.680
It's our job. We're hired clappers.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.880
You're what? You're being paid?
Mm.

01:59.920 --> 02:04.640
Proper acting's been a bit thin on
the ground so I'm doing a bit of
clapping work to keep my hand in.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.640
Well, HANDS.
I'm not even listening.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.479
I just wait till the end of the
sentence and go berserk.

02:09.520 --> 02:13.320
There should be no public
toplessness, even in hot weather.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.160
I will ban public urination.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.400
I actually agree with that one.
You guys should totally sign up.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.120
It's as simple as that.
But you really hate his policies.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.320
Yeah, but I really fancy his
supporters.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.160
I'd really be applauding them. And we
need the extra cash.

02:39.200 --> 02:43.000
I'm not working on my week off. I
don't care how fit his followers
are.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.960
Salve, boys.
Hi, Landlord.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.560
Well, not great actually. My knee's
giving me gyp.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.480
Got this crap on the walls and I've
got to tell the tenants the rent's
going up. Again?

02:52.520 --> 02:54.400
Yeah, I know, it's a bloody nuisance.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.560
Not for you, you're the one doing
it. No, it's not me mate, no, no.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.720
I'm just a tiny cog in a big wheel.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.480
Yeah, there are forces out there
that are bigger than the both of us.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.520
Number 12's all paid up.
Lovely.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.440
You all right, lads?
Ooh!

03:09.560 --> 03:11.960
Ah, nose bleed. Just sort of...

03:16.520 --> 03:19.240
Actually, the extra cash could be
good.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.400
Name and profession?
Marcus Gallow. I'm a copier.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.080
Any special skills?
None that I've discovered.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.360
Stylax Urastaques. Charioteer.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.560
Yeah, I can whistle. I can do that
thing where you go...

03:38.880 --> 03:40.720
Used to... I used to be able to do
that.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.880
If you just put down 'mad skills'.
Mm.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.880
Oh, yeow! Did you hear that?

03:47.920 --> 03:49.920
I did, bruv. That was sick.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.560
Oh, here comes the big wig.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.880
New recruits in a line, please.

03:54.920 --> 03:59.040
Those selected for the street team
will join Tarquin and his group.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.240
Those selected for the office team
will go with Clemens.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.560
Street team. Office.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.600
Street team.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.040
Mmm... oh, no, office.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.080
Street team.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.120
Office, obviously.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.959
Street team.
Thank you.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.200
Office.
Whoa. Sorry, just a sec.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.640
What? Well, I'd prefer to be on the
street team.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.040
You're in the office.
It's the office for you.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.400
May I ask why?
You have more of a office look.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.400
And what, sorry, what look's that?

04:30.440 --> 04:34.040
To be on Street team you need to
look... How to put this? Better.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.320
What?! This guy is the dreamboat.
Give him another chance.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.720
What, at being better looking?
Yeah he can do it.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.760
Er, can I?
Do your handsome face.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.120
What's that?
Smoulder, Marcus.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.840
Yeah, is it this?
Wouldn't have thought so.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.760
Smoulder.
I'm trying to smoulder.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.120
You'll have to smoulder yourself a
smaller nose I'm afraid.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.640
Oh, come on, I'm better looking than
half this lot.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.920
Well, not Tarquin but I'm definitely
better looking than that guy.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.440
Even he'd admit that. He's an
absolute goblin.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.640
Mm, yeah, he is, actually.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.400
Stick him in the office.
Go on, then, over you go.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:18.840 --> 05:20.840
Sorry.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.120
Vote for Victor, the family man.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.480
Put the family first with Victor.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.760
Oi, ribbons!
Yeah.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.000
It's Stylax.
Got a bit of jogs, bruv.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.680
Just trying some moves to get rid of
these flyers, innit?

05:42.720 --> 05:44.720
Well, let me show you one of my
moves.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.400
Nice moves.
Yeah, it's a bit quicker, innit?

05:52.440 --> 05:55.400
Much quicker but also... quite
naughty.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.160
Oh, there's much more where that
came from, bruv.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.720
Vote for Julius Priscus.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.480
Julius Priscus for a cleaner
Aventine.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.520
All right?

06:13.560 --> 06:15.560
Vote for Julius Priscus.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.080
In't that you?
Yes, it is, yes.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.760
So why not just say 'vote for me'?

06:19.800 --> 06:22.720
Because then they won't know who to
tick on the ballot paper.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.920
Right, yeah. That's dead smart, that
is.

06:24.960 --> 06:28.600
Give us a plum, then. No, sorry, the
plums are not for slaves.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.560
I need these for genuine voters.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.480
Oh, go on, mate, give us one of
those juicy buggers. No!

06:33.520 --> 06:37.360
If you continue harassing me I'll be
forced to call the Centurion. Fine.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.400
But I'll come back, Julie.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.120
And when I do, I'm getting hold of
your plums.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.440
Welcome to my yard.
Wow, nice yard.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.640
Yes, it's my rented place.
Cool.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.960
What's with all the posters?
Oh, it's Dad's election shit.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.200
He certainly likes Victor.
Yeah, probably cos he IS Victor.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.280
No shit. Wow! I didn't expect him to
have a daughter like you.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.320
Yeah, neither did he.
Hm.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.080
So, come on, then. You gonna lips me
or what?

07:14.120 --> 07:16.120
Yeah, I...

07:18.040 --> 07:21.160
It's just... just a bit weird with
him staring at us.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.240
Better?
Yeah.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.360
Some bloody holiday this is. I'm
doing the same shit I do at work,

07:44.400 --> 07:46.720
except I'm getting death stares off a
goblin.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.720
Well, maybe stop calling him
'goblin'?

07:48.760 --> 07:51.000
And now Cynthia knows how
unattractive I am.

07:51.040 --> 07:54.520
She has seen you before. Yeah, but
now it's been officially verified.

07:54.560 --> 07:58.280
Mate, just come out with the Street
team tomorrow. Wiggy will never
notice.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.720
How was the Street team?
Bit hectic, bruv.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.920
What does that mean? It means I went
back to this girl's house

08:03.960 --> 08:06.120
and had sex in her swimming pool.
Wicked!

08:06.160 --> 08:07.840
Yeow!
Shallow end or deep end?

08:07.880 --> 08:09.560
Started off shallow, then drifted.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.160
Of course. I'm in the basement of
freaks, you're boning some random
clapper.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.800
She's not random, mate. Her name's
Ambrosia and she's Wiggy's daughter.

08:16.840 --> 08:19.760
Victor's daughter? Are you serious?
Yeah, so what?

08:19.800 --> 08:24.040
So he's all about family values and
chastity, not underwater humping.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.160
Politically this is pretty spicy.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.720
Well, my 'penoose' is politically
independent.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.560
It forms alliances with whoever it
sees fit.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.000
Although it does lean slightly to
the left.

08:34.039 --> 08:37.840
I'm just saying if Isabonus found
out, things would get 'bit hectic'.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.559
Settle, bruv. No-one's gonna find
out.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.280
That's brilliant, Marcus. Well done.

08:45.320 --> 08:48.800
So they had another look and
realised that you were handsome
after all?

08:48.840 --> 08:52.000
Yeah, basically.
His good looks aren't obvious.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.000
They take time to appreciate.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.080
Well, they've certainly passed me by.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.040
OK, Street team. Listen up.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.320
Listen up. Listen, the Street team.
The wig's trying to escape.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.480
Now, then, I'm gonna need more
applause than usual today.

09:04.520 --> 09:08.720
I'm speaking at Granary Heights, AKA
the arsehole of the Aventine.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.440
Isn't that where we live?
Yeah.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.120
The audience will be poor and
therefore sulky,

09:13.160 --> 09:15.600
which is why I need you to
compensate.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.800
I want smiles, I want sparkle.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.360
I want... Hang on, what's he doing
there?

09:20.400 --> 09:23.400
Philo? The nose is back. Why is the
nose back?

09:23.440 --> 09:25.840
I don't know, sir. Come on, out you
get, Nose.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.000
All right, yes. Will you stop
calling me 'Nose', please?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.560
You called yourself nose by having
that nose.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.400
Well, at least I don't have
roadkill on my head.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.880
How do you expect people to trust
you if you're wearing a wonky wig?

09:38.920 --> 09:41.400
What wig?
What fucking wig?

09:41.440 --> 09:43.440
There is no wig!

09:46.880 --> 09:50.080
I'm so sorry. It just came out.
Please don't hurt me.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.120
How wonky is it?

09:52.160 --> 09:54.160
A bit askew, yeah.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.120
Mr Nose - pardon me, I don't know
you're real name.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.760
Marcus. Marcus Gallow.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.040
You must have balls as big as your
nose to speak out like that.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.080
Thank you?

10:06.360 --> 10:08.480
The truth is not all this hair is
mine.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.720
The sides are and I have very
hirsute legs.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.560
I've thought to fashion some kind of
comb over,

10:14.600 --> 10:16.920
but I opted for a small toupee.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.960
My wife doesn't know.
Right. Suspect she does but...

10:20.000 --> 10:23.960
If my appendage is that obvious,
perhaps I need a new approach.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.080
Yeah. Get rid of it.
Or make sure it's always straight.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.760
Would you do that for me, Nose?

10:37.760 --> 10:39.440
Right, brief me, Philo.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.920
Well, the poor tend to like biscuits,
don't they? And fighting.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.040
So maybe if we promised them...
A biscuit fight?

10:46.080 --> 10:48.080
Yes. What is that, though?

10:49.240 --> 10:52.680
What about offering people cheaper
rents? That could go down well here.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.480
How's my hair, Nose?
Yeah, fine.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.640
There's a little flick that won't be
tamed. Tame it, Nose.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.480
I imagine it's a fight in which
biscuits are either the prize or the
weapon.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.720
Or introduce some sort of cap.
On my head?

11:03.760 --> 11:06.360
No, a cap on rent. The landlords
here are out of control.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.480
Stick to hair, Nose. Are we good to
go?

11:08.520 --> 11:11.080
And... good to go.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.520
Please don't lick me in future.
Sorry.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.520
Vote for Julius Priscus.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.720
Julius Priscus rules.
Salve, Julie.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.800
Gis a plum.
Right. Centurion!

11:24.840 --> 11:27.040
I told if you kept harassing me I'd
call them.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.720
Maybe I've summat to offer.
What? What do you mean?

11:29.760 --> 11:34.200
Maybe I have some inside info
vis-a-vis a rival

11:34.240 --> 11:37.960
which could be advantageable for
your campaign, as it were.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.920
No, thank you. I'm running a clean
campaign based on my convictions.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.240
What sort of politician do you take
me for?

11:44.280 --> 11:47.480
The sort that wanted to win. Must
have had you wrong.

11:51.320 --> 11:54.200
It's fine, Centurion. False alarm.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.880
People of Granary Heights, my name
is Victor of the Grachaee

11:59.920 --> 12:03.840
and I pledge to put family first.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.680
I know not many of you here today
are wealthy

12:09.720 --> 12:12.520
and to you I declare that if you
vote for me,

12:12.560 --> 12:15.960
you will receive three biscuits
each.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.480
Whoo!

12:20.440 --> 12:25.720
Make that four biscuits each and
some sort of biscuit-based brawl.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.680
And I pledge...

12:32.720 --> 12:36.280
..to impose a series of rent
controls

12:36.320 --> 12:39.440
to cap the price of housing at an
affordable level.

12:43.520 --> 12:47.600
I will make sure that avaricious
landlords are kept in check.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.880
And if prices do move, they're going
down, not up!

12:58.400 --> 13:00.400
Is that applause real?

13:00.440 --> 13:02.440
I think it might be.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.240
Bravo, Nose.

13:17.137 --> 13:18.977
Hey, Marcus.

13:19.063 --> 13:23.103
Saw you up there with Victor. You
were amazing. Oh, thank you.

13:23.144 --> 13:25.864
I thought your massive schnoz was
damaging his campaign.

13:25.903 --> 13:30.143
Ha! Far from it. He actually thinks
I've got a nose for politics so he's
made his wingman.

13:30.183 --> 13:32.543
Wigman.
Wing. Wingman. I'm an advisor.

13:32.583 --> 13:35.743
Ah. About that. Do you think you
could get me up there?

13:35.783 --> 13:38.823
Or at least more foreground, seeing
as you're now his wingman?

13:38.863 --> 13:41.943
Wigman. Wingman. Yeah, sure I can
conjure something up.

13:41.983 --> 13:46.343
Oh, well, maybe you can conjure up
an end to this rent cap dogshit
while you're at it.

13:46.383 --> 13:48.303
Oh, no, sorry, can't help you there.

13:48.343 --> 13:51.943
And why's that? Well, I'm just a tiny
cog in a big wheel.

13:51.983 --> 13:55.503
There are forces out there that are
bigger than both of us.

14:17.263 --> 14:22.583
Shit! Shit! Shitty shit! This is a PR
disaster!

14:22.623 --> 14:24.623
It is a little off-message.
Shit!

14:24.663 --> 14:27.183
Sir, doing that isn't great for your
hairline.

14:27.223 --> 14:29.983
What do we know about this guy?
Just that his name is Stylax.

14:30.023 --> 14:31.863
Stylax. What's that? Greek?

14:31.903 --> 14:35.063
Is he a shit-eating Greek?
And apparently he's a Charioteer.

14:35.103 --> 14:37.863
Anything else?
It says he's got mad skills.

14:37.903 --> 14:39.823
Sounds like a fucking prat.

14:39.863 --> 14:42.463
Exactly my daughter's type. What
shall we do with him?

14:42.503 --> 14:44.463
Well, the rumours can't have spread
far.

14:44.503 --> 14:47.783
If we were to disappear him now,
I doubt anyone would notice.

14:47.823 --> 14:50.863
Mm. Yeah. Good. Get it done.
What? No, no, no, don't do that.

14:50.903 --> 14:52.623
Keep your giant beak out of this.

14:52.663 --> 14:55.703
But it says he's a Charioteer so
he's probably got fans.

14:55.743 --> 14:58.863
If you disappear him you can forget
about their vote. Mmm.

14:58.903 --> 15:00.983
Good point, Nose.

15:01.023 --> 15:03.503
We're gonna have to think of
something else.

15:05.263 --> 15:07.343
You two are getting married.
Come again?

15:07.383 --> 15:10.143
Say what now? It's the only way I can
justify your actions.

15:10.183 --> 15:12.783
You are already engaged.
Are you murking me or what?

15:12.823 --> 15:16.063
Victor of the Grachaee murks no-one.
Now, if I may, sir.

15:16.103 --> 15:18.903
I get where you're coming from and
it's a very clever idea.

15:18.943 --> 15:22.583
It was Nose's idea.
And I'm sure Nose knows best,

15:22.623 --> 15:25.303
but ours was more of a casual
arrangement.

15:25.343 --> 15:29.263
What? You're telling me that you're
not in love with my daughter?

15:29.303 --> 15:31.183
Oh, keep your hair on, bruv.

15:31.223 --> 15:34.223
Ambrosia will you stop speaking in
that dreadful patois?

15:34.263 --> 15:36.743
I didn't pay 7,000 denarii a term in
school fees

15:36.783 --> 15:38.823
to have you talk like a bloody
yardie.

15:38.863 --> 15:41.663
Yeah, Dad, and I don't wanna marry
this guy. He's a waste man.

15:41.703 --> 15:44.663
He might not be.
Oh, no, no, I am a waste man.

15:44.703 --> 15:48.463
She's right. I'm lazy, I'm stupid.
I've got no prospects whatsoever.

15:48.503 --> 15:50.623
It says here that you're a
charioteer.

15:50.663 --> 15:54.423
Yeah. I may have exaggerated that.
You've got a thick head of hair.

15:54.463 --> 15:56.303
That can't harm the gene pool.

15:56.343 --> 15:59.383
I believe that follows the maternal
line. Does it? Shit.

15:59.423 --> 16:02.343
Well, I've made my mind up. You'll
be wed in the summer.

16:02.383 --> 16:05.143
And how long do we have to keep this
up for? Forever.

16:05.183 --> 16:07.103
What?! Oh, come on!

16:07.143 --> 16:10.103
It's preferable to the alternative.
That would also have been forever.

16:10.143 --> 16:14.063
Were you gonna kill him? Please just
shank him, shank him up. That's much
better.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.703
How could I marry her when she just
said that? Now, now.

16:16.743 --> 16:20.303
All couples want to shank each other
now and again, believe you me.

16:20.343 --> 16:24.223
I'm sure, over time, you'll be at
least partially happy.

16:24.263 --> 16:28.583
Now let me be the first to wish you
hearty congratulations.

16:28.623 --> 16:30.583
Congratulations.
Yay.

16:32.023 --> 16:34.583
Vote Julius Priscus for a cleaner
Aventine.

16:36.063 --> 16:39.303
So they're getting hitched in the
summer, make it look legit.

16:39.343 --> 16:41.663
Ooh, is that all you've got? Mmm...

16:41.703 --> 16:44.263
No. Also Victor wears a wig.

16:44.303 --> 16:46.103
That's common knowledge.

16:46.143 --> 16:47.663
Is it?
Yeah.

16:47.703 --> 16:50.583
Did you know he pays a bloke with a
big nose to keep it straight?

16:50.623 --> 16:54.143
What's the relevance of the nose?
Nothing, just a bit of colour.

16:54.543 --> 16:58.463
Go on. Falker... Got another
commission for you.

17:01.503 --> 17:04.183
So I thought, given her acting
experience,

17:04.223 --> 17:07.183
she could present you with flowers.
Maybe say a few words.

17:07.223 --> 17:10.863
Yes, yes, yes, fine. Just pay
attention to my crown in here, Nose.

17:10.903 --> 17:13.983
The moisture in the air can unhinge
it from its moorings.

17:14.022 --> 17:18.742
Some landlords would like a word,
sir, about this rent capped policy.

17:18.782 --> 17:21.542
What? While I'm at my ablutions?
He's at his ablutions.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.742
Their guild has always contributed
to your campaign, sir.

17:24.782 --> 17:28.343
Oh, very well.
Are we static in the attic?

17:28.383 --> 17:30.383
Yes, we are.

17:31.183 --> 17:34.863
Salve, Victor.
Salve, Landlord.

17:36.743 --> 17:38.743
Salve, Landlord.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.703
Well, I'll come straight out and say
it.

17:41.743 --> 17:44.103
We think you've forgotten who your
mates are.

17:44.143 --> 17:46.383
Is that so?
That is so.

17:46.423 --> 17:50.183
We've been very friendly to you so
that you'd be very friendly to us.

17:50.223 --> 17:52.183
If you want our help in the future,

17:52.223 --> 17:56.023
we suggest you knock this rent cap
bollocks on the... head.

17:57.543 --> 17:59.463
So, Victor...

18:01.023 --> 18:03.183
..would you kindly reconsider?

18:08.903 --> 18:10.543
Sir?
Yes, Philo.

18:11.503 --> 18:13.303
Mm?

18:13.343 --> 18:15.343
How do you wish to proceed?

18:15.383 --> 18:17.943
I think that revoking the rent cap
idea now

18:17.983 --> 18:21.583
will feel like a bit of an about
turn.

18:22.463 --> 18:24.503
Nose? What do you think?

18:24.543 --> 18:26.543
I say we stick with the caps.

18:28.263 --> 18:31.423
Is that your final decision, Victor?
Erm...

18:32.383 --> 18:35.423
Yes, yes. It is.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.503
We've got Landlord by the goolies.

18:41.543 --> 18:44.583
Once Victor gets in, our rent might
even go down. Good, eh?

18:44.623 --> 18:47.823
I won't be living here, mate. I'll be
shacked up at the wifey's yard.

18:47.863 --> 18:50.623
Shit, yeah, I forgot about that.
Nice yard, then, is it?

18:50.663 --> 18:53.463
It's fine. Very big with, like,
proper slaves. No offence.

18:53.503 --> 18:55.303
None taken.
But now we're engaged,

18:55.343 --> 18:58.183
she wants me to give up
charioteering and get a job in
finance.

18:58.223 --> 19:01.343
Victor wants me to produce an heir.
Did he say 'heir' or 'hair'?

19:01.383 --> 19:03.383
He wants a bloody grandchild, mate.

19:03.423 --> 19:05.063
I mean, how did this happen to me?

19:05.103 --> 19:08.743
It's all because I was picked for
the Street team. Curse my hot face.

19:08.783 --> 19:10.783
Victor might not get in, you know.

19:10.823 --> 19:13.463
Oh, he'll get in. We are way ahead
in the polls.

19:13.503 --> 19:17.543
Once he's visited the hospital
tomorrow and helped a few lepers,
we will walk it.

19:17.583 --> 19:20.983
We? What's all this 'we' bollocks?
You're just the wigman.

19:21.023 --> 19:23.783
Ah, but he who wields the wig wins
the...

19:27.223 --> 19:29.223
..ways.

19:34.823 --> 19:38.903
So you give Victor the flowers and
say thank you on behalf of the
hospital.

19:38.943 --> 19:42.303
Thank you on behalf of the hospital
for your unflinching support.

19:42.343 --> 19:44.543
'Thank you on behalf of the hospital'
is fine.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.703
Thank you so much, you dear man.
Stop trying to get more lines.

19:47.743 --> 19:52.743
OK, fine. Should I be compassionate,
head tilted to the side, 'how are
you feeling?' type of nurse?

19:52.783 --> 19:57.143
Or more of a strict and no nonsense,
shut your mouth and drink your
medicine?

19:57.183 --> 19:59.783
Erm, the first one.
Excellent.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.823
Thank you.
That's it, got it.

20:01.863 --> 20:04.663
No, I mean thank you, Marcus, for
giving me this break.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.623
Oh, it's nothing, really.

20:06.663 --> 20:10.383
What's the point of having this power
if you can't spread it around?

20:13.263 --> 20:15.743
There have been yet more vicious
slurs about me.

20:15.783 --> 20:18.543
Oh, no! What now?
They're saying that I wear a wig.

20:18.583 --> 20:22.263
OK. And that I hire a man with a big
nose to keep it straight.

20:22.303 --> 20:25.823
It's not that big. With that in mind,
I suggest you back off a bit.

20:26.463 --> 20:28.463
Cool.

20:28.503 --> 20:30.503
But remain within reach.

20:30.543 --> 20:34.063
So about here?
Perfect.

20:34.463 --> 20:37.783
They're ready for you now, sir.
Very good. Here we go, everyone.

20:37.823 --> 20:39.903
Happy families. Hold hands, you two.

20:39.943 --> 20:42.663
You're supposed to be engaged,
for Jove's sake.

20:57.143 --> 21:01.343
Thank you so much. It's an honour to
meet you on such an auspicious
occasion.

21:06.303 --> 21:09.023
Did you just wave at that sket?
What?

21:09.063 --> 21:11.343
No, I didn't wave at the sket. What's
a sket?

21:11.383 --> 21:14.183
That bitch back there!
I did not wave at the sket.

21:16.823 --> 21:19.223
Salve, nurse.
Salve, Victor.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.583
Aargh!

21:25.103 --> 21:27.103
All right, lads?

21:29.063 --> 21:31.063
Help me, Nose.

21:31.663 --> 21:33.663
We're slipping.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.943
Nurse! Please! Do something!

21:39.983 --> 21:42.463
I'm not a nurse, I'm an actress.

21:50.063 --> 21:53.743
It is my pleasure to introduce your
newly elected Tribune:

21:53.783 --> 21:56.103
Julius Priscus!

22:01.343 --> 22:04.663
So what's this guy like? I know him.
He's a right slippery sod.

22:04.703 --> 22:06.703
They're all the same, aren't they?

22:06.743 --> 22:09.063
Do you reckon he'll bring in the rent
caps?

22:09.103 --> 22:11.743
I somehow doubt it.

22:12.863 --> 22:14.863
Oi, Aurelius, you been paid to clap?

22:14.903 --> 22:18.023
There's a new system in place. You
get fined if you don't.

22:21.983 --> 22:23.983
Yes!
