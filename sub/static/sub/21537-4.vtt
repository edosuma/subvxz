HERE'S THE NEW ONE.

00:06.506 --> 00:07.941
- BOOM! WOW!

00:07.974 --> 00:10.343
- LUIS, IT WAS BROUGHT
TO MY ATTENTION THAT YOU POSTED

00:10.377 --> 00:12.312
SOME MISLEADING PHOTOS
OF DOWNING ONLINE.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.613
CONSIDER IT PROBATION.

[bangs wall]

00:15.015 --> 00:16.850
- LET'S DO IT?
- DO IT, MAN!

00:16.883 --> 00:18.952
BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND!

00:18.985 --> 00:20.153
I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.188
- WHOA! DID YOU GET ME A PIG?
- YEAH.

00:22.222 --> 00:23.656
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HER.
[pig squeals]

00:23.690 --> 00:24.691
- SHH. SHH.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.526
- THE ATTORNEY FOUND OUT

00:26.559 --> 00:27.927
THIS CAN ALL
BE BLOCKED OVER.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.662
- YOU'RE WRONG,
I'M TELLING YOU.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.231
CALL THE DEPARTMENT OF
BUILDINGS, CALL CITY PLANNING.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.400
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BUILDING.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.736
- YES!

00:36.770 --> 00:37.737
[gibberish]

00:37.771 --> 00:42.409
[laughs]

00:42.442 --> 00:45.612
[upbeat music]

00:45.645 --> 00:47.113
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION--

00:47.147 --> 00:50.984
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.185
- NEW YORK CITY,

00:52.218 --> 00:54.054
IT'S THE MOST EXCITING CITY
FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:54.087 --> 00:55.955
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.558
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:58.591 --> 01:01.127
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:01.161 --> 01:02.462
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

01:02.495 --> 01:03.897
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

01:03.930 --> 01:06.232
- I WANTED THIS THING MORE THAN
ANYBODY ELSE, AND YOU KNEW IT!

01:21.114 --> 01:27.087

I CANNOT DESCRIBE
HOW LOUD BABY PIGS ARE.

I DON'T WANT YOU GOING

HEY, I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT TO THE OFFICE

02:00.520 --> 02:03.056
BEFORE I GO TO MY PITCH,
SO CAN YOU PULL THE COMPS

02:03.089 --> 02:05.392
FOR PENTHOUSE B
AT PARK IMPERIAL?

02:05.425 --> 02:07.293
THAT WOULD BE A HUGE HELP,
OKAY?

02:07.327 --> 02:08.528
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

02:08.561 --> 02:11.264
YOUR BREAKFAST GOOD?

02:20.173 --> 02:22.075
[knocks on door]
- ZHANN, HOW ARE YOU?

02:22.108 --> 02:23.276
- VERY GOOD. AND YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.078
YEAH, GOOD, GOOD.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.846
UM...
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:26.880 --> 02:31.117
- WELL, UM, I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT 27 DOWNING.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.353
I KNOW, UH, YOU KNOW,
I KNOW YOU GAVE ME THE LISTING.

02:33.386 --> 02:35.188
YOU WERE EXPECTING SOMETHING
MUCH MORE FROM ME.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.691
I THOUGHT IT WAS UNSELLABLE,
AND I DID SOME THINGS

02:37.724 --> 02:40.760
TO, UM,
TO TRY TO, UH, DELIVER.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.562
BUT, UM,
BUT I HAVE SOME NEWS.

02:42.595 --> 02:44.364
- GOOD NEWS?
BAD NEWS?

02:44.397 --> 02:46.499
NOT ANOTHER MEETING
LIKE LAST TIME, I HOPE.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.302
- UH, WELL, IF, UH--
IF YOU CONSIDER

02:49.336 --> 02:51.137
GETTING AN OFFER ACCEPTED,
SIGNING CONTRACTS TOMORROW,

02:51.171 --> 02:52.639
AND CLOSING IN 30 DAYS
ARE BAD NEWS,

02:52.672 --> 02:54.641
THEN I DO HAVE [bleep]
BAD NEWS, BOOM!

02:54.674 --> 02:55.742
[laughs]

02:55.775 --> 02:57.544
- ON DOWNING STREET?
- YES, SIR.

02:57.577 --> 02:58.945
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.847
I GUESS IT'S ALL A MATTER
OF FINDING THE RIGHT BUYER

03:00.880 --> 03:03.316
AND DOING ENOUGH NOISE
TO GET PEOPLE TOGETHER

03:03.350 --> 03:05.251
AND...
[laughs]

03:05.285 --> 03:08.054
DOWNING STREET WAS ONE OF THE
MOST STRESSFUL DEALS OF MY LIFE,

03:08.054 --> 03:10.857
BUT I CALLED ABSOLUTELY
EVERY BROKER IN TOWN...

03:10.890 --> 03:12.759
HI, THIS IS LUIS ORTIZ.
WE MET AT 27 DOWNING.

03:12.792 --> 03:15.428
AND I RECRUITED ARCHITECTS
TO MAKE ME RENDERINGS

03:15.462 --> 03:18.131
TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT EVERYBODY
TO COME THROUGH THAT DOOR.

03:18.164 --> 03:19.733
I LOVE IT, MAN.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.935
AND ONCE THEY DID, IT ONLY
TAKES SOMEONE WITH MONEY

03:21.968 --> 03:24.070
AND SOMEONE WITH A VISION,

03:24.104 --> 03:25.105
AND THAT'S HOW I SOLD IT.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.373
- YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.
- YES.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.541
- YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.
- [laughs]

03:28.575 --> 03:29.809
- SO WHAT'S NEXT?
WHAT'S YOUR NEXT DEAL?

03:29.843 --> 03:31.311
- SO NEXT, I'M WORKING
ON A NEW DEVELOPMENT

03:31.344 --> 03:32.612
IN TRIBECA
ON LISPENARD STREET.

03:32.645 --> 03:34.848
- MM-HMM.
- UH, IT'S A FIVE-UNIT BUILDING.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.249
FULL-FLOOR APARTMENTS.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.485
AND, UH, I PITCH IT
TOMORROW, SO...

03:38.518 --> 03:39.619
- EXCELLENT.
- I'M VERY WELL PREPARED.

03:39.652 --> 03:40.854
I'M READY TO GO.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.555
- I DON'T WANT ANOTHER MEETING
LIKE LAST TIME.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.090
- NO.
- NO FUNNY BUSINESS.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.325
- PROMISE.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.726
- AND GET
A REAL PHOTOGRAPHER.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.961
- GET A REAL PHOTOGRAPHER.
I WILL.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.496
- YEAH.
GET OUT OF HERE.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.431
- ALL RIGHT.
BEAUTIFUL.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.767
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.301
27 DOWNING.
[laughs]

03:55.335 --> 03:57.103
- GO RING THE BELL.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.239
[bell rings]

03:59.272 --> 04:02.175
[jazz music]

04:02.208 --> 04:05.211
* *

04:05.245 --> 04:07.547
- AL, TAKE ME
TO 46 LISPENARD.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.250
I HAVE A LISTING PITCH TODAY
FOR AN ENTIRE BUILDING--

04:10.283 --> 04:13.053
46 LISPENARD
IN NORTHEAST TRIBECA.

04:13.053 --> 04:16.923
NORTHWEST TRIBECA IS CONSIDERED
TO BE THE BETTER PART.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.725
COBBLESTONED, QUIET,
TREE-LINED.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.894
BUT LISPENARD
IS STILL TRIBECA.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.195
HI.
- HEY, FREDRIK, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.396
- HOW ARE YOU? I'M FREDRIK.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.832
JONATHAN ISN'T THE OWNER
OR THE DEVELOPER,

04:25.865 --> 04:27.100
BUT HE IS
THE GENERAL MANAGER...

04:27.133 --> 04:28.401
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
WOW.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.636
- WELCOME TO OUR NEWEST PROJECT.
- GREAT.

04:29.669 --> 04:30.704
AND HE'S BEEN GIVEN THE TASK

04:30.737 --> 04:31.738
OF PICKING A BROKER.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.540
[high-pitched]
ME.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.442
- PLEASE WEAR THESE BOOTIES.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.444
[whimsical music]

04:37.477 --> 04:39.079
- CAN YOU HOLD THIS?
- WE'RE VERY NEAT.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.082
- WHAT SIZE ARE THESE?
8? I'M A 12.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.616
OOH.
- THERE WE GO.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.086
- OH, I THINK THE COMMISSION
JUST WENT UP.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.355
[upbeat music]

04:48.388 --> 04:50.657
IT WOULD BE AMAZING
TO GET A BUILDING LIKE THIS.

04:50.690 --> 04:54.194
THERE ARE 11 UNITS.
SAME PRICE, SAME SIZE,

04:54.227 --> 04:55.662
MIRROR IMAGES OF EACH OTHER,
REALLY.

04:55.695 --> 04:58.098
WOW, THE CEILINGS HERE
ARE TRULY AMAZING.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.099
- YEAH, THROUGHOUT.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.333
- IT WAS A--
WHAT WAS IT BEFORE?

05:00.367 --> 05:01.468
- IT WAS
A COMMERCIAL BUILDING.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.069
WE BOUGHT IT
SEVEN YEARS AGO,

05:03.103 --> 05:04.404
AND THE CONVERSION PROCESS
TO GET RESIDENTIAL

05:04.437 --> 05:05.572
TOOK A LONG TIME.

05:05.605 --> 05:06.673
- OKAY.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.141
THIS IS THE MODEL HOME,
WHICH IS STAGED,

05:08.174 --> 05:10.744
AND JONATHAN USES IT
TO SHOWCASE THE BUILDING,

05:10.777 --> 05:12.145
AND IT'S STUNNING.

05:12.178 --> 05:13.446
* *

05:13.480 --> 05:14.814
OKAY, SO MAYBE
LET'S SIT DOWN AND TALK.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.783
- SURE.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.152
- SO, YOU HAVE 11 UNITS.
- 11 UNITS.

05:19.185 --> 05:20.820
- THAT YOU'RE LOOKING
TO SELL.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.756
AND THIS IS THE TYPICAL UNIT
IN THE BUILDING,

05:22.789 --> 05:23.757
THE MODEL HOME.

05:23.790 --> 05:24.858
- MM-HMM.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.292
- WHAT TIMEFRAME
ARE YOU THINKING OF HERE?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.428
- HOW LONG WERE YOU THINKING?
- WELL, YOU KNOW, 11 UNITS.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.430
WE USUALLY SIGN SALES
AND MARKETING AGREEMENTS

05:30.463 --> 05:31.664
FOR 12 MONTHS.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.767
- YEAH, WE'RE NOT
GONNA DO 12 MONTHS.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.069
WE WERE THINKING MORE ALONG
THE LINES OF THREE MONTHS.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.205
[dramatic music]

05:39.239 --> 05:40.507
- THREE MONTHS?

05:40.540 --> 05:41.741
YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT
A REGULAR LISTING AGREEMENT

05:41.775 --> 05:43.076
FOR ONE APARTMENT
IS SIX MONTHS, STANDARD.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.411
- YEAH.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.746
- BUT YOU WANT ME TO SELL
11 UNITS IN THREE MONTHS.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.314
- YEAH.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.849
- THE LAST THING THAT
I WANT TO DO IS TAKE ON

05:49.883 --> 05:52.419
YET ANOTHER PROJECT
WITH A TIGHT DEADLINE,

05:52.452 --> 05:55.088
BECAUSE TIMING WAS THE REASON
I WAS SO STRESSED

05:55.088 --> 05:57.490
AND PUSHED TO THE MAX
WITH THE MARBLE HOUSE.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.893
- HOW ABOUT 17,500,000
IN 30 DAYS?

05:59.926 --> 06:01.027
- OKAY.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.195
- WE REALLY NEED TO LOWER
THE PRICE.

06:02.228 --> 06:03.763
- I SPENT $40,000.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.099
IF I DON'T SELL THIS, I'M NOT
GONNA GET THAT MONEY BACK.

06:06.132 --> 06:08.702
BUT IN THIS BUSINESS,
YOU HAVE TO BE CONFIDENT.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.837
YOU HAVE TO FEEL
LIKE YOU CAN GET IT DONE

06:10.870 --> 06:12.339
NO MATTER WHAT.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.708
THE ONLY WAY THAT
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THIS...

06:14.741 --> 06:16.710
- MM-HMM.
- AND LISTEN UP NOW--

06:16.743 --> 06:20.714
IS TO HAVE A REAL BIG PUSH
INTO THE MARKETPLACE.

06:20.747 --> 06:24.084
A BIG OPEN HOUSE, LOTS OF PEOPLE
BIDDING FOR THE SAME UNITS.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.720
YOU KNOW, MOMENTUM IS LIKE
A WAVE OF INTEREST,

06:26.753 --> 06:28.488
AND WHEN YOU HAVE THAT WAVE,
IT'S A REALLY BEAUTIFUL THING,

06:28.521 --> 06:30.156
BUT THEN,
WHEN THE WAVE IS GONE,

06:30.190 --> 06:31.458
IT'S VERY HARD TO RECREATE,

06:31.491 --> 06:32.759
SO YOU'VE GOT TO GO ALL OUT

06:32.792 --> 06:34.427
AND TRY TO SELL THEM
ALL AT ONCE.

06:34.461 --> 06:35.762
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.197
LET'S TALK ABOUT PRICING
FOR A SECOND,

06:37.230 --> 06:38.398
'CAUSE IT'S ALL RELATED.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.767
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE IN
A GOOD PART OF TRIBECA,

06:40.800 --> 06:42.268
BUT NOT THE BEST.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.305
I WOULD PRICE THIS
AT 2,600,000.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.474
- UH, NO.
2,600,000 IS TOO LOW.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.809
WE'RE LOOKING FOR MORE
THE 2,950,000 AREA.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.611
- 2,950,000?
- MM-HMM.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.446
- YOU WANT MORE THAN 1,500
A SQUARE FOOT?

06:53.480 --> 06:54.481
- YEAH.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.715
- BUT EVERYTHING
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

06:55.749 --> 06:57.283
SELLS FOR $1,000 A FOOT.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.351
- MM-HMM.

06:58.385 --> 07:01.354
- OOH.
UM...

07:01.388 --> 07:04.057
- WE THINK THAT
IT'S A UNIQUE PROPERTY.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.191
- I'VE HEARD THAT ONE
BEFORE.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.794
- I'M SURE YOU HAVE.

07:07.827 --> 07:12.298
- UM...
2,650,000?

07:12.332 --> 07:13.533
- MM-MM.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.535
- YOU WANT ME TO OVERPRICE

07:15.568 --> 07:17.203
AND SELL OUT
IN THREE MONTHS.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.239
YOU--YOU DO UNDERSTAND
THAT'S AN IMPOSSIBILITY?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.408
- IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.678
- UM...

07:24.711 --> 07:28.815
OKAY, 2,750,000, MY LAST--
THAT'S THE LAST PRICE--

07:28.848 --> 07:31.651
THE HIGHEST PRICE
I CAN GIVE YOU.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.788
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

07:34.821 --> 07:35.955
- FULL ASK.

07:36.056 --> 07:40.493
- OKAY. 11 UNITS.
THAT'S $30 MILLION,

07:40.527 --> 07:44.230
WHICH IS $750,000
IN COMMISSION.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.066
CHING-CHING!

07:46.066 --> 07:47.901
WE'LL SELL OUT THE BUILDING
IN THREE MONTHS.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.436
- GOOD.
- WEARING BOOTIES.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.670
HEY, CAN I TAKE THEM OFF,
BY THE WAY?

07:50.704 --> 07:53.740
- NOT YET. NOT UNTIL
WE GET TO THE ELEVATOR.

[doorbell rings]

08:03.049 --> 08:04.217
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. RYAN SERHANT.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.285
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- RYAN, NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.286
THANKS FOR COMING.
- ABSOLUTELY.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.520
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.022
THE PARK IMPERIAL

08:09.055 --> 08:10.123
IS A HIGH-RISE
CONDOMINIUM BUILDING

08:10.156 --> 08:13.460
ON 56TH AND BROADWAY
IN MIDTOWN WEST,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.261
JUST BELOW CENTRAL PARK.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.130
AND AFTER MY SUCCESS
IN SELLING PENTHOUSE "A"...

08:17.163 --> 08:18.131
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BRINGING ME THROUGH.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.532
- ABSOLUTELY.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.868
- THE SELLER OF PENTHOUSE "B"
WANTS ME TO SELL HIS TOO.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.470
NATURALLY.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.771
THIS IS INSANE.

08:24.804 --> 08:27.640
[upbeat music]

08:27.674 --> 08:33.313

08:33.346 --> 08:37.584
- WE RECENTLY COMPLETED ABOUT
A $1 1/2 MILLION RENOVATION,

08:37.617 --> 08:38.785
AND WE'VE REALLY
OPENED IT UP.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.588
WE TOTALLY RENOVATED
THE KITCHEN.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.189
THE COUNTERTOPS--
THE CUSTOM COUNTER WORK

08:43.223 --> 08:44.824
WITH THIS RICH WALNUT--
I MEAN,

08:44.858 --> 08:47.360
WE REALLY DID A LOT
OF HIGH-END WORK.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.928
- PAT AND HIS COUSIN TERRY

08:48.962 --> 08:50.930
BOUGHT THE APARTMENT
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO

08:50.964 --> 08:52.098
WHEN THE BUILDING
FIRST OPENED,

08:52.132 --> 08:54.768
AND THEY RENOVATED IT
PRISTINELY

08:54.801 --> 08:56.503
AND HAVE USED IT AS
A PIED-A-TERRE,

08:56.536 --> 08:58.071
KIND OF NEW YORK CITY
CRASH PAD.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.339
NOW THEY WANT TO SELL IT,

08:59.372 --> 09:01.107
BECAUSE THEY SEE HOW MUCH
IT'S APPRECIATED

09:01.141 --> 09:03.677
AND THE PRICE THAT I WAS ABLE
TO GET FOR PENTHOUSE "A."

09:03.710 --> 09:06.246
- THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE BUYING.
- WOW.

09:06.279 --> 09:10.016
IT LOOKS VERY--YOU KNOW,
LIKE I DON'T WANT TO, LIKE,

09:10.016 --> 09:11.317
MESS IT UP AT ALL.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.353
- WELL, YEAH,
THAT'S ANOTHER THING

09:13.386 --> 09:14.521
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.889
D-DON'T BE PICKING
AND TOUCHING THINGS,

09:15.922 --> 09:17.357
BECAUSE WE'RE--YOU KNOW,

09:17.390 --> 09:20.160
THIS IS
A VERY PRISTINE PLACE,

09:20.193 --> 09:21.661
AND WHEN YOU
GO TO SHOW THIS,

09:21.695 --> 09:23.029
I DON'T WANT
A LOT OF SHOWS.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.764
NO OPEN HOUSES.
- NO OPEN HOUSES?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.132
- NO OPEN HOUSES,
NO PARTIES.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.667
- NO PARTIES?
- NO RECEPTION.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.136
- WAIT.
NO OPEN HOUSES?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.038
[groans]

09:32.072 --> 09:33.740
- I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU
TO SHOW IT TO ANYBODY

09:33.773 --> 09:35.475
UNTIL THEY'RE
VERY PREQUALIFIED.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.610
- OKAY.
- NOBODY USING THE BATHROOM.

09:37.644 --> 09:39.112
NOBODY FLUSHING THE TOILET.
- OKAY.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.947
- NOBODY EATING OUT
OF MY 'FRIGERATOR.

09:41.047 --> 09:41.948
- RIGHT.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.050
- LIST IT, QUALIFY,
GET IT SOLD.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.719
- GOT IT. I CAN DO THAT.
- OKAY.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.253
WELL, LET'S GO TALK
ABOUT IT.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.823
- SO, TYPICALLY,
YOU HAVE AN APARTMENT.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.092
WE GET IT PHOTOGRAPHED,
AND THEN DO, LIKE,

09:52.125 --> 09:53.393
A BROKERS' OPEN ON FRIDAY.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.495
- [sighs]

09:55.528 --> 09:57.630
YOU WANT TO COME IN AND TAKE
A COUPLE OF PHOTOGRAPHS,

09:57.664 --> 09:58.631
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.367
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.836
- WHAT ABOUT A SMALL VIDEO?

10:02.869 --> 10:04.204
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING
TO BE BRINGING

10:04.237 --> 10:06.106
EVERY SINGLE BROKER
THROUGH HERE.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.275
- FINE, JUST A SHORT VIDEO,
A LITTLE BIT ON THE VIEWS,

10:09.309 --> 10:12.112
A LITTLE BIT OF THE LIVING ROOM
AND THE MASTER BEDROOM.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.214
- AND THAT WOULD JUST ALLOW ME
TO THEN SHOW THE APARTMENT

10:14.247 --> 10:16.316
AND SHOW IT
FOR HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS...

10:16.349 --> 10:17.650
- WITHOUT HAVING--

10:17.684 --> 10:18.752
- WITHOUT HAVING TO BRING
ALL THESE PEOPLE THROUGH.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.020
- I'M FINE WITH THAT.
- OKAY.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.388
SO...
- LET'S TALK ABOUT PRICE.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.389
- SURE.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.424
- YOU KNOW, YOU GOT

10:24.457 --> 10:26.259
A PRICE FOR AN APARTMENT
THAT I KNOW

10:26.292 --> 10:29.496
DOESN'T HAVE NEAR THE AMENITIES
THAT I HAVE HERE.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.364
- WE GOT $7,750,000
FOR THE ONE NEXT DOOR,

10:31.398 --> 10:32.632
AND IT SAT ON THE MARKET
FOR TWO YEARS.

10:32.665 --> 10:33.633
- RIGHT.
- RIGHT?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.635
THIS APARTMENT
IS BEAUTIFUL,

10:35.669 --> 10:37.404
BUT IT DOES SIT IN THE BACK
OF THE BUILDING.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.105
- I DON'T WANT
TO CUT YOU OFF, RYAN.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.473
- OKAY.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.275
- BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA TALK TO ME
ABOUT COMPS AND PRICING

10:42.308 --> 10:44.277
BECAUSE YOU GOT $7.7 MILLION
FOR THAT,

10:44.310 --> 10:46.413
THAT YOU WANT TO LIST THIS
BELOW THAT,

10:46.446 --> 10:47.947
THE MEETING'S OVER.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.083
THAT'S JUST NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.285
- PENTHOUSE "A"
AND PENTHOUSE "B"

10:52.318 --> 10:55.488
ARE EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE,
BUT GUESS WHAT?

10:55.522 --> 10:57.657
THIS APARTMENT WON'T GET
THE SAME KIND OF PRICE

10:57.691 --> 11:00.260
THAT PENTHOUSE "A" GOT,
BECAUSE IN PENTHOUSE "A,"

11:00.293 --> 11:02.162
EVERY ROOM
FACED CENTRAL PARK.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.064
AND IN PENTHOUSE "B,"

11:04.064 --> 11:08.234
ONLY ONE PANE OF GLASS IN
THE LIVING ROOM FACES THE PARK,

11:08.268 --> 11:09.469
AND PARK VIEWS
ARE MORE EXPENSIVE.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.071
SO, WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?

11:11.104 --> 11:13.440
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
LIST IT AT 7,900,000

11:13.473 --> 11:15.075
AND SEE WHAT KIND OF BITES
YOU GET,

11:15.108 --> 11:17.744
AND IF WE NEED TO DROP
THE PRICE A LITTLE BIT,

11:17.777 --> 11:23.116
MAYBE I'LL COME DOWN
TO 7,800,000, 7,795,000.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.984
- MM-HMM.
- I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.820
- WHY DON'T WE DO THIS?

11:26.853 --> 11:28.855
ARE YOU WILLING TO SELL IT
WITH THE FURNITURE?

11:28.888 --> 11:30.490
IS THAT A POSSIBILITY?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.726
- WE WERE THINKING MAYBE--
MAYBE SOME OF THE FURNITURE.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.427
NOT--THE ARTWORK'S
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.263
- SO, WHY DON'T WE PRICE IT
A LITTLE BIT LOWER

11:37.297 --> 11:39.399
THAN WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

11:39.432 --> 11:40.700
AND THEN, IF SOMEONE
WANTS TO COME IN,

11:40.734 --> 11:42.369
AND THEY WANT THE FURNITURE
OR THEY WANT THIS,

11:42.402 --> 11:45.372
THEY WANT THAT, THEN WE START
TACKING ALL THAT ON.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.107
THAT WAY, WE'RE GONNA
GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR,

11:47.107 --> 11:49.542
AND THAT'S WHAT
WE WANT TO DO.

11:49.576 --> 11:52.278
OTHERWISE--OTHERWISE, WHY
ARE YOU MEETING WITH ME, RIGHT?

11:52.312 --> 11:53.813
- OKAY, WELL, WITHOUT
THE ARTWORK, THEN,

11:53.847 --> 11:59.452
AND WITHOUT ANY FURNITURE,
HOW ABOUT 7,699,000?

11:59.486 --> 12:03.223
- LET'S DO 7,695,000.
- OKAY.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.224
- DOES THAT WORK?
- YOU HAVE A DEAL.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.059
- OKAY.

12:06.059 --> 12:10.296
7.695 MILLION IS A VERY HIGH
PRICE FOR THIS APARTMENT.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.533
THAT COMES TO ABOUT
$4,200 A FOOT OR SO,

12:13.566 --> 12:14.968
WHEN THE REAL MARKET VALUE
IS CLOSER

12:15.068 --> 12:17.737
TO ABOUT $3,000
OR $3,500 A FOOT.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.272
I HAVE MY WORK
CUT OUT FOR ME.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.274
- PERFORM!

12:21.307 --> 12:22.876
- I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
THE CREDENTIALS,

12:22.909 --> 12:24.144
BUT I UNDERSTAND
THE MARKET VERY WELL.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.412
I UNDERSTAND TRIBECA.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.180
I WANT THIS MORE
THAN I HAVE EVER WANTED

12:27.213 --> 12:28.748
ANYTHING IN MY CAREER,

12:28.782 --> 12:30.517
AND NOW IS MY TIME
TO GET IT.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.431
- THERE IS A LOT
OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS

12:44.464 --> 12:46.266
COMING UP
IN NEW YORK CITY.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.301
IN TRIBECA, THERE ARE TWO
THAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT

12:48.335 --> 12:50.704
FOR QUITE SOME TIME--
46 LISPENARD, AND THEN,

12:50.737 --> 12:52.238
RIGHT NEXT DOOR
IS 50 LISPENARD,

12:52.272 --> 12:54.641
WHICH IS THE ONE
THAT I'M PITCHING RIGHT NOW,

12:54.674 --> 12:55.742
AND I LOVE 50 LISPENARD.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.877
I WANT THIS
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

12:57.911 --> 12:58.945
I'VE WANTED THIS BUILDING

12:58.978 --> 13:00.814
SINCE I FIRST SAW IT
BEING RENOVATED.

13:00.847 --> 13:01.848
MR. JASMIT.
- HEY.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.717
- HOW ARE YOU?
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

13:03.750 --> 13:04.851
MY COLLEAGUE,
WHO KNOWS JASMIT VERY WELL,

13:04.884 --> 13:07.053
ARRANGED FOR US TO MEET.

13:07.053 --> 13:10.190
SO, I'VE HEARD AMAZING THINGS
ABOUT THIS BUILDING.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.358
I'M YOUR GUY TO, UH,

13:11.391 --> 13:13.526
TO, UH, TAKE THIS THING
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.762
- SO LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.
- AFTER YOU.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.432
THIS BUILDING IS AMAZING.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.134
THERE ARE FOUR
IDENTICAL APARTMENTS,

13:21.167 --> 13:24.404
AND THEN THERE IS THIS
AMAZING PENTHOUSE ON TOP

13:24.437 --> 13:26.539
THAT HAS TWO FLOORS
AND IS MORE EXPENSIVE.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.576
- THIS IS MY SECOND FLOOR.
- WOW.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.779
THE LOWER UNITS ARE PRICED
FROM 2.8 MILLION TO 3 MILLION,

13:32.812 --> 13:36.716
BASED ON THE VIEW,
WHICH IS ABOUT $1,400 A FOOT.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.785
THAT IS VERY AMBITIOUS
FOR THE AREA,

13:38.818 --> 13:41.454
ESPECIALLY FOR AN UP-AND-COMING
STREET LIKE LISPENARD STREET.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.156
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
MAKING SOMETHING SO AMAZING.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.091
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.327
THE UNITS ARE NOT STAGED,
BUT THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.462
THEY HAVE ALL
THE ORIGINAL DETAILS.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.131
THEY HAVE
THE EXPOSED BRICK WALLS

13:51.164 --> 13:53.566
AND VERY, VERY HIGH
CEILINGS.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.102
I WANT THIS MORE THAN
I HAVE EVER WANTED ANYTHING

13:56.102 --> 13:57.404
IN MY CAREER,

13:57.437 --> 13:59.239
AND NOW IS MY TIME
TO GET IT.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.373
- TELL ME FIRST.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.509
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.344
HAVE YOU EVER SOLD
ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT?

14:04.377 --> 14:07.380
ARE YOU SOMEBODY
WHO I SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER?

14:07.414 --> 14:11.751
- IT'S TRUE,
I HAVEN'T DONE DEVELOPMENTS,

14:11.785 --> 14:12.852
BUT I UNDERSTAND
THE MARKET VERY WELL.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.287
I UNDERSTAND TRIBECA.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.422
- RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW
WHERE THE MARKET IS.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.956
IT'S--IT'S VERY TOUGH
RIGHT NOW.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.124
IT'S NOT A JOKE.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.094
- I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
THE CREDENTIALS,

14:21.127 --> 14:24.831
BUT I HAVE THE CLIENTS,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.433
I AM SURE THAT
YOU ARE INTERVIEWING

14:26.466 --> 14:28.234
EVERY SINGLE BROKER
IN TOWN.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.736
- ABSOLUTELY.

14:29.769 --> 14:30.837
- MAYBE ACTUALLY
THEY HAVE NUMBERS

14:30.870 --> 14:32.305
THAT I CAN'T COMPETE
MYSELF WITH,

14:32.339 --> 14:33.907
BUT THIS IS THE ONLY THING
THAT I'M ONLY FOCUSING ABOUT.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.342
WE ALL HAVE TO START
FROM SOMEWHERE.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.911
IF I TAKE THIS DEVELOPMENT,
THIS IS NOW MY TOP PRIORITY.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.079
THIS IS MY<i>ONLY</i>PRIORITY.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.947
I WILL BE HERE
DAY AND NIGHT.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.215
IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO SHOW
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING

14:42.248 --> 14:43.450
BECAUSE THEY JUST LANDED

14:43.483 --> 14:46.119
FROM A FLIGHT
IN SAN FRANCISCO, I'M HERE.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.221
ONLY MYSELF.

14:48.254 --> 14:49.556
THERE IS NOBODY
IN THIS INDUSTRY

14:49.589 --> 14:50.623
THAT IS HUNGRIER
THAN I AM,

14:50.657 --> 14:53.760
AND THERE WILL NEVER BE.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.098
- THAT'S THE PERSON
I'M LOOKING FOR.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.300
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A VERY HARD DECISION,

15:00.333 --> 15:02.168
BUT I'M GONNA DO
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

15:02.202 --> 15:05.638
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE WEEK,
AND THAT MEANS STARTING TODAY.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.742
YOU HAVE ONE WEEK
TO SELL ONE UNIT.

15:08.775 --> 15:13.046
YOU SELL ONE UNIT,
YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE BUILDING.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.482
NO CONTRACT SIGNED,
NO NOTHING.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.483
ONE WEEK.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.084
- OKAY.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.119
- CAN YOU DELIVER?
- ABSOLUTELY.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.488
- ARE YOU SURE?
- I AM POSITIVE.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.089
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.526
I HAVE ONE WEEK
TO FIND ONE BUYER.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.894
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT BUYER IS OUT THERE,

15:27.927 --> 15:30.563
AND I'M ONLY THINKING
OF GETTING HIM THAT BUYER

15:30.597 --> 15:32.532
LIKE IF IT WAS
THE LAST DAY OF MY LIFE.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.801
BOOM!

15:46.179 --> 15:48.348
- [humming]
SIGN-IN SHEETS.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.216
DOING AN OPEN HOUSE
FOR AN ENTIRE BUILDING

15:50.250 --> 15:52.118
IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT
THAN DOING AN OPEN HOUSE

15:52.152 --> 15:53.653
FOR ONE APARTMENT.

15:53.687 --> 15:55.388
FACADE PHOTO.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.523
BUT MY STRATEGY TODAY

15:56.556 --> 15:58.124
IS TO PROVE MYSELF
HERE IN THE MODEL HOME

15:58.158 --> 15:59.626
AND MEET AND GREET PEOPLE...

15:59.659 --> 16:00.627
OKAY.
YOU GUYS ARE READY?

16:00.660 --> 16:02.395
WHILE I UTILIZE MY TEAM

16:02.429 --> 16:03.930
TO SHOW THE OTHER FLOORS.

16:04.030 --> 16:07.033
OH, MY GOD, SO MANY PEOPLE.
HELLO, GUYS.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.201
HI.
- GOOD MORNING.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.136
- HI. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.838
HI. I'M FREDRIK.
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.640
HI, GUYS.
THANKS FOR COMING.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.175
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
I LIKE THIS COLOR ON YOU.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.743
IT LOOKS GOOD.
AND THIS COLOR ON YOU.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.079
AND THIS COLOR ON ME.
WHOO!

16:19.112 --> 16:22.716
OKAY, YOU NEED TO SIGN IN.
EVERYBODY SIGN IN HERE.

16:22.749 --> 16:23.783
AND YOU CAN TAKE
A FLOOR PLAN EACH.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.218
WE HAVE 11 APARTMENTS.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.754
THE WIDTH HERE, OF THIS
LIVING ROOM, IS INCREDIBLE.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.055
FOUR CLOSETS IN HERE.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.057
THE FIVE-PIECE MASTER BATH.
FEEL FREE TO LOOK.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.826
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
BIGGER WINDOWS THAN THIS?

16:32.859 --> 16:35.095
- I'D LIKE TO SEE THE LIGHT ON
A HIGHER FLOOR IN THE BEDROOM.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.297
- OKAY, SO, MAYBE SARAH,
CAN YOU TAKE HER?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.965
- SURE.

16:39.065 --> 16:40.200
- THERE'S
A CONSCIOUS DECISION

16:40.233 --> 16:41.501
TO HAVE A LOT OF BROKERS
AT THE SAME TIME.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.936
IT CREATES URGENCY.

16:42.969 --> 16:46.406
COME IN, EVERYONE.
OH, JONATHAN.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.376
- HI.
WHERE ARE YOUR BOOTIES?

16:49.409 --> 16:51.277
EVERYONE
HAS TO WEAR BOOTIES.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.714
- OH, OKAY. UM...

16:54.748 --> 16:56.483
OH, JONATHAN, OF COURSE,

16:56.516 --> 16:58.952
YOU'RE SHOWING UP
TO MY BROKERS' OPEN.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.521
GUYS, I'M SORRY.
UH...

17:01.554 --> 17:02.789
IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME
HAND THESE OUT.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.392
- SURE.
- YOU NEED TO WEAR BOOTIES.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.560
NO, NO, NO, YOU NEED
TO WEAR BOOTIES.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.863
I MEAN,
THESE ARE FANCY BROKERS.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.464
UPPER EAST SIDE,
UPPER WEST SIDE.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.067
- NO EXCEPTIONS.
- BUT SHE HAS HIGH HEELS.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.169
IT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT
WHEN THESE BROKERS

17:16.202 --> 17:18.038
ARE ON ONE LEG,
LIKE, WAH, WAH,

17:18.071 --> 17:21.408
LIKE SOME EXOTIC BIRD,
LOSING BALANCE WITH BOOTIES.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.943
MY SUIT IS TOO TIGHT
FOR THIS.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.045
BOOTIES.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.149
A WOOD-BURNING FIREPLACE,
WORKING.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.684
DO YOU LOVE THE FLOORS?
- LOVE THEM.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.585
- I'M CLEANING THE FLOORS
AS I'M GOING.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.055
- [laughs]

17:35.088 --> 17:36.756
- SO, DO YOU HAVE A BUYER?
- POSSIBLY.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.425
[laughs]
- YOU DO?

17:38.458 --> 17:40.427
- WINDOWS ARE BEAUTIFUL.
THE LIGHT IS GREAT.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.562
- I LIKE THE OAK WOOD FLOORS.
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.197
- I HAVE A BUYER.
- FOR WHICH UNIT?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.932
ALL OF THEM?
- [laughs]

17:45.965 --> 17:47.634
- I'VE GOT TO SAY,
DESPITE THE BOOTIES,

17:47.667 --> 17:50.637
IT WAS A BIG SUCCESS.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.574
[funky music]

17:54.607 --> 17:57.277
* *

17:57.310 --> 17:59.579
- THIS GUY, HE'S, LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW,

17:59.612 --> 18:01.047
HE WAS IN THE MARINES
OR SOMETHING,

18:01.081 --> 18:02.449
AND HE'S LIKE, "I WANT YOU
TO SELL THIS APARTMENT.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.683
"I WANT YOU
TO SELL IT TOMORROW,

18:03.717 --> 18:05.018
"BUT YOU CAN'T BRING
ANY PEOPLE IN HERE.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.186
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.
DON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT."

18:06.219 --> 18:08.722
PAT, THE OWNER
OF PENTHOUSE "B,"

18:08.755 --> 18:11.725
SAID THAT I COULD DO A LISTING
VIDEO IN THE APARTMENT.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.792
WHERE IS THIS PLACE?
WHERE ARE WE?

18:12.826 --> 18:14.027
- RIGHT HERE.
RIGHT ON THE RIGHT.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.895
- LISTING VIDEOS
ABOUT APARTMENTS

18:15.929 --> 18:18.031
ARE SO, SO BORING.

18:18.031 --> 18:20.166
MAYBE--MAYBE A COUPLE PEOPLE
WILL WATCH THEM.

18:20.200 --> 18:24.070
SO, I CAME UP WITH
THE GENIUS, GENIUS IDEA

18:24.104 --> 18:25.872
TO DO A MUSIC VIDEO.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.474
- THIS'LL BE GREAT.
YOU KNOW, MARY'S PRETTY COOL.

18:27.507 --> 18:31.177
- MY CO-WORKER NICK
THINKS HE HAS THIS GREAT BAND

18:31.211 --> 18:34.180
THAT HE KNOWS THAT WOULD
SHOWCASE THE SPACE.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.248
AM I OVERDRESSED?

18:35.281 --> 18:36.850
- A LITTLE BIT,
BUT YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

18:36.883 --> 18:37.884
- THANK YOU.
[laughter]

18:37.917 --> 18:40.286
[overlapping chatter]

18:40.320 --> 18:42.188
[live music]

18:42.222 --> 18:44.124
- BREAKDOWN, BREAKDOWN,
HERE WE GO.

18:44.157 --> 18:45.358
COME ON, LADIES.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.260
* WON'T YOU COME DOWN
AND SAVE ME *

18:47.293 --> 18:49.229
* IN A LITTLE BIT? *

18:49.262 --> 18:50.230
* DID YOU HEAR IT? *

18:50.263 --> 18:51.831
* COME BACK
AND RESCUE ME *

18:51.865 --> 18:55.235
* OH, IT'S AMAZING *

18:55.268 --> 18:56.703
* I THINK YOU MIGHT'VE *

18:56.736 --> 18:58.538
* I THINK
YOU MIGHT'VE *

18:58.571 --> 19:00.373
* I THINK YOU MIGHT'VE *

19:00.407 --> 19:02.609
* COME ON, COME ON,
OH OH OH *

19:02.642 --> 19:04.377
[cheers and applause]

19:04.411 --> 19:06.780
- MARY C IS INCREDIBLE.

19:06.813 --> 19:10.784
DOING A MUSIC VIDEO
IS THE BESTEST IDEA.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.353
- MARY.
- HI, HON, HOW ARE YOU?

19:13.386 --> 19:14.654
- HI. MWAH!
- THANK YOU FOR COMING DOWN.

19:14.688 --> 19:16.322
WHO DO YOU HAVE THERE?
- I HAVE RYAN.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.323
- HI.
- LET ME INTRODUCE YOU.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.625
- RYAN.
- THIS IS RYAN SERHANT.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.193
- HI. MARY. NICE TO MEET YOU.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.428
THAT WAS AWESOME.
- THANK YOU.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.529
- SO, SO, SO GOOD.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.064
- WE WERE TALKING.

19:24.097 --> 19:25.231
SO YOU NEED A SICK PLACE
TO DO A VIDEO.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.366
- WE NEED--
THIS IS THE THING.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.467
WE'RE SHOOTING A VIDEO

19:27.500 --> 19:29.302
FOR OUR SECOND SINGLE,
<i>LOVE AUTOMATIC.</i>

19:29.336 --> 19:30.303
- OKAY.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.404
- AND WE WANT TO SHOWCASE

19:31.438 --> 19:32.706
AS MUCH OF NEW YORK CITY
AS POSSIBLE

19:32.739 --> 19:34.140
WITH SOME KIND OF COOL VIEW.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.141
- SURE.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.142
- DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING

19:36.176 --> 19:37.610
THAT YOU THINK WILL WORK,
OR--?

19:37.644 --> 19:39.045
- UH, LIKE THE COOLEST
APARTMENT EVER.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.313
LIKE,
FLOOR-TO-CEILING GLASS.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.881
ALL YOU SEE IS CENTRAL PARK.
- THAT'S AMAZING.

19:41.915 --> 19:42.949
- BUT IT'S GOT
360-DEGREE VIEWS,

19:43.049 --> 19:44.317
SO WHEN YOU GO
TO THE MASTER BEDROOM,

19:44.351 --> 19:46.086
YOU'RE LOOKING OUT
ALL ACROSS THE CITY.

19:46.119 --> 19:47.287
MORNING TO NIGHT,
IT'S THE COOLEST THING.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.288
- IT'S THE NEATEST APARTMENT,
ACTUALLY.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.723
- THAT SOUNDS AMAZING.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.724
- LET'S DO IT.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.058
I KNOW THIS IDEA
IS TOTALLY CRAZY,

19:52.058 --> 19:54.494
AND I'M SO NERVOUS
ABOUT IT,

19:54.527 --> 19:56.830
BUT BY THE TIME
PAT FINDS OUT,

19:56.863 --> 19:58.531
I'LL HAVE A BUYER,
HOPEFULLY,

19:58.565 --> 20:02.168
AND HE WON'T KILL ME,
HOPEFULLY.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.236
AWESOME.
- THAT'S IT.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.672
- NICE.
- ROCK OUT.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.907
- WHAT IS YOUR COUNTER-OFFER?
- THERE'S NO NEGOTIATION.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.542
- THAT'S FULL ASK.
- I KNOW IT'S FULL ASK.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.044
IT'S THE ONLY--
ONLY THING WE'RE TAKING.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.278
- [groans]

20:20.220 --> 20:22.088
- HAVING AN OPEN HOUSE AT
50 LISPENARD IS NOT AN OPTION

20:22.122 --> 20:25.025
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SIGNED
AN EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT YET,

20:25.058 --> 20:27.761
SO I CAN ONLY DO NOW PRIVATE
AND OFF-MARKET SHOWINGS

20:27.794 --> 20:30.263
WITHIN MY CONTACTS,
AND I ONLY HAVE ONE WEEK,

20:30.296 --> 20:32.332
SO I HAVE TO THINK
OUTSIDE THE BOX.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.168
TO SELL THIS UNIT,
I NEED TO USE ALL MY RESOURCES,

20:35.201 --> 20:37.437
AND WHAT A BETTER RESOURCE
THAN MY COMPANY?

20:37.470 --> 20:39.873
SO, I CALLED UP A MEETING
WITH EVERYBODY IN THE AGENCY,

20:39.906 --> 20:41.641
THE 250 BROKERS
THAT WE HAVE.

20:41.675 --> 20:42.676
[exhales]

20:42.709 --> 20:43.777
I DIDN'T SAY
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.079
I JUST TOLD THEM
THAT I NEEDED THEIR HELP.

20:46.112 --> 20:49.516
WOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR COMING.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.717
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.285
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP

20:52.318 --> 20:53.887
BECAUSE OF HOW EXCITED I AM
TO ACTUALLY MAKE THIS HAPPEN,

20:53.920 --> 20:55.155
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

20:55.188 --> 20:57.657
IN ANY OTHER AGENCY,
THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.959
THIS GUY WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSING
AND SAYS, "I'M TOO BUSY."

21:00.060 --> 21:01.861
THIS GUY WOULD HAVE BEEN LAZY,
JERKING OFF IN THE BAHAMAS.

21:01.895 --> 21:04.197
HE'S TOO BUSY.
[laughter]

21:04.230 --> 21:07.200
I WANT TO DO TODAY
WHAT NOBODY ELSE HAS DONE

21:07.233 --> 21:09.102
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS CITY,

21:09.135 --> 21:11.805
AND IT'S TO PUT
AN ENTIRE AGENCY, AS ONE UNIT,

21:11.838 --> 21:13.540
AND WORK TOWARDS
THE SAME GOAL,

21:13.573 --> 21:15.575
TO PROVE THAT AS A TEAM
AND A FAMILY,

21:15.608 --> 21:18.478
WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE,
CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS.

21:18.511 --> 21:21.748
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED YOU GUYS FOR.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.818
I HAVE ONE WEEK
TO SELL ONE SPECIFIC UNIT,

21:24.851 --> 21:27.687
AND I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE BUSY
LIKE THERE WAS NO TOMORROW,

21:27.721 --> 21:30.790
BUT IF WE CAN PICK UP THAT PHONE
FOR ONE HOUR,

21:30.824 --> 21:31.991
IF WE CAN PICK UP THAT PHONE

21:32.092 --> 21:33.393
AND WE CALL ABSOLUTELY
EVERYBODY,

21:33.426 --> 21:35.395
WE WILL FIND A BUYER--
THAT'S A FACT.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.897
AND WHOEVER
ACTUALLY SUCCEEDS,

21:37.931 --> 21:39.699
I'M GONNA GIVE 75%
ON THE COMMISSION,

21:39.733 --> 21:41.334
AND THEN,
THE REMAINING 25%,

21:41.368 --> 21:43.336
I'M GONNA SHARE
WITH THE ENTIRE AGENCY.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.105
I KNOW
WE'RE A LOT OF BROKERS,

21:45.138 --> 21:47.107
AND THAT--THAT SHARE
IS PROBABLY GONNA BE $1,

21:47.107 --> 21:49.142
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
THAT DOLLAR

21:49.175 --> 21:50.844
IS GONNA BE MUCH MORE
THAN ONE MILLION.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.846
WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS
A DOLLAR WELL-EARNED.

21:52.879 --> 21:56.016
AS A COMPANY,
AS A FAMILY.

21:56.116 --> 21:58.218
HUNDREDS OF BROKERS
WORKING TOGETHER

21:58.251 --> 21:59.352
TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL,

21:59.386 --> 22:01.054
I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT
BEFORE.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.889
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep] ABOUT
THE COMMISSION. I DON'T CARE.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.858
I'M SORRY I'M SPEAKING
THIS LANG--I'M PUERTO RICAN,

22:04.891 --> 22:06.860
SO I--
[laughter]

22:06.893 --> 22:09.396
NOW, WHO'S WITH ME?

22:09.429 --> 22:11.664
[applause]

22:11.698 --> 22:13.800
LET'S GO CALL LIKE
THERE WAS NO GODDAMN TOMORROW.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.201
ALL RIGHT.

22:15.235 --> 22:16.403
AND I'M GONNA SEND
ALL THE DETAILS

22:16.436 --> 22:17.504
ON AN EMAIL
TO EVERYBODY.

22:17.537 --> 22:18.538
[applause]

22:18.571 --> 22:19.839
EVERYBODY'S WITH ME.

22:19.873 --> 22:21.341
I HAVE BUILT AN ARMY,

22:21.374 --> 22:22.409
AND WE'RE GOING AFTER THIS.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.610
ALL RIGHT.

22:23.643 --> 22:24.711
- I'M CALLING EVERYBODY I KNOW
RIGHT NOW.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.312
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS, MAN.
I APPRECIATE IT.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.347
- YOU'RE A NATURAL.
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.350
[funky music]

22:30.383 --> 22:34.554
* *

22:34.587 --> 22:36.556
- THE INTEREST
FROM MY OPEN HOUSE

22:36.589 --> 22:39.292
AT 46 LISPENARD
WAS THROUGH THE ROOF,

22:39.325 --> 22:40.326
AND EVER SINCE,
I'VE BEEN TAKING CALLS

22:40.360 --> 22:41.895
FROM INTERESTED BROKERS.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.797
"2W, 2E."

22:43.830 --> 22:45.598
I'VE HAD THIS BUILDING
ONLY FOR FIVE DAYS,

22:45.632 --> 22:47.867
BUT I'VE BEEN RESPONDING
TO EVERYONE UNDER THE SUN

22:47.901 --> 22:49.102
TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.905
SO TODAY,
I'M SCHEDULING APPOINTMENTS

22:51.938 --> 22:53.540
15 MINUTES APART.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.476
- HOW'S EVERYTHING?
- OH, MY GOD. SO BUSY.

22:56.509 --> 22:57.811
I'M MEETING SEVERAL PEOPLE
HERE.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.646
I ONLY HAVE THREE MONTHS
TO SELL THIS ENTIRE BUILDING,

22:59.679 --> 23:01.715
SO I NEED TO SEE
AS MANY BROKERS AS I CAN

23:01.748 --> 23:03.416
IN THE SHORTEST AMOUNT
OF TIME.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.951
YOU WERE--YOU HAD A BUYER
FOR WHAT UNIT WAS IT?

23:05.051 --> 23:07.120
- 2E.
- OH, 2E. OKAY.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.889
SO, THE PRICE
IS 2,750,000,

23:09.923 --> 23:12.258
SO ARE YOU READY TO SEND ME
A DEAL SHEET?

23:12.292 --> 23:14.561
- I'VE ONLY BEEN AUTHORIZED
TO GO UP TO 2.4.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.829
- OKAY.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.865
- AND THE REASON FOR THAT--
SMALL BEDROOMS.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.268
- OKAY. UH, I LIKE YOU A LOT,
BUT THE PRICE IS 2,750,000.

23:22.302 --> 23:23.269
- THAT'S FULL ASK.

23:23.303 --> 23:24.671
- I KNOW IT'S FULL ASK,

23:24.704 --> 23:26.539
'CAUSE IT'S THE ONLY--
ONLY THING WE'RE TAKING.

23:26.573 --> 23:27.807
- [laughs]
- THERE'S NO NEGOTIATION.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.576
I HAVE MANY PEOPLE IN LINE.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.111
THERE SHE IS.
SHE'S ALREADY HERE.

23:31.144 --> 23:32.245
SHE'S SITTING THERE,
SHE'S WAITING.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.848
SHE WANTS THE SAME UNIT,
2E, YOU UNDERSTAND?

23:34.881 --> 23:36.483
IT'S LIKE SPEED DATING.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.917
I'VE GOTTEN INSTRUCTIONS
FROM JONATHAN

23:37.951 --> 23:41.755
TO SELL THE BUILDING QUICKLY
AND AT FULL ASK, NOTHING ELSE.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.623
MAGDA, YOU'RE NEXT.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.959
HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT ME TO
PRESENT ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT,

23:45.992 --> 23:47.994
SO I NEED TO PLAY THESE BROKERS
AGAINST EACH OTHER

23:48.094 --> 23:51.097
TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION
THAT IF YOU DON'T BUY TODAY,

23:51.097 --> 23:53.400
IT MAY NOT BE THERE
TOMORROW.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.501
YOU ARE HERE FOR WHICH UNIT?
OH, MY GOD.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.969
THERE ARE SO MANY UNITS,
SO MANY BUYERS.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.338
- THIS ONE, BABY. HERE.
- HMM. 3E.

23:58.371 --> 24:00.407
- 3W.
- 2W.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.042
- OH, I LOVE 2W.

24:02.075 --> 24:04.811
YOU HAVE A FULL ASK OFFER,
ALL CASH, I'M ASSUMING?

24:04.844 --> 24:05.912
- WELL, I'VE NEVER HEARD

24:05.945 --> 24:07.547
THAT ANYBODY MAKES
A FULL OFFER RIGHT AWAY.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.350
- MY OFFER IS 2,400,000.
- [laughs]

24:10.383 --> 24:11.918
YOU'RE HILARIOUS.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.086
- WHAT IS YOUR COUNTER-OFFER?

24:13.119 --> 24:15.055
I MEAN, COME ON,
WHAT IS YOUR COUNTER-OFFER?

24:15.055 --> 24:17.257
- I REALLY DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY NEGOTIABILITY HERE.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.558
YOU KNOW
HOW THESE THINGS GO.

24:18.591 --> 24:19.693
I MEAN, WE'RE BACK
TO THE OLD DAYS.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.127
THINGS ARE SELLING QUICKLY.

24:21.161 --> 24:22.962
- WE ALREADY LOOKED AT
THE COMPS AND EVERYTHING.

24:23.063 --> 24:25.065
- WHAT COMPS?
ON THE STREET?

24:25.065 --> 24:27.067
IN THE BLOCK?
- NO, IN THE BUILDING.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.835
- OKAY, WELL,
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE

24:28.868 --> 24:32.205
WHEN NOTHING'S
BEEN SIGNED YET?

24:32.238 --> 24:34.307
- ANYWAY,
WE CAN WORK IT OUT.

24:34.341 --> 24:37.177
- THIS IS MY STRATEGY--
NOT TO NEGOTIATE.

24:37.210 --> 24:40.146
THAT'S NEGOTIATION.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.182
- YOU'RE TOUGH, MAN.

24:42.215 --> 24:43.416
- HE'S KILLING ME.

24:43.450 --> 24:47.087
TRY TO GET HIM LOWER?
AND IF I DON'T?

24:47.087 --> 24:48.822
IF I DON'T LATER?

24:48.855 --> 24:51.424
- I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.
- WHEN?

24:51.458 --> 24:53.526
TWO HOURS?
IT MIGHT BE SOLD.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.095
- [groans]

24:55.095 --> 24:56.863
- PLAYING HARDBALL
WITH BROKERS LIKE THIS

24:56.896 --> 24:58.431
IS A THIN LINE,
AND IT'S VERY RISKY.

24:58.465 --> 25:00.467
IT COULD BACKFIRE.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.801
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.436
- WHAT'S RIDICULOUS?
- 2.75?

25:03.470 --> 25:04.637
THAT'S TOO MUCH
FOR THAT APARTMENT.

25:04.671 --> 25:05.805
- OKAY.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.474
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE

25:07.507 --> 25:09.275
THIS IS THE STRATEGY
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

25:09.309 --> 25:11.778
TO SELL OUT THIS ENTIRE BUILDING
IN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.713
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:13.747 --> 25:15.482
YOU GOT IT.
- WE HAVE A DEAL?

25:15.515 --> 25:16.783
- WE HAVE A DEAL.
- WE HAVE A DEAL.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.586
- I'LL GET 'EM TO DO IT.
LET'S JUST DO IT.

25:19.619 --> 25:20.954
- YOU'RE SO GOOD, FREDRIK.

25:21.054 --> 25:22.922
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
THE NUMBER ONE IN THE CITY.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.958
- LAURA, YOU'RE NEXT.

25:25.058 --> 25:27.961
[funky music]

25:28.061 --> 25:29.763
* *

25:29.796 --> 25:31.231
[horn honks]

25:31.264 --> 25:35.068
* *

25:35.101 --> 25:38.104
- ALL RIGHT.

25:38.138 --> 25:39.572
THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME.

25:39.606 --> 25:40.774
- YEAH, IT LOOKS GREAT.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.676
* *

25:42.709 --> 25:44.711
SO, UH,
LIKE WE SAID BEFORE,

25:44.744 --> 25:45.912
OBVIOUSLY,
THIS IS YOUR APARTMENT.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.280
YOU'RE KIND OF GONNA
COME HOME FROM WORK.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.982
MARY AND YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY
IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP.

25:49.082 --> 25:50.417
- IT'S TRUE.
- THE IDEA IS THAT YOU COME IN.

25:50.450 --> 25:51.651
YOU START GETTING
COMFORTABLE,

25:51.685 --> 25:53.086
AND WE'LL SHOOT YOU HERE
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

25:53.086 --> 25:54.854
WE'RE GONNA SHOOT YOU GUYS
DOING A KITCHEN SCENE.

25:54.888 --> 25:56.623
- MARY C AND THE PRODUCERS
THOUGHT

25:56.656 --> 25:59.159
THAT SINCE I HAD SOMEWHAT
OF AN ACTING BACKGROUND

25:59.192 --> 26:01.294
AND THIS LEFT DIMPLE,

26:01.327 --> 26:03.496
THAT, WHY NOT HAVE ME
BE IN THE MUSIC VIDEO?

26:03.530 --> 26:05.065
SO, WE'RE SHOWCASING
THE APARTMENT.

26:05.098 --> 26:06.266
- MOST DEFINITELY.

26:06.299 --> 26:07.767
- 'CAUSE THAT'S
THE MOST IMPORTANT...

26:07.801 --> 26:09.469
PAT IS AWAY
ON A BUSINESS TRIP,

26:09.502 --> 26:10.870
AND IF HE FOUND OUT
I WAS MAKING A MUSIC VIDEO

26:10.904 --> 26:12.505
IN HIS APARTMENT,

26:12.539 --> 26:14.140
HE'D CHOP MY NUTS OFF.

26:14.174 --> 26:15.675
WE HAVE TO BE
VERY, VERY CAREFUL OF NOT,

26:15.709 --> 26:17.911
LIKE, MESSING IT UP,
'CAUSE THE FURNITURE

26:17.944 --> 26:19.713
AND THE RENOVATIONS
IN HERE ALONE ARE--

26:19.746 --> 26:21.081
IT'S, LIKE,
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

26:21.114 --> 26:22.749
- WHOA. NO PRESSURE.
- YEAH, NO PRESSURE.

26:22.782 --> 26:23.750
- [laughs]

26:23.783 --> 26:25.318
[upbeat music]

26:25.352 --> 26:26.853
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.488
SO, WE'LL HAVE RYAN
WALK IN,

26:28.521 --> 26:30.623
GET THE DOOR OPENING--
A NICE REVEAL OF THE APARTMENT.

26:30.657 --> 26:32.592
AND...
- ACTION.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.394
* *

26:34.427 --> 26:35.562
- ALL RIGHT,
SO QUICKLY WALK IN.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.697
KIND OF COMING HOME
FROM WORK.

26:37.731 --> 26:40.867
DROP YOUR JACKET.
STAY THERE. YEP. THAT'S NICE.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.869
AND THEN MAYBE JUST KIND OF
STARE OUT AT THE CITY.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.371
DEFINITELY HAM IT UP A BIT,
RYAN.

26:44.404 --> 26:46.106
- SO WE'RE DOING
THE KITCHEN SCENE NOW?

26:46.139 --> 26:47.107
- YES.

26:47.140 --> 26:48.108
- GET GOOD SHOTS
OF THE KITCHEN,

26:48.141 --> 26:49.242
BECAUSE THE KITCHEN IS--

26:49.275 --> 26:50.477
THIS IS THE COOLEST KITCHEN
IN THE BUILDING.

26:50.510 --> 26:52.178
- AND ACTION.

26:52.212 --> 26:53.313
- AND RYAN,
TAKE A SMALL STEP BACK.

26:53.346 --> 26:54.314
- THE SHOOT IS ACTUALLY

26:54.347 --> 26:55.949
GOING PRETTY WELL SO FAR.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.951
AND YOU CAN SEE THE BATHROOM
IN THE SHOT?

26:57.984 --> 26:59.352
CAN YOU SEE HOW
THE INSIDE OF THE BATHROOM IS?

26:59.386 --> 27:00.854
- WE'RE GONNA PAU--YES.
- OKAY.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.489
- ACTION, GUYS.

27:02.522 --> 27:04.024
- SHOOTING VIGNETTES
IN EVERY SINGLE ROOM,

27:04.024 --> 27:06.359
YOU KNOW, FROM THE OFFICE
AND THE LIVING ROOM

27:06.393 --> 27:07.427
TO THE BATHROOM SCENES

27:07.460 --> 27:08.561
TO ROLLING AROUND
ON THE BED...

27:08.595 --> 27:09.796
- NOW WE'VE GOT
A CLOSE-UP ON YOU.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.865
SO, HAM IT UP, RYAN.
- [laughs]

27:11.898 --> 27:13.366
- YOU GET TO SEE
THE APARTMENT.

27:17.303 --> 27:20.273
HEY. OH, AND DRUMS.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.641
- SWEET.
ARE THERE MORE?

27:21.675 --> 27:23.476
I MEAN, THAT'S, LIKE,
20 PEOPLE.

27:23.510 --> 27:25.178
[exhales]

27:25.211 --> 27:26.346
THERE ARE
A MILLION PEOPLE HERE

27:26.379 --> 27:29.716
DOING EVERYTHING
PAT SAID NOT TO DO.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.418
UGH!
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

27:31.451 --> 27:33.620
[blues music]

27:33.653 --> 27:36.189
- YEAH.
- OKAY, ARE WE READY?

27:36.222 --> 27:37.524
- IT'LL BE PRETTY QUIE--
IT'LL BE PRETTY QUIET, RIGHT?

27:37.557 --> 27:39.659
- THIS IS LOUD.
[playing music]

27:39.693 --> 27:40.960
- THAT'S PRETTY LOUD,
THAT'S PRETTY LOUD.

27:41.061 --> 27:42.362
SO, EITHER I'M GONNA GO

27:42.395 --> 27:44.364
TO A REALLY,
REALLY SPECIAL HELL

27:44.397 --> 27:46.332
FOR REAL ESTATE AGENTS,

27:46.366 --> 27:48.935
OR I'M GONNA MAKE PAT
A VERY HAPPY MAN.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.404
- * OH, LOVE *

27:51.438 --> 27:53.573
* AUTOMATIC,
AUTOMATIC *

27:53.606 --> 27:57.077
* OOH, I JUST
GOT TO HAVE IT *

27:57.077 --> 27:58.345
* HAVE IT *

27:58.378 --> 28:03.450
* LOVE AUTOMATIC,
ON DEMAND *

28:03.483 --> 28:05.418
* IT ISN'T THE WAY
I LOVE YOU *

28:05.452 --> 28:07.787
* YOU, YOU *

28:07.821 --> 28:09.022
* *

28:09.022 --> 28:10.657
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THAT IS A WRAP.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.292
- OH, THANK GOD.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

28:12.325 --> 28:13.827
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S WRAP UP
AND GET OUT OF HERE

28:13.860 --> 28:16.629
BEFORE THE OWNER
COMES HOME.

28:16.663 --> 28:19.632
[upbeat music]

28:19.666 --> 28:23.937
* *

28:24.037 --> 28:26.172
- ALL RIGHT.

28:26.206 --> 28:28.375
MY STRATEGY IS WORKING.

28:28.408 --> 28:29.843
THREE AGENTS FROM MY FIRM

28:29.876 --> 28:32.379
FOUND POTENTIAL BUYERS
FOR SHOWINGS TODAY,

28:32.412 --> 28:34.714
AND I'M VERY EXCITED.

28:34.748 --> 28:35.749
I KNOW I CAN DO THIS.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.784
RIGHT NEXT DOOR,
46 LISPENARD,

28:37.817 --> 28:39.486
IS VERY HOT RIGHT NOW,

28:39.519 --> 28:41.521
AND IT'S
A VERY HOT NEIGHBORHOOD.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.256
BUT I ALSO KNOW
THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS PLACE

28:43.289 --> 28:45.225
WHEN IT COMES TO SHOWING IT.

28:45.258 --> 28:46.426
THERE'S NO STAGING,
SO I HAVE TO BE ANIMATED

28:46.459 --> 28:48.762
AND TRY TO GET THEM
TO ENJOY THEMSELVES,

28:48.795 --> 28:51.231
BRING THEIR ENERGY UP.

28:51.264 --> 28:54.167
- LUIS. HI.
- GUYS, WELCOME TO MECCA.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.769
HOW ARE YOU?
IT'S A PLEASURE. LUIS.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.203
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?

28:57.237 --> 28:58.905
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR COMING. HOW ARE YOU?

28:58.938 --> 29:00.306
LUIS. NICE TO MEET YOU.
- I'M MARCUS.

29:00.340 --> 29:01.307
- HI.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR COMING.

29:02.609 --> 29:03.910
HOW ARE YOU?
- JOE. HOW ARE YOU?

29:04.010 --> 29:05.145
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

29:05.178 --> 29:06.846
WELL, WELCOME TO
50 LISPENARD, APARTMENT 2.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.381
- BEAUTIFUL.
VERY NICE.

29:08.415 --> 29:11.151
- PLEASE, SHOW US AROUND, LUIS.
- YES, LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.

29:11.184 --> 29:14.020
EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE,
IT'S COMPLETELY ORIGINAL.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.022
YOU HAVE 2,000 SQUARE FOOT
OF OPEN SPACE.

29:16.022 --> 29:18.324
WINDOWS ARE LANDMARKED,
BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO PRESERVE

29:18.358 --> 29:19.926
AS MUCH OF THE HISTORY
AS POSSIBLE.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.027
- RIGHT.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.829
- AND I THINK, UH...
- OH! CAREFUL.

29:22.862 --> 29:25.031
- PROBABLY--WOW, YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE A TERRACE HERE.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.233
- A TERRACE?
- LOOK AT THAT.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.768
- LET'S NOT GO CRAZY.
[laughter]

29:28.802 --> 29:30.170
- MY STYLE OF SHOWING

29:30.203 --> 29:32.739
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
FROM ALL THE OTHER AGENTS.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.641
- I LOVE THE, UH,
RAINFALL SHOWERS.

29:34.674 --> 29:36.142
- THE RAIN SHOWER, YES.
- YES.

29:37.544 --> 29:39.612
[laughter]

29:39.646 --> 29:40.847
- AND TO PROVE THAT THAT'S
ACTUALLY EXPOSED BRICK,

29:40.880 --> 29:42.349
THEY SAY IF YOU PUT
YOUR TONGUE IN THE BRICK

29:42.382 --> 29:44.050
AND IT STICKS,
IT MEANS IT'S TRUE.

29:44.084 --> 29:45.518
- ARE YOU GONNA TRY IT?
- IT'S REAL.

29:45.552 --> 29:47.787
IF I CAN LET THE CLIENTS
SEE THE FACT

29:47.821 --> 29:49.289
THAT I AM AUTHENTICALLY
IN LOVE WITH THIS PROPERTY,

29:49.322 --> 29:51.157
THEY WILL FALL IN LOVE
WITH IT AS WELL.

29:51.191 --> 29:52.959
- HE'S REALLY GONNA DO IT.

29:55.195 --> 29:57.130
- IT ACTUALLY STICKS.
- WOW.

29:57.163 --> 29:58.264
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE READ THAT
AND DIDN'T EVEN TRY IT.

29:58.298 --> 30:00.266
- IT'S COLD ENOUGH,
RIGHT?

30:00.300 --> 30:02.235
[laughter]

30:02.268 --> 30:03.403
* *

30:03.436 --> 30:05.071
- SO, NOW,
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

30:05.105 --> 30:06.873
YOU ARE ONE OF
THE VERY FEW PEOPLE

30:06.906 --> 30:08.975
THAT ARE ACTUALLY GETTING
FIRST ACCESS TO THIS APARTMENT,

30:09.009 --> 30:10.710
AND ONCE IT'S RELEASED,
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HOT.

30:10.744 --> 30:11.811
ARE YOU READY TO
MAKE AN OFFER

30:11.845 --> 30:13.079
OR ARE YOU READY
TO MAKE AN OFFER?

30:13.113 --> 30:14.247
- IT'S VERY NICE BUT,
YOU KNOW,

30:14.280 --> 30:16.016
I--I'VE STILL
GOT TO LOOK AROUND.

30:16.049 --> 30:18.785
- I DO LIKE THE APARTMENT,
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE

30:18.818 --> 30:20.353
ALL THE AMENITIES
WE TALK ABOUT.

34:24.864 --> 34:26.299
THIS IS SO EXCITING.
I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME.

34:26.332 --> 34:27.300
SIT DOWN.

A MEETING WITH JONATHAN

34:31.271 --> 34:32.572

SO, I HAVE REALLY GOOD NEWS.
- GREAT.

34:35.942 --> 34:37.544

SIX DEAL SHEETS.

DEAL SHEETS.

34:55.095 --> 34:59.232
FULL ASK, ALL CASH,
ALL OF THEM.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.533
AND THEY'RE ALL PAYING
THEIR OWN CLOSING COSTS,

35:00.567 --> 35:04.471
WHICH I'VE REALLY
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

35:04.504 --> 35:05.638
WAH, WAH, WAH!

35:05.672 --> 35:07.741
IT FEELS SO GOOD
TO DO THIS

35:07.774 --> 35:09.042
AND TO DO IT IN A WEEK.

35:09.042 --> 35:11.211
IT'S UNHEARD OF,
REALLY.

35:11.244 --> 35:12.946
THAT'S SIX UNITS.

35:13.046 --> 35:16.416
BASICALLY, WE'RE OVER
HALF SOLD OUT IN ONE WEEK.

35:18.051 --> 35:19.953
- UM, 2,750,000.

35:20.053 --> 35:21.788
THEY'RE ALL FOR FULL ASK,

35:21.821 --> 35:24.124
AND YOU DID THIS
ALL AT THE SAME TIME?

35:24.157 --> 35:25.492
- YEAH.

35:25.525 --> 35:27.060
- SO, WHY ARE YOU
RUSHING THROUGH IT?

35:27.060 --> 35:28.628
I GAVE YOU THREE MONTHS
TO DO THIS.

35:28.661 --> 35:30.730
- THIS IS NOT
THE REACTION I WAS, UH,

35:30.764 --> 35:33.066
THINKING THAT I-I WOULD GET
FROM A SELLER?

35:33.099 --> 35:34.267
- I THINK IF YOU SOLD OUT--
IF YOU SOLD THEM IN A WEEK,

35:34.300 --> 35:35.869
I THINK MAYBE YOU
SHOULD HAVE RAISED PRICES.

35:35.902 --> 35:37.137
- AND WHY IS THAT?

35:37.170 --> 35:38.338
- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,

35:38.371 --> 35:40.073
THERE'S A HUGE DEMAND
FOR THIS BUILDING.

35:40.106 --> 35:41.374
- NO, NO,
YOU'RE MISUNDERSTANDING.

35:41.408 --> 35:42.742
LET ME EXPLAIN IT
DIFFERENTLY.

35:42.776 --> 35:43.777
YOU GAVE ME A BUILDING.
- SURE.

35:43.810 --> 35:45.078
- YOU WANTED ME TO BE QUICK.

35:45.078 --> 35:46.646
- YEAH, BUT ON
A SQUARE-FOOT BASIS,

35:46.680 --> 35:49.783
I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER
$3/4 MILLION HERE

35:49.816 --> 35:50.950
THAT WE COULD GET.

35:50.984 --> 35:53.653
[dramatic music]

35:53.687 --> 35:57.257
- THE MARKET IS $1,000 A FOOT.
I'M GETTING $1,400 A FOOT.

35:57.290 --> 35:58.625
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- I DO UNDERSTAND.

35:58.658 --> 36:01.127
- I'M GETTING 40% MORE
THAN ANYONE HAS EVER GOTTEN

36:01.161 --> 36:04.564
ON THESE COUPLE OF BLOCKS,
AND YOU'RE NOT HAPPY?

36:04.597 --> 36:06.399
- I-I COULD BE HAPPIER,
FREDRIK.

36:06.433 --> 36:08.101
I MEAN--
- [exhales]

36:08.134 --> 36:10.637
OH, MY GOD,
THIS TIE IS SO TIGHT.

36:10.670 --> 36:14.174
MY FRIEND, I'M GETTING YOU
THE FULL-ASK PRICES

36:14.207 --> 36:15.508
THAT YOU AND I AGREED
ON THAT SOFA ONE WEEK AGO...

36:15.542 --> 36:17.477
- WE DID.
- THAT YOU WERE EXCITED ABOUT.

36:17.510 --> 36:18.511
- I KNOW, I GET IT.
IT'S NOT MY FIRST DEAL.

36:18.545 --> 36:19.679
- NO, YOU DON'T GET IT.

36:19.713 --> 36:22.115
I WORKED MY ASS OFF.
LISTEN TO ME NOW.

36:22.148 --> 36:24.050
I WORKED TIRELESSLY.

36:24.050 --> 36:26.052
I DO A HUGE OPEN HOUSE

36:26.052 --> 36:28.321
AND I BUILD THIS URGENCY
AND MOMENTUM.

36:28.355 --> 36:29.656
THERE WAS INTEREST, YES,

36:29.689 --> 36:33.059
BUT I MANAGED
TO PULL TOGETHER THESE DEALS.

36:33.093 --> 36:34.661
I CREATED THIS.

36:34.694 --> 36:35.762
- DO YOU THINK
THAT WE CAN GET ANY MORE?

36:35.795 --> 36:37.497
I MEAN, YOU GOT THESE
IN A WEEK.

36:37.530 --> 36:39.065
- NO, I THINK
WE CAN GET A LOT LESS

36:39.065 --> 36:40.367
IF WE DON'T ACT
RIGHT NOW.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.469
EVERYTHING SELLS IN THE
VERY BEGINNING OF AN EXCLUSIVE

36:42.502 --> 36:44.070
IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT.

36:44.070 --> 36:46.072
SOMETIMES,
US REAL ESTATE AGENTS

36:46.106 --> 36:47.774
NEED TO PROTECT THE SELLERS
FROM THEMSELVES.

36:47.807 --> 36:49.743
THESE ARE NOT ONLY
GOOD PRICES,

36:49.776 --> 36:52.712
THEY ARE HOME-RUN,
RECORD-SETTING PRICES

36:52.746 --> 36:54.314
AND HE NEEDS TO ACCEPT THAT.

36:54.347 --> 36:55.482
- FREDRIK, ALL RIGHT.

36:55.515 --> 36:57.217
LET'S, UH,
CALM DOWN A MINUTE.

36:57.250 --> 36:59.819
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

36:59.853 --> 37:02.322
IF WE PULL THE REST
OFF THE MARKET,

37:02.355 --> 37:04.257
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT IN SIX MONTHS,

37:04.290 --> 37:06.760
WE CAN GET MORE MONEY?

37:06.793 --> 37:08.895
- IF YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY
THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT,

37:08.928 --> 37:09.896
I MEAN,
I'M VERY LOYAL TO YOU.

37:09.929 --> 37:11.031
I WILL WAIT WITH YOU.

37:11.031 --> 37:13.667
AND YES, WE CAN REVISIT
THE PRICING ISSUE

37:13.700 --> 37:16.436
ON THOSE
REMAINING UNITS THEN.

37:16.469 --> 37:18.038
BUT THESE, YOU'RE GONNA
ACCEPT RIGHT NOW.

37:18.071 --> 37:21.374
- UM...

37:21.408 --> 37:22.609
- JUST UNDERSTAND.

37:22.642 --> 37:24.511
LIKE, THESE PEOPLE
ARE EXCITED.

37:24.544 --> 37:25.812

37:25.845 --> 37:28.281

37:30.150 --> 37:33.319
- OKAY, SO, FREDRIK,
LET'S ACCEPT THESE SIX

GETTING.

37:34.554 --> 37:35.689
LET'S TAKE THEM.

37:35.722 --> 37:37.057
YOU DID WHAT YOU SAID
YOU WOULD DO.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.725
AND THEN, UH,
WE'LL REVISIT THE OTHER UNITS.

37:38.758 --> 37:40.660
- SO,
YOU'RE ACCEPTING THESE?

37:40.694 --> 37:42.395
WE HAVE A DEAL ON THESE SIX?
- YES, YES.

37:42.429 --> 37:43.396

THE CONTRACTS QUICKLY?

37:45.799 --> 37:47.067
NO FUN AND GAMES?
- NO FUN AND GAMES.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.668
- NO, LIKE,
CHANGING YOUR MIND AGAIN?

37:48.702 --> 37:49.669
- NO.

37:49.703 --> 37:51.571
- THANK GOD.

37:51.604 --> 37:52.572
JONATHAN HAS COME
TO HIS SENSES,

37:52.605 --> 37:53.907

37:53.940 --> 37:56.543
MMM, SIX DEALS

CHING-CHING!

37:59.646 --> 38:01.181
I GOTTA GO.

38:01.214 --> 38:02.282

38:02.315 --> 38:03.650
BEFORE HE RUNS AFTER ME
IN HIS BOOTIES

38:03.683 --> 38:04.851
AND CHANGES HIS MIND.

38:04.884 --> 38:06.686
GOOD SEEING YOU.
