00:19.018 --> 00:21.019
I'm bored.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.021
Somebody do
something interesting.

00:23.022 --> 00:24.589
Well, wait till you
see our new handshake.

00:24.590 --> 00:25.957
Up top, time to mop.

00:25.958 --> 00:27.225
And...
Bop!

00:27.226 --> 00:28.259
It isn't ready yet.

00:28.294 --> 00:29.761
Yeah, it is pretty slow today.

00:29.762 --> 00:31.028
You guys want to take
the day off, maybe?

00:31.064 --> 00:32.363
Go have some fun...

00:32.365 --> 00:33.531
How'd you get to
the door so fast?

00:33.566 --> 00:34.732
Adios! Later! Bye!

00:34.767 --> 00:36.368
I just said it.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.002
Be back in time to help
clean up after closing.

00:38.037 --> 00:39.371
Aw, if you two would
move a little faster,

00:39.372 --> 00:40.871
we wouldn't have heard that.

00:40.907 --> 00:43.709
But you did
and now you got to help.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.710
Hey!

00:44.711 --> 00:46.445
These are all stained.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.780
I told the kids not to store
the napkins under the sink.

00:48.781 --> 00:49.680
They're all ruined.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.316
On the plus side,

00:51.317 --> 00:52.718
you made three in a row.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.885
I know.
Watch this.

00:53.886 --> 00:55.386
Sky hook! Ah!

00:55.421 --> 00:57.722
So what do you say...
normal day off stuff?

00:57.757 --> 00:59.324
Or we could try something new?

00:59.325 --> 01:00.792
Hitch hike to Myrtle Beach?

01:00.793 --> 01:02.127
Meet all the Myrtles?
No, no, no, no.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.962
Let's stick with
the tried and true.

01:03.963 --> 01:05.564
We look for loose change
under the pier,

01:05.565 --> 01:07.099
use that to buy
some Fortune Fudge,

01:07.100 --> 01:09.000
then ride the Zany Plane...
inverted...

01:09.001 --> 01:10.802
throw up,
and do it all over again?

01:10.803 --> 01:12.737
You really like getting
your inverted on, huh?

01:14.774 --> 01:16.341
I'm developing a taste for it.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.443
We've already inverted ourselves
twice this month.

01:18.444 --> 01:19.845
When is enough enough?!

01:19.846 --> 01:21.946
When we're out of throw up? Yes.

01:21.981 --> 01:23.415
Found another quarter!

01:23.416 --> 01:25.116
Two dimes
and six pennies for me!

01:25.151 --> 01:26.518
I always get the worst section!

01:26.519 --> 01:28.753
Nothing but bottle caps
and Band-Aids!

01:28.788 --> 01:30.188
- No way.
- Yes way.

01:30.189 --> 01:32.156
A two-butted goat?
Impossible.

01:32.191 --> 01:33.959
I swear I saw it...
two butts.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.293
On a farm, right past
that cornfield on Route 6.

01:36.329 --> 01:37.763
Just stop trying to impress me.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.130
We're already friends.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.731
Two-butted goat!

01:40.767 --> 01:42.833
Two-butted goat!!!

01:42.869 --> 01:44.135
<i>Watch this one, Lin.</i>

01:44.170 --> 01:46.771
Off the counter and swish!

01:46.806 --> 01:47.839
Well not swish, but...

01:47.840 --> 01:48.874
Ah, good one.

01:48.875 --> 01:49.875
You weren't even looking.

01:49.876 --> 01:51.009
You try.
It's fun.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.310
Take a few shots.
Nah.

01:52.311 --> 01:53.345
Come on, the restaurant
is empty.

01:53.346 --> 01:54.646
Hey, we could play Horse.

01:54.647 --> 01:55.781
I don't know.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.449
Maybe if we don't keep score.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.984
Well, you can't play Horse
without keeping score.

01:58.985 --> 01:59.984
You have to.

02:00.019 --> 02:01.186
It's just... we can get

02:01.187 --> 02:02.387
a little competitive.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.455
You get a little in your head.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.989
I get a little in your face.

02:05.024 --> 02:07.091
We won't get like
that this time, I promise.

02:07.126 --> 02:09.161
Okay, I mean,
it's not really fair.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.463
I <i> was</i> fourth-grade
hoop-shoot champion.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.898
And you weren't, so...

02:12.899 --> 02:14.665
Okay, take it easy.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.033
Boosh!
All right.

02:16.068 --> 02:17.601
Now I have to make
the same shot.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.336
And I miss.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.139
Huh, all right, so I get an "H."

02:21.140 --> 02:22.407
Yeah you do.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.309
Which is good and fine.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.377
And this is fun.

02:25.378 --> 02:26.411
I'm having fun.

02:26.412 --> 02:27.913
Not at all in my head.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.648
Spin around clockwise
and then yell out

02:29.649 --> 02:31.216
your favorite Meryl Streep
movie... <i>It's Complicated!</i>

02:31.217 --> 02:32.551
Yeah!

02:32.552 --> 02:33.585
In your face!

02:33.586 --> 02:35.020
I mean, not in your face.

02:35.021 --> 02:36.220
Sportsmanship.

02:36.255 --> 02:38.190
You're seriously telling me

02:38.191 --> 02:40.691
you don't want to go
and see a two-butted goat.

02:40.726 --> 02:43.028
That cornfield on Route 6
is really far away.

02:43.029 --> 02:45.096
Also, there's no such thing
as a two-butted goat, Gene.

02:45.097 --> 02:47.833
Yeah, call me when
there's a two-butted boy.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.001
Or just tell me,
since we live at the same place.

02:50.002 --> 02:51.870
We never do anything
I want to do!

02:51.871 --> 02:53.505
No, we did that one time.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.207
We went to the hospital
when you got a concussion.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.241
Remember?
No!

02:57.276 --> 02:59.211
Plus, we have
a great day planned.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.779
Now let's read our fortunes.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.247
"Stay away from teenage skunks,

03:02.248 --> 03:05.584
they have P-U-berty."
Ha-ha! Na...

03:05.585 --> 03:08.086
"If 'ifs' and 'buts'
were candies and nuts,

03:08.087 --> 03:09.855
we'd all be eating our words."

03:09.856 --> 03:11.423
Butts!
It's a sign!

03:11.424 --> 03:13.124
"The one destined
to be your true love

03:13.125 --> 03:14.960
will be revealed
at the end of a journey."

03:14.961 --> 03:16.595
Wow.
Intense.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.630
Oh, you got a piece
from the old batch.

03:18.631 --> 03:21.233
Before they started making
the fortunes hilarious.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.933
Yeah, it's old.

03:22.969 --> 03:25.237
Huh, is the ceiling fan
on a little higher?

03:25.238 --> 03:26.538
It's blustery.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.073
Ceiling fan.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.407
The only problem is
you're playing against

03:29.408 --> 03:31.276
the fourth-grade
hoop-shoot champ!

03:31.277 --> 03:32.444
It's like the fifth time
you've mentioned that.

03:33.446 --> 03:34.579
Teddy, come in!

03:34.580 --> 03:35.679
Can, uh, can I get you a burger?

03:35.715 --> 03:37.148
Nah, maybe just a coffee.

03:37.149 --> 03:38.617
And some fries.

03:38.618 --> 03:39.950
And a burger.
And a beer.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.218
What's going on here?
What are we doing?

03:41.254 --> 03:42.587
Oh, me and Bob
are playing Horse.

03:42.588 --> 03:43.854
He's about to lose.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.956
Oh, you guys are competing?
Uh-oh.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.459
Well, we'll have
to finish later, anyway.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.227
Uh, 'cause I have to go
make your food, so...

03:49.228 --> 03:50.262
Oh, no, no, no.
I'll wait.

03:50.263 --> 03:51.228
I want to see what happens.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.463
Um... okay.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.198
This will be
either fun or terrible.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.301
Bend the back, over the rack!

03:56.302 --> 03:57.635
Wow!
What's all this?

03:57.670 --> 03:59.036
They're playing horse.

03:59.071 --> 04:00.138
This is it, Bob.

04:00.139 --> 04:01.872
Game's on the line.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.742
Air ball!
I win!

04:03.743 --> 04:05.442
Is the sun coming in at
a weird angle or something?

04:05.478 --> 04:06.577
Eh... no.

04:06.612 --> 04:07.646
Uh, you know, I think

04:07.647 --> 04:08.647
I'm just too strong.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.115
I feel like I need, like,

04:10.116 --> 04:11.850
uh, something heavier.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.084
Still missed.

04:13.085 --> 04:14.619
Well, now, all right, hold on.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.254
I... H-How about a new game?!

04:16.255 --> 04:18.123
This game, uh,
is a little more challenging.

04:18.124 --> 04:20.492
I-It's, uh, like napkin darts.

04:20.493 --> 04:21.959
What the hell is napkin darts?

04:21.961 --> 04:23.227
Yes! We'll call it Narts!

04:23.262 --> 04:24.462
You call where you want
to throw it.

04:24.463 --> 04:26.531
Let's say, uh, that stool.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.300
And your opponent
has to make the same shot

04:28.301 --> 04:29.801
or they get a letter.

04:29.802 --> 04:31.835
But not to spell "horse,"
to spell "Narts."

04:31.871 --> 04:33.470
Seems like he's just
ripping off Horse.

04:33.506 --> 04:35.173
I don't know if I'm gonna
be any good at this.

04:35.174 --> 04:38.143
I'm a hoop-shoot champ.
This is different.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.310
Huh, not that different.

04:39.345 --> 04:40.378
I got next!

04:40.379 --> 04:41.880
Ah, I wish I had shorts on.

04:41.881 --> 04:43.081
Bob, can I borrow some shorts?

04:43.115 --> 04:44.448
Mmm, no.

04:44.483 --> 04:45.550
Hmm, the planes are looking

04:45.551 --> 04:47.185
extra zany today.

04:47.186 --> 04:49.453
How many butts does
a Zany Plane have?

04:49.488 --> 04:51.523
None!
This goat has two!

04:51.524 --> 04:53.325
Trust me, Gene.

04:53.326 --> 04:54.859
When we're flying
on this thing inverted,

04:54.860 --> 04:56.294
defying the laws of gravity

04:56.295 --> 04:58.129
and spitting in
the face of science,

04:58.130 --> 05:00.966
you'll forget all about
the two-butted goat.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.901
Two-butted goat?
Say butt, say what?

05:02.902 --> 05:04.268
Oh, hey guys.

05:04.303 --> 05:06.470
Hi, Jimmy Jr., Zeke.

05:06.505 --> 05:07.805
And Jocelyn and Tammy?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.341
I guess I didn't
get the invitation

05:09.342 --> 05:11.275
to the "Eighth Graders
Go to the Wharf Day"?

05:11.310 --> 05:13.310
That's not what this is.
We're just hanging out.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.814
Oh, phew. Yeah,
don't get your boobs in a bunch.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.015
We didn't even come together.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.316
It was just me and Zeke.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.385
And then <i> they</i> started
following us.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.052
You wish.
Where are you going next?

05:22.088 --> 05:23.221
Hey, guys.

05:23.222 --> 05:24.389
I followed
Tammy and Jocelyn here.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.490
Hi, Darryl.
Hey.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.725
Hi, guys.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.026
Rudy, when'd you get here?

05:28.027 --> 05:29.394
I've been here the whole time.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.162
Everyone keeps cutting
in front of me.

05:31.163 --> 05:32.396
Yeah, it's too crowded here.

05:32.431 --> 05:34.165
Zeke, let's go
on that ride over there.

05:34.166 --> 05:35.533
Ba-ba-ba, ho-ho!

05:35.534 --> 05:36.901
I want to hear about
this two-butted goat!

05:36.902 --> 05:37.901
Spill it!

05:37.937 --> 05:39.371
I was under the pier and I heard

05:39.372 --> 05:41.206
these guys talking
about a two-butted goat

05:41.207 --> 05:43.408
on a farm out by the cornfield
on Route 6.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.542
And I'm the only one
who wants to go see it!

05:45.578 --> 05:47.379
Well, count me in, Gene-o-sabe.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.948
Oh, come on, that can't be real.
You think?

05:49.949 --> 05:51.216
If a cow's got four stomachs,

05:51.217 --> 05:52.916
why can't a goat have two butts?

05:52.952 --> 05:54.853
Technically a cow
just has one stomach,

05:54.854 --> 05:56.454
with four separate chambers.

05:56.455 --> 05:58.223
But there was a two-faced
cat in England,

05:58.224 --> 06:00.458
so a two-butted goat
seems possible.

06:00.459 --> 06:01.759
All cats are two-faced.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.862
Guys, the Zany Plane
is super fun.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.196
And we're in line for it.

06:05.197 --> 06:06.865
Oh, and it's real.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.033
I want to go see
the two-butted goat!

06:09.068 --> 06:10.101
Me, too!

06:10.102 --> 06:11.736
Really, Zeke?
I mean, um...

06:11.737 --> 06:13.038
Yeah, me three.
I'll go.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.204
Sounds good.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.273
Maybe it's my destiny

06:15.274 --> 06:16.274
to go on this journey.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:17.376 --> 06:18.610
We could spend our whole day

06:18.611 --> 06:19.878
going to look for this thing,

06:19.879 --> 06:21.312
and it might not even exist!

06:21.313 --> 06:22.480
She's right.

06:22.481 --> 06:23.581
There's no guarantee it's real.

06:23.582 --> 06:25.216
But it might be.

06:25.217 --> 06:26.718
So I ask you...

06:26.719 --> 06:28.453
would you rather have
a lifetime of regret,

06:28.454 --> 06:31.722
or an afternoon
of mild disappointment?

06:31.757 --> 06:33.058
That is deep.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.325
I'll go if you go.
Oh, my God!

06:34.326 --> 06:35.460
I was just about
to say the same thing.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.228
I really was!
Oh, my God!

06:37.229 --> 06:38.730
Should we go? Should we go?
Should we go? Let's go!

06:38.731 --> 06:39.730
Let's go!

06:39.732 --> 06:41.499
I am... in!

06:41.500 --> 06:43.835
No, back out.

06:43.836 --> 06:45.702
Nope, back in.
I'm okay.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.105
Fine, I'll go.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.673
And when we get there
and there's no goat,

06:48.674 --> 06:50.508
Gene, you have
to do all the cleanup

06:50.509 --> 06:52.177
when we get back
to the restaurant.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.845
What if there is
a two-butted goat?

06:53.846 --> 06:55.346
Then <i> I'll</i> do all
the clean up. Deal!

06:55.347 --> 06:56.815
Either way, I don't
have to clean up.

06:56.816 --> 06:57.981
Sounds great.

06:58.017 --> 07:00.085
Follow me
to the two-butted goat!

07:03.355 --> 07:05.123
Does anyone know
where Route 6 is?

07:05.124 --> 07:06.825
Not at all. Nope. No!

07:06.826 --> 07:08.126
I don't know any of the roads.

07:08.127 --> 07:09.627
Then follow me
to the gas station

07:09.628 --> 07:11.129
to get a map and some beef jerky

07:11.130 --> 07:12.871
and use the bathroom!

07:15.296 --> 07:17.777
Everyone's doing
what I want to do

07:17.778 --> 07:19.211
and it feels great,
doesn't it... Darryl? Rudy?

07:19.212 --> 07:20.246
Pretty good.

07:20.247 --> 07:21.280
Wrong day to experiment

07:21.281 --> 07:22.882
with dress shoes and no socks.

07:22.883 --> 07:24.517
Just so you know, Gene,
if we get lost

07:24.518 --> 07:25.885
you still have to do
all the cleanup.

07:25.886 --> 07:27.219
Worth it!

07:27.220 --> 07:28.788
Looks like we just
stay on this road

07:28.789 --> 07:30.790
and it takes us to Route 6.

07:30.791 --> 07:32.391
And then there's
lots of dotted lines

07:32.392 --> 07:34.527
and a big green patch...
that must be Iowa.

07:34.528 --> 07:37.229
Those dotted lines
are probably fire roads.

07:37.230 --> 07:39.465
And it looks like this
one might be a shortcut.

07:39.466 --> 07:42.201
If the road's on fire,
we're not going on it. Yeah.

07:42.202 --> 07:44.303
Just kidding! We'll do
what everyone else does.

07:44.304 --> 07:46.706
Let's take the shortcut
and get there shorter!

07:46.707 --> 07:49.141
I don't know... they're
dotted lines for a reason.

07:49.142 --> 07:50.743
We don't know what's
in-between those dots.

07:50.744 --> 07:53.344
Let's find out!
We got some dots to connect!

07:53.380 --> 07:55.580
I'm just gonna say what
everyone's thinking.

07:55.615 --> 07:58.918
Does two butts mean three
cheeks or four cheeks or what?

07:58.919 --> 08:01.153
More importantly, are we talking
about separate anuses?

08:01.154 --> 08:03.556
Does that mean
it can fart in harmony?

08:03.557 --> 08:05.057
Fart-mony!

08:05.058 --> 08:06.559
I never even thought of that.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.327
This is bigger than I imagined.

08:08.328 --> 08:10.229
It's the biggest thing ever!

08:10.230 --> 08:11.263
And it's not real.

08:11.264 --> 08:13.165
Why are you being so negative?

08:13.166 --> 08:16.602
Well, for one, we should all
be riding the Zany Plane.

08:16.603 --> 08:19.138
And two, if a two-butted
goat does exist,

08:19.139 --> 08:20.573
don't you think
it'd probably have,

08:20.574 --> 08:23.075
like, it's own show on TLC?

08:23.076 --> 08:25.511
And three, overhearing
teenagers at the pier

08:25.512 --> 08:28.114
might not be the best
way to get information.

08:28.115 --> 08:30.116
Mmm, I would agree to disagree,
because that's actually

08:30.117 --> 08:31.951
how I learned that green
scrunchies are out.

08:31.952 --> 08:33.753
What? Oh,
my God you're being paranoid.

08:33.754 --> 08:35.988
I told you that I liked it.
I know.

08:35.989 --> 08:37.590
I believe it exists.

08:37.591 --> 08:39.424
The world is full
of mystery and magic!

08:39.426 --> 08:41.594
Yeah, if nature can make
all the different colors

08:41.595 --> 08:44.496
of autumn leaves,
why not a two-butted goat?

08:44.531 --> 08:45.531
Damn straight!

08:45.532 --> 08:47.166
I'm a bit of a leaf-peeper.

08:47.167 --> 08:49.034
<i>Whoa,
Rudy has a sensitive side.</i>

08:49.035 --> 08:50.770
<i>Could he be my destiny?</i>

08:50.771 --> 08:52.938
<i>In 20 years, the age difference
won't matter.</i>

08:52.939 --> 08:54.373
I never noticed before,

08:54.374 --> 08:56.142
but you look like my mother
when she's tired.

08:56.143 --> 08:57.175
<i>Probably not my destiny.</i>

08:59.585 --> 09:00.980
Okay.

09:00.981 --> 09:01.981
Nice and easy.

09:01.982 --> 09:03.182
You can do this.

09:03.183 --> 09:04.550
If you miss, you lose.

09:04.551 --> 09:06.385
You lose a game
that you invented.

09:06.386 --> 09:09.021
Sometime today, Bob.

09:09.022 --> 09:11.624
- Damn it!
- I beat Bob at Narts!

09:11.625 --> 09:12.792
Rematch!
I'm up.

09:12.793 --> 09:14.460
Oh, right.
Well, uh,

09:14.461 --> 09:16.195
maybe we should
do a-a tournament.

09:16.196 --> 09:18.297
Uh, Mort probably
wants in... right, Mort?

09:18.298 --> 09:19.398
Yeah, I'm feeling Narty.

09:19.399 --> 09:21.066
God, Mort!
You ruin everything.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.201
Sorry, I'm sorry.

09:22.202 --> 09:23.335
Great, I'll draw it up.

09:23.336 --> 09:25.337
Write my name up there
as "Win-da."

09:25.338 --> 09:26.505
No.
Yes!

09:26.506 --> 09:28.207
 Two, two

09:28.208 --> 09:30.409
 Two-butted goat!

09:30.410 --> 09:32.077
Our voices sound good together!

09:32.078 --> 09:33.712
No they don't.
Like Hall and Goats.

09:33.713 --> 09:35.147
Hey, I think that's
the fire road!

09:35.148 --> 09:36.649
Yeah!

09:36.650 --> 09:38.050
 Two, two, two-butted goat...

09:39.686 --> 09:41.554
Why are you dragging
your wagon, Jimmy Jr.?

09:41.555 --> 09:43.522
Yeah, aren't you excited?

09:43.523 --> 09:45.424
It's... this was supposed to be
a day with just me and Zeke.

09:45.425 --> 09:46.826
Look at them.

09:46.827 --> 09:48.327
It's "two-butted goat this,"

09:48.328 --> 09:50.229
and "our voices
sound good together that,"

09:50.230 --> 09:52.164
and "there's
the fire road this."

09:52.165 --> 09:54.500
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:54.501 --> 09:56.402
Are you jealous of Gene?

09:56.403 --> 09:58.370
What?!
Why-why would I be jealous

09:58.371 --> 10:00.105
of Mr. "Perfect-hears-about

10:00.106 --> 10:01.841
every-two-butted-goat
in-the-world"?

10:01.842 --> 10:04.109
Oh, my God,
you're so Gene jelly!

10:04.110 --> 10:05.678
You're a Gene jelly donut!

10:05.679 --> 10:07.446
No I'm not...!

10:07.447 --> 10:08.681
Fine, I am.

10:08.682 --> 10:10.082
Aw, okay.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.051
So to get Zeke back,
you have to remind him

10:12.052 --> 10:13.352
how fun you are
to hang out with.

10:13.353 --> 10:14.453
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:14.454 --> 10:15.621
Wait, like how?

10:15.622 --> 10:16.922
Find a five-butted goat.

10:16.923 --> 10:18.858
Yeah.

10:18.859 --> 10:20.226
I think it's an electric fence.

10:20.227 --> 10:21.427
Maybe to keep deer
out of the corn?

10:21.428 --> 10:22.428
Don't touch it.

10:22.429 --> 10:23.596
It's not an electric fence.

10:23.597 --> 10:24.730
It's just humming.

10:24.731 --> 10:25.731
Don't all fences do that?

10:25.732 --> 10:26.732
Rudy, touch it.

10:26.733 --> 10:27.867
No thank you.

10:27.868 --> 10:29.568
We can do this...
just carefully

10:29.569 --> 10:32.071
limbo through the wires and...

10:33.440 --> 10:35.107
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa.

10:35.108 --> 10:36.642
It didn't even hurt.

10:36.643 --> 10:37.943
Hey, I'm gonna pass the zap.

10:37.944 --> 10:39.078
Who wants some?

10:39.079 --> 10:40.412
Uh, I'll take a zap, Zeke!

10:42.148 --> 10:43.215
Gotcha!

10:43.216 --> 10:44.583
It tickles and it hurts

10:44.584 --> 10:45.985
and I pooped a little,
but it went back up!

10:45.986 --> 10:47.419
That's what I'm talking about!

10:47.420 --> 10:48.420
He gets it!

10:48.421 --> 10:49.421
Oh, man!

10:49.422 --> 10:50.656
Electricity was literally

10:50.657 --> 10:52.091
running between them.

10:52.092 --> 10:53.292
No, that was beautiful.

10:53.293 --> 10:54.560
I'm so happy to hear...
Shut up!

10:54.561 --> 10:55.728
Here's how you go through

10:55.729 --> 10:57.162
with the least
amount of contact.

10:58.732 --> 11:00.566
I got it! Nope!

11:00.567 --> 11:02.501
Seizing up!
Seizing up!

11:02.502 --> 11:04.003
<i>Maybe my destiny is Zeke.</i>

11:04.004 --> 11:05.437
<i>So brave.</i>

11:05.438 --> 11:07.640
Can you see my bones?
Are they glowing?

11:07.641 --> 11:08.741
<i>But not that bright.</i>

11:08.742 --> 11:09.775
We could just

11:09.776 --> 11:10.775
go through this gate.

11:10.810 --> 11:12.077
<i>Maybe it's Darryl.</i>

11:12.078 --> 11:13.077
<i>So smart.</i>

11:14.114 --> 11:15.514
The gate's too heavy!

11:15.515 --> 11:16.714
<i>Um, let's keep looking.</i>

11:16.750 --> 11:18.083
Anyone can walk through a gate!

11:18.084 --> 11:20.084
You're missing out!

11:22.856 --> 11:25.190
All right, door handle.

11:25.191 --> 11:26.992
All right!
Okay, Teddy.

11:26.993 --> 11:28.427
This is it.
Last shot.

11:28.428 --> 11:29.795
You have to make this
or Linda wins.

11:29.796 --> 11:31.797
I got this.

11:31.798 --> 11:32.798
Aah!

11:32.799 --> 11:33.799
Thanks a lot, Bob!

11:33.800 --> 11:34.867
What?
What did I do?

11:34.868 --> 11:36.268
You breathe too hard!

11:36.269 --> 11:37.536
I breathe too hard?

11:38.638 --> 11:39.672
That's you!

11:39.673 --> 11:40.673
Hey, calm down, Teddy.

11:40.674 --> 11:41.674
Don't you touch me!

11:41.675 --> 11:42.675
Teddy!

11:44.277 --> 11:45.611
Don't you see what's happening?

11:45.612 --> 11:47.212
She's turning us
against each other!

11:47.213 --> 11:48.480
You are!

11:48.481 --> 11:50.215
Oh, I am not.

11:50.216 --> 11:51.317
Teddy says that every day.

11:51.318 --> 11:52.384
You witch!
Okay!

11:52.385 --> 11:53.385
So, Mort's up next.

11:53.386 --> 11:54.386
Good luck, Mort.

11:54.387 --> 11:55.920
Maybe I'm not the guy...

11:55.956 --> 11:57.690
Go, Mort!
Uh...

11:57.691 --> 11:59.191
You're playing, Mort.
We're gonna keep playing

11:59.192 --> 12:00.326
until somebody beats her.

12:00.327 --> 12:01.660
I don't know.

12:01.661 --> 12:02.728
I've never been good
with napkins

12:02.729 --> 12:05.029
or toilet paper...
Gross.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.234
That was a pretty
lame cornfield, Gene.

12:09.235 --> 12:11.070
No mazes, no scarecrows...

12:11.071 --> 12:12.371
No children of it.

12:12.372 --> 12:13.806
Pretty good-looking
corn, though.

12:13.807 --> 12:16.542
And now we get to cross
a river on a dead tree.

12:16.543 --> 12:17.543
Like in the movies!

12:17.544 --> 12:18.544
That's fun.

12:18.545 --> 12:19.645
I like movies.

12:19.646 --> 12:20.980
Hold on, everyone.

12:20.981 --> 12:22.414
I think that's poison ivy.

12:22.415 --> 12:24.416
Uh-oh.
Great, first Gene's idea

12:24.417 --> 12:26.318
gives Zeke a twitch
he didn't used to have.

12:26.319 --> 12:28.320
It'll go away.

12:28.321 --> 12:30.222
And now we're
all gonna be itchy.

12:30.223 --> 12:31.323
I say we head back.

12:31.324 --> 12:32.524
Yeah, I heard poison ivy

12:32.525 --> 12:33.826
is really bad for your skin.

12:33.827 --> 12:35.694
What? No...

12:35.695 --> 12:36.829
I already have eczema.

12:36.830 --> 12:38.063
I don't even want to know

12:38.064 --> 12:39.198
what poison ivy will do to it.

12:39.199 --> 12:40.232
Okay, listen.

12:40.233 --> 12:42.067
If we keep going, it may be

12:42.068 --> 12:44.069
a risk to our smooth,
silky skin,

12:44.070 --> 12:46.005
but I say it's still worth it!

12:46.006 --> 12:48.607
Because we're talking
about a two-butted goat!

12:48.608 --> 12:51.844
Now, who will stand with me?!

12:51.845 --> 12:53.345
I'm actually done.
No way. Sorry, yeah.

12:53.346 --> 12:54.780
Not me, buddy.
I can't.

12:54.781 --> 12:56.048
I don't want to
risk my silky skin.

12:56.049 --> 12:57.082
Yeah, we're out, right Zeke?

12:57.083 --> 12:58.717
No way, J-Ju!

12:58.718 --> 13:00.019
If it's out there,
we have to try!

13:00.020 --> 13:01.920
I'm with you, Gene!

13:01.921 --> 13:03.122
Psst, go to him.

13:03.123 --> 13:04.189
Go!
Go!

13:05.225 --> 13:06.692
Fine, I'm coming.

13:06.693 --> 13:08.527
I'm in, too.
Sorry, feet.

13:08.528 --> 13:09.695
Oh, I'm going.

13:09.696 --> 13:11.196
I want to see your face

13:11.197 --> 13:12.731
when you see my face
laughing in your face

13:12.732 --> 13:14.533
when you don't see
a two-butted goat.

13:14.534 --> 13:15.901
And I have to see
what destiny awaits

13:15.902 --> 13:17.269
at the end of this journey.

13:17.270 --> 13:18.771
Settle down, Robert Frost.

13:18.772 --> 13:20.139
You guys won't regret
sticking with me.

13:20.140 --> 13:21.640
Darryl, Tammy, Jocelyn,

13:21.641 --> 13:23.442
you sure you don't
want to keep going?

13:23.443 --> 13:24.476
Oh, they're gone.

13:24.477 --> 13:25.811
Well the good news is

13:25.812 --> 13:27.613
the poison ivy
is easy to step over.

13:27.614 --> 13:29.314
Even with these
regular-sized legs.

13:29.315 --> 13:31.315
Yeah!
It's almost fun to step over.

13:35.476 --> 13:36.632
Nuts.

13:38.502 --> 13:40.914
Man, that poison ivy is thick.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.384
I knew I was gonna
get a rash today somehow.

13:43.385 --> 13:45.320
So, what do we do now, Gene?

13:45.321 --> 13:47.822
Well, I think if we could hop

13:47.823 --> 13:49.556
from rock to rock,
we could stay above it.

13:49.592 --> 13:51.960
God closes a door,
Gene notices a series of rocks.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.627
Let's do it!

13:53.662 --> 13:55.763
You have to remind him how fun
you are to hang out with.

13:55.764 --> 13:56.965
Yeah.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.032
Hey, Zeke!
Check this out!

13:59.068 --> 14:00.767
I'm David Lee Roth-in' it!
What?

14:00.803 --> 14:02.269
Panama!

14:02.304 --> 14:03.438
Whoa!
Didn't they have

14:03.439 --> 14:04.538
a song called "Jump"?

14:04.573 --> 14:05.906
Yeah, so what?

14:05.941 --> 14:07.574
Why not say <i> that</i> when you jump?

14:07.610 --> 14:09.010
I just...
I didn't think of it.

14:09.011 --> 14:10.345
Whatever.
You try it, Gene!

14:10.346 --> 14:13.046
Nah, I'm more of a Sammy Hagar.

14:13.082 --> 14:14.616
Hagar-in' it!

14:14.617 --> 14:16.216
That's fun!

14:16.252 --> 14:17.551
Hagar-in' it to destiny.

14:17.586 --> 14:18.586
Aah!

14:18.587 --> 14:20.554
I'm okay.

14:20.589 --> 14:22.490
Come on, let's go, Mort.
Come on.

14:22.491 --> 14:23.324
Oh!

14:23.325 --> 14:24.325
Oh, my God!

14:24.326 --> 14:25.493
Are you kidding me?

14:25.494 --> 14:26.527
Are you serious?!

14:26.528 --> 14:27.595
Should I close my eyes?

14:27.596 --> 14:28.929
Would that help?

14:28.964 --> 14:30.564
I'm starting to feel bad
for you guys.

14:30.599 --> 14:31.599
And under the leg

14:31.600 --> 14:33.801
to the bell above the door, aah!

14:33.802 --> 14:35.503
Oh, boy.
What's going on in here?

14:35.504 --> 14:36.537
Napkin darts?

14:36.538 --> 14:38.005
Yeah, we call it Narts.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.274
Cool, I like fun words.

14:39.275 --> 14:40.541
I got next.
Who's winning?

14:40.542 --> 14:42.043
Linda.
No one can beat her.

14:42.044 --> 14:43.478
She's like an evil Narts robot.

14:43.479 --> 14:44.712
She is the hoop-shoot champ.

14:44.713 --> 14:45.980
You told Mike you were

14:45.981 --> 14:47.448
the fourth-grade
hoop-shoot champ?

14:47.449 --> 14:48.950
No, I read about it.
You did?!

14:48.951 --> 14:50.618
No, she told me.
Oh, right.

14:50.619 --> 14:53.021
Anyway, I was a pitcher in
junior college, so, uh...

14:53.022 --> 14:54.455
Bring it, mailman!

14:54.456 --> 14:55.456
You'll-you'll be up after Mort.

14:55.457 --> 14:57.225
Which is... Mort, throw it.

14:57.226 --> 14:58.793
Right now.
Yep.

14:58.794 --> 15:00.495
Mike's up.
Beat her, Mike,

15:00.496 --> 15:01.896
and you get a free burger.

15:01.897 --> 15:04.831
But if I win,
I get free mail. Go!

15:04.867 --> 15:07.635
Uh-oh, no more rocks.

15:07.636 --> 15:09.803
And a lot more poison ivy.
Look!

15:09.838 --> 15:12.005
That's got to be the farm!

15:12.041 --> 15:14.542
But we can't get to it without
walking through poison ivy.

15:14.543 --> 15:16.643
Maybe we could swing
across on a vine.

15:16.679 --> 15:17.811
No.

15:17.846 --> 15:18.980
Well, Gene, we tried your idea

15:18.981 --> 15:20.415
and it was a gigantic failure.

15:20.416 --> 15:22.016
So, time to head back?

15:22.017 --> 15:24.252
No! Only one of us

15:24.253 --> 15:26.888
has to get poison ivy for us
all to see the two-butted goat.

15:26.889 --> 15:29.823
What do you mean
"only one of us"?

15:29.858 --> 15:33.393
One person gets it by carrying
the rest of us across.

15:33.429 --> 15:35.295
Oh. Oh, wow.

15:35.331 --> 15:37.665
And since this whole thing
was my idea,

15:37.666 --> 15:42.069
I think that person
should be... me?

15:42.104 --> 15:43.438
I'm all choking up over here.

15:43.439 --> 15:44.872
This guy's my hero.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.208
Come on, boy!

15:47.209 --> 15:48.675
Come on, boy!

15:51.013 --> 15:52.046
What I miss?

15:52.047 --> 15:53.715
It's still NAR to NAR.

15:53.716 --> 15:55.216
She'll slip up soon enough.

15:55.217 --> 15:56.350
Mike is our best hope.

15:56.385 --> 15:57.718
Flying burgers picture.

15:57.753 --> 15:58.953
- Yes!
- Nice one!

15:58.954 --> 16:00.020
Ha!

16:00.055 --> 16:01.122
Damn!

16:01.123 --> 16:02.557
Return to sender, baby!

16:02.558 --> 16:04.591
Get it... mail?

16:06.862 --> 16:07.895
So tired.

16:07.896 --> 16:09.830
Legs itch so much!

16:09.865 --> 16:11.766
Look at him...
sacrificing himself,

16:11.767 --> 16:13.267
so that we might live...

16:13.268 --> 16:14.936
to see a two-butted goat.

16:14.937 --> 16:17.271
Like a little, rashy Bruce
Willis in <i> Armageddon.</i>

16:17.272 --> 16:19.273
I can't believe we're about
to see it!

16:19.274 --> 16:20.808
Damn, I thought that was gone.

16:20.809 --> 16:22.410
It's all gonna be worth it!

16:22.411 --> 16:23.910
We're almost there.

16:23.946 --> 16:25.813
Oh, my God, please let there be
a two-butted goat!

16:25.814 --> 16:27.949
Please let there
be a two-butted goat!

16:27.950 --> 16:29.317
What, Gene?
Nothing!

16:29.318 --> 16:30.785
We're almost at the end
of our journey.

16:30.786 --> 16:32.220
My destiny is
going to be revealed.

16:32.221 --> 16:33.488
If it's a farmer,

16:33.489 --> 16:34.922
please let him be a teen farmer.

16:34.923 --> 16:36.324
What, Tina?

16:36.325 --> 16:38.358
I said please let him
be a teen farmer!

16:38.394 --> 16:40.261
Ta-da!

16:40.262 --> 16:42.963
A no-butted nothing!

16:44.433 --> 16:46.199
Wait! Look!

16:46.200 --> 16:49.807
Show us your butt!

16:50.942 --> 16:52.683
Here, goaty goaty goat!
Here, goaty goaty.

16:52.684 --> 16:54.180
Come on.
Come on, little fella!

16:54.181 --> 16:55.905
Come on.
Come on out, buddy, come on.

16:55.906 --> 16:57.603
Come out here so we can see
your butt! Nothing weird!

16:57.604 --> 16:59.516
I just can't take it anymore!

16:59.517 --> 17:00.984
Can you see it, Gene?

17:00.985 --> 17:01.985
Go!

17:01.986 --> 17:04.921
Yes! It's...

17:04.922 --> 17:06.256
It's...

17:06.257 --> 17:09.025
it's a one-butted goat!

17:09.026 --> 17:10.260
Oh.

17:10.261 --> 17:11.292
Ha!
Gah!

17:11.328 --> 17:13.429
I failed you all!

17:13.464 --> 17:14.464
Yeah, you did.

17:14.464 --> 17:15.964
I really believed.

17:15.965 --> 17:18.367
I hoped and I hoped
and then nope.

17:18.368 --> 17:20.537
I won the bet,
but I kind of wish I hadn't.

17:20.538 --> 17:22.472
I'm sorry, Gene.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.273
You deserved to see that goat.

17:24.275 --> 17:25.474
No, I didn't!

17:25.476 --> 17:26.709
There is no mystery!

17:26.710 --> 17:29.111
There is no magic in this world.

17:29.146 --> 17:31.448
I don't believe it.

17:31.449 --> 17:33.316
Oh, my God... Gene!

17:33.317 --> 17:35.018
Everything just has one butt.

17:35.019 --> 17:37.853
Nothing is special.
Gene, look!

17:37.888 --> 17:40.056
It's time for me
to grow up, I guess.

17:40.057 --> 17:41.323
Gene, Gene, Gene!
Turn around!

17:41.358 --> 17:43.225
What?!

17:44.462 --> 17:46.495
You're real?

17:46.530 --> 17:48.064
You're real!

17:48.065 --> 17:49.465
<i>Okay!</i>

17:49.500 --> 17:51.401
It's NART to NART.

17:51.402 --> 17:53.069
This could be
the final shot, Mike.

17:53.070 --> 17:54.336
You scared?

17:54.371 --> 17:55.572
Maybe if I make a really
big fart sound,

17:55.573 --> 17:57.307
she'll miss.
I doubt it.

17:57.308 --> 17:58.808
But if we both make one
at the same time,

17:58.809 --> 18:00.310
it might be loud enough.

18:00.311 --> 18:01.310
Let's do it.

18:01.345 --> 18:03.879
Okay, Mike, I call...

18:03.914 --> 18:05.148
the blade of the ceiling fan.

18:05.149 --> 18:06.149
Which blade?

18:06.150 --> 18:07.217
There's five of them.

18:07.218 --> 18:08.951
The one with the ketchup on it.

18:08.986 --> 18:10.546
How do you get ketchup
on a ceiling fan?

18:10.554 --> 18:11.553
Ready, Bob?

18:11.555 --> 18:13.223
Make it a good one.

18:13.224 --> 18:14.289
On three.

18:14.325 --> 18:15.858
One...

18:17.328 --> 18:18.827
Two...

18:18.863 --> 18:21.064
Oh, my God,
what's wrong with me?

18:21.065 --> 18:24.534
 Lin

18:24.535 --> 18:26.336
 Da...

18:26.337 --> 18:27.737
Three!

18:27.738 --> 18:29.038
Where were you?!

18:29.039 --> 18:30.206
Sorry, Teddy, I can't do it.

18:30.207 --> 18:32.074
That's my wife.

18:32.109 --> 18:33.842
And...

18:33.878 --> 18:35.177
got it!

18:35.212 --> 18:37.846
Linda, yes! Great shot!

18:37.882 --> 18:39.348
Wait, you're cheering for me?

18:39.383 --> 18:40.183
Uh-huh.

18:40.184 --> 18:43.085
And...

18:43.120 --> 18:44.687
Linda gets free mail.
Hooray!

18:44.688 --> 18:46.222
All right!

18:46.223 --> 18:48.057
Yes!
Linda wins!

18:48.058 --> 18:50.226
Here you go, Linda.
It's on me.

18:50.227 --> 18:52.094
Okay, that's it.
Tournament's over.

18:52.129 --> 18:54.230
Linda is the champion!
Ha!

18:54.231 --> 18:55.732
Lin, sorry
if I got a little bit...

18:55.733 --> 18:57.567
exactly the way you said I'd be.

18:57.568 --> 18:59.869
It's okay... it must be
annoying how good I am.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.437
It is.
One more time?

19:01.438 --> 19:02.472
Just for fun?

19:02.473 --> 19:03.473
Okay, just for fun.

19:03.474 --> 19:04.473
But we'll keep score.

19:04.475 --> 19:05.542
You're going down!

19:05.543 --> 19:07.143
I mean, sportsmanship.

19:07.144 --> 19:08.611
It's magnificent.

19:08.612 --> 19:09.812
Two tails and two anuses.

19:09.813 --> 19:11.748
Just like Noah's Ark.

19:11.749 --> 19:13.416
Poor Darryl
and Tammy and Jocelyn.

19:13.417 --> 19:14.918
They missed out.

19:14.919 --> 19:16.586
They'll never know.

19:16.587 --> 19:18.488
In hindsight, one of us
should've brought a camera.

19:18.489 --> 19:20.123
I'm sorry I doubted you, Gene.

19:20.124 --> 19:21.457
Me, too.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.358
I could stay here
and stare at this

19:23.394 --> 19:25.460
beautiful bastard's
butts forever.

19:25.496 --> 19:28.164
Hey, stay away from my goat!
Get off my land!

19:28.165 --> 19:30.065
He's not a teen.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.301
I'm kidding!

19:31.302 --> 19:32.669
Come on,
that's just a bit I do...

19:32.670 --> 19:34.137
"The mean, old farmer."

19:34.138 --> 19:35.971
Go ahead, you can pet
little Double Butt.

19:36.006 --> 19:37.973
We can?
Sure!

19:41.111 --> 19:42.278
Fart-mony!

19:42.279 --> 19:43.446
Oh, it stinks.

19:43.447 --> 19:44.646
Twice as much.

19:44.682 --> 19:46.482
Hey, Tina, there's

19:46.483 --> 19:47.750
something I have to tell you.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.419
<i>Oh, my God, is this it?</i>

19:49.420 --> 19:51.386
<i>Is he the one I'm truly
destined to be with?</i>

19:51.422 --> 19:52.789
Yes, Jimmy Jr.?

19:52.790 --> 19:54.757
You're standing in goat poop.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.826
I'm standing
in goat poop and...?

19:56.827 --> 19:58.294
That's it.

19:58.295 --> 20:00.163
I would just step out of it.

20:00.164 --> 20:01.431
I don't get it!
We went on a big journey,

20:01.432 --> 20:03.099
the two-butted goat was there,

20:03.100 --> 20:04.634
but the one destined to be

20:04.635 --> 20:06.035
my true love wasn't revealed.

20:06.036 --> 20:07.470
Tina, listen carefully.

20:07.471 --> 20:09.439
Life is a journey.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.274
Uh-huh?
That's all I got.

20:11.275 --> 20:12.942
I don't have advice.
I'm nine.

20:12.943 --> 20:14.143
No, I see what you're saying.

20:14.144 --> 20:15.545
Well, I'm not saying anything.

20:15.546 --> 20:17.480
Maybe my two-butted goat
is still out there.

20:17.481 --> 20:19.014
That's exactly what I'm saying.

20:19.049 --> 20:20.149
You really did it, Gene.

20:20.150 --> 20:21.651
You changed our lives.

20:21.652 --> 20:23.019
Yeah, come here, Gene...
Victory wrestle!

20:23.020 --> 20:24.287
Come on!
Come on!

20:24.288 --> 20:25.955
No!
I don't want to wrestle!

20:25.956 --> 20:28.992
My legs are itchy and my back
hurts from carrying you guys!

20:28.993 --> 20:30.192
I-I'll wrestle you, Zeke.

20:30.227 --> 20:31.294
That's right!

20:31.295 --> 20:32.495
That's my Wrestle Rascal!

20:32.496 --> 20:33.662
That's my Wrestle Rascal!

20:33.697 --> 20:34.696
Get over here!
Come on!

20:34.698 --> 20:36.165
I am!

20:36.166 --> 20:37.166
Assume the position, big boy!

20:37.167 --> 20:38.167
Ow, ow, Zeke, ow!

20:38.168 --> 20:39.168
I'm gonna flip you over.

20:39.169 --> 20:40.169
Flippin' you over.

20:40.170 --> 20:41.204
Ow, my head!

20:41.205 --> 20:42.505
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

20:42.506 --> 20:44.340
It was a perfect day, Gene.

20:44.341 --> 20:46.042
Yeah, I don't even care
that I lost the bet.

20:46.043 --> 20:47.910
It was worth it to see
a two-butted goat.

20:47.911 --> 20:49.545
You're welcome.

20:49.546 --> 20:51.980
Besides, how dirty
can the restaurant be?

20:52.617 --> 20:56.108
What the freak
happened in here?!

20:56.109 --> 20:59.356
 Two, two, two-butted goat

20:59.357 --> 21:02.224
 Two, two, two-butted goat...
