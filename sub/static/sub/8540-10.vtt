[indistinct chattering on radio]

00:14.362 --> 00:15.972
[Lisbon]
'Nice place!'

00:16.059 --> 00:18.192
Where does a baseball scout
get this kind of money?

00:18.279 --> 00:19.541
Barney Sloop?

00:19.628 --> 00:21.108
He's got 15 players
in the majors right now

00:21.195 --> 00:22.805
and a piece of
everything they make.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.198
A million-dollar
eye for talent.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.547
He spots 'em young
all over the world

00:25.634 --> 00:27.288
brings 'em here,
trains 'em.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.767
Gets 'em fat pro contracts.

00:28.854 --> 00:32.119
Hmm. So you played.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.904
I played a little.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.036
Pitcher?

00:36.123 --> 00:37.689
Controlling the action?

00:37.776 --> 00:39.256
A man with the ball?

00:39.343 --> 00:41.476
Ah, I stopped.

00:41.563 --> 00:44.044
Which you still have
unresolved bad feelings about.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.918
Yeah...now I see it.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.268
That's why you joined the gang.

00:51.355 --> 00:52.965
'Parents thought you
were wasting your time'

00:53.053 --> 00:56.056
so they made you quit
baseball, crushed your dream.

00:56.143 --> 00:59.276
You were angry about it, but you
couldn't express that directly

00:59.363 --> 01:01.974
so you joined a gang as
an outlet for all that anger.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.802
Actually, I tore my ACL.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.282
- Nice try.
- Uh.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.592
Meh. Parents.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.681
It's funny, isn't it?

01:12.768 --> 01:15.510
Big regrets in life
people keep to themselves.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.686
I don't know.
I tell people about you.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.296
- Nice one. A zinger.
- Mm.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.515
High and tight.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.300
[male #1]
'As close as we can tell'

01:23.387 --> 01:26.129
'the murder occurred
around 10:30 p.m.'

01:26.216 --> 01:28.044
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.351
Eh. No big mysteries,
weapon-wise.

01:31.482 --> 01:32.788
Looks like three or four blows.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.224
Rage killing.

01:34.311 --> 01:35.225
[Cho]
'The coroner estimates TOD'

01:35.312 --> 01:37.401
'around 10:30 last night.'

[male #2]
'You're here, finally.'

01:40.970 --> 01:42.798
Freddy Fitch, Barney's partner.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.495
I wanna know who
did this, quickly.

01:44.582 --> 01:48.108
Agent Lisbon.
This is Agent Cho. Jane.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.501
Anything you need, it's yours.

01:50.588 --> 01:53.069
- I can't believe it.
- This was his garden?

01:53.156 --> 01:55.680
His peace garden, he called it.

01:55.767 --> 01:58.901
A year or so ago he got
into all this Zenmalarkey.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.555
Who had access to this area?

02:00.642 --> 02:03.732
Everyone at the academy,
six players in residence

02:03.819 --> 02:05.734
family members, uh, staff.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.736
- We'll need a list.
- 'Sure, sure.'

02:07.823 --> 02:10.739
But trust me, n-no one
here w-w-would hurt Barney.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.132
You discovered the body?

02:12.219 --> 02:13.524
[Freddy]
'I was out of town yesterday.'

02:13.611 --> 02:15.004
'A high school clinic
in Portland.'

02:15.091 --> 02:16.440
'Flew back early this morning.'

02:16.527 --> 02:20.096
Came straight here,
found him like this. My God!

02:20.183 --> 02:24.100
[male #3]
'Run, run, run! Come on!
Work it, Scotty, work it!'

02:24.187 --> 02:27.451
[Lisbon]
'His body's still warm,
and they're training?'

02:27.538 --> 02:30.889
I said they could skip
the workout. They wouldn't.

02:30.976 --> 02:33.501
"Hold on to the dream."
That's what he told them.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.331
Barney was like
a father to these kids.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.897
- Pitching is legs!
- It's good, it's good..

02:38.984 --> 02:41.552
Look, dad, I'm ahead of you!

02:41.639 --> 02:43.641
Seems they have
their own fathers.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.948
Ah, these kids are minors.

02:46.035 --> 02:49.430
We bring the dads out to sign
off on deals, moral support.

02:52.041 --> 02:55.349
'Scotty Sinclair
and Snake Gallidos.'

02:55.436 --> 02:57.786
Five drooling
scouts coming today.

02:57.873 --> 03:00.092
Maybe now isn't
the best time.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.183
Barney set this up,
his last showcase.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.533
I'm gonna honor that.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.362
'It's what Barney would want.'

03:08.449 --> 03:12.148
I know you gotta talk to them.
It's your job, but please..

03:12.235 --> 03:13.889
Hey, we can let the kids
finish their practice.

03:13.976 --> 03:14.933
Let's take a look at his house.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.413
How do you know where it's at?

03:16.500 --> 03:20.200
'Cause this thing is
a map of his whole life.

03:21.113 --> 03:23.986
Work, garden, home.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.162
Zenmalarkey.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.513
[indistinct chattering]

03:29.600 --> 03:32.473
I don't expect it's much to look
at, a simple bed or a thing or..

03:32.560 --> 03:33.517
Oh!

03:36.390 --> 03:39.219
[theme music]

03:46.835 --> 03:49.664
Jane? Jane?

03:49.751 --> 03:51.318
Hey, you alright?

03:51.405 --> 03:53.276
- 'Jane?'
- I see it.

03:55.539 --> 03:59.282
- 'Cigarette case.'
- 'A cigarette case. Yes!'

03:59.369 --> 04:01.676
Yes! Very good.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.678
But..

04:03.765 --> 04:06.115
'...what's it made of, son?'

04:06.202 --> 04:09.771
What kind of
cigarette case, Patrick?

04:11.686 --> 04:13.340
'What would you say?'

04:13.427 --> 04:16.081
What's it made of?

04:16.168 --> 04:18.214
[chuckles]
Sterling silver.

04:19.433 --> 04:22.174
[laughing]

04:22.262 --> 04:27.092
Your sterling silver
cigarette case back, ma'am.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.573
- Next object would be--
- The cigarette case.

04:32.228 --> 04:35.666
It once belonged to someone
very, very close to you.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.887
That's right.

04:38.974 --> 04:42.369
Yes. The boy wonder sees all.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.806
'The next object, Patrick.'

04:44.893 --> 04:48.113
Someone who's passed on..

04:48.200 --> 04:51.203
...quite recently.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.814
Last month.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.859
Your grandfather.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.948
No.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.602
Your grandmother.

05:01.257 --> 05:03.520
She loves you.

05:03.607 --> 05:06.306
Very much.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.351
More than she
may have expressed.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.748
What the hell was that?

05:13.835 --> 05:16.011
Your grandmother
loves you very much?

05:16.098 --> 05:18.361
Well, did you see her face?

05:18.448 --> 05:21.843
- It was beautiful.
- No. It was a needless risk.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.758
An heirloom she
carries with her.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.150
That's a recent death.

05:25.237 --> 05:27.327
And she's too young
for dead parents.

05:27.414 --> 05:31.548
- So a grandparent.
- So what? I'd moved on.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.376
It's a double act, kid.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.986
You don't fly solo.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.553
Now you're always saying,
"when you're working strong

05:36.640 --> 05:37.989
work strong, be brave."

05:38.076 --> 05:40.818
Well, I was working
strong, and I was right.

05:40.905 --> 05:45.562
No...there is no right
if there's no payoff.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.912
This is show business,
not show art.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.571
Your stage clothes are
walking by themselves.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.181
Wash 'em good.

05:56.268 --> 05:59.184
[indistinct chattering]

06:01.883 --> 06:03.275
Hey!

06:04.929 --> 06:06.844
That private reading..

06:10.457 --> 06:12.850
...it came through.

06:12.937 --> 06:15.723
- You got it? When?
- Tomorrow.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.551
This is a big score, Patty.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.770
Big enough for us to
blow off this outfit

06:19.857 --> 06:21.206
step up in class

06:21.293 --> 06:24.166
and get ourselves
some new wheels even.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.865
Only one thing worries me.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.740
It's you, myboy.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.306
You up to it?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.091
Oh, you know I am.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.791
Of course, you are.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.837
The boy wonder sees all.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.191
Can you stand up?

06:52.803 --> 06:55.937
- Can you talk?
- Ouch.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.591
I was talking.

06:57.678 --> 07:00.463
- He needs to see a doctor.
- Yeah.

07:00.550 --> 07:04.119
Wow. I've never caught
a foul ball before.

07:04.206 --> 07:06.208
Technically, you still haven't.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.601
- Cho, you take him.
- Yeah.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.646
Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine.

07:09.733 --> 07:10.952
- How many fingers?
- Six.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.301
Haven't we got
a murder to solve?

07:12.388 --> 07:13.824
- You were unconscious.
- No, I wasn't.

07:13.911 --> 07:16.479
- Jane, you were.
- I was not.

07:16.566 --> 07:20.222
Your turn.
Okay, I'll see a doctor.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.746
- Uh, excuse me, doctor?
- Hmm?

07:24.748 --> 07:27.316
I know. Real-life patient.
I'm excited too.

07:29.623 --> 07:33.583
Barney lived simple.
All work, all the time, 24/7.

07:33.670 --> 07:36.281
Left his wife,
gave her the big house.

07:36.368 --> 07:39.589
A clean, simple life
that's all he wanted.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.286
- Barney was married?
- 'Still is.'

07:41.373 --> 07:42.766
[Freddy]
'Leslie, a piece of work.'

07:42.853 --> 07:44.986
'Like I said, he
moved out a year ago.'

07:46.422 --> 07:48.380
After their son died.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.734
He was three.
Choked on a balloon.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.388
'Leslie just fell apart.'

07:56.476 --> 07:59.653
'Angry at Barney, the whole
world, couldn't get past it.'

07:59.740 --> 08:02.569
I called her this morning
after I called you.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.875
She wouldn't even
pick up the phone.

08:04.962 --> 08:10.141
The way I see it...bad things
happen, and you deal with 'em.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.752
And Barney did?

08:11.839 --> 08:14.624
Uh, he put his head
down, went to work.

08:14.711 --> 08:19.194
Found Snake in the Dominican and
Scotty somewhere in-in Kansas.

08:19.281 --> 08:24.504
Meanwhile, Leslie is...stuck
living in a, in a world of hurt.

08:25.896 --> 08:29.509
Hmm. I feel it.

08:30.945 --> 08:33.207
Let's check
the wife, Leslie Sloop.

08:34.164 --> 08:36.080
[keyboard keys clacking]

08:38.082 --> 08:40.910
- Working.
- Okay.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.353
Drinking like a fish..

08:48.440 --> 08:50.530
...picking up strangers..

08:50.617 --> 08:52.880
...callin' Barney at all hours..

08:52.967 --> 08:54.359
...screamin'.

08:54.446 --> 08:57.188
I don't get that
kind of anger.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.321
Okay, her kid died.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.149
Is-is that gonna bring him back?

09:01.236 --> 09:03.368
You don't have kids.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.066
No, I don't.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.372
'Uh, the ballplayers
should be heading in.'

09:08.722 --> 09:09.897
With Barney dead,
I'm assuming

09:09.984 --> 09:11.072
that you get the, uh

09:11.159 --> 09:13.727
controlling interest
in the academy.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.990
- What's that got to do with it?
- Money.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.992
Traditionally a very
popular motive.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.124
Excuse me?

09:20.211 --> 09:21.430
I imagine these two
had their differences

09:21.517 --> 09:22.953
'the gold watch,
the Italian suit.'

09:23.040 --> 09:24.302
Oh, I'm sorry,
the Taiwanese suit

09:24.389 --> 09:25.739
made to look Italian.

09:27.392 --> 09:28.785
I don't have to listen to this.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.266
Not exactly emblems of
the clean, simple life.

09:31.353 --> 09:32.310
There was a culture clash, yeah?

09:32.397 --> 09:33.747
- No.
- Jane.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.357
Plus, what is it exactly

09:35.444 --> 09:37.011
you bring to the table?

09:37.098 --> 09:39.535
Barney was the brains,
the real scout, the star.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.537
I mean, the Sloop Academy.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.194
Jealousy, motive number two.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.283
I killed him.
I-I murdered my best friend.

09:48.370 --> 09:49.589
- Did you?
- Jane, come on.

09:49.676 --> 09:50.938
Get this jerk away from me.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.548
Seriously, get it
off your chest.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.855
- You'll feel a lot better.
- He was my friend!

09:54.942 --> 09:57.248
How did that feel, crushing your
friend's skull with that bat?

09:57.335 --> 10:00.121
- How did that feel?
- Hey, hey, hey.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.166
- Back off now.
- I'm just checking him out.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.820
And?

10:03.907 --> 10:06.910
Well, ambivalent
reading, to be honest.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.782
'Maybe he did it.
Maybe he didn't.'

10:08.869 --> 10:11.088
But one thing he does
understand, that's anger.

10:13.743 --> 10:16.441
No offense.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.443
[Freddy]
None taken, jerk.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.796
[sighs]
You think I can
skip these interviews?

10:22.883 --> 10:24.798
- Please.
- Thanks.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.155
[Lisbon]
'Scotty Sinclair?'

10:35.504 --> 10:37.419
Doc Sinclair. He's 17.

10:37.506 --> 10:39.421
You're talkin' to him,
you're talkin' to me.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.993
[instrumental music]

10:53.870 --> 10:56.830
[Snake]
'Two, maybe three months ago..'

10:56.917 --> 11:01.138
...I was having control
trouble, my slider.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.880
Mr. Sloop said I
needed to quiet my brain.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.232
We raked together in his garden.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.277
It worked.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.631
I would never hurt Mr. Sloop.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.590
He gave me everything.
He brought me here.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.507
He hooked me up with great
coaches, regular school.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.596
And money to live on?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.687
An advance, some kind
of endorsement deal?

11:27.774 --> 11:29.471
Got, like, ten free pairs.

11:32.169 --> 11:35.085
Which we're gonna have to pay
back if he blows this showcase.

11:35.172 --> 11:38.349
Barney cared. Okay?

11:38.436 --> 11:41.135
He taught us how to
handle money, invest it.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.355
He taught us how to handle life.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.880
Are we done yet?

11:46.967 --> 11:49.317
He's supposed to be
throwing right now.

11:49.404 --> 11:52.059
Right, yeah.
Got it. Thanks, Frank.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.105
Whew!

11:55.192 --> 11:58.282
Barney's life insurance payout,
twenty million dollars.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.503
Let me guess, sole
beneficiary Leslie Sloop.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.940
Twenty million.
That's a pretty good motive.

12:04.027 --> 12:07.117
For twenty million dollars
I'd kill you.

12:07.204 --> 12:10.468
- Oh, really?
- No, I mean, I'm kidding.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.644
- It was a joke.
- Huh.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.388
- Still the machine.
- Let's go see her.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.091
Someone needs parking lessons.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.096
Who are you?

12:29.183 --> 12:31.141
We're looking for Leslie Sloop.

12:31.228 --> 12:34.449
Bitch ain't here, man,
and I called the real cops.

12:34.536 --> 12:37.104
- Hey, man, what took you?
- Hey, Narcisco!

12:37.191 --> 12:39.149
- Wait. You know him?
- You don't?

12:39.236 --> 12:41.761
Narcisco Rubrero.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.588
Walk-off homer,
game one, world series?

12:43.675 --> 12:44.981
Huh. Well.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.027
Help us out, Narcisco.
Where is she?

12:47.114 --> 12:48.724
Let's go downtown
and get a statement.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.552
- 'Alright.'
- Hold on, you guys.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.772
- We got dibs here.
- She scratched my face.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.775
I think I'm bleedin'.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.560
Look, she smashes her car,
so she steals mine.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.605
- My Lamborghini.
- Where did she go?

13:02.912 --> 13:05.480
I got a gun in that car.
It's all legal.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.395
I got, like a,
got like a permit.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.876
- Narcisco, where is she?
- I don't know, man.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.878
She kept screaming
about her little angel.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.445
You know, she had to
see her little angel.

13:14.532 --> 13:15.969
The son, Michael.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.538
Hey. Hey! She stole my car!

13:20.625 --> 13:22.497
So take it up
with the real cops.

13:27.197 --> 13:29.634
Jane, Lisbon wants
us back at the office.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.472
Jane, wrong way.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.344
Jane!

13:43.431 --> 13:46.303
[instrumental music]

13:57.532 --> 13:58.838
What are you doing?

14:00.796 --> 14:03.712
[rustling]

14:03.799 --> 14:06.715
[music continues]

14:12.155 --> 14:14.679
They say there's no
seasons in California

14:14.766 --> 14:16.768
but that looks like fall.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.035
No, looks like
you need a doctor.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.558
I am kind of dizzy.

14:28.563 --> 14:31.435
[clapping]

14:31.522 --> 14:32.654
[male #4]
'One more time.'

14:32.741 --> 14:35.048
[clanging]

14:36.310 --> 14:39.400
[male #5]
'Okay, hotshot.'

14:39.487 --> 14:42.403
'Female, third in line.'

14:42.490 --> 14:43.404
[Jane]
'Okay.'

14:45.841 --> 14:49.889
New mom, recently married.
One of her first days out.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.372
He is gonna get
her a better ring.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.766
- Who is?
- Members only.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.597
[indistinct chattering]

15:02.684 --> 15:04.425
[Jane]
'They hadto get married.'

15:04.512 --> 15:06.166
[laughs]

15:07.471 --> 15:09.256
Yeah, that's my boy.

15:10.605 --> 15:13.434
You have x-ray eyes.
No doubt about it.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.311
Whew!

15:21.398 --> 15:25.011
- Jane?
- Hey.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.622
I'm okay.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.932
Whew!

15:36.152 --> 15:39.503
Snake and Scotty are about
to pitch. We can't miss that.

15:39.590 --> 15:43.507
Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry.
What did I do?

15:48.034 --> 15:48.991
[sobbing]

15:50.906 --> 15:52.038
Mrs. Sloop?

15:53.865 --> 15:55.476
I'm with my son.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.349
Mrs. Sloop, I'm sorry,
we need to talk to you

15:59.436 --> 16:00.742
about your husband.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.831
No, no. You need to go.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.616
Really, you do.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.230
Don't you see this is private?

16:13.581 --> 16:15.104
[dramatic music]

16:20.022 --> 16:21.284
I don't want to talk.

16:21.371 --> 16:26.246
I just...I just,
I want to end this.

16:26.333 --> 16:30.250
- Please, just leave me alone.
- I'm sorry. We can't do that.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.078
You have to. Please.

16:34.645 --> 16:39.476
Because I...I don't
know what else to do.

16:40.390 --> 16:41.783
Mrs. Sloop.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.872
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.222
I've never had children.

16:46.309 --> 16:48.572
I-I can't even begin
to imagine your loss.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.922
No. No, you can't.
So just stop.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.753
Please, just leave me alone.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.799
'Just stop talking.'

17:00.410 --> 17:02.804
I'm not going to stop. I can't.

17:05.762 --> 17:08.243
My sister, she
was just like you.

17:08.330 --> 17:10.855
I don't, I don't
want to hear this.

17:10.942 --> 17:14.598
She wanted it to
beover...for her.

17:17.165 --> 17:19.516
It was always about her.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.474
'She couldn't talk to me.'

17:21.561 --> 17:24.868
- About what?
- About anything.

17:24.955 --> 17:28.395
I'm her sister.
But she didn't.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.397
Not to me, not to anybody.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.097
She just ended it for her.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.535
I don't know what else to do.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.062
Give me the gun.

17:46.587 --> 17:47.936
Put it down.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.027
You don't wanna
do this. Not here.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.594
Give me the gun.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.382
[sobbing]
I'm so sorry, Michael.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.819
[Rigsby]
'It's okay.
Come on. It's okay.'

18:03.647 --> 18:06.128
[indistinct chattering]

18:07.303 --> 18:08.870
Not now. You know that.

18:10.393 --> 18:11.742
'Okay. Okay.'

18:13.527 --> 18:16.617
Look, I'm busy here.
Your brother's tryout is today.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.011
'No. No way.'

18:22.579 --> 18:23.798
Bye.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.540
[indistinct chattering]

18:27.976 --> 18:31.110
- Hey.
- That's my older boy.

18:31.197 --> 18:34.504
He's a pitcher,
just like Snake.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.419
He's just as good too.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.378
But he's 22.

18:38.465 --> 18:41.424
In baseball years,
he's an old man.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.600
Yeah, these pro teams, they
like 'em young these days.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.689
Like Snake.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.648
Plenty of time for improvement.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.870
[indistinct chattering]

18:52.957 --> 18:54.698
We caught a break.
The wife looks good for it.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.095
What was that? Was that a fork?

19:00.182 --> 19:02.880
- Did he just throw a forkball?
- It was a slider.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.578
We gotta go. Lisbon wants you
to take a look at the wife.

19:04.665 --> 19:07.581
"Slider?" You know,
I'm still a little dizzy.

19:09.322 --> 19:12.716
You go. Really,
I-I, I'll get a ride.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.675
People love
driving with me.

19:17.765 --> 19:20.246
Couldn't find sunflowers.

19:20.333 --> 19:23.031
'Not quite the same.'

19:23.118 --> 19:25.338
[Lisbon]
'Leslie, where
were you last night?'

19:25.425 --> 19:26.861
[Leslie]
'We went to the movies.'

19:26.948 --> 19:31.300
I don't...I don't
remember which one.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.259
You're not supposed to take
these when you're drinking.

19:33.346 --> 19:34.999
It was so loud.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.480
There were guns
and helicopters

19:37.567 --> 19:39.047
and people screaming.

19:39.134 --> 19:42.268
Ugh, there was
so much screaming.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.487
Darn. These are
supposed to keep me calm.

19:44.574 --> 19:47.403
[chuckles]
Just one a day.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.362
That's what the doctor said.
That'll do the trick.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.581
Leslie, did you go
and see Barney last night?

19:51.668 --> 19:53.540
To see Barney?

19:54.889 --> 19:58.893
Mr. Zen?Mr. Acceptance?

19:58.980 --> 20:00.155
[scoffs]

20:01.069 --> 20:02.984
Why would I do that?

20:05.595 --> 20:08.250
- 'Tell us about Narcisco.'
- Narcisco?

20:10.470 --> 20:11.906
Oh, yeah.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.951
[chuckles]

20:14.038 --> 20:16.432
He's one of Barney's players.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.695
'I sometimes slept
with those guys.'

20:18.782 --> 20:20.175
'Did you know that?'

20:20.262 --> 20:23.700
I did that sometimes...
to make him mad.

20:25.963 --> 20:28.139
He didn't even care.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.752
She's going around and around.

20:31.839 --> 20:34.972
But I think she's
gonna give it up.

20:35.059 --> 20:38.106
I thought you were, uh,
amazing out there today.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.239
I just, just wanted
to tell you that.

20:41.849 --> 20:44.678
Thank you, I guess.

20:44.765 --> 20:48.595
- Can I ask you something?
- I don't have a sister.

20:48.682 --> 20:49.857
No.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.946
I didn't remember one.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.427
It just...came out.

20:57.038 --> 20:59.432
[indistinct chattering]

20:59.519 --> 21:00.433
Come on.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.525
[indistinct chattering]

21:06.482 --> 21:07.396
Come on. Come on!

21:08.571 --> 21:11.270
Ah! What was that?

21:12.793 --> 21:15.361
Come on, Scotty!
What are you thinkin'?

21:15.448 --> 21:17.885
- 'Come on!'
- He gets down on him too much.

21:19.495 --> 21:22.542
- The boy can throw.
- Mmm. He can hit too.

21:22.629 --> 21:25.066
Last night in the cage,
he dinged me three times

21:25.153 --> 21:26.241
'off my slider.'

21:26.328 --> 21:28.025
Nobody touches my slider.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.027
That man is gonna
kill the golden goose.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.377
Scotty plays like this now.

21:31.464 --> 21:34.728
Imagine when he's
18 or 20 years old.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.947
He's only gonna get better.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.645
'It's amazing, huh?'

Hmm.

'I spent three long days
at that crummy hospital'

22:10.198 --> 22:12.287
And now..

'Leslie, we talked to
five bars near the beach.'

23:21.095 --> 23:22.183
Nothing.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.364
After the movies, I had
an argument with Narcisco

23:29.451 --> 23:31.018
and went to Barney's.

23:31.105 --> 23:32.715
[crying]

23:32.802 --> 23:37.154
He was sleeping...
in his garden.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.722
- He wouldn't even talk to me.
- Leslie.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.290
I'm his wife.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.075
I'm the mother of his child.
Shouldn't he talk to me?

23:53.214 --> 23:55.564
She was there that night,
but he was already dead?

23:55.651 --> 23:57.305
If they were at
a 10 o'clock movie, it adds up.

23:57.392 --> 23:58.480
She knew he was dead.

23:58.567 --> 24:01.004
That's what pushed
her over the edge.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.398
I didn't, I didn't kill him.

24:03.485 --> 24:06.270
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.055
What would I tell Michael?

24:10.187 --> 24:12.059
Mmm, you should let her go.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.714
Where? Even if she didn't
kill him, she needs help.

24:17.194 --> 24:18.544
Your pants are ripped.

24:18.631 --> 24:21.677
We found a witness
with immigration problems.

24:21.764 --> 24:24.593
A baseball player, he was
very angry with Mr. Sloop.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.988
- Yesterday afternoon?
- He was yelling. Loud.

24:28.075 --> 24:29.816
He say Mr. Sloop
was stealing.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.992
And Mr. Sloop,
he was very quiet.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.255
He was trying to walk away,
but the baseball player

24:34.342 --> 24:35.909
he followed him, very angry.

24:35.996 --> 24:37.432
That's it?

24:39.913 --> 24:42.393
Um, Mr. Sloop, he
went into his trailer.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.047
Then he come out
and he show him some papers.

24:44.134 --> 24:46.615
And then the baseball
player, he got quiet.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.095
And that's when I left.

24:48.182 --> 24:49.531
But he'd recognize
the player if he saw him again.

24:52.099 --> 24:54.014
- Yes.
- Mmm.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.759
[male #6]
'Alright, line up
facing the mirror.'

25:04.764 --> 25:06.766
It's the biggest day of their
lives. Don't you get that?

25:06.853 --> 25:09.769
Barney Sloop had his head
bashed in, Mr. Gallidos.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.553
Big day for him too.

25:15.165 --> 25:18.038
[instrumental music]

25:24.566 --> 25:26.873
[music continues]

25:28.744 --> 25:31.355
- Him.
- You sure?

25:31.442 --> 25:33.923
Him at the end.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.534
[male #3]
'It's just not true.'

25:35.621 --> 25:37.666
- Dad--
- Hey! I've got this!

25:40.843 --> 25:42.062
My boy doesn't lie.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.020
- If he said he didn't--
- I did.

25:46.196 --> 25:49.373
I went to see him, alright?
But, I mean, I didn't kill him.

25:49.460 --> 25:52.638
- What were you arguing about?
- I don't believe it.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.770
- You lied to me?
- Mr. Sinclair, please.

25:54.857 --> 25:57.338
Yeah. I'm sorry
to disappoint you, dad.

25:59.514 --> 26:02.430
What were you arguing about?
What did Barney steal?

26:02.517 --> 26:05.389
He's not saying one word
because we're leaving now.

26:05.476 --> 26:06.434
Mr. Fitch--

26:06.521 --> 26:07.522
Scotty had an argument

26:07.609 --> 26:09.524
with Barney hours before

26:09.611 --> 26:10.786
the murder.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.919
You got nothing to hold him on.

26:13.006 --> 26:14.485
Not yet.

26:16.792 --> 26:19.665
[instrumental music]

26:24.408 --> 26:26.933
[Lisbon]
'He had an argument with
Barney. He was angry.'

26:27.020 --> 26:28.717
He lied about it.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.719
Who's to say Scotty
didn't go back that night

26:30.806 --> 26:31.764
and kill the guy?

26:31.851 --> 26:33.243
The kid didn't do it.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.376
He was angry with his
dad, not with Sloop.

26:35.463 --> 26:38.161
If you think he did it,
then check the cameras.

26:38.248 --> 26:39.554
What camera?

26:39.641 --> 26:42.078
The baseball field cameras.

26:42.165 --> 26:43.471
Snake let slip
that he and Scotty

26:43.558 --> 26:44.515
were out there last night.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.082
Apparently, Scotty handled

26:46.169 --> 26:47.867
Snake's slider very well.

26:49.869 --> 26:52.523
- You sure you're alright?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.264
Security cam.

26:54.351 --> 26:57.093
Should be time-stamped.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.618
[Grace]
'The guy who manages
the multiplex in Castine City'

26:59.705 --> 27:01.968
he remembers a drunk
couple fighting in the lobby.

27:02.055 --> 27:04.144
The woman was screaming
about the movie being too loud.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.407
Ten o'clock show.
Sound familiar?

27:06.494 --> 27:08.627
Go and show him a picture
of Leslie and Narcisco.

27:08.714 --> 27:11.412
If he IDs them,
that lets them out too.

27:11.499 --> 27:13.936
We're clearing people. We're
supposed to be catching them.

27:14.023 --> 27:15.155
Mmm.

27:17.287 --> 27:18.462
[thud]

27:19.812 --> 27:20.900
[thud]

27:20.987 --> 27:22.249
[thud]

27:25.513 --> 27:27.776
[female #1]
'We've tried everything.'

27:27.863 --> 27:31.084
She finished her fourth
course of chemo last week.

27:32.955 --> 27:36.045
And then the, uh, t-tumors
in her lungs are growing.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.005
Cool shirt.

27:39.092 --> 27:41.572
[chuckles]
Thank you.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.358
[coughing]

27:44.445 --> 27:47.361
[hissing]

27:49.755 --> 27:52.453
[female #1]
'Now the doctors say
there's nothing they can do.'

27:52.540 --> 27:55.499
'Just...make her comfortable.'

27:55.586 --> 28:00.766
I know it...must be difficult.

28:00.853 --> 28:03.203
So when I heard
about the crystal..

28:03.290 --> 28:06.772
Ah, yes. The crystal.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.878
[instrumental music]

28:27.531 --> 28:29.142
Does it really work?

28:32.406 --> 28:33.973
Will it shrink the tumors?

28:36.236 --> 28:37.411
Observe.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.501
Decide for yourself.

28:42.285 --> 28:45.158
[music continues]

28:48.465 --> 28:50.337
- Patrick?
- Ahem.

28:53.688 --> 28:56.604
[music continues]

29:02.262 --> 29:03.437
Son?

29:05.961 --> 29:08.703
[music continues]

29:09.443 --> 29:11.706
I'm sorry.

29:11.793 --> 29:12.968
Patrick.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.756
What's wrong?

29:17.843 --> 29:21.847
Oh, he...it's
a stressful process.

29:23.152 --> 29:25.024
He just needs some air.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.462
Won't be long.

29:29.855 --> 29:30.986
[coughing]

29:32.466 --> 29:34.685
[indistinct chattering]

29:36.426 --> 29:38.602
- Get up and get back in there.
- I can't do it. I can't.

29:38.689 --> 29:42.128
Get up now. What part?

29:42.215 --> 29:45.218
Hmm? What part can't you do?

29:45.305 --> 29:48.395
The gag? That's easy.
I did the hard part.

29:48.482 --> 29:51.354
I put the money in the tent.
All you gotta do is pick it up.

29:51.441 --> 29:53.617
She's dying. Okay?

29:53.704 --> 29:55.968
We're stealing
from a dying girl.

29:56.055 --> 29:59.536
Okay. Yeah, we're all dying,
kid. Okay? We're all dying.

29:59.623 --> 30:00.842
But what we're giving her

30:00.929 --> 30:02.409
because, yeah, she'll
be dead by Tuesday

30:02.496 --> 30:06.065
and needs it more
than most ishope.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.762
Hmm? Do you get that?

30:07.849 --> 30:09.416
I can't do it.

30:11.766 --> 30:12.898
Okay.

30:14.464 --> 30:17.946
You're either with
the show, or you're not.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.730
You're a loser

30:19.818 --> 30:22.690
or you're someone
who plays the losers.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.953
And you can't just back
outwhen you feel like it

30:25.040 --> 30:27.913
when it's morally convenient,
when you don't have the guts.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.262
I've never backed out.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.699
I've been carrying
you for a long time.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.093
And it's not gettin'
any easier, son.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.356
No one likes
an aging boy psychic.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.793
Short pants don't look so good
on a kid that needs a shave.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.666
Now.

30:44.059 --> 30:47.454
You're gonna need
a new act. Mm.

30:47.541 --> 30:50.892
'You're gonna work that
out all by yourself?'

30:50.979 --> 30:52.938
'You going solo?'

30:53.025 --> 30:54.417
[laughing]

30:55.984 --> 30:58.160
Yes or no, boy?

30:58.247 --> 31:00.206
Are you with it?
Are you with me?

31:00.293 --> 31:02.425
Right now.
You gotta say. Come on.

31:10.042 --> 31:10.956
[clears throat]

31:18.659 --> 31:19.660
Seven twenty one.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.357
That's the last time we see 'em.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.359
Either one of them could
have gone back to Barney's.

31:25.057 --> 31:26.406
Where you going?

31:26.493 --> 31:28.364
Baseball academy
I was thinking.

31:28.451 --> 31:29.888
Don't we have
to solve this thing?

31:29.975 --> 31:31.106
Rigsby and Van Pelt are talking

31:31.193 --> 31:32.194
to the theater manager now.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.414
The wife? No, no. It wasn't her.

31:34.501 --> 31:35.937
The murder weapon
was a baseball bat.

31:36.024 --> 31:40.899
Baseball bat, baseball
academy, common sense.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.988
- Do you know who the killer is?
- What do you think?

31:43.075 --> 31:44.685
I think you said,
"what do you think?"

31:44.772 --> 31:46.339
to make me think you do
so I'll go with you

31:46.426 --> 31:47.862
'but really you don't.'

31:47.949 --> 31:50.212
[chuckles]
Cho?

31:50.299 --> 31:52.519
Baseball bat, baseball academy,
that's not common sense.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.260
Great. We'll all go.

31:56.436 --> 31:59.265
[instrumental music]

32:04.183 --> 32:05.401
[Freddy]
'Alright, fellas, fellas'

32:05.488 --> 32:06.837
'listen up here
a minute, please.'

32:06.925 --> 32:09.231
Before we start..

32:09.318 --> 32:12.017
...I just wanna say a few
words about Barney Sloop.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.456
He was a great partner..

32:16.543 --> 32:18.371
...a great friend to all of us

32:18.458 --> 32:21.156
and most of all...a great friend

32:21.243 --> 32:23.376
to the game of baseball itself.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.639
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.946
Let us bow our heads.

32:32.124 --> 32:34.082
Okay then.

32:34.169 --> 32:37.390
That brings us to Snake
Gallidos and Scotty Sinclair.

32:37.477 --> 32:40.219
'Barney's last and maybe
his greatest discoveries.'

32:40.306 --> 32:43.352
Two pitchers with
huge franchise potential.

32:43.439 --> 32:47.443
In a few minutes, guys...
you're gonna see the future.

32:47.530 --> 32:52.187
Meanwhile...grab
some food and a beer..

32:52.274 --> 32:54.668
...and make sure you've
brought your checkbooks.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.891
What are you doing here?

33:00.979 --> 33:03.068
Well, we thought you
might be relieved to know

33:03.155 --> 33:06.941
that we know you're
innocent, so...you can relax.

33:07.028 --> 33:09.422
Go out there and be great.

33:09.509 --> 33:12.077
- 'You're gonna be superstars.'
- That's right, baby.

33:12.164 --> 33:17.386
Women, cars, adulation, buckets
of money all there for you.

33:17.473 --> 33:20.041
So who cares if your dad steals
a little here and there, huh?

33:22.826 --> 33:24.785
- Hey, he didn't steal.
- Really?

33:26.830 --> 33:28.484
Yeah. He just set up
a new bank account.

33:28.571 --> 33:31.226
Oh. Oh.

33:31.313 --> 33:32.532
And that's what Barney told you

33:32.619 --> 33:33.794
when you went
over there to argue

33:33.881 --> 33:35.839
to, uh, accuse him of stealing.

33:35.926 --> 33:38.494
That your dad opened a new
account without telling you.

33:38.581 --> 33:39.887
I don't think you're
helping here, man.

33:39.974 --> 33:43.108
Yes, you two...
you have the gift.

33:43.195 --> 33:46.415
The question is this, what are
you gonna do with that gift?

33:48.504 --> 33:50.158
- Play baseball?
- That's right.

33:50.245 --> 33:51.507
You're gonna play baseball.

33:51.594 --> 33:52.595
You're gonna sell
soap, you're gonna

33:52.682 --> 33:53.944
be part of the big machine.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.294
No, no, no. Not soap, man.

33:55.381 --> 33:59.254
My own cologne.
"Snake. For men."

33:59.341 --> 34:01.735
- That sounds good.
- So we sell ourselves.

34:01.822 --> 34:03.432
I mean, what else
are we gonna do?

34:03.519 --> 34:04.955
Well, I'm just saying be careful

34:05.043 --> 34:08.002
that you sell your
talent and not your soul.

34:08.089 --> 34:10.438
Don't let other people run
your lives, not even your dads.

34:10.525 --> 34:12.659
And trust me, I know
what I'm talking about.

34:12.746 --> 34:13.920
Oh, yeah?

34:14.007 --> 34:15.096
[chuckles]

34:15.183 --> 34:16.793
What's your talent, old man?

34:16.880 --> 34:21.407
Me? Uh..

34:21.494 --> 34:23.148
I read minds, and there's been

34:23.235 --> 34:24.583
plenty of times
that I've misused that.

34:24.670 --> 34:27.500
Read minds, man? Get real.

34:27.587 --> 34:28.936
I am real.

34:29.023 --> 34:31.460
Just like most
people read books

34:31.547 --> 34:33.375
I...read minds.

34:33.462 --> 34:34.985
[snaps fingers]
Okay, what am I thinking?

34:35.072 --> 34:36.683
You're thinking,
"Holy crap, I hope he can't

34:36.770 --> 34:39.947
really read minds. Otherwise I'd
be in deep trouble right now."

34:40.034 --> 34:41.166
Right?

34:41.253 --> 34:43.559
[Snake and Scotty laughing]

34:43.646 --> 34:46.344
Okay. Cho, could you hand
me that pencil, please?

34:49.696 --> 34:51.437
Scotty, concentrate.

34:51.524 --> 34:53.656
Think of your birthday.
Don't tell me.

34:53.743 --> 34:56.485
Month, day, year. Concentrate.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.097
Alright. I'm doing it.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.489
He's messing with us, man.

35:00.576 --> 35:02.404
- 'Come on, we need to go--'
- Shh!

35:03.666 --> 35:05.277
I'm reading his mind.

35:07.888 --> 35:10.804
[instrumental music]

35:15.809 --> 35:18.333
Okay, got it.

35:18.420 --> 35:21.293
[music continues]

35:24.948 --> 35:27.081
What's your birthday, Scotty?

35:27.168 --> 35:30.389
- April 10th, '92.
- "April 10th, '92."

35:32.304 --> 35:35.002
Now how much money you wanna
bet that I can't read minds?

35:35.089 --> 35:37.570
'You're gonna be a big
shot baseball player'

35:37.657 --> 35:39.833
'make a lot of money.'

35:39.920 --> 35:41.922
How much of that money
are you willing to bet

35:42.009 --> 35:43.750
that I can't read minds?

35:43.837 --> 35:44.925
No way.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.883
Snake, you want
in on the action?

35:46.970 --> 35:49.321
Cho's not going near it.
He knows better.

35:49.408 --> 35:51.888
Show it to me.
No way. Come on. Show it.

35:53.803 --> 35:56.632
[music continues]

35:58.417 --> 36:02.203
- Okay, that's sick.
- Maybe he read it somewhere.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.684
Snake, it's my talent.

36:04.771 --> 36:09.341
You want to try? Your birthday.
Just think of it. It's okay.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.213
[chuckles]

36:12.300 --> 36:15.216
I got to warm up, man. Let's go.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.566
Alright. Maybe another time.

36:17.653 --> 36:19.351
- 'Good luck.'
- Thanks.

36:19.438 --> 36:21.396
- 'You too.'
- Thanks.

36:24.573 --> 36:25.531
What was that about?

36:25.618 --> 36:27.315
Just confirming a hunch.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.278
[sighs]

36:38.065 --> 36:40.241
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:40.328 --> 36:43.026
Just give me a minute,
I'll close this thing.

36:43.113 --> 36:45.942
- My dad hated baseball.
- You gotta get over that.

36:46.029 --> 36:48.118
Probably never would have
made the big leagues anyway.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.260
This crystal
is from ancient Egypt.

36:59.347 --> 37:02.785
'Its healing powers
are legendary.'

37:02.872 --> 37:06.441
'Where there is sickness...
it brings health.'

37:08.443 --> 37:10.402
This may be hard to watch.

37:12.752 --> 37:13.709
No. Don't.

37:13.796 --> 37:15.450
[coughing]

37:20.020 --> 37:21.978
And when the crystal
is applied..

37:23.980 --> 37:25.939
'...the burn is healed.'

37:26.983 --> 37:29.682
[instrumental music]

37:31.336 --> 37:34.121
The same thing
happens with the tumors.

37:34.208 --> 37:37.429
- They just disappear.
- I want it.

37:37.516 --> 37:40.083
Ma'am, we are here
for the next three days.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.694
You can have as many
appointments as you like.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.913
No!

37:44.000 --> 37:47.482
I want the crystal.
I want to buy it.

37:47.569 --> 37:50.137
Oh, that's not possible, ma'am.

37:50.224 --> 37:53.532
- I brought cash.
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.230
It's been in our family
for the past six generations.

37:56.317 --> 37:59.059
- 'I can't.'
- Please.

37:59.146 --> 38:00.626
I'm truly sorry, ma'am.

38:00.713 --> 38:03.193
Dad...she needs it.

38:08.851 --> 38:11.158
Just give it to her!

38:11.245 --> 38:12.420
Please!

38:14.292 --> 38:16.250
I'm begging you.

38:22.909 --> 38:26.129
[laughing]
Ten grand, my son.

38:26.216 --> 38:27.914
You were great in there.

38:28.001 --> 38:30.525
The crying, oh,
that was fantastic.

38:30.612 --> 38:32.484
I almost bought it myself.

38:35.356 --> 38:38.316
You earned this. Every penny.

38:41.493 --> 38:43.364
I'm gonna be
a little late tonight.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.540
'The sideshow boys got
a little poker going.'

38:45.627 --> 38:48.761
So, uh...wish me luck, hmm?

38:51.894 --> 38:54.288
[instrumental music]

38:55.333 --> 38:57.857
[bell ringing]

39:05.952 --> 39:09.434
Snake, you left before
I got to read your mind.

39:09.521 --> 39:11.827
What are you talking about?
Go away now. We got to focus.

39:11.914 --> 39:13.742
Oh, I was just trying
to get his date of birth.

39:13.829 --> 39:17.006
March 5th,'92. Okay? You happy?

39:18.181 --> 39:20.619
March 5th,'92. That's weird.

39:20.706 --> 39:24.753
I got the March 5th bit right,
but I got the, uh, year wrong.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.756
Never off by that much.
Mmm, five years.

39:29.236 --> 39:30.411
What are you doing?

39:30.498 --> 39:33.545
That would make you
22, 22 years old.

39:33.632 --> 39:34.981
Get out of here.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.809
That's the same age as
your brother, uh, Carlos.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.419
- That's his name, isn't it?
- Shut your mouth, man!

39:38.506 --> 39:40.856
- Get outta here!
- Take it easy.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.468
Barney found out,
didn't he? Yeah?

39:43.555 --> 39:46.819
He found out that Snake was 22.
He was gonna send him home.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.124
[whispering]
Shut your mouth, man.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.778
What the hell's going on here?

39:49.865 --> 39:53.521
Jupiter killed Barney
to conceal Snake's real age.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.654
Holy crap. Is this true?

39:58.352 --> 40:01.747
[Jupiter]
I tried to reason with him,
but he just walked away.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.009
[thud]

40:07.709 --> 40:09.276
- Papa?
- Don't say a word, Snake.

40:09.363 --> 40:12.714
No digas nada.
He doesn't know nothing.

40:12.801 --> 40:16.196
- Nothing about what?
- Holy crap.

40:16.283 --> 40:18.546
I...I didn't do nothing.
I'm not saying nothing.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.200
Oh, Jupiter, come on.
Let's be honest here.

40:20.287 --> 40:23.638
We'll let your kid throw.
Right, Mr. Fitch? Yeah?

40:25.858 --> 40:28.687
How old are you really,
kid? On the bible.

40:32.212 --> 40:33.822
Twenty two.

40:33.909 --> 40:36.172
Then you might have a shot.

40:36.259 --> 40:37.957
Middle reliever maybe.

40:39.828 --> 40:42.440
Double my cut, he can throw.

40:44.659 --> 40:46.052
Deal.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.054
Put your hands behind your back.

40:48.141 --> 40:50.012
You're under arrest for
the murder of Barney Sloop.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.931
- Dad.
- Man up, kid.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.933
Remember to keep the ball low.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.065
You get in trouble,
throw 'em the slider.

40:59.152 --> 41:00.501
[Cho]
Come on.

41:00.588 --> 41:03.461
[instrumental music]

41:08.509 --> 41:10.555
I just feel a little bit dizzy.

41:13.122 --> 41:16.299
I'm just gonna take a knee.

41:16.386 --> 41:17.475
I'm good.

41:19.389 --> 41:20.782
[male #3]
'Come on!'

41:25.047 --> 41:26.701
[male #7]
'Strike three. You're out.'

41:26.788 --> 41:30.792
- 'Nice pitch.'
- Yes! Ha ha.

41:30.879 --> 41:33.012
- Oh, you got lucky on that one.
- I-I struck him out.

41:33.099 --> 41:35.101
You set him up with the heater.

41:35.188 --> 41:38.452
You don't use it for an out,
not in that situation.

41:38.539 --> 41:39.758
I struck him out.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.890
We'll talk about this later.

41:44.197 --> 41:47.287
- I'm gonna make our deal.
- No. You won't.

41:48.941 --> 41:50.856
I hired an agent.

41:50.943 --> 41:53.685
[instrumental music]

42:02.128 --> 42:04.043
Let's go see a doctor.

42:04.130 --> 42:07.655
- Why? Are you feeling unwell?
- No, you are.

42:07.742 --> 42:11.006
- Cho said you almost fainted.
- Oh, I was just pretending.

42:11.093 --> 42:13.574
I hate these kind
of dramatic scenes. Poor kid.

42:13.661 --> 42:15.576
Liar. You just don't
wanna go to the doctor.

42:15.663 --> 42:17.012
Well, what's
a doctor gonna say?

42:17.099 --> 42:19.145
"You banged your head.
Be careful."

42:19.232 --> 42:20.973
- You might need an MRI.
- Oh.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.975
Now you're really
selling it. Sounds great.

42:24.759 --> 42:27.022
Are you okay?

42:27.109 --> 42:28.633
Just kidding.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.592
[instrumental music]

42:34.247 --> 42:36.423
[male narrator]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

42:39.948 --> 42:42.081
