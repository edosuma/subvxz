WEBVTT

00:12.375 --> 00:13.917
Dawson: SO THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH ME?

00:13.917 --> 00:15.333
Dr. Reiss:
EVERYTHING IS FINE, KIDDO.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.417
BLOOD, EKG, ALL NORMAL.

00:17.417 --> 00:18.834
ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

00:18.834 --> 00:20.750
I, UM...

00:20.750 --> 00:23.166
I'VE BEEN HAVING
THESE EPISODES.

00:23.166 --> 00:24.875
UH, WELL,
ATTACKS, REALLY...

00:24.875 --> 00:26.291
WHERE I GET
ALL SWEATY

00:26.291 --> 00:28.333
AND I FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA PASS OUT.

00:28.333 --> 00:30.625
HAVE YOU EVER PASSED OUT?

00:30.625 --> 00:32.040
NO, BUT...
I'VE COME CLOSE.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.417
HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN GOING ON?

00:34.417 --> 00:36.166
UM, A COUPLE
OF WEEKS.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.875
[SIGHS] DAWSON...

00:41.708 --> 00:44.208
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOUR FATHER DIED?

00:45.375 --> 00:45.917
ABOUT A MONTH.

00:45.917 --> 00:48.000
AM I GOING CRAZY?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.542
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY,
DAWSON.

00:49.542 --> 00:52.291
STRESS MANIFESTS ITSELF
IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS,

00:52.291 --> 00:55.667
AND ANYTHING AS SIGNIFICANT
AS THE LOSS OF A PARENT

00:55.667 --> 00:58.125
COULD EASILY TRIGGER
WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.250
I DON'T THINK
IT'S THAT, THOUGH.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.166
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT WAS...

01:02.041 --> 01:04.000
TOUGH, BUT I'VE
BEEN DEALING

01:04.000 --> 01:05.208
AS WELL AS
ANYONE COULD.

01:05.208 --> 01:08.250
WELL, THESE EPISODES
COULD BE HOW YOU'RE DEALING.

01:10.125 --> 01:13.959
LOOK, THIS--
THIS ISN'T MY AREA,

01:13.959 --> 01:15.041
BUT I KNOW A DOCTOR
IN BOSTON

01:15.041 --> 01:17.208
WHO I THINK
CAN HELP YOU.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.583
SHE SPECIALIZES
IN THINGS LIKE THIS...

01:19.583 --> 01:21.417
GRIEF, LOSS OF A LOVED ONE.

01:21.417 --> 01:21.792
YOU MEAN A SHRINK?

01:21.792 --> 01:22.500
YEAH.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.917
TRACY...

01:24.917 --> 01:27.333
DAWSON NEEDS TO SEE
DR. WEIR.

01:27.333 --> 01:29.083
WEIR IS THE BEST IN BOSTON.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.250
IS THERE
SOMEONE CLOSER?

01:31.250 --> 01:32.625
'CAUSE I REALLY
HAVE TO KIND OF
STAY NEAR MY MOM.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.375
THE ONLY OTHER PLACE
WOULD BE IN PROVIDENCE.

01:34.375 --> 01:35.625
LOOK...TRUST ME.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.458
WEIR IS WORTH THE TRIP.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.875
YOU'RE ALL SET.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.166
5:00 TOMORROW.

01:42.166 --> 01:44.417
Dr. Reiss:
GREAT. LET ME KNOW
HOW IT GOES.

01:44.417 --> 01:45.750
ALL RIGHT.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.000
THANKS.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.291
HEY.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.542
HEY.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.834
DO YOU NEED ME
TO TAKE YOU TO
THE HEALTH CENTER?

02:52.834 --> 02:54.375
WHAT? NO, WHY?

02:54.375 --> 02:55.500
YOU'RE CLEANING.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.166
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
I GET IT.

02:57.166 --> 02:58.333
THAT'S A JOKE, RIGHT?

02:58.333 --> 03:00.458
WOW. JOEY POTTER
MADE A JOKE.

03:00.458 --> 03:02.125
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE YOU
TO THE HEALTH CENTER.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.417
[LAUGHS]
SERIOUSLY...

03:03.417 --> 03:06.208
WHAT IS WITH THIS
MARTHA STEWART
ROUTINE?

03:06.208 --> 03:08.083
[SIGHS]
MY MOTHER.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.375
WHAT ABOUT HER?

03:09.375 --> 03:10.166
SHE'S IN TOWN
FOR A DAY,

03:10.166 --> 03:12.708
AND SHE'S COMING
TO VISIT.

03:12.708 --> 03:14.041
YOU MEAN I GET
TO MEET THE WOMAN

03:14.041 --> 03:15.333
RESPONSIBLE
FOR BRINGING YOU
INTO THIS WORLD?

03:15.333 --> 03:16.500
THIS SHOULD BE FUN.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.208
[SIGHS]

03:18.208 --> 03:19.291
OR NOT.

03:19.291 --> 03:20.959
NO, JOEY. NOT FUN.

03:20.959 --> 03:22.625
NOT EVEN A DISTANT
RELATIVE OF FUN.

03:22.625 --> 03:23.750
IN FACT, PROBABLY
ABOUT AS FAR DOWN

03:23.750 --> 03:25.166
ON THE FUN FAMILY TREE
AS YOU COULD POSSIBLY GET.

03:25.166 --> 03:27.959
SO I TAKE IT YOU TWO
HAVE SOME ISSUES.

03:27.959 --> 03:31.375
[SIGHS] YOU EVER SEEN
A LITTLE MOVIE CALLED
MOMMIE DEAREST?

03:31.375 --> 03:33.542
THIS WOMAN HAS, LIKE,
SYSTEMATICALLY DESTROYED
MY SELF-ESTEEM, OK?

03:33.542 --> 03:37.041
YOU DON'T STRIKE ME
AS LACKING SELF-ESTEEM.

03:37.041 --> 03:39.000
HA, WELL...
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.959
THIS TIME TOMORROW,
I'LL BE LIKE A SHADOW
OF MY FORMER SELF.

03:41.959 --> 03:43.583
I THINK YOU'RE
EXAGGERATING A BIT.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.875
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A WOMAN, HERE,

03:45.875 --> 03:47.750
SO SELF-INVOLVED
AND INSECURE

03:47.750 --> 03:49.291
THAT SHE USED TO BORROW
MY CLOTHES

03:49.291 --> 03:50.375
AND HIT ON MY BOYFRIENDS.

03:50.375 --> 03:53.375
SHE'S LIKE A MENACE
TO SOCIETY,

03:53.375 --> 03:55.667
AN ENEMY OF DAUGHTERS
EVERYWHERE.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.333
BRACE YOURSELF, JO.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.291
SOMETHING WICKED
THIS WAY COMES.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.375
DAWSON HASN'T CALLED,
HAS HE?

04:02.375 --> 04:04.417
LIKE I WOULD FORGET
TO TELL YOU.

04:06.542 --> 04:08.708
OK, RIGHT.
I PROBABLY WOULD.

04:08.708 --> 04:09.333
BUT NO, HE HASN'T.

04:13.041 --> 04:15.083
Jen, sighs:
"SHE'S MY SISTER?"

04:15.083 --> 04:16.125
HOW COULD I BE
SO STUPID?

04:16.125 --> 04:17.458
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
HIS SISTER.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.166
WELL, MAYBE SHE WAS
HIS SISTER,

04:19.166 --> 04:20.416
BUT THE OTHER GIRL?
NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

04:20.416 --> 04:22.417
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THEY HAD SOME SORT OF SICK

04:22.417 --> 04:24.750
FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC
THING GOING,

04:24.750 --> 04:25.917
WHICH, AT THIS POINT,
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T
PUT PAST HIM.

04:25.917 --> 04:26.917
MEN ARE SUCH DOGS.

04:26.917 --> 04:29.000
THAT WE ARE.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.166
NO, IT'D BE BETTER
IF THEY WENT UP TO YOU,

04:30.166 --> 04:31.542
SNIFFED YOUR BUTT,
AND PEED ON YOU,

04:31.542 --> 04:33.458
'CAUSE THEY'RE
GONNA DO IT ANYWAY,
METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.208
WHAT IS THIS?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.166
IT'S A LONG STORY.

04:37.166 --> 04:38.375
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST PART IS?

04:38.375 --> 04:39.583
I'VE BECOME A CLICHÉ.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.959
I MEAN, IS THERE ANYTHING
MORE TRITE

04:40.959 --> 04:43.708
THAN BLAMING
A CHEATING BOYFRIEND
ON THE WAYWARD NATURE OF MEN

04:43.708 --> 04:45.667
WHEN THE REAL CULPRIT HERE
IS--IT'S MY OWN NAIVETÉ.

04:45.667 --> 04:49.000
I THOUGHT THIS STUFF
WAS NORMALLY JACK'S
AREA OF EXPERTISE.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.542
JACK, WELL...
JACK, I HAVEN'T
SPOKEN TO IN WEEKS.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.125
HE'S TOO BUSY
GUZZLING BEER

04:53.125 --> 04:54.000
WITH HIS NEANDER-CREEP
FRAT BROTHERS.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.041
[LAUGHS] OK.

04:56.041 --> 04:58.083
WELL, THE WAY I SEE
THE SITUATION,

04:58.083 --> 04:58.875
YOU GOT 2 OPTIONS...

04:58.875 --> 04:59.792
YOU CAN EITHER
GET ANGRY,

04:59.792 --> 05:01.458
WHICH, CLEARLY,
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.417
OR?
OR YOU COULD
GET EVEN.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.834
MMM...

05:52.834 --> 05:54.959
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT THE ONLY FOOD

05:54.959 --> 05:56.917
THE EMPLOYEES WERE ALLOWED
TO EAT IN THIS RESTAURANT

05:56.917 --> 05:57.875
WAS THE STAFF MEAL.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.458
WELL, TODAY
IS MY DAY OFF,

05:59.458 --> 06:02.166
SO TECHNICALLY,
I'M NOT AN EMPLOYEE.

06:02.166 --> 06:04.000
WELL, THEN I MIGHT
HAVE TO CHARGE YOU.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.959
WITH WHAT?
POSSESSION OF
STOLEN BISQUE?

06:05.959 --> 06:07.333
HEH HEH...CLEVER.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.000
BUT IT'S NOT BISQUE,
IT'S CHOWDER.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.500
WELL, WHATEVER
IT IS, IT'S MINE.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.166
YOU JUST THINK YOU CAN HAVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT

06:14.166 --> 06:15.250
IN THIS RESTAURANT,
DON'T YOU?

06:15.250 --> 06:17.875
WELL, OBVIOUSLY NOT
WHATEVER  I WANT.

06:17.875 --> 06:20.250
[LAUGHS]

06:25.542 --> 06:26.708
HERE YOU GO,
WITTER.

06:26.708 --> 06:28.166
DON'T SPEND IT
ALL IN ONE PLACE.

06:28.166 --> 06:31.375
NOT ONLY DO I GET TO BE
THE SUBJECT OF YOUR
SCORN AND DERISION,

06:31.375 --> 06:33.708
BUT I GET PAID FOR IT.

06:33.708 --> 06:35.542
I FOUND THAT ON THE BOAT.

06:35.542 --> 06:36.041
I THINK YOUR WIFE
MUST'VE LEFT IT THERE.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.333
RIGHT, THANKS...

06:37.333 --> 06:40.750
WHICH REMINDS ME,
UH...

06:40.750 --> 06:43.041
SPEAKING OF THAT
BOAT OF YOURS...

06:43.041 --> 06:44.750
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT?

06:44.750 --> 06:46.792
HOW ABOUT LETTING
ME USE IT AGAIN
SOMETIME, LIKE...

06:47.250 --> 06:49.417
TONIGHT?

06:50.250 --> 06:51.208
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:51.208 --> 06:52.875
TONIGHT IS JUST NOT
A VERY GOOD NIGHT.

06:53.375 --> 06:54.959
PACEY, COME ON.

06:54.959 --> 06:55.875
HEY, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE NIGHT OFF.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.458
WELL, I ALREADY HAVE
THE NIGHT OFF.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.750
WELL, THEN, UH...

06:58.750 --> 07:00.625
THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOMETHING
THAT I CAN DO

07:00.625 --> 07:01.083
THAT'LL CHANGE
YOUR MIND.

07:01.083 --> 07:03.083
[LAUGHS]

07:03.083 --> 07:05.542
YOU KNOW...I'D LOVE
TO HELP YOU OUT,

07:05.542 --> 07:07.625
BUT I'M THROWING
THIS PARTY TONIGHT
FOR A FRIEND,

07:07.625 --> 07:08.708
SO I JUST CAN'T.

07:08.708 --> 07:09.834
Karen: HEAR THAT,
EVERYONE?

07:09.834 --> 07:11.417
PACEY'S THROWING
A PARTY TONIGHT.

07:11.417 --> 07:13.750
PARTY! WHOO!
ALL RIGHT!
YEAH!

07:15.041 --> 07:16.625
HEH HEH HEH.

07:38.083 --> 07:38.625
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

07:43.333 --> 07:44.291
HELLO?

07:44.291 --> 07:46.583
JOEY, HEY.
IT'S ME.

07:46.583 --> 07:49.041
DAWSON. HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

07:49.041 --> 07:50.583
UH, HEY...
I'M SORRY IT'S--

07:50.583 --> 07:52.291
IT'S TAKEN ME A WHILE
TO GET BACK TO YOU.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.667
I'VE BEEN, UH...
I'VE, YOU KNOW,

07:53.667 --> 07:54.917
HAD MY HANDS FULL
AROUND HERE.

07:54.917 --> 07:56.583
OH, THAT'S WHAT
I FIGURED, UM...

07:56.583 --> 07:57.583
HOW'VE YOU BEEN?

07:58.458 --> 08:01.792
UH, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN FINE...

08:01.792 --> 08:04.500
I GUESS...
YOU KNOW?

08:06.417 --> 08:08.166
DAWSON, UM...YOU CAN--

08:08.166 --> 08:09.500
SO, UH...

08:10.708 --> 08:12.875
LISTEN, I THINK
I MIGHT BE IN TOWN
THIS WEEKEND.

08:13.875 --> 08:14.917
REALLY? THAT'S GREAT, UM...

08:14.917 --> 08:16.041
DO YOU NEED
A PLACE TO STAY?

08:16.041 --> 08:18.041
NO, I'M GONNA--
I THINK I'M JUST
GONNA STAY

08:18.041 --> 08:19.083
WITH JACK AND JEN.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.750
OH, UM...

08:23.250 --> 08:24.667
IT'S PROBABLY JUST AS WELL.

08:24.667 --> 08:27.333
UH, AUDREY'S MOM
IS COMING INTO TOWN, SO...

08:27.333 --> 08:29.083
OH, OK. SO...

08:29.083 --> 08:29.667
YEAH.

08:30.917 --> 08:33.332
I...

08:33.332 --> 08:35.833
SO, HOW ABOUT I, UH...

08:35.833 --> 08:38.707
I'LL JUST--
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL
WHEN I GET INTO TOWN.

08:41.082 --> 08:42.750
SOUNDS GOOD.

08:43.958 --> 08:44.875
ALL RIGHT. BYE.

08:44.875 --> 08:47.250
BYE.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.291
FINE.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.000
LOOK. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

10:24.000 --> 10:24.959
IS IT ANY WONDER
THAT I HATE MYSELF?

10:24.959 --> 10:26.792
OH, YOU ARE SUCH
A DRAMA QUEEN, AUDREY.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.250
AH HA. RIGHT. THIS FROM
STELLA ADLER HERSELF.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.250
HELLO, DEAR.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.375
HI.

10:32.375 --> 10:33.750
JOEY, THIS
IS MY MOTHER.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.500
MOTHER, THIS
IS JOEY POTTER.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.750
OH, I HAVE HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU, DEAR.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.458
IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

10:39.458 --> 10:41.500
IT'S VERY NICE
MEETING YOU.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.792
OH, YOU HAVE SUCH
A CUTE LITTLE FIGURE.

10:43.792 --> 10:45.041
DID YOU EVER
DO ANY MODELING?

10:45.041 --> 10:46.834
UH, NO.

10:46.834 --> 10:48.792
IF YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY I WAS STANDING
ON THAT SCALE,

10:48.792 --> 10:50.542
IT'S BECAUSE
CRAZY WOMAN HERE

10:50.542 --> 10:51.792
THINKS I'VE GAINED
10 POUNDS.

10:51.792 --> 10:53.458
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I SAID, AUDREY.

10:53.458 --> 10:54.417
5, MAYBE.

10:54.417 --> 10:55.875
MOM, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA

10:55.875 --> 10:57.959
HOW LONG IT'S TAKEN
ME TO FEEL GOOD
ABOUT MY BODY?

10:57.959 --> 11:01.333
AND THERE'S NO REASON
YOU SHOULDN'T, SWEETIE.

11:01.333 --> 11:02.583
IT'S JUST A KNOWN FACT
THAT COLLEGE FRESHMEN

11:02.583 --> 11:05.542
TEND TO PACK ON
THE LBs.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.041
JOEY, HOW OLD
DO I LOOK TO YOU?

11:07.041 --> 11:08.333
OH!

11:08.333 --> 11:10.208
EXCUSE ME?

11:10.208 --> 11:11.208
OH, I'M PUTTING YOU
ON THE SPOT.

11:11.208 --> 11:13.792
I UNDERSTAND THIS.
ALLOW ME TO REPHRASE.

11:13.792 --> 11:14.625
DO I LOOK MORE LIKE
AUDREY'S MOTHER

11:14.625 --> 11:17.708
OR AUDREY'S SISTER?
BE HONEST.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.542
UH...

11:19.542 --> 11:21.000
[SIGHS]

11:22.917 --> 11:24.417
DEFINITELY AUDREY'S SISTER.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.333
EXACTLY. AND DO YOU KNOW
WHY THAT IS?

11:26.333 --> 11:28.500
BECAUSE I TAKE EXCELLENT
CARE OF MYSELF.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.792
YOUR BODY IS YOUR FRIEND
AND SHOULD BE TREATED
AS SUCH.

11:30.792 --> 11:31.667
OK, JUST SHOOT ME.
PLEASE?

11:31.667 --> 11:34.083
WILL YOU JUST
SHOOT ME RIGHT NOW?

11:34.083 --> 11:35.458
YOU MUST COME
TO DINNER WITH US.

11:35.458 --> 11:36.500
OH, UH...

11:36.500 --> 11:37.542

11:37.542 --> 11:39.667
JOEY? DID YOU
CHECK OUT

11:39.667 --> 11:40.708

IN THE BATHROOM?

11:40.708 --> 11:42.291
WHAT LEAK?
THE LEAK LEAK.

11:42.291 --> 11:44.333
I'M SORRY.

11:47.834 --> 11:50.208
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOLD HER SHE
LOOKS LIKE MY SISTER.

11:50.208 --> 11:51.667
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY?
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT,

11:51.667 --> 11:52.708
SHE DOES LOOK YOUNG.

11:52.708 --> 11:53.792
YEAH, THANKS TO HER
2 BEST FRIENDS,

11:53.792 --> 11:55.542
COLLAGEN AND BOTOX.

11:55.542 --> 11:56.792
JOEY, I CAN'T MAKE IT
THROUGH TONIGHT
ALONE WITH HER.

11:56.792 --> 11:58.583
YOU HAVE TO COME
WITH US TO DINNER.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.417
I CAN'T. I'M WAITING
FOR A CALL FROM DAWSON.

12:00.417 --> 12:01.834
YOU HAVE A CELL PHONE.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.166

TO GO OUT LATER.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.792
THAT'S LATER.

12:19.708 --> 12:21.041
WHAT ARE YOU

12:21.041 --> 12:22.417
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:22.417 --> 12:23.959
FIGURED I WOULD DROP BY,
SEE HOW YOU GUYS WERE DOING.

12:23.959 --> 12:26.708
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE
TOLD ME THAT YOU

12:26.708 --> 12:28.250
I WOULD'VE HAD GRAMS
BAKE YOU A CAKE.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.708
AH, THAT'S FINE.
SPEAKING OF GRAMS,

12:29.708 --> 12:30.542
DO YOU THINK SHE'D MIND

12:38.500 --> 12:39.792

13:48.708 --> 13:50.083
WELL, I THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA ROCK
MY WORLD TOMORROW.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.166
OH.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.959
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.834
I REALLY GOTTA

PALM PILOT THINGIES,

14:04.834 --> 14:06.959
KEEP TRACK OF ALL

14:16.667 --> 14:18.208
UH, ACTUALLY, JEN...

14:18.208 --> 14:19.917

14:26.208 --> 14:28.417
OK.

14:31.792 --> 14:33.708
I GET IT.
YOU DON'T WANT ME.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.875
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE
FOR A GIRL, CHARLIE?

14:37.875 --> 14:40.417
TO OFFER ONE'S SELF
AND BE REJECTED?

14:40.417 --> 14:42.000
IT'S HORRIBLE.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.834
COME ON. NO, NO, NO.

14:43.834 --> 14:45.500
IT'S JUST THAT
I HAVE THIS MIDTERM,

14:45.500 --> 14:47.333
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN
STARTED STUDYING.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.917
OK?

14:49.917 --> 14:51.083
I UNDERSTAND.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.542
I'M JUST GONNA

15:00.250 --> 15:02.542

15:02.542 --> 15:05.083
OH, RIGHT, UM...

15:05.083 --> 15:05.542
IT'S--IT'S NOT IN THERE.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.917
IT'S NOT?

15:08.708 --> 15:11.041
UH, IT'S AT THE DRY CLEANERS.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.667
[LAUGHS]
I HAD IT DRY-CLEANED.

15:13.667 --> 15:14.542
I'M REALLY GOOD LIKE THAT.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.917
OH...

15:16.917 --> 15:18.041
OK.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.083
WHO ARE YOU?

15:23.083 --> 15:24.834
I'M CHARLIE'S
GIRLFRIEND.
WHO ARE YOU?

15:24.834 --> 15:26.792
I'M CHARLIE'S GIRLFRIEND.

15:35.208 --> 15:36.875

DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!

16:04.583 --> 16:06.083
MMM. OH,

16:07.917 --> 16:09.166
THANKS.

16:10.792 --> 16:12.000
IS THAT A CREAM SAUCE?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.667
IT'S A DIJON.

16:14.291 --> 16:16.250
OH, LOOKS LIKE CREAM.

16:17.333 --> 16:18.625
HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING OUT?

16:18.625 --> 16:20.125
NO, MOTHER,
I HATE WORKING OUT.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.291
YOU KNOW THAT.

16:21.291 --> 16:23.125
WELL, I WALKED 6 MILES
IN THE SOFT SAND

16:23.125 --> 16:23.917
BEFORE GETTING
ON THE PLANE THIS MORNING.

16:23.917 --> 16:27.041
MY SCIATIC IS KILLING ME.

16:27.041 --> 16:27.291
THAT'S GREAT, MOM.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.834
ARE YOU BEING
SARCASTIC?

16:30.834 --> 16:32.542
IT WAS KIDDING.

16:32.542 --> 16:34.750
ARE YOU ASKING ME
OR TELLING ME,

16:34.750 --> 16:36.583
'CAUSE YOUR VOICE
GOES UP AT THE END

16:36.583 --> 16:37.500
LIKE IT'S A QUESTION,

16:37.500 --> 16:38.375
BUT I HAVE
A SNEAKING SUSPICION

16:38.375 --> 16:40.125
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR AN ANSWER.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.333
I THINK IT'S CALLED
UPTALKING.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.708
I WASN'T AWARE
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS DOING.

16:42.708 --> 16:45.291
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU
SOUND LIKE A...

16:45.291 --> 16:46.667
CALIFORNIA BLONDE.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.750
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
I HAVE TO...

16:53.750 --> 16:55.917
MAKE A PHONE CALL.

16:55.917 --> 16:56.208
SURE.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.000
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

17:33.166 --> 17:34.875
DAWSON.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.417
YOU READY?
ROUND 2, BROTHER.

17:38.708 --> 17:41.166
LET'S DO IT.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.458
I'M CURIOUS, CHARLIE.

17:59.458 --> 18:01.542
HOW EXACTLY DID YOU THINK
THAT YOU WERE GONNA
GET AWAY WITH THIS?

18:01.542 --> 18:02.708
GET AWAY WITH WHAT,
EXACTLY?

18:02.708 --> 18:04.917
HAVING YOUR CAKE
AND EATING IT, TOO.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.375
NOW, WHY IS
WHAT YOU JUST SAID
SO AROUSING TO ME?

18:07.375 --> 18:09.041
DON'T BE GLIB, CHARLIE.

18:09.041 --> 18:11.500
GLIB MAKES ME MAD.
GLIB MAKES ME WANT
TO SMASH

18:11.500 --> 18:13.583
SOME OF YOUR
VERY PRECIOUS VINYL.

18:13.583 --> 18:14.959
OK, OK.

18:14.959 --> 18:16.542
ALL RIGHT. LOOK,
GUYS, WE NEVER
HAD THAT TALK.

18:16.542 --> 18:17.708
WHAT TALK?

18:17.708 --> 18:18.834
WE NEVER DISCUSSED
COMMITMENT OF
ANY KIND.

18:18.834 --> 18:19.750
WHO NEVER DISCUSSED
COMMITMENT?

18:19.750 --> 18:21.834
YOU AND ME...

18:21.834 --> 18:23.375
AND YOU AND ME.

18:24.041 --> 18:25.333
LOOK, COME ON,
GUYS.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.625
THIS IS COLLEGE.
YOU KNOW HOW
IT IS.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.000
NO, TELL US, CHARLIE.
HOW IS IT?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.834
IT'S ABOUT MEETING
NEW PEOPLE...

18:32.834 --> 18:34.458
EXPERIENCING
NEW THINGS.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.625
LOOK, HERE'S
THE THING...

18:37.625 --> 18:38.417
ALL RIGHT,
I NEVER MEANT

18:38.417 --> 18:40.041
FOR ANY OF THIS
TO HAPPEN.

18:40.041 --> 18:41.041
I TRULY DIDN'T.

18:41.041 --> 18:41.750
I MET BOTH
OF YOU

18:41.750 --> 18:43.792
ON THE SAME
NIGHT

18:43.792 --> 18:44.708
AT THAT PARTY...

18:44.708 --> 18:46.458
AND THEN THIS STUFF
JUST HAPPENED.

18:46.458 --> 18:51.083
I MEAN,
THE ONLY THING I CAN
SAY AT THIS POINT...

18:51.875 --> 18:52.291
IS...

18:54.375 --> 18:55.875
I'M SORRY.

18:56.959 --> 18:59.125
I'M--I'M TRULY SORRY.

19:00.375 --> 19:03.041
I NEVER MEANT TO HURT
EITHER OF YOU.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.125
BUT CAN I MAKE
A SUGGESTION?

19:07.125 --> 19:08.125
YOU AND ME...

19:08.125 --> 19:09.917
AND ME AND YOU

19:09.917 --> 19:12.959
IS PRETTY MUCH OVER...
KAPUT.

19:12.959 --> 19:15.125
ALL RIGHT,
THIS MUCH I KNOW.

19:15.125 --> 19:18.083
WE CAN'T GO BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.500
BUT...

19:22.583 --> 19:24.750
WE CAN GO FORWARD.

19:27.542 --> 19:28.708
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:29.792 --> 19:32.166
I MEAN, LOOK AT
THE FACTS, ALL RIGHT?

19:32.166 --> 19:33.834
I LIKE YOU...

19:33.834 --> 19:36.375
AND, UH, I LIKE YOU...

19:36.375 --> 19:38.458
AND ONCE UPON A TIME,
YOU BOTH LIKED ME.

19:38.458 --> 19:40.125
ALL RIGHT?
SO I PROPOSE--

19:40.125 --> 19:42.000
TELL ME IF
I'M CRAZY, HERE--

19:42.000 --> 19:43.667
THAT, UM...

19:43.667 --> 19:45.291
WE ALL LIKE EACH OTHER
AT THE SAME TIME.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.166
SO...

19:51.166 --> 19:53.291
THEY'RE DOING
A PRODUCTION

19:53.291 --> 19:55.000
OF THE SEAGULL
AT SCHOOL.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.667
I'M THINKING
OF AUDITIONING.

19:56.667 --> 19:57.750
REALLY?

19:57.750 --> 19:59.125
THAT'S GREAT.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.333
DID AUDREY TELL YOU

20:00.333 --> 20:01.667
THAT SHE ACTED A BIT
AS A CHILD?

20:01.667 --> 20:03.125
YEAH, I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO RENT
THE MOVIE SHE WAS IN.

20:03.125 --> 20:06.208
YOU'RE NOT
MISSING MUCH.

20:06.208 --> 20:07.834
DO YOU MISS IT,
HONEY?

20:07.834 --> 20:08.583
NO.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.041
I CAN THINK OF
BETTER WAYS

20:10.041 --> 20:11.000
TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT MYSELF.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.500
WELL, I MISS IT.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.708
YOU WERE AN ACTRESS?

20:14.708 --> 20:16.667
MODEL, ACTRESS...
WHATEVER.

20:16.667 --> 20:18.375
SHE WAS THE GISÈLE
OF HER TIME.

20:18.375 --> 20:19.375
HARDLY.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.125
BUT, THERE WERE
A LOT OF SHOWS

20:21.125 --> 20:22.917
AND A COUPLE
OF COVERS
HERE AND THERE,

20:22.917 --> 20:25.291
BUT ACTING...

20:25.291 --> 20:27.041
THAT'S WHAT
I REALLY WANTED
FOR MYSELF.

20:27.041 --> 20:28.667
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY,

20:28.667 --> 20:30.625
YOU CAN SEE HER
IN AN OLD A-TEAM
EPISODE.

20:30.625 --> 20:34.208
ACTUALLY, I WAS UP
FOR A SCORSESE MOVIE
WHEN I FOUND OUT

20:34.208 --> 20:36.917
I WAS PREGNANT
WITH AUDREY.

20:36.917 --> 20:38.375
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
WHY SHE HATES ME...

20:38.375 --> 20:39.667
I RUINED HER CAREER.

20:39.667 --> 20:40.875
THAT'S NOT TRUE, DEAR.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.667
I WASN'T VERY GOOD.

20:42.667 --> 20:44.166
YOU, YOU WERE GOOD.

20:44.166 --> 20:45.125
I SUCK.

20:45.125 --> 20:46.750
YOU DO NOT, AUDREY.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.000
YOU JUST LACKED FOCUS.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.667
YOU KNOW, ACTING REQUIRES
A GREAT DEAL OF DISCIPLINE,

20:50.667 --> 20:52.250
SOMETHING YOU'VE
NEVER HAD.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.083
THAT'S NOT TRUE, MOM.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.083
AUDREY, PLEASE.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.417
SINCE YOU WERE
A LITTLE GIRL,

20:56.417 --> 21:00.417
FLITTING FROM ONE THING
TO THE NEXT--TOYS, BOYS,

21:00.417 --> 21:01.583
SCHOOLS.

21:01.583 --> 21:04.542
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY PRIVATE SCHOOLS

21:04.542 --> 21:05.917
AUDREY'S BEEN TO
IN THE LAST 4 YE--

21:05.917 --> 21:08.291
MOM, REALLY, I DON'T
THINK JOEY WANTS
TO HEAR ABOUT THIS.

21:08.291 --> 21:09.750
6! IN 4 YEARS,

21:09.750 --> 21:11.333
WHICH MUST BE
SOME KIND OF RECORD.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.917
EACH ONE ENDING
IN LURID SCANDAL.

21:13.917 --> 21:16.417
MOM? PLEASE, STOP.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING
ME.

21:16.417 --> 21:18.250
OH, I'M EMBARRASSING YOU?

21:19.166 --> 21:22.000
I'M SO SORRY, AUDREY, BUT...

21:22.000 --> 21:25.250
I DON'T REALLY THINK
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE EMBARRASSED,

21:25.250 --> 21:29.291
NOT UNTIL YOU HAVE TO
SHELL OUT A 6-FIGURE
DONATION TO SOME

21:29.291 --> 21:31.750
HOITY-TOITY
NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE

21:31.750 --> 21:33.166
JUST SO THEY'LL EVEN
CONSIDER YOUR DAUGHTER...

21:33.166 --> 21:37.708
WHOSE ACADEMIC RECORD
IS THE VERY DEFINITION
OF EMBARRASSING.

21:37.708 --> 21:40.959
YOU KNOW, THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE HERE
AT WORTHINGTON AT ALL

21:40.959 --> 21:42.291
IS A MIRACLE, AUDREY.

21:42.291 --> 21:47.125
YOU MIGHT LEARN
TO APPRECIATE IT.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.458
YOU KNOW WHAT, MRS. LIDDELL?

21:52.458 --> 21:53.834
KAY, PLEASE.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.792
YOU KNOW, KAY,
UM, I'VE SAT HERE
THIS ENTIRE MEAL

21:55.792 --> 21:59.625
AND LISTENED TO YOU
DO NOTHING BUT CUT
DOWN YOUR DAUGHTER.

21:59.625 --> 22:00.708
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE JUST
UPSET WITH HER

22:00.708 --> 22:03.792
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT
WHAT YOU WANT
HER TO BE,

22:03.792 --> 22:05.125
OR BECAUSE SHE'S 18
AND YOU'RE NOT.

22:05.125 --> 22:08.667
AUDREY MAY BE DRAMATIC,
BUT AT LEAST SHE'S
NEVER BORING.

22:08.667 --> 22:11.917
AND SHE MAY BE
INTERESTED IN A LOT
OF DIFFERENT THINGS,

22:11.917 --> 22:13.291
BUT THAT JUST
MAKES HER WELL-ROUNDED.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.625
AND AS FAR
AS DISCIPLINE GOES,

22:15.625 --> 22:19.000
SHE OBVIOUSLY
HAS A GREAT DEAL
BECAUSE NO MATTER

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
WHAT YOU SEEM
TO SAY TO HER,

22:20.000 --> 22:21.375
SHE SOMEHOW MANAGES
TO GRIN AND BEAR IT.

22:21.375 --> 22:25.291
AS YOU CAN SEE,
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
THAT KIND OF DISCIPLINE.

22:25.291 --> 22:28.208
AUDREY, LET'S GO.
THERE'S A PARTY.

22:38.250 --> 22:39.250
Jen: WHAT DO YOU
SAY, NORA?

22:39.250 --> 22:40.834
I'M GAME
IF YOU ARE, JEN.

22:40.834 --> 22:43.834
ALL RIGHT, SO,
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET
THIS PARTY STARTED?

22:44.333 --> 22:46.750
ALL RIGHT. UM...

22:48.000 --> 22:49.333
HERE'S WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

22:49.333 --> 22:52.917
YOU GO STAND UP
OVER THERE.

22:52.917 --> 22:56.583
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, BABY!

23:00.250 --> 23:03.959
ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT NOW?

23:03.959 --> 23:07.208
STRIP.

23:07.208 --> 23:10.000
YOU FIRST.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.208
YOU KNOW WHAT,
NORA, LET'S
LEAVE.

23:11.208 --> 23:13.041
YEAH, LET'S
GET OUT OF HERE.

23:13.041 --> 23:14.375
NO-NO-NO-NO-NO.

23:14.375 --> 23:16.333
DON'T GO.
DON'T GO.

23:16.333 --> 23:18.375
ALL RIGHT.
WHATEVER
YOU WANT.

23:18.375 --> 23:20.291
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GO FIRST.

23:21.417 --> 23:22.333
NEVER LET IT BE SAID
THAT CHARLIE TODD

23:22.333 --> 23:24.542
WAS LACKING
IN CHIVALRY.

23:28.291 --> 23:29.750
OOH.

23:31.417 --> 23:32.667
AH.

23:33.750 --> 23:35.792
OHH.

23:37.458 --> 23:40.959
OH, DON'T
STOP THERE.

23:45.750 --> 23:49.083
A-AHEM.

23:54.917 --> 23:57.959
OHH.

23:57.959 --> 23:59.875
MM.

24:02.875 --> 24:07.125
I DO BELIEVE
YOU HAVE ONE
GARMENT LEFT.

24:07.125 --> 24:10.542
UH-UH. SEE, NOW
IT'S YOUR TURN.

24:10.542 --> 24:14.750
OH, NO-NO-NO-NO.
CHARLIE, CHARLIE,
CHARLIE.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.750
THIS IS NOT
TIT FOR TAT HERE.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.125
MAKE NO MISTAKE--

24:18.125 --> 24:22.667
WE'RE HOLDING
THE CARDS. NOW...

24:22.667 --> 24:25.583
SHUT UP
AND GET NAKED.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.458
WHEW. OK. OK.

24:32.083 --> 24:32.708
IT'S NOT
SOMETHING BOTH
YOU GIRLS

24:32.708 --> 24:33.667
AIN'T SEEN
BEFORE.

24:48.250 --> 24:49.875
OH, YES.

24:53.917 --> 24:54.917
YOU READY?

24:54.917 --> 24:56.667
YOU BET.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.041
OK.

24:59.750 --> 25:02.083
NOW, YOU,

25:02.083 --> 25:04.834
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

25:04.834 --> 25:06.792
WHY?

25:06.792 --> 25:09.041
BECAUSE IT'S
OUR TURN, SILLY.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.375
WE'RE SHY.

25:11.375 --> 25:13.375
GOD, THIS
IS SO COOL.

25:13.375 --> 25:17.625
MM-HMM, LOOKIN' GOOD.

25:17.625 --> 25:18.834
SO GOOD.

25:18.834 --> 25:20.667
LOOKIN' GOOD, BABY.

25:20.667 --> 25:22.041
MOVE ALL THE WAY BACK.

25:23.250 --> 25:26.083
OOH. WOW.

25:26.083 --> 25:28.083
YOU READY
FOR US, CHARLIE?

25:28.083 --> 25:30.000
OH, YEAH.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.083
HEY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

25:32.083 --> 25:34.708
HEY, COME ON!

25:34.708 --> 25:36.834
HEY, GET BACK
HERE. ARE YOU
LISTENIN' TO ME?

25:36.834 --> 25:38.583
BYE, CHARLIE.
BYE, CHARLIE.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.583
HEY, THE TWO
OF YOU, GET
BACK HERE!

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
HEY, COME ON.
MOVE IT ALONG.
NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.291
[JEN AND NORA LAUGH]

25:49.291 --> 25:53.041
HOW AWESOME IS THAT?

25:53.041 --> 25:55.917
YOU'RE A GENIUS,
JEN. I'M SO GLAD YOU
TALKED ME INTO THAT.

25:55.917 --> 25:58.083
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THAT HE THOUGHT
THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY

25:58.083 --> 25:58.792
TALK US INTO
A THREESOME?

25:58.792 --> 26:01.041
I--I MEAN,
NO OFFENSE,

26:01.041 --> 26:02.291
YOU'RE REALLY
BEAUTIFUL.

26:02.291 --> 26:03.083
IT'S JUST
NOT MY SCENE.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.375
NONE TAKEN.

26:04.375 --> 26:06.000
AND YOU, TOO, BEAUTIFUL.
VERY MUCH SO.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.959
YEAH.

26:07.959 --> 26:10.542
WELL, ALL IN ALL,
IT WAS A PRETTY
PRICELESS MOMENT.

26:10.542 --> 26:11.500
NOT QUIET
AS PRICELESS,
HOWEVER,

26:11.500 --> 26:13.917
AS THE ONE
WHEN HE REALIZES

26:13.917 --> 26:17.208
THAT HIS AUTOGRAPHED
COPY OF PINKERTON
IS MISSING.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.542
KUDOS.

26:18.542 --> 26:21.083
CLASS NOTES
FOR ART HISTORY.

26:22.834 --> 26:23.291
MIDTERM'S ON MONDAY.

26:23.291 --> 26:25.583
BUMMER.

26:26.333 --> 26:27.834
HE LOVES THAT SHIRT.

26:27.834 --> 26:30.458
AND WHEN I GET HOME,
I'M GOING TO CLEAN
MY TOILET WITH IT.

26:31.875 --> 26:35.333
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...

26:35.333 --> 26:36.750
I KNEW IT WAS TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE,

26:36.750 --> 26:39.542
THAT I COULD ACTUALLY
MEET A GUY THAT WAS BOTH
CUTE AND HONEST.

26:39.542 --> 26:40.875
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

26:40.875 --> 26:42.583
YEAH, I KNOW. WELL,

26:42.583 --> 26:44.792
IF IT MAKES
YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,
I THOUGHT IT, TOO.

26:46.708 --> 26:50.750
LISTEN, UM, A FRIEND
OF MINE IS HAVING
A PARTY...

26:50.750 --> 26:52.708
DO YOU WANNA COME?

26:52.708 --> 26:55.417
HMM, THANKS. I THINK
I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK
TO MY DORM,

26:55.417 --> 26:57.792
LISTEN TO SOME MUSIC,
AND TRY TO CONVINCE MYSELF

26:57.792 --> 26:59.250
THAT BEING ALONE
DOESN'T SUCK.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.166
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S ACTUALLY
NOT A BAD IDEA.

27:01.166 --> 27:02.792
BUT WE SHOULD
HANG OUT SOMETIME.

27:02.792 --> 27:05.542
YEAH, THAT'D
BE GOOD.

27:08.750 --> 27:11.166
BYE.

27:25.750 --> 27:26.959
HEY, THANKS.

27:26.959 --> 27:27.959
YOU'RE WELCOME.

27:29.041 --> 27:31.500
THIS BOAT KICKS SOME
SERIOUS ASS, YOU KNOW?

27:31.500 --> 27:34.500
THAT IT DOES. AND ONE
DAY, I HOPE TO HAVE ONE
JUST LIKE IT.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.625
BUT, IN THE MEANTIME,
I MEAN,

27:36.625 --> 27:38.291
IT MUST BE QUITE
THE CHICK MAGNET.

27:38.291 --> 27:39.959
YOU KNOW,
I RESENT THAT.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.667
CAN'T A GUY
JUST LOVE ALL
THINGS NAUTICAL?

27:41.667 --> 27:45.083
TELL ME SOMETHING,
THIS WHOLE LATTER DAY
HEMINGWAY THING,

27:45.083 --> 27:46.291
DOES IT REALLY
WORK FOR YOU?

27:46.291 --> 27:47.750
Joey: HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING?

27:47.750 --> 27:49.500
OH, YOUR ROOMMATE'S
HITTIN' ON ME.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.583
AM NOT!

27:50.583 --> 27:51.625
YOU ARE, TOO.

27:51.625 --> 27:52.667
YOU WISH.

27:52.667 --> 27:53.917
HEY, I JUST CALL 'EM
LIKE I SEE 'EM, LADY.

27:53.917 --> 27:56.000
YOU BETTER WATCH IT
'CAUSE I MIGHT JUST

27:56.000 --> 27:59.166
HAVE TO PUT A HOLE
IN YOUR BOAT LATER
OR SOMETHING.

27:59.166 --> 28:01.375
[PACEY LAUGHS]

28:01.375 --> 28:03.333
I HAVE NO WORDS.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.667
NEITHER DO I.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.000
DID YOU TALK
TO DAWSON TODAY?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.333
NO. HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO CALL ME
WHEN HE GOT IN,

28:09.333 --> 28:10.834
BUT I HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM HIM.

28:10.834 --> 28:12.500
ME NEITHER. I CALLED HIM
ABOUT THE PARTY. HE NEVER
CALLED ME BACK.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.458
I HOPE HE'S OK.

28:14.458 --> 28:18.291

YOU GOT HIM DRUNK?

28:48.792 --> 28:51.000
YEAH, HE HAD A FEW BEERS
AT THE HOUSE. WHY?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.208
WELL, I KINDA THOUGHT
THAT THE OBJECTIVE

28:52.208 --> 28:53.708
WAS TO MAKE HIM
FEEL BETTER SOBER.

28:53.708 --> 28:55.041
I KINDA THOUGHT
THE OBJECT HERE

28:55.041 --> 28:56.750
WAS TO MAKE HIM
FEEL BETTER, PERIOD.

28:56.750 --> 28:58.500

LOOK AT HIM.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.125

29:01.417 --> 29:03.250
I'D SAY HE'S
FEELING BETTER.

29:03.250 --> 29:05.291
I'D SAY HE'S HARDLY
FEELING ANYTHING

I'M AT THIS
PARTY HERE
ON PACEY'S BOAT,

29:42.750 --> 29:44.250
AND I WISH
YOU WERE HERE.
YOU'RE NOT HERE.

IT SUCKS THAT
YOU'RE NOT HERE.

TO CALL YOU,

AND I'M SO SORRY
I DIDN'T CALL YOU.
I MEANT TO,

YOU KNOW WHAT?
I COULDN'T.

29:52.041 --> 29:55.917
I JUST, I COULDN'T
CALL YOU. DOES
THAT MAKE ANY--

29:55.917 --> 29:57.125
DOES THAT MAKE
ANY SENSE? AM I
MAKING SENSE,

29:57.125 --> 29:58.291
OR AM I JUST
RAMBLING ON LIKE
A DRUNKEN IDIOT

29:58.291 --> 30:00.959
ON YOUR MACHINE?
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
I'M DOING.

30:00.959 --> 30:01.917
BUT THAT'S OK.

30:01.917 --> 30:04.750
BECAUSE YOU LEFT ME

I PROBABLY WOULD'VE
GONE BACK TO L.A.

ACTUALLY, I WOULD
PROBABLY STILL

30:09.291 --> 30:10.291
BE THERE RIGHT NOW.

30:10.291 --> 30:11.708
AND MAYBE MY DAD
WOULD STILL
BE ALIVE.

IT'S SAUERKRAUT JUICE,
HONEY, AND A SPLASH
OF TABASCO.

30:58.834 --> 31:00.500
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.500
YES IT IS.
BUT IT'LL MAKE
YOU FEEL BETTER.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.125

THE RESTAURANT
SWEAR BY IT.

31:03.125 --> 31:06.000
OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

IS NO REFLECTION
ON HOW YOU ACTED.
