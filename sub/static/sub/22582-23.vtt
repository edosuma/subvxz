00:21.569 --> 00:23.560
I think this is the place.

00:42.969 --> 00:44.641
Take a look around.

00:58.249 --> 00:59.568
Over here!

01:20.569 --> 01:23.129
It's been a long road

01:25.889 --> 01:27.925
Gettin' from there to here

01:28.049 --> 01:30.847
It's been a long time

01:31.649 --> 01:35.119
But my time is finally near

01:35.609 --> 01:38.999
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:39.849 --> 01:42.682
I will touch the sky

01:43.089 --> 01:46.718
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:46.849 --> 01:49.841
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:49.969 --> 01:54.247
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:54.409 --> 01:57.481
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:57.609 --> 02:01.761
I've got faith to believe

02:01.889 --> 02:04.847
I can do anything

02:04.969 --> 02:08.678
I've got strength of the soul

02:09.288 --> 02:12.281
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:12.409 --> 02:16.607
I can reach any star

02:17.769 --> 02:19.760
I've got faith

02:21.609 --> 02:24.726
I've got faith

02:25.289 --> 02:28.565
Faith of the heart

02:41.529 --> 02:45.044
Definitely humanoid,
but I don't recognise the species.

02:45.369 --> 02:47.007
Seems very well preserved.

02:47.129 --> 02:49.882
Getting him out of here
is going to be a delicate operation.

02:50.049 --> 02:51.164
Drake to Arctic One.

02:51.289 --> 02:52.324
Go ahead.

02:52.489 --> 02:54.559
Set up a base camp.
Get Alpha team started.

02:55.809 --> 02:56.764
Acknowledged.

02:56.889 --> 02:58.402
Contact Starfleet.

02:58.849 --> 03:01.283
Tell Commander Williams he
owes me a bottle of Scotch.

03:01.409 --> 03:02.478
Sir?

03:02.609 --> 03:05.169
He'll know what it means. Drake out.

03:05.529 --> 03:09.283
I'm picking up the EM traces a few
dozen metres under the glacier.

03:09.609 --> 03:11.918
There's a lot more here
than we're seeing.

03:31.609 --> 03:33.406
We've got another one!

03:56.409 --> 03:57.808
I give up. What is it?

03:57.929 --> 03:59.521
An arm. It's his.

04:02.049 --> 04:03.118
You're joking.

04:03.329 --> 04:04.728
From what I can tell...

04:04.849 --> 04:08.125
it was integrated into
his circulatory and nervous systems.

04:08.249 --> 04:11.639
He could probably operate it
like it was his own flesh and blood.

04:11.769 --> 04:16.000
I met a Vulcan scientist who wore
a prosthesis. He lost his forearm.

04:16.569 --> 04:19.720
It's pretty sophisticated,
but it doesn't compare to this.

04:19.849 --> 04:21.918
Take a look at the eyepiece.

04:23.009 --> 04:24.920
Judging by the optics...

04:25.569 --> 04:28.163
I'd say he could see
most of the EM spectrum.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.127
Did you run a genetic analysis?

04:30.249 --> 04:31.762
That's even more interesting.

04:33.289 --> 04:35.405
They don't have much in common.

04:35.529 --> 04:37.679
They belong to two different species.

04:37.809 --> 04:39.527
Transmit your findings to Starfleet.

04:39.649 --> 04:42.209
- They may find a match in the database.
- Right away.

04:42.329 --> 04:46.561
Sir, I've run every test in the book.
I still can't identify this alloy.

04:46.929 --> 04:48.078
What about this?

04:48.209 --> 04:51.804
I thought it was thermal damage,
until I found signs of antimatter residue.

04:51.929 --> 04:53.408
Maybe their warp drive overloaded.

04:53.529 --> 04:55.679
That could explain
why there's not much debris.

04:55.809 --> 04:58.323
- I did find some carbon traces.
- Could you date them?

04:58.449 --> 05:01.361
This debris has been here
for about 100 years.

05:21.329 --> 05:23.081
Take a look at this.

05:25.729 --> 05:29.563
Do you see those devices?
They're repairing the cell membranes.

05:29.889 --> 05:31.038
What are they?

05:31.169 --> 05:34.320
I believe you're looking
at a form of nanotechnology.

05:34.449 --> 05:36.838
I've found thousands of these
in both aliens.

05:36.969 --> 05:39.085
They're not just regenerating
the damaged tissue...

05:39.209 --> 05:41.325
they're repairing
the mechanical components as well.

05:41.449 --> 05:44.361
As far as I can tell,
this arm's as good as new.

05:45.089 --> 05:47.808
The Denobulans have experimented
with nanotechnology...

05:48.449 --> 05:50.565
but they have nothing like this.

05:51.249 --> 05:53.604
Maybe we should move the bodies
to Module 3...

05:53.729 --> 05:56.038
put them in cold storage
with the other samples.

05:56.169 --> 05:59.445
That way, we can examine them later,
under controlled conditions.

06:00.089 --> 06:03.320
Couldn't the bodies be damaged
if we freeze them again?

06:03.489 --> 06:05.241
I guess it's possible.

06:06.129 --> 06:09.565
Then we should leave them here.
Let the regeneration process continue.

06:09.689 --> 06:11.566
What if it revives more of their systems?

06:11.689 --> 06:13.680
We don't know anything
about this species.

06:13.809 --> 06:15.925
Or what they were doing here
100 years ago.

06:16.129 --> 06:18.199
There's no reason to assume
they're hostile.

06:18.809 --> 06:20.959
They don't exactly look friendly.

06:21.209 --> 06:23.769
Starfleet has asked us to find out
everything we can.

06:23.889 --> 06:26.881
Keep them here for now.
We'll see what happens.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.357
Anything?

06:38.049 --> 06:39.164
Plenty.

06:39.569 --> 06:40.922
You seem a little jumpy.

06:41.049 --> 06:44.166
Cybernetic corpses, digging through
frozen remains in the night...

06:44.289 --> 06:45.404
why would I be jumpy?

06:45.529 --> 06:47.918
I'd be more worried
about the polar bears.

06:48.049 --> 06:50.688
I've identified 22 fragments
of the outer hull.

06:50.809 --> 06:55.325
Each one has the same curvature.
I think this ship was a perfect sphere.

06:55.609 --> 06:56.598
How big?

06:56.729 --> 06:58.765
About 600 metres in diameter.

06:59.449 --> 07:02.361
The debris field could be a lot more
extensive than we thought.

07:02.489 --> 07:05.686
We might want to get
another excavation team out here.

07:06.409 --> 07:08.843
- What is it?
- A warp signature.

07:11.209 --> 07:12.801
Help me with this.

07:17.969 --> 07:20.767
Just what the doctor ordered. Thanks.

07:21.529 --> 07:23.167
How are your friends?

07:23.289 --> 07:25.280
A little on the quiet side.

07:25.729 --> 07:27.765
There's a broken heating unit
in Module 3.

07:27.889 --> 07:29.527
They've asked me to take a look.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.048
Will you be all right here?

07:31.169 --> 07:33.000
Go ahead. I'll be fine.

07:34.049 --> 07:35.164
Okay.

08:02.489 --> 08:03.638
Feeling better?

08:07.129 --> 08:10.758
Deuterium residue.
Might be some kind of warp coil?

08:11.049 --> 08:12.960
Seems too small for a ship this size.

08:13.209 --> 08:16.724
I'd like to bring it back to the lab,
take a closer look.

09:10.409 --> 09:11.444
Here.

09:17.529 --> 09:19.008
Get me a medical kit.

09:27.169 --> 09:29.922
Admiral, there's a problem
with the A-Six excavation team.

09:30.489 --> 09:33.686
The Science Council hasn't heard
from them in three days.

09:35.329 --> 09:37.081
Get a shuttle ready.

10:17.569 --> 10:21.562
The Admiral thinks they're humanoids
enhanced with technology.

10:23.329 --> 10:25.399
He believes they abducted
the research team.

10:25.969 --> 10:28.688
We're a long way from the Arctic.
What can we do?

10:28.889 --> 10:33.724
Earth tracking stations spotted the
transport leaving orbit at warp 3.9.

10:34.609 --> 10:35.837
That's impossible.

10:36.089 --> 10:37.966
Those transports can't exceed 1.4.

10:38.249 --> 10:41.366
I think it's safe to assume these
aliens reconfigured the engines...

10:41.489 --> 10:43.878
using technology from their own ship.

10:44.009 --> 10:46.204
Does Starfleet know where
the vessel is now?

10:46.329 --> 10:48.399
Not exactly,
but their heading puts them...

10:48.529 --> 10:51.999
within a half-dozen light-years
of our current position.

10:52.329 --> 10:54.160
We've been ordered to find the ship.

10:54.889 --> 10:57.687
It shouldn't be difficult to isolate
their warp signature.

10:59.489 --> 11:02.401
We'll start searching
at these coordinates.

11:04.249 --> 11:05.648
Go to Tactical Alert.

11:05.769 --> 11:07.725
- Lay in a course.
- Aye, sir.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.284
Buried in the ice for a century.

11:14.809 --> 11:17.198
Hard to believe anything could survive.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.047
Handsome devil.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.967
- You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?
- Yes.

11:35.089 --> 11:38.684
The researchers gathered a great deal
of biometric data on these aliens...

11:38.809 --> 11:41.721
but I'm having trouble
making heads or tails of it.

11:41.849 --> 11:43.077
How can I help?

11:43.329 --> 11:46.446
This arm might contain
some sort of weapon.

11:46.849 --> 11:50.888
If I can determine its yield,
we'll have an idea of what we're facing.

11:54.569 --> 11:57.561
What sort of people would replace
perfectly good body parts...

11:57.689 --> 11:59.839
with cybernetic implants?

12:00.009 --> 12:03.319
You, of all people, should be
open-minded about technology.

12:03.449 --> 12:07.488
I don't have a problem with it,
as long as it stays outside of my skin.

12:07.809 --> 12:10.642
If your heart was damaged,
would you want it replaced...

12:10.769 --> 12:13.044
with a synthetic organ,
or would you rather die?

12:13.169 --> 12:14.158
That's different.

12:14.849 --> 12:17.886
There's a species I once encountered
in the Beta Magellan system...

12:18.049 --> 12:19.004
the Bynars.

12:19.169 --> 12:22.286
When they're born, the surgeon
removes the child's parietal lobe...

12:22.409 --> 12:24.320
and replaces it
with a synaptic processor.

12:24.449 --> 12:26.679
I saw the procedure performed once.

12:26.809 --> 12:29.926
- It was very impressive.
- Yeah, I'm sure it was.

12:30.169 --> 12:31.363
Anything?

12:31.489 --> 12:33.878
I don't see any evidence of a weapon.

12:34.649 --> 12:37.083
The research team was heavily armed.

12:37.809 --> 12:40.801
How did these aliens
manage to overpower them?

12:44.649 --> 12:46.321
Bridge to Captain Archer.

12:46.609 --> 12:47.598
Go ahead.

12:47.729 --> 12:49.765
We're receiving
an automated distress call.

12:49.889 --> 12:51.527
It's from a Tarkalean freighter.

12:56.369 --> 12:58.485
There's a lot of interference.

12:59.409 --> 13:03.641
"To any ship within range, we're under
attack by an unknown species.

13:04.729 --> 13:06.401
"Request immediate assistance."

13:07.889 --> 13:09.242
That's it, sir.

13:11.649 --> 13:13.526
How long to reach them?

13:13.929 --> 13:15.567
About an hour.

13:15.769 --> 13:17.088
Set a course.

13:29.689 --> 13:31.168
Open a channel.

13:32.369 --> 13:35.088
This is Captain Archer
of the Starfleet vessel Enterprise.

13:35.929 --> 13:38.284
Stand down your attack,
or we'll open fire.

13:38.449 --> 13:40.167
They're charging weapons.

13:42.409 --> 13:43.842
Some kind of proton burst.

13:43.969 --> 13:45.846
Those transports aren't normally armed.

13:45.969 --> 13:48.927
Obviously, the engines aren't
the only system they've upgraded.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.721
Any human bio-signs?

13:51.729 --> 13:55.085
Nine on the Arctic transport.
The readings are erratic.

13:57.529 --> 13:59.087
Can you disable their weapons?

13:59.249 --> 14:00.568
I believe so.

14:07.489 --> 14:08.888
Their weapons are down.

14:09.409 --> 14:10.728
They're going to warp.

14:11.129 --> 14:14.007
Is there anyone alive
on the Tarkalean ship?

14:15.169 --> 14:18.286
Two bio-signs on their upper deck.
Reading minimal life support.

14:21.169 --> 14:23.729
Hold our position.
Get a Shuttlepod ready.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.201
You have the Bridge.

14:29.529 --> 14:31.440
The Tarkaleans should live.

14:31.569 --> 14:34.925
The nanoprobes have infiltrated
their autonomic systems.

14:35.129 --> 14:38.007
Their renal glands
have been replaced...

14:38.769 --> 14:40.999
with devices like this.

14:41.129 --> 14:43.689
Essentially, these individuals
are being transformed...

14:43.849 --> 14:46.363
into some sort of cybernetic hybrid.

14:46.489 --> 14:49.003
You said the human bio-signs
were erratic.

14:49.169 --> 14:53.401
It's likely the researchers are going
through a similar transformation.

14:54.969 --> 14:57.529
- Can you remove the nanoprobes?
- Not surgically.

14:57.649 --> 15:00.322
These devices are multiplying
at an extraordinary rate.

15:00.449 --> 15:01.802
I could never extract them all.

15:01.929 --> 15:05.080
I'm attempting to slow their progress
with a modified retro-virus...

15:05.209 --> 15:07.120
but so far I haven't been
very successful.

15:07.249 --> 15:09.763
Perhaps you should isolate them
in the Decon chamber.

15:09.929 --> 15:13.126
If I do that, I won't be able to treat them
as effectively.

15:13.249 --> 15:15.365
I don't believe they're a danger
to the crew.

15:17.289 --> 15:18.847
I'm not so sure.

15:21.569 --> 15:23.127
I'll have Malcolm post a guard.

15:24.689 --> 15:25.963
Keep me updated.

15:39.089 --> 15:40.158
Come in.

15:42.769 --> 15:44.760
I've contacted Tarkalea.

15:45.009 --> 15:48.046
I told them we're doing everything
we can for their crewmen.

15:48.169 --> 15:50.558
- Any sign of the transport?
- Nothing.

15:53.409 --> 15:55.525
There was something familiar
about all this...

15:55.769 --> 15:58.567
but I couldn't put my finger on it
until I found this speech...

15:58.689 --> 16:00.566
Zefram Cochrane made 89 years ago.

16:00.849 --> 16:03.363
When I was a kid,
I read everything I could about him.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.839
It took me a while,
but I finally found it in the database.

16:07.169 --> 16:09.080
He was giving
a commencement address...

16:09.209 --> 16:12.838
at Princeton when he started to talk
about what really happened...

16:12.969 --> 16:14.482
during First Contact.

16:14.809 --> 16:17.960
He mentioned a group of
cybernetic creatures from the future...

16:18.089 --> 16:21.126
who tried to stop his first warp flight
when he was in Montana.

16:21.249 --> 16:24.207
He said they were defeated
by a group of humans...

16:24.329 --> 16:25.967
who were also from the future.

16:26.489 --> 16:30.368
As I recall, Cochrane was famous
for his imaginative stories.

16:31.169 --> 16:34.081
He was also known to be
frequently intoxicated.

16:34.449 --> 16:36.405
No one took him seriously.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.845
He recanted the whole thing
a few years later.

16:38.969 --> 16:41.199
But you have to admit,
there are similarities.

16:42.969 --> 16:46.006
He said their ultimate goal
was to enslave the human race.

16:46.969 --> 16:51.326
If he was right, they might be heading
back to their home world...

16:52.209 --> 16:53.688
so they can try it again.

17:04.449 --> 17:05.643
Who are you?

17:05.769 --> 17:10.080
My name is Phlox. I'm a physician.
You're aboard a starship.

17:10.209 --> 17:12.518
We responded to your distress call.

17:13.648 --> 17:15.207
What did you do to me?

17:15.329 --> 17:18.241
Your vessel was attacked.
I'm doing my very best to treat you.

17:19.529 --> 17:21.121
I'm going to sedate him.

17:51.929 --> 17:54.841
Doctor. Phlox!

17:56.049 --> 17:57.607
What happened?

17:57.889 --> 17:59.481
We were attacked.

18:06.689 --> 18:09.249
I've been infected with the nanoprobes.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.961
One of the aliens injected me,
some sort of tubules.

18:13.129 --> 18:14.164
Captain?

18:15.649 --> 18:17.048
They left through here.

18:18.289 --> 18:19.802
Seal off the maintenance shafts.

18:19.929 --> 18:21.760
Post teams at every access point.

18:21.889 --> 18:23.800
When you find them, put them in Decon,
maximum security.

18:23.929 --> 18:24.884
Aye, sir.

18:25.009 --> 18:26.647
Use extreme caution, Lieutenant.

18:26.769 --> 18:28.566
Their physical strength
has been enhanced.

18:28.689 --> 18:30.600
It's critical you don't let them touch you.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.807
You haven't been infected.

18:38.329 --> 18:39.762
Thanks, Doctor.

18:40.529 --> 18:42.679
Stay here in case
there are any more problems.

18:42.809 --> 18:44.083
Understood.

18:47.289 --> 18:49.086
Call the Bridge if you need anything.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.681
Actually, it's feeding time
for my Edosian slugs.

18:55.849 --> 18:59.637
They're quite partial to boiled rootleaf.
I usually pick some up from the galley...

18:59.769 --> 19:01.361
but under the circumstances...

19:03.649 --> 19:05.401
I'll have it brought down.

19:50.489 --> 19:53.640
They've modified most of the primary
systems, engines, hull plating.

19:53.769 --> 19:55.248
These look like weapons nodes.

19:55.369 --> 19:57.644
I don't even want to guess
what this thing's for.

19:58.329 --> 20:00.797
Doesn't look like they've enhanced
the aft plating yet.

20:00.929 --> 20:02.442
If we can punch through it here...

20:02.569 --> 20:05.561
we should be able to knock out this
EPS manifold...

20:05.689 --> 20:07.042
take down their main power.

20:07.169 --> 20:08.887
One or two torpedoes ought to do it.

20:09.009 --> 20:10.283
T'Pol to Captain Archer.

20:10.569 --> 20:11.763
Go ahead.

20:11.889 --> 20:14.198
I've located the transport
on long-range sensors.

20:14.329 --> 20:16.479
They're travelling at warp 4.8.

20:16.609 --> 20:17.758
How far are they?

20:17.889 --> 20:19.607
Less than two light-years.

20:19.729 --> 20:21.799
Coax a little more power
out of the engines.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.044
I'll give it a shot.

20:23.169 --> 20:25.763
Travis, lay in a course, warp 4.9.

20:25.929 --> 20:27.157
Aye, sir.

20:27.529 --> 20:29.918
They doubled their top speed
in less than 12 hours.

20:30.049 --> 20:32.563
Let's hope they didn't upgrade
their weapons.

21:30.809 --> 21:32.879
Stop what you're doing!

21:34.009 --> 21:35.920
I'll fire if I have to.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.320
I said, step away!

21:47.049 --> 21:48.801
Maximum setting.

21:53.209 --> 21:54.358
Fall back!

22:08.609 --> 22:10.088
Reed to the Bridge.

22:10.529 --> 22:11.757
Go ahead.

22:12.009 --> 22:14.079
They're in Maintenance Shaft C,
Junction 12.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.927
They appear to be modifying systems.

22:16.249 --> 22:19.207
- What's in that junction?
- Warp plasma regulators.

22:20.049 --> 22:21.277
Can you stop them?

22:21.409 --> 22:22.603
Our weapons were useless.

22:22.729 --> 22:25.038
They were equipped
with some kind of energy shielding.

22:25.169 --> 22:27.444
Sir, our warp field's destabilising.

22:28.169 --> 22:29.648
It's them.

22:30.409 --> 22:32.479
Isn't there an outer hatch
in that junction?

22:32.609 --> 22:33.598
Yes.

22:37.849 --> 22:41.842
Malcolm, get out of that section
and seal it off.

22:41.969 --> 22:43.288
Understood.

22:44.289 --> 22:45.563
Come on. Go.

22:45.689 --> 22:46.883
Take us out of warp.

22:54.769 --> 22:56.088
We're clear, Captain.

22:57.529 --> 22:58.962
Subcommander?

23:11.089 --> 23:12.488
The junction's empty.

23:14.809 --> 23:16.959
Close the hatch and re-pressurise.

23:20.609 --> 23:23.282
Malcolm, I want you to work with Trip.

23:23.489 --> 23:26.481
- Find out what they were doing in there.
- Aye, sir.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.366
Resume course and speed.

23:30.769 --> 23:32.441
You had no choice.

23:43.209 --> 23:44.483
Room service.

23:45.769 --> 23:46.963
What's this?

23:47.649 --> 23:49.480
Rootleaf lettuce for your slugs...

23:49.609 --> 23:53.318
Vulcan sandworms for the bat,
and angel hair pasta...

23:53.449 --> 23:55.007
for the ship's physician.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.643
It's best if I avoid food
for the time being.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.407
You need to keep up your strength.

23:59.529 --> 24:02.043
If I eat, my cellular metabolism
will accelerate.

24:02.169 --> 24:04.046
The nanoprobes could spread further.

24:06.769 --> 24:09.886
It's right here if you change your mind.

24:10.729 --> 24:13.118
Why are you wearing a phase-pistol?

24:14.369 --> 24:16.166
It's Lieutenant Reed's idea.

24:17.009 --> 24:19.569
If you come near me,
I'm supposed to shoot you.

24:19.689 --> 24:21.407
I hope you'll use the stun setting.

24:22.649 --> 24:26.164
It's going to be a few hours before
we catch up with that transport.

24:26.289 --> 24:30.043
I'm sure that Captain Archer wouldn't
mind if I stayed for a little while...

24:30.209 --> 24:31.528
kept you company.

24:31.649 --> 24:35.403
I appreciate the offer, but it may not
be safe to be near me right now.

24:35.609 --> 24:37.486
I'm armed, remember?

24:42.009 --> 24:45.160
You've looked after me more times
than I can count.

24:45.889 --> 24:47.322
I want to return the favour.

24:47.969 --> 24:50.688
The technology could assert itself
at any moment.

24:50.809 --> 24:53.562
I don't know what will happen if it does.

24:53.969 --> 24:55.846
I underestimated
these nanoprobes once.

24:55.969 --> 24:59.006
I don't intend to make
the same mistake twice.

25:01.689 --> 25:04.522
Do you mind if I feed your animals
before I go?

25:25.169 --> 25:27.125
They did a real number
on these circuits.

25:27.249 --> 25:29.524
It could take days to get all this junk out.

25:29.649 --> 25:31.367
What do you think
they were doing here?

25:31.489 --> 25:32.842
I don't know...

25:33.889 --> 25:36.961
but they almost overloaded
the plasma regulators.

25:37.089 --> 25:38.727
Doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

25:38.849 --> 25:40.919
Why blow up the ship
if you're still on it?

25:41.089 --> 25:42.363
Hand me that, will you?

25:43.609 --> 25:45.565
That shielding of theirs was impressive.

25:45.769 --> 25:48.329
We might as well have been firing
holographic bullets.

25:48.449 --> 25:50.644
It's too bad you didn't get a closer look.

25:50.769 --> 25:52.805
That kind of technology
could come in handy.

25:52.929 --> 25:56.444
There's got to be a way to get through
those shields with phase-pistols.

25:56.569 --> 26:00.244
If I cross-polarised the power cells,
it might increase the particle yield.

26:00.369 --> 26:02.041
I'll be in the Armoury.

26:16.289 --> 26:17.927
Coffee with cream.

26:20.889 --> 26:22.959
I believe Crewman Cunningham
is in the galley...

26:23.089 --> 26:24.602
if you'd like something else.

26:26.169 --> 26:27.397
This'll be fine.

26:31.529 --> 26:33.918
- Is this seat taken?
- Please.

26:41.089 --> 26:42.761
Lieutenant Reed informed me that...

26:42.889 --> 26:45.801
you plan to disable the transport
when we find it.

26:46.049 --> 26:49.837
He thinks we can knock out the power
systems without causing much damage.

26:49.969 --> 26:52.529
So you still intend to rescue
the humans?

26:52.769 --> 26:54.407
That's the general idea.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.407
If they've already been transformed,
that could be difficult.

26:58.769 --> 27:00.999
I want to take these people home.

27:01.449 --> 27:03.724
The humans and the Tarkaleans...

27:04.849 --> 27:06.965
no matter what state they're in.

27:07.249 --> 27:09.888
There are 29 life forms
on that transport.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.597
It's logical to assume
they've all been infected.

27:12.729 --> 27:15.607
We could endanger Enterprise
if they're brought aboard.

27:15.729 --> 27:17.720
Perhaps you should reconsider.

27:17.849 --> 27:20.044
Are you saying we shouldn't go
after that ship?

27:20.169 --> 27:22.444
I'm saying we destroy it.

27:23.489 --> 27:25.320
Phlox to Captain Archer.

27:30.489 --> 27:31.558
Go ahead.

27:31.689 --> 27:33.600
Would you please come to Sickbay?

27:33.729 --> 27:35.003
On my way.

27:38.409 --> 27:40.923
I'm not ready to declare them
a lost cause.

27:56.769 --> 27:58.282
How are you feeling?

27:59.209 --> 28:01.040
Better than I anticipated.

28:01.409 --> 28:05.038
The nanoprobes seem to be having
trouble with my immune system.

28:05.209 --> 28:09.441
But they are persistent little fellows.
It won't be long before they adapt.

28:09.929 --> 28:12.727
- Any progress finding a treatment?
- Possibly.

28:13.049 --> 28:14.880
I've been attempting to treat
the infection...

28:15.009 --> 28:16.806
as if it were, well, an infection.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.363
Then it occurred to me
this isn't a biological problem.

28:19.489 --> 28:22.208
I need to think like an engineer,
not a physician.

28:22.329 --> 28:24.968
I extracted several of the devices
and subjected them...

28:25.089 --> 28:26.681
to different forms of radiation.

28:26.809 --> 28:31.360
Their intramolecular processors appear
to be vulnerable to omicron particles.

28:32.409 --> 28:35.128
But if one of the nanoprobes survives...

28:35.249 --> 28:38.207
it will start to multiply again...

28:38.329 --> 28:41.002
so I'll need to program
a rather excessive dose.

28:41.209 --> 28:44.599
The side effects will not be pleasant,
to say the least.

28:45.009 --> 28:48.604
You may want to keep this,
in the event I am unsuccessful.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.082
What is it?

28:51.209 --> 28:52.881
A cure of sorts.

28:53.449 --> 28:54.848
It contains a neural toxin...

28:54.969 --> 28:58.757
that will terminate my synaptic functions
within a matter of seconds.

28:59.089 --> 29:01.239
Aren't you jumping the gun a little?

29:01.569 --> 29:05.767
I have no intention of turning into
one of those cybernetic creatures.

29:09.569 --> 29:12.720
Increase power another
five megajoules.

29:14.049 --> 29:16.688
Fire. Keep it going.

29:17.409 --> 29:19.127
Increase to seven megajoules.

29:20.449 --> 29:23.725
Try eight. Nine.

29:25.569 --> 29:27.605
The density's holding. Bring it up to 10.

29:32.649 --> 29:34.241
That should do it.

29:35.329 --> 29:38.127
We'll reach that transport
in less than an hour.

29:38.289 --> 29:40.849
Let's modify as many of these
as we can.

29:49.609 --> 29:52.248
The vessel's mass
has increased by 3%.

29:53.049 --> 29:56.007
They've improved their defences
since we last saw them.

29:56.569 --> 30:01.279
They're accelerating,
warp 4.96, 4.98...

30:01.409 --> 30:02.888
Increase speed.

30:07.929 --> 30:09.123
We're closing.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.765
Target that EPS manifold.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.122
They're dropping to impulse.

30:24.329 --> 30:27.560
They're sending a transmission,
some kind of activation sequence.

30:27.729 --> 30:28.764
Block it!

30:28.889 --> 30:30.083
I can't.

30:37.569 --> 30:38.922
Tucker to the Bridge!

30:39.089 --> 30:41.922
These cybernetic circuits just lit up
like a Christmas tree!

30:44.329 --> 30:47.560
They're disrupting our plasma network.
Main power is failing.

30:47.689 --> 30:48.883
We're losing weapons.

30:50.209 --> 30:51.483
They set us up.

30:53.609 --> 30:56.123
They're hailing us. Audio only.

30:58.809 --> 31:00.003
This is Captain...

31:00.129 --> 31:02.962
You will be assimilated.
Resistance is futile.

31:22.409 --> 31:24.127
Hull plating's down to 81%.

31:24.249 --> 31:26.046
Trip, we could use weapons.

31:27.329 --> 31:28.762
It's gonna be a few minutes.

31:31.529 --> 31:32.962
Plating's down another 12%.

31:34.009 --> 31:35.681
Is the Transporter still online?

31:35.809 --> 31:37.606
- For the moment.
- Then you're with me.

31:37.969 --> 31:39.163
Captain!

31:39.289 --> 31:41.359
I'm counting on you to pull us
out of there.

31:48.369 --> 31:49.722
Doctor?

31:52.009 --> 31:53.761
I've programmed
the irradiation sequence.

31:53.889 --> 31:56.528
But I'll need you to activate it
once the chamber's sealed.

31:56.649 --> 31:58.605
All you have to do is press this.

32:26.809 --> 32:28.447
I've doubled the particle yield.

32:28.769 --> 32:31.329
It may take a few seconds to recharge
after each shot.

32:31.529 --> 32:33.963
Put us as close as you can
to their EPS manifold.

32:34.089 --> 32:35.078
Aye, sir.

33:09.889 --> 33:11.402
Hull plating's at 23%.

34:04.449 --> 34:07.202
- This was one of the researchers.
- Was?

34:08.409 --> 34:11.161
Look at these bio-signs.
They're not human anymore.

34:13.369 --> 34:14.404
Sir.

34:22.649 --> 34:25.004
We've been boarded.
Six bio-signs, C-Deck.

34:25.129 --> 34:27.404
Alert Security.
Bridge to Commander Tucker.

34:27.969 --> 34:29.197
Go ahead.

34:29.688 --> 34:31.042
How much longer?

34:31.168 --> 34:33.808
I think I've isolated
one of the power relays. Stand by.

34:45.489 --> 34:46.967
Another human?

34:48.289 --> 34:49.483
Same as the others.

35:47.009 --> 35:48.158
That's it.

35:58.529 --> 35:59.678
Captain!

36:10.529 --> 36:11.803
We've lost hull plating.

36:12.689 --> 36:15.806
They're cutting into the hull.
E-Deck, starboard forequarter.

36:15.929 --> 36:17.328
Evacuate that section.

36:17.569 --> 36:19.924
They've adapted. Hurry, Malcolm.

36:21.049 --> 36:22.402
Archer to Enterprise.

36:22.529 --> 36:23.928
Stand by, Transporter.

36:24.249 --> 36:25.477
Acknowledged.

36:25.769 --> 36:26.918
Now!

36:49.769 --> 36:50.963
Tucker to the Bridge.

36:51.089 --> 36:52.204
Go ahead.

36:52.329 --> 36:55.082
- The alien circuits are losing power.
- Do we have weapons?

36:55.209 --> 36:56.562
They're coming online now.

37:04.449 --> 37:05.438
Report.

37:05.569 --> 37:07.719
Our engines and weapons
are back on-line.

37:07.849 --> 37:10.921
The transport's been disabled,
so has the alien circuitry.

37:11.689 --> 37:13.919
Did you find the research team?

37:16.929 --> 37:19.762
There isn't anyone on that ship
we can help anymore.

37:22.289 --> 37:25.167
Sir, something's happening
on the transport.

37:25.809 --> 37:27.845
Their systems are being restored.

37:27.969 --> 37:29.402
They're charging weapons.

37:29.529 --> 37:32.327
Target their warp core.
Hit them with everything we've got.

37:49.409 --> 37:51.001
Get me Admiral Forrest.

37:57.289 --> 38:00.838
Captain's Starlog, March 1, 2153.

38:00.969 --> 38:02.766
Repairs to the ship are under way.

38:02.929 --> 38:05.648
We've resumed our previous heading
at low warp.

38:05.769 --> 38:09.523
Doctor Phlox is confident
he'll make a complete recovery.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.120
Aren't you supposed to be in bed?

38:16.249 --> 38:18.365
I'm merely catching up
on some paperwork.

38:18.489 --> 38:21.083
Nothing too strenuous, I assure you.

38:21.209 --> 38:24.884
It's vital to keep the mind occupied
during the healing process.

38:25.129 --> 38:27.802
They say doctors make
the worst patients.

38:29.369 --> 38:31.758
Captain, there's something
you should know.

38:32.649 --> 38:35.959
I had a rather strange experience
while I was infected.

38:36.769 --> 38:39.522
I believe I was connected
with the aliens...

38:39.649 --> 38:42.402
possibly through
some form of telepathy.

38:43.089 --> 38:45.808
Do you think they were
trying to communicate with you?

38:45.929 --> 38:47.044
Not precisely.

38:47.169 --> 38:50.286
It felt as though I was
part of a group consciousness.

38:50.449 --> 38:54.601
You were under extraordinary physical
stress. You may have imagined it.

38:54.969 --> 38:56.482
It seemed quite real.

38:57.129 --> 38:59.723
I couldn't understand most of what
I was hearing.

38:59.849 --> 39:03.159
But I got the impression they were trying
to send a subspace message.

39:03.489 --> 39:06.959
They transmitted a numerical sequence.

39:08.649 --> 39:10.924
I heard it over and over again.

39:18.409 --> 39:19.524
Come in.

39:23.609 --> 39:25.884
The computer analysed
Phlox's numbers.

39:26.329 --> 39:30.242
They're pulsar frequencies, with
geometric light-year measurements.

39:30.929 --> 39:32.203
Spatial coordinates.

39:34.929 --> 39:37.602
They told their home world
how to find Earth.

39:37.889 --> 39:40.164
Did you learn where the message
was sent?

39:41.009 --> 39:43.477
Somewhere deep in the Delta Quadrant.

39:43.929 --> 39:46.648
Then I doubt
there's any immediate danger.

39:46.769 --> 39:50.000
It would take at least 200 years
for a subspace message...

39:50.129 --> 39:53.121
to reach the Delta Quadrant,
assuming it's received at all.

39:54.849 --> 39:57.727
Sounds to me like we've only
postponed the invasion...

39:57.849 --> 40:01.000
until what, the 24th century?

40:02.305 --> 40:08.806
