00:31.917 --> 00:36.583
Jesus Christ, this is
a fuckin' nightmare.

00:38.416 --> 00:40.667
Goddamnit.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.166
You've been a bad boy!

00:43.249 --> 00:44.875
Do you hear me?!

00:44.958 --> 00:48.041
Bad! B-A-D!

00:48.124 --> 00:51.458
How many fuckin' times?
I swear to God!

00:57.375 --> 00:59.208
You've been a bad boy!

00:59.291 --> 01:02.708
You heard me?!

01:02.792 --> 01:07.750
Ya know, I feel like we just keep
havin' this same conversation.

01:07.833 --> 01:11.792
I can't take you anywhere
anymore!

01:11.875 --> 01:14.750
OK? And I got to say it, awright?

01:14.833 --> 01:17.917
This shit is embarrassing!

01:25.999 --> 01:27.792
Remind me of something.

01:27.875 --> 01:30.541
What was the first thing I said
when we came in here?

01:30.625 --> 01:34.083
Huh? I said we come in quiet,
and we don't make a mess.

01:34.166 --> 01:36.291
Yeah, exactly.

01:36.375 --> 01:39.083
But you come in,
and since we don't know

01:39.166 --> 01:43.208
who the fuck's been here, what kind of
weird-ass perfume they've been wearin',

01:43.291 --> 01:45.958
and your scent's off...
You being you,

01:46.041 --> 01:48.375
your self-preservation
instinct kicks in

01:48.458 --> 01:50.208
and you just shit everywhere.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.083
Oh, goddamnit.

01:56.291 --> 01:59.416
I'll give you that, buddy,
I will.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.667
I... I get it.

02:01.750 --> 02:06.333
I'm sorry...
that I had to bring you here,

02:06.416 --> 02:09.958
and I'm really sorry that
I put you in this position.

02:10.041 --> 02:13.291
But I need you to stay
in there a while...

02:13.375 --> 02:17.041
until I figure out
if this situation is copacetic.

02:18.583 --> 02:21.583
Deal?

02:21.667 --> 02:27.416
No, no, calm, no... Hey!

02:27.500 --> 02:28.917
Calm!

02:28.999 --> 02:30.958
Yes.

02:31.041 --> 02:32.625
Who's the handsome man?

02:32.708 --> 02:35.541
You are.
You're the handsome man.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.999
And you're a calm handsome man,
right?

02:38.083 --> 02:41.166
I need you to be so calm
for us now, dearheart.

02:41.249 --> 02:44.875
OK? And if you're calm,
I'm gonna give you

02:44.958 --> 02:47.500
your special treat. Right?

02:47.583 --> 02:50.083
Such a handsome man.

03:46.041 --> 03:47.875
That's right, dear.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.458
Nummy nums.

04:05.667 --> 04:09.333
You must be the art enthusiast.
Sharon.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.541
You're... Allan?

04:11.625 --> 04:13.458
Yup, that's me. Welcome.

04:13.541 --> 04:15.750
Thanks for comin' so soon.
Come on in.

04:15.833 --> 04:17.208
Thanks.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.124
Uh, any trouble
finding the place?

04:33.208 --> 04:34.458
Nope.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.750
Can I, uh, sit down?

04:38.833 --> 04:41.083
Oh! God, yes. Of course. Yes.

04:41.166 --> 04:43.416
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.708
So sorry.

04:44.792 --> 04:46.999
Um, I'd offer you
something to drink,

04:47.083 --> 04:50.124
but this place doesn't have
a goddamn mini-bar.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.249
Well...

04:54.458 --> 04:56.958
should we get down
to the business at hand?

04:57.041 --> 04:59.249
Oh, I like your style.

04:59.333 --> 05:03.083
No bullshit, huh?
You're my kind of girl.

05:03.166 --> 05:06.124
Let's get down to business.

05:06.208 --> 05:07.625
All right.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.750
Is... Is that necessary?

05:09.833 --> 05:13.041
Oh, yeah. I mean,
we're lookin' at the real thing here.

05:13.124 --> 05:14.833
I take every precaution.

05:14.917 --> 05:17.750
And this is the real thing?

05:17.833 --> 05:20.208
Oh, honey...

05:20.291 --> 05:22.375
when you see him in the flesh,

05:22.458 --> 05:25.166
there's no question.

05:26.291 --> 05:28.458
Impressive, right?

05:28.541 --> 05:29.958
I can't say what they mean,

05:30.041 --> 05:33.708
exactly, but interpreting
any artist's work,

05:33.792 --> 05:36.667
there's always a code...

05:36.750 --> 05:39.124
to deciphering his intent.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.917
Uh-huh.

05:43.833 --> 05:46.458
And I don't know how
to make this any more obvious

05:46.541 --> 05:51.917
for you, Sharon,
but I know the artist.

05:54.249 --> 05:55.708
"Elmer."

05:57.750 --> 05:59.208
What was that?

05:59.291 --> 06:02.416
I got here, and that thing
was running like crazy.

06:02.500 --> 06:06.375
I had to take the top off, jigger with
the flange, the chain's all fucked up...

06:06.458 --> 06:08.041
It's been gurgling off and on.

06:08.124 --> 06:10.708
What do you take me for, Allan?

06:10.792 --> 06:12.333
Excuse me?

06:12.416 --> 06:15.583
Did you think I was here
to buy finger paintings?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.500
I have no idea.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.833
I want to meet him.

06:21.917 --> 06:23.625
Really?

06:23.708 --> 06:26.166
See, I feel like
I have given you

06:26.249 --> 06:30.041
multiple opportunities
to make that happen here.

06:30.124 --> 06:33.750
You mean you want me
to say your password?

06:33.833 --> 06:38.166
Yes. I like to think of it
as a "code phrase,"

06:38.249 --> 06:41.999
but yeah, you need to fuckin' say
my code phrase, or there's no deal.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.750
I didn't get
that part of the email.

06:44.833 --> 06:48.416
It was cut off after you told
me when I came in the room

06:48.500 --> 06:50.708
I needed to ask
about the "artist,"

06:50.792 --> 06:53.792
who was in "exile" or something.

06:55.667 --> 06:58.375
OK, OK, well, close enough.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.041
I'm not good with computers.

07:00.124 --> 07:01.750
Whoa, sorry about that.

07:01.833 --> 07:02.999
Are we doing this, or what?

07:03.083 --> 07:04.083
Wh... Ha ha ha!

07:04.166 --> 07:05.917
Just because
you know the code phrase

07:05.999 --> 07:08.124
does not mean
you're right for this.

07:08.208 --> 07:10.208
No, I still need to vet you.

07:10.291 --> 07:12.833
Really?

07:14.166 --> 07:16.625
It won't be so bad.

07:16.708 --> 07:19.083
Everyone remembers Bubbles.

07:19.166 --> 07:23.416
Bubbles got all the attention.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.458
I don't know
if you remember, but...

07:26.541 --> 07:29.958
Michael even took him
on tour with him once.

07:30.041 --> 07:34.333
But people forget Elmer...
Elmer the gorilla.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.333
Elmer was Michael Jackson's
special gorilla,

07:38.416 --> 07:41.625
and then one day,
he was my special gorilla.

07:41.708 --> 07:43.750
How's that?

07:43.833 --> 07:47.166
When Michael died
and they cleared out Neverland,

07:47.249 --> 07:50.750
those of us who had connections
in the animal community,

07:50.833 --> 07:52.541
we got first dibs,

07:52.625 --> 07:55.625
and my wife at the time and I,
we had a sanctuary

07:55.708 --> 07:58.667
and we were a perfect fit.

08:01.541 --> 08:06.958
Yeah, well, let's just say things
went belly-up on all fronts.

08:07.041 --> 08:09.875
It's just me and Elmer now.

08:21.249 --> 08:23.249
I wanna see him.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.458
What makes you think
you can handle this?

08:27.541 --> 08:30.416
Experience. Training.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.792
Really?

08:32.875 --> 08:35.500
Have you ever been to Vallejo?

08:35.582 --> 08:37.582
It's in Northern California.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.667
- No.
- Well,

08:39.750 --> 08:41.582
there's an animal park there.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.792
It's called Marine World.

08:43.875 --> 08:46.333
Or it was. Six Flags bought it

08:46.416 --> 08:50.375
and it's a big fat
roller coaster abomination now.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.208
I loved going there as a kid,

08:53.291 --> 08:56.333
and when I got to be
the right age,

08:56.416 --> 08:57.917
I went to work there.

08:57.999 --> 08:59.667
No shit. That's awesome.

08:59.750 --> 09:03.375
And eventually I got to work
with the gorillas. Mm-hmm.

09:03.458 --> 09:05.792
I was one of the gorilla girls.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.708
Gorilla girls.

09:07.792 --> 09:09.875
Yeah, that's what
they called us.

09:11.458 --> 09:14.833
Marine World had the largest
number of gorillas in captivity

09:14.917 --> 09:16.958
on the West Coast,

09:17.041 --> 09:19.375
and the gorillas
would go into these fits,

09:19.458 --> 09:23.583
and we developed these highly
specialized processes to calm then down.

09:23.667 --> 09:24.875
Right, right, right, right!

09:24.958 --> 09:27.541
My wife, she used to
show Elmer her breasts,

09:27.625 --> 09:30.792
she'd just pop 'em out,
and it would chill him right out.

09:31.875 --> 09:35.041
Is that... Is that what
you were gonna say?

09:35.124 --> 09:38.416
No, that... that seems odd to me.

09:38.500 --> 09:42.041
Yeah, well,
when he gets into the red zone,

09:42.124 --> 09:44.291
you got very few options.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.541
Allan...

09:48.333 --> 09:50.999
do you believe that
I'm the real thing?

09:53.833 --> 09:55.458
I believe you.

09:55.541 --> 09:59.166
So if you believe me,
why aren't we making this deal happen?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.260
Wow. You get to the point,
I'll give ya that.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.083
You get to the point.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.249
He needs to be with someone

10:05.333 --> 10:07.124
who knows how
to take care of him.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.583
You know what?

10:12.667 --> 10:14.667
Do you even have
the fucking money? Huh?

10:14.750 --> 10:18.291
Now that this is all out in the
open, let's see the cash.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.583
Get it out, lay it on the table.

10:20.667 --> 10:23.208
All right, all right,
hold your horses.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.500
That smell real to you?

10:35.041 --> 10:36.958
Yeah, it smells like ten grand.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.500
You can count it if you want.

10:39.583 --> 10:42.249
No, the weight feels right.

10:42.333 --> 10:45.375
Well, maybe I'll...
I'll count it.

10:46.958 --> 10:50.999
A Taser gun? Are you serious?

10:51.083 --> 10:53.291
I can't leave anything
up to chance.

10:53.375 --> 10:56.833
- You don't carry one?
- I don't believe in them.

10:56.917 --> 11:00.958
You get into a situation where
you need something like this,

11:01.041 --> 11:02.625
it's probably
your own damn fault

11:02.708 --> 11:04.541
and you're gonna get
what you deserve.

11:08.375 --> 11:11.917
If that really is Elmer
in there,

11:11.999 --> 11:14.041
how'd you get him
to be so quiet?

11:14.124 --> 11:17.500
Why doesn't he just open the
door and come out on his own?

11:17.583 --> 11:20.333
He's a little on
the lethargic side.

11:20.416 --> 11:24.458
I just kinda set him in a spot where
he's comfortable, and he just stays put.

11:26.750 --> 11:30.458
You haven't altered his diet
in any weird way or anything?

11:30.541 --> 11:33.333
I mean... he's not sick?

11:33.416 --> 11:37.291
I'm not sellin' him 'cause I don't
know how to take care of him.

11:37.375 --> 11:40.083
Is that what you're asking? Huh?

11:40.166 --> 11:42.249
So why are you
selling him, then?

11:44.333 --> 11:46.416
It's time. It's...

11:48.875 --> 11:52.375
He's grown financially
unsustainable

11:52.458 --> 11:55.375
and I can't keep him
in a lifestyle

11:55.458 --> 11:58.833
that he's accustomed to anymore.

11:58.917 --> 12:01.208
I can assure you

12:01.291 --> 12:04.708
he will receive all the care
that is required with me,

12:04.792 --> 12:06.958
at my sanctuary.

12:07.041 --> 12:10.541
I've had many, many like him
under my supervision.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.667
No! No, no, no! Don't open that!

12:12.750 --> 12:14.416
He's not ready.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.917
He's not ready,
or you're not ready?

12:18.958 --> 12:20.667
If you're gonna meet him,

12:20.750 --> 12:22.917
I want the mood to be right, OK?

12:22.999 --> 12:26.041
He is all about
first impressions.

12:26.124 --> 12:27.625
Hmm?

12:37.833 --> 12:41.458
OK. This feels right.

12:41.541 --> 12:43.625
I think we're ready.

12:43.708 --> 12:45.375
All right, I'm...

12:45.458 --> 12:48.583
I... I'd just avoid
direct eye contact with him,

12:48.667 --> 12:50.249
he's been in there
a couple hours,

12:50.333 --> 12:52.500
he may be a little cracked out.

12:52.583 --> 12:55.041
You don't want me
to look at him?

12:55.124 --> 12:58.583
No, you can look at him, just
don't, you know, sneer at him.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.500
Don't worry about me.

13:00.583 --> 13:03.333
I'm not worried about you.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.500
OK.

13:05.583 --> 13:08.083
Here we go.

13:21.333 --> 13:24.083
Hi, baby.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.166
Hi, big boy. Hi!

13:26.249 --> 13:27.875
How are you?

13:27.958 --> 13:30.291
I know it's been
a really long time,

13:30.375 --> 13:32.083
and you've been so patient,

13:32.166 --> 13:34.124
you've been so patient in here.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.458
Now it's time to come out. OK?

13:36.541 --> 13:38.166
You wanna take my hand?

13:38.249 --> 13:40.458
Come on. Come on, baby.

13:40.541 --> 13:43.875
Good boy.

13:46.249 --> 13:47.999
There we go.

13:48.083 --> 13:51.458
Yeah, buddy, yeah, good boy.

13:51.541 --> 13:53.249
Good boy.

13:59.917 --> 14:02.333
There you go.
Right onto the corner.

14:02.416 --> 14:04.833
Yeah, good boy!

14:04.917 --> 14:06.833
Good boy.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.375
Who's a handsome boy?

14:09.458 --> 14:11.291
Is that a handsome boy?

14:11.375 --> 14:13.249
Good boy.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.249
Sharon... meet Elmer.

14:17.917 --> 14:18.958
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.500
Let him come to you. Here.

14:23.667 --> 14:27.166
Why are you giving him bananas?
He's not a chimpanzee.

14:27.249 --> 14:29.291
I know, but he likes 'em,
and if you want him

14:29.375 --> 14:31.291
to come to you,
you'll give 'em to him.

14:31.375 --> 14:34.083
- Just remember to keep your...
- Keep my fingers together.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.291
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doin'.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.833
It's OK, buddy. It's OK.

14:41.917 --> 14:44.208
This is Sharon,
she's our new friend.

14:44.291 --> 14:46.875
Yeah, it's OK.

14:46.958 --> 14:49.333
- It's OK, buddy.
- Hey.

14:49.416 --> 14:51.249
It's OK.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.667
Good boy. Good boy.

14:58.375 --> 15:02.708
So...
what do you think of Elmer?

15:02.792 --> 15:04.500
Oh, he's cute.

15:06.333 --> 15:07.583
You think he's cute?

15:07.667 --> 15:10.249
Yeah. I've seen 'em ugly before.

15:10.333 --> 15:13.416
This guy's a cutie.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.291
Cute.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.625
You know what?

15:17.708 --> 15:22.375
I don't think this is the right fit.
Oh, buddy...

15:22.458 --> 15:24.750
I don't know how else
I can assure you, Allan,

15:24.833 --> 15:27.917
I've got 20 years' experience
with primates.

15:27.999 --> 15:30.291
Specifically with Elmer's genus.

15:30.375 --> 15:33.166
So then you know what it means
that he's almost 20 years old

15:33.249 --> 15:35.917
and he's lived his entire life
in captivity.

15:35.999 --> 15:41.208
Well, besides his time with you, it sounds
like he's had a rich lifestyle for a gorilla.

15:41.291 --> 15:42.500
We do all right. OK?

15:42.583 --> 15:44.375
It took some time,

15:44.458 --> 15:46.208
but Elmer's gotten used
to life on the road.

15:46.291 --> 15:48.625
You've been traveling with him?

15:48.708 --> 15:52.249
You know that's complete havoc
on his nervous system!

15:52.333 --> 15:54.583
Of course I do, goddamnit.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.458
Why do you think you're here?
Huh?

15:56.541 --> 15:58.083
Since Elmer came into my life,

15:58.166 --> 16:00.625
he's been mine,
he's been my blood.

16:00.708 --> 16:02.541
And it was great.

16:02.625 --> 16:05.458
But now suddenly he's
matured, and I've got

16:05.541 --> 16:09.291
a fuckin' seriously fucking
intense animal on my hands.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.458
I mean, it is fucked up.

16:11.541 --> 16:15.124
He's got to take Xanax just to
exist in this dogshit world.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.541
You... You've been
giving him Xanax?!

16:17.625 --> 16:19.291
Hell yes, I have.

16:19.375 --> 16:21.291
Every day
for the past five years

16:21.375 --> 16:22.750
I've put it in his treats.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.124
Does the trick.

16:24.208 --> 16:25.583
No side effects.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.333
Well, you do realize

16:27.416 --> 16:29.875
that he is basically
addicted now?

16:29.958 --> 16:33.625
Yeah. It's the only thing keeping
him from ripping my damn face off.

16:33.708 --> 16:38.625
OK? This dude has
zero impulse control.

16:38.708 --> 16:41.500
He doesn't understand things
on a human level.

16:41.583 --> 16:44.083
In his mind,
he's still in the jungle.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.750
He's not supposed to be here.

16:56.833 --> 16:59.291
You're tellin' me.

16:59.375 --> 17:03.875
He's not supposed to be in
this hotel room, he's...

17:03.958 --> 17:07.500
nor is he supposed
to be living in your van.

17:07.583 --> 17:11.500
He needs to be in a facility
where there are caretakers

17:11.583 --> 17:14.791
who know how to respond
to his needs.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.458
You know what?

17:19.540 --> 17:21.958
I'm sick of your
condescending shit.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.666
Deal's off.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.290
Come on, buddy,
let's get the fuck outta here.

17:30.625 --> 17:33.708
I don't understand.

17:33.792 --> 17:36.583
Here's how it's gonna go
from this point, Allan.

17:36.667 --> 17:39.375
You're gonna turn around,
you're gonna walk away from me,

17:39.458 --> 17:41.291
placing your hands on the wall.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.750
I'm gonna radio backup,

17:42.833 --> 17:44.875
and were going to take Elmer
to his new home.

17:44.958 --> 17:46.833
I'm placing you under arrest

17:46.917 --> 17:49.375
for trafficking in
unlicensed exotic animals.

17:49.458 --> 17:53.291
No. Come... This isn't how
it was supposed to happen.

17:53.375 --> 17:57.041
Our entire conversation
has been recorded, Allan.

17:57.124 --> 17:58.583
It's the only way.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.958
No, no, I can't...
I can't leave him with you.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.541
He's scared. Look at him.

18:03.625 --> 18:04.999
Elmer?

18:06.500 --> 18:07.792
Elmer?

18:14.625 --> 18:16.416
Does he know what that is?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.583
God in heaven, I have no idea.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.541
Has he ever seen a gun before?

18:20.625 --> 18:22.333
Oh, God...

18:24.333 --> 18:26.750
He's got a squirt gun
that I let him play with.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.416
He loves Dirty Harry movies.

18:28.500 --> 18:31.500
I don't think he's ever seen
a real one, though.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.166
Elmer?

18:35.333 --> 18:38.416
You need to put that down.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.958
- Tell him.
- Hey. Hey, buddy.

18:44.625 --> 18:45.667
Hey.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.458
Hi. You know what?

18:47.541 --> 18:48.958
I am not gonna yell at you,

18:49.041 --> 18:51.917
I'm not, but I'm gonna
ask you to give me that toy.

18:51.999 --> 18:54.500
OK, big boy?
And then Daddy's gonna...

18:54.583 --> 18:56.291
Aaaah!

18:56.375 --> 18:59.083
Oh, God! Oh, fuck! Fuck!

18:59.166 --> 19:02.583
- Are you OK?
- Oh, God, it hurts like a motherfucker!

19:02.667 --> 19:04.958
I can't feel my legs!

19:05.041 --> 19:08.041
- Jesus! OK...
- Dude! What the fuck?!

19:08.124 --> 19:11.124
I'm gonna radio backup.
You stay on the ground.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.583
You do that.

19:12.667 --> 19:16.249
Oh, fuck! It's in my purse.
The radio.

19:17.875 --> 19:21.208
OK.

19:22.375 --> 19:25.416
Yeah. Yes.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.375
It's OK, Elmer.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.875
Hey, buddy.

19:30.958 --> 19:32.667
OK.

19:32.750 --> 19:36.083
It's OK. Shh...

19:37.583 --> 19:38.833
Arrghh!!!

19:38.917 --> 19:40.708
Jesus! I said don't move!

19:40.792 --> 19:41.999
He was gonna zap you!

19:42.083 --> 19:44.041
I took the fuckin' hit for you!

19:44.124 --> 19:46.541
Oh, son of a bitch!

19:46.625 --> 19:47.999
Take it away from him!

19:48.083 --> 19:51.375
Uh, does he know
any verbal cues?

19:51.458 --> 19:53.249
- Any trigger words?
- He speaks English.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.583
Uh, OK.

19:54.667 --> 19:57.249
Elmer, please,

19:57.333 --> 19:58.917
give the pretty lady the toy.

19:58.999 --> 20:01.083
I'm begging you,
give her the toy.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.917
Oh, fuck!

20:03.999 --> 20:06.833
Allan. Allan, what?
What's happening?

20:06.917 --> 20:08.958
It's the red zone.
He's in the fuckin' red zone.

20:11.958 --> 20:15.375
OK... OK.

20:15.458 --> 20:17.208
What are you doing?

20:17.291 --> 20:19.375
Shhh!

20:19.458 --> 20:22.458
Uh, I don't think
he's gonna be...

20:29.792 --> 20:30.792
Oh. Wow.

20:30.833 --> 20:31.958
Oh, OK.

20:37.124 --> 20:42.416
That's it...
buddy, that's it, Elmer.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.958
Elmer...

20:47.375 --> 20:48.917
Elmer.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.583
There we go.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.999
That's the Elmer
that I want to see.

20:56.249 --> 21:01.291
Yeah, nice and easy,
I'm... I'm just...

21:01.375 --> 21:04.667
I'm gonna... yeah...

21:04.750 --> 21:07.166
- Arrghh!
- Elmer! No!

21:07.249 --> 21:10.208
No! Shar-Sharon.

21:10.291 --> 21:13.500
Are you OK? Sharon?

21:13.583 --> 21:14.667
Elmer, dude.

21:14.750 --> 21:18.667
Buddy... Ah, fuck.
Thank you so much.

21:22.124 --> 21:25.291
Wait. Elmer, no!

21:25.375 --> 21:26.750
No!!!

21:26.833 --> 21:29.708
Do not walk away from me!

21:42.083 --> 21:43.833
Elmer.

23:14.917 --> 23:15.917
Itchy, itchy shakes.

23:15.958 --> 23:17.124
Hey! It's me!

23:18.124 --> 23:20.124
Those itchy shakes.
