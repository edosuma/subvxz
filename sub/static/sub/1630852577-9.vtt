[cheers and applause]

00:15.382 --> 00:16.617
Jasmine.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.285
I could see you thinking
about the dance steps

00:18.285 --> 00:19.786
instead of being the character.

00:19.786 --> 00:22.189
-Kerri.
-Your body's amazing,

00:22.189 --> 00:25.792
but I don't wanna walk away
just remembering your body.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.194
I wanna walk away
remembering you.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.462
Daya Betty.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.364
Just when you needed to,

00:30.364 --> 00:31.899
you've hit the pedal
to the metal.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.200
Con-drag-ulations.

You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.370
[cheers and applause]

00:36.370 --> 00:39.773
Jasmine Kennedie,
shantay you stay.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.209
Kerri, sashay away.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.086
-Holy fuck.
-Ugh.

00:53.086 --> 00:55.455
Oh, my goodness.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.491
I feel a sense of relief

00:57.491 --> 00:59.793
because I am not
the one eliminated.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.561
But at the same time,

01:01.561 --> 01:05.432
it's a bittersweet moment
just because I sent home Kerri.

01:05.432 --> 01:09.569
"You ladies
are truly a blessing,

01:09.569 --> 01:12.272
and you each are All Stars."

01:12.272 --> 01:14.374
Kerri!

01:14.374 --> 01:16.143
That was a lot.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.678
She made me realize

01:17.678 --> 01:21.048
that you have to live your life
authentically 100% yourself,

01:21.048 --> 01:23.283
and not hold anything back.

01:23.283 --> 01:27.721
She represented
everything I wanted to be,

01:27.721 --> 01:31.491
and I was such a big fan of her
before coming in here,

01:31.491 --> 01:34.261
and I feel horrible

01:34.261 --> 01:36.363
that I was the one
that sent her home.

01:36.363 --> 01:39.999
It's just really, really hard

01:39.999 --> 01:42.336
just because I wanna be
in this competition so bad,

01:42.336 --> 01:44.304
but I do have this,
like, looming feeling

01:44.304 --> 01:48.408
of that, like,
I did something, like, wrong.

01:48.408 --> 01:52.879
Kerri is a very rare,
beautiful soul.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.114
We love you, Kerri.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.415
-We love you.
-Love you, twin.

01:55.415 --> 01:56.817
And you'll always
be in our hearts.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.785
Jasmine's really upset
to be the one

01:58.785 --> 02:00.120
that knocked Kerri out.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.022
But this is a competition,

02:02.022 --> 02:04.758
so she needs to focus
on the bigger picture

02:04.758 --> 02:07.761
and really just set her sights
on the prize.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.530
Con-drag-ulations, Miss Daya.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.065
[cheering]

02:12.065 --> 02:13.567
Finally, bitch.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.801
Yes, girl.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.036
It feels really fucking good.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.038
It feels so good!

02:18.038 --> 02:21.141
You're, like, bitch,
I wanna win something, shit.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.509
And to see you do it,

02:22.509 --> 02:25.379
I think we're all just,
like, well deserved, yeah.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.214
Well, and I hope
nobody, like, takes offense

02:27.214 --> 02:29.750
if I've come off a little
bitchy or, like, whatever.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.019
The past couple of weeks,
I'm just, like,

02:32.019 --> 02:34.154
really trying to keep my head
in the game right now, so...

02:34.154 --> 02:35.655
Girl, you're here to win.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.058
I know, and I hope
y'all bitches are here, too,

02:38.058 --> 02:39.393
you know, 'cause if you're not,

02:39.393 --> 02:40.594
then why the fuck
are you here?

02:40.594 --> 02:43.096
That's just how
I think about it, so...

02:43.096 --> 02:45.565
Daya's very open about
how competitive she is,

02:45.565 --> 02:47.300
and that's something
I appreciate,

02:47.300 --> 02:50.137
because I'm not very open
with how competitive I am.

02:50.137 --> 02:53.073
It is okay to feel
a little cutthroat at times.

02:54.274 --> 02:55.709
Is anybody surprised or confused

02:55.709 --> 02:57.277
by any of the placements
tonight?

02:57.277 --> 02:59.546
For the most part
I totally understand,

02:59.546 --> 03:01.681
like, the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.151
But the safe girls
kind of, like,

03:04.151 --> 03:06.686
we're trying to do the math
as well, and figure out,

03:06.686 --> 03:08.688
'cause, like, we did say

03:08.688 --> 03:10.323
that Miss DeJa might
have been in the bottom.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.895
The safe queens' opinions
does not matter.

03:14.895 --> 03:18.598
I met this challenge head-on,
so their opinions?

03:18.598 --> 03:20.400
It doesn't matter.
Fuck them.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.437
This is a really tight race.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.373
There's a lot of wins
on the board right now.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.242
There's six of us
that have a win right now,

03:29.242 --> 03:30.510
and Miss Angie has two.

03:30.510 --> 03:31.578
I'm the only one
that hasn't won.

03:31.578 --> 03:32.679
I haven't won either.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.314
No, you haven't won?

03:34.314 --> 03:37.050
I want a win.
I need a win.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.919
I'm hoping that I can throw

03:38.919 --> 03:40.987
some, you know,
pearls on the stage,

03:40.987 --> 03:42.589
I can trip someone.

03:42.589 --> 03:47.561
Something very subtle that
I can get away with. [laughs]

03:47.561 --> 03:51.131
I don't have, like, a strategy
mindset, I really don't.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.933
Maybe I should.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.402
Oh! Oh.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.104
I knocked over
someone's powder.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.972
I'll buy you a new one.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.740
With what, win money?
No.

I've been a mess today.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.414

04:11.718 --> 04:13.854
You fucking bitch!

04:13.854 --> 04:16.957
I think it is
an incredibly stupid idea

04:16.957 --> 04:18.358
to count anybody out.

04:18.358 --> 04:21.094
The moment you start,
like, looking past somebody

04:21.094 --> 04:23.497
is the moment you're setting
yourself up to be proven wrong

04:23.497 --> 04:25.599
and send your ass home.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.300
Read me to filth.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.536
Well, we know DeJa can't,
so can someone else?

09:30.503 --> 09:34.974
and deeply complex topic
of... menzes.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.810
-Oh!
-Ooh!

09:36.810 --> 09:38.912
-Uh-huh.
-Mens.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.247
Whether you wanna
talk about your sugar daddy,

09:41.247 --> 09:44.250
your real daddy,
your blood brothers,

09:44.250 --> 09:46.653
or your brother
from another mother,

09:46.653 --> 09:50.156
you need to lead
a dynamic discussion

09:50.156 --> 09:53.693
that's both real
and real enter-tainting.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.528
Yes, oh, my God.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.630
Now, Willow, you won
the mini-challenge,

09:57.630 --> 10:00.066
so you get to choose your team.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.067
Ooh!

10:01.067 --> 10:02.869
I'm really happy,

10:02.869 --> 10:04.771
because
I didn't wanna get stuck

10:04.771 --> 10:07.507
with a group that
I didn't want to work with.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.576
But I'm also afraid
that whoever's left

10:09.576 --> 10:11.611
is, like, oh, I'm just,
like, chopped liver.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.947
But, you know,

10:13.947 --> 10:15.949
they're gonna have to get
over it, so I don't even care.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.318
Willow, who do you choose first?

10:18.318 --> 10:22.555
Okay, I've never gotten
to work with DeJa.

10:22.555 --> 10:23.890
Yay!

10:23.890 --> 10:26.059
Willow picks me first.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.027
B-b-b-b-boom.

10:28.027 --> 10:30.697
Angie, come on over, bitch.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.099
Damn, Willow, what you
gonna do with all that ass?

10:33.099 --> 10:35.101
[all laugh]

10:35.101 --> 10:39.005
The last person I would like
to work with more is Camden.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.107
Yay!

10:41.107 --> 10:43.209
Wait, those are your choices?

10:43.209 --> 10:45.111
My thoughts exactly.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.246
[all laugh]

10:46.246 --> 10:48.781
And that means
Daya Betty, Bosco,

10:48.781 --> 10:56.122
Jasmine Kennedie, and Jorgeous,
you are on the opposing team.

10:56.122 --> 10:59.692
I have to say I have
observed Daya's face.

10:59.692 --> 11:05.298
She doesn't seem
the most excited

11:05.298 --> 11:09.135
with the people on her team.

11:10.503 --> 11:14.007
Ladies, as you prepare
your panels,

11:14.007 --> 11:16.309
each team needs to pick
one queen

11:16.309 --> 11:19.913
to act as the moderator
of your panel.

11:19.913 --> 11:25.018
Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.519
[cheering]

11:26.519 --> 11:28.688
I am a little nervous.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.458
The other team, they've all been
playing the game super strong.

11:32.458 --> 11:36.195
However, Willow puts me
in a group with Jasmine.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.664
Jasmine's like
an energy vampire,

11:37.664 --> 11:40.199
and that is not good.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.135
#TeamLeftovers.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.973
I'm fucking excited.
DragCon panel, bitch!

11:46.973 --> 11:50.176
Today's maxi-challenge
is we are actually gonna do

11:50.176 --> 11:54.948
our own DragCon panel
on the subject of menzeseseses.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.849
I don't know about anybody else,
but I love men.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.117
How about you?

11:58.117 --> 12:00.520
There's more to men
than just penis.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.623
-Not to me, but to most people.
-But to most people, yeah.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.391
So we do need to assign
a moderator.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.926
Have you thought about that?

12:06.926 --> 12:08.995
I am thinking

12:08.995 --> 12:11.464
I would like
the moderator to be you.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.300
I was thinking the same thing.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.668
Yes, I'm down.

12:15.668 --> 12:19.238
I think you're the best person
to keep us all together.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.675
So you'll be kicking off
each topic.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.744
DeJa the moderator. [laughs]

12:24.744 --> 12:26.746
Is this, like, a come up with
a character type thing,

12:26.746 --> 12:27.747
or is this, like, a--

12:27.747 --> 12:29.282
No, we're ourselves.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.617
-Yeah, ourselves.
-We're ourselves.

12:30.617 --> 12:31.951
I think the best way
I can imagine it

12:31.951 --> 12:34.153
is as if I'm talking at home

12:34.153 --> 12:35.421
-with all my friends.
-Yeah.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.689
Because I hate the three of you.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.291
[all laugh]

12:38.291 --> 12:41.060
I do feel like we have
good chemistry together.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.062
I don't see the other team

12:43.062 --> 12:46.232
as members hanging out
in their daily lives together.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.568
I'm thinking that
they might run into trouble

12:48.568 --> 12:51.504
with just general chemistry
and flow.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.374
So the idea
of, like, a panel,

12:54.374 --> 12:56.142
where does that
take you immediately?

12:56.142 --> 12:59.178
I'm thinking, like,
instructional, infomercials,

12:59.178 --> 13:00.880
and, like, Steve Jobs

13:00.880 --> 13:04.817
revealing, like, a new iPhone
type of situation.

13:04.817 --> 13:07.120
I have never been on a panel,

13:07.120 --> 13:08.888
but I'm not scared
to talk to people.

13:08.888 --> 13:12.859
I worked in customer service
since I was, like, 13.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.595
There's an art form
to being a very salty barista,

13:15.595 --> 13:18.631
and I am an extremely
salty barista.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.134
"Select a moderator
to drive the conversation."

13:21.134 --> 13:23.569
First of all,
what's a moderator?

13:23.569 --> 13:26.606
A moderator is someone
who basically, like, delegates

13:26.606 --> 13:29.542
and puts, like, the direction
of the conversation.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.144
And, like, making sure
that, like,

13:31.144 --> 13:33.212
we're engaging
with each other.

13:33.212 --> 13:36.716
If possible, I would love
to take the moderator role.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.358
No, no, no, no.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.859
Not today.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.362
No.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.265
Are you gonna be able to cut off
whenever it's not, like--

13:52.265 --> 13:54.567
you know, 'cause a moderator
just has to get to the point.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.636
Yes.
In terms of that,

13:56.636 --> 13:58.838
I'm, like, able to give you guys
rooms and things like that,

13:58.838 --> 14:00.740
and then if there's, like,
a little, like, dead space,

14:00.740 --> 14:03.676
I could always fill in time
with things like that.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.479
Here's the thing.
Jasmine knows how to talk,

14:06.479 --> 14:10.049
but a moderator also needs
to know when to stop talking.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.617
-I feel like--
-Well, it feels like--

14:11.617 --> 14:14.387
Bosco, what are you
thinking about?

14:14.387 --> 14:18.491
Right now, I am kind of feeling
the moderator role,

14:18.491 --> 14:21.060
if that isn't stepping on
anybody's toes

14:21.060 --> 14:22.729
-for the most part.
-Work.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.297
And Bosco, if you
were to open,

14:24.297 --> 14:26.599
I feel like it would be
very strong, bitch.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.635
'Cause that is what's going to
lead us in on a positive note,

14:29.635 --> 14:32.105
or we're gonna flatline fast.

14:32.105 --> 14:35.675
And I feel more comfortable
with Bosco.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.443
-No offense, Jasmine.
-No, it's okay.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.912
No, I'd rather work
collaborative as a team

14:39.912 --> 14:41.781
and make it better
than just try to take it

14:41.781 --> 14:43.116
just because I was in
the bottom two last week

14:43.116 --> 14:45.017
-and trying to, like, stand out.
-Great.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.320
It has always been
a challenge for me

14:47.320 --> 14:49.856
not to over-talk
or overrun a conversation.

14:49.856 --> 14:52.458
Since this is
a talking challenge,

14:52.458 --> 14:53.726
my biggest struggle in this

14:53.726 --> 14:55.828
is going to make sure
that I am talking enough,

14:55.828 --> 14:59.866
but I'm also not
over-talking others.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.467
Hey, mamikins.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.469
Hey, mama.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.671
Now, is it raining menzes
up in here?

15:05.671 --> 15:07.607
-Up in here!
-Oh, yes!

15:07.607 --> 15:09.642
[all laugh]

15:09.642 --> 15:10.910
Eew!

15:10.910 --> 15:12.211
[all laugh]

15:12.211 --> 15:14.213
Team Willow, come on over.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.317
So we're talking about menzes.

15:18.317 --> 15:19.619
Yes.

15:19.619 --> 15:20.720
Tell me some of the topics

15:20.720 --> 15:22.455
that you will be covering
with this panel.

15:22.455 --> 15:26.159
Well, we wanted to do a mixture
of having a lot of fun

15:26.159 --> 15:27.426
and interjecting
a lot of comedy,

15:27.426 --> 15:29.228
but also some serious stuff.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.731
So, like, fatherhood
is a great place

15:31.731 --> 15:33.566
for us to tell
about our stories,

15:33.566 --> 15:38.271
and so we wanna have a great
ebb and flow of entertainment,

15:38.271 --> 15:40.206
but also realness.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.941
Ebb and flow. They used to
live down the street from me.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.211
Yeah, they were whores.
Yeah.

15:45.211 --> 15:49.015
So what is the theses
of your father talk?

15:49.015 --> 15:50.850
What's your relationship
like with your father?

15:50.850 --> 15:52.752
-I don't talk to my father.
-Why not?

15:52.752 --> 15:56.189
When we were 14,
he up and left us.

15:56.189 --> 16:00.660
And my mother suffers with
bipolar and schizophrenia,

16:00.660 --> 16:04.864
so she couldn't take care of
herself, let alone two children.

16:04.864 --> 16:07.366
And so, who took care
of the family after that?

16:07.366 --> 16:09.535
We kind of separated.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.404
My mother and my brother
moved somewhere else,

16:11.404 --> 16:14.006
and then I was taken in
by a guardian.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.341
And he really kind of gave me

16:15.341 --> 16:17.009
the father that
I've always longed for.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.511
Yeah. Wow.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.414
So who's been to DragCon?
Raise your hand.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.882
So, Angeria, you've never been.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.150
Get the fuck out.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.151
[all laugh]

16:25.151 --> 16:27.253
Now, who's also been to panels?

16:27.253 --> 16:30.189
I've actually done
a panel before.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.525
At another Con?

16:32.525 --> 16:35.361
[all laugh]
How dare you!

16:35.361 --> 16:37.864
No, but I've done panels
in pageants.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.465
And how did that go?

16:39.465 --> 16:41.100
I did not win the category.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.635
Why didn't you win?

16:42.635 --> 16:45.938
My strategy then was to
kind of wait and then speak.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.274
The person that did win,

16:48.274 --> 16:50.343
they were more straight out
the gate, this is what I think.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.111
Well, I think that's
a good point you brought up,

16:52.111 --> 16:54.347
because a lot of times when
people are in these situations,

16:54.347 --> 16:56.816
and this comes up
for people who may be shy,

16:56.816 --> 16:59.518
you think, oh, I have to act
a certain kind of way.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.820
Just be yourself.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.256
Talk like you're talking
to your friends.

17:03.256 --> 17:07.193
It has to be fluid
and conversational.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.162
Camden, I can see

17:10.162 --> 17:13.499
there's a tentativeness
in your demeanor.

17:13.499 --> 17:16.769
What is it that you're afraid
of people finding out about you?

17:16.769 --> 17:18.104
I don't know.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.039
Like, I'm afraid of, like,
sometimes looking stupid.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.708
Okay, number one, let's just
sit on that for a minute.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.310
You don't have time
to be studying other people,

17:24.310 --> 17:25.578
what they're thinking.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.847
But we let that other voice
get in the way.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.683
Just be yourself.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.485
When you were performing
One Way or the Other,

17:32.485 --> 17:34.086
where you're doing
this thing where you...

17:34.086 --> 17:36.555
and you were interpreting
and all that stuff,

17:36.555 --> 17:37.890
connect to that.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.059
Apply that to everything,

17:40.059 --> 17:42.161
and you'll win yourself
some more fucking challenges.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.329
Yeah.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.131
This is one of those challenges

17:45.131 --> 17:48.534
where I could just recoil
and tense up and, like, bomb.

17:48.534 --> 17:50.569
I need to not do

17:50.569 --> 17:52.672
the Homer Simpson
disappearing into the bushes.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.808
This is an opportunity
for us to really get in there

17:55.808 --> 17:57.176
and look under the hood

17:57.176 --> 17:59.645
and see how this engine
of masculinity works.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.247
Still have fun with it,

18:01.247 --> 18:03.849
but make sure that people
walk away from your panel

18:03.849 --> 18:06.485
with some real,
tangible information.

18:06.485 --> 18:09.822
I feel like Ru is looking at me,
going, bitch.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.425
She's looking
for that same looseness

18:12.425 --> 18:13.793
and, like, crazy freedom

18:13.793 --> 18:16.228
that I felt I had
as Freddie Mercury.

18:16.228 --> 18:22.335
Okay, Bosco, Daya Betty,
Jorgeous, Jasmine.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.869
So we're talking about menzes.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.238
Yes, our favorite subject.

18:26.238 --> 18:28.174
I know it's your
favorite subject.

18:28.174 --> 18:31.077
What about you, Daya Betty?
Have you been in a relationship?

18:31.077 --> 18:33.612
Yeah, I've been in
a relationship for five years.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.780
With Satan?

18:34.780 --> 18:36.983
[all laugh]
With Satan, yeah, yeah.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.551
Uh-huh. What's Satan like
in bed?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.786
-Actually, not that good.
-[laughs]

18:40.786 --> 18:43.789
Very disappointing,
to be honest, Ru.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.758
Are you all getting along well?

18:45.758 --> 18:47.426
How are you two getting along?

18:47.426 --> 18:48.661
We're doing pretty good.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.963
I know, we always
are at each other's throat,

18:50.963 --> 18:52.398
-back and forth, but--
-Why is that?

18:52.398 --> 18:53.966
We're not
at each other's throat.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.234
Not-- Frenemy-ish.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.635
We're not
at each other's throat.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.070
What are you?

18:58.070 --> 19:00.406
Sometimes she just doesn't
know when to shut her mouth.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.941
Yeah, and sometimes she likes

19:01.941 --> 19:03.509
to comment on things that
don't need to be commented on.

19:03.509 --> 19:04.810
And sometimes she likes
to talk over people.

19:04.810 --> 19:05.978
-Exactly.
-Uh-huh.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.780
In a way, she's like
a little sister...

19:07.780 --> 19:10.483
-Yeah.
-That I wanna bash her head

19:10.483 --> 19:12.051
into the concrete floor.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.253
But there's a part of me
that loves her.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.022
So now this is interesting,

19:16.022 --> 19:18.124
because there's a panel where
you're all talking and stuff.

19:18.124 --> 19:22.361
How will you be able
to take a slice of the pie

19:22.361 --> 19:25.097
and then leave some
for the rest of the kids?

19:25.097 --> 19:26.599
I think it's honestly

19:26.599 --> 19:29.001
by kind of how
I'm formatting my situation.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.971
I'm gonna be not necessarily
dominating the conversation,

19:31.971 --> 19:33.539
but more kind of being, like,

19:33.539 --> 19:35.307
the person they come to
with the question,

19:35.307 --> 19:36.375
if that makes sense.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.678
Doesn't make sense.
[all laugh]

19:39.678 --> 19:42.948
Now, have you workshopped
this topic enough?

19:42.948 --> 19:45.751
You know, if you were in
Lou Grant's newsroom--

19:45.751 --> 19:48.354
don't question my reference--

19:48.354 --> 19:50.489
you would go, you know,
let's hear all the ideas,

19:50.489 --> 19:52.091
put them all on the table,
and let's sort through

19:52.091 --> 19:55.394
to find out the ones
that pack the most power.

19:55.394 --> 19:58.431
Now, this has gotta be fun,
because this is DragCon.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.133
But you have to be able
to hit some points

20:01.133 --> 20:04.537
so that the people listening
have some takeaway from this.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.239
In fact, Jorgeous, have you
learned anything about men

20:07.239 --> 20:09.775
in this workshop
that you didn't know?

20:09.775 --> 20:11.944
No, honestly.
[laughs]

20:11.944 --> 20:13.012
I would worry about that.

20:13.012 --> 20:16.048
Your relationship to femininity,

20:16.048 --> 20:18.417
it's very clear cut.

20:18.417 --> 20:19.919
Where does that come from?

20:19.919 --> 20:23.422
Ever since I was five years old
I always grew up dancing,

20:23.422 --> 20:25.591
and, like,
I watched ninja movies,

20:25.591 --> 20:29.328
and I was always in tune with my
body ever since I was younger.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.797
There's baby pictures of me
posing as a--like--

20:31.797 --> 20:33.032
I know there are.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.733
And I'm just, like,
with my hip out.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.903
Did your father say,
"Boy, don't you do that"?

20:37.903 --> 20:40.072
Yes. I used to walk around
on my tiptoes,

20:40.072 --> 20:41.507
and my grandpa and my dad

20:41.507 --> 20:43.609
used to get so mad at me
for doing that.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.311
Really?
And why do you think that is?

20:45.311 --> 20:46.645
I feel like because

20:46.645 --> 20:48.481
they didn't want me
to be feminine whatsoever.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.749
-Because?
-I don't know why.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.551
Like, I was just doing me.

20:52.551 --> 20:53.953
I was just having fun.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.321
I just felt comfortable
with myself.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.022
Now, this is good shit
right here.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.425
These are the kinds of things
I want you to workshop.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.826
I mean, this right now

21:00.826 --> 21:02.528
is an opportunity
for you to dig deep

21:02.528 --> 21:04.563
and sort it all out,
get it on the table.

21:04.563 --> 21:06.098
Give us some takeaway
with this thing.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.901
Otherwise, you might be
lip syncing this week.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.437
Ru's definitely stressing

21:11.437 --> 21:13.806
that this needs to be personal,

21:13.806 --> 21:15.341
but at the same time,

21:15.341 --> 21:18.911
she's also really stressing
that this needs to be fun.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.913
It's hard to say
how this will go.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.582
Well, thank you, ladies.
We'll talk later.

21:23.582 --> 21:24.650
-Thank you.
-Let's do it.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.919
-Thank you, Miss RuPaul.
-Thanks, Ru.

21:26.919 --> 21:30.923
I'm leaving today thinking that
this could be a moment for me.

21:30.923 --> 21:34.927
However, I don't know until
I see what my teammates do.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.796
Like, what is a moderator
without content to moderate?

21:37.796 --> 21:40.633
So this could very well
blow up in my face

21:40.633 --> 21:42.468
or be my saving grace.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.542
Maxine!

21:49.542 --> 21:50.743
[laughs]

21:50.743 --> 21:52.978
Today we get to do
our DragCon panel

21:52.978 --> 21:54.180
in front of the judges.

21:54.180 --> 21:57.049
I'm feeling so excited,
super confident.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.651
Our team is gonna
knock it out of the park.

21:58.651 --> 22:02.188
-Maxine!
-Maxine!

22:04.156 --> 22:06.525
Who's excited
that we get to do DragCon?

22:06.525 --> 22:09.395
-Yeah!
-I'm so happy about it.

22:09.395 --> 22:10.930
How are you feeling,
Miss Jasmine?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.565
I'm feeling very good.

22:12.565 --> 22:16.635
I think our group is doing
a lot better than we were.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.370
Yeah, I was very confused
at first.

22:18.370 --> 22:20.573
Yeah.
Now we kind of have an idea

22:20.573 --> 22:22.474
of how it's running
and things like that,

22:22.474 --> 22:24.043
so I just have to make sure

22:24.043 --> 22:25.911
I'm letting room
for other people to talk.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.346
And I think with
how we practiced it,

22:27.346 --> 22:28.347
I did a good job, so...

22:28.347 --> 22:30.049
Is Jasmine learning something?

22:30.049 --> 22:31.850
Am I growing
and developing?

22:31.850 --> 22:33.419
-Oh, my God.
-What is this?

22:33.419 --> 22:35.120
I don't think my team

22:35.120 --> 22:37.923
has the utmost confidence in me
in this challenge,

22:37.923 --> 22:39.858
but I am very much for the team,

22:39.858 --> 22:43.963
and I am going to take
the critiques and dial it back.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.365
I feel like I am
on the right track.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.100
Something I've definitely,
like, learned a lot

22:48.100 --> 22:49.635
from, like, creating,

22:49.635 --> 22:52.037
is to not get attached
to anything.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.973
If something's
not working, drop it.

22:53.973 --> 22:58.043
Your brain is capable
of coming up with new ideas.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.412
I definitely learned that
being here, honestly.

23:00.412 --> 23:02.881
'Cause, like, bitch,
we rehearse something

23:02.881 --> 23:04.984
or practice something,
it never...

23:04.984 --> 23:06.418
-Turns out?
-Yes.

23:06.418 --> 23:09.088
Sometimes when I get in front
of a mic,

23:09.088 --> 23:11.190
I get hella flustered,
I get hella nervous.

23:11.190 --> 23:14.927
But, honestly,
the head bitch is Bosco,

23:14.927 --> 23:17.229
and, bitch, we got Jasmine,
we got Daya,

23:17.229 --> 23:18.931
and we got me,
a whole group of bad bitches.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.599
So we got this.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.570
So I'm wearing, like,
a dark red wig,

23:24.570 --> 23:26.538
and I feel like I'm gonna
look like my mum today.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.207
-Love that for you.
-Like my actual mum.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.542
Do you feel like you
look like your mom at all

23:30.542 --> 23:31.944
when you're in drag sometimes?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.512
Yeah, the first time
I got in drag,

23:33.512 --> 23:34.947
a lot of my mum's friends
were, like,

23:34.947 --> 23:37.182
"Oh, my God, you are
your mother."

23:37.182 --> 23:38.917
"You are your mother."

23:38.917 --> 23:40.986
-You are your--
-"I am your father!"

23:40.986 --> 23:42.721
And I am your faja!

23:42.721 --> 23:43.856
[all laugh]

23:43.856 --> 23:45.457
And I have to say, Willow,

23:45.457 --> 23:47.493
like, thank you so much
for choosing us.

23:47.493 --> 23:49.328
-Yes.
-Because honestly, like,

23:49.328 --> 23:51.130
I've been wanting to work
with you for a while.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.265
You do a great job, and you know
what I like about you a lot?

23:53.265 --> 23:54.667
Tell me what you like about me.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.368
I am.
I'm gonna tell you.

23:56.368 --> 23:59.271
I really like that
you are quiet,

23:59.271 --> 24:03.242
but you do not, like,
play the back, though.

24:03.242 --> 24:04.310
Like, you're still
gonna have a voice.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.711
-Yeah.
-I think you realize

24:05.711 --> 24:08.247
you don't have to be
the loudest person in the room,

24:08.247 --> 24:10.516
you know, to still make a point.

24:10.516 --> 24:11.950
I feel no need to bark.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.086
Yes.
I noticed that about you.

24:14.086 --> 24:18.290
I want another win so bad.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.726
I wasn't even happy,
like, being safe last week.

24:20.726 --> 24:23.962
I wanna be back on top,
and I feel confident this week.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.631
I just--I need
to bag another one.

24:31.036 --> 24:33.872
See the drag queens
in their natural habitat,

24:33.872 --> 24:37.176
undisturbed, quiet as a mouse.

24:37.176 --> 24:42.848
As the eyeliner applies
and the lash attaches,

24:42.848 --> 24:46.051
careful, as not to disturb her.

24:47.419 --> 24:52.157
I don't like you
as you look so creepy at me.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.159
Quiet.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.794
Careful not to disturb.

24:55.794 --> 24:58.063
-[belch]
-Oh!

24:58.063 --> 24:59.598
-Wow.
-Was that Lady?

24:59.598 --> 25:01.133
That was Willow.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.368
That's not a lady,
that's Godzilla.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.770
-[laughs]
-That's Godwillow.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.772
Y'all bitches are crazy.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.407
Maxine!

25:08.407 --> 25:09.808

25:20.686 --> 25:23.021

25:29.728 --> 25:32.931
♪ Head to toe,

25:32.931 --> 25:34.700
-Yes, Dynasty.
-Yes!

25:34.700 --> 25:36.502
And what?

25:36.502 --> 25:39.471
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

25:39.471 --> 25:42.408
She's never met a man
she didn't like.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.809
Michelle Visage.

25:43.809 --> 25:48.147
Well, there was this one guy
years ago in New Jersey

25:48.147 --> 25:50.649
in a park at night
under the jungle gym.

25:50.649 --> 25:55.387
Now, I didn't get his name,
so let's just call him Floppy.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.688
[laughs]

25:56.688 --> 25:59.625
Style superstar Carson Kressley.

25:59.625 --> 26:02.728
Now, Carson, what's your
favorite thing about men?

26:02.728 --> 26:03.796
Yes.

26:03.796 --> 26:06.865
[all laugh]

26:06.865 --> 26:08.667
You learned that
from Zsa Zsa.

26:08.667 --> 26:09.802
I sure did.

26:09.802 --> 26:13.639
And the men all pause
for Nicole Byer.

26:13.639 --> 26:16.275
Nicole, what's your favorite
thing about men?

26:16.275 --> 26:18.210
-Dick.
-[laughs]

26:18.210 --> 26:20.512
Well, what qualities
do you look for in a man?

26:20.512 --> 26:23.081
-Dick.
-[laughs]

26:23.081 --> 26:25.150
Who's your favorite Van Dyke?

26:25.150 --> 26:26.752
-Oh.
-Dick.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.887
[laughs]

26:28.887 --> 26:30.389
This week
we challenged our queens

26:30.389 --> 26:31.623
to info-taint us

26:31.623 --> 26:35.194
in DragCon panel discussions
about menzes.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.896
Racers, start your engines,

26:37.896 --> 26:39.965
and may the best drag queen win.

26:41.467 --> 26:45.337
RuPaul's DragCon
presents our first panel.

26:45.337 --> 26:46.738
[applause]

26:46.738 --> 26:48.640
Well, hello,
and welcome to our panel.

26:48.640 --> 26:51.109
Men: A Work in Progress.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.277
Now, we're gonna be talking

26:52.277 --> 26:55.481
about the good, the bad,
and the ugly.

26:55.481 --> 26:57.716
Speaking of ugly, do you
wanna meet our panelists?

26:57.716 --> 26:59.017
[all laugh]

26:59.017 --> 27:00.819
We have Miss Lady Camden.

27:00.819 --> 27:03.088
Hello, you sexy bitches.

27:03.088 --> 27:04.723
We have Miss Wiwwow Piww.

27:04.723 --> 27:05.891
Hello, darlings.

27:05.891 --> 27:07.226
And of course, Miss Angeria.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.294
But you can call me Angie.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.362
[all laugh]

27:10.362 --> 27:12.130
Now, the topics at hand,

27:12.130 --> 27:13.966
we are gonna be talking
about hot mens.

27:13.966 --> 27:19.071
Mm-hmm. Fatherhood,
and relationships and sex.

27:19.071 --> 27:22.975
So let me tell you, ladies,
what makes a man sexy?

27:22.975 --> 27:25.878
Now, I can say for me,
I love body hair.

27:25.878 --> 27:29.748
I like to be exfoliated
when I'm giving him--

27:29.748 --> 27:30.849
A hug?

27:30.849 --> 27:32.417
A hug, yes.
[all laugh]

27:32.417 --> 27:33.619
I've heard you give great hugs.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.687
That's exactly what
I was gonna go for.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.589
Now, Willow, what makes
a man sexy to you?

27:37.589 --> 27:40.058
Well, it's complicated for me,
because I'm an anarchist

27:40.058 --> 27:41.326
who believes men
should be punished

27:41.326 --> 27:42.461
for their crimes
against the world,

27:42.461 --> 27:44.162
but I do find them
very attractive.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.797
Okay. Okay.
[all laugh]

27:45.797 --> 27:47.866
So I really like
a feminine man.

27:47.866 --> 27:49.034
And in the gay community,

27:49.034 --> 27:50.602
there's this whole
masc-for-masc thing,

27:50.602 --> 27:52.070
which if you don't know,

27:52.070 --> 27:54.506
means a masculine man looking
for another masculine man,

27:54.506 --> 27:55.607
like Ross and Carson.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.075
Yes, yes.
[all laugh]

27:57.075 --> 27:58.710
But I like femininity.

27:58.710 --> 28:01.847
There are people that actually
like to call me a drag lesbian,

28:01.847 --> 28:04.116
because I actually like
to date other drag queens.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.183
Oh, kiki to kaikai.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.585
Yeah, it's something
that I think

28:06.585 --> 28:09.755
is so sexy about a man
that I could share a wig with.

28:09.755 --> 28:10.923
[all laugh]
It really is.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.424
Now let's do something fun.

28:12.424 --> 28:14.459
Who is your celebrity crush?

28:14.459 --> 28:16.028
Blake Lively.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.363
Blake...that's a...

28:18.363 --> 28:19.631
You mean Blake Shelton?

28:19.631 --> 28:21.500
Oh. Blake Shelton.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.936
[all laugh]

28:23.936 --> 28:26.104
You didn't even get
the man's name right.

28:27.172 --> 28:28.640
Aah!

28:28.640 --> 28:30.342
I love Dwayne
"The Rock" Johnson.

28:30.342 --> 28:33.178
-Baby!
-Yes!

28:33.178 --> 28:36.615
I need a man that can handle
a loveseat or a futon or two,

28:36.615 --> 28:38.016
if you know what I mean.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.618
I have noticed
in the recent years, though,

28:39.618 --> 28:44.556
dad bod has kind of become
the quintessential ideal body,

28:44.556 --> 28:47.459
and that's gonna lead me
to fatherhood.

28:47.459 --> 28:48.961
Now, Miss Angeria,

28:48.961 --> 28:50.762
how was your relationship
with your father?

28:50.762 --> 28:54.266
Well, I actually have an amazing
relationship with my dad.

28:54.266 --> 28:57.970
He's accepted me being gay
and doing drag,

28:57.970 --> 29:01.540
and that is a lot,
especially where I come from.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.141
You know, I'm from Sparta,
Georgia, baby,

29:03.141 --> 29:04.676
and that is very rare,

29:04.676 --> 29:06.945
and I just feel like
there are men out there

29:06.945 --> 29:10.182
who are led to believe
that loving your gay child

29:10.182 --> 29:12.451
somehow makes you
less masculine.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.519
Well, I'm here to tell you
that it does not.

29:14.519 --> 29:16.722
Period.
What about you, Willow?

29:16.722 --> 29:18.523
Well, my dad died
when I was 11.

29:18.523 --> 29:20.459
-Oh, babe.
-And it was hard

29:20.459 --> 29:22.461
because we'd had
a rocky relationship.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.996
I could tell that
he knew that I was gay.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.398
And it's not hard
when, you know,

29:26.398 --> 29:28.600
I'd run around wearing
a sequined headband as a bra.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.868
Does it still fit?

29:29.868 --> 29:31.970
Yeah, I wore it
for my entrance.

29:31.970 --> 29:33.305
Completely.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.173
I just wanna say to, like,
any parents out there,

29:35.173 --> 29:37.309
don't wait
to embrace your child

29:37.309 --> 29:39.244
or figure out
what's going on with them.

29:39.244 --> 29:40.412
Just do it now.

29:40.412 --> 29:41.813
'Cause there might not
be a later.

29:41.813 --> 29:43.448
Life took that away
from me and my dad.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.716
What about you, Camden?

29:44.716 --> 29:46.351
You know, I'll admit

29:46.351 --> 29:49.388
I definitely hid
a lot of who I am

29:49.388 --> 29:50.956
from my dad from a young age.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.991
And so I always
lived in this fear

29:52.991 --> 29:55.160
of what he would say,
what he was thinking.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.897
So I almost trained myself
to be cautious.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.265
A lot of those feelings
came back up

30:00.265 --> 30:01.533
when I started to do drag.

30:01.533 --> 30:02.968
I felt very, like,

30:02.968 --> 30:05.337
I don't want him
to know who this is.

30:05.337 --> 30:06.972
When he found out,
he called me up

30:06.972 --> 30:09.975
and he said, "I love you,

30:09.975 --> 30:13.078
but I'm so heartbroken
that you held this from me."

30:13.078 --> 30:15.681
So I think sometimes
it's up to the child

30:15.681 --> 30:19.484
to be open and willing
and ready to receive that love,

30:19.484 --> 30:21.687
'cause sometimes your fear
is holding you back,

30:21.687 --> 30:23.422
which it was for me, so...

30:23.422 --> 30:24.756
I actually do not have

30:24.756 --> 30:26.425
a relationship
with my father at all.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.695
I do remember specifically
I was eight years old,

30:29.695 --> 30:31.997
and I remember
calling a boy cute.

30:31.997 --> 30:36.435
My dad chased me
around the yard, beat my ass,

30:36.435 --> 30:38.970
and told me, "You do not
say that about a boy,

30:38.970 --> 30:40.672
because I'm not gonna raise
a pussy."

30:40.672 --> 30:42.774
And that stuck with me

30:42.774 --> 30:45.477
up until maybe
I was 18 when I came out,

30:45.477 --> 30:48.613
even though the world knew,
hello, I am gay.

30:48.613 --> 30:50.248
And I'm so glad we're
having this conversation,

30:50.248 --> 30:52.851
because it's not
the child's responsibility

30:52.851 --> 30:54.486
to make their parent
feel comfortable.

30:54.486 --> 30:57.556
Also, I wanna see
more dads in drag.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.726
Yes, yes, more drag queens
that look like DeJa.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.694
Yes.
[all laugh]

31:02.694 --> 31:05.597
Now, who's single?

31:05.597 --> 31:08.200
Oh, okay, we all lonely.
Got it.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.035
Now, Willow,
is this by choice?

31:10.035 --> 31:12.671
Yeah, I mean, I've never had sex
or been in a relationship

31:12.671 --> 31:13.939
because I only do anal.

31:13.939 --> 31:16.074
Okay.
[all laugh]

31:16.074 --> 31:18.810
No, on a serious note,
I do find dating difficult,

31:18.810 --> 31:21.646
because out of drag, I'm not
a very confident person.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.181
I have a chronic illness,

31:23.181 --> 31:24.750
and it makes me look
really young

31:24.750 --> 31:26.551
and a little, like, sickly.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.886
So I feel like out of drag,

31:27.886 --> 31:29.855
I look like a sad
Victorian doll.

31:29.855 --> 31:32.190
And then in drag, I look like
a sad Victorian doll,

31:32.190 --> 31:33.992
but with whore makeup.

31:33.992 --> 31:35.761
And then I also have
a disability

31:35.761 --> 31:37.195
in my fingers and my wrists,

31:37.195 --> 31:40.766
so I give really bad handjobs,
which is tragic.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.100
-I heard that about you.
-Yeah.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.236
You know something that
I think is so difficult

31:44.236 --> 31:45.737
about dating these days?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.038
Hooking up.

31:47.038 --> 31:49.274
And I think it's because

31:49.274 --> 31:51.309
you don't see many men
working for it.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.945
Getting sex these days
is like ordering a pizza.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.080
You just call it in

31:55.080 --> 31:56.515
and it shows up
at your door 15 minutes,

31:56.515 --> 31:58.683
hot and ready.
[all laugh]

31:58.683 --> 32:01.486
All right, let's open the floor
for some final thoughts.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.255
Well, we called this
Men: A Work in Progress

32:03.255 --> 32:04.589
because it really is.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.325
I mean, this is all fun
to talk and joke about,

32:07.325 --> 32:10.762
but this is gonna be work
for generations to come,

32:10.762 --> 32:13.131
so that the people coming
don't have to feel

32:13.131 --> 32:15.867
a lot of this pain
that we've talked about it.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.769
And we talk about it
in a fun, humorous way,

32:17.769 --> 32:19.204
but the pain really is there,

32:19.204 --> 32:21.940
and we don't want that
for the rest of the world.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.742
-Not at all.
-It's gonna take a lot of work.

32:23.742 --> 32:26.978
And to my dads out there
that are listening,

32:26.978 --> 32:31.016
man up, take responsibility,
and love your child.

32:31.016 --> 32:32.851
And if you need a date,
call DeJa.

32:32.851 --> 32:34.619
[all laugh]

32:34.619 --> 32:36.321
And if you're Blake Lively,
don't call me.

32:36.321 --> 32:38.623
Don't call Camden.
[all laugh]

32:38.623 --> 32:39.758
Well, thank you guys so much

32:39.758 --> 32:42.427
for joining us
for our DragCon panel.

32:42.427 --> 32:43.762
I wanna thank our panelists.

32:43.762 --> 32:46.965
Thank you guys, Camden,
Willow, and Angeria,

32:46.965 --> 32:48.900
and, of course, I was your host,
Miss DeJa Skye.

32:48.900 --> 32:52.003
Good night.
[applause]

32:52.003 --> 32:55.807
I think that my team
knocked it out of the park.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.443
I don't know what the other team
finna be giving,

32:58.443 --> 33:01.580
but they definitely got
some competition on this one.

33:03.415 --> 33:07.886
RuPaul's DragCon
presents our next panel.

33:07.886 --> 33:10.288
Welcome to the second panel
of the day,

33:10.288 --> 33:13.124
Men: Electric Boogaloo
Part II,

33:13.124 --> 33:15.260
now with more men.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.895
[all laugh]

33:16.895 --> 33:19.331
When I think of men,
so many questions come to mind.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.466
Questions like, why?

33:21.466 --> 33:23.034
[all laugh]

33:23.034 --> 33:25.136
For what?

33:25.136 --> 33:27.672
And honestly?

33:27.672 --> 33:29.507
So I'm gonna need
a little bit of help.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.009
Let's meet our panel.

33:31.009 --> 33:35.647
We have the multifaceted yet
complex talents of Daya Betty.

33:35.647 --> 33:36.915
Thank you for that introduction.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.250
You're so welcome.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.319
The incredibly quiet
and subtle Jasmine Kennedie.

33:41.319 --> 33:43.521
Who, me?
Hi, y'all.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.090
And maybe she's born with it,

33:45.090 --> 33:46.892
or maybe she's born for this.

33:46.892 --> 33:48.193
It's Jorgeous.
[all laugh]

33:48.193 --> 33:49.661
Hello-teous!

33:49.661 --> 33:53.465
And I will be your
moderator today, Bosco.

33:53.465 --> 33:56.635
Let's talk about
how men navigate the world

33:56.635 --> 34:00.038
in a section I'd like to call
you've got male...privilege.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.407
[all laugh]

34:02.407 --> 34:04.609
Jasmine, do you think
it's easier for men than--

34:04.609 --> 34:06.011
Oh, my God, yes.

34:06.011 --> 34:09.748
Oh, my God, men have it
so much easier than women.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.116
I can go on a tangent,

34:11.116 --> 34:12.417
but I'm gonna keep it
short and sweet for y'all.

34:12.417 --> 34:14.552
-Thank God.
-[laughs]

34:14.552 --> 34:16.755
But basically, male privilege
is kind of this thing

34:16.755 --> 34:19.291
that's kind of fundamental
in society.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.593
It's taught to us
at a very, very young age.

34:21.593 --> 34:23.528
If you could take it back
to, like, middle school,

34:23.528 --> 34:25.563
men have the privilege
to kind of wear

34:25.563 --> 34:27.098
and get to do
whatever they wanted to do.

34:27.098 --> 34:31.970
But women, I mean, God forbid
if they wore a spaghetti strap

34:31.970 --> 34:33.972
or a skirt a little too low.

34:33.972 --> 34:36.274
You know, I think
right now in society

34:36.274 --> 34:37.842
we put too much pressure
on how women--

34:37.842 --> 34:40.879
or children or women
are supposed to look.

34:40.879 --> 34:43.181
Like, the dress code
isn't there technically,

34:43.181 --> 34:45.116
so I think
it should really be taught

34:45.116 --> 34:47.319
that a woman can wear
whatever she wants,

34:47.319 --> 34:48.453
and she shouldn't
be judged for it.

34:48.453 --> 34:50.989
I remember being at parties,

34:50.989 --> 34:54.059
hearing guys talk about,
you know, their numbers,

34:54.059 --> 34:55.593
how many girls they slept with.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.095
And everyone was rallying
around them,

34:57.095 --> 34:59.597
being like, "Yeah, bro,"
you know, that kind of thing.

34:59.597 --> 35:02.167
And if a girl
were to be doing that,

35:02.167 --> 35:04.035
she was slut-shamed immediately.

35:04.035 --> 35:07.906
And that's kind of something
that is taught at a young age

35:07.906 --> 35:09.975
and brought into adulthood,
unfortunately.

35:09.975 --> 35:11.376
Oh, so what we're trying to say

35:11.376 --> 35:14.112
is this is something that
follows them from boys to men.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.081
Nineties dab.
[all laugh]

35:16.081 --> 35:18.650
I don't think every man
is just, like, walking around,

35:18.650 --> 35:21.820
like, utilizing their
male privilege as a weapon.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.054
I feel like a lot of it

35:23.054 --> 35:25.156
comes from, like,
a societal expectation,

35:25.156 --> 35:28.126
and I feel like sometimes that
expectation is internalized

35:28.126 --> 35:32.330
and turns into something that
Britney Spears might call toxic,

35:32.330 --> 35:34.132
which is gonna bring us
to our next topic,

35:34.132 --> 35:36.634
which is toxic masculinity.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.036
I feel like drag queens

35:38.036 --> 35:41.473
have a very nuanced relationship
with toxic masculinity.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.241
Jorgeous, I wanna talk to you
in particular.

35:43.241 --> 35:44.943
You've told me
that your dad is, like,

35:44.943 --> 35:47.245
a really big fan of you
and your drag.

35:47.245 --> 35:49.714
Has he always been so supportive
of your feminine side?

35:49.714 --> 35:52.317
Honestly, I knew about
toxic masculini--

35:52.317 --> 35:54.853
toxic masculinity
at a very young age.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.722
I mean, when my mom
was crowning with me,

35:57.722 --> 36:00.825
little did she know she was
gonna get a big old queen.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.328
And I used to walk around
my house on my tiptoes,

36:03.328 --> 36:05.296
with my hip out,
dancing all over the place,

36:05.296 --> 36:08.500
and my dad and grandpa
really tried to suppress that

36:08.500 --> 36:09.667
at a really young age,

36:09.667 --> 36:11.636
and I never really
understood why

36:11.636 --> 36:15.173
until doing this panel
and being here at DragCon.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.475
It was all out of fear.

36:17.475 --> 36:21.146
And honestly, he came
to one of my shows,

36:21.146 --> 36:23.848
he saw how happy it made me,

36:23.848 --> 36:27.218
he saw that the people that
I was around were so positive,

36:27.218 --> 36:29.854
and he saw the money
that I was making, too,

36:29.854 --> 36:31.289
to take care of myself.

36:31.289 --> 36:32.991
And after the show,
he was like,

36:32.991 --> 36:34.492
"You know what?
That's my boy."

36:34.492 --> 36:36.094
Like, "I'm so
very proud of him."

36:36.094 --> 36:37.762
When I came out,
my parents

36:37.762 --> 36:39.497
were like, "Okay,
we can still love you,

36:39.497 --> 36:41.299
but, like,
don't talk about it."

36:41.299 --> 36:42.700
My dad in particular was like,

36:42.700 --> 36:44.402
"Don't talk about it.
I don't want you to be unsafe.

36:44.402 --> 36:46.304
I don't want your siblings
to be unsafe."

36:46.304 --> 36:48.573
And I feel like that came
from a place of fear,

36:48.573 --> 36:51.376
and that made him feel
insecure in his masculinity,

36:51.376 --> 36:54.045
and it made him feel
scared for me.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.214
And, like, I feel like my dad's,
like, on the right track.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.149
Like, he loves me,
he's supportive,

36:58.149 --> 37:00.051
but, like, he's still
not quite there.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.620
Like, he still calls drag
my dancing.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.956
He hasn't gone to my shows.

37:04.956 --> 37:07.258
So I feel like drag is, like,

37:07.258 --> 37:09.661
the antidote to this
toxic masculinity, though.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.463
I think he just needs
to see all of this,

37:11.463 --> 37:15.033
and then, like, we'll really
get to that next step.

37:15.033 --> 37:17.035
Bitch, if you're toxitive--
toxic and masculine, bitch,

37:17.035 --> 37:18.470
meet me outside
in the parking lot.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.138
I have a couple words
for y'all.

37:20.138 --> 37:21.940
She's small and feisty!
You better werk!

37:21.940 --> 37:23.541
Well, I feel like
we've spent a lot of time

37:23.541 --> 37:25.577
kind of bashing on men so far,
so I wanna flip this around.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.811
Sorry 'bout it.

37:26.811 --> 37:28.646
So we've talked about turn-offs.

37:28.646 --> 37:31.516
Let's take this to turn-ons
for our final segment.

37:31.516 --> 37:35.753
Hot menzeseses.
I believe that's plural.

37:35.753 --> 37:40.558
Let's turn this over to our
resident dick dog, Daya Betty.

37:40.558 --> 37:41.960
That's me!
Yes, thank you.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.161
Yeah, you're an expert
on this, girl.

37:43.161 --> 37:44.896
-Thank you.
-Tell me what turns you on.

37:44.896 --> 37:49.000
Well, okay, the first turn-on
I remember was watching WWE.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.902
You got the Chris Jerichos,

37:50.902 --> 37:54.205
the Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson,
DeJa.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.240
You know, John Cena.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.609
I was always so enthralled

37:57.609 --> 37:59.777
watching them on the TV,

37:59.777 --> 38:03.414
getting nose-to-nose,
drenched in sweat.

38:03.414 --> 38:05.350
You know, they wore
little, tiny outfits,

38:05.350 --> 38:08.953
and I always noticed
they had rock-hard nipples.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.122
-Okay.
-I made it my mission.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.790
Like, the first week in college,

38:12.790 --> 38:16.294
I'm like, I'm gonna find
my WWE Smackdown wrestler.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.396
Now, right now,
at this point of my life,

38:18.396 --> 38:22.467
I need a man with a mind
like Bill Nye the Science Guy,

38:22.467 --> 38:26.004
and then someone with nipples
like Carson Kressley.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.640
[all laugh]
Thank you for noticing.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.042
Jasmine, what about you,
my friend?

38:31.042 --> 38:32.110
My turn-ons?
Oh, my God.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.244
Yeah, tell me
what turns you on.

38:33.244 --> 38:34.445
I mean, I know
this is, like, geeky,

38:34.445 --> 38:35.947
but I love a gamer.

38:35.947 --> 38:39.551
I love someone who gets down,
you know, at 12:00 at night,

38:39.551 --> 38:40.919
just gaming all night.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.354
It's just, like, I don't know,
it's my favorite.

38:43.354 --> 38:44.889
-Miss Jorgeous?
-Oh, my God.

38:44.889 --> 38:46.357
Tell me about your turn-ons.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.859
I love a guy
who's way taller than me.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.627
I like to feel small
and itty-bitty.

38:49.627 --> 38:51.396
How are you gonna find a guy
taller than you?

38:51.396 --> 38:52.830
[all laugh]

38:52.830 --> 38:54.799
You're really asking
for the world over here.

38:54.799 --> 38:57.635
But I love my guys with...
[speaking Spanish].

38:57.635 --> 38:59.370
You know?

38:59.370 --> 39:02.073
I like my guys a little bit,
like, heftier and furrier.

39:02.073 --> 39:03.474
Like, if y'all
are building a man,

39:03.474 --> 39:05.176
I'm building a bear, for sure.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.945
Like, that's what does it
for me.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.647
I like somebody who's like
a loveseat that walks around.

39:09.647 --> 39:10.915
[all laugh]

39:10.915 --> 39:13.851
Thank you so much for
joining us for our panel,

39:13.851 --> 39:17.021
Men: Electric Boogaloo II,
now with more men.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.022
Ooh!

39:18.022 --> 39:19.257
My name is Bosco.

39:19.257 --> 39:21.626
We have Jorgeous,
Jasmine, and Daya Betty.

39:21.626 --> 39:22.760
Thank you so much.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.230
Thank y'all.
Thank y'all so much!

39:27.365 --> 39:31.402
♪ The world is your runway ♪

39:31.402 --> 39:35.173
Category is Shoulder Pads.

39:35.173 --> 39:37.609
Up first, DeJa Skye.

39:37.609 --> 39:40.812
Whoo, girl,
she plays linebacker

39:40.812 --> 39:43.715
for Team Coco Chanel, darling.

39:43.715 --> 39:47.485
DeJa: I am giving a nod
to Chanel,

39:47.485 --> 39:50.788
a nod to linebackers.
[laughs]

39:50.788 --> 39:53.258
I'm trying not to walk
like the Tin Man,

39:53.258 --> 39:55.226
because the jacket
is very stiff.

39:55.226 --> 40:01.165
I feel absolutely silly
and slammin'.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.601
I'm talkin' square bids
to you, baby.

40:03.601 --> 40:07.472
I own 51%
of this football team.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.340
[all laugh]

40:09.340 --> 40:10.608
Lady Camden.

40:10.608 --> 40:11.843
Nicole: A nutcracker.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.177
That's what they called me
in high school.

40:13.177 --> 40:17.181
[laughs] Get those nutcrackers
away from my face!

40:17.181 --> 40:18.449
Lady Camden: I am giving you

40:18.449 --> 40:21.085
every ballet dancer's
nightmare,

40:21.085 --> 40:23.788
The Nutcracker! Yes!

40:23.788 --> 40:26.157
I'm transforming from
little old man nutcracker

40:26.157 --> 40:29.460
to beautiful
temptress of the night.

40:29.460 --> 40:33.998
I am just glistening,
glittering, new set of lips.

40:33.998 --> 40:37.402
When all are asleep and
there's no noise in the house,

40:37.402 --> 40:39.137
not even a peep from a mouse,

40:39.137 --> 40:43.608
she comes to life, honey,
and she comes after your man!

40:43.608 --> 40:46.244
RuPaul: Honey, she's going
to epaulette you have it!

40:46.244 --> 40:47.912
[Carson laughs]

40:47.912 --> 40:49.280
RuPaul: Willow Pill.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.849
Carson: Apparently,
the stock market has spiked.

40:51.849 --> 40:54.218
[RuPaul laughs]

40:54.218 --> 40:55.787
Willow: I wanted
to bring a look

40:55.787 --> 40:59.824
that was, like,
menswear in the year 2079.

40:59.824 --> 41:02.694
It's like I'm the manager
of an evil pop group

41:02.694 --> 41:03.895
that's taking over the world,

41:03.895 --> 41:05.930
and our name
is Willow and the Pills,

41:05.930 --> 41:08.299
something that screams
edge and punk

41:08.299 --> 41:10.802
and is equally in the past
and in the future.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.404
It's business,
it's sex, it's power,

41:13.404 --> 41:16.207
and, of course, there's
always an element of camp.

41:16.207 --> 41:19.777
RuPaul: Yes, honey, I think
she's on those Willow red pills.

41:19.777 --> 41:22.513
Carson:
Attaché, you stay.

41:22.513 --> 41:23.915
[RuPaul laughs]

41:23.915 --> 41:26.417
RuPaul: Angeria.

41:26.417 --> 41:27.852
Shoulder pads, check.

41:27.852 --> 41:30.988
Houndstooth, check.
Crown, check.

41:30.988 --> 41:33.491
Nicole:
Ooh, I'm seeing a pattern here.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.426
Angeria: I wanna show
the judges right now

41:35.426 --> 41:37.962
that I can go all the way
outside of my box.

41:37.962 --> 41:42.934
So I am giving you a full
Club Kid houndstooth fantasy.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.235
I done put on me

41:44.235 --> 41:47.004
a nice, sickening
black lip for the kids.

41:47.004 --> 41:50.108
I really want to sell
this whole fantasy.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.776
Michelle:
Who let the hounds out?

41:51.776 --> 41:54.746
Who, who, who, who?

41:54.746 --> 41:55.847
RuPaul: Bosco.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.216
Carson: When it rains,
it whores.

41:58.216 --> 42:02.553
Bosco: My shoulder pad look
is neon Blade Runner.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.789
I'm feeling
very futuristic '80s.

42:04.789 --> 42:07.425
I've got my Dragon Ball Z
shoulder pads on.

42:07.425 --> 42:10.027
It's like if the Morton
salt girl, Dick Tracy,

42:10.027 --> 42:13.297
and a villain
from Power Rangers

42:13.297 --> 42:15.400
got rolled all into one look.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.635
RuPaul: Ladies and gentlemen,
Dale Bozzio.

42:17.635 --> 42:20.071
Michelle: Nobody walks in L.A.

42:20.071 --> 42:22.807
Carson: I'll see you
on The Weather Channel.

42:22.807 --> 42:24.242
RuPaul: Jorgeous.

42:24.242 --> 42:27.578
Michelle:
She wore blue sequins.

42:27.578 --> 42:30.014
Carson: Pomp-adorable.

42:30.014 --> 42:33.251
Jorgeous: Bitch, I'm giving you
Selena meets Prince.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.319
I'm giving you
pompadour realness.

42:35.319 --> 42:37.255
Natural edges, of course.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.991
I'm giving you
some of the Selena moves.

42:39.991 --> 42:43.528
Girl, I'm living my best
Selena fantasy right now.

42:43.528 --> 42:45.463
Y'all can't tell me nothing
at this point.

42:45.463 --> 42:48.065
Nicole: I guess Blue's clue
was it's stunning.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.067
[RuPaul laughs]

42:50.067 --> 42:51.803

42:51.803 --> 42:53.838

The puce is loose.

42:53.838 --> 42:55.907

42:55.907 --> 42:58.910
Ooh, dayglo she betta do!

42:58.910 --> 43:02.447
Jasmine: Today, I'm giving you
very supermodel, very serious,

43:02.447 --> 43:06.384
hands on hips, smug face,
just mean-mugging the judges,

43:06.384 --> 43:08.553
letting them know
that I can do simplicity.

43:08.553 --> 43:10.721
I don't have
all the accoutrements

43:10.721 --> 43:12.356
and accessories
going on right now.

43:12.356 --> 43:14.392
I'm giving you
Power Puff Girl villain,

43:14.392 --> 43:16.227
and I am just letting them know

43:16.227 --> 43:18.596
that I am not taking
anybody's bullshit.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.698
Radio-attractive.

43:20.698 --> 43:21.799
[RuPaul laughs]

43:21.799 --> 43:24.335
RuPaul: Reclaiming her lime.

43:24.335 --> 43:26.370
Reclaiming her lime.

43:26.370 --> 43:27.839
[Michelle laughs]

43:27.839 --> 43:29.941
RuPaul: Daya Betty.

43:29.941 --> 43:31.142
Michelle: Tank Girl!

43:31.142 --> 43:33.377
Carson: Mad Maxine.

43:33.377 --> 43:35.079
Michelle:
Don't ask, do tell.

43:35.079 --> 43:37.949
Daya: I stomp down the runway

43:37.949 --> 43:41.619
looking like a really fierce
G.I. Joe doll

43:41.619 --> 43:44.555
mixed with a gladiator bitch
from hell.

43:44.555 --> 43:46.023
Ooh, you might need that.

43:46.023 --> 43:48.926
I love a little bit
of androgyny with my look.

43:48.926 --> 43:51.596
Bitchy Betty
is tough and ready.

43:51.596 --> 43:54.699
Michelle: She's enlisted
in the hair force.

43:54.699 --> 43:57.401
RuPaul: Uh-huh.
Reporting for duty, G.I. Ho.

43:59.437 --> 44:00.905
Welcome, ladies.

44:00.905 --> 44:03.107
This week
you competed as teams,

44:03.107 --> 44:07.044
but tonight you'll be judged
as individuals.

44:09.714 --> 44:11.549
Now, when I call your name,
please step forward.

44:13.351 --> 44:14.418
DeJa Skye.

44:15.686 --> 44:17.421
Willow Pill.

44:17.421 --> 44:19.390
Bosco.

44:19.390 --> 44:20.958
Jorgeous.

44:20.958 --> 44:22.693
Jasmine Kennedie.

44:23.895 --> 44:27.164
Daya Betty.

44:27.164 --> 44:31.135
Ladies, you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

44:32.837 --> 44:36.107
Lady Camden, Angeria,

44:36.107 --> 44:37.742
you are safe.

44:37.742 --> 44:40.711
You may leave the stage.

44:45.850 --> 44:47.752
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

44:49.453 --> 44:51.856
Up first, DeJa Skye.

44:51.856 --> 44:54.692
DeJa! You comin' for
Whoopi's gig at The View?

44:54.692 --> 44:56.060
[all laugh]

44:56.060 --> 44:58.229
Because you kept it moving,
but also it was funny.

44:58.229 --> 45:00.665
Also, it was, like,
educational and heartfelt.

45:00.665 --> 45:04.268
I was, like, tee hee hee.
Ooh, wow, you know?

45:04.268 --> 45:06.037
I think you did a really
good job at keeping it moving.

45:06.037 --> 45:08.773
There were moments that you felt
a little stiff to me,

45:08.773 --> 45:11.742
but when you gave into it,
it was great.

45:11.742 --> 45:13.878
Keep loosening up.
Keep giving in to it.

45:13.878 --> 45:15.680
Carson, did Michelle say,

45:15.680 --> 45:17.982
"Keep loosening up,
keep giving in to it?"

45:17.982 --> 45:19.383
Yes, yes.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.652
It's, like, I feel like
I say that a lot.

45:21.652 --> 45:22.987
Where'd my stool go?

45:22.987 --> 45:26.223
[all laugh]

45:26.223 --> 45:28.659
This look is what I live for,

45:28.659 --> 45:30.795
because this to me
is like high drag,

45:30.795 --> 45:32.330
because you're giving us camp,

45:32.330 --> 45:34.398
you're giving us
a sense of humor.

45:34.398 --> 45:35.700
You have
the ridiculous shoulders,

45:35.700 --> 45:38.736
and that was the whole thrust
of the challenge.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.137
We look for the ridiculous.

45:40.137 --> 45:44.208
That extra wink, that's
what turns me on personally.

45:44.208 --> 45:47.578
When we had
a shoulder pad storyline,

45:47.578 --> 45:48.980
this is what I expected.

45:48.980 --> 45:50.114
Thank you.

45:50.114 --> 45:52.316
Up next, Willow Pill.

45:52.316 --> 45:53.651
With something like
shoulder pads,

45:53.651 --> 45:56.754
that's Mama Ru saying,
"Do it big."

45:56.754 --> 45:59.824
So I feel like you could have
gone bigger with this look.

45:59.824 --> 46:02.460
It's gorgeous, I love
the construction of it.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.962
Of course, I love
the crystal pinstripe.

46:04.962 --> 46:06.831
I just want
more shoulder pad, too.

46:06.831 --> 46:09.734
And then during the panel,
you know how to tell a joke.

46:09.734 --> 46:11.535
I give really bad handjobs.

46:11.535 --> 46:13.237
Like, you know a setup
and you know a punch,

46:13.237 --> 46:15.239
and, like, you were honest.

46:15.239 --> 46:17.008
-Thank you.
-You were just so relatable.

46:17.008 --> 46:19.744
You still allowed natural room
to laugh and joke about it

46:19.744 --> 46:22.413
and not take your situation
too seriously.

46:22.413 --> 46:24.081
And I learned
so much more about you,

46:24.081 --> 46:26.283
which is what
we wanted to happen.

46:26.283 --> 46:29.120
So on-point with
your outlook on life.

46:29.120 --> 46:32.556
Some people get stuck
in the darkness of it,

46:32.556 --> 46:35.259
but you have clearly
transcended it,

46:35.259 --> 46:37.828
and that's when
it becomes a blast.

46:37.828 --> 46:39.597
It is a blast.

46:39.597 --> 46:44.969
You get more and more fierce
every time you come out here.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.103
Just fabulous.

46:46.103 --> 46:47.304
Thank you.

46:47.304 --> 46:49.807
Up next, Bosco.

46:49.807 --> 46:52.176
Tonight on the runway,
this is a bit simple for me.

46:52.176 --> 46:54.145
-Okay.
-It's a bra with a corset,

46:54.145 --> 46:55.346
panties, and a raincoat.

46:55.346 --> 46:56.847
I kind of like
that bronze bustier,

46:56.847 --> 46:57.882
I like the eyewear.

46:57.882 --> 46:59.950
It's fun.
It's very Dale Bozzio.

46:59.950 --> 47:01.252
Do you know Dale Bozzio?

47:01.252 --> 47:03.954
She was the lead singer
of Missing Persons.

47:03.954 --> 47:05.890
That's who
you look like tonight.

47:05.890 --> 47:07.324
Is she pretty?

47:07.324 --> 47:08.759
-Oh, she's gorgeous.
-Okay, good.

47:08.759 --> 47:10.728
-Yeah. [laughs]
-Love that, then.

47:10.728 --> 47:13.531
And then during the panel,
I thought you were really funny.

47:13.531 --> 47:16.400
Menzeseses.
I believe that's plural.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.835
It didn't feel rehearsed,
it felt like

47:17.835 --> 47:19.403
you were super present,
and I love that.

47:19.403 --> 47:21.605
I think you were
fucking hilarious.

47:21.605 --> 47:24.875
I thought you were a superstar,
a stand-out in the group.

47:24.875 --> 47:28.379
Every good talk show host needs
to be an exquisite listener.

47:28.379 --> 47:29.847
You were in it,
you were living it,

47:29.847 --> 47:32.583
so you were able to listen,
and then you were able to react,

47:32.583 --> 47:35.319
and that's why your comedy
was so natural.

47:35.319 --> 47:38.889
You were born to do
moderating and hosting.

47:38.889 --> 47:40.224
You're very funny.

47:40.224 --> 47:41.826
You had me
at Electric Boogaloo.

47:41.826 --> 47:43.594
[all laugh]

47:43.594 --> 47:46.697
It's all about the breakdancing
craze of the early '80s.

47:46.697 --> 47:50.367
You know, for us
sen...sen...sen...uh...

47:50.367 --> 47:51.769
we love those kind
of references.

47:51.769 --> 47:53.204
Werk.

47:53.204 --> 47:54.305
Thank you very much.

47:54.305 --> 47:55.539
Thank you.

47:55.539 --> 47:56.974
Up next, Jorgeous.

47:56.974 --> 47:59.410
Hello-teous!

47:59.410 --> 48:01.011
This is a really gorgeous
silhouette.

48:01.011 --> 48:03.447
I love that it's a jumpsuit,
I love the materials.

48:03.447 --> 48:06.350
I mean, this material
just catches the light.

48:06.350 --> 48:08.853
But I don't really get
shoulder pads from it.

48:08.853 --> 48:10.054
I get puffy shoulders.

48:10.054 --> 48:12.623
And then in your panel,

48:12.623 --> 48:14.792
for me, I think you receded
a little bit.

48:14.792 --> 48:17.628
Knew about toxic masculini--
toxic masculinity.

48:17.628 --> 48:19.930
And I felt like
you were self-conscious,

48:19.930 --> 48:21.332
and you'd stumble over yourself,

48:21.332 --> 48:23.134
and then you'd get mad
at yourself, and I'd see you.

48:23.134 --> 48:25.469
It's a panel, so you could
just be, like, oh, my God,

48:25.469 --> 48:29.006
speaking's hard today, and then,
like, just reset and start over.

48:29.006 --> 48:30.007
Okay.
[all laugh]

48:30.007 --> 48:31.609
Look, they all laughed.

48:31.609 --> 48:33.110
Easy laugh.

48:33.110 --> 48:34.545
Listen, early on,
I would stumble over my words.

48:34.545 --> 48:36.013
Now, I don't gi--
I don't care.

48:36.013 --> 48:38.816
You know what?
I don't care!

48:38.816 --> 48:40.351
[all laugh]

48:40.351 --> 48:42.987
And you get to an age where
you just don't care, Jorgeous!

48:44.188 --> 48:46.624
That's one of those things
that comes with time.

48:46.624 --> 48:48.826
It was just
a lot of pressure today.

48:48.826 --> 48:51.028
That thing that you do
on the runway,

48:51.028 --> 48:53.998
when you learn how
to apply that to everything,

48:53.998 --> 48:57.268
you will rule the world.

48:58.836 --> 49:01.839
Up next, Jasmine Kennedie.

49:01.839 --> 49:03.607
I love this look on you.

49:03.607 --> 49:06.110
-This is really well edited.
-Yay!

49:06.110 --> 49:08.712
It's sleek, it's a great color
for on the stage.

49:08.712 --> 49:11.115
And I love the shoulder pads.
What a dream. I love it.

49:11.115 --> 49:14.385
In the panel, I did think
you were very charismatic,

49:14.385 --> 49:16.821
but I just didn't
get enough of you.

49:16.821 --> 49:18.689
Now, I know you're a Kennedie,

49:18.689 --> 49:19.990
but in your panel,
you were giving me

49:19.990 --> 49:22.593
Nancy Reagan
as a magician vibes.

49:22.593 --> 49:24.195
There you go!
[all laugh]

49:24.195 --> 49:27.464
Weirdly, you aged yourself
by at least 20 years.

49:27.464 --> 49:29.834
You're so young and sassy,
and that's what I want.

49:29.834 --> 49:31.535
You're 22, damn it.

49:31.535 --> 49:33.804
I want that playfulness.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.540
I do feel like
you did recede a little bit.

49:36.540 --> 49:38.275
Gaming all night,
I just, like, I don't know.

49:38.275 --> 49:40.578
I think
it's a confidence thing.

49:40.578 --> 49:41.645
You can have a couple zingers

49:41.645 --> 49:42.813
and be the star
of the interview.

49:42.813 --> 49:45.149
And I think
it's just exhale, relax,

49:45.149 --> 49:47.117
and just actually
have a conversation.

49:47.117 --> 49:48.953
It's like when
you're talking to friends.

49:48.953 --> 49:52.389
You're not sitting, judging
yourself before you say it,

49:52.389 --> 49:54.191
because that's usually what
happens when you're that young.

49:54.191 --> 49:57.428
You're thinking, well, I've got
to behave a certain type of way.

49:57.428 --> 49:59.997
It's like, no,
don't do that, do you.

50:01.165 --> 50:03.968
Up next, Daya Betty.

50:03.968 --> 50:05.736
Let's talk about
your panel performance.

50:05.736 --> 50:08.405
I thought you were
very personable,

50:08.405 --> 50:10.674
very relatable,
very articulate.

50:10.674 --> 50:13.043
Someone with nipples,
like Carson Kressley.

50:13.043 --> 50:14.912
I also really loved your outfit.

50:14.912 --> 50:17.248
You truly were, like, drag!
And everyone else was, like,

50:17.248 --> 50:19.750
I'm a nice woman,
it's a nice day.

50:19.750 --> 50:20.918
I really enjoyed
the conversation

50:20.918 --> 50:22.119
about the WWE stuff...

50:22.119 --> 50:24.521
-[laughs]
-Ooh.

50:24.521 --> 50:26.590
Because wrestlers
are drag queens.

50:26.590 --> 50:27.691
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

50:27.691 --> 50:28.759
I mean, think about
The Undertaker

50:28.759 --> 50:29.827
and think about Ric Flair.

50:29.827 --> 50:30.995
They were full drag.

50:30.995 --> 50:32.630
WWE was, like,
a thing

50:32.630 --> 50:34.198
that I watched with my dad,

50:34.198 --> 50:36.834
and so I feel like that
does kind of come into play

50:36.834 --> 50:38.636
-with my drag a little bit.
-Sure.

50:38.636 --> 50:40.738
It's a very special place
in my heart.

50:40.738 --> 50:43.073
It holds a very
special place in my heart.

50:43.073 --> 50:45.976
Yeah, I usually watch it
with a fistful of lotion.

50:45.976 --> 50:47.011
[all laugh]

50:47.011 --> 50:48.112
You, too? Okay.

50:48.112 --> 50:50.814
[all laugh]

50:50.814 --> 50:53.250
Thank you, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

50:53.250 --> 50:55.753
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

50:55.753 --> 50:57.988
the judges and I
will deliberate.

50:59.290 --> 51:01.458
Now, just between
us squirrel friends,

51:01.458 --> 51:03.594
I wanna know
what you think.

51:03.594 --> 51:05.129
DeJa Skye.

51:05.129 --> 51:08.165
I thought she was so wonderful
as the moderator.

51:08.165 --> 51:11.936
She was so good at keeping
the conversation flowing

51:11.936 --> 51:14.004
-and not letting it lull.
-She was fantastic tonight.

51:14.004 --> 51:15.539
And I thought
she looked beautiful

51:15.539 --> 51:16.707
during the panel.

51:16.707 --> 51:18.709
Honestly,
I wanna see more.

51:18.709 --> 51:19.843
Willow Pill.

51:19.843 --> 51:21.578
She looked really sweet
and demure,

51:21.578 --> 51:23.080
and she was cutting bitches
left and right.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.082
Her jokes are hilarious,

51:25.082 --> 51:26.951
and she knows
where to insert them.

51:26.951 --> 51:30.754
I love that she gives us wildly
different looks every time.

51:30.754 --> 51:34.191
She definitely has a style,
but it's never the same look.

51:34.191 --> 51:36.126
I do wish there was,
you know, more shoulder pad,

51:36.126 --> 51:38.462
but I don't care, I like her.

51:38.462 --> 51:40.764
-Bosco.
-She is so witty.

51:40.764 --> 51:43.767
If DeJa Skye was, like,
commercial moderating,

51:43.767 --> 51:48.439
Bosco is, like, ooh, nightclub,
edgy moderating if you will.

51:48.439 --> 51:49.907
Why?

51:49.907 --> 51:51.508
She was very funny, very dry.

51:51.508 --> 51:54.144
Bosco was fantastic.

51:54.144 --> 51:56.280
I just laughed
from the very beginning.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.416
Clearly the stand-out
from her group.

51:59.416 --> 52:00.918
Jorgeous.

52:00.918 --> 52:03.320
Our little Jorgeous
got sucked up

52:03.320 --> 52:05.622
in that panel,
and we lost her.

52:05.622 --> 52:08.993
She needs to learn how to lay
into those flaws and use them,

52:08.993 --> 52:11.095
like a Chrissy Snow
or a Goldie Hawn would,

52:11.095 --> 52:13.130
to build a character.

52:13.130 --> 52:16.133
The panel look, the hairline
for me was very distracting.

52:16.133 --> 52:17.634
There was a lot of makeup
at the hairline.

52:17.634 --> 52:18.802
Not good.

52:18.802 --> 52:21.405
Tonight, not a good night
for Jorgeous.

52:21.405 --> 52:22.806
Jasmine Kennedie.

52:22.806 --> 52:24.508
On the panel,
I don't understand

52:24.508 --> 52:26.977
why she looked 45
instead of 22.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.346
A bit magician-y with the cape.

52:29.346 --> 52:30.981
[imitates Margaret Thatcher]
It was like the Iron Lady

52:30.981 --> 52:34.018
-does a bit of magic.
-Yes. Yes, exactly.

52:34.018 --> 52:36.387
[imitates Margaret Thatcher]
The pearls are non-negotiable.

52:36.387 --> 52:38.022
[all laugh]

52:38.022 --> 52:41.692
I think she is so fun
and so endearing,

52:41.692 --> 52:44.395
but tonight she felt
a little stiff.

52:44.395 --> 52:48.298
She's not quite as confident
in who she is as a presenter.

52:48.298 --> 52:50.667
-Daya Betty.
-On the panel,

52:50.667 --> 52:53.270
I thought she was
really endearing, really sweet.

52:53.270 --> 52:55.906
Wasn't the best,
but it was interesting.

52:55.906 --> 52:59.610
On the runway, yes,
she did paint her face

52:59.610 --> 53:01.378
house-down combat boots.

53:01.378 --> 53:02.913
[all laugh]

53:02.913 --> 53:06.250
But the look for me
was just so columnar.

53:06.250 --> 53:08.952
Is that a word, when you look
like just a column?

53:08.952 --> 53:10.821
Oh, cylindrical?

53:10.821 --> 53:12.189
-Sure, we'll go with that.
-Okay.

53:12.189 --> 53:14.024
Silence!

53:14.024 --> 53:16.160
I've made my decision.

53:16.160 --> 53:17.327
Bring back my girls.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.397
Welcome back, ladies.

53:20.397 --> 53:21.765
I've made some decisions.

53:24.234 --> 53:29.573
Bosco. Your electric boogaloo
was breakin' new ground.

53:29.573 --> 53:32.943
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

53:32.943 --> 53:35.446
[cheers and applause]

53:35.446 --> 53:39.917
You've won a cash prize
of $5.000

53:39.917 --> 53:42.252
-courtesy of Snag Tights.
-Thank you so much.

53:42.252 --> 53:44.788
When RuPaul tells you
"con-drag-ulations,"

53:44.788 --> 53:48.425
alls I feel
is just pure elation.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.030
Willow Pill. This week,

53:53.030 --> 53:56.333
the judges wanna give you
a hand... Job well done.

53:56.333 --> 53:58.068
[all laugh]

53:58.068 --> 53:59.937
-You're safe.
-Thank you.

53:59.937 --> 54:03.273
Yes, Willow!
[applause]

54:03.273 --> 54:07.678
DeJa Skye. We were cuckoo
for your Coco.

54:07.678 --> 54:12.616
Now, take a little time
to enjoy the DeJa view.

54:13.717 --> 54:16.253
-You are safe.
-Thank you.

54:16.253 --> 54:19.323
[applause]

54:20.691 --> 54:24.061
Jorgeous. You were glittering
on the runway,

54:24.061 --> 54:27.264
but we missed that Jorgeous
sparkle in the challenge.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.534
Jasmine Kennedie.

54:30.534 --> 54:33.837
On the runway, you made
a bold fashion statement,

54:33.837 --> 54:35.572
but in the panel...

54:35.572 --> 54:37.307
[voice fades away]
you faded into the background.

Daya Betty, in the challenge,
you were stone-cold stunning,

54:46.683 --> 54:48.519
but your runway look

54:48.519 --> 54:50.521
needs to sign up
for booty camp.

54:56.393 --> 54:58.996
Daya Betty, you are safe.

55:02.866 --> 55:04.835
Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.

Jorgeous, Jasmine,
I'm sorry, my dears,

55:13.644 --> 55:16.613

is mine to make.

55:38.902 --> 55:44.274
