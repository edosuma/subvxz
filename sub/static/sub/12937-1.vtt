WEBVTT

00:19.945 --> 00:21.572
New York City.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.905
He wants to see what's there.

00:23.907 --> 00:25.705
I can tell him what's there.

00:25.826 --> 00:29.251
I don't know how,
when you've never been.

01:22.925 --> 01:27.601
Well, Toto, I guess
we're not in Kansas any more.

01:29.473 --> 01:33.353
I can't figure out why he'd want to go
to New York when we got everything here.

01:34.478 --> 01:36.572
Somethin' I have to do, Dad.

01:36.647 --> 01:39.241
Did you pack an iron
like I told you to?

01:39.316 --> 01:40.442
Mom.

01:40.526 --> 01:43.700
You're gonna walk around
wrinkled in New York if you don't.

01:43.779 --> 01:47.534
Elmer Whitfield's cousin Carlton
went off to New York a normal boy.

01:47.616 --> 01:51.211
Came back with his head shaved
and an earring stuck in his cheek.

02:30.325 --> 02:32.293
Mom, there's
a whole world out there.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.918
I mean big, exciting.

02:35.038 --> 02:37.336
I got a nice,
small apartment lined up.

02:37.416 --> 02:39.669
I got a great job.

02:39.751 --> 02:42.095
I wanna make lots of money.

02:42.212 --> 02:46.217
I want to have a meaningful experience
with an incredibly beautiful woman.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.432
I can't even take a woman like that
to a small apartment.

02:49.511 --> 02:52.014
- I gotta get a penthouse.
- A penthouse?

02:52.139 --> 02:54.062
With a Jacuzzi in it.

02:55.559 --> 02:58.062
Doin' this for you
as much as for me, Mom.

02:58.770 --> 03:02.195
All those years of college...
They're gonna start payin' off.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.835
Back!

04:19.351 --> 04:21.024
All right, listen up.

04:21.103 --> 04:24.448
If there are any bugs in here or rats or
anything that has more legs than I do...

04:24.523 --> 04:27.402
you just stay on your side
of the room, okay?

04:27.484 --> 04:29.486
I'll stay on mine.

04:30.320 --> 04:33.324
I should warn you.
I'm packing an iron.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.211
You weren't listening.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.309
Darling, please pack it
as fast as you can.

05:00.392 --> 05:02.850
- Mr Forbush?
- Not me! He's two doors down the hall.

05:02.853 --> 05:05.072
Into the shredder
as fast as possible.

05:09.026 --> 05:11.279
- Mr Forbush.
- Yep.

05:11.361 --> 05:14.285
Hi, I'm Brantley Foster
from Kansas.

05:14.364 --> 05:17.413
- You hired me. I start work here today.
- You're fired, kid. Sorry.

05:17.492 --> 05:20.086
We all saw it coming, but we
looked for some kind of miracle.

05:20.162 --> 05:21.755
Miracle never happened.

05:21.913 --> 05:23.790
- What did happen?
- Hostile takeover.

05:23.874 --> 05:26.718
Ninety percent of the people
in this building are out on the street.

05:26.793 --> 05:30.388
You are one of those 90%.
Tough break.

05:31.632 --> 05:35.557
Mr Forbush, I was counting on this job.
What do I do now?

05:36.053 --> 05:37.896
Punt!

05:43.518 --> 05:45.316
Okay, New York...

05:45.395 --> 05:47.944
if this is the way
you want it, okay.

05:49.775 --> 05:52.278
- I'm sorry, Mister...
- Foster.

05:52.444 --> 05:55.414
I'm sorry, Mr Foster.
We need someone with experience.

05:55.489 --> 05:59.744
But how can I get experience until
I get a job that gives me experience?

05:59.826 --> 06:01.994
If we gave you a job
just to give you experience...

06:01.995 --> 06:04.748
you'd take that experience
and get a better job.

06:04.873 --> 06:07.163
Then that experience
would benefit someone else.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.171
But I was trained in college
to handle a job like this.

06:10.253 --> 06:13.348
So in a sense,
I already have experience.

06:13.423 --> 06:15.300
What you've got is
college experience...

06:15.384 --> 06:18.854
not the practical, hard-nosed business
experience we're looking for.

06:18.929 --> 06:22.274
If you'd joined our training program out
of high school, you'd be qualified now.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.192
Then why did I go to college?

06:24.309 --> 06:26.277
Had fun, didn't you?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.366
What impresses me most...

06:31.441 --> 06:35.116
is the amount of experience you picked
up while still attending college.

06:35.278 --> 06:38.248
Well, ma'am, I knew all
those years of college...

06:38.323 --> 06:41.918
would be worthless without practical,
hard-nosed business experience.

06:41.993 --> 06:45.213
"Assistant personnel manager,
J. Hall Communications.

06:45.288 --> 06:48.462
Junior purchasing agent,
Midland Furniture.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.591
Vice President in Charge of
Production, Central Manufacturing."

06:51.670 --> 06:54.048
Outstanding.

06:56.299 --> 06:59.223
You're not gonna tell me I have
too much experience, are you?

06:59.302 --> 07:01.725
Certainly not.
You're perfect for the job.

07:01.805 --> 07:03.352
- Great!
- Except...

07:03.432 --> 07:05.776
No.
No exceptions.

07:05.851 --> 07:08.183
I want this job.
I need it. I can do it.

07:08.186 --> 07:10.405
Everywhere I've been today
there's been something wrong.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.778
Too young, too old,
too short, too tall.

07:12.941 --> 07:14.943
Whatever the exception is,
I can fix it.

07:15.026 --> 07:17.529
I can be older. I can be taller.
I can be anything.

07:17.612 --> 07:19.706
Can you be a minority woman?

07:22.284 --> 07:25.754
- Mom, I'm doin' great.
- Is it dirty? Are the people rude?

07:25.829 --> 07:28.503
No, this town is terrific.
The people are really nice.

07:28.582 --> 07:32.086
<i>- That's good. What about your job?</i>
- Job? Hey!

07:32.252 --> 07:35.756
I got a fantastic office,
got a gorgeous secretary. The works.

07:35.839 --> 07:38.513
<i>We don't care if she's gorgeous.
Is she any good?</i>

07:38.633 --> 07:41.477
- What?
- <i>You heard me. Can she type?</i>

07:41.553 --> 07:43.351
Ma, of course she can type.

07:43.430 --> 07:47.105
<i>Some can't, you know. Is it safe there?
You haven't been robbed?</i>

07:47.184 --> 07:50.279
Ma, will you quit worryin'?
There is no danger.

07:50.353 --> 07:54.449
- <i>But New York is...</i>
- New York is like Kansas intensified.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.574
- What?
- <i>What's that? Something the matter?</i>

07:58.653 --> 08:01.122
No, Mom.
That's just the TV.

08:01.198 --> 08:03.576
<i>- It sounds so real.</i>
- It's Miami Vice.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.873
<i>Can you turn the sound down?
It's too loud.</i>

08:05.952 --> 08:09.081
Ma, it's broken.
The knob came off in my hand.

08:09.164 --> 08:13.449
<i>Goodness. Well, what about
Uncle Howard? Did you call him?</i>

08:13.460 --> 08:16.054
Uncle Howard!
Yeah, the phone number.

08:16.171 --> 08:18.506
<i>Well, you still have
the number, don't you?</i>

08:18.507 --> 08:21.852
Oh, yeah.
I got it right here.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.312
<i>Are you all right?
You seem distracted.</i>

08:24.387 --> 08:26.389
They just totalled a Ferrari.

08:26.473 --> 08:29.226
<i>But Uncle Howard...
did you call him?</i>

08:29.309 --> 08:31.812
No, I haven't had a chance
to call Uncle Howard yet.

08:31.895 --> 08:33.647
<i>Will you try to see him?</i>

08:33.730 --> 08:35.573
I'll probably bump into him
at the country club.

08:36.232 --> 08:38.155
<i>Get the TV fixed, dear.</i>

08:38.235 --> 08:39.861
Yeah.

08:39.945 --> 08:43.370
- Listen, I gotta go. Okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

08:43.532 --> 08:46.206
- Give Dad my love.
<i>- I will, dear. I love you, Brantley.</i>

08:46.284 --> 08:50.130
- I love you too, Mom. Bye-bye.
- Bye!

09:32.706 --> 09:36.336
Well, at least let me
buy you an airline ticket.

09:36.501 --> 09:38.503
Dad, I'm gonna do this
on my own.

09:38.587 --> 09:41.340
But you did make it
a round-trip ticket?

09:41.423 --> 09:43.972
Yeah. I'm not
gonna need it.

09:44.843 --> 09:48.268
No, when I come back to Kansas,
I'm comin' back in my own jet.

10:06.907 --> 10:10.411
Take this. It's Uncle Howard's
phone number in New York.

10:10.493 --> 10:12.291
I got an uncle in New York?

10:12.412 --> 10:15.256
My cousin Ellen married
his half sister's nephew...

10:15.332 --> 10:18.176
before she got bit
by that dog and died.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.629
But he's still kin,
and kin is kin.

11:24.609 --> 11:25.986
Hi.

11:27.278 --> 11:29.531
I'd like to see
Mr Prescott, please.

11:29.614 --> 11:31.948
Do you have an appointment?

11:31.950 --> 11:34.999
I tried to get one, but I couldn't,
so I just thought I'd surprise him.

11:35.078 --> 11:37.456
Mr Prescott
doesn't like surprises.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.709
- Everybody likes surprises.
- Not Mr Prescott.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.713
- You can leave your name.
- Brantley Foster.

11:44.796 --> 11:48.221
- Of?
- Of Kansas.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.268
Of what company?

11:52.429 --> 11:54.898
What do you wanna see
Mr Prescott about?

11:58.059 --> 12:00.349
About being his nephew.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.106
Well, why don't you
have a seat?

12:03.231 --> 12:05.700
I'll see if I can work you
into Mr Prescott's schedule.

12:05.775 --> 12:07.197
Thank you.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.141
Give Uncle Howard my card.

12:41.811 --> 12:44.064
Are you really
Mr Prescott's nephew?

12:46.024 --> 12:48.026
In a roundabout sort of way.

12:48.109 --> 12:51.534
You sons of bitches don't
have a half a brain between you!

12:51.613 --> 12:54.867
I'm looking at
a $300 million deficit here...

12:54.949 --> 12:58.419
because you idiots didn't anticipate
the needs of a changing market!

12:58.495 --> 13:01.248
- Uncle Howard?
- Now, get out, all of you!

13:01.372 --> 13:03.662
And bring me back some
new ideas that'll work!

13:03.666 --> 13:07.261
Or I'll have your heads
mounted on my wall!

13:07.378 --> 13:10.177
- Geez, he's gonna burst a blood vessel.
- Yeah, wishful thinking.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.631
I'll see if I can
get you in now.

13:13.635 --> 13:15.012
Thank you.

13:16.137 --> 13:18.640
You know, it can't be good
for his heart to shout that way.

13:18.723 --> 13:20.725
He doesn't have a heart.

13:21.935 --> 13:25.064
- What, Maureen, what?
- Brantley Foster is here to see you.

13:25.146 --> 13:27.194
I don't know any Brantley Foster.

13:27.273 --> 13:30.025
- Your nephew from Kansas.
- Who?

13:30.026 --> 13:33.656
- He says he's your nephew from Kansas.
- Kansas?

13:40.370 --> 13:42.543
Mr Prescott will see you now.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.717
Clever.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.640
So you're one
of the Kansas Fosters, huh?

13:52.715 --> 13:55.218
Shirttail relative,
to say the least.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.182
Listen...

13:57.303 --> 14:00.807
I know you probably told your secretary
to get me outta here in five minutes.

14:00.890 --> 14:02.767
- Two.
- Right.

14:02.851 --> 14:06.947
So I'll get right to the point.

14:07.480 --> 14:11.235
- I need a job, Uncle Howard.
- Around here, I'm Mr Prescott.

14:11.901 --> 14:13.949
Do you have any idea
what we do here?

14:14.028 --> 14:15.450
Yes, sir.

14:15.530 --> 14:18.905
Pemrose is a multinational conglomerate
with 27 different divisions.

14:18.908 --> 14:22.037
Products ranging from dog food
to guided missile systems.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.124
There are 30,000 people
working in this building alone.

14:25.206 --> 14:28.176
Their accumulated salary is higher
than the gross national product...

14:28.251 --> 14:31.050
of half the nations
in the Common Market.

14:31.129 --> 14:36.010
Last year we borrowed more money
from banks than Mexico did.

14:36.134 --> 14:38.254
It's a great company, Uncle...

14:38.261 --> 14:41.515
Mr Prescott. That's why I'm here.

14:43.266 --> 14:46.987
What can you do for us, Brantley?
What experience have you had?

14:49.189 --> 14:50.907
Practically none.

14:52.317 --> 14:54.411
But I believe in myself.

14:55.820 --> 15:00.451
Doesn't that count? Deep inside, I know
I can do anything if I get a chance.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.293
Think back to when
you were my ahe.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.707
Remember how you felt when
you went after that first job.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.710
Remember how
you wanted it so badly...

15:10.793 --> 15:12.795
you couldn't sleep
the night before the interview.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.052
Remember how crushed you were
when the guy said...

15:15.131 --> 15:17.133
"What kind
of experience have you got?"

15:18.218 --> 15:21.222
You wanted to shake
your fists and say...

15:21.304 --> 15:24.854
"I can do anything
if I can just get a chance."

15:26.017 --> 15:28.611
They're ready for you
in the boardroom, Mr Prescott.

15:32.482 --> 15:35.406
Call Bates in Personnel.
Tell him I'm sending somebody up.

15:36.986 --> 15:38.954
Well, you're
in the front door, kid.

15:39.030 --> 15:41.658
What you do on this side of it
is up to you.

15:45.370 --> 15:49.580
Congratulations. He really
must have taken a shine to you.

15:49.582 --> 15:53.212
Thanks.
He's a warm guy.

16:01.844 --> 16:03.096
May I?

17:48.576 --> 17:51.375
You can't come in here, bozo.
Take your crap to the mail slot.

17:51.496 --> 17:53.294
I work here.
Just started.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.217
What do you want, an engraved
invitation? Come on. Come on.

18:00.254 --> 18:02.803
Brantley, eh?
Somebody gave you that name?

18:04.425 --> 18:07.770
Jesus, a college puke!
This really makes my day.

18:07.845 --> 18:10.143
- Well, you're welcome.
- Melrose, get over here!

18:16.229 --> 18:18.607
Listen to what he says,
then do what he does.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.450
Stay out of my way. Don't use
the stamp machine for personal letters.

18:21.526 --> 18:24.871
Take off that stupid-looking tie.
Looks like you shot your couch.

18:24.946 --> 18:27.324
- You got any questions?
- Yeah. What do I call you?

18:27.407 --> 18:30.160
- Call me God.
- Got a problem, Boss? I'm your man.

18:30.284 --> 18:33.037
Show the college puke the ropes
and keep him outta my face.

18:33.121 --> 18:35.544
His name is Brantley.

18:35.623 --> 18:38.001
All right, kid.
Follow me.

18:39.127 --> 18:42.381
<i>All right, you stick with me
and everything's gonna be copacetic.</i>

18:42.463 --> 18:45.840
<i>Twice a day you deliver. Like a mailman,
you pick up whatever's goin 'out.</i>

18:45.841 --> 18:49.016
<i>I can do it in 30 minutes. Rattigan
thinks it takes me two hours.</i>

18:49.095 --> 18:51.268
What's this department?
What do they do here?

18:51.347 --> 18:55.352
Who knows? This place is a zoo.
Nobody knows what anybody else is doin'.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.483
Can you get promoted
out of the mailroom?

18:57.562 --> 19:01.738
You can't even get paroled out of
the mailroom. Excuse me, dear.

19:03.067 --> 19:04.865
Good morning.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.447
- Nix.
- What?

19:07.572 --> 19:10.416
- Good morning.
- Look, not the suits.

19:10.491 --> 19:12.960
- What do you mean?
- Excuse me, sir.

19:13.077 --> 19:15.492
- Good morning.
- Look, not the suits, man.

19:15.496 --> 19:18.966
You never consort with the suits,
unless they consort with you first.

19:19.709 --> 19:23.054
That's ridiculous. He's a person.
I'm a person. I can't say hello?

19:23.129 --> 19:24.881
He's not a person.
He's a suit.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.968
You're mailroom.
No consorting. Come on.

19:30.261 --> 19:32.013
We're entering
a sensitive zone.

19:32.096 --> 19:34.190
This guy in that office
just got canned.

19:34.265 --> 19:36.859
Mailroom knew about it on Friday.
He just found out today.

19:36.934 --> 19:40.029
No kidding.
Is his job still open?

19:40.104 --> 19:42.653
No, man, an economic cutback.
His job was dissolved.

19:42.732 --> 19:45.281
About two dozen
suits got the ax.

19:48.362 --> 19:51.161
Will you quit trying to consort?
Come on.

19:56.037 --> 19:58.165
<i>All right, the yellow ones
go to purchasing.</i>

19:58.247 --> 20:00.750
<i>All the white ones are a bunch
of suits talkin 'to themselves.</i>

20:08.633 --> 20:11.227
You're supposed to
deliver 'em, not read 'em.

20:11.302 --> 20:13.521
Some of this stuff
doesn't make any sense.

20:13.596 --> 20:15.564
They send requisitions
through two departments...

20:15.640 --> 20:17.313
to get procurements
for a third.

20:17.391 --> 20:19.769
- What kind of thinking is that?
- That's suit thinking.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.355
Something happens to a man
when he puts on a necktie.

20:22.438 --> 20:24.315
Cuts off all the oxygen
to his brain.

20:26.943 --> 20:30.573
You crazy? You're not supposed to
take the memos out of the mailroom.

20:30.655 --> 20:33.579
I can't follow a chain of
command in this company.

20:33.658 --> 20:37.003
They got the right title, but their job
assignments and objectives are screwed...

20:37.078 --> 20:39.547
- Look at this. Jesus. Purchasing.
- What?

20:39.664 --> 20:42.133
It's a joke. They've got two people
doin' basically the same job.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.051
Neither one of them
is doin' it right.

20:44.126 --> 20:46.128
I'll bring it up at the next
stockholders meeting.

20:46.212 --> 20:49.432
- Would you put these things away?
- Whoa, Melrose.

20:50.091 --> 20:53.436
How ya doin'? We've been gettin'
a lot of requests in the mailroom...

20:53.511 --> 20:56.811
for stockholder information,
company assets, expenditures.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.517
- Anything you can give us.
- You're kidding?

20:59.600 --> 21:02.149
Any of this research
you want, you can have.

21:02.937 --> 21:05.611
- Take it all.
- Thanks very much.

22:24.268 --> 22:27.067
She's the most incredible-looking woman
I've ever seen in my life.

22:27.647 --> 22:31.447
She's a Rolls-Royce,
but she's also a suit.

22:32.735 --> 22:35.534
What's she like?
What do you know about her?

22:35.655 --> 22:37.988
I know enough never
to consort with the suits, pal.

22:37.989 --> 22:41.711
- Even when they do have legs like hers.
- Come on. You know more than that.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.625
Her name is Christy Wills.

22:43.704 --> 22:46.082
She's supposed to be some
sort of financial wizard, you know?

22:46.165 --> 22:47.838
Harvard.
All that crap.

22:51.128 --> 22:53.051
And forget it.

23:10.564 --> 23:13.317
No.
That's Transportation's problem.

23:13.401 --> 23:15.699
No, we do not supply drivers
for executives' wives.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.868
We are a messenger service.

23:17.947 --> 23:20.917
I don't care if the other
drivers are all busy.

23:22.451 --> 23:24.829
Yeah, well, the same
to you, sweetheart.

23:25.496 --> 23:27.874
Hey, Dartmouth, get over here.

23:27.957 --> 23:30.210
Executive's wife wants
a ride up to Litchfield.

23:30.292 --> 23:33.592
- Check out a car and drive her.
- Where's Litchfield?

23:33.671 --> 23:36.220
You'll find it. Just follow
the smell of money.

23:46.475 --> 23:48.477
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm not quite sure which way...

23:48.561 --> 23:51.861
Turn the key, start the car,
put it in drive and step on the gas.

23:51.939 --> 23:54.692
Any idiot can do that,
even my husband.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.248
Excuse me, ma'am.

24:01.323 --> 24:03.951
- I know I'm not supposed to consort...
- Then don't.

24:06.203 --> 24:09.673
You seem kind of upset. I was wonderin'
if there was anything I could do.

24:10.541 --> 24:12.635
I don't know.
My cook quit this morning.

24:12.710 --> 24:15.259
My analyst is away on vacation.
My Mercedes broke down.

24:15.379 --> 24:19.100
I split my nail, and my husband
is screwing somebody at the office.

24:19.175 --> 24:21.428
What did you have in mind?

24:22.595 --> 24:24.393
Stick of gum?

24:28.142 --> 24:32.022
This is the third weekend he's found
an excuse not to come to the country.

24:32.605 --> 24:36.985
No, I don't know. But knowing him,
it's probably some teenage airhead...

24:36.986 --> 24:38.736
from the steno pool.

24:39.904 --> 24:42.123
The last one I caught
him with was so dumb...

24:42.124 --> 24:46.210
she thought dictation
was some kind of S and M trip.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.208
Do you know my husband?

24:49.538 --> 24:51.336
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.

24:51.415 --> 24:53.292
Never mind.

24:53.375 --> 24:57.300
- Didn't hear a thing.
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

24:59.590 --> 25:01.718
I'm so mad, I could spit.

25:02.384 --> 25:05.308
He looks twice as good today
as the day we were married.

25:05.429 --> 25:07.431
I just look twice as old.

25:07.890 --> 25:09.483
Are you kiddin'?

25:11.727 --> 25:14.822
I hope that when I'm his age,
I can wake up every morning...

25:14.897 --> 25:18.618
and find a woman as beautiful
as you are lying next to me.

25:20.069 --> 25:21.446
Thank you.

26:55.623 --> 26:57.421
Turn in here.

26:58.375 --> 27:00.218
Please.

28:02.898 --> 28:07.654
- Bring those inside. Charles.
- May I help you with those, sir?

28:07.736 --> 28:09.613
What are you drinking?

28:09.738 --> 28:12.412
I can't really.
I have to get back.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.628
God, I hate the country.

28:17.454 --> 28:20.424
Yeah, I can see
how you'd be real miserable here.

28:21.959 --> 28:24.257
Who can live
with so many trees?

28:24.336 --> 28:26.464
They suck up all the oxygen.

28:27.381 --> 28:29.884
No, actually,
trees produce oxygen.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.011
Who are you?
Mr Wizard?

28:33.137 --> 28:35.435
What did you say your name was?

28:36.098 --> 28:38.692
- Brantley.
- No, I mean your first name.

28:40.269 --> 28:42.397
That's it: Brantley.

28:42.479 --> 28:46.029
Well, Brantley, I don't know what
you want out of Pemrose Corporation...

28:46.191 --> 28:48.193
but I'll tell you
what you do not want.

28:48.610 --> 28:51.614
You don't ever, ever
wanna become a corporate wife.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.784
I'll watch my step.

29:00.914 --> 29:02.757
Have another.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.096
Thanks.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.137
I've run 8,000 miles
on that tennis court...

29:11.216 --> 29:15.062
chasing a fuzzy, little yellow ball
with an oversized racket.

29:15.137 --> 29:16.980
Do my legs look heavy to you?

29:19.349 --> 29:20.350
No.

29:20.434 --> 29:23.813
I've swum laps from here
to the moon in that pool.

29:24.897 --> 29:27.491
Do you see anything
in this body that isn't firm?

29:29.985 --> 29:33.279
Tennis, swimming,
aerobics, jogging, massage...

29:33.280 --> 29:36.284
Anything and everything
to stay in shape.

29:36.366 --> 29:38.368
Not that he'd ever notice.

29:39.536 --> 29:43.382
So, Brantley, do you
know why I stay in shape?

29:49.379 --> 29:52.007
- How 'bout a dip in the pool?
- No, wait!

29:52.091 --> 29:54.594
Are you serious?
Listen...

29:54.676 --> 29:58.772
I have to get back. This is a
tempting diversion, but I got a job.

29:58.847 --> 30:02.522
- I don't know if this is a good idea.
- Transportation, please.

30:02.643 --> 30:05.943
Yes. The young man from the
mailroom who drove me home?

30:05.944 --> 30:10.024
He's going to stay here and do
a little work in my garden.

30:10.025 --> 30:13.245
See that he gets full credit
on his time card.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.867
Thank you.

30:15.572 --> 30:17.995
Help me out of this, will you, dear?

30:34.758 --> 30:38.638
- That was great.
- Thanks. I swim five miles a day.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.599
- Supposed to tone my ass.
- Yeah, it works.

30:44.059 --> 30:46.733
Just when I thought it was safe
to go back in the water.

30:58.740 --> 31:02.335
- You sure this is a good idea?
- It's okay. I know the owner.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.171
Last one out of the...

31:09.960 --> 31:12.588
- Sure your husband's not coming home?
- Who knows?

31:13.046 --> 31:14.889
He could be home any minute...

31:15.632 --> 31:17.680
or several hours from now.

31:21.471 --> 31:23.599
Oh, my God.

31:34.693 --> 31:37.162
I'm gonna see that
my husband gives you a leg up.

31:37.279 --> 31:40.374
I think we've done pretty well
so far by ourselves.

31:43.076 --> 31:45.204
I mean Pemrose.

31:48.916 --> 31:50.168
No.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.211
No, thanks.

31:53.337 --> 31:55.965
No, I'm gonna make it
to the top by myself.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.052
God, you're adorable.

32:03.347 --> 32:07.568
I could spend a week inside
those sweet, unwrinkled eyes.

32:09.311 --> 32:12.815
- Can I make a personal observation?
- Anything but the thighs.

32:12.940 --> 32:17.320
Somebody sold you a bill of goods and
convinced you you had to be 21 forever.

32:18.403 --> 32:21.748
That's bullshit!
I think you're terrific.

32:21.823 --> 32:24.451
The only thing wrong with you
is your husband is a jerk.

32:24.534 --> 32:26.707
You're beautiful.
You're intelligent.

32:26.787 --> 32:29.006
You're sensuous.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.713
Say that again!

32:33.543 --> 32:36.217
- Which part?
- All of it!

32:39.675 --> 32:41.677
Oh, no!

32:42.469 --> 32:45.018
- What? What is it?
- It's the jerk.

32:51.144 --> 32:52.691
My husband.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.739
- My uncle.
- Your what?

32:57.859 --> 33:00.487
- Oh, God! That makes you...
- Auntie Vera?

33:06.868 --> 33:08.962
What's my mother gonna say?

33:09.037 --> 33:11.790
- I've disgraced my whole family.
- The hell you did!

33:12.541 --> 33:15.545
Not funny! Okay?
This is not a funny moment in my life.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.800
Relax.
Who's gonna find out?

33:17.879 --> 33:19.756
I'm home!

33:20.882 --> 33:23.556
He's gonna find out.
That's who's gonna find out.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.683
Don't worry!
He won't fire you.

33:25.762 --> 33:28.436
There's no way I'm gonna
get a raise out of this.

33:28.515 --> 33:31.485
Vera, what's the company car
doing in the driveway?

33:31.560 --> 33:34.814
It broke down, darling. The driver
had to take the train back to town.

33:34.896 --> 33:37.740
No, he didn't, darling. He's in here
having trouble with his fly.

33:37.816 --> 33:40.114
- Get back! Do you ever stop?
- No!

33:40.235 --> 33:42.363
How am I gonna get home?

33:42.446 --> 33:45.245
Maybe we'll just have to keep
you here and adopt you.

33:45.866 --> 33:47.618
You're a riot, Vera.

33:58.128 --> 34:00.130
Please, Lord,
get me out of this.

34:00.213 --> 34:03.433
I'll go all over the world telling
people not to screw the boss's wife.

34:03.508 --> 34:07.809
- What are you doing in here?
- Feeling romantic.

34:07.888 --> 34:10.391
What's for dinner?

34:10.474 --> 34:14.820
Oh, Howard! You really know how
to sweep a girl back onto her feet.

34:21.902 --> 34:23.745
Go back!

34:29.117 --> 34:31.165
Sit! Sit down!

34:37.667 --> 34:40.670
You look like death on a cracker, man.
What happened to you?

34:40.754 --> 34:44.554
I was chased by a 200-pound dog
with a mouth as big as my head.

34:44.632 --> 34:46.975
And that was the best thing
that happened last night.

34:46.976 --> 34:49.516
- What was the worst thing?
- I got laid.

34:49.679 --> 34:51.976
I'm not sure you got
your priorities straight.

34:56.561 --> 34:58.313
Hold the elevator.
Good morning.

34:59.022 --> 35:00.740
Hi.

35:33.265 --> 35:35.108
<i>We're entering a sensitive zone.</i>

35:35.183 --> 35:37.402
<i>The guy in that office
just got canned.</i>

35:37.477 --> 35:40.822
<i>The mailroom knew about it on Friday.
He just found out today.</i>

36:18.894 --> 36:21.522
<i>I'm gonna see
that my husband gives you a leg up.</i>

36:21.605 --> 36:23.699
No, thanks.

36:24.774 --> 36:26.242
No.

36:27.611 --> 36:30.080
No, I'm gonna make it
to the top on my own.

37:20.622 --> 37:23.671
- Hello.
<i>- Tucker, where the hell have you been?</i>

37:23.750 --> 37:25.718
We got a problem
in Midwest Distribution.

37:25.794 --> 37:28.343
What are you gonna do about it?

37:28.505 --> 37:31.008
What's the problem?

37:31.091 --> 37:34.641
Our stock is down
another quarter point this morning.

37:34.761 --> 37:36.604
Whose fault is that, Thomas?

37:36.680 --> 37:39.524
Nobody's fault, sir.
It's a momentary lapse in the market.

37:39.599 --> 37:42.853
- Whose fault is it, Thomas?
- It's Davis's fault, sir.

37:42.936 --> 37:45.153
His department hasn't been
pulling its weight.

37:45.154 --> 37:48.320
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- I've been having troubles at home.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.823
My wife ran over
the children's dog with her car...

37:50.902 --> 37:52.904
then we had to buy a new dog.

37:52.988 --> 37:56.208
Then the new dog chewed up this
entire report that I'd been working on.

37:57.033 --> 38:00.162
Are you suggesting
that your dog ate your homework?

38:00.245 --> 38:02.043
In a way, yes, sir.

38:02.122 --> 38:05.922
This is not grade school, Davis!
Run at the back of the line.

38:06.001 --> 38:08.003
- Consider yourself on warning.
- Yes, sir.

38:08.086 --> 38:12.432
Everybody, check your pulse. Make sure
you're exercising at the optimum level.

38:13.550 --> 38:17.145
I'm a bit above my level.
I better stop running now, maybe.

38:17.220 --> 38:20.895
- I'm above too.
- I really don't care. Everybody, run!

38:20.974 --> 38:25.400
<i>I can't get anybody's approval
for the extra two trucks!</i>

38:25.478 --> 38:27.731
<i>Tucker, what're you
gonna do about it?</i>

38:28.982 --> 38:32.407
All right, look.
What does a boxcar cost?

38:32.527 --> 38:34.871
The transfer sheet
shows that somebody...

38:34.946 --> 38:37.415
is accumulating
an enormous block of our stock.

38:37.532 --> 38:40.911
- What do you think about that, Thomas?
- I think it's very encouraging.

38:40.994 --> 38:43.203
- You do, do you?
- Yes, sir.

38:43.204 --> 38:45.582
When a stock takes a dive
and somebody buys a ton of it...

38:45.665 --> 38:48.009
It means that stock is
on its way to a quick rebound.

38:48.084 --> 38:51.382
It means that the company
is ripe for a hostile takeover!

38:51.383 --> 38:54.428
- That's what I meant!
- A hostile takeover, sir?

38:54.507 --> 38:57.306
Yes. I'm afraid that's
what we're looking at.

38:57.385 --> 38:59.353
I want each of you
to examine your department...

38:59.429 --> 39:01.272
and see where you
can cut costs.

39:01.389 --> 39:03.357
Cut! Cut them to the core!

39:03.433 --> 39:06.357
We need to raise capital quickly
so we can boost stock support.

39:06.436 --> 39:10.236
Boost it!
Boost it to the moon!

39:10.315 --> 39:12.317
You gonna put that in writin'?

39:15.445 --> 39:17.243
Yeah.

39:17.322 --> 39:20.201
You tell the trucking company that
we have to service our customers.

39:20.283 --> 39:23.787
If they're not gonna help us,
we're gonna find somebody who will.

39:23.870 --> 39:25.668
Well, all right!

39:25.789 --> 39:29.339
That's what we need, some gutsy
decisions! I'll get back to you.

39:29.417 --> 39:31.590
Okay. Bye.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.256
Yes!

40:26.808 --> 40:29.059
I have got to get that report
by the end of the day, Art...

40:29.060 --> 40:30.733
or you're in the doghouse!

40:30.854 --> 40:32.652
I don't know.
Mr Prescott?

40:37.152 --> 40:39.621
I'm sorry this came in so
late, but it just arrived.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.115
It's about time!

40:47.662 --> 40:49.414
- This isn't the men's room.
- No.

40:49.497 --> 40:52.376
They took the urinals out last week.
I didn't like them.

40:52.459 --> 40:54.837
How about a paper cup?

40:54.919 --> 40:55.920
What?

40:56.004 --> 40:58.473
Sorry. I'm just about the only
woman executive at Pemrose.

40:58.548 --> 41:01.677
Some days, I have a chip
about the men's room.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.012
Sorry.

41:04.179 --> 41:06.102
Hey, nice office.

41:06.181 --> 41:09.355
Nice furniture.
It goes with your hair.

41:10.018 --> 41:13.067
Thank you. I like your suit.
It goes nicely with your nose.

41:15.690 --> 41:17.192
Well.

41:19.736 --> 41:22.205
This conversation
isn't going very well.

41:22.906 --> 41:27.286
Thank you. There's enough talk in
the world already. Good morning.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.545
That meant "good-bye."

41:36.211 --> 41:37.804
I have work.

41:42.091 --> 41:45.015
Sorry.
I have a lot of work myself.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.484
Good morning.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.159
I really swept her
off her feet.

42:19.462 --> 42:22.932
Nice furniture.
It goes with your hair.

42:27.554 --> 42:31.229
Hello. This is
Carlton Whitfield, 4319.

42:31.766 --> 42:35.145
That's right. I'm still waiting for that
secretary I requested last week.

42:37.522 --> 42:39.820
I realize you're
busy down there...

42:39.899 --> 42:42.368
but I'm typing my own letters
and answering my own calls...

42:42.443 --> 42:44.445
and it's getting to be a pain.

42:45.321 --> 42:46.789
Empty?

42:47.490 --> 42:51.290
Well, I've been here a week,
got my name on the door...

42:51.411 --> 42:54.130
got a desk full of supplies and
a geranium on my window ledge.

42:54.205 --> 42:56.549
What I don't have
is a secretary.

42:58.084 --> 43:00.052
Okay, I'll tell you what.

43:00.128 --> 43:03.598
I'll have Personnel send a boy up from
the mailroom with the requisitions.

43:03.715 --> 43:07.595
Just send me my secretary, okay?
Thank you very much.

43:23.067 --> 43:27.618
Got a memo here. Big cheese in 4319
wants his new secretary pronto.

43:27.697 --> 43:29.699
I got a memo here that's
burning up my fingers.

43:29.782 --> 43:34.333
New suit in 4319 wants his personalized
memos and stationery immediately.

43:34.334 --> 43:36.252
- This guy is hot.
- Who?

43:36.372 --> 43:38.295
I don't know.
Name's on the memo.

43:38.374 --> 43:41.924
He wants nameplates for his door,
and he wants it by noon. Okay?

43:42.003 --> 43:43.425
Smile.

43:47.717 --> 43:50.812
- You're late.
- I already done my rounds.

43:50.887 --> 43:52.560
You didn't punch in.

43:52.639 --> 43:56.519
Well, I couldn't wait to get to it.
Boy, I love my work.

43:56.643 --> 44:00.443
Punch in, then run this up to
Personnel and wait for an answer.

44:00.521 --> 44:02.068
Right.

44:22.835 --> 44:25.588
I'm Jean, your secretary.

44:25.672 --> 44:27.595
I'm not wearing anything.

44:27.674 --> 44:30.143
I see that.

44:30.551 --> 44:32.553
It was warm.

44:33.596 --> 44:36.475
Seems cooler now.
I'll get dressed.

44:37.725 --> 44:41.070
Yes, sir.
I'll move my stuff in.

44:41.229 --> 44:43.607
Great, Jean.
Good idea.

44:57.412 --> 44:59.380
Jean? I have
some notes here.

44:59.455 --> 45:02.379
I also have some charts,
some graphs, some tapes.

45:02.458 --> 45:04.961
They're all sorted by department.
Can you read my handwriting?

45:05.044 --> 45:06.796
- Sort of.
- Do your best.

45:06.921 --> 45:09.674
I need some poster boards, coloured
pencils, coloured push pins...

45:09.757 --> 45:14.354
T square, drawing table, lots of
pencils, and my lunch. Chinese?

45:17.682 --> 45:20.105
- Hey, 4319?
- Yeah.

45:24.397 --> 45:25.944
Great.

45:27.150 --> 45:29.448
- Morning.
- Morning.

45:35.074 --> 45:37.668
- Morning.
- Hi.

46:57.406 --> 47:00.205
Hello again.
Small world.

47:01.369 --> 47:03.212
Hello.

47:10.920 --> 47:13.298
Are you standing still
for some purpose?

47:14.632 --> 47:16.760
Hey, I'm just soaking up
the atmosphere.

47:19.095 --> 47:21.268
Executive lounge, huh?

47:21.347 --> 47:24.565
- Care to do a little lounging?
- No, I'm busy.

47:24.566 --> 47:27.779
Ron, did you get those figures
on transfer costs and insurance?

47:27.854 --> 47:30.824
Not yet.
Big delay in Chicago.

47:30.898 --> 47:34.027
- Damn! I really need them!
- Blame Chicago.

47:34.110 --> 47:36.112
- Maybe I can help.
- I'm sorry?

47:36.195 --> 47:37.993
Transfer costs
and insurance for what?

47:38.072 --> 47:40.791
By the time I explained,
I could find out myself.

47:41.284 --> 47:43.286
Ron.
Big weenie.

47:43.369 --> 47:46.168
Hey, listen. Why don't you
explain it to me over lunch?

47:46.247 --> 47:49.626
- I'll have the answer by dessert.
- I don't eat lunch.

47:50.918 --> 47:53.467
Why don't we start this again?
Carlton Whitfield. And you're?

47:53.588 --> 47:55.590
Annoyed.
Shit.

47:56.883 --> 48:00.260
You know, I'm just
trying to be friendly.

48:00.261 --> 48:03.606
You picked a bad time. I was counting
on those figures from Ron.

48:03.723 --> 48:05.771
- Christy Wills. How do you do?
- Good.

48:06.434 --> 48:09.233
Terrible news.
Just awful!

48:09.770 --> 48:12.023
Conference room, everybody.
Come on. On the double.

48:15.610 --> 48:17.863
- You don't eat lunch. Do you eat dinner?
- Occasionally.

48:17.945 --> 48:19.572
- Tonight?
- Booked.

48:19.655 --> 48:22.033
- Tomorrow night?
- Booked.

48:22.116 --> 48:24.995
All right, but don't beg, okay?
It's embarrassing.

48:30.625 --> 48:32.093
Who are you?

48:34.670 --> 48:37.173
Carlton Whitfield.
New employee.

48:40.218 --> 48:42.687
I didn't get a memo on that.

48:42.803 --> 48:44.396
You will.

48:44.472 --> 48:48.022
All right.
As long as I get the memo.

48:52.230 --> 48:56.360
The absolute worst has happened.
We are the target of a corporate raid.

48:56.442 --> 49:00.447
Donald Davenport
has filed a 13-D.

49:00.529 --> 49:02.497
A 13-D?

49:02.573 --> 49:04.575
He's acquired five
percent of the stock...

49:04.659 --> 49:09.460
and this is definitely the beginning of
a hostile takeover of our corporation.

49:09.538 --> 49:12.667
I think we all know what happened the
last time Davenport took over a company.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.343
Everyone was canned!

49:15.503 --> 49:18.677
Mr Prescott has sent down word
of what he wants us to do.

49:18.756 --> 49:22.386
We are to recommend cuts
in every department.

49:22.510 --> 49:27.562
Our job is to slash the red ink
in every nook and cranny...

49:27.640 --> 49:31.565
because our company needs
the cash for its defence.

49:33.521 --> 49:35.819
Anybody wanna fire
the first shot?

49:37.358 --> 49:38.860
Kill Toledo.

49:41.946 --> 49:43.994
If we close down
our distribution centres...

49:44.073 --> 49:45.871
in Toledo, Joplin, Jacksonville...

49:45.992 --> 49:48.370
we'll slash the red ink
completely off the books.

49:51.414 --> 49:53.837
Whitfield, you don't have to
raise your hand. Just speak.

49:53.916 --> 49:55.634
Thank you.

49:55.710 --> 49:59.212
Well, I know I'm new here
and everything.

49:59.213 --> 50:01.386
On the surface, these cuts
seem like a good idea...

50:01.465 --> 50:03.138
"Seem like a good idea"?

50:03.259 --> 50:05.728
But closing down those distribution
centres would be a big mistake.

50:05.803 --> 50:09.307
It so happens that those closings
are exactly what Mr Prescott wants.

50:10.224 --> 50:12.727
Well, then Mr Prescott hasn't
thought things through very well.

50:13.644 --> 50:16.397
I'm going to tell him you said that.

50:16.897 --> 50:19.070
Good. Closing down
those centres...

50:19.150 --> 50:21.448
will put a strain on
this company's cash position.

50:21.527 --> 50:24.701
In the long run, those cuts are going
to hurt this company's innate value.

50:24.702 --> 50:28.122
Innate value?
What is he talking about?

50:28.200 --> 50:30.999
Davidson here will back me up
on this. Davidson?

50:31.078 --> 50:32.671
I'm Proctor.
He's Davidson.

50:32.788 --> 50:34.790
Well, damn it,
Davidson, tell him!

50:34.874 --> 50:37.593
You wrote a memo to Mr Thomas
explaining what I'm talking about.

50:37.668 --> 50:40.046
Well, how did you know
I wrote that memo?

50:45.801 --> 50:47.803
How did I know
you wrote that memo?

50:50.890 --> 50:54.360
Who else could write
that memo, Davidson?

50:55.186 --> 50:57.780
That memo was famous.

50:57.855 --> 50:59.857
That memo was a masterpiece.

50:59.940 --> 51:03.820
Clear, concise, to the point.
That was the best damn memo I ever read!

51:04.278 --> 51:07.655
In fact, that memo wasn't even a memo.
That memo was literature.

51:07.656 --> 51:09.454
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

51:09.533 --> 51:13.037
If you have finished your book report,
could you explain what your point is?

51:13.162 --> 51:16.632
- The point is, we gotta be bold.
- That's my point.

51:16.707 --> 51:19.631
We gotta build.
We gotta expand.

51:19.710 --> 51:22.509
Expanding is the only way
to help the situation.

51:22.630 --> 51:24.598
We gotta make this
company so damn strong...

51:24.673 --> 51:28.018
Davenport won't be able to find anyone
willing to give up Pemrose stock.

51:28.094 --> 51:31.268
It'll be too damn valuable.
Then we'll buy his ass out!

51:37.103 --> 51:39.606
- How old are you, Mister...
- Whitfield.

51:39.772 --> 51:41.774
- Yes.
- Twenty-four.

51:41.857 --> 51:44.406
I think you should keep quiet
until you're at least 25.

51:45.361 --> 51:48.991
If I may, I don't think Whitfield's
age should be an issue here.

51:49.115 --> 51:52.119
No one is interested
in your opinion, Davis.

51:52.201 --> 51:54.579
We gotta block that takeover.

51:54.662 --> 51:56.664
I'm too old to look
for another job.

51:56.747 --> 51:58.875
Nobody in their right mind
would hire me.

52:02.545 --> 52:06.391
This meeting is going nowhere!

52:06.507 --> 52:09.056
Mr Prescott's command stands!

52:09.135 --> 52:12.355
We are to find those cuts!

52:12.430 --> 52:14.273
Meeting adjourned.

52:19.478 --> 52:22.277
You'll pick up the coats.
That looks like one only a lot smaller.

52:22.356 --> 52:24.950
Hey! Harvard!
Where the hell've you been?

52:25.025 --> 52:29.326
Personnel. You said to wait for
an answer. They are real slow up there.

52:30.531 --> 52:33.080
There's something going on
around here, Foster.

52:33.159 --> 52:36.584
I'm gonna be on you like a rash.
You got that? Like a rash.

52:36.704 --> 52:39.924
Won't the other guys get jealous?
Heads!

54:09.713 --> 54:11.715
You guys were good tonight.

54:23.310 --> 54:26.985
Oh, God.
What are you doin' here?

54:27.064 --> 54:30.364
Brantley, darling, I heard you calling
me telepathically... I'm very psychic...

54:30.442 --> 54:32.536
so of course
I rushed right over.

54:34.113 --> 54:38.334
- I would've used the phone.
- Mental telepathy's much more reliable.

54:39.994 --> 54:42.042
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

54:44.707 --> 54:47.301
Yeah. Sorry.

54:47.376 --> 54:49.128
Just a minute.

54:59.722 --> 55:02.225
Father used to live like this
before he founded Pemrose.

55:02.391 --> 55:04.143
Aunt Vera...

55:04.226 --> 55:07.526
I had a hell of a day,
and I really have to get some sleep.

55:08.731 --> 55:11.280
Brantley, you're a young man.

55:12.443 --> 55:14.912
Young men have lots of energy.

55:18.032 --> 55:19.204
Look.

55:21.160 --> 55:23.834
- We have a problem.
- What?

55:25.164 --> 55:28.168
Your husband is my boss.

55:28.250 --> 55:31.424
Oh, him.
We won't tell him.

55:32.463 --> 55:35.137
Besides,
Howard's working late tonight.

55:35.257 --> 55:37.931
On whom, I have no idea.

55:39.386 --> 55:42.560
You look very beautiful
tonight, Christy.

55:42.640 --> 55:46.315
Thank you. Now, there are some
business things we should discuss.

55:46.435 --> 55:49.939
Do you think that this restaurant
has an upstairs with beds in it?

55:50.022 --> 55:52.445
Howard, please!

55:52.524 --> 55:55.994
I don't feel altogether good
about what's happened between us.

55:56.695 --> 55:58.993
You are married.

55:59.073 --> 56:01.792
- I'm not married.
- You are married!

56:01.867 --> 56:05.917
Well, yeah, I am married,
but she and I have an understanding.

56:26.183 --> 56:28.811
- I love you.
- I don't really think so.

56:28.977 --> 56:32.322
Well, then I lust after you.
That oughta be worth something.

56:32.398 --> 56:34.776
To you, perhaps.
Now, let's talk business.

56:34.858 --> 56:37.281
I pitched the need for cutbacks
at the meeting today...

56:37.361 --> 56:40.579
but a dissenting opinion was offered
by Carlton Whitfield.

56:40.580 --> 56:43.371
Who's Carlton Whitfield?
I didn't hire any Carlton Whitfield.

56:43.492 --> 56:45.039
Somebody did.

56:45.119 --> 56:48.293
- Oh, my God. Donald Davenport.
- What?

56:48.372 --> 56:51.501
He may be a plant for Davenport,
gathering information on the takeover.

56:51.583 --> 56:55.383
It's just like him. I want you
to get close to this guy Whitfield.

56:55.462 --> 56:57.180
Find out what he's up to.

56:57.256 --> 57:00.430
- You want me to spy on him?
- No, I don't want you to spy on him.

57:00.509 --> 57:02.477
I want you to get
to be friends with him...

57:02.553 --> 57:04.555
then rifle through his papers
and tell me what you find.

57:04.638 --> 57:06.515
That's spying, Howard.

57:06.598 --> 57:09.647
Look, you have got to drop
this incessant innocence.

57:09.727 --> 57:13.698
Life is harsh and ugly,
and only the strong survive.

57:13.772 --> 57:15.866
Or didn't they teach you that
at Harvard?

57:19.903 --> 57:22.452
- What you got in there?
- My lunch.

57:22.531 --> 57:24.625
Your lunch?
In a briefcase?

57:24.700 --> 57:27.453
Yeah.
Ran out of brown bags.

57:28.829 --> 57:31.082
One of you guys got
a spare pair of laces?

57:31.165 --> 57:33.588
Hey, man, I had a babe last night
you wouldn't believe.

57:33.667 --> 57:38.218
"Ta-Na's" out to here, man.
She was fine. Where'd he go?

57:55.731 --> 57:58.530
- Coming through. Excuse me.
- Take it easy. Come on.

57:58.609 --> 58:00.782
Sorry.

58:32.267 --> 58:34.019
- What a nightmare.
- Stuck again?

58:34.102 --> 58:36.230
- I'm all right, though. I'm fine.
- You okay?

58:36.313 --> 58:40.363
- You all right?
- Don't worry about me. Thanks.

58:40.442 --> 58:44.743
Jean, transcribe these notes. There's
some things on there I need right away.

58:45.364 --> 58:48.368
Make copies of this,
copies of this.

58:48.450 --> 58:50.828
- Did you get those supplies I needed?
- Yes, sir.

58:50.911 --> 58:54.006
Good.
I'll be back later.

58:59.670 --> 59:01.672
- Gentlemen.
- Good morning.

59:10.264 --> 59:13.108
- Goddam that thing!
- This thing stuck again?

59:16.436 --> 59:18.313
These elevators are stuck again?

59:20.858 --> 59:24.158
I'm sick and tired of these
elevators always gettin' stuck.

59:31.869 --> 59:35.214
Hi, Jean. Will you take
those to the cleaners?

59:58.270 --> 01:00:01.069
These are some of the notes
I found in Whitfield's office.

01:00:01.148 --> 01:00:04.197
If you want anything more,
you can go after it yourself.

01:00:04.443 --> 01:00:06.571
Do you think he's working
for Davenport?

01:00:06.653 --> 01:00:10.829
I have no idea.
I'm out of the spy business.

01:00:15.787 --> 01:00:18.666
We can't wait for Whitfield
any longer. Let's get started.

01:00:19.291 --> 01:00:23.044
Davis here has prepared what I'm sure
is a thoroughly incompetent analysis...

01:00:23.045 --> 01:00:25.548
but let's listen to him read it
before we start criticizing.

01:00:25.631 --> 01:00:27.599
Fine. I won't read it at all.
Is that all right?

01:00:27.674 --> 01:00:30.723
You have a bad attitude, and I am
gonna tell Mr Prescott about it.

01:00:30.802 --> 01:00:33.351
Does anybody else
have anything to say?

01:00:35.557 --> 01:00:38.310
Hi. Sorry, I'm late.

01:00:38.393 --> 01:00:40.566
Sorry.
Hi, everybody.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.569
Casual attire today, Whitfield?

01:00:45.901 --> 01:00:47.653
Yeah, trousers, yeah.

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:50.782
New product line.
Testing 'em out. Pretty good.

01:00:50.864 --> 01:00:53.367
- Good fabric.
- Good idea.

01:00:53.909 --> 01:00:56.583
- Christy, you have something to say.
- Yes.

01:00:56.662 --> 01:00:59.632
I came up with some more cuts
in the Middle States area.

01:00:59.706 --> 01:01:01.549
Let me pass these out.

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:05.004
Why can't you be
more like her, Davis?

01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:09.050
Mr Prescott!
Well, what a surprise!

01:01:10.217 --> 01:01:13.560
Art, I haven't received
the full report on the cutbacks yet...

01:01:13.561 --> 01:01:16.147
so I thought I'd drop in
and see what the problem is.

01:01:16.264 --> 01:01:19.188
No problem.
No, sir. Everything is tip-top.

01:01:19.267 --> 01:01:21.565
Whitfield has pointed out
a few wrinkles...

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:24.569
and we are going
to iron those wrinkles out.

01:01:25.607 --> 01:01:27.701
You don't mind if I stay
for a few minutes, do you?

01:01:27.776 --> 01:01:29.528
Yes, sir.

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:33.165
- Which one of you is Whitfield?
- Oh, my God!

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.164
Nosebleed! Dry heat!
Get 'em all the time!

01:01:36.243 --> 01:01:39.042
Oh, God!
No sight for the squeamish.

01:01:40.372 --> 01:01:42.081
Who was that?

01:01:42.082 --> 01:01:44.380
Well, that's the new boy, Whitfield.

01:01:53.385 --> 01:01:54.637
Sorry.

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.143
Needed some supplies.

01:01:57.222 --> 01:01:59.520
Well, back to business.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.228
A few of these, and...

01:02:03.311 --> 01:02:04.984
Oh, God!

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:08.405
You're from Receiving,
aren't you?

01:02:09.317 --> 01:02:11.445
<i>I see you're a workaholic.</i>

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.958
Yeah, well...

01:02:18.618 --> 01:02:20.746
I got a lot of work to do.

01:02:22.664 --> 01:02:26.794
- What are you doing here so late?
- I'm a workaholic too.

01:02:27.294 --> 01:02:29.797
Wow. You mean we have
something in common?

01:02:32.507 --> 01:02:36.683
So, what's all this
supposed to be?

01:02:36.762 --> 01:02:41.186
It's the heart and soul of an idea
you hated: expansion in the Midwest.

01:02:41.187 --> 01:02:43.481
I don't hate it.
I just think it's risky.

01:02:43.643 --> 01:02:45.611
Furthermore,
Mr Prescott doesn't want it.

01:02:45.687 --> 01:02:48.065
It's a waste of time to pursue it.

01:02:49.024 --> 01:02:51.743
But if something's right,
how can it be a waste of time?

01:02:51.818 --> 01:02:55.072
There is no right or wrong.
There is only opinion.

01:02:57.741 --> 01:03:01.666
You know, in some states,
you can get arrested for saying that.

01:03:03.497 --> 01:03:05.920
All right. Convince me.

01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:09.545
Convince me then that
your opinion is the right one.

01:03:10.837 --> 01:03:12.339
All right.

01:03:12.881 --> 01:03:16.010
Take a look at this.
And this.

01:03:16.676 --> 01:03:19.304
<i>And, yeah.</i>

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:21.727
<i>peruse that.</i>

01:03:21.807 --> 01:03:25.059
Why do you keep saying
the exact opposite of what I say?

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.906
- 'Cause you keep saying stupid things.
- Will you look at these figures?

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.153
They prove that
the elimination of salaries...

01:03:31.233 --> 01:03:33.907
would create a war chest for the
defence of the Pemrose Corporation.

01:03:33.985 --> 01:03:36.079
- Can't you see that?
- No, I can't. I'll tell you why.

01:03:36.154 --> 01:03:39.283
Closing those factories is just gonna
send a panic through the market.

01:03:39.366 --> 01:03:42.870
- That might happen or that might not.
- No, it will happen.

01:03:42.994 --> 01:03:46.715
All right, close the centres, put
thousands of people out of work.

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:49.634
You're gonna waste all your profits
on unemployment contributions...

01:03:49.709 --> 01:03:52.337
severance pay, union lawsuits.

01:03:53.171 --> 01:03:54.844
Are you all right?

01:03:54.923 --> 01:03:57.722
- My blood sugar's dropping.
- What?

01:03:57.801 --> 01:04:00.224
It's just my mind wandered in
the middle of what you were saying.

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:04.024
It means I need food.
Do you wanna get a bite?

01:04:04.099 --> 01:04:08.070
- Yeah, come on. I'll buy you dinner.
- No, no, no. Dutch.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:13.867
Just tell me one more time
what your solution is to this crisis.

01:04:13.942 --> 01:04:17.822
- We don't cut. We expand.
- I agree.

01:04:17.904 --> 01:04:21.249
Expansion is a positive reaction
to the universe.

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:23.998
While retraction
or cutting back or pulling off...

01:04:24.077 --> 01:04:26.751
Those are all negative forces.

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:30.926
I used to be very negative, and
then I took this personality workshop.

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:33.302
My whole life turned around.

01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:36.260
Hiya.
My name's Sheila.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.344
You make a good-lookin' couple.
How long you been goin' together?

01:04:40.427 --> 01:04:44.102
- About 20 minutes.
- First date, huh? Good luck.

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:46.183
No, we're business colleagues.

01:04:46.266 --> 01:04:48.564
Colleagues!
Who needs that?

01:04:48.643 --> 01:04:50.862
You should go together.
You look good together.

01:04:55.275 --> 01:04:57.118
Did you wanna order?

01:04:58.069 --> 01:05:01.869
- Yeah, we need to see some menus.
- Menus! I'm sorry.

01:05:02.949 --> 01:05:06.453
I'm studying to be an actress. I'm
a better actress than I am a waitress.

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:09.460
Concentration, that's my big problem.
I'll be right back.

01:05:11.958 --> 01:05:14.004
Well, Sheila's in favour
of expansion.

01:05:14.005 --> 01:05:18.303
We should bring her to our next meeting.
Art Thomas would like her a lot.

01:05:18.673 --> 01:05:21.301
Sheila is also in favour
of us seeing each other.

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:24.763
- Yes, well, Sheila is clearly a nut.
- I heard that.

01:05:24.846 --> 01:05:27.144
You should try to be
more positive with your life...

01:05:27.265 --> 01:05:29.609
or you're gonna
wind up miserable.

01:05:29.684 --> 01:05:31.186
She heard me.

01:05:34.856 --> 01:05:38.317
I'm having a nice time.
How 'bout you?

01:05:38.318 --> 01:05:40.412
Yes, very nice.

01:05:40.487 --> 01:05:42.410
Well, it's pleasant walking.

01:05:42.489 --> 01:05:45.083
I mean,
I don't want to imply anything.

01:05:46.952 --> 01:05:50.832
About your expansion plan,
I did some checking...

01:05:50.914 --> 01:05:55.761
and we can get some tax breaks if we
put up a facility in the Midwest region.

01:05:56.503 --> 01:05:58.972
You checked?
Earlier today?

01:05:59.047 --> 01:06:00.674
That's great.

01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:03.431
The powers that be seem
to want the cutting, but I...

01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:08.061
I've been trying to stay open
to your ideas... your business ideas.

01:06:08.181 --> 01:06:09.854
That's great.

01:06:16.147 --> 01:06:18.866
Okay, so you're
open to my business ideas.

01:06:18.942 --> 01:06:22.027
Now, how about
my after-work ideas?

01:06:22.028 --> 01:06:25.783
Don't push. Yesterday,
I thought you were obnoxious.

01:06:28.994 --> 01:06:31.543
You know, a lot of people
start out that way.

01:06:33.039 --> 01:06:36.134
- They usually end up gettin' married.
- Don't hold your breath.

01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:37.927
Come on.

01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:42.925
Look, I think you're
secretly crazy about me.

01:06:43.008 --> 01:06:46.308
And I think you'd feel a lot better
if you'd just admit it.

01:06:47.345 --> 01:06:51.100
Come on. You'll like me.
I'm an acquired taste.

01:07:07.866 --> 01:07:11.086
My dad insisted
on buying me this.

01:07:12.996 --> 01:07:15.044
A round-trip ticket
back to Kansas.

01:07:16.916 --> 01:07:18.918
I almost traded it in
a couple of times.

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:21.801
But now, it's kind of a symbol.

01:07:21.921 --> 01:07:24.140
The day I use this ticket...

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:26.843
is the day New York
has beaten me.

01:07:28.887 --> 01:07:30.889
You know, I just
noticed something.

01:07:31.431 --> 01:07:35.311
- You're kind of a mess.
- Thank you.

01:07:35.393 --> 01:07:38.567
- Did anybody ever tell you that?
- You're the first.

01:07:38.646 --> 01:07:40.990
So what I was wonderin' was...

01:07:43.151 --> 01:07:46.362
how you can be so
incredibly beautiful...

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:48.491
and be such a mess?

01:07:51.242 --> 01:07:53.745
When two people get involved
on a project together...

01:07:53.828 --> 01:07:57.173
there's a danger of getting
emotionally involved.

01:07:58.583 --> 01:08:00.426
That would be bad.

01:08:00.502 --> 01:08:03.847
They confuse the intensity
of their involvement on the project...

01:08:03.922 --> 01:08:06.175
and mistake it
as a relationship.

01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:12.930
- What are you, a shrink?
- It's happened to me.

01:08:12.931 --> 01:08:15.229
It's actually still happening
to me, I guess.

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:17.606
And then...

01:08:17.685 --> 01:08:21.154
the project ends and they find
they don't have anything to talk about.

01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:25.323
Okay, it's settled then.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:30.745
We won't get involved while
we're working on this project.

01:08:32.826 --> 01:08:34.372
Right.

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:44.304
So who is he?

01:08:44.379 --> 01:08:45.756
Who?

01:08:45.839 --> 01:08:48.763
Who?
My competition.

01:08:48.841 --> 01:08:50.515
Just a guy.

01:08:51.636 --> 01:08:53.854
All right, so why don't
we call this guy?

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:55.932
Tell him you met a new guy.
The whole thing is off.

01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:59.770
- I can't call him.
- Why not?

01:08:59.853 --> 01:09:02.231
His wife might answer
the phone.

01:09:04.732 --> 01:09:07.359
- Big mistake.
- Yeah, well, let's not talk about it.

01:09:07.444 --> 01:09:10.413
- I've done a lot of stupid things...
- I bet you have.

01:09:10.488 --> 01:09:12.240
- But I have never...
- Ever?

01:09:14.908 --> 01:09:17.412
Been involved with
a married man.

01:09:17.871 --> 01:09:20.545
Well, he was sort of separated
when we started.

01:09:23.667 --> 01:09:26.091
Yeah, well, it turned
out to be a lie.

01:09:26.171 --> 01:09:28.765
The whole thing was a mistake.

01:09:29.883 --> 01:09:32.727
But we live and we learn
and we move on...

01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:48.944
That wasn't bad.

01:09:50.111 --> 01:09:51.533
Thank you.

01:09:53.865 --> 01:09:56.288
Can you do it again
just as good?

01:09:59.078 --> 01:10:01.046
I could try.

01:11:11.317 --> 01:11:14.161
- Where were you all weekend?
- At least begin with "good morning."

01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:16.740
I'm madder than hell!

01:11:17.782 --> 01:11:20.376
I want to know why
you weren't answering your phone.

01:11:20.451 --> 01:11:22.419
I owe a lot to you, Howard.

01:11:22.495 --> 01:11:24.873
I'll always be grateful for the chance
you gave me in this company...

01:11:25.039 --> 01:11:26.791
and the things I've learned.

01:11:27.333 --> 01:11:30.587
What is this?
What are you leading up to?

01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:32.468
<i>I wanna work with you.</i>

01:11:32.547 --> 01:11:35.346
<i>I respect you more
than you know, but...</i>

01:11:36.259 --> 01:11:39.980
I can't be involved with you
outside the office any more.

01:11:42.223 --> 01:11:43.975
Hello?

01:11:50.273 --> 01:11:55.029
Yes, I'm looking for the transportation
costs from Toledo dating September...

01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:56.909
I'll call you back.

01:12:00.283 --> 01:12:03.253
Look, I'm not
gonna pressure you on this.

01:12:03.328 --> 01:12:05.205
I want you to take your own time...

01:12:06.039 --> 01:12:08.417
and decide what's best for you.

01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:10.259
Thank you.

01:12:12.503 --> 01:12:15.507
I do think the timing's
a little ironic, though.

01:12:16.466 --> 01:12:18.514
I was gonna tell you
last night...

01:12:19.385 --> 01:12:22.730
that Vera and I have agreed
on terms for a divorce.

01:12:24.515 --> 01:12:28.236
I only wish that Vera and I
could have worked things out sooner.

01:12:28.895 --> 01:12:31.865
That way, you and I
might have had a chance.

01:12:34.108 --> 01:12:37.078
This arrived this morning
by messenger.

01:12:38.237 --> 01:12:40.740
Davenport has called
an emergency meeting...

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:44.498
of the board of directors
for Monday morning...

01:12:44.619 --> 01:12:47.042
and he's offering
to take over the company.

01:12:48.748 --> 01:12:52.798
I'm inviting all key personnel to spend
the weekend at my house in Litchfield.

01:12:53.628 --> 01:12:55.471
I'd like you to be there too.

01:12:56.756 --> 01:12:58.758
Of course I'll be there.

01:13:01.052 --> 01:13:04.477
One more question... personal.

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:08.818
Just out of curiosity,
who were you with last night?

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.444
Whitfield.
Carlton Whitfield.

01:13:14.774 --> 01:13:18.244
It was all business.
Some of his ideas are brilliant.

01:13:18.319 --> 01:13:21.744
I'm looking forward to hearing 'em.
I have to talk to him today.

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:27.834
Those notes that I took from Whitfield's
office... I'd like them back, please.

01:13:27.912 --> 01:13:30.756
Of course.
I'll get them to you.

01:13:30.832 --> 01:13:33.005
Heads up. Thanks.

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:38.839
What's your hurry?
What's goin' on?

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.218
I got a special delivery
here marked "urgent."

01:13:41.342 --> 01:13:43.060
I'm watching you, Foster.

01:13:43.136 --> 01:13:44.934
Just remember, every minute...

01:13:45.012 --> 01:13:46.980
God is watching you.

01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:52.229
Excuse me, Miss, I'm a reporter for the
Times, and I couldn't help noticing...

01:13:52.311 --> 01:13:54.405
you look like a woman
who's recently been made love to.

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.778
- Not here.
- You weren't made love to here.

01:13:56.858 --> 01:13:59.407
Was it anywhere within the New York
State lines, because we usually let...

01:13:59.485 --> 01:14:02.409
the philadelphia Gazette
handle Pennsylvania.

01:14:04.615 --> 01:14:06.709
What's up?
You seem kind of upset.

01:14:06.784 --> 01:14:08.878
I hate men.

01:14:08.953 --> 01:14:11.206
Well, I'm glad
I'm not one of 'em.

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:15.176
Listen, there's something
I gotta explain to you.

01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:19.006
I have something to tell you too.
I did something I wish I hadn't, and...

01:14:19.007 --> 01:14:20.507
All right, look.

01:14:22.008 --> 01:14:24.477
- This weekend?
- Can't.

01:14:24.552 --> 01:14:28.853
- I have some loose ends to tie up.
- Good!

01:14:29.056 --> 01:14:32.185
- I'll take care of it.
- Have a nice weekend. See you Monday.

01:14:37.565 --> 01:14:39.613
Excuse me, Miss.
I'm sorry. Excuse me!

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:43.279
You didn't see me.
I wasn't here.

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:50.040
- Where is he? Where'd he go?
- I didn't see him. He wasn't here.

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:01.719
You still here?

01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:04.388
You look great.

01:15:08.179 --> 01:15:10.557
The end of the second lap,
you still got a comfortable lead.

01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:17.647
Excuse me again.

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:22.110
- Hi, boss.
- Shit!

01:15:25.196 --> 01:15:26.743
Bye, boss.

01:15:29.951 --> 01:15:31.828
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

01:15:31.911 --> 01:15:33.879
Looking for Whitfield.
Got a delivery for him.

01:15:33.955 --> 01:15:35.582
Why are you wearing a suit?

01:15:37.291 --> 01:15:40.386
- Because of the funeral.
- Whose funeral?

01:15:40.461 --> 01:15:43.931
A friend. He died.
We buried him.

01:15:44.966 --> 01:15:46.809
What is all this stuff?

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.856
Production performance charts
for the Midwest region, I guess.

01:15:54.976 --> 01:15:56.444
Where is Whitfield?

01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:59.272
He's not here?

01:15:59.814 --> 01:16:03.316
- Have you ever seen Whitfield?
- Yes, sir.

01:16:03.317 --> 01:16:04.944
Well, lots of times.

01:16:05.111 --> 01:16:07.660
I deliver here every day.
Great guy.

01:16:08.614 --> 01:16:10.662
How does he get
all this information?

01:16:10.741 --> 01:16:14.086
Well, it's available in most
quarterly stock reports...

01:16:15.329 --> 01:16:17.002
Probably.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:21.636
- Take this up to my office.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:27.675 --> 01:16:30.895
- You're not comin'?
- I'll be there in a minute.

01:16:42.481 --> 01:16:44.654
One question:
What the hell are you doin'?

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:47.237
- Having a nervous breakdown.
- No wonder.

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.164
Look, nothin' good can come from this.
If you get caught, you get canned.

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:52.458
If you don't get caught, you become
one of them... a suit.

01:16:52.533 --> 01:16:56.959
- It's a no-win situation.
- I'm still a half a step ahead of them.

01:17:08.215 --> 01:17:12.510
<i>I hear music when I look at you</i>

01:17:12.511 --> 01:17:15.731
Aunt Vera, hi.
How are you?

01:17:17.808 --> 01:17:20.857
<i>I'm in the mood for love</i>

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:24.783
<i>Simply because you're near me</i>

01:17:24.857 --> 01:17:27.781
A medley. Gee, that's nice.

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:29.908
Why are you singing a medley?

01:17:29.987 --> 01:17:33.912
<i>I get no kick from champagne</i>

01:17:33.991 --> 01:17:39.839
<i>- Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all</i>
- Please, don't sing any more.

01:17:41.207 --> 01:17:42.459
Oh, God!

01:17:42.583 --> 01:17:45.336
I haven't sung in years.
You see what you do to me?

01:17:45.419 --> 01:17:47.092
He's on his way up.

01:17:47.171 --> 01:17:50.766
He's gonna be here any minute.
Why are you doing this?

01:17:50.925 --> 01:17:53.599
- I'm going to have you for lunch.
- Can't I get you a ham and cheese?

01:17:53.678 --> 01:17:55.680
Look at that
cute little Adam's apple.

01:17:56.722 --> 01:17:59.601
Listen. Oh, shit. Since the last time
we met, there's been a change.

01:17:59.684 --> 01:18:01.812
Yes, nice suit, Brantley.

01:18:02.728 --> 01:18:06.323
Look, what I mean to say is...
Oh, Christ!

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.068
- I'm not free any more.
- You're gonna charge me?

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:11.654
You're getting awfully cynical.
Does your mother know about this?

01:18:11.737 --> 01:18:16.117
- No, I mean I'm not available!
- Good, you're not gonna charge me.

01:18:16.701 --> 01:18:19.454
Don't worry, Brantley. I don't wanna
marry you. I'm already married.

01:18:19.578 --> 01:18:22.081
- I just wanna love you.
- Love.

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:25.543
I don't mean love as in two star-crossed
virginettes running through the clover.

01:18:25.668 --> 01:18:29.136
Nothing icky like that. I'm a practical
woman. You should be a practical man.

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:32.851
If you just let me, I could steer you
through these shark-infested waters...

01:18:32.967 --> 01:18:35.390
of this stupid company
just like I steered Howard.

01:18:35.469 --> 01:18:38.598
Look, I like you. I really like you.
But I gotta tell you.

01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:42.436
I've become seriously and emotionally
involved with someone who isn't my aunt.

01:18:43.144 --> 01:18:46.114
- I forgive you, Brantley.
- Listen!

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:49.196
- There is someone else in my life!
- I got it. I don't care.

01:18:49.275 --> 01:18:51.243
There's someone else
in my life too.

01:18:51.318 --> 01:18:54.367
Maybe we should introduce
your girlfriend and my husband.

01:18:54.447 --> 01:18:58.168
Look, I don't wanna get rough with you,
but I'll belt you around if I have to.

01:18:58.284 --> 01:19:02.039
Jesus Christ, Vera!
I'm gonna get fired. Gimme a break.

01:19:02.121 --> 01:19:04.294
Don't whine, Brantley.
Life is too short.

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:07.798
Before you know it, you'll be 25,
wondering where it all went.

01:19:10.963 --> 01:19:13.967
- What the hell is this?
- He fainted.

01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:15.302
Fainted?

01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:20.140
- Dead away.
- Actually, he hit his head.

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:23.351
- It was like fainting. Knocked out.
- Hit his head on what?

01:19:23.434 --> 01:19:24.902
- The floor.
- The ceiling.

01:19:24.903 --> 01:19:26.362
- Which one?
- Both.

01:19:26.437 --> 01:19:28.690
- Neither.
- What the hell happened?

01:19:28.773 --> 01:19:31.492
Uncle Howard, it was like this.

01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:34.036
I walked into your office...

01:19:34.779 --> 01:19:37.030
and I saw this beautiful woman...

01:19:37.031 --> 01:19:39.282
who I had never seen
before in my life.

01:19:39.283 --> 01:19:43.208
And imagine my surprise
when I found out it was my Aunt Vera.

01:19:43.287 --> 01:19:47.292
Well, he was so excited,
his blood pressure shot up...

01:19:47.374 --> 01:19:49.422
and then he fell and
hit his head on the floor.

01:19:49.502 --> 01:19:54.383
Out like a light.
So I crawled deliriously to the sofa.

01:19:54.465 --> 01:19:57.059
- And I rushed to his aid.
- And you walked in.

01:19:57.218 --> 01:20:01.439
And shame on you for not telling me
our nephew's working for the company.

01:20:01.514 --> 01:20:03.312
Our nephew works
for the company.

01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:05.267
I've got a million things
to take care of today.

01:20:05.351 --> 01:20:07.319
- Why are you here?
- Lunch.

01:20:07.394 --> 01:20:10.489
- We were supposed to have lunch.
- I've had my lunch.

01:20:10.564 --> 01:20:14.364
- You don't seem to realize...
- I do realize, Howard.

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:17.743
So, you won't mind if Brantley and I go
out to lunch to get better acquainted?

01:20:17.822 --> 01:20:21.908
- Fine.
- I can't. I gotta go to a funeral.

01:20:21.909 --> 01:20:24.128
You said you already went.

01:20:25.788 --> 01:20:28.462
You know, in my grief, I forgot.

01:20:31.168 --> 01:20:34.593
Why don't we bring Brantley out
to the house this weekend for the party?

01:20:34.672 --> 01:20:36.515
I mean, he is family.

01:20:37.675 --> 01:20:41.555
Yes, you know, that might be
a very good idea.

01:20:41.637 --> 01:20:43.685
No, I don't think
I'd fit in, Aunt Vera.

01:20:43.764 --> 01:20:46.483
But you do fit in, Brantley.

01:20:46.559 --> 01:20:48.653
I'll make sure he has
a wonderful time.

01:20:48.727 --> 01:20:52.732
All right. It's settled.
Now, can I get back to work here?

01:20:54.024 --> 01:20:56.573
It'll be nice to have
a playmate for the weekend.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.170
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh, yeah, Brantley.

01:21:10.249 --> 01:21:13.799
I want you to know I've been
watching you very closely lately.

01:21:13.878 --> 01:21:17.633
- You have?
- I know everything you've been up to.

01:21:18.591 --> 01:21:20.935
- You do?
- Everything.

01:21:22.595 --> 01:21:26.600
Sir, I can explain this.
See, I didn't know who that was...

01:21:26.682 --> 01:21:29.481
I know, for example, that you've
been working hard in the mailroom.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.688
You've kept your eyes open
and your nose clean.

01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:33.647
You stayed out of trouble.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.193
I'm gonna reward you for that
one of these days.

01:21:38.068 --> 01:21:41.663
But first I'd like to ask
a favour of you.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.867
You name it, sir.

01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:47.294
We'll talk about it
while we work out.

01:21:49.038 --> 01:21:51.461
You like to sweat,
don't you, Brantley?

01:21:57.087 --> 01:22:00.307
Your Aunt Vera seems to have
taken an instant liking to you.

01:22:02.301 --> 01:22:05.225
- I hadn't noticed.
- It's obvious.

01:22:05.304 --> 01:22:08.604
I think she'd like to get
to know you a lot better.

01:22:08.682 --> 01:22:10.480
I want to encourage that.

01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:13.900
I'd like you to spend
lots of time with Aunt Vera...

01:22:13.979 --> 01:22:16.027
at the party this weekend.

01:22:17.983 --> 01:22:22.363
Men like us can't be locked in
to one woman, Brantley.

01:22:22.446 --> 01:22:26.872
We need variety.
Keeps us young, energetic, competitive.

01:22:26.992 --> 01:22:31.372
You get my meaning? Of course you do.
We're men of the world, right?

01:22:31.373 --> 01:22:34.000
Now, a problem has developed.

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:37.804
- I have a friend, a companion...
- A girl.

01:22:38.379 --> 01:22:41.303
She's been getting
a little antsy lately.

01:22:41.382 --> 01:22:43.180
Wants me to leave my wife.

01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:46.934
Well, I'm not about to leave my wife...
not for her, not for anyone.

01:22:47.012 --> 01:22:50.607
I just need a little time to get
the situation under control again.

01:22:50.683 --> 01:22:53.357
- Understand?
- Not altogether.

01:22:53.477 --> 01:22:55.855
Well, I'm inviting her out
to the party this weekend...

01:22:55.938 --> 01:22:58.441
and we're gonna spend
a little time together...

01:22:58.565 --> 01:23:01.034
which is why I need you
to keep your Aunt Vera...

01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:03.829
occupied as much as possible.

01:23:03.904 --> 01:23:06.282
- Get the picture?
- Yeah, wide-screen.

01:23:06.365 --> 01:23:10.038
- But I got some big plans this weekend.
- Fine. I won't forget this favour.

01:23:10.039 --> 01:23:13.005
- No, you don't understand. See...
- Great. It's all settled then.

01:23:13.747 --> 01:23:17.172
I've got my eye out for some rapid
advancement for you, Brantley.

01:23:17.251 --> 01:23:21.222
You seem to be a young man
with a lot on the ball. Keep it up.

01:23:25.384 --> 01:23:27.057
Schmuck.

01:23:30.556 --> 01:23:32.775
That's nice.

01:23:33.809 --> 01:23:38.155
Excuse me. Brantley, darling,
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

01:23:42.067 --> 01:23:45.412
I'm going to introduce you to the most
powerful money men in New York.

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:47.364
If you can do to them
what you've done to me...

01:23:47.448 --> 01:23:50.452
- I can't do that.
- I mean bowl them over, darling.

01:23:50.534 --> 01:23:53.629
You're irresistible
when you turn on that boyish charm.

01:23:53.704 --> 01:23:56.253
- Hi, Whitfield.
- Whitfield?

01:23:56.332 --> 01:23:58.334
Yeah, it's my middle name.
Brantley Whitfield...

01:23:58.417 --> 01:24:00.385
- Hi, Carlton.
- Carlton Foster.

01:24:00.461 --> 01:24:03.590
- You go by all those names?
- Yeah, I got a lot of 'em.

01:24:03.672 --> 01:24:07.518
My parents couldn't make up their mind.
My monogram looks like an eye chart.

01:24:08.093 --> 01:24:11.939
You're always surprising me, Brantley.
That's your most attractive quality.

01:24:12.973 --> 01:24:15.351
Promise me you'll never stop.

01:24:17.144 --> 01:24:19.897
- I promise.
- Good. Now.

01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:23.655
Roland Owens, First Federal.
Very rich. We start with him.

01:24:23.734 --> 01:24:26.487
He made his money
the really old-fashioned way.

01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:28.538
He inherited it.

01:24:28.614 --> 01:24:30.616
And see the man playing tennis
with the elbow brace...

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:32.326
the knee strap and the glove?

01:24:32.409 --> 01:24:35.583
Vernon S. Fletcher,
Wall Street's iron man.

01:24:35.662 --> 01:24:39.587
If he likes you, you can write
your own ticket, and he'll like you.

01:24:39.666 --> 01:24:41.668
Who's the tall guy
with all the girls?

01:24:41.752 --> 01:24:45.507
Good eye, Brantley. Harley
McMasters, First Multinational.

01:24:45.631 --> 01:24:50.478
Recently divorced. They're all dying to
be the second Mrs First Multinational.

01:24:50.969 --> 01:24:55.440
Listen, you're not gonna tell anybody
I work in the mailroom, are ya?

01:24:55.599 --> 01:24:57.317
Trust me, Brantley.

01:24:57.393 --> 01:24:59.612
I got Howard his key
to the executive washroom.

01:24:59.686 --> 01:25:01.688
I can do the same thing for you.

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.663
Here are Whitfield's notes.

01:25:12.324 --> 01:25:14.326
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

01:25:16.203 --> 01:25:19.628
This is supposed to be
a business trip, remember?

01:25:19.706 --> 01:25:22.676
Baby, how can I concentrate
on business?

01:25:23.335 --> 01:25:25.303
Howard, let me go!

01:25:34.596 --> 01:25:37.349
What are you doing here?

01:25:38.016 --> 01:25:40.860
Would Carlton Whitfield
miss a party?

01:25:40.936 --> 01:25:44.190
- I'm so glad you're here.
- So am I.

01:25:46.483 --> 01:25:47.860
Quick!

01:25:48.694 --> 01:25:50.412
Stop! Not here!

01:25:54.032 --> 01:25:56.126
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:59.125
Wait. I gotta tuck.
You go first. Go first.

01:25:59.204 --> 01:26:02.299
- How do I look?
- Come on. Come on.

01:26:02.374 --> 01:26:05.093
Well, I've had a look
at that preliminary report...

01:26:05.169 --> 01:26:08.673
and I'm satisfied that the proposed
cutbacks are our best line of defence.

01:26:08.797 --> 01:26:11.926
Thank you, sir. We have tried
to cut hard and to cut deep.

01:26:12.009 --> 01:26:16.389
- Yes. The job was adequately done.
- Thank you, sir.

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:19.191
I think Whitfield is right,
and this report is wrong.

01:28:04.037 --> 01:28:07.132
- Have you seen Christy?
- No, I haven't, sir. Not for a while.

01:28:10.127 --> 01:28:13.131
- Have you seen Christy?
- Sorry. No, I haven't.

01:28:15.674 --> 01:28:17.972
- Jack.
- Yes, Howard.

01:28:18.051 --> 01:28:19.803
Have you seen Christy Wills?

01:28:19.886 --> 01:28:21.854
She's talking to Whitfield.

01:28:26.351 --> 01:28:29.446
No? Come on.
That's my best... trust me.

01:28:29.521 --> 01:28:31.364
It's my best one.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.818
Would you excuse us
for a minute, Christy?

01:28:40.574 --> 01:28:43.248
Brantley, did you know
that Whitfield is here?

01:28:43.952 --> 01:28:46.250
Yeah, I think he was
here earlier, but he left.

01:28:46.330 --> 01:28:49.425
No. Somebody saw him
a few minutes ago talking to Christy.

01:28:51.877 --> 01:28:54.211
Now, I've got my reasons.

01:28:54.212 --> 01:28:56.214
I want you to stay
close to Christy...

01:28:56.298 --> 01:28:58.471
and keep Whitfield
away from her.

01:28:58.550 --> 01:29:01.053
Can you do that for me?

01:29:01.178 --> 01:29:03.180
Hey, I'm your man.

01:29:03.263 --> 01:29:06.608
Good. I knew
I could count on you.

01:29:12.397 --> 01:29:14.365
What was that all about?

01:29:14.441 --> 01:29:18.821
Well, he wants me to stay
as close to you as possible.

01:29:19.488 --> 01:29:21.786
- He told you that?
- Yeah.

01:29:23.075 --> 01:29:25.828
I don't know. I guess he thinks
we make a good couple.

01:30:10.288 --> 01:30:11.961
Are you awake?

01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:06.131
Darling?

01:33:48.965 --> 01:33:51.434
Sweetheart, it's Howard.

01:33:51.509 --> 01:33:55.059
- Go away!
- Let's make this a night to remember.

01:33:55.221 --> 01:33:58.316
Darling, I know
you're angry with me...

01:33:58.391 --> 01:34:02.237
but think of all the things
that we've meant to each other.

01:34:03.146 --> 01:34:06.025
I want to marry you, Christy.

01:34:14.032 --> 01:34:15.875
Don't be that way, baby.

01:34:23.041 --> 01:34:26.090
What do you say?
Will you marry me?

01:34:26.169 --> 01:34:28.672
No, but I'd like
to beat the shit outta you!

01:34:35.261 --> 01:34:37.059
Wait till I get my...

01:34:41.309 --> 01:34:42.777
Who is that?

01:34:43.895 --> 01:34:45.897
Oh, my God!

01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:48.192
Oh, my God!

01:34:48.274 --> 01:34:51.778
The sexual revolution is over.
Everybody, out of bed.

01:34:53.279 --> 01:34:55.828
What are you doing in
Christy's bed, Brantley?

01:34:55.907 --> 01:34:58.285
- I'm talking to you, Howard.
- Who's Brantley?

01:34:58.451 --> 01:35:02.251
Brantley is the guy who just found
his stolen notes in your bag.

01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:06.460
Those are Whitfield's notes, and they
are not stolen. He gave them to me.

01:35:06.543 --> 01:35:10.013
You were so grateful to him, you climbed
into bed and asked him to marry you.

01:35:10.088 --> 01:35:12.637
What are you talking about?
I climbed into bed with you.

01:35:12.757 --> 01:35:13.966
Baloney!

01:35:13.967 --> 01:35:15.890
You thought you were
climbing into bed with her.

01:35:15.969 --> 01:35:19.064
Wait. When I came in,
he was in bed with Whitfield.

01:35:19.139 --> 01:35:21.267
Whitfield?
He wasn't even here.

01:35:21.349 --> 01:35:23.818
- Are you blind? Who's that?
- That's Brantley.

01:35:24.978 --> 01:35:28.073
So this is the bimbo you've been
screwing around with at the office?

01:35:28.148 --> 01:35:31.446
- Who are you calling a bimbo?
- If the shoe fits...

01:35:31.447 --> 01:35:33.411
What's that supposed to mean?

01:35:33.486 --> 01:35:35.705
Why didn't you ask for those?
I would have given 'em to you.

01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:38.750
I was gonna tell you about that.
It happened before I really knew you.

01:35:38.825 --> 01:35:42.955
So when we were in bed, that whole
thing was James Bond time, right?

01:35:43.038 --> 01:35:46.383
- No!
- You went to bed with Brantley?

01:35:46.458 --> 01:35:50.304
Don't worry, Howard. She's probably got
microfilm pictures of the whole thing.

01:35:50.378 --> 01:35:52.346
What were you doing
in bed with my nephew?

01:35:52.422 --> 01:35:55.175
- Whitfield's your nephew?
- This is Brantley Foster.

01:35:55.258 --> 01:35:57.010
He works in the mailroom.

01:35:57.093 --> 01:35:59.562
The mailroom?
You mean you're not an executive?

01:35:59.679 --> 01:36:03.559
Let me get this straight.
Brantley is Whitfield?

01:36:03.641 --> 01:36:05.018
That's right.

01:36:05.101 --> 01:36:07.980
Brantley is Whitfield.
Whitfield is Brantley.

01:36:08.063 --> 01:36:09.531
And Christy is the bimbo.

01:36:09.689 --> 01:36:12.488
Well, now that we've had
Mouseketeer roll call...

01:36:12.567 --> 01:36:14.911
I'm just going to go
call my lawyer.

01:36:15.028 --> 01:36:18.496
Wait. Christy is not the bimbo I was
screwing around with at the office.

01:36:18.497 --> 01:36:20.288
People better stop
calling me "bimbo."

01:36:20.366 --> 01:36:22.084
It was an entirely
different bimbo.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.834
That's fine. How many
bimbos would you say there were?

01:36:24.996 --> 01:36:28.296
I misspoke myself.
There weren't any bimbos at all.

01:36:28.297 --> 01:36:30.760
- Except Christy.
- Right. No!

01:36:32.462 --> 01:36:35.807
The question is, how many people
did you sleep with to get to the top?

01:36:39.344 --> 01:36:42.061
That was a very expensive
vase, you bitch.

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:46.026
Shut up! Now listen. Whatever I did
was my business, not yours.

01:36:46.027 --> 01:36:48.691
No, you mean it was
company business.

01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:52.650
That's right, and that's
all it was: business.

01:36:57.862 --> 01:37:00.285
Let me tell you somethin',
sweetheart.

01:37:02.534 --> 01:37:04.753
You're very good at your job.

01:37:16.965 --> 01:37:19.844
You mean I was workin'
for a guy from the mailroom?

01:37:19.926 --> 01:37:23.100
- You're not an executive?
- He's too good to be an executive.

01:37:24.222 --> 01:37:26.190
- Disappointed?
- Yes!

01:37:26.266 --> 01:37:28.815
I was having fun on this job.

01:37:28.893 --> 01:37:32.989
You had all this energy,
and all these crazy ideas.

01:37:33.064 --> 01:37:35.158
And you kept takin'
your pants off.

01:37:35.233 --> 01:37:37.531
I don't want you to go.

01:37:38.736 --> 01:37:40.363
Here.

01:37:40.738 --> 01:37:43.036
Just a little somethin'
to remember me by.

01:37:43.825 --> 01:37:47.079
- Thank you.
- Brantley, why you lookin' so sad?

01:37:47.745 --> 01:37:50.498
I don't know. I just thought
it'd work out better, you know?

01:37:50.623 --> 01:37:52.250
The job or the girl?

01:37:53.376 --> 01:37:56.300
The job.
To hell with the girl.

01:37:56.921 --> 01:37:59.891
Yeah.
You sound real convincing.

01:38:00.758 --> 01:38:03.056
Well, look at it this way, pal.

01:38:04.179 --> 01:38:07.934
For a few weeks, you sat up here in
the lofty atmosphere of the big cheeses.

01:38:08.057 --> 01:38:11.857
You had a nice view of Manhattan
and a clean lunchroom to eat in.

01:38:11.936 --> 01:38:15.736
Hell, you did more in two months
than most people do in a lifetime.

01:38:16.733 --> 01:38:18.735
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.

01:38:19.777 --> 01:38:22.280
The job or the girl?

01:38:30.455 --> 01:38:33.459
- Goin' back to Kansas?
- No, I'm not goin' back to Kansas.

01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:35.259
I came to New York to succeed.

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:37.424
I hear there's an opening
in the mailroom.

01:38:37.503 --> 01:38:40.427
You should talk.
You're just as unemployed as I am.

01:38:40.506 --> 01:38:42.508
Not for long.
I have contacts all over town.

01:38:42.592 --> 01:38:45.719
- There's always another Prescott around.
- Low blow, Foster. Dirty pool.

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:48.018
- I call 'em like I see 'em.
- Yeah, you're perfect, right?

01:38:48.139 --> 01:38:50.813
- I never slept with the boss.
- No, you slept with the boss's wife.

01:38:50.892 --> 01:38:52.269
She seduced me.

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:54.236
He seduced me.
What's the difference?

01:38:54.312 --> 01:38:56.565
I couldn't help it.
You went willingly.

01:38:56.648 --> 01:38:59.527
- I see. You were tied up in chains.
- I'll tell you what the difference is.

01:38:59.609 --> 01:39:01.907
- I thought you were a nice guy.
- I am a nice guy!

01:39:01.986 --> 01:39:03.403
You're a rat!

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:05.281
You lied to me, deceived me,
then acted as judge and jury...

01:39:05.365 --> 01:39:07.038
in a situation you
knew nothing about.

01:39:07.116 --> 01:39:10.461
- I know you were spying on me.
- I wasn't spying on you!

01:39:10.536 --> 01:39:14.006
- And I won't be spying on you any more!
- No, you won't, 'cause if I see you...

01:39:22.632 --> 01:39:24.930
Sorry.
This car is full.

01:39:30.056 --> 01:39:32.650
- We could never pull that off.
- How do you know?

01:39:32.725 --> 01:39:35.444
I'm a kid from the mailroom who
moved into a top executive position.

01:39:35.561 --> 01:39:37.359
Are you gonna tell me
I can't pull it off?

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:39.031
But you didn't.

01:39:39.524 --> 01:39:43.028
I almost did.
We could pull this off.

01:39:45.363 --> 01:39:48.617
- I'm gonna need your help, both of you.
- Is it somethin' I could get fired for?

01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:50.909
- Absolutely.
- I like it.

01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:53.754
Jean, see if you can find Harley
McMasters' phone number.

01:39:53.871 --> 01:39:56.374
And get some food up here.
Chinese sound good to you?

01:39:57.625 --> 01:40:01.380
Mr Davenport, we realize you'll want
to move some of your own people...

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:05.217
into the medium control
positions here at Pemrose.

01:40:07.635 --> 01:40:08.932
Naturally.

01:40:09.887 --> 01:40:13.812
What we're concerned about, frankly,
is the upper management positions.

01:40:16.519 --> 01:40:19.944
- Most of 'em will have to go.
- Oh, no.

01:40:22.025 --> 01:40:23.572
I see.

01:40:25.653 --> 01:40:28.031
But a handful of 'em...

01:40:29.532 --> 01:40:31.455
who have been so helpful...

01:40:33.536 --> 01:40:35.755
like yourselves, of course...

01:40:36.581 --> 01:40:38.629
will be stayin'
as long as you like.

01:40:40.251 --> 01:40:42.219
Well, then I see nothing
to stand in the way...

01:40:42.295 --> 01:40:44.844
of the immediate merger
of our two companies.

01:40:44.922 --> 01:40:47.971
Is this the place? it is!
Hey, good. Sorry we're late.

01:40:48.051 --> 01:40:51.976
- Get them out of here.
- I'm sorry. This is a private meeting.

01:40:52.055 --> 01:40:55.605
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Hold these, will you? Thanks a lot.

01:40:58.353 --> 01:41:01.152
- Call building security.
- Howard, relax. Listen.

01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:03.324
On behalf of the personnel
in the mailroom...

01:41:03.399 --> 01:41:06.573
the girls in the secretarial pool,
the female executives here at Pemrose...

01:41:06.652 --> 01:41:08.654
we wanted to give our blessing
to this little merger.

01:41:08.738 --> 01:41:12.584
- Who in hell are these people?
- Is that Don? Donny!

01:41:12.658 --> 01:41:16.663
How ya doin'? You mind if I stand up?
I think better when I'm movin' around.

01:41:16.746 --> 01:41:18.544
Gotta tell you, Don...

01:41:18.623 --> 01:41:20.625
at first, the idea of this merger
made me as nervous...

01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:23.632
as a long-tailed cat
in a room full of rocking chairs.

01:41:23.711 --> 01:41:26.009
But then I realized
I was wrong.

01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:29.475
The combination of our products
and your distribution capabilities...

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:32.679
could vault Pemrose right
to the top of the market.

01:41:33.679 --> 01:41:35.807
So glad you approve...

01:41:36.224 --> 01:41:37.817
whoever you are.

01:41:37.892 --> 01:41:40.395
Now if you get the hell out of here,
we'll finish the job.

01:41:40.895 --> 01:41:42.772
I can't do that for you, Don.

01:41:43.648 --> 01:41:45.867
See, the problem here
is management.

01:41:46.859 --> 01:41:49.201
Things were bad enough
when Howard was running the company.

01:41:49.202 --> 01:41:53.496
- Now we got you to deal with too.
- Get them out of here, now.

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:56.828
He can't, Don. You see,
Brantley made arrangements...

01:41:56.911 --> 01:41:58.913
to buy five percent
of the stock...

01:41:58.996 --> 01:42:01.875
in your company, Davenport
Enterprises, this morning.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.423
- We're buying you out.
- What?

01:42:05.503 --> 01:42:07.301
Get in there!

01:42:08.256 --> 01:42:10.008
That's right!

01:42:10.675 --> 01:42:13.474
We've initiated a takeover
of Davenport Enterprises...

01:42:13.553 --> 01:42:16.352
in a proxy fight for the
Pemrose Corporation.

01:42:16.472 --> 01:42:20.227
- This way, Mr McMasters.
- Gentlemen, good afternoon.

01:42:20.309 --> 01:42:22.727
These are my
financial advisers.

01:42:22.728 --> 01:42:25.777
They agreed to lend me the money
to finance this takeover.

01:42:25.857 --> 01:42:28.531
Surely you're not going to invest
in some crackpot scheme...

01:42:28.651 --> 01:42:31.994
cooked up by a kid who used
to work in our mailroom.

01:42:31.995 --> 01:42:35.333
Not at first, Howie, but I
had an ace in the hole:

01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:38.624
a major stockholder in the company
with the clout and support I needed.

01:42:38.703 --> 01:42:40.797
Don, I want you to meet...

01:42:40.872 --> 01:42:43.921
the new chairperson
of the Pemrose Corporation...

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.253
and the daughter of the founder...

01:42:46.254 --> 01:42:48.095
Vera Prescott.

01:42:50.590 --> 01:42:53.434
Afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:42:53.509 --> 01:42:55.477
Brantley and I
are very old friends...

01:42:55.553 --> 01:42:58.682
and when he told me his wonderful
ideas for running the company...

01:42:58.764 --> 01:43:00.766
I knew he was
the man for the job.

01:43:00.850 --> 01:43:05.447
I think we all understand
your real motivation here, Vera.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.649
I admit I felt...

01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:12.654
some attraction towards
Brantley at the beginning...

01:43:12.737 --> 01:43:15.115
but as you've always
told me, Howard...

01:43:15.198 --> 01:43:16.950
love is love...

01:43:17.033 --> 01:43:19.252
but business is business.

01:43:19.827 --> 01:43:22.580
You've run Daddy's company
into the ground, Howard...

01:43:22.705 --> 01:43:26.005
and I believe these people here can
bring it back to where it belongs again.

01:43:26.918 --> 01:43:29.922
Now, up, Howard,
out of that chair.

01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:34.016
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not about to resign my position.

01:43:34.017 --> 01:43:37.888
You don't have to, Howard.
You're fired.

01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:39.597
What?

01:43:40.264 --> 01:43:42.642
- Vera, you can't!
- Yes, I can.

01:43:42.808 --> 01:43:44.810
You see, Mr Davenport...

01:43:44.894 --> 01:43:49.397
as of this afternoon,
I control 50.1% of the voting stock.

01:43:49.398 --> 01:43:51.617
You, too, Art.
You're history.

01:43:55.279 --> 01:43:58.909
Brantley, Christy,
Jean, Melrose.

01:44:08.042 --> 01:44:09.840
Gentlemen, just in time.

01:44:09.919 --> 01:44:12.718
Mr Prescott and his aide have
disrupted a very important meeting.

01:44:12.797 --> 01:44:14.891
Would you please escort them
out of the building?

01:44:14.966 --> 01:44:17.845
Vera! Why this open hostility?

01:44:17.927 --> 01:44:20.476
I don't understand.
How did you get so...

01:44:20.596 --> 01:44:22.690
Would you take charge of
the meeting now, Brantley?

01:44:22.765 --> 01:44:25.143
- What did I ever do to deserve this?
- Excuse me.

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:38.205
Feel free to do that
amongst yourselves if you want.

01:44:42.159 --> 01:44:45.504
- So have you been to Kansas?
- No. What's in Kansas?

01:44:45.621 --> 01:44:49.296
Well, I figured we'd take
the private Pemrose jet...

01:44:49.375 --> 01:44:51.503
drop in on the folks.

01:44:51.836 --> 01:44:53.838
They're gonna want to meet you.

01:44:57.383 --> 01:44:59.681
Why haven't I met you before?

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.058
Baby, you ain't been hangin'
out in the mailroom.

01:45:02.221 --> 01:45:04.974
The mailroom.
I like that sound.

01:45:12.273 --> 01:45:15.573
Charlie, we got that same problem
with elevator three again.

01:45:15.651 --> 01:45:17.824
I don't believe this.

01:45:18.613 --> 01:45:20.365
This elevator's stuck again.

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:26.814
- Where to, sir?
- The opera, Rattigan.

01:46:26.889 --> 01:46:29.392
Yes, sir.
