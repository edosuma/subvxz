WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:04.105
OLD FRIENDS FOUGHT.

00:04.105 --> 00:06.537
YOU KNEW THAT
JULIE WAS IN TROUBLE,

00:06.537 --> 00:08.779
AND YOU CHOSE
NOT TO COME TO ME.

00:08.779 --> 00:12.313
NEW LOVERS LIE.
 (gasps)

00:12.313 --> 00:15.046
WHERE DID YOU GET IT, BREE?
 SHE BOUGHT IT? I'M ASSUMING.

00:15.046 --> 00:20.291
UH, YES, AT THAT LITTLE ANTIQUE
STORE DOWN ON PEARL STREET.
 SORRY. WE SELL FURNITURE.

00:20.291 --> 00:22.123
SHE MUST HAVE GOTTEN IT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:22.123 --> 00:25.196
AND SUSPICION WAS BORN.
 DO YOU KNOW WHERE
KATHERINE WAS

00:25.196 --> 00:27.198
THE NIGHT
THAT JULIE WAS ATTACKED?

00:31.602 --> 00:35.806
(Mary Alice) JULIE MAYER
WAS HAVING TROUBLE SLEEPING.

00:35.806 --> 00:40.341
YOU SEE, EVERY TIME
SHE CLOSED HER EYES,

00:40.341 --> 00:43.474
SHE DREAMT OF HER NEIGHBOR.

00:43.474 --> 00:47.648
THEY MET WHEN
SHE CAME TO TUTOR HIS SON.

00:47.648 --> 00:51.782
LATER, A CHANCE ENCOUNTER
AT A CAFÃ©

00:51.782 --> 00:55.486
LED TO HOURS OF CONVERSATION.

00:55.486 --> 00:58.389
HE ASKED TO SEE HER AGAIN...

00:58.389 --> 01:02.062
AND AGAIN...

01:02.062 --> 01:05.366
AND AGAIN.

01:05.366 --> 01:09.170
AND THE NEXT THING JULIE KNEW,

01:09.170 --> 01:14.105
SHE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH A MARRIED MAN.

01:14.105 --> 01:18.109
BUT THEN, AFTER A CLOSE CALL,

01:18.109 --> 01:21.682
SHE CAME TO HER SENSES

01:21.682 --> 01:25.186
AND TOLD THE MAN IT WAS OVER.

01:27.218 --> 01:28.819
(rapping on door)

01:28.819 --> 01:31.862
UNFORTUNATELY FOR JULIE,

01:31.862 --> 01:35.826
SOME MEN
CAN'T TAKE "NO" FOR AN ANSWER.

01:35.826 --> 01:37.498
CAN I COME IN?

01:46.237 --> 01:48.239
(Nick) WHAT, THAT'S IT?
IT'S THAT SIMPLE TO YOU?

01:48.239 --> 01:51.242
(Julie) YOU HAVE TO LEAVE NOW.
 COME ON.
LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THIS.

01:51.242 --> 01:53.744
THERE IS NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT!
JUST GO!

01:53.744 --> 01:56.747
YES, THERE IS! JUST COME ON.
TALK TO ME! HUH?

02:00.351 --> 02:03.154
(gasps) LYNETTE. HI.

02:03.154 --> 02:04.495
WHAT'S UP?

02:04.495 --> 02:07.228
I'M JUST DROPPING OFF
THAT BAND CANDY

02:07.228 --> 02:09.560
YOUR MOM BOUGHT FROM PENNY.
EVERYTHING OKAY?

02:09.560 --> 02:11.232
YEAH., EVERYTHING'S FINE.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.864
UM...
MR. BOLEN WAS JUST LEAVING.

02:13.864 --> 02:15.166
RIGHT?

02:15.166 --> 02:18.138
YEAH, I GUESS I WAS.
HEY, LYNETTE.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.770
HEY, NICK.

02:23.414 --> 02:24.915
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

02:24.915 --> 02:27.218
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:27.218 --> 02:30.321
WELL, I DON'T MEAN TO PRY.
IT'S JUST...

02:30.321 --> 02:34.154
WHEN I WAS WALKING UP,
I HEARD YOU TWO ARGUING.

02:36.227 --> 02:38.929
HE'S THE GUY.

02:38.929 --> 02:40.691
THE GUY?

02:40.691 --> 02:43.864
THE GUY I WAS...
HAVING THE AFFAIR WITH.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.467
NO.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.638
NO!

02:47.638 --> 02:50.341
WHY DID YOU TELL ME THIS?!
 YOU ASKED.

02:50.341 --> 02:52.203
WHY NOT LIE?

02:52.203 --> 02:54.205
I'M LATE FOR WORK.
I WOULD'VE BOUGHT ANYTHING.

02:54.205 --> 02:56.547
LOOK, DON'T FREAK OUT.
IT'S OVER.

02:56.547 --> 02:58.649
NOT FOR ME.
NOW I HAVE TO TELL YOUR MOM!

02:58.649 --> 03:02.213
NO, YOU DON'T.
 SHE WAS PISSED WHEN I DIDN'T
TELL HER YOU MIGHT BE PREGNANT.

03:02.213 --> 03:05.486
IF I DON'T TELL HER ABOUT THIS,
I'M DEAD.
 COME ON, LYNETTE.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.187
I AM SERIOUS!

03:07.187 --> 03:10.591
SHE ALREADY SHOT KATHERINE.
NOW SHE'S GOT A TASTE FOR BLOOD.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.893
THERE'S NO REASON
TO TELL HER ANYTHING.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.796
I BROKE IT OFF WEEKS AGO.
 THEN WHY WAS HE HERE?

03:15.796 --> 03:17.968
HE WANTS ME
TO TAKE HIM BACK.

03:17.968 --> 03:20.571
THREATEN TO TELL HIS WIFE.

03:20.571 --> 03:22.873
HE DOESN'T CARE.
HE SAYS HE LOVES ME.

03:22.873 --> 03:26.307
OH, HONEY, YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH
TO KNOW THAT THAT'S A LIE.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.239
RIGHT?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.543
(sighs)

03:32.543 --> 03:35.215
I KEEP TRYING
TO GET OVER HIM,

03:35.215 --> 03:38.949
BUT THEN HE COMES OVER HERE
AND HE SAYS ALL THIS STUFF,

03:38.949 --> 03:40.991
AND I-I JUST GET
SO CONFUSED.

03:42.953 --> 03:44.625
LISTEN TO ME.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.557
I WILL HANDLE THIS.

03:46.557 --> 03:48.729
REALLY?

03:50.431 --> 03:53.233
AND YOU--YOU WON'T
TELL MY MOM?

03:55.706 --> 03:57.568
NO, I WON'T.

03:57.568 --> 03:59.370
(sighs)

03:59.370 --> 04:01.572
THANK YOU.

04:01.572 --> 04:04.244
THAT NIGHT,
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS,

04:04.244 --> 04:06.847
JULIE MAYER WOULD SLEEP WELL.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.479
UNFORTUNATELY,

04:08.479 --> 04:11.822
LYNETTE SCAVO WOULD NOT.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.765
"THE FAIRVIEW
HOMESCHOOLING WORKBOOK"

04:24.765 --> 04:28.969
WAS CREATED TO HELP PARENTS
TEACH THEIR CHILDREN.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.742
IT'S COLORFUL,

04:31.742 --> 04:34.004
VERY ENTERTAINING,

04:34.004 --> 04:36.807
A BIT CHALLENGING

04:36.807 --> 04:39.810
AND GUARANTEED
TO MAKE TEACHING FUN.

04:41.712 --> 04:44.885
PICK THAT UP, OR I WILL
KNOCK YOU INTO NEXT WEEK!

04:44.885 --> 04:46.557
I HATE FRACTIONS!

04:46.557 --> 04:49.059
I DON'T CARE!
YOU STILL HAVE TO LEARN THEM!

04:49.059 --> 04:51.061
WHY? FRACTIONS ARE BORING!

04:51.061 --> 04:52.663
OKAY. FINE.

04:52.663 --> 04:55.366
LET ME MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING
FOR YOU.

04:55.366 --> 04:57.998
SAY I TAKE MRS. DOOLITTLE--
YOU FAVORITE DOLL--

04:57.998 --> 05:01.932
AND I CHOP HER INTO THIRDS.
I BURY ONE THIRD IN THE YARD.

05:01.932 --> 05:04.475
I PUT ANOTHER THIRD
DOWN THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL.

05:04.475 --> 05:06.977
HOW MUCH OF MRS. DOOLITTLE
DO YOU HAVE LEFT?

05:06.977 --> 05:09.039
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HURT HER,
ARE YOU?

05:09.039 --> 05:11.442
IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU ANSWER
THE QUESTION!

05:11.442 --> 05:14.014
GABY! CAN I SEE YOU FOR A SEC?

05:20.791 --> 05:24.054
WHAT IS GOING ON?
 I'M TEACHING MATH.

05:24.054 --> 05:25.556
BY THREATENING HER TOYS?

05:25.556 --> 05:27.998
(sighs) WELL, MAYBE TEACHER'S
A LITTLE TIRED, OKAY?

05:27.998 --> 05:30.501
IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING
I HAVE TO DO AROUND HERE.

05:30.501 --> 05:33.504
I ALSO HAVE TO COOK AND CLEAN.
 OKAY, I HEAR YOU.

05:33.504 --> 05:36.737
IT ISN'T FAIR
THAT ALL THIS FALLS ON YOU.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.939
I'LL GET YOU SOME HELP.
 THANK YOU.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.643
WE'LL GET A HOUSEKEEPER.
 WHAT? NO, NO, NO,
I'D RATHER HAVE A TUTOR.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.115
YOU'D RATHER SCRUBS TOILETS
THAN TEACH YOUR DAUGHTER?

05:45.115 --> 05:47.117
WELL, AT LEAST THE TOILETS
WON'T TALK BACK.

05:47.117 --> 05:50.350
GABY, SHE JUST HAD TO LEAVE HER
SCHOOL AND ALL HER FRIENDS.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.352
AND NOW HER MOTHER'S
GONNA ABANDON HER

05:52.352 --> 05:54.885
AND LEAVE HER WITH SOME
STRANGER? I DON'T THINK SO.
 NO, BUT--

05:54.885 --> 05:57.628
NO "BUT"s. JUANITA NEEDS YOU
RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE DOING THIS.

05:57.628 --> 06:00.391
(sighs)

06:02.693 --> 06:05.466
DON'T WORRY.
YOUR DOLL'S SAFE.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.668
IF I'M GONNA
CHOP ANYTHING OFF,

06:07.668 --> 06:09.970
IT'S GONNA BE
SOMETHING OF YOUR DADDY'S!

06:09.970 --> 06:12.743
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU WON'T EVEN TALK TO HER?

06:12.743 --> 06:14.975
NO, WE ALREADY INTERVIEWED
MRS. MAYFAIR.

06:14.975 --> 06:18.008
THAT'S WHEN YOU THOUGHT
DANNY BOLEN HAD ATTACKED JULIE.

06:18.008 --> 06:20.010
YOU TREATED HER
LIKE A WITNESS.

06:20.010 --> 06:22.052
NOW YOU NEED TO TREAT HER
LIKE A SUSPECT.

06:22.052 --> 06:24.455
LOOK, MISS, WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO DISMISS YOUR CONCERNS,

06:24.455 --> 06:26.857
BUT WOMEN DON'T COMMIT
THIS KIND OF CRIME.

06:26.857 --> 06:28.859
THEY TEND TO KEEP
AT A PHYSICAL REMOVE

06:28.859 --> 06:30.591
FROM THEIR VICTIMS--

06:30.591 --> 06:32.993
VEHICULAR ASSAULTS, POISON.

06:32.993 --> 06:38.829
WELL, MAYBE KATHERINE
WAS THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX.

06:38.829 --> 06:41.572
HEY, DID YOU GET ANY MAYO?
 YEAH.

06:41.572 --> 06:43.103
(sighs)

06:43.103 --> 06:46.507
LOOK, I WAS SKEPTICAL, TOO,
BUT SHE DOES HAVE A MOTIVE.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.179
SHE HATES SUSAN.
 WELL, THAT'S A MOTIVE
TO ATTACK HER.

06:49.179 --> 06:53.083
WELL, MAYBE KATHERINE SAW JULIE
TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE

06:53.083 --> 06:55.085
AND THOUGHT IT WAS ME.

06:55.085 --> 06:57.748
SHE MISTOOK YOU
FOR A 23-YEAR-OLD?

06:57.748 --> 07:01.922
(laughing)

07:01.922 --> 07:04.124
I'M SORRY, MRS. DELFINO,
BUT, UH,

07:04.124 --> 07:06.627
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT
ACTUAL EVIDENCE,

07:06.627 --> 07:09.630
WE'RE GONNA KEEP ASSUMING
THAT THIS IS A RANDOM INCIDENT--

07:09.630 --> 07:12.132
ONE THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
THANKFULLY SURVIVED.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.964
DAMN IT! THEY FORGOT THE PICKLE!

07:13.964 --> 07:16.507
WHAT IS WITH THIS PLACE?

07:16.507 --> 07:18.509
IS THERE ANYONE HERE
THAT UNDERSTANDS

07:18.509 --> 07:20.771
A WOMAN CAN BE
A PSYCHO KILLER, TOO?

07:20.771 --> 07:24.815
AH, MAYBE I CAN HELP. HMM?
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THIS ONE?

07:24.815 --> 07:26.947
HAVE AT IT.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.649
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.151
SO HOW ABOUT I, UH,
TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR FILE?

07:31.151 --> 07:33.153
I WILL SWING BY TOMORROW,

07:33.153 --> 07:36.557
AND I'LL
GET YOUR STATEMENT THEN.
 GREAT.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.689
WELL...

07:38.689 --> 07:42.693
IT IS NICE TO KNOW THAT
SOMEONE CARES ABOUT JUSTICE

07:42.693 --> 07:45.135
MORE THAN PICKLES.

07:45.135 --> 07:48.969
COME ON, MIKE.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.072
(man) ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT THIS CASE?

07:52.072 --> 07:55.676
'CAUSE I'VE GOT A SERIAL KILLER
HERE THAT MIGHT BE MORE FUN.

07:55.676 --> 07:59.149
NAH, SHE AND I GO WAY BACK.

07:59.149 --> 08:00.981
MM-HMM.

08:00.981 --> 08:05.085
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER ME NOW,
BUT SHE WILL.

08:08.058 --> 08:10.561
I WISH YOU HADN'T
COMMITTED US TO THIS.

08:10.561 --> 08:12.022
WHY? THEY'RE OUR NEIGHBORS,

08:12.022 --> 08:14.024
AND THEY'VE BEEN ASKING US
FOR WEEKS.

08:14.024 --> 08:16.727
I'M NOT A FAN OF ANGIE BOLEN.
SHE CAN BE VERY FORWARD.

08:16.727 --> 08:19.199
I LIKE HER. SHE'S EARTHY,
TAKES A REAL INTEREST IN PEOPLE.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.932
YES. LAST WEEK, SHE ASKED ME
HOW MUCH MY DRESS COST

08:21.932 --> 08:24.905
AND DID I STILL GET VISITS
FROM MY AUNT FLO.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.877
WELL, I BELIEVE
THAT'S A EUPHEMISM FOR--

08:26.877 --> 08:30.010
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.511
BY THE WAY, I STOPPED BY
THAT ANTIQUE STORE TODAY--

08:32.511 --> 08:34.845
THE ONE WHERE YOU SAID
YOU BOUGHT THAT BROOCH.

08:34.845 --> 08:36.847
OH?
 YEAH, I THOUGHT
I'D GET YOU A REPLACEMENT

08:36.847 --> 08:38.849
SINCE YOU GAVE YOURS
TO SUSAN.

08:38.849 --> 08:41.150
BUT THE OWNER SAID
THEY DON'T SELL JEWELRY THERE.

08:41.150 --> 08:42.893
JUST FURNITURE.

08:42.893 --> 08:45.055
WELL, THAT'S ODD.
 (doorbell rings)

08:45.055 --> 08:47.057
I MUST'VE
CONFUSED THAT STORE

08:47.057 --> 08:49.059
WITH THE JEWELRY SHOP
ON MAPLE STREET.

08:49.059 --> 08:52.102
YES, I REMEMBER NOW.
THAT'S WHERE I BOUGHT IT.

08:52.102 --> 08:53.233
(door opens)

08:53.233 --> 08:55.866
(singsong voice)
HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE!

09:00.140 --> 09:03.213
MY GOODNESS.
ANOTHER COURSE?

09:03.213 --> 09:05.215
WELL, MY GRANDMA BOMBELLI
ALWAYS SAID,

09:05.215 --> 09:07.217
"IF THE MEN CAN STILL
BUTTON THEIR PANTS,

09:07.217 --> 09:08.949
DINNER AIN'T OVER YET."

09:08.949 --> 09:10.080
(chuckles)

09:12.022 --> 09:13.654
MMM.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.256
IS HER BRACIOLE AMAZING
OR WHAT?

09:16.256 --> 09:18.789
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I'VE NEVER HAD THIS BEFORE.

09:18.789 --> 09:20.761
AND IT IS QUITE TASTY.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.993
AW, THANKS, HON.
HANG ON A SEC.

09:22.993 --> 09:26.066
YOU DON'T WANT TO STAIN
THAT GORGEOUS BLOUSE.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.638
AHEM.

09:27.638 --> 09:30.741
I'M ACTUALLY
A VERY NEAT EATER.

09:30.741 --> 09:33.043
OH, HEY, WHEN NICK HERE
STARTS TWIRLIN' HIS PASTA,

09:33.043 --> 09:34.745
NOBODY'S SAFE. (chuckles)

09:34.745 --> 09:38.078
I DID GET SOME FRIENDLY FIRE
FROM A MEATBALL EARLIER.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.209
(all laugh)

09:39.209 --> 09:42.112
YEAH, I'M GLAD WE'RE
FINALLY DOING THIS.

09:42.112 --> 09:46.116
YOU TWO ARE HARD TO PIN DOWN.
 WELL, WE'VE BEEN
INCREDIBLY BUSY.

09:46.116 --> 09:48.118
OH, I'LL BET, ESPECIALLY SINCE
KATHERINE WIGGED OUT

09:48.118 --> 09:51.121
AND YOU HAD
TO GIVE HER THE BOOT. (laughs)
 YOU KNOW, IF YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO REPLACE HER,

09:51.121 --> 09:53.123
YOU COULD A LOT WORSE
THAN ANGIE.

09:53.123 --> 09:54.324
OH?

09:54.324 --> 09:56.026
YEAH, HER GRANDMA BOMBELLI

09:56.026 --> 09:58.198
HAD THE BEST RESTAURANT
IN LITTLE ITALY,

09:58.198 --> 10:00.000
TAUGHT ANGIE
EVERYTHING SHE KNEW.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.872
I MEAN...

10:01.872 --> 10:04.004
IF YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR HELP.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.236
WELL, IF YOUR FOOD
IS ALL THIS GOOD--

10:06.236 --> 10:09.980
WE'RE... NOT HIRING.

10:09.980 --> 10:11.812
SORRY.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.144
OKAY.
IT'S JUST A THOUGHT.

10:14.144 --> 10:16.616
YOU SURE, BREE?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.149
SHE SAID NO.

10:19.149 --> 10:22.152
NO, I'M JUST SAYIN'... YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSIN'.

10:22.152 --> 10:24.755
NICK, SHE'S HAD FOUR COURSES.
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S MISSING.

10:24.755 --> 10:28.028
NOW ZIP IT.
 DON'T BITE MY HEAD OFF.
I'M JUST TRYIN' TO HELP.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.060
WHAT, BY EMBARRASSING
OUR GUESTS?

10:33.934 --> 10:36.807
JUST IGNORE HIM, OKAY?

10:36.807 --> 10:39.670
IT WAS YOUR IDEA
TO COOK FOR HER.
 (utensil clatters)

10:39.670 --> 10:40.911
(sighs)

10:40.911 --> 10:43.273
THANK YOU!
NOW THEY'RE GONNA THINK

10:43.273 --> 10:46.276
THAT I DON'T COOK FOR PEOPLE
UNLESS I HAVE AN ANGLE.

10:46.276 --> 10:49.720
I AM SO SORRY.

10:53.223 --> 10:56.156
NOW LOOK AT THEM. THEY'RE
WISHIN' THEY HADN'T COME.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.159
NO! WE'RE HAVING A LOVELY TIME.
 NO! WE'RE THRILLED TO BE HERE!

10:59.159 --> 11:01.892
PERFECT! NOW YOU'RE
MAKIN' OUR GUESTS LIE.

11:01.892 --> 11:03.894
I'M GONNA GO STIR THE SAUCE.

11:06.897 --> 11:08.769
I'LL GET MORE WINE.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.771
(sighs) WE'RE GONNA NEED IT.

11:10.771 --> 11:14.374
UH, JUST CURIOUS,
HOW MANY MORE COURSES?

11:14.374 --> 11:17.047
(sighs) THREE.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.182
ORSON, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS TO YOU AGAIN,

11:22.182 --> 11:24.314
BUT PLEASE... (whispers)
UNBUTTON YOUR PANTS.

11:34.224 --> 11:35.766
(sighs) OKAY.

11:35.766 --> 11:37.768
IF YOU HAVE HALF A CABBAGE,

11:37.768 --> 11:39.770
AND SOMEONE GIVES YOU
A QUARTER CABBAGE,

11:39.770 --> 11:41.772
HOW MUCH CABBAGE
DO YOU HAVE?

11:41.772 --> 11:44.805
NONE, BECAUSE I HATE CABBAGES
AND I WOULDN'T TAKE 'EM.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.907
FINE. THEY'RE BALLOONS.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.709
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS HALF A BALLOON.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.842
WELL, THERE IS A SUCH THING
AS HALF AN ALLOWANCE,

11:51.842 --> 11:54.845
WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET
IF YOU DON'T START TO FOCUS.

11:54.845 --> 11:57.087
WHY CAN'T I JUST USE
A CALCULATOR?

11:57.087 --> 11:59.089
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO KNOW
THIS STUFF.

11:59.089 --> 12:01.391
IF NOT, YOU'RE GONNA END UP

12:01.391 --> 12:04.194
SCRUBBING
OTHER PEOPLE'S TOILETS!

12:04.194 --> 12:05.225
SORRY.

12:07.127 --> 12:10.400
LOOK, IF YOU FINISH THIS PAGE,
WE'LL GO GET SOME ICE CREAM.

12:10.400 --> 12:14.805
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
 I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE ICE CREAM WITH YOU.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.242
I'M GONNA GET SOME AIR.
(sighs)

12:22.242 --> 12:27.117
WILL YOU MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T
MOVE FROM THE TABLE?

12:29.319 --> 12:31.321
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS AGAIN?

12:31.321 --> 12:33.323
UH, FOIE GRAS MOUSSE.

12:33.323 --> 12:35.856
MMM. TASTES SO ELEGANT.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.888
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S ELEGANT?

12:37.888 --> 12:39.189
IT'S OKAY.

12:39.189 --> 12:42.532
WELD YOU LIKE TO SAMPLE
SOMETHING ELSE, MR. VITALE?

12:42.532 --> 12:45.966
SOME SALMON EN CROUTE
OR PERHAPS SOME COQ AU VIN?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.168
GOT ANYTHING
I CAN PRONOUNCE?

12:48.168 --> 12:50.200
(chuckles)
 YOU DON'T NEED
TO PRONOUNCE IT.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.502
YOU JUST GOTTA
WIPE IT OFF YOUR SHIRT.

12:52.502 --> 12:56.776
YOU WANNA END UP ON A PLATE
NEXT TO THE SALMON, KEEP IT UP.
 (sighs deeply)

12:56.776 --> 12:58.778
I-I'M SORRY
WE WASTED YOUR TIME.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.151
MY HUSBAND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
ELEGANT FOOD. HE'S AN IGNORAMUS.

13:01.151 --> 13:03.153
HEY, THIS IGNORAMUS IS
THROWING YOU

13:03.153 --> 13:05.785
AN ANNIVERSARY PARTY
FOR 500 PEOPLE.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.089
500, YOU SAY?

13:09.089 --> 13:12.262
LET'S, UM, SIT DOWN
AND FIGURE SOMETHING OUT

13:12.262 --> 13:14.925
BECAUSE I WOULD REALLY LOVE
TO CATER THIS PARTY.

13:14.925 --> 13:17.227
LOOK, YOU SEEM LIKE
A NICE LADY.

13:17.227 --> 13:20.230
IT'S JUST THAT OUR GUESTS
ARE COMIN' IN FROM THE BRONX.

13:20.230 --> 13:22.232
THEY DON'T KNOW FROM FANCY FOOD.

13:22.232 --> 13:26.276
IT'S MORE OF A SAUSAGE
AND PEPPERS CROWD. I'M SORRY.

13:26.276 --> 13:28.178
I COULD MAKE YOU BRACIOLE.

13:28.178 --> 13:30.140
YOU CAN DO BRACIOLE?

13:30.140 --> 13:32.312
YES, AND, UH...

13:32.312 --> 13:36.286
GNOCCHI AND TORTELLONI
AND, UH, LASAGNA VERDE.

13:36.286 --> 13:38.448
BUT NONE OF THAT STUFF'S
ON YOUR MENU.

13:38.448 --> 13:41.091
THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE FAMILY RECIPES

13:41.091 --> 13:43.523
FROM... (Italian accent)
MY GRANDMOTHER BOMBELLI.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.096
YOU'RE ITALIAN?
YOU DON'T LOOK IT.

13:46.096 --> 13:48.098
(normal voice)
PAPA WAS IRISH.

13:48.098 --> 13:50.330
I MAY GET MY HAIR
FROM THE O'ROURKE SIDE,

13:50.330 --> 13:52.202
BUT MY STOMACH...

13:52.202 --> 13:53.864
(Italian accent)
SHE'S ALL BOMBELLI.

13:53.864 --> 13:55.866
IF YOU GIVE ME THIS JOB,

13:55.866 --> 13:57.868
I WILL FEED YOUR FAMILY
MY STRACOTTO

13:57.868 --> 14:00.240
TILL THE MEN
CAN'T BUTTON THEIR PANTS.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.243
NOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
LOOKIN' FOR. YOU'RE HIRED.

14:05.015 --> 14:07.517
AHH! I FEEL BETTER.

14:07.517 --> 14:09.519
(closes door)

14:09.519 --> 14:13.123
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET BACK TO IT.

14:13.123 --> 14:16.026
(sighs)

14:16.026 --> 14:19.289
HOLD IT. YOU GOT
ALL THESE PROBLEMS RIGHT?

14:19.289 --> 14:22.262
(scoffs) YOU CHEATED,
DIDN'T YOU? CONFESS!

14:22.262 --> 14:24.434
NO, IVANA HELPED ME.

14:24.434 --> 14:28.138
WHO'S IVANA?
 (Eastern European accent)
THAT'S ME.

14:28.138 --> 14:31.071
WE MET WHEN YOU HANDED ME
THIS BUCKET AND RAG.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.472
OH. YEAH. RIGHT.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.275
SORRY. UH, YOU HELPED HER?

14:35.275 --> 14:40.150
I TOLD HER TO LOOK AT FRACTIONS
LIKE A BIG CHOCOLATE CAKE.

14:40.150 --> 14:42.512
THE BOTTOM NUMBER
IS THE WHOLE THING,

14:42.512 --> 14:45.515
AND THE TOP NUMBER REPRESENTS
HOW MANY SLICES.
 WELL, I SHOULD'VE KNOWN

14:45.515 --> 14:47.517
CAKE WOULD MAKE EVERYTHING
COME INTO FOCUS.

14:47.517 --> 14:49.189
MATH IS MY SPECIALTY.

14:49.189 --> 14:52.562
I HAVE A PhD IN ENGINEERING FROM
THE UNIVERSITY OF BUCHAREST.

14:52.562 --> 14:57.127
BUT IT MEANS NOTHING IN
THE AMERICAN JOB MARKET. SO...

14:57.127 --> 14:59.129
WOW. A DOCTOR.

14:59.129 --> 15:00.270
IMPRESSIVE.

15:00.270 --> 15:02.272
OH, THE UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

15:02.272 --> 15:04.334
HAS A BUNCH OF HAIR
STUCK IN THE DRAIN.

15:04.334 --> 15:06.336
CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT?

15:06.336 --> 15:07.677
SURE.

15:07.677 --> 15:09.209
(sighs)

15:09.209 --> 15:13.183
MOM, THIS NEXT PAGE DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE. I NEED HELP.

15:15.185 --> 15:17.317
UH... DOCTOR?

15:17.317 --> 15:19.289
(chuckles nervously)

15:19.289 --> 15:21.151
I'M THINKING
THAT DRAIN CAN WAIT.

15:27.557 --> 15:29.329
NICK--

15:29.329 --> 15:31.331
HEY, LYNETTE!
PERFECT TIMING.

15:31.331 --> 15:34.434
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
BUSTING OPEN A BOTTLE OF WINE.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.566
(chuckles) WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'M HERE TO TALK TO NICK.

15:36.566 --> 15:38.308
I WAS ADMIRING YOUR ROSES,

15:38.308 --> 15:41.111
AND I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
GIVE ME A FEW POINTERS.

15:41.111 --> 15:44.614
HONEY, YOU HEAR THAT? PEOPLE ARE
ASKING US FOR GARDENING TIPS.

15:44.614 --> 15:46.276
WE ARE OFFICIALLY SUBURBAN.

15:46.276 --> 15:47.417
(laughs)

15:47.417 --> 15:50.220
(laughs) OH, SO... WINE?

15:50.220 --> 15:51.982
UH... YOU GO AHEAD.

15:51.982 --> 15:53.323
ALL RIGHT.

15:53.323 --> 15:55.085
THANKS, THOUGH.
 MM-HMM.

15:55.085 --> 15:56.556
SO HERE'S THE KEY...
 (door opens)

15:56.556 --> 15:59.129
YOU, UH, YOU CUT
GOING AWAY FROM THE BUD

15:59.129 --> 16:01.961
AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE--
 I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND JULIE.

16:04.234 --> 16:07.297
FOR GOD SAKES,
YOU'RE TWICE HER AGE.

16:07.297 --> 16:11.341
OKAY, LYNETTE, THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS. NO OFFENSE.

16:11.341 --> 16:13.003
NONE TAKEN.

16:13.003 --> 16:15.675
BUT YOU KNOW WHO MIGHT
BE OFFENDED? HER FATHER.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.178
IF KARL FINDS OUT,
HE'S GONNA COME OVER HERE

16:18.178 --> 16:21.181
AND CUT YOUR BUDS OFF
AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.354
YEAH, THANKS FOR THE WARNING.
 I MEAN IT.

16:24.354 --> 16:26.756
IF YOU DON'T STOP BOTHERING
JULIE, YOU WILL BE SORRY.

16:26.756 --> 16:29.589
HAPPY GARDENING.
 WAIT, HANG ON A SECOND.
HANG ON. HANG...

16:29.589 --> 16:31.591
WAIT, JULIE SAID
I WAS BOTHERING HER?

16:31.591 --> 16:34.324
DID SHE ALSO TELL YOU THAT
SHE STARTED THIS WHOLE THING?

16:34.324 --> 16:36.196
SHE CAME AFTER ME.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.429
ALL RIGHT, THERE ARE
TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY.

16:39.429 --> 16:42.602
YEAH, WELL,
YOUR SIDE IS MARRIED.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.135
LOOK, I TRIED TO RESIST.

16:45.135 --> 16:47.177
(sighs)
SHE JUST WORE ME DOWN,

16:47.177 --> 16:49.179
TALKING ABOUT HOW SHE'D
NEVER MET ANYBODY LIKE ME,

16:49.179 --> 16:51.311
SHE NEVER FELT
THIS WAY BEFORE.

16:51.311 --> 16:55.345
SHE'S BEEN JERKING ME AROUND
SINCE THE DAY WE MET.
 I DON'T CARE!
JUST LEAVE HER ALONE.

16:55.345 --> 16:57.347
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

16:57.347 --> 16:59.349
HEY, HEY.
 (gasps)

16:59.349 --> 17:01.651
IF I FIND OUT
YOU TOLD ANYONE ABOUT US,

17:01.651 --> 17:05.095
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S GONNA BE SORRY.

17:05.095 --> 17:06.396
SO LIKE I SAID,

17:06.396 --> 17:09.199
YOU WANNA WATER THE ROSES,
YOU KNOW, A FEW TIMES A WEEK.

17:09.199 --> 17:11.201
DON'T GET ANYTHING
ON THE FOLIAGE.

17:11.201 --> 17:13.262
THAT'S HOW THEY GET DISEASED.
ALL RIGHT?

17:13.262 --> 17:15.635
HEY, THANKS, BABY.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.467
MWAH.

17:26.675 --> 17:28.518
YOU OKAY?

17:32.352 --> 17:35.185
I THINK I MIGHT KNOW
WHO STRANGLED JULIE.

17:47.337 --> 17:49.469
(dishes clattering)

17:51.541 --> 17:54.504
HEY, GOOD TIMING.
I'M PUTTING DINNER ON THE TABLE.

17:54.504 --> 17:57.377
I THOUGHT THE HOUSEKEEPER
WAS SUPPOSED TO START TODAY.

17:57.377 --> 18:01.581
SHE DID,
AND SHE'S FANTASTIC!

18:03.353 --> 18:05.355
AND HER FAMILY
ESCAPED FROM ROMANIA

18:05.355 --> 18:06.816
WITH PRACTICALLY NOTHING.

18:06.816 --> 18:09.519
WELL, WHAT WERE THEY
FLEEING FROM, CLEANLINESS?

18:09.519 --> 18:12.762
WELL, I-I DIDN'T WANNA JUST
THROW WORK AT HER THE FIRST DAY.

18:12.762 --> 18:14.764
WE NEEDED TIME TO BOND.

18:14.764 --> 18:18.368
OKAY, SO WHEN DOES SHE START
BONDING WITH THE DISHWASHER?

18:18.368 --> 18:21.201
DADDY, LOOK WHAT I DID!
FRACTIONS!

18:21.201 --> 18:22.732
ALL RIGHT!

18:22.732 --> 18:25.805
SO MOMMY TAUGHT YOU HOW
TO DO FRACTIONS. (chuckles)

18:25.805 --> 18:27.477
MOMMY DIDN'T. IVANA--

18:27.477 --> 18:30.640
IVANA TAKE ALL THE CREDIT
MYSELF! (laughs)

18:30.640 --> 18:34.244
CAN YOU BELIEVE HER? AFTER ALL
THE WORK I'VE DONE...

18:34.244 --> 18:36.746
LET'S GO TEACH YOU
SOME MANNERS.

18:39.849 --> 18:41.851
SO THE BEST I CAN FIGURE,

18:41.851 --> 18:44.454
THE ATTACK HAPPENED
AROUND 11:30 THAT NIGHT.

18:44.454 --> 18:49.399
NOW PEOPLE SAW KATHERINE LEAVING
THE WEDDING IN THE AFTERNOON,

18:49.399 --> 18:52.402
AND NO ONE SAW HER AGAIN
UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING.

18:52.402 --> 18:55.305
SO... YOU HAVE TO WONDER.

18:57.367 --> 19:01.541
UM, I'M SORRY, BUT AREN'T YOU
GONNA WRITE SOME OF THIS DOWN?

19:01.541 --> 19:03.813
YOU TOTALLY DON'T REMEMBER ME,
DO YOU?

19:03.813 --> 19:07.277
OH, MY GOSH!

19:07.277 --> 19:10.350
NO. SORRY.
UH, CAN I GET A LITTLE HELP?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.851
DENISE.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.454
DENISE LAPERA.

19:16.226 --> 19:18.288
OF COURSE!

19:18.288 --> 19:19.359
(chuckles)

19:19.359 --> 19:21.791
A LITTLE MORE HELP, PLEASE?

19:21.791 --> 19:23.293
FAIRVIEW HIGH.

19:23.293 --> 19:26.796
I USED TO SIT BEHIND YOU
IN MR. PARSONS' ENGLISH CLASS.

19:26.796 --> 19:30.240
OH, MY GOD!
I AM SUCH AN IDIOT!

19:30.240 --> 19:32.242
DENISE LAPEERA!

19:32.242 --> 19:33.373
LAPERA.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.245
LAPERA. (chuckles)

19:35.245 --> 19:36.376
OH!

19:36.376 --> 19:38.578
WHOA! WOW!

19:38.578 --> 19:41.281
MR. PARSONS. (laughs)

19:41.281 --> 19:42.912
"PIT-STAIN" PARSONS.

19:42.912 --> 19:45.415
OH, GOSH. I WONDER
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO HIM.

19:45.415 --> 19:48.258
YEAH, I ACTUALLY ARRESTED HIM
A FEW YEARS BACK.

19:48.258 --> 19:50.720
TWICE. DRUNK DRIVING.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.664
HE GOT A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE.
I HAD TO USE MY TASER.

19:54.664 --> 19:58.328
PART OF MY WAS LIKE,
"ZIP! AND THAT'S FOR 'BEOWULF'!"

19:58.328 --> 20:01.231
(laughs)

20:01.231 --> 20:02.702
THAT'S GOOD TIMES.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.534
OH, GOOD TIMES.

20:04.534 --> 20:08.278
AND THE GOOD TIMES JUST KEEP
ROLLING FOR YOU, HUH, SUSAN?

20:08.278 --> 20:10.810
I MEAN, LOOK,
YOU GOT A HANDSOME HUSBAND

20:10.810 --> 20:13.383
AND TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN

20:13.383 --> 20:14.914
AND A LOVELY HOME.

20:14.914 --> 20:19.389
OH. WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU,
 DETECTIVE LAPEERA?

20:19.389 --> 20:21.491
LAPERA.
 LAPERA.

20:21.491 --> 20:25.755
UH, I, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
DONE VERY WELL FOR YOURSELF.

20:25.755 --> 20:28.398
PROFESSIONALLY, MAYBE.

20:28.398 --> 20:31.801
BUT I'M LIVING
IN MY MOTHER'S BASEMENT.

20:31.801 --> 20:34.534
OH.

20:34.534 --> 20:35.935
I'M SORRY.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.337
UH, DIVORCED?

20:37.337 --> 20:38.808
NEVER MARRIED.

20:38.808 --> 20:41.271
DATING ANYONE?

20:41.271 --> 20:45.445
NO, BUT I DID BOWL A 179
THE OTHER NIGHT.

20:47.317 --> 20:50.350
AND YOU'RE A DETECTIVE.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.582
(chuckles)

20:52.582 --> 20:54.253
SO BACK TO KATHERINE.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.255
UH, IS THERE, YOU KNOW,
ANYTHING ELSE

20:56.255 --> 20:59.258
THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO KNOW?
 NO, I'M GOOD.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.460
(sighs)

21:00.460 --> 21:02.962
I'LL JUST HEAD OVER THERE NOW
AND NOSE AROUND

21:02.962 --> 21:05.365
AND SEE IF SHE HAS AN ALIBI.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.937
OH, ACTUALLY, UH, DENISE,
ONE MORE THING.

21:07.937 --> 21:11.401
UM, THIS IS
A VERY TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY,

21:11.401 --> 21:14.374
AND I'M AFRAID IF KATHERINE
FINDS OUT THAT I'M THE ONE

21:14.374 --> 21:16.846
THAT ACCUSED HER OF THIS,
THINGS COULD GET UGLY.

21:16.846 --> 21:19.509
AW, WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT,
WOULD WE?

21:19.509 --> 21:21.981
EXACTLY,
SO MAYBE YOU COULD JUST SAY

21:21.981 --> 21:24.414
IT WAS AN ANONYMOUS TIP
OR SOMETHING.

21:24.414 --> 21:26.356
SURE.

21:26.356 --> 21:27.587
THANKS.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.420
OH, SAY HI TO YOUR MOM.
 YEAH, WE DON'T SPEAK.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.362
(door closes)

21:32.362 --> 21:34.364
OH, LOOK.
WHAT A NICE GIFT.

21:34.364 --> 21:36.866
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO
TO THANK YOU

21:36.866 --> 21:39.068
FOR THAT MARVELOUS DINNER.

21:39.068 --> 21:42.071
OH, PLEASE, WE SHOULD BE
THANKING YOU FOR NOT WALKING OUT

21:42.071 --> 21:45.074
WHEN ME AND NICK STARTED
SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER.
 OH, IT WAS JUST ONE COURSE.

21:45.074 --> 21:47.507
THE REST OF THE MEAL
WAS EXTREMELY QUIET.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.509
GOD, YOU ARE SO TACTFUL.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.342
YOU THINK YOU CAN TEACH ME
SOME OF THAT?

21:52.342 --> 21:55.585
AND TAKE AWAY THAT EARTHY CHARM?
I WOULDN'T THINK OF IT.

21:55.585 --> 21:57.517
(chuckles)

21:57.517 --> 21:59.519
LISTEN, ANGIE,
I HAVE THIS FRIEND

21:59.519 --> 22:02.021
COMING TO TOWN NEXT WEEK,
AND I WOULD LOVE

22:02.021 --> 22:04.524
TO SERVE HER THAT DINNER
YOU MADE FOR US,

22:04.524 --> 22:06.656
IF YOU DON'T MIND
SHARING YOUR RECIPES.

22:06.656 --> 22:09.659
OH, GEE, I WOULD LOVE TO HELP,
BUT GRANDMA BOMBELLI

22:09.659 --> 22:12.432
WAS REAL STRICT ABOUT NOT
SHARING THE FAMILY RECIPES.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.405
OH.

22:15.405 --> 22:17.367
PLEASE?

22:17.367 --> 22:20.610
THIS FRIEND JUST LOVES
GOOD ITALIAN FOOD.

22:20.610 --> 22:22.912
TAKE HER TO PICCOLINO.
THEIR FOOD IS GOOD.

22:22.912 --> 22:25.875
UM... THIS FRIEND--

22:25.875 --> 22:28.418
SHE DOESN'T REALLY GO
TO RESTAURANTS ANYMORE,

22:28.418 --> 22:31.350
NOT SINCE THE FIRE.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.122
PEOPLE STARE, SO...

22:33.122 --> 22:36.355
OH, MY GOD. THAT'S AWFUL.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:36.355 --> 22:40.089
GRANDMA WOULD WANT THIS WOMAN
TO EAT WELL. HOLD ON.

22:42.462 --> 22:45.595
OKAY, WE GOT THE GNOCCHI,
LASAGNA VERDE,

22:45.595 --> 22:49.098
THE TORTELLONI, THE BRACIOLE,
THE STRACOTTO, ARANCINI

22:49.098 --> 22:52.502
AND THE POLENTA CAKE.

22:52.502 --> 22:56.446
BUT... I'M MAKING
A BIG EXCEPTION HERE,

22:56.446 --> 22:58.748
SO PROMISE YOU WON'T GO
PASSING THESE AROUND.

22:58.748 --> 23:00.109
TRUST ME.

23:00.109 --> 23:04.854
I WILL TREAT THESE RECIPES
AS IF THEY WERE MY OWN.

23:04.854 --> 23:09.158
(sighs) SHE HAS BEEN OVER THERE
A LONG TIME, HASN'T SHE?

23:09.158 --> 23:12.922
MAN, ARE THERE ENOUGH PHOTOS
OF YOU IN THIS YEARBOOK?

23:12.922 --> 23:16.996
WOW. DO YOU STILL HAVE
THIS CHEERLEADING OUTFIT?

23:16.996 --> 23:18.097
MIKE!

23:18.097 --> 23:20.099
I JUST THOUGHT
IF YOU PUT IT ON,

23:20.099 --> 23:22.532
IT MIGHT JOG YOUR MEMORY.

23:23.773 --> 23:26.105
ALL RIGHT.

23:26.105 --> 23:29.479
LOOKING AT DENISE'S PHOTO
MIGHT DO THE TRICK.

23:29.479 --> 23:31.641
HEY, HERE SHE IS. YIKES.

23:31.641 --> 23:34.444
HAIR IN THE '80s--
WHAT WERE YOU GIRLS THINKING?

23:34.444 --> 23:35.885
OH, MY GOD. MOOSE.

23:35.885 --> 23:37.747
TOO MUCH MOUSSE,
IF YOU ASK ME.

23:37.747 --> 23:41.591
NO, THE ANIMAL.
THAT WAS HER NICKNAME.

23:41.591 --> 23:44.193
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

23:44.193 --> 23:46.425
WHAT'S WRONG?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.858
THIS IS MOOSE LAPERA.

23:48.858 --> 23:52.161
SHE WAS THE ONLY GIRL
THAT HATED ME IN HIGH SCHOOL.

23:52.161 --> 23:53.463
WHY?

23:53.463 --> 23:55.465
I MAY HAVE MENTIONED
TO BETH PORTER

23:55.465 --> 23:58.668
THAT... SHE HAD A LAUGH
LIKE A MOOSE.

23:58.668 --> 24:00.770
YOU GAVE HER THE NICKNAME?

24:00.770 --> 24:02.772
NO, I JUST MADE
THAT COMPARISON.

24:02.772 --> 24:05.575
BETH IS THE ONE THAT GOT
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL TO GO...

24:05.575 --> 24:07.577
(imitates moose braying)

24:07.577 --> 24:09.519
WHENEVER SHE WALKED BY.

24:09.519 --> 24:12.151
AND SHE HATES YOU
 BECAUSE OF THAT?

24:12.151 --> 24:17.026
WELL, AND ALSO... (sighs)
I KINDA STOLE HER BOYFRIEND.

24:17.026 --> 24:18.588
"KIND OF"?

24:18.588 --> 24:22.962
SHE SPENT ALL SENIOR YEAR
IN LOVE WITH MARK MALONE,

24:22.962 --> 24:24.964
AND THEY WENT
ON, LIKE, ONE DATE,

24:24.964 --> 24:27.867
AND MARK NOTICED ME
AND DUMPED MOOSE

24:27.867 --> 24:29.238
TO ASK ME OUT.

24:29.238 --> 24:32.642
SO THE GUY CAME AFTER YOU.
 WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

24:32.642 --> 24:35.144
CLEARLY YOU WERE NEVER
A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL.

24:35.144 --> 24:37.677
MOOSE WAS CONVINCED
THAT I STOLE MARK FROM HER,

24:37.677 --> 24:40.179
JUST LIKE KATHERINE IS
CONVINCED THAT I--OH, MY GOD!

24:40.179 --> 24:42.181
I SENT HER OVER THERE.

24:42.181 --> 24:45.655
IT'S LIKE A MEETING
OF THE "I HATE SUSAN" CLUB!

24:45.655 --> 24:47.957
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

24:47.957 --> 24:50.620
THIS WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

24:50.620 --> 24:52.962
NOBODY HOLDS A GRUDGE
THAT LONG.

24:52.962 --> 24:54.263
(door closes in distance)
 (sighs)

24:56.195 --> 24:59.128
HEY, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
LOOK AT THIS.

24:59.128 --> 25:04.003
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE
ARRESTING KATHERINE RIGHT NOW.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.535
(speaking inaudibly)

25:05.535 --> 25:07.537
THAT IS A PERP WALK.

25:07.537 --> 25:09.939
SHE IS TAKING KATHERINE
ON A PERP WALK.

25:09.939 --> 25:12.211
(Susan sighs)

25:13.783 --> 25:18.017
LOOKS MORE LIKE
A PERP HUG.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.620
WHAT IS GOING ON? WHAT--
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

25:22.251 --> 25:24.253
I THINK SHE'S SHOWING US

25:24.253 --> 25:26.756
HOW LONG SOMEONE
CAN HOLD A GRUDGE.

25:36.706 --> 25:39.208
JUANITA, I WAS THINKING,

25:39.208 --> 25:41.911
AFTER YOU AND IVANA
FINISH YOUR SCHOOLWORK,

25:41.911 --> 25:44.914
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO SEE
A MOVIE WITH ME--

25:44.914 --> 25:48.277
JUST THE TWO OF US?
 COOL! CAN WE HAVE
JUNIOR MINTS FOR DINNER?

25:48.277 --> 25:51.280
WOULDN'T BE A MOVIE IF
YOU WEREN'T THROWING UP CANDY

25:51.280 --> 25:53.723
ON THE RIDE HOME.

25:53.723 --> 25:56.586
(doorbell rings)

25:56.586 --> 26:00.289
HI. CAN I HELP YOU?

26:00.289 --> 26:02.091
HOLA. I'M CHRISTINA.

26:03.863 --> 26:06.636
FROM HAPPY HOUSEKEEPER?

26:06.636 --> 26:09.939
OH! OH, THERE MUST BE
SOME MISTAKE.

26:09.939 --> 26:12.571
UH, OUR MAID IS IVANA.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.174
I REQUEST IVANA.
(loudly) WHERE'S IVANA?

26:15.174 --> 26:17.106
MY ENGLISH NOT SO GOOD.

26:17.106 --> 26:19.108
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OUR NEW CLEANING LADY.

26:19.108 --> 26:21.881
GRACIAS POR VENIR.

26:21.881 --> 26:25.584
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
ONE MOMENT? UN MOMENTO.

26:27.216 --> 26:29.218
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
NEW CLEANING LADY?

26:29.218 --> 26:30.359
WHERE'S IVANA?

26:30.359 --> 26:33.763
I CALLED THE AGENCY AND HAD THEM
SEND OVER SOMEONE ELSE.

26:33.763 --> 26:35.995
WELL... (scoffs)
WHY?

26:35.995 --> 26:37.326
BECAUSE IVANA SUCKED,

26:37.326 --> 26:39.769
AND NOT IN THAT
GOOD VACUUM SORT OF WAY.

26:39.769 --> 26:42.271
HEY, CUT HER SOME SLACK.
SHE'S ROMANIAN.

26:42.271 --> 26:44.774
OKAY, WHEN YOUR PEOPLE ARE
BEING CHASED INTO ARGENTINA

26:44.774 --> 26:46.275
BY ANGRY COSSACKS,

26:46.275 --> 26:50.039
MAYBE A SPARKLING TOILET
ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT.
 ARGENTINA?

26:50.039 --> 26:52.041
HOW ABOUT YOU STICK
TO FRACTIONS,

26:52.041 --> 26:54.243
AND I'LL TEACH JUANITA
GEOGRAPHY?

26:54.243 --> 26:55.314
(whispers) GOODBYE.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.246
(normal voice) GRACIAS.

27:00.890 --> 27:04.393
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
TEACHING MATH TO 7-YEAR-OLDS?

27:04.393 --> 27:06.055
MY ENGLISH...

27:06.055 --> 27:07.356
(both) NOT SO GOOD.

27:07.356 --> 27:09.058
YEAH, I KNOW.

27:09.058 --> 27:11.731
(humming)

27:11.731 --> 27:13.963
(door opens)

27:13.963 --> 27:16.065
(singsong voice)
KNOCK, KNOCK!
 (knock on door)

27:16.065 --> 27:19.368
(door closes)
 ANGIE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

27:19.368 --> 27:21.370
OH, YOUR SHORTBREAD
WAS SO GOOD,

27:21.370 --> 27:23.873
I MADE YOU A BATCH
OF MY PIGNOLI COOKIES.

27:23.873 --> 27:25.875
HOW INCREDIBLY THOUGHTFUL
OF YOU.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.877
(sniffs)
HEY, I SMELL MARINARA.

27:27.877 --> 27:29.879
YOU COOKING MY FOOD
FOR YOUR FRIEND?

27:29.879 --> 27:31.881
YES, AND I AM WAY BEHIND,
SO--

27:31.881 --> 27:34.353
OH! WELL, LET ME HELP YOU, THEN!
WOW.

27:34.353 --> 27:37.687
YOU SURE GOT
A LOT OF SAUCE HERE.

27:37.687 --> 27:40.690
LOT OF POTATOES, TOO.

27:46.335 --> 27:49.368
THIS IS ALL
FOR THREE PEOPLE?

27:49.368 --> 27:52.972
WELL, WITH FOOD LIKE YOURS,
WHO WOULDN'T WANT LEFTOVERS?

27:56.746 --> 28:03.212
"VITALE ANNIVERSARY PARTY--
ARANCINO, GNOCCHI, BRACIOLE."

28:03.212 --> 28:05.955
YOU WERE STEALING MY RECIPES
FOR A CATERING JOB.

28:05.955 --> 28:09.288
I WANTED TO SERVE FOIE GRAS.
THE CLIENT DEMANDED PASTA.

28:09.288 --> 28:12.291
SO YOU COME RUNNING TO ME
WITH SOME SOB STORY

28:12.291 --> 28:15.464
ABOUT A BURN VICTIM WHO CAN
ONLY BE HEALED BY MANICOTT'?
 I ADMIT THAT WAS A BIT TACKY.

28:15.464 --> 28:18.297
I LIT A CANDLE
FOR THAT WOMAN!

28:18.297 --> 28:21.300
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
IT WAS A HUGE COMPLIMENT.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.302
(scoffs)
AND THE COMPLIMENT IS

28:23.302 --> 28:26.836
THAT MY FOOD IS GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOUR BUSINESS, BUT I'M NOT.

28:26.836 --> 28:29.138
I WOULD NEVER SAY
YOU WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

28:29.138 --> 28:31.140
OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T.
YOU'RE TACTFUL.

28:31.140 --> 28:34.143
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT,
WHICH IS WHY I CAN SAY

28:34.143 --> 28:36.445
THAT YOU'RE A TWO-FACED,
CONDESCENDING BITCH

28:36.445 --> 28:40.189
WHO WILL NEVER MAKE A NICKEL
OFF MY DEAD GRANDMA'S BRACIOLE!

28:42.091 --> 28:43.953
BUT ENJOY THE COOKIES!

28:45.394 --> 28:46.355
(sighs)

28:46.355 --> 28:50.259
THAT'S INSANE.
 I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU.

28:50.259 --> 28:52.401
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN NICK.

28:52.401 --> 28:55.104
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?
IT WAS DARK.

28:55.104 --> 28:58.808
YOU TOLD THE POLICE YOU COULDN'T
SEE WHO ATTACKED YOU.
 THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
HE LOVES ME.

28:58.808 --> 29:00.810
EXACTLY, AND YOU BROKE UP
WITH HIM.

29:00.810 --> 29:03.843
HONEY, THIS IS SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO CONSIDER.

29:03.843 --> 29:07.416
WELL, I CAN'T CONSIDER IT,
OKAY? I JUST CAN'T.

29:10.379 --> 29:13.853
JULIE... WE WATCHED YOU
GROW UP.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.085
YOU'RE LIKE A DAUGHTER
TO US.

29:16.085 --> 29:20.059
WE CAN'T STAND BY
AND DO NOTHING.

29:20.059 --> 29:23.132
(sighs) SO YOU'RE GONNA
TALK TO THE POLICE

29:23.132 --> 29:25.134
NO MATTER WHAT I SAY.

29:25.134 --> 29:27.266
I THINK WE HAVE TO.

29:34.403 --> 29:37.406
(voice breaking)
IT JUST COULDN'T BE HIM.

29:37.406 --> 29:39.408
(knock on door)

29:41.550 --> 29:43.282
YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

29:43.282 --> 29:45.254
THE AGENCY GAVE ME THIS ADDRESS.

29:45.254 --> 29:48.417
PLEASE, IVANA,
I NEED YOU TO COME BACK.

29:48.417 --> 29:51.390
YOUR HUSBAND TOLD THE AGENCY
THAT I AM A LOUSY HOUSEKEEPER.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.523
YOU NEVER TOLD HIM
WHAT I WAS REALLY DOING.

29:54.523 --> 29:57.126
THE AGENCY ALMOST FIRED ME.
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

29:57.126 --> 29:59.268
OH, NO, NO, NO!
WAIT! WAIT!

29:59.268 --> 30:01.300
I NEED YOU!
JUANITA NEEDS YOU.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.902
OW!

30:02.902 --> 30:05.404
SEE? SHE NEEDS YOU.
SHE HAS A TEST TOMORROW,

30:05.404 --> 30:08.137
AND WHEN I TEACH HER,
ONE OF US ENDS UP IN TEARS.

30:08.137 --> 30:12.211
DON'T MAKE ME TEACH MY BABY.
 I'M SORRY.
I HAVE FLOORS TO SCRUB.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.213
FORGET SCRUBBING.
IVANA, YOU HAVE A GIFT.

30:14.213 --> 30:17.116
SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD,
STARTING WITH MY DAUGHTER.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.488
WHAT ABOUT THE FLOOR?

30:29.298 --> 30:31.000
YOU MISSED A SPOT.

30:32.301 --> 30:33.362
(sighs)

30:43.412 --> 30:46.445
(sighs)

30:46.445 --> 30:49.278
(door opens)

30:49.278 --> 30:50.880
(door closes)

30:50.880 --> 30:52.421
GOT A MINUTE?

30:52.421 --> 30:53.522
(sets utensil down)

30:53.522 --> 30:55.524
THIS REALLY
ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

30:55.524 --> 30:59.088
OOH. GNOCCHI.

31:01.590 --> 31:03.893
MMM.

31:03.893 --> 31:05.294
TASTY.

31:05.294 --> 31:06.595
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.

31:06.595 --> 31:11.300
ANGIE'S ARE LIGHT AS AIR.
MINE ARE LIKE LITTLE SHOT PUTS.

31:11.300 --> 31:14.403
WELL, PERHAPS THIS WILL
CHEER YOU UP.

31:14.403 --> 31:17.076
I WENT TO THAT JEWELRY STORE
ON MAPLE

31:17.076 --> 31:19.248
AND LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

31:19.248 --> 31:23.082
YOU LIKE IT?
 I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.215
YOU KNOW, IT'S ODD. I ASKED
THEM ABOUT THE FIRST BROOCH,

31:26.215 --> 31:28.457
BUT THEY SAID--
 OH, FOR GOD SAKES, ORSON,
WOULD YOU JUST STOP IT?!

31:28.457 --> 31:31.460
I HAVE TOLD YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN
I WANT A DIVORCE.

31:31.460 --> 31:34.293
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN CHANGE
MY MIND WITH TRINKETS?

31:34.293 --> 31:37.466
I DON'T WANT JEWELRY.
I DON'T WANT ROMANTIC GESTURES.

31:37.466 --> 31:41.130
I WANT OUT! NOW WOULD YOU
PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE?

31:41.130 --> 31:44.373
OR FOR GOD SAKES, I SWEAR
I'LL THROW SOMETHING AT YOU!

31:44.373 --> 31:46.375
JUST NOT ONE OF THE GNOCCHI.

31:46.375 --> 31:48.978
THOSE THINGS COULD PUT
A MAN'S EYE OUT.

31:48.978 --> 31:50.909
(door opens)

31:50.909 --> 31:54.343
SORRY I'M LATE!

31:54.343 --> 31:59.218
I HAD TO TAKE DOWN SOME GEEZER
IN THE TEN ITEMS OR LESS LINE.

31:59.218 --> 32:04.954
IVANA, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY SPLIT
BEFORE CARLOS GETS HO--OH, MY!

32:04.954 --> 32:06.956
YEAH, I GOT OFF WORK EARLY,

32:06.956 --> 32:09.698
SO I LET OUR CLEANING WOMAN
GO HOME.

32:09.698 --> 32:12.962
(chuckles nervously)

32:12.962 --> 32:16.505
JUANITA, GOOD JOB.
LET'S KNOCK OFF EARLY TODAY.

32:16.505 --> 32:17.967
OKAY, DADDY.

32:22.341 --> 32:26.275
AHEM.

32:26.275 --> 32:29.078
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
I THINK CELIA FELL DOWN.

32:29.078 --> 32:30.679
GABY.

32:30.679 --> 32:33.052
(sighs) I'M SORRY.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.054
I ASKED YOU FOR HELP.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.356
I ASKED FOR A TUTOR,
AND YOU SAID NO.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.058
BECAUSE YOU'RE HER MOTHER.

32:39.058 --> 32:42.231
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SET
ASIDE A FEW HOURS EACH DAY

32:42.231 --> 32:45.234
TO TEACH YOUR OWN DAUGHTER.
 AND I WILL TEACH HER.

32:45.234 --> 32:47.536
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS
I'M GONNA TEACH HER--

32:47.536 --> 32:49.538
HOW TO DRESS,
HOW TO PUT ON MAKEUP.

32:49.538 --> 32:52.541
I'LL EVEN SHOW HER HOW
TO GET A BOY TO NOTICE HER.

32:52.541 --> 32:56.175
THAT'S STUFF I KNOW. AND WE'RE
GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

32:56.175 --> 33:00.549
BUT FRACTIONS AND GRAMMAR
AND HISTORY--

33:00.549 --> 33:03.482
IT'S JUST NOT MY THING,
AND SHE KNOWS IT.

33:03.482 --> 33:07.516
AND THEN SHE GETS FRUSTRATED
BECAUSE I'M FRUSTRATED.

33:07.516 --> 33:10.389
AND IT'S RUINING
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.621
COME ON, GABY.
LET'S NOT EXAGGERATE.

33:12.621 --> 33:14.993
(sighs)

33:14.993 --> 33:16.995
CARLOS, SHE TURNED ME DOWN

33:16.995 --> 33:19.998
WHEN I ASKED TO TAKE HER
FOR ICE CREAM.

33:22.431 --> 33:24.433
HOLY...

33:24.433 --> 33:26.135
I KNOW. I KNOW.

33:26.135 --> 33:28.137
SOME MOMS ARE MADE
TO HOMESCHOOL,

33:28.137 --> 33:30.709
AND I'M JUST NOT
ONE OF THEM.

33:33.282 --> 33:34.513
OKAY.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.446
I GET IT. HMM?

33:37.446 --> 33:39.488
WE WILL FIGURE
SOMETHING ELSE OUT.

33:39.488 --> 33:42.551
YOU WON'T HAVE TO
HOMESCHOOL HER ANYMORE.

33:42.551 --> 33:44.553
OH. (whispers)
THANK YOU, CARLOS.

33:44.553 --> 33:46.725
YOU'RE WELCOME.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.428
(normal voice, breaking)
CAN I KEEP THE HOUSEKEEPER?

33:49.428 --> 33:51.100
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

33:51.100 --> 33:54.803
(crying)

33:54.803 --> 33:56.665
(whispers)
I KNOW. I KNOW.

33:56.665 --> 33:58.167
(whimpers)

33:58.167 --> 34:01.240
(knock on door)

34:01.240 --> 34:04.373
MAY I COME IN, PLEASE?
 WHAT NOW?

34:04.373 --> 34:06.815
(closes door)

34:06.815 --> 34:10.449
UM... (clears throat)
I JUST...

34:10.449 --> 34:12.420
CAME TO SAY I'M SORRY.

34:12.420 --> 34:15.053
WHAT I DID WAS WRONG,

34:15.053 --> 34:18.627
AND THOSE NAMES
YOU CALLED ME WERE HARSH

34:18.627 --> 34:20.458
BUT REGRETTABLY ACCURATE.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.532
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D EVEN
CONSIDER WORKING FOR ME NOW,

34:23.532 --> 34:26.235
BUT IF YOU WOULD,
I WOULD BE HONORED

34:26.235 --> 34:28.397
TO HAVE YOU IN MY KITCHEN.

34:28.397 --> 34:31.639
WELL, WELL, WELL. YOU MUST
BE DROWNING OVER THERE.

34:31.639 --> 34:34.373
ALL RIGHT, I'M DROWNING.

34:34.373 --> 34:37.346
AND YOU WANT ME TO SAVE YOU.

34:37.346 --> 34:38.377
PLEASE.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.351
FIRST, TELL ME THIS.

34:45.254 --> 34:47.255
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME?

34:47.255 --> 34:48.817
I LIKE YOU.

34:48.817 --> 34:51.389
I FIND YOU COLORFUL AND--

34:51.389 --> 34:54.393
OH, ENOUGH WITH THE TACT.

34:57.666 --> 35:00.869
FINE. I...

35:00.869 --> 35:02.831
YOU MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

35:04.673 --> 35:06.675
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND

35:06.675 --> 35:09.378
WHEN SOMEONE IS AS CANDID
AS YOU ARE.

35:09.378 --> 35:11.380
YOU SAY WHATEVER
POPS IN YOUR MIND.

35:11.380 --> 35:13.712
YOU FIGHT WITH YOUR HUSBAND
IN FRONT OF GUESTS--

35:13.712 --> 35:15.414
OH, WELL,
NOT EVERYONE'S MARRIAGE

35:15.414 --> 35:17.486
IS AS PERFECT AS YOURS,
NANCY REAGAN.

35:17.486 --> 35:20.419
MY MARRIAGE IS NOT PERFECT.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.551
OH, COME ON.

35:22.551 --> 35:25.254
ORSON AND I BARELY
SPEAK TO EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

35:25.254 --> 35:28.427
WE HAVEN'T SHARED A BED
IN THREE MONTHS.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.630
SERIOUSLY?

35:36.165 --> 35:38.167
WELL,
I NEVER WOULD'VE GUESSED.

35:38.167 --> 35:39.808
THAT'S THE POINT.

35:39.808 --> 35:41.510
OUR PROBLEMS ARE PERSONAL.

35:41.510 --> 35:43.842
WE DON'T SHARE THEM
WITH THE WORLD.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.675
BUT YOU CAN'T SEEM TO KEEP
ANYTHING TO YOURSELF.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.880
(laughs)

35:51.880 --> 35:53.582
WHAT?

35:53.582 --> 35:56.485
OH. (sighs)

35:56.485 --> 35:57.856
TRUST ME, HONEY.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.559
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I KNOW HOW TO DO,

36:00.559 --> 36:02.561
IT'S KEEP THINGS TO MYSELF.

36:09.538 --> 36:12.471
WELL... THERE WE ARE.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.172
YOU THINK I'M VULGAR.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.444
I--

36:15.444 --> 36:17.746
OH, EXCUSE ME. CANDID.

36:17.746 --> 36:21.450
AND I THINK
YOU'RE A TIGHT ASS.

36:21.450 --> 36:23.952
BUT YOU NEED HELP,
AND I NEED A JOB,

36:23.952 --> 36:27.256
SO... LET'S GET COOKIN'.

36:27.256 --> 36:29.288
YOU MEAN IT?

36:30.589 --> 36:32.761
(whispers)
THANK YOU, ANGIE.

36:32.761 --> 36:34.823
(normal voice)
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

36:37.826 --> 36:39.928
SO... NO SEX
FOR THREE MONTHS.

36:39.928 --> 36:42.431
WHAT DO YOU DO,
SIT ON THE DRYER?

36:42.431 --> 36:46.505
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST
GOADING ME.

36:46.505 --> 36:49.478
ONE HAM ON WHEAT,
EXTRA MAYO.

36:49.478 --> 36:51.410
CORNED BEEF, LEAN,

36:51.410 --> 36:55.414
AND OF COURSE,
AN ENTIRE JAR OF PICKLES.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.446
(chuckles)
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

36:57.446 --> 37:00.789
HONESTLY, UH, I DON'T THINK
THIS NEW DETECTIVE

37:00.789 --> 37:02.791
IS UP TO THE JOB,

37:02.791 --> 37:05.494
AND I NEED A COUPLE
OF SEASONED PROS

37:05.494 --> 37:08.527
WITH OLD SCHOOL SAVVY--
 OH, HELLO, SUSAN.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.658
DENISE.

37:09.658 --> 37:14.503
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME "MOOSE"?
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

37:14.503 --> 37:15.704
MOOSE?

37:15.704 --> 37:17.306
MOOSE? (laughs)

37:20.309 --> 37:22.611
DENISE, I'M GLAD
I RAN INTO YOU.

37:22.611 --> 37:25.474
I... I CAME DOWN HERE
TO APOLOGIZE.

37:25.474 --> 37:28.617
NO, YOU CAME DOWN HERE TO
GET ME KICKED OFF THE CASE.

37:28.617 --> 37:32.681
OKAY. ONE MORE THING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

37:32.681 --> 37:35.684
SO LOOK, UM, I REALLY AM SORRY
ABOUT MARK MALONE,

37:35.684 --> 37:37.686
BUT THAT WAS AGES AGO,

37:37.686 --> 37:40.829
AND THAT GUY HAD "LOSER"
WRITTEN ALL OVER HIM.

37:40.829 --> 37:43.532
HMM. HE'S THE C.E.O.
OF MALONE ENTERPRISES

37:43.532 --> 37:46.635
WITH A 6-BEDROOM HOME
OVERLOOKING THE LAKE.

37:46.635 --> 37:49.768
OKAY. THE POINT IS,

37:49.768 --> 37:53.342
I'D HATE FOR OUR HISTORY
TO CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT

37:53.342 --> 37:54.843
IN THIS CASE.

37:54.843 --> 37:57.546
YOU THINK I'M BEHAVING
UNPROFESSIONALLY.

37:57.546 --> 37:59.948
WELL...

37:59.948 --> 38:02.511
WHEN YOU WERE LEAVING
KATHERINE'S HOUSE THE OTHER DAY,

38:02.511 --> 38:05.784
YOU TWO DID LOOK...
PRETTY CHUMMY.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.787
OH, WELL, IT TURNS OUT
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.590
WE BOTH HAD BOYFRIENDS
STOLEN BY YOU.

38:11.590 --> 38:14.423
I DID NOT STEAL MIKE.

38:14.423 --> 38:16.294
KATHERINE JUST THINKS
THAT I DID,

38:16.294 --> 38:19.468
WHICH IS WHY I'M BETTING
SHE STRANGLED JULIE.
 YEAH, WELL, SHE COULDN'T HAVE,

38:19.468 --> 38:22.331
BECAUSE SHE WAS ON THE PHONE
ALL NIGHT WITH HER DAUGHTER,

38:22.331 --> 38:24.573
AND THE PHONE RECORDS
CONFIRM IT.
 ARE YOU SURE?

38:24.573 --> 38:27.836
I KNOW HOW TO DO MY JOB,
SUSAN.

38:27.836 --> 38:29.838
IN FACT, I'VE DISCOVERED
SOME INTERESTING FACTS

38:29.838 --> 38:32.781
WHILE INVESTIGATING
THIS CASE.

38:32.781 --> 38:34.643
IS IT TRUE

38:34.643 --> 38:36.645
THAT ON THE EVENING
OF SEPTEMBER 16th

38:36.645 --> 38:39.317
AT APPROXIMATELY 11:45,

38:39.317 --> 38:41.550
YOU SHOT KATHERINE MAYFAIR?

38:41.550 --> 38:44.493
WHAT? THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

38:44.493 --> 38:48.056
AND YOU NOT REPORTING IT
WAS A CRIME.

38:48.056 --> 38:52.531
OKAY, UM, LET'S NOT
BLOW THIS OUT OF PROPORTION.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.002
I HURT YOU,

38:54.002 --> 38:57.366
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA GET PAST THIS.
YOU CAN'T KEEP BLAMING ME

38:57.366 --> 38:59.668
FOR THE WAY
THAT YOUR LIFE TURNED OUT.

38:59.668 --> 39:03.512
IT'S JUST... IT'S GONNA MAKE YOU
BITTER AND MISERABLE,

39:03.512 --> 39:05.544
LIKE KATHERINE.

39:05.544 --> 39:08.577
YOU NEED CLOSURE, DENISE.

39:08.577 --> 39:11.450
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO BE HAPPY.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.522
AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

39:13.522 --> 39:15.954
TO REMAIN SILENT.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.429
IN YOU GO!

39:20.429 --> 39:22.831
HEY, SUSAN, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS CALLED?

39:22.831 --> 39:24.393
CLOSURE.

39:24.393 --> 39:28.497
(cackling)

39:37.976 --> 39:40.979
THE JULIE MAYER ASSAULT?
WE'RE NOT ON THAT CASE ANYMORE.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.481
DETECTIVE LAPERA'S
HANDLING THAT.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.682
WHY?

39:43.682 --> 39:46.384
WELL, WE HAVE SOME
NEW INFORMATION TO REPORT.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.517
THE DETECTIVE IS OUT ON A CALL
AT THE MOMENT.

39:48.517 --> 39:50.519
THIS NEEDS TO BE CHECKED OUT
RIGHT AWAY.

39:50.519 --> 39:52.390
WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHECKED OUT
RIGHT AWAY?

39:52.390 --> 39:54.763
DID YOU GUYS EVER TALK
TO NICK BOLEN?

39:54.763 --> 39:58.927
THE DAD OF THE KID WE ARRESTED.
YEAH, YEAH, WE TALKED TO HIM.

39:58.927 --> 40:02.170
I'M GUESSING HE DIDN'T
MENTION THAT HE AND JULIE

40:02.170 --> 40:04.172
WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

40:04.172 --> 40:07.175
SHE BROKE IT OFF
RIGHT BEFORE SHE WAS ATTACKED.

40:07.175 --> 40:09.838
NO KIDDIN'.

40:12.611 --> 40:14.913
HEY, BABE. WHAT'S UP?

40:14.913 --> 40:17.516
(singsong voice) GOOD NEWS.
I AM A WORKING GIRL.

40:17.516 --> 40:20.018
(normal voice) BREE ASKED ME
TO JOIN HER COMPANY.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.921
YEAH? HEY, THAT'S GREAT.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.594
HEY, YOU'RE STILL GONNA
COOK FOR ME, RIGHT?

40:25.594 --> 40:27.596
ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU'RE MY GUINEA PIG.

40:27.596 --> 40:30.799
(chuckles)
MWAH. CONGRATS.

40:30.799 --> 40:34.002
OH, AND THERE WAS SOMETHING
ELSE I NEEDED TO TELL YOU.

40:34.002 --> 40:36.004
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
COPS CALLED.

40:36.004 --> 40:38.006
THEY WANTED TO KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE

40:38.006 --> 40:40.739
THE NIGHT THAT
JULIE MAYER WAS STRANGLED.

40:40.739 --> 40:44.212
(chuckles) WHAT?

40:44.212 --> 40:46.214
WHY WOULD THEY BE
ASKING ABOUT ME?

40:46.214 --> 40:50.078
I GUESS BECAUSE YOU WERE
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH HER?

40:50.078 --> 40:53.181
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY TOLD YOU.

40:53.181 --> 40:55.854
THEY DIDN'T TELL ME
ANYTHING.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.556
I'VE KNOWN FOR WEEKS.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.728
ANGE...

40:59.728 --> 41:03.762
DON'T. DON'T EMBARRASS
YOURSELF... OR ME.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.764
YOU DID A STUPID THING.

41:07.496 --> 41:09.498
BUT I KNOW
YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE,

41:09.498 --> 41:11.800
AND YOU KNOW
I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.643
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET PAST THIS.

41:14.643 --> 41:17.606
I'M SO SORRY.

41:17.606 --> 41:20.609
I'VE PUT YOU THROUGH A LOT,
SO YOU GET THIS ONE.

41:20.609 --> 41:22.681
BUT THAT'S IT.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.753
YOU KNOW
I NEVER ATTACKED HER.

41:24.753 --> 41:27.686
AND THAT IS WHY I LIED
AND TOLD THE COPS

41:27.686 --> 41:29.688
YOU WERE WITH ME
THE ENTIRE NIGHT.

41:29.688 --> 41:33.722
(sighs) SO WE'RE OKAY?

41:40.669 --> 41:42.801
(grunts)

41:42.801 --> 41:45.003
NOW WE'RE OKAY.

41:47.576 --> 41:49.778
OW.

41:49.778 --> 41:52.110
THE TRUTH IS,

41:52.110 --> 41:57.586
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
WE CAN LEARN FROM BOOKS.

41:57.586 --> 42:00.889
THEY CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW TO MAKE YOUR WIFE HAPPY.

42:03.752 --> 42:08.697
THEY CAN'T TELL YOU HOW
TO APPRECIATE YOUR NEIGHBOR.

42:11.730 --> 42:15.934
THEY CAN'T TELL YOU IF THAT MAN
ACROSS THE STREET IS DANGEROUS.

42:18.637 --> 42:25.974
NO, THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY LEARN
IS FROM YOUR MISTAKES.

42:25.974 --> 42:29.648
OF COURSE, IF THOSE MISTAKES
LAND YOU IN JAIL,

42:29.648 --> 42:33.181
IT MIGHT BE NICE
TO HAVE A BOOK

42:33.181 --> 42:36.655
TO PASS THE TIME.
