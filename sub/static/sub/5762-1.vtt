00:01.755 --> 00:03.721
-We're getting ready.
-For what?

00:03.721 --> 00:04.782
For what's coming.

00:05.756 --> 00:08.381
He's been planning this
for quite some time.

00:08.381 --> 00:09.777
We're blocking
the light.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.806
No, this is bigger
than just him.

00:18.787 --> 00:20.648
It's time for you
to know who you are.

00:23.044 --> 00:24.912
And to know
who your brother is.

00:29.183 --> 00:30.890
He said i have a brother.

00:30.890 --> 00:33.265
Who said this? Who told
you you have a brother?

00:33.265 --> 00:35.033
My father.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

00:45.652 --> 00:46.962
No, i don't think so.

00:46.962 --> 00:48.630
Definitely a concussion.

00:48.630 --> 00:51.413
So she may feel confused
or a little dizzy.

00:52.107 --> 00:55.253
We're talking about an injury that's
only a couple of days old, so...

00:55.253 --> 00:56.433
Long-term?

00:56.433 --> 01:00.196
Barring any second impact,
she'll be fine. Really.

01:00.196 --> 01:02.359
Look, just hang out,
you know,

01:02.359 --> 01:04.507
until i make sure the pictures
are ok, then you can go.

01:04.507 --> 01:05.631
Thanks, doc.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.658
No problem.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.231
Are you ok?

01:10.231 --> 01:11.665
Yeah, i'm just tired.

01:11.665 --> 01:13.721
I almost lost you
up in that field.

01:13.721 --> 01:15.575
If it wasn't for those kids...

01:15.575 --> 01:17.794
I don't know if i could
ever thank them enough.

01:24.669 --> 01:26.028
We gotta
talk about this.

01:26.028 --> 01:27.360
What is there to talk about?

01:27.360 --> 01:28.977
I told you everything
that i saw.

01:28.977 --> 01:30.309
Yeah, but what
does it mean?

01:30.654 --> 01:31.996
Do you really think
it was your father

01:31.996 --> 01:32.588
in the light?

01:32.588 --> 01:34.609
If he's dead, i have
to find out what happened.

01:34.609 --> 01:36.444
And if he was
telling the truth...

01:36.444 --> 01:38.381
That you have a brother.

01:38.778 --> 01:40.223
What if it is gabriel?

01:41.477 --> 01:43.256
Well, then
we'll deal with it.

01:44.911 --> 01:46.739
He hasn't been
anywhere in grandview.

01:46.739 --> 01:48.165
He's disappeared again.

01:48.165 --> 01:50.762
Oh, melinda, jim, sorry.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.181
We'll have to take
those x-rays again,

01:52.181 --> 01:53.979
there was some kind
of exposure problem.

01:53.979 --> 01:55.172
It'll just take a second.

01:58.754 --> 02:00.334
So, john, let's just
reset and we'll do

02:00.334 --> 02:01.571
that first series again.

02:01.571 --> 02:04.327
Then start
with the next three.

02:04.327 --> 02:06.719
I'll give you a hand.
ok.

~~The Underneath~~

02:54.314 --> 02:55.519
That was
the best concert

02:55.519 --> 02:56.396
i ever went to.

02:57.237 --> 02:59.342
Hi, mom, it's me.

02:59.342 --> 03:01.366
Um, i just got back
from the doctor

03:01.366 --> 03:02.574
and everything looks good.

03:02.574 --> 03:05.007
I do need
to talk to you, though.

03:05.007 --> 03:07.139
It's kind of important,
so call me. Bye.

03:09.550 --> 03:12.508
Here, it's been in and out
of so many attics and basements.

03:12.543 --> 03:14.823
I've lost track. I was gonna
just chuck it, but...

03:14.823 --> 03:16.484
Oh, never chuck.
chucking is bad.

03:16.484 --> 03:17.905
Look.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.106
Well, there's a lot
of cool stuff, i guess.

03:20.106 --> 03:22.565
Are you kidding?
this stuff is great.

03:22.565 --> 03:24.753
Yeah. Yeah, it all
belonged to my father.

03:26.861 --> 03:28.730
Are you sure that you
want to part with this?

03:28.730 --> 03:30.361
I mean, it all looks
pretty personal.

03:30.361 --> 03:31.985
Oh, yeah, yeah, you know,
my parents died when

03:31.985 --> 03:32.705
i was pretty young,

03:32.705 --> 03:34.470
so i didn't really know them.

03:34.470 --> 03:36.696
I don't even know most of the
people in those pictures, so...

03:36.696 --> 03:38.581
-Oh, i'm so sorry.
-oh, don't be.

03:38.581 --> 03:40.730
Don't be. I don't spend
much time in the past.

03:40.730 --> 03:43.548
I work in one direction,
and that's forward.

03:43.548 --> 03:46.472
So how does this work?
like consignment?

03:46.472 --> 03:48.730
Yeah, we'll
inventory everything,

03:48.730 --> 03:49.693
get some prices,

03:49.693 --> 03:51.351
figure out how
we want to present it,

03:51.351 --> 03:53.243
and then we'll call you
when things start to move.

03:53.243 --> 03:56.166
Great, that's awesome.
um, let me give you my number.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.056
Oh, great.

03:57.056 --> 03:59.331
Just ask
for jennifer billings.

03:59.331 --> 04:00.778
Here you go.
thank you.

04:00.778 --> 04:01.808
And talk to you soon?

04:01.808 --> 04:03.951
Yeah, probably by the end
of next week.

04:03.951 --> 04:05.701
-Great. Thank you.
-Thanks.

04:09.185 --> 04:10.959
What's up with you?

04:12.829 --> 04:13.593
Nothing.

04:14.929 --> 04:17.515
Hey, why don't you
take the trunk downstairs,

04:17.515 --> 04:19.594
and then i can do
the inventory on it later.

04:19.594 --> 04:21.988
Ok, well, just let me
go through these returns

04:21.988 --> 04:22.895
and then
i'll bring it down.

04:22.895 --> 04:25.746
Yeah, why don't we just
get it out of the way,

04:25.746 --> 04:26.653
you know?

04:26.653 --> 04:30.346
Just bring it downstairs,

04:30.346 --> 04:32.643
and that way no one will look
through it before we're ready.

04:32.643 --> 04:33.619
Are you all right?

04:33.619 --> 04:34.962
Yeah, yeah, i'm fine.

04:34.962 --> 04:37.150
I'm just trying to get
everything organized.

05:43.255 --> 05:45.481
Surprise!

05:46.975 --> 05:48.073
Come on!

05:51.781 --> 05:53.325
In recognition
of your heroic acts,

05:53.325 --> 05:56.257
which saved the lives
of many of grandview's children,

05:56.257 --> 05:59.927
the town council presents
you with this plaque.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.916
I don't know
what to say.

06:01.916 --> 06:03.539
I don't really
want to say anything.

06:03.539 --> 06:05.499
Thanks, everybody.
Melinda really

06:05.499 --> 06:06.768
appreciates it.

06:07.026 --> 06:08.073
Let's have
some cake, ok?

06:08.073 --> 06:09.273
All right!

06:09.273 --> 06:11.561
Ok, can i just, uh,
get one with everybody?

06:11.561 --> 06:12.483
Can you get me
out of here?

06:12.483 --> 06:13.552
I gotta go to work.

06:13.552 --> 06:15.041
How about you?
Lunch?

06:15.041 --> 06:17.040
If it's a lunch that
involves food, yeah, i'm in.

06:20.024 --> 06:23.822
You know, that night
when i thought you died,

06:23.822 --> 06:27.330
i mean, i...Thought you died
right in front of me.

06:29.410 --> 06:31.714
Every feeling inside of me
just dropped.

06:31.714 --> 06:34.826
All of them. All the things i
wish i could have said to you,

06:34.826 --> 06:36.947
i was never going to be able
to say to you.

06:38.146 --> 06:39.150
Did we get
the check?

06:40.892 --> 06:43.071
Oh, good. That is mine. I asked you.

06:43.071 --> 06:45.605
Ok, well, in that case,
i'm still hungry.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.173
So what do you think
me seeing this door means?

06:48.173 --> 06:50.201
I mean, it had, like,
a viewport

06:50.201 --> 06:52.490
and i could hear strange
noises coming from behind it,

06:52.490 --> 06:54.815
like, wood falling
and beams crashing.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.749
Sounds like me
doing home repairs.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.865
What could it symbolize?

06:58.865 --> 07:01.502
Well, doors usually mean
endings or beginnings.

07:01.502 --> 07:04.860
Certain mythologies believe
that the way to the truth

07:04.860 --> 07:06.312
is by choosing the right door.

07:06.312 --> 07:09.031
Or maybe that's a game show
i'm thinking of.

07:09.031 --> 07:11.546
Something else weird
happened to me

07:11.546 --> 07:12.524
at the doctor's.

07:12.524 --> 07:15.921
There was a face
behind mine in the x-ray.

07:16.650 --> 07:18.050
Do you think
it was your father?

07:18.050 --> 07:19.093
I don't know.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.891
Even your x-rays are haunted.

07:21.891 --> 07:23.654
That's hardcore.

07:24.514 --> 07:26.472
When was the last time
you saw your father?

07:26.472 --> 07:27.750
When i was 11.

07:33.030 --> 07:34.516
What about
gabriel?

07:34.516 --> 07:35.756
Nowhere to be found.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.279
Which proves
that this town

07:37.279 --> 07:39.348
is too small for 2
people that see ghosts.

07:39.348 --> 07:41.821
Right now i'm just gonna concentrate
on what happened to my dad.

07:41.821 --> 07:43.037
How are you
going to do that?

07:43.037 --> 07:44.656
Guess i have to talk
to my mother.

07:44.656 --> 07:47.282
If she's calmed down enough
since the accident.

07:47.282 --> 07:48.977
Well, don't you think
she would have told you

07:48.977 --> 07:50.145
if she saw him?

07:50.145 --> 07:51.136
Not necessarily.

07:51.136 --> 07:53.070
My mom has spent
her whole life

07:53.070 --> 07:54.739
trying to deny
that she could see spirits.

07:54.739 --> 07:56.613
I just found out she
could see them 2 years ago.

07:56.613 --> 07:57.834
She hates talking
about my father,

07:57.834 --> 07:59.471
and she hates talking
about anything

07:59.471 --> 08:00.861
that has to do
with her real feelings.

08:00.861 --> 08:02.101
So it should be
a productive visit,

08:02.101 --> 08:02.652
all in all.

08:02.653 --> 08:04.715
-Some kind of family, huh?
-you should see mine.

08:04.715 --> 08:05.914
All they want to do
is talk about

08:05.915 --> 08:07.156
their feelings. And 
they were the happy ones.

08:07.156 --> 08:10.129
I guess we all have
our haunted x-rays,

08:10.129 --> 08:11.239
one way
or the other.

08:15.376 --> 08:16.167
What?

08:16.167 --> 08:17.807
Do you see that?

08:17.807 --> 08:20.002
I don't see anything.

08:20.002 --> 08:21.864
What-- what is it?

08:29.939 --> 08:31.244
I'm not sure.

08:34.102 --> 08:36.864
Uh, i gotta go.

08:37.607 --> 08:38.857
Yeah, i'll call you later.

08:38.857 --> 08:39.851
Ok.

08:50.376 --> 08:52.512
I'm just asking, when is
the last time you saw dad?

08:52.512 --> 08:54.116
I don't remember.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.227
Mom, come on.

08:55.227 --> 08:56.761
I'm serious.

08:56.761 --> 08:59.594
I barely think of him
if i can help it.

08:59.594 --> 09:00.974
I know, but this
is important.

09:00.974 --> 09:01.621
Why?

09:01.621 --> 09:03.822
Would you know if
anything happened to him?

09:03.822 --> 09:05.483
What are you talking about?

09:05.483 --> 09:06.796
I think dad's dead.

09:13.068 --> 09:14.659
How do you know that?

09:14.659 --> 09:16.438
Because i saw him.

09:16.438 --> 09:18.899
When i was...

09:18.899 --> 09:22.239
When i died on the field.

09:22.239 --> 09:24.786
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

09:24.786 --> 09:26.012
I'm telling you now.

09:26.012 --> 09:28.036
And he said
i have a brother.

09:28.292 --> 09:29.704
Melinda...

09:31.048 --> 09:33.715
This is the second
serious head injury

09:33.715 --> 09:34.360
you have had.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.688
No, don't you do that!

09:35.688 --> 09:38.338
I am sorry, i'm just
saying that it is possible

09:38.338 --> 09:40.136
that your mind
is creating all of this.

09:40.136 --> 09:41.601
Mom, would you
please stop it?

09:41.601 --> 09:43.325
I know what i saw
and what i heard.

09:43.325 --> 09:45.431
Now, i am being haunted
by someone or something

09:45.431 --> 09:47.245
and i think it has
something to do with him,

09:47.245 --> 09:49.097
because he's trying
to tell me something.

09:49.097 --> 09:50.238
Tell you what?

09:50.238 --> 09:50.980
I don't know.

09:50.980 --> 09:53.132
But i-- i think it has to
do with the underground.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.792
I don't know
what you want from me.

09:56.792 --> 09:58.100
I want you
to talk to me.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.483
Ok? Do you think
that's he dead?

10:00.483 --> 10:01.602
Do i have a brother?

10:04.494 --> 10:07.923
If you're asking me
did i have a second child, no.

10:07.923 --> 10:10.447
And far as your father goes,
how would i know?

10:10.447 --> 10:12.566
He walked out on us
years ago.

10:12.566 --> 10:14.578
It's not exactly like
he kept in touch.

10:14.578 --> 10:16.599
Have you seen him?

10:18.806 --> 10:19.968
His spirit?

10:21.643 --> 10:23.245
No.

10:24.428 --> 10:26.319
Mom, is there something
that you're not telling

10:26.319 --> 10:27.442
me that could help?

10:27.954 --> 10:29.665
Do you know
where he was living?

10:29.665 --> 10:31.599
What's the last thing
that you rember about him?

10:33.309 --> 10:36.133
The last thing
i remember about him

10:36.133 --> 10:39.436
is how hard you cried
when he left...

10:39.828 --> 10:41.037
For days.

10:41.037 --> 10:44.456
Don't romanticize him,
melinda.

10:44.456 --> 10:46.517
He doesn't deserve it.

11:40.762 --> 11:42.322
Hey, what's this?

11:42.322 --> 11:45.134
I had a customer today
who's looking to sell

11:45.134 --> 11:46.247
a trunk of old stuff.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.415
It made me think
of my old stuff.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.276
Maybe there's a clue in here,
something i missed.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.117
How'd it go
with your mother?

11:51.117 --> 11:52.881
Full metal lockdown,
as expected.

11:54.802 --> 11:55.821
Look at you.

11:55.821 --> 11:58.713
Oh, how beautiful.
those eyes.

11:58.713 --> 12:01.327
I just
keep looking at him,

12:01.327 --> 12:03.189
thinking, "what is
underneath that smile?"

12:03.642 --> 12:05.710
what does he know, and if
he's trying to tell me

12:05.710 --> 12:08.656
something right now, then why 
doesn't he just come to me and tell me?

12:08.656 --> 12:09.628
Am i being obsessive?

12:09.628 --> 12:11.158
Yeah, but
with good reason.

12:11.158 --> 12:13.766
Your father dying's
a big deal, no matter

12:13.766 --> 12:14.916
how you felt about him.

12:14.916 --> 12:17.069
My dad was always
this villain in my life,

12:17.069 --> 12:18.600
and now, all of a sudden,
he's gone,

12:18.600 --> 12:20.856
or at least physically gone,

12:20.856 --> 12:22.947
and, i don't know,

12:22.947 --> 12:24.629
i just feel like
there's this big hole.

12:24.629 --> 12:27.057
You didn't really think
he was gonna come back, did you?

12:27.057 --> 12:29.067
I used to fantasize about it
when i was a kid.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.357
You know, that he'd show up
one day after school

12:31.357 --> 12:33.467
and have this explanation
of why he'd left.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.866
You know, like he'd been
kidnapped by spies

12:35.866 --> 12:38.300
and they'd burned all the
letters he was gonna send to me

12:38.300 --> 12:41.616
and then he'd finally escape
and fought his way back to me.

12:41.616 --> 12:42.808
Hmm. That's funny.

12:42.808 --> 12:44.780
Your mom thought you
might romanticize him.

12:46.324 --> 12:49.171
You know, it's hard
to deal with the truth

12:49.171 --> 12:49.948
about our parents.

12:51.089 --> 12:53.084
That moment you discover
that they're just people,

12:53.084 --> 12:55.411
flawed people,
it's painful.

12:55.411 --> 12:58.874
Flawed is a kind description
of my dad.

13:02.893 --> 13:04.899
But, still, if he would have
just come back...

13:06.135 --> 13:08.612
I would have believed
anything he said to me.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.246
And i could have forgiven him
for anything, you know?

13:12.246 --> 13:15.318
I just...I wanted my dad.

13:20.699 --> 13:21.732
I'm sorry.

13:22.611 --> 13:24.649
I'm sorry he hurt you
so much, but...

13:24.649 --> 13:26.814
Think about it
this way--

13:26.814 --> 13:28.764
you have this
beautiful heart,

13:28.764 --> 13:30.850
and he couldn't do
anything to change that.

13:32.248 --> 13:35.086
Wow. That was kind of heavy.

13:35.086 --> 13:37.066
Yeah, i'm kind of
exhausted now.

13:39.700 --> 13:40.763
Are you gonna
come to bed?

13:40.763 --> 13:41.768
Yeah, soon.

14:35.186 --> 14:36.176
It was you!

14:36.176 --> 14:37.841
It was you!

14:37.841 --> 14:38.749
Mel?

14:42.800 --> 14:43.759
It's all right.

14:43.759 --> 14:46.428
You're ok.
there's nothing there.

14:54.864 --> 14:56.145
Jim saw this, too?

14:56.145 --> 14:57.967
No, he heard me yelling,

14:57.967 --> 14:59.268
and by the time
he came out,

14:59.268 --> 15:00.811
everything was back
to normal again.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.334
What?

15:03.334 --> 15:04.693
Nothing.

15:04.693 --> 15:07.331
Do you think
i'm making this up?

15:07.331 --> 15:09.624
No, i do not think
you're making this up.

15:09.624 --> 15:11.690
I'm trying to wrap
my mind around it.

15:11.690 --> 15:13.589
It's just...You know--

15:13.589 --> 15:14.542
hard to believe.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.113
A little, i guess.

15:16.113 --> 15:18.389
Well, at least you're
honest. Gotta love that.

15:19.191 --> 15:21.868
Ok, so you think your dad

15:22.105 --> 15:23.580
is connected
to all this somehow.

15:23.580 --> 15:26.971
Mmm, i'm not sure, but i won't
know until i figure out how he died.

15:26.971 --> 15:29.067
And your mom was no help?

15:29.067 --> 15:31.129
That would be a no.

15:31.129 --> 15:33.349
And every time i go online,
i get thousands of hits.

15:33.349 --> 15:36.100
Apparently, tom gordon
is a very popular name.

15:37.424 --> 15:38.926
Is there anything i can do?

15:38.926 --> 15:39.877
You're doing it.

15:39.877 --> 15:41.870
Thanks for listening
to the rantings

15:41.870 --> 15:43.507
of your very weird
and haunted friend.

15:44.768 --> 15:46.995
Not to cut short
said rantings.

15:46.995 --> 15:50.127
Um, do you mind if i go
meet ned at the dentist?

15:50.127 --> 15:51.582
No, go ahead.
thanks.

15:51.582 --> 15:53.092
Hey, you want anything?

15:53.092 --> 15:53.938
Ooh, a muffin.

15:53.938 --> 15:55.684
Oh, healthy or disgusting?

15:55.684 --> 15:57.312
Mild disgust.

15:57.312 --> 15:58.944
Mmm! That's my girl.

16:04.286 --> 16:05.888
Oh, hello.
feel free to browse.

16:05.888 --> 16:07.381
Let me know if i can
help you with anything.

16:07.381 --> 16:09.389
You don't remember me?

16:09.389 --> 16:12.325
Uh, no. I'm sorry.

16:12.325 --> 16:13.550
I was the one taking
pictures the other day

16:13.550 --> 16:14.769
when you got
your little plaque.

16:14.769 --> 16:16.772
Right. What were
the pictures for?

16:16.772 --> 16:19.001
-And shame the devil.
-I'm sorry?

16:19.001 --> 16:21.257
And shame the devil,
the blog.

16:21.257 --> 16:22.128
Oh, right, yeah.

16:22.128 --> 16:23.970
All the dirt
on driscoll county.

16:23.970 --> 16:25.833
My husband loves that
blog. You write for it?

16:25.833 --> 16:27.564
-I'm it.
-Shame the devil?

16:27.564 --> 16:28.810
Yeah, it's like
from an old proverb.

16:28.810 --> 16:30.679
You know, "tell the truth
and shame the devil."

16:30.679 --> 16:32.880
Right. Shakespeare.
Henry IV.

16:34.986 --> 16:37.584
Um, yeah. Anyways, i have
something i want to show you.

16:37.584 --> 16:39.780
These are the pictures
i took the other day.

16:41.425 --> 16:43.225
Now, i rember
everybody who was there.

16:43.225 --> 16:44.867
I got a quote about you
from each person.

16:44.867 --> 16:49.255
But this dude...This dude
i do not rember,

16:49.255 --> 16:50.708
and he only shows up
for like a second,

16:50.708 --> 16:51.949
and he's not in
any other shots.

16:54.364 --> 16:56.652
Well, maybe it's a--
it's a reflection

16:56.652 --> 16:57.987
from somebody
walking by outside.

16:57.987 --> 17:00.806
A reflection?
Are you serious?

17:01.805 --> 17:03.774
Ok, a light ray
on a reflective surface

17:03.774 --> 17:06.067
is always reflected at angle
equal to the incident angle.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.582
And the angle of incidence

17:07.582 --> 17:09.634
is totly equal
to the angle of reflection.

17:09.634 --> 17:11.008
And if, and only if--

17:11.008 --> 17:13.314
Ok, you know what,
moving on from the whole

17:13.314 --> 17:14.141
reflection idea,

17:14.141 --> 17:15.710
maybe it's just somebody
that we didn't see.

17:15.710 --> 17:17.286
-Yeah, but it gets weirder.
-Really?

17:17.286 --> 17:21.159
Yeah, i enhanced these
and turned then into negatives

17:21.159 --> 17:22.372
to get a better contrast.

17:23.022 --> 17:24.358
Check this out.

17:32.337 --> 17:33.983
Would you
send me these?

17:38.685 --> 17:40.740
Are you sure
this isn't a reflection?

17:40.740 --> 17:43.948
Yeah, i can say that i'm reasonably
sure that is not a reflection.

17:43.948 --> 17:45.539
Maybe it was someone
that was there but you

17:45.539 --> 17:46.414
forgot they were there--

17:46.414 --> 17:47.661
Ok, it's a ghost,
get over it.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.331
Sweet! I mean,
that's great.

17:49.331 --> 17:50.661
That's photographic
evidence.

17:50.661 --> 17:53.304
But, wait, why didn't
you see this on the day?

17:53.304 --> 17:54.092
I don't know.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.426
Why is he so dirty?

18:01.467 --> 18:03.861
Whoa. What,
you think?

18:03.825 --> 18:04.864
I don't know what to think.

18:04.864 --> 18:06.704
I mean, the height
and weight, i guess,

18:06.704 --> 18:07.816
is sort of similar.

18:07.816 --> 18:09.749
Maybe. I mean, would
your father have a reason

18:09.749 --> 18:10.824
for being
this dirty?

18:10.824 --> 18:12.156
Was he secretly
a chimney sweep?

18:12.156 --> 18:13.256
All right, i just...

18:13.256 --> 18:15.682
All i know is that
all these hauntings

18:15.682 --> 18:17.282
have something to do
with things underground.

18:17.282 --> 18:19.835
You know, like, spirits
rising from the depths.

18:19.835 --> 18:22.571
Oh, i hate spirits
rising from the depths.

18:22.571 --> 18:23.605
Don't get me started!

18:23.605 --> 18:25.617
What'd you tell the
blogger kid about this?

18:25.617 --> 18:27.867
I just played dumb,
but i don't really think

18:27.867 --> 18:28.746
he's gonna let it go.

18:28.746 --> 18:30.556
Especially after
he showed me this.

18:36.659 --> 18:37.676
What do you think it is?

18:37.676 --> 18:40.731
A straight, serious
answer, please.

18:42.251 --> 18:43.339
I got nothin'.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.672
All of these creepy things
around my head, this,

18:45.672 --> 18:47.563
the man's face
in my x-ray...

18:47.563 --> 18:48.471
Hold on a minute.

18:48.471 --> 18:51.515
Is that shadowy thing
on your face all the time?

18:52.013 --> 18:52.946
Or...

18:53.887 --> 18:56.223
Were they just there
on the day

18:56.223 --> 18:57.526
that it happened?

18:57.526 --> 18:58.499
I don't know.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.405
Ay, ok. Look, i'm going
to, uh, get a shot of you,

19:02.405 --> 19:04.153
and then i'll add the same enhancements

19:04.153 --> 19:05.416
that the blogger
kid did,

19:05.416 --> 19:06.827
then we'll see if
that stuff is still

19:06.827 --> 19:07.714
on your face, ok?

19:07.714 --> 19:08.978
-Ok.
-All right.

19:08.978 --> 19:10.832
Say, "spirit rising
from the depths."

19:17.346 --> 19:18.490
Have a good night.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.517
Good-night.
see you tomorrow.

20:25.062 --> 20:26.302
You killed her.

20:26.302 --> 20:27.914
You killed her!

20:37.379 --> 20:40.202
Wait, so now you're saying
it's not your father

20:40.202 --> 20:40.924
haunting you?

20:40.924 --> 20:42.454
I saw the ghost,
and it's definitely

20:42.454 --> 20:43.442
not my father.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.143
And i saw the trunk in
the haunting last night.

20:45.143 --> 20:46.846
How can that be?
it's a solid object.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.293
It hasn't moved since i went through it.

20:48.293 --> 20:50.114
I don't really worry
about the physics of it.

20:50.114 --> 20:51.407
I just see
what they show me.

20:51.407 --> 20:54.107
Which means the ghost
is attached to this trunk.

21:00.644 --> 21:01.416
Here.

21:02.601 --> 21:04.284
This is the ghost
that's been haunting me,

21:04.284 --> 21:06.121
and it's not my father.

21:06.121 --> 21:08.562
It's jennifer billings'
father.

21:08.562 --> 21:10.167
But why?

21:10.167 --> 21:12.305
I think he's got me confused
with someone else.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.760
Who?

21:22.008 --> 21:25.296
Don't tell me you sold it
already and now you want more.

21:25.296 --> 21:27.273
Oh, i would love more,
although we haven't even

21:27.273 --> 21:29.247
put it on display yet.
Sometime this week.

21:29.443 --> 21:31.471
I still can't believe
that you're willing

21:31.471 --> 21:32.585
to part with it all.

21:32.585 --> 21:34.236
Yeah, well,
like i said,

21:34.236 --> 21:36.533
it just feels like
it's somebody else's life, you know?

21:36.533 --> 21:38.185
You know, i was looking
through the pictures,

21:38.185 --> 21:39.699
and i saw your father.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.598
Or at least, i'm assuming
he was your father?

21:41.598 --> 21:43.938
Yeah. Yeah, he was
a handsome dude.

21:43.938 --> 21:47.743
The thing is, i think it's
possible that i've met him.

21:47.743 --> 21:48.740
Oh, no.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.733
No, he, uh, died in 1982.

21:51.733 --> 21:53.149
Oh. Sorry.

21:53.149 --> 21:55.210
Do you mind
if i ask how?

21:56.505 --> 21:57.299
Why?

21:57.299 --> 21:58.490
Well, i don't mean to pry,

21:58.490 --> 22:00.558
it's just when i was
looking at the photos,

22:00.558 --> 22:01.957
there was something
familiar to me,

22:01.957 --> 22:04.680
that maybe i'd, you know,
known him somehow.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.573
Well, it was a work.
there was an accident.

22:07.573 --> 22:10.268
I was 5, so i don't
really rember much.

22:10.268 --> 22:11.737
What about your mother?

22:14.389 --> 22:16.275
She died the same day.

22:17.681 --> 22:19.428
I was an instant orphan.

22:19.428 --> 22:22.000
Just add water
and new parents.

22:23.011 --> 22:24.894
The state took me,
but i was really lucky.

22:24.894 --> 22:26.242
I was adopted
right away.

22:26.242 --> 22:27.916
Dimples or something,
i don't know.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.706
He really loved you.

22:32.755 --> 22:34.482
What?

22:34.482 --> 22:36.660
Your father. I could see it
in the pictures.

22:37.469 --> 22:39.173
How could they
have loved me?

22:39.173 --> 22:40.514
They-- they really
didn't even get

22:40.514 --> 22:41.558
a chance to know me.

22:41.558 --> 22:42.647
The way he was smiling.

22:43.989 --> 22:45.758
And the way he was
holding your hand.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.977
Beaming, really.

22:54.476 --> 22:56.116
Why are you doing this?

22:57.245 --> 22:58.690
I'm sorry, i didn't--

22:58.690 --> 22:59.696
um, fred,

22:59.696 --> 23:00.850
could you just take
the counter

23:00.850 --> 23:01.772
for a second?

23:01.772 --> 23:02.766
I'm on it.

23:02.766 --> 23:04.987
Hey, jennifer!

23:04.987 --> 23:08.311
Jennifer, i am so sorry.

23:08.311 --> 23:10.729
No, no, no,
it's just, god,

23:10.729 --> 23:12.420
welcome to my pity party,
you know?

23:13.760 --> 23:15.839
Oh, i just hate crying.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.123
It's hard to get through
life without a few tears.

23:20.891 --> 23:23.105
Well, let's just say
i frontloaded all of mine.

23:23.811 --> 23:25.328
Have you always
had the trunk?

23:26.748 --> 23:28.797
I got it when i was 18.

23:28.797 --> 23:32.014
They put it in a trust for me,
even a little bit of money.

23:32.014 --> 23:35.020
It's funny. I can remember
their voices so clearly.

23:35.020 --> 23:38.382
I can remember lying in bed
at night and listening to them

23:38.382 --> 23:40.302
and feeling just so safe,

23:40.302 --> 23:43.965
but i couldn't, um, i
couldn't rember their faces.

23:44.576 --> 23:46.657
But you saw the pictures
in the trunk.

23:46.657 --> 23:49.131
Yeah, yeah. I just...

23:49.131 --> 23:51.848
I never found one
of my mother.

23:51.848 --> 23:55.812
There's the one of me and
my father, that one picture,

23:55.812 --> 23:58.426
that one where
his big, beefy hand

23:58.426 --> 24:00.512
is holding mine
like a fragile little twig.

24:00.512 --> 24:04.740
And this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

24:04.740 --> 24:08.528
Sometimes i swear
i can feel that.

24:08.528 --> 24:12.444
You know? I can feel his hand
take mine like, out of nowhere.

24:13.708 --> 24:14.977
Doesn't sound crazy.

24:14.977 --> 24:16.684
Not really.

24:17.593 --> 24:19.900
Look, i just
need to know...

24:21.775 --> 24:23.447
Did your dad
die underground?

24:24.684 --> 24:26.257
He worked for the gas company.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.734
He died in the street cave-in
down on the town square.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.148
Cave-in?

24:30.148 --> 24:31.799
I-- i've gotta go.

24:31.799 --> 24:34.692
No, please, is there
anything else that you rember?

24:34.692 --> 24:38.426
I remember his voice
the night before he died.

24:38.426 --> 24:40.483
He was talking to my mom in the kitchen,

24:40.483 --> 24:42.414
and he was telling her
how much he hated it

24:42.414 --> 24:43.307
down there.

24:43.307 --> 24:45.901
He said he thought
it was haunted.

25:19.420 --> 25:21.323
Hi. What can i do for you?

25:22.815 --> 25:25.472
Uh, i was just looking
for some information

25:25.472 --> 25:26.142
about something.

25:26.142 --> 25:29.724
Information on what?
I go on lunch in 5 minutes.

25:30.279 --> 25:33.964
Yeah, he's always like that.
don't let him intimidate you.

25:37.444 --> 25:39.740
Uh, it's actually about
something that happened

25:39.740 --> 25:40.919
25 years ago.

25:40.919 --> 25:41.705
And?

25:41.705 --> 25:43.835
And i was told
to come here.

25:43.835 --> 25:46.556
Look, this isn't a library.

25:46.556 --> 25:48.552
We're still trying
to get things computerized.

25:48.552 --> 25:52.207
Put your request in writing,
give me 2 to 3 weeks,

25:52.207 --> 25:53.329
i'll see what i can do.

25:53.329 --> 25:54.781
It's unbelievable.
this guy is just

25:54.781 --> 25:57.012
the laziest son of
a bitch on the planet.

25:57.012 --> 25:58.617
I mean, if i were
still working here--

25:58.599 --> 26:00.822
You're not.
Um, this is actually

26:00.822 --> 26:02.516
a specific event.

26:02.516 --> 26:04.125
Like, 1982.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.997
I can go
and find it if--

26:05.997 --> 26:10.047
Name, address, date you're
looking for, phone number--

26:10.047 --> 26:11.679
See you in 2
to 3 weeks.

26:11.679 --> 26:13.969
-Yeah.
-Right.

26:23.213 --> 26:25.019
I knew i liked you.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.281
He's going to lunch.

26:33.527 --> 26:35.210
You have to help me
find something.

26:35.861 --> 26:38.442
Yeah, well, good luck finding
anything in this place.

26:38.442 --> 26:39.890
Why is it such a mess?

26:39.890 --> 26:41.284
Ah, it's not like
they don't try.

26:41.284 --> 26:42.550
Even the lazy guy.

26:42.550 --> 26:46.398
But somehow, things just end
up getting messed up anyways.

26:46.398 --> 26:48.307
Of course, no one knows
this archive like me.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.052
What are you gonna do?

26:50.052 --> 26:52.250
Yeah, whatever. I just
have to find anything

26:52.250 --> 26:52.934
that i can

26:52.934 --> 26:54.907
on the street collapse
of 1982.

26:56.744 --> 26:58.505
You think
that's how it works?

26:58.505 --> 27:01.084
You just snap your fingers
and we do your bidding?

27:01.084 --> 27:02.464
What?

27:02.464 --> 27:05.258
They told me that you
might come around here...

27:05.258 --> 27:07.336
Asking questions.

27:08.783 --> 27:09.737
Who told you?

27:09.737 --> 27:13.839
You are so...
over your head.

27:17.196 --> 27:22.537
If i were you,
i would leave. Now.

27:22.537 --> 27:24.953
And i really
wouldn't come back.

27:26.812 --> 27:27.933
Ever.

28:30.572 --> 28:31.698
Daddy!

28:34.407 --> 28:35.983
Why did you leave?

28:37.168 --> 28:38.576
I had to go, honey.

28:40.057 --> 28:41.821
It didn't mean
i wanted to.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.233
I missed you so much.

28:45.605 --> 28:47.488
Did you miss me?

28:47.488 --> 28:49.706
Every day.

28:49.706 --> 28:51.679
I knew it.

28:51.679 --> 28:53.130
I knew it.

28:53.130 --> 28:56.206
Why did you leave us?

28:56.206 --> 28:58.253
You'll understand someday.

28:58.253 --> 28:59.922
Why won't you
help me now?

29:00.397 --> 29:02.308
Because you have
to find out for yourself.

29:02.308 --> 29:05.213
You always used
to give me a hint.

29:05.213 --> 29:07.056
With every riddle,
you'd give me

29:07.056 --> 29:08.271
one hint.

29:08.271 --> 29:10.070
Please.

29:11.445 --> 29:14.065
Ok. But just one.

29:15.279 --> 29:17.170
*** Age 15. ***

29:17.170 --> 29:18.825
What does that mean?

29:18.825 --> 29:20.692
You already know.

29:22.956 --> 29:24.215
I have to go now.

29:24.215 --> 29:26.849
No! Dad, wait.

29:26.849 --> 29:27.813
Don't go.

30:12.792 --> 30:14.306
Oh, damn it!

30:14.306 --> 30:15.115
Come on!

30:26.625 --> 30:29.303
You were told to stay away, weren't you?

30:29.303 --> 30:31.660
I don't take orders
from ghosts!

30:31.660 --> 30:35.018
Oh, but...He is
very angry with you,

30:35.018 --> 30:35.770
this one.

30:35.770 --> 30:37.421
He wants to take you down with him.

30:37.421 --> 30:39.187
I think
i'll let him.

30:39.187 --> 30:42.460
You know, there are
a lot of very angry

30:42.460 --> 30:43.940
people down here.

30:43.940 --> 30:46.709
I think it's time
i let you meet them.

30:46.709 --> 30:48.284
I'm not afraid of you.

30:48.284 --> 30:50.885
I am not afraid of you!

30:54.270 --> 30:56.177
You will be.

31:28.125 --> 31:30.659
GAS EXPLOSIONS
RIP GRANDVIEW

31:37.168 --> 31:38.915
Mom, i asked you
point blank

31:38.915 --> 31:40.707
if there was anything
you were holding back from me,

31:40.707 --> 31:41.479
and you said no.

31:41.514 --> 31:45.152
How could i possibly
know that that one incident

31:45.152 --> 31:46.260
would mean anything
to you?

31:46.260 --> 31:48.693
How about the fact
that you lived in grandview?

31:48.693 --> 31:50.450
Did you think that that was
going to mean anything to me?

31:50.450 --> 31:52.841
It was a long time ago.
It didn't matter.

31:52.841 --> 31:53.908
Of course it matters.

31:53.908 --> 31:55.840
I've been in grandview
for, like, 3 years

31:55.840 --> 31:58.310
and you never told me
that you and dad lived there!

31:58.310 --> 32:00.445
I mean, what else
are you hiding?

32:00.445 --> 32:01.365
Nothing.

32:02.689 --> 32:03.769
How did you get this?

32:03.769 --> 32:05.357
I was led to it.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.912
-By who?
-By dad.

32:07.053 --> 32:08.314
Somehow he's been helping me.

32:08.314 --> 32:11.502
Ok, i see.

32:11.502 --> 32:14.124
So he gets
to be the hero,

32:14.124 --> 32:15.626
and i am
the evil mother.

32:15.626 --> 32:16.804
Well, at least somebody
is pointing me

32:16.804 --> 32:17.948
towards the truth.

32:17.948 --> 32:21.759
It was a very
painful time in my life.

32:21.759 --> 32:22.846
Is that what
you want to hear?

32:22.846 --> 32:24.318
Is that the truth
you want to know?

32:24.318 --> 32:26.749
You were only
a few years old.

32:26.749 --> 32:28.930
We had been there
less then a year.

32:28.930 --> 32:29.670
I got out.

32:29.670 --> 32:31.923
I never wanted to think about it again.

32:31.923 --> 32:32.733
Why not?

32:32.733 --> 32:35.171
What other secrets
are you hiding?

32:36.913 --> 32:37.787
Nothing.

32:37.787 --> 32:39.168
You have to talk to me.

32:39.168 --> 32:42.031
Ok, you were with this guy
the day that he died.

32:42.031 --> 32:43.425
What else do you know
about him?

32:43.425 --> 32:46.334
Why is he haunting me,
and why is he accusing me

32:46.334 --> 32:47.977
of letting someone die?

32:52.636 --> 32:56.279
He still thinks
it's 1982.

32:59.364 --> 33:01.279
He thinks you're me.

33:02.746 --> 33:05.210
What?

33:08.840 --> 33:10.501
I killed his wife.

33:17.004 --> 33:19.448
Mom. Hat the hell
are you talking about?

33:20.123 --> 33:23.159
Your father and i had
just moved to grandview.

33:23.159 --> 33:26.645
I knew that i had this
ability to do this thing.

33:26.645 --> 33:28.672
I was trying to avoid it,
block it--

33:28.672 --> 33:29.690
ok, mom, stop.

33:31.064 --> 33:32.833
Tell me what happened.

33:37.327 --> 33:39.099
I was running errands.

33:39.099 --> 33:42.726
I was still trying
to get to know the town,

33:42.726 --> 33:44.944
to get to know the people.

33:44.944 --> 33:47.129
There was a gas line break.

33:47.129 --> 33:50.318
It happened
deep under the ground.

34:33.186 --> 34:34.054
Somebody help!

34:36.898 --> 34:38.498
Everybody's dead down there!

34:39.051 --> 34:40.547
Help! Please!

34:42.594 --> 34:43.530
Mary!

34:43.530 --> 34:46.000
I'm ok,
i'm right here!

34:46.842 --> 34:47.592
Mary!

34:57.574 --> 34:58.780
You see me?

34:58.780 --> 35:00.366
You hear me?

35:00.366 --> 35:03.351
No, i can't. Please.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.405
Am i dead?

35:07.197 --> 35:09.189
Please, please...

35:09.189 --> 35:11.473
Talk to my wife for me.

35:11.473 --> 35:15.334
She can't hear me. Please!
i have to talk to her!

35:20.184 --> 35:21.413
Excuse me...

35:22.485 --> 35:24.223
Just tell her i'm right here.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.954
Your husband--

35:27.954 --> 35:31.402
My-- my husband?
you've seen my husband?

35:31.496 --> 35:33.383
-I'm right here.
-Yes, he's--

35:33.383 --> 35:34.837
I just couldn't
tell her her husband

35:34.837 --> 35:35.728
was a ghost.

35:35.728 --> 35:36.634
He's right here.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.654
She thought i'd meant
he had made it out

35:38.654 --> 35:39.375
of the explosion.

35:39.375 --> 35:40.366
Is he all right?

35:40.366 --> 35:42.779
Jennifer, stay here.

35:42.779 --> 35:44.681
-Ray! Ray!
-She ran towards the hole.

35:44.681 --> 35:47.165
I-- i should have
stopped her.

35:58.303 --> 35:59.856
She got too close.

36:00.916 --> 36:02.578
Mom, there's no way
you could have known.

36:06.140 --> 36:08.655
I've never learned
to deal with them.

36:10.739 --> 36:12.771
Not the way
your grandmother could,

36:12.771 --> 36:14.918
the way you do.

36:17.225 --> 36:20.276
I just can't stand
to feel their pain.

36:20.276 --> 36:22.368
It stops me cold.

36:23.665 --> 36:27.442
You feel their pain,
and you help them anyway.

36:27.442 --> 36:29.901
Is that why
you left grandview?

36:31.532 --> 36:33.599
There were a lot
of reasons.

36:33.599 --> 36:35.853
I can make this
right for you.

36:37.239 --> 36:39.041
Just leave it alone.

36:39.041 --> 36:42.598
Just leave me alone.

36:55.615 --> 36:56.608
Professor payne?

36:56.608 --> 36:58.922
Who wants to know?

36:58.922 --> 37:01.772
Um, i'm justin yates.
I'm in the emerging

37:01.772 --> 37:02.823
technologies program.

37:02.823 --> 37:04.269
I was actually--
actually, i've been

37:04.269 --> 37:05.160
to some of your lectures
on the paranormal--

37:05.160 --> 37:08.284
All right.
You had me at "um."

37:08.284 --> 37:10.210
What can i do for you,
justin yates?

37:10.210 --> 37:12.313
I, uh, i run
and shame the devil.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.375
The blog?

37:13.375 --> 37:15.532
Yeah. Ok, cool,
so you know it.

37:15.532 --> 37:17.633
Yeah. You have that
rate your professor page.

37:17.633 --> 37:19.028
Whoa. Um...

37:21.162 --> 37:22.952
Yeah. Scattered
and distracted.

37:22.952 --> 37:25.286
That's what i remember
reading about me.

37:25.286 --> 37:28.849
Ok, uh, i'll make this
quick, then.

37:28.849 --> 37:30.972
I just, uh, wanted
to show you this image

37:30.972 --> 37:32.487
i took the other day.

37:33.443 --> 37:35.065
What do you think?

37:35.065 --> 37:37.750
Ahem. I think i look
scattered and distracted. Darn.

37:37.750 --> 37:40.473
No, um, i mean--
i mean this.

37:40.473 --> 37:43.408
Dude, he's like not there
in every other picture,

37:43.408 --> 37:45.161
and he just randomly
appears in these two!

37:45.161 --> 37:46.771
Justin, i'm not one
to stand on ceremony,

37:46.771 --> 37:48.273
but if you
call me "dude" again,

37:48.273 --> 37:50.350
i'm gonna have to bounce your
head off of one of these walls.

37:50.350 --> 37:55.475
Sorry. You don't think
this picture means anything?

37:55.475 --> 37:56.792
No. I don't.

37:57.531 --> 38:00.074
You know, uh,
i've been asking around

38:00.074 --> 38:01.835
about that antique
chick, melinda.

38:01.835 --> 38:04.385
People say a lot of weird
stuff happens in that store.

38:04.385 --> 38:04.926
Well...

38:04.926 --> 38:08.388
Weird stuff happens
all the time. Everywhere.

38:08.388 --> 38:10.149
Doesn't it? Maybe you have
to get your nose

38:10.149 --> 38:11.549
out of the computer screen
to learn that.

38:12.348 --> 38:13.565
I have a book for you.

38:15.447 --> 38:16.877
I'll tell you what,
justin...

38:18.192 --> 38:19.987
I'm gonna do you
a big favor today.

38:19.987 --> 38:22.050
I don't know how much
reading you do

38:22.050 --> 38:24.045
without scrolling,

38:24.045 --> 38:27.925
but they did at one time
print words on a page.

38:30.294 --> 38:31.443
Here you go.

38:31.443 --> 38:34.217
This book's gonna
change your life.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.431
DEBUNKING OTHERWORLDLY
ACTIVITY

38:37.301 --> 38:38.351
Awesome.

38:49.075 --> 38:52.900
When you die, it's like
time stops moving for you.

38:53.295 --> 38:55.220
Especially when there's
a lot of anger.

38:55.220 --> 38:56.866
It's like you're caught
in some kind of loop.

38:58.021 --> 39:00.084
I just wanted
to say good-bye.

39:00.084 --> 39:01.826
To her,
to my daughter.

39:01.826 --> 39:03.465
Why couldn't
your mother,

39:03.465 --> 39:04.791
why couldn't she
do that for me?

39:04.791 --> 39:06.504
She doesn't really accept
what she can do.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.039
But she didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

39:10.152 --> 39:12.132
Your wife was frantic
looking for you.

39:12.132 --> 39:14.188
I keep wondering
if she suffered.

39:14.188 --> 39:15.967
What she felt.

39:15.967 --> 39:18.300
What her last
thought was.

39:18.300 --> 39:20.189
I'm sure it was you.

39:24.402 --> 39:26.072
Why can't i find her?

39:26.072 --> 39:28.901
Well, if you didn't see her
right away after she died,

39:28.901 --> 39:30.429
she probably crossed over.

39:30.429 --> 39:33.784
And that's a good thing.
She went into the light.

39:33.824 --> 39:35.682
I didn't see any light
down there.

39:35.682 --> 39:38.572
What did you see?
Your daughter's--

39:38.572 --> 39:41.224
I saw things.
I heard things.

39:41.506 --> 39:43.266
It's terrible there
underneath.

39:43.266 --> 39:44.533
I don't ever want
to go there again.

39:44.533 --> 39:45.756
Yeah, but what did you see?

39:45.756 --> 39:46.441
Wait.

39:48.208 --> 39:49.887
My daughter.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.584
She...25 years...

39:52.584 --> 39:55.151
She's a grown woman now.

39:55.151 --> 39:57.700
You can feel her. That's
probably why you came back

39:57.700 --> 39:58.850
from the underground.

39:59.860 --> 40:01.971
There's only one thing left
for you to do.

40:06.060 --> 40:07.754
He wants you
to know your history,

40:07.754 --> 40:10.077
where you came from.

40:10.077 --> 40:12.625
Who the people
in these pictures are.

40:13.906 --> 40:15.544
He wants you
to know your family.

40:16.451 --> 40:17.916
That's when
she was 4.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.766
It was taken
at mt. Kisco.

40:20.964 --> 40:23.043
Her mom loved it there.

40:23.043 --> 40:26.115
This was taken
at mt. Kisco.

40:26.115 --> 40:27.854
It's one of your mother's
favorite places.

40:27.854 --> 40:30.628
Oh.
And that's her uncle jerry.

40:30.628 --> 40:33.004
He used to come home
from florida once a year,

40:33.004 --> 40:34.975
and he'd always bring her
those funny sunglasses.

40:34.975 --> 40:35.917
This is your uncle jerry.

40:35.917 --> 40:37.876
He lived in florida,
but he would come visit

40:37.876 --> 40:38.824
once a year,

40:38.824 --> 40:40.915
and he gave you those
funny sunglasses.

40:43.747 --> 40:45.609
How could you know this?

40:45.609 --> 40:47.043
How do you know?

40:47.043 --> 40:49.074
It's a long story.

40:49.074 --> 40:50.744
Let's finish this first.

40:54.687 --> 40:57.085
Tell her to go to the
last page of that album.

40:59.689 --> 41:01.664
He wants you to go to the
last page of this album.

41:05.995 --> 41:07.407
It folds out.

41:48.797 --> 41:51.127
You were 3 months old
in that picture.

41:51.127 --> 41:53.807
Your mom couldn't
keep her eyes off of you.

41:56.401 --> 41:59.749
Um, you were 3 months old
in this picture.

41:59.749 --> 42:03.519
And your mother could not
take her eyes off you.

42:39.933 --> 42:41.658
Ray billings
crossed over.

42:41.658 --> 42:43.799
He understands
what happened.

42:43.799 --> 42:45.230
He doesn't
blame you anymore.

42:47.005 --> 42:49.809
I know what
you think of me.

42:49.809 --> 42:53.414
That i'm wrong to try
and shut this out.

42:53.414 --> 42:54.657
I don't judge you, mom.

42:54.657 --> 42:57.341
I just want the truth
from you.

42:57.341 --> 42:59.613
It's the only thing
you owe me,

42:59.613 --> 43:01.301
that we owe each other.

43:04.410 --> 43:06.035
You want the truth?

43:06.035 --> 43:08.931
You need to leave
grandview.

43:08.931 --> 43:11.113
What? Why?

43:11.113 --> 43:12.715
It'll hurt you.

43:12.715 --> 43:15.578
It's not a good place
for people like

43:15.578 --> 43:16.600
you and me.

43:16.600 --> 43:18.016
No, mom.

43:18.016 --> 43:21.500
I'm not running away,
not from what i can do

43:21.500 --> 43:23.265
and not from where
i make my life.

43:29.078 --> 43:30.716
I knew you wouldn't.
