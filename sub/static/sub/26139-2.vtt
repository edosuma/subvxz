00:04.605 --> 00:06.640
*

00:17.085 --> 00:19.220
(whirring)

00:27.261 --> 00:29.463
(creaks)

00:56.224 --> 00:58.159
-(snake hisses)
-(screams)

01:00.928 --> 01:02.663
Snakes! Snakes!

01:02.696 --> 01:05.032
(Emily whimpering)

01:05.065 --> 01:06.267
(footfalls approaching)

01:09.069 --> 01:11.071
-(hissing)
-What the hell is going on?

01:12.340 --> 01:14.908
I thought
everything outside was dead.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.978
God knows how deep they went
after the blast.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.548
Maybe they came
through the sewage

01:20.581 --> 01:23.151
or the ventilation system.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.186
-(hissing)
-(Emily shrieks)

01:26.387 --> 01:28.156
Hallelujah.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.923
(whoops)

01:29.957 --> 01:32.160
Looks like
we got some fresh protein.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.994
-Won't they be contaminated?
-No.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.229
We'll scan 'em.

01:35.263 --> 01:38.098
I don't see any mutations.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.134
Boy, this looks
like good eating, huh?

01:40.168 --> 01:42.136
(Mead whoops)

01:42.170 --> 01:44.272
(Mead laughs)

01:56.116 --> 01:57.251
(silverware clinking)

01:59.787 --> 02:01.722
(bubbling)

02:01.755 --> 02:03.924
I have a rule against
eating things with

02:03.957 --> 02:05.926
no legs or too many legs.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.961
Oh, right, but you're fine
eating something with two legs.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.298
For the last time,
we didn't eat your boyfriend.

02:10.331 --> 02:14.134
Eat it or don't. No one's gonna
force it down you.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.604
Adversity makes
strange bedfellows

02:16.637 --> 02:20.040
and worse dinner companions.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.409
It's food, and we're starving.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.577
We should be grateful
for the fruits of the earth.

02:23.611 --> 02:27.615
Well, steamed snake soup
is actually quite delicious.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.650
It was the centerpiece
of a dinner that I attended

02:29.683 --> 02:31.185
at the Royal Court
in Kuala Lumpur

02:31.219 --> 02:33.187
with Gina Lolabrigida.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.423
-(laughter)
-(indistinct chatter nearby)

02:36.957 --> 02:39.227
So, who's in your office?

02:39.260 --> 02:42.296
I beg your pardon?

02:42.330 --> 02:45.199
Alarms went off before.
Someone came inside.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.001
Who else is here?

02:48.035 --> 02:51.205
All questions will be answered
in due course.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.042
Eat.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.579
(gasps)

02:58.612 --> 03:00.548
(all screaming)

03:03.150 --> 03:05.919
*

03:34.415 --> 03:36.684
*

04:11.051 --> 04:12.886
(whispering): Those snakes
were chopped up and cooked.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.455
How did they come back to life?

04:14.488 --> 04:16.557
I don't know.
There were a lot of snakes.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.692
Maybe they just missed a couple.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.161
You don't really believe that.

04:21.194 --> 04:24.031
Honestly, I'm trying not
to think about it at all.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.867
I'm more interested in whoever
Venable is hiding in her office.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.439
Just headed to the library.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.504
*

05:32.265 --> 05:35.536
My name is Langdon,
and I represent The Cooperative.

05:35.569 --> 05:39.139
I won't sugarcoat the situation.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.042
Humanity is on the brink
of failure.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.145
My arrival here was

05:45.178 --> 05:48.248
crucial to the survival
of civilized life on Earth.

05:48.281 --> 05:52.386
The three other compounds--
in Syracuse, New York,

05:52.420 --> 05:54.788
Beckley, West Virginia,
and San Angelo, Texas

05:54.822 --> 05:56.657
have been overrun and destroyed.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.127
We've had no contact from
the six international outposts,

06:00.160 --> 06:03.163
but we are assuming that
they, too, have been eliminated.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.098
What happened
to the people inside?

06:05.132 --> 06:07.200
Massacred.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.838
The same fate that will befall
almost all of you.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.339
Almost all?

06:15.175 --> 06:18.045
LANGDON: In the knowledge that
this very moment might occur,

06:18.078 --> 06:21.048
we built a failsafe--
The Sanctuary.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.983
The Sanctuary?

06:23.016 --> 06:25.719
The Sanctuary is unique.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.321
It has certain security measures
that will prevent overrun.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.123
MEAD:
Excuse me, sir.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.225
What measures?
Why weren't we given them?

06:32.259 --> 06:34.227
That's classified.

06:34.261 --> 06:38.165
All that matters is that
The Sanctuary will... survive,

06:38.198 --> 06:40.333
so the people populating it
will survive,

06:40.367 --> 06:42.536
so humanity will survive.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.505
Who are the people
who are populating it?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.740
Also classified.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.109
However, I have been sent
to determine

06:49.142 --> 06:52.212
if any of you are worthy
and fit to join us.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.748
(murmuring)

06:54.782 --> 06:56.149
LANGDON: The Cooperative
has developed a particular

06:56.183 --> 06:58.285
and rigorous
questioning technique

06:58.318 --> 07:01.421
we like to call...
"Cooperating."

07:01.455 --> 07:03.423
I will then use the information

07:03.457 --> 07:07.060
gained to determine
if you belong.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.929
What is this, The Hunger Games?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.363
This is bullshit.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.399
I paid my way in here,

07:12.432 --> 07:15.368
and that is the only cooperating
I plan on doing.

07:15.402 --> 07:18.105
You don't have
to sit for questioning.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.873
What happens
if we choose not to?

07:19.907 --> 07:23.210
Then you stay here and die.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.412
I volunteer to go first.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.815
And so you shall.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.584
The process should only
take me a couple of days,

07:30.618 --> 07:33.120
so you won't be kept
in suspense forever.

07:33.153 --> 07:36.056
For those of you
who don't make the cut,

07:36.089 --> 07:38.425
all is not lost.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.395
If the worst should happen and
feral cannibals come knocking,

07:42.429 --> 07:44.397
down one of these.

07:44.431 --> 07:49.202
One minute later, you fall
asleep and never wake up.

07:52.439 --> 07:56.209
I look forward to meeting each
and every one of you.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.631
COCO:
Well,

08:17.665 --> 08:20.300
smooth move, asking to go first.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.969
There's an old actor's adage.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.004
Either go first or go last.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.505
You're not going anywhere.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.174
EVIE:
Are you suggesting

08:27.207 --> 08:28.942
that he is going to pass me up?

08:28.976 --> 08:30.844
COCO:
You're ancient.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.146
He's looking for people
to repopulate the Earth,

08:33.180 --> 08:35.048
-not fill a bingo hall.
-You know,

08:35.082 --> 08:38.118
for someone with the mental
capacity of a three-year-old,

08:38.151 --> 08:40.621
I suppose 52 might seem ancient.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.422
COCO:
You were 52

08:42.455 --> 08:44.658
when Elvis took his last shit.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.627
-That's enough!
-EVIE: Oh, no.

08:46.660 --> 08:50.030
Let her spout.
I remember a wonderful lunch

08:50.063 --> 08:52.365
that I had at Dan Tana's
with Natalie Wood.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.602
Natalie turned to me
and she said,

08:54.635 --> 08:57.270
"Evie, you are a survivor.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.372
You're gonna outlive us all."

08:59.406 --> 09:03.176
And dear Natalie--
she turned out to be right.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.212
Hmm.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.318
(door opens)

09:14.287 --> 09:18.125
So how's this work?

09:18.158 --> 09:22.996
I'm not gonna tell you what
criteria I'm using to grade you.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.799
Things you may feel are helpful
may be hurtful.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.701
Things you may feel
will compel rejection

09:27.735 --> 09:29.737
may be exactly
what I'm looking for.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.874
So I can't game the system?

09:33.907 --> 09:37.010
If you hedge, I will know.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.012
If you lie, I will know.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.548
And if you try to trick me,
I will know,

09:41.581 --> 09:45.185
and this interview will be over,
and you will die here painfully.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.320
Are we clear?

09:49.823 --> 09:52.592
What is your sexual orientation?

09:52.626 --> 09:55.095
I'm gay,

09:55.128 --> 09:57.564
but I fucked a girl before
in high school,

09:57.597 --> 10:00.200
and I finished and everything.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.770
She did, too.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.271
I think.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.973
It's harder to tell with girls.

10:06.006 --> 10:09.109
Um... but I'm just saying
that I can do that,

10:09.142 --> 10:12.112
you know, for, for procreation
if I have to.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.181
We have techniques
for harvesting genetic material.

10:14.214 --> 10:18.518
We still need a woman's womb
to incubate the fetus, for now,

10:18.551 --> 10:21.989
but your ability to impregnate
some poor girl isn't needed.

10:23.991 --> 10:27.494
Tell me about your anger.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.197
Tell me about your grandmother.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.033
Why would you put
those two things together?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.770
(takes deep breath)

10:36.804 --> 10:39.673
Okay. I hate her fucking guts.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.474
Good.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.943
Why?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.813
Because she wants me to be
the perfect gay:

10:45.846 --> 10:48.148
married, with a pair of Yorkies

10:48.181 --> 10:49.750
and a collection
of Wedgwood dishes.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.351
-A eunuch.
-A eunuch.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.486
That's not me at all.
I'm not that old,

10:53.520 --> 10:55.288
but I'm old enough to remember
when sucking dick

10:55.322 --> 10:58.125
was both a way to get off and
an act of political rebellion.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.893
She's shamed you.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.494
In the past.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.098
What do you know?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.336
Maybe...

11:09.369 --> 11:13.974
I have a file that tells me
all your secrets,

11:14.007 --> 11:16.009
or maybe I'm sensing something,

11:16.043 --> 11:18.979
or maybe I'm just fishing.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.014
Tell me who you really are.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.853
Are you looking
for some kind of confession?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.187
I'm not a priest.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.823
I don't even know
if I believe in God.

11:29.857 --> 11:33.126
I mean, if there was a God, why
would he allow the Armageddon?

11:33.160 --> 11:36.129
The concept of sin
does seem a bit antiquated.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.833
Rules for keeping
the chaos at bay.

11:39.867 --> 11:43.003
No need for rules anymore;
chaos has won.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.643
Uh, uh, Nana,

11:50.677 --> 11:53.981
she used to throw these
bullshit suburban gay lunches.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.984
God, it was like the homo
version of The Bachelor.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.119
(light classical music playing)

11:59.152 --> 12:02.222
Walter, who was a lawyer who
represented Scarlett Johansson

12:02.255 --> 12:05.492
and had an affinity
for pleated khakis.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.727
Morris, who owned,
like, 14 dogs.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.763
And Mario Vestri,

12:09.797 --> 12:11.531
who was a manager
at Pottery Barn.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.266
Anyway, they were all dipshits.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.702
They hated her,
but they pretended

12:15.735 --> 12:19.672
to like her crappy food
and listen to her dumb stories,

12:19.706 --> 12:21.174
because they thought
that if they hooked me,

12:21.208 --> 12:23.710
they would get her money
when she died.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.079
She never told them
that she donated everything

12:26.113 --> 12:28.515
to some cat charity in her will.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.050
*

12:41.895 --> 12:45.698
Darling, that is not
proper dining attire.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.903
It is where I like to eat, Nana.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.105
* Relax, don't do it

12:52.139 --> 12:53.573
MR. GALLANT:
Is that bisque?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.542
I freakin' love bisque.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.179
* When you want to come

12:59.212 --> 13:01.114
(muffled):
Oh, yeah.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.783
Ah, bisque, baby.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.953
* When you want to go to it

13:05.986 --> 13:07.821
* Relax, don't do it...

13:07.855 --> 13:08.989
(Mr. Gallant slurping)

13:10.423 --> 13:13.360
You're pathetic.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.796
And that was the last time
she ever tried to tame me.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.999
So you like leather?

13:19.032 --> 13:21.234
I like a lot of things.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.605
Can I ask you something?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.878
Are you gay? 'Cause I'm getting
a real major hit off of you.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.846
Does the idea of that
excite you?

13:34.614 --> 13:36.616
(softly):
Yes.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.620
What are you gonna do about it?

13:55.969 --> 13:59.039
Let's continue this conversation
another time.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.373
What? That's it?

14:00.407 --> 14:03.176
How did I do?
Did I get in?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.654
(sighs) This one kiss a week
is bullshit.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.856
I know.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.625
I want to get out of here.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.094
-What are you talking about?
-I'm not gonna wait around

14:21.128 --> 14:22.729
to find out
if Langdon chooses us.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.998
And I don't exactly
trust him, anyway.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.401
I say we steal two rad-suits
and some food

14:28.435 --> 14:30.470
and take our chances
on the road.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.405
Find The Sanctuary ourselves.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.041
That is crazy.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.508
We don't...

14:35.542 --> 14:37.644
Have you forgotten
what it's like out there?

14:37.677 --> 14:40.280
Langdon made it here okay,
and he was all alone.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.882
He doesn't exactly look
like Mad Max.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.052
We don't even know
where The Sanctuary is.

14:45.085 --> 14:49.156
Maybe... there's something
in his room that'll tell us.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.223
(chuckles softly)

14:51.691 --> 14:53.193
What?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.728
There's something wrong
about Langdon.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.830
We're smarter than him,

14:57.864 --> 14:59.866
so let's fucking prove it.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.543
(distorted, echoing):
Tell me who you really are.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.948
(knocking)

15:14.982 --> 15:17.384
(exhales)
What?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.086
Come in.

15:25.825 --> 15:29.029
Oh... you pack that thing
in your luggage?

15:39.006 --> 15:43.010
Is this phase two
of the interview, or...

15:43.043 --> 15:45.845
are you just here
on your own time?

15:47.347 --> 15:48.715
(hisses)

15:48.748 --> 15:52.085
(panting heavily)

15:54.321 --> 15:57.090
I am yours...

15:57.124 --> 15:59.526
body and fucking soul.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.195
(gasps)

16:02.229 --> 16:04.297
(moaning)

16:09.936 --> 16:13.440
(grunting, moaning in distance)

16:26.186 --> 16:28.021
(grunting, moaning continue)

16:38.098 --> 16:40.967
(gasping)

16:41.000 --> 16:42.635
Oh, God.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.003
(moaning)

16:44.037 --> 16:46.039
*

17:07.960 --> 17:10.063
-(knocking)
-MEAD: Come.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.067
(door creaking)

17:16.236 --> 17:20.140
I'm so sorry, I-I never thought
I would have to do this,

17:20.173 --> 17:23.143
but I am truly at a loss.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.544
You got something to say?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.679
Well, I know that blood

17:26.713 --> 17:29.216
is thicker than water, but...

17:29.249 --> 17:32.319
(sighs):
oh, the things I have just seen.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.753
(Evie takes deep breath)

17:33.786 --> 17:36.756
I'm terribly conflicted.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.958
Because this
could totally destroy

17:38.991 --> 17:41.528
his chances of going
to the Utopia.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.863
Of course, I can...

17:43.896 --> 17:47.033
console myself
with the fact that his absence

17:47.066 --> 17:52.004
will leave an empty place
for somebody more deserving.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.308
(chuckles wryly)

18:00.380 --> 18:02.782
What did your grandson do?

18:06.052 --> 18:07.420
(door opens)

18:28.975 --> 18:30.777
Is that on?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.079
(whispers):
No, wait. What are you...?

18:34.514 --> 18:35.948
Okay.

18:38.251 --> 18:41.053
(Timothy sighs)

18:41.087 --> 18:42.389
This was sent a week ago.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.990
How is that possible?
There's no infrastructure.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.626
I don't know how he did,
but he did it.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.962
He must have
a satellite hookup or something.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.864
(taps keyboard)

18:51.898 --> 18:54.033
It's to The Cooperative
about Venable.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.135
"She has deviated
from operating protocols

18:56.169 --> 18:59.606
"and has instituted her own
rules forbidding sexual contact.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.008
Violation punishable by death."

19:02.041 --> 19:03.142
(Timothy sighs)

19:09.316 --> 19:11.318
*

19:29.035 --> 19:31.003
LANGDON:
You have a gift

19:31.037 --> 19:33.273
for making the ugly
look presentable.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.074
(Venable chuckles softly)

19:35.107 --> 19:38.010
Order on the outside

19:38.044 --> 19:41.180
does wonders to keep the chaos
safely on the inside.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.455
I'm onto you.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.659
You've created
your own rules in here.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.495
I understand why.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.130
I'm sure it was impossible
to resist the temptation

19:58.164 --> 20:00.867
of making this place over
in your image,

20:00.900 --> 20:04.170
especially when you thought
that no one who knew any better

20:04.203 --> 20:05.972
would ever be around to notice.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.974
I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.209
Complete abstinence?

20:10.243 --> 20:13.045
Punishable by summary execution?

20:13.079 --> 20:16.115
I received my orders
in an encrypted communiqué

20:16.148 --> 20:19.319
from The Co-op before all
communication lines went down.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.153
Do you have it?

20:21.187 --> 20:23.523
No, I do not.

20:23.556 --> 20:27.159
The orders were to destroy it
after I read it.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.829
Odd.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.164
I was instrumental in drafting
all of the directives

20:32.198 --> 20:34.467
in regards to the running
of the outposts.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.036
And nothing
would be more humiliating

20:37.069 --> 20:40.239
to a man such as yourself
than to learn that a woman

20:40.273 --> 20:42.509
had more information
than he did.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.046
A man such as myself?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.115
You... and the others.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.586
Masters of the universe,

20:53.620 --> 20:55.888
titans of industry...

20:55.922 --> 20:57.990
swinging your dicks around
so much that you managed

20:58.024 --> 21:00.059
to blow the whole world to hell.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.562
You're a fighter.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.734
I like that about you.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.302
I'm just doing my best

21:09.336 --> 21:11.338
with the mess
men made of things.

21:11.371 --> 21:15.708
Maybe that's what was needed
around here, hmm?

21:15.742 --> 21:17.377
Some improvisation.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.651
I'm gonna give you some
important information instead.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.686
You're the leader in here.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.488
You need to understand
what's at stake,

21:28.521 --> 21:32.158
what's really going on
out there.

21:39.165 --> 21:42.669
On the way here,
I came across a woman.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.472
A young mother
with two children.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.374
They were some
of the unlucky ones

21:47.407 --> 21:49.576
who were far enough
from the blast radius

21:49.609 --> 21:52.311
to survive the fireball but...

21:52.345 --> 21:54.313
not the radiation.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.517
They were covered

21:57.550 --> 22:00.186
in tumors.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.021
Sores.

22:02.054 --> 22:05.425
Their lungs were burnt
from the toxic air.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.796
After a few moments, I realized

22:09.829 --> 22:12.131
that the child she was carrying
in her arms

22:12.164 --> 22:15.034
was already dead.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.969
She was begging for us

22:17.003 --> 22:19.472
to murder her other child
out of pity.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.140
Mercy.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.411
She didn't have the strength
to do it herself,

22:24.444 --> 22:27.480
so she prayed for someone
to come along and do it for her.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.083
Did you?

22:32.151 --> 22:34.020
No.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.357
So...

22:38.391 --> 22:42.061
who deserves a shot
at salvation?

22:42.094 --> 22:45.532
Let's start with...

22:45.565 --> 22:48.200
Coco Saint Pierre Vanderbilt.

22:51.203 --> 22:55.442
The Vanderbilt girl is a vacuous
abomination of inbreeding.

22:55.475 --> 22:59.045
She'd be my last choice
to propagate the human race.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.949
The hairdresser
is a cowardly homosexual.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.151
His grandmother
is a festering pustule

23:05.184 --> 23:08.755
who just will not die.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.459
And the talk show host...

23:12.492 --> 23:16.162
well, actually, I don't know
that much about that one.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.997
At this rate,
it sounds like you and I

23:18.030 --> 23:19.799
will have The Sanctuary
all to ourselves.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.269
(exhales)

23:23.302 --> 23:25.071
Come.

23:25.104 --> 23:29.141
There's no need for us
to be adversaries, Ms. Venable.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.615
Take off your dress.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.416
I will not.

23:37.450 --> 23:40.887
(chuckles)

23:40.920 --> 23:44.857
Part of your cooperation
includes a physical examination.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.293
You can read my file.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.462
Your file won't show me
what I need to see.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.999
Your shame.

23:58.905 --> 24:02.775
I want to see that part of you
that humiliates you the most.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.811
(Venable shudders)

24:06.813 --> 24:09.048
You won't get a second chance.

24:30.102 --> 24:31.971
Does it hurt?

24:32.004 --> 24:34.006
No.

24:37.009 --> 24:40.012
But does it bring you
great pain?

24:46.986 --> 24:48.988
Yes.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.959
(breathing shakily)

24:55.161 --> 24:57.997
Is this part of my test?

24:58.030 --> 24:59.999
Isn't everything?

25:00.032 --> 25:03.102
So, then...

25:03.135 --> 25:05.137
do I pass?

25:10.877 --> 25:12.879
No.

25:16.148 --> 25:19.118
(knock at door)

25:19.151 --> 25:22.822
-Yes?
-I'm sorry to interrupt.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.257
I need Ms. Venable.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.862
Good evening, Mr. Langdon.

25:40.306 --> 25:43.142
Sir.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.988
Who was he with?

25:56.022 --> 25:59.025
The old bat didn't get a look
at the guy's face

25:59.058 --> 26:02.361
because he was dressed
in black latex. Head to toe.

26:02.394 --> 26:06.165
I pressed Gallant for a name,
but he won't talk.

26:06.198 --> 26:09.168
It's obvious
who this seducer was.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.570
Look around, Ms. Mead.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.172
What's different?

26:13.205 --> 26:14.540
Who's new?

26:14.573 --> 26:17.543
MEAD:
Langdon.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.179
I think they know each other.

26:20.212 --> 26:24.116
Why else would he volunteer
to be his first interview?

26:25.217 --> 26:27.153
They're plotting something.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.099
Langdon.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.169
How long have you known him?

26:43.202 --> 26:46.305
In my soul,
I've known him always.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.342
(screams)
Rip Taylor!

26:52.411 --> 26:54.080
What are you two planning?

26:58.985 --> 27:01.988
(screams)
Larry Kramer!

27:02.021 --> 27:04.023
Go on.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.158
With every crack of the whip,
I'll pay tribute

27:06.192 --> 27:08.427
to the great gay radicals
of the '70s and '80s.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.764
Their names give me strength!

27:11.798 --> 27:13.632
Oh, Greg Louganis!

27:13.666 --> 27:16.869
-(grunts)
-Again?

27:22.641 --> 27:25.311
No.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.214
He's enjoying it.

27:28.247 --> 27:32.051
Most fun I've had
since the Folsom Street Fair.

27:42.061 --> 27:45.331
LANGDON:
In seconds, we can destroy

27:45.364 --> 27:46.999
everything humanity has built

27:47.033 --> 27:50.236
over thousands of years,

27:50.269 --> 27:53.172
but we will never be free
of the desire

27:53.205 --> 27:56.843
to be cruel to our fellow man.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.377
(winces)

27:58.410 --> 28:00.112
It wasn't so bad.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.580
(winces)

28:01.613 --> 28:03.215
Could have brought out
the cat-o'-nine-tails,

28:03.249 --> 28:05.651
and I still wouldn't
have ratted you out.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.721
-Ratted me out?
-(grunts)

28:08.755 --> 28:10.022
For what?

28:10.056 --> 28:12.358
You know.

28:12.391 --> 28:15.995
For coming to my room
the way you did.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.697
In fact, all I could think about
was our time together

28:18.731 --> 28:21.133
while they were having a go
at me.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.415
I've never been to your room.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.885
Right.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.153
And that wasn't you
in the rubber suit

28:41.187 --> 28:43.155
giving it to me.
(chuckles)

28:45.191 --> 28:47.593
Let me be as clear
as I know how to be.

28:51.097 --> 28:54.566
I wouldn't fuck you if you were
the last man on Earth,

28:54.600 --> 28:56.568
and you almost are.

28:58.470 --> 29:02.174
It's not because you're not
physically attractive.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.176
It's your neediness.

29:04.210 --> 29:07.179
Your desperation

29:07.213 --> 29:09.548
to be seen and loved.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.418
The hole you need filled isn't
in your face or your ass.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.453
It's in your heart.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.828
You're pathetic.

29:21.861 --> 29:25.231
I can see why your grandmother
is disgusted by you.

29:27.033 --> 29:29.035
You don't know anything
about my nana.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.970
(chuckles)

29:31.003 --> 29:32.972
Why else would she report you?

29:33.005 --> 29:36.575
Make them do this to you.

29:36.608 --> 29:40.379
I'm sure she hoped they would
put you out of your misery...

29:40.412 --> 29:42.414
and hers.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.918
That's bullshit.

29:45.952 --> 29:49.288
She's the reason you're staring
at a death sentence.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.724
She would do anything
to increase her slim odds

29:52.758 --> 29:54.593
of getting out of here.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.129
You know she hates your guts.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.231
You're a liar.

29:59.265 --> 30:01.167
Am I?

30:03.169 --> 30:06.138
Perhaps you should go and talk
to her about it yourself, then.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.807
(door closes)

30:08.841 --> 30:10.809
(grunts)

30:10.843 --> 30:12.845
("Time in a Bottle"
by Jim Croce playing)

30:23.222 --> 30:25.191
* If I could save time

30:25.224 --> 30:27.226
* In a bottle

30:27.259 --> 30:28.827
* The first thing

30:28.861 --> 30:31.864
* That I'd like to do

30:33.199 --> 30:35.935
* Is to save every day

30:35.968 --> 30:38.237
* Till eternity passes away

30:38.270 --> 30:41.173
This song makes me
so melancholy.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.011
They used it in a very special
Hardy Boys episode

30:45.044 --> 30:48.214
where one of the Hardy Boys'
girlfriends dies.

30:50.682 --> 30:53.119
Can't remember which one.

30:53.152 --> 30:57.156
I had the biggest crush
on Shaun Cassidy.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.258
(sighs)

30:59.291 --> 31:00.792
Innocent times.

31:00.826 --> 31:03.029
Boring times.

31:03.062 --> 31:07.934
The Hardy Boys
was a very popular program.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.136
Yeah, of course it was.
You only had three networks.

31:10.169 --> 31:13.005
You know what,
this is exactly why

31:13.039 --> 31:15.307
this is so much harder
on us youth than it is

31:15.341 --> 31:16.375
for you geriatrics.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.044
You're used to only having

31:18.077 --> 31:20.846
two or three lame things
in your life,

31:20.879 --> 31:23.582
like TV networks, uh,
ways to drink coffee,

31:23.615 --> 31:25.884
sexual orientations.

31:25.918 --> 31:27.987
-Mallory, help me
with this, please.
-Dog breeds.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.589
We had at least ten different
Pomeranians to choose from.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.224
And you guys were cool
with drinking tap water.

31:32.258 --> 31:36.228
We had so many options
for everything.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.530
Dental floss, air fresheners.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.866
We didn't just order a burger--

31:40.899 --> 31:42.935
we needed to know
if we wanted turkey or veggie

31:42.969 --> 31:46.072
or that meatless kind
that bleeds like the real thing.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.440
We had at least four Chrises
that could star in a movie.

31:48.474 --> 31:49.708
How many did you have?

32:02.321 --> 32:04.923
* I've looked around enough
to know *

32:04.957 --> 32:10.296
* That you're the one
I want to go through time with *

32:12.131 --> 32:14.800
(grunts)

32:16.235 --> 32:17.803
Surprised to see me breathing,
Nana?

32:17.836 --> 32:20.506
They usually shoot people
for fucking.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.709
Or... did you not remember that
when you turned me in?

32:23.742 --> 32:25.711
No hard feelings, darling.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.214
I want to live,
and the only way to achieve that

32:28.247 --> 32:31.783
is to get rid of these
ten little Indians who stand

32:31.817 --> 32:34.086
between me and
that golden ticket out of here.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.888
Um, we're sitting right here.

32:36.922 --> 32:39.925
It's not my fault that you
can't control your carnal urges.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.728
You have lived!

32:42.761 --> 32:45.164
I... haven't.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.099
Oh, yes, you have.

32:47.133 --> 32:51.003
You have crammed
ten lifetimes of failures

32:51.037 --> 32:53.772
and screwups into your 30 years!

32:53.805 --> 32:57.109
Am I the only one
who makes mistakes? Hmm?

32:57.143 --> 33:00.012
No. But I'm always the one
that has to clean up after you.

33:00.046 --> 33:01.280
Let me see.

33:01.313 --> 33:05.051
Three stints in rehab
on my dime.

33:05.084 --> 33:07.286
Fancy lawyers
to keep you out of prison.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.288
When your grandfather
rejected you

33:09.321 --> 33:13.125
because of your perverted
lifestyle, I took you in.

33:13.159 --> 33:16.095
And what did I get back?
(chuckles)

33:16.128 --> 33:19.131
Yes, you went
and you bankrupted two salons

33:19.165 --> 33:23.202
and then you snorted
the third one up your nose.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.004
I deserve to live.

33:26.038 --> 33:29.808
I am the bridge between the past
and the future.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.277
I mean, when
those poor survivors arrive,

33:31.310 --> 33:35.013
what do they know
about culture and music and art?

33:35.047 --> 33:38.150
And I will be there
to tell them all about it.

33:39.885 --> 33:43.189
One lifetime of me
is worth 50 of yours.

33:43.222 --> 33:47.859
Humanity may be
in a sorry state,

33:47.893 --> 33:49.795
but it deserves better than you.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.563
(shuddering inhale)

33:51.597 --> 33:54.032
I should have put you in that
motion picture home years ago.

33:54.066 --> 33:56.368
The only thing
I ever wanted from you

33:56.402 --> 33:59.171
was for you to love me
and accept me.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.173
Why couldn't you
just give me that?

34:01.207 --> 34:03.775
Sorry, darling.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.878
It's just not in my nature.

34:06.912 --> 34:09.748
* Except for the memory of how

34:09.781 --> 34:11.750
* They were answered by you

34:11.783 --> 34:14.586
Well, it's a good thing you
convinced me to bring your nana.

34:17.156 --> 34:18.890
They've been making up rules
this entire time

34:18.924 --> 34:20.559
and lying to us about it.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.294
What else have they been
lying about?

34:22.328 --> 34:25.364
Are we what they say we are,
here because of our perfect DNA?

34:27.233 --> 34:29.201
(sighs)

34:29.235 --> 34:30.269
It doesn't matter.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.712
What are we doing?

34:40.746 --> 34:42.514
What we should have been doing
this whole time.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.200
("Time in a Bottle" playing)

35:01.233 --> 35:05.771
* If I could save time
in a bottle *

35:05.804 --> 35:10.776
* The first thing
that I'd like to do *

35:10.809 --> 35:13.379
* Is to save every day

35:13.412 --> 35:15.381
* Till eternity

35:15.414 --> 35:18.250
-* Passes away.
-(static)

35:22.188 --> 35:25.657
("Gold Dust Woman"
by Fleetwood Mac playing)

35:30.262 --> 35:34.633
* Rock on, gold dust woman

35:34.666 --> 35:37.236
* Take your silver spoon

35:37.269 --> 35:39.971
* Dig your grave

35:40.005 --> 35:42.241
*

35:47.579 --> 35:50.516
* Heartless challenge

35:50.549 --> 35:53.985
* Pick your path and I'll pray

35:54.019 --> 35:56.788
*

36:01.827 --> 36:05.364
* Wake up in the mornin'

36:05.397 --> 36:07.866
* See your sunrise

36:07.899 --> 36:12.037
* Loves to go down

36:13.071 --> 36:15.341
(door closes)

36:16.775 --> 36:19.010
* Well, did she make you cry

36:19.044 --> 36:20.712
* Make you break down

36:20.746 --> 36:24.182
* Shatter your illusions
of love *

36:24.216 --> 36:26.985
* And is it over now?

36:27.018 --> 36:29.120
* Do you know how?

36:29.154 --> 36:34.393
* Pick up the pieces
and go home *

36:34.426 --> 36:36.928
*

36:37.963 --> 36:39.431
(rubber creaking)

36:39.465 --> 36:42.033
* Rock on, ancient queen

36:42.067 --> 36:44.503
* Follow those

36:44.536 --> 36:47.038
-* Who pale in your

36:47.072 --> 36:48.874
-* Shadow

36:48.907 --> 36:51.009
*

36:53.912 --> 36:57.983

36:58.016 --> 37:01.320
* You'd better put
your kingdom *

37:01.353 --> 37:03.622
* Up for sale

37:03.655 --> 37:05.156
-(screams)

37:07.225 --> 37:09.728
-EMILY (crying): Stop!
-(Timothy grunts)

37:09.761 --> 37:11.997
* Well, did she make you cry

37:12.030 --> 37:13.732
* Make you break down

37:13.765 --> 37:16.502
* Shatter your illusions
of love *

37:16.535 --> 37:19.638
* Well, is it over now?

37:19.671 --> 37:21.340
* Do you know how?

37:21.373 --> 37:24.810
* Pick up the pieces
and go home *

37:24.843 --> 37:27.078
* Well, did she make you cry

37:27.112 --> 37:29.114
* Make you break down

37:29.147 --> 37:30.749
* Shatter your illusions

37:30.782 --> 37:33.018
* Of love, and now tell me

37:33.051 --> 37:35.020
* Is it over now?

37:35.053 --> 37:38.290
* Do you know how
to pick up the pieces... *

37:38.324 --> 37:41.327
Wouldn't fuck me
if I was the last man on Earth?

37:41.360 --> 37:46.765
* Go home

37:46.798 --> 37:49.000
* Go home...

37:49.034 --> 37:51.737
(muffled groaning)

37:57.108 --> 38:00.979
*

38:11.256 --> 38:13.224
* Pale

38:13.258 --> 38:16.728
* Shadow.

38:19.998 --> 38:23.802
This is extremely disappointing.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.036
You know what has to happen now.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.004
Nothing has to happen,

38:26.037 --> 38:27.973
because we haven't done
anything wrong.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.208
I explained the rules
when you arrived.

38:30.241 --> 38:32.210
Those are your rules.

38:32.243 --> 38:34.413
The Cooperative doesn't care
if we have sex.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.181
Who told you that?

38:36.214 --> 38:37.248
Langdon?

38:37.282 --> 38:41.219
He has a goddamn laptop
in his room.

38:41.252 --> 38:44.289
You have been making
all these bullshit rules up.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.858
You're sick.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.632
-(shouts)
-(grunting)

38:53.665 --> 38:54.966

38:55.000 --> 38:57.769
with the unburied corpses
of seven billion people,

38:57.803 --> 38:59.871
and all you can think about
is fornication?

39:01.473 --> 39:02.941
And I'm the sick one?

39:02.974 --> 39:05.777
Get them out of here.
Their punishment

39:05.811 --> 39:07.345
-can't come soon enough.
-No, please!

39:07.379 --> 39:10.516
No!

-Emily, Emily, I'm sorry.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.206
