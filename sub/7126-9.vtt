SAMANTHA:
<i>Since breaking up with the perfect guy,</i>

00:04.458 --> 00:06.458
<i>I've discovered plenty</i>
<i>of imperfect ones.</i>

00:06.458 --> 00:07.625
Oh, God.

00:07.625 --> 00:09.625
<i>I definitely don't fall for every guy I meet.</i>

00:11.375 --> 00:12.583
<i>But when I do fall--</i>

00:12.583 --> 00:13.792
Okay.

00:13.792 --> 00:15.458
- I'm Mike.
- Hi.

00:15.458 --> 00:16.709
<i>--I fall fast.</i>

00:23.875 --> 00:25.625
<i>And I always land hard.</i>

00:26.250 --> 00:28.125
Oh, it hurts.

00:28.125 --> 00:30.333
I just want it to stop.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.458
TODD:
Oh, trust me, you're not the only one.

00:32.458 --> 00:33.959
It's okay, sweetie.

00:33.959 --> 00:37.333
We're gonna get through this
like we always do.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.750
I think she might kill herself.

00:38.750 --> 00:41.291
SAMANTHA:
I'm not gonna kill myself, okay?

00:41.291 --> 00:44.291
I know you won't. You are strong.

00:44.291 --> 00:47.875
[WHISPERS] I'm gonna need belts,
shoelaces, and any of your ties.

00:47.875 --> 00:51.417
- I have one tie. You can't have it.
- But what if she...you know?

00:51.417 --> 00:53.166
Then I'll need it for the funeral.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.583
What is wrong with me?

00:55.583 --> 00:58.083
It's like I have absolutely
no learning curve.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.083
You know, I like-- I meet a guy.

01:00.083 --> 01:04.291
I put everything that I have
into that relationship for three weeks

01:04.291 --> 01:07.041
and then I just end up in a ball
on the floor.

01:07.041 --> 01:09.959
Too bad they didn't know you
when you gave nothing to a relationship.

01:09.959 --> 01:12.583
They might've stuck around
for four years.

01:12.583 --> 01:14.458
That's it. You know what?

01:14.458 --> 01:17.083
- No more men.
- Good. Take a break.

01:17.083 --> 01:19.125
Maybe that's it. I just need to--

01:19.125 --> 01:21.542
I just need to be single for a while,
you know?

01:21.542 --> 01:23.125
Just stand on my own.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.834
But not on a ledge, right?

01:25.417 --> 01:27.792
You know what? Just saying that,

01:27.792 --> 01:29.250
I feel better.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.375
Oh, it hurts.

01:31.375 --> 01:33.667
Oh, make it stop.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.959
Honey, I think you need to eat food.

01:35.959 --> 01:39.166
SAMANTHA:
God, Mike and I used to eat food.

01:39.166 --> 01:42.291
- What happened? She was feeling great.
- I have no idea.

01:42.291 --> 01:45.750
I just asked if there's something she was
doing to keep driving these men away.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.166
And then I guess
she thought of something really sad.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.959
I forgot. How many pairs of underwear
do I pack for a week?

01:50.959 --> 01:52.291
- Nine.
- Are you sure?

01:52.291 --> 01:54.625
Last time I packed nine,
and it was not enough.

01:54.625 --> 01:56.375
- Then pack 12.
- No, that's too much.

01:56.375 --> 01:57.917
I was thinking more like ten or 11.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.625
Sam, any thoughts on this?

01:59.625 --> 02:01.875
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
You guys are going away?

02:02.333 --> 02:03.917
When were you gonna tell me this?

02:03.917 --> 02:06.834
When I started to love you too much?

02:07.458 --> 02:10.166
I am making your father take a vacation.

02:10.166 --> 02:13.333
His doctor said his blood pressure
is sky-high.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.333
I don't want him keeling over.

02:15.333 --> 02:17.458
A vacation. That's what I need.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.875
I need to go away.
I need to go away with my family.

02:19.875 --> 02:22.667
Just get away from anything
that reminds me of Mike.

02:22.667 --> 02:23.959
Well, come on along.

02:23.959 --> 02:26.041
We were just gonna go up
to Mike Mountain.

02:26.041 --> 02:28.125
[BOTH LAUGH]

02:28.125 --> 02:29.625
Yeah.

02:29.625 --> 02:32.667
Stop. No, that's a good idea.
We'll make it a family vacation.

02:32.667 --> 02:35.583
Well, I'm game. We're going up to
that resort on Lake Wopahowie

02:35.583 --> 02:38.083
that we used to go to every year.
You loved that place.

02:38.083 --> 02:39.500
Oh, the lake resort.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.166
- Yeah, that was fun.
REGINA: Really?

02:42.166 --> 02:44.875
- You remember the lake resort?
- No, no.

02:44.875 --> 02:46.792
But sometimes that just works.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.750
Really? Your mom wants me to come?

02:49.750 --> 02:51.959
Yeah, well, I mean,
she said I could bring one friend.

02:51.959 --> 02:53.583
Just not Andrea. So, yeah.

02:53.583 --> 02:57.375
I always wanted to go with you as a kid,
but my mom was always sick.

02:57.375 --> 02:59.458
But now she's dead. Yay!

03:00.291 --> 03:01.959
- That didn't come out right.
- No.

03:01.959 --> 03:05.125
But listen, please, please, please,
don't say anything to Andrea, okay?

03:05.125 --> 03:08.542
I need to handle this very delicately, so zip.

03:08.542 --> 03:10.417
DENA:
Mm-hm.

03:11.583 --> 03:15.291
I love these giant mugs.
They make my hands look extra teeny.

03:15.291 --> 03:17.417
- Sam and I are going away.
- Dena.

03:17.417 --> 03:20.375
What is she talking about? Where
are you going with her and not me?

03:20.375 --> 03:22.834
- Nowhere that you would wanna go.
- How do you know that?

03:22.834 --> 03:25.125
- On vacation with my parents.
- Oh, ew.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.875
- See?
- Well, it doesn't mean

03:26.875 --> 03:29.625
- I wouldn't have liked to have been asked.
- I know. I'm sorry.

03:29.625 --> 03:33.166
Andrea, would you like to come
on vacation with me and my family

03:33.166 --> 03:35.458
even though it is 200 miles in a car

03:35.458 --> 03:38.250
with my dad singing
"Rhinestone Cowboy"?

03:38.250 --> 03:39.625
Thank you.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.083
Yes, I'd love to go.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.625
- What? No fair.
- Okay, shh.

03:43.625 --> 03:47.834
Listen, my mom said I can only bring
one person and I already asked Dena.

03:47.834 --> 03:49.333
And her mom's finally dead.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.500
- Lucky.
- Yeah.

04:02.166 --> 04:04.959
Dad, thanks so much for stopping,
but you know what?

04:04.959 --> 04:07.291
I don't think I can go here
so I'll just hold it.

04:07.291 --> 04:08.709
Well, this is where we're staying.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.166
Oh.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.041
I guess I'll be holding it for a week.

04:15.417 --> 04:17.709
HOWARD:
Wow, they sure fixed up the place.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.333
I know I'm a guest
and I shouldn't be nitpicky,

04:21.333 --> 04:24.166
but we're going to be murdered here.

04:24.917 --> 04:26.959
All right, girls. No complaining.

04:26.959 --> 04:29.000
That man's life
depends on this vacation

04:29.000 --> 04:32.583
and we're all going to enjoy ourselves
no matter how much drinking I have to do.

04:32.583 --> 04:36.375
You're right. I don't care
what it looks like or smells like.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.959
I'm out of the city,

04:37.959 --> 04:39.750
and away from men and heartbreak

04:39.750 --> 04:41.333
- and I like it.
BRAD: Sam?

04:42.125 --> 04:43.291
Oh, my God.

04:43.291 --> 04:45.458
I can't believe you came back.

04:46.125 --> 04:49.000
- Oh, no. He sounds cute.
- Yeah.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.542
Damn it.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.166
So, Brad, you running the place now?

05:11.166 --> 05:12.959
Yeah, since my dad died.

05:12.959 --> 05:15.792
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
He was such a nice man.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.417
Did they ever catch his killer?

05:18.792 --> 05:20.125
[DENA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

05:20.709 --> 05:22.166
Wow, look at you, Sam.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.125
And you,

05:24.125 --> 05:25.750
friendly innkeeper.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.041
[LAUGHS]

05:27.041 --> 05:28.917
Samantha, it's Brad.

05:28.917 --> 05:31.125
Little Brad.

05:31.125 --> 05:32.834
Oh, good Lord, he was your first love.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.041
- Of course he was.
- What do you mean, first love?

05:37.041 --> 05:41.291
Howard, that last summer, she showed up
late for every meal with leaves in her hair.

05:41.291 --> 05:43.458
- What did you think she was doing?
- Bird watching.

05:43.458 --> 05:46.041
She said she was bird watching
and that's what she was doing.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.834
- Now I'm gonna go unpack the car.
- No heavy lifting.

05:49.291 --> 05:52.250
I swear, you die up here,
I'll bury you right where you drop.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.417
There aren't a lot of birds here
in the winter,

05:54.417 --> 05:56.792
but there's a family of badgers
we can watch.

05:57.709 --> 05:59.583
Look, I'm sorry.

05:59.583 --> 06:03.875
I'm sure it all that bird stuff
was a lot of fun and everything,

06:03.875 --> 06:04.959
but I have amnesia.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.792
- I have the bubonic plague.
- Hm.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.792
No, I don't. No. This is-- We--

06:13.792 --> 06:16.542
Remember that game where you'd say
something that started with A

06:16.542 --> 06:18.500
and I would name one
that started with a B?

06:18.500 --> 06:19.875
No.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.917
Wow. Amnesia. Oh, I'm sorry.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.250
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.

06:26.250 --> 06:30.208
It's sort of like having a surprise party
every single day.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.792
Like finding out about us.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.583
- Surprise.
- Okay.

06:34.125 --> 06:36.917
Here are your room keys. Just settle in.

06:36.917 --> 06:39.959
And if you need anything,
don't be afraid to ask.

06:39.959 --> 06:42.792
Well, then, how about a dirty martini,
three olives?

06:42.792 --> 06:44.291
How's that for getting settled in?

06:44.959 --> 06:47.291
Yes, we no longer serve alcohol.

06:47.291 --> 06:48.792
The liquor license got too expensive.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.834
Surprise.

06:54.625 --> 06:57.333
- So he was my first kiss, huh?
- Yeah.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.917
You'd come back from your week
and tell me all about it

06:59.917 --> 07:01.542
and I'd remember every single detail

07:01.542 --> 07:03.709
because I used to write about it
in my diary.

07:03.709 --> 07:05.792
Except I'd use my name
instead of yours.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.542
Well, why didn't you warn me
about that?

07:07.542 --> 07:09.125
I didn't think he'd still be here.

07:09.125 --> 07:12.291
I mean, what grown adult
lives in the same house they grew up in

07:12.291 --> 07:13.625
and never leaves?

07:13.625 --> 07:15.625
- You.
- Oh, that's true.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.417
Andrea?

07:19.125 --> 07:21.709
Oh, my God, hey.

07:22.083 --> 07:23.750
You guys come here too?

07:24.458 --> 07:26.041
How crazy is that?

07:26.041 --> 07:27.500
Well, crazy is one way to put it.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.709
No, I come here all the time.

07:29.709 --> 07:32.583
I love it. It has mice.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.875
SAMANTHA: Hm.
ANDREA: Ew.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.417
Hey, did you see the guy
who runs this place?

07:41.417 --> 07:43.291
You know,
normally I do not go for hill people,

07:43.500 --> 07:45.000
but he was hot.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.959
That's Brad.
He and Sam used to hook up.

07:47.959 --> 07:50.417
Long ago when we were kids.

07:50.417 --> 07:52.125
And just with this part.

07:52.125 --> 07:54.125
Well, it's time to use the other parts.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.417
No, it is time to do nothing with nobody.

07:56.417 --> 07:59.959
And he is exactly the nobody
I'm going to do nothing with.

07:59.959 --> 08:02.417
Because he is cute
and we have a history

08:02.417 --> 08:04.625
and I am a sucker for that.

08:04.625 --> 08:07.041
So keep him away from me
or else he'll rip my heart out.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.542
If not him, someone will.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.959
I put your father down for a nap.
Can I--?

08:14.291 --> 08:17.458
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I can be here, it's a free country.

08:17.458 --> 08:18.959
Oh, you can't just invite yourse--

08:18.959 --> 08:20.166
Oh, wait.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.417
You brought alcohol.
You always have alcohol.

08:22.417 --> 08:23.875
Do I?

08:23.875 --> 08:25.792
Oh, it's hard to say.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.417
Come on, Andrea. Have a-- Andrea.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.208
Have a heart.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.291
My husband's dying.

08:35.291 --> 08:36.750
Oh, where'd you find this?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.417
Oh, I was poking around,

08:38.417 --> 08:41.750
looking for a secret soundproof basement
with a drain in the floor

08:41.750 --> 08:43.458
and I found fun games.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.000
Cool.

08:45.875 --> 08:49.291
Except we only have two E's, an A,

08:49.291 --> 08:51.834
and a curiously strong
breath mint with a Z on it.

08:51.834 --> 08:53.959
BRAD: Hey.
- Ew. I'm not sure I wanna touch that.

08:53.959 --> 08:55.500
Mind if I join you?

08:55.500 --> 08:58.166
Oh, no. You can.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.250
Great.

09:13.417 --> 09:15.000
Would you like a mint?

09:16.208 --> 09:17.792
[SIGHS]

09:17.792 --> 09:20.333
- Hey, Sam.
- Oh, hey, dude. What's up?

09:20.333 --> 09:23.250
What's going on?
I sort of get the feeling you're avoiding me.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.417
Avoiding you? No.
Oh, actually I was looking for you.

09:26.417 --> 09:29.250
I was. That's why I ran out here.

09:29.709 --> 09:31.792
You work here,
so, what would you recommend?

09:31.792 --> 09:33.291
Because I'm like, ooh, starving.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.875
I've been wanting
to show you something.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.750
There's only one bag of those chips
and I'm gonna stay here

09:38.750 --> 09:40.542
just to make sure
that no one else gets it.

09:40.834 --> 09:43.500
Come on. It'll take two seconds.
Come on.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.291
- Okay.
- Come on, it's right here.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.250
- Come on.
- What, you want to play tetherball?

09:52.250 --> 09:53.709
Look.

09:53.709 --> 09:55.875
SAMANTHA:
Oh, my God.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.291
Look at that.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.250
My hand was so small.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.125
We did it

10:05.125 --> 10:07.417
so they would always be one handprint

10:08.125 --> 10:09.750

just a few more fresh towels,

supposed to be relaxing.

10:49.375 --> 10:51.291
Well, I hate relaxing.

10:51.792 --> 10:56.125

I've already rocked 4,208 times.

- Yes, you were.

It had a nice oaky finish.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.667
Well, I don't know how.
I made it in a plastic garbage can.

11:13.125 --> 11:17.792
Well, the point is, what can you tell me
about fermenting these berries?

11:18.792 --> 11:21.125
Well, one,
they would probably poison you

11:21.125 --> 11:23.000

No, I didn't.
I said I didn't want to want him.

it's like if my favorite food is shrimp,

12:31.250 --> 12:32.959
so a waiter brings me shrimp.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.375
But I can't eat shrimp
because it makes my tongue swell up,

12:35.375 --> 12:36.583
so I don't eat the shrimp.

12:36.583 --> 12:40.000

grabbing shrimp off my plate

keep pushing Brad away now.
