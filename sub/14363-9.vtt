00:01.767 --> 00:04.402
[Crow caws]

00:05.392 --> 00:07.503
<i>Frankie: Christmas season
is built on tradition,</i>

00:07.504 --> 00:09.476
<i>and no tradition is more beloved</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:11.288
<i>than the family
gathering together</i>

00:11.289 --> 00:13.444
<i>to pick out the
perfect Christmas tree.</i>

00:13.445 --> 00:17.193
<i>Man on P.A.: Gary to automotive,
please. Gary to automotive.</i>

00:17.194 --> 00:18.689
Why do we have to
get a fake tree?

00:18.690 --> 00:20.478
Why can't we get a real
tree and a fake Sue?

00:20.479 --> 00:22.289
It's not my fault
I'm allergic, Axl.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.573
I feel bad enough.

00:23.574 --> 00:25.433
Look, nobody's saying
it's gonna be the same,

00:25.434 --> 00:27.358
but once you put lights
on an artificial tree,

00:27.359 --> 00:29.038
it can look very realistic.

00:29.039 --> 00:30.735
Come on. Let's just
check out our choices.

00:30.736 --> 00:32.756
We have trees with
lights already on,

00:32.758 --> 00:34.702
trees that look like
they're covered in snow.

00:34.703 --> 00:36.495
And, you know, it's
good for the environment

00:36.496 --> 00:37.549
'cause they're
made out of plastic.

00:38.127 --> 00:39.089
I like the pink one.

00:39.090 --> 00:41.552
This is the tree we're
gonna have until we die.

00:41.553 --> 00:42.738
It's not gonna be pink.

00:42.739 --> 00:45.271
Brick: Fake trees are weird.
They don't smell like Christmas.

00:45.272 --> 00:47.928
If being weird was a reason
not to take things home,

00:47.929 --> 00:49.060
we would have left
you at the hospital.

00:49.061 --> 00:50.456
<i>- [Sighs]
- You did.</i>

00:50.457 --> 00:53.674
Okay, look, we're parked in the
loading zone, so let's wrap it up.

00:53.675 --> 00:54.704
What do we think, hmm?

00:54.705 --> 00:55.792
- Sue: Sparkly one!
- Brick: Snow tree.

00:55.793 --> 00:56.185
Axl: Whatever gets
us out of here!

00:56.334 --> 00:59.760
As it's been since biblical
times, 50% off wins.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.500
You keep saying
"a" goes into "b,"

01:04.501 --> 01:05.810
but I'm telling
you, it doesn't fit.

01:05.811 --> 01:08.444
But that's because the
branches are also color-coded.

01:08.445 --> 01:11.581
Blue "a" goes into red
"b." I showed you the chart.

01:11.582 --> 01:12.697
Mm.

01:12.703 --> 01:15.652
This is so much less
joyful than killing a tree.

01:15.687 --> 01:18.347
[Sighs] I still
have so much to do.

01:18.348 --> 01:20.629
I got to run out and
buy wrapping paper,

01:20.630 --> 01:23.984
I got to get out the dancing Santa,
I got to set up the Christmas village.

01:23.985 --> 01:25.632
Although I don't
know why I bother.

01:25.633 --> 01:27.979
The only one who even notices
is Axl, and that's just

01:27.980 --> 01:30.727
so he can put the villagers
in compromising positions.

01:30.728 --> 01:32.072
- Yeah.
- Lates.

01:32.073 --> 01:32.982
Hey, where you going?

01:32.983 --> 01:34.174
And what's with the hat?

01:34.175 --> 01:37.137
If you must know, it's part
of our new business venture...

01:37.138 --> 01:40.984
"tree wise men," a subsidiary
of Boss CO. Enterprises.

01:40.985 --> 01:43.403
We're getting paid to put up people's
Christmas lights and decorations.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.995
It's the season to get rich.

01:44.996 --> 01:48.071
<i>Well, we have a tree right here,
and as soon as it gets assembled,</i>

01:48.072 --> 01:50.013
we are decorating
it as a family.

01:50.014 --> 01:52.896
Oh, but this is the only chance
I get to hang out with my friends.

01:52.897 --> 01:55.232
Now that I'm in college,
which you guys insisted on,

01:55.233 --> 01:56.720
I never get to see them anymore.

01:56.721 --> 01:58.297
Okay, but as soon
as you get back,

01:58.298 --> 01:59.764
we're making a trip
to the frugal hoosier.

01:59.765 --> 02:01.116
I'm filling two cars with stuff,

02:01.117 --> 02:02.524
and you're gonna be
my Christmas helper.

02:02.525 --> 02:03.691
Ugh. Fine.

02:03.692 --> 02:05.410
But I'm gonna need
10 bucks for my time.

02:05.411 --> 02:07.134
Oh, are we settling up?

02:07.135 --> 02:10.217
<i>Because I put a bill together for
all the things I've done for you,</i>

02:10.217 --> 02:11.995
and it's a billion dollars.

02:11.996 --> 02:13.598
[Scoffs]

02:15.117 --> 02:18.210
We hit the jackpot today
eight Christmas cards.

02:18.211 --> 02:20.654
The Kirkwoods wish us
a happy holidays and...

02:20.655 --> 02:22.719
hold on. It's got
a letter in it.

02:23.217 --> 02:25.201
It's all about their
doings and goings-on.

02:25.202 --> 02:27.351
Jackson was made captain
of the soccer team.

02:27.352 --> 02:28.943
Oh, Dale's ankle's better.

02:29.421 --> 02:30.588
Who's Dale, again?

02:30.589 --> 02:32.608
Some guy I went to
high school with.

02:32.609 --> 02:35.330
And yet he thought he should share
every detail of his life with you?

02:35.331 --> 02:37.356
Yeah, Brick. It's
a Christmas letter.

02:37.357 --> 02:40.271
People update you on their lives.
It's a way to keep in touch.

02:40.272 --> 02:43.270
- So we've gotten more of these?
- Yeah, I usually throw them out.

02:43.613 --> 02:45.176
Why? They're fascinating.

02:46.881 --> 02:48.947
Emily's engaged! They like him!

02:51.952 --> 02:53.630
Have you seen the
top of the tree?

02:54.320 --> 02:55.057
No.

02:55.058 --> 02:57.202
You didn't take it into
the bathroom, did you?

02:57.203 --> 02:59.948
Yeah, I took the top of
the tree into the bathroom.

02:59.949 --> 03:01.330
I'm just saying.

03:01.331 --> 03:02.989
I find the remote in
there all the time.

03:05.444 --> 03:07.460
Well, big work's out of the way.

03:07.461 --> 03:09.481
I'd say we've earned
ourselves a boss break.

03:10.205 --> 03:12.247
Rudolph always made
me sad, you know?

03:12.248 --> 03:14.557
They wouldn't ever let him
play any reindeer games.

03:14.558 --> 03:15.709
That's B.S., man.

03:15.710 --> 03:15.759
Hey, if you're gonna feel bad

03:15.760 --> 03:20.828
for anyone in the Rudolph special,
it's the Island of Misfit Toys.

03:20.829 --> 03:22.913
Train with the square wheels,

03:22.914 --> 03:25.604
that cowboy riding an
ostrich, King Moonracer.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.066
Man, that place is depressing.

03:27.511 --> 03:30.558
I agree with you on the depressing,
but you're wrong about King Moonracer.

03:30.559 --> 03:32.261
He was not one of
the misfit toys.

03:32.262 --> 03:34.914
Yeah, he was. He was on
the Island of Misfit Toys.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.217
Therefore, he's a toy.

03:36.218 --> 03:37.291
The lion with the wings?

03:37.292 --> 03:40.424
<i>He was the leader of the misfit
toys... he wasn't one of them.</i>

03:40.425 --> 03:42.613
So you're telling me King
Moonracer, this guy here,

03:42.614 --> 03:45.507
would willingly hang out with a bunch
of unwanted toys when he didn't have to?

03:45.508 --> 03:47.314
- Good point.
- Think about the end of the special,

03:47.315 --> 03:49.033
when Santa delivers
the misfit toys.

03:49.034 --> 03:51.757
Who's not in the bag? That's
right... King Moonracer.

03:51.758 --> 03:52.450
Booyah!

03:52.451 --> 03:53.471
I guess that settles it.

03:53.472 --> 03:55.835
Yeah, but they only show, like,
five toys being dropped of.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.532
Just 'cause king
moonracer isn't one of them

03:57.533 --> 03:58.561
doesn't mean he's not a toy.

03:58.562 --> 04:00.174
I'm pretty sure that
more than five toys

04:00.175 --> 04:01.610
get delivered on Christmas.

04:01.611 --> 04:03.622
What is your problem, man?

04:03.623 --> 04:05.335
Why do you hate King
Moonracer so much?

04:05.336 --> 04:07.204
<i>I don't hate him. He's
one of my favorite toys.</i>

04:07.205 --> 04:08.509
Stop calling him a toy!

04:11.278 --> 04:13.269
So, Jackson made
soccer in September.

04:13.270 --> 04:14.753
How'd the season go?

04:14.754 --> 04:17.070
Oh. That had to be great
for his self-esteem.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.577
Hey, is Emily there?
I'd love to talk to her.

04:20.577 --> 04:21.701
Who are you talking to?

04:21.702 --> 04:22.946
Oh, the Kirkwoods.

04:23.380 --> 04:25.350
The family who sent us
the Christmas letter.

04:25.984 --> 04:28.577
Brick, we barely even
know those people.

04:28.578 --> 04:29.928
Why would you call them?

04:29.929 --> 04:31.313
What am I supposed to do?

04:31.314 --> 04:33.269
Wait till next year to
find out what happened?

04:33.270 --> 04:35.172
That's like reading the
first chapter of a book,

04:35.173 --> 04:36.871
then waiting a year
to read the next one.

04:36.872 --> 04:39.362
Emily! What up, girl?

04:39.363 --> 04:41.007
You and Marshall set a date yet?

04:41.008 --> 04:42.574
- [Door opens]
- Hello?

04:42.575 --> 04:44.282
[Sighs] Can you believe this?

04:44.608 --> 04:47.225
They can't just give me
the top of a different tree.

04:47.226 --> 04:50.844
I got to come back here, take this
tree apart, put it all back in the box,

04:50.845 --> 04:53.379
and then haul the whole thing
back to the store and return it.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.720
Really? Did you tell them
it was just missing the top?

04:55.721 --> 04:56.184
Yes.

04:56.185 --> 04:58.171
Well, did you tell
them that's ridiculous?

04:58.172 --> 04:59.530
- Yes.
- Well, did you tell...

04:59.531 --> 05:01.342
everything you're about to
say to me, I said to them.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.576
<i>Frankie: Yep, it was beginning
to feel a lot like Christmas...</i>

05:05.577 --> 05:08.766
<i>stressful, irritating,
and overwhelming.</i>

05:08.767 --> 05:09.825
[Sighs]

05:12.809 --> 05:14.758
That reindeer looks
good over there, Axl.

05:16.046 --> 05:16.961
Yeah.

05:17.870 --> 05:20.846
Hey, Sean, you want to arrange
the bag of toys on the sleigh?

05:21.755 --> 05:22.965
Fine.

05:23.976 --> 05:26.304
<i>I know one guy who
won't be in that bag.</i>

05:26.305 --> 05:28.960
I know what you're getting at, Axl.
I'm not gonna sink to your level.

05:28.961 --> 05:31.378
I'm just saying, if we want
to be factually correct...

05:31.379 --> 05:33.365
<i>and we are professionals...</i>

05:33.366 --> 05:35.885
King Moonracer would not be in
that bag, 'cause he's not a toy.

05:35.886 --> 05:37.575
He's obviously a toy!

05:37.576 --> 05:40.691
All of the unwanted toys have some
problem that makes them a misfit.

05:40.692 --> 05:43.440
<i>His is that he's
a lion with wings!</i>

05:43.441 --> 05:44.663
Would you listen to yourself?

05:44.664 --> 05:46.400
"Lion with wings"...
where's the problem?

05:46.401 --> 05:48.066
That's not misfit.
That's just awesome.

05:48.067 --> 05:48.766
Guys...

05:48.767 --> 05:52.162
If he were a real lion with wings, he
wouldn't hang out at the north pole.

05:52.163 --> 05:54.564
He'd be flying around Africa,
picking up gazelles and eating them.

05:54.565 --> 05:56.367
Oh, there you go,
throwing around facts...

05:56.368 --> 05:57.722
"meh, meh, lions
live in Africa."

05:57.723 --> 05:59.269
You always got to
be right, don't you?

05:59.270 --> 06:00.378
That's so Donahue.

06:00.379 --> 06:02.871
It's got nothing to do
with me being a Donahue!

06:02.872 --> 06:04.136
It's about thinking
things through.

06:04.618 --> 06:06.828
You think you're so cool, you can just
say whatever dumb thing you want...

06:06.829 --> 06:08.455
people just agree
with the Ax Man.

06:08.456 --> 06:11.150
Well, guess what.
Those days are over.

06:11.151 --> 06:12.499
You're such
a know-it-all.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.731
Yeah, well, you're
a know-it-nothing.

06:13.732 --> 06:14.746
- Idiot!
- Jerk!

06:20.327 --> 06:22.149
- [Footsteps approach]
- That store was a zoo.

06:22.219 --> 06:24.559
Took me 45 minutes just
to get somebody to help me.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.804
[Sighs]

06:25.805 --> 06:27.245
What's with you?

06:27.941 --> 06:30.912
- What's the point of Christmas?
- What?

06:30.913 --> 06:32.206
I don't know if
I can do it, Mike.

06:32.596 --> 06:34.350
I think I'm done.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.977
Did you get into the eggnog
already? There better be some left.

06:36.978 --> 06:38.885
No, it's just...

06:39.415 --> 06:41.347
Christmas is so overwhelming.

06:41.348 --> 06:42.571
What is the point of it all?

06:42.944 --> 06:44.672
I get the ladder, I climb up,

06:44.673 --> 06:47.071
I drag down all the decorations,
I put them out everywhere.

06:47.072 --> 06:48.641
Week or two later, pack them up,

06:48.642 --> 06:50.661
lug them back up the
ladder, put them away again.

06:50.662 --> 06:52.665
Why do I have to go to one
store for wrapping paper

06:52.666 --> 06:54.023
and another store for bows?

06:54.024 --> 06:56.468
<i>Why can't we just use the
birthday wrapping paper?</i>

06:57.530 --> 06:59.738
It's all just so tedious.

07:01.033 --> 07:03.670
You know what?
You're just in a funk.

07:03.671 --> 07:04.691
We'll get the tree up,

07:04.692 --> 07:06.787
and you'll get in
the Christmas spirit.

07:10.504 --> 07:11.647
Are you kidding me?

07:12.002 --> 07:13.272
I got to go back again?

07:13.273 --> 07:14.770
Make sure you tell them...

07:14.771 --> 07:15.920
I know what to tell them!

07:15.921 --> 07:17.404
[Chuckles]

07:17.940 --> 07:19.164
[Sighs]

07:21.831 --> 07:23.862
- Look. Grandma sent fudge.
- Ooh!

07:23.863 --> 07:26.527
Hey, mom, I can't find the
Christmas wrapping paper.

07:26.528 --> 07:28.742
And I got Darrin that
3-foot teddy bear he wanted,

07:28.743 --> 07:30.327
<i>so I'm gonna need a lot of it.</i>

07:30.328 --> 07:33.043
You know what, Sue? I'm
not buying it this year.

07:33.044 --> 07:34.703
We have so much
birthday wrapping paper.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.595
Just use that.

07:35.596 --> 07:37.822
[Laughs] You're joking, right?

07:37.823 --> 07:40.198
I can't use birthday
wrapping paper.

07:40.199 --> 07:41.979
Well, I just don't
want to go to the store

07:41.980 --> 07:45.312
and deal with all the traffic
and the crowds and the blah.

07:45.899 --> 07:46.475
What?

07:46.476 --> 07:48.402
Don't worry. We'll
still have Christmas.

07:48.403 --> 07:50.886
I'm just not gonna get sucked
into all the trappings this year.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.154
[Door opens]

07:52.155 --> 07:55.615
Axl! Mom says she's not getting
sucked into all the trappings.

07:56.241 --> 07:56.979
What?

07:57.313 --> 07:59.190
She says she's not
doing Christmas.

07:59.191 --> 08:02.249
Whoa! Whoa!
[Laughing] Whoa, whoa.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.245
I'm pretty sure
there's a law that says

08:03.246 --> 08:05.173
<i>I have to get
presents on Christmas.</i>

08:05.174 --> 08:07.298
Relax. You're all
getting presents.

08:07.299 --> 08:08.999
I'm just not gonna
spend all my time

08:09.000 --> 08:11.514
running around
decorating and wrapping

08:11.515 --> 08:14.085
and being so miserable,
I don't enjoy Christmas.

08:14.086 --> 08:15.968
This is weird.
You're being weird.

08:15.969 --> 08:18.874
Brick, mom says she's not
getting sucked into the trappings.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.091
Tell her she can't do that.

08:20.862 --> 08:23.568
Is this 'cause you think the
holiday should be more about Jesus?

08:24.338 --> 08:27.056
S-sure. That too.

08:27.057 --> 08:28.798
But right now, for me,

08:28.799 --> 08:32.804
it's just more about laying
around and watching TV,

08:32.804 --> 08:33.950
eating my mom's fudge,

08:33.951 --> 08:36.878
and actually having fun
at Christmas for once.

08:36.879 --> 08:39.885
But you can't just, like,
lay around all Christmas.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.460
<i>Why can't I? You
do it all the time.</i>

08:42.966 --> 08:44.603
As a matter of fact...

08:48.639 --> 08:50.250
Okay.

08:50.251 --> 08:52.934
<i>There. Now, this
is the way to relax.</i>

08:52.935 --> 08:54.434
I think you're
onto something, Axl.

08:54.435 --> 08:56.342
Good god! Cover yourself!

08:56.653 --> 08:58.520
- Stop it!
- Aah!

08:58.521 --> 09:00.214
- Let me enjoy my Christmas!
- No!

09:00.215 --> 09:01.814
What is going on here?!

09:01.815 --> 09:03.684
Jill Kirkwood would
never act like this!

09:03.685 --> 09:05.613
- Let me have my Christmas!
- Axl: Behave! Mom!

09:06.795 --> 09:08.119
Hey, there. I need to...

09:08.120 --> 09:09.339
hmm.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.046
Ma'am, w...

09:12.291 --> 09:15.442
hey, hey, hey. I need
to return this tree.

09:15.443 --> 09:16.906
Oh, sure. I can
help you with that.

09:16.907 --> 09:18.354
Is there a problem with it?

09:18.355 --> 09:19.504
Yeah, I'd say so.

09:19.505 --> 09:21.475
It's supposed to
be green, but...

09:21.476 --> 09:23.549
Oh, it's pink.

09:23.550 --> 09:24.819
<i>It is pink.</i>

09:24.820 --> 09:27.896
Oh. I see what happened.

09:27.897 --> 09:29.200
See, the box was mislabeled.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.568
Yeah. I'm glad we all know the
problem. Now let's get to the solution.

09:32.569 --> 09:35.494
You know, this happened to me once
when I worked in home lighting.

09:35.495 --> 09:37.503
We got in a shipment
of wall sconces.

09:37.504 --> 09:38.498
Yeah, that's a good story.

09:38.499 --> 09:39.740
Listen, I've been to this
store three times today.

09:39.741 --> 09:41.903
I just want to get the
tree I paid for and go.

09:41.904 --> 09:43.312
So, green?

09:43.313 --> 09:44.499
Yes... green.

09:44.967 --> 09:46.471
[Beep]

09:46.472 --> 09:48.451
It looks like we're sold out
of that model in the green.

09:48.452 --> 09:49.483
I think we have one in the back,

09:49.484 --> 09:51.080
but it doesn't have a top.

09:51.081 --> 09:52.922
Yeah, I returned that one.

09:52.923 --> 09:54.777
So you don't want
that tree, then?

09:54.778 --> 09:56.523
No, I don't want
the tree I returned.

09:56.524 --> 09:59.069
[Beeping] I think we have a
couple in our jasper store,

09:59.070 --> 10:00.677
so if we do a return
on this one now,

10:00.678 --> 10:02.574
you can go pick up the
new tree at that location.

10:02.575 --> 10:03.455
- [Beeping]
- Fine.

10:03.456 --> 10:06.856
<i>Now, there is a restocking fee
because the box has been opened,</i>

10:06.857 --> 10:08.819
but you ow what...
I'm gonna waive for ya.

10:08.820 --> 10:11.033
Looks ke it's your lucky day.

10:11.034 --> 10:12.719
[Laughing] Yeah.
Feeling real lucky.

10:14.928 --> 10:16.754
Okay, something is
seriously wrong with mom,

10:16.755 --> 10:17.984
and we need to figure it out.

10:17.985 --> 10:18.927
Axl, what did you do?

10:18.928 --> 10:20.373
<i>Whoa. Why do you
think it's my fault?</i>

10:20.374 --> 10:21.675
<i>'Cause you always something.</i>

10:21.676 --> 10:23.619
Did you call her "old," "gross"?

10:23.620 --> 10:25.480
Obviously. I've been
home for two days.

10:25.481 --> 10:26.659
No, I blame Brick.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.012
He's the one who's
home all the time,

10:28.013 --> 10:29.192
and the stress of
his freakishness

10:29.193 --> 10:30.360
has probably taken
its toll on mom.

10:30.361 --> 10:33.230
Me? I raise myself
like a cactus.

10:33.231 --> 10:34.413
They hardly have to do anything.

10:34.414 --> 10:35.988
Personally, I think it's Sue.

10:35.989 --> 10:37.125
Mom's got to be cracking

10:37.126 --> 10:38.739
under the pressure of
sending her to college.

10:38.740 --> 10:40.414
She does complain
about that a lot.

10:40.415 --> 10:42.112
Yeah. I'm with Brick.

10:42.113 --> 10:44.069
That's two votes for
Sue. The Sues have it.

10:44.070 --> 10:45.455
Oh, really?

10:45.456 --> 10:46.655
<i>Well, if it's my fault,</i>

10:46.656 --> 10:49.080
why is mom sitting
around with no pants on?

10:49.081 --> 10:51.080
<i>I think we all know
who that lesson's for.</i>

10:51.081 --> 10:53.128
You know, the Kirkwoods
just went through

10:53.129 --> 10:54.270
a very similar situation
with their grandma.

10:54.271 --> 10:56.082
Jill had to put her
in assisted living.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.565
But she's very happy, though.

10:57.566 --> 10:59.517
They show "Hot in Cleveland"
in the bridge room.

10:59.518 --> 11:01.757
Okay, I change my vote.
It's definitely Brick.

11:04.416 --> 11:07.516
Hey, have you guys seen this
show "Chrome Underground"?

11:07.517 --> 11:08.783
It is awesome!

11:08.784 --> 11:11.601
These guys travel to the most
dangerous neighborhoods in the world

11:11.602 --> 11:13.135
looking to buy exotic cars.

11:13.136 --> 11:15.517
- That one is Yusuf, and...
- Yeah.

11:15.518 --> 11:18.394
Mom, um, we just wanted to
talk to you for a second.

11:18.395 --> 11:21.619
We just wanted to
say that we apologize

11:21.620 --> 11:23.317
<i>and are so sorry.</i>

11:23.318 --> 11:24.469
For what?

11:26.778 --> 11:29.650
Just a... General... Sorriness.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.463
We're gonna work on
bringing our grades up.

11:32.464 --> 11:34.231
And we're gonna
stop licking things.

11:34.232 --> 11:36.083
<i>Well, we're certainly gonna try.</i>

11:36.467 --> 11:38.866
Look, you don't have to
apologize for anything.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.277
You didn't do anything wrong.

11:40.278 --> 11:42.910
Then why don't you
put on some pants

11:42.911 --> 11:43.801
and bake cookies?

11:43.802 --> 11:47.040
[Chuckles] Hey, I am
totally pro-cookie here.

11:47.041 --> 11:48.396
I'm just not doing it.

11:48.397 --> 11:50.048
Well, how about the
Christmas letter?

11:50.049 --> 11:51.049
When are you gonna write that?

11:51.050 --> 11:53.877
Look, for years, I
ran myself ragged,

11:53.878 --> 11:56.151
but this year, I just
hit the Christmas wall.

11:56.152 --> 11:57.782
Don't let me stop you, though.

11:57.783 --> 12:00.391
If you guys want
that stuff, go. Do.

12:00.392 --> 12:02.601
<i>I'm just enjoying the not doing.</i>

12:02.602 --> 12:05.212
Oh, my god. Mom's
lost her spirit.

12:05.213 --> 12:07.342
I've heard this
happens to old people.

12:07.343 --> 12:09.821
First it's the spirit,
then it's the knees.

12:09.822 --> 12:11.611
[tires squeal] Mm, mm,
mm! Look, look, look!

12:11.612 --> 12:13.288
Now the guys are being
chased by the policía.

12:13.289 --> 12:15.239
You got to remember
In these countries,

12:15.240 --> 12:18.086
<i>sometimes the policía are
not actually the policía.</i>

12:26.941 --> 12:31.131
Well, after paying for
damages, we each made...

12:31.132 --> 12:32.543
$1.

12:35.335 --> 12:36.238
Okay.

12:36.910 --> 12:37.894
Guess that's it, then.

12:37.895 --> 12:39.998
Yep. That is it.

12:43.199 --> 12:44.542
Guys, this is ridiculous.

12:44.543 --> 12:46.189
We're not even talking
to each other now?

12:48.967 --> 12:50.580
Maybe he's right.

12:51.382 --> 12:53.749
We've been friends since we
were 4. We're like brothers.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.422
But clearly, we got to have an
answer on this King Moonracer thing.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.973
All right. Here's the plan.

12:59.974 --> 13:02.890
We sequester Darrin away
with no outside influence.

13:02.891 --> 13:05.805
He watches the entire "Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer" special,

13:05.806 --> 13:07.934
and whatever he
decides, we live with it,

13:07.935 --> 13:09.474
no matter what.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.172
Done.

13:12.590 --> 13:13.711
Wow.

13:13.712 --> 13:16.519
Our whole, entire
friendship is at stake.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.183
This is serious business.

13:19.588 --> 13:21.529
I will watch this
cartoon for you.

13:23.643 --> 13:25.067
[Car door closes]

13:26.443 --> 13:28.951
Hey, dad, I've been working
on the family Christmas letter,

13:28.952 --> 13:29.924
and I want to run it by you.

13:29.925 --> 13:31.716
Uh, not a good time, Brick.

13:31.717 --> 13:34.260
I just drove all the way to
Jasper and then to Bedford

13:34.261 --> 13:36.712
'cause they put a tree on hold
for me, which apparently means

13:36.713 --> 13:39.157
"sell it to whoever walks
in and asks for one."

13:39.859 --> 13:41.753
You know, if you can make
that a bit more interesting,

13:41.754 --> 13:43.354
I think I can squeeze
it in this baby.

13:43.355 --> 13:44.754
Here's what I got so far.

13:44.755 --> 13:47.928
"Dear friends,
merry Christmas 2014.

13:47.929 --> 13:49.101
"What a year.

13:49.102 --> 13:50.863
"Mom doesn't wear pants anymore.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.916
"She's got an unsightly
bruise on her hip

13:52.917 --> 13:54.011
"that's been there since july.

13:54.012 --> 13:55.918
"She says if it doesn't
go away in a week,

13:55.919 --> 13:57.071
"she'll go to the doctor.

13:57.072 --> 13:59.247
"Finances weigh
heavy on our minds.

13:59.248 --> 14:01.202
"The sink fell through

14:01.203 --> 14:02.874
"and now we wash

14:02.875 --> 14:05.261
"Axl's football career

14:05.262 --> 14:08.119
"as he dropped the ball... both
literally and figuratively."

14:08.120 --> 14:09.468
I'm very proud of that part.

14:09.469 --> 14:10.215
Yeah.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.111
"Mom and dad stay up
late worried about Sue

14:12.112 --> 14:14.351

Darrin called 'losing it.'"

14:14.352 --> 14:15.102
Whoa!

14:15.103 --> 14:17.674
Brick, you can't say
any of that stuff.

14:17.675 --> 14:19.451
Why not? It's all true.

14:19.452 --> 14:21.154
Yeah, well, that's exactly why.

14:21.155 --> 14:22.835
<i>Christmas letters are
just for the good things</i>

14:22.836 --> 14:24.172
that happened in the last year.

14:24.173 --> 14:25.536
Oh.

14:25.537 --> 14:27.258
Well, that's gonna
be a lot harder.

14:27.259 --> 14:28.747
And shorter.

14:28.748 --> 14:29.745
[Chuckling] Yeah.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.361
Axl, I need your help.

14:36.362 --> 14:38.943
Dad won't let me write anything
bad in the Christmas letter,

14:38.944 --> 14:40.431
<i>but I can't think
of one good thing</i>

14:40.432 --> 14:41.684
that's happened to
the family this year.

14:41.685 --> 14:43.630
Not now, Brick. We're in the
middle of something important here.

14:43.631 --> 14:45.979
Darrin wants to know
if he can rewind.

14:45.980 --> 14:47.169
[Both inhale sharply]

14:47.170 --> 14:48.904
First impressions only.

14:48.905 --> 14:50.748
Yeah, we don't want
Darrin thinking too much.

14:50.749 --> 14:51.535
Okay.

14:52.644 --> 14:54.851
So, what am I supposed
to do about the letter?

14:54.852 --> 14:57.265
I can't write anything
good, but I can't lie.

14:57.266 --> 14:59.158
Sure you can. People lie
all the time in those things.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.658
Wait... so you're
telling me 2014

15:01.659 --> 15:03.284
<i>wasn't a great year
for the Kirkwoods?</i>

15:03.285 --> 15:04.322
Maybe not.

15:04.323 --> 15:05.862
But what about the
addition to the house

15:05.863 --> 15:06.855
they built in the backyard?

15:06.856 --> 15:08.747
Probably so the dad had somewhere
to get away from the mom.

15:09.619 --> 15:11.126
Wow.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.133
I feel like I don't know
the Kirkwoods at all.

15:13.134 --> 15:15.647
[Hurried footsteps approach]

15:15.648 --> 15:18.253
Darrin wants to know if he
can reference source material.

15:19.694 --> 15:21.369
We'll allow it.

15:23.473 --> 15:26.940
Look, you sent me to Jasper.
Jasper sent me to Bedford.

15:26.941 --> 15:28.629
Then bedford sent
me to Clay City.

15:28.630 --> 15:30.924
All I know is, it's two
days before Christmas

15:30.925 --> 15:31.939
and I still don't have a tree.

15:31.940 --> 15:34.547
Just sell me the floor model,
and I'll get out of here.

15:34.548 --> 15:36.853
Oh, I'm sorry. That's tree's
just a display. I can't sell it.

15:36.854 --> 15:38.700
Why not? Because if I did,

15:38.701 --> 15:40.500
people wouldn't know we
have that tree for sale.

15:40.501 --> 15:42.201
<i>But you don't have
that tree for sale.</i>

15:42.202 --> 15:43.752
Yes, but we have a
shipment coming in.

15:43.753 --> 15:45.928
Well, how about you
sell me the floor model,

15:45.929 --> 15:46.964
then when the shipment comes in,

15:46.965 --> 15:48.503
<i>you make one of
those the floor model?</i>

15:48.504 --> 15:50.638
Whoa! That's not how
we do things here.

15:50.639 --> 15:52.238
[Sighs] All right. Let
me talk to your manager.

15:52.239 --> 15:53.302
<i>I am the manager.</i>

15:53.303 --> 15:55.066
Then let me speak
to your supervisor.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.948
Actually, there
is no one above me

15:56.949 --> 15:58.259
that you can talk
to about this matter.

15:58.260 --> 15:59.273
Really?

15:59.274 --> 16:00.653
There's no one above you?

16:00.654 --> 16:02.567
You're in charge
of the whole store?

16:02.568 --> 16:04.326
You're the C.E.O. of Homeville?

16:04.327 --> 16:06.232
At the end of the day, you
hop into your private jet

16:06.233 --> 16:07.360
and fly off to your lake house?

16:07.361 --> 16:09.038
You? Danny?

16:10.740 --> 16:12.241
I-I might.

16:16.820 --> 16:18.026
Knock, knock.

16:18.027 --> 16:19.122
Hey, Nancy.

16:19.123 --> 16:21.872
Frankie... What's going on?

16:21.873 --> 16:25.004
I've heard that you lost
your Christmas spirit.

16:25.005 --> 16:26.350
Is that true?

16:26.351 --> 16:29.383
<i>Au contraire. I have found it.</i>

16:29.384 --> 16:30.834
It's just that I noticed

16:30.835 --> 16:34.086
the geese out front aren't
dressed for Christmas.

16:34.087 --> 16:35.506
The wreath isn't on your door.

16:35.507 --> 16:37.418
I'm afraid if I go in
your guest bathroom,

16:37.419 --> 16:39.988
there'll just be regular
hand towels in there.

16:39.989 --> 16:42.994
Nancy, I'm fine.

16:42.995 --> 16:45.077
In fact, I'm great.

16:45.078 --> 16:48.919
For the first time, I am
free from the holidays.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.893
You get brainwashed
into thinking

16:50.894 --> 16:51.985
if you don't go overboard,

16:51.986 --> 16:53.459
the whole world's
gonna fall apart.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.162
I'm telling you,
it's the magazines

16:55.163 --> 16:56.561
and the papers and the malls...

16:56.562 --> 16:58.985
all a part of this
giant corporate thing

16:58.986 --> 17:00.433
called "big Christmas."

17:00.434 --> 17:01.926
Frankie, what are you saying?

17:01.927 --> 17:03.220
It was said,

17:03.221 --> 17:08.180
"unto them a leader was born
to show them a new path."

17:08.181 --> 17:11.351
Oh, nancy, take off
your pants and join me.

17:11.352 --> 17:12.519
But...

17:12.520 --> 17:16.054
<i>But you have to have the
smell of cookies baking.</i>

17:16.055 --> 17:17.211
Do you, Nancy?

17:17.212 --> 17:18.617
Do you?

17:18.617 --> 17:21.127
What about wrapping
the garage door

17:21.127 --> 17:22.752
like a giant Christmas present?

17:22.753 --> 17:25.858
The custom-made nutcracker
for each member of the family?

17:25.858 --> 17:29.053
Imagine a world where
you don't do those things.

17:29.054 --> 17:31.744
Imagine a world where you don't
stay up till 3:00 in the morning

17:31.745 --> 17:34.210
making your white-chocolate-covered
pretzel rings.

17:34.211 --> 17:35.856
What would happen, Nancy?

17:35.857 --> 17:40.852
What if you just said... "No"?

17:42.588 --> 17:43.953
I got to go!

17:43.954 --> 17:46.301
I'm caroling later!

17:46.302 --> 17:48.068
- [Door opens]
- Coward!

17:53.401 --> 17:55.745
A verdict has been reached.

18:00.543 --> 18:02.922
Gentlemen, I have
come to a decision.

18:03.255 --> 18:05.083
After considering both sides,

18:05.084 --> 18:07.788
uh, the choice became clear.

18:09.257 --> 18:10.792
He's weaseling out!

18:10.793 --> 18:11.975
Sean: Get back here!

18:15.533 --> 18:17.110
Get back here! Hey!

18:17.111 --> 18:18.948
[Grunts]

18:19.905 --> 18:20.814
No!

18:20.815 --> 18:22.688
No! No!

18:22.689 --> 18:24.274
[Grunts]

18:24.275 --> 18:26.953
- Tell us your decision!
- We need an answer!

18:26.954 --> 18:28.936
- No! I don't want to!
- If you don't, we'll whitewash you!

18:28.937 --> 18:30.705
Okay, okay! King Moonracer...

18:31.288 --> 18:32.862
Is a toy.

18:36.470 --> 18:38.254
- [Sighs]
- I'm sorry, man.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.634
No hard feelings?

18:43.437 --> 18:44.905
I just need a minute.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.629
[Sighs]

18:48.000 --> 18:54.074

<i>You're doing it wrong.
You're making a girl angel.</i>

19:06.227 --> 19:07.829
You should make a boy angel.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.997
There's no such thing
as a boy snow angel.

19:09.998 --> 19:11.223
Snow angels are unisex.

19:11.224 --> 19:12.797
Unisex? That doesn't make sense.

19:12.798 --> 19:15.224
Hey, man, he's still raw.

19:15.225 --> 19:16.778
Let him be.

19:24.175 --> 19:25.852
I think it looks really nice.

19:25.853 --> 19:27.790
Yeah. Better than I thought.

19:29.531 --> 19:31.354
I see you wrapped the presents.

19:31.355 --> 19:32.482
[Sighs]

19:32.483 --> 19:35.531
Mike, I know it was an
unconventional Christmas,

19:35.532 --> 19:38.395
but I got to say,
I really enjoyed it.

19:38.396 --> 19:40.668
Yeah, well, you needed a break.

19:40.669 --> 19:42.815
<i>I'm just happy to see you happy.</i>

19:42.816 --> 19:45.217
Aww. If there was
mistletoe up, I'd kiss you.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.884
- Mm.
- [Sighs]

19:47.885 --> 19:50.625
It's funny... for me, I always kind
of enjoyed all the Christmas stuff.

19:50.626 --> 19:51.453
Hmm.

19:51.454 --> 19:53.645
Didn't really get that
in my house growing up.

19:53.997 --> 19:57.364
I mean, after my mom died,
it was just a bunch of guys.

19:57.365 --> 19:58.456
Nobody was gonna decorate.

19:58.457 --> 19:59.590
[Chuckles lightly]

20:00.153 --> 20:01.815
In fact...

20:01.816 --> 20:05.655
I didn't really ever celebrate
Christmas until I met you.

20:08.121 --> 20:11.122
Anyway, I'm sure the
kids will be up early.

20:11.123 --> 20:12.005
I'm gonna go to bed.

20:12.006 --> 20:12.988
Mwah.

20:16.273 --> 20:18.431
Aw, crap.

20:20.365 --> 20:21.217
[Sighs]

20:30.350 --> 20:31.598
Oh, my God.

20:31.599 --> 20:33.531
It's Christmas!

20:33.532 --> 20:36.687
<i>Look! Look! The tree
It's pink and green!</i>

20:36.688 --> 20:38.623
Oh, my God. This is amazing!

20:38.624 --> 20:39.845
Mom!

20:39.846 --> 20:41.493
Oh, you got us so good!

20:41.494 --> 20:42.994
[Chkles]

20:43.755 --> 20:46.249
Hello, Mr. Mailman.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.778
Meet Miss Ice Skater.

20:47.779 --> 20:49.472
[Gasps] Have you got
a package for her?

20:50.951 --> 20:54.042
Yes! "Infinite Jest"!
I wanted this!

21:05.561 --> 21:08.942
<i>Frickin' Christmas...
It's so awesome.</i>

21:08.943 --> 21:10.901
<i>It really is the best holiday.</i>

21:10.902 --> 21:12.791
<i>Every time you think you're out,</i>

21:12.792 --> 21:14.834
<i>it just sucks you back in.</i>

21:14.835 --> 21:16.192
Who wants cocoa?

21:16.193 --> 21:17.001
- I do!
- Me!

21:17.002 --> 21:17.879
Right here!
