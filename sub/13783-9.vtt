02:01.034 --> 02:04.333
Her Majesty
awakes, huh?

02:10.844 --> 02:13.039
Cocksucker's
gonna grace me

02:13.079 --> 02:16.606
with his fucking
presence this morning.

02:16.650 --> 02:18.845
Fucking
Magistrate Clagett

02:18.885 --> 02:21.786
will impart to me the attitude towards
the settlement

02:21.822 --> 02:25.883
of him and his fellow
Iying fucking thieves

02:25.926 --> 02:28.053
at the territorial
legislature of Yankton.

02:30.797 --> 02:33.061
How fucking much
it's gonna cost us to get annexed

02:33.099 --> 02:36.865
when they sign a treaty
with the fucking dirt worshipers, huh?

02:36.903 --> 02:41.704
How hard is the legislature
gonna squeeze our balls

02:41.741 --> 02:46.542
with regard to our title
and properties, huh?

02:49.449 --> 02:52.850
I don't want to talk
to these cocksuckers, but you have to.

02:52.886 --> 02:54.979
In life,

02:55.021 --> 02:58.081
you have to do a lot
of things you don't fucking want to do.

02:58.124 --> 03:02.026
Many times, that's
what the fuck life is-

03:02.062 --> 03:05.554
one vile fucking task
after another.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.525
But don't
get aggravated.

03:09.569 --> 03:12.970
Then the enemy has you
by the short hair.

03:17.844 --> 03:20.972
It'll be different
after the annexation.

03:21.014 --> 03:23.414
That's all.

03:23.450 --> 03:25.884
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

03:27.487 --> 03:29.853
Everything changes.

03:29.890 --> 03:32.518
Don't be afraid.

03:36.863 --> 03:38.728
I can hope-

03:38.765 --> 03:42.895
those'll be appearing
on a regular basis.

03:42.936 --> 03:44.927
No.

03:44.971 --> 03:47.098
No?

03:51.711 --> 03:54.441
How's your arm?

03:54.481 --> 03:57.075
It's all right.

04:01.454 --> 04:05.049
Don't fucking try doing away
with yourself again, huh?

04:26.580 --> 04:28.047
Good morning,
gentlemen.

04:28.081 --> 04:31.050
This is Ellsworth,
who found the gold on your claim.

04:31.084 --> 04:33.746
- How do you do, Mr. Ellsworth?
- Pleasure.

04:33.787 --> 04:37.450
- And this is Sophia.
- Pleasure, Sophia.

04:37.490 --> 04:41.620
I'm gratefuI for your expertise
and keen eyesight.

04:41.661 --> 04:44.755
Luck's what you want
to congratulate me on, Mrs. Garret.

04:44.798 --> 04:46.663
Till you decide how
you want develop it,

04:46.700 --> 04:48.634
Ellsworth can spend time
enough at wages

04:48.668 --> 04:50.329
on your claim to sustain
your ownership.

04:51.638 --> 04:53.731
I nod as if I understand
what you just said.

04:53.773 --> 04:56.571
He'll explain it
all to you.

04:56.610 --> 04:59.443
Might we have a word,
Mr. Bullock?

05:06.319 --> 05:08.844
I'm certain Mr. Ellsworth's
are very capable hands,

05:08.888 --> 05:12.847
but I hope you're not
disassociating yourself from my affairs.

05:12.892 --> 05:15.793
I already got my impression
of this fellow, Mrs. Garret.

05:15.829 --> 05:17.456
This meeting's
how you form yours.

05:17.497 --> 05:18.964
I see.

05:18.999 --> 05:21.024
Then we compare notes
and decide how you proceed.

05:21.067 --> 05:22.932
Fine.

05:22.969 --> 05:26.370
Toward a future point when you tell me
my thinkin's so consistently wrongheaded

05:26.406 --> 05:29.307
it's a waste of your valuable time
having to deal with me.

05:29.342 --> 05:32.834
In any case, I know you have many claims
on your attention.

05:32.879 --> 05:35.643
A couple.

05:35.682 --> 05:37.843
Thank you very much.

05:37.884 --> 05:41.581
I'd lean more on what I felt
about this fellow than what I saw.

05:47.694 --> 05:49.286
Late as usual.

05:49.329 --> 05:52.093
I just comes from the creek, Mr. Farnum.
Washin' my pants.

05:52.132 --> 05:54.066
A habit to cultivate.

05:54.100 --> 05:59.060
And under a rock down there, I found
other pants of mine I thought I'd lost.

05:59.105 --> 06:02.836
But seein' as I gets
drunk and on occasion shits myself,

06:02.876 --> 06:05.106
I figured that must be how I lost 'em
in the first place.

06:05.145 --> 06:07.978
I imagine you making
your way from the creek,

06:08.014 --> 06:10.812
rolling into the lobby
when all others are abed,

06:10.850 --> 06:14.013
bare-ass naked with shit streaming down
the backs of your legs.

06:14.054 --> 06:17.888
Sir, no. It must have been the night
that Mr. Hickok was killed.

06:17.924 --> 06:19.551
Now I recall
that Mr. Hickok...

06:19.592 --> 06:21.822
he gives unto me a letter for me
to put in post,

06:21.861 --> 06:24.386
but what with all the hullabalo
and me gettin' drunk,

06:24.431 --> 06:26.023
I forgot about
the whole thing.

06:26.066 --> 06:28.193
Until I found
my pants.

06:28.234 --> 06:30.327
Do you think
I'm gonna touch that?

06:30.370 --> 06:32.565
No, uh, I didn't get
my pants wet,

06:32.605 --> 06:34.869
nor did I soil the letter
when I soiled myself.

06:34.908 --> 06:36.432
That's the miracle
of it, sir.

06:36.476 --> 06:39.707
So I'm to believe that's a letter
written by Wild Bill Hickok

06:39.746 --> 06:44.410
just before his murder
by the coward McCall?

06:44.451 --> 06:47.511
- Just minutes before, sir.
- Addressed to whom?

06:47.554 --> 06:50.523
His wife, sir.

06:50.557 --> 06:53.287
Well, I only hope
you haven't opened it.

06:53.326 --> 06:54.918
No, sir.

06:54.961 --> 06:58.453
At least that eliminates
tampering from the list.

06:58.498 --> 07:00.466
Of what, sir?

07:00.500 --> 07:04.527
Crimes in which your
inebriation and sloth

07:04.571 --> 07:07.938
as my employee
has implicated my hoteI,

07:07.974 --> 07:09.999
which I will attempt
to shield you from

07:10.043 --> 07:11.977
in the course of trying
to extricate myself.

07:12.011 --> 07:15.742
I didn't mean to extricate you, sir.
I- I didn't-

07:15.782 --> 07:19.878
Just give me
the confounded letter!

07:19.919 --> 07:22.012
- And none of this hangdog look.
- Sir.

07:22.055 --> 07:25.047
- Not a word of this to anyone.
- Yes, sir.

07:28.061 --> 07:32.623
Mr. Utter. Hearty congratulations
on your new venture.

07:32.665 --> 07:36.066
Take a while to find out if those
are what's in order.

07:41.441 --> 07:44.171
Being this is the first
day of my enterprise,

07:44.210 --> 07:46.041
I wore this frock-coat.

07:46.079 --> 07:47.979
Very flattering.

07:48.014 --> 07:51.245
You don't think
it looks stupid?

07:51.284 --> 07:52.979
Not to me, no.

07:54.988 --> 07:57.320
Mr. Dority all
of a sudden stumbled,

07:57.357 --> 08:01.054
and in- in grabbin'
at scrub to steady him,

08:01.094 --> 08:04.461
I saw a color beneath.

08:05.532 --> 08:08.797
Ain't you a little doll.

08:08.835 --> 08:10.598
She's formed
an instant attachment.

08:10.637 --> 08:16.007
Well, anyways, I'm glad to keep
your title good workin' the surface,

08:16.042 --> 08:20.001
but the quartz
outcrop we found-

08:20.046 --> 08:22.378
you're not gonna know
how rich your strike is

08:22.415 --> 08:24.212
until you sink
some shafts.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.411
Now, I ain't expert
prospectin' that way.

08:26.452 --> 08:28.852
I'm a man who
works in creeks.

08:28.888 --> 08:30.219
Thank you for
telling me so.

08:30.256 --> 08:34.022
Not bein' impertinent,

08:34.059 --> 08:35.857
your people gonna
help you with this?

08:35.895 --> 08:38.830
My brother and my father
are aware of my situation

08:38.865 --> 08:41.025
and my husband's
parents.

08:41.067 --> 08:44.628
I have no idea as to the prospect
of their involvement.

08:44.671 --> 08:48.937
Well, blood don't
always prove loyalty.

08:48.975 --> 08:52.308
But you're gonna need
some people on your side, Mrs. Garret,

08:52.345 --> 08:56.213
'cause I believe you got a big one
on your hands.

08:56.249 --> 08:58.877
I believe Mr. Bullock's
on my side.

08:58.918 --> 09:01.045
No question about that.

09:01.087 --> 09:03.453
And I believe
you are, too.

09:03.489 --> 09:05.821
Excuse me.

09:05.859 --> 09:07.986
I was among them
found that little girI.

09:08.027 --> 09:09.892
I'm glad to see
her doing well.

09:09.929 --> 09:12.329
I'm Alma Garret.

09:12.365 --> 09:13.525
How do you do?

09:13.566 --> 09:16.626
Ellsworth.

09:16.669 --> 09:18.000
Charlie Utter.

09:19.839 --> 09:21.466
Come in.

09:21.507 --> 09:24.374
- Yes, sir.
- You see this?

09:24.410 --> 09:28.574
"Utter Freight and Postal
Delivery Service. "

09:28.615 --> 09:31.015
That's what happens when
you drop a fucking stitch.

09:31.050 --> 09:33.917
What stitch
did I drop?

09:33.953 --> 09:35.818
I did.

09:35.855 --> 09:39.313
This freight and delivery service
should've been opened by Persimmon Phil

09:39.359 --> 09:42.021
- as a cover for his other activities.
- He's dead.

09:42.061 --> 09:44.495
I know he's dead now.

09:44.530 --> 09:47.021
Well, if you don't know,
nobody does.

09:47.066 --> 09:50.797
I should have brought in a replacement,
is my fucking point.

09:50.837 --> 09:52.566
Well, you'll know
better next time.

09:52.605 --> 09:56.041
The direction
of my thoughts-

09:56.075 --> 09:59.010
with the sustained fucking stupidity
that you're exhibiting,

09:59.045 --> 10:01.036
I hesitate to voice them-

10:01.080 --> 10:05.244
is that you might want
to train for Phil's former position.

10:05.285 --> 10:07.446
Al.

10:07.487 --> 10:10.388
I have hoped
for this conversation

10:10.423 --> 10:13.950
ever since you give me
that Indian head to hide.

10:31.110 --> 10:33.578
How'd it go with Johnny?

10:33.613 --> 10:37.743
I have just fled
my own office in horror

10:37.784 --> 10:41.345
at his fucking
dimwittedness.

10:41.387 --> 10:44.083
Well, Persimmon Phil
was no genius.

10:44.123 --> 10:45.886
I know.

10:45.925 --> 10:47.950
And Johnny, so eager.

10:47.994 --> 10:50.929
I know. Was it not my fucking
idea to ask him?

10:50.964 --> 10:54.866
There's a minimal standard,
he'll be in the wilderness.

10:54.901 --> 10:56.835
You gotta be able
to sustain a thought.

10:56.869 --> 10:59.895
You gotta be able
to remember fucking instructions.

11:02.442 --> 11:04.376
- His Honor.
- Oh, yeah.

11:04.410 --> 11:06.310
Hold fast
your valuables.

11:06.346 --> 11:09.713
Hey, Al. Any reason I can't
share with Dan

11:09.749 --> 11:12.650
the proceedings of the talk me
and you just had about me

11:12.685 --> 11:14.676
taking over
for Persimmon Phil?

11:14.721 --> 11:16.712
Yeah, keep Dan
in the dark.

11:18.891 --> 11:20.756
Have a seat,
Your Honor.

11:22.695 --> 11:24.253
- Hey, Johnny.
- Dan.

11:24.297 --> 11:26.993
What's new?

11:27.033 --> 11:29.900
I want to know how the camp stands
with the legislature.

11:29.936 --> 11:31.665
And don't give me
this, um,

11:31.704 --> 11:35.265
- "On the one hand, on the other hand. "
- All right.

11:35.308 --> 11:37.606
Just say, "This is the way
I think it's gonna be,"

11:37.643 --> 11:40.305
'cause this several- hands
fucking shit don't help me.

11:40.346 --> 11:43.645
- I'll boil things down.
- Go ahead.

11:43.683 --> 11:47.380
Let's assume for the sake
of conversation

11:47.420 --> 11:49.752
that there's a new treaty
with the Sioux peoples.

11:49.789 --> 11:52.314
"People," that's what we're calling
those cocksuckers now?

11:52.358 --> 11:53.916
That's the way
things are headed?

11:53.960 --> 11:58.090
Assuming the new treaty,
the hills will be annexed.

11:58.131 --> 12:02.033
The territory respects the statutes
of the Northwest Ordinance,

12:02.068 --> 12:06.903
which state that a citizen
can have title to any land

12:06.939 --> 12:10.705
unclaimed or unincorporated
by simple usage.

12:10.743 --> 12:13.041
Essentially,
if you're on it

12:13.079 --> 12:16.446
and you improve it,
you own it.

12:18.051 --> 12:20.781
But, what complicates
the situation

12:20.820 --> 12:22.811
is that the hills
were deeded to the Sioux

12:22.855 --> 12:25.050
by the 1868
Fort Laramie Treaty.

12:25.091 --> 12:29.050
This could mean
that the land occupied by the camp

12:29.095 --> 12:32.724
doesn't fall under any
statutory definition

12:32.765 --> 12:34.630
of unclaimed
or unincorporated.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.635
So who needs
to get paid?

12:36.669 --> 12:41.003
Signs of conciliation and willingness
would weigh in the camp's favor.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.372
But just as important
is the presence

12:43.409 --> 12:46.776
of a ad hoc
municipal organization

12:46.813 --> 12:49.611
that would enable
the legislature to say

12:49.649 --> 12:52.083
Deadwood exists,
we don't have to create it.

12:52.118 --> 12:54.382
It would be disruptive
if we did.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.047
The community's
already organized,

12:56.089 --> 12:59.286
not legally maybe,
but certainly informally.

12:59.325 --> 13:02.852
Why not let's give this
informal organization

13:02.895 --> 13:05.762
the blessing
of legal standing?

13:05.798 --> 13:08.824
What's the right fucking
number for the legislature?

13:08.868 --> 13:11.598
There's a lot of gold
out here, Al.

13:11.637 --> 13:14.231
To define "right"
in this environment

13:14.273 --> 13:17.834
is very liable to be
an ongoing process.

13:17.877 --> 13:20.004
What I'm prepared to do
is make a list of names

13:20.046 --> 13:23.072
and a preliminary guess
at some numbers.

13:30.656 --> 13:33.648
I should tell you as well
that a warrant's reached Yankton

13:33.693 --> 13:36.321
charging you with murder
in Chicago, Illinois.

13:36.362 --> 13:39.957
As the settlement's status changes,
you want to address that.

13:39.999 --> 13:41.967
I could help
with that too.

13:42.001 --> 13:44.799
How much is that
gonna cost me?

13:44.837 --> 13:48.102
$5,000.

13:51.477 --> 13:53.502
If you don't mind,
I'll continue writing.

14:12.698 --> 14:14.029
Good morning,
Miss Jane.

14:14.066 --> 14:17.035
Yeah, hello.

14:17.069 --> 14:19.037
No one croaked today.

14:19.071 --> 14:23.030
Tommy's still fucking
sick and the doc will be back

14:23.075 --> 14:26.943
I guess whenever
he fucking feels like it.

14:26.979 --> 14:30.039
See your fucking eyes
are still playin' tug o' war.

14:30.082 --> 14:33.779
Well, this is the one
to look at.

14:33.819 --> 14:38.756
Left arm still usefuI
as an old man's dick?

14:40.326 --> 14:42.726
Do I smell strangely
to you, Miss Jane?

14:42.762 --> 14:44.855
What?

14:44.897 --> 14:47.365
Do I have a strange
odor about me?

14:47.400 --> 14:50.858
What is that, your clever way of saying
you smell whiskey on my breath?

14:50.903 --> 14:52.894
No.

14:52.939 --> 14:55.237
If either of your fucking
eyes takes me for hiding

14:55.274 --> 14:57.970
I'm drinking again occasionally,
it's sadly mistaken,

14:58.010 --> 15:02.538
so desist from any clever
odor references.

15:05.751 --> 15:09.016
I thought the smell might
be coming off the creek

15:09.055 --> 15:12.024
so I went into the hills last night
but it followed me there too,

15:12.058 --> 15:16.893
as if my, uh, as if my flesh
were rotting.

15:16.929 --> 15:20.490
I, uh- do I look like a man
taken from his own grave?

15:20.533 --> 15:24.594
God damn you, don't start talking crazy
to go with everything else.

15:24.637 --> 15:27.037
Also, when I read the-
the scriptures,

15:27.073 --> 15:29.541
I do not feeI Christ's
love as I used to.

15:29.575 --> 15:32.009
Oh, is that so?

15:32.044 --> 15:33.944
That is too bad.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.744
Join the fucking club
of most of us.

15:36.782 --> 15:39.046
Let me tell you
something, Preacher.

15:39.085 --> 15:42.054
I see you skulking around
when the doc comes in.

15:42.088 --> 15:44.056
You're trying to hide
your fucking eyes,

15:44.090 --> 15:45.785
trying to hide
your fucking arm.

15:45.825 --> 15:47.725
You're a fucking mess.

15:47.760 --> 15:51.856
And I am in the process of wearing out
my own fucking welcome in this camp.

15:51.897 --> 15:54.559
And I wouldn't expect to be
around here much longer

15:54.600 --> 15:57.068
for people to be
disgusted by

15:57.103 --> 16:00.266
so they don't notice
what the fuck is going on with you!

16:00.306 --> 16:03.002
And you need to think
about some of these things

16:03.042 --> 16:06.739
and raise your nerve
to consult with the doc!

16:21.294 --> 16:25.060
God damn you! Spilling my cleaning
water too, Minister!

16:27.833 --> 16:29.892
Up.

16:33.973 --> 16:35.907
Thank you,
I'm fine.

16:35.941 --> 16:38.000
You're fine.

16:38.044 --> 16:41.377
I am off duty.
You're on duty.

16:42.748 --> 16:44.875
You can go
fuck yourself!

17:08.773 --> 17:10.605
Al, what are you
doing out?

17:10.643 --> 17:13.009
Clearing my head.
And if I blink when I speak,

17:13.045 --> 17:14.979
that's because I just
got fucking fleeced.

17:15.013 --> 17:17.881
- What's going on?
- Be at my joint in two hours.

17:17.916 --> 17:21.683
- We're forming a fucking government.
- Yes, sir.

17:31.931 --> 17:33.796
Merrick!

17:33.833 --> 17:36.996
Jesus Christ.

17:37.036 --> 17:39.004
Hey, Merrick!

17:39.038 --> 17:41.029
Cocksucker.

17:46.579 --> 17:48.877
Shoot.

17:55.654 --> 17:57.679
Thank you, sir.

17:59.425 --> 18:01.723
Good luck out there.

18:03.529 --> 18:06.430
I believe it's time
to send for my wife and boy.

18:08.634 --> 18:10.295
Treaty coming
with the Sioux.

18:10.336 --> 18:13.772
Where the fuck
is Merrick, huh?!

18:13.806 --> 18:15.296
We don't know.

18:15.341 --> 18:16.808
Well anyways,
this is it.

18:16.842 --> 18:19.003
What we spoke about before,
this puts it to the test.

18:19.044 --> 18:20.739
All right.

18:20.780 --> 18:23.874
Informal municipal organization.
Not government.

18:23.916 --> 18:25.679
No, that would
mark us rebellious.

18:25.718 --> 18:29.449
But structure enough to persuade those
territorial cocksuckers in Yankton

18:29.488 --> 18:32.924
that we're worthy enough to pay them
their fucking bribes.

18:32.958 --> 18:35.859
We're to meet to discuss
putting this organization together.

18:35.895 --> 18:38.295
Is that what
you're saying?

18:38.330 --> 18:40.298
Centuries of fucking
inbreeding

18:40.332 --> 18:44.268
attune him to the necessities
of the times.

18:44.303 --> 18:47.033
Two hours, my place!

18:52.077 --> 18:55.342
Did a fucking
good job here.

19:07.526 --> 19:09.494
Your room's
put back together.

19:09.528 --> 19:11.519
That ain't
my room anymore.

19:14.033 --> 19:17.002
Cy needn't have done
for them kids that way.

19:17.036 --> 19:19.004
Not in your room,

19:19.038 --> 19:20.630
not in the way
he did for them.

19:20.673 --> 19:22.607
I'm getting
outta here, Eddie.

19:22.641 --> 19:24.632
Are ya?

19:25.878 --> 19:28.608
I'm going to open
my own place.

19:28.647 --> 19:31.639
Good for you, honey.
Have you saved money?

19:31.684 --> 19:33.982
I got a way
to work it.

19:34.019 --> 19:36.954
I know you'll get
a long way away from here first.

19:36.989 --> 19:39.014
You think I have to?

19:42.061 --> 19:45.326
Cy told me he'd help me
open a place here.

19:45.364 --> 19:47.889
He promised he'd
keep his distance.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.400
Good.

19:49.435 --> 19:52.563
- Is he around?
- Asleep.

19:52.605 --> 19:53.970
There's a meeting
in my place

19:54.006 --> 19:55.974
in a couple of hours
he'll want to be awake for.

19:56.008 --> 19:58.704
All the pillars of the fucking camp.
You mind?

19:58.744 --> 20:00.974
You could use
some rest.

20:01.013 --> 20:03.846
I could use
a clean conscience.

20:03.883 --> 20:06.010
So could we all.

20:11.090 --> 20:13.354
Blah!

20:13.392 --> 20:15.622
Where the fuck
have you been?!

20:15.661 --> 20:19.256
- As you see.
- As I see, what?

20:19.298 --> 20:22.756
At my storage cabinet,
replentishing needed supplies.

20:22.801 --> 20:26.567
Be over in a couple of hours. We gotta
form a government for the settlement.

20:26.605 --> 20:27.731
Who does?

20:27.773 --> 20:29.866
Us! You and me.

20:29.909 --> 20:32.969
Come to me in a vision!
You stupid bastard.

20:41.720 --> 20:45.622
Anyways, I'm going
to look for a place.

20:56.535 --> 20:58.867
Eddie.

20:58.904 --> 21:02.601
Swearengen's called a meeting.
Two hours.

21:02.641 --> 21:06.338
Where's Joanie?

21:06.378 --> 21:09.347
Out looking for a place.

21:10.883 --> 21:12.817
Good.

21:12.851 --> 21:15.547
'Cause I told Joanie I'd back her
in having her own joint.

21:15.588 --> 21:16.953
That's what she said.

21:16.989 --> 21:19.116
Something on
your mind, Eddie?

21:19.158 --> 21:21.490
You fucked me up, Cy.

21:21.527 --> 21:23.654
The shit you did
to those kids,

21:23.696 --> 21:25.323
there's no angle to it.

21:25.364 --> 21:28.629
That shit wasn't just
about those kids, Eddie.

21:28.667 --> 21:32.103
You need to sit there and tough
your way through your problem.

21:32.137 --> 21:33.832
Just keep
shuffling your cards

21:33.872 --> 21:36.363
and let your tie hang down
till you feeI better.

21:38.844 --> 21:40.607
I want to come
to that meeting.

21:41.780 --> 21:44.647
Do ya?

21:44.683 --> 21:46.913
Come ahead, Eddie.

21:46.952 --> 21:48.920
Put the cards down,
tighten your cravat

21:48.954 --> 21:51.479
and come on if it'll cheer
you the fuck up.

23:04.463 --> 23:05.930
Mornin'.

23:05.964 --> 23:08.159
Good morning.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.395
I'm opening
this business.

23:13.172 --> 23:14.605
Well, good luck.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.608
Thank you.

23:16.642 --> 23:18.405
I'm Charlie Utter.

23:18.444 --> 23:20.912
I'm Joanie Stubbs.

23:20.946 --> 23:24.746
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Charlie?

23:24.783 --> 23:29.345
Ooh, I was out of breath,
but now I'm better.

23:29.388 --> 23:31.618
Are you off someplace?

23:31.657 --> 23:33.352
Uh, you need an escort
or the like?

23:33.392 --> 23:37.795
No, I'm more or less
just walking around.

23:40.065 --> 23:42.499
What do you think
of this frock-coat?

23:46.939 --> 23:49.965
Very well fitted.

23:50.008 --> 23:53.034
I had it made
up in Cheyenne.

23:53.078 --> 23:55.478
I'm one for a good
appearance and all,

23:55.514 --> 23:59.041
but it's a little
out of my path.

23:59.084 --> 24:01.109
If you would have
made me guess,

24:01.153 --> 24:03.383
I would have said
it's not your usual garb.

24:03.422 --> 24:06.619
And I'm a considerable hand
at the freight business,

24:06.658 --> 24:10.890
but far as leasing
this building

24:10.929 --> 24:13.955
before knowing what
the traffic's gonna bear,

24:13.999 --> 24:17.594
I don't know
what possessed me.

24:17.636 --> 24:20.867
See, I-
I do well in a camp

24:20.906 --> 24:23.773
or a settlement
or a township,

24:23.809 --> 24:27.074
but that don't
make me a camp

24:27.112 --> 24:29.910
or a settlement
or a township type.

24:32.251 --> 24:36.915
This is the attire
for that type of type.

24:36.955 --> 24:40.186
Anyway, you're
wearing it today.

24:40.225 --> 24:42.193
You're right.

24:42.227 --> 24:43.990
I'm sorry for running
on about it.

24:44.029 --> 24:46.862
I'm looking for a piece
of property

24:46.899 --> 24:48.867
to start a business on.

24:48.901 --> 24:50.198
That's what
I'm doing out.

24:50.235 --> 24:52.635
I see.

24:52.671 --> 24:55.299
And what sort of business
you looking to operate?

24:55.340 --> 24:58.332
- BrotheI.
- Uh-huh.

24:58.377 --> 25:01.278
Well, uh, I'll tell you what,
this camp here,

25:01.313 --> 25:03.304
it seems like
it's got some legs under it.

25:03.348 --> 25:05.475
I'm just a whore, though.

25:07.452 --> 25:10.478
I mean, I run the whores
for this man,

25:10.522 --> 25:13.457
but far as being
ready to run a place

25:13.492 --> 25:16.689
and stand up to all
you have to stand up to,

25:16.728 --> 25:18.286
I- I don't know
what got into me.

25:18.330 --> 25:21.299
I'll tell you what,

25:21.333 --> 25:25.269
something's ready
for you to do something,

25:25.304 --> 25:28.899
don't seem to matter
if you're ready or not.

25:28.941 --> 25:31.876
Better lift
your skirts and...

25:31.910 --> 25:34.674
jump, huh?

25:34.713 --> 25:39.150
That's what's coming
to me to be true.

25:39.184 --> 25:41.880
I'm surprised you're not
at that big town meeting.

25:41.920 --> 25:45.822
Uh, yeah, well,
I'm, uh-

25:45.858 --> 25:48.520
I'm heading
over there shortly.

25:48.560 --> 25:54.055
Uh, I prefer to appear
late to that type of thing.

25:54.099 --> 25:57.296
Bella Union,
where I work, is bigger

25:57.336 --> 25:59.634
but I guess being that
it's Mr. Swearengen's meeting,

25:59.671 --> 26:02.435
that's why they're
having it at The Gem.

26:02.474 --> 26:07.002
Yeah, that's- that's
why it's located there.

26:07.045 --> 26:09.741
Yeah.

26:09.781 --> 26:12.875
It's awfuI nice
to meet you, Charlie.

26:12.918 --> 26:16.945
Well it's good
to meet you, too, Joanie.

26:19.324 --> 26:21.884
Take care.

26:39.611 --> 26:42.375
I'm going to The Gem.

26:53.692 --> 26:56.024
I'm heading on.

27:12.210 --> 27:15.179
I'm heading
for The Gem.

27:15.213 --> 27:17.511
Hooray for you.

27:17.549 --> 27:21.747
Reverend is laid down
trying to hide another seizure.

27:21.787 --> 27:25.348
Ain't you clever to see
through the subterfuge.

27:27.326 --> 27:30.227
I been letting it go,

27:30.262 --> 27:34.198
but if the idea is for you to drink more
and more till I say something,

27:34.232 --> 27:36.666
I am hereby
officially saying

27:36.702 --> 27:40.263
I wish you would
stop fucking drinking.

27:40.305 --> 27:44.605
I have no fucking idea

27:44.643 --> 27:47.271
as far as you saying
one fucking thing

27:47.312 --> 27:50.110
about anything
I do or don't,

27:50.148 --> 27:52.548
far as drinking

27:52.584 --> 27:55.075
or where I stand
or nap

27:55.120 --> 27:58.180
- or any other thing concerning me.
- I see.

27:58.223 --> 28:02.091
Or go or leave
or don't or when.

28:02.127 --> 28:03.958
All right, Jane.

28:03.996 --> 28:05.793
So you can go
fuck yourself.

28:05.831 --> 28:09.267
And don't try
and hasten anyone anywhere,

28:09.301 --> 28:11.826
'cause everyone follows
their own fucking pace,

28:11.870 --> 28:14.896
and don't try
and fucking hasten them.

28:14.940 --> 28:18.808
And you happen to be
fucking overlooking

28:18.844 --> 28:22.803
that you think it's just
one day after another

28:22.848 --> 28:25.408
with the same
fucking seizure

28:25.450 --> 28:27.850
as if it happened
the week before.

28:27.886 --> 28:31.151
And that just shows
how much you fucking know

28:31.189 --> 28:34.488
and what you
pay attention to.

28:35.961 --> 28:38.691
God damn you!

28:55.647 --> 28:59.048
What do they pay you
to hold that building up?

28:59.084 --> 29:01.211
Charlie Utter

29:01.253 --> 29:05.121
of "Utter Charlie
and Freight. "

29:05.157 --> 29:08.786
It's enough to get you
off with a position.

29:08.827 --> 29:10.727
I'm in a position,

29:10.762 --> 29:14.129
you eternally meddling
cocksucker.

29:14.166 --> 29:18.660
Yeah, leaning forward,
shit-faced drunk.

29:18.703 --> 29:23.640
I am talking about
nursing the plague.

29:23.675 --> 29:26.667
Fucking tent operation.

29:26.711 --> 29:29.805
Caring of the sick
in the fucking tent!

29:29.848 --> 29:33.011
How about bullwhacker
of the fucking freight

29:33.051 --> 29:34.712
between Deadwood
and Cheyenne?

29:34.753 --> 29:36.414
No.

29:36.455 --> 29:40.118
How about supervisor,
mail delivery?

29:40.158 --> 29:42.058
Go away, Charlie.

29:42.094 --> 29:44.062
Or any fucking thing
else you want to do.

29:44.096 --> 29:46.121
Go away!

29:48.467 --> 29:52.403
Congratulations on being
a big fucking deal.

29:55.674 --> 29:59.075
No one's any big
fucking deal, Jane.

29:59.111 --> 30:02.569
And all them
offers stand.

30:02.614 --> 30:08.075
I've seen you in some stupid
fucking outfits in my time,

30:08.120 --> 30:11.851
but that one
takes the prize.

30:25.036 --> 30:28.767
I think that this month

30:28.807 --> 30:31.867
we're gonna try
raspberry leaf.

30:31.910 --> 30:34.538
Thanks, Doc.

30:36.181 --> 30:39.639
Young lady,

30:39.684 --> 30:42.585
anything to report
with your privates?

30:42.621 --> 30:45.647
Nah.

30:51.596 --> 30:53.962
All right.

30:55.600 --> 30:58.535
Meeting outside
when you're done, Doc.

30:58.570 --> 31:01.767
All right.

31:14.686 --> 31:16.654
Thanks, Doc.

31:16.688 --> 31:20.215
In a case like yours
I wouldn't know what else to prescribe.

31:23.995 --> 31:26.589
All right.

32:01.900 --> 32:04.630
Whose idea was them pears
and fucking peaches?

32:04.669 --> 32:07.194
I figured since we had 'em
for the plague meeting...

32:07.239 --> 32:09.764
Shows good thinking
and initiative.

32:09.808 --> 32:12.709
Ladle 'em out at various intervals
on the fucking table, Johnny.

32:12.744 --> 32:16.077
Yes, sir.

32:16.114 --> 32:19.550
I'm declaring myself
conductor of this meeting

32:19.584 --> 32:22.610
as I have the bribe sheet.

32:24.756 --> 32:27.782
If I'm excluded,
say so, Al.

32:27.826 --> 32:30.226
Don't leave me to die
the death of thousand cuts.

32:30.262 --> 32:31.593
Sit down, Tom.

32:31.630 --> 32:33.495
Don't subject me
to death by water torture.

32:33.531 --> 32:35.590
Take a seat, Tom,
and toss whatever book

32:35.634 --> 32:38.364
you've been reading on
the fucking yellow peril, huh?

32:43.775 --> 32:46.175
I just opened
across the way.

32:46.211 --> 32:48.475
Was I supposed to attend?

32:48.513 --> 32:50.413
Well before I can
answer that question,

32:50.448 --> 32:52.109
I better know
who the fuck you are.

32:52.150 --> 32:53.981
Charlie Utter.

32:54.019 --> 32:57.682
Of "Utter's Freight
and Postal Delivery Service. "

32:57.722 --> 33:00.623
Nice sign blocking my fucking view.
Take a seat.

33:00.659 --> 33:03.719
Had a lovely advert
in today's "Pioneer. "

33:05.430 --> 33:08.922
So, US government's
negotiating peace

33:08.967 --> 33:11.333
with Spotted Elk,
Red Cloud

33:11.369 --> 33:13.963
and other leaders of the heathens.
Thank you, Johnny.

33:14.005 --> 33:16.974
The heathens will get money
to give up the hills,

33:17.008 --> 33:19.977
and the hills'll be annexed
to the territory.

33:20.011 --> 33:23.139
First notice of our cost

33:23.181 --> 33:25.376
to avoid getting
fucked in the ass

33:25.417 --> 33:27.749
by those legislative
cocksuckers

33:27.786 --> 33:30.846
was just handed to me
by Yankton's toll collector,

33:30.889 --> 33:35.519
who suggests also our best case
in keeping title to the claims,

33:35.560 --> 33:38.324
property and businesses
is to start up now

33:38.363 --> 33:41.662
a kind of an informal
governing organization

33:41.700 --> 33:44.032
that'll be recognized
by the territorial cocksuckers

33:44.069 --> 33:47.732
and given legal status
when the territory is annexed.

33:47.772 --> 33:50.639
Since we'll all
have proved ourselves

33:50.675 --> 33:52.643
civilized sorts

33:52.677 --> 33:56.841
that don't only wear
our pants to cover our tails,

33:56.881 --> 33:59.406
hence the fucking
meeting.

33:59.451 --> 34:01.419
Do the bribes come
out of our pockets?

34:01.453 --> 34:02.784
Hmm?

34:02.821 --> 34:05.346
The hell you must have gone
through talking to that leech.

34:05.390 --> 34:07.756
Hereafter, you let me
take my fair share

34:07.792 --> 34:10.920
- of the weight in those conversations.
- Yeah, thanks, Cy.

34:10.962 --> 34:14.556
Well, couldn't our informal
organization levy taxes

34:14.599 --> 34:17.090
on the settlement
to pay the bribes?

34:17.135 --> 34:18.795
Say to license
businesses?

34:18.837 --> 34:20.600
Wouldn't that spread
the burden?

34:20.638 --> 34:22.629
Will women who pay
the license fees

34:22.674 --> 34:26.041
have the same right
to operate brothels as men?

34:30.915 --> 34:33.713
What's that got to do
with the price of fish?

34:33.752 --> 34:36.414
Our proper order
of fucking business

34:36.454 --> 34:39.911
is to make titles
and departments

34:39.958 --> 34:41.983
before the territorial
cocksuckers

34:42.025 --> 34:43.891
send in their cousins
to rob and steal from us.

34:43.928 --> 34:46.293
Well who fills
the various positions?

34:46.331 --> 34:48.925
Pick the names from a fucking hat
as far as I'm concerned.

34:48.967 --> 34:50.456
I'd like to be mayor.

34:50.502 --> 34:53.062
Objections?

34:57.842 --> 34:59.469
Mayor.

35:02.647 --> 35:06.048
Wouldn't a good use
for an informal organization

35:06.084 --> 35:07.711
with temporary appointees

35:07.752 --> 35:09.720
be providing a few
services to the camp?

35:09.754 --> 35:11.654
Mayor?

35:11.689 --> 35:13.418
Well, provide
a few services

35:13.458 --> 35:16.621
and use the lion's share
of revenues to pay the bribes.

35:19.164 --> 35:21.655
More than providing
services to 'em,

35:21.699 --> 35:25.066
taking people's money is what makes
organizations real,

35:25.103 --> 35:27.230
be they formal,
informal or temporary.

35:27.272 --> 35:29.467
There's a piano outside.

35:31.009 --> 35:32.135
Piano?

35:32.177 --> 35:34.668
When Tolliver opened
up across the way,

35:34.712 --> 35:38.512
you said we needed a fancier piano.
You ordered one.

35:38.550 --> 35:41.917
You want me to abandon the fucking
meeting to bring in a new piano?

35:41.953 --> 35:44.751
Well, I'm just telling you
it come in from Montgomery Ward.

35:44.789 --> 35:46.757
Yeah.

35:46.791 --> 35:50.727
"Any big arrival, notify me
immediately. " You said that.

35:50.762 --> 35:53.663
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Well, um-

35:53.698 --> 35:56.098
Floor's open
for levy suggestions

35:56.134 --> 35:58.261
and nominations
for department heads.

35:58.303 --> 36:01.136
Self-nominations
are permitted.

36:02.874 --> 36:04.808
Sorry.
We lack a gaveI.

36:04.843 --> 36:06.333
Doc?

36:06.377 --> 36:09.039
Who's gonna
be comptroller?

36:09.080 --> 36:11.014
Well, um, elections?

36:11.049 --> 36:12.744
Will we have
some elections

36:12.784 --> 36:15.218
somewhere down the road?
This is temporary, right?

36:15.253 --> 36:16.982
- Yeah, ad hoc.
- Ad hoc.

36:17.021 --> 36:19.956
Ad fucking hoc.
Free fucking gratis.

36:19.991 --> 36:22.118
Can we just get on
with the fucking meeting?

36:33.938 --> 36:36.463
Timid, ha.
Hardly, sir.

36:36.508 --> 36:40.444
My own strong personal impulse
was to offer my name for office,

36:40.478 --> 36:42.844
but a fourth estate,

36:42.881 --> 36:45.645
independent
in name and fact

36:45.683 --> 36:47.514
from the operations
of government

36:47.552 --> 36:51.579
is of the essence
of a free society.

37:02.767 --> 37:05.133
I've got to find
early occasion

37:05.169 --> 37:07.569
to put the mayor
off his pedestal.

37:07.605 --> 37:10.039
Don't do it
with no mud.

37:11.476 --> 37:14.912
Did you wait a day before you ordered
that fucking thing?

37:14.946 --> 37:18.643
Boss, you specifically
countermanded my waiting

37:18.683 --> 37:21.243
and asking again when you gave me
the order to get it.

37:21.286 --> 37:24.847
What fucking revenue is being generated
by those hoople-heads

37:24.889 --> 37:26.754
gathering around
that cocksucker

37:26.791 --> 37:29.351
and yodeling about
their fucking points of origin?

37:29.394 --> 37:31.624
The shine'll wear off.

37:31.663 --> 37:33.756
My fucking head.

37:33.798 --> 37:35.390
All that organizing
businesses?

37:35.433 --> 37:39.062
Aw, 25 cups of coffee and too much
circulating in the fresh air.

37:39.103 --> 37:41.765
You chaired piss out of that meeting
this afternoon.

37:41.806 --> 37:45.139
That still don't get you off the hook
about that piano.

37:49.480 --> 37:52.745
Before I'd told a story on myself
like the doc did,

37:52.784 --> 37:55.275
I'd have just said,
"Thank you for the nomination,

37:55.320 --> 37:58.118
but I decline being
health supervisor. "

37:58.156 --> 38:00.716
They buy bodies
to do their research.

38:00.758 --> 38:03.693
Doctors, they cut 'em open
and study 'em.

38:03.728 --> 38:07.459
All the less reason for saying
you've been arrested for grave robbing.

38:07.498 --> 38:09.523
Seven times.

38:10.768 --> 38:13.362
Anyways,

38:13.404 --> 38:15.531
good for you
volunteering for the post.

38:17.275 --> 38:19.766
If I had known then
they wasn't gonna have a sheriff,

38:19.811 --> 38:22.837
- I'd have never raised my hand.
- I don't follow.

38:22.880 --> 38:27.010
I only raised my hand
'cause I didn't want to be sheriff.

38:27.051 --> 38:29.246
It's all temporary,
anyhow.

38:29.287 --> 38:30.413
That's right.

38:30.455 --> 38:32.650
And ad hoc.

38:37.462 --> 38:40.556
Did you happen
to notice at The Gem

38:40.598 --> 38:43.499
that one girI we rode back with
from Mr. Garret's funeral?

38:43.534 --> 38:45.695
Trixie, isn't that what
she said her name was?

38:45.737 --> 38:48.672
- Who'd been helping with the child.
- Yeah, I noticed her.

38:48.706 --> 38:52.870
Much as she'd taken
to helping with that little one.

38:52.910 --> 38:56.141
Big pull to that,
going back to what you know.

38:58.850 --> 39:01.546
You think she's pretty?

39:01.586 --> 39:03.918
Very.

39:08.126 --> 39:10.617
- Take some air.
- Yes, sir.

39:12.563 --> 39:14.622
- Evenin'.
- Evening.

39:14.666 --> 39:15.758
Some meeting, huh?

39:15.800 --> 39:18.667
Congratulations
on your new post.

39:18.703 --> 39:19.795
Oh.

39:19.837 --> 39:21.702
And for your
freight business.

39:21.739 --> 39:24.936
- Thank you.
- Okay.

39:24.976 --> 39:27.171
Evening, Charlie.

39:27.211 --> 39:29.577
Evening.

39:34.619 --> 39:36.587
How much time
you think that

39:36.621 --> 39:40.387
Fire marshal obligation's
gonna take?

39:41.726 --> 39:45.389
More or less as much as your health
commissioner, huh?

39:47.131 --> 39:49.599
How about that doc?

39:49.634 --> 39:51.431
Grave robber.

39:55.106 --> 39:58.371
Anybody else felled
from them canned peaches?

39:58.409 --> 40:00.604
Not to my knowledge.
Why, you feeling poorly?

40:00.645 --> 40:04.240
Well, um, it's-
it's easing up some.

40:20.298 --> 40:23.028
- Evening.
- Evening.

40:23.067 --> 40:25.592
I've wondered how
things were with you...

40:25.636 --> 40:28.662
and Mrs. Garret
and the child.

40:30.875 --> 40:33.207
I expect they're well.

40:33.244 --> 40:35.678
I know she struck
lucky at her claim.

40:35.713 --> 40:37.044
And how are you, Trixie?

40:37.081 --> 40:39.208
As you see.

40:39.250 --> 40:42.742
Earning the greasy eye
from my boss for idle chatter.

40:42.787 --> 40:44.482
Can I buy
you a drink?

40:44.522 --> 40:46.752
I'd rather
you didn't.

40:49.494 --> 40:51.223
This isn't
the place for you.

40:51.262 --> 40:52.957
So you say.

40:52.997 --> 40:55.727
If you insist on
my embarrassing myself,

40:55.767 --> 40:57.928
have it not where
I'd want you to see me.

40:57.969 --> 40:59.960
Come see me then.

41:00.004 --> 41:02.302
He don't permit
our making calls out.

41:02.340 --> 41:05.104
Come to our store.
Come buy a broom.

41:06.744 --> 41:09.269
I don't want what
I can't have, Mr. Star.

41:09.313 --> 41:11.804
All right.

41:13.050 --> 41:15.245
If I did come,

41:15.286 --> 41:17.550
I'd buy an axe,
a hammer and a saw.

41:17.588 --> 41:20.580
All fully stocked.

41:20.625 --> 41:24.425
And we never ask the purpose
of a customer's purchase.

41:38.843 --> 41:41.744
Our mayor.

41:46.417 --> 41:48.942
Oh, Mayor!

42:09.273 --> 42:11.264
Doctor.

42:11.309 --> 42:13.300
I'm gonna have
a look at you.

42:15.413 --> 42:17.472
All right.

42:20.017 --> 42:22.178
Don't turn your head
away, Reverend.

42:22.220 --> 42:25.678
Being sick ain't nothing
to be ashamed of.

42:25.723 --> 42:28.214
Look at my finger.

42:33.698 --> 42:37.600
I apologize
for the smell.

42:37.635 --> 42:39.500
What is it
that you smell?

42:39.537 --> 42:42.438
As if I've died.

42:42.473 --> 42:46.102
You emit no such odor.

42:46.143 --> 42:49.078
I smell my flesh rotting.

42:49.113 --> 42:51.081
It isn't rotting, Reverend.

42:51.115 --> 42:53.845
Your flesh does not smell.

42:53.885 --> 42:56.353
You've not died.

42:56.387 --> 43:00.050
You're having organic
changes in your mind

43:00.091 --> 43:03.026
that's making you
believe these things.

43:03.060 --> 43:06.291
Do you understand me?

43:08.299 --> 43:10.824
Formerly, Doctor,

43:10.868 --> 43:14.395
when the word took me
as I read scripture,

43:14.438 --> 43:17.305
people felt God's
presence through me

43:17.341 --> 43:22.040
and that was a great gift
that I could give to them.

43:22.079 --> 43:26.413
Now the word does not
take me when I read.

43:26.450 --> 43:30.045
Nor do I feeI
Christ's love.

43:30.087 --> 43:33.250
Nor do those who listen
hear it through me.

43:33.291 --> 43:35.782
All right.

43:35.826 --> 43:39.057
This is God's purpose.

43:39.096 --> 43:42.588
The not knowing
the purpose is...

43:44.201 --> 43:46.829
my portion
of suffering.

43:46.871 --> 43:50.602
And is there any pain

43:50.641 --> 43:53.667
competing with
the not knowing?

43:55.046 --> 43:57.844
I'm not in pain.

43:57.882 --> 44:01.374
There are new smells
I smell.

44:01.419 --> 44:04.582
And there parts of my body
I can't feeI,

44:04.622 --> 44:06.249
and His-

44:06.290 --> 44:08.155
and His love.

44:08.192 --> 44:12.891
And you want
to continue like this?

44:16.901 --> 44:21.099
As long as He wills,
this must be my part.

44:21.138 --> 44:25.131
To be afraid, as well.

44:25.176 --> 44:28.168
Well if this is His
will, Reverend,

44:28.212 --> 44:32.205
He is a son of a bitch.

44:37.588 --> 44:40.284
Good night.

44:47.631 --> 44:49.895
Good night, Doctor.

45:03.514 --> 45:05.539
Hey, Eddie.

45:05.583 --> 45:08.450
Hey, kid.
How'd it go?

45:08.486 --> 45:12.582
All right.
And I got me a four-bit room.

45:12.623 --> 45:15.717
Play your cards right,
I'll tell you where.

45:26.971 --> 45:29.838
Hi, Cy.

45:29.874 --> 45:32.672
I was afraid I'd lost
you to the heathens.

45:32.710 --> 45:34.109
How was that meeting?

45:34.145 --> 45:37.342
All right.
We were organizing for annexation

45:37.381 --> 45:40.612
until Eddie cracked
his fucking mouth.

45:40.651 --> 45:42.881
What'd it turn to then?

45:51.562 --> 45:55.362
A joint like ours, Joanie,
what are we selling?

45:55.399 --> 45:57.663
Walk through this door,

45:57.701 --> 45:59.430
it's a new start.

45:59.470 --> 46:01.631
Come on in,
try your luck here.

46:01.672 --> 46:03.264
Of course, we know

46:03.307 --> 46:07.141
the percentages being the percentages,
you play long enough,

46:07.178 --> 46:10.204
your luck ain't gonna get
no better here than anywheres else.

46:10.247 --> 46:14.115
Maybe it's 'cause
we're in a brand new camp.

46:14.151 --> 46:16.085
Since we arrived,

46:16.120 --> 46:18.588
certain people
that are near and dear to me

46:18.622 --> 46:20.886
seem to have bought
into our own fucking line

46:20.925 --> 46:23.359
and now they're trying
to get me to go along.

46:23.394 --> 46:25.760
But I can't.

46:25.796 --> 46:29.892
See, Joanie,
'cause I'm a big boy.

46:29.934 --> 46:32.994
Now I'm ready for...

46:33.037 --> 46:35.528
Eddie and me
to have a little chat.

46:35.573 --> 46:38.508
I did look around
for places, Cy.

46:38.542 --> 46:40.874
Good, I wanted you to.

46:40.911 --> 46:44.369
I want to go ahead
and do what we talked about.

46:44.415 --> 46:46.610
Good, honey.

46:46.650 --> 46:49.710
With your eyes
wide open.

47:05.703 --> 47:07.432
Eddie Sawyer.

47:07.471 --> 47:09.166
Can we keep
this short?

47:09.206 --> 47:11.606
Sure, Eddie.

47:11.642 --> 47:15.510
If he finds you a 12-year-old farmboy
to have some fun with,

47:15.546 --> 47:17.605
is that short enough
for you?

47:17.648 --> 47:20.481
I never did that
and you know it.

47:20.518 --> 47:22.452
All this crap about
what is and isn't natural,

47:22.486 --> 47:25.046
whatever does it for a fella
is what does it, ain't that right?

47:25.089 --> 47:26.716
I never did that.

47:26.757 --> 47:30.625
But did you ever want to unbutton
some farmboy's Dentons

47:30.661 --> 47:33.789
and get yourself some relaxation?
That's what I'm asking.

47:33.831 --> 47:37.892
Take that boy you spoke up
for up in Joanie's room the other day.

47:39.503 --> 47:41.869
I spoke up for not
torturing that boy.

47:41.906 --> 47:44.670
Well, what you spoke for and what
you would have wanted to do

47:44.708 --> 47:47.734
if it was just you
and that corn-fed in that room alone

47:47.778 --> 47:50.645
is what I'm inquiring
about the difference between.

47:50.681 --> 47:54.173
- A dry hole, Cy.
- Aw, you could work that out.

47:54.218 --> 47:56.778
You just use some
spit on that or lard.

48:00.191 --> 48:03.160
17 fucking years
and I never saw a look on your face

48:03.194 --> 48:05.253
like I saw up there
in that room the other day.

48:05.296 --> 48:07.491
Including when I had
to smack some girI around.

48:07.531 --> 48:09.328
I was never in a room
with you before

48:09.366 --> 48:11.391
where you was
gonna kill somebody.

48:11.435 --> 48:15.269
I do not make judgments.
I gave that up a long time ago.

48:15.306 --> 48:17.433
All I want is for us
to get along better, Eddie.

48:17.474 --> 48:19.601
So every time you open
your mouth in public,

48:19.643 --> 48:22.043
I don't have to worry
about what the fuck's gonna come out!

48:22.079 --> 48:24.070
So let me get you
some fucking kid

48:24.114 --> 48:26.674
to fuck in the ass or mouth or suck
his prick or let him fuck you!

48:26.717 --> 48:29.117
Fuck you, Cy.
Fuck you.

48:29.153 --> 48:31.781
Now, now.
That's where I draw the line.

48:31.822 --> 48:34.382
Friend or no friend, and us wanting
to get along better or not,

48:34.425 --> 48:37.451
I want you to go up
into Joanie's room, which I-

48:37.494 --> 48:40.258
I gather she don't
want to go into no more.

48:40.297 --> 48:42.925
I want you to go up there and think
this thing through.

48:42.967 --> 48:45.265
Imagine yourself
up there with that boy

48:45.302 --> 48:48.897
like the other day,
only this time it's just him and you.

48:48.939 --> 48:52.431
And I want you to figure out
what it is that you want.

48:52.476 --> 48:54.671
'Cause next time
we see each other,

48:54.712 --> 48:57.579
I want you clearheaded,
and understanding yourself.

48:57.615 --> 48:59.742
The old Eddie that knows the percentages
and how to play 'em,

48:59.783 --> 49:02.911
and whatever a man does away
from the table is his own business.

49:02.953 --> 49:06.081
I want you cheerfuI
and ready to help me with my work

49:06.123 --> 49:07.784
or I don't want you
coming the fuck out!

49:07.825 --> 49:10.157
Hmm?
You finish your shift

49:10.194 --> 49:11.752
and you go up there
to Joanie's room

49:11.795 --> 49:13.490
and you think
things through.

49:13.530 --> 49:17.091
All right,
Eddie Sawyer?!

49:17.134 --> 49:20.570
Do we understand
each other?

49:20.604 --> 49:22.902
Why didn't you volunteer for something
at that meeting?

49:22.940 --> 49:24.669
Why didn't you
put your hand up?

49:24.708 --> 49:27.905
Might've kept you
from being such an evil cocksucker.

49:51.201 --> 49:53.863
Say hello to the new
fire marshal.

49:57.474 --> 50:00.341
I'm getting out.

50:00.377 --> 50:03.437
Goodbye
and good luck.

50:03.480 --> 50:05.971
Wait on it until
you ain't exhausted, Jane.

50:06.016 --> 50:07.711
Maybe you'll
change your mind.

50:07.751 --> 50:11.517
Direction of this
entire camp

50:11.555 --> 50:13.352
makes me sick,

50:13.390 --> 50:16.985
and it bores
the living shit out of me.

50:17.027 --> 50:19.552
Well working hours
like you've been working

50:19.596 --> 50:21.826
would get anyone
out of sorts.

50:21.865 --> 50:25.232
And you helped
a lot of people.

50:25.269 --> 50:28.568
Sent a dozen men
out with their plague sores healed

50:28.605 --> 50:31.165
to go back to getting
'em on their Johnsons.

50:31.208 --> 50:35.474
I will not be a drunk
where he's buried.

50:37.848 --> 50:42.717
And I cannot
stay fucking sober.

50:42.753 --> 50:45.688
So you...

50:45.723 --> 50:49.625
and every human
being on earth-

50:49.660 --> 50:51.685
past, present
and future

50:51.729 --> 50:53.822
can drink
mare's piss.

50:53.864 --> 50:55.764
Believe I'll just have
well water.

50:55.799 --> 50:58.199
- Shut up, Charlie.
- All right.

51:16.420 --> 51:19.514
If the subject comes up,

51:19.556 --> 51:23.014
explain to Bill.

51:24.895 --> 51:27.386
All right, Jane.

51:28.532 --> 51:31.467
All right.

51:34.605 --> 51:37.972
Tell them over at livery
I- I'm good for the mount.

51:38.008 --> 51:42.172
Do not fucking
worry about me.

51:42.212 --> 51:45.670
And inform Hostetler
at the fucking livery

51:45.716 --> 51:48.810
you saved his
fucking life.

51:48.852 --> 51:50.820
All right.

51:50.854 --> 51:54.119
And do not worry about
getting paid back.

51:54.158 --> 51:56.524
Check the mail,
Charlie,

51:56.560 --> 51:59.586
and you will find
soon proper payment.

51:59.630 --> 52:01.723
All right, Jane.

52:01.765 --> 52:05.257
Check with Utter Mail
and Charlie Freight!

52:05.302 --> 52:08.032
All right.

52:16.079 --> 52:20.345
Since last our eyes
were upon each other, lo,

52:20.384 --> 52:24.616
I hope you've earned
me $5.

52:31.428 --> 52:33.453
No.

52:41.338 --> 52:44.535
I- I gave the lady
your note, sir.

52:44.575 --> 52:47.738
She says to come ahead, but to knock
low as the little one's asleep.

52:47.778 --> 52:49.837
Thank you.

52:49.880 --> 52:53.646
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

53:06.563 --> 53:08.190
Evening.

53:08.232 --> 53:11.099
Good evening, Mr. Bullock.
Sophia's asleep.

53:11.134 --> 53:13.659
So I was told.
Sorry for calling so late.

53:23.747 --> 53:27.683
I'm to see Ellsworth in the morning
and wondered what I should say.

53:27.718 --> 53:30.448
Ellsworth seemed
very competent and trustworthy.

53:30.487 --> 53:32.887
He suggested
that until the extent

53:32.923 --> 53:35.221
of the quartz deposits
could be proved,

53:35.259 --> 53:37.955
he could prospect the creek
on my claim each week

53:37.995 --> 53:39.292
to keep my title active.

53:39.329 --> 53:41.593
How'd that plan
sound to you?

53:41.632 --> 53:43.497
I feeI it's exactly
the way to proceed.

53:43.534 --> 53:46.162
All right then.

53:47.804 --> 53:50.034
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

54:08.458 --> 54:10.358
Would it improve
your opinion of me

54:10.394 --> 54:13.090
if I told you I was Commissioner
of the Board of Health?

54:13.130 --> 54:17.260
How wonderfuI.
I suppose.

54:17.301 --> 54:19.462
It's to put the camp's
best foot forward

54:19.503 --> 54:21.471
as far as being taken
into the territory.

54:21.505 --> 54:23.496
A number of men
took positions.

54:23.540 --> 54:25.701
- I see.
- Farnum's mayor.

54:25.742 --> 54:28.472
How horrifying.

54:31.114 --> 54:34.345
I wrote
to my wife today.

54:34.384 --> 54:36.375
Did you?

54:36.420 --> 54:39.082
About her and my boy
coming to the camp.

54:39.122 --> 54:41.090
You have a son as well?

54:41.124 --> 54:43.592
They're in Michigan
with her people.

54:47.264 --> 54:48.595
My thinking was

54:48.632 --> 54:51.100
with the treaty coming,
annexation,

54:51.134 --> 54:53.534
the camp would
be settling down, a safer place.

54:53.570 --> 54:56.232
Yes.

55:01.612 --> 55:05.412
- Any other sons or daughters?
- No, that's it.

55:11.421 --> 55:13.480
My brother
was in the cavalry.

55:13.523 --> 55:16.458
He was killed
two years ago.

55:16.493 --> 55:18.791
I'm sorry.

55:21.498 --> 55:23.693
Anyways.

55:28.705 --> 55:31.765
I'm glad you got along
with Ellsworth.

55:31.808 --> 55:35.505
Well, thank you for all
your help, Mr. Bullock.

55:35.545 --> 55:37.206
Sure.

55:37.247 --> 55:40.045
And congratulations
on your new post

55:40.083 --> 55:42.347
and the prospect
of your family rejoining you.

55:42.386 --> 55:45.184
Thank you.

55:45.222 --> 55:48.419
Good night,
Mrs. Garret.

55:48.458 --> 55:51.655
Good night.

55:56.199 --> 56:00.636
May I ask why you spoke
of your brother?

56:00.671 --> 56:03.435
My wife
was his widow.

56:03.473 --> 56:07.136
My boy
is their child.

56:07.177 --> 56:10.578
I see.

56:11.848 --> 56:13.839
- Good night.
- Good night.

57:35.499 --> 57:38.093
& Boy, Buddy Bone,
you can blow a mean horn there. &
