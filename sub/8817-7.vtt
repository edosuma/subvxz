09:38.000 --> 09:40.400
Wait.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.433
-But you said --
-I'm not certain.

09:43.433 --> 09:45.433
[crickets chirping in distance]

09:45.433 --> 09:47.600
Okay, then. Thanks.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.400
Uh, is everything all right?

09:52.400 --> 09:56.734
Yeah. Yeah, like I said,
it was a bit of a weekend.

09:56.734 --> 10:00.033
Why don't you come in
for a drink?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.467
-[laughs]
-It... [laughs]

10:01.467 --> 10:03.567
It's more
than understandable.

10:03.567 --> 10:05.367
Given the circumstance,
it was inevitable.

10:05.367 --> 10:07.400
The son of a bitch
deserved it.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.133
But I earned my living
by staving off the inevitable.

10:11.133 --> 10:13.600
Let the other dogs drool
when the bell rings.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.467
I wait for the actual food
to turn up.

10:15.467 --> 10:18.767
That way I get fed while
the rest howl in the wind.

10:18.767 --> 10:21.734
We don't get to choose
how and when we react.

10:21.734 --> 10:24.333
That's what
the experiment proves.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.500
You've actually read
Pavlov's study, haven't you?

10:26.500 --> 10:29.734
Yeah. I was
a psych/philosophy major.

10:29.734 --> 10:31.266
Minor in economic theory,

10:31.266 --> 10:34.066
which, at Yale, is like
another philosophy class.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.300
Broadness of thinking.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.734
That's the shit
that sets you apart, Donnie.

10:37.734 --> 10:39.467
It's this shit
that used to distract me

10:39.467 --> 10:44.367
while the other guys were
racking up cartel-sized bonuses.

10:44.367 --> 10:47.433
No more.

10:47.433 --> 10:50.767
Look, no matter
how civilized we get,

10:50.767 --> 10:52.266
at base, we are animals.

10:52.266 --> 10:53.734
Oh, yeah. I know. I know.

10:53.734 --> 10:58.333
I just wish I had...
I... [sniffs]

10:58.333 --> 11:01.467
You, Donnie,
you'd have shown restraint.

11:01.467 --> 11:02.667
For the sake of your kids.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.567
Me? My kids are gonna grow up
thinking that's the way

11:04.567 --> 11:07.433
-you're supposed to act.
-They didn't see it!

11:07.433 --> 11:09.400
They'll hear about it.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.767
They'll be embarrassed.

11:10.767 --> 11:12.600
Or worse, proud.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.667
Bullshit.

11:13.667 --> 11:16.166
They should damn well
be proud.

11:16.166 --> 11:18.700
Their father stood tall
for them.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.633
It did feel pretty good.
[chuckles]

11:23.633 --> 11:26.633
If I could be that
for my kids...

11:26.633 --> 11:28.533
You are...

11:28.533 --> 11:30.767
and you will continue to be.

11:30.767 --> 11:35.533
â™ª pensive music â™ª

11:35.533 --> 11:38.433
[indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing]

11:38.433 --> 11:39.433
[Bryan, muffled voice]
All right, okay.

11:39.433 --> 11:40.767
So let's go over
what we've got so far.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.633
The CI is close to Axelrod.

11:42.633 --> 11:46.100
He has been leveraged
and he's highly motivated

11:46.100 --> 11:47.400
to save his own ass.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.533
Get Connerty in here
this afternoon.

11:50.533 --> 11:52.233
Tell him
to bring the team working

11:52.233 --> 11:53.667
the Construction Bid Rigging
RICO cases.

11:53.667 --> 11:56.533
I need an update.

11:56.533 --> 11:58.667
[Orrin] If word of this
gets out, and it will,

11:58.667 --> 12:00.567
it's a major key problem.

12:00.567 --> 12:03.000
Your business faces
an existential threat

12:03.000 --> 12:04.567
if it's handled
the wrong way.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.000
The professional damage,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
if you are convicted of even
simple misdemeanor assault --

12:09.000 --> 12:10.600
The prick
drove our kids drunk.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.133
He's the one
who should be prosecuted.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.200
He can't really press charges
'cause Bobby popped him.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.700
He will. He has to.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.467
It'll make his civil case
that much stronger.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.233
So we gotta control
the narrative.

12:21.233 --> 12:23.066
I'm already getting texts
from gossip writers

12:23.066 --> 12:24.367
who've heard rumors.

12:24.367 --> 12:26.433
It's only a matter of time
before Layner's team p--

12:26.433 --> 12:28.667
And no doubt, he has
a team in place by now.

12:28.667 --> 12:31.033
Before they pick where they
wanna dump the story

12:31.033 --> 12:32.567
for maximum impact.

12:32.567 --> 12:34.433
So we get
our version out first.

12:34.433 --> 12:36.233
You need your friend Lilly
to speak up.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.667
Say that she saw
Layner drinking,

12:37.667 --> 12:39.700
tried to stop him from
taking the kids in the car.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.633
-She won't.
-[Lara] She will.

12:41.633 --> 12:42.700
I'll get to her today.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.100
I asked Chief Mueller
to join us

12:45.100 --> 12:48.333
so can break down how things
will go at his former command --

12:48.333 --> 12:49.567
Southampton PD.

12:49.567 --> 12:52.000
Mr. Axelrod,
I received some intel

12:52.000 --> 12:53.467
just as I was
arriving here today.

12:53.467 --> 12:55.734
The police out East may have
come into possession

12:55.734 --> 12:58.567
of a video of the incident
taking on someone's phone,

12:58.567 --> 13:01.000
which purports to show you
striking Mr. Layner.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.300
-That should cut our way.
-I'm not so sure.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.300
-How bad is it?
-Well, I haven't seen it yet,

13:05.300 --> 13:07.033
but I've been told
it's damning enough

13:07.033 --> 13:08.600
that they're planning on
arresting you

13:08.600 --> 13:10.033
as early as tomorrow.

13:10.033 --> 13:12.633
But when Mr. Bach reached out
to me, I reached out.

13:12.633 --> 13:15.166
And fortunately, even though
I left the department

13:15.166 --> 13:18.333
seven years ago, that I'm still
remembered fondly back there.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.533
That's good for all of us.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.667
It would be a big help
if you could get confirmation

13:21.667 --> 13:23.200
of Layner's drinking.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.000
With that, the air goes out of
the balloon on prosecuting you.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.300
Without it, you'll likely
be indicted and tried.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.567
I'm arranging a back door
arrival at the station house

13:32.567 --> 13:36.133
for the two of us and Mr. Bach.

13:36.133 --> 13:38.467
[Chase] Well, most people
would kill to have your career.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.000
Depending on what you want,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.333
I can get on the phone and bring
you a dozen offers by 5 p.m.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.667
Can we...
[inhales deeply]

13:44.667 --> 13:47.567
Let's slow this down.
I need to be discreet.

13:47.567 --> 13:48.567
Understood.

13:48.567 --> 13:50.233
This is just
a reconnaissance mission.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.333
I'm not committing here.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.367
Right. You're not sure
what you want,

13:53.367 --> 13:56.767
which is a new feeling
for someone like you.

13:56.767 --> 13:59.633
That won't work on me.
I know all the tricks.

13:59.633 --> 14:01.700
I'm sure you do.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.000
Plus, you're brilliant.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.467
Billie always told me
that you were the smartest

14:05.467 --> 14:08.233
of all of her friends.

14:08.233 --> 14:11.033
She said nice things
about you, too, Chase.

14:11.033 --> 14:14.433
[laughs] I'm not sure I want
the specifics behind that look.

14:14.433 --> 14:15.633
Good. That's all
you're getting.

14:15.633 --> 14:17.700
[laughs]

14:17.700 --> 14:20.066
All right, well,
then let's talk about you.

14:20.066 --> 14:22.266
What can I do for you
to help you figure this out?

14:22.266 --> 14:24.467
No hedge funds.

14:24.467 --> 14:27.400
Nothing in finance.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.700
I can't work for a competitor.
That would feel wrong.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.233
Well, that limits us.

14:31.233 --> 14:33.734
What's more important to you,
the comp or the work itself?

14:33.734 --> 14:36.433
Do I have to choose?
I have both now.

14:36.433 --> 14:39.700
-It's rare. Both is hard.
-How hard?

14:39.700 --> 14:41.266
If you want to leave
the hedgie world,

14:41.266 --> 14:42.400
nearly impossible.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.533
I don't know if I want to.

14:47.433 --> 14:49.266
It's what's best
for my family.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.567
Well, corporate HR jobs
with huge comp

14:54.567 --> 14:56.133
won't be hands-on
with clients.

14:56.133 --> 14:59.033
And the rewarding work, like
the stuff you're doing now,

14:59.033 --> 15:01.300
digging deep with folks
who need to change quickly,

15:01.300 --> 15:04.100
that really only happens
in the nonprofit sector.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.533
You'll be living on love
instead of money.

15:06.533 --> 15:08.700
So you've got nothing
for me.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.767
Nothing without
a compromise.

15:10.767 --> 15:13.166
I wanna shoot straight
with you from the beginning,

15:13.166 --> 15:14.600
which is not usually
how I work.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.467
Did you just
say that out loud?

15:16.467 --> 15:17.633
[chuckles]

15:17.633 --> 15:19.500
For some reason,
I don't wanna bullshit you

15:19.500 --> 15:21.066
into giving me a retainer.

15:22.667 --> 15:25.033
I wonder why that is.

15:26.734 --> 15:28.700
You all have 'em.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.600
So-called friends
at other funds

15:30.600 --> 15:32.633
who tell you
that we're dinosaurs,

15:32.633 --> 15:35.033
oblivious to our own extinction.

15:35.033 --> 15:37.233
Are you gonna tell us they're
not our real  friends, Mom?

15:37.233 --> 15:38.567
[laughter]
-I'm gonna tell you

15:38.567 --> 15:40.700
that they're assholes...
and wrong.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.767
[Donnie] While it's true
we have less outside money,

15:43.767 --> 15:45.367
the trade-off is freedom.

15:45.367 --> 15:47.633
-[woman and man] Yes.
-This is our time.

15:47.633 --> 15:50.700
Those of you in this room
will be telling the story

15:50.700 --> 15:53.133
years from now about
how we got up off the canvas

15:53.133 --> 15:54.700
and knocked the rest of 'em out.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.100
-[women] Yeah!
[applause]

15:56.100 --> 15:57.333
[Donnie] In fact,
we won't even have to tell them,

15:57.333 --> 15:59.533
because they will all be
in here begging for jobs.

15:59.533 --> 16:01.467
[all] Yeah!

16:01.467 --> 16:03.100
[Mafee] To that end, you know...

16:03.100 --> 16:04.734
-[man] You know it.
-...knocking folks out,

16:04.734 --> 16:06.600
a couple of us
got you something, Axe.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.633
I mean, you earned it.

16:08.633 --> 16:11.233
-We just picked it up.
-[laughs]

16:11.233 --> 16:12.600
[applause]
-[man] Whoo!

16:12.600 --> 16:14.166
-[woman] All right.
-[Mafee] There it is.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.333
[cheers and applause]

16:16.333 --> 16:18.367
We heard you knocked
that fucker on his ass.

[purse thuds]

16:55.233 --> 16:56.433
[lock turns]

16:56.433 --> 16:57.767
Well, you're certainly
winning friends

16:57.767 --> 16:59.333
and influencing people
these days.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.633
Oh, what do you
want me to say?

17:00.633 --> 17:02.100
I shouldn't have
thrown that punch.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.767
You've done a lot of rash things
you shouldn't have done lately.

17:04.767 --> 17:06.667
Oh. Oh, you're talking about

17:06.667 --> 17:08.667
that little sit-down
with your husband?

17:08.667 --> 17:11.000
-I am.
[touchscreen clicking]

17:11.000 --> 17:12.500
You know, there's
a psychological profile

17:12.500 --> 17:13.767
for people
who self-sabotage,

17:13.767 --> 17:17.400
and...you're starting
to fit it.

17:19.767 --> 17:21.033
[exhales]

17:21.033 --> 17:24.133
The term, when it comes to
that settlement meeting,

17:24.133 --> 17:26.700
is self-defense,
not self-sabotage.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.633
I might've been wrong
at the barbecue,

17:28.633 --> 17:32.000
but sometimes
I gotta hit back.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.100
-The way I heard it --
-Don't worry about it.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.166
You just did what
you thought was right,

17:35.166 --> 17:37.266
and I appreciate that.

17:41.367 --> 17:45.400
But just think about
who had what to lose.

17:45.400 --> 17:49.400
I know that I went into
that room ready to make a deal.

17:53.066 --> 17:56.033
[footsteps depart]

17:56.033 --> 17:57.667
[Lara] It just bugs me,
you know?

17:57.667 --> 17:59.333
That Bobby clocked the guy?

17:59.333 --> 18:02.000
No, that the kids didn't
pick up that Layner was drunk,

18:02.000 --> 18:03.300
that they didn't call me.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.600
They had a phone?

18:04.600 --> 18:06.133
Yeah. They always do.

18:06.133 --> 18:09.400
They call me to tell me that
their Instagram isn't loading.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.300
They're just not
street smart.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.533
How are they gonna be
street smart?

18:12.533 --> 18:13.567
They've never been
in the streets.

18:13.567 --> 18:16.600
Yeah. Exactly.

18:16.600 --> 18:20.066
If our situation ever changed,
how would the boys deal with it?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.066
[huffs]

18:26.000 --> 18:26.767
[woman] The last piece is,

18:26.767 --> 18:28.533
the contractor
from the New Jersey firm

18:28.533 --> 18:31.233
kept records on
three different devices.

18:31.233 --> 18:33.066
They're all
in our possession.

18:33.066 --> 18:34.233
Trial is in six weeks.

18:34.233 --> 18:36.734
Great work. Thank you, guys.

18:36.734 --> 18:38.467
Take it easy this weekend,
T., yeah?

18:38.467 --> 18:40.200
-Yeah, I'll try.
-Take your kid

18:40.200 --> 18:42.100
-to the batting cages.
-Mm.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.734
Uh, Bryan, hang in for a second.

18:44.734 --> 18:47.100
Let's go over
some of the details.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.533
-[sniffs]
-Right.

18:50.533 --> 18:52.600
[clears throat]

18:52.600 --> 18:53.633
[doors close]

18:53.633 --> 18:57.200
You have an informant
in Axe Capital.

18:57.200 --> 19:00.033
Boss, we should stick
to the rules of recusal,

19:00.033 --> 19:02.100
the old Chinese Wall,
shouldn't we?

19:08.467 --> 19:09.734
Okay.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.467
[clears throat]

19:16.567 --> 19:19.133
So we've been profiling
all the players

19:19.133 --> 19:21.600
and scanning the activity
at Axe Cap,

19:21.600 --> 19:24.200
and we see this Donnie Caan.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.600
[Bryan] Usually
a mid-level guy, but suddenly,

19:26.600 --> 19:30.133
he loads up on Rubinex,
a biochem company.

19:30.133 --> 19:34.033
Loads  way  up. I mean,
way above his usual range.

19:34.033 --> 19:36.600
-[Chuck] Mm-hmm.
-The company, miraculously,

19:36.600 --> 19:39.033
gets an FDA seal of approval
on a product.

19:39.033 --> 19:40.667
-Even more miraculously...
-[laughs]

19:40.667 --> 19:42.100
Caan is already there,

19:42.100 --> 19:44.433
and he sells at
a monster profit.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.166
[cheering]

19:46.166 --> 19:47.300
So I put the agents on,

19:47.300 --> 19:49.300
and then they start
bloodhounding him.

19:49.300 --> 19:52.100
He couldn't provide
the research on the trade.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.500
He had no sign-offs
from compliance.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.700
He didn't have dick.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.500
And our tech guys were able
to pull meta-data

19:57.500 --> 20:00.233
that established he'd been
in contact with insiders.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.700
[man speaks indistinctly]

20:01.700 --> 20:03.433
We had him boxed up.

20:03.433 --> 20:05.200
He broke like
a Mexican condom.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.767
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

20:06.767 --> 20:08.567
He agreed to cooperate
right away.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.734
[Lilly] I wanna help you,
Lara.

20:10.734 --> 20:12.133
And Bobby.

20:12.133 --> 20:14.166
Oh. Great.

20:14.166 --> 20:16.767
And I would if I were sure,
you know?

20:16.767 --> 20:19.233
Sure? You're the one
who told me.

20:19.233 --> 20:20.533
I did.

20:20.533 --> 20:24.433
And I feel bad that I started
a whole thing, but...

20:24.433 --> 20:27.066
Keith told me that we can't
have any press right now,

20:27.066 --> 20:31.533
that it would fuck his business
badly to be near any of this.

20:31.533 --> 20:34.166
His business?

20:36.367 --> 20:38.066
He's my husband.

20:38.066 --> 20:39.400
Not much else I can say.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.467
I have to go.

20:41.467 --> 20:43.133
Maid's leaving at 3:00 today.

20:43.133 --> 20:45.633
Some bullshit about taking
her kids to the doctor.

20:45.633 --> 20:47.333
Mm.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.500
Bye.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.734
[heels clacking]

20:49.734 --> 20:53.367
â™ª tense music â™ª

20:57.266 --> 20:59.300
[Bruce] I got your precious,
fucking babies home.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.533
[Bobby] What? I will kill you,
your motherfucker.

21:01.533 --> 21:03.400
-Uhh!
-[woman] Oh!

21:03.400 --> 21:05.300
-[guests murmuring]
-Get up!

21:07.367 --> 21:10.133
[Bruce] That's gonna
fucking cost you.

21:10.133 --> 21:11.667
Worth it.

21:11.667 --> 21:14.433
[woman]
Someone call the police.

21:14.433 --> 21:16.367
The beginning --
is there any more?

21:16.367 --> 21:18.100
That's all.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.600
-[Wags] Mm. This is not good.
-[sighs deeply]

21:23.600 --> 21:26.767
We need to get more of the
original video, if it exists.

21:26.767 --> 21:31.200
It'll tell a totally different
story about what happened.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.700
-Who had this?
-It's from Mike Dimonda.

21:33.700 --> 21:36.166
Says it landed in
his in-box this morning.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.600
An exclusive.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.133
-Well, he's doing us a solid.
-Not so solid.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.767
He knows that charges
are being filed.

21:41.767 --> 21:43.066
He's requesting comment,

21:43.066 --> 21:46.600
wants to run something
right away.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.734
Who filmed that?

21:47.734 --> 21:51.266
[sighs] Dimonda won't say.

21:51.266 --> 21:54.367
â™ª tense music â™ª

21:58.633 --> 22:00.400
Okay.

22:02.700 --> 22:05.700
[Bobby] There were 11 people
in the backyard.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.500
There were two on
the other side of the pool.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.266
They didn't have a good view.

22:09.266 --> 22:11.333
The video was from
my left side.

22:11.333 --> 22:15.600
There were only...
six people on my left.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.767
One of them was Layner's wife.

22:17.767 --> 22:20.400
She was holding a platter.
She didn't have an iPhone.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.300
Layner's kids were there...

22:22.300 --> 22:25.166
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

22:25.166 --> 22:27.033
...and his son
from his first marriage.

22:27.033 --> 22:28.367
It wasn't him either.

22:28.367 --> 22:30.600
He was still wet
and had his bathing suit on.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.734
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

22:32.734 --> 22:35.300
[Bobby snaps fingers]

22:35.300 --> 22:37.200
That kid's girlfriend.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.300
There was another girl

22:40.300 --> 22:43.400
standing next to her,
about the same age -- 17.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.567
Neither of them
had been in the pool.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.367
Each of them had a phone out.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.333
Holy shit! [laughs]

22:48.333 --> 22:50.066
I fucking love
when you do that.

22:50.066 --> 22:51.567
Your love is touching,

22:51.567 --> 22:55.233
but what I need right now
is to find that original video.

22:55.233 --> 22:57.367
Find it, pay what we need,
get it.

22:57.367 --> 23:00.066
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

23:00.066 --> 23:02.633
[door opens]

23:02.633 --> 23:05.133
[door closes]

23:05.133 --> 23:06.667
I have to go to the Hamptons.

23:06.667 --> 23:08.433
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

23:08.433 --> 23:11.000
[inhales deeply, exhales slowly]

23:15.500 --> 23:17.133
[door clicks]

23:21.200 --> 23:24.400
[sighs]

23:27.066 --> 23:29.367
[door creaks]

23:29.367 --> 23:30.734
Ah. Tommy.

23:30.734 --> 23:32.200
How you doing, Chief?

23:32.200 --> 23:34.266
I tell you, I've been better.
[chuckles]

23:34.266 --> 23:36.700
Summers out here enough to make
you long for martial law.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.266
[laughter]

23:38.266 --> 23:39.500
You remember what it's like.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.133
-Ah, sorry to hear it.
-Ah, don't be.

23:42.133 --> 23:44.600
It'd be better if, in addition
to the college kids

23:44.600 --> 23:47.433
and regular dirtbags,
I didn't have my billionaires

23:47.433 --> 23:49.100
punching out
my multimillionaires.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.500
It's bad for business.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.300
Well, that's why we're here,
to make your life easier.

23:53.300 --> 23:57.066
We wanna quash this thing.
No need for news stories.

23:57.066 --> 23:59.166
No need for undue chatter.

23:59.166 --> 24:01.433
Sure. Of course.

24:01.433 --> 24:03.700
I lift the rug,
and you guys sweep?

24:03.700 --> 24:07.333
Or were you thinking vice versa,
and I make with the broom?

24:07.333 --> 24:09.300
Come on, Tommy, we both know

24:09.300 --> 24:11.433
this is probably gonna end up
in a payment situation.

24:11.433 --> 24:13.734
Why don't we work together
and get there sooner?

24:13.734 --> 24:16.700
Uh-huh. Not so easy.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.333
I've seen the video.

24:18.333 --> 24:23.166
When it goes public, there's
gonna be a lot of pressure.

24:23.166 --> 24:26.467
So we'll take a statement of
Mr. Axelrod's version of events.

24:26.467 --> 24:28.467
If Mr. Layner refuses
to relent,

24:28.467 --> 24:31.367
if he insists
on pressing charges,

24:31.367 --> 24:34.734
if the DA doesn't like what he
hears and chooses to proceed,

24:34.734 --> 24:38.066
well, courtesy or not,
Chief,

24:38.066 --> 24:39.767
it'll be out of my hands.

24:39.767 --> 24:41.200
[front door closes]

24:41.200 --> 24:43.467
-Hey, sweetheart.
-Hey, baby.

24:43.467 --> 24:44.500
-What's the latest?
[briefcase thuds]

24:44.500 --> 24:46.600
Oh, you know.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.500
Kevin had a friend over
from school.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.333
Told Eva
she could hang, too,

24:50.333 --> 24:52.133
and then pretty much
ignored her.

24:52.133 --> 24:53.367
How'd that play out?

24:53.367 --> 24:56.033
She cried,
and then he was nicer.

24:56.033 --> 25:00.066
Oh. So a normal weekday
afternoon negotiation, huh?

25:00.066 --> 25:02.500
-Speaking of...
-Mm-hmm?

25:04.367 --> 25:06.233
Mmm.

25:06.233 --> 25:08.300
How did the, uh,

25:08.300 --> 25:12.000
breakdown of the settlement
play out?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.066
'Cause the way you described it
didn't sound --

25:14.066 --> 25:16.000
Yeah. Well...

25:16.000 --> 25:19.367
Well, I'll tell you, uh...

25:19.367 --> 25:22.033
Things were all
pre-negotiated, laid out.

25:22.033 --> 25:25.367
But, you know,
these conferences are...

25:25.367 --> 25:27.500
unpredictable.
Tensions are high.

25:27.500 --> 25:31.100
Certain realities set in.
[inhales deeply]

25:31.100 --> 25:35.133
And, uh, big game fish often
has one final thrash in him

25:35.133 --> 25:37.000
as he gets close
to the boat.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.367
[chuckles]

25:40.166 --> 25:41.467
[utensil stirring]

25:41.467 --> 25:46.033
Anyway, as I said, then...

25:46.033 --> 25:47.133
[mouth full]
he tore up the check.

25:47.133 --> 25:48.533
[bowl thuds]

25:51.500 --> 25:52.633
[bottles clink]

25:52.633 --> 25:54.133
We have the Gilberts
tomorrow night.

25:54.133 --> 25:55.166
[refrigerator door closes]

25:55.166 --> 25:58.333
They could only get a table
at 7:30, so...

25:58.333 --> 26:01.367
make sure you can
get there in time.

26:01.367 --> 26:03.400
No chance of a reschedule?

26:03.400 --> 26:04.467
-This is the reschedule...
[bottle thuds]

26:04.467 --> 26:06.133
of  a reschedule.

26:06.133 --> 26:07.767
-[sighs]
-What?

26:07.767 --> 26:09.433
I don't know.
It's just I'm --

26:09.433 --> 26:11.200
I'm just
a little bit creeped out

26:11.200 --> 26:12.533
by how close those two are.

26:12.533 --> 26:14.533
They're married.
Shouldn't they be close?

26:16.600 --> 26:20.000
[sighs heavily]
Not that  close.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
[liquid pours]

26:21.000 --> 26:22.700
Oh, thank you.

26:24.533 --> 26:27.467
Mmm. That's great, Ryan.

26:27.467 --> 26:30.266
My breakfast
kind of sucks.

26:30.266 --> 26:31.767
What did you just say?

26:31.767 --> 26:33.500
I'm sick
of cheese omelettes.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.233
The cheese is kind of sticky.

26:35.233 --> 26:37.400
No sweat, big guy.
What can I make you?

26:37.400 --> 26:38.600
Nothing.
The omelettes are great,

26:38.600 --> 26:40.266
and both of you
are finishing them.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.433
But these are lame, and we have
them, like, almost every day.

26:43.433 --> 26:46.033
And dad never makes us
finish our plates.

26:46.033 --> 26:48.266
First,
apologize to Chef Ryan.

26:48.266 --> 26:50.100
[Gordie and Dean] Sorry.

26:50.100 --> 26:51.367
And now let's go.

26:51.367 --> 26:54.600
-Where?
-Get in the car. Now.

26:56.300 --> 26:59.033
[waves crashing,
seabirds calling]

26:59.033 --> 27:00.600
[Gordie]
Why is the water brown?

27:00.600 --> 27:02.333
It just is. Now get in.

27:04.033 --> 27:05.300
[seabirds continue calling]

27:06.467 --> 27:07.700
It's cold!

27:07.700 --> 27:09.033
I wanna leave.

27:09.033 --> 27:10.300
Stop whining,
or I'll throw you in.

27:10.300 --> 27:14.100
[waves crashing]

27:14.100 --> 27:15.433
What are we doing?

27:15.433 --> 27:16.600
You're clamming.

27:16.600 --> 27:20.066
When I was a kid, me and Aunt Lu
and all your uncles,

27:20.066 --> 27:21.333
we had to come out here
with Grandma

27:21.333 --> 27:23.633
and collect 50 clams for
Sunday dinner or we didn't eat.

27:23.633 --> 27:26.266
And that taught us something
about work,

27:26.266 --> 27:28.200
about earning our own living.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.467
What do we do?

27:30.467 --> 27:33.066
You feel with your feet
on the bottom for littlenecks.

27:33.066 --> 27:34.233
Like this.

27:34.233 --> 27:35.600
You shimmy.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.233
So how many do you
want us to get?

27:44.233 --> 27:45.600
Well,
you eat what you catch,

27:45.600 --> 27:48.200
so you get as many as you can
before the tide goes out.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.066
When's that?

27:50.066 --> 27:53.100
About four hours from now.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.500
[waves continue crashing]

27:58.100 --> 27:59.467
[Raul] You know I didn't drive
all the way up here to Westport

27:59.467 --> 28:01.467
to give out "attaboys."

28:01.467 --> 28:04.567
Had to bring the kick-ass.
With love.

28:04.567 --> 28:06.300
Rumblings got to me.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.700
I hate motherfucking rumblings

28:08.700 --> 28:11.266
because truth is always
underneath 'em.

28:11.266 --> 28:13.734
You hit some guy
and knocked him out.

28:13.734 --> 28:16.467
Down. Not out.

28:16.467 --> 28:19.200
A fine distinction.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.567
Thanks, Wags.

28:20.567 --> 28:22.533
I hung in after Dollar Bill
got arrested,

28:22.533 --> 28:24.767
because if anyone knows
you can't let one miscreant

28:24.767 --> 28:28.033
tattoo a whole place,
it's an ex-cop.

28:28.033 --> 28:30.200
But if people think
you're feeling the pressure,

28:30.200 --> 28:32.633
acting out, hitting folks,
for fuck's sake,

28:32.633 --> 28:34.533
they will run for the exits.

28:34.533 --> 28:36.266
Banks'll even look at you
as a shaky investment.

28:36.266 --> 28:38.367
Credit'll start drying up.

28:38.367 --> 28:39.667
I won't let that happen.

28:39.667 --> 28:41.367
The time to not let that happen
was before you threw the punch.

28:41.367 --> 28:44.266
Last thing I want to do
is pull my money,

28:44.266 --> 28:46.400
but I will.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.367
If you take a conviction,
even for a misdemeanor,

28:49.367 --> 28:52.233
we are gone.

28:52.233 --> 28:55.000
Settle your trouble.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.767
Get a non-disclosure form
signed.

28:56.767 --> 29:00.266
I know. Thanks for
coming in person.

29:02.266 --> 29:05.000

and it's ready to run,

29:08.233 --> 29:10.300
with or without comment.

29:10.300 --> 29:13.166
Get me a meeting with him
before he posts it.

29:13.166 --> 29:15.333
[telephones ring in distance]

29:15.333 --> 29:18.633
Ari Spyros,
live and in person.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.300
Any special beverage
requests?

29:20.300 --> 29:21.367
No, not today, Chuck.

29:21.367 --> 29:22.433
I'm just looking forward
to seeing the team.

29:22.433 --> 29:24.033
Oh, you'll see, all right.

29:24.033 --> 29:27.000
I think you're gonna find this
pretty interesting.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.533
Right in there.

29:28.533 --> 29:32.133
Martina Slovis.

29:32.133 --> 29:34.367
â™ª dramatic music â™ª

29:34.367 --> 29:38.100
I warned you,
if you fucked with me...

29:38.100 --> 29:40.200
holy hell.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.033
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

29:44.033 --> 29:47.066
Did you ever wonder why we
weren't pals anymore, Spyros?

29:47.066 --> 29:50.200
I mean, we were in study groups
together at law school.

29:54.567 --> 29:57.266
I thought it was just
an inter-agency rivalry.

29:57.266 --> 29:59.467
Mm. Think back.

29:59.467 --> 30:02.333
It's before you were at SEC
and I was here.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.667
Summer of 2005,

30:03.667 --> 30:06.734
the Willigut Farley mixer
at Moran's.

30:06.734 --> 30:10.333
I saw her at the bar,
Martina Slovis.

30:10.333 --> 30:13.166
She was a summer associate
in corporate work.

30:13.166 --> 30:17.400
I pointed you out,
said that I'd come in with you,

30:17.400 --> 30:19.066
and she went white.

30:20.467 --> 30:22.333
Absolutely white.

30:22.333 --> 30:25.500
And she just said the words,

30:25.500 --> 30:29.333
"Ari Spyros raped me."

30:29.333 --> 30:32.633
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

30:32.633 --> 30:35.333
[scoffs]

30:35.333 --> 30:38.367
And you --
you believed her?

30:38.367 --> 30:40.367
We've been friends
for six years.

30:40.367 --> 30:42.133
I wasn't totally convinced,

30:42.133 --> 30:44.700
until I found you
at the table later.

30:44.700 --> 30:47.166
And I said,

30:47.166 --> 30:49.233
"Guess who I just
ran into at the bar?

30:49.233 --> 30:52.400
Martina Slovis."

30:52.400 --> 30:54.100
You remember what you said?

30:54.100 --> 30:56.133
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

30:56.133 --> 30:59.767
"I fucked that little piece.
What'd she  say?"

31:02.233 --> 31:03.633
That's when I knew.

31:03.633 --> 31:04.767
[inhales sharply]
You can't --

31:04.767 --> 31:07.066
Okay, don't. That's enough.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.066
-Sick.

-It would be he said, she said.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.367
The statutes have run.

31:14.367 --> 31:17.300
We both know what it was.

31:17.300 --> 31:21.033
You destroyed a good part
of that woman's life.

31:21.033 --> 31:23.233
And she will work with me
to destroy all of yours

31:23.233 --> 31:26.333
if you don't fall the fuck
back into line!

31:26.333 --> 31:28.066
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

31:28.066 --> 31:31.200
From here on in, I  tell  you
your position in this,

31:31.200 --> 31:33.300
if you have one at all.

31:33.300 --> 31:36.400
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

31:39.367 --> 31:40.400
[Chuck] So?

31:40.400 --> 31:41.700
Um...

31:41.700 --> 31:44.066
Well, she said she was
surprised to get the call

31:44.066 --> 31:46.066
considering she just
went back and got her degree

31:46.066 --> 31:47.166
a few years ago.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.433
Hasn't really practiced.

31:48.433 --> 31:50.700
She's living near Philly
with young kids,

31:50.700 --> 31:53.467
said she wasn't thinking
about going back to work.

31:53.467 --> 31:54.533
If you don't
mind me saying so,

31:54.533 --> 31:55.600
there's lots of lawyers
out there

31:55.600 --> 31:56.734
with much stronger
litigation experience.

31:56.734 --> 31:58.066
But I have notes
on the interview.

31:58.066 --> 31:59.767
No. Of course.
It was just an idea.

31:59.767 --> 32:02.233
[inhales sharply]
Uh, pay for her ticket back

32:02.233 --> 32:04.300
and put her on the reference
list at the Philly office.

32:04.300 --> 32:05.767
Mm-hmm.

32:05.767 --> 32:07.233
I look forward to reading
your notes. Thank you.

32:07.233 --> 32:08.667
Okay.

at the last joint, but you've
been shy about going back.

I need to be careful

And I'm not that comfortable

33:08.066 --> 33:10.233

any income at all.

33:10.233 --> 33:12.600
Yeah, but you didn't
bring me here to eat

33:12.600 --> 33:16.734
and gossip about wiseguys.

33:16.734 --> 33:20.400
You want to address
the story and the video.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.200
And you're leading
the pack with it.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.066
Very impressive reporting.

33:24.066 --> 33:26.233
Yeah. I landed it.

33:26.233 --> 33:27.467
And I'm running it.

we're talking about.

biological standpoint,

there's a reason
we smell our shit, hmm?

37:52.200 --> 37:54.300
We have to toughen up
the kids.

37:56.133 --> 37:57.533
They'll get tough
when they need to.

37:57.533 --> 37:59.266
[pillow thuds]
-Yeah? How?

37:59.266 --> 38:01.467
Everything's served up
for them on a platter.

38:01.467 --> 38:02.533
The way we grew up,

38:02.533 --> 38:04.500
we had to learn how
to take care of ourselves.

38:04.500 --> 38:08.100
Yeah, sure. We learned to
scratch and claw for ours.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.533
Not all upside, though.

38:09.533 --> 38:11.333
-No?
-No.

38:11.333 --> 38:13.367
Remember when we first
got together?

38:13.367 --> 38:15.500
I was still an animal.
I was too hard.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.400
Not the sensitive flower
you are today?

38:18.400 --> 38:22.500
Exactly. I had to work
to soften up.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.333
[glass clinks]
-You  worked me over.

38:24.333 --> 38:28.233
And being thorny
still gets me in trouble.

38:28.233 --> 38:30.767
Yeah, well, I'd be willing for
them to go in that direction.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.467
You always said that
the desperation

38:32.467 --> 38:34.600
is what gave you an edge
over the rich kids.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.200
They are  the rich kids.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.166
Where are they gonna
get their grit?

38:38.166 --> 38:41.066
All right.

38:41.066 --> 38:43.200
We'll put 'em on a fishing
trawler for the summer,

38:43.200 --> 38:44.300
stick them in
the Foreign Legion.

38:44.300 --> 38:46.166
They'll be men
when we pick 'em up.

38:46.166 --> 38:47.734
This is serious.

38:51.433 --> 38:53.367
I hear you.

38:53.367 --> 38:56.500
Whatever you come up with,
you know I'll support.

39:58.367 --> 40:01.266
I'm actually glad
you have this Axe thing now.

40:01.266 --> 40:02.400
I can devote myself

40:02.400 --> 40:04.533
to the hundred other cases
I'm building.

40:04.533 --> 40:06.266
I want you to know that.

40:06.266 --> 40:08.667
I'm glad to hear you
say that, boss.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.533
Yeah.

40:10.533 --> 40:14.767
I just wish I were sure about
this informant you have.

[inhales deeply]

40:16.233 --> 40:17.700
Uh-huh.

40:17.700 --> 40:19.533
I mean, he sounds all right,
the way you describe it,

40:19.533 --> 40:20.667
so that's good.

40:20.667 --> 40:24.700
But then, you don't have
anything concrete yet.

40:24.700 --> 40:26.433
-Early days.
-Mm-hmm.

40:26.433 --> 40:28.633
You know, one thing
I used to do to informants

40:28.633 --> 40:29.767
when I had your job,

40:29.767 --> 40:32.367
every few weeks,
I'd rough 'em up a little bit.

40:32.367 --> 40:35.066
Really made sure they knew
the spot I had 'em in.

40:35.066 --> 40:37.567
Little motivational session.

40:37.567 --> 40:39.000
Yes.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.333
I have to meet with him soon,
anyway, to give him the script

40:41.333 --> 40:43.266
to get Axe to really
incriminate himself.

40:43.266 --> 40:44.266
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

40:44.266 --> 40:46.367
You know, Axe knows
people everywhere,

40:46.367 --> 40:48.667
so make sure you use
a secure location.

40:48.667 --> 40:50.767
There's a place I've used.

40:50.767 --> 40:51.767
Very secure.

40:51.767 --> 40:55.000
No chance that Axe
is hooked in there.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.033
I don't want to overstep,
make an actual suggestion.

40:58.033 --> 41:00.033
I'm sure you don't.

You haven't come in
for weeks.

41:22.300 --> 41:26.333
It looks like Axe
has brought you close.

41:26.333 --> 41:28.467
In the past,
you've talked about feeling

41:28.467 --> 41:30.467
almost intimidated by him
in the work setting,

41:30.467 --> 41:32.767
but you've got a lot
of back and forth going now.

41:32.767 --> 41:34.400
He's a great resource.

41:34.400 --> 41:37.600
I decided I shouldn't
shy away from that anymore.

41:44.033 --> 41:48.633
You used to be one of

but you've withdrawn from me.

41:56.166 --> 41:59.500
Even now,
I sense you withholding.

41:59.500 --> 42:02.633
Maybe I'm just tired.

42:02.633 --> 42:04.500
Maybe I'm --
I'm just doing well

42:04.500 --> 42:08.233
and I don't wanna jinx it
by...talking about it.

I couldn't stop thinking
about your problem.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.333
-Uh-huh.
-Now I know you're the doc,

42:25.333 --> 42:26.533
but let me prescribe you
something.

42:26.533 --> 42:29.433
A boulevardier for her, please,
and another one for me.

42:29.433 --> 42:33.400
It's like a Negroni, but with
rye instead of gin. Try it.

42:33.400 --> 42:36.233
How the fuck did you know
I liked Negronis?

42:36.233 --> 42:37.533
Billie told me.

42:37.533 --> 42:39.033
Well, I asked her.

42:39.033 --> 42:41.166
Is that something
a headhunter needs to know

42:41.166 --> 42:42.633
about a client these days?

42:42.633 --> 42:44.767
Well, you're more interesting
than my other clients.

42:44.767 --> 42:48.266
[scoffs] Cut the shit.
I don't need to be flattered.

42:48.266 --> 42:49.333
That's
an occupational hazard,

42:49.333 --> 42:51.266
and in your case,
it's not flattery.

42:51.266 --> 42:53.533
So...I came across
something today --

42:53.533 --> 42:56.667
a job that I think
might be your Shangri-La.

42:56.667 --> 42:58.767
And they don't use
outside headhunters,

42:58.767 --> 43:02.033
and I'm not gonna charge you
directly if you get the gig.

43:02.033 --> 43:04.533
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

43:04.533 --> 43:08.233
Do you wanna talk about why
you're undervaluing yourself?

43:08.233 --> 43:11.166
No.

43:11.166 --> 43:13.700
[both chuckle]

43:13.700 --> 43:15.000
Tell me about the job.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.567
It is
a blue-chip consulting firm.

43:16.567 --> 43:18.734
They do turnarounds
from the inside out.

43:18.734 --> 43:22.066
And the clients -- we're talking
innovators, thought leaders,

43:22.066 --> 43:23.233
Fortune 500 folks --

43:23.233 --> 43:25.667
crazy geniuses that need to be
met on their own terms.

43:25.667 --> 43:27.100
You want a challenge,

43:27.100 --> 43:29.700
this job's gonna require that
you seriously up your game.

43:29.700 --> 43:32.066
-Huh.
-Mm-hmm.

43:32.066 --> 43:34.233
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

43:34.233 --> 43:35.400
You can play cool
if you want,

43:35.400 --> 43:37.233
but this faÃ§ade's
not fooling me.

43:37.233 --> 43:38.500
You're excited as hell.

43:38.500 --> 43:40.133
[both chuckle]

43:40.133 --> 43:41.433
I'm intrigued.

43:41.433 --> 43:43.000
I do have some questions.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.700
About the comp? Platinum.
State-of-the-art package,

43:45.700 --> 43:48.066
comparable to what
you're making now.

43:48.066 --> 43:50.166
I previewed who you were
without naming you,

43:50.166 --> 43:53.734
and I know it's yours
if you're interested.

43:53.734 --> 43:55.300
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

43:55.300 --> 43:58.166
It's overwhelming, right?
Getting exactly what you want?

43:58.166 --> 43:59.433
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

43:59.433 --> 44:02.467
That's how I roll.

44:02.467 --> 44:05.533
I would insist on
paying you a commission.

44:05.533 --> 44:08.066
I want to do a nice thing.
Let me.

44:08.066 --> 44:09.734
I have to do something.

44:09.734 --> 44:12.133

[flash drive thuds]

44:35.133 --> 44:37.200
There's a move.
Guys try it so often,

44:37.200 --> 44:38.667
we call it the Bojangle.

44:38.667 --> 44:41.266
When someone who's
been caught, like yourself,

44:41.266 --> 44:45.033
agrees to cooperate, then thinks
they can string us along,

44:45.033 --> 44:48.667
giving us nothing until...
what?

44:48.667 --> 44:51.633
Maybe you think we'll lose
interest or somethin'?

44:53.467 --> 44:56.066
Well, that's not gonna
happen ever,

44:56.066 --> 44:58.700
so don't you try
to fucking Bojangle me.

44:58.700 --> 45:03.233
"The price of any betrayal

Gunslinger.

45:09.300 --> 45:11.066
But no less true.

45:11.066 --> 45:16.400
You're right in recognizing
that I...am reluctant.

45:16.400 --> 45:20.467
It makes me sick
to sell out the man

45:20.467 --> 45:24.166
who g-gave me everything...

45:28.000 --> 45:31.166
...so I can
be with my family.

45:31.166 --> 45:34.133
So if that's not
good enough,

45:34.133 --> 45:37.533
you can go fuck yourself!

45:43.767 --> 45:47.133
So you tell me,

45:47.133 --> 45:50.266
you want me to keep
doing what I'm doing?

45:50.266 --> 45:53.200
Yeah. Keep it up.

48:30.066 --> 48:32.433
He basically admits
to driving your kids drunk.

48:32.433 --> 48:34.100
He insults them and you.

48:34.100 --> 48:36.700
We've got the full version now.
No one else does.

48:36.700 --> 48:38.000
What'd it cost?

48:38.000 --> 48:40.266
Well within my budget
for this type of thing.

48:40.266 --> 48:41.667
Well done.

48:41.667 --> 48:44.200
Now we just need to get it

[man] All right,
let's get those tents up!

48:49.700 --> 48:54.066

The full video contained
what the police consider to be

Now is this because
you think my advice

50:58.166 --> 51:01.066
gives you less of a shot
at winning?

51:01.066 --> 51:03.400
No. I need to protect
my integrity.

51:03.400 --> 51:06.300

Not ego. And not alone.

51:20.467 --> 51:22.000
We have more resources

51:22.000 --> 51:24.333
than any governmental

51:25.467 --> 51:28.166
I plan on using them
as I see fit.

51:28.166 --> 51:32.333
Sometimes even I lose
perspective. [exhales]

51:32.333 --> 51:35.300
This whole winning and losing
thing can do that to you.

51:35.300 --> 51:39.567

instead of "the people."

51:41.700 --> 51:44.200
And I forget that history
won't give a shit

if Chuck Rhoades
or Bryan Connerty

51:46.266 --> 51:48.166
won or lost
some dipshit case,

51:48.166 --> 51:49.200
And in a hundred years,

51:49.200 --> 51:50.767
that's what
they'll all look like,

51:50.767 --> 51:52.400
no matter how big.

51:52.400 --> 51:55.066
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

51:55.066 --> 51:57.667
But taken together
as an aggregate,

51:57.667 --> 52:00.367
they matter.

52:03.100 --> 52:05.033
Instead of thinking about
how it's gonna feel

52:05.033 --> 52:08.166
hearing a guilty verdict
only you  brought in,

52:08.166 --> 52:11.500
picture the retirees,
the hourly workers.

52:20.100 --> 52:24.000
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

in the American promise --

what you deserve.

That is the whole reason --

52:42.200 --> 52:48.367
We're sold the idea that
the playing field is level.

52:48.367 --> 52:50.066
But we both know
the playing field

52:50.066 --> 52:53.266
is tilted like a craps table
in Tombstone, Arizona.

52:53.266 --> 52:54.734
[exhales sharply]

who is sewing the legs.

52:58.200 --> 53:00.367
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

53:00.367 --> 53:04.033
Every dollar that he takes
through fraud,

53:04.033 --> 53:06.066
insider information,
market manipulation,

53:06.066 --> 53:08.233
is a dollar taken away
from one of those folks

53:08.233 --> 53:09.266
who earned it.

53:09.266 --> 53:12.500
And Axe will do everything

53:12.500 --> 53:14.300
to keep it all going.

53:14.300 --> 53:18.200
And that's why you need me,
because I am willing

53:18.200 --> 53:22.567
to stare into the abyss
beyond conventional morality

53:22.567 --> 53:25.033
and do what needs
to be done

53:25.033 --> 53:27.500
to even that
fucking table back up.

this moment

54:09.667 --> 54:11.633

54:11.633 --> 54:14.233

possibly now.

the only  thing you
have to ask yourself is,

54:30.700 --> 54:33.734
can you do a better job
