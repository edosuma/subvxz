HOW I'M FEELING,

09:08.900 --> 09:10.367

TAPPING SOUND.

09:10.367 --> 09:13.033
IT'S ME.
LET'S GET ON

OK, MOMENT'S OVER.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.500
GOT A LOT OF WORK
TO DO.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.300
DONNA, THERE'S
A COMMOTION OUTSIDE.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.400

10:06.600 --> 10:09.834
WHAT? RAE,
HOW COULD YOU?

10:15.300 --> 10:17.200
CHELSEA, WHY
ARE YOU DOING THIS?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.100
BECAUSE, RAE,
WE HAVE TO STOP
DONNA CABONNA

10:20.100 --> 10:22.300
FROM USING REAL FUR
ON THAT SWEATER.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.100
Protesters: YEAH!

10:24.100 --> 10:26.300

THAT I DESIGNED?

10:26.300 --> 10:27.700
CHELS, THIS IS MY DREAM.

10:27.700 --> 10:31.100
NOW, WILL YOU
PLEASE LEAVE

10:31.100 --> 10:32.500
FORGET IT, CHELSEA.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.000
SHE'S NOT LISTENING.
WE NEED TO GO TO PLAN "B."

10:35.000 --> 10:37.033
WHAT?
I THOUGHT THIS
WAS PLAN "B."

10:37.033 --> 10:38.300
THIS WAS PLAN "A."

10:38.300 --> 10:41.367
I DIDN'T KNOW
WE WERE GOING IN ORDER.

10:41.367 --> 10:44.667
UH, CAN Y'ALL TALK
ABOUT THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE?

10:44.667 --> 10:46.500
HEY, YEAH.
CHELSEA, UM,

YOU WANT TO COME
TO MY HOUSE?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.200
MY MOM'S MAKING
LENTIL LOAF.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.100
NO, IT'S OK, LEAF.

10:50.100 --> 10:50.900
I THINK WE MADE
OUR POINT.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.133
RAE, I SWEAR
BY OUR FOUNDER
PINEY PETERSON,

10:54.133 --> 10:56.133
IF YOU DO NOT LOSE
THAT FUR,

10:56.133 --> 10:57.133
WE WILL BE BACK.

10:57.133 --> 10:59.300

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:08.867 --> 11:09.934
ALL RIGHT,
HAVE A NICE DAY.

11:09.934 --> 11:11.300
HOW'S OUR COMMOTION COMING?

11:11.300 --> 11:12.500
AH, IT WAS MORE
OF AN ANNOYANCE.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.467
DON'T WORRY,
I HANDLED IT.

11:14.467 --> 11:14.900
GOOD.

11:14.900 --> 11:18.767
DON'T WORRY, DONNA,
I HANDLED IT.

11:21.233 --> 11:22.967
HI, I'M CORY.
AND I'M EDDIE.

11:22.967 --> 11:25.467
AND WE WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT AN AMAZING INVENTION.

11:25.467 --> 11:29.700
GUYS, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU WANTED TO SPEAK
TO A LOVELY YOUNG LADY,

11:29.700 --> 11:30.967
BUT DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY?

11:30.967 --> 11:32.400
I KNOW THIS IS HARD
TO BELIEVE, CORY,

11:32.400 --> 11:34.667
BUT I HAVE
PERSONALLY BEEN IN
THAT PREDICAMENT.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.000
WELL, THAT'S JUST
TOO DARN BAD

11:36.000 --> 11:40.033
THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE POCKET PICKUP MASTER.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.367
YES, NOW LET ME
SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.

11:42.367 --> 11:45.100
Stanley: YOUR EYES
ARE BLUE LIKE THE OCEAN,

11:45.100 --> 11:48.600
AND, BABY,
I'M LOST AT SEA.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.033
HOO HOO HOO.

11:49.033 --> 11:52.934
IF I WERE A LADY
OR A WOMAN OF
THE FEMALE PERSUASION--

11:52.934 --> 11:53.967
WHO WROTE THIS STUFF?

11:53.967 --> 11:55.033
STICK TO MY SCRIPT.

11:55.033 --> 11:57.600
THEN I WOULD DEFINITELY
BE ATTRACTED TO THE MAN

11:57.600 --> 12:00.400
WHO WAS CLEVER ENOUGH
TO BREAK THE ICE
WITH ONE OF THESE.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.500
SO, EDDIE,
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY

12:02.500 --> 12:05.467
FOR A FABULOUS PRODUCT
SUCH AS THIS ONE?

12:05.467 --> 12:06.400
I DON'T KNOW, CORY.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.300
I WOULD PAY HUNDREDS,
PERHAPS THOUSANDS

12:08.300 --> 12:11.600
FOR A PRODUCT
AS WONDERFUL AS THE
POCKET PICKUP MASTER.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.300
YEP, A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD.

12:12.300 --> 12:15.867
BUT IF YOU CALL NOW,
THE POCKET PICKUP MASTER
CAN BE YOURS

12:15.867 --> 12:19.667
FOR THE LOW LOW PRICE
OF 49.95.

12:19.667 --> 12:21.200
49.95!

12:21.200 --> 12:22.800
YOU BLOWING MY MIND!

12:23.867 --> 12:25.667
OK, THE CALLS ARE
STARTING TO COME IN,

12:25.667 --> 12:28.600
WHICH MEANS A LOT
OF YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
START GOING OUT.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.400

NEED CONVINCING,

12:30.400 --> 12:32.200
