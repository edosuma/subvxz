they found a listening device.

If crimes have been committed,

00:15.223 --> 00:17.934
they’re to be investigated

They’re not to be investigated

I don’t want you as a partner.

-Might be time to head home.
-Oh, trying to get rid of me or what?

All right. It’s time to go, John.
I’ll drive you home.

-Come on, it's late.
-How’d you know to find me here?

01:50.443 --> 01:53.321

I saw you through the window.

I say when it’s time to go.

-You’re in no condition to drive, John.

So what were you doing at the bar
at that hour, if you don’t mind my asking?

04:29.560 --> 04:33.189
Got a call from the house
that Clark was having a problem.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.358
It was legit?

In the sense
that he was having a problem? Yeah.

-No.

been doing harassing, upped the ante.

The way this guy’s gotten to me,
if he wanted to kill me,

04:50.915 --> 04:53.459
he wouldn’t take some wild shots
outside a bar.

04:53.751 --> 04:56.254
I guess it’s possible
he was going for Clark.

-Oh, yeah.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.776
Did you notice anything
he might have been involved in?

05:19.694 --> 05:22.238
-Like what?
-A fight, an argument.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.283
I'm telling you the truth,
I was kind of busy last night.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.998
Ah, to hell with it.
He was a pain in the ass last night,

05:32.081 --> 05:34.876
same as he’s been a pain in the ass
for the last four or five weeks running.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.169
What are we talking about?

05:36.753 --> 05:39.839
Getting loaded, sloppy,
getting into arguments.

05:40.214 --> 05:43.885
-It’s one thing after another.
-Did something specific happen last night

05:43.968 --> 05:46.012
that might have led to somebody
coming back with a gun?

05:46.095 --> 05:47.430
I wouldn’t doubt it.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.641
All I can tell you
is that I wish you’d encourage him

05:50.725 --> 05:52.185
to do his drinking someplace else,

05:52.602 --> 05:54.437
because I don’t want to have to be
calling for somebody

05:54.562 --> 05:56.147
to come and pick him up every night.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.234
-You’re the one who called?
-Right, I'm the one that called.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.864
And I hate like hell to have done it.
But at a certain point, enough’s enough.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.992
Can you tell us anyone specific
who Clark might have had a problem with?

06:08.201 --> 06:10.119
-No.
-Is there anyone who could tell us?

-See, I hate this.

Listen, I got a guy
who’s working the door.

He’s an off-duty cop,
he got off before the shooting.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.722
Maybe he saw something before he left.

-We need to talk to him.

only I ain’t giving him up.
I’ll talk to him, explain the situation.

-He wants to come in, it’s up to him.
-That’s not gonna work.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.068

Well, there was apparently enough
an event before,

08:09.572 --> 08:11.782
so, the bartender put in a call
to get you taken out of there.

he’s got a thing about cops.

You have any altercations with anyone
while you were there?

08:21.834 --> 08:23.085

-Any altercations at all?
-No, sir.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.549
I’ll expect you to be forthcoming

08:28.633 --> 08:30.343
through the course
of this investigation, Detective.

Absolutely.

Listen, uh, probably you got other things
on your mind right now,

08:43.147 --> 08:46.943
but should you want to get into it,
I got back some information

08:47.068 --> 08:50.279
on how it is your credit card
was used to order that child pornography.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.740
-How?
-A request for a credit history

08:52.823 --> 08:54.242
from a private investigator.

-Hatcher?
-His agency.

-I don’t know if it was him directly.
-Thanks, Greg.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.334
Doesn’t this make you
like him more for the shooter?

09:03.417 --> 09:04.460
No.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.587
Still think it was more
likely intended for Clark.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.047
-Yeah, right.
-Or random.

09:14.428 --> 09:15.471
What are you doing here?

coming into work

over things in my head.

that makes me feel.

-Doesn't matter.

-Did I hear that you got shot last night?
-It was nothing.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.879
Well, "shot" and "nothing"
don’t exactly go together.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.589

-Why’d you do a credit check on me, Stan?

child pornography,

came from this office.

There’s no bad blood between me and them.

-This goes into my personal life.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.404
If you applied for a loan,

11:36.487 --> 11:38.989
maybe someone was doing a credit check
on behalf of a client.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.700
I didn’t apply for any loan.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.577
-A mortgage, a new job of some kind?
-None of that.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.246
Okay.

11:45.996 --> 11:49.542
The problem is that, even if I ask around,
what it’s gonna come back to,

11:49.667 --> 11:52.878
is that the credit-history request
was made on the behalf of a client.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.132
Now, you know as well as I do
that those are confidential relationships.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.636

who requested that information.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.183
Let me see what I can come up with,
as a personal favor.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.075
JERRY: What time was it
that you went to the bar, Detective?

12:23.617 --> 12:24.994
I got there about 2:30.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.747
-Where had you been up to that point?
-Home.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.624
Kind of late to be going out, no?

12:30.916 --> 12:32.209

12:32.293 --> 12:34.837
saying some guys were giving
Detective Clark a hard time.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.631
I went down there to see
if I could be of any assistance.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.968
-How did the desk sergeant know this?
-He got a call from the bartender.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.263
You get a lot of 2:00 a.m. calls
about Detective Clark?

12:45.097 --> 12:46.891
-This was the first.
-Okay.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.309
So you got there, now what?

12:48.893 --> 12:50.978
Things had calmed down,
I talked to Detective Clark

12:51.061 --> 12:52.772
then the two of us walked out together.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.024
Was Detective Clark impaired
at that point?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.192
No, he was not.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.029
-In your opinion, he was fit for duty.
-Absolutely.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.867
-What happened when you got outside?
-We got maybe 15 yards,

13:04.950 --> 13:07.203
I heard three shots, and I was hit.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.955
Detective Clark took cover,
he checked my condition,

13:10.164 --> 13:12.249
tried to ascertain
where the shots came from,

13:12.333 --> 13:14.418
when that failed,
he called for an ambulance.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.254
Was it Detective Clark’s feeling
that the shooting was related

13:17.379 --> 13:19.048
to whoever had been giving him
a hard time earlier?

13:19.256 --> 13:20.257
He didn’t know.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.137
Lieutenant, has Detective Clark
demonstrated any behavior

13:25.221 --> 13:27.056
that you believe
might have resulted in the shooting?

13:27.223 --> 13:28.307
Not that I’ve observed.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.977
-This doesn’t appear to be a pattern?
-No.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.689
Okay.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.693
We’re gonna let you carry the ball
on this one.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.529
But the files get CC’d to IAB

13:41.654 --> 13:43.489
and if you interview anyone
on the job, let us know.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.033
Obviously,
if there’s any sign of police misconduct,

13:46.242 --> 13:48.369
-we’ll notify IAB immediately.
-Good.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.253
I appreciate you
letting me do this in here,

13:57.419 --> 13:59.797
-instead of under your boss’s nose.
-We appreciate you coming in.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.049
If only they find out
you’re working in a bar,

14:02.341 --> 14:04.677
-they could hurt you.
-LAURA: Nobody’s looking to hurt you.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.639
Well, being a cop, I couldn’t sit back
and not say anything.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.183
-Someone got into it with Detective Clark?
-Right.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.353
Which wouldn’t have been the first time.
I mean, not for nothing.

14:14.603 --> 14:17.690
-He gets a load on, he starts in.
-Starts in how?

14:18.274 --> 14:21.110
He comes on strong with the girls,
whether they’re with someone or not,

14:21.652 --> 14:23.070
gets chesty with whoever.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.197
I cut him some slack,
’cause he’s on the job.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.576
-What about last night?
-Well, last night, I'm not sure.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.911
I know he was getting
very familiar with this girl,

14:31.078 --> 14:33.622
and then some guy come in
and got into it with him about her.

14:33.831 --> 14:34.874
They got into a fight?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.709
Things were definitely heading
in that direction.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.253
So, I stepped in,
told the guy he had to leave.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.714
-The girl left with him.
-How pissed off was he when he left?

14:42.339 --> 14:45.676
He was plenty pissed off.
Whether it was at the girl or at Clark,

14:45.801 --> 14:46.886
that I don’t know.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.096
Any idea how we can get in touch
with this girl?

14:49.346 --> 14:52.433
I don’t, but only ’cause Clark
was inside the ten yardline

14:52.558 --> 14:53.601
right there in the bar,

14:53.684 --> 14:55.811
there’s a chance he might know
how to get in touch with her.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.147
Thanks for the help.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.941
Look, guys,
you gotta keep my name out of this.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.484
We’ll do our best.

15:03.777 --> 15:07.114
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

15:14.788 --> 15:16.206
Got a second, John?

15:19.668 --> 15:20.711
He know anything?

15:20.794 --> 15:23.005
He said you got into it
with some guy over a girl.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.298
Got into it? No.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.300
LAURA: He said you were making
out with some girl,

15:26.383 --> 15:28.552
a guy showed up, and he
had to get between the two of you.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.513
-Did it occur to you that was his version?
-What’s your version?

15:32.640 --> 15:35.976
I was talking to a girl,
a guy showed up, he was a little miffed.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.436
I bowed out gracefully, that was it.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.688
This girl you were talking to,
any idea how we can contact her?

15:39.813 --> 15:42.024
I just told you what it was,
why would you want to contact her?

15:42.316 --> 15:43.901
We’re conducting an investigation here,
John.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.236
You’re right, you’re right.
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:48.280 --> 15:51.283
(SIGHS) Let’s see, here.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.078
Yeah, I think that’s from last night.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.422
Can I help you?

16:05.547 --> 16:08.842
(CLEARS THORAT)

16:09.009 --> 16:12.554
-What are we talking about?
-High-end, professional-grade equipment.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.182
-You carry that?
-Somebody you want to nail?

16:16.725 --> 16:17.768
The owner around?

16:17.935 --> 16:19.895
Hey, guy, you know,
I can help you with whatever you need.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.021
Let me talk to the owner.

-(CARS HONKING)
-(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

16:26.610 --> 16:30.155
Hey, you installed a security system
at the IPI Agency?

16:30.698 --> 16:33.450
I don’t divulge that kind of thing,
Detective.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.954
All right,
what can you tell me about this bug?

16:38.664 --> 16:41.834
It’s a TTS 2400.

16:42.459 --> 16:46.213
Loses a little range in bad weather,
other than that, extremely dependable.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.048
-You sell them?
-Yeah.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.550
Who’d you sell this one to?

16:49.717 --> 16:52.803
D... Detective, do you understand
the nature of my business?

16:52.970 --> 16:55.431
I don’t care about that.
I want you to go through your records.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.391
I want the name of the person
that you sold this to.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.767
When people come to me,

16:58.851 --> 17:02.646
they come to me with an expectation
of absolute confidentiality.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.649
If I have to get a court order,
I'm gonna tear this place apart.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.736
Any illegal wiretapping,
spying, or stalking

17:08.861 --> 17:10.988
done with any of your equipment,
I am gonna nail you for.

17:11.071 --> 17:14.491
You and I both know,
as long as what I sell is legal to sell,

17:14.575 --> 17:17.244
there’s no criminal liability
based on what’s done with it.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.872
Now, I'm used to dealing
with law enforcement, Detective.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.249
Please don’t try to intimidate me.

17:27.171 --> 17:30.632
(SIGHS) Somebody’s after me.
They know things about me.

17:30.966 --> 17:34.511
They planted this in a car I use
and got information from my personal life

17:34.595 --> 17:36.430
and used it with my eight-year-old son.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.685
-What happened to him?
-He got into a car with a stranger,

17:41.810 --> 17:45.522
got ridden around and dropped off.
That was this time.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.616
Serial number’s still intact.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.578
I’ll go through my records,
I’ll call you with whom I sold it to.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.246
Thank you.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.999
When it comes to kids, all bets are off.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.631
Where were you last night, Chris?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.592
CHRISTINE: I was working
on a paper at the library,

18:13.675 --> 18:15.886
and then I met some friends
to go eat.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.262
Where was that?

18:17.679 --> 18:19.598
This place, the Old Stand,
where we go to sometimes.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.683
Did you meet anyone at the Old Stand?

18:23.143 --> 18:25.395
-I don’t know, like who?
-Like a guy?

18:26.563 --> 18:29.358
I talked to a guy for a little while,
it wasn’t like a big deal or anything.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.401
Do you have a boyfriend
who showed up last night

18:31.527 --> 18:33.445
and got into an argument
with the guy you were talking to?

18:33.570 --> 18:35.447
-No, I don’t.
-Christine...

18:35.823 --> 18:37.199
-Huh?
-A detective was shot

18:37.491 --> 18:38.784
outside of the Old Stand last night.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.869
Now, we don’t know how much
you know about that.

18:41.161 --> 18:44.123
-I don’t know anything about that.
-This guy you were talking to,

18:44.373 --> 18:46.375
who we understand
you were more than just talking to,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.293
may have been the intended target.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.672
If it was your boyfriend
who was responsible for the shooting,

18:51.755 --> 18:53.590
the best way to help him
is to let us know that.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.803
-I told you, I don’t have a boyfriend.
-Christine, stop it.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.638
We have an eyewitness account
of a guy showing up

18:59.721 --> 19:01.056
and pulling you out of the bar.

19:02.182 --> 19:06.562
Oh, that was my father.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.524
Why was your father there?

19:10.691 --> 19:13.694
Because I'm underage,
and I was using a fake I.D,

19:13.819 --> 19:15.696
which, I guess now I’ll get busted for.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.365
According to him,
I’ve abused drugs and alcohol,

19:18.490 --> 19:20.409
and I shouldn’t be drinking, period.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.161
LAURA: How’d he know you’d be at this bar?

19:22.369 --> 19:25.080
He tracked me down. He managed to walk in

19:25.164 --> 19:26.915
right when I happened
to be kissing this guy,

19:26.999 --> 19:28.458
who I'm sure I’ll never see again,

19:28.584 --> 19:30.794
thanks to my father
totally humiliating me.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.546
That’s my dad.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.798
-He drove you home?
-Right.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.426
-What’d he do after that?
-(SCOFFS) I don’t know.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.555
Smoked a million cigarettes,
sat at the kitchen table.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.807
He came into my room
to make sure I was still there.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.477
-Did he leave the house?
-Not that I know of.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.527
Whoa, wait a minute.

19:56.403 --> 19:59.406
Are you thinking it was him
that shot somebody?

19:59.615 --> 20:00.616
We don’t know yet.

20:00.908 --> 20:05.662
Oh, no, he would not shoot anybody.
He doesn’t have a gun.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.955
Not that you know of.

20:07.122 --> 20:11.210
No, he would not shoot anybody.
Oh, my God, he’s my father, okay?

20:11.335 --> 20:12.586
He was just worried about me.

20:12.669 --> 20:16.215
He... he is doing the best
that he can to raise me

20:16.298 --> 20:19.092
since my mother split.
He was just looking after me.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.845
Is there anyone
who can vouch for your father being home

20:21.929 --> 20:25.349
-between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 a.m.?
-Yeah, I can.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.604
I got up in the middle of the night.
I went... I went to his room.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.356
I wanted to see if he was still mad at me.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.025
He was asleep,
so, I didn’t want to wake him.

20:35.734 --> 20:40.739
-Was he there in the morning?
-Yeah. Yeah, he was there in the morning.

20:42.324 --> 20:47.079
He’s always there in the morning.
He made me breakfast, went to work.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.930
-You Burt?
-BURT: What do you need?

21:05.013 --> 21:06.056
First thing I need

21:06.181 --> 21:08.141
is for you to get your head out
from under that dashboard.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.143
Ain’t there anybody behind the counter?

21:11.687 --> 21:13.897
You ever install anything besides stereos?

21:14.398 --> 21:15.732
-Like what?
-Like a bug.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.235
-No.
-Like this bug.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.487
I never saw it before.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.322
You might wanna be thinking about

21:22.447 --> 21:24.825
when the guy that sold it to you,
picks you out of a lineup.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.119
-I don’t know what you’re talking about.
-When that happens,

21:27.244 --> 21:29.037
you’re gonna need
all the help you can get.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.498
-I do installations.
-Who told you to install this?

21:31.665 --> 21:35.002
-I... I don’t know, I don’t keep track.
-Was it Stan Hatcher?

21:36.336 --> 21:37.754
I was told it was not illegal

21:37.879 --> 21:39.840
to have these installed
in your own car, all right?

21:39.923 --> 21:42.259
Was I misinformed about that?
If so, I'm sorry.

21:42.342 --> 21:46.179
-Was it Stan Hatcher?
-Yeah.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.516
What did he tell you?

21:50.851 --> 21:53.353
It wasn’t enough,
I thought my wife was going out on me,

21:53.770 --> 21:56.815
I had to run up a 5,000 dollar bill
for him to prove to me she was.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.526
-He said he’d wipe out the bill?
-Yeah.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.446
-What else did you do for the five grand?
-Nothing.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.031
I don’t think that’s true, Burt.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.575
I didn’t monitor the transmissions
from the thing, he did.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.077
That’s right, he did.
He gathered information

22:09.161 --> 22:11.913
based on conversations
that took place in that car.

22:12.372 --> 22:13.832
And then someone used that information

22:13.999 --> 22:17.169
to talk an eight-year-old boy
into taking a ride.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.714
-What are you saying, that that was me?
-That eight-year-old boy was my son.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.551
And if he has to, he will definitely
pick you out of a lineup.

22:25.552 --> 22:29.389
Kidnapping is a class A felony
in the state of New York, Burt!

22:29.514 --> 22:31.558
Do you know how much
prison time you’re looking at?

22:31.641 --> 22:33.310
Do you want to hear what he told me?

22:34.728 --> 22:36.730
He said some woman wanted
to convince her husband

22:36.813 --> 22:37.898
they were vulnerable.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.442
Convince him that, whatever they spent
for security was worth it.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.486
Hatcher told me to pick up the kid,

22:42.611 --> 22:44.780
drive him around for 15 minutes,
and drop him off.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.448
He told me
the kid’s mother knew all about it.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.408
Did Hatcher give you a shield to use?

22:50.118 --> 22:52.245
I swear to God, I wasn’t mean to the kid.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.049
HATCHER: I thought of something
that happened a while back.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.259
I don’t know if it has to do
with this or not.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.846
What’s a while back? Two, three weeks ago.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.140
-Something to do with John Clark?
-(SCOFFS)

23:13.517 --> 23:15.102
This guy was coming into the bar
for a while,

23:15.727 --> 23:18.397
sort of a semi-regular, short, nerdy.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.565
If I had to guess,
I’d say he was an accountant,

23:20.690 --> 23:23.777
worked for an insurance company,
like that.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.655
There was this girl he was working,
a looker,

23:27.072 --> 23:29.866
tall, blonde, great body, career-type.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.828
(SCOFFS) Unless he had a lot more money
than he was showing,

23:32.911 --> 23:34.538
not the type he was used to scoring with.

23:34.704 --> 23:38.291
But when I say he was working her,
I mean buying her drinks, dinner.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.795
It looked for a while there
like he was doing her taxes.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.171
Clark beat him to the punch?

23:44.548 --> 23:47.884
He got up to go to the bathroom,
Clark moved in like a panzer division.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.429
I remember watching
the guy come back to his seat,

23:50.595 --> 23:51.680
try to stay in the game,

23:51.972 --> 23:54.558
and then have Clark and the blonde
waltz out of the place together.

23:54.641 --> 23:58.437
-Wasn’t this a couple weeks ago?
-Until last night, the guy stayed away.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.939
He have any contact with Clark last night?

24:01.898 --> 24:03.024
Not that I saw.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.694
I thought I should just mention
he came in last night.

24:05.777 --> 24:08.238
And you’re thinking the guy might have
nursed something all that time?

24:08.864 --> 24:11.491
I saw his face the night
Clark took off with the girl.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.411
He could nurse this
for the rest of his life.

24:20.750 --> 24:25.088
-We need the name of a girl, John.
-Yeah? One without normal appetites?

24:25.714 --> 24:28.175
You met about two weeks ago in a bar,
then went home with her.

24:30.051 --> 24:34.139
-Tall blonde, late 20s, early 30s.
-She supposed to be the shooter now?

24:34.431 --> 24:36.433
There’s a guy you might have
pissed off by taking her home.

24:36.516 --> 24:39.936
-I have no idea of any of that.
-She’s like a lawyer or something.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.483
-This was when?
-About two weeks ago.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.319
She might have been
with a group from her office,

24:47.444 --> 24:50.655
-who she left to go sit with this guy.
-Who she left to be with you.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.033
-Blonde.
-GREG: Right.

24:53.200 --> 24:57.078
Yeah, I remember her.
Her name was Corrine or Colette.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.748
(CHUCKLES) Let me tell you, Greg,

24:59.873 --> 25:01.917
this is one you’d sell
your family into slavery for.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.836
-Last name?
-Never knew her last name.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.173
-You know where she lives?
-Yeah, London Terrace.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.509
That’s like a square block,
London Terrace.

25:10.592 --> 25:15.013
Yeah, she had a corner apartment.
It was, uh, 9th avenue and 23rd street.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.099
We took the stairs,
it was on the third floor.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.393
That ought to do it.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.450
-Get in the car.
-What are you doing?

25:35.534 --> 25:37.702
Get in the car
or I'm gonna kill you right here.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.121
Thought you coming to me for help
with the credit card thing.

25:40.205 --> 25:44.084
-Signaled a new spirit of cooperation.
-You thought wrong, get in.

-Get out.
-No.

26:04.854 --> 26:05.897
Get out.

26:12.153 --> 26:14.656
-What are you doing?
-Don’t you say anything.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.121
There may be some doubt
in your mind what I'm capable of.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.206
I'm here to put that doubt to rest.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.211
-Andy, take it easy...
-I said don’t say anything!

26:30.797 --> 26:33.675
Now, you have resentments against me,
I understand this.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.927
To you, they’re justifiable,
to me, they’re not.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.804
That’s not gonna be resolved between us,

26:37.971 --> 26:40.432
and that has nothing to do
with what I'm about to tell you.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.768
You involved my family.

26:44.603 --> 26:48.607
You crossed the last line.
This gun is untraceable.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.901
You involve them again,
I will use it to kill you.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.280
-Do you believe I'm capable of that, Stan?
-Yeah.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.699
Do you understand
that I have never been more serious

26:57.824 --> 26:58.908
about anything in my life?

26:59.034 --> 27:02.704
You’ve got a gun to my neck.
I get that you’re serious.

talk to you about it.

We’re trying to locate a guy, uh,

28:46.141 --> 28:47.809
you might have gotten to be
friendly with in there.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.145
-Who’s that?
-Well, we don’t know his name.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.606
Does he have a particularly
distinguishing characteristic?

28:53.732 --> 28:57.277
-We know he’s short.
-I'm not big on short.

28:59.028 --> 29:01.531
And, uh, he was covering your bar tab

29:01.614 --> 29:05.201
up until the night, John Clark came along.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.955
I don’t need anyone to cover
my bar tab, Detective.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.958
Well, we’re not saying you needed him to,
we’re just saying he did.

29:12.459 --> 29:15.462
You got to be friendly with him
over a period of time,

29:15.545 --> 29:18.423
and it’s possible that
he was helping you out with something, um,

29:18.590 --> 29:20.049
maybe your taxes.

29:20.508 --> 29:21.926
Larry Matelka.

29:22.469 --> 29:25.096
And it wasn’t my taxes.
It was a real-estate investment trust

29:25.221 --> 29:27.515
he was explaining to me
in excruciating detail.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.058
What about him?

29:29.768 --> 29:31.853
-Well, do you know where he lives?
-God, no.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.646
Know where we might be able
to find him?

29:34.105 --> 29:36.483
I'm sure he must have given me his card
at least six times.

I haven’t thrown out yet?

29:38.735 --> 29:39.611

he turned over tapes and transcripts

30:10.725 --> 30:12.227
with times, dates, and locations.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.355
Are you interested in hearing
what he was doing to me,

30:15.438 --> 30:16.648
or doesn’t that make any difference?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.567
exactly what he’s supposed to be doing,

without the attitude.

-Hatcher did that?
-He was responsible for having it done.

30:52.225 --> 30:56.563
I got a statement from the guy
he had approach Theo and install the bug.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.274
You’re talking about multiple felonies
Hatcher committed.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.650
-That’s right.
-Which is why

31:00.733 --> 31:02.694
this should have been approached
in an official capacity,

31:02.819 --> 31:04.028
instead of the way you did it.

It’s a little tough to hold back
when it comes to your kid.

31:09.617 --> 31:10.660
I'm sure it is.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.081
And I don’t take any pleasure
in doing what I have to do here.

-What are we talking about, Jerry?
-Menacing, reckless endangerment,

it’s up to the D.A.
whether they file criminal charges.

I’d say at a minimum, though,
we’re looking at a departmental trial.

Why is that of interest to the police,
if you don’t mind me asking?

32:08.259 --> 32:10.595
Well, there’s an incident
involving this girl and your name came up.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.513

knew anything about it.

-Well, who’s the girl?
-Corrine O’Malley.

32:16.392 --> 32:17.644
-Blonde?
-Right.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.901
you might have been
stuck on her there for a while.

32:25.818 --> 32:26.861
This is New York.

to get stuck on anybody.

Hmm, so, there never came a point
you got irritated

32:32.408 --> 32:35.078
that you spent all this time
and all this money on her,

32:35.286 --> 32:37.163

swoop in and score?

32:37.789 --> 32:39.332

you must have at least thought
was a relationship.

-Something that would lead to something?

32:52.095 --> 32:55.264
No way, <i>José.</i> I'm on the prowl,
here today, gone tomorrow.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.976
But what happened, Larry?
You go to the bathroom,

32:58.101 --> 32:59.644
suddenly, it’s the other guy
she’s looking at.

32:59.727 --> 33:02.271
-The other guy she's flirting with.
-The other guy she goes home with.

33:02.438 --> 33:04.482
-More power to him.
-Is that what you thought at that time?

33:04.607 --> 33:07.110
-He’s a player, I'm a player.
-You’re not a player, Larry.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.407

I’ll be right back.

-Why am I not a player?

33:18.705 --> 33:21.958
Because you’re not.
You’re a guy who wants women to like him,

-and you got your feelings hurt.
-You gotta be kidding me.

33:24.794 --> 33:28.589
I went out with a hooter’s waitress,
and I broke up with her.

-Oh, my God, that’s him.
-BALDWIN: Are you sure?

33:34.595 --> 33:35.555
Definitely, that’s him.

-(DOOR CLOSES)
-What was that all about?

33:43.479 --> 33:45.690

you could shoot somebody

33:45.773 --> 33:47.650
in the middle of New York
and not have anyone see you?

33:47.734 --> 33:48.818
I didn’t shoot anybody.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.863
That gentleman was in his apartment
across the street from the bar.

33:52.113 --> 33:55.992
He was awake, smoking a cigarette.
He looked outside, and he saw you.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.245
Listen to me, Larry.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.667
You shot a cop.
And we don’t think you’re a bad guy.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.836
We think you’re a good guy
who did a dumb thing

34:06.919 --> 34:08.087
under emotional duress.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.548
Now, you get in front of it,
a judge will understand.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.592
You keep stonewalling,
you’re looking at serious time.

34:15.970 --> 34:19.682
-He acted like I wasn’t even there.
-Who did?

34:21.726 --> 34:24.228
I actually do notice it
when people ignore me.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.648
-Most people do.
-I don’t know about most people.

34:28.107 --> 34:30.151
I know that, on those rare occasions

34:30.234 --> 34:32.361
when I get invited to dinner
at someone’s house

34:32.612 --> 34:34.947
or I'm attending a wedding
or a bar mitzvah,

34:35.156 --> 34:37.450
and disappointment registers on the face.

34:37.658 --> 34:40.411
of whoever it is
assigned a seat next to me, I notice it.

34:41.662 --> 34:43.998
I don’t say anything about it,
but I notice it.

34:44.457 --> 34:46.918
What this guy did
is a lot worse than that.

34:48.544 --> 34:51.672
So I went home, crawled into my hole

34:51.798 --> 34:54.801
and promised myself
I’d never set foot in that bar again.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.385
Until the other night.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.264
I thought maybe she’d be there.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.852
Maybe she’d be wondering
what happened to me.

35:06.813 --> 35:11.442
-Instead, you saw him.
-With his hands all over some other girl.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.446
-BALDWIN: Where was the gun, Larry?
-In my apartment.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.658
I went to get it, I came back.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.786
I looked in the window,
and I saw he was still there.

35:22.411 --> 35:25.331
I waited across the street,
when he came out, I shot at him.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.794
Is that officer hurt bad?

35:30.419 --> 35:32.839
He’s gonna be okay,
but you could have killed him.

35:33.005 --> 35:35.383
Oh. I'm very sorry.

Detective Sipowicz told me isn’t true,

35:50.773 --> 35:51.899
he can set it straight.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.276
From what I understand,

35:53.359 --> 35:55.570
Detective Sipowicz has put himself
in a world of hurt.

-Brought it on himself.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.453
your uncle might wanna make
his own determination about.

36:04.787 --> 36:06.622
Well, what is it
Detective Sipowicz is saying?

36:07.582 --> 36:08.791
A credit-history request,

36:08.958 --> 36:11.085
conclusively attributed
to your nephew’s agency,

36:11.169 --> 36:13.588
enabled Detective Sipowicz’s
credit card to be used

36:13.713 --> 36:15.882
to order child pornography
in Sipowicz’s name.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.217
-That true?
-I didn’t do it.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.970
He’s been given a statement
by a Burt Savaro,

36:21.137 --> 36:23.347
which I’ve seen,
that describes how your nephew

36:23.639 --> 36:25.558
pressured him into planting
an illegal listening device

36:25.683 --> 36:27.518
in Detective Sipowicz’s department car,

36:27.643 --> 36:29.520
and then using information
derived from that bug

36:29.604 --> 36:32.690
to talk Detective Sipowicz’s
eight-year-old son into his car.

36:32.940 --> 36:33.983
Why would I do all this?

36:35.276 --> 36:37.653
I think you did it
to destroy Sipowicz’s career

36:37.778 --> 36:39.614
the same way you think he destroyed yours.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.909
Started small
to get him nervous and paranoid.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.577
And you were careful but not too careful,

36:44.785 --> 36:47.038
so, with a little digging,
it led back to you.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.789
And then, when you had his kid snatched

36:48.873 --> 36:50.416
and Sipowicz did
what you knew he would do,

36:50.541 --> 36:52.501
you were waiting there
with your tape recorder.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.962
-Who’s this guy, Perry Mason?
-Shut your mouth, Stan.

36:55.630 --> 36:56.881
Based on what we both know

36:56.964 --> 36:59.175
About your nephew’s previous conduct,
Chief,

36:59.467 --> 37:01.260
does what I said seem all that unlikely?

37:04.096 --> 37:07.892
(SIGHS) What do you propose
as a solution, Lieutenant?

37:11.854 --> 37:13.814
Bury whatever there is
on Detective Sipowicz,

37:13.940 --> 37:17.401
in return for which, no criminal charges
are filed against your nephew,

37:18.736 --> 37:20.529
assuming Detective Sipowicz is willing.

37:20.863 --> 37:23.115
He threatened me with a gun,
I have proof of that.

37:23.449 --> 37:25.701
And he has proof
you committed a half a dozen felonies.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.204
-You want to go head-to-head, Stan?
-Yeah, I want to go head-to-head.

37:28.287 --> 37:31.624
I want to take that son of a bitch down,
once and for all.

37:34.001 --> 37:35.461
In which case, here’s what’s gonna happen.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.839
Sipowicz will very likely
get fired off the job,

37:38.923 --> 37:42.677
possibly have charges brought,
won’t get convicted, won’t do time.

37:42.885 --> 37:45.763
You, on the other hand,
will absolutely be brought up on charges,

37:45.930 --> 37:48.891
will make an unsympathetic defendant,
and will definitely do time.

37:49.100 --> 37:52.353
-I’d plan on eight to ten years.
-Can we talk about this privately?

37:53.354 --> 37:57.692
Here is the only way you’ll avoid that,
you don’t get to live in New York anymore.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.610
Your agency’s got an office in Miami.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.655
They’ll put through the paperwork
to get you a PI license in Florida,

38:02.738 --> 38:04.407
and that’s where you’re gonna live.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.993
You don’t got near Sipowicz
for the rest of your life.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.119
And, if you’re smart,

38:08.327 --> 38:10.496
you’ll keep your contact with me
to a bare minimum.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.209
Lieutenant,
I think our business here is concluded.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.473
Clark, in my office.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.572
-You wanna be here?
-What do you mean?

38:44.822 --> 38:46.324
The way you’ve been conducting yourself

38:46.407 --> 38:48.284
leaves me with the impression
you don’t want to be here.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.995
-I definitely wanna be here.
-Then you’re gonna have to show me that.

38:51.620 --> 38:54.165
The clearance rates on my cases
are as high as they’ve ever been, boss.

38:54.373 --> 38:58.294
I'm not talking about your clearance rate,
I'm talking about you coming in hung over,

38:58.836 --> 38:59.837
hitting the bars at night,

39:00.046 --> 39:01.922
sleeping around,
and nearly getting your partner killed.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.466
You think I don’t feel bad about that?

39:03.591 --> 39:06.761
I don’t care what you feel.
I care what you do.

39:07.136 --> 39:10.264
From this point forward,
I find you going out on a jag at night,

39:10.514 --> 39:12.183
I'm transferring you out of my squad.

39:12.892 --> 39:13.893
-Yes, sir.
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)

39:14.393 --> 39:15.436
Come in.

39:17.855 --> 39:18.856
We’re finished.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.573
If you’re willing
to let what you have on Hatcher go,

39:27.656 --> 39:29.241
the tape recordings will disappear.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.621
-What does Hatcher say?
-Hatcher’s gonna do what he’s told.

39:34.163 --> 39:37.166
That means relocating out of New York,
steering clear of you and your family.

39:38.334 --> 39:40.336
-Fine.
-That’s it, then.

39:45.257 --> 39:46.258
(CLEARS THROAT)

39:47.468 --> 39:49.887
I appreciate you interceding
like this, Lieutenant.

39:51.847 --> 39:53.349
I don’t want your appreciation.

39:54.308 --> 39:57.436
After assuring me that you wouldn’t
freelance the situation with Hatcher,

39:57.520 --> 39:58.729
you did exactly that.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.024
I guess, at a certain point,
my emotions got the better of me.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.902
I understand, which is why
I went to bat for you.

40:05.945 --> 40:09.365
What I want you to understand
is how contemptible I felt doing it.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.827
I don’t take any satisfaction
in brokering deals.

40:13.744 --> 40:16.705
I live by rules. I honor my commitments.

40:16.956 --> 40:20.292
While you remain in my command,
you will do the same.

40:21.168 --> 40:23.254
If you assume
that you’ve won me as a confederate

40:23.462 --> 40:24.588
and act on that assumption,

40:24.672 --> 40:27.216
your leaving the job may come
sooner than you think.

40:31.554 --> 40:32.555
That’s all.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.400
-Hey.
-Hey there, John.

40:46.193 --> 40:49.155
-Oh, you feel like going to the gym?
-I can’t.

40:49.905 --> 40:52.366
-An hour, 45 minutes?
-Can’t do it, John.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.494
-How ’bout dinner?
-(LOCKER DOOR SHUTS)

40:57.872 --> 40:58.873
Listen, man...

41:01.292 --> 41:03.961
I don’t want to make up any phony excuses
and I don’t want to preach to you,

41:04.879 --> 41:06.422
but the way you’ve been acting bothers me.

41:08.132 --> 41:11.260
It disrespects the people you work with,
it disrespects the job.

41:12.094 --> 41:14.096
And you’re so screwed up,
I don’t know if you realize it.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.558
-I guess that’s a no for dinner.
-That’s right.

You put through that request
for reassignment?

41:41.373 --> 41:43.042
(CLEARS THROAT) Didn’t get a chance.

41:44.919 --> 41:46.337
Can I ask if maybe you could hold off?

41:47.421 --> 41:51.592
I mean, if there’s not somebody
that you’re set on working with

41:51.675 --> 41:54.595
or until you find somebody
that you’re set on working with?

41:57.723 --> 42:02.770
I would make every effort
to not behave the way I’ve been behaving.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.773
I know that probably
rings a little hollow right now,

42:05.856 --> 42:08.442
but if you could
just kind of struggle along with me.

42:12.905 --> 42:13.948
We’ll try it.

42:17.785 --> 42:18.786
Thank you.
