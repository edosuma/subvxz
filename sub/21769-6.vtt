WEBVTT

00:02.636 --> 00:04.538
CAN WE WATCH
SOMETHING ELSE?

00:04.605 --> 00:07.007
FERN LOVES WATCHING
"TRADING SPACES."

00:08.909 --> 00:10.844
I KNOW,

00:10.911 --> 00:13.847
BUT FERN HAS SEEN
THIS ONE NINE TIMES.

00:13.914 --> 00:16.683
THIS IS FERN'S
FAVORITE EPISODE.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.386
HER COUSIN FICUS
IS IN IT.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.389
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
SINCE FAMILY IS INVOLVED,

00:22.456 --> 00:24.825
I GUESS WE CAN
WATCH IT AGAIN.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.827
YOU KNOW,
HAVING FERN IS LIKE

00:26.894 --> 00:28.762
OUR OWN PERSONAL
HOME MAKEOVER.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.764
YOU'RE RIGHT.
AUNT HONEY'S APARTMENT

00:30.831 --> 00:32.766
DOES FEEL MORE LIKE HOME
SINCE WE GOT HIM.

00:32.833 --> 00:36.336
MAKE ROOM, GIRLS.
I'M MOVING IN.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.505
HUH?

00:38.572 --> 00:40.040
I'M HAVING MY
APARTMENT REPAINTED.

00:40.107 --> 00:42.042
IT'LL JUST BE
FOR A FEW DAYS.

00:42.109 --> 00:44.111
DON'T MIND ME.
I TRAVEL LIGHT.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.015
THANK YOU, BOYS.

00:48.081 --> 00:50.017
THEY'RE NOT
INSURED OR BONDED,

00:50.083 --> 00:53.020
BUT THEY'RE GOOD
TO LOOK AT.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.021
FEEL FREE TO TAKE
JO'S ROOM.

00:54.087 --> 00:56.023
OH, NO, MINE'S PROBABLY
REALLY MESSY.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.926
YOU'D BE BETTER OFF
IN GEORGIA'S ROOM.

00:58.992 --> 01:02.029
WELL, ACTUALLY I'M GOING
TO NEED BOTH ROOMS--

01:02.095 --> 01:04.131
ONE TO SLEEP IN
AND ONE TO MEDITATE.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.068
I'M NOT AN ANIMAL.
OH, AND GET RID OF
THAT PLANT.

01:08.135 --> 01:10.504
FERN?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.039
I DON'T ALLOW
LIVING VEGETATION
IN MY APARTMENT.

01:12.105 --> 01:15.108
PLANTS STEAL OXYGEN
FROM HUMANS.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.346
AS A SCIENTIST,
I CAN DEFINITIVELY TELL YOU

01:19.413 --> 01:20.948
THAT PLANTS
DO THE OPPOSITE.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.016
YOU HAVE YOUR THEORY.
I HAVE MINE.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.320
MOVE IT OUT.

01:26.386 --> 01:30.057
I HAVE TO ORGANIZE
FOR MY CHARITY EVENT.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.125
I RAISE MONEY
FOR PORN.

01:34.394 --> 01:37.297
PORN NEEDS MONEY?
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S DOING WELL.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.032
NOT PORN,

01:39.099 --> 01:42.169
P-W-O-R-N--

01:42.236 --> 01:46.039
THE POOR WOMEN'S OUTREACH
RESOURCE NETWORK.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.977
OH, IT'S A FAVORITE
CAUSE OF MINE.

01:51.044 --> 01:55.716
SO YOU'RE REALLY
INTO PWORN?

01:56.116 --> 01:59.753
I CHAIR
THE GALA COMMITTEE.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.322
SO WHAT,
DOES THAT MAKE YOU,

02:02.389 --> 02:03.056
LIKE, A PWORN STAR?

02:03.123 --> 02:07.861
I WORK VERY HARD
AT THIS CAUSE.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.096
WOW, HARD CORE.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.034
OKAY, YOU GET ONE MORE.
CHOOSE IT WELL.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.170
OKAY OKAY...

02:16.236 --> 02:18.305
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

02:29.116 --> 02:32.920
WE HAVE BEEN INVADED
BY AUNT HONEY.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.422
HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE KITCHEN?
DID YOU SEE THE REFRIGERATOR?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.858
SHE THREW OUT
ALL OF THE FOOD

02:37.925 --> 02:40.360
AND REPLACED IT
WITH CHAMPAGNE.

02:40.427 --> 02:43.263
YOU KNOW WHAT WILL
TAKE THE EDGE OFF?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.999
A NICE BOWL OF BRAN FLAKES
AND BUBBLY.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.070
BOOKS. HMM.

02:50.137 --> 02:54.208
OH MY GOODNESS,
SHE HAS A SIGNED COPY

02:54.274 --> 02:56.610
OF THE KING JAMES BIBLE.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.046
- WHO SIGNED IT?
- KING JAMES.

02:59.112 --> 03:02.850
WHAT? LET ME SEE.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.651
OH, NO, THAT SAYS
"KEVIN JAMES."

03:04.718 --> 03:06.119
"THE KING OF QUEENS" DUDE?

03:08.655 --> 03:11.758
OH, BANK STATEMENTS.
I WONDER WHAT THAT IS.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.060
OH, IT'S JUST
BANK STATEMENTS.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.062
( GASPS )
THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL

03:15.128 --> 03:18.232
AND PERSONAL.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.000
DO YOU NOT WANT TO KNOW
HOW MUCH SHE'S WORTH?

03:20.067 --> 03:22.669
- YES, PLEASE.
- OKAY.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.005
UM, AS OF LAST WEEK,

03:25.072 --> 03:27.674
SHE'S WORTH 42...

03:27.741 --> 03:29.042
MILLION?

03:29.109 --> 03:32.145
TRILLION?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.147
...CENTS.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.518
SHE-- SHE ONLY HAS
42Â¢ IN HER ACCOUNT.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.052
42Â¢? NO NO NO,
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

03:39.119 --> 03:44.391
NO, AUNT HONEY IS PRETTY MUCH
DOWN TO A MCNUGGET.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.194
AUNT HONEY: YOU CAN.
YOU CAN PLAN AND PLAN, JULES,

03:47.261 --> 03:50.631
BUT YOU CAN STILL
LOSE EVERYTHING JUST LIKE THAT.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.634
OH, SO WALK ME THROUGH IT.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.802
HOW DO FORECLOSURES WORK?

03:55.869 --> 03:58.972
OH, I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.

04:01.108 --> 04:04.111
WHAT IS GOING ON?

04:04.178 --> 04:06.113
JULES IS HER
FINANCIAL ADVISOR.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.048
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S GIVING
HER ADVICE ON BEING BROKE.

04:08.115 --> 04:11.251
BUT NO NO NO, THAT CAN'T BE,
CAN IT? I MEAN--

04:11.318 --> 04:13.487
WELL, SHE'S GETTING
HER APARTMENT REPAINTED.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.390
MAYBE SHE'S DOING IT
IT GOES INTO FORECLOSURE.

04:16.456 --> 04:19.860
NO NO NO, THERE HAS TO BE
SOME OTHER EXPLANATION.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.328
I MEAN, IF SHE WAS
GOING BROKE,

04:21.395 --> 04:23.297
WHY WOULD SHE BE DOING
ALL THIS CHARITY WORK?

04:23.363 --> 04:26.166
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO HAS DEVOTED
COUNTLESS HOURS TO PWORN.

04:28.468 --> 04:31.238
- THAT IS A REALLY BAD NAME.
- YEAH.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.740
( PHONE RINGING )

04:36.510 --> 04:39.279
HELLO.
PWORN PARTY HEADQUARTERS.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.250
SHE TOLD ME I HAD TO SAY THAT
WHEN I ANSWERED THE PHONE.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.052
YEAH. NO, SHE'S NOT
HERE RIGHT NOW.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.421
MAY I PLEASE
TAKE A MESSAGE?

04:47.487 --> 04:50.457
OH YEAH, SURE.
I'LL TELL HER.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.094
THAT WAS
A COLLECTIONS AGENCY.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.028
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
AUNT HONEY.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.564
NO WAY.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.099
I SWEAR
ON THE KEVIN JAMES.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.313
HOW DO YOU THINK
THIS HAPPENED TO HER?

05:13.380 --> 05:17.384
WE JUST HAD CHICKEN NOODLE
CHAMPAGNE SOUP.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.854
AND WE ATE IT
WITH SILVER SPOONS.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.357
I TOLD LIZA, "I WILL
HANDLE YOUR PORTFOLIO,

05:23.423 --> 05:24.925
BUT THAT IS ALL
I'M HANDLING.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.594
I AM NOT TAKING YOU
TO THE OPERA."

05:27.661 --> 05:31.465
WELL, I'LL GIVE HER THIS--
THE WOMAN HAS A TYPE.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.799
WELL...

05:34.668 --> 05:37.104
GIRLS, YOU REMEMBER
MY DEAR FRIEND

05:37.171 --> 05:40.440
AND FINANCIAL ADVISOR
JULES BROUSSARD.

05:40.507 --> 05:45.312
- YES YES YES.
- ( GIGGLING )

05:45.379 --> 05:47.481
AND NO.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.850
WHAT-- WHAT-- WHAT--
WHAT'S HAPPENING UP HERE?

05:49.917 --> 05:52.119
OH, IT'S UNCOMBABLE
HAIR SYNDROME.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.087
I'VE HEARD OF THAT.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.657
IT'S THE NATION'S
12TH LEADING KILLER
OF CONVERSATION.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.827
AUNT HONEY, I HAVE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

06:00.894 --> 06:04.765
YOU GOT A PHONE CALL
FROM A COLLECTIONS AGENCY.

06:04.831 --> 06:08.569
OH, THOSE VULTURES.
IF THEY CALL AGAIN,
JUST HANG UP ON THEM.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.537
BUT THEY'RE JUST
GONNA CALL BACK.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.539
IT'S A COLLECTIONS AGENCY.
IT'S NOT LIKE

06:12.606 --> 06:15.509
A NO-RUSH-JUST-CALLING-
TO-SAY-HI AGENCY.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.345
GEORGIA, THIS DOES NOT
CONCERN YOU.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.013
BUT IF ANYTHING'S WRONG,
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.015
THANKS,
BUT AT THIS POINT

06:22.082 --> 06:24.117
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU COULD DO.

06:24.184 --> 06:27.154
DO YOU ALSO HAVE
UNMATCHABLE CLOTHES
SYNDROME?

06:28.322 --> 06:30.858
COME ON, JULES,
I WANT TO SHOW YOU

06:30.924 --> 06:32.926
HOW WE'RE DOING
WITH THE PAINTING.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.565
THIS IS A DISASTER.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.802
I KNOW. YOU PUT THIS
IN MY MATCHING PILE.

06:41.869 --> 06:45.506
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO TO HELP AUNT HONEY.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.475
FIND AN OLD RICH GUY
WITH A HEART PROBLEM?

06:50.444 --> 06:52.379
NOW WE'RE BRAINSTORMING.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.248
YES! OKAY.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.383
<i>( DOORBELL RINGS )</i>

06:58.886 --> 07:00.387
- HI.
- HI.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.389
I HAVE A PACKAGE FOR
THE APARTMENT UPSTAIRS,

07:02.456 --> 07:03.824
BUT NO ONE'S ANSWERING.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.893
- OKAY, I'LL SIGN FOR IT.
- THANK YOU.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.528
- THERE YOU GO.
OH, SORRY.
- OH, OKAY.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.463
CAREFUL. THAT THING'S
INSURED FOR $60,000.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.498
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.833
ALL RIGHT.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.405
$60,000?

07:18.472 --> 07:20.607
IS MY PARENTS' HOUSE
IN THERE?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.483
IT'S A VASE.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.219
THAT GRANTS WISHES?

07:32.286 --> 07:34.521
IT JUST DID.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.090
I WISHED THAT I COULD FIND
A WAY TO HELP AUNT HONEY

07:37.157 --> 07:39.092
AND I FOUND IT.

07:39.159 --> 07:43.497
WE ARE GOING TO
PREVENT HER FROM SPENDING
MONEY SHE DOESN'T HAVE.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.200
- WE ARE?
- YES, WE ARE GOING TO
TAKE THIS BACK

07:46.266 --> 07:48.168
AND GET THE MONEY
BACK FOR IT.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.270
IT IS UP TO US TO
PROTECT HER FROM HERSELF.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.472
BECAUSE AUNT HONEY
IS A PROUD WOMAN,

07:52.539 --> 07:55.008
BUT THEY DO NOT
SERVE PRIDE

07:55.075 --> 07:58.045
AT THE SOUP KITCHEN.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.047
- THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
- YEAH?

08:00.113 --> 08:01.949
I WASN'T SURE
WHERE YOU WERE GOING,

08:02.015 --> 08:05.686
- BUT YOU REALLY PULLED IT
TOGETHER IN THE END.
- YOU LIKE THE EXIT?

08:05.752 --> 08:08.589
AREN'T MY PAINTERS
DOING A FANTASTIC JOB

08:08.655 --> 08:11.892
WITH MY SIGNATURE
SEAFOAM GREEN?

08:11.959 --> 08:14.628
THEY'RE DOING
A FANTASTIC JOB OF PAINTING
WITH THEIR SHIRTS OFF.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.097
OH, WELL,

08:17.164 --> 08:19.132
THEY'RE NOT INSURED
OR BONDED,

08:19.199 --> 08:21.535
BUT THEY'RE GOOD
TO LOOK AT.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.440
YOU KNOW, AFTER YOU ACQUIRE
THAT FORECLOSED APARTMENT
ABOVE YOU,

08:26.507 --> 08:28.942
I VOTE YOU BRING THOSE BOYS
BACK IN AGAIN.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.012
OH, POOR DR. FELDMAN.

08:32.079 --> 08:35.516
HEY, LIKE YOU SAID,
YOU CAN PLAN AND PLAN

08:35.582 --> 08:37.518
AND STILL LOSE EVERYTHING
JUST LIKE THAT.

08:37.584 --> 08:41.488
YES, WELL, NOW THAT
YOU'VE MOVED ALL MY MONEY
TO THAT BANK IN BARBADOS,

08:41.555 --> 08:45.225
I CAN BUY HIS APARTMENT
WITH WHAT I SAVE ON TAXES.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.427
OH, YOU WANT TO SEE
SOMETHING FUNNY?

08:47.494 --> 08:48.695
( LAUGHS )

08:48.762 --> 08:51.999
LOOK. LOOK AT MY LAST
BANK STATEMENT

08:52.065 --> 08:53.667
AFTER YOU MOVED
EVERYTHING.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.570
42Â¢?
OH, THAT'S A SCREAM.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.672
( BOTH LAUGHING )

09:06.446 --> 09:08.048
MAY I HELP YOU, LADIES?

09:08.115 --> 09:09.850
YES, WE HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THIS VASE.

09:09.917 --> 09:13.120
THAT'S AN EXCEPTIONAL
TANG DYNASTY PIECE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

09:13.187 --> 09:15.622
IT CLASHES WITH ALL OF OUR
OTHER OVERPRICED CRAP.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.026
YES, SO WE'D LIKE
TO RETURN IT.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.761
- YEAH...
- GREAT.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.963
...NO.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.465
WE HAVE A STRICT
NO-RETURN POLICY.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.234
I CAN OFFER YOU
A STORE CREDIT.

09:27.301 --> 09:30.237
OOH, OKAY OKAY.
DO YOU SELL CASH?

09:30.304 --> 09:33.140
SO IF WE'RE
ALL DONE HERE...

09:33.207 --> 09:35.442
NO NO NO, WE'RE NOT DONE.
SEE, I HAPPEN TO KNOW

09:35.509 --> 09:37.945
THAT MY AUNT HONEY
HAS BEEN

09:38.011 --> 09:41.014
ONE OF YOUR BEST CUSTOMERS
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.382
YES, SHE HAS.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.384
AND IF<i>SHE</i>WANTED
TO RETURN THAT VASE,

09:44.451 --> 09:46.820
I WOULD MAKE AN EXCEPTION
FOR HER.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.857
BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO.
THAT'S WHY JO AND I HAD
TO SNEAK IT DOWN HERE.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.859
OH, SO YOU WANT ME

09:51.925 --> 09:54.595
- TO GIVE YOU $60,000...
- PREFERABLY IN CASH.

09:54.661 --> 09:57.497
...FOR AN ITEM
THAT YOU'VE TAKEN
FROM ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER.

09:57.564 --> 10:00.667
EXACTLY.
SO HOW DO WE DO THIS?

10:00.734 --> 10:02.402
IS THERE, LIKE, AN A.T.M.,
A CHECK? WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:02.469 --> 10:04.438
- YEAH...
- AWESOME.

10:04.505 --> 10:05.472
...NO.

10:05.539 --> 10:07.774
OKAY, THAT ONE
WAS ON ME.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.177
I AM NOT TAKING
THIS VASE BACK.

10:10.244 --> 10:11.778
BUT I WILL CALL
YOUR AUNT HONEY

10:11.845 --> 10:14.014
TO MAKE SURE SHE KNOWS
WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN HERE.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.450
NO NO NO, PLEASE DON'T.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, 
'CAUSE SHE'S IN BIG TROUBLE.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.587
UH, THAT WOULDN'T
HAPPEN TO BE

10:20.654 --> 10:23.457
A PART OF THE IKEA
DYNASTY, WOULD IT?

10:24.892 --> 10:27.060
- YEAH...

THE END OF AN ERA.

10:40.674 --> 10:45.512
LET'S GO WITH DERBY RED.

10:45.579 --> 10:50.250
I ENJOY COLORS THAT
REMIND ME OF STALLIONS.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.754
WELL, I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT IF WE'D ONLY USED
TWO COATS

10:53.820 --> 10:56.089
INSTEAD OF THE SIX
YOU REQUESTED....

10:56.156 --> 10:58.592
I KNOW.
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

10:58.659 --> 11:02.262
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WASTED ALL MY GREEN.

11:04.064 --> 11:07.568
COULDN'T YOU JUST HAVE
SAVED A LITTLE BIT?

11:07.634 --> 11:11.405
I GUESS I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO SELL
ALL OF MY FURNITURE

11:11.471 --> 11:13.307
NOW THAT I'LL BE
LIVING IN THE RED.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.543
OH, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA CHANGE.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.946
OKAY, THIS IS GOOD.
THIS IS GOOD.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.381
YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE CHANGE.
SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP?

11:21.448 --> 11:24.918
WELL, I HAVE TO GET
THIS APARTMENT READY

11:24.985 --> 11:29.323
FOR THE POOR WOMEN'S
OUTREACH RESOURCE
NETWORK GALA.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.258
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST ORGANIZING IT.

11:31.325 --> 11:32.659
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
HOSTING THE EVENT?

11:32.726 --> 11:34.428
YES.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.364
FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T
FIND A HOTEL IN THIS TOWN

11:37.431 --> 11:39.566
THAT'D LET ME HOST
A PWORN EVENT.

11:41.635 --> 11:45.105
OKAY, CAN SOMEONE ELSE
MAYBE HOST IT THIS YEAR?

11:45.172 --> 11:48.475
AND HAVE PEOPLE THINK
I DROPPED OUT OF PWORN?

11:48.542 --> 11:51.478
THAT'LL BE A SCANDAL.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.847
MY CIRCUMSTANCES
MAY BE CHALLENGED,

11:53.914 --> 11:58.252
BUT I WILL SPARE
NO EXPENSE TO MAKE SURE

11:58.318 --> 12:00.654
THIS IS THE GREATEST
GALA OF THE YEAR.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.422
OKAY, AUNT HONEY, WAIT.
WAIT WAIT WAIT.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.958
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LET JO AND I

12:05.025 --> 12:06.727
ORGANIZE IT FOR YOU?

12:06.793 --> 12:08.729
AND WE'LL BE ABLE
TO HAVE A CLEAR MIND

12:08.795 --> 12:10.597
ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE,
GIVEN YOUR...

12:10.664 --> 12:12.466
CHALLENGED
CIRCUMSTANCES THING.

12:12.533 --> 12:17.604
WELL, I WASN'T LOOKING
FOR A HANDOUT, BUT...

12:17.671 --> 12:20.541
THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS
OF MY CATERER,

12:20.607 --> 12:22.543
MY FLORIST

12:22.609 --> 12:24.545
AND A HUMAN STATUE,

12:24.611 --> 12:28.515
WHO ISN'T CHEAP,
BUT HE MAKES ME GIGGLE.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.051
( LAUGHING )

12:33.187 --> 12:35.522
THAT'S FUNNY STUFF.
THAT'S FUNNY STUFF.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.824
WAIT WAIT WAIT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:37.891 --> 12:41.094
WHAT? I AM
GETTING RID OF THESE
OVERPRICED PARTY PEOPLE.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.797
WE'RE GONNA DO IT
OURSELVES, JO, AND SAVE
AUNT HONEY SOME MONEY.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.867
OKAY, DO YOU REALIZE
THAT RIPPING IT UP
DOESN'T CANCEL THEM?

12:46.934 --> 12:49.570
WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY
GIVE THEM A CALL.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.305
OH MAN.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.941
ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.543
WE JUST NEED
A BIG BOTTLE OF WINE
AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF TAPE.

13:07.788 --> 13:11.458
AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU GIRLS TOOK THE REINS
OF THIS PARTY FOR US?

13:11.525 --> 13:13.560
HEY, GIDDYUP.
HOW DID WE DO?

13:13.627 --> 13:16.196
IT'S COME UP LAME
AND I WISH I COULD SHOOT IT.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.633
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE HAVE SNACKS...

13:19.700 --> 13:23.237
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU HAVE-- SNACKS.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.839
WHERE IS
THE TUNA SASHIMI?

13:25.906 --> 13:28.575
IT'S BACK IN THE '90S
WITH YOUR HIGH-TOP FADE.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.646
THESE DAYS WE LIKE
TUNA SURPRISE.

13:32.713 --> 13:34.681
THERE'S NO TUNA ON THIS.

13:34.748 --> 13:37.985
SURPRISE!

13:38.051 --> 13:40.821
WHERE IS
THE STRING QUARTET?

13:40.888 --> 13:42.523
STEREO.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.658
- THE COAT CHECK?
- BANNISTER.

13:44.725 --> 13:46.827
THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN?

13:46.894 --> 13:49.329
A BUNCH OF CANDY BARS
ON THE RADIATOR.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.731
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.466
IT'S ACTUALLY
THE BEST THING HERE.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.502
CAN'T BE WORSE THAN
YOUR CHINESE VODKA

13:55.569 --> 13:57.504
WHICH IS BURNING A HOLE
THROUGH MY PAPER CUP

13:57.571 --> 13:59.039
AND MY FINGERS.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.111
OKAY, PHASE ONE--
SAVE HONEY MONEY.

14:04.178 --> 14:06.113
WE THREW THIS PARTY
FOR $74.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.115
I'D SAY THAT'S
A CHECK-OFF.

14:08.182 --> 14:09.883
AND NOW PHASE TWO--
MAKE HONEY MONEY.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.686
ARE YOU SURE
THAT WE SHOULD BE

14:12.753 --> 14:14.488
TRYING TO SELL OFF
ALL OF HER FURNITURE?

14:14.555 --> 14:16.557
WELL, THE BANK'S GONNA
TAKE IT ALL ANYWAY.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.959
WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO GET
SOME MONEY FIRST, RIGHT?

14:19.026 --> 14:21.828
OH, LOOK, THERE'S A POSSIBLE
CLIENT BY THE SOFA.

14:25.499 --> 14:27.434
- HI.
- HI.

14:27.501 --> 14:29.436
- ( BOTH GIGGLE )
- GOOD PARTY.

14:29.503 --> 14:31.605
- YEAH.
- MM-HMM.

14:31.672 --> 14:34.541
HEY, DID YOU TRY
THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN YET?

14:34.608 --> 14:36.710
YOU SHOULD GET IN THERE
BEFORE IT SLIDES
DOWN THE WALL.

14:36.777 --> 14:39.046
OH.
( LAUGHS )

14:40.747 --> 14:42.115
THIS IS A NICE SOFA.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.651
YES, IT'S LOVELY.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.921
IT IS LOVELY, ISN'T IT?
DO YOU WANT TO BUY IT?

14:47.988 --> 14:49.723
- EXCUSE ME?
- YEAH, I MEAN,

14:49.790 --> 14:51.725
THIS IS PART OF OUR
FUNDRAISING EFFORTS.

14:51.792 --> 14:54.061
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.562
OH, COME ON.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.131
I CAN JUST SEE YOU
CHILLING ON THIS COUCH

14:58.198 --> 14:59.733
WITH YOUR MAN
OR YOUR WOMAN,

14:59.800 --> 15:03.170
WHATEVER YOU DO.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.938
RIGHT HERE,

15:05.005 --> 15:07.541
TOUCH IT. EH?
MAKE ME AN OFFER.

15:07.608 --> 15:10.377
THANKS, BUT I REALLY
DON'T NEED IT.

15:10.444 --> 15:12.646
WOW, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL COUCH.

15:12.713 --> 15:16.049
IF IT WERE FOR SALE,
I WOULD PAY AT LEAST $1400--

15:16.116 --> 15:18.685
$1800 FOR IT.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.154
OH, I AM SORRY,

15:21.221 --> 15:23.590
STRANGER WITH
EXQUISITE TASTE,

15:23.657 --> 15:26.960
BUT MY CLASSY
LADY FRIEND HERE

15:27.027 --> 15:29.530
HAS ALREADY GOT
HER EYE ON IT.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.565
SO I'M SORRY.

15:31.632 --> 15:34.635
LOOKS LIKE $1800
IS THE PRICE TO BEAT.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.470
- I'LL GIVE YOU $2000.
- DEAL.

15:36.537 --> 15:38.605
HOW ARE YOU DOING
ON LAMPS?

15:38.672 --> 15:40.908
CLINK CLINK CLINK.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.546

16:00.694 --> 16:04.464
WHAT IS THIS FLIMSY PARTY
MY GUESTS ARE IN?

16:04.531 --> 16:07.134
AUNT HONEY,
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU.

16:07.201 --> 16:09.403
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS CALL THE NUMBERS.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.471
YEAH, BUT DO YOU KNOW
HOW EXPENSIVE THEY ARE?

16:11.538 --> 16:14.041
YES, AND SO DO
MY GUESTS.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.310
- THAT'S THE POINT.
- BUT--

16:16.376 --> 16:20.280
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET
MY HUMAN STATUE?

16:21.615 --> 16:22.749
OH.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.152
JULES, I'M READY
FOR MY SPEECH.

16:25.219 --> 16:28.655
CLINK CLINK CLINK.

16:28.722 --> 16:31.758
WE ARE ALL HERE TONIGHT
FOR ONE REASON--

16:31.825 --> 16:33.694
WE LOVE PWORN.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.898
NO ONE LOVES PWORN
MORE THAN I DO.

16:37.965 --> 16:41.568
THAT IS WHY
FOR EVERY DOLLAR
PLEDGED TONIGHT

16:41.635 --> 16:44.304
I WILL DONATE THREE.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.708

16:49.977 --> 16:52.880
OH, I CANNOT WAIT
TO WRITE

16:52.946 --> 16:56.583
A MASSIVE AMOUNT
ON THIS MASSIVE CHECK.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.553
PHASE THREE?

16:59.620 --> 17:02.155
INTERVENTION.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.858
- AUNT HONEY.
- YES, DEAR?

17:04.925 --> 17:07.060
SO I DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GONNA HAVE TO
SAY THIS TO YOU

17:07.127 --> 17:09.396
FOR, LIKE,
ANOTHER 25 YEARS,

17:09.463 --> 17:12.866
BUT I'M PULLING THE PLUG
ON YOU.

17:12.933 --> 17:14.768
HI, EVERYONE.

17:14.835 --> 17:18.438
TO MOST OF YOU
POVERTY IS SOMETHING
YOU ZOOM PAST

17:18.505 --> 17:20.440
IN YOUR EXPENSIVE CARS

17:20.507 --> 17:22.643
OR YOU FLY OVER
IN YOUR LITTLE HELICOPTER,

17:22.709 --> 17:25.812
BUT POVERTY IS CLOSER
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

17:25.879 --> 17:28.348
IT IS ACTUALLY
IN THIS VERY APARTMENT.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.617
AND HER NAME

17:30.684 --> 17:32.819
IS AUNT HONEY.

- HER NAME IS WHAT?

17:37.424 --> 17:38.592
THAT'S RIGHT.

STOP LIVING THIS LIE.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.669

CLINKETY-CLINK.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.405
AUNT HONEY,
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.241

WE ARE GOING TO RIP UP
THIS CHECK.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.547
WHOO! IT'S A TWO-PERSON JOB.

18:00.614 --> 18:03.016
- SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST HELP ME OUT, JO?
- SHOULD I GO THIS WAY?

18:03.083 --> 18:06.220
EVERYBODY,

18:13.660 --> 18:15.696

A PROBLEM.

TWO OF THEM.

19:23.697 --> 19:27.267
HAS BEEN-- OH, LET'S CALL
IT PERFORMANCE ART.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.636
WHY?

19:29.703 --> 19:32.673
WHY?
TO PROVE A POINT

19:32.739 --> 19:36.109
THAT ANYBODY CAN FALL
INTO POVERTY.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.779

THIS VALUABLE LESSON,

19:38.846 --> 19:40.614
I WANT YOU
TO GIVE GENEROUSLY,

TO PWORN.

WE HAVE GOT TO FIND

19:59.633 --> 20:01.802
A NEW NAME
FOR THIS CHARITY.

WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER
IF YOU JUST GOT 
A CLEANING CREW?

20:11.278 --> 20:12.980
IT WOULD,
BUT I THOUGHT

20:13.046 --> 20:15.883
YOU WERE TEACHING ME ABOUT
HOW TO LIVE ON A BUDGET.

20:15.949 --> 20:19.019
WELL, SINCE WE HELPED YOU
RAISE THE MOST MONEY

20:19.086 --> 20:21.355
THAN THE CHARITY
HAS EVER RECEIVED,
CAN WE CALL IT EVEN?

20:21.421 --> 20:23.156
EVEN?

20:23.223 --> 20:25.359
YOU COST ME A SOFA,
A CHAIR

20:25.425 --> 20:28.095
AND 60 GRAND
IN A BROKEN VASE.

20:29.096 --> 20:30.998

TO LOOK OUT FOR ME

GET INTO A JAM,

I WILL ALWAYS BE
STRAIGHT WITH YOU ABOUT IT.

THAT WE DON'T GET.

JUST CANCEL IT?
- I LIKE IT.
