00:11.485 --> 00:14.155
You're probably wondering why I brought you here today.

00:14.265 --> 00:16.045
- Not really. - Check it!

00:16.045 --> 00:19.085
All the richest people in history have drinks named after them.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.625
Shirley Temple, Arnold Palmer, John F. Lemonade.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.915
What drink's gonna make me rich you ask?

00:23.915 --> 00:26.435
I'll tell you what! One can of RadiCola,

00:26.435 --> 00:29.935
frozen fruit juice concentrate, a dash of hot sauce...

00:30.095 --> 00:34.425
Sugar Roasted Sugar Bombs for texture, and the rest...

00:36.195 --> 00:40.005
Mordecai, witness The RigJuice!

00:40.055 --> 00:42.005
Dude, I don't think you should drink that.

00:47.585 --> 00:49.905
My face feels like magic.

00:49.905 --> 00:51.215
Dude, wanna taste?

00:51.315 --> 00:54.365
I'm not dumb enough to drink that stuff.

00:54.365 --> 00:56.795
Come on, we do dumb stuff all the time!

00:56.795 --> 00:58.275
We're like two peas in a pod.

00:58.275 --> 01:01.105
No we're not.. I'm definitely smarter than you.

01:01.105 --> 01:03.305
It's been that way ever since you dropped out of high school.

01:03.305 --> 01:04.125
Dude what?

01:04.155 --> 01:06.275
I don't need no high school education.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.695
You can't use everything from school in everyday life.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.865
Hey, Mordecai and Rigby. I got a question for you.

01:11.945 --> 01:15.285
So, you know those six turtles at the park petting zoo?

01:15.285 --> 01:17.525
Each one needs a turtle fence.

01:17.525 --> 01:20.765
Assuming each turtle needs nine square feet of space,

01:20.765 --> 01:23.205
I need you guys to figure out the minimum number

01:23.205 --> 01:25.825
of nine foot planks used for construction.

01:26.895 --> 01:28.405
Whoa, Whoa, slow down, Benson.

01:28.405 --> 01:30.115
Rigby can't answer that question.

01:30.115 --> 01:32.285
He doesn't have a high school diploma.

01:32.285 --> 01:33.845
You don't have a diploma?

01:33.845 --> 01:37.035
Thanks for wasting my time. Where's Skips? I'll go ask him.

01:37.035 --> 01:38.185
Ask Skips what?

01:38.185 --> 01:41.355
Oh, just about some math problem that Rigby doesn't know how to solve.

01:41.355 --> 01:42.515
STOP TALKING!!!

01:42.515 --> 01:45.915
Just because I couldn't solve some math problem, doesn't make you more smarter than me!

01:45.915 --> 01:47.615
Check that grammar, bro!

01:47.725 --> 01:51.085
"More Smart", not "More Smarter".

01:51.095 --> 01:52.985
Didn't you learn that in high school?

01:52.985 --> 01:53.895
LEARN THIS!!

01:53.895 --> 01:57.265
A high school diploma never got nobody nothin' and that's a fact!

02:00.715 --> 02:02.235
Free Burgers!

02:02.235 --> 02:05.355
Free Burgers for all high school graduates!

02:05.745 --> 02:10.315
I'm a high school graduate! I got my diploma right here!

02:15.705 --> 02:16.865
NOOO!

02:21.175 --> 02:21.935
No,

02:22.555 --> 02:24.695
wait! I've got my diploma!

02:24.835 --> 02:27.005
Come baack!

02:28.175 --> 02:29.665
You misspelled "Diploma" dude.

02:32.395 --> 02:34.565
That's it! I'm going back to high school!

02:35.485 --> 02:37.095
Eh, doesn't sound like a good idea to me.

02:37.125 --> 02:39.355
Our friendship wouldn't work if we're both smart.

02:39.355 --> 02:40.805
What? What are you talking about?

02:40.805 --> 02:42.665
We're both the same amount of smart as each other!

02:42.665 --> 02:43.765
No, you're not!

02:43.765 --> 02:45.885
I'm the smart one, and you're my friend.

02:45.885 --> 02:47.215
That's our dynamic, dude.

02:47.225 --> 02:49.215
I have a High School diploma, and you don't.

02:49.215 --> 02:52.555
I'm gonna get my diploma, and we'll see how you like being the dumb one!

02:55.535 --> 02:59.375
Well, class, this is quite possibly the hardest math problem in the world,

02:59.485 --> 03:00.855
whoever can solve it

03:01.005 --> 03:04.725
will be leaving the classroom today with a diploma in their hands

03:07.875 --> 03:09.635
Did you say diploma?

03:22.065 --> 03:23.855
That... is correct!

03:23.855 --> 03:25.665
Congratulations, Rigby,

03:25.665 --> 03:29.435
you won't need to go near another school for the rest of your life!

03:33.345 --> 03:34.825
- RIGBY! - Huh? Wha?

03:38.285 --> 03:39.585
Can I get my diploma now?

03:40.035 --> 03:41.545
Get outta my class, Rigby.

03:44.155 --> 03:46.835
- You fell asleep in class, didn't you? - SHUT UP!

03:46.835 --> 03:49.435
You wouldn't fall asleep so much if you had your High School diploma

03:51.905 --> 03:53.885
That lousy High School diploma.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.945
I can get my diploma the easy way, online.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.865

04:05.715 --> 04:06.945
First question:

04:07.135 --> 04:10.445
Which of the following is not a square?

04:12.535 --> 04:14.155
This is too hard.

04:19.255 --> 04:20.885
I WANT MY DIPLOMA!

04:22.735 --> 04:24.615
Ads go away now!

04:25.505 --> 04:29.685

04:42.735 --> 04:45.435
Will see results in thirty to forty days!

04:45.435 --> 04:46.195
What?!

04:46.195 --> 04:49.165
I'll just drink a month's worth of doses, I mean it doesn't say not to.

05:24.665 --> 05:26.475
I Know This Now.

05:26.935 --> 05:31.455
Wait A Minute I Know Everything.

05:35.095 --> 05:37.995
Hey, I know something that can help you with that crossword.

05:38.045 --> 05:40.305
It's called a High School diploma.

05:40.305 --> 05:42.105
Very amusing Mordecai.

05:42.145 --> 05:45.405
缺缺缺Perhaps you can assist me with this.

05:45.725 --> 05:48.625
Tell me, what's an eight letter word for idiot?

05:48.735 --> 05:50.805
What? Why are you talking like that?

05:50.805 --> 05:53.575
I tried imbicule,bonehead, peabrain,

05:53.715 --> 05:57.385
oh wait! I got it. Mordecai.

05:57.665 --> 06:00.805
You're the idiot! You Dumbface!

06:01.395 --> 06:06.065
I'm afraid while dumbface fits, it's simply too stupid to fit in this puzzle.

06:06.065 --> 06:09.825
Face it Mordecai, I'm the smartest now.

06:11.595 --> 06:13.885
What is that? That isn't RigJuice!

06:14.445 --> 06:16.235
- BrainMax? - Get your hands off that!

06:16.235 --> 06:16.965
Gimme that!

06:25.545 --> 06:29.045
First of all, I wanna contradict your earlier statement, Rigby.

06:29.945 --> 06:32.135
This theory proves you're dumber than me.

06:34.085 --> 06:36.065
As you can see by my encounter theory,

06:36.065 --> 06:37.935
it is you, that you are dumber than me.

06:38.035 --> 06:42.435
Tsk. Tsk. Wait till you see my 20 page research paper backing up with my theory.

06:42.435 --> 06:46.615
Tsk. Tsk. I'm gonna write a 21 page paper backing up my theory

06:46.625 --> 06:48.315
AND prove yours wrong!

06:48.315 --> 06:49.785
Tsk. Tsk. Is that so.

06:49.785 --> 06:50.895
Tsk. Tsk. Yeah!

07:24.785 --> 07:28.365
In closing, you're theories had failed to prove that you're smarter.

07:28.635 --> 07:31.835
For your brain is no bigger than a walnut.

07:34.965 --> 07:36.685
Very funny Mordecai,

07:36.705 --> 07:38.335
but your paper is fundlementally flawed

07:38.345 --> 07:42.725
because your brain is made of 99% K9 butt cheeks.

07:46.085 --> 07:49.005
There is still one fuerable truth.

07:49.205 --> 07:51.385
You don't have a High School diploma,

07:51.395 --> 07:55.305
so I'm smarter than you. You imbecile.

08:03.305 --> 08:04.875
I am not an imbecile!

08:06.485 --> 08:09.775
If a diploma will prove that I'm smarter than you, than so be it!

08:12.035 --> 08:13.305
I can't read it!

08:13.395 --> 08:15.335
Probably because you're still too stupid.

08:15.335 --> 08:16.225
Here.

08:16.635 --> 08:18.535
What kind of writing is this?

08:18.535 --> 08:20.825
Mordecai. Rigby. You guys-

08:25.105 --> 08:29.425
Mordecai! Rigby! Get downstairs right now and clean down the mess you made

08:29.425 --> 08:30.865
or I'm gonna fire you-

08:32.544 --> 08:34.195
Dude, what is he saying?

08:41.525 --> 08:45.245
Oh no. We've become so smart, they're stupid to us.

08:53.775 --> 08:56.775
If you haven't made fun of me so much, none of this would've happened!

08:56.775 --> 08:59.675
Whatever. If you cant even get your diploma because we're so smart.

08:59.675 --> 09:00.915
So what's the point.

09:01.075 --> 09:04.485
You're right. There is no point.

09:05.015 --> 09:08.335
What's the point of being so smart, if you can't even understand anyone.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.515
We have to get stupid again.

09:10.515 --> 09:11.125
How?

09:11.425 --> 09:12.825
RigJuice.

09:13.105 --> 09:14.245
The fridge.

09:23.315 --> 09:24.445
The RigJuice!

09:24.985 --> 09:26.055
Pour me some.

09:28.145 --> 09:30.275
It looks... different now.

09:30.415 --> 09:31.245
Ready.

09:31.295 --> 09:34.765
Wait. If I drink this, I'll never get my diploma.

09:34.815 --> 09:36.765
Dude, it's just a piece of paper.

09:36.765 --> 09:40.095
I know that, but you'll never stop making fun of me for it.

09:40.095 --> 09:43.175
I don't care, I won't make fun of you for it I promise...

09:43.275 --> 09:44.705
To being stupid?

09:45.895 --> 09:48.405
To being stupid. Bottoms up.

09:52.455 --> 09:53.295
...Did that work?

10:06.405 --> 10:10.855
And if you stop goofing off and clean up this graffiti now

10:10.855 --> 10:13.135
I'm gonna tear you from limb to limb!

10:13.965 --> 10:16.055
Do you have anything to say for yourselves?

10:16.105 --> 10:17.975
What just happened??

10:18.025 --> 10:20.145
I don't remember anything...

10:20.275 --> 10:23.485
Me and Fives were practicing for our pie contest,

10:23.525 --> 10:27.295
when you dudes came and were speaking Spanish or something.

10:28.405 --> 10:30.255
Then you drink that green stuff.

10:30.975 --> 10:34.195
I can't believe you made me drink your lame drink.

10:34.205 --> 10:37.385
Better get started, or it's getting out of your paycheck.

10:37.385 --> 10:38.815
Yeah, losers!

10:39.085 --> 10:41.315
You know, maybe if you had a High School diploma,

10:41.315 --> 10:43.025
we wouldn't be in this mess.

10:43.065 --> 10:44.395
Well guess what,

10:44.475 --> 10:48.045
this drop out somehow got you to drink RigJuice.

10:49.865 --> 10:51.165
I'll get the paint.

10:57.215 --> 10:59.575
That's good RigJuice.
