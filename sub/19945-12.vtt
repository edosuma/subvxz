WEBVTT

00:48.298 --> 00:51.593
She was trying to talk for ten minutes,
but couldn't get any words out.

00:51.677 --> 00:54.054
It wasn't ten minutes.
Maybe one minute.

00:54.137 --> 00:57.140
See? She has no memory of it.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.059
Okay, you can go ahead
and lower your arms.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.811
Good. Now repeat after me:

01:00.894 --> 01:03.188
"The sky is always blue in San Diego."

01:03.272 --> 01:06.733
You know, everyone says that,
but we have our share of overcast days.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.069
Please just do what she says, Frankie.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.531
Fine. The sky is always blue in San Diego.

01:19.246 --> 01:22.791
Okay. Uh, well,
I'm not seeing any facial paralysis,

01:22.874 --> 01:25.210
no weakness in the arms
and no slurred speech.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.962
You can't be saying there's nothing wrong.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.214
There's a number of things
we can't diagnose in the field.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.800
It could've been anything
from some neurological event

01:31.883 --> 01:33.385
to an anxiety attack.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.678
Bingo. I pick that one.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.638
Have you been under
a lot of stress lately?

01:36.722 --> 01:38.765
I can't talk about it right now.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.476
Okay. Let's get you to the hospital,
get you checked out,

01:41.560 --> 01:44.521
-then you'll know what it is.
-Nope. No thanks.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.898
-Yeah, I'll follow in your car.
-Who are you texting?

01:46.982 --> 01:48.942
-Your family.
-No, no, no.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.570
You're gonna scare everyone
for no reason.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.656
-I'm not sick. I'm not going.
-I don't recommend that.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.034
-I don't either.
-What is this, Yelp?

01:57.117 --> 02:00.704
Okay, well, if you're refusing care,
I'm gonna need you to sign this release.

02:00.787 --> 02:06.043
-She's not refusing care, she's just--
-Happily refusing care.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.212
All right, move it along.
Nothing to see here.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.506
The sky is always blue in San Diego.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.675
-Just step aside.
-Frankie, Frankie.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.927
-Where do you think you're going?
-Home.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.596
How?

02:20.140 --> 02:25.854
Theater's not for fags!
Theater's not for fags!

02:25.937 --> 02:31.026
I have come to the conclusion
that one useless man is a disgrace,

02:31.109 --> 02:34.279
that two are called a law firm.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.782
And that three or more become a Congress.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.743
And, by God, I have had this Congress!

03:23.412 --> 03:25.497
Will someone shut this man up!

03:25.580 --> 03:28.375
Never. Never!

03:34.506 --> 03:36.925
Oh, stop.
You're not leaving without my friend.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.136
Well, if she doesn't want to go,
we can't force her.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.222
But that's the only way
to get her to do anything!

03:42.305 --> 03:44.182
Two minutes. Give me two minutes.

03:44.266 --> 03:47.686
If I can't talk sense into her,
then I'll carry her here

03:47.769 --> 03:49.813
and strap her into the ambulance myself.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.990
Oh, for Christ's sake.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.620
<i> Hospital security,</i>
<i>you are needed in the main lobby.</i>

04:07.873 --> 04:11.376
We're looking for a Frankie Bergstein.
She arrived by ambulance.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.712
-Hey, Bonnie.
-Hi.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.672
-Philip
-Allison.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.924
Darshon, you were right,
Creed was awesome.

04:18.008 --> 04:19.426
-Told you.
-You're so right.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.303
What is this, her home away from home?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.512
So?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.514
You know that sushi restaurant
you go to all the time?

04:24.598 --> 04:27.434
Everybody knows you and treats you
like you're special? Same thing.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.228
Yeah, totally not even close
to the same thing.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.815
No one by that name has been admitted
through the emergency room.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.860
Oh, she may be using one of her aliases.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.738
Is a "Ms. Eleanor Roosevelt" here?

04:39.821 --> 04:42.365
It wouldn't be that. That's the name
she uses for dinner reservations.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.327
Oh, right. Right, right, right.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.287
Oh, wow.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.916
I'm feeling a little light-headed.
I think I'm gonna just go sit down.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.086
Stop it. She's fine.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.005
Oh, she looks great.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.177
I know. Gloria Swanson.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.348
<i>I am beautiful. I am confident.</i>

05:06.431 --> 05:07.432
Off, off. Be quiet.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.268
<i>I am the perfect age.</i>
<i>I am the perfect size.</i>

05:11.937 --> 05:13.772
<i>-I am good enough.</i>
-Be quick, Mallory.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.733
I'm driving Frankie's car
and don't have hands free.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.443
We're all here at the hospital.
Where are you?

05:18.527 --> 05:21.822
Oh, shoot! I'm sorry, sweetheart.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.783
Frankie insisted she was fine
and refused to go.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.578
<i>I am healthy and my mind is tranquil.</i>

05:28.662 --> 05:30.372
What? What did she say?

05:30.455 --> 05:31.915
Frankie, it's Sol.

05:31.998 --> 05:36.294
That's not her. It's her goddamn
self-affirmation recording.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.964
Ah. Not the first time
I was fooled by that.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.591
She said she was going home.
Can you all meet me there?

05:42.259 --> 05:44.135
Yeah. Dad, why don't you
go back to the theater?

05:44.219 --> 05:46.179
We'll let you know what's going on.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.391
The rest of us will head over
as soon as Allison is done being Allison.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.393
Great. Okay. Hanging up.

05:51.476 --> 05:56.481
<i> Embrace love, light,</i>
<i>and the possibility of a better tomorrow.</i>

05:56.898 --> 05:57.983
Pass.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.323
Frankie?

06:08.159 --> 06:10.620
-Frankie, are you here?
-No!

06:10.704 --> 06:12.455
Shit.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.046
What the hell are you doing?

06:20.130 --> 06:22.799
I'm getting serious about my health.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.427
Why are you acting like nothing happened?

06:25.510 --> 06:27.596
I think you had a stroke, Frankie.

06:27.679 --> 06:28.930
Get outta here.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.515
Then what was it?

06:30.599 --> 06:32.809
Sometimes when you go on
and on and on,

06:32.892 --> 06:35.812
I have the ability
to shut my entire body down.

06:35.895 --> 06:39.399
Maybe I shut down too hard,
like those fainting goats.

06:39.482 --> 06:45.113
I know what I saw and I know
that you have to get this checked out.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.284
See this? Total shut down.
Didn't hear any of that.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.202
Frankie, you here?

06:51.286 --> 06:56.207
Oh! Yes! But don't tell Grace.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.877
Maybe you can talk some sense into her.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.295
How you feeling?

07:01.421 --> 07:02.922
Better now.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.425
Let's get dinner. Ruby's?

07:05.508 --> 07:07.969
I could really go for a mozzarella stick.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.971
She needs to go to the hospital.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.264
For a panic attack?

07:11.348 --> 07:13.058
That's what she told you?

07:13.141 --> 07:16.311
The EMT said it could have been
a neurological event.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.437
What?

07:17.520 --> 07:20.357
I have neurological events all the time.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.069
They're called acid flashbacks
and they're the shit!

07:24.152 --> 07:26.529
She looked really confused and out of it.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.949
Hello? Have you met me? That's my look!

07:29.032 --> 07:32.452
Boom. Frankie burn. Hashtag roasted.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.622
Sounds like this isn't something
you mess around with.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.748
Oh, my God.

07:36.831 --> 07:40.585
Would you Complaining Cathys
be happy if I made you a deal?

07:40.669 --> 07:44.089
I will not go to the hospital,
but I will call my doctor.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.133
And if he tells you
to go to the hospital, will you?

07:47.926 --> 07:50.470
-Yes.
-Deal. Call him. Now.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.429
Okay.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.147
Kidding. Give me your phone.

08:06.903 --> 08:07.737
Peter.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.240
Robert, you are on fire!

08:10.323 --> 08:12.033
-You are John Adams.
-Thank you.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.202
Look, do you know where my family is?

08:14.285 --> 08:17.747
Okay. There is a slight situation,
but everything's fine now.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.376
Sol's on his way back and he'll tell you
all about it after the show.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.586
What kind of situation?
With those protestors?

08:23.670 --> 08:27.716
The buzz backstage is that Sol's ex
was taken to the hospital by ambulance.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.801
Frankie? Oh, my God. What happened?

08:29.884 --> 08:33.096
They don't know. But if you feel
compelled to go, which any person would,

08:33.179 --> 08:35.932
we would all completely understand.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.060
I know all your lines,
and your wig fits me... perfect.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.895
-You've been trying it on?
-It's my job to.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.898
- It is absolutely not, Steve.
- Places please.

08:43.982 --> 08:48.737
I've been texting with Sol and he says,
"Robert, be brave. The show must go on.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.739
And it wouldn't hurt
if you paced it up a little."

08:50.822 --> 08:53.783
-He said that last part?
-Damn it, Robert! There's no time!

08:53.867 --> 08:57.954
"Frankie's home now and seems fine.
No need for Robert to worry."

08:58.038 --> 09:02.250
You know, the only thing that gives me
pause is the use of the word "seems."

09:03.501 --> 09:04.627
I've got this.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.921
Shut the fuck up, Steve.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.590
And sit the fuck down.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.595
Oh, thank God you're here, Dr...?

09:13.678 --> 09:14.763
Oh, just call me Mark.

09:14.846 --> 09:18.600
Mark. I must say, I'm impressed
anybody makes house calls these days.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.811
Well, if someone needs me,
I will go anywhere.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.397
I like to think of my patients
as my children.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.941
Well, your daughter's being a real pill.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.903
Oh, that feels so good.

09:29.986 --> 09:30.987
Frankie?

09:31.488 --> 09:32.614
Hey, Mark!

09:32.697 --> 09:36.117
I'm sorry to get you out here this late
for a brain glitch.

09:36.201 --> 09:39.287
Don't worry about it.
I'll just do a quick examination.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.622
Let's have a look at that tongue.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.834
It's a little coated. Flaming Hot Funyuns?

09:44.918 --> 09:47.504
Right on the money, as per.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.799
Do you want us to clear out?
Give you some privacy?

09:50.882 --> 09:52.759
Well, if you could back up just a bit.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.763
I need to have a clear energy path
to bring in the shamanic spirits.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.389
Oh, God...

10:07.232 --> 10:09.025
Allison knows we're waiting, right?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.319
Yeah. She just has to check out.
She'll be here in a minute.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.530
Are we gonna have to hear
about everything wrong with her?

10:13.613 --> 10:16.157
We don't have time for
the "Ailments with Allison" show.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.242
She fainted.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.619
Because she always has to be
the center of attention,

10:19.702 --> 10:21.955
so she conjures up some kind of illness.

10:22.038 --> 10:25.542
Bud, there's a name for it:
Fictitious Disorder.

10:25.625 --> 10:29.003
First of all, it's "Factitious Disorder"
and she doesn't have that. We checked.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.256
-With a Factitian?
-That's not a thing.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.049
Neither are her numerous diseases.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.468
Shut up, okay? Oh, here she comes.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.056
Hey, honey. What did the doctor say?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.432
Nothing.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.101
It's nothing. It's fine.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.563
Just...

10:48.523 --> 10:52.819
Your chi is lower than I'd like it to be,
but these crystals should help.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.573
I'd also like to do some Reiki.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.449
Oh, that would be great.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.703
You know what else would be great?
Getting a freaking MRI.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.706
Wow, you seem really angry.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.083
-May I see your tongue?
-You may not.

11:07.167 --> 11:11.004
You know, I don't think this
is helping Frankie.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.215
Well, I don't think this is a real thing.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.425
Don't listen to her.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.136
There's some tea I'd like you
to take three times a day.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.429
Hmm.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.974
You know what?
If you could brew it, it would be great.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.559
Tea?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.686
-Tea.
-Tea.

11:28.897 --> 11:32.525
Marshmallow root, dandelion leaf,
reishi mushroom, wild lettuce,

11:32.609 --> 11:35.153
and a little something
I like to call "Mark Bark."

11:35.236 --> 11:38.114
Well, let me get my wizard staff
and pointed hat.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.198
That is a different tea.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.743
Come on, Grace. Who's the doctor here?

11:41.826 --> 11:43.077
Nobody!

11:43.161 --> 11:45.330
Nobody's the doctor here!

11:50.501 --> 11:52.212
Wow.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.631
That's like nothing
I've ever smelled before

11:54.714 --> 11:56.299
and I work with fertilizer.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.134
This is ridiculous.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.261
Look, I know this isn't your thing,

12:00.345 --> 12:03.431
and it might not even be my thing,
but it is her thing.

12:03.514 --> 12:07.226
Well, her thing is also holding her breath
every time a plane flies overhead.

12:07.310 --> 12:11.105
Say what you want, but a plane's never
emptied its toilets over your house.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.274
That's why she does that?

12:13.358 --> 12:14.525
Yeah.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.487
Hey guys,
be sure to keep the tea covered!

12:17.570 --> 12:20.239
There's a lot of
star-constellation energy in there!

12:20.907 --> 12:24.202
Makes total fucking sense! Thanks, Mark!

12:30.875 --> 12:32.085
Here it is.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.295
Oh, great. Thanks, you guys.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.047
Now, remember...

12:36.130 --> 12:40.176
you are a student of the leaf
and the tea is your plant teacher.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.470
Just drink mindfully.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.931
And try not to throw it up
because it tastes like horse shit.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.059
You might want to hold your nose.
The smell alone could kill you.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.104
Hmm.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.064
It's not bad.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.317
It doesn't really have any taste at all.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.653
Let me make sure you made it right.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.030
Oh.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.574
No, that's right.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.169
-Anything?
-Nothing!

13:15.253 --> 13:16.963
Why can't I taste anything?

13:17.046 --> 13:19.716
I don't know, but you should probably
get to the hospital.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.467
-No!
-Oh!

13:21.551 --> 13:22.844
Frankie, we had a deal.

13:22.927 --> 13:26.848
Yes, but I didn't think this would happen!

13:26.931 --> 13:29.308
<i>Satellite pharmacy, pick up 2346.</i>

13:29.392 --> 13:32.061
Are you kidding me?
You're at the hospital now?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.188
We're waiting to talk to the doctor.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.733
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.693
Hang on, your mom wants to talk to you.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.112
Hi, sweetheart.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.156
Hey, Mom. We're coming to the hospital.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.575
Oh, no. Stay there. We'll be home soon.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.286
Are you sure? We really want to see you.

13:48.369 --> 13:52.206
Well, it was just some routine tests.
Peed in a cup... blah, blah, blah.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.291
You know the drill.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.543
Yes, I do.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.297
All right, well, we'll be waiting for you
when you get here. Okay?

14:00.298 --> 14:02.258
-Love you.
-Love you too.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.638
Good God! Fishing rights!

14:07.722 --> 14:10.141
How long are these piddlings to go on?

14:10.725 --> 14:12.268
Yeah? How long?

14:12.351 --> 14:15.063
-How long is all this going to go on?
-Sit down, jerk!

14:15.146 --> 14:17.774
-Hey. Get your hands off me.
-Animals, get out!

14:17.857 --> 14:19.400
I bought a ticket!

14:26.741 --> 14:27.950
Well...

14:30.620 --> 14:31.621
We are...

14:31.704 --> 14:34.874
I think what Mr. Adams
is trying to say is,

14:34.957 --> 14:37.418
he has been sitting here
for three full days.

14:38.252 --> 14:42.006
We have endured by my count
85 separate changes--

14:42.090 --> 14:43.383
Be gone, you drunk!

14:44.550 --> 14:47.845
And though my colleague
is afflicted by the drink,

14:47.929 --> 14:50.765
he doth uttereth the truth.

14:52.934 --> 14:57.980
For we have indeed witnessed 85 changes.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.733
The nurse said the doctor is on his way.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.985
Stop worrying.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.737
Whatever it is, it's going to be okay.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.074
Well, just keep talking.
Your voice calms me down.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.787
I've heard great things
about this hospital.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.665
You're in good hands.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.543
Why don't we just be quiet
for a little while?

15:21.796 --> 15:22.839
Okay--

15:22.922 --> 15:24.382
Sounds good to me. Can I go now?

15:24.465 --> 15:28.261
-Don't you want to know what's going on?
-No, not really.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.596
Well, you pulled me out
of an Ed Sheeran concert,

15:30.680 --> 15:32.598
so I feel like I kind of owe you.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.143
All right. Knock yourself out.

15:35.226 --> 15:38.938
Well, it looks like you had a TIA,
which is essentially a mini-stroke.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.441
Oh, my God. I had a feeling.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.650
What does that mean?

15:42.733 --> 15:46.237
Well, the TIA doesn't do
any visible damage to the brain tissue,

15:46.320 --> 15:49.115
but something else
did show up on your scan.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.826
You see this spot there?

15:51.909 --> 15:54.495
Is that the button
I snorted up my nose when I was four?

15:54.579 --> 15:57.123
No. It's an old lesion.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.459
And while we can't pinpoint it exactly,

15:59.542 --> 16:04.172
it does indicate that you had a fairly
significant stroke about ten years ago.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.721
No, no, that can't be right.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.056
How is that possible?

16:14.140 --> 16:15.933
Well, it's actually fairly common.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.227
The symptoms could have been
easily overlooked:

16:18.311 --> 16:21.814
some weakness, dizziness,
it could even happen in your sleep.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.483
But what does that mean?

16:23.566 --> 16:25.776
You're a candidate for another stroke.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.488
Oh, God.

16:29.864 --> 16:30.907
What does she do now?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.826
Well, I'm going to put her on
some blood thinners and some statins,

16:33.910 --> 16:36.120
and before you leave,
I'm gonna give you information

16:36.204 --> 16:41.000
about Transient Ischemic Attacks
and some recommended lifestyle changes.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.544
Exercise, nutrition, that kind of thing.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.837
Any questions?

16:44.921 --> 16:46.464
No.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.299
Thank you so much, Dr. Weintraub.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.009
-Appreciate it.
-No problem.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.427
Thank you.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.100
This is a good thing.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.144
Now we can be on top of it, right?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.814
I want to go home.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.786
-Hey, Mom, how are you?
-How's it going?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.538
- What happened?
- Hey, guys.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.207
Oh, that's a good blood pressure cuff.
It's the new one.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.042
So psyched.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.462
Uh, what exactly did the doctor say?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.508
Well...
He said that, um...

17:30.591 --> 17:32.593
that I had a stroke.

17:32.677 --> 17:33.553
A mini-stroke.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.430
There was no damage to brain tissue,
which is good.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.974
-Grace--
-But...

17:38.057 --> 17:39.934
-But what?
-Mom?

17:40.518 --> 17:45.064
Apparently, I had
a more significant stroke, he thinks,

17:45.147 --> 17:46.941
around ten years ago.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.234
-Wow.
-Oh, my God.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.360
And you didn't know?

17:49.443 --> 17:50.945
No. I had no idea.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.447
Wait. There was that time
we went to see<i> Superbad</i>

17:53.531 --> 17:55.366
and you started spouting gibberish
at Jonah Hill.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.451
No, no, that wasn't a stroke.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.246
They hadn't perfected edibles back then.

18:00.329 --> 18:04.375
Wait. About ten years ago?
That's when we all went to Napa.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.586
-Oh, yeah.
-What about it?

18:06.669 --> 18:09.255
You got lost for half a day in a vineyard.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.383
I didn't get lost.
I was hiding in a vineyard.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.635
-From what?
-Grapes.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.848
And they hadn't perfected edibles yet.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.183
All of this is gonna change.

18:21.267 --> 18:25.313
As the doctor said, we have
some major lifestyle changes to make.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.939
And I'm gonna help you.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.859
First thing tomorrow,
we're going to get you a nutritionist,

18:29.942 --> 18:31.652
gonna start an exercise program.

18:31.736 --> 18:32.778
Good God!

18:32.862 --> 18:36.824
Why don't you go get your gun and shoot me
in the face like you wanted to all along.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.286
You know what? I'm going to cancel
my trip to Santa Fe this week.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.831
No. I don't want anybody
cancelling anything for me.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.541
I don't want to be away from you.

18:46.584 --> 18:49.670
Maybe I should go with you.
The desert could do me some good.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.798
Right now?
What, are you fresh out of cow skulls?

18:52.882 --> 18:55.676
Yes. As a matter of fact I am.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.511
All right, you know what, kids?

18:57.595 --> 18:59.972
It's been a long day
and your mom needs rest.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.474
So...

19:01.557 --> 19:03.017
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.477
Bye, sweetheart.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.897
Oh, man. Did anybody text Dad?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.899
How about a "Golda Meir"?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.901
Really?

19:11.984 --> 19:14.528
<i>Dr. Katz, to Labor and Delivery...</i>

19:20.576 --> 19:22.828
-Weird night, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.084
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, why?

19:29.085 --> 19:32.672
I don't know, when you came out
of the hospital and said you were fine

19:32.755 --> 19:35.257
something didn't feel right about that.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.010
Oh, God, you know me so well.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.512
Should I be worried?

19:40.346 --> 19:43.015
-What did the doctor say? Is it serious?
-No.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.226
A bunch of stuff. And yes.

19:45.309 --> 19:49.980
Allison, tell me. I'm here, okay?

19:53.275 --> 19:55.152
I'm pregnant.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.240
Are you still here?

19:59.323 --> 20:02.368
Yes. Of course. Of course.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.162
Are you sure?

20:05.246 --> 20:08.624
Well, my blood has lied to me before,
but the doctor seemed pretty sure.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.086
Well, I mean...

20:13.254 --> 20:15.381
-This is very...
-Surprising.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.007
Surprising. Yes.

20:17.091 --> 20:20.428
But it's also... challenging?

20:20.511 --> 20:22.263
Very, very challenging.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.640
But also...

20:24.724 --> 20:26.976
-Information that is...
-Private.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.979
Yes. But also--

20:30.062 --> 20:31.939
For fuck's sake, Bud,
just tell me what you think.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.693
I think...

20:40.823 --> 20:41.824
Me, too.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.922
You ruined my opening night.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.758
I'm sorry.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.342
Frankie got sick and I--

21:00.426 --> 21:04.346
I'm not talking about you walking out
on my show twice.

21:04.430 --> 21:09.393
And while that was extremely annoying,
I'm talking about that wretched heckler.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.229
-Oh, that was unbelievable.
-Yes!

21:12.313 --> 21:16.358
I guess something must have gotten him
really revved up.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.612
I... Robert--

21:19.695 --> 21:21.655
I know it was you, Sol.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.908
You threw the Pepsi at that kid,
didn't you?

21:23.991 --> 21:26.577
It was a Mr. Bubbly
and it was an accident.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.331
Well, you accidentally
accelerated that situation.

21:30.915 --> 21:33.918
If you had just let them be,
like I asked you to,

21:34.001 --> 21:35.586
no one would have paid any attention

21:35.669 --> 21:38.964
and they would have just crawled back
under the rock they came from.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.257
But if I hadn't said anything--

21:40.341 --> 21:43.052
We'd be celebrating over drinks
at the cast party.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.512
What was I supposed to do?

21:44.595 --> 21:46.972
Let. It. Go.

21:47.056 --> 21:49.266
No! I can't.

21:49.350 --> 21:53.771
"The only thing necessary for the triumph
of evil is for good men to do nothing."

21:53.854 --> 21:57.858
My father had that quote framed
and hung in our living room.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.652
I saw it every day.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.698
I'm not going to let this go, Robert.

22:04.782 --> 22:09.829
Especially... Especially after what
they did to you today.

22:11.705 --> 22:17.670
Those people...
fucked with the wrong bored old man!

22:19.505 --> 22:24.260
Now, go in there
and wash that makeup off your face.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.604
I planted these crab apple trees
when I bought the place.

22:35.688 --> 22:39.024
There's a family of mule deer
who come by every evening.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.902
There's a mother, and father,
two little ones.

22:41.986 --> 22:45.197
They've just about picked this tree clean.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.032
Oh, it sounds so beautiful.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.787
Yeah, they do get gassy.

22:51.870 --> 22:52.955
Knock-knock.

22:53.038 --> 22:56.458
You left your reading glasses downstairs.
I thought you might need them.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.751
Thank you.

22:57.835 --> 23:01.422
And, um, you left these downstairs, too.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.258
Since you have your glasses,
maybe you want to take a look.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.302
If it's all right with you,
I'll read them later.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.389
-Have you taken your blood pressure yet?
-No.

23:10.472 --> 23:13.726
-Would you like me to show you how--
-No. I would not.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.479
Okay.

23:19.440 --> 23:23.444
Oh, by the way, if you're still
thinking about going to Santa Fe,

23:23.527 --> 23:26.488
it is really not a good idea
to fly right now.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.992
We're thinking maybe we'd drive.
Make it a nice road trip.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.744
Yeah, I asked about that, too.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.371
She's not supposed to sit
for long stretches.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.374
You know, she has to get up
and walk around every half hour.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.293
For circulation.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.753
Who did you ask?

23:41.712 --> 23:42.838
Dr. Weintraub.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.840
-You called him?
-Yes!

23:44.923 --> 23:47.426
To find out if it was all right
for you to travel so soon.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.219
You called my doctor?

23:49.303 --> 23:50.971
Frankie. It's okay.

23:51.055 --> 23:53.182
No, it's not okay.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.392
You don't get to call my doctor.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.102
You're not my mother.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.146
You're not my husband.

23:59.229 --> 24:03.192
From now on, if I have any questions,
I'll call him.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.360
Oh, will you?

24:04.443 --> 24:07.154
Because you were going to take a trip
without ever talking to him.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.991
Where are you going? Don't leave.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.786
I'm not leaving.

24:13.869 --> 24:17.581
I just think you two need for me
not to be here.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.379
Why are you angry with me?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.881
Would you prefer if I gave you a kiss
and said thank you?

24:25.964 --> 24:28.926
Yes! I was right!

24:29.009 --> 24:32.221
There is something serious
that you needed to know about

24:32.304 --> 24:33.639
so you could take care of it.

24:34.390 --> 24:37.309
This is not what I want my life
to look like!

24:37.393 --> 24:40.646
So you have to take a few pills
and check your blood pressure.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.106
That's not your life.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.816
I take pills.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.777
My God, this is America,
everybody takes pills.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.654
It's not just the pills.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.699
I was much happier not knowing.

24:51.782 --> 24:56.078
Now I'm going to wake up every morning
thinking about spots on my brain.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.956
Every time I stumble over a word
I'm going to think,

24:59.039 --> 25:00.874
"It's happening again!"

25:00.958 --> 25:05.295
Or wonder "Will I even get
to finish my sentence?"

25:05.963 --> 25:08.006
It scares the shit out of me.

25:08.090 --> 25:11.635
Oh, you want to talk about scared?
Let's talk about it.

25:12.261 --> 25:13.679
Today, in the car?

25:13.762 --> 25:17.641
I thought I was watching you die
right in front of me.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.853
I was terrified that
I was losing my best friend.

25:20.936 --> 25:24.106
I did what I was supposed to do
for somebody that I care about.

25:25.023 --> 25:29.153
I did the right thing
and I am not gonna apologize for it.

25:37.202 --> 25:40.414
Would you please tell Jacob to come in
on your way out?

26:49.733 --> 26:51.193
<i>Okay, good night.</i>
