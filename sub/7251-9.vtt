"Twenty-three is old. It's almost twenty-five, which is, like, almost mid-twenties."

00:27.934 --> 00:29.653
- She did not say that.
- She did say that.

00:29.729 --> 00:33.545
It seems a little wrong that Jessica Simpson is alive and well and Roy got eaten by his tiger.

00:33.627 --> 00:35.439
Survival of the fittest, baby.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.783
Oh, man, this place is packed.

00:38.526 --> 00:41.982
- Damn that Zagat guide.
- Only the loser mini-table is open.

00:42.111 --> 00:44.011
- What do we do?
- Time to hover.

00:44.180 --> 00:47.936
- You take the old couple, I'll hit the cybergeek.
- Got it.

00:51.087 --> 00:52.014
Hello.

00:54.404 --> 00:55.286
Hello.

01:01.267 --> 01:03.835
That was some of the best hovering I've ever seen you do.

01:03.922 --> 01:07.343
- I was taught by the best.
- But the focus - you never blinked.

01:07.429 --> 01:12.374
- And the sneeze - so tiny, so dainty, so terrifying to the old.
- Luke's gonna be mad.

01:12.423 --> 01:15.912
- I mean, he hates it when we commandeer two tables during rush hour.
- Oh, he only hated it that one time.

01:16.019 --> 01:19.140
- What time?
- The time when we did it and he was mad.

01:19.221 --> 01:20.941
- He's hated it every time we've done it.
- No.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.232
- Yes.
- No, only the one time.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.742
- Which time?
- The time we did it and he was mad.

01:23.818 --> 01:27.018
- You're gonna do this to Luke, aren't you?
- 'Til he's so dizzy he throws up.

01:27.184 --> 01:29.578
- Nice. Calendars?
- Let's do it.

01:30.076 --> 01:34.504
- Okay, so your finals-induced hibernation period is setting in...
- Monday.

01:34.583 --> 01:38.749
Okay. So how about... Sunday we have a major Sephora fix,

01:38.810 --> 01:42.962
- maybe a movie, sort of a see-ya day before you go bye-bye?
- Throw in a pedicure and you got a deal.

01:43.034 --> 01:46.367
- Done.
- Coffee's gonna be ready in a sec. You know what you want?

01:46.424 --> 01:50.704
Oh, well, we need napkins to cover this big, wide, expansive table.

01:50.755 --> 01:53.090
Okay. Hey, are you in the mood for pancakes?

01:53.172 --> 01:56.690
Pancakes, sure, yeah. I guess we have enough space for pancakes.

01:56.756 --> 02:02.091
'Cause I'm making pumpkin pancakes and it comes with homemade cinnamon butter.

02:02.168 --> 02:03.929
- You made cinnamon butter?
- This morning.

02:04.016 --> 02:06.817
Wow. I bet the other people who would love a table right now but can't have one

02:06.889 --> 02:09.832
'cause they're all taken would love pumpkin pancakes with homemade cinnamon butter.

02:09.936 --> 02:11.512
- I'll get your coffee.
- Hey, hold on.

02:11.594 --> 02:13.371
- What?
- We're sitting at two tables.

02:13.468 --> 02:15.434
- Yeah?
- You hate that. That makes you mad.

02:15.518 --> 02:18.306
- Only the one time.
- Why are you so sunny this morning?

02:18.440 --> 02:22.510
- Well, actually, I finally hired some help.
- Oh, good for you.

02:22.597 --> 02:26.483
Yeah, I figured I needed the help. What the hell, get a kid in here to pick up the slack, ya know?

02:26.596 --> 02:29.888
- I kind of feel like a weight's been lifted, ya know?
- Sounds very sensible.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.173
Let me get your food going.

02:32.662 --> 02:34.521
- Okay, so, talk to me.
- Talk to you about what?

02:34.595 --> 02:36.989
- Talk to me about Jason.
- There's nothing to talk about.

02:37.097 --> 02:42.734
Oh, come on. I'm in a serious romantic dry spell. I need to live vicariously through somebody.

02:42.852 --> 02:44.818
- He has called.
- Okay.

02:44.910 --> 02:47.977
- He has sent things.
- Pipe bombs?

02:48.076 --> 02:49.651
- Flowers, candy.
- Even better.

02:49.892 --> 02:52.421
But I don't know, he's my father's partner, I've known him forever.

02:52.488 --> 02:55.831
I mean, can you imagine if I actually went out with someone from my 'hood?

02:55.913 --> 02:59.507
- Do you like him?
- Well, he's completely not my type, but...

02:59.604 --> 03:03.736
he does have a thing and the smarts and he does keep up.

03:03.834 --> 03:07.865
- Maybe you should just go out with him and see what happens.
- No. Dad would flip and Mom hates him,

03:07.966 --> 03:12.062
so she would see it as some sort of personal attack and I'm just getting her off me for spilling wine on the carpet.

03:12.114 --> 03:13.527
- When did you do that?
- Ninth grade.

03:13.792 --> 03:16.492
Things are quiet now. I just wanna keep them quiet.

03:16.994 --> 03:19.246
Hey, Brennon, pick up.

03:20.644 --> 03:22.047
- Oh, my God.
- What?

03:22.844 --> 03:26.189
- He hired Brennon Lewis.
- You know him?

03:26.286 --> 03:27.960
- I went to junior high with him.
- And?

03:28.368 --> 03:32.301
- He doesn't look that bad.
- He's the boy who dissected a frog,

03:32.402 --> 03:37.542
- did not wash his hands, and then ate a sandwich.
- He's like the lost Farrelly brother. He's so stupid.

03:37.639 --> 03:41.929
He watched "The Breakfast Club" and decided to tape his own butt cheeks together.

03:42.029 --> 03:46.449
Okay, so Mensa's not sending him a t-shirt yet, but Luke has hired him so we have to give him a chance.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.131
- You have the pancakes?
- We sure do.

03:49.910 --> 03:52.521
- Hi, Brennon.
- Hey.

03:52.875 --> 03:56.607
- Rory Gilmore. We went to school together.
- Yeah?

03:56.781 --> 04:00.054
You don't remember. Biology - the frog?

04:00.510 --> 04:02.169
There have been a lot of frogs, man.

04:03.372 --> 04:05.620
Okay. Thanks for the food.

04:09.464 --> 04:11.513
Your kids will be gorgeous.

04:06.815 --> 05:09.529
This roommate of mine in sophomore year - we absolutely hated him.

05:09.779 --> 05:14.479
He was, in addition to being a complete nincompoop, rather a chubby lad.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.728
So one night, we tied him in between two mattresses and threw him out the window.

05:18.816 --> 05:20.542
- What?
- I'm writing that one down.

05:20.798 --> 05:23.542
- Was he okay?
- Oh, he was fine. He went to sleep.

05:23.706 --> 05:27.576
- He woke up in the morning and picked up right where he left off.
- Man.

05:27.669 --> 05:31.236
We wound up throwing him out the window every night for a month, and then he transferred.

05:31.314 --> 05:34.002
Well, do you think you guys tossing him out the window on a regular basis

05:34.074 --> 05:37.915
- had something to do with that decision?
- Well, it crossed our minds, yes.

05:38.031 --> 05:42.030
However, we were young and full of energy. Every day was an adventure.

05:42.123 --> 05:44.642
No challenge was too great. We wanted to change the world.

05:44.785 --> 05:48.123
This is so great. Richard, I want to thank you for inviting me to lunch.

05:48.225 --> 05:49.711
Well, you're very welcome, Paris.

05:49.935 --> 05:54.794
How often does a man like me get the chance to entertain two such lovely and intelligent young ladies?

05:54.882 --> 05:59.007
- You are a honey-tongued devil, aren't you, Dick?
- So, tell me, what are your plans for the game?

05:59.122 --> 06:01.866
- The what?
- The game. The Harvard-Yale game.

06:01.967 --> 06:04.824
- I'm going. I already have my ticket. I bought it a month ago.
- You did?

06:04.896 --> 06:10.267
It's the game, Rory. It's a memory - a college memory, and I intend on having as many college memories as possible.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.719
Your grandmother and I have attended every one of these games for the past 32 years.

06:13.800 --> 06:18.879
We always buy a block of seats, and we got one for you. So how about it? We'd love to take you.

06:18.966 --> 06:21.874
- And I would love to go.
- Good. It'll be a wonderful day.

06:21.962 --> 06:24.029
- It will be a day to remember.
- Richard?

06:24.332 --> 06:26.882
Asher! Oh, look at you!

06:27.978 --> 06:29.744
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

06:29.861 --> 06:32.774
Your grandfather knows Asher Fleming? That's amazing.

06:32.867 --> 06:37.301
I read his latest book four times. He was on Charlie Rose last week and he almost kept me awake.

06:37.392 --> 06:40.711
- Well, I didn't know he knew him.
- I wonder if I can get an interview with him for the paper.

06:40.789 --> 06:42.959
- What if I want an interview with him for the paper?
- What?

06:43.030 --> 06:45.172
- Well, he's my grandfather.
- You're stealing my interview.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.542
- No, I'm just making you crazy.
- Like that's hard. Feel proud.

06:47.633 --> 06:51.549
Girls, I'd like to introduce you to a former classmate of mine - Asher Fleming.

06:51.867 --> 06:54.296
- Asher, this is my granddaughter, Rory.
- Hello.

06:54.371 --> 06:56.717
- A pleasure to meet you.
- And her friend, Paris Geller.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.128
- Paris.
- I saw you on Charlie Rose. You were good.

06:59.230 --> 07:01.591
- Thank you.
- Not too self-important, you made your point,

07:01.678 --> 07:05.415
and managed to look remotely interested when Charlie babbled on pretentiously about nothing.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.005
Well, Charlie Rose is a good friend of mine.

07:07.108 --> 07:10.525
Whatever. Listen, professor, I'd love to do a profile on you for the paper.

07:10.592 --> 07:15.435
Nothing puffy. Straight-up, hard-hitting, uncensored. Your views, no slant. Tomorrow work for you?

07:15.558 --> 07:20.201
Well, I'll have to check my schedule. I do teach, you know.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.147
Sure, you gotta pay the bills.

07:23.351 --> 07:27.775
Richard, terrific to see you again. Let's have lunch next week.

07:27.872 --> 07:29.366
- Consider it a date.
- Splendid.

07:29.443 --> 07:31.123
- Right.
- Goodbye, ladies.

07:33.679 --> 07:34.656
I'm a fan!

07:37.353 --> 07:40.860
- I could've opened with that, couldn't I have?
- Then you wouldn't be you.

07:48.040 --> 07:51.904
Okay, see, a better man, a smarter man, a different man, would take into account the fact that

07:52.002 --> 07:55.920
flowers, candy, and numerous phone calls have gone completely unnoticed by you.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.559
Those men would get a clue, have some pride, grow a pair, and move on.

07:59.754 --> 08:04.993
Oh, well. Lorelai Gilmore, daughter of Richard and Emily, mother of Rory, and friend to all,

08:05.068 --> 08:08.642
would you join me for dinner on Saturday night? Please call me back

08:08.719 --> 08:12.437
because I will someday find my pathetic threshold and stop trying.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.737
- This is Jason.
- This is Lorelai.

08:20.009 --> 08:21.525
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

08:21.632 --> 08:24.080
- You're really calling me back?
- Yes, I am.

08:24.511 --> 08:28.066
Is there someone there who could document this - a photographer or a really fast painter?

08:28.166 --> 08:30.920
See, you get the girl to call you back and then you give her a hard time.

08:31.008 --> 08:35.313
- You're right, I apologize. So, how are you?
- I'm fine, and you?

08:35.405 --> 08:39.844
I don't know. I've got a slight suspicion you've called to tell me you're not available for dinner on Saturday night,

08:39.910 --> 08:42.727
- and that's gonna bum me out.
- Look, Jason...

08:42.808 --> 08:46.397
Okay, before you continue, just let me say that I got us reservations at the China Garden.

08:46.546 --> 08:51.467
- Ah, you're kidding.
- Very hot ticket in town. Good food, great bar, quite a scene.

08:51.558 --> 08:54.262
- How did you do that?
- Pulled a few strings, greased a few palms,

08:54.349 --> 08:58.722
- sold myself to a sous-chef - a very tender man, I might add.
- I just want you to be happy.

08:58.829 --> 09:02.771
So, long story short - table for two at 8:30. You need a little black dress.

09:02.853 --> 09:05.245
- I am so incredibly tempted.
- But?

09:05.327 --> 09:10.964
But you work with my father. You're hated by my mother. You come from my world.

09:11.046 --> 09:14.732
- You find me repulsive.
- No, I don't, and I wish I did.

09:14.820 --> 09:19.683
Okay, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna keep the reservation and go by myself.

09:19.776 --> 09:23.236
I've been reading about this place for months, and personally, I would like to see what all the fuss is about.

09:23.313 --> 09:27.829
- Do you understand at all where I'm coming from?
- Nope, but that's okay.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.991
- Well, I'm sorry, Jason.
- Me, too.

09:30.225 --> 09:33.180
- I bet you look good in one of those little black dresses.
- Well, yes, I do.

09:33.726 --> 09:35.515
- Goodbye, Lorelai.
- Bye, Jason.

09:37.527 --> 09:40.757
It's ten o'clock at night and suddenly I hear this terrible racket.

09:40.854 --> 09:47.383
So I go outside and there is May Richmond sneaking a 6-foot Rudolph into her garage.

09:47.491 --> 09:50.557
- That woman is working my last nerve. 
- So what?

09:50.701 --> 09:53.974
- So what? Don't you know what this means? 
- I'm racking my brain.

09:54.058 --> 09:58.662
- They're going to put a giant plastic reindeer on their roof. 
- Which is right next to our roof.

09:58.744 --> 10:01.590
So, what, are you scared they'll keep you up all night playing reindeer games?

10:01.663 --> 10:06.993
They can't light them up. The homeowners association has very strict rules about the amount of lights

10:07.059 --> 10:10.894
that you can display in front of your house, and they already have those lawn twinklers.

10:10.961 --> 10:14.412
They could give up their lawn twinklers and focus solely on the reindeer.

10:14.469 --> 10:18.472
I don't know. They were awfully proud of their twinklers last year. It was all they talked about.

10:18.549 --> 10:22.777
Okay, guys - take a step back, examine the conversation you're having, and spend some time apart.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.881
- May I have some more roast, please, Grandma? 
- Of course you may.

10:25.952 --> 10:28.323
- It's really good tonight, Mom.
- Thank you, Lorelai.

10:28.430 --> 10:33.750
Oh, by the way, Rory, we will pick you up in front of your residence hall tomorrow morning, nine o'clock sharp.

10:33.827 --> 10:35.660
- Okay. 
- Tomorrow? What's happening tomorrow?

10:35.758 --> 10:37.994
- Tomorrow's the game. 
- Oh, the game...

10:38.092 --> 10:41.134
- The game. The Harvard-Yale game. 
- Right, right. Football?

10:41.220 --> 10:43.866
- Lorelai. 
- Why does the question "Football?" get a "Lorelai"?

10:43.959 --> 10:48.342
Yes, it's football - the most important football game of the entire year.

10:48.434 --> 10:51.737
- All of Yale will be there. 
- Oh, cool. Can I go?

10:51.870 --> 10:55.244
- You want to go to a football game? 
- Well, if it's such a big deal, absolutely.

10:55.336 --> 10:56.902
But you don't like football. 

10:57.006 --> 11:01.802
Well, no, I'm not the diehard fan that, say, you are, Mom, but it's Rory's school.

11:02.038 --> 11:03.300
You won't get bored? 

11:03.408 --> 11:06.600
Yes, of course I'll get bored, but that's when the "South Park" impressions kick in.

11:06.698 --> 11:10.829
- Lorelai, we have invited friends - important people. 
- I'm kidding, Mom. I can only do Cartman.

11:10.931 --> 11:13.447
- So, you want to go? 
- Yup.

11:13.538 --> 11:16.263
- You're sure about this? 
- Absolutely positive.

11:16.360 --> 11:20.102
- Well, I guess we could uninvite someone. 
- Cecil, perhaps.

11:20.189 --> 11:22.668
- Or Donlon. 
- Donlon just had his colon removed.

11:22.745 --> 11:27.024
Well, Cecil then. I guess I should call him now, give him time to get another ticket.

11:27.383 --> 11:29.946
- I'll call his wife. 
- Thanks.

11:30.825 --> 11:31.741
What is wrong with you? 

11:31.825 --> 11:33.941
What is wrong with you? Why didn't you get me a ticket to the game?

11:34.014 --> 11:36.252
- I was saving you, dummy. 
- Saving me from what?

11:36.358 --> 11:38.135
- You hate football. 
- So do you.

11:38.223 --> 11:41.729
Yeah, I know I hate football, but I couldn't get out of it. You could.

11:41.811 --> 11:45.354
Okay, so I have to go watch a football game. At least I get to hang with you before finals.

11:45.436 --> 11:46.356
- You sure? 
- Of course. 

11:46.436 --> 11:48.852
I mean, what's a football game last? Hour, hour and a half?

11:49.640 --> 11:52.760
Longer than an hour and a half? Are you kidding me?

11:52.947 --> 11:58.764
Damn it. Emily, Cecil's the one who had his colon removed. I'm calling Donlon.

12:04.196 --> 12:07.861
- I hate football. 
- I tried to get you out of it.

12:07.949 --> 12:10.356
- Well, you should have tried harder. 
- Next time.

12:10.469 --> 12:13.821
- Where's Luke? 
- Probably in bed where the rest of the world is on a Saturday.

12:13.966 --> 12:16.152
- Did I put on underwear? 
- What?

12:16.284 --> 12:18.824
I think I forgot to put on underwear. Can you check?

12:21.205 --> 12:23.922
- Did I just ask you to check if I put on underwear? 
- Yes.

12:24.149 --> 12:27.344
- I hate football. 
- You just need coffee.

12:27.493 --> 12:29.074
- Oh, no. 
- What?

12:29.203 --> 12:30.442
- Froggy. 
- Brennon?

12:30.575 --> 12:32.669
- I hate that kid. 
- I thought we were gonna give him a chance.

12:32.756 --> 12:35.649
Yeah, chance ended when he dumped a chili-bean omelet on me the other day.

12:35.716 --> 12:37.297
What do we do? Oh, he's coming over.

12:38.127 --> 12:41.204
- What can I do for you, chicas? 
- Oh, we'd just like to order, please.

12:41.388 --> 12:44.340
- Go ahead. 
- I'll have the cheese omelet, extra cheddar, no Jack,

12:44.431 --> 12:47.224
sourdough toast, two bacons, two sausages... you're not writing this down. 

12:47.331 --> 12:49.224
Don't need to. Continue.

12:49.541 --> 12:54.219
Two bacons, two sausages, one pancake... I would really like you to write this down.

12:54.333 --> 12:58.357
- Trust me, it's all stored. What would you like? 
- Rye toast.

12:58.540 --> 13:01.480
- You want that toasted? 
- Sure, why not?

13:01.699 --> 13:03.640
- Got it. 
- Rye toast?

13:03.784 --> 13:05.324
My odds are way better than yours.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.616
- Brennon! 
- Oh, nice volume.

13:08.817 --> 13:10.906
- This is a box of doughnuts. 
- Yeah?

13:11.044 --> 13:13.060
It's supposed to be a box of bagels.

13:13.650 --> 13:17.464
- What, they both have holes in them, right? 
- We've already had this conversation.

13:17.598 --> 13:20.337
Get me the bagels, get me the bagels! Go. Now. Bye.

13:24.572 --> 13:27.284
- Excuse me, can I get a napkin? 
- Yeah, sure.

13:30.285 --> 13:32.876
Excuse me, can I get a napkin to put my napkin on?

13:34.027 --> 13:37.192
You know, this is so completely unfair. I didn't even know Luke was looking for someone.

13:37.253 --> 13:39.492
- I would love to work here. 
- Your mother would have let you?

13:39.593 --> 13:42.170
I mean, Luke is a man. With man parts, we think.

13:42.281 --> 13:46.828
Luke's is one of the few Mrs. Kim-approved places. No alcohol, walking distance to the church,

13:46.889 --> 13:52.260
and you can see my house from here. I totally need the money, and instead I get to return a box of doughnuts once a day.

13:52.403 --> 13:54.784
- Rye toast. 
- Told ya.

13:56.110 --> 13:58.044
You wanted... something, right?

13:59.790 --> 14:01.964
- Oh, excuse me just a second, won't you? 
- Sure.

14:03.406 --> 14:05.040
- Luke? 
- What are you doing here?

14:05.147 --> 14:08.314
- We're going to the Harvard-Yale game. 
- You're going to the Harvard-Yale game?

14:08.406 --> 14:10.580
- You know what they do at the Harvard-Yale game? 
- They make babies?

14:10.645 --> 14:12.295
- They play football. 
- Yes, I know they pay football.

14:12.382 --> 14:15.443
- And you're supposed to watch them play football. 
- Let's not talk about me anymore.

14:15.510 --> 14:17.466
- Let's talk about you. I'm worried. 
- Why?

14:17.538 --> 14:21.783
Ever since you hired Brennon, the little spark has gone out of your eyes.

14:21.854 --> 14:23.384
- It has? 
- Yes, it has.

14:23.472 --> 14:29.780
And I am here to tell you that it is hell watching you go through this, so I think for your own sake, you should fire Froggy.

14:29.851 --> 14:31.392
- Froggy? 
- Brennon.

14:31.495 --> 14:35.140
- You want me to fire Brennon, why? 
- The spark. Remember the spark?

14:35.207 --> 14:37.818
- Why do you want me to fire Brennon? 
- Come back, little spark, come back.

14:37.895 --> 14:39.754
- Lorelai. 
- He doesn't write the orders down,

14:39.826 --> 14:43.558
he never brings you food that's hot or yours, he can't distinguish bagels from doughnuts,

14:43.630 --> 14:48.285
he hands out butt napkins, and he has worn that Foreigner t-shirt every single day since he started working here

14:48.358 --> 14:51.944
- and he doesn't know who they are. I asked him. 
- What are butt napkins?

14:52.130 --> 14:56.115
Kirk needed a napkin, and he pulled one out of his back pocket.

14:56.614 --> 14:58.698
- Hey, Bren? 
- Yeah, boss?

14:58.800 --> 15:01.570
- Did you give Kirk a napkin out of your back pocket? 
- Yeah.

15:01.641 --> 15:03.315
- Don't. 
- Okay.

15:04.924 --> 15:10.050
- That's it? What about all the other stuff? 
- Look, you're just used to me. Give him time.

15:10.131 --> 15:12.579
Have you heard about the frog, the hands, and the sandwich?

15:12.654 --> 15:16.286
- No, but I heard about the rabbi, the priest, and the duck. 
- You're not taking me seriously.

15:16.361 --> 15:19.622
Hey, Bren, get Ms. Gilmore a cup of hot coffee, will ya?

15:20.422 --> 15:25.337
Give the kid a chance, all right? He's helping me out a great deal - decaf - and I have faith in him.

15:25.410 --> 15:30.212
All he needs is a little more time - black top - to learn the ropes and he'll be fine.

15:32.209 --> 15:35.716
- Where did he go? 
- I don't know.

15:42.744 --> 15:45.213
Where are they all going? It's Saturday morning, they should be in bed.

15:45.331 --> 15:48.971
- They're excited about life. It's a college thing. 
- How come you're not excited about life?

15:49.038 --> 15:50.814
I find nothing exciting before eleven.

15:51.567 --> 15:54.993
- Yoo-hoo, girls, over here! 
- God, who's yoo-hooing?

15:55.955 --> 15:58.069
- Oh, my God. 
- Lorelai, Rory.

15:58.146 --> 16:00.762
- It's a fine day for football. 
- And funny hats.

16:00.835 --> 16:04.585
If you're going to continue sitting on the ground like that, you should get yourself a saxophone and a tip cup.

16:04.662 --> 16:06.691
- Sorry. Up. 
- Right.

16:07.060 --> 16:10.762
- Lorelai, what are you wearing? 
- I'm sorry, you're horrified by what I'm wearing?

16:10.895 --> 16:13.394
- You're wearing crimson. 
- I'm not wearing crimson.

16:13.470 --> 16:15.917
- Oh, she can't go like that. 
- Crimson is Harvard's color.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.826
That's a very dangerous choice to make today, Lorelai.

16:18.939 --> 16:21.992
- I'm not wearing crimson. I'm wearing red. 
- Same thing.

16:22.068 --> 16:25.427
- Very different. 
- Look at Rory. Rory is dressed in Yale colors.

16:25.493 --> 16:27.915
- Why can't you be like Rory? 
- Rory looks perfect.

16:27.991 --> 16:30.899
Rory got dressed five minutes before you got here, and she's wearing my sweater.

16:30.981 --> 16:34.191
- I could just as easily have been the one dressed right. 
- You can wear my jacket.

16:34.252 --> 16:36.421
Do you have a samurai sword under those pom-poms, Mom?

16:36.527 --> 16:39.000
- Because you're gonna have to "Kill Bill" me to get me into that... 
- Arm.

16:39.095 --> 16:41.549
- Yes, ma'am. 
- What have you got there, Rory?

16:41.682 --> 16:43.403
- Fig Newtons. 
- Fig Newtons?

16:43.489 --> 16:44.601
A little dessert for later.

16:47.289 --> 16:49.773
- What's so funny? 
- We got the jumbo pack. We're not cheap.

16:49.875 --> 16:53.715
I'm sorry, Rory, we didn't mean to laugh at you. We love your Fig Newtons.

16:53.765 --> 16:56.970
- We will honor them and eat them proudly. 
- They're just Fig Newtons, guys.

16:57.033 --> 16:59.178
- Don't get all freaky on us. 
- Well, let's get going.

16:59.255 --> 17:01.061
- So, what time does the game start? 
- One.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.279
- One? 
- Then why the hell did we have to meet you at nine?

17:03.350 --> 17:06.619
Is it absolutely necessary for you to talk like Sharon Osbourne?

17:06.707 --> 17:07.804
You're the one with the dirty button.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.866
There's much more to the big game day than the game, Lorelai.

17:10.932 --> 17:17.348
There are all kinds of rituals and traditions we Gilmores take part in. First off, a visit to Dan.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.150
- A visit to Dan. 
- Who's Dan?

17:19.273 --> 17:20.936
- Come along, ladies. 
- Who's Dan?

17:21.296 --> 17:22.345
Button your coat.

17:23.388 --> 17:24.388
Who's Dan?

17:24.671 --> 17:27.378
Girls, I'd like you to meet Dan.

17:27.516 --> 17:33.056
- The original Handsome Dan. 
- The very first Yale mascot.

17:33.304 --> 17:35.499
- Oh, my. 
- Just look at him, will you.

17:35.601 --> 17:40.450
- Strong, determined, the very essence of dignity. 
- Got cotton stuffed in his butt. How dignified is that?

17:40.533 --> 17:45.463
You will not sully the name of Dan. This dog has been the inspiration for many a young man.

17:45.529 --> 17:48.263
- And young woman. 
- We salute you, Dan.

17:48.406 --> 17:50.526
- Time for a toast. 
- Seriously?

17:50.711 --> 17:53.936
Oh, it's a tradition. Here we go.

17:54.647 --> 17:58.908
The Rory flask. And the fun flask.

17:59.748 --> 18:01.175
- Thank you. 
- Lorelai?

18:01.252 --> 18:02.445
Fun flask, please.

18:04.867 --> 18:10.500
All right, give our boys the strength to do battle yet again for the honor of Yale,

18:10.653 --> 18:13.685
and help us send the Harvard boys home in a body bag.

18:14.253 --> 18:16.383
- Dan, we salute you. 
- To Dan.

18:16.577 --> 18:17.647
- To Dan. 
- To Dan.

18:19.214 --> 18:22.097
- I like football. 
- I must admit, throughout the years,

18:22.215 --> 18:26.105
I have often hoped to be able to share this day with my granddaughter.

18:26.202 --> 18:30.576
It's selfish, I know, but I am thrilled to be here with you, Rory.

18:30.843 --> 18:31.721
To Rory.

18:34.594 --> 18:36.027
Two more of these and I'm gonna start to understand your outfit. 

18:36.194 --> 18:42.427
Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow, Eli Yale...

18:42.567 --> 18:45.889
- What is he doing? 
- Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow...

18:46.038 --> 18:49.724
- They're joining him. 
- Apparently, everyone has a fun flask.

18:50.247 --> 18:53.512
- You know, Cole Porter wrote that song. 
- Was that before he learned to write songs?

18:53.672 --> 19:01.242
That is the sign we hail! Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow, Eli Yale!

19:03.019 --> 19:07.579
- All right, everyone, time to move on. 
- Yes, we have a lot of things to get to.

19:07.671 --> 19:10.310
Yeah, I hear there's a squirrel encased in concrete next door. We have to burn incense, 

19:10.401 --> 19:13.010
dance around his tail with nuts in our mouths.

19:13.078 --> 19:16.764
- What can I possibly do to stop you? 
- A little more of the fun flask might do the trick.

19:16.881 --> 19:19.303
- That's all until we eat. 
- Where are we going to eat?

19:19.411 --> 19:21.869
- It's a tailgate party. 
- I'm sorry, a what?

19:22.033 --> 19:25.242
Oh, well, don't look so shocked, Lorelai. Tailgating was invented at Yale.

19:25.349 --> 19:28.335
Tailgating like tailgating? Like a beer and a hot dog in the parking lot?

19:28.488 --> 19:29.970
Walk a little faster, please.

19:30.562 --> 19:32.529
- Did they say "tailgating"? 
- I think so.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.366
- I wanted to make sure it wasn't the fun flask talking. 
- Girls.

19:39.139 --> 19:41.949
- Oh, so this is tailgating. 
- It smells so good.

19:42.056 --> 19:45.334
- Hey, how are ya? Go, Yale? Hi, I'm Lorelai. 
- I'm Benny.

19:45.488 --> 19:48.827
Wow, great to meet you, Benny. Tell me about this barbecue sauce.

19:48.924 --> 19:51.791
Please don't harass people. Your daughter goes to this school.

19:51.909 --> 19:55.871
Hi, Mom, I'd like you to meet Benny. Benny, this is my mother, Emily. We were thinking a summer wedding.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.245
- It's nice to meet you. We're over there. 
- I don't care where you are.

19:59.347 --> 20:02.450
- I have found my place in life. It's here, right next to... 
- Oh, my God.

20:02.548 --> 20:03.510
- What? 
- Look.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.151
Richard, make sure he doesn't burn those.

20:07.509 --> 20:11.441
See ya, Benny. Okay, let's tailgate. I really like football.

20:17.826 --> 20:20.258
- How's that? 
- Oh, that's fine if we were in Utah.

20:20.417 --> 20:21.614
Message received.

20:22.291 --> 20:25.327
Don't keep drinking that, Richard. I'm making my Bloody Mary's.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.963
You have been working on your Bloody Mary's for an hour now.

20:28.055 --> 20:29.663
Rome wasn't built in a day.

20:30.427 --> 20:31.511
Taste that, Lorelai.

20:35.106 --> 20:37.251
- Too strong? 
- Just a tad.

20:37.363 --> 20:39.788
Yeah, I'm sitting across from it and I'm looking for a lampshade to wear. 

20:39.863 --> 20:40.988
All right, all right.

20:41.092 --> 20:44.941
Rory, come with me. I want to introduce you to some good friends of mine. 

20:45.888 --> 20:48.802
- He is so proud of that girl. 
- I know.

20:49.006 --> 20:52.872
- Sometimes that's all he can talk about. 
- Yeah, well, it's a pretty good subject.

20:52.949 --> 20:57.766
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you to my granddaughter, Rory, class of 2007.

20:57.859 --> 21:03.082
- So, any word from that little ex-hoodlum of hers? 
- No, Jess seems to be gone for good.

21:03.184 --> 21:07.397
- How is she? 
- She's Rory. She's stoic. She's a lot like Dad.

21:07.542 --> 21:09.206
She is, isn't she?

21:10.286 --> 21:14.971
- And what about you? Any men snooping around? 
- Just on trash day.

21:15.391 --> 21:17.889
- There must be someone. 
- No, no, no one.

21:18.606 --> 21:21.704
All right. Any weaker and it would simply be tomato juice.

21:24.146 --> 21:25.518
- Very nice. 
- Yes?

21:27.708 --> 21:28.429
Perfect.

21:29.076 --> 21:30.864
- Hi. 
- Hi, Paris.

21:31.011 --> 21:33.121
- Is Rory here? 
- Oh, no, she's over there with her grandfather.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.642
- She'll be right back. Mom, do you know Paris? 
- Of course I know Paris.

21:36.721 --> 21:40.331
She came to Rory's sixteenth birthday party. Nice to see you again. Would you like some lemonade?

21:40.427 --> 21:41.856
No, thank you. I won't be here long.

21:42.665 --> 21:44.114
Oh, Rory, good.

21:44.866 --> 21:46.833
- Here. 
- What's this?

21:46.929 --> 21:48.803
- I want you to take a win/lose photo. 
- A what?

21:48.891 --> 21:52.589
A photo as if we won and a photo as if we lost. That way, I have it to remember the day by.

21:52.701 --> 21:54.681
Why don't you just wait until we win or lose to take the photo?

21:54.795 --> 21:58.866
Oh, please, I'm already so bored out of my mind, I'm thinking of transferring to Princeton for the hell of it.

21:58.936 --> 22:01.743
There's no way I'm gonna make it to the game. Just take the picture so I can go home.

22:01.815 --> 22:04.191
Okay. We won.

22:04.488 --> 22:07.667
- We lost. We're done. 
- I'm out of here.

22:07.820 --> 22:11.148
- Oh, hello, Paris. Join us for some food? 
- No, thanks, Richard.

22:11.251 --> 22:13.504
Oh, by the way, thanks again for introducing me to Asher Fleming. 

22:13.601 --> 22:14.984
Oh, did you get your interview?

22:15.053 --> 22:19.213
- No, not yet, but I'm working on it. 
- Well, I pity him if he tries to resist too long.

22:19.314 --> 22:21.670
- Oh, so do I. Bye. 
- Bye, Paris.

22:23.827 --> 22:27.179
- She's an odd little duck, that one. 
- Don't I get one of those?

22:27.451 --> 22:28.802
Well, of course you do.

22:29.443 --> 22:32.186
- Richard, Emily, hello. 
- Pennilyn.

22:32.622 --> 22:34.281
- Nice to see you. 
- How are things?

22:34.393 --> 22:36.283
- Perfect. You? 
- Lovely. How's work?

22:36.371 --> 22:38.495
- Just fine. How's Stephen? 
- Oh, you know.

22:38.623 --> 22:41.715
- This is our daughter, Lorelai, and our granddaughter, Rory. 
- Hello.

22:41.771 --> 22:43.604
- It's been so long, we must catch up. 
- You'll call?

22:43.686 --> 22:44.786
- Of course. 
- Well, then...

22:45.017 --> 22:49.186
Oh, wait, are you Pennilyn Lott, my dad's college sweetheart?

22:49.427 --> 22:51.623
- Yes. 
- You're my almost-mommy.

22:52.611 --> 22:55.934
- Well, I suppose you could put it that way. 
- I'm so glad to finally meet you.

22:56.031 --> 22:58.805
Let me ask you something - would you have let me get a pony?

22:59.103 --> 23:02.247
- I'll call you, Pennilyn. 
- Yes, I look forward to it.

23:02.349 --> 23:03.225
Bye.

23:03.943 --> 23:07.726
- Lorelai! Does anything work above your neck? 
- What?

23:07.811 --> 23:10.506
- What were you thinking? 
- I'm sorry, I was just trying to talk to her.

23:10.583 --> 23:12.964
We do not talk to Pennilyn Lott. 

23:13.055 --> 23:15.846
We run into her once a year. We say hello, goodbye, and that is it.

23:15.927 --> 23:19.270
- We do not have conversations, we do not talk about our lives. 
- But Mom...

23:19.332 --> 23:23.910
We do not joke with Pennilyn Lott. We do not refer to Pennilyn Lott as anything but Pennilyn Lott,

23:23.982 --> 23:25.759
and I would appreciate you remembering that.

23:26.578 --> 23:28.509
Okay, seriously time for the fun flask.

23:32.528 --> 23:34.341
- Hey, Patty. 
- Hi, sweetie.

23:34.458 --> 23:35.462
- Gypsy. 
- Hey Luke.

23:35.552 --> 23:36.865
- Reverend Skinner. 
- Afternoon, son.

23:36.967 --> 23:40.085
- Oh, hey, Kirk, I got that cheese in you like. 
- The Pepper Jack?

23:40.167 --> 23:43.275
Pepper Jack, yes. Anyway, it's here, it's in if you're coming by today. 

23:43.374 --> 23:45.416
- Are you? 
- Am I coming by today?

23:45.528 --> 23:46.762
- Yes. 
- No, not today.

23:47.023 --> 23:52.987
Kirk, listen, I got that cheese just for you. Do not leave me with three pounds of Pepper Jack on my hands.

23:53.081 --> 23:54.841
- I won't. 
- What are you doing here anyway?

23:54.943 --> 23:56.828
- Standing in line. 
- Why are you standing in line?

23:56.926 --> 23:58.165
Because I'm a follower.

23:58.681 --> 24:00.150
- Patty? 
- Yes, Luke?

24:00.248 --> 24:05.348
- What are all these people standing in line for? 
- Well, it seems like such a nice day for pie.

24:05.875 --> 24:08.580
- What's going on here? 
- I'm sticking to the pie story.

24:08.692 --> 24:11.098
- Why do you need a pie story, Kirk? 
- Ask Gypsy.

24:11.267 --> 24:15.252
- Don't pawn this off on me. 
- Will somebody tell me what the hell is going on?

24:15.342 --> 24:17.026
- Luke... 
- Oh, sorry, Reverend.

24:17.133 --> 24:20.503
- No, I was just gonna tell you what's going on. 
- Oh, good. Go ahead.

24:20.596 --> 24:23.232
- We're all here for lunch. 
- Since when does Weston's serve lunch?

24:23.308 --> 24:26.560
- We're sorry, Luke. We really are. 
- You're sorry about what?

24:26.694 --> 24:31.194
- About not eating at your diner anymore. 
- You're not eating at my diner anymore? Why?

24:31.282 --> 24:32.909
- We hate the kid. 
- Brennon?

24:33.052 --> 24:34.401
Brennon, Satan, whatever. 

24:34.502 --> 24:37.481
Wait a minute, don't you think you're all just overreacting a little bit?

24:37.558 --> 24:39.595
- He's just a kid. 
- A really weird kid.

24:39.718 --> 24:44.977
He'll be looking directly at you and start laughing. No one knows why. He's just there, laughing.

24:45.076 --> 24:48.264
He laughs? That's why you hate him? The kid laughs?

24:48.356 --> 24:50.521
- You'd have to hear it. 
- I don't believe you people.

24:50.634 --> 24:55.709
You've been coming to my diner for years, and now, all of a sudden, because I give a local kid a break,

24:55.770 --> 25:01.683
try to teach him a skill, give him a chance to get a little extra cash, a little independence, you all just up and leave?

25:01.735 --> 25:08.176
I mean, so he's not the most popular kid in town. If I remember correctly, I wasn't exactly the most popular kid in town either.

25:08.249 --> 25:14.064
- Yeah, but you didn't do that laughing thing. 
- Yeah, whatever I did, I grew up, I got responsible.

25:14.140 --> 25:17.254
This town gave me a chance, and I proved them right.

25:17.315 --> 25:21.724
Now you're all just gonna stand there and tell me that that's it, that you've given out all the passes that you had

25:21.811 --> 25:27.228
and you're not coming to my diner anymore because you don't like Brennon? Well, fine.

25:27.304 --> 25:34.309
Fine! Do not come to my diner. From now on, every day is a nice day for pie.

25:45.198 --> 25:47.129
Just give me ten minutes.

25:52.225 --> 25:55.142
I think I have officially eaten a third of a cow.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.298
The steak is incredible.

25:57.559 --> 26:00.411
I'm glad you're all enjoying it. Lorelai, how's your steak?

26:01.067 --> 26:05.204
- Why do you ask? 
- That's it. Hand over the flask.

26:05.326 --> 26:08.440
- I do not know what you're talking about. There's no flask here. 
- What's going on over there?

26:09.372 --> 26:12.659
- Oh, Richard, it's Dan. 
- Dan? It's Dan! It's Dan!

26:13.272 --> 26:15.368
- I thought we already saw Dan. 
- This is the current Dan.

26:15.752 --> 26:17.651
- Emily, get his bone. 
- Got it.

26:18.798 --> 26:23.851
- Here you go, Dan. 
- Enjoy it now. I just saw your future and it ain't good.

26:23.943 --> 26:25.453
Rory, hey.

26:26.806 --> 26:28.705
- Hey, did you see Dan? 
- Well, you can't help it. 

26:28.806 --> 26:31.045
He's everywhere today in one form or another.

26:31.128 --> 26:34.198
- I want you to meet my mom. 
- I'll distract them, and you make a run for it.

26:34.286 --> 26:38.079
Dan, are you listening to me? Stop eating. Your freedom's at stake here.

26:38.382 --> 26:40.146
- Mom? 
- I was just petting him.

26:40.260 --> 26:43.461
- I want you to meet Marty. 
- Oh, naked guy.

26:43.829 --> 26:46.425
- You told your mother about me. 
- Yeah.

26:46.521 --> 26:48.205
Well, I included some anecdotes where you were actually clothed, too. 

26:48.321 --> 26:50.045
Oh, I appreciate that.

26:50.137 --> 26:53.593
- And who is this young man? 
- This is Marty. He lives in my residence hall.

26:53.696 --> 26:58.160
- It's very nice to meet you, Marty. 
- Why did my daughter just call you "naked guy"?

26:58.257 --> 27:02.486
- I now owe you money. 
- I had an unfortunate experience with a keg

27:02.557 --> 27:05.706
and a party and a need to take my clothes off and fall asleep in a hallway. 

27:05.807 --> 27:06.926
Oh, my goodness.

27:06.998 --> 27:08.544
Oh, please, that's nothing.

27:08.656 --> 27:11.570
- I was naked an entire month my sophomore year. 
- What?

27:11.641 --> 27:14.698
Welcome to tonight's episode of "Things I Never Needed to Know About My Father."

27:14.929 --> 27:22.112
I and a group of like-minded young men decided to protest the new dress code by wearing silk ties and nothing else.

27:22.189 --> 27:25.123
We were written up by the dean of admissions and threatened with expulsion.

27:25.369 --> 27:28.816
- We were also suddenly very popular with the ladies. 
- Ah, yes.

27:28.912 --> 27:34.076
This is exactly the kind of conversation I had hoped we would have with our granddaughter and her friend.

27:34.124 --> 27:38.808
One night in the hallway does not a true naked guy make, my friend.

27:38.951 --> 27:44.721
- Would you like to eat with us, Marty? 
- Oh, I would love to. It looks amazing. But I have to go.

27:44.810 --> 27:50.656
There's kind of a party going on over on the lawn, and I actually came by to see if Rory wanted to stop by for a little while.

27:50.779 --> 27:54.219
- Oh, I can't. 
- Oh, nonsense, of course you can go.

27:54.307 --> 27:56.785
- Go visit your friends. I insist. 
- Are you sure?

27:56.878 --> 27:59.002
We've got plenty of time before the kickoff, go.

27:59.279 --> 28:00.952
- Okay. 
- Take this with you.

28:01.054 --> 28:04.715
Thanks. It was nice meeting you. Obi-wan.

28:07.532 --> 28:10.266
- I like that boy. 
- Prove it. Drop your pants.

28:10.573 --> 28:12.099
- All right, come on. 
- Come on where?

28:12.232 --> 28:14.725
- It's time to go to the ladies' room. 
- It is? Was there a memo, or...

28:14.817 --> 28:18.116
It's an hour before kickoff. The lines won't be long. Grab your purse. You'll thank me later.

28:19.784 --> 28:20.859
I'll meet you right outside.

28:24.992 --> 28:25.898
Coffee, please.

28:34.496 --> 28:35.862
- Here you go. 
- Thanks.

28:40.197 --> 28:42.794
Of course there's a line. Why wouldn't there be?

28:42.983 --> 28:45.840
- You know, you kind of want to hang out here anyhow. 
- Why is that?

28:45.922 --> 28:48.590
- Some woman just took her forty-year-old son in there. 
- No.

28:48.672 --> 28:52.178
He might not be forty, but the images he's gathering up in there will last until he gets there.

28:52.256 --> 28:54.022
- Why do women do that? 
- I don't know.

28:54.114 --> 28:57.876
When I was growing up, there was such a thing as modesty. I suppose that's not in fashion now.

28:57.949 --> 29:01.789
- Nope, modesty went punk. 
- So, I hear you're opening an inn.

29:01.896 --> 29:04.242
- Well, trying to. 
- That sounds very exciting.

29:04.330 --> 29:05.229
It is.

29:05.512 --> 29:09.177
- Pennilyn, we're just running into you all over the place. 
- Yes, you are.

29:09.269 --> 29:12.428
- Well, it's a nice treat. Enjoy the game. 
- Same to you.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.388
- Oops, the line's moving. 
- Oh, I'll see you later.

29:15.547 --> 29:17.446
Yes. Let's go, Lorelai.

29:17.953 --> 29:19.822
Did you see the woman with the forty-year-old kid?

29:23.545 --> 29:27.855
Oh, Emily, good. I can't remember whether it's two shakes of Tabasco or four.

29:27.952 --> 29:31.438
- I'll do it. 
- I did however remember how much vodka goes in there.

29:31.511 --> 29:33.759
- You're going to have to move if you want me to make them. 
- But I don't want to move.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.198
I want to stand right here, dangerously close to my wife as long as...

29:38.285 --> 29:39.611
Whiffenpoofs!

29:49.257 --> 29:53.752
There's no celery. Sandy, I told you to cut enough celery for the entire day.

30:06.629 --> 30:09.558
- He's gonna be in so much pain tomorrow. 
- What is this?

30:09.772 --> 30:13.322
- Sandy, what is this? 
- It's the cookies.

30:13.475 --> 30:18.611
It's the cookies my granddaughter brought. I told you to place them on a doily, not just dump them on a plate.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.863
- I'm sorry. 
- Take them, fix them.

30:22.039 --> 30:23.496
And where's the celery?

30:24.780 --> 30:28.411
- I can get you celery, Mom. 
- I didn't hire you to get me celery.

30:28.548 --> 30:31.978
- I know, but I'm happy to help. 
- Sandy, I don't want to ask you again.

30:32.107 --> 30:34.273
- Is something wrong, Mom? 
- No, nothing's wrong.

30:34.503 --> 30:37.272
These are the best Bloody Mary's I have ever tasted.

30:37.518 --> 30:41.798
- Emily, let's give these boys some refreshments. 
- We can't give them any refreshments

30:41.885 --> 30:45.818
because we don't have any celery even though I've been asking for it repeatedly for the last ten minutes.

30:45.895 --> 30:47.636
We can drink them without celery.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.503
How does Pennilyn Lott know that Lorelai's opening an inn?

30:50.979 --> 30:55.602
- Excuse me? 
- She knows that Lorelai's opening an inn. How did she know?

30:55.788 --> 30:59.360
- Well... 
- I didn't tell her. I don't think Lorelai told her.

30:59.448 --> 31:02.657
I can't remember the last time Rory and Pennilyn had a hen party. 

31:02.748 --> 31:03.457
Mom...

31:03.559 --> 31:07.716
Once a year - that's when we talk to her. Once a year, right here at the game.

31:07.783 --> 31:11.812
We say hello, we ask about her health, we ask about her children, and if Stephen's not here, we ask about him.

31:11.874 --> 31:14.214
- How did she know? 
- I told her.

31:14.501 --> 31:16.681
- Run. 
- When?

31:17.522 --> 31:19.943
About six months ago. We had lunch.

31:20.317 --> 31:22.385
- Where? 
- At a restaurant.

31:22.559 --> 31:24.280
- What restaurant? 
- You don't know it.

31:24.568 --> 31:27.168
- Why don't I know it? 
- Because you've never been there.

31:27.275 --> 31:29.533
How do you know I've never been there? You don't know everything about me.

31:29.620 --> 31:32.512
I don't know everything about you. I didn't know you were having lunch with Pennilyn Lott.

31:32.594 --> 31:34.050
We obviously don't know everything about each other. 

31:34.154 --> 31:36.250
- What restaurant? 
- Adele's.

31:36.307 --> 31:39.971
- I've never been there. 
- We just had lunch and talked. Two old friends.

31:40.045 --> 31:46.276
How nice. So, after all of these years of not having lunch and not talking, you two decide to get together and catch up.

31:46.363 --> 31:49.629
- Whose idea was it? 
- Emily, could we discuss this in the trailer?

31:49.701 --> 31:53.414
- We will discuss this right here. Whose idea was it? 
- I don't know.

31:53.500 --> 31:59.352
We've been having lunch once a year for many years. It's just a little tradition.

31:59.439 --> 32:03.197
- Every year since when? 
- Every year since we got married.

32:03.571 --> 32:08.268
Emily, please don't make this more dramatic than it has to be.

32:08.410 --> 32:13.074
- No, I certainly wouldn't want to do that. 
- Pennilyn and I are just friends.

32:13.258 --> 32:16.464
We just wanted to keep track of each other. That was it.

32:16.828 --> 32:21.906
- So, you've lied to me for the last 39 years. 
- Well, she didn't tell Stephen. It was only lunch.

32:22.024 --> 32:24.968
- Only lunch, yes. 
- Emily, I...

32:25.090 --> 32:26.791
I think you should go for a walk, Richard.

32:28.966 --> 32:30.600
I'll be back before the game.

32:33.211 --> 32:38.013
Mom, I know it was wrong, but I'm sure Dad just didn't want to get you upset.

32:38.137 --> 32:43.219
Well, then perhaps he shouldn't have lied to me for the last 39 years. That's a surefire way not to get me upset.

32:43.283 --> 32:47.194
- That's true, but it was just lunch. 
- It was lunch with Pennilyn Lott, Lorelai,

32:47.270 --> 32:50.166
the woman you insisted on talking to even though I told you not to. 

32:50.270 --> 32:50.866
I didn't...

32:50.952 --> 32:55.673
Your stubbornness is astounding to me. I asked you over and over to please refrain from talking to her.

32:55.765 --> 32:58.478
- You asked me once, and... 
- But no, you had to push it,

32:58.556 --> 33:01.546
- and now look what's happened! Are you happy? 
- Are you seriously blaming me for this?

33:01.632 --> 33:04.762
- You had to talk to her! 
- I didn't have lunch with her, Mom. Dad did.

33:04.828 --> 33:09.133
I wouldn't have known! If you hadn't talked to her, I wouldn't have known, and everything would have been fine!

33:09.206 --> 33:12.718
- So you'd rather just be in denial about things, Mom? 
- Everything would have been fine!

33:12.804 --> 33:15.594
But Dad still would have been having lunch with this woman once a year.

33:15.692 --> 33:18.889
You weren't even supposed to come. It was supposed to be your father and me and Rory.

33:18.963 --> 33:20.553
- You weren't supposed to come! 
- Okay!

33:25.133 --> 33:26.281
This is Jason Stiles.

33:26.870 --> 33:31.023
- You still have those reservations? 
- Should I... no.

33:31.395 --> 33:34.094
- Gonna let it go. I'll pick you up at eight. 
- Okay.

33:34.222 --> 33:38.579
- And wear something completely evil. 
- So, horns, tail, and my Wolfowitz t-shirt?

33:38.686 --> 33:40.181
- Perfect. 
- Bye.

33:51.288 --> 33:52.731
Oh, man, this place is crazy.

33:52.843 --> 33:56.063
You know they flew in the top prostitutes from Hong Kong to work that coat check.

33:56.162 --> 34:00.805
Oh, God, I hope that's true. Okay, is there a star? We need a star.

34:01.620 --> 34:02.655
- Bingo. 
- Where?

34:02.787 --> 34:03.960
- Ted Koppel's here. 
- Where?

34:04.063 --> 34:07.324
- Right there. 
- Oh, dear, so he really does look like that.

34:09.351 --> 34:12.524
- The name is Stiles, for two. 
- I love that Ted Koppel's here.

34:13.652 --> 34:14.643
Follow me.

34:15.847 --> 34:18.071
- Look how she seats us right away. 
- You like that, huh?

34:18.183 --> 34:23.001
I do like that. Now, if she seats us next to Ted, we have to make sure to become his best friends

34:23.078 --> 34:26.293
- so he invites us to all those famous newscaster parties. 
- Oh, that sounds fabulous.

34:28.884 --> 34:32.068
- Miss? 
- Yes? Oh, me? Sorry. Thank you.

34:33.706 --> 34:34.578
Thank you.

34:36.329 --> 34:37.848
Your waiter will be in in a moment.

34:43.818 --> 34:47.039
- Nice, huh? 
- Yes, very nice.

34:47.833 --> 34:50.623
Quiet. You could hear a pin drop.

35:07.137 --> 35:09.568
So, how are you feeling tonight? Red, white, or gin-soaked?

35:09.711 --> 35:11.216
- Red's good. 
- Red it is.

35:11.881 --> 35:15.389
- So, I'm sorry, is this where we're going to eat? 
- That's right.

35:15.506 --> 35:16.752
Oh, okay.

35:17.290 --> 35:21.840
- Did they run out of tables or something? 
- I requested this room.

35:21.969 --> 35:23.064
- You requested it? 
- Yes.

35:23.212 --> 35:25.860
- You asked for it on purpose? 
- Hey, it's very hard to get this room.

35:25.941 --> 35:30.862
- Everybody wants it, and now we've got it. 
- Yes, we do, we have it. Lucky us.

35:33.745 --> 35:38.102
It's just that everything's kinda going on out there.

35:38.731 --> 35:42.899
- So? 
- Don't you wanna be out there with everybody else?

35:43.309 --> 35:44.948
- Why? 
- Because it's fun.

35:45.209 --> 35:48.158
You know, all the people and the noise, you can't even hear yourself think.

35:48.429 --> 35:50.913
But that's the point of coming to a place like this.

35:51.086 --> 35:54.639
I thought the point of coming to a place like this would be to enjoy the food and the atmosphere.

35:54.742 --> 35:57.896
Yes, but all of the atmosphere is out there.

35:59.672 --> 36:02.237
- You don't like the room. 
- No, it's...

36:03.149 --> 36:09.166
it is weird, you know. I mean, the two of us sitting all alone in here.

36:09.345 --> 36:12.647
I feel like we're quarantined. It's like the ebola room or something.

36:12.914 --> 36:15.207
Okay, I don't know what to do.

36:15.955 --> 36:20.240
- Why don't we ask for a table out there? 
- Oh, no, the place is booked solid.

36:20.311 --> 36:22.139
- We could eat at the bar. 
- I don't eat at the bar.

36:22.241 --> 36:24.638
- Why not? 
- I don't like stools. Your feet hang.

36:24.710 --> 36:27.623
Hey, this is a fancy place. Someone will hold them.

36:27.828 --> 36:31.581
- Maybe we should just go. 
- Oh, Jason...

36:31.765 --> 36:36.783
No, you're uncomfortable. It's fine. Let's go. Ted would.

36:52.901 --> 36:54.913
We could go someplace else. You must be starving.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.699
You know, I'm not. I had a lot of food today.

36:57.831 --> 37:01.661
Right, you tailgated. Okay, so, home?

37:02.997 --> 37:05.123
Okay, yeah, home's fine.

37:05.481 --> 37:08.721
- We could try this again some other time. 
- Absolutely.

37:12.388 --> 37:15.321
- Oh my God, I'm starving. 
- You just said you weren't.

37:15.414 --> 37:18.342
- Well, I lied. 
- Well, good, 'cause I'm starving, too.

37:18.430 --> 37:21.451
- Well, you should have said something. 
- Well, our date was dinner. It was implied.

37:22.211 --> 37:24.527
- Oh, okay, next exit. 
- What?

37:24.614 --> 37:27.645
- Get off at the next exit, do it, do it. 
- Okay, doing it, doing it.

37:35.638 --> 37:39.529
Oh, this place, hands down, the best tacos on the East Coast. You're gonna be very happy.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.314
- Good to know. 
- Welcome to Taco Barn, may I take your order?

37:42.401 --> 37:48.479
Hi. Um, two tacos, an order of taquitos, a beef burrito with no onions, and, don't bother bagging it,

37:48.530 --> 37:51.448
- that'll just slow us down. Go ahead. 
- Nothing for me.

37:51.823 --> 37:53.901
- What? 
- No, nothing, thanks.

37:54.464 --> 37:58.346
- You said you were starving. 
- Yeah, I'm just not big on Mexican food.

37:58.453 --> 38:01.775
- Trust me, this stuff bears no resemblance to Mexican food. 
- It's okay, I'm good.

38:01.986 --> 38:06.004
Okay. Well, I'm not gonna eat if you're not gonna eat.

38:06.173 --> 38:08.720
- What is this, junior high? 
- No, no, I just...

38:09.200 --> 38:11.397
- I don't wanna sit in a car and eat by myself. 
- Why?

38:11.535 --> 38:14.849
- Because it's not fun. 
- Well, does everything have to be fun for you?

38:14.991 --> 38:18.793
- When I'm on a date, yeah. 
- Oh, please, come on, just get the food.

38:18.902 --> 38:22.307
- No, no, let's go. 
- No, the tacos. You love the tacos.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.642
- I'm not hungry. 
- You are too hungry.

38:24.750 --> 38:29.168
- Forget it. Let's go. 
- Okay, I'm going.

38:33.871 --> 38:38.854
- I told you to get the tacos. 
- Let's not do this again, okay? I just need to eat something.

38:38.942 --> 38:41.369
- This is a supermarket. 
- I'm gonna throw my purse at you.

38:41.460 --> 38:44.774
- You have to cook anything you buy here. 
- Jason, come on.

38:45.199 --> 38:46.101
- Come on what? 
- There are a million things here. 

38:46.203 --> 38:51.763
There's cheese and fruit and chips and a whole prepared-food section. Now grab this basket and look.

38:51.994 --> 38:53.749
- Do you want to start with the salad? 
- Okay.

38:58.267 --> 39:00.461
- What did you just do? 
- I need razors.

39:00.533 --> 39:02.653
- No, no, this is an errand. 
- So?

39:02.837 --> 39:06.866
So we're looking for food and you're running errands.

39:06.980 --> 39:09.001
I'm a busy man. I don't have time to do these things.

39:09.099 --> 39:10.166
- We're on a date! 
- We're in a store, 

39:10.259 --> 39:12.566
they're right there. Now I don't have to go tomorrow.

39:12.636 --> 39:16.481
But a date isn't about convenience. You're not supposed to be thinking about the things you need.

39:16.722 --> 39:19.493
- Oh, shoot, I'm out of toothpaste. 
- Grab it.

39:21.130 --> 39:23.446
- Where are you going? 
- I need hand soap.

39:24.479 --> 39:27.879
All right. I'll grab some paper towels and meet you in the prepared-food section.

39:27.988 --> 39:30.958
- Fine. Which way is detergent? 
- That way.

39:36.251 --> 39:39.762
- Hey, you need peas? 'Cause there's two for one. 
- No, I'm good.

39:40.008 --> 39:42.645
- I'm getting you a couple anyhow. 
- Where are you?

39:42.830 --> 39:47.232
- Let's see, there's Jell-o and tiny cocktail wieners. 
- Oh, I'm one aisle over.

39:47.541 --> 39:48.749
I'll be right there.

39:50.924 --> 39:54.380
Boy, I gotta tell you, the advice about not shopping hungry couldn't be truer.

39:54.468 --> 39:56.807
- Good Lord, that's a lot of food. 
- Well, it's not all just food.

39:56.947 --> 40:00.055
- So you won't eat fast food, but Sno Balls are okay? 
- I've never eaten them. I was curious.

40:00.183 --> 40:02.191
Sno Balls. Pink marshmallow coconut balls. 

40:02.283 --> 40:04.791
You wouldn't be curious about pink marshmallow coconut balls?

40:04.841 --> 40:09.843
Who makes these? How did the decision to dye the coconut pink occur? Why are they shaped like a chest?

40:09.884 --> 40:12.542
Is there any dessert on the fact of the planet that could stimulate this much debate?

40:12.613 --> 40:14.676
- I don't know. 
- What are you looking for?

40:14.774 --> 40:18.009
- Well, they usually have the mini size of these chips. 
- Get the big one.

40:18.091 --> 40:19.824
I grab them on the way out of the house and this won't fit in my purse. 

40:19.921 --> 40:22.024
Well, they must have them.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.537
- Hold on a second. 
- Where are you going?

40:24.651 --> 40:27.451
- Just watch my Sno Balls, please. 
- Not on the first date, mister.

40:32.079 --> 40:32.997
Let's go.

40:33.673 --> 40:35.454
- Where? 
- Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

40:43.059 --> 40:44.875
- Ten minutes. 
- That's all we need.

40:46.850 --> 40:48.878
- What are we doing here? 
- We're looking for your chips.

40:49.211 --> 40:51.930
- Seriously? 
- Well, this is where they keep the goods.

40:52.170 --> 40:54.106
How did you get the guy to let us in the back room?

40:54.213 --> 40:57.081
Talking people into doing things that they don't wanna do happens to be my specialty.

40:57.189 --> 41:00.511
Look, a time clock. Let's clock in. Do you wanna be Lucy or Jamal?

41:00.741 --> 41:04.059
Either one. What were the chips you like?

41:04.168 --> 41:05.303
Sour cream and onion.

41:06.553 --> 41:07.767
Ah, got 'em.

41:09.201 --> 41:12.805
- Oh, it's just like heaven. 
- Here. Wanna do the honors?

41:14.024 --> 41:18.109
- I feel so powerful. 
- Well, you're holding a knife. Being armed does that to people.

41:24.681 --> 41:29.584
- Wow, Cap'n Crunch. I lived on Cap'n Crunch in college. 
- Cut him.

41:29.726 --> 41:33.335
- Cut Cap'n Crunch? That seems a bit severe. 
- Trust me, he's got it coming.

41:33.873 --> 41:36.750
Okay, I just hope Jamal doesn't get busted for this.

41:40.058 --> 41:42.221
- Mac and cheese? 
- Yeah, please, delicious.

41:43.094 --> 41:46.381
You know, I must say, this is a pretty nice spread we put together here.

41:46.473 --> 41:50.145
- A little ingenuity. 
- It's too bad they stop selling alcohol after 9:30.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.327
I mean, not that I need to be drunk to have dinner with you.

41:52.951 --> 41:56.408
- Oh, the fun flask. 
- Excuse me?

41:56.928 --> 41:59.197
I swiped the fun flask.

41:59.729 --> 42:02.586
- So, tell me something. 
- Yes?

42:02.955 --> 42:04.057
Why'd you change your mind?

42:04.740 --> 42:08.377
- No reason. 
- You seemed to be pretty determined.

42:08.505 --> 42:11.767
- Yes, I did. 
- And you had some pretty good logic backing you up.

42:11.869 --> 42:12.868
I always do. 

42:12.969 --> 42:17.968
So between the phone call where you said no and eight hours ago, what happened?

42:18.300 --> 42:22.611
Well, I went to the Harvard-Yale game with Rory and my parents.

42:22.729 --> 42:24.859
Yes, that's how I get all of my girls.

42:25.642 --> 42:32.969
And there was this thing with my mother. And it just... well, she was just...

42:33.133 --> 42:38.375
- I thought, and... so here we are? 
- So here we are.

42:39.999 --> 42:45.606
Listen, whatever it is your mother did today, do you think she might do it again tomorrow night?

42:47.137 --> 42:49.338
I think there's an excellent possibility.

42:50.091 --> 42:52.283
Okay, I'm gonna go for the giant egg rolls. Do you want one?

42:52.477 --> 42:54.899
- Yes, please, and don't forget the hot mustard. 
- Right.

42:57.369 --> 42:59.563
- Hello? 
- So how was it?

42:59.686 --> 43:01.873
- It's still going on. 
- Really, how dirty.

43:01.955 --> 43:05.194
- We're at the West Hills market drinking booze out of paper cups. 
- Really, how pathetic.

43:05.295 --> 43:08.676
- He made sure I got my potato chips. 
- Really, how confusing.

43:08.809 --> 43:12.348
- I'll explain later. How are the grandparents? 
- Not speaking.

43:12.476 --> 43:14.759
- Must have been one hell of a game. 
- I read.

43:14.897 --> 43:17.980
- I'm sorry I bailed. 
- You owe me nothing but the gory details.

43:18.068 --> 43:19.006
I might like him. 

43:19.098 --> 43:22.896
Just remember, you're sleeping with every single person he's ever slept with.

43:23.043 --> 43:25.153
- Thank you for that. 
- Call me tomorrow.

43:25.255 --> 43:26.285
You got it.
