of another character

But as soon as we moved up
to the higher-velocity round

it went right through it.

is sharpen some sticks,

21:34.767 --> 21:36.199

at the primer.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.599
Right, and the idea is, when
the wolves come into the camp,

they poke the stick,
the shotgun shell goes off...

it's down to the bomb range

22:06.833 --> 22:08.932

22:08.933 --> 22:11.132
Now, for this myth
to be plausible,

22:11.133 --> 22:12.499
we need to see two things.

All right, so this movie version

I opened it up,

23:45.967 --> 23:48.832
But, unfortunately,
it blunted the tip.

Now, normally, to deform it, you
would use a steel firing pin,

we need to use wood.

24:10.467 --> 24:13.332
Now, brass has
a brinell hardness of 60,

24:13.333 --> 24:16.399

28:34.467 --> 28:36.899
Jamie: Before we pull the
trigger on this gun in a vacuum,

28:36.900 --> 28:40.832
we're gonna fire the gun in the
vacuum chamber without a vacuum

28:40.833 --> 28:43.932
to be able to compare the two.

28:43.933 --> 28:47.067
In three, two, one.

28:54.267 --> 28:57.532
There it goes.

28:57.533 --> 28:58.767
That was a bang.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.366
Well, seemed to work
pretty well.

29:01.367 --> 29:02.799
Indeed.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.199
Narrator: Yep, they've tested
the remote-firing mechanism,

29:05.200 --> 29:07.732
captured it on high-speed,

29:07.733 --> 29:11.599
and have a slug impact
on the backboard to compare.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.732
It's time to reload...

29:13.733 --> 29:16.932
Gun is hot.
Range is hot.

29:16.933 --> 29:18.499
And suck some air.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.366
And Adam, for one, is confident

29:20.367 --> 29:23.832
that in this instance,
Hollywood has it right.

29:23.833 --> 29:26.066
We're waiting for our
vacuum chamber to come
up to a full vacuum,

29:26.067 --> 29:28.066
and then we're gonna pull
the trigger on our revolver,

29:28.067 --> 29:30.399
and i am here to tell you that
i think it's gonna go "bang."

29:30.400 --> 29:32.366
I don't think the vacuum's
gonna have any effect

29:32.367 --> 29:35.199
on the gunpowder's ability
to propel the bullet

29:35.200 --> 29:37.099
out the barrel of our revolver.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.732
This is it. With the chamber
evacuated to a full vacuum...

29:39.733 --> 29:41.499
Are you ready?
I'm ready.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.432
And Adam's remote finger
on the trigger...

29:44.433 --> 29:45.732
All right. Here we go.

29:45.733 --> 29:47.499
Will Hollywood have its day,

29:47.500 --> 29:50.799
or, as the myth suggests,
will the gun misfire?

29:50.800 --> 29:53.232
[ Sighs ]
Firing a gun in a vacuum.

29:53.233 --> 29:56.533
Three, two, one.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.599
There it is.
There it is.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.299
Successfully shot.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.299
That gun fired in a vacuum!

30:07.300 --> 30:08.267
It did.

30:08.268 --> 30:12.566
The images are spectacular...

30:12.567 --> 30:13.599
Wow!

30:13.600 --> 30:16.132
And the details fascinating.

30:16.133 --> 30:18.366
I swear, if i just saw
this footage,

30:18.367 --> 30:21.366
i would totally believe
that it was a special effect.

30:21.367 --> 30:22.799
It doesn't look real.
Yeah.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.100
Amazing.

30:26.500 --> 30:29.299
But exactly what happened?

30:29.300 --> 30:32.799
Cue forensic duo
doctors hyneman and savage.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.666
Adam: Now that we know a gun
can fire in a vacuum,

30:35.667 --> 30:37.532
the question arises,
does the bullet behave

30:37.533 --> 30:39.532
any differently in the vacuum
than in the air?

30:39.533 --> 30:42.499
We might posit that the bullet
would move slower in the air

30:42.500 --> 30:44.432
because the air
provides resistance,

30:44.433 --> 30:45.999
where the vacuum provides none.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.999
And, in fact, we did find
a very minor difference.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.499
The bullet in the air
traveled 5% slower

30:51.500 --> 30:53.332
than its partner in the vacuum.

30:53.333 --> 30:55.332
That's not a big result,

30:55.333 --> 30:58.532
but it is also borne out
in a tiny way

30:58.533 --> 31:01.299
by the bullets that we found
embedded in the glass.

31:01.300 --> 31:04.466
The bullet in the vacuum made
a slightly larger pressure ring

31:04.467 --> 31:08.066
in the glass
than the one in the air.

31:08.067 --> 31:11.400
It's a tiny difference, but
an interesting one nonetheless.

31:12.767 --> 31:14.366
We chose a revolver
for this test,

31:14.367 --> 31:16.266
and you'll notice
in the high-speed footage

31:16.267 --> 31:18.932
that a fireball is created
around the gun when it fires.

31:18.933 --> 31:20.599
Now, that's because of the gases

31:20.600 --> 31:22.532
coming out of the cartridge
to escape.

31:22.533 --> 31:23.799
If you look at the vacuum,

31:23.800 --> 31:26.566
that fireball
is much, much larger,

31:26.567 --> 31:30.699
and that is because a gas,
when it's exposed to a vacuum,

31:30.700 --> 31:32.499
is going to expand more.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.066
And that makes me think

31:34.067 --> 31:36.799
that if you had an explosion
in space...

31:36.800 --> 31:40.732
Like you've seen
in countless Sci-Fi movies,

31:40.733 --> 31:43.099
that explosion
would be much larger

31:43.100 --> 31:46.300
than it would be under normal
atmospheric pressure.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.799
So, the myth that guns
cannot be fired

31:49.800 --> 31:51.232
within the vacuum of space?

31:51.233 --> 31:53.066
It's totally busted.

31:53.067 --> 31:54.332
Yeah. It's busted.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.867
Let's move on
to the next gun myth.

32:02.067 --> 32:06.200
Narrator: Up next, Tory sets
his sights on the lights.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.399
All right, Tory. So, you brought
us to the gun range.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.632
What's the myth?

32:12.633 --> 32:14.832
Now, you've seen this
in so many Hollywood movies,

32:14.833 --> 32:16.599
where somebody shoots out
a neon sign

32:16.600 --> 32:19.699
and sparks go flying
everywhere, just like this.

32:19.700 --> 32:22.299
Aah!
[ Laughs ]

32:22.300 --> 32:24.299
All right, so,
that was pretty Hollywood.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.499
Good old special effects.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.932
We're gonna have to make
some more neon signs.

32:28.933 --> 32:31.166
And get some real guns,
and then we can shoot them.

32:31.167 --> 32:33.233
This is gonna be awesome.

32:36.067 --> 32:38.732
Narrator:
A Hollywood downtown showdown

32:38.733 --> 32:42.866
wouldn't be complete without
obligatory neon-sign fireworks.

32:42.867 --> 32:46.432
But is this light show
a complete fiction?

32:46.433 --> 32:51.299
Will it really fizz and spark
without special-effects fakery?

32:51.300 --> 32:53.799
Now, the way they create sparks
in the movies

32:53.800 --> 32:56.466
is by using a paintball gun
and a paintball round

32:56.467 --> 32:59.132
that has zirconium
and an abrasive substance.

32:59.133 --> 33:00.466
When they fire it
through the gun

33:00.467 --> 33:02.399
and it hits its target,
it creates a spark.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.399
But we're gonna see
if we can create a spark

33:04.400 --> 33:06.866
without the help
of special effects.

33:06.867 --> 33:11.199
Narrator: So, first up,
kari goes into the light... Store

33:11.200 --> 33:13.699
for a little light learning.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.499
This is shawna. She's gonna
help me make a neon sign.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.499
Now, a neon light
is not that different
from a fluorescent tube.

33:19.500 --> 33:21.599
You ready?
Think so.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.432
A neon light uses high voltage

33:24.433 --> 33:26.832
to propel a current
through a tube

33:26.833 --> 33:30.132
that's filled with low-pressure
noble gases like neon,

33:30.133 --> 33:32.666
which gives us that
sort of orangeish-red glow.

33:32.667 --> 33:35.732
Different gases will give you
different colors of light.

33:35.733 --> 33:38.499
Oh, my god, i love this.
This is so cool.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.899
Narrator:
Yep, it's physics fireworks.

33:40.900 --> 33:44.132
High voltage causes electrons
to flow through the tube,

33:44.133 --> 33:46.832
bombarding the gas atoms.

33:46.833 --> 33:49.966
The resulting energy is given
off in the form of light,

33:49.967 --> 33:52.932
and the color, or wavelength,
of that light,

33:52.933 --> 33:55.066
is specific to the gas
in the tube.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.132
* ahh *

33:57.133 --> 33:58.532
it's gorgeous!

33:58.533 --> 34:02.066
And with her two themed
neon signs sealed,

34:02.067 --> 34:03.366
kari delivers them

34:03.367 --> 34:06.566
to a familiar
and warranty-voiding location...

34:06.567 --> 34:08.332
The gun range.

34:08.333 --> 34:10.332
Grant: So, we're back
at target masters west

34:10.333 --> 34:11.499
with a custom-made neon sign.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.066
Pink?
Yeah!

34:13.067 --> 34:14.732
Did you pick the color?
Of course i did!

34:14.733 --> 34:16.132
That's cute.

34:16.133 --> 34:19.066
We'll get a bunch of guns,
we're gonna shoot it, and see

34:19.067 --> 34:21.532
if doing so actually produces
spark and flame

34:21.533 --> 34:23.366
like it does in the movies.

34:23.367 --> 34:25.699
All right.
Are you guys ready for this?

34:25.700 --> 34:27.599
Neon sign versus 9mm handguns?

34:27.600 --> 34:29.800
Tory:
Let's see if it sparks.

34:31.167 --> 34:32.899
Kari: In three...

34:32.900 --> 34:34.499
Narrator: So, will the
combination of high voltage,

34:34.500 --> 34:35.899
vacuum-sealed neon gas,

34:35.900 --> 34:36.900
kari: Two...

34:36.901 --> 34:38.432
Narrator: And live ammo

34:38.433 --> 34:40.499
provide the spark
the myth requires?

34:40.500 --> 34:41.867
One.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.599
Narrator: Uh, no.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.166
Well, we hit it, but no sparks
like Hollywood.

34:48.167 --> 34:50.732
No. It was absolutely nothing
like the movies.

34:50.733 --> 34:52.799
A result...

34:52.800 --> 34:54.266
Shotgun!

34:54.267 --> 34:55.533
That's double-busted.

34:56.867 --> 34:58.699
It's for science.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.766
Narrator: When the guys
pull out the big guns...

35:00.767 --> 35:01.966
All right. We're hot!

35:01.967 --> 35:04.367
In three, two, one.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.866
Tory: Get some! Whoo!

35:07.867 --> 35:10.099
All right. It doesn't matter if
you have a shotgun or a pistol.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.100
You fire at a neon sign,

35:11.101 --> 35:12.466
you're not gonna get the sparks

35:12.467 --> 35:14.167
that you'd get
in a Hollywood movie.

35:18.633 --> 35:21.132
Narrator: Coming up
on "mythbusters"...

35:21.133 --> 35:24.766
If you can't stand the heat,
don't fry guns in the kitchen.

35:24.767 --> 35:26.200
Let's go eat some gun.

35:32.500 --> 35:36.499
Narrator: To give their neon
nightmare one last shot...

35:36.500 --> 35:39.766
We're gonna have to do something
a little more... Mythbustery.

35:39.767 --> 35:42.499
Narrator: Kari, Grant,
and Tory filled a new sign

35:42.500 --> 35:44.066
with highly flammable hydrogen

35:44.067 --> 35:47.699
and lit it with the worst
wiring job possible.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.866
[ Laughing ]

35:49.867 --> 35:52.832
That's right, I've created
several Jacob's ladders,

35:52.833 --> 35:55.366
which are just, basically,
traveling arcs.

35:55.367 --> 35:57.166
All right. We are hot!

35:57.167 --> 35:59.732
12,000 volts each.
There are three of them.

35:59.733 --> 36:01.832
In three...
36,000 volts.

36:01.833 --> 36:03.566
Two...

36:03.567 --> 36:07.066
If anything is going to ignite
that flammable gas...

36:07.067 --> 36:09.232
one.
This is it.

36:09.233 --> 36:10.732
Fire!

36:10.733 --> 36:13.066
Narrator: Despite the enriched
set of circumstances,

36:13.067 --> 36:16.166
not one single spark sparked.

36:16.167 --> 36:18.632
Grant: I know why they do it
this way in the movies,

36:18.633 --> 36:20.066
with all the sparks
and the flame...

36:20.067 --> 36:22.666
Because in real life,
it's boring!

36:22.667 --> 36:25.632
You shoot a tube,
and the tube just goes out.

36:25.633 --> 36:27.199
But you know what?
That's okay.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.066
Hollywood, you keep doing
what you do,

36:29.067 --> 36:30.700
and we'll keep busting
the myths.

36:36.167 --> 36:39.766
Narrator: For the final round
in the "bullet baloney" chamber

36:39.767 --> 36:43.466
comes a myth best served hot.

36:43.467 --> 36:45.432
Okay, we've got a story
about a guy

36:45.433 --> 36:46.699
running from the police

36:46.700 --> 36:47.799
through the back kitchen
of a restaurant,

36:47.800 --> 36:50.299
when he decides to ditch his gun

36:50.300 --> 36:51.366
into a hot deep fryer.

36:51.367 --> 36:53.366
Don't tell me.
It goes off.

36:53.367 --> 36:56.366
Exactly. I think we need to
deep-fry some guns to find out.

36:56.367 --> 36:58.066
Sounds tasty.

36:58.067 --> 37:01.666
For a not-so-lucky
fleeing fugitive,

37:01.667 --> 37:06.132
this fast-food firearm fable
was a high-calorie catastrophe.

37:06.133 --> 37:11.099
But Adam and Jamie want to know
if a gun firing in a fryer

37:11.100 --> 37:15.066
is a high-fat fact
or deep-fried fiction.

37:15.067 --> 37:19.099
To find out, they've hit the
bomb range for a fryer fight.

37:19.100 --> 37:21.399
Ready for
some deep-fried guns?

37:21.400 --> 37:23.232
You betcha.
I'm hungry.

37:23.233 --> 37:26.732
Adam: When you want to shoot
a gun in controlled conditions,

37:26.733 --> 37:31.466
as we've done countless times
on the show...

37:31.467 --> 37:33.266
In general,
you go to a shooting range.

37:33.267 --> 37:36.066
But when you want
to shoot off a gun

37:36.067 --> 37:38.266
in uncontrolled conditions,

37:38.267 --> 37:40.599
i.E., dropping one in a vat
of boiling oil...

37:40.600 --> 37:44.099
Well, then you want a place
that's a little more remote,

37:44.100 --> 37:45.832
and that's
why we've come to this,

37:45.833 --> 37:48.132
the yolo county bomb range
in Davis, California.

37:48.133 --> 37:51.232
They've got a shooting range
with very wide exclusion zone.

37:51.233 --> 37:54.066
That means we can conduct
our experiments safely here.

37:54.067 --> 37:55.699
Narrator:
And, as experiments go...

37:55.700 --> 37:56.966
That's good.

37:56.967 --> 37:58.766
Narrator: This one's
as simple as it gets...

37:58.767 --> 38:00.666
A deep fryer...

38:00.667 --> 38:03.666
Aww.
Isn't that pretty?

38:03.667 --> 38:06.899
Narrator: A 9mm handgun...

38:06.900 --> 38:08.399
Perfect!

38:08.400 --> 38:11.400
Narrator:
And soon-to-be-hot oil.

38:13.433 --> 38:15.499
Adam: So, the major components
of this experiment

38:15.500 --> 38:16.632
are pretty straightforward,

38:16.633 --> 38:17.932
and they're all
right in front of you.

38:17.933 --> 38:19.499
We've got a one-foot cube
made of steel

38:19.500 --> 38:21.799
that holds eight gallons
of canola oil,

38:21.800 --> 38:24.499
we've got a pistol mounted
solidly in a machine rest

38:24.500 --> 38:25.932
on a slider that allows us

38:25.933 --> 38:28.566
to safely and carefully lower it
down into the oil...

38:28.567 --> 38:30.699
Which will be heated up
to frying temperature

38:30.700 --> 38:32.232
with my propane torch.

38:32.233 --> 38:34.732
As everyone knows,
it's vital, when deep frying,

38:34.733 --> 38:36.932
to know the exact temperature
of your fry oil.

38:36.933 --> 38:39.132
And we will know that
using this thermocouple,

38:39.133 --> 38:41.499
whose wire travels
all the way back...

38:41.500 --> 38:43.299
Behind these blast shields,

38:43.300 --> 38:46.266
where we'll monitor everything
in perfect safety.

38:46.267 --> 38:47.866
How'd you get here so quick?

38:47.867 --> 38:49.899
Movie magic.
You ready?

38:49.900 --> 38:51.399
Yeah.
All right.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.199
Narrator: It's time to get
down to business,

38:53.200 --> 38:56.132
and the job at hand is cooking
a loaded gun

38:56.133 --> 38:58.466
to see if it will fire
in the fryer.

38:58.467 --> 39:00.532
Now, there are
many different temperatures

39:00.533 --> 39:02.899
that restaurants keep
their fry oil at,

39:02.900 --> 39:07.099
but at the top end, it's about
390, just shy of 400 degrees.

39:07.100 --> 39:09.499
So now we wait.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.367
That's hot oil.

39:10.368 --> 39:11.566
That's the temperature

39:11.567 --> 39:13.699
we're gonna be looking for
to drop our gun.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.766
Narrator:
And temperature is the key

39:15.767 --> 39:17.266
to the whole shooting match.

39:17.267 --> 39:20.532
Way back when the guys
baked bullets...

39:20.533 --> 39:24.432
Hot bullets!
Get your hot bullets here!

39:24.433 --> 39:26.399
They found the heat from an oven

39:26.400 --> 39:28.666
could get a gun
to go "bang."

39:28.667 --> 39:30.699
But now, the question is,

39:30.700 --> 39:34.232
will the wet oil dampen
that detonation?

39:34.233 --> 39:36.193
All right. That's 390.
I'm gonna shut off the gas.

39:38.300 --> 39:39.832
All right. The gun's free.
You ready to lower?

39:39.833 --> 39:42.299
Adam: I really feel strongly
that the moment

39:42.300 --> 39:44.766
we lower that gun in there,
it's gonna go "bang."

39:44.767 --> 39:47.099
All right.
Dropping a gun into hot oil.

39:47.100 --> 39:48.632
I don't think
it's gonna take much more

39:48.633 --> 39:50.699
than 10 or 15 seconds.

39:50.700 --> 39:53.199
Three, two, one.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.100
Jamie: There it goes.

39:54.101 --> 39:56.533
There it goes.

39:57.967 --> 40:00.166
Narrator:
And there it doesn't.

40:00.167 --> 40:02.832
The range
is most definitely hot.

40:02.833 --> 40:04.699
That heat's working its way
towards the bullet.

40:04.700 --> 40:09.099
But the gun
is clearly not fast food.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.232
I was thinking it would go
in the first 15 seconds.

40:11.233 --> 40:14.832
And, as 30 seconds rolls
into several minutes...

40:14.833 --> 40:16.899
Come on!
Do something!

40:16.900 --> 40:20.566
Confidence that the myth
will go off with a bang

40:20.567 --> 40:22.266
has cooled.

40:22.267 --> 40:23.999
You sure there's a bullet
in there, right?

40:24.000 --> 40:25.466
I'm sure there...

40:25.467 --> 40:27.332
Whoa!
There it is!

40:27.333 --> 40:29.732
[ Laughs ]

40:29.733 --> 40:31.766
Awesome!
That worked.

40:31.767 --> 40:35.466
Very well done.
Let's go eat some gun.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.099
Dinner is served...

40:37.100 --> 40:38.699
Whoa!

40:38.700 --> 40:43.299
Once again proving
that heat and ammunition

40:43.300 --> 40:45.699
are dangerous ingredients
in the kitchen.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.632
Adam: Well, i just hope
this goes to show you,

40:47.633 --> 40:49.932
kids who like to play it fast
and loose with the deep fryer,

40:49.933 --> 40:53.066
that this plus this
do not make for a tasty meal.

40:53.067 --> 40:54.766
Oh, no, you got to be careful

40:54.767 --> 40:57.199
when you bring guns
around the food processes,

40:57.200 --> 40:58.766
'cause you don't want to get
shot in the fish and chips,

40:58.767 --> 41:00.366
if you know what i mean.

41:00.367 --> 41:02.499
I'm not even sure what i mean.

41:02.500 --> 41:05.066
Narrator:
What Adam actually means is...

41:05.067 --> 41:08.099
The gun went off real sweet,
just like the myth.

41:08.100 --> 41:10.399
Narrator:
But they're not done yet.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.432
They're going again, and this
time, they're starting cold.

41:13.433 --> 41:15.466
So, our gun went off
in the vat of boiling oil,

41:15.467 --> 41:17.532
but that begs the question,

41:17.533 --> 41:21.266
what's the lower temperature
threshold for setting off a gun?

41:21.267 --> 41:22.766
So that's
what we're gonna figure out.

41:22.767 --> 41:24.632
We're gonna refill this tank
with some cold oil...

41:24.633 --> 41:27.666
Lowering it in.

41:27.667 --> 41:29.399
[ Laughs ]

41:29.400 --> 41:33.066
and heat that oil
until the gun goes off.

41:33.067 --> 41:34.933
That's all the information
at this point.

41:36.767 --> 41:38.732
So, what are we up to?

41:38.733 --> 41:41.132
Just over 160,
climbing steadily.

41:41.133 --> 41:43.532
You know, waiting for things
to go off like that,

41:43.533 --> 41:45.399
while you're heating them up
slowly,

41:45.400 --> 41:46.766
waiting for a failure point,

41:46.767 --> 41:48.899
is always nerve-racking.

41:48.900 --> 41:50.799
This is no exception.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.899
Jamie: Well, we're up
to about 260 degrees.

41:53.900 --> 41:55.232
Got a long ways to go.

41:55.233 --> 41:57.332
Adam: We're sitting there
passing the time

41:57.333 --> 41:59.466
as the temperature's
just climbing slowly.

41:59.467 --> 42:02.166
So, at the point
it's rounding 300,

42:02.167 --> 42:05.766
we're kind of feeling
a little bit bored and lax...

42:05.767 --> 42:07.232
So, what's your favorite
fried food?

42:07.233 --> 42:09.132
Fish and chips.

42:09.133 --> 42:10.133
Fish and chips?

42:10.134 --> 42:11.299
When they're done right.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.699
Not really paying
close attention,

42:13.700 --> 42:15.066
but just keeping tabs on it.

42:15.067 --> 42:18.066
Then, around 340,
we know that we're in the zone,

42:18.067 --> 42:20.699
and i literally was in the
middle of saying to Jamie...

42:20.700 --> 42:22.599
All right, i guess we'd better
start paying atten...

42:22.600 --> 42:24.366
Whoa!

42:24.367 --> 42:26.066
It totally just went.

42:26.067 --> 42:28.432
What temperature was it?

42:28.433 --> 42:30.466
It was right around 344 degrees.

42:30.467 --> 42:31.932
Whoa!

42:31.933 --> 42:34.366
This is a rare time
when the experiment happened

42:34.367 --> 42:38.066
long before we expected it
to happen.

42:38.067 --> 42:40.399
Wow. That's lower
than i thought it would be.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.066
Me too.

42:42.067 --> 42:44.067
It was surprising.

42:45.733 --> 42:49.166
Narrator: But with two
successful fryer firings,

42:49.167 --> 42:51.866
what's not surprising
is the result.

42:51.867 --> 42:54.432
So, i know this is
probably a little obvious,

42:54.433 --> 42:55.866
but it's time to call it.

42:55.867 --> 42:57.166
We don't need to call anything.

42:57.167 --> 42:58.399
Just drop that sign
on the ground,

42:58.400 --> 43:00.066
and the camera guy
will take care of the rest.

43:00.067 --> 43:01.067
All right.
Here we go.

43:03.733 --> 43:04.932
Why do we always park

43:04.933 --> 43:06.766
on the other side of the hill?

43:06.767 --> 43:08.399
I don't know.
It's stupid.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.632
And that's another fully-loaded,
gun-toting collection

43:11.633 --> 43:13.799
of clichés concluded.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.299
We shot a gun around a corner!

43:15.300 --> 43:17.599
Using their weapons
of mass deduction,

43:17.600 --> 43:19.232
their sums, and ammo...

43:19.233 --> 43:21.232
I'm speechless.
This is amazing.

43:21.233 --> 43:23.799
The team has once again defeated

43:23.800 --> 43:28.700
the dark forces
of fakery and fiction.
