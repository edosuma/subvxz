08:58.872 --> 09:00.331
hand-in-hand
with country music.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.044
I grew up in pickup trucks.
I grew up going to cookouts.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.588
I grew up just like you.
Oh, it's still going.
It's still going.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.048
I grew up
three hours south of you.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.924
But then you chose
not to do that.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.218
Okay, we're back!
No, I didn't choose --
I sang all those things.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.721
Why in the world does someone
have to limit -- You can't say,

09:14.763 --> 09:16.598
"You're not
a true country fan."

09:16.639 --> 09:20.018
Well, hey, I also
play NFL football.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.063

Right.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.023
What is happening?
I-I do a little quarterbacking
on the side,

09:25.065 --> 09:27.275
just because
why should I limit myself?
That's not the same!

09:27.317 --> 09:28.818
I mean, seriously.
That's not the same!

to say hi, really.
Hi.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.416
I thought you really
sounded great,

09:43.458 --> 09:45.752
and I really love the higher
part of your voice especially.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.962
It, like, popped,
and it was vibrant.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.132
I am so excited for you
to be on Team Kelly.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.686
so distinctly, iconically,
classically country.

So I am so excited
for Kelly.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.065
Yes!

You're gonna be such
a great addition to her team.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.277
It's gonna be amazing.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.529
Did it just happen

10:12.570 --> 10:14.739
that your voice lends itself
to country music,

10:14.781 --> 10:17.200
or were you born
loving country music?

10:17.242 --> 10:20.453
I did grow up with country music
and cookouts in Virginia,

10:20.495 --> 10:22.956
where I'm from,
they always had Blake Shelton,

10:22.997 --> 10:24.582

in the background.

My dad loves you,
by the way.

Sounds like a great guy.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.129
I sure do love ya!

10:29.170 --> 10:31.965
I sing a variety of music,
but country is my home base.

I don't dabble
in other things.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.885
Jesus, take the wheel.
Country is --

10:35.927 --> 10:39.431
Country is the only
thing I've really ever
been interested in doing.

I'm from Fort Wayne, Indiana.

Myself and all of my siblings
were adopted.

I have four other siblings,
so I'm one of five.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.920
We weren't able to
physically have a family,

14:38.962 --> 14:42.298
so it was great to take in kids
that needed homes.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.301
And we ended up being so blessed
and blown away

14:45.343 --> 14:47.554

that they brought to us.

My dad and his brothers,

14:49.764 --> 14:53.935
they play in a bluegrass band
called the Harness Family Band.

ethnicities and personalities.

Family goes beyond biology.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.952
Growing up, I did have
a slight sense of abandonment.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.246
It left a lot of room
for questions.

Who am I? Who am I
supposed to be? Where am I from?

15:15.999 --> 15:19.210
There were times where I would
yell out at my adoptive parents

15:19.252 --> 15:20.712
and be like,
"You don't understand me.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.214
I just want to be around
my biological, real mom."

15:23.256 --> 15:25.925

I said pretty often.

to reach out to my birth mom,

who spoke in a similar fashion
as I do,

15:42.859 --> 15:45.195
was extremely mind-boggling.

It gave me a sense
of understanding.

is something
that my son has taught me.

for my adoptive parents,

to their arms and say,

that you've done."

The blind is really
special to me,

with my own life.

missing somebody that you love.

from my 4-year-old son.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.491
My name's Samuel Harness.

18:36.533 --> 18:39.202
I'm 26 years old, and I'm from
Fort Wayne, Indiana.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.996
John: Fort Wayne.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.624
That was
absolutely phenomenal.

18:44.666 --> 18:48.545
You have such an incredible,
unique voice

18:48.586 --> 18:50.505
and such a grip on it.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.341
Wow. Thank you.
I loved the whole journey

18:53.383 --> 18:55.343
from the beginning to the end

18:55.385 --> 18:57.846
and hearing those amazing,
raspy high notes

18:57.887 --> 19:01.599
that were so grungy
but didn't sound unhealthy.

19:01.641 --> 19:05.520
It's a really hard thing to do
to have that much grit and soul,

19:05.562 --> 19:09.024
but also make it sound clean
and clear at the same time.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.859
Thank you so much.
Do you sing country, too?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.236
What kind of music do you
like to sing? Everything?
Oh, no.

19:13.278 --> 19:15.196
Not at all? Not at all?

19:15.238 --> 19:16.698
He said, "Oh, no."

19:16.740 --> 19:20.035
[ Laughing ] Oh, my God!
You have no chance.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.161
[ Laughter ]

19:21.202 --> 19:23.371
Why? I didn't
ask the question.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.290
He said a hard pass.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.667
So you're gonna have him sing
country music if he picks you?

19:27.709 --> 19:28.918
Is that what you're saying?
No.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.504
No, I was just checking.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.173
Oh, my God.
What do you love to sing?

19:33.214 --> 19:36.051
Influences would probably be
Bruno Mars, Lewis Capaldi,

19:36.092 --> 19:37.218
Ed Sheeran.
I heard Lewis.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.720
Yeah.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.722
You have that thing,
from the moment a song starts,

19:40.764 --> 19:42.849
I feel like I would
be able to tell that it's you.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.559
Thank you so much.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.979
It's interesting you pointed out
Lewis and Bruno and Ed,

19:48.021 --> 19:51.941
because the vibrato and the rasp
that you were working with

19:51.983 --> 19:56.071
was so unique and interesting
and signature for you.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.531
And sometimes, artists
that have so much rasp

19:58.573 --> 20:00.075
in their voice
don't have the range.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.410
I don't have the range to
execute what you're able to do,

20:02.452 --> 20:04.329
but I have the rasp,
and so I'm jealous.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.373
But [laughs]
Wow. Thank you.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.249
But it's a really powerful thing

20:08.291 --> 20:11.961
as an audience member to have
an artist emote like that.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.964
You will be a magical addition
to Team Legend.

20:15.006 --> 20:17.008
I would love to work with you.
Thank you so much.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.259
I appreciate that.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.220
[ Cheers and applause ]

20:20.261 --> 20:21.888
I think you have
such a cool voice.

20:21.930 --> 20:25.016
At the very end, when you had
that -- sustained that big note,

20:25.058 --> 20:27.894
that's when I feel like
your voice finally opened up.
Yeah.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.729
But it was like the end of the
song, and everybody'd already

20:29.771 --> 20:30.980
turned around, and I know
they're gonna be like,

20:31.022 --> 20:32.857
"I turned before you,"
so I didn't do it.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.818
But I-I love your voice.
I turned before all of them.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.611
Before all of them.
You did, you did.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.572
I'm so excited
to just watch Blake

20:39.614 --> 20:41.574
try and get you
on his team right now.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.660
[ Laughing ] His face!

20:43.702 --> 20:45.745
Well...

20:45.787 --> 20:49.958
since I have been kicked around
for the last five minutes,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.586
made fun of by Kelly
on national television

20:53.628 --> 20:55.213
and in front of you --
Awkward.

20:55.255 --> 20:57.382
Like he does
every time to me.

20:57.424 --> 21:00.844
I mean, it's unbelievable,
actually.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.012
You are so full of it.

21:02.053 --> 21:06.975
You know, it's true.
I am a country artist.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.477
Very good one.
But I'm not a country coach.

21:09.519 --> 21:10.979
I'm just a coach.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.731
Only 'cause you're not
a country artist right now.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.816
He says, "No, I am the country
coach," when a country artist

21:14.858 --> 21:16.359
stands there --
I just need to know that.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.987
I think it's important
to not be boxed in

21:19.029 --> 21:22.282
as an artist.
Oh, my God. The copy and paste.

21:22.323 --> 21:25.493
He just copy and pasted
what Kelly said 10 minutes ago!
What are you talking about?

21:25.535 --> 21:27.829
I like to dabble in other --
in other genres, too.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.205
Oh, my God!
He said dabble!

21:29.247 --> 21:32.083
Oh, my God! He said dabble.
So, listen, Samuel,

21:32.125 --> 21:34.002
I like to work with
all kinds of people,

21:34.044 --> 21:35.754
and voices like yours
are rare.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.631
It's like instead of a rasp,
it's like a sizzle,

21:38.673 --> 21:40.383
like a frying egg whenever
you get up there.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.968
Hey, there you go.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.720
I haven't heard that one yet.
And that's why I say

21:43.762 --> 21:45.513
it's not cool to try to box
people in and scare them.

21:45.555 --> 21:47.140
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

21:47.182 --> 21:49.684
So I would be honored
to be your coach, man.

21:49.726 --> 21:53.063
I'm the returning champ,
and I think we can do it again.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.522
Wow. That's huge.

21:54.564 --> 21:57.025
So, I guess
I'll ask you, Samuel.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.402
Um, who do you pick
as your coach?

21:59.444 --> 22:01.279
Obviously not Blake.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.406
John: Come on.
Come on, Samuel!

22:03.448 --> 22:06.159
Come on, Samuel.
Come home!

22:06.201 --> 22:08.370
Come on.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.497
Let's do this!
Come on, Samuel!

22:10.538 --> 22:12.332
You all have made
really good points,

22:12.374 --> 22:14.626
and you're all amazing artists.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.836
The person
I would like to work with...

22:24.594 --> 22:25.679
* This is "The Voice" *

22:25.720 --> 22:28.473
Daly: Welcome back.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.558
Kelly: I guess
I'll ask you, Samuel.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.268
Who do you pick
as your coach?

22:32.310 --> 22:33.895
Obviously not Blake.

22:33.937 --> 22:36.231
John: Come on.
Come on, Samuel!

22:37.857 --> 22:38.983
Come on.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.027
Let's do this!

really good points,

The person
I would like to work with...

22:48.159 --> 22:50.286
is John.
Yes!

22:50.328 --> 22:52.622
Whoo!

22:52.664 --> 22:55.208
Yes! I'm so happy.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.918
John: I love Samuel.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.587
What a powerful performer he is.

22:59.629 --> 23:02.507
And, whew, the emotion
that came from him,

23:02.549 --> 23:05.301
it just seemed so palpable.

23:05.343 --> 23:07.053
Kelly:
What happened, Blake?

23:07.095 --> 23:09.180
I don't know why Samuel
would want to go

23:09.222 --> 23:11.808
with a coach
that boxes people in.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.810
We got a little
boxing robe for you, too,

23:13.852 --> 23:15.478
'cause we want to go
win the belt.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.439
There you go.
Team Legend.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.649
You should have blocked him.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.192
Should have blocked him.

23:21.234 --> 23:25.405
Samuel is such an interesting,
unique, amazing singer.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.906
Alright!
Ariana: I really do wish

23:26.948 --> 23:29.492
that I had used my block there.

Yeah, I liked his voice, too.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.584
Yeah, he was cool.
Kelly derailed me on that one.

I did it on purpose,
and it felt good.

to save up enough money

23:52.766 --> 23:55.852
for pharmacy school.

23:55.894 --> 23:58.688
I am going to
the University of Nevada Reno,

23:58.730 --> 24:01.191
and I am studying biochemistry.

24:01.232 --> 24:03.026
It's very important
for my parents

24:03.068 --> 24:04.694
that I end up with a good job

24:04.736 --> 24:07.614
where the work is not
as physically exhausting

24:07.655 --> 24:09.491
as what they've had
to go through.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.826
Look, in Mexico, yeah.
Mexico.

24:18.249 --> 24:22.087
When we first got to Reno,
we lived in my uncle's garage.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.255
Me and my brother
had little bunk beds.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.175
And then right next to them
was my mom and dad's bed.

24:27.217 --> 24:29.552
I wouldn't bring friends over
because I was embarrassed

24:29.594 --> 24:31.096
I lived in a garage.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.973
My parents did work super hard
to give us a better life.

24:34.015 --> 24:37.394
My mom cleaned houses.
My dad's been doing landscaping.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.854
I regret not being as grateful
when I was younger.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.732
I think I definitely see it
more now that I'm older,

24:42.774 --> 24:46.361
and I really see
how hard they worked,

24:46.403 --> 24:48.071
and I'm very grateful.

24:48.113 --> 24:52.409
My parents now live in a house
that they bought themselves.

them, and they were very proud.

24:58.832 --> 25:01.501
When I entered kindergarten,
I only spoke Spanish.

I kind of kept to myself,
and my shyness just kind of

25:04.504 --> 25:07.090
continued throughout
middle school, high school.

25:07.132 --> 25:10.301
But my dad was always
in mariachi bands,

25:10.343 --> 25:13.054

"Oh, I want to sing, too."

29:00.990 --> 29:02.450
The second
you started singing,

29:02.492 --> 29:06.121
I was like, "This person
needs to be on Kelly's team."

29:06.162 --> 29:07.831
Maybe you can help her.

29:07.872 --> 29:09.749
I can.
I will definitely help you.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.167
The language barrier.

29:11.209 --> 29:12.961
I am obsessed
with your voice.

29:13.003 --> 29:15.130
I love when people come
out, and they can sing
in different languages.

29:15.171 --> 29:16.840
It's so important, I feel.

29:16.881 --> 29:18.258
And I love
connecting with people.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.176
And I just thought
your tone was, like,

29:20.218 --> 29:22.595
really present and round.
Thank you.

29:22.637 --> 29:24.514
I am the coach for you.

29:24.556 --> 29:25.515
Yes.

29:25.557 --> 29:27.851
Welcome to Team Kelly.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.644
[ Cheers and applause ]

29:29.686 --> 29:31.688
Kelly: I'm so happy that
I didn't have to fight for her,

29:31.730 --> 29:33.273
because I'm obsessed with her.

29:33.314 --> 29:35.525
She's such a great addition
to Team Kelly.

29:35.567 --> 29:36.735
She's fantastic.
Yeah.

29:36.776 --> 29:39.154
I got a little nervous
with the high belt.

29:39.195 --> 29:40.739
I do love her voice.

29:40.780 --> 29:45.368
I'm waiting for when people pick
their moments to show off

29:45.410 --> 29:49.372
and make it about the
emotional aspect of the song.

29:49.414 --> 29:51.291
Kelly: You knew I was gonna
turn for her.

29:51.332 --> 29:54.502
I can't resist it.
It's like Salma Hayek singing.

29:54.544 --> 29:56.588
It's the sexiest
damn language.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.757
Daly: As our coaches
start building their teams,

29:58.798 --> 30:00.216
start building yours.

30:00.258 --> 30:03.303
Get the "Voice" official app now
and play along.

30:09.434 --> 30:10.769
* This is "The Voice" *

30:10.810 --> 30:13.188
Daly: Welcome back
to the blind auditions.

30:13.229 --> 30:16.399
Man: <i>Here we go. 36 now. 36.</i>

30:16.441 --> 30:17.942
Chavon: For my blind audition,
I'll be singing

30:17.984 --> 30:20.612
"Driver's License"
by Olivia Rodrigo.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.322
John, I'm ready to fight you.
Alright.

30:22.364 --> 30:25.367
I'm kind of pop/alternative,

30:25.408 --> 30:28.912
so I think they're gonna hear
my own spin on the song,

30:28.953 --> 30:32.499
and hopefully they'll get to see
who I am as an artist.

30:34.709 --> 30:36.795
**

30:36.836 --> 30:40.215
* I got my driver's license
last week *

30:40.256 --> 30:43.551
* Just like we always
talked about *

30:43.593 --> 30:46.805
* 'Cause you were
so excited for me *

30:46.846 --> 30:50.141
* To finally drive up
to your house *

30:50.183 --> 30:53.311
* But today I drove
through the suburbs *

30:53.353 --> 30:58.775
* Crying 'cause
you weren't around *

30:59.526 --> 31:01.945
* I know we weren't perfect *

31:01.986 --> 31:08.034
* But I've never felt this way
for no one *

31:08.076 --> 31:15.792
* Oh, and I just can't imagine
how you could be so okay *

31:15.834 --> 31:19.379
* Now that I'm gone *

31:19.421 --> 31:21.089
* Cause you didn't mean *
Yes!

31:21.131 --> 31:26.052
* What you wrote
in that song about me *

31:26.094 --> 31:30.640
* You said forever, now I drive
alone past your street *

31:32.434 --> 31:36.062
* Ohh, red lights, stop signs *

31:36.104 --> 31:42.819
* I still see your face
in the white cars, front yards *

31:42.861 --> 31:49.534
* Can't drive past the places
we used to go to *

31:49.576 --> 31:54.372
* You know I still love you,
baby *

31:54.414 --> 31:57.917
* Ahhhh, wooo *

31:57.959 --> 31:59.544
Ariana!

31:59.586 --> 32:03.882
* 'Cause you said forever,
now I drive alone *

32:03.923 --> 32:07.135
* Past your street *

32:07.177 --> 32:08.470
Yes.

32:08.511 --> 32:11.806
[ Cheers and applause ]

32:11.848 --> 32:13.391
Oh, my God.

32:15.477 --> 32:17.437
Whoo!

32:17.479 --> 32:18.563
Yeah!

32:18.605 --> 32:20.023
That was great.
What's your name?

32:20.065 --> 32:22.192
Where are you from?
I'm gonna pass out. One second.

32:22.233 --> 32:23.943
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my God.

32:23.985 --> 32:25.528
[ Laughter ]

32:25.570 --> 32:28.448
My name is Chavon Rodgers.
I'm 23 years old.

32:28.490 --> 32:30.950
I currently live
in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.535
Wow.
But I'm originally from

32:32.577 --> 32:35.080
a little place you might know,
Blake -- Ada, Oklahoma.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.915
John: Oh, wow.
What?

32:36.956 --> 32:38.500
You're kidding me.

32:38.541 --> 32:41.252
Chavon: There's really not
a whole lot to say about Ada.

32:41.294 --> 32:43.004
[ Laughs ]
It's a small place.

32:43.046 --> 32:46.091
Blake is definitely the biggest
thing to come out of Ada.

32:46.132 --> 32:49.302
I come from a very big family.
I have seven siblings.

32:49.344 --> 32:52.347
My parents gave us
all "C" names -- Checed,

32:52.389 --> 32:54.933
Carissa, Christopher, Caleb, Me,

32:54.974 --> 32:56.768
Corbin, Creed, Cruz.

32:56.810 --> 32:58.436
[ Laughs ]

32:58.478 --> 33:00.355
Me and all of my older siblings,

33:00.397 --> 33:02.732
we sang together
and played music together.

33:02.774 --> 33:06.319
Once I graduated from high
school, we moved to Tulsa.

33:06.361 --> 33:08.446
I started going to school
for physical therapy,

33:08.488 --> 33:10.907
and about a year or two
into that

33:10.949 --> 33:12.826
is when I met my wife at church.

33:12.867 --> 33:15.120
* I'm running wide open *

33:15.161 --> 33:17.288
She's incredible.
* I was born
with my feet in motion *

33:17.330 --> 33:18.790
Are you excited
about "The Voice"?

33:18.832 --> 33:19.874
I am excited.

33:19.916 --> 33:23.378
My wife has been
my number-one supporter.

33:23.420 --> 33:26.464
I'm glad that I'm
forcing you to do it.

33:26.506 --> 33:29.009
I've always wanted
to have a career in music,

33:29.050 --> 33:32.053
but I didn't think that was
a realistic goal to set.

33:32.095 --> 33:35.348
And my wife said, "You
don't need to be doing
physical therapy.

33:35.390 --> 33:36.975
You need to be doing music,"

33:37.017 --> 33:38.435
and has given me

33:38.476 --> 33:42.105
a tremendous amount
of validation and encouragement.

33:42.147 --> 33:45.150
I would not be pursuing music
if it wasn't for her.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.527
I actually brought
something for you.

33:47.569 --> 33:49.612
Blake, I think you should have
turned around for Chavon.
Is it something
authentically country?

33:49.654 --> 33:52.532
Hey, wait a minute. This isn't
one of those DNA tests, is it?

33:52.574 --> 33:55.160
It's a DNA test. Yeah.
[ Laughter ]

33:55.201 --> 33:56.453
Oh, God.

33:56.494 --> 33:58.329
You are the father!

33:58.371 --> 33:59.831
I knew it.

33:59.873 --> 34:01.833
[ Laughter ]

34:01.875 --> 34:05.378
So, this is, like,
an early 1900s Ada brick.

34:05.420 --> 34:06.755
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:06.796 --> 34:08.840
My family kept them
throughout the years,

34:08.882 --> 34:10.592
and I'm sure you've seen them
lying around.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:10.633 --> 34:11.843
So I just wanted you
to have a little piece of home.

34:11.885 --> 34:14.179
You're giving me that?
Oh, yeah.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.847
That's really cool.

34:15.889 --> 34:16.931
Hey, man, thank you.

34:16.973 --> 34:18.350
John: That is cool.
Thank you, man.

34:18.391 --> 34:20.018
Honor to meet you.
Honor to meet you.

34:20.060 --> 34:22.270
You know, when people
come with special gifts,

34:22.312 --> 34:25.398
his instinct is never to push
this button for these people.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.150
That does happen.
Then they're like, "Well, Blake,

34:27.192 --> 34:28.443
I'm the biggest fan of yours.

34:28.485 --> 34:30.195
I wrote a whole
presentation about you

34:30.236 --> 34:31.571
when I was 12 years old."

34:31.613 --> 34:32.822
I couldn't help
but notice

34:32.864 --> 34:34.199
you said you're
from his hometown.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.326
So you know pop music.
Absolutely.

34:36.368 --> 34:38.036
Wow.
It's an inside joke.

34:38.078 --> 34:40.914
No, it's not. I've recorded pop
music with Christina Aguilera.

34:40.955 --> 34:43.083
I love to paint
outside the lines.
Oh, my God.

34:43.124 --> 34:44.876
Oh, my God!
I dabble in all kinds of music.

34:44.918 --> 34:47.212
These two cannot stop
fighting each other

34:47.253 --> 34:49.631
or involving you.
This...has nothing to do

34:49.673 --> 34:51.508
with you guys right now.
Yes, exactly.

34:51.549 --> 34:54.427
Exactly.
Let us have our moment!

34:54.469 --> 34:57.138
I loved the journey
of that performance.

34:57.180 --> 34:59.391
I loved the sweetness, the
quietness in the beginning.

34:59.432 --> 35:00.934
It sounded emotional.

35:00.975 --> 35:03.603
You had the softer storytelling
part, and then you had

35:03.645 --> 35:05.730
this extraordinary ending,
and it grew.

35:05.772 --> 35:08.900
I like when there's an arc.
I loved your interpretation.

35:08.942 --> 35:10.735
Were you a little bit nervous?
Absolutely.

35:10.777 --> 35:13.029
It almost deterred me
from hitting my button.

35:13.071 --> 35:15.240
But as I listened,
I loved getting to know

35:15.281 --> 35:16.449
the other parts
of your voice.

35:16.491 --> 35:19.619
You have an amazing
high falsetto,

35:19.661 --> 35:22.247
and you had these controlled
louder, stronger runs.

35:22.288 --> 35:26.543
And I was thinking about how fun
it would be to work together

35:26.584 --> 35:29.754
and get comfortable
with this amazing band

35:29.796 --> 35:31.798
and in this space
and on a stage like this.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.217
And I hope we get
to work together.

35:34.259 --> 35:35.510
Thank you so much.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.929
[ Cheers and applause ]

35:37.971 --> 35:41.099
One of my soft spots
as a listener

35:41.141 --> 35:43.435
is for that kind of Jeff Buckley
kind of tone.

35:43.476 --> 35:45.437
Ooh.
It was inviting.

35:45.478 --> 35:47.105
Mm-hmm.
It was interesting.

35:47.147 --> 35:48.940
It was mysterious in a way.

35:48.982 --> 35:50.567
Oh, mysterious.
And then it built

35:50.608 --> 35:54.029
till just amazing heights.
He's laying it on thick.

35:54.070 --> 35:55.238
What are you into musically?

35:55.280 --> 35:57.449
OneRepublic, Shawn Mendes.
Yeah.

35:57.490 --> 35:59.617
I love working with Ryan
from OneRepublic.

35:59.659 --> 36:01.870
He's worked with me on my
last album, my current album.

36:01.911 --> 36:04.998
I've worked with Ryan,
as well, so...
Yes, he's fantastic.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.291
Same.
He's fantastic.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.585
We go way back.
Way back.

36:08.626 --> 36:10.962
Obviously, the song
is everywhere right now, and --

36:11.004 --> 36:12.797
and what I loved
about your version,

36:12.839 --> 36:16.092
you took it to different places
that felt like your own

36:16.134 --> 36:17.469
and was really powerful.

36:17.510 --> 36:19.304
I would love
to coach you, Chavon.

36:19.346 --> 36:20.680
Thank you so much.

36:20.722 --> 36:22.766
[ Cheers and applause ]

36:22.807 --> 36:25.643
See how civilized we are?
[ Laughs ]

36:25.685 --> 36:27.771
I just want
to point that out.

36:27.812 --> 36:30.357
I read it
as not as much passion.

36:30.398 --> 36:32.108
That's what
I read it as.

36:32.150 --> 36:34.069
Anyway --
I'm not very happy

36:34.110 --> 36:35.487
with either one
of these two right now,

36:35.528 --> 36:36.988
so I'm not gonna
help you there.

36:37.030 --> 36:38.490
I wish you had another option,
to be honest with you.

36:38.531 --> 36:39.699
Yeah, you shouldn't have
given him a brick.

36:39.741 --> 36:41.576
Oh, my God.
So -- So good luck.

36:41.618 --> 36:43.661
Chavon, who do you pick
as your coach?

36:43.703 --> 36:47.665
[ Cheers and applause ]

36:47.707 --> 36:50.168
Oh.
Come on home, Chavon!

36:50.210 --> 36:51.503
Come on.

36:51.544 --> 36:54.506
Thank you so much, John.
You're incredible.

36:54.547 --> 36:55.590
Thank you.

36:55.632 --> 36:57.342
I choose Ariana.
Oh!

36:57.384 --> 36:59.594
* One last time *

36:59.636 --> 37:02.972
* I need to be the one
who takes you home *

37:03.014 --> 37:04.724
Oh, my goodness.

37:04.766 --> 37:07.394
I have to give you
your vocal health first aid kit.

37:07.435 --> 37:08.645
For me?

37:08.687 --> 37:10.105
Welcome! Thank you!

37:10.146 --> 37:13.358
Chavon -- I'm so happy
to have him on my team.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.069
Covering a song
that is as big as

37:16.111 --> 37:19.656
and as good as "Driver's
License" is a tall order.

37:19.698 --> 37:23.368
To have a vision of it
that is individual enough

37:23.410 --> 37:28.373
to refresh our experience with
the song is a very hard thing.

37:28.415 --> 37:32.043
It feels so good
to beat John Legend.

37:32.085 --> 37:33.837
I feel like I'm getting better
at my pitching.

37:33.878 --> 37:35.422
Why'd you pick Ariana
over John?

37:35.463 --> 37:37.257
She's just a little bit
more up my alley.
Yeah.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.926
And so I feel like I have a lot
that I can learn from her.

37:39.968 --> 37:42.220
Blake, do you need me
to hold that brick for you?

37:42.262 --> 37:45.974
I'll just hold it,
until I release it...

37:46.016 --> 37:47.809
in your face.

to the blind auditions

37:56.484 --> 37:57.694
at Universal Studios Hollywood.

37:57.736 --> 37:59.362
Ari and I have not
used our blocks yet.

37:59.404 --> 38:01.656
We still have our blocks. I'm
waiting for the right moment.

38:01.698 --> 38:03.700
I know it'll come.
I'm waiting till I'm inspired.

38:03.742 --> 38:05.493
I don't know who I'm going
to use it on now, though,

38:05.535 --> 38:06.995
because everybody's
doing so well.

38:07.037 --> 38:09.622
And who do I want
to sabotage more?

38:09.664 --> 38:11.124
I think
I still have mine, too.

38:11.166 --> 38:13.710
Yeah, I don't think you do.
I don't think that was me.

38:13.752 --> 38:15.587
I'm pretty certain
you got Wendy that way.

38:15.628 --> 38:16.755
My elbow may have hit it.

To be honest with you,

you're at the point

41:28.488 --> 41:31.116
where you're good enough
to have gotten onto the show

made it that far in,

even when it's hard
to understand them.

57:30.116 --> 57:33.411
And that brought forth
extreme sadness

57:33.453 --> 57:36.122
at not having understood

57:36.164 --> 57:39.209
what he had been
going through for years.

57:39.250 --> 57:43.963
The only way to feel like me
was to transition to male.

57:44.005 --> 57:46.591
I dealt with a lot
of hateful comments,

57:46.633 --> 57:50.387
whether it was from my
classmates or from teachers.

57:50.428 --> 57:53.807
I wouldn't have been able
to get through high school

57:53.848 --> 57:56.017
without music
and without art

57:56.059 --> 57:58.228

what I was going through.

57:58.269 --> 58:01.356
Sasha was always
very strong.

58:01.398 --> 58:03.608
And for parents,
you think that your kids

58:03.650 --> 58:06.486
are gonna grow
from your influence on <i>them,</i>

58:06.528 --> 58:09.489
but, quite frankly, a lot
of times, it's the opposite,

58:09.531 --> 58:11.950
and they expand
<i>our</i>horizons more.

58:11.991 --> 58:14.828
While it is such a-a big
and extraordinary thing

58:14.869 --> 58:16.830
to absorb,
there are fundamental things

58:16.871 --> 58:19.124
that don't change
about a person.

58:19.165 --> 58:22.794
And, uh, it's -- it's nice
to -- to be at that point

58:22.836 --> 58:25.505

it's not a big deal.

to do this with each other.

they had me sing for

Starting a business completely
on your own is terrifying.

But if you're taking care
of children, you got to hustle.

the best day of my life.

through your obstacles,

She was the inspiration
of me being an artist.

1:23:43.148 --> 1:23:44.649
...my gosh!

1:23:44.691 --> 1:23:46.151
What a get!

1:23:46.192 --> 1:23:48.278
What just happened?!
* You're my starlight *

1:23:48.319 --> 1:23:50.613
Kelly: No one, including me,
saw that happening.

1:23:50.655 --> 1:23:52.699
What?!
Ariana is a threat,

1:23:52.741 --> 1:23:55.118
so I'm gonna take this victory.

1:23:55.160 --> 1:23:56.703
And maybe do a dance.

1:23:56.745 --> 1:23:58.913
I am so excited!

1:23:58.955 --> 1:24:01.791
What happened?
She sang <i>your</i>song!

1:24:01.833 --> 1:24:05.003
Ariana: I am happy that Gymani
ended up picking Kelly,

1:24:05.045 --> 1:24:07.088
although
she should have picked me.

1:24:07.130 --> 1:24:09.174
Anything can happen
around here,

1:24:09.215 --> 1:24:12.677
I'm learning quite quickly,
as I'm wounded from every angle.

1:24:12.719 --> 1:24:16.014
Ayy!
Oh, man!

1:24:16.056 --> 1:24:19.726
She let --
She let Kelly lie.
This is a lie.

1:24:19.768 --> 1:24:22.437
'Cause she wouldn't
stand up to Kelly.

1:24:22.479 --> 1:24:23.688
And now you lost Gymani.

1:24:23.730 --> 1:24:25.190
I didn't have a chance.

1:24:25.231 --> 1:24:26.733
She sang your song.

1:24:26.775 --> 1:24:29.277
Do you see how hard it is to
get a word in around here?

1:24:29.319 --> 1:24:31.363
No one ever shuts up!

1:24:31.404 --> 1:24:32.781
* Come on, dance with me *

1:24:32.822 --> 1:24:34.491
Aah!
* I'm levitating *

1:24:34.532 --> 1:24:44.334
**

1:24:44.376 --> 1:24:54.177
**

1:24:54.219 --> 1:25:04.020
**
