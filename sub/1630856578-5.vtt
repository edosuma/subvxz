WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.960
GROANING,
STRAINING

00:03.960 --> 00:06.000
Dad?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.160
Dad?

00:08.160 --> 00:09.960
Ben Tyldesley.
No way.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.960
Ben Tyldesley!
No way!

00:11.960 --> 00:13.960
Get in!
HE LAUGHS

00:13.960 --> 00:16.960
How could I forget the name
of the first boy

00:16.960 --> 00:19.000
lucky enough to kiss my little girl?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.160
HE CHUCKLES
Good old Ben Tyldesley.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.960
HE COUGHS
Bloody hell!

00:26.960 --> 00:28.960
Aimee, that's strong stuff,
that, innit?

00:28.960 --> 00:30.960
Oh!

00:30.960 --> 00:32.960
It's making my eyes go all blurry.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.960
Are yours?

00:34.960 --> 00:35.960
A bit, yeah.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.960
But it says online it helps.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.960
Have you been using your cane?
Yeah. Yeah.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.960
It's been really helping me out,
that, love. Nice one.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.960
Really?
Yeah. Here y'are, look...

00:51.960 --> 00:55.320
When I wanna roll a spliff,
I don't have to get up now.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.960
HE LAUGHS
Think you're funny, do you?

00:57.960 --> 00:59.480
I do, yeah.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.960
Look, seriously, though, you need
to get back to school today.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.960
You've been off for two weeks.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.960
OK? I don't need you here
looking after me. I'm fine.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.160
Right, I'm going for a number two.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.960
Argh!
What? What?

01:11.960 --> 01:14.480
Are you OK?
Oh, eh, ooh!

01:14.480 --> 01:16.960
HE LAUGHS
Fuck off!

01:16.960 --> 01:18.960
I'm sorry, love.
Tit.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.320
Look at his hair.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.960
Look at the way his chin
kinda points upwards.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.000
Look at the way he desperately wants
to hire a gardener.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.960
BOYS LAUGH

01:41.960 --> 01:43.960
Look at the way his face
is telling me he owns a painting

01:43.960 --> 01:45.800
of his great-great-grandad.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.960
THEY LAUGH

01:47.960 --> 01:50.960
Lad, I'm only messing, lad.
You seem all right for a posh boy.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.320
You seem all right
for Reece's cousin.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.960
I thought you were gonna turn up

01:53.960 --> 01:55.960
with six Primark bags
and three kids.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.960
My missus
doesn't let me see me the kids

01:57.960 --> 01:59.960
since I got caught robbing
from Primark.

01:59.960 --> 02:00.960
Ooh.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.800
Lad!
Shouldn't have said that.

02:03.800 --> 02:04.960
I'm having you on, you div!

02:04.960 --> 02:08.000
THEY LAUGH
Had you going there, lad.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.960
Yeah, don't worry, sis.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.000
He's gonna be fine here with me
for the week, yeah.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.960
I'll make sure
he stays out of trouble. Exactly.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.960
Best to get him away
from those bad-influence,

02:18.960 --> 02:24.160
scumbag, thieving, feral, awful,
dirty mates of his, yeah.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.960
Yeah, yeah. No.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.960
We all know he wouldn't have stolen
it if it wasn't for them.

02:27.960 --> 02:31.960
Get on this, lads. When I was
on my own before, I took these.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.960
I was coming back from the shop,
and there was a delivery van,

02:34.960 --> 02:36.960
and when the fella took a parcel
into the house,

02:36.960 --> 02:37.960
I jumped into the back
and nabbed 'em.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.960
You can always tell which ones
are the new iPhones

02:40.960 --> 02:45.960
because they come in a box
that's rectangle... like an iPhone.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.960
Your lucky day, lads!

02:47.960 --> 02:50.960
Santa, me!
I haven't got one for you, mate,

02:50.960 --> 02:52.480
but you've probably got one,
haven't you?

02:52.480 --> 02:55.000
I actually don't, cos I employ
"ye ma" to text for me.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.480
THEY LAUGH

02:58.480 --> 03:00.960
Hey, is that my jacket?
I didn't bring a jacket.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.960
What, you want me
to freeze my tits off?

03:02.960 --> 03:05.960
No, don't worry.
I won't say a word to my mum.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.960
She knows exactly how important
your reputation is to your career.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.960
And our Reece, yeah.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.960
No, he won't say a word, even though
he can be a right blabbermouth.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.960
OK, honey, all right.
Love you, bye!

03:19.960 --> 03:23.960
Mum, are you sitting down?
Cos you're not gonna believe this.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.960
Our Tyreece,
he's been caught shoplifting again!

03:26.960 --> 03:28.960
Yes, I know, Mum, it's shocking!

03:28.960 --> 03:31.960
He's on his final warning, mm-hm.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.960
It's Steph's fault. She's completely
lost control of him.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.320
She's lost the dressing room, Mum!

03:38.960 --> 03:41.960
Hey! One and you're through!

03:41.960 --> 03:44.960
For any newcomers,
here's the rules...

03:44.960 --> 03:45.960
There are no rules.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.960
Argh! Argh!

03:51.960 --> 03:53.320
Bit hard that, Pat.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.960
Brexit means Brexit, Connor.

03:59.960 --> 04:03.640
'It's making
my eyes go all blurry. Are yours?'

04:04.960 --> 04:05.960
There she is now!

04:05.960 --> 04:07.960
She's got...
She's bonkers...

04:07.960 --> 04:09.960
She got no shame?

04:10.960 --> 04:12.960
Yo!
She defo posted them TikToks.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.960
She's been off for, like, two weeks.
Rat, her, like.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.960
Wrong 'un.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.960
Liar!
I'd have just switched country, me.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.800
You heard what she said about my ma?
I'd be mortified if I was her.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.960
Snake!
Rat! Bang out of order.

04:25.960 --> 04:29.960
Thus bescreened in night,
so stumblest upon my counsel?

04:29.960 --> 04:32.960
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.960
SLOW CLAPPING

04:35.960 --> 04:37.160
Splendid, Grace, darling.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.960
You used so many techniques
all in one line.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.960
Although you forgot the technique

04:42.960 --> 04:44.960
where you bend over and stick
your head up your own arse.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.160
LAUGHTER

04:46.160 --> 04:49.640
Christopher, I love the choice
you've made to play Romeo

04:49.640 --> 04:50.960
like a gormless prick.

04:50.960 --> 04:54.960
That's right, I'm back, bitches.
The Juliet OG.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.000
The big dog's back.
I'm really glad you're back, Aimee.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.960
It takes a lot of courage to return
after what you did. Yeah.

05:01.960 --> 05:05.960
Off you pop, pouty.
Let me show you how Juliet's done.

05:06.960 --> 05:07.960
Go 'ead, girl!

05:09.960 --> 05:12.960
Art thou not, Romeo, a Montague

05:12.960 --> 05:15.960
and the coward who believeth
that I would be'est so horrible

05:15.960 --> 05:17.640
as to posteth a TikTok video

05:17.640 --> 05:18.960
slagging off everyone
in this school?

05:18.960 --> 05:20.960
That's not...
Can we just do the scene?

05:20.960 --> 05:22.960
But it shalt be true,
so don't tryeth deny it! Aimee!

05:22.960 --> 05:27.960
Aimee! Whilst you've been away,
everyone's been working really hard.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.960
I need to know your head's
in the right place.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.960
Er, that's discrimination,
that, sir.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.960
She's clearly got
some kind of mental health issues.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.960
Do you not believe
in mental health, sir?

05:36.960 --> 05:39.960
Love creating mental health stigma,
do you, sir?

05:39.960 --> 05:41.800
Can't see it so doesn't exist, sir?

05:41.800 --> 05:42.960
Your dad told you to man up

05:42.960 --> 05:44.960
so you've suppressed your emotions
all your life, sir?

05:44.960 --> 05:46.960
You wanna lock her in an asylum
like it's the 1950s

05:46.960 --> 05:48.960
instead of helping her, sir?
No!

05:48.960 --> 05:50.160
STIFLED LAUGHTER

05:50.160 --> 05:52.960
Done a course.
Oh, you had to do a course?

05:52.960 --> 05:55.800
Because of your 1950s attitude, sir?

05:55.800 --> 06:00.960
No! Just... Just try
to get better quickly, please.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.960
But also in your own time.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.960
Your recovery is the most important
thing, so... Hm.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.960
But also, it is opening night
on Wednesday, so...

06:16.320 --> 06:17.480
Hey!

06:17.480 --> 06:19.960
Are you actually all right,
though, girl? I'm fine.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.960
Where is it?
Your self-respect?

06:24.960 --> 06:26.960
It's long gone, that, lad.
My mum's wedding ring!

06:26.960 --> 06:28.960
I still find it mad
that she was from Liverpool

06:28.960 --> 06:30.960
but managed to produce
such a floppy-haired, posh meff.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.960
Nobody else has been in my room!
I know you're frustrated, lad,

06:33.960 --> 06:35.000
but you might get a bird in there
one day.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.960
You were the only person
that knew where I kept it!

06:37.960 --> 06:39.960
Maybe Pat knew?

06:39.960 --> 06:42.480
Don't rule her out,
she's desperate for cash.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.960
She offered herself sexually to me.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.960
We couldn't agree on a price,
though,

06:45.960 --> 06:48.320
cos, you see,
I wanted a kiss on the lips,

06:48.320 --> 06:49.960
but she was worried
such a degree of intimacy

06:49.960 --> 06:51.960
might turn us into a relationship.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.960
It's not funny! You know how much
that ring means to me.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.480
Oh, my God!
Is that what you think of me?

06:57.480 --> 06:58.960
What do you want me to think
when you do this?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.960
I stuck my neck on the line for you.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.160
Do you think anyone
would have been mates

07:02.160 --> 07:04.960
with such a posh prick without me?
Oh, thank you so much, Reece!

07:04.960 --> 07:07.960
Oh, here, take my watch, too,
as long as we can still be mates!

07:07.960 --> 07:09.960
I could never be mates
with someone like you.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.640
It was never gonna work, lad.
Like Vardys and Rooneys.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.960
Scousers and Mancs.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.960
Normal lads
and posh helmets like you!

07:21.960 --> 07:23.960
Get on the other side of the road,
you muppet!

07:34.960 --> 07:36.960
I'm a bellend.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.160
Don't you mean
"I'm a complete bellend"?

07:41.960 --> 07:42.960
Aimee.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.160
Morris.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.960
What will she do?

07:46.960 --> 07:49.480
Worry about
what the dickheads think of her?

07:49.480 --> 07:52.960
Or show them the amazing actress
she really is?

07:52.960 --> 07:56.160
Will there be dirty looks
from those watching?

07:56.160 --> 07:57.960
Probably.

07:57.960 --> 08:02.000
Or will she give
a stunning performance?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.960
Definitely.
SHE CHUCKLES

08:04.960 --> 08:07.960
Oh, Aims, I always know
when you're not all right.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.960
We know the truth, so who cares
what everyone else thinks?

08:10.960 --> 08:13.640
Don't hide. Just do this for you.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.960
Or option two,
I'll just make a TikTok video

08:15.960 --> 08:19.000
slagging everyone off,
and I will destroy lives.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.960
Takes the heat off you, innit?
I think I'll stick with option one.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.480
OK, but option two's always there
if you do change your mind, girl.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.960
THEY CHUCKLE

08:27.960 --> 08:29.960
I'm passing the phone to the boy

08:29.960 --> 08:31.960
who's the face
of the Stop The Boats campaign.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.960
I'm passing the phone
to the lad who's so posh,

08:33.960 --> 08:36.960
he thinks he has to apologise
for British colonisation.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.000
I am so sorry
for my ancestors' behaviour.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.960
I'm passing the phone
to the lad who, unlike me,

08:42.960 --> 08:46.640
can't tell the difference between
a dessert spoon or a teaspoon.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.960
I'm passing the phone
to the lad who, when he was 12,

08:49.960 --> 08:52.480
got caught by his auntie
wanking to Jasmine off Aladdin.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.960
THEY LAUGH
What's funny?

08:54.960 --> 08:56.960
# A whole new world!

08:56.960 --> 09:00.960
♪ A new fantastic point of view! ♪

09:00.960 --> 09:01.960
THEY LAUGH

09:01.960 --> 09:04.800
Nah, Tyreece got us doing
the pass-the-phone challenge.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.960
Oh, sound. Let's go again.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.960
I pass the phone...
We're finished with that now, lad.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.800
Yeah.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.960
I've gotta go for my tea anyway.
Lad, you are sick!

09:12.960 --> 09:15.960
THEY LAUGH

09:15.960 --> 09:17.800
Ah!
Come on, Ted.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.000
Can I come yours, Ted?
See you in a bit, lad.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.320
Oh, nice one, man.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.160
I'll see you in a bit, lad, yeah?
Sound, yeah.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.480
They new webs, lad?

09:26.480 --> 09:29.960
Yeah, I treated myself. I've endured
a very stressful time recently.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.960
Haven't you just been
on a skiing trip?

09:31.960 --> 09:33.960
Two-hour delay on the way back, lad.

09:36.960 --> 09:37.960
Is that a new jacket?

09:37.960 --> 09:40.960
What, you like it? It's like yours
but a better version.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.960
You took his ring, didn't you?
What did you do, pawn it?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.320
It was worth 500 quid! Buzzing.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.160
Lad, it was his mum's ring.
She died.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.960
Well, that's bang on,
that is, innit,

09:51.960 --> 09:53.960
but a ring's
not gonna bring her back.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.960
Didn't you used to wear Grandad's
ring when he died? Yeah, used to.

09:56.960 --> 09:57.960
I sold it for 50 quid.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.960
Acceptance, mate.
One of the stages of grief.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.640
Well, lad, he thinks it was me.
So we're taking your stuff back.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.960
Nah, are we fuck! I'm well within
my rights to have all this stuff.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.960
He probably gets new clobber
every week.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.960
He's not as rich as you think he is.
Why do you think he's here?

10:10.960 --> 10:13.640
Yeah, well, he defo thinks
he's better than us. No, he doesn't.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.960
Are you two bezzies or something?

10:15.960 --> 10:18.960
Oh! I thought I seen you two
giving each other the eyes,

10:18.960 --> 10:19.960
the pre-bum eyes.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.960
Are you mad? You're on a caution.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.960
Aw. Reckon he's gonna make you
wear a condom tonight now, lad?

10:24.960 --> 10:26.960
Lad, I'm being serious!

10:26.960 --> 10:29.960
Look, are we just gonna sit back
and let the rich get richer? "We"?

10:29.960 --> 10:31.480
Isn't your ma
some marketing manager?

10:31.480 --> 10:32.960
Deputy marketing manager!

10:32.960 --> 10:34.800
And what are you
bringing that up for?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.160
You know she was in bits
when she didn't get it.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.960
How much is left?
About 250.

10:38.960 --> 10:43.000
But I was planning
a little a la carte dining session

10:43.000 --> 10:45.960
at Bella Italia, on me,
if you want, lad?

10:45.960 --> 10:47.960
Nah. You're giving it to me.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.960
Cos then I've gotta find another
250 quid to buy it back for him.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.960
Yeah. You probably need
a bit more on top of that, like.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.960
It's how the pawn shop
makes their money.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.960
Yeah, I know, lad.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.800
Hey, Mum.
Jesus wept.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.960
Any chance I could borrow 300 quid?
Oh, yeah!

Hey... did you just hear that?

13:39.480 --> 13:41.800
The gimp who hacked Aimee's TikTok

13:41.800 --> 13:43.960
called Lucy Gill
a drunkard in the video. So?

13:43.960 --> 13:46.960
Well, not many people in this school
would use that word, love.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.960
They'd just say,
"Pisshead, her, like."

13:49.960 --> 13:51.960
Hey... Grace.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.480

it looks like you're right, girl.

her is...' Oh, watch what happens!

14:23.960 --> 14:26.960
Hey! It was you!

14:26.960 --> 14:28.960
The video's on your phone,
you little scruff!

14:28.960 --> 14:32.000

Another one lost the plot.

You coming to get her, posh bellend?

14:34.960 --> 14:37.960
I mean, I don't get it,
but for some reason, she likes you.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.960
I think I'm the last person
she wants to see.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.000
I mean, you are right, love,
but she's only upset with you

14:42.000 --> 14:43.960
because she likes you.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.960
But, like, I really, really
do not get what she sees in you.

I'm sorry I haven't been doing
my regular slot for a while.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.480
It's just... Well, I had a bit
of bad news, to be honest with you.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.960
Aww.
Yeah.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.960
I was diagnosed
with primary progressive MS.

15:15.960 --> 15:16.960
It's all right.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.960
We had a Johnny Cash tribute
in here. Amazing.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.000
It's like being in the room
with him.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.160
LAUGHTER

15:21.160 --> 15:23.960
And your act was getting
quite a bit boring, mate.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.160
Quite a bit boring, Barbara?

15:25.160 --> 15:26.960
Well, no-one forces you
to come, love!

15:26.960 --> 15:28.960
LAUGHTER

15:28.960 --> 15:30.960
Oh, do you know what?

15:30.960 --> 15:32.960
One of you said to me there
in the toilet,

15:32.960 --> 15:34.960
"I thought you were dead, lad."

15:34.960 --> 15:38.960
I'll be honest with you.
Sometimes, it's felt like that.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.960
So sorry, lad.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.960
But see that beauty there?
That's our Aimee.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.960
She's been the strong one
through all this, not me.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.960
She sorted me some weed,

15:49.960 --> 15:51.960
which, you know,
really helps with the pain,

15:51.960 --> 15:55.960
and... she, er... she even made me
this walking cane.

15:56.960 --> 16:00.320
But I refuse to use it because then
it's like all this is real.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.960
I wanna be the man of house
and take care of her,

16:05.960 --> 16:09.160
but now I've got these fears
that my body's gonna let me down.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.960
And I don't wanna let you down, love.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.960
HE SOBS
Oh, God, listen to him.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.960
Right. Give me that.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.960
I also got him the weed
to make him sleepy,

16:22.960 --> 16:25.320
because when he's awake,
he does my head in.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.960
LAUGHTER

16:26.960 --> 16:28.960
Is there any need for you?

16:28.960 --> 16:31.960
I've just been pouring
my bloody heart out here! So?

16:31.960 --> 16:33.960
Have you got any idea
what it's like living with you?

16:33.960 --> 16:37.960
Every time I try and help, he moans.
Tell 'em all about that.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.000
That's cos
I don't want your help, love.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.960
And I don't want to be helping you

16:41.960 --> 16:44.960
off the bathroom floor at 4am
cos you fell.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.960
I wanna be helping Mia-Louise
into bed at 4am

16:46.960 --> 16:49.960
cos she's pissed out of her face
after a boss night with me.

16:49.960 --> 16:50.960
Oh!
LAUGHTER

16:50.960 --> 16:53.960
I don't want to be missing school
because I'm walking around shops

16:53.960 --> 16:55.960
looking for fennel seeds
cos you can't shit.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.960
LAUGHTER
All right.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.000
I wanna be in school,
enjoying myself.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.960
But I help you because I love you.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.960
Aw.
And this is our reality now.

17:05.960 --> 17:09.960
So we need to deal with it together,
the best that we can.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.640
I get it, love, I do. I get it.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.960
Look... can I have my hug now?

17:14.960 --> 17:16.960
No.
Oh!

17:16.960 --> 17:19.960
Cos you can start with listening
to me about using this cane.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.960

18:02.960 --> 18:06.480

Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that,

18:09.000 --> 18:12.960
Hey, come on. Tell me all about it.
Mine's a vodka and Coke. A double.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.960
You may have ruined your chance
to be Juliet,

18:16.960 --> 18:19.960
but if they're looking to cast
a Scouse Florence Nightingale,

18:19.960 --> 18:20.960
you're their girl.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.640
Who's Florence Nightingale?

18:22.640 --> 18:25.960
She was this nurse who, during...

about the TikTok video.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.160

that hacked you.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.160
I suppose it makes sense.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.960
It's just,
you were acting so strange.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.640
Why didn't you say something?

18:36.640 --> 18:38.960
It's not exactly the best
conversation-starter, is it?

18:38.960 --> 18:42.480
"Hey, my dad's got MS, and I have
no idea how to handle it."

18:42.480 --> 18:44.960
I don't know if there is
a right way to handle it,

18:44.960 --> 18:46.320
but you could try talking to me.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.960
Do I have to?
It's good to share.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.960
Look, you know the only reason
why I get away with being Romeo

18:52.960 --> 18:54.960
is because you're so good,

18:54.960 --> 18:56.960
you make me feel
like I'm in the moment.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.960

18:59.960 --> 19:03.640

Just promise me you'll do them.

Hey, look, as a thanks, let me
get you a Domino's. With what money?

20:44.960 --> 20:47.960
I've got my ma's credit card
saved to my Google account.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.960
Lad, you can't keep...

20:50.960 --> 20:52.960
Just put some Chicken Kickers
on there, lad.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.160
'Oh, for fuck's sake, Mum!'

20:54.160 --> 20:56.960
Yeah, well, good news
travels fast, don't it?

20:56.960 --> 20:58.960
Who told you?

20:58.960 --> 21:01.960
Steph? Yeah, well, she's not one
to be gossiping, is she?

21:02.960 --> 21:06.960
I have not lost the dressing room,
Mum!

21:06.960 --> 21:09.480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

21:10.960 --> 21:13.000
BOOING

21:16.960 --> 21:18.960
This is going straight on TikTok.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.480
From now on,
don't come past this line, OK?

21:26.480 --> 21:29.960
And keep YOUR ball on YOUR side!

21:29.960 --> 21:30.960
VAR decision.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.960
Er, still kicks the ball
like a two-year-old.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.960
VAR decision.
Erm, backstabbing thief!

21:40.960 --> 21:42.960
Knobhead!

21:43.960 --> 21:45.960
