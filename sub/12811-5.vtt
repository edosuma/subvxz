Gota get out of here. Go!

00:09.905 --> 00:12.525
- Just get rid of the Namorrodor.
- Just stories Waru

00:12.572 --> 00:14.644
- Like sand in claws.
- More people are going to die.

00:14.798 --> 00:16.798
- Unless you act.
- It's spoke to Koen again?

00:17.055 --> 00:18.498
What you want you me to beg?

00:18.531 --> 00:21.088
Will take a few minutes
the drug to make effect.

00:21.131 --> 00:23.131
You are so close to loose everything.

00:23.151 --> 00:26.131
We work to hard and too long for you
mess it up now.

00:28.786 --> 00:30.786
Help us.

00:31.279 --> 00:33.279

01:28.280 --> 01:30.547
- Hi.
- How are we today?

01:30.883 --> 01:33.683
A little bit nervous. I've been
through this quite a few times.

01:34.053 --> 01:37.154
We've managed to harvest and
fertilize very impressive embryos.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.622
I have full confidence.

01:38.857 --> 01:41.024
Oh, this is my husband.

01:41.126 --> 01:42.759
Jarrod Slade.

01:43.028 --> 01:44.861
- Pleased to meet you.
- And you.

01:44.963 --> 01:46.396
Come through.

01:50.736 --> 01:54.271
Thinking of England. (sighs)

01:54.506 --> 01:55.705
Think boy or girl.

01:55.941 --> 01:56.840
All right, Charlotte.

01:57.109 --> 01:58.575
I'm just gonna ask you to relax.

01:58.777 --> 02:00.977
Okay, keep steady.

02:01.180 --> 02:03.880
<i>Here we go.</i>

02:11.256 --> 02:13.523
Oh!

No, a couple of years, a few
more melted polar ice caps,

03:36.767 --> 03:38.934
then we'll be the ones with waterfront.

03:39.236 --> 03:41.228
Perhaps we should be selling, Charlotte.

03:41.253 --> 03:42.128
Yeah.

03:42.339 --> 03:43.939
It's a lovely meal.

03:44.275 --> 03:46.642
Oh, thank you, but Jarrod
takes the credit for lunch.

03:46.877 --> 03:49.378
- No.
- Oh, you can cook, too?

03:49.613 --> 03:52.214
Waruu here can't boil an egg.

03:52.483 --> 03:54.783
I enjoy the alchemy of the kitchen.

04:34.325 --> 04:36.492
- Is everything okay?
- I'm pregnant.

04:36.727 --> 04:39.027
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.231
Okay, well, that was about
three months premature.

04:42.433 --> 04:44.533
I won't say a thing.

04:44.768 --> 04:46.435
Oh, is it something you want?

04:46.670 --> 04:48.804
Oh, God, yeah. I just...

04:49.039 --> 04:50.772
- I didn't think I could.
- Oh.

04:51.008 --> 04:53.876
Well, I'm really happy for you.

04:54.078 --> 04:55.878
(both laugh)

04:56.080 --> 04:57.546
Congratulations.

04:57.781 --> 05:00.082
Oh, God. I hope it sticks.

05:00.351 --> 05:01.750
Sorry, I'm just after the bathroom.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.453
Oh, God, I'm sorry. It's just down here.

05:04.622 --> 05:05.954
Great.

05:28.045 --> 05:30.479
Blair, wait. Blair, we
don't know who's in there.

05:30.648 --> 05:32.447
Blair!

05:46.630 --> 05:48.263
Blair: <i>Grab something to hold her.</i>

05:48.499 --> 05:49.565
We got to go, brother.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.533
I'm not leaving her here like this.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.600
So why are we here?

06:24.969 --> 06:28.070
Charlotte's filled me in with what
you're trying to do in the Zone.

06:28.405 --> 06:31.173
The issues you're facing with
a lack of basic amenities,

06:31.442 --> 06:34.009
the ongoing accommodation crisis.

06:34.245 --> 06:36.044
I'd like to help you out.

06:36.280 --> 06:39.414
- You offering me money?
- Mmm.

06:39.750 --> 06:42.251
I'm always on the lookout for
worthy philanthropic projects.

06:42.486 --> 06:43.785
Yours is a good cause.

06:44.054 --> 06:46.021
Right in my own backyard, too.

06:46.290 --> 06:48.790
Well, not quite your backyard.

06:49.093 --> 06:51.126
Come on, you tell me how much you need

06:51.462 --> 06:54.029
to kick-start some real
improvements in the Zone.

06:54.198 --> 06:56.465
300,000.

06:56.767 --> 06:59.167
From what I understand of the situation,

06:59.403 --> 07:01.436
300 won't touch the sides.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.842
Three million.

07:08.112 --> 07:09.878
You're a man of vision, Waruu.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.414
Why don't we add another zero to that?

07:12.650 --> 07:14.449
Can't take that much money.

07:14.652 --> 07:16.051
30 million.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.186
Now you can leverage off that capital.

07:18.489 --> 07:22.424
Turn it into 300 million.
Build a citadel.

07:22.726 --> 07:24.893
I'm giving you the chance
to have a real stake

07:25.129 --> 07:26.662
in your people's future.

07:26.964 --> 07:29.164
Before people like Matthews
take that away, too.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.600
I would feel comfortable with less.

07:31.935 --> 07:36.571
Moses led the Israelites
out of the wilderness.

07:36.874 --> 07:40.242
He didn't just drop them off
at the bus stop midway.

07:42.012 --> 07:44.079
Take the money, Waruu.

07:44.315 --> 07:45.814
Let's stop mucking about.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.419
And what do you want in return?

07:52.456 --> 07:54.089
Your brother.

08:40.837 --> 08:42.938
(speaking native dialect)

08:46.443 --> 08:49.211
I still don't understand
a word you're saying.

09:08.165 --> 09:10.098
Let's go.

09:11.835 --> 09:13.869
If we go into the Zone half-cocked,

09:14.071 --> 09:15.470
we will lose personnel.

09:15.739 --> 09:17.172
Then do your job properly.

09:17.441 --> 09:20.175
You promised me air support, tear gas.

09:20.411 --> 09:22.677
For three kids? Come on.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.115
- (groans)
- What happened to you?

09:27.317 --> 09:29.084
Subhuman encounter.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.686
Send a couple of cars in.

09:31.955 --> 09:33.655
I don't care about collateral damage.

09:33.891 --> 09:35.190
I can work with that.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.426
But three Hairy boys
loose in the streets

09:37.694 --> 09:39.828
tearing people's hearts out...

09:40.030 --> 09:43.031
They didn't. I did.

09:43.233 --> 09:44.666
You killed Dickson?

09:44.968 --> 09:47.936
No, I just made the best
of a bad situation.

09:48.205 --> 09:50.806
That symbol on the wall, that was you?

09:51.141 --> 09:53.375
Your approval rating
went up 10 percentage points

09:53.677 --> 09:57.412
after your press release,
after that image went viral.

09:57.681 --> 10:00.315
Now, did I do the wrong thing?

10:00.551 --> 10:03.518
- Hey!
- Hey, dickheads.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.720
Look here.

10:05.923 --> 10:08.190
Get me those boys.

10:08.492 --> 10:10.659
- Come on, come on.
- <i> (sirens wailing)</i>

10:10.861 --> 10:12.093

10:12.396 --> 10:14.162
- (crowd chanting)
- Boy: <i> Welcome to the Zone.</i>

10:14.498 --> 10:16.898
- The savage. Stop! Show us your hands.
- Stop!

10:17.134 --> 10:18.533
Wait! Don't shoot.

10:18.802 --> 10:21.470
That's assaulting an officer.

10:23.173 --> 10:25.507
- Stay down. Get down.
- (screaming)

10:25.876 --> 10:27.400
Get off! Get off me!

10:27.425 --> 10:29.835
Don't touch a CA officer, you rug bastard.

10:30.113 --> 10:33.181
Okay, Max, I'm gonna need you
to keep your eyes open.

10:33.450 --> 10:35.884
Okay? Can you try? It's gonna hurt.

10:36.153 --> 10:37.853
Okay, let me just get the milk in there.

10:38.155 --> 10:40.121
- Okay? Oh, I know it hurts.
- (groaning)

10:40.491 --> 10:43.358
I know it hurts. Just try and
keep them open. What happened?

10:43.727 --> 10:45.861
We were just fooling around and
the guards pulled out their guns.

10:46.230 --> 10:49.798
Then they went Uncle Max. Kicked
him on the ground and stuff.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.767
- You all right, Uncle?
- (groaning)

11:01.078 --> 11:02.744
I've got to go, brother.

11:03.113 --> 11:05.447
Come on, we can't stick around here.
Let me drop you somewhere.

11:05.649 --> 11:06.948
Getting rid of me?

11:07.251 --> 11:09.050
It's not safe for you where I got to go.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.285
<i>Dump and run time?</i>

11:10.554 --> 11:11.720
I've got shit to deal with, Blair.

11:11.955 --> 11:13.188
<i>And it doesn't involve you.</i>

11:13.490 --> 11:16.725
- It's a bit late for that.
- <i> Blair.</i>

11:17.094 --> 11:18.636
- <i> Blair.</i>
- You knew what was gonna happen to Ash,

11:18.661 --> 11:19.652
didn't you?

11:21.031 --> 11:24.232
<i>(laughs) That's why you had the gun.</i>

11:24.434 --> 11:26.134
<i>(liquid pouring)</i>

11:26.403 --> 11:28.470
You knew and you didn't tell me.

11:32.910 --> 11:34.676
<i>Did he know?</i>

11:34.912 --> 11:36.678
(speaking native dialect)

11:36.914 --> 11:39.678
See? Kora knows you're an ass.

11:39.914 --> 11:42.884
- Don't you, Kora?
- Ass.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.556
I remember when I first met him.

11:47.724 --> 11:49.286
I was 13

11:50.360 --> 11:52.327
sleeping rough under a bridge.

11:54.231 --> 11:56.998
But it was better than sleeping
at home with a randy old man.

11:58.101 --> 11:59.834
It was cold.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.206
Freeze a witch's tit off cold.

12:07.444 --> 12:09.711
And this guy comes up asking
for somewhere to sleep.

12:10.047 --> 12:11.713
- But he didn't have anything.
- I just split the Zone.

12:12.015 --> 12:14.249
<i>He was full of the same old Koen shit.</i>

12:16.286 --> 12:19.187
Telling stories, making us laugh.

12:19.556 --> 12:21.990
You're a funny bastard when you
want something, aren't you, Koen?

12:26.997 --> 12:29.230
Then he wanted my sleeping bag.

12:32.235 --> 12:34.269
Later he wanted my girlfriend.

12:39.610 --> 12:42.077
- <i> I knew.</i>
- No.

12:43.914 --> 12:45.480
No.

12:45.782 --> 12:47.649
Come on, brother, you got that wrong.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.686
That's not what she's saying.

12:55.592 --> 12:57.592
Kora, do you concur?

12:57.794 --> 13:00.670
(speaks native dialect)

13:04.159 --> 13:07.995
Kora concurs. So that's three
against one says you lie.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.333
We need to go.

13:09.358 --> 13:11.828
I'm not going anywhere until
you say you screwed Ash.

13:12.609 --> 13:14.075
<i>(knock on door)</i>

13:14.311 --> 13:15.977
- We're not open!
- Say it.

13:17.481 --> 13:19.881
- Okay, whatever.
- Not good enough.

13:23.420 --> 13:25.720
Say "I screwed Ash."

13:40.804 --> 13:42.937
I screwed Ash.

13:44.941 --> 13:47.175
How many times? Lose count?

13:47.411 --> 13:49.511
It didn't mean anything.

13:49.846 --> 13:52.747
So you screwed my girlfriend
and it didn't mean anything?

13:52.949 --> 13:54.582
Is that what you're saying?

13:54.718 --> 13:56.484
Ass.

14:02.359 --> 14:04.292

16:57.293 --> 16:59.193
The Zoners, they're
no different from you.

16:59.562 --> 17:02.763
<i>They're just trying to raise their
families as best as they can.</i>

17:03.065 --> 17:04.665
And now you stop
food trucks from getting in.

17:04.867 --> 17:06.532
There's children in there.

17:06.935 --> 17:08.377
Whatever happened to live and let live?

17:08.402 --> 17:09.126
Man: <i> Get a real job.</i>

17:09.438 --> 17:11.771
- Whatever happened...
- Woman: <i> Stop helping savvies.</i>

17:13.976 --> 17:16.108
- You're the ones that are subhuman!
- (man laughs)

17:16.478 --> 17:19.313
- Hey, hey, monkey!
- You're the ones that are subhuman.

17:20.849 --> 17:23.483
You're the ones that are subhuman.

17:23.786 --> 17:26.553
Man #2: <i>Get back inside,
you Hairy lover.</i>

17:28.891 --> 17:31.191
Welcome to the Zone.

17:39.969 --> 17:42.202
<i>(knocks on door)</i>

17:42.404 --> 17:44.271
Just push it.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.449
Well, here's trouble.

17:55.684 --> 17:57.417
Blair: <i>Hey, I'm Blair.</i>

17:57.586 --> 17:59.653
This is Ash.

18:01.523 --> 18:05.092
We're operating under the
idea that her name is Kora.

18:05.327 --> 18:06.593
<i>But we've got no idea.</i>

18:06.829 --> 18:10.130
_

18:12.401 --> 18:13.634
You understand her?

18:23.012 --> 18:24.645
Where'd you say you know her from?

18:24.947 --> 18:27.347
- We sort of picked her up.
- Picked her up where?

18:30.552 --> 18:34.422
_

18:34.913 --> 18:37.742
_

18:38.093 --> 18:39.326
Ass.

18:39.528 --> 18:41.428
Suck it up.

18:52.041 --> 18:53.440
No.

18:53.642 --> 18:55.776
That's not good.

18:57.313 --> 18:58.812
She's not from here.

19:00.215 --> 19:02.883
<i>This is old spiritual stuff here.</i>

19:03.152 --> 19:05.686
<i>She's like some kind
of ancestral spirit.</i>

19:08.657 --> 19:10.624
You didn't screw her, did you, boy?

19:10.893 --> 19:13.593
He screws anything that moves.

19:21.804 --> 19:23.870
<i>(distant siren wailing)</i>

19:36.919 --> 19:38.885
Where's my phone, you Hairy bitch?

19:41.590 --> 19:43.190
You're gonna regret this.

19:48.297 --> 19:49.997
Get up.

19:50.165 --> 19:51.665
Get up!

19:53.836 --> 19:56.803
If I find out that
you are lying to me...

19:57.072 --> 19:59.873
<i>you're lying to me about this...</i>

20:00.075 --> 20:01.541
What's the problem?

20:01.777 --> 20:04.077
She's got my phone.

20:04.413 --> 20:05.679
I had it on me when I
was doing her nails.

20:05.948 --> 20:07.914
She must have hidden it someplace.

20:09.351 --> 20:11.752
I'll ask you once.

20:11.954 --> 20:13.854
Do you have her phone?

20:14.123 --> 20:16.690
- You're lying.
- Shut up, Rowena.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.999
If I find out you're lying
to me about the phone...

20:26.201 --> 20:28.201
Who would I call?

20:39.515 --> 20:41.581
You're off your face.

20:41.884 --> 20:44.885
- (electricity crackles)
- (groans)

20:45.254 --> 20:48.989
How many times do we have to
have this conversation, Rowena?

20:49.324 --> 20:52.659
- (sobbing)
- No doing drugs in Frankie's house.

20:52.828 --> 20:54.161
(crackling)

20:54.430 --> 20:56.630
<i>(Rowena whimpering, mutters)</i>

21:04.106 --> 21:05.572
<i>(door closes, lock clicks)</i>

21:09.011 --> 21:10.410
Here.

21:15.150 --> 21:19.331
_

21:22.751 --> 21:25.932
_

21:30.866 --> 21:33.366
(sighs)

21:33.569 --> 21:35.335
(scoffs)

21:35.604 --> 21:37.671
You got to send her back, Koen.

21:37.973 --> 21:40.707
- Back?
- To her home, her dimension.

21:40.976 --> 21:44.177
(scoffs) Yeah, go on, Cleverman.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.546
Send her home.

21:46.849 --> 21:49.683
Use your fancy stick.
Do your magic thing.

21:49.918 --> 21:51.618
You want another drink, buru?

21:51.887 --> 21:53.386
Hey, don't be a smart-ass.

21:53.689 --> 21:56.623
<i>You need to take her
to the old fig tree,</i>

21:56.925 --> 21:59.426
<i>where Jimmy used to take you and Waruu.</i>

21:59.695 --> 22:01.795
All I know is she got to get home

22:02.030 --> 22:03.363
and you're the one make it happen.

22:03.565 --> 22:05.365
I don't know shit.

22:05.567 --> 22:07.067
Pretty accurate.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.543
<i>(announcer) Coming up...</i>

22:17.646 --> 22:19.513
<i>(panting)</i>

22:19.615 --> 22:21.448
<i>(grunting, groaning)</i>

22:22.424 --> 22:24.892
<i>(announcer) Stay tuned
for more "Cleverman".</i>

22:34.203 --> 22:38.106
(winces, groans)

23:29.449 --> 23:32.717
Waruu: <i>Clean functioning housing
for everyone in the Zone.</i>

23:32.986 --> 23:35.019
It's everything we've ever dreamed of.

23:35.188 --> 23:36.354
More.

23:38.091 --> 23:39.357
It's big money you're talking about.

23:39.593 --> 23:40.859
<i>How much is Slade offering?</i>

23:41.161 --> 23:42.527
Enough to get a business plan together,

23:42.829 --> 23:44.729
<i>to redevelop, to approach
the bank for a loan.</i>

23:44.931 --> 23:46.397
How much?

23:48.869 --> 23:50.835
$30 million.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.939
(laughs)

23:55.242 --> 23:57.375
And, what, Jarrod Slade's just gonna

23:57.644 --> 23:58.676
hand over the money just like that?

23:58.912 --> 24:00.144
It's already in our bank account.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.946
What?

24:04.284 --> 24:06.517
When a white man gives a black
man that kind of money,

24:06.753 --> 24:07.986
he wants something back.

24:08.188 --> 24:09.420
What does he get?

24:09.723 --> 24:11.856
- He's a philanthropist.
- What does he get?

24:11.977 --> 24:13.576
I'm trying to create a viable
future here for our people

24:14.160 --> 24:15.393
- and you're asking me questions?
- It's a simple question.

24:15.459 --> 24:17.862
- What does he get?
- What options do we have?

24:18.131 --> 24:20.231
Hey. What are you doing up?

24:20.500 --> 24:22.267
You all right?
You want something to eat?

24:22.569 --> 24:26.905
No, I'm good. I'm here
to speak with my son.

24:27.140 --> 24:28.706
Who won't even look at me.

24:28.909 --> 24:31.075
What do you want?

24:31.311 --> 24:34.012
Some bad shit's been going down.

24:34.281 --> 24:36.814
Jimmy... he's messed things up.

24:37.050 --> 24:38.016
What are you on about?

24:38.184 --> 24:40.585
Koen.

24:40.787 --> 24:42.420
He needs your help.

24:42.589 --> 24:44.155
Koen's here?

24:44.357 --> 24:45.990
In the Zone?

24:46.192 --> 24:48.059
Right next door.

24:54.634 --> 24:58.336
Linda: <i>Says he found her
in some sort of laboratory</i>

24:58.638 --> 25:01.205
<i>tied to a bed with tubes
sticking out of her.</i>

25:01.441 --> 25:03.341
<i>Mean anything to you?</i>

25:03.610 --> 25:05.643
- No.
- <i> Jimmy, did he mention?</i>

25:05.946 --> 25:07.679
Jimmy stopped making
any sense a long time ago.

25:07.914 --> 25:10.348
<i>(people shouting)</i>

25:10.583 --> 25:12.150
How did you find this place?

25:12.352 --> 25:14.419
She called me.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.121
Got inside my head.

25:17.357 --> 25:20.291
<i>Calling over and over.</i>

25:20.460 --> 25:21.559
What else?

25:21.828 --> 25:25.196
I grabbed her, took her to the bar.

25:26.499 --> 25:28.366
Then nothing till...

25:30.403 --> 25:32.503
this guy came around looking for her.

25:32.706 --> 25:35.807
<i>He had a gun.</i>

25:36.042 --> 25:38.743
He killed my friend.

25:39.045 --> 25:41.112
- <i> So I shot him.</i>
- Now, that was smart.

25:41.448 --> 25:43.214
- <i> There was this other dude.</i>
- Shoot him, too?

25:43.450 --> 25:46.451
Different bloke. Tall.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.920
Spoke with his head up his ass.

25:49.222 --> 25:52.090
<i>Coming offering condolences for Jimmy.</i>

25:52.359 --> 25:55.126
<i>Told me he was a friend of his.</i>

25:55.362 --> 25:57.428
Offered me a job, too.

25:57.664 --> 25:59.464
Straight out of the blue.

25:59.666 --> 26:00.898
What'd you tell him?

26:01.101 --> 26:02.467
Told him to get lost.

26:02.702 --> 26:04.836
You seen a guy like that?

26:07.640 --> 26:10.108
<i>Well, Kora needs to be sent back.</i>

26:10.310 --> 26:12.076
<i>First things first.</i>

26:12.345 --> 26:15.713
We have to get rid of the Namorrodor.

26:15.915 --> 26:18.549
That's your job...

26:18.718 --> 26:20.151
Cleverman.

26:21.154 --> 26:22.653
It always comes back to that.

26:22.989 --> 26:25.923
Killing it's the only thing
that's gonna save the Hairies.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.694
-<i> We should do it tonight.</i>
- Now?

26:29.863 --> 26:32.697
Why not?

26:32.966 --> 26:35.299
Before more people get killed.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.569
Your call.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.641
And leave her at home.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.453
I was thinking...

26:55.755 --> 26:58.623
maybe it's time you wound up
your work in the Zone.

26:58.892 --> 27:00.925
<i>At least till after the baby.</i>

27:01.194 --> 27:03.161
That's eight and a half months away.

27:04.631 --> 27:06.230
What am I gonna do instead?

27:06.499 --> 27:09.300
- Stay home and crochet?
- There's a thought.

27:09.602 --> 27:12.537
I intend to work until the day I drop.

27:12.872 --> 27:15.740
If you were working in an
office or a GP practice, maybe.

27:15.909 --> 27:17.175
Oh, come on.

27:17.410 --> 27:19.710
It's a dangerous place.

27:19.913 --> 27:21.879
It's not your battle.

27:22.148 --> 27:23.848
Someone needs to take a stand.

27:24.184 --> 27:27.051
Those CA animals used capsicum
spray on an unarmed man today.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.787
Exactly, a volatile situation.

27:31.391 --> 27:33.658
It's not just you to consider.

27:36.930 --> 27:39.530
Ah, you thinking about your heir?

27:39.766 --> 27:41.632
You are, aren't you?

27:42.721 --> 27:45.922
Our baby is in rudest of rude health.

27:46.439 --> 27:48.005
Okay? I did an ultrasound today.

27:48.274 --> 27:50.575
Its development is off the charts.

27:50.810 --> 27:52.310
Must be my good genes.

27:52.479 --> 27:53.945
(laughs)

27:54.280 --> 27:57.048
What you gonna be like
in eight and a half months, eh?

27:57.250 --> 27:58.983
A monster.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.874
So we lure this thing.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.942
Say it comes.

28:25.111 --> 28:26.978
Then what?

28:27.180 --> 28:29.046
Then you kill it.

28:29.349 --> 28:31.516
And it goes back
to wherever it came from?

28:33.720 --> 28:36.053
<i>And Kora?</i>

28:36.322 --> 28:38.089
You'll be in your full powers.

28:38.391 --> 28:40.958
You open up the portal,
you send her back.

28:46.466 --> 28:48.533
That's not gonna work.

28:48.801 --> 28:50.201
You bring the nulla nulla?

28:50.403 --> 28:52.203
It's in the boot.

28:52.405 --> 28:54.238
It's in the boot.

28:54.474 --> 28:56.107
You better go and get it.

28:57.510 --> 28:58.876
So, what, I just club it to death?

28:59.045 --> 29:00.611
I guess.

29:00.914 --> 29:02.346
Is that all the advice
you're gonna give me?

29:02.649 --> 29:06.984
It's quick and it goes for the heart.

29:08.821 --> 29:10.988
(chuckles)

29:46.326 --> 29:48.526
(chanting)

30:29.702 --> 30:30.501
(beeps)

30:30.703 --> 30:32.703
Go, go, go! Go!

30:33.906 --> 30:36.107
(screaming)

30:42.115 --> 30:44.148
<i>(grunts)</i>

30:49.289 --> 30:51.322
(gasping)

30:58.756 --> 31:00.390
(chanting)

31:00.624 --> 31:02.592
It's not working.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.254
It's not coming, Waruu.
Something's wrong.

31:12.394 --> 31:15.228
- It's probably your chanting.
- You want to do this or not?

31:15.597 --> 31:17.730
'Cause you don't look like you do.
Looks like you want to run.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.232
Stuff you.

31:22.938 --> 31:25.471
Go on, then. Take it.

31:27.142 --> 31:28.441
Go on, take it.

31:28.777 --> 31:31.110
Uncle Jimmy stuffed up. This
is your chance to unstuff it.

31:32.948 --> 31:35.548
Take the nulla nulla, Waruu.

31:35.784 --> 31:37.317
Go on, be the Cleverman.

31:37.519 --> 31:40.119
(trills)

31:42.023 --> 31:44.090
Take it.

31:44.359 --> 31:46.225
That's not how this works.

31:47.562 --> 31:49.228
What?

31:49.497 --> 31:51.831
Am I supposed to die first? That it?

31:58.139 --> 32:00.673
That's what you're waiting
for, isn't it, you dog?

32:03.645 --> 32:05.712
I know I die.

32:07.182 --> 32:08.715
I've seen it.

32:08.984 --> 32:10.817
What you see and what eventually...

32:11.119 --> 32:13.219
So how does it work, then, brother, huh?

32:13.521 --> 32:15.254
Tell me, do I get mauled to death,

32:15.457 --> 32:17.056
and then you take over?

32:17.359 --> 32:20.760
<i>Be the man you've always wanted to be?</i>

32:22.597 --> 32:23.963
Take it.

32:34.042 --> 32:35.575
Yeah, run.

32:35.844 --> 32:38.011
That's what you're good at, boy.

32:38.246 --> 32:40.780
You're a sellout, Koen.

32:42.117 --> 32:43.916
<i>Sell your own mother if you could.</i>

32:46.821 --> 32:49.155
Even when we were kids,

32:49.424 --> 32:52.392
it's always been about my mother, eh?

32:52.594 --> 32:54.394
Koen's a coconut.

32:54.629 --> 32:56.896
Koen's got a white slut mother.

32:59.634 --> 33:01.300
Well, I never had a chance to meet her,

33:01.636 --> 33:03.936
so I don't know how
you're such an expert.

33:04.039 --> 33:05.738
Huh?

33:08.910 --> 33:11.144
Your mother was a whore.

33:12.747 --> 33:15.248
You're the living proof.

33:15.350 --> 33:17.150
Bastard.

33:42.310 --> 33:43.576
Oh, do you want to keep
going, then, brah?

34:01.229 --> 34:03.162
It's not over yet, brother.

34:35.897 --> 34:38.097
- (boy groaning)
- Maliyan: Shh.

34:38.433 --> 34:41.400
- <i> (distant baby crying)</i>
- (speaks native language)

34:43.071 --> 34:44.536
(boy wheezing)

34:44.739 --> 34:47.507
- Shh.
- (boy groans)

34:47.708 --> 34:49.574
Go to sleep.

34:51.312 --> 34:53.045
- (speaks native language)
- (boy groaning)

34:53.148 --> 34:54.780
Shh.

35:07.495 --> 35:09.795
Hey, little one.

35:11.032 --> 35:13.132
How about I make the pain go away?

35:14.836 --> 35:16.802
I know a special way.

35:17.005 --> 35:18.771
You interested?

35:22.076 --> 35:23.876
I'm gonna let you in on a secret.

35:24.078 --> 35:25.912
I can fly.

35:27.348 --> 35:29.415
When we fly,

35:29.617 --> 35:33.586
the pain just goes away.

35:33.788 --> 35:35.054
You want to try?

35:35.356 --> 35:38.224
- (imitating airplane)
- (boy laughing)

35:52.173 --> 35:53.973
Djukara.

35:58.713 --> 36:00.313
Okay, bud.

36:00.548 --> 36:02.114
Djukara's out of fuel now.

36:02.217 --> 36:04.317
Mungo.

36:19.300 --> 36:21.601
It all go down how you wanted?

36:25.673 --> 36:27.907
What's happened to you?

36:30.345 --> 36:31.811
I can explain.

36:31.913 --> 36:33.546
No need.

36:33.748 --> 36:35.114
I saw the tape.

36:35.416 --> 36:37.817
You killed that guard
with your bare hands.

36:38.086 --> 36:40.419
No, no. It wasn't like that.

36:40.622 --> 36:41.587
I saw how it was.

36:41.856 --> 36:43.723
Nerida, I swear I had no choice.

36:44.025 --> 36:47.627
- You have to believe me.
- Believe you? How can I?

36:49.197 --> 36:50.930
Well, come on, then.

36:51.165 --> 36:53.432
Give me your reason.

36:53.635 --> 36:55.601
Level with me.

36:55.837 --> 36:58.037
Tell me what's going on.

36:59.674 --> 37:01.607
Hmm?

37:01.909 --> 37:04.076
Tell me about this deal
you've got with Slade.

37:06.781 --> 37:09.315
Tell me.

37:09.617 --> 37:12.118
Must be pretty freaking bad
if you can't tell me.

37:13.955 --> 37:15.788
Is it worse than killing a
man with your bare hands?

37:15.990 --> 37:17.523
It was him or me.

37:19.394 --> 37:21.594
I thought I knew you.

37:21.863 --> 37:24.630
I've no freaking idea who you are.

37:26.501 --> 37:30.002
- Look, Nerida.
- No, don't you touch me.

37:35.343 --> 37:38.344
<i>(train rattling)</i>

37:45.353 --> 37:46.752
<i>(people chattering)</i>

37:46.854 --> 37:48.621
Hey.

37:59.534 --> 38:01.434
(grunts)

38:03.104 --> 38:05.071
It's your fault my sister's dead.

38:06.708 --> 38:09.475
You have destroyed everything.

38:09.577 --> 38:11.577
Shoot.

38:12.814 --> 38:15.047
Go on.

38:15.149 --> 38:16.916
Do it.

38:20.455 --> 38:22.254
- Do it!
- (gunshot)

38:22.557 --> 38:25.358
<i>- (dog barking)
- (people shouting)</i>

38:39.307 --> 38:41.907
(gasps)

38:51.619 --> 38:54.253
Linda: <i>What happened out there?</i>

38:54.455 --> 38:56.055
Koen: <i>Nothing.</i>

38:59.293 --> 39:01.460
Never was going to.

39:02.597 --> 39:05.030
I'm not the one.

39:06.934 --> 39:08.401
I'm just a stuff-up.

39:08.603 --> 39:09.702
Don't say that.

39:09.904 --> 39:12.004
I couldn't save Ash.

39:17.712 --> 39:19.578
I couldn't save Ash.

39:22.216 --> 39:23.616
And a kid.

39:26.754 --> 39:29.855
Little Hairy girl is dead because of me.

39:35.963 --> 39:39.832
I sold her family out
to the CA for some extra cash.

39:42.203 --> 39:44.236
CA might have pulled the trigger,

39:44.505 --> 39:46.572
but it's my fault that she died.

39:50.111 --> 39:52.578
Doesn't sound so clever to me.

39:57.485 --> 39:59.585
(sniffles)

40:01.189 --> 40:03.355
She was just a kid.

40:05.026 --> 40:07.460
<i>And the last thing
that she said to me...</i>

40:10.031 --> 40:12.398
she thanked me.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.133
Okay.

40:14.402 --> 40:16.669
Come here, love. Come on.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.040
Minister.

40:37.342 --> 40:39.776
Your man McIntyre needs
to be pulled into line.

40:40.112 --> 40:42.879
He's refusing to send down
squads into the Zone.

40:43.181 --> 40:45.348
The brief has always been
one of containment.

40:45.651 --> 40:48.785
Situations change, therefore
responses must change.

40:51.023 --> 40:53.990
You go in there armed
and it'll be carnage.

40:54.192 --> 40:55.625
That's the idea.

40:55.861 --> 40:57.761
<i>Assets will be destroyed.</i>

40:58.030 --> 41:00.096
The general public won't like that.

41:02.034 --> 41:05.702
Right now we have the Zone
population like fish in a barrel.

41:05.971 --> 41:07.504
What are you guys up to in there?

41:07.873 --> 41:10.240
Don't worry. Our interests
are not mutually exclusive.

41:10.475 --> 41:12.375
I want the Zone cleared.

41:12.711 --> 41:14.611
If your company won't do it,
I'll find one that can.

41:14.913 --> 41:16.746
And risk losing the support
of my network?

41:17.015 --> 41:18.481
Do we have to keep playing this game?

41:18.784 --> 41:20.717
The public want to feel
safe in their homes

41:21.053 --> 41:23.653
and on the streets and I'm
gonna make that happen.

41:23.889 --> 41:26.389
The Zone will be cleansed.

41:30.228 --> 41:32.062
(sighs)

41:33.732 --> 41:36.399
And after it's empty...

41:36.568 --> 41:38.001
this.

41:38.270 --> 41:41.204
Top-floor penthouse I've set aside.

41:41.406 --> 41:43.173
Wonderful, isn't it?

41:43.408 --> 41:46.609
Sweeping 360 views of the city,

41:46.778 --> 41:48.478
the harbor.

41:48.647 --> 41:50.280
(sighs)

41:50.582 --> 41:53.650
I reckon you're gonna
be happy living there.

41:55.887 --> 41:58.421
I've been talking to Frankie
about purchasing you.

42:00.225 --> 42:01.825
Outright.

42:11.470 --> 42:14.304
Okay, so you take these twice a day.

42:14.506 --> 42:17.006
<i>(boy wheezing)</i>

42:19.044 --> 42:21.244
And some Valium while you're at it.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.512
<i>Okay.</i>

42:22.714 --> 42:24.647
<i>(boy moaning)</i>

42:24.816 --> 42:26.716
Eve.

42:27.018 --> 42:29.419
There's something weird on his skin.
Scratches.

42:29.654 --> 42:30.987
They're getting bigger.

42:32.924 --> 42:35.492
Charlotte: <i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

42:35.727 --> 42:40.296
<i>Ooh, doesn't look good.</i>

42:40.499 --> 42:43.066
<i>Hold on...</i>

42:46.671 --> 42:48.271
When did this happen?

42:48.473 --> 42:50.173
I don't know.

42:50.342 --> 42:52.409
Shh.

42:52.611 --> 42:54.611
Come on, lie back.

43:03.188 --> 43:06.189
Alinta, go get Koen now.

43:07.926 --> 43:11.194
Eve, you still got them
eucalyptus leaves I gave you?

43:12.764 --> 43:13.863
What do I tell him?

43:14.099 --> 43:15.398
Tell him to get here now

43:15.667 --> 43:17.100
or I'll kick his ass into tomorrow.

43:17.302 --> 43:18.735
Go on, get him.

43:18.970 --> 43:20.837
Do you know what this is?

43:21.206 --> 43:25.375
Yeah. I'm afraid there's nothing
in your bag of tricks to fix this.

43:25.610 --> 43:28.611
It's not a what, it's a who.

43:40.725 --> 43:43.426
You've been to a smoking
ceremony before, haven't you?

43:43.595 --> 43:44.961
Yeah.

43:45.230 --> 43:47.430
Good. You're running this one.

43:47.699 --> 43:49.732
There's a young boy in there

43:49.968 --> 43:51.434
in a whole lot of pain.

43:51.703 --> 43:53.002
Something wrong about it all.

43:53.305 --> 43:54.804
Go and get your dad.
He should be doing this.

43:55.073 --> 43:56.906
Nah, time for you to step up.

43:57.142 --> 43:59.776
I'm not the one. Get Waruu.

44:00.045 --> 44:01.611
We don't always get a chance to do good.

44:01.980 --> 44:05.415
If I was you, I'd grab this
opportunity with both hands.

44:18.830 --> 44:21.030
<i>(boy moans)</i>

44:23.869 --> 44:24.968
I know, right?

44:27.339 --> 44:29.372
Okay, everyone's got to get out now.

44:29.574 --> 44:31.541
Okay, clear out.

44:31.743 --> 44:33.776
Go on, get, now.

44:34.012 --> 44:36.045
<i>All of you, go on.</i>

44:41.186 --> 44:43.019
You, too, darling.
It's not safe for you.

44:43.221 --> 44:44.854
You have to go.

44:47.526 --> 44:49.526
- Over to you.
- I can't.

45:05.143 --> 45:07.810
(singing in native dialect)

45:44.983 --> 45:48.351
Whoever's in there,
it's safe to come out.

46:03.134 --> 46:06.269
Follow the smoke. It will set you free.

47:21.112 --> 47:22.545
I'm so sorry.

47:26.484 --> 47:28.584
Please forgive me.

47:40.832 --> 47:43.499
The smoke will lead you
where you need to go.

48:07.125 --> 48:11.127
