essentially, the same speed.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.184
Then why are they so much faster than him?

02:26.355 --> 02:29.768
Best I can tell, with each stride,
their feet spend less time on the ground,

02:29.942 --> 02:32.354
thus propelling them forward much faster.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.029

how they increased horsepower,

If Thawne ﬁgures out that it's you,

07:03.716 --> 07:05.502
the timeline will be altered,

07:05.676 --> 07:07.007
people can die.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.759
Others could live, and no one will know
who or what will be affected.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.639
but I promise you, when you come back
things will be different.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.845
And only you will know
what those differences are.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.929

to stop Zoom, then so be it.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.691

everybody in this whole city,

07:26.864 --> 07:29.276
their world will never
be the same, anyway.

07:39.752 --> 07:41.367

you're gonna go back to the time

07:59.396 --> 08:03.184

of the major jackass, Hartley Rathaway.

08:03.359 --> 08:07.102

Wells knew the accelerator might explode,

08:07.279 --> 08:08.860
and we were all angry with him.

about your behavior,

08:11.742 --> 08:13.357

08:14.161 --> 08:17.278
Also, remember,
do not underestimate Hartley.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.571
He almost killed you.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.912
This is a tranq dart that should knock
old-you out for about six hours.

08:22.086 --> 08:23.826
Which lines up perfectly
for when you're going back,

08:24.004 --> 08:25.335
because not much was happening,

08:25.506 --> 08:28.043
until Hartley attacks
the Cleveland Dam that night.

08:28.217 --> 08:31.334
So, that should give you time
to Ieam what you need and retum.

08:31.512 --> 08:35.596
CISCO: One more thing, you cannot tell us
the truth about Wells. No matter what.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.261
You must keep the timeline intact.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.893
It's gonna be hard to course-correct
if anything gets altered.

08:42.064 --> 08:45.101
So, get what you need, and come back,
preferably to this moment,

08:45.275 --> 08:47.311

or else you might set off

26:24.417 --> 26:26.282
Holy Hany Potter.

26:26.544 --> 26:29.377
Okayl Well, isn't this fantastic?

26:29.547 --> 26:31.583
Look. We're gonna be safe in here,
these cells are—

-(T|ME WRAITH SNARLING)
-(GLASS CRACKING)

26:33.718 --> 26:34.798

26:35.678 --> 26:38.215
Banyl Doctor Wellsl

26:38.389 --> 26:39.424
BARRY: Uh, we have to help them.

26:39.599 --> 26:40.588
You let it track you herel

26:40.808 --> 26:42.309
Get me out of here, come onl

26:42.518 --> 26:45.351
If that thing comes after me
and messes with my plans,

26:45.521 --> 26:46.556
you're all dead!

26:48.232 --> 26:49.347
Where are they?

26:49.525 --> 26:50.856
Okay. Step back.

26:51.694 --> 26:52.683
You'll shatter the glassl

26:52.862 --> 26:53.942
You got a better plan?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.193
As a matter of fact. Give me those.

26:55.364 --> 26:56.615
-(THUDDING)
-Nol

26:56.783 --> 26:58.239
Now, Cisco!

26:59.076 --> 27:00.111
What're you gonna do?

27:00.453 --> 27:02.535
These cells have speakers
linked throughout S.T.A.R. Labs.

27:02.705 --> 27:03.694
Yes, and?

27:03.873 --> 27:06.205
I rigged these gauntlets
to emit a destructive signal

27:06.375 --> 27:07.501
if they were ever disarrned.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.208
{611131331135}

27:09.962 --> 27:13.125
If I can just ﬁnd the right frequency
of whatever the hell that thing is,

27:13.299 --> 27:15.540
well, let's just say you'll be glad
you're in here with me.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.051
-(LOUD BUZZING)
-(SHRIEKING)

27:26.938 --> 27:29.020
(BOTH PANTING)

27:34.821 --> 27:37.187
I'm sony that we didn't come sooner.

27:37.782 --> 27:40.569
It's alright, lnky's gone.
I don't see anything.

27:41.077 --> 27:44.160
You know, we'd be toast if it wasn't
for Hartley and those gauntlets.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.786
Well, self-preservation
is a very strong motivator,

27:45.957 --> 27:47.993
but he stays in the cell
until I say otherwise.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.543
Okay, I'm just saying.

27:49.710 --> 27:52.622
So, the two places the thing
has attacked are here and C.C.P.D.

27:52.797 --> 27:54.412
-The common denominator being—
-Me.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.501
Yeah, I know. ljust... I don't know why.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.212
Well, you must've done something
to piss him off.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.217
Satellite hasn't found anything.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.344
We need to ﬁnd a more permanent solution
to this problem.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.551
Start by repairing Hartley's gauntlets.

28:05.142 --> 28:06.678
That's as good a ﬁrst step as any.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.764
-I got some parts for it.
-Let's go for it.

28:10.398 --> 28:12.263
-You don't know how to stop a Time Wraith?
-None of us do,

28:12.441 --> 28:14.272
that's why we always
try and avoid them in our travels.

28:14.443 --> 28:15.478
-We?
-Speedsters.

28:15.653 --> 28:16.733
We're not the only two
out there, you know.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.019
This isn't the ﬁrst time
I've time-traveled.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.858
How come I've never seen
one of these until now?

28:20.032 --> 28:21.693
Because you ran out of luck.

28:22.285 --> 28:25.618
And Time Wraiths hate it
when speedsters manipulate the timeline,

28:25.788 --> 28:28.951
and now that thing's gonna do
everything it can to end you.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.322
(SCOFFS)

28:31.085 --> 28:32.074
Here's what we're gonna do.

28:32.336 --> 28:34.292
You're gonna go to C.C.P.D.,
you're gonna see what you can ﬁnd

28:34.547 --> 28:36.287
to help us stop this thing,
I'll do the same here.

28:36.591 --> 28:38.001
What am I supposed to be looking for?

28:38.175 --> 28:39.426
You're in forensics, ﬁgure something out.

28:39.594 --> 28:41.960
Hey, but what about the equation?
Me getting faster.

28:42.138 --> 28:43.173
If we don't stop this thing,

28:43.347 --> 28:45.804
there's gonna be no point
in me teaching you anything.

28:51.314 --> 28:53.726
No trace elements, no prints,

28:53.900 --> 28:57.518
no sign that it was ever here,
except the whole mess.

28:57.695 --> 28:59.231
Any idea what it was looking for?

28:59.822 --> 29:01.323
-Me.
-What? Why?

29:01.490 --> 29:03.446
It doesn't like something that I did.

29:03.618 --> 29:05.483
And what exactly would that be?

29:06.329 --> 29:08.490
Joe, Singh needs you in his ofﬁce.

29:12.668 --> 29:13.919
Hey, Eddie. Do you have a second?

29:14.086 --> 29:15.667
I kinda gotta go,
check out a lead for Joe.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.703
Okay, actually,
this is for Iris' birthday.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.876
That's two months from now.

29:20.051 --> 29:22.007
Yeah, no, I know, you're right. ljust...

29:22.178 --> 29:24.260
Um, I wanna make a video montage for her.

29:24.430 --> 29:28.844
Just everybody in her life, and how her
being in your life has made it better.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.054
That sounds great, yeah.
I'll think of something to say.

29:31.228 --> 29:32.968
Can we do it now?

29:33.147 --> 29:34.728
Bany, I really gotta go do this thing.

29:34.899 --> 29:38.812
-I know, I kind of have to get it today.
-Sure.

29:38.986 --> 29:42.069
All right, great.
Just, um, speak from the heart.

29:42.239 --> 29:46.699
Talk as if it was the last thing
you could ever say to her.

29:48.371 --> 29:49.861
Okay.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.451
[m

29:53.626 --> 29:56.834
I'll m m WWII-TH

29:58.089 --> 29:59.670
So, can these gauntlets be salvaged?

29:59.840 --> 30:01.501
Their electron guns are fried.

30:01.676 --> 30:04.213
So, it shorted the wave tubes,
destroyed the ampliﬁers.

30:04.387 --> 30:05.877
Yeah, but, to be honest with you,

30:06.055 --> 30:08.421
I don't know how to manipulate
the frequency variance.

30:08.599 --> 30:11.261
Hartley would know.
He's the one who did it.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.762
See if he can help,
but he stays in the cell.

30:16.941 --> 30:18.477
But then what?
That thing's gonna come back.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.016
I don't know.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.522
human

30:23.948 --> 30:25.154
mmmm1mm

30:27.618 --> 30:28.903
I'm right here.

30:39.088 --> 30:42.546
Okay, not how I expected
today to turn out.

30:42.758 --> 30:43.873
man

30:44.802 --> 30:47.043
-Who are you?
-Who is he? Who are you?

30:47.763 --> 30:51.756
-l'm Bany. I'm Bany. Your Bany. He's...
-Your doppelganger.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.219
No, not yet.

30:54.186 --> 30:58.304
I am you, Bany. Just different.

30:58.482 --> 31:00.859
Wait a second, how do we know
which one's the real Bany?

31:01.277 --> 31:04.189
Dude, okay, I've watched Wrath of Khan
with you, like, ﬁve times.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.443
lmposter.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.605
Yeah, and every time at the end,
you turn to me and you say,

31:07.783 --> 31:09.944
"I have been, and always shall be,
your friend."

31:10.119 --> 31:12.201
Ah-hal You imposter.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.450
What is going on here?

31:15.624 --> 31:18.286
Okay, guys, I'm sony.
This was not supposed to happen.

31:18.461 --> 31:20.827
The tranq dart that Caitlin made
was supposed to last a lot longer.

31:21.005 --> 31:23.121
I did not give him a tranq dart.

31:23.299 --> 31:27.212
Okay, no, yes. Not you.
The you from the time that I'm from.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.471
The time that you're from?

31:29.638 --> 31:33.005
I think what he's trying to say is,
he's from the future.

31:33.184 --> 31:34.219
-The future?
-Yeah.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.475
-The future? Vlhth the...
-Yes. Yes.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.936
Are we saying I can time travel?

31:40.149 --> 31:43.312
(SCOFFING) One day.

31:43.486 --> 31:44.692
Oh, that explains the white on the symbol.

31:45.988 --> 31:48.195
But wait a second,
suppose we now change your emblem?

31:48.365 --> 31:52.108
Vlhll it be because we got the idea from
this, or, I mean, that would mean that—

31:52.286 --> 31:54.698
Stop talking. You stop talking, too.
All right?

31:54.872 --> 31:56.863
The more you say,
the more the timeline is disrupted.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.656
Now, I'm going to assume
that your presence here

31:58.834 --> 32:01.450
-is the reason that thing is attacking us?
-What? What thing?

32:01.629 --> 32:03.165
Have you ever seen The Frighteners?

32:03.339 --> 32:06.797
It's sort of like that, but scarier,
and faster, and it's after you. After him.

32:06.967 --> 32:09.674
Yeah, it's been chasing me
ever since I got here.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.881
-Okay, so how do we stop it?
-We don't know.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.298
-Then what are we gonna do?
-The one thing we can.

32:18.771 --> 32:21.137
What? What are we doing here?

32:22.191 --> 32:26.104
We're here for the answer
to your speed equation.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.736
The reason that you
traveled back to this time.

32:29.907 --> 32:32.899
And the key to running faster.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.619
Tachyon enhancement.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.530
“WRITTEN!

32:40.668 --> 32:43.876
If you think that I'm gonna
hold your hand this entire way,

32:44.046 --> 32:45.081
you're sadly mistaken.

32:45.256 --> 32:47.417
Everything you need is on this drive.

32:47.591 --> 32:48.876
If you follow its instructions,

32:49.051 --> 32:52.339
you will enhance the Speed Force
in your system and run faster

32:53.639 --> 32:55.300
than you ever thought possible.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.471
BARRY: If this doesn't work,

33:01.397 --> 33:02.432
I'm coming back.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.729
CISCO: Doctor Wells, we need you.

33:07.403 --> 33:10.395
Time to go home, Flash.

33:13.993 --> 33:17.702
Okay, our satellite has ﬁnally found
our ﬂoating friend, and it's coming back.

33:17.872 --> 33:19.828
-You need to go.
-I need to know how to stop it.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.739
-Bany.
-Not now.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.908
When I get back,
you guys have a year to ﬁgure it out.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.914
Okay, we'll ﬁgure something out.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.424
Cisco, come here.

33:31.051 --> 33:33.383
Hartley knows where Ronnie is.

33:33.554 --> 33:34.589
Okay. What?

33:36.432 --> 33:38.548
-lt's coming.
-You need to leave, now.

33:57.620 --> 33:58.609
Thank you.

{611131331135}

34:28.734 --> 34:30.565
It's not working, its slowing him down.

34:31.111 --> 34:32.487
Not for long.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.149
No. Banyl

34:38.369 --> 34:40.360

35:00.683 --> 35:03.049
(PANTING) Cool.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.560
-lt's coming.
-Did you even go?

35:14.738 --> 35:16.569
-The Time Wraith.
-That's a good name.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.947
-Looks like that's a "Yes."
-Did you ﬁgure out how to stop it?

35:21.495 --> 35:22.484
{611131331135}

35:24.581 --> 35:26.367
Damn. We thought so.

35:47.229 --> 35:49.265
{611131331135}

35:51.608 --> 35:53.064
I suddenly realized.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.521
Low frequency, high intensity.

35:55.863 --> 35:59.230
-I knew that.
-Oh, hey, Bany. How was your trip?

36:07.416 --> 36:09.998
So, aside from the fact that a Time Wraith

36:10.169 --> 36:12.911
came over here and nearly killed us,
how did it go?

36:13.422 --> 36:14.411
It was interesting.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.876
Good interesting or bad interesting?
'Cause that could go either way.

36:17.051 --> 36:20.009
So far, so good.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.544
(SPEAKING LATIN)

36:22.723 --> 36:24.008
How many times
do we have to tell you, Hartley,

36:24.183 --> 36:26.048
ever since evil Wells
got erased from existence,

36:26.226 --> 36:28.433
no one speaks Latin around here, anymore.

36:28.604 --> 36:32.938
Well, as always, been a pleasure working
with you all on this little project.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.144
If you need anything in the future,
call me.

36:35.486 --> 36:38.319
-l'm off to a late dinner.
-Dinner? Anyone special?

36:39.114 --> 36:40.399
Very.

36:40.574 --> 36:41.780
My parents.

36:44.203 --> 36:46.410
So? You got me on
pins and needles over here.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.992
What about the speed equation?
Did Wells tell you what you need to do?

36:49.458 --> 36:51.494
Well, let's see.

36:58.342 --> 37:02.051
Mmm. Maybe it's password protected?

37:03.889 --> 37:05.595
Are you kidding me?

37:06.183 --> 37:10.768
After everything I just went through,
this doesn't even work.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.779
We got it.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.241
Hey.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.494
-Hey.
-You okay?

37:29.665 --> 37:30.654
Yeah, I'm okay.

37:31.667 --> 37:34.329
Although, it turns out it's easier to ﬁnd
a two-ton gorilla on this Earth

37:34.503 --> 37:35.993
than a teenage daughter.

37:39.716 --> 37:41.001
I don't know what I've done.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.379
You did what you thought you had to do.

37:43.804 --> 37:45.010
You risked your life to save her.

37:45.180 --> 37:47.216
You brought her here
to protect her from Zoom.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.343
I'MEFIHHIWM

37:55.190 --> 37:56.691
You know, my wife had to...

37:56.859 --> 37:58.975
She had to talk me into having kids.

37:59.236 --> 38:03.900
Kids, you know, they're small,
they're loud, run around.

38:04.116 --> 38:08.576
All I needed was my science,
my job, for my joy and happiness.

38:09.663 --> 38:11.028
And then,

38:11.874 --> 38:12.863
(SCOFFS)

38:15.252 --> 38:17.117
the moment we had her,

38:23.093 --> 38:24.208
Now,

38:24.803 --> 38:29.092
I don't know if I'll ever see that again.
It seems every decision I've made lately

38:31.894 --> 38:33.600
You just have to trust that
in the long run,

38:33.770 --> 38:35.101
you've made the right ones.

38:44.198 --> 38:46.109
-Hey.
-IRIS: Hey.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.615
Iput your plate ﬁom dinner
in the fridge.

38:49.578 --> 38:51.114
"mm

39:09.139 --> 39:11.380
It's been almost a year already.
Can you believe that?

39:12.392 --> 39:15.099
That's the thing, Iris.
Everything keeps moving forward.

39:17.397 --> 39:18.728
The question is, when will you?

39:27.199 --> 39:29.190
I don't know, Bany.

39:29.868 --> 39:34.612
Well, um, I found something
that I think might help.

39:36.500 --> 39:41.620
I was putting together this little video
montage for your birthday last year

39:41.797 --> 39:43.412
with everybody and...

39:45.092 --> 39:47.174
Everything happened. Um...

39:48.095 --> 39:52.464
But, uh, take a look.
I think it might help.

39:53.767 --> 39:55.098
Okay.

39:59.314 --> 40:02.351
WM:II'Iu':QIIQIII:I:IIIL'IIII:Y1'Im

40:04.695 --> 40:05.810
You know, a lot of times

40:05.988 --> 40:09.196
I have a hard time
ﬁguring out what to say to people.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.285
But, when it comes to you, Iris, I don't.

40:12.995 --> 40:16.658
Because with you,
everything that used to feel tough

40:17.165 --> 40:18.666
just doesn't anymore.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.499
It's one of the things I love about you.

40:22.337 --> 40:23.713
You don't need me.

40:24.172 --> 40:28.461
You can handle anything on your own,
because you're fearless.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.713
And independent.

40:31.388 --> 40:32.548
Loving.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.432

40:36.476 --> 40:41.846
You are, without question,
the best decision I ever made, Iris West.

40:42.316 --> 40:46.104
And I've never thanked you
for choosing to be with me,

40:46.278 --> 40:50.612
because each day with you is a gift.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.898
So, thank you.

40:53.327 --> 40:54.567
You deserve the world, Iris.

40:54.745 --> 40:56.781
You deserve to be happy
the rest of your life.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.196
And no one wants that more for you
than me.

40:59.791 --> 41:00.780
(SNIFFLING)

41:01.710 --> 41:03.541
Happy birthday, baby.

41:04.546 --> 41:05.911
Ilove you.

41:08.592 --> 41:10.173
I love you, too.

41:16.433 --> 41:17.388
BARRY: Sometimes,
the only way to move fonlvard

41:17.559 --> 41:20.642
is to revisit the things in your past
that were holding you back.

41:21.813 --> 41:26.102
You have to deal with them, head on,
no matter how scary they may be.

41:27.027 --> 41:31.236
Because once you do, you'll see that
you can go further than you ever imagined.

41:37.579 --> 41:39.410
I'm coming for you.
