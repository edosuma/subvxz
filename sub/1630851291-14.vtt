00:01.218 --> 00:04.395
<i>Previously on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

00:04.439 --> 00:07.007
I don't want any more kids,
but Duy come to me and, like,

00:07.050 --> 00:08.617
"I want more kids."
I'm not ready.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.010
Wait. Does Duy really want
more children?

00:10.053 --> 00:11.707
Yes, he wants more kids.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.796
When you sent me the text saying
you're having a faith crisis,

00:13.839 --> 00:17.800
I, like, threw my phone across
the room. I didn't read that!

00:17.843 --> 00:19.410
When Robert and Mary want money,

00:19.454 --> 00:20.933
they call church meetings
together,

00:20.977 --> 00:24.285
and they'll beat you down
until they get what they want.

00:24.328 --> 00:25.590
Is that why you mortgaged
your house?

00:25.634 --> 00:27.897
Yes, that is exactly why
I mortgaged my house.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.900
I thought Lisa was trying to say
something to all of us,

00:30.943 --> 00:33.772
dropping little breadcrumbs
about this Cameron guy.

00:33.816 --> 00:38.951
So I wanted to go to the source,
so I called Cameron.

00:38.995 --> 00:41.345
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

00:41.389 --> 00:43.173
"Real Housewives star charged
in massive fraud

00:43.217 --> 00:45.349
money laundering scheme."
- No!

00:45.393 --> 00:46.437
Honestly,
I just feel so deceived.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.526
We're in this.
We're all deceived.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.528
I just don't think she's
who we think she is.

00:50.572 --> 00:51.790
- I don't know--
- She's not!

00:53.749 --> 00:55.490
"This is Jen.
I tried calling you

00:55.533 --> 00:57.361
to make sure you have
my new number

00:57.405 --> 00:59.102
and to see if we can meet up
for coffee or lunch."

00:59.146 --> 01:00.190
- You should.
- No, John.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.366
I have mixed emotions
about this.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.761
I'm not here to convince Lisa
that I'm innocent

01:05.804 --> 01:07.110
or a good person.

01:07.154 --> 01:10.983
So I want a big ----ing
"I'm sorry"

01:11.027 --> 01:12.724
when I'm proven innocent.

01:31.003 --> 01:33.789
This is starting
to look pretty.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.486
Coming together.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.401
- Hi, Brooks.
- Hey.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.534
Honey, what are your plans
tonight?

01:39.577 --> 01:42.189
Well, I need to finish
this design.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.887
- Do you wanna see it?

01:44.930 --> 01:46.541
Oh, that's chic.

01:46.584 --> 01:51.676
It's like a blazer with, like,
my classic side tape across it.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.764
Nice.

01:56.028 --> 02:00.120
This is supposed to be
a self-portrait of me.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.602
It looks exactly like you,
honey.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.478
Oh, my God. Where is this talent
coming from?

02:11.914 --> 02:13.524
Doesn't this look really good?

02:13.568 --> 02:15.744
My nose looks a little weird.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.137
Hello!
- Hello! How are you?

02:17.180 --> 02:20.444
Oh, my goodness.
You look amazing.

02:20.488 --> 02:21.750
- Hi.
- How you doing?

02:21.793 --> 02:23.578
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.493
- Would you like a drink?
- Sure. What do you have?

02:25.536 --> 02:28.887
I'm drinking
this cucumber-infused vodka,

02:28.931 --> 02:32.195
but then we also have
a berry-based drink as well.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.589
- Did Brooks make this?
- Matthew did.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.895
Matthew did.
- Yes.

02:36.939 --> 02:39.637
Because of all the craziness
that went on in Vail,

02:39.681 --> 02:43.032
I just wanna have
a nice, easy girls night

02:43.075 --> 02:45.339
where you just complain
about your husbands.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.384
Cheers, babe. Yes.

02:47.428 --> 02:50.692
I'm tired of talking
about my friends.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.998
- Are you gonna eat with me?
- Of course, of course.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.174
I feel lonely eating by myself.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.175
I'll have a little something
with you.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.002
Have fun tonight.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.483
- Love you.
- Love you. Bye.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.920
So tell me what's going on.

03:01.964 --> 03:04.314
Nothing much.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.316
There was so much going on
in Vail.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.709
I completely forgot to ask you.

03:07.752 --> 03:11.147
How is it going with this
whole fourth child issue?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.671
It's still going.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.065
He told me,
"Well, okay, I understand

03:16.108 --> 03:19.547
you don't want any more kids,
and you're not able.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.070
Surrogate mom
is out of the question.

03:21.113 --> 03:23.333
Adoption is out of the question,

03:23.377 --> 03:25.379
so what about a sister wife?"

03:25.422 --> 03:26.684
- Wait.
- What the hell?

03:26.728 --> 03:28.512
- Out of the blue?
- Out of the blue!

03:28.556 --> 03:31.515
Why don't we get a sister wife?

03:31.559 --> 03:34.257
- Are you serious right now?
- I'm dead serious.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.780
Like, sitting there--

03:35.824 --> 03:37.173
And this is nothing you've ever
talking about before.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.696
No, like, the first time.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.742
I was like, what...

03:40.785 --> 03:42.483
I mean, how do you respond
to that, Meredith?

03:42.526 --> 03:45.616
I mean, that's intense.
I-I could not do that.

03:45.660 --> 03:52.275
There's no way I could live
with another woman co-wifeing.

03:52.319 --> 03:56.888
That's, like--I-I would be
fighting with her all day long.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.674
And he told me, like,
it's legal since last year.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.502
- What do you want?

04:01.545 --> 04:03.939
-"No one's talking to me."

04:05.375 --> 04:08.073
"I wanna talk to somebody."
Right.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.996
- Hey.
- Hello.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.476
- Well, hello, girl!
- Are you ready to party?

04:19.520 --> 04:21.783
- Hello.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.611
- How are you?

04:23.654 --> 04:26.091
Hey, Teddy, you love me.
Teddy, you love me.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.615
Hi, Lisa!

04:27.658 --> 04:30.792
- Hey, what's up, Jennie?
- Oh, my gosh. Check you out.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.315
Ooh. Well, you have food.
We're not gonna be anorexic.

04:32.359 --> 04:35.144
I think we're happy.
Can I get you a drink?

04:35.187 --> 04:36.972
Um, I would love one.
What are you guys drinking?

04:37.015 --> 04:39.104
- We have this, like...
- Want a cucumber?

04:39.148 --> 04:41.759
- Cucumber or this, like...
- Oh, my gosh, Mers.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.936
Rosemary blackberry.
Which one would you...

04:44.980 --> 04:46.373
Ooh. Cucumber.
I'm feeling green.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.765
Then I won't have a headache.
Come here.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.420
We're all green.
- Mm, good to see you.

04:50.464 --> 04:51.769
Good to see you.
I haven't seen you for a while.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.032
- I know. Oh, my gosh.
- How is your business?

04:54.076 --> 04:56.034
Good. You know what?
It's just been nuts.

04:56.078 --> 04:59.690
Like, the last three days,
I feel like is insanity.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.476
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.087
Are you excited
about your pho lunch?

05:05.130 --> 05:08.482
I know. I can't wait, girl.

05:08.525 --> 05:09.439
I think it's great
that Jennie's trying

05:09.483 --> 05:11.311
to get us together for pho,

05:11.354 --> 05:14.531
because it seems like a lot
of our friendships are faux.

05:14.575 --> 05:15.619
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:15.663 --> 05:16.968
- To us.
- To us!

05:17.012 --> 05:18.579
To us. Yes!

05:18.622 --> 05:20.755
I don't know how it's gonna go
with the other girls

05:20.798 --> 05:22.974
since they flew home commercial.

05:23.018 --> 05:25.629
- There's a Delta flight.
- At what time?

05:25.673 --> 05:26.587
6.

05:26.630 --> 05:27.805
Jennie and I were just sort of

05:27.849 --> 05:30.417
having a follow-up conversation...

05:30.460 --> 05:32.636
- From the fish spa.
- The fish spa.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.159
Did you tell Lisa this yet
or no?

05:34.203 --> 05:36.771
- No, what? Tell me.
- You know, Duy want more kids.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.382
- I mentioned that to you.
- Yeah.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.819
- Guess what he brought up.
- What?

05:41.863 --> 05:43.125
A sister wife.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.953
Wow.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.433
It hurts a lot.

05:46.476 --> 05:50.132
I feel like...
just knowing you guys,

05:50.175 --> 05:55.050
I would never in a million years
expect Duy to contemplate that.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.225
Yeah.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.835
He just seems so in love
with you.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.447
Mm-hmm. This is, like,
the last thing I expected

06:00.490 --> 06:02.187
to come out of his mouth.

06:02.231 --> 06:05.582
If John asked for a sister wife,
John wouldn't need a sister wife

06:05.626 --> 06:09.151
because he wouldn't have
a first wife.

06:09.194 --> 06:11.501
Sister wives or no sister wives,

06:11.545 --> 06:13.895
I think you need to have
a little fun tonight.

06:15.897 --> 06:18.116
Tell Duy I'm gonna help you
find a brother husband.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.380
- Sure.
- You need a Scorpio like John.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.386
You guys have, like,
a good sex life.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.388
- You're happy with it.
- I'm happy.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.041
So what, do you dress up?

06:30.085 --> 06:32.870
- You play a character?
- I mean, we have.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.350
Who hasn't at some point?
I haven't.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.657
- Never?
- No!

06:36.700 --> 06:39.616
Jennie, we might have solved
your problem tonight.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.096
Maybe there will be
no more sister wife

06:41.139 --> 06:44.752
after we re-outfit you.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.797
- Look, we have, Jennie--
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.930
- Do you have any wigs?
- Yes.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.588
Oh, my gosh.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.938
Why wouldn't I have
a blonde wig on hand?

06:56.981 --> 06:58.505
<i>â™ª Gonna make your booty shake</i>

07:02.465 --> 07:04.336
I love it.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.512
Aah!

07:07.035 --> 07:10.473
Damn! I look like a hooker.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.780
Look at this, Jennie!

07:32.321 --> 07:34.149
<i>-Hello.
- Hey, girl.</i>

07:34.192 --> 07:35.498
<i>Hey, girl, what's up?</i>

07:35.542 --> 07:37.500
I'm just doing all kinds
of things today.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.589
I'm driving myself.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.504
<i>-What?!
- Yeah.</i>

07:41.548 --> 07:43.114
<i>-What?
- I...</i>

07:47.205 --> 07:50.905
Girl, by the way, um,
you know, I...

07:50.948 --> 07:52.602
after I met with you for lunch,

07:52.646 --> 07:55.649
I called Lisa a few times,

07:55.692 --> 07:57.868
sent her texts to make sure
she had my number,

07:57.912 --> 08:00.654
and then sent another text
saying,

08:00.697 --> 08:05.267
"Hey, um, just tried
calling you again.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.834
Wanted to know
when you're available to chat

08:06.877 --> 08:08.531
or meet up for coffee
or something,"

08:08.575 --> 08:12.970
and finally, four days later,
just got a text,

08:13.014 --> 08:15.886
and it says,
"I can meet up today."

08:17.932 --> 08:19.324
Yeah. I need some real talk,
girl.

08:19.368 --> 08:22.066
Like, please.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.771
Absolutely.

08:30.814 --> 08:33.643
- I love you. <i>
- Love you.</i>

08:33.687 --> 08:36.080
Lisa and I talked
on a daily basis

08:36.124 --> 08:41.216
probably for an average
of 3.2 hours a day.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.434
I'm not even playing.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.655
Hi. How are you?

08:45.699 --> 08:47.178
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.658
- Can I get a table for two?
- Yeah.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.705
So to have somebody
that I talk to

08:51.748 --> 08:58.842
more than anybody in my life
go MIA on me?

08:58.886 --> 09:04.282
I-I-I don't understand
what's going on.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.249
- Hi. Welcome to Carson Kitchen.
- Hey.

09:14.292 --> 09:18.209
I'm just meeting a friend.
Thank you.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.559
Hey, Jen Shah.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.519
<i>Coming up...</i>

09:23.563 --> 09:26.000
Because of your decision
to leave Mormonism,

09:26.043 --> 09:27.958
I have made a similar choice.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.221
And my problem is I feel like

09:30.265 --> 09:32.572
I raised my kids...

09:32.615 --> 09:34.965
in a cult.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.670
Thank you.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.846
Hi. How are you?

09:45.889 --> 09:50.764
Um, I'm doing... I'm doing
as good as I can be right now.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.378
Can I start you two
with something to drink

09:56.421 --> 09:57.684
while you're getting started?
- You know what?

09:57.727 --> 09:59.250
- Can I just get some water?
- Just some water?

09:59.294 --> 10:00.512
- Water with lemon, please.
- Water with lemon? No problem.

10:00.556 --> 10:02.732
Thank you.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.562
Do you wanna start off with,
like, the crispy chicken skin?

10:06.606 --> 10:07.824
- Oh, yeah.
- It'd be perfect

10:07.868 --> 10:09.434
for, like, dipping. 'Kay.
- Yeah, perfect.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.219
- I'll get those in for you.
- Thank you.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.569
- Thank you, sure. How are you?
- Um...

10:16.528 --> 10:17.617
Um...

10:17.660 --> 10:21.185
- It's been hard. It's been...
- Yeah.

10:21.229 --> 10:23.666
...hard on, not just me,
but--but my family,

10:23.710 --> 10:27.539
and that's the part
that hurts me the most,

10:27.583 --> 10:29.585
especially when you're innocent
and you didn't do anything.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.239
Well, just so you know,
I'm like, you know,

10:31.282 --> 10:34.285
I--You're innocent,
you know what I mean?

10:34.329 --> 10:36.374
Like, they have to prove,
you know what I mean?

10:36.418 --> 10:38.115
So I'm looking at you
as innocent.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.465
Like, I hope you don't get that
from me.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.469
- Thank you.
- All I need right now is

10:44.513 --> 10:46.558
for my friends and loved ones
to be there for me

10:46.602 --> 10:51.172
because this whole thing
is crazy, and, like,

10:51.215 --> 10:53.304
this whole experience has
kind of showed me, like,

10:53.348 --> 10:55.350
who my real friends are.

10:55.393 --> 10:59.310
After a lot of conversations
with John,

10:59.354 --> 11:01.748
he was like, "Normally,
you would be the first one

11:01.791 --> 11:03.924
to run and call Jen,
to be there at her side.

11:03.967 --> 11:07.623
This is not you.
You need to go meet with Jen."

11:07.667 --> 11:10.104
And I thought about what
he said, and he was right.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.584
Taking this time to process
doesn't make me a bad friend.

11:12.628 --> 11:15.326
It makes me real and not a fake.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.850
And actually I think it's right
for Jen,

11:16.893 --> 11:18.721
because I'm in a better space

11:18.765 --> 11:20.767
to have a good conversation
with her.

11:20.810 --> 11:24.727
You know, um, I took a little
bit to get back to you

11:24.771 --> 11:27.295
because I have to, like,
think through things

11:27.338 --> 11:30.080
'cause my feelings are hurt
on some stuff.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.171
If your feelings are hurt, Lisa,

11:34.215 --> 11:37.392
I...never knew your feelings
were hurt.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.960
I mean, I haven't really talked
to you much since, like,

11:40.003 --> 11:41.570
my kids' party.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.355
I see getting gifts
from our friend group

11:44.399 --> 11:45.313
on social media.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.489
It was all a ----ing setup!

11:47.532 --> 11:48.969
Well, I don't really
wanna talk about this.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.841
Well, you brought it up! Why?!
Why?! I wanna know why.

11:51.885 --> 11:56.933
I'm still, like, like,
where am I with Jen?

11:59.675 --> 12:01.808
Screw whatever happened
before Vail.

12:01.851 --> 12:05.768
Hello! Like, come on. I think
this supersedes and overrides

12:05.812 --> 12:08.466
anything that happened
before Vail, okay?

12:08.510 --> 12:11.078
I know I've been your friend.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.253
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

12:12.296 --> 12:16.561
And, like, I think, um...

12:20.740 --> 12:22.916
When you came at me that hard,

12:22.959 --> 12:26.876
I felt very broken by you.

12:26.920 --> 12:31.098
And I couldn't sleep.
I was up the whole night,

12:31.141 --> 12:33.404
and I still had to be a mom.
I still had to work.

12:33.448 --> 12:36.581
And I'm, like, emotionally
----ing wrecked.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.714
But I am, too.
I'm still a mom. I still work.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.585
But it's okay that
you're feeling that way,

12:40.629 --> 12:43.110
but I was feeling that way, too.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.242
Does it make sense?

12:45.286 --> 12:46.983
Do you understand where
I'm coming from?

12:47.027 --> 12:48.289
Can you...

12:48.332 --> 12:50.073
Abso--I understand where
you're coming from,

12:50.117 --> 12:55.557
but, Lisa, that set aside,
when sh-- implodes...

12:55.600 --> 12:58.038
nothing else matters.

12:58.081 --> 13:01.563
This is the lowest point
of my life, and you go silent?

13:01.606 --> 13:02.869
- I'm not going silent.
- You have!

13:02.912 --> 13:04.827
- I'm here today.
- I have reached out to you!

13:04.871 --> 13:07.656
Jen, I'm here today.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.746
And I've been there for you
for the last nine months,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.226
more than anybody else
has been there for you.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.793
I have been there for you.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.012
So was it real? Because this is
when I really need you.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.666
Jen, oh, my God. Yes, it's real.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.929
- No, but this is when I real--
- No, no, you know what?

13:19.973 --> 13:22.062
Sometimes it's unpopular
in our friend group

13:22.105 --> 13:25.021
that I'm, like, totally, like,
"Jen, Jen, Jen."

13:25.065 --> 13:26.718
If it's unpopular for you
to be friends with me,

13:26.762 --> 13:28.242
don't be friends with me.
I'm not here--

13:28.285 --> 13:30.548
No, but that's the point.

13:30.592 --> 13:31.985
That's the point you're missing.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.160
I'm not here to force you.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.465
You said it to me
at my kids' photo shoot.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.598
"I know you take heat
being friends with me."

13:36.641 --> 13:38.513
I have never complained
about that.

13:38.556 --> 13:39.427
I have never brought that up
to you, and I don't--

13:39.470 --> 13:41.081
That's how you made me feel.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.734
Jen, I have had your ----ing
back for the last nine months.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.736
And I've had your ----ing back
before we were even friends.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.955
Same. Same. Same.
And you know why?

13:45.999 --> 13:47.565
Okay, and I've always
felt like that.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.089
- Same, exact same.
- So what's the problem, Lisa?

13:49.132 --> 13:50.786
There isn't a problem. Like,
when I didn't call you,

13:50.830 --> 13:52.179
it's because my feelings
were still hurt,

13:52.222 --> 13:54.746
because I actually have
----ing feelings, too.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.576
Does it suck for Jen
that she's going through this?

13:58.620 --> 14:02.276
100%. But it doesn't minimize
what she did to me prior

14:02.319 --> 14:04.844
and how I was feeling prior.

14:04.887 --> 14:08.717
I am allowed to feel this way.
I am allowed to process.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.284
Do I wish this on Jen? No.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.286
But does Jen
have the right to say

14:12.329 --> 14:13.809
whatever the she wants

14:13.853 --> 14:16.856
to whoever she says it to?
Absolutely not.

14:16.899 --> 14:20.207
I reached out to everybody.
Heather was the first person.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.992
She was like, "I'm here for you.

14:23.036 --> 14:26.735
What do you need? I'll meet you
as soon as possible."

14:26.778 --> 14:28.606
She answered the phone
in my greatest time of need

14:28.650 --> 14:32.480
when I reached out to you.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.308
I don't care about anything.

14:34.351 --> 14:37.137
I'm trying to fight for
my ----ing freedom and my life

14:37.180 --> 14:38.660
and my kids...

14:38.703 --> 14:39.922
- I hear you. I'm--
-...and my family.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.011
I hear you. I understand,
and you know what?

14:42.055 --> 14:43.491
- I think for me--
- And so why wouldn't you

14:43.534 --> 14:45.754
just pick up the phone?

14:45.797 --> 14:51.020
Um... Jen, I'm--Jen. Jen.
I am sorry.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.109
I needed--I needed a minute.

14:53.153 --> 14:57.984
It's not about your time.
It's about if I need something--

14:58.027 --> 14:59.942
or my family,
like, I call you first.

14:59.986 --> 15:03.859
Okay, listen, listen, listen,
I hate seeing you cry.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.948
I call you first.
Do you understand that?

15:05.992 --> 15:08.255
- Okay, listen, again--
- I call you first.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.257
No, Jen, nobody knows how
to handle these situations.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.041
Nobody knows. Nobody knows.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.825
Like, you don't know.
I don't know.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.697
I know, but my family
and my friends

15:15.740 --> 15:18.047
I expect to be there.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.528
I never thought
Lisa would be the one

15:20.571 --> 15:22.617
who wouldn't pick up my call.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.010
How do I trust her
going forward?

15:24.053 --> 15:28.623
It makes me feel like
she's not gonna be somebody

15:28.666 --> 15:30.930
that I am, you know,
looking to call,

15:30.973 --> 15:35.325
because this entire experience
has proven to me

15:35.369 --> 15:37.980
and shown me she's actually
a fair-weather friend

15:38.024 --> 15:42.028
and...is not gonna be here
for me.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.117
What do you need now?
I don't know. I don't--

15:44.160 --> 15:45.596
I need support from my friends
and family.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.469
Okay, but how do you--
how do you need support?

15:48.512 --> 15:49.731
Like, how do you need it?

15:49.774 --> 15:53.387
To be there for me.
Just be there.

15:59.262 --> 16:00.611
<i>Coming up...</i>

16:00.655 --> 16:02.744
The thing that scares me
is rumors are that

16:02.787 --> 16:04.746
Mary and Robert are predators.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.401
- What?
- Yeah. It's online.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.849
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

16:20.892 --> 16:21.719
Like you've turned it
into your own little home.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.199
Yeah.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.985
Are you uncomfortable
with the pink daisy sheets?

16:26.028 --> 16:27.203
Mostly everything we have
in this house

16:27.247 --> 16:29.553
is pink, unfortunately.
- No, it's great.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.384
- Do you wanna play a game?
- Absolutely.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.386
- Okay.
- That's like a favorite pastime.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.388
I know. Let's play a game.
I just gotta find it.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.652
As long as you don't cry
when you lose.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.045
I'm the middle of six kids.

16:43.089 --> 16:46.048
It goes girl, boy, girl,
girl, boy, boy.

16:46.092 --> 16:49.051
Tyler's my older brother.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.010
He always had
the older cooler friends.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.055
He had to forge the pass
with my parents...

16:53.099 --> 16:55.057
- What did you get?
- A 9.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.973
I got a 12.
So these I will lay down.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.931
...and really was
an example for me

16:59.975 --> 17:01.585
always growing up,

17:01.629 --> 17:04.153
and then he moved
with his wife to Switzerland,

17:04.197 --> 17:05.807
and he's been raising
his two boys there

17:05.850 --> 17:07.809
for the last 15 years.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.420
So I got your letter.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.553
And I know I didn't respond
immediately because

17:12.596 --> 17:14.250
you said you wrote a letter
'cause of--you--

17:14.294 --> 17:15.817
I just wanted to get it out.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.427
The word you used
was "gravitas."

17:17.471 --> 17:18.211
You said, "For the gravitas
of what I'm about to say,

17:18.254 --> 17:19.864
I'm using a letter form."

17:19.908 --> 17:23.564
I just wanted to let you know
that because of your decision

17:23.607 --> 17:26.306
to leave Mormonism,

17:26.349 --> 17:28.264
I had made a similar choice.

17:28.308 --> 17:32.094
When did you make that choice?

17:32.138 --> 17:34.444
Because when I saw you
last April,

17:34.488 --> 17:36.098
you were,
for all intents and purposes,

17:36.142 --> 17:38.187
a true believing Mormon.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.710
Right before Christmas.

17:39.754 --> 17:44.019
After hearing about what you had
come to the conclusion,

17:44.063 --> 17:45.238
I said, well,
I'd better look into this,

17:45.281 --> 17:48.458
because I-I trust <i>you.</i>

17:48.502 --> 17:52.201
And so that's a spark for me
to get me moving.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.943
When I decided to not practice
Mormonism anymore,

17:54.986 --> 17:56.771
I didn't tell a soul,

17:56.814 --> 17:59.730
and the last person
I would've told was my brother.

17:59.774 --> 18:03.821
Like, I literally went
to his home in Zurich.

18:03.865 --> 18:06.389
They had every single doctrine
and law of the Mormon Church.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.695
Like, they were living it.

18:07.738 --> 18:10.219
They did family home meeting
every Monday.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.656
They, during COVID,
did Zoom church for three hours

18:12.700 --> 18:16.399
in German with their children
in church clothes.

18:16.443 --> 18:21.274
I looked up some information
about... Joseph Smith

18:21.317 --> 18:24.973
and, like, how many--
- First mistake.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.409
- Yeah, first freaking mistake.
- It's the first rule.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.758
That's the first rule
of being Mormon.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.325
- You don't look up anything.
- He married a--

18:29.369 --> 18:32.546
And, like, he married
a 14-year-old.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.550
That's weird.
They don't teach that at church.

18:36.593 --> 18:39.770
- Why is that?
- And that's the problem.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.990
So you feel like you were duped?

18:42.033 --> 18:43.470
Yeah, I kinda do.
Sometimes I do.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.820
I'm, like, all over the place.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.779
We'd always been taught not
to look at anything anti

18:48.823 --> 18:50.303
because that was like
a tool of the devil

18:50.346 --> 18:52.783
to lead us astray
from the Church.

18:52.827 --> 18:56.047
It would have been a betrayal,
and there's just no in between.

18:56.091 --> 18:59.138
You're either a faithful member

18:59.181 --> 19:03.359
or...you're against the Church.

19:03.403 --> 19:07.189
I'm in a trauma still.
I'm angry some days.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.887
And some days
I'm just thrilled to be out,

19:09.931 --> 19:13.413
and some days I feel like...

19:15.110 --> 19:18.200
Like I've saved my children.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.725
Saved 'em.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.207
And my problem is I feel like...

19:27.688 --> 19:30.212
I raised my kids...

19:32.345 --> 19:34.869
...in a cult.

19:36.784 --> 19:41.005
That makes me de facto
a bad parent.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.447
But one thing
about my letter,

19:47.490 --> 19:51.494
I was actually a bit sad
that you didn't call me.

19:54.105 --> 19:58.414
'Cause I felt
like I really needed you then.

19:58.458 --> 20:02.853
I know. I'm sorry.

20:02.897 --> 20:05.595
And I just felt like
I could've used you, and--

20:05.639 --> 20:08.424
I know, but I read it,
and I-I felt--

20:08.468 --> 20:11.906
I read it, and I thought,
I-I can't...

20:11.949 --> 20:14.256
I can't celebrate this with him.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.649
I know.

20:15.692 --> 20:16.650
It was kind of like
a confirmation

20:16.693 --> 20:18.391
of my biggest fears.
- Yeah.

20:18.434 --> 20:21.002
Like, I never told anyone
anything I was struggling with

20:21.045 --> 20:24.223
because I didn't want to affect
anyone's faith.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.355
- I know.
- And it came right on the heels

20:26.399 --> 20:29.837
of Caroline texting me, and then
you wrote me the letter,

20:29.880 --> 20:31.273
and then I got a lot of people
emailing me...

20:31.317 --> 20:32.796
- I know.
-...saying, like,

20:32.840 --> 20:34.798
"We're leaving the Church.
Like, you spoke to our hearts.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.365
Like, everything you said
made us know

20:36.409 --> 20:37.975
that what we believe
isn't true," and I thought--

20:38.019 --> 20:40.021
That's your worst nightmare.

20:40.064 --> 20:45.287
It's really hard to be
a role model and be a traitor

20:45.331 --> 20:46.810
at the same time.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.159
I would have loved

20:48.203 --> 20:49.857
to have just lived in my bubble
my whole life.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.294
I just would have loved to have
had it all work out for me

20:52.338 --> 20:55.428
like I had been promised,
you know?

20:55.471 --> 20:58.344
I don't think I'm better off

20:58.387 --> 21:01.651
because I've realized something,
you know?

21:01.695 --> 21:06.656
I-I grieve the life
I wanted to have.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.311
I never once said that--that you
need to leave the Church.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.834
I never once said,
"Don't be Mormon."

21:10.878 --> 21:13.533
I just said, "I can't be me
and be Mormon,"

21:13.576 --> 21:18.189
and that's making me messed up,
you know?

21:18.233 --> 21:21.236
I wish I could be who I am
and still be a good Mormon.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.324
- Of course you do.
- Just to honor Dad

21:22.368 --> 21:23.760
and just to honor our family.
- I know.

21:23.804 --> 21:26.154
And just to not screw up
everybody.

21:26.197 --> 21:29.679
I don't wanna lay it on you.
It's not your fault.

21:29.723 --> 21:32.552
You've saved my family.
You haven't ruined anything.

21:54.835 --> 21:57.185
Please forgive us
for our shortcomings.

21:58.404 --> 22:01.189
All praises to God.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.715
All praises to God.

22:05.759 --> 22:09.197
- All praise to God.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.720
It's the last day of Ramadan,

22:10.764 --> 22:14.594
and Ramadan is
the most blessed month

22:14.637 --> 22:17.945
of the Islamic faith.

22:17.988 --> 22:21.035
During Ramadan, for 30 days,
we fast from sunup to sundown.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.472
It humbles your soul.
It makes you reflect

22:23.516 --> 22:25.735
and think and be appreciative

22:25.779 --> 22:28.782
for the things that you take
for granted.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.218
Allah, we bear witness
and testify

22:30.261 --> 22:32.307
that there's none worthy
of worship except for Allah,

22:32.351 --> 22:34.962
and give us peace
in this turmoil.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.572
Give us tranquility.

22:36.616 --> 22:40.097
Allow our hearts
not to worry or grieve.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.883
Please bless and protect Jen,

22:42.926 --> 22:45.755
things that are said
against her that crush her soul.

22:45.799 --> 22:48.497
But, Allah, we put all of
our trust and faith in you.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.369
We put all of our trust
and faith in you.

22:53.720 --> 22:57.114
Now let's go eat.
Let's go eat.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.942
The fact that I'm going through
the most difficult time

22:58.986 --> 23:03.556
of my entire life,
and Ramadan is happening,

23:03.599 --> 23:05.427
I'm looking at this
as a blessing.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.082
I need this right now.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.954
Go eat, go eat. Go eat.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.956
This is a blessing.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.523
Get you some plates.
Let's get it.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.960
I'm about to go change
real fast. I'll be right back.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.920
I'm gonna take this off.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.491
Okay.

23:33.890 --> 23:36.980
- Man. I'm happy now.
- Thank you for cooking, baby.

23:37.024 --> 23:38.547
Ohh.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.375
I'm happy we could all
pray together, too.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.334
No, it was a blessing.

23:43.378 --> 23:44.945
I know we said we're gonna
talk about, you know, things

23:44.988 --> 23:46.425
as they come up,

23:46.468 --> 23:49.558
and so what we have to begin
to do is

23:49.602 --> 23:52.474
think about making a move,

23:52.518 --> 23:54.345
and it has to be quick.

23:54.389 --> 23:58.741
I need to get us a place where
we can get a smaller spot.

23:58.785 --> 24:01.222
We don't have to pay as much

24:01.265 --> 24:05.966
and think about conserving
because the most important thing

24:06.009 --> 24:09.099
is being able to fight
for your freedom.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.016
<i>Coming up...</i>

24:13.060 --> 24:14.540
Walking and praying.
Walking and praying.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.194
- Is that Jen?
-...like innate and natural?

24:17.238 --> 24:18.369
I believe so.

24:18.413 --> 24:21.372
Didn't we all have
this conversation

24:21.416 --> 24:24.027
not to invite me
if you invited her?

24:32.688 --> 24:33.950
We can get a smaller spot

24:33.994 --> 24:37.127
where we don't have
to pay as much,

24:37.171 --> 24:40.566
and think about conserving
because the most important thing

24:40.609 --> 24:43.743
is being able to fight
for your freedom.

24:43.786 --> 24:50.010
I guess I'm just, like, still
worried about, you know...

24:50.053 --> 24:54.405
I don't know,
downsizing.

24:54.449 --> 24:58.845
Our home is where so many people
come and consider home,

24:58.888 --> 25:02.326
not only our boys
but our extended family,

25:02.370 --> 25:04.415
our nieces, nephews, parents.

25:04.459 --> 25:08.071
Like, our home is a hub
for both sides of our family.

25:08.115 --> 25:10.944
And so us changing that,

25:10.987 --> 25:15.209
I just felt like
I failed my dad and grandpa,

25:15.252 --> 25:17.080
and when they passed
and they were, like,

25:17.124 --> 25:19.126
"Okay, take care of everybody,"

25:19.169 --> 25:21.041
so I wanted to try
to go through this

25:21.084 --> 25:23.565
without having to change things,

25:23.609 --> 25:25.959
not just for me
but for everybody else.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.351
Okay.

25:27.395 --> 25:30.180
I employ the vast majority
of my family.

25:30.224 --> 25:33.314
It's probably somewhere upwards
- of 50
- K a month.

25:33.357 --> 25:37.231
I've told them, "Move here.
Move to Salt Lake City, Utah.

25:37.274 --> 25:41.191
I'll help you get on your feet,
get a better life

25:41.235 --> 25:45.369
for you and your family,"
and--and then this happens.

25:45.413 --> 25:48.590
I mean,
the legal fees are,

25:48.634 --> 25:50.940
I'm thinking a million at first
and then

25:50.984 --> 25:52.855
it's looking like
it's gonna be $2 million.

25:52.899 --> 25:55.292
Right now none of that matters.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.250
We're going against
the behemoth

25:56.293 --> 25:57.817
that's the federal government,

25:57.860 --> 26:02.909
and they're wrong, and we have
to prove that they're wrong.

26:02.952 --> 26:05.781
But we need the resources
to do it.

26:05.825 --> 26:09.611
That's what we have to do.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.831
The scariest thing to me
is, like, is this...

26:11.874 --> 26:15.617
could this be the last Ramadan
I have with my family?

26:15.661 --> 26:18.925
Am I gonna see Rieffy
go to medical school?

26:18.968 --> 26:21.623
Am I gonna see Omar graduate?

26:21.667 --> 26:26.323
This is the sh--
that keeps me up at night.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.543
I don't understand any of this
because...

26:34.114 --> 26:37.639
Anybody that knows me knows...

26:37.683 --> 26:40.555
I...this...this isn't me.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.646
The things that I've been
accused of, it's--it's not me.

26:46.082 --> 26:48.041
Thanks, honey.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.918
- Love you.
- I love you.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.766
- Hi! Welcome.
- Thank you. How are you?

27:17.810 --> 27:19.986
Good. I'm Blake
with Park City Yoga Adventures.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.683
Hey. I have a friend meeting me.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.467
- Okay.
- She should be here shortly.

27:23.511 --> 27:24.817
- Is she right behind you?
- Yeah.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.210
- You wanna check it out? Cool.
- Yeah, definitely.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.954
Welcome to the Homestead Crater.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.828
Wow, this looks amazing.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.221
Caribbean blue.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.832
- I like it.
- 96 degrees year round.

27:42.443 --> 27:45.054
So am I gonna have to get
my hair wet?

27:45.098 --> 27:46.708
- Well...it is part of the fun.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.406
There's no reason Whitney
and I should have any problems,

27:49.450 --> 27:52.714
and I've put a lot of effort
into trying

27:52.758 --> 27:55.674
to make this friendship work,
but we take two steps forward,

27:55.717 --> 27:58.589
and she brings us
three paces back.

27:58.633 --> 27:59.808
And at this point, I'm like,
well, maybe we can go

27:59.852 --> 28:02.593
to a Zen place
and actually work this out.

28:02.637 --> 28:04.857
- Hi, Lisa.
- How are you?

28:04.900 --> 28:06.989
I'm good. This is such
an unexpected surprise.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.210
Surprise!

28:13.430 --> 28:15.737
- You look a little nervous.
- What are we doing?

28:15.781 --> 28:17.260
- We're gonna--
- Paddleboard yoga.

28:18.348 --> 28:20.133
I know what the Crater is.

28:20.176 --> 28:21.308
This is
a never-ending body of water,

28:21.351 --> 28:24.050
and Lisa's invited me here
to work out.

28:24.093 --> 28:25.007
All right, should we get
on the water?

28:25.051 --> 28:26.095
Yeah, let's do it.

28:26.139 --> 28:27.706
Like, I do have a history
of people

28:27.749 --> 28:29.882
threatening to drown me
in bodies of water.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.101
Roll your ----ing eyes and look
over there one more time,

28:32.145 --> 28:33.842
I will drown you, bitch.

28:33.886 --> 28:35.583
Is this a setup?

28:35.626 --> 28:36.758
All right, so we're gonna start

28:36.802 --> 28:39.500
with a few moments
of mindfulness.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.197
Just sit up nice and tall
and close your eyes.

28:41.241 --> 28:45.158
And then up overhead,
reaching tall.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.333
Now on the exhale,
hands come together

28:46.376 --> 28:48.639
and slide down the center
of your body.

28:48.683 --> 28:51.947
Left hand out in front,
right foot behind.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.083
<i>- Aah!</i>

28:59.650 --> 29:01.609
Back to Warrior 2.
Nice and slow.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.611
Aah!

29:04.655 --> 29:06.527
Whoa!

29:07.528 --> 29:09.791
There you go. Oh, nice job!

29:09.835 --> 29:10.879
I'm going over!

29:11.967 --> 29:14.622
Nice.

29:16.145 --> 29:18.452
I actually think exercising
with Lisa

29:18.495 --> 29:20.628
is the best activity
for her and I.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.412
Good. Anytime.

29:22.456 --> 29:24.284
Because there's minimal talking,

29:24.327 --> 29:26.286
and she's getting endorphins,
so she's happy.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.157
- That was fun.

29:28.201 --> 29:30.029
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.074
I'm gonna stay in the water.

29:32.118 --> 29:35.599
Well, I thought it would be good
for us to talk after Vail

29:35.643 --> 29:36.949
because we didn't get
the chance to.

29:36.992 --> 29:41.475
Like, I felt like everything
ended so abruptly.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.825
- I hated how it ended.
- It was bad.

29:43.869 --> 29:47.873
I believe that she saw
a sever in our relationship

29:47.916 --> 29:50.136
so she can use you against me
for her gain.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.051
No, that is
so beyond ridiculous.

29:52.094 --> 29:53.487
Like, that's offensive.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.402
The whole thing was negative,
you know?

29:55.445 --> 29:57.752
Well, it's hard for me because

29:57.796 --> 29:59.885
the night before
we were all saying stuff,

29:59.928 --> 30:02.931
and then everyone just did
a complete 180.

30:02.975 --> 30:05.194
In my perspective,
it was a flip-flop.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.284
You know what? I'll further
elaborate on that, too.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.286
So I went in her room,
and I'm like,

30:10.330 --> 30:13.159
"Mary, I read things. I just
have a few questions for you,

30:13.202 --> 30:14.551
and I might have more."

30:14.595 --> 30:17.554
And I'm like,
"I just need to know, like,

30:17.598 --> 30:20.166
do you or any--does anyone at
your church think you're God?"

30:22.342 --> 30:23.865
She vehemently said no.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.389
and then I asked her
a few other questions,

30:26.433 --> 30:28.652
and, like, I kept that light,
though, and I told her--

30:28.696 --> 30:30.176
I'm like, "I might have
more questions for you."

30:30.219 --> 30:31.699
Did you bring up
the Cameron stuff to her?

30:31.742 --> 30:33.657
I did bring up Cameron's stuff
a little bit.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.703
Then I go, "Does it bother you?"
And she's like,

30:35.746 --> 30:37.705
"People have been talking
about my church for 30 years."

30:37.748 --> 30:39.707
You know, I asked her
some other things--

30:39.750 --> 30:41.752
little things that Cameron
has told me,

30:41.796 --> 30:43.972
because I just wanted to hear
what she says.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.845
I believe Cameron.
Just to make this clear,

30:46.888 --> 30:49.804
I 100% believe what Cameron
tells me.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.111
Well, listen, Lisa,
you have to know

30:52.154 --> 30:53.547
I just felt like you know what?

30:53.590 --> 30:55.941
I know Cameron's friends
with Angie, too,

30:55.984 --> 30:59.945
so I asked Angie
for Cameron's phone number.

30:59.988 --> 31:02.599
And I just wanted to know more
about what he said to Meredith.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.906
Like, what--what <i>should</i> we be
alarmed with?

31:04.950 --> 31:06.212
Yeah.

31:06.255 --> 31:07.866
You know,
Whitney doesn't know Cameron.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.128
She has no relationship
with Cameron.

31:09.171 --> 31:12.392
I find it really bizarre
that all of a sudden

31:12.435 --> 31:14.481
Whitney's reaching out
to Cameron.

31:14.524 --> 31:15.830
Do I believe my friend Cameron?
Yeah.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.353
Is there a reason
for these other girls

31:17.397 --> 31:20.574
to be reaching out to him?
Absolutely not.

31:20.617 --> 31:23.359
I went to Cameron just to hear
more about his experience,

31:23.403 --> 31:26.623
because I felt like
I was starting to finally

31:26.667 --> 31:30.584
have the experience that
everyone talks about with Mary,

31:30.627 --> 31:33.630
and after talking to him,
I was just thinking,

31:33.674 --> 31:36.329
if Lisa knows what Cameron
shared with me,

31:36.372 --> 31:40.986
then I get why Lisa doesn't want
to, like, upset Mary either.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.379
Mary's complicated, and we're
navigating someone complicated.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.816
Yeah, but the thing
that scares me is

31:45.860 --> 31:48.950
rumors are that
Mary and Robert are predators.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.256
What?

31:50.299 --> 31:52.432
Yeah. It's online.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.527
Yeah, I-I don't even know
if I'm comfortable saying it

32:00.570 --> 32:04.618
because if it is true,

32:04.661 --> 32:09.362
I don't wanna put my--
my family's safety at risk.

32:09.405 --> 32:12.713
I mean, this is really creepy.
This whole thing is creepy.

32:12.756 --> 32:15.237
Mary and Robert used
that bogeyman mentality--

32:15.281 --> 32:20.025
the fear of God as their power
to get what they want.

32:20.068 --> 32:23.419
That's interesting to me because
when I was in Mary's room

32:23.463 --> 32:25.204
she said something to the effect
with Jen,

32:25.247 --> 32:26.988
where she's like,
"See what happens

32:27.032 --> 32:29.730
when you mess with my church?
You go to jail."

32:29.773 --> 32:31.993
To say all these lies
about me and my church,

32:32.037 --> 32:33.952
look at her now.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.997
Jen. That's what Jen did,
and look where Jen's at.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.564
Okay.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.609
Yeah, she--she messed
with the wrong one.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.700
I'm just like, wow, like, that's
like a big statement, you know?

32:43.744 --> 32:45.050
Like...

32:45.093 --> 32:46.486
I don't know what
she meant by it. I didn't know--

32:46.529 --> 32:48.140
Did she have something
to do with that?

32:48.183 --> 32:49.968
I don't know.
That's what she said, though.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.448
- I was just thinking, too--
- So then you're telling me

32:52.492 --> 32:55.234
right now
that I should be concerned.

32:55.277 --> 32:58.019
It's, like, really dark.

32:58.063 --> 33:02.328
It's sounding like the rumors
about Mary being a cult leader

33:02.371 --> 33:05.331
are probably true.

33:09.248 --> 33:10.684
<i>Coming up...</i>

33:10.727 --> 33:11.859
I didn't know that there was

33:11.902 --> 33:13.078
any charges against me
or anything.

33:13.121 --> 33:14.818
Jen, this is a true story?

33:14.862 --> 33:16.037
This is a true story
on my father--

33:16.081 --> 33:18.300
Like, you have no clue
what's going on?

33:29.311 --> 33:32.184
How far away are you, honey?

33:32.227 --> 33:34.142
I can't reach my shoes.

33:34.186 --> 33:36.144
They're on, like,
the upper shelf of my closet,

33:36.188 --> 33:39.321
so I need you or Brooks
to help me.

33:42.759 --> 33:45.023
Are you listening to me, honey?

33:45.066 --> 33:46.502
Can you see?

33:46.546 --> 33:48.330
I got it.

34:01.691 --> 34:02.692
Which shoe?

34:06.087 --> 34:08.524
I-I prefer the Louboutin.

34:08.568 --> 34:10.613
The Louboutin?

34:10.657 --> 34:12.876
Just on brand name alone.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.269
And it looks like it matches?

34:14.313 --> 34:16.750
- It matches for sure.
- Okay.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.621
I'll do the Louboutin.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.719
Bishop.

34:29.763 --> 34:31.634
Can you bring my coat?

34:33.375 --> 34:34.420
Never mind.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.380
Well, you have to ask first.

34:38.424 --> 34:43.255
It was my Balmain coat
with the grommets.

34:43.298 --> 34:46.954
I'm going to that--
this luncheon, 'kay?

34:46.997 --> 34:49.522
God help me.

35:20.901 --> 35:21.989
- Hi, Meagan.
- Hi, Jennie.

35:22.032 --> 35:23.382
- How are you?
- I'm so great.

35:23.425 --> 35:25.427
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.429
Can I hand this to you
real quickly?

35:27.473 --> 35:29.344
- Sure thing. Let me--
- Oh, that's gorgeous.

35:29.388 --> 35:30.780
Thank you.

35:30.824 --> 35:34.175
My pho luncheon at
the International Peace Gardens

35:34.219 --> 35:36.134
is gonna be very exciting
for me.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.439
- Hand me that box.
- Yeah.

35:37.483 --> 35:39.137
I need to set the napkins down.

35:39.180 --> 35:43.271
I want the ladies to understand
who I am

35:43.315 --> 35:45.055
by getting to know my culture.

35:45.099 --> 35:46.622
So we're gonna put Lisa
over there.

35:46.666 --> 35:47.971
Sure.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.625
In the Vietnamese culture,

35:49.669 --> 35:52.802
When we have conflict,
we sit down

35:52.846 --> 35:56.328
in a nonthreatened environment
and kind of talk it out

35:56.371 --> 35:58.025
and listen to each other.

35:58.068 --> 36:01.898
This is Mary.
Whitney is right there.

36:01.942 --> 36:05.685
Let's find peace.
Internal peace.

36:05.728 --> 36:08.470
- Let's have Jen right there.
- All right.

36:11.647 --> 36:14.824
Cheers to International Gardens
Peace Day bruncheon.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.478
Emphasis on peace.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.219
We're going into this positive.

36:18.263 --> 36:22.005
Oh, yeah. I've--I have nothing
but good vibes right now.

36:22.049 --> 36:26.184
Even though I had a lot
of strong opinions in Vail,

36:26.227 --> 36:27.533
and I had a lot to say
about Jen,

36:27.576 --> 36:30.275
after seeing her
the other night,

36:30.318 --> 36:31.972
my heart kind of softened,

36:32.015 --> 36:34.192
because I just saw
a woman in pain.

36:36.368 --> 36:39.371
Going through this,
truly, truly...

36:39.414 --> 36:42.243
I know who my real friends are.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.940
Have people really
just dropped you?

36:43.984 --> 36:46.552
I haven't even talked to, like,
some of my own family.

36:46.595 --> 36:49.729
It hurts me because it's like
I didn't do this.

36:49.772 --> 36:52.297
It's so easy to jump
to conclusions and judge,

36:52.340 --> 36:54.908
and--and I'm--I was guilty
of that in the moment,

36:54.951 --> 36:57.258
but at the end of the day, Jen,

36:57.302 --> 36:59.695
if you need us to show up
in any way for your kids,

36:59.739 --> 37:02.045
husband, whatever you need,
we're here.

37:02.089 --> 37:05.179
It sounds like you have
an insane road ahead of you.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.269
I feel like even
in our darkest moments,

37:08.313 --> 37:12.186
we could all use
a little grace sometimes.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.276
I hope the invitation
to the luncheon today

37:15.320 --> 37:18.410
is, like, genuine and sincere.
- Tell me--

37:18.453 --> 37:21.021
I'm tired of being judged
every day, you--you know?

37:21.064 --> 37:22.544
We are not your judge and jury.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.242
You tell me you're innocent,
you're innocent,

37:24.285 --> 37:25.721
and I will celebrate
your acquittal with you.

37:25.765 --> 37:28.898
If it goes the other way,
I will grieve and work with you,

37:28.942 --> 37:30.509
and we'll get through it.

37:30.552 --> 37:32.075
- You know what I mean?
- Okay.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.990
But that is what friendship is,

37:34.034 --> 37:37.211
and we can make anything
in our lives right. We can.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.084
Well, hello!

37:41.128 --> 37:43.304
Hello! How are you?

37:43.348 --> 37:45.263
- How are you? This is--
- You look gorgeous.

37:45.306 --> 37:47.613
Oh, thank you. You look amazing.

37:47.656 --> 37:49.441
Thank you.

37:49.484 --> 37:51.051
Hi.

37:51.094 --> 37:52.182
Oh, gorgeous.

37:52.226 --> 37:54.576
- Hello, girlie.
- Thank you.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.274
- Oh, you look fabulous.
- Hello!

37:56.317 --> 37:57.536
- Hi!
- Hi, girls.

37:57.579 --> 38:00.713
- Oh! Beautiful. Mwah.
- Mwah.

38:00.756 --> 38:02.062
- So gorgeous.
- Oh, beautiful!

38:02.105 --> 38:04.107
- Hi.
- Mwah. You look beautiful.

38:04.151 --> 38:06.153
You do, too.

38:06.196 --> 38:08.677
pretty.
I did like you did, too.

38:08.721 --> 38:11.245
Platforms and pants!

38:11.289 --> 38:13.073
She blend in
with the Vietnamese tradition.

38:13.116 --> 38:15.031
I did the straight hair. I wore
the pants under the dress!

38:15.075 --> 38:17.338
The pants with the dress!

38:17.382 --> 38:19.297
- I love it.
- Platforms.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.167
- See?
- I love it.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.866
- So how's everything going?
- Good.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.346
Did you wear your lingerie?

38:25.390 --> 38:27.609
No, I did not wear
the lingerie.

38:27.653 --> 38:29.742
No, I did not go home
with a sexy outfit

38:29.785 --> 38:32.048
because Duy asked
for a sister wife.

38:32.092 --> 38:35.269
I'm not gonna reward him
by dressing up sexy for him.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.705
Hell, no.

38:37.663 --> 38:40.143
Jennie, how are things with Duy?

38:40.187 --> 38:43.451
About...the whole
another wife thing?

38:43.495 --> 38:46.367
- Mm-hmm.
- No, we didn't really talk much,

38:46.411 --> 38:49.370
<i>but</i> he knows how I feel,
and I was like,

38:49.414 --> 38:51.329
we just need to go
to counseling.

38:51.372 --> 38:52.286
You had, like,
the best therapist.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.461
See, I feel like--

38:53.505 --> 38:54.810
I took all your advice
last year.

38:54.854 --> 38:57.378
- My therapist is amaze.
- Yeah, I feel like I--

38:57.422 --> 38:59.119
- Amaze.
- She had great advice.

38:59.162 --> 39:02.514
Like, Meredith would drop little
nuggets that were, like, gold.

39:02.557 --> 39:04.167
She was sharing stuff
about communication,

39:04.211 --> 39:06.561
and I think it's little things
that you forget that, like,

39:06.605 --> 39:09.390
are probably innate and natural.
- Is that Jen?

39:09.434 --> 39:13.742
I believe so. Yes.

39:15.004 --> 39:17.398
Here we go. Lord, have mercy.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.661
Didn't we all have
this conversation

39:19.705 --> 39:22.882
not to invite me
if you invited her?

39:32.195 --> 39:34.459
Walking and praying.
Walking and praying.

39:34.502 --> 39:37.810
I think it's like little things
that you forget that, like,

39:37.853 --> 39:39.507
are probably innate and natural.
- Is that Jen?

39:39.551 --> 39:43.772
I believe so. Yes.

39:45.165 --> 39:47.863
Here we go. Lord, have mercy.

39:49.865 --> 39:52.868
Didn't we all have
this conversation

39:52.912 --> 39:55.001
not to invite me
if you invited her?

39:55.044 --> 39:57.917
I do not want her
in my presence. Is that clear?

39:57.960 --> 39:59.484
- Yes, very.
- Yeah.

39:59.527 --> 40:04.227
So if you want to invite Jen,
do not invite me.

40:06.839 --> 40:08.884
I feel like I'm doing it
at the Peace Garden.

40:08.928 --> 40:11.496
I want it to be peaceful.
I don't want any drama,

40:11.539 --> 40:15.021
and if we have any drama,
we should just set--

40:15.064 --> 40:18.154
So you invited the one person
who starts all the drama.

40:20.156 --> 40:23.203
I'm an adult. I'm not going
to leave because Jen is here.

40:23.246 --> 40:26.336
I'm a little more mature
than that.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.514
I'm just gonna glide
through the lunch

40:29.557 --> 40:32.386
and...not engage.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.561
Hi, guys!

40:33.605 --> 40:35.345
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.477
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi.

40:36.521 --> 40:37.826
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

40:37.870 --> 40:40.438
- How's it going?

40:40.481 --> 40:42.962
- You look pretty.
- Hi, Jen. How are you?

40:43.005 --> 40:46.008
- How are you?
- Good.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.186
I invited you guys here to
the international Peace Garden

40:50.230 --> 40:51.927
'cause I want everything
to be peaceful.

40:51.971 --> 40:53.015
- Is Mary coming?
- Yeah, is Mary coming?

40:53.059 --> 40:54.713
She is. I invited everybody,

40:54.756 --> 40:59.326
and I want all of us to be here
to celebrate my culture.

41:00.675 --> 41:05.637
And I feel like I wanna have
peace in my life.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.769
I want you guys to all have
peace in your life,

41:07.813 --> 41:09.902
and I wish that
upon every one of you.

41:09.945 --> 41:11.338
Well, that's beautiful.
Let's toast.

41:14.341 --> 41:16.038
Yes.

41:17.213 --> 41:19.172
I'm in this
beautiful spiritual garden,

41:19.215 --> 41:23.568
and all I feel is a thick
brick wall of pure tension.

41:23.611 --> 41:28.137
The tension is palpable
just between Meredith and Jen,

41:28.181 --> 41:31.227
and Mary's not even here yet.

41:31.271 --> 41:32.838
All right, when are
we gonna get to the pho?

41:32.881 --> 41:35.275
- We're waiting for Mary.
- Should we go

41:35.318 --> 41:36.624
or we should leave?
- We need more drinks.

41:36.668 --> 41:38.539
Yeah, we should go
and have her meet us there.

41:38.583 --> 41:39.888
Lead the way, Jennie.

41:42.064 --> 41:45.285
This way.
We're gonna cross two bridges.

41:45.328 --> 41:47.548
- Hold on to the thing.
- This is cute.

41:47.592 --> 41:49.463
You're gonna fall if you don't.

41:53.162 --> 41:55.469
- Welcome.
It's so pretty.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.166
- There's names on the napkins.
- Where are you sitting?

41:57.210 --> 41:59.734
There's names right here.
This is Meredith.

41:59.778 --> 42:01.954
- Okay.
- Jen, you sit over there.

42:01.997 --> 42:04.260
- Oh, okay.
- So...

42:04.304 --> 42:07.220
are we gonna wait for Mary
a little bit?

42:07.263 --> 42:08.830
- Maybe call her and see.
- Is Mary going right here?

42:08.874 --> 42:10.658
Yes.

42:10.702 --> 42:13.313
Jennie, were you not in Vail?

42:13.356 --> 42:15.228
None of us are saying what we
think or feel right now

42:15.271 --> 42:17.535
'cause we're scared of Mary.

42:17.578 --> 42:20.363
I was in Vail.

42:23.323 --> 42:26.152
I organized it. You guys are
sitting where you're gonna sit.

42:26.195 --> 42:28.676
I got
my rose-colored glasses.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.591
Can we just...

42:30.635 --> 42:32.158
I'm golden.

42:32.201 --> 42:34.160
I just wanna say thank you
for being here,

42:34.203 --> 42:37.032
and with our culture, how we
share love to one another

42:37.076 --> 42:39.165
is by sharing food
with each other.

42:41.341 --> 42:42.864
Because I love all y'all...

42:42.908 --> 42:44.344
-...I wanna share

42:44.387 --> 42:47.390
our traditional Vietnamese
dishes with you today.

42:47.434 --> 42:50.785
We have these drinks.
It's a little spicy.

42:50.829 --> 42:54.702
This is just fresh mango
with lime and bird's eye chili.

42:54.746 --> 42:56.182
What's a bird's eye chili?

42:56.225 --> 42:58.837
Don't eat it.

42:58.880 --> 42:59.925
It's a garnish.

42:59.968 --> 43:02.144
Mmm.

43:02.188 --> 43:03.363
Mm, that's amazing.

43:13.242 --> 43:16.202
- Oh, that looks gorgeous.

43:16.245 --> 43:18.552
- Thank you.
- Bon appÃ©tit.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.293
So you have spring rolls
and then you have summer roll.

43:20.336 --> 43:22.121
- Okay.
- It looks great.

43:22.164 --> 43:23.557
So you eat it with your fingers,
Lisa.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.559
- Oh, really?
- This is finger food.

43:25.603 --> 43:28.388
The shrimp one--
use it with sesame.

43:28.431 --> 43:30.303
- The darker sauce?
- Yeah, this sauce right here.

43:30.346 --> 43:32.348
- Got it.
- Mmm, so good.

43:32.392 --> 43:34.089
Okay,
I'm dipping right now.

43:34.133 --> 43:35.700
- It feels so healthy.
- So good.

43:35.743 --> 43:37.353
So good.

43:37.397 --> 43:40.443
We don't do a lot of fried
in Vietnam or deep-fried stuff,

43:40.487 --> 43:42.489
so we'll do a lot of steamed--
- Mary's here.

43:42.532 --> 43:44.099
I made it.

43:44.143 --> 43:45.492
- Hi, Mary!
- Hi, Jen. How are you?

43:45.535 --> 43:47.842
- Be careful.
- She made it.

43:47.886 --> 43:50.889
Jen, I have to give you a hug.
How are you, Miss Thang?

43:50.932 --> 43:55.328
- I'm doing good. Thank you.
- Good. Nice to see you.

43:55.371 --> 43:57.069
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

43:57.112 --> 43:58.070
- Mwah.
- Hi, Whitney.

43:58.113 --> 43:59.941
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi, Heather.

43:59.985 --> 44:01.726
Hi, Mary.
You're right next to me.

44:01.769 --> 44:04.511
I am. I apologize to everyone.

44:04.554 --> 44:06.818
As long as I can be right
on time with the food, right?

44:06.861 --> 44:08.820
- Yeah.
- You made it.

44:08.863 --> 44:10.560
I came for the food!

44:10.604 --> 44:12.780
Oh, Mary, you're blonde.
I love it.

44:12.824 --> 44:14.303
- It's beautiful.
- We'll talk after.

44:14.347 --> 44:16.392
It's called a different wig.

44:18.351 --> 44:19.569
I actually think it looks good.
I think--You know what?

44:19.613 --> 44:21.702
You look amazing as a blonde.
So does she.

44:21.746 --> 44:23.312
Okay, that was odd.

44:23.356 --> 44:24.923
- Yeah, she's--
- You've been a blonde?

44:24.966 --> 44:26.272
I wore a wig.

44:26.315 --> 44:27.447
We had her in a blonde wig
the other day.

44:27.490 --> 44:28.535
- Oh, you did?
- That's why she said it.

44:28.578 --> 44:30.102
- She's like, "Huh?"
- I thought you--

44:30.145 --> 44:31.799
You do have yellow tones,
though.

44:31.843 --> 44:33.801
Mary, you gotta see this.

44:35.542 --> 44:37.762
- Ooh. Nice.
- I like it.

44:39.677 --> 44:41.287
You look like
an anime character.

44:41.330 --> 44:42.723
- She does.
- You look gorgeous.

44:42.767 --> 44:44.464
Yeah, you look surreal.

44:44.507 --> 44:47.597
I like the slanted eyes.
Ah! Love it.

44:47.641 --> 44:49.991
What the hell?

44:50.035 --> 44:53.647
Did Mary just say
she likes my slanted eyes?

44:54.822 --> 44:56.737
Does she not know
it's inappropriate?

44:56.781 --> 44:58.913
That is not even a compliment.

44:58.957 --> 45:01.960
If this wasn't my event,

45:02.003 --> 45:04.745
Mary would've been
on the ground.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.792
Thank you.

45:07.835 --> 45:10.490
So this is BÃ¡nh MiÃ¬.
It's called BÃ¡nh MiÃ¬.

45:10.533 --> 45:12.622
- Wait, what is BÃ¡nh MiÃ¬?
- It's a Vietnamese hoagie.

45:12.666 --> 45:15.974
Even though we, uh, like,
had left on a bad note,

45:16.017 --> 45:19.499
I'm pleasantly surprised that
you were able to resume me back.

45:19.542 --> 45:21.501
I just--I didn't know
what we're--

45:21.544 --> 45:23.459
I didn't know what
the temperature was gonna be.

45:23.503 --> 45:26.071
Well, you know my temperature.

45:26.114 --> 45:28.029
Yeah, you're usually
pretty good.

45:28.073 --> 45:30.815
Like, you know, I hoped that
you'd forgotten everything.

45:30.858 --> 45:32.294
- You know?
- Me, too.

45:32.338 --> 45:34.253
- I just wanna be at peace, man.
- And I just wanna...

45:34.296 --> 45:35.994
There's so much crap, you know?

45:39.127 --> 45:42.870
I like you. I like <i>Heather.</i>

45:42.914 --> 45:44.089
Thank you.

45:44.132 --> 45:48.528
Well, let's--do you wanna
toast to that?

45:48.571 --> 45:50.791
Yeah, you have, like, a drink.
Well, I have to--

45:50.835 --> 45:53.620
Well, listen, I saved it
for this very first purpose.

45:55.187 --> 45:56.754
Mary doesn't hold on
to any grudges.

45:56.797 --> 45:59.713
Like, she will pull her--her
stiletto blade from her boot,

45:59.757 --> 46:02.542
slice your vital organ,
put it back,

46:02.585 --> 46:04.544
and then be like,
"What's for dinner?"

46:06.067 --> 46:07.677
She's a silent killer.

46:07.721 --> 46:10.855
Everybody's friends.
The Peace Gardens works.

46:10.898 --> 46:12.465
Yay! The Peace Garden works.

46:12.508 --> 46:16.338
There's peace. Everybody's
besties. I love it.

46:16.382 --> 46:20.516
So this is filet mignon pho.
The meat is very tender.

46:20.560 --> 46:23.389
Filet mignon pho.
I've never in my life.

46:23.432 --> 46:24.825
Yeah.
I've had, like, mutton pho.

46:24.869 --> 46:26.392
This is gonna be awesome.

46:26.435 --> 46:27.872
You put these in here,
just the leaves.

46:27.915 --> 46:30.526
Don't eat the stem.
It's very hard to digest.

46:30.570 --> 46:32.572
I have had pho,
but never like this.

46:32.615 --> 46:34.400
Okay.
I will put the whole thing.

46:34.443 --> 46:36.445
Hey, are we even in reality,

46:36.489 --> 46:37.882
or am I tripping on shrooms
right now?

46:37.925 --> 46:42.060
Like, is this even real?

46:42.103 --> 46:44.105
Yeah, they are.

46:51.286 --> 46:54.681
Yeah, it's just--it's funny to
me that we're all just, like...

46:54.724 --> 46:56.117
Ahh.

46:56.161 --> 46:58.641
Well, you're sure we all
are doing that, or are you?

47:07.302 --> 47:10.262
Hey, are we even reality, or am
I tripping on shrooms right now?

47:10.305 --> 47:14.353
Like, is this even real?

47:14.396 --> 47:15.963
Yeah.

47:18.444 --> 47:19.967
- I heard that, too.
- Yeah.

47:20.011 --> 47:22.448
It's just--It's funny to me
that we're all just, like...

47:22.491 --> 47:23.536
- Ahh.
- Are you sure we all

47:23.579 --> 47:26.104
are doing that, or are--
Are you?

47:26.147 --> 47:28.106
No, I just think it's
interesting that last time

47:28.149 --> 47:30.238
we were all together,
it was very uncomfortable.

47:30.282 --> 47:35.069
It was very heated,
and clearly we were not okay.

47:35.113 --> 47:36.679
Heather and I were left
on our own,

47:36.723 --> 47:38.203
and I think
it's really fascinating

47:38.246 --> 47:41.293
that we're all sitting here
like it never happened.

47:43.991 --> 47:47.038
I know it's awkward that
we pretend nothing happened,

47:47.081 --> 47:48.169
but I know
that a lot happened.

47:48.213 --> 47:50.389
Like, we missed Jen
at the Vail trip,

47:50.432 --> 47:52.782
and there's a lot going on.

47:52.826 --> 47:55.568
There's a lot that was said,
so you know,

47:55.611 --> 47:59.137
I just wanted us to talk to Jen.
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

47:59.180 --> 48:00.921
Our purpose is not
to hurt people.

48:00.965 --> 48:05.143
No, let's talk about it.
I mean...yeah.

48:05.186 --> 48:10.235
Yeah. You know, I had no idea
anything like this would happen.

48:10.278 --> 48:14.456
Like, I've never been in trouble
in my entire life.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.284
I've had a speeding ticket,
and that's it.

48:16.328 --> 48:18.156
I didn't go to jail.
I didn't get booked in jail,

48:18.199 --> 48:21.333
despite whatever
was on the media.

48:21.376 --> 48:22.551
Sweetheart, I can tell you
by the outfit

48:22.595 --> 48:24.945
you didn't go to jail.

48:24.989 --> 48:26.773
I loved your outfit, by the way.

48:26.816 --> 48:27.948
- Thank you.

48:27.992 --> 48:29.907
- And it did not...
- The fur was good.

48:29.950 --> 48:32.170
- The braids were amazing.
- Yeah, yeah.

48:32.213 --> 48:33.823
Well, I thought I was going
to Vail, not jail.

48:33.867 --> 48:35.042
You know?
- Vail, not jail.

48:35.086 --> 48:37.218
- Yeah.
- They took me to a building.

48:37.262 --> 48:38.959
They talked to me
and asked me questions

48:39.003 --> 48:40.526
about these people and I don't--
I don't know--

48:40.569 --> 48:43.703
I don't know who the names are
that he's asking me.

48:43.746 --> 48:44.965
And I didn't know that there was

48:45.009 --> 48:46.314
any charges against me
or anything.

48:46.358 --> 48:47.794
So, of course,
I'm telling them everything,

48:47.837 --> 48:50.144
like, "What do you wanna know?
This must be a mistake."

48:50.188 --> 48:52.973
So you're completely oblivious
to every--

48:53.017 --> 48:54.279
- Completely oblivious.
- Like there's noth--

48:54.322 --> 48:58.674
- Like, really?
- Absolutely, 110%.

48:58.718 --> 49:00.241
Jen, this is a true story?

49:00.285 --> 49:03.505
This is--This is feeling like
a whole--from what we got,

49:03.549 --> 49:06.856
like... I mean, I'm just--I mean,
I'm just--I'm just asking.

49:06.900 --> 49:08.162
This is a true story
on my father.

49:08.206 --> 49:10.730
Like, you have no clue
what's going on?

49:14.168 --> 49:15.865
No! I had no clue
what's going on.

49:15.909 --> 49:17.171
- Oh.
- Do you think I'm gonna show up

49:17.215 --> 49:18.303
at Beauty Lab if I know
that they're coming?

49:18.346 --> 49:20.914
I get that, but I mean,
after the fact.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.177
No, I have no idea
what's going on.

49:23.221 --> 49:26.224
So they randomly just chose
your name to think that

49:26.267 --> 49:29.314
you and Stuart...

49:29.357 --> 49:31.707
I have no idea, but I don't know
any of the people

49:31.751 --> 49:33.883
that they asked me about.

49:33.927 --> 49:35.929
You have no clue?

49:35.973 --> 49:39.454
I have no clue
what they're talking about.

49:48.246 --> 49:50.900
Okay. My question is, you know,
we read everything,

49:50.944 --> 49:53.251
and they texted us
a lot of information.

49:53.294 --> 49:54.730
I just want you to understand--

49:54.774 --> 49:55.862
Who texted you
a lot of information?

49:55.905 --> 49:57.342
- Whitney.
- Whitney sent text messages.

49:57.385 --> 49:59.257
Texts about, you know,
your arrests and all that stuff.

49:59.300 --> 50:02.390
- Um, I was not the only person.
- Yeah, but they text you--

50:02.434 --> 50:04.827
- Our phones were all blowing up.
- I didn't get texted.

50:04.871 --> 50:06.525
I got called by my--
My lawyer called me.

50:06.568 --> 50:08.005
You called your lawyer. But we
were all getting phone calls.

50:08.048 --> 50:09.310
I called my lawyer,
but then my other lawyer

50:09.354 --> 50:10.311
that I did not call
called me back.

50:10.355 --> 50:11.660
I was begging her
to call me back.

50:11.704 --> 50:15.360
I could not read enough.
I was Googling. I was--

50:15.403 --> 50:16.665
Lisa, Lisa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:16.709 --> 50:17.797
The bottom line is
you guys had news

50:17.840 --> 50:20.017
that she was arrested, okay?

50:20.060 --> 50:23.020
Excuse me, Jennie, Jennie.
I did not talk about you.

50:26.284 --> 50:28.503
She said horrible things
about Jen in Vail.

50:28.547 --> 50:30.462
I feel like she's reaping.

50:30.505 --> 50:32.942
What I'm believing in--
what a man soweth,

50:32.986 --> 50:34.770
<i>that</i> he shall also reap.

50:34.814 --> 50:36.990
She's scammed old people

50:37.034 --> 50:38.165
and people
that don't have money,

50:38.209 --> 50:40.907
that can't afford,
if that's the case,

50:40.950 --> 50:42.604
with no remorse.

50:42.648 --> 50:45.738
I never saw nothing good in her.
Never, and I was scared of her

50:45.781 --> 50:48.132
because I knew
what she was capable of.

50:48.175 --> 50:51.048
And now she's gonna look Jen
across from her soup

50:51.091 --> 50:54.964
and say, "I didn't say
anything bad about you, Jen."

50:55.008 --> 50:56.836
- I-I didn't.
- Thank you, Mary.

50:56.879 --> 50:58.229
Jen, everybody was talking
about it.

50:58.272 --> 50:59.665
- Everybody was talking.
- It was big moves.

50:59.708 --> 51:00.883
- I was not.
- It was big moves.

51:00.927 --> 51:01.928
- No, no, no, no.
- No, that's--

51:01.971 --> 51:03.060
It was a big thing
of our dinner.

51:03.103 --> 51:04.626
It was everybody was talking
about it.

51:04.670 --> 51:07.151
-...what a big thing. Yes.
- Everybody was talking about it.

51:07.194 --> 51:09.109
Jen, if I were--
if that happened to me,

51:09.153 --> 51:10.719
we'd all be talking about it.
- When I said everyone,

51:10.763 --> 51:12.460
I meant everyone, including
myself, were talking about it.

51:12.504 --> 51:14.027
Well, what do you wanna--
I don't know why

51:14.071 --> 51:15.768
you have to tell her this--
to hurt her?

51:15.811 --> 51:17.291
I would rather tell you to your
face. I ain't gonna lie to you.

51:17.335 --> 51:18.814
No, it's not to hurt her.
It's honesty. It's being honest.

51:18.858 --> 51:19.815
-'Cause I didn't talk about it.
- That's what friends do,

51:19.859 --> 51:20.947
is they're honest about it.

51:20.990 --> 51:22.253
I don't know
if I needed to be here

51:22.296 --> 51:24.603
for the first seven courses
of the pho lunch.

51:24.646 --> 51:26.039
- They have information.
- It was a lot for all of us.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.127
- She texted it to me.
- And I said--

51:27.171 --> 51:28.389
You guys are fighting over

51:28.433 --> 51:31.131
who said the most worst thing
about me.

51:31.175 --> 51:33.829
I'm gonna be upfront
and tell you to your face.

51:33.873 --> 51:35.309
I already feel like
a piece of sh--.

51:35.353 --> 51:37.224
You don't need to do this
with me here.

51:37.268 --> 51:40.575
Y'all could've invited me
for just the dessert course.

51:40.619 --> 51:42.490
I didn't feel comfortable
talking about it.

51:42.534 --> 51:44.231
- Did I talk about it?
- I'm just gonna say

51:44.275 --> 51:45.450
one thing right now, you guys.
- It's honest. It's honest.

51:45.493 --> 51:47.495
- I did not.
- I'm gonna say one thing.

51:47.539 --> 51:51.543
I had no idea
what the was going on.

51:51.586 --> 51:53.327
- I'm coming from a real place.
- At this point--

51:53.371 --> 51:56.113
Are you upset
what they're saying?

51:56.156 --> 51:58.376
- Is that why you're saying this?
- No, I'm upset because

51:58.419 --> 52:03.990
my freedom is at question. I am
fighting for something bigger.

52:04.033 --> 52:06.035
Do I hope she's innocent? Yeah.

52:06.079 --> 52:09.126
But do I think Jen is innocent?

52:09.169 --> 52:12.041
No. We're talking about the FBI,
Homeland Security,

52:12.085 --> 52:15.175
and New York--No.

52:15.219 --> 52:18.309
- You're not guilty, so then--
- I'm not guilty but now--

52:18.352 --> 52:20.224
That's what due process is for.
That's why we have due process.

52:20.267 --> 52:22.400
Oh, my God.
Can I please talk to Jen?

52:22.443 --> 52:25.881
But now I have to go through
the whole process,

52:25.925 --> 52:28.057
put a $2 million retainer,

52:28.101 --> 52:29.885
have a team of attorneys.

52:29.929 --> 52:31.365
- That's what I have to do.
- But if you're not guilty,

52:31.409 --> 52:34.542
you're completely scared
that they might frame you, or...

52:34.586 --> 52:36.327
I'm framed because how
the did they even come?

52:36.370 --> 52:37.589
I see. I'm trying to see--

52:37.632 --> 52:38.981
Because it's
the federal government.

52:39.025 --> 52:40.679
It's her fighting
the federal government.

52:40.722 --> 52:44.117
- I'm talking to Jen, <i>Lisa.
- Okay, but I'm just saying...</i>

52:44.161 --> 52:45.553
Stop. Don't do that.
I don't like that.

52:45.597 --> 52:46.902
...for her, it's the
federal government versus Jen.

52:46.946 --> 52:47.860
- That's a big deal.
- I'm talking to <i>her.</i>

52:47.903 --> 52:49.078
Let me talk.

52:51.429 --> 52:52.734
You are talking. We're all
talking. It's a conversation.

52:52.778 --> 52:54.214
I know, but come and talk
and say what you say.

52:54.258 --> 52:55.824
- We're a friend group.
- You have a lot to say.

52:55.868 --> 52:57.696
It's a friend group. It's a
friend group. We're all talking.

52:57.739 --> 52:59.393
Okay, but I'm really coming
from a real place,

52:59.437 --> 53:01.613
and I don't wanna
hear your side.

53:01.656 --> 53:03.223
- I wanna hear from the source.
- I'm not.

53:03.267 --> 53:04.137
I'm not giving my side, 'cause I
don't have a side in this.

53:04.181 --> 53:05.312
Yeah, but you keep chiming in.

53:05.356 --> 53:09.447
Lisa's not self-aware
of her behavior.

53:09.490 --> 53:11.753
She's like
a little Tasmanian Devil.

53:11.797 --> 53:13.581
I'm done with this.

53:13.625 --> 53:15.279
She'll start something.
Like, she'll say something

53:15.322 --> 53:18.586
because...maybe 'cause she eats
candy and doesn't eat food,

53:18.630 --> 53:21.415
and maybe her periods are bad.
I don't know.

53:21.459 --> 53:22.721
- I wanna talk to her.
- Mary, Mary, Mary,

53:22.764 --> 53:24.244
let's just be good,
'cause I like literally--

53:24.288 --> 53:25.637
I really wanted--I really wanted
to talk to you.

53:25.680 --> 53:27.769
- Okay.
- I wanted to see how you was.

53:27.813 --> 53:29.162
Did you call her? Did you
call her? Have you called Jen?

53:29.206 --> 53:30.903
No, I don't have her number.
You just stop.

53:30.946 --> 53:32.426
- No, then I mean--
- Don't do that.

53:32.470 --> 53:33.732
Don't even do that.
Don't you dare do that.

53:33.775 --> 53:35.037
What you're doing to me
is wrong right now.

53:35.081 --> 53:36.604
'Cause you talk about things
that are--

53:36.648 --> 53:38.171
- You guys, just stop.
- I didn't. I did not, actually.

53:38.215 --> 53:40.434
- I did not, Mary. I did not.
- Yes, you did. Yes, she did.

53:40.478 --> 53:42.436
- No, I said--I'm--I have no--
- Yes, she did,

53:42.480 --> 53:44.699
and she talked about me. She
said that I was the next you.

53:44.743 --> 53:45.918
- Oh, is that--
- Yeah, let's get real.

53:45.961 --> 53:46.962
I did not say that, Mary Cosby.

53:47.006 --> 53:48.790
- Did she say that?
- That's a lie.

53:57.321 --> 54:00.889
She talked about me,
said that I was the next you.

54:00.933 --> 54:03.631
- Yeah, let's get real.
- I did not say that, Mary Cosby.

54:03.675 --> 54:04.937
- That's a lie.
- Did she say that?

54:04.980 --> 54:06.373
I did not say that.
I have never said that.

54:06.417 --> 54:08.506
You guys don't have a backbone?

54:10.638 --> 54:12.379
You guys, like, this is, like,
----ing bullsh--.

54:12.423 --> 54:13.772
You guys are all ----ing fake.

54:13.815 --> 54:17.297
- Don't talk to me about that.
- Not you. Not you.

54:17.341 --> 54:20.387
- I'm silent sitting here, so...
- She's saying what she did.

54:20.431 --> 54:23.651
You're wrong.

54:23.695 --> 54:26.088
- No, it's ridiculous.
- Can Mary please resume

54:26.132 --> 54:27.612
her conversation with Jen?
- Sorry, Jen.

54:27.655 --> 54:29.440
Holy [bleep], Lisa.

54:29.483 --> 54:32.007
- Don't make this about me.
- You're making it about you.

54:32.051 --> 54:33.835
You keep chiming in.
That's all I'm saying.

54:33.879 --> 54:35.010
- Stop chiming in.
- Oh.

54:35.054 --> 54:38.187
I'm trying to talk to Jen.
I care.

54:38.231 --> 54:39.580
I don't judge.

54:39.624 --> 54:43.758
I-I felt betrayal if that's what
the situation was,

54:43.802 --> 54:46.544
because you--who can't believe
the FBI?

54:46.587 --> 54:48.154
They're not coming
for no reason.

54:48.197 --> 54:50.504
- This is ----ing nuts.
- Okay, this is bullsh--.

54:50.548 --> 54:52.027
This is so full of sh--.

54:52.071 --> 54:53.638
- No, Mary, unh-unh.
- You believe that, right?

54:53.681 --> 54:54.943
- I sat next to you!
- What?

54:54.987 --> 54:56.075
- I sat next to you.
- Don't do that.

54:56.118 --> 54:57.511
You said--
No, this is what you said.

54:57.555 --> 54:58.730
- What did I say?
- You said,

54:58.773 --> 55:00.384
"I believe she did it,"
and you said

55:00.427 --> 55:01.994
we shouldn't talk about it.
- Well, I sure did--Jen.

55:02.037 --> 55:03.430
You talked about it
as much as we did.

55:03.474 --> 55:05.650
Don't lie, Mary. Don't lie.
I was right next to you.

55:05.693 --> 55:07.478
- Okay, okay, can I talk?
- No, you can't talk

55:07.521 --> 55:10.307
because you're lying.
- I did--Jen.

55:10.350 --> 55:13.135
If you're gonna talk sh--
about Jen behind her back,

55:13.179 --> 55:14.615
then own up to it.

55:14.659 --> 55:16.356
Since you're a lady of God,
be more honest,

55:16.400 --> 55:20.186
because you preach to
your congregation about honesty.

55:20.229 --> 55:23.189
Mary, be honest about it.
Stop lying.

55:23.232 --> 55:25.539
Saying, you know, "I was
caring about you. I care"--

55:25.583 --> 55:28.368
that's a load of bullsh--,
okay?

55:28.412 --> 55:31.197
No, you can't say that
'cause you don't know me.

55:31.240 --> 55:34.200
Oh, I don't know you, but what
you said was bullsh--, Mary.

55:34.243 --> 55:35.723
I'm calling you out
on your bullsh--.

55:35.767 --> 55:37.246
First of all, first of all,
please don't yell at me.

55:37.290 --> 55:38.987
I'm calling you--I don't like
yelling at you, okay?

55:39.031 --> 55:40.511
Okay, well, don't talk--
Talk to me with respect.

55:40.554 --> 55:41.903
Mary, don't tell me what to do.
I can speak for myself.

55:41.947 --> 55:43.296
I'm not trying to tell you
what to do.

55:43.340 --> 55:44.558
Yes, you are.
Don't tell me how to speak.

55:44.602 --> 55:45.994
Sweetheart, I'm trying
to enlighten you

55:46.038 --> 55:47.387
is what I'm trying to do.
- Mary, I don't give a crap

55:47.431 --> 55:48.736
about what you said.
- Well, you won't look at me,

55:48.780 --> 55:50.738
or who you gonna look at?
- No, here, I'll look at you.

55:50.782 --> 55:52.523
Now say what now?
You don't care about me?

55:52.566 --> 55:53.785
No, I don't.

55:53.828 --> 55:56.091
Okay, then I don't need
to be here.

55:57.441 --> 55:58.703
There's the gate.

55:58.746 --> 56:01.836
Okay. 'Cause you don't know me,
sweetheart.

56:01.880 --> 56:04.056
Mary, don't leave.

56:04.099 --> 56:05.840
What I won't be called
is a liar.

56:05.884 --> 56:07.668
You did talk about Jen.

56:07.712 --> 56:10.062
- You did talk about--
- Jen, no--

56:10.105 --> 56:11.846
- No, Meredith, I want to go.
- You did talk about Jen.

56:13.239 --> 56:15.241
No, I'm not doing this.
I'm getting out of here.

56:15.284 --> 56:16.634
Let's have a little minute.
Let's--Come on.

56:16.677 --> 56:17.852
I'm not taking this from her.

56:17.896 --> 56:20.289
- I've had of this sh--.
- I know, me, too.

56:22.379 --> 56:25.077
If I judged her,
it'd be a whole situation.

56:25.120 --> 56:29.037
Whew. I wanted to backhand her.
Yeah, just...

56:29.081 --> 56:30.343
She knows nothing about me.

56:30.387 --> 56:33.433
A liar's the one thing
that will make me leave.

56:33.477 --> 56:37.045
Don't you dare call me a liar.

56:37.089 --> 56:38.612
'Cause the liars are sitting
at the table.

56:38.656 --> 56:39.961
Did you hear what she just said?

56:40.005 --> 56:41.441
No, it's all bullsh--.
It's all bullsh--.

56:41.485 --> 56:42.311
You know what? We all went
through a myriad emotions.

56:42.355 --> 56:43.704
It was traumatic.

56:43.748 --> 56:46.185
I still probably have PTSD
from that day.

56:46.228 --> 56:47.795
You don't think I do?

56:47.839 --> 56:51.059
I'm not diminishing what
you're feeling. And listen--

56:51.103 --> 56:53.322
I really hope that nobody
goes through this.

56:53.366 --> 56:54.715
No, listen, wait, wait.
Jen, wait.

56:54.759 --> 56:57.979
- I'll be right back.
- Just take a breath.

56:58.023 --> 57:01.156
- I'll be right back.
- Just let her have a breath.

57:01.200 --> 57:04.595
- Jen, you're okay, though.

57:08.512 --> 57:12.690
Come on, baby girl.
You know me. You know me.

57:12.733 --> 57:14.648
Come on. Come on.

57:14.692 --> 57:16.433
I'm-a always keep it real
with you.

57:16.476 --> 57:18.913
Those liars are sitting
at the table, sweetheart.

57:18.957 --> 57:21.133
I don't have to lie to you,
and you know that.

57:21.176 --> 57:23.004
I'm sick of the ----ing, like,
craziness.

57:23.048 --> 57:24.658
I'm seriously sick of it.
I'm--I have a very--Not you.

57:24.702 --> 57:27.356
- You're the only one talking.
- No, but that was you guys--

57:27.400 --> 57:28.662
- You guys know.
- Just take a deep breath.

57:28.706 --> 57:30.011
No, I'm not gonna take
a deep breath.

57:30.055 --> 57:31.056
Yes.

57:31.099 --> 57:32.579
Because I'm being myself
right now.

57:32.623 --> 57:33.972
I'm not taking a deep breath.
I'll take a deep breath

57:34.015 --> 57:35.277
when I ----ing feel like it.

57:35.321 --> 57:36.322
I don't have an issue
with you right now.

57:36.365 --> 57:40.065
Lisa needs to...

57:40.108 --> 57:41.806
Shut up.

57:43.677 --> 57:46.158
Sit over here for a second.

57:46.201 --> 57:48.160
You know what? You guys all say
you wanna be her friend,

57:48.203 --> 57:50.336
and this is what you just
did to her?

57:50.379 --> 57:52.120
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Are you kidding me?

57:52.164 --> 57:53.731
- That's what I said.
- I'm the only one

57:53.774 --> 57:55.515
sitting here calmly,
and I'm the only one

57:55.559 --> 57:59.171
who was like, I'm checked out.
I'm not interested.

57:59.214 --> 58:00.259
Let her be.
If you're her friend,

58:00.302 --> 58:03.349
be her fricking friend
or don't.

58:03.392 --> 58:05.438
- Oh, my gosh.
- Stop making it about ourselves.

58:05.482 --> 58:06.831
Stop playing it!

58:06.874 --> 58:08.876
I-I pray to God you're guilty.

58:10.530 --> 58:12.314
...you're innocent.
Why did I say that?

58:12.358 --> 58:15.230
- I <i>am</i> innocent.
- Okay. Let's, you know,

58:15.274 --> 58:17.406
let's...
whatever...the situation is.

58:17.450 --> 58:19.496
Do I follow it? No.

58:19.539 --> 58:22.847
I'm not gonna sit there and rip
someone behind their back

58:22.890 --> 58:24.849
and play their friend
to their face.

58:24.892 --> 58:26.372
That's not cool.

58:26.415 --> 58:29.506
To me, that's what I would say
is fake.

58:33.945 --> 58:36.513
I love you, Mer,
but I have a problem with this,

58:36.556 --> 58:38.776
because you know what?
I didn't attack Jen at all.

58:38.819 --> 58:40.995
- I'm freezing.
- I don't think that's okay.

58:41.039 --> 58:42.867
Somebody was attacking her
enough where she got up

58:42.910 --> 58:44.390
out of that chair
and started crying.

58:44.433 --> 58:45.826
Are you gonna defend Mary?
Are you gonna ----ing defend

58:45.870 --> 58:47.219
what Mary said? I hope not.
- I didn't defend Mary.

58:47.262 --> 58:48.394
- I hope not. That was not okay.
- Mary--But Mary wasn't

58:48.437 --> 58:49.787
sitting there
when she got up crying.

58:49.830 --> 58:50.875
- That is not okay.
- That I do know.

58:50.918 --> 58:52.398
This is super hurtful.

58:52.441 --> 58:54.052
Like, I've been friends
with Meredith for over 10 years,

58:54.095 --> 58:55.314
and it seems like
there's a pattern here,

58:55.357 --> 58:58.012
like if it has to do
with Mary Cosby

58:58.056 --> 59:02.408
or Meredith and her family,
it's okay to defend them.

59:02.451 --> 59:05.542
But when it comes to me, it's
like, hey, fend for yourself.

59:05.585 --> 59:07.631
I know what she said
at the dinner table.

59:07.674 --> 59:09.067
Thank you.

59:09.110 --> 59:10.721
She was basically
accusing her of being guilty,

59:10.764 --> 59:13.332
and she's acting like, "Oh, no,
now we're good. Kumbaya."

59:13.375 --> 59:14.942
No, I was processing,
and I thought that very--

59:14.986 --> 59:16.553
Everybody speculated
on her innocence or guilt.

59:16.596 --> 59:19.077
No, I said a lot.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.774
You know what I told myself?

59:20.818 --> 59:25.474
I'm willing to be a friend to
you through this time for you.

59:25.518 --> 59:29.304
I've been praying that you--
you--that you come out okay.

59:29.348 --> 59:33.439
Seriously, I'm sick of it.
Don't ----ing play dumb.

59:33.482 --> 59:34.832
You know what?
I can't, honestly.

59:34.875 --> 59:36.573
I love you guys. I gotta go.
I can't do this.

59:36.616 --> 59:38.096
No, you're not--why can't--
why are you doing this?

59:38.139 --> 59:41.795
No, she has ----ing traumatized
my family for two years,

59:41.839 --> 59:43.318
and I'm listening
about traumatic?

59:43.362 --> 59:44.842
- I'm not interested. Goodbye.
- Okay, but see,

59:44.885 --> 59:46.278
that's a whole nother thing,
Meredith.

59:46.321 --> 59:47.627
- No, it's not another thing.
- Yes, it is!

59:47.671 --> 59:49.020
I said don't include me
if you're including her.

59:49.063 --> 59:51.283
- You chose to do it. I'm out.
- But listen. But--

59:51.326 --> 59:52.719
Thank you, Jennie.
It was lovely,

59:52.763 --> 59:54.242
but I told you not to do this
to begin with, so...

59:54.286 --> 59:55.896
This is not fair
because you're--

59:55.940 --> 59:57.681
- I want it to be peaceful.
- This is not fair.

59:57.724 --> 59:58.943
- I understand.
- Meredith...

59:58.986 --> 1:00:00.248
This is not peaceful.
It's not. It's not.

1:00:00.292 --> 1:00:01.859
Meredith, Meredith,
so you know, it's--

1:00:01.902 --> 1:00:04.252
You have been screaming for
a half-hour. I can't anymore.

1:00:04.296 --> 1:00:05.471
Ha ha!

1:00:16.569 --> 1:00:17.657
- Meredith.
- This is not peaceful.

1:00:17.701 --> 1:00:19.224
- Meredith--
- It's not. It's not.

1:00:19.267 --> 1:00:20.791
So, you know--

1:00:20.834 --> 1:00:22.270
You have been screaming for
a half-hour. I can't anymore.

1:00:22.314 --> 1:00:23.489
- Ha ha!
- I can't.

1:00:23.532 --> 1:00:25.056
Oh, so it's all my fault.
Okay, I got it.

1:00:25.099 --> 1:00:27.624
No, It's not you. I'm telling
you because you're yelling

1:00:27.667 --> 1:00:30.627
in my face, and I need you
to be speak to me quieter.

1:00:30.670 --> 1:00:34.456
That's why I said we need
to <i>talk,</i> not screaming.

1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:37.111
Mom and Dad are fighting.
What do we do?

1:00:37.155 --> 1:00:40.985
Ladies, this is
the International Peace Gardens.

1:00:41.028 --> 1:00:44.945
How many storm-offs
and tears need to be shed

1:00:44.989 --> 1:00:46.555
for us to realize that
we are missing the point

1:00:46.599 --> 1:00:48.645
of the entire luncheon?

1:00:48.688 --> 1:00:50.037
I have to talk to you.

1:00:50.081 --> 1:00:52.779
I feel like I'm the only one
that got the memo.

1:00:52.823 --> 1:00:55.956
Is--Can we--Can we stop
for a second?

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.959
You know what happens is?
Mary's sitting next to you.

1:00:59.003 --> 1:01:02.093
Like, literally,
she's coming at me.

1:01:02.136 --> 1:01:04.399
I'm ----ing sick of people
coming at me, Meredith.

1:01:04.443 --> 1:01:05.662
I'm sick of it.
Tell Mary to stop.

1:01:05.705 --> 1:01:08.229
You're my friend.
Tell her to stop.

1:01:08.273 --> 1:01:10.579
You know what? You can leave
right now, or you can stay,

1:01:10.623 --> 1:01:12.669
but it's conflicting with what
you just said about Jen,

1:01:12.712 --> 1:01:14.018
'cause you just came back,
and you're like,

1:01:14.061 --> 1:01:15.454
"She's the one going
through this,"

1:01:15.497 --> 1:01:16.716
but then she's the reason
you're leaving.

1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:19.327
Because you guys say you are
her friends.

1:01:19.371 --> 1:01:21.808
That's why I'm saying it,
not for me.

1:01:21.852 --> 1:01:24.028
That has nothing to do with me.

1:01:24.071 --> 1:01:25.682
You can sit there
because you're <i>my</i> friend,

1:01:25.725 --> 1:01:27.161
and you can sit there because
you're Jennie's friend,

1:01:27.205 --> 1:01:28.728
but you're my friend.
- It's unpleasant for me.

1:01:28.772 --> 1:01:30.687
It's a negative energy.

1:01:30.730 --> 1:01:33.298
It is toxic, and I don't want it
in my life right now.

1:01:33.341 --> 1:01:37.128
It is not for me.
It is not for me.

1:01:37.171 --> 1:01:39.173
I need you here.
Can you please stay for me?

1:01:39.217 --> 1:01:41.306
Could you
please ----ing stay for me?

1:01:41.349 --> 1:01:43.525
Because you make me feel safe.
Will you please stay for me?

1:01:43.569 --> 1:01:44.962
If you don't stay
for anyone else,

1:01:45.005 --> 1:01:48.748
will you stay for me?
I'm asking you as my friend.

1:01:48.792 --> 1:01:50.837
Please stay for me.

1:01:50.881 --> 1:01:52.534
I will.

1:01:52.578 --> 1:01:55.102
And I understand you.
You know that.

1:01:55.146 --> 1:01:56.887
- Okay.
- Please.

1:01:56.930 --> 1:01:58.540
Okay, please?

1:01:58.584 --> 1:02:01.326
Buckle up, baby.
You got a long road.

1:02:01.369 --> 1:02:03.720
Show your innocence.

1:02:03.763 --> 1:02:05.156
That's what I'm gonna do.

1:02:05.199 --> 1:02:07.811
So let's walk back to that table
knowing that.

1:02:09.464 --> 1:02:11.336
All right, I'm back.

1:02:11.379 --> 1:02:12.337
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

1:02:12.380 --> 1:02:13.860
I am back.

1:02:13.904 --> 1:02:15.862
What did she say that brought
you back to the table?

1:02:15.906 --> 1:02:18.735
She asked me to stay for her.
She wants my support.

1:02:18.778 --> 1:02:20.954
Brrrrp! Bloop! Excuse me.

1:02:20.998 --> 1:02:24.392
Oh! I'm sorry. I'm on your seat.
Come on back.

1:02:24.436 --> 1:02:26.133
Jen, are you okay?

1:02:26.177 --> 1:02:28.440
Sorry we, like, tornadoed you.

1:02:28.483 --> 1:02:32.270
Listen, we've made everything
you're going through about us,

1:02:32.313 --> 1:02:34.402
and the truth is...
- Yeah, it's not. It's not.

1:02:34.446 --> 1:02:36.927
...if anyone at this--
in the world

1:02:36.970 --> 1:02:39.059
understands kind of what
you're facing publicly

1:02:39.103 --> 1:02:42.584
and in terms of, like,
obligation to your family,

1:02:42.628 --> 1:02:46.327
and, like, just responsibility,
it's the women at this table,

1:02:46.371 --> 1:02:48.373
and I think we can all agree
on that.

1:02:48.416 --> 1:02:51.158
- Yes, 100%.
- That we understand.

1:02:51.202 --> 1:02:52.856
This is awful.

1:02:52.899 --> 1:02:55.597
I just wanna
let you guys all know

1:02:55.641 --> 1:02:59.993
I promise...on my kids,
on my husband, on my dad,

1:03:00.037 --> 1:03:03.431
I am innocent.
I did not do any of the things

1:03:03.475 --> 1:03:07.261
that have been alleged
against me.

1:03:07.305 --> 1:03:12.484
I understand everybody needs
to process things on their own,

1:03:12.527 --> 1:03:13.615
and that's okay.

1:03:13.659 --> 1:03:15.922
I know--I know it's a lot.

1:03:15.966 --> 1:03:18.925
The world may seem to be
against you, but it's not.

1:03:18.969 --> 1:03:20.448
And you have people
in your corner.

1:03:20.492 --> 1:03:22.537
Well, I wouldn't say that,
Heather.

1:03:24.496 --> 1:03:27.499
I just...need people
around me that...

1:03:27.542 --> 1:03:29.370
Here. You're gonna drip.

1:03:31.677 --> 1:03:36.595
...that believe in me
and are there for me.

1:03:38.336 --> 1:03:41.078
Really, that's all.

1:03:51.044 --> 1:03:53.655
<i>Next time on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

1:03:53.699 --> 1:03:56.615
Mom, you came over with a plan
to liquidate

1:03:56.658 --> 1:03:57.877
a million dollars for me.

1:03:57.921 --> 1:03:59.705
That's your retirement.

1:03:59.748 --> 1:04:01.272
Mary said, "When you mess
with my church,

1:04:01.315 --> 1:04:03.970
you wind up in jail,"
and Meredith told us

1:04:04.014 --> 1:04:06.320
she hired
a private investigator?

1:04:06.364 --> 1:04:08.801
It's kind of looking like they
both may have known something.

1:04:08.845 --> 1:04:11.151
Where do you stand with Lisa?

1:04:11.195 --> 1:04:12.674
We gotta talk.
I'm, like, so upset right now.

1:04:12.718 --> 1:04:14.241
Yeah, you are continually
attacking me

1:04:14.285 --> 1:04:15.590
and yelling at me, and it's not
boding well for me.

1:04:15.634 --> 1:04:18.463
Oh, that's how--
Oh, okay, bye, Meredith.

1:04:18.506 --> 1:04:20.334
I'm not chasing again.

1:04:20.378 --> 1:04:23.990
Because sometimes you do come
across as two-faced. You do.

1:04:24.034 --> 1:04:26.601
When you referenced
"slanted eyes,"

1:04:26.645 --> 1:04:28.038
you know it's very insulting
to me.

1:04:28.081 --> 1:04:30.605
- I love slanted eyes.
- And you're still saying it.
