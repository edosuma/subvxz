weren't pulled up on charges

31:53.581 --> 31:54.881
- No, no, no, no.

31:54.883 --> 31:56.314
I lost a toe 'cause
of that bastard, so-

31:56.316 --> 31:58.285
- Right, you went there?

32:00.855 --> 32:03.856
- No, I'm sorry, your grace.

32:03.858 --> 32:05.892
Look, our lives are
on the line here.

32:05.894 --> 32:08.994
- The show's over. Get
out the both of yous.

32:08.996 --> 32:10.530
God bless and all that.

32:10.532 --> 32:12.734
- Boys, yous have
said your piece.

32:16.336 --> 32:18.236
- You're making a
mistake, though.

32:18.238 --> 32:19.072
Father!

32:22.009 --> 32:23.611
- Your brother is in Malta.

32:25.012 --> 32:27.713
I don't want you
to get killed, Jay.

32:27.715 --> 32:29.549
The Bishop's a proud man.

32:29.551 --> 32:31.918
There are people eager
to attack the Bishop.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.987
I just don't want his
reputation soiled.

32:35.155 --> 32:36.825
- Thank you, Sister.

32:38.760 --> 32:41.226
- Game on, father of mine.

32:41.228 --> 32:42.829
- You can wipe that
smug look off your face

32:42.831 --> 32:43.763
for a start.

32:43.765 --> 32:44.764
- I'm Kool & the Gang, mate,

32:44.766 --> 32:46.833
but that bastard owes me a toe.

32:46.835 --> 32:50.572
[upbeat music]

32:57.679 --> 32:59.645
- And that was my OBE.

32:59.647 --> 33:01.313
- Order of the British Empire.

33:01.315 --> 33:03.585
- Mm, I love an
intelligent woman.

33:05.118 --> 33:06.554
Smart is so sexy.

33:10.190 --> 33:12.760
[upbeat music]

33:21.335 --> 33:22.737
[knocking on door]

33:30.745 --> 33:31.577
- You have to go.

33:31.579 --> 33:32.812
- Who is it?

33:32.814 --> 33:33.746
- Miranda, I know
you're in there.

33:33.748 --> 33:34.680
- She can't find you here.

33:34.682 --> 33:36.214
- Can't you just tell her?

33:36.216 --> 33:37.917
- Are you a complete
moron? I'm your boss.

33:37.919 --> 33:39.687
This bitch will use
that against me.

33:41.188 --> 33:42.022
Fuck off.

33:45.025 --> 33:46.828
[heavy sigh]

33:50.565 --> 33:51.931
What do you want?

33:51.933 --> 33:53.733
- Where is she?

33:53.735 --> 33:54.569
- Who?

33:56.971 --> 33:59.541
[upbeat music]

34:24.431 --> 34:27.733
- Oh, I've seen this
seduction before.

34:27.735 --> 34:31.235
You are bloody predictable,
if not original.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.340
- Still haven't quite
got the hang of cursing.

34:35.108 --> 34:36.876
- Why have you been
ignoring my voicemails?

34:36.878 --> 34:38.578
- You're not going to Malta.

34:38.580 --> 34:40.178
- The priest is there
with the bearer bonds.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.847
- Yes, and he's being
chased by Alice Baker

34:41.849 --> 34:44.248
and her motley crew.

34:44.251 --> 34:45.985
How's the counseling going?

34:45.987 --> 34:47.452
- I heard you've
been getting updates.

34:47.454 --> 34:48.853
- That's illegal.

34:48.856 --> 34:50.592
Those sessions are
private and confidential.

34:51.759 --> 34:52.992
That being said,

34:52.994 --> 34:54.359
there are a few raised
eyebrows over ending

34:54.360 --> 34:55.628
your career progression.

34:55.630 --> 34:58.030
- Fast-tracked by
your helping hand.

34:58.032 --> 34:59.532
Part of the seduction.

34:59.534 --> 35:01.901
- That is a serious accusation.

35:01.903 --> 35:04.503
- Authorize my trip to
Malta or I go off book.

35:04.505 --> 35:05.805
- Oh, going rogue.

35:05.807 --> 35:07.140
How very daring.

35:08.543 --> 35:10.745
Then again, I never could trust
you to do what you're told.

35:11.913 --> 35:14.346
- That's your thing,
isn't it, Miranda?

35:14.348 --> 35:15.182
Control.

35:16.183 --> 35:18.019
Bullies, love control.

35:19.286 --> 35:24.124
I, uh, checked the
old school records.

35:27.427 --> 35:30.462
It gives me chills thinking
of you in total control.

35:30.464 --> 35:31.833
- What are you doing?

35:33.333 --> 35:35.868
- Miss being this close to you.

35:35.870 --> 35:37.536
- Don't tease me,
I won't change-

35:37.538 --> 35:39.040
- Authorize my trip.

35:39.874 --> 35:41.042
- And if I do?

35:48.281 --> 35:51.451
[gentle guitar music]

35:55.957 --> 35:57.558
- Goodbye, Miranda.

36:02.930 --> 36:04.832
- Oh, Jesus.

36:07.802 --> 36:10.404
[upbeat music]

36:14.709 --> 36:15.641
- Would you forget
about my sister?

36:15.643 --> 36:16.811
This is down to me.

36:17.945 --> 36:20.515
Just get me the damn
flight to Malta.

36:21.716 --> 36:23.918
I don't care how much
it costs, just do it.

36:36.296 --> 36:37.165
[door slamming]

36:39.834 --> 36:42.467
- Sorry I was late,
alarms were going off and-

36:42.469 --> 36:45.137
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

36:45.139 --> 36:46.772
- I was planning on telling you.

36:46.774 --> 36:48.007
I'm not feeling well.

36:48.009 --> 36:49.274
- Are you pregnant?

36:49.276 --> 36:51.177
I don't give a shit
how you're feeling!

36:51.179 --> 36:52.111
- Stop!

36:52.113 --> 36:53.646
Would you calm down, will ya?

36:53.648 --> 36:55.346
- We're under a microscope and
I've gotta hear on the street

36:55.348 --> 36:57.116
that you roughed up
some punk in a club.

36:57.118 --> 36:58.349
- Fuck's sake, Casper always-

36:58.351 --> 37:00.485
- Don't blame fucking Casper.

37:00.487 --> 37:01.721
Harry comes to me,

37:01.723 --> 37:03.122
tells me the police
got a description

37:03.124 --> 37:05.057
and the make of your car.

37:05.059 --> 37:07.593
Why don't you give them
a fucking urine sample?

37:07.595 --> 37:08.828
- The priest was
the one who was-

37:08.830 --> 37:10.295
- Shut up.

37:10.297 --> 37:11.831
That priest outsmarted
you every step of the way.

37:11.833 --> 37:13.999
Now I hear your booking
flights to Malta.

37:14.001 --> 37:14.836
Shut up!

37:16.003 --> 37:17.505
People that do that
wanna get caught.

37:18.806 --> 37:20.206
- You think I just
want to get caught?

37:20.208 --> 37:21.173
- Yeah, you wanna get caught.

37:21.175 --> 37:22.842
I've seen it all before.

37:22.844 --> 37:24.411
Fucking cowboy act.

37:25.980 --> 37:28.182
You just wanna be a
big, bad guy already.

37:29.282 --> 37:30.116
- No, I-

37:30.118 --> 37:30.952
- Shut up!

37:32.720 --> 37:34.854
- These stupids are
gonna mess up everything,

37:34.856 --> 37:36.190
I'm telling you.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.327
- Put 'em on the screen.

37:44.132 --> 37:46.801
[phone ringing]

37:59.614 --> 38:01.247
Have yous got the packages.

38:01.249 --> 38:04.349
- Mm, yeah, just a quick one.

38:04.351 --> 38:05.684
You, you see this?

38:05.686 --> 38:07.686
Like who... can't get it out,

38:07.688 --> 38:09.088
um, uh, who's is this?

38:09.090 --> 38:11.993
Like where, where am
I gonna drop this?

38:13.528 --> 38:15.060
- It's your per diem.

38:15.062 --> 38:15.895
- Absolutely.

38:15.897 --> 38:17.062
Yeah, it's my per diem.

38:17.064 --> 38:19.965
With you there, but where...

38:19.967 --> 38:22.203
who's gonna get, who am
I dropping this off to?

38:25.372 --> 38:26.473
- It's yours.

38:27.809 --> 38:28.810
You keep it.

38:29.677 --> 38:31.409
- What this is mine?

38:31.411 --> 38:33.612
- Fucking idiots.

38:33.614 --> 38:34.880
- Do you get one?

38:34.882 --> 38:35.716
- Yeah.

38:38.553 --> 38:40.619
- Keep your phone charged.

38:40.621 --> 38:43.789
I want those bearer bonds, and
I want that fucking priest.

38:43.791 --> 38:46.025
- Yeah, so crystal...

38:46.027 --> 38:48.060
With ya, crystal clear, yeah.

38:48.062 --> 38:49.728
- You don't speak to anyone
while you're working,

38:49.730 --> 38:52.066
and when you're not working,
you're on call 24 hours a day.

38:53.601 --> 38:56.035
Don't get drunk or do anything
that prevents you from

38:56.037 --> 38:58.270
operating in a
professional manner.

38:58.272 --> 39:00.072
Now tell that back to me.

39:00.074 --> 39:02.241
- You want us to, first of all,

39:02.243 --> 39:03.578
check out the...

39:05.613 --> 39:07.213
- Let him tell me.

39:07.215 --> 39:08.446
- Oh yeah, no, I got it.

39:08.448 --> 39:09.984
I'm with you. Got it, got it.

39:12.153 --> 39:12.987
- Tell me.

39:14.622 --> 39:16.456
- I don't really
know why you've...

39:20.228 --> 39:21.760
Why are they picking on me.

39:21.762 --> 39:23.529
- Because your fucking brother
stole my fucking bearer bonds

39:23.531 --> 39:25.333
and I don't like
you, you cocksucker.

39:26.767 --> 39:28.135
- It's my half-brother.

39:29.270 --> 39:30.437
- We're on it.

[instrumental music]

40:00.701 --> 40:02.501
[laughs]

40:02.503 --> 40:03.903
- Come here.

40:03.905 --> 40:05.470
You are in for it now, you are.

40:05.472 --> 40:06.705
- Yeah, not if I get you first.

40:06.707 --> 40:09.575
- Ah, you horny little devil.

40:09.577 --> 40:11.877
- You promised to
take me shopping.

40:11.879 --> 40:15.114
- Stop being so fucking
relentless with that, Agnes.

40:15.116 --> 40:16.348
I'm working on it.

40:16.350 --> 40:18.653
- Yeah, and you've been
saying that for weeks.

40:20.453 --> 40:21.620
- Ah, fuck.

40:21.622 --> 40:23.656
- What, why are you leaving?

40:23.658 --> 40:24.757
You said we had all afternoon.

40:24.759 --> 40:26.892
- I've got somewhere to be.

40:26.894 --> 40:28.360
Stop acting like a little child.

40:28.362 --> 40:29.995
- Where the hell were you?

40:29.997 --> 40:31.365
We had to get the boss.

40:32.566 --> 40:33.866
Who's the tart?

40:33.868 --> 40:35.067
- Just a local.

40:35.069 --> 40:35.903
- Dick.

40:38.172 --> 40:39.638
- Whore trouble.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.374
So my dear, tell your
brother where you were.

40:42.376 --> 40:44.845
- I felt it better than
drawin' attention to us.

40:46.247 --> 40:47.313
- How are you brother Kraut?

40:47.315 --> 40:48.747
- We didn't get the money.

40:48.749 --> 40:50.049
What did my brother say?

40:50.051 --> 40:52.450
- Wee shit's workin'
with Alice Baker.

40:52.452 --> 40:53.852
- Shit!

40:53.854 --> 40:56.021
- Your father too,
apparently, by all accounts.

40:56.023 --> 40:57.658
- No, not my father.

40:59.093 --> 41:00.661
They must have turned up
the pressure on my old man.

41:02.063 --> 41:04.596
- You act naturally as
if there's nothing wrong.

41:04.598 --> 41:07.802
We can't let them know that
we made a deal with a Kraut.

41:08.970 --> 41:10.970
- I got mass in half an hour.

41:10.972 --> 41:12.404
- Message the Kraut.

41:12.406 --> 41:14.141
Tell him I'll meet him after.

41:16.978 --> 41:20.047
[instrumental music]

41:46.140 --> 41:48.107
[laughs]

41:48.109 --> 41:49.975
- Nice pinny.

41:49.977 --> 41:51.143
Is my sister home yet?

41:51.145 --> 41:52.644
- No.

41:52.646 --> 41:54.248
- Well, then I accept your
invitation to come in.

41:55.516 --> 41:56.515
- She'll be back in a minute.

41:56.517 --> 41:58.219
- Slap the kettle on.

42:00.521 --> 42:01.455
[door slamming]

42:09.397 --> 42:11.132
Silence is deafenin'.

42:11.966 --> 42:12.831
And you know what?

42:12.833 --> 42:13.667
- And?

42:14.602 --> 42:16.170
There's no problem.

42:18.672 --> 42:21.407
- Alice has set this up.

42:21.409 --> 42:24.610
A bastard priest,
the bearer bonds.

42:24.612 --> 42:25.980
- The priest stole 'em from you.

42:28.015 --> 42:30.249
- Alice is losing her mind
'cause of this pregnancy

42:30.251 --> 42:31.552
and you, you're no help.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.153
You know, we take
care of that priest

42:34.155 --> 42:35.954
and everyone else
will fall into line.

42:35.956 --> 42:39.358
- Oi, Alice is the boss.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.760
- Yeah, and she's months
off from maternity.

42:41.762 --> 42:43.197
Then it's just you
and me, brother.

42:44.265 --> 42:46.932
Telling you, we do this right,

42:46.934 --> 42:49.270
We play this whole
town like a fiddle.

42:56.410 --> 42:58.210
We hit Malta running, yeah?

42:58.212 --> 42:59.478
Take care of the priest.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.347
Get the bearer bonds and
nothing else matters.

43:02.349 --> 43:04.452
- I can't go to frickin' Malta.

43:05.554 --> 43:06.718
The birth of me son.

43:06.720 --> 43:08.854
- She won't even
know that we're gone.

43:08.856 --> 43:10.724
We're back tomorrow, and boom.

43:14.895 --> 43:19.633
- If I miss the birth of
my son, I'll kill you.

43:21.735 --> 43:23.804
- It's a fair, fair deal.

43:25.005 --> 43:26.605
Come on Casper.

43:26.607 --> 43:28.476
You know this makes sense.

43:31.879 --> 43:33.779
- All right, I'll do it.

43:33.781 --> 43:37.716
But, I'm taking me foot massager

43:37.718 --> 43:40.452
and me Austrian Christmas music.

43:40.454 --> 43:42.289
- Hey honey, I'm home.

43:46.528 --> 43:48.129
There you are, I
was wondering...

43:49.363 --> 43:50.863
Why are you blocking the door?

43:50.865 --> 43:53.000
- Sorry, I was just
folding some clothes.

43:58.405 --> 43:59.705
- I'm so tired.

43:59.707 --> 44:01.876
Traffic was a nightmare
down the road.

44:05.514 --> 44:06.979
Has my brother been here?

44:06.981 --> 44:07.815
- No.

44:09.917 --> 44:12.784
Listen, I am taking you
out for dinner tonight.

44:12.786 --> 44:14.987
- Ah, I'm beat Casper.

44:14.989 --> 44:16.188
- Oh, come on.

44:16.190 --> 44:17.189
I've booked a table
and everything.

44:17.191 --> 44:18.591
- What?

44:18.593 --> 44:20.926
No, I'm not made up to go out.

44:20.928 --> 44:22.494
- Oh forget the
Oompa Loompa look.

44:22.496 --> 44:24.663
You look fantastic
without makeup.

44:24.665 --> 44:27.368
- I'm not going anywhere
without my face on, Mister.

44:33.774 --> 44:35.107
Okay, okay.

44:35.109 --> 44:38.710
I'll go if you give
me a foot massage.

44:38.712 --> 44:40.345
My feet are killing me.

44:40.347 --> 44:41.182
Oh.

44:44.418 --> 44:45.920
Yeah, that's good.

44:48.255 --> 44:50.088
Mm, just there, yeah.

44:50.090 --> 44:51.526
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:52.693 --> 44:57.498
Oh my, oh babe that is
really doing it for me.

44:58.465 --> 45:00.535
[laughs]

45:02.537 --> 45:03.370
Come here.

45:06.508 --> 45:08.742
I'm wearing your
favorite underwear.

45:09.843 --> 45:11.109
- What about the baby?

45:11.111 --> 45:13.447
- Sh, doctor says it's fine.

45:19.019 --> 45:21.188
[kissing]

45:25.893 --> 45:28.563
[plane landing]

45:33.267 --> 45:34.500
- There is no choice.

45:34.502 --> 45:35.702
- 'Cause you'll
always choose him.

45:35.704 --> 45:37.035
'Cause he's your favorite.

45:37.037 --> 45:38.270
- I'm not listening,
I'm done with this.

45:38.272 --> 45:39.071
- Ah, I know what
you're thinking.

45:39.073 --> 45:40.573
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:40.575 --> 45:42.074
You're thinking when all
the dust settles and that

45:42.076 --> 45:43.643
we're gonna go back and we're
just gonna play happy fams.

45:43.645 --> 45:45.944
I-I'm telling you now
that is not gonna happen.

45:45.946 --> 45:47.379
- He deserves another chance.

45:47.381 --> 45:48.747
- Ah, yeah, you just
remember who stuck by you

45:48.749 --> 45:49.915
all these years.

45:49.917 --> 45:52.019
- As if you'd let me forget it.

46:04.431 --> 46:05.632
- Here you are.

46:05.634 --> 46:07.234
You're on the front
cover, you dick.

46:12.273 --> 46:14.875
[upbeat music]

46:44.171 --> 46:47.640
- Right, when we get in there,
I'm gonna do the talking.

46:47.642 --> 46:49.141
- How'd that work out before?

46:49.143 --> 46:50.842
- You said I could
take the lead.

46:50.844 --> 46:52.547
- All right, all right.

46:59.453 --> 47:03.625
- In the name of the father,
the son, and the holy spirit.

47:05.492 --> 47:06.327
Amen.

47:08.896 --> 47:10.862
- Sweet Jesus, Jay.

47:10.864 --> 47:12.064
You almost gave
me a heart attack!

47:12.066 --> 47:14.232
- Sorry about that, Father.

47:14.234 --> 47:15.233
- Right?

47:15.235 --> 47:16.168
Mass is over.

47:16.170 --> 47:17.071
There's no confession tonight.

47:18.405 --> 47:20.140
- So what's the
crack, then, brother?

47:22.009 --> 47:23.008
- Jay.

47:23.010 --> 47:23.975
What happened to your foot?

47:23.977 --> 47:25.745
- Rory shot me.

47:25.747 --> 47:29.917
We almost died 'cause of
you, you fuckin' asshole.

47:31.118 --> 47:32.685
- I bet there was
a woman involved.

47:32.687 --> 47:34.953
- Oh, don't, I, okay...

47:34.955 --> 47:36.855
I'm not the only one who knows
you're here, you're here.

47:36.857 --> 47:38.423
Yeah, that Alice, Alice Baker.

47:38.425 --> 47:39.659
She knows you're here as well.

47:39.661 --> 47:40.959
- That's a horse of
a different color.

47:40.961 --> 47:42.427
- No, I'm taking you back.

47:42.429 --> 47:44.863
You and the bastard bearer
bonds, we're gonna...

47:44.865 --> 47:46.634
What, just like that?

47:48.235 --> 47:49.968
- Do you want me
to beg and plead?

47:49.970 --> 47:51.203
- Yeah, be a start.

47:51.205 --> 47:52.371
- All right, all
right, wait there.

47:52.373 --> 47:53.808
I'm gonna get my
keys from the vestry.

47:56.176 --> 47:58.410
- No, but wait, hang on!

47:58.412 --> 48:00.212
Slippery bastard, get back here.

48:00.214 --> 48:01.014
Fuck.

48:07.254 --> 48:08.487
- Are you all right
in there, Father?

48:08.489 --> 48:10.859
- Yes, just, just
looking for my keys.

48:11.992 --> 48:14.226
- The door appears
to be locked, Father.

48:14.228 --> 48:15.797
- It's a bit heavy.

48:17.431 --> 48:18.265
- Wanker.

48:22.570 --> 48:24.806
[grunting]

48:25.939 --> 48:28.106
- Is the front door
locked, Father?

48:28.108 --> 48:29.307
- Hello, Dad.

48:29.309 --> 48:31.744
[laughing]

48:31.746 --> 48:32.814
- Wait, wait!

48:36.984 --> 48:40.553
[car engine rumbling]

48:40.555 --> 48:42.990
[struggling]

48:44.124 --> 48:47.627
- Ladies, put the handbags away.

48:47.629 --> 48:49.161
Hey, hey, hey.

48:49.163 --> 48:51.432
Hey, you have had your say.

48:53.668 --> 48:56.403
- All right, I'll
buy some pints.

48:57.404 --> 48:58.338
Start over.

49:01.576 --> 49:04.176
- You're gonna let him get
away with this, ain't you?

49:04.178 --> 49:05.645
- He said he's sorry.

49:05.647 --> 49:07.715
What more do you
want, jam with it?

49:21.830 --> 49:24.398
[upbeat music]

49:27.635 --> 49:30.505
We get somethin' to
eat and we're gone.

49:32.640 --> 49:34.576
Agreed or we leave.

49:35.710 --> 49:36.876
- It's all right, landlady.

49:36.878 --> 49:37.844
It's only me.

49:37.846 --> 49:39.344
- Oh, hello, asshole.

49:39.346 --> 49:40.615
I mean, Father.

49:41.816 --> 49:43.381
Didn't realize it was you.

49:43.383 --> 49:45.118
I thought it was just
one of the normal people.

49:47.287 --> 49:49.289
Take any table you want.

50:01.134 --> 50:01.970
- Ah, Jay.

50:03.237 --> 50:04.504
- What's up with her?

50:04.506 --> 50:05.339
Don't ask.

50:07.040 --> 50:09.343
Is there any table service
in this place then?

50:13.080 --> 50:14.580
- What do you want?

50:14.582 --> 50:17.484
- Gorgeous, gorgeous Gilman.

50:18.485 --> 50:19.351
Meet my brother Jay.

50:19.353 --> 50:21.052
- Oh, another asshole.

50:21.054 --> 50:23.056
- Yeah, she seems to know you.

50:25.292 --> 50:27.094
- We're only after a menu.

50:31.164 --> 50:33.633
- What do you think then, bruv?

50:33.635 --> 50:35.100
- Seems to like you.

50:35.102 --> 50:36.436
Got no idea why.

50:40.942 --> 50:42.240
- Right, then, Agnes.

50:42.242 --> 50:43.876
I guess it's pints all
around, then, yeah?

50:43.878 --> 50:45.245
- Hey, let's not.

50:47.347 --> 50:48.881
It'll not go well.

50:48.883 --> 50:50.315
- All right. You guys
caught me fair enough.

50:50.317 --> 50:51.817
Round of applause.

50:51.819 --> 50:53.819
You can't deny a dead man
walking his last pint.

50:53.821 --> 50:54.622
- I would.

50:59.192 --> 51:03.161
- All right, what will
make you happy then, Agnes?

51:03.163 --> 51:07.833
- Hmm, your head on a stake.

51:07.835 --> 51:11.003
- I'll have the super
duper hot dog surprise,

51:11.005 --> 51:13.104
with extra mustard.

51:13.106 --> 51:14.540
What's the surprise?

51:14.542 --> 51:16.443
- That you're even getting one.

51:19.013 --> 51:20.378
- Same.

51:20.380 --> 51:21.749
- I'll take the same as well.

51:25.185 --> 51:27.319
- Lose the ridiculous costume.

51:27.321 --> 51:29.822
[laughs]

51:29.824 --> 51:31.489
She still thinks
you're a priest.

51:31.491 --> 51:33.993
- Listen, she's into
authority figures, all right?

51:33.995 --> 51:37.029
[laughing]

51:37.031 --> 51:39.164
- You're not gonna
give him back, are you?

51:39.166 --> 51:40.800
- Of course he is.

51:40.802 --> 51:43.134
I've got confidence
that our father

51:43.136 --> 51:46.005
has got this cunning,
masterful plan.

51:46.007 --> 51:48.239
[laughing]

51:48.241 --> 51:50.610
- Alice Baker and her
gang are miles away.

51:50.612 --> 51:53.278
- We are gonna hand the bearer
bonds back to the agent.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.247
- Of course.

51:55.750 --> 51:57.382
But I'm not handing him over.

51:57.384 --> 52:00.553
- You think this agent has
got this lucrative government

52:00.555 --> 52:03.623
witness protection and a
house out in the suburbs.

52:03.625 --> 52:04.557
For what?

52:04.559 --> 52:06.291
For a monthly salary bonus?

52:06.293 --> 52:08.894
You're smarter than that.

52:08.896 --> 52:11.733
- We're technically
not witnesses.

52:18.372 --> 52:19.639
- Oi, go easy.

52:19.641 --> 52:20.840
- What?

52:20.842 --> 52:23.241
- The car, big deposit.

52:23.243 --> 52:25.945
- Why did you hire a
sports car, anyway?

52:25.947 --> 52:29.280
- You wanna drive around
in crap, you hire it.

52:29.282 --> 52:30.215
Shirt's sticking to me.

52:30.217 --> 52:31.584
How far to the hotel?

52:31.586 --> 52:33.186
- There's no hotel.

52:34.221 --> 52:35.821
We have a flight in the morning.

52:35.823 --> 52:37.992
- I need a fucking shower, Rory.

52:39.426 --> 52:40.893
- I don't get this country.

52:40.895 --> 52:42.262
There's no signal anywhere.

52:43.363 --> 52:44.295
I mean, if we can't
have a signal,

52:44.297 --> 52:45.332
we don't find these idiots.

52:46.366 --> 52:47.969
- Wifi at an hotel.

52:49.537 --> 52:51.639
- Touche, touche.

52:58.780 --> 53:01.348
[intense music]

53:10.323 --> 53:13.995
[motorcycle engine roaring]

53:41.622 --> 53:43.691
The wifi is shit in here.

53:44.859 --> 53:46.525
- Need to do it
old school, Rory.

53:46.527 --> 53:47.693
With our feet.

53:47.695 --> 53:49.161
- Old school.

53:49.163 --> 53:53.331
Nah, spoil the leather
on your shoes doin' that.

53:53.333 --> 53:56.535
I mean, I'm getting wifi, but

53:56.537 --> 53:58.072
I'm not getting
any signal off it.

54:00.340 --> 54:01.140
Here, you have a new phone.

54:01.142 --> 54:02.242
Give us that.

54:03.477 --> 54:05.410
- Phone's switched off.

54:05.412 --> 54:06.614
- Porquoi?

54:08.015 --> 54:10.750
- Alice don't know where I am.

54:10.752 --> 54:12.854
[laughs]

54:14.254 --> 54:16.124
- Don't tell me
she's tracking you.

54:17.859 --> 54:19.493
You put up with that shit.

54:21.229 --> 54:22.962
Fuck, just give us it.

54:22.964 --> 54:24.766
Only two minutes, I'll
switch it right off.

54:26.200 --> 54:27.566
Come on, it's the least you
can do after recent trauma

54:27.568 --> 54:28.667
you put me through.

54:28.669 --> 54:29.835
- No.

54:29.837 --> 54:30.569
- Just give us
your fuckin' phone.

54:30.571 --> 54:31.771
- No!

54:31.773 --> 54:33.239
- The faster we find
these two idiots

54:33.241 --> 54:34.039
the faster you can go home
to your crazy wife and

54:34.041 --> 54:35.843
your new unborn family.

54:40.447 --> 54:44.183
- Two minutes and turn
it off straight after.

54:44.185 --> 54:45.186
- Thank you.

54:46.087 --> 54:47.522
Very nice of you.

54:49.724 --> 54:51.526
- My brother turned
up unexpectedly.

54:53.393 --> 54:55.530
If you've got it all then
we can make the exchange.

54:56.998 --> 54:58.329
Half.

54:58.331 --> 55:00.065
Are you havin' a fuckin'
bubble about half?

55:00.067 --> 55:00.835
I want it-

55:01.702 --> 55:03.836
- Listen, you dumb Kraut.

55:03.838 --> 55:06.073
Don't mess us about
or I won't be pleased.

55:07.875 --> 55:10.310
Give us our money or we walk.

55:21.088 --> 55:24.258
[gentle guitar music]

55:36.504 --> 55:37.837
- Why are they here?

55:37.839 --> 55:39.337
- Clearly Rory
doesn't trust you.

55:39.339 --> 55:41.173
- Okay, but is it just my
brother he doesn't trust

55:41.175 --> 55:42.844
or is it us as well?

55:44.612 --> 55:46.512
Look, can you get
us out of this?

55:46.514 --> 55:48.147
- The bearer bonds
have to go back, Jay.

55:48.149 --> 55:49.815
If the priest testifies, we
might be able to do a deal

55:49.817 --> 55:50.749
on a lower sentence.

55:50.751 --> 55:52.017
- He's not a priest, is he?

55:52.019 --> 55:53.654
- Quiet life is very
appealing right now.

55:55.690 --> 55:57.488
- I know it's not gonna happen.

55:57.490 --> 56:00.628
- Jay, you should know that
the priest isn't running this.

56:02.263 --> 56:05.664
- I mean, I had my
suspicions, but makes sense.

56:05.666 --> 56:07.800
You know, he always
was the favorite.

56:07.802 --> 56:09.034
- He stayed to protect you.

56:09.036 --> 56:10.470
- No, it was probably
guilt though, wasn't it?

56:15.042 --> 56:17.044
- I'll be on the
docks in an hour.

56:26.921 --> 56:27.855
Quiet life.

56:34.896 --> 56:37.164
[laughing]

56:47.909 --> 56:49.677
- What's up with you?

56:50.611 --> 56:51.946
- Mixed signals.

56:58.252 --> 56:59.320
I'm gonna go.

57:00.321 --> 57:01.822
- She told you, didn't she?

57:07.261 --> 57:09.764
[tense music]

57:10.965 --> 57:13.632
- I've got nothing to
say to you right now.

57:13.634 --> 57:14.934
- It isn't how it was.

57:14.936 --> 57:16.502
- I'm just gonna go.

57:16.504 --> 57:17.905
Drain the lizard.

57:20.975 --> 57:22.041
- All right, lads.

57:22.043 --> 57:23.544
What can I get for you?

57:25.445 --> 57:27.447
- Conversation with these two?

57:29.050 --> 57:30.316
- I did my best for you.

57:30.318 --> 57:32.485
- Yeah, why doesn't it
feel like that, then?

57:34.088 --> 57:36.190
- You're owed an
explanation, obviously.

57:39.393 --> 57:41.260
- You never hit a
man with glasses.

57:41.262 --> 57:42.897
You hit him with a baseball bat.

57:49.570 --> 57:52.073
[tense music]

58:09.957 --> 58:12.693
[waves crashing]

58:15.629 --> 58:18.097
- Do you wanna explain to
me how, how all of a sudden

58:18.099 --> 58:19.398
you are some sort

01:05:00.602 --> 01:05:02.467
They killed my father and my
brother, according to her.

01:05:02.469 --> 01:05:05.971
- We have to lose the costumes,
we'll be too easy to spot.

01:05:05.973 --> 01:05:08.206
- We'll dump them after the
Germans hand over the cash.

Have you made up with him?

01:11:01.428 --> 01:11:05.099
[motorcycle engine roaring]

01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:57.550
- You're mine now, you fuck.

01:11:57.552 --> 01:12:00.351
[gun shots]

01:12:00.353 --> 01:12:01.889
- They're shooting!

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.693
[motorcycle engine roaring]

01:12:07.695 --> 01:12:10.031
[gun shots]

01:12:11.966 --> 01:12:14.302
[screaming]

01:12:15.303 --> 01:12:16.137
Bastards!

01:12:19.273 --> 01:12:20.139
[laughing]

01:12:20.141 --> 01:12:21.874
[gun shots]

01:12:21.876 --> 01:12:24.912
- Will you stop firing
at me fucking car?

01:12:28.015 --> 01:12:29.849
[screaming]

01:12:29.851 --> 01:12:30.751
- Bastards!

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:34.822
- Oh, Hallelujah.

01:12:36.023 --> 01:12:37.388
[screaming]

01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:40.228
[engines roaring]

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.236
- Asshole.

01:12:56.376 --> 01:12:57.912
[gunshot]

01:12:59.714 --> 01:13:01.115
[motorcycle engine roaring]

01:13:08.356 --> 01:13:09.521
- You're being a baby.

01:13:09.523 --> 01:13:12.124
- Hm, you like her don't you?

01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:14.392
- I have not forgiven you yet.

01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:15.828
- I know.

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:18.631
- It's just a graze,
but keep it clean.

01:13:18.633 --> 01:13:20.866
Jay, there's a
hotel by the coast.

01:13:20.868 --> 01:13:22.336
They're friendly,
you can go there.

01:13:25.106 --> 01:13:27.039
How are you doing?

01:13:27.041 --> 01:13:28.609
- Yeah, strangely all right.

01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:31.478
- Keep it clean.

01:13:32.479 --> 01:13:34.613
- If he doesn't, will he die?

01:13:34.615 --> 01:13:36.215
- It might take awhile.

01:13:36.217 --> 01:13:37.652
- We've got time.

01:13:39.353 --> 01:13:40.853
- Where's the troops?

01:13:40.855 --> 01:13:42.453
- They're on their way, but
you need to hide from Rory

01:13:42.455 --> 01:13:44.089
and his pet gorilla.

01:13:44.091 --> 01:13:45.425
- Oh, fantastic.

01:13:50.064 --> 01:13:51.299
She is amazing.

01:13:52.533 --> 01:13:54.368
- Yeah, I know.

01:13:56.137 --> 01:13:56.971
- What?

01:14:01.776 --> 01:14:02.944
- Fuck's sake.

01:14:06.347 --> 01:14:09.648
[waves crashing]

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:12.184
- That agent, she
was easy on the eye.

01:14:12.186 --> 01:14:13.352
- Hey, no, no, no, no.

01:14:13.354 --> 01:14:15.187
You don't get to
talk about her, ever.

01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:17.056
- We had this moment,
you know, look.

01:14:17.058 --> 01:14:18.290
I'm saying she didn't give-

01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:19.490
- Seriously, you
want to start again?

01:14:19.492 --> 01:14:20.359
Are we doing this again?

01:14:20.361 --> 01:14:22.261
- The both of ya.

01:14:22.263 --> 01:14:24.997
- It's like a long weekend
with Zippy and Bongo.

01:14:24.999 --> 01:14:26.432
Can't take a joke.

01:14:26.434 --> 01:14:27.635
- Give him some space.

01:14:28.636 --> 01:14:30.602
In fact, the both of us.

01:14:30.604 --> 01:14:32.873
- You're the one that decided
to go back and protect him.

01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:37.142
- I saw what you did
with the bearer bonds.

01:14:37.144 --> 01:14:38.212
[sniffs]

01:14:46.787 --> 01:14:48.520
- Well, bang goes me deposit.

01:14:48.522 --> 01:14:50.923
Fucking big deposit.

01:14:50.925 --> 01:14:52.891
- Yeah, think on
the bright side,

01:14:52.893 --> 01:14:54.393
you know, it used to
symbolize how much you earned,

01:14:54.395 --> 01:14:55.963
now it symbolizes
how much you owe.

01:14:57.064 --> 01:14:57.898
- What?

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.467
This is all your fault.

01:15:01.469 --> 01:15:02.768
- My fault?

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:04.505
I didn't steal the
fuckin' car, did I?

01:15:05.706 --> 01:15:07.639
Look, we'll get someone
to fix it, don't worry.

01:15:07.641 --> 01:15:10.209
[phone vibrating]

01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:11.643
- Geez.

01:15:11.645 --> 01:15:13.547
- So you're returning
me calls now, are you?

01:15:14.815 --> 01:15:15.914
Yeah, relax.

01:15:15.916 --> 01:15:17.485
We have them in our sights.

01:15:22.089 --> 01:15:22.923
Oh, uh...

01:15:24.992 --> 01:15:26.594
Casper, it's a boy.

01:15:29.063 --> 01:15:29.897
- Alice?

01:15:32.133 --> 01:15:32.967
Alice!

01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:37.738
She fucking hung up.

01:15:41.175 --> 01:15:43.442
Told me not to
bother going home.

01:15:43.444 --> 01:15:45.544
- That's, it's probably
just the heat of the moment.

01:15:45.546 --> 01:15:47.579
It'll be fine when we
get back, you know?

01:15:47.581 --> 01:15:49.081
Look, you always wanted
a boy, didn't you?

01:15:49.083 --> 01:15:51.520
So congratulations.

01:15:53.454 --> 01:15:54.686
Hey man, I'm sorry, I...

01:15:54.688 --> 01:15:56.155
- Fuck you!

01:15:56.157 --> 01:15:57.189
- Casper, come on.

01:15:57.191 --> 01:15:58.123
- Fuck you.

01:15:58.125 --> 01:15:59.024
- Fuck you going?

01:15:59.026 --> 01:15:59.927
- Fuck you!

01:16:01.095 --> 01:16:04.131
- Casper! Oh, for
God's sake, Casper.

01:16:11.506 --> 01:16:15.342
[gentle guitar music playing]

01:16:25.986 --> 01:16:29.256
- Jay, I'm sorry man.

01:16:30.124 --> 01:16:31.824
- You were told to be quiet.

01:16:31.826 --> 01:16:33.992
- All I was trying
to do was apologize.

01:16:33.994 --> 01:16:36.531
- I know the value
of your apologies.

01:16:37.765 --> 01:16:39.164
- All right, you guys go ahead.

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:40.868
Give me two seconds,
man, I just want to pee.

01:16:47.374 --> 01:16:50.242
- Oh, for fuck's sake, just...

01:16:50.244 --> 01:16:51.812
- Well, well, well.

01:16:53.948 --> 01:16:55.550
Where's the priest?

01:17:01.021 --> 01:17:02.256
- I killed him.

01:17:03.424 --> 01:17:06.492
- I've met many men,
done many deeds.

01:17:06.494 --> 01:17:08.929
You two are not cruel.

01:17:11.699 --> 01:17:13.868
Where's the fucking bonds?

01:17:16.303 --> 01:17:17.805
- Killed them too.

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.874
Do you know, I'm, I'm
actually just a bit,

01:17:21.876 --> 01:17:23.342
a bit fed up with this mate.

01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:24.511
You're, you're, you're...
doing my nut right in.

01:17:24.513 --> 01:17:25.711
Yeah, tell you
what, tell you what,

01:17:25.713 --> 01:17:27.479
if you carry on the
way you're going, then,

01:17:27.481 --> 01:17:30.284
then I'm gonna kill you too.

01:17:31.118 --> 01:17:33.354
[laughing]

01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:41.328
[bells ringing]

01:18:28.008 --> 01:18:30.275
- Guess me specialty.

01:18:30.277 --> 01:18:31.546
- Oral hygiene.

01:18:40.087 --> 01:18:41.755
- I can't kill Rory.

01:18:42.923 --> 01:18:44.723
So you're gonna have to pay.

01:18:44.725 --> 01:18:46.258
- Well, with respect, mate,

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:48.994
I've already been flung off a
cliff and made to run through

01:18:48.996 --> 01:18:51.396
the middle of Malta
in my bastard pants.

01:18:51.398 --> 01:18:54.401
So, I, I, I kind of think
I've, I've paid enough.

01:18:58.405 --> 01:19:00.908
- I missed the birth of me son.

01:19:03.077 --> 01:19:05.145
I should have been there.

01:19:07.081 --> 01:19:10.985
Instead I'm friggin' over
here chasing stupids.

01:19:32.741 --> 01:19:34.141
This should help.

01:19:42.182 --> 01:19:44.285
[groans]

01:19:46.887 --> 01:19:49.890
- Course, you should have
swabbed it with alcohol.

01:19:52.126 --> 01:19:54.194
I might get an infection.

01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:57.429
- What is it?

01:19:57.431 --> 01:20:01.101
- Sodium amytal or
some other truth drug.

01:20:02.737 --> 01:20:04.169
- Makes you tell the truth?

01:20:04.171 --> 01:20:05.003
- Yep.

01:20:05.005 --> 01:20:06.138
- Does it work?

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.806
[sighs]

01:20:07.808 --> 01:20:08.643
- Yep.

01:20:12.813 --> 01:20:14.649
Ask me somethin' I'd lie about.

01:20:17.719 --> 01:20:19.851
- Are we gonna die?

01:20:19.853 --> 01:20:20.787
- Yep.

01:20:20.789 --> 01:20:22.389
- Fuck it works, then, don't it?

01:20:24.693 --> 01:20:26.761
- He's gonna
torture us to death.

01:20:29.731 --> 01:20:31.398
Or slit our throats.

01:20:33.702 --> 01:20:34.667
Or bury us alive.

01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:35.802
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:20:35.804 --> 01:20:38.038
Leave it off, fuckin' hell.

01:20:50.150 --> 01:20:52.286
- Were you gonna leave me?

01:20:54.789 --> 01:20:56.855
- Can't ask me that,
I won't answer.

01:20:56.857 --> 01:20:58.660
- No, no, now come on.

01:20:59.893 --> 01:21:01.796
Were you gonna leave me?

01:21:02.764 --> 01:21:03.598
- Yes.

01:21:12.574 --> 01:21:14.906
- Why'd you come back?

01:21:14.908 --> 01:21:17.744
- You're my son. I
couldn't leave you.

01:21:17.746 --> 01:21:20.780
- No, no, you're a fucking...

01:21:20.782 --> 01:21:22.717
You're a scumbag, mate.

01:21:23.785 --> 01:21:27.388
- Yeah, I'm a lying scumbag.

01:21:49.878 --> 01:21:52.847
[breathing heavily]

01:22:00.588 --> 01:22:02.156
- I'm not a psychopath.

01:22:04.191 --> 01:22:06.460
But you might think I am
by the time I'm finished.

01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:10.732
[laughs]

01:22:13.835 --> 01:22:16.935
- I know something
you don't know.

01:22:16.937 --> 01:22:18.905
[laughs]

01:22:18.907 --> 01:22:21.741
I know something you don't know.

01:22:21.743 --> 01:22:23.812
- Dad, what are you doing?

01:22:24.712 --> 01:22:26.178
- We're gonna get outta here.

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:28.248
[laughs]

01:22:33.086 --> 01:22:34.587
You know those ropes.

01:22:34.589 --> 01:22:37.255
[laughs]

01:22:37.257 --> 01:22:38.593
I loosened them.

01:22:39.493 --> 01:22:41.627
- Get him, Dad! Dad, get him!

01:22:41.629 --> 01:22:44.398
Choke, come on,
Dad, go on Dad...

01:22:45.533 --> 01:22:46.366
- Ow!

01:22:47.836 --> 01:22:50.003
[panting]

01:22:57.144 --> 01:23:02.015
- I'm gonna kill your son
and make you fucking watch.

01:23:03.818 --> 01:23:04.652
- Oi!

01:23:07.589 --> 01:23:10.257
[blows landing]

01:23:12.861 --> 01:23:14.326
- Don't, no, no, no, no, no...

01:23:14.328 --> 01:23:15.761
Just let her go.

01:23:15.763 --> 01:23:18.296
- I could never hit a
woman, but I can shoot one.

01:23:18.298 --> 01:23:20.733
- Get him Dad! Go on, get him!

01:23:20.735 --> 01:23:23.170
[struggling]

01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:31.345
[dramatic music]

01:23:35.015 --> 01:23:37.148
No, just let him go, please!

01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:37.986
Please!

01:23:40.354 --> 01:23:43.190
[heavy breathing]

01:23:44.692 --> 01:23:46.360
You could come with.

01:23:47.227 --> 01:23:48.161
- Trust me.

01:23:51.566 --> 01:23:53.966
- Why don't you curse?

01:23:53.968 --> 01:23:55.235
- Leave him, just
leave him alone.

01:23:58.238 --> 01:23:59.872
- 'Cause he was a good person.

01:23:59.874 --> 01:24:01.439
- You're a fucking idiot
who never figured out

01:24:01.441 --> 01:24:04.077
that all these flashy moves
are better on a chorus line.

01:24:05.212 --> 01:24:06.311
This is the job.

01:24:06.313 --> 01:24:09.316
[music intensifies]

01:24:19.126 --> 01:24:20.862
- Leave him, just
leave him alone...

01:24:22.396 --> 01:24:23.261
[grunting]

01:24:23.263 --> 01:24:25.463
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:24:25.465 --> 01:24:26.300
It's over.

01:24:27.835 --> 01:24:30.237
[struggling]

01:24:31.104 --> 01:24:33.775
[intense music]

01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:50.525
[heavy breathing]

01:24:56.064 --> 01:24:56.998
- You okay?

01:24:58.265 --> 01:24:59.599
- Yeah, you?

01:24:59.601 --> 01:25:01.667
- Just gimme a minute.

01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:03.905
Come on, come on, let's go.

01:25:07.909 --> 01:25:10.678
[waves crashing]

01:25:14.582 --> 01:25:15.516
- Oh, shit.

01:25:17.217 --> 01:25:19.887
[intense music]

01:25:20.788 --> 01:25:21.889
- Wait there.

01:25:32.734 --> 01:25:35.003
[coughing]

01:25:38.006 --> 01:25:40.940
- All I wanna know is
where the bearer bonds are.

01:25:40.942 --> 01:25:43.377
Huh? And then we can go home.

01:25:44.545 --> 01:25:47.412
