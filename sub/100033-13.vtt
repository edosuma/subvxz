WEBVTT

00:46.872 --> 00:48.744
- She's rejecting
her heart transplant.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.615
- So University
stuffed her in a limo--

00:50.659 --> 00:52.226
- Drove across town--
- And dropped her

00:52.269 --> 00:53.618
at our doorstep.
- Just makes you feel

00:53.662 --> 00:56.186
all warm and fuzzy inside,
doesn't it?

00:56.230 --> 00:57.535
- Ms. Harris?

00:57.579 --> 00:58.797
I'm Max Goodwin,
the Medical Director.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.364
Did your doctors tell you why

01:00.408 --> 01:02.584
they were transferring you
to New Amsterdam?

01:02.627 --> 01:05.543
- They said
you'd be better equipped

01:05.587 --> 01:07.589
to handle my needs.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.201
Is something wrong?

01:11.245 --> 01:12.637
- Uh, they lied to you.

01:12.681 --> 01:15.075
- Your body is rejecting
your new heart.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.207
- And once they realized there
was nothing more they could do,

01:17.251 --> 01:19.514
they transferred you here.

01:19.557 --> 01:22.734
- Why would they...
do that?

01:22.778 --> 01:25.085
- To keep their
mortality rates low.

01:26.608 --> 01:29.611
- So...

01:29.654 --> 01:33.484
they sent me...
here to die?

01:39.447 --> 01:40.752
- Karen Brantley,
can I borrow you for a second?

01:40.796 --> 01:42.667
- Ah, Max, so glad
you could join us.

01:42.711 --> 01:45.235
- Mm-hmm.
- We said 8:30 sharp.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.454
I would've reminded
your assistant,

01:46.497 --> 01:47.455
but you still
don't have one.

01:47.498 --> 01:49.413
- It's on my to-do list.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.720
- Ozzie, this is our hospital's
very busy Medical Director...

01:51.763 --> 01:53.243
- Hi.
- Max Goodwin.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.462
- Pleasure.

01:54.505 --> 01:57.117
- Ozzie Cobb has pledged
$5 million...

01:57.160 --> 01:58.509
- 5.
- Over the next quarter.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.685
- Wow.
- What can I say?

02:00.729 --> 02:02.426
I love to give.
- Thank you.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.472
Would you excuse us?
This way--just come with me.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.517
- You do realize

02:06.561 --> 02:08.606
I'm trying
to fund your hospital here.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.913
- Yeah, well, University
just dumped a patient

02:10.956 --> 02:13.263
on our doorstep--
days, if not hours,

02:13.307 --> 02:14.656
before she's expected to die.
All right?

02:14.699 --> 02:16.266
You wanna know why?
Because they're cooking

02:16.310 --> 02:17.485
their books, all right?

02:17.528 --> 02:19.182
She's not gonna die
on their watch,

02:19.226 --> 02:21.184
she's gonna die on ours,
and she is not the only one.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.707
There have been others.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.448
- Of course there's
been others, Max.

02:24.492 --> 02:27.190
Every hospital dumps patients.
Even New Amsterdam.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.759
Hello!
Sorry about that.

02:36.286 --> 02:37.896
- Yes, I'm listening,
Gladys, obviously.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.550
It's Saleem, he's on the piano.
Just--

02:39.594 --> 02:42.292
- Dad, you're supposed
to be listening to me.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.815
- You know what? Wait--
Oh, okay, okay.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.383
No, if he's already 51/50,
then no, no can do.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.819
That is a big no no.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.386
- Dad!
- Yes, honey,

02:49.430 --> 02:51.910
you sound amazing.
Keep going, all right?

02:51.954 --> 02:53.477
No, that's what I'm saying.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.436
Saleem, babe, hey!

02:55.479 --> 02:57.916
Yeah, let's try a little
sotto voce, all right?

02:57.960 --> 03:00.876
It is a headache
and it's a compliance issue.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.834
- Namaste, Ella-ji.
- Good morning.

03:02.878 --> 03:06.316
- I was wondering
if you would ever wake up.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.797
- Oh.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.930
This is a lot of stuff.

03:11.974 --> 03:14.237
I just--I need just cornflakes.

03:14.281 --> 03:17.719
- No, no, no boxed cereal.
Not in this house.

03:17.762 --> 03:23.725
Only fresh, healthy food
for you and the baby.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.252
Stuffed parathas,

03:29.296 --> 03:31.907
a little bit of curd.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.953
A little more.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.391
Yes.

03:39.393 --> 03:40.437
- Mmm.

03:41.830 --> 03:44.659
- You came home
rather late last night.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.662
- It was 9:00.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.839
- 9:07, give or take.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.667
- You don't have
to wait up for me.

03:52.710 --> 03:56.671
- Or if you came home earlier,
I wouldn't have to.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.849
Now, about the dirty dishes.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.416
- I have to go to work.
- Already?

04:02.459 --> 04:04.548
- Yeah, sorry.
- Okay.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.334
Ella, wait a minute.

04:07.377 --> 04:10.293
Don't forget this.
- What's in here?

04:10.337 --> 04:12.687
- Your lunch.
Freshly made Indian food.

04:12.730 --> 04:16.473
Wait until you try
my special samosas.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.345
- Thank you.

04:18.388 --> 04:19.911
- Namaste, Ella-ji.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.609
- Dr. Duarte.

04:21.652 --> 04:22.914
I didn't expect to hear
from you so soon.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.612
How's San Francisco?

04:24.655 --> 04:26.614
- You'll be finding out
soon enough, Floyd.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.746
We'd like to officially
offer you the position

04:28.790 --> 04:31.401
as new Chair
of Cardiothoracic Surgery

04:31.445 --> 04:33.621
at Yerba Buena Hospital.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.318
- That's...

04:35.362 --> 04:38.060
- Great news, I hope.
- Uh, yeah, I, uh--

04:38.103 --> 04:40.497
It is.
Uh, but before I say yes,

04:40.541 --> 04:42.020
I'd like to square
some things up here.

04:42.064 --> 04:44.414
Can I have a few days?
- Sure. A few days.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.808
We'll talk soon.

04:48.462 --> 04:49.767
- Max!
- Did you know that

04:49.811 --> 04:51.639
New Amsterdam has
dumped over 30 patients

04:51.682 --> 04:54.294
into the municipal hospice
system in the last six months?

04:54.337 --> 04:56.426
- Wow, that's a lot.
- 30 within six months.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.993
That's not just a lot.
It's appalling.

04:58.036 --> 05:00.082
- Completely agree.
That's absolutely horrific.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.084
But I'm gonna need you to
switch gears for just a minute.

05:02.127 --> 05:03.955
- Yeah, how can I help?
- I need you to not approve

05:03.999 --> 05:05.479
my brachytherapy device.

05:05.522 --> 05:06.828
- How can I not help?

05:06.871 --> 05:08.090
- Exactly.
- Why would I do that?

05:08.133 --> 05:09.787
- Because Castro
didn't approve it.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.528
The request never should've
gotten up to you.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.356
- I seem to remember having
very candid conversation

05:13.400 --> 05:14.836
about me having your back.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.446
- You can have my back,
but this just looks like

05:16.490 --> 05:17.795
I went over Castro's head.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.362
- Is it going to help
out patients?

05:19.406 --> 05:20.450
- I mean, yes.
- Is it within budget?

05:20.494 --> 05:21.712
- Yes--
- Will it make

05:21.756 --> 05:23.105
our hospital better?
- Of course.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.802
But in order to keep the peace

05:24.846 --> 05:27.370
between Castro and myself,
I can't have you...

05:27.414 --> 05:28.632
favoring me.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.591
- I do favor you.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.463
- All right, well,
keep that to yourself.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.683
- Just tell Castro that
I'm favoring our patients.

05:35.726 --> 05:36.727
- Max, no--
- And if she has

05:36.771 --> 05:38.033
a problem with that,

05:38.076 --> 05:39.426
just tell her
to come talk to me.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.036
- Where are you going?

05:44.692 --> 05:47.651
- Thank you for choosing
Bell Gardens Hospice.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.436
- Excuse me, hi.
- Visiting's not for

05:49.479 --> 05:51.786
another 30 minutes.
- No, I'm not visiting.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.091
- Oh, okay.
Intake's down the hall.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.660
- I'm not here
to drop off either.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.836
I'm actually--excuse me--
here to pick up.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.142
- I--I'm sorry, what?

06:00.185 --> 06:02.013
- Uh, well, I'm sorry because

06:02.057 --> 06:04.364
you've gotten some of New
Amsterdam's patients by mistake

06:04.407 --> 06:06.540
and I'm here to take them back.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.499
- W-Which patients?

06:13.024 --> 06:15.157
- All of them.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.165
- New Amsterdam has been
failing our patients

06:23.208 --> 06:24.471
at the end of their lives.

06:24.514 --> 06:25.515
We care for them right up until

06:25.559 --> 06:26.864
their last days and then,

06:26.908 --> 06:28.126
when curing them
is no longer an option,

06:28.170 --> 06:29.780
we pass the buck.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.521
We turn them loose on
overburdened systems--

06:31.565 --> 06:33.697
hospice, nursing homes,
unprepared families.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.960
This is not what End-of-Life
care should look like.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.398
So we're gonna
change that today.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.834
Welcome--excuse me--

06:39.877 --> 06:43.011
to the New Amsterdam
Palliative Care Unit.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.841
- In my hallway?

06:46.884 --> 06:48.190
- Working on that.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.192
Every doctor is gonna
get a patient

06:50.235 --> 06:52.063
and they'll be with you
till the end.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.935
- What about our
actual patients?

06:53.978 --> 06:55.980
- Just rely on your residents
and your attendings for now.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.635
I want your full attention
here today.

06:58.679 --> 07:01.116
- But if they're palliative,
what medicine are we offering?

07:01.159 --> 07:03.727
- No medicine.
This is about, uh, care, okay?

07:03.771 --> 07:05.468
I want you to talk to them,

07:05.512 --> 07:07.427
figure out what they need
and make sure they get it.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.516
- What about cost?
Who is covering this? Are we?

07:09.559 --> 07:10.995
- I don't know,
but I'm gonna figure that out.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.519
This is for you.
Yup.

07:12.562 --> 07:15.652
- So we--we can do anything?

07:15.696 --> 07:18.612
- Anything. Just give them
a good death.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.527
All right?

07:29.057 --> 07:30.754
-  Peter.

07:31.973 --> 07:34.454
Peter, hi.
Hi.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.107
I'm Dr. Frome.

07:36.151 --> 07:39.502
I'm, uh, Ignatius,
or Iggy.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.808
Dr. Iggy.
Driggy.

07:40.851 --> 07:43.767
Any combination
of that will do.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.769
I'm here to take
care of you, okay?

07:46.988 --> 07:50.513
- I'm Dr. Kapoor, and I'll
be taking care of you today.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.777
I see you have had Scleroderma
for several years,

07:53.821 --> 07:56.867
but two months ago it started
causing organ failure.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.870
- Yes. I'll be dead
in a few days.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.005
- Dr. Meredith?

08:04.048 --> 08:05.528
- Zeke's fine.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.095
- I'm Dr. Sharpe.

08:07.138 --> 08:09.140
What can I do to make you
more comfortable?

08:09.184 --> 08:11.969
- More comfortable?
I'm dying.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.671
- Adele Eisenbaum?

08:17.714 --> 08:21.196
Um, I'm Max and, uh, I'm here
to make you comfortable.

08:21.239 --> 08:24.634
- I'd lower your expectations.

08:24.678 --> 08:25.853
- Okay.

08:25.896 --> 08:28.508
- I do have a wonderful idea.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.292
We will give you
a living wake.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.989
- A wake?

08:32.033 --> 08:34.078
- To allow your family
and relatives

08:34.122 --> 08:36.037
to gather and celebrate
your life

08:36.080 --> 08:39.214
while you're still there
to celebrate it with them.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.607
- Nope.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.218
- "Nope"?

08:43.261 --> 08:46.743
- I'll have a living wake
over my dead body.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.661
- My mother has been
a patient at University

08:51.705 --> 08:53.794
for over a decade.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.273
I was gonna have my baby there.

08:55.317 --> 08:58.059
And they just threw her out,
like, like--

08:58.102 --> 09:00.104
You have to do something.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.150
You have to save her.

09:02.193 --> 09:05.066
- No, no, Mrs. Shipley,
I can't do that, all right?

09:05.109 --> 09:06.284
No one can do that.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.810
- Late stage leukemia

09:09.853 --> 09:11.725
comes with a host
of physical ailments

09:11.768 --> 09:16.643
that can make the transitioning
process...challenging.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.080
- And where exactly
am I transitioning to,

09:19.123 --> 09:22.692
would you say?

09:22.736 --> 09:24.912
- Well,
I suppose that depends.

09:26.217 --> 09:29.133
What do you believe in?

09:29.177 --> 09:30.787
- Numbers.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.224
- Oh, so your doctorate
is in mathematics?

09:33.268 --> 09:35.966
- I was a professor
for 25 years.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.925
- What drew you to math?

09:39.796 --> 09:42.712
- The certainty.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.714
But this...

09:44.758 --> 09:49.893
what I'm facing now is...
incomprehensible.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.939
It's unknowable.

09:51.982 --> 09:55.856
- I guess death can't
be solved like an equation.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.815
- And yet,
death is a certainty.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.777
You really wanna help me?

10:03.820 --> 10:05.779
Solve that.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.916
- I...

10:12.960 --> 10:15.266
- It's okay.
What--what is it?

10:15.310 --> 10:16.964
- I...

10:18.792 --> 10:20.750
I want to see my father.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.230
- Your father?
Okay.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.711
- Yeah.
- Okay, I can do that.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.060
I can arrange that.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.236
Is he in the city?

10:28.279 --> 10:30.368
- Don't know.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.849
Haven't spoken...

10:32.893 --> 10:37.027
Haven't spoken...
in 12 years.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.334
- Okay.

10:39.377 --> 10:42.380
- There's no excuse
for what happened, all right?

10:42.424 --> 10:44.644
But your mother's here now,
and we're gonna do our best

10:44.687 --> 10:47.081
to make sure
she's comfortable, okay?

10:47.124 --> 10:49.431
- You need to do more than make
sure she's comfortable.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.172
You need to make sure
she's better.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.695
- Mrs. Shipley--

10:52.739 --> 10:55.089
- You're just as bad
as University.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.786
You're just giving up on her.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.788
What is this place for
if you can't save--

11:00.921 --> 11:02.313
- Whoa, whoa, oh--

11:02.357 --> 11:04.794
Uh, Bloom,
little help here, please.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.666
- Regina?
- Her water broke.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.015
- Is it too soon?

11:08.058 --> 11:09.843
I'm only 34 weeks.
- No, no, no, it's okay.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.453
You're in a safe window.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.847
This is, uh, your preterm,
okay?

11:13.890 --> 11:15.326
- I'm gonna be fine, Mom.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.327
- I was actually hoping
I'd get to deliver

11:16.371 --> 11:18.765
a baby today.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.988
- Am I...
really going to see

11:25.032 --> 11:27.338
my grandchild?

11:33.388 --> 11:36.043
- Stage 4 Adenocarcinoma.

11:36.086 --> 11:39.263
- Guess they were right
about the smoking.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.701
They're giving me four
to six weeks.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.964
- Mmm.
And what did you do before...

11:44.007 --> 11:47.271
- Dying?
Worked for the city council

11:47.315 --> 11:48.925
in Yonkers.

11:48.969 --> 11:52.842
I'd field all the angry calls.

11:52.886 --> 11:55.062
Your sidewalk's got a crack?

11:55.105 --> 11:59.370
Old power lines are drooping
into your marigolds?

11:59.414 --> 12:01.851
I was the soothing voice

12:01.895 --> 12:03.723
on the other end of the line.
- Max!

12:03.766 --> 12:05.507
I need help with
a very important donor...

12:05.550 --> 12:07.248
- You're hired.
- For what?

12:07.291 --> 12:08.858
- And you flood our halls

12:08.902 --> 12:09.946
with patients
we've already discharged?

12:09.990 --> 12:11.513
- Karen, I'm glad you're here.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.993
I'd like you to meet my
new executive assistant,

12:13.036 --> 12:15.517
Adele Eisenbaum.
Highly, highly skilled

12:15.560 --> 12:18.215
and tons of experience.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.478
- I'm happy to come aboard.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.872
- Great. Now, come back
upstairs with me

12:22.916 --> 12:24.787
while I've still got
Ozzie on the hook.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.267
- You know what,
I would love to, but I, um...

12:26.310 --> 12:29.836
- Um, oh, unfortunately,

12:29.879 --> 12:34.884
Dr. Goodwin's schedule
is a little crammed.

12:34.928 --> 12:37.408
Uh, he has to get
everyone settled

12:37.452 --> 12:40.107
before people start
dying in the hallways.

12:40.150 --> 12:43.240
I like those nails,
by the way.

12:43.284 --> 12:47.810
But as soon as Dr. Goodwin
sorts through this mess

12:47.854 --> 12:50.247
you're gonna hear from him.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.423
- I like her.
I hope you stick around.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.816
- I'm temporary.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.296
- We'll see about that.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.863
Now find a better place
for these patients.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.299
- Yup, working on it, boss.

13:01.519 --> 13:05.436
- Maybe with a new coat
of paint, hmm?

13:05.480 --> 13:08.091
- Don't make me quit
before I die.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.964
- Now, this could work.

13:11.007 --> 13:14.184
Watch out, okay, good, okay,
one second--okay, we're going.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.147
- No.
- Yeah, no.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.888
Mm. Here we are.

13:23.628 --> 13:26.980
This floor hasn't been used
in, uh, years.

13:27.023 --> 13:30.157
Ooh, sorry, watch out for...
whatever that is.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.855
Uh, I don't even know
what's in that room.

13:32.899 --> 13:36.293
Uh, when equipment breaks
down or loses its function,

13:36.337 --> 13:38.034
it ends up here.

13:39.906 --> 13:43.866
We even started calling it
"The Graveyard."

13:43.910 --> 13:45.955
- Oh, my God.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.522
- I know.
It's perfect.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.659
- Welcome to
"The Graveyard."

13:54.703 --> 13:56.487
We're gonna change the name.

13:56.531 --> 13:59.403
Uh, this will be the home
of our new palliative wing.

13:59.447 --> 14:02.406
It's gonna be
a place to call your own.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.365
You know, your own--
your own rooms.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.149
Your own spaces.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.195
So just check it out
and find a, uh, spot

14:08.238 --> 14:10.110
that feels right for you,
wherever you like.

14:10.153 --> 14:13.635
Wherever calls your name,
just...

14:13.678 --> 14:16.333
So...what do you think?

14:18.553 --> 14:21.338
- I think it looks like
a hospital.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.079
- Not a ringing
endorsement, but--

14:23.123 --> 14:24.602
- We didn't pull our punches

14:24.646 --> 14:26.561
at the Yonkers City
Council meetings.

14:26.604 --> 14:30.304
- All right, well, I'm just
looking for a comfortable place

14:30.347 --> 14:31.609
for people to...

14:31.653 --> 14:34.264
- Kick the bucket?

14:34.308 --> 14:35.613
- Yeah.

14:35.657 --> 14:39.008
- Nobody here
wants to die, Max.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.619
When you know your time left

14:41.663 --> 14:45.058
on this big blue ball
is short,

14:45.101 --> 14:47.974
you look at things
a little differently.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.152
- I can relate, actually.

14:52.195 --> 14:55.372
- Well, then, look around.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.419
We don't want a place to die.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.290
We want a place to live.

15:00.334 --> 15:04.294
And who in the hell wants
to live in a hospital?

15:09.473 --> 15:11.475
- Oh, uh, Iggy--
- Hi.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.390
- Hi.
Could we swap patients?

15:13.434 --> 15:16.045
- Oh, no way, no.
I'm way too invested in my guy.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.395
He's a black-sheep son
trying to reconnect

15:18.439 --> 15:20.223
with his emotionally
unavailable father,

15:20.267 --> 15:22.660
which in no way whatsoever
reminds me of my own family.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.967
Why, what's yours?
- Mine asked me to solve

15:25.011 --> 15:26.142
the meaning of the universe.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.578
- Oof. Whoa.
- Right?

15:27.622 --> 15:29.493
How exactly is one
supposed to do that?

15:29.537 --> 15:31.191
- Well, you know,

15:31.234 --> 15:32.670
psilocybin has actually
shown some real promise

15:32.714 --> 15:34.672
in helping people with
existential crisis.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.326
AKA dying.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.980
- You want me to give him
hallucinogenic mushrooms?

15:38.024 --> 15:39.460
- Well, if you get
"Right to Try" approval,

15:39.503 --> 15:42.376
it's perfectly legal.
Unlike, say, heroin.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.508
- Shut up.
- Okay.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.554
- And thank you,
I will consider it.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.295
- You're welcome.
- Iggy,

15:48.338 --> 15:50.775
you must swap patients with me.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.429
- What is happening
around here? No.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.257
No tradesies.
- This Debra Keating

15:54.301 --> 15:56.520
is an unreasonable woman.
I told her I wanted to give her

15:56.564 --> 15:58.696
a beautiful wake.
You know what she said?

15:58.740 --> 16:00.829
- No.
- That's right. "No."

16:00.872 --> 16:04.354
- You know, I wanted to give
a living wake for my wife.

16:04.398 --> 16:08.358
But Debra is refusing,
and I don't know why.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.708
- Well, did you ask her?

16:10.752 --> 16:12.362
- No.
- You know, a wise man

16:12.406 --> 16:14.451
about your height once
told me that listening

16:14.495 --> 16:16.018
is a very effective tool
in determining

16:16.062 --> 16:18.542
why people think the things
that they think.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.327
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.
One second.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.024
Where did you get this from?

16:22.068 --> 16:23.634
- Oh, there's a veritable feast
right there.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.767
But don't worry,
it's not as good as yours.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.688
- Psilocybin is being used in
in End-of-Life study protocols

16:33.731 --> 16:36.082
all over the country.
- And I do not feel comfortable

16:36.125 --> 16:37.561
clearing it for use
in my department.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.520
- "Right to Try" laws
allow wide latitude

16:39.563 --> 16:42.218
in treating terminal patients.
If you just met Zeke--

16:42.262 --> 16:44.090
- I'm not adding any more
fuel to this whole

16:44.133 --> 16:45.395
"Heroin Den Helen" thing

16:45.439 --> 16:47.310
by letting you
prescribe "shrooms."

16:47.354 --> 16:49.573
- It's micro-dosing. and
it will be carefully monitored.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.227
- It's not gonna happen.

16:51.271 --> 16:54.361
But feel free to go over
my head and run to Max,

16:54.404 --> 16:57.712
because that is how
this works, right?

17:06.547 --> 17:09.463
- Forgive me, Debra.

17:09.506 --> 17:13.423
You are in charge of how
the next few days should go,

17:13.467 --> 17:16.905
and I am here just to listen.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.602
- Thank you.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.653
- Okay,

17:25.696 --> 17:30.527
I'm listening,
but I'm not hearing anything.

17:32.529 --> 17:33.791
- What is there to say?

17:33.835 --> 17:35.793
- Oh--so much.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.273
N-not just for you,

17:37.317 --> 17:39.275
but for your friends
and relatives.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.886
Oh, sorry, I'm just
here to listen. Sorry.

17:45.847 --> 17:48.458
- I haven't seen anyone
since things got bad.

17:48.502 --> 17:51.505
I just want to be alone.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.681
I even gave away Beverly.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.336
- Beverly?

17:56.379 --> 17:59.208
- My cocker spaniel.

17:59.252 --> 18:03.430
- So why would you
wish to do this alone?

18:05.780 --> 18:08.304
- I don't want to
share this with anyone.

18:10.350 --> 18:13.440
I've kept my feelings
to myself my whole life.

18:15.311 --> 18:18.358
Why should my death
be any different?

18:21.883 --> 18:25.452
It would just upset people
if they saw me like this.

18:25.495 --> 18:30.326
- So you don't want
to have a living wake

18:30.370 --> 18:35.331
because you're trying
to protect other people?

18:35.375 --> 18:37.377
- Yes.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.206
- I understand now, Debra.

18:40.249 --> 18:43.557
I know exactly what you need.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.908
A living wake.
- What?

18:46.951 --> 18:50.520
No, I don't want it.
- I'm listening to your words,

18:50.564 --> 18:52.435
and I'm hearing you
loud and clear.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.568
- No, I said I don't want...

18:54.611 --> 18:56.265
- Debra, you're going
to love it.

18:56.309 --> 18:59.312
- ...a living wake.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.234
- Thank you.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.893
Peter.

19:15.937 --> 19:19.288
Peter, your dad
is here to see you.

19:43.530 --> 19:44.922
- Hi.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.757
I--I hate you.

19:55.977 --> 19:58.762
I've always hated you.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.607
- There we go.
- Oh, what happened?

20:17.651 --> 20:20.610
- Someone had a little slip
and fall up on L and D.

20:20.654 --> 20:23.004
- I got a little excited.

20:23.047 --> 20:27.008
Thought I could...
stand at Regina's bedside.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.096
- Let me take a look.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.360
Ooh, yeah,
that's a real humdinger.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.014
Probably best if I put
in a couple stitches.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.668
- I'm fine.
- Well, just to be safe.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.540
- I wanna get back upstairs.

20:37.584 --> 20:40.500
I don't wanna miss
my grandbaby.

20:40.543 --> 20:41.979
- It's only gonna
take a minute.

20:42.023 --> 20:46.419
- Dr. Bloom, I'm at
a time in my life where

20:46.462 --> 20:49.596
every minute...matters.

20:49.639 --> 20:52.425
- Okay, look, at least
let me thrown on some bandages

20:52.468 --> 20:54.035
for the road, okay?

20:57.952 --> 21:00.346
- I always dreamt

21:00.389 --> 21:02.086
of being a grandmother...

21:05.612 --> 21:09.398
Spoiling my grandkids
with love.

21:10.573 --> 21:15.012
I really thought...
I would have more time.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.671
- Marianne?

21:21.715 --> 21:24.108
M-Marianne?
- W-Whoa, okay, okay.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.023
Get her legs.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.547
- Okay.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.116
- No pulse.
- Cardiac arrest.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.031
Grab the defibrillator.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.729
What are you doing?

21:35.772 --> 21:37.383
- She's DNR.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.689
- You--you cannot be serious.
- Oh, no, no, no.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.561
We gotta let her go.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.606
- In two seconds I can
have her breathing again.

21:43.650 --> 21:46.522
- Lauren, she made
her wishes clear.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.655
- She wishes to see
her grandchild!

21:48.698 --> 21:51.005
- But that was a minute ago
in a conversation.

21:51.048 --> 21:53.050
The legal and binding
choice she made

21:53.094 --> 21:54.922
was no shocks,
no medical intervention.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.489
Look, it's here
in her file.

21:56.532 --> 21:57.881
- Okay, but if she
was awake right now,

21:57.925 --> 21:59.709
she would reverse that DNR,
and you know it.

21:59.753 --> 22:02.103
- But she's not awake.
- That's because we're arguing

22:02.146 --> 22:03.496
instead of trying
to resuscitate her!

22:03.539 --> 22:04.540
- Lauren, if you
touch Marianne,

22:04.584 --> 22:05.846
you're violating her rights.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.630
You need to
let her go in peace.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.153
Here, no, she's DNR.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.902
Lauren!
What are you doing?

22:18.946 --> 22:21.035
- Someone get the crash cart
in here now!

22:21.078 --> 22:23.211
- Stop!

22:23.254 --> 22:25.387
- I need MP.
Come on, Marianne.

22:42.839 --> 22:45.581
- Enjoy the trip, Doc.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.584
- If Dr. Sharpe thinks
this will help,

22:48.628 --> 22:52.022
she's worse off than I am.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.812
- This stays between us.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.292
And thank you.
- For what?

23:01.336 --> 23:03.860
I wasn't even here.

23:03.904 --> 23:07.081
Oh, you gotta get me back
before Burning Man.

23:10.519 --> 23:12.782
- Uh, hey, everyone.
Sorry to interrupt.

23:12.826 --> 23:15.002
Um, it was recently
brought to my attention

23:15.045 --> 23:16.960
that this feels
like a hospital.

23:17.004 --> 23:20.616
So I'd like you to meet our new
therapists and social workers,

23:20.660 --> 23:22.966
all of whom are fully trained
in palliative care.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.708
I've also hired some
acupuncturists

23:25.752 --> 23:28.494
and a yoga instructor,
massage therapist,

23:28.537 --> 23:30.931
and last but not least,
I would like you to meet

23:30.974 --> 23:32.715
Trinket and Cici!
- Aww.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.543
- Hey, hi there!

23:34.587 --> 23:36.197
- Uh, these guys are gonna
hang out with you

23:36.240 --> 23:37.938
and have some fun,
so without further ado,

23:37.981 --> 23:39.853
I'd like you to welcome
the new full-time staff

23:39.896 --> 23:41.202
of "The Graveyard."

23:41.245 --> 23:43.639
And we've really gotta
change that name.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.859
- I am impressed.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.643
- Not bad, right?

23:47.687 --> 23:50.254
- But like we used to say
at the Yonkers City Council,

23:50.298 --> 23:53.867
how the hell are we
paying for this?

23:53.910 --> 23:55.564
- I'm working on it.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.785
- So how did you like the lunch
I prepared for you?

23:58.828 --> 24:00.830
- It was so good.
I loved it, thank you.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.529
- And what was your
favorite part?

24:03.572 --> 24:06.880
Mutton samosa?
- Yup, yes, definitely.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.664
- They were vegetable samosas.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.666
How could you give
away the food

24:10.710 --> 24:13.234
that I just made for you?

24:13.277 --> 24:14.888
- It's too much.

24:14.931 --> 24:17.194
- Okay, I will pack
a smaller lunch.

24:17.238 --> 24:18.979
- No,
that's not what I meant.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.937
I mean,
I know I asked for help,

24:20.981 --> 24:22.896
but you're smothering me.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.637
- I was just trying
to help you.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.986
- I know, and I'm sorry,

24:26.029 --> 24:27.988
but I don't need
to be helped like that.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.685
You're stressing me out.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.948
- This is what family does.

24:31.992 --> 24:32.993
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.342
I just--if this is gonna work,

24:34.385 --> 24:36.605
I just need us to have
some boundaries.

24:37.998 --> 24:40.827
- Boundaries?

24:40.870 --> 24:42.568
What kind of boundaries?

24:42.611 --> 24:44.918
- Just for starters,
you can't feed me five courses

24:44.961 --> 24:46.702
at every meal.
I know that might be how

24:46.746 --> 24:48.574
you do things, but it's
not how I want to do them.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.880
I wanna eat what I wanna eat.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.188
- Okay.

24:54.231 --> 24:55.624
Well...

24:57.365 --> 24:59.628
If this is what you feel.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.764
I'll see you at home.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.853
- Don't wait up.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.898
Welcome to Pain De Vie.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.820
- Oh...hey.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.213
- Hey.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.695
- How are you
holding up?

25:22.738 --> 25:25.045
- Still can't get his words
out of my head.

25:25.088 --> 25:27.743
Don't think I ever will.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.049
- Yeah.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.836
You know, I, um...

25:37.753 --> 25:41.235
I've said those words
to my father.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.197
I've hated my father.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.027
I've hated him.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.990
But I never stopped
loving him.

25:57.033 --> 25:58.905
Ever.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.345
And I care what he thinks
about me.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.260
I really do.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.088
Just like how Peter cared
what you thought about him.

26:08.131 --> 26:10.090
- Okay, I appreciate what
you're trying to do here,

26:10.133 --> 26:12.092
but I was never there for him.

26:12.135 --> 26:14.703
- He asked for you.

26:16.487 --> 26:21.188
That was his dying wish
was to see you.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.494
And yes, it was ugly,

26:23.538 --> 26:25.496
and it was rough.

26:25.540 --> 26:30.676
But...I promise you,
it was not just hate.

26:30.719 --> 26:35.028
- Well, doesn't matter now.
It's over.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.246
- No, no, no.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.771
But for Peter, it is, yes.

26:38.814 --> 26:41.687
But not for you.

26:41.730 --> 26:44.254
You get to finish
the conversation.

26:53.089 --> 26:55.439
- I don't think
this is working.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.444
- I've heard death

27:00.488 --> 27:06.320
described as the introduction
of ink into water.

27:06.363 --> 27:10.150
So it's not a vanishing,

27:10.193 --> 27:13.980
it's an expansion.

27:14.023 --> 27:19.072
- A poetic treatment
won't solve a concrete problem.

27:19.115 --> 27:21.944
- I relate as a scientist,
I do.

27:21.988 --> 27:25.774
But to me,

27:25.818 --> 27:29.212
numbers aren't concrete
at all.

27:29.256 --> 27:31.301
And neither is death.

27:34.609 --> 27:37.917
- Make your case, doctor.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.227
- What's the highest number?

27:44.271 --> 27:47.970
Or the last digit in pi?

27:48.014 --> 27:52.105
How many snowflakes
are in a blizzard?

27:52.148 --> 27:55.108
When it comes
to the end of life,

27:55.151 --> 27:57.284
maybe we need to leave
quantifiable behind

27:57.327 --> 28:02.202
and rely instead on experience.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.160
After all, no one can count
all the snowflakes

28:04.204 --> 28:06.902
in a winter storm.

28:15.258 --> 28:18.392
- Nothing...

28:18.435 --> 28:22.352
is actually
very easy to count.

28:41.110 --> 28:43.634
- She's stable.
Heart rate and rhythm normal.

28:43.678 --> 28:47.247
Blood pressure steady.
Mentally intact.

28:52.687 --> 28:56.082
Are you--
are you punishing me?

28:56.125 --> 28:57.866
For saving her life?

28:57.910 --> 28:59.520
- The ends don't
justify the means.

28:59.563 --> 29:02.436
- Marianne is gonna get to see
her grandchild before she dies.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.177
- Once you started to
resuscitate her,

29:04.220 --> 29:06.353
when were you going to stop?
At three broken ribs?

29:06.396 --> 29:07.571
At a chest tube?

29:07.615 --> 29:09.138
What if you had revived
Marianne

29:09.182 --> 29:12.054
only to learn that
she was brain dead?

29:12.098 --> 29:13.664
- Yeah, well,
none of that happened.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.362
- Yeah, but our job
was to give her a good death.

29:15.405 --> 29:16.929
She had it and you just
took it away.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.191
- I did what Max
would have wanted.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.366
- Oh, you're gonna
pin it on Max?

29:19.409 --> 29:21.107
- Not just Max.
You know,

29:21.150 --> 29:22.935
Sharpe, Iggy, Kapoor--

29:22.978 --> 29:24.588
all of them would've
done the exact same thing.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.373
- Oh, you don't know that.
- Take a look around, Floyd.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.505
Everyone here
bends the rules.

29:28.549 --> 29:30.072
Everyone except you.

29:30.116 --> 29:32.118
So you wanna find
someone to shame,

29:32.161 --> 29:34.076
someone who doesn't
fit in here,

29:34.120 --> 29:36.165
you're looking at
the wrong person.

29:40.604 --> 29:43.694
- Uh, thank you all for coming
to Debra's living wake.

29:43.738 --> 29:47.133
If you have things
you wish to say to her,

29:47.176 --> 29:52.051
feelings you wish her to know,

29:52.094 --> 29:54.314
now is the time.

29:57.621 --> 30:00.102
Why--why don't you start
us off, Debra?

30:00.146 --> 30:03.366
Um, tell everyone
what you're feeling.

30:06.587 --> 30:09.024
- I can't do this.

30:09.068 --> 30:12.071
- Yes, you can.
Just open up.

30:12.114 --> 30:15.291
Ladies and gentlemen,
Debra Keating.

30:30.306 --> 30:31.438
Beverly?

30:33.483 --> 30:34.745
- Come here, girl.

30:34.789 --> 30:38.314
Come here.
All right.

30:39.489 --> 30:42.405
Most of you know my Beverly.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.281
What you don't know

30:48.324 --> 30:50.761
is that when
my health plummeted,

30:50.805 --> 30:52.720
she was so worried about me

30:52.763 --> 30:55.418
she wouldn't even
touch her food.

30:55.462 --> 30:59.074
She became so sad
and lethargic.

30:59.118 --> 31:04.732
So she really experienced
the illness with me.

31:04.775 --> 31:07.343
So even though
it broke my heart,

31:07.387 --> 31:10.520
I gave her to my sister, Anna.

31:10.564 --> 31:13.262
My rock since
the day I was born.

31:15.699 --> 31:19.747
And Frank,
the best brother-in-law.

31:19.790 --> 31:22.750
I love you
and your whole family.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.273
Is Ted here?

31:24.317 --> 31:28.321
There you are.
Thank you for being here.

31:28.364 --> 31:33.239
And, uh, Jeremy.

31:33.282 --> 31:36.155
I--I never thought
I'd say this out loud...

31:36.198 --> 31:40.072
- Debra--
- But I--I have loved you

31:40.115 --> 31:42.639
ever since that
night at the ferry.

31:42.683 --> 31:45.555
I didn't know how to say it.
- Stop, stop speaking.

31:45.599 --> 31:48.602
Stop speaking, please.
This wake is over.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.038
Please, thank you,
and good-bye.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.692
Please, thank you,
bye-bye. Bye.

31:51.735 --> 31:54.477
- What are you doing?
- You--you can't have a wake.

31:54.521 --> 31:58.481
You're not dying, so...

31:58.525 --> 32:00.048
- Tell me you kept
the receipts.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.832
- Okay, before you
say anything else,

32:01.876 --> 32:05.271
uh, you should know that,
uh, it looks expensive,

32:05.314 --> 32:08.317
and that's because it is.
But it's the right thing to do,

32:08.361 --> 32:10.493
and it's all paid for.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.408
- And how, pray tell,
is that even possible?

32:12.452 --> 32:14.367
- Because of you.

32:14.410 --> 32:17.370
All your hard work with
the new donor, Ozzie Cobb.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.633
$5 million donation, wow.

32:19.676 --> 32:21.809
And all I need for this
is $1 million.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.551
You, Karen Brantley,
are a genius.

32:24.594 --> 32:27.075
- Ozzie Cobb hasn't given
a dime to this hospital.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.251
- What's that now?
- He's a selfish tight-ass

32:29.295 --> 32:33.386
who pledges millions every year
and never donates a damn thing.

32:33.429 --> 32:35.257
I was hoping to get him
on the hook.

32:35.301 --> 32:36.737
But he wriggled out again.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.739
And if you just had shown up,

32:38.782 --> 32:40.741
you might've been able to reel
him back in, but you didn't.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.222
And now it's too late.

32:43.265 --> 32:46.181
- Okay. If I'd known that--
- Save it, Max.

32:46.225 --> 32:49.489
Because you just spent
$1 million we don't have.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.578
- Um...
- Get everyone out of here

32:51.621 --> 32:52.709
today.

33:03.851 --> 33:06.245
- I'm not going to die?

33:06.288 --> 33:08.682
- Nope.
You and Beverly both have

33:08.725 --> 33:11.685
a bacterial disease
called Leptospirosis.

33:11.728 --> 33:14.166
It presents the same
in humans and canines.

33:14.209 --> 33:17.256
Uh, you must have gotten it
on one of your walks.

33:17.299 --> 33:19.736
- But how did no one--
- The symptoms were masked

33:19.780 --> 33:21.825
by your Scleroderma.
It was well hidden.

33:21.869 --> 33:25.264
- Then how did you know?

33:25.307 --> 33:27.831
- I listened to you.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.355
With antibiotics,

33:29.398 --> 33:34.403
both of you will make
a full recovery.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.188
- Oh.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.847
Once you start
with the emotions,

33:43.891 --> 33:46.459
it's hard to stop,
isn't it?

33:49.940 --> 33:52.421
Oh, my God.

33:52.465 --> 33:55.468
I told all those people
how I feel.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.689
Even Jeremy.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.477
- I realize now that
a living wake

34:04.520 --> 34:06.740
may not have been
what you needed.

34:06.783 --> 34:10.439
I'm really sorry for
forcing you to have one.

34:10.483 --> 34:14.356
- Don't you dare be sorry.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.358
My wake...

34:20.493 --> 34:24.366
It was the best day
of my life.

34:48.608 --> 34:50.784
- Peter.

35:05.451 --> 35:08.497
You are my baby boy.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.808
I wish...

35:14.851 --> 35:18.551
I wish I could've
shown you how much...

35:18.594 --> 35:21.641
how much I love you.

35:26.080 --> 35:30.737
But Papa's here now.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.740
I'm here.

35:33.783 --> 35:36.395
And I'm not leaving.

35:45.317 --> 35:47.406
- Ozzie, I am so glad
I caught you.

35:47.449 --> 35:48.929
You are one slippery fish.

35:48.972 --> 35:50.322
Well, I told chairwoman
Bradley

35:50.365 --> 35:51.801
I've see everything
I needed to see.

35:51.845 --> 35:53.760
- Yeah, actually,
not everything.

35:53.803 --> 35:56.023
- The floor is yours, Max.
- Okay, great, thank you.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.548
And, uh, thank you all
for coming.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.550
Tonight, I have the great
pleasure of introducing

36:01.594 --> 36:03.030
our new palliative care unit,

36:03.073 --> 36:05.467
where our patients will spend
their final days

36:05.511 --> 36:08.253
being cared for
on their own terms.

36:08.296 --> 36:09.776
It's a dream come true
for this hospital.

36:09.819 --> 36:11.473
But it almost didn't happen.

36:11.517 --> 36:13.606
Thanks to a very,
very charitable

36:13.649 --> 36:15.912
last-minute donation,
we can now call

36:15.956 --> 36:17.523
this one-of-a-kind unit

36:17.566 --> 36:19.438
a permanent feature
here in New Amsterdam.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.440
So now, when you think
of philanthropy,

36:21.483 --> 36:22.832
you will forever think of

36:22.876 --> 36:25.705
the "Ozzie Cobb
Palliative Care Wing."

36:25.748 --> 36:27.924
Take a look at that!
Pretty good, right?

36:27.968 --> 36:30.492
- Oh...thank you!

36:31.014 --> 36:32.799
- Yes!

36:33.930 --> 36:35.802
Look at this guy!

36:35.845 --> 36:37.978
- I--I did n--I--

36:38.021 --> 36:39.632
- I know,
I couldn't agree more.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.329
I think what
you're trying to say

36:41.373 --> 36:43.418
in front of everyone
gathered here today,

36:43.462 --> 36:45.638
our patients--oh, look at
that--the news media,

36:45.681 --> 36:47.944
the print, broadcast
and streaming outlets--

36:47.988 --> 36:49.511
hi there--
is thank you.

36:49.555 --> 36:50.817
Now let's get a few photos
of him

36:50.860 --> 36:52.122
signing the check, shall we?

36:52.166 --> 36:54.473
Let's really
capture this moment

36:54.516 --> 36:57.650
of boundless philanthropy
for everyone to see, huh?

36:58.955 --> 37:01.001
- You're on the hook now.

37:05.571 --> 37:07.747
- Hey, all right!

37:09.488 --> 37:11.359
- Smile, please.
- Yes!

37:12.534 --> 37:14.362
- He's the best, isn't he?

37:19.541 --> 37:22.849

- I don't know what Georgia
would've wanted.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.866
And we were so busy
trying to save our marriage

39:06.909 --> 39:08.998
and deal with my cancer...

39:09.042 --> 39:10.478
I didn't even ask her.

39:15.831 --> 39:17.572
The flowers.

39:17.616 --> 39:20.488
I just feel like
I got the flowers wrong.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.055
- They were beautiful.

39:22.098 --> 39:24.710
- The funeral home, they--

39:24.753 --> 39:27.756
they sent options, and,
you know, I--

39:27.800 --> 39:30.933
I mean, I just let them
choose and then--

39:30.977 --> 39:32.152
What if--what if--
- Max,

39:32.195 --> 39:34.241
you've got to forgive
yourself.

39:39.681 --> 39:42.292
- Maybe I thought if I can

39:42.336 --> 39:45.818
prepare everyone else,
then...I could.

39:45.861 --> 39:47.646
- And?

39:57.569 --> 39:59.571
- What do you want

39:59.614 --> 40:02.661
when the time comes?

40:02.704 --> 40:04.271
- I--

40:04.314 --> 40:05.533
You don't have to...

40:05.577 --> 40:07.622
- Well, someone should know.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.626
- Um...

40:11.670 --> 40:14.281
Luna...

40:14.324 --> 40:17.327
by my side,
singing to me.

40:19.068 --> 40:22.071
Even if I can't hear it.

40:22.115 --> 40:24.944
Just wanna feel
that she's there.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.035
- I'll tell her.

40:35.084 --> 40:36.912
What about you?

40:40.220 --> 40:44.964
- How about we just throw
a big party and call it a day?

40:46.269 --> 40:48.010
- What kind of party?
Are we talking, uh,

40:48.054 --> 40:50.926
piñatas or clowns...

40:50.970 --> 40:52.580
- I was thinking
more dancing.

40:52.624 --> 40:55.714
- Dancing? Okay, so, like
tango or merengue?

40:55.757 --> 40:58.325
See, you gotta be specific
so I get it right.

40:58.368 --> 41:00.893
- Oh, so you're in charge?

41:00.936 --> 41:04.723
- Someone should be.
