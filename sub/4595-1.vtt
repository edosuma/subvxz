It's fine. He called last night,
didn't he?

14:43.430 --> 14:46.430
Yeah, I know, but I just wanted
him to be here to enjoy your
birthday.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.070
It's okay. I'm used to it.

14:48.110 --> 14:50.070
Don't say it. I said nothing.

14:50.110 --> 14:51.740
Except, "Happy birthday."

14:51.780 --> 14:52.810
Thank you, Grandma May.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.240
Love the new hair, by the way.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.150
Oh, thank you. I love it, too.

14:58.380 --> 15:01.080
Okay, birthday girl. Have some
fun.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.690
Get in a little trouble.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.720
All right, I will.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.690
Are you sure your friend's
inside?

15:06.720 --> 15:08.020
Yeah, Jess is there.

15:08.060 --> 15:10.760
Well, I want to see you home by
9:00.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.760
I'm 18.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.200

15:14.300 --> 15:15.570
Okay, bye. Love you.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.270
Bye, little growing thing. Have
fun.

15:19.070 --> 15:23.310
Okay, let's take the bus back to
the Cabana Bay Resort.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.740
I want a cocktail.

15:24.780 --> 15:27.410
It's here. Let's walk.

15:27.450 --> 15:29.480
Hi. Welcome to Universal Orlando

15:29.510 --> 15:30.740
Thank you. You bet.

Hey, baby. Sorry I didn't call
sooner.

15:53.340 --> 15:54.810
I was getting worried.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.540
Well, they grounded all the
flights out of D.C.

15:56.570 --> 15:58.970
I rented a car. Martin's on his
way to New York.

15:59.010 --> 16:00.650
He's fine. What about you? It's
all good

16:00.680 --> 16:02.750
The doctor just said that the
baby is doing great.

16:02.780 --> 16:04.920
As long as it's healthy and I'm
there when it's born,

16:04.950 --> 16:06.080
that's all I care about.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.290
Okay. So you're coming home?

16:08.320 --> 16:10.320
Yeah. I'm gonna drive straight
through. I'll see you tomorrow.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.160
Oh, I have a few things to say
if he wants to talk to me.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.590

you. Bye.

there.

for you.

17:17.589 --> 17:18.819

You want me to walk you up?
Yeah.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.990
Oh, I heard your dad saved the
President.

17:22.030 --> 17:23.329

he's the only dad you have.

Well, I'm Babs, and I'm here

you need.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.910
Well, I hope you have a
wonderful day.

17:37.940 --> 17:39.410
Thanks. And remember,

access to the park,

you called her first.

Are you here?

17:59.300 --> 18:01.530
If I turn around, are you gonna
surprise me?

18:01.570 --> 18:03.030
No. I'm just outside of D.C.

18:03.070 --> 18:04.440
I'll surprise you tomorrow,
though.

18:04.470 --> 18:06.270
Well, it's not a surprise if you
tell me.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.860
Okay, see you soon, Dad.

18:10.310 --> 18:11.110
Excuse me

18:11.140 --> 18:11.910
Just put your phone and your
purses

18:12.780 --> 18:13.580
over in the cupboard over there.
Oh, ok

18:13.610 --> 18:16.480
And then step over here... Thank
you.

18:16.510 --> 18:17.870
for the front-row experience.

gonna sit this one out.

Levinson,

19:06.100 --> 19:08.230
who is about to interview
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann.

19:08.270 --> 19:09.670

19:09.700 --> 19:11.170
the President of the United
States

19:11.200 --> 19:13.270
called for an immediate
evacuation

19:13.300 --> 19:14.760
of all of the cities that are

19:14.810 --> 19:16.970
on the eastern seaboard of the
United States,

19:17.010 --> 19:19.280
but it's still very premature.

19:19.310 --> 19:22.010
And do you know anything about
the nature of these shark
storms?

19:22.050 --> 19:23.180
Are they growing in size?

19:23.210 --> 19:24.940
It appears that they are,

19:24.980 --> 19:26.950
but no one knows for sure. It's
still premature.

19:26.980 --> 19:28.640
I'm sorry, Tom. I've got to go.

19:28.690 --> 19:30.120

19:43.530 --> 19:44.560
You enjoy the ride? Yeah.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.070
I have your things. Thank you.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.000
Now remember, if you need
anything else

19:48.040 --> 19:50.340
here at Universal Orlando, just
ask for Babs.

19:50.370 --> 19:51.330
All right. Okay?

19:51.380 --> 19:52.340
Thank you. All right.

destruction and mayhem

20:06.090 --> 20:07.890
that is Washington, D.C., right
now.

20:07.930 --> 20:10.760
The Sharknado has pretty much
destroyed everything in sight.

HEIDI: Traffic continues to be
at a standstill on I-95.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.520
You might want to try Route 17.

20:15.570 --> 20:17.240
I don't blame the sharks on this
destruction.

20:17.270 --> 20:19.070
I blame one Fin Shepard. It
seems like

20:19.100 --> 20:20.430
everywhere he goes, destruction
follows.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.940
Do not think it's a weather
anomaly.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.070
I think he has a plan,

20:24.110 --> 20:25.980
and wherever he goes, he
destroys.

20:26.010 --> 20:28.410
Nobody else survives, yet Fin
Shepard

20:28.450 --> 20:31.580
and his family seem to always
survive just fine.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.420
We'll be back in just a moment

Hey, Fin.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.720
We are proud to announce today

23:25.750 --> 23:29.150
that we have here on loan from
NASCAR

23:29.190 --> 23:31.230
Brad Keselowski's stock car

23:31.260 --> 23:33.530
along with the Xfinity stock
car.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.900
These are the exact replicas of
Brad's car,

23:35.930 --> 23:37.900
and he will be here today onsite

23:37.930 --> 23:39.560
to sign autographs for all of
you

23:39.600 --> 23:41.900
after the Daytona 500.

23:41.940 --> 23:44.940
You didn't look very Semper
Paratus in that ditch.

23:44.970 --> 23:47.600
I rented a car. I had to
improvise.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.440
How'd you know where I was?

23:49.480 --> 23:51.450
I've been tracking all this
activity since L.A.

23:53.380 --> 23:56.080
Teamed up with Lucas, and we
decided to learn all that we
could,

23:56.120 --> 23:58.290
plan ahead,

23:58.320 --> 23:59.920
saving as many lives as
possible.

23:59.960 --> 24:03.190
Of course, slaying sharks along
the way.

24:03.220 --> 24:06.220
And, um, my tracking app showed
that you were close.

24:06.260 --> 24:07.700
Tracking app?

24:07.730 --> 24:09.860
You know where I'm at at all
times?

24:09.900 --> 24:12.570
Friends are supposed to look out
for each other, right?

24:12.600 --> 24:16.040
Yeah. You know, as a matter of
fact, that works both ways.

24:16.070 --> 24:19.540
Nova, where have you been? It's
been over a year

24:19.570 --> 24:21.370
since I've heard from you. I was
worried.

24:21.410 --> 24:23.880
If you really wanted to find me,
you could have.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.580
There's a lot of work to get
done.

24:27.620 --> 24:30.050
A lot of it. She's quite
obsessive,

24:30.090 --> 24:31.750
a little bit insane, bordering
on savant,

24:31.790 --> 24:35.090
and, uh, rocks leather like no
one I've ever met.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.380
Yeah. If the world goes to hell,

24:36.420 --> 24:38.580
it's her you want by your side.

24:38.630 --> 24:41.100
The feeling's mutual.

24:41.130 --> 24:43.770
April's due any day. I was on my
way to Orlando

24:43.800 --> 24:45.430
to meet up with her and Claud.

24:46.970 --> 24:48.270
You're having a baby?

24:49.570 --> 24:52.610
Another child with April.

24:53.980 --> 24:56.780
I guessed. Lucas Stevens.

24:56.810 --> 24:58.450
Yeah, sorry. This is Lucas.

24:58.480 --> 24:59.850
He helps maintain the Beast.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.150
You travel with your own
mechanic now?

25:02.180 --> 25:04.940
Well, mechanic- slash-bodyguard.

25:04.990 --> 25:06.550
Anyway, I gotta check the data.

25:06.590 --> 25:08.090
I think you're gonna love

25:08.120 --> 25:09.710
what we've done with the place.
Come on.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.440
You gotta be kidding me.

25:26.270 --> 25:29.130
I don't know whether to be
impressed or concerned.

25:29.180 --> 25:31.180
MAN: I have intel on that big
storm you were asking about...

25:31.210 --> 25:32.780
The data on Washington is still
coming in.

25:32.810 --> 25:33.770
Lucas: Great, send it over

25:33.920 --> 25:36.350
Who are you talking to? MAN:
Intel on its way.

25:36.380 --> 25:37.280
Nova and I made a pact

25:37.320 --> 25:38.620
we wouldn't tell anybody where
we get--

25:38.650 --> 25:40.180
I have some connections over at
the N.W.S.

25:40.220 --> 25:42.190
What we've done, what we do,

25:42.220 --> 25:44.320
what we can do, it's
polarizing.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.460
You know, we're still getting
crap for bombs in the tornado,

25:46.490 --> 25:49.520
but the collateral damage that
the tornadoes made themselves

25:49.560 --> 25:51.520
was worse than anything the
bombs could have done.

25:51.570 --> 25:53.330
But at the end of the day,

25:53.370 --> 25:56.240
the crazy chick with
posttraumatic shark disorder,

25:56.270 --> 25:57.670
my abnormally genius best
friend,

25:57.710 --> 25:59.840
and the man with the chainsaw,

25:59.870 --> 26:02.170
no one else can get the job done
like we can.

26:02.210 --> 26:03.950
Boy, have you changed.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.780
We analyzed every aspect of the
storms in L.A. and New York.

26:06.820 --> 26:09.980
That Freon thing you did in New
York was way cool, by the way.

26:10.020 --> 26:11.290
What'd I say?

26:11.320 --> 26:13.020
I lost my friend Skye in that
storm.

I'm so sorry.

Fin, hey, I've been wanting to
show you this.

Look, I think this is where you
found me.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.040

26:27.070 --> 26:29.040
There's no way I could have
passed through the intestines.

You need to let this go. It's
over.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.340
This isn't over at all.

26:33.370 --> 26:35.170
It won't be over until we figure
out

why this is happening and why it
keeps coming back.

26:37.380 --> 26:39.210

all!

pretty amazing things in a

swallow in the ocean.

common thing regular sharks eat
is?

26:52.260 --> 26:53.430
Fish.

26:53.460 --> 26:56.460
Yes, fish. But sharknado sharks,

26:56.500 --> 26:59.400
they eat something that regular
sharks don't, birds.

reform all at low-pressure

How do you see the role of
social media assisting...

27:48.950 --> 27:51.620
There are redditors on the
OurSharknado subreddit

27:51.650 --> 27:54.580

so that's how we know it's on
its way.

What else we got? Uh...

53:19.080 --> 53:21.350
this one involves several
nuclear weapons.

53:21.420 --> 53:23.520
All right, let's go back to the
first plan.

53:23.590 --> 53:25.860
Well, for this one, we're
probably gonna need NASA.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.810
NASA?

53:27.890 --> 53:29.160
Yeah, we need to create a tower
of flames

53:29.230 --> 53:30.990
60 miles high burning at
temperatures

53:31.060 --> 53:33.060
hotter than the surface of the
sun.

53:33.130 --> 53:34.030
Fin...

53:35.900 --> 53:37.730
you gotta do it.

53:40.570 --> 53:41.740
What?

53:47.580 --> 53:51.080
Dad, it's Fin.

53:51.150 --> 53:53.080
It's hard to get your arms
around what's happening,

53:53.150 --> 53:54.120
but here's what we know.

53:54.180 --> 53:55.440
Cities are emptying out.

53:55.520 --> 53:56.890
The President has placed

53:56.950 --> 53:59.080
this entire nation on high
alert.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.920
And as of now, we're hearing

54:00.990 --> 54:02.730
that three sharknadoes have hit
Charleston,

54:02.790 --> 54:04.380
wiping out the entire city.

54:04.460 --> 54:06.830
In fact, sharknadoes have now
been reported

54:06.900 --> 54:08.530
all up and down the east coast.

54:08.600 --> 54:11.100
There is concern the storms will
grow in frequency

54:11.170 --> 54:12.900
and then, of course, in size.

54:12.970 --> 54:15.570
How are we gonna get to Cape
Canaveral?

54:17.540 --> 54:18.480
FIN: That's how.

54:26.380 --> 54:29.040
BABS: You can't take those cars!

54:29.120 --> 54:31.220
You can't take those cars!

54:31.290 --> 54:34.190
I'm gonna lose my job! [ sighs ]

54:50.110 --> 54:52.940
You guys need anything else?

54:53.010 --> 54:54.650
No, Flo. We're good to go.

54:54.710 --> 54:55.950
Thanks, darlin'.

54:56.010 --> 54:58.440
So your son's got himself

54:58.520 --> 55:00.780
in a little situation, huh?

55:00.850 --> 55:02.690
Knowing Fin,

55:02.750 --> 55:05.110
he's just making it up as he
goes along.

55:05.190 --> 55:08.730
I've been shot down over Da
Nang, flamed out over Kuwait.

55:08.790 --> 55:11.900
Pretty sure I saw a UFO when I
was in the space shuttle,

55:11.960 --> 55:15.430
but I wouldn't want to fight a
shark.

55:15.500 --> 55:16.430
[ shudders ]

55:16.500 --> 55:18.800
[ chuckles ]

55:20.500 --> 55:22.260
Are you okay?

55:22.340 --> 55:25.310
Yeah. I'll do this myself.

55:29.610 --> 55:30.970
¶

55:32.620 --> 55:35.790
So Neil says--You know, how
serious Neil can be.

55:35.850 --> 55:37.520
Totally straight-faced, he says,

55:37.590 --> 55:40.790
"Buzz, still think it would be
good on your résumé."

55:40.860 --> 55:42.530
[ laughs ]

55:42.590 --> 55:44.630
Oh, my gosh. That's Fin Shepard.
Yeah, it is.

55:44.700 --> 55:47.030
Oh, hi, Fin.

55:47.100 --> 55:49.330
Well, we'll let, uh--We'll let
you two talk.

55:53.700 --> 55:57.530
Hey, Dad. I take it O'Malley's
is closed.

55:57.610 --> 56:00.510
O'Malley sold the bar to his
idiot kid,

56:00.580 --> 56:05.320
who turned it into a fast-food
fun-land kiddie monstrosity,

56:05.380 --> 56:08.950
so I bought it back, changed it
into this.

56:09.020 --> 56:10.490
You know why?

56:10.550 --> 56:12.750
So I could have a place to come
home to.

56:17.360 --> 56:19.130
That Claudia out there?

56:19.200 --> 56:21.700
Yeah. Wow.

56:21.770 --> 56:24.370
She's even prettier than her
pictures.

56:25.370 --> 56:27.040
Do me a favor, huh?

56:28.510 --> 56:30.840
Just ask her to call me Colonel,
okay?

56:30.910 --> 56:32.880
Yeah, sure thing.

56:32.940 --> 56:34.370
Who's the other one?

56:35.380 --> 56:37.850
Boy or girl?

56:37.910 --> 56:39.670
It's gonna be a surprise.

56:39.750 --> 56:42.350
You know, kid, the best thing
you ever did

56:42.420 --> 56:44.890
was winning the heart of that
cheerleader.

56:44.960 --> 56:48.390
Too bad you screwed it up so
royally.

56:48.460 --> 56:49.560
Dad, I need your help.

56:49.630 --> 56:51.400
In fact, we all need your help.

56:51.460 --> 56:53.100
I got a plan.

56:53.160 --> 56:56.220
These storms, they're gonna
merge,

56:56.300 --> 56:59.070
and when they do, it's gonna
destroy everything.

56:59.140 --> 57:01.770
Those bombs we dropped last
time, it's not gonna cut it.

57:01.840 --> 57:03.610
We need to create a lot of heat

57:03.670 --> 57:06.170
in the eye to equalize the
pressure,

57:06.240 --> 57:08.340
and then we need to give these
storms a place to go

57:08.410 --> 57:09.910
and take these sharks with them

57:09.980 --> 57:12.220
so they don't rain down on
millions of people.

57:13.750 --> 57:15.720
So you really are saving the
world.

57:17.590 --> 57:19.290
How do I fit in?

57:21.220 --> 57:24.320
[ thunder crashes ]

57:31.570 --> 57:33.640
We gotta go. The storm is
coming.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.630
Gilbert Grayson Shepard,

57:35.710 --> 57:38.410
but you can call me Colonel.

57:38.480 --> 57:39.510
Sit down, darlin'.

57:40.910 --> 57:42.980
It's nice to meet you.

57:43.050 --> 57:44.820
Fin says you work at NASA.

57:44.880 --> 57:47.080
I was in the astronaut program.

57:47.150 --> 57:48.790
The shuttle's solid rocket
boosters

57:48.850 --> 57:51.460
and the engine combined could
produce enough heat.

57:51.520 --> 57:54.260
It'd be like a column of flame
that would dissipate the storm.

57:54.320 --> 57:57.750
Everyone knows the space
shuttles are retired,

57:57.830 --> 57:59.260
kind of like me.

57:59.330 --> 58:00.630
A whole career,

58:00.700 --> 58:02.630
never once got into outer space.

58:02.700 --> 58:04.730
Well, there always has been
rumors

58:04.800 --> 58:06.300
about a secret military shuttle.

58:06.370 --> 58:10.070
Don't believe everything you
hear.

58:10.140 --> 58:12.580
If there's some top-secret
classified shuttle,

58:12.640 --> 58:14.240
we have to use it.

58:14.310 --> 58:16.650
Millions of people are gonna
die.

58:16.710 --> 58:19.240
This could be a chance to save
them. You could save them.

58:19.320 --> 58:21.280
If this shuttle exists,

58:21.350 --> 58:22.650
we have to try.

58:22.720 --> 58:24.620
Divulging classified information

58:24.690 --> 58:27.290
will get you 25 years in
Leavenworth.

58:27.360 --> 58:30.760
Maybe you could talk to your
friend, the President,

58:30.830 --> 58:32.100
and he could help us out.

58:32.160 --> 58:34.030
I could ask.

58:38.640 --> 58:42.140
Jonesy? Shepard here.

58:42.210 --> 58:45.280
The Independence needs to fly.

58:56.650 --> 58:58.010
I can't believe I'm saying this,

58:58.050 --> 59:00.850
but a massive sharknado wall

59:00.890 --> 59:03.860
that stretches literally up and
down the east coast.

59:03.890 --> 59:06.050
What is the safety zone for
people

We're less than 100 miles from
there.

59:15.010 --> 59:15.740

apocalyptic,

59:23.880 --> 59:25.450

trough dominating the region.

59:33.260 --> 59:35.960

you crazy?

59:35.990 --> 59:39.460
Brian "Jonesy" Jones, NASA
Administrator, meet my son
Finlay.

59:39.500 --> 59:42.170
Mr. Shepard, heard a lot about
you.

59:42.200 --> 59:43.900
The Colonel can't stop talking
about you.

59:43.930 --> 59:45.060
Can't?

59:45.100 --> 59:47.340
Look, I passed your message

59:47.370 --> 59:49.010
on to the White House.
Everything's fine, but...

59:49.040 --> 59:50.840
But what? We're not ready.

59:50.870 --> 59:52.500
Look, we've only got
Independence

59:52.540 --> 59:54.180
at the 80% fuel capacity level,

59:54.210 --> 59:56.010
and you're gonna use that to
dissipate the storm,

59:56.050 --> 59:58.180
and that means pfft. I
understand that.

59:58.210 --> 01:00:00.010
That's why I'm going on this
mission alone.

01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:01.420
No, we're going alone.

01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:03.350
No, we're not. You heard what he
said.

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:05.220
It may not work. Now, you're
gonna be a new dad.

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:06.760
I can handle this myself.

01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:09.190
It might not work is exactly why
I have to go.

can prep the shuttle.

call-up,

but you are the ones to pull
this off.

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.750
I'm counting on you to complete
the countdown process

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.950

be fine.

Not open for discussion.

Gilbert, listen.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.680
I know you helped design the
flight systems,

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:03.650
but this isn't a simulator.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.680
You've never actually flown a
shuttle.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.750
Nobody has ever flown it though
a sharknado before.

01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:11.590
I'm as qualified as anyone.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.490
Just promise you'll be careful,

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.080
and keep her in one piece.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:17.090
For this to work, we gotta blast
off

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:21.430
at the right moment and find a
hole in the wall.

[ sighs ] I don't think being
careful is an option, guys.

through that wall.

Not to mention the sharks.

Shepard.

dad's gig.

Heh. You're going out in space,
aren't you?

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:43.180
Yeah. Last I checked,

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.820
those were the only
requirements.

01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:46.210
And don't worry about

talk about.

seem.

It's not space I'm worried
about.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.220
It's the sharks.

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:57.270
Maybe the sharks will help with
the aliens.

take risks?

Anyway, your dad sent me to give
this to you.

I think he has a crush on me.

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.210

own.

tell you,

great father this time.

Just don't die, okay?

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.060
I'll work on that.

You take care of yourself now.

01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:03.430

You guys are a great family.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.270
Thank you.

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.470
It's kind of crazy, huh?

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:45.840
Can't believe Fin's going up in
that shuttle.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.280
He's what?

01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:48.950
He didn't tell you yet?

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.780
No!

¶

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:47.330
The Sharknado wall is going to
hit! Let's move it, people!

01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:48.870
We gotta get them in the air
now!

01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:50.170
Independence, Control.

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:51.880
We have to get you in the air
now.

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:54.010
You won't be able to launch if
the wall reaches you.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.100
Okay!

01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:02.690
Fin! Fin, stop!

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.090
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.360
Get back down to Mission
Control!

01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:07.290
You're not getting on that
shuttle.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.150
You're coming back with me!
That's not an option!

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:11.320
Are those sharks falling?

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.460
They're gonna hit the shuttle!

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.730
Shouldn't we stop the launch?

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:16.230
No, we'll send the National
Guard

01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:17.670
to protect the shuttle.

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.900
I can't believe you're doing
this,

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.570
and you didn't even tell me!

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.400
Because I knew you would talk me
out of it.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.210
COLONEL: Son, we gotta go now.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.840
My mom was right. About what?

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.240
That you don't know how to stop
being a hero.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.750
This isn't about being a hero.

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.250
This is about us. This is about
our family.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.550
Have you seen what's going on
outside?

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:36.910
These storms, they just keep
getting bigger!

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:39.880
Every shark in the world must be
flying around out there.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.180
If I can do this, maybe we get
some peace.

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.030
I'm coming back,

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.390
and when I do, I'm never gonna
leave you again.

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:50.320
Promise?

01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:53.970
COLONEL: Fin, get up here now!

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.260
I promise.

01:05:55.310 --> 01:05:56.840
I love you.

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:00.640
Come on.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.310
Fin!

01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:09.250
April!

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:11.750
Give me your hand!

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.730
Come on.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.560
We're at 30 seconds and
counting.

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:19.420
The National Guard has arrived.

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.390
Put yourself in front of the
shuttle.

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:23.300
Don't let any sharks hit it.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.970
Open fire!

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.900
Not one shark gets back to the
shuttle!

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.940
[ gunfire ]

01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:38.550
Come on!

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:43.490
Colonel Shepard, We're about to
initiate the launch sequence.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.120
Copy? Colonel Shepard?

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.090
COLONEL: Fin! They're starting
the countdown!

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.920
Come on, we've got to get you
suited up!

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.960
Hurry up! Get in the chair, and
buckle up!

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.630
We're now at T minus 10.

01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:57.800
Welcome aboard, son!

T-They're not gonna make it.

01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:05.480
5, 4... They're not gonna make
it!

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:08.250
LAUNCH DIRECTOR: Abort! Abort!

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:12.270
Sir, are we launching?

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.480
We can't.

01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:23.460
The wall is too thick.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.430
FIN: We need to make a hole in
the wall.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:29.660
APRIL: I think we need Nova. All
right.

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.800
FIN: Mission Control, find Nova!

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.480
Are you okay?

01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:40.680
I'm not good, but save yourself.

01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:43.150
You're too late for me. Get out
of here!

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.180
More sharks! Sharks!

[ gun clicks ] I'm out of
bullets.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.320
There's no time for makeup, man!
Get out of here!

You owe me one, Fin.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.830
I've got visual on the shuttle.

01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:39.970

Are you crazy? We can't go out
there.

01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:48.279
Yes, we can. Let's go.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.279

path.

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:54.920
NOVA: It's working! Get ready to
launch.

01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.080
Are we back on for launch? Yep.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.720
You guys are clear to launch! Go
now!

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.630
Everybody ready?

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:04.399

What are you doing out here?

01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:12.370
Thought you could use some help!

You're crazy! Get back inside!
Let's go!

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:16.910
Get down!

01:09:16.939 --> 01:09:18.109
Help me!

01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:22.550
Go grab a gun!

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.550
Gun? What do I do with this
thing?

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.580
Shoot it!

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:29.920
Shoot it? If I can hold it.

[ fires ] Whaah!

01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:36.560
How are you so good at that?

I'm a Shepard!

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.800
Don't worry, son.

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:41.899
It's like riding a bike.

01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:45.200
Not any bike I ever rode.

01:09:46.939 --> 01:09:48.939
I didn't want our first date to
be like this!

01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:51.200
Rather we watched a movie!

Billy, no! No! No.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.480
Please, Billy!

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.480
No!

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:18.930
Hang on! Hang on!

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.390
Get ready. We only have 10
seconds

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:23.400
to release the rockets and
destroy the sharknado wall.

01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:25.390
Ready. Now!

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.800

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.080
Mr. Officer, confirm staging a
good solid rocket booster
separation.

SUPERVISOR: Detonate the SRBs.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.990
Hang on!

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:46.090
Now get ready to jettison the
external fuel tank.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.250
FIN: Not yet. Not yet.

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:55.190
COLONEL: Veering off course!
Veering off course!

01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:56.190
What?

01:11:56.230 --> 01:11:58.030
Five degrees port!

01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:59.870
Watch your pitch! Watch your
pitch!

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.810
One degree yaw!

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.810
SUPERVISOR: Colonel Shepard, do
you read?

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.310
This is Mission Control.

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.800
Lose the external fuel tank to
get into orbit.

01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:09.580
I'm going to use the OMS
thrusters

01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:11.810
to boost us up to a higher
orbit.

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:13.750
All right, good. Good.

01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:15.250
Now!

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:22.490
SUPERVISOR: All right. Detonate
the external fuel tank.

01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.300
There she comes. She's coming
around. She's coming around.

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.980
The heat from the rocket should
have a domino effect.

01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:44.650
See? It's happening.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.040
April, you good?

01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:48.990
I'm good.

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.820
Wow.

01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:53.220
This is beautiful.

01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:59.330
I think you should take a look
at this.

01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:04.270
Quick, what've you got?

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:09.640
It didn't work. The storm wall
is still there.

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:12.000
Independence, we are picking up
storm activity.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:12.970
Damn it!

01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:16.210
The storm's too big.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:17.880
It's not working.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.320
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:21.320
Sorry? Heh.

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:22.720
We're not dead yet.

01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:29.520
What are you doing?

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.830
Plan B.

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:31.900
What the hell's that?

01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:33.870
Strategic Defense Initiative.

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.900
Star Wars? I thought that didn't
work.

01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:38.690
That's what you're supposed to
think,

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:41.370
but I've been working on it
almost my entire career.

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:44.380
It's probably why I didn't get
into space until now.

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:47.950
We've been redefining the
technology for years.

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.280
So much power now.

01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:54.710
If we fire that thing directly
into the storm,

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.420
it should ionize the water
vapor,

01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:58.480
give us enough room to collapse
it.

We're gonna try and use the SDI
satellite system to fight this
storm.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.770
I need to speak with Major Rene
Joubert.

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:22.410
ANNOUNCER: The sharknado has
completely devastated the entire
eastern seaboard.

01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:26.280
Half the nation's population is
retreating to shelters.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.090
The government is unable to do
anything to stop this disaster,

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.420
but we're not leaving. No.

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:34.790
It's been great working with all
of you.

Bonjour, Rene!

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:42.630
I hear you want to do

01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:44.840
something impossible and
dangerous,

01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:46.300
which is not surprising.

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:47.940
I know it sounds stupid,

01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:50.140
but, uh, we need to reactivate

01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:53.000

fly.

Without the fuel tank, how could
they retrieve Colonel Shepard?

They can't.
