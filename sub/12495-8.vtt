WEBVTT

00:16.767 --> 00:19.812
No, no. Move all those things

00:16.767 --> 00:19.812
to the side.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.605
All right, all right.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.028
Hey, you guys.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.698
Hey.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.698
You're late for work.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.659
It's not my fault. There was

00:30.739 --> 00:33.659
a line at The Corn Doggery.

00:34.827 --> 00:37.454
You got us corn dogs?

00:34.827 --> 00:37.454
Yeah, dude.

00:37.621 --> 00:40.081
This is not

00:37.621 --> 00:40.081
corn dog time.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.250
Okay, give me

00:40.708 --> 00:42.250
a corn dog.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.840
So, what is

00:45.713 --> 00:47.840
all this?

00:47.882 --> 00:50.718
That is a big rock.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.761
From outer space.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.056
No, I mean,

00:53.721 --> 00:56.056
what's this crane for?

00:56.097 --> 01:00.811
To move the rock.

00:56.097 --> 01:00.811
It weighs over 7,000 pounds.

01:00.853 --> 01:04.690
Wow. Can I borrow this crane

01:00.853 --> 01:04.690
to move my big Uncle Rosco?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.735
Because he's been on our couch

01:05.399 --> 01:07.735
since Christmas.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.322
- Darn it.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.324
Which one of these

01:12.364 --> 01:14.324
controls makes the--

01:15.826 --> 01:18.913
(distant crashing)

01:24.209 --> 01:25.794
You dropped the rock.

01:27.295 --> 01:28.547
Wow, that thing

01:27.295 --> 01:28.547
is gonna fall

01:28.589 --> 01:30.632
all the way down

01:28.589 --> 01:30.632
to the Man Cave.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.176
Ray!

01:37.598 --> 01:39.558
(beeping)

01:41.810 --> 01:45.188
Hey, I can't talk.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.188
I'm hula-sizing with Laylani.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.858
Ray, there's a 7,000-pound

01:45.981 --> 01:47.858
space rock

01:47.900 --> 01:49.150
on its way down there.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.613
There's a what on its way

01:50.694 --> 01:52.613
down where?

01:52.654 --> 01:54.406
(screams)

01:57.076 --> 01:58.786
(Laylani)

01:57.076 --> 01:58.786
Ray?

02:05.208 --> 02:07.878
Ray? You there?

02:05.208 --> 02:07.878
What happened?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.421
I don't know.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.924
Ray, a very heavy rock is about

02:09.463 --> 02:11.924
to crash through your ceiling.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.762
Yeah.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.762
Thanks for the heads up.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.184
It all just kind of happened.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.312
My dad was

02:23.226 --> 02:25.312
an irresponsible scientist.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.522
I wanted an afterschool job.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.317
And by accident,

02:27.564 --> 02:30.317
he made me indestructible.

02:30.358 --> 02:31.610
(screams)

02:31.652 --> 02:33.361
(Henry)

02:31.652 --> 02:33.361
I went into this crazy store

02:34.071 --> 02:35.280
and met

02:34.071 --> 02:35.280
a pretty interesting guy.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.407
I'm gonna blow your mind.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.828
Now I protect the good citizens

02:37.449 --> 02:40.828
of Swellview. Who call me...

02:40.869 --> 02:41.829
He turned out to be...

02:41.870 --> 02:43.163
(Ray)

02:41.870 --> 02:43.163
You know the name.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.290
Captain Man.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.290
That's right, Henry.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.002
(Ray)

02:45.332 --> 02:48.002
In time, I realized

02:45.332 --> 02:48.002
that being a superhero

02:48.043 --> 02:49.628
is a lot to handle alone.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.964
He wanted some help.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.964
(Ray)

02:49.670 --> 02:51.964
I needed a sidekick.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.674
I, Henry hart...

02:53.715 --> 02:55.174
(Ray)

02:53.715 --> 02:55.174
Pledge to never ever, ever

02:53.715 --> 02:55.174
tell anyone...

02:55.216 --> 02:56.802
That I'm Captain Man's

02:55.216 --> 02:56.802
secret sidekick.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.261
It is done.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.555
(Henry)

02:58.303 --> 03:00.555
Now we blow bubbles.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.555
(Ray)

02:58.303 --> 03:00.555
And fight crime.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.390
(Henry)

03:00.597 --> 03:02.390
Feels good.

03:15.988 --> 03:19.074
- Call it.

03:15.988 --> 03:19.074
- Up the tube!

03:19.116 --> 03:19.867
Oh, my boots.

03:20.826 --> 03:21.952
(Ray screams)

03:27.332 --> 03:28.083
Henry!

03:29.710 --> 03:32.462
What, Piper?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.462
Make Jasper leave.

03:33.212 --> 03:35.298
No. I told him

03:33.212 --> 03:35.298
he could use my room.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.343
But he's doing his stupid

03:35.340 --> 03:38.343
bucket podcast.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.636
So?

03:39.678 --> 03:41.388
He's sucking up

03:39.678 --> 03:41.388
all our bandwidth.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.349
He'll be done soon.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.186
But I'm trying to download

03:44.391 --> 03:47.186
the new Ginger Fox music video

03:47.227 --> 03:49.063
and it's taking forever.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.192
Look, I told Jasper he could

03:49.938 --> 03:53.192
do his podcast from my room,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.276
and that's how it is.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.029
Well, why can't he do

03:55.318 --> 03:57.029
his dumb podcast

03:57.071 --> 03:58.697
from his own dumb house?

03:59.239 --> 04:02.076
Because Jasper's parents

03:59.239 --> 04:02.076
don't believe in the Internet.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.037
That's not my problem!

04:05.579 --> 04:07.288
Why don't I go check

04:05.579 --> 04:07.288
on Jasper?

04:07.330 --> 04:08.916
Yeah, why don't you?

04:12.753 --> 04:16.006
So, Ron, I hear that you went

04:12.753 --> 04:16.006
to BucketCon in San Diego.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.632
Yeah. It was wild.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.595
And I picked up a lot

04:19.134 --> 04:21.595
of bucket knowledge there.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.765
So many great people.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.433
Great, great people.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.771
Hey, my pal Henry

04:28.435 --> 04:30.771
just walked in.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.814
Maybe we'll get him to

04:30.812 --> 04:32.814
come on our podcast later

04:32.856 --> 04:34.315
and talk buckets with us.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.693
Or not.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.989
So, Ron, I understand

04:38.862 --> 04:40.989
that you learned

04:41.031 --> 04:43.617
everything you know about

04:41.031 --> 04:43.617
buckets from your father.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.954
That is correct. My dad

04:43.658 --> 04:46.954
is a certified bucket master.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.207
Right, and I hear he's making

04:47.662 --> 04:50.207
a documentary about--

04:51.625 --> 04:52.626
Yeah, sure.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.045
Okay.

04:55.087 --> 04:58.381
Until next time, this is

04:55.087 --> 04:58.381
Jasper Dunlop sending you...

04:59.340 --> 05:01.009
Buckets of love.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.639
Oh my God.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.639
Hey, great show, Ron.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.017
Ah, dang it.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.017
What now?

05:09.559 --> 05:11.853
For one hour they were

05:09.559 --> 05:11.853
letting everyone download

05:11.895 --> 05:14.022
the new Ginger Fox video

05:11.895 --> 05:14.022
for free!

05:14.982 --> 05:19.111
Now I got to pay for it!

05:14.982 --> 05:19.111
Thanks a lot, Jasper.

05:20.195 --> 05:24.699
You know, Piper,

05:20.195 --> 05:24.699
you have an attitude problem.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.409
(screaming)

05:32.707 --> 05:34.042
(Henry)

05:32.707 --> 05:34.042
Break it up!

05:35.877 --> 05:38.546
Your sister's nuts!

05:35.877 --> 05:38.546
You better just go.

05:38.588 --> 05:42.217
All right. Come on, Ron.

05:38.588 --> 05:42.217
This isn't over, Jasper!

05:42.717 --> 05:45.887
You're going to pay

05:42.717 --> 05:45.887
in this life or the next.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.473
(screaming)

05:53.103 --> 05:54.688
Calm down.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.688
No!

05:54.729 --> 05:55.856
- Use your words.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.649
No!

05:55.897 --> 05:57.649
Use your words.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.622
Ray, what's wrong?

06:10.578 --> 06:12.622
Shh.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.374
Shh.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.374
How come you guys are--

06:15.416 --> 06:19.378
- Shh.

06:15.416 --> 06:19.378
- Why are you

06:15.416 --> 06:19.378
shushing me?

06:20.255 --> 06:21.673
I don't know.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.673
They started it.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.801
Will you two be quiet?

06:22.257 --> 06:24.801
We have a situation.

06:24.843 --> 06:25.844
What's going on?

06:36.063 --> 06:39.066
Okay, you're gonna have to

06:36.063 --> 06:39.066
use your words.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.277
Look at the space rock.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.112
What the Jack

06:42.319 --> 06:44.112
happened?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.992
It hatched.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.992
What do you mean

06:46.240 --> 06:48.992
it hatched?

06:49.034 --> 06:51.370
It's a rock. Rocks don't hatch.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.370
Do rocks hatch?

06:52.204 --> 06:53.747
No. Eggs hatch.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.290
So...

06:55.332 --> 06:57.334
The space rock was

06:55.332 --> 06:57.334
really a space egg?

06:57.376 --> 06:59.169
Yeah.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.963
And last night it hatched and

06:59.211 --> 07:01.963
some thing crawled out of it.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.842
Well, where'd it go?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.842
We don't know.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.263
But it left that

07:07.468 --> 07:09.263
purple slime trail.

07:10.347 --> 07:14.475
So, you're saying that

07:10.347 --> 07:14.475
some creature from outer space

07:14.517 --> 07:16.395
crawled out of

07:14.517 --> 07:16.395
that egg rock

07:16.436 --> 07:18.313
and now it's somewhere

07:16.436 --> 07:18.313
around here,

07:18.355 --> 07:20.190
but you don't know

07:18.355 --> 07:20.190
where it is?

07:20.232 --> 07:21.191
That's right.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.361
Okay then.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.328
Up the tube.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.168
So, she's gone.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.711
(squeaking)

07:41.753 --> 07:43.380
Oh, I hear it.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.798
Gooch, turn off

07:43.422 --> 07:44.798
all non-essential equipment.

07:44.839 --> 07:45.882
(Gooch)

07:44.839 --> 07:45.882
Right.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.389
(Ray)

07:50.304 --> 07:52.389
Oh my God,

07:50.304 --> 07:52.389
something's squeezing me.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.683
And Henry's gone.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.103
I'm right here.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.985
All right, this is stupid.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.985
We don't need to be afraid.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.946
Easy for you to say.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.946
Yeah, you're indestructible.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.073
No creature

08:08.571 --> 08:10.073
is going to hurt you.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.284
Oh yeah?

08:10.115 --> 08:12.284
What if it crawls up my leg?

08:12.326 --> 08:14.619
I don't need some alien thing

08:12.326 --> 08:14.619
all up in there.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.748
So, what do we do?

08:19.499 --> 08:23.044
I think if we just calmly

08:19.499 --> 08:23.044
search the Man Cave--

08:23.086 --> 08:24.045
(squeaking)

08:24.087 --> 08:25.464
(screaming)

08:40.354 --> 08:42.314
(both)

08:40.354 --> 08:42.314
Up the tube!

09:03.168 --> 09:05.712
Yeah... Yeah,

09:03.168 --> 09:05.712
she's here at my house.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.007
Gooch wants to know

09:07.297 --> 09:09.007
why you're not at work.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.717
I'm not going back there

09:10.758 --> 09:12.177
until somebody catches

09:10.758 --> 09:12.177
that creature

09:12.219 --> 09:12.969
and gets rid of it.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.930
Don't you want to see it?

09:13.678 --> 09:15.930
Yeah, I want to see it.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.849
I want to see it dead.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.810
She says she's not coming

09:19.434 --> 09:20.810
back to work

09:20.852 --> 09:22.479
until we catch the...

09:24.272 --> 09:28.609
You know what. Yeah.

09:24.272 --> 09:28.609
Women do be crazy.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.779
I heard that.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.324
Hey, I left my backpack

09:32.406 --> 09:34.324
down in the...

09:35.658 --> 09:38.412
Oh, you did?

09:35.658 --> 09:38.412
Hey, Piper.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.788
What?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.999
A guy I work with says

09:40.830 --> 09:42.999
he dropped my backpack off here.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.544
Yeah. Mom has it.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.544
Stop bothering me.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.174
Yeah, I got it, thanks.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.174
Okay, later.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.970
So, did you--

09:53.051 --> 09:55.970
did you find out anything

09:56.012 --> 09:58.765
about the space rock

09:56.012 --> 09:58.765
or egg or whatever?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.808
Yeah, and I'm worried.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.808
About?

10:01.726 --> 10:04.354
What if that was just

10:01.726 --> 10:04.354
the first alien space rock egg?

10:05.021 --> 10:07.899
What if more come and then

10:05.021 --> 10:07.899
the aliens take over the Earth

10:07.941 --> 10:09.609
and use us humans as food?

10:11.027 --> 10:12.571
That will never happen.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.571
Why not?

10:12.612 --> 10:15.115
Because... if they're aliens

10:12.612 --> 10:15.115
who traveled here,

10:15.156 --> 10:17.200
that means they'd have

10:15.156 --> 10:17.200
to be highly intelligent.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.452
And highly intelligent

10:17.242 --> 10:18.452
creatures

10:18.493 --> 10:20.828
wouldn't eat

10:18.493 --> 10:20.828
other living creatures.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.961
Wouldn't they?

10:30.964 --> 10:31.798
Oh my God.

10:35.343 --> 10:39.806
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

10:35.343 --> 10:39.806
I am the golden boy.

10:39.847 --> 10:43.726
Showtime.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.061
What are you

10:43.768 --> 10:45.061
all pumped up about?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.854
Yeah, Jasper,

10:45.103 --> 10:46.854
what's up?

10:47.481 --> 10:49.774
You guys know

10:47.481 --> 10:49.774
my latest bucket podcast?

10:49.816 --> 10:54.404
Yeah?

10:49.816 --> 10:54.404
100,007 downloads.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.030
What?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.030
No.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.867
That many people

10:57.991 --> 10:59.867
downloaded your new podcast?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.369
Yes, sir.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.204
And what's the most

11:01.411 --> 11:03.204
you've ever got before?

11:03.246 --> 11:06.082
Seven.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.792
Wow,

11:06.124 --> 11:07.792
that's really great.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.504
I bet this success

11:07.834 --> 11:10.504
makes you feel so much better

11:10.545 --> 11:12.172
about yourself

11:10.545 --> 11:12.172
as a person.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.133
(Jasper)

11:13.923 --> 11:15.133
It does.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.968
Later, I'm going to go

11:15.175 --> 11:16.968
to my Grandma's house

11:17.010 --> 11:18.345
and I'm going to say,

11:18.386 --> 11:21.097
"Hey, Grandma,

11:18.386 --> 11:21.097
who's useless now?"

11:23.099 --> 11:24.767
Good for you, Jasp.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.767
(Jasper)

11:23.099 --> 11:24.767
Thanks.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.394
Hey, can I go

11:24.809 --> 11:26.394
up to your room

11:26.436 --> 11:28.188
and record a special

11:26.436 --> 11:28.188
thank you message for my fans?

11:28.229 --> 11:29.897
Sure.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.897
Thanks.

11:29.939 --> 11:33.067
- Way to go, Jasper.

11:29.939 --> 11:33.067
You're a rock star.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.778
That's how I feel.

11:37.905 --> 11:38.948
Ha!

11:39.574 --> 11:41.201
She did something.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.410
Piper...

11:42.452 --> 11:44.371
Yeah?

11:42.452 --> 11:44.371
What did you do?

11:44.412 --> 11:48.458
Okay. Okay.

11:44.412 --> 11:48.458
I went on a website

11:48.500 --> 11:53.296
and for 10 bucks, I bought

11:48.500 --> 11:53.296
Jasper 100,000 fake downloads.

11:54.881 --> 11:55.882
Well, why

11:54.881 --> 11:55.882
would you do that?

11:55.923 --> 11:58.009
To get him all happy

11:55.923 --> 11:58.009
and excited

11:58.051 --> 11:59.886
so later

11:58.051 --> 11:59.886
I can crush him.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.139
Okay, that's a really

12:01.012 --> 12:03.139
mean thing to--

12:03.181 --> 12:05.099
(screaming)

12:05.141 --> 12:07.018
Mom?

12:05.141 --> 12:07.018
Where's

12:05.141 --> 12:07.018
the bug spray?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.978
I need the bug spray

12:07.060 --> 12:08.978
and a baseball bat.

12:09.020 --> 12:12.148
Mom. Mom. Mom,

12:09.020 --> 12:12.148
what's wrong?

12:09.020 --> 12:12.148
I...

12:12.190 --> 12:13.983
I was down in the basement

12:12.190 --> 12:13.983
washing your backpack

12:14.025 --> 12:15.569
because it was

12:14.025 --> 12:15.569
all sticky inside.

12:15.610 --> 12:19.738
Oh, hi, Charlotte. And there was

12:15.610 --> 12:19.738
this bug or maybe it was a rat,

12:19.780 --> 12:22.741
whatever it was, it jumped on me

12:19.780 --> 12:22.741
and landed on my shoulder.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.081
Uh-oh.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.081
Wha...

12:28.789 --> 12:31.292
I got to go next door

12:28.789 --> 12:31.292
and borrow some bug spray

12:31.334 --> 12:32.919
and maybe a shotgun.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.506
My backpack.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.258
The creature must've crawled

12:36.548 --> 12:38.258
in my backpack at work.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.509
And now it's here.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.594
What are you guys

12:39.551 --> 12:40.594
talking about?

12:40.635 --> 12:42.470
Nothing.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.470
You're nothing.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.765
We got to find

12:45.432 --> 12:46.765
that creature.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.268
Come down to

12:46.807 --> 12:48.268
the basement with me.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.936
I got a better idea.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.936
What?

12:58.486 --> 13:00.447
So... She's gone.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.080
Oh, honey, would you

13:06.745 --> 13:09.080
get down from there?

13:09.122 --> 13:12.125
I'll come down after you

13:09.122 --> 13:12.125
show me its dead lifeless body.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.668
Why are you

13:12.166 --> 13:13.668
so scared of a bug?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.462
It's not just a bug.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.547
It's a huge,

13:15.503 --> 13:17.547
icky creature thing.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.550
Ladies be crazy.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.219
Sometimes ladies

13:21.175 --> 13:23.219
be making sense.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.723
Just go kill it.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.723
All right, I'm going.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.726
Two X chromosomes.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.399
Ray. Ray.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.984
Hey, Henry, I can't talk.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.402
Gooch and I are still looking

13:38.025 --> 13:39.402
for the creature.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.112
Yeah, I don't think

13:39.444 --> 13:41.112
you're going to find it.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.197
Why not?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.197
Because it's in

13:41.154 --> 13:43.197
my house.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.200
What?

13:46.242 --> 13:49.496
Gooch dropped my backpack off

13:46.242 --> 13:49.496
here and I guess it was inside.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.791
Did you see the creature?

13:49.537 --> 13:52.791
No, but it jumped

13:49.537 --> 13:52.791
on my mom.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.586
Oh, man, is your mom okay?

13:53.416 --> 13:56.586
Yeah, she's all right.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.463
Because she is one

13:56.628 --> 13:58.463
fine-looking lady.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.591
Ray, will you just--

14:01.633 --> 14:04.302
(screaming)

14:04.344 --> 14:07.305
What? What happened?

14:04.344 --> 14:07.305
Did you see the bug?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.307
Yep.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.307
Well, did you kill it?

14:09.349 --> 14:10.849
Nope.

14:12.686 --> 14:13.645
You better get over here.

14:19.651 --> 14:23.279
Okay, to all my listeners out

14:19.651 --> 14:23.279
there who've already tuned in,

14:23.321 --> 14:25.740
my next official Just Bucket

14:23.321 --> 14:25.740
live podcast

14:25.782 --> 14:27.908
will begin

14:25.782 --> 14:27.908
in seven minutes.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.995
Yes. Start podding already.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.498
(knocking)

14:34.624 --> 14:36.501
Hey, Jasper.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.714
Sorry, Piper, you can't

14:38.252 --> 14:40.714
bring me down today.

14:41.339 --> 14:46.344
You know why?

14:41.339 --> 14:46.344
100,007 downloads.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.680
I don't want

14:47.011 --> 14:48.680
to bring you down.

14:48.722 --> 14:49.848
I just want to know

14:49.889 --> 14:51.891
if I can maybe

14:49.889 --> 14:51.891
be a guest on your podcast.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.644
Why?

14:54.686 --> 14:57.021
You're not a bucket lover.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.021
You're a bucket hater.

14:58.732 --> 15:02.485
No, no, no.

14:58.732 --> 15:02.485
You got me all wrong, friend.

15:03.820 --> 15:07.615
I'm not a bucket hater.

15:03.820 --> 15:07.615
I'm bucket curious.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.745
You are?

15:09.826 --> 15:11.745
Yeah.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.747
And maybe if I learn

15:11.786 --> 15:13.747
more about them,

15:13.788 --> 15:17.124
one day I could be a bucketeer

15:13.788 --> 15:17.124
like you and all your fans.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.169
Okay. Sure.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.838
You can be a guest

15:20.211 --> 15:21.838
on my podcast.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.716
Great.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.223
Where's the exterminator?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.892
I don't know.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.976
Henry, just go down to the

15:33.933 --> 15:35.976
basement and kill that thing.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.270
Oh, you're going to

15:36.018 --> 15:37.270
send me down there?

15:37.311 --> 15:39.522
Are you crazy?

15:37.311 --> 15:39.522
We are not sending our son

15:39.564 --> 15:42.191
to do battle with some

15:39.564 --> 15:42.191
dangerous, freaky rat-bug.

15:43.568 --> 15:44.611
You're right.

15:45.570 --> 15:49.574
Piper! Mommy and daddy

15:45.570 --> 15:49.574
have something for you to do!

15:49.616 --> 15:51.033
(doorbell rings)

15:51.075 --> 15:51.951
I got it.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.457
Hi.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.958
Hey, what are you--

15:57.498 --> 15:58.958
Just play along.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.837
Hello, citizens of Swellview.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.340
Oh my God, it's Captain Man.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.340
In our house.

16:07.425 --> 16:10.470
What are you doing here?

16:07.425 --> 16:10.470
Well, sometimes I go around

16:10.511 --> 16:14.390
to various neighborhoods

16:10.511 --> 16:14.390
in Swellview taking surveys.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.058
Surveys?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.144
Oh yeah, I heard

16:16.100 --> 16:18.144
about that on the news.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.188
You guys mind

16:18.728 --> 16:21.188
taking a survey?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.064
Not at all.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.190
Go ahead.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.190
Great.

16:23.983 --> 16:28.070
Question one, how often

16:23.983 --> 16:28.070
do you participate in surveys?

16:28.738 --> 16:34.034
A, often, B, rarely, or C,

16:28.738 --> 16:34.034
this is my first survey.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.496
I think this is

16:35.077 --> 16:36.496
our first survey.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.581
I think it is.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.792
Captain Man...

16:38.623 --> 16:40.792
Yes, boy?

16:40.834 --> 16:43.002
Since you just happen

16:40.834 --> 16:43.002
to be here,

16:43.043 --> 16:45.421
maybe you can help us out

16:43.043 --> 16:45.421
with a problem?

16:45.463 --> 16:46.840
Problem?

16:45.463 --> 16:46.840
Yeah.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.800
We got a big scary bug

16:46.881 --> 16:48.800
down in our basement.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.551
A scary bug, huh?

16:50.593 --> 16:53.387
Well, what do you say I take

16:50.593 --> 16:53.387
this down to your basement

16:53.429 --> 16:55.306
and teach that bug

16:53.429 --> 16:55.306
some manners?

16:58.225 --> 17:00.102
That sound good to you,

16:58.225 --> 17:00.102
pretty lady?

17:00.144 --> 17:02.229
It does.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.229
Yeah, it does.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.902
So, good luck,

17:05.358 --> 17:07.902
Captain Man.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.902
Right.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.993
I hope he kills the bug.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.993
Yeah.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.243
Then we can

17:15.034 --> 17:16.243
finish that survey.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.286
Right.

17:18.496 --> 17:21.165
(Captain Man)

17:18.496 --> 17:21.165
Eat laser, slime beast.

17:21.207 --> 17:26.170
You picked the wrong planet

17:21.207 --> 17:26.170
to hatch on. I got you.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.922
Oh my God,

17:26.212 --> 17:27.922
you're not dead.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.635
No, don't bite me there.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.304
You know, I really think

17:33.302 --> 17:35.304
my podcast

17:35.346 --> 17:37.640
is helping spread excitement

17:35.346 --> 17:37.640
about bucketeering.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.976
Amen, brother. Pod on.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.312
(crashing)

17:43.354 --> 17:46.024
Uh, I'm not sure what

17:43.354 --> 17:46.024
all that noise is.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.402
(screaming)

17:50.152 --> 17:51.612
But right now I would like

17:50.152 --> 17:51.612
to introduce you

17:51.654 --> 17:53.447
to a special guest.

17:53.489 --> 17:57.410
So, please put your buckets

17:53.489 --> 17:57.410
together for Piper Hart.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.579
(sound effect

17:57.451 --> 17:59.579
of applause playing)

18:00.538 --> 18:04.000
It's so great to be here,

18:00.538 --> 18:04.000
Jasper. We're live, right?

18:05.125 --> 18:07.211
Oh yeah.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.211
We're live on the web.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.880
Even my grandma

18:07.253 --> 18:08.880
is listening.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.507
Nice.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.385
So, I hear your last podcast

18:11.549 --> 18:14.385
got how many downloads?

18:15.219 --> 18:21.475
100,007. So far.

18:15.219 --> 18:21.475
Wow, impressive.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.394
Isn't it?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.145
It would be...

18:25.187 --> 18:28.107
except that 100,000

18:25.187 --> 18:28.107
of those downloads are fake.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.694
Say what?

18:29.233 --> 18:31.694
Yeah.

18:31.736 --> 18:36.115
I went online and bought you

18:31.736 --> 18:36.115
100,000 fake downloads.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.199
(gasps)

18:38.284 --> 18:39.159
Why?

18:39.869 --> 18:42.080
So you'd think your podcast

18:39.869 --> 18:42.080
was really popular,

18:42.121 --> 18:43.915
which it's not.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.129
(panting)

18:53.507 --> 18:54.425
Hey.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.011
Hi.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.011
What happened?

18:57.053 --> 18:58.554
Did you kill

18:57.053 --> 18:58.554
the creature thing?

18:59.179 --> 19:01.766
Almost. Did you guys

18:59.179 --> 19:01.766
see it crawl up here?

19:01.808 --> 19:02.642
Up here?

19:01.808 --> 19:02.642
What?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.102
You lost it?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.353
No, no. But it crawled

19:04.143 --> 19:06.353
into your air conditioning vent.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.898
I think it might be

19:06.980 --> 19:08.898
headed up to the roof.

19:09.774 --> 19:10.775
You people wait here.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.946
Captain Man?

19:12.652 --> 19:14.946
Yes?

19:14.988 --> 19:18.407
After you kill the thing, are

19:14.988 --> 19:18.407
we going to finish the survey?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.702
Oh yeah.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.412
Will you go kill it?

19:23.454 --> 19:24.455
Right.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.375
So you paid money

19:26.206 --> 19:28.375
just to make me

19:28.417 --> 19:30.920
feel all happy and excited

19:28.417 --> 19:30.920
for nothing?

19:30.962 --> 19:34.674
No. I paid money to make you

19:30.962 --> 19:34.674
feel all happy and excited

19:34.715 --> 19:37.468
so that then I could make you

19:34.715 --> 19:37.468
feel all sad and depressed.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.055
Update, it worked.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.266
(Jasper)

19:42.682 --> 19:44.266
But why would you do that?

19:44.308 --> 19:47.353
Because when you did

19:44.308 --> 19:47.353
your last podcast here

19:47.394 --> 19:49.689
I couldn't download

19:47.394 --> 19:49.689
Ginger Fox's new video.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.484
(Jasper)

19:50.272 --> 19:53.484
Well, I didn't know you were

19:50.272 --> 19:53.484
trying to download something.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.319
Well, you know now,

19:53.526 --> 19:55.319
don't you?

19:56.403 --> 19:59.532
(Jasper)

19:56.403 --> 19:59.532
But couldn't you have just

19:56.403 --> 19:59.532
told me that you were trying--

20:00.199 --> 20:01.826
Captain Man?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.826
What the...

20:01.868 --> 20:03.119
No time for questions.

20:03.161 --> 20:04.996
Die, alien scum!

20:06.413 --> 20:08.708
(Piper)

20:06.413 --> 20:08.708
What's happening?

20:09.750 --> 20:11.460
(Jasper)

20:09.750 --> 20:11.460
What are you shooting at?

20:11.502 --> 20:13.171
An alien!

20:15.131 --> 20:18.926
Best podcast ever.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.229
Oh my God.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.229
The creature!

20:31.981 --> 20:33.232
(screaming)

20:34.901 --> 20:37.528
- Mom!

20:37.570 --> 20:39.072
Wait! Come back!

20:37.570 --> 20:39.072
(Piper)

20:37.570 --> 20:39.072
No!

20:43.576 --> 20:47.121
Well, I may not have

20:43.576 --> 20:47.121
100,000 downloads...

20:47.788 --> 20:52.126
but at least I don't have

20:47.788 --> 20:52.126
a slimey alien stuck to my face.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.006
- It's on my face.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.883
It's on my face.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.384
It's on my face.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.386
It's on my face.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.471
Everything's under control.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.471
Little girl!

21:04.513 --> 21:07.016
Stop running so I can

21:04.513 --> 21:07.016
shoot it off your face!

21:09.435 --> 21:12.396
He'll probably just

21:09.435 --> 21:12.396
shoot it off her face.

21:12.438 --> 21:17.568
(zapping, screaming)

21:17.610 --> 21:19.028
(Captain Man)

21:17.610 --> 21:19.028
I got you.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.704
Well, the creature chewed

21:26.619 --> 21:28.704
her cheek up a little,

21:28.746 --> 21:30.123
but she's okay.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.251
I am not okay!

21:34.668 --> 21:37.046
Oh, Piper,

21:34.668 --> 21:37.046
don't be a drama queen.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.174
Seriously.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.636
What about the creature?

21:41.592 --> 21:43.636
Did you kill it?

21:43.677 --> 21:45.972
Oh, I think so.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.474
I shot him

21:46.513 --> 21:48.474
with this thing nine times

21:48.515 --> 21:50.226
and it crawled

21:48.515 --> 21:50.226
under a bush to die.

21:51.018 --> 21:54.438
I don't think that creature

21:51.018 --> 21:54.438
will bother anyone ever again.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.610
(bike bell dinging)

22:02.989 --> 22:04.198
(strange Squealing)

22:33.351 --> 22:34.312
(oven bell dings)

22:34.352 --> 22:35.521
(man)

22:34.352 --> 22:35.521
Mmm...
