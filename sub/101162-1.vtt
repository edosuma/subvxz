WEBVTT

02:18.931 --> 02:20.332
No, I'm serious.

02:20.365 --> 02:22.068
Can't let them win.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.602
- Okay.
- Don't worry about it.

02:24.203 --> 02:26.939
Why don't you go watch TV, okay?

02:26.973 --> 02:28.007
- Yeah.
- Just relax, go.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.709
- I'll see you for dinner.
- Okay.

02:43.756 --> 02:45.792
Second down
and nine play action.

02:45.825 --> 02:47.660
Morgan gonna crank
up and throw it deep.

02:47.693 --> 02:49.729
Got a man streaking out there.

02:49.762 --> 02:53.065
And it is intercepted
at the 31 yard line.

03:36.608 --> 03:39.912
Next time, Pat, knock
before you come in.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.685
Going
for the end zone.

03:45.718 --> 03:47.119
Touchdown Tulane!

04:13.779 --> 04:14.981
Plus nine
and turnover margin

04:15.014 --> 04:18.117
a year ago, had
17 interceptions.

04:18.149 --> 04:21.754
As we update you on the
American conference scoreboard.

04:25.157 --> 04:26.859
There he
goes off to the races,

04:26.893 --> 04:28.593
sprints down the sideline...

04:37.236 --> 04:38.804
Um, you scared me.

04:40.172 --> 04:40.907
Where is everyone?

04:41.874 --> 04:42.708
They're here.

04:44.877 --> 04:45.745
Where's Mom?

04:49.248 --> 04:50.182
She's over there.

05:13.773 --> 05:15.473
Dear
Pastor Revingol,

05:16.608 --> 05:19.845
I'm very sorry to add this
additional burden to your work.

05:20.947 --> 05:24.717
I left myself in the hands
of God's justice and mercy,

05:25.184 --> 05:28.020
but apparently he saw
fit to ignore my prayers.

05:29.722 --> 05:30.923
What I have done
is for the best,

05:30.957 --> 05:33.491
as far as the children's
souls are concerned.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.695
I know that many will look

05:35.728 --> 05:38.197
at the additional years
they could've lived,

05:38.230 --> 05:40.967
but if they were no
longer servants of God,

05:41.000 --> 05:42.201
what would be gained?

05:44.103 --> 05:45.570
I'm sure many will say

05:45.603 --> 05:48.040
"How could anyone do
such a horrible thing?"

05:49.275 --> 05:52.244
My only answer is
"it wasn't easy."

05:53.611 --> 05:55.748
This was only done
after much thought.

05:57.149 --> 06:00.052
If we were just dealing
with one issue alone,

06:00.086 --> 06:01.654
we may have pulled through.

06:02.620 --> 06:06.759
But considering everything,
it was all just too much.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.863
At least I'm certain that all
of them are in heaven now.

06:11.897 --> 06:15.067
I know that nothing I can
say will make it right,

06:15.101 --> 06:17.236
but I am assured of
making peace with God

06:17.269 --> 06:19.972
because of Christ's sacrifice.

06:20.006 --> 06:21.606
Even for people like me.

06:22.607 --> 06:24.677
Kind regards, John.

06:25.911 --> 06:30.182
P.S. Mother is in
the bedroom upstairs.

06:30.216 --> 06:31.817
She was too heavy to move.

10:33.459 --> 10:34.827
Steph, what are you doin'?

10:35.194 --> 10:36.362
You're supposed to be resting.

10:36.395 --> 10:37.396
I'm bored up there.

10:38.130 --> 10:39.565
Steph, it's only
been three days.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.500
You're gonna be
resting for six weeks.

10:41.533 --> 10:44.103
If I don't lose my
mind before then.

10:47.139 --> 10:48.474
I got it, Dad, it's fine.

10:49.875 --> 10:52.344
All right, um, do
you want some eggs?

10:53.212 --> 10:54.146
No, I'll have cereal.

10:55.514 --> 10:57.816
Cereal, okay...

10:57.850 --> 10:59.418
- I can get it.
- No, it's all right.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.086
You... yeah.

11:01.287 --> 11:02.021
Um.

11:06.925 --> 11:07.926
Spoon.

11:11.497 --> 11:12.498
Thank you.

11:15.901 --> 11:16.935
Shit, uh...

11:19.571 --> 11:20.906
So you're bored, huh?

11:22.474 --> 11:24.310
That's an understatement.

11:24.343 --> 11:25.177
Yeah.

11:26.879 --> 11:28.080
I know it's tough.

11:31.317 --> 11:32.151
But, uh...

11:34.153 --> 11:36.055
Remember what your
mother used to say.

11:40.192 --> 11:41.560
Everything happens for a reason.

11:49.435 --> 11:53.272
Well I gotta go to work soon,
but if you need anything...

11:53.305 --> 11:54.973
I'll be okay.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.975
Danny and Melissa are
coming over later.

11:59.011 --> 11:59.611
Oh.

12:02.548 --> 12:06.452
Um, look, I gotta go to work.

12:06.485 --> 12:10.322
Look, you have the
eggs, all right?

12:11.523 --> 12:13.492
Here, eat that. Alright?

12:13.525 --> 12:14.526
I gotta go. I gotta go.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.461
Ok.

12:15.494 --> 12:16.962
Talk to you later.

12:18.330 --> 12:19.098
Bye sweetie.

12:44.523 --> 12:47.459
â™ª In my heart â™ª

12:51.964 --> 12:54.199
Bob, breakfast ready!

13:21.360 --> 13:23.295
America
needs a tidal wave

13:23.328 --> 13:25.397
of the old-time religion.

13:25.431 --> 13:27.700
America needs to be taken
down to God's bath house

13:27.734 --> 13:30.269
and the hose turned on her,

13:30.302 --> 13:32.137
and the time isn't far distant

13:32.171 --> 13:33.338
when the wheels
of God's judgment

13:33.372 --> 13:37.242
are going to go sweeping through
this old God-hating world.

13:37.276 --> 13:38.410
I want to take a pledge

13:38.444 --> 13:40.713
and this audience to
join me in a pledge

13:40.747 --> 13:44.116
that you will never rest
until this old God-hating,

13:44.149 --> 13:47.085
Christ-hating, whisky-soaked,
Sabbath-breaking,

13:47.119 --> 13:51.023
blaspheming, infidel,
bootlegging old world

13:51.056 --> 13:53.158
is bound to the
cross of Jesus Christ

13:53.192 --> 13:55.160
by the golden chains of love.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.111
- Thanks, honey.
- You're welcome.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.689
Bless us, O Lord,
as we give thanks

14:22.722 --> 14:25.390
for these gifts from Thy bounty.

14:25.424 --> 14:26.391
- Amen.

14:49.548 --> 14:50.415
What the hell did
you do all day?

14:50.449 --> 14:51.651
Just watch TV?

14:52.017 --> 14:53.452
I got so bored of that

14:53.485 --> 14:56.555
I actually started
watching the neighbors.

14:56.588 --> 14:59.491
I never knew you
were into voyeurism.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.393
- Good to know.
- Not like that.

15:02.528 --> 15:03.730
If you watch people
for long enough,

15:03.763 --> 15:07.533
you realize their lives
run like clockwork.

15:07.566 --> 15:09.736
They leave the house the
same time every morning,

15:09.769 --> 15:12.204
mow the lawn every Saturday.

15:12.237 --> 15:14.406
Such a routine existence.

15:14.439 --> 15:15.775
Housebound for less than a week,

15:15.808 --> 15:18.477
and you're already having
an existential crisis.

15:18.510 --> 15:19.812
Maybe I am.

15:19.846 --> 15:22.481
Don't the neighbors ever
do anything exciting?

15:22.514 --> 15:24.149
I wouldn't say exciting.

15:24.182 --> 15:26.251
Sometimes they do stuff
that's kind of funny.

15:26.285 --> 15:27.419
Like what?

15:27.452 --> 15:29.421
Like poor Mrs.
Corbits at number 11

15:29.454 --> 15:31.791
looks like she's having
a party every night.

15:31.824 --> 15:34.459
Lights keep flashing on
and off the whole time.

15:34.493 --> 15:36.128
Then I realized
what was going on.

15:36.161 --> 15:38.665
They have one of those clap-on
clap-off lights installed.

15:39.032 --> 15:40.232
Oh yeah, "The Clapper."

15:40.265 --> 15:41.433
I've seen that on TV.

15:42.001 --> 15:43.770
Why would she be
clapping constantly?

15:44.469 --> 15:48.140
I wondered that, then my Dad
told me she has Tourette's.

15:49.608 --> 15:54.313
Wait, so you're telling that
the lights go on and off

15:54.346 --> 15:55.715
when you say fuck too?

15:55.748 --> 15:58.317
No, Tourette's doesn't
just cause cursing.

15:58.350 --> 16:00.452
You get physical tics.

16:00.485 --> 16:03.455
One of Mrs. Corbits' tics
is that she slaps her leg,

16:03.488 --> 16:06.224
so every time she does
that, the lights go off,

16:06.258 --> 16:08.560
so she has to clap to
get them back on again.

16:12.297 --> 16:13.265
- Guys, it's not funny.
- Yes it is!

16:13.298 --> 16:15.868
- It's a serious condition.
- That's terrible!

16:17.603 --> 16:19.806
Also it's creepy you're
just watching her.

16:22.541 --> 16:23.542
It's a little funny.

16:30.349 --> 16:32.584
It's been 18 years.

16:32.618 --> 16:35.287
No one can say that we
haven't given this ample time.

16:36.656 --> 16:39.626
Let's give back the task
force to you and Wayne Harris.

16:39.659 --> 16:43.462
Now Wayne is retired, it's time
you closed this chapter too.

16:44.631 --> 16:46.465
I can't justify
any more manpower

16:46.498 --> 16:48.533
on a case that's
colder than Alaska.

16:48.567 --> 16:51.804
So what do you
suggest I do, sir?

16:51.838 --> 16:54.606
Stop taking this case
so personally, move on.

16:55.407 --> 16:58.510
If you've seen what
he did to that family,

16:58.543 --> 17:00.545
what he done to those kids...

17:00.579 --> 17:02.447
Listen, you got a lotta cases

17:02.481 --> 17:04.884
in the "win" column
over the years.

17:04.916 --> 17:07.319
This is a rare one
that got away from you.

17:07.352 --> 17:08.487
You gotta accept that.

17:09.689 --> 17:10.923
It's time to let it go.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.334
He's got a point.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.671
You took that case
too personally.

17:24.704 --> 17:26.204
Come on, Wayne.

17:26.238 --> 17:28.607
We worked our asses off,
and he still got away.

17:29.374 --> 17:31.510
Motherfucker made a
fool out of all of us.

17:32.244 --> 17:34.513
Is that what really
stings, Frank?

17:34.546 --> 17:35.948
That your ego took a dent?

17:39.251 --> 17:40.252
Well maybe it did.

17:41.286 --> 17:43.588
Come on, you saw
the crime scene.

17:43.622 --> 17:46.959
A guy could do that to his
own blood, running free?

17:48.593 --> 17:50.663
I take it you're not gonna
heed the Chief's advice.

17:50.697 --> 17:51.731
No.

17:51.764 --> 17:54.433
But now he's pulled the
plug I gotta go it alone.

17:54.466 --> 17:56.601
The first thing's the press.

17:56.636 --> 18:00.605
Nationally syndicated
magazines, newspapers.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.506
Maybe I can get someone

18:01.540 --> 18:02.742
interested in doing
a follow-up story.

18:03.142 --> 18:04.944
Nearly 20 years later?

18:04.977 --> 18:06.378
Come on, Frank.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.649
We don't even know if
he's still in the country.

18:09.682 --> 18:11.550
- He is.
- How can you be so sure?

18:13.385 --> 18:14.721
Everybody we spoke to about List

18:14.754 --> 18:17.824
told us he was a cheerleader
for the American dream.

18:18.157 --> 18:21.426
Marriage, suburbia, church.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.395
He lived for that shit.

18:23.428 --> 18:27.532
And nobody has Christian
family values like Uncle Sam.

19:56.789 --> 19:57.622
Yeah?

20:08.768 --> 20:09.601
Thank you.

20:11.871 --> 20:14.573
Never realized the neighbors
were so interesting.

20:16.042 --> 20:18.744
Look over there, the
garden of number 10.

20:24.016 --> 20:26.018
What am I supposed
to be looking at here?

20:26.052 --> 20:27.787
There's a guy mowing his lawn.

20:27.820 --> 20:28.721
Yeah, in a suit.

20:28.754 --> 20:30.890
Who mows their lawn
in a shirt and tie?

20:31.590 --> 20:33.558
It's a little weird, I guess.

20:34.694 --> 20:36.361
Do you know much about that guy?

20:37.930 --> 20:38.731
Bob Clark?

20:40.166 --> 20:41.734
We said hello from time to time.

20:42.869 --> 20:44.569
Can't say I've
spoken to him much.

20:45.604 --> 20:48.741
I've had a few conversations
with his wife, Dolores.

20:48.774 --> 20:49.876
She seems nice.

20:50.408 --> 20:51.610
I've never really
noticed him before,

20:51.644 --> 20:55.715
but last night, he was watching
me from the upstairs window.

20:56.883 --> 20:58.150
Really?

20:58.184 --> 21:00.019
Yeah, it was kinda creepy.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.156
You weren't lookin' through

21:04.190 --> 21:06.659
the binoculars at
the time, were you?

21:07.927 --> 21:08.761
I might've been.

21:10.730 --> 21:11.864
Oh Christ, Steph.

21:13.132 --> 21:14.499
You really need to
find something better

21:14.532 --> 21:15.600
to do with your time.

21:18.638 --> 21:20.605
Why don't you read
a book or somethin'?

21:40.893 --> 21:42.560
<i>After the murders,</i>

21:42.594 --> 21:44.730
<i>List cut himself out of every
photograph in the house.</i>

21:45.331 --> 21:46.332
<i>We discovered he'd lost his job</i>

21:46.365 --> 21:48.768
<i>at the Jersey City Bank
a few weeks before.</i>

21:49.635 --> 21:50.468
<i>We're pretty sure
he never shared</i>

21:50.502 --> 21:51.469
<i>this information
with his family.</i>

21:51.503 --> 21:53.471
He'd skim money from his
mother's bank account

21:53.505 --> 21:55.808
to avoid defaulting
on the mortgage.

21:55.841 --> 21:57.944
He emptied what was left
on the day of the killings

21:57.977 --> 21:59.879
and that's what he
used to relocate.

22:57.670 --> 22:59.305
<i>Good evening.</i>

22:59.338 --> 23:00.873
<i>In view of the difficult events</i>

23:00.906 --> 23:02.008
<i>that we cover here on this show,</i>

23:02.041 --> 23:05.878
I'm delighted to start tonight
with some positive news.

23:05.911 --> 23:09.081
Rapist and murderer
David James Roberts

23:09.115 --> 23:13.085
is behind bars because
of you, the viewers.

23:13.119 --> 23:15.988
<i>Our regulars will remember
that we profiled Roberts</i>

23:16.022 --> 23:17.223
<i>on the show last week,</i>

23:17.256 --> 23:20.659
<i>and he's considered one of
America's most wanted criminals.</i>

23:21.894 --> 23:24.797
<i>Roberts murdered a man by
the name of Bill Patrick,</i>

23:24.830 --> 23:27.666
<i>his wife, and their child.</i>

23:27.700 --> 23:31.103
<i>He also raped the mother and
killed her six month old son.</i>

23:41.947 --> 23:43.282
- Yeah?
- Frank?

23:45.017 --> 23:45.918
Turn on channel five.

23:51.023 --> 23:52.624
<i>For two years...</i>

23:53.859 --> 23:55.795
What am I looking at?

23:55.828 --> 23:57.997
It's a new TV show.

23:58.030 --> 23:58.964
They profile
fugitives on the run

23:58.998 --> 24:00.966
and then ask viewers
to call in with tips.

24:03.202 --> 24:04.804
This shit actually works?

24:04.837 --> 24:07.039
The host said some guy
on the run for two years

24:07.073 --> 24:09.775
was arrested after 75
callers identified him.

24:12.645 --> 24:14.146
Well, all right.

24:14.180 --> 24:15.881
Let me check it out, I'll
give you a call back.

24:16.415 --> 24:17.149
Okay.

24:20.086 --> 24:22.121
<i>He's been called
the Green River Killer</i>

24:22.154 --> 24:24.690
<i>ever since the first
bodies, five of them,</i>

24:24.723 --> 24:25.925
<i>were pulled from this river.</i>

25:10.236 --> 25:11.937
What are you doing in our house?

25:13.005 --> 25:16.809
Um, Steph, this is Mr. Clark.

25:16.842 --> 25:19.178
He's come over to apologize.

25:19.211 --> 25:20.980
I startled her again.

25:21.013 --> 25:23.249
I seem to be making a
habit of that today.

25:24.116 --> 25:25.417
Stephanie, I'm Bob.

25:28.888 --> 25:30.656
Feel I owe you an explanation.

25:31.557 --> 25:34.093
Mrs. Atherton next
door goes to my church.

25:34.126 --> 25:35.027
She mentioned on Sunday

25:35.060 --> 25:37.463
that she had some
vermin on her property,

25:37.496 --> 25:39.131
so I offered to get
rid of it for her.

25:39.465 --> 25:40.432
With a gun?

25:40.466 --> 25:42.768
Isn't that a little excessive?

25:42.801 --> 25:45.404
So focused on trying to do
a good deed for a neighbor,

25:45.437 --> 25:48.140
and it just didn't occur to me.

25:49.508 --> 25:51.911
But afterwards, when I saw you,

25:51.944 --> 25:54.079
I realized how scary
it may have been.

25:56.048 --> 25:58.684
The last thing I wanna do
is frighten a neighbor.

26:03.088 --> 26:04.089
Goddamn rats!

26:10.095 --> 26:12.498
Well, Bob, I really appreciate

26:12.531 --> 26:15.701
you comin' over to address this.

26:17.136 --> 26:19.405
I just hope that Stephanie
will accept my apology.

26:22.341 --> 26:23.175
Yeah, sure.

26:26.111 --> 26:27.179
Bless your heart.

26:28.214 --> 26:30.816
As it says in Ephesians 4:31,

26:30.849 --> 26:34.053
"Be kind and compassionate,
forgiving each other

26:34.086 --> 26:37.156
"just as through Christ,
God forgave you."

26:42.428 --> 26:45.097
Anyway, I've taken up too
much of your time already.

26:45.130 --> 26:47.499
Thank you both for
your hospitality.

26:49.268 --> 26:52.037
Hopefully we'll be seeing more
of each other in the future.

26:58.210 --> 27:00.379
Yeah, well, um...

27:00.412 --> 27:03.782
Thanks again Bob for
comin' over to...

27:04.917 --> 27:08.053
Yeah, address that, I'll see
you out to the front door.

27:17.296 --> 27:19.098
A Bible-basher with a gun!

27:19.131 --> 27:21.066
God, I love this country.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.034
Look.

27:24.203 --> 27:25.337
What's this?

27:25.371 --> 27:29.108
Some guy in New Jersey killed
his family 18 years ago.

27:32.511 --> 27:34.413
Light reading, huh, Steph?

27:34.748 --> 27:37.883
This guy looks just
like Bob Clark.

27:41.053 --> 27:43.188
Oh, Steph.

27:43.222 --> 27:44.990
Check out the eyes, it's him!

27:46.425 --> 27:50.863
Look kinda similar, but I
don't think it's the same guy.

27:52.998 --> 27:56.135
You'll at least admit he's a
total weirdo though, right?

27:56.168 --> 27:58.003
Well, I felt we were
two seconds away

27:58.037 --> 27:59.204
from him selling us
a watchtower,

27:59.238 --> 28:00.472
but that hardly qualifies him

28:00.506 --> 28:04.543
as somebody who would
murder his own family!

28:04.576 --> 28:06.545
Dad, that's him.

28:06.578 --> 28:09.248
Steph, oh Steph!

28:10.449 --> 28:12.451
Why can't you read
somethin' else?

28:17.289 --> 28:18.891
I've never seen the guy before.

28:18.924 --> 28:20.893
How am I supposed to
know if that's him?

28:25.297 --> 28:27.599
Oh my God, you're taking
pictures of him too?

28:27.634 --> 28:29.201
Stalking much?

28:29.234 --> 28:31.570
Well this isn't helping, Steph!

28:31.603 --> 28:33.572
Looks like you took
these from space.

28:33.605 --> 28:35.207
Yeah, I couldn't
exactly go up to him

28:35.240 --> 28:37.309
and ask for a close-up, could I?

28:38.010 --> 28:39.978
You gonna
call the cops, Steph?

28:40.012 --> 28:42.848
Not yet, I need some actual
proof that it is him.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.351
How do you
plan to get that?

28:45.384 --> 28:47.986
Not sure yet, but I'll
think of something.

28:48.020 --> 28:52.524
All right, well I
gotta head to practice.

28:52.558 --> 28:53.258
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:54.093 --> 28:54.893
'Kay.

28:55.561 --> 28:56.228
See ya.

29:02.334 --> 29:04.103
Hey, can you hand
me that pencil?

29:05.437 --> 29:06.271
Sure.

29:10.275 --> 29:11.310
Oh my God, that's good.

29:12.344 --> 29:13.178
Ugh.

29:21.654 --> 29:24.123
Oh, hey Mr. Hancock.

29:24.156 --> 29:26.325
Hey Danny, how's it goin'?

29:27.292 --> 29:28.193
Not bad.

29:33.298 --> 29:35.601
You still workin'
at the pizza parlor?

29:35.635 --> 29:36.468
Yep.

29:38.671 --> 29:42.508
How's the football going?

29:42.541 --> 29:44.143
Pretty good actually.

29:45.077 --> 29:47.246
We're third in the state
at the minute, so...

29:48.380 --> 29:49.281
Yeah.

29:51.316 --> 29:53.352
You plannin' on makin'
a livin' from that?

29:55.354 --> 29:59.659
Well, I play for the love of
it, to be honest with you.

30:00.359 --> 30:02.394
But there's some
big-league scouts

30:02.428 --> 30:05.564
who come from time to
time, so you never know!

30:17.276 --> 30:18.143
Reassuring.

30:20.112 --> 30:20.914
Thanks.

30:30.055 --> 30:31.123
<i>I wanna be left alone!</i>

30:32.024 --> 30:33.626
<i>Can't they leave me alone?</i>

30:57.416 --> 31:00.052
I just wanna be left alone.

31:00.085 --> 31:01.320
Can they leave me alone?

31:02.054 --> 31:03.723
Why don't they
just leave me alone?

31:18.237 --> 31:20.339
You are gonna keep it together.

31:20.372 --> 31:21.340
You hear me?

31:30.717 --> 31:33.285
<i>More bodies
have been discovered nearby,</i>

31:33.318 --> 31:35.087
<i>all those of young
prostitutes...</i>

31:35.287 --> 31:38.023
Look Bob, what do you think?

31:39.491 --> 31:40.425
New dress?

31:40.459 --> 31:42.427
Yeah, isn't it beautiful?

31:43.595 --> 31:45.163
How much did it cost?

31:45.197 --> 31:47.399
I got it on sale for 30 bucks.

31:48.367 --> 31:49.368
That's a little steep.

31:51.638 --> 31:53.472
Is this for the church benefit?

31:53.505 --> 31:54.306
Yeah.

31:55.407 --> 31:56.743
It's a little figure-hugging.

31:58.477 --> 32:00.512
Don't I have a nice figure?

32:00.546 --> 32:02.514
But is it appropriate
for the pastor

32:02.548 --> 32:03.750
and congregation to see it?

32:05.785 --> 32:08.620
I don't think it's
inappropriate.

32:08.655 --> 32:10.489
I think I look nice.

32:23.736 --> 32:26.538
You know I love you, don't you?

32:26.572 --> 32:27.406
Yes.

32:28.875 --> 32:29.742
Do you love me?

32:30.576 --> 32:31.844
Of course I do.

32:33.445 --> 32:36.816
Then please respect my wishes.

32:37.784 --> 32:41.153
Find a more modest dress
for the benefit, okay?

32:46.491 --> 32:47.292
Fine.

32:47.894 --> 32:48.861
Thank you.

32:58.738 --> 33:00.372
What was he doing?

33:00.405 --> 33:02.809
I dunno, he was
kinda freaking out.

33:02.842 --> 33:06.511
He was pacing back and
forth, agitated as hell.

33:06.545 --> 33:08.380
Then he threw a magazine
across the room.

33:08.413 --> 33:09.247
That magazine?

33:10.349 --> 33:11.583
I dunno, I couldn't
really see it.

33:11.617 --> 33:14.787
But he seemed
pretty mad about it.

33:15.253 --> 33:18.390
He must have seen it when I
dropped it in the kitchen.

33:18.423 --> 33:19.424
Gone and bought a copy.

33:20.192 --> 33:23.595
We don't know anything
for sure, you know?

33:23.630 --> 33:24.529
I mean, think about it.

33:24.563 --> 33:25.564
If we took this to the cops,

33:25.597 --> 33:27.299
they'd say that the
evidence was pretty thin.

33:27.332 --> 33:28.500
I know that.

33:35.540 --> 33:36.375
Oh, God.

33:37.376 --> 33:38.210
What?

33:39.411 --> 33:40.647
You got that look.

33:40.880 --> 33:41.714
What look?

33:42.081 --> 33:43.615
You know, that look you get
when you're gonna ask me

33:43.650 --> 33:46.351
to do something that
I don't wanna do.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.921
Every Sunday, Clark and
his wife go to church.

33:48.955 --> 33:49.922
Yeah.

33:49.956 --> 33:52.391
They're out of the house
for like three hours.

33:52.424 --> 33:55.360
They leave at 8:30 and
come back around midday.

33:55.394 --> 33:57.596
Oh no, Steph.

33:57.630 --> 33:59.464
I am not breaking
into his house.

34:00.532 --> 34:01.500
I didn't ask you to.

34:01.533 --> 34:03.335
I didn't say anything.

34:03.368 --> 34:04.302
Okay.

34:05.270 --> 34:06.338
What do you want me to do?

34:08.507 --> 34:09.608
Break into his house.

34:09.641 --> 34:12.476
I knew it, I knew it!

34:13.112 --> 34:15.313
You know breaking and
entering is a felony, right?

34:15.347 --> 34:16.547
I could go to jail.

34:16.581 --> 34:18.784
You wouldn't have to
actually break in.

34:18.818 --> 34:20.920
His wife leaves the spare
key under a plant pot

34:20.953 --> 34:22.521
next to the front door.

34:22.554 --> 34:24.991
Okay, so if...

34:25.024 --> 34:26.859
<i>If</i> I do this...

34:28.260 --> 34:29.929
What am I supposed
to be looking for?

34:29.962 --> 34:33.231
Any evidence that proves
Clark is John List.

34:33.264 --> 34:35.333
Oh, come on Steph.

34:35.367 --> 34:37.335
You really think he's gonna
keep incriminating shit

34:37.369 --> 34:39.304
lying around all
these years later?

34:39.337 --> 34:42.306
No, but there might
be an older photo.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.309
If we had a picture with
a clear resemblance,

34:44.342 --> 34:45.610
it would help convince the cops.

34:46.746 --> 34:48.246
Yeah, but...

34:48.280 --> 34:50.315
How are we gonna
explain how we got it?

34:50.348 --> 34:51.717
I mean, surely the
cops are gonna know

34:51.751 --> 34:53.618
that I broke into his house.

34:53.652 --> 34:55.655
What are they gonna
care more about?

34:55.688 --> 34:56.723
Busting you for stealing a photo

34:56.755 --> 34:59.892
or catching some guy who
murdered his whole family?

35:03.896 --> 35:05.698
I can't believe
I'm gonna do this.

35:06.766 --> 35:07.700
I must be crazy.

35:15.842 --> 35:17.375
Thanks for meeting me
today, Miss Phillips.

35:17.409 --> 35:18.745
I know you're very busy.

35:18.778 --> 35:20.780
Please, call me Ellen.

35:21.681 --> 35:23.482
Ellen.

35:23.515 --> 35:26.753
The show you produce,
it's intriguing.

35:26.786 --> 35:28.587
Never seen anything
quite like it before.

35:28.620 --> 35:31.057
Well, I brought
it to the network.

35:31.090 --> 35:34.392
But it's really John
Wesley's brainchild.

35:34.426 --> 35:36.428
You heard what happened
to his kid, right?

35:36.863 --> 35:38.563
He was murdered, wasn't he?

35:38.865 --> 35:41.366
That's right, his young son.

35:42.702 --> 35:44.737
John noticed, when
dealing with the media,

35:44.771 --> 35:47.707
how quickly they could
get information out there.

35:47.740 --> 35:50.910
The TV coverage helped
catch his son's killer.

35:52.078 --> 35:53.478
If it's used in the right way,

35:53.512 --> 35:55.447
the media can be
a powerful weapon.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.314
It can.

35:57.150 --> 35:58.718
Of course, if I'm being
honest, I've gotta admit

35:58.751 --> 36:01.687
the media's motives
are hardly noble.

36:03.089 --> 36:05.992
Everyone who works in
this business understands,

36:06.025 --> 36:08.560
if it bleeds, it leads.

36:09.494 --> 36:13.565
Why do you think people are
so fascinated by murder?

36:15.968 --> 36:18.638
Killers tantalize people.

36:19.437 --> 36:23.441
Like traffic accidents
or natural disasters.

36:24.977 --> 36:29.048
The actions of a
killer are horrible,

36:29.081 --> 36:31.316
but the public just
can't look away.

36:32.417 --> 36:33.686
So, did you get a chance

36:33.719 --> 36:35.922
to have a look over the
details of the List case?

36:36.521 --> 36:37.556
I did.

36:37.589 --> 36:39.558
And will you consider
featuring it on the show?

36:40.592 --> 36:42.427
It's the kind of taboo crime

36:42.460 --> 36:45.898
that intrigues and
horrifies people.

36:48.067 --> 36:52.604
But the problem is it
took place so long ago.

36:52.638 --> 36:56.108
You have one picture
that's over 20 years old.

36:56.142 --> 36:59.511
The guy probably looks
very different now.

37:00.612 --> 37:02.148
I'd have to question
whether or not

37:02.181 --> 37:06.618
we'd get the audience
response we need

37:06.652 --> 37:08.120
to make an identification.

37:09.989 --> 37:11.991
But it's worth a shot, isn't it?

37:12.024 --> 37:15.427
I don't think the
network is going to want

37:15.460 --> 37:19.999
to blot our copy book
by featuring cases

37:20.032 --> 37:24.804
which are unlikely to
have a positive outcome.

37:25.905 --> 37:26.939
So what are you saying?

37:28.506 --> 37:30.810
I'm saying it's a
"pass" for now.

37:31.677 --> 37:35.915
But if you get any
additional information

37:35.948 --> 37:39.118
that could improve the
chances of an identification,

37:40.786 --> 37:44.857
then we'll certainly consider
it for future broadcast.

38:08.881 --> 38:09.882
It's time.

44:08.307 --> 44:10.109
Thanks Leslie, all
right, have a good night.

44:10.142 --> 44:11.443
- Mr. Wesley?
- Yes?

44:11.477 --> 44:12.544
Detective Frank Clayton, sir.

44:12.578 --> 44:13.979
Do you have a minute?

44:14.013 --> 44:15.481
Yeah, how can I
help you Detective?

44:15.514 --> 44:17.149
I spoke to your
producer Ellen Phillips.

44:17.182 --> 44:19.151
I'm trying to get a case
featured on the show.

44:19.518 --> 44:20.919
Well, if you go
through her channels,

44:20.953 --> 44:22.488
she's gonna arrange
that for you.

44:22.521 --> 44:24.156
Oh no, she rejected it, sir.

44:24.189 --> 44:25.057
Well I'm sorry to hear that.

44:25.090 --> 44:26.358
We have a rather
full plate right now.

44:26.392 --> 44:27.559
We can't feature everybody,

44:27.593 --> 44:29.194
but perhaps some
time in the future.

44:29.228 --> 44:31.196
Well you see, time is
a factor here, sir.

44:31.230 --> 44:34.300
Look, Detective, that's
just the way it works here.

44:34.333 --> 44:37.102
We have to go through
the channels, you know?

44:38.170 --> 44:39.905
I know what happened
to your son.

44:42.508 --> 44:47.112
Yeah, well, it's a matter of
public record, unfortunately.

44:48.047 --> 44:51.250
John List murdered both
of his sons in cold blood.

44:52.918 --> 44:55.120
Frederick, John Junior.

44:56.588 --> 44:58.090
They were 13 and 15.

44:59.958 --> 45:00.959
His daughter, too.

45:02.161 --> 45:02.995
Tricia.

45:04.096 --> 45:04.963
She was 16.

45:08.267 --> 45:11.603
I've been working this case
for nearly two decades now.

45:11.638 --> 45:13.038
Our department shut me down

45:13.072 --> 45:15.274
and I'm having to do
it on my own time.

45:16.942 --> 45:20.012
All because I am still
haunted by that crime scene.

45:21.413 --> 45:26.151
Three beautiful children
snuffed out by a man

45:26.185 --> 45:28.187
who's supposed to
love and protect them.

45:31.223 --> 45:33.025
They deserve
justice, Mr. Wesley.

45:34.927 --> 45:37.029
Come on, looks like
you can use a drink.

45:41.600 --> 45:44.002
It was July back in '81.

45:44.970 --> 45:47.206
Aaron was our first and
only son at the time.

45:49.041 --> 45:51.877
My wife Deborah and I were
living the American dream.

45:52.878 --> 45:56.081
Had a great job in real
estate, beautiful home.

45:57.182 --> 45:59.017
Deborah always wanted
to be a mother,

45:59.051 --> 46:00.185
so when Aaron came along,

46:01.553 --> 46:02.955
our lives were complete.

46:05.591 --> 46:09.361
And one day we were in a
department store, browsing.

46:09.395 --> 46:10.496
Aaron was with us.

46:12.699 --> 46:14.233
Laughing, running in and out

46:14.266 --> 46:15.901
of the aisles like
he always did.

46:17.069 --> 46:19.371
Couldn't have turned our back
on him for more than a minute,

46:19.405 --> 46:20.239
he was gone.

46:22.441 --> 46:24.576
Knowing that he was out there,

46:24.610 --> 46:26.912
alone, frightened, without us...

46:27.680 --> 46:29.248
I felt so helpless.

46:35.521 --> 46:38.123
Two weeks later they
found his body in a river.

46:39.726 --> 46:42.961
Opportunist abduction, murder.

46:46.766 --> 46:49.636
And our lives completely
changed in a matter of minutes.

46:52.070 --> 46:54.039
The day they found Aaron's body,

46:55.240 --> 46:57.342
my heart broke into
a million pieces.

47:00.379 --> 47:02.347
Years later I'm still trying
to put it back together.

47:03.482 --> 47:04.283
I'm sorry.

47:05.217 --> 47:07.286
I think what hurt
even more was the fact

47:07.319 --> 47:08.987
that the local
police department's

47:09.021 --> 47:11.190
response was so poor.

47:11.223 --> 47:13.392
I mean, with all due
respect to you, Detective,

47:14.359 --> 47:16.495
they didn't know their
head from their ass.

47:18.163 --> 47:21.400
I can only imagine if they'd
been a little bit more decisive

47:21.433 --> 47:24.102
we could've found Aaron before
that animal took his life.

47:25.370 --> 47:27.506
Well, if it had come
to my department,

47:27.539 --> 47:29.308
it would've been
a different story.

47:30.442 --> 47:32.344
Yeah, I appreciate that.

47:32.377 --> 47:34.046
But when the media got involved,

47:34.079 --> 47:39.084
I realized that we could
create this wide awareness.

47:40.519 --> 47:42.488
It also restored my
faith in human nature

47:42.521 --> 47:43.690
at a very dark time.

47:45.424 --> 47:49.094
We received over 40,000 letters
from all over the country.

47:50.329 --> 47:54.032
People wishing us
well, sympathizing,

47:54.066 --> 47:55.501
sharing their own stories.

47:56.468 --> 47:59.438
And I knew that if I could
get information out there

47:59.471 --> 48:02.474
on a national scale and
galvanize the public

48:02.508 --> 48:06.178
into being directly involved
with finding those criminals,

48:07.479 --> 48:08.413
we could solve cases

48:08.447 --> 48:11.383
that would generally
never stand a chance.

48:11.416 --> 48:13.418
This is why I came
to you, Mr. Wesley.

48:14.854 --> 48:16.723
I don't share a bloodline
with the List children,

48:16.756 --> 48:21.694
but in death, I've got
to know them so well.

48:23.295 --> 48:25.397
I talked to everybody
about Frederick

48:25.430 --> 48:27.299
and John Junior and Patricia.

48:28.635 --> 48:31.537
I learned about all
the things they loved.

48:31.570 --> 48:34.373
Their dreams, aspirations.

48:37.543 --> 48:40.112
If I'd have caught List,
then there'd be closure.

48:41.046 --> 48:43.615
But as long as he's still out
there, this'll never be over.

48:44.851 --> 48:46.753
Those children will
never be at peace.

48:47.787 --> 48:48.620
I know.

48:49.822 --> 48:51.824
Took us years to find
Aaron's murderer.

48:54.727 --> 48:56.361
Closure is important.

48:56.729 --> 48:57.697
It really is.

48:58.898 --> 49:00.667
I've been chasing
it for 18 years.

49:03.235 --> 49:07.506
Look, Frank, I can't
promise anything.

49:07.539 --> 49:09.374
I'm usually a servant
to the network

49:09.408 --> 49:10.777
in these kind of things, but...

49:13.913 --> 49:15.147
I'll do my best.

49:16.481 --> 49:18.083
Try and get you on the show.

49:19.886 --> 49:20.787
Thank you, John.

49:22.621 --> 49:23.522
I appreciate that.

49:38.570 --> 49:40.405
So what do you wanna do next?

49:40.707 --> 49:41.540
I don't know.

49:42.608 --> 49:44.309
Well, one thing's for sure,

49:44.343 --> 49:46.746
I'm not sneaking around
his house anymore.

49:46.779 --> 49:48.146
It's too risky.

49:48.648 --> 49:49.481
I know.

49:51.516 --> 49:52.351
I'm so sorry.

49:53.585 --> 49:54.419
I'll live.

49:56.455 --> 49:58.691
Maybe I should
just call the cops.

49:58.725 --> 50:01.493
At least then that would
shine a spotlight on him.

50:01.526 --> 50:02.895
Maybe his ID's don't check out.

50:02.929 --> 50:04.764
They'll discover
who he really is.

50:04.964 --> 50:06.899
And if we're wrong,
they'll bust us

50:06.933 --> 50:08.433
for wasting police time.

50:10.369 --> 50:11.904
You don't still
have doubts, do you?

50:13.673 --> 50:14.506
I don't know.

50:19.646 --> 50:21.480
We're gonna need more
than just suspicion

50:21.513 --> 50:22.614
before we call the cops.

50:22.649 --> 50:24.583
I know, we've been through this.

50:32.224 --> 50:33.358
Look, I'm gonna go home.

50:33.392 --> 50:34.426
I'm pretty tired.

50:35.327 --> 50:35.928
Okay.

50:38.430 --> 50:39.564
You coming by tomorrow?

50:40.767 --> 50:41.566
Sure.

51:17.335 --> 51:19.337
Goddamn it!

51:19.371 --> 51:21.808
Profanity isn't
necessary, young man.

51:21.841 --> 51:23.710
What the hell are
you doin' in my car?

51:23.743 --> 51:26.012
I think it's time we
had a little chat.

51:26.045 --> 51:28.748
You needed to break
into my car to do that?

51:28.781 --> 51:30.482
I guess this makes us even.

51:32.785 --> 51:33.720
What do you mean?

51:33.753 --> 51:34.654
The post man.

51:36.022 --> 51:39.025
When I left, he was right
there, on the model.

51:39.058 --> 51:41.426
When I came back he
was on the floor.

51:41.460 --> 51:43.863
Unless this town experienced
its first ever earthquake

51:43.896 --> 51:45.798
while I was out,
it's tough to see

51:45.832 --> 51:47.365
how that could've happened.

51:52.905 --> 51:54.573
I know that you and your
girlfriend Stephanie

51:54.606 --> 51:56.843
have taken quite an
interest in me lately.

51:56.876 --> 51:59.411
- No, no...
- Please.

51:59.444 --> 52:00.747
Let's level with each other.

52:02.715 --> 52:05.550
I don't know why you've
been snooping around.

52:05.584 --> 52:06.719
Maybe I don't want to know.

52:07.787 --> 52:09.521
But let me tell you one thing.

52:10.489 --> 52:13.325
I value my privacy.

52:14.727 --> 52:16.595
As I'm sure you value your own.

52:17.630 --> 52:19.598
We all have a right to it.

52:19.632 --> 52:23.268
I'll respect yours
if you respect mine.

52:24.771 --> 52:26.639
And here's the
point to remember.

52:27.774 --> 52:28.941
You may be watching me...

52:34.814 --> 52:36.414
But I'm also watching you.

53:03.676 --> 53:05.645
Hey Frank, sorry I'm late.

53:05.678 --> 53:07.647
Damn production meeting
ran over, as usual.

53:07.680 --> 53:08.881
Not a problem.

53:08.915 --> 53:10.650
So this is the guy I
was telling you about.

53:10.683 --> 53:11.383
Dave Brenton.

53:11.416 --> 53:12.785
- Good to meet you.
- You too.

53:23.863 --> 53:26.132
So you're a sculptor?

53:26.165 --> 53:30.837
Actually, autodidact
forensic artist.

53:30.870 --> 53:31.771
You'll have to forgive me, Dave.

53:31.804 --> 53:33.840
I'm a little behind the times.

53:33.873 --> 53:35.675
What exactly does
your job entail?

53:35.708 --> 53:38.443
Facial reconstructions
of fugitives

53:38.476 --> 53:40.746
based on outdated pictures.

53:40.780 --> 53:42.380
Aging a sculpted bust

53:42.414 --> 53:45.117
to show how they may
look in the present day.

53:45.151 --> 53:47.854
See Frank, here's
the problem you have.

53:47.887 --> 53:50.857
That photograph that we have
of List is as old as hell.

53:50.890 --> 53:53.425
Viewers need to see
what he looks like today

53:53.458 --> 53:55.560
in order to make a positive ID.

53:55.594 --> 53:57.163
That's where Dave comes in.

53:57.196 --> 53:59.799
He fabricates that
age-progressed bust

53:59.832 --> 54:02.668
so that our viewer gets
a pretty good indication

54:02.702 --> 54:04.469
of what List might
look like today.

54:04.502 --> 54:06.739
Massively improve your
chance of a positive ID.

54:07.673 --> 54:10.176
It sounds terrific,
but we can't be certain

54:10.209 --> 54:11.644
of what List looks like now,

54:11.677 --> 54:13.045
so it's gonna be kinda
speculative, isn't it?

54:13.079 --> 54:15.513
I'll be based on
a lot of research.

54:15.547 --> 54:17.482
I'll create some
various key questions.

54:18.516 --> 54:19.719
Where does he live?

54:19.752 --> 54:21.087
The city, the suburbs?

54:21.120 --> 54:23.189
And what kind of
clothes does he wear?

54:23.222 --> 54:26.893
I think he would wear a pair
of thick dark brown glasses.

54:26.926 --> 54:28.526
Why do you think that?

54:28.560 --> 54:30.062
I think he would wanna
look more astute,

54:30.096 --> 54:32.564
you know, more in control
than he really was.

54:33.598 --> 54:36.035
Well, it could be you've got
the right handle on this guy.

54:39.805 --> 54:41.908
<i>The
disappearance of the daughter,</i>

54:41.941 --> 54:44.609
<i>the Amber Alert
going out for her,</i>

54:44.644 --> 54:47.445
<i>the discovery of her
body in her father's home</i>

54:47.479 --> 54:48.948
<i>and then the arrest of this man.</i>

54:48.981 --> 54:51.017
<i>He was arrested after
somebody had heard...</i>

54:51.050 --> 54:52.752
God, that's awful.

54:54.654 --> 54:55.855
Bob...

54:55.888 --> 54:57.189
What?

54:57.223 --> 54:59.591
You hear that, on the TV?

55:00.760 --> 55:01.994
A father killed
his own daughter.

55:03.796 --> 55:05.430
Isn't that awful?

55:08.868 --> 55:10.435
Yeah, that's...

55:10.770 --> 55:12.038
that's terrible.

55:14.974 --> 55:16.776
What on earth could drive a man

55:16.809 --> 55:19.679
to kill his own flesh and blood?

55:20.880 --> 55:22.514
Maybe she disappointed him.

55:51.944 --> 55:52.945
Hey.

55:53.980 --> 55:54.847
Hey.

55:59.085 --> 55:59.986
You okay?

56:01.187 --> 56:02.021
Not really.

56:18.570 --> 56:21.273
I know you're having a tough
time at the moment, and...

56:23.876 --> 56:25.211
I've been workin' so much.

56:26.846 --> 56:29.614
Haven't been here as
much as I should've.

56:29.648 --> 56:30.282
It's fine.

56:32.018 --> 56:32.818
No, it's not.

56:35.955 --> 56:37.555
Your mother, before she passed,

56:38.924 --> 56:42.728
she made me promise that
I'd always be there for you.

56:43.362 --> 56:44.196
You have been.

56:46.598 --> 56:47.233
But not enough.

56:50.136 --> 56:53.773
I thought, we need the
money, I'll do more shifts,

56:53.806 --> 56:56.709
but if I was bein'
honest with myself,

56:56.742 --> 56:57.810
I just couldn't...

56:59.145 --> 57:01.781
I couldn't just stay at home.

57:03.649 --> 57:04.984
Alone with my thoughts.

57:07.119 --> 57:08.020
It was a struggle.

57:11.057 --> 57:13.192
I still think about your
mother all the time.

57:15.361 --> 57:16.195
I just can't...

57:19.098 --> 57:21.767
Focus on the good
times, I just...

57:26.939 --> 57:27.840
I miss her too.

57:35.681 --> 57:39.118
I'm gonna be here
for you, Steph.

57:39.151 --> 57:39.985
More.

57:42.388 --> 57:44.990
I'm gonna be here for you more.

57:47.426 --> 57:48.260
I promise.

01:00:22.381 --> 01:00:24.083
This house is
one of the best properties

01:00:24.116 --> 01:00:26.252
on the market right now.

01:00:26.285 --> 01:00:27.253
Perfect for a family.

01:00:31.557 --> 01:00:35.861
Well, I find that most things
start and end with a family.

01:00:37.296 --> 01:00:38.897
One way or another.

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:51.910
Wow.

01:00:53.412 --> 01:00:55.981
Quite the attention
to detail there, Dave.

01:00:56.015 --> 01:00:57.950
Great job, really
intricate work.

01:00:58.317 --> 01:01:00.019
Thank you.

01:01:00.052 --> 01:01:04.189
Question is, how close is
this to how List looks now?

01:01:06.225 --> 01:01:07.559
Show tapes tomorrow.

01:01:09.094 --> 01:01:10.296
We'll find out soon enough.

01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:13.025
Well, it's your
shot today, Frank.

01:02:13.058 --> 01:02:14.026
I'm kinda nervous.

01:02:14.059 --> 01:02:15.961
Don't worry about it.

01:02:15.994 --> 01:02:18.230
There are only 15 million
people gonna be watching.

01:02:18.263 --> 01:02:19.064
Nothing to be nervous about.

01:02:19.098 --> 01:02:21.233
You know how to
put a mind at ease.

01:02:22.401 --> 01:02:23.235
You'll be fine.

01:02:23.268 --> 01:02:24.503
Just follow my lead.

01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:26.538
The important thing to remember

01:02:26.572 --> 01:02:30.142
is that maybe one of
those 15 million people

01:02:30.175 --> 01:02:31.243
know where John List is,

01:02:32.511 --> 01:02:34.446
and we finally nail
that son of a bitch.

01:02:36.281 --> 01:02:37.316
Come on.

01:02:41.153 --> 01:02:42.521
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's me.

01:02:44.022 --> 01:02:45.224
<i>You okay?</i>

01:02:45.257 --> 01:02:47.459
I was gonna ask
you the same thing.

01:02:47.493 --> 01:02:50.129
How come you didn't
come over tonight?

01:02:50.162 --> 01:02:54.066
- <i>I had football practice.</i>
- It's Wednesday.

01:02:54.099 --> 01:02:56.168
Isn't practice
usually on Thursday?

01:02:57.336 --> 01:02:59.338
<i>Uh, they moved it.</i>

01:03:00.372 --> 01:03:02.007
Don't lie to me, Danny.

01:03:03.308 --> 01:03:05.310
<i>All right, you want
me to say it?</i>

01:03:06.545 --> 01:03:08.447
<i>I'm kinda freaked out.</i>

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.651
<i>I mean, that guy broke into
my car and he threatened me.</i>

01:03:11.684 --> 01:03:13.419
It's okay to be scared.

01:03:13.452 --> 01:03:14.386
I am too.

01:03:15.421 --> 01:03:16.422
<i>I just don't
know what to do.</i>

01:03:16.455 --> 01:03:19.324
<i>I mean, that prick said
he was watching me.</i>

01:03:19.358 --> 01:03:21.026
He's watching both of us.

01:03:24.363 --> 01:03:26.265
<i>So what are we gonna do?</i>

01:03:27.366 --> 01:03:28.500
I don't know.

01:03:28.534 --> 01:03:30.502
But I do know that
being together

01:03:30.536 --> 01:03:32.337
is better than being apart.

01:03:33.338 --> 01:03:34.239
<i>Makes sense.</i>

01:03:35.441 --> 01:03:37.242
Or to put it bluntly,

01:03:37.276 --> 01:03:40.345
if you still care about me
at all, then get over here.

01:03:42.481 --> 01:03:44.283
<i>I do still
care about you.</i>

01:03:46.084 --> 01:03:47.152
<i>I love you, Steph.</i>

01:03:48.253 --> 01:03:49.555
<i>Nothing has changed
on that front.</i>

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:53.225
Then stick with me on this.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.427
<i>I will.</i>

01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:10.643
Hey, Steph.

01:04:10.677 --> 01:04:13.045
Wanna watch some TV
with your old man?

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.482
Danny and Melissa
are coming over.

01:04:16.515 --> 01:04:18.050
That's later.

01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:20.385
Come and watch some
TV with your old man!

01:04:20.419 --> 01:04:22.988
It's good to get outta the
bedroom for a while, no?

01:04:23.656 --> 01:04:25.491
Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:04:26.525 --> 01:04:27.627
What are you watching?

01:04:28.761 --> 01:04:30.095
Nothing much.

01:04:30.128 --> 01:04:31.764
Just waiting for
this show to come on,

01:04:31.798 --> 01:04:33.398
the one where they track down

01:04:33.432 --> 01:04:35.100
America's most wanted criminals.

01:04:35.133 --> 01:04:36.435
You ever seen it?

01:04:36.836 --> 01:04:38.337
No.

01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:40.038
It's pretty interesting.

01:04:41.674 --> 01:04:44.543
I was gonna make a
sandwich, you want one?

01:04:46.144 --> 01:04:47.513
Yeah, sure.

01:04:47.546 --> 01:04:49.248
All right, okay.

01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:51.183
Yeah.

01:04:57.489 --> 01:04:59.726
<i>Good evening, I'm John Wesley.</i>

01:05:01.393 --> 01:05:03.262
<i>Those of you who
are regular viewers</i>

01:05:03.295 --> 01:05:07.466
<i>know that we highlight
mostly recent cases.</i>

01:05:07.499 --> 01:05:11.503
But tonight, we're turning
back the clock 18 years

01:05:11.537 --> 01:05:14.707
to November the ninth, 1971,

01:05:14.741 --> 01:05:18.176
<i>when a seemingly
mild-manner accountant</i>

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:20.145
<i>and churchgoer, John List...</i>

01:05:20.178 --> 01:05:22.581
Dad!

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:26.285
What's wrong?

01:05:26.318 --> 01:05:28.487
Look, they're talking
about John List!

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.222
Remember I showed
you that magazine?

01:05:33.893 --> 01:05:36.495
The guy you think is
living across the street?

01:05:36.528 --> 01:05:38.631
It's not funny, Dad.

01:05:38.665 --> 01:05:39.398
Look.

01:05:41.567 --> 01:05:43.569
We hope that someone
out there tonight

01:05:43.602 --> 01:05:45.738
may know where he is.

01:05:45.772 --> 01:05:48.307
We consulted a number of
profilers over those years

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.242
and they speculate that List

01:05:50.275 --> 01:05:53.145
may have obsessive
compulsive disorder

01:05:53.178 --> 01:05:55.648
and other associative disorders.

01:05:55.682 --> 01:05:58.450
<i>Control is very
important to this man.</i>

01:05:59.117 --> 01:06:01.453
<i>Control can be ever so subtle,</i>

01:06:01.486 --> 01:06:05.792
<i>often hidden behind the
pretense of help or advice,</i>

01:06:05.825 --> 01:06:08.560
<i>suggestion, or even a joke.</i>

01:06:08.594 --> 01:06:09.595
<i>Maybe there's someone
out there tonight</i>

01:06:09.629 --> 01:06:12.397
<i>who may recognize this
key characteristic.</i>

01:06:13.298 --> 01:06:14.199
Interesting.

01:06:14.232 --> 01:06:15.902
I know you mentioned that List

01:06:15.935 --> 01:06:18.437
went to great pains
to cover his tracks,

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:21.440
he removed himself from
all family photographs

01:06:21.473 --> 01:06:24.543
and wasn't particularly
a social person.

01:06:24.576 --> 01:06:28.480
So it's very difficult for
you to obtain a photograph

01:06:28.513 --> 01:06:30.582
for identification purposes.

01:06:30.616 --> 01:06:33.585
That's right, we had one very,
very old photograph to go on,

01:06:33.619 --> 01:06:35.621
but now, thanks to the work

01:06:35.655 --> 01:06:38.490
of the esteemed forensic
artist Dave Brenton,

01:06:38.523 --> 01:06:40.459
we have a bust of List's head,

01:06:40.492 --> 01:06:42.629
which we have age progressed,

01:06:42.662 --> 01:06:44.196
and should be able to
give the viewers a...

01:06:46.198 --> 01:06:47.232
Holy shit!

01:06:47.265 --> 01:06:48.668
I told you Dad, I told you!

01:06:48.701 --> 01:06:51.236
Oh, oh shit!

01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:52.537
Oh... shit.

01:06:52.571 --> 01:06:53.706
We need to call the cops.

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.742
Whoa, let's not get hasty here.

01:06:55.775 --> 01:06:57.376
What else are we gonna do?

01:07:24.003 --> 01:07:26.673
Uh, maybe I could go over to him

01:07:26.706 --> 01:07:29.574
and talk to him, make
sure it's really him.

01:07:29.608 --> 01:07:30.575
Dad, are you crazy?

01:07:30.609 --> 01:07:32.277
He's a mass murderer!

01:08:03.575 --> 01:08:04.644
Okay, okay.

01:08:06.478 --> 01:08:07.680
Let me call the cops.

01:08:07.714 --> 01:08:09.314
Yeah, let them deal with it.

01:08:09.347 --> 01:08:10.415
Okay, okay.

01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:24.563
Dad?

01:08:29.501 --> 01:08:30.569
Dad, the power's out.

01:08:44.884 --> 01:08:45.718
Dad?

01:09:08.372 --> 01:09:09.008
Shut up!

01:09:12.645 --> 01:09:15.014
I just wanted to be left alone.

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:18.651
You just couldn't
leave me be, could ya?

01:09:20.685 --> 01:09:22.453
You just had to keep
snoopin' around, didn't ya?

01:09:22.921 --> 01:09:24.023
- Sorry.
- Shut up!

01:09:25.825 --> 01:09:27.627
I didn't want it
to come to this.

01:09:28.795 --> 01:09:29.761
I have no choice.

01:09:30.729 --> 01:09:32.999
It's time to give you
up to the Almighty!

01:10:36.528 --> 01:10:37.529
Stephanie.

01:10:44.804 --> 01:10:45.805
Stephanie!

01:11:07.559 --> 01:11:09.028
Steph?

01:11:10.129 --> 01:11:11.563
Jimmy, hello?

01:11:22.842 --> 01:11:24.744
Maybe they went out.

01:11:24.777 --> 01:11:26.913
Steph struggles to get around,

01:11:26.946 --> 01:11:28.114
so why would she go out

01:11:28.147 --> 01:11:29.982
if she knew that we
were coming over?

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:39.591
Is he okay?

01:11:46.799 --> 01:11:47.900
He's still breathing.

01:11:49.902 --> 01:11:51.938
Um, go in there, call the cops.

01:11:51.971 --> 01:11:53.940
I'm gonna make sure
that Steph's all right.

01:11:53.973 --> 01:11:54.941
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:11:58.844 --> 01:11:59.812
Oh shit!

01:12:01.847 --> 01:12:03.649
Go Mel, call the cops!

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:05.483
Go, go!

01:12:35.715 --> 01:12:37.149
You okay, kid?

01:12:37.183 --> 01:12:39.551
Yeah, are you?

01:12:40.953 --> 01:12:42.620
Nothin' a few stitches

01:12:42.655 --> 01:12:45.758
and a couple of painkillers
won't take care of.

01:12:48.961 --> 01:12:49.862
Steph!

01:12:52.298 --> 01:12:56.002
Hey!

01:12:56.035 --> 01:12:57.870
- Dad.
- Hey!

01:13:08.647 --> 01:13:09.281
Dad!

01:14:00.966 --> 01:14:04.970
Oh shit, oh
shit, oh shit...

01:16:06.825 --> 01:16:10.930
You know, I've waited 18
years for this moment.

01:16:11.897 --> 01:16:15.701
For the chance to be
face to face with you.

01:16:18.804 --> 01:16:20.072
To ask you...

01:16:22.408 --> 01:16:23.943
how you could do it?

01:16:27.546 --> 01:16:29.181
The truth is, no
answer you can give

01:16:29.215 --> 01:16:31.150
will help me sleep
better at night.

01:16:34.086 --> 01:16:36.355
But what will help is knowing

01:16:36.388 --> 01:16:38.457
you're gonna spend
the rest of your days

01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:40.159
in an eight by nine cell.

01:16:42.361 --> 01:16:44.129
And for every single
one of those days,

01:16:44.163 --> 01:16:46.365
you'll be looking over
your shoulder in fear

01:16:47.466 --> 01:16:49.835
of vigilante justice
at any moment.

01:16:53.472 --> 01:16:55.274
You'll finally
know what it's like

01:16:56.942 --> 01:17:00.980
to feel the terror your family
felt as you murdered them.

01:17:04.049 --> 01:17:07.119
And, after all of that...

01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:12.091
You'll still have hell
to look forward to.
