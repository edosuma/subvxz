00:20.423 --> 00:23.083
I wonder that you're still talking,
Signor Benedick.

00:23.123 --> 00:24.963
Nobody marks you.

00:25.003 --> 00:26.443
Get on with it!

00:26.483 --> 00:28.723
What, my dear Lady Disdain!

00:28.763 --> 00:30.483
Are you yet <i>living</i> ?

00:33.203 --> 00:37.323
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me.

00:38.563 --> 00:39.963
Get on with it!

00:40.003 --> 00:43.483
Mr Condell is going down
like a lead inflated pig's bladder.

00:43.523 --> 00:44.763
I know.

00:44.803 --> 00:46.763
The groundlings don't like him
as they did.

00:46.803 --> 00:48.403
Aye, cos he's got old and ugly.

00:48.443 --> 00:53.083
'Tis true. His face, once soft and plumpsome
as a pixie's bumble-butt,

00:53.123 --> 00:55.643
be now craggy, hard and hairy,

00:55.683 --> 00:58.043
like a goblin's scroting satchel.

00:59.563 --> 01:01.203
See how Burbage hogs the bows.

01:01.243 --> 01:02.683
Wrong, so wrong.

01:02.723 --> 01:04.322
His head is grown so large,

01:04.363 --> 01:08.083
this hollow O that is our theatre
will soon be fit to be his crown!

01:08.123 --> 01:10.523
I must be <i>rid</i> of Burbage.

01:12.403 --> 01:14.483
I must be <i>rid</i> of Condell.

01:18.603 --> 01:20.363
You seem a bit low, Kate.
Why?

01:20.403 --> 01:22.563
I am fearful for my future,
Mr Marlowe.

01:22.603 --> 01:25.403
Well, don't think about it.
Live for today.

01:25.443 --> 01:29.523
Easy to say if you're a <i>man</i>, Mr Marlowe,
but a woman has not that luxury.

01:29.563 --> 01:32.803
My mother is ageing and like to die.
Although, quite frankly,

01:32.843 --> 01:35.883
with the amount of slap and tickling she
does with her bits of saucy ruffington,

01:35.923 --> 01:38.283
she's more like to die of exhaustion
than old age.

01:38.323 --> 01:41.283
But when she does, what of me?

01:41.323 --> 01:46.003
As a widow, she has legal rights,
but I will be a spinster, a non-person.

01:46.043 --> 01:50.123
I will have this property
and my mother's money but no legal status,

01:50.163 --> 01:54.123
prey to every exploitative, opportunist,
gold-digging rogue.

01:54.163 --> 01:56.603
Kate, this could be the perfect fit!

01:56.643 --> 01:59.323
I mean, you have property and money,
and I...

01:59.363 --> 02:01.443
Am an exploitative, opportunist,
gold-digging rogue?

02:01.483 --> 02:03.123
Exactly!

02:03.163 --> 02:07.183
Better the exploitative, opportunist,
gold-digging rogue you <i>know</i>.

02:07.883 --> 02:09.923
I <i>must</i> be rid of Condell.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.123
He can play the totty no longer.

02:12.163 --> 02:15.203
Tonight, his Beatrice was about
as charming and coquettish

02:15.243 --> 02:18.403
as Henry VIII trying to get
his rotting and ulcerated left leg

02:18.443 --> 02:21.083
over his sweet and fragrant sixth wife.

02:22.283 --> 02:25.803
I cannot bear the idea
that Condell will give my Calpurnia.

02:25.843 --> 02:29.123
Calpurnia?
Is your next play going to be about Julius Caesar?

02:29.163 --> 02:34.363
That's the plan. Exciting, don't you think?
Ancient Rome. So cool, so sexy.

02:34.403 --> 02:37.243
Can't imagine why I didn't think
of doing a Caesar play before.

02:37.283 --> 02:40.883
Possibly because Thomas North has only
very recently published his translation

02:40.923 --> 02:43.083
of Plutarch's Lives Of The Noble Romans,

02:43.123 --> 02:45.163
so you had no source
from which to pinch it.

02:46.283 --> 02:48.283
Plutarch's Lives Of The Noble Romans?

02:48.323 --> 02:49.523
Not sure I've heard of it.

02:49.563 --> 02:51.883
I bought it last week
and have been reading it in the privy.

02:51.923 --> 02:54.763
Well, I may have glanced at it while...

02:54.803 --> 02:57.603
while awaiting the appearance
of that shy turtle who doth dwell

02:57.643 --> 02:59.363
betwixt the twin boulders

02:59.403 --> 03:01.523
and who emerges into the light

03:01.563 --> 03:05.683
only to hurl himself straightway
into the dark abyss.

03:05.723 --> 03:07.723
Stealing plots again, eh, master?

03:07.763 --> 03:09.523
Look, I've got to base my plays
on something.

03:09.563 --> 03:12.803
They can't all be about
amusingly confused cross-dressers.

03:13.303 --> 03:14.643
Can they?

03:15.203 --> 03:18.603
Definitely <i>not</i>.
And I must say, a Roman play does sound good.

03:18.643 --> 03:20.123
I mean, those guys were <i>crazy</i>.

03:20.163 --> 03:22.483
Murdering, gorging, puking...

03:22.523 --> 03:25.003
And, of course, creating a united Europe

03:25.043 --> 03:28.923
with a single currency, no trade barriers,
free movement of labour

03:28.963 --> 03:31.283
and a unified legal system.

03:31.323 --> 03:32.323
Hmm.

03:32.363 --> 03:35.043
Yeah...
Might leave that out.

03:36.363 --> 03:39.323
Not sure how well
it would play to us Brits.

03:39.363 --> 03:42.083
Well, I think you're onto a winner, mate.
I don't know much history,

03:42.123 --> 03:45.163
but I do know that Caesar's life
was absolutely action packed.

03:45.203 --> 03:46.723
Goodness, wasn't it just?!

03:46.763 --> 03:47.923
Three marriages,

03:47.963 --> 03:53.483
numerous mistresses, including...
Excuse me!... Cleo-flipping-patra,

03:53.523 --> 03:58.083
conquered half the known world,
crossed the Rubicon, became dictator for life,

03:58.123 --> 04:00.123
stabbed to death by his best mates!

04:00.163 --> 04:04.203
I mean, goodness, so many <i>amazing</i> events!

04:04.243 --> 04:05.483
Absolutely.

04:05.523 --> 04:09.723
So, I thought I'd focus on the short
weekend break he took to Kent in 55 BC.

04:10.963 --> 04:15.683
Mr Shakespeare, Caesar's attempt to invade
Britain was an absolute nonstarter.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.803
His forces scarcely got off the beach.

04:17.843 --> 04:20.642
Exactly. I thought I'd play
the whole thing as a light comedy

04:20.683 --> 04:22.083
about a trip to the seaside.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.963
He came, he saw, he had a little paddle.

04:27.283 --> 04:30.323
Surely the play should be
about Caesar's murder.

04:30.363 --> 04:35.003
Such an exciting story
of assassination, regicide and betrayal.

04:35.043 --> 04:36.243
Yes, Kate.

04:36.283 --> 04:38.643
Assassination, regicide and betrayal.

04:38.683 --> 04:41.323
Any thoughts on who
might object to such themes?

04:42.323 --> 04:45.003
Balding, ginger, owns a large axe?

04:46.003 --> 04:48.443
Oh, goodness,
I didn't think about that.

04:48.483 --> 04:52.883
There was a mysterious hooded figure at the door.
Left this note.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.843
Zounds!

04:55.883 --> 04:57.883
Condell plots against Burbage.

04:57.923 --> 05:02.763
He has summoned the company and will
betray him on the steps of the stage.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.243
Condell invites me
to join the conspirators.

05:06.283 --> 05:07.523
This is terrible.

05:07.563 --> 05:09.963
If Condell becomes chief luvvie-kissie,

05:10.003 --> 05:13.843
he'll be playing the teenage totty
until his seventh age.

05:13.883 --> 05:15.643
Enter the gorgeous Calpurnia...

05:15.683 --> 05:19.603
sans eyes, sans teeth, sans everything.

05:19.643 --> 05:22.003
Ouch.
You're going to have to stop him, mate.

05:22.043 --> 05:24.643
But how?
He writes that the company are on his side.

05:24.683 --> 05:26.363
He has the mob behind him.

05:26.403 --> 05:29.843
Well, it strikes me that,
rather coincidentally,

05:29.883 --> 05:32.803
this is all somewhat reminiscent
of the death of Caesar.

05:32.843 --> 05:35.203
I can't be worrying
about my Roman play now, Kate.

05:35.243 --> 05:37.163
I have to deal with Mr Condell.

05:37.203 --> 05:40.283
In Plutarch's story,
it all goes wrong for the conspirators

05:40.323 --> 05:44.083
because Mark Antony turns up
after the murder and sways the mob.

05:44.123 --> 05:46.203
My goodness, Kate, you're right.

05:46.243 --> 05:50.443
I will go to the steps of the stage and
play Mark Antony to Condell's Brutus.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.443
Yes.
And getting back to your play,

05:52.483 --> 05:55.203
don't forget that
after Mark Antony's intervention,

05:55.243 --> 05:59.083
Caesar is avenged
and all the conspirators end up dead.

05:59.123 --> 06:02.323
It seems to me,
if you put <i>that</i> part of the story,

06:02.363 --> 06:04.403
Her Majesty might rather approve it.

06:04.443 --> 06:05.883
Actually, that's a very good point.

06:05.923 --> 06:07.523
- Thanks.
- Glad I thought of it.

06:08.723 --> 06:13.723
Mr Shakespeare promises us a Roman play,
and all is in readiness.

06:13.763 --> 06:16.563
We have the costumes, wigs and props.

06:16.603 --> 06:19.083
We await only the script.
And mark me!

06:19.123 --> 06:23.243
<i>My</i> Caesar will be a triumph
greater even than the man <i>himself</i>!

06:23.283 --> 06:27.243
Why, man, he doth bestride
the narrow world like a Colossus,

06:27.283 --> 06:29.963
and we petty men walk under his huge legs

06:30.003 --> 06:32.043
and peep about to find ourselves

06:32.083 --> 06:35.083
getting upstaged at the final bows.

06:35.123 --> 06:38.603
Hm. Or... Put better...
He ain't all that, and it's time he got shafted.

06:38.643 --> 06:41.203
But do we have the numbers?

06:41.243 --> 06:42.883
Ah, Longinus approaches.

06:42.923 --> 06:45.443
The musicians are with you, sir.

06:45.483 --> 06:49.483
Mr Burbage is a foul tyrant who
did once take a pee in the kettledrum.

06:49.523 --> 06:50.763
And the mob players?

06:50.803 --> 06:52.283
With you also.

06:52.323 --> 06:55.283
Though beg that
when you be chief luvvie-kissie,

06:55.323 --> 06:58.443
you make Mr Shakespeare
shorten his soliloquies

06:58.483 --> 07:01.163
through which we must stand
for many hours

07:01.203 --> 07:03.203
pretending to understand.

07:03.243 --> 07:04.883
And the thunder-board wobbler?

07:04.923 --> 07:06.363
The front-of-house prostitutes?

07:08.123 --> 07:10.603
Then <i>all</i> is ready.
Come, Kempe.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.643
Brothers.
Burbage is a tyrant.

07:16.683 --> 07:18.603
'Tis time to end this tyranny.

07:18.643 --> 07:20.203
Strike him down.

07:20.243 --> 07:21.963
What means this <i>outrage</i> ?!

07:22.003 --> 07:25.403
You hog the final bows,
which is <i>totally</i> unprofessional.

07:25.443 --> 07:27.643
You get your own dressing place,
which is just <i>so</i> wrong.

07:27.683 --> 07:31.163
And you farted
when my Beatrice kissed your Benedick.

07:31.203 --> 07:32.883
We need a new chief luvvie-kissie!

07:34.043 --> 07:36.203
Et tu, Mr Condell?

07:36.243 --> 07:37.843
Et tu, Kempe?

07:37.883 --> 07:41.163
Then fall, Burbage!
Betrayed!

07:41.203 --> 07:44.043
Liberty! Freedom!
Tyranny is dead!

07:44.083 --> 07:45.963
Ambition's debt is paid.

07:46.003 --> 07:48.603
I am chief luvvie-kissie now!

07:49.683 --> 07:52.603
What's this?
Be... Be Burbage usurped?

07:52.643 --> 07:55.083
Yes.
And it's no good you trying to object,

07:55.123 --> 07:57.203
because the musicians, the mob players,

07:57.243 --> 07:58.723
the man who wobbles the thunder-sheet

07:58.763 --> 08:01.363
<i>and</i> the front-of-house prostitutes
are all with me.

08:01.403 --> 08:03.763
Hail, Kempe! Hail, Condell!

08:03.803 --> 08:06.843
Object?
Why would I object?

08:06.883 --> 08:10.363
Friends, prostitutes,
strutty, shouty boys,

08:10.403 --> 08:12.203
pin back your lugholes.

08:12.243 --> 08:15.243
I come to <i>bury</i> Burbage,
not to praise him.

08:15.283 --> 08:16.763
Betrayed!

08:16.803 --> 08:20.443
Burbage was my friend,
faithful and just to me.

08:20.483 --> 08:23.003
But Condell says he was ambitious,

08:23.043 --> 08:26.003
- and Condell is an honourable man.
- Yes!

08:26.043 --> 08:29.403
Condell has said
that Burbage doth hog the final bows

08:29.443 --> 08:32.563
and will ever parp
the loud and boisterous trouser trumpet

08:32.602 --> 08:35.523
during other actors' quiet bits.

08:35.563 --> 08:38.683
- And Condell is an honourable man.
- Hooray!

08:38.722 --> 08:42.003
<i>Yet</i>, Burbage will always
get his round in at the pub

08:42.043 --> 08:45.603
and will keep us enthralled for many...
<i>many</i> hours

08:45.643 --> 08:48.163
with but a <i>single</i> theatrical anecdote.

08:48.203 --> 08:51.163
Does <i>this</i> in Burbage seem ambitious?

08:51.203 --> 08:53.843
Yet Condell <i>says</i> he is ambitious,

08:53.883 --> 08:56.163
and Condell is an honourable man.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.003
Yeah...

08:58.043 --> 09:00.683
When all the company do venture forth
for a celebratory supper

09:00.723 --> 09:03.883
and the reckoning is brought,
and some glutton or other doth cry,

09:03.923 --> 09:06.203
"Why don't we just spit it equally?"

09:06.243 --> 09:09.603
ne'er will <i>Burbage</i> quibble
that he only had a starter.

09:10.563 --> 09:13.283
Does <i>this</i> in Burbage seem ambitious?

09:13.323 --> 09:16.283
Yet Condell <i>says</i> he is ambitious.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.283
And Condell is an honourable man.

09:19.323 --> 09:20.683
Yeah...

09:20.723 --> 09:22.243
See what he's doing here, mate?

09:22.283 --> 09:25.683
He's using the brilliant oratorical device
of ironic repetition to turn the mob.

09:25.723 --> 09:26.763
You've been shafted.

09:26.803 --> 09:29.323
But if we stand together,
we can face down the mob.

09:29.363 --> 09:30.923
Yeah, right, gonna do that!

09:30.963 --> 09:32.563
Burbage is wronged!

09:32.603 --> 09:33.723
Condell be the traitor!

09:35.283 --> 09:36.803
Burbage is chief luvvie-kissie.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.003
Hail, Burbage!

09:38.043 --> 09:39.723
Hail, Burbage!

09:39.763 --> 09:43.963
Will, your brilliant oratorical device
of ironic repetition has saved me.

09:44.003 --> 09:45.683
Is there anything I can do for you?

09:45.723 --> 09:47.963
A drink?
A lengthy theatrical anecdote?

09:48.003 --> 09:49.963
Oh, well, that would be lovely, of course,

09:50.003 --> 09:54.803
but what I'd <i>really</i> like to discuss
is the casting of my teenage totty roles.

09:58.283 --> 10:00.683
I have come to see you once again,
Miss Lucy,

10:00.723 --> 10:04.723
because you are a strong woman
who is both a woman <i>and</i> strong.

10:04.763 --> 10:06.843
Ah-ah-eh-eh.
I am very strong.

10:06.883 --> 10:10.203
If the angry hippo charges,
do not whisper sweet words.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.723
Whack it with your assegai
and make it your bitch.

10:13.963 --> 10:15.123
Right.

10:15.163 --> 10:19.043
The thing is, my mother is shortly like
to bonk herself off this mortal coil

10:19.083 --> 10:22.203
with her insatiable appetite
for bits of saucy ruffington.

10:22.243 --> 10:25.283
And you are fearful,
lest men circle like hyenas,

10:25.323 --> 10:29.323
steal your monies
and feed on your soft flesh?

10:29.363 --> 10:33.683
Well, I'm not sure I'd mind them
feeding on my soft flesh so much,

10:33.723 --> 10:36.803
you know, as long as it was done
creatively and sensitively

10:36.843 --> 10:38.683
with due consideration for my needs.

10:38.723 --> 10:40.603
Ha!
Good luck with that!

10:40.643 --> 10:44.003
It's my cash I'm concerned about,
and my property.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.723
That's why I have come to you.

10:45.763 --> 10:48.883
You have no man who claims to own you.

10:48.923 --> 10:51.043
At least, not since you cut off the penis

10:51.083 --> 10:53.563
of the man who stole you
from your village.

10:53.603 --> 10:56.083
How do you avoid falling prey
to exploitation?

10:56.123 --> 10:58.203
Hm!
Men are scared of me.

10:58.243 --> 11:01.283
They think I'm a sorceress,
and I do not deny it.

11:01.323 --> 11:04.563
I tell them to beware,
lest I shrink their privy parts.

11:04.603 --> 11:05.603
Hm!

11:06.883 --> 11:10.043
Look at these tiny testicle earrings.

11:10.083 --> 11:14.683
I say that I tore them from a man
and shrunk them, but it is a lie.

11:15.923 --> 11:19.003
In fact, I just castrated
a well-endowed gerbil.

11:19.043 --> 11:20.723
Would you like to borrow them?

11:20.763 --> 11:25.523
Oh! Thanks awfully, but I don't think
I'd be very convincing trying to be scary.

11:25.563 --> 11:29.163
Hm! But you must learn to be scary
if you want to live alone.

11:29.203 --> 11:30.843
But I <i>don't</i> want to live alone.

11:30.883 --> 11:34.963
I just want to find a man
who isn't a selfish, entitled bastable.

11:35.003 --> 11:39.963
So, as I said, you must learn to be scary
if you want to live alone.

11:41.163 --> 11:44.483
"...Glories of this happy day."

11:44.523 --> 11:45.923
Finished!

11:45.963 --> 11:47.363
Julius Caesar.

11:47.403 --> 11:50.243
Best afternoon's work I ever did.

11:50.283 --> 11:53.963
And it won't surprise you to learn
that it's brilliant.

11:54.003 --> 11:55.163
I'm <i>sure</i> it is.

11:55.203 --> 11:58.843
Such an earth-shattering event.
The <i>death</i> of Caesar.

11:58.883 --> 12:01.763
Yes. Hard to believe that
<i>you</i> thought I should set the play

12:01.803 --> 12:05.843
around his abortive
British invasion of 55 BC.

12:05.883 --> 12:08.723
Thank goodness
I didn't listen to <i>you</i>!

12:08.763 --> 12:11.403
Botsky, get this manuscript
round to Greene's.

12:11.443 --> 12:14.283
I hope he doesn't try and find a way
to deny it licence.

12:14.323 --> 12:17.123
Oh, he'll license it, all right.
I've made sure of that.

12:17.163 --> 12:19.203
And I must to the theatre.

12:19.243 --> 12:21.523
Time to use the favour Burbage owes me

12:21.563 --> 12:24.363
to be rid of the ageing
dragsome queenie-preenie

12:24.403 --> 12:29.083
who thinks the key to playing
teenage girls is having pubic eyebrows.

12:31.203 --> 12:32.303
Well?

12:33.603 --> 12:34.763
What do you think?

12:34.803 --> 12:35.963
Pretty saucy?

12:36.003 --> 12:37.523
Pretty sexy?

12:37.563 --> 12:40.203
Did it myself using gunpowder
and lemon juice.

12:42.043 --> 12:43.523
But why?

12:43.563 --> 12:46.803
Isn't it obvious? I'm <i>dead</i>, remember.
I'm going to start life anew!

12:46.843 --> 12:50.423
Kit Marlowe was known as an
<i>utterly ravishing</i> strawberry brunette,

12:50.683 --> 12:54.643
<i>not</i> the drop-dead gorgeous
human daffodil you see before you.

12:55.803 --> 12:58.083
This is the new me.

12:58.123 --> 13:03.563
Being blond, I'll be able to show my more
sensitive, caring, non-gold-digging side.

13:03.603 --> 13:06.163
- I'm not going to marry you, Mr Marlowe.
- Oh, come on, Kate!

13:06.203 --> 13:10.283
It's perfect! You need a husband,
I need a new life and identity.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.283
You have a decent inheritance,
an impressive property portfolio.

13:13.323 --> 13:14.403
I've got...

13:14.443 --> 13:16.683
- A cod-dangle.
- Exactly!

13:16.723 --> 13:19.843
- You and <i>half</i> the people on the planet!
- Yes, but not like mine.

13:22.283 --> 13:24.523
We're talking a Marlowe massive here.

13:26.083 --> 13:30.603
If I marry, Mr Marlowe, it will not be
for rumpy-pumpington, but for security,

13:30.643 --> 13:34.163
and you are the last man on Earth
I would go to for that!

13:35.763 --> 13:39.603
I am sorry, Mr Condell,
but you can't play the totty any more.

13:39.643 --> 13:41.443
Time to hang up your coconuts.

13:41.483 --> 13:43.243
Betrayed!

13:43.283 --> 13:44.523
Betrayed!

13:44.563 --> 13:47.603
Et tu, Mr Shakespeare!

13:47.643 --> 13:49.283
Et tu, Mr Burbage!

13:49.323 --> 13:53.003
Look, we're not saying
you have to give up the boards completely.

13:53.043 --> 13:56.163
Never. I am an actor.
The boards are in my blood!

13:56.203 --> 13:58.363
Oh, is that why your performances
are so wooden?

13:59.443 --> 14:02.203
Who said that?
I did, so...

14:02.243 --> 14:05.523
It's just that you will no longer
play the ingenue.

14:05.563 --> 14:08.483
You shall now take the male second leads.

14:08.523 --> 14:09.723
Er, hello?

14:09.763 --> 14:12.243
I take the second leads,
cos I'm big in Italy.

14:12.283 --> 14:14.923
In which case,
I suggest you go and perform there.

14:14.963 --> 14:18.363
Betrayed. So betrayed.
Like, mad betrayed.

14:18.403 --> 14:20.723
There are <i>loads</i> of great parts.
Enough for all.

14:20.763 --> 14:23.003
For you, I thought Brutus, Mr Condell.

14:23.043 --> 14:24.643
And Mark Antony for Kempe.

14:24.683 --> 14:26.603
Both are pivotal.
Wait till you read them.

14:26.643 --> 14:30.163
It's not us that must needs read the play,
though, Will, but Robert Greene.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.003
And I must confess,
I'm slightly worried on that score.

14:33.043 --> 14:36.723
A play that includes assassination,
regicide and betrayal

14:36.763 --> 14:40.163
<i>must</i> prove contentious,
with Her Majesty's life ever threatened.

14:40.203 --> 14:42.843
Greene could use just such an excuse
to <i>ban</i> us.

14:42.883 --> 14:46.603
Way ahead of you, Mr Burbage,
<i>way</i> ahead of you.

14:46.643 --> 14:50.363
The Crow is in my clutches <i>at last</i>!

14:50.403 --> 14:55.563
This extremely short Roman play
be clearly seditious.

14:55.603 --> 14:59.403
It celebrates the murder of a ruler.

14:59.443 --> 15:03.203
Well, I will grant his application.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.403
And when the play is performed...

15:07.443 --> 15:12.323
then cry, "Havoc,"
and let slip the dogs of war.

15:13.883 --> 15:15.803
You see,
I've only sent him <i>half</i> the play.

15:15.843 --> 15:17.923
He thinks it ends
with the death of Caesar,

15:17.963 --> 15:20.603
but, in fact,
Caesar dies at the beginning of Act III.

15:20.643 --> 15:21.963
Oh, I see.

15:22.003 --> 15:23.323
Oh, yes, that is rather...

15:23.363 --> 15:24.843
What?!

15:24.883 --> 15:27.923
Caesar <i>dies</i> halfway through the play?!

15:27.963 --> 15:31.163
Well, a bit <i>less</i> than half, in fact.
About 40%.

15:31.203 --> 15:33.003
But it's the <i>title</i> role!

15:33.043 --> 15:36.323
Well, you know, they <i>talk</i> about him
quite a lot in the second half.

15:36.363 --> 15:37.563
<i>Talk</i> about him?!

15:37.603 --> 15:41.723
You write a title role and kill him off
at the beginning of Act III?

15:41.763 --> 15:43.283
Betrayed!

15:43.323 --> 15:44.683
Betrayed!

15:44.723 --> 15:46.603
A <i>second</i> time betrayed!

15:46.643 --> 15:48.203
Et tu, Mr Shakespeare!

15:48.243 --> 15:51.443
I shall <i>not</i> present this play!

15:51.483 --> 15:55.483
We shall give Greene's
Bungay And Bacon instead.

15:55.523 --> 15:57.483
No, no, wait.
Mr Burbage...

15:57.523 --> 16:01.363
What about if I brought Caesar back in Act IV...
as a ghost?

16:03.283 --> 16:05.923
A ghost?
You'd do that? No tricks?

16:05.963 --> 16:07.803
Well, you know, if I <i>have</i> to.

16:07.843 --> 16:12.403
I suppose it might work.
I... could use my... deathly howl.

16:12.443 --> 16:14.323
Ooooooh!
Ooooh!

16:14.363 --> 16:16.163
Ooooooooh-oh-oh.

16:17.523 --> 16:19.603
Yes, absolutely.
Or...

16:19.643 --> 16:20.803
Or else <i>not</i>.

16:22.123 --> 16:24.323
Very well.
Reluctantly, I agree.

16:24.363 --> 16:28.483
And when Greene tries to close us down for
presenting a play that ends with regicide,

16:28.523 --> 16:32.323
we will disgrace him by showing how the
conspirators all get their just deserts.

16:32.363 --> 16:35.243
Yes, by being haunted and tormented

16:35.283 --> 16:38.083
by Caesar's omniscient, ever-present,

16:38.123 --> 16:39.603
avenging,

16:39.643 --> 16:42.043
constantly <i>ho-o-o-o-owling</i> ghost

16:42.083 --> 16:43.803
in every single scene!

16:43.843 --> 16:45.203
Absolutely.

16:45.243 --> 16:47.763
Or maybe just briefly
in Act IV, Scene III.

16:48.923 --> 16:51.323
16 words should do it, I think.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.563
Right, I'm ready.

16:57.603 --> 17:00.203
- Ready for what?
- The auditions, of course.

17:00.243 --> 17:02.483
You're choosing a new principal boy,
aren't you?

17:02.523 --> 17:06.723
And since you've always admitted
that I play a girl better than any boy,

17:06.762 --> 17:10.643
and also 'twas I who pointed out
the Roman strategy that did for Mr Condell,

17:10.683 --> 17:13.242
plus I left Plutarch's Lives
in the privy,

17:13.282 --> 17:16.443
plus I pointed out
how to make the play Queen-friendly,

17:16.483 --> 17:19.083
I <i>naturally</i> presumed you'd let me
try again to get into the company

17:19.123 --> 17:21.683
because I really, really want to,
and it's my dream!

17:21.723 --> 17:24.563
Look, I'm sorry, Kate, really I am,
but it's the <i>law</i>,

17:24.603 --> 17:26.723
and the law has
<i>zero</i> respect for women.

17:26.762 --> 17:29.083
Because the law was made by <i>men</i>!

17:29.123 --> 17:30.403
I'm sorry, Kate.

17:30.443 --> 17:32.243
Your heart and mind are of the finest,

17:32.283 --> 17:34.283
and yet, for want of a cod-dangle,

17:34.323 --> 17:37.683
you be lowlier than any
base and stupid rogue in Albion.

17:38.883 --> 17:42.683
Your only hope
for comfort and security is to marry.

17:43.803 --> 17:45.203
He's right, Kate.

17:48.563 --> 17:50.203
Are we looking dreamy and hot?

17:50.243 --> 17:51.963
Look, reading poetry.

17:52.003 --> 17:53.923
<i>So</i> sensitive!

17:55.163 --> 17:57.003
It's upside down.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.123
Thy lips are warm.

18:03.163 --> 18:04.603
Yea, noise?

18:04.643 --> 18:06.123
Then I'll be brief.

18:06.163 --> 18:07.283
O happy dagger!

18:07.323 --> 18:09.043
This is thy sheath.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.923
There rust, and let me die.

18:10.963 --> 18:12.283
Oh!

18:17.003 --> 18:20.043
I also have dance, intermediary
stage fighting and some tumbling.

18:20.583 --> 18:21.643
Impressive.

18:21.683 --> 18:26.803
My accents are West Country: Ooh arr!
And Scottish: Och aye!

18:26.843 --> 18:28.883
And those are the hard ones.

18:28.923 --> 18:31.403
Gentlemen, we have found our boy.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.323
<i>Girl</i>, Burbage.
I'm sure of it.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.603
It's happened again.

18:35.643 --> 18:39.643
Another nasty little bitchington
trying to lie her way into the theatre.

18:39.683 --> 18:44.923
I demand that the Master of Revels be
called to study this person's credentials.

18:44.963 --> 18:49.483
Well, Mr Burbage, I have studied
this person's credentials,

18:49.523 --> 18:53.603
and, while small and lacking in maturity,
<i>all</i> is present and correct.

18:53.643 --> 18:55.523
But he's got boobingtons.

18:55.563 --> 18:57.523
Oh, yes, I forgot to mention that.

18:57.563 --> 19:01.923
I have dance, stage fighting, various accents
<i>and</i> can supply own breasts.

19:01.963 --> 19:03.083
Ridiculous!

19:03.123 --> 19:04.763
Where would he put the coconuts?

19:04.803 --> 19:06.323
How can this be, Mr Greene?

19:06.363 --> 19:09.203
Toby is a hermaphrodite, Mr Burbage.

19:09.243 --> 19:10.883
But such folk are a myth.

19:10.923 --> 19:13.963
On the contrary. To be born with some
of the physical attributes of both sexes

19:14.003 --> 19:16.603
is a recognised medical condition.

19:16.643 --> 19:19.203
Some societies <i>embrace</i> such differences.

19:19.243 --> 19:20.683
<i>Ours</i> does not.

19:20.723 --> 19:22.603
Sirrah, what sex be you?

19:22.643 --> 19:24.763
D'you know,
I'm quite conflicted about that, actually.

19:24.803 --> 19:28.283
How be you described in the records
at your parish church?

19:28.653 --> 19:32.323
- Boy, sir.
- In that case, you are a boy by law.

19:33.003 --> 19:36.803
And, Mr Shakespeare...
<i>Do</i> hurry along with your Julius Caesar play.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.803
I am so looking forward
to the first night.

19:39.843 --> 19:41.043
Good day.

19:42.683 --> 19:45.523
Well, funny old world, eh?
Welcome to the company, Toby.

19:45.563 --> 19:49.363
I' faith, if this Toby joins us,
I will ne'er play the totty again.

19:49.403 --> 19:51.323
Thus must I plot against him.

19:53.203 --> 19:55.643
Mr Kempe, you're big in Italy.

19:55.683 --> 19:57.963
Hast thou the address of
the Milano Commedia Dell'Arte?

19:58.003 --> 20:01.603
Ooh, ha-ha!
Hoping to get a new gig with my Italian mates?

20:01.643 --> 20:03.403
- Oh...
- Not gonna happen.

20:03.443 --> 20:07.763
They don't want some washed-up,
bog-standard, old mincing slap like you.

20:07.803 --> 20:10.723
They're only interested
in the fascinating and unique,

20:10.763 --> 20:13.043
the different and the intriguing.

20:13.083 --> 20:14.443
You've got no chance.

20:14.483 --> 20:17.563
Well, you won't mind giving me
the address, then, will you?

20:19.363 --> 20:20.483
Brilliant news.

20:20.523 --> 20:23.723
We've found our new principal girl,
and 'tis a very miracle,

20:23.763 --> 20:27.963
for, though he be legally a boy,
he has his own boobingtons!.

20:28.003 --> 20:29.483
'Tis a very gift to the theatre,

20:29.523 --> 20:33.043
for what <i>possible</i> type of person
could be <i>better</i> to play a girl

20:33.083 --> 20:34.483
than a boy with boobingtons?

20:35.523 --> 20:37.843
I just <i>can't</i> think, Mr Shakespeare.

20:37.883 --> 20:39.683
It's a mystery!

20:39.723 --> 20:41.523
I don't make the law, Kate.

20:41.563 --> 20:43.723
Now, meet my new ingenue.

20:43.763 --> 20:45.723
Hello, everybody.
I'm Toby.

20:45.763 --> 20:49.083
He has natural talent,
but it is unrefined and lacks technique.

20:49.123 --> 20:52.403
So, I was hoping that perhaps you might
give him a few acting lessons, Kate.

20:52.443 --> 20:54.123
I'd be ever so grateful, Miss Kate.

20:54.163 --> 20:56.043
God, talk about twisting the knife!

20:57.043 --> 20:58.043
All right.

20:58.083 --> 21:01.323
Hang on. I should teach him.
I used to show Kate how to act.

21:03.203 --> 21:04.583
Not quite how I remember it.

21:04.623 --> 21:06.203
<i>You</i> teach Toby to act, Botsky?

21:06.243 --> 21:09.043
And from what fantastical world
of vanity and self-delusion

21:09.083 --> 21:11.243
comes this outrageous claim?

21:11.283 --> 21:15.403
I've seen all your actors acting your
stuff right back to Henry IV, Part 1.

21:15.443 --> 21:17.163
I know the tricks.

21:17.203 --> 21:19.203
Basically, to do Shakespeare...

21:19.243 --> 21:21.603
...you have to shout a bit!

21:21.643 --> 21:24.323
Then go quiet and tense a bit... before...

21:24.363 --> 21:26.083
...shouting again!

21:26.123 --> 21:27.923
Then you have to make a sudden pause

21:27.963 --> 21:30.203
<i>right</i> in the middle of a word
for no rea...

21:30.653 --> 21:31.803
...son at all.

21:32.803 --> 21:37.323
Also, you have to randomly em-<i>pha</i>-sise
certain <i>syll</i>-ables,

21:37.363 --> 21:39.203
also for no appa...

21:39.403 --> 21:40.963
...rent <i>rea</i>-son.

21:42.043 --> 21:43.483
And...
...that...

21:43.523 --> 21:44.763
...is how you...

21:44.803 --> 21:46.323
...act...

21:46.363 --> 21:48.763
...Shake...
...speare!

21:50.323 --> 21:53.803
Actually, Toby, that is basically it.

21:54.643 --> 21:57.563
And then you have to get pisslingtoned
over a nice little supper

21:57.603 --> 21:59.443
and tell everyone <i>you were awful</i>

21:59.483 --> 22:02.523
and they have to say,
"No, no, you were brilliant, darling."

22:04.243 --> 22:06.123
Yes, that bit's <i>very</i> important, too.

22:06.163 --> 22:09.603
Anyway, acting lesson or not,
Toby is going to stay with us for a few days

22:09.643 --> 22:12.083
till Burbage can sort him out
some pay and lodgings.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.603
Just so I know, is he above or below me
in the pecking order?

22:14.643 --> 22:17.443
Botsky, you're not even
<i>in</i> the pecking order.

22:19.483 --> 22:20.563
Betrayed.

22:21.563 --> 22:22.723
Betrayed.

22:25.603 --> 22:28.363
So, Toby, tell me a bit about yourself.

22:28.403 --> 22:30.083
There's not that much to tell,
Miss Kate.

22:30.123 --> 22:31.723
I'm just like any other 16-year-old.

22:31.763 --> 22:36.163
Apart from having been born with both
male and female sexual characteristics?

22:36.203 --> 22:38.163
Yeah, apart from that.

22:38.203 --> 22:39.243
And what about your family?

22:39.283 --> 22:40.723
Oh, lost to me now.

22:40.763 --> 22:42.923
I ran away from home
when I started growing bosoms.

22:42.963 --> 22:44.923
Were you bullied and abused most horribly

22:44.963 --> 22:47.243
for the innocent crime
of being born different?

22:47.283 --> 22:49.923
Oh, no, my parents were
really, really understanding,

22:49.963 --> 22:52.163
giving me the choice of whether
I wanted to live as a boy or a girl.

22:52.203 --> 22:54.203
Oh, that's wonderful!

22:54.243 --> 22:56.163
Yeah.
People in my village were great, too.

22:56.203 --> 22:59.443
Offering me the use of either
the male or female groaning ditches.

22:59.483 --> 23:04.043
Or, if I preferred, they were prepared
to declare both ditches non-sex defined.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.803
In fact, after a unanimous vote
at the parish council,

23:06.843 --> 23:09.923
the whole village decided
to declare itself gender neutral.

23:09.963 --> 23:13.843
Oh! That is incredible.
I mean, <i>amazing</i>!

23:13.883 --> 23:18.083
<i>Never</i> did I think such tolerance
<i>possible</i> in our cruel, cruel times.

23:18.123 --> 23:20.003
Except that was just in my dream.

23:20.043 --> 23:21.643
In fact, I was bullied horribly

23:21.683 --> 23:23.563
and shunned by all.
My mum had herself exorcised

23:23.603 --> 23:26.923
after the priest told her that the <i>Devil</i>
had visited her in the night

23:26.963 --> 23:29.163
and implanted the seed of a monster
in her womb.

23:29.203 --> 23:31.603
- Oh, Toby, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

23:31.643 --> 23:34.363
But then I heard that the village
of my dreams really did exist,

23:34.403 --> 23:36.683
that there was a place
I'd be welcomed and accepted,

23:36.723 --> 23:41.163
a world where people didn't judge you
for your gender or sexual preference,

23:41.203 --> 23:44.043
a place where everyone rejoiced
in the rich and varied tapestry

23:44.083 --> 23:45.443
of the human rainbow.

23:45.483 --> 23:48.043
- The <i>theatre</i>!
- Yes. The <i>theatre</i>!

23:49.203 --> 23:52.963
- You'd found your home.
- I like it here, Kate...

23:53.003 --> 23:54.423
with you.

24:02.043 --> 24:05.043
When beggars die,
there are no comets seen.

24:05.083 --> 24:07.603
The heavens themselves blaze forth
the death of princes.

24:07.643 --> 24:10.243
Cowards die many times
before their deaths.

24:10.283 --> 24:12.963
The valiant never taste of death but once.

24:13.003 --> 24:14.323
Oh, do not go forth today!

24:14.363 --> 24:17.123
He's so <i>good</i>.
Well done, Kate!

24:17.163 --> 24:18.603
Thanks, Mr Shakespeare.

24:18.643 --> 24:20.403
I <i>enjoyed</i> teaching him.

24:20.443 --> 24:22.963
Toby is such a sweet, sweet boy.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.683
Too showy, lacks depth.

24:24.723 --> 24:28.763
And also, curiously,
I don't find his breasts convincing.

24:28.803 --> 24:31.483
Look, though!
See, Greene hovers in the wings.

24:31.523 --> 24:34.043
He is come to cock my snook.

24:34.083 --> 24:37.843
But, verily,
'tis I who will snook his <i>cock</i>!

24:37.883 --> 24:39.643
Oh! Oh!
Argh!

24:39.683 --> 24:41.203
Arrghh!

24:41.243 --> 24:42.803
Et...

24:42.843 --> 24:44.483
...tu, Bru...

24:45.683 --> 24:47.043
...te!

24:49.073 --> 24:53.483
<i>Incredible</i> talent. He got a shout, a whisper,
a pause and a random emphasis

24:53.523 --> 24:55.083
into <i>four</i> syllables.

24:55.123 --> 24:57.883
A very <i>masterclass</i>
in Shakespearean acting.

24:57.923 --> 24:59.523
Ehhh!

25:02.083 --> 25:05.963
I am <i>closing</i> this theatre!

25:06.003 --> 25:09.203
All involved will be taken to the Tower.

25:09.243 --> 25:15.283
This play is naught
but a traitorous incitement to regicide.

25:15.323 --> 25:16.603
It isn't finished yet.

25:16.643 --> 25:19.083
- What?
- Didn't you read the rest?

25:19.123 --> 25:20.283
I'm sure I sent it you.

25:20.703 --> 25:21.763
The rest?

25:21.803 --> 25:25.043
Look, here.
Sorry... Spoiler alert!... Don't listen.

25:25.083 --> 25:27.683
Caesar's murderers
are first rejected by the mob,

25:27.723 --> 25:32.803
then hounded in battle and finally
fall upon their own swords in penance,

25:32.843 --> 25:36.403
which, I think you'll agree,
is <i>not</i> very traitorous at all.

25:37.563 --> 25:39.323
Betray-ed...

25:39.363 --> 25:40.803
Betray-ed.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.923
Et tu, Shakespeare!

25:47.203 --> 25:49.563
The play may proceed!
Pah!

25:50.923 --> 25:52.563
A <i>hit</i>!
Verily a hit!

25:52.603 --> 25:54.883
The box office goeth bonkers.

25:54.923 --> 25:56.443
Ahem.
Hello, everybody.

25:56.483 --> 25:59.323
Um, I just wanted to say...
I couldn't be happier.

25:59.363 --> 26:01.883
Not just cos I've found my true home
in the theatre...

26:01.923 --> 26:03.243
Well said!

26:03.283 --> 26:07.803
...but also because Miss Kate has asked me
to be her husband.

26:07.843 --> 26:09.803
Oh...

26:09.843 --> 26:11.123
Blimey.

26:11.163 --> 26:12.963
Oh-ho!
You did it, Kate.

26:13.003 --> 26:16.163
You actually found a man
in touch with his female side.

26:16.203 --> 26:18.803
Congratulations to you both.

26:18.843 --> 26:21.083
Toby, might I have a word?

26:21.123 --> 26:24.363
There's an Italian gentleman outside
I'd like you to meet.

26:24.403 --> 26:26.883
Oh.
I shan't be a moment, my love.

26:30.163 --> 26:33.243
Katie, are you sure about this,
considering...?

26:33.283 --> 26:35.883
Toby is a man by <i>law</i>,
Mr Shakespeare.

26:35.923 --> 26:38.723
A very sweet and gentle man.

26:38.763 --> 26:41.963
I need a husband,
Toby needs kindness and protection.

26:42.003 --> 26:44.003
But, Kate, what of love?

26:44.043 --> 26:47.083
In our exclusively patriarchal society,

26:47.123 --> 26:50.643
a woman is lucky indeed
if she is able to marry for love.

26:50.683 --> 26:52.603
I am happy to marry for friendship.

26:52.643 --> 26:53.803
Kate!

26:53.843 --> 26:56.203
Kate!
You won't believe it!

26:56.243 --> 27:00.083
Mr Condell arranged for a casting scout
from the Commedia Dell'Arte

27:00.123 --> 27:03.043
to attend the play,
and they <i>want</i> me!

27:03.083 --> 27:04.883
I leave for Italy tonight!

27:04.923 --> 27:06.803
Toby...

27:06.843 --> 27:08.163
What of our engagement?

27:08.203 --> 27:09.643
Oh...

27:11.083 --> 27:12.403
Um...

27:12.443 --> 27:14.763
Oh, I guess that's...
sort of off.

27:14.803 --> 27:18.083
Kate, I'm...
going to be big in Italy.

27:19.043 --> 27:20.563
I need to pack.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.523
Lesson learned, Miss Kate.

27:25.563 --> 27:28.683
Toby may be a boy,
or he may be a girl,

27:28.723 --> 27:31.203
and he may choose to be <i>neither</i>,

27:31.243 --> 27:34.283
but, above all, he <i>is</i> an actor.

27:34.323 --> 27:38.883
And an actor will always, <i>always</i>
take the better offer.

27:41.163 --> 27:42.603
Betrayed.

27:42.643 --> 27:44.003
Betrayed.

27:44.043 --> 27:45.723
Et tu, Toby.

27:49.603 --> 27:52.723
It really is outrageous
that women be not allowed to act.

27:52.763 --> 27:55.523
Kate would be brilliant,
if only it were legal.

27:55.563 --> 27:58.563
Well, it wouldn't do her much good
in Julius Caesar, would it?

27:58.603 --> 27:59.883
What do you mean, my sweet?

27:59.923 --> 28:04.043
Well, there are only two women's parts in
it and both of them are absolute crappage.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.163
Particularly Calpurnia.

28:06.203 --> 28:07.843
Oh, you noticed that, did you?

28:07.883 --> 28:09.363
Oh, just a bit!

28:09.403 --> 28:13.443
She gets one tiny scene and all she does
is talk about her husband.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.203
Well, give it time, my love.

28:15.243 --> 28:19.083
One day there'll be as many decent parts
for women as there are for men.

28:19.123 --> 28:24.963
Then perhaps will finally come a script
in which women get the last word.

28:27.943 --> 28:29.533
Kind of doubt it.
