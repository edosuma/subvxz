WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.834
Previously on Mech-X4.

00:05.959 --> 00:08.125
Hurt locker!

00:08.208 --> 00:11.375
(Ryan) So Mark wants to play pranks.
I can play pranks.

00:11.458 --> 00:13.125
(Ryan) Something's wrong
with my powers!

00:14.208 --> 00:15.834
(Harris) The fourth person
is a mechanic.

00:15.917 --> 00:17.917
-How about your brother?
-No, anybody else.

00:19.959 --> 00:21.083
(screams)

00:21.166 --> 00:22.500
(growls)

00:22.583 --> 00:26.208
Cassie Park, streaming live
on Gramogram. Are you seeing this?

00:29.166 --> 00:31.166
Brothers and teammates.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.500
I'm adopted?

00:40.834 --> 00:41.792
Where did you find this?

00:42.834 --> 00:44.417
Principal Grey had a box,

00:44.500 --> 00:46.250
all of her surveillance on me.

00:48.834 --> 00:49.917
I'm adopted.

00:51.417 --> 00:54.166
Wow. That's pretty cool.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.500
It is?

00:56.583 --> 00:57.792
Yeah.

00:57.875 --> 01:01.750
That means I don't have
to hang out with you anymore.

01:01.834 --> 01:04.709
I don't have to be in the robot
with you anymore.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.917
This changes everything.

01:10.417 --> 01:12.917
Wait. What are you saying?
We're not brothers anymore?

01:14.208 --> 01:15.625
Were we ever?

01:29.166 --> 01:31.625
No! No, no!

01:31.709 --> 01:33.333
No!

01:33.417 --> 01:35.041
(chuckles)

01:35.125 --> 01:37.208
You wanted to tell me
something, dingus?

01:37.291 --> 01:42.041
Uh, yeah. Mom said
I get to pick the movie for tonight.

01:42.125 --> 01:46.000
Seriously? That's the "something
important" you needed to tell me?

01:47.417 --> 01:49.125
Weirdo. All right.

01:58.333 --> 02:00.750
(theme music playing)

02:19.625 --> 02:21.834
(Harris) So, you and Mark aren't
blood relatives?

02:21.917 --> 02:24.709
Maybe that's why you have powers
and he doesn't.

02:24.792 --> 02:25.917
Dude.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.917
Yo. Maybe you have powers

02:28.000 --> 02:29.583
-'cause you're from another planet.
-Dude!

02:29.667 --> 02:31.583
Hey, are you gonna
talk to your mom about this?

02:31.667 --> 02:32.792
Oh, are you gonna tell Mark?

02:32.875 --> 02:34.041
Dudes, chill!

02:34.125 --> 02:36.834
Uh, you can't really scream "chill"
and expect people to chill.

02:36.917 --> 02:38.834
See, it doesn't really
work like that.

02:39.834 --> 02:41.291
I'm not gonna tell Mark.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.709
And my mom's away
for the weekend,

02:43.792 --> 02:45.291
and Mark has this big game
coming up.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.500
I'll just wait till
the time is right, okay?

02:47.583 --> 02:49.792
But just for now, you two.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.667
(scoffs) "Oh, no,
I'm adopted." I'm fine.

02:56.750 --> 03:00.625
Ryan, if you need a friend
to talk to, talk to Harris.

03:00.709 --> 03:03.333
I'm sort of an idiot,
and I will say the wrong thing.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.750
Okay, bud.

03:04.834 --> 03:05.792
Yeah.

03:05.875 --> 03:07.208
Man, adopted!

03:07.291 --> 03:08.792
Who'd have guessed?

03:20.792 --> 03:21.917
(knocks)

03:22.917 --> 03:24.792
Oh, Mr. Harper, hi.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.834
Cassie P at Gramogram.
EveryVid, yeah.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.291
Love your work.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.750
Then why did you ignore every interview
request for the last three years?

03:32.834 --> 03:34.542
Uh... (chuckles)

03:34.625 --> 03:37.500
Well, teenager. Billionaire.

03:37.583 --> 03:40.417
Whoops. But hey, that was before
you broke the Mech-X4 story,

03:40.500 --> 03:45.792
so I figured why not have Bay city's best
digital reporter announce my scholarship:

03:45.875 --> 03:48.166
The Harper Grant
for Young Futurists.

03:49.959 --> 03:52.125
-Hm.
-Got a nice ring to it, right?

03:53.834 --> 03:57.583
Anybody can have an idea
that changes the world.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.959
Is this, uh... Is this where you guys
are doing the interviews?

04:00.834 --> 04:02.375
Almost anybody.

04:02.458 --> 04:03.667
(Cassie)
Probably not that kid.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.166
Right?

04:05.250 --> 04:06.792
All of your words
are hurtful.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.500
Well...

04:09.583 --> 04:12.417
(Cassie) So, the Harper Grant
is being announced

04:12.500 --> 04:14.750
after the big game.
Nervous?

04:14.834 --> 04:16.417
Nah, I don't do nervous.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.792
All my focus is on
the game and the team.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.667
(Cassie) That's it? No interests
outside of sports?

04:24.750 --> 04:26.583
No outside activities?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.667
Nope, no outside activities.

04:28.750 --> 04:33.375
And honestly, it's been nice just being
Mark Walker, most awesome again.

04:33.458 --> 04:34.667
(Cassie)
Wow.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.125
Yeah. I hear that a lot.

04:37.208 --> 04:40.041
(Harris) To be safe, we should put
the robot through a few tests today.

04:41.250 --> 04:42.792
Why isn't Mark here?

04:42.875 --> 04:44.208
Well, he's doing Mark stuff.

04:44.291 --> 04:46.375
We need to make sure when
the X-weapon drained your power,

04:46.458 --> 04:47.583
it didn't short anything else.

04:47.667 --> 04:49.583
But do we have
to do that now?

04:49.667 --> 04:52.792
It's been like a week since we kicked
that fake principal's butt.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.542
I'm way behind
on my doing nothing.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.750
Ah, man, I missed this.

04:58.834 --> 05:02.750
Guys, just because we beat the principal
doesn't mean that the threat is over.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.709
We're Mech-X4, okay?

05:04.792 --> 05:05.834
We need to be ready.

05:05.917 --> 05:07.667
Then Mark
should be here.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.792
You haven't said
anything yet. Have you?

05:14.667 --> 05:15.834
(Harris)
What was that?

05:17.125 --> 05:19.917
Uh, Mech Execute!

05:22.000 --> 05:23.625
Plasma cannon?

05:23.709 --> 05:25.083
Plasma cannon awesome.

05:27.583 --> 05:28.542
Whoo!

05:28.625 --> 05:29.583
Shields?

05:29.667 --> 05:30.875
Good to go, son.

05:30.959 --> 05:32.750
Rocket jump.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.208
-(cheering)
-All right!

05:39.959 --> 05:41.667
(Spyder)
Nice!

05:41.750 --> 05:44.000
We can totally pilot
this robot with three people.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.375
Whoa!

05:47.792 --> 05:50.333
(all grunting)

05:50.417 --> 05:52.667
-(grunts)
-Spyder, you okay?

05:52.750 --> 05:55.125
-Yeah, I'm good.
-Mark will always be apart of this team.

05:55.208 --> 05:57.166
We need four pilots
to pilot Mech-X4.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.500
Why would you say
we only need three?

05:59.583 --> 06:02.542
Three, four... you know
I'm bad at math.

06:02.625 --> 06:05.083
-(machine beeping)
-Hey, what's up with the left thruster?

06:05.166 --> 06:06.792
Something is wrong.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.834
-With the robot.
-With your powers.

06:08.917 --> 06:10.542
With my chair.

06:10.625 --> 06:13.250
The recliner's broken.
How am I going to do my nothing now?

06:14.500 --> 06:16.250
Harris, my powers are fine.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.875
And I get the X-weapon
drains my powers,

06:18.959 --> 06:23.000
but if it keeps on messing up the robot
everytime we use it, it has to go.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.208
(sighs)

06:27.667 --> 06:30.667
(Cassie) So I'm told you already applied
for the Harper Grant.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.083
Ha, you bet.

06:32.166 --> 06:34.583
The chance to walk alongside
Seth Harper,

06:34.667 --> 06:36.000
learn from him,

06:36.083 --> 06:37.917
maybe take a peak inside
of his sock drawer.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.834
Oh, I bet he has
amazing socks.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.333
Where was I?

06:42.417 --> 06:43.959
(Cassie)
Harper Grant.

06:44.041 --> 06:45.709
Right, right.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.000
But seriously,

06:47.083 --> 06:48.792
do you think he's an argyle guy?

06:48.875 --> 06:51.792
Or does he go sockless
with a horsebit loafer?

06:52.792 --> 06:55.417
(chattering)

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
Do a little bit
of this.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.291
I'll do some of this.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.750
And with two seconds left,
close down with... this.

07:02.834 --> 07:03.917
Whoo!

07:04.000 --> 07:05.625
(chanting)
Mark, Mark, Mark!

07:05.709 --> 07:08.542
Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark!
Mark, Mark!

07:08.625 --> 07:11.000
Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark!

07:15.250 --> 07:17.417
You'll notice teach,
I hit the recycling bin

07:17.500 --> 07:19.166
because tomorrow against Bay City East,

07:19.250 --> 07:21.625
-varsity will be...
-(Both) Taking out the trash.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.959
Bro!

07:24.291 --> 07:25.709
(laughing)
Yeah.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.959
Then, the fireworks will go off.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.125
Scoreboard blasts
"Bay City rocks!"

07:32.208 --> 07:34.834
Music blares and then
we all do a victory dance.

07:34.917 --> 07:36.291
(cheering)

07:36.375 --> 07:38.375
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

07:38.458 --> 07:39.875
Too bad we don't
have two of you.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.709
Even if we did,
I'd be better than the other one.

07:42.750 --> 07:43.875
Nothing but net!

07:44.917 --> 07:46.333
-(bell rings)
-Whoa.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.709
(high-pitched ringing)

07:50.792 --> 07:52.792
He meant to do that,
by the way.

07:53.875 --> 07:54.875
Varsity!

07:56.417 --> 07:58.375
I hope you're better than that
at the big game.

07:58.458 --> 07:59.875
(Mark)
I'm sorry.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.542
-What was that?
-What was what?

08:04.625 --> 08:07.917
Your techno-mindy stuff.
The lights, bells.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.417
Are you trying to embarrass me
in front of everyone?

08:10.500 --> 08:12.792
Hey! No, Ryan wouldn't do that.
Ryan's a great brother.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.458
You're lucky he's even
part of your family.

08:14.542 --> 08:15.750
What are you talking about?

08:15.834 --> 08:17.834
He's not talking about anything.

08:17.917 --> 08:19.166
Okay?

08:20.417 --> 08:21.542
(clears throat)

08:22.917 --> 08:23.959
I gotta go.

08:24.875 --> 08:28.000
Seriously, just let me
concentrate on the game.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.667
The monsters are probably gone.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.625
Let's just... do our own stuff.

08:44.834 --> 08:45.709
(gasps)

08:47.709 --> 08:49.083
Still think you're okay?

08:55.417 --> 08:57.875
I'm telling you, the X-weapon
did something to me.

08:57.959 --> 08:59.458
Everything seems fine.

08:59.542 --> 09:04.000
Oh, fine is it? Yeah. Well, maybe
you can tell that to my phone, Harris.

09:04.083 --> 09:05.667
I still had data.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.041
I just... I can't believe Mark, man.

09:08.125 --> 09:11.291
The minute it seems like we don't need
to fight as a team anymore,

09:11.375 --> 09:13.041
poof, back to his jerk friends.

09:13.125 --> 09:14.667
(gasps)

09:14.750 --> 09:16.041
Oh.

09:16.125 --> 09:17.625
What?

09:17.709 --> 09:21.500
Well, when you were talking about Mark,
your powers spiked just a bit.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.875
(scoffs) No, no that had
to be something else.

09:25.417 --> 09:26.709
Yeah.

09:26.792 --> 09:29.000
I mean,

09:29.083 --> 09:31.667
why would Mark want to hang out
with a bunch of freshmen?

09:32.709 --> 09:34.959
-He already has a team.
-Yeah, us!

09:35.959 --> 09:37.709
Aha! See, a spike.

09:37.792 --> 09:40.792
Whatever's bugging you about Mark
is making your powers go wonky.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.208
You're wrong, Harris.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.750
Oh, no, you did not.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.542
Ryan, don't say it.
Do not say it.

09:46.625 --> 09:47.792
Y'all heard me.

09:47.875 --> 09:51.417
You... are... wrong.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.583
(gasps)

09:53.959 --> 09:56.875
Well, then, good day.

09:56.959 --> 09:59.125
That is the harshest thing
you've ever said to him.

09:59.208 --> 10:00.583
Harris, he didn't mean it!
Come back!

10:05.750 --> 10:07.792
(door opens)

10:07.875 --> 10:10.000
Dude, I promised Mom we'd both
be home by dinner.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.458
You were supposed to be here hours ago.

10:11.542 --> 10:12.917
And you were supposed to be
at the robot.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.792
But I guess we're doing
our own thing now, right?

10:14.875 --> 10:17.417
Did you actually know Spyder
got a tattoo on his face

10:17.500 --> 10:19.375
of a dragon riding a unicorn?

10:19.458 --> 10:21.166
-Really?
-No.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.834
But the fact you don't know
shows you don't care.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.500
What? I care.

10:25.583 --> 10:26.750
Come on, Ry.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.041
-(knocking)
-Room service.

10:31.834 --> 10:34.792
Okay, it's not really room service,
but your mom sort of wanted me

10:34.875 --> 10:37.125
to check in on you guys
until she gets back tomorrow.

10:37.208 --> 10:38.709
So, she doesn't trust us.

10:38.792 --> 10:40.542
(sighs) You know, I think
it's more of a

10:40.625 --> 10:41.959
"How much do I trust
Harper?" thing.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.125
-Hm.
-(phone rings)

10:43.208 --> 10:44.417
Ah, you gonna take that?

10:45.625 --> 10:46.875
Dane!

10:46.959 --> 10:48.083
My man, what's up?

10:48.166 --> 10:49.792
(chuckles)

10:51.542 --> 10:53.083
Cool. All right.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.583
Gonna... So you...

10:55.667 --> 10:58.417
And that is how
you clear a room. Okay.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.333
Hey, you mind if I...

11:02.417 --> 11:06.542
(video game beeping)

11:06.625 --> 11:09.750
So, player two's got other things
on his mind, huh?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.750
You know, if you, um,

11:12.834 --> 11:14.500
if you had read my biography...

11:14.583 --> 11:15.834
-Dude!
-Listen to my podcast?

11:15.917 --> 11:17.250
-No.
-No? Ugh!

11:17.333 --> 11:18.750
I need better media impact.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.667
Look, all I'm saying is

11:20.750 --> 11:22.834
I don't have a brother, but...

11:23.792 --> 11:26.792
my college roommate was
like a brother to me.

11:26.875 --> 11:28.000
Was?

11:28.083 --> 11:31.500
Yeah, we had a disagreement
awhile back. Adult stuff.

11:31.583 --> 11:34.291
-Snooze! Snooze.
-Right. Right, right.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.875
Anyway, all I'm saying is...

11:36.959 --> 11:39.834
You know, maybe you
and your brother are like this.

11:39.917 --> 11:42.875
But just now,
you're more like this.

11:42.959 --> 11:46.000
But this, it's just now,
it's not always gonna be like that.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.583
Yeah, but what if now stinks?

11:47.667 --> 11:51.875
Well, do your best
to make a better tomorrow.

11:53.458 --> 11:57.125
And buckle up because I invented this game
and I am going to crush you.

11:57.208 --> 11:59.709
-Whoa.
-Oh! You're toast already.

11:59.792 --> 12:01.792
That was like...
That was a record, I think.

12:01.875 --> 12:04.000
Okay, what about eyes closed?

12:04.083 --> 12:05.959
(Announcer) Here we are
at the 27th annual matchup

12:06.041 --> 12:08.375
between the Bay City Llamas
and the Bay City East Badgers.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.375
I don't want to say
these two teams hate each other

12:10.458 --> 12:12.208
but wow, they hate each other.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.500
And there's the ball.
And Walker has it.

12:14.583 --> 12:15.959
(cheering)

12:17.250 --> 12:18.792
Whoo! Go Mark!

12:20.959 --> 12:22.125
Weird.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.333
What's that?

12:23.417 --> 12:24.792
Ryan cheering Mark like that.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.125
You know, it's nice
he's being so supportive.

12:27.208 --> 12:30.875
Oh! Euro-step!
I see you. Okay, Let's go.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.333
Oh. Well, you know,
I don't want to brag,

12:33.417 --> 12:34.959
but I might have said
something to him.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.041
Oh.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.709
If you break her heart,
I will end you.

12:43.583 --> 12:46.583
(cheering)

12:49.750 --> 12:50.750
Yeah!

12:52.083 --> 12:53.625
♪ Hey, hey! ♪

12:54.709 --> 12:56.959
(cheering)

12:58.959 --> 13:02.625
(Cheerleaders) Double-L-A-M-A-S!
Go Llamas! Go Llamas!

13:02.709 --> 13:03.959
Go Llamas! Go Llamas!

13:04.041 --> 13:05.333
Whoo!

13:07.083 --> 13:09.834
(Cassie) Look, if you're going
to keep staring at me,

13:09.917 --> 13:11.709
this interview's over.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.417
Okay. Okay.

13:14.959 --> 13:15.959
Get out.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.583
(Announcer)
It's 88 to 86,

13:18.667 --> 13:20.917
and here come the East Badgers.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.625
Johnson shoots, misses.

13:22.709 --> 13:24.125
(cheering)

13:24.208 --> 13:27.583
Ball retrieved by the Llamas,
and here comes Mark Walker.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.667
(Crowd)
Llamas! Llamas!

13:29.750 --> 13:32.000
Walker, with the pass.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.333
And back to Walker.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.583
(Crowd)
Llamas! Llamas!

13:35.667 --> 13:36.792
Take the shot, bro!

13:36.875 --> 13:39.000
He's not your bro,
stop calling him your bro.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.291
10 seconds left on the clock.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.000
Walker dishes it off.

13:44.208 --> 13:45.583
Back to Walker.

13:46.583 --> 13:47.917
Go, bro, go!

13:48.000 --> 13:49.333
He's not your bro!

13:49.417 --> 13:51.291
-(high-pitched ringing)
- Mark Walker shoots...

13:51.375 --> 13:54.792
(high-pitched ringing)

14:04.250 --> 14:06.375
And misses.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.583
Bay City High loses.

14:08.667 --> 14:11.041
One thing is for sure,
that was not awesome.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.333
Good game, guys.
Good game.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.875
Whoo!

14:16.792 --> 14:18.583
Ryan!

14:18.667 --> 14:20.333
Ryan.

14:20.417 --> 14:22.041
Dude, that techno-surge
was huge.

14:22.125 --> 14:23.291
We got to get
a handle on this.

14:23.375 --> 14:24.667
-I know.
-What is wrong with you?

14:24.750 --> 14:27.750
I'm just angry about
all these freak blackouts we're having.

14:27.834 --> 14:28.875
We lost.

14:28.959 --> 14:30.750
You made me lose.

14:30.834 --> 14:33.125
I'm a Walker.
Walkers do not lose.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.875
Well, you're losing
your temper right now.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.500
You're not gonna joke your way
out of this.

14:37.583 --> 14:38.959
(beeping)

14:39.041 --> 14:40.917
Monster alert.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.917
It's the other half of Octaconda.
I always wondered where it went.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.959
Guys, it's headed
for the school.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.041
Let's go!

14:47.875 --> 14:49.291
Just get this over with.

14:49.375 --> 14:50.625
-(door opens)
-(sighs)

14:52.583 --> 14:54.959
Dude, it's the other half
of that worm. Piece of cake.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.542
That thing almost squished me.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.000
Didn't say it was good cake.

15:07.041 --> 15:09.000
Mech Execute!

15:10.041 --> 15:11.875
(alarm blaring)

15:15.291 --> 15:17.208
Mech Execute!

15:25.500 --> 15:29.125
-Mech...
-Ryan.

15:29.208 --> 15:32.458
Look, I'm not gonna spill your secrets,
but people are in danger.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.750
You know why this is happening.

15:37.875 --> 15:39.709
It's bad enough
we lost the game.

15:39.792 --> 15:40.959
Now we're gonna
lose the school?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.208
Dude, lay off.
You don't know.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.250
Okay, what's goin' on?

15:52.875 --> 15:54.542
What's this?

15:54.625 --> 15:56.208
It's proof.

15:56.291 --> 15:59.667
It makes sense,
why you're you and I'm me.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.208
What are you talking about?

16:04.917 --> 16:06.542
I'm adopted.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.000
I'm not your brother.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.792
Wait, what?

16:21.875 --> 16:24.750
When we beat the principal,
I found a bunch of stuff.

16:24.834 --> 16:27.959
I found documents, papers,
and proof that I'm adopted.

16:28.041 --> 16:30.583
I didn't know.
Mom didn't tell me.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.208
(laughs)

16:35.291 --> 16:38.083
Oh, man, is that what
this was all about?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.792
What are you...
What are you doing?

16:42.875 --> 16:44.709
Hugging you, you idiot.

16:44.792 --> 16:47.625
I thought you were turning into the Ryan
who dumpster dumped me with his powers.

16:47.709 --> 16:50.834
-That jerk.
-Well, I couldn't control my powers.

16:50.917 --> 16:52.333
Because...

16:54.792 --> 16:56.583
Because if we weren't really brothers,

16:56.667 --> 16:58.750
I thought you wouldn't want to be
on a team with us.

16:58.834 --> 17:01.125
Because I liked being
on a team with you

17:01.208 --> 17:03.125
and every time
I thought about that,

17:03.208 --> 17:05.166
my powers, they got all weird.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.959
-And if we're not even brothers...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude, stop.

17:08.041 --> 17:11.959
First of all, we're brothers.
We're family.

17:12.041 --> 17:15.000
We're not just Team Mech-X4.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.834
We're Team Walker.

17:17.917 --> 17:20.458
So if that's what's going on
in that weirdo head of yours,

17:20.542 --> 17:21.750
knock it off.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.834
And get in the game.
You're a Walker.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.959
And Walkers do not lose.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.250
Well, you gonna say it, bro?

17:38.083 --> 17:41.250
(sighs) Mech Execute!

17:51.458 --> 17:55.333
Yeah, weird, right? The robot just
showed up and kicked that thing's butt.

17:55.417 --> 17:56.709
Pretty cool.

17:56.792 --> 17:58.458
(Cassie)
Wish I got a video of that.

17:58.542 --> 17:59.875
Ah, you were busy.

17:59.959 --> 18:02.166
But I'll tell you what, when your video
about the grant is done,

18:02.250 --> 18:05.333
send it to me and I will link it
to every Harp Phone in the world.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.041
It's the least I could do.

18:09.542 --> 18:11.542
-(Cassie) Please go.
-Aww.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.709
Yeah, we lost the game,
but who cares?

18:14.792 --> 18:16.917
That robot saved everybody.

18:19.709 --> 18:20.875
Yes!

18:22.000 --> 18:23.333
Yes!

18:25.417 --> 18:27.375
Ah!

18:35.375 --> 18:38.583
And personally, I like to think I'm an MVP
when it comes to a lot of things.

18:38.667 --> 18:43.083
Basketball, baseball, football,
and being a brother.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.417
(Cassie) What does this have to do
with the Harper Grant?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.500
Were we talking about
the Harper Grant?

18:48.583 --> 18:51.375
And seriously, MVP
at "being a brother"?

18:51.458 --> 18:52.667
Kinda cheesy?

18:52.750 --> 18:53.917
Can we get rid of that?

18:54.000 --> 18:54.959
No.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.959
-(Cassie) Hey!
-(Ryan chuckles)

19:06.166 --> 19:08.458
So how did you find out?

19:08.542 --> 19:10.834
Well, Harris, he was doing
this science fair experiment

19:10.917 --> 19:15.625
about DNA and figured out
Mark and I weren't biologically related.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.333
Why didn't you say anything?

19:17.417 --> 19:20.834
I didn't know what to say
or how to explain it, I...

19:20.917 --> 19:22.709
I guess I didn't want you
to feel different.

19:22.792 --> 19:27.000
No, I did. For, like, a minute.
But now I don't.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.667
-I'm sorry, honey.
-For what?

19:29.750 --> 19:30.834
Being my mom?

19:30.917 --> 19:32.875
I mean, I like
the bigger room now, but...

19:32.959 --> 19:35.125
(chuckles)

19:35.208 --> 19:39.458
Okay, well this is, um,
everything I have from the adoption.

19:39.542 --> 19:41.208
Hm?

19:41.291 --> 19:44.375
Uh... Oh!

19:44.458 --> 19:49.750
Oh. I don't know who wrote this note,
but I always liked the named Ryan.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.792
We can talk about this
anytime you want. Okay?

19:54.875 --> 19:55.917
Cool.

19:56.959 --> 19:58.834
And you know what
the best part is?

19:58.917 --> 20:00.792
Is now we don't have
any more secrets.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.458
Okay? Come here.

20:07.417 --> 20:09.709
Okay, so why don't I make some dinner.
What do you feel like?

20:09.792 --> 20:12.125
-Ice cream.
-Oh, salad it is.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.375
(Ryan)
See?

20:30.458 --> 20:32.208
Whoa, perfect fit.

20:32.291 --> 20:33.375
Exact handwriting.

20:33.458 --> 20:36.000
So this guy knew I'd be
a technopath

20:36.083 --> 20:39.333
and built this robot for me...

20:39.417 --> 20:43.000
but he was also the same guy
that anonymously

20:43.083 --> 20:45.291
delivered me to the adoption agency.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.375
And then Mom adopted you?

20:47.458 --> 20:51.208
Yeah, but she had zero idea
about any of this stuff.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.834
What does it all mean?

20:52.917 --> 20:56.667
Well, this Leo guy knew I had powers
when I was a baby.

20:57.834 --> 20:59.458
He probably knew
my birth parents.

21:00.709 --> 21:02.375
You know what,
we need answers.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.458
We need to figure out
who this guy is

21:04.542 --> 21:06.750
and how and why
I got my powers.

21:08.625 --> 21:09.792
So we're playing offense.

21:10.917 --> 21:12.333
Well, I'm a Walker, aren't I?

21:13.375 --> 21:14.709
Let's go to work.

21:20.959 --> 21:23.959
(theme music playing)
