WEBVTT

01:07.526 --> 01:10.325
All right. Fucking...

01:10.487 --> 01:12.660
I have to talk to Uncle Ray.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.791
Wait, you guys, wait. No running, okay?

01:14.950 --> 01:16.952
Let's go!
- Wait... All right, wait a minute.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.713
No running!
Sit down on the dock, okay?

01:20.747 --> 01:21.964
No.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.178
- Ow! Hey! What the hell?
- Do you like that?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.589
- Cut it out. What's wrong?
- Does that feel good?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.928
What the hell are you doing?
Knock it off.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.311
- Whats the matter. Cut that out!
- You can't go around hitting people.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.268
He had to go to the emergency room.
What's wrong with you?

01:37.431 --> 01:39.354
Shouldn't have been
messing with my wife.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.359
She's not your wife anymore!

01:41.518 --> 01:43.566
You big dumb whore!

01:43.729 --> 01:45.481
And now you fucked us.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.649
You totally... You totally fucked us.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.159
What are you talking about?

01:49.318 --> 01:53.368
<i>- He had it coming.
- You damaged the merchandise.</i>

01:53.530 --> 01:56.374
<i>The clients are complaining.
They're canceling left and right.</i>

01:58.702 --> 02:00.704
He knew who she was.
Who the hell are they?

02:00.871 --> 02:03.590
- They're Charlie's.
- Where's Charlie?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.920
Look, don't...
Don't worry about Charlie, okay?

02:07.085 --> 02:08.553
Worry about yourself.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.303
Did you know he had five new clients?

02:15.636 --> 02:18.606
Business was booming
till you broke his nose.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.607
- Okay, put me in.
- Put you in?

02:20.766 --> 02:23.360
I can't put you in.
They're not your clients.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.145
He's 20 years younger than you.

02:25.312 --> 02:29.488
I've forgotten more about fucking
than that guy will ever learn.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.153
Okay? Put me in!

02:32.319 --> 02:34.413
Hey, guys! Guys. Put... No.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.573
Put down the rocks
and sit down on the dock!

02:36.740 --> 02:39.243
I'm counting to three. One, two...

02:46.583 --> 02:50.429
- What's this?
- It's a wedding invitation.

02:50.587 --> 02:54.308
Wha...? But Frances and Mike
are getting married?

02:54.466 --> 02:58.721
That's what it looks like, Tanya.
That's why they sent out the invitations.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.062
Why didn't I get one?

03:06.144 --> 03:09.114
You don't know them as well as I do.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.775
We-ll... No.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.324
What are you talking about?

03:14.486 --> 03:16.659
I'm the one responsible
for their happiness.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.950
All right, I wouldn't take it that far,
Tanya.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.414
But I'm the one.
I wouldn't take no for an answer.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.544
I told Frances, "Open your heart."

03:23.704 --> 03:24.876
Yeah, but you're also...

03:25.038 --> 03:27.757
- You stole money from them.
- I did not steal. How dare you?

03:27.916 --> 03:29.463
You know I paid back every penny.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.095
- What are you talking about?
- Tanya.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.131
You're a pimp, Okay?

03:34.297 --> 03:36.345
Pimps don't get invited to weddings.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.181
Face the facts.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.807
Oh, yeah.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.976
You know, it says "and guest.“

03:47.352 --> 03:49.946
I mean, I could be your guest. Heh.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.357
What? Come on.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.823
I was kind of gonna invite Jessica.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.995
God, Ray, what is wrong with you?

03:58.155 --> 03:59.577
What? You wouldn't help.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.458
I'm trying to get something going.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.916
Ray. God!
You're not in high school anymore!

04:05.078 --> 04:07.922
- She's not gonna say yes.
- How do you know?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.459
Yeah okay, you know what?
Fine. Go ahead, go.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.673
Fine. You fucking take Jessica...

04:12.836 --> 04:16.339
because I don't care.
I mean, I hate weddings anyway.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.976
They're fucking misogynistic,
antiquated bullshit.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.934
- Okay.
- Guys, come on. We're leaving.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.935
<i>Tanya was pissed,
but we had a business to run.</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:30.399
<i>It was time to plant my ﬂag in the sand.</i>

04:30.562 --> 04:34.863
<i>One man's injury is
another man's 600 bucks.</i>

04:37.152 --> 04:38.199
Oh.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.951
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.162
So, what happened to Jake?

04:45.535 --> 04:47.663
Jake's out of commission
for a little while.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.083
Oh. So you're the other guy?

04:51.666 --> 04:55.216
No. I'm the first guy.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.257
So we have an hour, right?

04:59.132 --> 05:03.353
- There's no rush.
- With Jake I always had to hurry.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.310
Well, I'm not Jake.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.732
I like to go slow.

05:12.479 --> 05:16.029
I always thought you were handsome
when Tanya brought you guys out.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.285
It's just that, I don't know...

05:18.443 --> 05:20.116
I thought Jake was so cute.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.205
Babies are cute.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.582
Puppies are cute.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.168
I'm not cute.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.969
Richard, Richard.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.758
That was great.

05:43.134 --> 05:47.890
Well, I hope I didn't disappoint,
you know, with the Jake of it all.

05:48.765 --> 05:49.766
Who?

05:49.933 --> 05:51.150
<i>Jason.</i>

05:51.309 --> 05:54.404
<i>I should've punched him
in the nose the day we met.</i>

05:55.105 --> 05:58.951
Charlie. Charlie, where are you?
Where is Missy?

05:59.109 --> 06:00.326
When are you coming back?

06:00.986 --> 06:04.081
Charlie, you know, I have your children.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.167
Okay, guys, guys.
Okay, let's wind it down, okay?

06:10.328 --> 06:12.001
Let's wind it down. Wind-down time?

06:12.163 --> 06:14.632
We're winding down.
It's wind-down time! Okay.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.010
Oh, Jesus Christ, help me.
Where the fuck is it?

06:17.168 --> 06:19.591
I'm gonna go higher than you!
- It's story time.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.848
We're gonna have story time.
It's story time.

06:22.007 --> 06:25.853
Okay, you guys, we're gonna...
I'm counting to three. One, two, three.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.771
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.358
Okay, um, let's see.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.522
<i>The Velveteen Rabbit.</i>

06:38.440 --> 06:41.068
Okay,
"There once was a velveteen rabbit...

06:41.234 --> 06:43.737
and in the beginning,
he was really splendid.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.032
He was fat and bunchy,
as a rabbit should be.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.416
His coat was spotted brown and white...

06:48.575 --> 06:51.579
and his ears were lined
with pink sateen.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.591
On Christmas morning, when he sat
wedged in the top of the boy's stocking...

06:55.749 --> 06:57.968
with a sprig of holly
between his paws...

06:58.126 --> 07:01.175
- ...the effect was charming."
- I saw a rabbit once.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.716
Yeah, me too. I like rabbits.

07:03.882 --> 07:07.557
"There were other things in the stocking,
nuts and oranges and a toy engine...

07:07.719 --> 07:09.596
and chocolate almonds..."

07:09.763 --> 07:11.640
Okay, Damester... Stentorian!

07:11.806 --> 07:13.774
Yelling won't help. I'm not deaf.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.982
"Stentorian“ means
extremely loud or booming.

07:18.063 --> 07:21.033
- Damon, you ready?
- Hey! Hey, Jess.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.285
Come on in. I made coffee.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.491
- No, we gotta go.
- I got coffee cake.

07:25.654 --> 07:29.124
- Good for you.
- All right.

07:29.282 --> 07:33.378
Damester, I got time for one more.
Let's do it. Let's do "simian."

07:33.536 --> 07:35.209
Come on, Damester, "simian."

07:42.253 --> 07:43.971
- Simian!
- This whole thing's retarded.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.428
This test was invented by the Nazis.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.595
Okay. Okay, uh... Uh... Do good!

07:49.761 --> 07:52.105
Do the best you can do,
that's what you can.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.686
Okay. Good. All right.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.601
They're good kids, Jess.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.530
Maybe not the brightest,
but we did good.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.408
What? I'm joking.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.991
Hey, it was a joke. Come on.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.247
I'm funny, remember? I make you laugh.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.875
- Since when do you make me laugh?
- Oh, come on.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.125
Look.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.037
I'm a monkey named simian.

08:19.290 --> 08:23.170
Where are you going? I thought
we were gonna drop them off together.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.720
You snooped into my personal life,
you showed up where you weren't invited...

08:27.882 --> 08:31.978
- ...and you attacked the guy I was with.
- Oh, yeah, well...

08:32.136 --> 08:34.434
- ...you used to like it when I did that.
- No.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.270
- Sean O'Brien. Yes?
- You've gotta be kidding me.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.654
Come on. I knocked out Sean O'Brien.

08:40.812 --> 08:44.862
- That was 20 years ago.
- And you loved it.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.286
You wanna go to a wedding with me?

08:48.695 --> 08:51.289
- What?
- It's Mike's wedding.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.793
He's, uh, getting married.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.875
- What do you say?
- How did you know him?

08:59.998 --> 09:02.251
- Who?
- The guy I was with.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.961
He called you Ray.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.633
Oh, yeah, I...

09:06.796 --> 09:08.218
- I don't remember that.
- Yeah?

09:08.381 --> 09:11.851
He said, "Hey, Ray, “
and you punched him out.

09:12.218 --> 09:16.644
I don't know. I guess I've seen him around
and maybe, uh... Um...

09:17.807 --> 09:21.903
A friend of a friend.
Why the 20 questions all of a sudden?

09:24.814 --> 09:27.237
No, thanks.
I don't want to go to the wedding.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.851
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.263
- Did you find him?
- Who?

09:56.429 --> 09:57.851
- Charlie.
- No.

09:59.808 --> 10:00.855
Where are they?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.440
Well, the thing is
they're sleeping right now.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.105
- Can you wake them?
- What?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.865
- Wake them!
- Uh...

10:08.233 --> 10:11.658
Listen, I don't mind if you leave them here
just a little longer, okay?

10:11.820 --> 10:13.663
An hour or so. Or longer if you want...

10:13.822 --> 10:16.200
because the thing is, I don't mind.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.164
- Come on, boys!
- Wait, wait, wait.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.750
Your mom's here, come on.
Let's go. Come on, come on.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.507
Come on, get up. Let's go.
Get your shoes on right now.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.543
Shoes, now, come on.
Come on, buddy.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.555
Let's go. Grab the shoes and let's go.
Get in the car.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.348
Thanks.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.145
Wait!

10:46.312 --> 10:49.111
Missy, wait! Miss...

10:49.274 --> 10:53.199
I want to give them this. It's a book.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.989
Wait, Missy!
Missy, I wanted to give them this.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.829
It's... it's a book!

11:00.869 --> 11:03.497
Charlie? What are you doing?

11:03.913 --> 11:05.165
I'm sorry.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.835
- But thanks for everything, okay?
- Wait, what does that mean?

11:09.544 --> 11:14.425
Stop! What does that mean?
Wait, I put my business up for you!

11:14.591 --> 11:17.344
I did a lot more than that,
you motherfucker!

11:17.677 --> 11:19.145
Stop!

11:22.015 --> 11:25.064
- Where are you going?
- You have something to say, say it.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.856
But I got my kids in the car and I ain't
no motherfucker in front of my kids.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.695
- You used me. You used me!
- Hey, hey.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.859
- I didn't use you.
- Then what do you call it'?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.120
Hey, I'm a pimp. You're a pimp.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.406
- We lived together and enjoyed it.
- That is...

11:37.572 --> 11:42.920
- And now ifs done.
- That is such bullshit.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.796
- Don't jive me.
- Jive you?

11:45.955 --> 11:48.378
Yeah, don't evade. Do not evade.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.794
What, you were just gonna
sneak out of here...

11:50.960 --> 11:52.928
and leave me in the lurch?

11:53.087 --> 11:56.057
I fucked you, Charlie.
I fucked you a lot.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.184
And you liked it.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.479
You loved it!

12:02.263 --> 12:03.640
Sure I did.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.484
I like you.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.772
But look, I gotta lay low
for a while, get out of town.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.697
I will get you your money back...

12:11.856 --> 12:15.201
and I'll get you your ho's
shoebox money too.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.612
You took Ray's money?

12:18.404 --> 12:20.702
You know, we do
the best we can, Tanya.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.117
And then we die.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.837
That is all we can do.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.210
Come on.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.002
You're a good woman.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.178
I'll miss you.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.599
I don't believe you.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.186
Two, nine, six, seven...

12:49.936 --> 12:52.655
Two, nine, six, seven, I-X-K.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.905
When we met,
I was a little ﬂinty, I suppose...

12:56.067 --> 12:59.116
because life hadn't turned
out the way I'd expected.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.249
The person I was supposed to grow old with
wasn't there anymore.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.411
And here you are, this second chance...

13:05.576 --> 13:07.544
this miracle.

13:09.414 --> 13:13.169
I look at you across the breakfast table
and I see you smile...

13:13.334 --> 13:14.961
What are you doing here?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.472
I am the reason they're together.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.348
Okay, we are, but...

13:19.799 --> 13:22.928
- You weren't invited.
- Yeah, exactly. How fair is that?

13:23.094 --> 13:25.472
You love me without question
or hesitation...

13:25.638 --> 13:27.231
You know, this is not good, Tanya.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.360
This... They're very sensitive
about the way they met.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.691
Right, exactly. You know how they met.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.107
- Why am I the scapegoat?
- All right. Shh.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.992
- You shh. I'm trying too.
- I'm trying to listen to the vows.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.869
- Shh. Shh.
- You shh.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.154
Shh.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.326
- I just wanted to hear their vows.
- Please shut up.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.004
Charlie's gone, Ray.
He's not coming back.

13:51.998 --> 13:56.048
I will keep you, hold you, love you...

13:56.210 --> 14:00.090
in sickness and in health,
in good times and in bad...

14:00.965 --> 14:05.391
for richer or poorer,
until we are parted by death.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.477
Congratulations!

14:15.063 --> 14:16.565
That was wonderful.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.325
That was so beautiful.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.077
That was brilliant.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.993
Good luck, you guys.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.162
Oh, God.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.843
Are you gonna be all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.720
And I don't need your help right now.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.970
Okay. All right. It's okay.

14:43.758 --> 14:47.388
It's okay. All right, all right.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.149
<i>If this is you at a wedding,
I'd hate to see you at a divorce.</i>

14:54.060 --> 14:55.687
All right?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.898
All right, you did good.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.535
Look at all these happy people.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.490
You did good.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.954
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.373
Hi.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.633
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.514
I thought you weren't coming?

15:23.673 --> 15:26.017
- I changed my mind.
- I'm glad.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.349
- You look great.
- H I. Hi.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.105
Hi.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.266
Sorry. Did I...?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.527
Jess, this is, uh...

15:36.102 --> 15:37.399
- ...Tanya.
- Oh, come on.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.906
We know each other, Ray,
from the wellness center.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.987
- Yeah, we've met. Hi.
- Yes, of course.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.573
- Can I grab you for a sec?
- Sure.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.454
- Mike, congratulations.
- Oh, Jessica.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.990
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.751
Oh, so good to see you.
You look great.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.536
- She looks great, Ray.
- Doesn't she?

15:53.703 --> 15:55.546
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.629
It was a beautiful ceremony.
I feel so proud.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.219
I'm gonna borrow him
for a couple secs. Ahem.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.676
- I'll bring him right back.
- Congratulations.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.767
What is Tanya doing here?
- I don't know.

16:07.925 --> 16:11.304
Frances isn't a fan, Ray. Not a fan.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.239
Oh, wait. Frances!

16:22.398 --> 16:23.775
Hey!

16:52.011 --> 16:54.139
Jess. Jess.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.649
Oysters.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.309
Come on, you're gonna try one.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.604
- Nope.
- Come on, they're an aphrodisiac.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.647
Ray, Ray, Ray. I have to leave, Ray.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.066
Ray, I have to leave.
They're asking me to leave.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.701
- Who?
- This guy.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.863
Miss. Actually exit this way, lady.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.451
Yes, I know.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.036
I told you I'm going.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.873
- What's the problem?
- Well...

17:16.035 --> 17:18.878
Frances mentioned to me
this lady was not invited.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.757
- Okay, she's with me.
- What do you mean?

17:21.915 --> 17:24.464
- No, it's fine.
- Ray, don't. Don't, come on.

17:24.627 --> 17:29.007
I'm the best man.
And, uh, she's with me.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.052
This lovely lady is my date...

17:33.010 --> 17:37.231
and this lady is my plus one.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.434
I see.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.234
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Here, have an oyster.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.115
They're an aphrodisiac.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.032
Ray! Ray Drecker!

17:50.653 --> 17:52.246
- Coming.
- Ray!

17:52.405 --> 17:54.828
- Hey, there he is.
- Hi. Hello.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.461
Gosh, I just ﬂew in from the oyster bar...

17:59.620 --> 18:01.122
and, boy, my arms are tired.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.596
I guess I'm supposed to tell you
what a great guy Mike is.

18:10.172 --> 18:13.267
- He is.
- He looks handsome tonight.

18:13.426 --> 18:17.181
- How long has it been going on?
- What?

18:17.346 --> 18:21.726
The selling of my ex-husband.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.980
I don't know what you mean.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.490
You're a pimp, Tanya.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.744
I run a wellness center.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.779
You're a pimp...

18:34.530 --> 18:36.624
and Ray works for you.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.704
Well, yeah...

18:41.871 --> 18:44.841
I figured out the pimp part
after a while...

18:46.000 --> 18:50.346
but Ray...
That was certainly a surprise.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.637
- Jessica...
- It's okay. I'm not mad.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.303
A year ago I'm sure he never
would have imagined...

18:57.470 --> 19:00.394
that he'd be sitting here.

19:00.556 --> 19:04.527
He's not my husband anymore. He hasn't
been my husband for a very long time.

19:04.685 --> 19:08.610
And I beta year ago, if I said to Frances:

19:08.773 --> 19:12.698
"You're going to marry
an earth science teacher...

19:13.527 --> 19:15.950
who collects baseball cards..."
Ha, ha, ha.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.956
Didn't know that, did you?

19:18.115 --> 19:20.334
She probably wouldn't
have believed me either.

19:20.493 --> 19:25.044
Mike and Frances don't exactly travel
in the same circles...

19:25.206 --> 19:29.427
but one day they met. Ahem.

19:29.585 --> 19:34.136
In a park. In a public park.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.718
But it doesn't really matter
where or how.

19:36.884 --> 19:41.481
What matters is that they...

19:42.348 --> 19:44.066
That they found each other.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.978
They found happiness.
This one day they met...

19:47.144 --> 19:50.739
and they were put together.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.952
And they're still together today.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.415
To...

20:00.741 --> 20:05.747
saying and doing the right things.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.925
And to listening to what's being said...

20:10.084 --> 20:14.180
even when it's not spoken.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.342
To being brave enough...

20:19.802 --> 20:22.055
to be who you are.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.315
To being honest...

20:27.101 --> 20:28.728
telling the truth.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.483
To Mike and Frances.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.323
Hear, hear.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.035
Congratulations.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.052
That toast...
- Congratulations, buddy.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.350
Ray, stop. Ray, stop walking.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.055
- Not now.
- God, she knows!

21:01.218 --> 21:03.471
- I gotta tell her.
- She knows. She already knows.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.686
She just told me. She's not stupid.
She figured it out.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.227
She knows?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.987
Ray, I'm sorry. All right?

21:12.146 --> 21:14.569
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened
between you...

21:14.815 --> 21:18.194
or how you were or used to be
or why she left you for Ronnie.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.204
For a guy like Ronnie? I don't know.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.536
But she did, Ray. She left.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.667
And you let her.

21:25.826 --> 21:29.376
And maybe you thought
you wanted to give her an orgasm...

21:29.538 --> 21:33.759
or get her back or whatever, but it's
not good, Ray, for either one of you.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.966
You're a good man, Ray.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.298
You're better than you think.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.303
She must fucking hate me.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.932
No, Ray.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.776
Yeah, she probably fucking hates me.

21:50.935 --> 21:54.485
No, she doesn't hate you.
Nobody hates you.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.822
What am I gonna say now?

21:59.318 --> 22:00.945
You don't have to say anything.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.407
Just go to her.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.085
You... it's gonna be okay.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.889
Jess, listen...

23:02.047 --> 23:04.141
He's so good.

23:10.806 --> 23:15.107
- Well, he's in love.
- You didn't sing at our wedding.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.569
I could sing for you now.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.612
I don't know the words.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.924
We had some good years.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.762
Yeah.

23:50.554 --> 23:51.601
Really good.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.062
Yeah.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.523
Are you good at your job?

24:03.192 --> 24:04.660
Yeah.

24:10.074 --> 24:12.702
- I want to dance.
- I wanted to tell you.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.290
Let's...

24:15.079 --> 24:16.126
just dance.

24:16.288 --> 24:20.009
- Jess, I'm sorry.
- Just dance with me.
