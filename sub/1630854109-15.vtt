WEBVTT

00:33.101 --> 00:34.001
Someone, help!

00:34.102 --> 00:35.169
Help is on the way!

00:35.269 --> 00:36.537
How long?
They said ten minutes.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.719
Hold on!

00:58.159 --> 00:59.527
Hey. Hey, look at me.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.862
Okay. Grab the rope.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.031
Okay. Okay.
Grab the rope.
Come on. Grab the rope.

01:04.132 --> 01:06.234
Grab the rope. Look up.
Don't look down.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.869
Good, good, good.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.272
Yeah, come on. Good.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.540
Come on, help 'em up.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.908
That's it. Hurry.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.818
You saved my life. Thank you.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.355
Where'd he go?

01:55.949 --> 01:58.919
Hey, whoever's in there,
come out right now.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.324
Hi.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.193
You're home.
Yeah, I couldn't wait
any longer.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.195
And I-I really want to hug you,

02:07.295 --> 02:09.096
but you're still
holding the...
Oh, right.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.098
Oh, my gosh.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.174
Mm. No, so,

02:20.274 --> 02:22.210
I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm so gross right now.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.245
You're perfect.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.713
Except I'm pretty sure

02:25.813 --> 02:28.282
you drank that OJ
straight from the bottle.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.783
Oh, well, in my defense,

02:29.883 --> 02:31.819
you weren't supposed to be home
until tomorrow.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.454
I moved my travel orders up.

02:33.554 --> 02:37.491
It only took three requests--
two informal, one formal--

02:37.591 --> 02:40.160
uh, eight emails
and one very long phone call.

02:40.261 --> 02:44.698
That is a lot of red tape
to cut through.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.767
Is that turning you on
right now?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.836
Just a little bit.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.974
Do you think everyone else is
gonna be as surprised to see me?

02:54.742 --> 02:55.809
Uh, surprised?

02:55.909 --> 02:58.679
I mean, you came at me
with cookware.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.681
Oh. Well, yeah.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.583
They'll be, they'll be
totally surprised.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.752
Fun. Okay, don't tell anyone
that I'm here.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.487
I want to see all their faces
when I walk in.

03:06.587 --> 03:07.888
Sure.

03:17.598 --> 03:18.866
Alan!

03:18.966 --> 03:20.334
You're back.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.069
A day early. Yeah.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.637
Surprise.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.775
Um...

03:28.942 --> 03:32.946
That means today is actually
my last day up here.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.049
I mean, not last day
with NCIS, though.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.489
Kai, what do you know
about this guy in the video?

03:41.589 --> 03:42.823
Great, uh...
Guys, hi!

03:43.624 --> 03:45.025
Luce.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.193
You're back.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.828
Welcome home.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.663
Oh, that's a baby. Yeah.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.565
Daniel's off-island
for a couple days.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.034
And you're watching Nate?
Actually, Alex is.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.870
He just needed to come by
and grab my house key. Oh.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.140
Looks like I caught you guys
in the middle of a lot.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.142
Desertion case.
Weird one, too.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.044
We were just filling in Tennant
if you want to...

04:04.144 --> 04:07.114
Yeah, let's-- Sure.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.816
Let's-- Yep.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.752
Okay.

04:11.852 --> 04:16.657
So, a video has been circulating
of a heroic cliffside save

04:16.757 --> 04:17.958
that happened yesterday
near Manoa.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.860
And this relates to

04:19.960 --> 04:21.895
a desertion case how?
Well, a tip came in

04:21.995 --> 04:24.698
that our Good Samaritan here
resembled a Navy officer

04:24.798 --> 04:26.767
that abandoned his post
eight years ago.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.669
Facial rec confirmed
his identity.

04:28.769 --> 04:29.803
All right,
what do we know about him?

04:29.903 --> 04:31.605
Lieutenant Adrian Park.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.541
Worked as
a Foreign Area Officer

04:33.641 --> 04:36.444
stationed at
the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.011
Intimately involved in

04:38.111 --> 04:41.449
all things political, economic
and military in Korea.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.417
Dinners with dignitaries

04:43.517 --> 04:45.719
and negotiations
with North Korea.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.521
Wow, he was busy.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.789
Yeah, all up until

04:48.889 --> 04:50.223
the day he just disappeared.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.259
So he walked away
from an important job,

04:52.360 --> 04:54.127
promising career.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.729
Why?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.565
The only thing that jumps out
is he asked for a discharge

04:57.665 --> 04:58.832
but was denied.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.701
Claimed he had
disc issues in his back.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.070
His back seems fine to me. Yeah.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.639
Navy thought so, too.
Soon after, though, he vanished.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.808
Was he under investigations?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.577
Take any sensitive material
when he left?

05:09.677 --> 05:11.345
Squeaky-clean, allegedly.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.046
He left for a reason.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.882
Found them.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.116
Lucy!
Alex! Hey!

05:16.216 --> 05:18.318
It's so good to...
Oh. Shoot.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.654
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's-- Yep.
I'm sorry. I should...

05:20.754 --> 05:23.323
Well, see you later.
Yeah, see you.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.427
All right, guys, let's
go find Lieutenant Park.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.728
Hey, glad you're back.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.762
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.131
Oh, I-I have...

05:32.366 --> 05:33.467
...presents.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.471
Hey, Ernie.
Did you see Lucy?

05:37.571 --> 05:39.339
Uh, she's coming
back tomorrow.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.778
She's back?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.780
Yeah.
Where is she now?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.348
Look, I'm sure
she'll be by soon.

05:48.449 --> 05:52.152
In the meantime,
did you find anything on Park?

05:52.252 --> 05:53.387
Right.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.222
Info on our deserter.
Come and sit.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.357
Okay.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.094
Not a whole lot. Ooh.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.731
Only that this was
a real sofa's choice.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.399
You mean "Sophie's choice"?

06:05.499 --> 06:08.068
I choose my words like I choose
my high-voltage cables:

06:08.168 --> 06:09.437
carefully.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.939
Now, if Lieutenant Park
just stayed on his sofa,

06:12.039 --> 06:14.307
he'd still be anonymous.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.843
Instead he went viral.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.745
Allowing us to now rely
on the wisdom of the crowd

06:17.845 --> 06:19.112
to learn more about him.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.248
Okay, you used the word
"wisdom" in relation to

06:21.348 --> 06:22.450
a comments section.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.118
So much for choosing
your words carefully.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.887
Well, if
you want to argue

06:26.987 --> 06:28.722
social theory
with Aristotle,

06:28.822 --> 06:30.758
you're a couple
thousand years too late.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.526
In the meantime,
take a look at this.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.028
Whoa. That's in Korean.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.700
Thanks.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.636
"That's my language teacher."

06:42.736 --> 06:44.838
The commenter goes to
a language school in Keeaumoku.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.674
Honolulu's Koreatown.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.042
That's a good place
for Park to hide out.
So, the thing is,

06:49.142 --> 06:50.978
is I wasn't able to find
anyone teaching there

06:51.078 --> 06:52.379
under the name Adrian Park,

06:52.480 --> 06:55.215
but I did find
a David Lee.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.120
He's teaching under an alias.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.490
Okay. Any addresses on file?

07:02.590 --> 07:04.091
Uh, nothing. It's--

07:04.191 --> 07:06.359
The place is a small operation,
it deals all in cash.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.895
There's no classes on
the schedule today,

07:07.995 --> 07:09.763
but he seems
to sub often.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.665
I'll-I'll text you if
I find out anything.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.733
Okay, thank you.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.002
Oh, wait. Hmm.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.704
If Lucy's back,
what about the...

07:16.804 --> 07:17.705
I know.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.007
Oh, that's a problem.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.754
What are we doing about
Lucy's surprise party?

07:33.854 --> 07:36.189
No plan survives first contact. Okay.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.726
The Marine quotes of the day
aren't helping.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.160
No, Kai's right.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.361
We improvise.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.763
Look, Whistler offered
to host tonight.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.633
Okay, except Wally's
is not open today.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.234
And I'm not sure
if I can

07:47.334 --> 07:49.002
get all the staff in
on short notice.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.738
And the cake's not
gonna be ready.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.740
What's the plan, boss?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.775
Okay, well, it will
still be a surprise

07:54.875 --> 07:56.076
if we have the party tomorrow.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.978
Okay.
As planned.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.781
So, uh, what do we do
in the meantime?

08:01.982 --> 08:03.283
Am I missing a briefing?

08:03.383 --> 08:05.052
Yeah.
No, we...

08:06.219 --> 08:07.588
It's not exactly a briefing.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.089
They're just filling me in
on what Ernie found.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.457
Yeah.
Okay.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.626
So we do this as a group
in your office now?

08:12.726 --> 08:13.994
No.
Yeah, we...

08:16.997 --> 08:18.398
Did you have something?

08:18.498 --> 08:22.936
Well, David Lee has
near-perfect credit, no tickets,

08:23.036 --> 08:25.873
no warrants and
always pays his taxes on time.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.009
That's it.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.279
Great. Thank you, Lucy.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.182
Oh. It's Ernie.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.651
Park will be subbing
for a class in one hour.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.353
All right, Kai,
you and Jesse go pick him up.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.857
Lucy, try to find what Park's
been up to the past eight years.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.626
And, hey,

08:45.726 --> 08:47.294
we're all glad that you're back.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.800
How are we doing this?

08:52.900 --> 08:56.737
Guns holstered,
badges out.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.238
Guy's a deserter,
you know.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.073
He's not a
dangerous criminal.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.642
Who's living
under an alias.

09:01.742 --> 09:02.943
He also saved a woman's life.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.444
People are complex.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.080
Look, there was this one Marine
when I was at Pendleton.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.116
Bronze Star recipient, right?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.151
With a bad habit of
dealing oxy on the side.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.621
We go to pick him up...
Yeah?

09:13.721 --> 09:16.289
...he shot at us four times.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.259
Okay, you run point
this time, then.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.202
Can I help you?

09:29.302 --> 09:31.805
I'm Agent Holman.
This is Agent Boone. NCIS.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.241
You, uh, mind if

09:34.341 --> 09:35.943
we have a
chat outside?

09:38.511 --> 09:41.081
I'm in the middle
of teaching a class right now.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.516
It's important.
Lieutenant Park.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.388
You got to be kidding me.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.588
I'm sure it's been a while
since you saw these.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.491
Eight years, give
or take, right?
Yeah.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.159
It's a pretty good cover.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.394
Come to Hawai'i,

10:27.494 --> 10:28.962
work at a
language school

10:29.062 --> 10:31.398
that doesn't require background
checks and pays in cash.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.067
Eight years you didn't get
noticed for who you really are.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.535
Until you saw
that woman,

10:35.635 --> 10:39.372
desperate on the
side of the cliff.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.809
Yeah, I mean, you could've
just walked away.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.877
She would have died.
No doubt.

10:43.977 --> 10:47.114
It's honorable that you blew
your cover to rescue her.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.983
It's not so honorable
deserting your post in Korea.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.054
Reconcile that for us.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.555
I did what I had to do.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.491
The rescue
or, uh, the desertion?

11:00.728 --> 11:02.763
You were a FAO, right?

11:02.863 --> 11:06.399
You had TS/SCI
clearance.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.369
And you had extensive...

11:09.469 --> 11:12.539
extensive contact
with North Korea.
Yeah, negotiations.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.142
I was trying to establish peace.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.409
But instead,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.979
you end up living
here under an alias.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.281
Working at a place
with a steady stream

11:21.381 --> 11:22.716
of incoming foreign nationals.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.317
That's an ideal location

11:24.417 --> 11:25.452
to cultivate assets.

11:25.552 --> 11:26.820
I'm not a spy.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.957
Who sped off in the SUV
when we grabbed you?

11:31.224 --> 11:32.960
We have a BOLO out.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.362
It's only a matter of time
before we find it,

11:35.462 --> 11:39.066
so you may as well
do yourself a favor and tell us.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.134
Look, I'm not
what you think I am.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.635
Then tell us what you are.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.171
Because right now
you're a man with few options.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.406
Getting fewer by the second.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.114
I can't.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.586
Hey, Alan. Hey.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.021
Midday snack?

12:01.121 --> 12:02.722
Clearing out my food
from the fridge.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.458
I'm sure you can still keep
your food in the fridge.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.994
I'm sorry.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.029
All I've done is
rain on your parade.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.131
No. It's fine.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.565
Uh, it's not fine.

12:12.665 --> 12:16.636
For a few months,
I touched greatness.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.405
The A-team.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.472
And now it's over.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.408
I'm sure you'll be back soon.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.776
You know my only regret?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.845
I didn't get a chance
to work with you.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.679
Me?

12:26.780 --> 12:29.850
I know about
all your collars now.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.752
And someone said you could fly?

12:32.853 --> 12:35.422
Oh, I think you mean
I'm a flyer.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.925
Like, cheerleading.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.562
That makes so much more sense. Yeah.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.198
Hey, they, um...
they talked about me?

12:45.999 --> 12:48.869
All they've been talking about
this week is you coming back.
Really?

12:48.969 --> 12:52.605
I don't know,
because things feel a bit off.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.741
Hey, did your girlfriend
really sing to you

12:54.842 --> 12:55.809
in front of everyone?

12:55.909 --> 12:56.877
Yeah.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.645
I wish
I could have seen it.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.447
Actually, maybe not.

13:00.547 --> 13:04.651
Uh, I get really emotional when
I witness acts of pure love.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.586
Uh...

13:07.654 --> 13:09.722
Hold on.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.659
This is for you.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.062
Got something for everyone
on the A-team.

13:16.529 --> 13:17.597
Thank you.

13:17.697 --> 13:18.731
Yeah.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.606
Hey.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.715
Hey. Got something for us?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.885
Yeah. Just heard back from MCRT.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.119
They searched the
language school.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.820
Found two phones
that belong to Park,

13:40.921 --> 13:43.423
and one is registered to
his alias David Lee.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.724
Okay, what about the other?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.094
Not registered at all.
Burner phone.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.896
Do we have any record
of who he was calling?

13:48.996 --> 13:50.763
That's the thing. He only
called one number with it--

13:50.864 --> 13:53.800
also not registered,
recently deactivated.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.536
Okay.
Surreptitious communications,

13:56.636 --> 13:58.471
possible connections
to an enemy,

13:58.571 --> 13:59.973
a triple-A fake identity.

14:00.073 --> 14:03.110
Guy's definitely a spy, right?

14:03.210 --> 14:04.344
Hey, Lucy!

14:04.444 --> 14:06.313
Hi, Ernie.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.847
Oh!
How was the ship?

14:07.948 --> 14:08.949
Was it everything
you hoped it would be?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.217
You have to tell me everything.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.851
Oh, man, I would love to,
but, hey...

14:11.952 --> 14:13.286
What?
Work.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.922
Oh, yeah.
Right. Sorry.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.556
What have you got?
Sorry.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.591
I did some digging.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.061
Whether Lieutenant Park
is a spy or not,

14:21.161 --> 14:24.631
he had extensive contact
with one before deserting.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.600
Bomi Seong.
North Korean diplomat.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.670
Could be who he's been
contacting with the burner.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.305
Maybe even who got
away in the SUV.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.873
Okay, do we have any leads
that we can follow?

14:33.974 --> 14:35.242
Well, Park mostly uses

14:35.342 --> 14:37.577
a P.O. box,
but I managed to track down

14:37.677 --> 14:39.279
an address for a townhouse

14:39.379 --> 14:40.413
in Ewa Beach.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.748
All right, Ernie,

14:41.848 --> 14:43.516
find everything you can
on Bomi Seong.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.419
Jesse, Lucy, grab Kai,
head to Park's townhouse.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.955
Let's see what he's hiding.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.862
This feels nice.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.098
Yeah, gang's
all back together.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.101
Oh, I meant walking on
land again, but that, too.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.503
Ah, you getting
your land legs back?

15:03.603 --> 15:05.005
Slowly.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.574
Oh, but you know
what might help?

15:07.674 --> 15:08.875
A night out
with the A-team.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.643
How about
tomorrow night?

15:10.743 --> 15:12.479
Uh, I can't.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.181
Gracie has got
a school thing.

15:14.281 --> 15:18.385
Yeah, I-I, uh, I was planning
to take Inoki to the park.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.420
Oh, that sounds like fun.
I'll go with you.
No, no, no.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.689
It's an exclusive thing
for, like, for dogs.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.392
It's like
a doggy meet and greet.

15:26.726 --> 15:27.927
Day after tomorrow, though,
great, great.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.563
Same.
Yeah. We're here. Great.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.465
Okay.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.834
NCIS!

15:49.482 --> 15:51.051
Power's not on.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.621
I've seen IKEA showrooms
look more lived in than this.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.926
Stock photos?

16:00.693 --> 16:03.763
Didn't even bother
to take off the price tags.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.767
Why rent a whole townhouse
if you don't even use it?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.969
Keep looking.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.409
Guys.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.442
Runner!

17:03.323 --> 17:05.225
Guess no shaking off
the rust for you.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.427
What happened to the other guy?

17:07.527 --> 17:08.561
He got away.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.430
Let's go.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.068
Where'd that come from?!
I don't know.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.176
Everybody okay?
Yeah, I think so.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.348
He's not.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.393
Hey, Commander Chase.
Oh, hi, Kai.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.529
We learn anything
about our body here?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.497
In clinical terms,
he died from

17:44.597 --> 17:47.234
a vulnus sclopetarium.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.568
In layman's terms...

17:48.668 --> 17:51.571
He was shot to death.
I was there.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.972
A through and through

17:53.072 --> 17:56.609
caused by a full metal jacket
nine millimeter.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.145
Any chance you
could I.D. him?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.046
Prints,
blood work, dental.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.081
None of it is registered
in any U.S. database.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.550
"U.S."

18:03.650 --> 18:06.486
I'm guessing that means
you know he's foreign.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.054
Knowing would imply
I could prove it,

18:08.155 --> 18:10.457
but I have a strong suspicion
this man is North Korean.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.858
How can you tell?

18:11.958 --> 18:15.094
Signs of osteomalacia.
Disease that weakens bones.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.429
Common for someone
who's had

18:16.529 --> 18:18.931
a lifetime of
micronutrient deficiency.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.733
Right, as if he grew up
in a place

18:20.833 --> 18:22.502
that experienced
multiple famines.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.438
Our John Doe's labs
showed lower than normal

18:25.538 --> 18:28.375
levels of vitamin D,
iron, iodine and zinc.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.010
Consistent with
other North Korean subjects.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.545
I know.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.114
It's terribly sad what the
people there have had to endure.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.883
That.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.085
But it also confirms
we have North Koreans

18:39.186 --> 18:41.120
operating on U.S. soil.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.524
Notified INDOPACOM.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.926
North Korea's denying
all activity.

18:47.026 --> 18:49.662
Did you tell 'em that Jesse
got punched like nine times

18:49.762 --> 18:51.063
by a North Korean operative?

18:51.164 --> 18:52.999
How do you know that?
You were in the bedroom.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.234
Kai told me.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.669
Not to mention,
they shot one of their own.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.671
INDOPACOM is managing
things at a strategic level

18:58.771 --> 19:00.440
while we track down
these operatives.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.908
Any sign of Bomi Seong?

19:02.008 --> 19:04.143
Well, we only had visuals
on the one who got away

19:04.244 --> 19:05.878
and the one who got a
beating and a bullet.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.647
Did you get a sense
of why they were there?

19:07.747 --> 19:09.316
Looking for something.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.351
But besides the showroom floor
furniture set,

19:11.451 --> 19:12.752
the place had nothing.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.754
Maybe they weren't there
to retrieve something

19:14.854 --> 19:16.623
but rather someone.

19:16.723 --> 19:17.957
Like a rendezvous point.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.492
What else do
we know about

19:19.592 --> 19:21.060
what North Korean
black ops are up to?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.363
Maybe we can anticipate
their next move.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.397
I'll admit it.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.333
I know almost nothing about 'em.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.901
Yeah, I'm not too up-to-date
on their latest operations.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.805
But we know someone who is.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.444
<i>I know, I know. (shushes)</i>

19:37.544 --> 19:38.811
I know.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.348
Everything okay?

19:41.448 --> 19:44.384
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.885
He's not.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.287
Well, did you try the five S's?

19:47.387 --> 19:49.589
Swaddle, side-stomach,
shush, swing, suck?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.724
I've done like a hundred S's.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.426
I know. I know.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.095
Okay. Okay.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.072
Apparently, "SAC" is
the only "S" that works.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.208
You'll get better.

20:10.677 --> 20:11.644
I'll get it.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.314
Cool. I'm gonna go pass out.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.017
Who is it?

20:20.119 --> 20:21.688
How long have I been gone?

20:21.788 --> 20:22.922
He's not mine.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.725
Aren't you
the cutest little guy?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.694
You should've taken credit
for him.
All right.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.162
What are you doing here?

20:30.997 --> 20:32.098
You had some questions.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.667
I did, but most people
would just call.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.002
And miss a chance
to visit

20:36.102 --> 20:37.670
my favorite
Special Agent in Charge?

20:37.770 --> 20:40.172
Pantry's
around the corner.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.409
Yeah, not much
of an appetite, thanks.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.210
Should I be worried about you?

20:44.311 --> 20:47.013
Nah. Stomach just
doesn't always sit right

20:47.113 --> 20:49.349
whenever I'm dealing
with North Korean kill squads.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.086
You want to clarify?
Well, a few years ago,

20:54.186 --> 20:56.423
some guys were going after
a North Korean dignitary

20:56.523 --> 20:57.757
who spoke ill
of the regime,

20:57.857 --> 21:00.026
and I got
this really bad stomach bug.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.861
No, you said "kill squads"?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.563
One of the guys
you had in custody

21:03.663 --> 21:05.998
immediately caught a bullet,
didn't he?

21:06.833 --> 21:09.268
You're dealing with
some rude dudes.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.037
Now, can I get
a closer look

21:11.137 --> 21:13.573
at this adorable-looking
little baby?

21:13.673 --> 21:15.608
What's up?

21:17.176 --> 21:18.678
How was the first day back?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.212
It was fine.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.081
I heard you kicked
a North Korean operative's ass.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.683
You heard about that?
Yeah.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.884
Kai texted me with a GIF

21:24.984 --> 21:26.453
of Mighty Mouse
beating up a bad guy.

21:26.553 --> 21:27.654
It was cute.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.188
I don't get it.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.058
Well, I think because
you are small but powerful.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.260
No, I get
the Mighty Mouse thing.

21:34.361 --> 21:37.263
But I... yeah, I get back
and everybody's weird,

21:37.364 --> 21:39.899
and you're getting
live text updates of the day.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.936
Well, I, you know,
I wouldn't read so much into it.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.806
You should've seen 'em.
They were acting strange.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.240
They're probably busy.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.876
So busy they can't even
make plans with me?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.344
Look, I'm sure
there are extenuating...

21:51.444 --> 21:53.012
I couldn't wait to come
back and see everyone.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.814
It's like, you know,
I don't, I don't need

21:54.914 --> 21:57.049
a big welcome home, but,
I guess, just something.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.285
Well, we're throwing you
a surprise party.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.625
Um...

22:05.725 --> 22:07.894
It was planned for tomorrow, but
then you came home a day early,

22:07.994 --> 22:09.562
and we've been trying to pivot

22:09.662 --> 22:11.263
and make it work
without you finding out.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.699
Oh.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.367
Well, it's still,
it's still happening.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.469
It just...
well, it has to be tomorrow

22:16.569 --> 22:18.605
because that's when we could
get everything together.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.508
Oh, my gosh,
you guys are the best!

22:26.178 --> 22:27.614
Oh, and you.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.716
You used to
protect secrets

22:29.816 --> 22:32.652
for a living,
and you let one slip

22:32.752 --> 22:35.488
'cause you couldn't stand
to see me upset.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.558
Well, I guess
I kind of did.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.693
Mm-hmm.

22:40.793 --> 22:45.164
Mm, but promise me
you will still act surprised.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.301
They will not
suspect a thing.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.744
Charlie 1.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.378
<i>Buenos días, muchacho.</i>

22:59.479 --> 23:02.482
This is who Tennant called about
the North Korean black ops.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.816
Bingo.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.217
Hey, you know we got
bowls for that, right?

23:05.985 --> 23:07.487
North Koreans sent a kill squad.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.957
But Park's in our custody.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.492
Why go after him at all?

23:12.592 --> 23:13.726
Maybe they're also looking
for someone else.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.194
Bomi Seong.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.597
Why would they want
Park and Bomi dead

23:17.697 --> 23:18.931
if they're North Korean assets?

23:19.031 --> 23:21.000
Because they're not.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.436
Park left eight years ago.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.638
Not a peep on the streets
from Bomi Seong since.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.106
Nothing at all?

23:27.206 --> 23:28.441
Poof.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.209
Popped smoke.
Well, it makes sense

23:30.309 --> 23:32.344
the North Korean kill squad
would be after her if she fled.

23:32.445 --> 23:33.680
Question is:

23:33.780 --> 23:37.183
Why would Park and Bomi flee
at the same time?

23:37.283 --> 23:39.519
But I think we all know
the answer to that.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.255
And only one person can confirm.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.192
Bomi Seong, North Korean spy.

23:51.230 --> 23:56.969
She is what we colloquially call
a "honeypot."

23:58.037 --> 24:00.773
She's supposed
to get close to you.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.510
Get you to turn.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.812
But the plan
didn't work.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.848
Because you guys fell in love.

24:10.282 --> 24:14.086
But, of course, you
couldn't be with her

24:14.186 --> 24:16.623
given your position
in the Navy,

24:16.723 --> 24:19.391
so you tried to get out.

24:19.492 --> 24:23.095
And there was no way North Korea
was just gonna let her go.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.099
So you had to
go into hiding.

24:29.936 --> 24:32.038
Is she okay?

24:32.138 --> 24:33.706
As far as we know.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.542
Do you know where she is?

24:36.342 --> 24:39.078
I was hoping
you'd help with that.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.782
Let's start with
an easy question.

24:42.882 --> 24:46.519
Was Bomi the one driving the SUV
at the language school?

24:47.520 --> 24:48.755
And I take it,

24:48.855 --> 24:51.924
at that point,
you both realized you were made.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.292
Where's Bomi now?

24:53.392 --> 24:54.827
I don't know.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.963
Given who she used to be,
I know you have a bug-out plan.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.330
And what happens if I tell you?

24:58.430 --> 25:00.499
We find and protect her.
And then what?

25:00.600 --> 25:03.135
She's a known spy
illegally in this country.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.337
You and I both know what happens
if you bring her in.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.640
She'll have to answer for
the crimes she committed.

25:07.740 --> 25:08.941
She'll go to prison. Maybe.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.376
But she'll be alive.

25:10.476 --> 25:13.079
You'll take a mother
away from her children.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.150
How many?
Two.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.519
Seven and five years old.

25:20.620 --> 25:24.456
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.860
There is
a North Korean kill squad

25:27.960 --> 25:29.929
on the island.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.931
If you want to
protect your family,

25:32.031 --> 25:33.700
you need to help me.

25:35.568 --> 25:36.869
Right now.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.739
We had a plan.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.841
She would gather up the kids,

25:41.941 --> 25:44.010
head to an airfield
and find a plane.

25:46.646 --> 25:49.281
The BOLO just came through
on Bomi's SUV.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.917
Did they make it
to the airfield?

26:01.427 --> 26:03.429
Careful.
Something feels off.

26:03.529 --> 26:06.132
Yeah, car's
really beat-up.

26:12.705 --> 26:13.940
Go ahead.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.709
Whoa.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.377
Hi.

26:18.477 --> 26:21.380
It's okay. It's all right.
Where's-where's your mom?

26:35.494 --> 26:37.764
Oh, I missed you.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.299
I love you so much.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.769
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

26:42.869 --> 26:44.737
Who doesn't love
a twofer on hugs?

26:44.837 --> 26:46.472
It's relief.

26:46.572 --> 26:49.575
And for his sake, I hope he
lives in it as long as he can.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.577
He know the hornet's nest
he knocked over?

26:51.678 --> 26:53.112
He and Bomi planned
for this day.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.014
Don't think they ever
expected it, though.

26:55.114 --> 26:59.251
North Koreans have a long memory
and a penchant for retribution.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.453
It's peculiar why
they didn't also take the kids.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.090
It's not peculiar
if you're a mother.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.095
SUV traded paint
with someone else

27:09.195 --> 27:13.666
but still ended up in a public
lot with eyeballs and CCTV.

27:15.401 --> 27:16.869
Bomi knew she couldn't get away,

27:16.969 --> 27:18.871
so she gave herself up
to save them.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.873
These people, they
don't just kill.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.641
They make an example of you.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.076
She'd know that
better than anyone.

27:24.176 --> 27:28.147
And yet... she
still did it.

27:29.448 --> 27:32.651
Never thought I'd see the day
I respect a North Korean spy.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.253
You know, she still may be
on-island.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.822
Not for long.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.824
What's chatter in
your world saying?

27:39.091 --> 27:41.460
They're not looking, are they?

27:41.560 --> 27:43.730
Hey, bad guys
are eating their own.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.297
Your words or theirs?

27:45.397 --> 27:46.699
You know how the game works.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.200
It's not a game to them.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.203
The family's lucky
they came out this intact.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.539
They are still not whole.
I feel an ask coming.

27:53.639 --> 27:57.276
Look, someone on our side
is watching.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.078
Someone with every resource
at their fingertips.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.579
If they knew
where the operatives were,

28:00.679 --> 28:01.714
I would tell you.

28:01.814 --> 28:05.284
I'm not asking for answers.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.319
I'm asking for a hand.

28:14.260 --> 28:18.630
Bomi traded being a spy for
being a mother a long time ago.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.305
Charlie 1 came through.

28:26.405 --> 28:29.776
It's like a portal to an all-new
world opened up. Watch this.

28:30.576 --> 28:31.744
Is that...?

28:31.844 --> 28:33.412
Tennant's car.
It's wild, right?

28:33.512 --> 28:34.881
Several surveillance drones

28:34.981 --> 28:36.983
are circling the island
as we speak,

28:37.083 --> 28:39.418
and we get to send in
requests for intel.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.053
You are drunk with power.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.890
Well, it hasn't done
that much good, though.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.457
I mean, I have footage

28:45.557 --> 28:46.793
of Bomi being grabbed.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.560
Even used the
fancy new drones

28:48.660 --> 28:50.362
to find their
vehicle abandoned.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.597
Then they vanished.

28:51.697 --> 28:52.865
It's as if living in
a surveillance state

28:52.965 --> 28:54.200
has prepared them
for this.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.468
Airports are on alert?
Completely.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.538
Keeping an eye on everything,
including North Korean vessels

28:59.638 --> 29:02.141
they could try
to link up with at sea.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.877
And there aren't any
in proximity to the islands?

29:04.977 --> 29:07.947
Mm, not that
we've found.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.283
The little hamster wheel
in there is spinning.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.622
Did I ever tell you I got in
the water during my deployment?

29:16.722 --> 29:17.990
You conquered your fear.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.492
Ooh, "conquer" is
a bit aggrandizing.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.760
I just-- I-I swam.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.830
I'm proud of you, Luce.

29:23.930 --> 29:27.066
Thanks, but, uh,
praise isn't the point.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.400
We were at port,

29:28.500 --> 29:30.036
and I went to this beach
with some new friends,

29:30.136 --> 29:31.770
and they encouraged me
to snorkel.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.440
Wow, and expose yourself
to everything under there?

29:34.540 --> 29:35.908
That's the thing.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.743
I was expecting to see
a literal nightmare,

29:37.844 --> 29:40.880
except it was just
rocks and coral.

29:40.980 --> 29:44.283
Well, because the fish
camouflage themselves.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.684
Exactly.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.619
And then an octopus
popped out of nowhere.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.688
And you lived to tell the tale.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.757
Okay, yes, the
octopus was cute

29:51.858 --> 29:53.092
with its eight
weird little legs.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.828
Point is, it was right
there in front of me

29:55.928 --> 29:58.330
the whole time,
hiding in plain sight.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.870
Maybe the North Koreans
are out there.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.038
We just haven't been
looking hard enough.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.340
Okay.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.343
Here is a row of
fishing vessels.

30:11.443 --> 30:14.113
Good place to hide
in plain sight.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.381
Time to find out

30:15.481 --> 30:18.217
if one of them's fishy.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.055
You get a pass because
I'm proud of you.

30:24.623 --> 30:27.093
Any leads from the vehicle
the operatives abandoned?

30:27.193 --> 30:28.627
No prints. No receipts.

30:28.727 --> 30:31.297
Nothing we could use to
help us know who they are,

30:31.397 --> 30:33.832
where they're staying
or where they're going.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.234
Damn, I need those guys
to come clean my car

30:35.334 --> 30:36.668
after a camping trip
with the family.

30:36.768 --> 30:37.870
Yeah, but there's
also no sign

30:37.970 --> 30:39.505
that they've left
the island yet.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.473
Which means
we still have time.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.475
Eh, but maybe
not much of it.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.111
You have something?
Yeah.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.980
Only an 800-pound bluefin tuna.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.883
As you already know, there's
no sign of the North Koreans

30:50.983 --> 30:52.351
anywhere on Oahu,

30:52.451 --> 30:55.221
but 12 miles off the coast
is international waters.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.623
Lot of people fish there
to avoid U.S. quotas.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.191
Yep. Exactly.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.962
So most of these boats
are tracking schools of fish.

31:03.062 --> 31:07.266
But there's one
just hanging out out there.

31:07.366 --> 31:10.069
This boat isn't tracking
a school of fish.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.271
Doesn't have nets
or cages out.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.040
What's it doing
out there, then?

31:14.140 --> 31:16.242
By all accounts, nothing.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.576
Looks legit.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.446
Boats from Hawai'i start
with the letters H-A.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.847
Except...

31:21.948 --> 31:24.816
HA-1607-AB is
at the bottom of the ocean.

31:24.917 --> 31:27.019
It sunk four years ago.

31:27.119 --> 31:30.656
And judging by the manifest,
this one has an all-Korean crew.

31:30.756 --> 31:31.991
Could be a rendezvous ship.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.425
Which means
Bomi and the operatives

31:33.525 --> 31:34.760
still have to get to it somehow.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.328
Pull up Kewalo Basin Harbor.

31:38.697 --> 31:40.332
Why Kewalo?

31:40.432 --> 31:43.435
Because this harbor is a direct
line to the boat in question.

31:43.535 --> 31:46.038
Let's go get Bomi back.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.282
Any eyes on Bomi
or the North Koreans?

31:56.382 --> 31:57.583
No sign yet.

31:57.683 --> 31:58.784
Maybe they already
booked it out of here.

31:58.884 --> 31:59.851
No way.

31:59.952 --> 32:01.720
Orville would've spotted them.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.622
What happened to Wilbur?

32:03.722 --> 32:04.957
This is Wilbur's brother.

32:05.057 --> 32:06.592
Instead of
an underwater scanner,

32:06.692 --> 32:09.195
Orville is outfitted with a
high-powered surveillance camera

32:09.295 --> 32:12.431
that can read the serial number
off a five-dollar bill

32:12.531 --> 32:13.799
from 1,500 feet.

32:13.899 --> 32:14.933
Ernie, where are you?

32:15.034 --> 32:16.368
I'm on a boat.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.237
Whose boat?

32:18.337 --> 32:19.871
Thought you would never ask.

32:19.972 --> 32:21.707
Can't legally carry a gun
in the States,

32:21.807 --> 32:24.076
but I make
a hell of a chauffeur.

32:24.176 --> 32:27.046
He ate all our snacks.
It's the least he can do.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.681
All right, heads on swivel
and keep moving.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.083
Any idea
what we're looking for?

32:31.183 --> 32:32.418
Something fast and
that could outrun

32:32.518 --> 32:34.186
a Coast Guard
cutter if need be.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.788
Team, I think I got something.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.058
Yep. Found them.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.792
Bomi's tied up on a Zodiac

32:40.892 --> 32:42.094
on slip 104.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.462
All right, Jesse, Lucy,
that's you.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.097
We're on our way over.

32:49.635 --> 32:50.736
Hands! Hey!

32:50.836 --> 32:53.039
Federal agents!
Don't move!

32:54.006 --> 32:55.574
Gun in your belt, drop it!

33:10.922 --> 33:12.624
Boss, I don't
think these guys

33:12.724 --> 33:14.193
plan on reading us
our Miranda rights.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.728
Almost there.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.464
They're gonna get away
if we don't do something.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.166
Or they're gonna shoot us.

33:20.266 --> 33:21.767
Either would
be a bummer.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.935
Get ready.
Orville's got your six.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.613
You good?
I'm good, I'm good!

33:35.747 --> 33:38.584
Can't let them get away.
Not this time.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.123
Bomi! Jump!

33:48.294 --> 33:49.228
I got her, I got her!

33:52.498 --> 33:53.799
I got you.

33:59.571 --> 34:00.806
Kai!

34:05.244 --> 34:07.179
Need a lift?

34:56.928 --> 34:58.230
Thanks for the assist, boss.

34:58.330 --> 35:01.733
Someone aced their
marksmanship qualifications.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.240
Hey.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.908
Your family's safe.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.911
This is all my fault.

35:14.546 --> 35:18.617
You know, I heard this saying
once during on an op in Seoul.

35:24.089 --> 35:26.858
"If your tail's long, someone
will catch it eventually."

35:26.958 --> 35:29.828
There was only so long
that you could live in hiding.

35:29.928 --> 35:30.829
It's over.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.798
But so is everything.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.600
No, maybe it doesn't have to be.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.502
I was a spy.

35:36.602 --> 35:39.771
Which leaves you
with something to offer.

35:41.106 --> 35:43.475
Look, it's a game
to some people.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.010
So play it.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.217
Cake's already there.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.918
All right, I'm gonna
pick up the food.

35:53.018 --> 35:54.686
Need a hand?
As many as I can get.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.021
All right,
maybe Alan can help.

35:56.121 --> 35:57.723
I haven't seen him...
I'm here.

35:57.823 --> 35:58.724
Geez.
What do you need?

35:58.824 --> 35:59.825
Okay, last-minute prep.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.460
Mm-hmm. Anything. Just name it.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.295
All right, what
we're gonna do...
Guys, guys, guys.

36:05.431 --> 36:08.234
Hell of a first case back.
Am I right?
Yeah.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.736
Totally.
Crazy.

36:13.004 --> 36:17.243
Okay. Well, I will
see you guys later.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.913
"Crazy"?
I was just...

36:22.013 --> 36:24.316
Come on, come on.

36:28.053 --> 36:30.722
How long you been
waiting there for me?

36:32.524 --> 36:34.360
Musubi duration.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.527
You ready to talk Park?

36:35.627 --> 36:38.196
D.O.D. sent you to tell me?

36:38.297 --> 36:40.065
Penance for my participation
at the marina.

36:40.165 --> 36:41.500
In case I shoot the messenger.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.601
Something like that.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.636
All right,
how bad is it?

36:45.404 --> 36:46.805
Well...

36:46.905 --> 36:48.674
there are consequences
for spying and desertion.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.141
Their words, not mine.

36:50.242 --> 36:52.043
All right, well, Park and Bomi
didn't have much choice

36:52.143 --> 36:53.412
considering
their situation.

36:53.512 --> 36:54.846
You didn't
let me finish.

36:54.946 --> 36:57.082
They decided to
make an exception.

36:57.182 --> 36:58.750
Huh.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.253
Turns out Bomi knew
all the magic words.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.621
Offered to name names.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.790
Point us to operations
that may still be ongoing.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.992
Not surprising she knows
what information is valuable.

37:07.092 --> 37:10.028
Even suggested that Keith
Braddock from the CIA

37:10.128 --> 37:13.532
would be really interested
in what she has to say.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.033
Keith Braddock, huh?

37:16.368 --> 37:17.903
Turns out he is.

37:18.003 --> 37:20.105
He said give Bomi whatever
she wants in exchange for it.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.807
All right, well,
did that include a pardon

37:21.907 --> 37:25.277
for her husband's desertion
and amnesty for herself?

37:26.812 --> 37:29.080
I think you
know it did.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.584
You're something else,
Jane Tennant.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.786
My words.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.888
And theirs, actually.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.329
<i>I finally got Nate down.</i>

37:43.429 --> 37:45.797
It's so much work.

37:45.897 --> 37:49.067
Changing them,
feeding them, rocking them.

37:49.167 --> 37:50.802
Worrying about
every little thing.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.471
I haven't looked
at my phone once.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.973
Oh, well, in that case, you
should watch Nate more often.

37:57.476 --> 37:58.744
I'm starting
to wonder why

37:58.844 --> 38:00.312
anybody puts themselves
through this.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.648
Hmm.

38:02.748 --> 38:05.484
One day,

38:05.584 --> 38:08.153
if you decide
to have kids...

38:09.321 --> 38:11.857
...you'll realize

38:11.957 --> 38:14.192
it stops being about you.

38:15.861 --> 38:18.229
You'd walk into fire
if you had to.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.798
You're welcome.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.267
Welcome for what?

38:22.368 --> 38:25.136
For never making you
walk into fire.

38:25.236 --> 38:27.873
How quickly you forget
about dinner with Cassandra.

38:29.341 --> 38:30.275
Oh.

38:30.376 --> 38:32.878
Please. I'm too tired to laugh.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.646
I'm gonna go out
for a bit, okay?

38:34.746 --> 38:36.147
Be home by 11:00.

38:36.247 --> 38:37.549
Love you.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.085
I think I love this pillow more.

38:49.194 --> 38:50.529
Surprise!

38:50.629 --> 38:51.897
Oh, my gosh!

38:51.997 --> 38:54.833
This is so amazing, y'all!
I'm so surprised!

38:57.969 --> 39:00.105
Whistler.
I thought discretion
was your thing.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.474
I-- It just came out.
No, it's not,
it's not her fault.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.342
She just loves me so much.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.978
But seriously, thank you. Thanks.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.648
Well, hey, I'm sorry that
we couldn't surprise you

39:09.748 --> 39:12.551
on the day you arrived, but...

39:12.651 --> 39:15.887
you have to know that there
isn't a day that has gone by

39:15.987 --> 39:17.155
that we haven't
thought about you.

39:17.255 --> 39:18.223
To Lucy.

39:18.323 --> 39:20.158

I love it.

39:56.862 --> 39:59.030
It's a boring stapler.

It means you're home.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.005
Picture!

40:11.943 --> 40:13.679
Okay.
All right, who's taking it?

40:13.779 --> 40:15.280
Thank you.
