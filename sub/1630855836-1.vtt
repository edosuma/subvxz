00:05.906 --> 00:08.106
(bodie): Winnipeg centre,
this is skymed 911 medevac

00:08.142 --> 00:09.841
Requesting priority.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.609
- I didn't know it was this bad.
- Wheezer's lucky

00:11.645 --> 00:13.779
He only broke his back.
- Wheezer?

00:13.781 --> 00:15.914
- That's chief pilot wheezer
sir, to you.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.215
- I love you, milosz.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.517
-<i> Kocham cie</i> too, tristan.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.352
Hey, nurse tristan.
I didn't get to see you

00:20.421 --> 00:21.453
After everything that happened.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.388
You were so cool
under pressure.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.591
It was, uh, pretty hot,
actually.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.392
<i> (lexi): When any of us</i>
<i> puts on our gold bars,</i>

00:27.461 --> 00:29.428
<i> It doesn't just mean</i>
<i> we know how to fly a plane,</i>

00:29.563 --> 00:33.098
<i>It means we will put the safety</i>
<i>of everyone in the plane first.</i>

00:33.233 --> 00:35.667
- This is the north.
We make do with what we have

00:35.669 --> 00:37.069
Or people die.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.470
When I told you I got
into med school,

00:38.506 --> 00:40.339
I was kind of hoping
you'd tell me not to go.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.207
(jeremy): I can't be the reason
you don't go after this.

00:42.342 --> 00:44.075
- I love you.
- Yeah, I know, flip.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.645
I'm gonna go on the lam
for a while. I think I need it.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.280
- Damn it, chopper,
go fast but easy!

00:48.282 --> 00:50.049
- This shit ain't paid, crys!

00:50.184 --> 00:51.883
My ex didn't want me
to be a pilot.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.952
- Do you know what you do what?
- Same thing I've wanted

00:54.088 --> 00:55.954
Since I was ten,
to be an astronaut.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.489
I'd be thrilled to attend
selection camp

00:57.525 --> 00:59.758
With space program canada.
- You came back!

00:59.893 --> 01:01.260
- Sorry?
- You're jolene's son.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.194
- My dad was jamaican.
My mom was deep lake.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.863
That's all I know
about my birth parents.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.832
(madison): I believe that you
want this baby.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.834
I don't believe
that you want me.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.702
- You're hayley roberts, right?
The new nurse?

01:10.838 --> 01:13.172
<i> (hayley): When I first came</i>
<i> up here, I was running.</i>

01:13.174 --> 01:16.041
<i> I was trying to pretend</i>
<i> like everything was okay.</i>

01:16.176 --> 01:18.443
<i> But it's not.</i>
<i> My mom died of cancer.</i>

01:18.446 --> 01:20.678
<i> I have the brca-1 gene.</i>

01:20.714 --> 01:23.449
<i> They found precancerous</i>
<i> shadows on my mri.</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:25.117
<i> My oncologist suggested</i>

01:25.186 --> 01:26.851
<i> A preventative</i>
<i> double mastectomy.</i>

01:26.887 --> 01:28.620
You'll be here when I wake up?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.188
- We take care of our own.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.525
(machines beeping)

01:35.563 --> 01:38.096
(bodie): Winnipeg centre,
skymed 911 requesting

01:38.132 --> 01:39.398
Deviations for weather.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.800
(machine beeping)
- I can't.

01:41.935 --> 01:42.935
- Just do it!

01:43.070 --> 01:44.802
- You know how dangerous
this is?

01:44.839 --> 01:47.138
Even in a hospital,
with proper equipment--

01:47.174 --> 01:48.740
- This is family, crys!

01:48.809 --> 01:50.676
(beeping continues)

01:55.349 --> 01:58.016
(upbeat music)

02:00.354 --> 02:02.153
(lexi): You know I love me
a new plane. The question is,

02:02.189 --> 02:04.556
Is this gonna mean
more hours, or layoffs?

02:04.558 --> 02:07.025
(nowak): It's never a good thing
when small airlines over-expand.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.494
And if they go belly up,
we're all out of a job.

02:09.563 --> 02:12.097
- Your polish is showing,
nowak. Doesn't skymed expanding

02:12.232 --> 02:13.765
Mean it's doing well?

02:13.901 --> 02:15.833
- Not for long.
Not in aviation.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.369
Just focus on the job, lexi.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.837
Keep your head down,
and your nose up.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.905
- You know, people always say
that pilots are all cool

02:20.941 --> 02:23.708
And cocky, but all the ones
I know are skinny and anxious.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.343
- Aren't you worried, tristan?

02:25.412 --> 02:27.446
Ontario medevacs fly
with paramedics.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.947
Won't that mean less calls
for you, too?

02:29.082 --> 02:31.783
- Eh, manitoba, ontario.
People always get sick.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.185
And they're always coming up
with new ways

02:33.320 --> 02:35.654
To hurt themselves.
Especially around here.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.789
(plane roaring)

02:37.925 --> 02:39.658
(upbeat music)

02:49.303 --> 02:50.735
(shivering)

02:50.771 --> 02:52.204
- You fix it yet?

02:52.273 --> 02:53.672
- Guy was practically
givin' her away.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.007
Hundred bucks,
can you believe this?

02:55.142 --> 02:56.742
- Yeah, that thing's scrap,
dude.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.444
- Hey, 50 bucks of parts,
she's better than new.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.281
(distant engine revving)

03:04.685 --> 03:06.184
- Shouldn't we move
off the trail?

03:06.187 --> 03:07.285
- Just a couple more minutes.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.958
(chuckling)
hey, heated vest.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.826
Neighbor said it was busted,

03:14.895 --> 03:16.695
But a couple of tweaks,
it's better than new.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.534
(engine revving)

03:23.303 --> 03:24.836
- That's close brett.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.771
- Just a couple more minutes.

03:26.807 --> 03:30.341
(engine revving)

03:30.377 --> 03:31.977
(shouting)

03:35.983 --> 03:38.316
- Okay, brett,
let's have a look.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.784
(grunting)

03:39.820 --> 03:41.753
- He's always doing this,
finding random junk.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.255
(groaning)
- chest hurts.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.190
- Yeah bud, you got hit
by a snowmobile.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.992
- Uh, why don't you come
over here and help me

03:47.127 --> 03:48.860
With some of this gear,
huh, mal?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.529
- I'm gonna listen
to your chest, okay, brett?

03:50.531 --> 03:51.730
Check for internal injuries.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.498
(zapping)
ahh!

03:54.802 --> 03:56.801
(zapping)
ahh! Ahh!

03:56.870 --> 03:58.303
(zapping)

03:58.438 --> 04:00.205
(shouting)

04:01.341 --> 04:02.941
(zapping)

04:03.010 --> 04:04.409
- Whoa.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.045
(panting)

04:07.047 --> 04:09.514
You okay, trist?
- Uh, I'm okay.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.087
(zapping)

04:20.160 --> 04:24.096
- Dude. You souped up a heated
vest with two 12-volts?

04:24.231 --> 04:27.966
- Worked... Better than new...

04:28.101 --> 04:29.835
- See?

04:29.837 --> 04:31.370
My job is bulletproof.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.807
(upbeat music)

04:56.196 --> 04:58.663
(crystal): Double mastectomy,
reconstruction...

04:58.699 --> 05:00.532
There's a lot
of trauma to the body.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.100
- I know.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.269
Six months of physio, crys,
and I still don't have

05:04.404 --> 05:05.670
All my strength back.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.405
- How's the pain?

05:07.441 --> 05:09.141
- Not enough to keep me
out of a plane.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.044
- It's a physical job, hayley.

05:12.179 --> 05:14.078
You can't help anyone
if you do too much too soon

05:14.114 --> 05:15.947
And hurt yourself.
- Okay.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.749
Coming from the person
who thinks she's gonna do

05:17.884 --> 05:20.752
Her clinical full time
and work as a flight nurse?

05:20.887 --> 05:23.955
- Just try and take it easy,
alright?

05:24.091 --> 05:26.991
And don't be afraid to take
your pain meds if you need them.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.966
It can't all be kidney function
and cranial nerves.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.568
It's mostly cranial nerves,

05:37.604 --> 05:39.571
But sometimes I just need
ten minutes

05:39.640 --> 05:41.640
With words that aren't latin.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.843
- It's sweet,
how much you miss him.

05:46.446 --> 05:47.579
It's been six months.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.514
You still haven't
heard anything?

05:50.617 --> 05:53.251
- Jer's in the bush,
he can't exactly call.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.721
He needed some time
to clear his head,

05:55.856 --> 05:58.356
And that takes
as long as it takes.

05:58.425 --> 06:01.259
You know, I only ever
wear flight suits or scrubs.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.728
Does this say "med student"
or "court date"?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.730
- The white coat sells it.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.900
- I just, I really want
to get this right, you know?

06:08.936 --> 06:10.335
I'm the first person
from north house

06:10.470 --> 06:12.671
To go to medical school.
- Hey.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.006
You're gonna crush it,
dr. Highway.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.208
(soft music)

06:18.746 --> 06:21.079
- Oh, I gotta go.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.882
I'm glad to have you back.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.553
Don't hurt your patients,
and don't hurt yourself.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.288
- Yes, ma'am.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.892
(door opens)

06:33.961 --> 06:36.361
(sighs)

06:36.363 --> 06:38.363
(door closes)

06:40.401 --> 06:42.634
(soft music)

06:56.316 --> 06:59.050
(upbeat music)

07:09.562 --> 07:11.195
(tristan): Welcome back, baby!

07:11.231 --> 07:12.464
Not to throw you
into the deep end,

07:12.599 --> 07:14.999
But bodie's doing a line indoc
with a new fo

07:15.035 --> 07:17.335
And I could use some backup.
- Another one?

07:17.371 --> 07:18.870
- It's hard to fill
chopper's shoes.

07:18.906 --> 07:22.139
- Well, he is chopper.
And an astronaut.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.475
- Almost astronaut.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.143
The pilots are calling
this new guy "skippy"

07:25.278 --> 07:27.278
So I am not optimistic.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.481
- Hey, nurse tristan!

07:30.750 --> 07:32.417
- Skippy, right? I'm hayley.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.152
- It's reese, actually.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.688
- Wait, I thought
your last name was hassan?

07:36.690 --> 07:39.090
- Well, you know pilots.
I got reese's pieces

07:39.092 --> 07:42.160
In flight school,
then it became peanut butter...

07:42.295 --> 07:44.095
And then my jackass
flight partner

07:44.131 --> 07:46.030
Went to skippy and it stuck.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.167
(hayley chuckling)

07:50.237 --> 07:53.171
Anyway, uh,
I got the gear loaded,

07:53.173 --> 07:55.106
I grabbed us all some coffee.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.542
Uh, I got the heads-up.
Bodie can be bought.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.711
- Nice.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.548
(rhythmic music)

08:07.988 --> 08:09.787
(plane roars)

08:09.823 --> 08:12.924
(baby cooing)

08:14.728 --> 08:16.328
- Turboprops make more
of a hum, bud.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.463
We'll work on it. Alright?

08:20.767 --> 08:22.166
(brakes squeal)

08:23.770 --> 08:28.340
- Hi! Sorry I'm late, bodie.
Did you have a good night?

08:28.475 --> 08:30.775
- Eh, I got four hours of sleep,
he got a little more.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.879
- Well, I had to hit the store
while joel's cereal's on sale.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.247
It's so expensive,

08:36.250 --> 08:37.749
And he's going
through it like water.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.086
Hi! Ready to go?
(cooing happily)

08:41.088 --> 08:43.822
Oh, I have to send some when
he starts daycare next week.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.423
You brought them the check,
right?

08:45.492 --> 08:46.758
If we lose this spot,
it'll be months

08:46.893 --> 08:48.026
Before another one opens up.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.493
- Yeah, madison.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.695
Dropped it off yesterday.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.163
We're good for when
your classes start.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.432
- Okay. Oh, I have mail for you.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.970
I had to update
your contact info.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.039
Donor screening called
on the home phone.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.441
I gave them your cell.
- Oh, um...

09:03.443 --> 09:05.377
- Right, I got screened
when joel was in the nicu

09:05.379 --> 09:07.579
In case he needed anything.
Uh... I'll give them a call,

09:07.581 --> 09:08.913
Tell them to take me
off their list.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.515
- Okay.
- Alright.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.117
Wheels up in ten.
Be good for mom, okay, buddy?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.586
Bye.
(baby cooing)

09:15.322 --> 09:17.922
(sirens wailing)

09:19.526 --> 09:21.192
- Yeah, the other students
warned me.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.928
I heard she's a total hardass.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.262
The word is, "perfect"
isn't good enough for yana.

09:25.299 --> 09:26.764
I go with an under-serviced
backwater

09:26.833 --> 09:28.266
For the brownie points,
and get stuck

09:28.401 --> 09:29.968
With a self-important bitch.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.205
- Or. Dr. Noah's one of
the most respected

09:34.274 --> 09:36.608
Emergency medicine doctors
in the province,

09:36.743 --> 09:39.477
And she expects everyone
to come up to her level?

09:39.479 --> 09:41.680
You don't last in
an "under-serviced backwater"

09:41.682 --> 09:43.514
If you don't know your shit
and everyone else's.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.152
- 63-year-old male
with history of copd,

09:47.154 --> 09:50.021
Complains of three days
of shortness of breath.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.224
Mr. Rodman. First steps?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.293
- Chest exam.
- If you will.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.762
(breathing heavily)

09:57.764 --> 10:01.299
Note the extended
anterior-posterior diameter,

10:01.434 --> 10:05.236
Or "barrel chest"
in a classic copd presentation.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.571
(coughing)
- whoa!

10:07.608 --> 10:08.773
Watch his airway.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.108
Light taps,

10:10.177 --> 10:13.311
Fingers in the intercostal
spaces, like this.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.518
Or however dr. Noah prefers.

10:20.554 --> 10:24.121
- You must be ms. Highway.
Our infamous flight nurse.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.324
I've heard about your exploits
with duct tape.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.059
- Gotta make do with
what we have, right?

10:28.095 --> 10:29.661
- Right.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.429
(paramedic): Incoming,
50-year-old male,

10:31.564 --> 10:32.897
Cardiac arrest.

10:34.868 --> 10:35.967
- Jeremy?

10:37.104 --> 10:39.070
- Crys, hey.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.406
Uh, this isn't what
it looks like. I'm...

10:43.810 --> 10:45.877
Actually, it is.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.147
- You've been back all this time
and you didn't tell me?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.650
You just disappeared,
and then, what, you show up

10:51.785 --> 10:53.350
At my job,
dressed as a paramedic?

10:53.387 --> 10:55.753
- I'm not dressed as anything,
crys.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.356
I'm training as a pcp.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.226
- What the hell, jer?

11:01.361 --> 11:02.694
- I got back
a couple months ago,

11:02.829 --> 11:04.696
And I signed up
at the academy.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.365
- A paramedic?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.100
Don't you think
that's a little...

11:10.170 --> 11:12.303
Serious, for you?

11:12.305 --> 11:14.238
If you think you need
to do this to impress me,

11:14.307 --> 11:15.606
Then--
- what?

11:16.977 --> 11:19.110
You know, not everything
is about you, crys.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.846
- Yeah. You made that clear.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.248
I said I love you.

11:26.119 --> 11:29.253
And you know what? It's taken
me six months to realize...

11:30.924 --> 11:32.590
You never said it back.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.595
You know what,
it doesn't matter. Just...

11:37.597 --> 11:39.063
(scoffs)

11:40.834 --> 11:42.267
(door closes)

11:44.137 --> 11:45.203
(sighs)

11:45.205 --> 11:49.140
(tense instrumental music)

11:57.484 --> 11:59.117
<i> - We just worry about you.</i>

11:59.119 --> 12:01.652
<i> The overtime's good,</i>
<i> but you've been at it 36 hours</i>

12:01.722 --> 12:03.521
<i> Now without a break.</i>
- People count on me

12:03.523 --> 12:05.523
To clear access roads, hon.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.025
Four more hours,
I'll be home,

12:07.160 --> 12:09.494
Get some sleep before
that alberta clipper sets in.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.696
<i> - Okay. Well, text when</i>
<i> you're heading home.</i>

12:11.698 --> 12:13.031
<i> Lily will want to see</i>
<i> you before bed.</i>

12:13.166 --> 12:14.932
(chuck groans)
<i> chuck?</i>

12:14.968 --> 12:16.968
<i> Are you okay? Chuck?</i>

12:18.004 --> 12:20.505
<i> Chuck! Are you there?</i>

12:20.640 --> 12:22.173
<i> Chuck!</i>

12:22.209 --> 12:24.375
(plane roaring)

12:24.377 --> 12:26.778
(tense music)

12:36.222 --> 12:37.588
- Chuck?

12:38.625 --> 12:40.124
We're from skymed,
we're here to help.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.359
- Wh-what's happening?

12:42.395 --> 12:45.163
- You had an accident.
Do you know where you are?

12:47.934 --> 12:49.066
- I hit a tree?

12:49.102 --> 12:51.803
(scoffs)
I was talking on my phone...

12:51.938 --> 12:54.138
I must've run off the road,
knocked myself out.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.074
- Mmm, I don't think...

12:56.209 --> 12:57.675
This would knock you out.

12:57.811 --> 13:01.279
Have you lost
consciousness before?

13:01.348 --> 13:03.915
(birds chirping)

13:05.785 --> 13:08.086
It's okay.
I'm just here to help.

13:08.088 --> 13:11.289
But I can do that a lot better
if I have all the information.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.826
- Last week. I suddenly
felt really weak,

13:14.961 --> 13:16.294
When I was shoveling the drive.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.429
I thought I was just
overdoing it.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.532
I've been putting in long hours.
But uh...

13:21.601 --> 13:25.102
Then a couple of my fingers
went numb.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.371
My arm wouldn't work.
It was just hanging.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.173
- Okay. Give my hands
a squeeze my hands.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.710
And this numbness,
it's just on the one side?

13:33.847 --> 13:34.979
And you haven't seen a doctor?

13:35.048 --> 13:36.547
- It always goes away.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.516
I really need this job.

13:39.553 --> 13:41.920
I got laid off from the plant
a couple months ago.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.855
I've got a little girl.

13:43.924 --> 13:47.125
- Chuck, I think you're having
what's called t.I.A.S,

13:47.127 --> 13:49.126
Transient ischemic attacks,

13:49.162 --> 13:51.195
Like a warning sign
for a stroke.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.664
Definitely something you need
to see a doctor for.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.733
- Give me a hand
with the backboard.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.502
- When I got on medevacs,

13:57.637 --> 13:59.403
I was worried I'd freeze up
on calls like this.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.174
But now I'm just freezing.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.943
(birds chirping)

14:08.248 --> 14:10.114
(soft music)

14:10.984 --> 14:12.684
Listen, tristan...

14:13.587 --> 14:15.987
That day in the locker room...

14:16.122 --> 14:17.689
Hey, we don't have
to talk about what happened.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.157
I know you're with someone, now.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.960
As long as nowak's cool--
- nowak doesn't know.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.528
And I want to keep it that way.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.233
- Okay, chuck. Come on down.
Just be careful, here.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.468
One big step.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.570
(grunting)

14:32.572 --> 14:34.305
Tristan, shoulder!

14:34.341 --> 14:35.440
- Okay.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.241
I got you, chuck.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.575
(chuck): I feel weak.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.111
(tristan): We'll get you
on the board.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.612
(reese): Whoa.
Where'd all this come from?

14:42.649 --> 14:43.948
Oh, my god.

14:44.851 --> 14:45.917
(hayley): The plow hit someone.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.585
- I got it, I got it.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.954
- What have I done?
- I got a pulse.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.622
We gotta get him out, now!

14:51.691 --> 14:53.124
(hayley): Tristan, his leg!

15:02.068 --> 15:04.035
(rock music)

15:07.674 --> 15:11.142
- Nope. That's two trips.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.745
- Is that the new girl?
- They're all new.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.614
We can't keep the place staffed.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.350
- Guess who made it
to the final 16?

15:19.485 --> 15:21.352
- Hell yeah, he did!
Way to go, chops.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.655
(cheering)
- coming with style, baby.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.760
(all cheering)

15:28.895 --> 15:30.761
(laughing)

15:30.797 --> 15:32.630
- Well, that's one less room
to worry about...

15:32.699 --> 15:34.932
- What's up, wheez?
Chopper says hi.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.234
- Yeah, he does,
I'm his favorite!

15:37.270 --> 15:39.837
Hey, don't feel bad,
you're a distant second.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.372
Top ten, for sure.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.841
- Eh...
Is this the new crew house?

15:43.843 --> 15:46.144
- I gotta figure out a way
to squeeze in

15:46.146 --> 15:49.246
All the manitoba crews
and the new ontario crew.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.382
You kids,
you all like bed-hopping,

15:51.517 --> 15:52.717
Until it's actually
time to sleep,

15:52.719 --> 15:53.952
Then you all want
your own rooms.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.453
- Tristan and I can
share a room.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.321
- What?!

15:57.557 --> 15:59.256
- I mean, we sleep together
most nights anyway.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.993
- Yeah, but we never
talked about it, nowak.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.662
Moving in together is kinda
something you talk about first.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.532
- Okay, so let's talk about it.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.800
You want to move in together?

16:12.005 --> 16:13.337
- Uh...

16:15.909 --> 16:18.876
- Uh... Yep, right.
I'm short on the bar, so...

16:18.878 --> 16:20.044
- Nowak...

16:21.848 --> 16:23.314
- Hey, buddy.
Give me a drink.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.216
- I thought things
were good with you guys?

16:26.252 --> 16:28.619
- They were. They are.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.155
It's just, I like knowing
that I have my own room

16:31.157 --> 16:32.890
If I need it, just in case.

16:32.926 --> 16:35.192
You know, like an escape hatch,
or something.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.696
- Nowak does not trust easily.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.498
So when he commits,
there's no "escape hatch".

16:41.534 --> 16:42.967
And if you're not ready
for that...

16:45.739 --> 16:47.171
- Want a beer?

16:47.240 --> 16:48.673
(rhythmic music)

16:48.808 --> 16:51.142
- Aperol spritz, easy soda.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.843
- Toronto or vancouver?

16:52.879 --> 16:54.245
- Toronto. How'd you know?

16:54.247 --> 16:56.748
- Closest we get to aperol
around here is vodka.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.382
But I can put a lime in it,
for you.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.850
- Nah, hold the lime.

17:00.754 --> 17:02.453
And the soda.

17:07.494 --> 17:08.259
Boss.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.130
(indistinct chatter)

17:14.401 --> 17:15.299
- You know, lex...

17:16.403 --> 17:18.469
As a bartender,
"hi, my name's lexi"

17:18.505 --> 17:19.670
Works just fine.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.105
Trust me.
- I...

17:22.341 --> 17:23.875
- Lex, come on.
You got two types, okay?

17:24.010 --> 17:27.278
You got lumberjacks,
and girls like that.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.549
- I'm not dating right now.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.051
I gotta focus on the gig,

17:33.186 --> 17:34.751
With skymed expanding
and everything.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.354
- Hmm.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.424
(glass shattering)

17:40.493 --> 17:42.092
(gasping, guest chattering)

17:42.128 --> 17:43.094
Whoa.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.063
- I'm a nurse, you need to sit.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.363
- I got you.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.900
I got you, hang on.
Can I borrow that?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.038
(rhythmic music)

17:54.173 --> 17:55.573
(woman gasping)
alright. Keep breathing.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.908
You're alright. Keep breathing.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.510
In and out. In and out.
There you go.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.579
Arm up. Alright.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.247
Help me out, call an ambulance?

18:03.283 --> 18:06.184
Slowly. There you go.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.785
Alright, you're okay.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.788
- That was... Fast.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.757
- I don't think she
was disappointed.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.992
- Oh yeah. Everyone,

18:15.028 --> 18:18.062
This is stef.
The new ontario paramedic.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.797
- Yeah, she's definitely
your type.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.941
(indistinct chatter)

18:31.878 --> 18:33.344
(distant phones ringing)

18:33.346 --> 18:34.745
(sighs)

18:34.814 --> 18:36.614
- Did you know jeremy's training
to be a paramedic?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.415
- What?

18:38.485 --> 18:39.383
- He showed up this afternoon

18:39.519 --> 18:40.918
With an mi and a uniform.

18:40.954 --> 18:41.952
- Whoa.

18:43.857 --> 18:46.057
I thought he was out hunting?

18:46.059 --> 18:47.291
- So did I.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.427
(sighs)
- crys.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.430
I have to go check on
a patient I just brought in,

18:52.565 --> 18:55.099
But after that, I am off.
We can go get drinks.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.169
- The plow driver?
He's going home.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.904
- Why aren't they sending him

18:59.973 --> 19:01.838
To the stroke centre
in winnipeg?

19:01.875 --> 19:03.908
His symptoms indicate t.I.A.S.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.709
- Dr. Yana ordered a ct
and a transfer,

19:05.778 --> 19:07.178
But he refused both.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.512
He's denying any history
of symptoms,

19:08.548 --> 19:09.780
They're discharging him ama.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.248
(sighs)

19:14.020 --> 19:15.319
- You don't get it.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.121
It was bad enough
when I just thought I was gonna

19:17.256 --> 19:20.090
Lose my license,
but I actually hurt someone.

19:21.928 --> 19:25.029
If there's a chance that
I knew I was sick,

19:25.098 --> 19:27.064
That I knew
I shouldn't be driving,

19:27.100 --> 19:28.399
I could go to jail.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.334
- The skier should
make a full recovery.

19:30.469 --> 19:32.870
- He lost his leg.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.405
And that's my fault.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.675
I was sick, but I didn't
pay any attention to the signs

19:38.711 --> 19:41.011
Because I couldn't lose my job
and let my family down.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.681
But if I go to jail...

19:43.750 --> 19:45.583
If I'm not there
to take care of them...

19:46.485 --> 19:47.618
(sighs)

19:47.687 --> 19:51.188
I need this out
so I can go home. Please.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.693
(soft music)

19:55.762 --> 19:57.695
- Look...

19:57.697 --> 19:59.530
I know how it feels
to not be there

19:59.665 --> 20:01.365
When someone needed you.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.334
Especially someone you love.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.871
But if you don't take
care of yourself now, chuck...

20:08.975 --> 20:10.574
They could lose you.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.579
- No.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.513
I want to ger--

20:16.515 --> 20:17.815
(medical machines beeping)
- facial droop.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.984
He's having a stroke.
- He needs tpa.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.252
- Stay with us, chuck,
stay with us.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.555
(medical machines beeping)

20:28.695 --> 20:30.394
Come on, crystal. Hurry.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.530
- Hang on, just hang on.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.398
(tense music)

20:40.339 --> 20:42.406
- Ms. Highway. Stand down.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.278
Send this man
for an emergency ct.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.414
- The patient presented
with classic stroke indicators,

20:50.483 --> 20:52.949
No history of trauma
or recent surgery.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.685
Receiving tpa now could
make all the difference.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.821
- Or it could've killed him.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.756
The patient refused a ct.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.291
We don't know
if he has a bleed.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.160
And that is why
it's hospital protocol

21:03.296 --> 21:06.397
Not to administer
tpa without a ct.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.633
- I've administered tpa
many times

21:09.702 --> 21:11.168
In the field for stemis.

21:11.170 --> 21:13.571
- Not in a hospital,
where you are still a student.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.906
Tpa is given for stemis
in the field

21:15.975 --> 21:19.510
Because the criteria
is easier to evaluate.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.712
Yes, ms. Highway,

21:21.748 --> 21:24.314
You have a lot of experience
in the field

21:24.350 --> 21:26.984
Where your only responsibility
is to keep patients alive

21:27.053 --> 21:28.985
Until you can get them
to a doctor.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.654
But doctors' responsibilities

21:30.723 --> 21:33.324
Are to keep patients alive,
period.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.059
And if we can't,

21:35.061 --> 21:37.128
We have to look that man's
family in the eye

21:37.263 --> 21:39.329
And explain to them
what went wrong.

21:39.365 --> 21:42.066
You have to tell them
why you chose

21:42.201 --> 21:43.868
Not to follow the rules

21:44.003 --> 21:46.003
When their father's life
was in your hands.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.208
You're on the ground now,
ms. Highway.

21:51.244 --> 21:53.077
And if you want to stay there,

21:53.079 --> 21:56.380
I suggest you follow the rules.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.818
Let's go.
Get him to imaging.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.365
Honestly, it's cool.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.834
We don't have to share a room.
It was just to help wheezer.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.103
- It's not that I don't want

22:19.105 --> 22:20.304
To move in with you,
it's just...

22:20.373 --> 22:21.906
I've just never
lived with anyone before.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.240
I don't want to mess this up.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.377
- It's all good, man.

22:26.379 --> 22:27.444
I'm still down the hall.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.649
(indistinct chatter)

22:32.819 --> 22:34.585
- Wait.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.887
Let's just do it,
let's move in together.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.224
You're the only person I want
to share space with, nowak.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.427
Cold ham and cheese.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.197
<i> - Kocham cie,</i> too.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.004
- Hey, nowak.

22:55.308 --> 22:57.074
- Skippy!

22:57.143 --> 22:58.876
Welcome to the big leagues.

22:58.945 --> 23:01.311
- Almost, just gotta get
through my line check.

23:01.381 --> 23:04.148
- Wait... You two
know each other?

23:04.217 --> 23:05.916
- We were partners
in flight school.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.317
- So you're the one
who nicknamed him skippy?

23:07.387 --> 23:09.553
- Yeah, this is the jerk
who convinced me

23:09.622 --> 23:11.489
To move to thompson too,
in winter.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.757
- Yeah, and now you're an fo.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.092
C'mon, let's get you moved in.

23:16.129 --> 23:17.962
Come on, I've scoped out
your room.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.763
You're at the top of the stairs.

23:19.766 --> 23:20.831
- Sweet!

23:20.833 --> 23:23.234
(indistinct chatter)

23:23.369 --> 23:26.303
(rhythmic music)

23:34.246 --> 23:36.180
- Setting the bar
pretty high, huh?

23:36.315 --> 23:39.449
Getting to fly my first medevac
on a new plane

23:39.485 --> 23:42.052
With skymed's famous girl pilot.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.454
Got any tips?

23:43.589 --> 23:45.656
- I don't know about famous,
but I'm your girl.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.426
Pilot. Your girl pilot.

23:49.561 --> 23:51.328
Uh, don't forget the patients,

23:51.464 --> 23:53.531
Don't forget the medics,
don't forget to pee?

23:53.666 --> 23:55.065
(chuckling)

23:55.101 --> 23:56.600
- I heard the north's intense.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.735
But my first call's
just a fever.

23:58.737 --> 24:00.871
I hope it's not
always so quiet?

24:01.006 --> 24:02.773
- I'm sure you'll get
some action.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.909
- Promise, first officer lexi?

24:11.550 --> 24:13.817
- Woo-wee!

24:13.886 --> 24:15.986
I think I'm in love.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.822
This baby's so new,
I wanna burp it and spank it.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.559
- I thought chief pilots
didn't have to fly medevacs?

24:21.561 --> 24:23.894
- Yeah, but I'm a pilot first,
boss second.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.897
Plus someone's gotta keep
an eye on you kids...

24:26.899 --> 24:28.332
Famous girl pilot.

24:30.703 --> 24:31.835
(wheezer laughing)

24:31.904 --> 24:33.203
I hear everything.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.774
(whispering): Focus, cadet.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.142
(plane roaring)

24:42.248 --> 24:44.748
(rhythmic music)

24:44.784 --> 24:46.417
(stef): Dale?
(knocking)

24:46.419 --> 24:48.819
Dale? It's skymed,
we're here to help.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.257
(soft tense music)

24:53.259 --> 24:55.659
(wind howling)

24:58.197 --> 25:01.131
(lexi): What kind of call
did you say this was again?

25:01.200 --> 25:04.034
- Fever. Patient got bit
by his dog or something.

25:05.070 --> 25:07.338
(glass crunching)

25:07.340 --> 25:08.606
Oh...

25:08.741 --> 25:10.674
- Yeah, this is for sure
a murder house.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.911
Ladies, go first.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.814
- Dale? I'm stef,
I'm a paramedic.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.515
We got a call that you're sick?

25:18.518 --> 25:20.084
- These are aquariums?

25:20.219 --> 25:22.419
Huh. Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.690
(sinister music)

25:26.759 --> 25:28.825
(hissing)
oh my--

25:28.827 --> 25:32.228
Oh god, are these all snakes?

25:32.265 --> 25:34.832
- Some of them are empty, now.
Dale?

25:38.504 --> 25:41.305
- This is the dog bite? A snake?

25:41.307 --> 25:42.840
- Jenny's a coral snake.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.577
Um, u-usually,
she's so docile and cuddly.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.646
But when I went to take her
out of her tank yesterday,

25:49.782 --> 25:52.783
She... I mean,
she's never struck before.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.851
So, I was surprised,
and I dropped her,

25:54.887 --> 25:56.654
And then I broke a bunch
of the other girls' tanks...

25:56.789 --> 25:58.188
- You got a bunch
of venomous snakes

25:58.224 --> 25:59.456
Running around this place?

25:59.458 --> 26:00.791
(hissing)
- oh! Okay, okay, I...

26:00.860 --> 26:02.258
Definitely felt
something slither

26:02.295 --> 26:04.328
Over my foot right there.
- No, no, I turned the heat off,

26:04.397 --> 26:06.263
Which makes 'em all sluggish,
you know,

26:06.332 --> 26:08.065
So I... So I could
catch them all.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.833
I mean, except for the ones

26:09.835 --> 26:12.803
That didn't survive
the crash... Or the cold.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.538
My jenny...
- Ooh...

26:14.673 --> 26:16.340
- She'd froze,
by the time I found her.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.777
- I'm sorry.
Okay, let me see.

26:22.515 --> 26:24.214
Okay, how long ago
were you bitten, dale?

26:24.350 --> 26:25.816
I don't carry antivenom
in my kit.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.084
- Well, I took some yesterday.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.520
But then I started
getting the chills.

26:29.522 --> 26:32.689
- Yeah, this looks infected.
You need antibiotics,

26:32.725 --> 26:33.824
And this should be debrided.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.492
Why didn't you go
to the hospital, dale?

26:35.494 --> 26:37.327
- Well, they...
They'd find out about

26:37.363 --> 26:38.896
My collection.

26:38.898 --> 26:41.699
I mean, m-most
of these girls are...

26:41.834 --> 26:43.567
They're not legal.

26:43.702 --> 26:45.769
So they're just gonna go ahead
and put 'em down.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.304
You know, so...
I mean, it's hard enough

26:47.439 --> 26:48.872
For me losing my poor jenny.
- Okay.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.708
- You know, I can't...
- I get it.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.709
I get it.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.144
Um...

26:54.146 --> 26:56.246
Okay, can we try to find
the heat, wheezer?

26:56.248 --> 26:58.048
We don't want the patient
freezing. Let's find the...

26:58.183 --> 26:59.650
- Yeah, I'm on it. Yep.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.655
- Why would anyone buy
a pet that can kill them?

27:04.657 --> 27:07.424
- I don't know, isn't it
a little bit exciting

27:07.559 --> 27:09.193
Being so close to danger?

27:09.328 --> 27:11.729
You're a pilot,
isn't your job dangerous?

27:11.731 --> 27:13.997
- Not if you're doing it right.
(chuckles)

27:14.000 --> 27:15.799
Pilots like things safe.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.670
- Or maybe you just haven't been
taking the right risks?

27:21.140 --> 27:24.541
You might find you like dancing
with danger, first officer lexi.

27:24.577 --> 27:26.977
(rhythmic music)

27:29.481 --> 27:30.881
(exhales)

27:32.852 --> 27:36.120
- Nothing makes a real pilot
like bush flying.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.288
Tibsy mcfee lost his leg
to a propellor,

27:38.357 --> 27:40.424
But he kept a medical
to fly cargo

27:40.426 --> 27:42.426
With this manky
old prosthetic, and every time

27:42.561 --> 27:44.294
A greenhorn came up to ramp,

27:44.363 --> 27:45.896
He'd pop off his leg,

27:45.898 --> 27:48.565
He'd wipe out the smooge,
pour vodka in,

27:48.601 --> 27:49.733
And make a newb do a shot.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.470
- Yeah... When you say "smooge".

27:53.539 --> 27:55.205
- Mm-hmm!
- Ugh...

27:55.207 --> 27:57.174
- My throat...
My throat's tight.

27:57.243 --> 28:00.443
Feels like...
Feels like someone's choking me.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.446
- Alright.

28:02.448 --> 28:03.714
(hissing)

28:04.717 --> 28:05.783
Jenny!

28:05.918 --> 28:08.051
- Uh... Snake!

28:08.054 --> 28:09.419
We got a snake on the plane!

28:09.422 --> 28:11.521
(both): What?!
- She wasn't dead!

28:11.590 --> 28:13.523
She must've warmed up
when you turned the heat on,

28:13.592 --> 28:15.225
And she got in my sleeping bag.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.194
- Okay, but where is she?

28:17.329 --> 28:18.695
- I-I don't know.
I don't know.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.130
- She's probably just scared,
right?

28:20.265 --> 28:21.665
She'll probably just look
for somewhere safe

28:21.734 --> 28:23.200
To curl up and hide?

28:23.202 --> 28:25.269
- I don't have antivenom.
We're 40 minutes

28:25.404 --> 28:27.204
From the nearest hospital.
If it bites anyone...

28:31.810 --> 28:33.276
(tense music)

28:34.279 --> 28:36.480
I think it went
under the stretcher.

28:36.615 --> 28:37.948
(hissing)
oh!

28:38.917 --> 28:40.650
(lexi): What's happening?
- Okay...

28:40.686 --> 28:42.219
- What's going on back there,
stef?

28:43.422 --> 28:46.022
You have control.
- I have control.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.091
- Hang on, I'm coming back.

28:48.694 --> 28:49.960
Hang on.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.996
(tense music)

28:52.998 --> 28:54.098
- Seriously?

28:55.634 --> 28:56.900
There, down there.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.506
- Okay...

29:02.575 --> 29:04.474
(stef): Oh god, lexi,
be careful.

29:04.477 --> 29:08.311
(snake hissing)

29:08.347 --> 29:10.079
- Got it! Okay.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.048
I just need something
with a lid.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.017
- Uh...

29:14.019 --> 29:15.252
The commissary bucket?

29:15.387 --> 29:18.522
- You're gonna trap
a venomous snake in lunch bag?

29:21.293 --> 29:23.059
Jesus, don't bring it up here!

29:23.095 --> 29:24.595
- Dump the cabin, wheez!
- What?

29:24.730 --> 29:26.864
- Dump the cabin!
- Alright, everybody hold on

29:26.999 --> 29:28.198
To your sinuses!

29:28.267 --> 29:30.333
(air whooshing)

29:32.872 --> 29:35.005
(hissing)

29:38.677 --> 29:39.476
- Jenny!

29:41.013 --> 29:42.146
(hissing)

29:42.281 --> 29:44.881
- Now that was some real
bush pilot shit.

29:46.185 --> 29:47.484
Not bad, kid.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.020
(laughing)

29:51.056 --> 29:52.455
- Not bad at all.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.424
(exhales)

29:57.930 --> 29:59.696
- Your check bounced.

29:59.765 --> 30:01.431
The daycare deposit
didn't go through.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.833
- What? No, I had m...

30:04.703 --> 30:06.102
The car payment.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.638
I forgot that it came out
this week.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.239
Look, if they can wait
until my next pay period--

30:09.241 --> 30:10.707
- No, if they don't
get it today,

30:10.709 --> 30:12.242
Joel will lose his place.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.710
Can you pick up
a shift or something?

30:13.712 --> 30:15.178
Get an advance from wheezer?

30:15.214 --> 30:17.748
- The expansion, new hires...
There's a freeze on ot...

30:17.883 --> 30:19.616
What about the credit card?
- It's maxed.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.986
Groceries, diapers, it all costs
a lot more up here.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.521
Bodie, I really need
this daycare

30:25.558 --> 30:27.925
So that I can start my course,
so that I can get a better job.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.459
So things like this
don't happen.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.795
- I know, mads.
And I want that for you.

30:33.298 --> 30:35.799
- Maybe... You can ask
your parents?

30:37.870 --> 30:39.336
I know things
are tough with them.

30:39.471 --> 30:40.671
But you have a son now.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.540
Maybe they can help.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.276
- Look, I'll figure
something out.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.212
Okay? I promise.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.153
(tense music)

31:00.926 --> 31:03.360
(air hissing through mask)

31:13.205 --> 31:15.372
(beeping)

31:26.852 --> 31:28.785
(air hissing through mask)

31:47.373 --> 31:49.272
(tense music)

31:59.151 --> 32:00.550
(beeping)

32:08.294 --> 32:09.760
(beeping rapidly)

32:09.762 --> 32:12.029
(gasping deeply)

32:34.453 --> 32:36.119
- I hope you still
like hazelnut,

32:36.254 --> 32:38.255
Because the lady at tim's
had a heavy pour.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.323
- I thought you didn't
drink coffee?

32:40.359 --> 32:42.859
- I didn't.
But... Med school.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.796
- Are we expecting a lot
of thyroid patients today?

32:47.700 --> 32:49.332
- Endocrinology exam.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.535
If I'm lucky,
and we don't get any calls

32:51.537 --> 32:53.636
So I can study,
I might actually pass it.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.806
Especially after I blew
my first day of clinical.

32:56.842 --> 33:00.276
- I called the hospital.
Chuck's ct scan came back clear.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.746
You were right to give him tpa.
He didn't have a bleed.

33:03.582 --> 33:04.914
- What if he had?

33:04.950 --> 33:06.616
- Crystal. You're a good nurse.

33:06.752 --> 33:08.685
The only thing that's gonna
change when you're a doctor

33:08.820 --> 33:10.353
Is that you're finally gonna
get credit for everything

33:10.422 --> 33:12.222
You already know how to do.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.557
- What if I don't?

33:13.692 --> 33:15.158
What if I only think I know?

33:15.728 --> 33:18.562
(pagers beeping)

33:18.564 --> 33:20.063
(sighs)

33:22.300 --> 33:24.067
There goes endocrinology.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.505
(soft music)

33:41.119 --> 33:43.853
- An ice fisher saw
the smoke from a lake.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.522
He isn't one of ours.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.157
- What happened?

33:47.292 --> 33:49.459
- Looks like his propane
stove blew.

33:51.296 --> 33:54.064
- He was thrown pretty far
when the tower blew.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.066
We could be looking
at internal injuries.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.533
- Hr's high.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.236
Why was he wearing this?

33:59.238 --> 34:01.037
Looks like some sort
of oxygen mask.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.606
- A lot of shrapnel, left side.

34:04.843 --> 34:06.676
Is there something familiar
about this guy to you?

34:12.351 --> 34:14.050
(tense music)

34:17.823 --> 34:19.889
Chopper?
- Oh, my god.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.109
This doesn't make any sense.

34:40.145 --> 34:42.779
He's supposed to be at
selection camp in montreal.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.380
He was one of the final 16.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.583
What was he doing at a fire
tower in northern manitoba?

34:46.585 --> 34:48.251
- The percussive force alone

34:48.320 --> 34:49.619
From the explosion
could've killed him.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.923
- You guys are tight, right?

34:53.959 --> 34:55.258
Did you know he was back?

34:57.129 --> 34:58.995
- That alberta clipper
came in hard.

34:59.064 --> 35:01.131
Alright, better strap in.
Pireps say it's a bumpy ride

35:01.200 --> 35:02.765
All the way to thompson.

35:03.368 --> 35:04.501
(gasps)

35:04.570 --> 35:06.002
- Chopper?

35:06.004 --> 35:07.036
(bodie): He's awake?

35:07.072 --> 35:08.471
(crystal): Hi, buddy.

35:08.474 --> 35:10.173
Do you know where you are?

35:11.977 --> 35:13.977
(bodie): What's going on?
What's happening?

35:13.979 --> 35:15.412
- Muffled heart sounds...

35:15.414 --> 35:17.547
- Pulsus paradoxus,

35:17.583 --> 35:19.916
Bp's dropping, hr too.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.317
(bodie): Is he okay?

35:21.386 --> 35:23.053
(crystal): Jvd...

35:23.055 --> 35:24.654
God, it's cardiac tamponade.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.489
(bodie): What is it,
what's going on?

35:26.492 --> 35:27.991
- Fluid's filling the sac
around his heart.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.492
It can happen
after chest trauma,

35:29.561 --> 35:31.027
He needs pericardiocentesis.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.162
- What's that?
- It's a needle

35:32.297 --> 35:33.763
Inserted into the sac to drain

35:33.832 --> 35:35.966
The fluid before he arrests.
- So do it!

35:35.968 --> 35:38.334
- This is something doctors
do in the hospital,

35:38.336 --> 35:40.036
With proper equipment.
- We were trained...

35:40.172 --> 35:42.305
- On the ground,
if there's no other option.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.107
Not in the back of a plane
with turbulence.

35:44.242 --> 35:46.476
- Get on the radio, ask centre
if there's a better ride.

35:46.611 --> 35:48.110
- We're still 45 minutes
from thompson.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.445
- Chopper doesn't have
45 minutes.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.814
It needs to be you,
you have more experience.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.082
- We don't have an ultrasound.

35:52.084 --> 35:53.650
I won't be able to see
what I'm doing.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.318
I could put the needle too far,

35:55.354 --> 35:57.820
I could kill the patient.
- The patient is chopper!

35:57.856 --> 35:59.522
- Winnipeg centre,
this is skymed 911

35:59.525 --> 36:01.024
Requesting deviations
for weather.

36:01.093 --> 36:04.160
(indistinct radio chatter)

36:04.196 --> 36:05.795
- Just do it!
- Do you know how dangerous

36:05.864 --> 36:08.398
This is? Even in a hospital,
with proper equipment!

36:08.400 --> 36:10.200
- This is family, crys.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.868
(beeping)

36:13.739 --> 36:15.005
- He's arresting.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.843
(hayley): Easy, easy...

36:22.614 --> 36:24.714
- Stop, you've gone too deep!

36:24.750 --> 36:27.016
- Shit! I can't!

36:27.052 --> 36:28.618
- Yes, you can. You can.
- I can't!

36:28.753 --> 36:29.953
It's not safe!
- You can do it!

36:30.022 --> 36:32.321
Crystal, look at me.
If I was in this medevac,

36:32.357 --> 36:34.390
If it was my life
in someone else's hands,

36:34.459 --> 36:37.027
You are the only person
I'd trust to do this.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.695
Okay? Chopper would too.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.695
You got this.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.764
(beeping)

36:41.800 --> 36:44.767
(plane roaring)

36:48.073 --> 36:49.172
Are we clear?

36:49.241 --> 36:50.507
(bodie): Just a break
in the weather.

36:50.642 --> 36:51.708
(reese): I can't see
any way around,

36:51.843 --> 36:53.276
We'll have to punch through.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.644
- We only have
a couple minutes,

36:54.646 --> 36:56.246
Whatever you're gonna do,
you need to do it now.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.381
- We take care of our own.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.583
(beeping)

37:01.420 --> 37:02.585
Come on, chopper.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.724
(plane roaring)

37:10.596 --> 37:11.661
- I'm in.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.096
- Only a few more seconds.

37:13.165 --> 37:14.631
- That's all we need.

37:17.469 --> 37:18.701
(beeping steadily)

37:18.770 --> 37:21.338
(hayley): He's got a pulse.
He's got a pulse!

37:21.473 --> 37:23.606
You're doing it, crystal,
you're saving his life.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.876
(crystal): Now we gotta
keep him alive.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.612
(tense music)

37:29.681 --> 37:32.315
25-year-old male,
blunt trauma to the chest,

37:32.317 --> 37:34.317
Developed cardiac tamponade
mid-flight.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.886
Pericardiocentesis drained
50 cc fluid.

37:37.022 --> 37:39.356
(soft music)

37:40.425 --> 37:42.025
- Oh, crystal,

37:42.027 --> 37:43.426
That was incredible.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.630
- I just got him here,
that's only the start.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.366
(dr. Yana): Pericardiocentesis.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.566
Impressive.

37:56.708 --> 37:59.375
- Look, I know you think
I shouldn't have done it.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.476
But...

38:01.713 --> 38:03.380
I am a good flight nurse,

38:03.515 --> 38:04.914
And chopper is my family,

38:04.916 --> 38:07.217
So if I'm gonna
answer to anyone, I--

38:07.219 --> 38:08.918
- I didn't say
I didn't think you could do it.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.854
I said you need
to follow the rules.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.290
- R-respectfully, dr. Noah.

38:14.326 --> 38:16.459
I've never been one
to stay in my lane.

38:16.594 --> 38:17.993
And I will always do
whatever it takes

38:18.030 --> 38:19.329
To help my patients.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.464
- Then that's why you owe it
to them and yourself

38:21.533 --> 38:22.832
To stay here.

38:25.070 --> 38:28.604
I was the only black woman
in my class in med school.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.140
And for the longest time,

38:30.275 --> 38:32.075
I was the only person
who looked like me

38:32.144 --> 38:35.010
Wearing a white coat
at the hospitals I worked at.

38:35.047 --> 38:36.880
This path is going to be hard.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.615
People are going to be
watching for you

38:38.750 --> 38:41.151
To make a mistake,
to do anything wrong.

38:42.421 --> 38:45.154
They're always looking
for reasons to kick us out.

38:46.358 --> 38:48.024
So don't give them any.

38:49.627 --> 38:51.794
(soft music)

39:06.578 --> 39:07.977
- If you're gonna sit out
in the cold,

39:07.979 --> 39:09.446
You might need some real heat.

39:09.581 --> 39:10.914
(chuckles)

39:12.050 --> 39:13.216
Here you go.

39:15.453 --> 39:17.920
- You know, I was there
when chopper found out

39:17.956 --> 39:19.589
He made it into selection camp.

39:21.093 --> 39:24.461
You have to be in top shape
just to pass a pilot's medical.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.396
I can't imagine
the rules for astronauts.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.732
- Hey, it's still early, okay?

39:28.867 --> 39:30.333
We have to wait
for the swelling to go down

39:30.468 --> 39:32.135
After surgery before
they can even evaluate

39:32.137 --> 39:34.103
The extent of the injuries.

39:35.807 --> 39:38.608
- He was in the final 16.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.344
You know, he was so close.

39:41.479 --> 39:45.148
His... Big dream since
he was a little kid,

39:45.150 --> 39:46.749
And...

39:46.752 --> 39:48.684
He actually had the guts
to go for it.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.888
- Don't you go
after your dreams?

39:52.824 --> 39:54.891
(sighs)

39:55.026 --> 39:58.294
- When it comes to flying,
yeah.

39:59.564 --> 40:02.098
When it comes
to everything else?

40:05.137 --> 40:07.437
(soft music)

40:13.645 --> 40:15.779
- You know, I love being
a first responder.

40:15.914 --> 40:19.181
First on the scene,
first to help,

40:19.217 --> 40:20.950
First to find a solution.

40:22.354 --> 40:24.787
Uh, but a cop told me once,
the first person

40:24.823 --> 40:26.923
Through the door's usually
the first to get shot, too.

40:29.327 --> 40:30.994
Hey.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.196
You gotta be brave
to be first.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.933
Like the first girl pilot
at an airline?

40:37.068 --> 40:38.468
(chuckling)

40:38.603 --> 40:40.603
I'm onto you, lexi martine.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.672
I think you might
secretly like danger.

40:42.807 --> 40:44.740
(laughing)

40:46.011 --> 40:47.142
(sighs)

40:47.179 --> 40:49.345
(soft music)

41:03.061 --> 41:06.629
- That... That's the thing
about girl pilots.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.567
I worked way too hard.

41:10.569 --> 41:14.370
Too hard to just
get distracted now.

41:14.372 --> 41:17.707
Even if I really want to.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.646
- Okay.

41:27.786 --> 41:30.719
- But if you think that
tough cadet vibe's

41:30.755 --> 41:32.789
Gonna turn me off,
you're wrong.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.063
(♪♪)

41:56.948 --> 41:58.881
- Is that baklava?

42:00.085 --> 42:01.584
Caught red-handed

42:01.586 --> 42:03.485
Trying to keep it
all to yourself.

42:03.522 --> 42:06.022
- Thought you said dessert
was for the weak?

42:06.024 --> 42:07.156
- Hmm...

42:10.362 --> 42:12.762
Not if it's baklava.

42:13.732 --> 42:16.098
Oh, yeah. That's good.

42:19.304 --> 42:20.903
(exhales)

42:25.343 --> 42:28.043
(vehicles passing)

42:28.079 --> 42:30.379
(phone ringing, buzzing)

42:32.250 --> 42:34.049
- Hello?
<i> (nurse): Austen bodie?</i>

42:34.085 --> 42:37.587
<i> Hi, I'm a donation coordinator</i>
<i> with donor screening canada.</i>

42:37.722 --> 42:40.523
- Yeah. Yeah, sorry,
I meant to call you.

42:40.592 --> 42:42.992
I got screened a while ago
when my son was in the nicu,

42:42.994 --> 42:44.994
But um, he's fine now, so...

42:45.129 --> 42:47.096
<i> - Well, you're a match</i>
<i> for a patient in toronto</i>

42:47.165 --> 42:48.398
<i> On a wait list for a kidney.</i>

42:48.533 --> 42:50.600
- I-I should've updated my file.

42:50.735 --> 42:53.069
Um, I'm a commercial pilot,
and I would love to help,

42:53.138 --> 42:54.671
But I have to prioritize
my medical.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.341
Since I have a family
to support.

42:58.476 --> 43:00.009
<i> - I understand.</i>

43:00.144 --> 43:01.678
<i> We were hoping</i>
<i> you might consider,</i>

43:01.680 --> 43:03.346
<i> Under the circumstances.</i>

43:03.415 --> 43:05.280
- What circumstances?

43:05.317 --> 43:07.150
<i> - I thought my colleague</i>
<i> explained.</i>

43:07.152 --> 43:09.885
<i> The recipient</i>
<i> is a close genetic relative.</i>

43:09.955 --> 43:13.189
(tense music)

43:19.831 --> 43:21.163
(sighs)

43:21.199 --> 43:22.365
- Anything yet?

43:22.500 --> 43:25.434
- Not until
the swelling comes down.

43:25.503 --> 43:27.036
But the surgeon said
it went well.
