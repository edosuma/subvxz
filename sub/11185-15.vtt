00:04.037 --> 00:06.846
I loved you, Tess. What's over is over.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.351
They got us, Hang on.

00:12.379 --> 00:15.792
With what she's got on us, they could
hang us all with the same rope.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.886
Do whatever is necessary to silence her.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.693
This lady's life is in great danger.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.932
Hang on.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.139
Can I have a light, man?

03:46.626 --> 03:47.764
Jim.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.237
You mean to tell me you saw nothing?

03:53.300 --> 03:54.438
Yes, sir.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.843
I mean, no sir. I mean, one minute
she was there and then she wasn't.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.783
Yeah, she just disappeared.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.922
You were responsible for her.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.827
You were responsible.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.822
Yes, sir.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.098
All right.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.899
All right.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.902
I have no tolerance for fools.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.675
Hello, String.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.446
Hawke, wait a minute. Wait, hold it.

05:40.540 --> 05:44.920
Would you have come if I told
you who you were going to pick up?

05:48.248 --> 05:50.455
Will someone tell me what's going on here?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.258
Who is this lady, anyway?

05:58.024 --> 05:59.833
6 years ago, I…

06:00.327 --> 06:02.364
I knew her as Tess Rogers.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.302
It's Mrs. Dixon now.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.035
Mrs. Dixon. Mrs. Cullen Dixon?

06:09.736 --> 06:11.238
He told you about us?

06:12.372 --> 06:15.842
No, I did some flying
for your husband one time.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.917
I still haven't been paid.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.119
Let me ask you something.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.286
What is one of the richest
men in America do’n

06:23.350 --> 06:27.423
let’n his wife gallivant around here
to meet the country's number one spy?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.868
Perhaps you should ask the spy.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.909
This is classified top secret.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.069
Even I don't have all the details.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.438
Michael, quit tap-dance’n,

06:43.637 --> 06:45.548
or Dom and I are gonna sit this one out.

06:45.605 --> 06:47.414
Okay, okay.

06:50.277 --> 06:53.315
A high-level Washington Investigative
Committee has been formed

06:53.380 --> 06:55.621
to hear testimony from Mrs. Dixon.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.863
She's agreed to appear at a
Hearing late this evening.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.423
In exchange for what?

07:04.724 --> 07:07.136
I'm afraid that's privileged information.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.471
Hawke, they put a lid on this one.

07:11.531 --> 07:14.102
Not even the President is talking to me.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.041
So what can you tell us?

07:20.440 --> 07:23.683
Only that the mission calls for
you to transport Mrs. Dixon

07:23.743 --> 07:26.587
to the Hearing by way of
a computerized flight plan

07:26.646 --> 07:29.559
that'll deliver you to
a classified location

07:29.616 --> 07:31.653
which will be transmitted in code

07:31.718 --> 07:35.131
to Airwolf's On-board Flight
Data System. That's all I…

07:35.188 --> 07:37.498
Hold it, hold it. Hold it right there.

07:38.124 --> 07:42.937
Are you saying that we'll be flying
automatic-pilot under Firm's control?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.777
No way, I don't like it, String.

07:49.869 --> 07:53.146
We get in trouble, we'll be
hang’n out there in our shorts.

07:53.506 --> 07:57.921
Who's to say it isn't some scheme cooked up
by the Firm to regain control of Airwolf?

07:57.978 --> 07:58.979
Me.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.855
All you've got is my word.

08:02.782 --> 08:05.888
And the fact that I do
know that this lady's life

08:05.952 --> 08:07.795
is in great danger, Hawke.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.672
Clothes you requested.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.202
Thank you.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.587
All systems green.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.569
Turbo's on the line, String.

09:15.355 --> 09:18.461
She can destroy years of work and planning.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.198
She may have already done so.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.605
I have been assured she hasn't
revealed any of our identities yet.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.006
You don't know that.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.011
I know she's running scared.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.411
And I know she doesn't know who to trust.

09:29.469 --> 09:32.245
If she's allowed to testify
before the Committee,

09:32.305 --> 09:35.377
none of us will ever see
the outside of a prison again.

09:36.476 --> 09:40.185
With what she's got on us, they could
hang us all with the same rope.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.622
Well gentlemen, you all know me

09:43.683 --> 09:47.324
as an ingenuous man,
so I'll be perfectly candid.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.700
What I am here, is a
man caught in the middle.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.196
God knows how crazy I am about her.

09:57.297 --> 10:01.609
I've seen the way you all looked at her
and the way every man looks at her.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.147
You all wanted her.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.143
But not in the way you wanted her.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.818
You wanted her the way you want everything.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.480
You had to possess it.

10:11.878 --> 10:15.690
But there's a lot more at stake here
than one more of your possessions.

10:19.352 --> 10:22.822
My ambitions have served me well, Mr. Kase.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.994
To be sure.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.306
You take pride in not being
hypocritical Barkley,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.638
so don't be sanctimonious.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.210
You wanna talk about greed,

10:37.670 --> 10:40.981
let's be truthful and admit
that that's why we're all here.

10:41.674 --> 10:44.951
This conversation has become
convoluted to the main issue.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.352
We should be talking about our survival.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.359
Gentlemen, to be honest,

10:49.415 --> 10:53.557
I'd do anything, anything
to have her back again.

10:54.354 --> 10:58.734
But I am sane enough to realize that
she can do us all irreparable harm.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.933
As much as I despise it,
I see no other recourse

11:03.997 --> 11:05.374
but to stop her.

11:06.799 --> 11:10.042
What I'm hearing here is a commitment
to do whatever is necessary

11:10.103 --> 11:11.411
to silence her.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.382
Is that what you're saying?

11:13.439 --> 11:16.215
Yes, I'm saying do what's necessary.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.116
Whatever's necessary.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.940
You know, I asked you
before to put these on.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.446
No, you told me.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.550
You're not used to being told.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.052
Just the opposite.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.581
Look, put 'em on.

11:52.679 --> 11:55.523
We've gotta have clear
communications, please.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.598
There now, isn't that better?

12:09.028 --> 12:11.269
Now, what’ll we talk about?

12:11.664 --> 12:14.201
How about what our position
is and where we're go’n?

12:14.267 --> 12:16.770
Well, we just cut inland
from the Gulf of Mexico.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.248
And according to the azimuth
and range resolution,

12:19.305 --> 12:23.685
we should be crossing Baja and entering
Southern California in about 5 minutes.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.255
And I'll say it again
String, I don't like this.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.088
I just don't like it one bit.

12:29.148 --> 12:32.186
Well, maybe you oughta call
up Michael and tell him again.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.732
I would if I thought it would do any good.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.335
We got company.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.909
2 HX-10 gunships on a closing course.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.003
Time to intercept?

12:50.069 --> 12:51.912
2 minutes 20 seconds.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.041
Armament?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.176
Either they're mighty serious

12:54.240 --> 12:57.119
or they're a flying advertisement
for “Missiles R Us.”

12:58.711 --> 13:00.247
They're serious.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.884
And they're sending us
a sample, air express.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.689
Give me a copper-head.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.291
By the numbers.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.904
Evade, evade.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.413
Evading.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.302
Who the hell are these guys, anyway?

13:49.362 --> 13:50.739
Your guess is as good as mine.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.846
All right, all right, attaboy String.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.102
You know, this cloak and dagger
stuff has gone far enough.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.803
Dom and my's butts are
on the line out there.

14:29.969 --> 14:31.073
Yeah, lady.

14:31.237 --> 14:35.185
And I'd kind of hate to lose mine on
account of we were up here flying blind.

14:35.241 --> 14:38.085
I wanna know what's going on
and I wanna know now.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.651
I guess I owe you both that much.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.693
You owe me a hell of a lot more than that.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.063
This'll do for a start.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.498
I'm sure they were after me.

14:53.192 --> 14:55.297
Looks like they want you pretty bad.

14:55.361 --> 14:56.362
Why?

14:57.997 --> 15:01.467
I… I can name names.

15:02.935 --> 15:04.141
Because I…

15:05.338 --> 15:10.287
I know about a conspiracy to assassinate
key international Heads of State.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.856
Including some of the highest-ranking
officials in Washington.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.159
A hit squad.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.997
You seem kinda surprised, Michael.

15:27.059 --> 15:28.402
I'm stunned.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.908
Particularly by the fact that they knew
where to try to make a hit on Airwolf.

15:31.964 --> 15:36.344
Well, we've been flying under your
computerized machine guidance system.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.042
If this is supposed to be such
a top-secret caper, Michael,

15:39.105 --> 15:41.915
why don't you go talk to some
of your people in the Firm?

15:41.974 --> 15:44.284
That is precisely what I'm going to do.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.956
Yeah well, meanwhile, we'll be
flying on our own flight plan.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.788
You call us when you find this leak.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.259
Talk to you later.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.902
All our radio communications
are being scrambled.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.205
And GCS is also encoding

16:05.264 --> 16:07.608
all command signals to
Airwolf's Flight Director

16:07.667 --> 16:09.510
via satellite transmissions.

16:10.236 --> 16:14.651
Then we'll start with our Ground Control
Station and talk to the Flight Controller.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.314
Call Security and have them meet me there.

16:17.376 --> 16:20.914
And then pull all the personnel
files on the GCS section.

16:34.393 --> 16:35.701
Pull.

16:39.465 --> 16:43.936
We may have underestimated the capabilities
of this machine they call Airwolf.

16:44.070 --> 16:48.485
From the after-action report, I'd say
you overestimated yours, Barkley.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.781
Pull.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.492
At this very moment,

16:55.615 --> 16:58.994
their position is being
transmitted to a 2nd fighter group.

16:59.418 --> 17:02.831
Do you have any ambivalence
connected with this, Barkley?

17:04.056 --> 17:06.627
I have no illusions about my part in this.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.536
I'm fully aware of my involvement.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.738
Your integrity will
probably kill you someday.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.407
Someday.

17:19.171 --> 17:20.479
Doubles.

17:22.508 --> 17:23.748
Pull.

17:30.182 --> 17:33.823
And Tess, how do you feel about her?

17:35.087 --> 17:38.068
God, I wish there were some other way.

17:39.358 --> 17:40.894
Yes, I'm sure.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.403
I understand you 2 were quite friendly.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.337
We talked.

17:46.832 --> 17:49.244
I was one of the few allowed that privilege.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.872
That's my mistake.

17:52.438 --> 17:55.146
There was never anything
but talk between us.

17:55.341 --> 17:58.618
Right. There was nothing more than
talk between her and the Arab.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.988
He's responsible for
what's happened right now.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.584
And I hold you responsible
for introducing them, Barkley.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.754
You got this whole thing twisted around.

18:05.818 --> 18:06.819
Have I?

18:06.886 --> 18:08.490
It was you who drove them together!

18:08.554 --> 18:10.659
It was him who tore us apart, Kase.

18:12.458 --> 18:16.235
If you'll excuse me, I've got to
see about picking up some pieces.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.076
Pull!

18:34.413 --> 18:36.450
I never saw you miss before, sir.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.966
Hey, you're not headed where
I think you are, are you?

18:44.490 --> 18:45.969
Can you think of a better place?

18:46.025 --> 18:47.060
What about her?

18:47.126 --> 18:49.697
I mean, take’n her in where the Lady sleeps?

18:49.862 --> 18:52.365
We'll just have to blindfold
her go’n in and come’n out.

18:52.431 --> 18:53.739
What are you talking about?

18:53.799 --> 18:56.541
About a nice, safe place for us to set down.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.176
While we get a few things ironed out.

18:59.605 --> 19:00.675
No.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.311
No, no way.

19:03.843 --> 19:08.019
Listen, I'm very sorry, but right now I
don't think you have any other choice.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.351
I should have known.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.520
I should have known something
like this was gonna happen.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.657
I knew it.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.632
I can't trust anybody. I want out of this.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.829
Set this thing down now. I want outta here!

19:19.892 --> 19:20.962
There's noth’n to be afraid of.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.370
Right, like those planes.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.463
What?

19:23.529 --> 19:25.770
Those planes, those damn planes.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.105
You think we had someth’n to do with them?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.201
How do I know?

19:28.267 --> 19:31.840
How do I know this whole thing isn't
just a set-up? How do I know?

19:32.138 --> 19:33.845
Now, you gotta be kid’n, lady.

19:33.906 --> 19:37.479
Look, how do I know it's not a set-up
to get me to talk before I can testify?

19:37.543 --> 19:39.955
Look, you said yourself there might
be a traitor inside the Firm.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.457
Well, how do I know it isn't you?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.255
We just dusted 2 planes.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.158
If all we wanted from you was information,

19:45.217 --> 19:47.322
we'd just hold a gun to your head.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.310
Hawke, this is Ground Control, come in.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.183
Hawke, this is Michael, come in.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.651
Go ahead, Michael.

20:10.009 --> 20:13.513
We have sufficient evidence to
believe we have our man in custody.

20:13.579 --> 20:17.026
Why is it then, Michael, that I
hear such reservations in your voice?

20:17.083 --> 20:19.962
Well, you know me Hawke, the eternal spy.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.759
I never believe anything until
I see it in black and white.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.768
Yeah, but you're ask’n us to.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.636
Hawke, I just got off the
phone with the White House.

20:27.693 --> 20:30.765
This thing has much bigger
implications than I thought.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.538
You're just gonna have to
trust me on this one.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.315
All right, Michael.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.184
We'll try it one more time.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.413
Dom, put us back on remote.

20:45.211 --> 20:48.590
But if you can't get us to the rendezvous
point, we'll just do it on our own.

20:48.647 --> 20:49.819
Fair enough.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.228
Okay Michael, she's all yours.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.753
You're making a big mistake.

21:22.615 --> 21:26.028
Look at the facts. You were the
Flight Control Officer on duty.

21:26.318 --> 21:28.161
You're having financial difficulties.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.063
I've got 2 ex-wives.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.359
You show me a guy with 2 ex-wives

21:32.424 --> 21:34.802
who's not having financial difficulties.

21:35.294 --> 21:39.242
So how does $50,000 suddenly show up
in your personal checking account

21:39.698 --> 21:42.304
2 days after you were given this assignment?

21:42.368 --> 21:44.678
I told you, I don't know
anything about that money.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.842
Now, this whole thing is a set-up.

21:47.239 --> 21:50.243
No one else inside the Firm
had access to the flight plan,

21:50.342 --> 21:51.844
including Archangel.

21:52.645 --> 21:56.650
But it was transmitted directly to
GCS from the Committee Headquarters

21:57.016 --> 22:00.862
on a 2-way data link system
with only a 15-second lead-time.

22:01.187 --> 22:05.192
Now you tell me how I could have relayed
that information out of here, huh?

22:09.195 --> 22:10.469
I have to admit

22:10.796 --> 22:12.969
we'll need more time to corroborate.

22:16.735 --> 22:19.648
They still got Flight Control.
How's the Lady do’n?

22:19.905 --> 22:22.647
Under the circumstances String, she's okay.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.717
Keep your eye on her, okay?

22:25.978 --> 22:26.979
Check.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.727
Pretty scared, aren't you?

22:42.294 --> 22:44.137
How come Cullen Dixon?

22:51.437 --> 22:53.110
You know me, String.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.843
I was raised on Hollywood movies.

22:59.144 --> 23:00.646
Hollywood yearnings.

23:03.749 --> 23:05.695
I wanted to be Grace Kelly.

23:10.422 --> 23:14.097
But instead of ending up a
princess, I ended up a prisoner.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.797
And the dream became a nightmare.

23:20.165 --> 23:24.136
Bearing 340 - 2 F-16 fighters
closing at Mach 1.7.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.572
Take it off of auto, Dom.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.243
Combat mode.

23:28.674 --> 23:31.553
Negative function on the
automatic pilot disengage.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.920
The Ground Control must be overriding.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.291
We've been hit.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.730
They nearly stuck the rocket up my tailpipe.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.861
Give me guns. ADF pod.

23:48.727 --> 23:50.434
They won't deploy.

23:57.469 --> 24:00.313
Dom, I can't hold her.
She's lose’n altitude fast.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.819
Airwolf to Ground Control. Mayday, mayday!

24:04.877 --> 24:06.652
We're going down. Mayday!

24:06.712 --> 24:09.215
There's noth’n here, Dom.
I can't even muscle it.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.726
It'll tear her apart.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.194
Mayday, mayday!

24:20.125 --> 24:23.072
I've managed to champ
Ground Control's override.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.404
Missiles Dom, gimme all you've got.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.217
Red flight leader, this is Ground Control.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.384
We're still picking up a homing
signal from the aircraft.

24:42.448 --> 24:43.893
Can you confirm the kill?

24:43.949 --> 24:47.795
Roger. There's a hole in the ground
deep enough, it should be pumping oil.

24:47.853 --> 24:51.300
Hold it. I'm getting… Incoming!

25:06.038 --> 25:09.212
You mean to tell me you
just lost 2 jet fighters?

25:10.442 --> 25:12.046
I suggest, Mr. Kase,

25:12.144 --> 25:14.647
you think of activating your ground forces.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.833
Nice shoot’n, String.

25:24.890 --> 25:27.393
That's one hell of a way to spend $50,000.

25:27.459 --> 25:30.872
And you can double that. Those 2
Stingers you used on those jets.

25:31.764 --> 25:34.745
Not to mention the fact of
fire’n off half of our armament

25:34.800 --> 25:37.781
just to make a great, big
smoke’n hole in the ground.

25:37.870 --> 25:41.317
But I gotta admit, it was
pretty slick. Pretty slick.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.151
Well, thank you.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.613
So how we do’n here?

25:46.879 --> 25:49.621
Well, most of the electricals’ fried

25:49.815 --> 25:51.692
which means the radio's out, of course.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.731
And this engine has a cracked turbo section.

25:54.787 --> 25:58.826
I can probably jury-rig the wiring
to get us back up into the air.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.962
But she'll be limp’n.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.105
I was already on my second Hail Mary.

26:08.167 --> 26:11.046
So I know she was about
ready to give up the ghost.

26:12.871 --> 26:16.409
Hey, if I'm outta line, tell me, will ya?

26:16.608 --> 26:19.179
But what the hell is it between you 2?

26:21.513 --> 26:22.890
We were in love

26:25.717 --> 26:27.128
or at least I was.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.701
She was pregnant with my baby.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.100
Didn't want it.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.279
I guess we were just too young.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.768
Tess?

27:16.135 --> 27:18.945
I thought maybe you'd like
to freshen up a little.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.414
Look.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.415
I'm sorry.

27:28.680 --> 27:29.681
For what?

27:32.251 --> 27:33.628
For doubting you.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.399
For thinking you could ever be like them.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.593
I know you're not.

27:56.875 --> 28:00.755
You know, it just may be that you do not
realize what the stakes are here, Barkley.

28:00.812 --> 28:02.723
We're running out of time, man.

28:03.148 --> 28:06.288
Perhaps Mr. Kase isn't capable
of carrying out his role.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.430
The only thing I fail to do

28:12.624 --> 28:14.831
is to anticipate the abilities of the crew

28:14.893 --> 28:16.895
and the capabilities of Airwolf.

28:17.729 --> 28:19.140
You have another plan.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.405
Now that Airwolf is disabled and down,

28:21.466 --> 28:23.810
it's most vulnerable to a ground attack.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.974
And if this one fails also?

28:26.471 --> 28:28.007
I have a backup plan.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.182
Which is…

28:31.243 --> 28:33.655
An insurance policy against failure.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.824
Code name: “Blue Star.”

28:37.282 --> 28:38.659
“Blue Star?”

28:38.884 --> 28:41.455
“Blue Star,” isn't that lovely?

28:41.587 --> 28:42.998
It's appropriate.

28:46.558 --> 28:50.335
Well, I trust this falls short of us
all committing suicide, Mr. Kase.

28:52.497 --> 28:55.740
I'll see to “Blue Star” personally.

29:08.947 --> 29:12.087
Now we've bypassed the capacitor
and the circuit breaker.

29:12.517 --> 29:14.497
And now we'll go red wire

29:15.087 --> 29:16.327
to red wire.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.291
That's gonna work?

29:18.590 --> 29:21.093
Like putting a penny in a fuse box, baby.

29:21.827 --> 29:23.135
We'll find out.

30:05.103 --> 30:07.276
Dom, we need some help.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.250
On my way, buddy.

30:40.272 --> 30:41.478
What are you do’n?

30:41.540 --> 30:45.147
Look at that radar blip, man.
She's head’n for the main road.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.473
Chew him up and spit him out, Dom.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.484
Well, it looks like this is my lucky day.

32:13.498 --> 32:14.602
What the hell do they want?

32:14.666 --> 32:16.236
They're after me.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.439
Hang on.

34:01.907 --> 34:03.079
Hang on.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.898
Oh. Oh, God.

34:51.956 --> 34:55.234
Oh, no. Oh, please God, no.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.596
Don't let me lose this one, too.

35:19.317 --> 35:20.591
Come on, Tess.

35:21.586 --> 35:24.089
Why the hell didn't you
tell me about this?

35:24.522 --> 35:25.796
You know why.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.803
That was a long time ago.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.967
What's over is over.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.406
Is it, Hawke?

35:37.369 --> 35:38.575
Is it?

35:42.807 --> 35:46.345
Listen, I'll stand by on radio, huh?

35:51.883 --> 35:55.387
Hawke, you never have forgiven me, have you?

35:58.456 --> 36:00.129
I loved you, Tess.

36:02.093 --> 36:03.834
I really wanted our baby.

36:06.598 --> 36:07.872
I know you did.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.604
But we were so young.

36:13.638 --> 36:15.208
I wanted so much.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.883
You want this one though, don't you?

36:23.481 --> 36:24.824
Very much.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.627
What about your husband?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.830
It isn't Cullen's baby.

36:39.864 --> 36:40.968
I told you.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.872
He made a prisoner of me.

36:46.204 --> 36:51.586
He isn't happy unless he can encompass
everything and everybody around him.

36:53.578 --> 36:56.957
You've never been stupid enough
to let anybody do that to you.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.986
Well, I was stupid enough
to have an affair.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.000
Maybe you were just look’n for a way out.

37:07.625 --> 37:08.831
Maybe.

37:11.296 --> 37:12.639
He was a…

37:15.467 --> 37:17.140
a visiting

37:17.869 --> 37:20.076
dignitary from an Arab state.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.411
He was a Prince.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.761
Kind of like your fairytale.

37:36.421 --> 37:39.698
But it only lasted long
enough for him to tell me

37:41.860 --> 37:44.136
that East and West
could never really meet.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.034
But I know one thing.

37:50.435 --> 37:54.008
I want this baby more than I've ever
wanted anything in my whole life.

37:54.672 --> 37:56.777
And this might be my only chance.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.486
What do you mean?

38:00.812 --> 38:02.120
Because I…

38:03.648 --> 38:06.128
chose to terminate our baby,

38:07.819 --> 38:11.767
the doctors told me that I might
never be able to have another one.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.342
Tess, I promise.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.576
I promise you.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.520
You're gonna have this baby.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.563
Hawke, what do you mean
you had a little trouble?

38:47.625 --> 38:49.696
Yeah, I'll explain when I see you.

38:49.761 --> 38:52.605
Meanwhile, we'll be fly’n to the
Committee Hearing on our own.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.873
Roger that. Just get her to the
meeting before anything else goes wrong.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.107
We'll meet you there. Angel One out.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.920
Well Barkley, this has
been very interesting.

39:06.978 --> 39:09.822
But you do realize, of course,
if your plan fails,

39:09.881 --> 39:12.828
the next meeting we'll be
holding, will be in Hell.

39:13.251 --> 39:16.460
I assure you Cullen, it will not fail.

39:25.129 --> 39:30.135
So after their hit squad knocks off
these Heads of State, then what?

39:30.835 --> 39:33.714
The leadership vacuum
will spawn a monetary crisis.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.778
After which they plan to step in

39:35.840 --> 39:38.912
and take control of the
International Banking Committee.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.415
That'll give them regulatory
power over world currency.

39:43.147 --> 39:44.148
Exactly.

41:04.429 --> 41:08.138
The Committee's waiting. I trust
you're ready to testify, Mrs. Dixon.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.437
You're damn right she's ready.

41:57.382 --> 42:00.295
- Hold it. Pick up that gun.
- Hawke!
- Nobody move.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.431
Easy. Easy, boys. Easy.

42:04.789 --> 42:06.268
Easy, easy…

42:10.194 --> 42:11.832
There's your traitor.

42:11.896 --> 42:13.102
What?

42:16.300 --> 42:19.873
Will you please take the
witness stand, Mrs. Dixon?

42:26.077 --> 42:27.681
Raise your right hand.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.856
Now, do you solemnly swear

42:32.984 --> 42:35.897
to tell the truth, the whole truth,

42:36.854 --> 42:39.357
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

42:47.899 --> 42:49.310
Mrs. Dixon?

43:00.278 --> 43:01.689
Mrs. Dixon?

43:06.617 --> 43:08.255
Yes, I do.

43:34.779 --> 43:37.055
How did you know?

43:39.117 --> 43:41.597
Dom uncovered this listening device.

43:42.386 --> 43:45.026
It was tuned into the
same one your girl wore.

43:45.356 --> 43:49.304
You know, I picked it up on radar.
That's how they were able to track us.

43:49.660 --> 43:53.107
So Vivian planted it in the
clothes she gave to Mrs. Dixon.

43:54.198 --> 43:55.734
What about your girl?

43:56.334 --> 43:58.439
Ever find out why she turned over?

43:59.170 --> 44:02.174
Yeah, something new… money.

44:03.508 --> 44:05.647
That and an excuse about her disenchantment

44:05.710 --> 44:08.850
with the way the Firm's
been handling world affairs.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.794
How'd your lady do?

44:12.884 --> 44:14.295
She's still at it.

44:14.785 --> 44:16.287
She'll probably be
testifying until morning.

44:16.354 --> 44:18.561
What about her husband, Cullen Dixon?

44:18.723 --> 44:22.102
The Mexican Federales took
his yacht down for us.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.530
They've got everybody in custody.

44:29.100 --> 44:30.374
Well…

44:31.969 --> 44:34.006
Guess I owe you both on this one.

44:34.338 --> 44:36.147
Yeah, you do.

44:37.175 --> 44:39.382
You take care of Tess, and we'll be even.

44:39.777 --> 44:40.949
I will.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.389
Yeah, you better.

44:42.480 --> 44:46.326
‘Cause she promised to name the
baby Stringfellow if it's a boy

44:46.484 --> 44:49.795
or Dominique if it's a girl.

44:51.489 --> 44:53.127
Poor kid'll never have a chance.

44:56.427 --> 44:58.065
Looks like I'm driving.

44:58.729 --> 45:00.208
Oh, allow me.
