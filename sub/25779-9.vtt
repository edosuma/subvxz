WEBVTT

00:02.290 --> 00:03.496
Rash is gone.

00:04.210 --> 00:07.248
Fur is thicker than ever.

00:07.670 --> 00:11.254
You are one robust feline.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.302
Ready for orders, Captain.

00:22.060 --> 00:23.050
Excellent.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.181
You and Dud need to meet
with my accountant.

00:25.310 --> 00:28.109
-She wants to take your money.
-And I want to give her my money.

00:28.230 --> 00:30.141
She's got the buy-in agreement
for the LLC

00:30.280 --> 00:31.930
that will make offers on the land.

00:32.070 --> 00:33.777
-Four o'clock tomorrow?
-Great.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.028
We're having Band Night
at the Lodge tonight.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.730
If you want to swing by, tonight's--

00:37.870 --> 00:39.486
No, I can't tonight.

00:39.910 --> 00:42.151
Hey, so this girl's office
is in Artesia.

00:42.580 --> 00:44.241
-You got a pen?
-Yeah.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.491
One-one-three...

00:46.630 --> 00:48.701
Pioneer Boulevard, Suite one-oh...

00:48.840 --> 00:51.127
It's the north side of the building.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.217
-Can you say that again?
-I got to go.

01:00.180 --> 01:01.215
-What?
-Hey.

01:01.350 --> 01:02.977
Any word from Captain?

01:03.100 --> 01:06.058
He wants us to see his accountant
tomorrow to sign docs

01:06.190 --> 01:07.976
and make this official.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.851
You're gonna need
to bring your money.

01:10.610 --> 01:12.931
Should we get a lawyer
to look over the prospectus?

01:15.570 --> 01:16.731
Yeah, I'm kidding.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.651
Ernie

01:18.780 --> 01:20.111
It's a joke. It's a...

01:26.960 --> 01:29.839
Maybe things
are finally looking up, Larry.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.887
Your car title loan
was due yesterday.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.437
One day, we'll look back
on these tte--ttes, Burt,

01:52.570 --> 01:53.776
and we're gonna laugh.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.446
Know what laughter sounds like?

01:56.570 --> 01:58.481
Let some gas out of
your rotting insides,

01:58.610 --> 01:59.862
might sound like laughter.

02:00.570 --> 02:03.483
Hey, pretty soon,
none of this is gonna matter, OK?

02:04.330 --> 02:05.536
You're out of time.

02:17.420 --> 02:18.421
Oh, hey.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.753
I'm getting an early start.
Got to drop my kit off at the Lodge.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.806
I know I've been crowding you lately.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.350
I'll give you some space.

02:34.730 --> 02:36.186
I've been an asshole.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.526
Oh, no.

02:37.650 --> 02:40.733
Look, I've got a good feeling
things are gonna get back to normal.

02:52.670 --> 02:53.705
Hi, Paul.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.989
Where's Alice?

02:55.380 --> 02:56.450
Playing hooky.

02:58.510 --> 02:59.671
Do you have a minute?

03:00.130 --> 03:00.961
Yeah.

03:01.090 --> 03:05.004
I said you and Dud
were a bad example,

03:05.140 --> 03:06.380
and I didn't mean that.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.635
I owe you an apology.

03:09.180 --> 03:10.181
Forget it.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.891
I know what Alice is capable of,

03:14.020 --> 03:15.977
and I hate seeing her throw it away.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.316
The surfing thing?

03:18.190 --> 03:20.192
She's just afraid of the real world.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.231
Well, the real world's overrated.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.321
How was your seminar?

03:25.740 --> 03:28.289
It was an executive recruiting thing.

03:28.790 --> 03:30.576
I made it to the final round.

03:31.670 --> 03:32.660
Yeah.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.417
Then you must have impressed them.

03:34.540 --> 03:35.951
I don't know. I guess.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.502
It gets me on a salary track.

03:39.050 --> 03:40.666
I wish your dad could see this.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.636
Yeah, I know.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.290
Took a little too long.

03:44.890 --> 03:45.880
Sorry, Dad.

03:49.060 --> 03:51.597
Some kids don't grow up
until their parents die.

03:52.310 --> 03:53.766
Maybe that's Alice, too.

03:54.690 --> 03:57.569
That's sweet.
It's kind of messed up, but sweet.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.317
Your dad had faith in you.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.856
I don't know if he told you that.

04:05.030 --> 04:06.270
All the time.

04:08.370 --> 04:09.576
Don't screw it up.

04:43.070 --> 04:44.697
In bed or on a mission,

04:44.820 --> 04:47.778
Stone was no good at beginnings,
but he knew how to close.

04:48.530 --> 04:50.578
All he'd been through
the last eight weeks -

04:50.700 --> 04:52.407
the microfiche, the 16 Kills,

04:52.540 --> 04:55.032
and the virus that was now
living inside his body -

04:55.170 --> 04:57.912
was hurtling with him as
he double-clutched around a corner,

04:58.040 --> 05:00.293
and the Vltava River
swung into view.

05:00.710 --> 05:05.625
There, glittering on the far shore
like fool's gold, was Zbraslav...

05:06.550 --> 05:08.678
the place where all this would end.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.636
Hey! You coming?

05:12.890 --> 05:13.880
Let's go.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.571
Last Band Night at the 49.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.372
If they turn this place
into a cell phone store,

05:38.500 --> 05:39.706
I'm gonna burn it down.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.872
-They won't.
-It will just sit here empty.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.331
We'll miss it from time to time,
then stop seeing it.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.619
That's what happens.

05:47.470 --> 05:49.040
Maybe something else will happen.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.841
-Like what?
-Nothing's gonna happen.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.692
The crowd's getting crazy.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.650
This might be our Altamont.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.617
Better than anything I've seen
at Lodge 1.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.071
They just want one last look
before it's all gone.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.416
This is a wake.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.411
What's it like in London?

06:22.880 --> 06:26.123
Dreary, musty, gray.

06:26.590 --> 06:27.921
But all that history?

06:28.050 --> 06:29.336
Yeah, but that's just it.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.381
It weighs down on you.

06:31.510 --> 06:33.888
I suppose our tavern
is not that different to this,

06:34.010 --> 06:37.059
but it just feels... heavier.

06:37.180 --> 06:38.932
Nothing lively about it.

06:39.060 --> 06:41.051
Everything muffled.

06:41.730 --> 06:43.391
I bet you can hear yourself think.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.646
I know.

06:44.780 --> 06:45.895
It's terrible.

06:48.740 --> 06:49.901
You know,

06:50.030 --> 06:54.069
all I've ever wanted to do is walk
in Harwood Fritz Merrill's footsteps

06:54.200 --> 06:56.328
in the building he designed himself.

06:56.870 --> 07:01.569
But now I see that
that would just be tedious and dull.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.123
You're like a wizard
of demystification.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.250
Thank you.

07:21.230 --> 07:22.265
Hey.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.859
So, he wants you to be with her?

07:25.980 --> 07:27.311
That's what he said.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.891
-That's kind of weird, right?
-Yes!

07:31.030 --> 07:33.738
It's weird! Scott's a weird dude.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.770
I think he thinks
he's doing it for Connie,

07:35.910 --> 07:39.949
but he's also doing it for him,
because now he knows I know he knows.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.117
-It's a power trip.
-Right.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.661
Right! Yes!

07:44.380 --> 07:47.498
You know what you should do?
You should tell her.

07:48.550 --> 07:53.670
Yes, because then you'll know
that she knows he knows.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.541
-Stop.
-What do you mean?

07:55.680 --> 07:58.638
You're living the dream.
You're living in a soap opera.

08:01.940 --> 08:02.930
Listen.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.973
You got to stop saying things like,
"It all could work out."

08:06.480 --> 08:08.312
Until Captain's a done deal,

08:08.440 --> 08:10.147
I don't want to jinx it.

08:12.030 --> 08:14.158
Well, you just jinxed it
by saying that.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.947
But I just unjinxed it
by saying this, so--

08:17.080 --> 08:18.366
Just shut up about it.

08:35.429 --> 08:36.419
Hey!

08:37.100 --> 08:38.090
Hey.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.052
The library, right?
You used to check me out.

08:44.350 --> 08:45.340
Or not...

08:45.480 --> 08:47.801
You checked my books out at the...

08:49.020 --> 08:50.897
sorry.
You work at the library, right?

08:51.030 --> 08:53.442
Yes. I remember you. I remember you.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.941
Well, what are you doing here?

08:57.070 --> 09:00.449
Oh, my dad works - worked -
at Orbis with Gil Sandoval.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.030
Yeah, I know Gil.

09:02.620 --> 09:04.531
I'm a squire. He's the astronomer.

09:05.870 --> 09:06.871
-Rig ht.

09:07.710 --> 09:10.293
I've driven by a zillion times
but never been inside.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.548
Well, do you want me
to give you a tour?

09:12.670 --> 09:14.297
I can give you a tour if you...?

09:16.220 --> 09:17.210
Thank you.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.058
My friend went
to go get us some beers.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.591
He's coming back.

09:24.140 --> 09:25.130
OK. Well...

09:26.190 --> 09:27.430
Enjoy the Lodge.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.299
On behalf of all of us.

09:30.520 --> 09:31.772
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

09:32.230 --> 09:33.231
OK.

09:36.610 --> 09:37.441
Thanks.

09:47.580 --> 09:49.287
You know, it's possible

09:49.420 --> 09:52.333
you've already walked
in Merrill's footsteps.

09:56.550 --> 10:00.919
Aren't there stories of him
traveling to North America

10:01.050 --> 10:02.552
during his lost decade?

10:03.930 --> 10:05.807
Maybe he came to California.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.853
Well, in the '20s, a German scholar

10:10.980 --> 10:12.937
actually wrote
a monograph about that.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.778
He also suggested
that Merrill was traveling around

10:16.900 --> 10:20.120
in order to elude
a "one-eyed man" from Cairo

10:20.240 --> 10:21.822
he claimed was following him.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.241
Well...

10:26.120 --> 10:28.578
Lynx scholarship is dodgy at best.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.376
But you believe.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.542
Maybe some of it's true.

10:36.590 --> 10:38.080
You think I'm a crackpot.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.290
Look, I know I'm the heathen priest -

10:42.430 --> 10:44.057
you know, a nonbeliever.

10:45.100 --> 10:47.728
Whether I believe
every story about Merrill...

10:49.520 --> 10:50.646
all of this...

10:52.060 --> 10:54.188
the Lodge and the people

10:54.320 --> 10:55.640
and the music...

10:57.530 --> 10:59.601
it is very real.

11:00.860 --> 11:05.616
And I'm glad that I got
to come to Long Beach and...

11:07.540 --> 11:08.905
be reminded of that.

11:20.630 --> 11:22.962
Last couple of weeks
have been hard on everybody.

11:25.640 --> 11:26.960
I know it's not your fault.

12:03.430 --> 12:04.545
Can we talk?

12:38.380 --> 12:39.370
No.

12:39.880 --> 12:40.870
No.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.379
Hey.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.635
Lodge guy.

12:52.770 --> 12:54.090
-Yeah.
-I love it.

12:54.520 --> 12:55.646
Luminous Knight.

12:55.770 --> 12:57.147
This stuff is hilarious.

12:57.980 --> 12:59.357
You got a men's room?

12:59.480 --> 13:01.107
Yeah, just right around the corner.

13:01.610 --> 13:02.429
All right.

13:02.570 --> 13:03.890
-Don't get lost.
-Yep.

13:07.700 --> 13:08.940
Where's your picture?

13:10.200 --> 13:13.079
I haven't earned the right yet
to have my picture on that wall.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.490
Well, you'd better hurry up.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.913
Hey, so, we've got a library.

13:22.050 --> 13:24.417
And you being a librarian,

13:24.550 --> 13:26.541
I thought that maybe
you'd want to see it.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.842
We're not meant to bring
nonmembers up there,

13:28.970 --> 13:30.631
but maybe I could make an exception.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.510
Yeah?

13:33.230 --> 13:34.425
-Let's go.
-OK.

13:35.140 --> 13:36.892
We can wait for your friend
if you want.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.770
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:42.900 --> 13:47.315
So everything's pretty much the exact
same since... you know, 60 years ago.

13:47.450 --> 13:49.020
Except the mummy's gone, of course.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.231
I heard something about that
in the news.

13:51.370 --> 13:52.781
Oh, yeah? I found it.

13:52.910 --> 13:54.446
I mean, not by myself,

13:54.580 --> 13:57.117
but I came through the wall first...

13:57.790 --> 14:00.168
and then a bunch
of other stuff happened.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.122
Then I actually fell on top of it,

14:02.250 --> 14:04.912
and I breathed in
some of its brain dust.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.172
Not everyone can say
they've done that.

14:08.890 --> 14:09.880
Yeah.

14:10.220 --> 14:13.884
Yeah, sometimes
I just come up here... and I think.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.091
I'm looking at all the same stuff

14:18.230 --> 14:20.722
that he was looking at
when he died, when he...

14:21.690 --> 14:24.352
set off on his journey
of immortality.

14:25.190 --> 14:28.899
You ever... stare at yourself
in the mirror so long--

14:29.030 --> 14:31.192
That your face starts to fall off?

14:31.320 --> 14:34.403
Like saying a word over and over
and it stops meaning anything.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.076
Because it's not real.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.033
It's, like, a symbol for what's real,

14:39.170 --> 14:41.411
but the real thing is hidden...

14:43.000 --> 14:44.240
beneath the surface.

14:45.090 --> 14:46.330
Like a carrot.

14:47.670 --> 14:49.081
Exactly like a carrot.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.210
Emily, are you up there?

14:53.890 --> 14:56.052
Thank you for the tour.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.431
Anytime.

15:14.450 --> 15:15.440
Hey.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.570
Having fun?

15:21.670 --> 15:22.956
This is weird, Scott.

15:23.630 --> 15:28.124
Well, haven't you noticed, Fontaine?
Everything is weird all the time.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.921
Besides, this...

15:33.180 --> 15:34.670
This isn't about you and me.

15:35.350 --> 15:36.556
It sort of is.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.591
-Look, I got to go.
-No. Wait a second.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.936
I'm gonna be at work...

15:41.980 --> 15:43.186
all day tomorrow.

15:44.730 --> 15:45.936
Now, you understand?

15:47.610 --> 15:49.317
This is for Connie.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.630
Hold on.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.681
Everyone?

16:22.390 --> 16:23.892
Hey, everybody. OK.

16:24.020 --> 16:25.101
Yeah, everyone.

16:26.230 --> 16:29.313
Hey, just look around you right now.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.272
Look at what's happening.

16:31.780 --> 16:33.691
I mean, this place...

16:34.320 --> 16:38.154
I'm telling you, this place
could be like this... every night.

16:38.620 --> 16:42.534
You know,
Lodge 49 is supposed to go away.

16:47.750 --> 16:48.876
But it can't.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.962
But it can't,
because there are things...

16:53.630 --> 16:56.429
there are bigger things...

16:57.470 --> 16:59.131
at work right now.

16:59.260 --> 17:01.922
Things... Things that are bubbling.

17:02.430 --> 17:06.219
And I mean bubbling
under the ground as we speak.

17:06.349 --> 17:10.969
And I know that it sounds a lot like
I'm talking about oil, but I'm not.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.810
I'm talking about the spirit

17:14.950 --> 17:18.318
that binds this room
and everybody in it together!

17:26.880 --> 17:29.087
Lodge 49 isn't going anywhere.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.547
) -No!
No, no, no.

17:32.420 --> 17:36.459
It can never go away

17:36.590 --> 17:40.424
because we are the heart
of the beast!

17:40.850 --> 17:42.011
And we can never--

17:56.320 --> 17:57.606
Yeah!

17:59.280 --> 18:02.409
Why do we want impossible things?

18:02.950 --> 18:04.406
We're not impossible.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.322
It's like we dug a tunnel
back to high school.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.951
It runs right under our real lives.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.291
We're mole rats, baby.

18:20.890 --> 18:22.096
And here's the thing.

18:23.180 --> 18:24.170
Scott...

18:25.430 --> 18:26.761
he knows about us.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.339
What?

18:29.900 --> 18:31.766
I thought he was gonna take
a swing at me,

18:31.900 --> 18:34.608
but he told me that he thought
it was all a good thing...

18:35.360 --> 18:37.146
as long as it made you happy.

18:38.110 --> 18:41.023
And he didn't want me to tell you
that he told me that he knows.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.901
It's supposed to be our secret,

18:43.030 --> 18:45.249
like it's me and him
having the affair.

18:45.370 --> 18:46.440
Oh, my God.

18:47.960 --> 18:48.950
I know.

18:49.370 --> 18:51.168
It sounds kind of hard to believe.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.756
It isn't, actually.

18:58.050 --> 18:59.085
It's Scott.

18:59.970 --> 19:01.711
Did he say how long he's known?

19:01.850 --> 19:04.387
No.
But I think it's been for a while.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.888
We've been doing
this running around for nothing.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.057
This is a nightmare. I feel ill.

19:09.190 --> 19:12.308
It's because we've been living
in @ moral gray area,

19:12.440 --> 19:13.976
but we're almost out of it.

19:14.110 --> 19:15.680
We don't have to hide anymore.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.606
Everything is coming together.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.770
Where are you going?

19:22.530 --> 19:23.520
I don't know.

19:25.490 --> 19:26.480
I can't...

19:27.620 --> 19:28.610
go home.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.609
-I can't stay here.
-You can.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.583
-We got the room for the whole day.
-That's not what I mean.

19:35.170 --> 19:36.160
Jesus.

19:40.130 --> 19:41.120
Ernie...

19:44.510 --> 19:46.000
Do you understand what I've done?

19:47.100 --> 19:48.170
What we've done?

19:51.310 --> 19:52.300
I know.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.390
Connie...

19:56.770 --> 19:59.740
Please, just stay for a little while.

20:04.700 --> 20:05.690
Can't.

20:07.950 --> 20:09.156
I just need to think.

20:30.890 --> 20:32.301
Give me your eyes.

20:33.020 --> 20:34.010
Tonight...

20:35.560 --> 20:37.437
is all about the human side

20:37.570 --> 20:40.528
of Omni Capital Partners
Food Service West.

20:40.900 --> 20:43.813
Now, I see some of you looking
around, anxiously wondering,

20:43.950 --> 20:48.160
"Where is Janet Price, our CEO?"

20:50.370 --> 20:51.360
Don't worry.

20:51.910 --> 20:55.494
Janet is here on the boat.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.917
But she will only appear

20:58.040 --> 21:00.623
to those who can see her.

21:01.340 --> 21:03.627
Plus, later on,
she's gonna host the raffle,

21:03.760 --> 21:05.831
so be prepared.

21:07.010 --> 21:08.136
Janet told me...

21:09.260 --> 21:13.470
that she's gonna reach right into
your tinderboxes and feel around.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.223
You can decide for yourself
what that means, OK?

21:18.060 --> 21:20.392
You are the Essence.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.691
And you have made it here.

21:28.070 --> 21:29.276
So let's mingle.

21:35.370 --> 21:36.610
You must be thrilled,

21:36.750 --> 21:39.162
taking a cruise
around your own harbor.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.122
Yeah, I've actually never done this.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.455
I got seasick last year,

21:43.590 --> 21:45.968
so I apologize in advance
if I puke all over you.

21:46.090 --> 21:49.003
-That's sweet. Thanks.
-Another round?

21:50.140 --> 21:52.598
This lady was waiting tables
a week ago.

21:52.970 --> 21:54.301
Now she's at the Mingle.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.590
Gives you hope, right?

21:57.060 --> 21:58.095
Absolutely.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.350
Sorry.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.312
So, what's the plan?

22:03.780 --> 22:04.986
Weed out the drunks?

22:05.400 --> 22:07.198
-There are ngKmore cuts...

22:07.320 --> 22:10.028
...unless Janet figures out
how much she's overpaying me

22:10.160 --> 22:11.150
and then I get cut.

22:11.700 --> 22:13.998
When do you think Janet
will magically appear?

22:14.120 --> 22:15.531
You mean, you can't see her?

22:17.420 --> 22:19.821
What, is she hiding
in the Omni suit or something?

22:21.460 --> 22:22.621
Oh, my God!

22:23.460 --> 22:24.450
Look at her.

22:24.590 --> 22:26.547
Can you imagine
that type of commitment?

22:32.560 --> 22:35.097
Hey, Gary,
we're at your accountant's office.

22:35.220 --> 22:38.190
I'm not sure if we have
the right address. Call us back.

22:38.850 --> 22:41.148
Gary must save a lot of money
with this accountant.

22:41.270 --> 22:42.601
The red door was ajar.

22:43.150 --> 22:44.970
"Red like blood," he thought,

22:45.110 --> 22:46.851
"or a matador's cape.”

22:48.360 --> 22:50.237
"That's what I am," thought Stone.

22:50.700 --> 22:54.113
"Hiding in plain sight,
like blood on a matador's cape.”

22:54.830 --> 22:56.070
No! Don't turn it off!

22:56.200 --> 22:57.406
You're hooked now.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.496
Metz is the master.

22:59.620 --> 23:01.122
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

23:02.750 --> 23:03.876
Still no answer.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.335
I don't like this.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.883
Well, Captain's going through some
emotional stuff right now, you know?

23:12.300 --> 23:14.211
Maybe he just told us the wrong time.

23:14.510 --> 23:18.674
It feels like what happened to Stone
in Luxembourg.

23:19.850 --> 23:20.840
Luxembourg?

23:21.230 --> 23:24.393
He got set up, fell into a trap.

23:26.570 --> 23:28.811
What, you think
Captain's setting us up

23:28.950 --> 23:31.021
So someone can steal
our cockfighting money?

23:31.160 --> 23:33.151
No. But think about it.

23:34.490 --> 23:38.996
How many people know
what we know about the oil?

23:40.870 --> 23:43.953
You, me, Gary...

23:44.840 --> 23:47.707
and the guys Gary works for.

23:51.510 --> 23:52.966
-This is bad.
-Yeah.

23:53.720 --> 23:57.634
What if those guys found out about
Gary's plan to screw them over?

23:58.100 --> 24:00.842
What if they got to him -
that's why he's not answering?

24:02.770 --> 24:04.352
Or maybe we're just being paranoid.

24:05.480 --> 24:06.470
You know?

24:07.940 --> 24:08.930
Listen.

24:11.070 --> 24:12.151
What is that?

24:15.950 --> 24:16.940
What?

24:20.080 --> 24:22.071
-A drone?
-That's a drone. That's a drone.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.416
That's a drone.

24:23.790 --> 24:25.531
-What do we do?
-Look to your right.

24:27.210 --> 24:28.666
-Is that an Uber?
-I don't know.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.949
What does he want?

24:30.090 --> 24:31.160
-Let's calm down.
-OK.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.086
Let's see what he wants.
How did he know?

24:33.220 --> 24:34.961
The best defense is offense.
Go at him.

24:35.090 --> 24:36.091
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:36.220 --> 24:37.210
-OK.
-OK.

24:44.940 --> 24:47.181
-What are you looking at?
-I don't know.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.390
What am I looking at?

24:51.320 --> 24:53.903
You got any gift baskets for us...

24:54.740 --> 24:55.559
asshole?

24:55.700 --> 24:57.361
-What?
-Let's go.

24:57.490 --> 24:59.197
-What?
-Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

24:59.330 --> 25:00.570
-Who are they?
-Let's go.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.111
-They're everywhere!
-Go!

25:02.620 --> 25:04.452
OK, we're getting surrounded.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.321
OK, let's go! Let's move!

25:48.250 --> 25:51.049
This is a good place to lay low
until we figure out our next move.

25:51.170 --> 25:52.160
OK.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.466
How do you know about this place?

25:56.010 --> 25:57.125
I love hotels.

26:18.570 --> 26:20.117
It's an honor to finally meet you.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.447
Oh, it is a big honor for you.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.820
Yes, you're very lucky.

26:27.830 --> 26:30.242
I broke tape on your viv.
Your rigging was tight.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.451
You caught the wind
and crossed the equator.

26:33.050 --> 26:36.293
I was just kind of talking
out of my ass, but...

26:36.420 --> 26:37.251
Exactly.

26:37.380 --> 26:40.008
Intuition is the whore child
of Truth and Joy.

26:40.140 --> 26:40.959
Blammo!

26:42.140 --> 26:43.756
-Blammo.
-It's a thing in my book.

26:43.890 --> 26:45.927
They're useful tips
in little shaded boxes.

26:46.060 --> 26:48.051
"Photosynthabliss.”" Blammo!

26:48.190 --> 26:49.009
Blammo.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.266
I also want to say
I'm really happy for you two.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.470
What?

26:52.980 --> 26:56.109
I sort of disclosed our...
relationship.

26:56.530 --> 26:58.771
It's cool. _
I encourage Eros eruptions.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.402
How many companies can say that?

27:00.530 --> 27:03.488
As long as you file your paperwork
with HR, I say go for it.

27:03.910 --> 27:05.321
No, I just...

27:05.910 --> 27:09.119
I'm not sure
he disclosed it to me yet.

27:09.250 --> 27:10.490
Well, is it a good thing?

27:10.620 --> 27:12.531
Well, he hasn't puked on me today,

27:12.670 --> 27:13.876
so, yeah.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.582
Yeah, it's a good thing.

27:15.710 --> 27:18.088
Tell me, Liz, where do you
see yourself in five years?

27:20.010 --> 27:21.045
Five years.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.419
I don't know.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.346
Think about it.
Answer before we dock.

27:29.810 --> 27:30.629
OK.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.107
After the Navy,

27:38.240 --> 27:40.698
I was with someone for a long time.

27:41.450 --> 27:42.565
She was great.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.446
We lived together.

27:45.580 --> 27:48.038
And it felt real and grown-up.

27:48.790 --> 27:51.748
And we didn't have to hide anything
from anyone.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.162
But... that ended.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.291
Was it... ugly?

27:59.720 --> 28:01.006
It was a sucker punch.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.177
We didn't see it coming.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.257
I was alone for a long time,

28:06.390 --> 28:09.519
dating here and there,
but nothing that felt... real.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.519
And just as I was getting used
to the idea of being alone...

28:13.350 --> 28:14.806
Connie came back.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.851
Maybe it was a good thing
she was with Scott.

28:17.980 --> 28:19.232
Maybe that's why it...

28:20.530 --> 28:21.520
worked.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.657
I guess we'll see.

28:25.490 --> 28:26.776
Are you in love with her?

28:28.870 --> 28:30.577
Yes, I am, but...

28:31.120 --> 28:32.576
I don't know if that's enough.

28:37.550 --> 28:38.790
You ever been in love?

28:43.010 --> 28:44.330
No one's ever asked me that.

28:46.510 --> 28:47.966
I never asked myself that.

28:49.010 --> 28:50.717
I felt something with Gloria.

28:51.310 --> 28:53.051
Yeah, I was in love with her,

28:53.190 --> 28:55.227
but it was like this big bang.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.471
You know, I knew it couldn't last.

28:59.570 --> 29:01.060
Yeah. And then last night...

29:04.030 --> 29:06.112
I don't know. I don't know.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.902
How was it for you

29:10.740 --> 29:11.741
Well...

29:12.460 --> 29:14.076
in my experience...

29:14.750 --> 29:17.913
_ it comes on
like an orchestra warming up...

29:18.630 --> 29:21.759
and then the music is just playing.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.545
I like that.

29:29.510 --> 29:31.342
You think
that we're really in danger?

29:32.520 --> 29:33.510
I don't know.

29:34.270 --> 29:36.147
I'm so turned around right now.

29:41.690 --> 29:42.680
Gary.

29:42.820 --> 29:43.810
What

29:43.940 --> 29:46.272
Where are you?
My accountant said you never showed.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.811
We were at the shopping center.
I called you a bunch.

29:48.950 --> 29:50.486
Shopping center? Where...

29:50.950 --> 29:54.363
Look, my phone was off.
I had to do a little soul-searching.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.169
I tried to look at my life
with fresh eyes, like the Lynx, so...

29:58.960 --> 30:01.497
I decided to sign the divorce papers.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.917
Come by the house.
The paperwork's all set.

30:05.050 --> 30:08.259
Brenda's out tagging sea lions
at Anacapa all day, so see you in 307?

30:08.390 --> 30:10.176
-Yeah, OK. We'll be there.
-All right.

30:29.990 --> 30:32.197
Connie! Ernie!
I know you're in there!

30:32.910 --> 30:34.867
You promised
you wouldn't tell her, Ernie!

30:35.000 --> 30:36.741
You lied, you selfish bastard!

30:36.870 --> 30:38.326
Now you've ruined everything!

30:38.750 --> 30:39.990
Connie's not here!

30:40.130 --> 30:42.337
You've got no honor, man! None!

30:42.460 --> 30:44.167
But I do, Ernie,

30:44.300 --> 30:45.961
because I'm a good guy.

30:46.090 --> 30:47.717
A good guy!

30:53.510 --> 30:54.511
Connie?

30:56.140 --> 30:57.130
Listen to me.

30:58.350 --> 30:59.511
I'm sorry.

31:00.350 --> 31:01.602
I was just trying to...

31:03.480 --> 31:06.814
Come on, let's talk. I mean,
maybe we can all work something out.

31:06.940 --> 31:07.941
Hey, Scott.

31:09.740 --> 31:11.026
Connie's not here.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.366
I can vouch for that.

31:14.490 --> 31:15.480
Dud?

31:16.290 --> 31:17.860
What the hell is going on in there?

31:18.540 --> 31:19.996
-Ernie.
-Open the door.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.537
-Hey! Open the goddamn door!
-Ernie. Ernie?

31:25.300 --> 31:27.200
Open the door!

31:34.350 --> 31:36.808
God! Did you tell him where I was?

31:44.610 --> 31:46.931
-Holy shit! I know this guy!
-What?

31:47.070 --> 31:48.731
-He's the geologist!
-Got to move!

31:48.860 --> 31:50.146
-Hey!
-No, we got to move!

31:50.280 --> 31:51.987
-Hang on!
-Don't go anywhere.

31:53.410 --> 31:54.400
Hey!

32:01.670 --> 32:04.128
I was teaching Rocks for Jocks
out at Long Beach State,

32:04.250 --> 32:08.289
but I got greedy and took on
this groundwater class out at Pomona.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.423
Like, three kids registered,
and it was a really long drive,

32:12.550 --> 32:14.712
so I didn't think twice
about not showing up...

32:15.300 --> 32:17.632
until the dickhead section leader
ratted me out.

32:18.430 --> 32:19.886
I lost both jobs

32:20.020 --> 32:22.432
and my crustal-deformation seminar.

32:23.190 --> 32:26.069
Then my apartment,
then my girlfriend.

32:26.650 --> 32:27.640
It was Jenga, man.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.771
Just tell us about
the Kaplan Architects!

32:29.900 --> 32:32.062
Oh, right. Kaplan.

32:32.860 --> 32:34.237
So you knew it was all a scam?

32:34.370 --> 32:36.737
Oh, about half the people
in that room were in on it.

32:36.870 --> 32:40.443
They paid me to falsify my report
and to say the land wasn't toxic,

32:40.580 --> 32:43.163
and then to improv it
up in front of the City Council.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.412
I did my best to get the whole affair
out of my mind.

32:47.540 --> 32:50.419
Did the guys you worked for
tell you anything about their plan?

32:50.550 --> 32:52.791
No, just told me what to say
and where to sign.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.387
Didn't say anything about the land?

32:55.510 --> 32:56.796
That land is dead.

32:57.220 --> 32:58.631
They sucked all the oil out,

32:58.760 --> 33:00.922
then the war machine rolled in
and took a dump,

33:01.060 --> 33:03.631
and then the refineries pissed
into the watershed.

33:04.060 --> 33:05.437
It's got nothing left to give.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.551
No, but it does,

33:07.690 --> 33:11.809
because you can go deeper
with the drilling underneath the...

33:11.940 --> 33:13.851
Right? With the technology and the...

33:13.990 --> 33:15.105
-Right.
-You can go...

33:15.240 --> 33:17.481
sorry, guys.
There's definitely no ail.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.032
We should stay in touch.
And thanks for the ride.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.446
I probably won't sue you.

33:25.620 --> 33:27.031
Son of a bitch!

33:40.510 --> 33:41.807
There's no escape.

33:44.980 --> 33:46.300
I get cluster headaches.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.567
"Where do I see myself
in five years?"

33:53.690 --> 33:55.567
Don't. That was for them.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.522
I have to spend a lot of time
with my dial turned up to 11.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.651
What's this, like, a six?

34:02.910 --> 34:05.322
I like you. You're like a young me.

34:07.290 --> 34:09.621
-I'm older than you.
-Well, you know what I mean.

34:12.170 --> 34:14.502
I didn't have a lot of help
navigating the way up.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.426
I'd like to help you.

34:17.219 --> 34:19.678
It would have been so much better
not to do it all alone.

34:20.760 --> 34:21.750
Thanks.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.341
I don't really feel like
I've earned it.

34:27.060 --> 34:30.473
When you asked me about
five years from now...

34:33.190 --> 34:36.023
I couldn't even see myself, so...

34:36.989 --> 34:38.900
I can't even see myself tomorrow.

34:39.030 --> 34:42.159
I just run as fast as I can
and hope it doesn't all fall apart.

34:44.370 --> 34:45.360
Blammo.

34:46.750 --> 34:47.864
It's all noise.

34:48.370 --> 34:51.032
There are real, high-level things
happening that matter.

34:51.170 --> 34:54.083
You're a natural leader. You could
be a part of that if you want it.

34:54.590 --> 34:55.705
Do you want it?

34:58.300 --> 34:59.290
Yes.

35:01.090 --> 35:02.751
Yeah, I want it.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.472
You have what it takes
to go really far.

35:08.020 --> 35:09.010
Janet!

35:09.900 --> 35:10.890
The raffle.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.707
Gary had better have an explanation.

35:42.260 --> 35:43.250
You ready?

35:45.060 --> 35:47.301
I saw what I wanted to see...

35:48.810 --> 35:49.880
the whole time.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.317
He always had a smile on his face.

35:59.900 --> 36:00.890
Captain?

36:01.780 --> 36:02.770
My dad.

36:30.430 --> 36:31.431
Gary?

36:37.150 --> 36:39.027
-Oh, thank God!
-What happened?

36:39.150 --> 36:42.108
Some lunatic knocked me out
and I woke up tied to this chair.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.651
Look at this mess!

36:43.780 --> 36:44.770
Untie me.

36:44.910 --> 36:47.026
No, don't untie him. Don't untie him.

36:47.160 --> 36:50.073
-Don't point that harpoon at me!
-Well, where is this lunatic?

36:50.200 --> 36:52.862
Dud, what are you doing?
He could still be here in the house.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.286
-Untie me.
-Who is he?

36:55.420 --> 36:57.832
It was probably
the gift-basket mafia.

36:57.960 --> 37:00.008
They found out my plan
and sent a guy.

37:00.130 --> 37:02.212
Your plan? Your plan was bullshit!

37:02.340 --> 37:03.796
There's no oil, Gary.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.750
We looked into it. You lied to us.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.552
-Who told you that?
-Ernie ran over the geologist.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.513
It doesn't matter.
Just tell us why you lied to us.

37:11.640 --> 37:12.846
Ernie, I swear to God,

37:12.980 --> 37:14.436
I'm not lying.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.052
They're going after the oil.
I saw the equipment.

37:17.190 --> 37:19.978
Come on, guys. I got everything
riding on this. Everything!

37:20.110 --> 37:23.273
Why would they drill on toxic land

37:23.400 --> 37:24.777
if there's no oil?

37:25.320 --> 37:26.776
Why? He's back.

37:29.410 --> 37:30.946
-Avery?
-Drop the harpoon!

37:31.950 --> 37:34.783
-OK. All right, all right.
-I thought you guys might show up.

37:35.540 --> 37:36.666
You know this guy?

37:36.790 --> 37:38.701
He's a Lynx, or claims to be.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.456
He tried to rob the Lodge.

37:40.590 --> 37:41.660
You brought food.

37:41.800 --> 37:42.870
Why did you bring food?

37:43.010 --> 37:45.331
I misjudged his bodyweight
with the chloroform.

37:45.840 --> 37:46.966
I had some time.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.098
I've been watching you for weeks.

37:50.470 --> 37:52.052
The trip to the desert,

37:52.180 --> 37:54.638
the rendezvous today
with the smoking man.

37:54.770 --> 37:56.556
Putting your ducks in a row,
no doubt,

37:56.690 --> 37:58.351
to claim my prize.

37:59.150 --> 38:00.220
The smoking man?

38:00.770 --> 38:02.067
The Uber dude.

38:02.690 --> 38:03.987
That was his drone.

38:04.110 --> 38:06.693
Oh, what the hell is going on?

38:06.820 --> 38:09.778
Nice try. You're the financier, yes?

38:09.910 --> 38:13.153
You're backing the expedition
to Mexico to find the scrolls.

38:13.290 --> 38:16.112
Were you working with Larry Loomis
before he died,

38:16.250 --> 38:17.706
or are you new to this cabal?

38:17.830 --> 38:19.241
I'm a general contractor.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.870
Hey, you're after the scrolls?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.911
You want to complete the Magnum Opus.

38:24.210 --> 38:27.214
The Magnum Opus is a fairy tale.

38:28.140 --> 38:32.099
And the scrolls have a far more
practical value for me

38:32.220 --> 38:33.676
and the people I represent.

38:33.810 --> 38:35.380
-Take a seat, fellas!
-OK.

38:35.520 --> 38:36.510
Back to back.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.551
-Sit down!
-OK. All right. I got it.

38:41.980 --> 38:43.277
All right, boys.

38:43.610 --> 38:45.271
Surveillance time is over.

38:45.860 --> 38:47.942
The interrogation begins.

38:51.030 --> 38:52.771
Do you always roll
with that much cash?

38:53.830 --> 38:54.820
No, man.

38:54.950 --> 38:56.827
This is my investment capital, man.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.576
Oh, that's good. Yeah. Toss it here.

38:58.710 --> 38:59.575
No.

38:59.710 --> 39:01.030
Dud. Dud, let it go.

39:01.750 --> 39:03.798
You don't need the money.
That's not you.

39:04.250 --> 39:06.002
You got duende. You don't need money.

39:06.130 --> 39:09.213
-I'll take the money.
-No, because then you'll be like me.

39:09.970 --> 39:11.631
All the pancakes.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.097
It's a guffle.

39:13.510 --> 39:14.716
Pancakes and...

39:16.270 --> 39:17.305
birds.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.687
We can only hope half the sea...

39:20.400 --> 39:22.266
Oh, no. The cap's off.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.330
Oh, my God!

40:33.390 --> 40:34.380
Gary.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.227
That's far enough, errand boy.

40:43.350 --> 40:44.340
Back up!

40:44.480 --> 40:45.641
Wait! Wait!

40:48.320 --> 40:50.436
Hey, Dud, good news.

40:51.070 --> 40:52.310
I got my duende back.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.157
Gary, don't do anything stupid!

40:54.530 --> 40:55.486
No!

41:00.200 --> 41:01.611
He nicked my ear!

41:04.880 --> 41:05.870
Gary

41:07.170 --> 41:07.989
Gary?

41:18.140 --> 41:19.596
No! No, no, no!

41:24.270 --> 41:25.556
Help me.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.026
How can he still be alive?

41:39.620 --> 41:41.998
They had to leave
the goddamn horn in.

41:43.370 --> 41:44.360
Yeah.

41:45.330 --> 41:46.320
Well...

41:46.710 --> 41:48.280
It was nice of Brenda to come.

42:48.560 --> 42:49.550
Well...

42:50.650 --> 42:51.640
that's it.

42:52.770 --> 42:53.771
It's over.

42:55.530 --> 42:56.736
You see what happens?

42:57.070 --> 42:59.198
You reach for the stars...

43:00.030 --> 43:04.240
and then you watch a dude
get piked by a narwhal.

43:08.040 --> 43:09.997
I always thought it was nar-whale.
