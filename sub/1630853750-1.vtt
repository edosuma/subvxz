WEBVTT

00:11.094 --> 00:12.637
I like the name Katherine.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.098
-Well, that's pretty.
-Yeah.

00:16.766 --> 00:17.726
Or Indiana.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.645
-For a girl.
-Or a boy.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.858
-Hmm.
-Or we can name him after you.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.444
-Jack Junior?
-Mm-hm.

00:27.527 --> 00:28.945
Maybe JJ for short.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.905
-I like that.
-Hmm.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.283
We also have to consider Mark.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.618
As a name.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.662
If that's what he wants.

00:47.380 --> 00:51.342
-What's Mark doing here?
-Well, the baby might be his, remember?

00:54.596 --> 00:55.472
Hey, Jack.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.016
-Hey, sweetheart.
-Hey.

01:39.057 --> 01:45.355
Uh, so, like I said in my e-mail,
our situation is unique.

01:46.147 --> 01:52.862
About five weeks ago, I had two embryos
implanted via natural cycle FET in L.A.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.114
Okay.

01:54.197 --> 01:58.618
I've had fertility issues, so I didn't
even know if I could get pregnant.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.787
Uh, we had broken up.

02:01.746 --> 02:06.000
But then, we got back together, and, um...

02:06.543 --> 02:08.211
So, the embryos...?

02:08.294 --> 02:11.089
They're mine and my, um...

02:11.172 --> 02:12.090
Her husband's.

02:13.424 --> 02:14.509
My husband's.

02:14.592 --> 02:15.718
Who's not you.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.387
Correct.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.473
Is your husband aware
that paternity is in question?

02:20.557 --> 02:23.351
No. He died a little over a year ago.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.228
Oh.

02:25.311 --> 02:29.023
Yeah. We like to keep things
as complicated as humanly possible.

02:30.024 --> 02:34.779
We can resolve this using a non-invasive
paternity test, also referred to as NIP.

02:34.863 --> 02:38.241
Right. Yeah. What do you think?

02:40.577 --> 02:44.873
Well, I'd like to just focus on you,
you having a healthy baby.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.749
That's all that matters to me.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.336
Mom and baby's well-being
is the number one priority.

02:50.420 --> 02:55.216
-As a specialist in high-risk pregnancy--
-High risk? As in...?

02:55.300 --> 02:59.179
Higher complications
before, during, or after birth.

02:59.262 --> 03:03.433
Given Mel's history with infertility
and her intrapartum death,

03:03.516 --> 03:08.188
she'll need additional screening,
advanced testing, extensive monitoring...

03:21.868 --> 03:26.247
Wow, you barely touched
that incredible breakfast.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.583
The eggs smell weird.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.460
Remember, the neurologist said

03:30.543 --> 03:34.631
your sense of taste and smell
might be compromised for a little while.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.217
-Here, have some toast.
-What's the point?

03:37.300 --> 03:41.429
If I can't stand eggs,
I'm not gonna magically enjoy toast.

03:44.641 --> 03:49.562
Honey, recovering
from a brain injury takes time.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.191
You've been home a couple of days.
Just go easy on yourself.

03:53.274 --> 03:58.905
I have no energy. All I do is sit around.
How much easier can I go?

03:58.988 --> 04:02.909
Right. Okay. Now, that's
what this cane is for, for your balance.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.953
-I'm not an invalid.
-Correct.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.455
But your proprioception is impaired.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.707
English, please.

04:09.791 --> 04:13.628
Your brain is having trouble sensing
where parts of your body are.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.172
They're in the same place
they've always been.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.841
All right. Good conversation.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.886
Vernon, where did
that hydrangea come from?

04:22.762 --> 04:28.184
Oh. Tara brought that by
before you came home from the hospital.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.894
Is Lilly mad at me?

04:32.397 --> 04:35.275
-Why would you ask that?
-She hasn't come over.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.736
I've called her twice,
and she hasn't called me back.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.246
What did you think of the doctor?
I liked her.

04:48.329 --> 04:54.168
She's great. I just didn't realize you
were gonna be in the high-risk category.

04:56.045 --> 04:59.424
Well, sweetheart,
I mean, I had a stillborn.

04:59.507 --> 05:05.430
Yeah, I know. I think just hearing her
say all that really brought it home.

05:05.513 --> 05:06.347
I mean...

05:09.100 --> 05:12.395
Sorry. But it's gonna be fine.

05:14.314 --> 05:18.609
-Oh, and how do you know that?
-Well, I don't, but, um...

05:19.902 --> 05:21.779
I don't know. I just feel calm.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.868
It's like my body knows
that this pregnancy is different.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.414
Oh, great. I'm glad one of us
feels like everything's under control.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.710
I just think
we should choose to have faith.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.504
-Okay, that's all we need?
-Yeah.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.800
And maternity clothes because last time
I blew up like a balloon.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.554
-I'm gonna ask Jo if she has any left.

05:47.930 --> 05:48.973
What?

05:49.057 --> 05:52.435
I didn't think we were supposed to tell
anyone until after the first trimester.

05:52.518 --> 05:56.814
Oh, well, I mean, that's not a rule.
It's really just a personal choice.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.149
Why?

05:58.232 --> 06:00.985
Well, you know, our situation is...

06:02.528 --> 06:06.074
It's a little complicated,
and there's bound to be questions,

06:06.157 --> 06:10.745
so, I just thought maybe we would
keep this between us just for now.

06:10.828 --> 06:16.542
Okay, so, you don't want me to tell Joey?
She's my sister. I tell her everything.

06:16.626 --> 06:22.173
Could you wait a little bit, like a week
until after next week's appointment?

06:22.256 --> 06:24.926
Give me a little time
to get my head around it.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.636
I can... I can do that.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.931
Wow, that was easy. I was expecting
more back and forth.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.766
You really are relaxed, aren't you?

06:31.849 --> 06:32.767
I am.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.853
You're literally grinning
from ear to ear right now.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.773
We're having a baby.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.692
-Hell yeah, we are.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.958
-Morning. Hey.
-Hey.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.172
You know, it helps if you turn it on.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.757
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.637
How's Hope doing?

07:10.972 --> 07:11.806
Not well.

07:13.474 --> 07:17.270
She doesn't remember me
telling her that Lilly had passed away.

07:17.353 --> 07:20.898
-When did you tell her?
-When she was down in South Carolina.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.944
Her subconscious must have buried it.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.739
She asked if Lilly was mad at her.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.284
-What did you say?

07:31.367 --> 07:35.997
I panicked. I told her, "Oh, well,
we'll talk about Lilly when I get home."

07:38.249 --> 07:41.419
-Do you want me to talk to her?
-No, it's gotta come from me.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.881
I just don't want anything
to impact her recovery.

07:45.715 --> 07:46.591
Yeah.

07:46.674 --> 07:51.304
I don't know. Maybe we should lie to her,
just until she gets better.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.056
No.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.434
I think you should be honest with her.

07:56.517 --> 08:00.021
Right now she depends on you,
and if she finds out you lied,

08:00.104 --> 08:03.232
it might destroy her sense of security.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.067
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.946
If you wanna go home,
I will cover for you.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.449
Oh, thanks. Jo Ellen is at the house.

08:11.532 --> 08:14.869
And besides, I wanna be here
when Dr. Hayek arrives.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.954
I can't believe
you hired him over the phone.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.123
His dad and I went
to medical school together,

08:19.207 --> 08:21.375
and I've known Cameron
since he was in shorts.

08:21.459 --> 08:25.796
I'm not trying to give you a hard time.
I'm not. He was nice on the phone.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.800
I don't remember being late
on my first day. I'm just saying.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.427
Actually, I'm right on time.

08:31.511 --> 08:37.183
Ah, there he is.
Cameron. We have been talking about you.

08:38.392 --> 08:42.355
Dr. Hayek. This is Mel Monroe,
our nurse practitioner.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.942
Please call me Cameron.
And it's nice to meet you in person.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.819
-You, too.
-How was your drive from San Diego?

08:48.903 --> 08:53.115
Not bad. I spent the night in Big Sur,
and I wouldn't mind living there.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.326
-I hope you feel at home with us.
-Thank you.

08:55.409 --> 08:59.956
Now, I cleared a little counter space
here in the exam room for your computer.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.334
-If you need anything else, let me know.
-That should be fine. Thank you.

09:03.417 --> 09:06.754
Once you're settled, we can
discuss logistics over a cup of coffee?

09:06.837 --> 09:08.172
-Mm-hm.
-Sounds good.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.674
I'll get the rest of my stuff.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.010
-I look forward to working with you, Mel.
-Uh, same.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.307
-Well, I'm offended.
-Why?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.934
When I first arrived,

09:20.017 --> 09:23.187
I was greeted with a shotgun
and asked to leave the premises.

09:23.271 --> 09:27.608
Uh-huh. My memory of those events
is vastly different than yours.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.734
Oh. Uh-huh.

09:28.818 --> 09:32.446
And also, FYI, I still don't
technically have counter space.

09:33.322 --> 09:36.784
-Gee, how can I make this up to you?
-I don't know. I have to think about it.

09:36.867 --> 09:37.952
-Mm.
-Mm-hm.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.668
I just need to get
the Wi-Fi password, please.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.462
Ha! I got no idea.

09:49.630 --> 09:53.175
Listen, anything regarding
the 21st century, just ask me.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.594
He doesn't know.

09:54.677 --> 09:55.595
-Okay.
-Yeah.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.222
So, what kind of software
do you use for scheduling?

09:58.973 --> 10:03.811
Um, we're more of like an analog office.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.146
So, that means...?

10:05.229 --> 10:06.689
You're gonna need a pen.

10:07.940 --> 10:08.899
-Right.
-Yes.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.528
Ooh. Going somewhere?

10:12.612 --> 10:15.448
-I have a job interview.
-That's cool. With who?

10:15.531 --> 10:17.908
Oh, you expect me to believe

10:17.992 --> 10:20.494
your lawyer called
and you had nothing to do with it?

10:20.578 --> 10:22.955
She's your friend.
Maybe she wants to work with you.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.334
-Come on.
-I mentioned that you're available.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.378
Oof. You are a bad liar.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.881
Well, I wasn't sure
that you'd wanna meet with her.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.924
Well, why wouldn't I?

10:35.593 --> 10:37.470
With everything that happened with Brady,

10:38.346 --> 10:40.139
wasn't sure you wanted
to stay in Virgin River.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.600
If I moved every time
a guy screwed me over,

10:42.683 --> 10:46.103
-I'd be living out of a suitcase.
-Aren't you living out of a suitcase?

10:46.187 --> 10:48.439
-Seriously?
-Sorry, couldn't help it.

10:48.522 --> 10:53.069
-Well, next time, try harder.
-This is good. I like this banter.

10:53.861 --> 10:57.073
-And that means...?
-Just want you to stay for a while.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.783
Really? Why?

10:59.784 --> 11:02.953
What do you mean? Can't a brother
wanna spend time with his sister?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.289
Yeah. Brothers who aren't you can.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.500
I'm trying to change that.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.046
I'm really enjoying
getting to know you again.

11:12.129 --> 11:15.049
You mean that?
You're not saying it to be nice?

11:15.633 --> 11:17.635
You're my sister. I don't have to be nice.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.930
-See, I can't tell if you're kidding.
-Well, that was a joke obviously.

11:21.013 --> 11:24.225
But no, look, I'm serious. For real.
Look, I love you.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.145
I would very much like it if you stayed.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.272
I love you, too.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.362
-Kick ass.
-Obviously.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.837
Those eggs are innocent bystanders, man.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.051
-You wanna talk about it?
-No.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.389
Well, I'm not very good
at taking no for an answer. So, come on.

12:03.472 --> 12:06.809
I haven't heard back from the private
investigator for a couple of days.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.145
-Oh, something'll turn up.
-Yeah.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.273
Trust me. Steve's good.
As soon as he knows something, he'll call.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.609
I just-- Thinking about Vince
with Christopher is making me crazy.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.236
I feel so damn helpless.

12:17.319 --> 12:18.821
Still no word from Paige?

12:18.904 --> 12:22.908
No, Sally was my only contact.
Obviously, she's working with Vince.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.077
Still can't believe she played me.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.998
-She must have been paid off.
-Either that or she was coerced.

12:29.498 --> 12:33.169
Well, I'm surprised you're not getting
more out of the sheriff's department.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.380
Mike says their hands are tied.
Vince is Christopher's uncle.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.967
So, without Paige, his claim
to guardianship is stronger than mine.

12:40.050 --> 12:44.930
-Well, who else knows about Christopher?
-Just you, Mel, Mike, Sheriff, and Connie.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.933
Everyone else thinks
he's back east with Paige.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.811
So, what if we go public?
Get the local news station involved?

12:50.895 --> 12:55.775
No. No. The PI says that any publicity
will just push Vince deeper underground.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.362
But if he feels anonymous,
well, eventually he'll be careless.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.615
-Making him easier to track.
-Yeah.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.621
Hey, listen. I'm sorry I wasn't
straight with you from the beginning.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.625
Come on, man. I get it.
You were protecting Paige and Christopher.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.669
Going forward, just keep me in the loop.
I might be able to help.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.590
What if Christopher thinks
I'm not even looking for him?

13:19.673 --> 13:21.091
Well, he knows you love him.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.220
He also knows you're
not gonna stop looking till you find him.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.612
Now, I would have taken
that trash out, eventually.

13:42.112 --> 13:46.575
Hope is taking a nap, so I just tidied up
a bit, and now I'm heading home.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.537
I can't thank you enough
for all you've done.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.038
-Takes a village.
-Yeah.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.959
Oh, um... How was your visit with Hope?

13:55.042 --> 13:58.295
I was hoping that she'd
be back to her old self by now.

13:58.796 --> 14:02.007
We played three rounds of gin.
She didn't try to cheat.

14:02.091 --> 14:05.469
That's the thing
with traumatic brain injuries.

14:05.553 --> 14:10.266
The normal symptoms, you know,
memory loss, fatigue, and headaches...

14:10.808 --> 14:12.893
they directly impact personality.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.354
-What do her doctors say?
-Wait and see.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.314
All right, then.

14:18.816 --> 14:19.984
Oh, oh, oh.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.279
Whatever happened
with that young man, Denny something?

14:23.362 --> 14:25.155
Now, I don't know who that is.

14:25.239 --> 14:28.284
-You didn't get my message?
-I must have missed it.

14:28.367 --> 14:32.329
While you were at the hospital with Hope,
a young man checked into the B&B,

14:32.413 --> 14:35.791
said he was looking
for his grandfather, Vernon Mullins.

14:36.417 --> 14:40.462
Well, I can't be his grandfather.
I never had any children.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.174
Well, that's what I thought,
but he seemed so sure of himself.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.218
-Anywho, see you later.
-See you.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.928
-Hi.
-Hi, Lizzie!

14:48.012 --> 14:49.388
-Hey, Lizzie!
-Hey, Doc.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.848
Whatcha got there?

14:50.931 --> 14:53.684
I made potato soup
and corn fritters for you and Hope.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.812
Oh, thank you. That is very sweet.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.148
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.567
What? This is plenty.
And you got a friend in town.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.236
Parker? Oh, he left last week.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.574
I could have gone with him, but I've
decided to be on my own for a while.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.117
Good for you.

15:10.200 --> 15:14.371
Oh, and if you have some spare time,
Hope's roses are on death's door.

15:14.455 --> 15:18.000
I've been watering them,
but I think they need fertilizer.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.587
-Okay, and if you want, I can pull weeds.
-That's wonderful.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.715
And everything you'll need,
you'll find in the gardening shed.

15:24.798 --> 15:29.011
Oh, and I have to pop over to the clinic
this afternoon.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.305
-Could you keep an eye on Hope?
-Sure.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.265
Thank you.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.809
I had no idea you were a garden pro.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.145
I'm not. That's what Google's for.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.781
-Oh, hey. Uh...
-Oh.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.660
-You look nice.
-Oh, thanks.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.162
-I just had a job interview.
-How'd it go?

15:55.245 --> 15:59.833
-She offered me the job. So, it went well.
-Oh, that's great. Congratulations.

15:59.917 --> 16:03.545
Well, I'd have to commit to a year.
So, I'm not sure I'm gonna take it.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.507
Brie, I'm sorry about the mess with Brady.

16:06.590 --> 16:09.885
I know he told you that I have it out
for him, but I was doing my job.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.680
It's fine. I don't blame you.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.811
I know how it feels
to be blindsided by someone.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.188
Did one of your ex-girlfriends
shoot your brother?

16:21.271 --> 16:22.106
No.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.943
Uh, if you ever wanna hang out,

16:26.026 --> 16:31.031
just talk, or just whatever,
you know, I'm around.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.700
I thought you were going to L.A.

16:32.783 --> 16:37.287
I was, but then, the sheriff asked me
to stay on. So, I'm gonna be here.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.833
-What made you wanna stay?
-I like it here. Air's clean.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.336
People are nice to each other.
It's beautiful.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.631
-Oh. Sorry.
-Oh, no. Go, yeah.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.091
-Hey, grab it.
-Yeah. Sorry.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.718
-I'll see you around. Bye.
-Mm-hm.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.645
Come on. I'm open.

17:12.489 --> 17:15.659
-You're looking like crap.
-Jimmy.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.245
Heard you were in here.

17:18.328 --> 17:21.540
-You hear that from your police friends?
-They ain't my friends.

17:21.623 --> 17:25.169
You ain't got a lot of friends in here.
A lot of guys got swept up in the raid.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.670
They're blaming you.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.714
I had nothing to do with the raid, Jimmy.

17:29.423 --> 17:33.010
If you'd taken care of Spencer
like you were supposed to,

17:33.093 --> 17:36.055
the feds wouldn't
be coming down on us at all.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.891
-You got a point?
-No.

17:39.892 --> 17:40.726
No point.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.071
You know that guy?

17:53.322 --> 17:54.156
Sort of.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.826
-He's a psycho.
-A lot of those around here.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.206
Yeah, well, Jimmy's a little punk.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.710
You look outnumbered to me.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.688
-Oh, Mel.
-Hi.

18:27.189 --> 18:31.068
So, listen, inquiring minds wanna know.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.946
Is this new doctor as cute as they say?

18:34.947 --> 18:37.908
Right. Who is "they"?

18:37.991 --> 18:41.453
Selma Linton said
that his smile was dazzling.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.997
Well, Marge Cooper says he's dreamy.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.791
Marilyn Brown called dibs.

18:45.874 --> 18:49.503
Well, that's just ridiculous, isn't it?
Marilyn is married.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.797
Cameron, though, does he have a wife?

18:52.548 --> 18:55.259
-Uh, I don't know. I don't think so.
-Does who have a wife?

18:55.342 --> 19:00.139
Doc hired a very attractive doctor
to fill in at the clinic,

19:00.222 --> 19:02.474
so he could spend more time with Hope.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.811
It's about time you got
a bit of competition, mister.

19:05.894 --> 19:09.106
Well, I wasn't aware a lack
of competition was a concern, is it?

19:09.189 --> 19:12.734
I'm just saying, you know,
you might wanna stay on your toes.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.236
Right. Um...

19:14.736 --> 19:18.574
-Would you help me get my lunch order?
-Yeah. I got something to show you.

19:19.783 --> 19:22.119
Excuse me, ladies.
I have to get back to work.

19:24.371 --> 19:28.959
So, after I dropped you off this morning,
I went by Kings Pharmacy.

19:30.085 --> 19:35.132
And I got you some
extra prenatal vitamins. Very important.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.133
Oh...

19:36.216 --> 19:42.264
A few books on high-risk pregnancies,
blood pressure cuff. That's for you.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.348
Uh-huh.

19:43.432 --> 19:47.060
And the FT 300 Fetal Doppler.

19:47.144 --> 19:50.981
After 12 weeks, we can monitor
the baby's heart rate whenever we want.

19:51.064 --> 19:54.860
-Isn't that cool? And look at this.
-Jack...

19:56.278 --> 19:58.197
We should check this place out.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.824
Fetal Maternal Center's
one of the top-rated

20:00.908 --> 20:03.202
neonatal facilities in the country.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.288
Yeah, it's a very prestigious clinic.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.458
Jack, this is so sweet.

20:09.541 --> 20:15.005
Thank you for picking up all this stuff,
and, you know, researching clinics, but...

20:15.505 --> 20:17.466
But what? What?

20:17.549 --> 20:20.886
If you're stressed out about me
having a high-risk pregnancy, it's okay.

20:20.969 --> 20:24.056
-We can talk about it.
-I know. And I would talk to you about it.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.183
This is just me doing my homework.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.728
-Okay.
-Look, we got this.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.104
-Yeah.
-Okay?

20:31.188 --> 20:32.022
Yeah.

20:34.191 --> 20:37.736
-What?
-Just like looking at you.

20:39.988 --> 20:44.117
-Have I told you how beautiful you are?
-Not since this morning, so...

20:44.201 --> 20:46.954
-Oh, well, we need to fix that.
-Yeah.

20:47.537 --> 20:48.956
Let me tell you more.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.970
What are you doing to Amy?

21:03.595 --> 21:09.476
I told Doc I'd fertilize the roses and get
rid of some of the weeds. Who's Amy?

21:10.060 --> 21:10.978
Her.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.523
-I didn't know she had a name.
-They all do.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.151
Josephine, Meg, Beth.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.238
Aren't those
the sisters from <i>Little Women?</i>

21:21.321 --> 21:23.282
Finally. Somebody gets it.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.412
So, do you need me to get you anything?

21:29.246 --> 21:32.541
Um, I'd like for you
to drive me over to Lilly's.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.294
Sure. I'll call Tara
and see if she's home.

21:35.377 --> 21:40.382
-No, I just wanna visit Lilly.
-At the cemetery on the farm?

21:42.384 --> 21:44.136
Why would we go there?

21:44.219 --> 21:48.807
Well, because that's where Lilly is.

21:50.225 --> 21:54.563
What are you talking about?
What happened to Lilly?

21:55.522 --> 21:56.565
Um...

21:57.899 --> 21:59.568
Nothing. Lilly's fine.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.989
You stay here. I'll wash my hands,
and then, we'll figure it out.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.665
Yeah. Doc Mullins here.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.959
It's Lizzie. You have to come home.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.628
What? Lizzie, what happened? Is Hope okay?

22:19.504 --> 22:22.466
She asked me to drive her to Lilly's,
and I mentioned the cemetery

22:22.549 --> 22:25.552
because I assumed she knew Lilly died,
and then, I freaked out

22:25.635 --> 22:27.512
and told her Lilly is still alive.

22:27.596 --> 22:31.266
Okay, easy. Don't get worked up.
I'll be on my way right now.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.185
<i>So, what do I tell Hope in the meantime?</i>

22:33.268 --> 22:35.395
You tell her that Vernon is on his way,

22:35.479 --> 22:38.106
and he will drive her
wherever she wants to go.

22:51.870 --> 22:52.871
Hey.

22:52.954 --> 22:55.374
-Hey.
-Picked up some lunch.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.084
-Oh, thanks.
-Mm-hm.

22:57.167 --> 23:00.545
I don't think we have time to eat.
Is it always like this?

23:00.629 --> 23:03.632
-You mean a waiting room full of women?
-Yeah.

23:03.715 --> 23:06.176
No, they're all here to meet you.

23:06.259 --> 23:07.677
Professionally speaking.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.679
No, no, no. Personally speaking.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.017
Why?

23:14.101 --> 23:18.605
Because you're new,
you're young, you're nice-looking.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.941
I've only been in town
for less than a day.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.194
Here's how Virgin River
was explained to me.

23:24.277 --> 23:27.197
The Internet is slow,
but the gossip is fast.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.575
-So I'm the gossip.
-Mm-hm. Why don't you eat your lunch,

23:30.659 --> 23:34.246
and I'll figure out if these ladies
need medical attention.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.914
No, no, no. Just enjoy your lunch.

23:35.997 --> 23:39.376
They came to see me,
and I wouldn't wanna disappoint anyone.

23:40.877 --> 23:41.837
Okay.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.390
Jo. Hi.

23:53.473 --> 23:56.560
You've been dodging me for a week.
What is going on?

23:56.643 --> 23:58.353
<i>Well, I left you a message.</i>

23:58.437 --> 24:00.272
I can hear it in your voice.

24:01.022 --> 24:03.525
Is it Jack? Are you sick?

24:03.608 --> 24:06.778
-No, we're both fine.
<i>-No, you're not. I can tell.</i>

24:06.862 --> 24:08.405
<i>Do you need me to come up there?</i>

24:08.488 --> 24:11.116
Of course not.
That's-- Don't be ridiculous.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.617
Tell me what's wrong.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.286
<i>I can't.</i>

24:14.953 --> 24:18.165
Mel. Please. You're scaring me.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.837
I'm pregnant.

24:24.963 --> 24:29.217
-You're pregnant?
<i>-Yeah, I'm pregnant. </i>

24:29.301 --> 24:31.887
And I don't know who the father is.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.181
How is that possible?

24:34.264 --> 24:36.475
<i>Well, like you suggested,</i>
<i>when I was in L.A.,</i>

24:36.558 --> 24:38.101
<i>I went and I did a round of IVF,</i>

24:38.185 --> 24:42.772
<i>and then I came back,</i>
<i>and Jack and I got back together and...</i>

24:44.065 --> 24:50.030
Well, I mean, however this happened,
Mel, honey, this is incredible.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.032
<i>I know. It is, isn't it?</i>

24:52.824 --> 24:54.826
-Yeah.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

24:54.910 --> 24:56.411
How are you feeling?

24:56.495 --> 24:59.247
I don't know. I'm still in shock, I think.

25:00.040 --> 25:04.419
I mean, you know, first of all,
I didn't think I could get pregnant again,

25:04.503 --> 25:10.258
and then, you know, everything is
so crazy with Jack and IVF and...

25:12.928 --> 25:16.932
Well, nobody
deserves this more than you.

25:17.974 --> 25:20.852
I mean,
you have wanted a baby for so long.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.522
Yeah.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.652
Can't believe it's finally happening.

25:34.574 --> 25:35.951
Hey, what's up?

25:36.660 --> 25:39.913
I ran into Brie right after her interview.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.123
She said she got an offer.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.543
-Oh, good for her.
-Yeah.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.962
You guys talk about anything besides work?

25:47.504 --> 25:49.714
-What, you mean did I ask her out?
-Mm-hm.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.383
-Yeah.
-And?

25:51.466 --> 25:57.013
I said if she wants to hang out,
you know, I'm around.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.433
That's it?
That's the best you got? "I'm around"?

26:00.934 --> 26:05.438
I don't know what it is, man.
I got no game when I'm with her.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.941
You don't need game with Brie,
just be yourself.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.026
-Yeah.
-Here you go.

26:11.027 --> 26:11.945
Thanks.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.323
So any word on Brady?

26:15.407 --> 26:19.160
Yeah, he requested a bail hearing,
but, I mean, the courts are backed up.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.288
He's not getting out soon.

26:21.371 --> 26:22.622
How much is bail?

26:22.706 --> 26:23.790
Five hundred K.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.876
Oof. That's steep.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.754
Yeah, 'cause he shot you
and left you for dead.

26:33.174 --> 26:34.009
What?

26:35.719 --> 26:37.929
Don't tell me you're having doubts.

26:40.098 --> 26:43.977
Look, Brady is Brady. But he's not dumb.

26:45.020 --> 26:48.106
Driving around with a gun in the Jeep.
Come on. It doesn't track.

26:48.189 --> 26:50.358
Jack, the gun was a match.

26:53.278 --> 26:56.990
-Something's not sitting right with me.
-Yeah, 'cause you're a good guy,

26:57.073 --> 27:02.621
and that level of betrayal just--
You can't wrap your head around it.

27:03.913 --> 27:04.998
Well, maybe.

27:23.767 --> 27:27.687
-What happened after we hung up?
-She wanted to come inside and lie down.

27:27.771 --> 27:31.775
-Did she say anything else about Lilly?
-All she said was that she was tired.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.193
Isn't that weird?

27:33.276 --> 27:36.279
I am so sorry. I totally freaked her out.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.782
No, no, no, please. Don't.
You did the right thing.

27:38.865 --> 27:42.410
You called me and you kept Hope safe.
That's all that matters.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.635
-Easy, big fella.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.390
How's it going?

28:03.473 --> 28:05.642
There's a raccoon stealing our silverware.

28:05.725 --> 28:09.896
Oh, yeah. That is Bandit.
He comes and goes.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.399
What are we gonna do about him?

28:12.482 --> 28:13.775
Cayenne pepper, hot sauce,

28:13.858 --> 28:16.611
gallon of water,
and a teaspoon of dishwashing liquid.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.906
-You can't poison Bandit.
-Relax, Ricky. It's a spray.

28:20.407 --> 28:23.827
-They don't like the smell.
-I should take that to boot camp.

28:23.910 --> 28:28.623
-Keep the guys from messing with me.
-What did Jack say about you enlisting?

28:29.791 --> 28:32.460
He... He didn't say anything.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.671
Because I haven't told him.

28:35.296 --> 28:39.843
Ricky, how do you think he's gonna feel
if he finds out from somebody else?

28:40.969 --> 28:45.140
-I hadn't thought about that.
-Quit procrastinating. That's an order.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.811
I'll deal with Bandit.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.563
Yeah.

28:52.897 --> 28:57.527
But there's not enough water pressure.
So when can you take a look at it?

28:59.779 --> 29:02.282
That will be fine. Thank you.

29:02.365 --> 29:04.159
Hello, Charmaine, nice to see you.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.662
Hi, so my aunt
wants to throw me this baby shower,

29:07.746 --> 29:10.415
but the country club is booked
until the end of the end of the year.

29:10.498 --> 29:13.668
-Okay.
-So could we have it here on your patio?

29:13.752 --> 29:16.087
-How many people on the guest list?
-Fifteen to 20.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.338
Not a problem.

29:17.422 --> 29:21.092
Oh, that's so great.
I love your garden and your courtyard.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.471
Oh, thank you.
Nick and I are quite proud of it.

29:24.554 --> 29:27.640
Speaking of proud,
you must be so excited about the twins.

29:27.724 --> 29:31.102
I am. Super excited
and super stressed out.

29:31.186 --> 29:34.898
I mean, like, there's so much to do
and I have total baby brain.

29:34.981 --> 29:38.526
I don't even know
what color blue to paint the nursery.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.945
Does that mean
you're expecting boys?

29:41.654 --> 29:43.072
Oh. Uh...

29:43.156 --> 29:45.700
-Yeah.
-Oh! Jack must be thrilled.

29:45.784 --> 29:49.746
Jack doesn't know yet. We just found out.

29:49.829 --> 29:53.082
So please don't say anything to Jack
or anyone else.

29:53.166 --> 29:56.711
-Mum's the word.
-Thanks.

29:58.004 --> 30:00.757
-Did you sign your contract?
-Not yet.

30:02.509 --> 30:08.348
Jack, I know you want me
to go to college, but this is what I want.

30:10.850 --> 30:16.564
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner,
but I didn't wanna disappoint you.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.400
You don't have to explain yourself.

30:20.735 --> 30:24.656
You're an adult.
It's time you make your own decisions.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.992
Wait, you're not mad?

30:28.618 --> 30:30.203
I'm not mad at you.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.415
I'm proud of you.

30:37.252 --> 30:41.339
You're following your own dreams.
Something I understand.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.718
You gotta promise me one thing.

30:46.719 --> 30:51.808
When it's time for you to go to boot camp,
I'm driving you and Lydie to the bus stop.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.144
That'd be awesome.

30:56.604 --> 30:57.939
Proud of you, man.

30:59.232 --> 31:02.026
Hey, make sure
you spend time with your grandma.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.444
She's gonna miss you.

31:04.028 --> 31:07.574
Thanks, Jack,
for being cool about everything.

31:21.504 --> 31:26.843
Um, have you seen Gloria Gold's chart?
Her blood test results just came in.

31:27.552 --> 31:30.054
-Anemia?
-Yeah, you're good.

31:30.138 --> 31:32.849
She was textbook,
but thanks for the compliment.

31:33.349 --> 31:37.061
-Thank you.
-Man, today was great.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.816
-What?
-Are you always this positive?

31:41.900 --> 31:44.527
Oh, it's genetic.
My mom is an event planner,

31:44.611 --> 31:47.155
and my dad is the most
optimistic person you'll meet.

31:47.238 --> 31:50.074
Mix the two together,
and this is what you get.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.242
Aha.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.952
Makes perfect sense.

31:53.036 --> 31:55.788
How about you?
Are you a pessimist or an optimist?

31:55.872 --> 31:58.791
I would say half optimist, half realist.

31:58.875 --> 32:02.921
-Which means?
-Which means I'm a hopeful control freak.

32:03.004 --> 32:06.215
There's a lot of debate going on up here.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.467
I like it.

32:08.301 --> 32:13.306
Okay. Try this. At the end of every shift,
I like to ask whoever I'm with

32:13.389 --> 32:15.099
what the high point of their day was.

32:15.683 --> 32:20.188
Okay, um, the high point of my day

32:20.271 --> 32:23.066
would have to be
when I convinced Mrs. Tilden

32:23.149 --> 32:26.152
that psoriasis is not contagious.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.571
What about you?

32:28.655 --> 32:30.239
When you said I was attractive.

32:30.323 --> 32:34.911
Oh, wow. You're-- Okay. I didn't say that.

32:34.994 --> 32:38.081
You said I was nice-looking,
but we all know what that meant.

32:38.164 --> 32:41.042
You're delirious,
and you need to take a break.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.795
Actually, I was about to go for a run.

32:44.295 --> 32:47.423
Oh, the Blue Creek Trailhead is
right next to the B&B.

32:47.507 --> 32:48.675
That's my favorite.

32:48.758 --> 32:51.260
-Oh, you run.
-Mm-hm. Every chance I get.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.888
-Maybe I'll see you on the trail sometime.
-Yeah.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.933
-Good night.
-Good night. See you tomorrow.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.156
Hey.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.576
Where's Lizzie?

33:15.660 --> 33:18.871
-Connie took her home.
-Oh.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.459
Oh, my head is killing me.

33:24.085 --> 33:27.046
-Can you bring me some aspirin?
-Of course.

33:34.303 --> 33:35.680
Here you go.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.433
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.192
You got it?

33:49.027 --> 33:50.028
Yeah.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.825
Vernon. When did Lilly die?

33:59.912 --> 34:01.205
How did you know?

34:02.498 --> 34:05.001
Lilly was the queen of sending cards.

34:05.084 --> 34:09.714
No matter how mad she was at me,
she would have sent at least one.

34:12.258 --> 34:14.010
I had forgotten about that.

34:14.761 --> 34:19.182
-Every occasion, whether good or bad--
-My favorite was Groundhog Day.

34:20.183 --> 34:23.728
-Who does that?
-Oh, only Lilly. Lilly.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.105
It wasn't just the card.

34:27.106 --> 34:31.569
The look on poor Lizzie's face
when I asked her about Lilly.

34:32.070 --> 34:32.904
Yeah.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.618
Please tell me what happened.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.287
Okay.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.918
When you were in South Carolina,

34:47.418 --> 34:51.047
Lilly was diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer.

34:53.424 --> 34:58.429
She wanted to tell you in person,
and I respected her wishes.

34:59.055 --> 35:03.559
Then one day,
I went out to visit her and Tara.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.479
Tara was making dinner,
and Lilly took a nap.

35:07.021 --> 35:10.858
And while she was sleeping,
she suffered a stroke.

35:12.401 --> 35:13.820
She never woke up.

35:14.904 --> 35:18.157
She died peacefully. I promise you.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.451
She didn't suffer.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.709
And the day of your accident,
you were on your way home for her funeral.

35:30.336 --> 35:33.339
And on your way here from the airport...

36:11.627 --> 36:12.461
Got it.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.422
Okay.

36:16.090 --> 36:18.134
Yep. All right.
We'll get back to you. Bye.

36:19.927 --> 36:22.513
-Hey. Aw. Thanks.
-For you.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.099
So how was work?

36:25.725 --> 36:26.851
Work was good.

36:26.934 --> 36:32.899
Um, listen... so I told Joey.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.317
-What?
-I'm sorry.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.820
I was talking to her on the phone
and she started to panic,

36:37.904 --> 36:41.657
and I didn't want her to worry.
I couldn't do that to her, so I just--

36:41.741 --> 36:44.327
-It's okay. I get it.
-Okay.

36:44.827 --> 36:49.999
Well, listen, I promise that we will
not tell anyone else until we are ready.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.960
Well, I'm gonna hold you to that. Okay?

36:53.794 --> 37:00.051
In the meantime, I was thinking
maybe we could fly down to L.A.

37:00.676 --> 37:04.055
-Okay, why?
-I just spoke to that clinic.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.058
See if they were taking new patients,
and they are.

37:07.141 --> 37:08.851
I thought we could do a consult.

37:09.727 --> 37:11.729
Okay. Um...

37:12.396 --> 37:14.857
Well, I think that in the future,

37:14.941 --> 37:17.026
if we end up needing additional care,
then sure.

37:17.109 --> 37:21.364
But for now,
I'm really comfortable with Dr. Lorton.

37:21.447 --> 37:25.243
I just don't feel like I can sit back
and wait for something bad to happen.

37:28.871 --> 37:29.747
Um...

37:30.998 --> 37:35.127
Look, Mark and I,

37:35.211 --> 37:39.048
you know, we-- we did everything
by the books.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.510
We had the best prenatal care.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.182
And we still lost our baby.

37:50.309 --> 37:54.730
So if I focus on "what ifs,"
then I'm not gonna be able to function.

37:56.691 --> 37:57.942
I get it.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.152
Okay.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.446
I don't want that to happen to us.

38:03.072 --> 38:06.450
-No.
-I'm just trying to support you.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.245
I know.

38:09.996 --> 38:14.208
I know. And that makes me feel loved.
And that's all I need right now.

38:46.866 --> 38:50.453
-Nope. Sorry, we're not interested.
-Sir, I'm not here to sell you anything.

38:51.203 --> 38:53.372
Rose Miller gave me your name.

38:53.456 --> 38:54.415
What?

38:56.167 --> 38:59.170
Look, you've got the wrong Vernon Mullins.

38:59.253 --> 39:02.882
The only Rose Miller I ever knew
died 40 years ago.

39:08.721 --> 39:11.766
-Where'd you get this?
-She said you might not believe me.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.685
She wanted you to have it.

39:16.562 --> 39:17.605
Rose?

39:19.106 --> 39:20.900
Rose is alive?

39:20.983 --> 39:23.235
Mm-hm. She's my grandmother.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.864
And I'm your grandson.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.595
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.306
I need you to see something the PI sent.

39:54.308 --> 39:55.643
What's wrong?

40:00.064 --> 40:02.024
-What am I looking at?
-Just keep watching.

40:27.716 --> 40:31.679
-Who is that?
-It's Vince, the guy who took Christopher.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.270
So it wasn't Brady.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.940
-What?
-Brady didn't shoot me.

40:45.401 --> 40:46.527
Vince did.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.211
How you doing?

41:06.630 --> 41:07.798
Couldn't be better.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.594
It's tough in the beginning,
but you'll get used to it.

41:12.261 --> 41:16.682
Well, it's not my first stint, and
I don't plan on being here much longer.

41:19.351 --> 41:20.853
You might be right.

41:27.693 --> 41:29.111
You earned this.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.283
Come on.

41:34.366 --> 41:35.201
Jimmy!

41:36.952 --> 41:40.623
Next time you come at me,
I ain't gonna be so nice.

41:48.088 --> 41:49.924
Jimmy's my cousin, you son of a bitch.

42:03.854 --> 42:07.399
Inmates, on the ground! On the ground!

42:07.483 --> 42:08.776
Secure the yard!

42:09.318 --> 42:11.362
Inmate down. Secure the yard.

42:12.154 --> 42:17.159
We need a medic stat. We need backup!
