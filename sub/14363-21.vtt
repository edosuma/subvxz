WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:04.970
[Crow caws]

00:04.971 --> 00:07.305
Tag: We got to clear a whole path for him.

00:07.306 --> 00:09.474
Hey, dad. Grandpa's
brother's coming over here.

00:09.475 --> 00:11.476
- Why?
- I'll tell you why.

00:11.477 --> 00:14.012
'Cause he's old and he
thinks we're gonna die.

00:14.013 --> 00:15.013
Okay.

00:15.014 --> 00:16.448
But why is he coming here?

00:16.449 --> 00:17.549
Frankie?

00:17.550 --> 00:20.218
W... look, my mom's out of town

00:20.219 --> 00:22.053
on her red hat society Riverboat Cruise,

00:22.054 --> 00:23.989
and Uncle Dutch is coming here 'cause...

00:23.990 --> 00:25.757
He's coming here 'cause I don't want

00:25.758 --> 00:27.826
to be stuck in my house just me and him.

00:27.827 --> 00:29.728
My brother's not much of a talker.

00:29.729 --> 00:32.764
He's not a natural
conversationalist, like me.

00:32.765 --> 00:34.132
I like him already.

00:34.133 --> 00:36.235
Look, Mike, you know I've
had a pain in my heart

00:36.236 --> 00:38.303
that my dad and his brother
have had this rift.

00:38.304 --> 00:41.039
And now he's reaching out to
him after all these years.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.775
You know I always say "you do for family."

00:43.776 --> 00:45.844
Well, do before they're dead.
That's my new one.

00:45.845 --> 00:49.147
Hey! Less chatty-chatty over
there and more worky-worky.

00:49.148 --> 00:50.882
You got to move that table there

00:50.883 --> 00:53.051
in case he's in a wheelchair.

00:53.052 --> 00:55.220
I mean, heaven knows what
kind of shape he's in.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.757
He's older than me.

00:59.058 --> 01:00.192
[Door closes]

01:00.193 --> 01:02.794
Axl, the worst thing that
could ever happen to me

01:02.795 --> 01:04.763
has happened to me.

01:04.763 --> 01:06.031
I got detention.

01:06.032 --> 01:07.866
Hm. What'd you do...
over-decorate your locker?

01:07.867 --> 01:09.167
No.

01:09.168 --> 01:11.770
Remember how you're not allowed
to leave campus at lunch?

01:11.771 --> 01:13.071
Well, some kids were going to Arby's

01:13.072 --> 01:14.906
because they were serving
beanies and weenies

01:14.907 --> 01:16.208
in the cafeteria that day,

01:16.209 --> 01:17.276
and I got busted.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.312
Did you guys sneak off campus?

01:21.748 --> 01:22.814
Did I teach you nothing?!

01:22.815 --> 01:24.850
You always point to the
person on your right.

01:24.851 --> 01:27.319
Ugh. This isn't funny, Axl!

01:27.320 --> 01:29.721
I am gonna have a permanent
black mark on my record.

01:29.722 --> 01:31.723
Plus, how am I supposed to
tell mom and dad? How?!

01:31.724 --> 01:32.958
Here's how you tell mom and dad.

01:32.959 --> 01:33.992
[Snaps fingers]

01:33.993 --> 01:35.727
What's that? Charades? [Gasps]

01:35.728 --> 01:38.363
You think I should tell them in
a game so they won't be so mad.

01:38.364 --> 01:39.966
No. You're not gonna tell them at all.

01:41.701 --> 01:42.901
What?!

01:42.902 --> 01:44.736
First, I'm breaking school bylaws,

01:44.737 --> 01:46.772
and now I'm withholding
information from my parents.

01:46.773 --> 01:47.774
Who am I?!

01:50.209 --> 01:52.411
Geez, I'm sorry I'm not helping,

01:52.412 --> 01:54.980
but this damn arthritis in my hip.

01:54.981 --> 01:57.449
No need to explain why
you're not helping, Tag.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.785
You set the bar pretty low.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.186
Hey!

02:01.187 --> 02:02.721
Rug on a rug.

02:02.722 --> 02:04.289
That's like a deathtrap.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.158
And move that ottoman there.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.193
He'll trip right over that thing.

02:08.193 --> 02:10.961
[Knock on door]

02:10.963 --> 02:13.165
Hello, Heck family. [Chuckles]

02:13.166 --> 02:14.399
Uh-oh.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.803
Rug on a rug... that's a deathtrap.

02:18.004 --> 02:19.805
Uncle Dutch!

02:19.806 --> 02:20.807
[Both laugh]

02:24.844 --> 02:26.713
Here's your cane, Mike.

02:29.437 --> 02:31.751
And this is my husband, Mike.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.686
Mike, don't forget your cane.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.122
He's got a pain in his hip. Tell him, Mike.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.190
[Sighs] Yeah. I do.

02:38.191 --> 02:41.160
But, uh, lately, it's been
moving a little farther south.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.396
- Nice to finally meet you, Dutch.
- Likewise, Mike.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.765
I'm sorry it couldn't have
been a little sooner.

02:46.766 --> 02:48.800
There is the guy I want to see.

02:48.801 --> 02:50.068
Get over here, buddy.

02:50.069 --> 02:51.903
Ahh, you get over here.

02:51.904 --> 02:53.705
[Both laugh]

02:53.706 --> 02:56.742
Standing and hugging is for strangers.

02:56.743 --> 02:59.378
Plus, I don't want to show
Mike up with my great hip.

02:59.379 --> 03:00.746
Frankie: Aww!

03:00.747 --> 03:03.115
So, how are you, Uncle Dutch?
How are things in Vegas?

03:03.116 --> 03:04.783
Got to be more exciting than Orson.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.451
Well, I'm keeping myself busy.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.186
Business has been pretty good, though.

03:08.187 --> 03:10.856
I probably work too hard,
but it keeps me young.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.023
Sure don't keep him humble.

03:12.024 --> 03:14.226
So, what exactly you do out there, Dutch?

03:14.227 --> 03:15.360
I'm in the vac business.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.695
Oh, just like grandpa Tag.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.897
Well, actually, I was in the vac biz.

03:18.898 --> 03:21.666
Now I've got a little
carpet-cleaning company.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.402
Oh, it's not little. It's huge.

03:23.403 --> 03:24.770
Dutch's speedy clean.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.171
They call him the king of carpets.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.773
He's even in the commercials.

03:27.774 --> 03:30.041
Wait. You're actually on TV?

03:30.042 --> 03:31.276
Do you know David Tutera?

03:31.277 --> 03:32.811
Axl: Oh, my God. Sue, they
don't care about that.

03:32.812 --> 03:35.714
Have you met the Godaddy Girl
from the Super Bowl commercials?

03:35.715 --> 03:38.350
[Chuckling] Oh, no. Just
a little local commercial.

03:38.351 --> 03:40.385
I sing a jingle, you know?
Nothing glamorous.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.255
You sing a jingle?! I love jingles!

03:43.256 --> 03:44.856
Can you sing it for us right now?

03:44.857 --> 03:47.125
[Chuckling] You don't want
to hear this old guy sing.

03:47.126 --> 03:49.161
Can I borrow your cane?

03:49.162 --> 03:50.862

You know, the real talent in this
family is this guy right here.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.726
When we were in high school,
we did a little number.

04:21.726 --> 04:24.429
We used to do it on the
local talent contest.

the Cletus Wilson radio show.

a few dance steps, and Bob's your Uncle.

Wait. We have another Uncle in
the family I don't know about?

04:39.045 --> 04:41.179
This is like the "Secret Family"
episode of "Cateline."

04:41.180 --> 04:44.216
No, son, it's an expression, like an idiom.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.717
Oh! I love idioms.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.352
Actually, I have a whole book of them.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.187
Do you want me to go get it
and I can read you some?

04:49.188 --> 04:50.422
Brick, he's here to sing and dance

04:50.423 --> 04:51.823
and reunite with his estranged brother,

not to hear you read.

Go ahead, guys.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.862
Come on, Tag. Let's show 'em what we got.

04:56.863 --> 04:57.896
Can't.

04:57.897 --> 04:59.831
Mike's got to take a whiz,

04:59.832 --> 05:02.234
and he needs my help getting to the can.

like a spaghetti strainer.

05:13.746 --> 05:15.247
There's been a development.

I know... you're getting uglier.

05:16.415 --> 05:17.983

05:23.689 --> 05:24.689
[Sighs] Okay.

05:24.690 --> 05:26.725
I just got an e-mail from the school.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.693
I didn't just get regular detention.

05:28.694 --> 05:30.161
I got Saturday detention.

05:30.162 --> 05:31.329
Whoa!

05:31.330 --> 05:33.331
On a first violation... that is hard-core.

05:33.332 --> 05:34.366
Yeah.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.800
They said 'cause school's ending soon,

05:35.801 --> 05:37.802
they're just throwing
everyone in on a Saturday.

05:37.803 --> 05:39.905
That means I am gonna be
in with the skateboarders,

05:39.906 --> 05:41.706
the girl with the black lipstick,

05:41.707 --> 05:43.708
people who wear t-shirts
with offensive slogans.

05:43.709 --> 05:44.843
Relax.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.678
I've done a few Saturday tours.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.713
Now, if you want to get out of
there with both your eyebrows,

05:48.714 --> 05:49.882
[snaps fingers] Listen and learn.

05:53.085 --> 05:54.152
Okay.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.154
Number 1, do not bring that binder.

05:56.155 --> 05:58.690
Number 2, you're gonna want
to buy some protection,

05:58.691 --> 06:01.226
so you want to load up
on the snacks, you know?

06:01.227 --> 06:02.360
Goldfish, candy bars...

06:02.361 --> 06:03.428
Kit Kats... they're great

06:03.429 --> 06:04.829
'cause you can break them up into fours.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.831
And then I'll be okay?

06:06.832 --> 06:08.033
Oh, no. No, no, no.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.434
I'll be amazed if you survive.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.837
But hey, at least your
last meal will be candy.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.741
Well, when you called me at work,

06:16.742 --> 06:19.844
you never mentioned this was
gonna be a slumber party.

06:19.845 --> 06:21.680
Oh, wait. You never called me at work.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.281
All right, would you let it go already?

06:23.282 --> 06:26.818
The important thing is, my dad
and his brother are reuniting.

06:26.819 --> 06:28.736
I don't know what show you're watching,

06:28.737 --> 06:29.770
but I'm not getting the sense

06:29.771 --> 06:31.525
this thing's gonna have a happy ending.

06:31.526 --> 06:33.425
What are they even fighting about, anyway?

06:34.026 --> 06:36.394
Why can't I remember what it is?
It doesn't matter.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.496
Look, what matters is
that they're here now,

06:38.497 --> 06:41.065
and it's our job to facilitate the healing.

06:41.066 --> 06:43.301
[Sighs] I already got
a lot of jobs, Frankie.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.236
And if I'm ranking them
according to preference,

06:45.237 --> 06:47.305
facilitating the healing
doesn't even make the list.

06:47.306 --> 06:49.774
You know what your problem is?
You're a naysayer.

06:49.775 --> 06:51.509
People say things, and you "nay" them.

06:51.510 --> 06:54.145
I'm not a naysayer. I'm a realist.

06:54.146 --> 06:56.314
Trust me... people don't change.

06:56.315 --> 06:59.150
Your problem is you're
always holding on to hope.

06:59.151 --> 07:01.319
I'm telling you... once you let go of hope,

07:01.320 --> 07:03.088
it's very freeing.

07:04.289 --> 07:05.724
[Sighs]

07:07.159 --> 07:08.227
[Groans]

07:13.865 --> 07:14.865
[Laughter]

07:14.866 --> 07:16.901
Oh, my God.

07:16.902 --> 07:19.303
You know, but I think my favorite story is,

07:19.304 --> 07:21.906
we were cleaning the
carpets at Caesars Palace.

07:21.907 --> 07:23.641
I met Don Rickles.

07:23.642 --> 07:24.731
Together: No!

07:24.732 --> 07:26.252
Did he say "Don Rickles"?

07:26.253 --> 07:27.539
Maybe we should go in there.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.580
You don't want to go in there. It's boring.

07:29.581 --> 07:31.215
[Laughter]

07:31.216 --> 07:32.650
So, anyway...

07:32.651 --> 07:35.153
I go back in to pick up the steam cleaner.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.155
Rickles thinks I'm the waiter.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.724
So I didn't want to correct Don Rickles,

07:39.725 --> 07:42.160
so I said, "may I take your order, sir?"

07:42.161 --> 07:43.227
And he says...

07:43.228 --> 07:44.762
Oh, you can take my order.

07:44.763 --> 07:47.765
I'll have a large plate
of "shut your trap."

07:47.766 --> 07:49.200
[Laughter]

07:49.201 --> 07:51.069
Wait! What did Rickles say?!

07:51.070 --> 07:52.236
Who cares?

07:52.237 --> 07:53.838
Listen to him going on there.

07:53.839 --> 07:55.273
"Blah, blah, blah."

07:55.274 --> 07:57.275
You have no idea what it's like, Mike.

07:57.276 --> 07:58.777
Oh, I got some idea.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.247
Okay.

08:03.248 --> 08:06.250
I don't know what you
people did to get in here.

08:06.251 --> 08:07.618
I don't want to know.

08:07.619 --> 08:10.488
Bottom line... you're on tink time now.

08:10.489 --> 08:14.489
And that means no smoking,
no texting, no sexting,

08:15.127 --> 08:16.360
no mexting...

08:16.361 --> 08:19.197
Yeah, that's Mexican texting,

08:19.198 --> 08:22.166

16:56.581 --> 16:59.216
that's gonna get you killed
out in the real world!

16:59.217 --> 17:01.118
You got to toughen up, kid! Huh?

17:01.119 --> 17:03.554
Or you're gonna become human mulch!

17:03.555 --> 17:05.289
Have a great day.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.157
- Bup-bup!

Whatevs, lady!

17:14.965 --> 17:16.867
Mike. Mike!

17:16.867 --> 17:19.170
I figured out why they're fighting.

17:19.171 --> 17:20.304
Oh. Good.

17:20.305 --> 17:21.939
I'm glad you woke me up to tell me.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.340
It's 'cause Uncle Dutch
taught me how to ride a bike.

17:24.342 --> 17:26.343
Great story. Night.

17:26.344 --> 17:27.645
No, no, no, no!

17:27.646 --> 17:28.913
It just hit me.

17:28.914 --> 17:29.947
When I was a kid,

17:29.948 --> 17:32.016
my dad could never teach
me how to ride a bike,

17:32.017 --> 17:33.584
and then one day, while he was at work,

17:33.585 --> 17:34.985
Uncle Dutch offered to teach me.

17:34.986 --> 17:38.289
Then my dad came home, and
all hell broke loose.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.490
He was yelling,

17:39.491 --> 17:41.625
"how could you teach my
daughter to ride a bike?!

17:41.626 --> 17:43.561
How could you steal that from me?"

17:43.562 --> 17:46.430
And the next thing I knew,
they were in this huge fight,

17:46.431 --> 17:48.933
and then they just stopped
talking to each other.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.869
You really think this whole
thing is because of a bike?

17:51.870 --> 17:54.939
You wouldn't like it if someone
else taught Sue to ride a bike.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.307
The Donahues taught her.

17:56.308 --> 17:59.477
Look, you can't fix it, Frankie.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.879
You gave it a good shot. Let it be.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.647
And let it be not in our house.

18:03.648 --> 18:05.182
[Sighs]

18:05.183 --> 18:06.450
My heart would break

18:06.451 --> 18:09.887
if Axl and Brick didn't talk
to each other for 25 years.

18:09.888 --> 18:14.024
You got to get along with
your siblings, Mike.

18:14.025 --> 18:15.326
They're your partners for life.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.928
They're the only ones
that have your stories.

18:17.929 --> 18:20.598
I know you really want
these guys to get along

18:20.599 --> 18:23.901
and you're disappointed that
it's not happening, but...

18:23.902 --> 18:25.102
People don't change.
