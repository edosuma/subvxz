Hey, fellas.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.502
Mind signing
this get-well card?

00:36.504 --> 00:38.137
Sure. Who's it for?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.772
It's for me.
You were sick?

00:39.774 --> 00:41.673
Wha...? Yes, I was sick.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.476
I had a temperature of 99.4.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.846
The doctor said, if I
had been born in the 1800s,

00:47.848 --> 00:49.348
it could have been fatal.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.116
Where do you think
I've been all week?

00:51.118 --> 00:53.085
I don't know.
Mustache camp?

00:53.087 --> 00:54.920
That's in June.
You know that.

00:54.922 --> 00:56.588
Oh, sorry, Cleveland.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.190
We... we were just
so, uh, busy

00:58.192 --> 01:00.692
with, uh, Peter Griffin
being in town, you know.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.828
Animation Domination's
Peter Griffin was here?!

01:02.830 --> 01:05.164
Yep. Said when he came down here
for the Beer Walk last year,

01:05.166 --> 01:07.332
he left his daughter,
so Gus had to give her back.

01:07.334 --> 01:10.002
She'd been in the lost and found
box for over a week,

01:10.004 --> 01:11.937
so I figured I could have her.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.272
Peter didn't call you?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.140
No. Did he ask
about me?

01:15.142 --> 01:18.043
Well, he-he spoke generally
about black people.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.345
You know, maybe we should
just leave it at that.

01:20.347 --> 01:21.713
How queer.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.115
Peter's my best friend.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.215
Why would he not call me?

01:24.217 --> 01:25.784
He-he probably just
didn't have the time.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.120
He was only here
for four days.

01:28.122 --> 01:32.191
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be in my sad sack.

01:33.493 --> 01:36.061
(moaning sadly)

01:40.633 --> 01:42.034
Ow.

01:44.003 --> 01:46.605
Roberta, you got something
from Unilab!

01:46.607 --> 01:48.307
Give me that!

01:48.309 --> 01:49.942
Whoo-hoo!

01:49.944 --> 01:52.044
Rallo, you got a letter.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.979
Does it say "Rallo Tubbs"
or "Resident?"

01:53.981 --> 01:55.981
'Cause that bit's
getting pretty tired.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.584
It's from Ms. Gregg,
your old day care teacher.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.918
Cyndi's writing me?

01:59.920 --> 02:01.920
Probably asking for more money.

02:01.922 --> 02:05.090
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.126
Mm-hmm.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.460
I can't read.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.130
"Dear Rallo, you
are cordially invited

02:11.132 --> 02:13.098
"to attend

02:15.035 --> 02:17.136
Reunion already?

02:17.138 --> 02:19.938
Dang, I thought
I'd be a fireman by now.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.274
Maybe I'll just lie
and say I am.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.676
I know I got a hat
around here someplace.

Ooh, Rallo, looks like
you're getting a bath.

02:33.087 --> 02:33.785
Thank God.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.988
I've asked you four
times this week.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.323

Why didn't Peter call
when he was in town?

03:30.277 --> 03:32.311
He and I were BFFs.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.545
Black and fat friends?

03:33.547 --> 03:36.114
Yep. We even
got these tattoos.

I can't.

While you're at it,
name one friend

03:52.700 --> 03:54.366

Can't do it.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.934
Or Lois Griffin's.
Nope.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.469
Francine Smith?
Who?

03:57.471 --> 03:59.204

should be happy

You're right, Donna.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.881

It's called English.

you call me

when you were in
town last week?

07:42.629 --> 07:45.797
Yeah, uh, my phone died...

But I thought
we were friends.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.677
We were neighbors
and drinking buddies.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.145

Wha...? Not friends?

let it go.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.261
Sorry about what happened
with Peter, Cleveland,

08:16.263 --> 08:19.097
but, uh, I can't
say I'm surprised.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.266
I only spent a few days
with the guy, and he...

08:21.268 --> 08:23.034
you know, he's funny and all,
but, man,

08:23.036 --> 08:24.269
what a... what a B-hole.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.937
Agreed.
He's a close sitter.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.606
Lot of leg on leg.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.441
GUS: Also does not
care for the Jews.

08:29.443 --> 08:33.111

back by farting on a pizza.

Very clever.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.784
All true,

08:39.786 --> 08:41.520
but I thought he was my friend.

08:41.522 --> 08:45.156

guys aren't my friends, either.

But I do want us all
to be closer.

08:51.698 --> 08:55.100
Maybe we need to do
something special together.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.968

You are such a douche.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.443
"Male... bonding."

09:05.445 --> 09:07.112
(Cleveland,
Tim and Lester groan)

09:07.114 --> 09:08.613
Man, those guys are cut.

09:08.615 --> 09:09.781
Muscular, too.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.650
Give me that pointless thing.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.785
Oh, here's a friendship camp

09:13.787 --> 09:16.054
sponsored by
"Nature Boy" Ric Flair.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.097
I'm "The Nature Boy" Ric Flair.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.265
Whoo!

09:27.267 --> 09:30.135
Let me tell you,
there are three things I know:

09:30.137 --> 09:33.171
divorce, wrestling
and enduring male friendship.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.140
Whoo!

09:35.142 --> 09:37.175
Now, that is what
a man looks like.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.611
So if you want to be
lifelong friends, join me

09:39.613 --> 09:42.914
on "Nature Boy" Ric Flair's
Male Bonding Nature Trail.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.983
Whoo!

09:44.985 --> 09:46.318
That sounds perfect.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.153
Do you think he'd
come to Stoolbend?

09:48.155 --> 09:49.354
I'm already here.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.789
Whoo!

09:50.791 --> 09:52.624
So how does this work?

09:52.626 --> 09:53.959
Whoo!

09:53.961 --> 09:54.993
A river trip?

09:54.995 --> 09:55.927
Whoo!

09:55.929 --> 09:57.262
To the Stoolbend Springs?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.496
Whoo!

09:58.498 --> 10:00.131
Sorry. Stoolbend
Hot Springs?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.533
Sounds great!

10:01.535 --> 10:03.168
That's one idea.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.970
Here's... here's
another way to go.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.805
Uh, I'm just
spit-balling here,

10:06.807 --> 10:08.773
but how about
we stay here,

10:08.775 --> 10:10.342
drink a bunch
of beers

10:10.344 --> 10:12.577
and leave one by one
without ever really

10:12.579 --> 10:14.512
saying good-bye
to each other?
Yeah.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.114
No. No.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.617
We're in.
We're all in.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.986
Whoo!

10:20.988 --> 10:23.521
I don't want to spend
my Saturday with a tutor.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.424
Why do I need to be in that
stupid Quiz Bowl anyway?

10:26.426 --> 10:28.827
'Cause Mama never got
her mama's approval,

10:28.829 --> 10:31.096
and now she seeks it
from every woman she meets.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.998
Now, get in there!

10:36.669 --> 10:38.770
What's with
the Uggs, Tim?

10:38.772 --> 10:40.271
They said...
they said, "Buy boots."

10:40.273 --> 10:41.439
I don't know.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.475
Where is that Pad-bustin'
son of a bitch?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.510
We had a rule
in grad school.

10:45.512 --> 10:48.246
If the professor was ten
minutes late, we could leave.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.015
You went to grad...

10:50.017 --> 10:53.652
Whoo! Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

10:53.654 --> 10:56.354
Are you guys ready
to be lifelong friends?

10:56.356 --> 10:58.990
Yes, Mr. "Nature Boy"
Ric Flair, we are.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.126
Good. Now, put
on your wigs

11:01.128 --> 11:03.728
and have fun in
your canoooooe!

11:09.502 --> 11:12.504
(birds squawking)

11:12.506 --> 11:14.372
You know what, Cleveland,
you-you were right.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.609
Maybe nature doesn't
suck a huge bag of butt.

11:17.611 --> 11:18.810
This is peace...

11:18.812 --> 11:20.445
Goose! Lice!

11:20.447 --> 11:21.980
All birds have lice!

11:21.982 --> 11:23.214
Hand me the
goose repellent!

11:24.917 --> 11:26.084
(screams)

11:27.186 --> 11:29.020
My tooths!

11:32.525 --> 11:34.526
(gasps)

11:39.265 --> 11:42.167
Help us, Mr. Flippers!

11:47.940 --> 11:49.107
(sighs)

11:49.109 --> 11:51.242
(buzzing)

11:54.013 --> 11:55.814
How was math class, Rallo?

11:55.816 --> 11:57.916
Boring. So we played poker.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.984
I'm 47, never
learned how.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.586
(laughs)

12:01.588 --> 12:04.089
Your son is an
excellent tutor.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.957
That'll be $200
for the hour.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.626
I got this, Mama.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.495
We're still a buck-40 up.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.830
They were gambling?

12:11.832 --> 12:13.031
(chuckles)

12:13.033 --> 12:15.366
I don't know where he would have
learned to play poker.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.935
Oh, yeah,
you don't have any id...

12:16.937 --> 12:18.269
(muffled grunting)

12:18.271 --> 12:21.272
I think I'll be handling
Rallo's tutoring myself.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.508
Donna, I just hope
you're taking this seriously.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.943
Quiz Bowl is not a game.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.978
Well, technically,
it is a game.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.748
Deedee, you took my husband;
is that not enough?

12:29.750 --> 12:32.050
(laughs)

12:33.452 --> 12:35.186
(all panting heavily)

12:37.156 --> 12:40.792
Well, this seems
as good a place as any to die.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.360
Uh, y-you guys
go ahead.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.996
I'm-I'm going to sit
with Holt until he dies

12:44.998 --> 12:46.965
so I can,
you know, eat him.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.168
(whispers): Don't worry,
I'll eat them, too.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.670
You're just the
amuse-bouche.

12:52.672 --> 12:53.972
Listen to me.

12:53.974 --> 12:57.575
Who needs food when we have
our friendship to sustain us?

12:57.577 --> 12:59.811
Yeah, well, sustain this,

12:59.813 --> 13:02.580
he said, too tired
to grab his wang.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.983
Just because your fat friend
didn't call you,

13:04.985 --> 13:06.284
we're gonna die in the woods.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.919
You're on your own.

13:07.921 --> 13:08.987
Come on, snack pack.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.188
Oh.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.691
Nobody's going nowhere.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.627
Oh, thank
God, a local!

13:15.629 --> 13:17.829
We found these
by the river.

13:17.831 --> 13:18.930
Our wigs!

13:18.932 --> 13:20.698
Put them on.

13:20.700 --> 13:25.203
Now, which one of you
wants to be my first girlfriend?

13:25.205 --> 13:26.371
What'd he say?

13:29.775 --> 13:30.842
(hoots)

13:32.745 --> 13:34.646
Okay, Cleveland,
here's the plan.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.981
Since you're the one
who got us into this,

13:36.983 --> 13:38.583
you pull down your pants,

13:38.585 --> 13:40.985
and while they're taking turns
with you, we'll run away.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.086
That's fair.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.354
Wait a minute.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.356
That's what they meant
by "girlfriend"?!

13:45.358 --> 13:48.126
I thought we were gonna wear
their lettermen jackets!

13:48.128 --> 13:49.828
Run!

13:49.830 --> 13:51.129
Out of my way.

13:51.131 --> 13:51.963
Dude, run much?

13:51.965 --> 13:54.365
What a, uh, cluster cluck.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.467
One of them got away.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.468
Which one?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.037
The one in the
yellow shirt.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.171
Huh?

14:00.173 --> 14:03.575
You know, th-the guy
with the moustache.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.109
He's right here.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.145
No, the heavyset...

14:07.147 --> 14:09.414
(quietly):
The black gentleman.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.648
Ho, ho!

14:10.650 --> 14:12.083
Let's leave
race out of it.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.118
Leave rape out of it?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.087
No, no, I said "race."

14:16.089 --> 14:17.088
(laughs)

14:17.090 --> 14:19.657
Can you imagine
if we left rape out of it?

14:19.659 --> 14:20.959
(laughter)

14:20.961 --> 14:21.926
(laughing)

14:21.928 --> 14:23.528
Classic.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.029
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.097
That was so scary.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.131
A little pee came out.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.700
But it's not that noticeable.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.502
If you just glanced at it, you
might think I spilled a soda.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.004
Everyone okay?

14:33.006 --> 14:35.540
Guys? Guys?

14:35.542 --> 14:36.541
Oh, no!

14:36.543 --> 14:38.109
The rednecks got them!

14:38.111 --> 14:39.344
Oh, their bottoms.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.980
Their poor, poor bottoms.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.314
Oh, okay, think.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.916
Congratulations,
Cleveland.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.918
Whoo!

14:46.920 --> 14:48.019
I made it!

14:48.021 --> 14:49.487
I completed the
Friendship Adventure!

14:49.489 --> 14:50.955
Hooray!

14:50.957 --> 14:53.091
But there's no time for this
right now.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.026
I have to save my--
oh, lower back.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.027
(groans)

14:56.029 --> 14:57.996
You got massage
tables here?

14:58.998 --> 15:00.164
A little lower.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.633
Oh, there you go.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.101
Oh, yeah.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.137
No one's ever saved their
friends with a tight lower back.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.139
Could you spend the last
ten minutes on the feet?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.140
Cleveland.
Right!

15:09.142 --> 15:10.341
I'm off to save my friends.

15:13.612 --> 15:15.046
Cucumber water.

15:19.184 --> 15:22.921
So, uh, Lester, w-what, uh,
what can we expect from this?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.421
(mumbles):
I don't know.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.492
I'm not usually on the Ned
Beatty side of this situation.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.995
Best I can guess is
ouchie in the boom-boom.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.765
(whispering):
Guys, it's me.

15:33.767 --> 15:34.999
I've come back
to save you.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.634
Cleveland, thank God you're--

15:36.636 --> 15:38.136
Wow, look at your skin.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.103
You're radiant.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.838
Yeah, you look
really relaxed.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.007
Well, a seaweed wrap
will do that for you.

15:43.009 --> 15:45.910
You know, you guys should take
better care of yourselves.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.913
Well, I'm not sure you picked
the best scenario

15:48.915 --> 15:51.015
to walk in
looking your most attractive.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.417
(shotgun pumps)

15:52.419 --> 15:57.221
You can't do anything to me I
haven't already done to myself.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.461
♪ Quiz Bowl today,
Quiz Bowl today ♪

16:03.463 --> 16:05.997
♪ That's what the sign
said, Quiz Bowl today. ♪

16:06.966 --> 16:09.901
He's got what
Radio had.

16:13.038 --> 16:16.074
Greetings, you big bunch
of query fans.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.676
I'm Wally Farquhar,
the Bowlmaster.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.179
Not to be confused
with the toilet cleanser

16:21.181 --> 16:22.814
of the same name.

16:22.816 --> 16:26.084
Our first category today
is Ornithology.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.152
Stoolbend goes first.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.422
Kyle, name the bird
that makes this call.

16:31.424 --> 16:35.493
(does long, elaborate birdcall)

16:35.495 --> 16:37.695
The sulphur-crested cockatoo.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.098
Correct-a-roonie-o!

16:40.100 --> 16:41.432
You see that, Donna?

16:41.434 --> 16:43.167
That reflects on me!

16:44.303 --> 16:46.437
I bet Wally's seen
a cockatoo.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.505
(chuckles)

16:47.507 --> 16:49.907
Goochland
Science is next.

16:49.909 --> 16:53.077
The topic: Napoleonic
Cryptography.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.245
Who deciphered...?

16:54.247 --> 16:55.480
Sir George Scovell.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.914
Sir right!

16:56.916 --> 16:58.082
(cheering)

16:58.084 --> 17:01.419
Next one goes
to Rallo of Stoolbend.

17:03.789 --> 17:07.759
Rallo, your topic is
Boobies and Wieners.

17:07.761 --> 17:09.594
Yes! I got this.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.596
I'm sorry, I read that wrong.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.665
It's 17th Century
European Metalworking.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.600
What?

17:15.602 --> 17:16.934
The question is:

17:16.936 --> 17:21.139
Name the metalworking process
practiced by Sir Basil Brooke

17:21.141 --> 17:23.441
at the Coalbrookdale ironworks
in Shropshire.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.910
Oh, why don't you
just give it to him!

17:25.912 --> 17:28.780
Uh... uh...

17:28.782 --> 17:29.814
He's gonna blow it.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.382
He's not ready
for this.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.756
You don't
know, do you?

17:38.758 --> 17:40.091
(growls):
You're right!

17:40.093 --> 17:41.125
I don't know!

17:41.127 --> 17:42.160
(crowd gasps)

17:42.162 --> 17:44.429
But I'll tell you
what I do know.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.298
I know how to change the tire
on my Big Wheel,

17:47.300 --> 17:50.668
how to tip a host to get a table
by the skee ball.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.805
I know you don't ask a man
what he makes in allowance.

17:53.807 --> 17:56.240
I know never to
buy property in Detroit.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.477
I can take a punch
and I can throw a punch.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.946
I know never to bet
on the Golden State Warriors,

18:01.948 --> 18:04.615
'cause they don't
play no defense.

18:04.617 --> 18:08.219
And most important,
I know how to treat a lady.

18:09.488 --> 18:10.988
Do you, Wally?

18:10.990 --> 18:12.323
I know menstruating women

18:12.325 --> 18:14.659
cause fruits and vegetables
to spoil.

18:14.661 --> 18:15.660
Damn, Wally.

18:15.662 --> 18:16.961
What's wrong
with you?

18:16.963 --> 18:19.197
Look, Mama, I'm sorry.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.934
I'm not one of these kids
and I'm never gonna be.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.269
You know, it probably
was my fault, too,

18:25.271 --> 18:26.771
for pushing
you too hard.

18:26.773 --> 18:27.839
That's all right.

18:27.841 --> 18:28.906
Let's go home.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.408
I'll make you a dry martini.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.310
Mmm, you do make 'em dry.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.245
Y'all's a bunch of bitches.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.147
Later, nerds.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.357
Guys, I'm sorry I wanted
to be friends with you.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.926
Male friendship
is not about emotions.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.262
I get that now
and feel nothing about it.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.330
(door thumps)

18:52.931 --> 18:55.099
You're up.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.802
The, uh, curlier-haired
individual.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.337
You're making
it worse.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.938
Can we at least
have a drink

19:00.940 --> 19:02.640
and get to know
each other a little?

19:02.642 --> 19:03.808
I'll go first.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.943
I'm an Aries,
and I ate a bunch of glass

19:05.945 --> 19:07.111
that's about to come out.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.112
Now you go.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.113
(grunts)

19:09.115 --> 19:10.948
But-but you don't want me.

19:10.950 --> 19:11.983
I'm frigid!

19:11.985 --> 19:13.751
I'm just gonna lie there!

19:13.753 --> 19:16.120
I kiss like a cat!

19:16.122 --> 19:17.288
Peter!

19:17.290 --> 19:19.690
Leggo my Neggro.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.293
Looks like
it's four against one.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.529
Four against two.

19:25.764 --> 19:27.098
Thanks for your help, Monkey.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.933
Rip their faces and nuts off.

19:28.935 --> 19:32.170
(screeching)

19:32.172 --> 19:33.838
Thanks, Peter.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.306
How did you know
we were here?

19:35.308 --> 19:38.142
Well, I felt bad after you left
Quahog, so I called your house.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.778
Your wife said you were doing
a friendship thing in the woods,

19:40.780 --> 19:42.947
and I immediately thought,
well, this is going to end

19:42.949 --> 19:45.349
in hillbilly rape, so I tracked
you down and here I am.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.586
But I thought you didn't want
to be my friend anymore.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.022
Well, as soon as you left,
I started really intense

19:51.024 --> 19:53.024
psychotherapy with
that gay guy in town

19:53.026 --> 19:54.492
who has, like,
a thousand jobs.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.194
They once said his
name was Bruce.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.696
Right. So, apparently,
I have abandonment issues

19:58.698 --> 20:00.798
stemming from my relationship
with my father,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.133
blah, blah, blah,
ticking time bomb,

20:02.135 --> 20:04.535
so I pushed you away
before you could do it to me.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.170
But I would never do that.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.239
We're BFFs.

20:14.746 --> 20:17.782
(both laugh, sigh)

20:17.784 --> 20:19.083
I'm sorry, Cleveland.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.284
You're my friend.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.019
You always have been.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.421
And I know...

20:24.623 --> 20:29.360
deep down in my heart,
I still love you.

20:31.330 --> 20:35.399
(sobbing loudly)

20:41.974 --> 20:43.074
See, Cleveland,
that's the difference

20:43.076 --> 20:44.242
between our two shows.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.577
On our show, we would have
shown the rape

20:46.579 --> 20:48.279
and had a show tune
about the rape.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.581
And I would have just
been the black guy.
