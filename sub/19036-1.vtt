WEBVTT

02:25.678 --> 02:27.646
"Magazine hill",
they call this place.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.384
Dead end.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.452
Mmm.

02:35.388 --> 02:37.222
Why would labuschagne
and the other men

02:37.224 --> 02:39.625
in the minibus
have come up here?

02:39.627 --> 02:42.294
He claims
he can't remember any of it.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.639
So, Leon's bakkie
was parked here.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.575
He left the keys
in the ignition,
then he ran that way.

02:57.644 --> 03:01.647
The minibus taxi
belonging to
the football team was...

03:01.649 --> 03:04.183
Came to rest here.

03:04.717 --> 03:06.285
Point-blank range.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.820
The gun they found
was registered in Leon's name.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.623
He dragged
the bodies over there,
then he lined them up.

03:13.693 --> 03:17.629
Wait. He lined the bodies up?
Why would he do that?

03:23.937 --> 03:25.971
None of it makes any sense.

03:27.440 --> 03:27.439
Oh.

03:27.441 --> 03:32.611
You can see
the prison from over here,
where he worked.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.549
Who's the judge?

03:37.551 --> 03:39.484
Van zyl, the hanging judge.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.288
The two of you should get on
like chalk and cheese.

03:44.757 --> 03:47.326
Do you think
the state should kill people?

03:48.928 --> 03:51.897
Majority support
the death penalty.

03:51.899 --> 03:56.001
The majority
supported
burning at the stake,

03:56.003 --> 03:58.804
witch dunking, crucifixion.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.831
Sit!

04:33.873 --> 04:36.742
Leon, this is John weber.

04:36.744 --> 04:40.779
He's a senior advocate.
He's been asked to defend you.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.616
I've been asked to,
but I don't
particularly want to.

04:48.554 --> 04:51.323
Then why don't you go home?

04:52.659 --> 04:55.827
Because your case is so bad,
no one else will take it.

05:00.600 --> 05:05.037
I already told you,
i don't want you to defend me.

05:06.439 --> 05:07.973
I don't want to talk.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.744
I don't want to
see you, either.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.050
Well, we've
fulfilled our obligations.
Let's go.

05:18.052 --> 05:20.552
Hang on.
I've had enough of this cock.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.754
I've spent a shitload of time
working on this case!

05:22.756 --> 05:25.090
Listen to me, Leon.
You might be feeling
sorry for yourself now,

05:25.092 --> 05:27.826
but you're gonna feel
a hell of a lot worse
when you get a death sentence.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.862
I met your wife,
your little daughter, Esme.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.031
When you last see her?
Six months ago?

05:39.906 --> 05:44.609
I read in your file that
you were a warder in
the prison service.

05:44.611 --> 05:47.946
I suggest you find out
what's in store for you.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.449
Speak to the warders
when you go back to your cell,

05:50.451 --> 05:52.584
ask them what
happens on death row.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.923
I know what
happens on death row.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.692
I worked there.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.365
When this happened,
you were working

06:06.367 --> 06:08.400
on death row at
maximum security prison?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.436
Surely, you were too young.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.507
I started working
there over two years ago.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.810
On gallows duty?

06:23.983 --> 06:25.884
Leave me alone.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.457
Nobody gets away
with killing seven people.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.993
Unless they're the police,
of course.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.161
Bad break, my boy.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.630
There's no defense
for an attack like that.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.500
No, the guy's as good as dead.

06:41.502 --> 06:41.500
Good serve, Andrew!

06:41.502 --> 06:47.038
Paul, stand further back,
you get a better
chance to get to the ball!

06:47.040 --> 06:51.076
Look at it this way, John.
Everyone gets a bad
case now and then.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.412
You just got a hopeless one.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.616
With soldiers who
return from combat,

06:57.618 --> 06:59.818
a minority suffer
mental breakdown

06:59.820 --> 07:02.587
after one
traumatic experience.

07:02.589 --> 07:06.892
But only a very small minority
avoid breakdown
after prolonged exposure.

07:07.994 --> 07:11.630
Which is what
this would have been.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.800
In fact,
he reminds me of
veterans I've treated.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.002
I'd say he's in
a similar state
of emotional collapse.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.171
So, what you're saying,
as far as
the prosecution is concerned,

07:19.173 --> 07:21.573
is that your tests
don't prove mental breakdown,

07:21.575 --> 07:22.974
but also don't rule
out the possibility

07:22.976 --> 07:25.010
that he could be
a racist or a psychopath.

07:25.012 --> 07:28.747
My opinion?
Something triggered
a violent response.

07:29.715 --> 07:33.151
Any idea what that
trigger might be?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.586
I'm afraid not.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.721
So, it follows, Dr.
schlebusch,

07:36.723 --> 07:38.857
that there might
actually not be a trigger.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.793
That's correct.

08:06.719 --> 08:06.718
<i> The trial of Leon labuschagne,</i>

08:06.720 --> 08:11.590
<i> the man who shot</i>
<i> dead seven members</i>
<i> of a mamaloni football club,</i>

08:11.592 --> 08:14.259
<i> starts in the pretoria</i>
<i> high court this week.</i>

08:14.261 --> 08:17.662
<i> Human rights advocate,</i>
<i> John weber,</i>
<i> who's defending labuschagne,</i>

08:17.664 --> 08:21.733
<i> is well known internationally</i>
<i> as an opponent of</i>
<i> capital punishment.</i>

08:21.735 --> 08:21.733
<i> According to police sources,</i>

08:21.735 --> 08:25.871
<i> labuschagne's</i>
<i> motives for the shooting</i>
<i> are unclear,</i>

08:25.873 --> 08:29.975
<i> and any links to</i>
<i> right wing organizations</i>
<i> is pure speculation.</i>

08:29.977 --> 08:32.143
<i> To date,</i>
<i> labuschagne has refused</i>

08:32.145 --> 08:33.945
<i> to make a statement.</i>

08:35.515 --> 08:37.616
We won't have
many chances, Leon.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.049
Once you're in
the witness box,

08:39.052 --> 08:40.885
we'll be prohibited
from speaking to you

08:40.888 --> 08:42.687
until you finish
giving evidence.

08:42.688 --> 08:42.687
So, you've gotta
help us now, man.

08:42.688 --> 08:47.158
Just give us a reason
for why things
happened the way they did.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.571
There you have it.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.006
He's been briefed
on how to respond

09:01.008 --> 09:02.574
to the judge
and the prosecutor

09:02.576 --> 09:05.010
and how to
answer our questions.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.878
I don't know
what else I can do.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.020
Stand up!

09:15.022 --> 09:19.190
Hold it!
Labuschagne, look at this.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.028
Mr. wierda obtained this
register from
the prisons department.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.931
It lists
the names of all the men
hanged last year.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.667
You must've participated
in some of these executions.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.669
All of them.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.272
Repeat that?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.207
I was at all the executions.

09:37.843 --> 09:41.179
According to this list,
164 men were
executed last year.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.682
A record number.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.684
If that's what it says.

09:47.787 --> 09:51.856
Why were you present
at every execution?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.604
Pierre.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.105
Aye, John.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.773
How is it?
Good.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.378
Uh, could you let
me sit this side?
If you don't mind.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.246
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.389
So, how's my sister?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.191
Surprised to
hear you're in town.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.361
So, what's this business
you wanna discuss?

10:31.697 --> 10:33.231
Pierre, um,

10:34.734 --> 10:38.069
what do you know about the men
who work on death row?

10:39.138 --> 10:39.137
Not much.

10:42.408 --> 10:45.176
Well, I happen to know
that they take
part in executions,

10:45.178 --> 10:50.649
but what I don't know is,
what kind of person does that?

10:50.651 --> 10:53.385
What makes
someone take on the job
of killing someone?

10:55.287 --> 10:57.856
John, I can't talk about that.
You should know that by now.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.291
I don't mean you.
This is a boy they put

11:00.293 --> 11:03.962
on gallows duty at 17,
for god's sake.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.831
And you get another shot
at the evil system
you hate so much, eh?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.735
Pierre,
they threw this boy into hell

11:10.737 --> 11:13.905
and he went out
and shot seven men.

11:13.907 --> 11:18.309
Now, he won't,
or can't speak
a word to defend himself.

11:19.779 --> 11:23.415
You have contacts
inside the prison system.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.116
They'll talk to you.

11:27.319 --> 11:30.755
All right,
I'll make some inquiries,
but you're wasting your time.

11:30.757 --> 11:33.958
'Cause the guys
who do what he does,
they don't talk about it.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.360
They never do.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.395
You should tell him
to keep his head up.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.064
It's the victims' families,
they staring at him.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.405
That's his parents,
his sister antoinette.

12:40.392 --> 12:45.797
At about 18:00,
on a deserted road
near the magazine hill quarry,

12:45.799 --> 12:47.866
the accused forced
the minibus in which

12:47.868 --> 12:50.001
the deceased were
traveling from the road,

12:50.003 --> 12:53.471
then shot all seven
victims with a pistol.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.279
Detective,
is this pistol, which is

13:01.281 --> 13:03.148
registered in
the name of the accused,

13:03.150 --> 13:06.217
the firearm that was used
to fire the bullets
found at the scene?

13:08.455 --> 13:10.088
This is the pistol, m'lord.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.925
That's all I have for
this witness, my lord.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.094
Mr. weber?

13:18.564 --> 13:20.098
No questions, my lord.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.470
What are you doing?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.971
I'll explain later.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.342
The bakkie found
parked next to the body,

13:31.344 --> 13:34.012
that too was registered
in the name of the accused?

13:34.014 --> 13:36.014
Yes.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.883
According to your report,
the vehicle would not start.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.885
Correct.
He was forced to flee on foot.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.221
That's all, my lord.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.895
No questions, my lord.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.330
Why didn't you
cross-examine anyone?

13:52.332 --> 13:53.932
We can't argue facts.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.334
If we admit everything,
we deny them the opportunity

13:56.336 --> 13:58.169
for a parade of
emotional witnesses,

13:58.171 --> 14:00.004
and rob
the case of its impact.

14:00.006 --> 14:03.208
So, after a couple of days,
they'll have nothing left.

14:03.210 --> 14:07.378
They found him,
they found the gun,
they found the bakkie.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.047
That's all they've got.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.448
That's all?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.483
What have we got?
Leon is nearly comatose,

14:12.485 --> 14:14.385
Dr. schlebusch will
barely speak to him...

14:14.387 --> 14:16.187
If it goes that way tomorrow,
gentlemen,

14:16.189 --> 14:17.922
we'll soon be
finished on our side.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.257
Good night.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.192
Good night.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.895
And you were going to say,

14:23.897 --> 14:28.299
a senior advocate
who hasn't handled
a murder case in 15 years?

14:34.240 --> 14:36.241
I don't know
what you said
to him last time,

14:36.243 --> 14:38.409
but he was grouchy
when he came home.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.579
More than usual?

14:41.581 --> 14:44.249
I'm the one who has
to live with him, John.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.351
Here, take that.

14:52.324 --> 14:54.959
Seems to me he's
guilty of murder

14:54.961 --> 14:58.029
and you're trying to turn it
into a political case.

14:58.031 --> 15:01.599
Well, every case involving
the death sentence
is a political case.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.402
Could've just been road rage,
you ever think of that?

15:06.205 --> 15:08.640
He shot seven people 13 times.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.510
A very bad case of road rage.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.047
The only thing I've
accomplished so far

15:16.049 --> 15:17.548
is to keep our
strategy a secret,

15:17.550 --> 15:19.651
but that ends when
the defense starts.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.923
Well,
see if this is of any use.

15:25.291 --> 15:25.290
What is it?

15:25.292 --> 15:29.627
It's a table of drops.
How much do you weigh?

15:30.229 --> 15:32.530
About 70 kilos.

15:33.332 --> 15:37.168
So, you divide 840 foot-pounds

15:37.170 --> 15:39.537
by the weight of the prisoner,
in this case 70,

15:39.539 --> 15:41.639
which means that you,
John weber,

15:41.641 --> 15:44.142
would need five feet,
three inches of rope

15:44.144 --> 15:47.445
for a nice,
clean break.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.380
He was very good
at it, apparently.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.316
They relied on him,
calculating the drops.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.988
And how do you know this?

16:00.225 --> 16:01.592
You don't wanna ask.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.296
What else, Pierre?

16:08.167 --> 16:11.669
What struck me is
that these warders,

16:11.671 --> 16:14.672
they get to know the men
that they have to hang.

16:14.674 --> 16:18.476
They're their caretakers,
then they haul them out,
string them up.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.312
And this struck you, why?

16:23.182 --> 16:27.452
In a war,
you don't see
the enemy as people.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.655
You're shooting at uniforms,
not men.

16:32.424 --> 16:37.295
The only thing worse
than killing a stranger
is killing someone you know.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.768
Strangers are hard enough.

16:49.408 --> 16:51.576
You have to go
through all of these?

16:51.578 --> 16:55.246
Yes, these 32 men
who were hanged in
the last two weeks

16:55.248 --> 16:57.115
Leon was there.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.684
And what are we
looking for exactly?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.620
It might be useful
to find out something
about the men he hanged

17:02.622 --> 17:05.423
in the days
before the shooting.

17:05.425 --> 17:10.228
He developed a very
close relationship
with these men.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.630
How would you know that?

17:12.632 --> 17:17.335
My brother-in-law has contacts
in the prison system.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.603
He's a warder?

17:21.673 --> 17:27.145
Intelligence. Special forces.
He spent three years
fighting in Angola.

17:28.247 --> 17:31.082
What's that got to do
with anything, John?

17:31.084 --> 17:33.418
Well, for one thing,
it means he knows

17:33.420 --> 17:35.720
first-hand what
killing does to a person.

17:37.256 --> 17:40.358
I'm sorry,
are we assembling evidence

17:40.360 --> 17:43.628
to support your
political pre-conception
about capital punishment,

17:43.630 --> 17:46.297
or are we trying to discover
the extenuating circumstances

17:46.299 --> 17:49.067
that might save Leon
from a death sentence?

17:50.670 --> 17:55.406
Something must have happened
to labuschagne toward the end.

17:55.408 --> 17:59.710
These men all had
reasons for killing.
He must've had a reason.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.213
We need to find
out what it is.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.849
So, we're down to
wild hunches, then.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.818
Look,
i understand that a defense

18:06.820 --> 18:08.753
based on complete
mental breakdown

18:08.755 --> 18:11.322
doesn't succeed very often.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.524
But it's all we've
got at this stage.

18:15.461 --> 18:17.328
Unless you have a better idea.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.301
Do you have a better idea?

18:25.737 --> 18:27.538
No.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.156
Um...

19:21.193 --> 19:26.364
If it pleases my lord
and my lord's
learned assessors.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.899
Yes, yes, carry on.

19:29.201 --> 19:32.203
This is an extraordinary case

19:32.205 --> 19:36.674
in which the evidence
for the prosecution
is undisputed

19:36.676 --> 19:38.876
and the case for
the prosecution is,

19:38.878 --> 19:41.245
in a way, also
the case for the defense.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.749
On a murder charge,
the prosecution has to prove

19:44.751 --> 19:49.687
that the act was
both unlawful and intentional.

19:49.689 --> 19:53.191
We intend to prove
that there was no act

19:53.193 --> 19:56.527
to which the law attaches
legal consequences.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.897
Are you
suggesting there was no act
when we have seven bodies?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.899
My lord is
entitled to be skeptical.

20:01.901 --> 20:06.437
The prosecution
has been at pains
to explain what has happened.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.906
We intend to explain
why these events happened

20:08.908 --> 20:12.777
and whether the accused
can be held
criminally responsible.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.779
Well,
you'd better explain

20:14.781 --> 20:16.747
very carefully
what the defense is,

20:16.749 --> 20:18.749
as I'm at
a loss to understand.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.787
How can you say
there was no act

20:22.789 --> 20:25.523
when you've admitted that
the accused killed
the seven deceased?

20:25.525 --> 20:27.625
With respect,
my lord, the events

20:27.627 --> 20:30.761
at the quarry
are not in dispute,

20:30.763 --> 20:33.364
but the brutality,
the scale of the events,

20:33.366 --> 20:36.367
seven fit young men
killed by a single individual

20:36.369 --> 20:38.903
calls for closer scrutiny.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.706
The prosecution has adduced
no evidence of a motive,

20:41.708 --> 20:43.441
and there appears to be none.

20:43.443 --> 20:47.378
We intend to look
at the accused's
working conditions

20:47.380 --> 20:50.581
on death row,
inside maximum
security prison,

20:50.583 --> 20:52.617
and the events
that took place there

20:52.619 --> 20:54.518
prior to
the incidents at the quarry

20:54.520 --> 20:57.388
in order to find
the reason for his actions.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.291
Actions we believe

21:00.559 --> 21:02.627
were unconscious

21:02.629 --> 21:06.631
and triggered by
his traumatic
experiences as a warder.

21:13.405 --> 21:14.772
So,

21:15.774 --> 21:18.376
the defense is asserting

21:18.378 --> 21:22.046
that the accused's
working conditions
triggered these actions,

21:22.048 --> 21:26.450
that they were involuntary,
and therefore not
punishable by law.

21:27.352 --> 21:28.819
Correct, my lord.

21:33.659 --> 21:36.761
This raises
matters of state security, Mr.
weber.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.770
If I allow this,
i don't want any names used.

21:46.872 --> 21:50.408
Not of officials or inmates.
Not one.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.811
Listen, labuschagne,

22:26.813 --> 22:32.583
when you're on the stand,
you'll talk,
you'll do as you're told,

22:32.585 --> 22:35.853
or you'll soon find yourself
back in your gallows

22:35.855 --> 22:37.888
with a noose
around your own neck.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.765
Mr. labuschagne,
please tell
the court how old you were

22:47.767 --> 22:50.067
when you first
joined the prison service.

22:57.409 --> 22:58.642
17.

22:59.144 --> 23:01.779
And why did you join?

23:01.781 --> 23:04.148
If you join
the police or prisons,

23:04.150 --> 23:06.717
you don't have
to go to the army.

23:07.986 --> 23:10.721
Why did you wish to
avoid the military?

23:12.657 --> 23:15.559
They sent you to
Angola to fight.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.565
Were you aware
that the warders
at maximum security prison

23:21.567 --> 23:22.767
performed gallows duties?

23:25.070 --> 23:27.405
No.

23:27.407 --> 23:30.474
So, you had no idea
what your duties would be

23:30.476 --> 23:32.042
when you first
arrived at maximum.

23:34.012 --> 23:36.113
No.

23:36.115 --> 23:39.483
Could you tell the court
about your first day there?

23:40.452 --> 23:43.921
I was briefed on
the importance of secrecy.

23:45.056 --> 23:48.726
I was told not
to speak to anyone

23:48.728 --> 23:51.061
about anything to
do with the work

23:51.063 --> 23:53.531
we were doing
inside the prison.

23:54.966 --> 23:58.769
And if I did,
I'd be disciplined.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.674
My lord,
is this detail necessary?

24:03.676 --> 24:07.011
We are here to shed light
on what occurred
on magazine hill,

24:07.013 --> 24:10.214
not to make public
the internal functions
of a government institution

24:10.216 --> 24:14.018
whose activities
might be confidential,
perhaps even secret.

24:17.456 --> 24:21.091
My lord, the time
the accused spent
working on death row

24:21.093 --> 24:24.528
is central to
the defense's case
regarding his state of mind

24:24.530 --> 24:27.097
that day on magazine hill.

24:27.099 --> 24:30.534
We intend to lead
detailed testimony

24:30.536 --> 24:33.504
about
the accused's state of mind,

24:33.506 --> 24:36.140
in particular,
his circumstances at work.

24:41.947 --> 24:45.182
I'll allow it, Mr.
weber, provisionally.

24:47.953 --> 24:47.952
Continue, please.

24:47.954 --> 24:53.691
What did you
experience on your first day
at maximum, Mr. labuschagne?

25:06.571 --> 25:10.040
I was to accompany
the warrant officer

25:10.042 --> 25:11.709
to see seven men on the rope.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.177
"On the rope?"

25:16.214 --> 25:19.817
<i> It's what we</i>
<i> say for any prisoner</i>
<i> under the death sentence.</i>

25:22.854 --> 25:27.992
<i> These seven were</i>
<i> going up the next day</i>
<i> to the gallows.</i>

25:35.133 --> 25:37.968
Will you please tell the court

25:37.970 --> 25:40.304
what happened
when you went
to see these men?

25:45.744 --> 25:50.314
The warrant officer said
I'd have to pick one

25:50.316 --> 25:54.818
as I'd have to
escort one of the men
to be hanged the next day.

25:56.821 --> 25:59.089
So, you were told
you were gonna help

25:59.091 --> 26:01.325
hang one of these
men the very next day.

26:05.196 --> 26:09.567
Sir, I'd rather you
picked one for me, sir.

26:09.569 --> 26:13.037
The new boy must pick one.
That's how it works.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.646
Hmm?

26:29.154 --> 26:31.121
Makhandla.

26:32.057 --> 26:33.857
Pick makhandla.

26:39.164 --> 26:40.998
What's his name?

26:43.368 --> 26:45.235
What's his name?
Makhandla!

26:48.974 --> 26:50.674
Did the warrant
officer tell you

26:50.676 --> 26:52.176
what you were to
do the next day

26:52.178 --> 26:54.278
as an escort at a hanging?

26:56.781 --> 27:01.118
Just said to learn by
following and watching others.

27:03.221 --> 27:05.723
That was your first day?

27:06.091 --> 27:07.625
Yes.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.162
Tell the court what happened
on your second day.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.642
<i> Executions are at 7:00 A.M.</i>

27:27.846 --> 27:29.947
<i> We came for them at 6:00.</i>

28:49.260 --> 28:50.794
Come on.

29:17.021 --> 29:18.355
Come.

29:23.828 --> 29:25.763
<i> Were there any problems?</i>

29:29.400 --> 29:32.035
Were there any problems,
Mr. labuschagne?

29:36.508 --> 29:38.108
No.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.812
Everyone just does
what they're told, do they?

29:43.114 --> 29:46.083
<i> They're taught to obey.</i>

29:47.452 --> 29:49.920
What happens if
they don't obey?

30:11.042 --> 30:12.142
Come on.

30:40.972 --> 30:42.406
Do you have anything to say

30:42.408 --> 30:45.976
before the order of
the court is carried out?

30:45.978 --> 30:50.314
Do you have anything to say
before the order of
the court is carried out?

30:50.316 --> 30:54.451
Do you have anything to say
before the order of
the court is carried out?

30:54.453 --> 30:58.155
Do you have anything to say
before the order of
the court is carried out?

30:58.157 --> 31:01.525
Do you have anything to say
before the order of
the court is carried out?

31:01.527 --> 31:05.629
Do you have anything to say
before the order of
the court is carried out?

31:52.977 --> 31:56.480
<i> I didn't</i>
<i> wanna look at the rope,</i>
<i> but I could smell it.</i>

31:57.982 --> 32:01.318
<i> It was like a wet doormat.</i>

32:09.427 --> 32:11.061
A sound was in my ears,

32:12.931 --> 32:14.331
like water.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.405
I could feel my arm shaking,

32:22.674 --> 32:26.543
but I didn't know
if it was from me
or from the prisoner.

32:37.956 --> 32:42.192
Tell us in your own words
what you observed.

32:50.535 --> 32:53.103
Mr. labuschagne,
the court is waiting.

32:54.672 --> 32:57.607
Tell us what you
remember from that day.

33:00.378 --> 33:01.611
The noise.

33:03.448 --> 33:05.716
What did you see?

34:19.056 --> 34:21.224
Don't hold on so
tight next time,

34:22.226 --> 34:24.628
or he'll pull
you down with him.

34:24.630 --> 34:27.230
Then you'll look
like a puss, won't you?

34:43.246 --> 34:45.614
Did the warrant officer
say anything to
you after this?

34:47.618 --> 34:51.088
I was told
not to talk about the hanging,

34:51.556 --> 34:54.458
any hanging, to anyone.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.698
Did he say anything else?

35:01.700 --> 35:04.668
That I would
be doing this job

35:04.670 --> 35:07.737
two or three
times every two weeks.

35:09.841 --> 35:13.310
Two or three
times every two weeks.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.513
Did he offer any advice,
or counseling?

35:18.583 --> 35:20.750
No.

35:20.752 --> 35:24.488
Did he provide any training
for the work you were to do?

35:25.289 --> 35:25.288
No.

35:25.290 --> 35:29.192
Had you been assessed
or screened in any way

35:29.194 --> 35:31.361
to ensure you were
suitable for this job?

35:33.731 --> 35:33.730
No.

35:33.732 --> 35:37.334
Did the warrant
officer give you a choice,

35:37.336 --> 35:39.636
whether you were willing
to do this work, or not?

35:41.572 --> 35:41.571
No.

35:41.573 --> 35:47.677
Remind the court
as to how many days
you'd been working at maximum

35:47.679 --> 35:50.313
when you were called upon
to hang these men.

35:53.684 --> 35:55.352
One.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.621
And you were how old?

35:59.423 --> 36:02.826
I said, I was 17.

36:08.699 --> 36:10.367
Still 17.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.174
Mr. weber.

36:18.442 --> 36:19.509
Um...

36:19.511 --> 36:24.848
Would now be a convenient time
to adjourn, my lord?

36:24.850 --> 36:26.716
The court adjourns.

36:38.496 --> 36:40.263
Mr. weber?

36:40.831 --> 36:42.632
Sorry.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.868
You asked if i
believed Leon when he said

36:44.870 --> 36:47.337
he had no memory
of the shooting.

36:47.339 --> 36:49.306
Memory is
an intellectual function.

36:49.308 --> 36:53.677
When you're completely swamped
by emotion,
the intellect can shut down.

36:53.679 --> 36:56.379
So, memory shuts down, too.

36:56.381 --> 36:59.649
They're upset.
They don't like seeing him
put through the wringer.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.985
They'll like it even less
if he ends up on death row.

37:01.987 --> 37:05.589
You'll have to force Leon
to recollect
things that are painful.

37:05.591 --> 37:08.825
Break him down,
make him cry even.
Then he'll talk.

37:08.827 --> 37:09.960
Hell, that's the problem.

37:09.962 --> 37:11.728
We have no idea
what he'll talk about.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.230
We're plunging
down a dark tunnel

37:13.232 --> 37:13.230
with no idea what's
on the other side.

37:13.232 --> 37:16.833
What's on the other side
may be the reason
why it happened.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.835
And if that reason is
racial or political,

37:18.837 --> 37:20.770
how's it gonna help
him beat the rope?

37:22.473 --> 37:25.275
How can you defend
that man, Mr. weber?

37:26.410 --> 37:30.280
Ma'am, I despise
killing of any kind,

37:30.881 --> 37:32.582
lawful or unlawful.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.851
What about my son?
Thabo mokoena.

37:34.853 --> 37:37.387
Why should he
get away with it?

37:37.389 --> 37:38.688
She is right, sir.

37:41.359 --> 37:43.593
That man must pay
for what he's done!

37:59.877 --> 38:03.480
Look at this one.
"Eben christiaan coetzee."

38:03.482 --> 38:07.484
Same age as Leon.
Had a daughter.
From a good home.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.586
Mild mannered by all accounts.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.755
Participated in
the rape of a black woman

38:11.757 --> 38:13.890
after pressure from
the others involved.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.792
All of whom were older.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.827
Then he snaps,
goes on a rampage,

38:17.829 --> 38:19.829
and takes the lead
in killing the victim.

38:19.831 --> 38:20.997
Why?

38:22.300 --> 38:24.334
I wouldn't know.

38:24.336 --> 38:27.704
Was he trying to
prove something
to the others?

38:27.706 --> 38:30.440
Was that the reason?

38:30.442 --> 38:33.910
We won't ever know. He's dead.
They hanged him.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.347
Yes.

38:37.349 --> 38:40.617
And Leon was his escort.

38:40.619 --> 38:44.521
He specifically requested
Leon be his escort.

38:45.923 --> 38:47.857
Why?

38:47.859 --> 38:49.859
I'm going home, John.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.761
We still have
the case
histories to go through.

38:51.763 --> 38:54.831
No. We're off on
some tangent here.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.767
These profiles,
they're not gonna tell us
anything about Leon,

38:57.769 --> 38:57.767
or why he did what he did.

38:57.769 --> 39:03.873
That woman,
the one who lost her son,
Mrs. mokoena, she's right.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.343
You sit there
wringing your hands
over the death penalty,

39:06.345 --> 39:08.778
studying the case files
of the men who were hanged.

39:08.780 --> 39:12.716
But no one ever
remembers the victims.
Like this guy.

39:14.585 --> 39:18.421
Him and his accomplice
stabbed
the victim numerous times.

39:18.423 --> 39:21.358
No one remembers
that poor man
running for his life.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.727
Or this guy,
this bastard who burned

39:23.729 --> 39:26.596
his victim to death
in the boot of her car.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.998
No one remembers
that poor woman's suffering.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Or any of these women
in any of these cases,

39:31.002 --> 39:33.370
who were raped and
strangled and beaten,

39:33.372 --> 39:35.472
had their heads
bashed in, stabbed,

39:35.474 --> 39:38.441
drowned in their own blood
in the arms of a son!

39:38.443 --> 39:41.010
No one remembers
their suffering.
And who organizes a protest,

39:41.012 --> 39:44.881
or delivers a paper at
an international conference!

39:50.755 --> 39:53.890
The reason is that
these men are animals.

39:54.825 --> 39:56.826
And when there's
a gang involved,

39:56.828 --> 39:58.762
reason goes out
the window altogether.

40:00.464 --> 40:02.699
The only thing
you can do with them

40:02.701 --> 40:04.901
is to get rid
of them for good.

40:09.874 --> 40:11.608
Pedrie, there's...

40:12.476 --> 40:14.778
There's something here.

40:14.780 --> 40:18.648
The relationships
that Leon formed
with the men he hanged

40:18.650 --> 40:21.518
have to had an impact on him.

40:26.824 --> 40:28.892
I need to go, John.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.496
Good night.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.620
Who's that?

41:30.622 --> 41:34.557
If that's who I think it is,
we're in for a rough ride.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.030
Please,
could you inform the court

41:41.032 --> 41:42.899
as to how many
men were executed

41:42.901 --> 41:44.501
in your final year at maximum.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.803
Please consult
the execution register,

41:46.805 --> 41:49.038
which has been
submitted as evidence.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.548
164.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.184
164 hangings
in a single year,

42:01.186 --> 42:03.653
which was a record, I believe.

42:03.655 --> 42:03.653
Yes.

42:03.655 --> 42:06.923
And you were present
when these men were admitted

42:06.925 --> 42:09.792
and you were also present
when they were executed.

42:09.794 --> 42:10.960
Yes.

42:10.962 --> 42:12.662
At all
the executions that year.

42:12.664 --> 42:14.297
Yes.

42:14.299 --> 42:17.567
So, you would've come to know
these people
during their stay,

42:17.569 --> 42:19.836
or should I say,
"your stay at maximum?"

42:20.905 --> 42:22.772
Yes.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.707
How well did you
get to know these men?

42:25.609 --> 42:28.077
We spent all day with them.

42:28.079 --> 42:30.079
So, would you say that,
in some cases,

42:30.081 --> 42:32.682
you developed relationships
with some of these men?

42:36.854 --> 42:41.090
Let's pick
a prisoner at random.

42:41.092 --> 42:43.259
If you look down the list.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.862
Eben christiaan coetzee,
for example.

42:45.864 --> 42:47.931
We object, my lord.
Once again, my learned friend

42:47.933 --> 42:50.900
is straying into matters
which are
deliberately kept confidential

42:50.902 --> 42:54.103
out of respect
for the families
of the executed prisoners.

42:54.105 --> 42:57.807
Yes, Mr. weber. I've asked you
to keep the names out of this.

42:57.809 --> 43:01.678
My lord, we have to use a name
in this instance

43:01.680 --> 43:04.013
as the prisoner,
before he was hanged,

43:04.015 --> 43:07.216
may have developed
a relationship
with the accused.

43:07.218 --> 43:11.921
Further, my lord,
the evidence supplied
and the names thereon

43:11.923 --> 43:16.125
are a matter of public record,
not confidential at all.

43:24.602 --> 43:27.670
I've given
the defense a lot of leeway
in this case,

43:29.073 --> 43:32.375
far more than i
ever imagined I would
in a case like this.

43:33.711 --> 43:36.746
I expect the same solicitude
from the defense in future.

43:39.650 --> 43:42.919
Mr. labuschagne, how well
did you know the prisoner,

43:42.921 --> 43:44.153
eben christiaan coetzee?

43:48.659 --> 43:50.927
I read the Bible to him.

43:50.929 --> 43:53.963
To any prisoner
who requested it.

43:56.100 --> 43:59.836
Eben was 19
years old, correct?

44:01.271 --> 44:01.270
Yes.

44:01.272 --> 44:05.341
Eben had a wife and daughter,
and I believe

44:05.343 --> 44:08.111
you have a daughter,
don't you?

44:08.812 --> 44:10.146
Esme.

44:12.082 --> 44:13.916
You met his wife and daughter.

44:18.322 --> 44:21.024
They came to say
goodbye to him.

44:23.961 --> 44:27.697
I walked them
back to the car park
through the prison garden.

44:29.700 --> 44:32.869
And they thanked me
for looking after him.

44:34.438 --> 44:38.374
You believed
that eben should
have been reprieved?

44:38.376 --> 44:43.212
Other men were reprieved,
so, why shouldn't he
have been reprieved?

44:44.048 --> 44:45.281
Did you tell him?

44:49.753 --> 44:51.454
I would've been dismissed.

44:51.456 --> 44:53.723
By the warrant officer?

44:54.158 --> 44:56.125
Over here.

44:57.762 --> 44:59.028
Order!

45:06.170 --> 45:07.470
Yes.

45:07.472 --> 45:10.039
So, you felt
eben should have
been reprieved,

45:10.041 --> 45:14.243
but instead,
you were his escort
and you helped hang him.

45:16.046 --> 45:17.380
Yes.

45:17.382 --> 45:20.483
What were your
duties as eben's escort?

45:26.056 --> 45:27.490
<i> I measured his weight,</i>

45:28.492 --> 45:30.159
<i> height,</i>

45:30.794 --> 45:30.793
<i> neck.</i>

45:30.795 --> 45:35.998
<i> What was the purpose</i>
<i> of all these measurements?</i>

45:39.970 --> 45:43.072
<i> To calculate</i>
<i> the length of the drop.</i>

45:43.074 --> 45:45.441
<i> The length of rope required</i>

45:45.443 --> 45:47.944
<i> in order to assure</i>
<i> he died instantly.</i>

45:47.946 --> 45:49.746
<i> You were responsible for that.</i>

45:51.348 --> 45:53.149
Yes.

45:54.184 --> 45:58.421
If you calculated
eben's drop incorrectly,

45:58.423 --> 46:01.157
he might not
have died instantly.

46:01.159 --> 46:02.759
He might've suffered.

46:07.164 --> 46:08.431
Yes.

46:10.868 --> 46:14.070
Quite a lot of responsibility,
isn't it?

46:17.207 --> 46:21.310
How long can it
take for a man to die
from strangulation,

46:21.312 --> 46:24.180
hanging there
with his neck broken,

46:24.182 --> 46:27.416
but enough oxygen
to allow
conscious brain activity?

46:37.528 --> 46:42.131
If you left him hanging there,
without hauling
him back up again,

46:43.167 --> 46:45.535
it could take as
long as 15 minutes.

46:48.205 --> 46:50.973
Rather like torture, isn't it?

46:50.975 --> 46:53.075
Mr.
weber, I'm warning you.

46:53.077 --> 46:55.411
This is not
the time nor the place

46:55.413 --> 46:57.880
for a debate on
the death penalty.

46:58.982 --> 47:00.583
As my lord pleases.

47:00.585 --> 47:04.387
Mr. labuschagne,
please tell the court
how you felt personally,

47:04.389 --> 47:06.455
measuring eben's neck,

47:06.457 --> 47:08.591
when you'd gotten
to know him so well

47:08.593 --> 47:10.893
and felt he
should not be hanged.

47:21.238 --> 47:23.072
I didn't feel anything.

47:23.074 --> 47:27.844
What about when you were
on the gallows next to eben,

47:28.946 --> 47:30.513
and the trap door opened?

47:31.481 --> 47:34.217
What went
through your mind then?

47:35.319 --> 47:37.019
I don't know what you mean.

47:37.021 --> 47:40.256
What thoughts
did you experience?

47:42.025 --> 47:43.359
None.

47:43.361 --> 47:45.061
When you met eben
and his little girl,

47:45.063 --> 47:48.064
you were having
problems at home,
weren't you?

47:48.066 --> 47:50.499
Your drinking and fighting
had resulted in a separation

47:50.501 --> 47:54.237
from your wife, magda,
and your own
little girl, Esme.

48:10.220 --> 48:11.554
Mr. labuschagne!

48:11.556 --> 48:11.554
Nothing!

48:11.556 --> 48:18.561
I felt nothing.
I thought nothing.
I was just tired.

48:18.563 --> 48:23.266
Are you
telling us you felt nothing
inside after this man died?

48:26.503 --> 48:28.537
I was just tired.

48:28.539 --> 48:33.242
You had no thoughts,
no feelings,

48:33.244 --> 48:35.011
no emotions.

48:55.233 --> 48:56.966
Mr. labuschagne,
are you all right?

48:58.502 --> 48:59.969
I'm not feeling well.

48:59.971 --> 49:01.237
My lord, I'd like to press on.

49:01.239 --> 49:02.371
Are you feeling faint?

49:02.373 --> 49:02.371
I might be sick.

49:02.373 --> 49:06.108
My lord.
My lord, I'd like to
approach my client.

49:06.110 --> 49:09.345
Mr. weber, if the accused
needs medical attention,

49:09.347 --> 49:09.345
the court will adjourn.

49:09.347 --> 49:13.149
My lord, I'm near the end
of this line of questioning...

49:13.151 --> 49:15.952
You are at the end, Mr. weber.

49:17.254 --> 49:18.988
The court is adjourned.

49:36.573 --> 49:38.341
How could you be so cruel?

49:38.343 --> 49:42.278
It is your job to protect him,
not to hurt him.

49:42.280 --> 49:45.982
My job is to defend him,
miss labuschagne.
That's all I'm trying to do.

49:45.984 --> 49:48.718
You don't need to
abuse him to defend him.

49:49.453 --> 49:51.587
I'm sorry. I'm doing my best.

49:51.589 --> 49:54.357
You don't care if
he hangs, do you?

49:57.060 --> 49:58.394
I'll talk to her.

50:20.550 --> 50:22.118
Hello, Pierre.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.386
How's it?

50:23.388 --> 50:26.022
Well,
you didn't choose this place

50:26.024 --> 50:28.724
for the decor
or the clientele.

50:28.726 --> 50:32.094
Saw you on the TV
the other night,
leaving the court.

50:32.096 --> 50:36.665
Being seen with you
is kind of a liability.

50:36.667 --> 50:41.637
So, we're reduced to
secret,
shabby assignations now.

50:44.474 --> 50:49.078
I can't get you what you want.
My source on
the inside has clammed up.

50:49.080 --> 50:53.049
They're taking
things more cautiously.

50:53.051 --> 50:55.584
Surely, there's something
on a warrant officer

50:55.586 --> 50:58.087
that's a matter
of public record.

50:59.256 --> 51:01.557
I just need to know
what I'm looking for.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.793
I cannot get a file
on the warrant officer.

51:03.795 --> 51:05.394
Or the other warders.

51:05.396 --> 51:10.232
Half these okes don't
even tell their wives
where they're working.

51:11.134 --> 51:13.135
Well,
we've got to find something

51:13.137 --> 51:15.604
or they'll hang him
within six months.

51:15.606 --> 51:17.239
They'll hang him
sooner than that.

51:19.676 --> 51:22.078
A warder who went through
the same ordeal,

51:22.080 --> 51:26.182
someone who liked him.
There must be
somebody who's on his side.

51:26.184 --> 51:29.785
And how the hell do you think
we got what we already have?

51:29.787 --> 51:32.221
Now you listen
to me, 'cause this

51:32.223 --> 51:34.390
is the last of it,
do you understand?

51:34.392 --> 51:37.193
And I'm not seeing you again
until all of
this shit is over.

51:39.729 --> 51:42.832
There was
a prison revolt, a riot,

51:42.834 --> 51:46.268
whatever you wanna
call it, on death row,

51:46.270 --> 51:48.337
his last day.

51:48.339 --> 51:48.337
And?

51:48.339 --> 51:53.843
And they hanged them, anyway.
And that's all
I've got for you.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.812
Wait, wait.

51:56.814 --> 51:58.514
Um...

51:58.516 --> 52:02.284
You know what it feels like,
killing. I don't.

52:02.286 --> 52:05.154
I need to know
what he remembers,
what he tries to block out.

52:05.156 --> 52:06.422
I can't get through
to him unless I know

52:06.424 --> 52:07.656
what's going on
inside his head!

52:08.425 --> 52:10.793
What did it do to you?

52:10.795 --> 52:12.361
You stupid doos.

52:19.603 --> 52:20.803
Pierre!

52:33.283 --> 52:34.583
Mr. weber?

52:42.659 --> 52:44.460
Mr. labuschagne,
consult the register

52:44.462 --> 52:47.863
for your last three days
at maximum, please.

52:55.906 --> 52:59.408
Tell the court what happened
on the 8th of December.

53:02.412 --> 53:04.213
We hanged seven men.

53:04.681 --> 53:06.248
And on the 9th?

53:06.883 --> 53:08.851
Another seven.

53:08.853 --> 53:12.288
And on your
last day, the 10th?

53:12.290 --> 53:14.690
Seven more.

53:14.692 --> 53:18.460
Seven more.
21 men in three days,

53:18.462 --> 53:21.830
which, I understand,
was another record
number of executions

53:21.832 --> 53:23.265
for that amount of days.

53:23.267 --> 53:25.768
Yeah.

53:25.770 --> 53:31.340
Did anything unusual occur
during the executions
on your last day?

53:38.682 --> 53:41.550
Mr. labuschagne,
tell the court what happened

53:41.552 --> 53:44.820
on your last day at maximum,
the 10th of December.

53:47.924 --> 53:50.426
Did the prisoners
who were going up that day

53:50.428 --> 53:52.895
become difficult in some way?

53:55.365 --> 54:00.336
Mr. labuschagne,
you told the court
about your first hanging,

54:00.338 --> 54:03.939
now tell the court about
what you
experienced at your last one.

54:07.778 --> 54:10.012
<i> The warrant officer thought</i>
<i> they'd been broken.</i>

54:14.884 --> 54:16.018
<i> But they weren't.</i>

54:37.507 --> 54:38.874
Get him in there!

54:47.550 --> 54:50.319
<i> Took another half dozen men</i>
<i> to get them out.</i>

56:02.792 --> 56:05.561
<i> We were</i>
<i> ordered to take them up</i>
<i> in straightjackets</i>

56:05.563 --> 56:07.496
<i> and hang them like that.</i>

57:13.930 --> 57:15.130
Don't touch him!

57:54.103 --> 57:57.673
What happened
after the hanging?
What were your duties then?

57:57.675 --> 57:59.775
Just a moment.

57:59.777 --> 58:03.846
Miss marais,
the purpose of this
evidence is to show

58:03.848 --> 58:06.849
that the execution process
was traumatic for the accused.

58:06.851 --> 58:09.017
I'm sure the state
would admit to that by now.

58:09.019 --> 58:10.819
Is this correct, miss marais?

58:12.989 --> 58:15.190
We are prepared to admit that.

58:15.192 --> 58:18.494
Is there any
need for more detail
in this area, Mr. weber?

58:20.930 --> 58:20.929
It's damage control.

58:20.931 --> 58:25.501
They're trying to do to us
what we did to them.

58:25.503 --> 58:28.270
My lord, we're grateful for
the concession by the state,

58:28.272 --> 58:30.772
but we're going to
have to lead this evidence,

58:30.774 --> 58:30.772
unpleasant as it may be.

58:30.774 --> 58:34.710
We're conscious of our duty
to avoid unnecessary evidence,

58:34.712 --> 58:37.112
but we are equally
conscious of our duty

58:37.114 --> 58:39.715
to present
the defense case fully.

58:43.787 --> 58:45.888
Mr. labuschagne, continue.

58:46.756 --> 58:48.757
What happened
after the hangings?

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:31.259
<i> We</i>
<i> tossed a coin to see</i>

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:33.729
<i> who had to take</i>
<i> them to the cemetery.</i>

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.664
<i> I lost.</i>

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:36.898
Amen.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.066
Amen.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.214
Stop!

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.310
Isaiah!

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:10.312
What
happened when you got back

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:12.080
to the prison.
Mr. labuschagne?

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.017
I fainted.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:20.355
And they took me to the medic.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:25.594
I had a bump on
the left side of my head
from the accident

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:27.963
and I was
bleeding from my ear.

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:33.201
Were you
offered any treatment?

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:37.973
The medic gave me
a headache tablet.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.510
A headache tablet.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:48.083
What happened next?

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:52.487
I came off duty,
and started for home.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:54.456
But the storm was really bad.

01:04:57.326 --> 01:05:00.161
What happened, Mr.
labuschagne?

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.377
<i> All I can remember</i>
<i> is how tired I was.</i>

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:17.646
<i> How tired I was of everything.</i>

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.352
The minibus...

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:30.191
There was almost
another accident.

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:48.410
You remember what happened?

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:55.283
Mr. labuschagne, what happened

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:58.687
after you nearly
had an accident
with the minibus?

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:29.317
<i> You followed them up</i>
<i> the quarry road</i>
<i> to magazine hill.</i>

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:36.591
Once you and the driver
reached the dead
end at the quarry,

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.361
what occurred?

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.774
I heard the trapdoors open.

01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:55.343
Can you say that again?

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:58.580
I heard the sound of
the trapdoors opening.

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:02.450
Proceed.

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:09.157
Take your time.
Tell it slowly.

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:14.562
I smelled the rope.

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:21.736
Could taste
the smell of the rope
in my throat.

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:26.441
The quarry, Mr. labuschagne,
what occurred there?

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:38.420
I can't remember.

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:44.192
So, that's it,
you can't remember?

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:46.194
Mr. weber,
do you have anything else
for the defense?

01:07:46.196 --> 01:07:49.364
Mr. labuschagne,
what happened next?

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.401
What do you remember?

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:00.642
Mr. labuschagne!

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:03.144
Mr. weber,
this is highly improper!

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:05.547
Will you return
to the bar at once.

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:14.856
I'm sorry, my lord.

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:16.491
And so you should be.

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:18.827
It should never happen again.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:22.162
Do you have any
other line of questioning

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:24.799
for this witness at
this time, Mr. weber?

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:39.413
My lord,
i have no further questions.
Thank you.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:46.821
Miss marais.

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:50.492
As the court pleases.

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:54.362
So, you say that
the execution process
and the work in the pit room

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:57.131
upset you greatly.
Is that what you're saying?

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:01.636
You have to speak up.
The evidence
has to be recorded

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:04.606
and a nod or
a shake of your head
will not be recorded.

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:09.377
Miss marais is right.
Speak up and direct
your answers to us.

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:12.247
So, you're saying
that the execution process

01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:15.750
and the work in the pit room
upset you greatly.

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:18.752
Yes.

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:20.522
But weren't you
playing the fool

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:22.457
in all
the sections of the prison,

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:25.627
including the gallows room,
the pit room,

01:09:25.629 --> 01:09:27.228
and even the chapel?

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:31.432
No.

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:33.801
Let me see if I can
give your memory a jolt.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:39.674
Can you recall
an occasion when you
gave a new warder a fright

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.609
by putting white
chalk on your face

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:44.845
and hiding in
one of the freezers
in the autopsy room?

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:49.584
It wasn't me.

01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:54.689
But you smiled
when I reminded you
of the incident. Why?

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:56.958
Don't know that I smiled.

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:00.261
So, what is your answer?

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.531
You remember the incident,
do you?

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.768
I heard about it.

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:08.870
You climbed up on the catwalk

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:12.240
and scared prisoners
by making ghost noises.

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:16.778
It's not true.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:21.282
You sprayed the other warders
with the hose

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:22.750
while cleaning the pit room.

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.920
Some of us got
wet while cleaning.

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:28.356
You once put a lit cigarette

01:10:28.358 --> 01:10:32.560
in the mouth of
an executed prisoner
before closing his coffin.

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:36.231
And the smoke leaked out

01:10:36.233 --> 01:10:38.833
with his family
there for the funeral.

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:43.738
It wasn't me.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.673
All you have
to do is say yes or no.

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:48.343
If any explanation is needed,
i will ask you
for an explanation.

01:10:48.345 --> 01:10:50.878
Otherwise, you can leave
your explanations for later

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.748
when your
advocate re-examines you.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:57.485
And do not speak
to miss marais.
Address your answers to me.

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.687
You collected beads.

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.024
No.

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:13.601
New coffins arrived with lids
that came in two pieces,

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:17.438
a head piece and
a longer body piece.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.608
So that you could
get your fingers
beneath the head piece

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:26.314
to open the coffin,
they pre-set
little plastic beads

01:11:26.316 --> 01:11:27.915
beneath the lid, didn't they?

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:31.953
Yellow ones,
green ones, white ones,

01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:34.422
and even little pink ones.

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:39.327
They're washers.

01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:40.795
They're washers, you say.

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:44.999
Yes.

01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:47.902
You collected these washers.

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:49.871
You kept a washer
for every prisoner

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:51.773
you escorted to the gallows,
didn't you?

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:57.045
It wasn't like that.

01:11:57.047 --> 01:11:59.781
You kept one
washer from each coffin

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:02.984
like notches on
a gunslinger's six-shooter.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.887
You did so because there was
a competition between warders

01:12:05.889 --> 01:12:09.724
to see who could
collect the most,
wasn't there?

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.662
I was ordered to do the work.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:16.764
Please look at
this photograph.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.501
These are
the washers you collected

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:22.470
before you were arrested,
correct?

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:22.470
Yes.

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:22.470
You kept these
washers in your drawer.

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:28.042
This photograph was
taken at your house
when the police searched it.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:30.478
You'd placed
the washers from the 8th and

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.680
the 9th on the string already,
hadn't you?

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.118
You'll have to speak.

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:39.687
Yes.

01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:44.025
I suggest to you
that your evidence that

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:45.860
you were upset by
the execution process

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:48.396
and the work you had
to do in the pit room
is just a facade

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:51.532
and that, in truth,
you actually enjoyed the work.

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:03.478
In fact, you got used
to this special work
very quickly, didn't you?

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:07.081
The special work of killing.

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:18.159
That must've made
you feel important
and powerful,

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:21.095
knowing that you could kill
and not be prosecuted for it.

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:27.902
No one except us
knew about
the work we're doing.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:30.405
So, how would that
make me feel
important or powerful?

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:32.039
Don't ask me questions.

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:33.808
You knew
you were immune
to prosecution,

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.810
that you had
the blessing of the law,
didn't you?

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:40.114
We didn't do the killing,
the hangman did.

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:46.154
Yet you've told
the court that you had to
pull prisoners up by the neck

01:13:46.156 --> 01:13:48.022
and drop them again,
haven't you?

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:52.059
Yes, but we didn't actually
touch the prisoners.

01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:53.694
We only touched the rope.
It was what

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:55.062
the warrant
officer told us to do!

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:55.062
But you dropped them again

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:59.167
so that their necks
would break cleanly,
didn't you?

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.170
Yes.
So, in those cases,

01:14:02.172 --> 01:14:04.439
the executioner
pushed the lever,

01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:07.975
but his hand did not cause
the prisoner's
neck to break, did it?

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:10.011
Your hands did.

01:14:10.013 --> 01:14:13.915
My lord, with respect,
the question is
actually an argument

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.783
and not a question
the witness can answer.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:19.187
You told us Mr. labuschagne's
state of mind was relevant,

01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:21.055
and that every
bit of information

01:14:21.057 --> 01:14:24.192
that has a bearing
on his state of mind
is admissible.

01:14:24.194 --> 01:14:26.928
So,
I'd like to hear the answer.

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:29.797
You physically
raised the prisoners
and then dropped them again

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:31.466
so that they would die.

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:32.967
Yes.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:36.938
When a prisoner's neck broke,
after the trapdoor had opened,

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:40.608
you saw the executioner's hand
as the one that
had done the killing.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.811
Yes, it was his hand.

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:47.148
So, by the same token,
when you hauled a prisoner up

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:50.852
dropped him down,
and his neck broke,

01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:54.622
it was not
the executioner's hand
that did the killing, was it?

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:00.261
I see what you mean.

01:15:00.263 --> 01:15:03.064
So, it was your hand
that did the killing.

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:07.134
And it was your hand that
did the killing at the quarry,
too, wasn't it?

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:17.545
You can't
remember what happened

01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:19.146
at the quarry,
is that what you say?

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:23.017
But I've told you
what I can remember.

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:27.054
You claim you have no memory
of the shooting.

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:28.689
Is that how we are to
understand your evidence?

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.291
But I can't remember!

01:15:30.293 --> 01:15:34.061
So, your defense
is not that you
didn't shoot them,

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:36.797
but that you can't
remember shooting them.

01:15:36.799 --> 01:15:38.766
Is that how we are
to understand it?

01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:42.803
My lord,
it's not for the accused
to answer questions of law.

01:15:42.805 --> 01:15:44.272
I alone can answer questions

01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:47.708
such as those proposed
by my learned friend.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.288
No more questions, my lord.

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:08.062
Mr. weber, do you intend
to re-examine the accused?

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:17.672
If it pleases my lord.

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:25.980
You killed them.

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.751
Everyone knows that.

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:33.054
Isn't that right?

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:40.928
Isn't that right, Mr.
labuschagne?

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.641
I don't know.

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:59.013
I mean, it must've been me.

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:08.189
But I don't understand.

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:14.996
Two years ago,
you were a school prefect
and active in the church.

01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:18.132
And now you're here in court,
on trial for murder.

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:22.136
How did that happen?

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:29.910
I don't know.

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:33.347
You were a husband, a father,

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:36.183
but now neither your wife
nor your daughter will
visit you in the cells

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:39.153
and they've not
attended court, either,
have they?

01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:52.733
What brought
about this change,
Mr. labuschagne?

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:02.843
Tell us what happened,
the reasons you
fired those shots.

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:42.383
Mr. labuschagne!

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:48.723
You were having problems,
weren't you?

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:52.960
So, why didn't you go
to the warrant officer
and ask to seek for help?

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:55.029
A psychiatrist
could've helped you!

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.775
Why didn't you tell me?

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.313
Before I started
hurting my wife.

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:14.982
Mr. labuschagne.

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:16.450
Before I lost everything.

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:22.189
Before I killed seven people!

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:24.258
Mr. labuschagne!

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:27.094
Why didn't you tell me!

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:28.362
That is enough!

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:29.964
Bailiff!

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:29.964
Why didn't you tell me?

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:33.334
Remove the accused
from the dock.

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:41.842
Order!

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.312
If I'd known what
you were going to do,

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:47.982
I would never have allowed
further questioning.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.351
Court adjourned.

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:48.509
They pass these cases off
to the most junior advocates

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:48.509
because no one cares.

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:53.614
The judges hand
down death sentences
in the name of the law.

01:20:53.616 --> 01:20:55.950
And the prison officials say
they're just witnesses,

01:20:55.952 --> 01:20:58.285
it's the hangman
that does the killing.

01:20:58.287 --> 01:21:02.056
It's denial of responsibility
all the way down the line.

01:21:02.058 --> 01:21:03.490
What's the hangman's
excuse then?

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:06.026
It's gravity's fault,
i suppose.

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:18.539
<i> Tell us in your own words</i>
<i> what you observed.</i>

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:24.912
<i> Mr. labuschagne,</i>
<i> the court is waiting.</i>

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:32.553
<i> What happened after you</i>
<i> nearly had</i>
<i> an accident with the minibus?</i>

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:40.961
<i> The quarry, Mr. labuschagne.</i>
<i> Tell us what you remember.</i>

01:21:40.963 --> 01:21:43.264
<i> You followed them</i>
<i> up the quarry road</i>
<i> to magazine hill,</i>

01:21:43.266 --> 01:21:46.166
<i> and once you</i>
<i> reached the dead end,</i>
<i> what occurred?</i>

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:50.237
<i> What happened, Mr.</i>
<i> labuschagne?</i>

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:52.940
<i> What did you see?</i>

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:01.982
<i> The noise.</i>

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:33.447
You'll lead
the inspection <i> in loco,</i> weber.

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:36.650
Frankly, I'm
surprised Kathleen consented.

01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:39.720
I would've expected
to close a case
like this by now.

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:45.359
Well, thank you, judge.

01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:49.063
I'd like to start
by having the accused

01:22:49.065 --> 01:22:51.665
stand next to
the door of the bakkie,

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:55.269
so that we can
measure the exact distance
from there to the minibus.

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:11.418
I'd now like
the accused to raise his arm

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:14.088
and point toward the minibus.

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:26.567
Can we agree that the distance
is no more than 10 meters?

01:23:26.569 --> 01:23:29.570
Ten-and-a-half, I'd say.
- Anything else?

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:15.549
Leon.

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:19.820
Leon.

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:24.691
Why did you bring us here?

01:24:24.693 --> 01:24:28.462
Judge,
we think this is the trigger

01:24:28.464 --> 01:24:32.666
for an unconditioned
response in him,
that he acted unconsciously.

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:35.069
Something to do
with this door.

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:44.845
J.P., we would like the court
to take note of the

01:24:44.847 --> 01:24:48.115
winding and undulating nature
of the track
leading to the quarry.

01:24:48.117 --> 01:24:49.516
And the rocks in the roadway.

01:24:49.518 --> 01:24:51.251
It would
require a very conscious

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:52.719
effort to drive
over such terrain.

01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:52.719
Noted.

01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:57.157
If there's nothing else, we'll
reassemble back at court.

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:03.297
Judge,
i have one further request

01:25:03.299 --> 01:25:05.666
before we
terminate the inspection.

01:26:01.523 --> 01:26:03.891
So, what are we here to see,
Mr. weber?

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:08.529
I wonder if
the warrant officer
would be kind enough

01:26:08.531 --> 01:26:11.331
to throw the lever
and release the trapdoor.

01:26:58.446 --> 01:27:00.247
Leon.

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:12.693
Leon,

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:17.464
what I did today...

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:20.701
I just wanted to explain...

01:27:20.703 --> 01:27:22.336
I'm just so sorry...

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.474
...for what I've done.

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:32.346
I'm just so sorry.

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:46.593
This list of names

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:51.498
of men hanged
at maximum security prison

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:57.904
might look like
any list of names
and dates and numbers.

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.975
Nothing more than
an anonymous flock.

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:07.681
But to Leon labuschagne,

01:28:07.683 --> 01:28:10.751
these were real people
who entered his life.

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:16.523
He processed them,
placed them in their cells,

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:21.295
woke them,
saw that they were fed,

01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:26.533
took them to the showers
and the exercise yard,

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:28.635
met their families.

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:33.674
Searched them, touched them.

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:41.315
Read their mail,
led their Bible studies,
and then,

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:45.052
he took them to the gallows.

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:55.062
Some he was made to kill
with his own hands.

01:28:55.064 --> 01:28:59.733
After which
he handled their dead,
naked bodies,

01:28:59.735 --> 01:29:01.802
and buried them.

01:29:04.038 --> 01:29:07.407
No, to Leon labuschagne,

01:29:07.409 --> 01:29:11.712
this is not
an abstract list of names,
or an anonymous flock.

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:16.717
But the list is incomplete

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:20.787
because there's
a name missing from it.

01:29:24.459 --> 01:29:27.661
And that name is

01:29:27.663 --> 01:29:29.429
Leon Albert labuschagne.

01:29:29.431 --> 01:29:30.997
That is ridiculous, Mr. weber!

01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:35.001
Is it? He spent his whole time
locked in with them!

01:29:35.003 --> 01:29:37.537
He shared every moment
of their last days with them,

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:38.972
and then he was
made to witness

01:29:38.974 --> 01:29:40.607
the gruesome
details of their deaths

01:29:40.609 --> 01:29:43.910
on a regular and
extended basis!

01:29:43.912 --> 01:29:46.713
He has been sentenced to death
as surely as all the others!

01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:48.749
That is
a ridiculous submission!

01:29:48.751 --> 01:29:51.084
It is not ridiculous, my lord!

01:29:51.086 --> 01:29:53.587
What is
ridiculous is the denial

01:29:53.589 --> 01:29:55.856
of what we have
done to this young man!

01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:01.461
My lord, gentlemen,
you cannot ask a man

01:30:01.463 --> 01:30:05.532
to be both
Shepherd and butcher
at the same time.

01:30:27.955 --> 01:30:29.856
Miss marais,

01:30:29.858 --> 01:30:32.993
do you have a final reply
to the defense's argument?

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:41.968
My lord, gentlemen assessors.

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:47.140
May I remind the court
that this is a case of murder.

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:50.977
Murder seven times over.

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:55.615
And that the court
should declare it to be such.

01:30:57.151 --> 01:31:02.189
Leon labuschagne,
trained in
the physical act of killing,

01:31:02.191 --> 01:31:06.126
herded his victims
to a secluded area,

01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:08.962
where he shot and killed them.

01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:16.570
He has not been
a good witness,
but evasive and unresponsive.

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:20.474
And now he tries
the court's indulgence

01:31:20.476 --> 01:31:24.945
with a farfetched
and unconvincing effort
to save his own life.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.862
J.P. Says
they won't give
judgment tomorrow.

01:31:41.864 --> 01:31:43.964
They apparently
need another day.

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:47.033
Wonder what that's about.

01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:51.905
Perhaps one of the assessors
might not agree with
the proposed verdict

01:31:51.907 --> 01:31:55.242
and the judge would prefer
a unanimous decision.

01:31:57.845 --> 01:32:01.515
So, they're just being
careful, taking their time.

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:03.850
Bad news for you, then.

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:08.788
They take longer
with a conviction
than an acquittal.

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:16.663
J.P. Will want to write
an appeal-proof judgment.

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:21.201
Have a good evening.

01:32:21.203 --> 01:32:22.669
And you.

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:28.875
Nice closing argument.

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:05.845
You want to talk?

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:24.264
Anne says you
disappear quite often.
Sometimes for days.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.969
What is this,
one of your
cross examinations?

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:32.706
Tell me what's
going on, Pierre.

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:35.875
We're alone.
You're drunk enough.

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.280
What does it matter?

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:46.119
You're not on down-time,
are you?

01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:48.388
You're running
an op somewhere.

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:58.298
We bombed a house today.

01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:00.367
Is that what you want to hear?

01:34:05.873 --> 01:34:07.207
It's your job, right?

01:34:07.209 --> 01:34:08.742
Yes, it's my job!

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:16.049
I serve this country.
It is my duty,
and that is why I do it!

01:34:16.051 --> 01:34:19.119
So, why are you drunk
and in a state about it, then?

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:11.137
Mr. labuschagne,
please stand up.

01:35:24.318 --> 01:35:27.253
We are not united
in our findings of the facts

01:35:27.255 --> 01:35:29.723
and there will be
a majority verdict.

01:35:30.758 --> 01:35:33.460
I shall read
the judgment of the majority

01:35:33.462 --> 01:35:37.797
and their verdict,
not the opinion of
the dissenting member,

01:35:37.799 --> 01:35:39.933
will be
the verdict of this court.

01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:44.270
Mr. labuschagne,

01:35:44.272 --> 01:35:47.040
while your defense counsel
have put forward the argument

01:35:47.042 --> 01:35:50.910
that your actions were not
conscious or voluntary,
as required by law,

01:35:50.912 --> 01:35:54.814
this court
finds you guilty of
murder as charged.

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:57.984
However, due to
the extraordinary events

01:35:57.986 --> 01:35:59.953
that led to your
actions at the quarry,

01:35:59.955 --> 01:36:04.357
the court finds
extenuating
circumstances present.

01:36:04.359 --> 01:36:06.993
You are therefore sentenced
to 20 years imprisonment

01:36:06.995 --> 01:36:09.395
with the possibility
of early parole,

01:36:09.397 --> 01:36:13.032
based upon your progress
in a program of
psychiatric treatment,

01:36:13.034 --> 01:36:15.869
supervised by a state
appointed psychologist.

01:36:49.403 --> 01:36:50.904
Well done.

01:36:50.906 --> 01:36:55.575
Congratulations.
I wouldn't have thought
anyone could pull that off.

01:36:59.079 --> 01:37:01.381
It won't be a popular decision
on either side.

01:37:03.884 --> 01:37:06.386
Somebody once said,
"in the cycle of killing,

01:37:06.388 --> 01:37:10.123
"there's no beginning or end,
just more killing."

01:37:10.125 --> 01:37:13.092
Maybe we addressed
that on some level.

01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:18.064
Take care.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.974
Thank you, sir.

01:45:46.406 --> 01:45:49.475
