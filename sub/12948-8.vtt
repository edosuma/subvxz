WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
BOY:
Hold on, I just got

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
out of the shower.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
There's some juice
on the table.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Mm-hm.
Take your time.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
You wanna explain to me
what you're doing here?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
I came looking
for booty.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
You came looking for sex
with an underage boy?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Oh, no. I ain't come looking
for no little boys.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
I ain't got no milk,
no cookies, nothing.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
I came looking
for man's butt.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
A man's butt?
Excuse me?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Oh, I know who you are,
Chris Hansen.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
But see I calls you
Chris Handsome.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
I watch your TV show
all the time.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
So you can go ahead
and bring in them cameras

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
and them police
is waiting outside.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
It don't make me
no difference.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Now, I'll tell you what.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I like you,
and I want you.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Now, we can do this
the easy way,

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
or we can do it
the hard way.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
The choice is yours.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Well, I don't think
you and I

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
will be doing anything
any kind of way.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Okay, I see
you choosing the hard way.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Okay, cut.
This isn't working.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Someone get this guy out--

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Don't make me ruin
that butt, Chris!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
No. Please!
I'm a warrior!

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
HUEY: Tom DuBois was widely known

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
to be a friend of the gay community.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Tom was a crusader for gay marriage.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
He marched in gay pride parades.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
He watched gay movies and never once turned away

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
or even made a face during the gay sex scenes.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
TOM:
Wow.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Sean Penn is amazing.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
HUEY: But beneath Tom's support

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
of the gay community

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
was a dark secret.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Tom had a fear of going to jail

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
and being anally raped.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Hey, hey, hey nigga.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
You got a nice
little ass, nigga.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Gimme your ass, nigga.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You see me looking at you.
Gimme your ass.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
No! Stay away!
MAN: Hey, brown skin!

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
HUEY: The phobia got so bad

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
he took a leave of absence from his job.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Eventually, he stopped leaving the house altogether.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Finally, Tom found a program specializing in his phobia,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
treating patients with a combination

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
of group therapy...  ■
My name is Tom.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
And I have a fear
of going to jail

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
and being anally raped.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
ALL:
Hi, Tom.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
confidence-building affirmations...

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
ALL:
My booty is mine.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
It belongs to me.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
You cannot take my booty.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
...and basic self-defense.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
So when grabbed
from behind,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
The first thing we do
is drop our center of gravity.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Then, we thrust
our hips backwards

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
and our arms forward,
breaking the hold.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Okay, Tom.
Now, I'll do you

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
and you try to get me off.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I can't!

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
It was a long road to recovery.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
PRINCIPAL:
This is the third time

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
your boys have been caught

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
fighting this quarter,
Mr. Freeman.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
This time, it was a brawl
against five other boys.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
What happened to him?
He got in the way.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
You have two options,
Mr. Freeman.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
The first is that both
of your boys

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
are expelled from school.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Ooh,
I'll take that one.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Pick that one,
Granddad!

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
And, uh,
what's the other?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
We send your boys to prison.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Hold up. Don't you think
that's a little--

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
This is a permission slip
for our Scared Stiff program.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Delinquent students
visit a real jail

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
so they can interact
with real inmates

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
and see the real future
that awaits them

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
if they continue with their
pathological behavior.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Ooh, I change my mind,
Granddad!

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Pick jail! Pick jail!
Pick jail! Pick jail!

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Please let me go to jail!

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Tom, do you have something

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
you'd like to share
with the group?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Why, yes I do.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
My name is Tom.
And I am no longer afraid

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
of going to prison
and being anally raped.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
That's fantastic, Tom.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And to prove it,
tomorrow I'm going to prison.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
MAN: Did he say--?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I've agreed to chaperone
a Scared Stiff program.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm taking a group
of troubled youths to prison

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
so they can mend
their ways.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Well, that's excellent, Tom.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
MAN:
Whoa, man,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
are you sure about that?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Absolutely.
I'm looking forward to it.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
See? Tom is going to face
his fears head on.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
And he's gonna walk out
of that prison with his rectum

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
and his peace of mind
intact.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Way to go, Tom!
MAN: Way to go, buddy.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Anybody wanna come
with me?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
ALL: No.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
No? Okay.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
SARAH:
Honey, it is great

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
that you're making

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
so much progress
with the therapy,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
but I just don't want you

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
to think you have to prove
anything to anyone.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Oh, honey--
Look, I'm not worried

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
about your safety,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
but I'd hate for you to have
a bad experience

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
and go back to
how you were.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
You know,
I was thinking about

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
becoming
a defense attorney.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
But how can I do that

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
if I'm too scared
to step foot in prison?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
How would I meet
with the clients?

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Wow! Tom.
I had no idea.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Imagine it, sweetie.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Saving people
from anal rape

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
instead of sending them
to it.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And that's what this trip
is about.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
These boys need
this trip.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
They don't fear
jail at all,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
which means they'll probably
end up there

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
if no one does anything.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Don't you see, honey?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
If I'm afraid
to live my life

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
then the anal rapists win.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
My anus
is gonna be fine.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
And I'm gonna make sure
those young boys' anuses

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
are just fine too.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Pause.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
TOM:
Okay, guys,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
remember to stay

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
with the group at all times.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And remember,
nothing metal in your pockets.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
The guards will take it away
from you

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
and you won't
get it back, okay?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Ah, okay, this is it.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
All right, alrighty.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
My name is Uncle Ruckus,
Volunteer Corrections Officer.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Next stop, Willie Horton
Maximum Security Prison.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Now, you white
children be prepared.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
This is gonna be
like a trip to the zoo.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
But do not worry,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
your Uncle Ruckus
will protect you.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And as for you Negroes,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
well, this just gonna be
like a trip to the future.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
So it should be exciting
for everybody!

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Come on aboard!

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
We got mm-hm, all right...

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Wait, where's Riley?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Riley, what are you doing?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Nothing.
Give it here.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Come on.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Riley, I am very
disappointed in you.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Now go get on that bus.
We going inside, Mr. DuBois.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Anything
can happen in there.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
I gots to have
my shank.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
You want me make you one?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I brought
an extra toothbrush.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Now.
Man, if something happens,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
it's your fault.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
RILEY: Anything can happen

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
in there.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
If something happens, it's your fault.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Anything can happen in there. We going inside, Mr. DuBois.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
MAN:
Put my finger

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
in your ass, man.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
It's tougher
to shock kids nowadays.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
They already know
what goes on in jail.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
But we do our best to scare
the living shit out of them.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
CONVICT:
Some of you are here today

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
'cause you think jail is cool.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
But see y'all wouldn't
know nothing about that shit.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Ain't shit cool
about jail, nyukka!

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
MAN:
Ain't nothing cool.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I been here 10 years,
and I ain't never getting out.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I ain't do much.
Just kill somebody.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
It ain't like the nyukka
ain't have it coming.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
MAN: He sure did.
Y'all think

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
it's just about us in here,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
but this is about
an oppressive,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
fucked-up system
designed to keep niggas

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
down and shit.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Y'all wouldn't know
nothing about that.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
What about you, little nigga?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
You know about that?
Yes.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Oh, you know about that?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Tell me
what you know about that!

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Tell me what you think
about that!

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
The prison-industrial complex
is a system situated

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
at the intersection
of government

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
and private interests.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
It uses prisons as a solution
to social, political,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
and economic problems.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It includes
human rights violations,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
the death penalty,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
slave labor,
policing, courts,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
the media,
political prisoners,

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
and the elimination of dissent.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Nigga, did you just say

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
what I was trying to say
but smarter?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
I like this little nigga.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
But you left one thing out,
little nigga.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Show of hands, how many people
ever raped a man.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
RILEY:
Pause. Heh-heh.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Uh-huh. How many people
ever been raped by a man?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
RILEY:
Pause again.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
All of them.
One hundred percent.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
You can't get no higher
than that, nyukka.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
You step in here,
you getting raped.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
Right up the motherfucking
brown eye, baby.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I raped a few niggas myself.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I ain't really enjoy it,
not that much.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Shit, it felt good
to the motherfucker though.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I ain't let that nigga
kiss me or nothing,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
but I did tear that
motherfucking ass up, nigga,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I ain't gonna lie about it.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
But that's what the Man's

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
oppressive system did to me.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Now, me?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I'm more
of a romantic type.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'll still rape you,
but I'll definitely stroke

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
your head lovingly
while I do it.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
See, cause I want you
to like it.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Now, you don't have
to like it.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
But I--

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Sorry. I was distracted

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
by that fine motherfucker
right there.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
What's your name,
fine motherfucker?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I, uh...
MAN: What's your name?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Don't think that's, um--
Tom.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Okay, now let's talk
about Tom.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Tom is the type of nigga

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
that gives us
wet dreams up in here.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Medium brown.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Soft features.
Tall and in shape,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
but still soft and squishy.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Now, I like to put
the jelly inside my ass.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Then put some of this peanut
butter on top of it.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I call it a peanut butter-jelly
and asshole sandwich.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
But Tom here
will be calling it lunch.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
MAN:
Yeah, nigga!

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
You know what the system
does when you come to prison?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
They strip you.
They strip you mentally,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
emotionally,
and they strip you naked.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
But-ass naked! What the fuck
is you looking at nigga?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Punch you right in your
motherfucking temple, nigga.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Give me your clothes.
MAN: Beat his ass.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
You're supposed
to be scaring the kids.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I said give me your clothes.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Start with your shoes. Hurry up.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
You need some help?
I got it.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Now you see this, kids?
You really,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
really, don't want this
to happen to you, okay?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
CONVICT:
And your shirt too,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
nigga! Hurry up!

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
MAN:
Take it off!

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
CONVICT:
Okay. Y'all

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
motherfuckers looking, huh?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Tom just got his motherfucking
manhood tested.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And he failed.
He should have knocked

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
my motherfucking
head off.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
And you know
what that means, don't you?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Tom, you getting raped.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
When you go to prison,
the most important thing

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
in your life
is gonna be booty.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
MAN:
Better listen to him.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
A man's butt.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Booty, getting some booty

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
is more important
than eating food.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It's more important
than drinking water.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
If I see a man I like,
I tell him like this here:

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I likes you, and I want you.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Now, we can do this
the easy way,

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
or we can do it
the hard way.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
The choice is yours.
MAN: What you want?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
What's it gonna be?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
MAN 1: Say it, nigga.
I asked you a question, Tom.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
MAN 2: I can't hear you.
MAN 3: Say it, Tom!

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I-I don't want to answer.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Uh, excuse me
I didn't hear you, Tom.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I said I-I don't want to answer.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
I don't wanna...

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't wanna do this
anymore.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Sound like to me
you want it the hard way.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
MAN:
Give it to him!

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
GUARD:
Out of the way!

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
All right,
everybody calm down!

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Calm down! Now we taking
over the prison.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
So back up! Back up!

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Back up! Back up!

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You can't have my booty!

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
GUARD:
Get him! Get him!

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
REPORTER:
And more reports coming

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
in that hostages

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
are being held
inside the prison.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
WOMAN: Hello, 911 emergency.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh, my God. Listen,
you have to help!

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Help me, please! Sir, please calm down.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
What's your emergency?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm inside William Horton
Maximum Security Prison

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
and they attacked
the guards.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I think there's
a riot happening.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
They've got hostages too.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Children. Oh, my God,
I left the children.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Sir, where did you say you were again?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm inside the prison.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
How long before the cops
come in and save us?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Well, I wouldn't hold your breath.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah, I got a guy on the phone that says

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
he's at Horton Prison.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I-I don't know, I'll ask.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Uh, sir, have they raped you yet?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Ha-ha-ha!  ■
Have they raped--

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
No! What kind of a fucked
up question is that?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Hello?
AUTOMATED VOICE:  Hello.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
You have a collect call from a correctional facility from:

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
AUTOMATED VOICE: Do you accept the call?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yes! Yes!
TOM:  Honey!

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Oh, Tom! What's wrong?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I was in the prison, and...

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Riley had a shank and I--
I didn't throw it away

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
and then it started a riot.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Damn it, who let
that booty get away?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Don't look at me, I was fighting
with the guards.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Well, what do we do now?
Ask him, it was his idea.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I thought you had some
escape plan worked out.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Wasn't no escape plan.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Uh, booty is more
important than escaping.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
So I said to myself
when I seen that shank,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
"This an opportunity for me
to get some booty."

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
That was it? Nigga,
I thought you had demands.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Oh, I had demands.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I had demands
to get some booty.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I thought this was supposed
to be some Attica type shit.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Now, how y'all think
that make me feel?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Y'all let the booty get away.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Now I got to go
hunt down the booty. Damn.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Tom!

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
RUCKUS:
Please. Do what you want

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
to them two little
gorilla chimps over there.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
But leave these beautiful
little white children alone.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Are you gonna rape us?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Do we look like priests?
We ain't gonna hurt no kids.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Now, that's good. That's good.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
But it is okay
if you do hurt them.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Hey, nigga. Hey,
didn't I just say

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
we ain't gonna hurt no kids?
So shut the fuck up

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
and let me think!

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
No plan, huh?
We didn't exactly

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
put a whole lot of thought
into this,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
you know what I'm saying?
Guess we just kind of,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
you know, got caught up
in the motherfucking moment.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
You have grievances, right?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Like a motherfucker.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Well, you got hostages.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Might as well
make the best of it.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Make a list
of reasonable demands

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
in exchange for the hostages
and this might all work out.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Hey, yo, what y'all think,
niggas?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Should we try to like, uh,
you know what I'm saying

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
and shit, like, uh, negotiate

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
with these motherfuckers
for stuff?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
There's definitely some things
I'd like to see changed.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Me too.
Well, if we gonna do this shit,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
we need to do it right.
We can't just be acting like

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
a bunch of wild ignorant niggas

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
out there just be shouting out
demands and shit.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
We got a motherfucking
black president now.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Ha! Good luck! Baboon Bama'll
be in here soon too.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Hey, hey! You ain't too fat

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
and ugly to get raped,
motherfucker.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I apologize for my outburst.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I left the kids.
I gotta go back for the kids.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Honey, just stay there.
Let the professionals handle it.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
No. This is all my f-fault.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I have to make it right.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I love you, sweetie.  ■
Tom!

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
No,
please don't be brave.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Bravery isn't your thing.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I love you, sweetie.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
If I don't come back,
tell Jazmine that I-I...

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
CONVICT:
Okay, so all the motions

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
brought before this
motherfucking committee

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
to add, uh, a demand
to the official list of demands

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
will be ratified
with a motherfucking

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
majority vote, nigga.
Unless that demand is vetoed

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
from the committee chief
executive,

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
at which point it will require

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
a two-third majority vote
to pass.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Yo, who gets to be
the chief executive?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I'm the motherfucking
chief executive, motherfucker.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I didn't vote for you.
I thought this was

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
a democracy,
you autocratic motherfucker.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Come over here,
and say that shit

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
and I'll turn your motherfucking
teeth upside down.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
The chief executive
is a rotating office to be held

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
by each member of
the Executive Riot Committee

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
in order of prison ID number,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
for a period not to exceed
90 minutes' time.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Well, wait a goddamn minute.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Who the fuck is this
Executive Riot Committee?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Us.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Oh yeah, right.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Okay, good.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
First motion to introduce
a demand for rafification:

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
all in favor of bitches?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Brother Huey, let the record

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
show that the motion has passed.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Please add "bitches"
to the official list of demands.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
ALL:
Yeah! Bitches!

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Okay, next motion?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
White bitches.
Wait.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Isn't that covered
in bitches?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Hold up! Bitches
and white bitches

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
is two different things.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Well, then we have
to go back and amend

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
the previous demand
to specify white bitches.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Why we gotta have
a white bitch

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
because you got a white bitch?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
To me it's a wasted demand.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
They never gonna give us
a white bitch.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
They never give us one
if we don't ask.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
We got to stand up,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
and not just demand bitches,
but white bitches.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Well, fuck it then,
I want me an Alaskan bitch.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Beggars can't be choosers,
motherfucker.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
We already asking
for bitches, all right?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
We have white hostages.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
We have the strategic
leverage to get white bitches.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Man, y'all being
too picky, man.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
A bitch is a bitch.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Man, look, look,
why can't y'all

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
just shut the fuck up
and be happy

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
with whatever bitch
we get up in here?

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
I guess you never heard
the phrase "Yes, we can."

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It's my God-given right
as an inmate

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
to have a white bitch.
That's not a God-given right

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
for an inmate.
Or anyone else, really.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Oh. Well, I may not have
a God-given right

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
to white bitches.
But I do have a God-given right

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
to ask for white bitches.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Hey, man, the nigga
do have a point.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Hey, he's right.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Motion to add
"white bitches"

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
to the official list
of demands.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Everyone in favor?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Motion passes.
Please add

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
"white bitches" to the official
list of demands.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Okay, next motion.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000

the bitches in here

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I'll stop tapping your ass.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Okay, so the list
so far is: "Bitches.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
"White bitches, Asian bitches,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
"Brazilian bitches,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
"East Indian Bitches,
West Indian Bitches...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Ruckus! Come on!

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
"Broadband internet porn,
K-Y Jelly, Condoms,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Viagra,  People  magazine,
and Alaskan bitches."

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Isn't there anything else
you guys want?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
You may never get
this chance again.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Anything else?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I thought that's what
the magazine was for.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
No. I'm gonna knock
that down too.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
What about an end
to the outsourcing

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
of prison labor
to private companies?

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
I like that.
Yeah, yeah. That's not bad.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
What if we keep doing
the work

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
but they pay us
in white bitches?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
CONVICT 3:
Yo, that's crazy.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Man, white bitches.
CONVICT 4: I'd work my ass off.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Come on.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
RUCKUS:
Follow him,

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
white children.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Niggas know they way
through prison.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Best, you know what? I'd love
to be paid in white bitches.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Hey, yo, nigga!
Where the hostages?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Thank God.
Is everyone all right?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
There's a service exit
not far from here.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Aw, my precious
little white children.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I told you, y'all would be safe

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
with your Uncle Ruckus.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Ruckus, where's Huey
and Riley?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Where they belong,
with the convicts.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
You left Huey and Riley?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Course I did.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
You guys go ahead.
I've gotta go back.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Tom! Tom, are you crazy?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Tom! Stay away
from that tossed-salad guy!

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
You got peanut allergies!

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
CONVICT 1: You! I'm talking to you!

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
The booty is mine.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
It belongs to me.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
MAN:

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Ow!

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
So you wanna do it
the hard way, huh?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I got it for you hard.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Ugh!
Don't drop the soap, Tom!

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I want that booty, Tom.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
You can't have my booty.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Oh, yeah, I can.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
The booty is mine,
it belongs to me,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
you cannot take my booty.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
The booty is mine,
it belongs to me,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
you cannot take my booty.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Mm-hm.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Mm-hm, come on, Tom.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
You can't have it!

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Ah, man!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yo! Them niggas left without us.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Ain't that a bitch.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Whose job was it to watch
the motherfucking hostages?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
You forgot to assign
it to someone,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Mr. Chief Motherfucking
Executive.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Did y'all know about this?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
If we did, do you think
we'd still be here?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
What are we gonna do
with demands and no hostages?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
We got them.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Man, we won't get
any strategic leverage

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
with them two.
I motion we end the riot,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
disband the Executive
Riot Committee,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
and surrender to authorities.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Okay. All in favor
of ending the riot.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Motion passes.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
CONVICT 2:
Wait a minute,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
let me get this right.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Do the, uh,
jelly go inside your ass?

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
You know, I spend
a lot of time, you know,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
thinking about all the shit
I could've done.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
I mean, I wake up
in the morning and I think,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
I could've been
the motherfucking president.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Shit.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Nigga, I wish
things had've been different.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
I mean, I'd do anything
in the motherfucking world

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
just for things
to be different.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I guess I'm just gonna be
raping niggas' asses

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
for the rest
of my motherfucking life.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Boys! Boys, are you okay?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Yeah. Are you okay?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Yes. Heh. I'm okay.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
For the first time
in a long time, I'm okay.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Of course you okay. You ran.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
How a chaperone
gonna run, Mr. DuBois? Huh?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
"Leave the kids, save yourself?"

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Is that what chaperoning
mean to you?

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Pfft. I can't believe
this is supposed to scare me.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
A prison full
of bitch-ass niggas.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
The convicts is bitch-ass
niggas. All they did was vote.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
The COs was bitch-ass niggas,
'cause they just fell over.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
And, Tom, you's a bitch-ass
nigga too.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Because all you did was run.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
They wouldn't know what to do

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
with a real nigga like me
up in here.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Lucky for them
I'm a little kid

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
so they can't put me
in a real jail.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
They gotta put me
in a jail for, like,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
real nigga little kids.
