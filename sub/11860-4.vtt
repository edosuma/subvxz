WEBVTT

00:22.333 --> 00:23.750
(male #1)
'Brothers and sisters'

00:23.834 --> 00:26.125
look at the person
sitting next to you.

00:26.208 --> 00:29.917
Chances are,
they have a loved one

00:30.000 --> 00:32.417
fighting in Southeast Asia.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.917
'Our boys are doing everything'

00:35.000 --> 00:37.208
'to keep their souls intact
over there.'

00:37.291 --> 00:39.208
So ask yourself

00:39.291 --> 00:41.750
what are you doing over here?

00:41.834 --> 00:44.625
'When you look in the mirror
does the reflection seek'

00:44.709 --> 00:46.875
material gain from the world?

00:56.583 --> 00:57.458
Billy.

01:02.792 --> 01:04.417
I wasn't finished.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.792
Sorry, dad. Sorry.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.834
- 'He ain't bad.'
- 'Kid can really play.'

01:16.375 --> 01:20.542
What does it profit a man
to gain the whole world..

01:21.917 --> 01:23.458
...and lose his soul?

01:50.250 --> 01:54.291
So, Archie, you said your pop
was William Sanders, right?

01:54.375 --> 01:55.834
(Archie)
'William Jeremiah Sanders.'

01:55.917 --> 01:57.500
What it says
on my birth certificate.

01:57.583 --> 02:00.500
And my mom, Beatrice
passed away six months ago.

02:00.583 --> 02:02.834
Just always told me
he was a drunken bum.

02:02.917 --> 02:04.500
So, why the sudden interest?

02:04.583 --> 02:06.000
My kid came home
the other day

02:06.083 --> 02:07.750
'and asked me
to help him with this.'

02:07.834 --> 02:11.875
[chuckles]
Reminded me of when I had
the same project back in
school.

02:11.959 --> 02:13.500
Now my son is asking
about my dad.

02:13.583 --> 02:14.917
You couldn't tell him anything.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.542
Just wanna maybe find
out
somethin' about him.

02:17.625 --> 02:18.959
You know,
fill in the
blanks.

02:19.041 --> 02:20.667
So your mom told you
he was murdered?

02:20.750 --> 02:22.500
No, no. Old "Philly
Tribune"
had a blurb

02:22.583 --> 02:24.709
about a Billy Sanders
killed in 1970.

02:24.792 --> 02:26.625
'Eight months
before I was born.'

02:27.959 --> 02:31.125
Uh, tracked this down
from the Ident Unit.

02:31.208 --> 02:32.667
Looks like you.

02:36.583 --> 02:37.875
Mug shot, huh?

02:39.625 --> 02:41.125
'Guess ma was right.'

02:42.417 --> 02:44.125
What was he arrested for?

02:44.208 --> 02:47.000
Um, disorderly
conduct
outside a bar.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.875
And just the one time.
Could happen to anybody.

02:48.959 --> 02:52.583
Paper say he was killed down
on Wharton Street, 1500 Block.

02:52.667 --> 02:54.625
'Any idea what
he was doing down there?'

02:55.667 --> 02:56.750
You see the calluses?

02:56.834 --> 02:58.333
Perfectly manicured nails.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.417
- Your pop a musician?
- Don't know.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.917
Your mother ever
mention anyone else?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.750
- Dad's side of the family?
- 'Nothing.'

03:03.834 --> 03:05.291
That's why I'm here, detective.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.792
When you find anything..

03:11.500 --> 03:12.792
Sure, um..

03:14.667 --> 03:15.750
We'll let you know.

03:20.917 --> 03:22.250
Well, the dad was a reverend.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.959
Billy played the
organ
at his church.

03:24.041 --> 03:26.083
And only people interviewed
were, uh..

03:26.166 --> 03:27.834
...friends, family
from the congregation.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.375
What's a church boy
doing
hanging down

03:29.458 --> 03:31.041
on Wharton Street
at Friday night?

03:31.125 --> 03:32.417
Think I know.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.625
Ain't seen one of these
for 30 years.

03:34.709 --> 03:35.959
You got to get out more, Will.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.667
Check out the bee in the middle.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.458
'VIP pass to The Hive.'

03:41.542 --> 03:44.458
After-hours jazz spot
back in the day.

03:44.542 --> 03:47.166
Just a block
from where Billy was killed.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.500
He would have been a regular.

03:48.583 --> 03:49.959
You were
a card-carryin' member
too?

03:50.041 --> 03:51.417
[snorts]
I wish.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.375
You had a Jack of Clubs

03:54.458 --> 03:56.500
'you weren't some drunken bum,
like mom said.'

03:56.583 --> 03:59.917
You were stone-cold one of
the best musicians in town.

04:38.917 --> 04:40.250
Let you out of your cave, boss?

04:40.333 --> 04:43.500
Anything to get out
of these CompStat reports.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.125
- What you got?
- Jazz musician, 20 years
old.

04:46.208 --> 04:47.250
'Blunt-force trauma.'

04:47.333 --> 04:48.625
And, sir, no wallet on the body.

04:48.709 --> 04:51.792
ID'd from a disorderly
conduct pinch in '70.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.667
Wharton section of South
Philly.
Heavy streetwalker traffic.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.875
Well, assigned thought it
could
have been the old flimflam.

04:56.959 --> 04:59.250
- A trick gets lured in..
- Pimp cracks his skull.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.500
Takes his cash.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.166
And murder weapon looks
like a bottle.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.667
'Found dark glass shattered
near the victim.'

05:04.750 --> 05:07.208
ME assessed it matched
the wound to his skull.

05:07.291 --> 05:08.750
There's a state liquor store

05:08.834 --> 05:10.375
a block over from where
he was killed.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.083
So was The Hive,
an underground club

05:12.166 --> 05:13.500
where Billy played.

05:13.583 --> 05:16.375
Will was the after-hours
guru
back in the day.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.667
Could only go a couple times
before I got drafted.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.333
Ran every Friday,
same night Billy was
killed.

05:21.417 --> 05:23.166
I heard of this place,
it was in the basement

05:23.250 --> 05:24.417
of some house, right?

05:24.500 --> 05:27.375
Yeah, joint was hot,
smelly, crowded.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.709
But the music, man!

05:29.792 --> 05:32.875
What I would have given
to have a Jack of Clubs.

05:32.959 --> 05:35.000
Long shot, but let's check out
the bottle.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.959
See if we can track where
it might have come from.

05:37.041 --> 05:39.250
- What about next of kin?
- Reverend Thomas Sanders.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.583
Never mentioned his son
played
the clubs back in the day.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.834
You remember any of the
musicians from that place,
Will?

05:43.917 --> 05:48.917
Not by name. Owner was
a tough broad, the Queen
Bee.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.500
She'd sit at the
end
of the bar

05:50.583 --> 05:51.709
smoke like a chimney.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.875
Maybe she's still
buzzin'
around.

05:53.959 --> 05:55.917
Can tell us if Billy was
there
the night he died.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.333
And talk to the dad too.

05:57.417 --> 06:00.125
See if any of this new info
sparks a memory.

06:02.041 --> 06:04.583
I've got a kid here
who wants to see Detective
Rush.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.291
I'm her partner.
I'll talk to him.

06:08.375 --> 06:10.041
Uh, he asked for Detective Rush.

06:10.125 --> 06:11.417
(Vera)
'Hey, Scotty.'

06:13.834 --> 06:16.709
[burps]
Ooh! Something I ate.

06:16.792 --> 06:18.000
The chili fries?

06:18.083 --> 06:19.792
[groans]
Good though.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.125
Valens.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.625
Hey, mom.

06:22.709 --> 06:23.709
'Uh, just..'

06:23.792 --> 06:26.542
No reason.
Just checking in.

06:26.625 --> 06:29.166
What, I can't check on my mom?

06:29.250 --> 06:30.625
'Yeah, fine.'

06:30.709 --> 06:32.917
Okay, yeah.
Talk later.
Bye.

06:34.542 --> 06:36.750
Ran the title,
real estate files show

06:36.834 --> 06:40.000
the Queen Bee was
Geraldine Watkins back in '70.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.792
- Still around?
- Yeah.

06:41.875 --> 06:44.375
Runs a soul food joint
out of the same address today.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.125
Hey, somebody here to see me?

06:46.208 --> 06:47.875
Oh, yeah, he's right over..

07:01.041 --> 07:03.000
We played music for the Lord.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.542
Billy played an organ
the angels envied.

07:05.625 --> 07:06.834
(Vera)
'Is that Billy's brother?'

07:06.917 --> 07:09.250
Tom Jr. was going
to be a preacher

07:09.333 --> 07:11.291
in the Sanders tradition.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.709
My eldest was taken
by the jungle.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.458
My youngest, by the streets.

07:15.542 --> 07:18.250
Both jungles,
just different terrain.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.166
I served over there as well.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.667
You got something
on my son's murder?

07:21.750 --> 07:23.250
(Vera)
'We're looking into it.'

07:23.333 --> 07:25.709
Was there anyone at church
that had a problem with
Billy?

07:25.792 --> 07:27.166
On the contrary

07:27.250 --> 07:29.583
when he died, they buried him
like a king.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.291
His casket, his headstone

07:31.375 --> 07:34.333
the flowers, all courtesy
of the congregation.

07:34.417 --> 07:35.792
Any chance we could get a list

07:35.875 --> 07:37.583
of the congregation
members
back then?

07:37.667 --> 07:40.125
I'll check and see,
but why?

07:40.208 --> 07:43.542
Tom, you familiar
with The Hive?

07:43.625 --> 07:45.125
After-hours jazz club
back in the day?

07:45.208 --> 07:46.583
(Tom)
'Why would I be?'

07:46.667 --> 07:49.125
I don't associate
with those kinds of
people.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.667
Ever mention a girl
named Beatrice Sloan?

07:51.750 --> 07:53.917
What are you implying
about my son,
detective?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.792
Nothing. Just trying to find
out
what happened.

07:56.875 --> 07:59.625
Well, when his brother died..

08:00.834 --> 08:02.667
...it was rough on everyone.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.208
Me and Billy
drifted apart a
bit.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.333
He in some kind of
trouble?
Drugs, money?

08:06.417 --> 08:08.417
No, no.
Not that I knew of.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.583
I just think he may have
started
to question his faith.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.500
Know anyone
he was hanging with

08:13.583 --> 08:15.083
outside the church
before he died?

08:15.166 --> 08:16.834
I'm sorry. I don't.

08:16.917 --> 08:20.250
But may the weight of the
Lord
be on their soul.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.625
(Rush)
Hmm, check out the specials.

08:25.709 --> 08:27.375
Winning numbers
on the track today.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.375
Street lottery. Little numbers
running with your soul food?

08:30.458 --> 08:32.208
Hey, sweeties.

08:33.792 --> 08:35.291
Anywhere you'd like.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.250
Creamed chicken is to die for.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.583
Looks like a winner.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.542
Gotta say, Queen Bee,
a step up from The
Hive.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.625
Honey,
I'm an honest businesswoman.

08:43.709 --> 08:45.792
Call Vice over,
they gonna agree?

08:45.875 --> 08:48.542
[scoffs]
The Hive ain't been around
since the 70s.

08:48.625 --> 08:51.000
Well, there's no statute
of limitation on homicide.

08:51.083 --> 08:52.583
Homicide?

08:52.667 --> 08:54.083
Billy Sanders.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.375
Oh, Sanders. Yeah.

08:56.458 --> 08:58.250
Sad, 'cause he was a nice kid.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.625
Had this on him.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.417
- He here the night he died?
- Not that I remember.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.750
We're gonna need the names

09:04.834 --> 09:06.083
of who might have
been here that
night.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.959
If any of them are still alive.

09:08.041 --> 09:10.792
All those musician cats
wanted to be like Miles.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.750
They came with a nasty habit.

09:12.834 --> 09:15.959
Any of those cats
have a beef with Billy?

09:16.041 --> 09:17.959
No. Church boy?
Not at all.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.750
Oh, seems like a tight
fit
for a jazz club.

09:20.834 --> 09:21.959
They didn't mind.

09:22.041 --> 09:24.750
I had to turn folks away.
Shucks.

09:24.834 --> 09:27.792
Tons of musicians
used to roll through here.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.041
But even I was shocked

09:29.125 --> 09:32.375
the night Billy Sanders
appeared on my stage.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.667
Whoo! Where did you learn
to beat like that, kid?

09:53.750 --> 09:55.333
'Ooh!'

09:58.250 --> 10:00.083
Come on, now.
Time to get
paid.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.000
Uh-uh, gentlemen,
the bank of Geraldine

10:08.083 --> 10:09.625
doesn't give money away.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.166
You drank more than you played.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.625
No, not tonight.

10:12.709 --> 10:14.083
Don't work like that.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.375
- Hey, Miss Watkins.
- Billy?

10:29.458 --> 10:32.333
I'm gonna see you and your mom
at church on Sunday, right?

10:40.959 --> 10:42.291
Now, beat it.

10:45.208 --> 10:46.709
Hey, you alright, kid.

10:49.333 --> 10:50.792
Your father know
you're here,
Billy?

10:50.875 --> 10:53.166
No, and I'd appreciate
if we kept it that way.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.250
Sorry to hear
about your brother,
sweetie.

11:01.458 --> 11:02.667
Oh, I didn't order anything.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.875
Be careful, young man.

11:14.917 --> 11:16.750
Thanks for the drink, miss.

11:16.834 --> 11:19.500
My mother's the only
miss
in my family.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.250
You can really play those drums.

11:24.375 --> 11:25.667
I play a lot more than that.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.875
- Really?
- Yeah, I learn by ear.

11:27.959 --> 11:30.250
I mean, if I hear it,
I-I can play it.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.250
So you can hold a beat
but you can't hold your
liquor?

11:39.333 --> 11:40.959
No, well, I'm a quick learner.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.417
(male #2)
'One more coming up.'

11:50.750 --> 11:52.041
Now, who is the girl?

11:52.125 --> 11:53.750
Beatrice something.

11:53.834 --> 11:57.625
Older, but wise to the fact
that drummers keep the rhythm.

11:57.709 --> 11:59.500
- Beatrice Sloan?
- That's it.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.709
Yeah, used to work
for Ronde Brooks.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.917
Ronde Brooks
of Ronde Records?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.333
One and the same.

12:05.417 --> 12:06.834
But I always thought

12:06.917 --> 12:09.917
that Beatrice was Ronde's girl.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.875
Uh, Ronde know
about her and
Billy?

12:11.959 --> 12:13.291
You gotta ask him.

12:13.375 --> 12:14.792
Don't let the suit fool you

12:14.875 --> 12:16.583
'cause Ronde came up
in the streets

12:16.667 --> 12:19.917
and you don't get to what
he had by getting chumped.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.750
Can I get you guys anything?

12:24.834 --> 12:27.542
- Perrier?
- I'm good.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.625
I own every single
one
of these on vinyl.

12:29.709 --> 12:32.500
(Ronde)
'No kidding, you know,
I've got a lifetime
achievement'

12:32.583 --> 12:34.041
ceremony in my honor coming up.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.625
I could put aside
a couple of tickets.

12:36.709 --> 12:38.917
Thanks, but we're tied up
with Billy Sanders' murder.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.583
Billy Sanders?

12:41.667 --> 12:43.625
Yeah, I remember Billy Sanders.
Session guy.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.166
You must've been pissed
when you heard he was

12:45.250 --> 12:47.041
steppin' out with Beatrice,
knocked her up.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.250
Guys, I don't..

12:50.333 --> 12:51.834
I don't date my secretaries.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.500
Yeah, nobody with money
does that.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.834
Beatrice would go
around
to the clubs

12:56.917 --> 12:59.166
and let me know
which musicians to look
at.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.834
- Billy was one of them.
- You and Billy get along?

13:01.917 --> 13:03.792
Sure. Yeah, we got along.

13:03.875 --> 13:05.375
He had a very strict old man
though.

13:05.458 --> 13:07.458
You know, when Billy wasn't
churchin', he was workin' for
me

13:07.542 --> 13:09.667
but he asked me to pay him
under the table.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.000
[chuckles]
He wanted to keep it quiet.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.333
So, why didn't you come forward

13:12.417 --> 13:13.875
make a statement
after he was killed?

13:13.959 --> 13:16.208
I didn't even hear
about it
until a week later.

13:17.041 --> 13:18.208
Kid quit coming around.

13:18.291 --> 13:20.208
- Why's that?
- 'Why do most of 'em?'

13:20.291 --> 13:23.208
He fell to the bottle
or the needle.

13:23.291 --> 13:26.375
The one thing
I will say about Billy.

13:26.458 --> 13:30.041
Kid was all about the right
place, the right time.

13:44.959 --> 13:46.333
Whoa, whoa.
Hold it!

13:47.333 --> 13:48.458
Yo, what's that?

13:51.333 --> 13:53.166
You guys deaf?
Answer me.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.083
Um, I was playing
behind the beat.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.667
'Sounded kinda fresh,
you know.'

13:57.750 --> 13:59.250
(male #3)
Damn it, kid!

13:59.333 --> 14:01.417
Ronde, I-I'm sorry, man.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.250
I told him to stay
on the beat.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.917
Stop, stop. What he's rollin'
with sounds good.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.208
It's your drunk ass that's
always trippin' us up, punchy.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.709
Hit the road. Beat it.
Go sleep it off.

14:11.792 --> 14:12.917
You kiddin' me, man.

14:15.041 --> 14:16.291
Looks like I'm kiddin'?

14:17.583 --> 14:19.041
You, jump in.

14:21.542 --> 14:22.583
Somebody, come play bass.

14:22.667 --> 14:24.917
Behind the
beat,
like him.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.500
And with an ear like mine

14:33.583 --> 14:35.500
some things just stick out
to you.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.542
- So, who was the mess?
- That would be Buster Large.

14:38.625 --> 14:40.583
Soon after,
graduated to train wreck.

14:40.667 --> 14:43.667
- You fire him?
- Eventually had to.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.333
After Billy leapfrogged him,
the fellas gave him hell.

14:46.417 --> 14:49.667
He crawled deeper
into the bottle, junk.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.041
He blame Billy for his troubles?

14:52.333 --> 14:54.417
Ain't that what most addicts do?

14:56.125 --> 14:57.625
Excuse me, detectives.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.041
Here you go, Mr...

15:01.125 --> 15:02.542
So, Buster follows Billy home

15:02.625 --> 15:04.125
from The Hive,
bottle in hand.

15:04.208 --> 15:06.875
Cracks him over the head,
takes him out.

15:06.959 --> 15:09.917
Most expensive bottle of booze
Buster ever bought in his life.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.250
Bet you wish all our
vics
were musicians.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.291
Freakin' kid
in a candy store.

15:20.375 --> 15:23.834
(Jeffries)
'No candy store. I went
to had the O'Jays on vinyl.'

15:23.917 --> 15:25.125
Lot to choose from.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.875
You, uh, got any Spinners?

15:26.959 --> 15:28.667
Philly Soul's over there,
on wax.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.375
Buster, right?

15:30.458 --> 15:32.500
Session guy over
at Ronde Records back then.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.166
- Yeah.
- There was some other kid.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.375
Behind you on bass.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.959
- Billy Sanders?
- You guys cops?

15:38.041 --> 15:39.291
Well, we're not here
to sell insurance.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.667
You still hittin' the sauce,
Buster?

15:40.750 --> 15:42.500
- Been clean 30 years.
- 'It's all good.'

15:42.583 --> 15:44.875
But Billy was killed in 1970.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.333
I got along with
Billy
just fine.

15:46.417 --> 15:47.583
(Vera)
'Huh?'

15:47.667 --> 15:49.291
Was that before or after
he made you

15:49.375 --> 15:50.875
the laughing stock
of the swamp pit?

15:52.083 --> 15:54.250
Billy wanted that
gig,
he could have it.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.792
Ronde was a slave
driver,
anyway.

15:55.875 --> 15:58.000
Feel the same way
when you were poutin'
outside

15:58.083 --> 16:00.750
the studio after you got
canned,
looking for your job back?

16:00.834 --> 16:02.542
Look, hell, yeah, I got pissed.

16:02.625 --> 16:03.709
But I realized that

16:03.792 --> 16:06.041
Billy was just better than me.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.417
It was in his soul.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.041
And he knew what sounded good.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.542
Hey, why don't you ever
bring me no drink, Beatrice?

16:19.625 --> 16:21.625
[scoffs]
Why don't you ever pass one up?

16:23.041 --> 16:25.375
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, babe.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.458
There's a girl here
in her Sunday best.

16:27.542 --> 16:28.875
Uh, she says
she's from your church.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.208
So, I was thinkin', um

16:33.291 --> 16:35.333
maybe I could come by
your place later.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.583
Um..

16:37.667 --> 16:40.792
...that-that's
probably
not a good idea.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.375
Look, come on,
he catches me here

16:42.458 --> 16:44.125
he'll skin my hide,
let alone bring you
home.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.500
Why's he so against you
bein' here?

16:45.583 --> 16:47.250
I-I told you,
it's the way it
is.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.583
And-and it's not what
my brother would've
done.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.417
How do I look?

17:00.500 --> 17:02.125
You look great.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.625
Come on,
don't be nervous.
Relax.

17:04.709 --> 17:07.291
Ronde, this here's Chandra.

17:07.375 --> 17:08.667
The one
I was telling you about.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.041
'Got those gospel pipes.'

17:13.250 --> 17:14.375
Not now.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.041
Uh, but you said
you'd hear my friend sing.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.083
Can't you see I'm busy?

17:18.166 --> 17:19.458
Gotta get these sounds right.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.000
Yeah, well, you know you ain't
never gonna get it right

17:24.083 --> 17:25.750
if you keep copying Motown.

17:26.917 --> 17:29.000
What, what did you say?

17:29.083 --> 17:31.125
Your vocalists
got no soul

17:31.208 --> 17:33.250
no pain,
Motown's got gospels.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.250
Screw Motown, alright?
This is Philly.

17:35.333 --> 17:37.375
Then let's actually tap
into the Philly sound.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.000
Falsetto from the street
corners
we hear every day.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.625
Let's show that to the world.

17:42.709 --> 17:44.417
What do you know
about making records,
huh?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.583
I know this mono stuff is junk.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.417
We need somethin' fresh.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.667
A fuller sound than Motown
has ever imagined.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.583
Strings and horns
all on different tracks.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.625
- What are we, The Beatles?
- Why not?

17:55.709 --> 17:57.500
They it stole from us.
Let's steal it back.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.709
Okay, how about this, kid,
as soon as you can pay for
it

18:02.417 --> 18:04.083
we'll do it, deal?

18:05.375 --> 18:06.583
So then, you'll listen
to my friend?

18:06.667 --> 18:08.834
You crazy?
She ain't a front
girl.

18:08.917 --> 18:10.667
She just a
churchy
with a fat, old
ass.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.333
Chandra..

18:20.250 --> 18:21.875
That's the last I saw of him.

18:21.959 --> 18:24.041
But the thing is, he called it.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.875
Wasn't long before
Gamble and Huff took
it

18:25.959 --> 18:27.208
to a whole new level.

18:27.291 --> 18:28.667
Who was his friend?

18:28.750 --> 18:30.083
Chandra somethin',
that's all I know.

18:30.166 --> 18:31.959
Sit tight, Buster.
We may be back.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.208
(Jeffries)
'And Philly soul
was the next step from Motown.'

18:39.291 --> 18:40.792
Takes me back, man.

18:40.875 --> 18:43.834
Cruisin' in the drop-top,
Billy Paul on the eight
track.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.709
- Never heard of him.
- Come on, man.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.709
How about The Intruders?

18:47.792 --> 18:49.667
- Delfonics?
- Nope.

18:49.750 --> 18:52.458
Alright, you gotta
at least know "Love Train."

18:52.542 --> 18:54.333
Yeah, song from the
beer
commercial.

18:56.834 --> 18:58.250
You're an ass, man.

19:00.875 --> 19:03.041
Needle in a haystack
with this bottle label.

19:03.125 --> 19:05.709
State liquor store
had nothing like it in stock.

19:05.792 --> 19:08.709
So long ago, bottle might not
even be manufactured anymore.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.000
They didn't recognize it
from anything back then
either.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.959
I'll hit up the Liquor Control
Board, see what I can find.

19:14.041 --> 19:16.333
Well, this Chandra
girl,
Chandra Patterson.

19:16.417 --> 19:18.500
Name's on the list
we got from Billy's
dad.

19:20.709 --> 19:22.792
So, how come choir girl
never came forward

19:22.875 --> 19:24.291
after he was killed?

19:24.375 --> 19:27.208
Lil, you know
this kid over
here?

19:27.291 --> 19:28.917
That's the same dude
from yesterday.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.041
Uniforms picked him up
on a D&D, asked for you.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.417
Thanks.

19:36.333 --> 19:37.959
(Rush)
'Hey.'

19:38.041 --> 19:39.333
You asked for me?

19:40.417 --> 19:42.458
Uh, I did?

19:42.542 --> 19:44.333
- What's your name?
- Um..

19:44.417 --> 19:46.250
- Why did you ask for me?
- Well, downstairs..

19:46.333 --> 19:47.750
Your name's
on that board thing.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.959
Well, try again.
You came in yesterday.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.458
Give me your ID.

20:01.542 --> 20:02.917
Sean Thomason.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
'Really?'

20:04.083 --> 20:05.375
That's a pretty good fake.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.417
What do you, uh,
what do you do here?

20:10.500 --> 20:12.125
'Well, homicide. Why?'

20:13.625 --> 20:15.959
- You got info on a case?
- Homicide?

20:16.041 --> 20:17.208
Well, that's cool.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.125
- Hmm.
- How long have you worked here?

20:21.208 --> 20:22.917
What's with the
personal
questions?

20:26.208 --> 20:27.834
- Uh..
- Uh, he's a DK.

20:27.917 --> 20:30.208
'Put him downstairs.
Let him sleep it off.'

20:30.291 --> 20:31.375
Let's go.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.000
Everything cool?

20:36.083 --> 20:37.333
Well, the kid stinks.

20:37.417 --> 20:39.291
So, looks like Chandra's still
at it in the church.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.375
Only now,
she's the choir director.

20:49.291 --> 20:52.166
Billy and Tommy
were like older brothers.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.250
We'd sneak out
of church events

20:54.333 --> 20:57.500
find Motown or Stax
on the radio.

20:57.583 --> 20:59.834
(Valens)
Uh, where were you the night
Billy was killed?

20:59.917 --> 21:01.333
Home with my parents.

21:01.417 --> 21:03.583
I didn't really go out
much on the weekends.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.750
Only when you went with
Billy
to Ronde's studio.

21:05.834 --> 21:08.333
You never told the police
he worked at Ronde Records.

21:08.417 --> 21:12.083
Billy's parents lost both sons
eight months apart.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.667
I didn't wanna add
insult to injury.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.333
Well, it might have
helped
solve his murder.

21:15.417 --> 21:19.166
[sighs]
Billy changed
from the boy I knew.

21:19.250 --> 21:20.542
'He was drinking a lot.'

21:20.625 --> 21:23.125
Started losing himself
in the studio scene.

21:23.208 --> 21:24.750
But you wanted to be
in that scene.

21:24.834 --> 21:26.709
Thought I was gonna be
the next Aretha.

21:28.041 --> 21:30.750
But Ronde could care
less about gospel vocals.

21:30.834 --> 21:33.625
Well, the way we heard it,
Ronde stopped you at the
gate.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.500
No, I got my chance to shine.

21:36.583 --> 21:39.250
And it was all
because of Billy.

21:44.083 --> 21:46.875
- Where the heck is Billy?
- I'm here. I'm here.

21:46.959 --> 21:48.500
I couldn't split
organ practice early.

21:48.583 --> 21:50.875
Dad stayed the whole time.

21:50.959 --> 21:52.667
Alright, we're gonna need
separate mics.

21:52.750 --> 21:55.458
Fresh from up here, fellas.
Fresh from up here.

21:55.542 --> 21:58.291
And ladies, there you go,
there you go.

21:58.375 --> 22:00.333
- Follow my lead.
- Billy, wh-what the hell?

22:00.417 --> 22:02.750
Don't worry, you can pay me
when it's a hit.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.125
Start us off.

22:07.291 --> 22:08.875
(Billy)
'Tempo up.'

22:08.959 --> 22:10.208
Just a bit.

22:12.458 --> 22:13.750
Rhythm section.

22:17.291 --> 22:18.458
Guitar.

22:26.959 --> 22:28.291
Strings. Horns.

22:42.000 --> 22:42.959
Choir, come on now.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.041
Yeah!

23:33.375 --> 23:34.625
"The Lord is good to all

23:34.709 --> 23:37.792
and his tender mercies
are on all his works."

23:37.875 --> 23:41.166
And boy, was the Lord
good to Billy?

23:41.250 --> 23:43.333
I know that song. It
was
a pretty big hit,
huh?

23:43.417 --> 23:45.667
Sound that launched the label.

23:45.750 --> 23:49.083
[sighs]
He was Philly soul.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.959
I still have the sheet music.

23:51.041 --> 23:54.667
You know, Billy footed the
bill
for all those musicians.

23:54.750 --> 23:56.125
Where did he get that money?

23:56.208 --> 23:58.709
Well, not from what Ronde
paid him, I'll tell you that.

23:58.792 --> 24:01.000
I don't remember
a woman's voice on the track.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.959
When they recorded it,
they swapped me out

24:03.041 --> 24:06.166
for three men who sang
falsetto and could dance.

24:06.250 --> 24:09.667
Ronde's call.
That's just the way it was.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.709
Oh, Billy didn't get the
cash
from the old man.

24:11.792 --> 24:13.667
He'd never approve.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.750
Unless Billy was dipping
into the donations basket.

24:15.834 --> 24:17.250
Pass the hot sauce.

24:17.333 --> 24:21.333
Well, the father could tell us
who handled the church
finances.

24:21.417 --> 24:23.709
Hmm, if they're still alive.

24:23.792 --> 24:25.208
What's up, Will?

24:25.291 --> 24:26.625
Liner notes.

24:27.709 --> 24:29.417
'See something off, guys?'

24:29.500 --> 24:31.583
(Stillman)
'Huh, "music, lyrics,
and arrangements."'

24:31.667 --> 24:33.000
Ronde's a one-man show.

24:33.083 --> 24:34.667
Chandra said Billy
wrote
that song.

24:34.750 --> 24:37.208
So, why is Ronde getting
sole credit for the track

24:37.291 --> 24:38.375
that launched the label?

24:38.458 --> 24:40.500
Hmm, steal a
little,
you're a thief.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.709
You steal a lot, you're a king.

24:44.792 --> 24:46.542
(Rush)
'Get up, Finn Cooper.'

24:47.959 --> 24:49.834
Unless you want me
to give this to your
dad.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.542
You mean our dad?

24:56.333 --> 24:57.792
Must have really
wanted
to meet me.

24:58.917 --> 25:00.083
Yeah, I guess.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.458
Here I am.

25:11.041 --> 25:12.375
So, what do you wanna know?

25:12.458 --> 25:15.500
Just wanted to see
what you look like, okay?

25:17.500 --> 25:18.834
Did you call my dad?

25:20.291 --> 25:22.041
Not my place.

25:22.125 --> 25:23.750
You could have saw me
two days ago.

25:23.834 --> 25:25.125
Yeah, but..

25:25.208 --> 25:27.250
...there were all these
cops and people around.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.875
It's kind of
how
it is around
here.

25:29.959 --> 25:32.125
I don't know.
What was I gonna say?

25:33.875 --> 25:36.792
So, you get your load
on,
jammed up.

25:37.834 --> 25:40.041
'Well, there was easier ways.'

25:40.125 --> 25:41.500
You always drink like this?

25:41.583 --> 25:42.625
No.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.375
You know what..

25:45.458 --> 25:48.625
...it's just like,
things are one way.

25:48.709 --> 25:50.792
Then it's like,
there's this other sister.

25:55.333 --> 25:56.667
They say you might be coming by?

25:56.750 --> 25:58.834
Yeah, I mean, well..

25:58.917 --> 26:00.375
I don't know about-about that.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.583
Yeah. It's like weird, right?

26:05.500 --> 26:07.458
'So, uh..'

26:07.542 --> 26:09.083
...so, what happened
with you and Dad?

26:09.166 --> 26:10.375
What do you mean?

26:10.458 --> 26:13.625
It's like he's got this
whole other life before.

26:13.709 --> 26:15.458
But I've never even seen
a picture of the guy

26:15.542 --> 26:17.834
before he was like, 45 or so.

26:17.917 --> 26:20.500
Um, I guess there's some things
he didn't want you to know.

26:20.583 --> 26:21.875
Like what?

26:23.625 --> 26:25.542
Well, you have to ask him.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.959
Yeah, right.

26:33.917 --> 26:35.500
Need an officer
to drive you
home?

26:35.583 --> 26:37.291
- I can go?
- Don't make a habit of it.

26:37.375 --> 26:39.625
- Okay?
- Uh, yeah.

26:39.709 --> 26:41.166
No, I'll take the bus. Thanks.

26:41.250 --> 26:43.792
You know, you don't
need
to get locked up

26:43.875 --> 26:45.417
every time you wanna see me.

26:49.125 --> 26:51.000
The great Ronde Brooks.

26:51.083 --> 26:53.709
And I'm staring at those
gold records, thinkin'

26:53.792 --> 26:56.166
"Damn, if I had a tenth
of that talent."

26:57.417 --> 26:59.333
But it was Billy's talent.

26:59.417 --> 27:00.667
The real innovator.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.083
Excuse me?

27:03.291 --> 27:04.500
'Billy wrote this.'

27:04.583 --> 27:08.041
Yet I can't find
his name anywhere.

27:08.125 --> 27:10.375
That's some cold jealousy.

27:10.458 --> 27:13.166
What happened when Billy learned
you cuffed his song?

27:13.250 --> 27:15.542
Cuffed his song?

27:15.625 --> 27:20.166
You know how many people steal
my stuff and call it their own?

27:20.250 --> 27:22.125
'See, that's what
lawyers are for'

27:22.208 --> 27:24.000
and I think I'd like mine.

27:24.083 --> 27:25.375
- Now.
- 'Sure.'

27:25.458 --> 27:27.834
'Course, takes some time
to process.

27:27.917 --> 27:30.000
Lifetime achievement award.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.500
Might have to miss the ceremony.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.083
Oh, hey.

27:36.625 --> 27:37.750
Alright.

27:38.917 --> 27:40.667
So, Billy should have
gotten credit.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.041
And one thing I know,
when a guy's in trouble..

27:44.291 --> 27:46.875
...he tends to make
hasty decisions.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.083
Baltimore?

27:50.166 --> 27:51.500
You're drinking
all the time now.

27:51.583 --> 27:53.083
(Billy)
'Suddenly, you care about
that?'

27:53.166 --> 27:54.834
Things are different now, Billy.

27:56.125 --> 27:58.125
You owe cash to some
really dangerous people.

27:58.208 --> 27:59.500
That was to make the record.

27:59.583 --> 28:01.250
(Beatrice)
'You think Ronde cares?'

28:01.333 --> 28:02.834
You think he's ever
gonna pay you?

28:04.333 --> 28:05.500
You used to believe in me.

28:06.834 --> 28:10.417
I do, baby. I believe
you can do anything you want
to.

28:11.625 --> 28:13.458
But you're under Ronde's thumb.

28:13.542 --> 28:15.000
You know, and-and,
and your dad controls--

28:15.083 --> 28:16.709
You don't know
anything
about that.

28:16.792 --> 28:19.417
Well, I know you won't even
introduce me to your family

28:19.500 --> 28:21.417
'cause I'm not..

28:21.500 --> 28:23.375
...I'm not from the church.

28:27.917 --> 28:29.041
Damn it, Billy.

28:29.125 --> 28:30.875
Once I make it big,
that will all change.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.375
No, it won't.

28:35.083 --> 28:36.250
Look at you.

28:38.041 --> 28:39.542
I mean, what do you want?

28:41.917 --> 28:43.542
You wanna fill
your brother's
shoes?

28:46.291 --> 28:47.959
Do you wanna be
your own person?

28:51.083 --> 28:52.125
For us.

29:04.583 --> 29:05.917
I see.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.709
When you're ready
to be a father..

29:13.917 --> 29:15.375
...you let me know.

29:25.417 --> 29:28.333
Whoa, whoa! You break it,
you pay for it.

29:28.417 --> 29:30.041
You owe me money, Ronde.

29:32.750 --> 29:34.417
You need to get
some things in order.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.041
Give you enough so she
can go take care of it.

29:36.125 --> 29:38.250
I don't wanna take care
of it.

29:38.333 --> 29:41.458
Ronde, this is my song
on the radio. My song.

29:41.542 --> 29:43.625
And when it's picked up
nationally, it will be huge.

29:43.709 --> 29:44.709
Those are my lyrics.

29:44.792 --> 29:46.166
And my arrangements
and my music.

29:46.250 --> 29:48.875
I did not authorize
those extra
musicians.

29:48.959 --> 29:51.375
You get paid
when I get
paid.

29:51.458 --> 29:53.291
- You still work for me,
son.
- Not anymore.

29:54.750 --> 29:56.667
'Hey.'

29:56.750 --> 29:58.959
'Want out of your contract?'

29:59.041 --> 30:00.792
Pay you for the credit.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.125
Keep your mouth shut.

30:03.959 --> 30:05.417
You never have to see me again.

30:08.166 --> 30:09.834
- Ten grand.
- Five.

30:11.375 --> 30:13.125
- Not a penny more.
- Fine.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.291
I got plenty more hits in me.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.542
Did the kid help?

30:26.959 --> 30:28.417
Yeah, sure. Sure, he helped.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.834
'But he couldn't handle
his own business.'

30:30.917 --> 30:32.375
[chuckles]
Hell..

30:32.458 --> 30:35.333
I've had 13 gold records
since he died.

30:37.917 --> 30:40.417
I'm a master at what I do.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.542
You know who loaned him
the money for the orchestra?

30:42.625 --> 30:44.792
There's only one bank in
Philly
a black musician

30:44.875 --> 30:46.542
would have went to
for that kinda cash.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.709
The bank of Geraldine.

30:49.792 --> 30:52.250
The Liquor Control Board
couldn't ID our label

30:52.333 --> 30:53.875
but I got a list
of local distributors

30:53.959 --> 30:55.959
that would have shipped
the dark bottles back in 1970.

30:56.041 --> 30:57.750
Well, they can ID
it,
maybe they know

30:57.834 --> 30:58.834
where the bottle was shipped.

30:58.917 --> 30:59.875
I already sent them the label.

30:59.959 --> 31:00.917
Had an interesting chat

31:01.000 --> 31:02.250
with my buddy in Vice.

31:02.333 --> 31:03.834
Geraldine was more
than a numbers
runner.

31:03.917 --> 31:05.166
You don't say.

31:05.250 --> 31:06.291
Yeah, investigated
her
a few years back

31:06.375 --> 31:07.542
for loan sharking.

31:07.625 --> 31:09.250
Not enough to charge her,
I take it.

31:09.333 --> 31:11.333
No, but one sap they picked
up
begged to stay in lockdown.

31:11.417 --> 31:13.917
Scared her goons would break
his legs over 200 bucks.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.583
Billy owed a lot more than that.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.166
That's why he needed money
from Ronde.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.250
Maybe heading to pay her
back when he got jumped.

31:19.333 --> 31:21.458
Oh! Hey, come on, Serpico.

31:21.542 --> 31:24.208
It's your lucky day. Time
for some real detective
work.

31:28.709 --> 31:30.917
Nice to see you
again,
Queen Bee.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.959
Don't see numbers
running on the
menu.

31:33.041 --> 31:35.333
I told you everything
I know about Billy.

31:35.417 --> 31:38.166
Left out you were pretty
heavy
in the loan sharking game.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.125
Not afraid to pop some kneecaps.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.625
Billy owed you some major coin.

31:41.709 --> 31:43.542
Okay, you got a warrant?

31:43.625 --> 31:46.000
Oh, you want a
warrant?
Yeah, that's cool.

31:46.083 --> 31:47.959
Yeah, it'll just take,
say, a few weeks.

31:48.041 --> 31:50.542
In the meantime, your
friendly neighborhood
officer

31:50.625 --> 31:54.083
will stand post, make sure
business is on the up and
up.

31:54.166 --> 31:55.959
Okay, alright, listen.

31:56.041 --> 31:57.750
Billy did owe me money

31:57.834 --> 31:59.917
and he paid me back.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.625
Only his timing
couldn't have been worse.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.792
Oh, hey. Hey, wh-what
you doing here,
sweetie?

32:09.875 --> 32:11.125
Um, hey, Geraldine.

32:11.208 --> 32:13.250
I got your money, 2,500.

32:13.333 --> 32:14.583
It's all there.
You can count it.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.667
No, th-that's fine. Um, thanks.

32:21.375 --> 32:22.417
Umm..

32:24.917 --> 32:27.000
...thanks, thanks, sweetie.

32:37.917 --> 32:40.208
I've never seen Tom so shook up.

32:41.458 --> 32:43.542
I mean, he had a reputation
to protect.

32:43.625 --> 32:44.917
That's a pretty big scandal

32:45.000 --> 32:46.583
you hitting it
with the
reverend.

32:46.667 --> 32:48.333
Not my proudest moment.

32:48.417 --> 32:49.750
But being with him..

32:50.917 --> 32:52.667
...made me feel better
about myself.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.834
Tom know Billy saw
the cufflinks?

32:55.917 --> 32:58.709
I lied, said he hadn't.
Tom didn't believe me.

32:58.792 --> 33:00.500
So, he went after him?

33:00.583 --> 33:01.792
I don't know for certain.

33:01.875 --> 33:03.166
I mean, considering
what happened..

33:04.291 --> 33:05.750
...I sure hope not.

33:07.542 --> 33:10.542
Hey, Billy didn't take
from the church, but get
this.

33:10.625 --> 33:12.208
Clerk said she got
an anonymous donation

33:12.291 --> 33:14.375
right after Billy died
with orders for his
headstone.

33:14.458 --> 33:15.583
Twenty five hundred bucks.

33:15.667 --> 33:17.041
That's the exact amount
Billy had on him.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.625
Hey, found where
our label came from.

33:19.792 --> 33:21.417
Philadelphia Winery.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.667
Communal wine.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.417
Explains why our
label
wasn't in a state
store.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.709
Oh, it was shipped
to church supply shops

33:26.792 --> 33:29.417
including one down the street
from Tom's church.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.875
Father catches son
on the street

33:30.959 --> 33:32.250
and get into an argument.

33:32.333 --> 33:33.625
Dad gets the last word.

33:33.709 --> 33:35.291
Well, it looks like
that anonymous donation

33:35.375 --> 33:36.750
was made with blood money.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.000
You told us
you didn't know anything

33:44.083 --> 33:46.500
about a place
called The Hive, Tom.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.041
That's true.

33:49.125 --> 33:51.375
So you don't know anything
about Geraldine Watkins either?

33:51.458 --> 33:54.667
Miss Watkins is a
part
of the congregation.

33:54.750 --> 33:56.125
Has been for 50 years.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.500
On Sunday, sure.

33:57.583 --> 34:00.417
But you were tending flock
with a separate
congregation

34:00.500 --> 34:01.792
on the side.

34:03.667 --> 34:07.792
Believe me, I've been making
amends over that for 39 years.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.542
(Jeffries)
Recognize
this?

34:13.041 --> 34:14.792
Bottle of wine from our church.

34:14.875 --> 34:16.792
Same kind of bottle
that killed Billy.

34:16.875 --> 34:19.959
Must have hurt when he found
out
you were a liar and a cheat.

34:20.041 --> 34:21.542
Not to mention
a hypocrite,
Tom.

34:21.625 --> 34:25.583
I-I know I was flawed
as a husband and as a preacher

34:25.667 --> 34:26.834
but I loved my son.

34:26.917 --> 34:29.000
Did you go after
Billy
that night, Tom?

34:30.750 --> 34:32.500
I did.

34:32.583 --> 34:34.625
Searched all over.

34:34.709 --> 34:38.959
I only wish it would have gone
differently when I found him.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.291
I was at the house.

34:48.458 --> 34:50.458
Mother said
you packed some
things.

34:50.542 --> 34:51.959
Everything okay, son?

34:53.959 --> 34:55.166
Something on your mind?

34:59.583 --> 35:01.417
I'm leaving home, dad.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.500
I'm gonna start my life
away from your church.

35:03.583 --> 35:04.709
You'll do no such thing.

35:04.792 --> 35:06.458
The music I do,
it's not some sin.

35:07.792 --> 35:10.709
It's me. You'd know that
if you'd just listen to it.

35:10.792 --> 35:12.709
What does it profit a man
to gain the whole world--

35:12.792 --> 35:14.291
The whole world
and lose his soul?

35:14.375 --> 35:15.667
I can quote scripture too.

35:15.750 --> 35:16.917
I just see things different.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
What I do, it's like
my own sermon, you know?

35:21.458 --> 35:23.208
How dare you disgrace me
like this?

35:23.291 --> 35:26.041
- How am I disgracing you?
- Hanging with that element.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.542
Going around town,
borrowin' money.

35:28.625 --> 35:30.250
How do you know about that, huh?

35:31.542 --> 35:32.625
From Geraldine?

35:34.417 --> 35:36.750
You've got no right to
question
me, boy. I'm your father.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.375
Then act like it for once.

35:41.291 --> 35:42.709
Your brother's
lookin' down on you
now.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.709
I'm not Tommy.
Don't you get it?

35:44.792 --> 35:46.291
He told me he was glad
that he got drafted.

35:46.375 --> 35:47.709
Don't you talk
about your
brother.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.542
So he could get away from you.

35:49.625 --> 35:50.959
They took the wrong son.

35:58.458 --> 35:59.792
You judge me..

36:01.417 --> 36:03.625
...but your preaching
is as empty as your soul.

36:11.166 --> 36:15.417
The sins of the father
do visit the son.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.750
What did you do
after Billy left,
Tom?

36:17.834 --> 36:19.875
Went home to my wife.

36:21.166 --> 36:22.542
Couldn't even look her
in the eye.

36:22.625 --> 36:24.750
(Vera)
'One thing
keeps troubling us.'

36:24.834 --> 36:27.417
A stranger makes a donation
for Billy's headstone

36:27.500 --> 36:29.125
and you're cool with it?

36:29.208 --> 36:31.709
That headstone was gorgeous.

36:31.792 --> 36:35.250
It was inscribed with Psalm 145.

36:35.333 --> 36:37.917
"The Lord is good to all

36:38.000 --> 36:39.500
and his tender mercies--"

36:39.583 --> 36:42.542
"Are on all his works."

36:42.625 --> 36:45.333
Whoever did that
knew my son better than
me.

36:46.709 --> 36:48.917
All he wanted was my acceptance.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.375
And I couldn't give it to him.

36:52.458 --> 36:54.625
(Jeffries)
'Billy has a son
who wants to meet you.'

36:57.000 --> 36:59.083
Maybe now, you got
a second chance.

37:01.709 --> 37:04.083
Who else had access
to the wine, Tom?

37:05.917 --> 37:08.458
We heard it was
the choir director.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.333
Still is.

37:10.417 --> 37:12.750
(Valens)
'We got this at the church.'

37:12.834 --> 37:14.041
Who's that..

37:14.125 --> 37:16.375
...listed as the choir
director
from '70 to '71?

37:17.834 --> 37:19.875
Delia Patterson.

37:19.959 --> 37:21.583
You don't recognize
your own mother, Chandra?

37:21.667 --> 37:24.333
What does any of this have
to do with Billy?

37:24.417 --> 37:27.083
It was exciting being
at
the studio with Billy,
huh?

37:27.166 --> 37:30.250
- The one time, yeah, but--
- It wasn't for you.

37:30.333 --> 37:34.583
[sighs]
I always just felt better
in the church.

37:34.667 --> 37:37.458
But we got the contracts
from Ronde's office.

37:37.542 --> 37:39.750
You didn't leave your backup
gig like you told us.

37:39.834 --> 37:42.000
Uh, you were fired
about a week after Billy
died.

37:42.083 --> 37:45.125
That's why you dedicated
your talents to the church.

37:45.208 --> 37:47.709
You might have had the talent,
but you didn't have the look.

37:47.792 --> 37:50.458
You know, you were only there in
the first place 'cause of Billy.

37:50.542 --> 37:53.083
Without him, you were nothin'.

37:53.166 --> 37:55.417
In fact, you were always
overlooked.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.500
By Ronde, then by Billy--

37:57.583 --> 37:59.208
Billy never overlooked me.

37:59.291 --> 38:01.291
(Rush)
'Lot of pressure on Billy.'

38:01.375 --> 38:04.750
The church, the studio, I'm sure
trying to help you added to it.

38:04.834 --> 38:07.000
Good thing he had support
from someone like Beatrice.

38:07.083 --> 38:08.834
What? Why?

38:08.917 --> 38:10.166
Well, she loved him.

38:10.250 --> 38:11.500
Love? Please.

38:11.583 --> 38:12.834
She didn't even know him.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.458
Paid for his headstone
after he died.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.125
She didn't pay for
it.
I..

38:18.125 --> 38:20.000
I kept hearing
about this headstone.

38:20.083 --> 38:21.792
Wanted to see it for ourselves.

38:22.875 --> 38:24.667
(Rush)
'"The Lord is good to all'

38:24.750 --> 38:28.041
and his tender mercies
are on all his works."

38:28.125 --> 38:29.417
Psalm 145.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.667
An ode to Billy.
Your atonement.

38:32.750 --> 38:34.333
'Now, how did you pay
for it, Chandra?'

38:34.417 --> 38:37.333
With the exact amount Billy
had
on him when he was killed?

38:37.417 --> 38:39.709
And the groundskeeper
at the cemetery..

38:39.792 --> 38:41.291
...says you were there
at least once a month.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.333
[sobbing]
I loved
Billy.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.041
Ever since I was little..

39:00.709 --> 39:02.291
...he was there for me.

39:02.375 --> 39:04.583
And when Billy needed you..

39:04.667 --> 39:06.291
...you were there for him,
weren't you?

39:10.208 --> 39:11.458
He called.

39:13.250 --> 39:16.750
Said he needed a
ride
to the bus station.

39:22.250 --> 39:24.333
You don't understand.

39:27.417 --> 39:30.417
I couldn't lose him.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.917
He was the only one
who believed in me.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.792
Ooh! Thought I'd have
to walk the whole way.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.041
I owe you tons.

39:39.125 --> 39:40.625
Oh, it's not a problem.

39:40.709 --> 39:42.875
Why you jumping to get
to the bus station
anyway?

39:42.959 --> 39:45.166
Gotta get to Baltimore.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.458
I finally stood up
to my old man, Chandra.

39:47.542 --> 39:48.709
'I'm gonna move out on my own.'

39:48.792 --> 39:50.125
- Really?
- And look.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.291
I told Ronde to kiss my ass..

39:53.375 --> 39:55.250
[chuckles]
...and he actually paid me.

39:56.333 --> 39:57.625
You shove it, Ronde.

39:59.417 --> 40:02.208
But you're still gonna work
for him though, right?

40:02.291 --> 40:04.041
What? No.

40:04.125 --> 40:06.333
I'm gonna do my own thing.

40:06.417 --> 40:09.625
But you're the only
one
promoting me there.

40:09.709 --> 40:13.166
[chuckles]
You said we were gonna make
a record together.

40:14.083 --> 40:15.458
'I believed you, Billy.'

40:16.667 --> 40:18.542
A-and we can someday.

40:18.625 --> 40:21.083
Someday? When?

40:21.166 --> 40:24.208
Without you around,
I'm just a ghost.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.583
You can't just leave.

40:26.667 --> 40:28.000
I have to.

40:28.083 --> 40:29.667
I'm gonna go get Beatrice
and bring her back here.

40:29.750 --> 40:31.250
- So we can start a label--
- Beatrice?

40:31.333 --> 40:33.000
You know, it's because of her
that I'm, I-I..

40:33.083 --> 40:34.542
I have the guts to do all this.

40:34.625 --> 40:36.375
Because of her?

40:36.458 --> 40:39.875
Some a-assistant wants to leech
off of you

40:39.959 --> 40:42.166
'cause she knows
you'll be something?

40:42.250 --> 40:43.709
'No, it's not
like that at all.'

40:43.792 --> 40:46.375
- She believes in me.
- I believe in you.

40:49.041 --> 40:50.542
She's pregnant.

40:50.625 --> 40:51.834
'And I wanna be with her.'

40:51.917 --> 40:53.500
This is something
that I need to do.

40:56.333 --> 40:57.834
No.

40:57.917 --> 40:59.041
No.

40:59.125 --> 41:02.792
[gasping]
We make, we make magic, Billy.

41:02.875 --> 41:04.667
You know, you know
what I can do.

41:04.750 --> 41:06.208
- You're the only one.
- Chandra, calm down.

41:06.291 --> 41:08.375
You said-you said
we were gonna make
it--

41:08.458 --> 41:10.041
- You just calm down.
- Together.

41:10.125 --> 41:11.375
It will be okay.
You're great.

41:11.458 --> 41:13.208
We'll make a record someday.

41:15.291 --> 41:17.041
This is not about the record.

41:20.041 --> 41:21.125
I'm sorry.
