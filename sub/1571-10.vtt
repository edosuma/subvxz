MAN (over TV):
We now return to <i>An Early Draft</i>

00:37.004 --> 00:39.204
<i>of A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:42.975
Deb? Deb!

00:42.977 --> 00:46.011
Debbie!

00:46.013 --> 00:47.312
Good night, Lois.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.148
Sorry about hitting
you at dinner.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.316
It was nice of the manager
not to call the cops.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.684
Yeah, it worked out.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.219
Happy anniversary.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.188
STEWIE:
Hey, hey!

00:56.190 --> 00:57.523
I can't remember if I'm supposed

00:57.525 --> 00:59.258
to sleep on my stomach
or my back.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.226
What does
the current literature say?

01:01.228 --> 01:02.694
Peter, go check
on Stewie.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.763
Fine.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.032
Oh, my God, look at you.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.267
You're out of breath.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.769
It's 15 feet
from your door to mine.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.204
Aw, what's the matter, Stewie?

01:12.206 --> 01:13.572
You a little scared in here?

01:13.574 --> 01:15.374
Don't worry,
there's no monsters.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.909
Of course there's
no monsters.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.343
Or are you worried
about what happened

01:18.345 --> 01:19.912
to that family
down the street?

01:19.914 --> 01:22.281
Those three guys broke in,
beat up the father

01:22.283 --> 01:24.383
with a croquet mallet,
and then stole the baby,

01:24.385 --> 01:26.418
and nobody knows
where the baby is now?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.087
Is that what you're
thinking about, buddy?

01:28.089 --> 01:29.588
I am now!

01:29.590 --> 01:32.391
Tell you what, Daddy'll
read you a bedtime story.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.759
Ah, let's see.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.761
Dr. Seuss, <i>Peter Rabbit...</i>

01:35.763 --> 01:38.764
Ah, here we go,
James Michener's <i>Hawaii.</i>

01:38.766 --> 01:40.966
Let's skip three feet in.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.901
Aah, Pearl Harbor!

01:42.903 --> 01:44.736
Okay, let's see, uh...

01:44.738 --> 01:45.771
Ah, here we go.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.773
<i>Fairy Tales.</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:50.709
Oh, not on your lap.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.312
Aah, gross!

01:53.314 --> 01:55.247
"Jack and the Beanstalk."

01:55.249 --> 01:57.749
Now, that title could be
a fairy tale or a porn.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.885
Let's find out.

02:08.928 --> 02:11.163
Jack, we need to put
food on the table.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.498
Oh, give me a break, Wife.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.333
You know, if you could
spin straw into gold

02:14.335 --> 02:16.568
or-or maybe meth,
I wouldn't need a job.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.836
Well, then, sell the cow!

02:17.838 --> 02:19.972
And be sure you get
real money for it.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.340
What else would I get?

02:21.342 --> 02:23.342
I don't know-- magic beans?

02:23.344 --> 02:24.843
There are magic beans?

02:24.845 --> 02:25.844
I don't know.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.246
Who cares?

02:27.248 --> 02:29.014
Well, what's
magic about them?

02:29.016 --> 02:31.183
Don't get magic
beans, you idiot.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.751
What? I-I'd never
even freaking heard

02:32.753 --> 02:34.353
of magic beans
till you said them.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.089
If I do get them,
it's you what caused it.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.362
So, you're selling me?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.297
Yeah, well, you heard
her back there.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.800
She wants her stupid magic beans
so the whole world has to stop.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.169
Halt, travelers!

02:50.171 --> 02:51.436
Oh, my God!

02:51.438 --> 02:52.871
Why do you look like that?

02:52.873 --> 02:55.340
Ah, all of these stories
were written by Germans.

02:55.342 --> 02:58.477
But nobody can cross my bridge
without paying a toll.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.945
A toll? Like what?

02:59.947 --> 03:01.847
You have to name three
great Jewish athletes

03:01.849 --> 03:04.449
or pay a thousand
gold coins.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.652
Uh, Hank Greenberg,

03:06.654 --> 03:08.187
Sandy Koufax

03:08.189 --> 03:10.222
and, uh, Gal Fridman,

03:10.224 --> 03:11.790
Olympic windsurfer.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.058
Took gold in Athens in 2000

03:13.060 --> 03:14.893
and the bronze
in Atlanta in '96.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.895
I can see you're
on your phone.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.664
Oh, come on,
I'm supposed to go into town

03:18.666 --> 03:19.998
and sell this cow.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.700
Ooh, you're selling that cow?

03:21.702 --> 03:25.037
I don't have much, but I'll give
you some magic beans for it.

03:26.673 --> 03:30.242
(gasps) That's exactly
what I was supposed to get!

03:31.211 --> 03:33.412
I said <i>not</i> magic beans.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.347
Look, le-let's
just admit we both

03:35.349 --> 03:36.848
kind of got our
wires crossed,

03:36.850 --> 03:39.184
and commit to being
clearer in the future.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.587
Jack, I'm sick of your
irresponsible behavior.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.089
Like when you were supposed
to be babysitting Georgie Porgie

03:44.091 --> 03:46.592
and his sleazy brother
Rick Porgie.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.261
Hey, Rick, you want to kiss
some girls and make them cry?

03:49.263 --> 03:52.664
No, but let's thumb-blast them
and make them puke.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.900
What the hell are we supposed
to do with these anyway?

03:54.902 --> 03:57.169
I knew you'd be mad, so
I've asked the band Heart

03:57.171 --> 04:00.239
to explain these beans in a
way you can dreamily digest.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.507
♪ These beans

04:02.509 --> 04:06.511

when it's cold outside. ♪

04:18.292 --> 04:21.860
They changed the word
"dreams" to "beans."

04:21.862 --> 04:24.563
I-I was hoping they'd
change a few more words

04:24.565 --> 04:26.298
to pertain to our situation,

04:26.300 --> 04:28.533
but I-I-I'm just
happy they did this.

04:28.535 --> 04:29.801
Jack, this is ridiculous.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.737
Tomorrow I want you
to go back out there

04:31.739 --> 04:34.439
and look for a job
that pays actual money.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.475
These things are worthless.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.545
I know she's gone,
but can you do the other one?

04:40.547 --> 04:42.648

04:42.650 --> 04:46.985

Holy crap!

05:15.748 --> 05:17.683
Oh, my God!

05:17.685 --> 05:19.284
Wha-What is that?

05:19.286 --> 05:22.521
I think those magic beans
grew into a giant beanstalk.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.256
Hey, where the hell'd
that thing come from?

05:24.258 --> 05:26.758
It's blocking my view of
Little Miss Muffet's tuffet.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.927
MISS MUFFET:
Ooh, isn't my tuffet soft

05:28.929 --> 05:30.829
and pink and wonderful?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.631
Ah, damn it!
I need to see that

05:32.633 --> 05:34.299
so I can make curds and whey.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.767
Relax, Rumpleforeskin.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.437
This is a magic beanstalk
that grew overnight.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.638
And I'm gonna climb it.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.106
Jack, what are you
talking about?

05:41.108 --> 05:42.774
You can't climb all
the way up there.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.276
I have to.

05:44.278 --> 05:46.178
My old gym coach is over there
with a whistle.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.179
(whistle blows)

05:47.181 --> 05:48.947
Come on, Jack,
your brother was

05:48.949 --> 05:50.515
varsity beanstalk climbing.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.884
(crying):
He's dead!

06:04.130 --> 06:06.865
And now to throw
this handful of change down

06:06.867 --> 06:09.801
because I'm a psychopath.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.036
QUAGMIRE:
Aah, damn it!

06:11.038 --> 06:13.071
MORT:
Thank you!

06:13.073 --> 06:14.740
(grunting)

06:14.742 --> 06:17.242
STEWIE: I say, who the
devil are you? Go away!

06:17.244 --> 06:18.477
Aw, I-I'm sorry.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.011
Are you taking
a goose poop?

06:20.013 --> 06:21.747
I'm not defecating,
you nitwit.

06:21.749 --> 06:22.814
I'm laying an egg.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.083
(grunting)

06:27.487 --> 06:29.588
(gasps)
Golden eggs!

06:29.590 --> 06:31.156
Oh, my God!

06:31.158 --> 06:32.724
This is probably
what famous black rappers

06:32.726 --> 06:35.560
eat for breakfast.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.596
CHRIS:
Who goes there?!

06:37.598 --> 06:40.432
Oh, boy.
You woke up dum-dum.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.202
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

06:44.204 --> 06:47.939
I smell the blood
of an English man.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.609
It's odd that you would speak
gibberish of your own choosing

06:50.611 --> 06:52.377
and not make it rhyme.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.945
How did you get here?

06:53.947 --> 06:55.046
By beanstalk.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.348
How did you get up here?

06:56.350 --> 06:58.283
This is just a house
floating in the air.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.885
I fell from a higher cloud.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.887
That is not what happened.
H-He's out of his mind.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.623
He just sits in his room all
day and inhales hair spray.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.925
Well, you can't have my goose.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.127
Okay, two men
fighting over me.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.729
Neat.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.397
All right, we're just gonna
have to quietly run away.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.899
I'll create a diversion.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.233
Aah! Look at me!

07:15.235 --> 07:16.568
Look at me! Look at me!

07:16.570 --> 07:17.869
Aah!

07:39.492 --> 07:40.826
Damn beanstalk.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.461
Hey, Little Boy Brown!

07:42.463 --> 07:44.129
You said you were
gonna help me saw.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.997
CLEVELAND: I can't
find no gloves!

07:49.435 --> 07:51.536
(grunts) Aah!

08:04.750 --> 08:06.251
Aah!

08:11.457 --> 08:13.959
Jack six, giant zero.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.495
What? What? Why-why
is that six points?

08:16.497 --> 08:18.029
Oh, Jack, you're safe.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.664
I was so worried.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.199
And I got this golden goose.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.201
Our troubles are over.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.103
Well, our-our money
troubles are over.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.740
Our sexual troubles are still...
are still very much alive.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.816
Now we wait.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.284
"The end."

08:39.286 --> 08:41.219
So, the lesson there is
if you steal,

08:41.221 --> 08:43.188
you better be ready
to murder, too.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.390
What do you say
we read another one?

08:45.392 --> 08:48.226
Wow, you got a great view
into Bonnie's window from here.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.362
Man, how do you get
any work done?

08:50.364 --> 08:52.297
What do you mean?
Lois is prettier than Bonnie.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.632
Oh, I get it.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.833
It's worse, but it's different.

08:54.835 --> 08:55.967
Okay, all right,
so that's something.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.202
Okay.

09:03.009 --> 09:05.343
So I got out of the
car to take a leak,

09:05.345 --> 09:07.078
because I'd been drinking,
and I didn't know

09:07.080 --> 09:08.547
it was next to a
children's park.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.881
But anyway, that's
why this lady

09:09.883 --> 09:12.017
has to watch whenever
I play with you.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.485
Both hands
on the book, please.

09:13.487 --> 09:15.520
It's my son!
Come on!

09:15.522 --> 09:16.521
Geez!

09:16.523 --> 09:18.189
Thank you, Maya.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.560
All right, the next story is
"Little Red Riding Hood."

09:21.562 --> 09:23.795
(birds chirping)

09:25.932 --> 09:28.033
<i>Red Riding Hood</i>
<i>was choosing her clothes</i>

09:28.035 --> 09:30.502
<i>for a journey</i>
<i>across the forest.</i>

09:30.504 --> 09:31.736
You know, if I had the guts,

09:31.738 --> 09:33.371
I would be
Little White Turtleneck.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.373
And by "guts," I mean "body."

09:35.375 --> 09:39.177
Red, don't forget this basket
of food for Grandma.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.079
This whole thing is
way too heavy.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.214
Wh-Why are you putting
a bag of ice in here?

09:43.216 --> 09:46.451
Is this... is this
a Coors Party Ball?

09:46.453 --> 09:47.752
Is Grandma going
to be entertaining

09:47.754 --> 09:49.788
Florida Jet Ski people?

09:49.790 --> 09:52.390
Remember, stay on the path
and you'll be fine.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.593
Oh, yes, great advice
from mother of the year.

09:54.595 --> 09:58.363
You do realize Grandma
lives 68 miles away, right?

09:58.365 --> 10:01.032
You-you're sending your
child out there to die.

10:04.136 --> 10:05.770
♪ Tra-la-la-la-la

10:05.772 --> 10:08.039

10:12.946 --> 10:15.747
Really? Because I hear
your son is a sap.

10:15.749 --> 10:16.982
(laughs)

10:16.984 --> 10:18.416
If you're gonna
hit the king,

10:18.418 --> 10:20.652
you better kill the king.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.095
(roars)

10:30.097 --> 10:31.162
Oh, hey.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.564
You're the wolf, right?

10:32.566 --> 10:34.132
BRIAN:
Yup, and don't forget
"big" and "bad."

10:34.134 --> 10:35.800
(growls)

10:35.802 --> 10:37.168
(chuckles) Nah.

10:39.839 --> 10:43.174
So, um, what happened with you
and those three little pigs?

10:43.176 --> 10:45.143
Wh-Why did you want
to eat them so badly?

10:45.145 --> 10:48.446
It-it's so amazing that that's
what people think happened.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.615
First of all, I didn't want
to eat them, all right?

10:50.617 --> 10:52.017
I wanted to talk
to one of them.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.151
About what?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.352
Well, she was
my ex-girlfriend,

10:54.354 --> 10:56.821
and I believed
I was due an explanation

10:56.823 --> 10:59.090
about why she was
such a (bleep) whore.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.859
All right, well, I'm
off to my grandmother's,

11:00.861 --> 11:03.528
but before I go, I better
take a deep-woods dump.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.031
Her bathroom is right
off the dining room.

11:06.033 --> 11:10.168
So, it's either now
or three days from now.

11:13.205 --> 11:14.706
Where are you going, dear?

11:14.708 --> 11:17.008
I got to go check
on my shoe apartment complex.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.778
Old woman breeds
like a gopher.

11:19.780 --> 11:23.048
(lively music playing)

11:23.849 --> 11:25.884
Hello?
Is anyone home?

11:25.886 --> 11:28.620
CONSUELA:
Ay, no, no.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.856
I can hear
the muffled Mexican music.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.626
Look, if you guys
don't shape up,

11:34.628 --> 11:35.827
I'm gonna rent this place

11:35.829 --> 11:38.129
to Goldilocks
and the three bears.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.031
Ooh, this is nice.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.734
It's every bit as
darling as you said.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.903
They're gonna
fix up the place.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.674
(knocking)

11:49.676 --> 11:51.309
Who is it?

11:51.311 --> 11:53.211
(imitating Stewie):
It's your granddaughter, Red.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.813
How do I know it's you?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.514
Oh, come on, that's
a perfect imitation.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.884
Open up. I brought strawberry
shortcake and Cool Whip.

11:59.886 --> 12:00.919
And what?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.487
Oh, sorry.
I mean Cool Hwhip.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.223
That's my little girl.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.426
Oh, my!
(growling)

12:08.428 --> 12:09.527
(roars)

12:09.529 --> 12:11.796
(wolf howling)

12:13.199 --> 12:14.399
(knocking)

12:14.401 --> 12:16.568
(high-pitched voice):
Come in.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.169
Who the hell are you?

12:18.171 --> 12:19.871
Why, your grandma,
of course.

12:19.873 --> 12:20.939
All right, fine.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.207
I guess we're doing this.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.743
My, what big eyes
you have, Grandma.

12:24.745 --> 12:27.178
All the better
to see you with, my dear.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.880
My, what big...
You know what?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.215
I-I'm sorry, I-I can't.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.550
I-I can't do this.
I-I'm not an idiot.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.085
My grandma is a human woman.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.854
How-how was this ever a scene?

12:35.856 --> 12:37.055
All right, fine, yes.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.256
It's me, the wolf.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.691
Must we go through
this charade?

12:39.693 --> 12:40.925
It's insulting.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.260
I don't know
why you're complaining.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.561
I'm the one who's about

12:43.563 --> 12:45.296
to get violently bisected
by the woodsman.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.132
What woodsman?
(chain saw buzzing nearby)

12:47.134 --> 12:50.101
Ha-ha!

13:00.446 --> 13:02.781
You know, I'm not sure
if that's our hero

13:02.783 --> 13:04.115
or just a lunatic

13:04.117 --> 13:05.617
going house to house
murdering people.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.152
PETER:
Ha-ha!

13:07.154 --> 13:08.153
(chain saw buzzing)

13:08.155 --> 13:10.288
(man screaming)

13:10.290 --> 13:11.489
(thud)

13:11.491 --> 13:12.891
Yeah, he-he-he
just did it again.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.159
I think we should...

13:14.161 --> 13:16.327
I think we should call somebody.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.904
Aw, look at the little guy.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.839
So peaceful.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.340
Hey! Wake up! We got one more!

13:29.342 --> 13:30.975
(Stewie yells)

13:30.977 --> 13:33.478
Now, if this don't get you
to sleep, nothing will.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.815
"Cinderella"
by nobody remembers.

13:38.851 --> 13:41.753
<i>A long time ago,</i>
<i>in a magical, faraway land,</i>

13:41.755 --> 13:45.290
<i>several women lived together</i>
<i>and, surprise, surprise,</i>

13:45.292 --> 13:47.592
<i>they didn't exactly get along.</i>

13:49.628 --> 13:52.330
Hey, Cinderella,
how's the scrubbing going?

13:52.332 --> 13:55.099
God, we have so few female
characters to work with.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.968
You just keep scrubbing
that poo spot

13:56.970 --> 13:59.204
so I can come back
and poo on that spot again.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.207
You guys are gonna regret
being mean to me someday.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.842
Mean to you? Us?

14:03.844 --> 14:06.377
When are we ever
mean to you?

14:06.379 --> 14:08.313
Remember the time
you told King Midas

14:08.315 --> 14:10.014
to go to third base with me?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.850
Now I'm dealing with this.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.318
(metal dinging)

14:13.320 --> 14:15.553
I dated him, too.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.963
It's so unfair that we're called
the "evil" stepsisters.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.031
Yeah, I mean,
you'd be evil, too,

14:27.033 --> 14:29.033
if your stepdad was
Bruce Jenner.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.537
Hey, girls, feel my cheek,
it's like a bottom!

14:32.539 --> 14:34.572
(plays fanfare)

14:34.574 --> 14:36.374
He stole me horn!

14:36.376 --> 14:38.576
(plays off-key)

14:39.812 --> 14:41.512
Well, I don't,
I don't know what that was,

14:41.514 --> 14:44.082
but th-the first one has
a parchment from the Charmings.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.384
(gasps)

14:46.386 --> 14:48.253
It's an invite to a party
for the prince!

14:48.255 --> 14:49.754
I hear he's looking
for someone

14:49.756 --> 14:51.155
to spend the rest
of his life with.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.857
Well, it won't be you.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.560
Yeah, there's a reason this
story's not called "Cinderella."

14:55.562 --> 14:56.995
Actually, it is.

14:56.997 --> 15:00.098
Ah, that does not
bode well for us.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.271
Now, since we're all
planning on drinking,

15:06.273 --> 15:08.373
I called us a pumpkin.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.774
LOIS:
Wait for me!

15:13.212 --> 15:15.380
You said, if I had
a nice dress,

15:15.382 --> 15:16.781
I could go to the ball.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.050
How did you even make
that dress so fast?

15:19.052 --> 15:21.519
Oh, you know,
I-I have an eye for fashion,

15:21.521 --> 15:23.755
and I'm pretty good
with my hands.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.290
Unbelievable.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.358
Now I'm worried about that
screenplay we gave her.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.960
You're not going
to the ball!

15:28.962 --> 15:31.863
It's for ladies,
not scumbag nobodies.

15:31.865 --> 15:35.633
Girls, shred her dress and
divvy it up for monthlies.

15:40.906 --> 15:43.975
(laughs)

15:45.377 --> 15:46.644
(crying)

15:46.646 --> 15:49.247
(all laughing)

15:49.249 --> 15:51.149
Well, that's
not cool, either.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.984
They're all kind of bitches.

15:56.655 --> 16:00.124
And then they ripped up my dress
so now I have nothing to wear.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.294
Well, sometimes
"nothing to wear" is a fun time.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.496
You know, just get weird.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.568
Cinderella, I am
your fairy godmother.

16:10.570 --> 16:14.272
"Fairy" in the magical sense,
not about kissing guys.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.074
Oh, my God!

16:16.076 --> 16:19.077
I want that bitch Snow White to
just admit she had an abortion.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.478
Whoa, whoa!

16:20.480 --> 16:22.780
I was thinking more like
a new dress for the party.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.415
Or a bunch of chew toys.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.583
Your choice.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.951
Chew toys.
Take the chew toys.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.319
A new dress?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.688
Well, that means I
could go to the ball!

16:35.260 --> 16:37.595
Oh, what a beautiful dress.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.297
B-But how will I
get to the ball?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.866
I-I don't have a horse
or a carriage.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.672
(grunting)

16:47.674 --> 16:50.341
Oh, yeah, that's... yeah,
just change me into whatever.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.876
Yeah, that's cool. Thanks.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.678
Well, is everything
all right in here...?

16:53.680 --> 16:57.348
(yells)
This hurts! This hurts!

17:06.859 --> 17:08.493
This ball is kind of lame.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.295
All these royal types
are inbreeding, walleyed,

17:11.297 --> 17:13.564
bucktooth monsters
who have to be wheeled around

17:13.566 --> 17:14.699
under a blanket.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.568
I say! Wherever is Grandmum-mum?

17:17.570 --> 17:20.872
She would so enjoy
the festoonities!

17:20.874 --> 17:22.240
That's not a word, sir.

17:22.242 --> 17:25.376
My mind races from the damp!

17:25.378 --> 17:26.644
Hey, how are you?

17:26.646 --> 17:28.679
Hey, hi, there.
Thanks for coming.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.916
These are my daughters,
and they will do anything

17:31.918 --> 17:34.986
to be your princess,
right, girls?

17:34.988 --> 17:36.487
See anything
you like?

17:36.489 --> 17:39.057
Oh, I'm so fancy
and moist.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.525
Ew, you guys are gross.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.094
But stick around in case
I don't find anyone else.

17:48.767 --> 17:52.003
Okay, first of all,
obviously the dress.

17:52.005 --> 17:53.337
Wow.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.373
And you smell slightly
less worse

17:55.375 --> 17:57.175
than everyone else
in the kingdom.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.777
Oh, why, thank you,
I just bathed last year.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.080
♪

18:19.531 --> 18:22.200
(bell ringing)

18:23.936 --> 18:25.069
(gasps)

18:25.071 --> 18:26.404
Hey, wh-where you going?

18:26.406 --> 18:27.371
Come back here!

18:27.373 --> 18:28.739
You brushed up against it!

18:28.741 --> 18:30.708
You got to take care of it now!

18:39.818 --> 18:42.687
Wait, wait, you forgot
your glass slipper.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.058
And a box of condoms.

18:47.060 --> 18:50.161
Aw, man!
Things were gonna happen.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.069
We almost kissed.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.471
Why couldn't the magic have
lasted five more minutes?

19:00.473 --> 19:03.508
Now I'll never get to be
a rich, do-nothing wife.

19:03.510 --> 19:07.178
Sorry your dreams
haven't come true.

19:13.785 --> 19:16.587
My lord, there is no sign
of her, and we searched far.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.523
Did you search wide?
No.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.992
You got to search wide,
that's like half of it.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.094
(neighs)

19:23.096 --> 19:25.329
PETER:
<i>And so the prince searched</i>
<i>all over the kingdom</i>

19:25.331 --> 19:27.031
<i>for the foot</i>
<i>that fit the glass slipper.</i>

19:27.033 --> 19:28.533
<i>Well, not "all" over.</i>

19:28.535 --> 19:31.469
<i>He skipped the, uh,</i>
<i>south side of town,</i>

19:31.471 --> 19:33.271
<i>which, uh, even</i>
<i>in fairy tale times,</i>

19:33.273 --> 19:35.173
<i>was, um...</i>

19:35.175 --> 19:37.441
<i>let's just say "loud."</i>

19:41.146 --> 19:44.315
And so, whoever fits in this
slipper will be my princess.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.184
Or prince.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.885
I'm bi.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.854
Oh, there's my slipper!

19:49.856 --> 19:51.355
Oh, I've been looking
all over for it.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.158
Well, when I'm not
doing gymnastics.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.060
This could be your life.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.062
LOIS: Enough!
(gasps)

20:00.032 --> 20:01.299
It's you.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.900
ALL THREE:
Her?

20:13.312 --> 20:16.147
I can't wait to make love
to you a hundred years

20:16.149 --> 20:19.550
before the invention
of toilet paper.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.520
<i>And so, two people who danced</i>
<i>together one time</i>

20:22.522 --> 20:25.489
<i>entered into an ill-advised,</i>
<i>long-term relationship.</i>

20:25.491 --> 20:28.426
<i>And they lived happily ever</i>

20:28.428 --> 20:31.162

20:32.765 --> 20:34.665

20:45.377 --> 20:48.613
Good night, Stewie.

Good night, Chris.
