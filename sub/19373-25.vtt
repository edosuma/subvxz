Looks like all
the coconuts are gone.

02:06.409 --> 02:07.458
Mmm! Thank you, Tracker.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.129

Mmm! Thank you, Tracker.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.071
Hmph! Let me check myself

02:19.072 --> 02:19.671
Mmm! Thank you, Tracker.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.773
and see if you're
really out of coconuts.

02:20.774 --> 02:21.874
Mmm! Thank you, Tracker.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.576
Well, all the coconuts
are gone, huh?

Mmm! Thank you, Tracker.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.045
What's this?

02:26.046 --> 02:26.812

02:26.814 --> 02:27.446
That one looks so different.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.079
Mmm! Thank you, Tracker.

02:28.082 --> 02:28.781
I was worried
it would taste bad.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.481
Mmm! Thank you, Tracker.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.700
Muy malo. I've never seen a
golden coconut before. Nunca.

02:31.701 --> 02:33.918
Mmm! Thank you, Tracker.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.871
It's special like I'm special.
Open it up, pup.

02:35.872 --> 02:37.822

All this coconut gathering

02:49.469 --> 02:50.535
Mmm! Thank you, Tracker.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.771
and handing out
has made me tired.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.005
Mmm! Thank you, Tracker.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.557

(Making baby talk)

03:19.232 --> 03:19.864
Mmm!

he's kind of cute.

Huh?

03:36.584 --> 03:37.450
It hurts my ears.

Huh?

03:50.598 --> 03:54.700

Ryder, help!

03:55.202 --> 03:55.701
(Making baby talk)

03:55.703 --> 03:57.620
Mayor Humdinger drank coconut
water from the golden coconut

03:57.621 --> 03:59.538
(Making baby talk)

03:59.540 --> 04:00.356
and turned into un bebé.

04:00.357 --> 04:01.173
(Making baby talk)

04:01.175 --> 04:02.474
Huh?
(Gasping)

04:02.475 --> 04:03.774
(Making baby talk)

04:03.777 --> 04:05.527
Ay-yi-yi.
He's gonna start again!

04:05.528 --> 04:07.278
(Making baby talk)

04:07.281 --> 04:07.713
What do I do?

04:07.714 --> 04:08.146
(Making baby talk)

04:08.148 --> 04:09.181
We have to change him back
into a grown-up.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.215
(Making baby talk)

04:10.217 --> 04:11.984
Hmm. Do you have another
golden coconut?

04:11.985 --> 04:13.752
(Making baby talk)

04:13.754 --> 04:14.953
I think there was
only one golden coconut.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.153
(Making baby talk)

04:16.156 --> 04:17.506
Will water from another one
change him back?

04:17.507 --> 04:18.857
(Making baby talk)

04:18.859 --> 04:20.692
Maybe. But I guess we'll
have to get it from the jungle.

04:20.693 --> 04:22.526
(Making baby talk)

04:22.529 --> 04:23.462
Carlos can help!
For sure.

04:23.463 --> 04:24.396
(Making baby talk)

04:24.398 --> 04:25.881
Meanwhile, we gotta
watch this baby.

04:25.882 --> 04:27.365
(Making baby talk)

04:27.368 --> 04:29.335
No Mayor is too young,
no pup is too small!

04:29.336 --> 04:31.303
(Making baby talk)

04:31.305 --> 04:31.870
(Beeping)

04:31.871 --> 04:32.436
(Making baby talk)

04:32.439 --> 04:33.338
PAW Patrol, to the Lookout!

04:33.339 --> 04:34.238

04:44.652 --> 04:45.468
Whoa!

04:45.469 --> 04:46.285

(Crashing)

04:46.920 --> 04:47.552
(Making baby talk)

04:47.554 --> 04:48.053
Hey!

04:48.054 --> 04:48.553
(Making baby talk)

04:48.555 --> 04:49.805
Did we get new helmets?

04:49.806 --> 04:51.056
(Making baby talk)

04:51.058 --> 04:52.358
(All laughing)

04:52.359 --> 04:53.659
(Making baby talk)

05:02.269 --> 05:05.404
(Elevator bell dinging)

05:07.675 --> 05:11.009

05:13.113 --> 05:13.912
This is a strange one, pups.

05:13.913 --> 05:14.712
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.298
Mayor Humdinger drank
from a special coconut

05:16.299 --> 05:17.882
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.468
and has turned into a baby.

05:19.469 --> 05:21.052
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir.

05:21.055 --> 05:21.587
Goo goo.

05:21.588 --> 05:22.120
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.138
Aww, he looks so cute.

05:23.139 --> 05:24.155
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.125
He sure does. But we need to
turn him back into a grown-up.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.093
PAW Patrol, ready for action,
Ryder, sir.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.344
So, for this mission,
I'll need...

12:03.089 --> 12:04.889
(Huffing)

12:04.891 --> 12:06.241
They're not just
pretty polished,

12:06.242 --> 12:07.592
(Huffing)

12:07.594 --> 12:08.760
they're party polished.
(Laughing)

12:08.761 --> 12:09.927
(Huffing)

12:09.930 --> 12:12.130
You pups must be super excited
about going to Alex's party.

12:12.131 --> 12:14.331
(Huffing)

12:14.334 --> 12:14.833
CHASE:
We sure are!

12:14.834 --> 12:15.333
(Huffing)

12:15.335 --> 12:16.818
That's why our vehicles
need to look their best.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.302
(Huffing)

12:18.305 --> 12:20.255
And that's why
I'm turning my ride

12:20.256 --> 12:22.206
(Huffing)

12:22.209 --> 12:22.991
into a party-mobile.

12:22.992 --> 12:23.774
(Huffing)

12:23.777 --> 12:25.143
All right!

12:25.144 --> 12:26.510
(Huffing)

12:27.180 --> 12:31.616
A little to the left.
More to the right. Perfect.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.634
Now, big smile.

12:32.635 --> 12:33.651
A little to the left.
More to the right. Perfect.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.520
I can't wait till all
the kids and pups get here.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.388
A little to the left.
More to the right. Perfect.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.890
Especially when it's time
for the big surprise.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.391
A little to the left.
More to the right. Perfect.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.961
I love piñatas. You never know
what treasure is hidden inside.

12:42.962 --> 12:45.530
A little to the left.
More to the right. Perfect.

12:45.532 --> 12:45.881
Huh?!

12:45.882 --> 12:46.231
A little to the left.
More to the right. Perfect.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.532
(Laughing)
Well, I know what's inside.

12:47.533 --> 12:48.832
A little to the left.
More to the right. Perfect.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.085
We made it together
and filled it

12:50.086 --> 12:51.336
A little to the left.
More to the right. Perfect.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.105
with all kinds of treasures.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.873
A little to the left.
More to the right. Perfect.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.810
Treasure?
(Laughing)

12:58.812 --> 12:59.945
Come on. Let's get
more balloons.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.079
Treasure?
(Laughing)

13:01.081 --> 13:02.664
Hmm. What could be
in that piñata thing?

13:02.665 --> 13:04.248
Treasure?
(Laughing)

13:04.251 --> 13:05.817
Gold? Jewels? Candy?
Candy jewels?

13:05.818 --> 13:07.384
Treasure?
(Laughing)

13:07.387 --> 13:09.771
Whatever it is,
I must have it for myself.

13:09.772 --> 13:12.156
Treasure?
(Laughing)

13:12.159 --> 13:13.141
(Meowing)

13:13.142 --> 13:14.124
Treasure?
(Laughing)

13:14.127 --> 13:15.977
Oh, oh!
And for my kittens.

13:15.978 --> 13:17.828
Treasure?
(Laughing)

13:17.831 --> 13:18.430
(Meowing)

13:18.431 --> 13:19.030
Treasure?
(Laughing)

13:19.032 --> 13:20.565
You know what to do, kitty.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.099
Treasure?
(Laughing)

13:23.770 --> 13:25.670
(Chuckling)

13:25.672 --> 13:27.305
(Laughing)

13:27.306 --> 13:28.939
(Chuckling)

13:28.942 --> 13:31.293
See, Grandpa?
We do need more green balloons.

13:31.294 --> 13:33.645
(Chuckling)

13:33.647 --> 13:34.262
Huh?

13:34.263 --> 13:34.878
(Chuckling)

13:34.881 --> 13:35.897
Where's the piñata?

13:35.898 --> 13:36.914
(Chuckling)

13:36.917 --> 13:37.516
It was just here.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.116
(Chuckling)

13:38.118 --> 13:39.851
Aww! It was gonna be my favorite
part of the party.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.585
(Chuckling)

13:41.588 --> 13:43.038
Now, now, Alex, it'll be okay.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.489
(Chuckling)

13:44.491 --> 13:45.957
We've just got to...
yelp for help.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.424
(Chuckling)

13:47.427 --> 13:48.677
<i> (Ringing)</i>

13:48.678 --> 13:49.928
(Chuckling)

13:49.930 --> 13:50.662
Hi, Mr. Porter. What's up?

13:50.663 --> 13:51.395
(Chuckling)

13:51.398 --> 13:52.330
<i> The piñata for</i>

Oh, no.

13:55.768 --> 13:56.600

<i> at a worse time.</i>

13:57.937 --> 13:59.270
(Chuckling)

13:59.272 --> 14:00.822

<i> We're still decorating!</i>

14:00.823 --> 14:02.373
(Chuckling)

14:02.375 --> 14:03.775
Don't worry, Mr. Porter.
We'll save the party.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.176
(Chuckling)

14:05.178 --> 14:07.195
No piñata 's too big,
no pup is too small.

14:07.196 --> 14:09.213
(Chuckling)

14:09.216 --> 14:10.048

16:28.921 --> 16:29.687
Ryder, pups,

16:29.689 --> 16:31.806
You bet. To start, it would help
