WEBVTT

00:19.720 --> 00:21.360
There you go.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.960
Alright. Step right up.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.520
I've got a nice surprise
for all of you.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.400
Max.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.600
This guy.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.600
Do you remember him?
Did he take you?

01:52.600 --> 01:54.240
I don't know.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.840
- Just look closely.
- I am.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.440
I am looking closely.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.720
I don't know.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.000
Shit. Um...

02:15.560 --> 02:18.720
It's Mom's day visit today. Uh...

02:18.720 --> 02:21.640
I've got to go to the nursery, um...
I'll call Dora.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.040
-  I'll be fine.
-  No, I'll call her anyway.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.720
Oh, my God!

02:57.840 --> 02:59.440
Who found him?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.440
The shepherd,
early this morning.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.200
He thought it was a dead animal.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.280
Who did this?

03:11.240 --> 03:14.120
Uh, that chap says he saw
something entering the water.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.000
- What did he see?
- I'm not sure.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.040
He was drunk,
he wasn't making any sense.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.600
Come here. Come here.
Call Anton. Let him have a look.

03:30.120 --> 03:33.200
- Where are you going?
- To look around.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.200
You must be careful, hey.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.360
-  Hi, Mom.
- Hey.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.920
- I'll fetch her later.
- I can ask Dora to drop her off.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.680
Great. Thanks.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.160
I heard Yola is back.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.080
Ja.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.160
- She is.
- How is she doing?

04:01.320 --> 04:03.200
- Yeah, okay.
- Mm.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.560
Does she remember anything?

04:05.560 --> 04:07.800
Mm-mh. No, no. She doesn't.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.520
I'm sorry.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.680
I'm-- I'm gonna get her settled.
Okay?

04:11.680 --> 04:13.600
I'll see you later.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.400
Mom, I'm sorry, I've got
to go to the nursery, okay?

04:17.080 --> 04:19.080
Okay, I'm going to call Dora.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.680
-  Do you want a lift to town?
- Yes, please.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.840
Ah!

07:13.000 --> 07:16.120
- Spearmint.
- Ja. I'm taking it to the nursery.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.600
- It's a great antioxidant.
- Yeah.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.880
What's wrong? You okay?

07:29.280 --> 07:30.480
Mmh.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.680
- Have you taken a test?
- What test?

07:38.200 --> 07:39.880
Pregnancy test.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.280
What?

07:51.120 --> 07:54.120
- Ooh!

07:55.440 --> 07:56.960
Oh, my God.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.400
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- Okay.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.240
Here.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.040
I can't be pregnant.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.200
Oh.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.760
This looks cosy.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.280
Would you like some?

08:36.280 --> 08:37.880
Ah, no thanks.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.120
What do you think did this?
A crocodile?

09:14.280 --> 09:17.400
It could be. Or a huge likkewaan.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.240
Nile monitor.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.240
Those ones, they attack people?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.600
It's very unusual but
maybe in self-defence.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.160
Yeah... this does not look like
self-defence.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.040
Hey.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.480
- I saw what you did.
- Wait a minute, you were in my house?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.800
- Where are the others?
-  You broke into my house?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.600
What did you do with the others, Max?

10:28.600 --> 10:30.480
Ask my goats.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.120
Please don't! Please don't!

11:18.560 --> 11:20.520
Hey! Let him go.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.680
Let him go or you will breathe
through your fucking neck.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.000
Come.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.560
- I need the skull.
- No. No, no, no, no.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.600
Rudy!

11:32.120 --> 11:33.720
Rudy.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.000
You kept a trophy?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.880
- I--
- I told you to get rid of them...

11:37.880 --> 11:40.000
I told you to get rid
of all of them now.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.600
I can't see. I'm blind.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.200
No, you're not blind,
you are fucken stupid.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.680
It was just one skull, I swear.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.600
Dad was right, you really are
the runt of the litter.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.480
No. No, no, no.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.560
I'll fix it, Rudy.
I swear I'll fucking kill him.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.320
Yeah, yeah.
I've heard it all before.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.040
- Please don't leave me.
- Go rinse your eyes, asshole.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.000
Do you girls want a lift?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.040
-  Yes, please.
- Jump in.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.440
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

12:23.800 --> 12:25.720
You can ask me anything you want.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.960
The scar on your chest?

12:30.040 --> 12:31.680
What happened?

12:34.240 --> 12:35.880
A dream.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.160
A dream?

12:41.520 --> 12:44.280
I dreamt I saw my father
die on the kitchen floor.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.920
I was five.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.320
A week later my father
did die on that kitchen floor.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.480
My aunt poured boiling water...

13:05.880 --> 13:07.400
all over me.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.720
My grandmother sent me away
after that.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.600
Jesus.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.720
Sorry.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.520
I'll show you the runt of the litter.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.840
And they spoke to me.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.640
The spirit of the people in the bones.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.920
Um...

14:29.120 --> 14:30.920
Through the animals.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.040
No, man. Don't be silly.
Max. He admitted it.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.840
Human bones.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.920
Okay...

16:45.360 --> 16:46.960
Ay.

16:54.520 --> 16:58.200
Eish.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.840
It's got to be somewhere.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.040
Keep still motherfucker.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.320
Fuck!

19:01.480 --> 19:03.480
Yola,
where's Yvette?

19:05.440 --> 19:07.440
Yola, where's Yvette?

19:12.200 --> 19:13.720
Yvette?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.920
Case closed, you prick.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.080
Okay.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.000
I'm going.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.320
- Can you wait here for me?
- Sure.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.160
Thanks for the lift. Bye.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.920
Hello?

20:45.720 --> 20:47.320
Hello?

20:51.040 --> 20:52.800
Sienna?

20:53.240 --> 20:54.880
How's the thrush?

20:55.720 --> 20:59.000
Uh, much better.
Much better, thanks.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.840
Ah. How can I help you today?

21:03.640 --> 21:05.240
Um...

21:07.440 --> 21:08.680
Chewing gum.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.080
-  Allegra!
-  Allegra!

22:18.880 --> 22:20.760
What is going on? Get out of here.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.240
- But...
- Get out of here.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.600
- I will call aunty Dora.
- Witch!

22:25.720 --> 22:27.360
Leave her alone.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.560
Come.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.520
- What happened?

22:37.520 --> 22:38.800
It's okay.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.640
Yvette?

23:58.320 --> 23:59.960
What are you doing?

24:09.760 --> 24:14.520
You don't want to be remembering
what you did.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.320
Do you now?

24:32.480 --> 24:35.720
I don't think it's a good idea
considering her history.

26:58.840 --> 27:01.520
You know these day trips
are a privilege.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.200
One that can easily be revoked.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.920
You do know that, don't you?

27:22.680 --> 27:25.240
- Hey, Charlton.
-  Hey.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.040
Can I ask you some questions?

27:28.000 --> 27:31.360
- Sure.
- You're a friend of Themba's, right?

27:31.360 --> 27:33.080
Yeah, you could say that.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.120
Do you recognise this jacket?

27:40.640 --> 27:43.000
I... I think so.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.800
Is it Themba's?

27:45.720 --> 27:47.440
It looks like it.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.560
Well, is that a yes or a no?

27:50.560 --> 27:52.920
Yes. Why are you asking?

27:52.920 --> 27:55.960
We got a tip-off about
a hut up at black rock river.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.000
Do you know anything about it?

27:59.480 --> 28:01.680
It's a hut filled with dagga.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.120
A hut filled with dagga?

28:04.120 --> 28:06.600
Yeah. Way more for just
personal use.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.640
Um, why are you asking me
this?

28:08.640 --> 28:10.360
Just answer the question.

28:12.600 --> 28:16.000
No, no, (clearing throat) not until
you tell me what this is about.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.200
We think that's where Yola was held.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.840
- What? Like, as in kidnapped?
- Mm-hm.

28:22.720 --> 28:25.000
Wh-- What made you think
she was kept there?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.080
Found some of her clothing.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.520
And you think Themba
kidnapped her

28:31.520 --> 28:34.480
- and kept her at that hut?
- Well, that's what it looks like.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.520
No, he would...
he would never do that.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.880
But as far as you know,
this is his jacket?

28:41.520 --> 28:44.400
- Yes.
- But you don't know how it got there?

28:45.160 --> 28:46.760
No.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.920
Okay.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.200
I know it’s your hut.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.400
- No, it's... um... It's not...

29:00.400 --> 29:04.280
Come on, you were supplying
Jacob with weed for years.

29:05.240 --> 29:08.280
I also know that your sister
is in need of a new treatment.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.600
Um, I was gonna talk to you
about that. Um...

29:12.600 --> 29:15.120
Well, I've got a proposition for you.

29:15.120 --> 29:18.680
Let's call it a win-win proposition.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.760
Leave me alone.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.680
Don't wanna come down.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.760
- Themba, what the fuck are you doing?
- Listen to me.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.920
Just listen to me! Listen to me!

29:47.920 --> 29:50.240
- What?
- Someone is trying to kill me, man.

29:50.760 --> 29:54.040
Okay. I panicked and I ran.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.800
- They want you for kidnapping.
- Kidnapping? Kidnapping who?

29:56.800 --> 29:58.560
- Yola. They think you took Yola.
- What?

29:58.560 --> 30:01.480
- I know.
- That's crazy. Why would I do that?

30:01.480 --> 30:03.960
Because they...
but they found your jacket.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.000
Look man,
they're trying to set me up.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.680
- I told them that you didn't do it.
-  Themba!

30:08.040 --> 30:11.000
- Fuck!
- Just go. Go.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.640
Abel...

30:21.960 --> 30:23.600
Themba!

30:24.600 --> 30:29.000
Eyes spot on the wall
and everyone curtsy to your left.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.080
To your right.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.200
Right and smile at your new husband.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.600
- Excuse me.
- So sorry.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.880
I'm sorry, officer, we're in
the middle of a dance lesson.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.320
- Looking for someone.
-  You can't just--

30:39.320 --> 30:42.040
- Excuse me, you can’t just go...
- I'm doing my job, man.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.880
- Oh, sorry.
-  Get out!

30:45.880 --> 30:48.560
- We're getting changed. Get out!
-  I didn't know. Eish.

31:48.920 --> 31:50.720
Themba's cousin.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.720
What happened to her?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.680
She drowned?

31:59.360 --> 32:02.240
- When?
- Three years ago.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.760
Wow.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.680
That doesn't make sense.

32:23.960 --> 32:27.360
Hey. Can I get you guys anything?

32:27.360 --> 32:30.480
Uh... yeah, maybe
something sweet for you.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.640
Um... Vodka.

32:40.760 --> 32:42.360
Uh...

32:42.360 --> 32:47.320
The... the pharmacist.
It's, uh, it's complicated.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.520
-  Here you go.
- Thanks.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.680
Themba.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.920
- Th... uh!

35:39.560 --> 35:41.240
What?

35:52.440 --> 35:54.240
Welcome to your new home.

35:59.160 --> 36:00.880
Don’t waste your energy.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.960
I thought you were dead.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.800
So, why are you here?

36:15.480 --> 36:20.760
Because this doctor is supposed to be
a specialist at curing my condition.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.160
What condition?

36:27.840 --> 36:32.320
I'm not sure if being raped by
your uncle is an actual condition.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.400
You were right.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.200
It's okay.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.200
Yeah.

37:05.840 --> 37:08.560
Hey. I was looking for you.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.920
I just want to explain
what happened yesterday.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.240
- No.
-  Sienna...

37:14.480 --> 37:18.000
Sienna, please, give me a chance.
I can explain...

37:40.480 --> 37:41.960
Ola comos esta?
This is Yola.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.760
I can't speak right now but
phone me back later or don't.
