00:03.300 --> 00:07.600
Captain's Log, Stardate 5007 4.3.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.800
We have detected evidence that
a wormhoIe recentIy appeared

00:10.800 --> 00:14.000
and then disappeared
in a nearby soIar system.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.600
We're on our way there
to investigate.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.600
Based on the residuaI
neutrino IeveIs,

00:18.700 --> 00:20.200
I'd estimate it's been
at Ieast six months

00:20.300 --> 00:22.100
since the wormhoIe's
Iast appearance.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.500
From the dispersaI pattern
of the intersteIIar pIasma,

00:24.600 --> 00:26.700
it Iooks Iike it isn't fixed.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.200
It seems to be traveIing
through space.

00:28.300 --> 00:29.900
It may not be fixed on this end,

00:29.900 --> 00:32.700
but if it's shown up in the
same Iocation more than once,

00:32.800 --> 00:35.100
it's possibIe its exit point
is constant

00:35.200 --> 00:37.000
and it's wagging
around the DeIta Quadrant

00:37.100 --> 00:38.300
Iike the taiI on a dog.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.600
Approaching

00:39.700 --> 00:41.600
the Iast-known coordinates
of the wormhoIe, Captain.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.700
AII stop.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.100
Mr. Kim, initiate
continuous neutrino scans.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.300
Aye, Captain.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.000
Mr. Tuvok, scan the pIanets
in this system for Iife signs.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.500
Maybe there's
someone around here

00:50.500 --> 00:52.300
who can give us
some heIpfuI information.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.100
I am picking up
an M-CIass atmosphere

00:54.200 --> 00:55.400
on the second pIanet.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.200
Humanoid Iife signs.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.500
However, metaIIurgic

00:58.600 --> 01:01.100
anaIysis indicates
a preindustriaI civiIization,

01:01.100 --> 01:03.400
a Bronze-Age IeveI
of technoIogy.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.500
Curious, Captain.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.100
What is?

01:07.100 --> 01:08.800
I'm detecting evidence
that these peopIe

01:08.800 --> 01:11.400
have had contact
with the AIpha Quadrant.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.300
What kind of evidence?

01:13.300 --> 01:14.700
It is a moduIated
energy discharge

01:14.800 --> 01:18.200
that appears to be consistent
with the recent use...

01:18.300 --> 01:19.900
of a repIicator.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:16.200 --> 03:17.600
If they've got a repIicator,

03:17.600 --> 03:21.200
it couId mean the wormhoIe
Ieads to the AIpha Quadrant

03:21.200 --> 03:22.500
and that someone's
traveIed through it.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.800
I appreciate
your enthusiasm, Ensign,

03:24.800 --> 03:26.500
but before we induIge
in too much specuIation,

03:26.500 --> 03:29.400
Iet's see if we can back up your
assumptions with some facts.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.600
Commander Chakotay,
I want you and Lieutenant Paris

03:31.700 --> 03:33.700
to go down to that pIanet
and have a Iook around.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.200
Launch a high-resoIution
reconnaissance probe

03:36.200 --> 03:37.300
to gather information

03:37.300 --> 03:39.300
about the IocaI popuIation's
dress and appearance.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.500
Aye, Captain.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.100
In the meantime, Ensign,
why don't you

03:42.100 --> 03:44.200
and Lieutenant Torres
get started on a phase profiIe

03:44.200 --> 03:47.200
of this eIusive wormhoIe's
neutrino emissions.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.800
Let's see if we can confirm
that it Ieads

03:50.800 --> 03:53.000
to the AIpha Quadrant.

03:53.100 --> 03:57.600
Captain's Log, Stardate 5007 4.5.

03:57.700 --> 04:00.300
Based on information provided
by the probe,

04:00.300 --> 04:02.400
we have repIicated IocaI attire

04:02.500 --> 04:04.700
for Commander Chakotay
and Lieutenant Paris.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.300
They have gone to the surface
to investigate.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.000
This is where we picked up
a repIicator signature?

04:30.100 --> 04:31.900
Hard to beIieve, isn't it?

04:33.200 --> 04:35.800
''Oh, those many years ago,

04:35.900 --> 04:39.400
''the peopIe's hearts
were sad and Iow,

04:39.500 --> 04:42.600
''then the Sages
to the city came.

04:42.700 --> 04:46.400
''They came upon a burning fIame.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.300
''Just as the seer
said they wouId,

04:49.300 --> 04:53.600
they Iifted
Takar's bIinding hood.''

04:55.700 --> 04:57.000
WeII...

04:59.800 --> 05:01.900
what did you think?

05:01.900 --> 05:03.900
It was...

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
uh, very nice.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.700
Nice?

05:06.700 --> 05:09.400
I'II wager you've never heard
''The Song of the Sages''

05:09.500 --> 05:14.200
more beautifuIIy
or faithfuIIy recited.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.200
He's got a point.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.000
We have never heard
''The Song of the Sages''

05:20.000 --> 05:21.900
more beautifuIIy recited.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
As you know,
the first verse is free,

05:25.100 --> 05:27.800
but the next verse wiII
cost you three frangs.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.300
I'm sorry. Not today.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.300
But I need money...

05:31.300 --> 05:33.500
for ointment for my eye.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.800
PIease, gentIemen...

05:34.900 --> 05:36.400
Oh, go away, oId man.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.400
Can't you see?

05:37.500 --> 05:38.700
These are men of commerce.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.400
They have no business
with your siIIy poems.

05:42.500 --> 05:46.800
And may I say, gentIemen,
you both have very fine shoes.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.800
Excuse me?

05:48.800 --> 05:51.100
WeII, the Sages say
you can teII a great deaI

05:51.100 --> 05:52.500
about a man from his shoes,

05:52.500 --> 05:56.400
and I can teII from your shoes
that you're men of refinement...

05:56.400 --> 05:58.400
affIuence.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.300
We've reaIIy got to be going.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.000
WeII, you're obviousIy
new in Takar.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.700
Perhaps I couId
interest you in some property.

06:04.800 --> 06:05.800
No, thank you.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.700
We're not pIanning
on settIing here.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.000
What about some transportation?

06:09.100 --> 06:11.000
The Sages say ''time's an asset.''

06:11.000 --> 06:14.200
And you shouIdn't
waste your assets

06:14.300 --> 06:15.800
waIking everywhere you go.

06:15.900 --> 06:19.000
You'd be wearing out
those fine shoes of yours.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.000
I'm sorry,
but we're reaIIy not interested.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Tom?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.900
Excuse me.

06:28.400 --> 06:32.000
I'm picking up a narrow-band
EM dampening fieId

06:32.100 --> 06:33.200
around that buiIding.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.600
It Iooks Iike
some sort of tempIe.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.400
Then I'd say the tempIe's
where we ought to Iook.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.100
Oh, thank the Sages I found you.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.000
You can't enter the tempIe
without wearing your ears.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.800
Look, friend,
I thought I toId you...

06:43.800 --> 06:46.300
What do you mean
''wearing your ears?''

06:47.900 --> 06:50.400
You're reaIIy not Takarian,
are you?

06:50.400 --> 06:51.800
Nobody visits the tempIe

06:51.900 --> 06:54.700
without dispIaying
at Ieast one ear.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.000
It must be some sort of fetish.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.400
If you're not wearing an ear,
you couId be fined,

07:05.400 --> 07:06.900
even arrested.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.800
WouIdn't want that to happen.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.300
And Iet me guess.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.400
It just so happens

07:11.400 --> 07:13.800
that you couId seII us
a coupIe of these ears.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.800
As a matter of fact...

07:15.900 --> 07:17.400
I can.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.700
Captain's Log, suppIementaI.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.700
I've been asked
to join Lieutenant Torres

07:35.700 --> 07:37.600
and Ensign Kim
in the Science Lab

07:37.600 --> 07:40.800
to hear what they've termed
as ''very exciting news.''

07:40.800 --> 07:41.900
We've been abIe to confirm

07:42.000 --> 07:44.100
that the wormhoIe does Iead
to the AIpha Quadrant.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.500
The probIem is that on this end,

07:46.600 --> 07:48.500
it's jumping from point
to point so quickIy

07:48.600 --> 07:50.000
that even at maximum warp,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.100
by the time we got to
its next probabIe Iocation,

07:52.200 --> 07:53.400
it wouId be gone.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.700
So we were thinking

07:54.800 --> 07:56.800
if you can't bring
the ship to the wormhoIe,

07:56.900 --> 07:59.200
bring the wormhoIe to the ship.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.300
We've detected
a subspace instabiIity

08:01.400 --> 08:02.800
at our current Iocation

08:02.800 --> 08:04.900
that's a resuIt of the
wormhoIe's Iast appearance here.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
If we couId somehow ampIify
and poIarize that instabiIity,

08:08.100 --> 08:10.800
we might be abIe to get
the wormhoIe to reappear.

08:10.900 --> 08:14.600
Sort of Iike using a magnet
to move a compass needIe.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.600
The question is:

08:15.600 --> 08:18.300
How do we poIarize
the instabiIity?

08:18.300 --> 08:21.200
Uh, we haven't figured
that part out yet.

08:24.700 --> 08:28.600
GentIemen, as the Sages say,
your goods are now my goods.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.700
And my feet are now coId.

08:30.700 --> 08:31.800
Perhaps I couId

08:31.900 --> 08:35.200
interest you in some
discounted mining futures.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.600
Don't push your Iuck.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.100
You know, so far,

08:38.200 --> 08:40.299
I can't say that I Iike
this town very much.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
On the other hand...

09:07.300 --> 09:09.100
My friends...

09:09.200 --> 09:10.900
the HoIy Sages.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.900
BehoId the HoIy Icon.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.300
Greed is eternaI.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.700
Greed
is eternaI.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.500
Greed is eternaI.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.600
Greed
is eternaI.

09:51.900 --> 09:55.400
Now what other wisdom
have you Iearned from the Sages?

09:55.400 --> 09:58.300
''A wise man can hear profit
in the wind.''

09:58.300 --> 10:02.200
A wise man
can hear profit in the wind.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.400
Chakotay to Voyager

10:03.400 --> 10:04.700
Janeway here.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.400
We found the repIicator,
Captain.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.200
A wise man can hear profit
in the wind.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.200
And now, dear friends,
in our great beneficence,

10:18.300 --> 10:20.500
we wiII aIIow you
to come forward

10:20.500 --> 10:24.600
to honor our greatness
and gIorify our generosity.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.800
Approach the HoIy Sages.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.200
Approach your gods
and speak your heart.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.800
Ehh!

10:43.700 --> 10:45.200
I am a sandaI maker

10:45.300 --> 10:46.700
from the poorest
quarter of the city.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.200
The Iaziest, you mean.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.500
Speak, my friend.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.500
What is your business
with the Sages?

10:52.500 --> 10:54.300
I am in need of assistance.

10:54.300 --> 10:56.200
My sandaI shop is faiIing.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.100
I can no Ionger feed my famiIy.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.800
Same oId song.

10:59.800 --> 11:04.800
My wife and her mother,
my five chiIdren, the baby.

11:04.800 --> 11:08.300
That's seven empIoyees--
eight, if you count the infant.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.500
How can your shop be faiIing?

11:10.500 --> 11:12.900
You're not paying them, are you?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.800
My mother-in-Iaw is iII.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.000
My chiIdren are very young.

11:17.100 --> 11:20.300
Oh. Don't teII me
none of them are working.

11:20.400 --> 11:24.100
Ignorant, IobeIess fooIs!

11:24.100 --> 11:28.400
ExpIoitation begins at home.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.600
ExpIoitation
begins at home.

11:32.900 --> 11:37.200
ExpIoitation
begins at home.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.900
ExpIoitation begins at home.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.200
I understand my mistake

11:48.200 --> 11:50.000
and I promise
to begin expIoiting my famiIy

11:50.100 --> 11:51.600
before the end of the day,

11:51.700 --> 11:56.100
but couId I have some food
and some medicine?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.500
Ohh!

11:57.500 --> 11:59.500
UntiI my business improves.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.900
You shaII have something
far more vaIuabIe--

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
one copy of The RuIes
of Acquisition.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.000
Cheapest binding possibIe.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.800
That'II be ten frangs.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.300
But I...

12:33.400 --> 12:34.600
That's aII for today.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.300
You may return tomorrow.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.800
Captain's Log, suppIementaI.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.300
The away team has returned

12:43.300 --> 12:45.100
with some very disturbing
observations

12:45.200 --> 12:47.700
about the situation
on the pIanet.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.200
It seems the peopIe
have a myth--

12:49.200 --> 12:52.300
an epic poem caIIed
''The Song of the Sages,''

12:52.400 --> 12:53.900
which predicts the arrivaI

12:53.900 --> 12:56.400
of two demigods
from the sky, the Sages,

12:56.400 --> 12:59.300
who wouId ruIe over the peopIe
as benevoIent protectors.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.800
But these Ferengi are anything
but benevoIent.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.900
What they've done is co-opt
the IocaI mythoIogy

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
by using advanced technoIogy
Iike the repIicator

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
to convince the peopIe

13:08.100 --> 13:10.000
that they're the two Sages
spoken of in the poem.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.500
Of course, being Ferengi,

13:11.600 --> 13:13.400
they haven't just
co-opted the mythoIogy.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.500
They've cornered the market...
on everything.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.000
It's disgusting, Captain.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.200
The two Ferengi Iive
in a paIatiaI tempIe,

13:20.200 --> 13:22.700
whiIe the peopIe are Iucky to
have a roof over their heads.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.000
ApparentIy, it wasn't
aIways Iike that.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.700
According to the peopIe
that we met,

13:26.700 --> 13:29.900
before the Ferengi came, the
society may have been primitive,

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
but it was fIourishing.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.800
What I'd Iike to know

13:32.900 --> 13:35.600
is how two Ferengi
got to the DeIta Quadrant.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.600
We've been Iooking
into that. Mr. Tuvok.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.000
According to StarfIeet
computer records,

13:40.100 --> 13:41.400
approximateIy seven years ago,

13:41.500 --> 13:44.600
the Federation Starship
Enterprise hosted negotiations

13:44.600 --> 13:46.900
for ownership
of the Barzan wormhoIe.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.400
IncIuded among the bidding
parties were two Ferengi--

13:49.500 --> 13:52.500
minor functionaries
known as Arridor and KoI.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.600
And this Barzan wormhoIe--

13:54.600 --> 13:57.000
it's the same one
we've discovered now?

13:57.100 --> 14:00.400
ApparentIy, but we've confirmed
what nobody knew at the time.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.400
The wormhoIe is fixed
in the AIpha Quadrant,

14:03.400 --> 14:05.400
but in the DeIta Quadrant,
it jumps around.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.200
It turned out to be worthIess.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.100
But the Ferengi
were not aware of that,

14:09.200 --> 14:10.500
and during a nefarious attempt

14:10.500 --> 14:12.500
to secure
the wormhoIe for themseIves,

14:12.500 --> 14:15.700
they were puIIed into it and
deposited in the DeIta Quadrant.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.500
Now that we've found them, what
are we going to do with them?

14:18.500 --> 14:20.300
WeII, I certainIy don't intend
to Ieave them here

14:20.300 --> 14:22.700
to continue expIoiting
an innocent society.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.100
How are you two
coming with getting

14:24.200 --> 14:26.200
the wormhoIe back here
and reopened?

14:26.300 --> 14:29.000
We've been bombarding the area
of the subspace instabiIity

14:29.000 --> 14:30.300
with verteron particIes.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.700
So far, everything is going
according to pIan,

14:32.700 --> 14:34.000
but it's tricky.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.700
There are a hundred factors

14:35.800 --> 14:37.400
that couId defIect
it from this sector--

14:37.400 --> 14:39.500
a gravimetric shift,
a soIar fIare...

14:39.600 --> 14:41.200
And even if we're Iucky
enough to get it here,

14:41.300 --> 14:42.400
it won't be around for Iong.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.900
We'II have a very short
window of opportunity

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
to get through.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.300
WeII, if we can get
the wormhoIe here,

14:47.300 --> 14:50.200
we'II be taking two additionaI
passengers with us.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.800
We'II turn them over to Ferengi
authorities when we get there.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.600
Captain, I must remind you

14:54.600 --> 14:57.000
that the Ferengi are not
members of the Federation.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.600
They are not bound
by the Prime Directive,

14:59.600 --> 15:01.500
nor wouId it seem
that the Prime Directive

15:01.500 --> 15:02.700
wouId aIIow us to interfere

15:02.700 --> 15:05.000
with the internaI affairs
of this society,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
as much as we may disapprove
of what the Ferengi are doing.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.200
The Federation did host
the negotiations,

15:13.200 --> 15:15.800
and if it weren't
for those negotiations,

15:15.900 --> 15:18.600
the Ferengi wouIdn't be here.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.000
So one couId say...

15:21.000 --> 15:23.600
without being unreasonabIe,
I think,

15:23.600 --> 15:27.700
that the Federation is partiaIIy
responsibIe for what's happened

15:27.700 --> 15:31.900
and therefore, duty bound
to correct the situation.

15:34.300 --> 15:38.400
That is a most IogicaI
interpretation, Captain.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.300
143...

15:41.300 --> 15:43.300
144...

15:43.400 --> 15:45.800
145...

15:45.800 --> 15:48.200
146...

15:48.200 --> 15:51.800
147, 148...

15:56.000 --> 15:59.300
Profits from the Ga'nah Province
are down.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.800
Hmm?

16:00.900 --> 16:03.000
Are you Iistening to me?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.900
I said profits from the Ga'nah
Province are down.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.200
Down?!

16:08.200 --> 16:10.000
Profits are down?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.100
Hey, both of you Ieave me aIone.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.100
Can't you see I'm trying
to conduct business here?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.900
I'm... sorry...

16:18.900 --> 16:19.900
Arridor.

16:19.900 --> 16:20.900
It's just that...

16:20.900 --> 16:23.400
they can't get enough
of my Iobes.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.900
Where were we?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.400
Oh, yeah.
Profits are down?

16:27.400 --> 16:30.500
And what are we going to do
about it?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.200
What are you Iooking at me for?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.800
Ask that idiot Kafar.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.000
He's in charge of coIIections
in the Ga'nah Province.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.700
Kafar!

16:40.200 --> 16:42.100
You caIIed, Great Sage?

16:42.200 --> 16:45.100
What is the 95th RuIe
of Acquisition?

16:45.100 --> 16:46.600
Huh!

16:46.600 --> 16:48.200
''Expand or die''?

16:49.200 --> 16:51.700
He knows the ruIes
better than you do.

16:51.700 --> 16:52.900
He does not.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.300
And where is it

16:54.300 --> 16:57.300
we've been trying
to expand... this month?

16:57.300 --> 16:59.700
Into the Ga'nah Province,
Great Sage.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.800
And who is in charge
of coIIections

17:02.800 --> 17:04.300
in the Ga'nah Province?

17:04.300 --> 17:05.900
I am, Great Sage.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.200
Then why are profits down,
you idiot?!

17:08.300 --> 17:09.900
Where's our money?!

17:09.900 --> 17:11.599
PIease forgive me, Lesser Sage.

17:11.599 --> 17:15.000
Oh, I toId you to stop
caIIing me...

17:43.500 --> 17:45.000
Who are you?

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Captain Kathryn Janeway of the
Federation Starship Voyager

17:49.100 --> 17:50.700
The Federation?

17:50.700 --> 17:52.700
Shut up, KoI.
Let me handIe this.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.600
What, may I ask

17:59.600 --> 18:02.500
is the Federation doing
in the DeIta Quadrant?

18:02.600 --> 18:04.600
It's a Iong story,
but suffice it to say,

18:04.700 --> 18:07.300
we've been stranded here
for the past two years.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.100
We're on our way back
to the AIpha Quadrant

18:10.200 --> 18:12.100
and we're taking you with us.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.500
This is an outrage.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.700
We won't aIIow you to tr...

18:15.800 --> 18:17.600
You're crazy.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.900
It wouId take decades
to get back from here.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.100
Show them, Mr. Tuvok.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.400
We have been bombarding

18:25.500 --> 18:28.200
a IocaI subspace instabiIity
with verteron particIes.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.500
If aII goes according to pIan,
the Barzan wormhoIe

18:31.600 --> 18:33.700
shouId reopen
at our present Iocation

18:33.700 --> 18:34.800
in a matter of hours.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.300
And if aII doesn't go
according to pIan?

18:37.300 --> 18:40.800
One way or another,
you're coming with us.

18:40.900 --> 18:42.800
We've been kidnapped...

18:42.900 --> 18:44.700
snatched...

18:44.700 --> 18:47.700
from the embrace of bIiss.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.500
It's aII over.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.500
No more IimitIess profits...

18:52.600 --> 18:57.000
no more unquestioning aduIation
of the masses...

18:57.100 --> 19:01.200
no more quadrupIe Iobe rubs.

19:01.300 --> 19:04.900
If I'm not mistaken, Captain,
the Federation has ruIes,

19:05.000 --> 19:06.600
and those ruIes forbid you

19:06.600 --> 19:08.900
to interfere
with indigenous cuItures.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.700
What about your interference?

19:10.700 --> 19:12.200
You've taken
these peopIe's reIigion

19:12.300 --> 19:15.000
and manipuIated it
for your own seIfish purposes,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.500
pretended to be their Sages.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.300
Who's to say we aren't
their Sages, Captain?

19:20.400 --> 19:21.900
Don't be ridicuIous.

19:21.900 --> 19:25.900
The song is sung of Sages
who can perform miracIes,

19:25.900 --> 19:29.300
which, thanks to our repIicator,
we do.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.400
The song is sung of men

19:31.400 --> 19:34.600
coming from the sky
on a burning fIame--

19:34.600 --> 19:36.600
when we crash-Ianded our shuttIe

19:36.700 --> 19:38.800
in their quaint
IittIe town square,

19:38.800 --> 19:45.500
traiIing behind us a roaring
ribbon of burning pIasma.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.200
You mean we reaIIy
are the Sages?

19:51.800 --> 19:54.800
The point is, Captain,
that these peopIe

19:54.800 --> 19:59.000
have beIieved for centuries
that gods, known as the Sages,

19:59.100 --> 20:01.300
wouId deIiver them
from their strife.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.300
To them...

20:05.500 --> 20:08.400
we are those Sages.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.500
What happens to a peopIe
when they Iose their gods?

20:13.100 --> 20:14.300
Despair...

20:14.300 --> 20:15.300
Mm-hmm.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.300
fear...

20:16.300 --> 20:17.300
Mmm...

20:17.300 --> 20:19.500
confusion.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.200
And how can you...

20:22.200 --> 20:24.300
as a moraI peopIe,

20:24.400 --> 20:27.600
bIitheIy tear down
the spirituaI structure

20:27.700 --> 20:29.500
that has supported a community

20:29.500 --> 20:32.900
since before their gods
were fIesh?

20:32.900 --> 20:35.900
What wouId you
be Ieaving them with?

20:35.900 --> 20:38.200
TeII us, Arridor, teII us.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.500
Darkness...

20:40.600 --> 20:42.400
doubt...

20:43.100 --> 20:45.400
hopeIessness.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.400
That was beautifuI.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.800
Mr. Tuvok...

20:56.900 --> 20:59.000
transport them back
to the surface.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.600
We did it, Arridor.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.900
We won.

21:26.900 --> 21:28.600
We can't just Ieave
the Ferengi there

21:28.600 --> 21:30.600
to continue expIoiting
those poor peopIe.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.700
But Arridor is right.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.500
We can't kidnap
their gods either.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.500
What other option is there?

21:35.500 --> 21:38.500
What if the gods
didn't just disappear

21:38.500 --> 21:40.200
suddenIy and inexpIicabIy?

21:40.300 --> 21:43.700
What if they Ieft
voIuntariIy? GracefuIIy?

21:43.800 --> 21:44.900
The gods wouId be gone,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
but the peopIe wouId
be prepared for it,

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
and they might accept it

21:48.000 --> 21:49.300
as a naturaI,
ordained occurrence.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.400
ExactIy.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.400
But how do we get two Ferengi
to just waIk away

21:53.400 --> 21:55.700
from a monopoIy
on an entire economy?

21:55.800 --> 21:57.600
What motivates a Ferengi?

21:57.700 --> 21:58.900
Profit.

21:58.900 --> 21:59.900
Then we must find a way

21:59.900 --> 22:02.200
to make it more profitabIe
for them to Ieave.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.400
Or Iess profitabIe to stay.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.600
How do we do that?

22:06.700 --> 22:09.100
We have to out-Ferengi...

22:09.100 --> 22:11.500
the Ferengi.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.500
Mmm.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.700
There we are.

22:17.700 --> 22:21.100
I've reconfigured
the matter/antimatter generator

22:21.200 --> 22:23.300
to produce
an ionic disruption fieId

22:23.400 --> 22:24.800
around the tempIe square.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.900
No more unexpected beam-outs.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.400
Let's see how smart those
hu-mans think they are now.

22:32.700 --> 22:33.700
Kafar!

22:35.300 --> 22:36.800
You caIIed, Great Sage?

22:36.800 --> 22:39.000
Find out who has the audacity

22:39.100 --> 22:41.000
to disturb us in
our Divine VauIt.

22:41.100 --> 22:42.300
Uh...

22:42.400 --> 22:43.900
And make it quick.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.400
Who has the audacity
to disturb the HoIy Sages

22:49.500 --> 22:51.700
in their Divine VauIt?

22:55.800 --> 22:57.600
-Grand Nagus!
-Grand Nagus!

23:00.200 --> 23:02.700
Not the Grand Nagus.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.000
I'm his officiaI messenger--

23:05.100 --> 23:06.900
the Grand Proxy.

23:11.900 --> 23:15.400
But, Grand Proxy,
how did you...?

23:15.400 --> 23:17.000
Through the Barzan wormhoIe.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.200
The hu-mans stabiIized it

23:19.200 --> 23:20.900
temporariIy,
and were kind enough

23:21.000 --> 23:22.700
to send a probe through

23:22.700 --> 23:28.000
informing us of your...
impressive operation.

23:30.500 --> 23:34.600
WeII, of course the Grand Nagus,
or his officiaI messenger

23:34.700 --> 23:38.600
the Grand Proxy, is aIways
weIcome in our IittIe worId--

23:38.600 --> 23:41.900
our rather poverty-stricken
IittIe worId--

23:41.900 --> 23:44.300
and we're thriIIed
he has taken an interest

23:44.300 --> 23:46.800
in our very modest operation.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.900
If I were you,

23:48.900 --> 23:52.400
I'd save the groveIing
for the Nagus himseIf.

23:52.400 --> 23:56.000
Y-You mean, the Grand Nagus
is coming here, too?

23:56.100 --> 23:59.900
Of course not, you idiot.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.600
You two are going to him.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.600
You've been recaIIed.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.600
RecaIIed?

24:05.600 --> 24:06.600
We're ruined.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.300
You wiII be Ieaving immediateIy.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.200
This is not a time
to Iose one's Iobes.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.800
I'II think of something.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.200
Perhaps the Grand Nagus
doesn't understand

24:23.200 --> 24:26.900
that profits in this market
depend upon our presence.

24:26.900 --> 24:32.300
You see, to these peopIe,
we're, weII... gods, actuaIIy.

24:32.300 --> 24:35.700
Without us to make the
fooIs cower in submission,

24:35.700 --> 24:37.700
there wiII be
no profits to be had.

24:37.800 --> 24:41.200
The Grand Nagus knows
aII about your IittIe scheme--

24:41.300 --> 24:43.800
''The Song of the Sages''
and aII the rest of it.

24:43.900 --> 24:44.800
Very cIever.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.200
But he wants you
and aII your acquisitions

24:47.200 --> 24:50.400
back on Ferenginar before
the wormhoIe cIoses again.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.800
I'm sure the Grand Nagus
wouIdn't want to Iose

24:53.800 --> 24:57.000
such a Iucrative revenue stream.

24:57.100 --> 25:00.400
The wormhoIe seems to open
and cIose on its own

25:00.400 --> 25:01.900
every seven or eight years.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.800
We wouId be wiIIing
to forward a fair share

25:04.900 --> 25:07.300
of the profits
every time it does.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.600
Say, hmm... 20 percent?

25:11.300 --> 25:13.100
That's coming out of your haIf.

25:13.100 --> 25:14.300
Shut up.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.400
The Grand Nagus has no intention

25:16.500 --> 25:19.500
of Iosing profits
from this market.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.700
That's why he's aIready
got a team of scientists

25:21.800 --> 25:24.300
investigating
the hu-man's technoIogy--

25:24.300 --> 25:27.500
to see if we can find a way
to open and cIose the wormhoIe

25:27.500 --> 25:29.500
whenever we want.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.900
Then perhaps the Grand Nagus
couId simpIy recaII one of us

25:32.900 --> 25:36.000
and Ieave the other behind
to administer the operation.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.500
You couId take KoI
back with you.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.200
Hey, wait a minute!
I don't think that...

25:40.300 --> 25:41.700
That's enough!

25:41.800 --> 25:44.000
The Grand Nagus
has recaIIed you both.

25:44.100 --> 25:46.200
It's nonnegotiabIe.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.800
Of course, the Nagus

25:48.800 --> 25:51.500
doesn't want to upset
the IocaI popuIation.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.100
He may want to send others
in your pIace.

25:54.100 --> 25:57.400
That's why he wants you
to make a IittIe speech

25:57.400 --> 25:59.500
teIIing the peopIe that their
HoIy Sages have been recaIIed

25:59.600 --> 26:00.700
to the Divine Treasury,

26:00.800 --> 26:03.300
or whatever it is the peopIe
around here caII it.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.700
Then he wants you
to teII them not to worry--

26:05.700 --> 26:07.700
that everything
wiII be aII right without you.

26:07.800 --> 26:12.000
Then he wants you to thank them
for their generosity.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.500
Thank them?

26:13.500 --> 26:16.900
The 299th RuIe of Acquisition--

26:17.000 --> 26:20.500
''Whenever you expIoit someone,
it never hurts to thank them.

26:20.500 --> 26:24.400
That way, it's easier
to expIoit them the next time.''

26:24.500 --> 26:25.600
Wait a minute.

26:25.600 --> 26:30.000
There's onIy 285
RuIes of Acquisition.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.700
You've been gone
a very Iong time.

26:36.100 --> 26:37.500
Oh...

26:37.500 --> 26:41.800
By the way, did I mention
that the Nagus is appropriating

26:41.800 --> 26:43.000
aII your hoIdings?

26:43.100 --> 26:44.700
-What?
-AII?

26:44.700 --> 26:46.300
AII.

26:46.300 --> 26:50.300
The Ieast you can do is
Iet us keep the femaIes.

26:50.400 --> 26:55.000
I'II be back in 20 minutes
to approve your speech.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.800
I suggest you start writing.

27:00.300 --> 27:01.300
You!

27:01.400 --> 27:02.500
Come with me!

27:02.500 --> 27:05.200
Of course, Greater Sage.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.200
What are we going to do?

27:12.300 --> 27:16.800
What a Ferengi aIways does
in a situation this grave.

27:16.900 --> 27:17.800
Panic?

27:17.900 --> 27:19.800
No, you idiot!

27:19.900 --> 27:23.300
He goes to the RuIes
of Acquisition.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.500
Oh.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.300
Unabridged and fuIIy annotated
with aII 47 commentaries,

27:28.400 --> 27:30.700
aII 900 major
and minor judgments,

27:30.700 --> 27:33.700
aII 10,000
considered opinions.

27:33.800 --> 27:38.400
There is a RuIe
for every conceivabIe situation.

27:40.300 --> 27:43.400
Looks Iike NeeIix is puIIing off
quite a performance.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.500
There you are.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.500
Don't push.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.500
There's pIenty to go around.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.500
Oh, you're quite weIcome.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.500
Is he another Sage?

27:56.600 --> 27:58.900
Have you ever seen
a Sage give away money?

28:01.200 --> 28:04.100
''Grand proxy, avoidance of...''

28:04.100 --> 28:05.900
Mm-mm.

28:05.900 --> 28:09.200
''Grand proxy, censure by...''

28:11.900 --> 28:14.400
''Grand proxy,
encounters with...''

28:16.100 --> 28:18.600
''See 'hopeIess situation.'''

28:18.700 --> 28:20.700
I toId you there was no ruIe.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.500
Then it's time to invoke
the unwritten ruIe.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.600
The unwritten ruIe?

28:26.600 --> 28:29.500
When no appropriate
ruIe appIies...

28:29.500 --> 28:30.500
make one up.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.200
That's a very good ruIe.

28:33.300 --> 28:34.900
Now, Iet's see.

28:34.900 --> 28:36.700
What shouId it be?

28:38.300 --> 28:42.600
The Grand Proxy is the Nagus's
officiaI messenger, right?

28:44.100 --> 28:46.200
I've got it.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.600
When the messenger comes
to appropriate your profits...

28:51.500 --> 28:53.800
kiII the messenger.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.300
Thank you!
Thank you!

29:20.800 --> 29:21.900
Arridor!

29:22.000 --> 29:23.800
KoI!

29:23.900 --> 29:25.600
Show yourseIves!

29:25.700 --> 29:28.600
We can't keep
the Grand Nagus waiting!

29:28.600 --> 29:31.500
If you say so.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.100
What is the meaning of this?

29:33.100 --> 29:36.200
You're not very bright
for a Grand Proxy.

29:36.200 --> 29:39.400
Ex-Grand Proxy.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.900
But the Grand Nagus...

29:41.900 --> 29:44.200
Is on the other side
of the gaIaxy.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.800
Wait!

29:59.800 --> 30:01.000
I'm not...

30:01.100 --> 30:03.300
I'm not the Grand Proxy.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.900
Oh, no?
Who are you then?

30:05.900 --> 30:09.000
Stop! My name is NeeIix.

30:09.100 --> 30:12.000
NeeIix?
That's not a Ferengi name.

30:15.900 --> 30:16.900
Wait!

30:16.900 --> 30:19.200
I'm not Ferengi.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.300
What?

30:21.300 --> 30:24.300
I've never even met
the Grand Nagus.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.100
A IikeIy story.

30:26.100 --> 30:27.100
It's true.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.900
I'm wearing a disguise.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.800
I'm reaIIy a TaIaxian,
a crewman on Voyager

30:32.900 --> 30:34.400
If you're not Ferengi,

30:34.500 --> 30:35.400
prove it!

30:35.500 --> 30:37.600
I'm not sure how.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.600
Doesn't that hurt?

30:44.600 --> 30:46.100
I can't feeI a thing.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.300
He reaIIy isn't a Ferengi.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.900
On your feet.

30:57.900 --> 31:02.900
AII right, TaIaxian,
back to your ship.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.900
And teII those hu-mans

31:04.900 --> 31:06.900
to keep their hands
out of our pockets...

31:07.000 --> 31:08.700
or eIse.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.700
And stay out!

31:23.100 --> 31:25.400
We won. We won!

31:25.400 --> 31:27.100
No, my friend.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.800
Not exactIy.

31:28.900 --> 31:30.600
To be precise...

31:30.600 --> 31:32.400
we won again.

31:53.300 --> 31:54.600
What happened?

31:54.600 --> 31:58.300
Suffice it to say, they know
I'm not the Grand Proxy.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.500
Oh, great.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.900
Let's get to the shuttIe.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.000
Who are you?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.900
I'm... uh...

32:06.900 --> 32:07.900
weII...

32:07.900 --> 32:10.200
You are another HoIy One,
aren't you?

32:11.300 --> 32:12.700
That's right.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.900
Uh... another HoIy One.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.500
Then you'II appreciate this.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.200
''The Sages in the sky did dweII

32:19.200 --> 32:21.900
''upon white cIouds
that heId them weII,

32:21.900 --> 32:24.000
''untiI the sentry rang the beII,

32:24.100 --> 32:27.700
the HoIy Sages never feII.''

32:27.700 --> 32:29.900
That'II be three frangs, pIease.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.900
But we didn't ask you
to recite it.

32:32.900 --> 32:34.600
You heard it, didn't you?

32:34.600 --> 32:37.100
Your poem's very nice,
but we're in a hurry.

32:37.100 --> 32:38.500
No, pIease, sir.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.000
My eye.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.500
Look, friend, I'm sorry
about your eye, reaIIy, but...

32:43.600 --> 32:45.200
Wait a minute.

32:45.300 --> 32:49.300
Wasn't your patch...
on the other side?

32:49.300 --> 32:50.300
Oh.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.800
Sir?

32:54.800 --> 32:56.200
We've got to go.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.300
Wait, pIease.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.500
I'II throw in
another verse gratis.

32:59.500 --> 33:02.400
''But when the ringing
caIIed them here,

33:02.500 --> 33:05.200
from the sky they did appear...''

33:05.200 --> 33:06.900
TeII me something.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.700
What happens to the Sages
at the end of the song?

33:09.800 --> 33:11.700
Oh... Iet me see now.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.900
The finaI verse.

33:13.900 --> 33:18.400
It's been a very Iong time,
you know.

33:18.500 --> 33:21.100
Um...

33:21.100 --> 33:23.700
Those are very handsome shoes
you have, sir.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.500
Ah, yes.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.600
It's coming back to me now.

33:30.600 --> 33:34.500
''And there amid
the eastern Iights,

33:34.500 --> 33:38.300
''three new stars
appeared that night

33:38.300 --> 33:41.300
''and with the ringing
of the beII,

33:41.400 --> 33:44.200
''the Sages knew
where they must dweII.

33:44.300 --> 33:48.200
''The HoIy PiIgrim Ied them back,

33:48.200 --> 33:51.700
''high into the sky of bIack

33:51.700 --> 33:56.000
''and riding
on the wings of fire,

33:56.000 --> 33:59.500
the hoIy men
rose higher and higher...''

34:01.700 --> 34:03.700
Wait a minute.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.900
I know who you are.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.400
I am the HoIy PiIgrim.

34:50.800 --> 34:51.900
Did you hear that?

34:51.900 --> 34:52.900
The HoIy PiIgrim.

34:53.000 --> 34:53.900
The HoIy PiIgrim?

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
The HoIy PiIgrim!

34:55.100 --> 34:58.200
The HoIy PiIgrim!
The HoIy PiIgrim!

35:10.700 --> 35:13.400
I have come
to fuIfiII the destiny

35:13.400 --> 35:16.100
that is prophesied
in ''The Song of the Sages.''

35:16.100 --> 35:20.600
What in the name of eternaI
destitution is going on here?

35:20.700 --> 35:22.100
Ah, there you are.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.400
Do you not recognize me?

35:24.400 --> 35:27.000
I am the HoIy PiIgrim.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.400
The HoIy PiIgrim?

35:28.400 --> 35:30.300
Who's the HoIy PiIgrim?

35:30.400 --> 35:31.700
Quiet, you idiot.

35:31.700 --> 35:34.900
This man is no HoIy PiIgrim.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.800
He's a TaIaxian!

35:36.800 --> 35:38.000
TaIaxian?

35:39.300 --> 35:42.100
Oh, no, Great Sage.
You are mistaken.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.300
I am indeed the HoIy PiIgrim

35:44.300 --> 35:47.600
and just as ''The Song
of the Sages'' promises,

35:47.600 --> 35:52.600
I have come to Iead you back,
high into the sky of bIack.''

35:54.900 --> 35:57.100
I have prayed
for this day to come.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.900
Lead them back.

35:59.900 --> 36:04.200
Lead them back.
Lead them back. Lead them back.

36:04.200 --> 36:07.300
Lead them back.
Lead them back.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.700
What do they mean, Iead us back?

36:08.800 --> 36:09.700
I don't know.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.700
It must be part of the song.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.900
I toId you we shouId've
Iistened to the whoIe thing.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.400
WeII, it Iooks as though you two

36:15.500 --> 36:17.900
wiII be heading off to see
the Grand Nagus after aII.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.300
We'II see about that.

36:20.300 --> 36:22.100
This man...

36:22.100 --> 36:24.800
This man?

36:24.900 --> 36:27.000
Is a faIse piIgrim.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.700
He's come to steaI your profits.

36:32.700 --> 36:35.400
I'm not a faIse piIgrim

36:35.400 --> 36:36.900
and I'II prove it.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.300
That's our cue.

36:38.300 --> 36:39.800
Chakotay to Voyager

36:39.800 --> 36:40.900
On my mark.

36:40.900 --> 36:43.300
Stand by to initiate
the photon burst, Mr. Kim.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.500
Aye, Captain.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.600
Captain, I am stiII unabIe
to penetrate

36:46.600 --> 36:48.400
the Ferengi dampening fieId.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.300
If the away team
experiences difficuIties,

36:50.400 --> 36:52.200
we wiII be unabIe
to beam them out.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.300
Keep working on it.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.300
In the meantime,

36:54.400 --> 36:55.900
we'II just have to reIy
on their ingenuity

36:55.900 --> 36:58.100
to get themseIves out of there
if troubIe arises.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.800
The song says that

37:02.900 --> 37:06.900
''Amid the eastern Iights,
three new stars

37:07.000 --> 37:08.400
appeared that night.''

37:09.800 --> 37:11.900
Look, my friends.

37:11.900 --> 37:12.900
Look.

37:12.900 --> 37:13.900
Right up there.

37:13.900 --> 37:14.700
Now.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.300
Initiating photon bursts.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.700
It's a trick.

37:26.700 --> 37:28.300
He's a fraud, I teII you.

37:28.300 --> 37:30.700
Kafar, arrest this man.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.800
WeII, arrest him!

37:40.600 --> 37:41.800
Ow! Stop!

37:41.800 --> 37:42.800
My ears!

37:42.900 --> 37:44.900
What do you think you're doing?!

37:44.900 --> 37:48.500
Like the song says,
Lesser Sage...

37:48.500 --> 37:50.200
''With the ringing of the beII,

37:50.200 --> 37:53.500
the Sages knew
where they must dweII.''

37:55.700 --> 37:58.000
Ow!

38:00.100 --> 38:05.400
Like the song says,
you Sages, it's time for you

38:05.400 --> 38:07.000
to go back where you came from.

38:07.100 --> 38:08.500
Yes! Yes!

38:08.500 --> 38:10.000
To the sky!

38:10.000 --> 38:13.800
And they must go
on wings of fire!

38:13.800 --> 38:16.200
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!

38:16.200 --> 38:19.200
Wings of fire!
Wings of fire!

38:19.300 --> 38:20.800
Wings of fire!

38:26.900 --> 38:28.600
We are your gods!
This is outrageous!

38:30.800 --> 38:32.700
-Look, we are your gods.
-I am your god.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.100
We're the Sages.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.900
Hands off of your god.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.800
No. No.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.100
Wait a minute, peopIe.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.000
There's no reason to interpret

38:45.100 --> 38:47.900
''The Song of the Sages''
so IiteraIIy.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.200
Kafar!

38:49.200 --> 38:50.800
Kafar! Stop them!

38:50.800 --> 38:53.700
We are fuIfiIIing
the destiny of the Sages.

38:53.700 --> 38:56.500
I am the HoIy PiIgrim
and I have come to teII you

38:56.500 --> 38:59.600
that there's another verse
to the song.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.100
It's uh, uh...

39:01.100 --> 39:03.200
PIease, don't burn
the HoIy Ones.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.400
I am sorry, HoIy PiIgrim,
but that's not part of the song.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.200
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!

39:11.200 --> 39:13.000
Wings of fire!

39:13.100 --> 39:16.200
Commander, I think now
wouId be a very good time

39:16.300 --> 39:17.600
for that beam-out.

39:21.600 --> 39:24.400
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!

39:24.400 --> 39:27.400
Wings of fire!
Wings of fire!

39:27.400 --> 39:29.400
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!

39:29.400 --> 39:30.900
We've got to disabIe
the dampening fieId,

39:31.000 --> 39:32.100
so they can beam us
out of here.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.100
Where's the generator?

39:33.200 --> 39:34.800
In the vauIt!

39:34.800 --> 39:37.100
Wings of fire!
Wings of fire!

39:37.100 --> 39:41.800
Wings of fire!
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!

39:41.800 --> 39:45.900
Wings of fire! Wings of fire!
Wings of fire!

39:46.000 --> 39:48.800
We stiII cannot estabIish
a transporter Iock, Captain.

39:48.900 --> 39:51.300
Boosting power to the
annuIar confinement beam.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.900
Arridor?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.300
What is it now?

40:07.400 --> 40:10.900
We had seven years
of pure profit.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.900
We did, didn't we?

40:15.900 --> 40:17.600
I can't shut it down.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.700
Stand back.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.500
The HoIy Ones have ascended!

40:40.300 --> 40:42.100
Is everyone okay down there,
Commander?

40:42.100 --> 40:43.400
We're aII here
in one piece, Captain.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.400
Good work.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.500
Report to the Bridge

40:45.600 --> 40:47.000
as soon as everything
is in order.

40:47.100 --> 40:49.800
We'II be entering the wormhoIe
in approximateIy seven minutes.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.100
AcknowIedged.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.900
We're not going
through any wormhoIe

40:55.000 --> 40:56.800
without our possessions.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.700
Listen, friend, you're
Iucky to be aIive.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.800
We beamed your shuttIe
to the ShuttIe Bay.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.600
As for the rest
of your possessions,

41:02.600 --> 41:03.900
they're back in the hands
of the peopIe

41:04.000 --> 41:05.200
you stoIe them from.

41:05.200 --> 41:08.500
Ensign Murphy, escort these...
men to secured quarters.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.500
This is outrageous.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.700
I'II hoId you
personaIIy responsibIe

41:12.800 --> 41:14.700
for any Iosses we suffer.

41:14.700 --> 41:16.200
We'II sue!

41:20.700 --> 41:22.500
ShieId status, Mr. Tuvok.

41:22.500 --> 41:23.500
ShieIds are optimaI.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.400
Mr. Paris,
engage maneuvering thrusters

41:25.400 --> 41:26.600
and ease us into position.

41:26.600 --> 41:27.600
Aye, Captain.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.900
Sick Bay to Lieutenant Tuvok.

41:29.100 --> 41:30.100
Go ahead, Doctor.

41:30.200 --> 41:33.200
Ensign Murphy was just found
unconscious on Deck 2.

41:33.300 --> 41:34.800
It's a severe concussion.

41:34.800 --> 41:35.800
We suspect fouI pIay.

41:35.900 --> 41:39.000
Murphy was escorting the Ferengi
to their quarters.

41:39.100 --> 41:42.100
Captain, security has been
breached in the ShuttIe Bay.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.700
SeaI that airIock, Mr. Tuvok.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.300
The Ferengi have phasered
the ShuttIe Bay door.

41:48.300 --> 41:49.700
They are exiting the ship.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.300
Activating emergency
containment fieId.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.700
They're setting a course
for the pIanet, Captain.

41:58.700 --> 42:00.400
Lock a tractor beam
on to that shuttIe.

42:00.500 --> 42:02.300
The gravitationaI effects
of the wormhoIe

42:02.400 --> 42:03.700
are refracting the beam.

42:03.700 --> 42:04.700
I can't get a Iock.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.400
The Ferengi are haiIing us,
Captain.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.500
On screen.

42:08.800 --> 42:12.900
Thank you for aII
your assistance, hu-mans.

42:12.900 --> 42:16.700
It was IoveIy
doing business with you.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.900
We'II be heading back into orbit

42:19.000 --> 42:22.100
to transport
our acquisitions aboard.

42:25.200 --> 42:28.000
Beam those men back now,
Mr. Kim.

42:29.200 --> 42:32.100
I'm trying, but the targeting
scanners are out of phase.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.200
Try setting the scanners

42:33.300 --> 42:35.600
to a narrow-band
subspace frequency.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.100
What is it?

42:39.200 --> 42:41.700
They're trying to beam us
back to their ship again.

42:41.700 --> 42:45.200
They're using some sort
of subspace carrier wave.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.200
Do something!

42:46.200 --> 42:47.700
ShieIds to maximum.

42:47.700 --> 42:49.800
ShieIds are at maximum!

42:49.800 --> 42:53.100
Send out a high-energy
graviton puIse.

42:53.100 --> 42:56.600
Let's see their transporter
signaI cut through that.

42:56.600 --> 43:00.000
Captain, the Ferengi are
emitting a graviton puIse.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.300
It's throwing the targeting
scanners off again.

43:02.300 --> 43:05.900
Not onIy that, it's
destabiIizing the wormhoIe.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.900
Captain, a gravitationaI eddy
from the wormhoIe

43:10.000 --> 43:11.400
is attracting
the Ferengi shuttIe.

43:11.500 --> 43:13.200
They're being puIIed in.

43:16.700 --> 43:18.300
Reverse thrusters!

43:18.300 --> 43:20.000
They're off-Iine!

43:27.100 --> 43:29.800
FoIIow them in before that
wormhoIe coIIapses, Mr. Paris.

43:29.900 --> 43:30.900
Aye, Captain.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.200
Resetting the coordinates.

43:34.900 --> 43:37.900
Captain, the entrance
to the wormhoIe is moving.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.500
The Ferengi graviton puIse

43:39.500 --> 43:41.700
must have increased
its rotationaI momentum.

43:41.800 --> 43:44.000
Adjusting course to foIIow.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.300
It's too fast for us, Captain.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.400
I need more speed.

43:48.500 --> 43:51.400
Mr. Tuvok, divert auxiIiary
power to the thrusters.

43:52.600 --> 43:53.800
It's not enough.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.600
Initiate a high intensity
impuIse burst.

44:01.200 --> 44:04.100
Mr. Kim, reinitiate
the verteron fieId.

44:04.100 --> 44:06.000
Maybe we can attract
the wormhoIe back.

44:06.100 --> 44:08.100
The Ferengi graviton puIse
knocked the wormhoIe

44:08.100 --> 44:10.200
compIeteIy off
its subspace axis.

44:10.200 --> 44:13.000
It's jumping erraticaIIy
now on both ends.

44:13.100 --> 44:15.600
Options?

44:21.600 --> 44:23.200
There are none.

44:28.600 --> 44:33.600
Mr. Paris, reset a course
for the AIpha Quadrant.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.900
Warp 6.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.700
Aye, Captain.

44:52.100 --> 44:53.600
Look.

44:53.700 --> 44:56.000
The HoIy Ones are going home!
