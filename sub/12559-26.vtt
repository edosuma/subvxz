A CONDEMNED MAN NAMED JAGGER,

03:27.541 --> 03:29.532
AND A SMALL,
INCONSEQUENTIAL VILLAGE

WILL SHORTLY FIND OUT THAT
THERE ARE CAUSES AND EFFECTS

03:33.213 --> 03:34.874

03:34.965 --> 03:37.252
SUCH IS USUALLY THE CASE
IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.481
HOW ABOUT THAT?

04:02.576 --> 04:03.987
YOU SEE IT OUTSIDE?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.909
YOU BETTER
RUN AN EXTRA

04:05.996 --> 04:07.907

WHAT'S YOUR THESIS?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.861
IT'S A QUARTER TO EIGHT.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.651
IT'S A QUARTER TO EIGHT
IN THE MORNING

04:39.738 --> 04:41.445
AND IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.784
DAYLIGHT SHOULD HAVE
COME TWO HOURS AGO.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.858
WELL, IN BETWEEN
REASSURING PEOPLE

04:45.952 --> 04:48.535
THAT THIS VVAS NOT AN
INTERPLANETARY INVASION,

04:48.622 --> 04:50.112
NOR THE END
OF THE WORLD,

04:50.207 --> 04:52.790
I PLACED A CALL TO
THE STATE CAPITAL.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.458
IS IT BLACK THERE?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.706
IT APPEARS THAT
ACROSS THE FACE

04:56.797 --> 04:58.379
OF THE ENTIRE EARTH

04:58.465 --> 05:00.672
WE ARE THE ONLY ONES
GROPING IN DARKNESS.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.966
SO IT SEEMS
THE PHENOMENON

05:03.053 --> 05:04.543
IS QUITE LOCALIZED

05:04.638 --> 05:07.801
AND WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO SEEK ELSEWHERE

05:07.891 --> 05:10.633
FOR COMPANY TO
SHARE OUR MISERY.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.813
HAVE YOU SEEN
JAGGER THIS MORNING?

05:12.896 --> 05:14.478
I SEEN HIM.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.896
I BROUGHT HIM IN
A CUP OF COFFEE.

05:16.983 --> 05:21.398
I ALSO REMINDED HIM ABOUT
VVHAT DAY IT VVAS.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.321
I'LL BET YOU DID.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.320
HOVV DID YOU OCCUPY
YOURSELF AS A LAD, DEPUTY?

05:27.410 --> 05:28.787
TORTURING SMALL ANIMALS

05:28.870 --> 05:30.986
OR JUST PULLING
WINGS OFF FLIES?

05:31.081 --> 05:33.573
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT, MR. COLBEY?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.328
NOTHING.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.580
NOTHING AT ALL.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.708
CAN I TALK TO JAGGER?

05:39.798 --> 05:41.664
GO RIGHT ON IN.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.707
AS A POINT OF
INTEREST, SHERIFF,

05:43.802 --> 05:45.918
IS JAGGER INNOCENT?

05:46.012 --> 05:48.925
THAT IS A MATTER FOR
A JURY, PUBLIC OPINION AND GOD,

05:49.015 --> 05:51.677
AND THAT, THANK THE LORD,
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

05:51.768 --> 05:55.352
SO LET US ALL PRAISE GOD FOR
THE MORNING'S IMPARTIALITY.

05:55.438 --> 05:59.432
AND FOR JUSTICE BEING

05:59.526 --> 06:00.857
<i>DEPUTY...</i>

06:00.944 --> 06:03.686
WHY DON'T YOU
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.282
I GOT A RIGHT
TO AN OPINION.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.356
INDEED YOU
HAVE, DEPUTY.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.986
INDEED YOU HAVE.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.445
BUT THERE'S JUST A FEW
DISTURBING FACETS

06:12.539 --> 06:13.870
ABOUT THIS CASE.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.447
ONE...

06:15.542 --> 06:17.624
THE MURDERED MAN
WAS NOT A DECENT MAN.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.794
HE WAS A CROSS-BURNING,
PSYCHOPATHIC BULLY

06:20.881 --> 06:22.963
WHO ATTACKED
THE MAN IN THERE.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.132
AND TVVO, DEPUTY PIERCE
HERE SAVV IT HAPPEN

06:26.219 --> 06:28.130
AND THEN PERJURED HIMSELF.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.462
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE!

06:30.557 --> 06:32.798
PERJURED IS
THE WORD, DEPUTY.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.305
NOW, YOU SAID
JAGGER SHOT HIM

06:35.395 --> 06:37.227
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.645
NO SUCH THING.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.567
THE MURDERED MAN HAD
POWDER BURNS ALL OVER HIM.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.648
THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE
PROVEN SELF-DEFENSE

06:49.743 --> 06:52.735
BUT IT WOULD'VE POINTED
TO IT AND MAYBE HELPED IT.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.992
AND YOU, SHERIFF KOCH,
YOU SAW THE BODY.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.823
BUT I DIDN'T HEAR
ANY COMMENTS

06:57.918 --> 06:59.204
ON THOSE
POWDER BURNS

06:59.294 --> 07:01.126
WHEN YOU GAVE
YOUR TESTIMONY.

07:01.212 --> 07:04.750
AND YOUR COURAGEOUS EDITOR
HERE IN COVERING THE TRIAL

07:04.841 --> 07:08.755
DIDN'T SEE FIT TO INCLUDE
THIS INSIGNIFICANT ADDENDUM

07:08.845 --> 07:13.089
THOUGH HE ALSO KNEVV AT THE TIME
HE VVAS BEING VERY SELECTIVE

07:13.183 --> 07:17.677
ABOUT VVHAT TRUTHS HE VVAS WRITING
ABOUT, VVHAT TRUTHS HE VVASN'T.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.353
YOU'RE RIGHT, DEPUTY.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.350
<i>JUSTICE IS
BEING SERVED...</i>

07:21.441 --> 07:24.183
ON A PLATTER WITH
ITS TONGUE CUT OUT

07:24.277 --> 07:28.316
JUST LIKE THE CARCASS
OF ANY DEAD ANIMAL.

07:37.874 --> 07:43.210
LET ME KNOW WHEN
YOU'RE READY.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.458
IT'S PITCH BLACK OUTSIDE.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.710
ALMOST 8:00
IN THE MORNING.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.838
NOT A SPECK
OF DAYLIGHT.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.386
THIS PLACE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY WINDOWS

07:52.472 --> 07:54.304
SO IT COULD
BE CHRISTMAS EVE

07:54.391 --> 07:55.847
OR THE FOURTH OF JULY

07:55.934 --> 07:58.301
AND I WOULD NOT KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

07:58.395 --> 08:01.729
YOU GOT ANY RELIGIOUS
AFFILIATION, JAGGER?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.397
NONE.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.394
ANYONE YOU WANT TO SEE?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.067
NOBODY.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.987
ANYTHING TO SAY?

08:11.074 --> 08:13.816
NOTHING.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.322
NO PRIEST, NO FRIENDS,
NO COMMENT.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.745
JUST WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT, JAGGER?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.414
I GOT THE BLUES, MR. COLBEY!

08:20.500 --> 08:22.161
I GOT THE BLUES.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.334
I'M JUST ABOUT AN HOUR
AVVAY FROM A HANGING

08:24.421 --> 08:26.003
AND I'VE BEEN LYING THERE

08:26.089 --> 08:27.875
AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING
THAT I WOULD LIKE

08:27.966 --> 08:32.506
TO RIP THESE BARS APART
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.428
OR I'D LIKE TO SAVE
EVERYBODY ELSE THE TROUBLE

08:35.515 --> 08:38.758
AND HANG MYSELF
RIGHT HERE.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.683
BUT I DON'T HAVE
THE STRENGTH FOR ONE

08:40.770 --> 08:42.852
OR THE GUTS
FOR THE OTHER

08:42.897 --> 08:48.358
SO I'M JUST LYING THERE,
AND I AM JUST WAITING.

08:48.445 --> 08:52.188
VVELL, IN THAT CASE, VVOULD
YOU CARE TO MAKE A STATEMENT

08:52.282 --> 08:54.239
ABOUT GUILT
OR INNOCENCE?

08:54.325 --> 08:57.454
GUILT OR INNOCENCE, AND YOU
VVANT ME TO MAKE A STATEMENT?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.198
<i>I'D APPRECIATE ONE.</i>

08:59.289 --> 09:01.200
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
SHOULD LEAVE THIS EARTH

09:01.291 --> 09:04.374
VVITHOUT MAKING A
COMMENT-YOU, ME, ANYBODY.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.543
WELL, THAT'S A REASONABLE
REQUEST, MR. COLBEY.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.212
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING THIS MORNING

09:09.299 --> 09:10.289
IT'S REASONABLE.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.469
I'M GUILTY, MR. COLBEY.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.798
THAT TAKE YOU
OFF THE HOOK?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.224
AND THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MEAN WHAT?

09:21.311 --> 09:22.893
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MEAN

09:22.979 --> 09:24.640
YOU'RE ON THE
POPULAR SIDE.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.813
THERE ARE GOOD GUYS
AND BAD GUYS--

09:26.900 --> 09:28.311
THAT'S THE NATURE OF MAN.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.233
WELL, I'M WORSE
THAN A BAD GUY.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.152
I'M A TOWN KOOK,
I'M A NEUROTIC.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.491
I'M THE ONE VVITH THE
CAUSES AND THE BANNERS.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.532

09:48.171 --> 09:50.333
DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
MR. COLBEY?

09:50.423 --> 09:53.916
THE MAN I KILLED WAS
THE WHITE KNIGHT.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.585
<i>HE DID WHAT HIS OTHER
PALS IN THIS TOWN</i>

09:56.679 --> 09:59.091
<i>WANTED TO DO AND
DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS.</i>

09:59.182 --> 10:02.015
<i>HE WAS THE CROSS BURNER,
THE BOMB THROWER.</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:08.018
<i>HE</i> HANDLED THE VVHIPPING OF
SOME POOR, SCARED COLORED GUY.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.442
OH...

10:11.528 --> 10:13.110
THE MAN YOU KILLED
WAS NO SAINT

10:13.196 --> 10:15.028
BUT WE DON'T DISPENSE
LIFE OR DEATH

10:15.115 --> 10:16.947
JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY
OFFENDS US.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.483
THAT'S THE DISTINCTION
BETWEEN MEN AND ANIMALS.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.955
OH, WELL, THAT'S
VERY WELL SAID.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.370
THAT'S VERY WELL SAID,

10:24.457 --> 10:25.959
<i>YOU TELL THAT

10:26.042 --> 10:27.624
<i>WHO'S GONNA
FIX MY ROPE.</i>

10:27.710 --> 10:30.122
YOU TELL IT TO THE SHERIFF
AND HIS DEPUTY

TO THE TOVVNSPEOPLE VVHO
ARE GOING TO STAND AROUND

10:33.299 --> 10:36.212
<i>AND WATCH MY EYES BULGE
OUT AND ENJOY MY AGONY.</i>

10:36.302 --> 10:39.135
