WEBVTT

00:54.291 --> 00:57.541
Taking me
to see basketball or a cockfight?

00:57.625 --> 00:58.916
We do everything.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.958
Okay.

01:21.208 --> 01:22.250
Big boy.

01:24.458 --> 01:25.666
He's coming.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.833
Do we back up? He's gonna take us out.

01:28.416 --> 01:30.833
-Oh-oh!

01:30.916 --> 01:33.666
Uh-huh. What? What did he say?

01:33.750 --> 01:35.041
He wants to go to the NBA.

01:35.125 --> 01:36.750
-Yeah, that's why we're here.
-Mm-hmm.

01:37.416 --> 01:38.750
Very impressive. Tell him.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.666
-Just a big man who makes shots.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.541
-He would be in the rotation right now.

01:46.458 --> 01:50.125
And be a force,
he would be a powerhouse in the league.

01:51.041 --> 01:53.875
I do have to ask something.

01:53.958 --> 01:57.500
So it says in my files,
you're 22 years old.

01:57.583 --> 01:58.875
Da. Da.

01:58.958 --> 02:01.166
-Yeah.
-It's accurate? You're 22 years old?

02:01.250 --> 02:02.375
Yes, I'm 22 years old.

02:02.458 --> 02:04.750
The reason I'm asking…
He's speaking English?

02:04.833 --> 02:07.458
-Yeah.
-You understand my English?

02:07.541 --> 02:10.458
Because you can't be
in the draft if you're over 22,

02:10.541 --> 02:13.375
if you're from overseas.
Do you have a birth certificate?

02:14.125 --> 02:15.208
It was big fire.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.166
Oh. Okay.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.041
-Who's this?
-It's my son.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.583
-It's your son?
-Yes.

02:23.375 --> 02:25.875
-How old is he?
-He's ten years old.

02:28.958 --> 02:31.541

Good to see ya.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.916
-Yeah. Who you've been dating?
-Yeah. Come on, Dad.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.833
-You're not dating?
-I'd never tell you who I was dating.

05:37.916 --> 05:39.708
-Just a second.
-Okay.

05:39.791 --> 05:42.041
Hi. Wow, you look tired.

05:42.125 --> 05:45.916
-I had a red-eye.
-How was the German MJ?

05:46.500 --> 05:48.625
I'm about to get into all that.
You're not staying?

05:48.708 --> 05:50.375
I have an- 30 call with Adam Silver.

05:50.458 --> 05:51.708
You didn't like the kid?

05:53.166 --> 05:55.708
Oh… shit.

05:55.791 --> 05:56.875
Good luck, Sugerman.

05:56.958 --> 05:59.208
-Please don't go.

05:59.291 --> 06:01.000
Okay. Goodbye.

06:02.041 --> 06:04.541
Kid can score at will.
Makes shots from all over the floor.

06:04.625 --> 06:05.583
A match-up nightmare.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.208
His true shooting percentage,
same as Steph's was at Davidson.

06:08.291 --> 06:11.375
-You're taking it too far.
-He's just reading the stats, Billy.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.458
I think Doc will like
the way this kid can pass.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.625
You've seen him pass before?
I've never seen him pass.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.500
He's playing with scrubs.
His best chance to win is to shoot.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.333
With us, he'll adapt.

06:20.416 --> 06:22.416
We've done the modeling.
He checks every box.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.083
In three years he could be an All-Star.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.458
Rex, you want to win now,
or in three years?

06:26.541 --> 06:28.416
-We want to win now.
-Yeah…

06:28.500 --> 06:31.333
Offensively, there's a lot to like,
but I don't think--

06:31.416 --> 06:33.000
So what's not to like, Stanley?

06:33.583 --> 06:35.708
Berlin loses a lot.

06:35.791 --> 06:38.208
Three games
this guy didn't show up to, they won.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.500
They're better off when he's on the bench.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.500
You check out the efficiency stats I sent?

06:42.583 --> 06:44.958
-I actually have the stats, Stan.
-Thank you.

06:45.041 --> 06:48.041
Everyone in Germany is saying
this guy'll be the next Dirk.

06:48.125 --> 06:51.041
Dirk never left the gym.
This guy shows up late to warm-ups.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.125
The kid can defend all five positions.

06:53.208 --> 06:56.500
He's physically capable of it.
He just gets bored out there.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.000
I've been to Germany four times
in the last two months.

06:59.083 --> 07:01.125
I've yet to see him make a third effort.

07:01.625 --> 07:02.916
He's late on rotations.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.375
Always bitching at refs,
bitching at teammates.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.916
He's bitching because he cares.
He wants to win.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.666
We've all seen the tape.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.583
Referring to the highlights
his mother put together?

07:12.666 --> 07:15.333
Like the Bargnani tape
you tried to trade up with?

07:16.708 --> 07:18.666
-That's too soon.
-Shit.

07:18.750 --> 07:24.500
Listen, Dad, he's a 19-year-old, 7-footer
with a 35-foot range and a guard's handle.

07:26.125 --> 07:29.875
I see him in another team's jersey,
I'm gonna goddamn kill someone.

07:29.958 --> 07:30.875
Yeah.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.416
Cool.

07:51.583 --> 07:53.375
-Yes, sir.
-Get in.

07:54.791 --> 07:55.833
Okay.

07:56.875 --> 08:00.250
So, I'm not drafting Haas.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.833
Your son's gonna kill somebody.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.208
Yeah, maybe you.

08:05.208 --> 08:07.125
You shouldn't have backed down to him.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.625
No, no, no, I didn't.

08:08.708 --> 08:11.958
I didn't back down. I was just
trying to save everybody some time.

08:12.041 --> 08:13.958
I remember when you were at Temple.

08:14.041 --> 08:16.250
I think it was the second game
of the season,

08:16.333 --> 08:17.833
and we were playing Saint Joe,

08:18.666 --> 08:21.916
and some guy took Leon's knees out.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.791
Marlon Daly.
I can't believe you remember that.

08:24.875 --> 08:27.250
I remember you knocking him
into the second row

08:27.333 --> 08:31.333
and then having to be held back
from fighting that entire team.

08:31.416 --> 08:35.250
That's the reason I brought you in,
because you never took anybody's shit.

08:37.166 --> 08:41.583
Rex, you're right.
I should have pushed back more.

08:41.666 --> 08:43.500
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

08:44.166 --> 08:45.166
No, it won't.

08:46.250 --> 08:48.750
Karl, could you pull around
to the back, please?

08:56.666 --> 08:58.458
After I bought the team,

08:58.541 --> 09:00.083
this was before your time,

09:00.166 --> 09:03.041
I gave this office to my Uncle Connie.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.000
He helped out with everything,

09:05.083 --> 09:06.375
worked every day.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.583
Sorry, I didn't make it happen
for you sooner.

09:11.875 --> 09:14.708
I know it's not on the bench,
but it's behind the bench.

09:17.708 --> 09:19.375
So what do you think?

09:20.375 --> 09:23.208
I can't believe you made
your uncle work in this closet.

09:27.291 --> 09:28.208
Thank you.

09:29.416 --> 09:32.458
Feels like I've been waiting
my whole life to become a coach.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.166
Come here.

09:34.750 --> 09:35.583
Come.

09:40.666 --> 09:41.833
Never back down.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.291
-Yes, sir.
-All right?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.250
-I won't.
-Yeah. Yeah.

09:47.458 --> 09:48.333
Right.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.541
Look at the berries.

09:56.625 --> 09:58.791
You need to zoom out
so they can see the whole thing.

09:59.583 --> 10:00.833
Mom, no one uses filters.

10:00.916 --> 10:02.541
I can't eat that whole cake.

10:02.625 --> 10:04.333
Looks like you already did.

10:04.416 --> 10:09.375
Wow, what a lovely welcome home.
I missed you guys too.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.458
Welcome back. Welcome back. Okay.

10:11.541 --> 10:15.125
Not a side hug. What's with the side hug?
When did you stop hugging me?

10:15.208 --> 10:16.833
Honey, you gotta be more gentle.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.625
-Your baby's got titties now.
-That's disgusting.

10:19.708 --> 10:22.291
I don't want to hear about that.
That's between you two.

10:22.375 --> 10:25.458
Dad, can I go to the cemetery tonight?
They're showing Evil Dead.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.875
I told you I love that movie. Absolutely.

10:27.958 --> 10:29.166
No, she can't.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.125
No, you can't. Why can't she?

10:31.208 --> 10:33.583
She never finished her presentation
on the Homestead Act.

10:33.666 --> 10:34.708
Didn't finish. Why?

10:35.416 --> 10:36.458
I don't know.

10:36.541 --> 10:38.375
Okay, here's what we'll do.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.958
You can go to the movie tonight.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.041
-Oh, wow.
-Yes.

10:42.125 --> 10:46.250
No. No, no. But all weekend long,
it's just you, your history books.

10:46.333 --> 10:49.041
Sunday night,
I want a TED Talk on the Homestead Act.

10:49.125 --> 10:50.750
-Fine. Yes.
-All right?

10:50.833 --> 10:52.041
-Okay. Cool.
-Thank you.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.125
-I love you. Now can I get a hug?
-Love you too.

10:54.208 --> 10:55.875
-No.
-No? No, hug.

10:55.958 --> 10:57.083
Why would you do that?

10:57.166 --> 10:58.416
Because I was happy

10:58.500 --> 11:00.750
she was actually excited
about something for a change.

11:00.833 --> 11:03.916
And to be honest with you,
I… I wanted to be alone with you.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.583
You think you'll get some love
after that bullshit you just pulled?

11:07.666 --> 11:08.583
Hell, no.

11:08.666 --> 11:10.750
-I have some good news.

11:10.833 --> 11:13.083
You might even like me again
once you hear it.

11:13.708 --> 11:14.708
You are looking at…

11:14.791 --> 11:18.000
Well, you're not looking,
but you're going to look soon,

11:18.083 --> 11:20.916
at the new assistant coach…

11:22.250 --> 11:24.666
…for the Philadelphia 76ers.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.625
Thanks for everything.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.041
Oh.

11:38.666 --> 11:42.666
-Stanley, Stanley.
-Yep. Yep.

11:42.750 --> 11:46.291
-AC! AC!
-We did it. We did it.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.625
-We did it.
-"No! Get down there!"

11:48.708 --> 11:51.333
-"Get your ass up! Get your ass here!"
-That's right.

11:51.416 --> 11:54.791
-Yo, check this out.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.375
This video is trending again.

11:56.458 --> 11:59.916
Dr. J still dunking when he was 63.
Isn't that nuts?

12:00.000 --> 12:03.458
Yeah, you should put your phone away,
though, because you're driving.

12:03.541 --> 12:04.583
Yeah, that's true.

12:04.666 --> 12:06.583
But just look at the hops on that guy.

12:06.666 --> 12:08.000
There was nobody like him.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.250
-That's cool.
-Mm-hmm.

12:13.291 --> 12:15.541
What's going on with school?
How's that going?

12:15.625 --> 12:17.208
It's, um…

12:18.291 --> 12:19.250
Nothing. It's fine.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.500
In all honesty,
what do we feel about college?

12:21.583 --> 12:23.208
Is that something you want to do?

12:23.291 --> 12:25.375
You talked about going to film school.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.458
So many kids are applying to film schools.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.416
They're not going to pick me.

12:31.500 --> 12:35.583
Oh, I'm not worried about all those
other kids. I'm worried about you.

12:35.666 --> 12:37.166
You against you, baby.

12:37.250 --> 12:40.291
You can get it done.
You just gotta do what you love.

12:40.375 --> 12:42.291
Did you love being away
from home all the time?

12:42.916 --> 12:45.208
-That's what you got out of this.

12:45.291 --> 12:47.875
Of course,
I hated being away from home,

12:47.958 --> 12:51.166
but now that I'm coaching,
I'm going to be around a lot more.

12:51.250 --> 12:54.458
So we're going to get your grades up.
Together. Okay.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.583
-Love you. Bye.
-I love you.

12:56.666 --> 12:58.375
Have a good time with these guys.

12:59.166 --> 13:01.750
Hi! I'm so excited! Hi!

13:02.750 --> 13:06.875
No side hugs for them.
That's just for me? I love that.

13:07.541 --> 13:10.500
Girls. I know you since kindergarten,
none of you say hi?

13:10.583 --> 13:11.500
Bye, Dad.

Good evening, everybody,
Anthony Gargano here,

13:23.291 --> 13:24.458
I've got breaking news.

13:24.541 --> 13:27.541
And it's very, very sad news.
I've just confirmed it.

13:28.291 --> 13:29.708
I don't even want to say it.

13:30.625 --> 13:34.166
But Rex Merrick, you know our beloved Rex,

13:34.250 --> 13:36.666
owner of the Sixers,
has passed away tonight.

13:37.375 --> 13:38.791
I'm at a loss for words.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.250
He was one of the great people.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.583
He was one of our people.

13:46.375 --> 13:49.458
He grew up dirt poor
in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.541
He was just like
everybody else in his town.

13:54.375 --> 14:00.041
He built great wealth,
but he never distanced himself from us.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.958
And this is why we lost a great one today.

14:06.291 --> 14:09.375
-So Rex, this is for you.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.583
Hi, I'm not here right now.

14:14.666 --> 14:17.375

and I'll get back to you when I can.

-Hey.

14:41.833 --> 14:43.791
-Julius.
-Hey.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.625
Rex loved you, man.

14:45.708 --> 14:46.708
Thanks, pal.

14:46.791 --> 14:51.708
I just, I can't believe… I just showed
my daughter footage of you jamming,

14:51.791 --> 14:54.583
and it just brought back
so many nice memories.

14:54.666 --> 14:55.916
You can't let 'em forget.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.791
-Right, Stanley?
-No, no.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.791
I'll let you old friends catch up.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.666
-Okay. Stay well.
-Thank you.

15:02.916 --> 15:04.541
-Nice touch with the suit.
-Yeah.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.791
Leon, man, I can't believe this.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.791
Anything you ever need, call me, man.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.500
Yeah. I got to make the rounds.
I appreciate you.

15:11.583 --> 15:13.583
-Love you, bro.
-Love you too, Leon.

15:13.666 --> 15:14.916
Let's talk soon, 22.

15:18.625 --> 15:21.791
Trying to think of something to say to you
besides "I'm sorry."

15:21.875 --> 15:23.291
It doesn't seem enough.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.541
I heard you're moving to the bench.

15:28.166 --> 15:32.208
Uncle Connie's office.
Dad was so excited for you.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.250
"We need a spark, Katherine."

15:34.333 --> 15:35.625
No, man.

15:35.708 --> 15:36.541
Your father,

15:37.458 --> 15:40.625
he mentioned it to me years ago,
but with my past, you know,

15:41.625 --> 15:43.625
I figured he'd rather forget about it.

15:44.541 --> 15:46.333
He'd never forget about you, Sugerman.

15:49.791 --> 15:53.208
So my brother's going to be
taking over the team.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.166
You're bailing on us?

15:55.250 --> 15:57.208
No, I'm gonna keep my seat on the board.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.833
Vin's going to run the day-to-day.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.791
-To your pops.
-To Rex.

16:03.458 --> 16:04.958
He really wants this.

16:20.583 --> 16:24.291
Come on, Haas, make him work.
Too easy, Haas, too easy!

16:24.375 --> 16:26.250
-Come on, Haas.
-Whoa, whoa.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.083
No, can't have your arm
straight like that.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.333
Put your forearm into T's back, all right?

16:30.416 --> 16:33.500
Dig it in there. Okay?
You decide where you want him to go.

16:33.583 --> 16:34.750
Like Jrue Holiday, bro.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.000
Exactly. Take him out of his comfort zone.

16:38.333 --> 16:41.666
-Huh? I don't understand what that is.
-Did you sleep last night at all?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.916
-Do your work early.
-Let's go again.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.875
-Ready?
-Okay.

16:44.958 --> 16:48.958
-Come on, Haas. Make him work.
-Don't let him go baseline.

16:50.625 --> 16:51.541
Hey, just focus.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.500
-Go again!
-Make him work.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.833
Hey, Stan. You got a minute?

16:55.916 --> 16:57.458
You want me now?

16:57.541 --> 16:58.916
-Yeah.
-All right.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.375
How's he doing?

17:11.416 --> 17:14.875
We're working on it.
He's young. We're going to get him there.

17:16.666 --> 17:19.208
I fucked up. Shouldn't have drafted Haas.

17:19.291 --> 17:21.666
-I wouldn't say that.
-To my face?

17:21.750 --> 17:23.583
I would say it to your face.

17:24.833 --> 17:29.166
My father always appreciated your honesty.
I'm working on it. I really am.

17:30.416 --> 17:31.250
Cool.

17:31.333 --> 17:34.833
I have one job,
to maximize this team's chances

17:34.916 --> 17:37.833
of winning an NBA championship
by any means necessary.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.375
Hell with the naysayers. Right?

17:40.458 --> 17:41.708
You're not wrong.

17:41.791 --> 17:43.708
I'm glad to hear you say that.

17:43.791 --> 17:46.625
Got the Hawks' pick next year,
we can't afford to miss.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.583
To be champion requires sacrifice.

17:49.666 --> 17:52.166
Manu coming off the bench.
That's this. That's you.

17:52.791 --> 17:58.541
You're valuable as a coach,
you're indispensable as a scout.

17:58.625 --> 18:02.458
I don't want to be out there anymore.
I never wanted to be out there.

18:05.791 --> 18:06.958
I'm not asking.

18:09.750 --> 18:13.541
I haven't been home on my daughter's
birthday for nine years running, Vin.

18:17.541 --> 18:18.416
Stan.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.541
Find me that missing piece,
you're right back on the bench coaching.

18:37.125 --> 18:39.125
So what you gonna do, Sugerbear?

18:40.083 --> 18:41.000
What can I do?

18:41.500 --> 18:43.708
Call Vin right now and say,

18:43.791 --> 18:47.333
"Kiss my fat ass
and fuck your five-star hotels."

18:47.416 --> 18:48.666
You don't need this.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.708
It's not as simple as that.

18:52.375 --> 18:56.500
How can such a beautiful woman
have such horrifying feet?

18:57.083 --> 18:59.541
-What is this yellow thing?

18:59.625 --> 19:02.458
It's a callus from exercise.

19:02.541 --> 19:03.916
Remember exercise?

19:05.791 --> 19:08.500
So you're just gonna
give up on your dream?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.291
Guys in their 50s
don't have dreams.

19:12.375 --> 19:15.375
They have nightmares and eczema.

19:17.583 --> 19:22.000
There was only one guy who knew
what I was capable of, and he died.

19:22.083 --> 19:24.458
Welcome to Mallorca, Spain.

19:24.541 --> 19:27.875
The local temperature
is 30 degrees Celsius…

19:31.000 --> 19:33.916
Yo, Double Deuce,
I heard you back on that road, man.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.416
I'm in Spain too, with a client,
so let's have breakfast.

19:38.791 --> 19:41.333
Look at this pool. Check it out.

19:41.416 --> 19:44.083
-No, I can't look at that.
-Yeah, you can.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.750
No, that's going to get me in trouble.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.333
-One look, just one look.
-No. I'll get in…

19:48.416 --> 19:50.291
Teresa will kick the shit out of me.

19:50.375 --> 19:53.833
I swear to God, I saw
a Victoria's Secret mannequin one time,

19:53.916 --> 19:55.458
and T was pissed off at me.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.458
I came to talk to you about something.

19:58.541 --> 19:59.375
Okay.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.583
Why don't you come
and just be an agent with me?

20:01.666 --> 20:04.166
Got an open spot,
I got all the partners on board.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.125
For me?

20:05.791 --> 20:07.000
If I do that, then,

20:07.916 --> 20:10.375
there's no room for growth.
I still want to coach.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.708
This Philly thing,
there's room to grow there?

20:13.791 --> 20:15.916
At least I'm still in the league,
you know.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.958
Vin came to see me last week.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.000
Talk about Zeke.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.041
Talk about Zeke?
He's going one. We're out.

20:22.125 --> 20:25.625
He could trade up,
package Embiid with that King's pick.

20:26.333 --> 20:29.416
That idiot's talking about trading Embiid?
Are you kidding me?

20:29.500 --> 20:31.583
Look, nobody's safe now.

20:31.666 --> 20:34.583
Guy like Vin, he wants to put
his fingerprints on the team.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.333
Just think about my offer, Deuce.

20:37.375 --> 20:38.208
Yeah, I know.

20:38.291 --> 20:41.083
-I appreciate you looking out for me.
-Always, man.

20:41.166 --> 20:44.583
And do me a favor, please look
at these titties. I'll take the blame.

20:44.666 --> 20:47.083
-Just check them out.
-All right.

20:49.125 --> 20:51.250
-Those are my titties.
-Those are yours.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.625
-Yeah.
-They actually kind of look like yours.

20:53.708 --> 20:56.541
I'm about two sandwiches
away from those titties. Yeah.

21:00.250 --> 21:03.208
So how long has our boy
been off the injury reserve list?

21:03.291 --> 21:05.666
Garcia's knee's swollen.
He's not going to play.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.791
Swollen. Not gonna play.
What am I doing here, then?

21:08.875 --> 21:10.416
You don't wanna talk to Coach?

21:10.500 --> 21:11.875
What's he gonna tell me?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.375
There a place around here
I can shoot some hoop?

22:11.958 --> 22:13.416
They can't guard me.

22:46.166 --> 22:47.291
I'm guarding him.

22:47.791 --> 22:49.083
I got him.

22:49.166 --> 22:50.750
Who you guarding? Nobody!

23:12.958 --> 23:15.208
Tie game! Next point wins!

23:20.541 --> 23:21.875
Here's his chance.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.583
-Oh, my God!

23:34.000 --> 23:36.083
-What's the big guy's name?
-I don't know.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.416
You don't know?

23:40.458 --> 23:42.333
That was a bullshit foul.

23:42.416 --> 23:44.541
Give me my money.
That's my money. I won that match.

23:44.625 --> 23:46.541
-That's not your money.
-Where's my money?

23:47.125 --> 23:48.125
That's my money.

23:48.666 --> 23:50.541
What do you mean your money?

23:52.125 --> 23:53.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:02.583 --> 24:03.708
What are you looking at?

24:04.250 --> 24:05.083
Me?

24:06.291 --> 24:08.625
-Do you know who I am?
-You're a nobody.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.458
And you are shit.

24:10.541 --> 24:12.375
-You're a clown.

24:24.291 --> 24:27.750
You big piece of shit.
Fouling me all game.

24:27.833 --> 24:30.166
-You and me, one on one, right now.
-With those boots?

24:30.250 --> 24:31.291
Yeah, yeah.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.833
Twenty pavos for three shots.

24:38.125 --> 24:40.125
Three shots, he'll never hit the rim.

24:40.875 --> 24:42.000
Don't do it!

24:42.083 --> 24:43.666
The big dude is hustling you!

24:43.750 --> 24:45.041
He's fucking scared.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.750
There's one.

25:16.833 --> 25:17.916
God damn.

25:31.958 --> 25:32.958
That's it.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.791
Yo, yo, yo!

25:56.833 --> 25:57.666
Amigo.

26:02.208 --> 26:04.708
Shit. Shit. Shit.

26:14.833 --> 26:16.958
I haven't sprinted like that in 30 years.

26:17.791 --> 26:20.333
Just waiting for my Achilles to pop.

26:23.875 --> 26:24.958
Just…

26:26.041 --> 26:27.708
Uno momento. I have an idea.

26:31.416 --> 26:35.750
Are you really a construction worker,
or is that all part of the hustle?

26:42.625 --> 26:44.958
I mean, I couldn't
take my eyes off of you.

26:45.583 --> 26:47.041
It got me so excited.

26:47.625 --> 26:49.666
You're a fantasy for a guy like me.

26:59.208 --> 27:01.958
What? Did that sound dirty or something?

27:02.541 --> 27:03.750
No, I didn't…

27:04.375 --> 27:05.833
I didn't mean it like that.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.916
I meant it like you're
an amazing basketball player.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.291
Why you follow me here, you fucking crazy?

27:57.375 --> 27:58.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:58.958 --> 28:00.166
You understand English?

28:00.750 --> 28:04.500
I am a scout with the Sixers.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.458
You know the Sixers, correct?

28:06.541 --> 28:09.666
-Iverson, Barkley--

28:09.750 --> 28:12.416
Uh… Mom… Madre… Hi.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.333
Mi nombre Stanley Sugerman.

28:15.416 --> 28:18.375
Yo soy un basketball scout.

28:18.958 --> 28:22.041
Trabajo, eh, NBA…

28:23.166 --> 28:27.416
Hijo… is muy bien. Muy… Muy bien.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.250
She called me an old man.
Yes, I am an old man.

28:34.916 --> 28:37.583
Is that your daughter?
I have a daughter. She's older.

28:37.666 --> 28:40.208
She doesn't talk to me anymore.
Hang on. Hang on.

28:40.291 --> 28:41.791
I have an idea. Por favor.

28:42.375 --> 28:45.375
Let me just call…
I don't know what time it is there.

28:45.458 --> 28:47.541
I hope he's there. Please, God, be there.

28:47.625 --> 28:51.333
-Please. Please, please pick up. Pick up.

28:51.916 --> 28:52.916
God damn it.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.541
-Uh, hello?
-Hey, Schnitzel. I'm in Spain.

28:56.625 --> 28:58.541
I wanted you to meet somebody.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.833
Dirk Nowitzki. See?

29:01.416 --> 29:03.708
How's it going? How's the retirement home?

29:03.791 --> 29:05.375
They still feeding you pudding?

29:05.458 --> 29:07.833
Who is this? How'd you get this number?

29:07.916 --> 29:10.291
Yes.
All right. I deserved that.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.250
I don't know you.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.750
But I've never seen this man
before in my life.

29:14.458 --> 29:17.666
He's starting to believe you, Dirk.
Come on, help me out.

29:18.208 --> 29:22.041
Ah… I'm just kidding,
that's Stan the man right there.

29:22.125 --> 29:23.083
He's a legend.

29:23.166 --> 29:24.958
What's your name, kid?

29:25.041 --> 29:28.083
-Bo, Bo Cruz.
-Where you play at, Bo Cruz?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.125
Nowhere. I just work construction.

29:31.208 --> 29:33.625
Not for long
if Stan is calling me about you.

29:33.708 --> 29:37.250
That's right. You see,
this is mi amigo, amigo.

29:37.333 --> 29:40.625
Thank you so much, Dirk,
and say hi to your grandmother for me.

29:40.708 --> 29:42.041
My grandma died.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.375
That's right. You told me that. My bad.

29:57.916 --> 30:02.166
There's 450 NBA players,
another 100 just waiting to get called up.

30:02.250 --> 30:05.125
It's my job to know
every other great player in the world.

30:05.208 --> 30:06.458
I'm very good at my job.

30:07.208 --> 30:08.583
I never heard of you.

30:08.666 --> 30:10.875
So tell me your whole story from the top.

30:11.750 --> 30:14.416
-He was a very strong baby.
-Mama, no.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.041
Good, I said from the top.
This is nice. Go ahead.

30:17.125 --> 30:19.500
A very sweet boy.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.291
When he was ten years old,

30:21.375 --> 30:24.875
was his gym coach idea to do basketball.

30:24.958 --> 30:28.416
And the club teams,
they want him to play football.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.458
The gym coach was smart.

30:31.083 --> 30:32.875
Soccer is awful.

30:32.958 --> 30:36.416
But with basketball,
he played with the big kids

30:36.500 --> 30:38.166
when he was still small.

30:38.250 --> 30:39.791
Biggest hands, though.

30:39.875 --> 30:45.291
They tease him.
The… The movie with the little alien.

30:45.375 --> 30:46.458
Ehm…

30:47.958 --> 30:49.750
Phone home.

30:49.833 --> 30:53.083
-E.T.
-Yes. Very mean boys.

30:53.625 --> 30:54.625
But also,

30:55.541 --> 30:57.166
he kind of looked like an alien.

30:57.250 --> 31:00.958
-I bet.
-He played every day.

31:01.041 --> 31:03.208
After his father, well,

31:04.875 --> 31:07.125
he went away. We don't have him anymore.

31:07.875 --> 31:10.958
I'm sorry. Losing your dad at any age--

31:11.041 --> 31:14.041
Oh, no, he's not lost.
He moved to Portugal with whore.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.708
Mama, la niña.

31:15.791 --> 31:19.458
What? It's true, she knows.
After his father left…

31:21.083 --> 31:22.125
mi roble.

31:22.208 --> 31:24.416
Roble? Que es "roble"?

31:24.500 --> 31:27.500
My strong oak tree.

31:27.583 --> 31:28.500
Uh-huh.

31:28.583 --> 31:31.583
He played basketball all his time,
so he no think of him.

31:32.875 --> 31:36.166
He was invited to a club team
in America when he was 15,

31:37.083 --> 31:39.791
but before he left, Lucia's mother

31:41.000 --> 31:41.916
got pregnant.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.875
-So he stayed here for Lucia.
-Right.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.750
I'm gonna make a couple of calls
so I can see you play

31:50.833 --> 31:52.708
with some guys on your level tomorrow.

31:52.791 --> 31:54.166
I got to work.

31:54.750 --> 31:56.000
How old are you?

31:56.083 --> 31:59.083
-Twenty-two.
-Basketball years are like dog years.

31:59.166 --> 32:01.958
We're gonna do this,
we actually got to do this now.

32:03.041 --> 32:06.875
-And how much money will you pay him?
-To come to Philly?

32:06.958 --> 32:09.458
It'll be a prorated league minimum.

32:09.541 --> 32:10.833
But you say he was great.

32:10.916 --> 32:12.958
For great, you pay the maximum, no?

32:13.041 --> 32:18.583
Yeah. Yes, NBA contract
of any kind is maximum, no?

32:20.375 --> 32:25.833
-And how much is the minimum?
-Minimum salary in the NBA is $900,000.

32:27.041 --> 32:28.250
He will call in sick.

32:28.333 --> 32:31.083
All right.
I'll text you the details in the morning.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.833
What a pleasure.

32:32.916 --> 32:35.166
Bo Cruz. Love the name.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.083
Doing good, Stanley?
You look nervous.

32:48.166 --> 32:51.375
I'm not nervous.
I'm just very excited, Coach.

32:51.458 --> 32:52.833
When is your kid coming in?

32:53.541 --> 32:55.583
Don't know. His bus must be running late.

32:55.666 --> 32:56.791
He doesn't have a car.

32:59.250 --> 33:00.083
Right on time.

33:00.958 --> 33:03.375
Here's my man, the Cruz Missile.

33:04.750 --> 33:05.791
-What?

33:05.875 --> 33:08.125
You don't like that?
I thought you'd love that.

33:08.208 --> 33:09.750
No? I'll keep thinking.

33:09.833 --> 33:12.541
So I want you to meet Coach Scariolo.

33:12.625 --> 33:14.833
-You know him. Spanish national team.
-¿Qué tal?

33:14.916 --> 33:16.083
-Hola.
-Bo Cruz.

33:16.166 --> 33:17.375
Felipe. Álex.

33:17.458 --> 33:20.583
These guys are being nice.
They're gonna let you play with 'em.

33:20.666 --> 33:24.916
Willy, José, Pierre. Bo Cruz.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.708
Go on down and get laced up,
stretch out a little bit.

33:27.791 --> 33:29.291
We're going to have some fun.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.458
You want to try?

33:41.041 --> 33:43.541
Willy, you're off the team.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.250
Yo, get some sneakers on.

33:45.333 --> 33:46.500
Be careful.

33:50.583 --> 33:52.833
-He can jump.
-Yeah, he can jump.

33:54.375 --> 33:58.875
You believe this?
He hit 44 out of 50 from the side pocket.

33:58.958 --> 34:00.250
He's incredible!

34:00.333 --> 34:01.625
You watch the workout?

34:01.708 --> 34:03.791
Of course, I watched.
Kid's impressive.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.083
But there are other considerations.

34:06.166 --> 34:08.791
Character, mentality.
Playing within a system.

34:08.875 --> 34:10.416
I sound like you right now.

34:10.500 --> 34:13.291
Vin, this kid is the new Freak.

34:13.375 --> 34:15.750
He's a unicorn, a mythical creature.

34:15.833 --> 34:20.375
The kid hasn't played
organized basketball in eight years.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.958
There's a reason for that.

34:22.041 --> 34:26.541
-Let's see what he can do in the G League.
-You fucking play in the G League, Blake.

34:26.625 --> 34:29.083
All right, listen to me, Vin.

34:29.166 --> 34:30.875
Nobody knows about him.

34:31.666 --> 34:34.791
You're going to see this guy,
you're gonna freak the fuck out.

34:34.875 --> 34:36.958
I promise you, you have to see him live.

34:38.791 --> 34:40.208
It's not gonna happen, Stan.

34:43.458 --> 34:44.875
I'm indispensable.

34:45.791 --> 34:47.208
So valuable, right?

34:47.291 --> 34:50.708
You told me if I wanted to get back
on the bench to find the missing piece.

34:50.791 --> 34:53.625
Well, here I am delivering him
for no money.

34:53.708 --> 34:55.041
And it's not gonna happen?

34:55.833 --> 34:59.166
I pay you to find players,
not tell me what to do with them.

34:59.750 --> 35:00.625
Pay me.

35:02.916 --> 35:04.500
You got something to say, Stan?

35:13.541 --> 35:14.750
I don't understand.

35:14.833 --> 35:18.041
It's all good. It's just they
don't have a roster spot at the moment,

35:18.125 --> 35:20.291
but they love what they saw
and want to see more.

35:20.375 --> 35:22.750
And let's just say a spot doesn't open up,

35:22.833 --> 35:24.500
we'll get your name in the draft.

35:24.583 --> 35:28.208
So you play like you did yesterday,
at the combine, you'll be a lock.

35:28.291 --> 35:29.916
They still pay me to come.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.500
They'll pay you for sure.

35:31.583 --> 35:34.625
It might not come at once,
but you'll get the money.

35:34.708 --> 35:36.125
-I promise you.
-Okay.

35:38.625 --> 35:41.666
Giant body like yours
on an eight-hour flight is gonna be rough.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.333
You'll take my seat, okay?

35:43.416 --> 35:45.416
-Oh, really?
-Okay. Yeah, no problem.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.083
This is your captain speaking.

35:47.166 --> 35:50.708
I'd like to welcome everyone aboard
Flight 718. We're currently cruising at…

36:08.875 --> 36:12.333
Psst, Stanley. Stanley. Here.

36:12.416 --> 36:13.958
Look what I got.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.708
-Oh, yes.
-They are warm.

36:17.333 --> 36:19.333
-That's good.
-You want some?

36:19.416 --> 36:23.833
Uh… I don't want to start a riot
back here. It's cool, thanks.

36:23.916 --> 36:27.166
-One bite?
-No, I'm trying not to, badly.

36:27.250 --> 36:30.625
-It's really good.
-Just give me a fucking roll. Thank you.

36:38.541 --> 36:39.500
Next, please.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.500
Sir, I need you to come with me.

36:53.666 --> 36:55.541
Oh, hey, that's my kid.

36:56.125 --> 37:01.000
Yo, excuse me.
No, no, he's with me. He's with me.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.666
What's up, Oscar? What happened?

37:16.750 --> 37:19.541
He got flagged
for an aggravated assault charge.

37:20.333 --> 37:22.083
Beat up a guy pretty bad five years ago.

37:22.166 --> 37:24.958
-Ah, Jesus.
-He needs to be very careful.

37:25.041 --> 37:27.875
He goes in front of a judge
for even running a stop sign,

37:27.958 --> 37:29.958
he can get his visa permanently revoked.

37:30.041 --> 37:31.666
Right. Okay.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.666
Are you looking at him for the draft?

37:33.750 --> 37:37.875
Yeah. We're all very excited about him.
This is something I should have caught.

37:37.958 --> 37:40.125
I don't want the team
paying for my mistake.

37:40.208 --> 37:43.875
So keep this between us.
I'll cover your hours.

37:43.958 --> 37:46.958
No problem. Just bring us back home
a championship, right?

37:47.041 --> 37:48.458
-Will do, Oscar.
-Good.

37:48.541 --> 37:49.458
Thank you.

37:50.250 --> 37:51.083
Fuck.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.166
Anything else you need to tell me?
Now is the time.

37:54.958 --> 37:56.666
We all have stuff from our past,

37:56.750 --> 38:00.625
but having a criminal record's
a pretty big detail to leave out.

38:01.625 --> 38:05.000
No more secrets
from now on, all right?

38:05.083 --> 38:06.333
No big deal, moving on.

38:07.333 --> 38:08.458
I got you this,

38:09.500 --> 38:12.083
for local and international calls.

38:12.166 --> 38:13.750
You can talk to your daughter anytime.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.375
-Thanks, Stanley.
-Philadelphia, baby.

38:16.458 --> 38:19.083
You're gonna love it.

He wanted to call his daughter.

38:41.125 --> 38:42.875
I gave him money. He's settling in.

38:42.958 --> 38:45.500
So when are you taking this,
what's his name again?

38:45.583 --> 38:46.500
Bo Cruz.

38:46.583 --> 38:49.750
When are you taking Bo
across the river to train with the team?

38:49.833 --> 38:52.500
I don't know
if I want to give them this guy yet.

38:52.583 --> 38:55.083

I do what's right for the kid.

38:57.875 --> 38:58.791

38:59.958 --> 39:02.208
The Sixers don't know you stashed him.

39:03.875 --> 39:09.000
You don't get it. The kid is like
if Scottie Pippen and a wolf had a baby.

39:10.041 --> 39:12.083
So what are you saying?
He has a hairy face.

39:12.166 --> 39:14.666
I'm saying if this kid puts it together,

39:14.750 --> 39:18.125

Hey, what are you doing?

40:14.500 --> 40:17.333
-Careful, please.

40:20.375 --> 40:23.125
All right, that's it. That's it.

40:25.333 --> 40:26.708
Take your money.

40:27.291 --> 40:28.125
Goodness.

40:29.583 --> 40:31.750
I see. We're not here to hustle, man.

40:32.625 --> 40:33.625
Why not?

40:34.666 --> 40:35.583
Let's go.

40:40.958 --> 40:42.083
Good Lord.

40:42.916 --> 40:44.208
-Why?
-Hey, Stanley.

40:44.291 --> 40:46.375
Have you ever tried these Ishkabibble's?

40:46.458 --> 40:48.250
Oh, my God.

40:48.333 --> 40:52.125
Yeah, but you got five cheese steaks.

40:52.208 --> 40:53.875
Yeah, but each one is different.

40:53.958 --> 40:56.416
But you only took
one bite of each one.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.750
You take one bite and you don't eat
it all, because if not, you get fat.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.666
Why did you look at me when you said that?

41:01.750 --> 41:04.416
-Come on, Stanley, I don't say that.
-Okay.

41:05.458 --> 41:07.916
What the fuck did you do to the minibar?

41:08.000 --> 41:09.875
Sixers are paying, don't worry.

41:09.958 --> 41:13.916
Yes, but we don't eat $9 Pringles.
A man must have a code.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.583
I literally eat one chip.
They are not that good.

41:16.666 --> 41:19.791
It's still $9.
They don't charge you per chip.

41:20.375 --> 41:23.416
Okay. Anyways, I got some good news.

41:23.500 --> 41:27.541
-Um, an old friend, Leon Rich…
-Leon Rich who played for Timberwolves?

41:27.625 --> 41:29.625
Right. We played together in college.

41:29.708 --> 41:34.000
He's a power agent now, and he's in Philly
with a few of his guys for an open run.

41:34.083 --> 41:35.625
Like, who are these guys?

41:35.708 --> 41:39.333
College kids.
NBA prospects getting ready for the draft.

41:39.416 --> 41:41.916
It's a scrimmage,
but it gets serious out there.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.958
So it's like a real tryout?

41:45.666 --> 41:46.625
No, no, no.

41:46.708 --> 41:50.416
It's just a showcase, not a big deal,
just a step in the process.

41:50.500 --> 41:54.208
The whole idea is to give
young bucks a place to shine.

41:54.291 --> 41:57.333
So you're just gonna go out there,
and you're gonna shine, Bo Cruz.

41:59.208 --> 42:01.291
Okay, let's go.

42:01.375 --> 42:04.166
♪ What you want now? I'm the one now ♪

42:04.250 --> 42:06.625

42:18.125 --> 42:19.166
Stanley.

42:20.791 --> 42:21.708
Come here.

42:23.500 --> 42:26.166
-Hey, Matisse, Kyle.
-'Sup?

42:26.250 --> 42:30.041
Bo. This is Vin Merrick.
He's co-owner of the Sixers,

42:30.125 --> 42:32.000
but he basically runs the team.

42:32.583 --> 42:35.291
And Leon Rich, basically,
he runs the world.

42:35.375 --> 42:37.708
The Double Deuce
told me a lot about you, man.

42:37.791 --> 42:39.000
Oh, yeah, Bo Cruz.

42:39.083 --> 42:43.750
We certainly have heard a lot about you
from Stanley, and Oscar Morales.

42:43.833 --> 42:46.250
Our in-house counsel,
he met you at the airport.

42:47.250 --> 42:50.541
Yeah, they met. Go get laced up, bud.

42:51.416 --> 42:53.500
-Huge fan.
-Thanks, man.

42:53.583 --> 42:55.708
-How you know he's talking about you?
-Come on.

42:56.666 --> 42:58.458
Sorry, but I had to bring him.

42:58.541 --> 43:00.833
You're going to see why
after you watch the kid play.

43:04.916 --> 43:05.875
Good luck.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.791
Appreciate it.

43:08.875 --> 43:10.000
Fellas.

43:12.250 --> 43:15.416
What is Kermit Wilts doing here?
The guy's a lock at two.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.208
He thinks he should be number one.

43:19.791 --> 43:22.875
He can shoot from anywhere.
Just stay with him wherever he goes.

43:22.958 --> 43:25.875
Don't let him score in bunches.
Don't let him get hot. Okay?

43:25.958 --> 43:29.666
He's here to show off.
Use that. Get physical with him.

43:29.750 --> 43:34.166
You give Kermit Wilts the business, your
whole world's going to change overnight.

43:34.750 --> 43:37.250
You got this shit, go get it.

43:45.541 --> 43:46.958
Best of luck out there, man.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.625
-What's your name?
-Bo.

43:49.708 --> 43:52.583
Bo. I like that.
Strong, strong like a bull.

43:54.416 --> 43:56.958
Let's give these people a show.
What do you say, Bo?

43:57.833 --> 43:59.250
So, where are you from?

44:00.541 --> 44:01.458
Spain.

44:02.416 --> 44:03.458
Shit sounds wack.

44:05.166 --> 44:07.250
Y'all like bull fights over there, right?

44:08.416 --> 44:11.291
So, here's what's going to happen.
You're the bull.

44:11.375 --> 44:14.916
I'm the motherfucker with a cape running
your big dumb ass in circles. That's cool.

44:15.833 --> 44:16.833
Let's get it.

44:25.250 --> 44:26.375
Get up on him, baby.

44:29.708 --> 44:30.958
Stay with him.

44:38.958 --> 44:40.083
We're good.

44:43.833 --> 44:44.916
Right here.

44:45.541 --> 44:47.500
Go ahead, make something happen.

44:53.666 --> 44:56.250
That's it. Yes, sir.

44:57.125 --> 44:58.666
-Who's this?
-Stan brought him.

44:58.750 --> 45:00.083
Nice vision.

45:09.208 --> 45:10.750
Welcome to America.

45:16.750 --> 45:19.250
-Hey, hey.

45:19.333 --> 45:20.666
I don't need no help.

45:28.208 --> 45:30.208
That's it. Nice.

45:30.291 --> 45:32.125
I like-- I like him. I like him.

45:34.875 --> 45:36.000
This is gonna be good.

45:37.958 --> 45:40.583
He's got a lot of length.
Does he have any control?

45:44.791 --> 45:47.416
-Yeah!
-Nice swat! Way to get after it.

45:48.333 --> 45:49.291
Good D.

46:01.333 --> 46:03.625
Finna hit you with a hazy, cross sidestep.

46:03.708 --> 46:04.625
Think you can stop me?

46:11.541 --> 46:12.375
Yeah!

46:13.458 --> 46:15.583
Stan's kid getting a lesson here.

46:15.666 --> 46:18.458
You're good. Don't come over here.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.541
-Shit.
-He's like a giraffe on roller skates.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.750
Shake that off. Shake it off.

46:26.833 --> 46:28.333
You get it, right?

46:29.583 --> 46:32.000
Step back three.
Really can't guard me, bro.

46:40.458 --> 46:41.458
Damn, you slow.

46:43.583 --> 46:46.291
-Hey, let's take a seat for a minute.
-No.

46:46.875 --> 46:48.375
Just give yourself a breather.

46:48.458 --> 46:50.666
Listen to him.
Listen to your daddy.

46:53.958 --> 46:55.000
Here comes a brick.

46:56.166 --> 46:57.291
Oh, yeah!

46:57.375 --> 46:59.416
You can see it's getting to his head.

47:04.916 --> 47:07.833
-Oh! It's okay.
-I think the game's too fast for him.

47:11.083 --> 47:12.083
Nothing.

47:15.541 --> 47:16.583
Move out the way.

47:16.666 --> 47:17.958
All right, kid.

47:31.958 --> 47:33.458
Olé, bitch!

47:38.708 --> 47:39.958
Shit.

47:41.125 --> 47:42.541
He had his moments. I saw it.

47:42.625 --> 47:44.958
That wasn't him.
That wasn't even close to him.

47:45.458 --> 47:48.166
It's my fault.
I rushed this whole thing.

47:48.250 --> 47:51.000
Remember our freshman year,
we were playing at Gonzaga,

47:51.083 --> 47:52.750
they put John Stockton on me?

47:52.833 --> 47:55.416
You said watch out for this guy.
I said nobody looking like

47:55.500 --> 47:57.333
an insurance salesman
going to bust my ass.

47:57.416 --> 48:00.458
Midway through the second half,
20 points, 20 assists.

48:00.541 --> 48:03.291
-None of y'all would look at me. Remember?
-I remember.

48:03.375 --> 48:05.208
Remember me playing like that again?

48:05.291 --> 48:07.875
No, 'cause I never wanted
to feel that feeling again.

48:08.416 --> 48:10.041
So tonight's a good thing.

48:10.125 --> 48:12.166
Nothing was good about tonight.

48:12.250 --> 48:14.083
That was some awful…

48:14.166 --> 48:16.708
-Wanna grab some din-din?
-I got to catch a plane.

48:17.416 --> 48:21.041
You're gonna have to pick up the tab
on the Spanish kid. I'm not interested.

48:22.208 --> 48:24.208
Time to get back out there
and keep looking.

48:24.708 --> 48:27.375
You're gonna miss
another one of your daughter's birthdays.

48:27.458 --> 48:29.583
The Sixers will send
something nice for her.

48:33.166 --> 48:37.500
Hey, I never asked you
to pick up the tab on him, Vincent.

48:38.125 --> 48:39.666
Frankly, I'm not interested

48:39.750 --> 48:43.083
in working for a smug,
born-on-third fucking bitch.

48:43.833 --> 48:45.208
So how's this?

48:45.958 --> 48:50.041
Kiss my fat ass,
and fuck your five-star hotels.

48:50.125 --> 48:51.500
I quit.

48:59.500 --> 49:00.916
So Stanley's not coming to dinner?

49:01.000 --> 49:02.875
-I really wish he was now.

49:02.958 --> 49:05.208
Stanley knows
how to fuck up his life.

49:05.291 --> 49:07.083
Another bad decision in the books.

49:16.583 --> 49:18.208
The combine's in six weeks.

49:21.708 --> 49:22.958
Can you get my guy in?

49:24.916 --> 49:25.833
I'll work on it.

49:26.708 --> 49:28.916
Don't have a heart attack, man.
Come on, 22.

49:38.875 --> 49:39.916
I fly home tomorrow.

49:40.958 --> 49:42.375
Is that what you want to do?

49:43.916 --> 49:45.041
You come all this way,

49:45.125 --> 49:47.500
have one bad day,
and you're ready to back down?

49:48.125 --> 49:50.583
-No, but I suck.
-Do you love this game?

49:52.166 --> 49:53.833
Love it with your whole heart?

49:55.291 --> 49:58.500
Because if you don't,
let's not even bother.

50:00.125 --> 50:03.750
Let's not open that door.
They're gonna slam it right in our face.

50:03.833 --> 50:06.833
I love this game. I live this game.

50:08.583 --> 50:12.791
And there's 1,000 other guys waiting in
the wings who are obsessed with this game.

50:15.416 --> 50:17.708
Obsession is gonna beat talent every time.

50:18.666 --> 50:21.875
You've got all the talent in the world,
but are you obsessed?

50:22.500 --> 50:24.583
Is it all you ever think about?

50:24.666 --> 50:26.916
Let's face it,
it's you against you out there.

50:28.083 --> 50:33.125
When you walk on that court, you have
to think, "I am the best guy out there."

50:33.208 --> 50:34.958
"I don't care if LeBron's playing."

50:36.416 --> 50:39.625
So let me ask you again.
Do you love this game?

50:41.833 --> 50:42.666
Yes.

50:43.375 --> 50:45.666
Is there a newborn kitten
purring in here right now?

50:45.750 --> 50:46.791
I couldn't hear you.

50:48.041 --> 50:51.291
-Do you want to be in the NBA?
-Yes!

50:52.666 --> 50:53.875
Let's make that happen.

50:56.041 --> 50:57.375
Never back down.

51:11.375 --> 51:12.416
Hello.

51:12.500 --> 51:15.791
Buenos días, Bo Cruz.
I'm out front.

51:18.291 --> 51:20.041
Stanley, it's- 10, man.

51:20.125 --> 51:22.375
Come on downstairs.
Bring your shit.

51:25.458 --> 51:28.916
Kobe used to get up at- 00 a.m.
so he could practice before practice.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.333
I got you a gift.

51:34.833 --> 51:37.250
-Kobes.
-That's right, for inspiration.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.041
-Let's get to work.

51:40.125 --> 51:42.041
The combine's in a month and a half.

51:42.125 --> 51:45.208
It's a televised game, so the whole
world's gonna get to see you play.

51:45.291 --> 51:46.500
We got to get you ready.

51:48.458 --> 51:49.666
So you see this hill?

51:50.500 --> 51:53.875
Average professional biker can get
to the top of this hill in two minutes.

51:53.958 --> 51:58.125
We're gonna come out here every morning
till you get the top, running, minute-45.

51:58.916 --> 52:00.375
-Shit.
-Yeah.

52:00.958 --> 52:03.541
And three, two, one.

52:03.625 --> 52:05.958
-Let's go. Move it, kid. Yup.

52:06.041 --> 52:07.375
Looking good.

52:07.458 --> 52:10.833
That's it, man. That's it. I like it.

52:10.916 --> 52:11.916
Go, go, go!

52:12.833 --> 52:14.208
Pump it.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.166
Pump those arms.

52:20.708 --> 52:24.166
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Don't stop. To the top.

52:27.333 --> 52:31.166
Oh, we're going to be here
a lot, bud. Let's go!

52:35.458 --> 52:38.291
Keep going, come on. Find it in you.

52:39.125 --> 52:43.041
You got to push it, bro.
I'm telling you, I'm gonna hit your heels.

52:43.666 --> 52:46.416
Oh, my goodness gracious.

52:47.291 --> 52:50.875
-Okay. All right, so that's time.

52:50.958 --> 52:53.500
I had no idea
this stopwatch went that high.

52:54.916 --> 52:56.000
I'm not shitting you.

52:56.083 --> 53:00.041
When we were teaching my daughter to walk,
she got up this hill faster than you.

53:03.250 --> 53:04.458
Just get in the car.

53:05.250 --> 53:07.500
Whew. We've got a lot of work to do, baby.

53:08.750 --> 53:10.666
Ah, you're getting sweat in my Malibu.

53:10.750 --> 53:12.750
-Oh, all right.

53:17.833 --> 53:19.125
Bo.

53:19.208 --> 53:21.333
Hi. This is my daughter, Alex.

53:21.416 --> 53:23.083
-This is Bo.
-Nice to meet you.

53:23.958 --> 53:26.291
-Hi.
-She's going to be shooting us today.

53:26.375 --> 53:27.958
Are you ready, kid?

53:28.041 --> 53:29.708
-Alex.
-Yes.

53:29.791 --> 53:32.375
All right. All right.
I've never seen her like that.

53:32.458 --> 53:33.416
That was funny.

53:33.500 --> 53:34.916
All right.

53:35.583 --> 53:38.000
Get this.
Alex, get this round. Initiate contact.

53:38.083 --> 53:39.833
Don't get jammed. Get past that.

53:39.916 --> 53:42.750
Drive. Use your legs. Downhill.
Down. Finish--

53:42.833 --> 53:44.666
-Come on. All right.

53:44.750 --> 53:46.958
Your first year in the league, no calls.

53:47.041 --> 53:48.166
You need a hand up?

53:48.250 --> 53:50.208
Get out of here. Don't look so sad.

53:50.291 --> 53:53.250
Go ahead. Zoom in
on that sad face of his right now.

53:53.333 --> 53:55.250
I want you to finish through it. Let's go.

53:55.333 --> 53:57.458
All right,
shoulders down, that's right. Go!

53:58.625 --> 53:59.541
Okay. All right.

53:59.625 --> 54:02.958
You absorbed the contact. I need you
to finish through the contact.

54:03.041 --> 54:06.541
Alex, you get that?
Okay, we're getting there. Go, go, go!

54:06.625 --> 54:10.000
Cut. Move. Go downhill!
All the way, now finish it.

54:10.083 --> 54:12.708
Oh! That's how you take it to the rim.

54:12.791 --> 54:16.541
What happened? Were you on me?
Always on the money, sweetheart.

54:16.625 --> 54:17.541
Good God.

54:18.708 --> 54:20.708
-He is mad because he's hungry.

54:20.791 --> 54:23.416
What'd he say?
Because I'm what? He made a fat joke?

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
-He's special.
-Special, right?

54:34.166 --> 54:36.458
-What's that baby chick about?
-Um…

54:36.541 --> 54:38.458
That's for my daughter, Lucia.

54:38.541 --> 54:40.833
We call her Pollito.
It means little chicken.

54:40.916 --> 54:43.208
So all these are for my mom
and my daughter.

54:43.291 --> 54:44.666
They mean everything to me.

54:45.333 --> 54:47.875
-What about your dad?
-All these are for him.

54:52.541 --> 54:53.666
Don't think, react!

54:53.750 --> 54:56.291
-She did it.
-She's good with camera.

54:56.375 --> 54:59.291
She's good. She didn't have to put
her name on your… But that's fine.

54:59.375 --> 55:01.291
Okay. This ain't Europe, baby.

55:01.375 --> 55:04.166
It gets quick here. Offense takes skill.

55:04.250 --> 55:07.125
Defense takes balls, baby. That's right.

55:07.208 --> 55:09.000
Oh! Stop that shit!

55:09.083 --> 55:11.375
Game gets quick! Okay, here we go!

55:11.458 --> 55:12.583
Oh!

55:13.250 --> 55:16.041
-Took the charge!
-Come on! Hell fuckin' yeah!

55:16.541 --> 55:18.125
So, how do you think you did?

55:18.208 --> 55:21.458
They scored a couple times,
but I think I did pretty good.

55:21.541 --> 55:24.541
Three guys were running at you full tilt
for five minutes straight,

55:24.625 --> 55:26.125
and they scored a couple times.

55:26.208 --> 55:27.708
-You crushed it.

55:27.791 --> 55:30.791
The only thing in your way
is that big brain of yours.

55:30.875 --> 55:33.375
You're sensitive.
I get that. I'm sensitive too.

55:33.458 --> 55:36.541
I cried at the end of Titanic,
but I'm not in the NBA.

55:36.625 --> 55:39.083
You? You can never be soft again.

55:39.166 --> 55:40.750
-I'm not soft.
-Please.

55:40.833 --> 55:44.666
Kermit, a guy named after a frog,
said some mean words to you,

55:44.750 --> 55:47.125
and you wanted
to take your ball and run home.

55:47.208 --> 55:49.583
It was a trick.
It's never gonna happen again.

55:49.666 --> 55:51.458
-Nothing he said bothered you?
-No.

55:51.541 --> 55:53.666
-Kermit?
-Okay, my bad.

55:53.750 --> 55:55.458
I'm overthinking it, I guess.

55:55.541 --> 55:59.958
So, uh, take 20 threes. Every miss,
you're gonna run the bleachers.

56:05.083 --> 56:06.208
Oh, nice.

56:10.708 --> 56:11.583
Nice.

56:11.666 --> 56:13.541
-Your mom's a whore.
-What?

56:14.583 --> 56:16.500
-What?
-What was that?

56:16.583 --> 56:19.500
-Just said some words. That's it. Hey.
-It's not cool, man.

56:19.583 --> 56:22.166
What are you still
standing here for? Let's go.

56:22.250 --> 56:24.500
-You know what's not cool?

56:24.583 --> 56:27.333
A grown man letting another
grown man hurt his feelings.

56:27.416 --> 56:30.916
Players are gonna try to get in your head
every time you step on the court.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.958
You gotta be an iceberg out there,

56:33.041 --> 56:37.166
all floating around
and sharp and taking down ships.

56:37.250 --> 56:39.875
When I played college ball,
every time I took a shot,

56:39.958 --> 56:43.583
somebody tried to insult me.
They called me short or slow or chubby.

56:43.666 --> 56:45.750
-You know what I did?
-What'd you do?

56:45.833 --> 56:48.458
I started passing
'cause I couldn't shoot for shit.

56:48.541 --> 56:50.333
But you don't want my career.

56:50.416 --> 56:53.541
You wanna be Bo Cruz,
All-Star, Hall-of-Famer.

56:53.625 --> 56:54.958
So, let's do this.

56:55.041 --> 56:56.500
Your sweat smells like piss.

56:58.208 --> 56:59.583
Good. Good. Good.

57:00.333 --> 57:02.208
Son of a thousand sluts.

57:02.291 --> 57:04.458
Stanley been working on his Spanish.

57:04.541 --> 57:07.458
Yeah. Right. I looked it up
so I can insult you, my friend.

57:07.541 --> 57:10.041
Get fucked by a fish, dumbass.

57:10.125 --> 57:13.541
-I love it.
-Yeah. All right. Good.

57:13.625 --> 57:16.000
-Your mom's not a whore, by the way.
-Thank you.

57:16.083 --> 57:19.083
Yeah. Whores get paid.
She gives that fat ass out for free.

57:19.166 --> 57:20.958
-What?

57:21.041 --> 57:23.208
-Come on! We're building a callus!

57:23.291 --> 57:24.458
Get outta here!

57:24.541 --> 57:26.375
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

57:32.875 --> 57:34.125
Smells good.

57:37.583 --> 57:38.500
What's all this?

57:39.375 --> 57:43.708
Two hundred dollars' worth of Pringles?
These are meals for the week.

57:43.791 --> 57:46.333
Tell him to rinse the containers,
so I can reuse them.

57:46.416 --> 57:49.750
And also, tell him
pornography is free on the Internet.

57:49.833 --> 57:52.166
He's paying for porno?

57:52.750 --> 57:55.166
-And who is Paula Serrano?

57:56.208 --> 58:00.708
-You've been wiring her $500 a week.
-"Paola." Paola's Bo's mother.

58:00.791 --> 58:05.958
They live check-to-check, so I had to.
He's got a daughter to support.

58:06.041 --> 58:08.791
-You got a daughter to support.
-Right.

58:08.875 --> 58:11.708
Just tell him
to pump the brakes on the Pringles.

58:11.791 --> 58:14.541
At least until the Sixers
start picking up the tab.

58:15.041 --> 58:19.291
Yeah, so I wanna talk to you
about the tab.

58:20.250 --> 58:22.416
-It's gonna be fine. Don't worry.

58:22.500 --> 58:24.416
Worry? Why would I worry?

58:25.000 --> 58:28.208
You're just unemployed, spending money
on some man I've never--

58:28.291 --> 58:31.083
-He's an investment.
-We don't have money to invest.

58:31.166 --> 58:32.250
You told me to quit.

58:32.333 --> 58:34.625
And I meant it until you actually did it.

58:34.708 --> 58:36.750
-Now I'm freaked out.
-Well, I'm not.

58:36.833 --> 58:39.250
I know what I'm doing.
You'll see. I'll show you.

58:39.333 --> 58:41.083
Yeah, you do that.

58:48.208 --> 58:51.500
Hey! Hey! Hey!

58:51.583 --> 58:53.375
Rise and shine, Marine!

58:53.458 --> 58:55.416
Sorry. Sorry.

58:56.333 --> 58:57.250
Okay.

58:57.833 --> 58:59.291
Stanley, what you want, man?

58:59.958 --> 59:01.000
It's- 30.

59:01.083 --> 59:04.083
There's two weeks left to the combine.
We gotta get rolling.

59:04.166 --> 59:06.916
What happened here?
Was there something wrong with this?

59:07.708 --> 59:11.208
-I told you, just one bite.
-On a $40 steak?

59:11.291 --> 59:14.333
You're gonna throw $39 away. I don't know.

59:14.958 --> 59:16.750
Here. This is for you.

59:17.791 --> 59:20.041
-What's this?
-That's your meals for the week.

59:20.125 --> 59:23.333
My wife made them, so they're healthy.
You can eat the whole thing.

59:23.416 --> 59:26.625
I got a notice from accounting.
Scale back on the room service.

59:26.708 --> 59:29.750
-I'm sorry, Stanley. I didn't mean--
-No. It's all good.

59:29.833 --> 59:32.791
They also mentioned
they'd love you to stop with the porno.

59:32.875 --> 59:35.041
Porno? It wasn't me.

59:35.708 --> 59:36.625
Then who was it?

59:39.083 --> 59:41.000
Okay, it was me. Fuck.

59:41.083 --> 59:44.333
Get ready. Downstairs.
Five minutes. All right?

59:44.416 --> 59:47.000
We'll have fun,
but we're gonna kick your ass today.

59:47.083 --> 59:48.916
Try not to whack off while I'm gone.

59:53.625 --> 59:54.541
Okay.

59:55.750 --> 59:57.416
So, what happened to your hand?

59:57.500 --> 59:58.500
My hand?

59:59.375 --> 1:00:03.291
It was a freak thing. Car accident.
A long time ago. No more stalling.

1:00:03.375 --> 1:00:04.250
Run.

1:00:08.416 --> 1:00:10.500
-Always running.
-Go get 'em.

1:00:16.083 --> 1:00:16.916
Okay.

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.291
We'll work on you driving in
and escaping out.

1:00:19.375 --> 1:00:21.583
So as you take the cone in
and place it down,

1:00:21.666 --> 1:00:25.125
those fans are gonna blow it at you,
so you gotta escape trouble, quick.

1:00:25.208 --> 1:00:26.833
Yeah, I know it's tough.

1:00:28.458 --> 1:00:30.833
Knees up! Let's go!

1:00:31.666 --> 1:00:33.541
Okay. Bring out the big guy.

1:00:33.625 --> 1:00:36.708
You gotta work on your precision,
hit small targets out there.

1:00:36.791 --> 1:00:39.041
We gotta get right through this.
Don't think about it.

1:00:39.125 --> 1:00:40.208

1:04:41.333 --> 1:04:44.291
Guess who? Attack! Step back! And finish!

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.666
-Good.
-Always staying low.

1:04:46.750 --> 1:04:49.000
Stay low. Handle the pressure.
Let's go. Grab that.

1:04:49.083 --> 1:04:52.125
You can get more than that.
That's it. Stay strong.

1:04:52.208 --> 1:04:53.708
Good. Good. Good.

1:04:55.666 --> 1:04:58.541
-Hey! Be bold, man! Be bold!
-Yeah, baby.

1:04:58.625 --> 1:05:00.291
Go! Don't stop, baby! Go!

1:05:00.375 --> 1:05:02.500
Right through it! And, Bo!

1:05:03.250 --> 1:05:07.458
- 01! We're getting there, baby!
We're on the right track. Let's go!

1:05:08.791 --> 1:05:11.750
-Eight, nine.
-¡Mi roble! Let's go! ¡Mi roble!

1:05:11.833 --> 1:05:16.958
Damn. Smells like a truck full of shit
emptied itself into your mouth.

1:05:17.041 --> 1:05:21.375
Nothing affects this young man.
I like that. Hey. Nice.

1:05:21.458 --> 1:05:23.291
-I'm gonna catch those feet!

1:05:23.375 --> 1:05:25.666
Oh, look how scared he is!

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.208
No stopping.
Got nothing for you.

1:05:39.416 --> 1:05:40.916
That's what I'm talking about.

1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.708
Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

1:05:44.958 --> 1:05:47.458
You know how much I love that.
Hard work, baby.

1:05:47.541 --> 1:05:50.125
I knew when I saw you.
That's a hardworking fool.

1:05:50.208 --> 1:05:52.416
-You're going somewhere.
-We're going together.

1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:54.041
We're going together. Whoo!

1:05:54.125 --> 1:05:58.333
Okay, good. Look around. Who's open?
Be patient. Now! Attack! Go! Go! Go!

1:05:58.416 --> 1:06:01.791
Okay, retreat.
Yeah, that's good, man. That's it. Wait.

1:06:01.875 --> 1:06:05.541
You'll find times you go down there,
and nothing's open, wait, you'll find it.

1:06:05.625 --> 1:06:07.750
You're hot, baby! You're hot.

1:06:08.666 --> 1:06:10.958
Bo Cruz coming down!

1:06:11.041 --> 1:06:13.375
-Low, yeah--
-Gotta make passes under pressure.

1:06:13.458 --> 1:06:16.875
That's it! Okay, nice.
We're cooking. Last one.

1:06:16.958 --> 1:06:20.166
Push it!
Get into the next gear! Go! Go! Go!

1:06:20.250 --> 1:06:22.958
Jimmy Butler's up on you.
Now what? Now what?

1:06:23.041 --> 1:06:25.458
We're doing this
'cause nobody else is doing this.

1:06:25.541 --> 1:06:27.041
Come on! Whoo!

1:06:27.125 --> 1:06:29.083
That's it. Back. Pass.

1:06:29.166 --> 1:06:32.041
Let's go, Bo.
Finish that. Come on now, Bo!

1:06:32.125 --> 1:06:35.750
Good, Bo! Yeah, Bo!
Use that clock! Use that clock!

1:06:35.833 --> 1:06:38.291
Find a shooter! That's it! Hit that!

1:06:38.375 --> 1:06:39.291
Whoo!

1:06:39.375 --> 1:06:40.791
You're ahead, baby! Now!

1:06:41.541 --> 1:06:44.125
On your right! Kick his ass!

1:06:44.208 --> 1:06:46.041
Leave him in the dust! That's right!

1:06:46.125 --> 1:06:48.541
Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive!

1:06:50.625 --> 1:06:53.791
Yeah! Yeah, suck it, baby!

1:06:53.875 --> 1:06:56.833
Go! You're gonna get this!
You're gonna get this!

1:06:56.916 --> 1:07:01.500
That's it, brother! Yes, sir!

1:07:01.583 --> 1:07:05.666
Minute forty-four
with room to spare, baby! Yes!

1:07:05.750 --> 1:07:07.625
The Cruz Missile!

1:07:07.708 --> 1:07:09.416
You know you like that!

1:07:10.750 --> 1:07:11.958
Look at him go!

1:07:14.083 --> 1:07:15.791
That a baby!

1:07:15.875 --> 1:07:16.916
Stanley!

1:07:17.458 --> 1:07:18.666
We did it!

1:07:19.333 --> 1:07:21.250
Yeah! Rocky!

1:07:24.041 --> 1:07:25.625
-Yeah!
-Love it!

1:07:38.041 --> 1:07:40.125
For God's sake,
get the kid more butter.

1:07:40.208 --> 1:07:42.750
I mean, it's almost
the whole stick of butter.

1:07:42.833 --> 1:07:44.291
-Hey.

1:07:44.375 --> 1:07:47.208
What do you think
of the Cruz Missile as a nickname for--

1:07:47.291 --> 1:07:48.875
-The Cruz--
-He doesn't like it.

1:07:48.958 --> 1:07:50.250
That nickname is stupid.

1:07:50.333 --> 1:07:52.625
-He says it's stupid.

1:07:52.708 --> 1:07:54.041
Don't be rude.

1:07:54.625 --> 1:07:57.875
-So, do you have any pictures of Lucia?
-I miss her so much.

1:07:57.958 --> 1:08:00.166
Aw!

1:08:00.250 --> 1:08:02.166
She has your eyes.

1:08:02.250 --> 1:08:04.500
Yeah. She does. They're beautiful.

1:08:04.583 --> 1:08:05.750
Easy, tiger.

1:08:05.833 --> 1:08:07.500
-No.

1:08:07.583 --> 1:08:10.000
So, have you ever been
away from her this long?

1:08:10.666 --> 1:08:14.458
-I've never been away from her.
-Never? Oh, my goodness.

1:08:15.833 --> 1:08:19.333
So, anyway, Mrs. Sugerman,
tell me how you met this guy.

1:08:19.416 --> 1:08:23.666
-"How'd she become so lucky?" He's asking.
-Okay. All right. Story time.

1:08:23.750 --> 1:08:29.583
So, I was on the women's track team,
and we had a meet at Virginia Tech,

1:08:29.666 --> 1:08:34.625
and it was the same time
that the men's basketball team had a game.

1:08:34.708 --> 1:08:37.833
And, unfortunately for us,
our bus broke down. So…

1:08:37.916 --> 1:08:39.458
Mm-hmm. I paid the bus driver.

1:08:39.541 --> 1:08:44.041
We had to bum a ride home
with those fools.

1:08:44.125 --> 1:08:48.708
Stanley sat next to me
for three hours, the entire ride home,

1:08:48.791 --> 1:08:50.666
and he didn't say one word.

1:08:50.750 --> 1:08:53.708
I didn't think
she wanted to talk to me. I was scared.

1:08:53.791 --> 1:08:56.000
And then, as everybody is walking off,

1:08:56.083 --> 1:08:59.916
he just says crazy loud,
"One day, I'm gonna marry you,

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.375
and we're gonna have
very athletic children!"

1:09:02.458 --> 1:09:04.875
-I'm like, "What?"
-You really say that?

1:09:04.958 --> 1:09:08.625
I did. Yeah, it worked. Right?
Look, I do. We both have a…

1:09:08.708 --> 1:09:11.416
-Well, not athletic at all--
-Hey! What the heck?

1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:13.750
-Not even badminton. Not Frisbee.
-Okay.

1:09:13.833 --> 1:09:15.416
Playing checkers, she falls down.

1:09:15.500 --> 1:09:17.500
-I'm just saying.
-Oh, my God.

1:09:17.583 --> 1:09:20.833
-Oh, my God!
-That was when you played at Temple?

1:09:20.916 --> 1:09:23.291
I played at Temple. Yeah.
How'd you know that?

1:09:23.375 --> 1:09:25.625
Come on, Stanley.
You follow me to my home,

1:09:25.708 --> 1:09:27.291
offer me, like, crazy money,

1:09:27.375 --> 1:09:29.583
you don't think
I'll look you up on Internet?

1:09:29.666 --> 1:09:31.916
Number 22. Double Deuce.

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.333
Uh-huh!

1:09:33.416 --> 1:09:36.083
Somebody did his homework,
unlike somebody else.

1:09:36.166 --> 1:09:39.875
Well, Stan can ball.
You do know he can handle the rock.

1:09:39.958 --> 1:09:41.500
-Stanley?
-If he didn't get hurt,

1:09:41.583 --> 1:09:43.791
-it'd have been a different story.
-Who wants coffee?

1:09:43.875 --> 1:09:46.541
-You want coffee? I'll get coffee.
-Spanish coffee, please.

1:09:46.625 --> 1:09:50.166
Okay. I'm gonna go to Spain.
I'll be right back, guys.

1:10:00.916 --> 1:10:03.666
Yo. Leon.
Thanks for getting back so quickly.

1:10:03.750 --> 1:10:05.625
I'm sorry. The list is locked.

1:10:05.708 --> 1:10:08.791
What? I thought you said
you could get it done.

1:10:08.875 --> 1:10:12.291
You should've told me about all this shit
before I called all around the league,

1:10:12.375 --> 1:10:13.541
vouching for this guy.

1:10:13.625 --> 1:10:16.000
Shit. What? What shit you talking about?

1:10:16.083 --> 1:10:19.541
He's got an assault charge.
And Vince is all over TV talking about it.

1:10:19.625 --> 1:10:24.083
And joining us now,
the co-owner of the 76ers, Vince Merrick.

1:10:24.166 --> 1:10:27.208
-Vince, thanks for being here tonight.
-Thanks for having me.

1:10:27.291 --> 1:10:30.875
So, Vince, is it true
the Sixers brought in Bo Cruz,

1:10:30.958 --> 1:10:33.666
who has a history of assault,
to play in the combine?

1:10:33.750 --> 1:10:37.333
No. Bo Cruz has no affiliation
with the 76ers.

1:10:37.416 --> 1:10:41.208
He was brought over here by
a disgruntled employee, Stanley Sugerman.

1:10:41.291 --> 1:10:44.916
I specifically told Mr. Sugerman
not to bring him over.

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.791
He lied to the organization
and to this young man.

1:10:47.875 --> 1:10:50.916
Mr. Sugerman's selfish behavior
has been part of his track record.

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.208
He's been let go.
He's no longer part of the 76ers.

1:10:54.208 --> 1:10:57.625
Vince, we loved your father.
Thank you for bringing this story to us.

1:11:13.708 --> 1:11:16.708
Hey, Bo. Just get in the car, man.
Let me talk to you.

1:11:17.333 --> 1:11:20.416
What are you gonna do?
Walk to Spain? Just please, let me--

1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:22.375
-You fucking lied to me!
-I know.

1:11:22.458 --> 1:11:24.416
-You lied to me.
-All right. He's all right.

1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:27.583
I quit my job for you!
You said "trust," and I fucking trust you.

1:11:27.666 --> 1:11:29.291
-I'm sorry.
-You gambled with my life!

1:11:29.375 --> 1:11:32.000
-It wasn't a gamble. It was a sure thing.
-It's fucking over.

1:11:32.083 --> 1:11:34.458
You and me is fucking over!
You hear me? Over!

1:11:34.541 --> 1:11:37.375
-Hey. No. Just stop. Right now. Please.

1:11:37.458 --> 1:11:38.833
Don't throw it all away.

1:11:38.916 --> 1:11:42.375
I'm begging you, just let go of me.
Get in the car. It's not worth it.

1:11:42.458 --> 1:11:44.875
I'm not worth it. Just stop. Okay.

1:11:45.666 --> 1:11:47.000
All right. Get in the car.

1:11:47.083 --> 1:11:50.250
-Everything okay here?
-Hey, guys. Yeah. Everything's good.

1:12:08.125 --> 1:12:09.500
When Lucia was two…

1:12:13.250 --> 1:12:15.333
her mom, Maria, asked me for her.

1:12:16.583 --> 1:12:18.583
She didn't wanna share custody anymore.

1:12:24.208 --> 1:12:25.333
I asked her, "Why?"

1:12:26.833 --> 1:12:28.500
She told me it was her boyfriend.

1:12:30.708 --> 1:12:35.083
He told her they can get money
from the government if she got Lucia.

1:12:37.916 --> 1:12:38.750
So…

1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.291
I went to his home.

1:12:44.250 --> 1:12:45.958
I swear, I just wanna talk to him.

1:12:47.583 --> 1:12:49.000
I know I make a mistake.

1:12:50.750 --> 1:12:52.916
But I'm not how they say I am.

1:12:56.791 --> 1:12:57.666
I get it.

1:12:59.125 --> 1:13:00.791
You don't get shit, man.

1:13:02.833 --> 1:13:06.416
You live in your perfect world,
with your perfect family.

1:13:06.500 --> 1:13:07.333
Mm.

1:13:20.833 --> 1:13:24.791
One night, after a game at Villanova,
we went to a party.

1:13:25.750 --> 1:13:27.375
Me and Leon.

1:13:30.708 --> 1:13:32.250
And on the way home, I…

1:13:33.208 --> 1:13:35.125
I had a few drinks in me.

1:13:36.541 --> 1:13:38.833
I looked down at the radio.

1:13:39.916 --> 1:13:42.708
When I looked back up,
I saw a telephone pole.

1:13:45.208 --> 1:13:46.875
I shot my hand out

1:13:48.125 --> 1:13:50.750
to stop Leon
from flying through the windshield.

1:13:51.416 --> 1:13:55.083
He still got banged up a little bit,
but my hand was pulp.

1:13:58.208 --> 1:14:03.916
I cost Leon and all my teammates
a shot at the NCAA title that year.

1:14:07.875 --> 1:14:09.750
I got to think about that.

1:14:09.833 --> 1:14:12.291
I mean, really, really marinate in it

1:14:13.375 --> 1:14:15.166
for six months in jail.

1:14:20.291 --> 1:14:22.666
Everything I worked for.

1:14:26.041 --> 1:14:27.041
My whole life.

1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.458
Everything I wanted.

1:14:32.041 --> 1:14:33.083
Gone.

1:14:52.291 --> 1:14:54.416
Half the fucking list are favors!

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:57.083
I'm not asking for a favor.
This guy can play!

1:14:57.958 --> 1:14:59.833
Everybody keeps saying that. That--

1:14:59.916 --> 1:15:02.083
But you don't know the whole story.

1:15:02.166 --> 1:15:04.000
He's-- Meet the kid!

1:15:05.166 --> 1:15:09.083
Just set it up! I'll bring him anywhere!
Anywhere! He'll play anyone!

1:15:09.166 --> 1:15:11.166
Will you-- Yes. Ryan!

1:15:11.791 --> 1:15:13.541
Yes, I know. I know.

1:15:13.625 --> 1:15:16.208
And you almost
didn't let Damian Lillard play!

1:15:17.250 --> 1:15:19.916
Right! So, you do make mistakes!

1:15:20.500 --> 1:15:24.208
Don't make a mistake on this kid.
I'm begging you, pal. For…

1:15:24.291 --> 1:15:26.500
For your sake, not just mine!

1:15:26.583 --> 1:15:32.416
God damn it. I spoke
at your father's camp every year!

1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:35.791
And I never asked for anything back! Okay?

1:15:35.875 --> 1:15:39.166
So I'm asking you now for something!
Please help me!

1:15:43.500 --> 1:15:45.791
Jesus Christ!

1:15:49.583 --> 1:15:51.666
You know what? I have…

1:15:54.791 --> 1:15:59.208
been in this league
for 30 years, and it's like I'm nothing.

1:16:02.541 --> 1:16:04.083
It's like I wasn't even here.

1:16:04.666 --> 1:16:08.250
Stanley, it's not about the last play.

1:16:08.333 --> 1:16:10.000
It's about the next one, right?

1:16:10.083 --> 1:16:13.583
That's if you're in the game, T.
I wasn't even in the game.

1:16:17.791 --> 1:16:18.916
It's okay.

1:16:21.708 --> 1:16:22.708
It's okay.

1:16:26.250 --> 1:16:28.958
Hey. Wake up.

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:33.958
-You fell asleep in the chair.

1:16:34.041 --> 1:16:35.125
Yeah?

1:16:36.041 --> 1:16:36.958
Okay.

1:16:43.458 --> 1:16:46.750
-Hey, Dad, I was thinking--
-Just a second, let me finish this.

1:16:51.791 --> 1:16:54.250
Stan, you're gonna
give yourself a heart attack.

1:16:57.750 --> 1:17:02.208
-People just need to see him play, right?
-Certain people. Yeah.

1:17:02.291 --> 1:17:05.375
Well, remember that video you showed me
of your doctor friend?

1:17:05.458 --> 1:17:07.916
-My doctor friend?

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.208
We take the right one home
from the hospital?

1:17:10.291 --> 1:17:12.291
That's Dr. J.
He's not a real doctor.

1:17:12.375 --> 1:17:13.250
Oh. Well, whatever.

1:17:13.333 --> 1:17:15.958
That video has, like, two million views.

1:17:16.791 --> 1:17:19.208
-I was thinking--
-I can't ask him to do that.

1:17:20.208 --> 1:17:21.125
Well, I can.

1:17:21.208 --> 1:17:23.458
-No, no.
-No, I'm gonna ask him.

1:17:27.666 --> 1:17:30.291
Hey, sweetie. It's T.

1:17:37.708 --> 1:17:38.833
This is gonna be good.

1:17:39.333 --> 1:17:40.208
Hey, guys.

1:17:40.875 --> 1:17:42.875
I was hoping you could
help us out with something.

1:17:43.625 --> 1:17:46.375
-Yo, is that who I think it is?
-Yeah, that's Dr. J.

1:17:46.458 --> 1:17:48.333
Yo, Doc!
Say "what's up" for my story!

1:17:48.416 --> 1:17:52.666
Yo. That's my friend Bo Cruz over there.
They call him the Boa.

1:17:52.750 --> 1:17:54.750
You know why they call him that?

1:17:54.833 --> 1:17:57.416
Because he squeezes the life
out of his prey.

1:17:58.208 --> 1:17:59.666
So, guys, here's the deal.

1:17:59.750 --> 1:18:02.416
I got money here.
He's gonna go out on the court.

1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:04.916
Somebody gets a shot off him
and can hit the rim,

1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:06.208
I'll give you 50 bucks.

1:18:06.291 --> 1:18:09.958
If you put a bucket in against this guy,
we'll give you 100 bucks.

1:18:10.041 --> 1:18:12.666
If you beat him in a game
of one-on-one to five,

1:18:12.750 --> 1:18:14.791
we'll give you 1,000 bucks.
What do you say?

1:18:14.875 --> 1:18:16.208
-I got next.

1:18:16.291 --> 1:18:17.458
All right. Let's go.

1:19:02.041 --> 1:19:05.791

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:32.125
We got one, baby!

1:19:42.083 --> 1:19:45.333
Holy shit. Bo Cruz.
Where did this kid come from?

1:19:45.416 --> 1:19:48.958
Yo, Bo Cruz. I wish I had you
on my Rutgers team in the '70s.

1:19:49.041 --> 1:19:52.041
We talkin' about practice?
Man don't need no practice.

1:19:52.125 --> 1:19:54.791
A legend in the making.
You heard it from your man AI.

1:20:18.583 --> 1:20:21.041
If you not here, you not nowhere.

1:20:23.416 --> 1:20:28.041

1:20:47.958 --> 1:20:49.375
Oh!

1:20:57.166 --> 1:20:58.708


1:21:24.916 --> 1:21:28.083
…been taking on streetball
legends, NBA players. Doesn't care.

1:21:28.166 --> 1:21:29.916
Why aren't they inviting him
to the combine?

1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.791
That's why you have the combine
for players like this.

1:21:32.875 --> 1:21:35.000
Let the world see this talent.

1:21:35.083 --> 1:21:39.000
It's ridiculous what he's doing out there.
This ain't no gimmick, this real.

1:21:39.083 --> 1:21:41.583
The Boa needs to get to the combine.

1:21:41.666 --> 1:21:45.333
As much as it pains me to say this,
you two guys are right.

1:21:45.416 --> 1:21:47.500
This kid Bo Cruz is special.

1:21:47.583 --> 1:21:51.083
Bo Cruz.
How does it feel getting into the combine?

1:21:51.166 --> 1:21:53.125
The combine? I'm in the combine?

1:21:53.208 --> 1:21:54.875
You are as of 30 minutes ago.

1:21:54.958 --> 1:21:57.541
Have you thought about
what team you wanna play for?

1:21:57.625 --> 1:22:00.833
-It'd be an honor to play for any team.
-I tell you what.

1:22:00.916 --> 1:22:03.166
He could be playing
for the Sixers right now,

1:22:03.250 --> 1:22:07.041
but Vince Merrick didn't want him.
He specifically said that. You remember?

1:22:07.125 --> 1:22:09.333
Anthony, you remember that, right?

1:22:09.416 --> 1:22:11.333
-You were interviewing him.
-That's right.

1:22:11.416 --> 1:22:13.500
He's 22. You're messing with his life.

1:22:13.583 --> 1:22:15.375
-What kind of ballplayer--
-Hang on.

1:22:15.458 --> 1:22:18.541
Have some respect for your profession.
Get the whole story next time.

1:22:18.625 --> 1:22:21.333
What kind of ballplayer--
I'll answer that question.

1:22:21.416 --> 1:22:25.500
This guy is as if Scottie Pippen
and a wolf had a baby,

1:22:25.583 --> 1:22:27.625
and Lisa Leslie raised him.

1:22:27.708 --> 1:22:29.791
And Allen Iverson was the babysitter.

1:22:30.958 --> 1:22:33.708
It gets weird, that stuff.
But you handled it great.

1:22:35.416 --> 1:22:37.583
What else is bothering you? Tell me.

1:22:38.875 --> 1:22:41.000
Nothing. See you tomorrow.

1:22:41.708 --> 1:22:42.791
Yeah.

1:22:50.083 --> 1:22:52.583
So, he got into the combine,
and he's not excited?

1:22:52.666 --> 1:22:55.791
He's in his own head.
He's not telling me anything.

1:22:56.666 --> 1:22:59.041
-Well, maybe he's just sad.

1:23:00.125 --> 1:23:04.166
Eh. I think he's overwhelmed.
The pressure's getting to him.

1:23:04.250 --> 1:23:08.000
Mm-mm. I bet it's the kid. Lucia.

1:23:08.916 --> 1:23:10.916
I mean, he's never been away from her.

1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:12.291
Like ever.

1:23:42.666 --> 1:23:44.166
Okay, here we go.

1:23:49.375 --> 1:23:50.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:23:50.375 --> 1:23:53.208
Superstars don't carry
their own bags. I got this.

1:24:04.875 --> 1:24:07.708
I'll meet you in the lobby
in one hour, okay?

1:24:09.208 --> 1:24:10.916
This is very, very good.

1:24:14.875 --> 1:24:17.708
Ray Hancock can't stop
working his ass off.

1:24:17.791 --> 1:24:20.000
Come on. Come on. Come with me.

1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:21.958
Hey.

1:24:22.916 --> 1:24:24.458
When you train for a marathon,

1:24:24.541 --> 1:24:27.333
you don't run 20 miles
the day before the race.

1:24:27.416 --> 1:24:28.333
You do nothing.

1:24:28.958 --> 1:24:32.500
All we could do now
is get you hurt or wear you out.

1:24:32.583 --> 1:24:34.000
So we're gonna do this.

1:24:35.833 --> 1:24:37.541
-Lucia!
-Papi!

1:24:40.125 --> 1:24:41.125
¡Hola!

1:24:54.666 --> 1:24:56.791
Boa challenge is still trending.

1:24:56.875 --> 1:24:59.625
People are excited to see
what you're gonna do tomorrow.

1:24:59.708 --> 1:25:01.583
Look at this. Look at this.

1:25:01.666 --> 1:25:05.291
You think I know that many people?
This is all for you, pal.

1:25:05.375 --> 1:25:07.750
-That's for us.
-Okay, it's for us. Let's get 'em.

1:25:08.666 --> 1:25:12.750
Tomorrow, they're gonna be watching you.
Every move you make, the camera's on you.

1:25:12.833 --> 1:25:15.958
And it's not just about how you play.
It's the intangibles.

1:25:16.041 --> 1:25:19.416
More important than making a shot
is how you handle missing a shot.

1:25:19.500 --> 1:25:21.666
Shit's gonna go wrong. So what?

1:25:21.750 --> 1:25:24.208
You've dealt with adversity
your whole goddamn life.

1:25:24.291 --> 1:25:26.041
-Yeah.
-It's Bo's turn.

1:25:27.083 --> 1:25:28.458
You're nervous, huh?

1:25:29.250 --> 1:25:30.375
It's all right.

1:25:30.458 --> 1:25:33.416
Hey. Clyde Drexler used to get
so nervous before games

1:25:33.500 --> 1:25:34.750
that he'd actually faint.

1:25:34.833 --> 1:25:36.958
I'm not kidding you.
The guy did it so much

1:25:37.041 --> 1:25:39.916
his teammates followed him around
so they could catch him.

1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:41.500
It became kind of a ritual.

1:25:42.125 --> 1:25:44.625
It's good to be nervous.
It means you give a shit.

1:25:44.708 --> 1:25:45.833
-All right?
-All right.

1:25:46.583 --> 1:25:49.041
-Mama, you'll get him to sleep?
-Okay.

1:25:49.125 --> 1:25:51.625
Okay. Lucia, go easy on the Pringles.

1:25:51.708 --> 1:25:53.666
-All right. Adiós.

1:25:53.750 --> 1:25:55.333
-Adiós.
-Bo Cruz.

1:25:56.541 --> 1:25:59.625
You're gonna Cruz-ify them tomorrow. Huh?

1:25:59.708 --> 1:26:01.625
-It's still not funny. Get out.
-It's no good?

1:26:01.708 --> 1:26:03.333
-Good night, my man.
-Good night.

1:26:03.416 --> 1:26:04.333
Crush 'em.

1:26:08.333 --> 1:26:11.250
-So, this is their shot?
-It is a big deal to be here.

1:26:11.333 --> 1:26:13.375
What kind of advice
do you have for this guy?

1:26:13.458 --> 1:26:17.541
This guy? Yeah, I've seen him play.
He's got a lot of talent. He's got it all.

1:26:17.625 --> 1:26:20.958
He can do a bit of everything.
I don't think he needs any advice from me.

1:26:21.708 --> 1:26:24.208
Yeah, most guys
in your position would not be here.

1:26:24.291 --> 1:26:26.958
You're already a lottery pick.
So what's your goal?

1:26:27.041 --> 1:26:29.625
Just gonna tear it up
and dominate and let the world know.

1:26:29.708 --> 1:26:30.791
You like that, Khris?

1:26:30.875 --> 1:26:33.208
-Cocky bastard, ain't he?
-Yeah.

1:26:34.291 --> 1:26:36.125
You against you. All right?

1:26:36.791 --> 1:26:39.375
We've done this a hundred times.
It's just another workout.

1:26:42.291 --> 1:26:43.500
You're an iceberg.

1:26:43.583 --> 1:26:45.666
Focus. Kick some ass.

1:26:45.750 --> 1:26:47.458
-Te quiero, papá.

1:26:49.708 --> 1:26:51.000
That's good.

1:26:51.916 --> 1:26:53.625
-Madre.
-Te quiero, mama.

1:26:53.708 --> 1:26:56.458
Have fun out there.
Where do you wanna sit?

1:26:57.125 --> 1:26:59.541
-Double D! I see you!
-Yeah! Hey, Leon.

1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:04.833
Come on, guys.

1:27:39.458 --> 1:27:40.666
3.04.

1:27:43.458 --> 1:27:46.208
Hey, yo, Stan. He can fly.
Damn. He can fly, man.

1:27:46.291 --> 1:27:48.291
-Tell Coach.
-Yes, sir.

1:27:48.958 --> 1:27:50.041
Thanks, Khris.

1:28:09.291 --> 1:28:10.916
It's from football.

1:28:11.416 --> 1:28:13.666
Okay. Well, then, soccer is good.

1:28:15.291 --> 1:28:18.750
I hate soccer. I can't say that.
I really do hate that sport.

1:28:21.583 --> 1:28:23.000
He's quick, but can he shoot?

1:28:26.750 --> 1:28:27.833
He can shoot.

1:28:37.041 --> 1:28:38.041
Olé, bitch.

1:28:42.791 --> 1:28:43.833
Calm.

1:28:47.416 --> 1:28:49.791
Fran Fraschilla here
at the NBA draft combine.

1:28:49.875 --> 1:28:52.458
Bo Cruz and Kermit Wilts
crushed it yesterday,

1:28:52.541 --> 1:28:55.500
blowing the roof off
with the speed and agility drills.

1:28:55.583 --> 1:28:57.916
I cannot wait for this match-up.

1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.333
We've been watching Kermit
since his AAU days.

1:29:00.416 --> 1:29:02.375
We know he's gonna be an NBA star,

1:29:02.458 --> 1:29:05.125
but this kid, Bo Cruz,
he's come out of nowhere.

1:29:05.208 --> 1:29:07.875
I thought I knew
every international player on the planet,

1:29:07.958 --> 1:29:10.083
but this kid is a revelation.

1:29:10.958 --> 1:29:12.250
It'll be a good game.

1:29:12.333 --> 1:29:15.541
Of course he's nervous, but I told him
the whole Clyde Drexler

1:29:15.625 --> 1:29:18.541
fainting-before-every-game story,
and that calmed him down.

1:29:18.625 --> 1:29:22.208
Clyde-- That was me who fainted
before every meet, not Clyde Drexler.

1:29:22.291 --> 1:29:24.666
That was you? Sorry. Just…

1:29:24.750 --> 1:29:28.083
Either way, it worked.
He's… He's feeling good.

1:29:28.666 --> 1:29:30.791
My wife says hi. My wife says hello.

1:29:30.875 --> 1:29:33.583
-Oh, hi.
-Hello, hello. They're excited.

1:29:34.291 --> 1:29:36.833
Okay. I love you.
I'm gonna watch the game.

1:29:41.583 --> 1:29:42.916
Strong like bull, huh?

1:29:44.500 --> 1:29:46.208
My bad. It's the Boa now.

1:29:46.291 --> 1:29:47.541
Hashtag Boa.

1:29:48.666 --> 1:29:51.375
They call you that
'cause you swallow anything, right?

1:29:51.458 --> 1:29:53.250
Unhinge that jaw. Hey.

1:29:54.583 --> 1:29:57.333
Hey, you hear me? Hey.

1:30:02.833 --> 1:30:05.166
And we're off. Here we go.

1:30:12.125 --> 1:30:14.750
-That's it! That's it!

1:30:14.833 --> 1:30:16.000
Good start, Bo.

1:30:19.750 --> 1:30:21.208
On your left, Bo. On it.

1:30:27.625 --> 1:30:28.666
That's all right.

1:30:29.666 --> 1:30:32.125
Let's get out and go.
Get out and go. Run wide.

1:30:35.125 --> 1:30:36.500
I'm good. I'm good.

1:30:43.958 --> 1:30:45.291
That a baby!

1:30:59.541 --> 1:31:00.625
Oop.

1:31:00.708 --> 1:31:02.166
Go get it. Go get it.

1:31:05.208 --> 1:31:06.208
Ooh.

1:31:08.291 --> 1:31:09.583
Time out!

1:31:09.666 --> 1:31:12.125
These guys behind us
are drooling over him.

1:31:14.666 --> 1:31:15.750
Go, Papa.

1:31:27.416 --> 1:31:30.375
That your little girl over there?
What's her name?

1:31:31.750 --> 1:31:34.375
Easy, boy.
Acting like I asked her out or something.

1:31:34.458 --> 1:31:36.083
Just trying to get to know you.

1:31:36.875 --> 1:31:37.750
Oh, shit.

1:31:37.833 --> 1:31:39.083
Where's her mom at?

1:31:41.708 --> 1:31:44.666
Oh, okay. I see what's going on.
That's your mom.

1:31:44.750 --> 1:31:46.916
Is it legal to have a kid
with your mom in Spain?

1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:48.708
We don't roll like that out here.

1:31:49.416 --> 1:31:51.625
Hey, I know you hear me. Hey.

1:32:03.041 --> 1:32:05.208
Yo. Greg. Greg.

1:32:13.250 --> 1:32:16.291
-Communicate to each other.
-Give my kid a breather.

1:32:23.041 --> 1:32:24.750
He pushed me.

1:32:24.833 --> 1:32:26.458
Take him out. Give him a rest.

1:32:26.541 --> 1:32:29.125
-Stanley, we got it.
-You don't have it.

1:32:29.875 --> 1:32:31.500
Jesus Christ.

1:32:33.208 --> 1:32:34.875
Don't got it. All right.

1:32:45.041 --> 1:32:47.500
Where's her mama anyway?
How come she ain't here?

1:32:47.583 --> 1:32:49.750
She probably shackin' it up
with somebody else.

1:32:50.541 --> 1:32:52.166
Tell her to shack it up with me.

1:32:52.250 --> 1:32:55.125
I'd be a great stepdad.
Give her a real man to look up to.

1:32:55.208 --> 1:32:57.083
Huh? What you got?

1:33:00.958 --> 1:33:02.958
Keep coming. Keep coming.

1:33:03.708 --> 1:33:05.041
Good. Good. Good.

1:33:07.791 --> 1:33:09.416
Look. She likes me.

1:33:10.833 --> 1:33:12.875
-Hey! Bo! Bo!

1:33:26.375 --> 1:33:27.666
Bo!

1:33:32.500 --> 1:33:33.875
Get off me.

1:33:42.833 --> 1:33:46.208
I've been coming
to the NBA draft combines for a long time,

1:33:46.291 --> 1:33:50.041
and what you don't wanna do
is show the NBA scouts and GMs

1:33:50.125 --> 1:33:51.625
that you can't keep your cool.

1:33:51.708 --> 1:33:56.208
This is gonna hurt him.
This is a problem. Kermit's really…

1:33:56.291 --> 1:34:00.875
They got him labeled now.
"Violent kid from a violent neighborhood."

1:34:01.541 --> 1:34:02.750
You know how it works.

1:34:03.708 --> 1:34:04.916
Ron Artest?

1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:07.875
He beat up the entire city of Detroit,
and everybody loves him.

1:34:07.958 --> 1:34:10.291
Just give it some time.
That's all it takes.

1:34:10.375 --> 1:34:12.583
You know,
everybody loves a redemption story.

1:34:13.333 --> 1:34:16.375
Some people don't get one.
Just keep falling.

1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:20.791
Shit, he was playing too. God damn it.

1:34:20.875 --> 1:34:21.875
Hmm.

1:34:55.208 --> 1:34:57.041
You played marvelously.

1:34:58.125 --> 1:34:59.250
Mama, don't.

1:35:00.541 --> 1:35:01.541
Look at me.

1:35:03.125 --> 1:35:05.666
Don't you see how incredible you are?

1:35:07.750 --> 1:35:09.208
You carry this weight.

1:35:10.208 --> 1:35:12.875
All that you do for Lucia, for me,

1:35:14.125 --> 1:35:15.458
it's never enough.

1:35:16.625 --> 1:35:17.708
All this love…

1:35:20.125 --> 1:35:21.750
and no love for yourself.

1:35:24.875 --> 1:35:26.500
When I first saw you here…

1:35:28.666 --> 1:35:30.375
the day we arrived,

1:35:30.458 --> 1:35:31.750
you looked…

1:35:33.666 --> 1:35:35.125
different.

1:35:35.208 --> 1:35:36.375
You looked lighter,

1:35:37.583 --> 1:35:39.833
like the weight was lifted.

1:35:41.333 --> 1:35:44.375
And I think that Stanley does for you

1:35:45.166 --> 1:35:46.833
what you do for us.

1:35:47.833 --> 1:35:50.458
He put all the weight on him

1:35:51.500 --> 1:35:52.958
so you can be you.

1:35:53.875 --> 1:35:55.708
He is your oak tree.

1:35:57.166 --> 1:36:00.083
You can say goodbye
to pro basketball here,

1:36:01.375 --> 1:36:05.250
but you don't need to say goodbye
to what this man has given you.

1:36:19.125 --> 1:36:22.375
Sorry I couldn't get you guys
all on the same flight.

1:36:22.458 --> 1:36:23.458
It's fine.

1:36:26.125 --> 1:36:29.500
So, if Sixers weren't paying,
who was paying?

1:36:31.625 --> 1:36:33.666
Me and-- Me and T.

1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:38.708
I ate so much minibar.

1:36:39.625 --> 1:36:41.666
On top of the porn addiction, yes.

1:36:44.833 --> 1:36:47.166
I… I'm gonna pay you back.

1:36:47.250 --> 1:36:48.250
What? No.

1:36:48.875 --> 1:36:49.750
Coaching you.

1:36:50.708 --> 1:36:52.625
That was the best month of my life.

1:37:07.333 --> 1:37:08.625
You can return it.

1:37:10.916 --> 1:37:11.791
Thank you.

1:37:14.250 --> 1:37:15.875
Okay. All right.

1:37:16.583 --> 1:37:17.875
Mr. Cruz Missile.

1:37:21.541 --> 1:37:23.291
Now you like the Cruz Missile?

1:37:23.375 --> 1:37:24.250
Nah.

1:37:24.750 --> 1:37:26.541
-Still stupid.

1:37:29.625 --> 1:37:31.708
Get out of here. Don't miss your flight.

1:37:48.375 --> 1:37:50.416
Couldn't give me just one, huh?

1:38:12.791 --> 1:38:15.166
-Big L, what's up?
-I got a game for you.

1:38:15.250 --> 1:38:17.500
Open run. Last-minute, very hush-hush.

1:38:17.583 --> 1:38:20.000
No press. Just players and front office.

1:38:20.083 --> 1:38:21.291
Lot of front office.

1:38:21.375 --> 1:38:23.000
No, no, no. We-- We can't.

1:38:23.083 --> 1:38:24.125
Oh, yes, you can.

1:38:24.208 --> 1:38:27.041
'Cause I had to grind
to put your damn names on the list.

1:38:27.125 --> 1:38:28.833
-There's a list?
-What's up, Leon?

1:38:28.916 --> 1:38:30.666
Of course there's a list. Look.

1:38:30.750 --> 1:38:34.166
Cardinal Hayes High School,
650 Grand Concourse, the Bronx.

1:38:34.250 --> 1:38:37.708
-They start at- 00. Don't be late.
-We're… I'm at the airport, man.

1:38:37.791 --> 1:38:39.958
Bo's not even with me. It's too late.

1:38:40.041 --> 1:38:42.166
-Is the plane in the air?
-No.

1:38:42.250 --> 1:38:44.791
Then what the fuck
are you still talking to me for?

1:38:47.541 --> 1:38:48.666
Sorry.

1:38:49.875 --> 1:38:51.375
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:38:52.500 --> 1:38:55.666
Okay. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1:39:24.791 --> 1:39:26.750
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1:39:26.833 --> 1:39:29.375
Yo, yo, yo, yo. Did it start yet?

1:39:29.458 --> 1:39:31.750
-What's your--
-They're good. They're with me.

1:39:31.833 --> 1:39:33.666
-Okay.
-Y'all are good.

1:39:33.750 --> 1:39:35.958
-I still need that. Your phone.
-The phone?

1:39:36.041 --> 1:39:37.625
Relax. Gonna take my phone too?

1:39:37.708 --> 1:39:40.833
No, well, I don't trust the big one.
He's beating people up.

1:39:45.916 --> 1:39:46.958
-Yo.
-Stan.

1:39:47.041 --> 1:39:48.458
-Hey, Mark.
-Good to see you.

1:39:48.541 --> 1:39:50.666
How are you? Right on. Aaron.

1:39:50.750 --> 1:39:53.125
Good to see you. Staying in shape, I see.

1:39:53.791 --> 1:39:54.625
My man Bo.

1:40:04.666 --> 1:40:07.208
-All right. Show us what you got, fella.
-Yes, sir.

1:40:08.541 --> 1:40:09.375
Look who's here.

1:40:10.250 --> 1:40:12.875
You know what? He just said
the same thing about you.

1:40:12.958 --> 1:40:15.666
And I'm gonna say
one last inspirational thing to you.

1:40:16.250 --> 1:40:18.541
They can't kill you
if you're already dead.

1:40:31.791 --> 1:40:32.666
Hey.

1:40:37.333 --> 1:40:38.708
Trae. Trae. Trae.

1:40:42.333 --> 1:40:43.250
God damn.

1:40:43.333 --> 1:40:44.333
Good pass!

1:40:45.541 --> 1:40:48.208
All right. Let's go, baby. Come on!

1:40:48.958 --> 1:40:50.583
-All right, big fella.
-I got it.

1:40:50.666 --> 1:40:53.083
-You got it? You sure?
-I got this.

1:40:53.166 --> 1:40:56.708
-Well, come on.
-That dude is waving off Trae Young.

1:40:56.791 --> 1:40:58.250
-How old is he?
-I don't know.

1:40:58.333 --> 1:41:00.708
-But the Mavericks think he's 18.

1:41:04.416 --> 1:41:05.833
I saw. I saw.

1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:18.166
Move it around.

1:41:19.083 --> 1:41:19.916
Right here.

1:41:20.416 --> 1:41:21.708
That's it!

1:41:21.791 --> 1:41:22.916
You're trash.

1:41:31.666 --> 1:41:33.375
-That's a beautiful shot.
-That's nice.

1:41:33.458 --> 1:41:35.208
-That's your boy, Stan?
-Yeah, yeah.

1:41:35.291 --> 1:41:36.666
Yeah, Mark. Yeah.

1:41:40.625 --> 1:41:42.041
What you got? Let's go.

1:41:42.125 --> 1:41:44.250
Do what you do. Do what you do.

1:41:46.958 --> 1:41:48.041
Stay with him.

1:41:57.875 --> 1:41:58.875
Oh, yeah.

1:42:01.125 --> 1:42:02.583
Bo. Come get it.

1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:04.958
What you want?

1:42:14.791 --> 1:42:17.791
Oh, yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!

1:42:17.875 --> 1:42:20.333
-Stanley lookin' like a proud daddy.
-That's right.

1:42:20.416 --> 1:42:21.916
Give me the fucking ball, man.

1:42:26.625 --> 1:42:27.791
Ooh!

1:42:32.875 --> 1:42:34.750
-Who is that guy?
-I don't even know.

1:42:43.416 --> 1:42:44.541
Yeah.

1:42:46.166 --> 1:42:48.583
Looks like a guy that could
impact winning at our level.

1:42:48.666 --> 1:42:51.500
-Take it to him.
-We need to get him up to Boston.

1:42:51.583 --> 1:42:52.875
-Absolutely.
-Hey.

1:42:53.625 --> 1:42:56.083
-We'll talk soon.
-Okay, Brad. Nice seeing you.

1:42:56.833 --> 1:43:00.708
-"If Scottie and a wolf had a baby--"
-You saw that?

1:43:00.791 --> 1:43:02.458
The whole city saw it.

1:43:02.541 --> 1:43:06.125
Well, luckily, Philadelphia sports fans
are calm, reasonable people.

1:43:06.208 --> 1:43:07.250
Bo, get this.

1:43:07.833 --> 1:43:09.958
So, what are you doing here?

1:43:10.041 --> 1:43:11.791
I'm taking a more active role.

1:43:15.875 --> 1:43:18.583
Vin is gonna share the throne with you?

1:43:18.666 --> 1:43:19.666
No.

1:43:20.166 --> 1:43:24.041
He made a big mess,
and I could use some help cleaning it up.

1:43:26.166 --> 1:43:27.708
-I like that.

1:43:34.583 --> 1:43:36.291
That's it. Go. Go, go, go.

1:43:37.083 --> 1:43:38.500
Finish it.

1:44:06.750 --> 1:44:09.625
Hey, Bubba.
How's the film school final coming along?

1:44:09.708 --> 1:44:12.625
It's good. We wrapped early,
so I can catch the game.

1:44:12.708 --> 1:44:14.916
You're voluntarily
watching a basketball game.

1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:16.583
-Well, now we gotta win.

1:44:16.666 --> 1:44:18.083
-Let's do it.

1:44:18.166 --> 1:44:21.166
-Yes. Coming, Coach. Gotta split.
-Good luck. I love you.

1:44:21.250 --> 1:44:22.333
I love you too.

1:44:23.916 --> 1:44:25.166
Nice suit, Stan.

1:44:25.250 --> 1:44:27.291
Just trying to look like you, Doc.

1:44:27.375 --> 1:44:30.458
-You think that's working?
-Uh, not even close. Don't worry.

1:44:30.541 --> 1:44:32.375
-All right, gentlemen.

1:44:33.458 --> 1:44:34.416

Hey, Coach!

1:45:30.833 --> 1:45:33.250
Twenty-two? I see you.

1:45:33.333 --> 1:45:36.166
After we kick your ass,
you should try to coach soccer.

1:45:36.250 --> 1:45:37.416
-Soccer?
-Yeah.

1:45:37.500 --> 1:45:40.041
I'll move to Spain
and shack up with your mother.

1:45:42.666 --> 1:45:44.166
That doesn't work anymore.

1:45:44.250 --> 1:45:45.791
Aw. I thought I had you there.

1:45:45.875 --> 1:45:49.625
Okay. Good to see you, son.
You be aggressive tonight.

1:45:49.708 --> 1:45:53.125
Play hard, all right?
Don't tell these guys I'm pulling for you.

1:46:00.833 --> 1:46:04.041
Doesn't miss. Doesn't miss.

1:46:04.125 --> 1:46:07.333
Hey, guys. Let's bring it in.
First play is V4.

1:46:07.416 --> 1:46:09.041
Stepping up to set this pick.

1:46:09.125 --> 1:46:11.666
Tyrese, if you can
turn a corner, shoot it.

1:46:11.750 --> 1:46:14.791
If not, get it to Tobias.
He'll be wide open. All right?

1:46:14.875 --> 1:46:16.875
-Let's get it in.
-Come on, let's go.

1:46:16.958 --> 1:46:19.333
-"Together," on three. One, two, three.
-Together!

1:46:20.250 --> 1:46:23.375
Twenty-two, he goes to his right,
he wants to get to the rim.

1:46:23.458 --> 1:46:25.416
Left, he wants to get to his step back.

1:46:25.500 --> 1:46:27.958
I got you, Coach. I'm ready for round two.

1:46:28.041 --> 1:46:29.208
Be aware.

1:46:37.375 --> 1:46:40.041
Give a warm welcome

1:46:40.125 --> 1:46:44.916
to your Philadelphia 76ers!

1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:48.291
Hernangómez drives speed,
Reed with the step.

1:46:48.375 --> 1:46:49.708
That's high percentage.

The steal artist Matisse Thybulle.

And a little extra-curricular activity
after the miss.

-
-Getting a little heated there.

1:47:19.625 --> 1:47:20.916
Getting fired up.

1:47:26.375 --> 1:47:30.125
Anthony Edwards,
that time he does finish.

1:47:30.208 --> 1:47:34.208
Smith looking for the three.
He's been on fire. It hits!

1:47:34.291 --> 1:47:37.250
He's tied the game. Kenny Smith…

1:47:37.333 --> 1:47:40.583
I think of the Doctor.
Yes, he's got it. Here he comes.

1:47:40.666 --> 1:47:42.666
Wait. The Doctor made a sensational play.

1:47:42.750 --> 1:47:44.958
Nowitzki goes right at Bowen

1:47:45.583 --> 1:47:48.666
and the foul! So Nowitzki to the line.

1:47:48.750 --> 1:47:49.583
Marjanovic.

1:47:49.666 --> 1:47:52.250
That was pretty
Harlem Globetrotter-esque.

1:47:52.333 --> 1:47:53.625
That was pretty funny.

1:47:53.708 --> 1:47:57.166
Iverson! He is the man!

1:47:57.250 --> 1:48:00.291
Listen to this crowd as AI rejoices.

1:48:01.500 --> 1:48:03.791
-Shaquille O'Neal.
-The Shaq Attack!

1:48:03.875 --> 1:48:07.458
-Hold on to the roof.
-I have never seen that.

1:48:07.541 --> 1:48:08.791
Barkley!

1:48:09.291 --> 1:48:12.208
He has 37, two under his playoff…

1:48:12.291 --> 1:48:15.125
It's gonna take some Luka magic
to save the possession.

1:48:15.208 --> 1:48:16.541
And he put it in!

1:48:18.958 --> 1:48:20.833
Wagner! Wow!

1:48:20.916 --> 1:48:24.166
Oh, me, oh my,
Mark Jackson right down the throat.

1:48:24.250 --> 1:48:27.416
Kyle turns the corner,
drives, got it.

1:48:27.500 --> 1:48:29.291
-Kyle Lowry--
-He got 'em!

1:48:29.375 --> 1:48:32.125
Trae drives it all the way
and lays it in.

1:48:32.208 --> 1:48:33.708
Bingo! Trae Young.

1:48:34.583 --> 1:48:37.458
That was amazing!
Aaron Gordon, you win!

1:48:37.541 --> 1:48:39.583
Jordan Clarkson, my goodness.

1:48:39.666 --> 1:48:40.791
Broken ankle. Wow.

1:48:40.875 --> 1:48:42.625
Tough shot. Count it, for Clarkson.

1:48:44.166 --> 1:48:45.666
Driving all the way!

1:48:45.750 --> 1:48:49.416
-Khris Middleton in the face.
-Oh, my goodness. Oh, man.

1:48:50.666 --> 1:48:52.458
Calderón!

1:48:52.541 --> 1:48:55.916

-Demps to the basket.
-Dell Demps with a dunk.

1:49:31.500 --> 1:49:34.916
With another three-point basket,
his third of the game.

1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:36.083
The owner loved it.
