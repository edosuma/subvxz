The senior prom...

02:24.769 --> 02:27.564
Can you believe
it's almost over

02:27.647 --> 02:29.190
{\an1}and we're almost out
of here?

02:29.274 --> 02:31.025
Why do you sound so sad?

02:31.109 --> 02:32.527
Well, when I started here
in ninth grade

02:32.610 --> 02:34.946
I never even thought I'd make it
through high school.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.739
Now I guess I'm going
to miss it.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.533
Not me.
I can't wait till it's over.

02:38.616 --> 02:39.534
Come on, Bren.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.703
There must be someone
you can ask to prom.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.746
Who? Another reject
who doesn't have a date?

02:43.830 --> 02:44.747
No, thanks.

02:44.831 --> 02:45.582
Bren, you have to go.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.458
I mean, the entertainment
committee

02:47.542 --> 02:49.252
actually got Cathy Dennis
to play at our prom.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.629
You can't miss it.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.424
{\an1}Look, don't tell me
you're going

02:54.507 --> 02:55.300
{\an1}to be playing poker
with Tony Miller

02:55.383 --> 02:57.385
instead of coming to prom.

02:57.468 --> 02:58.511
{\an3}I don't have
a date, Steve.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.096
{\an1}Well, then get
a date, man!

03:00.179 --> 03:01.264
It's your one-and-
only senior prom.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.765
I don't know.
I'm with Tony.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.309
It's really not
that big a deal.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.935
It's gonna be a great time.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.312
We're gonna have a blast.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.396
{\an3}You'll just have
to have fun for me.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.982
Okay, you're forcing me
to get sentimental here.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.026
{\an1}The gang
should be together.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.111
Birth to Earth, womb to tomb.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.154
I'm touched, Steve.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.488
Really, I am.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.574
But you're just gonna have
to get by without me.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.700
I told you, I don't have a date.

03:20.783 --> 03:25.914
I don't know why you just don't
break down and ask her.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.165
Who?

03:27.248 --> 03:28.583
Who?

03:28.666 --> 03:30.960
{\an3}Brandon, you don't have
to be in love with someone

03:31.044 --> 03:32.629
to ask them to the prom.

03:32.712 --> 03:33.880
{\an3}Andrea is part
of the gang.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.506
She should be there
and so should you.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.258
Just go ask her.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.929
{\an3}Brandon, go in there
and ask her.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.973
Just cut the copy on the
earthquake safety story.

03:44.057 --> 03:44.933
That's my copy.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.309
{\an3}Tobi, we're not talking
Pulitzer Prize here.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.479
Howard, you wouldn't know
a Pulitzer Prize

03:49.562 --> 03:50.480
from a prize pullet.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.148
{\an1}Would you guys
just relax?

03:52.231 --> 03:53.316
How do you expect
to put a paper out every week

03:53.399 --> 03:55.693
if you're gonna argue
about every single layout?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.987
{\an3}You know,

03:58.071 --> 03:59.489
they kind of remind me of you
and Brandon.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.325
Not me.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.035
Brandon, maybe, but, uh...

04:04.118 --> 04:06.037
"Brandon maybe" what?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.997
{\an1}Uh, Brandon
may be covering

04:08.081 --> 04:09.165
the school board
meeting tonight.

04:09.248 --> 04:10.333
Forget it.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.502
Come on, Brandon.
It's the last one.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.670
{\an1}Do it for
old times' sake.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.171
I'll tell you what, you do it

04:15.254 --> 04:16.673
for old times' sake
and I'll stay home

04:16.755 --> 04:18.675
and feel guilty-- or better
yet, why don't you give it

04:18.757 --> 04:20.843
{\an3}to one of the juniors here,
you know, pass the torch.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.512
{\an1}No can do-- I'm covering
track-and-field finals

04:22.595 --> 04:24.138
{\an1}at Marshall
this afternoon.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.224
{\an1}And I've got an interview
Go on, Brandon.b.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.184
{\an1}It's the last chance
you can at least pretend

04:28.267 --> 04:30.019
{\an1}you care about the fate
of this school.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.104
Oh, I care.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.063
{\an1}ANDREA:
Great.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.064
It's settled.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.482
Here's the agenda. 7:30.

04:34.565 --> 04:35.483
Don't be late.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.569
Get out of here.

04:41.614 --> 04:42.657
{\an3}Hey, guys.

04:42.740 --> 04:43.533
Hi, David.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.868
{\an3}Listen, Bren,
my dad's throwing

04:45.952 --> 04:47.453
a pre-prom party at his condo.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.871
It's sort of his tribute

04:48.955 --> 04:49.539
to the mighty
class of '93.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.708
That's nice.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.418
{\an3}He gets real excited
about this stuff.

04:53.501 --> 04:54.669
I guess he feels
like he's reliving

04:54.752 --> 04:55.670
his senior year or something.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.630
I'm not going to prom, David.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.551
Oh.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.677
Well, you can still come.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.053
This is before prom.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.221
I don't think so.

05:05.304 --> 05:06.389
Do me a favor.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.932
{\an3}Wake me when this
whole week is over.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.350
I don't understand.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.395
{\an3}There's like 50
guys who would die

05:12.478 --> 05:14.564
{\an3}to go to prom with
Brenda Walsh.

05:14.647 --> 05:15.565
Well, where are they?

05:15.648 --> 05:16.899
I mean, I feel so bad.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.985
{\an1}Prom won't be the same
without Bren.

05:19.068 --> 05:22.905
{\an3}Well,<i> we</i> are going
to have a good time.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.908
{\an3}I'm calling the BelAge today
and reserving us a room.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.702
You are?

05:27.785 --> 05:28.745
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

05:28.828 --> 05:32.749
{\an3}A room with a view,
a wet bar, fresh flowers,

05:32.832 --> 05:34.625
complimentary
fruit basket,

05:34.709 --> 05:37.712
{\an6}and of course,
most important,
a king-size bed.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.882
{\an1}Oh, David,
I'm really nervous.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.550
Oh, but don't be.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.426
{\an3}You said prom night
was our night.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.636
It's a night
to remember.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.597
{\an1}I know, but I,
I just need time

05:47.680 --> 05:49.474
{\an1}to think about it, okay?
Don't push me.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.100
Oh, I'm not pushing.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.268
It's just that, uh,

05:52.351 --> 05:55.605
well, you know, a hotel room
on prom night at the BelAge

05:55.688 --> 05:56.481
is kinda hard to come by.

05:56.564 --> 06:00.610
Well, I'll let
you know, okay?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.487
I promise.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.953
Mm!

06:11.037 --> 06:12.288
So, does your mom know

06:12.371 --> 06:14.207
that you come over here
every day before school?

06:14.290 --> 06:15.208
No.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.168
No. What time is it?

06:17.251 --> 06:18.127
Who cares?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.630
{\an1}We only have two weeks
left of school.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.631
{\an1}What are they going to do,
kick us out?

06:21.714 --> 06:24.133
{\an3}You know, I don't know
what tastes better,

06:24.217 --> 06:25.134
the strawberries or you.

06:25.218 --> 06:25.676
Hmm.

06:28.221 --> 06:28.721
Me.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.307
Ah.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.684
Why don't we just skip school
altogether

06:33.768 --> 06:35.478
and stay in bed all day?

06:35.561 --> 06:36.521
I can't.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.981
{\an3}I got to go
to AP English

06:39.065 --> 06:42.944
or Meyers'll have my head.

06:43.027 --> 06:45.655
{\an3}I've been thinking
about prom night, though.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.490
What'd you have in mind?

06:47.573 --> 06:49.659
{\an3}Well, we gotta get out
of there early.

06:49.742 --> 06:50.910
That kinda goes
without saying.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.287
{\an1}Hey, we could get a room
right down the hall

06:53.371 --> 06:54.497
from all the other seniors.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.707
Come on, Kel, you gotta give me
some credit for originality.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.335
Now, if I get a room anywhere,

06:59.418 --> 07:01.712
it's gonna be on the top
of Nob Hill, the Fairmont Hotel.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.132
In San Francisco?

07:04.215 --> 07:05.675
I got to go to Berkeley
for the weekend

07:05.758 --> 07:06.717
to see a professor friend
of Meyers.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.636
So, I thought we'd just make
a weekend of it.

07:08.719 --> 07:09.637
That'll be so cool.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.139
We can go sailing in the Bay.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.473
We can ride the cable cars.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.683
We can eat in Chinatown.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.309
{\an3}Yeah, we could have
breakfast in bed.

07:15.393 --> 07:19.730
{\an3}Hell, we could have lunch
in bed, dinner in bed.

07:24.443 --> 07:24.902
What do you say?

07:24.986 --> 07:28.948
{\an1}(laughing):
Yes, yes.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.367
{\an1}But I have
to ask my mom first.

07:31.450 --> 07:32.702
Well, make her say yes.

07:32.785 --> 07:33.661
I will.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.913
Ditto, I will.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.216
What's that?

07:47.300 --> 07:50.094
{\an1}It's my yearbook
<i>The Oculous.</i>

07:50.178 --> 07:51.721
{\an3}Strolling down memory
lane are we?

07:51.804 --> 07:55.892
Yes, and if you make fun of me,
I'll get yours out, too.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.727
Look at me in high school.

07:57.810 --> 08:01.898
You know, I think I'd like
to be young again,

08:01.981 --> 08:03.107
but when I look at this...

08:03.191 --> 08:07.653
Honey, I definitely like you
better the way you are now.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.073
So, show me that geek
that took you to the prom.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.992
Harry Olsen was not a geek.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.076
Oh, come on.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.370
I met him at your reunion.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.580
The guy with
the terminal overbite.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.581
Jim!

08:18.664 --> 08:20.374
{\an1}Now my date,
on the other hand...

08:20.458 --> 08:21.584
Oh, please.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.753
{\an3}Ah, yes, the lovely
and talented Lynne...

08:23.836 --> 08:25.880
{\an1}Balliette.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.131
Balliette, that's it.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.424
Oh, here we go again.

08:28.507 --> 08:29.926
Do I have to hear
this story again?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.553
Yeah, your dear old dad,
swell a guy that he was,

08:32.636 --> 08:34.013
{\an3}wouldn't let you use
the new car,

08:34.096 --> 08:36.097
{\an3}so poor Lynn caught
her dress on a spring

08:36.182 --> 08:40.102
that came up thru the seat of
your Mom's old station wagon.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.438
Ah, yes, but there's

08:43.522 --> 08:45.107
one part of the story
I left out.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.275
What's that?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.902
The guy I doubled with
that night decided

08:47.985 --> 08:49.111
that he would try marijuana

08:49.195 --> 08:50.905
for the first time.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.823
We spent most of the prom
in the bathroom trying

08:52.907 --> 08:53.741
to convince him
that he was not being chased

08:53.824 --> 08:54.742
by giant purple bubbles.

08:54.825 --> 08:58.120
(laughs)

08:58.204 --> 09:01.582
So, Dad, did you inhale?

09:01.666 --> 09:05.127
Never mind.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.587
You know, Brandon,

09:06.671 --> 09:09.131
why don't you just go
to the prom by yourself, honey?

09:09.215 --> 09:10.341
You don't need a date.

09:10.424 --> 09:11.676
In fact, since

09:11.759 --> 09:13.678
Brenda doesn't have a date
either...

09:13.761 --> 09:15.304
Hey, stop it right there.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.306
{\an3}I am not taking
my sister to the prom.

09:17.390 --> 09:17.765
{\an3}Besides, you two
can relax.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.976
I'm going.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.560
That's great. Who with?

09:21.644 --> 09:23.312
I'm gonna ask Andrea...

09:23.396 --> 09:24.146
Hmm.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.107
{\an3}Which I guess
is somewhat like going

09:26.190 --> 09:27.191
with my sister anyway.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.328
What are you doing here?

09:39.412 --> 09:40.913
{\an1}Didn't think
I was gonna show up?

09:40.997 --> 09:41.872
No.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.457
{\an1}Well, thanks for the vote
of confidence.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.500
Can I go now?

09:44.583 --> 09:46.210
No. Sit.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.879
You know, Brandon,

09:48.963 --> 09:51.382
{\an3}some day you're gonna
miss all this.

09:51.465 --> 09:52.008
You realize this
is the last time

09:52.091 --> 09:53.843
that you and
I are going

09:53.926 --> 09:55.511
{\an3}to cover the school
board together.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.471
Well, I hate to burst
your bubble, Andrea,

09:57.555 --> 09:58.514
but this isn't exactly

09:58.597 --> 10:00.349
{\an1}what my golden memories
are gonna be made of.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.017
{\an4}MAN:
This meeting
will come to order.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.061
For the record, board member

10:04.145 --> 10:04.895
Melanie Silverman's
on vacation.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.856
The first item
on the table tonight

10:06.939 --> 10:09.692
is a motion to instate
wardrobe guidelines

10:09.775 --> 10:11.944
at district high schools.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.029
{\an1}Did he say
"wardrobe guidelines"?

10:13.112 --> 10:14.155
The full motion
is being passed out now,

10:14.238 --> 10:15.865
so you can review the specifics,
but in the meantime,

10:15.948 --> 10:20.661
I'd like to state why I think
this is extremely important.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.580
Our schools
should not be a forum

10:22.663 --> 10:24.206
for a fashion show
or a party.

10:24.290 --> 10:24.957
Our young women...

10:25.041 --> 10:26.751
{\an3}This wasn't even
on the agenda.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.752
I don't get it.

10:27.835 --> 10:28.919
{\an3}What are they trying
to pull here?

10:29.003 --> 10:31.213
{\an1}Who cares?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.632
Just be glad we're finally
getting out of this place.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.426
None of us is in favor
of banning jeans.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.511
Furthermore, though
we thankfully don't have

10:37.595 --> 10:38.679
a gang problem,
we're responding...

10:38.763 --> 10:40.431
They didn't put this
on the agenda

10:40.514 --> 10:41.223
because they didn't want
any dissent.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.392
Brandon, we've got
to do something.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.060
No, we don't.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.228
It's not our problem anymore.

10:46.312 --> 10:50.399
And finally, for both sexes,
there's the issue of T-shirts.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.442
I was walking down the hall

10:51.525 --> 10:52.985
in West Beverly last week.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.738
I actually saw a young man
wearing a loud yellow T-shirt

10:55.821 --> 10:57.948
with a picture on the front
of it

10:58.032 --> 11:01.035
of a Rastafarian smoking
a marijuana cigarette.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.703
Now, frankly,
this is not what

11:02.787 --> 11:05.373
I want to see advertised
in our schools.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.249
We need to address this problem

11:07.333 --> 11:09.377
and I think these
wardrobe guidelines

11:09.460 --> 11:10.961
may very well be
the most effective means we have

11:11.045 --> 11:13.964
to restoring an appropriate
academic environment.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.175
Comments from the floor?

11:20.137 --> 11:21.055
Yes, uh, good evening.

11:21.138 --> 11:21.931
I'm Felice Martin.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.767
{\an1}My daughter Donna
is a graduating senior

11:24.850 --> 11:25.976
at West Beverly.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.772
I agree with
Superintendent Ephardt.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.399
{\an3}Discipline is one
of our

11:31.482 --> 11:32.733
primary problems.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.610
{\an1}We have
to prepare our kids

11:34.693 --> 11:37.822
for the real world
where anything doesn't go.

11:37.905 --> 11:43.244
That's just what I think these
wardrobe guidelines achieve.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.579
Thank you, Mrs. Martin.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.626
{\an1}What's with these
"wardrobe guidelines"?

11:50.709 --> 11:51.961
{\an3}I guess it's the
politically correct way

11:52.044 --> 11:53.003
to say "dress code."

11:53.087 --> 11:54.964
Any further comments
before we vote?

11:55.047 --> 11:58.467
{\an3}Uh, excuse me,
uh, Doctor Ephardt.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.718
Yes, Miss Zuckerman?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.473
Um, is there a reason

12:04.557 --> 12:07.268
that this item was not on
the published agenda?

12:07.351 --> 12:08.644
It wasn't?

12:08.727 --> 12:09.562
{\an3}No, sir,

12:09.645 --> 12:11.647
it was not,
and that could be construed

12:11.730 --> 12:13.649
as you're trying to keep this
subject under wraps

12:13.732 --> 12:15.985
so none of the students
could be here to respond.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.487
I'm sure it was simply
an oversight.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.489
I thank you for pointing
it out to us

12:20.573 --> 12:22.825
and I'll have a talk
with the recording secretary.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.994
Uh, excuse me, for the record,

12:25.077 --> 12:27.663
Doctor Ephardt,
I would like it to be noted

12:27.746 --> 12:29.248
that this graduating senior

12:29.331 --> 12:31.625
thinks that "wardrobe
guidelines" or dress codes,

12:31.709 --> 12:33.627
or whatever you would
like to call them,

12:33.711 --> 12:35.796
are oppressive
and a terrible idea.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.798
Duly noted.
Any further comments?

12:39.550 --> 12:43.012
In that case, all in favor of
instituting wardrobe guidelines

12:43.095 --> 12:45.723
as noted in the written proposal
before you.

12:45.806 --> 12:49.351
{\an1}Four, one absent.
Motion passes.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.895
I'd likeNice try, chief. you....

12:50.978 --> 12:52.646
on what I think
is a courageous choice.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.647
I don't believe it.

12:53.731 --> 12:57.193
Next item, senior prom.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.612
It's been moved and seconded
in closed session

12:59.695 --> 13:01.071
that all seniors at district
high schools be notified

13:01.155 --> 13:06.702
that anyone found with liquor
or illicit drugs or intoxicated

13:06.785 --> 13:09.413
at any school-sponsored function
including prom night,

13:09.497 --> 13:11.832
be suspended with all senior
privileges revoked,

13:11.916 --> 13:16.587
including graduation, pending
further hearing by the board.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.172
Was this on the agenda?

13:18.255 --> 13:20.716
Another convenient oversight,
I'm sure.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.343
What's going on here?

13:22.426 --> 13:23.177
You don't need to worry.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.846
It's not our
problem anymore, right?

13:30.768 --> 13:32.186
{\an3}Well, I say if
you're dumb enough

13:32.269 --> 13:33.229
to let someone find out

13:33.312 --> 13:34.563
{\an3}you've been drinking
on prom night,

13:34.647 --> 13:35.856
{\an3}then you deserve
to be caught.

13:35.940 --> 13:36.982
You would.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.400
{\an3}Well, how bogus
is that?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.027
{\an3}Come on, the next
thing you know

13:40.110 --> 13:42.363
{\an3}they're gonna outlaw
sex on prom night.

13:42.446 --> 13:43.572
{\an1}They can't do that,
can they?

13:43.656 --> 13:44.573
{\an1}STEVE:
No, David.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.576
{\an3}They cannot pass
a law banning sex.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.870
Good.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.706
{\an1}What about this
dress code thing?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.416
Wardrobe guidelines.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.584
{\an3}Oh.
Well, whatever.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.253
I'm just glad I'm not
coming back next year.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.295
Sounds like West Beverly
is going to be a prison.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.423
I bet my dear mom was up
there like head warden.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.716
She's been trying to get

14:02.800 --> 14:03.717
{\an3}something like this
passed for years.

14:03.801 --> 14:04.677
{\an3}Yeah, Donna, what's
with your mother?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.136
{\an3}What does she have,
a wild bug in her ear?

14:06.220 --> 14:08.597
{\an3}No, it is more
than a bug.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.640
{\an3}She wants to run
for mayor.

14:09.723 --> 14:10.558
God help us all.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.143
Hey, this is my mom
we're talking about.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.062
And to know her
is to love her.

14:15.145 --> 14:19.108
(indistinct conversation)

14:20.484 --> 14:21.735
Did you ask Andrea yet?

14:21.819 --> 14:23.112
No.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.613
What are you waiting for?

14:24.697 --> 14:27.616
All right. Okay.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.076
I'll ask her.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.996
Go, boy.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.122
Hey, Andrea,

14:33.205 --> 14:35.583
can I, uh, can I talk
to you for a second?

14:35.666 --> 14:37.751
Sure, what's up?

14:37.835 --> 14:41.338
Well, I'd, uh...

14:41.422 --> 14:43.632
{\an1}I'd like to take you
to the prom.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.467
Brandon, that's sweet.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.595
{\an1}'Cause, you know,
Steve is right.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.346
{\an1}We've all gotta do
this thing together.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.557
{\an1}And we've been friends
too long to sit this out.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.558
Brandon, I'm going.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.436
{\an1}Of course you are, you're
coming with me, right?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.521
No, you don't understand.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.691
I, um, I already have a date.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.151
You do?

15:02.234 --> 15:04.945
Hey, Andrea.

15:06.864 --> 15:07.823
Jordan Bonner.

15:07.906 --> 15:10.659
I should've known.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.494
Sorry.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.621
No sweat.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.963
{\an1}Hi, honey.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.340
{\an1}I picked your dress up
at the tailor.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.550
He wanted me to tell you

15:26.634 --> 15:30.262
{\an1}he hasn't seen a waist this
small since Vivian Leigh.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.514
I heard what happened at
the school board today.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.600
{\an3}I have to tell you,
I'm a little surprised

15:34.683 --> 15:36.977
{\an3}you didn't try to institute
a dress code at prom.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.897
You know I feel very
strongly about this.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.148
{\an3}Yeah, well, don't you
think you're being

15:41.231 --> 15:43.275
a little extreme, Mom?

15:43.359 --> 15:44.485
{\an1}Hardly.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.528
{\an1}If I could get 'em
to wear uniforms, I would.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.530
Oh, I give up.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.366
Well, then we're even.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.117
Because I gave up on you

15:52.201 --> 15:53.994
a long time ago.

15:54.078 --> 15:57.039
Yeah.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.208
Well, between studying
for finals and the prom,

15:59.291 --> 16:02.211
I am so exhausted.

16:02.294 --> 16:06.340
{\an1}Honey, I hope you know how
proud Daddy and I are of you.

16:06.423 --> 16:10.135
I can't wait to see you
in your cap and gown.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.179
Me, too.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.222
Night-night, sweetheart.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.140
Night.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.101
{\an3}Oh, Mom,
I almost forgot.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.353
Uh, I'm gonna be
spending the night

16:19.436 --> 16:20.312
at Kelly's house
on prom night, okay?

16:22.147 --> 16:25.192
Donna, do you think
I was born yesterday?

16:25.275 --> 16:26.568
What do you mean?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.654
I know you're just trying
to avoid curfew.

16:28.737 --> 16:29.947
I think I used

16:30.030 --> 16:31.573
that same line
with my mother.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.908
Mom...

16:32.991 --> 16:35.119
{\an1}Honey, you don't have
to make up stories.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.121
This is prom night.

16:37.204 --> 16:40.082
I want you to go out

16:40.165 --> 16:42.251
and have a wonderful time.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.294
{\an1}You can stay out
as late as you want.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.087
You mean that?

16:45.170 --> 16:47.589
Of course I do.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.258
I trust you.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.300
Thanks.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.554
Good night, sweetheart.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.230
{\an3}Yo, Miller,

17:03.313 --> 17:05.398
{\an3}so when's
the poker game?

17:05.482 --> 17:07.984
Oh, I've been meaning to talk
to you about that, Walsh.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.611
There might not be one.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.487
{\an3}Why not?

17:10.570 --> 17:12.781
Well, I heard through
the grapevine

17:12.865 --> 17:14.950
that one of the most gorgeous
girls in this school

17:15.032 --> 17:15.784
{\an1}doesn't have a date
for prom.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.119
And I think
I'm goiMiller,sk her.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.789
{\an3}I thought you said you didn't
want to go to the prom.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.124
Well, I... I do
with this girl.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.291
Your sister.

17:30.340 --> 17:33.927
Brenda, I hear you're
not going to the prom.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.137
Say it isn't so.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.346
Oh, who cares?

17:36.430 --> 17:37.306
I don't know why everybody

17:37.389 --> 17:38.348
{\an1}makes such a big deal
out of it anyway.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.809
Well, me, either.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.145
So how 'bout going with me?

17:44.521 --> 17:45.439
What?

17:45.522 --> 17:46.648
Look, I'll go all out.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.652
Tux, limo, corsage,
the whole nine yards.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.487
I don't know.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.947
Let's just go and
have a good time.

17:54.031 --> 17:54.323
I love to dance.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.700
Yeah?

17:56.784 --> 17:57.576
Me, too.

17:58.410 --> 18:02.331
{\an3}All right, I'll go
with you, Tony.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.415
You will?

18:09.087 --> 18:11.215
Well, I thought it over.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.841
And...?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.343
And...

18:14.426 --> 18:18.555
{\an3}I want you to get the best
hotel room you can get.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.431
Mm.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.729
She's awesome.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.356
So I'm gonna see
your professor friend

18:27.439 --> 18:29.525
at Berkeley this weekend.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.068
That's great.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.362
{\an1}I was hoping you'd get
a chance to see the campus.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.363
{\an3}You really think
I got a shot, man?

18:34.446 --> 18:36.365
{\an3}I mean, my grades
are lousy.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.991
You never know.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.201
{\an1}Look, talk to Jamison.
See what he thinks.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.370
{\an1}I think your writing's
incredible.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.872
{\an1}And, well, Berkeley
could do a lot worse.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.166
Thanks, man.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.628
Okay, listen up, people.

18:50.462 --> 18:55.551
Since I am one of the chaperones
at prom this year...

18:55.634 --> 18:56.552
(applause)

18:56.635 --> 18:58.720
{\an3}Thank you.
Thank you.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.681
But not so fast.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.391
Not all of you are gonna
like what I have to say.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.269
{\an3}I've been ordered
by the school board

19:05.352 --> 19:06.770
{\an3}to read the following
announcement

19:06.854 --> 19:08.897
in all my senior classes.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.233
"Anyone who is found
with alcohol or illicit drugs

19:11.316 --> 19:13.569
"in their possession at prom,

19:13.652 --> 19:15.404
or who is determined
to be intoxicated

19:15.487 --> 19:17.573
"will face suspension

19:17.656 --> 19:19.741
"and, pending a hearing
before the school board,

19:19.825 --> 19:21.577
"will not be permitted
to participate

19:21.660 --> 19:24.371
in any senior functions,
including graduation."

19:24.454 --> 19:27.583
{\an3}So, what are they gonna have
a breathalyzer at every table?

19:27.666 --> 19:30.586
Hey, dude,
don't kill the messenger.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.129
I'm only reading this thing.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.088
Uh, Dylan's right.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.756
Who's gonna be responsible
for enforcement?

19:34.840 --> 19:35.924
I don't know.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.050
But since I am

19:37.134 --> 19:39.928
one of the designated
chaperones at this shindig,

19:40.012 --> 19:42.055
do me a favor, you guys,

19:42.139 --> 19:44.850
don't any of you decide
to become a test case.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.278
I cannot believe I bought
my dress the day of prom.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.280
{\an3}We got lucky,
didn't we?

19:58.363 --> 19:59.948
So how did it go?

20:00.032 --> 20:00.908
Check this out, Dad.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.160
The last dress in
the last store we went to.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.078
{\an1}Ooh, Brenda,
it's beautiful.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.455
{\an3}You couldn't have done better
if you had weeks to shop.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.290
What tiUh, 5:15.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.168
Oh, my God,
I'll never be ready.

20:11.251 --> 20:14.296
{\an3}Brenda, tell me
about Tony Miller.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.130
Not much to tell, Dad.

20:15.213 --> 20:18.133
He's a jock.
He's a guy. He asked.

20:18.216 --> 20:19.676
{\an1}Well, I'm just
glad you're going.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.094
{\an1}Yeah, well,
it won't exactly

20:21.178 --> 20:22.387
be like the spring dance
with Dylan.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.139
I mean, that was special.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.141
{\an1}Well, you'll have other
evenings like that, honey.

20:26.224 --> 20:28.185
I hope so.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.146
You know, it could be cool

20:31.230 --> 20:32.606
{\an3}in San Francisco
this time of year,

20:32.689 --> 20:33.357
{\an3}I want you
to take a jacket.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.359
{\an1}God, you sound like
such a mom.

20:35.442 --> 20:38.320
{\an1}Yes.?

20:38.403 --> 20:39.363
{\an1}But you're the best mom
in the whole world.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.782
Thank you for
letting me go.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.825
{\an3}Well, you are
18 years old now.

20:43.909 --> 20:47.037
{\an3}And you're graduating
from high school.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.207
{\an3}But promise me
you'll be careful.

20:50.290 --> 20:50.874
I always am.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.501
{\an3}And have
a wonderful time.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.461
{\an3}Tonight, and
the whole weekend.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.341
Thank you.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.593
Don't worry.

21:03.595 --> 21:07.349
I was so nervous it wouldn't fit
I didn't even eat all day.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.351
Well, you're gonna have
to have David feed you

21:09.434 --> 21:11.853
or you're gonna pass out
before the first dance.

21:11.937 --> 21:12.521
I'll be fine, Mom.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.857
So, how do I look?

21:15.941 --> 21:19.319
Like the princess that you are.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.364
God, I'm so excited.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.869
Here.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.246
{\an3}When you were little,
you always

21:29.329 --> 21:31.331
wanted to wear this.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.541
I think now's the time.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.583
It'll be beautiful.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.047
Thanks, Mom.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.216
But I don't think so.

21:41.299 --> 21:42.009
I don't really think it goes.

21:42.092 --> 21:45.345
Oh, honey, sure
it does, here.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.028
Oh, that is perfect.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.406
Thanks, Mom.

22:06.491 --> 22:24.509
Oh, you are so beautiful.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.552
{\an5}MEL:
<i>So what time did you say</i>
<i>everybody's getting here?</i>

22:25.635 --> 22:28.055
Well, any minute now.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.097
I said 7:30.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.557
Well, before they do,

22:30.640 --> 22:34.311
I would like to propose a toast.

22:34.394 --> 22:37.272
If I can get this thing off.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.398
There we go.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.112
{\an3}Thank you.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.823
And you...

22:47.741 --> 22:50.702
{\an3}To my only son,
David,

22:50.786 --> 22:53.038
and to you, Donna...

22:53.121 --> 22:55.582
May tonight be
the beginning

22:55.665 --> 22:58.460
of many celebrations for
the rest of your lives.

22:58.543 --> 23:02.172
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

23:06.551 --> 23:08.345
(whistling)

23:08.428 --> 23:11.139
So, Nat, is it always this empty
on prom night or what?

23:11.223 --> 23:11.807
It'll pick up later.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.142
The revelers will roll in.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.478
{\an1}God, it's even more depressing
than I thought it would be.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.729
Ah, cheer up, pal.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.315
For whatever it's worth,

23:20.398 --> 23:22.484
{\an1}I didn't go to
my senior prom either.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.319
You didn't?

23:24.402 --> 23:26.279
Nope.

23:26.363 --> 23:30.617
{\an1}I was supposed to take
Gina Delmonico.

23:30.700 --> 23:31.660
(swoons)

23:31.743 --> 23:38.125
{\an1}The most gorgeous girl
at Fairfax High.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.502
But she got the flu.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.880
So I ended up behind the
counter, just like you.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.299
Well, at least
you had a date.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.927
(telephone rings)

23:51.596 --> 23:53.682
{\an3}Peach Pit.

23:53.765 --> 23:56.309
{\an3}Oh, yeah,
honey, hang on.

23:56.393 --> 23:56.685
Brando, it's for you.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.687
It's Andrea.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.063
Andrea?

24:02.440 --> 24:04.025
{\an1}Hey, hey...
Hey, hey, hey.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.236
Hi. What's up?

24:06.319 --> 24:07.362
Hey, Brandon.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.739
I, uh, I just want to tell you
how flattered I was

24:09.823 --> 24:12.701
that you invited me to the prom.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.536
Even though Jordan asked me
and I wanted to go with him,

24:14.619 --> 24:17.706
I... I couldn't think of anyone

24:17.789 --> 24:19.875
I would've rather
have gone with than you.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.544
Andrea, did you call me up here
just to tell me that?

24:22.627 --> 24:24.546
No.

24:24.629 --> 24:25.714
Hey, are you okay?

24:25.797 --> 24:28.383
Jordan just called.

24:28.466 --> 24:30.218
He's in bed with the flu.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.678
I'm sitting here

24:31.761 --> 24:33.555
all dressed up
with no place to go.

24:33.638 --> 24:34.681
Don't you move.

24:34.764 --> 24:35.724
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.226
Nat, old buddy, old pal of mine,

24:38.310 --> 24:39.728
{\an3}I hate to do this to you
but I am out of here.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.730
{\an3}I'm going to
my senior prom.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.398
What happened?

24:43.481 --> 24:44.733
{\an3}Andrea's date just
pulled a Gina Delmonico.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.194
(laughs)

24:50.822 --> 24:53.700
{\an3}Dave, your father put
out the good stuff?

24:53.783 --> 24:57.412
Yeah, I think it was left
over from my Bar Mitzvah.

24:57.495 --> 25:00.040
{\an3}I guess he's not running
for the, uh, school board.

25:00.123 --> 25:01.750
{\an3}Think I can
have a glass?

25:01.833 --> 25:03.084
Yeah, I guess so.

25:03.168 --> 25:03.627
You're not driving,
are you?

25:03.710 --> 25:07.130
No, we have a limo.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.548
Well, then, bottoms up.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.926
And on that note,

25:11.009 --> 25:13.428
{\an3}if anybody needs me,
I'll be back in the bedroom

25:13.511 --> 25:14.804
trying to remember my own prom.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.316
Are you Kelly?

25:26.399 --> 25:27.359
Yeah.

25:27.442 --> 25:28.318
I'm Celeste.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.070
Steve's told me
a lot about you.

25:30.153 --> 25:32.280
Oh, that could be dangerous.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.074
Only good things.

25:34.157 --> 25:36.326
In fact, if I didn't
know better,

25:36.409 --> 25:38.286
{\an3}I'd wonder if he was
still crazy about you.

25:38.370 --> 25:38.954
Well, that was a long time ago.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.289
But Steve is a great guy.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.457
Don't believe a word

25:42.540 --> 25:44.292
she says about me.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.462
Here's to the two most beautiful
women I've ever known.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.631
I can't believe I'm
actually doing this.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.800
So much for school rules.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.468
{\an1}Come on, Kel,
it's your prom night.

25:53.551 --> 25:54.469
{\an1}It's never gonna
happen again,

25:54.552 --> 25:55.762
so bottoms up.

26:00.892 --> 26:01.768
Hey, guys!

26:01.851 --> 26:04.938
Hey, where's
the party?!

26:05.021 --> 26:06.147
Hi.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.524
What's up, Steve?

26:07.607 --> 26:08.566
Hi, Celeste.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.318
Bran, what are you doing here?

26:10.402 --> 26:11.486
{\an3}BRENDA:
Well, my brother

26:11.569 --> 26:12.654
always lands on his feet.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.781
{\an1}He even managed to hitch
a ride in our limo.

26:14.864 --> 26:16.658
{\an3}That's enough
Well, Jordan gabout Jordan.

26:16.741 --> 26:17.909
{\an3}This is our night
ladies and gentlemen.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.369
{\an3}We are all now present
and accounted for.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.496
So, David, you got any
more of that champagne?

26:21.579 --> 26:22.372
{\an1}Yeah man, there
should be

26:22.455 --> 26:24.624
a little bit left,
go help yourself.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.047
{\an3}You know, I didn't
want to say anything

26:31.131 --> 26:33.341
{\an3}in front of your parents
or your brother,

26:33.425 --> 26:36.011
but uh, that's a hot dress.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.430
Get your mind
out of the gutter, Miller.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.057
What did I say?

26:41.141 --> 26:41.808
Nothing.

26:41.891 --> 26:44.269
Come on, let's eat. I'm starved.

26:46.187 --> 26:47.564
You want some champagne?

26:47.647 --> 26:50.358
Sure, what the hell.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.405
Whoop... just enough
left for one glass.

26:55.488 --> 26:56.698
You drink it.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.033
{\an3}I don't like champagne
that much.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.159
Neither do I.

27:01.119 --> 27:04.622
{\an1}On second thought, maybe
I do like champagne.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.709
{\an1}Nope, nope, right
the first time,

27:07.792 --> 27:09.044
certainly don't
like champagne.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.086
I do. I love champagne.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.296
Good, here.

27:11.379 --> 27:14.341
Listen, I don't want
to kick anybody out,

27:14.424 --> 27:15.717
{\an1}but we should probably
get rolling.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.344
{\an1}And not a moment
too soon.

27:17.427 --> 27:19.763
Let us be on our way then.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.892
ByThank you, Mel.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.602
Bye, Mel.

27:25.685 --> 27:26.853
Hold it, hold it
guys, come on back.

27:26.936 --> 27:28.897
Come on. Just one.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.525
Oh, wait, I want
to get in the picture.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.486
Okay, you ready?

27:34.569 --> 27:39.532
Hey, let's hear it for
the class of '93, guys!

27:39.616 --> 27:40.450
Great.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.285
Bye,Bye....

27:42.369 --> 27:44.788
Have a good time. Bye.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.168
One for the road.

27:56.883 --> 28:00.428
Driver, The BelAge Hotel,
<i>sil vous plait.</i>

28:04.849 --> 28:07.310
Last call for alcohol.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.937
{\an3}Steve, I don't know
if we should.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.939
I mean, what about all the
no drinking at prom stuff?

28:11.022 --> 28:12.941
Come on, we're not at prom yet.

28:13.024 --> 28:16.486
Besides, you'll have
to excuse this kid.

28:16.569 --> 28:18.113
{\an1}See, he's graduating
a year early.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.281
{\an1}He hasn't figured
life out yet.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.409
{\an1}Wait, Steve, David's right.
What if we get caught?

28:25.578 --> 28:26.496
{\an1}We're not gonna
get caught, Donna.

28:26.579 --> 28:27.789
{\an1}We're just having a couple
glasses of champagne.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.791
{\an1}Besides, if you don't plan
on showing the bottle

28:29.874 --> 28:33.461
to Mrs. Teasley,
who's gonna know?

28:33.545 --> 28:36.923
Well, I guess you're right.

28:37.006 --> 28:40.385
Drink up, kiddies.

28:46.057 --> 28:46.975
Okay, can I make a toast?

28:47.058 --> 28:48.476
Yeah, go aOkay.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.146
{\an3}Well, the first time I've ever
made a toast, so here goes.

28:51.229 --> 28:55.483
{\an1}To a night that we will
all remember

28:55.567 --> 28:56.025

I don't know. Am I?

40:13.786 --> 40:17.164
{\an1}I guess no nookie for you
tonight, eh, Silver?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.999
I'm never gonna get any.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.168
Hey, Steve. Guys.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.169
Taking a little breather?

40:22.253 --> 40:22.837
{\an3}Yeah, you know,
it just got

40:22.920 --> 40:23.712
{\an3}a little stuffy
in there.

40:23.796 --> 40:26.257
Well, have a good time, huh?

40:29.969 --> 40:32.012
{\an3}All right, we've gotta
get her outta here, man.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.139
Somebody's gonna get
a little suspicious,

40:33.222 --> 40:33.848
know what I mean?

40:36.600 --> 40:38.310
{\an3}Donna, just
hold it together

40:38.394 --> 40:38.644
{\an3}until we get across
the lobby, okay?

40:38.727 --> 40:39.645
I can't.

40:39.728 --> 40:41.730
Donna, you've
got to do this.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.399
{\an3}If you get caught,
they'll throw you out.

40:43.482 --> 40:45.734
{\an1}Yeah, and they won't let
you graduate, come on.

40:49.655 --> 40:51.740
DYLAN:
All right, Donna, that's it.

40:51.824 --> 40:54.076
One foot in front of the
other and you can do it.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.119
David, get a limo.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.120
All right.

40:56.203 --> 40:58.998
Okay, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

40:59.081 --> 41:00.708
Ah, whoa, whoa.

41:00.791 --> 41:03.169
{\an3}Hey, too much
to drink.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.714
{\an1}Are you guys
leaving already?

41:06.797 --> 41:08.549
Uh, we, uh, left
something

41:08.632 --> 41:09.550
Oh.the limo.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.343
Well, make sure
you come back inside

41:11.427 --> 41:12.386
in time for the raffle.

41:12.469 --> 41:13.179
We'll be there, Mrs. T.

41:13.262 --> 41:15.097
Later, Mrs. T.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.766
Hey, Donna, get up!

41:19.310 --> 41:21.520
{\an3}Donna, are
you all right?

41:21.604 --> 41:22.897
Hey! Mrs. T,
how you doing?

41:22.980 --> 41:23.898
{\an3}Donna.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.566
Donna, you're drunk.

41:27.193 --> 41:29.445
Do you have any idea
what this means?

41:29.528 --> 41:30.321
(laughs)

41:30.404 --> 41:32.615
That I... I've
had too much to drink.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.704
{\an3}She didn't have
anything to eat today.

41:38.787 --> 41:41.415
Yeah, and we were just gonna
leave with her right now, huh?

41:41.498 --> 41:43.500
{\an3}No.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.590
We'll take it from here.

41:49.673 --> 41:50.841
{\an3}Thank you.

41:53.677 --> 41:55.471
David?

41:56.180 --> 41:57.223
Am I in trouble?
