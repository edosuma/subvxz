00:13.300 --> 00:15.733
- If you're here for the GED,
please have a seat.

00:15.833 --> 00:18.367
We will begin
in exactly two minutes.

00:20.533 --> 00:22.500
Would you like
to find a desk?

00:22.600 --> 00:25.033
- Yeah, I'll do that, right
after you find a personality.

00:25.133 --> 00:26.767
Am I right?

00:26.867 --> 00:28.167
Morning burn.

00:28.267 --> 00:29.200
Get it while it's hot.

00:29.300 --> 00:30.233
Oh, now it's cold.

00:31.767 --> 00:33.200
- Oh, please, my friends
call me Gene.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.933
- Okay, Gene.
- Oh, you're not my friend.

00:35.033 --> 00:36.533
- Miss Russell.
- Present.

00:36.633 --> 00:38.067
- Miss Russell!

00:38.167 --> 00:39.833
You can leave
if you want to.

00:39.933 --> 00:42.267
It doesn't matter to me.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.300
The test begins now.

00:49.767 --> 00:51.000
- I stayed.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.400
- Good for you.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.767
- "A man rents a vacuum cleaner
for $28.84

00:55.867 --> 00:57.500
from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m."--

00:57.600 --> 00:59.167
- You're speaking out loud,
you know?

00:59.267 --> 01:01.067
Oh, sorry.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.733
- * We're too gangsta for TV

01:02.833 --> 01:04.633
* That's why
you don't see us *

01:04.733 --> 01:06.300
* But they still
wanna be us *

01:06.400 --> 01:07.833
Ha ha!

01:18.767 --> 01:20.767
I worked so hard!

01:26.333 --> 01:28.067
- Screw it.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.867
Prison might not
be that bad.

01:29.967 --> 01:31.700
We both watch
"Orange Is the New Black."

01:31.800 --> 01:33.333
You could be the head of

01:33.433 --> 01:37.800
some Christian methy white power
posse in--in two days.

01:37.900 --> 01:40.233
- No, I don't know if I would,

01:40.333 --> 01:42.800
because I passed the test.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.467
- I passed the test.

01:44.567 --> 01:47.733
- I got you, you brainy bitch!

01:47.833 --> 01:49.567
You got big ol' brains, bitch.

01:49.667 --> 01:50.700
- You got big ol' brains,
bitch!

01:50.800 --> 01:52.367
- Well, I got big ol' brains

01:52.467 --> 01:53.733
'cause you gave me
big ol' brains, you bitch.

01:53.833 --> 01:55.700
- What'd you say,
ol' bitch?

01:55.800 --> 01:57.667
I can't understand you when you
talk in that register, bitch.

01:59.133 --> 02:00.467
Yeah, it was crazy.

02:00.567 --> 02:02.400
I kept guessing answers,
but these times,

02:02.500 --> 02:04.533
the guesses were, like,
different than regular guesses.

02:04.633 --> 02:06.233
They were like super guesses.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.467
- Well...

02:08.567 --> 02:10.667
maybe you just
learned something.

02:10.767 --> 02:12.433
- Yeah, maybe.
Who knows?

02:12.533 --> 02:13.467
Don't hold your breath, coach.

02:16.233 --> 02:17.967
So what are you gonna do now?
- Well...

02:18.067 --> 02:19.600
- It feels like your life
kind of has no purpose

02:19.700 --> 02:21.300
now that I've passed my GED.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.500
- Well, I didn't want
to steal your spotlight...

02:25.233 --> 02:27.933
- But I had a phone interview
yesterday with UCLA,

02:28.067 --> 02:30.100
and there's an opening
in the history department,

02:30.200 --> 02:32.100
so all I've got to do is
nail my demo lecture tomorrow,

02:32.200 --> 02:35.100
and it's all good, baby!

02:35.200 --> 02:36.767
- I'll get it.
Can you grab my water?

02:36.867 --> 02:38.267
I'm a little thirsty.
- Oh, yeah.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.467
- Getting sweaty
with some b-ball!

02:40.567 --> 02:42.667
- Strenuous.
- Thanks.

02:44.267 --> 02:46.333
Tomorrow?

02:46.433 --> 02:48.933
- Uh, nothing, except you
have a fear of public speaking.

02:49.067 --> 02:50.933
I mean, have you been
working on this at all?

02:51.067 --> 02:54.600
- Well, I have been
teaching you for a year.

02:54.700 --> 02:58.100
- Yeah, but I'm, like, one
person and an excellent pupil.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.500
Slam dunk!

03:00.600 --> 03:02.333
- Yeah, well, I've been
working on my lectures.

03:02.433 --> 03:05.367
It's not like
I'm gonna go in cold, you know?

03:05.467 --> 03:08.167
Nothing but net!

03:08.267 --> 03:09.667
- Oh, my God.

03:09.767 --> 03:12.600
It's a taco
that tastes like a Dorito.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.233
This is nuts.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.300
- Tell me the truth.
If it's bad, I can handle it.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.400
- It's not gonna be bad.
Let's hear it.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.733
Come on.
Whoo, Billie!

03:19.833 --> 03:21.600
- All right.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.400
Oh, I'll wait.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.133
- Billie, there's gonna be
a lot of people staring at you.

03:25.233 --> 03:27.067
Actually, this might be
good practice.

03:27.167 --> 03:29.833
Stay there, Joy.
- All right.

03:29.933 --> 03:34.467
The flaming arrow was first
discovered by Sir Gawain of Noth

03:34.567 --> 03:37.800
when he pulled his own arrow
from a burning body

03:37.900 --> 03:41.067
only to find
the tip ignited.

03:41.167 --> 03:43.567
How can I appreciate
medieval weaponry

03:43.667 --> 03:45.267
if I'm not familiarized

03:45.367 --> 03:48.400
with the political diaspora
of the time?

03:48.500 --> 03:50.067
Let's get--

03:50.167 --> 03:54.067
And that's what really puts
the sword in the...

03:58.900 --> 04:00.500
In the stone.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.667
- Shut up.

04:05.767 --> 04:09.533
Oh, my gosh, how long was I--
how long were you talking?

04:09.633 --> 04:11.200
Like, two hours?

04:11.300 --> 04:13.300
- Five minutes.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.867
- Oh, my God.

04:14.967 --> 04:17.433
That was, like,
the best sleep I've ever gotten.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.133
- Are you laughing
or are you crying?

04:22.233 --> 04:23.867
- This is laughing.

04:23.967 --> 04:25.100
- Okay, let's do

04:25.200 --> 04:28.133
some confidence-building
exercises, yeah?

04:28.233 --> 04:30.367
- Okay.

04:30.467 --> 04:33.433
- Okay.
First off, no notes.

04:33.533 --> 04:35.400
All right?
Notes are for nerds.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.367
That's why they both begin
with the letter N.

04:37.467 --> 04:38.733
- I think you gave me
a paper cut.

04:38.833 --> 04:41.100
- Oh, let me see.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.067
- Ahh!
- Second rule: Toughen up.

04:43.167 --> 04:45.467
You got to walk in that
classroom like you own a joint.

04:45.567 --> 04:47.267
Marijuana.

04:47.367 --> 04:48.633
It's bleeding now.

04:48.733 --> 04:50.367
- And C:
just like in prison,

04:50.467 --> 04:53.600
you want to find the baddest
badass and kick their ass bad.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.267
- Okay, this sounds dangerous.

04:56.367 --> 04:57.667
- Oh.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.967
It is.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.600
- Do you have something
in your throat?

05:02.700 --> 05:04.267
- Yeah, there is something.
I think it's Dorito.

05:04.367 --> 05:07.267

plays]

05:07.367 --> 05:10.067
*

05:10.167 --> 05:12.067
Motivate me.
Teach me.

05:12.167 --> 05:13.367
- I'm trying.
- Motivate.

05:13.467 --> 05:16.100
- The flaming arrow!

05:16.200 --> 05:18.867
-* 'Cause I've been blasting
and laughing so long *

05:18.967 --> 05:22.300

that my mind is gone, but-- *

* Been spending
most their lives *

* Living in

05:34.433 --> 05:36.767

05:36.867 --> 05:40.267
* Living in
a gangsta's paradise *

05:40.367 --> 05:42.567
* We keep spending
most our lives *

05:42.667 --> 05:44.167
* Living in
a gangsta's paradise *

05:44.267 --> 05:45.400
- Congrats, teach.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.600
You've officially got
my attention.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.533
- Oh, nice.

05:49.633 --> 05:51.667
You think--
yeah, you think I can do it?

05:51.767 --> 05:53.867
- Does a bear
sit in the woods?

05:53.967 --> 05:56.533
- Oh, yeah.
I guess it does.

05:56.633 --> 06:00.767
Unless it's a polar bear.
Then it sits in a frozen tundra.

06:00.867 --> 06:01.800
- Billie.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.433
- "Just remember,
you're 'someting' special.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.733
"Oops, I said 'someting'
instead of 'something.'

06:08.833 --> 06:11.233
Makes me sound hella Asian."

06:11.333 --> 06:13.733
- Hella Asian
or hella racist?

06:13.833 --> 06:15.800
- Oh.
- 'Cause you said "someting."

06:15.900 --> 06:17.633
- I was just reading something
else that someone wrote.

06:17.733 --> 06:19.333
I like Asian.

06:19.433 --> 06:22.300
- Oh, like, I like--

06:22.400 --> 06:24.600
- 'Cause I can't think
of a thing.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.067
- You really--
I'm Cal, Ren History.

06:26.167 --> 06:27.433
I'm joking around.
- Oh, oh.

06:27.533 --> 06:29.267
- I'm shock-proof
when it comes to comedy.

06:29.367 --> 06:30.767
Oh, good, good.

06:30.867 --> 06:32.433
- I'm not racist at all.
- Good.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.567
- My first wife
was half African-American.

06:34.667 --> 06:35.833
- Oh, congrat...

06:35.933 --> 06:37.433
- Maybe a quarter.
- ulations.

06:37.533 --> 06:38.800
- You must be Ms. Brown.
- I am.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.633
- Yes.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.067
- The kids are on fleek.
You're gonna dig 'em.

06:42.133 --> 06:43.833
- Yeah, yeah.

06:43.933 --> 06:46.667
- I'm a little--to--honest,
I'm a little nervous.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.333
- Yeah, great to meet ya.
- Great to meet--

06:48.433 --> 06:49.733
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

06:49.833 --> 06:51.300
- Right on, welcome.
- Right on, welco--

06:51.400 --> 06:52.333
- Right on, welcome.
- Thank you.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.900
- And voila.

06:55.067 --> 06:56.800
Hmm?

06:56.900 --> 07:01.433
"Ankle deep in dat dick."

07:01.533 --> 07:03.533
- Oh, crap.
I forgot about that.

07:03.633 --> 07:06.533
- As a representative
of the state of California,

07:06.633 --> 07:07.933
you, Genevieve Russell...

07:08.067 --> 07:09.933
- Oh, my friends
call me Gene.

07:10.067 --> 07:13.067
- Have officially completed the
full term of your house arrest.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.600
- You're not my friend.
Get it?

07:14.700 --> 07:16.200
- In compliance
with your parole,

07:16.300 --> 07:19.533
you are obligated
to acquire a job within 30 days.

07:19.633 --> 07:22.200
If not, you will have
to continue your sentence

07:22.300 --> 07:25.100
either in the house,
or worse, jail.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.200
- I was looking forward
to the surprise

07:28.300 --> 07:30.367
I was gonna see on your face
at this moment.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.467
- Why are you
excited about that?

07:31.567 --> 07:33.367
- It's just as I pictured it.

07:33.467 --> 07:34.900
In all sincerity,

07:35.067 --> 07:36.733
I know this has been
a tough road for you,

07:36.833 --> 07:39.867
and congratulations.

07:39.967 --> 07:43.600
- That means a lot to me--

07:44.700 --> 07:45.767
- I don't think so.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.567
- Thank you.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.067
Whoo!

08:01.167 --> 08:03.333
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

08:04.767 --> 08:06.600
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.267
- You're the coolest,
Professor Crame.

08:08.367 --> 08:10.600
- Oh, cool it, Vance.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.333
But thank ya.

08:12.433 --> 08:14.267
We have a guest speaker.

08:14.367 --> 08:15.267
all: Aww.

08:15.367 --> 08:16.600
- Guys, be easy.

08:16.700 --> 08:19.833
She's here
to talk about weaponry--

08:19.933 --> 08:22.500
exciting--
of the mid-1600s.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.067
I pass the torch.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.200
Give her a round of applause,
the way we do!

08:27.933 --> 08:29.067
It's all yours.
Take 'em away.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.233
These kids are on fleek.
Run.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.433
- All right.

08:32.533 --> 08:36.167
Just gonna get this up...

08:36.267 --> 08:37.200
here.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.733
*

08:48.367 --> 08:50.967
Oh, it's colder.

08:51.067 --> 08:52.733
Should have brought a jacket.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.733
Tropical fruit bars.
Hmm.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.667
Hi, I'm Gene.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.567
"Income tax."

09:01.667 --> 09:02.967
Gross.

09:03.067 --> 09:06.300
Oh, yeah, man.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.967
"Help wanted"?

09:09.067 --> 09:12.500
Jobs. Job.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.233
Nah, man, you wish.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.500
Nice pink blanket.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.800
- The halberd,

09:22.900 --> 09:24.233
both a sticking knife--

09:24.333 --> 09:28.233
whoa--and a hook axe.

09:28.333 --> 09:35.133
The halberd was also originally
used, funnily enough, for?

09:35.233 --> 09:36.200
Anyone?

09:38.400 --> 09:39.467
Would you all--

09:39.567 --> 09:41.533
- Guys, turn your phones off.

09:41.633 --> 09:44.067
Uh, have a little respect
for the process.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.800
I think
I'm just gonna go early.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.200
- Yeah.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.967
I don't think
I'm cut out for--

09:58.667 --> 10:01.667
[laughter becomes
slow and distorted]

10:01.767 --> 10:05.467
Gene: Remember, Billie: WWMPD.

10:05.567 --> 10:07.167
What would
Michelle Pfeiffer do?

10:07.267 --> 10:08.467
- Thanks, Gene.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.233
- Ms. Brown,
is there a problem?

10:10.333 --> 10:12.633
- Yeah, her lesson.

10:12.733 --> 10:14.200
- Hey, jean jacket.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.733
you.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.467
[Coolio's "Gangsta's Paradise"
plays]

10:18.567 --> 10:19.567
Y'all think this is funny?

10:22.433 --> 10:24.867
Take that out of your ears.
- Steven, leave it in.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.300
He has a hearing aid.
- Oh.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.467
This  ain't funny.

10:27.567 --> 10:29.333
Ain't nothing funny here.

10:29.433 --> 10:31.800
Do I look like
a stand

10:31.900 --> 10:33.400
Do you see a brick wall
behind me?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.167
Do I resemble Bernie Mac?

10:35.267 --> 10:36.967
This  right here,

10:37.067 --> 10:40.800
this  right here is real.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.367
- Okay.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.433
- 'Cause this is
about your minds.

10:44.533 --> 10:47.233
Your dangerous minds.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.900
What?

10:49.000 --> 10:53.967
And I'll tell you what,
gangstas, playas, player hatas--

10:54.067 --> 10:56.000
- Don't do that.

10:58.333 --> 11:01.967
- My book.
- Your book is history.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.767
Boom. Y'all feel me?

11:03.867 --> 11:06.800
I'm sorry, what?
Do you feel me?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.967
- Yeah.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.167
- Ms. Brown,
do you have anything to teach?

11:10.267 --> 11:12.967
"

11:13.067 --> 11:15.133
all: Yes.
- Cool.

11:15.233 --> 11:16.700
- Ms. Brown,
can I speak with you outside

11:16.800 --> 11:17.700
for a minute, please?

11:17.800 --> 11:19.633
- Yeah. Come on.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.933
- Don't do it, guys,
unless you want to.

11:24.067 --> 11:26.067
But if you don't want to,
you don't have to do it.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.633
you.

11:27.733 --> 11:29.767
Gene.

11:29.867 --> 11:32.933
Sex? Yes, please.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.433
"Austin Powers" ref.

11:35.533 --> 11:37.633
That's gonna get me the job
for sure.

11:37.733 --> 11:38.767
City?

11:38.867 --> 11:40.333
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my gosh.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.833
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.700
I didn't see you.
- Don't worry.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.900
It happens all day long.

11:47.067 --> 11:49.567
- Nope.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.700
But I did in Nam.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.567
This place
really brings me back.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.433
I was a prisoner of war,
you know.

11:56.533 --> 11:59.367
- I know what you mean.
I sort of was too.

11:59.467 --> 12:02.267
- Well, thank you
for your service.

12:02.367 --> 12:04.567
- Oh, trust me.
You'd know if I serviced you.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.467
Afternoon burn.

12:06.567 --> 12:09.400
- I sit here every day
in awe of how the world

12:09.500 --> 12:12.400
will never know
the things I've seen.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.733
Unless you've been in our shoes,
there's no way to explain it.

12:16.833 --> 12:19.167
- You're right, new Chet.

12:19.267 --> 12:20.800
Cheteran.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.900
.

12:23.067 --> 12:24.767
- I saw some this morning.

12:24.867 --> 12:27.100
You ever had a taco
that tastes like a Dorito?

12:27.200 --> 12:30.300
- They tell you to conform.
"Go get a job."

12:30.400 --> 12:34.333
Does Uncle Sam call me
and ask me if I'm ready?

12:34.433 --> 12:40.300
I've served my time, America,
so I ain't moving.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.400
- Come on, Grandpappy.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.133
Let's go home.

12:45.233 --> 12:47.500
- Remember what I said.

12:51.133 --> 12:53.533
- Hey.

12:53.633 --> 12:57.067
Psych about wanting a job.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.833
I served my time.

13:01.233 --> 13:03.567
- We're gonna
reject your application.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.900
- Okay.

13:06.067 --> 13:07.567
"Those who can't teach,

13:07.667 --> 13:09.367
well, they just live."
- Mm-hmm.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.433
- So just live your life, but
you ain't gonna live it here.

13:11.533 --> 13:16.567
Peace.
You're dead to me.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.433
- Stupid UCLA.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.167
I'll show you, CLA.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.933
- Surprise!

13:23.067 --> 13:25.333
- Hey, Rob!
We wanted to throw you and Gene

13:25.433 --> 13:27.233
a little party
for all your hard work,

13:27.333 --> 13:29.167
and I invited
all your friends.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.667
See, there's Gene,
and there's Joy over there,

13:31.767 --> 13:33.500
and the ambassador to Palau
right there.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.167
- Great friends.
- Mm-hmm.

13:35.267 --> 13:38.833
- I think I'd rather just
go to my room and hang myself.

13:38.933 --> 13:40.233
- No, come on,
you do that every night.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.067
Attention, everybody.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.700
Our little Robert over here
has had some big news too.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.533
- I didn't--I--
- Yes, she did.

13:46.633 --> 13:51.333
She got offered a position
of a professorship at UCLA.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.100
- Whoo-hoo!

13:53.200 --> 13:54.500
- I guess they do that
with women too.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.167
I don't know.

13:56.267 --> 13:58.067
You got that, right?

13:58.133 --> 14:00.133
- I--y--

14:00.233 --> 14:01.633
I did. I got it.
- Yeah.

14:01.733 --> 14:03.433
Let's party.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.400
- I love parties!

14:07.500 --> 14:09.567
And Japan.
- You love Japan.

14:09.667 --> 14:10.900
- Congratulations.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.133
My nephew is
a sophomore at UCLA.

14:13.233 --> 14:15.800
I'll have him
take your little class.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.233
- Uh, you could,
or you could--

14:17.333 --> 14:19.067
and I mean this
in the nicest possible way--

14:19.167 --> 14:22.167
mind your business/
shut the  up.

14:22.267 --> 14:24.533
Sorry.

14:24.633 --> 14:26.500
- Did you know that apparently
I have to get a job

14:26.600 --> 14:28.300
or I go back
on house arrest?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.800
Well, too sad, so bad,
Sister Sergeant.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.067
I ain't doing it.
It's bull!

14:33.100 --> 14:34.567
?

14:34.667 --> 14:37.300
I did what you told me to do.
I Pfeiffed it out.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.500
And thanks to your brain-dead
brain's advice,

14:39.600 --> 14:41.467
my dream job
went down the dream drain.

14:41.567 --> 14:44.967
- I am very mad and very upset
about everything you just said,

14:45.067 --> 14:46.400
but I would also like
to switch gears

14:46.500 --> 14:47.833
and say how happy I am
that you didn't get it,

14:47.933 --> 14:49.233
because now
you can stay with me

14:49.333 --> 14:51.133
and you can go with me
to the Army surplus store,

14:51.233 --> 14:53.067
and I can park my wheelchair,
and you can change my catheter.

14:53.133 --> 14:55.967
- I would never, ever stay here,
even if you paid me,

14:56.067 --> 14:57.833
which you already did.

14:57.933 --> 15:02.200
I would rather kill myself than
stay here another day, bitch.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.733
- I called you a bitch.

15:08.567 --> 15:11.233
Why don't you get in a car
and find a cliff,

15:11.333 --> 15:16.067
and then,
when you find that cliff,

15:16.100 --> 15:17.167
take the car that you're in
and drive off of a cliff,

15:17.267 --> 15:19.367
you freaking bitch?

15:19.467 --> 15:21.267
- Good advice. I will.

15:21.367 --> 15:22.467
And you know what else?

15:22.567 --> 15:24.167
- I'll land in the ocean

15:24.267 --> 15:26.267
because I am smart enough
to build a car that floats,

15:26.367 --> 15:30.533
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"-style,
you  bitch.

15:30.633 --> 15:32.967
- Okay, well, I have
several shark homies

15:33.067 --> 15:34.867
that I can reach out to,
and they could smell you

15:34.967 --> 15:38.267
and lead me to you,
you  bitch.

15:38.367 --> 15:39.967
- Well, then, I'll give 'em
a little shark sleeping pill,

15:40.067 --> 15:42.467
and they'll be all like,
zzz, ,

15:42.567 --> 15:44.167
you Shirley Temple-headed bitch!

15:44.267 --> 15:45.467
- I am not a drink!

15:47.533 --> 15:48.767
Cheteran was right.

15:48.867 --> 15:50.767
You have no idea
what I've been through.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.067
3 ounces of weed
and a box of honuts?

15:55.133 --> 15:57.300
- Donuts for whores.

15:57.400 --> 16:01.367
- All right.
Attention, everyone.

16:01.467 --> 16:04.567
Tonight is about
my lovely daughter, Gene...

16:04.667 --> 16:06.433
The nightmare.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.367
- And her brilliant tutor,
Roberta.

16:09.467 --> 16:12.333
The nightmare.
- I already did that.

16:12.433 --> 16:14.500
- Now, I understand Robert
has prepared a little something,

16:14.600 --> 16:16.300
have you, Robert?
- No.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.733
I have something prepared
that's better, so can I...

16:17.833 --> 16:19.800
- All right, honey.
Yeah, go ahead.

16:19.900 --> 16:23.267
- This is better than
whatever Billie was gonna say.

16:23.367 --> 16:27.333
I just wanted to say
thank you to all the people

16:27.433 --> 16:30.233
that helped me
through my sentence.

16:30.333 --> 16:33.233
Uh, of course there's
my loving father, Dad Russell.

16:35.900 --> 16:39.300
Um, big ups to my awesome
stepmother from another brother.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.800
Where's Tanzy?

16:40.900 --> 16:42.400
- You're welcome.

16:44.267 --> 16:46.833
- Uh, the mail guy
always brought cool letters

16:46.933 --> 16:50.067
and fun coupons, so let's
give it to--give it up for him.

16:51.833 --> 16:54.500
And, oh, my gosh.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.800
I almost forgot
the most important person.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.433
Wow.

16:59.533 --> 17:02.667
She's the, uh, wind
beneath my chicken wings.

17:04.667 --> 17:07.067
My best friend

17:07.100 --> 17:09.233
and the person
I trust the most.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.800
Joy.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.800
Thanks, Joy. Thank you.
- Excuse me.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.467
- Yeah.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.867
- And, oh, almost forgot
about Robert's slide show.

17:22.967 --> 17:24.700
Robert, are you here, bud?
- No!

17:24.800 --> 17:26.433
- I've got it, Mr. Russell.

17:26.533 --> 17:28.400
- All right.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.633
- Oh, that's us.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.133
all: Aww.

17:37.233 --> 17:39.367
- That was nice.
Nice.

17:39.467 --> 17:41.867
*

17:44.800 --> 17:49.467
Uh, I'm sure
everything's just, uh, fine.

17:50.567 --> 17:51.533
- Sirens!

17:51.633 --> 17:53.233
- Hello--evening, officers.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.900
What can I do you for?
- We got a call.

17:55.067 --> 17:56.867
There's a woman looking like
she's gonna jump.

17:56.967 --> 17:59.600
Oh!
, Billie.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.800
- Ma'am, please do not jump.

18:01.900 --> 18:05.633
- I'm not gonna jump, you idiot.
I just needed some air.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.700
Stop looking up my dress,
Ambassador.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.100
I can see you.
- I can't understand the jumper.

18:10.200 --> 18:13.067
- Here, give it to me.
Give it to me.

18:13.100 --> 18:14.567
Billie.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.567
It's me, Gene,

18:16.667 --> 18:18.900
from when you interviewed
for the babysitter position.

18:19.067 --> 18:20.333
- I know who you are.

18:22.467 --> 18:23.900
The truth is, no one knows

18:24.067 --> 18:27.267
what I've been through
this year but you,

18:27.367 --> 18:29.933
and I'm scared to death
of moving forward

18:30.067 --> 18:32.900
without you helping me all like,
"Gene, do this,"

18:33.067 --> 18:35.567
or, "Gene,
you're allergic to that,"

18:35.667 --> 18:38.533
or, "Gene, you've already seen
'Center Stage,' remember?

18:38.633 --> 18:40.067
"It's the one
about the competing ballerinas

18:40.100 --> 18:41.200
and eating disorders."

18:41.300 --> 18:43.333
- No more examples!
I get it.

18:43.433 --> 18:49.600
- Point is, I took it out
on you, and that's not fair.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.067
I need to let you move on,

18:51.100 --> 18:54.700
even if I'm too scared to
myself.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.200
- I'm scared too.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.233
- I can't even hear a word.

18:57.333 --> 18:58.833
You guys?
- No, uh-uh.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.600
- I'm talking.
I'm not that far away.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.900
- Okay.
I'm gonna toss this up.

19:06.067 --> 19:06.933
Nice catch.

19:07.067 --> 19:08.967
- Yeah, good deal.
- Yeah.

19:09.067 --> 19:11.333
- I'm scared too.

19:11.433 --> 19:13.233
I'm scared
I'm gonna be a failure--

19:13.333 --> 19:15.100
Oh.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.467
I'm sorry. Weird beep.

19:21.067 --> 19:23.733
- Oh. Oh. Oh.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.067
- Oh, got it.
- I'm sorry.

19:25.167 --> 19:26.433
- Go get her.
- Gentlemen, please.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.467
If you could just--
- No, no, no, no.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.633
She's coming in.
- Oh.

19:28.733 --> 19:31.433
- Whoops.
- Hey, pigs!

19:33.200 --> 19:35.600
Uh,  you.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.067
- Okay, let's go.
- Honey, no.

19:37.167 --> 19:38.967
That's not--
Gene, that's not good.

19:39.067 --> 19:40.400
I'm so sorry.
- Gene, I'm coming.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.933
- Billie, run!
- Oh, whoa, whoa. Careful.

19:43.067 --> 19:45.333
That's my little girl there.
What's the rush, huh?

19:45.433 --> 19:47.567
Where's the fire, huh?
Why don't you--

19:47.667 --> 19:49.633
I got an idea.
Why don't you both stay, huh?

19:49.733 --> 19:52.133
You can stay,
have a couple of piña cop-ladas.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.767
I'm gonna write an amount down
on a little piece of paper.

19:54.867 --> 19:56.067
You're gonna be very happy.

19:56.167 --> 19:58.833
- You'll never take us alive!

20:03.233 --> 20:05.000
Holy , Billie!

20:05.100 --> 20:08.767
I can't believe
you just did that.

20:08.867 --> 20:09.833
I love you, Billie.

20:09.933 --> 20:14.533
- I love you too, Gene.

20:20.433 --> 20:24.267
*

20:24.367 --> 20:25.667
Gene!

20:28.400 --> 20:30.000
It won't open.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.033
What are you doing?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.967
Don't get out.

20:38.033 --> 20:41.100
- I was trying to escape.
- Hurry, hurry.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.200
- I was trying
to go out the back.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.767
- They're coming.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.367
- They're coming!

20:45.467 --> 20:53.400
*

20:58.667 --> 21:01.233
- So many adventures.
- They're right behind us.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.333
- It's like "Bill & Ted's,"
but it's "Bill & Gene's."

21:03.433 --> 21:05.600
- It's not us.
They went that way.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.733
- * We're too gangsta for TV

21:07.833 --> 21:09.633
* That's why you don't see us,
but they-- *

21:11.733 --> 21:16.767
* Ha

21:18.867 --> 21:22.300
- * It's a little wild
and a little strange *

21:22.400 --> 21:23.433
* When you make a home...

21:23.533 --> 21:25.433
- You solved it, Gene.

21:25.533 --> 21:28.233
- Thanks, David Brisbin
from "Hey Dude."
