WEBVTT

00:13.931 --> 00:18.095
Yorkshire pudding? Gravy?

00:18.186 --> 00:21.144
Hells to the bells, yes.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.640
Yeah, hold on.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.232
--What?
--Hey, babe, what's our dance card

00:27.320 --> 00:28.730
like on Sunday?

00:28.821 --> 00:31.107
I can't really check the
day-timer right now, Kenz.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.487
But it's Trick. He's making
a Sunday roast at the Dal.

00:34.577 --> 00:37.910
What do you say, you, me,
our elastic-waist sweats?

00:37.997 --> 00:39.112
[BO] I can't.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.071
Why not?

00:40.166 --> 00:41.451
[BO] 'Cause I'll be busy.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.577
Busy with what?

00:42.668 --> 00:45.751
Knock yourself out. I need a night in.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.170
Well, I'll be there with
my monogrammed steak knife.

00:48.257 --> 00:51.749
But Bo, alas, sends her regrets.

00:51.844 --> 00:55.177
Yeah, uh, she can't
really talk right now.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.676
She's jammed right up.

00:57.767 --> 01:00.474
[groaning]

01:03.314 --> 01:06.226
Hey, sugar crotch,
how was the car service?

01:06.317 --> 01:08.774
Oh, we'll definitely be
keeping him on speed dial.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.237
But renegade Goblin or not,

01:10.321 --> 01:14.360
that is the last time I jump out
a third floor window for a case.

01:14.450 --> 01:17.817
Now, I know you were
un petit peu ocupado back there

01:17.912 --> 01:19.777
getting bang-healed
and everything, but

01:19.872 --> 01:22.454
is there any other reason
you're avoiding all calls

01:22.541 --> 01:23.576
from the merry Trickster?

01:23.668 --> 01:26.250
You mean other than the fact that
I had a vision in which I kill him?

01:26.337 --> 01:28.077
Yeah, I mean, like, do you
owe him huge on your bar tab

01:28.172 --> 01:29.912
or did you steal his troll or--

01:30.007 --> 01:32.043
Wait, wait, what?

01:32.134 --> 01:34.386
Kill him? Kill Trick?

01:34.470 --> 01:39.214
The Nain Rouge gave me a vision.
Somehow, he was dead by my hands.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.219
--Does he know?
--No.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.050
Which is why he's getting pushy.
[cell phone ringing]

01:43.145 --> 01:44.806
So, you know, until I
know what the deal is--

01:44.897 --> 01:47.559
Yeah, no happy-times,
gravy hour in the shire, huh?

01:47.650 --> 01:50.232
Well, hello, Doctor.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.184
What?

01:52.280 --> 01:53.895
Where?

01:53.990 --> 01:55.446
--Come on.
--What? No!

01:55.533 --> 01:59.651
We have to sit down and process this.

01:59.745 --> 02:03.329
Preferably with the roast beef
sandwich l'm suddenly craving.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.056
Found you.

02:26.272 --> 02:29.355
Hey, Lauren, where's
the mystery patient?

02:29.442 --> 02:32.275
Apparently, he was just
dumped here last night.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.283
[BO] Oh, wow.

02:41.370 --> 02:42.450
What happened?

02:42.538 --> 02:45.450
Well, a jumping back kick
and a tornado of fists.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.907
--Excuse me?
--He's a fighter. Mixed martial arts.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.538
Guy made a meal out of me.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.540
What kind of a son of a bitch
can do that to an Ogre?

02:52.631 --> 02:53.882
You're an Ogre?

02:53.966 --> 02:55.126
Tough as they come.

02:55.217 --> 02:56.502
What kind of Fae did this to you?

02:56.594 --> 03:00.303
--That's the thing, Bo, it--
--Wasn't a Fae. It was a damn human.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.721
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.724
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.727
My love carries a death sentence.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.900
l was lost for years,

03:14.987 --> 03:17.649
searching, while hiding,

03:17.740 --> 03:21.904
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:21.994 --> 03:26.863
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.922
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.212
That hurts. It hurts.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.914
I'm worried about
internal haemorrhaging.

03:37.009 --> 03:37.919
Oscar, I really think--

03:38.010 --> 03:39.716
No way. I'm not going
back to the lab with you.

03:39.804 --> 03:41.294
If I do, the Ash is going to find out.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.299
Find out what?

03:42.390 --> 03:44.301
Well, the fights, they're not
strictly sanctioned.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.849
--Dislocated shoulder.
--I didn't even notice.

03:46.936 --> 03:49.598
So, you're talking about
illegal, underground fights?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.553
Dude, how do we score tix?

03:51.649 --> 03:53.389
Well, if Oscar doesn't
tell us everything,

03:53.484 --> 03:55.600
then I'm going to have to write
a report for the Ash and--

03:55.694 --> 03:59.107
All right. All right.

03:59.198 --> 04:00.187
This guy named Ferraro,

04:00.282 --> 04:03.240
he runs these human fights
out of his gym, totally secret.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.784
Invite only for the live Fae audience.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.123
There's a dead audience, too?

04:08.207 --> 04:10.619
I am not dealing with
any more Zombies.

04:10.709 --> 04:14.702
No, no, no, no, he gives these paying
viewers a password to a website.

04:14.797 --> 04:17.834
People all over the world
can watch and bet online.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.916
It's big, big business.

04:20.970 --> 04:22.756
So, this Ferraro, he's Dark Fae?

04:22.847 --> 04:26.214
No, Light. Well connected,
real pillar-of-the-community type.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.594
Yeah, sure he is. So, how did
you get involved with him?

04:28.686 --> 04:31.348
There's this human and he's
won, like, twelve fights in a row

04:31.439 --> 04:33.179
and the audience is
getting real bored of him.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.856
Destroys opponents in,
like, two seconds,

04:35.943 --> 04:38.059
but he's only fought humans.

04:38.154 --> 04:41.692
So, Ferraro secretly brings
in this bad-ass Ogre.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.443
The things that this guy
did to me in the ring,

04:43.534 --> 04:45.900
I ain't ever seen a
human do that before.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.405
Something ain't right with him.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.578
A human cockfighting ring?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.372
--With a superhuman human
--Keep the joke inside.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.202
pounding on people for
Fae pleasure and profit?

04:55.296 --> 04:57.753
No way. I'm shutting it down, pronto.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.501
I thought you might.

04:59.592 --> 05:01.207
Help me with this.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.917
Turn and pull on three.

05:03.012 --> 05:03.797
Okay.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.211
Wait, wait, wait.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.342
You got to promise not
to tell the Ash about this.

05:07.433 --> 05:08.843
I got a wife and brood at home.

05:08.934 --> 05:12.927
If they ship me off for forty years to
crush uranium, who's going to provide?

05:13.022 --> 05:15.559
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with us.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.901
I know someone we can trust.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.274
One, two, three.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.448
No human could do that to an Ogre.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.327
So, a Fae has been pulling some
underhanded crap, big surprise.

05:34.418 --> 05:38.582
I don't buy it. Salvatore Ferraro, he doesn't
have any dirt on him, Bo, he's clean.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.253
--As far as you know.
--He's a stand-up guy.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.172
He's a self-made man, ex-heavyweight.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.422
He helps human immigrants.
He gives them loans, gets them jobs.

05:45.513 --> 05:48.630
So, he has a steady supply
of bodies to throw into the ring.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.591
His gym is legit. He sits on
the board for the hospital.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.016
He gives to charity. He's a pillar--

05:53.103 --> 05:54.354
Pillar of the community.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.726
Yeah, boy howdy, has this
guy ever perfected his cover.

05:57.816 --> 06:01.775
Look, I know you don't like humans
being used for Fae spectacle,

06:01.862 --> 06:03.318
but for us, it's just a minor crime.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.566
Even if he's pitting Fae against human,

06:05.658 --> 06:07.990
for a guy like Ferraro,
that's just a slap on the wrist.

06:08.077 --> 06:11.114
Well, what about the human
fighter that can beat up Ogres?

06:11.205 --> 06:16.745
If, and it's a big if, Ferraro is somehow
giving humans Fae powers,

06:16.835 --> 06:18.450
then yes, that is a serious crime.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.377
But I'm going to need
one hell of a smoking gun.

06:20.464 --> 06:23.831
I cannot touch him unless
some hard evidence falls in my lap.

06:23.926 --> 06:28.636
Well, evidence is going to fall so hard,
you're going to be singing soprano.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.680
Bye.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.138
Fighters, scrumptious barbarians

06:39.233 --> 06:42.225
clutching each other's half-naked
bodies while writhing on the floor?

06:42.319 --> 06:45.231
I'm on my way, Bo-Bo.
I'll bring the coconut oil.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.651
Oh. Hi.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.994
I'm sorry. I didn't know
if I should even knock.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.036
Well, it beats kicking
down the door. What?

06:54.123 --> 06:57.911
|just, l have to ask--

06:58.002 --> 07:00.709
do you live with this woman?
Her name is Beth.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.253
Beth? Hmm.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.876
Yeah, sure, maybe.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.753
Why? What are you,
some kind of stalker?

07:06.844 --> 07:09.927
No. More of a hunter.

07:10.014 --> 07:12.255
Do you believe in monsters?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.931
--Why?
--Because you're living with one.

07:23.027 --> 07:24.858
No, no, no, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.153
You let the mayor know I'll be there for
his charity hospital gala on the fourth.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.105
Absolutely, yeah!

07:30.200 --> 07:31.736
Hang on.

07:31.827 --> 07:32.737
Mikey!

07:32.828 --> 07:35.661
Just because you're on a bit of a hot
streak don't mean you can slack off.

07:35.748 --> 07:37.659
What did I get for you,
Mikey, what did I get for you?

07:37.750 --> 07:38.956
Biggest fight of my career, Coach.

07:39.043 --> 07:41.284
Biggest fight of your frickin' life.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.334
You gotta deliver for
the viewers, Mikey.

07:43.422 --> 07:46.505
Showmanship. Showmanship, Mikey.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.048
All right, but don't let the
mayor think he's off the hook.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.345
We're expecting a big-time
donation from him, too.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.423
Good. Good.

07:55.517 --> 07:58.805
Glad to hear the children
won't be disappointed. See ya.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.478
--Hi, I'm--
--Clearly in the wrong place.

08:01.565 --> 08:05.103
We ain't got no box for the yoga
hip hop classes and what have you.

08:05.194 --> 08:07.401
This is a fighter's gym.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.353
I don't need no card girl, either.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.734
Well, that's okay,
I left my bikini at the cleaners.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.076
What are you doing here then?

08:13.160 --> 08:16.527
In a fighting gym? Gee, I can't imagine.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.578
Tough girl, huh?

08:18.666 --> 08:20.247
Thrasher?

08:28.676 --> 08:30.132
Thank you.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.467
It has taken me years,

08:32.554 --> 08:35.466
private investigators,
reporters, friends on the force,

08:35.557 --> 08:37.843
every little scrap they could give me.

08:37.935 --> 08:41.302
Finally, I heard a rumour about
a bartender who left a body behind

08:41.397 --> 08:42.887
in a way that caught my attention.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.973
Then it was just a matter of getting
lucky and spotting Beth in a coffee shop.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.935
I'm sure it's her.
We were friends in high school.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.862
She dated my older brother...

08:51.949 --> 08:54.315
...until he was killed.

08:54.410 --> 08:55.320
What happened?

08:55.411 --> 08:59.199
Beth wasn't allowed to date, but she
was always sneaking out with Kyle.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.450
One night, they went off in his truck

09:01.542 --> 09:05.000
and the next morning, a couple of kids
found him dead in the backseat.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.669
Beth just vanished.

09:07.756 --> 09:13.046
I saw his body. He had this smile on
his face, like some kind of sick joke.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.970
Look, I promise you, Bo--

09:16.056 --> 09:18.547
Beth had nothing to do with that.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.133
Either she killed Kyle or
she knows what happened

09:21.228 --> 09:23.093
and she ran off instead of telling us.

09:23.188 --> 09:26.646
One way or another,
she did something horrible.

09:30.279 --> 09:31.644
Better luck next time, kid.

09:31.739 --> 09:35.277
If you hurry, you might make
spin class down the street.

09:44.042 --> 09:47.079
Unbelievable. You getting
slow on me, Thrasher?

09:47.171 --> 09:51.039
--Convinced?
--Yeah. You got moves.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.169
Let's discuss terms.

09:59.308 --> 10:02.425
You got a stage name,
nomme de guerre, fight moniker?

10:02.519 --> 10:03.975
Bo. Just Bo.

10:04.062 --> 10:07.429
Bo? That's not a name.
Boom-Boom, that's a name.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.980
Boom-Boom?

10:09.985 --> 10:13.102
Trust me, I know marketing.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.776
Now...

10:20.913 --> 10:24.781
Who the Fae are you and
what are you doing in my gym?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.702
Easy, buddy.

10:30.798 --> 10:36.338
I'm just a girl standing in front
of a guy asking for a fight.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.043
Thing is, Boom-Boom,

10:38.138 --> 10:41.130
I've seen enough fighters to know
exactly what's Fae and what's human.

10:41.225 --> 10:44.308
So, exactly what kind of Fae are you?

10:44.394 --> 10:46.726
The unaligned kind.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.770
--That succubus.
--I never chose a side,

10:48.857 --> 10:50.768
so I'm always looking for
ways to make money.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.599
Yeah. How'd you hear about me?

10:52.694 --> 10:55.902
Oscar the Ogre. Said to look
you up if I ever wanted a shot.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.196
Shame about him.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.148
How's he doing?

11:00.244 --> 11:02.610
Pissing into a bag.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.444
What happened there?

11:04.540 --> 11:06.622
One Fae to another?

11:06.708 --> 11:09.836
All I wanted to do was give
Mikey there a decent fight,

11:09.920 --> 11:12.127
but the kid's so flippin' strong.

11:12.214 --> 11:15.832
I got a real beauty
set up for him next fight.

11:15.926 --> 11:21.296
Obsidian Man, Fae.
Totally indestructible.

11:21.390 --> 11:25.053
It's going to be epic.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.395
Go on, hit the bags, do some cardio.

11:27.479 --> 11:28.719
I'm putting you in
against Thrasher tonight,

11:28.814 --> 11:30.600
see what you can do when it's for real.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.182
Thank you for the opportunity.

11:33.277 --> 11:38.772
Hey, membership's one-fifty a month.
Comes off your first fight fee.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.902
Try not to die.

11:43.203 --> 11:48.573
There is just no way that Bo and
this Beth Dennis are the same gals.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.999
Bo was born right here in the big city.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.372
She wouldn't know
a ho from a hoedown.

11:53.463 --> 11:56.045
Okay, of course that
is what she told you.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.919
You could be in real danger.

11:58.010 --> 11:58.840
We need the police.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.009
No! No!

12:01.096 --> 12:03.712
I mean, you can't just call any cops.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.638
Not when I am personal friends

12:05.726 --> 12:08.934
with one of the best homicide
detectives in the city.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.608
[cell phone ringing]

12:16.695 --> 12:18.777
--Hey.
--Well, I'm in.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.695
Got myself a fight and everything.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.443
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.276
I got the unbeatable fighter
in my sights. His name is Mike.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.655
Shouldn't take too
much succubus stylin'

12:26.747 --> 12:28.658
to get him to tell me
what makes him so strong.

12:28.749 --> 12:32.867
lf Ferraro is making this human into
a killing machine, let me know, okay?

12:32.961 --> 12:34.542
Roger dodger.

12:36.757 --> 12:40.249
Turn from the hip.
Arm shoots straight out.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.837
That's it.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.843
Hey, champ.

12:46.934 --> 12:50.347
I heard you got quite the record.
Maybe I can get some pointers, too?

12:50.437 --> 12:53.520
--|'m Bo.
--Mike. How you doing?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.097
This is Tyler.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.683
Hi, Tyler.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.234
So, what's your secret?

12:59.321 --> 13:00.436
Training and diet.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.657
No, what's your secret-secret?

13:02.741 --> 13:04.902
Heard you beat up one
bad-ass mother last night.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.279
You get any help?

13:07.371 --> 13:10.204
Hey, come on. Come on.
Thirty seconds. Fast, fast.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.454
I fight clean. Gotta set
a good example for my boy.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.500
Come on, Mike. Help the new girl out.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.419
Mikey, what'd | tell you about the kid?

13:18.507 --> 13:20.623
You want him to train here,
you got to get him a membership.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.127
I ain't running a frickin' daycare.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.380
Yeah, sorry, Coach.
Wasn't feeling so hot.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.757
Thought it would be
okay while I took a break.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.349
You thought.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.096
Come on, Mikey.

13:32.187 --> 13:37.181
Who are you kidding? There ain't
a single thought in there, yeah.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.652
|t's empty, Mike.

13:39.736 --> 13:43.445
--Don't hit me.
--Oh, yeah. Sorry.

13:45.867 --> 13:46.902
Hey, take it easy.

13:46.994 --> 13:51.158
It's what you do, Mikey. You get hit!

13:51.248 --> 13:53.955
Stop hitting me!

14:00.799 --> 14:02.255
Mike.

14:05.554 --> 14:11.299
Beth, Bo--whatever she's calling
herself now, it's the same girl.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.600
She killed my brother.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.143
You got to do something about her.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.721
Absolutely. This matter will
receive our full attention.

14:17.816 --> 14:21.058
Could you just give
us a moment, please?

14:23.905 --> 14:25.611
Thank you.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.783
--I did not know.
--Yeah, and neither did I,

14:30.871 --> 14:34.034
'til the grieving sister showed up.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.285
We've got to keep her as far
away from Bo as possible.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.162
Make this go away.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.959
--Seriously?
--Yeah. That's what you Fae do.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.753
You hide each other's
dirty laundry from humans.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.877
Okay, well, the thing is Bo is
still not Light Fae, is she?

14:44.968 --> 14:47.129
Bo is always helping everybody else.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.211
Don't you think it's time
somebody helped her?

14:49.306 --> 14:52.673
We're always helping Bo.
But this is big.

14:55.604 --> 14:59.142
Okay. All right.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.142
Send Mel back in.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.896
Maybe a little old smooth talking will
convince her that Bo's not a monster.

15:03.987 --> 15:08.401
Okay. And if that doesn't work,
you'll, like, Siren her or something?

15:08.492 --> 15:09.948
No.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.700
Hey, Mike.

15:12.788 --> 15:14.073
Has this happened before?

15:14.164 --> 15:15.995
Yeah, sure.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.291
Sometimes, I push myself so
hard in a workout, you know.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.083
And the rage?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.205
Was I pretty angry?

15:24.299 --> 15:25.630
You don't remember?

15:25.717 --> 15:28.925
It used to only happen
to me in the ring.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.092
It's getting worse.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.795
What is?

15:34.476 --> 15:39.436
l was an okay fighter,
you know, but I got beat up a lot.

15:39.523 --> 15:42.731
One time, I got hurt pretty bad.

15:42.818 --> 15:46.310
After that, I started winning.

15:47.823 --> 15:51.566
Violent blackouts. That's great.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.992
ls Ferraro giving you
a boost in any way?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.914
No. Like I said, I'm all natural.

16:00.001 --> 16:03.744
Well, I think he's slipping you
something and it's making you sick.

16:05.423 --> 16:09.757
Doesn't matter. One more fight, big one.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.585
Then I'm done.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.716
You be careful with him, okay?

16:13.807 --> 16:15.889
Why? I thought he was a stand-up guy.

16:15.976 --> 16:19.059
Yeah, sure, I mean, he helped
me out when | first came to town.

16:19.146 --> 16:22.229
Gave me a free membership
here so I could train.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.271
Paid for my wife's funeral.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.896
When I lost my job roofing,
he gave me a loan.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.569
I had to work it off
in these fights of his.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.490
I know about that kind of servitude.

16:33.577 --> 16:38.913
Anyway, this fight will pay me enough,
I won't have to fight no more, ever.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.792
Ferraro says to drink up.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.087
You need to regain your strength.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.256
Already got it back, buddy.

16:55.807 --> 16:59.299
One smoking gun, as requested.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.009
More of a bottle than a gun.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.095
Test it. Should reveal what's
been giving a human fighter

17:03.190 --> 17:06.353
superhuman strength
and rage blackouts.

17:06.443 --> 17:09.105
Yes, ma'am. I will rush it to the lab.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.528
I think Ferraro's been slipping him
something from the Fae pharmacy.

17:11.615 --> 17:12.604
Well, if that is the case,

17:12.699 --> 17:16.567
then not even Ferraro's high and mighty
friends would be able to protect him.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.993
Look at us, huh?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.581
Partnering up and stuff.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.077
Yeah, look at us.

17:23.168 --> 17:25.329
Maybe we really can be friends.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.082
Beth?

17:29.174 --> 17:30.630
Mel?

17:31.885 --> 17:33.921
That's her. She killed my brother.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.252
You can't run away anymore.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.008
You're going to pay for
what you did to Kyle.

17:37.098 --> 17:41.011
You are going to face my parents and
see the pain that you caused them.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.940
You knew she was here?

17:49.027 --> 17:50.483
Bo!

17:53.865 --> 17:55.981
Kenzi, what the hell's going on?

18:03.124 --> 18:04.580
Bo, what are you doing?

18:04.668 --> 18:07.751
l have to run, Kenzi, again.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.452
We can fix this.

18:09.547 --> 18:12.289
I killed her brother!

18:12.384 --> 18:13.669
That can never be fixed.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.002
And no matter how much distance
I put between then and now,

18:17.097 --> 18:20.009
Kyle will always be dead
and it will always be my fault.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.341
You should have told
me that Mel was here.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.973
l was just trying to protect you.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.602
Everything bad that has ever
happened to me in my life

18:29.693 --> 18:32.901
has been because someone has
been trying to protect me with lies.

18:32.988 --> 18:35.525
You have no idea
what it was like for me!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.697
No, I don't because you
never told me anything.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.776
Because it was horrifying and awful!

18:40.870 --> 18:43.202
Okay, well, I want to
understand, so tell me.

18:43.290 --> 18:47.829
How could you possibly understand?

18:47.919 --> 18:51.912
I grew up on a farm.
I thought I was a regular girl.

18:52.007 --> 18:55.295
I went to church with my parents.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.091
What happened?

18:59.389 --> 19:01.755
When I hit puberty...

19:03.935 --> 19:06.221
...I started to feel different.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.146
Your powers kicked in.

19:09.232 --> 19:12.099
I didn't know how dangerous I was.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.993
My parents taught me
that sex was evil.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.913
And I found out just
how right they were.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.164
I found out how evil I was.
I had the devil inside of me, Kenzi.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.040
You really thought that?

19:33.131 --> 19:35.338
l was so terrified.

19:35.425 --> 19:39.964
So, I told my parents what happened...

19:40.055 --> 19:46.426
...and they broke down and
told me that l was adopted.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.602
The only thing they had was this...

19:49.689 --> 19:53.898
...this baby picture with
a name written across the back.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.441
Bo.

19:57.489 --> 20:00.401
I hated them.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.029
I hated myself.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.494
So, I ran.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.707
And now, l have to keep running.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.501
[cell phone ringing]

20:13.588 --> 20:15.124
lt's Dyson.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.258
Yeah?

20:21.971 --> 20:23.427
Fine.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.489
[DYSON] Hey.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.235
So, you were right. Mike is doping.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.079
You okay?

20:50.166 --> 20:53.533
Sure. What am I looking at?

20:53.628 --> 20:55.664
It's a biological compound.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.418
Matches the secretions of an
amphibious Fae called the Gama.

20:59.509 --> 21:00.589
Alpha, beta, gummuh?

21:00.677 --> 21:05.011
Gama-Sennin.
Toads, frogs, masters of drugs.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.929
Lots of interesting stuff
comes out of their pores.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.392
So, Mike's been drinking frog sweat?

21:08.476 --> 21:11.559
A lot of aboriginal cultures will lick
a frog before they go on a hunt.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.432
So, drinking Fae frog nectar--

21:13.523 --> 21:17.357
Would give a human fighter
a significant boost in the ring.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.355
Power-shake indeed.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.607
Look, this stuff is going to give
Mike superhuman strength,

21:21.698 --> 21:25.031
but Lauren says it's also
going to kill him and soon.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.734
There's a good chance that the next
time Mike steps into the ring,

21:27.829 --> 21:30.571
the highlight of the fight is going
to be his internal organs exploding.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.451
So, shut down Ferraro's
little fight club.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.659
I need proof that Ferraro
is providing the frog sweat.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.369
His fists have spiky things
coming out of them

21:38.465 --> 21:40.046
like a horned toad or something.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.296
Get me into that fight tonight
and I will find out for sure.

21:43.386 --> 21:44.466
No, no, no. I'm not fighting.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.715
l have to blow town now
that Mel has found me.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.263
Well, we pulled some strings
in the human system.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.638
Got Mel put away for the evening
on a psych evaluation.

21:52.729 --> 21:53.559
For her own protection.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.352
Why would you do that?

21:55.440 --> 22:01.060
Just get me into that fight so that
I can take a sample from Ferraro...

22:01.154 --> 22:02.519
...and then we'll know.

22:02.614 --> 22:08.154
I'm just really not in the mood to
trade punches with anyone right now.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.235
Then keep your distance.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.993
Keep the fight going long enough
so I can get what you need.

22:14.083 --> 22:19.373
Bo, do not let this girl
get under your skin.

22:21.007 --> 22:25.592
Some time or another, we have
all hurt those that we love.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.681
The fight's at nine.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.054
Meet me out back at a quarter to.

22:34.145 --> 22:36.227
You can be my cut man.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.498
[MEL] You can't run away anymore.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.329
You're going to pay for
what you did to Kyle.

23:03.424 --> 23:07.087
You are going to face my parents
and see the pain you caused them.

23:07.178 --> 23:09.965
[KENZI] Bo, it's time.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.593
Kenzi, what are you doing here?

23:12.684 --> 23:14.720
Look, I know you're still pissed,
but I can't have you fighting

23:14.811 --> 23:16.597
without me in your corner.

23:19.232 --> 23:22.645
When this is done...

23:22.735 --> 23:25.568
...l have to keep running.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.067
I guess that makes two of us.

23:47.719 --> 23:51.837
[FERRARO] Welcome to the Cage,
ladies and gentlemen.

23:51.931 --> 23:57.096

24:03.484 --> 24:04.940

24:05.028 --> 24:08.361
And in the grey corner, I give you,

24:08.448 --> 24:11.485

as the virgin snow,

the Sizzle from the Streets,

24:17.749 --> 24:19.865
Boom-Boom!

24:28.635 --> 24:33.755
Tonight's fight is scheduled for as long
as it takes for a knock-out or a tap-out.

24:33.848 --> 24:38.091
And there's one rule,
there are no rules!

24:38.186 --> 24:41.394

swinging at the bell.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.409
Bo, keep your guard up!

25:07.965 --> 25:10.581
Come on, keep her on the
outside with your jab.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.420
You got her, girl. Come on!

25:30.113 --> 25:32.024
Bo, come on, you got this.

25:32.115 --> 25:33.855
Come on, Bo, get up.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.571
[KENZI] Come on, get up
and smash her one.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.296
What have you done?

25:52.301 --> 25:56.294
[KENZI] Bo! What are you doing?

25:56.389 --> 25:57.845
Bo.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.756
Bo, come on.

26:00.852 --> 26:02.592
Hey, Detective.

26:02.687 --> 26:04.769
Does the Ash know you're here?

26:04.856 --> 26:08.974
Played golf with him
last week and I let him win.

26:10.111 --> 26:11.567
Bo!

26:13.322 --> 26:16.314
Bo, what are you doing?

26:16.409 --> 26:18.991
Kind of a lousy fight, huh?

26:22.915 --> 26:24.371
Yes!

26:30.840 --> 26:32.546
Come on.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.624
What the hell are you doing in there?

26:34.719 --> 26:35.799
Did we get what we needed?

26:35.887 --> 26:38.970
His scent's not right.
Ferraro's not the frog.

26:39.056 --> 26:40.091
Oh.

26:40.183 --> 26:41.923
Get her out of there, Kenz.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.106
Just take some of my chi.

26:51.194 --> 26:52.730
Dyson, leave me alone, I'm fine.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.061
Bo, then let me find
someone to help you heal.

26:55.156 --> 26:56.441
| just need to sit.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.193
Bo, why haven't you healed yet?

26:58.284 --> 26:59.364
'Cause I'm not in the mood.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.909
Since when is mood a factor?
Bo, you have a biological imperative--

27:01.996 --> 27:03.861
Oh, screw my biology.

27:03.956 --> 27:07.869
I am so tired of my life being dictated
by something that I didn't choose.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.622
I am done being Fae.

27:10.713 --> 27:12.499
I got this.

27:14.884 --> 27:17.717
One hour, then I have to get
you back to the compound.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.844
Thank you.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.355
I'm sorry.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.100
Come here.

27:30.191 --> 27:31.852
How did you sneak away this time?

27:31.943 --> 27:33.479
--Ow!
--Sorry.

27:33.569 --> 27:38.313
Dyson borrowed me
for an investigation.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.784
I don't think that's
going to need stitches.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.824
Lucky me.

27:42.912 --> 27:45.278
I heard about your
encounter with your past.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.034
Oh, great, does everyone know now?

27:47.124 --> 27:50.366
No. Just the people
that care about you.

27:56.551 --> 28:01.762
It is not just my past, it's my present.

28:01.848 --> 28:07.343
For a long time, I'd forgotten
what I am to humans--a monster.

28:07.436 --> 28:10.849
Bo, you're not a monster. I know that.

28:10.940 --> 28:13.226
And whatever happened
back then, it wasn't your fault.

28:13.317 --> 28:16.434
I killed a boy.

28:16.529 --> 28:20.898
And then what?
Then I ran away. I ran away.

28:20.992 --> 28:23.950
I didn't take responsibility
for what I did.

28:24.036 --> 28:29.030
And his poor family,
I never gave them closure.

28:29.125 --> 28:30.831
You're a different person
than you were then

28:30.918 --> 28:34.957
and the person that you
are now I absolutely love.

28:37.008 --> 28:38.873
I didn't mean...

28:41.429 --> 28:42.794
I don't know what I mean.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.881
Forget it.

28:45.975 --> 28:48.136
I know ou're all mixed u over Nadia.
Y

28:48.227 --> 28:51.060
I don't even know what
I'm feeling these days.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.601
How's that going?

28:54.692 --> 28:57.684
Thank you for the nail.

28:57.778 --> 29:00.520
I'm looking into it.

29:00.615 --> 29:04.324
And the thought of
waking Nadia up is...

29:08.372 --> 29:11.830
But Bo, the thought of losing you...

29:14.378 --> 29:15.959
Huns

29:17.590 --> 29:21.003
No, I mean the spot you're on,
it hurts, really hurts.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.799
Tenden

29:28.059 --> 29:29.549
Come here.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.143
Ow.

29:35.358 --> 29:37.770
Underground fights?
Fae-doping humans?

29:37.860 --> 29:39.316
That would be bad for business.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.485
And a political mess.

29:41.572 --> 29:43.073
l'll build a case around Ferraro.

29:43.157 --> 29:44.943
No, you will most definitely not.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.240
With all due respect--

29:46.327 --> 29:50.445
Under no circumstances are you to be
nosing up the skirt of Salvatore Ferraro.

29:50.539 --> 29:53.155
The man's breaking
a dozen of our own rules.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.458
And you will stand down,

29:56.545 --> 29:58.456
or you'll find yourself on a new beat,

29:58.547 --> 30:02.836
playing sheepdog on the rocky
shores of the Outer Hebrides.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.181
Sir.

30:25.157 --> 30:29.150
You lock me up on a trumped-up
psych form like I'm a crazy person.

30:29.245 --> 30:31.611
I am not insane.
She killed my brother.

30:31.706 --> 30:34.163
And if you don't believe me,
you are all in league with her.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.535
What am I going to tell my parents?

30:35.626 --> 30:39.744
Look, I know this has been
difficult for you. I understand.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.454
But I have something to tell you.

30:41.549 --> 30:44.791
Did you talk to her? Did she confess?

30:44.885 --> 30:47.422
You're going to want
to sit down for this.

30:49.974 --> 30:51.805
Okay, here's what we do.

30:51.892 --> 30:55.100
We-We bring down Ferraro and
when we do, we topple the Ash.

30:55.187 --> 30:59.180
And then Lauren might have
a real chance at freedom. What?

30:59.275 --> 31:00.105
It just sounds like the plan

31:00.192 --> 31:02.478
of someone who's going to be
sticking around for a while.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.401
No, I can't.

31:04.488 --> 31:07.855
Why? What are you running from, Bo?

31:07.950 --> 31:10.362
One accident in your past, or yourself?

31:10.453 --> 31:12.739
I'm sorry, is Trick in
there or something?

31:12.830 --> 31:15.617
Because if we're doing this
whole body-switching thing again,

31:15.708 --> 31:17.494
I really have a lot on my plate, okay?

31:17.585 --> 31:21.373
So, can we just stick to Ferraro, please?

31:21.464 --> 31:23.876
Okay. What do you want to do?

31:23.966 --> 31:25.752
We have to shut the club down

31:25.843 --> 31:28.209
and get Mike out of there,
or he's a dead man.

31:28.304 --> 31:30.295
And that boy of his will be an orphan.

31:30.389 --> 31:33.677
Well, if Ferraro's not the frog,
he has to have one close by.

31:33.768 --> 31:36.510
So, who has access to Mike's drinks?

32:07.676 --> 32:10.383
Bo, you were right.

32:10.471 --> 32:13.588
The kid might be Fae. Look at this.

32:13.682 --> 32:14.467
He's ten, right?

32:14.558 --> 32:17.425
Well, eight years ago in Mike's
hometown, there was an accident.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.806
A Fae couple and their child.

32:19.897 --> 32:22.764
Car goes off the bridge
and both parents drown.

32:22.858 --> 32:25.019
The child was never found.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.897
Mike was a volunteer
firefighter at the scene.

32:26.987 --> 32:30.195
So, Mike finds the boy in the water
and brings him home to wifey?

32:30.282 --> 32:32.568
Who knows? Stranger things, right?

32:32.660 --> 32:33.695
Well, whatever the story is,

32:33.786 --> 32:36.152
we have to stop Mike from
getting in the ring tonight.

32:36.247 --> 32:38.659
And keep the boy from
killing his own father.

32:50.970 --> 32:53.757
Are you sure you should fight?

32:53.848 --> 32:55.554
You look sick.

32:57.685 --> 33:00.677
Hey, no worries, bud.

33:00.771 --> 33:04.605
Soon as | get out there,
the adrenaline takes over.

33:04.692 --> 33:07.308
Drink a lot of this, then.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.859
Yeah.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.087
[bell]

33:52.990 --> 33:54.446
Mike!

34:16.555 --> 34:19.718
It's going to be okay.
Just let him get through this.

34:19.808 --> 34:22.015
He's going to get hurt, Tyler.

34:22.102 --> 34:23.638
No, he's strong.

34:23.729 --> 34:27.642
Look, I know you're different.
l'm different too, Tyler.

34:29.318 --> 34:30.808
Look, I know you think
you're helping your dad,

34:30.903 --> 34:32.643
but you're actually making him sick.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.774
His body can't handle
what you're feeding it.

34:34.865 --> 34:38.323
And when he gets excited like
this, it's going to hurt him a lot.

34:40.079 --> 34:43.492
| only give him my sweat to make him
strong. So he'll stop getting hurt.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.868
When I was young,
I hurt someone really badly

34:45.960 --> 34:48.667
and | wish that I had had someone
there to help me understand.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.961
So, I am helping you understand.

34:51.048 --> 34:54.540
If your dad gets
angry again, he will die.

34:59.348 --> 35:01.179
Dad. Don't fight!

35:10.651 --> 35:12.516
Get up and fight!

35:14.154 --> 35:17.863
Get him! Get him! Get him!

35:20.953 --> 35:22.409
No!

35:23.706 --> 35:27.665
Get that kid out of here.
Get up. Do something.

35:27.751 --> 35:30.242
Tyler, get out of here. Let me do this.

35:30.337 --> 35:32.874
Dad, I poisoned you.

35:32.965 --> 35:34.876
If you keep fighting, you'll die.

35:34.967 --> 35:37.299
What are you talking about,
you poisoned me?

35:40.306 --> 35:45.266
[crowd reacting]

35:54.903 --> 35:56.439
I'm sorry, Dad.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.327
It's okay.

36:08.042 --> 36:09.498
It's okay.

36:12.129 --> 36:13.209
The fig ht's off.

36:13.297 --> 36:16.084
The fight's over when you go down.

36:16.175 --> 36:18.131
Get him!

36:18.218 --> 36:20.675
Get that kid out of here!

36:25.809 --> 36:28.221
You want to dance, pal? Huh?

36:28.312 --> 36:29.768
Let's grind.

36:42.201 --> 36:44.692
Hey, Ferraro, now the fight's over.

36:44.787 --> 36:46.948
You're a dead woman.

36:47.039 --> 36:48.495
[DYSON snarling]

36:58.634 --> 37:00.795
Hey.

37:00.886 --> 37:04.378
Don't worry, Tyler, everything's
going to be just fine.

37:04.473 --> 37:05.929
Okay.

37:09.603 --> 37:11.685
I'll explain everything.

37:22.658 --> 37:25.274
I'm sorry I was so mean to you.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.571
You weren't that bad.

37:30.666 --> 37:33.123
No, l was.

37:33.210 --> 37:35.667
You were just looking out for me, Kenz.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.166
You always do.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.623
--Yeah.
--Yeah.

37:42.511 --> 37:46.379
So, where are we going, Malibu? Hmm?

37:46.473 --> 37:48.759
Suck up some Vitamin D
with our pearly skin?

37:48.851 --> 37:53.390
We're not going anywhere, Kenz.
I'm done running.

37:53.480 --> 37:57.849
--Even better.
--I have to face who I am.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.559
No matter what the consequences.

38:00.654 --> 38:02.064
Bo.

38:02.156 --> 38:04.522
I'm telling Mel the truth.

38:11.123 --> 38:13.284
[DYSON] I found a Fae
boy raised by humans.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.117
It happens. Stick him in Child Services.

38:16.211 --> 38:19.044
The boy has already bonded
with his human father.

38:19.131 --> 38:21.622
So, now you're a social worker?

38:21.717 --> 38:25.426
Bo has the child and she won't give
him to you unless you claim the father.

38:25.512 --> 38:27.468
Bring them both into the fold.

38:27.556 --> 38:30.093
And you're going to stay away from
that underground fighting thing?

38:30.184 --> 38:32.095
Absolutely.

38:32.186 --> 38:36.020
However, if you reconsider your
position on Ferraro, you let me know.

38:37.858 --> 38:42.773
Oh yes, the big, bad Ferraro.

38:42.863 --> 38:44.603
I'll think about it.

38:44.698 --> 38:46.654
And the boy and his father?

38:46.742 --> 38:48.824
Did I say no?

38:57.878 --> 39:01.120
You deserve the truth
about everything.

39:01.215 --> 39:02.375
I already know the truth.

39:02.466 --> 39:04.081
You only think that you do.

39:04.176 --> 39:06.383
I loved Kyle.

39:06.470 --> 39:11.180
And I miss him so much and
lam so sorry for what I did.

39:11.266 --> 39:14.758
It's okay. The police
told me everything.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.684
What? What did they tell you?

39:16.772 --> 39:18.433
They think they know who killed Kyle.

39:18.524 --> 39:22.312
There was serial killer moving
through all the towns around us.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.529
He's never been caught.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.820
He used some kind of exotic poison.

39:26.907 --> 39:32.072
Poison? That's, um, that's surprising.

39:32.162 --> 39:35.825
Detective Hale says they're going
to retest tissue samples from Kyle.

39:35.916 --> 39:37.827
Detective Hale?

39:37.918 --> 39:41.285
I know he's your handler. He told me.

39:41.380 --> 39:45.089
The killer saw you and you ran.
What an ordeal it must have been.

39:45.175 --> 39:46.551
Being in witness protection,

39:46.635 --> 39:49.502
having to look over your
shoulder all these years.

39:49.596 --> 39:53.885
I'm so, so sorry for everything.

39:53.976 --> 39:55.932
I'll keep your secret, Beth.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.223
|'|| protect you.

40:13.954 --> 40:15.410
Hale!

40:17.040 --> 40:19.156
You lied for me without my permission.

40:19.251 --> 40:20.661
That is so not cool.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.243
That's why he refused to do it.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.875
I talked him into it.

40:25.966 --> 40:27.456
--You?
--For an old-timer,

40:27.551 --> 40:29.007
I still got pull around these parts.

40:29.094 --> 40:33.554
Ah, I'm gonna give
you two some privacy.

40:33.640 --> 40:37.303
That wasn't your call.
Mel's family deserves the truth.

40:37.394 --> 40:39.806
And the Fae deserve to remain hidden.

40:39.896 --> 40:41.727
Who decides which
is the greater good, you?

40:41.815 --> 40:44.773
I didn't choose to be Fae, but I can
choose to do the right thing

40:44.860 --> 40:47.977
and telling that dead boy's family
the truth, that is what's right.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.778
You still don't appreciate
how cruel this world is

40:50.866 --> 40:52.652
and how tenuous our place in it.

40:52.743 --> 40:56.110
You still don't think of
yourself as one of us, do you?

40:58.582 --> 41:00.573
You have a place with us.

41:00.667 --> 41:04.330
And if you embrace it, think of
how much good you'll be able to do.

41:04.421 --> 41:06.787
I doubt that.

41:06.882 --> 41:09.248
The Nain Rouge appeared to you.

41:09.343 --> 41:12.210
She warned you about
this approaching disaster.

41:12.304 --> 41:13.885
What if that's not it at all?

41:13.972 --> 41:16.429
What if this thing is
coming for me to use me?

41:16.516 --> 41:18.802
What if I am the monster?

41:18.894 --> 41:20.304
Why on earth would you think that?

41:20.395 --> 41:24.183
Because the Nain Rouge
gave me a vision.

41:25.484 --> 41:30.695
l was standing over your body
and l was the one that killed you.

41:32.532 --> 41:38.277
Please, you can't put
any stock in visions.

41:38.372 --> 41:43.867
Whatever you think you saw,
it means something different.

41:43.960 --> 41:48.829
Now what can I get ya? Beer? Scotch?

41:48.924 --> 41:51.711
A five-day bubble bath
and a time machine.

42:05.399 --> 42:07.765
Thrasher, what the hell are you doing?

42:14.533 --> 42:18.401
Dear Thrasher has been
keeping an eye on you for me.

42:24.334 --> 42:26.871
She's Fae.

42:26.962 --> 42:29.294
Subtle, isn't she?

42:34.428 --> 42:40.719
So, yes, I know all about the little
brouhaha last night at the fight.

42:40.809 --> 42:43.391
Fae fighting humans
for the world wide web.

42:43.478 --> 42:45.389
Frog boys revealing themselves.

42:45.480 --> 42:49.393
What are we going to do with you?

42:49.484 --> 42:51.975
It's not my fault.

42:52.070 --> 42:54.777
Is it not?

42:54.865 --> 42:57.322
I haven't been feeling
like myself lately.

42:57.409 --> 43:00.776
Oh, do tell.

43:00.871 --> 43:02.987
It's been dark.

43:03.081 --> 43:10.249
Real dark, like there's a storm inside me
feeding off the rage of the fighters.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.954
I need help!

43:14.843 --> 43:19.428
Have you told anybody else
about these dark appetites?

43:25.395 --> 43:27.351
Well, that's good.
