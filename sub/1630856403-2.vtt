14:46.668 --> 14:49.149
I must've
done it wrong.

You did it
perfectly, mum.

The Moot witnessed it,

14:57.940 --> 14:59.507

They grew up together.

make sense of it.

15:20.136 --> 15:23.313
Of course you do.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.708
But the most likely
explanation

15:26.708 --> 15:28.188
is an accident.

I'm sorry,
I'm overwrought.

Just to be clear,
Harper is not a witch.

16:57.886 --> 17:00.323
I understood the gift
was inherited.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.196
No, my grandmother was a witch,

my daughter is not,

she's been certified as

I'd prefer to show it

I'll tell her you'd like

28:46.725 --> 28:48.248
very different people.

28:57.170 --> 29:00.869
So, the footage that was
screened at the party,

29:00.913 --> 29:02.653
we're currently
trying to establish

29:02.697 --> 29:06.701
who was responsible for
causing it to be... shared.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.921
But if that person
was Daniel...

29:08.964 --> 29:13.099
Then I might be
a bit pissed off,

29:13.142 --> 29:14.578
and there's your
motive for murder?

29:14.622 --> 29:16.015
Which we've already
established

29:16.058 --> 29:17.625
can't be attributed
to Harper.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.282
Unless witchcraft
was used.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.459
[muffled audio on phone]

29:31.160 --> 29:32.596
Um, I'm sorry, that...

29:34.729 --> 29:36.078
Are you kidding me?

29:36.122 --> 29:37.776
Is that supposed to me
casting a spell?

29:40.517 --> 29:42.519
What does it
look like to you?

29:42.519 --> 29:46.306
It looks like a young woman,
understandably livid

29:46.349 --> 29:48.699
because her ex-boyfriend
thought it would be fun

29:48.743 --> 29:53.443
to show a private, intimate act
to his mates at a party.

29:53.487 --> 29:54.793
Those hand movements--

29:54.836 --> 29:56.664
She's angry.

29:56.707 --> 29:59.928
Correction, she's absolutely
fucking furious.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.147
And wouldn't you be?

30:03.453 --> 30:04.672
[sighs]

30:07.544 --> 30:09.111
[phone ringing]

30:12.506 --> 30:14.203
Ryan?

30:14.290 --> 30:15.509
RYAN [on phone]:
You need to get to the station.

30:15.596 --> 30:16.727
Forensics found something.

30:16.771 --> 30:17.946
Okay, on my way.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.040
Thank you for this.

30:25.084 --> 30:27.651
I just wanted you to see
how loved he was.

30:27.695 --> 30:31.612
Yes, all very affecting.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.397
I just think sometimes,
when people hide their grief,

30:34.441 --> 30:36.660
it can look like
they don't care,

30:36.704 --> 30:38.706
and no one wants
to give that impression.

30:40.882 --> 30:43.363
No, indeed that would
not be a good look.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.541
Mr. Whithall,
Mrs. Whithall.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.717
I'm so sorry about Dan.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.414
Thank you.

30:51.414 --> 30:53.068
And all this awful
gossip going around.

30:53.068 --> 30:54.983
Gossip?

30:55.027 --> 30:58.291
I know you think magic
is only ever used for good,

30:58.334 --> 31:00.728
but if half of what people
are saying is true...

31:11.478 --> 31:13.915
What are they saying?

31:13.959 --> 31:15.699
That Harper caused
Dan's death.

31:15.743 --> 31:16.831
What?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.528
ABIGAIL:
By witchcraft?

31:18.572 --> 31:20.487
Could the rumors be true?

31:20.574 --> 31:22.576
MICHAEL: It sounds extreme,
but it would explain a lot.

31:44.337 --> 31:45.468
BRIDGET [on phone]:
Hello?

31:45.512 --> 31:46.992
Hi, Bridge,

31:47.035 --> 31:48.167
could you and Julia
come round later?

31:48.210 --> 31:50.560
Of course...
and Sarah?

31:50.604 --> 31:52.606
No, just you and Julia.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.262
Okay, bye.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.568
Bye.

31:58.655 --> 32:01.049
Harper's not a witch,
the failed rite proves that--

32:01.093 --> 32:02.659
Not in court.

32:02.703 --> 32:05.097
Magical evidence
can't be used as a defense,

32:05.184 --> 32:06.707
and if she's
found guilty...

32:11.407 --> 32:14.584
Note 15, "Exemption to repeal
of capital punishment."

32:14.628 --> 32:16.151
There is no exemption.

32:16.195 --> 32:18.240
The death penalty
was abolished years ago.

32:18.284 --> 32:22.201
With one exception-- 1647,
thanks to Matthew Hopkins,

32:22.201 --> 32:23.724
magic gets outlawed,

32:23.767 --> 32:25.247
but even after he retires,

32:25.291 --> 32:28.816
the law considers magic
such a threat to...

32:28.859 --> 32:32.167
"...the moral and spiritual
well-being of this country

32:32.211 --> 32:33.386
that it grants..."

32:36.128 --> 32:38.478
"Exemption in perpetuity
from any future amendments

32:38.521 --> 32:41.002
relating to capital
criminal witchcraft."

32:41.089 --> 32:43.178
So for murder
by unnatural means...

32:43.265 --> 32:45.615
The death penalty
still stands.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.182
You're fucking joking.

32:47.226 --> 32:49.271
Which means
if it goes to court

32:49.315 --> 32:51.143
and a jury believes
she's guilty...

32:53.014 --> 32:54.755
Jesus.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.713
I didn't tell Harper.

32:56.757 --> 32:59.368
She doesn't
need to know but I--

32:59.368 --> 33:02.067
if it's true that
Daniel was murdered--

33:02.110 --> 33:04.373
though God knows why
anyone would want to--

33:04.460 --> 33:06.636
I have to prove
she wasn't involved.

33:06.767 --> 33:09.074
How?

33:09.074 --> 33:11.815
I went to the grave.

33:11.859 --> 33:13.034
Why?To see if I could

33:13.078 --> 33:14.470
pick anything up.

33:14.514 --> 33:16.603
But no magic?

33:16.603 --> 33:18.126
Not that I could tell.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.780
Well, then we--There is...

33:19.780 --> 33:21.347
one thing I could do.

33:23.218 --> 33:26.569
Divination--
one of the most difficult spells

33:26.613 --> 33:28.180
a witch can assay.

33:30.138 --> 33:33.098
For this, we choose
white carnations,

33:33.141 --> 33:36.101
bittersweet and
purple-headed aconite.

33:38.973 --> 33:42.890
Take your scrying bowl and wipe
it clean with mugwort oil.

33:42.933 --> 33:45.762
Cleanse it in the smoke of
cedar wood,

33:45.849 --> 33:47.460
salvia divinorum,

33:47.547 --> 33:51.464
the most powerful
of the sacred sages

33:51.507 --> 33:53.553
to shield and protect
the scryer.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.600
SERAFINA:
Divination requires a question,

33:57.687 --> 34:01.213
posed by the witch,
answered by the ritual.

34:01.256 --> 34:04.390
If the question is too vague,
the answer will not come.

34:05.826 --> 34:08.655
How did Daniel die?

34:08.697 --> 34:11.310
Was Daniel's death
an accident?

34:11.353 --> 34:12.789
SERAFINA:
The old wisdom holds

34:12.876 --> 34:15.226
that there's always
an answer,

34:15.226 --> 34:18.969
though we may not be capable
of understanding it.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.188
Sacred oil to cleanse
perceptions

34:21.233 --> 34:23.364
so it shows no lies.

34:23.364 --> 34:25.498
Then, the salvia.

34:32.373 --> 34:33.940
Choose the sigils.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.781
Finally, the question.

34:47.824 --> 34:50.175
Who killed Daniel Whithall
at the warehouse?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.264
[rumbling]

35:05.712 --> 35:06.974
[Sarah gasps]

35:20.857 --> 35:22.990
[glass shattering]

35:27.386 --> 35:29.127
[whistle blows,
kids shouting and playing]

35:32.391 --> 35:34.044
I'm sure there's a reason
this can't wait

35:34.044 --> 35:36.395
till after school,
because I don't enjoy

35:36.438 --> 35:39.746
pulling students out of class,
disrupting their studies.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.315
MAGGIE: Jake, can I
read you some messages

35:43.358 --> 35:45.273
we found on your phone?

35:45.273 --> 35:47.449
We need to understand
what's going on here.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.712
What?

35:49.756 --> 35:51.279
No, you-- that's private,
you've got no right.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.716
Dan, "Fuck that was cringe."

35:53.760 --> 35:56.197
You, "It's how I feel."

35:56.197 --> 35:58.460
Dan, "I don't feel
the same."

35:58.504 --> 36:01.855
You, "Please don't
tell anyone."

36:01.855 --> 36:04.597
Dan, "Okay, but you
need to stop."

36:04.640 --> 36:06.294
You,
"Forget I said it."

36:06.294 --> 36:09.428
Dan, "I wish."

36:09.471 --> 36:11.299
Was that really necessary?

36:11.343 --> 36:12.518
MAGGIE:
I believe so, yes.

36:14.955 --> 36:17.131
So were you angry with Dan

36:17.175 --> 36:20.439
for not returning
your feelings?

36:20.482 --> 36:24.138
So angry
you wanted to hurt him?

36:24.182 --> 36:26.227
[nervously] No.Or get someone else to?

36:26.271 --> 36:27.663
No, never.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.536
Why are you saying this?

36:33.800 --> 36:36.324
It's all Harper.

36:36.324 --> 36:38.413
She's the one.

36:38.457 --> 36:40.720
She never understood him.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.809
She never got how

36:42.852 --> 36:45.203
amazing he was, she just...

36:48.249 --> 36:50.033
...wasted him.

36:50.077 --> 36:52.558
PRINCIPAL:
Okay, that's enough questions.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.388
[tearfully]
Don't tell my dad.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.000
Sure.

37:05.484 --> 37:07.660
[school bell ringing]RYAN: So is he a suspect?

37:07.703 --> 37:09.357
MAGGIE: Everyone's a suspect
till we've ruled them out,

37:09.401 --> 37:11.141
and it still might be
an accident.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.708
RYAN:
You saw the toxicology report.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.144
MAGGIE: Hmm, no drugs,

37:14.188 --> 37:16.843
barely any alcohol, yeah.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.845
A drunken stumble,
break's neck theory

37:18.932 --> 37:21.978
looks unlikely, but one thing
we can rule out is magic,

37:21.978 --> 37:24.807
if we bring in an MI,
Magical Investigator.

37:24.851 --> 37:26.722
"MI,"
that's actually a thing?

37:26.722 --> 37:29.116
It is, yes, though evidence
derived by unnatural means

37:29.159 --> 37:30.944
is inadmissible in court,

37:30.944 --> 37:32.815
but once we find out
if magic was used,

37:32.815 --> 37:35.775
we can rule Harper out,or in.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.257
I know it's not what
any of us wanted to hear,

37:39.257 --> 37:41.998
but that's the evidence.

37:41.998 --> 37:43.783
So I have to know
that you'll be there for me,

37:43.783 --> 37:45.088
whatever I need to do.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.749
You've been doing
really well, Abbie.

37:53.793 --> 37:56.926
The way you've held it all
together, it's incredible.

37:56.926 --> 37:59.886
But grief can make you imagine
all kinds of crazy stuff.

37:59.886 --> 38:01.888
What am I imagining?

38:01.888 --> 38:03.759
There's a video.

38:03.759 --> 38:06.458
Of Harper waving her
hands about looking angry--

38:06.458 --> 38:07.807
that could mean anything.

38:07.894 --> 38:10.940
And she's not a witch,
we all know that.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.986
Do we?

38:12.986 --> 38:15.728
We've been told it but...

38:15.728 --> 38:17.904
But if Sarah wanted
to keep it from us?

38:17.904 --> 38:19.906
Why would she do that?

38:19.906 --> 38:22.169
You've known each other
since your kids were born,

38:22.212 --> 38:24.693
is it likely she'd hide
something like that from you?

38:24.693 --> 38:27.653
I never would've
thought so once but...

38:27.696 --> 38:29.959
But my son is dead,
and I need to make sense

38:29.959 --> 38:32.919
of what happened to him.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.747
And we all know Sarah
can be secretive.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.575
She keeps confidences, yes.

38:36.575 --> 38:38.403
And we know she's been
willing to bend the rules

38:38.446 --> 38:40.709
when it suits her.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.624
I bet she's done loads of stuff
for every one of us

38:42.711 --> 38:44.757
that no one else knows about.

38:46.759 --> 38:48.587
What sort of stuff?

38:51.894 --> 38:54.244
ABIGAIL:
Michael got passed over again.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.421
Of course he did--
he looks the part,

38:56.464 --> 38:59.989
he's smart but he's lazy,
he only does the bare minimum.

39:00.076 --> 39:02.818
And we have debts--
the house,

39:02.818 --> 39:05.778
cars, gym, golf club.

39:08.128 --> 39:10.086
And we're living way
beyond our means and,

39:10.173 --> 39:13.699
and if Michael doesn't
get this promotion, Sarah...

39:15.744 --> 39:18.747
We will lose everything.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.880
Please help me.[softly] Come.

39:22.490 --> 39:23.665
Help Michael.

39:27.408 --> 39:29.105
JULIA: I don't know
about anyone else,

39:29.192 --> 39:29.889
but I, for one,
admit I owe Sarah,

39:29.932 --> 39:32.848
I think we all do,

39:32.892 --> 39:34.197
which is why I don't think
it's very fair

39:34.241 --> 39:36.069
to ask us to take sides.

39:36.069 --> 39:38.941
You're not
thinking straight, Abbie,

39:38.941 --> 39:41.422
you're distraught.We all are.

39:41.466 --> 39:44.425
Don't turn on Sarah,
turn to her,

39:44.469 --> 39:46.122
she can help you.

39:46.122 --> 39:48.864
There's nothing
she wouldn't do for you.

39:48.864 --> 39:51.389
You of all people
know that.

39:58.961 --> 40:00.920
When you said
slight accident...

40:03.357 --> 40:05.272
I may have downplayed it.

40:05.315 --> 40:06.795
What happened?
What did you find?

40:06.882 --> 40:08.101
Nothing.

40:09.842 --> 40:13.323
The spell
showed me nothing.

40:13.323 --> 40:14.890
Maybe I made an error
in the ritual.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.501
Is that likely?

40:16.544 --> 40:20.940
I don't know, I was upset,

40:20.940 --> 40:22.942
I kept thinking
of Dan as he was--

40:22.942 --> 40:25.423
of all of them, actually.

40:26.989 --> 40:29.514
Pierre...

40:29.557 --> 40:32.212
Do you ever wonder if the girls
saw anything that day?

40:32.212 --> 40:34.170
I know Bridge
hates to talk about it,

40:34.214 --> 40:37.391
but they all
used to be so close.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.395
Yeah.
I've thought about it,

40:41.439 --> 40:44.746
and in the end I reckoned you
could read too much into it.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.661
Kids grow up,

40:46.748 --> 40:48.358
grow apart,

40:48.358 --> 40:52.188
Dan got scouted,
the girls got into boys,

40:52.232 --> 40:53.581
Izzy got into onesies.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.455
But with Dan...

40:59.065 --> 41:00.806
It bothers me

41:00.893 --> 41:03.722
that day he didn't
give his consent.

41:03.765 --> 41:04.984
But you know
he would have.

41:05.027 --> 41:07.290
But I don't know that.

41:07.290 --> 41:10.598
And now I'm thinking,

41:10.642 --> 41:12.644
is this some
kind of payback?

41:12.644 --> 41:16.212
My daughter accused of murder
by unnatural means.

41:16.212 --> 41:20.390
Right now there's no proof
magic was used at all.

41:20.434 --> 41:21.740
You don't even
have proof.

41:23.263 --> 41:26.222
[SIGHS]
The warehouse.

41:26.222 --> 41:28.311
What?There was nothing at the grave,

41:28.355 --> 41:31.924
but if magic was used
at the warehouse,

41:32.011 --> 41:33.491
there'll be traces.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.146
I need to go there.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.540
Uh, okay, okay.

41:39.584 --> 41:42.195
But not today,
girl, hmm?

41:42.195 --> 41:45.981
What you need...
is sleep, hmm?

41:55.600 --> 41:57.515
[phone buzzing]

41:59.908 --> 42:01.649
Hello?RYAN [on phone]: So I called

42:01.649 --> 42:03.433
the Moot and asked them
to recommend an MI.

42:03.477 --> 42:04.826
Check your email.

42:09.352 --> 42:12.442
Morgan Lynch,
Senior Magical Investigator,

42:12.530 --> 42:14.662
very experienced
and an expert at identifying

42:14.706 --> 42:17.230
the presence of magic
at crime scenes.

42:17.273 --> 42:18.405
MAGGIE: Oh, great.

42:38.077 --> 42:40.775
I know it's been
a long day, but...

42:40.819 --> 42:42.777
I need to talk.

42:42.864 --> 42:44.213
Of course.

42:44.257 --> 42:45.519
Come in.

42:50.219 --> 42:52.308
So I've decided to go to the
warehouse.

42:52.352 --> 42:56.051
If I can prove that magic wasn't
used, it'll put a stop

42:56.095 --> 42:58.880
to all the nonsense
about Harper.

42:58.924 --> 43:01.317
Shall I make some tea?
Chamomile?

43:01.317 --> 43:03.711
I didn't come for tea, Sarah,
I came for Daniel.

43:06.453 --> 43:07.759
I want him back.

43:11.632 --> 43:13.329
You know I don't do
seances, Abbie.

43:13.329 --> 43:15.593
I'm not asking
for a seance, Sarah,

43:15.636 --> 43:19.466
I said, I want him back.

43:22.904 --> 43:24.123
That's not possible.

43:25.907 --> 43:28.910
Why not?
You did it before.

43:31.957 --> 43:33.306
[gasps]

43:35.438 --> 43:37.702
No, Abbie,
that was different.

43:37.702 --> 43:40.748
This time...

43:40.792 --> 43:44.230
If it was a question of calling
him back at the threshold, uh,

43:44.317 --> 43:45.884
I don't know.

43:45.884 --> 43:51.019
I would try-- for you,
I'd try anything.

43:51.019 --> 43:53.543
But he's been dead
too long,

43:53.587 --> 43:55.633
his body's in the ground,
there's nothing I can do.

43:55.676 --> 43:57.286
There has to be, Sarah,

43:57.330 --> 43:59.027
because my life has
no meaning without him,

43:59.071 --> 44:00.681
and if you don't
bring him back--

44:00.725 --> 44:02.378
I'm telling you,I can't.

44:02.422 --> 44:03.728
Well, you need to find a way

44:03.771 --> 44:05.381
because otherwise
Harper will go on trial

44:05.468 --> 44:06.731
and Jake will testify.

44:08.950 --> 44:09.951
What are you saying?

44:09.951 --> 44:11.474
Bring Dan back

44:11.518 --> 44:14.434
and I'll get Jake
to withdraw his statement.

44:17.916 --> 44:20.527
How would you
even explain it?

44:20.570 --> 44:22.964
A boy, raised
from the dead.

44:25.227 --> 44:28.230
I wouldn't explain it,
I would...

44:28.274 --> 44:30.493
I would just go somewhere,

44:30.537 --> 44:32.104
disappear with Dan,
start a new life.

44:32.104 --> 44:34.541
That, that's insane.

44:34.584 --> 44:37.022
No, Sarah, insane is me
just giving up on him!

44:39.589 --> 44:41.983

for something gained.
