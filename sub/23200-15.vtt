00:31.648 --> 00:33.358
Don't think about it.

00:33.442 --> 00:36.862
We have to think about it.
Henry, what are we going to do?

00:38.363 --> 00:40.115
I want to get married.

00:40.198 --> 00:42.367
So do I. More than anything.

00:42.868 --> 00:46.455
Look, our parents hate each other,
and we're the ones who suffer.

00:46.538 --> 00:48.332
We've got to elope.

00:48.415 --> 00:50.292
Hon, we've been through that.

00:50.709 --> 00:54.254
If I ran off with you, my folks
would cut me off without a penny.

00:54.546 --> 00:57.174
No money, no journalism school.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.593
No journalism school, no future.

01:01.553 --> 01:04.306
Of course, I was thinking...

01:04.388 --> 01:07.851
that if we did elope,
and then we sold this car of yours-

01:07.934 --> 01:09.144
Are you kidding?

01:09.227 --> 01:12.063
If I ran away with you, my folks
would have it repossessed...

01:12.147 --> 01:16.067
faster than we could get it out
of the garage.

01:16.151 --> 01:17.986
What're we going to do?

01:22.198 --> 01:23.867
My gosh!

01:31.207 --> 01:32.333
What is it?

01:32.417 --> 01:35.253
It's a UFO,
just like the one Jake saw last night!

01:38.256 --> 01:40.758
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to get a picture.

01:40.842 --> 01:42.427
No, Henry. Stay here.

01:42.510 --> 01:45.221
Are you nuts?
This is the chance of a lifetime.

01:47.390 --> 01:49.893
No, Henry.

01:51.561 --> 01:53.354
Where are you going?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.751
Please come back.

03:49.970 --> 03:54.641
Terror and tragedy seem quite out of place
in the small, quiet town of Berryville.

03:54.725 --> 03:59.229
Yet for the past week, strange light
formations have violated its night skies.

03:59.521 --> 04:02.733
More UFOs have been sighted here
in the last five days...

04:02.816 --> 04:05.569
than were sighted in the whole country
this past year.

04:05.652 --> 04:09.489
But last night the terror here in Berryville
reached new dimensions...

04:09.573 --> 04:11.783
when one of its citizens, Henry Wilson...

04:11.867 --> 04:15.537
inexplicably, and perhaps tragically,
disappeared.

04:30.802 --> 04:32.095
Excuse me.

04:32.721 --> 04:35.140
- Mrs. Wilson?
- Yes?

04:35.473 --> 04:37.726
I'm Diana Prince with the IADC.

04:37.892 --> 04:40.895
I know you're upset,
but I'd like to ask you a few questions.

04:40.979 --> 04:43.440
- Is that all right?
- I suppose.

04:43.523 --> 04:45.400
Mrs. Wilson, a few words with you, please.

04:45.483 --> 04:47.944
It was your son who disappeared...

04:48.027 --> 04:49.070
Are we rolling?

04:49.154 --> 04:53.324
It was your son who disappeared
in those UFO sightings last night?

04:54.242 --> 04:55.285
Yes.

04:55.368 --> 04:58.621
Could you speak just a bit louder
for our cameras, please?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.124
Yes, it was my son Henry.

05:02.542 --> 05:06.838
What makes you assume he was abducted
by creatures from outer space?

05:07.422 --> 05:09.924
Henry said he was going to the library.

05:10.008 --> 05:14.429
He's a student at State, you know.
He studies so hard.

05:16.597 --> 05:20.268
I know it's very painful, Mrs. Wilson,
but please go on.

05:21.018 --> 05:24.147
Henry always walked to the library...

05:24.438 --> 05:28.192
in fact, he walked almost everywhere,
especially at night.

05:28.776 --> 05:31.529
But what makes you so sure
he was abducted?

05:31.737 --> 05:36.325
Because to get to the library
he'd have to pass by that field...

05:36.742 --> 05:41.330
where our neighbor, Jake,
saw one of those things the night before.

05:43.541 --> 05:48.379
It's like Henry was just picked up and
whisked away by some awful creature.

05:49.338 --> 05:51.590
But what of the fact
that your son Henry...

05:51.674 --> 05:54.885
may be the world's
first intergalactic space traveler?

05:54.969 --> 05:58.431
Isn't that some solace to you,
Mrs. Wilson?

05:58.639 --> 06:01.475
Would you hold the picture
to our cameras, please?

06:05.479 --> 06:07.398
I just want him back.

06:08.983 --> 06:13.445
He belongs here in Berryville,
not out there.

06:24.081 --> 06:26.125
Did you say you were
with the government?

06:26.208 --> 06:29.670
Yes, the IADC. I'm trying to find out
about those sightings.

06:29.753 --> 06:32.506
I've been hoping an outsider like you
would show up.

06:32.589 --> 06:33.715
Why?

06:33.799 --> 06:36.385
What I know
I can't say to anybody in town.

06:36.468 --> 06:39.513
- About this abduction nonsense?
- It isn't nonsense.

06:39.763 --> 06:42.266
Henry really was captured by a UFO.

06:42.808 --> 06:44.059
I have proof.

06:44.142 --> 06:47.062
If anyone in town ever found out
I had Henry in my car last night...

06:47.145 --> 06:50.857
I'd never be let out of the house again.
That's why I have to keep this a secret.

06:50.941 --> 06:52.317
Tape recorder?

06:52.401 --> 06:55.696
Henry's a journalism student.
He and his equipment are inseparable.

06:55.779 --> 06:58.490
He says he always wants to be ready
for the big story.

06:58.573 --> 07:02.411
You mean, he had this with him when
he was carried off by the UFO you saw?

07:02.494 --> 07:04.788
He must have dropped it. Play it.

07:08.041 --> 07:11.503
The object in front ofme
is about 14 feet by 20...

07:12.212 --> 07:15.841
made of a metallic substance similar to...

07:17.092 --> 07:19.052
Well, it looks like silver rubber.

07:19.135 --> 07:22.180
It's oblong and ringed
with blinding red and white lights.

07:22.264 --> 07:24.558
And now... wait!

07:25.058 --> 07:27.310
Something's coming out of the bottom.

07:28.228 --> 07:29.604
Yes. Beings!

07:30.063 --> 07:32.315
Beings from another planet.

07:34.484 --> 07:36.736
They're small, about 5'4 ".

07:37.737 --> 07:39.989
Grayish, with no features.

07:41.074 --> 07:42.826
They're coming closer.

07:44.202 --> 07:45.495
It's okay.

07:48.123 --> 07:50.542
You see? They really did take him.

07:51.251 --> 07:54.963
Attention. Emergency alert in progress.
Please clear the streets.

07:55.421 --> 07:58.550
- Where outside Berryville?
- I don't know.

07:58.842 --> 08:00.969
Quit picking your toes and find out!

08:01.052 --> 08:02.470
I'm in Berryville right now...

08:02.554 --> 08:04.973
in case you imbeciles back there
have forgotten.

08:05.056 --> 08:06.766
Excuse me. What's going on here?

08:06.849 --> 08:09.310
We're being attacked
by a fleet of starships, that's all.

08:09.394 --> 08:11.145
It's the biggest news story
since the Flood.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.189
- What?
- You don't have a television?

08:13.272 --> 08:16.442
There's a battle going on
between us and aliens from outer space...

08:16.526 --> 08:18.695
somewhere in these hills,
and we're losing.

08:18.778 --> 08:20.905
And we're just sitting here. Come on, Mac.

08:20.988 --> 08:23.658
- How about showing me where a phone is?
- Okay. Come on.

08:23.741 --> 08:25.952
You're not part of a news team, are you?

08:53.979 --> 08:56.440
- When did it start?
- About 10 minutes ago.

08:56.524 --> 08:59.777
First it was only on CBS,
but now all the networks have a feed.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.363
They're convinced it's for real, Colonel.

09:02.446 --> 09:04.198
I've never seen anything like it.

09:04.281 --> 09:07.660
These starships are annihilating
everything in their path.

09:10.204 --> 09:12.456
Nothing can defeat their lasers.

09:13.874 --> 09:17.127
The Lord help us all.
I don't think anything can stop them.

09:28.555 --> 09:31.350
Y eah. Not now. Hold all my calls.

09:38.524 --> 09:40.776
This small group of farmers and deputies...

09:40.859 --> 09:43.237
Who are making a courageous stand
in this field...

09:43.320 --> 09:47.491
are certainly no match
for the incredibly devastating weaponry...

09:47.574 --> 09:50.410
that is being displayed
by this group of aliens.

10:03.715 --> 10:07.719
All right. We're all on red alert
until somebody gets to the bottom of this.

10:07.803 --> 10:09.513
Above all, stay calm.

10:09.596 --> 10:11.932
All we know
is what we've seen on television.

10:12.015 --> 10:15.977
It's probably some kind of a hoax,
or a colossal mistake.

10:16.353 --> 10:20.107
At any rate, we all have our jobs to do,
so let's do them.

10:21.983 --> 10:23.109
Bobbie...

10:23.944 --> 10:26.696
I want you to contact the media,
especially television...

10:26.780 --> 10:29.866
tell them to bottle this thing up.
We don't want mass hysteria.

10:29.950 --> 10:32.077
If they ask for a statement, simply say:

10:32.160 --> 10:34.246
"The government
does not confirm any of it. "

10:34.329 --> 10:36.706
- Right, Colonel.
- Bobbie, one more thing...

10:37.082 --> 10:40.835
I want you to find the television feed
that the networks have been picking up.

10:40.919 --> 10:42.295
Already have, Colonel.

10:42.379 --> 10:46.591
Apparently an unlicensed pirate station
in Pennsylvania is relaying the broadcast.

10:46.675 --> 10:49.302
- Where in Pennsylvania?
- Just outside Berryville...

10:49.386 --> 10:50.929
where you sent Diana.

10:57.685 --> 11:00.605
The broadcast stopped abruptly
about 10 minutes ago...

11:00.688 --> 11:02.565
but according to our satellite sensors...

11:02.649 --> 11:05.652
the feed originated
at an unlicensed transmitter...

11:05.735 --> 11:07.946
about 9 miles West of Berryville.

11:08.613 --> 11:11.658
I want to hear back from you
in exactly one hour.

11:11.741 --> 11:13.409
Is that understood?

11:13.493 --> 11:14.827
Okay. Goodbye.

11:16.371 --> 11:19.916
Diana's trying to locate the people
who were broadcasting that battle.

11:19.999 --> 11:23.795
She also said to be on the lookout
for a tape she'd messengered over here.

11:23.878 --> 11:26.172
She wants the lab boys
to test its authenticity.

11:26.255 --> 11:29.467
Will do. Meanwhile, there's about
10 zillion people to see you...

11:29.550 --> 11:31.427
about this invasion...

11:31.511 --> 11:34.555
one of whom is a UFO man,
Col. Robert Elliot.

11:35.139 --> 11:37.350
- Good.
- No, I'll get him.

11:37.433 --> 11:40.728
There's likely to be a riot
if you poke your head out there.

11:44.690 --> 11:47.109
Col. Elliot, he'll see you now.

11:49.528 --> 11:51.864
- Long time, Colonel.
- It's nice to see you.

11:51.948 --> 11:56.827
As the airforce's leading expert on UFO's,
do you have any theories?

11:58.204 --> 12:00.414
All I can say is I'm on my way
to the airport...

12:00.498 --> 12:02.333
then to Pittsburgh, and on to Berryville...

12:02.416 --> 12:04.502
for a firsthand look
at what we're up against.

12:04.585 --> 12:08.172
Sorry to hear that. I was hoping you
were in on this thing to prove it a hoax.

12:08.255 --> 12:09.548
I'm afraid not.

12:09.632 --> 12:12.635
One of our pilots has spotted
what looks like the battle site...

12:12.718 --> 12:14.637
in the foothills of the Alleghenies.

12:14.720 --> 12:18.390
That is a fact which, I trust,
will go no further than this office.

12:18.474 --> 12:21.435
Of course.
You mean there really is an invasion?

12:21.518 --> 12:24.939
Well, again, all I can say is
we're facing a situation here...

12:25.022 --> 12:28.108
that warrants swift
and careful investigation.

12:28.192 --> 12:30.736
Can't the authorities in Pennsylvania
handle it?

12:30.819 --> 12:33.864
We haven't been able to reach
any of our people there.

12:33.947 --> 12:35.449
The matter is much too delicate...

12:35.532 --> 12:37.618
to enlist the state's
law enforcement agencies.

12:37.701 --> 12:40.329
We can't risk panicking the public
any further.

12:40.412 --> 12:42.623
I'm sorry to blindside you like this,
Colonel...

12:42.706 --> 12:44.917
but I couldn't discuss it with you
on the phone.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.168
I understand.

12:46.251 --> 12:48.921
But let me ask you,
are you being sent to Berryville...

12:49.004 --> 12:51.840
because of your past work
with Project Blue Book...

12:51.924 --> 12:55.928
or because of your present involvement
with our nuclear weapons program?

12:56.011 --> 12:57.346
Let me put it this way.

12:57.429 --> 13:00.182
My superiors felt
that not only was I the best person...

13:00.265 --> 13:02.392
to figure out what we're up against...

13:02.476 --> 13:06.813
but they also felt I was the best person
to figure out how to eliminate it.

13:08.857 --> 13:10.609
I have to go, Colonel.

13:10.692 --> 13:13.153
I just got word
that someone in Berryville...

13:13.236 --> 13:16.114
was apparently abducted last night
by a UFO.

13:16.198 --> 13:18.366
I didn't give it much credence until now.

13:18.450 --> 13:20.160
How did you come by that information?

13:20.243 --> 13:23.872
I sent an agent to see
if there was anything to the sightings.

15:42.760 --> 15:46.346
My Lord, they wiped out
every last one of them.

15:47.264 --> 15:51.518
A handful of defenseless farmers,
county deputies...

15:52.519 --> 15:54.021
destroyed like paper dolls.

15:54.104 --> 15:56.106
Not necessarily, General.

15:56.315 --> 15:58.817
- What are you talking about?
- The TV crew.

15:59.610 --> 16:02.196
Whoever recorded the battle is not here.

16:03.113 --> 16:05.824
Looks as if they, and only they,
got out alive.

16:08.243 --> 16:12.706
Almost as if those monsters wanted
to make sure the whole world saw this.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.461
This is what I suggest we do, General:

16:17.753 --> 16:21.715
We cordon off an area on the other side
of that ridge to decoy the public.

16:21.798 --> 16:25.260
It'll give us a chance to take soil samples
and test for radioactivity...

16:25.343 --> 16:26.845
without causing panic.

16:26.928 --> 16:29.639
And above all,
we have to locate that TV crew.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.810
- They're the only true witnesses we have.
- Fine, Elliot.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.981
We'll lead the public
to believe the whole thing a hoax...

16:38.064 --> 16:40.859
until we know exactly what has happened.

16:42.068 --> 16:45.280
But in the meantime,
I'm calling the Joint Chiefs.

16:46.072 --> 16:49.075
We've got to put together
some kind of defense.

16:49.159 --> 16:50.869
Quietly, of course.

16:52.078 --> 16:55.373
I was told I could count on you...

16:56.166 --> 16:58.835
where nuclear strategy was concerned.

16:59.169 --> 17:03.173
You, apparently, are one of the few
with access to Kutzville?

17:03.381 --> 17:05.090
Yes, sir. That's correct.

17:05.175 --> 17:07.676
I pray it doesn't come to that,
nuclear weapons.

17:07.761 --> 17:12.348
Of course, Elliot, so do I.
But they might be our only recourse...

17:12.932 --> 17:15.018
in light of what we've seen here.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.730
Let's get things rolling.

17:22.191 --> 17:25.612
If you'd like to look around a little more,
I can go back with him...

17:25.694 --> 17:28.531
make some calls,
check back for you in an hour.

17:28.948 --> 17:31.617
Yes, I'd like that. Thank you.

17:35.955 --> 17:38.916
You know,
I spent 13 years with Project Blue Book...

17:39.667 --> 17:43.421
investigating phenomena
that's turned out to be everything...

17:43.504 --> 17:46.299
from weather satellites
to flocks of geese...

17:47.091 --> 17:49.218
always finding an explanation...

17:50.303 --> 17:53.139
and always hoping, deep down inside me...

17:55.141 --> 17:56.475
that I wouldn't.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.403
Maybe this...

18:09.155 --> 18:11.365
is finally the real thing.

18:16.328 --> 18:18.831
I'm telling you, let me out of here.

18:25.421 --> 18:28.507
Do you hear me? I haven't done anything.

18:36.348 --> 18:40.185
I'm bigger than you.
And you don't frighten me.

18:44.857 --> 18:48.235
Okay, so you got me on that one.

19:25.689 --> 19:28.233
Come no closer, Col. Elliot.

19:32.279 --> 19:35.824
If the others see us here
you will surely be destroyed.

19:46.418 --> 19:47.752
You know who I am?

19:48.003 --> 19:51.756
Our superiors have been monitoring you
and others in your government.

19:52.465 --> 19:54.676
That is how we know you can help us.

19:55.593 --> 19:57.053
How I can help you?

19:57.137 --> 20:01.266
Our superiors intend to destroy all life
on your planet...

20:01.808 --> 20:04.686
in order to mine
its metal-bearing resources.

20:05.228 --> 20:08.732
They must be stopped,
not only to sa ve your planet...

20:09.107 --> 20:11.734
but to show others in our solar system...

20:11.818 --> 20:14.696
that such slaughter will not be tolerated.

20:15.321 --> 20:16.447
What can I do?

20:16.531 --> 20:21.244
Destroy our starship fleet
before it launches its major attack.

20:21.953 --> 20:23.204
How?

20:23.288 --> 20:26.749
Send nuclear warheads to a location...

20:26.958 --> 20:29.836
118 degrees longitude...

20:30.086 --> 20:32.505
42 degrees latitude.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.675
That's in the middle
of the People's Republic of China!

20:35.758 --> 20:40.513
Our superiors 'plan
to launch the attack from here was foiled.

20:41.264 --> 20:44.642
They intend now
to land at those coordinates.

20:45.309 --> 20:48.563
But nuclear warheads will destroy
not only the starship...

20:51.023 --> 20:53.442
but millions of innocent people as well.

20:53.776 --> 20:57.989
Were you to try to warn them,
our superiors would find out...

20:58.114 --> 21:00.241
and simply land somewhere else.

21:00.616 --> 21:03.869
You must launch the warheads
within two hours...

21:04.412 --> 21:06.330
and you must tell no one.

21:06.789 --> 21:08.374
There must be some other way.

21:08.457 --> 21:11.711
Saving billions oflives
throughout the universe...

21:12.128 --> 21:14.922
cannot be achieved without sacrifice.

21:15.923 --> 21:19.510
The two of us will be on the mother ship
when you destroy it.

21:20.010 --> 21:21.679
There is no other way.

21:21.929 --> 21:23.973
I just don't know if I can.

21:24.140 --> 21:28.144
You were hoping before
that this would finally be the real thing.

21:29.228 --> 21:33.566
To our mutual sorrow, Colonel,
indeed it is.

21:50.332 --> 21:52.334
Colonel, you ready to go back?

21:53.836 --> 21:55.504
Yes. Yes, I am.

21:59.174 --> 22:00.717
I've got a lot to do.

22:39.923 --> 22:42.551
- Anything new on the invasion broadcast?
- Nothing new, Colonel.

22:42.634 --> 22:44.469
Good. That's just what I finished
telling them.

22:44.553 --> 22:48.557
Here's more material Ira tracked down
on the pirate station outside Berryville...

22:48.640 --> 22:52.852
here's our lunch,
and here, I'm told, is Diana.

22:55.272 --> 22:57.232
You're exactly 25 minutes late.

22:57.899 --> 22:59.234
Yes, I know.

22:59.317 --> 23:01.736
The worst of it is
I ran into some car trouble...

23:01.820 --> 23:04.364
while I was trying
to locate that pirate transmitter.

23:04.447 --> 23:06.574
I never got there, wherever it is.

23:06.658 --> 23:10.453
You could've said you ran into
some little green men from outer space.

23:10.537 --> 23:12.372
Yes, I suppose I could've.

23:12.455 --> 23:15.083
Steve, somebody has taken
some pretty definite steps...

23:15.166 --> 23:17.419
to see that people don't get near
that transmitter.

23:17.502 --> 23:20.130
My car trouble Was very Well-planned.

23:21.464 --> 23:23.716
Ira just dug up some interesting clues...

23:23.800 --> 23:26.386
that might relate
to the transmitter's operation.

23:26.469 --> 23:27.554
Such as?

23:27.637 --> 23:30.932
Such as a large amount
ofheavy-duty electronic equipment...

23:31.015 --> 23:34.936
recently purchased and believed
to be moved to the Berryville area.

23:35.103 --> 23:39.482
That's the kind of electronic equipment
that could put a TV station into operation.

23:39.565 --> 23:42.151
It seems several low-profile types
are involved.

23:42.235 --> 23:45.279
By low-profile I mean people
of questionable affiliations...

23:45.363 --> 23:46.989
shady characters, that sort of thing.

23:47.073 --> 23:48.408
Anyone in particular?

23:48.491 --> 23:50.451
One of them is Mason Steele.

23:50.535 --> 23:54.580
I've heard of him.
He's an ultra-right-wing fanatic.

23:54.664 --> 23:57.083
He's also on the FBl's keep-an-eye-on list.

23:57.166 --> 24:00.294
Yeah. Especially when there's something
involving Communist China.

24:00.378 --> 24:03.631
I'm going to take another shot
at locating that pirate transmitter.

24:03.714 --> 24:05.967
- Has my tape arrived yet?
- No, not yet.

24:07.051 --> 24:08.636
With everything I've heard today...

24:08.719 --> 24:11.305
the idea of somebody being kidnapped
by a starship...

24:11.389 --> 24:13.099
is beginning to sound tame.

24:13.182 --> 24:14.684
I know what you mean.

24:17.311 --> 24:19.647
At least let me have some air in here.

24:22.441 --> 24:23.818
I'm suffocating.

24:29.657 --> 24:30.825
Do you hear me?

24:30.908 --> 24:33.786
I'm gonna die on you
if you don't get me some air.

24:48.634 --> 24:50.636
That's more like it, you creeps.

25:01.647 --> 25:02.690
Air.

28:16.840 --> 28:21.512
I presume you're trespassing because
you were unbearably anxious to meet us.

28:21.929 --> 28:25.432
- Therefore, my name is Mason-
- Steele.

28:26.517 --> 28:28.393
- And your name?
- I know her.

28:29.019 --> 28:31.104
She's Diana Prince, with the IADC.

28:31.688 --> 28:35.442
That's right. We're on to you, Mr. Steele.

28:35.734 --> 28:37.069
I don't think so.

28:38.111 --> 28:42.741
My name was only one of a dozen or so
your agency pulled out of a hat.

28:44.242 --> 28:47.204
Just so you're not too surprised
when the others get here.

28:47.287 --> 28:50.999
You were supposed to be caught here
snooping, to throw me off guard.

28:51.083 --> 28:54.336
Is that what you want me to believe,
Miss Prince?

28:56.087 --> 28:57.506
I think not.

28:57.589 --> 29:01.384
I think you bungled
across my little warehouse accidentally.

29:01.885 --> 29:05.388
And you shall leave the same way.
Accidentally.

29:05.722 --> 29:07.390
A tragedy, of course.

29:09.059 --> 29:12.687
But that'll have to wait till the future,
until I've finished my work here.

29:12.771 --> 29:16.274
You will be privileged to observe
how these facilities work.

29:18.026 --> 29:19.694
I'd like that very much.

29:19.778 --> 29:23.406
What you'd like very much
is to come across a means of escape.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.533
But you won't.

29:56.105 --> 29:58.232
Only about 20 more miles, Colonel.

29:58.316 --> 30:02.111
That road may come up
a little before that. I'll let you know.

30:04.614 --> 30:07.408
Do you know the significance of Kutzville?

30:07.867 --> 30:11.078
Only that it has something
to do with nuclear missiles.

30:12.788 --> 30:15.625
Less than a dozen people know
where it is...

30:18.336 --> 30:21.464
and even fewer know
how to unleash what lies there.

30:21.714 --> 30:23.716
Is that why we're going there, Colonel?

30:26.969 --> 30:28.554
Just drive faster.

30:35.311 --> 30:39.148
All right, everybody. Look alive.
We've a show to get on the air.

30:45.738 --> 30:48.824
Jim, are we on? Can anybody hear us?

30:50.075 --> 30:52.620
I don't know
if we're transmitting anymore...

30:52.703 --> 30:56.665
but in case we are,
in case anyone out there can hear me...

30:57.416 --> 31:00.920
there are only two of us left.
We've been hiding...

31:01.879 --> 31:03.422
ever since the starships...

31:03.505 --> 31:06.675
devastated that pitifully
outmatched group of men this morning.

31:08.135 --> 31:12.806
And we've been watching, watching
as more and more starships gather.

31:13.474 --> 31:16.894
They appear to be rendezvousing,
comparing notes...

31:16.977 --> 31:20.856
Of course, it'll be much more effective
when we add the sound effects...

31:20.939 --> 31:23.150
and key in the starships behind him.

31:24.276 --> 31:26.862
We'll do that
at the transmitter down the road...

31:26.945 --> 31:28.530
when we broadcast.

31:28.614 --> 31:32.409
And you'll be sure to scramble
the transmission with enough static...

31:32.492 --> 31:35.704
so no one can tell
it's a taped transmission...

31:35.787 --> 31:38.373
and not a live broadcast. Correct?

31:38.457 --> 31:41.710
Grossly underrated medium, television.

31:42.294 --> 31:44.713
The starships are flying out of sight...

31:45.172 --> 31:49.217
over the horizon,
not simply upwards into the heavens.

31:52.763 --> 31:54.890
If anyone out there can hear me...

31:56.099 --> 31:57.726
what I've seen today...

31:58.518 --> 32:02.606
this nightmare of wanton destruction...

32:03.231 --> 32:06.318
this display of merciless,
mindless violence...

32:08.278 --> 32:11.281
from what I've seen today, I'm terrified...

32:11.907 --> 32:13.575
not for myself...

32:13.658 --> 32:16.745
as I've said, the starships appear
to be leaving this area...

32:16.828 --> 32:20.373
I'm terrified for the whole of humanity.

32:21.541 --> 32:24.586
I'm terrified that I've just seen...

32:25.045 --> 32:27.422
the beginning of the end for all of us.

32:28.423 --> 32:30.967
Jim, they've seen us. Get down, Jim!
Get down!

32:31.718 --> 32:32.927
Okay, cut it.

32:34.095 --> 32:37.265
Ed says he'll sweeten that last bit
with a special effect.

32:37.348 --> 32:39.350
Good. Get it to the transmitter quickly.

32:39.434 --> 32:42.645
I want this broadcast on the air
in less than half an hour.

32:51.696 --> 32:54.365
In the first battle
we shot a lot of exteriors.

32:54.449 --> 32:56.618
Then you saw it. Very impressive.

32:56.868 --> 33:00.621
So you were responsible
for the UFO sightings over Berryville?

33:00.913 --> 33:04.667
It was meant to whet the public's appetite
for my little invasion.

33:14.010 --> 33:17.305
You made a UFO out of a blimp
and some colored lights.

33:17.513 --> 33:21.684
Combined with appropriate sound effects,
it could even fool a Martian or two.

33:21.976 --> 33:23.561
The kid got away.

33:24.145 --> 33:28.274
It's all right. If and when he reaches
the authorities, it'll be too late.

33:28.649 --> 33:30.901
The young man you saw earlier...

33:30.985 --> 33:34.322
he came across our UFO unexpectedly.

33:35.156 --> 33:36.824
It was necessary to detain him.

33:36.907 --> 33:38.743
And the rest of your cast?

33:38.951 --> 33:42.413
They were supposed
to discourage potential meddlers?

33:42.621 --> 33:44.957
They and certain foreign objects
on the road?

33:45.040 --> 33:47.042
They also serve a noble purpose.

33:47.418 --> 33:50.754
Speaking of which, Mr. Steele,
I'd like to hear yours.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.090
Why the hoax?

33:53.174 --> 33:55.342
What can you possibly hope
to accomplish?

33:55.426 --> 33:57.219
I'll spare you the details.

33:58.721 --> 34:01.348
Suffice it to say I'm serving my country.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.518
Even as you, perhaps.

34:06.645 --> 34:11.233
Except my hands are not tied
with red tape and political expediency.

34:13.694 --> 34:18.114
I am free to act and destroy
the enemies of the United States...

34:19.116 --> 34:22.745
to do what every freedom-loving patriot
knows has to be done.

34:22.870 --> 34:24.246
I've seen to it...

34:24.705 --> 34:26.456
that at the end of the day...

34:26.540 --> 34:31.378
the entire heartland of Red China
will be obliterated in nuclear holocaust.

34:37.217 --> 34:38.802
You really are insane.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.554
We all have our passions.

34:42.598 --> 34:46.643
Mine is to see that democracy outlives
every other form of government.

34:46.851 --> 34:50.230
The others? They play the lead...

34:51.063 --> 34:53.650
in a magnificent, cosmic tragedy.

35:08.748 --> 35:11.084
I don't even see a town.
Let alone a missile site.

35:11.168 --> 35:14.337
You're seeing exactly
what you're supposed to see. Nothing.

35:14.421 --> 35:16.798
Make a right on that dirt road up there.

35:35.942 --> 35:38.445
- Everybody's all set.
- Good.

35:38.528 --> 35:41.865
Let's see to it that Miss Prince
is covered up with the rest of our tracks...

35:41.948 --> 35:43.575
and be off to the station.

35:43.867 --> 35:47.120
I have an aversion to loud noises.

35:48.163 --> 35:50.707
I daresay you won't hear this one for long.

35:51.708 --> 35:55.628
In a way, for your sake,
I almost hope you never realize the truth...

35:55.795 --> 35:57.839
that you've done more
to destroy democracy...

35:57.922 --> 36:00.091
than any communist country
ever dreamed of doing.

36:00.174 --> 36:01.759
Put a gag on her mouth.

36:02.927 --> 36:05.471
I don't have to listen
to these obscenities...

36:05.555 --> 36:07.557
not from someone
who has never done anything...

36:07.640 --> 36:10.768
to see that her country prevails
on the face of the earth.

36:10.852 --> 36:14.147
Just give us time to clear the building.
Three minutes.

36:15.773 --> 36:19.026
At least you're about to die,
in a sense, for your country.

36:19.402 --> 36:21.320
That's more than you deserve.

38:19.563 --> 38:21.815
I was wondering what happened to you.

38:21.898 --> 38:24.484
It was a good thing I came back
to look for my camera.

38:24.568 --> 38:26.486
Those jerks better not have damaged it.

38:26.570 --> 38:29.531
It's bad enough
they already dropped my tape recorder.

38:30.073 --> 38:32.450
Hang on. I'll have you free in a second.

38:32.534 --> 38:34.411
What maniac tied this?

38:38.289 --> 38:40.542
Holy criminy, that's a... It's a bomb!

38:44.421 --> 38:45.630
Hold on.

38:48.925 --> 38:51.052
All right, now, Henry, just think.

38:52.303 --> 38:55.682
That news clip you saw in class
about the bomb squad.

38:58.685 --> 39:00.728
What's the first thing they did?

39:07.402 --> 39:10.947
Disconnected the timing device
from the detonator switch.

39:35.012 --> 39:37.431
Never knew my heart could beat so fast.

39:38.057 --> 39:40.893
Henry Wilson, I think I love you.

39:41.936 --> 39:43.312
You know who I am?

39:43.479 --> 39:45.022
The whole country does.

39:45.106 --> 39:47.441
Everyone thinks
you're on your way to Mars.

39:47.525 --> 39:48.734
No kidding?

39:49.151 --> 39:51.195
I have to find the transmitter
they're using.

39:51.278 --> 39:53.406
Transmitter? There's no...

39:54.532 --> 39:56.575
Wait a minute, the old Barnes place.

39:56.659 --> 39:58.494
There's a transmitter there?

39:58.577 --> 39:59.703
Yeah, maybe.

39:59.954 --> 40:02.331
Couple of weeks ago
some out-of-towners bought it.

40:02.414 --> 40:04.959
Started installing
all sorts of electronic equipment.

40:05.042 --> 40:06.961
Said they were
with the power department.

40:07.044 --> 40:08.754
Okay, how do I get there?

40:09.421 --> 40:12.758
Let's see, you go out to the main road
and then you make a left...

40:12.841 --> 40:15.261
and it's about 4 miles.

40:15.344 --> 40:18.681
So a shortcut would be
straight through the woods outside, right?

40:18.764 --> 40:20.266
Yeah, I guess.

40:23.268 --> 40:25.187
I want you to take my car back to town.

40:25.270 --> 40:27.773
- But how are you gonna...
- I have a friend.

40:31.860 --> 40:33.278
In the woods?

41:07.688 --> 41:09.398
- We're going inside here?
- Yes.

41:09.981 --> 41:13.777
An elevator will take us several
hundred feet down to the launch room.

41:16.196 --> 41:17.823
Have your piece ready.

41:36.049 --> 41:38.718
Looks like Col. Robert Elliot
is on his way down.

41:38.802 --> 41:42.722
Funny, I didn't get word he was coming.
He has A-to-Z clearance.

41:43.890 --> 41:45.850
He's on again.

41:46.893 --> 41:49.354
I don't know
if we're transmitting anymore...

41:49.437 --> 41:53.024
but in case we are,
in case anyone out there can hear me...

41:54.234 --> 41:55.944
there are only two of us left.

41:56.027 --> 41:58.988
As it turns out,
this broadcast is just icing on the cake.

41:59.072 --> 42:00.698
We haven't heard from Jerry yet...

42:00.782 --> 42:03.284
which means
they must be at the missile site.

42:10.792 --> 42:12.919
How dare you do this to me,
Wonder Woman?

42:13.002 --> 42:14.170
This is treasonous!

42:15.254 --> 42:18.549
You weren't really planning on leaving,
were you, gentlemen?

42:23.846 --> 42:28.267
I think it's time someone started you
on your way to getting some help, Steele.

42:28.434 --> 42:32.230
She must be executed as an example
to all those who idolized her.

42:32.563 --> 42:33.648
Get her!

42:35.149 --> 42:36.776
We've got to do something.

43:05.346 --> 43:08.724
Come on. On your feet and fight!

43:11.268 --> 43:12.520
Stop her.

43:27.910 --> 43:32.039
With patriots like you,
this country doesn't need any enemies.

43:32.956 --> 43:35.793
I want you to tell me the whole plan,
and if it's necessary...

43:35.876 --> 43:39.046
you're going to put me
in front of one of those cameras in there.

43:39.129 --> 43:42.382
Surely you don't intend to launch
the warheads? Colonel, you can't!

43:42.466 --> 43:45.094
I'm one of five people in this country
who can.

43:45.427 --> 43:46.637
...not for myself...

43:46.720 --> 43:50.057
as I've said, the starships appear
to be lea ving this area...

43:50.724 --> 43:54.353
I'm terrified for the Whole ofbhumanity.

43:56.355 --> 43:57.856
Jerry, take care of that noise.

43:57.940 --> 44:00.067
You're activating
a fail-safe mechanism that-

44:00.150 --> 44:01.735
That I helped design.

44:07.199 --> 44:09.034
Which I have just overridden.

44:19.711 --> 44:21.713
118 degrees longitude...

44:24.090 --> 44:25.675
32 degrees latitude.

44:27.928 --> 44:29.429
It will soon be over.

44:30.680 --> 44:33.225
How I wish this didn't rest
on my shoulders.

44:35.310 --> 44:36.561
Wait, Colonel. Look!

44:36.645 --> 44:39.272
No starships, no battle, no invasion.

44:39.397 --> 44:40.523
Turn it up.

44:40.649 --> 44:42.442
The broadcast you were just watching...

44:42.525 --> 44:45.904
and the one transmitted earlier today
were part of a hoax.

44:45.987 --> 44:48.239
It's a trick. Get on with it, Colonel.

44:50.158 --> 44:53.870
There was not going to be a landing
in Red China or anywhere else.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.998
This was all for the benefit
of Col. Robert Elliot.

44:57.082 --> 44:59.375
He was fooled into going to Kutzville.

44:59.459 --> 45:02.796
I repeat,
Col. Robert Elliot is in Kutzville.

45:03.254 --> 45:06.299
Get m e General Eberhart.
Emergency priority.

45:06.591 --> 45:10.011
The broadcasts that he and everyone else
saw today were not live...

45:10.094 --> 45:11.638
they were videotapes.

45:11.721 --> 45:14.974
There is no cause for alarm,
no reason to panic.

45:15.058 --> 45:17.435
Col. Elliot, if you can hear me...

45:17.560 --> 45:21.105
your aide is actually working
for the man behind all this.

45:21.189 --> 45:24.776
He's been spying on you, manipulating you
with the help of others.

45:25.068 --> 45:29.739
Colonel, please,
there has been and will be no invasion.

45:32.658 --> 45:33.868
Good Lord!

45:34.305 --> 45:40.235
