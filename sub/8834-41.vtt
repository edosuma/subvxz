Nothing to eat around here.

01:13.917 --> 01:17.000
I guess this will have
to last me till lunch.

01:17.083 --> 01:17.917
Mm.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.458
[Rebecca] Oh, Baloo!

01:19.542 --> 01:20.792
Uh-oh.

01:23.125 --> 01:27.625
There you are. I wanted you to see
the gown I'm wearing to the Pilots' ball.

01:27.709 --> 01:29.000
What do you think?

01:29.083 --> 01:31.250
[indistinct sounds]

01:31.333 --> 01:34.000
Are you eating in the office again?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.625
Who? Me?

01:37.709 --> 01:41.625
If only I didn't have to go the
Pilots' ball with a pilot.

01:41.709 --> 01:42.542
[smacks lips]

01:42.625 --> 01:44.625
Especially a plump pilot.

01:44.709 --> 01:49.000
Still I suppose anyone
can look good in a tuxedo.

01:49.417 --> 01:50.500
Even you.

01:50.583 --> 01:53.000
You do have a tuxedo, don't you?

01:53.083 --> 01:55.750
Hey, do penguins swim?

01:55.875 --> 01:59.583
Oh, relax, Becky.
Ol' Baloo won't let you down.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.375
You mean you're gonna lose weight?

02:01.458 --> 02:03.834
Cross my heart and hope to diet.

02:04.583 --> 02:08.709
Wait till Rebecca gets
a load of me in this.

02:08.834 --> 02:10.667
So suave.

02:10.750 --> 02:11.875
So deboner.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.625
So... so... so...

02:14.709 --> 02:16.291
-Fat.
-[grunts]

02:16.417 --> 02:22.166
Not fat. Just a bit well upholstered.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.583
Man, that baby had topspin.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.500
Maybe this'll help, Papa Bear.

02:33.875 --> 02:36.750
Whoa. I look like a fireplug.

02:36.834 --> 02:38.750
That's it.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.417
Oops.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.875
Let's face it, Little Britches,
I need big britches.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.750
If I don't drop some tonnage
before the Pilots' ball,

02:49.834 --> 02:52.542
Becky's gonna find herself another escort.

02:52.625 --> 02:56.458
Why don't you go to that famous fat farm,
the Elizabeth Taper Center.

02:56.542 --> 03:00.333
You mean where all the big stars go
when they get too big?

03:00.417 --> 03:02.250
Yeah. I heard about it on the radio.

03:02.333 --> 03:05.583
They have the strictest
weight-loss counselors around.

03:05.667 --> 03:09.500
Well, if it's good enough
for a big star like Liz Taper,

03:09.583 --> 03:11.250
it's good enough for me.

03:14.375 --> 03:17.542
Yee-haw!

03:23.792 --> 03:26.291
How much farther to the island, Wildcat?

03:26.375 --> 03:28.709
They're those green things
on the map, right?

03:29.250 --> 03:30.458
Right in one guess.

03:34.917 --> 03:37.500
Seems like there's more of them
than they used to be.

03:37.583 --> 03:42.333
Do you always start a diet with
a double order of guacamole tacos?

03:42.709 --> 03:46.125
You wouldn't want me to lose weight
on an empty stomach, would you?

03:46.208 --> 03:48.041
That looks like the island now.

03:48.125 --> 03:51.417
Tell Rebecca I'll be back in time
to go to the party.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.834
We'll tell her, Baloo.

03:52.917 --> 03:55.417
And don't tell her I'm losing weight.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.250
That's gonna be my surprise.

04:04.125 --> 04:09.667
All I gotta do now is find that health spa
and drop a few pounderoos.

04:11.291 --> 04:13.542
[humming]

04:16.166 --> 04:18.916
Ooh, man, what a scorcher.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.500
Say, now I can rest my dogs.

04:25.583 --> 04:29.375
Why can't they put these spas in
a more convenient spot?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.333
Like next to a diner.

04:38.625 --> 04:40.667
[guard] Hut-to! Hut-to! Hut-to!

04:43.208 --> 04:46.458
You prisoners, pick up your feet!

04:46.542 --> 04:47.875
This is a work detail.

04:47.959 --> 04:51.083
You're back home in Thembria now.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.834
Whatta ya know? I found 'em.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.041
Hi, guys. Some place.

04:59.125 --> 05:01.458
You're lean and mean.

05:01.542 --> 05:05.250
[foreign accent] Just what we need,
a comedian.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.875
Naw, I'm a pilot.

05:06.959 --> 05:09.834
Baloo's the name and flyin's the game.

05:09.917 --> 05:12.083
Did you say "a pilot?"

05:12.166 --> 05:15.208
Sure. If it's got wings I can fly it.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.375
Sometimes if it doesn't.

05:17.458 --> 05:19.542
Keep marching and no talking!

05:19.625 --> 05:22.375
Double time! Hut-to! Hut-to! Hut-to!

05:27.208 --> 05:30.041
[Baloo] I hope we get to meet
Elizabeth Taper.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.875
My name is Slammer.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.375
Welcome to your new home.

05:34.458 --> 05:36.875
You will all be given a copy of the rules.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.166
Read it. Memorize it.

05:39.458 --> 05:45.291
You will also be provided with some,
ah, special equipment.

05:45.375 --> 05:46.792
Ankle weights, huh?

05:46.875 --> 05:50.000
That ought to tone up the old legs.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.417
Ooh. Hey, a medicine ball.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.208
A great workout.

05:54.667 --> 05:55.667
Yaaaa!

05:56.250 --> 05:57.875
Guards!

05:58.750 --> 06:00.917
When the sun shines on this box,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.333
it can get up to 200 degrees inside.

06:04.417 --> 06:07.583
A solar-powered sauna, huh?
Oh, pretty neat.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.083
Glad you like it.

06:10.166 --> 06:11.500
Throw him in!

06:14.041 --> 06:16.667
[Baloo] Hey. How 'bout leaving me
a box lunch?

06:25.125 --> 06:26.959
Thanks, guys.

06:27.041 --> 06:30.083
I feel like I've sweated
off 10 pounds already.

06:31.458 --> 06:35.250
[Slammer] I hope you've gained something
from this experience.

06:35.333 --> 06:38.458
Gained? I thought
I was supposed to be losing.

06:38.875 --> 06:40.959
Oh, a comedian.

06:41.041 --> 06:42.250
Naw, I'm a pilot.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.125
Baloo's the name and flying's the--

06:44.208 --> 06:45.291
Silence!

06:45.375 --> 06:47.959
This is going in your file!

06:48.375 --> 06:50.375
You better shape up!

06:50.458 --> 06:53.041
You're telling me. Rebecca'll kill me.

06:53.125 --> 06:55.166
Get over there and start pedaling.

06:55.250 --> 06:58.750
Good idea. There's nothing
like an exercise bike

06:58.834 --> 07:00.625
to trim down the waistline.

07:00.709 --> 07:05.333
Ooh, it can be so tiring
being cruel and sadistic.

07:05.417 --> 07:06.875
Faster!

07:18.792 --> 07:21.250
[rooster crows]

07:26.667 --> 07:30.041
Ooh, what a short night.

07:30.208 --> 07:33.417
Huh! My fan's gone! I've been robbed!

07:33.500 --> 07:36.417
Someone's going to prison for this.

07:36.875 --> 07:40.333
[laughs] I forgot.
We're already in prison.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.083
[snoring]

07:44.000 --> 07:45.458
Playing innocent, huh?

07:45.542 --> 07:48.208
You don't fool me. Wake up!

07:48.291 --> 07:50.291
Steal my ceiling fan, will you?

07:50.375 --> 07:52.583
This is going in your file!

07:52.667 --> 07:55.667
What? Now he's stolen my filing cabinet.

07:57.417 --> 07:58.917
Take 'im to the box!

07:59.000 --> 08:01.709
How about some breakfast first?

08:02.667 --> 08:05.458
[Baloo] Now I know how a fried egg feels.

08:05.542 --> 08:09.291
Ooh, with bacon, orange juice.

08:09.792 --> 08:14.917
Oh, if only a day without orange juice
was a day without sunshine.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.792
Hot enough for you?

08:16.875 --> 08:19.542
If only your lunch was so hot.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.792
Lunch? Why didn't you say so?

08:25.208 --> 08:28.500
Fo-ooo-ood! At last!

08:28.583 --> 08:32.082
I don't mind being on a diet as
long as there's plenty to eat.

08:32.582 --> 08:34.457
Gruel, huh?

08:34.542 --> 08:36.625
The chef must be from Thembria.

08:49.917 --> 08:51.583
This is just steam.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.417
You are lucky.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.083
Yesterday it was cold steam.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.917
Of course it could be worse.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.667
It could begruel!

09:02.375 --> 09:05.583
I can't stand it.
I've got to have something to eat.

09:05.667 --> 09:08.875
Please, sir. I want some more.

09:08.959 --> 09:10.875
More steam?

09:10.959 --> 09:14.125
I'll give you more steam.

09:14.208 --> 09:18.834
Aah. Woo-hooo. Waaa!

09:21.208 --> 09:25.375
That's it! I don't care if Rebecca
does think I'm a fat slob,

09:25.458 --> 09:26.625
I am leaving!

09:27.208 --> 09:33.583
No one ever leaves Bedevilled Island
maximum security prison.

09:33.792 --> 09:36.625
Prison? I thought this was a health spa.

09:36.709 --> 09:39.625
Do I look like Elizabeth Taper?

09:44.834 --> 09:48.125
Theft of a Thembrian
government ceiling fan.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.250
Violation of Thembrian government funds.

09:51.333 --> 09:54.750
Wanton destruction
of Thembrian government dishes.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.125
And worst of all--

09:57.208 --> 10:00.750
Wasting Thembrian government steam.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.709
Do you know what
the punishment is for that?

10:03.792 --> 10:05.250
Another trip to the sauna?

10:05.333 --> 10:08.875
Not quite, but you're gettin' warm.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.291
Mind if I borrow this?

10:12.375 --> 10:15.166
[Baloo] Go ahead.
I was starting to chafe anyway.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.000
Why the blindfold?

10:17.083 --> 10:19.750
Am I supposed to break
a piñata or something?

10:19.834 --> 10:24.542
No. You're about to be executed
by a firing squad.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.417
Firing squad?! Wait! Wait!

10:27.500 --> 10:29.542
I'm allergic to lead!

10:33.834 --> 10:35.041
Ready...

10:35.125 --> 10:36.250
No! No! I'm not!

10:36.333 --> 10:37.500
Aim...

10:37.583 --> 10:38.792
Wait!

10:38.875 --> 10:41.208
Don't I get a last request?

10:41.959 --> 10:47.041
Since there's no need to diet anymore,
I'd like a big lunch

10:47.125 --> 10:48.500
with a side of dinner.

10:48.583 --> 10:51.333
Let's start with roast beef.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.959
And mashed potatoes and angel food cake,

10:55.041 --> 10:58.917
devil's food cake
somewhere in between cake.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.417
Oh, and some wild duck,

11:01.500 --> 11:04.500
and also some mildly annoyed duck--

11:04.875 --> 11:05.959
Fire!

11:08.083 --> 11:09.375
[sighs]

11:09.458 --> 11:11.542
There's something wrong, sir.

11:11.625 --> 11:13.750
Well, find out what the problem is.

11:13.834 --> 11:17.208
There's no gunpowder in the shells, sir.

11:17.291 --> 11:20.041
They must be leftover from
the last gunpowder shortage.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.542
Tough luck, huh?

11:21.625 --> 11:22.959
For you it is.

11:23.041 --> 11:26.125
It's against the rules not to die
at your own execution.

11:26.208 --> 11:28.709
You'll get another 20 years for that.

11:28.792 --> 11:31.083
Hey, I did my part.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.750
I didn't even peek.

11:36.333 --> 11:39.834
That's 219 years you'll be in prison.

11:39.917 --> 11:41.583
Not counting today.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.500
Couldn't you let me out a little early?

11:43.583 --> 11:46.417
Like Saturday. I've got to
take my boss to a party.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.750
Saturday... that's it.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.333
We get a new shipment of ammunition
on Saturday.

11:51.417 --> 11:53.041
We can shoot you then.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.458
I better go Saturday night.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.917
This glue sure is heavy.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.750
Phew! I hope Baloo's lost a lot of weight.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.834
Oh, not too much.

12:11.917 --> 12:15.959
I had an aunt who lost 2,000 pounds
and she was miserable.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.875
Two thousand pounds?

12:17.959 --> 12:19.667
Yeah. Her car was stolen.

12:19.750 --> 12:23.709
[sighs] I just hope we can find
The Elizabeth Taper Center again.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.458
Which island is it?

12:25.542 --> 12:27.291
This guacamole one.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.458
Guacamole?

12:29.542 --> 12:31.041
Bedevilled Island!

12:31.125 --> 12:34.625
That's where the Thembrians
send their worst prisoners.

12:34.709 --> 12:39.750
Lucky for Baloo, he went
to the Isle of Guacamole, instead.

12:39.834 --> 12:42.417
Wildcat, we've got to help Baloo.

12:53.583 --> 12:56.750
If they're gonna execute a guy tomorrow,

12:57.333 --> 13:00.333
they could at least give him the day off.

13:01.834 --> 13:03.917
[rock cracking]

13:13.959 --> 13:15.250
Hey, that's neat.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.583
How'd you do that?

13:17.375 --> 13:21.709
It's a question
of knowing where to strike.

13:26.458 --> 13:29.834
Hey, what's a smart guy like you
doing in prison?

13:29.917 --> 13:33.250
I don't know. I am innocent.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.959
There's probably
a law against that in Thembria.

13:36.041 --> 13:40.208
It broke my dear old mother's heart
when they sent me here.

13:40.291 --> 13:43.667
You see, tomorrow is her 80th birthday.

13:43.750 --> 13:47.250
I promised to give her a party.

13:47.333 --> 13:50.000
I sure wish there was
some way I could help you.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.125
Ah, but there is.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.417
You are a pilot, no?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.959
I'm the greatest pilot in the world,
by my own estimation.

13:58.041 --> 14:01.375
I have built an airplane.

14:01.458 --> 14:04.083
It can fly us both off this island.

14:04.166 --> 14:05.792
All right!

14:05.875 --> 14:09.250
But only if we do not overload it.

14:09.333 --> 14:14.417
Lose 10 pounds by tonight, my friend,
<i>und </i> we're out of here.

14:14.500 --> 14:18.166
Ten pounds? Maybe we better
just let then shoot me.

14:18.250 --> 14:22.291
Do not worry. I will help you.

14:24.959 --> 14:27.458
One-two! One-two! One-two!

14:27.542 --> 14:29.375
Let's pick up those knees.

14:34.792 --> 14:39.291
Quietly. We don't want
the guard to hear us.

14:41.375 --> 14:45.000
[sniffing] Something smells good.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.834
Hmm. Leftovers.

14:47.834 --> 14:50.959
We escape now, eat later.

14:51.041 --> 14:53.458
And be quiet.

14:55.458 --> 14:58.375
[sirens]

15:06.583 --> 15:09.083
Hurry! We have to take off.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.166
You're the one who stole all that stuff.

15:11.250 --> 15:15.083
Yes, <i>und </i> the motors
from the Colonel Slammer's new car too.

15:15.166 --> 15:18.166
Built during the Thembrian motor shortage.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.667
[machine-gun fire]

15:21.750 --> 15:24.208
Why don't they ever have
a bullet shortage?

15:28.333 --> 15:32.166
Escaping from prison.
You'll get life for this!

15:35.750 --> 15:39.375
[Kit] We thought this island was
The Elizabeth Taper Center.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.583
But it was just a glob of guacamole.

15:42.667 --> 15:46.709
That is the most unbelievable story
I've ever heard.

15:46.792 --> 15:50.875
[Rebecca] And you say Baloo did all this
just so he wouldn't disappoint me?

15:50.959 --> 15:53.125
[Wildcat] Hey, you said
it was unbelievable.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.291
[Rebecca] I wonder which way the camp is.

15:55.375 --> 15:59.208
Oh, let me. I'm a great tracker.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.000
Oh!

16:07.834 --> 16:09.667
Ah-ha, ah-ha.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.375
[Wildcat] No, no, no, no.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.792
The camp's a half mile that way.

16:17.875 --> 16:21.500
That's amazing, Wildcat.
How'd you do that?

16:21.917 --> 16:23.458
I read this sign.

16:24.875 --> 16:28.083
[Rebecca] What do you mean, he's escaped?

16:28.166 --> 16:31.041
Baloo's not a fat criminal.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.000
He's a fat pilot!

16:33.083 --> 16:36.750
Then why did he help
Professor Crackpotkin escape?

16:36.834 --> 16:39.250
Who is Professor Crackpotkin?

16:39.333 --> 16:41.917
A scientist who hates gruel.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.375
Every day for 20 years
his mother fed him gruel.

16:45.458 --> 16:46.750
Gruel for breakfast.

16:46.834 --> 16:48.500
Gruel burgers for lunch.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.041
Gruel pizzas for dinner.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.959
It drove him mad.

16:52.458 --> 16:56.917
He was in prison for trying
to implement the Crackpotkin plan.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.333
A diabolical plan to destroy

17:00.458 --> 17:03.709
all the glorious Thembrian gruel reserves.

17:03.792 --> 17:06.000
And he hasn't given up yet.

17:06.083 --> 17:08.625
Crackpotkin left these blueprints behind.

17:08.709 --> 17:10.916
His airplane is a flying bomb.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.083
Packed with enough stolen gunpowder

17:13.165 --> 17:16.333
to blow a hole in the
central gruel reservoir.

17:16.416 --> 17:19.375
[Slammer] <i>So I've radioed ahead</i>
<i>to Colonel Spigot.</i>

17:19.625 --> 17:25.125
<i>He's ready to shoot the plane down</i>
<i>as soon as it reaches the gruel reserves.</i>

17:28.375 --> 17:30.000
[Rebecca] Faster, Wildcat!

17:30.083 --> 17:31.625
We've got to save Baloo.

17:31.750 --> 17:35.208
OK. Hold onto your airsick bags.

17:36.625 --> 17:37.875
[Baloo] Now, Cracky, baby,

17:37.959 --> 17:40.458
as soon as I get you back to your mother

17:40.542 --> 17:42.709
I'm flying on to Cape Suzette.

17:42.792 --> 17:46.625
I'm escorting a very special lady
to a party tonight.

17:48.709 --> 17:50.959
Looks like I might be late.

17:51.959 --> 17:54.917
[Colonel Spiget] Sergeant Dunder, load.

18:00.959 --> 18:04.000
Really Big Bertha's loaded,
Colonel Spigot, sir.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.834
Would you like me to aim?

18:05.917 --> 18:07.667
I will do it, Dunder.

18:08.750 --> 18:09.709
Sergeant Dunder!

18:09.792 --> 18:11.709
Sorry, sir.

18:12.250 --> 18:15.542
Ah-ha! This time we can't miss.

18:19.291 --> 18:20.250
Fire.

18:23.834 --> 18:26.792
I didn't blow them out of the sky!

18:27.250 --> 18:29.542
But you made a really big boom.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.208
Crackpotkin will make an even bigger boom

18:32.291 --> 18:34.542
<i>when he blows up the gruel reserves.</i>

18:36.041 --> 18:37.875
We're almost there.

18:37.959 --> 18:40.959
Nothing can stop me now!

18:42.000 --> 18:43.041
Hey!

18:46.792 --> 18:48.875
[Kit] Baloo! Turn back!

18:48.959 --> 18:51.583
Crackpotkin is a mad scientist!

18:51.667 --> 18:54.000
Huh? A bad scientist?

18:54.125 --> 18:57.458
Hang on, Professor.
I'll get you to your mommy

18:57.542 --> 18:59.959
no matter how bad your grades were.

19:01.542 --> 19:03.291
I don't think he understood us.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.959
We've got to head them off.

19:09.417 --> 19:11.834
Maybe we should let
your mother know you're coming.

19:12.208 --> 19:15.542
We'll just drop in.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.333
Huh!

19:18.542 --> 19:22.458
I'm putting you
on a crime diet, my friend.

19:22.625 --> 19:26.792
Goodbye, gruel world!

19:27.291 --> 19:30.291
I don't think he even has a mother.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.625
[screams]

19:33.709 --> 19:36.875
Come on, Wildcat. It's time
to do some serious flying.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.208
Well, here goes everything.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.166
Jump!

19:48.250 --> 19:50.875
Do I look like a Mexican jumping bear?

19:50.959 --> 19:53.458
Don't argue, Baloo!
Do you want to blow up?

19:53.542 --> 19:55.458
Well, now that you mention it--

19:55.875 --> 19:58.291
Noooo!

20:01.792 --> 20:03.792
You've lost some weight, haven't you?

20:03.875 --> 20:06.041
No time to discuss diets now, Rebecca.

20:06.125 --> 20:08.291
I've got me some flying to do.

20:13.208 --> 20:14.834
Excuse me, Little Britches.

20:16.834 --> 20:17.834
It's too late!

20:17.917 --> 20:19.041
The whole city's gonna be buried

20:19.125 --> 20:21.375
under a flood
of high-fiber breakfast food.

20:24.792 --> 20:27.583
They will eat their words now.

20:31.041 --> 20:32.625
What are we gonna do, Baloo?

20:34.959 --> 20:37.709
[Baloo] Hey, Crackpotkin
stuck me with this.

20:37.792 --> 20:40.375
It's time I returned the favor.

20:40.834 --> 20:44.000
There's only one way to stop that gruel...

20:44.125 --> 20:45.458
Hunger attack!

20:49.834 --> 20:51.834
I don't think I'm hungry, sir.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.500
Loss of appetite in the face of the enemy?

20:54.583 --> 20:56.667
Put yourself on report, Dunder!

21:01.834 --> 21:04.917
This ought to make
that gruel stick to their ribs.

21:05.125 --> 21:07.375
Glue away!

21:17.333 --> 21:22.125
You may have stopped the gruel,
but you will never stop me!

21:22.208 --> 21:24.000
[Crackpotkin screaming]

21:28.250 --> 21:31.000
That ought to hold him
till Spigot gets here.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.625
Now, how about some lunch?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.291
I'm starved.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.291
[Baloo] Mm. Mm.

21:40.166 --> 21:45.458
I'll be ready for the Pilots' ball
as soon as I get my strength back.

21:46.083 --> 21:48.291
I'm touched you tried so hard, Baloo.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.709
But appearances don't matter.

21:50.834 --> 21:52.792
It's what's inside that counts.

21:52.875 --> 21:56.333
And I'm gonna get as much inside as I can.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.917
Hey, a present.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.166
You deserve something
for trying to get in shape.

22:03.250 --> 22:05.750
[Rebecca] Even if it was hopeless.

22:05.834 --> 22:08.208
An elastic cummerbund.

22:08.291 --> 22:12.166
You don't have to be slim and trim
to be a great pilot.

22:12.250 --> 22:13.709
The way I look at it,

22:13.834 --> 22:17.166
the more you weigh,
the more of you there is to order around.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.625
Yeah... Huh?
