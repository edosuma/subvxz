_

00:09.269 --> 00:12.880
Zoe Taylor ran a group
counselling course.

00:12.886 --> 00:15.107
Iman attended that course.

00:15.113 --> 00:19.105
- Pennisi attended the same sessions.
- Shit!

00:20.654 --> 00:22.509
Right, everyone, step back!

00:22.883 --> 00:24.693
Call medical! Everybody stand...

00:24.699 --> 00:26.081
Good news from the hospital,

00:26.087 --> 00:27.705
Sonia's off the critical list.

00:27.711 --> 00:29.921
Well, doctors reckon
that she was poisoned.

00:30.777 --> 00:32.284
_

00:33.607 --> 00:35.696
- Has anyone seen you?!
- Look, I gotta keep movin'.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.646
- I was gonna ask you for a ride. Iman's place.
- To where?!

00:38.652 --> 00:40.806
If there was any evidence the
police would have found it.

00:40.812 --> 00:43.052
She's not a suspect. It's just me.

00:43.058 --> 00:44.258
This chick here...

00:44.528 --> 00:46.742
my fuckin' property! You got that?

00:46.748 --> 00:50.004
- Whatever.
- Spike Baxter. She was attacked,

00:50.010 --> 00:51.570
in the showers today.

00:51.576 --> 00:54.280
I'll find out who did that
and there'll be repercussions.

00:54.286 --> 00:56.202
And I mean they will fucking pay!

00:56.208 --> 00:57.408
It was me.

00:57.470 --> 00:58.670
Girls.

01:01.834 --> 01:03.034
Oh, fuck!

01:05.920 --> 01:07.120
- What the hell are you doing?!
- _

01:07.126 --> 01:09.937
These backups prove you let
Bea Smith into no man's land.

01:10.239 --> 01:11.548
That's my insurance.

Ugh! Ugh!

02:04.726 --> 02:05.940
Get her!

02:08.624 --> 02:10.433
You fuckin' bastard!

02:13.497 --> 02:14.813
How'd you go?

02:14.819 --> 02:16.393
Ho-ho, good!

02:16.399 --> 02:17.599
Huh!

02:17.718 --> 02:18.985
Ripper!

02:22.931 --> 02:24.131
Yeah!

02:32.284 --> 02:33.625
Oi, Einstein...

02:34.837 --> 02:36.037
your sister's up.

02:37.931 --> 02:39.133
Here we go.

02:42.341 --> 02:43.541
Yes!

02:43.840 --> 02:45.753
You right? Yep. Good to go.

02:50.331 --> 02:51.531

You get 'im, Reets!

03:01.591 --> 03:02.971
Your form's not bad, girl.

03:15.854 --> 03:17.450
- Morning, Vera.
- Fuck you!

03:20.351 --> 03:24.562
Medical informs me there was a
workplace accident in the laundry.

03:25.754 --> 03:28.485
Do we need to put further
safety measures in place?

03:28.491 --> 03:29.691
I wouldn't have thought so.

03:29.697 --> 03:31.359
Protocols are in place...

03:31.511 --> 03:33.601
- Connors just didn't follow them.
- Can I help you?

03:34.779 --> 03:37.557
And you've stepped up as
a leader who'll enforce

03:37.563 --> 03:39.402
the necessary protocols when required?

03:40.470 --> 03:41.882
Do you need to get that?

03:42.153 --> 03:44.966
It's the press, my PA will get it.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.946
- Governor Bennett's office...
- Well, hopefully

03:47.952 --> 03:50.258
having seen what happened
to one prisoner...

03:50.438 --> 03:53.096
safety protocols will be
adhered to in the future.

03:57.382 --> 03:58.787
How's the hand?

04:00.473 --> 04:03.263
Kaz went a bit over the top, sorry.

04:03.864 --> 04:07.237
Well, for what it's worth,
Spike's a piece of work.

04:07.243 --> 04:09.730
I'm sure, whatever she
did, she was asking for it.

04:14.759 --> 04:16.377
Hey, sugar tits.

04:16.471 --> 04:17.869
In the house.

04:20.259 --> 04:21.868
She's taking an interest.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.687
Maybe she's got the hots for you.

04:23.693 --> 04:26.498
You're so full of shit,
it's you she's looking at.

04:27.837 --> 04:29.537
Hey, Kaz. Kaz?!

04:29.543 --> 04:31.426
What's the deal with Boomer,
why is she in the slot?

04:31.432 --> 04:32.892
They reckon she poisoned Sonia.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.307
- Oh, what?!
- What?

04:34.313 --> 04:36.148
- Why would she do that?
- No idea.

04:36.236 --> 04:39.286
Hey, Mr Jackson, can you get
the Governor to spring Boomer?

04:39.292 --> 04:42.572
There is no way that she poisoned
Sonia, she's her biggest fan.

04:42.578 --> 04:44.065
They say her tea was spiked.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.702
Boomer spiked her tea? That's bullshit!

04:46.807 --> 04:49.696
There's no way that Boomer
would do that. For what reason?

04:58.938 --> 05:01.037
Oi! God!

05:01.105 --> 05:02.924
Oi, that's my stuff!

05:02.930 --> 05:05.233
- Argh!
- Fuck off!

05:05.461 --> 05:07.547
Fuck no! Fuck!

05:11.398 --> 05:12.598
Oh!

05:12.982 --> 05:14.465
Fuck off!

05:14.471 --> 05:16.906
Go on, get out!

05:18.656 --> 05:20.311
Ya piece of shit. Go!

05:20.648 --> 05:23.806
- Fuck you, all right.
- Fuck off and don't come back!

05:38.576 --> 05:40.507
ZT?

05:40.736 --> 05:42.358
Zoe Taylor.

06:06.744 --> 06:08.810
Stevens, welcome back.

06:08.816 --> 06:10.260
How are you feeling?

06:11.260 --> 06:12.938
I cheated death.

06:16.462 --> 06:17.790
- I need to know about your
- _

06:17.796 --> 06:19.694
involvement with the workshop escape.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.107
My involvement?! I
know nothing about it.

06:22.113 --> 06:23.789
Yeah, it's funny that, no one does.

06:23.795 --> 06:25.921
And yet two prisoners couldn't
have escaped without help

06:25.927 --> 06:29.605
- or someone knowing something.
- Why would I sabotage my own pride and joy?!

06:29.611 --> 06:31.803
- You tell me.
- Particularly to assist Joan Ferguson,

06:31.809 --> 06:33.837
who, by the way, you
really should have let hang.

06:33.843 --> 06:35.914
Okay, what about Doyle?
Did you assist her?

06:35.920 --> 06:38.488
Seriously, Governor, this is absurd.

06:38.722 --> 06:40.925
I had hoped you might pay
a little bit of attention

06:40.931 --> 06:43.347
- to who poisoned me!
- Right, that I know.

06:44.268 --> 06:45.469
Susan Jenkins

06:45.475 --> 06:47.860
- has just been charged with attempted murder.
- Susan?!

06:54.929 --> 06:56.426
Jenkins, you got a visitor.

06:56.432 --> 06:58.046
You got one minute, tops.

06:58.305 --> 06:59.669
That's all I need.

06:59.675 --> 07:03.859
Oh! Oh, Sonia. Oh.

07:04.176 --> 07:05.859
Oh, Sonia, fuck you're...

07:05.865 --> 07:08.049
Fuck you're a sight for
sore eyes, aren't you?!

07:08.055 --> 07:11.542
- You look good...!
- I don't respond well to disloyalty!

07:11.548 --> 07:14.816
- What? Well... w-w...
- Liquid nicotine?!

07:15.011 --> 07:16.568
In my tea!

07:17.336 --> 07:18.717
Oh, no.

07:18.723 --> 07:23.129
No, no, no. No. It wasn't me. Don't
believe them. Why would I do it?!

07:23.135 --> 07:25.603
I know you had ambitions
to take over the workshop.

07:25.609 --> 07:27.643
- I did not! I'm... I...
- Seems I was wasting my time

07:27.649 --> 07:29.968
nurturing someone I
thought had such promise,

07:29.974 --> 07:32.267
only to discover I'd created a monster.

07:32.273 --> 07:33.473
I'm not a Mon...!

07:33.754 --> 07:36.724
- I'm not a monster, I'm your partner!
- They charged you!

07:36.730 --> 07:38.774
Yeah, because I'm not a lagger!

07:40.341 --> 07:41.541
Nah...

07:45.216 --> 07:47.127
I wouldn't tell 'em who really done it.

07:50.730 --> 07:52.013
So it was Liz.

07:57.373 --> 07:58.573
Hey.

07:58.883 --> 08:00.083
Hey.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.812
- Who's winnin'?
- Me.

08:15.102 --> 08:16.302
Good luck.

08:16.650 --> 08:20.071
I don't need luck. I'm reigning champ.

08:40.839 --> 08:43.227
- You finished?
- Attention, compound. Attention, compound...

08:44.507 --> 08:47.047
- Vera wants to fire me.
- I don't blame her, Jake.

08:48.758 --> 08:51.187
You know if that happens,
who knows what I might do.

08:55.758 --> 08:56.958
Is that a threat?

08:57.346 --> 08:58.546
Listen, mate...

08:58.845 --> 09:00.245
we're in this together.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.539
You've joined the club now.

09:22.136 --> 09:24.326
It's not smart mixing with Kaz's crew.

09:25.922 --> 09:27.152
What's it to you?

09:27.158 --> 09:28.850
I know how it works
in here, she's Top Dog,

09:28.856 --> 09:31.327
- she'll use you to bash people.
- You don't know shit.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.150
Kaz's crew might be the safer option.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.750
I know this, if you lose it
again it could mean more time.

09:39.965 --> 09:41.588
And whose fault is that?

09:46.147 --> 09:48.171
You think I don't
remember what happened?

09:48.603 --> 09:49.803
I'm just saying.

09:50.602 --> 09:51.808
Well, go on.

09:51.814 --> 09:53.843
You done your lecture,
now you can fuck off!

09:55.618 --> 09:56.818
Nuh?

10:35.753 --> 10:36.953
Fuck!

10:56.725 --> 10:58.218
Shit!

10:59.444 --> 11:02.634
Ruby? Ruby? Ruby, can you hear me?

11:06.245 --> 11:07.464
It's okay.

11:07.602 --> 11:09.846
It's okay. I'm here now.

11:11.328 --> 11:13.047
Okay, here you go.

11:13.302 --> 11:16.733
That's it. That's it.
I got you. It's okay.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.371
- How often does this happen?
- Not that often.

11:25.236 --> 11:27.816
I... I still think you
should go to medical.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.414
I'm fine. Allie, it
looks worse than it is.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.851
Yeah, well, it looked pretty bad.

11:33.857 --> 11:36.369
Yeah, I know, right. But...

11:36.835 --> 11:38.035
you did good.

11:38.557 --> 11:40.058
Talking to me and that.

11:40.263 --> 11:42.049
- You hear me?
- Mm-hm.

11:42.055 --> 11:45.747
- All the stuff about my hot body.
- Oh, my gosh.

11:47.793 --> 11:49.769
But shouldn't you be on
some kind of medication

11:49.775 --> 11:51.889
- or something? Okay.
- I'm all good.

11:52.905 --> 11:55.203
Don't tell anybody about it, will ya?

11:55.216 --> 11:56.695
Not if you don't want me to.

11:57.074 --> 11:59.561
I just don't want people
thinking I'm weak...

11:59.924 --> 12:01.124
or weird.

12:32.374 --> 12:35.745
_

13:17.091 --> 13:18.291
You okay?

13:18.297 --> 13:19.576
I'm just knackered.

13:19.783 --> 13:21.986
- Because of the...
- It fucks you up a bit.

13:22.496 --> 13:23.815
- Mitchell...!
- Sorry.

13:23.821 --> 13:25.718
quit gasbagging, get
on with your folding.

13:25.724 --> 13:28.194
Oh, come on, Smiles. Give her
a break, she's on her rags.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.138
Yeah, so's have the
prison. Get on with it.

13:30.369 --> 13:31.569
Come on.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.192
You like each other?

13:40.198 --> 13:42.646
Yeah, she's a cool
chick. What's not to like?

13:42.850 --> 13:45.354
Wanna ask you a favour...
keep an eye on her.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.557
- Why?
- She's got problems.

13:47.563 --> 13:48.763
What problems?

13:48.769 --> 13:51.151
She's a good kid, but
if there's trouble...

13:51.361 --> 13:54.538
a short sentence could turn into a
long one, if you know what I mean.

13:54.544 --> 13:56.142
She could get jammed in here.

13:56.148 --> 13:58.339
- Why do you care?
- Family.

14:01.996 --> 14:03.571
Why don't you talk to her?

14:03.577 --> 14:07.804
She won't listen to me.
We've got, um... issues.

14:09.299 --> 14:10.499
W...

14:10.609 --> 14:12.428
what do you expect me to do?

14:12.434 --> 14:16.459
Look, I'm out on a limb here.
You seems like a decent person...

14:16.879 --> 14:19.247
- But, you don't even know me.
- As I said...

14:19.253 --> 14:20.453
out on a limb.

14:23.251 --> 14:26.061
She had an accident,
caused a brain injury.

14:26.906 --> 14:30.655
She can snap. Be a danger
to herself or others.

14:31.669 --> 14:33.279
It's already happened.

14:36.711 --> 14:37.911
Spike?!

14:38.294 --> 14:39.494
That was her?

14:39.571 --> 14:41.093
Please.

14:56.126 --> 14:57.563
Hey, hot stuff...

14:58.038 --> 14:59.837
you like punching shit, 'ey?

14:59.843 --> 15:01.439
Why, you wanna apply?

15:01.445 --> 15:03.728
Got something to show ya, after lunch.

15:04.225 --> 15:05.716
Juice'll come get ya.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.028
- You right?
- Ooh!

15:15.375 --> 15:17.288
Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

15:17.534 --> 15:19.401
- Let me take that for ya.
- Oh,

15:19.407 --> 15:21.614
but hang on, what about
your hand, is it better?

15:21.899 --> 15:23.962
Well, it doesn't need stitches.

15:24.625 --> 15:25.825
Where ya sittin'?

15:26.114 --> 15:28.611
- I'm just over there, thanks.
- All right.

15:28.738 --> 15:31.327
Hey, Kaz, I've been talking to Ruby.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.849
- She's only got six months left.
- Half her luck.

15:35.007 --> 15:38.428
You're not thinking of
using her as muscle, are you?

15:38.738 --> 15:40.037
No. Why?

15:40.525 --> 15:43.850
Oh, I... I dunno, I just... Forget it.

15:43.959 --> 15:45.341
It's like that, is it?

15:45.553 --> 15:46.753
Like what?

15:46.759 --> 15:48.019
You've got a thing for her.

15:48.025 --> 15:49.500
What? No!

15:49.812 --> 15:51.012
You sure?

15:51.018 --> 15:53.108
Uh... I'm sure I'm sure.

15:54.771 --> 15:55.986
What?!

15:55.992 --> 15:59.420
Just know that you are a sweet,
intelligent, wonderful woman,

15:59.426 --> 16:01.182
and I'm sure that Bea...

16:01.977 --> 16:04.502
would want you to get on with your life.

16:04.629 --> 16:06.446
Just be happy, okay?

16:06.452 --> 16:09.280
No sweat about Ruby. I won't
get her into any trouble.

16:13.225 --> 16:15.742
Sonia! Welcome back!

16:16.193 --> 16:18.400
- Woo!
- Onya, Sonia!

16:18.566 --> 16:20.311
Glad to be back!

16:20.317 --> 16:21.906
What, the prison beats hospital then?

16:21.912 --> 16:23.211
Food's better here.

16:23.217 --> 16:25.012
What, were they feeding you poison?

16:25.851 --> 16:27.424
Somebody was.

16:27.430 --> 16:29.029
I still can't believe that Booms

16:29.035 --> 16:30.838
- would turn like that.
- Well she didn't.

16:31.148 --> 16:32.351
'Ey!

16:32.989 --> 16:34.573
Don't fuckin' look at her again!

16:34.579 --> 16:36.465
- Look at that fuckin' black bitch again
- I wasn't!

16:36.471 --> 16:38.274
- and I'll fuckin' stab you in the fuckin'...
- Hey!

16:38.280 --> 16:40.370
- All right, Baxter, settle down, please.
- Settled!

16:40.376 --> 16:41.576
- Are we sure?
- Yes!

16:41.582 --> 16:43.277
Don't let it happen again.

16:44.284 --> 16:46.205
Don't worry, Mr J, it's just foreplay.

16:46.211 --> 16:47.411
You wouldn't know about it.

16:47.417 --> 16:48.794
- Fuck off!
- Busted!

16:52.488 --> 16:53.802
Could you go any slower?

16:53.808 --> 16:55.008
What the fuck is this?

16:56.954 --> 16:58.154
_

17:11.594 --> 17:13.884
- Really cool, hey?
- Yeah, if you're a meathead.

17:13.890 --> 17:15.688
Those meatheads are getting rich.

17:16.695 --> 17:19.998
See that? We're streaming it on
the Dark Web. Make some real money.

17:20.003 --> 17:21.990
Who's gonna pay to watch
these fuckin' hacks?

17:21.996 --> 17:24.309
Real prison fight, are
you kidding? Everyone.

17:24.315 --> 17:25.589
If you say so.

17:25.713 --> 17:28.196
Hey, you've got some moves,
reckon you could do any better?

17:28.203 --> 17:30.201
Ooh, honey, I'd wipe the floor with 'em.

17:30.207 --> 17:32.082
Fuckin' do it then,
for a cut of the bets.

17:32.088 --> 17:34.105
Nuh. Not a street fighter.

17:34.788 --> 17:37.082
- Missin' out.
- Yeah, I'm gutted.

17:37.574 --> 17:40.506
You breathe a word about Fight
Club to Kaz, you will be gutted...

17:40.512 --> 17:41.712
with a shiv.

17:42.768 --> 17:44.096
Get the fuck off me!

17:53.786 --> 17:54.986
Hm.

18:22.795 --> 18:25.795
_

20:06.583 --> 20:08.083
Hmm.

21:17.968 --> 21:21.635
Attention, compound,
this is a Code Black.

21:21.641 --> 21:26.448
Code Black. All prisoners return
to their units immediately.

21:26.749 --> 21:29.959
I repeat, this is a Code Black.

21:30.153 --> 21:33.979
All prisoners return to
their units immediately.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.214
Do you know what's happened?

21:38.220 --> 21:39.420
Something bad.

21:39.493 --> 21:41.117
What's Code Black?

21:41.390 --> 21:42.819
Someone's dead.

21:42.825 --> 21:45.002
Oh, how dreadful.

21:45.285 --> 21:46.485
Do we know who?

21:46.993 --> 21:49.945
Okay, ladies, line up for the count.

21:55.857 --> 21:57.357
...staff from Security Limited

21:57.363 --> 21:59.676
say such a daring escape
from Wentworth Prison

21:59.682 --> 22:02.591
was attempted by following a
suspect from one of the rooms.

22:02.597 --> 22:05.256
29 year-old, Francesca Doyle...

22:05.265 --> 22:07.333
has been spotted
outside a convenience...

22:09.331 --> 22:13.027
- If you're looking for Franky, she's not here.
- No, I'm not. What happened to your leg?

22:13.307 --> 22:14.507
Oh...

22:14.703 --> 22:16.932
stupid accident. I, uh...

22:17.368 --> 22:18.724
slipped down the stairs.

22:18.730 --> 22:20.325
You poor thing.

22:20.331 --> 22:21.992
Look, I'm sorry.

22:21.998 --> 22:24.055
I had to give the police
the visitors log book.

22:24.061 --> 22:26.127
I hope it didn't create too
much of a problem for you.

22:26.133 --> 22:29.103
Oh, well they came, they
searched, and they went.

22:29.290 --> 22:30.972
I've been scanning the news.

22:30.978 --> 22:32.480
- Still no word?
- No.

22:35.472 --> 22:37.572
I'm here to ask for your advice.

22:39.785 --> 22:41.748
What a snake.

22:42.952 --> 22:44.995
I can handle the blackmail...

22:46.071 --> 22:48.185
and the betrayal, but I...

22:50.146 --> 22:51.894
I never expected...

22:54.264 --> 22:55.594
I, um...

22:55.600 --> 22:57.013
I'm pregnant.

22:58.867 --> 23:00.067
To Jake?

23:03.066 --> 23:04.878
Do you want to have a child?

23:07.500 --> 23:09.195
When I was younger, I...

23:10.008 --> 23:12.618
always used to dream of...

23:13.388 --> 23:16.609
having a baby that I could love
and it would love me, and...

23:16.615 --> 23:19.431
and I stopped thinking it
would ever happen, and now...

23:19.944 --> 23:22.254
- Now it's a reality.
- I don't know.

23:22.349 --> 23:23.549
I don't know.

23:23.555 --> 23:24.930
Do you want to have Jake's baby?

23:24.936 --> 23:27.134
I don't want him in
my life or the child's.

23:28.206 --> 23:29.775
So, um...

23:30.142 --> 23:31.659
how many weeks are you?

23:32.493 --> 23:33.802
Five, I think.

23:33.808 --> 23:35.997
So you don't have to make
a decision immediately.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.786
I guess I could wait a week or two.

23:39.299 --> 23:42.635
The most important thing is
not to make a hasty decision.

23:42.641 --> 23:46.032
And look, whatever grounds
you find to fire Jake,

23:46.038 --> 23:49.755
just make sure you dot all the i's
and cross all the t's, because...

23:50.056 --> 23:51.857
he is the type...

23:51.945 --> 23:54.407
that could accuse you
of sexual harassment.

23:54.909 --> 23:56.290
Oh, f...!

24:01.988 --> 24:03.194
It's work.

24:03.789 --> 24:04.995
Yes?

24:10.371 --> 24:12.544
That's okay. Like 28, two...

24:12.735 --> 24:14.344
- Thanks.
- Okay, thanks.

24:18.394 --> 24:19.594
Hey.

24:20.063 --> 24:21.264
Are you okay?

24:21.270 --> 24:23.682
Yeah. Is there anything
on the, uh, corridor CCTV?

24:24.270 --> 24:26.168
Ah, the camera was tampered with.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.270
- Okay. Toss every, uh, cell for the weapon.
- Okay.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.761
And on to news now, where
a manhunt for two prisoners

25:25.767 --> 25:29.042
who escaped from Wentworth
Correctional Facility continues.

25:29.048 --> 25:31.513
Police are no closer
to recapturing the pair,

25:31.519 --> 25:34.441
despite a sighting of the
notorious Franky Doyle,

25:34.447 --> 25:38.035
reportedly seen outside a convenience
store in Carlton, yesterday.

25:38.041 --> 25:42.080
Disgraced former Governor, Joan
Ferguson, also remains on the run

25:42.086 --> 25:46.076
from charges including the fatal
stabbing of inmate, Bea Smith.

25:46.082 --> 25:49.073
Ferguson had been an inmate
at the Wentworth facility,

25:49.079 --> 25:50.752
awaiting trial on charges

25:50.758 --> 25:52.489
- of conspiracy to murder.
- _

25:52.495 --> 25:55.878
29 year-old, Doyle, is
facing two murder charges,

25:55.884 --> 25:57.543
- for the shooting death of celebrity
- _

25:57.549 --> 25:59.509
- TV chef, Mike Pennisi,
- _

25:59.515 --> 26:02.207
- and the brutal slaying of her fellow inmate,
- _

26:02.213 --> 26:03.636
Iman Farah.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.096
In other news, a Noble Park man

26:06.102 --> 26:08.263
is facing a string of
sexual assault charges...

26:08.269 --> 26:10.760
Don't do this to me now. Come on!

26:11.754 --> 26:14.653
...the assaults, which are believed
to have taken place between

26:14.659 --> 26:17.026
November last year
and February this year,

26:17.032 --> 26:20.145
- occurred close to several Metropolitan train stations,
- _

26:20.151 --> 26:24.333
including Greenvale, Clayton,
Noble Park and Dandenong.

26:24.339 --> 26:25.648
Hey, is that Zoe Taylor?

26:25.654 --> 26:27.218
Hey, a friend of mine gave
me your number. I'm, um,

26:27.224 --> 26:29.764
havin' some problems and I
wanted to make an appointment.

26:30.541 --> 26:32.017
Yeah, it's, uh...

26:32.414 --> 26:33.807
Jenny Blake.

26:33.949 --> 26:35.149
Great, thanks.

26:39.805 --> 26:42.006
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

26:42.012 --> 26:44.417
H Block are now called to breakfast.

26:44.423 --> 26:46.526
I wasn't even able to have
a shower today because of it.

26:46.532 --> 26:48.424
Do you know how clean the showers are?

26:49.323 --> 26:51.243
She wasn't in her cell last night.

26:52.037 --> 26:53.237
Fuck!

26:53.295 --> 26:54.715
Okay, go have your breakfast.

26:54.721 --> 26:55.921
I hope they get to the bottom of it

26:55.927 --> 26:57.223
- sooner than later. I can't
- Fuck off!

26:57.229 --> 27:00.223
wash my hair. Can't use the
shower. Ludicrous really.

27:00.229 --> 27:01.926
Does anyone know who died?!

27:01.932 --> 27:03.597
Screws are keeping it under wraps.

27:04.659 --> 27:06.040
- What?
- Hold on.

27:06.046 --> 27:07.577
We think it could be Liz.

27:08.511 --> 27:09.853
No. Why?

27:09.907 --> 27:12.518
Well, she didn't come back
for lockdown last night

27:12.524 --> 27:14.526
and she wasn't around
for morning count either.

27:14.532 --> 27:16.218
I'll find out from Smiles where she is.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.263
Jesus, Liz!

27:21.269 --> 27:22.514
Where have you been?

27:22.520 --> 27:25.204
- God, we were worried about you.
- Oh, but I'm so sorry, love,

27:25.210 --> 27:26.901
but I was in medical
when they called lockdown

27:26.907 --> 27:29.800
- and then they only just decided to let me out.
- Why were you in there?

27:30.399 --> 27:32.789
Oh, I had... had a headache so I...

27:32.795 --> 27:35.004
- had to go and get some tablets, so I...
- You killed Sharon!

27:35.010 --> 27:36.985
You fucking killed Sharon!

27:36.991 --> 27:38.413
- You great fuck! You...
- Hey! Hey!

27:38.419 --> 27:40.104
- Fuckin' never!
- Fuck no!

27:40.110 --> 27:41.310
What the fuck?!

27:41.316 --> 27:42.516
Come on!

27:42.640 --> 27:44.714
Damn you! Fuck!

27:45.321 --> 27:47.631
- Yeah, come on.
- Fuck you!

27:47.637 --> 27:48.837
What ya gonna do about it?!

27:48.843 --> 27:50.918
- You asked me, you Nazi bitch!
- I know you did it!

27:50.924 --> 27:53.131
- Come on! Come on! Settle down.
- You fucking did!

27:53.307 --> 27:54.507
Come on!

27:55.762 --> 27:59.777
Well, that solves the
mystery of who died.

28:06.274 --> 28:08.099
Oh, what the fuck?!

28:08.494 --> 28:10.420
D... do you know anything?

28:10.912 --> 28:13.898
How could I? I've been
in lockdown for 13 hours!

28:14.074 --> 28:15.922
There's a psycho among you.

28:15.970 --> 28:17.478
28 stab wounds!

28:17.484 --> 28:19.597
- Jesus!
- What about Mitchell?

28:20.776 --> 28:22.866
Wasn't Ruby, she was with
Allie when it happened.

28:22.872 --> 28:24.072
Okay...

28:24.367 --> 28:25.664
but be careful.

28:25.890 --> 28:28.707
And if you find out
anything... leave it to us.

28:29.586 --> 28:32.623
I'm only doing this shit
to be ready for Ferguson.

28:32.629 --> 28:35.695
- She won't be back.
- Bullshit! They all get caught sooner or later.

28:35.701 --> 28:38.709
- I promise you, Ferguson’s gone.
- Yeah, right.

28:38.715 --> 28:39.915
Kaz...

28:41.760 --> 28:43.373
she's not coming back.

28:45.076 --> 28:46.276
What do you mean?

29:03.908 --> 29:06.490
Yes, sir. We are working
closely with the police on this.

29:06.496 --> 29:08.005
We should have some answers soon. We...

29:09.132 --> 29:10.466
No, sir. We've given them all

29:10.472 --> 29:12.303
the information we
have on the escapees.

29:16.303 --> 29:17.725
Ah, Governor, you got a moment?

29:17.731 --> 29:18.931
What do you want?

29:31.685 --> 29:33.213
Is this more blackmail?

29:33.421 --> 29:34.621
I'm done.

29:36.403 --> 29:39.759
I can't do this anymore, Vera.
You've go enough on your plate, and...

29:42.235 --> 29:43.435
it's killing me.

29:44.249 --> 29:46.315
You're free to do what you need to do.

29:47.249 --> 29:48.449
Sack me.

30:17.508 --> 30:20.719
You killed the wrong
person, ya fuckin' psycho!

30:20.725 --> 30:22.902
- Liz, Liz, Liz...
- No, no, don't you come near me

30:22.908 --> 30:24.156
or I'll shiv ya!

30:24.162 --> 30:25.743
W-what has gotten into you?

30:25.749 --> 30:28.872
You killed Sharon, thinkin'
it was me, didn't ya?

30:28.878 --> 30:30.160
Oh, don't be ridiculous,

30:30.166 --> 30:31.557
Blind Freddy could
tell you she's at least

30:31.563 --> 30:33.845
- 10 years younger.
- Oh, cut the bullshit, Sonia!

30:33.960 --> 30:37.063
Have you forgotten that
you threatened to kill me?!

30:37.465 --> 30:39.864
What did you expect?
You lagged on me.

30:40.253 --> 30:42.707
You wanted me to make
that fuckin' confession.

30:42.713 --> 30:44.729
You colluded with Don to make it happen!

30:44.735 --> 30:47.706
And you made it so
easy. Nobody forced you.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.403
It was Don.

30:49.409 --> 30:52.418
That was not my idea. That
was... that was all Don.

30:52.424 --> 30:53.724
Right? He...

30:54.471 --> 30:55.671
He...

30:57.486 --> 31:00.796
He promised me things. He...

31:01.996 --> 31:07.090
No, he made me believe that...
that we had a future to-together.

31:08.281 --> 31:12.219
Fuckin' reeled me in,
hook, line and sinker.

31:13.515 --> 31:15.339
He's as corrupt as they come.

31:22.144 --> 31:23.344
Yes.

31:23.547 --> 31:26.353
You're right. He was.

31:27.475 --> 31:31.301
He was as corrupt as they come.

31:32.187 --> 31:34.242
He was corrupt.

31:43.415 --> 31:45.076
- Hey, Mitchell.
- Hey.

31:45.082 --> 31:47.522
Novak's lookin' for
ya... in the laundry.

31:47.528 --> 31:50.242
Yeah? Cool, thanks.

31:50.581 --> 31:52.970
- What do youse want?
- There's a line, hurry up!

31:53.284 --> 31:55.073
All right. All right. That's enough.

32:03.754 --> 32:05.094
Oh!

32:05.672 --> 32:06.872
Where's Allie?

32:12.369 --> 32:13.569
Fuck!

32:13.681 --> 32:14.881
It's you and her.

32:16.258 --> 32:17.746
In your dreams.

32:18.872 --> 32:20.436
Come on, ladies.

32:20.442 --> 32:22.981
Greenslade! Greenslade!

32:22.987 --> 32:26.772
- Greenslade! Greenslade! Greenslade!
- Come on, hot stuff!

32:26.778 --> 32:27.978
Grunts.

32:28.968 --> 32:30.997
- Fuck!
- 20 on Greenslade.

32:38.702 --> 32:40.857
- Oh!
- Cheeky little bugger, hey?

32:45.399 --> 32:46.769
Huh! Agh!

32:53.054 --> 32:55.239
- Ha-ha!
- What's going on?

32:55.245 --> 32:57.388
- Fight club!
- Fight club!

32:57.675 --> 32:58.875
Huh!

33:02.215 --> 33:03.509
Ha-ha-ha!

33:05.215 --> 33:06.415
Huh, oof!

33:06.651 --> 33:07.833
Argh!

33:07.839 --> 33:10.138
Come on! Punch her!

33:16.080 --> 33:17.286
Oof!

33:19.527 --> 33:20.727
Ha!

33:40.496 --> 33:41.696
Yes!

33:41.702 --> 33:43.233
And the winner is...!

33:43.535 --> 33:45.198
Oh!

33:46.703 --> 33:49.999
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!

33:50.005 --> 33:51.319
- Fuck!
- Yeah!

33:51.325 --> 33:53.528
Ruby! Ruby!

33:55.013 --> 34:00.408
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!

34:04.660 --> 34:08.040
That was fucking incredible!

34:08.143 --> 34:09.975
Thanks. You're pretty good yourself.

34:14.918 --> 34:16.934
You know... you're probably too good

34:16.940 --> 34:18.926
- for fight club.
- What do you mean?

34:18.931 --> 34:21.164
- You could really hurt someone.
- Oh, come on, Allie,

34:21.170 --> 34:23.664
- I know what I'm doing.
- No, but I mean if you had a snap.

34:24.061 --> 34:25.261
Like with Spike.

34:25.774 --> 34:27.496
Fuckin' Rita!

34:28.190 --> 34:29.672
I can't believe she told you that.

34:29.678 --> 34:31.449
Hey, no, she was just
concerned about you.

34:31.455 --> 34:34.409
- She just told me to...
- Wanted you to what?! Huh?!

34:34.672 --> 34:36.458
Oh, I see, you're only
hanging out with me

34:36.464 --> 34:38.384
- because my fuckin' sister told you to.
- Whoa!

34:38.389 --> 34:39.755
- That... that's not...
- Are we even friends?!

34:39.761 --> 34:40.960
Fuck you, Allie!

34:41.253 --> 34:42.455
Fuck!

34:42.770 --> 34:43.969
Fuck!

34:44.775 --> 34:46.022
Fuck!

34:46.027 --> 34:49.797
- Hey, Ruby, what the fuck?
- Let me tell you about my fuckin' sister,

34:49.803 --> 34:51.097
she ruined my life!

34:51.103 --> 34:53.275
She took everything away from me!

34:53.281 --> 34:55.945
I was smart, I was
gonna fuckin' study...

34:55.951 --> 34:58.256
and she fucked that
up for me, didn't she?!

34:58.555 --> 35:00.023
All I have is boxing,

35:00.029 --> 35:02.039
and it's the most important
thing in the world to me!

35:02.045 --> 35:06.561
I'm not gonna let Rita take
that away, too! You got that?!

35:06.749 --> 35:08.051
You're hurting me.

35:08.447 --> 35:11.188
You can report that
back to my fuckin' sister!

35:23.667 --> 35:25.199
I don't want you to go.

35:27.976 --> 35:29.176
Listen...

35:29.802 --> 35:33.921
after what's happened, me staying
would bring trouble to the family.

35:34.223 --> 35:35.423
Someone's died.

35:36.291 --> 35:38.119

38:13.919 --> 38:15.652
and please don’t tell me Sonia did it.

38:15.658 --> 38:18.148
Yes... Sonia...

38:20.125 --> 38:23.251
I've-I've come to explain...
about the poisoning.

38:23.351 --> 38:24.970
Th-there's an innocent
person in the slot,

38:24.976 --> 38:26.183
- Ms Bennett. I can't...
- Oh, Liz!

38:26.367 --> 38:28.789
- Boomer...
- Oh, no. I know, the...

38:28.835 --> 38:31.137
Sonia's made a statement
to the police already.

38:31.143 --> 38:33.372
It was a misguided suicide attempt.

38:35.227 --> 38:36.427
Who...?

38:36.433 --> 38:38.831
A s... suicide attempt? She...

38:39.211 --> 38:41.622
She said... that?

38:41.628 --> 38:44.723
So, w-why... why would Sonia...?

38:44.729 --> 38:47.032
Well, no, apparently she was
depressed about entering a

38:47.038 --> 38:50.581
guilty please and she... swallowed
the liquid nicotine herself.

38:51.153 --> 38:52.891
- Right.
- So...

38:53.470 --> 38:56.100
you can rest assured.
Jenkins is off the hook.

38:59.283 --> 39:00.698
- Liz?
- Hmm?

39:03.161 --> 39:04.657
Liz, how are you feeling?

39:04.663 --> 39:07.919
- Me?! Oh, god, I'm fine. Yeah.
- Mmm.

39:08.282 --> 39:11.687
Nurse Radcliffe said you wandered
into Medical looking for the showers?

39:11.693 --> 39:14.758
Oh, yeah. Look, I-I think I
was just havin' a bit of a...

39:14.764 --> 39:16.763
bit of a "senior moment".

39:16.874 --> 39:18.472
I hope you're not drinking again.

39:18.941 --> 39:20.890
No, Ms Bennett.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.962
God, no, not anymore.

39:23.294 --> 39:24.494
Okay.

39:25.700 --> 39:27.090
- Good.
- Mmm.

39:48.260 --> 39:49.585
Oh, Booms...

39:49.591 --> 39:51.334
- didn't know what to tell you, love...
- You frickin'...!

39:56.267 --> 40:00.132
Booms, let go. Let go now. Let go.

40:00.138 --> 40:02.339
L-let go now. Come on.

40:02.345 --> 40:03.708
- Ah-ha!
- Because...

40:08.930 --> 40:11.099
You are a fuckin' arsehole!

40:12.575 --> 40:15.020
Y-y-you...

40:15.026 --> 40:16.226
Now, lovey, you...

40:16.814 --> 40:18.615
you need to listen to me...

40:18.936 --> 40:20.136
okay?

40:20.426 --> 40:24.634
Now, I know you're hurt and you're
angry because I let you down...

40:24.640 --> 40:26.221
but that bitch...

40:26.512 --> 40:28.057
set me up...

40:28.126 --> 40:30.133
and she tried to kill me.

40:30.139 --> 40:33.715
She's not who she
pretends, love, she's not!

40:34.139 --> 40:35.743
She used me...

40:36.537 --> 40:38.656
and she's using you, Boomer.

40:40.344 --> 40:41.871
No, don't laugh.

40:42.149 --> 40:44.184
It's not funny, lovey.

40:45.690 --> 40:47.430
Well, is that all you've got?

40:48.507 --> 40:51.285
Wh-wh-wh-what, you're not gonna
pull your little fuckin' hairs out?!

40:51.291 --> 40:55.165
Get on the floor, rock like
a little fuckin' retard, 'ey?

40:55.522 --> 41:00.334
Oh, I'm fucked! I fucked up!

41:00.538 --> 41:02.645
'Cause that was really good, that was.

41:03.166 --> 41:06.170
Yeah, you really got me with
one. I actually believed ya.

41:11.540 --> 41:13.932
You're a sneaky fuckin' liar.

41:18.228 --> 41:20.431
Don't... don't say that.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.200
Susan.

41:34.089 --> 41:35.536
You all right?

41:45.976 --> 41:48.555
I need you to be all right, Liz...

41:48.561 --> 41:51.685
because you're crucial
to my new defence.

41:53.658 --> 41:55.557
It was your idea.

41:55.884 --> 41:57.180
Corruption.

41:57.186 --> 41:59.978
Listen, I've sacked my
lawyer, I've changed my plea.

41:59.984 --> 42:03.006
Come on, keep up, Liz,
pay attention. Come on now.

42:04.079 --> 42:07.004
Once they catch him... and they will...

42:07.895 --> 42:14.543
you and I are gonna out Don Kaplan
for his despicable corruption.

42:15.797 --> 42:19.125
And that will be the
basis for my exoneration.

42:22.428 --> 42:25.280
- Don's alive?
- Yep.

42:27.055 --> 42:29.252
Oh, fuck!

42:37.466 --> 42:38.979
Just come through, Jenny.

42:43.775 --> 42:46.470
So, who was the friend who referred you?

42:46.775 --> 42:48.079
An acquaintance.

42:48.476 --> 42:49.890
Iman Farah.

42:52.237 --> 42:53.776
Please, have a seat.

42:58.539 --> 43:00.139
Have you seen me before?

43:01.092 --> 43:03.411
- Nuh.
- Under another name, perhaps?

43:03.417 --> 43:04.904
Course not, would have said.

43:05.799 --> 43:08.280
Yeah, it's just you look quite familiar.

43:10.617 --> 43:12.017
I'm Franky Doyle.

43:12.746 --> 43:14.459
You might have seen me on the news.

43:14.950 --> 43:16.753
I escaped from Wentworth.

43:17.377 --> 43:19.430
Now, I'm riskin' everything
to come and talk to ya,

43:19.436 --> 43:21.355
because my life is at stake.

43:21.644 --> 43:23.799
I didn't kill Pennisi or Iman.

43:24.431 --> 43:25.631
_

43:33.885 --> 43:35.396
You haven't fired me yet.

43:35.776 --> 43:37.387
Does that mean there's a chance for us?

43:38.599 --> 43:42.403
If you think returning the USB
would make me melt, you're an idiot.

43:42.409 --> 43:44.834
- Vera...
- Shut up. I haven't got time for your drivel.

43:44.840 --> 43:46.796
I've got two escaped
prisoners and one murdered.

43:46.802 --> 43:48.319
The only reason

43:48.325 --> 43:51.815
I haven't fired you yet is
because I am too fucking exhausted

43:51.821 --> 43:54.251
to deal with the bureaucratic bullshit.

43:55.917 --> 43:57.117
_

44:09.190 --> 44:10.390
Fuck!

44:12.268 --> 44:14.888
Relax. You did good.

44:15.055 --> 44:17.168
The women love you,
you're their new star.

44:18.102 --> 44:19.681
I told you, I'm not interested.

44:19.745 --> 44:21.825
I'm not gonna get sucked
into this shit again.

44:22.169 --> 44:23.369
Here's your cut.

44:24.371 --> 44:27.238
You earned it and there's
plenty more where that came from.

44:30.587 --> 44:32.171
What, the Dark Web?

44:32.265 --> 44:34.059
Come back any time.

44:52.959 --> 44:55.250
Whatever I may or may not have been told

44:55.256 --> 44:57.442
by any of my clients is confidential.

44:57.448 --> 44:59.551
I've read Iman's files.

44:59.557 --> 45:02.147
I know she spoke to you
about Pennisi's murder.

45:02.153 --> 45:04.185
All that stuff about grief and guilt.

45:04.191 --> 45:07.582
- How did you do that?
- If she confessed to you I need to know.

45:10.899 --> 45:13.703
Iman and I discussed
her perennial problem...

45:13.709 --> 45:16.485
survivor guilt. She
didn't confess to murder.

45:16.491 --> 45:19.031
If she had, it would be my
professional responsibility

45:19.037 --> 45:20.855
to take that information to the police.

45:20.861 --> 45:22.824
If she said anything
to you that could be

45:22.830 --> 45:26.274
construed as an admission of guilt,
please... just please tell me.

45:26.591 --> 45:28.897
'Cause Iman's dead, but
I'm in a living hell.

45:28.903 --> 45:31.387
And even if she didn't
confess to you outright,

45:31.393 --> 45:33.716
you must have had your
suspicions about her.

45:33.722 --> 45:35.300
She was unstable.

45:35.306 --> 45:38.203
She was potentially
dangerous and you did nothing.

45:38.209 --> 45:41.141
You inaction resulted
the deaths of two people.

45:41.353 --> 45:43.341
Do you think about that when
you're sleepin' at night?

45:43.347 --> 45:46.934
I think you're projecting your
own feelings of guilt onto me.

45:46.940 --> 45:50.466
- In psychology we call that...
- Yeah, transference. I know all about that shit.

45:50.472 --> 45:52.264
I know your feel guilty.

45:52.270 --> 45:53.964
How could you not have seen it coming?

45:53.970 --> 45:56.065
And even after Pennisi's death

45:56.071 --> 45:59.216
it was easier for you to let
an innocent person go to jail,

45:59.222 --> 46:01.623
rather than admit you'd
failed professionally!

46:01.629 --> 46:03.430
Oh, that's enough. I
think you should leave.

46:03.436 --> 46:05.430
This is your once chance to make amends.

46:05.436 --> 46:08.407
You need to tell the cops
what you suspected about Iman.

46:10.700 --> 46:12.549
You need to get out of here...

46:13.062 --> 46:14.262
now.

46:16.244 --> 46:17.803
The police are on their way.

46:19.586 --> 46:21.183
Shit!

46:30.628 --> 46:31.828
Fuck!

46:33.261 --> 46:36.002
Dispatch, this is Unit 6, we
are in pursuit of suspect...

46:45.390 --> 46:46.590
Fuck!

46:53.375 --> 46:55.725
Shit, it's Franky Doyle! Call it in!

46:55.884 --> 46:57.701
Franky Doyle, stop and give yourself up!

47:00.446 --> 47:01.914
Franky Doyle, stop!

47:02.932 --> 47:04.257
I said stop!

47:04.425 --> 47:06.981
I will fire if you don't stop!
