WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.494
I know you think I'm crazy.

00:03.820 --> 00:05.162
But it's not me.

00:05.781 --> 00:07.064
It's the world.

00:07.699 --> 00:09.233
The world's gone mad.

00:10.028 --> 00:11.527
Because...

00:11.563 --> 00:13.497
because Martians have invaded, but...

00:14.065 --> 00:15.874
nobody seems to care!

00:16.917 --> 00:18.710
Take it easy, mister.

00:19.537 --> 00:21.046
Have a cup of joe.

00:24.743 --> 00:25.995
I can't take it easy.

00:26.611 --> 00:28.303
I just saw one outside.

00:28.505 --> 00:30.372
So, uh, tell me,

00:30.541 --> 00:32.641
what do these Martians look like?

00:32.830 --> 00:35.918
They... have giant heads

00:35.954 --> 00:37.707
and multiple appendages.

00:37.743 --> 00:39.064
Yikes.

00:39.143 --> 00:41.377
And they're, uh,
here to eat us or something?

00:41.412 --> 00:44.714
No. They have a ray of some kind...

00:45.112 --> 00:46.382
that makes us...

00:47.156 --> 00:48.384
forget.

00:48.740 --> 00:49.852
Forget what?

00:50.989 --> 00:52.989
- There! I just saw one.
- Where?

00:53.024 --> 00:55.057
Outside through that window.
I just saw one of 'em.

00:55.093 --> 00:57.460
Hey, mister.

00:57.495 --> 01:00.830
That ain't a window. That's a mirror.

01:21.452 --> 01:22.985
What is this,

01:23.021 --> 01:25.588
some kind of sick joke, Buddy?

01:25.623 --> 01:29.992
Oh, it's no joke.

01:32.797 --> 01:35.297
And my name's not Buddy.

01:35.333 --> 01:37.767
Wait, what?!

02:23.912 --> 02:25.278
Hello.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.280
Mulder, it's me. Where have you been?

02:27.315 --> 02:28.948
I've been trying your cell all day.

02:28.984 --> 02:30.416
I was out squatchin'.

02:30.452 --> 02:31.818
- What?
- Bigfoot hunting.

02:31.853 --> 02:33.486
I had my phone turned off.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.988
Did you have any luck?

02:35.023 --> 02:37.624
No, but that's not really the point.

02:37.659 --> 02:40.827
I just had to get away from
the madness for a little while.

02:40.862 --> 02:43.963
It seems this past year
all I've done is watch the news

02:43.999 --> 02:46.232
and worry that the country's gone insane.

02:46.268 --> 02:48.668
I had to get out to nature.

02:48.703 --> 02:50.270
You know, where it's simple
and uncomplicated,

02:50.305 --> 02:52.238
where it's just you and the elements.

02:52.698 --> 02:55.341
And possibly
a cryptozoological, simian-like,

02:55.377 --> 02:57.653
hairy humanoid with enormous feet.

02:57.688 --> 02:59.946
I think you just like
saying "squatchin'."

02:59.981 --> 03:01.514
We still on for dinner tomorrow night?

03:01.549 --> 03:02.982
Yeah, I'll see you then.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.251
Hey, Scully,
I ever tell you about the time

03:05.287 --> 03:07.084
I found a Sasquatch footprint in the mud?

03:07.119 --> 03:09.355
- Yeah, you did. I, uh...
- It was 35 years ago, about.

03:09.391 --> 03:11.591
- Mulder, I've heard this before.
- On the banks

03:11.626 --> 03:13.660
- of the mighty Mogoagogo River
- Mulder, you already told me.

03:13.695 --> 03:15.261
- I got to go, got to go, Mulder.
- In beautiful British Columbia.

03:15.297 --> 03:18.197
Scully? Scully?

03:53.034 --> 03:54.634
Mulder.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.035
It's me.

03:56.071 --> 03:57.704
Now, I-I know you're surprised to see me.

03:57.739 --> 03:59.706
I thought we were all done after...

03:59.741 --> 04:01.307
you know, that last case.

04:02.017 --> 04:04.043
I've stumbled on the conspiracy to...

04:05.080 --> 04:07.022
...to end all conspiracies.

04:08.359 --> 04:09.670
Who are you?

04:12.152 --> 04:14.112
So they have already gotten to you.

04:14.956 --> 04:17.857
How did you know how
to contact me? To meet me here?

04:17.892 --> 04:20.326
I... It had to be someplace safe.

04:20.362 --> 04:21.577
They...

04:22.263 --> 04:25.198
they'd kill us if they had the chance.

04:25.233 --> 04:26.599
And who are "they"?

04:26.634 --> 04:28.919
They are why you don't remember.

04:29.150 --> 04:31.738
Why aren't people getting probed
by aliens anymore?

04:31.773 --> 04:33.940
You used to know,
but they made you forget...

04:33.975 --> 04:36.609
so that you wouldn't remember me.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.444
Look, what is this all about?

04:38.480 --> 04:41.280
Oh, my God. Look, there's no way
for me to make you understand

04:41.316 --> 04:43.349
without me seeming like a crazed madman.

04:43.385 --> 04:45.351
It's a little late for that.

04:49.324 --> 04:51.224
I think your ride is here.

04:52.394 --> 04:54.127
The first Twilight Zone episode

04:54.162 --> 04:55.895
you ever saw... it was
"The Lost Martian," right?

04:55.930 --> 04:57.930
You remember that?

04:58.490 --> 04:59.766
And if I do?

04:59.801 --> 05:02.235
That Twilight Zone episode...

05:02.661 --> 05:04.270
doesn't exist.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.305
It never did.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.412
Were you followed?

05:13.415 --> 05:15.048
Who is that?

05:17.519 --> 05:19.318
It would be a hell of a twist

05:19.354 --> 05:21.254
if it were Rod Serling.

05:30.999 --> 05:33.316
Submitted for your approval.

05:35.777 --> 05:38.604
No, it's not in here, either.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.239
Mulder, what I don't understand

05:40.275 --> 05:42.675
is how this guy knew

05:42.710 --> 05:44.277
about your secret rendezvous signal.

05:44.312 --> 05:45.745
Who cares about any of that, Scully?

05:45.780 --> 05:47.513
I can't find "The Lost Martian."

05:47.549 --> 05:49.482
Wh-When he said that that episode

05:49.517 --> 05:51.184
of The Twilight Zone didn't exist,

05:51.219 --> 05:53.619
that's when I knew he was
a crazy person. It's a classic.

05:53.655 --> 05:55.287
So I came home, and I checked

05:55.322 --> 05:57.156
my box DVD set, and it wasn't on there.

05:57.192 --> 05:58.858
I checked all my episode guidebooks.

05:58.893 --> 06:00.026
No mention of it.

06:00.061 --> 06:02.462
I searched online. Nothing.

06:02.497 --> 06:04.497
So now I'm going through
my tapes because I'm sure

06:04.532 --> 06:06.132
I recorded it at some point.

06:06.167 --> 06:08.601
Well, maybe it's one
of those other shows, like...

06:08.636 --> 06:10.336
Outer Limits or...

06:10.371 --> 06:12.199
Confuse The Twilight Zone
with The Outer Limits?

06:12.235 --> 06:14.440
Do you even know me?!

06:14.476 --> 06:17.443
Can we talk about this
over dinner, please?

06:17.479 --> 06:19.645
I-I'm not gonna be able to eat
until I find this.

06:19.681 --> 06:21.156
Ever again.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.016
It can't be that good of an episode.

06:24.052 --> 06:26.519
It-It's-it's not
about the episode, Scully.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.954
It's about my memory

06:27.989 --> 06:30.207
of seeing my first Twilight Zone.

06:30.725 --> 06:32.125
It changed me.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.459
You don't forget that.

06:33.495 --> 06:35.061
I was eight years old.

06:35.096 --> 06:36.829
My parents let me stay up till midnight

06:36.865 --> 06:39.365
because that was back
in the day when it only aired,

06:39.400 --> 06:42.001
you know, late at night
on some local channel.

06:42.036 --> 06:44.054
Wait, what?!

06:45.764 --> 06:47.907
And my name's not Buddy.

06:47.942 --> 06:50.343
- Oh, now I get it.
- Wait, what?!

06:51.513 --> 06:53.036
I remember it all so clearly,

06:53.654 --> 06:55.186
as if it just happened.

07:03.114 --> 07:04.790
He stand you up again?

07:08.912 --> 07:12.331
Uh, are you that guy
that met with Mulder last night?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.001
Uh, what gave it away, Skulls?

07:16.044 --> 07:17.069
He mentioned

07:17.105 --> 07:18.271
the forehead sweat.

07:18.630 --> 07:20.339
I need you to help me find someone.

07:20.966 --> 07:22.208
Who?

07:22.634 --> 07:24.010
Me.

07:24.845 --> 07:25.945
They...

07:25.980 --> 07:28.414
they're trying to erase me!

07:28.449 --> 07:29.749
Skulls, look, I can prove it.

07:29.784 --> 07:31.560
Hey, I'm armed.

07:32.153 --> 07:34.153
Just...

07:41.663 --> 07:42.737
Wh...

07:44.406 --> 07:46.766
Wh-Where did you find this?

07:46.801 --> 07:49.502
My fingerprints are on that box.

07:50.939 --> 07:52.505
Just prove that I'm real!

07:55.273 --> 07:56.533
W-Wait!

07:56.569 --> 07:58.411
Who... uh...

08:16.070 --> 08:17.703
Let me... L-Let me,
let me get this straight.

08:17.738 --> 08:20.899
Wh-When it cools, it forms
into three different layers,

08:20.940 --> 08:23.974
with three different textures,
all from the same mix?

08:24.010 --> 08:26.176
How has this never been an X-File?

08:26.781 --> 08:29.747
I-I have such wonderful memories
associated with it.

08:29.782 --> 08:32.082
I remember my mom making it.

08:32.118 --> 08:35.284
I remember family vacations
over the summer holidays,

08:35.318 --> 08:38.022
and Fourth of July, fireworks,

08:38.057 --> 08:40.691
America, God, love.

08:40.726 --> 08:42.693
That's some Jell-O.

08:42.727 --> 08:44.328
I mean, just the cherry flavor.

08:44.363 --> 08:46.430
The lemon-lime tasted
like leprechaun taint.

08:46.465 --> 08:49.500
But I-I have literally been
looking for this for decades.

08:49.535 --> 08:52.803
But every time I look
for Goop-O A-B-C, everyone says,

08:52.838 --> 08:55.673
"No, you must be thinking
about Jell-O 1-2-3."

08:55.708 --> 08:57.141
It's the Mandela Effect.

08:57.176 --> 08:59.043
- What do you mean?
- When someone has

08:59.078 --> 09:00.978
a memory of something that's not shared

09:01.013 --> 09:03.614
by the majority or the factual record.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.183
For instance, there are
some people that have a memory

09:06.218 --> 09:09.853
of seeing a movie called
Shazaam, starring Sinbad

09:09.889 --> 09:12.656
as an irrepressible genie, even
after it's pointed out to them

09:12.692 --> 09:15.059
that they're probably thinking
of a movie called Kazaam,

09:15.094 --> 09:17.161
starring Shaquille O'Neal
as an irrepressible genie,

09:17.196 --> 09:20.864
especially 'cause a movie
called Shazaam was never made.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.766
But what if I don't remember
either movie?

09:22.801 --> 09:25.441
- You win!
- But, Mulder,

09:25.477 --> 09:27.371
isn't your false Twilight Zone memory

09:27.406 --> 09:28.739
also a Mandela Effect?

09:28.774 --> 09:31.709
No, because my false memory is real.

09:31.744 --> 09:35.346
But, again, how does this... mystery guy,

09:35.381 --> 09:38.215
whose fingerprints came up with nothing,

09:38.250 --> 09:40.250
how does he even know about these,

09:40.286 --> 09:41.418
these secret memories of ours?

09:41.454 --> 09:43.087
You can ask him yourself tonight.

09:43.122 --> 09:45.089
I already taped an "X"
to the window this morning.

09:45.124 --> 09:47.157
But that's your secret rendezvous signal.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.927
I don't want to intrude.

09:50.532 --> 09:52.867
He clearly wants you involved, Scully.

09:53.532 --> 09:55.532
Come on, it'll be like a date.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.674
Well, this is romantic.

10:03.709 --> 10:05.075
Isn't it?

10:25.264 --> 10:26.964
So, who are you?

10:26.999 --> 10:28.565
I think my name is Reggie.

10:29.112 --> 10:31.068
Reggie something.

10:31.656 --> 10:35.973
Well, Mr. Something, you want to
tell us what this is all about?

10:36.453 --> 10:39.410
Like all life-questioning revelations,

10:39.445 --> 10:41.111
it came to me while I was moving.

10:41.147 --> 10:43.540
Not myself, but my mother.

10:43.575 --> 10:45.549
And when unpacking her stuff,
I came across a bunch

10:45.584 --> 10:47.217
of old things of mine she kept.

10:48.089 --> 10:50.287
Remembering my mom reading
Dr. Wuzzle books to me

10:50.322 --> 10:52.756
is one of the fondest memories I have.

10:54.179 --> 10:57.127
But... when I looked more
closely at the book's cover,

10:57.163 --> 10:58.896
well, that's when the
woozle-wozzle-bloober-blubs

10:58.931 --> 11:00.037
really hit the fan.

11:00.072 --> 11:01.039
Wait, what?

11:01.074 --> 11:03.467
Because Dr. Wuzzle's name
was spelled different

11:03.502 --> 11:05.135
than how I remembered... not with two Ss,

11:05.171 --> 11:06.470
but with two Zs.

11:08.607 --> 11:10.107
What's happening?!

11:10.142 --> 11:13.610
- It's the Mandela Effect.
- The what effect?

11:13.646 --> 11:15.779
The Mandela Effect.
When someone has a memory

11:15.815 --> 11:19.183
that doesn't coincide with
everybody else's or the facts.

11:19.218 --> 11:21.151
So named because
some people have a memory

11:21.187 --> 11:23.520
of hearing that Nelson Mandela
died in the '80s

11:23.556 --> 11:26.790
while imprisoned, when, in fact,
he died a free man in 2013.

11:27.337 --> 11:29.960
No. It's called the Mengele Effect

11:30.507 --> 11:31.795
because people have a memory

11:31.831 --> 11:35.699
of Josef Mengele getting
apprehended in Ohio in 1970.

11:35.735 --> 11:37.201
So, it's the Mengele Effect.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.203
The Mandela Effect has been

11:39.238 --> 11:40.504
an Internet meme for almost a decade.

11:40.539 --> 11:42.272
It's always been called that.

11:42.308 --> 11:45.772
Ah, see, you're having a Mengele
Effect about the Mandela Effect.

11:46.179 --> 11:48.178
I should know because
of how I found out about it.

11:48.214 --> 11:50.047
My search led me to a...

11:50.777 --> 11:53.650
historical repository
of vintage Americana.

11:59.494 --> 12:03.994
Excuse me... do you have
any old Dr. Wuzzle books?

12:04.029 --> 12:06.797
That's something somebody might
actually want, so, no.

12:06.832 --> 12:10.534
I do have something over
in the political shame section

12:10.569 --> 12:12.302
that might interest you.

12:17.276 --> 12:23.580
Uh, it's a cartoon that
Dr. Wuzzle drew back in 1940.

12:25.854 --> 12:27.484
Ah, damn it, it's still wrong!

12:27.520 --> 12:30.254
Easy, easy! If you're gonna
break something,

12:30.289 --> 12:32.156
use the Evel Knievel doll.

12:32.191 --> 12:33.857
It'll make it more authentic.

12:34.654 --> 12:35.659
What? No.

12:35.694 --> 12:37.282
I'm sorry. It-it...

12:38.153 --> 12:41.665
I remember his name being
spelled in a different way.

12:42.745 --> 12:44.735
Oh, boy. Sounds like somebody's suffering

12:44.770 --> 12:47.504
from the Mengele Effect.

12:47.540 --> 12:50.374
See? It's called the Mengele Effect.

12:50.409 --> 12:51.708
That doesn't prove anything.

12:51.744 --> 12:53.844
D... Just trust me, okay?

12:53.879 --> 12:56.446
I've done a lot of research
into this since then.

12:56.482 --> 13:00.050
And the shop owner himself was
a bit of an expert on the topic.

13:00.085 --> 13:02.619
Oh, it all started a couple
years ago... people coming in

13:02.655 --> 13:04.555
looking for some fondly-remembered item

13:04.590 --> 13:07.024
from their past, and I'd show it to them,

13:07.059 --> 13:08.926
but there's always something
just a little off.

13:08.961 --> 13:10.694
And they'd be like, "No,

13:10.729 --> 13:13.230
I remember the logo being racist
in a different way."

13:13.265 --> 13:15.432
It's like everybody's recall was
just a little out of whack.

13:15.467 --> 13:16.756
Yeah, yeah.

13:16.781 --> 13:20.204
And I think the government
knows about it.

13:20.742 --> 13:22.105
What-what do you mean?

13:22.141 --> 13:24.518
Oh, come on, the government always
knows more than they let on.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.810
For instance, do you think
that the government

13:26.846 --> 13:29.613
didn't know, when this
was being sold back in the '70s,

13:29.648 --> 13:31.481
that it wasn't full of carcinogens?

13:31.517 --> 13:35.548
They know the truth
about the... Mengele Effect.

13:36.322 --> 13:38.055
That's when I launched
my own investigation

13:38.090 --> 13:39.456
into the phenomenon.

13:39.491 --> 13:40.924
The Mengele Effect is being

13:40.960 --> 13:43.160
intentionally orchestrated by someone.

13:43.195 --> 13:45.429
Who? And to what end?

13:45.464 --> 13:47.231
For the simple reasons that Orwell said.

13:47.266 --> 13:49.766
"He who controls the past
controls the future."

13:49.802 --> 13:53.937
The ability to manipulate memory
creates unlimited power...

13:53.973 --> 13:56.139
political, economical, cultural.

13:56.175 --> 13:59.009
It runs the gamut from Holocaust denial

13:59.044 --> 14:00.677
to corporate product recognition.

14:00.713 --> 14:02.846
There are companies who are
willing to pay anything,

14:02.882 --> 14:04.915
do anything, to have people forget

14:04.950 --> 14:08.809
that their products explode on
impact or suddenly catch fire.

14:08.845 --> 14:10.621
Companies like G...

14:10.656 --> 14:14.237
...spending billions in profit
to repress these memories.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.276
The-the only thing
I haven't been able to do is

14:16.312 --> 14:18.328
to figure out how they're doing it.

14:18.364 --> 14:19.801
They can't.

14:20.199 --> 14:22.328
I-I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.

14:22.363 --> 14:23.667
I mean, the Mandela Effect is simp...

14:23.702 --> 14:25.734
It's the Mengele Effect, guys.

14:25.769 --> 14:27.170
It's the Mengele Effect. Just say it.

14:27.206 --> 14:30.874
...is simply people misremembering stuff.

14:30.910 --> 14:36.847
But maybe... this is actually
evidence of a parallel universe.

14:36.882 --> 14:38.548
- Wait, what?!
- Wait, what?!

14:38.584 --> 14:40.183
So maybe th-these differences

14:40.219 --> 14:42.319
in collective memories
are actually evidence of

14:42.354 --> 14:45.489
of our universe somehow becoming
intertwined with another,

14:45.524 --> 14:48.056
if not identical,
then very similar, universe.

14:48.103 --> 14:49.436
So people's memories are correct.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.870
They're just remembering something

14:50.906 --> 14:52.272
that happened in another dimension.

14:52.307 --> 14:53.707
Hence, the discrepancies.

14:53.742 --> 14:55.013
That's science, Scully.

14:55.049 --> 14:58.935
- Theoretical science, at best, Mulder.
- Yeah.

14:58.970 --> 15:01.114
We're not gonna do
this parallel universe,

15:01.149 --> 15:03.416
sci-fi gobbledygook, nerd boy, okay?

15:03.452 --> 15:05.218
So just, please, drop it.

15:05.253 --> 15:06.656
Because that crap gives me a headache.

15:06.681 --> 15:07.821
It's a lot better

15:07.856 --> 15:10.623
than some evil entity
zapping people's brains

15:10.659 --> 15:11.900
with a hypno-ray gun?

15:11.936 --> 15:13.510
I never mentioned a hypno-ray gun...

15:13.546 --> 15:15.298
Guys...

15:15.299 --> 15:18.934
it's faulty memory because Occam's razor.

15:18.969 --> 15:20.635
That's "Ozzie's razor," not Occam's.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.738
It's always been Ozzie's razor.

15:22.773 --> 15:24.706
Maybe in a parallel universe it is,

15:24.742 --> 15:26.608
but in still yet another universe,

15:26.643 --> 15:28.810
it's perhaps known as "Occam's ax."

15:28.846 --> 15:30.569
It's not parallel universes!

15:31.369 --> 15:32.434
Now, look,

15:32.469 --> 15:35.817
since I'm the only one with any
proof of this insidious plot...

15:35.853 --> 15:37.986
What proof?
You've yet to offer any proof.

15:38.022 --> 15:41.056
Proof is in the fact that once I
uncovered what they were up to,

15:41.091 --> 15:43.258
they turned the Mengele Effect on me.

15:43.293 --> 15:45.595
Just, look.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.297
It's my high school yearbook
my mom kept, right?

15:49.333 --> 15:54.269
There is not a single picture
of me in here... anywhere.

15:54.304 --> 15:57.528
There's not any inscriptions
from my classmates here.

15:57.564 --> 15:59.935
No "Have a great summer,"
"You were funny in math class."

15:59.970 --> 16:03.011
Nothing. It's like I never
even went to this school.

16:03.047 --> 16:05.187
Maybe you did,
but in a parallel universe.

16:05.222 --> 16:07.582
Exactly... Knock that off.

16:07.618 --> 16:10.281
Reggie, none of us
remember our high school years

16:10.316 --> 16:11.820
with much accuracy.

16:11.855 --> 16:16.458
Skulls, I wish this was about
my own psychological issues.

16:16.493 --> 16:19.694
That way, the memorabilia
shop owner would still be alive.

16:19.730 --> 16:22.030
When I went back to tell him
about the conspiracy

16:22.066 --> 16:24.866
to manipulate memory, and to see
if he had those little...

16:24.902 --> 16:26.701
Do you guys remember the little candies

16:26.737 --> 16:28.637
that were shaped like watermelon slices,

16:28.672 --> 16:30.605
but they taste like coconut?

16:31.015 --> 16:34.176
When I went back, they had silenced him.

16:40.517 --> 16:42.517
They had impaled him with a lawn dart.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.155
I'm sorry, but

16:47.191 --> 16:49.157
what's a lawn dart?

16:49.193 --> 16:51.960
Oh, it's this kid's game,
where you would try

16:51.995 --> 16:54.362
to throw these mini-metallic
javelins into the air

16:54.398 --> 16:56.631
onto these rings that you put on a lawn.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.967
And they sold these to kids?

16:59.002 --> 17:01.970
We were made of sterner stuff
back then, Scully.

17:02.005 --> 17:04.739
Well, it just sounds like
an accidental death to me.

17:04.775 --> 17:08.210
No! No, that's what
they want you to believe!

17:12.056 --> 17:13.848
Sounds like your ride's here.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.852
- You're not...
- She thinks I'm just some kind of

17:16.887 --> 17:19.087
conspiracy nut. Well, you know what?

17:19.123 --> 17:20.555
A conspiracy nut is right twice a day.

17:20.590 --> 17:21.890
No, that's a broken clock.

17:21.925 --> 17:23.525
Okay, it still applies because

17:23.560 --> 17:25.227
they want you to think
all conspiracies are nutty,

17:25.262 --> 17:27.929
so you will ignore the ones
that are true.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.866
Reggie, take it from a fellow nut, okay?

17:30.901 --> 17:33.702
At some point, you're gonna have
to explain who "they" are.

17:34.203 --> 17:37.339
You keep on referring to this
omnipresent, mysterious "they"

17:37.374 --> 17:39.708
to give intentionality to random events,

17:39.743 --> 17:41.910
or external explanations
for psychological ones.

17:41.945 --> 17:43.545
But there's no "they" there.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.715
Who is "they"?

17:48.509 --> 17:50.018
This guy!

17:50.720 --> 17:52.320
He is They!

18:02.194 --> 18:03.761
This is the story of a man named They.

18:03.796 --> 18:05.963
Dr. Thaddeus Q. They, a neuroscientist

18:05.998 --> 18:09.500
who has discovered a way to
manipulate collective memory.

18:09.535 --> 18:12.569
Most people have never heard
of him, or rather, they have,

18:12.605 --> 18:14.438
but he has manipulated their
memories to make them forget

18:14.473 --> 18:16.040
that they ever have.

18:16.469 --> 18:17.709
While working on NASA's

18:17.734 --> 18:20.010
top secret Operation Soy Bomb,

18:20.046 --> 18:23.313
involving future, one-way space
flights beyond our realm,

18:23.349 --> 18:26.583
Dr. They devised a technique
to change specific memories,

18:26.619 --> 18:29.319
which would allow astronauts
to complete their mission

18:29.355 --> 18:32.503
without being weighed down by
thoughts of life back on Earth.

18:32.538 --> 18:34.726
However, Dr. They was fired

18:34.760 --> 18:36.232
for also making the astronauts think

18:36.268 --> 18:38.351
that they were chimpanzees.

18:39.336 --> 18:41.230
He perfected his research
while at the U.S.

18:41.265 --> 18:42.806
university hospital in Grenada,

18:42.841 --> 18:44.574
and now applies his method for a number

18:44.610 --> 18:46.843
of unknown, mysterious clients.

18:46.878 --> 18:49.079
His memory manipulations
have run the gamut

18:49.114 --> 18:50.580
from Holocaust denial

18:50.616 --> 18:52.082
to corporate product recognition

18:52.117 --> 18:53.483
to making people forget he, himself,

18:53.518 --> 18:56.353
once starred as an irrepressible genie

18:56.388 --> 18:58.088
in a movie called Ka-Blaam!

18:58.123 --> 18:59.723
Dr. They has not been heard of

18:59.758 --> 19:01.424
for many years, but rumors swirled

19:01.460 --> 19:03.693
that he was at the last
presidential inauguration,

19:03.729 --> 19:06.830
where, amongst the hundreds
of millions who attended,

19:06.865 --> 19:10.100
he was seen occupying the last
remaining seat available.

19:10.135 --> 19:12.836
And as to his motivations
for being there,

19:12.871 --> 19:17.073
and what exactly he is up to
now, we have no way of knowing.

19:17.109 --> 19:19.109
Or perhaps we once did,

19:19.144 --> 19:21.499
but have since been made to forget.

19:22.100 --> 19:25.115
Oh. What the hell was that?

19:25.150 --> 19:27.017
That video was...

19:27.052 --> 19:28.518
unbelievable.

19:28.553 --> 19:30.526
You want to hear unbelievable,

19:30.561 --> 19:32.088
check out some of these comments.

19:32.124 --> 19:34.958
"I think the editing
could have been tighter."

19:34.993 --> 19:36.593
This jerk just says, "Meh."

19:37.843 --> 19:39.377
When I stumbled
across this on the Darknet,

19:39.412 --> 19:41.765
I tried to confirm
as much of it as I could,

19:41.800 --> 19:44.300
but I was only able to verify
the most important part...

19:44.336 --> 19:45.635
the Grenada thing.

19:45.671 --> 19:47.737
That was the most important part?

19:47.773 --> 19:51.207
Tell me, Little Miss Skeptic,
why did we invade Grenada?

19:51.243 --> 19:54.244
Uh... when was that again?

19:54.279 --> 19:56.146
There was a Marxist overthrow
of the government,

19:56.181 --> 19:58.281
and Reagan was concerned
about some U.S. students

19:58.316 --> 19:59.783
at a university hospital.

19:59.818 --> 20:01.605
Okay, now you're just...

20:01.641 --> 20:03.132
- What?
- You're just embarrassing

20:03.157 --> 20:04.454
yourself at this point.

20:04.489 --> 20:07.223
Those were the official reasons,

20:07.259 --> 20:09.926
but no one really remembers the reasons,

20:09.961 --> 20:12.696
not even me, and I was there!

20:14.833 --> 20:16.900
And I found this amongst my mom's stuff.

20:16.935 --> 20:19.269
I wrote it when I was
in Grenada, when I was 18,

20:19.304 --> 20:21.495
to be read when I turned 50.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.278
"To myself at age 50.

20:28.313 --> 20:29.962
Always remember..."

20:31.005 --> 20:33.349
And the rest of the letter's redacted.

20:33.385 --> 20:34.851
Who redacted it?

20:35.134 --> 20:36.820
I think I did when I wrote it.

20:36.855 --> 20:39.489
It was meant as kind of a joke,
but... I mean, that kind

20:39.524 --> 20:41.124
of stuff was funny
to me when I was a kid.

20:41.159 --> 20:42.625
Okay, what does this prove?

20:42.661 --> 20:44.810
You're missing the most important part.

20:46.465 --> 20:49.966
Oh. A Grenada UFO stamp.

20:50.001 --> 20:51.868
- Yeah.
- What's that?

20:51.903 --> 20:54.104
The Prime Minister of Grenada
once advocated in front

20:54.139 --> 20:56.973
of the U.N. for the creation
of a department of UFO research.

20:57.008 --> 20:59.676
He-he issued these stamps
to raise money for that effort.

20:59.711 --> 21:02.445
After he was deposed,
he confessed that a UFO

21:02.481 --> 21:03.980
had crashed off their coast,
and a dead alien

21:04.015 --> 21:06.149
had been recovered from the waters.

21:06.184 --> 21:09.502
Correct, except for one detail.

21:10.021 --> 21:12.588
The alien wasn't dead!

21:13.325 --> 21:15.358
Now, I was a med student
at that hospital.

21:15.393 --> 21:17.794
That's where they brought in
the semiconscious alien,

21:17.829 --> 21:21.197
and Dr. They was in charge
of trying to save it.

21:21.233 --> 21:22.899
Apparently the alien
had been sent to Earth

21:22.934 --> 21:26.136
to warn us about the holes
in the ozone layer.

21:26.171 --> 21:29.038
One of his people
would return in 35 years to see

21:29.074 --> 21:31.908
if we had managed to avoid
environmental catastrophe.

21:46.091 --> 21:48.947
Now, I only caught glimpses
of their conversation.

21:48.982 --> 21:51.861
The two of them talked
alien telepathically.

21:51.897 --> 21:54.097
I will telepathically transfer to you

21:54.132 --> 21:57.901
all our knowledge
of what you call "the brain."

21:57.936 --> 22:00.370
But that's when the invasion occurred

22:00.405 --> 22:02.038
and the men
from the government showed up.

22:02.073 --> 22:03.439
Wait, what?

22:14.486 --> 22:16.719
I don't know if I repressed the memory

22:16.755 --> 22:19.238
or Dr. They erased my mind, but...

22:19.658 --> 22:21.240
seeing that stamp,

22:21.660 --> 22:23.693
it all came flooding back to me.

22:23.728 --> 22:26.362
Now we're dealing
with recovered memories?

22:26.398 --> 22:29.832
I-I'm sorry. I'm out.

22:31.102 --> 22:32.602
Reggie, what you

22:32.637 --> 22:35.212
told us is theoretically possible.

22:36.141 --> 22:37.974
But more likely in another universe.

22:42.261 --> 22:43.479
The one thing I didn't forget

22:43.515 --> 22:45.448
was the telepathic screams of that alien.

22:45.483 --> 22:48.418
No, wait, what are you...? Hey. Oh.

22:48.453 --> 22:50.453
Oh... no...

22:50.488 --> 22:52.622
I wanted to know where the men

22:52.657 --> 22:54.457
from the government took him.

22:54.492 --> 22:56.893
That's when I dropped out of med school,

22:56.928 --> 22:58.652
joined the FBI.

22:59.653 --> 23:01.464
And that's how I started the X-Files.

23:04.536 --> 23:06.169
That's right.

23:06.204 --> 23:07.770
We used to be partners!

23:35.331 --> 23:36.266
Yeah. Mulder.

23:36.301 --> 23:38.301
- Foxy.
- Oh, hey, Reggie. What's up?

23:38.337 --> 23:40.570
Got this really cool poster
for the office, man.

23:40.606 --> 23:43.781
I think you're gonna flip over it.

23:44.990 --> 23:47.778
Sorry, nobody down here but the FBI's

23:47.813 --> 23:49.446
most unwanted.

23:52.248 --> 23:53.984
Move along, sugar boobs.

23:54.019 --> 23:57.053
This is the X-Files. No women allowed.

24:05.230 --> 24:09.533
That guy is so creepy.

24:09.568 --> 24:11.968
Changes world history.

24:12.004 --> 24:15.105
And then Columbus
never discovers America.

24:15.140 --> 24:17.874
Man never lands on the moon.

24:17.910 --> 24:20.444
The U.S. never invades Grenada.

24:20.479 --> 24:21.978
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:22.014 --> 24:23.821
What's this about Grenada?

24:26.752 --> 24:28.552
Guys, if this turns out to be
killer cats,

24:28.587 --> 24:30.452
I'm gonna be very disappointed.

24:31.256 --> 24:33.723
She's their mother.

24:33.759 --> 24:35.959
Wait, if she's their mother,
how can she be their...

24:38.377 --> 24:39.563
Oh, boy.

24:56.515 --> 24:58.582
All those memories...

24:58.617 --> 25:02.026
You guys mean to tell me
you don't remember any of that?

25:02.776 --> 25:04.236
Not even...

25:04.690 --> 25:06.780
our last case together?

25:09.074 --> 25:11.061
This is the Mengele Effect in action.

25:11.097 --> 25:13.497
Dr. They is using it against us
because he knows

25:13.532 --> 25:15.832
that we are the only team
capable of stopping him.

25:15.868 --> 25:18.590
There is no Dr. They.

25:18.626 --> 25:20.103
Really?

25:20.138 --> 25:22.046
Well, tell that to his henchmen.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.610
And he sent more of them.

25:36.588 --> 25:38.421
FBI.

25:38.457 --> 25:41.625
- FBI.
- What are you doing here?

25:44.360 --> 25:45.662
You don't know?

25:46.610 --> 25:48.899
The legend that I've heard so much about

25:48.934 --> 25:50.467
would have already figured out
who this guy was

25:50.502 --> 25:51.935
that you've been talking to,

25:51.970 --> 25:54.954
and why we were asked
to find out why you are.

25:55.474 --> 25:57.641
But I guess that's how things go:

25:58.082 --> 25:59.709
you start out a rebel,

25:59.745 --> 26:01.912
but then you get fat.

26:01.947 --> 26:03.914
And the next thing you know...

26:03.949 --> 26:05.381
you're deep state.

26:05.817 --> 26:07.216
Sad.

26:12.958 --> 26:14.724
Do you know who I am?

26:14.760 --> 26:16.639
I'm Fox Mulder.

26:16.674 --> 26:19.073
I was fighting the power
and breaking conspiracies

26:19.109 --> 26:22.265
before you saw your first
chemtrail, you punks.

26:22.301 --> 26:25.245
I'm Fox freaking Mulder, you punks!

26:25.280 --> 26:26.903
I'm Fox Mulder!

26:26.939 --> 26:28.505
Fox Mulder!

26:28.540 --> 26:30.440
So this moron's father

26:30.475 --> 26:31.908
is somehow connected there.

26:31.944 --> 26:33.343
Reggie...

26:37.049 --> 26:39.816
To Bob Dylan,
whose '98 Grammy performance

26:39.851 --> 26:42.085
is remembered by millions
because a half naked man

26:42.120 --> 26:44.154
with the words "soy bomb"
written on his chest

26:44.189 --> 26:46.790
jumped onstage and started
dancing like a spaz.

26:46.825 --> 26:49.092
But no official video
of the incident exists.

26:49.127 --> 26:50.660
Did it even happen?

26:50.696 --> 26:52.762
Seven years later, the band Eels
releases a song,

26:52.798 --> 26:54.331
"Whatever Happened to Soy Bomb?"

26:54.366 --> 26:55.823
A coded message?

26:55.858 --> 26:57.601
Especially because the band's
lead singer,

26:57.636 --> 26:59.474
the son of Hugh Everett III,
who originated

26:59.510 --> 27:01.581
the many-worlds interpretation
of quantum physics...

27:01.616 --> 27:03.689
and I'm right back
to parallel universes again.

27:04.982 --> 27:06.943
It's true, Scully, I've lost the plot.

27:06.979 --> 27:08.545
I can't find the hidden connections

27:08.580 --> 27:09.980
between things anymore.

27:10.015 --> 27:11.348
The world has become too crazy

27:11.383 --> 27:13.350
for even my conspiratorial powers.

27:13.385 --> 27:14.985
Maybe you've just lost your taste for it,

27:15.021 --> 27:17.320
especially
after all this "birther" stuff.

27:17.995 --> 27:19.538
Maybe.

27:21.226 --> 27:23.493
Maybe it's just realizing the absurdity

27:23.528 --> 27:25.795
of an evil doctor named They.

27:30.340 --> 27:32.202
Mulder.

27:33.672 --> 27:36.840
When? Where?

27:40.846 --> 27:42.245
Who was that?

27:42.280 --> 27:43.847
Dr. They.

28:06.471 --> 28:08.879
Dr. They, I presume?

28:10.005 --> 28:13.209
Kids today don't even know
what this means.

28:13.717 --> 28:14.778
Why should they?

28:14.813 --> 28:16.946
I mean, when's the last time
someone admitted

28:16.982 --> 28:19.783
doing something they were ashamed of?

28:19.818 --> 28:22.052
Even if caught on tape doing it,
they just say,

28:22.087 --> 28:24.729
"Well, that was taken out of context."

28:24.765 --> 28:27.022
Yes, but why are you shaming me?

28:27.815 --> 28:30.727
Someone who's spent his life
seeking the truth

28:30.762 --> 28:33.263
behind every great conspiracy,

28:33.298 --> 28:36.466
and you're only now finding out about me?

28:38.534 --> 28:40.136
Perhaps it just goes to show

28:40.172 --> 28:41.905
how good you are at hiding
in the shadows.

28:41.940 --> 28:44.708
Who's hiding? I'm in the phone book.

28:44.743 --> 28:46.959
But nobody knows what's
a phone book anymore.

28:47.709 --> 28:49.746
I have to admit,
what little I know of you

28:49.781 --> 28:51.815
I got from a rather dubious online video.

28:51.850 --> 28:54.417
Oh. Did you like that? I made it.

28:54.453 --> 28:58.488
"phony fake news."

28:58.523 --> 29:00.957
It's a presentation of real facts,

29:00.992 --> 29:04.160
but in a way that assures
no one will believe any of it.

29:04.196 --> 29:05.295
To what end?

29:05.330 --> 29:07.931
The bitter end.

29:07.966 --> 29:09.999
Which is why, when I became aware

29:10.035 --> 29:12.836
that you were finally aware of me,

29:12.871 --> 29:15.739
I felt a professional courtesy
to meet with you

29:15.774 --> 29:18.308
and to tell you this in person...

29:19.032 --> 29:20.510
you're dead.

29:22.180 --> 29:23.947
Oh, that came out wrong.

29:23.982 --> 29:25.782
I'm sorry.

29:25.817 --> 29:27.016
I didn't mean to scare you.

29:27.052 --> 29:28.451
I meant your time,

29:28.487 --> 29:31.753
Agent Mulder, your-your time has passed.

29:32.421 --> 29:35.859
Okay. So, what is, or what was my time?

29:35.894 --> 29:38.628
Well, it's a time when
people of power thought

29:38.663 --> 29:41.865
that they could keep their secrets secret

29:41.900 --> 29:45.802
and were willing to do anything
to keep it that way.

29:45.837 --> 29:48.037
Those days are passed. Gone.

29:48.073 --> 29:50.974
We're now living in a post-cover-up,

29:51.009 --> 29:53.309
post-conspiracy age.

29:53.345 --> 29:55.612
N-No doubt, the kids will come up with

29:55.647 --> 29:57.847
some catchphrase for it.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.717
"Po-co" or something. They'll say, like,

30:00.752 --> 30:03.319
"Oh, that's so po-co."

30:03.355 --> 30:05.455
It'll make you wish you really were dead.

30:05.829 --> 30:08.558
As long as the truth gets out...

30:08.593 --> 30:11.961
They don't really care
whether the truth gets out,

30:11.997 --> 30:13.830
because the public no longer knows

30:13.865 --> 30:15.672
what's meant by "the truth."

30:16.935 --> 30:18.468
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean,

30:18.503 --> 30:20.170
no one can tell the difference anymore

30:20.205 --> 30:22.596
between what's real and what's fake.

30:22.597 --> 30:26.065
There's still an objective
truth, an objective reality.

30:26.100 --> 30:27.893
So what?

30:28.336 --> 30:30.970
I mean, you take this Mandela Effect.

30:31.005 --> 30:34.240
Well, in the old days,
I would never have come out

30:34.275 --> 30:36.342
and admitted to you that, yes,

30:36.377 --> 30:39.178
I can change
people's collective memories.

30:39.213 --> 30:41.895
And that would have meant
that I could control the past.

30:41.930 --> 30:44.617
And if that's true...
well, as Orson Welles once said,

30:44.652 --> 30:47.753
"He who controls the past,
controls the future."

30:47.789 --> 30:49.689
It was George Orwell that said that.

30:50.457 --> 30:51.958
Well, for now maybe.

30:51.993 --> 30:55.695
Anyway, the point is,
I can tell you all of this,

30:55.730 --> 30:58.097
right out in the open,
because it doesn't matter

30:58.132 --> 30:59.865
who knows about it.

30:59.901 --> 31:02.928
They won't know whether
to believe it or not.

31:03.137 --> 31:05.605
To be honest, I'm not believing
any of this.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.206
Well, believe what you want to believe...

31:07.241 --> 31:09.609
that's what everybody does
nowadays anyway.

31:09.644 --> 31:12.478
You're only proving my point, you twit.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.882
But, full disclosure, you're right.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.318
I can't control people's minds.

31:19.354 --> 31:21.954
Although it turns out
you don't really have to.

31:21.990 --> 31:24.890
All you need is some people
to think it's possible.

31:25.450 --> 31:28.628
And then you've sown the seeds
of uncertainty.

31:28.663 --> 31:31.631
All you really need is a laptop.

31:31.666 --> 31:33.799
So that's what this has all been about?

31:33.835 --> 31:35.401
The spread of online disinformation?

31:35.436 --> 31:36.878
Maybe.

31:37.338 --> 31:39.705
You know, our current president once said

31:39.741 --> 31:41.707
something truly profound.

31:42.092 --> 31:45.470
He said, "Nobody knows for sure."

31:46.763 --> 31:48.147
What was he referring to?

31:49.224 --> 31:51.117
What does it matter?

32:20.082 --> 32:21.748
Mulder!

32:21.783 --> 32:24.084
How the hell did you get in here?

32:24.119 --> 32:27.254
Foxy, what did you find out from They?

32:27.289 --> 32:29.693
I'm not exactly sure what
to think about any of it.

32:29.729 --> 32:32.525
Oh, God. What did They do to you?

32:32.561 --> 32:34.728
Look, that's exactly what
they want you to think

32:34.763 --> 32:36.149
about everything.

32:36.184 --> 32:38.148
First thing I need to do is
find out who you are.

32:38.183 --> 32:41.193
His name is Reginald Murgatroid.

32:42.819 --> 32:45.238
Using your yearbook,

32:45.274 --> 32:48.341
I tracked down your
high school transcripts.

32:48.377 --> 32:50.677
You only spent a few weeks
there, and you didn't graduate.

32:50.712 --> 32:53.513
But after completing your GEDs,
you enlisted in the army

32:53.548 --> 32:57.717
and participated in the invasion
of Grenada,

32:57.753 --> 33:02.422
where one of the resistance
soldiers/construction workers

33:02.457 --> 33:04.357
hit you on the head with a shovel.

33:04.393 --> 33:06.459
You received medical assistance

33:06.495 --> 33:08.595
at the U.S. university hospital there.

33:08.630 --> 33:10.030
After your stint in the military,

33:10.065 --> 33:14.034
you engaged in a series
of bureaucratic jobs

33:14.069 --> 33:16.228
in various federal agencies.

33:16.905 --> 33:18.838
Starting with the U.S. Postal Service.

33:22.390 --> 33:24.486
Then, the Internal Revenue Service.

33:27.768 --> 33:29.668
The Security and Exchange Commission.

33:32.130 --> 33:34.053
And the Department of Justice,
specifically

33:34.089 --> 33:35.754
in the Witness Protection Agency.

33:35.789 --> 33:38.383
All right, Anthony
"The Meat Grinder" Mortillaro,

33:38.418 --> 33:40.165
onetime hit man for the mob,

33:40.200 --> 33:43.263
you are now Tony Jones,
real estate agent.

33:43.298 --> 33:46.433
But after 9/11, you joined the CIA.

33:48.837 --> 33:50.303
Hey.

33:52.607 --> 33:55.189
And then onto the Pentagon,
with the Department of Defense.

33:55.225 --> 33:57.602
Boom goes the dynamite!

33:59.075 --> 33:59.980
Wait.

34:00.015 --> 34:01.581
Was that a wedding cake?

34:01.616 --> 34:03.616
Damn it! Not again.

34:04.853 --> 34:06.625
Oh, well, time for lunch.

34:06.626 --> 34:08.359
But your longest stint

34:08.393 --> 34:11.157
was at the NSA,
the National Security Agency.

34:11.192 --> 34:12.467
So you actually voted for him?

34:12.504 --> 34:14.732
Yeah. He's going to drain the swamp.

34:14.768 --> 34:17.301
Get all those Goldman Sachs
people out of the White House.

34:17.337 --> 34:19.771
Hey, Scully, did I ever
tell you about the time

34:19.806 --> 34:22.106
I found a Sasquatch footprint in the mud?

34:22.141 --> 34:24.641
Ah, yeah, you did.
I've heard this before.

34:24.677 --> 34:26.310
It was 35 years ago, about,

34:26.346 --> 34:27.911
- on the banks...
- It was on the banks

34:27.947 --> 34:30.715
- of the mighty Mogoagogo River.
- of the Mogoagogo River.

34:30.750 --> 34:32.216
Until about a year ago,

34:32.252 --> 34:35.219
when you were committed
to a mental institution

34:35.255 --> 34:36.987
because you'd had a nervous breakdown.

34:37.023 --> 34:39.978
Wait... what?

34:40.812 --> 34:42.493
Or perhaps

34:42.529 --> 34:45.077
it's merely the culmination
of disillusionment of a man

34:45.112 --> 34:49.132
who simply wanted to spend his
life in service of the country

34:49.168 --> 34:51.469
that he loved, but began
to feel tormented by the idea

34:51.504 --> 34:53.568
that he was betraying its very ideals.

34:53.603 --> 34:56.407
And so, using information,
apparently gathered

34:56.442 --> 34:58.643
through illegal, warrantless wiretaps,

34:59.206 --> 35:01.479
you escaped into a fantasy
where you imagined

35:01.514 --> 35:03.281
that you joined a team that still did

35:03.316 --> 35:06.884
fight for truth and justice.

35:10.592 --> 35:11.689
Or...

35:11.724 --> 35:14.258
I'm from a parallel universe,
and I jumped dimensions...

35:14.294 --> 35:15.785
no, that's stupid.

35:15.820 --> 35:17.528
Right? Sorry.

35:17.933 --> 35:19.392
Mm-hmm.

35:23.036 --> 35:24.502
Well...

35:24.537 --> 35:26.608
looks like my ride is here.

35:27.740 --> 35:29.340
Hey, guys.

35:29.375 --> 35:31.509
Uh, you remember what I said last time

35:31.544 --> 35:33.611
about if you wanted me
to come along peacefully?

35:33.646 --> 35:37.348
Aw, Mr. Murgatroid, it demeans all of us.

35:37.383 --> 35:40.985
No. No, it gives us
a touch of classicism.

35:41.020 --> 35:42.520
Mm.

35:42.999 --> 35:44.555
So you remember how, uh,

35:44.591 --> 35:46.290
crazy people used to be portrayed

35:46.326 --> 35:47.892
as thinking they were Napoleon?

35:49.195 --> 35:50.695
When did that stop?

35:50.730 --> 35:52.997
Maybe it's another Mengele Effect, right?

35:53.032 --> 35:55.032
Well, uh, take care, guys.

35:55.068 --> 35:56.567
Stay sane.

35:56.603 --> 36:00.225
And, um, good luck
with the rest of your cases.

36:03.176 --> 36:04.342
Reggie.

36:06.579 --> 36:10.781
Our last case together, what happened?

36:16.089 --> 36:18.189
We found the truth that's out there.

36:18.224 --> 36:21.893
I'd suddenly recalled the Alien
at Grenada's declaration,

36:21.928 --> 36:24.662
that one of his kind would
return to Earth 35 years later.

36:24.697 --> 36:28.032
Foxy's crazy intuition of the
uncanny led him to figure out

36:28.067 --> 36:30.034
the location of the visitation.

36:30.069 --> 36:31.736
Scully drove.

36:31.771 --> 36:33.004
There it is!

36:41.641 --> 36:44.148
Is that what I think it is?

36:47.397 --> 36:49.566
It's the gold record.

36:50.556 --> 36:51.722
Yup.

36:51.758 --> 36:53.124
It's the Voyager.

36:53.159 --> 36:55.026
What's left of it.

37:08.408 --> 37:11.809
Greetings, Earthlings.

37:39.472 --> 37:42.974
I come before you as a representative

37:43.009 --> 37:45.643
of the Intergalactic Union
of Sentient Beings

37:45.678 --> 37:49.080
from All Known Universes and Beyond.

37:49.115 --> 37:50.815
We have been observing your species

37:50.850 --> 37:54.018
for many, what you call, "years."

37:54.053 --> 37:56.020
Our study is now complete.

37:56.055 --> 37:59.623
We no longer wish to have
any further contact with you.

37:59.659 --> 38:02.660
We have returned your music sampler

38:02.695 --> 38:06.197
but will no longer tolerate any
further efforts on your part

38:06.232 --> 38:08.532
to venture beyond your realm.

38:08.568 --> 38:10.334
We are building a wall.

38:10.370 --> 38:15.206
It will be a beautiful, albeit
invisible, electromagnetic wall

38:15.241 --> 38:18.009
that will subatomically incinerate

38:18.044 --> 38:21.946
any probes you attempt to send
beyond your solar system.

38:21.981 --> 38:25.016
You're free
to explore Uranus all you want.

38:25.051 --> 38:26.784
But we can't allow your kind

38:26.819 --> 38:29.687
to infiltrate the rest of the cosmos.

38:29.722 --> 38:32.456
You're not sending us your best people.

38:32.492 --> 38:33.858
You're bringing drugs.

38:33.893 --> 38:35.559
You're bringing crime.

38:35.595 --> 38:37.395
You're rapists.

38:37.430 --> 38:41.065
And some, I assume, are good people,

38:41.678 --> 38:43.667
but we have no choice.

38:43.703 --> 38:44.969
Believe me.

38:45.004 --> 38:46.504
For although the rest of the galaxies

38:46.539 --> 38:49.473
all have their share
of these same problems,

38:49.509 --> 38:51.709
we fear you could infect us
with the one trait

38:51.744 --> 38:54.311
that is unique to Earthlings.

38:54.347 --> 38:55.880
You lie.

38:57.216 --> 38:59.016
To show there are no hard feelings,

38:59.052 --> 39:01.986
we've compiled a compendium
of answers to any questions

39:02.021 --> 39:04.915
you might still have regarding...

39:04.951 --> 39:07.058
anything.

39:16.546 --> 39:20.604
Good luck, and good riddance.

39:39.492 --> 39:43.127
Bing, bing, bong, bong, bing.

39:57.212 --> 39:59.376
So that's the truth?

39:59.412 --> 40:04.648
We're not alone in the universe,
but nobody likes us?

40:04.684 --> 40:06.221
It's okay, Mulder.

40:06.686 --> 40:09.420
- There'll always be more X-Files.
- No.

40:09.933 --> 40:13.895
They gave us
all the answers to everything.

40:14.460 --> 40:16.327
Even Sasquatch.

40:17.232 --> 40:20.097
No! It's not true!

40:20.485 --> 40:22.166
It can't be.

40:26.672 --> 40:28.672
It's time to face the facts, guys.

40:30.176 --> 40:32.413
This is the end of the X-Files.

40:33.459 --> 40:36.042
But maybe the point
wasn't to find the truth,

40:37.229 --> 40:38.729
but to find each other.

40:39.295 --> 40:41.847
For no matter where we go in our lives,

40:42.298 --> 40:44.822
we will always have the memories
of our time together,

40:44.857 --> 40:46.624
and no one can take those away

40:46.659 --> 40:48.626
or alter them in such a way
to make us doubt

40:48.651 --> 40:50.251
that they actually happened.

40:50.296 --> 40:51.349
Oh, Reggie.

40:52.231 --> 40:53.430
I've always...

40:53.455 --> 40:54.903
Shh.

40:55.668 --> 40:57.301
I know.

40:57.336 --> 40:59.232
I know.

41:11.684 --> 41:13.384
And as we now know,

41:13.746 --> 41:15.819
they lived happily ever after.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.394
We'll be sure to come visit you, Reggie.

41:23.429 --> 41:24.828
No, you won't.

41:43.516 --> 41:45.528
Where the hell are they taking Reggie?

41:48.427 --> 41:49.993
Wait, what?

41:52.124 --> 41:54.120
Hmm.

41:56.164 --> 41:58.429
I see you found your lost episode.

41:58.464 --> 42:00.531
Turns out it wasn't
a Twilight Zone after all.

42:00.566 --> 42:03.968
It was a knockoff show
called The Dusky Realm.

42:08.801 --> 42:10.608
Which is now lost for the ages.

42:12.645 --> 42:15.946
Couldn't find anything
to set it in, so I used your...

42:15.982 --> 42:18.716
Bigfoot impression as a mold.

42:24.984 --> 42:26.891
Oh, no, wait, you first.

42:26.926 --> 42:28.592
It could be the lemon-lime.

42:28.628 --> 42:30.031
But... yeah...

42:36.235 --> 42:37.830
Oh...

42:55.020 --> 42:57.054
I want to remember how it was.

43:02.146 --> 43:04.273
I want to remember how it all was.
