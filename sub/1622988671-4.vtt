18:10.356 --> 18:12.427
‐Do I need to call security?
‐Call security?

18:12.460 --> 18:14.364
‐With what, your smartphone?
‐(James laughing)

18:14.397 --> 18:16.401
‐Hey, you're hilarious.
‐(chuckles) Thanks, man.
‐Aw. Aw.

18:16.435 --> 18:18.138
‐Hey, little buddy.
‐Yeah, get your...
‐Yo, yo, yo!

18:18.172 --> 18:19.575
‐Oh, hey!
‐You're all funny.
‐Oh, shit.

18:19.609 --> 18:21.546
‐You're hilarious. Oh, so funny.
‐Give it back to him!

18:21.579 --> 18:23.817
‐Funny.
‐You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

18:23.850 --> 18:25.721
WOMAN: Why don't you
just get out of here!

18:25.754 --> 18:27.423
All right, you know what?

18:27.457 --> 18:29.260
Hey, kids, listen up. Listen up,

18:29.294 --> 18:31.164
because I got something
really important to tell you.

18:31.198 --> 18:33.435
Actually, this is
a public service announcement.

18:33.469 --> 18:34.839
Oh, shit.

18:34.872 --> 18:37.611
Santa isn't real.
It's just your parents.

18:37.645 --> 18:40.316
Yeah, they're the ones
who bring you your toys.

18:40.349 --> 18:42.186
‐Yeah.
‐I know it's a bummer,

18:42.220 --> 18:45.661
but I wish someone had told me
the truth when I was your age.

18:45.694 --> 18:47.731
It's gonna save you
years of disappointment

18:47.765 --> 18:50.303
and years of therapy.
You're welcome.

18:50.336 --> 18:52.407
‐Yeah.
‐Isn't that right, Santa, baby?

18:54.879 --> 18:58.419
Leave now.

18:58.452 --> 19:01.559
‐(Wyatt laughing)
‐(chuckles) Shit.
No, dude, come on.

19:01.592 --> 19:03.362
‐You're a naughty boy.
‐Come on, come on.

19:03.395 --> 19:04.632
‐Why would I leave, Santa?
‐WYATT: Give him a lap dance!

19:04.665 --> 19:06.368
‐JAMES: Yeah.
‐WYATT: Shit. Twerk.

19:06.401 --> 19:08.172
‐Twerk. Twerk. Twerk. Twerk.
‐Give him a lap dance!

19:08.205 --> 19:10.476
‐Dance. Dance. Dance. Dance.
‐Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

19:10.510 --> 19:12.514
‐Twerk. Twerk. Yeah.
‐Hey!

19:12.548 --> 19:15.887
‐WYATT: Oh! (chuckles)
‐Jesus.

19:15.921 --> 19:18.125
Guess we're not getting presents
this year, boys.

19:18.893 --> 19:21.331
You'll get what you deserve.

19:21.365 --> 19:22.568
‐(indistinct chatter over radio)
‐Oh, guys.

19:22.601 --> 19:23.870
‐Security. Security!
‐Oh, shit.

19:23.903 --> 19:25.507
Shit.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.878
(laughing):
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

19:27.911 --> 19:31.586
‐I did nothing.
‐Get 'em. Get 'em!

19:43.008 --> 19:44.912
We're back home, baby!

19:45.881 --> 19:47.450
I can't believe
we didn't get locked up today.

19:47.483 --> 19:48.853
Well, thank God for mall cops.

19:48.887 --> 19:50.489
You see that one
almost have a heart attack

19:50.524 --> 19:52.326
‐outside Applebee's?
‐Yeah.
‐(laughs)

19:52.360 --> 19:54.498
Yo, what about that Santa?
The look on his face

19:54.532 --> 19:56.401
‐like he wanted to erase us
from the Earth?
‐(laughs)

19:56.435 --> 19:58.372
Guess we messed up his gig.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.577
‐Yeah.
‐Whatever, man.
Bro House is back, baby!

20:00.610 --> 20:02.346
‐Yeah!
‐(computer beeps)
‐It's ready.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.451
‐Oh, shit.
‐And I'm just gonna
say it again,

20:04.484 --> 20:06.522
‐I...
‐Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

20:06.556 --> 20:08.425
Five. Four.

20:08.459 --> 20:11.532
ALL:
Three. Two. One.

20:11.566 --> 20:13.469
‐Happy New Year!
‐ZINN: Tell me, does Santa

20:13.503 --> 20:14.905
‐get first pick on elf chicks?
‐It's up, it's up, it's up.

20:14.939 --> 20:16.976
‐WOMAN: What?
‐You know, like, uh,

20:17.009 --> 20:18.980
‐are you his little... helper?
‐(Wyatt groans)

20:19.013 --> 20:20.817
‐WOMAN: Okay,
you guys need to leave now.
‐Jesus.

20:20.851 --> 20:22.521
ZINN (laughs): Dude,
we're just trying to have...

20:22.554 --> 20:23.957
JAMES:
I don't even remember
doing that.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.426
‐Call security? With what?
‐WYATT: Yeah.

20:25.459 --> 20:26.896
This mall thing
was your idea, man.

20:26.929 --> 20:28.566
Dude, it wasn't my idea

20:28.600 --> 20:30.570
to sexually harass
a female mall employee

20:30.604 --> 20:32.373
or humiliate a little person

20:32.407 --> 20:34.377
or tell a bunch of kids
that Santa Claus isn't real.

20:34.411 --> 20:37.684
Okay, so...
things got a little crazy.

20:37.718 --> 20:40.489
Yeah,
we were supposed to be making up

20:40.524 --> 20:43.328
‐for cheering
for a guy falling to his death.
‐WYATT: You know,

20:43.362 --> 20:44.765
if you don't like how we roll,

20:44.799 --> 20:46.903
maybe you're not
Bro House material.

20:46.936 --> 20:48.940
Maybe you should just move out.

20:48.973 --> 20:50.911
Well, the way we're going, we're
all gonna have to move out,

20:50.944 --> 20:52.413
‐so...
‐WYATT: See?

20:52.447 --> 20:54.017
Negative shit.
That's all you do.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.754
‐(chuckles): All I do?
‐Yeah.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.891
Who do you think records
and uploads all this crap?

20:57.925 --> 20:59.962
My blind nine‐year‐old cousin
can do that,

20:59.995 --> 21:02.266
‐and we wouldn't have
to cut her in on one‐fourth.
‐BARRY: Okay.

21:02.300 --> 21:04.738
‐Then get your
nine‐year‐old cousin to do this.
‐Bro, chill.

21:04.772 --> 21:06.308
Chill. Come on, Barry's right.

21:06.341 --> 21:07.744
He's the one that keeps
the whole thing running.

21:07.778 --> 21:10.416
Nobody clicks on Bro House
to see you, dude.

21:10.449 --> 21:12.420
They click to see us.
That's a fact.

21:12.453 --> 21:14.057
BARRY:
Okay, well,
maybe if people were clicking,

21:14.090 --> 21:16.996
we wouldn't be in total shit.

21:17.029 --> 21:18.933
Maybe if it wasn't
for your shit,

21:18.967 --> 21:20.670
‐we wouldn't be
in this total shit.
‐Guys, guys, guys.

21:20.704 --> 21:22.473
‐Are you kidding me?
‐Come on. Come on! Chill out.

21:22.508 --> 21:23.943
This is the Bro House.

21:23.977 --> 21:27.651
"Bro" means "brother,"
and this isn't what brothers do.

21:27.684 --> 21:30.824
We stand for something.
We stand for good friends

21:30.857 --> 21:33.496
and good fucking times
fucking shit up.

21:33.530 --> 21:35.867
And the country needs that
more than ever right now.

21:35.901 --> 21:38.071
The country
needs fucking shit up?

21:38.105 --> 21:40.009
‐(Wyatt scoffs)
‐We have to stick together.

21:40.042 --> 21:42.480
We can't let anything
tear us apart.

21:42.514 --> 21:44.752
No matter what.

21:44.785 --> 21:47.490
‐(computer chiming)
‐JAMES: Uh, hey, guys?

21:47.524 --> 21:49.060
Come check this out.

21:49.093 --> 21:51.632
Okay, bro, it's gonna be fine.

21:51.666 --> 21:54.470
There are comments.
"Just when I thought

21:54.505 --> 21:56.007
"the Bro House
couldn't sink any lower,

21:56.041 --> 21:57.611
‐you go and do this."
‐ZINN: Whatever, man.

21:57.644 --> 21:59.615
‐It's one comment.
‐BARRY: Nope.

21:59.648 --> 22:01.953
Here are some more.
"I don't know about Santa Claus,

22:01.986 --> 22:03.455
"but you guys are proof

22:03.488 --> 22:04.992
God doesn't exist.
Fuck off and die."

22:05.025 --> 22:06.863
Didn't really need
that second part, though.

22:06.896 --> 22:08.098
Oh, and we're losing followers.

22:08.131 --> 22:09.869
Fuck!

22:09.902 --> 22:12.875
This isn't fair!
How can people be so mean?

22:12.908 --> 22:15.680
‐It's fine. It's fine.
‐No, no, no, no, no,
I can't do this.

22:15.714 --> 22:17.584
I can't go back
to living with my parents.

22:17.618 --> 22:19.588
My dad's an asshole. I can't.

22:19.622 --> 22:21.492
ZINN:
Let me see this shit.

22:21.526 --> 22:23.362
Are we out of beer?

22:23.395 --> 22:24.865
‐There's another case
in the garage.
‐WYATT: Fuck.

22:24.899 --> 22:26.736
Dude, we've lost
this many followers already?

22:26.769 --> 22:28.840
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐I can't handle this.

22:28.873 --> 22:30.911
‐Wyatt.
‐Wyatt.
‐Wyatt.

22:30.944 --> 22:32.915
‐(computer continues chiming)
‐Dude.

22:32.948 --> 22:34.785
(James sighs)

22:34.818 --> 22:36.822
Fuck, this is bad. This is bad.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.493
Xanax.

22:38.526 --> 22:41.031
‐What?
‐I'll OD on Xanax.

22:41.064 --> 22:43.135
‐AUTOMATED VOICE: Bro House.
Bro House.
‐That's a good way to go.

22:43.168 --> 22:44.738
Bro House.

22:44.772 --> 22:46.642
Fuck is going on?

22:46.676 --> 22:48.045
Yo.

22:48.078 --> 22:49.548
This is Detective Deena Gibbs

22:49.582 --> 22:50.784
calling
from L. A. Robbery‐Homicide.

22:50.817 --> 22:52.453
Who am I speaking with?

22:52.486 --> 22:54.892
Uh, Zinn. What's this about?

22:54.925 --> 22:57.598
Were you a part
of an online prank

22:57.631 --> 23:00.035
at the Santa Village
in a mall in West L. A.?

23:00.069 --> 23:03.108
‐(sighs) Maybe.
‐I'm not interested
in your prank.

23:03.141 --> 23:05.479
I need to speak
with you and your friends

23:05.513 --> 23:07.751
about the individual
who was posing as Santa.

23:07.784 --> 23:10.189
‐Yeah, what about him?
‐It seems

23:10.222 --> 23:12.093
he wasn't the man
hired for the job.

23:12.126 --> 23:14.832
We just found that individual
in his apartment.

23:14.865 --> 23:16.502
Murdered.

23:16.535 --> 23:17.905
What, are you serious?

23:17.938 --> 23:19.541
Wait, this isn't a joke?

23:19.575 --> 23:21.478
‐I'm very serious, son.
‐(whispers): Guys.

23:21.512 --> 23:23.583
I need you and your friends to
come down to the police station

23:23.616 --> 23:24.885
tomorrow morning
and give a statement.

23:24.919 --> 23:26.889
U‐Um, y‐yeah.

23:26.923 --> 23:28.125
We can...
We can do that, I guess.

23:28.158 --> 23:30.195
I understand, uh,

23:30.229 --> 23:31.732
someone was recording the prank?

23:31.766 --> 23:33.803
I need a copy of that video.

23:33.836 --> 23:36.709
It could help us
locate this guy.

23:36.742 --> 23:40.784
We're pretty sure this isn't
the first time he's done this.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.529
We'll see you at the station
in the morning.

23:48.866 --> 23:50.637
(light buzzing)

24:04.698 --> 24:08.539
What the fuck?

24:08.573 --> 24:11.011
(grunting)

24:24.103 --> 24:27.043
that this guy actually
goes around killing mall Santas

24:27.076 --> 24:29.782
‐and taking their place.
‐Why?

24:29.815 --> 24:32.486
Uh, because he's crazy.

24:32.521 --> 24:34.758
Obsessed with being Santa.
I don't know.

24:34.792 --> 24:36.161
This all sounds made up to me.

24:36.194 --> 24:37.931
Are you sure
we're not being pranked?

24:37.964 --> 24:40.169
Well, if we show up
to the police station tomorrow

24:40.202 --> 24:41.772
and they don't know
what we're talking about,

24:41.806 --> 24:43.776
then we were pranked.

24:44.745 --> 24:46.816
‐(keys clacking)
‐(Barry clears throat)

24:46.849 --> 24:48.953
‐What are you doing?
‐I just want to see
this guy's face again.

24:48.986 --> 24:51.959
ZINN:
Guess we're not getting
presents this year, boys.

24:51.993 --> 24:53.896
You'll get what you deserve.

24:54.865 --> 24:56.836
Yeah, I mean...

24:56.869 --> 24:59.508
‐he definitely doesn't
look right.
‐(Zinn chuckles)

24:59.541 --> 25:01.679
Huh. Someone just uploaded

25:01.712 --> 25:02.948
a video to our account.

25:02.981 --> 25:04.685
What do you mean, "someone"?

25:04.718 --> 25:07.089
We're the only ones
that can do that.

25:10.262 --> 25:12.099
‐The hell?
‐(grunting)

25:12.133 --> 25:13.703
Whoa.

25:16.107 --> 25:17.577
Jesus.

25:17.611 --> 25:19.113
What the hell are we watching

25:19.147 --> 25:20.984
‐right now?
‐(chuckles) It's a prank.

25:21.017 --> 25:22.554
Wyatt's pranking us.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.560
Right?

25:25.593 --> 25:26.696
Yeah.

25:26.729 --> 25:28.231
Yeah, yeah, obviously.

25:28.265 --> 25:29.835
‐(chuckles)
‐I mean, it's pretty good.

25:29.868 --> 25:31.672
But he's such an asshole.

25:31.706 --> 25:34.243
Probably wasn't even a real cop
on the phone. God...

25:34.277 --> 25:35.980
Zinn?

25:36.014 --> 25:37.884
Dude, I'm gonna talk to him.

25:37.918 --> 25:39.688
‐I'm deleting this.
‐(computer chiming)

25:39.722 --> 25:41.224
Wait, look.

25:41.257 --> 25:43.596
(James chuckles)

25:43.629 --> 25:45.633
That's, like, 50 likes already.

25:45.667 --> 25:48.606
People are fucking loving it.

25:48.639 --> 25:51.311
‐"That's awesome."
‐BARRY: "Great effects."

25:51.344 --> 25:53.983
"Finally, something we like."
(chuckles)

25:55.319 --> 25:57.022
Wait, wh...

25:57.056 --> 25:59.762
‐Why'd you do that?
‐Because it's sick.

25:59.795 --> 26:01.565
I don't care if people like it.

26:02.299 --> 26:03.836
(grunts)

26:03.870 --> 26:06.274
It's back up.
Someone just reposted it.

26:06.307 --> 26:08.145
Who?

26:08.178 --> 26:10.750
I don't know.

26:10.784 --> 26:12.754
‐(computer chimes)
‐Now what?

26:12.788 --> 26:15.660
Someone just...
They just posted a‐a link.

26:15.693 --> 26:16.862
What the hell is that?

26:16.896 --> 26:18.633
BARRY:
It's...

26:18.666 --> 26:21.037
from the York Explorer Daily.

26:21.070 --> 26:23.074
What's that?

26:23.108 --> 26:24.812
Wyatt, dude, come on.

26:24.845 --> 26:26.214
We saw the video.

26:26.247 --> 26:27.818
You're gonna do
something like that,

26:27.851 --> 26:29.187
it's got to be a group call.

26:29.220 --> 26:31.057
Wyatt.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.596
Come on, man. It's not cool.

26:33.629 --> 26:34.932
Wyatt!

26:34.965 --> 26:36.735
(refrigerator rattles)

26:42.981 --> 26:45.018
(thudding nearby)

26:48.125 --> 26:50.964
"Scholars now believe
that the legend of Santa Claus

26:50.997 --> 26:53.669
"isn't based on Saint Nicholas
or any other saint.

26:53.703 --> 26:57.109
