Previously, on<i>Million Dollar</i>
<i>Listing New York...</i>

00:04.771 --> 00:05.739
Victor?

00:05.772 --> 00:06.973
I'm here.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.608
You just scared
the sh** out of me.

00:08.641 --> 00:11.644
My boss did
a lot of reconstruction

00:11.678 --> 00:14.948
and he'd like to get
some return on his investment.

00:14.981 --> 00:16.449
(Fredrik)
I am not losing this listing.

00:16.483 --> 00:18.752
The only thing
that I need now is time.

00:18.785 --> 00:19.953
You have one week.

00:21.988 --> 00:23.356
[mouthing words]

00:24.958 --> 00:26.259
Guess what?

00:26.292 --> 00:29.229
Congratulations.
We have deal.

00:29.262 --> 00:30.463
You friends, Luis?

00:32.699 --> 00:33.667
I'm always working.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.834
I don't like that.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.169
I have to go, right?
I have a showing now?

00:36.202 --> 00:38.538
Yeah, but I need you to,
like, take five, just relax.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.206
I don't need you
to tell me to relax.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.241
I understand,
I understand.

00:42.509 --> 00:43.743
What are you doing?

00:43.777 --> 00:46.446
I had a panic attack.
I thought I was going to die.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.184
[upbeat music]

00:51.217 --> 00:53.253
(Ryan)
My motto is expansion,

00:53.286 --> 00:56.289
always in all ways.

00:56.322 --> 00:58.858
(Luis)
New York City,
it's the most exciting city

00:58.892 --> 01:00.794
for real estate,
and that's why I'm here.

01:00.827 --> 01:03.129
(Fredrik)
I'm the closer
and a listing machine.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.732
What makes me better is that
I work harder than anyone else.

01:05.765 --> 01:06.800
Whee!

01:06.833 --> 01:08.635
We're friends now,
right?

01:08.668 --> 01:11.071
I don't need him,
and you don't either.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.806
This will never end.

01:12.839 --> 01:17.277
* *

01:22.382 --> 01:24.084
So cute.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.419
(Fredrik voice-over)
This area used to be called
the financial district,

01:26.453 --> 01:28.521
but it really isn't
financial anymore.

01:28.555 --> 01:30.390
Now it's becoming
so residential.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.758
Everybody wants to live here.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.827
It's fashion,
it's travel,

01:33.860 --> 01:35.395
it's restaurateurs,
hotels.

01:35.428 --> 01:38.732
Everything is coming down
to the new downtown,

01:38.765 --> 01:40.233
That's what we're calling it.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.534
- Hello there.
- How are you?

01:41.568 --> 01:43.003
- Fredrik Eklund.
- Eric Bass, nice to meet you.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.170
Hi, Eric, how are you?

01:44.204 --> 01:46.339
Eric Bass works
for one of the top developers

01:46.373 --> 01:48.575
in the city, GFI,
and they have invested

01:48.608 --> 01:50.777
over a billion dollars
in Manhattan alone,

01:50.810 --> 01:52.345
mostly in hotels.

01:52.379 --> 01:53.646
They are major.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.448
So let's talk
about why we're here.

01:55.482 --> 01:56.783
We have 5 Beekman.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.720
Wow.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.322
It's amazing,
it's beautiful.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.557
It's like the first time
I saw Derek.

02:04.591 --> 02:07.360
It's like you just look at it
and just--you want it.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.696
I just want it!

02:09.729 --> 02:11.731
Could this be one of the most
beautiful buildings downtown?

02:11.765 --> 02:14.067
It's a hidden gem.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.870
For decades, Beekman was
an office building,

02:16.903 --> 02:20.473
but as it got older and older,
fewer businesses remained there,

02:20.507 --> 02:22.842
and then 9/11 happened,

02:22.876 --> 02:26.079
and the last of the tenants
moved out.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.114
Wait till you see
the inside.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.151
For the last 15 years,
Beekman has been empty.

02:31.184 --> 02:34.287
I mean, can you imagine
that this beautiful, gorgeous,

02:34.320 --> 02:37.590
majestic building
architecture--empty.

02:38.591 --> 02:41.528
Thank God GFI bought it.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.129
5 Beekman is gonna be
a hybrid.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.099
The old, beautiful structure,
that's gonna be a hotel.

02:46.099 --> 02:50.136
Correct,
a 287 room hotel.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.139
But the hotel
is just the beginning.

02:53.173 --> 02:57.977
Right next door, attached to it,
is a 51-story tower rising.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.047
Midway up the building,
starting at the 17th floor

03:01.047 --> 03:04.718
to the 51st floor, will be
68 residential condominiums.

03:04.751 --> 03:05.752
And that's why I'm here?

03:05.785 --> 03:06.886
And that's why you're here.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.122
You must have insane views.

03:09.155 --> 03:10.857
The views are amazing,
Fredrik.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.962
The top two floors,
with 16-foot ceilings,

03:16.062 --> 03:19.632
are these
all-glass penthouses.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.701
This view up here,
this location,

03:21.735 --> 03:23.203
no one's ever
seen it before.

03:23.236 --> 03:27.774
Hudson River, East River,
360 views.

03:27.807 --> 03:30.076
This is the kind of project
that I dream of,

03:30.076 --> 03:33.847
not only because you're gonna be
combining the old with the new,

03:33.880 --> 03:35.648
but because of its size.

03:35.682 --> 03:38.485
Below the penthouses,
we have three condos--

03:38.518 --> 03:42.522
one bedrooms, two bedrooms,
three bedrooms.

03:42.555 --> 03:46.726
The pricing in the building will
average around $2,500 a foot,

03:46.760 --> 03:50.330
which is almost double
the average of the area,

03:50.363 --> 03:52.499
but there's a reason
for that.

03:52.532 --> 03:56.102
The condominium owners have
full access to the hotel

03:56.102 --> 03:58.238
and priority access as well
to the restaurants.

03:58.271 --> 04:00.607
All the amenities:
fitness center,

04:00.640 --> 04:03.209
concierge services,
room service--

04:03.243 --> 04:04.811
and I'm not talking
any room service.

04:04.844 --> 04:07.614
I'm talking catered
by Tom Colicchio.

04:07.647 --> 04:08.815
In Sweden, we say...

04:10.350 --> 04:14.320
Here in New York, you say,
"Fuhgetaboudit."

04:14.354 --> 04:15.922
Right?

04:15.955 --> 04:18.158
Let me ask you,
what is the sellout here?

04:18.191 --> 04:23.563
Sellout is between $250--
and $300 million.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.199
I see the numbers
moving in your head, Fredrik.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.535
300 million--
[speaking Swedish]

04:28.568 --> 04:30.537
Mm-hmm.
[speaking Swedish]

04:30.570 --> 04:32.138
4--5%.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.174
Oh, whew.

04:36.743 --> 04:37.777
Whew.
[chuckles]

04:37.811 --> 04:39.646
We do not have
a broker yet.

04:39.679 --> 04:42.682
We are talking to all the top
brokers in New York City.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.787
You want a broker
with an amazing track record,

04:47.821 --> 04:50.490
but also someone who has
the fire in his eyes.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.492
I mean, can you see
that I'm a little bit crazy?

04:52.525 --> 04:55.161
Can you see in my eyes?

04:55.195 --> 04:57.497
(Fredrik voice-over)
I can already see it
perfectly in my head.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.799
I mean, I am gonna create
the most beautiful,

04:59.833 --> 05:02.769
incredible, insane,
dramatic sales environment

05:02.802 --> 05:04.604
that no one has ever
seen before--

05:04.637 --> 05:07.907
unlike New York has ever seen
before, how's that?

05:07.941 --> 05:10.176
Let me present something.
Let me come back to you.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.113
I want to make a decision
by the end of this week.

05:15.248 --> 05:18.852
I'm looking very much forward
to seeing what you can show us.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.153
I'm excited.

05:20.186 --> 05:22.722
- I'm excited too.
- Thank you for the opportunity.

05:28.595 --> 05:29.963
Katherine, are you here?

05:30.063 --> 05:31.064
What's up?

05:31.097 --> 05:33.967
Some brainstorming...

05:34.067 --> 05:37.237
about 157 West 57th
and who to sell it to.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.111
We don't really have
a clear view of Central Park.

05:45.145 --> 05:48.348
We're kind of facing right
into that hotel right there.

05:48.381 --> 05:49.949
Look, I'm gonna be honest,
I don't know

05:49.983 --> 05:52.185
if they're gonna be okay
with the obstruction.

05:52.218 --> 05:53.586
We have a lot of options
right now.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.121
There's a lot of new
construction going up,

05:55.155 --> 05:57.490
and I think we have to
at least look

05:57.524 --> 05:58.958
at some of
these other options.

05:58.992 --> 06:02.662
The market north of $20 million
in the last 24 months has moved.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.664
There's so much
competing product.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.666
If you've got $14 million,

06:06.700 --> 06:09.169
does it have to be
a two-bedroom right now,

06:09.202 --> 06:12.639
or can you wait for one
of the other 15 buildings

06:12.672 --> 06:14.841
that's coming
to 57th Street?

06:14.874 --> 06:17.110
There's got to be somebody
that we can find

06:17.143 --> 06:18.712
who's just looking
for this

06:18.745 --> 06:20.680
but doesn't know
they're looking for it.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.515
It's really unique,
because someone can

06:22.549 --> 06:26.486
just write a check and move in.
They don't even have to think.

06:30.090 --> 06:33.793
While the views might be
a priority for old money buyers,

06:33.827 --> 06:36.863
some of the other features
like the bar,

06:36.896 --> 06:39.099
like the fact that it comes
fully furnished,

06:39.132 --> 06:42.068
might appeal
to new money buyers.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.704
The young and the rich.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.173
Uber's going public
later this year.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.975
Lot of young people
that are attached to that.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.910
They've got money,
or will have money.

06:52.212 --> 06:56.149
Tech tenants like Samsung,
expanding office space.

06:56.182 --> 06:58.885
More employees means
people need to live somewhere.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.854
That's young money
who would want,

07:00.887 --> 07:03.923
like, a bachelor pad
on 57th Street.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.326
20 years ago,
it wasn't really common

07:06.359 --> 07:09.029
for young people
to very suddenly

07:09.029 --> 07:11.297
come into a windfall
of cash,

07:11.331 --> 07:15.135
and if they did,
they probably won the lottery.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.937
Now, they just work
for Mark Zuckerberg.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.073
Bring them all there,
show them the building,

07:20.106 --> 07:22.409
and get them excited, and
if it's not one of those people,

07:22.442 --> 07:24.077
it'll be a ripple effect,
'cause they'll all go

07:24.110 --> 07:26.813
back to work and be like, "Hey,
I saw this totally crazy place.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.048
You should go
check it out."

07:28.081 --> 07:29.215
Sounds perfect.

07:29.249 --> 07:34.054
A new millionaire's party.
Awesome.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.055
All right,
so let's work on that.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.056
Let's start putting up a list.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.323
Yolanda,
did you hear all that?

07:37.357 --> 07:39.959
Yeah, I got it.
Already starting a list.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.361
Okay, thanks.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.663
So she's gonna do everything,
and just monitor her.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.799
See, this is what
brainstorming does.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.834
We come up with ideas
that are genius.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.611
(Luis)
[breathing deeply]

08:01.815 --> 08:04.818
[breathing deeply]

08:12.492 --> 08:13.860
[laughs]

08:15.528 --> 08:16.730
[ambulance alarm blaring]

08:16.763 --> 08:20.934
I was sitting with a client
and I had a panic attack.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.635
I thought I was
going to die.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.939
That's serious.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.409
Close your eyes,
and just breathe.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.345
[breathing deeply]

08:40.754 --> 08:42.655
F*** did you just do?
[laughs]

08:42.689 --> 08:44.124
You got present.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.063
We're gonna
turn things around.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.798
This is good.
I'm proud of you.

08:51.831 --> 08:55.869
So I want to start
from scratch with...

08:55.902 --> 08:57.137
393 Convent.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.171
Harlem.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.172
Harlem, yes.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.907
I love that house.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.849
I feel like this is New York's
best kept secret.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.151
And this is where
I come in.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.152
For the right price.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.386
Come,
let's talk price,

09:13.420 --> 09:15.021
and we'll figure out
what the right price is.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.290
Not only do I love that house,
I love these clients,

09:17.323 --> 09:20.460
but I f***ed up.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.897
There's a problem
with the offer.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.765
(woman)
The 3.5 offer?

09:25.799 --> 09:27.200
Yes.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.903
We're not gonna settle
for anything less than 3 1/2.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.037
We have no choice.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.207
It was overpriced,
that's true.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.543
That has never
stopped me before.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.180
(Luis voice-over)
A few months ago,
I lost my focus.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.516
My life was filled
with very frantic energy.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.686
But now I'm learning
to clear that clutter

09:46.720 --> 09:48.421
and focus
on what's important.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.790
You know, it may not
sound like a lot,

09:50.824 --> 09:53.927
but just taking
the time to breathe,

09:53.960 --> 09:57.630
it's helping me have a much
clearer vision about life.

10:00.467 --> 10:04.704
I want to...

10:04.738 --> 10:06.639
I want to call the Joneses.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.108
It hasn't been relisted.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.410
Send them an email,
tell them Luis would like

10:10.443 --> 10:11.911
a meeting with them
tomorrow.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.013
Okay.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.247
We will sell it at 3.5,

10:14.280 --> 10:16.349
because we believe
that it's worth 3.5.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.719
I have something to prove here,
not just to the Joneses,

10:19.753 --> 10:20.954
but to myself.

10:20.987 --> 10:24.057
I like Luis 2.0.
Keep meditating.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.393
[breathing deeply]

10:26.426 --> 10:27.594
[breathing deeply]

10:27.627 --> 10:30.030
[breathing deeply]

10:30.063 --> 10:31.931
- You should do yoga with me.
- No.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.400
All you have to do
is stretch.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.670
Maybe Luis 3.0
will try it.

10:37.671 --> 10:38.938
It's 2,145 square feet.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.340
It's the only two-bedroom
in the building.

10:41.441 --> 10:42.876
$13,995,000.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.526
(Fredrik)
Hi, guys.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.061
- Hello, Fredrik. How are you?
- Good to see you again.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.128
Good to see you again.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.432
This is hilarious.
What's going on?

11:05.465 --> 11:07.233
Part of my presentation

11:07.267 --> 11:09.069
is actually for you
to have a drink.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.403
(Eric) A drink?
(Fredrik) You'll understand

11:10.437 --> 11:13.506
in a couple of minutes.
Close your eyes.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.574
You're coming
in to the sales gallery.

11:14.607 --> 11:15.608
[people chattering
and cork popping]

11:15.642 --> 11:16.743
You hear champagne.

11:16.776 --> 11:21.748
You hear people laughing
like in a hotel lobby.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.450
[turns off tape]

11:23.483 --> 11:25.518
This is the reason
why I brought this guy.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.120
In the sales gallery,
as soon as people come in,

11:27.153 --> 11:29.189
they have to realize
they're almost in the hotel.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.858
I want the artwork
and the walls and everything

11:31.891 --> 11:34.094
to feel like
I'm in the hotel.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.463
(Fredrik voice-over)
The challenge
of any sales gallery

11:36.496 --> 11:39.165
is to create that feeling
of what it will feel like

11:39.199 --> 11:41.568
to actually live
in the building.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.937
But I also want
an element of surprise,

11:43.970 --> 11:45.605
something unexpected.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.475
What I'm suggesting
is taking this

11:48.508 --> 11:50.276
in our future sales gallery,

11:50.310 --> 11:53.646
but doing this
maybe 15 feet tall.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.482
- [laughs]
- 15 feet tall?

11:56.616 --> 11:58.651
that Fredrik standing here
will be able to look

11:58.685 --> 12:00.587
into these penthouse suites
here at the hotel.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.123
A fortune.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.659
A fortune that's gonna pay off
multiple times.

12:06.693 --> 12:09.062
(Fredrik voice-over)
Right now, the Beekman
isn't even completely built yet,

12:09.062 --> 12:11.097
but I'm gonna work so hard
and make this sales gallery

12:11.131 --> 12:13.500
such an experience
that when they walk in,

12:13.533 --> 12:15.502
it doesn't matter
it's not built,

12:15.535 --> 12:18.872
especially when they walk into
the model unit I'm gonna create.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.273
It's high tech,

12:20.306 --> 12:22.842
and we can showcase the views
from the apartments.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.745
I want you to build
huge monitors

12:25.779 --> 12:28.948
behind the windows,
a wall of TVs that--

12:28.982 --> 12:31.951
me on an iPad,
I can show different views,

12:31.985 --> 12:34.554
so when I'm in the model,
I can say, "Mr. Buyer,

12:34.587 --> 12:37.290
ooh, you like the B line
on the 43rd floor."

12:37.323 --> 12:38.291
[imitating typing]

12:38.324 --> 12:39.359
Whew!

12:39.392 --> 12:41.861
I'm gonna create
this amazing simulation.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.096
I've never seen that before.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.664
Good.
I like that.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.399
If you had seen it before,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.668
I wouldn't have
presented it to you.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.470
I mean, it's pretty
out-of-the-box.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.339
It's very out-of-the-box.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.974
This is how we're gonna
sell the building.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.509
Do you have an idea

12:56.543 --> 12:59.279
as to what the investment's
going to be here?

12:59.312 --> 13:02.315
In the millions.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.552
I mean, we--
we have a budget.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.956
The more you spend, the higher
prices you're gonna get,

13:10.056 --> 13:12.692
but also, the more you spend,
the quicker the sellout,

13:12.726 --> 13:14.627
and sometimes,
developers don't really see

13:14.661 --> 13:17.530
this direct relationship
between how much you spend

13:17.564 --> 13:19.899
and how much you're gonna get.
I see it very clearly.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.438
Very convincing presentation,
Fredrik.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.439
Thank you.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.942
However,
we are gonna be

13:28.975 --> 13:31.277
talking to a few more brokers
this afternoon.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.547
We also want it hear
what the people have to say.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.150
(Fredrik voice-over)
It's so scary when you work
so hard for something,

13:37.183 --> 13:41.454
the notion that the developer
could go with another broker.

13:41.488 --> 13:45.625
Only one person is gonna have
his or her name on the building,

13:45.658 --> 13:48.762
sell it out,
and get all that commission.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.497
Okay, Fredrik,
thank you very much.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.498
Good seeing you again.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.932
Thanks.
Nice to meet you.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.902
Thank you, Stella,
appreciate it.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.344
[elevator bell dings]

14:06.112 --> 14:08.048
Hello.
Thank you for coming.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.149
Cheers.
Thank you for coming.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.316
Hello.
What's up?

14:12.652 --> 14:14.087
I need something
that's gonna, like, pop.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.489
Is this too Ron Burgundy?

14:16.523 --> 14:19.259
Maybe we try something
that's a little louder?

14:19.292 --> 14:20.260
There you go.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.294
There he is.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.831
I'm your broker, bitch.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.535
I think that guy over there
works at Uber.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.270
Uber money is big money.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.706
There's three dudes
with really big sweaters

14:32.739 --> 14:35.342
who clearly built apps.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.078
(Ryan voice-over)
For the past two weeks,
my entire team

14:38.078 --> 14:40.347
has been researching
and working the phones.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.883
Biotech firms, game designers,
tech startups.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.687
If your company is based
in New York, you got a call.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.255
Anyone you see
who hasn't shaved,

14:49.289 --> 14:50.256
those people have money.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.291
Got it.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.895
It's 2,145 square feet.
It's the only two-bedroom

14:55.929 --> 14:58.264
in the building on the market
right now that faces the park.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.799
It's got crazy views,
it's gorgeous.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.335
$13,995,000.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.505
Soon.

15:05.538 --> 15:10.410
(Ryan)
The unit I'm selling has nearly
$1 million of furniture in it.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.512
I can't have
all these crazy people

15:12.545 --> 15:14.080
running around it at once.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.249
Fully furnished, decked out,
it's the sickest thing ever.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.151
It's a perfect bachelor pad.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.285
Are you married?

15:19.319 --> 15:20.720
There you go.
Cheers.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.189
(Ryan voice-over)
But having everyone
in the same room

15:23.223 --> 15:25.425
allows me the opportunity
to tailor my message

15:25.458 --> 15:27.794
about the building,
about the apartment,

15:27.827 --> 15:30.964
before I take them
up to see it.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.600
157th Street, so you can have
meetings in this space,

15:33.633 --> 15:36.469
you can network with people
who just bought an apartment

15:36.503 --> 15:38.071
for $100 million upstairs.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.541
The neighbors are
insanely wealthy,

15:41.574 --> 15:43.343
so you're in good company
in the elevator.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.344
[laughs]

15:44.377 --> 15:45.612
What is that,
by the way?

15:48.081 --> 15:49.983
You can make phone calls,
text message,

15:50.083 --> 15:51.618
emails,
whatever it may be.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.655
You're the only person
I'll tell this to,

15:55.689 --> 15:57.090
because you said you're
part of the Geek Squad.

15:57.123 --> 16:02.429
The owner's rep, I only know him
via his Segway iPad face.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.931
He rolls into the room, and
that's how he lives his life.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.132
I have one of those.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.400
- What?
- Yeah.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.435
I love Segways.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.071
On that note--

16:11.104 --> 16:13.106
I'll take you guys up
so you can see it finally.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.380
And here we are.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.750
Wow, this looks great.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.052
Attention to detail
like you've never seen before.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.154
These are bar stools
down here.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.489
- Mm-hmm.
- So they look like cabinets,

16:29.522 --> 16:30.623
but they come out.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.858
Oh, that's great,
that's great.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.426
- Isn't it cool?
- Yes.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.929
If it were bright out, you'd see
Central Park, it's right there.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.063
Yeah, it's a little hard
to see now, but--

16:37.097 --> 16:38.832
Yeah, Central Park's
not that well lit.

16:38.865 --> 16:42.936
(Ryan voice-over)
I didn't throw this party
at night by accident.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.971
Could you tell me a little bit
more about the technology?

16:45.071 --> 16:47.107
There's a Crestron system
that's built in throughout.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.776
It's fully wired for you.
You control it on your watch.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.379
What about your Internet?
Gigabit or is it megabit?

16:52.412 --> 16:53.847
It's--it's lots of bits.

16:53.880 --> 16:54.881
- Lots of bits?
- Yeah, the Internet's

16:54.914 --> 16:56.216
- very fast here.
- Okay.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.752
So this could be, like,
your command station right here.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.624
Right? Just do laptops
and just, like, code...

17:04.657 --> 17:06.026
until the middle
of the night.

17:06.026 --> 17:09.029
[laughter]

17:12.232 --> 17:15.301
TV is built into the wall.
Walls are velvet.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.603
Big, high ceilings.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.538
So how's the bedroom size
feel for you?

17:20.373 --> 17:23.410
So if you're interested,
I would say make an offer...

17:23.443 --> 17:25.311
We don't have too much time
'cause I have a line of people

17:25.345 --> 17:27.447
that I need to bring up here.
Literally everyone at the party

17:27.480 --> 17:30.150
is, like, texting me
and hammering me to come up.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.190
That was more
of a hypothetical.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.292
(Ryan)
So thank you all for coming.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.894
We take bitcoin.
Thank you very much.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.295
[laughter]

17:42.328 --> 17:44.664
Let me just check what
the current exchange rate is.

17:44.698 --> 17:45.865
In bitcoin?

17:45.899 --> 17:47.901
In bitcoin.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.907
I'm looking at
about 50,000 bitcoins.

17:53.940 --> 17:57.077
That actually puts it in
at around 13 and change.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.778
- 13 and change?
- Yeah.

17:58.812 --> 18:00.313
But you want to pay
in bitcoin?

18:00.347 --> 18:02.916
- In bitcoin, yeah.
- Yeah.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.451
I will talk to the owner.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.520
The owner is a tech titan
like yourself.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.055
I'm sure he will enjoy
the bitcoin offer.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.857
And bitcoin is
as good as cash.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.425
Great, thank you.
I have to present all offers.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.593
- I mean, it's legal, so--
- Yeah.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.563
I think it's legal.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.564
Right?

18:17.597 --> 18:18.631
- Thank you.
- Good, very good.

18:18.665 --> 18:19.632
- Thank you for your time.
- Perfect.

18:19.666 --> 18:20.667
I'll walk you out.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.838
Is it legal?

18:37.550 --> 18:38.551
[claps]

18:41.888 --> 18:43.890
Whew.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.693
- Hello.
- Luis.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.194
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm good.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.163
- Good to--it's been a minute.
- Mwah. Welcome back to Harlem.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.164
Thank you very much.

18:51.197 --> 18:52.165
It's been a minute.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.400
I was in the neighborhood.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.135
You were in the neighborhood.
You buy a property

18:55.168 --> 18:56.136
- in Harlem now?
- I was not.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.504
[both laughing]
- No, I have not.

18:58.805 --> 18:59.773
I know.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.041
This is our baby.

19:01.074 --> 19:03.176
Our pride and joy.

19:03.209 --> 19:04.544
(Mrs. Jones) Look who's here.
- Yes.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.012
There he is,
our favorite broker.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.180
Doctor, how are you?

19:07.213 --> 19:08.181
All right, it's good
to see you, my friend.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.215
Good to see you.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.451
- Looking very sharp.
- Likewise.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.586
(Ryan voice-over)
I don't know
how they're going to feel

19:13.620 --> 19:17.023
about what I'm going to say,

19:17.023 --> 19:22.529
but I feel like I am
back to being myself,

19:22.562 --> 19:25.165
which is, to me,
the most important part

19:25.198 --> 19:27.167
of anything in my life.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.803
I wanted to see you guys,
because I want to--

19:29.836 --> 19:32.038
I want to go back.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.347
and I want to get you the price
that this house deserves.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.050
We would like to get 3.5.
That's our number.

19:44.050 --> 19:47.420
The price that you guys wanted,
the price that I told you

19:47.454 --> 19:48.722
I could not get.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.891
Luis, if you want
to walk away from this,

19:51.925 --> 19:54.928
we understand that you have done
a tremendous job.

19:59.165 --> 20:02.936
I punched myself ten times
in the face for saying that.

20:02.969 --> 20:07.440
I want...
to finish this.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.809
The last go-round,
we were getting

20:09.843 --> 20:13.680
a lot of pushback from you
that we'd never seen before.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.882
It was a different Luis.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.353
I got promoted today.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.422
You don't seem
that excited.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.931
(Luis)
I want...to finish this.

20:31.965 --> 20:34.067
The last go-round,
we were getting

20:34.100 --> 20:38.038
a lot of pushback from you
that we'd never seen before,

20:38.071 --> 20:39.873
and so that was
a little hard for us,

20:39.906 --> 20:42.676
because we know
how beautiful this home is,

20:42.709 --> 20:45.011
we know how valuable
this house is,

20:45.045 --> 20:46.546
but yet we weren't really
feeling it from you,

20:46.579 --> 20:48.448
and it was a different Luis.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.184
I don't know, I just think maybe
you had so much going on,

20:51.217 --> 20:52.819
it was clear that
you weren't able

20:52.852 --> 20:56.356
to really give this
the time.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.626
(Luis voice-over)
It's very interesting
she says that,

20:59.659 --> 21:02.062
because she was able
to see then

21:02.062 --> 21:05.165
what I wasn't able to see
about myself.

21:05.198 --> 21:09.102
Why now? What's changed?
What's different?

21:09.135 --> 21:12.572
I was overwhelmed, I was
biting on more than I can chew.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.841
I was taking too much of--
I was not focused.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.345
And you know what?
We're only humans,

21:18.378 --> 21:20.080
and I think we all go through
things like that,

21:20.113 --> 21:22.349
but it's only--
it only matters

21:22.382 --> 21:24.384
when you are able
to recognize it,

21:24.417 --> 21:25.885
and I have.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.589
I took my time,
even before I decided

21:29.622 --> 21:32.258
I wanted to speak to you
until I was ready.

21:33.727 --> 21:36.730
And now I am.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.967
You know, we see
a change in your eye.

21:41.001 --> 21:44.337
You know, we can tell that
there's something brewing there.

21:44.371 --> 21:48.975
I think we're willing to...
give you...

21:49.009 --> 21:51.244
probably a 30-day contract.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.115
You think you can make it happen
in 30 days?

21:57.317 --> 21:59.486
It's a tall order, Luis.

22:01.721 --> 22:05.392
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

22:05.425 --> 22:08.661
3.5, 30 days,
no excuses.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.163
- All right.
- Okay.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.732
Phew!
Guys, it's a pleasure.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.401
Phew.
It feels amazing.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.902
[slapping on the back]
- Thank you, guys.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.070
- Glad to have you back, Luis.
- Oh, it's always

22:17.103 --> 22:19.139
a pleasure to see you.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.214
Oh, my God, Oh, my God,
Oh, my God, Oh, my God,

22:28.248 --> 22:29.315
Oh, my God, Oh, my God,
Oh, my God, Oh, my God--

22:29.349 --> 22:31.484
[rapid garbling]
God.

22:32.686 --> 22:34.954
(Fredrik voice-over)
I knew that I
came up with a brilliant idea

22:34.988 --> 22:38.692
for the Beekman showroom,
and the developers knew it too.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.093
[phone ringing]

22:40.126 --> 22:42.328
Fredrik Eklund here,
your favorite broker.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.541
(Fredrik)
You--your jaw is about to drop.

22:54.574 --> 22:57.110
No longer
a construction site.

22:57.110 --> 23:00.046
O-M-G.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.047
[bell dings]

23:01.047 --> 23:02.048
We're open!

23:04.484 --> 23:07.721
(Fredrik voice-over)
A month ago,
this was just a shell,

23:07.754 --> 23:10.056
and now,
we have transformed it--

23:10.090 --> 23:12.225
something truly magical.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.130
[gasps]

23:17.163 --> 23:20.300
Oh, my God, it's exactly
what I imagined.

23:22.469 --> 23:24.971
(Fredrik voice-over)
It is so beautiful and big,
and expensive.

23:25.071 --> 23:28.108
I mean, the average home in
the United States is $209,000,

23:28.141 --> 23:30.877
and this model is twice
as expensive. Oh, my God.

23:30.910 --> 23:34.314
You know what I love about it?
It feels so substantial.

23:34.347 --> 23:35.749
(David)
Cast in metal.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.150
(Fredrik)
The old, the new.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.285
And it's, like, lit up.
I feel like there's life.

23:39.319 --> 23:40.487
- Yeah.
- Like, I just want to walk

23:40.520 --> 23:42.088
into the lobby...

23:43.923 --> 23:46.259
(Fredrik voice-over)
I don't think you understand
how big this model is.

23:46.292 --> 23:49.963
I mean, I am 6'4", and standing
next to it, I feel like...

23:49.996 --> 23:51.765
Luis.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.200
[gasps]
Wow.

23:54.234 --> 23:56.302
If I have this reaction,
can you imagine buyers?

23:56.336 --> 23:57.771
(Fredrik voice-over)
People are gonna freak out

23:57.804 --> 23:59.172
when they come
into the showroom,

23:59.205 --> 24:01.174
and the model unit
with the simulated views

24:01.207 --> 24:02.676
isn't even done yet.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.879
But it will be, in time
for next week's launch party.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.047
- Mousie?
- [laughs]

24:07.080 --> 24:08.748
Is that Derek naked?

24:08.782 --> 24:10.517
Oh, my--oh.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.361
(Emilia)
I had no idea
you were gonna cook.

24:21.394 --> 24:22.762
That's what a surprise
is called.

24:22.796 --> 24:25.265
Doesn't this look like
the dinner I cooked you,

24:25.298 --> 24:26.533
like, on our third date?

24:26.566 --> 24:28.601
You mean the one
that I finished?

24:28.635 --> 24:31.671
I think that was the first time
you had ever cooked for me.

24:31.705 --> 24:33.139
This is the second.

24:33.173 --> 24:34.674
I did this one by myself.

24:36.209 --> 24:39.713
(Ryan voice-over)
157 has had me working late
all week,

24:39.746 --> 24:43.083
but tonight, I actually
made it home for dinner,

24:43.116 --> 24:45.652
and I cooked it.

24:47.387 --> 24:48.688
Work is good.

24:48.722 --> 24:49.856
You in court today?

24:49.889 --> 24:52.659
Yeah,
and attorney's offices.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.829
(Ryan)
I do feel guilty that we don't
get to spend more time together,

24:55.862 --> 24:59.899
but Emilia is very, very focused
on her career too.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.068
She's a super successful lawyer

25:02.102 --> 25:04.070
and she works
just as hard as I do.

25:04.104 --> 25:06.506
Well, you know how I had
this review?

25:06.539 --> 25:08.041
Yeah.

25:08.041 --> 25:10.543
I got promoted today.

25:10.577 --> 25:13.046
I get to run
Nationwide legal.

25:13.046 --> 25:14.881
That's awesome.

25:14.914 --> 25:15.915
It is.

25:15.949 --> 25:16.916
Cheers.

25:16.950 --> 25:18.651
Yeah.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.488
You don't seem
that excited.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.393
Well--

25:29.629 --> 25:31.731
They want me to move
to Geneva.

25:37.470 --> 25:39.472
To Geneva?

25:40.974 --> 25:43.343
Like, part time?

25:43.376 --> 25:46.613
No.
Like, full time.

25:49.949 --> 25:53.386
We just got engaged, and now
you want to move to Geneva.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.357
You know that I've worked
really hard.

25:57.390 --> 25:58.825
Mm-hmm.

25:58.858 --> 26:03.063
I think that this is something
that I really need to consider.

26:03.096 --> 26:05.131
(Ryan)
My relationship with Emilia

26:05.165 --> 26:09.135
is as much about New York
as my career.

26:09.169 --> 26:12.405
I mean, this is where we met,
this is where I proposed to her,

26:12.439 --> 26:14.541
this is where
we just put a down payment

26:14.574 --> 26:18.144
on a home that I thought

26:18.178 --> 26:22.048
we were gonna raise
our little puffermunkins in.

26:23.283 --> 26:24.484
I don't really know
what to say.

26:27.187 --> 26:29.889
Can you...

26:29.923 --> 26:33.593
not go to Geneva

26:33.626 --> 26:37.464
and maybe stay in New York
and do the same job?

26:37.497 --> 26:40.200
The reason why
I got into this company

26:40.233 --> 26:43.436
was to do
international shipping law.

26:43.470 --> 26:45.338
I can't leave New York.

26:45.372 --> 26:46.773
I can go other places
and come back,

26:46.806 --> 26:48.775
but I can't leave New York.
I sell real estate.

26:48.808 --> 26:53.079
You can sell real estate
anywhere.

26:53.079 --> 26:57.183
Technically...yeah,

26:57.217 --> 27:01.388
but I built a career
that I could only imagine

27:01.421 --> 27:03.790
in my wildest dreams,

27:03.823 --> 27:08.461
and it is fully, fully connected
to New York.

27:08.495 --> 27:09.763
I have to stay here.

27:11.131 --> 27:14.534
So the only way you and I work
is if--

27:14.567 --> 27:17.237
Is if we're together,
is if we're here.

27:17.270 --> 27:19.706
[sighs]

27:19.739 --> 27:21.574
I don't know how this could work
if you move.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.679
That's all I want to say.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.898
(Ryan)
You have a bigger size?
My man legs are too manly.

27:47.801 --> 27:49.069
This looks actually
very good.

27:49.069 --> 27:50.503
- Does it?
- It's sophisticated.

27:50.537 --> 27:52.439
Does this say,
"I majored in English Lit,

27:52.472 --> 27:54.574
and now I'm
a software programmer"?

27:54.607 --> 27:56.343
More like sociology.

27:56.376 --> 27:57.610
- Sociology?
- Yeah.

27:57.644 --> 27:58.878
Like I'm
a Communications major?

27:58.912 --> 28:00.513
Does this say
"Religious Studies major"?

28:00.547 --> 28:03.817
Does this say "Theater major
who now works for a hedge fund?"

28:03.850 --> 28:06.886
Screw you, grad school,
I'm gonna make my own path.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.321
"Here's $14 million
for an apartment."

28:08.355 --> 28:11.124
Is that what this says?
'Cause that's important to me.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.469
Look at the architecture,
every single townhouse.

28:22.502 --> 28:23.503
Yeah.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.040
And this is it.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.608
It's perfect.

28:28.641 --> 28:29.609
Come, let me
show you inside.

28:29.642 --> 28:31.044
Love it.

28:31.044 --> 28:33.279
(Luis)
After a lot of talking
about building my team,

28:33.313 --> 28:35.148
I am finally doing it.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.149
- Luis?
- Yes.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.150
Meet Reycellis.
Reycellis, Luis.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.184
Reycellis,
how are you?

28:38.218 --> 28:39.452
(Luis)
I'm starting small.

28:39.486 --> 28:41.388
So far,
I've hired one broker.

28:41.421 --> 28:42.722
For seven years,

28:42.756 --> 28:44.724
I worked for the Central Bank
of the Dominican Republic...

28:46.826 --> 28:49.729
(Luis)
The international market is huge
in New York City,

28:49.763 --> 28:52.332
which is why Reycellis
is such a perfect fit.

28:52.365 --> 28:54.267
I love this.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.635
You know what,
I love it too.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.640
Are we gonna sell it,
are we gonna sell it?

29:00.674 --> 29:02.008
- We're gonna sell it right now.
- Are we gonna sell it?

29:02.008 --> 29:03.443
- Are we gonna sell it?
- Right now.

29:03.476 --> 29:06.179
I have put all this time
to myself,

29:06.212 --> 29:09.015
to my team,
and to my business.

29:09.049 --> 29:11.851
I am so confident
this time around.

29:11.885 --> 29:12.852
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi.

29:12.886 --> 29:13.853
How are you?

29:13.887 --> 29:14.921
Luis Ortiz,
nice to meet you.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.322
Pleasure. Welcome.
Please, come in.

29:16.356 --> 29:17.490
This is my colleague,
Reycellis.

29:17.524 --> 29:18.558
- Welcome.
- Hi.

29:18.591 --> 29:19.693
Let me show you the house.

29:19.726 --> 29:20.894
Do you guys want to start
in bedroom number ten,

29:20.927 --> 29:22.228
nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one,

29:22.262 --> 29:23.596
it's up to you.
Ha.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.902
In my career, I don't think
I've ever been

29:28.935 --> 29:31.805
as proud as I am
of this particular house.

29:31.838 --> 29:35.041
7,500 square feet,
two fireplaces per floor.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.045
And look at this Jacuzzi.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.748
- [laughs]
- Yes, I know.

29:41.781 --> 29:42.816
Hello?

29:42.849 --> 29:44.718
Señor, how are you?

29:44.751 --> 29:46.219
Good to see you.
You're early, huh?

29:49.789 --> 29:52.592
Look at these details here.
Isn't it amazing?

29:52.625 --> 29:54.127
I love
the old woodworking.

29:57.097 --> 29:58.431
(Luis)
They chose to have
the second floor

29:58.465 --> 30:00.166
as the master suite.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.668
It's gorgeous.
It's big.

30:01.701 --> 30:03.470
The fact that it's
a single family house--

30:03.503 --> 30:04.838
It is a single family?

30:04.871 --> 30:07.140
- It is, yeah.
- Okay.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.842
(Luis)
Last time around,
I was very concerned

30:08.875 --> 30:12.612
that most buyers were going to
be turned off by the location,

30:12.645 --> 30:14.114
so I tried everything
that I could

30:14.147 --> 30:17.751
to bring any buyer I could
to this property.

30:17.784 --> 30:19.152
Now, tell me
about your clients.

30:19.185 --> 30:22.188
They're looking for a property
that can house them

30:22.222 --> 30:24.691
and their children
and their grandchildren.

30:24.724 --> 30:27.494
(Luis)
But this time,
instead of bringing everyone,

30:27.527 --> 30:29.996
I'm going to focus
on those who are

30:30.030 --> 30:31.965
specific buyers
for this house--

30:31.998 --> 30:35.735
families,
buyers that already know Harlem.

30:35.769 --> 30:39.239
With more help and more focus,
the plan is working.

30:43.176 --> 30:44.944
He's firm on the 3.5?

30:44.978 --> 30:47.781
Yes. As brokers,
I'm always up for making a deal,

30:47.814 --> 30:48.815
and I want to make
a deal happen,

30:48.848 --> 30:51.251
but he's not gonna
negotiate.

30:51.284 --> 30:54.020
I promised the Joneses I was
gonna get them $3.5 million.

30:54.054 --> 30:58.591
I promised myself that I was
gonna get them $3.5 million.

30:58.625 --> 31:01.628
There will be no negotiating,
period.

31:03.063 --> 31:05.065
I would like to have my buyers
come and see the place.

31:05.065 --> 31:06.132
Absolutely.

31:06.166 --> 31:10.070
I think this meets
their requirements.

31:10.070 --> 31:11.671
What do you think
this house is worth?

31:13.907 --> 31:16.242
Let me bring you an offer.

31:16.276 --> 31:19.546
Absolutely, but they don't want
anything less than 3.5.

31:22.549 --> 31:24.718
I hear you.

31:24.751 --> 31:27.454
Should we give you the keys,
lock the doors,

31:27.487 --> 31:29.356
not let anybody else
come in?

31:29.389 --> 31:30.357
That sounds good.

31:30.390 --> 31:31.858
[laughs]

31:37.764 --> 31:38.765
Wow.

31:40.934 --> 31:42.635
I want it dark.

31:43.770 --> 31:46.106
And I want this to glow
in the middle.

31:46.106 --> 31:47.140
I mean,
do you understand,

31:47.173 --> 31:48.641
never in the history
of New York real estate

31:48.675 --> 31:50.577
has there been
a bigger scale model?

31:50.610 --> 31:53.113
(Fredrik voice-over)
For the last few weeks,
I've been putting together

31:53.113 --> 31:55.815
the most spectacular showroom
for 5 Beekman,

31:55.849 --> 32:00.854
but spectacular costs money.
Sometimes a lot of money.

32:00.887 --> 32:02.088
Music!

32:03.456 --> 32:06.126
Come in. Thanks for coming
to the Beekman, welcome,

32:06.159 --> 32:07.193
Thank you.

32:07.227 --> 32:08.461
Mwah.

32:08.495 --> 32:12.065
I convinced the developer
to spend $2.5 million.

32:12.065 --> 32:13.600
Come on, let me show you
the model. Come on.

32:13.633 --> 32:16.803
Of the 36 buildings I've done,
I've never spent $2.5 million,

32:16.836 --> 32:21.141
which means I really have to
prove now that it was worth it.

32:21.174 --> 32:23.209
This is west,
this is north.

32:23.243 --> 32:24.911
You have a beautiful
two-story gym.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.312
What I would do
if I lived in the building,

32:26.346 --> 32:27.881
I would actually walk
through the hotel.

32:27.914 --> 32:30.183
Look at all this glass,
and look at that.

32:31.484 --> 32:32.585
- Uh-huh.
[both laughing]

32:32.619 --> 32:33.953
(Fredrik)
Almost every unit is a corner.

32:33.987 --> 32:36.790
The model is the most
impressive model I've seen.

32:36.823 --> 32:38.725
So you get a good sense
of what you're buying into.

32:51.338 --> 32:52.439
Welcome home, Susan.

32:52.472 --> 32:53.473
Wow.

32:53.506 --> 32:55.275
- Wow.
- Oh, it's amazing.

32:55.308 --> 32:58.978
Welcome to what's almost
an apartment at the Beekman.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.918
(Susan)
And the windows will be
the same, floor to ceiling?

33:04.951 --> 33:06.319
(Fredrik)
This is the exact
window system.

33:06.353 --> 33:08.788
It's a mockup, but look at this,
true floor-to-ceiling.

33:08.822 --> 33:10.757
When you bring your buyers back,
you're gonna be able,

33:10.790 --> 33:13.560
on this iPad, show different
viewpoints in the building.

33:13.593 --> 33:16.296
49 view, east.

33:18.198 --> 33:19.265
(Fredrik)
Look at that view.

33:19.299 --> 33:20.367
- Beautiful.
- Mm.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.302
Boom.

33:22.335 --> 33:23.370
This is incredible.

33:26.706 --> 33:28.141
The master bath.

33:31.478 --> 33:33.079
(Fredrik)
I love this detail.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.916
A tub with a view.

33:36.950 --> 33:38.651
And then, look at the size
of this shower.

33:38.685 --> 33:40.487
See how many brokers
we can fit in there.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.521
Oh, at least three.

33:41.554 --> 33:43.556
[laughter]
- There's room for more.

33:43.590 --> 33:45.892
(Fredrik voice-over)
I mean, I expected buyers
to love the amenities,

33:45.925 --> 33:48.862
and I did expect them to love
the views, but you know what?

33:48.895 --> 33:51.197
There's a lot
of luxury inventory out there

33:51.231 --> 33:52.799
that offers both of those.

33:52.832 --> 33:54.567
Just because they love
what they see

33:54.601 --> 33:56.770
doesn't mean they're
just gonna go ahead and buy it.

33:56.803 --> 33:59.172
Buyers need to be motivated.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.107
Keep in mind,
we only have 68 units.

34:04.044 --> 34:05.412
Ooh, not so many left.

34:05.445 --> 34:07.247
It's gonna be sold out.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.382
(Fredrik voice-over)
In new development,
it's all about creating urgency.

34:09.416 --> 34:11.284
That's why this party
was so important.

34:11.317 --> 34:12.786
On the opening night,
you realize,

34:12.819 --> 34:16.690
"Whoa, there is so much demand
and only 68 units."

34:19.125 --> 34:20.460
Choose?
Cesar, there's no time

34:20.493 --> 34:21.494
to choose.
He has to choose now.

34:23.430 --> 34:24.564
You need to act now.

34:24.597 --> 34:25.832
- You have a buyer?
- That's correct.

34:25.865 --> 34:27.267
She's looking
for a three-bedroom.

34:27.300 --> 34:28.868
What's the highest floor
three-bedroom

34:28.902 --> 34:30.070
you have available?

34:31.071 --> 34:32.439
Are you ready to fill in
the deal sheet?

34:35.809 --> 34:37.977
If you can get a contract
out to me tomorrow,

34:38.078 --> 34:39.579
I'll get it turned around
quickly.

34:39.612 --> 34:42.949
So many buyers, so little time,
so few apartments.

34:44.851 --> 34:46.786
Give me a guess
of how much this is.

34:46.820 --> 34:47.921
How much it is?

34:47.954 --> 34:48.922
(Fredrik)
How much was this to build?

34:48.955 --> 34:50.890
Oh, saved by the developer.

34:50.924 --> 34:52.992
Usually, I don't like
my developers

34:53.093 --> 34:56.096
at a party like this, because
if you hire me, you trust me,

34:56.129 --> 34:59.733
so them being here
checking in on me, mm.

34:59.766 --> 35:01.501
Let me do my thing.

35:01.534 --> 35:04.070
But this party was
such a success,

35:04.104 --> 35:06.106
that as it was winding down,

35:06.139 --> 35:09.142
I called Eric,
and asked him to come by.

35:11.044 --> 35:14.047
I told you this project
was gonna do really well.

35:14.047 --> 35:17.050
I said I'd like to do
$300 million sellout.

35:17.050 --> 35:18.385
Well, we have a good start.

35:18.418 --> 35:21.554
Everything with a color...

35:21.588 --> 35:23.556
is sold.

35:23.590 --> 35:25.925
Our first night,
because of our environment,

35:25.959 --> 35:29.429
because of the screens, because
of this very expensive model,

35:29.462 --> 35:31.831
we've sold...

35:31.865 --> 35:34.567
$44 million worth
of real estate.

35:34.601 --> 35:36.870
$44 million in sales?

35:36.903 --> 35:39.906
$44 million, 19 units,
almost 25%.

35:41.441 --> 35:44.177
We took a chance on you,
and you came through.

35:44.210 --> 35:47.213
That's right, baby.
Mm-hmm.

35:56.589 --> 35:57.691
[laughs]

35:58.758 --> 36:00.293
So glad everybody
finally went home.

36:01.361 --> 36:02.328
Whee!

36:02.362 --> 36:03.563
Oh, my God.

36:03.596 --> 36:06.032
(Fredrik voice-over)
$44 million in one night.

36:06.032 --> 36:08.435
There's a first
for everything.

36:08.468 --> 36:10.070
- Fist bump.
- Fist bump.

36:10.103 --> 36:11.604
Thank you.

36:21.381 --> 36:25.885
It's a little bit hard for me
to concentrate on work right now

36:25.919 --> 36:29.522
with the bomb that Emilia
just dropped on me,

36:29.556 --> 36:33.727
but until we figure things out,
focusing on work is pretty much

36:33.760 --> 36:39.065
the only thing that's keeping me
from dwelling on this 24/7.

36:39.099 --> 36:42.102
[phone ringing]

36:43.303 --> 36:44.504
This is Ryan.

36:46.539 --> 36:48.875
Good. How are you?
Who's this?

36:57.384 --> 36:59.085
Hi, welcome.

36:59.085 --> 37:00.186
Victor?

37:00.220 --> 37:01.321
I'm here.

37:01.354 --> 37:04.124
Yes.
Yes, I have.

37:08.128 --> 37:10.296
I'm looking at
about 50,000 bitcoins.

37:10.330 --> 37:12.198
- Bitcoin?
- In bitcoin.

37:12.232 --> 37:14.768
That puts it in
at around 13 million and change.

37:14.801 --> 37:16.169
But you want to pay
in bitcoin?

37:16.202 --> 37:17.270
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

37:25.879 --> 37:27.247
Okay.

37:29.683 --> 37:31.751
Right.

37:31.785 --> 37:34.187
At the end of the day, you just
have to look at gross value.

37:34.220 --> 37:38.391
We're asking $14 million
for a two-bedroom apartment.

37:45.498 --> 37:47.067
And that is a concern
for me as well,

37:47.100 --> 37:49.202
which is why we've been
going at this full force,

37:49.235 --> 37:50.637
and it will just take time.

37:50.670 --> 37:52.405
There are only so many buyers
out there

37:52.439 --> 37:54.174
who have $14 million
in their pocket,

37:54.207 --> 37:56.409
looking to buy a two-bedroom
in New York.

37:56.443 --> 37:58.345
That's just the fact
of the matter.

38:14.027 --> 38:17.230
Sometimes this would be
so much easier

38:17.263 --> 38:20.567
if people just listened to me
from the start.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.035
Your boss can make
a lot of money

38:22.035 --> 38:24.104
if they price it
at $12 million.

38:24.137 --> 38:26.673
I think we could go up,
I mean, 16 million.

38:38.818 --> 38:40.487
Okay.

38:44.391 --> 38:47.494
Our exclusive agreements
explicitly state

38:47.527 --> 38:49.963
that we are due
a brokerage commission

38:50.063 --> 38:54.167
should the apartment be rented
before the end of the agreement,

38:54.200 --> 38:58.505
so I'm not gonna argue
with $50,000 a month.

38:58.538 --> 39:00.006
$50,000 a month
sounds great.

39:04.177 --> 39:06.680
As a pocket listing,
it's no longer gonna be

39:06.713 --> 39:10.283
visible to the public at large,
but if I still have somebody

39:10.316 --> 39:11.785
who wants to come
and see the apartment

39:11.818 --> 39:14.054
and make an offer,
I can still show it.

39:14.087 --> 39:17.023
I'm actually making
additional money

39:17.057 --> 39:19.659
while I'm still
trying to sell it.

39:19.693 --> 39:21.094
So we will rent it
to your friend

39:21.127 --> 39:24.264
for $50,000 a month,
which is $600,000 a year

39:24.297 --> 39:25.899
for a two-bedroom apartment?

39:25.932 --> 39:27.667
That's the world
I now live in?

39:30.837 --> 39:31.838
Yes.

39:36.042 --> 39:37.544
I love when billionaires
end phone calls

39:37.577 --> 39:40.113
with, "Later on."

39:43.416 --> 39:45.251
So what brings you here?

39:45.285 --> 39:46.586
Let's see how I put this.

39:58.565 --> 40:03.236
(Luis)
I don't drive out of the city
often for business,

40:03.269 --> 40:06.539
but I have some news
I want to give to the Joneses,

40:06.573 --> 40:08.908
and I want to deliver it
personally.

40:10.710 --> 40:12.078
What a life!

40:12.112 --> 40:14.047
- Hey.
- [laughs]

40:14.080 --> 40:16.316
Welcome to our
weekend cottage.

40:16.349 --> 40:18.685
(Luis)
So when they told me that
they were spending time here,

40:18.718 --> 40:21.354
I said,
"Send me the address."

40:21.388 --> 40:23.556
Wow, this is amazing.

40:27.761 --> 40:28.995
Thank you very much.

40:29.029 --> 40:33.700
So what brings you here, Luis?
You always come with news.

40:33.733 --> 40:36.836
Let's see how I put this?

40:36.870 --> 40:41.908
The bad news is that...

40:41.941 --> 40:43.309
you may not see me
as often

40:43.343 --> 40:45.578
if I actually sell your house
for full ask.

40:49.849 --> 40:52.218
I'm afraid I got you
a $3.5 million offer.

40:55.255 --> 40:57.891
We've been down this road
before.

40:57.924 --> 41:00.593
This time, I double checked,
triple checked,

41:00.627 --> 41:03.697
quadruple checked.

41:03.730 --> 41:05.498
This guy is our buyer.

41:05.532 --> 41:06.900
Tell me about your client.

41:06.933 --> 41:09.969
They're looking for a property
that can house them

41:10.070 --> 41:12.405
and their children
and their grandchildren.

41:13.540 --> 41:14.774
You agree to this offer,

41:14.808 --> 41:18.078
I'll have a deposit
wired to you tomorrow.

41:18.111 --> 41:20.146
Do we agree?

41:20.180 --> 41:21.214
We agree.

41:22.582 --> 41:24.184
We knew that
you could do it, Luis.

41:24.217 --> 41:25.785
Thank you, Luis.

41:25.819 --> 41:27.487
And you were right.

41:28.588 --> 41:30.990
Listen, I'm back.

41:31.091 --> 41:32.459
Let's take a walk.

41:32.492 --> 41:33.927
What am I getting,
a new car?

41:33.960 --> 41:35.195
Hey, you never know.

41:38.465 --> 41:40.266
(Luis)
What are you showing me, guys?

41:40.300 --> 41:45.138
It may not look like much now,
but this is going to be

41:45.171 --> 41:49.175
the most magnificent house
on the Hudson River.

41:51.111 --> 41:53.113
(Mrs. Jones)
We are 20 miles
outside the city,

41:53.146 --> 41:54.948
but yet you feel like
you're a world away.

41:54.981 --> 41:56.316
When you get here,
you can just--

41:56.349 --> 41:59.285
[breathes deeply]
exhale.

41:59.319 --> 42:02.055
(Luis)
Well, now I do know
how to exhale.

42:02.055 --> 42:03.556
Trust me.

42:03.590 --> 42:04.858
It's beautiful.

42:07.327 --> 42:09.262
There's only one broker
for the Joneses.

42:11.064 --> 42:12.298
We need you.

42:17.837 --> 42:20.306
I appreciate the loyalty.
I'm in.

42:23.643 --> 42:25.912
[laughter]

42:25.945 --> 42:28.548
(Ryan)
Next, on<i>Million Dollar</i>
<i>Listing New York.</i>

42:28.581 --> 42:29.582
Zack.

42:29.616 --> 42:30.884
- You ready for this one?
- Wow.

42:30.917 --> 42:33.319
These views!
You have the Statue of Liberty

42:33.353 --> 42:35.689
from every room.
I think I'm getting aroused.

42:40.326 --> 42:41.494
Hello, this is Luis.

42:42.495 --> 42:43.496
Yes.

42:44.964 --> 42:47.100
[laughs]

42:47.133 --> 42:50.804
This is why I have somebody
answering my phones.

42:56.710 --> 42:57.711
Motherf***er!

42:57.744 --> 42:59.212
Oh, Jesus.

42:59.245 --> 43:00.780
