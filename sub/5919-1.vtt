01:08.837 --> 01:11.871
- I can't do it.
- No, you can. The question is will you?

01:11.872 --> 01:16.008
<i>This is no great illusion</i>

01:16.009 --> 01:20.313
<i>When I'm with you
I'm looking for a ghost</i>

01:20.314 --> 01:24.417
<i>Or invisible reasons</i>

01:24.418 --> 01:28.921
<i>To fall out of love and run
screaming from our home</i>

01:28.922 --> 01:31.224
<i>'Cause we live in a house of mirrors</i>

01:31.225 --> 01:34.494
<i>We see our fears and
everything's our songs</i>

01:34.495 --> 01:37.329
<i>Faces and second-hand clothes</i>

01:37.330 --> 01:39.499
<i>But more and more we're suffering</i>

01:39.500 --> 01:41.834
<i>Not nobody, not a thousand beers</i>

01:41.835 --> 01:45.505
<i>Will keep us from
feeling so all alone</i>

01:45.506 --> 01:50.042
<i>But you are what you love</i>

01:50.043 --> 01:54.113
<i>And not what loves you back</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:56.816
<i>That's why I'm here on your doorstep</i>

01:56.817 --> 02:00.531
<i>Pleading for you to take me back</i>

02:11.931 --> 02:13.867
Is that a good one?

02:19.205 --> 02:21.207
What the hell was that?

02:21.208 --> 02:23.476
Flock of these.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.548
Very funny.

02:27.948 --> 02:32.952
<i>You are what you love</i>

02:33.586 --> 02:37.423
Look at that guy. Slut Speedo.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.090
Cold water makes them shrivel up.

02:39.091 --> 02:40.691
How would you know?

02:42.750 --> 02:44.329
We're really going to do this?

02:44.330 --> 02:49.040
You can wuss up but I'll
be 20 bucks richer.

02:53.335 --> 02:56.942
You're just gonna take it off right
here, with everyone looking?

02:56.943 --> 02:59.613
That was the idea.

03:01.013 --> 03:02.348
Yeah.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.950
I can't do it.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.604
Yeah, you can.
The question is will you?

03:18.097 --> 03:20.632
Oh, no.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.602
You think because your eyes are
closed no one can see you?

03:23.603 --> 03:26.144
Screw you.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.894
Get in.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.563
I can't swim!

03:50.564 --> 03:53.332
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

03:53.333 --> 03:58.004
I don't like waves. I hate waves.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.605
And you just remembered this?

03:59.606 --> 04:01.643
Oh, no.

04:04.043 --> 04:05.210
You're naked!

04:05.211 --> 04:08.084
I know!

04:11.484 --> 04:13.286
We just came over to tell you

04:13.287 --> 04:17.022
you have the best ass on this beach.

04:17.023 --> 04:19.026
What means this?

04:19.426 --> 04:20.625
You French?

04:20.625 --> 04:24.663
We are Romania. No English.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.197
Nice.

04:26.198 --> 04:27.599
- Wanna go for a walk?
- Mm-mm.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.334
Mm-mm.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.937
She can use her tongue,
though, right?

04:30.938 --> 04:37.176
- Mm-mm.
- Where you going? Come on.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.947
I'm doing it.
Look, mom.

04:40.347 --> 04:43.449
You didn't want to stay and see what
your special prize was going to be?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.483
You mean my really
special gang rape?

04:45.484 --> 04:47.152
Oh...

04:47.153 --> 04:50.122
Hey, what's the matter with you?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.558
How about "I'm sorry,"
"excuse me" or something?

04:52.559 --> 04:55.060
You can use your tongue.
Can't you?

04:55.061 --> 04:58.098
Sorry.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.399
You're selling ice cream.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.601
Yeah, amazing powers of observation.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.637
Can I have one?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.471
Which one?

05:06.472 --> 05:08.574
What's good?

05:08.575 --> 05:11.978
Uh, they're all shit.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.948
Recycled industrial waste.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.695
The red, white, and blue, please.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.428
That camera yours?

05:30.429 --> 05:32.231
No.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.666
You don't have to be such a dick.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.137
She's just trying to be nice.

05:37.537 --> 05:40.171
Let's go.

05:40.172 --> 05:42.048
Thank you.

05:58.391 --> 06:01.027
Your mouth is so blue.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.697
I think someone hurt him.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.562
That makes it okay for
him to be an asshole?

06:10.669 --> 06:12.205
Oh, come on.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.673
You liked him, too.

06:14.674 --> 06:18.077
Hey.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.144
Lilly.

06:19.145 --> 06:21.416
Jesus Christ.

06:23.816 --> 06:25.584
Hey, what time is it?

06:25.585 --> 06:30.488
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe, like, 6:00?

06:30.489 --> 06:32.224
Shit.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.125
I hope Norma's still
with a patient.

06:34.126 --> 06:37.563
Good luck. I'm going to take
my award-winning ass home.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.365
Okay.

06:42.335 --> 06:45.139
Please don't do that.

06:45.539 --> 06:46.528
Return my bike.

06:46.529 --> 06:47.807
Lillian, where have you been?

06:47.808 --> 06:49.575
I told you this morning,
brighten beach.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.277
You took it all the way to Rockaway?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.844
All the way to Rockaway.

06:52.845 --> 06:55.313
Okay, if you knew you
were going to be this late,

06:55.314 --> 06:58.384
- you could've had the courtesy to call.
- My phone died.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.486
Joy would like to spend some
time with her family, too.

07:00.487 --> 07:04.089
- Well, dad's still in the office.
- That is beside the point.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.491
You need to eat something
besides noodles.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.594
I don't like fish.
It's disgusting.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.529
- It's your dinner.
- My disgusting dinner.

07:11.530 --> 07:12.731
You know what?
That's enough.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.265
- Joy?
- Yeah.

07:14.266 --> 07:17.303
Why don't you go home to your family,
and the girls will clean up.

07:17.304 --> 07:18.837
Lillian, please go tell your father

07:18.838 --> 07:20.505
that we are going to be
late for the concert.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.373
He can't still be with a patient.

07:22.374 --> 07:24.110
You stay there and eat some protein.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.577
And take your shoes off.

07:25.578 --> 07:29.058
You're tracking sand
all over the house.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.386
Did you tell him?

08:13.626 --> 08:15.279
He was with someone.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.475
What is wrong with you?

08:23.602 --> 08:26.772
Edward, please go get changed.
We're going to be late.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.339
It starts at 8:00.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.563
Okay, I'm going.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.132
Uh...

08:53.532 --> 08:55.208
Sorry, I'm...

09:01.356 --> 09:03.608
Edward, come on.
We're going to be late.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.518
Coming.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.724
Al Franken.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.892
Al Franken is a God damn comic.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.729
He's good, but what's the
name of that show he was on?

09:23.730 --> 09:26.531
And she's the best civil
rights attorney in New York.

09:26.532 --> 09:29.468
What is she going to do, go to
Wisconsin and work for some guy

09:29.469 --> 09:30.969
who's on comedy central?

09:30.970 --> 09:33.305
NBC. SNL is on NBC.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.507
Jon Stewart's on comedy central.

09:35.508 --> 09:38.310
Thank you so much for that critically
important piece of information.

09:38.311 --> 09:41.747
Hey, get your ta-tas all
sun burnt at the beach?

09:41.748 --> 09:43.715
Ta-tas. Really?
That's cute.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.416
You told him?

09:45.417 --> 09:48.020
No. You know you're
an asshole, right?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.555
How about we change the subject?

09:50.556 --> 09:52.757
Sure, we could talk
about politics again.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.660
Well, we could talk about
your two favorite subjects...

09:54.661 --> 09:56.362
television and body parts.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.896
- Asshole.
- That's a body part.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.531
He's 16.
What's your excuse?

09:59.532 --> 10:01.267
Karl, come on.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.435
So how's that
tour-guide thing going?

10:04.436 --> 10:08.007
My boss is a perv, and I
have to wear a uniform.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.008
Well you have a straight shot

10:10.009 --> 10:12.610
into the masonic lodges
of the United States.

10:12.611 --> 10:15.748
That's true political power.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.983
So when do you head out for school?

10:17.984 --> 10:19.584
Oh, that's right. Yale.

10:19.585 --> 10:20.719
Whiffenpoofs.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.921
An Ivy-covered thing...

10:22.922 --> 10:24.656
Lay off her, dad.

10:24.657 --> 10:27.026
Orientation is the first
week in September.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.560
They're not telling you you have
to change your orientation.

10:29.561 --> 10:30.896
I said stop it.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.766
She doesn't come from a family where
you have to train for dinner.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.434
What's the point of dinner then?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.069
Okay, great, you guys
enjoy your meal.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.042
Let's go.

10:43.442 --> 10:47.313
You just walked in on your father
boning some random patient,

10:47.314 --> 10:50.020
and you don't know
what you're upset for?

10:50.749 --> 10:52.520
Does your mom know?

10:53.920 --> 10:57.925
- Are you going to tell her?
- Are you crazy?

10:58.127 --> 10:59.391
Everybody okay out here?

10:59.392 --> 11:03.036
Dad, go away.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.405
Your parents screw around.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.575
I think they just
talk about it a lot.

11:24.383 --> 11:27.457
I can't believe that you
were talking about sex.

11:28.754 --> 11:33.124
Well, apparently in my house you
don't really talk about it.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.700
You just do it.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.666
We're the last ones.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.402
On earth?

11:43.403 --> 11:46.104
At Erasmus, at St. Anne's.

11:46.105 --> 11:49.076
That's basically the same thing.

11:50.476 --> 11:54.681
We're going to fucking college,
and we're still virgins.

11:56.081 --> 11:58.050
We've got to get over this hump.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.618
You didn't say that.

12:02.788 --> 12:05.555
Persons of the male
gender are required.

12:35.955 --> 12:38.089
Out the windows to
your right and left

12:38.090 --> 12:39.690
are the air ducts to
the Holland tunnel,

12:39.691 --> 12:42.927
and if you smell roasting coffee,
that's because general foods

12:42.928 --> 12:46.698
built their coffee processing
plant in Hoboken in 1846.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.200
There are some people who say
you can still smell the coffee

12:49.201 --> 12:50.602
from the other side of the river

12:50.603 --> 12:53.004
even though the plant
closed in 1992.

12:53.005 --> 12:55.641
You're probably ready for an
iced coffee right about now.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.176
This is the end of our tour.
Gratuities are appreciated.

12:58.177 --> 12:59.744
Please be careful
getting of the boat,

12:59.745 --> 13:02.714
and enjoy the rest of your
visit to the big apple.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.522
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

14:20.927 --> 14:24.930
Norma? Don't you ever
have to call home?

14:24.931 --> 14:27.199
Only when I need bail money.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.939
Shit, I forgot to tell you
what happened last night.

14:33.940 --> 14:37.675
So I... God, I went out to
dinner with Danny and Kate.

14:37.676 --> 14:41.713
This, like, obscure Italian
place in the village,

14:41.714 --> 14:47.287
and the waiter turned out to be him.

14:48.687 --> 14:50.789
Who's that?

14:50.790 --> 14:53.227
Um, the ice-cream guy on the beach.

14:54.627 --> 14:58.897
His name's David, David Avery.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.032
You just ran into him?

15:01.033 --> 15:04.838
Not exactly.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.171
What do you mean?

15:07.172 --> 15:10.041
He had a book of matches

15:10.042 --> 15:12.810
from Grotta Azzurra next to his
camera at the beach that day.

15:12.811 --> 15:14.646
I can't believe you dragged
your parents to a restaurant

15:14.647 --> 15:16.281
because you saw a book of matches.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.050
Okay, you don't have to
make me feel bad about it.

15:18.051 --> 15:21.820
I'm not. I'm just...
it's like...

15:21.821 --> 15:24.895
Didn't you have something
you wanted to tell me?

15:25.792 --> 15:28.759
Uh, Fitzsimmons.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.996
He came on to you again?

15:30.997 --> 15:34.800
No, he... he just wants
me to give a tour

15:34.801 --> 15:36.801
to a boat load of FBI agents.

15:36.802 --> 15:39.972
Danny's going to love that.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.837
I'm starving.
Do you want to split a burger?

15:52.985 --> 15:54.920
Who said you could come in?

15:54.921 --> 15:56.754
Mom's crying.

15:56.755 --> 15:59.657
She's actually crying?

15:59.658 --> 16:01.026
Where's dad?

16:01.027 --> 16:02.828
I don't know.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.599
- Where is she?
- In her room.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.367
What happened?
Did they have a fight?

16:08.368 --> 16:11.103
No, they were just standing there.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.842
And mom went to her bedroom.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.679
What are you going to do?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.070
Nothing.
It's none of our business.

16:23.715 --> 16:25.717
I'm scared.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.352
What are you scared of?

16:27.353 --> 16:30.656
I don't know.
I'm just scared.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.224
Come on.
I'll paint your nails.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.691
- Red?
- Yeah.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.957
- Really?
- Sure.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.958
<i>I feel like walking</i>

17:07.959 --> 17:11.295
<i>Do you feel like coming?</i>

17:11.296 --> 17:13.999
<i>I feel like talking</i>

17:14.000 --> 17:18.584
<i>'Cause it's been a long time</i>

17:31.984 --> 17:35.320
<i>Now your hair is long</i>

17:35.321 --> 17:38.456
<i>And you look so thin</i>

17:38.457 --> 17:41.259
<i>You're always so pale</i>

17:41.260 --> 17:43.462
<i>But something has changed</i>

17:43.463 --> 17:46.065
<i>You're almost a man</i>

17:46.465 --> 17:48.471
Hungry?

17:52.871 --> 17:55.109
- You made that?
- Maybe.

17:56.509 --> 18:00.145
No one buys ice creams on Tuesdays.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.147
What are you doing?

18:02.148 --> 18:05.751
- No one takes boat tours on Tuesdays.
- What?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.218
Are you the one who says
how many rivets there are

18:07.219 --> 18:10.491
- in the George Washington bridge?
- Yeah.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.828
- What's your name?
- Lilly.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.100
I'm David.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.142
I'm going to grab a shirt.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.577
You ever been to the cyclone?

18:31.977 --> 18:34.648
Yeah.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.152
You wanna go?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.918
Got my bike.

18:40.919 --> 18:42.414
Come back for it.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.028
I don't think I should.

18:50.428 --> 18:53.440
Sure. Suit yourself.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.452
682 rugby.

19:13.852 --> 19:19.558
<i>It still hurts</i>

19:19.559 --> 19:22.226
<i>It hurts</i>

19:22.227 --> 19:28.032
<i>It still hurts</i>

19:28.033 --> 19:30.534
<i>It hurts</i>

19:30.535 --> 19:33.207
<i>It still hurts</i>

19:34.607 --> 19:36.209
<i>La la la la</i>

19:39.946 --> 19:42.748
<i>La la la la</i>

19:43.148 --> 19:44.916
That's all I got.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.350
It's not very good.
It's kind of shitty...

19:46.351 --> 19:49.190
Will you stop it?
I think it's great.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.862
Why do you do that?
You're good.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.463
I called him at the restaurant.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.867
He wasn't there. He's never anywhere
when you want to reach him.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.335
I know you think I'm an idiot.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.200
You barely know the guy.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.176
I know.

20:10.576 --> 20:13.445
So how come Norma
hasn't called you yet?

20:13.446 --> 20:15.045
She's M.I.A.

20:15.046 --> 20:17.048
Hasn't left her room in a week,

20:17.049 --> 20:21.085
but I better go check the battlefield
in case there are casualties.

20:21.086 --> 20:23.323
Keep the faith.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.357
Call me tomorrow.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.858
Okay.

20:39.671 --> 20:41.539
People have affairs.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.174
This is the 21st century.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.643
It's not the fucking
end of the world.

20:44.644 --> 20:48.379
Lillian, I would appreciate it if
you wouldn't speak to me that way.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.116
Mom, there is a whole family here.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.652
He said he was sorry.
I heard him.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.587
She's probably just
some random person.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.222
He only did it to get
your attention.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.956
This doesn't concern you.

20:58.957 --> 21:01.659
It doesn't concern me? He's
my father. I want him to stay.

21:01.660 --> 21:06.964
Well, we all know how
you feel about him.

21:06.965 --> 21:09.367
I can't believe you just said that.

21:09.368 --> 21:13.104
- You're a God damn shrink.
- You know what, Lillian?

21:13.105 --> 21:15.473
If you can't find a way
to control yourself,

21:15.474 --> 21:17.641
I'm going to have to ask
you to leave the room.

21:17.642 --> 21:19.979
Thank God, I can't control myself.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.375
You live in a porno movie.

22:23.376 --> 22:26.011
It's a photographer's studio.

22:26.012 --> 22:29.215
Frank Mayo.
You heard of him?

22:29.615 --> 22:33.847
Lets me sleep here in exchange for
kinda acting like a security guard.

22:35.388 --> 22:38.199
- Weird place to sleep.
- Oh, I'm up there.

22:44.463 --> 22:47.331
Want a beer?

22:47.332 --> 22:52.137
Think they did, like, a lipstick
commercial here today, so...

22:52.138 --> 22:53.538
He's got a dark room, too.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.139
He doesn't use it anymore,

22:55.140 --> 22:59.077
so kind of teaching myself to print.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.847
All the good stuff was shot on film.

23:02.247 --> 23:03.900
Where's your family?

23:05.784 --> 23:09.820
Now? Eastern parkway.

23:09.821 --> 23:12.424
I grew up on Staten island, though.

23:12.425 --> 23:15.341
I moved there from
Tennessee when I was five.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.796
Staten island?

23:18.196 --> 23:19.297
Yeah.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.465
People actually live there.

23:21.466 --> 23:24.382
Moved out, though,
when I was in high school.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.170
How come?

23:26.171 --> 23:29.339
It was just safer for
everyone that way.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.861
You think your mom's trouble.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.704
These all yours?

24:24.730 --> 24:27.835
Yeah.

24:30.235 --> 24:32.257
You really want to do this.

24:34.406 --> 24:37.638
I don't want to do anything
except get out of here.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.811
Where you want to go?

24:40.812 --> 24:43.580
Rome, Paris,

24:43.581 --> 24:45.183
I don't know.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.886
Why?

24:47.887 --> 24:50.355
Smell it.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.857
Breathe it.

24:52.858 --> 24:55.452
Tired of seeing it in photographs.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.290
Sylvia Plath.
Do you know this?

25:25.690 --> 25:27.909
Would you read it to me?

25:43.309 --> 25:45.944
"Daddy,

25:45.945 --> 25:49.547
"you do not do, you do not do

25:49.548 --> 25:53.283
"any more, black shoe

25:53.284 --> 25:56.320
"in which I have lived like a foot

25:56.321 --> 25:57.454
"for thirty years

25:57.455 --> 25:59.490
"poor and white

25:59.491 --> 26:01.959
barely daring to breathe or achoo"

26:33.359 --> 26:35.971
I think you better get home.

26:46.371 --> 26:50.142
You told Gerry you were
going to see her on Friday.

26:50.542 --> 26:53.580
So.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.955
Are you?

27:36.355 --> 27:38.022
It was weird.

27:38.023 --> 27:40.657
We met at the restaurant,
and then we just walked around.

27:40.658 --> 27:43.493
And it was pretty obvious
that I was down to hook up,

27:43.494 --> 27:44.962
and he didn't even touch me.

27:44.963 --> 27:46.664
Maybe I should've come on to him?

27:46.665 --> 27:49.701
I mean, aren't guys supposed to like
it when you make the first move?

27:49.702 --> 27:53.338
I even wore my purple
sweater that's so low cut

27:53.339 --> 27:55.729
my tits practically hang out of it.

27:56.774 --> 27:59.042
Shit.

27:59.043 --> 28:01.449
Maybe that was too much.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.683
- Oh, my God.
- What?

28:05.684 --> 28:07.351
There he is.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.920
I told him I was meeting
you here for open mic.

28:09.921 --> 28:11.436
- What do I do?
- Nothing.

28:11.437 --> 28:12.990
What do you mean nothing?
The song is about him.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.287
It's fine.

28:14.288 --> 28:16.394
Hey, you remember my
friend Lilly Berger?

28:16.395 --> 28:18.028
David Avery.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.899
I'm so happy you're here. All right, okay.
I'm going to...

28:22.900 --> 28:24.569
I'm going to go set up.
I'm really nervous.

28:24.570 --> 28:27.571
So don't laugh at me.

28:27.572 --> 28:29.642
I'm going to trip.

28:31.042 --> 28:35.512
<i>If you wanna find yourself
by traveling out west</i>

28:35.513 --> 28:43.521
<i>Or if you wanna find somebody
else that's better, go ahead</i>

28:43.921 --> 28:47.661
<i>Go ahead</i>

28:49.061 --> 28:53.531
<i>If you wanna buy a band
new fancy automobile</i>

28:53.532 --> 28:55.733
<i>Or if you wanna build a place</i>

28:55.734 --> 29:02.005
<i>Down in east Hampton, go ahead</i>

29:02.006 --> 29:04.575
<i>Go ahead</i>

29:04.576 --> 29:06.843
<i>Go ahead</i>

29:06.844 --> 29:09.513
<i>Be my guest</i>

29:09.514 --> 29:14.718
<i>Go ahead</i>

29:14.719 --> 29:18.955
<i>If you wanna have your
cake and eat it, too</i>

29:18.956 --> 29:21.458
<i>Or if you wanna have other people</i>

29:21.459 --> 29:22.960
<i>Watch you while you eat it</i>

29:22.961 --> 29:26.232
<i>Go ahead</i>

29:27.632 --> 29:31.404
<i>Go ahead</i>

29:32.804 --> 29:34.739
<i>If you wanna hold on</i>

29:34.740 --> 29:37.508
<i>To the first girl that you meet</i>

29:37.509 --> 29:39.551
<i>Or if you wanna settle down</i>

29:39.552 --> 29:41.178
<i>And plant roses at my feet</i>

29:41.179 --> 29:43.651
<i>Go ahead</i>

29:46.051 --> 29:48.753
<i>Go ahead</i>

29:48.754 --> 29:51.088
<i>Go ahead</i>

29:51.089 --> 29:53.191
<i>I wish you would</i>

29:53.192 --> 29:58.197
<i>Just go ahead</i>

29:58.597 --> 30:01.866
- You're really good.
- Thanks.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.067
This is a great jacket.

30:03.068 --> 30:08.373
It's my dad's.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.787
I gotta go.

30:23.187 --> 30:25.022
What was that?

30:25.023 --> 30:30.727
I mean, count on me to
find someone certifiable.

30:30.728 --> 30:33.030
I can't imagine your
dad in that jacket.

30:33.031 --> 30:36.266
I actually just can't
imagine him without a tie.

30:36.267 --> 30:39.971
Have you seen him?

30:39.972 --> 30:43.206
He uses the office, but she
won't let him come upstairs.

30:43.207 --> 30:44.975
Well, maybe she's right, you know?

30:44.976 --> 30:49.280
You should be able to trust the
people that mean something to you.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.147
What?

30:51.148 --> 30:53.117
Nothing.

30:53.118 --> 30:55.086
Well, do you wanna
get something to eat?

30:55.087 --> 30:57.722
Think I'm gonna go home.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.689
Well, I can't sleep.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.192
The guys who went on before me

31:01.193 --> 31:02.993
said that there's a
producer in the audience

31:02.994 --> 31:04.628
and that they're meeting
up with him at Wally's,

31:04.629 --> 31:07.063
so I think I might just
go meet up with them.

31:07.064 --> 31:10.067
Okay, wish me luck.

31:10.068 --> 31:11.903
Luck.

31:11.904 --> 31:13.104
Ow.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.573
Sorry.
That was hard.

31:56.314 --> 31:59.583
Good job, Lil.
Sit down?

31:59.584 --> 32:00.917
No, thanks.

32:00.918 --> 32:02.753
Hot as shit in that uniform.

32:02.754 --> 32:03.954
I'm fine.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.991
Yeah?

32:06.992 --> 32:08.693
All right.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.794
That trip was worth two tours.

32:10.795 --> 32:14.197
You want more like that?
Specials?

32:14.198 --> 32:15.221
Hmm?

32:15.222 --> 32:16.801
Night cruises are triple time.

32:16.802 --> 32:19.575
I take classes.

32:23.975 --> 32:26.847
You're a real pistol.

32:30.247 --> 32:33.621
Mm.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.221
Won't bite ya.

32:37.222 --> 32:39.189
I'm late.

32:39.190 --> 32:42.230
- All right. Some other time then.
- Yeah.

32:45.630 --> 32:49.166
You know what you should do.
You should call the ACLU.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.402
She wasn't exactly molested.

32:51.403 --> 32:56.107
Well, verbally she was molested.

32:56.108 --> 32:57.308
What?

32:57.309 --> 32:59.676
That's disgusting.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.212
It's gluten-free.

33:01.213 --> 33:04.214
You know, I'd rather not have a
lecture about my intestines.

33:04.215 --> 33:06.817
I would just like some normal bread.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.629
Such a pain in the ass.

33:13.958 --> 33:17.128
I mean, what is wrong with white?

33:17.129 --> 33:19.195
Come to my house.
Everything's white.

33:19.196 --> 33:22.332
Anyway, this is kind of a big deal,
because you do have an obligation

33:22.333 --> 33:24.702
to the women who are gonna
work for this guy in the future

33:24.703 --> 33:26.936
to make it clear that what
he said was inappropriate.

33:26.937 --> 33:28.438
It's not okay.

33:28.439 --> 33:30.907
It was more how he said
it than what he said.

33:30.908 --> 33:33.711
No, I know exactly
what you're saying.

33:33.712 --> 33:37.814
Can we please just have,
like, a little bit of privacy?

33:37.815 --> 33:40.488
Little bit.

33:42.888 --> 33:45.864
Just think about it, Lilly.

33:53.264 --> 33:56.099
Were you scared?

33:56.500 --> 33:58.604
Yeah.

34:00.205 --> 34:04.308
But it must feel kinda good
to have a guy want your body.

34:04.309 --> 34:07.522
Mm, no.

34:17.922 --> 34:21.492
He makin' a house call?

34:21.493 --> 34:23.460
What are you doing here?

34:23.462 --> 34:25.728
I just came to watch your
parents scream at each other.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.601
You just turn up
whenever you want to?

34:32.002 --> 34:33.870
Yeah.

34:33.871 --> 34:36.841
Yeah, I'm out of here.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.831
I just feel like I
don't understand you.

35:00.232 --> 35:04.419
I believe you want me to tell
you things you already know.

35:21.819 --> 35:25.169
Where can we go?

36:10.569 --> 36:12.269
Wait.

36:12.270 --> 36:14.104
Wait.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.173
I've got something.
It's all right.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.478
I'm scared.

36:22.179 --> 36:26.185
You haven't done it before?

36:27.585 --> 36:30.588
Do you want it to be me?

36:30.589 --> 36:33.225
Yeah, but I'm really scared.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.872
Okay.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.513
<i>He's got you where he wants you</i>

38:02.514 --> 38:06.316
<i>And he'll have you when he wants to</i>

38:06.317 --> 38:10.486
<i>But you'll want him too</i>

38:10.487 --> 38:16.326
<i>Yeah you'll want him too</i>

38:30.641 --> 38:34.111
<i>He's got you where he wants you</i>

38:34.112 --> 38:38.082
<i>And he'll have you when he wants to</i>

38:38.083 --> 38:42.328
<i>But you'll want him too</i>

38:55.699 --> 38:58.669
You're going to be
very late for work.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.738
She didn't come home
until 2:00 last night.

39:00.739 --> 39:03.207
How do you know?
You were sleeping.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.575
She woke me.
She took a shower.

39:05.576 --> 39:07.310
I was hot.

39:07.311 --> 39:10.680
Would you like to tell me
where you were so late?

39:10.681 --> 39:12.349
Gerry's.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.350
I don't know how late
they let her stay out,

39:14.351 --> 39:16.653
but in this house,
your curfew is midnight.

39:16.654 --> 39:18.287
Is that understood?

39:18.288 --> 39:19.756
I'm going to college.
There is no curfew.

39:19.757 --> 39:22.191
You're not there yet.

39:22.192 --> 39:25.285
Can I play at Jackie's
after my swimming lesson?

40:21.667 --> 40:23.720
You're like a stalker.
What do you want?

40:23.721 --> 40:25.122
I'm gonna be late.

40:25.123 --> 40:28.225
Listen, Lil, this
thing that happened

40:28.625 --> 40:32.595
between your mother and
I, it's not your problem.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.664
- It's not?
- No.

40:34.665 --> 40:36.466
You just walk away and
leave me to deal with her

40:36.467 --> 40:38.602
and then say it's not my problem.

40:38.603 --> 40:40.137
I'm sorry.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.537
This is all bullshit.

40:41.538 --> 40:46.577
I'm supposed to be leaving for
college, not dealing with you guys.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.178
Just have dinner with me.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.814
Are you kidding?
No.

40:51.415 --> 40:54.151
Okay. All righty.

40:54.152 --> 40:57.888
Now, ladies and gentlemen, can we
have a little attention please?

40:57.889 --> 40:59.756
Can we have your attention?

40:59.757 --> 41:03.593
Uh, we're about to commence
the cooking ritual,

41:03.594 --> 41:07.430
as they used to say in the
international workers of the world,

41:07.431 --> 41:11.267
by any means necessary.

41:11.268 --> 41:15.238
And so I think we need a sacrifice.

41:15.239 --> 41:17.277
So is there a virgin here?

41:20.677 --> 41:21.879
Oh, my God.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.347
You know, there are some people

41:23.348 --> 41:26.483
who are virgins who don't want
to be perceived as virgins,

41:26.484 --> 41:29.486
and there are some people who...

41:29.487 --> 41:31.287
Time to cook the hamburgers.

41:31.288 --> 41:33.758
Time to cook the hamburgers.
Yes. Yes. Okay.

41:33.759 --> 41:36.792
You actually like him, don't you?
We should just swap families.

41:36.793 --> 41:39.263
Any time.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.897
No one laughs at my house.

41:40.898 --> 41:45.769
No one shuts up here.

41:45.770 --> 41:48.372
I talked to David yesterday.

41:48.373 --> 41:49.472
You did?

41:49.473 --> 41:51.307
I mean, if you can call it that.

41:51.308 --> 41:53.544
He's not much of a talker.

41:53.545 --> 41:55.412
He called you?

41:55.413 --> 41:58.381
No, I called him to
invite him to this,

41:58.382 --> 42:02.218
but he said he couldn't come.

42:02.219 --> 42:04.588
You think I shouldn't have called?

42:04.589 --> 42:07.299
I don't know.

42:56.340 --> 42:57.541
What are you doing?

42:57.542 --> 43:01.278
This is my room.

43:01.279 --> 43:02.979
Excuse me.

43:02.980 --> 43:06.816
The last time I checked, I still
paid the mortgage on this house.

43:06.817 --> 43:08.484
So I don't get any privacy?

43:08.485 --> 43:10.988
Your sisters are already up and out.

43:10.989 --> 43:14.992
- Let's get going.
- Thank God for small things.

43:14.993 --> 43:19.796
I sure hope the inside of your
head doesn't look like this room.

43:19.797 --> 43:22.640
Can you just leave that?

43:29.040 --> 43:31.609
Come on.
Get going.

43:40.918 --> 43:44.720
- Lilly.
- I'm in the shower!

43:44.721 --> 43:46.356
Do you have my cream rinse in there?

43:46.357 --> 43:47.890
- No!
- Are you sure?

43:47.891 --> 43:51.294
I can't find it.

43:51.295 --> 43:52.928
Yeah, it's not in here.

43:52.929 --> 43:55.432
Your father called.

43:55.433 --> 43:58.434
He wants you to let him know if
you're going to have dinner with him.

43:58.435 --> 44:00.370
Okay!

44:00.371 --> 44:02.673
I'm going downstairs.
I have a patient.

44:02.674 --> 44:05.645
We have 15 minutes.

44:21.525 --> 44:24.593
<i>I'm lost in the light</i>

44:24.594 --> 44:27.232
<i>I pray for the night</i>

44:27.632 --> 44:33.836
<i>Take me to take you too</i>

44:33.837 --> 44:36.772
<i>After so many words</i>

44:36.773 --> 44:40.042
<i>Still nothing's heard</i>

44:40.043 --> 44:45.448
<i>Don't know what we should do</i>

44:45.449 --> 44:47.917
<i>So someone could see me now</i>

44:47.918 --> 44:51.326
<i>Let them see you</i>

44:55.726 --> 44:58.961
<i>Was my greatest thrill</i>

44:58.962 --> 45:02.099
<i>When we just stood still</i>

45:02.100 --> 45:08.405
<i>Let me hold your hand
till I had my fill</i>

45:08.406 --> 45:11.475
<i>Even countin' sheep</i>

45:11.476 --> 45:14.544
<i>Don't help me sleep</i>

45:14.545 --> 45:19.950
<i>I just toss and turn
right there beside you</i>

45:19.951 --> 45:22.551
<i>So if someone could help me now</i>

45:22.552 --> 45:27.089
<i>- They'd help you too</i>
- How'd you find this?

45:27.090 --> 45:28.825
My cousins used to live here.

45:28.826 --> 45:31.894
<i>They'd help you too</i>

45:31.895 --> 45:35.531
<i>See you through</i>

45:35.532 --> 45:38.135
<i>All the hard things</i>

45:38.136 --> 45:41.437
<i>We've all got to do</i>

45:41.438 --> 45:44.474
<i>'Cause this life is long</i>

45:44.475 --> 45:47.977
<i>And so you wouldn't be wrong</i>

45:47.978 --> 45:50.881
<i>Bein' free with me</i>

45:50.882 --> 45:56.578
<i>On my own</i>

46:40.130 --> 46:43.667
<i>And I held my own</i>

46:43.668 --> 46:46.535
<i>Still I rattled your bones</i>

46:46.536 --> 46:52.876
<i>I said some awful things
and I take them back</i>

46:52.877 --> 46:56.146
<i>If we would try again</i>

46:56.147 --> 46:59.649
<i>Just remember when</i>

46:59.650 --> 47:01.584
<i>Before we were lovers</i>

47:01.585 --> 47:04.221
<i>I swear we were friends</i>

47:04.621 --> 47:07.156
<i>So if someone could see me now</i>

47:07.157 --> 47:13.830
<i>Let them see you</i>

47:13.831 --> 47:16.932
<i>Let them see you</i>

47:16.933 --> 47:20.269
<i>See you through</i>

47:20.270 --> 47:23.073
<i>All the hard things</i>

47:23.074 --> 47:26.242
<i>We've all got to do</i>

47:26.243 --> 47:29.546
<i>'Cause this life is long</i>

47:29.547 --> 47:33.249
<i>So you wouldn't be wrong</i>

47:33.250 --> 47:36.086
<i>Bein' free with me</i>

47:36.087 --> 47:41.604
<i>On my own</i>

47:53.004 --> 47:55.643
Really like that one.

47:59.043 --> 48:00.709
That one?

48:00.710 --> 48:04.280
That one's my mom.

48:04.281 --> 48:08.051
Sometimes I wish she would just die.

48:08.052 --> 48:11.158
Your mom?
Why?

48:13.558 --> 48:16.899
She makes you very miserable.

48:21.299 --> 48:24.672
I'm afraid of dying.

48:35.446 --> 48:39.718
I'm afraid of not doing
anything while I'm still here.

48:42.118 --> 48:45.205
I don't think there's
much chance of that.

49:10.781 --> 49:13.491
What time is it?

49:21.891 --> 49:24.761
9:30.

49:27.831 --> 49:31.571
I told my mom I'd call
if I wasn't back my ten.

49:34.971 --> 49:37.643
Where's your phone?

49:39.043 --> 49:41.879
Aw, come on, don't go.

49:43.279 --> 49:45.814
It's in the kitchen.

49:45.815 --> 49:48.618
Well, mine's dead.

49:54.792 --> 49:56.693
- Mom?
<i>- Oh, thank God.</i>

49:56.694 --> 49:58.093
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- At a friend's.

49:58.094 --> 50:00.468
<i>Gerry's been trying to find you.</i>

50:03.868 --> 50:06.368
<i>Subway...</i>

50:06.369 --> 50:09.875
<i>Emergency. Her father died...</i>

50:11.275 --> 50:13.109
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

50:13.110 --> 50:15.384
Right now.

50:20.784 --> 50:23.689
What is it?

50:26.089 --> 50:28.158
- Hey...
- Don't.

50:28.159 --> 50:30.459
I have to go.

50:30.460 --> 50:33.430
What...
what's goin' on?

50:33.431 --> 50:35.765
- Gerry's father died.
- Whoa, whoa. Let me go...

50:35.766 --> 50:38.734
No.

51:44.134 --> 51:47.071
I'm so sorry.

51:48.471 --> 51:51.508
I'm so sorry.

51:53.810 --> 51:56.845
I don't feel anything.

51:56.846 --> 51:58.414
You know, I know that...

51:58.415 --> 52:02.760
that my life has changed forever,
and all I want to do is go to sleep.

52:04.695 --> 52:09.859
Because I'm the same, but I'll
never be the same, you know?

52:09.860 --> 52:13.832
Like he'll never slap
me on the butt again.

52:15.092 --> 52:18.468
He'll never see me
graduate, and he won't...

52:18.469 --> 52:19.868
see me get married,

52:19.869 --> 52:23.105
and he'll never know my kids.

52:29.846 --> 52:33.832
I want my daddy.

52:49.232 --> 52:51.200
How is she?

52:51.201 --> 52:54.269
Okay.

52:54.270 --> 52:55.905
How are you?

52:55.906 --> 52:58.810
I'm fine.

53:00.210 --> 53:03.446
You can't let this happen, mom.

53:03.447 --> 53:06.232
You've got to let him come back.

53:21.632 --> 53:24.367
I was very sorry to hear
about Gerry's father.

53:24.368 --> 53:26.203
Yeah.

53:26.603 --> 53:29.338
I'll go to the funeral
with you, if you like.

53:29.339 --> 53:31.571
There isn't gonna be a funeral.

53:31.609 --> 53:34.109
Just a memorial service.

53:34.110 --> 53:36.579
Then they'll scatter his ashes.

53:36.580 --> 53:39.147
That's how they do it.

53:39.148 --> 53:40.950
Did mom talk to you
about coming back?

53:40.951 --> 53:43.553
Yeah.

53:43.554 --> 53:45.354
Are you?

53:45.355 --> 53:47.890
I don't know.

53:47.891 --> 53:52.196
You could just die, and
none of this would matter.

53:52.596 --> 53:54.296
Just talk to her.
Explain it.

53:54.297 --> 53:56.932
- Say you're sorry.
- I have.

53:56.933 --> 53:58.401
She won't let you.

53:58.402 --> 54:01.370
Try and understand it from her side.

54:01.371 --> 54:03.472
- Is that what you're doing?
- Yeah.

54:03.473 --> 54:06.341
That's exactly what I'm doing.

54:06.342 --> 54:09.312
Now...

54:09.313 --> 54:11.414
I love you, but I gotta go.

54:11.415 --> 54:13.922
Okay?

54:30.701 --> 54:35.071
God, I can't go back in there and
look at all that food again.

54:35.072 --> 54:39.279
It's like we're having a
party, and he's just late.

54:41.679 --> 54:43.379
God, I gotta get out of here.

54:43.380 --> 54:47.350
I want to go to work,
but Kate won't let me.

54:47.351 --> 54:49.218
You should take a few days.

54:49.219 --> 54:51.321
It's really weird.

54:51.322 --> 54:54.589
All I can think about is David.

54:54.590 --> 54:59.272
I keep imagining that he's
gonna walk through the door.

55:11.342 --> 55:13.709
Hello?

55:13.710 --> 55:17.479
Oh, David?
Yes, hold on a second.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.082
It's for you.

55:19.083 --> 55:22.156
David Applebee or something.

55:25.556 --> 55:27.522
Tell him I'm not here.

55:27.523 --> 55:29.191
Why?
You are here.

55:29.192 --> 55:32.930
Just tell him.

55:33.330 --> 55:36.134
You're weird.

55:37.534 --> 55:39.001
She's actually not here.

55:39.002 --> 55:42.738
Can I take a message?

55:42.739 --> 55:45.690
Okay.

56:01.090 --> 56:03.292
Did you get my message?

56:03.293 --> 56:06.062
- No.
- I talked to your sister.

56:06.063 --> 56:08.463
- She didn't tell me.
- She said she'd write it down.

56:08.464 --> 56:10.600
I've been trying to get ahold of
you for, like, three days now.

56:10.601 --> 56:13.068
- I was with Gerry.
- How is she?

56:13.069 --> 56:14.771
Okay.

56:14.772 --> 56:16.772
I have a trip in 15 minutes.

56:16.773 --> 56:18.274
All right.
I'll come back after work.

56:18.275 --> 56:20.176
No, I'm gonna see Gerry after work.

56:20.177 --> 56:21.510
Okay.
I'll come with you.

56:21.511 --> 56:23.312
No.

56:23.313 --> 56:25.481
You should go this afternoon
if you're not working.

56:25.482 --> 56:29.218
There's a lot of people at night.

56:29.219 --> 56:32.789
So, is that what you want?
For me to see her alone?

56:32.790 --> 56:35.323
Yeah.

56:35.324 --> 56:39.060
All right. I'll let you
know how that goes.

57:09.460 --> 57:12.461
Hey.

57:12.462 --> 57:14.326
Sorry about your father.

57:18.435 --> 57:22.305
Well, thank...
thanks for... for coming.

57:22.306 --> 57:25.173
Do you want anything to eat or...

57:25.174 --> 57:27.886
No, I'm f... fine.

57:36.286 --> 57:37.753
Wanna get out of here?

57:37.754 --> 57:40.395
Yeah. Yeah.

57:45.795 --> 57:48.966
Everything tastes...
sort of smells in here.

57:50.366 --> 57:53.535
It's for the blind.

57:53.536 --> 57:56.171
He used to take me
when I was a kid.

57:56.172 --> 57:58.477
I mean, my...
my dad.

58:00.877 --> 58:04.780
He was always so quiet.

58:04.781 --> 58:07.649
It's like now.

58:07.650 --> 58:11.855
Even he was quiet here.

58:16.927 --> 58:19.928
Once I came by myself on my bike.

58:19.929 --> 58:23.298
And it started to rain.
I was like, uh...

58:23.299 --> 58:25.700
Seven-years-old,

58:25.701 --> 58:28.905
terrified, soaking wet.

58:28.906 --> 58:32.475
And I, um...

58:32.476 --> 58:36.013
I looked up and he was there.

58:37.013 --> 58:39.414
I didn't tell anyone where
I was going, you know?

58:39.415 --> 58:43.187
He just...

58:43.587 --> 58:47.589
He knew.

58:47.590 --> 58:49.926
I'm sorry.
Could you please hold me?

58:49.927 --> 58:52.806
Could you hold me?

59:03.206 --> 59:07.149
That was dad.

59:13.549 --> 59:16.818
Would you make love to me?

59:16.819 --> 59:18.787
And I'm asking you...

59:18.788 --> 59:20.756
You don't need to feel
responsible or anything.

59:20.757 --> 59:23.158
You know, I just, um...

59:25.596 --> 59:29.397
I just feel like you understand.

59:29.398 --> 59:32.239
Please.

59:35.639 --> 59:38.218
Please.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.535
All right, folks.
We all know Danny was

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:09.939
a man of, for the people.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.707
He was also a sexy son of a bitch.

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:14.210
I can't listen to this.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:17.680
And he loved his Kate.

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:21.684
Anybody who spent five minutes
with him could see that.

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:25.021
He came over yesterday.

01:00:25.022 --> 01:00:27.627
David?

01:00:30.027 --> 01:00:33.196
I did it, Lilly.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:40.001
Okay, so you're thinking
about my father...

01:00:40.002 --> 01:00:42.705
that this is crazy.

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:44.673
But it...

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:46.776
It just felt right.

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:48.977
You know, I needed to do it.

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:55.318
I understand.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:58.053
You know, underneath all that tough
guy stuff, he's really... he's...

01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:01.756
he's so gentle and...

01:01:01.757 --> 01:01:04.327
I'm glad it was him.
So...

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.827
I don't feel any
different, you know?

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:08.997
I mean, I... I'm not sore.
I didn't bleed.

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.800
My mom always said I, uh...

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:14.805
I lost it to a swing
when I was four. So...

01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:19.841
Don't worry. I'm okay.

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:22.678
<i>If</i>

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:26.414
<i>you want</i>

01:01:26.415 --> 01:01:31.959
<i>to fly</i>

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:38.562
I love you.

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:42.738
Love you.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:54.410
<i>Just let go</i>

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:59.587
<i>of your mind</i>

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:07.423
Can I have the brown?

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:09.492
Jackie's sleeping over.

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:11.760
Who said you could use that?

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.396
It's just an eraser.

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:15.197
It was on your dresser.
What's the big deal?

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:18.436
Stay out of my room and
away from my things!

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:31.352
<i>Don't be sad</i>

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:40.357
<i>Be glad</i>

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:47.799
<i>You'll find your way</i>

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:54.370
<i>You'll find your way</i>

01:02:57.808 --> 01:03:01.209
<i>And when</i>

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:05.146
<i>You reach</i>

01:03:05.147 --> 01:03:10.118
<i>Your love</i>

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:13.823
David. Too busy to answer my phone.

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:18.593
<i>Or just relax</i>

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:25.205
<i>And drift away</i>

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:34.814
<i>And if you find</i>

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:39.080
Hey.

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:42.484
I'll take that drink.

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.125
Um...

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:53.198
you want, like, a... a drink?

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:57.867
Oh, shit. I haven't got any ice.

01:03:57.868 --> 01:04:00.444
- It's fine.
- Okay.

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:12.352
Okay.

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:19.892
Ooh, I need a haircut.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.656
Oh.

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:56.826
Oh, boy.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:23.818
Okay.

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:26.689
I really like you.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:30.158
You're smart.

01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:31.794
I wanna give you a
chance to walk away.

01:05:31.795 --> 01:05:33.662
I don't want to hurt you.

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:36.234
I'm a big girl.

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:41.205
All right.
Let's have some fun.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:44.272
Come on.
Come on.

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:19.274
Hey, you on the pill?

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:21.075
- You on the pill?
- No.

01:06:21.076 --> 01:06:22.678
- No?
- No.

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:26.247
Okay.

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:28.050
Stay right here.
I gotta get some protection.

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:30.488
Okay?

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.205
Hey!

01:06:51.206 --> 01:06:54.709
Hey!
Where you goin'?

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.330
Where you goin'?

01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:25.685
Come in.

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:37.118
You okay?

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:39.488
Why'd you do it?

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:41.823
Do what?

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:44.895
Gerry.

01:07:46.269 --> 01:07:48.796
Don't tell me what happened
didn't mean anything.

01:07:48.797 --> 01:07:51.166
Yeah, it meant something.

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:52.867
You asked me to go see her.

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:55.137
I didn't ask you to sleep with her.

01:07:55.138 --> 01:07:56.905
No. She did.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.908
So you did.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.209
Is that what you think happened?

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:04.585
I don't have to think it happened.
She told me it did.

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:11.357
She said that?

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:16.447
I just fucked Fizsimmons.

01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:40.448
Dad's back. He brought
his clothes and stuff.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.818
He got you that?

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:44.484
- You had one.
- We did not.

01:08:44.486 --> 01:08:46.287
Dad said they were too dangerous.

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:49.997
Apparently, guilt will
corrupt people's principles.

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:58.499
You're cooking?

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.234
Hi.

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:01.904
That's it? Hi?

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.636
You're just back?
No one talks about it?

01:09:03.638 --> 01:09:07.073
You haven't given us a chance
to say anything yet, Lilly.

01:09:07.075 --> 01:09:09.310
Here's your chance.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:12.145
Your father and I decided
that it would be better

01:09:12.147 --> 01:09:14.881
for everybody if he...
if he came back home.

01:09:14.883 --> 01:09:16.517
Why?

01:09:16.518 --> 01:09:18.153
What are we? The wallpaper?

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.888
We're just supposed to sit back and
watch while you move in and move out

01:09:20.889 --> 01:09:23.323
and move in and move out again
like it makes no difference to us?

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:26.493
- This is what you wanted.
- I don't understand what's different

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.328
I've been asking you to
come back for weeks.

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.868
And now, suddenly, you just do it.

01:09:33.268 --> 01:09:37.840
This time, I asked him.

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.216
Are you crazy?

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.956
Do you want him to leave again?

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:55.591
What am I gonna do when you leave?

01:09:55.592 --> 01:09:59.064
- Transfer.
- Yeah, right.

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:05.903
Well, these could be cute, right?

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:09.572
Mmm.

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:12.440
You didn't buy anything.

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:16.714
Saving all your money for
those designer drugs?

01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:21.346
And I can't believe you're
gonna be in fucking old haven.

01:10:21.347 --> 01:10:23.084
Like, what are you gonna do there?

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:26.788
It's so boring.

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:34.462
Do you think I should call him?

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:36.364
No.

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.367
No, I don't think you
should call him.

01:10:38.368 --> 01:10:40.468
I'm so tired of hearing about him.

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:42.069
You're making a fool of yourself.

01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:43.971
Leave the guy alone.

01:10:43.972 --> 01:10:47.208
If he wants to see
you, he'll call you.

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:49.977
Okay.

01:10:49.978 --> 01:10:51.512
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go home.

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:54.970
Great.
No one's stopping you.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.506
Lilly!
I gotta talk to you.

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:19.341
Lil!

01:11:19.342 --> 01:11:22.543
Lil, would you talk to me?
What the fuck?

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:24.578
Lil!

01:11:24.579 --> 01:11:27.553
Lilly!

01:11:29.553 --> 01:11:31.319
You gotta straighten this out, Lil.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.187
- Me?
- I didn't sleep with her!

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:35.190
- She told me!
- You fucking better ask her again.

01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:37.092
I don't have to.
She's not a liar, David.

01:11:37.093 --> 01:11:39.160
- I want you to tell Gerry.
- Tell Gerry what?

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:41.462
- How this all started!
- I don't know how it started.

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:43.597
I wasn't there.

01:11:43.598 --> 01:11:45.600
- I thought you cared about her.
- I do.

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:48.736
Then tell her why I came to the house
that day. Tell her how it happened!

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:51.281
We already know what happened.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:15.364
I didn't call him.

01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:18.533
He called me.

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:21.403
We're hanging out on Sunday.

01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:22.738
What for?

01:12:22.739 --> 01:12:25.239
What do you mean, "what for?"

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:29.110
He wants to take a walk in the
gardens, where we went before.

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:31.379
Okay.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:35.321
Well, thanks for making
me act like a person.

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:42.796
I like yours better.

01:13:22.764 --> 01:13:24.231
Go away.

01:13:24.232 --> 01:13:27.777
It's me.

01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:36.917
He's leaving.

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:43.618
Where's he going?

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.287
Paris.

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:48.489
Tomorrow at four.

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:52.394
That's it?
That's all he said?

01:13:52.395 --> 01:13:54.234
Isn't that enough?

01:13:59.634 --> 01:14:02.205
I think I should go say good-bye.

01:14:10.713 --> 01:14:13.286
David?

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:18.552
Why didn't you tell me?

01:14:18.553 --> 01:14:22.224
You're really somethin' else.

01:14:22.225 --> 01:14:23.824
- Why now?
- I'm gonna go do my work.

01:14:23.825 --> 01:14:26.428
I can't deal with this anymore.

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:29.431
I really want you to stay.

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:32.234
- Then tell Gerry the truth.
- I can't!

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:35.369
Do you know how hurt she would be?
What kind of friend would I be then?

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:38.640
I don't know. What kind
of friend are you now?

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:41.314
I didn't sleep with Fitzsimmons.

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:49.120
I'm trying to tell you the truth.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:53.288
You hurt me.

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:55.858
So you had to hurt me back, right?

01:14:56.859 --> 01:14:59.997
You know, you really
are fully of shit.

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:03.797
You keep this up, and there
won't be anyone left

01:15:03.798 --> 01:15:06.209
to play with, you understand?

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:16.023
I gotta go.

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:03.225
What was that?

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:04.993
He just kissed you!

01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:06.860
I've been seeing him.

01:16:06.861 --> 01:16:09.663
Since when?

01:16:09.664 --> 01:16:11.833
All summer.

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:15.003
Until your dad died.

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:17.504
Wow.

01:16:17.505 --> 01:16:20.542
What happened when my dad died?

01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:24.245
I stopped seeing him.

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:26.987
He started seeing you.

01:16:31.387 --> 01:16:35.157
You told him to see me?

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:38.260
Yeah, but I didn't ask
him to sleep with you.

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:39.860
Oh, my God.

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.562
You're such a conceited bitch!

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:43.897
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:16:43.898 --> 01:16:45.367
Oh, my God!

01:16:45.368 --> 01:16:47.702
I just wanted to make
you feel better.

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.537
You liked him so much.

01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:51.373
So you decided to play God, right?

01:16:51.374 --> 01:16:53.408
To throw him at me like
some sort of booby prize?

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:56.477
Because my father dropped
dead on a subway?

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:59.881
God, you're sick!

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:01.783
I was just trying to
do something good!

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:05.287
Yeah, like, sure, you
actually believed that!

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:09.291
- I'm so sorry.
- So am I!

01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:11.968
I'm so sorry.

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:27.901
What are you doin' in here?

01:18:27.902 --> 01:18:30.176
Nothing.

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:38.086
I had sex with someone.

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:48.056
You tryin' to shock me?

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.395
I don't know.

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:58.833
You all right?

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:02.439
It was with someone
Gerry really liked.

01:19:04.839 --> 01:19:07.941
And she's upset?

01:19:07.942 --> 01:19:11.750
She'll never talk to me again.

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:16.083
Well...

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:19.221
People aren't perfect, kiddo.

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:22.891
They make mistakes.

01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:26.528
Sometimes, it's harder
to forgive yourself

01:19:26.529 --> 01:19:29.769
than to get somebody else to do it.

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:36.971
But...

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:39.380
People will surprise you.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:49.486
Well, thank you for tellin' me.

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:53.706
I didn't know I could.

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:20.911
I'm here to turn this in
and pick up my last check.

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:41.569
There you go.

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:44.571
I didn't expect to, uh...

01:20:44.572 --> 01:20:46.845
Give a shit.

01:20:49.245 --> 01:20:51.630
Get out of here.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:22.581
I guess I never really
thought this day would come.

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:28.353
It's your turn, babe.

01:21:30.753 --> 01:21:36.162
At least, I gave you some stellar
examples of how not to do it.

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:46.832
Okay. Let's go.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.567
I think this is for you.

01:23:24.967 --> 01:23:27.989
You were there, weren't
you, when he took that?

01:23:30.039 --> 01:23:33.408
Yes.

01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:36.310
I got it in the mail yesterday,
so I guess that was his...

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:39.350
his way of making sure
that you'd see it.

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:46.354
No.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:49.798
It was his way of making sure
that we'd see each other.

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:04.840
I'm so sorry, Ger.

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.941
What are you doin'?

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:10.177
You don't know how sorry I am.

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:13.382
Okay, I bet.
You...

01:24:14.782 --> 01:24:16.050
What are you doin'?

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.485
This guy was smiling.
Happy.

01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:20.221
You need to put your clothes on.

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:23.091
Because this is crazy.

01:24:23.092 --> 01:24:26.595
Yeah? You have to forgive me.

01:24:27.995 --> 01:24:30.933
I can't lose you.

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:34.504
Um, okay.
I, um...

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.771
I didn't do it.

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:39.106
I didn't do what?

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:41.309
I didn't sleep with him.

01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:44.278
Um...

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:45.747
I asked...
I begged...

01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:48.048
and uh, he kissed me on the head

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:53.556
and told me that he was in
love with someone else.

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:57.257
I'm really sorry.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:59.494
I'm... I'm never gonna
lie to you again,

01:24:59.495 --> 01:25:01.462
I... I swear.

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:04.367
I was just...
I was really confused.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.368
- Angry?
- Yeah.

01:25:07.369 --> 01:25:09.837
At Danny, you know, for just...

01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:12.107
fucking dying.

01:25:13.008 --> 01:25:14.775
Ooh. Love you.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.177
Me too.

01:25:16.178 --> 01:25:19.747
I'm gonna visit you
a lot, a lot, a lot!

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:23.450
- Uh-oh. Oh, my God!
- Uh-oh.

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:25.086
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, my God!

01:25:25.087 --> 01:25:27.288
What's goin' on here?

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:29.556
What's happening?

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:31.359
Lilly's naked.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.129
Shut up.

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.909
<i>If you want to find yourself</i>

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.278
<i>By travelin' out west</i>

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:27.315
<i>Or if you wanna find somebody else</i>

01:26:27.316 --> 01:26:32.121
<i>That's better go ahead</i>

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:36.594
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:26:38.994 --> 01:26:43.297
<i>If you wanna buy a brand
new fancy automobile</i>

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:45.900
<i>Or if you wanna build a place</i>

01:26:45.901 --> 01:26:48.101
<i>Up in cold water canyon</i>

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:50.575
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:26:52.975 --> 01:26:55.946
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:26:57.346 --> 01:26:59.913
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:02.149
<i>I wish you would</i>

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:05.022
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:12.059
<i>If you wanna have your
cake and eat it too</i>

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.628
<i>And if you wanna have other people</i>

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:16.564
<i>Watch you while you eat it</i>

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:21.369
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:24.773
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:27:26.173 --> 01:27:28.476
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:27:28.477 --> 01:27:31.011
<i>Be my guest</i>

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:35.018
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:41.489
<i>If you want</i>

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:46.427
<i>Better things</i>

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:55.170
<i>I want you to have them</i>

01:27:56.570 --> 01:28:01.007
<i>If you</i>

01:28:01.008 --> 01:28:06.413
<i>Want better things</i>

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:11.118
<i>Then I want you</i>

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:14.291
<i>To have them</i>

01:28:15.691 --> 01:28:20.394
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:25.399
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.202
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:30.337
<i>I wish you would</i>

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:33.710
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:37.244
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:40.347
<i>I wish you would</i>

01:28:40.348 --> 01:28:44.855
<i>Go ahead</i>

01:28:53.395 --> 01:28:55.296
<i>La la la la</i>

01:28:55.297 --> 01:28:59.201
<i>I fell asleep in my parents' room</i>

01:28:59.601 --> 01:29:03.270
<i>I awoke to the cable news</i>

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:07.377
<i>There was a fire at Brooklyn school</i>

01:29:09.777 --> 01:29:13.681
<i>I melted down like Fukushima</i>

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:15.416
<i>Don't you wanna know</i>

01:29:15.417 --> 01:29:17.551
<i>How I'm feelin'</i>

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:23.190
<i>I just want to talk to you</i>

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:26.560
<i>'Cause it burns</i>

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:31.464
<i>It still burns</i>

01:29:31.465 --> 01:29:33.667
<i>It burns</i>

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:38.739
<i>It still burns</i>

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.775
<i>It burns</i>

01:29:40.776 --> 01:29:43.715
<i>It still hurts</i>

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:49.083
<i>La la la la</i>

01:29:49.084 --> 01:29:54.320
<i>Ooh</i>

01:29:54.321 --> 01:29:56.589
<i>La la la la</i>

01:29:56.590 --> 01:29:59.293
<i>Hold up I'm comin'</i>

01:29:59.294 --> 01:30:03.797
<i>In the glow of the rising sun</i>

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:06.400
<i>I found my calling</i>

01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:08.569
<i>In the lows and the feeling</i>

01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:12.839
<i>Of when you're gone</i>

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.809
<i>It burns</i>

01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:19.779
<i>It still burns</i>

01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:22.083
<i>It burns</i>

01:30:22.084 --> 01:30:27.421
<i>It still burns</i>

01:30:27.422 --> 01:30:29.256
<i>It burns</i>

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:32.996
<i>It still hurts</i>

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:39.071
<i>La la la la</i>

01:30:42.471 --> 01:30:44.437
<i>La la la la</i>
