WEBVTT

00:13.389 --> 00:15.933
A suspect in custody

00:15.975 --> 00:18.519
but no charges filed.

00:18.561 --> 00:21.063
What are they waiting for?

00:21.105 --> 00:23.858
What are they hiding?

00:23.899 --> 00:25.651
A cop--

00:25.693 --> 00:27.653
Francis Sheehan--

00:27.695 --> 00:31.031
who murdered Howard Elias
to silence him.

00:31.073 --> 00:33.033
-Girl...
-Silence is their weapon.

00:33.075 --> 00:35.161
The blue curtain falls.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.871
But you know what?

00:36.912 --> 00:38.831
We will not be silenced.

00:38.873 --> 00:42.376
Come Sunday, our voices
will break through their silence

00:42.418 --> 00:44.044
with our weapons--

00:44.086 --> 00:45.963
the weapons of truth,

00:46.005 --> 00:49.633
transparency,
accountability and justice.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.761
We will march
to Hollywood Station

00:51.802 --> 00:54.805
and we will speak--
of justice for Howard Elias,

00:54.847 --> 00:57.558
of justice for Michael Harris,
of justice for L.A.,

00:57.600 --> 01:00.603
and for Justice Now,
motherfuckers.

01:02.188 --> 01:05.149
2,700 unique views.

01:05.191 --> 01:07.193
- -Viral.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.070
-That's crazy.
-Oh, my God.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.827
-Oh, get out, man.
-I'm telling you.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.790
-Hey, you okay to drive

01:20.831 --> 01:23.584
I'm just on Stanley--
you got to go over the hill.

01:23.626 --> 01:26.962
-Ah, I might take a power nap
in the car. -All right.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.485
Hey!

01:49.527 --> 01:51.487
I'm just helping my friend.

01:51.529 --> 01:53.531
-Locked his keys inside.
-I'm a police officer.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.741
Step away from the vehicle.
Show me your hands.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.451
Wait, wha-wha...

01:57.493 --> 01:59.662
-Show me your hands.
-Aw, come on.

02:07.837 --> 02:09.171
-I need some identification.
-Okay, okay.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.172
I'm just... Don't shoot me.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.507
Let me get it out. Here.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.008
Hey, yo.
Bartender had the real thing.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.343
What the fuck is going on?

02:14.385 --> 02:16.428
-He's a cop.
-Hey, drop that.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.305
-Drop it!
-Officer Uncle Tom.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.516
-I'm getting it, all right?
It's right here. -Yo, yo, yo.

02:20.558 --> 02:21.684
I-It's my car, man, all right?

02:21.725 --> 02:22.810
He doesn't have
to show you anything.

02:22.852 --> 02:23.978
You don't have probable cause.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.104
Drew, it's cool.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.022
Nah, it's not cool.
They got time

02:27.064 --> 02:29.191
-Police! -for this bullshit but
not to charge the killer cop?

02:29.233 --> 02:30.943
-Step back. -Put your hands
on the fence now.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.361
Okay, well, we-we don't have
to show you shit.

02:32.403 --> 02:33.445
I need three I.D.s now.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.114
We haven't done anything wrong.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.198
Come on. Let's go.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.992
Dude, you cops
are out of control!

02:38.033 --> 02:39.034
On the fence.
Hands behind your head.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.202
Hands on the fence now.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.872
Hollywood units and 6-A-45.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.874
Requesting a backup
at Cherokee and Hollywood.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.834
-6-A-45 handle code three.
-

02:46.876 --> 02:50.129
6-L-60. Show me responding
to the backup.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.768
LaForest. What do we got here?

03:04.810 --> 03:07.313
Rolled up on a possible BFMV.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.398
Seriously?

03:23.037 --> 03:25.039
Some of Mom's friends

03:25.080 --> 03:26.999
want to have a wake in Vegas.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.293
You tell them
that's not what she wanted?

03:30.336 --> 03:32.296
I'm not sure they care.

03:32.338 --> 03:34.214
I mean, what's she gonna do?

03:37.760 --> 03:41.096
Still headed over to Mom's

03:41.138 --> 03:42.765
this afternoon?

03:44.141 --> 03:46.435
You know there's no rush
for that, Mads.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.228
I know.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.358
So I guess your
Angel's Flight case is over.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.943
Almost.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.903
That sounded like a no.

03:55.945 --> 03:58.322
Something I missed.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.240
I don't know.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.034
You aren't sure the cop did it?

04:02.076 --> 04:04.370
Evidence says he did.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.080
Dad.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.333
What I can't figure
is what I got so wrong.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.751
I need you

04:10.793 --> 04:12.127
to close this today.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.837
Buy me some room to maneuver.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.673
Bringing one of our own
to justice--

04:15.714 --> 04:17.341
why would that need any spin?

04:17.383 --> 04:20.678
I said maneuver, not spin.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.723
Irv...

04:24.765 --> 04:27.059
we have a real opportunity here.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.728
The public thinks the motive

04:29.770 --> 04:31.939
-was Black Guardian.
-We can steal thunder

04:31.981 --> 04:33.941
from these
potentially violent protestors

04:33.983 --> 04:36.318
on Sunday
by letting the community know

04:36.360 --> 04:39.279
that they'll have a voice,
a real voice.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.492
Cops versus community.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.995
The mentality
I've been working to change.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.622
And you will. You're not
on the hook for any of this.

04:48.664 --> 04:51.083
Black Guardian was
on Chief Tenzer's watch.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.543
We isolate

04:52.584 --> 04:54.211
Francis Sheehan
as one bad apple--

04:54.253 --> 04:56.338
not representative
of the rank and file.

04:56.380 --> 04:59.008
You do know the saying
about bad apples?

05:00.592 --> 05:03.220
We shouldn't rush
to any so-called solutions

05:03.262 --> 05:05.264
without a clearer view
of the endgame.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.142
Just thinking out loud, Irv.

05:08.183 --> 05:12.021
We won't make any decisions
without your full approval.

05:13.022 --> 05:15.315
I appreciate that.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.192
Keep us informed.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.127
Chief?

05:35.169 --> 05:37.337
Ida, see if Millie Elias
has any free time

05:37.379 --> 05:38.964
this morning for me to visit.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.592
Then put in a call
to Laura Cooke at the Times.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.635
And get Detective Bosch in here.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.179
Now.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.423
- -

06:21.465 --> 06:22.633
- -

06:26.887 --> 06:28.180
- -

06:50.577 --> 06:53.914
I'm told your work with Francis
Sheehan yesterday was exemplary.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.543
Under difficult circumstances.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.586
Team effort.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.589
Still.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.553
How's your daughter?

07:09.388 --> 07:12.182
She's navigating.
Thanks for asking.

07:12.224 --> 07:15.102
Will you be filing
on Sheehan today?

07:15.144 --> 07:17.521
Depends how quickly
it comes together.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.148
Well, the mayor would like
to close this

07:19.189 --> 07:20.732
-as soon as possible.
-Yeah, well, the mayor

07:20.774 --> 07:23.610
doesn't have
to make it stick at trial.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.612
Something specific
I'm unaware of

07:25.654 --> 07:27.447
that might hold things up?

07:29.158 --> 07:31.118
Frank Sheehan admitted to me

07:31.160 --> 07:33.662
he was guilty
of the Black Guardian assault.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.874
So I'll have to coordinate

07:36.915 --> 07:39.751
with Internal Affairs
if we're filing additional.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.920
Admitted Black Guardian?

07:41.962 --> 07:44.339
But denies Elias?

07:44.381 --> 07:45.799
You believe him?

07:45.841 --> 07:47.676
I did.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.598
Who else knows about this?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.183
Just my team.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.693
Take the whole 48 hours.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.904
But I want to look
at the filing package

08:06.945 --> 08:09.823
-before you submit it
to the D.A. -Yes, sir.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.074
What do we want?
-CROWD: Justice!

08:11.116 --> 08:12.284
-When do we want it?
-Now!

08:12.326 --> 08:13.785
-What do we want?
-Justice!

08:13.827 --> 08:15.204
-When do we want it?
-Now!

08:15.245 --> 08:16.538
-What do we want?
-Justice!

08:16.580 --> 08:17.956
-When do we want it?
-Now!

08:17.998 --> 08:19.374
-What do we want?
-Justice!

08:19.416 --> 08:20.792
-When do we want it?
-Now!

08:20.834 --> 08:22.377
-What do we want?
-Justice!

08:22.419 --> 08:23.629
-When do we want it?
-Now!

08:23.670 --> 08:25.005
-What do we want?
-Justice!

08:25.047 --> 08:26.465
-When do we want it?
-Now!

08:26.506 --> 08:28.592
No justice, no peace.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.469
No justice, no peace.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.846
No justice, no peace.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.848
No justice, no peace.

08:34.890 --> 08:39.269
No justice, no peace.
No justice, no peace.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.440
-Hey, old-timer.
-Hey.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.652
He's, uh, asking for you.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.153
Tell his lawyer?

08:48.195 --> 08:51.073
Private moment, I believe.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.328
I'm trying to get in touch
with one of your dealers.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.788
Tiffany Hsu.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.082
Yeah, I've left
her messages, but...

09:01.583 --> 09:03.377
How long has that been?

09:03.418 --> 09:05.087
Me, too. If you hear from her,

09:05.128 --> 09:07.506
can you please ask her
to give me a call?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.508
Thank you.

09:09.549 --> 09:13.053
Thought I'd get an early start.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.932
On Elias?

09:16.974 --> 09:18.642
Or something else?

09:18.684 --> 09:20.143
What would that be?

09:26.817 --> 09:29.194
If you and Bosch need
any help with...

09:29.236 --> 09:31.196
-what you're not doing...
-Yeah.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.739
I appreciate it, Jimmy.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.397
Frank.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.732
You fucked me.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.108
No, you fucked yourself.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.360
-You lied to me.
-After all your bullshit

10:10.402 --> 10:13.822
about believing me and
proving me fucking innocent...

10:13.864 --> 10:16.241
Nothing I can do
about ballistics.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.576
Aw, shit no.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.287
Yeah, that's a perfect frame.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.581
Yeah, whose idea was that?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.624
You still saying
you didn't shoot Elias?

10:24.666 --> 10:26.418
Yeah, and my gun didn't either

10:26.460 --> 10:29.087
because I had it with me
and I wasn't fuckin' there.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.590
-You're a blackout drunk.
-Fuck off, Harry!

10:31.631 --> 10:32.966
-How would you even know?
-Fuck you!

10:33.008 --> 10:35.010
-Explain the match.
-I...

10:36.762 --> 10:38.096
I can't.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.557
I can't.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.310
Time was that
would've been your job.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.896
Hmm? Yeah.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.857
What happened to you?

11:19.721 --> 11:23.350
Charter member of the Oxford
Avenue garden cooperative.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.060
Got to be a blemish.
Parking ticket at least.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.562
Not so much
as an overdue library book.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.315
What's going on with
that traffic K hit-and-run?

11:30.357 --> 11:33.068
-Victim appears to be a saint.
-Wait. Maybe not.

11:33.110 --> 11:36.154
That Colt 1903
is reported stolen.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.948
Hey, LT?

11:37.989 --> 11:40.534
LaForest awaits.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.870
-Okay, keep me informed.
-Yeah.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.039
Who in Prints owes us a favor?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.374
There were three of them
detained,

11:47.416 --> 11:48.583
so backgrounds took a while.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.127
It's all in the log entry.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.087
But Sergeant Mankiewicz
suggested I run it by you.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.923
What I wrote is what happened.

11:54.965 --> 11:58.051
Not so much what you say
but how you say it, Sergeant.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.720
Powers and Edgewood screwed up.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.139
They should be dinged.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.849
The question is by whom
and for how long.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.017
I don't understand.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.687
Well, we got lucky
the civilians dropped it.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.441
But this goes in, we're forced
to file a 128 face sheet.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.735
Hyped up as this city is,
evidence of more cop misbehavior

12:15.777 --> 12:17.320
is about the last thing we need.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.864
I could smell alcohol
on Officer Powers' breath

12:18.905 --> 12:20.115
from three feet away.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.242
Edgewood, the same.
There are rules.

12:22.284 --> 12:26.037
Well, rules say you should've
made them blow. Right?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.873
Rules are a guide.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.501
Okay. Then what?

12:31.543 --> 12:33.587
A notice to correct

12:33.628 --> 12:36.214
stops at my desk.
It never goes public.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.507
Trust me,

12:37.549 --> 12:40.218
they will feel my wrath.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.887
They will accept it,

12:41.928 --> 12:44.764
and just as important,
you will still be accepted.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.478
Clear?

12:49.519 --> 12:51.855
It's clear.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.523
I need a list
of all weapons registered

12:53.565 --> 12:54.691
on Francis Sheehan's gun card.

12:54.733 --> 12:55.692
Soon as you can.

12:55.734 --> 12:56.985
-Thanks.
-How's Sheehan?

12:57.027 --> 12:58.403
Thinks I set him up.

12:58.445 --> 13:02.032
That's rich. You're
the only one who believed him.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.075
You want wits listed
alphabetically or by timeline?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.327
-Both.
-Alphabetically.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.995
Type a separate timeline
version to clip in.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.247
Where you at, Snyder?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.791
We're short some photos
we requested for the book.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.335
Okay. Let's run through
what we know.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.545
Frank Sheehan shot Howard Elias.

13:15.587 --> 13:18.882
45, Elias gets a text.
Angel's Flight in ten.

13:18.924 --> 13:22.010
Sheehan. Burner phone, luring
the man up there to kill him.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.386
Facts, Jimmy, not assumptions.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.555
After that depo dust-up,
I'm Elias,

13:25.597 --> 13:27.265
no way I go meet Sheehan alone.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.351
Someone else sent
a text from a burner.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.062
Wait.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.647
-An accomplice?
-Talk about assumptions.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.440
Elias recognized

13:35.482 --> 13:36.858
the burner number,
or he wouldn't have gone.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.276
Clandestine relationship?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.153
Maybe they met up there before.

13:40.195 --> 13:42.072
People say
Elias had a source in PAB.

13:42.113 --> 13:46.409
56.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.997
Let me get this straight.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.999
So, we're saying
Sheehan was up there,

13:53.041 --> 13:55.794
drunk off his ass,
at Angel's Flight,

13:55.835 --> 13:57.879
waiting... unseen?

13:57.921 --> 14:00.048
Kills Lanny Johnson
with a single shot,

14:00.090 --> 14:03.343
Elias also,
when the car gets up top.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.845
Kill shot
and the one up the pipe--

14:05.887 --> 14:08.723
quick, precise, like a pro--

14:08.765 --> 14:10.475
and then disappears
like Bigfoot,

14:10.517 --> 14:11.977
without anyone seeing him.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.395
That's what we're saying.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.980
Car waiting?

14:15.021 --> 14:16.523
There goes
that accomplice again.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.067
We need to nail this down
for the D.A.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.152
He can file with what we've got.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.405
Ballistics, Black Guardian,
probable cause.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.198
Lawyers put this
on a slow boat,

14:25.240 --> 14:28.243
we'll have plenty of time
to connect the dots.

14:28.285 --> 14:29.995
Maybe I should take another stab
at finding the slug

14:30.036 --> 14:32.205
-that went through the Operator.
-Maybe.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.708
But first we get Wexler
this warrant

14:34.749 --> 14:38.253
-and go search Margaret
Sheehan's garage. -

14:38.295 --> 14:40.714
Special Master
for Detective Bosch.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.008
Task force room is off-limits,
Counselor.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.427
We need to protect the case.

14:45.468 --> 14:49.222
-Uh, captain's office is empty.
-That's where we'll go.

14:53.518 --> 14:57.397
-What's up with that?
-I solve murders, not mysteries.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.904
Elias was gonna show
a video in court.

15:04.946 --> 15:08.116
Requested a practice session to
make sure it worked when he did.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.534
Okay. Tech request.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.411
Made by Elias himself.

15:11.453 --> 15:14.331
Didn't want even his associate
to know what he had.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.790
Which was what?

15:15.832 --> 15:17.626
Something on a Micro SD card.

15:17.667 --> 15:22.672
I found an adaptor
in his briefcase, like this.

15:22.714 --> 15:26.217
-Counselor?
-Of course, no card in his.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.554
What was the video?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.851
Bosch, I heard
about your ex-wife. I'm...

15:34.893 --> 15:36.603
I'm so sorry.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.813
What was the video?

15:38.855 --> 15:40.857
I have no idea.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.693
But if I did,
if I even had an inkling,

15:43.735 --> 15:45.320
I couldn't show you
that e-mail,

15:45.362 --> 15:48.073
because it might be related
to protected evidence.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.076
No videos in Elias's discovery,
not one.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.286
Gee, I think you're right.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.498
Michael Harris says
he was Elias's whole case.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.583
Forcing-- I'm speculating here--

15:58.625 --> 16:00.710
the defense
to put Black Guardian cops

16:00.752 --> 16:02.253
on the stand to rebut.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.131
He said, they said.

16:05.173 --> 16:08.927
Elias locks down their testimony
on cross, then shows the video.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.304
Proves the torture,
blows them out of the water.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.932
Impeachment evidence.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.017
Discovery rules don't apply.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.602
Look at you.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.354
What I don't understand?

16:19.396 --> 16:21.773
City would have given Elias

16:21.815 --> 16:23.942
anything he wanted
to keep that video quiet.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.944
Jury would have given him
more than that.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.071
The whole world sees it.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.288
Is it Sheehan?

16:40.542 --> 16:42.043
Right.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.395
What they're saying
about the cop is true.

17:00.437 --> 17:03.273
Francis Sheehan.

17:03.314 --> 17:06.484
There is compelling evidence.

17:06.526 --> 17:10.196
Well, killing my husband
won't stop the civil suit.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.781
No, it won't.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.953
But that's not why you're here.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.916
You would have made
a formidable lawyer, Millie,

17:21.958 --> 17:24.919
the way you can read people.

17:24.961 --> 17:28.173
No, I don't love the law
the way Howard did.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.760
I don't enjoy the game.

17:31.801 --> 17:35.263
And yet, you sent your son
to Hollywood station

17:35.305 --> 17:38.099
looking like a poster
for police brutality.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.311
I let my anger
get the best of me.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.732
Well, I've come
hoping to persuade you

17:45.774 --> 17:48.318
not to let your anger inflame
an already volatile situation.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.282
Well, conflagration
can be cleansing.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.452
Well, give me a chance
to make some changes

17:57.494 --> 18:00.914
before consigning
the entire city to hellfire.

18:00.955 --> 18:04.793
Mayor Ramos wants to position
himself as the reformer.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.628
His blue ribbon panel.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.131
I told him no.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.967
If I go back to work,

18:13.009 --> 18:15.386
it won't be
as a professional widow.

18:17.388 --> 18:20.391
I said no to Bradley Walker,
as well.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.977
What did the commissioner want?

18:23.019 --> 18:26.064
To tell me that his foundation
is funding this beast,

18:26.105 --> 18:29.442
assure me
that it will have real teeth,

18:29.484 --> 18:32.904
power to change
the corrosive culture

18:32.946 --> 18:35.740
of your department.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.034
His words or yours?

18:46.125 --> 18:50.964
They're trying to throw you
under the bus, Irvin.

18:51.005 --> 18:54.342
And even in the fog of my grief,
that doesn't sit right.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.266
-This is a notice to correct.
-Only because Mank told

19:01.307 --> 19:03.726
Sergeant LaForest to run it by
me before he cut a face sheet.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.395
Nothing happened.

19:05.436 --> 19:06.938
Three civilians
up against a wall

19:06.980 --> 19:08.773
under threat of deadly force?

19:08.815 --> 19:12.026
By two officers seen
in a nearby bar?

19:12.068 --> 19:13.403
None of 'em beef'd us.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.779
The driver had
an outstanding warrant

19:14.821 --> 19:16.906
that you traded.
Lucky you.

19:16.948 --> 19:20.159
All right.

19:22.912 --> 19:27.458
Lieutenant, look, this...
is all on me, all right?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.794
I misread the situation.
Edge had it covered.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.504
Your point?

19:33.548 --> 19:36.759
He doesn't deserve an NTC.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.137
Not to mention
this is gonna put a dent

19:39.178 --> 19:41.514
in his plans to move up to Vice.

19:41.556 --> 19:44.559
Yeah, this is gonna cost him six
months before he can reapply.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.562
If he hadn't engaged
after a few beers,

19:47.604 --> 19:50.148
you wouldn't have had
a situation to misread.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.901
You're both
excellent street cops.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.445
This time, you both fucked up.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.578
Thanks for stepping on the 128.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.288
I'll let Edge know.

20:07.290 --> 20:10.960
Should have the burner phone
call logs here tomorrow.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.922
What did
the Special Master want?

20:13.963 --> 20:16.883
RHD ever figure out how
Michael Harris's prints ended up

20:16.925 --> 20:18.676
on the Kincaid girl's
school book?

20:18.718 --> 20:21.095
Three months
before the junkyard,

20:21.137 --> 20:23.222
Harris worked part-time
at a car wash.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.558
Kincaid's mother took
her minivan there to wash it.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.268
Book on the back seat.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.187
Harris had to move it to vacuum.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.605
No good deed goes unpunished.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.148
They collect the junkyard

20:32.190 --> 20:34.734
security videos,
or was it you guys?

20:34.776 --> 20:37.570
It was RHD as part of Kincaid,
but we reviewed it.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.155
Yeah. Hours and hours.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.866
Nothing corroborated
any of Harris's claims.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.660
Maybe a camera someone missed.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.954
I was up there twice.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.289
Why the sudden interest
in Black Guardian?

20:48.331 --> 20:51.417
You want to learn how I work?
This is it. Look.

20:51.459 --> 20:54.337
Look again.
Sometimes you tread water.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.551
I need some coffee.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.433
Detectives,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

21:07.475 --> 21:10.019
This is Liz Fleischer. These are
Detectives Johnson and Moore.

21:10.061 --> 21:12.730
-Pleasure.
-Ms. Fleischer believes

21:12.772 --> 21:15.316
-that her stolen phone is here.
-I don't believe it's here.

21:15.358 --> 21:18.069
And I will leave you
in their expert hands.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.821
It is here.

21:19.862 --> 21:22.532
My computer's Find My Phone app
says it's here.

21:22.573 --> 21:26.786
That means that you
still have juice, so,

21:26.828 --> 21:29.288
may I have your number, please?

21:37.505 --> 21:39.257
Ah.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.433
What was that all about?

21:48.474 --> 21:52.437
Money Chandler's convinced
that Elias had a video

21:52.478 --> 21:54.564
that blows up
RHD's Black Guardian story.

21:54.605 --> 21:57.191
No justice...
-It's got to be the torture.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.568
Camera they didn't find.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.486
Michael Harris said

22:00.528 --> 22:03.364
Elias believed him,
like he was there.

22:03.406 --> 22:06.075
No justice, no peace!
No justice,

22:06.117 --> 22:09.287
no peace!
No justice, no peace!

22:16.502 --> 22:19.505
-Good.
-Listen, you want to go 60-40

22:19.547 --> 22:21.674
on that stance.

22:21.716 --> 22:24.927
There you go!
-DRAKE: Knob to the ball.

22:24.969 --> 22:28.139
Both hands, both hands.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.224
Good, good.
Keep a level swing, man.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.351
Eye on the ball,
follow through.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.812
Follow through.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.691
Which one's your grandson?

22:38.733 --> 22:40.985
You got your man, Santi.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.820
What, you come to crow?

22:42.862 --> 22:45.239
Not me, man.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.450
I get why you did what you did.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.035
But you don't agree.

22:49.077 --> 22:52.163
Maybe we just agree to disagree.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.165
I never thought he did it.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.959
That's why I stopped by.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.879
New developments, ballistics.

22:59.921 --> 23:03.591
Maybe you might want to amend
your original statement.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.927
And why would I need to do that?

23:05.968 --> 23:08.513
In the event
you forgot something,

23:08.554 --> 23:10.848
or misremembered.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.643
I gave him some money.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.603
That's what brothers do.

23:15.645 --> 23:18.022
Only time?

23:20.233 --> 23:22.485
What about Friday night?

23:22.527 --> 23:24.070
You helped a brother then, too?

23:24.112 --> 23:26.531
My statement is straight,
Santiago,

23:26.572 --> 23:28.366
and my memory works fine.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.493
I remember
how many cops' careers

23:30.535 --> 23:33.371
got ruined because of
that son of a bitch, Elias,

23:33.412 --> 23:35.498
for his 30 pieces of silver.

23:35.540 --> 23:39.001
I remember how you kept
your own counsel at Rampart

23:39.043 --> 23:40.962
to protect me.

23:41.003 --> 23:44.966
I remember back
when you were a real cop.

23:45.007 --> 23:48.386
Well, me and Sheehan...
we still are.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.601
She's naive.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.895
A little girl playing
with matches.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.274
-Anarchists?
-Doesn't take many.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.276
Reading between the lines,
Twitter, Reddit--

24:03.317 --> 24:04.735
they've already co-opted
her cause.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.696
She just doesn't know it yet.

24:08.281 --> 24:11.284
Desiree Zealy
and her noble crusade?

24:11.325 --> 24:12.910
That's the sideshow.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.537
This could get ugly.

24:14.579 --> 24:17.039
She's gonna get burned.

24:17.081 --> 24:19.792
And what about the other matter?

24:19.834 --> 24:21.502
I'm not sure I understand

24:21.544 --> 24:24.714
-what we're looking for.
-Leverage.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.549
Who supports him,

24:26.591 --> 24:28.551
-who he owes, who has his ear.
-Quid pro quo

24:28.593 --> 24:30.386
is in every mayor's DNA.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.763
Are we talking about
criminal corruption or...?

24:32.805 --> 24:33.973
No. No, not at all.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.558
Just, um...

24:35.600 --> 24:38.394
something that
could look like it.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.062
If I need it to.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.023
Because of Sheehan?

24:42.064 --> 24:43.816
They're coming down on us again?

25:11.677 --> 25:13.387
Oh, come on!

25:13.429 --> 25:16.849
Are you guys ever gonna leave me
alone about this fucking thing?

25:16.891 --> 25:19.143
It's two years ago now.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.646
Didn't think it had anything
to do with you.

25:21.687 --> 25:24.523
Edgar, Bosch,
Hollywood Homicide.

25:25.942 --> 25:28.069
Nothing's locked.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.821
Place is all yours.
Knock yourself out.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.010
Where would you put it?

25:55.096 --> 25:56.681
Behind that.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.604
Huh.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.192
Wide-angle lens.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.902
We'd see the whole room.

26:12.488 --> 26:15.283
Bet there's a closet
on the other side.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.451
I don't know

26:17.493 --> 26:19.578
-about any camera.
-We dust the mirror and the wall

26:19.620 --> 26:22.248
behind it, whose prints
are we gonna find?

26:22.290 --> 26:25.501
Mirror was on a hook,
kept sliding around.

26:25.543 --> 26:27.169
When I changed the clamps,

26:27.211 --> 26:29.588
I had to take out the hook
and plaster over the hole.

26:29.630 --> 26:32.883
-Who'd ever see a hole behind
a mirror? -

26:35.428 --> 26:37.471
Pretty sure I did that wall work

26:37.513 --> 26:40.808
well before your black pencil
thing even happened.

26:40.850 --> 26:43.477
Pretty sure there was
a camera in there.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.564
If there was,
I had nothing to do with it.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.899
You hire other ex-cons
like Harris?

26:48.941 --> 26:52.278
I like to give them
a break, yeah.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.572
But they're cons.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.533
Okay.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.952
Sure, maybe it was one of them

26:59.994 --> 27:03.039
-put it in there.
-Or you, worried about drugs.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.750
You find one of those
little SD memory cards?

27:05.791 --> 27:06.959
There was no camera.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.627
Okay.

27:08.669 --> 27:11.464
I'm saying,
if there had been one there,

27:11.505 --> 27:14.383
how often would you check it?

27:19.263 --> 27:21.140
About once a week.

27:22.183 --> 27:24.310
Until I found it was gone.

27:24.352 --> 27:27.063
If... I found it was gone.

27:27.104 --> 27:29.231
My boss said I had to call you.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.234
I already talked to the Feds.

27:32.276 --> 27:33.778
We're on a different track.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.988
Eleanor Wish was
my partner's ex-wife.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.907
They have a daughter.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.743
This is family.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.661
I understand you're scared,

27:42.703 --> 27:45.414
but anything you can tell us
could be helpful.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.918
I don't like talking
on the phone.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.337
I'll come to you.
When and where?

27:52.380 --> 27:54.590
Thanks. I'll be there.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.594
The dealer that set up the game
at Golden Soup.

27:58.636 --> 28:01.263
-Pretty skittish.
-She'll meet with us?

28:01.305 --> 28:03.682
Chief Irving finds out
you're chasing this,

28:03.724 --> 28:05.434
he'll shut us down.

28:05.476 --> 28:08.646
I'm house mouse-- I go,
nobody's paying attention to me.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.481
What?

28:10.523 --> 28:13.067
Video doesn't
really change anything,

28:13.109 --> 28:14.652
in terms of Sheehan.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.445
I disagree.

28:16.487 --> 28:19.198
Now we know what he had,
maybe why he was killed.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.659
But not who took it,
not who gave it to him

28:21.700 --> 28:23.911
or where the hell it is.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.228
These are challenging times
for our city,

28:49.270 --> 28:52.648
but maybe, with our public
and private commitment

28:52.690 --> 28:55.734
to affordable housing,
it will help heal our divide.

28:55.776 --> 28:57.736
Speaking of the divide,

28:57.778 --> 28:59.780
I'm sorry to tell you

28:59.822 --> 29:01.782
that a rogue
Los Angeles police officer

29:01.824 --> 29:04.493
was taken into custody
in the murder

29:04.535 --> 29:07.496
of Howard Elias,
and the case will be presented

29:07.538 --> 29:10.291
to the district attorney
for charges.

29:10.332 --> 29:13.878
To make sure that the culture
of police misconduct

29:13.919 --> 29:17.923
that plagues our nation
does not infect our city...

29:17.965 --> 29:21.093
I'm forming
an independent civilian panel

29:21.135 --> 29:22.970
to oversee and review,

29:23.012 --> 29:24.597
going forward,

29:24.638 --> 29:27.016
every aspect of the
Los Angeles Police Department,

29:27.057 --> 29:29.852
and make it better.

29:29.894 --> 29:32.688
Thank you,
and God bless you all.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.825
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.411
-I just have one question,
if you have time? -Ms. Zealy.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.705
I feel like I already know you
from your social media.

29:49.747 --> 29:52.082
This new commission,
how can it be independent

29:52.124 --> 29:53.709
if it's privately funded?

29:53.751 --> 29:55.544
Where are you getting that?

29:55.586 --> 29:58.255
Well, I hear the money's
coming from Bradley Walker.

29:58.297 --> 30:01.800
You think it's wrong
to give the community a voice

30:01.842 --> 30:03.761
to investigate
police misconduct?

30:03.802 --> 30:06.263
You'll hear the people's
thoughts on Sunday.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.974
Mr. Mayor, I know you love
to engage with constituents,

30:09.016 --> 30:10.476
-but we...
-Hold on, Jen.

30:10.518 --> 30:12.478
You don't need
to investigate misconduct,

30:12.520 --> 30:13.771
you need to stop misconduct.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.774
People like us, people of color,

30:16.815 --> 30:18.901
always have a difficult choice.

30:18.943 --> 30:21.278
Yes, we all want justice.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.447
If you'll excuse us.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.658
President
of the Police Commission,

30:25.699 --> 30:28.452
big developer who works close
with City Council--

30:28.494 --> 30:30.162
where's the independence
in that?

30:30.204 --> 30:32.831
We choose...
to burn and destroy,

30:32.873 --> 30:36.252
or, with a perhaps naive hope,

30:36.293 --> 30:39.463
to create and to build.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.590
This... is my choice.

30:41.632 --> 30:44.552
False prophets, false choices--
that's the bottom line.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.470
You want to know my bottom line?

30:46.512 --> 30:48.556
Justice for L.A.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.534
Let me ask you something, Frank.

31:08.576 --> 31:12.705
Who was it cleared the
junkyard cameras during Kincaid?

31:12.746 --> 31:15.583
Drake

31:15.624 --> 31:17.626
Pipes?

31:17.668 --> 31:19.253
'Cause one of them...

31:19.295 --> 31:21.005
found another camera

31:21.046 --> 31:23.340
in the bathroom, held it back,

31:23.382 --> 31:25.092
then gave the tape...

31:25.134 --> 31:27.720
to Elias.

31:27.761 --> 31:29.555
Food for thought.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.059
I fucked up, Harry.

31:34.101 --> 31:36.729
I guess I should've killed
one of them, too, huh?

31:41.275 --> 31:44.069
Whatever you don't take,
I'm giving or throwing away.

31:44.111 --> 31:47.406
We only take evidence.

31:47.448 --> 31:50.242
But I'll send someone out
who can help you.

31:50.284 --> 31:52.369
Are you gonna charge him?

31:52.411 --> 31:53.495
He didn't do it.

31:53.537 --> 31:54.580
Anything?

31:54.622 --> 31:55.873
It's a man's life.

32:08.552 --> 32:11.430
If you could take all that?

32:11.472 --> 32:13.766
I don't know how to get rid
of it, and I don't want it here.

32:13.807 --> 32:16.644
It was just an excuse
for him to come back.

32:23.817 --> 32:25.611
Pierce.

32:47.216 --> 32:48.634
Jimmy.

32:48.676 --> 32:49.885
Found something
that might interest you

32:49.927 --> 32:51.095
out here in Sheehan's garage.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.347
Two extra barrels
for the Beretta,

32:53.389 --> 32:56.058
-and a box of hollow-points.
-Listening.

32:56.100 --> 32:59.728
Doesn't change my mind, but...
why didn't he swap barrels

32:59.770 --> 33:01.397
before he gave you his gun?

33:01.438 --> 33:02.981
And the hollow-points.

33:03.023 --> 33:06.318
Yeah. I mean,
one could argue a man so intent

33:06.360 --> 33:08.779
on taking out Howard Elias,
how come he didn't use them?

33:08.821 --> 33:10.280
You got an answer for me?

33:10.322 --> 33:11.865
I don't, no.

33:14.076 --> 33:16.120
You're welcome.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.830
Mm-hmm.

33:17.871 --> 33:19.873
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

33:19.915 --> 33:22.710
Rogow. T.D.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.712
His hit-and-run walked in.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.463
Voluntary surrender.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.841
Be nice if that caught on.
Was he texting?

33:28.882 --> 33:31.218
I don't know. He's getting
a warrant for the guy's phone.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.595
Guy says the cyclist
is at fault.

33:33.637 --> 33:37.266
Sure. Bike riders are always
trying to run SUVs off the road.

33:38.684 --> 33:41.311
Should we tell Rogow
before or after he files

33:41.353 --> 33:43.355
that his vehicular assailant
may be a hero?

33:43.397 --> 33:45.691
Hey, hey, hey,
don't jinx our prints.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.901
They ever give out medals
during sentencing?

33:47.943 --> 33:50.821
Only in the court
of poetic justice.

33:58.287 --> 34:00.414
So no funeral, huh?

34:00.456 --> 34:02.666
She didn't want one.

34:09.882 --> 34:13.093
It still doesn't feel real.

34:13.135 --> 34:14.720
No.

34:14.762 --> 34:16.847
-It won't...
-

34:16.889 --> 34:18.807
until it does.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.435
And it will...
in its own time.

34:23.020 --> 34:26.231
Which, uh, may or may not be
when you want it to.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.026
That's comforting.

34:47.920 --> 34:52.674
There is something breeding
in this fridge.

34:52.716 --> 34:55.761
Mom thought sell-by dates
were suggestions.

35:40.097 --> 35:42.474
-Webson.
-Danny, Harry Bosch here.

35:42.516 --> 35:44.893
You did the match
on the Elias case--

35:44.935 --> 35:47.145
-what's the margin of error?
-None.

35:47.187 --> 35:49.106
Well, it's never
a hundred percent.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.732
The barrel striations
were so clean,

35:50.774 --> 35:52.025
I could've done it naked eye.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.820
-Sheehan's nine.
-I'd put money on it.

35:55.863 --> 35:57.364
Okay. Thanks.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.492
It's me. Hip deep.

36:00.534 --> 36:02.703
Not gonna be able to
pick the boys up later.

36:02.744 --> 36:05.581
I'll be there for dinner
if that's still good.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.040
I owe you one.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.338
Detective Edgar.

36:16.091 --> 36:18.135
I don't know why I'm so--
I mean, I'm not even...

36:18.176 --> 36:20.929
It's just that, you-you know,
you hear these stories

36:20.971 --> 36:24.224
about gangs and...

36:24.266 --> 36:26.143
Was Eleanor undercover?

36:26.184 --> 36:27.769
Is that why they killed her?

36:27.811 --> 36:31.189
Is that why who killed her?

36:31.231 --> 36:34.234
Step by step.

36:34.276 --> 36:35.569
You put a poker game together.

36:35.611 --> 36:37.529
Two whales from Shanghai.

36:37.571 --> 36:39.656
They wanted a challenge.
Good players.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.286
Eleanor's real good.

36:44.328 --> 36:47.581
Whales have names?

36:47.623 --> 36:49.917
Ken Lin was the one
who hired me.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.627
His cousin manages the place
we played at.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.837
-Golden Soup.
-Yeah.

36:53.879 --> 36:57.049
Ting... something.

36:57.090 --> 37:00.802
I never got the rest
of his name.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.888
And the guy who came late?

37:04.514 --> 37:06.391
You know about that?

37:12.314 --> 37:14.107
Yeah, I never saw him before.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.028
He's from the mainland.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.988
Something about...

37:20.030 --> 37:23.659
the whales missing
their flight back.

37:23.700 --> 37:27.037
He went postal on Ken.

37:27.079 --> 37:29.289
It was bad.

37:29.331 --> 37:30.958
Really scary.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.417
Ting know who he was?

37:32.459 --> 37:34.628
I don't know. He seemed to.

37:36.380 --> 37:37.798
How's her daughter?

37:39.716 --> 37:41.468
Holding up.

37:41.510 --> 37:43.178
It's hard.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.850
The Feds say they can protect me
if I have to testify.

37:48.892 --> 37:50.268
They can.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.437
But for how long?

38:00.320 --> 38:01.780
Thank you, Ida.

38:03.365 --> 38:04.992
Commissioner.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.577
Harry Bosch came through like
a champ on Elias, Irv.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.497
Well, still some work
to be done, but, yes,

38:10.539 --> 38:13.125
-he's a good detective.
-And you're a hell of a chief.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.544
Now, if you could finesse
Justice Now

38:15.585 --> 38:18.088
and avert a riot...

38:18.130 --> 38:19.715
I'm kidding.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.883
Great job.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.845
Thanks.

38:24.886 --> 38:27.097
And your support is
much appreciated.

38:27.139 --> 38:30.475
And, um, well, I may need it.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.436
What for?

38:32.477 --> 38:35.564
The mayor's new
independent probe into LAPD.

38:35.605 --> 38:38.108
This may end up in a showdown,

38:38.150 --> 38:41.236
and I'm grateful that we have
each others' backs.

38:42.779 --> 38:45.323
If it comes to that.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.409
I would like to think
that the three of us

38:47.451 --> 38:49.619
could find a way to both
serve the department's needs

38:49.661 --> 38:51.371
and the mayor's ambitions.

38:52.664 --> 38:56.418
-I'm less sanguine.
-Anyway...

38:56.460 --> 38:59.379
There is a more mundane matter
you could help me with.

39:01.089 --> 39:04.009
RHD is looking for
a construction worker

39:04.051 --> 39:05.761
who may have information
on an arson-murder.

39:05.802 --> 39:08.138
And...?

39:08.180 --> 39:11.016
If you'd encourage your foreman
to cooperate, I'd appreciate it.

39:11.058 --> 39:13.769
That sounds like a long shot.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.187
Recent?

39:15.228 --> 39:17.189
Last fall.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.941
Retirement home.
Three victims.

39:19.983 --> 39:21.818
Worker have a name?

39:21.860 --> 39:24.738
Bondigas. Alberto.

39:24.780 --> 39:27.783
Well, I'll get the word out.

39:27.824 --> 39:28.784
Thank you.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.203
And again...

39:33.288 --> 39:36.458
...congratulations on Elias.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.799
When?

39:43.840 --> 39:46.009
Monday. I've been trying to
reach you.

39:46.051 --> 39:49.596
And no one knows who or why?

39:49.638 --> 39:52.390
No one knows anything.

39:58.814 --> 40:01.108
Where are you?

40:01.149 --> 40:04.236
Hong Kong.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.655
I'm back in Hong Kong.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.262
I wish I was there with you.

40:30.303 --> 40:33.098
Me, too.

40:35.392 --> 40:37.644
In this life,
we get two families, Maddie.

40:37.686 --> 40:40.522
One we're born with
and one we choose.

40:45.944 --> 40:49.072
And your...

40:49.114 --> 40:53.493
y-your mom and you...

40:53.535 --> 40:57.455
you're who I chose. Mm.

41:10.302 --> 41:13.180
Jesus, your dad.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.307
He was with her.

41:53.053 --> 41:55.597
I was thinking I might
come to Hong Kong.

41:55.639 --> 41:58.225
You can't.

41:58.266 --> 42:00.769
Not now. After I graduate.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.229
You can't, Maddie.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.522
Why not?

42:06.983 --> 42:08.026
Someone's there with you.

42:12.239 --> 42:14.282
Your mother's federal friends

42:14.324 --> 42:16.701
used her to look into my family.

42:16.743 --> 42:18.203
It broke my heart.

42:21.456 --> 42:24.125
Nothing came of it.

42:24.167 --> 42:25.835
I am now

42:25.877 --> 42:29.422
suspected of being an
unregistered foreign agent.

42:31.925 --> 42:35.220
I was invited to discuss it
with government officials

42:35.262 --> 42:37.764
in a detention center
outside of Chengdu.

42:37.806 --> 42:39.349
Because of what Mom did?

42:39.391 --> 42:41.726
No.

42:41.768 --> 42:43.645
I don't know.

42:47.524 --> 42:49.651
I'm sorry, Maddie.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.448
But it's going to be okay.

42:55.490 --> 42:57.450
We go on.

42:57.492 --> 43:00.161
When will I see you again?

43:03.206 --> 43:05.208
You're seeing me now.

43:07.794 --> 43:10.797
You think Bosch is right
about Sheehan being innocent?

43:10.839 --> 43:11.923
I want him to be.

43:11.965 --> 43:14.259
I think I know what you mean.

43:14.301 --> 43:16.177
To protect and serve,
that's a real thing for me.

43:16.219 --> 43:18.680
...no peace. -It's not
that simple, youngblood.

43:18.722 --> 43:20.265
No justice, no peace.

43:20.307 --> 43:21.766
It's just hard to hold
the line sometimes.

43:21.808 --> 43:23.893
You wait ten years,
get back to me.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.562
No justice,
no peace. No justice,

43:25.603 --> 43:28.565
-no peace...
-No shit.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.358
...no peace.
No justice, no peace.

43:32.152 --> 43:34.154
Fuck.

43:34.195 --> 43:35.655
-I'll call it.
-

43:40.910 --> 43:42.996
Officer needs help.
Back gate of Hollywood Division.

43:44.456 --> 43:46.833
Pierce,
where the fuck you going?!

43:46.875 --> 43:49.669
William-51. We're code six.

43:49.711 --> 43:53.006
Our vehicle's been hit
by an incendiary device.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.727
Dig it. Jack Teagarden.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.105
I need to see all the evidence

44:09.147 --> 44:13.068
on D.R. number 12-0311524.

44:13.109 --> 44:15.236
And you can turn that back up
while you're looking,

44:15.278 --> 44:17.238
'cause there's a Ben Webster
solo coming up.

44:40.136 --> 44:42.389
John Hancock and thumb.

45:09.332 --> 45:11.126
That was quick.

45:11.167 --> 45:12.752
Something missing.

45:12.794 --> 45:13.920
I'm shocked.

45:13.962 --> 45:15.130
Take a look,

45:15.171 --> 45:17.048
see who checked it out last.

45:21.803 --> 45:24.848
Hmm. Snyder, Amy.

45:24.889 --> 45:26.683
Two days ago.

45:29.018 --> 45:30.854
Thanks.
