it's from Toph, who wants to apologize.

Nah, she's pretty much a pain.

She's always got to be right
about everything,

how you can deal with it.

When our mom died,

Our family was a mess, but Katara,
she had so much strength.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.830
She stepped up
and took on so much responsibility.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.580

that was left by our mom.

what my mother looked like.

Katara's been the one looking out for me.

She's always been the one that's there,
and now...

16:16.310 --> 16:20.940
When I try to remember my mom,
Katara's is the only face I can picture.

16:21.570 --> 16:25.190
TOPH: The truth is,
sometimes Katara does act motherly,

16:25.440 --> 16:27.150
but that's not always a bad thing.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.780
