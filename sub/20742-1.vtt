What the hell's going on?

00:57.415 --> 00:59.113
No, it just happened.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.872
Everything went black.

01:16.301 --> 01:17.382
We got juice.

01:17.432 --> 01:19.277
Yeah... sir, they just went back on.

01:19.528 --> 01:21.323
How the hell should I know?

01:25.509 --> 01:26.920
Holy shit.

Sonya Cross.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.470
El Paso Homicide.

03:26.115 --> 03:27.701
You know who she is?

03:27.821 --> 03:29.411
She's American.

03:30.612 --> 03:32.033
Okay.

03:34.992 --> 03:37.257
Lorraine Gates, the judge.

03:38.977 --> 03:42.613
There's a gal asking to
talk to the cop in charge.

03:44.903 --> 03:45.873
She's American.

03:45.935 --> 03:47.794
The car came from El Paso.

03:48.213 --> 03:49.633
It's ours.

03:51.454 --> 03:52.812
Okay.

04:02.183 --> 04:03.691
Detective Sonya Cross.

04:03.735 --> 04:04.892
You have information?

04:05.012 --> 04:07.344
No, we just need to cross the bridge.

04:07.363 --> 04:08.608
Oh.

04:08.989 --> 04:10.335
You'll have to wait.

04:10.403 --> 04:11.974
We can't wait.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.539
My husband is having a heart attack.

04:15.659 --> 04:17.466
This is a crime scene.

04:17.587 --> 04:19.188
We need a hospital.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.235
The bridge is closed.

04:23.787 --> 04:25.018
Wait...

04:25.138 --> 04:26.745
I... I can pay you

04:26.865 --> 04:28.322
to let us cross.

04:28.391 --> 04:29.573
Ma'am...

04:29.830 --> 04:31.225
you can't cross.

04:31.345 --> 04:32.583
There are rules.

04:32.703 --> 04:34.072
This is a crime scene.

04:34.247 --> 04:36.117
I can't let you through.

04:41.471 --> 04:43.812
What were you doing in Juarez?

04:45.170 --> 04:47.091
Don't you know danger?

04:49.118 --> 04:51.432
We were just looking at some horses.

05:09.202 --> 05:10.047
Officer...

05:11.430 --> 05:13.938
- what was the make and model of the car?
- I don't know.

05:15.633 --> 05:16.788
It's your job to know.

05:16.979 --> 05:19.137
Our job is border
security and interdiction,

05:19.181 --> 05:20.558
not dead bodies, ma'am.

05:20.607 --> 05:22.409
The car would've crossed
over into Juarez...

05:22.440 --> 05:24.292
And that makes it Mexico's problem.

05:24.767 --> 05:25.618
Stop... hey!

05:25.738 --> 05:26.632
Stop!

05:27.182 --> 05:28.551
Hey!

05:28.984 --> 05:30.672
Stop!

05:35.409 --> 05:37.812
Who authorized that?

05:37.874 --> 05:39.000
Huh?

05:41.032 --> 05:42.254
I did.

05:44.935 --> 05:46.665
You compromised the scene.

05:46.683 --> 05:48.241
Her husband was very sick.

05:48.298 --> 05:49.762
What's your name, again?

05:50.250 --> 05:51.483
Marco Ruiz.

05:52.008 --> 05:53.216
Badge number?

05:55.869 --> 05:57.601
He needed a hospital.

05:57.882 --> 05:59.359
There are hospitals in Mexico.

05:59.372 --> 06:02.187
They're American, they
wanted an American hospital.

06:02.412 --> 06:03.751
Why does that matter?

06:04.095 --> 06:05.691
It does.

06:07.192 --> 06:08.187
Here.

06:09.432 --> 06:10.370
No right.

06:10.383 --> 06:11.928
This is a U.S. case.

06:12.630 --> 06:13.792
I don't need your body.

06:14.262 --> 06:16.551
Just this morning, I got nine heads

06:16.671 --> 06:18.578
in the parking lot of City Hall.

06:19.403 --> 06:21.103
Why tell me that?

06:21.331 --> 06:23.177
We've got our own dead.

06:23.765 --> 06:25.485
How do you let that happen?

06:30.228 --> 06:31.679
Okay, muchachos.

06:31.799 --> 06:34.413
The guerare taking the body,
I'm going back to sleep.

07:20.855 --> 07:22.563
For your tears.

07:31.147 --> 07:33.212
Are you the one?

07:35.208 --> 07:36.222
Yes.

07:41.872 --> 07:43.498
I am the one.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.815
___

08:03.115 --> 08:04.786
Shh.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.670
No, no, no, esperate.

I'm done.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.571
Whoa!

08:51.603 --> 08:52.892
Oh, shit.

09:19.483 --> 09:21.372
He said it's a routine procedure.

09:21.404 --> 09:22.811
Nothing to it.

09:23.587 --> 09:25.083
Charlotte...

09:27.048 --> 09:28.362
Charlotte...

09:29.281 --> 09:30.759
I'm right here.

09:31.508 --> 09:33.629
I saw the other side.

09:35.055 --> 09:37.226
I mean the goddamned hereafter.

09:37.270 --> 09:38.516
Oh, I know.

09:38.853 --> 09:40.592
Made me realize...

09:42.062 --> 09:44.273
you got to get your life right.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.055
My life is just right.

09:48.299 --> 09:49.450
Charlotte...

09:50.270 --> 09:52.122
I have to tell you something.

09:52.973 --> 09:54.249
Okay.

09:55.838 --> 09:57.501
I don't love you.

09:58.403 --> 10:00.361
I want a divorce.

10:06.849 --> 10:08.695
Are you sure it's Judge Gates?

10:08.966 --> 10:10.466
In two pieces.

10:10.679 --> 10:11.633
Damn.

10:12.556 --> 10:14.585
The Mexicans didn't want the body.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.110
The feds?

10:16.341 --> 10:17.492
They don't know yet.

10:18.068 --> 10:19.407
Well, they will.

10:19.527 --> 10:21.196
Border patrol,

10:21.316 --> 10:23.724
DEA, ICE, FBI...

10:23.742 --> 10:25.951
come morning, they'll all
be sticking their beaks in.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.390
It's mine, Hank.

10:28.472 --> 10:30.675
Yeah, right now, it is.

10:30.862 --> 10:32.654
So you know the feds are gonna want in.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.986
Can you protect me?

10:36.262 --> 10:37.707
Yeah, I'll do my level best.

10:37.731 --> 10:39.215
How the hell do you work this thing?

10:39.259 --> 10:40.316
What?

10:40.954 --> 10:43.250
Lorraine Gates on the
bridge of the Americas.

10:43.732 --> 10:45.922
I think somebody's
trying to send a message.

10:46.898 --> 10:48.174
What kind of message?

10:48.624 --> 10:50.501
Well, she's anti-immigration,

10:50.732 --> 10:53.248
she believes in the wall, anti-dream act.

10:53.448 --> 10:54.992
Hell, she don't like Mexicans,

10:55.011 --> 10:57.419
thinks they ought to stay in Mexico.

10:57.745 --> 10:59.090
Have you told the family yet?

10:59.210 --> 11:00.585
I'm on my way now.

11:01.167 --> 11:01.936
It's the middle of the night

11:01.955 --> 11:03.275
and there are children in that house.

11:03.395 --> 11:04.339
I know.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.534
So tread lightly.

11:05.654 --> 11:06.687
Their mother was murdered...

11:06.687 --> 11:08.070
there's no other way to say it.

11:09.771 --> 11:10.885
Right, well, remember

11:10.910 --> 11:12.637
eye contact, all right?

11:12.956 --> 11:13.888
Right.

11:14.363 --> 11:15.240
I will.

11:17.330 --> 11:19.031
Good morning, Lieutenant.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.771
Good morning, Miss Kitty.

11:22.798 --> 11:24.893
How in the Sam Hill do you work this thing?

11:25.313 --> 11:27.052
I just go to Starbucks.

11:35.573 --> 11:37.281
When was the last time
you talked to your wife?

11:37.350 --> 11:38.389
She, uh...

11:38.509 --> 11:41.280
she was going to Austin for a conference.

11:45.152 --> 11:46.498
Flying?

11:48.287 --> 11:50.239
No, she drove.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.526
I called her around 10:30 but...

11:56.433 --> 11:58.060
there was no answer.

11:58.867 --> 12:00.431
She was dead by then.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.677
Excuse me?

12:04.642 --> 12:05.956
Wh... which is...

12:06.076 --> 12:08.045
is very sad for you.

12:09.421 --> 12:11.236
Yeah.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.778
Would you like a glass of water?

12:19.976 --> 12:21.478
How was she killed?

12:23.036 --> 12:25.501
I mean, what did they do to her? Did...

12:26.709 --> 12:28.398
we have two little kids.

12:33.147 --> 12:35.268
Would you like a glass of water?

12:39.022 --> 12:40.161
No.

12:43.445 --> 12:44.954
I'm gonna need your phone.

12:51.773 --> 12:53.206
Okay.

13:00.932 --> 13:02.584
Password-protected?

13:03.441 --> 13:05.299
I don't even know how to do that.

13:08.765 --> 13:10.792
Any recent threats?

13:11.706 --> 13:13.658
Judges get lots of threats.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.548
That's why I'm asking.

13:18.049 --> 13:20.815
She just made a ruling
against some Mexicans.

13:21.515 --> 13:23.287
You know, stopping them from standing on

13:23.318 --> 13:25.082
the corners looking for work.

13:26.808 --> 13:28.167
Why?

13:28.912 --> 13:29.924
Why what?

13:30.044 --> 13:31.927
Why can't they stand at a corner?

13:35.149 --> 13:36.532
Uh...

13:36.652 --> 13:38.440
it's a traffic issue.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.087
You have a right to
stand on a public street.

13:41.506 --> 13:43.308
And to signal by your presence in that

13:43.333 --> 13:45.110
particular place that
you're looking for day work.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.269
What the hell are you talking about?

13:51.267 --> 13:52.731
Any affairs?

13:52.993 --> 13:54.639
No!

13:54.971 --> 13:55.997
Of course not.

13:56.117 --> 13:57.304
Drugs?

13:58.386 --> 14:00.877
Lorraine was a mother, for Christ's sake.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.210
My mother used drugs.

14:04.249 --> 14:05.694
Okay, that's it.

14:06.514 --> 14:09.805
Lady, I want you the hell out of my house.

14:11.607 --> 14:12.952
I...

14:25.397 --> 14:28.638
I'm sorry if I didn't exercise empathy.

14:56.305 --> 14:57.362
Gus.

15:00.359 --> 15:01.748
Gus.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.951
What?

15:05.064 --> 15:06.366
I can smell it.

15:06.486 --> 15:07.429
What?

15:07.549 --> 15:09.481
CÃ³mo what?

15:09.838 --> 15:11.827
The dope; la mota.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.644
Where'd you get it?

15:15.869 --> 15:17.571
De Tico in school.

15:18.734 --> 15:21.112
Do you know who Tico's Uncle is?

15:23.696 --> 15:25.373
Aurelio Guetta,

15:25.754 --> 15:26.736
hmm?

15:27.287 --> 15:28.633
Ring a bell?

15:30.641 --> 15:32.505
That's where your dope comes from.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.564
It was just a joint.

15:35.296 --> 15:36.923
Well, now you owe him.

15:37.611 --> 15:39.613
Maybe his Uncle will ask you to

15:39.600 --> 15:41.421
make a delivery for him.

15:41.909 --> 15:43.548
Drive him somewhere.

15:44.230 --> 15:46.027
- That's not how it is, okay?
- Oh, no.

15:46.147 --> 15:47.940
AsÃ­ es como es.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.331
That is exactly the way it is.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.732
That's how you get caught up.

15:57.951 --> 16:01.042
All right, esos culeros, they reach out

16:01.499 --> 16:02.744
and get you like that.

16:02.757 --> 16:04.677
Hmm? Como mosquito.

16:06.942 --> 16:10.427
You're going across for class,
coming right back, all right?

16:12.373 --> 16:14.112
No parties, no Tico.

16:14.869 --> 16:16.014
Understand?

16:18.061 --> 16:19.060
Okay.

16:19.062 --> 16:19.705
Okay?

16:19.918 --> 16:21.407
___

16:21.527 --> 16:23.478
___

16:23.972 --> 16:25.211
Okay.

16:33.836 --> 16:36.514
- Did you check on Gus?
- Yes.

16:38.447 --> 16:40.105
___

16:40.481 --> 16:41.888
___

16:43.546 --> 16:45.092
___

16:46.156 --> 16:48.295
___

16:50.285 --> 16:52.025
Maybe he had, um...

16:52.788 --> 16:54.284
night class.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.642
- No. No, he didn't.
- No?

16:58.781 --> 17:00.177
Well...

17:00.458 --> 17:02.091
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

17:13.344 --> 17:15.733
I don't know how you stand this place.

17:15.854 --> 17:17.848
You learn so much at autopsy.

17:19.432 --> 17:22.196
So, uh, did, uh, you go
easy on the judge's husband?

17:22.654 --> 17:23.810
Yeah.

17:24.223 --> 17:25.675
Well...

17:25.996 --> 17:27.429
Sonya.

17:27.431 --> 17:28.630
I tried.

17:29.755 --> 17:31.844
- Anyway, he didn't do it.
- No?

17:32.301 --> 17:33.947
Talked about all the right things.

17:33.984 --> 17:35.123
Gave up his phone,

17:35.160 --> 17:36.919
which he doesn't even
know how to lock, so...

17:37.039 --> 17:39.666
that's not the guy who wired
the bridge lights to go out.

17:39.685 --> 17:40.692
That's a good point.

17:40.717 --> 17:42.963
- Our guy has tech skills.
- Hey...

17:43.758 --> 17:45.510
All right, meet you in there.

17:45.747 --> 17:49.063
Got to warn Carmen she's
waking up to an empty bed.

17:59.367 --> 18:00.793
Morning, Sonya.

18:01.444 --> 18:02.658
Okay.

18:03.546 --> 18:05.336
Cause of death's right here.

18:05.456 --> 18:07.901
Needle in the base of the
spine and into the brain.

18:07.958 --> 18:11.142
Quick, easy, almost painless.

18:11.843 --> 18:13.363
This is a good one.

18:13.858 --> 18:15.372
Gloves.

18:20.502 --> 18:22.297
You been by to see him?

18:24.649 --> 18:26.264
Not recently.

18:27.697 --> 18:28.773
Good.

18:29.073 --> 18:30.988
Don't give him the satisfaction.

18:31.532 --> 18:33.396
Denise.

18:33.747 --> 18:35.280
Get your hands dirty, Hank?

18:35.336 --> 18:37.454
- Pass.
- All right.

18:38.974 --> 18:40.501
Perfect bisection.

18:40.914 --> 18:42.239
Keep going.

18:42.558 --> 18:44.510
Denise, just come on with it.

18:44.630 --> 18:46.156
Check out the other half.

18:55.059 --> 18:57.581
White arms, brown legs.

18:59.702 --> 19:01.259
Two different women?

19:01.678 --> 19:03.443
This one's a hispanic female.

19:03.468 --> 19:05.307
Late teens, early 20s.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.689
Son of a bitch.

19:29.045 --> 19:30.646
Passport?

19:37.741 --> 19:39.518
How long were you in Mexico?

19:39.849 --> 19:41.100
A few hours.

19:41.307 --> 19:43.165
What'd you bring back from Mexico?

19:43.478 --> 19:45.542
Uh, just a smile, officer.

19:46.612 --> 19:48.370
What were you doin' in Juarez?

19:48.549 --> 19:49.853
Seeing a friend.

19:50.384 --> 19:51.736
Yeah?

19:52.319 --> 19:53.956
I got a friend in Juarez.

19:55.364 --> 19:57.461
Ain't seen him in six years.

19:57.658 --> 19:58.906
Ain't worth getting shot.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.370
Yeah, okay.

20:01.915 --> 20:04.637
Listen, man, I...

20:05.757 --> 20:08.647
I was there for the seÃ±oritas.

20:11.926 --> 20:13.572
Anything good?

20:14.228 --> 20:16.843
Oh, it's definitely worth a visit.

20:21.516 --> 20:23.481
You have a good night.

21:31.485 --> 21:32.499
Mm.

21:33.699 --> 21:36.114
The one in charge. I remember.

21:37.184 --> 21:38.657
Were you sleeping?

21:39.048 --> 21:41.313
I do that at night, yes.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.596
There were two women on the bridge.

21:46.393 --> 21:48.163
You found another one?

21:48.469 --> 21:50.227
No. Two different bodies.

21:50.452 --> 21:52.337
A lower half and an upper half.

Two different women.

___

21:58.679 --> 22:00.695

22:00.815 --> 22:02.672
Hispanic, late teens to 20.

22:02.683 --> 22:04.186
You would have the upper half.

22:04.618 --> 22:06.283
Ouch!

22:08.035 --> 22:09.305
Something wrong?

22:09.623 --> 22:11.459
No, no. I'm listening.

22:12.216 --> 22:13.311
Cut in half?

22:13.361 --> 22:14.600
Yes. Do you have a girl

22:14.613 --> 22:16.083

Well, we have lots of bodies,

22:23.390 --> 22:24.860
It could be a year old.

22:24.904 --> 22:26.537
Her legs were frozen.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.472
Frozen...

22:29.474 --> 22:31.336
Yes. Can you look into it?

22:31.380 --> 22:32.256
Of course, yeah.

22:32.256 --> 22:34.201
I'll do it first thing in the morning.

Sheriff's boys are looking

19.

28:54.978 --> 28:58.586
Came north to work in the maquiladoras.

Partial remains...

Partial remains found in a
death house with 22 others.

29:07.882 --> 29:09.146
Yeah, old buildings

29:09.196 --> 29:11.261

Fill up one, find another.

29:14.996 --> 29:16.403
When was she found?

29:16.523 --> 29:18.168
About a year and a half ago.

29:18.362 --> 29:19.451
It matches.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.759
Can you send the file?

29:20.809 --> 29:23.043
I think it's better if I come to you.

29:23.163 --> 29:24.545

29:25.120 --> 29:26.365

29:27.283 --> 29:28.743

Hello?

Good.

29:47.132 --> 29:48.468
Why is that good?

29:48.470 --> 29:50.386
Well, he's got a body of his own, right?

29:50.567 --> 29:51.800
He doesn't care about his.

29:52.006 --> 29:54.909
He called you at 4:00 A.M.
with her name, didn't he?

29:56.899 --> 29:58.276
Fine.

29:59.802 --> 30:00.904
We got two bodies

30:00.916 --> 30:02.806
directly on an international border.

30:02.812 --> 30:04.877
This case is gonna take us down south.

going to be a task force.

34:10.850 --> 34:12.572
Oh... probably.

34:13.014 --> 34:14.928

35:19.773 --> 35:21.513
The ones with walnuts are really good.

35:21.550 --> 35:23.922
N... oh, hell, okay.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.016
Okay...

35:25.136 --> 35:27.563
It's just... thank you.

35:27.619 --> 35:28.432
There you go.

35:28.676 --> 35:30.447
Just keep it here for a coffee break.

35:30.466 --> 35:31.811
Oh, all right, then.

35:31.855 --> 35:33.926
Thank you.

35:34.182 --> 35:35.396
See you later, Kitty.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.879
I hope so.

35:42.087 --> 35:43.928
- Can we start?
- Yep.

35:45.060 --> 35:46.981
- You have your badge?
- Yup.

35:51.467 --> 35:53.857
- Need me to translate for you?
- No.

35:54.257 --> 35:56.034
- Hablas espaÃ±ol?
- Bastante.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.466
Oh, que bien.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.940
Can you sit?

36:08.634 --> 36:12.269
Uh... no, actually, I can't.

36:14.453 --> 36:15.785
You're irritating me.

36:16.179 --> 36:17.575
Oh.

36:18.188 --> 36:20.997
Then I just stand still.

36:24.643 --> 36:26.126
Why can't you sit?

36:28.566 --> 36:30.662
I had a procedure...

36:31.288 --> 36:34.704
a vasectomy, a few days back.

36:36.130 --> 36:38.032
I already have three children.

36:38.264 --> 36:39.944
Two marriages.

36:40.064 --> 36:41.705
It was time.

36:43.950 --> 36:46.191
Do you have any children?

36:49.838 --> 36:50.889
No.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.312
Why not?

36:58.163 --> 37:00.881
Evidence is collected but never processed.

37:02.051 --> 37:04.172
Huh. Yeah? Yeah.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.474
Yes.

37:08.632 --> 37:11.523
- You drove here, right?
- Yup.

37:11.643 --> 37:13.562
Pretend that chair is a car.

37:14.132 --> 37:16.722
So... sorry.

37:17.479 --> 37:19.131
Okay.

37:19.732 --> 37:21.396
I'll try.

37:21.909 --> 37:23.492
How was she killed?

37:26.125 --> 37:27.396
I don't know.

37:29.499 --> 37:30.856
Your name's on the report.

37:30.976 --> 37:33.278
Yeah, my name is on a lot of reports.

37:34.166 --> 37:36.691
There are no interviews,
not even with her parents.

37:41.671 --> 37:44.174
(Speaks Spanish)

37:45.237 --> 37:48.522
"From the bowl to the
mouth, the soup falls."

37:49.911 --> 37:52.082
What does that have to do with this?

37:52.407 --> 37:56.693
Cristina Fuentes is only one of 250 girls

37:57.037 --> 37:59.108
who disappeared last year.

37:59.384 --> 38:02.518
They go missing from the
buses, the factories...

38:03.281 --> 38:05.777
always 15 to 20 years old,

38:05.897 --> 38:08.085
dark hair, beautiful.

38:08.774 --> 38:10.526
So, you have a serial killer?

38:11.371 --> 38:12.597
No one knows.

38:14.618 --> 38:16.695
A... and no one tries to find out?

38:18.403 --> 38:19.961
There are just...

38:20.456 --> 38:21.588
too many.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.248
And the chiefs...

38:25.316 --> 38:28.163
they really don't want us to investigate.

38:29.255 --> 38:30.590
Easier that way.

38:32.517 --> 38:33.781
Easier how?

38:33.787 --> 38:35.783
Hey, I'm Lieutenant Hank Wade.

38:35.777 --> 38:37.444
Mucho gusto. Marco Ruiz.

38:38.045 --> 38:40.472
His name is on the report
for Cristina Fuentes.

38:41.233 --> 38:43.074
But he didn't investigate at all.

38:45.295 --> 38:47.203
Well, now he gets a second chance.

38:47.579 --> 38:49.787
Sheriff's department found the judge's car.

38:49.837 --> 38:50.600
Where?

38:50.650 --> 38:52.816
Off of highway 180.

38:54.980 --> 38:56.857
- I guess she's driving.
- Yup.

38:57.439 --> 38:58.709
- Bit of advice.
- Yeah?

38:58.753 --> 39:01.442
- Buckle up, amigo.
- I will.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.418
This all we got?

39:23.765 --> 39:24.835
Tape's stuck.

39:24.885 --> 39:26.105
I can get it out.

39:26.167 --> 39:27.406
Don't!

39:35.720 --> 39:37.897
The truck was my sister's.

39:39.125 --> 39:40.344
She died.

39:43.485 --> 39:45.124
I'm sorry.

39:49.566 --> 39:51.530
So, you like horses?

39:53.606 --> 39:54.896
No.

40:05.207 --> 40:07.109
Did you take money from that woman?

40:07.885 --> 40:09.055
What woman?

40:09.090 --> 40:11.443
On the bridge. To let her pass.

40:12.037 --> 40:13.476
No.

40:16.295 --> 40:17.962
They say you're all corrupt.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.815
Mexican police, you all take bribes.

40:22.779 --> 40:24.306
Not all of us.

40:25.338 --> 40:28.296
The cartels threaten everyone, and...

40:30.699 --> 40:32.926
sometimes, for some people,

40:32.951 --> 40:34.821
it's a lot easier to just...

40:35.314 --> 40:36.773
look the other way.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.538
For a price, of course.

40:39.385 --> 40:41.960
They give you money so you
won't do the police work?

40:42.430 --> 40:43.800
Not exactly.

40:43.920 --> 40:46.541
They tell you, "plata o plomo."

40:47.326 --> 40:49.362
"Take our silver,

40:49.482 --> 40:51.233
or take our lead."

40:55.501 --> 40:57.589
So, you just let the girls die?

41:03.020 --> 41:05.110
I do the best I can.

41:06.345 --> 41:08.451
But the situation is...

41:10.616 --> 41:12.067
(Speaks Spanish)

41:13.087 --> 41:14.582
You should try harder.

41:17.035 --> 41:19.425
Of course I should.

41:40.069 --> 41:41.987
I heard about seÃ±or Karl, seÃ±ora.

41:45.328 --> 41:46.941
Did you tell the rest of the staff?

41:47.061 --> 41:48.319
Yes.

41:49.132 --> 41:51.515
Good. Because I don't want to be disturbed.

41:54.212 --> 41:56.426
(Speaks Spanish)

43:23.763 --> 43:25.050
Bueno? Karl?

43:28.798 --> 43:29.843
Who is this?

43:41.900 --> 43:43.877
No one has bothered you, huh?

43:44.415 --> 43:46.380
No.

43:48.344 --> 43:50.259
This was in Karl's pocket.

43:50.813 --> 43:52.642
Have you seen it before?

43:56.346 --> 43:57.860
No. Why?

43:58.148 --> 43:59.857
A woman called for him.

44:02.722 --> 44:05.230
He's gone, Cesar. You answer to me now.

44:05.749 --> 44:07.613
SÃ­, seÃ±ora.

44:08.298 --> 44:09.635
Who is she?

44:11.061 --> 44:12.551
I don't know.

44:13.804 --> 44:15.147
What about this?

44:16.617 --> 44:18.150
I found it in his wallet.

44:18.484 --> 44:20.115
Miss Charlotte, I don't know. I...

44:20.133 --> 44:21.635
You're lying, Cesar.

44:21.755 --> 44:23.556
What is it?

44:26.815 --> 44:28.692
It's better that I show you.

44:30.850 --> 44:32.227
Come.

44:38.646 --> 44:40.548
Where are we going?

44:40.798 --> 44:42.506
It's just a little further.

44:43.542 --> 44:46.041
I've never seen this part of the ranch.

44:55.275 --> 44:56.570
Come.

45:30.529 --> 45:31.687
Down there.

45:45.896 --> 45:48.566
Oh, goddamn it, Cesar, I don't like this.

45:50.750 --> 45:52.902
It's okay, seÃ±ora. Come.

45:54.491 --> 45:55.780
There.

45:57.857 --> 45:59.959
Is that what the key's for?

46:01.511 --> 46:02.993
SÃ­, seÃ±ora.

46:22.175 --> 46:24.115
What's in there?

47:14.730 --> 47:16.326
Ma'am,

47:16.446 --> 47:18.072
you may not want to look.

47:18.410 --> 47:19.742
Excuse me.

47:19.862 --> 47:22.220
Of course, it's county jurisdiction.

47:22.551 --> 47:25.342
The case originated with El Paso PD.

47:25.367 --> 47:27.606
Sheriff's department found her body.

47:28.220 --> 47:29.377
Course...

47:30.075 --> 47:32.706
This is my case, not the county's.

47:32.937 --> 47:34.220
Step aside, please.

47:35.247 --> 47:36.666
Suit yourself.

47:45.400 --> 47:46.952
He drained the blood.

47:47.072 --> 47:48.316
He's neat.

47:48.704 --> 47:50.976
We dealing with a doctor?

47:53.460 --> 47:55.173
Maybe.

47:57.202 --> 47:58.595
Where's her purse?

47:58.633 --> 47:59.728
Driver's seat.

47:59.848 --> 48:02.324
Ah.

48:02.874 --> 48:04.201
Everything's there.

48:04.257 --> 48:06.422
Cash, credit cards, what have you.

48:06.703 --> 48:08.180
Did it all by the book.

48:09.381 --> 48:11.881
- Did you pull her I.D.?
- No, ma'am.

48:12.572 --> 48:13.992
Then it's missing.

48:15.913 --> 48:17.890
Maybe that is his trophy.

48:22.752 --> 48:24.717
Did Cristina have her I.D.?

48:25.743 --> 48:27.057
I don't remember.

48:29.253 --> 48:30.786
Well, her parents would know.

48:30.842 --> 48:32.831
We'll go to Juarez, ask them.

48:32.951 --> 48:34.871
I don't think that's a good idea.

48:34.991 --> 48:36.179
Why?

48:36.667 --> 48:38.638
Oh, you want to put up your hoodie,

48:38.707 --> 48:40.227
tug back your hair?

48:40.909 --> 48:42.485
Uh, I'm not taking you to Juarez.

48:42.905 --> 48:44.306
Forget about it.

48:48.319 --> 48:50.938
Would you like to write up the scene?

48:52.734 --> 48:53.754
Go ahead.

50:10.012 --> 50:11.764
Judge Gates.

50:12.115 --> 50:14.767
Boy, she needed bent-over-a-couch, bad.

50:14.805 --> 50:16.790
Yeah, well, she got worse.

50:17.107 --> 50:19.179
Half of her is in the pecos morgue.

50:19.854 --> 50:21.875
And the Mexicans want in on this?

50:21.919 --> 50:24.365
Their half is one of
the missing Juarez girls.

50:26.241 --> 50:29.413
Well, putting up them pink
crosses sure as shit ain't working.

50:30.420 --> 50:32.935
This fella know about Sonya?

50:34.009 --> 50:35.709
Know what?

50:36.076 --> 50:38.410
That she's a bona fide whack job?

50:38.773 --> 50:40.142
Have you seen what she keeps

50:40.155 --> 50:41.813
in in the bottom drawer of that desk?

50:42.044 --> 50:43.784
No I have not, Timmy.

50:44.053 --> 50:45.004
Nor do I care.

50:45.047 --> 50:48.119
Oh, Hank, listen, if
you've seen it, then...

50:50.234 --> 50:52.242
Marco Ruiz, Tim Cooper.

50:53.030 --> 50:54.661
Well, buenas dias.

50:54.663 --> 50:56.265
Howdy, partner.

50:56.385 --> 50:57.929
You have the footage of the bridge?

50:57.967 --> 51:00.376
I do. Went a few rounds with those homeland

51:00.407 --> 51:02.310
security jag-offs, but I got it.

51:02.785 --> 51:04.656
Sonya, can I talk to you a second?

51:08.115 --> 51:09.879
And it looks like you're stuck with me,

51:09.917 --> 51:11.786
- Detective Ruiz.
- That's okay.

51:13.407 --> 51:14.990
Have a seat.

51:18.900 --> 51:20.452
What is this?

51:21.128 --> 51:22.273
Oh, um,

51:22.393 --> 51:24.993
I filed a report on Marco
with the Mexican state police.

51:25.012 --> 51:26.062
Yeah, I see that.

51:26.770 --> 51:28.103
He compromised the scene.

51:28.128 --> 51:29.692
He let an ambulance drive through it.

51:29.812 --> 51:32.026
Because a man was having a heart attack.

51:32.095 --> 51:32.965
Yes.

51:34.692 --> 51:36.943
Sonya, I would have done the same thing.

51:37.281 --> 51:39.033
Absolutely the same thing.

51:39.045 --> 51:40.707
No evidence was lost.

51:42.530 --> 51:43.877
How do you know?

51:45.739 --> 51:48.605
Look, Sonya, you're gonna have
to work with Detective Ruiz.

51:49.218 --> 51:50.319
I know.

51:50.356 --> 51:51.458
Well, filing that report

51:51.477 --> 51:53.328
is gonna effect your ability to do that.

51:54.056 --> 51:55.186
Why?

51:56.144 --> 51:58.052
Because people don't like to be ratted out

51:58.065 --> 51:59.793
to their bosses, that's why.

52:00.073 --> 52:01.975
Then they should follow procedure.

52:05.404 --> 52:07.455
You're gonna have to learn to get along

52:07.524 --> 52:08.650
without me.

52:09.751 --> 52:11.972
I can't be sweeping up after you forever.

52:14.029 --> 52:15.213
What do you mean?

52:15.244 --> 52:17.847
Well, there's a gal up
in Gainesville asked me to

52:17.866 --> 52:19.387
show a couple of horses for her, and

52:19.393 --> 52:20.413
I think I'm gonna do it.

52:20.463 --> 52:21.989
And Carmen wants to travel.

52:22.003 --> 52:23.203
She wants to go to Paris.

52:23.205 --> 52:24.386
I don't want to go to France.

52:24.417 --> 52:25.706
I'd go to England in a heartbeat.

52:25.737 --> 52:27.602
I'd like to see their
big old clock they got.

52:28.259 --> 52:29.404
Wait, I...

52:30.612 --> 52:31.950
you're gonna retire?

52:33.127 --> 52:34.459
Well...

52:35.222 --> 52:37.262
yeah, I can't do this forever.

52:48.393 --> 52:49.632
What about me?

52:50.883 --> 52:52.478
You'll be all right.

52:54.449 --> 52:55.932
You'll be all right.

52:57.658 --> 53:00.869
I j... I just asked for
the paperwork, that's all.

53:04.060 --> 53:06.906
We got something.

53:11.642 --> 53:13.081
What do we got?

53:15.102 --> 53:17.655
Son of a bitch knew there were cameras.

53:18.600 --> 53:20.001
Sure it's him?

53:20.121 --> 53:21.747
Timing is spot-on.

53:21.784 --> 53:25.011
- So did you run the plate?
- Yes, sir.

53:29.009 --> 53:30.679
That's Daniel Frye.

53:31.211 --> 53:33.176
What, you know him? Who's that?

53:33.476 --> 53:34.946
Dick-wad reporter.

53:35.066 --> 53:36.916
El Paso Times.

53:58.277 --> 54:00.060
I thought you were across the border.

54:00.398 --> 54:01.662
Just got back.

54:01.887 --> 54:04.308
You're wasting your life on
that beat. You know that, right?

54:05.634 --> 54:07.354
I'm wasting my life, huh?

54:08.042 --> 54:10.213
Some Mexican shot

54:10.239 --> 54:12.772
another Mexican? Weird.

54:12.797 --> 54:13.735
No.

54:13.741 --> 54:16.494
I was meeting a woman who helps
pregnant girls over the border.

54:16.557 --> 54:18.716
It's for my piece on anchor
babies, you know, like the...

54:18.747 --> 54:20.468
I don't know, and I deeply don't care.

54:20.493 --> 54:23.308
And guess what, neither do the 15
other people that read this rag.

54:25.361 --> 54:26.605
Well, I care.

54:26.725 --> 54:28.162
That's great.

54:28.164 --> 54:29.916
Sherry is looking for you.

54:29.922 --> 54:30.829
You have a deadline.

54:30.854 --> 54:32.149
Sherry can eat me.

54:32.143 --> 54:33.307
Piece is on her desk.

54:33.338 --> 54:34.352
Where were you?

54:34.970 --> 54:37.036
Down the street, reporting.

54:37.540 --> 54:39.326
Drinking, you mean?

54:40.659 --> 54:42.486
Are you my mother, Adriana?

54:43.813 --> 54:44.700
No.

54:44.744 --> 54:47.797
Oh, that's right. You're
just a little cub reporter.

54:47.822 --> 54:50.199
Let's see, I've written
for the New York Post,

54:50.206 --> 54:51.515
- the Houston Chronicle...
- I know.

54:51.635 --> 54:53.454
So don't tell me how to
deal with a goddamn editor.

54:53.511 --> 54:54.574
Got it?

54:55.619 --> 54:56.558
Fine.

54:57.897 --> 54:59.642
Good luck with your Mexican baby story.

54:59.667 --> 55:01.357
Sounds fascinating.

55:44.606 --> 55:46.534
Oh, come on.

55:53.985 --> 55:55.405
What the hell...?

56:06.785 --> 56:08.580
Oh, shit.

56:35.291 --> 56:37.481
Daniel Frye's not answering.

56:37.601 --> 56:39.001
What's his story?

56:39.121 --> 56:40.978
Pill-head... he's been
arrested for battery.

56:41.098 --> 56:43.893
He organized enough to
freeze a girl for a year

56:43.924 --> 56:45.608
and slice a judge in half?

56:45.639 --> 56:47.141
Well, it was his car on the bridge.

56:47.436 --> 56:48.468
What's going on?

56:48.717 --> 56:50.481
We have a car rigged with a bomb.

56:50.601 --> 56:52.204
- A black BMW?
- Affirmative.

56:52.248 --> 56:53.574
- Bomb squad's got it under control.
- Excuse me.

56:53.586 --> 56:54.838
Excuse us, man.

56:55.444 --> 56:56.633
Officer!

56:57.528 --> 56:59.155
Ma'am, fall back please.

56:59.275 --> 57:01.182
The car belongs to Daniel Frye.

57:01.220 --> 57:02.934
He's wanted in connection
with a double homicide.

57:03.003 --> 57:03.898
He's the one who called it in.

57:03.929 --> 57:04.711
He's trapped in there.

57:04.699 --> 57:06.038
- I need to speak...
- Ma'am, please.

57:06.158 --> 57:07.202
This is as far as you go.

57:07.233 --> 57:08.197
Call him again.

57:08.572 --> 57:10.218
Just... call him again.

57:24.640 --> 57:26.466
Hey... hey!

57:26.535 --> 57:27.824
The bomb is in the ba...

57:27.811 --> 57:28.912
It's... it's in the back seat.

57:28.962 --> 57:30.626
- It's ticking. It's going.
- Stay calm!

57:30.628 --> 57:31.761
Stay calm.

57:31.972 --> 57:33.150
Okay, but i... it's got...

57:33.140 --> 57:34.758
you gotta go. It start...

57:34.751 --> 57:36.072
it won't stop.

57:36.192 --> 57:38.530
It's very important that you don't move.

57:38.893 --> 57:40.426
I'm not gonna move.

57:41.346 --> 57:43.067
Just... hurry.

57:45.638 --> 57:47.084
Windows wired in.

57:47.134 --> 57:49.311
Possible motion control activation.

57:49.336 --> 57:51.495
Let's get the borescope
in there and take a look.

57:52.496 --> 57:53.810
Oh, my God.

57:54.686 --> 57:57.815
Just go faster! Just a
little faster, please!

58:03.589 --> 58:05.742
Daniel.

58:05.761 --> 58:07.494
Just please help me get out of the car.

58:07.553 --> 58:08.990
Detective Sonya Cross.

58:08.996 --> 58:10.742
Were you on the bridge of
the americas last night?

58:10.792 --> 58:12.181
What? What?

58:12.213 --> 58:14.345
Were you on the bridge, yes or no?

58:14.382 --> 58:16.015
Uh, no, I was here all day.

58:16.015 --> 58:16.497
I don't know...

58:16.522 --> 58:18.155
I'm not sure how that's gonna
help me get out of the car.

58:18.212 --> 58:19.794
Do you know Judge Gates?

58:20.001 --> 58:22.159
Uh... uh, who?

58:22.279 --> 58:23.986
Judge Lorraine Gates.

58:24.030 --> 58:25.988
Just... just... just from, like, uh...

58:26.019 --> 58:28.215
just from, like, cases and stuff.

58:28.240 --> 58:29.410
What cases?

58:29.635 --> 58:30.300
Oh, my God.

58:30.350 --> 58:31.551
It doesn't matter what cases.

58:31.570 --> 58:32.834
Just... please, you got to...

58:32.846 --> 58:35.418
you have to tell them that the... the t...

58:35.462 --> 58:37.627
the ticker, it just keeps going.

58:38.072 --> 58:39.748
Yeah, yeah, yeah, put that thing in...

58:39.779 --> 58:42.457
put... put, put it in.

58:43.727 --> 58:46.023
So, y... yeah.

58:47.337 --> 58:49.322
Oh... oh, my God.

58:50.122 --> 58:52.074
How about Cristina Fuentes?

58:54.145 --> 58:56.266
I am so screwed.

58:59.502 --> 59:01.241
Daniel, this is important.

59:01.361 --> 59:03.496
Important? I'm about
to get my ass blown up.

59:03.508 --> 59:05.742
Can you please stop asking
me questions about a judge?

59:05.779 --> 59:06.349
Thank you.

59:06.380 --> 59:08.457
Have you written about Judge Gates?

59:08.713 --> 59:09.965
Um, oh, my God.

59:10.085 --> 59:12.192
Um, yes, at some point
I'm sure I have, but...

59:12.192 --> 59:13.037
When?

59:13.055 --> 59:15.658
Stop asking me questions
and please just help them!

59:15.696 --> 59:17.679
You got to get me out of this car.

59:20.288 --> 59:22.766
Um... the, uh... the ti... the

59:22.772 --> 59:24.518
timer just jumped a minute.

59:24.568 --> 59:26.809
- Hey. Hey, the... the timer just...
- Abort.

59:26.878 --> 59:28.480
The timer just jumped a minute.

59:28.518 --> 59:29.819
- Fall back.
- No, no, no, no!

59:29.856 --> 59:31.640
Don't... wait, wait, wait. Bring it back!

59:31.671 --> 59:33.010
Wait, wait. Excuse...

59:33.067 --> 59:34.299
y... y... don't leave me.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.288
Wait, you have... you
have to tell them that I...

59:36.320 --> 59:37.465
that there's still time.

59:37.585 --> 59:38.791
No, no, no, no, hey!

59:38.803 --> 59:42.202
Hey, you tell them to come
back here right goddamn now!

59:43.853 --> 59:45.249
He's sitting on a bomb.

59:45.255 --> 59:47.027
- No one can help him.
- So he'll tell me the truth.

59:47.045 --> 59:48.816
Daniel, you must speak to me.

59:48.936 --> 59:50.036
There's still time.

59:50.156 --> 59:51.150
There's still...

59:52.426 --> 59:53.352
Do you hear me?

59:53.364 --> 59:55.060
You must talk to me.

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:01.592
Yes?

01:00:01.712 --> 01:00:03.332
Everything will just stop.

01:00:05.509 --> 01:00:07.148
The body will feel no pain.

01:00:10.633 --> 01:00:12.022
Are you sure?

01:00:13.111 --> 01:00:15.026
Don't look at the clock.

01:00:18.886 --> 01:00:21.670
Do you know your car was used
to dump two bodies on the bridge?

01:00:22.677 --> 01:00:23.854
No.

01:00:23.892 --> 01:00:25.237
I need you to focus.

01:00:25.994 --> 01:00:27.483
Who would do this to you?

01:00:27.603 --> 01:00:28.390
I've screwed...

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.411
I've screwed over so many people.

01:00:30.749 --> 01:00:32.406
When? Recently?

01:00:34.108 --> 01:00:36.730
I'm not ready to die.

01:00:37.392 --> 01:00:38.926
I'm just...

01:00:39.158 --> 01:00:41.028
I'm just not ready to die.

01:00:41.148 --> 01:00:43.568
Don't look at the timer.

01:00:46.158 --> 01:00:47.923
Okay.

01:00:59.354 --> 01:01:01.512
- That's it!
- Cover up! Fall down!

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:38.117
- Frye's?
- No, ma'am.

01:01:38.119 --> 01:01:39.585
It was rigged into the bomb.

01:01:39.587 --> 01:01:40.966
There's a message.

01:01:51.501 --> 01:01:54.992
There are five murders a year in El Paso.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:57.464
In Juarez, thousands.

01:01:57.639 --> 01:01:58.934
Why?

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:02.507
Why is one dead white woman more important

01:02:02.701 --> 01:02:06.010
than so many dead just across the bridge?

01:02:06.317 --> 01:02:09.377
How long can El Paso look away?

01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:14.057
We've got some interesting times ahead.

01:02:14.782 --> 01:02:17.817
This is only the beginning.
