09:01.124 --> 09:02.334
- Bye!

09:02.376 --> 09:03.918
- Bye.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.918
- See you later.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.256
I'll see your

09:05.379 --> 09:08.256
two Flintstone stickers

09:08.298 --> 09:10.800
and raise you

09:08.298 --> 09:10.800
three Hello Kitty's.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.261
I call.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.973
Seven queens. Beat that.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.641
Seven aces.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.395
Bingo!

09:25.357 --> 09:26.733
- No way.

09:25.357 --> 09:26.733
- Really!

09:26.774 --> 09:27.817
No way!

09:27.859 --> 09:29.277
I swear my dad was alive

09:29.319 --> 09:31.530
when Neil Armstrong

09:29.319 --> 09:31.530
walked on the moon.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.033
No way. It's in

09:32.739 --> 09:35.033
our history book.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.659
He said.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.413
Amazing.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.413
Well, I got to get home.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.206
So, I'll see you

09:39.454 --> 09:41.206
at lunch tomorrow?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.666
- I can't.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.666
- Why not?

09:43.708 --> 09:46.044
I promised Kathy Santoni,

09:43.708 --> 09:46.044
I'd sit with her tomorrow.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.505
Kathy Santoni?

09:48.547 --> 09:50.090
You can't eat lunch

09:48.547 --> 09:50.090
with Kathy Santoni.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.884
Everybody will say you're

09:50.131 --> 09:52.884
boyfriend-girlfriend.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.469
Maybe.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.682
But I thought we were

09:56.471 --> 09:59.682
boyfriend-girlfriend.

09:59.724 --> 10:03.270
Yeah, well, you're real

09:59.724 --> 10:03.270
nice and fun and smart..

10:03.311 --> 10:07.148
...but Kathy Santoni

10:03.311 --> 10:07.148
is...so pretty.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.821
Thanks for helping me

10:10.693 --> 10:13.821
with my homework.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.574
I gotta go.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.259
Hi, D.J. How come

10:31.047 --> 10:34.259
your boyfriend left so soon?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.471
I don't have a boyfriend.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.556
Uh-oh.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.141
Did he dump you?

10:42.559 --> 10:44.311
We broke up.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.771
Just forget it.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.771
I want to be alone.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.984
Here's your sleeping bag.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.236
Your pajamas

10:51.025 --> 10:53.236
and your pillow.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.321
Go sleep with Michelle.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.824
But-but-but..

10:57.865 --> 11:00.201
Aren't you

10:57.865 --> 11:00.201
forgetting something?

11:04.289 --> 11:06.207
How rude.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.128
[instrumental music]

11:14.549 --> 11:18.011
Number 12. I'll remember that.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.097
W-w-whoa! Whoa!

11:21.139 --> 11:23.141
I'll remember that.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.102
You see that? That woman

11:23.183 --> 11:26.102
pinched me like a ripe tomato.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.770
At least she noticed you.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.940
I feel like I'm back in

11:27.812 --> 11:30.940
high school. Nobody wants me.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.401
[sighs]

11:30.982 --> 11:33.401
I'm going to be

11:30.982 --> 11:33.401
totally humiliated.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.819
I'll probably get a zit.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.825
Come on, this is fun.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.825
Now we know how women feel.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.661
Let's go to

11:40.867 --> 11:42.661
the bathroom together.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.289
Hi, guys. Having a good time?

11:46.331 --> 11:48.208
Oh,<i> Tres festive.</i>

11:48.249 --> 11:50.210
Is there any way

11:48.249 --> 11:50.210
I can get out of this fiasco?

11:50.251 --> 11:53.963
Hi, I'm Crystal.

11:50.251 --> 11:53.963
Are you one of our bachelors?

11:54.005 --> 11:57.342
Hi. Yes, I am.

11:54.005 --> 11:57.342
Uh, tomato number 12.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.970
I took the liberty

11:58.759 --> 12:00.970
of buying you some champagne.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.681
Thank you.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.559
A, uh, toast to charity.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.768
He's a true humanitarian.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.944
Hey.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.114
Hi, Michelle.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.701
You got a roommate.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.701
Isn't that fun?

12:22.741 --> 12:26.246
Shh! Stephanie night-night.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.251
I'll try

12:29.457 --> 12:31.251
and keep it down.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.092
Wake up.

Sold for $300.

12:47.559 --> 12:48.976
Well, congratulations, Jeff.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.769
something, this wonderful

12:50.811 --> 12:53.940
would happen to you

12:50.811 --> 12:53.940

Ladies, I don't think you

13:22.927 --> 13:25.846
understand what we have here.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.807
This man is a comic,

Hi, handsome.

13:58.837 --> 14:02.049
Hi, I guess I'm your date.

13:58.837 --> 14:02.049
Nice bird.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.968
Oh, you're not for me, honey.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.095
You're a little gift

14:16.063 --> 14:17.982
And that brings us

14:16.063 --> 14:17.982
to bachelor number 12.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.900
Uh, wait a minute.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.028
It seems that Danny has

14:19.942 --> 14:22.028
conveniently forgotten

14:22.069 --> 14:24.447
that he's bachelor number 11.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.367
Ladies, Mr. Danny Tanner.

He's turning red

14:33.247 --> 14:36.250
before our eyes.

Here you go.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.170
Go get 'em, tiger.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.549
Uh..

14:42.590 --> 14:46.469
Alright, now remember,

14:42.590 --> 14:46.469
this is for a very good cause.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.179
Oh, uh..

Uh, now, our date

14:48.221 --> 14:50.056

Don't stop now, ladies,

15:10.284 --> 15:12.412
I can go all night.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.169
No, I think you

15:17.458 --> 15:20.169
misunderstood me.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.380
What I meant was, uh..

15:22.422 --> 15:27.301
...sold for $150 to the lady

15:22.422 --> 15:27.301
with the bird on her hat.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.557
Do you have

15:31.347 --> 15:32.557
another granddaughter?

15:32.599 --> 15:35.810
Oh, no, sweetie.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.810
You're for me.

15:38.229 --> 15:41.608
We're gonna boogie

15:38.229 --> 15:41.608

Would you just get on

15:58.917 --> 16:02.378
with the bidding?

16:02.420 --> 16:04.881
Right. Do I have $100?

16:07.133 --> 16:10.261
[chuckles]

16:07.133 --> 16:10.261
Stupid question. Uh, 200?

Three hundred?

16:13.306 --> 16:16.517
I bid $1000.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.022
What do you think

16:20.688 --> 16:22.022

A thousand dollars

16:22.064 --> 16:24.484

16:48.925 --> 16:51.469
Anybody?

16:51.511 --> 16:54.681
Take him. I could never explain

16:51.511 --> 16:54.681
$1800 to my husband.

16:56.683 --> 17:00.687
Sold to Rebecca Donaldson

16:56.683 --> 17:00.687
for $1700.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.985
I can't believe

17:05.441 --> 17:06.985
Joey just did that.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.446
Hey, all you guys get sold?

17:10.488 --> 17:13.240
Nick, I got a great girl.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.952
I got her grandmother.

17:15.994 --> 17:19.079
Well, I got Becky.

17:15.994 --> 17:19.079
Pop, she paid 1700 bucks for me.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.498
What are you, nuts?

17:20.540 --> 17:23.751
- Hey, that's what I said.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.751
- Stifle..

17:23.793 --> 17:26.504
Well, it was

17:23.793 --> 17:26.504
for a good cause and I..

17:26.546 --> 17:28.548
So, Nick, how are the kids?

17:28.589 --> 17:30.800
Well, Stephanie had

17:28.589 --> 17:30.800
to sleep with Michelle

17:30.842 --> 17:32.593
because D.J. wanted to be alone.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.428
Her boyfriend broke up with her.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.015
- Oh, no.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.015
- She must be crushed.

Her first broken heart.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.812
[sighs]

17:39.976 --> 17:42.812
This sounds like

17:39.976 --> 17:42.812
a job for dad.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.525
What should dad say?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.109
You better take

17:47.567 --> 17:49.109
along junior dads.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.778
Junior dad time.

17:54.699 --> 17:58.452
You paid 1700 bucks

17:54.699 --> 17:58.452
for Jesse, huh?

17:58.494 --> 18:00.038
I don't know

17:58.494 --> 18:00.038
if you're aware of this

18:00.079 --> 18:02.248
but you could've

18:00.079 --> 18:02.248
had him for free.

'Hi.'

18:12.550 --> 18:14.761
We heard what happened.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.512
Did you have a fight?

18:16.554 --> 18:19.057
No. It's all because

18:16.554 --> 18:19.057
I'm not pretty.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.683
- Oh.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.683
- Come on.

18:28.816 --> 18:32.528
the story of The Ugly Duckling?

18:32.570 --> 18:34.196
Right, good story.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.364
Yeah, tell her

18:34.238 --> 18:35.364
The Ugly Duckling story.

18:35.406 --> 18:38.785
Ugly? You guys

18:35.406 --> 18:38.785

18:38.826 --> 18:41.662
I just thought

18:38.826 --> 18:41.662
I wasn't pretty, now I'm ugly.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.706
- Deej.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.706
- 'D.J.'

18:47.334 --> 18:48.502
We don't think

18:47.334 --> 18:48.502
you're ugly.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.463
Yeah. It's the<i> duck</i>

18:48.544 --> 18:50.463
that's ugly.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.382
And the duck turns

18:50.504 --> 18:53.382
into a beautiful swan.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.051
I don't believe it.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.637
You guys told her

18:55.093 --> 18:57.637
the story of The Ugly Duckling?

18:57.678 --> 18:58.846
Yeah.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.098
You never tell that story

19:00.139 --> 19:03.350

19:00.139 --> 19:03.350
some other kid.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.936
Would you try talking to her?

19:04.978 --> 19:07.146
Maybe D.J. needs

19:04.978 --> 19:07.146
a woman to talk to.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.316
We should have told her

19:08.606 --> 19:10.316
Hansel and Gretel.

wanna come out so we can talk?

19:50.481 --> 19:52.108
Becky, there's nothing

19:50.481 --> 19:52.108
to talk about.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.944
I'm ugly, boys don't

19:52.150 --> 19:54.944

19:54.986 --> 19:56.904
D.J., that's not true.

19:56.946 --> 20:00.574
You happen to be

19:56.946 --> 20:00.574
a very pretty girl.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.242
But I know how you feel.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.078
When I was

20:02.284 --> 20:04.078
in the seventh grade

20:04.120 --> 20:07.206
I had the biggest crush

20:04.120 --> 20:07.206
on Sven Anderson.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.458
[clicks tongue]

20:07.247 --> 20:09.458
But he liked blonds.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.628
So I got

20:09.500 --> 20:12.628
a big bottle of peroxide.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.838
Did it work?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.506
[scoffs]

20:13.880 --> 20:15.506

20:15.548 --> 20:17.800

20:15.548 --> 20:17.800
in a miniskirt.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.096
Howdy who?

20:22.138 --> 20:24.974
Anyway, my mother said

20:25.016 --> 20:27.226
"Don't you worry

20:25.016 --> 20:27.226
about what a boyfriend

20:27.267 --> 20:29.770
"or anybody else

You just be the best

20:29.812 --> 20:32.481
Becky you can be."

20:32.523 --> 20:35.484
Then she made me stand there

20:32.523 --> 20:35.484
and list all my good points.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.113
You're not gonna

20:36.819 --> 20:39.113
make me do that, are you?

20:39.155 --> 20:40.865
Yes, I am.

You're welcome.

Do you think I'll ever

21:16.901 --> 21:18.694
have another boyfriend?

21:18.736 --> 21:21.655
Oh, you'll have

21:18.736 --> 21:21.655
lots of boyfriends.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.490
And some will break your heart

21:23.532 --> 21:24.867
and if I'm not mistaken

21:24.909 --> 21:26.994
you'll probably break

a few hearts yourself.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.663
It'll be great.
