00:34.833 --> 00:36.389
Now...

00:36.429 --> 00:41.169
if you buy a G-Wiz,

00:41.209 --> 00:45.373
plainly you are not interested
in style or comfort or speed

00:45.413 --> 00:50.389
or practicality or driving pleasure
- or safety or your dignity.

00:50.429 --> 00:52.889
LAUGHTER

00:52.929 --> 00:57.921
And that got us thinking. If all
you want is a battery-powered box,

00:57.961 --> 01:01.169
why spend Â£8,500 on one of these?

01:01.209 --> 01:08.281
Why not simply build one yourself?
I mean, how hard can it be?

01:08.321 --> 01:14.965
Keen to get cracking, we went to the Top
Gear Technology Centre and set to work.

01:15.005 --> 01:17.109
It's all very simple, really.

01:17.149 --> 01:19.717
I am in charge of the batteries
and the electric motor.

01:19.757 --> 01:23.641
Clarkson is in charge - God help
us - of the bodywork and interior,

01:23.681 --> 01:28.061
and Richard Hammond is in charge
of the chassis and the brakes.

01:28.101 --> 01:32.341
If you are going to build your owncar, there's no
point just throwing the chassis together yourself

01:32.381 --> 01:36.609
cos you'll get caught up in 20 years
- of red tape trying to get it registered to use on the road,

01:36.649 --> 01:40.593
so what you need to do is use
the chassis from another car.

01:40.633 --> 01:44.213
But there is a problem, because most
modern cars don't have a chassis as such.

01:44.253 --> 01:48.733
It's all kind of built into the body,
so you need to choose from an older car.

01:48.773 --> 01:52.517
Specifically, you've got a choice of
either a Land Rover, a Lincoln Town Car,

01:52.557 --> 01:57.217
or this, a TVR Chimaera.

01:57.257 --> 02:01.797
I bought this one for Â£5,000, and I
was going to remove its body and engine

02:01.837 --> 02:07.873
and then use its chassis as
the backbone of our new car.

02:07.913 --> 02:14.685
James, meanwhile, was preparing to
cannibalise something a bit less sporty.

02:14.725 --> 02:20.157
I shall be using the electric motor
- from this, which just leaves me with the problem of the batteries.

02:20.197 --> 02:23.157
Now, the Tesla - that
American electric sports car -

02:23.197 --> 02:27.189
uses 6,831 batteries,

02:27.229 --> 02:29.749
but that seems a bit excessive
to me, so to save weight,

02:29.789 --> 02:36.893
and money, I'm going
to use two batteries.

02:36.933 --> 02:41.141
Like all great car designers,
I'd created a mood room,

02:41.181 --> 02:45.857
hung with images from which
I could draw inspiration.

02:45.897 --> 02:51.517
Big cats, jet fighters,
the actor Peter Bowles,

02:51.557 --> 03:00.237
and pretty soon, I was
ready to start work.

03:00.277 --> 03:04.701
It's a lovely material to work
with, aluminium, because it bends.

03:04.741 --> 03:08.501
Car makers could learn a lot from
this simple system I've adopted.

03:08.541 --> 03:11.765
Ow! BLEEP! Ow!

03:11.805 --> 03:14.733
And there is the precious chassis.

03:14.773 --> 03:23.705
That is the basisof everything
we're doing. A doddle!

03:23.745 --> 03:28.081
In terms of construction, I've
taken my lead from shelving.

03:28.121 --> 03:31.373
You've simply got the
uprights, which I've got here.

03:31.413 --> 03:34.125
There it is.

03:34.165 --> 03:36.533
The bolt goes through there.

03:36.573 --> 03:38.453
Damn it!

03:38.493 --> 03:40.373
How simple is this?

03:40.413 --> 03:44.893
One piece, another piece,
bolts holding them together.

03:44.933 --> 03:49.521
With the milk float dismembered,
my power system was taking shape.

03:49.561 --> 03:53.937
That's 100 quid's worth of
batteries, a 20 quid milk float motor,

03:53.977 --> 03:56.705
and watch this. MOTOR WHIRRS

03:56.745 --> 03:59.173

03:59.213 --> 04:02.425
Is that turning round now? Don't put
your finger on it. I'm not going to.

04:02.465 --> 04:05.173
As long as you two keep the weight
of your body and chassis down,

04:05.213 --> 04:08.677
that'll go like a
stabbed rat. Are you sure?

04:08.717 --> 04:13.205
Well, it'll be a damn
sight faster than a G-Wiz.

04:13.245 --> 04:20.725

Hammond prepared his chassis...' It's free!

04:20.765 --> 04:27.173
'..I retired to the mood room to
seek further design inspiration.'

04:33.109 --> 04:41.053
Has anyone ever done a car
with a moustache? No. No.

04:41.093 --> 04:48.005
Having finished their jobs, Hammond and
May left me alone to complete the bodywork.

04:48.045 --> 04:56.893
Beautiful.

04:56.933 --> 05:00.457
Our masterpiece was ready.

05:00.497 --> 05:06.021

any of the nail heads. I mean, it's all right.

Please tell me that... ENGINE STOPS

13:55.249 --> 13:57.365
You bloody idiot!

13:57.405 --> 14:00.457
Why did you think two batteries
was the right solution?

14:00.497 --> 14:05.253
Tesla used 6,800 batteries for a reason.

14:05.293 --> 14:09.613
Oh, great(!) We're actually holding
people up here. Sorry. Sorry!

14:09.653 --> 14:12.681
THEY STRAIN Come on, Geoff.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.681
Come on! I'll tell you what, James.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.817
What? There's loads of houses
around here where we can get

14:17.857 --> 14:22.885
some more electricity(!) James, seriously, why
didn't you put more than two batteries in it?

14:22.925 --> 14:27.613
I didn't want it to weigh too much.
- Batteries go flat. This is important consumer information.

14:27.653 --> 14:30.725
Stored electricity is
like a caged animal.

14:30.765 --> 14:35.365
You should have used more than two.
- Well, next time, I know and we know.

14:35.405 --> 14:39.869
Tell me that isn't happening.
Tell me that isn't happening.

14:39.909 --> 14:43.661
CRASH!

14:43.701 --> 14:47.117
I... I don't want to...

14:47.157 --> 14:51.041
The lonely walk
confirmed our worst fears.

14:51.081 --> 14:58.273
Geoff was dead.

14:58.313 --> 15:02.725
Don't applaud. Don't
applaud. Geoff is dead!

15:02.765 --> 15:07.557
It was the saddest moment. As
it hit the tree, my heart broke.

15:07.597 --> 15:10.917
They're obviously all from
Oxford, that's what it is.

15:10.957 --> 15:13.257
Yeah.

15:13.297 --> 15:16.165
Anyway, we could have given up
at that point, but we didn't.

15:16.205 --> 15:18.897
We went back to the drawing board
and later on you'll be able to see

15:18.937 --> 15:23.213
the results of our frankly brilliant
effort. But for now, it's the news.

15:23.253 --> 15:26.293
It is indeed and we start with this.

15:26.333 --> 15:30.729
As we know, Formula One has always
been the most glamorous sport

15:30.769 --> 15:34.257
in the world, hasn't it? Yeah? But
not any more. Not from next year.

15:34.297 --> 15:37.841
There's four new teams joining in,
OK. One of them, Manor Grand Prix,

15:37.881 --> 15:42.309
is based in Sheffield.
How glamorous is that?

15:42.349 --> 15:45.325
Strictly speaking, it's actually
between Sheffield and Rotherham.

15:45.365 --> 15:49.461
If we're going to be pedantic, it's
between Sheffield, Rotherham and Worksop,

15:49.501 --> 15:51.977
in a place called
Dinnington, which I know well.

15:52.017 --> 15:57.025
And it's exactly like Monte
Carlo...apart from in every single detail.

15:57.065 --> 16:00.541
It does take the shine of it a bit.
I can't wait to see their new car.

16:00.581 --> 16:04.053
I don't why you bother with all that
carbon fibre, I made mine out of steel.

16:04.093 --> 16:08.057
Stainless steel. If that
Fernando Alonso hits our car,

16:08.097 --> 16:12.165
his Ferrari will be knackered.
I'll tell you that for nowt.

16:12.205 --> 16:16.309
It's funny, me dad worked in pit and
now I've got a job in pit and all.

16:16.349 --> 16:21.729
They're replacing Toyota and
they've signed Timo Glock,

16:21.769 --> 16:24.433
who presumably is currently learning
why it's important to punch anyone

16:24.473 --> 16:26.869
who looks at him funny.

16:26.909 --> 16:30.869
Is anyone from Sheffield?
Yeah. Are you? Whereabouts?

16:30.909 --> 16:34.213
You're from Sheffield?
Cos I'm just thinking,

16:34.253 --> 16:38.405
they're using Cosworth engines,
or I should say, Sheffield, Cozza.

16:38.445 --> 16:42.733
Cosa? No, Coz-za. You've got to have-
a stroke halfway through the word.

16:42.773 --> 16:47.293
Coz-za. So your face falls.
Coz-za.- Coz-za. Your face falls off.

16:47.333 --> 16:50.793
You're from Sheffield, just
practise it, just show us.

16:50.833 --> 16:53.125
How do you say it? Cozza.

16:53.165 --> 16:54.717
There you go!

16:54.757 --> 16:57.213
I think it's fair to say that
that team is probably Top Gear's

16:57.253 --> 17:00.105
absolute favourite F1 team.
I want them to win everything,

17:00.145 --> 17:02.997
so on the podium they're gonna
have a big brass band at the end.

17:03.037 --> 17:09.261
Abide With Me. Ain't that a national anthem? We'll
have Abide With Me on a brass band, be lovely.

17:09.300 --> 17:13.717
Now, criminals, would you like
to get away with your crimes?

17:13.757 --> 17:17.492
Are you capable of running
more than 100 yards?

17:17.532 --> 17:22.453
Well, good news, because the police
- are thinking of using these now.

17:22.492 --> 17:25.560
It's a Mitsubishi electric.

17:25.601 --> 17:30.309
They say it's helping
them crack down on CO2.

17:30.349 --> 17:33.933
I don't want the police
to crack down on CO2.

17:33.973 --> 17:36.341
I want them to get my
bloody television back,

17:36.381 --> 17:38.981
because it's been six
years since that was nicked,

17:39.021 --> 17:42.653
and I haven't heard a peep out of them whilst
they've been going on about cracking down on CO2.

17:42.693 --> 17:45.405
I'll have to buy
another one at this rate.

17:45.445 --> 17:48.417
What were you stopped for
the other day, by a policeman?

17:48.457 --> 17:50.857
It was some motoring misdemeanour.
You just turned around and said,

17:50.897 --> 17:55.417
"Oh, good. This must mean
you've found my television."

17:55.457 --> 17:59.261
If I was a policeman and my chief
freemason came into the office

17:59.301 --> 18:04.969
and said... I mean Chief Constable.
- I always get them muddled up.

18:05.009 --> 18:08.421
And he said, "Right, you've got
to do your beat in one of those."

18:08.461 --> 18:10.721
I would drink my own pepper spray.

18:10.761 --> 18:14.565
I'll tell you what, this is a
slightly interesting one, OK.

18:14.605 --> 18:18.749
There was a survey recently
about the effects that a nice car

18:18.789 --> 18:23.029
can have on a male, the human male, OK?

18:23.069 --> 18:26.217
What they did was they got 40 young
- guys and they made them drive

18:26.257 --> 18:28.813
up and down the street in a Toyota
Camry and then drive up and down

18:28.853 --> 18:31.877
the same street, in the
same manner, in a Porsche 911

18:31.917 --> 18:34.905
and then they measured their
testosterone after each drive.

18:34.945 --> 18:38.313
And after driving the
Porsche, it had shot up.

18:38.353 --> 18:40.877
So it had an actual physiological
effect on them? Yeah.

18:40.917 --> 18:43.813
I'm amazed by that. I think that
makes perfect sense, doesn't it?

18:43.853 --> 18:47.029
Cos whenever I drive a really nice,
- exciting car I always get

18:47.069 --> 18:51.157
like a nice little fizzing sensation.

18:51.197 --> 18:55.001
No, it's not... Where is
this fizzing sensation?

18:55.041 --> 18:57.125
It's not actually in
my penis, but it's...

18:57.165 --> 19:00.781
but it's sort of just behind it.

19:00.821 --> 19:03.125
A fizzing sensation
just behind your penis?

19:03.165 --> 19:05.341
Yeah. So, isn't that
the pit of your stomach?

19:05.381 --> 19:08.253
No, no, lower down than
that, sort of right...

19:08.293 --> 19:13.781
That's your prostate, mate.
You've sat on the gear.

19:13.821 --> 19:17.253
Does anybody else have a fizzing
sensation just behind their penis...

19:17.293 --> 19:20.701
Am I the only person... Ah! Thank
you, sir. You have? Good man.

19:20.741 --> 19:24.813
Or do you just want to be on television?

19:24.853 --> 19:27.093
Come here. Do come here.

19:27.133 --> 19:32.313
It's just got a lot worse! James May, a
man in a moustache has come on the stage

19:32.353 --> 19:35.765
and wishes to meet you to discuss...
Please, have a seat. ..your fizzing penises.

19:35.805 --> 19:39.141
That's the end of the news. Oh, God!

19:39.181 --> 19:42.861
APPLAUSE

19:42.901 --> 19:45.109
I'd like to commend you
on being brave enough,

19:45.149 --> 19:48.017
especially as you've grown
a moustache for charity,

19:48.057 --> 19:51.861
to come on the stage and admit that
- you too have been bestowed

19:51.901 --> 19:55.501
with this great gift from the
gods of a slight fizzing sensation

19:55.541 --> 19:58.937
somewhere behind your penis but in front of
your prostate when you drive an exciting car.

19:58.977 --> 20:02.221
What sort of car are you
driving when you feel it?

20:02.261 --> 20:06.173
Citroen AX.

20:06.213 --> 20:09.005
Honestly, no, seriously...

20:09.045 --> 20:19.657
we really must invite you to...
go back over there. Thank you.

20:19.697 --> 20:22.349
I think some of us are just
more fortunate than others.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.065
You must have had this on
a motorcycle. No, never!

20:25.105 --> 20:30.253
I'm just gonna stand. I don't
even want to use that seat now.

20:30.293 --> 20:34.037
Now, we have to just touch on
something, don't we, before we go,

20:34.077 --> 20:36.549
because... LAUGHTER

20:36.589 --> 20:41.269
No, we don't, no. No, no, no. Argh!

20:41.309 --> 20:44.097
The news has gone wrong this week.

20:44.137 --> 20:48.409
I'd rather chop them off.
I'd rather slice them.

20:48.449 --> 20:51.881
Thing is, next week
we're doing this item

20:51.921 --> 20:57.445
on which car company has produced
the largest number of great cars.

20:57.485 --> 21:00.501
This is GREAT cars? Yes, GREAT cars.
- So, any thoughts on which

21:00.541 --> 21:05.221
car company's made the
biggest number of GREAT cars?

21:05.261 --> 21:07.521
See, Aston Martin isn't...

21:07.561 --> 21:10.849
I don't think Aston has made a single
great, GREAT car. They make some lovely...

21:10.889 --> 21:14.129
DB5 was only great because of
JamesBond. It's actually a bit rubbish...

21:14.169 --> 21:16.677
Exactly. Anyone else got any thoughts?

21:16.717 --> 21:19.973
Who said Ferrari? Somebody said Ferrari
over there. That's a good call, but...

21:20.013 --> 21:23.457
It's a good call, but if you think about
it, they've made a lot of rubbish cars too.

21:23.497 --> 21:26.053
Their 348 was rubbish, the
Testarossa was rubbish...

21:26.093 --> 21:29.525
Mondial was rubbish. The F40
was a great car. That was great.

21:29.565 --> 21:32.269
But what about mainstream
manufacturers, though? Ford.

21:32.309 --> 21:34.925
They did the Model T, that's
kind of an important car.

21:34.965 --> 21:38.173
Mustang... GT40 is a great car.

21:38.213 --> 21:41.709
This, I think, is an interesting
debate that petrol heads can have.

21:41.749 --> 21:43.805
We genuinely would like to
hear what you have to say,

21:43.845 --> 21:47.445
so do please go on our website,
which is on the internet,

21:47.485 --> 21:51.193
and then write something on... I don't
know how you... Write something on it,

21:51.233 --> 21:56.085
which car firm you think has produced the largest
number of great cars. If you write that down

21:56.125 --> 21:59.817
on our internet...we'll read it.

21:59.857 --> 22:02.301
LAUGHTER

22:02.341 --> 22:06.493
Now, last year I drove an Audi R8,
and I thought it was the knees of

22:06.533 --> 22:09.253
the bee, but in a straight line, at
- least, it was a little bit slower

22:09.293 --> 22:11.021
than a Porsche 911.

22:11.061 --> 22:14.117
Yeah, quite a lot slower
than a 911, actually.

22:14.157 --> 22:17.613
It was about THAT much slower. I admit
that much makes all the difference.

22:17.653 --> 22:21.973
LAUGHTER

22:22.013 --> 22:35.101
However, Audi has now
released a new faster version.

22:35.141 --> 22:40.245
This is it, and it looks pretty
much the same as the original.

22:40.285 --> 22:48.009
However...

22:48.049 --> 22:53.009
The standard R8 has a 4.2-litre V8.

22:53.049 --> 23:01.605
THIS has a 5.2-litre Lamborghini V10.

23:01.645 --> 23:05.973
That means 518-brake horsepower...

23:06.013 --> 23:09.509
enough torque to tenderise an elephant

23:09.549 --> 23:15.477
and a top speed of about 200mph.

23:15.517 --> 23:20.069
0 to 60 is dealt with in
3.7 seconds. That's there -

23:20.109 --> 23:24.789
80, 90, 100, 110,

23:24.829 --> 23:28.741
120, 125 in eight seconds.

23:28.781 --> 23:33.245
This thing is phenomenal!

23:33.285 --> 23:47.213
The handling is pretty epic as well.

23:47.253 --> 23:52.933
As a driver's car, this
is...spectacularly good.

23:52.973 --> 24:00.761
It's like Scarlett Johansson's lips
- or the roof of Paddington Station.

24:00.801 --> 24:04.773
Absolutely faultless.

24:04.813 --> 24:08.229
Oh, God, it's good!

24:08.269 --> 24:10.413
Oh, mmmmm!

24:10.501 --> 24:19.369
r!

24:19.409 --> 24:27.413
And unlike most super-cars, it's
not even desperately impractical.

24:27.453 --> 24:32.385
You get a boot, which is big
enough- for three medium-sized goats.

24:32.425 --> 24:34.697
You get a useful shelf behind the seats,

24:34.737 --> 24:39.933
and you get room inside to move about
- and breathe.

24:39.973 --> 24:43.125
There are a couple of mistakes, I admit.

24:43.165 --> 24:47.133
If, for instance, you have a can of
- tangy, refreshing drink here

24:47.173 --> 24:49.685
in the cup holder, and
you go to change gear,

24:49.725 --> 24:52.841
your elbow's going to knock
it and that's annoying.

24:52.881 --> 24:57.169
And as far as I can work out,
the trip computer isn't working.

24:57.209 --> 24:59.765
I don't like to say that because
it would have been installed by

24:59.805 --> 25:02.777
a German who will be shot
at dawn for his mistake,

25:02.817 --> 25:07.885
but it...it doesn't.

25:07.925 --> 25:12.793
And then there's the biggest mistake of them all
- the price.

25:12.833 --> 25:16.341
It's Â£100,000. And
that's just the start.

25:16.381 --> 25:20.465
If you want ceramic brakes, Â£7,000.

25:20.505 --> 25:23.485
Flappy-paddle gearbox, Â£5,000.

25:23.525 --> 25:26.341
If you want the boot
lined in fake suede,

25:26.381 --> 25:28.309
Â£1,600.

25:28.349 --> 25:31.389
Bucket seats
- Â£2,350.

25:31.429 --> 25:35.793
Colour co-ordinated
seatbelts - 750 quid!

25:35.833 --> 25:39.249
If you want these panels,
here, finished in carbon fibre,

25:39.289 --> 25:42.309
you're mad, mad as a Mexican's dog.

25:42.349 --> 25:48.485
They even charge Â£500 if you want to
pick the car up from the factory yourself.

25:48.525 --> 25:51.389
That's like charging someone
Â£10 extra for a bottle of wine

25:51.429 --> 25:53.777
if you tread the grapes yourself.

25:53.817 --> 25:59.309
I'd tell them to get lost.

25:59.349 --> 26:05.513
Strangely, however, it's not the money
that would stop me buying this car.

26:05.553 --> 26:09.889
The trouble is... is
it's a bit too joyless.

26:09.929 --> 26:12.361
A bit too like Scarlett
Johansson's lips.

26:12.401 --> 26:17.953
You can...never imagine
this thing smiling.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.669
I mean, look what happens,
OK, if I hit this button here.

26:20.709 --> 26:24.157
"Sport mode on," exclamation mark.

26:24.197 --> 26:27.045
What's it got an exclamation mark for?

26:27.085 --> 26:32.857
You put the sport on in a
super-car? You mad, crazy fool, you!

26:32.897 --> 26:34.845
Look at the sat-nav, OK.

26:34.885 --> 26:39.565
It can take you to a bank or a
bowling alley or a bus station.

26:39.605 --> 26:42.233
I'm sorry? Golf course.

26:42.273 --> 26:44.593
Historical monument.

26:44.633 --> 26:46.517
Yes, I've got a super-car,
but I'm going to stop off

26:46.557 --> 26:51.249
and look at this Neolithic fort!

26:51.289 --> 26:55.001
The R8 V10, then, doesn't really do fun.

26:55.041 --> 26:59.721
It doesn't do pantomime, so if I
was spending Â£100,000 on a car,

26:59.761 --> 27:20.033
I'd think very seriously
about buying something worse.

27:20.073 --> 27:35.297
This is the Corvette ZR1,
which is extremely fast.

27:35.337 --> 27:39.441
This has a super-charged
6.2-litre engine,

27:39.481 --> 27:49.269
which is a turbot compared to
Audi's 5.2-litre un-supercharged cod.

27:49.309 --> 27:56.081
Put it in a drag race with the
R8 and the results are inevitable.

27:56.121 --> 28:02.393
I have got 120 more
horsepower than the R8...

28:02.433 --> 28:05.781
and because the Corvette
is made from plastic,

28:05.821 --> 28:09.581
it's lighter as well.

28:09.621 --> 28:13.237
If only America could win
its wars so convincingly.

28:13.277 --> 28:18.441
However, there are a few problems.

28:18.481 --> 28:22.237
I tested one in America
last year and, erm...

28:22.277 --> 28:25.989
after three days, it was starting to
fall apart, and then on the fourth,

28:26.029 --> 28:29.221
it refused to start.

28:29.261 --> 28:32.317
It's also insanely vulgar.

28:32.357 --> 28:35.065
It's only available
with left-hand drive.

28:35.105 --> 28:38.409
The luggage cover looks
like a motel shower curtain.

28:38.449 --> 28:47.693
It's much too wide and in the
corners, it's a complete mad man.

28:47.733 --> 28:51.141
Oh.

28:51.181 --> 28:55.769
When I drove this thing
in California, I loved it!

28:55.809 --> 28:59.241
But I think it might have
been a holiday romance,

28:59.281 --> 29:04.501
because here on our track it's,
it's... Well, let's be kind,

29:04.541 --> 29:15.925
let's say difficult.

29:15.965 --> 29:20.833
Remember, I've got more
power than the Ferrari Enzo.

29:20.873 --> 29:27.301
Oh, my God. Come on!
Get in a straight line!

29:27.341 --> 29:30.429
I may have more firepower, but
trying to keep up with the Audi

29:30.469 --> 29:34.925
is like trying to win the Grand
National whilst riding a lion,

29:34.965 --> 29:38.893
that's made out of teeth and jelly.

29:38.933 --> 29:42.221
It sort of wobbles about and
then if you're not careful,

29:42.261 --> 29:45.085
it bites your arm off. Aaahh!

29:45.125 --> 29:48.833
Oh, no! I'm gone!

29:48.873 --> 29:53.165
The thing is, though, despite the
waywardness and the terrible danger,

29:53.205 --> 29:57.021
the Corvette is more fun.

29:57.061 --> 30:01.833
It's disintegrating already, I'm
being strangled by my own seatbelt

30:01.873 --> 30:09.273
and the end's come off! Get on!

30:09.313 --> 30:13.177
Be in no doubt, then
- the Audi is a better car.

30:13.217 --> 30:16.133
It's better built, better
to look at, better to drive,

30:16.173 --> 30:19.849
more comfortable, easier to
park, and, in the real world,

30:19.889 --> 30:23.509
faster.

30:23.549 --> 30:27.381
You'd have to be bonkers
to buy the Corvette.

30:27.421 --> 30:36.053
And that is why you should.

30:36.093 --> 30:39.477
APPLAUSE

30:39.517 --> 30:42.149
It's that exclamation mark that
says everything about that car.

30:42.189 --> 30:44.289
You want Sport Mode?! Sport Mode!

30:44.329 --> 30:46.817
Sport Mode!

30:46.857 --> 30:49.177
Oh, now, ah-ha...

30:49.217 --> 30:51.445
I have got an apology to make.

30:51.485 --> 30:55.365
I said in that film that the Audi's
- trip computer was broken.

30:55.405 --> 30:59.401
It isn't, OK? It turned out I hadn't
pressed the reset button properly.

30:59.441 --> 31:00.965
LAUGHTER

31:01.005 --> 31:03.525
We did actually ring Audi
to confess to what he'd done,

31:03.565 --> 31:07.805
but it was too late. The man
responsible had...shot himself.

31:07.845 --> 31:09.649
Yeah. He had.

31:09.689 --> 31:16.177
Anyway, it's now time to put both cars
in the hands of our tame racing driver.

31:16.217 --> 31:21.149
Some say that he has some terrible
plans involving the moon...

31:21.189 --> 31:22.993
LAUGHTER

31:23.033 --> 31:27.461
..and that he was turned down for a place
on I'm A Celebrity because he IS one.

31:27.501 --> 31:30.713
LAUGHTER

31:30.753 --> 31:32.853
All we know is... he's called The Stig!

31:32.893 --> 31:35.333
CHEERING

31:35.373 --> 31:38.085
They're off! A genuinely
interesting battle, this,

31:38.125 --> 31:41.213
because the Corvette is
faster in a straight line,

31:41.253 --> 31:43.305
but it needs an extraordinary talent

31:43.345 --> 31:46.649
to get it round corners
without crashing.

31:46.689 --> 31:48.229
Look at that.

31:48.269 --> 31:49.821
And there is the talent.

31:49.861 --> 31:53.461
MUSIC: "When I'm Cleaning Windows"

31:53.501 --> 31:57.805
Oh dear, Stig continues to make
each lap into a Cockney knees-up.

31:57.845 --> 32:01.309
Ooh, did you see that? Weirdly,
it's the Audi going sideways.

32:01.349 --> 32:04.493
Through Chicago. What'll
happen in Hammerhead?

32:04.533 --> 32:08.053
Let's have a look here.

32:08.093 --> 32:11.213
Again it's the four-wheel
drive R8 that's out of shape.

32:11.253 --> 32:14.053
The 'Vette in the Stig's
talented paws clinging on.

32:14.093 --> 32:16.025
A wiggle on the way out, but that's it.

32:16.065 --> 32:20.089
MUSIC CONTINUES

32:20.129 --> 32:21.977
Right.
Follow-through -

32:22.017 --> 32:25.541
this is where the
Corvette's super-charged V8

32:25.581 --> 32:27.885
can really deliver some shock and awe.

32:27.925 --> 32:29.901
The tyres
- they are both quick through there.

32:29.941 --> 32:32.773
It's the in-bred lunatic versus
a car with no sense of humour,

32:32.813 --> 32:35.201
and they're pretty much
neck-and-neck, just Gambon to go.

32:35.241 --> 32:39.697
Both sigh through there,
and they cross the line.

32:39.737 --> 32:42.977
And now we have the times... APPLAUSE

32:43.017 --> 32:45.133
Audi.

32:45.173 --> 32:46.853
The Audi first?

32:46.893 --> 32:52.949
It did it in 1:21.6, which
puts it... That's for the Audi.

32:52.989 --> 32:58.013
1:21.6? That was sort of a damp-ish-
lap, as well. That's quick, OK.

32:58.053 --> 33:02.921
However, Corvette did it in 1:20.4.
- What?!

33:02.961 --> 33:07.045
No... But the thing is, I reckon
you or I could get the Audi round

33:07.085 --> 33:09.841
in roughly that time, OK?

33:09.881 --> 33:13.965
But there's no way we could make the Corvette go round in that.
- Literally, I would

33:14.005 --> 33:18.405
be five minutes dead. ..AND dead. Five
minutes AND dead is what it would be.

33:18.445 --> 33:22.433
Anyway, now it is time to put a
star in our reasonably-priced car,

33:22.473 --> 33:24.889
and my guest tonight is an actor.

33:24.929 --> 33:28.573
He has played Kenneth Williams,
who is no longer with us,

33:28.613 --> 33:31.417
he's played Brian Clough,
who's no longer with us,

33:31.457 --> 33:33.529
and he's played Tony Blair, who, um...

33:33.569 --> 33:35.793
LAUGHTER

33:35.833 --> 33:37.777
..IS still with us.

33:37.817 --> 33:39.733
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Sheen!

33:39.773 --> 33:43.293
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

33:43.333 --> 33:45.325
How are you?

33:45.365 --> 33:49.717
Have a seat. Lovely.

33:49.757 --> 33:52.529
I thought you were going
to look like Tony Blair.

33:52.569 --> 33:55.213
I... It's my day off
today. Cos it's weird -

33:55.253 --> 33:58.825
when I watched The Queen,
obviously when you WERE Tony Blair,

33:58.865 --> 34:03.513
I remember thinking, "God, they did very well to find an actor
- who looks so like him."

34:03.553 --> 34:05.261
But you're much better looking!

34:05.301 --> 34:06.889
LAUGHTER

34:06.929 --> 34:09.341
It's not hard, is it? Do people
think you're going to look like him?

34:09.380 --> 34:12.621
In America people think I'm
a Tony Blair look-alike, yeah.

34:12.661 --> 34:16.248
But you're not. I don't do
work as a Tony Blair look-alike,

34:16.289 --> 34:19.341
although I do have
look-alikes in my family.

34:19.380 --> 34:21.469
My dad is a Jack Nicholson
look-alike. Is he?

34:21.509 --> 34:24.157
He is indeed. Cos I was looking
back at your family history

34:24.197 --> 34:27.185
and it was all very weird, because
nobody's done anything conventional

34:27.225 --> 34:30.077
since the dawn of human
history... That's true.

34:30.117 --> 34:35.529
Your great-grandmother was... She was the first
elephant and lion- tamer in Barnum & Bailey Circus.

34:35.569 --> 34:37.545
Right...! LAUGHTER

34:37.585 --> 34:43.797
Her name was Nanny Blower, and God bless her,
she was talented, but she wasn't a looker.

34:43.837 --> 34:48.001
She had her left breast mauled off
by a lion, and the claw of that lion

34:48.041 --> 34:50.420
is on a chain somewhere in our family.

34:50.460 --> 34:52.360
Seriously? Yeah.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.533
And it's at this point you go,
"And we have that lion for you now!"

34:55.572 --> 34:58.673
I wish I'd known. I
would have looked into it.

34:58.713 --> 35:03.205
There was your... Not grandfather...
Great-grandfather. Who was the one who got drunk a lot?

35:03.245 --> 35:08.141
Yeah, my great grandfather was a bit
of a waster in the town, in Port Talbot,

35:08.181 --> 35:12.517
and the story goes that he was lying in the gutter
one night, having been chucked out of the pub,

35:12.557 --> 35:16.985
and the moon appeared through the clouds, and
God spoke to him through the moon and said,

35:17.025 --> 35:22.517
"You must mend your ways. Save up money and buy the
disused tin mine in the mountain." So from then on

35:22.557 --> 35:26.125
he never touched another drink and he
saved his money. Everyone thought he was mad

35:26.165 --> 35:29.517
cos there was no tin left. They
discovered a new vein of tin,

35:29.557 --> 35:33.877
he became the richest man in Port Talbot
and became a street preacher from then on.

35:33.917 --> 35:37.365
This is fantastic. Then your dad
was a Jack Nicholson impersonator...

35:37.405 --> 35:40.969
A Jack Nicholson look-alike, not an
impersonator. Look-alike. There is a difference.

35:41.009 --> 35:44.517
He's a genetic freak,
not a talented actor.

35:44.557 --> 35:46.577
LAUGHTER

35:46.617 --> 35:51.613
And now you're Tony Blair and David Frost... And Kenneth Williams
- and Brian Clough.

35:51.653 --> 35:53.453
This is... Can I just,

35:53.493 --> 35:57.005
first of all, can I just take a moment
to congratulate you on Frost/Nixon.

35:57.045 --> 35:59.549
That was amazing. Thank you
very much. Rocky is what it was.

35:59.589 --> 36:03.705
It was Rocky for interviewers. Instead
of fighting, it was interviewing Nixon.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.937
Brilliant film, I adored that.

36:05.977 --> 36:11.393
And I was just wondering, why
do you choose parts predominantly

36:11.433 --> 36:14.365
Now, the new film, Twilight
- it's New Moon, isn't it, from the Twilight series?

36:14.405 --> 36:16.453
which you did this presumably because
you've got a 10-year-old daughter.

36:16.493 --> 36:20.285
Yes. I have a 10-year-old daughter who
is obsessed with the books. As have I.

36:20.325 --> 36:24.501
Completely besotted. And I always
say to her, "What are they about?"

36:24.669 --> 36:29.093
rl,

36:29.133 --> 36:33.349
"and she's in love with a werewolf, but she
was..." and I say, "What are you reading?!"

36:33.389 --> 36:36.425
It's sort of this great love story,
- it seems,

36:36.465 --> 36:41.409
and also, you know, they sort
of tap into something about...

36:41.449 --> 36:45.085
particularly a teenage
girl's experience growing up.

36:45.125 --> 36:47.909
So you're a v... I am a vampire.

36:47.949 --> 36:50.253
So was it Peter Mandelson this time
- you modelled it on?

36:50.293 --> 36:53.445
Yes, absolutely, completely
modelled it on Peter Mandelson.

36:53.485 --> 37:00.973
Now, cars - you spend a lot of
time- living there in Los Angeles,

37:01.013 --> 37:29.725
so I would assume you
have some form of hybrid.

37:29.765 --> 37:30.413
It

37:30.453 --> 37:30.613
It was

37:30.653 --> 37:35.129
It was a

37:35.169 --> 37:39.941
It was a Datsun Sunny and a Ford
 Orion. I am not one who spends a

37:39.981 --> 37:45.193
lot of money on cars. You spend a 
lot of time in Los Angeles. I would

37:45.233 --> 37:54.209
have assumed you would have some
 form of hybrid. No, not really.

37:54.249 --> 38:04.349
There is a lot of pressure. It is 
the way for a. It is. I am going to

38:04.389 --> 38:09.273
get a Jaguar. -- the way forward.
 I'd like to get a green one.

38:09.313 --> 38:11.661
So when you go on American chat shows
and they say, "You got a hybrid?"

38:11.701 --> 38:13.349
You can say, "No, I have
a Jag." "I have a Ja-a-ag."

38:13.389 --> 38:14.833
So what do you use in England?

38:14.873 --> 38:16.569
I nip around London on a scooter.

38:16.609 --> 38:18.629
I once rode one of those across
Vietnam. It tried to kill me.

38:18.669 --> 38:20.709
Did you ever fall off?
They're fantastic. In fact,

38:20.749 --> 38:25.225
when I first got the scooter, it was just
before I started playing Kenneth Williams

38:25.265 --> 38:27.585
in this film I did, Fantabulosa!

38:27.625 --> 38:31.209
And I was desperately trying to lose as
much weight as I possibly could to play him,

38:31.249 --> 38:34.493
so I went on the cabbage soup diet
for the last ten days. Which is great,

38:34.533 --> 38:38.973
I lost ten pounds, but I did used to lose consciousness as well.
- I was so faint.

38:39.013 --> 38:42.693
So I was driving around on
this scooter around London,

38:42.733 --> 38:47.165
which was scary enough as it was,
but I was also constantly farting.

38:47.205 --> 38:49.005
My stomach was making terrible noises,

38:49.045 --> 38:51.165
and whilst I used to drive it
I used to practise the voice,

38:51.205 --> 38:56.445
so if anyone saw an Aprilia going
past them around the Clapham area

38:56.485 --> 39:00.973
with a slightly sepia-looking
visor- and a smell coming behind it

39:01.013 --> 39:04.773
and a voice going "mrr-rr-rr-rr"
as it was going along, that was me.

39:04.813 --> 39:06.965
Did you ever fall off it?

39:07.005 --> 39:08.509
No, I never fell off it.

39:08.549 --> 39:11.761
I kept the stabilisers on, obviously.

39:11.801 --> 39:14.853
Anyway, obviously you
came here, I have to say,

39:14.893 --> 39:17.537
Los Angeles, THIS morning...

39:17.577 --> 39:20.165
I came from the airport
straight here and into the car.

39:20.205 --> 39:23.009
So you're... Well, what are
we, ten hours out... Yeah.

39:23.049 --> 39:24.945
I have no idea what time...

39:24.985 --> 39:28.525
I'll tell you what time it is. It's
- 6:30am, so it's time you were up.

39:28.565 --> 39:31.557
I think there should be a new category,
which is, instead of just "W" for "wet",

39:31.597 --> 39:33.213
there should be "JL" for jet lag. Jet lag.
And I believe... Was it damp out there as well?

39:33.253 --> 39:37.933
It was damp-ish.

39:37.973 --> 39:42.257
So that's jet-lagged and damp. And there
were people shooting bows and arrows.

39:42.297 --> 39:45.933
Shooting bows and arrows. Many, many
things we have to write down. Many.

39:45.973 --> 39:49.741
Jet-lagged, damp, bows and arrows.
And I'm Welsh. And you're Welsh.

39:49.781 --> 39:51.413
LAUGHTER

39:51.453 --> 39:53.509
In fact, who are the other
Welsh people on there?

39:53.549 --> 39:56.181
Have I got a chance
of being top Welshman?

39:56.221 --> 39:59.229
Alan Davies, is he Welsh? Or does he
just have a name... He's not Welsh.

39:59.269 --> 40:03.665
Rob Brydon. Rob Brydon
- where's he?

40:03.705 --> 40:08.025
Tom Jones. It would be good to beat
- Dame Helen Mirren, wouldn't it?

40:08.065 --> 40:12.509
She's here. Tom Jones did. Tom Jones is on
top of Helen Mirren, not for the first time!

40:12.549 --> 40:14.949
There's Rob Brydon,
just below Keith Allen.

40:14.989 --> 40:18.665
This is kind of Little Wales, here, this
area. So this is where you're aiming for.

40:18.705 --> 40:23.009
I want to be the fastest
boy in the village.

40:23.049 --> 40:25.133
That's Little Britain.
I've just got that.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.869
I'm there! See, even
jet-lagged, I'm on form, Jeremy!

40:27.909 --> 40:29.133
LAUGHTER

40:29.173 --> 40:30.413
Who'd like to see the lap?

40:30.453 --> 40:33.089
ALL: Yeah! Let's have a look at this.

40:33.129 --> 40:34.949
Oh, dear Lord...

40:34.989 --> 40:45.133
TYRES SCREECH

40:45.173 --> 40:47.325
Nice, smooth gear change.
'He's really ruined that.'

40:47.365 --> 40:49.073
So here we go, coming up to
the first corner... Ooh, I say,

40:49.113 --> 40:51.493
that's a vigorous turn in there.

40:51.533 --> 40:56.045
Right, so we're not going
for the smooth approach.

40:56.085 --> 40:57.965
Brake, you BLEEP, brake!

40:58.005 --> 40:59.841
LAUGHTER

40:59.881 --> 41:02.201
I like the hands on the
wheel there. That's wide!

41:02.241 --> 41:04.809
This really is...

41:04.849 --> 41:07.933
Don't go into fourth, Michael,
go into second, try that!

41:07.973 --> 41:11.841
Well, one'll do! No, you're
supposed to LOOK slow,

41:11.881 --> 41:16.089
so that you're actually...
That's not looking slow.

41:16.129 --> 41:18.089
That's looking wide again.

41:18.129 --> 41:19.885
The Stig did say,
well, he communicated...

41:19.925 --> 41:22.653
Textbook. Absolute textbook.

41:22.693 --> 41:24.337
LAUGHTER

41:24.377 --> 41:26.561
That's not what The Stig
said. He said "clunky".

41:26.601 --> 41:30.433
"Clunky but brave" is how he
described you. Clunky but brave!

41:30.473 --> 41:33.997
It's not healthy, that's
not healthy, Michael!

41:34.037 --> 41:35.541
Looking very Welsh.

41:35.581 --> 41:37.029
That's pretty quick!

41:37.069 --> 41:38.561
Oh-oh! Yes!

41:38.601 --> 41:40.057
Now you go... Look...

41:40.097 --> 41:42.185
Holy cow, that's quick!

41:42.225 --> 41:43.933
That's very quick!

41:43.973 --> 41:45.261
Now, what about Gambon?

41:45.301 --> 41:46.589
Bloody hell, look at that!

41:46.629 --> 41:49.873
And across the line! That was amazing.

41:49.913 --> 41:55.389
CHEERING

41:55.429 --> 42:02.137
I have here... Mm, mm,
mm-mm-mm mm-mm-mm... LAUGHTER

42:02.177 --> 42:04.981
If it's under Roger
Bannister's mile, I'll be happy.

42:05.021 --> 42:06.921
Under four minutes.

42:06.961 --> 42:10.545
So you want to be somewhere down...
- The top of the Welsh zone.

42:10.585 --> 42:15.373
It would be nice if I was, you know, above
Helen, and I would love it if I was above Rob.

42:15.413 --> 42:20.109
So they're all around the one...
Rob's 1:51.7, but that was wet.

42:20.149 --> 42:23.829
Michael Sheen, you
did it in one minute...

42:23.869 --> 42:25.293
Yes...

42:25.333 --> 42:27.213
..forty...

42:27.253 --> 42:30.249
..six, point three.

42:30.289 --> 42:32.309
Good Lord!

42:32.349 --> 42:35.421
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

42:36.557 --> 42:37.829
Seriously.

42:37.869 --> 42:39.421
How did that happen?

42:39.461 --> 42:41.361
That was a brave lap.

42:41.401 --> 42:43.313
Gordon Ramsay just committed suicide.

42:43.353 --> 42:45.749
I'm sort of mystified.

42:45.789 --> 42:50.389
That was very fast. You can see it,
- cos you were doing a million down the straight.

42:50.429 --> 42:52.485
I heard that Tom Jones
didn't want to come in,

42:52.525 --> 42:55.093
and it must be something Welsh,
cos I didn't want to stop,

42:55.133 --> 42:59.577
I wanted to keep going. I could
have beaten Jay Kay. Help yourself!

42:59.617 --> 43:01.845
There's still 20
minutes of daylight left.

43:01.885 --> 43:04.701
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Sheen!

43:04.741 --> 43:07.437
Thank you very much.

43:07.477 --> 43:15.329
Thank you very much.

43:15.369 --> 43:20.341
Now, earlier on, we built
an electric car called Geoff,

43:20.381 --> 43:23.081
and he was...a disaster.

43:23.121 --> 43:25.217
Now, I'm not one to apportion blame,

43:25.257 --> 43:27.813
but it was entirely James' fault.

43:27.853 --> 43:29.625
Why?

43:29.665 --> 43:32.441
Well, because...Jeremy's
body was brilliant...

43:32.481 --> 43:35.893
Er, not Jeremy's actual
body, cos that's horrible.

43:35.933 --> 43:38.013
The one on the car. My
chassis was brilliant,

43:38.053 --> 43:42.005
and your battery system was
terrible. Well, it wasn't! Well...

43:42.045 --> 43:46.329
it was. And, as a result, Geoff
ended up crashed into a wood.

43:46.369 --> 43:49.061
We didn't give up. We decided
to go back to the drawing board,

43:49.101 --> 43:53.501
and build Geoff II.

43:53.541 --> 43:59.877
Back at the Top Gear Technology Centre, I fitted
narrower wheels which would reduce friction.

43:59.917 --> 44:04.221
And James, mercifully,
found some more batteries.

44:04.261 --> 44:07.205
I've also devised a
very, very clever way

44:07.245 --> 44:12.017
of recharging them
while we're on the move.

44:12.057 --> 44:15.329
Meanwhile, in the mood
room, Jeremy had decided

44:15.369 --> 44:19.049
Geoff should no longer be called Geoff.

44:19.089 --> 44:20.989
Hammerhead.

44:21.029 --> 44:24.285
Hammerhead Shark. That's a dolphin.

44:24.325 --> 44:26.253
I know, but it's like
a hammerhead shark.

44:26.293 --> 44:28.629
Not really. It lives in the sea. Yeah...

44:28.669 --> 44:32.501
I'll tell you the other thing
we've got to have, is the letter I.

44:32.541 --> 44:35.425
Why? Because if you put
little i, not capital I,

44:35.465 --> 44:37.253
little i with a little dot on it,

44:37.293 --> 44:40.005
it tells everyone who
sees it that it's eco,

44:40.045 --> 44:45.189
and that's OK. Doesn't. It does,
cos ecomentalists are stupid.

44:45.229 --> 44:54.645
After many days of development,
ournew, improved car was finally ready.

44:54.685 --> 44:57.785
But Jeremy, you haven't done anything.

44:57.825 --> 44:59.725
You can't improve on perfection.

44:59.765 --> 45:02.221
Anyway, I have done something. Look.

45:02.261 --> 45:04.645
An energy-absorbing front end.

45:04.685 --> 45:08.053
You can have massive accidents
and no damage will be caused.

45:08.093 --> 45:10.473
You could run this into
a wood at top speed -

45:10.513 --> 45:12.833
nothing would happen.

45:12.873 --> 45:17.473
Then James unveiled his
radical new propulsion system.

45:17.513 --> 45:23.833
Look at this! Batteries as before. But a few more
of them for extra power. Here's the clever bit.

45:23.873 --> 45:29.085
They're recharged by that.
That is a diesel generator.

45:29.125 --> 45:32.909
That charges the batteries? Yeah.
that a generator just from a shop?

45:32.949 --> 45:38.961
Yeah. So, we've made a hybrid?! Yeah, sort of! No, because a hybrid
- uses a normal engine

45:39.001 --> 45:43.005
that drives the wheels. A hybrid is
- a normal car for fools.

45:43.045 --> 45:49.661
This just charges the battery. a diesel electric.
I got the idea from old railway locomotives.

45:49.701 --> 45:54.849
So you just run the generator. means that
you'll never run out electricity. Exactly. Yeah.

45:54.889 --> 45:58.053
Uses a tiny amount of fuel.

45:58.093 --> 46:03.037
Yeah! Seriously, credit where credit's due!
That's not something you hear often on Top Gear.

46:03.077 --> 46:07.525
Or ever, even! That's actually
quite a good idea. Thank you.

46:07.565 --> 46:11.053
And this will go like stink.

46:11.093 --> 46:28.849
And it did!

46:28.889 --> 46:32.253
Well, that's brilliant! It's
a hybrid! We've built a Prius!

46:32.293 --> 46:34.741
You don't think the producers are
messing with the subtitles, do you?

46:34.781 --> 46:37.973
No! They wouldn't do that!

46:38.013 --> 46:42.101
Since our amazing Eagle i
Thrust Head had cost Â£1,000 less

46:42.141 --> 46:45.477
than a G-Wiz, we
decided it was brilliant,

46:45.517 --> 46:49.585
and that we should put it on
sale to the general public.

46:49.625 --> 46:56.197
However, before you can do that, it
must pass a series of stringent EU tests.

46:56.237 --> 46:59.681
So we took the Eagle Thrust to
the motor industry's top secret

46:59.721 --> 47:08.273
proving ground, just off the A5 between
Atherstone and Hinckley near Fenny Drayton.

47:08.313 --> 47:12.229
When we get out, remember, be
positive, be positive! Yes! Positive!

47:12.269 --> 47:14.973
Everyone's a customer!

47:15.013 --> 47:19.477
We started with one of the biggies.
- A crash test.

47:19.517 --> 47:22.509
We've all seen these. A car
is loaded up with dummies

47:22.549 --> 47:26.305
and fired into a concrete block,
whilst super slow motion cameras

47:26.345 --> 47:32.945
record the impact.

47:32.985 --> 47:38.229
I, however, am so confident about
the Hammerhead-i Eagle Thrust,

47:38.269 --> 47:42.993
that we will be using a
different sort of dummy.

47:43.033 --> 47:45.977
Don't worry, we're coming as well.

47:46.017 --> 47:48.821
There you go. Done. Can
you paint one on my face?

47:48.861 --> 47:53.461
Why do crash test dummies have
these things? I don't know.

47:53.501 --> 47:58.085
For the slow motion camera that records
the impact. It gives you a datum point.

47:58.125 --> 48:01.541
Oh, I'm not interested in datum points... I didn't
think it was fashion amongst crash test dummies.

48:01.581 --> 48:04.133
Are you sure about your
new bumper design? Yeah.

48:04.173 --> 48:06.605
Thank you very much.

48:06.645 --> 48:12.589
Hang on.

48:12.629 --> 48:14.413
We were a bit frightened

48:14.453 --> 48:16.789
when we saw the concrete crash block,

48:16.829 --> 48:19.841
because we had to
crash into it at 30mph.

48:19.881 --> 48:22.741
But then Jeremy had a brainwave.

48:22.781 --> 48:25.557
Remember what I told you.

48:25.597 --> 48:28.325
It's a very, very good plan this.

48:28.365 --> 48:37.481
OK. Now, let's see the
slow motion crash footage.

48:37.521 --> 48:42.901
We're going to
cra-a-a-a-sh.

48:52.005 --> 48:56.809
Ohhhhhh!

48:56.849 --> 48:58.337
Ohhhhhh!

48:58.377 --> 49:04.653
Ow...my...chest.

49:04.693 --> 49:09.213
Do you think we fooled them? Yeah!
Yeah. We're alive! We're alive! Wow!

49:09.253 --> 49:11.169
We sur... That was...

49:11.209 --> 49:14.541
It's not even marked! Oh, man,
that was, oh...! Staggering!

49:14.581 --> 49:17.965
I think this is very convincing.

49:18.005 --> 49:25.589
Shush, shush, OK, it's now time to watch
that crash at the speed it actually happened.

49:25.629 --> 49:27.949
We're going to crash!

49:27.989 --> 49:29.765
Ooh! Oh, my nose!

49:29.805 --> 49:33.949
Oh! Oh! Ow, my chest!

49:33.989 --> 49:38.793
And there we are, a superb
result in the crash test.

49:38.833 --> 49:43.889
So, let's move on, shall we
and do...the pendulum test!

49:43.929 --> 49:46.697
This is designed to measure
how a car will stand up

49:46.737 --> 49:55.261
to being side-swiped
by a bus or a truck.

49:55.301 --> 50:01.293
Frankly, it was hard to see how we could possible
pass this, but then James came up with a plan.

50:01.333 --> 50:04.545
We need a camera. Yeah.

50:04.585 --> 50:08.765
A plan that would fool even
the most astute EU bureaucrat.

50:08.805 --> 50:13.949
Action! Wow! Wow! Wow! THEY LAUGH

50:13.989 --> 50:16.233
Pendulum!

50:16.273 --> 50:18.169
TOU KOOL!

50:18.209 --> 50:26.281
Oh, right. So, now our car is going
- to face the fearsome pendulum test.

50:26.321 --> 50:28.965
SPEECH IS REVERSED

50:29.005 --> 50:31.669
PENDULUM CLANGS

50:31.709 --> 50:34.573
Wow! Wow! Wow!

50:34.613 --> 50:39.249
Wow indeed! Another pass! And happy
- that our car was completely safe,

50:39.289 --> 50:42.593
we lined it up for a drag race.

50:42.633 --> 50:49.889
We would be up against a Toyota Prius.

50:49.929 --> 50:51.777
Chris Hoy's next-door neighbour.

50:51.817 --> 50:55.389
Hannah...the fastest girl in our office.

50:55.429 --> 50:59.517
And our main rival, the G-Wiz.

50:59.557 --> 51:04.125
This was the quietest starting line
- in drag racing history.

51:04.165 --> 51:06.981
ENGINE STARTS

51:07.021 --> 51:08.953
Until Hammond started the generator.

51:08.993 --> 51:13.293
OK, this is it! The future is here!

51:13.333 --> 51:19.469
Three, two, one!

51:19.509 --> 51:23.081
Did he jump the start? No.

51:23.121 --> 51:26.361
I am so in the lead, straight away!

51:26.401 --> 51:30.389
Oh! The Toyota's gone!

51:30.429 --> 51:34.005
Where's the G-Wiz? I am all over it!

51:34.045 --> 51:38.205
Come on!

51:38.245 --> 51:41.645
This is brilliant! I'm going to win,
- I'm going to win!

51:41.685 --> 51:49.845
Yes! Yes! Yes!

51:49.885 --> 51:52.237
JEREMY LAUGHS Yes!

51:52.277 --> 51:54.157
He beat the G-Wiz! By a mile!

51:54.197 --> 51:55.749
He beat the G-Wiz!

51:55.789 --> 51:57.893
And as ever, Hammond
was gracious in victory!

51:57.933 --> 52:00.577
Yeah! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

52:00.617 --> 52:01.957
Oh, yeah!

52:01.997 --> 52:03.597
What do you think of that, then?

52:03.637 --> 52:07.845
With your stupid little plastic gerbil!

52:07.885 --> 52:11.421
Next we had to drive on
the fearsome Belgian Pave,

52:11.461 --> 52:15.421
in a test designed to measure
both comfort and build quality.

52:15.461 --> 52:17.285
VEHICLE CLANGS ALONG

52:17.325 --> 52:19.861
THEY SHOUT WITH DISCOMFORT

52:19.901 --> 52:22.297
Oh! Haw, haw, haw!

52:22.337 --> 52:28.113
The chassis is smashing into the ground. It's
his generator weighs too much for my suspension.

52:28.153 --> 52:30.189
Ow!

52:30.229 --> 52:33.769
James! What?! The chimney's come off!

52:33.809 --> 52:36.689
Oh! Oh! That's quite...

52:36.729 --> 52:38.881
Quite a lot of smoke in here!

52:38.921 --> 52:42.521
THEY COUGH It's all
collecting in my Pope box!

52:42.561 --> 52:44.801
VEHICLE CLANGS AND CLANKS Ow!

52:44.841 --> 52:48.533
But we're still going!

52:48.573 --> 52:50.957
Yeah, we're hammering now!

52:50.997 --> 52:53.597
Ow!

52:53.637 --> 52:56.141
Oh! Has one of the doors fallen off?

52:56.181 --> 52:59.333
No! No? Well then we
passed! I think we have.

52:59.373 --> 53:05.285
It's an EU regulation. Is it? It actually
says if the doors are on after doing this,

53:05.325 --> 53:10.645
then you've passed!
Well, they're still on!

53:10.685 --> 53:14.769
Although we'd been a bit
gassed, the torture wasn't over!

53:14.809 --> 53:19.709
So we re-attached the stove pipe and
went to see how the Eagle i-Thrust

53:19.749 --> 53:23.253
would perform in the fearsome steep
- hill test.

53:23.293 --> 53:27.881
OK, we're off!

53:27.921 --> 53:35.069
GRILLE CLANGS Come on!

53:35.109 --> 53:46.165
Come on.

53:46.205 --> 53:49.849
I think we've passed this! Yeah!
Well done, everybody, that's good!

53:49.889 --> 53:52.145
Yeah, we've passed. I bet the
G-Wiz wouldn't get up here.

53:52.185 --> 53:54.301
I bet it wouldn't! No!

53:54.341 --> 53:59.069
In the interest of fairness, we decided
to see how the G-Wiz would get on.

53:59.109 --> 54:04.833
Using, of course, an
independent test driver!

54:04.873 --> 54:07.629
Is he good, this guy?

54:07.669 --> 54:11.913
He's independent, that's
the important thing.

54:11.953 --> 54:15.381
It's Â£1,000 more than our
car, this. Hard to believe.

54:15.421 --> 54:18.553
Will it go 1,000 feet higher
up this hill? Let's see!

54:18.593 --> 54:21.085
Oh! It... Uh...

54:21.125 --> 54:22.929
It's struggling!

54:22.969 --> 54:27.149
Now that's a failure! Yeah, there
you go! Right there, that's a failure!

54:27.189 --> 54:34.005
The Ham Head Eagle i was sailing through
every test the EU could throw at it!

54:34.045 --> 54:36.585
But then it was time to
head to the wind tunnel

54:36.625 --> 54:41.457
where we could measure the
aerodynamic efficiency of that body.

54:41.497 --> 54:45.989
Where's Hammond? I'll call him.

54:46.029 --> 54:48.853
Hello, lads. We gonna get
on with this? THEY LAUGH

54:48.893 --> 54:52.273
Let's get going. What?! That
works! What? What? Nothing! Nothing!

54:52.313 --> 54:55.133
Well come on, then, how does it work?
I don't know. How hard can it be?

54:55.173 --> 54:58.885
Ready! FANS START

54:58.925 --> 55:02.993
FANS WHIRR Yes! Look
at this! Oh, my God!

55:03.033 --> 55:07.245
There we go, 12. 13. Here
we go. Look at the speed!

55:07.285 --> 55:15.681
28mph. I'm gonna take
this baby up a bit!

55:15.721 --> 55:18.537
When the body work ripples like
that, it does look beautiful.

55:18.577 --> 55:20.305
It looks like a fish!

55:20.345 --> 55:25.365
A really square fish with wooden ears.

55:25.405 --> 55:31.177
It's also moving. It's moving.
Did you put the handbrake on?

55:31.217 --> 55:35.229
Now, that's... Stop it or it'll go
in the fans! No, make it stop now!

55:35.269 --> 55:39.197
Stop! Stop it, Jeeves! Stop it!

55:39.237 --> 55:41.761
How do you stop the bloody fan?!

55:41.801 --> 55:45.605
CRASHING

55:45.645 --> 55:49.617
Despite the slight issue with the fans,
we decided that our car had passed.

55:49.657 --> 55:53.525
So we moved on to what
would be the final hurdle.

55:53.565 --> 55:56.121
The i-Ham would be
driven round the clock,

55:56.161 --> 56:01.713
flat out on the proving ground's
test track, to measure it's range.

56:01.753 --> 56:05.557
Obviously, in these conditions,
it's damp, there's a bit of drizzle

56:05.597 --> 56:09.229
in the air. The concentration
required to do this,

56:09.269 --> 56:15.229
is just immense! It's too demanding, we
couldn't do that. No. But we know a man who can!

56:15.269 --> 56:19.821
He's not the Stig, but he is
the Stig's vegetarian cousin.

56:19.861 --> 56:21.869
# All the leaves are brown

56:21.909 --> 56:26.805
# And the sky is grey

56:26.845 --> 56:30.073
# I've been for a walk... #

56:30.113 --> 56:36.841
What's he called? His name
is...Janet Stig Porter. Oh!

56:36.881 --> 56:39.213
Right! Fire up that generator!

56:39.253 --> 56:42.637
ENGINE STARTS

56:42.677 --> 56:46.293
Go!

56:46.333 --> 56:52.917
Look at the speed of him.

56:52.957 --> 56:57.949
James, how long, realistically, are
- you expecting that to keep going?

56:57.989 --> 57:00.917
Well, I've topped up the
geni-tank,- so that's eight hours

57:00.957 --> 57:04.541
on the generator. And that fully
charges the batteries as well,

57:04.581 --> 57:07.229
so you get another hour out
of those, just the batteries.

57:07.269 --> 57:19.213
So realistically, you're looking
for nine hours of running? Yeah.

57:19.253 --> 57:28.229
SIRENS WAIL

57:28.269 --> 57:32.229
What's happened there is...
Well, the Stig's died. Yeah.

57:32.269 --> 57:34.745
And that's because the
stove pipe came off.

57:34.785 --> 57:41.057
Now if we re-attach that stove I think
I'm right in saying, am I not, gentlemen,

57:41.097 --> 57:48.325
that the Thrust i Eagle Hammer Head
- is ready for its road test. Yes. It's ready.

57:48.365 --> 57:51.873
Obviously, we couldn't do
that, because we'd be biased,

57:51.913 --> 57:58.605
so we decided to lend it to Britain's oldest
motoring magazine for an independent review.

57:58.645 --> 58:02.153
They test all the latest cars
and innovations and to make sure

58:02.193 --> 58:06.389
they didn't realise who were the
brains behind the Eagle Head i Hammer,

58:06.429 --> 58:13.029
we had it dropped off
by an anonymous driver.

58:13.069 --> 58:19.701
Hello, how can I help you?

58:19.741 --> 58:33.293
All we could do now was
wait for their verdict.

58:33.333 --> 58:39.889
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

58:39.929 --> 58:47.217
Now, we have been sent advanced copies
of the magazine that has reviewed our car.

58:47.257 --> 58:49.497
Here it is! HE GASPS

58:49.537 --> 58:52.701
We're on the cover! We're on the cover!

58:52.741 --> 58:56.137
We have! Right, where is it?

58:56.177 --> 59:04.389
The Eagle... Right, here we go!

59:04.429 --> 59:11.137
LAUGHTER

59:11.177 --> 59:17.829
Erm...it says in the ride and handling section
where they deal with things like the chassis,

59:17.869 --> 59:23.013
that to all intents and purposes, the Hammer Head
Eagle i-Thrust has no ride and handling as such,

59:23.053 --> 59:25.857
instead it lurches around
almost uncontrollably.

59:25.897 --> 59:28.797
LAUGHTER

59:28.837 --> 59:32.593
Oh, God Almighty, no, it
gets worse! Listen to this.

59:32.633 --> 59:36.985
They say that in the Highway Code, they say the stopping distance from
- 70mph is 215 feet.
