14:57.730 --> 14:59.815
(laughter)

14:59.857 --> 15:02.067
Don't like jokes, huh?

15:02.109 --> 15:05.112
-I just prefer
the humorous ones.
-Mm.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.615
Serious man in a serious game.

15:10.659 --> 15:12.161
All right, then.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.371
Raise.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.291
-I can't match that.
-Oh, I'm sure

15:17.333 --> 15:20.044
you have something
worth wagering.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.009
Boo.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.763
Won that off some drunk old
Mexican down in San Antone.

15:32.890 --> 15:36.352
Said he found it right after
the Battle of the Alamo.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.979
Yeah, people died there

15:39.021 --> 15:40.648
for all this.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.608
You just gonna
bet that all away?

15:42.650 --> 15:44.944
What...

15:44.985 --> 15:47.446
-you got family that died there?
-How about

15:47.488 --> 15:49.782
we quit talking and play.

Would you look at that.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.632
Guess I'll just hold on to this
for a little while longer, huh?

16:08.842 --> 16:11.095
Hey, maybe next time.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.514
You hear what I said?

16:19.478 --> 16:21.814
I was speaking to you, Alamo.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.568
Maybe next time.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.370
How dare you!
Where's my ring.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.665
-Did you gamble it away?
-Here, take it.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.500
I can't believe...

16:41.542 --> 16:43.961
Why someone would do something
as low-down as that?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.546
Well, I didn't.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.635
Are you following me?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.345
You got your
damn ring back. What?

16:53.387 --> 16:54.680
I saw you in there
with that man.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.974
Would you have killed him?

16:58.267 --> 16:59.977
Well, looks like you're
starting to figure out

17:00.019 --> 17:01.687
the kind of man I am.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.819
Hoyt Rawlins.

17:10.570 --> 17:11.780
Lucia.

17:11.821 --> 17:14.575
I saw you
from across the street.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.826
I'm in town with my brother.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.828
Where is he now?

17:17.869 --> 17:20.164
He's attending to some business
for my father.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.875
-Might be a while.
-So...

17:22.915 --> 17:25.836
we have a little time
to catch up then?

17:25.877 --> 17:27.337
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

17:27.378 --> 17:30.174
-(yelps, chuckles)
-You.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.468
Stay out of trouble.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.304
(both laughing)

17:35.345 --> 17:38.265
-Let's go find ourselves a room.
-(shrieks, giggles)

That's sweet.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.541
It's kind of sad, too.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.169
I tend to play when
I'm figuring things out.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.755
Mm.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.216
Are you still wondering
if you're, uh,

18:12.257 --> 18:13.926
staying or just passing through?

18:13.967 --> 18:17.012
I might have found a reason
to be here. (sighs)

18:17.054 --> 18:18.388
Just not sure it's a good one.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.557
Honey, come here.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.685
-There.
-Oh, pardon me.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.562
Are you blushing?

18:25.604 --> 18:27.356
-Uh, the sun, it...
-Are you looking at...

18:27.397 --> 18:29.983
-No.
-(chuckles) It's okay.
I'm just kidding.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.027
You seemed like
you could use a laugh.

18:36.573 --> 18:39.368
-(sighs)
-Who is the showman
in the mural?

18:39.409 --> 18:42.871
That is Nathaniel Hagan.
He is about as subtle

18:42.913 --> 18:46.500
as a flying brick, and he
runs this place and the hotel.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.920
If the new sheriff doesn't buy
him out, if rumors prove true.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.713
A sheriff and a businessman?

18:51.755 --> 18:53.549
You say that like
it's suspicious.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.051
People aren't what they seem.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.219
Mm, right about that.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.097
You know, people here,

19:00.139 --> 19:01.849
they're all running
from something,

19:01.890 --> 19:04.184
trying to find
themselves out here.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.603
Maybe that's why they
call it Independence.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.148
And what are you running from?

19:09.189 --> 19:11.024
(indistinct chatter)

19:11.066 --> 19:13.026
Kate Carver.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.280

19:19.616 --> 19:21.827
Half the town will be there.
You should, uh, you should come.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.038
-I don't have
a place to stay. I...
-I do.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.833
It's upstairs.
Rent's cheap.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.127
Well, until the sheriff
hikes the prices.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.753
You know, he did ask Kai

19:31.795 --> 19:33.589
to do his laundry for free
the other day.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.174
Who's Kai?

19:35.924 --> 19:37.134
Hi, honey.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.844
Kai does the hotel laundry.

the railroads.

learn enough English
