00:12.900 --> 00:19.000
In the beginning there
was only darkness.

00:19.300 --> 00:22.700
And in the darkness was
born the demon Zaal,

00:22.800 --> 00:25.200
Ruler of the Underworld

00:25.300 --> 00:30.300
and the oppressor of humans.

00:32.299 --> 00:37.300
But from the shadows came Crane,
the warrior of warriors

00:37.400 --> 00:42.400
and bearer of the God Sword.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.200
He liberated man

00:50.800 --> 00:55.400
and led them to victory.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.600
But the price of victory was high.

01:25.700 --> 01:28.800
For Crane suffered a wound
through the heart,

01:28.900 --> 01:33.000
which bled for seven days
and seven nights.

01:33.100 --> 01:38.500
And a hundred warriors
drank his blood.

01:38.600 --> 01:43.400
And were given his strength.

01:48.900 --> 01:53.800
And Crane looked at them
and saw that all was good.

01:53.900 --> 01:57.600
And then he died.

01:59.900 --> 02:03.400
Thus, the barbarians were created,

02:03.500 --> 02:07.100
Sons of Crane.

02:38.300 --> 02:41.200
Oh, yeah.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.400
Yes.

03:06.100 --> 03:11.300
Listen, guys.
Strength! Courage! Fearlessness!

03:11.400 --> 03:15.300
That is what
Crane gave to our people.

03:15.400 --> 03:19.100
For thousands of generations,
generation after generation,

03:19.200 --> 03:22.600
his blood has rushed
undiluted through our veins.

03:22.700 --> 03:27.200
This is what we celebrate every year,
before we go on quests.

03:27.300 --> 03:31.000
But first and foremost
is the blood of Crane, that makes us,

03:31.100 --> 03:35.800
the barbarians,
the greatest warriors throughout Metalonia.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.600
Okay, Ronal, it's your turn.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.600
Ronal is sick...

03:41.700 --> 03:44.200
Ronal is sick today.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.900
Ronal!

03:47.200 --> 03:50.300
Can't you pass over me?
I have a sore elbow.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.800
Maybe I'm getting
dry skin... or...

03:53.900 --> 03:58.700
- Joint Inflammation.
- Dammit, Ronal.

03:58.800 --> 04:03.800
Put all your strength into it.

04:04.500 --> 04:09.300
I'm looking
forward to this.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.900
Oh, for God's sake, Ronal, man.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.600
One.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.200
Can't...

04:38.300 --> 04:40.300
...do...

04:40.400 --> 04:42.700
...more!

04:42.800 --> 04:45.600
You must get
in shape before the quest.

04:45.700 --> 04:49.400
A barbarian who can't
swing an ax, is... uh...

04:49.500 --> 04:51.900
Anyway, not a real barbarian.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.300
What do I need to quest for?
I'll just get in the way.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.400
- Can't I hang out here?
- You are a Son of Crane.

04:58.500 --> 05:03.000
A Son of Crane goes on quests and
kills monsters and returns in glory.

05:03.100 --> 05:07.700
- It is the essence of being a barbarian.
- Uncle, look at me.

05:07.800 --> 05:14.000
What should I do to monsters? Buckle on a
muscle suit and hope they die of laughter?

05:14.100 --> 05:18.100
What then, Ronal?
Have you got any better ideas?

05:18.200 --> 05:21.600
Fucking funny. Have you got
any brain cells?

05:21.700 --> 05:27.100
What? Where? If there is one on my back,
can you press it out?

05:27.200 --> 05:31.600
Listen here, kid. When you go on quests,
it is more about big balls

05:31.700 --> 05:34.400
not arms. Heroism.

05:34.500 --> 05:39.400
Once you've grasped it, you'll have
no problem crushing the enemy.

05:39.500 --> 05:44.300
I just find it hard to overlook,
that we can die!

05:44.400 --> 05:48.700
Just shut up and train.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.800
What is it?

06:08.600 --> 06:15.400
The alarm. Everyone to arms!
At your posts! Move!

06:15.500 --> 06:18.500
- Get to it!
- Yes, yes!

06:18.600 --> 06:22.500
Barricade the gate!

06:25.700 --> 06:29.100
Come on! Pull!

06:30.800 --> 06:36.200
Up on the barricades, stand ready!

06:42.100 --> 06:44.700
Quiet.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.500
Wait.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.900
Quiet!

07:01.500 --> 07:04.700
Who's there?

07:09.700 --> 07:13.500
Hail, noble barbarians.
We are Master Florian,

07:13.600 --> 07:16.000
a bard and our music.

07:16.100 --> 07:19.700
We simply want,
for humble payment, of course,

07:19.800 --> 07:24.900
to enrich your banquet
and your spectacular muscles

07:25.000 --> 07:32.400
with noble sonatas of your past
heroes and heroines.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.900
Attack!

07:49.000 --> 07:53.200
- Songs. They sing songs at feasts.
- Feasts?

07:53.300 --> 07:57.900
Check out their incredibly
dangerous tuba on the roof.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.700
Let them in.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.600
- No!
- Damn.

08:01.700 --> 08:06.600
It's a bloody hundred years ago,
since I last split some skulls.

08:06.700 --> 08:12.800
How the hell should I know
it was a tuba?

08:15.900 --> 08:19.200
Yo, girls. How about
you wash my sick, virile,

08:19.300 --> 08:21.900
resilient, filthy

08:22.000 --> 08:24.100
awesome lute?

08:24.200 --> 08:28.500
There shall be only practice, nothing frivolous,
young Alibert. The art calls.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.200
We have to be ready.

08:30.300 --> 08:34.500
Isn't there just a little bit of time
to walk around and look?

08:34.600 --> 08:39.000
A true bard
remembers all the songs perfectly.

08:39.100 --> 08:42.900
How perfect does it need to be?
Shouldn't we be on quests?

08:43.000 --> 08:46.200
The barbarians are leaving tomorrow.
We could go with them.

08:46.300 --> 08:49.800
Go with the flow.
I have to meet girls, man.

08:49.900 --> 08:53.100
Maybe,
write some heroic poem.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.700
Or something like that,
You know, with those verses.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.400
Oh, young Alibert.
Only when you learn all the songs,

09:00.500 --> 09:03.100
can you make that kind of poem.

09:03.200 --> 09:08.700
- What? That'll take a hundred years.
- Nonsense. It won't take that long.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.200
I was only 57 when I finished
my apprenticeship.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.700
Ouch! Fucking great.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.200
Can Rikke, can Rikke,
can Rikke drink beer?

09:19.300 --> 09:25.600
Can Rikke,
can Rikke, can Rikke drink beer?

09:26.700 --> 09:30.300
Oh, it's good, man.

09:30.400 --> 09:38.700
Can any one of you little children
guzzle a small pint of beer?

09:39.400 --> 09:41.900
Alibert!

09:42.000 --> 09:44.200
So I was on the hunt

09:44.300 --> 09:48.400
and then I just run into
an ork and killed it.

09:48.500 --> 09:52.400
- Here you go, honey. Wear it.
- Oh, how cute.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.300
Yes, it brings out your eyes.
You have to see this too.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.800
This is a real
invisibility lotion.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.100
I used it,
when I snuck into a harem.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.900
Cool, right? Total chick magnet.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.500
So you can't see
who is attacking you.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.800
What was that? Hey, there it is again.
And now it stopped.

10:12.900 --> 10:16.600
- There it is again.
- Ouch, Gorak. Let me be.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.700
- It will not stop.
- For God's sake, stop it!

10:20.800 --> 10:24.800
Oh, Ronal, damn man.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.900
All sons of Crane are here,
Prince Volcazar.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.500
Then it's time.

11:24.400 --> 11:28.800
- Can I take the watch for a bit?
- What about the feast?

11:28.900 --> 11:32.300
I'm just kind of... a little tired.

11:32.400 --> 11:36.800
Okay, then. Remember to blow the horn,
if you see something suspicious.

11:36.900 --> 11:41.000
- Do you think you can handle that?
- I'm not an idiot.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.100
- I want to be alone.
- It's a large horn.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.800
Remember, breathe in.
Deep down in the stomach. And...

11:48.900 --> 11:52.800
Damn, Uncle.
Who would attack us?

11:52.900 --> 11:56.700
We're fucking barbarians.
We smash everything.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.500
- We've never been attacked.
- That may well be.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.900
But it's the principle,
which is important.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.800
That boy will be the end of me one day.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.500
QUEST-MAGAZINE

12:13.600 --> 12:18.000
Fucking barbarians, man.

12:31.300 --> 12:35.500
What the hell is this?

13:07.900 --> 13:14.200
We're being attacked?
We're being attacked!

13:14.800 --> 13:18.500
Get your weapons!

13:26.300 --> 13:28.500
No, no!

13:28.600 --> 13:35.200
- We're ready to attack!
- Let hell rain down.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.700
Fuck! Fuck!

13:41.500 --> 13:44.000
Fire!

13:47.100 --> 13:51.300
Attack! Show no mercy!

13:54.900 --> 14:00.800
- Look! Fireworks!
- Did we order that?

14:10.300 --> 14:13.800
We're being attacked!
Barbarians, defend yourselves!

14:13.900 --> 14:17.300
Hup, hup, hup!

14:23.200 --> 14:26.600
Oh, thank heavens.
They're saved.

14:26.700 --> 14:32.300
This is a mad, fucking sick party, man.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.900
- Bummer!
- No!

14:37.800 --> 14:40.900
Help! Help!

14:57.100 --> 15:00.100
Punch! Smack!

15:00.200 --> 15:03.600
Bash! Muscles!

15:18.300 --> 15:21.500
I don't think
there are any more.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.900
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
He's mine.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.300
We're done for.
Why didn't you blow the horn?

15:35.400 --> 15:37.900
- I tried!
- You tried?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.300
"Trying" isn't good enough, Ronal.

15:41.400 --> 15:46.800
Get up. We must rescue the others.

16:00.900 --> 16:05.000
The famous sons of Crane.

16:05.100 --> 16:08.400
How pathetic.

16:09.500 --> 16:15.500
Put them in chains.
Leave no one behind.

16:18.100 --> 16:23.700
We Barbarians shall never surrender!

16:47.600 --> 16:52.200
Everyone must bow to me...

16:53.800 --> 16:55.500
No!

16:55.600 --> 16:57.500
...or die!

16:57.600 --> 16:59.900
No!

17:00.100 --> 17:04.400
- Take them away.
- You heard Prince Volcazar!

17:04.500 --> 17:08.200
Get the last barbarians in the cart.
Come on!

17:08.300 --> 17:11.099
Put him in! Move!

17:11.200 --> 17:13.900
- Come here!
- No, I won't...

17:14.000 --> 17:16.900
- In with them!
- What the hell?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.500
Remember your shoes and bags... axes!

17:19.599 --> 17:22.200
We will not come back
and get them!

17:22.300 --> 17:25.700
General? This prisoner
doesn't fit in the shackles.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.800
- Should I just throw him away?
- That's not a barbarian.

17:29.900 --> 17:34.000
- Drag him over there and kill him.
- Oh, thank you.

17:34.100 --> 17:37.200
- Lucky son of a bitch.
- He's always the one who get to do it.

17:37.300 --> 17:42.000
- Kicking ass feels good
- Kicking ass feels good

17:42.100 --> 17:47.500
- as a bonus, it is really nice
- as a bonus, it is really nice

17:47.600 --> 17:51.600
sits well
feels good

17:53.300 --> 17:58.100
No, I can't die. Help! Help!

18:05.400 --> 18:10.700
Shut up,
this is really exciting.

18:12.300 --> 18:16.100
Oh, man. Shit, it's night, man.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.900
My head, man.
The town is torn up, what happened?

18:20.000 --> 18:23.300
Where did everyone go?

18:23.400 --> 18:30.000
Did they go to the afterparty?
Hey, you, wait!

18:43.200 --> 18:46.400
Ro... Ronal.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.700
Uncle. You're alive.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.900
Not for long.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.400
Crane... calls to me.

18:55.500 --> 19:00.100
No, uncle,
it's probably just a... flesh wound.

19:00.200 --> 19:04.600
Ronal when your parents died,
I swore to take care of you.

19:04.700 --> 19:10.200
And I've kept that promise. But now
it's your turn to promise something.

19:10.300 --> 19:15.000
Promise me that you will save the others.
You owe it to them.

19:15.100 --> 19:19.200
- What? I can't save them.
- Promise me!

19:19.300 --> 19:23.600
- But...
- Travel north to the oracle.

19:23.700 --> 19:29.100
- He will help you.
- Oracle? How?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.900
You are our only hope, Ronal.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.700
The last of the barbarians.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.100
Uncle? Uncle?

19:48.100 --> 19:50.700
Uncle?

20:11.600 --> 20:16.400
Gorak's invisibility lotion.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.200
Yo.

20:19.300 --> 20:24.200
- What happened? Going on a quest?
- Uh, no. I must find the others.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.300
Well, okay.

20:26.400 --> 20:31.200
- It's a quest. You are going on a quest!
- No. I have to find my people.

20:31.300 --> 20:34.300
Awesome, this is a quest.
Wait a minute.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.800
- Who are you?
- Hey. Alibert, the bard.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.500
Damn nice to be joining you.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.800
You can't say no;
I'll just follow you anyway.

20:44.900 --> 20:49.100
Now we are on our way, shall we
go through the Amazon land?

20:49.200 --> 20:53.000
- No.
- The girls down there would be lovely.

20:53.100 --> 20:56.200
- We should investigate.
- Listen to me.

20:56.300 --> 21:00.500
- Don't follow me.
- Those girls are super horny.

21:00.600 --> 21:05.300
- No!
- Fuck, you're boring, man.

21:05.400 --> 21:10.100
Now I know where we're going. We're headed
to Berylia. They have ladies with tails.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.300
And four breasts! This could be
awesome, man!

21:13.400 --> 21:18.000
- No, it's not.
- Come on. Why are we here?

21:18.100 --> 21:26.500
- I need to talk to an oracle.
- Is that a kind of travel agent?

21:27.500 --> 21:30.500
Sick crib.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.900
Hello?

21:42.600 --> 21:45.800
- Hello?
- It's about time.

21:45.900 --> 21:49.400
I've been sitting here since last Wednesday.
Are you coming or what?

21:49.500 --> 21:54.400
- Sorry, what?
- Heck, I need to be wiped.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.800
You aren't the home care?

21:56.900 --> 22:00.800
- No, we...
- Wait!

22:01.400 --> 22:05.300
Gundar has sent me...

22:05.400 --> 22:14.300
That's it. You came just in time.
And be careful with my hemorrhoids.

22:18.300 --> 22:23.100
He is a mighty warlord,
this Prince Volcazar, that you're talking about.

22:23.200 --> 22:28.700
dark forces from the
underworld protect him.

22:28.800 --> 22:33.600
I'm not really
interested in fighting with him.

22:33.700 --> 22:37.500
Volcazar is looking for power
throughout Metalonia.

22:37.600 --> 22:43.300
So far, no one has
been able to stop him.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.800
Wow.

23:08.800 --> 23:16.000
He wears an impenetrable armor over
his body. No weapon can harm him.

23:16.100 --> 23:20.100
Only one sword has the strength
to crush him.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.800
Watch.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
- Oh, sick.
- What's so special about it?

23:35.100 --> 23:44.700
It should especially be known to you, barbarian.
This is the sword of Crane.

23:46.200 --> 23:50.300
That's a joke, right?

23:50.700 --> 23:55.000
Honestly, it doesn't exist.
Everybody has been looking for the damn sword

23:55.100 --> 23:58.500
for thousands of years,
and no one has found it.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.200
It's just a silly story.

24:01.300 --> 24:06.300
Crane's sword is not a myth.
Only it can damage Prince Volcazar.

24:06.400 --> 24:10.700
You can never save your people
without killing him first.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.400
But I can't.

24:12.500 --> 24:17.400
Only a great warrior without fear
in his heart will be able to use it.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.800
Without a great warrior
you will not defeat Volcazar.

24:20.900 --> 24:28.000
And without a great warrior
your people are damned!

24:29.600 --> 24:33.600
But I could be wrong.
I'm just an oracle.

24:33.700 --> 24:41.300
It's not your fault the
barbarians were captured, is it?

25:25.400 --> 25:28.300
Gu'ra zul!

25:28.400 --> 25:30.800
Wizard!

25:30.900 --> 25:35.400
Lord, time is fast approaching. The resurrection
at the underworld temple must begin soon.

25:35.500 --> 25:39.900
Otherwise it will be impossible to carry out
the ritual. Have we caught the sons of Crane?

25:40.000 --> 25:45.400
- The mission is complete.
- Fantastic. Now nothing can stop us.

25:45.500 --> 25:50.300
Mighty Zaal. The sons
of Crane are assembled.

25:50.400 --> 25:54.700
Awake from your slumber!

25:54.800 --> 25:57.500
What is happening?

25:57.600 --> 26:00.400
Finally.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.800
- What?
- What now?

26:12.900 --> 26:17.300
The mighty Zaal is not satisfied.
We're missing a Son of Crane.

26:17.400 --> 26:21.600
- Impossible. Unless...
- I don't understand...

26:21.700 --> 26:24.700
- We left none alive.
- Fool!

26:24.800 --> 26:30.200
I need the blood of all living
barbarians, and you let one escape.

26:30.300 --> 26:36.700
- I don't understand.
- Find him for me. Now!

26:36.800 --> 26:40.800
for they are on a quest,
Alibert and Ronal

26:40.900 --> 26:45.600
the greatest heroes
in Metalonia

26:45.700 --> 26:50.300
ooh-ooh
it's going so well

26:51.600 --> 26:54.100
and the girls they say

26:54.200 --> 26:57.000
Alibert
you're so sexy

26:57.100 --> 27:02.700
My village has been burned,
and I must find the sword of Crane.

27:02.800 --> 27:08.800
Can't you be quiet, for God's sake,
just five minutes, so I can think?

27:08.900 --> 27:13.400
- I'll sing a barbarian song instead.
- For God's sake, no.

27:13.500 --> 27:18.000
and Crane drew his proud sword
and drove with all his force

27:18.100 --> 27:21.500
the blade deep in Zaal
and Zaal's skull burst

27:21.600 --> 27:24.900
Wait a minute. The song.
What was it?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.100
"The Epic of Crane".

27:27.200 --> 27:30.900
There are 2073 verses,
and I know them all by heart.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.800
Crane gets tons of pussy.

27:33.900 --> 27:37.500
- Why didn't you say this before?
- That he gets pussy?

27:37.600 --> 27:40.700
No, about the song. It's about Crane.

27:40.800 --> 27:46.400
You just sang a verse about his sword.
Is there one that says where it is?

27:46.500 --> 27:51.000
from the chest of Crane the blood flowed
it bled day and night

27:51.100 --> 27:53.700
No no. After he dies. Come on. Sing.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.500
in his tomb was placed the sword
the place is now forgotten

27:57.600 --> 28:02.100
only the Book of Wisdom in Elfland
knows where it is stored

28:02.200 --> 28:05.600
The Book of Wisdom in Elfland.
That's it.

28:05.700 --> 28:08.300
- We need to go to Elfland.
- What do you think?

28:08.400 --> 28:12.600
- This is how we find the sword!
- Elf girls are crazy sexy.

28:12.700 --> 28:16.000
This will be a great quest.

28:16.100 --> 28:21.000
Okay, I have two rules for the
quest. One: This is not a quest.

28:21.100 --> 28:27.300
And two: we see something that is even
the least bit unsafe, we go around.

28:27.400 --> 28:32.100
- Is that a deal?
- Got it.

28:38.200 --> 28:43.300
Is it rule number one or two,
that we just violated?

28:43.400 --> 28:46.600
Run for your life.

28:46.700 --> 28:51.600
Shit! What the hell happened?

28:57.800 --> 29:02.100
What the hell did this?

29:14.100 --> 29:16.800
No! No!

29:18.800 --> 29:21.300
Ouch!

29:25.800 --> 29:29.700
- Who are you? Are you one of them?
- My... my neck.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.100
Answer me!

29:32.200 --> 29:36.000
I'm just a random
passer-by. I swear.

29:36.100 --> 29:39.600
It was not my intention
to disturb you in the middle of your...

29:39.700 --> 29:44.600
- Slaughter of random men.
- They challenged me to a duel.

29:44.700 --> 29:48.400
Oh no, not again.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.500
Get out of here.
I'll let you live.

30:00.600 --> 30:04.400
She is like, the warrior,
we need for the sword of Crane.

30:04.500 --> 30:08.400
What? Are you insane?
She is a fucking violent psychopath.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.600
- Yes, exactly. Ask her.
- No.

30:11.700 --> 30:16.600
Wanker. Yo, beautiful. My friend Ronal
would like to ask you something.

30:16.700 --> 30:19.600
We could use a killer like you

30:19.700 --> 30:23.900
on our quest, you know.
In order to save his people.

30:24.000 --> 30:30.700
And as a little bonus, I would
let you play on my lute.

30:30.800 --> 30:33.900
I don't know what he's talking about.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.700
put your hand on my lute
and let me teach you to suck

30:38.800 --> 30:42.200
I don't want to learn to play
your instrument.

30:42.300 --> 30:46.400
- You are extremely uptight.
- I said it wasn't a good idea.

30:46.500 --> 30:49.100
Another must rescue the barbarians.

30:49.200 --> 30:53.000
- Did you say barbarians?
- Um, yes.

30:53.100 --> 30:56.500
- The barbarians, those are your people?
- Uh, of course.

30:56.600 --> 31:00.700
Those, that they say,
are the greatest warriors in Metalonia?

31:00.800 --> 31:03.200
Yes.

31:03.800 --> 31:07.400
That's a worthy cause.
I'll go with you.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.100
What?

31:09.200 --> 31:12.400
I'm Zandra from the shield maiden clan.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.100
- Where are you headed?
- Elfland.

31:15.200 --> 31:18.400
- We need to find out where it is.
- We will need a guide.

31:18.500 --> 31:22.800
- There is a town nearby. Come.
- No, wait. You can't just...

31:22.900 --> 31:27.500
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Now... uh, no.

31:27.600 --> 31:34.200
- Super. Come.
- I swear, you scored her, man.

31:43.600 --> 31:48.300
Son of Crane! Son of Crane!

31:49.100 --> 31:52.700
Come on! Faster!

32:09.600 --> 32:12.500
Oh, cool.

32:17.100 --> 32:24.900
Shave my legs and call me Susan,
if this is not the coolest place.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.100
- Okay, we're here.
- Uh, okay.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.600
What's up, assholes?

32:30.700 --> 32:34.600
Can I trouble one of you
to call me a taxi?

32:34.700 --> 32:37.700
- Fuck.
- Sweet. It's happy hour.

32:37.800 --> 32:41.300
There are a lot in there today.
Stay behind me.

32:41.400 --> 32:45.000
We'll enter quietly,
find a guide

32:45.100 --> 32:48.300
and then leave
before anyone notices us.

32:48.400 --> 32:53.000
And without a fight, okay?

32:53.700 --> 32:56.000
Please?

32:56.100 --> 33:00.800
- As you wish.
- Thank you.

33:02.800 --> 33:08.500
Bing, bing-li-bing-bing.
In your ass.

33:15.500 --> 33:18.900
Son of Crane! Son of Crane!

33:19.000 --> 33:23.800
So I said to her: "Your breasts
look tired. Should I hold them?"

33:23.900 --> 33:28.600
Your mother has always
had the largest tits.

33:28.700 --> 33:32.700
Hey! Hey! Stop that, buddy.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.900
I'll tell you.
She was angry, man.

33:36.000 --> 33:42.000
You can't win them all.
But you can try.

33:47.400 --> 33:53.000
- What do you want?
- We're looking for a guide.

33:53.100 --> 33:57.900
There is only one left. Down by the
bathroom. Ask for Elric.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.900
Hey, who ordered a pint
and a double Manhattan?

34:02.000 --> 34:05.300
Okay. Thanks.

34:11.300 --> 34:14.400
Uh, hey. Uh, are you Elric?

34:14.500 --> 34:18.600
The voice of the wind
lights the evening sun's embrace.

34:18.699 --> 34:23.300
Stellar Children,
great Mother Sun now rests.

34:23.400 --> 34:28.900
The darkness comes as a
pensive sigh.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
I sensed you would come. We
elves are connected with all living things.

34:33.100 --> 34:37.000
Let our souls meet.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.500
You bear the dreams of an eagle
and the will of a mouse.

34:41.600 --> 34:46.699
Mighty blood dwells in your heart.
Kormamin lindua ka'elja.

34:46.800 --> 34:55.699
Yes, that sounds exciting. My name is
Ronal, and I have some place...

34:56.900 --> 35:00.000
Names have no meaning.

35:00.100 --> 35:05.100
- I need...
- Spiritual or physical guidance?

35:05.200 --> 35:07.600
We need to find Elfland.

35:07.700 --> 35:12.200
The wind's voice shall tell me,
whether I should help you. Stand still!

35:12.300 --> 35:18.400
Let me penetrate your aura.
Kormamin lindua ka'elja.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.300
Kormamin lindua...

35:21.400 --> 35:29.000
The wind says, I shall follow you.
My bow will sing with your sword.

35:29.100 --> 35:31.800
Okay...

35:34.100 --> 35:36.600
Damn.

35:36.700 --> 35:40.500
- Hey, I found him.
- My bow will sing with your sword.

35:40.600 --> 35:45.800
Yes. Come, let's get out of here.

35:45.900 --> 35:49.400
Hey, shield maiden,
you're leaving already?

35:49.500 --> 35:54.900
What do you say to a little dance?

35:59.000 --> 36:03.900
Hey, guys, sorry,
we were just leaving.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
- I accept your challenge.
- What?

36:07.100 --> 36:09.500
He must defeat me or die.

36:09.600 --> 36:13.400
- We shouldn't create any problems.
- He challenged me.

36:13.500 --> 36:18.200
You promised. In and
out, without fighting.

36:18.300 --> 36:21.500
Okay. So, you take care of it yourself.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.900
Hey, shield maiden, what's it gonna be?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.100
Listen...

36:27.200 --> 36:31.600
Friend, I know,
it's super cool to fight,

36:31.700 --> 36:38.300
but we're in a bit of a hurry, and there
are probably plenty of others here who would fight,

36:38.400 --> 36:45.700
so if it's okay with you,
I think we'll just leave.

36:48.700 --> 36:54.100
- Zandra!
- Not supposed to fight.

36:55.700 --> 37:00.300
That'll make a nice soup base.

37:00.400 --> 37:03.800
Learn to ride!

37:07.600 --> 37:10.800
Have you seen this before?
I can teach you to play it.

37:10.900 --> 37:15.200
Does it make you horny?

37:16.700 --> 37:22.300
I sense
much aggression in the room.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.700
Any last words, chump?

37:26.800 --> 37:29.900
- He's dead.
- What the hell?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.800
I'm gonna make you pay
for throwing up on me.

37:32.900 --> 37:41.500
- Now you're gonna get a new asshole.
- That's enough. Let him be.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.900
Black Riders.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.200
Son of Crane! Son of Crane!

38:01.300 --> 38:05.600
- Take him!
- No! Help!

38:09.900 --> 38:12.600
Zandra!

38:13.000 --> 38:19.200
Nobody stands up to Prince
Volcazar's riders and lives!

38:19.300 --> 38:21.800
It's gonna explode!

38:21.900 --> 38:24.400
Move!

38:29.200 --> 38:33.800
Hey! Who is it that ordered
the double Manhattan?

38:33.900 --> 38:36.400
Ouch, my ass!

38:36.500 --> 38:37.700
110% ALCOHOL

38:37.800 --> 38:40.600
Goddamn!

38:52.900 --> 38:57.800
Fabulous, my lord. One more shot,
and then you've beaten the record.

38:57.900 --> 39:02.500
But we have to find the last
Son of Crane before the next full moon.

39:02.600 --> 39:09.300
- You're ruining my concentration.
- I'm sorry.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.500
- Hello?
- He escaped, sir.

39:13.600 --> 39:18.300
The task is more difficult than we thought.
He has the help of a strong warrior.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.100
We'll need reinforcements.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.900
I will not tolerate any more failures!

39:24.000 --> 39:29.100
Bring them to me. Both of them.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.500
Do you know where we are?
It seems like we're going in circles.

39:44.600 --> 39:49.100
The wind speaks to my soul.
We will soon be in the elvish realm.

39:49.200 --> 39:53.300
You said that two days ago.
We're lost, damn it.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.500
We're gonna die of thirst.

39:55.600 --> 39:58.600
- Ha.
- What's so funny?

39:58.700 --> 40:03.100
I have heard that barbarians are strong and
quick to fight, but you're neither.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.000
You just bitch and whine.

40:06.100 --> 40:09.700
It's really funny when you consider
the heritage you come from.

40:09.800 --> 40:13.500
Why are you with us
if you think all I do is whine?

40:13.600 --> 40:16.800
- What's your deal with the barbarians?
- None of your business.

40:16.900 --> 40:19.900
Stop! See.

40:23.900 --> 40:27.900
- And that means...?
- We elves can communicate with everything.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.800
I will unite myself with its soul
and get it to show us the way.

40:32.900 --> 40:37.300
Kormamin lindua ka'elja.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.400
Kormamin lindua...

40:43.500 --> 40:48.200
Ouch! My beautiful elf lip!

41:00.300 --> 41:07.800
There. On the other side. There is no
labyrinth on the other side.

41:07.900 --> 41:11.200
The entrance to Elfland.

41:11.300 --> 41:14.200
I did it.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.200
Elf gate, I greet you.

41:28.500 --> 41:33.300
You didn't know it was here?

41:52.800 --> 41:55.800
- Oh! Wild!
- Come on.

41:55.900 --> 42:03.100
Stop! First, our souls are weighed
by the Gate Keepers.

42:03.200 --> 42:07.500
Only those with the right character
may be allowed to go through.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.800
What about those
who do not have the right character?

42:10.900 --> 42:14.300
Who? Well.
They are crushed by the rock wall.

42:14.400 --> 42:17.900
- Well, shall we go?
- I can't.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.700
- What?
- I'm a miserable barbarian.

42:21.800 --> 42:24.600
I don't have
the right character.

42:24.700 --> 42:29.600
- You've misunderstood the meaning.
- Forget it. We'll go around.

42:29.700 --> 42:32.900
When you're on a quest,
follow the guide.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.800
The only thing we get out of that,
is being killed.

42:36.900 --> 42:41.200
But now you call it a quest,
so, remember that it is my quest.

42:41.300 --> 42:49.800
And I've decided that we go around
this ridiculous gate. Come on!

42:54.500 --> 42:58.500
See. No booby traps, no gates,
nothing.

42:58.600 --> 43:07.900
This quest-nonsense is so predictable.
If you just think a bit outside...

43:10.500 --> 43:14.100
- Ouch, my tailbone, man.
- What the hell was that?

43:14.200 --> 43:18.100
We have offended the Gate Keepers.
I sense...

43:18.200 --> 43:20.500
...great danger!

43:20.600 --> 43:23.000
Run!

43:28.500 --> 43:31.200
Faster!

43:33.700 --> 43:36.300
Ronal!

43:40.200 --> 43:42.700
Come!

43:49.900 --> 43:51.800
Ouch, man.

43:51.900 --> 43:55.700
Fool! Your stupid idea almost
got us all killed.

43:55.800 --> 44:00.200
I just tried
to steer us away from trouble.

44:00.300 --> 44:04.600
You tried? Well, "trying"
isn't good enough, Ronal.

44:04.700 --> 44:08.100
On any quest
there's bound to be problems.

44:08.200 --> 44:13.700
Solve them instead of going around.

44:22.300 --> 44:25.100
There's the Temple of the Elves.

44:25.200 --> 44:31.500
The focal point
of all wisdom in the world.

44:32.100 --> 44:37.100
The Book of Wisdom lies
in the tower's upper chamber

44:37.200 --> 44:41.000
so the moon can read
on his voyage across the night sky.

44:41.100 --> 44:44.200
It is the holiest of holy books.

44:44.300 --> 44:47.800
- Fair enough. So we'll just go on up and grab it.
- Quiet!

44:47.900 --> 44:50.400
Look.

44:51.200 --> 45:01.100
No one from the outside is allowed in. The King's
archers have eyes like hawks.

45:08.000 --> 45:14.000
- Shit.
- They kill everything they see.

45:22.700 --> 45:26.900
So we'll have to do it the hard way.
I'll take these two.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.300
No.

45:29.800 --> 45:32.100
- I'll do it.
- What?

45:32.200 --> 45:34.400
Alone.

45:34.500 --> 45:37.800
Think about it. They'll kill you,
as soon as they see you.

45:37.900 --> 45:40.100
I know,

45:40.200 --> 45:43.500
they're not going to see me.

45:43.600 --> 45:48.100
There isn't much left
and I'm the smallest. Wait here.

45:48.200 --> 45:52.300
I could have used
that in high school.

45:52.400 --> 45:57.600
How do I look? Invisible, right?

45:58.500 --> 46:03.300
- What?
- You missed a spot.

46:03.800 --> 46:07.000
Fuck! It's empty.
Fuck, so typical.

46:07.100 --> 46:11.700
Relax, Ronal. They're small dumplings,
nobody will notice.

46:11.800 --> 46:18.800
- Wait here.
- Good luck, Ronal. Don't get killed.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.100
Ouch!

46:22.200 --> 46:29.500
"I have a headache," "I'm tired"
"The kids will wake up!", and blah, blah, blah.

46:29.600 --> 46:32.300
Having such a wife is a bummer,
man.

46:32.400 --> 46:33.900
Bitch!

46:34.000 --> 46:35.400
Ouch!

46:35.500 --> 46:38.700
Who's there?

46:41.900 --> 46:44.900
Hmm, nothing there.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.500
- Where were we? Are you ready for this Saturday?
- Are you crazy? I was born ready!

46:49.600 --> 46:55.600
- Hell yeah!
- I must be a crazy psycho!

47:04.800 --> 47:08.000
That's open.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.700
Ouch!

47:28.300 --> 47:32.600
Fuck, I'm in bad shape.

47:51.200 --> 47:53.500
Oh!

47:59.500 --> 48:01.800
Ah!

48:07.700 --> 48:10.900
Cursed rats!

48:20.800 --> 48:23.100
Oh!

48:31.300 --> 48:35.000
Wow. There it is.

48:41.600 --> 48:44.700
So where is it?
Sword of Crane,

48:44.800 --> 48:50.500
Sword of Crane,
how the hell do I find the Sword of Crane?

48:50.600 --> 48:52.300
There it is.

48:52.400 --> 48:57.800
The Sword of Crane.
Well, that was easy enough.

48:57.900 --> 49:02.700
It's like no one
can see me.

49:05.700 --> 49:10.200
- A killer rat!
- Kill the rat!

49:10.300 --> 49:14.600
Use the poisoned arrows.

49:14.700 --> 49:17.600
After it!

49:17.700 --> 49:22.300
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

49:22.600 --> 49:26.600
Faster!
Shoot it down!

49:26.700 --> 49:32.500
- Ow, damn it!
- Yes! The pig is down!

49:40.900 --> 49:44.400
Well, how much
are you gonna drink?

49:44.500 --> 49:53.300
- Nothing. I'll smoke instead.
- Did you get Elrond's mother's weed?

50:13.700 --> 50:16.200
Ouch.

50:19.100 --> 50:25.100
The page says that Crane was
buried in the Eternal Mountain.

50:25.200 --> 50:28.700
My elfin soul feels,
that it is far, far away...

50:28.800 --> 50:31.100
Isn't that it right there?

50:31.200 --> 50:35.200
...that it is nearby.
Destiny is on our side.

50:35.300 --> 50:37.600
Ouch.

50:37.700 --> 50:40.500
No more.

50:42.100 --> 50:44.600
- I was wrong about you.
- What?

50:44.700 --> 50:47.700
There in the temple. You did it.

50:47.800 --> 50:52.600
Yes, more or less in any case.
You make the barbarians proud.

50:52.700 --> 50:55.800
Uh. Thanks.

50:56.600 --> 51:00.400
Well, um... I have to
polish my axe.

51:00.500 --> 51:03.000
I was thinking...

51:03.100 --> 51:06.700
I've never really said...

51:06.800 --> 51:10.500
...thank you for coming with me.

51:10.600 --> 51:14.800
Actually, I don't know how I would
have made it this far without you.

51:14.900 --> 51:18.000
Uh... okay.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.700
Well, we'd better get some sleep.
Maybe we'll find the Sword of Crane tomorrow.

51:24.800 --> 51:30.300
I'll keep watch. We elves need
no sleep. You can sleep safely.

51:30.400 --> 51:35.600
- Can I ask you something, Ronal?
- Uh, yes, of course.

51:35.700 --> 51:38.600
What are the barbarians like?

51:38.700 --> 51:42.500
- They're not very clever.
- I thought more...

51:42.600 --> 51:46.800
What are they like in here?

51:46.900 --> 51:49.400
Well.

51:49.600 --> 51:51.400
Uh.

51:51.500 --> 51:56.500
A barbarian is always ready to help
those that need it.

51:56.600 --> 52:01.200
Regardless of how dangerous or difficult
it is. And they go on quests all the time.

52:01.300 --> 52:06.500
They're not afraid of anything.
Hard to believe I'm one of them, right?

52:06.600 --> 52:11.700
- And they're great warriors?
- Yep. The best in the world.

52:11.800 --> 52:15.500
It's just so difficult
to find a proper warrior.

52:15.600 --> 52:18.000
Yeah. Uh, what?

52:18.100 --> 52:22.000
I come from
an ancient clan of shield maidens.

52:22.100 --> 52:26.200
Far, far away from here.

52:26.300 --> 52:35.400
Our religion requires that I only
marry the warrior that can defeat me.

52:35.700 --> 52:38.700
Many have tried
to defeat me

52:38.800 --> 52:41.100
but I'm too strong.

52:41.200 --> 52:45.600
And for every duel I won,
I just got stronger.

52:45.700 --> 52:49.900
Meanwhile, I could only watch as
the others found themselves a mate.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.400
One by one. Eventually I was
the only one left.

52:54.500 --> 52:59.100
It took longer and longer
for anyone to challenge me.

52:59.200 --> 53:03.300
Then the suitors just
stopped coming.

53:03.400 --> 53:06.700
The head of the clan
became impatient.

53:06.800 --> 53:12.100
They told me to go forth, into
the world, to find a worthy husband.

53:12.200 --> 53:17.900
A warrior with the strength
to defeat me.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.100
If I am defeated, I must
obey his slightest command.

53:22.200 --> 53:25.300
There have been none,
who are strong enough.

53:25.400 --> 53:30.500
But everywhere I've been, it is said,
barbarians are the strongest warriors,

53:30.600 --> 53:34.100
so maybe a barbarian from
your village can defeat me.

53:34.200 --> 53:38.000
- That's why I went with you.
- Uh... Okay.

53:38.100 --> 53:40.500
- Okay, what?
- Well, that's...

53:40.600 --> 53:44.700
What you just said,
what does it have to do with love?

53:44.800 --> 53:51.000
It will be love that defeats me.
I've waited so long.

53:51.100 --> 53:53.500
Wow.

53:54.300 --> 53:59.100
I've never
told this to anyone before.

53:59.200 --> 54:03.200
It feels so... nice.

54:10.200 --> 54:16.800
You know what, Ronal? It's actually
nice talking to you.

54:16.900 --> 54:19.000
You're so lovely.

54:19.100 --> 54:22.500
- Uh, to talk with, I mean.
- Well.

54:22.600 --> 54:27.900
And if I had meant it the
other way, we'd have to fight.

54:28.000 --> 54:37.300
- No, I wouldn't be so fortunate.
- Yeah, that would be a little strange.

54:37.600 --> 54:40.100
- What was that?
- I don't know.

54:40.200 --> 54:43.300
Hey, Elric.

54:45.800 --> 54:48.500
Elves do not sleep.

54:48.600 --> 54:57.300
- What is it, what's making that sound?
- I sense a terrible voice.

54:59.500 --> 55:03.600
No one escapes
Prince Volcazar's anger!

55:03.700 --> 55:07.400
Ronal, watch out!

55:07.900 --> 55:10.600
Zandra!

55:15.400 --> 55:20.500
- Curses!
- Ronal, wait for me!

55:29.600 --> 55:32.200
Ronal!

55:32.500 --> 55:35.400
Oh, fuck!

55:51.800 --> 55:54.300
Shit!

55:57.900 --> 55:59.800
They're gone.

55:59.900 --> 56:03.600
Damn! Let's move!

56:04.500 --> 56:07.200
Zandra!

56:09.000 --> 56:11.900
- No, no, no.
- We'll find her.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.700
If we go now,
we can find them. Come.

56:18.800 --> 56:24.200
- What did you do?
- It wasn't me.

56:27.100 --> 56:30.300
The Amazons.

56:48.500 --> 56:51.900
- It stuck.
- Congratulations, honey.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.500
...can't get too much sun.

56:56.600 --> 57:00.100
See my new shoes.
Aren't they fantastic?

57:00.200 --> 57:05.700
- It's only women.
- I've died and gone to heaven.

57:05.800 --> 57:10.100
- Hey, girls. What's going on?
- What's that?

57:10.200 --> 57:18.400
- Oh, totally botched stomach pouch.
- Hello. Good to see you.

57:24.400 --> 57:28.000
High Queen, we've captured
these women in the jungle.

57:28.100 --> 57:32.600
We have brought them to you,
so you can decide their fate.

57:32.700 --> 57:37.300
Stand them up. Let me see.

57:49.200 --> 57:53.700
What remarkable women.
I've never seen anything like it.

57:53.800 --> 57:56.700
- What's this?
- Ow!

57:56.800 --> 58:00.900
- One even has hair on his chin.
- How clumsy!

58:01.000 --> 58:04.800
- High Queen.
- Quiet, ugly girl.

58:04.900 --> 58:09.100
- Who asked you to speak?
- We're not women.

58:09.200 --> 58:14.000
- Well, we're men, you know?
- Men?

58:14.100 --> 58:18.300
- Or nearly so.
- Men?

58:20.900 --> 58:30.000
Heaven be praised. The gods have heard
our prayers and sent us two men.

58:30.100 --> 58:34.300
Finally, the time has come,
when we can grow our tribe.

58:34.400 --> 58:38.800
Take them to the sacred mating cabins.

58:38.900 --> 58:42.400
- What?
- What!

58:48.500 --> 58:52.800
We'll take the thin one first.
And save him for tomorrow.

58:52.900 --> 58:57.100
No, help.
No, I won't!

58:57.700 --> 59:02.200
Honestly, man. Why can't it be me.
I'd be more than willing to do it.

59:02.300 --> 59:06.700
That's so fucking typical.

59:06.800 --> 59:09.100
No!

59:16.800 --> 59:19.800
- Lord.
- You have them?

59:19.900 --> 59:27.800
We have caught the warrior who
helped the barbarian escape.

59:38.300 --> 59:41.400
Let me see.

59:42.600 --> 59:45.600
A shield maiden.

59:45.700 --> 59:51.200
- And a very sexy one.
- Give me a weapon and let me fight.

59:51.300 --> 59:54.100
In time.

59:56.400 --> 59:59.500
No one lays a hand on
me without suffering.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.800
So die then!

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:50.800
Impressive.
You are my type of woman.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:55.900
Too bad I have to
to kill you!

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.000
What?

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.200
Foolish woman.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:50.200
I know your rules, shield maiden.
You must obey me now.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.200
It is your destiny.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:57.400
You have defeated me.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.200
Single piercing is not cool.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:09.100
Double piercing is the shit.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.400
Yes! It's about time.
Is it my turn?

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.600
The ceremony is over.
We will use you tomorrow.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:27.000
- What? Tomorrow?
- It's the Queen's order.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:32.200
Come back!
I want to be abused!

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:38.500
- Did you remember to lock the door?
- Of course.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.800
Hey, what are you doing?

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:46.600
- We have to leave.
- What about all the Amazons?

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.500
Zandra is in danger. We must find
the Sword of Crane and help her.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.200
- That can wait a week.
- We can't leave her behind.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:58.100
- We can find another warrior?
- I want Zandra!

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.600
Hey, you didn't want
her help to start with.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.500
Fuck you! I'll be right here
making sweet love with hot babes.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.100
That's the only reason
I came on this quest.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:17.200
Oh, I forgot. You're not
on a quest. You're just fucking boring.

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.900
Fine. Stay here.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:26.800
You're not
any damn help anyway.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:40.400
Oh, I just love that song.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.700
Damn! Fucking shit!

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:07.300
Oh, what the fuck am I doing, man?
Ronal, I'm coming.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:19.000
- Madam Queen?
- I just had to see you.

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:24.200
Ever since I saw you the first time,
my body trembles with longing.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.600
I know it's against the rules,
but I must have you.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:33.600
- If I may...
- I cannot control myself. Take me!

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:37.400
Take me! Oh! Yes!

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.300
Take me!

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.800
Stop!

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:52.100
Unfortunately I can't, Madam Queen.
My friend needs me.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.300
What?

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.900
Perhaps I can be taken
prisoner again on the way back.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.600
Alarm!

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.400
- Pigs! Men are pigs!
- Insane bitches, man!

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:16.500
- He was your responsibility!
- And I locked the door!

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:21.000
Hang him from his balls!

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.600
Elric?

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:42.900
It's the first barbarians.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.600
Wow.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.800
Hello.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:06.400
I need your sword.
I'll take good care of it.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:15.400
That was easy. Wow.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.600
Yeah. I apologize.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.600
Zandra.

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.500
I'm sorry.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.300
Time after time you escaped
my best riders, barbarian.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:51.300
And then we find you up here, just as
my shield maiden said we would.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.200
The Sword of Crane. The only weapon
in the world that can harm you.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.900
Zandra?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.300
Excellent. You've served me well.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:10.400
- As you have commanded me, lord.
- What the hell is going on?

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:17.899
Lets move! We have to get this
barbarian to my wizard.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:40.000
I sense,
that Ronal is in great danger.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:48.500
- Do what you must, wizard.
- With pleasure, Lord.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.300
- Ronal?
- Gorak?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.700
- Here he is.
- No, no, no!

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:17.300
Finally! Mighty Zaal,
listen to your humble servant!

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:21.300
The blood has been collected
from the Sons of Crane.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:26.500
Grant us access to your temple!

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.200
What are you doing?

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:42.000
Only once every ten thousand years, is it
possible for Zaal, ruler of the underworld,

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:49.300
to come to our world.
I offer the ultimate sacrifice.

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:54.800
The sons of the warrior, who sent
him from this world.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:10:00.800
And as a reward he will bestow upon me
his divine power.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:04.900
All will bow to me

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.900
or die!

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:25.800
Shit. We can't go any further
without being noticed.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.200
Ronal!

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:09.800
What the hell's the matter with you?
Come on! Lift your feet!

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:13.400
Come on! Get up the stairs!

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.500
Wait here.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.200
- Ronal.
- Alibert!

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.500
- What?
- Take it easy.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:29.600
Keep moving, you wretch.

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.700
Ronal, where's the
Sword of Crane?

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:42.000
There's nothing you can do. It's
on the altar below. Get away from here.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:04.200
I will not be satisfied,
until they scream like the pigs they are!

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.400
Mighty Zaal we give to you the
blood from the Sons of Crane.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:14.200
Let your darkness bless us.

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.400
Soon I will be mightier than a god

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:25.100
and you shall be my queen
in the after life.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.600
Hey! What are you doing here?

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:41.700
- Uh...
- Kill him.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.700
No, wait. I am master Alibert.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:48.200
The bard!

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:53.400
I'm here to play at
the feast... the occult ritual.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:56.900
Here's a song you might know.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.400
your muscles
they make me crazy

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:04.000
on the dance floor
you can see it

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.100
your skull charm
it makes me hot

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:12.100
little cuddles
sweet treasure

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.500
- Shut up, that's crap.
- Oh!

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:22.400
- Later.
- Come back, you little shit!

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.800
Let the Chosen One step forward!

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.700
- Hey, Ronal.
- The Sword of Crane.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.700
- I'll get you free.
- We must liberate the others.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:52.700
- I'm hurrying as fast as I can.
- What the hell?

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.500
Drop it, pip-squeak.
You don't have a chance.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:05.800
Come on. Give me your best shot.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.500
Very nice. It was really...

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:23.000
- What the hell?
- Sorry.

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:25.600
What?

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:46.300
I've totally been
looking forward to this!

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.800
Oh yeah!

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.900
- Kill them.
- But...

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.400
- That's an order!
- Zandra!

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:10.500
You belong to me, shield maiden!
Don't forget.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.900
Yes, my Lord.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.500
- Ronal.
- You don't have to do this.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:31.900
Volcazar has defeated me in a duel.
It is my destiny.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.300
Zandra, it's me.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.500
This is completely ridiculous.
Is this really your destiny

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.700
to kill the only one,
who loves you, to death,

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:58.100
just because some maniac
has beaten you in a fight?

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.900
Watch out!

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.600
Ronal!

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.900
Zandra.

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.700
Let me go!

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:32.900
Lord, drink it up,
before it's too late.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:38.400
Clever Lord. Drink it all up.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.300
Oh, shit.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.200
Die!

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:56.000
No!

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:24.100
The darkness must be
awakened in Metalonia.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:29.300
The sound of screams
must rise to the sky.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.400
All must bow to me

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.400
or die!

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.300
Fuck!

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:04.400
The Epic of Crane! "Crane drew his proud sword
and drove with all his force

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:08.600
the blade deep in Zaal
and Zaal's skull burst."

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:16.100
You have to strike him in the forehead.
It is his weak point, man!

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:20.000
That's impossible!

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:28.500
There's nothing you can do here.
Save yourself!

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.900
- What?
- This is no place for you.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.800
Run!

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:38.500
No. I'm done
running away.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:47.400
Now you better behave yourself.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:54.800
Yes, do it! Stab him in the forehead!

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.900
- In the forehead.
- What do you think I'm trying to do?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.600
I'll crush you like a bug!

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.500
He's fucking dead.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.500
Oh, damn!

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:27.500
May my aim be sharp as a hawk's
and as perfect as the great breast.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.800
Stand still!

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:47.000
No!

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.700
Now I have you!

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.600
Eat lute, you bitch!

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.300
No, no. No!

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:35.200
- Zandra!
- My queen! Kill these fleas.

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:50.400
What are you doing? Your honor commands
you to serve me!

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.700
No! No more!

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.300
Then die!

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.200
Zandra!

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:15.900
Okay, guys, let's show them
how barbarians really fight!

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.400
Gorak!

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:31.400
- Come on, guys!
- Muscles!

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:38.000
I am invincible!

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:56.900
- What?
- This one's for Uncle Gundar!

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.100
Uh?

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:28.300
Holy shit.
My g-string is so high up my ass.

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.000
Ronal?

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.600
Ronal!

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.800
Oh no.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:05.400
Here lies Ronal.
The greatest barbarian of us all.

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:32.600
- What happened?
- Damn, he lives, man!

01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:38.000
I sense great love.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:42.000
It's so beautiful.

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.600
I haven't challenged you
to a duel, right?

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.300
You...

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:55.700
You have already
conquered my heart, Ronal.

01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:58.400
Now it becomes cheesy.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.600
It's time for ale and lager,
ale and lager.

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:07.600
Ale and lager, ale and lager.

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:14.900
You wanna see something sick?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.400
Wow!

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.800
Cool.

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:25.500
- Oh, that's good.
- I sense much tension in your muscles.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.100
I've been tied up on
a cross all week.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.800
Just shut up, man.
I want to say something important.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:40.000
To Ronal,
the thirstiest barbarian in the world.

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.100
Cheers!

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:50.400
- Why the hell aren't you drinking?
- Fucking barbarians, man.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.300
Ronal the Barbarian

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:18.100
oh, he was a weak boy
lacked a pair of balls

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.600
he wasn't pierced at all

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:30.600
oh, he was a geek boy
with a chest so small

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:48.800
big balls
hairy balls

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:51.800
hard balls
hot babes

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:54.900
hairy babes
yummy babes

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.200
yummy balls
and oily muscles too

01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:09.100
Ronal the Barbarian
he rules

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.500
big balls
hairy balls

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.500
hard balls
hot babes

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.400
hairy babes
yummy babes

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:41.700
yummy balls
and oily muscles too

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:07.100
we'll keep on fighting
muscles are shining

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:11.500
we are the champions

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.100
thunder and lightning
excess of lightning

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:25.600
fighting with balls
in thongs

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:33.300
we are together
all dressed in leather

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000
all bits are wet
and we're perfectly tan

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:45.300
we have pierced our nipples

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:45.900
