12:58.778 --> 12:59.822
'cause I could
go swimming every day

12:59.866 --> 13:01.215
in its secret ocean.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.521
- Wow.
- Wow is right.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.219
Very impressive,
my young space explorer.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.221
Galileo would be proud.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.529
- Of course.
If he can.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.576
- Um...yeah, sure.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.752
Yeah, if it's okay
with your mom.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.580
- We just have leftovers.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.234
- Sounds good to me.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.239
- Sorry, I got to take this.
- No worries.

13:25.282 --> 13:28.111
Come on, James.
It's puzzle day.

13:32.289 --> 13:35.597
- Just checking in on you,
Tess.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.425
- Believe it or not,

13:37.468 --> 13:39.470
life in a witness relocation
program of your own making

13:39.514 --> 13:42.430
isn't always as romantic
as I thought it would be.

13:42.473 --> 13:45.172
- We raided The Firm today,
Tess.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.217
- Did you find
what you were looking for?

13:47.261 --> 13:49.480
- Didn't really expect to,
but I will.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.221
And when I do,
hopefully that will end

13:51.265 --> 13:53.223
the danger to you and James.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.793
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.403
I don't have much credit left
on this phone.

13:59.447 --> 14:00.796
I'll trash it
and send you the number

14:00.840 --> 14:01.884
when I get a new one.

14:01.928 --> 14:02.885
- I know it's a hassle.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.365
- This is my life now.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.454
And you know what?
I'm okay with it.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.891
It took me eight years
to find James,

14:08.935 --> 14:12.460
to even convince people
I had a son.

14:12.503 --> 14:15.289
I'll never let anyone
take him away from me again.

14:15.332 --> 14:16.507
- Which is why I want
to make sure

14:16.551 --> 14:18.335
the bastards go down for good.

14:18.379 --> 14:19.902
I made you that promise
six months ago,

14:19.946 --> 14:21.599
and I intend to keep it.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.688
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to sound ungrateful.

14:23.732 --> 14:26.256
I appreciate what you
and Taka have done.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.519
It's just--
- No. Look, I understand.

14:28.563 --> 14:29.956

anything, okay?

14:29.999 --> 14:31.479
Money, whatever.

including her son.

about takeout tonight?

15:45.509 --> 15:48.251

15:48.295 --> 15:50.732
- That's weird.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.256

for their shiitake ravioli

15:53.300 --> 15:55.780
in truffle sauce all day.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.007

16:05.051 --> 16:08.619
- Youngest of eight, you learn
to clean up after everyone.

16:08.663 --> 16:11.405
- Hmm, I know a little
about that.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.320
Had an older sister
who kind of treated me

16:13.363 --> 16:15.365
like her own
personal slave.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.715
- Mm, so you know
what I'm saying.

16:24.113 --> 16:27.595
So where'd you grow up?

16:27.638 --> 16:30.032
- New York.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.860
You?

16:31.903 --> 16:33.993
- Maine, born and bred.

16:34.036 --> 16:38.301

used to not having any noise.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.608

16:44.394 --> 16:46.657
Most people find it peaceful.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.402
So how'd you end up here, then?

16:52.446 --> 16:55.362
- Got divorced and...

16:55.405 --> 16:59.714
needed to get as far away
as fast as possible.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.977

See, if that hadn't happened,

17:08.679 --> 17:09.811
then you never would have

I don't know what more

18:35.157 --> 18:36.593
I loved my wife.

I don't know why I did
what I did.

some reason, no?

18:44.253 --> 18:45.950

next-door neighbor,

18:49.128 --> 18:51.565
Mrs. Beatrice Mantoni.

18:51.608 --> 18:54.176
- Yeah, sure. We've been
neighbors for years.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.917
- She said she's been hearing
you two fighting

18:55.960 --> 18:58.180
pretty violently
for the last month or so.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.747
True?
- Okay, look.

18:59.790 --> 19:02.924
Annette and I have had
a rough time lately.

19:02.967 --> 19:06.188
That's what happens after
25 years of marriage, you know?

19:06.232 --> 19:07.972
It doesn't mean
I didn't love her.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.675
- What about the weird dream

19:14.718 --> 19:16.155
you were talking about
that night?

19:16.198 --> 19:17.939
Can you recall
any more details?

19:17.982 --> 19:20.202
- I'd been having a lot
of bad dreams.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.943
I still am.

19:21.986 --> 19:24.206
They're getting worse
and worse.

19:25.816 --> 19:28.254

she's in them.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.778
All of them.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.259
- I don't know.
It's weird stuff, you know.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.912
I'll sit down to dinner,
and she'll put

19:34.956 --> 19:38.481
a plate in front of me,
and it's our cat--dead,

19:38.525 --> 19:41.267
covered in bugs,
like cockroaches and stuff.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.225
And then another time,
I come upstairs,

19:43.269 --> 19:44.748
and she's having sex
with the mailman.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.838
- Okay, I think
we're done here.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.712
What the hell
was that all about?

19:51.755 --> 19:53.061
- Trying to find a motive,
same as you,

19:53.104 --> 19:54.976
something that can explain
a man killing his wife

19:55.019 --> 19:56.717
after 25 years of marriage.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.676
- And somehow, asking him
about his dreams does that?

19:59.720 --> 20:01.896
We're homicide detectives,
not shrinks.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.246

people walking in their sleep,

20:54.122 --> 20:57.125
Kids are amazingly resilient.
I mean, look at us.

20:57.168 --> 20:59.170
We didn't exactly have
the most normal childhood,

Okay, maybe not best example.

Burton.

22:37.094 --> 22:39.009
It'll take a few more weeks
to sift through everything,

22:39.053 --> 22:41.055
but so far, it looks as though
we have enough evidence

22:41.098 --> 22:43.362
to shut The Firm down
for at least a little while.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.974
Not permanently?
- Well, sure.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.933
There is a paper trail
indicating improprieties.

22:49.977 --> 22:52.414
Insider trading,
possible tax evasion,

22:52.458 --> 22:55.156
some SEC violations, but...

- Hey, look on the bright side.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.259

we punch them again

23:18.832 --> 23:20.877

eventually fold.

24:20.284 --> 24:22.417
What are you doing?
- I was just passing by.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.158
Recognized your car,
thought I'd say hi.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.160
- Hi.

24:26.203 --> 24:28.249
- Quite a coincidence.

24:28.292 --> 24:31.078
You're from New Jersey.
I'm from Teaneck myself.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.427
- Fascinating.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.299
- So guess I'll see you, then.

24:35.343 --> 24:37.476
- Sure.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.537
- He creeps me out is all.

24:57.017 --> 24:59.106
- Mm.
- Seems harmless enough.

24:59.149 --> 25:00.847
Sure, he might be trying
a little too hard

25:00.890 --> 25:03.806
with his L.L. Bean
outfits and all.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.460
We get a lot of city folks
coming in here

25:05.504 --> 25:07.157
trying to look, like, all rural.

25:07.201 --> 25:09.899
- Like me, you mean.
No.

25:09.943 --> 25:11.335
No, you're different.

25:11.379 --> 25:13.468
You fit in like you've
lived here all your life.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.296
- Hmm.

25:15.339 --> 25:16.819
- Still, he makes me nervous.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.168
- Relax, Vi.

Life is for having fun,
you know?

25:20.214 --> 25:21.824

25:21.868 --> 25:24.435
way too long

25:30.485 --> 25:31.921
- Damn FBI
suddenly isn't sure

25:31.965 --> 25:33.053
they can make
the case stick.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.445
- Damn.

25:34.489 --> 25:35.882
- If I can get the FBI

25:35.925 --> 25:38.145
real evidence
of criminal activity,

25:38.188 --> 25:40.626
I think it might be
a game changer.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.149
And I've got an idea
of where I might be able

25:42.192 --> 25:44.238
to find some
of Hull's special files.

25:44.281 --> 25:46.022
- Don't tell me everything.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.024

25:48.068 --> 25:50.287

It's been bugging
the hell out of me.

the details, but basically,

25:58.382 --> 26:01.081
this guy kills his wife
in cold blood.

26:01.124 --> 26:02.648
Doesn't know why.

26:02.691 --> 26:05.868
Last thing he knew,
he was dreaming.

26:05.912 --> 26:08.349
Like our kind of dreams?

26:08.392 --> 26:10.090

to happen ever again--never.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.335

we've been given a gift?

26:38.379 --> 26:42.296
No, I think
it's a curse, to be honest.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.558
