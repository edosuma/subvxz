Why didn't you stop them?

01:46.020 --> 01:47.400
I couldn't!

The library was sinking,
you guys were still inside, and...

You could've come to get us.

I could've saved him!

I can hardly feel any vibrations out here.

The sandbenders snuck up on me,
and there wasn't time for...

01:58.200 --> 01:59.290
You just didn't care!

01:59.370 --> 02:00.500
You never liked Appa!

02:00.580 --> 02:01.710
You wanted him gone.

You don't care whether
Appa is okay or not.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.350
We're all concerned,
but we can't afford to be fighting, now.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.060
I'm going after Appa.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.350
Aang, wait!

02:26.940 --> 02:28.730
We'd better start walking.

02:28.820 --> 02:31.400
We're the only people who know
about the solar eclipse.

02:31.490 --> 02:33.950
We have to get that information
to Ba Sing Se.

02:35.870 --> 02:39.620

03:12.940 --> 03:17.700
Colonel Mongke, what a pleasant surprise.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.540
If you're surprised we're here,

03:20.620 --> 03:23.620

03:31.920 --> 03:36.380
Sure, Colonel Mongke
and the Rough Rhinos are legendary.

03:36.720 --> 03:40.850
Each one is a different kind
of weapon specialist.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.310
They are also
a very capable singing group.

03:44.730 --> 03:47.060
We're not here to give a concert!

03:47.150 --> 03:49.190
We're here to apprehend fugitives.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.520
Would you like some tea first?

03:51.610 --> 03:52.730
I'd love some.

03:52.820 --> 03:54.110
How 'bout you, Kahchi?

03:54.190 --> 03:57.450
I make you as a jasmine man.

that don't want to attack you.

- No.
- Right, sorry.

stickin' together will be a problem.

05:15.820 --> 05:18.030
Katara, can I have some water?

05:18.400 --> 05:21.360
Okay, but we've gotta try to conserve it.

We're drinking your bending water?

be eating strange plants.

05:48.430 --> 05:50.180
( GULPING ) Ahh...

05:50.810 --> 05:52.600
There's water trapped inside these.

05:52.690 --> 05:54.900
- I don't know.
- Suit yourself.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.770
It's very thirst-quenching, though.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.490
( VOICE ECHOING ) Drink cactus juice.

06:04.570 --> 06:05.830
It'll quench you.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.740
Nothing's quenchier.

06:07.830 --> 06:09.750
It's the quenchiest!

06:10.200 --> 06:12.290
Okay, I think you've had enough.

06:13.210 --> 06:15.000
Who lit Toph on fire?

Can I get some of that cactus?

06:20.340 --> 06:21.970
I don't think that's a good idea.

06:22.050 --> 06:23.930
Come on, we need to find Aang.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.730

07:16.730 --> 07:18.690
Maybe it's friendly!

Let's just keep moving.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.650
I hope Aang's okay...

07:21.900 --> 07:23.610
( VOICE ECHOING ) Friendly mushroom!

07:23.690 --> 07:26.780
Mushy, giant friend!

07:29.740 --> 07:32.160
Yeah, a little, barefoot blind girl

07:32.240 --> 07:34.830
and her friends passed through here
a few days ago.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.960
Did they give you any indication
where they were headed?

07:38.960 --> 07:41.590
Maybe you could give me
a little incentive?

07:42.090 --> 07:45.260
You suggesting I break your fingers?

07:45.510 --> 07:47.050
They went in the desert.

07:47.130 --> 07:49.850
Too bad there's almost no chance
they survived.

07:50.180 --> 07:53.770
Mmm, that's okay,
'cause she's wanted dead or alive.

07:53.980 --> 07:55.390
No, she's not.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.940
I'm certain her father wants her alive.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.610
Hey, look.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.400
Fire Nation wanted posters.

So, look who's here.

KATARA: I'm sorry, Aang.

08:27.300 --> 08:31.140
I know it's hard for you right now, but
we need to focus on getting out of here.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.300
What's the difference?

08:32.850 --> 08:34.350
We won't survive without Appa.

We all know it.

08:35.850 --> 08:36.980
Come on, Aang.

08:37.060 --> 08:39.520
We can do this
if we work together, right, Toph?

08:39.850 --> 08:43.860
As far as I can feel, we're trapped
in a giant bowl of sand pudding.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.400
I got nothin'.

08:45.740 --> 08:48.360
Sokka, any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se?

you got from the library.

It was you!

10:20.040 --> 10:22.250
None of those will tell us where Appa is.

10:22.370 --> 10:25.710
No, but we can find out
which way Ba Sing Se is.

10:26.170 --> 10:28.210
We can use the stars to guide us.

Ah, this is interesting.

we're collecting a bounty,

14:28.910 --> 14:30.410
We need to head this direction.

14:33.580 --> 14:35.130
Ow!

14:35.460 --> 14:39.210
Crud, I am so sick of
not feeling where I'm going.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.970
And what idiot buried a boat
in the middle of the desert?

14:43.050 --> 14:44.090
A boat?

14:44.180 --> 14:47.350
Believe me, I kicked it hard enough
to feel plenty of vibrations.

14:47.430 --> 14:48.510
( MOANS )

14:58.440 --> 15:01.110
KATARA: It's one of the gliders
the sandbenders use.

15:01.530 --> 15:03.950
And look, it's got
some kind of compass on it.

15:04.410 --> 15:06.450
I bet it can point us out of here.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.660
Aang, you can bend a breeze
so we can sail it.

15:10.740 --> 15:11.830
We're gonna make it!

( LAUGHING )

15:24.430 --> 15:26.090
It is an honor to welcome

15:26.180 --> 15:29.180
such a high-ranking member
of the Order of the White Lotus.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.720
Being a grand master,
you must know so many secrets.

15:33.770 --> 15:37.150
Now that you've played Pai Sho,
are you gonna do some flower arranging?

15:37.230 --> 15:39.860
Or is someone in this club
gonna offer some real help?

15:40.190 --> 15:42.280
You must forgive my nephew.

15:42.570 --> 15:48.240
He is not an initiate, and has
little appreciation for the cryptic arts.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.870
Who knocks at the guarded gate?

15:53.080 --> 15:56.750
One who has eaten the fruit
and tasted its mysteries.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.590
I'm afraid it's members only.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.300
Wait out here.

16:11.260 --> 16:12.930
( SNIFFS )

16:21.770 --> 16:25.110
KATARA: The needle on this compass
doesn't seem to be pointing north,

16:25.190 --> 16:26.610
according to my charts.

16:26.990 --> 16:28.910
( DREAMILY ) Take it easy, little lady.

16:28.990 --> 16:33.200
I'm sure the sand folks who built this
baby know how to get around here.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.370
KATARA: That's what the compass
is pointing to.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.670
That giant rock.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.960
It must be the magnetic center
of the desert.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.290
A rock?

16:42.420 --> 16:43.840
Yes, let's go!

16:43.960 --> 16:45.960
Maybe we can find some water there.

16:46.090 --> 16:48.260
Maybe we can find some sandbenders.

16:58.690 --> 17:01.230
Ah, finally.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.530
Solid ground.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.950
SOKKA: ( BREATHING DEEPLY )

17:11.030 --> 17:13.910
I think my head is starting
to clear out the cactus juice.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.660
And look!

17:17.790 --> 17:20.330
( BOTH SPUTTERING )

Tastes like rotten penguin meat.

17:23.170 --> 17:25.420
Oh, I feel woozy.

17:25.710 --> 17:28.050
You've been hallucinating
on cactus juice all day,

17:28.170 --> 17:32.090
and then you just lick something
you find stuck to the wall of a cave?

17:32.180 --> 17:33.890
I have a natural curiosity.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.470
I don't think this is a normal cave.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.980
This was carved by something.

17:39.270 --> 17:42.230
AANG: Yeah, look at the shape.

17:42.810 --> 17:45.020
TOPH: There's something buzzing in here.

What are you doing?

18:15.640 --> 18:17.140
That rock almost crushed me.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.770
Sorry, I can't tell
where they are in the air.

18:19.850 --> 18:20.980
I got this one.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.400
Huh?

18:26.940 --> 18:29.110
I guess my head's not as clear
as I thought.

18:29.190 --> 18:30.860

We're heading to Ba Sing Se.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.290
Ba Sing Se?

20:10.420 --> 20:12.590
Why would we go to
the Earth Kingdom capital?

20:12.670 --> 20:14.590
The city is filled with refugees.

20:14.670 --> 20:16.340
No one will notice two more.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.930
We can hide in plain sight there.

20:19.180 --> 20:22.850
And it's the safest place
in the world from the Fire Nation.

From the looks of it,
you stole it from the Hami tribe.

We found the sailer
abandoned in the desert.

20:47.540 --> 20:49.420
We're traveling with the Avatar.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.460
Our bison was stolen,
and we have to get to Ba Sing Se.

You dare accuse our people of theft,

No one accused our people of anything.

we must give them hospitality.
