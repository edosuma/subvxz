There's no rifle that special.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.189
I want all available men now.

But, sir, can't you
delay the procession?

39:55.994 --> 39:58.496
You obviously do
not know your queen.

of War will be with her.

He's the intended target.

Yes, it's Lord Treadstone
they're after, not the Queen.

Britain owes you a
great debt, Detective.

And you too, Miss Fulford.

43:22.967 --> 43:25.670
I must admit, Chief,
I am perplexed.

43:25.670 --> 43:28.372
If Keating sought to
destabilise the British Empire,

43:28.372 --> 43:30.475
why not simply choose
the Queen as his target?

43:30.475 --> 43:34.145
Ah, because he was after
more than simple disruption.

43:34.145 --> 43:36.380
Keating and his people
wanted to control

43:36.380 --> 43:39.450

expansive military.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.286

stood in their way.

the consequences--

Lord Treadstone been killed.
