WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:03.271
Previously on
"Kevin Can Wait"...

00:03.337 --> 00:04.405
Sergeant Mendez called me in.

00:04.472 --> 00:05.739
He wants me
to go back undercover.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.741
Remember those guys selling
that counterfeit art?

00:07.808 --> 00:09.543
Well, one of them's been
askin' about me,

00:09.610 --> 00:11.245
so they need me to make
an appearance.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.713
I'm up for that promotion
at work.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.049
So it's -- it's more money,
it's my own parking space.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.584
Here's the offer --

00:16.650 --> 00:18.952
six figs, stock options,
piece of everything
we develop,

00:19.019 --> 00:21.622
plus...a signing bonus.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.592
$10,000?!

00:24.658 --> 00:26.060
All we gotta do is find
the location

00:26.127 --> 00:27.928
of where the deal's going down
and we're good.

00:27.995 --> 00:30.464
-Let Cellucci take the lead.
-Cellucci?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.700
You didn't tell me
Cellucci's on this case.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.402
We gotta see Domingo again.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.270
No, we can't. We're going to
Mets Fantasy Camp.

00:36.337 --> 00:39.207
This weekend is our biggest
art show in Boston.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.409
So it's settled.
You're coming tomorrow.
Boston.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.847
She kicked the table.
I saw her kick --

00:46.914 --> 00:48.516
Why would you do that?

00:50.518 --> 00:52.953
( Doorbell rings )

00:56.457 --> 00:58.392
-Hi!
-Vanessa, hi.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.027
-Hi, honey.
-( Kisses )

01:00.094 --> 01:02.296
I'm here to take your husband
away to a hotel
for the weekend.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.931
Oh. Good.
Get him outta here.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.433
( Both laugh )
Come on in.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.801
Oy. Let me guess.
He is not ready.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.537
-No, of course not.
-Right. You know what?

01:09.603 --> 01:12.273
Just pretending to be his wife
gives me agita.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.275
How you do it for real?
I do not know.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.410
Well, you know,
it's not easy,

01:16.477 --> 01:18.146
but he does have some
redeeming qualities.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.313
Mm.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.315
Uh, anyway,
I wanted to tell you,

01:21.382 --> 01:23.317
I packed Breathe-Rite strips
for him, so make sure

01:23.384 --> 01:24.918
he puts one on before
going to bed, okay?

01:24.985 --> 01:27.121
-Ugh. He snores?
-No, he's got sleep apnea.

01:27.188 --> 01:30.324
So it's more like he dies
and comes back to life

01:30.391 --> 01:31.659
every 30 seconds.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.060
-It's fun.
-That's nice.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.095
Also, if you want him to
stay asleep,

01:35.163 --> 01:37.565
put on something soothing,
but not rainforest noises

01:37.631 --> 01:40.000
because, uh,
the monkey sounds,
they really freak him out.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.903
-Oh.
-Hi. You ready to do this?

01:42.970 --> 01:44.938
Okay.
We're going to a nice hotel,

01:45.005 --> 01:46.307
and that's what
you're wearing?

01:47.641 --> 01:48.842
What? I'm going undercover.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.344
This is what
my character's wearing.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.979
Well, you look like a guy

01:52.045 --> 01:55.916
who's about to get whacked
on "The Sopranos."

01:55.983 --> 01:57.951
Yeah. Wait.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.187
He looks like Missy Elliot.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.921
Yes! Yes!
( Both laughing )

02:00.988 --> 02:02.690
Yes!

02:02.756 --> 02:04.458
( Mock laughing )

02:04.525 --> 02:06.660
-Go change.
-That's a good one.

02:06.727 --> 02:11.699
* I am not your ordinary guy

02:11.765 --> 02:13.367
( Horn honking in distance )

02:14.735 --> 02:17.070
Oh, boy.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.506
We got a problem.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.175
All right,
before you start complaining,

02:21.242 --> 02:23.010
I will be the bigger person.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.945
I will take the pull-out.
You can have the bed.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.181
Cool.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.616
Not even gonna fight me?

02:28.682 --> 02:31.352
I thought I was gonna have to,
but you made it pretty easy.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.786
Idiot.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.788
What are you gonna do?
Write me up like you used to?

02:34.855 --> 02:37.057
Okay. There it is.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.327
I was waiting
for the shoe to drop.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.729
It was 10 years ago.
You wanna get into it?

02:41.795 --> 02:43.297
No. 'Cause I don't live
in the past.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.598
I live in the present.
Mm.

02:44.665 --> 02:48.135
And I'm presently about to get
into this minibar!

02:49.470 --> 02:52.673
Okay, hey. You know that
candy bar costs $9, right?

02:52.740 --> 02:54.575
You heard Domingo
in the lobby. He was like...

02:54.642 --> 02:56.777
( Spanish accent )
"Enjoy yourselves."

02:56.844 --> 02:58.212
That's what I plan on doing.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.513
-Put it back.
-What?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.349
Put it...back.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.650
-Do not open it. Don't --
-What --

03:02.716 --> 03:05.219
Do not. Don't. Do --
( Muttering )

03:05.286 --> 03:06.587
Don't do it. Don't do it.
Hmm. Whoa.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.822
-Don't open it. Don't --
-Oh...

03:17.798 --> 03:19.300
( Chuckles ) Thank you.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.302
Okay, there he is.
It's promotion time.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.903
It's promotion time.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.638
-Donna!
-Larry.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.939
I wanted to talk to you

03:26.006 --> 03:27.308
about the opening for
the head nurse position.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.109
I would love to. Let's do it.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.612
And by the way,
you look great today.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.415
That's a little doughnut
there, but lookin' --
lookin' sharp.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.616
( Chuckles )

03:35.683 --> 03:37.451
Thing is,
we went with Joanne.

03:37.518 --> 03:41.522
Ah. ( Clicks ) Oh. Thank you.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.090
I said we went with Joanne.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.958
Jo...

03:45.025 --> 03:46.294
Joanne?

03:46.360 --> 03:47.795
Mm-hmm.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.597
( Mouth full )
She's got a great energy.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.765
And she'd be a perfect fit
for the high school.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.967
Perfect!

03:54.034 --> 03:56.136
Great.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.905
( Huffs )

03:57.971 --> 03:59.807
( Gasps ) I'm not gonna cry,
I'm not gonna cry,

03:59.873 --> 04:01.542
I'm not gonna cry.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.876
Should we key his car?

04:02.943 --> 04:04.077
No.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.046
Yumi, n--

04:06.113 --> 04:07.915
Maybe.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.083
Stand by.

04:13.287 --> 04:16.657
Hey. How are things going in
the world of accounting, Dave?

04:16.724 --> 04:17.958
Couldn't be better.
( Telephone rings
in distance )

04:18.025 --> 04:20.628
Uh, I believe the ping-pong
table just opened up.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.895
Wanna give it a go?

04:21.962 --> 04:25.433
No, I have some things
to do at home.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.501
( Whispers ) Get out.

04:28.569 --> 04:29.637
What?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.872
( Normal voice )
Oh. It's great.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.775
So much growth, it's stupid.
( Chuckles )

04:34.842 --> 04:37.511
( Whispering ) Sinking ship.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.080
We burned through
all the cash.
Investors bailed.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.616
( Normal voice ) Anyway,
I'm gonna grab me a scone

04:42.683 --> 04:44.918
and hit the road.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.854
( Whispers ) Seriously.
Run.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.598
Oh...

05:05.339 --> 05:08.141
( Waves crashing )

05:11.879 --> 05:14.682
Sleep tight,
you big, dumb dope.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.490
Domingo, I have to tell you,

05:22.556 --> 05:24.558
our buyers would love this.

05:24.625 --> 05:29.296
Our clients really respond
to sharp metal...th-- things.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.200
It's all the rage in Europe.
I'll -- I'll bet.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.903
So is that
where you ship from? Europe?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.905
Where's your husband?

05:37.971 --> 05:41.308
Oh, he's -- he's sleeping off
a rough night.

05:41.375 --> 05:44.011
He got into it a little
too deep with the minibar.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.380
-( Laughs )
-He has a problem
with alcohol?

05:46.447 --> 05:50.951
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Mostly snacks.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.953
( Waves crashing )
( Knock on door )

05:53.020 --> 05:54.354
Woman: Housekeeping!

05:54.422 --> 05:57.357
( Waves crashing )
Housekeeping?

05:57.425 --> 05:59.627
At the beach?

06:01.261 --> 06:04.164
( Knocks )
Housekeeping!

06:04.231 --> 06:06.834
( Waves continue )
What?

06:10.170 --> 06:12.372
"Soothing Sounds
of the Ocean."

06:12.440 --> 06:15.375
( Turns wave sound off )
Nice try, Cellucci.

06:15.443 --> 06:18.211
But you gotta be a little
smarter than that to fool --

06:18.278 --> 06:19.780
Crap! It's noon!

06:21.281 --> 06:23.584
So everything is
manufactured in Prague?

06:23.651 --> 06:25.018
Yes.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.355
Then we drop ship to various
locations here in the States.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.357
In fact, we have a warehouse
right in the back.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.426
What? Really?

06:32.493 --> 06:33.761
Yeah.
Wow.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.096
-Can I borrow you
for a second?
-No worries.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.265
I'll be right back.
Yes.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.068
( Electronic dance music
playing )

06:41.134 --> 06:44.071
See, I think it reflects
man's inhumanity towards man

06:44.137 --> 06:45.573
in a cruel world.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.941
Plus, it looks like the
classroom got hit
by a twister.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.943
You know what
I'm talkin' about...

06:50.010 --> 06:51.512
toothache lady?

06:51.579 --> 06:54.448
Got a lampshade dress.
She got a lampshade dress.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.949
( Lowered voice )
Can I talk to you?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.284
Okay.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.219
What the hell are you doing?

06:59.286 --> 07:01.288
You thought your little ocean
sounds would keep me sleeping?

07:01.354 --> 07:02.490
Well, it didn't work.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.625
Well, it's 1:14,
so it kind of did work.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.760
Just go back upstairs.
I can handle this.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.195
No. No, no. You're trying to
get rid of me.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.930
It's not gonna happen.
I will blow this case for you.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.298
No, you won't.
I promise.
I'll blow the whole sit--

07:11.364 --> 07:12.432
Just stop.
Let me ask you a question.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.634
What?
Who let that bird out?

07:13.701 --> 07:15.135
I have no idea what the --
The bird, you know?

07:15.202 --> 07:16.470
( Makes clucking sounds )
Stop it!

07:16.537 --> 07:18.071
( Clucking continues )
Okay, okay --

07:18.138 --> 07:19.673
Stop right --
Hey, everybody.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.742
Big baby, you're back in it.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.243
Here's where we're at.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.278
Domingo told me there is
a warehouse in this building.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.314
So now all we have to do

07:27.380 --> 07:29.517
is get him to admit that
he's selling forgeries.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.318
-And at that point --
-There he is!

07:31.384 --> 07:33.987
-Domingo!
-Ah. I missed you, my friend.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.689
Yeah, somebody smells like
cherry tobacco.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.892
Ah.
( Laughs )

07:38.959 --> 07:42.262
Domingo and I, we were talking
about his operation.
Mm.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.832
The secret to my success?
Come here.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.969
( Lowered voice )
It's all junk.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.338
You're selling forgeries?
No, that would be illegal.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.041
For instance, this is called
the "Eye of Zeus."

07:54.107 --> 07:55.909
It's actually
my nephew Stevie.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.845
I took it on an iPhone.
( Laughs )

07:57.911 --> 08:01.181
You zoom out,
we're at Chuck E. Cheese.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.516
Now if you'll excuse me,

08:02.583 --> 08:04.384
I think some money
just walked into the room.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.520
-Enjoy it.
-Sure, sure.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.722
( Sighs )

08:08.789 --> 08:10.791
So if they're not forgeries...

08:10.858 --> 08:12.960
Yes.
...they're not
doing anything illegal.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.728
I know.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.296
( Sighs )

08:16.363 --> 08:18.799
I can't believe this.
I mean, I...

08:18.866 --> 08:22.169
This was gonna be a big thing
for my career and now...

08:22.235 --> 08:24.872
I'm just gonna --
gonna look like an idiot.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.039
That's a tough break.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.307
Hey, listen,
there's a 7 p.m. flight.

08:27.374 --> 08:28.776
I'm gonna make it
to Mets Fantasy Camp.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.377
So if you don't mind --
Yeah, no, of course.
Please, go.

08:30.443 --> 08:33.280
And on your way out, make sure
you grab another $9 candy bar.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.749
Like you haven't had
enough junk today.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.018
Wait a second.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.286
What?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.890
-That's it.
-What?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.825
That's how they're making
their money.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.493
They don't make it
on the hotel room.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.195
They make it on the minibar,
the junk.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.663
That's what
they're doing here!

08:49.730 --> 08:50.964
That's it. The warehouse
you're talking about.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.099
Follow me. Come on.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.101
Well, other way.
Which way?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.936
No. Other way.
Hang on --

08:56.003 --> 08:58.138
It's still wrong. Okay.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.910
Think about it.
They make this junk in Prague

09:02.976 --> 09:04.612
and then they ship it
to America?

09:04.678 --> 09:07.547
Why spend all that money?
I'll tell you why.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.349
'Cause it's not just art
they're shipping.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.918
So narcotics.

09:10.984 --> 09:14.454
Exactly.
Look at this right here.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.089
That's cocaine!

09:17.157 --> 09:19.793
( Coughs )

09:19.860 --> 09:21.094
( Strained voice )
It's plaster.

09:21.161 --> 09:25.633
( Coughing continues )

09:30.503 --> 09:32.940
It got in deep.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.608
You done?

09:34.675 --> 09:35.909
Yes, I'm done.
Okay.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.711
So much for
your minibar theory, huh?

09:37.778 --> 09:39.379
( Coughs ) I'm not done.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.214
I'm done.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.585
Wait a minute.
( Rustling )

09:45.653 --> 09:47.054
Wait a minute.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.056
( Exhales deeply )

09:50.490 --> 09:52.325
You know what? I can't believe
I'm saying this,

09:52.392 --> 09:53.593
but you were right!

09:53.661 --> 09:54.928
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

09:54.995 --> 09:56.730
What did I say?!
( Gasps )

09:56.797 --> 09:58.331
We cracked the case!

09:58.398 --> 10:00.300
This is unbelievable.
Should we, like, shake hands

10:00.367 --> 10:02.936
or bump fists or --
All right,
let's just high-five.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.504
( Cellphone rings )
Yes. Yeah.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.506
My phone.
( Ring )

10:06.573 --> 10:08.008
Oh, it's Donna. Hey, babe.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.843
Hey, did you get my messages?

10:09.910 --> 10:11.511
I've been trying to reach you
since yesterday.

10:11.578 --> 10:14.081
Yeah, listen. Sorry, it's just
been crazy around here.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.582
Honey, you're not gonna
believe this,

10:15.649 --> 10:17.484
but that little weasel
Anderson --

10:17.550 --> 10:19.687
he picked Joanne over me.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.122
He said
she had a great energy.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.857
Well, you know what?
I'd have a great energy, too,

10:23.924 --> 10:26.559
if I was whacked out
on Adderall all the time.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.763
That's right. I said it.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.198
Babe, I'm sorry.
That's horrible.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.633
But I-I-I gotta cut you off.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.335
I'm -- I'm standing here
in the middle

10:35.402 --> 10:36.904
of a warehouse full of drugs,
and, uh...

10:36.970 --> 10:39.406
What?
Wait, are you okay?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.909
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
I mean, I'm great, actually.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.744
I mean, my juices are flowing.

10:43.811 --> 10:47.715
It's like I'm seeing things
before they even happen.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.884
It's almost like --
it's almost like
I never left the force.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.886
Oh -- wait, honey, are you --

10:52.953 --> 10:54.955
are you thinking about
going back on the job?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.423
( Whispers ) It's happening!

10:57.590 --> 10:59.026
It is?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.660
You treat all your buyers
this way?

11:00.728 --> 11:02.295
You're not a buyer,
you're a cop.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.464
My apartment was bugged.
What?

11:04.531 --> 11:07.100
We looked. We even checked
that stupid giraffe!

11:07.167 --> 11:09.036
Which, by the way,
my husband broke.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.871
That was not me.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.672
( Mouths word )

11:12.740 --> 11:13.941
It wasn't in the giraffe.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.475
It was in the gold toad
next to it.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.977
Everyone always checks
the giraffe.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.847
( Cellphone chiming )
Sorry.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.649
Domingo: Hello?
( Mouths words )

11:22.716 --> 11:25.018
Maritza,
we'll get the drugs.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.486
( Mouths words )

11:28.155 --> 11:30.423
We'll load 'em up in the van
and we're out of here.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.591
Yeah.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.593
( Chain creaking )

11:33.660 --> 11:36.263
You have the right
to remain silent.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.731
( Thud )

11:37.798 --> 11:40.633
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.970
( Thud, creaking )

11:43.036 --> 11:45.405
Okay, that's the wrong angle.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.079
It's throbbing,
but I gotta say,
my back feels great.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.885
Why is it that every time
I'm around you,

11:57.951 --> 12:00.287
my life goes into the toilet?

12:01.454 --> 12:03.090
You wanna write me up again?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.292
Well, you know what?
You can't, 'cause I'm retired.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.394
So there.
Okay, all right,
could you just figure out

12:07.460 --> 12:10.063
how to get us out of this?
You know what?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.465
I'll just do a sit-up
and unhook myself.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.135
I saw it in a movie once.

12:15.202 --> 12:18.605
( Shouts gibberish )

12:18.671 --> 12:20.774
( Continues shouting
gibberish )

12:22.342 --> 12:24.344
( Shouts gibberish )

12:25.813 --> 12:28.148
( Shouts gibberish )

12:29.416 --> 12:32.485
( Shouts gibberish )

12:32.552 --> 12:34.988
( Continues shouting
gibberish )

12:36.056 --> 12:37.791
( Breathing heavily )

12:37.858 --> 12:39.526
( Shouts gibberish )

12:41.261 --> 12:43.931
( Shouts gibberish )

12:45.365 --> 12:46.499
( Gulps )

12:50.637 --> 12:52.873
( Shouts high-pitched
gibberish )

12:54.041 --> 12:56.109
Yeah. I really thought
that was gonna work.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.612
Hold on.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.121
-Hello.
-Hello.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.129
You know, Yumi,
I slept on it,

13:16.196 --> 13:18.331
and I thought I could
keep it classy, you know,

13:18.398 --> 13:19.699
and not say anything.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.935
But then I look at his fat,
little monkey face

13:22.002 --> 13:24.371
and I just --
I can't do it.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.873
I can't do it.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.174
Um, Vice Principal Anderson,

13:27.240 --> 13:29.309
can I talk to you
for a moment, please?

13:29.376 --> 13:33.446
So, for too long,
you have taken advantage
of my hard work

13:33.513 --> 13:36.016
and my dedication
to this school.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.885
And it's just --
it's gotta stop.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.920
Donna, maybe we should just
go into my office

13:39.987 --> 13:41.989
and talk about this because
this is --

13:42.055 --> 13:44.657
Oh, this is what?
( Loudly ) Is this
embarrassing?

13:44.724 --> 13:46.326
Oh! No.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.062
You know what? No. We're gonna
do it right here
and right now.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.498
Because I've been
at this school
for 15 years, okay?

13:51.564 --> 13:54.634
And Joanne over there,
who got my promotion,

13:54.701 --> 13:57.737
by the way,
has been here for six.
Donna!

13:57.804 --> 14:00.908
No, you take my name
out of your mouth, Larry.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.709
Because you're
the problem here.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.412
Who else agrees that
he should be fired?

14:05.478 --> 14:06.947
Huh?!

14:07.014 --> 14:08.848
Raise 'em high. Raise 'em --

14:08.916 --> 14:10.850
No one.

14:10.918 --> 14:14.521
Okay. That's fine.
I'll be alone on this.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.689
I'm fine.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.091
I'm fine.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.094
My husband's going back
on the police force.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.331
And my son-in-law has got
a great job.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.499
And I don't need this.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.268
-I quit.
-Donna, don't do anything --

14:28.335 --> 14:32.105
No, save it, Larry.
Nurse Gable out.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.008
Would you hurry up?

14:35.075 --> 14:36.843
I'm moving as fast as
I can, all right?

14:36.910 --> 14:39.879
I still don't have blood
in 60% of my body.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.916
( Grunts )
All right, you wanna know why
I wrote you up?

14:42.983 --> 14:44.584
Yeah, we're about to be killed
by a drug lord,

14:44.651 --> 14:46.219
but let's get closure
on something that happened

14:46.286 --> 14:48.855
back in 2007.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.524
It's because of what happened
on News 12.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.260
What are you talkin' about?

14:53.326 --> 14:56.329
You remember the fire
at the mattress factory?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.365
You and me were doing
crowd control,

14:58.431 --> 15:01.001
and the news wanted to
talk to us and you said...

15:01.068 --> 15:03.470
( Imitating Kevin )
"Well, if you
really wanna know

15:03.536 --> 15:06.006
about traffic around
a mattress, talk to this one."

15:08.208 --> 15:10.944
( Laughing )

15:11.011 --> 15:13.713
That was classic.
( Speaks indistinctly )

15:13.780 --> 15:16.116
Well, it was the last thing

15:16.183 --> 15:18.751
my father ever saw
before he died.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.420
Really?

15:20.487 --> 15:22.055
But I...

15:22.122 --> 15:25.625
I had no idea. I'm...
I'm sorry.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.428
Well, he's not dead.
He lives in Boca.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.963
But...

15:32.966 --> 15:35.135
The point is

15:35.202 --> 15:37.470
that people made fun of me
because of you.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.306
Look, we were
just treating you
like one of the guys

15:39.372 --> 15:40.440
'cause that's what you wanted.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.774
No, I know. And I was
fine with that.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.343
Just not on TV.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.613
For two years, they called me
Bed, Bath, & Cellucci.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.148
( Laughs ) That's -- that's --

15:48.215 --> 15:50.250
That's not cool.
That's not cool. I get you.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.753
( Scoffs ) Okay.

15:53.820 --> 15:54.954
What do we do now?

15:55.022 --> 15:57.224
Look,
I think we just keep talking

15:57.290 --> 16:00.327
and slowly rebuild
trust again, you know?

16:00.393 --> 16:04.531
I'm talking about
the situation, idiot!

16:04.597 --> 16:06.233
Okay, I'm gonna get back
on those crates, all right?

16:06.299 --> 16:07.567
When Domingo comes in,

16:07.634 --> 16:09.769
you lure him right into this
area right here.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.604
I am gonna swing down
and take him out.

16:11.671 --> 16:12.772
Now listen to me.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.674
It's imperative that
he's right here, okay?

16:14.741 --> 16:17.244
'Cause this is the apex
of the golf swing, okay?

16:17.310 --> 16:18.878
It's right here
is where I clock him.

16:18.945 --> 16:22.482
So that's your plan?
A do-over?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.351
Think about it.
He'll never see it coming.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.554
-Who would ever do that twice?
-Right, because it's stupid!

16:28.688 --> 16:30.057
You know what?

16:30.123 --> 16:33.293
You're not gonna fix yourself
by breaking someone else.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.128
Okay, here she comes.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.067
-All right.
-Ooh!

16:40.133 --> 16:41.734
Playtime's over.
I've had enough of you two.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.836
Actually,
I've had enough of you.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.038
FBI.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.839
FBI?
Oh...

16:46.906 --> 16:48.341
Maritza?
Yes.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.377
Oh, yeah. What's the matter?
Oh, you didn't know, guy?

16:50.443 --> 16:52.245
Come on, it's pretty obvious.
Back from the diner we knew.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.247
-Shut up!
-Yes, sir.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.917
Fred and Wilma are safe.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.453
Move it! Move it.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.921
I got it from here, guys.

17:01.988 --> 17:05.492
Did that skank just call us
Fred and Wilma?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.360
I think she did.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.264
Oh.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.733
Kendra, I-I thought
I heard you leave.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.202
Oh, no. That was my mom.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.837
But what are you doing here?
Aren't you going to work?

17:17.904 --> 17:19.406
Of course.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.375
I do work.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.943
I'm going now.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.445
Aren't you gonna change?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.714
Oh. ( Chuckles ) Yes.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.350
I change for work.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.019
Okay, well, go get dressed
and I'll drive you.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.421
Babe, look at us.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.922
You know, you've got
a great job,

17:35.988 --> 17:37.357
and I'm going to Columbia.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.958
It's all happening.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.128
I know, I know.
It really is.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.396
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.043
Okay.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.813
It's only eight hours until
she picks me up.

18:03.650 --> 18:07.320
Hey, I gotta say, really,
really nice job out there.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.122
You know, this was
a good bust for you.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.159
Just for the record,
I'm sorry about the whole

18:12.225 --> 18:14.327
mattress-on-the-news thing.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.795
Thanks.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.830
It was a good bust
for both of us.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.400
And since we're apologizing,

18:20.467 --> 18:22.635
I am sorry
for writing you up.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.704
I appreciate
you saying that...

18:24.771 --> 18:26.539
Officer Memory Foam.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.143
Yeah, and by the way,

18:30.210 --> 18:31.544
you had food on your shirt
the whole time.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.680
Yeah, that was --
that was to steal focus

18:33.746 --> 18:35.248
from the amount
of eye makeup you had on.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.116
You were like...
( Smacking lips ) "Hey!

18:37.184 --> 18:39.686
( Smacking lips )
"Whoa, oh! I thought --

18:39.752 --> 18:41.488
Whoa. Whoa."

18:41.554 --> 18:43.456
Okay.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.492
You know what you should do?
You should try to get a job

18:45.558 --> 18:47.460
sweating professionally,
because you do it really well.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.861
Yeah, I --

18:48.928 --> 18:51.698
I might do that.
I might just do that.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.203
-Hey!
-Hey!

18:56.269 --> 18:57.970
Hey!
( Cheering )

18:58.037 --> 18:59.372
-Aw!
-Dad, we saw you on the news!

18:59.439 --> 19:01.007
They're saying you're a hero!
Oh, come on.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.743
First of all, the term "hero"
is thrown around too often.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.812
But in this case,
they threw a tight spiral

19:05.878 --> 19:07.079
'cause it's so true!

19:07.146 --> 19:08.681
It's so true!
Ah! Mwah!

19:08.748 --> 19:10.049
I was crushing it out there!

19:10.116 --> 19:12.118
I mean, I was unstoppable.
Yeah.

19:12.185 --> 19:15.388
Ah. So, kids, you know,
it looks like

19:15.455 --> 19:16.989
your dad's going back
on the force.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.158
But that doesn't mean he's not
gonna have plenty of time

19:19.226 --> 19:21.794
for you guys to --
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:21.861 --> 19:22.929
What?

19:22.995 --> 19:24.264
Who said that?

19:24.331 --> 19:27.400
You did. You said,
"It's happening."

19:27.467 --> 19:28.935
Yeah.
When?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.737
When we talked on the phone.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.306
I said, "Danger is happening."
I was happening.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.174
Oh...
I -- Are you kidding me?

19:35.242 --> 19:37.444
I-I love being retired.
This is awesome, by the way.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.379
Oh.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.881
-Oh.
-What?

19:41.948 --> 19:44.517
I kind of...quit my job.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.686
What -- what do you mean?

19:46.753 --> 19:49.989
I told you. I got passed over
for the promotion, so --

19:50.056 --> 19:52.492
Are you saying that
neither one of us
have a job right now?

19:52.559 --> 19:54.461
Honey, honestly,
what are we gonna do?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.229
We are the Gables,
all right?

19:56.296 --> 19:58.197
We've survived
much worse than this.

19:58.265 --> 20:01.568
Let's not forget Chale
has an amazing job now.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.670
That's a good point.
You know what, Chale?

20:03.736 --> 20:07.006
Uh...First of all,
I don't think I say it enough,

20:07.073 --> 20:10.009
if ever, um...

20:10.076 --> 20:11.644
but I'm proud of you, man.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.946
You -- you're a good man.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.949
Uh... ( Chuckles nervously )

20:17.016 --> 20:18.618
Thank you, Mr. Gable.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.086
No, no, e--

20:20.152 --> 20:23.790
Enough of that.
It's -- it's Kevin.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.525
( Exhales )

20:25.592 --> 20:28.194
Funny story, Kevin...
( Clears throat )

20:28.261 --> 20:30.730

20:30.797 --> 20:34.100
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:34.166 --> 20:37.637
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:37.704 --> 20:39.839
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:39.906 --> 20:41.374
* Do, do, do, do

20:41.441 --> 20:44.977
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:45.044 --> 20:48.047
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

20:48.114 --> 20:50.683
* I just don't want no...
