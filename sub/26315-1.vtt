WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:05.744
Morning.
Good morning.

00:05.788 --> 00:08.225
Who's ready for some first day
of law school breakfast?

00:08.269 --> 00:09.966
You got up early to cook for me?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.446
If it pleases the court,

00:11.489 --> 00:13.491
I'd like to introduce
these pancakes into evidence.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.928
And I will happily
tamper with it.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.843
[laughs]

00:17.887 --> 00:19.802
I also packed you
some snacks.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.891
A healthy one
and one you'll actually eat.

00:21.934 --> 00:25.982
Aw, you would've made
someone a great mom.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.072
I'm gonna let that slide

00:29.116 --> 00:31.248
because I can't believe
this day is finally...

00:31.292 --> 00:32.815
I know! I'm so proud of me.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.470
Oh, yeah, boy, that's
what I was about to say.

00:35.513 --> 00:36.906
I wrote something.

00:36.949 --> 00:39.039
"Christy, 40 years ago..."

00:39.082 --> 00:42.259
It's just that normally
I am not a big fan of me,

00:42.303 --> 00:45.132
but today I woke up and I was
like, "I am a freakin' miracle."

00:45.175 --> 00:49.875
Hey, look it, "miracle" is the
exact word I use in my thing.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.964
"Christy,
40 years ago..."

00:52.008 --> 00:53.705
When I got sober,
I said,

00:53.749 --> 00:55.925
"I am gonna go to law school,"
and here I am,

00:55.968 --> 00:57.709
actually going to law school.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.147
When I was drinking, I'd say,
"Oh, I want to get a Slurpee,"

01:00.190 --> 01:01.800
and I couldn't make it happen.

01:01.844 --> 01:06.414
Well, my thing touches on your
bad days in a more elegant way,

01:06.457 --> 01:07.980
but your example's good, too.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.547
I mean, isn't it crazy?

01:09.591 --> 01:12.202
I used to run from the law
and now I'm running towards it.

01:12.246 --> 01:16.076
Wow, that's good,
I wish I'd thought of that.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.860
"Christy, 40 years ago..."

01:17.903 --> 01:20.341
The best part is,
no one in any of my classes

01:20.384 --> 01:21.951
will know what
I used to be like.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.649
They will just see
a super smart future lawyer

01:24.693 --> 01:26.912
because I've changed
and I'm also wearing a blazer.

01:26.956 --> 01:29.219
Yeah. You do look smart.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.047
Oh, I got to go.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.483
You got this, baby.

01:32.527 --> 01:35.182
For the first time in my life,
I really think I do.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.837
Damn it.

01:38.881 --> 01:41.449
Looks like I got a couple
minutes. Tell me your thing.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.581
Oh.

01:43.625 --> 01:47.063
"Christy, 40 years ago,
when I spread my legs

01:47.107 --> 01:50.806
and launched you
into the world..."

01:50.849 --> 01:52.851
♪

02:11.740 --> 02:13.916
So I met this really cute
dermatologist,

02:13.959 --> 02:16.397
when I was at the dermatologist,

02:16.440 --> 02:17.920
and you'll never guess
what happened.

02:17.963 --> 02:20.096
He asked you out.He asked me out.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.492
Now y'all get ready to be proud
of me 'cause I told him,

02:24.535 --> 02:27.886
"I'm four months' sober and I
can't date till I have a year."

02:27.930 --> 02:30.106
Then later he
texted me and said,

02:30.150 --> 02:34.458
"233 days to go."
The day after that, "232."

02:34.502 --> 02:36.112
And the day
after that,

02:36.156 --> 02:39.246
"231."
Wrap it up.

02:39.289 --> 02:42.031
Anyway, looks like I'm
gonna marry a dermatologist,

02:42.074 --> 02:44.120
which is as good
as marrying a vampire.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.078
You never get old. Thanks.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.300
Bonnie, alcoholic.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.606
GROUP:
Hi, Bonnie.

02:51.649 --> 02:54.261
Well, I started planning
my wedding this weekend.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.045
At first I thought
it was gonna be torture,

02:56.088 --> 02:57.612
and then it hit me--

02:57.655 --> 03:01.181
this is a day all about me,
planned by me, starring me.

03:01.224 --> 03:04.009
Isn't that
every day?

03:04.053 --> 03:06.142
Maybe I always hated weddings
because, deep down,

03:06.186 --> 03:08.100
I was afraid no one
would ever love me enough

03:08.144 --> 03:09.711
to want to marry me.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.148
Now I feel bad.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.802
But sobriety changed me
into someone

03:13.845 --> 03:15.238
who's totally marry-able.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.807
My only regret is waiting
till I was 49 to do it.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.984
[mouthing]

03:23.203 --> 03:24.943
WENDY: Would anyone
else like to go?

03:24.987 --> 03:28.077
I would.
Christy, alcoholic.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.861
GROUP:
Hi, Christy.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.777
So, today was my
first day of law school.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.866
Which is, uh,

03:34.910 --> 03:38.435
kind of the culmination
of a lifelong dream.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.524
And guess what.

03:40.568 --> 03:43.179
It was terrifying.

03:43.223 --> 03:47.270
Like "running out of booze
in Utah" terrifying.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.054
Before we begin
this morning,

03:49.098 --> 03:51.361
I would like you all
to look to your left,

03:51.405 --> 03:52.884
look to your right.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.452
By the end of the year,

03:55.496 --> 03:58.368
one of you will not be here.

04:01.110 --> 04:04.461
Wait-wait,
what's happening here?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.118
I knew law school
was gonna be intense.

04:09.161 --> 04:11.686
I just kind of thought
we would ease into it.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.296
You know, go around the room

04:13.340 --> 04:16.299
and talk about why
we want to be lawyers.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.520
No, it was, "Tell me
the relevance of this case,"

04:19.563 --> 04:23.088
and "Analyze the implications
of that decision."

04:23.132 --> 04:25.439
And it's totally unfair

04:25.482 --> 04:28.137
that the other kids don't
have to juggle homework,

04:28.180 --> 04:30.182
a full-time job, AA,

04:30.226 --> 04:32.184
Gamblers Anonymous,
and a mom who watches

04:32.228 --> 04:35.536
Property Brothersand
then has to talk about it.

04:35.579 --> 04:36.537
And, yeah,

04:36.580 --> 04:38.539
I called myself a kid.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.193
If she gets to be 49,
then I get to be a kid.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.939
Adam, we got to go.
Why are you drinking a beer?

04:47.983 --> 04:51.116
Because beer is awesome?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.118
You have no idea
where we're going.

04:53.162 --> 04:56.774
I do so. We're going
to the, um...

04:56.818 --> 05:00.038
The Lakeside Terrace...Lakeside Terrace!
Right. See, I know.

05:00.082 --> 05:03.215
Because...?Because of the reason
we agreed on.

05:03.259 --> 05:06.088
Come on, I told you
all this stuff.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.481
It's a possible wedding venue...

05:07.524 --> 05:09.309
Venue! Venue, yeah.Oh, my God.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.485
I know.
You never remember
anything I tell you,

05:11.528 --> 05:13.225
and yet you can recall
every friggin' detail

05:13.269 --> 05:15.402
about a basketball game
you saw four years ago.

05:15.445 --> 05:18.405
When the Warriors won
their first championship

05:18.448 --> 05:21.538
and they beat the Cavaliers
in six, it was epic.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.803
Two games went to OT.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.283
Yeah, I get it.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.502
You only remember
what's important to you.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.330
Classic case of Manzheimer's.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.289
Look, getting married
is important to me,

05:33.333 --> 05:36.423
but, you know, where we do it...

05:36.466 --> 05:40.078
what we're wearing,
the color of the pigeons isn't.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.080
Pigeons?

05:43.125 --> 05:45.127
All I know is that it's gonna be

05:45.170 --> 05:47.085
the best day of my life
no matter what.

05:48.652 --> 05:51.220
I hate it when you say
nice things when I'm mad at you.

05:51.263 --> 05:54.136
Look, let's save ourselves
a million arguments.

05:54.179 --> 05:57.052
You plan the wedding,
and I'll show up.

05:57.095 --> 05:58.445
Really?

05:58.488 --> 06:00.534
Absolutely.
Do whatever makes you happy.

06:00.577 --> 06:02.405
Mm-hmm. You swear
you won't complain

06:02.449 --> 06:04.407
about the things I choose?I swear.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.061
What if I want a mariachi band?

06:06.104 --> 06:07.410
I say olé.

06:07.454 --> 06:08.585
What about a chocolate fountain?

06:08.629 --> 06:10.370
I'll shove my whole head in it.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.850
I want our officiant
to be a mime.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.939
Bluffing.
You're afraid of mimes.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.332
[scoffs] I am not.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.379
Very funny. That's enough.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.902
Stop it. Seriously, stop it.

06:23.687 --> 06:26.908
Thank you. Happy anniversary.

06:27.996 --> 06:30.868
Cheap old bastards.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.569
Christy, where are you going?

06:35.612 --> 06:37.527
My last table just left.
I'm out of here.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.311
No, no, no, no. Cindy
just went home sick.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.183
I need you to cover her tables
for the rest of the night.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.794
What? No, no, no, I-I can't.
It's my first week...

06:43.838 --> 06:46.449
First week of law school,
I know. We all know.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.451
I haven't talked
about it that much.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.974
Max, what's new with Christy?

06:50.018 --> 06:52.629
Law school, look left,
look right, very scary.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.762
Well, it was scary.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.416
And so is the mountain
of reading

06:56.459 --> 06:58.113
I have to do tonight.
See you tomorrow.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.767
Christy! [clears throat]

06:59.810 --> 07:01.290
Christy...

07:01.333 --> 07:03.379
I do not have the
emotional capacity

07:03.423 --> 07:04.772
to deal with you right now.

07:04.815 --> 07:06.948
My marriage is crumbling
right in front of me.

07:06.991 --> 07:09.559
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.300
Because I don't blab to everyone
about the flight attendant

07:11.343 --> 07:13.694
my husband met on the way
back from Cincinnati.

07:13.737 --> 07:14.956
Okay, but I really...

07:14.999 --> 07:16.914
You are staying. Go
check on table six.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.525
I'll be in my office
doing crunches,

07:18.568 --> 07:21.441
preparing for my new life
as a single 40-year-old man.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.399
That's 85 in gay years!

07:25.445 --> 07:27.142
Hey.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.927
Youasked me.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.495
Hi.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.236
I'm Christy.
I will be your server

07:34.279 --> 07:35.367
for the rest of the evening.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.718
I know I look stressed
and unhappy,

07:37.761 --> 07:39.807
but don't let that diminish
your dining experience.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.681
[grunts] Damn it!

07:44.725 --> 07:46.466
Huh?

07:46.509 --> 07:48.685
How could you?

07:48.729 --> 07:51.166
Bonnie, wake up.
You're dreaming.

07:54.212 --> 07:57.128
You son of a bitch.What?

07:57.172 --> 07:58.565
You cheated on me.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.871
You were dreaming.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.482
Who with?

08:03.526 --> 08:05.354
As if you don't know.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.355
I-I really don't.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.313
Louise from Trader Joe's.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.533
And when I caught you,
you just shrugged

08:10.577 --> 08:12.100
and said,
"What's the big deal?"

08:12.143 --> 08:14.450
You can't blame me
for something I did

08:14.494 --> 08:16.800
in your dream.Watch me.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.672
Going at it like a couple
of middle-aged bunnies

08:18.715 --> 08:21.283
right there on top
of the prewashed lettuce.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.855
Hey.Hey.

08:27.898 --> 08:29.378
What are you doing up?

08:29.421 --> 08:32.163
Adam's cheating on me.What?

08:32.207 --> 08:34.514
It was in a dream, but that
doesn't make it any less real.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.735
Why are you home so late?[sighs]

08:38.779 --> 08:40.520
I had to cover
for another waitress.

08:40.563 --> 08:44.132
I got rid of all of her tables
by 10:00 except for one.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.743
They had their coffee,
I'm about to drop the check,

08:46.787 --> 08:49.877
and this douche
gets down on one knee

08:49.920 --> 08:52.096
and proposes
to his stupid girlfriend.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.577
I had to take pictures,

08:54.621 --> 08:56.840
and she had to cry and call
everyone she's ever met.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.581
It was disgusting.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.410
Well, she may be happy now,
but as soon as that ring

09:01.453 --> 09:03.412
goes on the finger,
that's when they start cheating.

09:04.456 --> 09:05.806
In your dream.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.938
Hey, we had to hear
about your dream for five years.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.027
How about we talk about mine
for five minutes?

09:10.071 --> 09:12.421
I don't have time for this.
I got to study.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.425
Oh, God.What?

09:16.468 --> 09:18.862
My backpack.
I don't have my backpack.

09:18.906 --> 09:19.950
Did you leave it in the car?

09:19.994 --> 09:21.604
No. It's at the restaurant.

09:21.648 --> 09:22.649
All my books are in there.

09:22.692 --> 09:23.780
So go back and get it.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.608
It's closed. I don't have a key.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.219
[sighs] Fine,
I'll get dressed.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.786
What are you gonna do?

09:29.830 --> 09:31.092
I'm gonna break
into the restaurant

09:31.135 --> 09:32.615
with a couple of bobby pins.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.878
"Keys." [scoffs]

09:34.922 --> 09:37.141
What happened to you?

09:41.145 --> 09:42.625
What are you doing?

09:42.669 --> 09:44.975
I'm trying to avoid
the security cameras.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.455
They disconnected those

09:46.498 --> 09:48.849
after the owner's wife saw him
having sex with a waitress

09:48.892 --> 09:51.286
up against that Dumpster.

09:51.329 --> 09:52.461
Was it you?

09:52.504 --> 09:55.812
We are not here
to talk about the past.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.902
Now, can you just move
it along, Hamburglar?

09:58.946 --> 10:04.038
Okay, Baldwin mortise lock
with a 2 3/4-inch cylinder.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.475
Huh. Might as well
just tape the door shut.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.782
Hurry, I've got class
at 8:00 a.m.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.697
Relax. I got this.

10:10.740 --> 10:15.702
There... it... is.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.747
Voilà.

10:21.925 --> 10:25.276
Well, Baldwin's really
stepped up their game.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.800
Are you kidding?
You said you could do this.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.541
Yeah, and you said we weren't
here to talk about the past.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.674
Fine, just help me
get up to that window.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.676
It's called a transom.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.330
If you watched
the Property Brotherswith me,

10:35.373 --> 10:36.897
you'd know that.[sighs]

10:36.940 --> 10:39.682
I don't care what it's called.
Just push me through it.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.292
Push you through what?

10:41.336 --> 10:43.338
The transom.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.039
[grunts]

10:49.083 --> 10:50.911
Are those new shoes?
They're really cute.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.870
Focus!

10:53.914 --> 10:55.872
[grunts]

10:55.916 --> 10:57.613
[alarm blaring]

10:57.657 --> 11:02.226
Mom! Help me get down!

11:02.270 --> 11:03.706
Did you run away?!

11:03.750 --> 11:05.577
Yeah, but I came back.

11:05.621 --> 11:06.970
That's progress.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.798
Yeah, points for you.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.670
Jump. I'll catch you.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.587
Ow.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.633
Nice going.
You completely missed my arms.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.336
Pierson v. Post.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.208
What are the facts?

11:41.613 --> 11:43.790
Ms. Plunkett?

11:45.835 --> 11:47.750
Oh.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.448
Pierson v. Post,you say?

11:50.492 --> 11:52.233
I did say.

11:52.276 --> 11:55.236
I-I'm gonna be honest.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.760
I didn't have time
to read the case,

11:57.804 --> 12:00.110
but I have
a very good explanation.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.722
My backpack is locked up...

12:02.765 --> 12:04.288
I don't need explanations.

12:04.332 --> 12:05.899
I just need you
to do the reading.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.423
I promise
I will read it tonight.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.516
Read it now.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.910
Now?

12:16.953 --> 12:18.781
We'll wait.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.783
Okay.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.832
I need that.

12:42.457 --> 12:47.375
Ah. Pierson and Post are people.
[chuckles]

12:47.418 --> 12:50.465
It's very good.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.902
20 minutes.

12:52.946 --> 12:55.383
They watched me read
for 20 minutes.

12:55.426 --> 12:58.038
You know how it's hard to pee
when people are watching you?

12:58.081 --> 12:59.300
It's even harder to read.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.693
Who watches you pee?

13:03.304 --> 13:05.132
Don't take it personal.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.656
These professors are just trying
to weed out the weak ones.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.440
I was talking to my lawyer.

13:09.484 --> 13:12.400
He used to be a Navy SEAL, and
he said law school was harder.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.010
Oh, God, what if I'm one
of the weak ones?

13:14.054 --> 13:16.012
Why were you talking
to your lawyer?

13:16.056 --> 13:17.318
Hang on. I'm trying
to help your daughter.

13:17.361 --> 13:18.623
No, no, no.
Just-just real quick.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.842
Is it for a prenup?

13:19.886 --> 13:22.105
Bonnie, come on. She's upset.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.151
Don't worry about
this. This...'Cause I know lawyers, too.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.543
Really? You want
to do this now?

13:25.587 --> 13:27.241
Well, you seem
to want to do it.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.633
Great, let's set a meeting.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.679
Let's do it.
My guy's a real pit bull.

13:30.722 --> 13:33.029
My guy was part of the team
that killed Bin Laden.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.031
Oh, yeah, well,
my guy's a recovering alcoholic,

13:35.075 --> 13:36.467
and they're mean.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.992
[laughing]:
I know. I'm marrying one.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.351
Now you'regonna watch me read?

13:53.354 --> 13:56.052
So I've narrowed it down
to two centerpieces.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.141
Do you like the calla lilies
or the sunflower?

13:58.185 --> 14:00.274
What the hell?!

14:00.317 --> 14:01.928
What?

14:01.971 --> 14:03.407
I'm trying to plan our wedding,

14:03.451 --> 14:05.235
and you're making out
with Louise again?

14:05.279 --> 14:06.671
Well, I'm trying
to make out with Louise,

14:06.715 --> 14:08.325
and you keep planning
our wedding.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.546
[moaning]

14:11.589 --> 14:13.374
Fine. I'll choose
the flowers myself.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.419
Me-- I like a
Gerber daisy.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.684
You're myGerber daisy. Mmm.Aw.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.559
I hate you.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.173
Every night this
week, the same dream.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.653
Except Wednesday, I dreamt

14:31.696 --> 14:33.960
I was the night manager
of a gas station.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.049
Could've been a premonition.
We'll see.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.964
Are you afraid Adam's
actually cheating on you?

14:38.007 --> 14:39.661
No, I trust him.

14:39.704 --> 14:42.316
Plus, I went to Trader Joe's and
did a little digging on Louise.

14:42.359 --> 14:45.449
Turns out she's into the ladies.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.452
So you went to Trader Joe's
and basically stalked someone

14:48.496 --> 14:50.846
because she appeared
in your dream.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.587
Attagirl.

14:54.545 --> 14:57.722
Let's be clear. I was already
there for the wasabi peas.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.594
It's not like
I made a special trip.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.813
Yeah, 'cause
thatwould cross the line.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.512
I never have dreams.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.513
You don't dream?

15:05.556 --> 15:07.210
Nope.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.386
Every night is just
an eight-hour preview of death.

15:15.392 --> 15:16.959
You know who else doesn't dream?

15:17.003 --> 15:18.482
Serial killers.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.397
Why would you say that?

15:20.441 --> 15:21.703
I'm not saying she is one.

15:21.746 --> 15:23.183
I'm just saying she's not alone.

15:24.532 --> 15:27.361
Can we just get the check
and go to the meeting?

15:27.404 --> 15:29.145
I thought you had class.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.146
I'm not going.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.105
You're skipping already?

15:32.148 --> 15:34.020
I'm not skipping.
I quit.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.327
No, you can't quit.

15:37.371 --> 15:40.809
I'm not cut out for law school.
It's just too hard.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.334
They're trying
to weed out the weak ones,

15:44.378 --> 15:46.771
and I'm saving them the trouble.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.645
Say something.Say something.

15:51.907 --> 15:54.257
Am I just listening,
or do you want feedback?

15:54.301 --> 15:56.564
Just listening.
I-I've made up my mind.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.566
The only thing I've learned

15:58.609 --> 16:01.743
from two weeks in law school
is that I'm clueless.

16:01.786 --> 16:04.833
Though not as clueless as you.

16:04.876 --> 16:07.227
How can you not see
you're having these dreams

16:07.270 --> 16:09.011
about Adam cheating on you
because deep down

16:09.055 --> 16:10.665
you want him
to help you with the wedding?

16:10.708 --> 16:11.883
No, I don't.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.624
Yes, you do.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.713
Believe it or not,
you have actually grown,

16:15.757 --> 16:17.672
and you want a real partnership.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.717
You don't want
to be the narcissistic,

16:19.761 --> 16:21.676
steamrolling monster
you've always been.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.592
I'm pretty sure I do.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.073
MARJORIE:
Christy,

16:27.116 --> 16:29.466
you didn't think you
could get your GED.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.642
You didn't think you
could get into college.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.949
You didn't think you
could get into law school,

16:33.993 --> 16:36.169
but you did all
those things.

16:36.212 --> 16:39.476
We always look at the mountains
ahead of us, and we forget

16:39.520 --> 16:42.740
the mountains behind us
were just as hard to climb.

16:42.784 --> 16:45.178
Whoa.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.095
We got to start
writing this stuff down.

16:52.794 --> 16:56.058
Hi. My name is Amanda,
and I guess I'm an alcoholic.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.495
GROUP:
Hi, Amanda.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.369
I've never been
to a meeting before,

17:02.412 --> 17:04.719
so I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to say.

17:07.722 --> 17:11.030
I don't know how I'm gonna get
through today without drinking.

17:11.073 --> 17:14.642
CHRISTY:
Hi. My name is Christy,

17:14.685 --> 17:18.080
and I think I'm an alcoholic.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.690
GROUP:
Hi, Christy.

17:19.734 --> 17:22.650
This is my first time
at a meeting,

17:22.693 --> 17:26.610
and, uh...

17:26.654 --> 17:30.310
I came here because, um...

17:30.353 --> 17:34.618
I've done a lot
of screwed up things in my life,

17:34.662 --> 17:37.795
but the one thing I said

17:37.839 --> 17:40.102
I would never do is, uh...

17:42.235 --> 17:45.238
...drive drunk
with my kids in the car.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.721
And then...

17:52.767 --> 17:55.726
Um...

18:00.862 --> 18:04.953
And I-I thought that that would
be enough to get me to stop,

18:04.996 --> 18:07.608
but...

18:07.651 --> 18:10.872
then I drank again the next day.

18:12.874 --> 18:15.137
Actually, that's not true.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.008
I drank that night.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.010
[sighs]

18:19.054 --> 18:21.187
Um, and every morning since,

18:21.230 --> 18:23.754
I-I wake up, and I say,

18:23.798 --> 18:25.843
"I am not gonna drink today,"

18:25.887 --> 18:28.803
but I'm always drunk by 5:00.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.981
Uh...

18:33.024 --> 18:35.592
No matter what I do,
I can't stop.

18:38.639 --> 18:41.642
I'm here to...
to try to get sober,

18:41.685 --> 18:44.558
but it seems impossible.

18:44.601 --> 18:47.082
AMANDA:
So,

18:47.126 --> 18:49.650
I'm here today,

18:49.693 --> 18:52.740
and I guess that's something.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.787
That's it.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.665
Hi. I'm Cynthia, and
I'm an alcoholic.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.623
GROUP: Hi, Cynthia.You were right.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.625
CYNTHIA: Last night I was out to
dinner with some friends...

19:08.669 --> 19:11.062
Law school isn't the hardest
thing I've ever done.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.935
CYNTHIA: For a split second, I
thought, "I want to try that."

19:13.978 --> 19:16.590
Amazing how fast I can forget
that I'm an alcoholic.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.244
So, instead, I sipped
my cranberry juice...

19:18.287 --> 19:19.984
Where are you going?

19:20.028 --> 19:24.163
I have class, and I've got to
find the kid I sold my books to.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.777
CYNTHIA:
...to remind me every day
that I can't have just one.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.692
I mean, maybe
I could have one,

19:31.735 --> 19:33.998
but in no time, I know
I would be back...

19:34.042 --> 19:35.652
Um, I'm Christy.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.524
Let me give you my number.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.440
...no longer be asked out
to dinner by friends. Crazy.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.492
[groaning]

19:52.278 --> 19:54.323
Aah!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.284
Oh, there's nothing
to be sorry about.

19:58.327 --> 19:59.720
Just go back to sleep.

19:59.763 --> 20:02.026
You sure?
Yeah.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.289
Wait.

20:03.332 --> 20:07.118
Aw. What?

20:07.162 --> 20:11.035
I want you to help
plan the wedding.
Really?

20:11.079 --> 20:13.212
Yeah, it shouldn't
just be about me.

20:13.255 --> 20:16.215
It should be about us,
about our life together, so...

20:16.258 --> 20:19.218
I need you
to be a part of it.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.133
Okay.
Thank you.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.918
I always thought
it'd be kind of cool

20:23.961 --> 20:25.224
to get married
on a boat.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.921
That's not happening.
Okay.

20:28.923 --> 20:31.273
And see?
Isn't this better?

20:31.317 --> 20:32.970
Mmm.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.494
Oh, one more thing?
[sighs]

20:34.537 --> 20:36.974
No more shopping
at Trader Joe's.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.889
Oh, fine, whatever.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.544
Not that it matters, but you
know, the real Louise is gay.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.981
[sighs]

20:44.025 --> 20:45.287
How do you know that?

20:45.331 --> 20:48.464
Uh... it was in
the newsletter.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.466
Good night, baby.
