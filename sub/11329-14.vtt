WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:03.903
I knew you'd run from me the second

00:03.971 --> 00:06.039
either one of us showed any
feelings toward the other one.

00:06.106 --> 00:09.142
Maybe I'm just not ready to be
in an exclusive relationship.

00:09.209 --> 00:11.911
I didn't say I was ready to
do that... just be with you.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.413
If Grace were to have me back

00:13.480 --> 00:15.415
and she wanted to give it one more shot,

00:15.482 --> 00:18.418
I think I'd have to go back with her.

00:18.485 --> 00:21.287
Who did you have a chance to
have sex with? Was it Ashley?

00:21.355 --> 00:24.924
- You know I'd never have sex with Ashley.
- No, of course not.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.760
I don't think Amy's ever gonna be able
to stop you from being with other girls.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.262
You two really shouldn't be together.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.598
And yet you're about to get
remarried to your husband.

00:32.665 --> 00:35.301
- When are you gonna see Ben?
- I don't know when I'm going to see Ben.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.769
I do plan on seeing him, but...

00:36.837 --> 00:39.105
but you were waiting to see
how things go with me first?

00:39.173 --> 00:40.606
Tell your mom thanks for inviting me over.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.608
I just can't figure out why she let you

00:42.676 --> 00:44.711
actually come over here
in the middle of the night.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.946
She trusts us. She trusts me anyway.

00:47.014 --> 00:48.948
I gotta talk to my dad
about giving you that ring.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.450
The ring. I forgot all about the ring.

00:50.517 --> 00:53.286
Please make it clear that
it's not an engagement ring.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.288
Would you and John like
to go out with me tonight?

00:55.356 --> 00:57.090
We would love to.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.028
She's not here?
How could she not be here?

01:02.096 --> 01:04.397
She has to be here!
You didn't see her when you got in?

01:04.465 --> 01:06.666
No, I didn't!
Why is everyone yelling?

01:06.734 --> 01:08.768
Could you stop yelling?
I'm not good with yelling.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.169
Welcome home, huh?

01:10.237 --> 01:12.472
Did Ashley see the two of you together?
Is that what happened?

01:12.539 --> 01:14.474
No, that is not what happened.
We weren't together.

01:14.541 --> 01:16.142
We weren't together together anyway.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.745
You were together when I saw you.
We slept in Amy's room.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.114
That's all we did in her room.
I didn't know if I should go home.

01:21.181 --> 01:23.483
Amy said I didn't have to
go home. We were talking.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.485
Why would he leave in the
middle of the night anyway?

01:25.552 --> 01:27.854
But I should probably go home now, Amy.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.522
I think I've been here long enough.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.858
Maybe if I go home, Ashley will come back.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.460
Come back from where?
How do we even know she's run away?

01:34.528 --> 01:35.895
Because she wasn't here
when your mother went in

01:35.963 --> 01:37.430
to say good-bye to her
before she left for work.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.699
That's how we know she's not here.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.933
Oh. What?

01:41.001 --> 01:42.435
Maybe she got upset

01:42.503 --> 01:44.670
because the two of you
are getting married again.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.005
Maybe that's why she left.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.508
Yeah. Maybe it has nothing
to do with Amy and me.

01:48.575 --> 01:51.477
And maybe it does.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.816
A friendship ring?

01:56.884 --> 01:59.685
Yeah, a friendship ring.
And if the friendship grows...

01:59.753 --> 02:01.687
And it better.
Or what?

02:01.755 --> 02:04.023
Adrian is not getting
married before the baby comes,

02:04.091 --> 02:06.325
and not any time soon
after the baby comes.

02:06.393 --> 02:07.994
I am if I want.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.531
And I'm not getting
married if I don't want.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.704
Ben, you're marrying her.
It's not an engagement ring.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.406
It's a... friendship ring.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.542
A four-carat sapphire
ring is a friendship ring?

02:22.609 --> 02:24.410
Do you know how much that thing is worth?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.179
How do you know how much it's worth?

02:26.246 --> 02:27.914
I had it appraised.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.981
When?

02:29.049 --> 02:30.516
When I found your book hidden in here.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.584
Why?

02:31.652 --> 02:32.985
Insurance.

02:33.053 --> 02:35.121
<i>You had it in a book titled fake book.</i>

02:35.189 --> 02:38.524
I noticed it. I figured
a thief would notice it.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.527
Well, whatever it's worth,

02:41.595 --> 02:43.529
I don't care if Ben
gives the ring to Adrian

02:43.597 --> 02:46.165
as a friendship ring or...
or any other kind of ring.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.502
$50,000.

02:50.637 --> 02:52.405
What?

02:52.473 --> 02:55.374
Oh, my gosh!

02:55.442 --> 02:57.677
Oh, wow!

02:57.744 --> 03:00.847
<i>I feel like I'm on antiques roadshow.</i>

03:00.914 --> 03:02.548
Oh, ain't that something, Ben?

03:02.616 --> 03:05.218
Betty, I... I told you, I don't
know if I can get it back.

03:05.285 --> 03:06.986
I gave it to Adrian already.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.856
And I told you if you gave her an
engagement ring, you're marrying her.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.557
It's not an engagement ring.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.059
Oh, so maybe you can get it back then.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.497
He's not even a Christian.
That doesn't matter.

03:17.564 --> 03:20.366
Honey, the two of you can still
make a promise not to have sex.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.168
And that way, I would
feel a lot more comfortable

03:22.236 --> 03:24.904
about your going to a sleepover
camp where he is for six weeks.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.739
Mom, I can't ask him to make that promise.

03:26.807 --> 03:30.009
Why not? The question is, why?

03:30.077 --> 03:33.546
Grace, this probably isn't gonna be the guy
you're gonna be with for the rest of your life.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.315
Okay, but what if there isn't a guy I'm
gonna be with for the rest of my life?

03:36.383 --> 03:39.485
What, am I just supposed to not
have sex for the rest of my life?

03:39.553 --> 03:41.254
I was fine with abstinence

03:41.321 --> 03:44.023
when I was 16, and it was
Jack and me, but...

03:44.091 --> 03:45.358
Hi.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.894
Um, I'm taking off tomorrow.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.562
I just wanted to let you know.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.297
So, what are we talking about? Abstinence?

03:51.365 --> 03:52.965
I can't wait till I can have

03:53.033 --> 03:54.934
a private conversation with my
mother without you listening in.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.303
I overheard. I wasn't listening in.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.305
And I'm all for
abstinence, if we're voting.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.240
I'm all for going back to that.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.575
Are you really?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.210
'Cause I heard that
you and Madison were...

04:04.278 --> 04:06.212
I'm not making that same mistake twice.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.147
I'm not gonna tell you what
Madison and I are doing.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.782
I already told her.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.117
Great. Thanks.

04:11.185 --> 04:14.320
So, Jack, you feel that
you and Madison made a mistake,

04:14.388 --> 04:16.956
you and Grace made a mistake.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.624
It's my mistake to make.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.427
And we do not need to ask Jack for
permission for me to have sex with Grant.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.163
It's too soon. It's way too soon,
isn't it, Kathleen?

04:24.231 --> 04:26.766
I mean, Mrs. Zegay.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.334
I'm not making that promise,

04:28.402 --> 04:30.570
and I'm not asking Grant
to make that promise.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.238
I knew you were up to something

04:32.306 --> 04:34.707
when you let him come over last night.

05:14.758 --> 05:16.693
I'm giving you two minutes to get dressed

05:16.760 --> 05:18.828
and get out here, and
then I'm taking you home.

05:18.896 --> 05:21.264
And if I don't?
I'm calling your parents.

05:21.332 --> 05:23.967
And where are you going to tell them I am?

05:24.034 --> 05:25.702
Why are you doing this?

05:25.769 --> 05:28.037
I have to go to work. Geez, Ashley.

05:29.940 --> 05:32.942
I hadn't planned on doing this...
on just showing up here.

05:33.010 --> 05:34.944
I had planned on having a
little more time to do this

05:35.012 --> 05:38.248
in my own space, in my own time,
before Amy got back from new York.

05:38.315 --> 05:40.250
I am not gonna have sex with you, Ashley.

05:40.317 --> 05:43.253
Why not? I know you've been
having sex with other women.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.954
If you're sleeping around,
why not sleep with me?

05:45.022 --> 05:46.289
For a long list of reasons.

05:46.357 --> 05:48.358
I don't wanna be the
first guy you sleep with.

05:48.425 --> 05:51.527
You're supposed to wait until you meet
the right guy, a guy you're in love with,

05:51.595 --> 05:53.796
a guy you wanna be with the rest
of your life and sleep with him.

05:53.864 --> 05:54.998
Yeah.

05:55.065 --> 05:56.966
No, I am not that guy.

05:57.034 --> 05:58.468
I think you are.

05:58.535 --> 06:00.470
Maybe I could've been or would've been

06:00.537 --> 06:02.906
or even should've been, but I'm not.

06:02.973 --> 06:05.241
Ashley, your sister and I
have a son together.

06:05.309 --> 06:08.111
I wanna see if we can be a family...
the three of us.

06:08.178 --> 06:10.647
And give every girl hope that if she
gets pregnant, the guy will marry her?

06:10.714 --> 06:13.716
This is not about every
girl or woman or whatever.

06:13.784 --> 06:16.286
This is just about Amy and me and John.

06:16.353 --> 06:18.388
And I know that most of the time,

06:18.455 --> 06:20.390
an unplanned pregnancy does not result

06:20.457 --> 06:23.126
in one big happy family, but couldn't it?

06:23.193 --> 06:25.295
Oh, come on. You don't wanna
be married when you're 17.

06:25.362 --> 06:27.630
I'm almost 18. And no,

06:27.698 --> 06:31.401
I don't wanna be married
right away, or at all.

06:31.468 --> 06:33.336
But maybe I should at least try

06:33.404 --> 06:35.505
getting to know the mother
of my son, don't you think?

06:35.572 --> 06:37.874
Look, I really want to do this.

06:37.942 --> 06:41.477
I just wanna... Get it over with,

06:41.545 --> 06:44.247
and you're the guy I wanna
get it over with with.

06:44.315 --> 06:46.683
You can't have sex just
to get it over with.

06:46.750 --> 06:47.684
Yes, I can.

06:47.751 --> 06:49.619
Not with me. I'm taking you home,

06:49.687 --> 06:51.854
and you can explain this
to your parents and Amy.

06:51.922 --> 06:53.456
You're not taking me anywhere.

07:00.597 --> 07:03.499
Come on. It's about the attitude.
You just gotta own it.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.501
Do you wanna try this on
and see if you can own it,

07:05.569 --> 07:07.670
'cause I don't think I can own it.

07:07.738 --> 07:10.707
I can own it, maybe.

07:10.774 --> 07:13.443
Hey, I'm really, really happy
that you guys stopped by,

07:13.510 --> 07:15.945
but John's gonna wake up
from his nap any minute,

07:16.013 --> 07:19.148
so I can't really hang
out until you go to work.

07:19.216 --> 07:21.551
Come on. We haven't seen
you in almost four weeks.

07:21.618 --> 07:23.319
You have to tell us what's going on.

07:23.387 --> 07:24.821
Yeah. What's happening with Ricky?

07:24.888 --> 07:27.056
I don't know. You gonna have sex with him?

07:27.124 --> 07:28.691
Madison. Are you?

07:28.759 --> 07:30.393
I don't know. But I do know

07:30.461 --> 07:32.195
that we're gonna try to get
to know each other better.

07:32.262 --> 07:34.664
By doing it. Come on, Madison.

07:34.732 --> 07:38.167
I think we're just gonna do
what, you know, you two are doing.

07:38.235 --> 07:39.836
You mean what Jack and I are doing?

07:39.903 --> 07:41.404
'Cause those two don't do anything.

07:41.472 --> 07:43.840
You and Jack
aren't doing anything either.

07:43.907 --> 07:45.708
Not now.

07:45.776 --> 07:48.378
What I meant was Ricky and
I are going to try dating.

07:48.445 --> 07:51.681
Just dating. I've never really
been on a date before, ever.

07:53.784 --> 07:54.884
What?

07:54.952 --> 07:56.886
You're gonna date the father of your baby?

07:56.987 --> 07:59.055
Yes, I am. What about Ben?

07:59.123 --> 08:01.557
If he asks you out, are you
gonna go out with him, too?

08:01.625 --> 08:04.093
I'm gonna call Ben and ask him
to meet me somewhere and talk.

08:04.161 --> 08:06.062
And that's all I wanna
say about it for now, okay?

08:06.130 --> 08:08.364
When? When are you gonna talk with Ben?

08:08.432 --> 08:09.999
When I can, all right?

08:10.067 --> 08:12.201
When he's available
and wants to talk to me.

08:12.269 --> 08:14.670
I don't wanna tell you what I
wanna tell him before I tell him.

08:14.738 --> 08:16.005
That wouldn't be fair to Ben.

08:16.073 --> 08:17.573
Hey, you know what?

08:17.641 --> 08:19.509
Maybe Ashley's over at Ben's.

08:19.576 --> 08:20.910
It is a great place to hide out.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.478
I doubt Ashley's over at Ben's.

08:22.546 --> 08:24.447
I don't know where she is,
but I doubt she's at Ben's.

08:24.515 --> 08:27.550
Maybe she's over at Ricky's.

08:35.491 --> 08:36.926
There you are. Sorry.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.760
Amy got home last night,
and I just got back here.

08:38.828 --> 08:41.731
Oh. So, what's Amy's
sister doing upstairs?

08:41.799 --> 08:44.100
She, um... she's looking
for something for John.

08:44.168 --> 08:46.235
What's going on? Nothing.

08:46.303 --> 08:48.204
Nothing, huh?

08:48.272 --> 08:50.173
She took my extra key I had at their house

08:50.240 --> 08:52.608
and let herself in,
and I can't get her out.

08:52.676 --> 08:54.610
So I'll just leave her up there.

08:54.678 --> 08:56.112
Eventually she'll have to go home.

08:56.180 --> 08:57.580
What's she doing up there?

08:57.648 --> 08:59.048
She ran away from home.

08:59.116 --> 09:01.417
She didn't get very far. No, she didn't.

09:01.485 --> 09:04.587
Please tell me nothing's going
on with you and Amy's sister.

09:04.655 --> 09:07.023
No, there's not.

09:07.091 --> 09:08.458
What?

09:08.525 --> 09:10.293
I look at the security tapes.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.495
You know I look at the security tapes.

09:12.563 --> 09:14.430
Why do you keep bringing women up here

09:14.498 --> 09:16.299
knowing I look at the security tapes?

09:16.366 --> 09:18.734
What women? You know what women.

09:18.802 --> 09:22.105
I know what women. I'm trying.

09:24.842 --> 09:26.576
Hi, Amy.

09:26.643 --> 09:28.111
I was gonna call you.

09:28.178 --> 09:31.280
You get 60 seconds,
and not a second longer.

09:33.016 --> 09:35.585
<i>Is Ashley over there?
Yeah, she's over here.</i>

09:35.652 --> 09:37.587
I got here and she was here.

09:37.654 --> 09:40.323
I told her to go home, and she's not
going. At least that's what she says.

09:40.390 --> 09:42.792
What's she doing there?

09:42.860 --> 09:45.595
Oh. I guess I know what she's doing there.

09:45.662 --> 09:49.432
She said she just wants to, you
know, do it and get it over with.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.267
That's what she said. Wasn't that long ago

09:51.335 --> 09:52.935
I was saying the same thing to my friends.

09:54.505 --> 09:56.439
I'm sorry, but I can't talk. I'm at work.

09:56.507 --> 09:57.974
Good morning.

09:58.041 --> 10:00.143
Yeah. Good morning. What's going on?

10:00.210 --> 10:02.612
Amy's home. She came
back a few days early.

10:02.679 --> 10:03.980
Oh?

10:04.047 --> 10:05.915
Yeah. She got in late last night.

10:05.983 --> 10:09.418
That's interesting. I didn't
expect her back so soon.

10:09.486 --> 10:11.120
I didn't expect you back so soon, either.

10:11.188 --> 10:13.356
I didn't come to ask for my job back.

10:13.423 --> 10:17.126
I just came by to thank you for
letting me work here with you.

10:17.194 --> 10:18.961
I really learned a lot.

10:19.029 --> 10:21.764
Like you can't attack
another employee at work?

10:23.500 --> 10:25.234
That, and I learned

10:25.302 --> 10:28.671
that jobs are not a
right, they're a privilege,

10:28.739 --> 10:31.007
especially when working
for someone so experienced

10:31.074 --> 10:34.310
and knowledgeable and patient

10:34.378 --> 10:37.280
and kind and...Pretty.

10:37.347 --> 10:38.948
You can go now.

10:43.153 --> 10:44.453
Careful.

10:44.521 --> 10:47.623
You don't wanna cross any
sexual harassment lines.

10:47.691 --> 10:48.624
You were saying?

10:48.692 --> 10:50.293
I need some advice.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.428
I have to earn $50,000 fast.

10:52.496 --> 10:53.796
For?

10:53.864 --> 10:56.599
A...Friendship ring.

10:58.068 --> 11:00.102
No friendship ring costs 50 grand.

11:00.170 --> 11:01.837
You're getting engaged.
You're gonna marry Adrian?

11:03.407 --> 11:06.242
The last person that shoved
a person no longer works here.

11:06.310 --> 11:08.244
And he said, "friendship ring."

11:08.312 --> 11:11.614
Nobody said anything about marriage.

11:11.682 --> 11:14.016
$50,000 for a friendship ring?

11:14.084 --> 11:16.319
Are you getting married?

11:16.386 --> 11:18.688
You're not getting married.
I might be getting married.

11:18.755 --> 11:20.189
Why? Why?

11:20.257 --> 11:21.657
You two don't even know each other.

11:21.725 --> 11:23.893
Yeah, well, maybe we should've
thought about that earlier,

11:23.961 --> 11:26.662
but at least we're thinking about it
before you and Amy thought about it.

11:26.730 --> 11:28.864
Bunny, I need to run an errand.

11:28.932 --> 11:30.900
Where are you going?

11:30.968 --> 11:32.835
You better not be going to Adrian's.

11:47.384 --> 11:48.351
George?

11:48.418 --> 11:49.885
Ashley was over at Ricky's apartment.

11:49.953 --> 11:52.488
Oh, good. He found her.

11:52.556 --> 11:54.457
But that's not why I'm calling.

11:54.524 --> 11:57.059
Why you calling? I was
just thinking about us.

11:57.127 --> 11:59.328
About getting married and the wedding.

11:59.396 --> 12:01.197
You don't wanna know what
Ashley was doing over at Ricky's?

12:01.265 --> 12:03.299
Okay, fine. What was Ashley
doing over at Ricky's?

12:03.367 --> 12:04.834
I don't know. Amy went
over there to get her.

12:04.901 --> 12:08.170
Good. That's good, I guess.

12:08.238 --> 12:10.473
Look, you've been so generous lately

12:10.540 --> 12:12.708
with offering to hand over the business

12:12.776 --> 12:14.744
while you stay at home with robie and cook

12:14.811 --> 12:16.312
and take care of
the house and...

12:16.380 --> 12:17.513
thank you.

12:17.581 --> 12:19.482
You're welcome.

12:19.549 --> 12:21.217
And I was just thinking

12:21.285 --> 12:23.519
that every time you've
been generous in the past,

12:23.587 --> 12:25.187
it's been because you
were hiding something.

12:26.790 --> 12:28.658
And I just came across

12:28.725 --> 12:31.827
some very interesting
entries in the books here,

12:31.895 --> 12:35.698
and... I'm suspicious.

12:35.766 --> 12:37.700
I wish I weren't, but I am.

12:37.768 --> 12:38.901
Suspicious of what?

12:38.969 --> 12:41.904
You don't wanna get married, do you?

12:41.972 --> 12:44.106
If you did wanna get married,
you wouldn't want me to know

12:44.174 --> 12:46.375
that you cheated... again.

12:56.718 --> 12:57.685
Ben.

12:57.753 --> 12:59.920
Amy.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.222
Hi.

13:01.289 --> 13:04.291
Hi. And, um, hi, John.

13:04.359 --> 13:06.727
He's gotten bigger
since the last time I saw him.

13:06.795 --> 13:09.897
Yeah. He gets bigger every day,

13:09.965 --> 13:12.667
which is a really stupid thing to say.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.937
Geez, I don't know why this is so awkward.

13:17.039 --> 13:19.407
I mean, I do know why, but...

13:19.474 --> 13:20.908
How've you been? I've been okay.

13:20.976 --> 13:22.610
How is Adrian? How's she doing?

13:22.678 --> 13:25.546
She had a little scare yesterday,
but, uh, she's all right.

13:25.614 --> 13:27.281
It was nothing. Oh.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.217
I'm sorry about the scare.
I'm happy she's doing fine.

13:31.987 --> 13:34.588
I'd love to sit down and talk with you,

13:34.656 --> 13:36.624
but I have to go upstairs.

13:36.692 --> 13:38.726
Amy, we should talk.

13:38.794 --> 13:40.094
Yeah, we should talk.

13:40.162 --> 13:41.696
Um, coffee this afternoon?

13:41.763 --> 13:43.564
You drink coffee now?

13:43.632 --> 13:46.967
We have to go out for coffee, like
two people who just met on the Internet

13:47.035 --> 13:49.003
or through a dating service or something?

13:49.071 --> 13:51.405
You can't just come over to my
house, or I can't come over to yours

13:51.473 --> 13:53.874
like we've done a hundred
times before? All right.

13:53.942 --> 13:56.143
Well, uh, come over to
my house around 3:00,

13:56.211 --> 13:57.645
when John takes his nap, if you want.

13:57.713 --> 13:58.646
All right.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.214
Come on, John.

14:02.384 --> 14:05.219
If you're looking for Ricky,
I think he might be at Adrian's.

14:05.287 --> 14:07.788
I know that. He texted me.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.894
All right. I'll tell you what.

14:13.962 --> 14:15.930
I'll talk to your dad
about giving your job back,

14:15.997 --> 14:17.998
but you're not gonna be
able to save 50 grand,

14:18.066 --> 14:21.302
so you might as well just take back
that friendship ring and be enemies.

14:21.369 --> 14:24.038
I'm not sure I can take a $50,000 ring

14:24.106 --> 14:26.107
off the finger of the
woman who's having my baby,

14:26.174 --> 14:27.775
especially since I gave it to her.

14:27.843 --> 14:29.877
Was there anybody around
when you gave it to her?

14:29.945 --> 14:32.079
Because if there were no witnesses,

14:32.147 --> 14:34.115
then the matter of whether
you gave it to her or not

14:34.182 --> 14:35.483
is just hearsay.

14:35.550 --> 14:36.684
Her doctor was present.

14:36.752 --> 14:39.286
Ta-da! You lose.

14:44.793 --> 14:46.560
Come in.

14:50.899 --> 14:54.668
Look, John. It's aunt Ashley
trying to have her own baby.

14:54.736 --> 14:55.669
Not really.

14:55.737 --> 14:57.805
Go get your toys, John.

14:58.874 --> 15:00.341
So what are you doing here?

15:01.743 --> 15:04.011
Well, didn't Ricky tell
you? Of course he did.

15:04.079 --> 15:05.679
Well, he doesn't tell
you everything, you know.

15:05.747 --> 15:08.716
He doesn't have to. He really
doesn't have to tell me everything.

15:08.784 --> 15:11.352
He did tell me that you wanna have
sex because you wanna get it over with.

15:11.419 --> 15:12.987
So?

15:13.054 --> 15:15.956
So, so do a lot of girls, Ashley.

15:16.024 --> 15:17.658
They just wanna be like everyone else.

15:17.726 --> 15:19.994
They wanna have sex to
be like everyone else.

15:20.061 --> 15:22.363
News flash... not every
teenager is having sex.

15:22.430 --> 15:25.099
And I'm not just talking about
the teens who don't get offers.

15:25.167 --> 15:28.369
I'm talking about the teens who consciously
decide that it's not the best thing

15:28.436 --> 15:30.471
because they're too young
or because they're not ready

15:30.539 --> 15:32.506
or whatever reason they
choose not to have sex.

15:32.574 --> 15:35.843
Oh, no. You haven't become an
expert in teen sex, have you?

15:35.911 --> 15:38.445
I mean, I knew you were an expert
in pregnancy and motherhood.

15:38.513 --> 15:40.047
But now sex, too? Amazing.

15:40.115 --> 15:42.082
Obviously I don't know anything about sex

15:42.150 --> 15:43.651
or I wouldn't have John.

15:43.718 --> 15:46.287
But crazy as it is, I was thinking
the same thing you're thinking

15:46.354 --> 15:47.955
when I went off to band camp.

15:48.023 --> 15:49.456
Now look at me. I'm a teen mother.

15:49.524 --> 15:51.859
Do you wanna be a teen mother?
No one wants to be a teen mother.

15:51.927 --> 15:53.661
Of course not. That's why I'm on the pill.

15:53.728 --> 15:55.663
Why, Ashley? Why are you doing this?

15:55.730 --> 15:57.698
Is it to get back at me?
You're not doing this

15:57.766 --> 16:00.000
to get back at me for getting to
Ricky first or something, are you?

16:00.068 --> 16:03.137
No. It's just that...

16:03.205 --> 16:05.639
I don't think he'd be interested in
you if you hadn't gotten pregnant.

16:07.242 --> 16:08.843
I think he'd be interested in me.

16:08.910 --> 16:11.178
Or at least he could be interested in me,

16:11.246 --> 16:14.215
but you got pregnant, so...

16:14.282 --> 16:15.716
There. I said it.

16:15.784 --> 16:18.185
You wanna know why that doesn't bother me?

16:19.721 --> 16:23.257
Because I said that same thing
to myself over and over again--

16:23.325 --> 16:26.727
the part about Ricky not being interested
in me if I hadn't gotten pregnant.

16:26.795 --> 16:29.096
And every girl who finds
herself in this situation

16:29.164 --> 16:32.166
asks herself the same thing,
probably for her entire life.

16:32.234 --> 16:33.534
Of course, that's not the worst thing.

16:33.602 --> 16:35.069
The worst thing is when a guy and a girl

16:35.136 --> 16:36.604
really care about each other,

16:36.671 --> 16:38.739
then the guy hates her because
she finds out she's pregnant,

16:38.807 --> 16:41.508
feels trapped, takes off.

16:41.610 --> 16:44.211
There's really nothing good about
getting pregnant when you're a teenager.

16:44.279 --> 16:46.747
I'm sorry. I may have gone
a little too far with that.

16:46.815 --> 16:48.782
No, it's okay.

16:48.884 --> 16:51.118
It was honest.

16:51.186 --> 16:54.088
Maybe what you said is true. I don't know.

16:54.155 --> 16:56.891
That's why I'm gonna see if Ricky
and I really do care about each other,

16:56.958 --> 16:59.827
and that's why you're going to
stay away from him, okay, Ashley?

17:01.263 --> 17:04.632
You and I really don't need
to hurt each other anymore.

17:04.699 --> 17:06.834
Just go home. Come on, John.

17:07.969 --> 17:09.904
I just wanna see what the big deal is.

17:09.971 --> 17:11.704
Okay?

17:11.772 --> 17:13.773
That's all I want.

17:13.842 --> 17:15.643
I wanna know why...

17:15.710 --> 17:17.711
why girls are willing
to risk getting pregnant

17:17.779 --> 17:19.880
when they haven't even had a
chance at living their own life yet.

17:21.316 --> 17:23.250
I wanna know why girls and
guys are willing to risk

17:23.318 --> 17:25.886
getting infections and diseases that
will last the rest of their lives

17:25.954 --> 17:28.555
just so they can have sex.

17:28.623 --> 17:30.724
And I wanna know why grown men and women

17:30.792 --> 17:33.027
will risk their entire families
just so they can have sex

17:33.094 --> 17:34.628
with someone outside of their marriage.

17:36.665 --> 17:38.632
I just want...

17:38.700 --> 17:41.335
I wanna see what's so great about it.

17:41.403 --> 17:43.103
I wanna know why is it
that people will take

17:43.171 --> 17:44.805
all of those risks just to have sex.

17:44.873 --> 17:47.374
Are you thinking of any grown
men and women in particular?

17:47.442 --> 17:50.311
No. You weren't thinking
of, say, mom and dad?

17:50.378 --> 17:52.313
No, of course not. Mom and
dad are getting married again.

17:52.380 --> 17:54.381
Yeah, but what if they don't?
Well, why wouldn't they?

17:54.449 --> 17:57.618
I don't know. I'm sure you do.

18:04.228 --> 18:05.728
I care enough about you to tell you

18:05.796 --> 18:07.630
that that would be a
really stupid thing to do.

18:07.698 --> 18:09.132
And why is that? Didn't you tell me

18:09.200 --> 18:11.034
a couple days ago that maybe
Ben and I should get married?

18:11.101 --> 18:13.770
I didn't mean it. And you
don't wanna get married.

18:17.044 --> 18:19.311
Are you really gonna make
another mistake? Are you?

18:19.379 --> 18:20.813
What... what are
you talking about?

18:20.881 --> 18:23.516
I'm talking about you and Amy.

18:23.583 --> 18:26.786
Look, I think they taught those girls in
new York how to trap their baby's dads.

18:26.853 --> 18:28.788
So you could be getting
married and not even know it.

18:28.855 --> 18:30.823
No one has said anything
about getting married.

18:30.891 --> 18:33.325
You're not thinking about
getting married, really?

18:33.393 --> 18:36.662
Maybe. Like, years from now.
Many, many years from now.

18:36.730 --> 18:39.832
And did you tell Amy that...
the "many years from now" part?

18:39.900 --> 18:41.934
My conversations with
Amy are just that...

18:42.002 --> 18:43.436
conversations with Amy.

18:43.503 --> 18:45.371
They're private and personal,

18:45.439 --> 18:47.506
just like I hope this
conversation between the two of us

18:47.574 --> 18:49.008
will stay just between the two of us.

18:49.076 --> 18:51.844
Sure. Fine with me.

18:51.912 --> 18:56.148
But, well, also, just between me and you,

18:56.216 --> 18:59.351
you're going along with getting to know Amy
just so you can have sex with her, aren't you?

18:59.419 --> 19:00.386
No, I'm not.

19:00.454 --> 19:01.987
I bet you would even marry her

19:02.055 --> 19:04.323
just so you can have sex with her,

19:04.391 --> 19:05.658
whether you wanna marry her or not

19:05.725 --> 19:07.460
or whether you think you'll
be faithful to her or not.

19:09.229 --> 19:10.830
You know what?

19:10.897 --> 19:13.199
I just realized something about Ben.

19:13.266 --> 19:15.668
Something else I really like about Ben.

19:17.270 --> 19:20.673
I never have to worry about
Ben cheating on me, ever.

19:20.740 --> 19:23.275
Unless, of course, I don't marry Amy.

19:23.343 --> 19:26.412
You know, maybe I'll get to
know her, and I won't like her.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.048
I think what you mean is
maybe she'll get to know you,

19:29.116 --> 19:30.549
and she won't like you.

19:36.690 --> 19:38.924
Even though

19:38.992 --> 19:40.893
I know you're completely loveable

19:42.796 --> 19:44.930
and you could really love a girl

19:44.998 --> 19:47.399
and be faithful to her,

19:47.467 --> 19:49.768
I always believed that...

19:49.836 --> 19:52.771
I just...

19:52.839 --> 19:55.274
I just always believed
that it would be me.

19:55.342 --> 19:57.877
And do you still want it to be you?

20:00.947 --> 20:02.314
Hey, angel face, how's it going?

20:02.382 --> 20:03.716
I can help you with that.

20:03.783 --> 20:05.417
Oh. Thank you.

20:05.485 --> 20:06.752
So how'd it go with ash?

20:06.820 --> 20:08.621
Good. Really good.

20:08.688 --> 20:11.423
I don't know if you want to hear
this or not, but, uh, I think Ricky...

20:11.491 --> 20:13.926
is over at Adrian's. I know that.

20:13.994 --> 20:16.295
He told me that he was going
over there to talk to her,

20:16.363 --> 20:18.764
and I told him that Ben was coming
over here later to talk to me.

20:18.832 --> 20:21.400
Hey, dad,

20:21.468 --> 20:23.402
how would I know if
Ricky was cheating on me?

20:23.470 --> 20:25.838
I mean, if we were ever,
like, boyfriend and girlfriend

20:25.906 --> 20:29.408
or ever even husband and wife.

20:29.476 --> 20:31.443
How would I know if he's cheating on me?

20:31.511 --> 20:33.546
He'd be over at Adrian's talking.

20:33.613 --> 20:35.314
Wouldn't that be a hint
he's cheating on you?

20:35.382 --> 20:37.149
There's no cheating on me for now.

20:37.217 --> 20:39.351
We're not exclusive.
We're not, like, planning

20:39.419 --> 20:41.453
on getting married like you and mom.

20:41.521 --> 20:42.955
We're just dating,

20:43.023 --> 20:45.691
and it doesn't mean he
can't date anyone else.

20:45.759 --> 20:47.726
He can see anyone he
wants to and so can I.

20:47.794 --> 20:50.095
That's a nice arrangement.
I hope it works.

20:50.163 --> 20:52.565
Yeah. Me, too.

20:52.632 --> 20:54.733
But, really, how would a person know

20:54.801 --> 20:57.870
if the other person's cheating?

21:02.142 --> 21:04.843
I guess you would notice that

21:04.911 --> 21:07.780
even though he does all the right things

21:07.847 --> 21:10.583
and he says all the right things

21:10.650 --> 21:12.585
and he tries really hard
to make everyone happy

21:12.652 --> 21:15.788
because he really wants
everyone to be happy...

21:15.855 --> 21:18.891
I guess you would notice that

21:18.959 --> 21:21.093
he's not really happy because
his heart just isn't in it.

21:22.529 --> 21:23.796
I noticed.

21:25.165 --> 21:27.633
I really did.

21:27.701 --> 21:31.337
Amy, I'd like to speak to
your dad, please, alone.

21:38.845 --> 21:41.280
So you went so far as to
get a marriage license?

21:41.348 --> 21:43.816
What, were you just gonna wait
until you were in front of the judge

21:43.883 --> 21:45.784
to tell me that you changed your mind?

21:45.852 --> 21:48.821
I wasn't gonna change my
mind. I was gonna get married.

21:48.888 --> 21:51.790
I figured once I was locked
in, I was locked in... this time.

21:51.858 --> 21:54.193
Ah, I see.

21:54.261 --> 21:56.195
So you sabotaged the wedding plans

21:56.263 --> 21:58.731
by putting some very interesting
receipts into the books at work

21:58.798 --> 22:01.467
knowing that I would
come across them. Wrong.

22:01.534 --> 22:03.936
I'm not really that calculating.

22:04.004 --> 22:06.839
I forgot about the receipts.

22:06.906 --> 22:08.841
In the back of my mind,
I think I had some thought

22:08.908 --> 22:10.843
about going through the
books again before you did,

22:10.910 --> 22:13.345
but I just didn't.

22:13.413 --> 22:16.181
And all that stuff was old, from
last summer while you were away.

22:16.249 --> 22:18.751
I didn't know what was gonna
happen. It was a long time ago.

22:21.221 --> 22:23.989
Not that it doesn't count, but
hey, we're not married, remember?

22:24.057 --> 22:27.159
Yeah, I remember.

22:27.227 --> 22:30.329
And I'm kind of relieved
that this happened.

22:30.397 --> 22:35.901
Relieved and confused and hurt.

22:35.969 --> 22:37.803
But mostly relieved.

22:37.871 --> 22:39.805
I figured I would go
along with what you wanted

22:39.873 --> 22:43.275
because it would be best for
our son and for our family.

22:43.343 --> 22:45.611
But now I don't
know if that's true...

22:45.679 --> 22:48.147
if it's best for two people
to get married or stay married

22:48.214 --> 22:51.116
for the children when
they shouldn't be married.

22:51.184 --> 22:53.118
And we shouldn't be married, George.

22:54.254 --> 22:56.155
We really shouldn't.

22:56.222 --> 22:59.224
But like you, I thought that if
I just committed to the marriage,

22:59.292 --> 23:01.927
if I tried really, really hard
to do all the right things,

23:01.995 --> 23:04.930
I could make it work.

23:04.998 --> 23:07.866
But now I can't.

23:07.934 --> 23:09.902
Or, more importantly, I don't want to.

23:09.969 --> 23:12.671
What do you wanna do, Anne? What's next?

23:13.907 --> 23:15.874
Well, I have some ideas.

23:15.942 --> 23:19.545
I'd love to hear them. I
mean, if you're talking to me.

23:19.612 --> 23:21.880
I'll always be talking to you.

23:21.948 --> 23:24.516
Not talking to you would
hurt robie and Ashley and Amy,

23:24.584 --> 23:26.885
and I don't wanna hurt anyone.

23:26.953 --> 23:29.388
I really don't. Me, neither, Anne.

23:29.456 --> 23:30.923
Well, we'll just have to figure this out.

23:30.990 --> 23:32.891
I agree.

23:32.959 --> 23:34.560
Can we still be friends?

23:34.627 --> 23:36.428
Absolutely.

23:36.496 --> 23:38.430
All right.

23:38.498 --> 23:41.667
Well, we'll see how we can best split
up with as little damage as possible.

23:52.371 --> 23:54.205
Wow.

23:54.273 --> 23:57.575
Wow, this is some, uh...

23:57.643 --> 23:59.977
What is it that you call
this? A friendship ring.

24:00.045 --> 24:03.147
Yeah, this is some friendship ring.

24:03.215 --> 24:06.117
Thank you. Do you want a piece of fruit?

24:06.185 --> 24:09.487
I'm just gonna have a tangerine. You
know, they're filled with vitamin c.

24:09.555 --> 24:11.989
Yeah, sure. I'd love a tangerine.

24:12.057 --> 24:14.225
You wouldn't...

24:14.293 --> 24:16.527
you wouldn't be thinking about
getting married, would you?

24:16.595 --> 24:19.197
No. No, we're just...

24:19.264 --> 24:22.967
we're thinking about thinking
about getting married.

24:23.035 --> 24:26.170
But first, we're gonna be
friends, get to know each other

24:26.238 --> 24:28.005
and see what happens.

24:28.073 --> 24:29.707
Anything can happen.

24:29.775 --> 24:31.342
You wouldn't get married in High School?

24:31.410 --> 24:34.011
Well, I'm having a baby
in High School, so...

24:34.079 --> 24:37.048
So, you still wanna go
to college and law school?

24:37.115 --> 24:39.684
Well, yeah, but that doesn't
mean I can't go to school married.

24:39.751 --> 24:42.486
But having a baby's gonna
make that a real challenge.

24:42.554 --> 24:43.988
I guess.

24:44.056 --> 24:46.324
But, well, I'm going on a, you know,

24:46.391 --> 24:47.792
boykewich scholarship.

24:47.860 --> 24:50.161
Leo says they will definitely
help me go to school.

24:50.229 --> 24:53.164
Isn't that great? Yes, that's great.

24:53.232 --> 24:55.399
I mean, I guess I feel

24:55.467 --> 24:57.535
like maybe you'd have a
greater sense of accomplishment

24:57.603 --> 24:59.003
if you paid for it on your own

24:59.071 --> 25:02.273
or if you got a scholarship
based on your grade point average.

25:02.341 --> 25:03.841
But... but that's great.

25:03.909 --> 25:07.078
Grace, I really care about Ben,

25:07.145 --> 25:09.614
and Ben really cares about me, and,

25:09.681 --> 25:11.616
well, we both really care about the baby.

25:11.683 --> 25:15.286
You know Ben's going over to Amy's
this afternoon at 3:00 to talk?

25:15.354 --> 25:18.055
I'm okay with that.

25:18.123 --> 25:21.225
And you wanna know why I'm okay with that?

25:21.293 --> 25:23.194
Because we're friends.

25:24.596 --> 25:26.264
So, my mom wants me to promise her

25:26.331 --> 25:28.232
that I won't have sex
with grant this summer.

25:28.300 --> 25:30.301
However, when I came
into the house last night,

25:30.369 --> 25:32.270
I told her all about our conversation,

25:32.337 --> 25:34.272
and she said if we wanted
to continue talking,

25:34.339 --> 25:36.040
he could come over.

25:36.108 --> 25:37.875
So he came over,

25:37.943 --> 25:41.279
and he spent the night
in my room, on the floor.

25:41.346 --> 25:44.582
Wow. Fun.

25:44.650 --> 25:47.418
Yeah, it was fun. Why
would she let grant do that?

25:47.486 --> 25:49.553
I've been thinking about that,
and I think she's leading up

25:49.621 --> 25:51.455
to asking me to put the
promise ring back on again.

25:51.523 --> 25:52.790
Like you did with Jack.

25:52.858 --> 25:54.792
Yeah, like I did with Jack.

25:54.860 --> 25:57.495
But the thing is, when someone
tells you not to do something,

25:57.562 --> 25:59.931
it just makes doing it
seem so much more fun.

25:59.998 --> 26:01.632
Being bad is fun.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.100
Are you kidding me?

26:03.168 --> 26:05.102
Oh. Yeah.

26:05.170 --> 26:07.171
It's not always fun, I guess.

26:07.239 --> 26:10.374
You guess? Come on, grace. How many
of your friends have to get pregnant

26:10.442 --> 26:12.677
before you realize this is not what
you want for yourself in High School?

26:12.744 --> 26:15.413
It's just when someone
tells you not to do something

26:15.480 --> 26:19.083
that you know is really, really fun,

26:19.151 --> 26:21.519
it just makes it seem more fun.

26:21.586 --> 26:22.687
Or not.

26:22.754 --> 26:24.455
Adrian, I'm not gonna get pregnant.

26:25.924 --> 26:26.857
I'm not.

26:26.925 --> 26:28.326
Oh, like I meant to do this?

26:30.228 --> 26:32.763
It's something I feel very strongly about.

26:32.831 --> 26:34.332
And if grace's dad were alive,

26:34.399 --> 26:36.367
he would feel very strongly about it, too.

26:36.435 --> 26:39.870
My parents think it's okay if I
have sex as long as I'm careful.

26:39.938 --> 26:42.173
Well, I don't think it's
okay. I think it's wrong.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.842
Based on what, if you
don't mind my asking?

26:44.910 --> 26:48.579
I mean, as long as we're having an
open discussion, which is kind of cool.

26:48.647 --> 26:50.548
I've never done this before
with someone else's parents.

26:50.615 --> 26:53.818
Yeah. Well, I've never done this
before with someone else's son.

26:53.885 --> 26:55.553
But I don't know how cool it is.

26:55.620 --> 26:57.722
But to answer "based on what,"

26:57.789 --> 26:59.690
it's based on my own personal beliefs.

26:59.758 --> 27:01.726
Your religious beliefs? Yeah.

27:01.793 --> 27:04.128
With all my faults, I
consider myself a Christian.

27:05.430 --> 27:07.732
Grace told you about my past?

27:07.799 --> 27:09.233
I don't know anything about your past.

27:09.301 --> 27:11.369
But she told me you like...

27:11.436 --> 27:12.837
Some things.

27:14.873 --> 27:17.508
What about grace's personal
beliefs, my personal beliefs?

27:17.576 --> 27:18.876
We may not believe what you believe.

27:18.944 --> 27:20.878
Okay, but here's what I believe.

27:20.946 --> 27:23.848
It's just really not something
you should do outside of marriage

27:23.915 --> 27:26.017
or a committed relationship
before you're even old enough

27:26.084 --> 27:28.252
to be in a committed relationship.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.553
Says who? God?

27:29.621 --> 27:32.056
Says me, your girlfriend's mother.

27:33.325 --> 27:35.259
Okay, forget personal beliefs.

27:35.327 --> 27:37.695
How about it's just not good common sense

27:37.763 --> 27:41.365
for young adults in High School
to have sex with multiple partners?

27:41.433 --> 27:43.601
I mean, besides the
risk of getting pregnant

27:43.668 --> 27:46.203
or an infection that can last a lifetime,

27:46.271 --> 27:49.673
sex can take an emotional
toll on a young woman

27:49.741 --> 27:52.109
or a young man.

27:52.177 --> 27:56.113
Grant, I don't want you to
have sex with my daughter.

27:56.181 --> 27:57.815
Not even...

27:57.883 --> 28:00.584
Gateway sex? She told me.

28:00.652 --> 28:03.587
I know that this is
gonna be grace's decision

28:03.655 --> 28:05.856
and your decision,

28:05.924 --> 28:07.858
but would you please wait?

28:07.926 --> 28:10.227
Please don't run off to
med camp and have sex.

28:14.199 --> 28:15.633
'Kay.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.234
"'Kay"?

28:17.302 --> 28:18.936
If you feel that strongly about it.

28:19.004 --> 28:20.905
I feel strongly about that, too.

28:22.107 --> 28:24.742
We're still talking
about abstinence, right?

28:24.810 --> 28:27.812
Yeah. Yeah, but this time,
someone's actually listening.

28:27.879 --> 28:29.980
You know why?

28:30.048 --> 28:33.818
Because I really want this
relationship with grace to work out,

28:33.885 --> 28:36.487
unlike your relationship with grace.

28:55.874 --> 28:57.007
Hi.

28:57.075 --> 28:59.777
Hi. Come in. Let's go in the living room.

29:10.489 --> 29:12.089
I made some lemonade.

29:12.157 --> 29:14.492
I picked up some wings today
just for old time's sake.

29:14.559 --> 29:17.261
Remember the first time
we had wings together?

29:17.329 --> 29:19.964
Uh, yeah, I remember.

29:23.902 --> 29:26.837
I remember it well. It was
the day I proposed to you.

29:26.905 --> 29:30.341
I can't
believe you proposed to me.

29:30.408 --> 29:33.310
I can't believe we actually
got illegally married.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.814
Yeah.

29:36.882 --> 29:40.451
I didn't meet one other
teenage mother in that program

29:40.519 --> 29:42.453
who was that lucky.

29:42.521 --> 29:45.022
I feel really, really lucky, Ben.

29:45.090 --> 29:47.024
I managed to get through
my entire pregnancy

29:47.092 --> 29:48.659
and the first year of John's life

29:48.727 --> 29:50.327
without losing my closest friends,

29:50.395 --> 29:53.330
without losing my family,

29:53.398 --> 29:55.399
without dropping out of school.

29:55.467 --> 29:57.368
I really am the luckiest
person in the world.

29:57.435 --> 30:00.704
Okay. And?

30:00.772 --> 30:04.141
And I just wanted to
tell you face-to-face

30:04.209 --> 30:06.710
how much I appreciate
everything you did for me.

30:06.778 --> 30:07.711
Thank you.

30:07.779 --> 30:08.712
You're welcome.

30:12.217 --> 30:15.219
What's going on here? I
don't know what's going on.

30:15.287 --> 30:17.221
Not much more than that really.

30:17.289 --> 30:19.123
I just wanted to say thank you.

30:19.191 --> 30:20.891
That's the least I owe
you, don't you think?

30:20.959 --> 30:22.660
I guess.

30:22.727 --> 30:24.695
I don't think that you owe me anything.

30:24.763 --> 30:27.198
Do you think we could be friends,

30:27.265 --> 30:29.200
even though you're gonna
have a baby with Adrian,

30:29.267 --> 30:31.168
and even though I'm gonna try

30:31.236 --> 30:33.404
to have some kind of a real
relationship with Ricky?

30:33.471 --> 30:35.039
You mean a sexual relationship?

30:35.106 --> 30:37.241
Why does everyone always ask me that?

30:37.309 --> 30:39.577
Probably because any
relationship with Ricky

30:39.644 --> 30:42.513
would require sex.

30:42.581 --> 30:45.616
And I don't like the idea of that.

30:45.684 --> 30:48.285
Although, I suppose, at this point,

30:48.353 --> 30:50.421
it's really none of my business.

30:50.488 --> 30:52.923
It's really not. Yeah, I guess not.

30:52.991 --> 30:56.560
So, I'm just gonna see how it goes.

30:56.628 --> 30:58.562
We don't have to feel
all weird and anxious

30:58.630 --> 31:00.097
every time we bump into each other.

31:00.165 --> 31:03.033
No. We don't have to.

31:03.101 --> 31:06.437
I don't know if it's gonna
happen right away, but, um,

31:08.006 --> 31:10.040
I think you should know

31:10.108 --> 31:12.743
that I'm thinking about marrying Adrian.

31:15.046 --> 31:16.947
Oh.

31:17.015 --> 31:18.983
Yeah, I, uh... I didn't know.

31:19.050 --> 31:20.851
Yeah. Um...

31:20.919 --> 31:22.853
I'm... I'm just thinking about it.

31:22.921 --> 31:24.855
I gave her a ring.

31:24.923 --> 31:28.425
Not an engagement ring.
More like a friendship ring.

31:29.995 --> 31:32.630
It's really hard to know
what to do in this situation.

31:34.032 --> 31:36.166
I like Adrian.

31:36.234 --> 31:39.637
I like her a lot. But do I love her?

31:41.206 --> 31:43.374
Could I love her?

31:43.441 --> 31:45.376
Maybe.

31:45.443 --> 31:48.879
I mean, there are arranged
marriages all over the world,

31:48.947 --> 31:50.881
and at least some
percentage of those people

31:50.949 --> 31:53.150
have to be happy, right?

31:53.218 --> 31:55.452
Yeah, I suppose so.

31:58.256 --> 32:01.892
I thought this would kind
of be a clean start for us

32:01.960 --> 32:05.696
in that maybe we could just be friends

32:05.764 --> 32:08.132
and be okay with that, but...

32:10.568 --> 32:12.503
It feels more like a clean ending.

32:16.207 --> 32:19.076
I, uh...

32:19.144 --> 32:22.079
I guess I should go now

32:22.147 --> 32:24.748
while I still have the strength
to make myself leave this place

32:24.816 --> 32:28.319
and...You.

32:36.761 --> 32:38.629
Bye, Ben.

32:40.398 --> 32:42.366
I guess I'll see you around.

32:42.434 --> 32:44.501
I guess we'll see each other around.

33:34.253 --> 33:36.888
I just thought I'd stop by. Is that okay?

33:36.923 --> 33:39.524
Yeah, that's okay. Come in.

33:45.598 --> 33:49.567
So, um, how'd it go with Amy?

33:49.602 --> 33:52.704
Grace told me you were over there.

33:52.738 --> 33:55.674
Fine. I just thought
I'd drop by and see you.

33:55.708 --> 33:58.743
I said, I know you were over at Amy's.

33:58.778 --> 34:00.111
Grace told me.

34:00.146 --> 34:03.615
Yes, I was over there, and now I'm here.

34:03.649 --> 34:06.084
You want the ring back.

34:06.118 --> 34:07.819
Yeah, the ring.

34:07.853 --> 34:09.688
How is the ring?

34:09.722 --> 34:13.458
It's, um, still the ring.

34:13.492 --> 34:16.161
The same gigantic,

34:16.195 --> 34:18.730
beautiful sparkly ring
that you gave to me.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.931
I'm happy you like it. I love it.

34:20.967 --> 34:22.867
That's good,

34:22.902 --> 34:25.103
because I'm gonna pay Betty for it.

34:25.137 --> 34:27.304
I'm gonna buy it from her. Really?

34:27.340 --> 34:29.074
Yeah. I think maybe I should.

34:29.108 --> 34:31.476
And you know what? I want to.

34:31.510 --> 34:35.447
Um, it's probably a really expensive ring.

34:35.481 --> 34:37.248
Yeah.

34:37.283 --> 34:39.650
I don't know how expensive, of course.

34:39.685 --> 34:43.420
About 50 grand, for insurance purposes.

34:43.456 --> 34:47.257
What?

34:47.293 --> 34:48.259
Yeah.

34:48.293 --> 34:50.061
Um, okay. You know what?

34:50.096 --> 34:51.896
You take this back right now

34:51.931 --> 34:53.831
before I lose it or something.

34:53.866 --> 34:56.167
It's really nice, but I can't accept it.

34:56.202 --> 34:58.803
You know what? No, I'm
not gonna take it back.

34:58.838 --> 35:01.906
I'm gonna find a way to pay for
it, because I want you to have it.

35:01.941 --> 35:04.876
Even if we're never more than
friends, I want you to have it.

35:04.910 --> 35:08.046
Even if it takes me 20 years,
I want that ring to be yours.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.647
No! Yes.

35:09.682 --> 35:11.683
Okay. Thank you.

35:11.717 --> 35:13.518
But are you sure?

35:13.552 --> 35:16.554
I would really hate to start off
this little project we have in debt.

35:16.589 --> 35:19.190
We're already in debt.

35:19.225 --> 35:22.193
We owe it to this baby to be
the best parents that we can be

35:22.228 --> 35:24.929
for who we are at this time in our lives.

35:28.100 --> 35:30.769
I don't know, Ben boykewich.

35:30.803 --> 35:33.138
If you keep saying things like that to me

35:33.172 --> 35:36.875
and giving me expensive jewelry,

35:36.909 --> 35:39.377
maybe I could fall in love with you.

35:40.246 --> 35:42.514
Maybe you could.

35:57.430 --> 35:59.164
All right, buddy. I'm taking off.

35:59.198 --> 36:02.067
I'm going to see my parents, then
I'll be coming back for football camp.

36:02.101 --> 36:05.270
But I'll be getting in pretty late every
night. Yeah, yeah. Have a nice trip.

36:05.304 --> 36:06.938
Are you gonna stay out
here while I'm gone?

36:06.972 --> 36:09.941
Who wants to know? All right, all right.

36:09.975 --> 36:12.043
Do you wanna come with
me to see my parents?

36:12.078 --> 36:15.380
I can't. Have to find a job.

36:22.254 --> 36:23.855
Uh, good afternoon.

36:25.324 --> 36:27.926
Is, uh... is this guy, like,
your personal bodyguard, Tommy?

36:27.960 --> 36:29.427
I keep seeing him everywhere.

36:29.462 --> 36:32.730
Yeah, maybe I am Tom's personal
bodyguard. What do you want?

36:32.765 --> 36:34.399
Uh, can I come in?

36:34.433 --> 36:36.067
Come in.

36:36.102 --> 36:38.169
Listen,

36:39.638 --> 36:42.640
I wanted to let you know that I got a job.

36:42.675 --> 36:45.643
A real job. I mean, I am...

36:45.678 --> 36:47.712
well, I'm back on top, baby, okay?

36:47.746 --> 36:49.047
My old partner... he came to me.

36:49.081 --> 36:52.083
Wants to start a new company.
Totally legit all the way.

36:52.118 --> 36:54.252
Good for you,

36:54.286 --> 36:56.855
but still, I don't have a job.

36:56.889 --> 36:58.623
Yeah, nice of you to come
all this way to rub it in.

36:58.657 --> 37:01.192
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Have a
little faith, young fellas.

37:01.227 --> 37:03.061
I didn't come here to rub it in.

37:03.095 --> 37:06.197
I came here to share my good fortune.

37:06.232 --> 37:09.901
Tommy, how would you
like to be vice president

37:09.935 --> 37:11.402
at investment central?

37:11.437 --> 37:13.905
Vice President of the company?

37:13.939 --> 37:16.274
No, no. Not the whole company, Tom.

37:16.308 --> 37:18.910
See, that would require
an advanced education

37:18.944 --> 37:22.447
and some expertise and know-how
based on a body of work.

37:22.481 --> 37:25.416
Vice president of what?

37:25.451 --> 37:28.186
Well, what else? Human resources.

37:28.220 --> 37:30.788
Hr, baby. The job starts Monday.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.794
Thanks. I accept.

37:36.829 --> 37:38.630
Good.

37:38.664 --> 37:41.799
The whole compan.

37:41.834 --> 37:43.735
What did you do that for?

37:43.769 --> 37:45.203
Your mom asked me to.

37:45.237 --> 37:47.672
No. I wanna do what we were gonna do.

37:47.706 --> 37:49.340
What were we gonna do?

37:49.375 --> 37:52.610
You know. We were going to explore

37:52.645 --> 37:54.879
our feelings for each other.

37:54.914 --> 37:57.448
We can still do that.
We just can't have sex,

37:57.483 --> 37:59.651
oral or otherwise, for the next six weeks.

37:59.685 --> 38:01.085
It's just six weeks.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.887
We'll have plenty of other
things to do at med camp.

38:02.922 --> 38:04.522
Like what?

38:04.557 --> 38:06.858
Like...Study.

38:06.892 --> 38:09.427
It's not that easy. At
least it wasn't for me.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.296
It was for me.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.765
Oh, yeah? Where'd you come
out at the end of the summer?

38:13.799 --> 38:15.433
What do you mean, where'd I come out?

38:15.467 --> 38:16.801
Nothing.

38:18.204 --> 38:21.306
I heard they put out rankings
at the end of the session

38:21.340 --> 38:22.774
just like they do at med school.

38:22.808 --> 38:24.609
No, they didn't. Yeah, they did.

38:24.643 --> 38:26.211
They're still on the web site... the rankings.

38:26.245 --> 38:28.613
How'd I do? Good.

38:28.647 --> 38:30.648
Not as well as I did, but good.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.483
I never knew you were so competitive.

38:32.518 --> 38:34.018
Yeah, I am.

38:34.053 --> 38:36.120
I was fifth, and you were 23rd.

38:37.256 --> 38:40.558
Out of 125, so that's still really good.

38:40.593 --> 38:43.695
But we should both focus on our
studies for the next six weeks,

38:43.729 --> 38:45.196
not that we can't still see each other.

38:45.231 --> 38:46.598
No, of course not.

38:46.632 --> 38:48.633
We just can't touch each other.

38:48.667 --> 38:50.702
What happens in six weeks when
we come home from med camp?

38:50.736 --> 38:52.036
I don't know.

38:52.071 --> 38:53.605
Maybe we should ask my mother.

38:53.639 --> 38:55.940
I can't have another
conversation like that again.

38:55.975 --> 38:57.942
I barely got through this
one. I only got through it

38:57.977 --> 39:00.712
because I gave her my word
that we wouldn't do anything.

39:00.746 --> 39:03.581
Well, I promised her and my dad before

39:03.616 --> 39:05.416
that I wouldn't do anything,

39:05.451 --> 39:08.052
but then I did it, so...

39:08.087 --> 39:10.521
So you can't keep your promises?

39:10.556 --> 39:13.625
Yes, I can keep my promises.

39:13.659 --> 39:15.660
Come on. Let's keep
my promise to your mom.

39:15.694 --> 39:17.762
It'd be a good way for us to
start out, don't you think?

39:17.796 --> 39:20.131
Did she convert you to christianity, too?

39:20.165 --> 39:22.166
I want her to like me. Why?

39:22.201 --> 39:24.002
Because she's your mom, and I like you.

39:24.036 --> 39:25.570
Just not enough to do it?

39:25.604 --> 39:27.171
I feel kind of pressured here.

39:27.206 --> 39:30.141
I've never been in this
situation. All right. Okay.

39:30.175 --> 39:31.843
No sex this summer.

39:31.877 --> 39:34.512
So, we still talking about abstinence?

39:41.720 --> 39:43.855
You're starting to bother
me less and less, Jack.

39:45.658 --> 39:47.859
I'm leaving. I just
wanted to say good-bye.

39:47.893 --> 39:49.060
Bye.

39:49.094 --> 39:50.228
See you.

39:55.934 --> 39:59.370
I better be going, too. I'll
pick you up in the morning.

39:59.405 --> 40:01.306
We're off for a summer at med camp.

40:01.340 --> 40:03.741
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

40:07.813 --> 40:09.981
Wait. You were fifth?

40:10.015 --> 40:11.649
Yeah.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.364
What's that look on your face?

40:26.398 --> 40:28.032
That's not a good look.

40:28.967 --> 40:31.035
Yeah, it's not a good look.

40:31.070 --> 40:33.738
I can't hide anything from you.

40:34.707 --> 40:37.308
Did you come to say good-bye?

40:37.343 --> 40:39.444
No, I didn't come to say good-bye.

40:39.478 --> 40:42.747
Your mom and I wanna talk to you and Amy.

40:42.781 --> 40:45.249
Well, you and mom are completely clueless,

40:45.284 --> 40:48.986
because John and Amy just
left to go out with Ricky

40:49.021 --> 40:50.788
on their first date.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.657
All right. Well,

40:52.691 --> 40:54.726
we were hoping that we
could have dinner as a family

40:54.760 --> 40:56.461
and talk.

40:56.495 --> 40:58.930
Because no matter what, we're a family.

40:58.964 --> 41:01.733
Maybe a different kind of family
than we've been, but a family.

41:05.704 --> 41:07.605
Well, I hatemy to
tell you this, dad,onight.

41:07.639 --> 41:11.376
But Amy, Ricky, and John...
they're a family, too.

41:11.410 --> 41:13.344
Their own different kind of family.

41:13.379 --> 41:15.346
We'll see, ash. We'll see how that goes.

41:15.381 --> 41:17.081
Yeah, we'll see how it all goes.

41:18.484 --> 41:21.119
No, don't say anything.

41:21.153 --> 41:23.755
Amy and I made a pact to
get through this together.

41:23.789 --> 41:25.757
Get through what? I don't know,

41:25.791 --> 41:28.826
but whatever it is,

41:29.728 --> 41:31.763
it can wait one more day.

42:01.293 --> 42:03.327
Say hi to daddy, John.

42:03.362 --> 42:06.497
You look really nice, Amy.

42:07.666 --> 42:11.068
Thank you. You look really nice, too.

42:13.372 --> 42:15.239
Should I come in?

42:15.274 --> 42:18.276
Oh, yeah. Of course. Come in.

42:19.411 --> 42:21.913
Okay, buddy. Hey, go get your toys.

42:26.318 --> 42:28.319
You look really nice.

42:29.688 --> 42:32.457
You said that. But, again, thank you.

42:32.491 --> 42:34.659
You gonna go around looking
like that all the time?

42:34.693 --> 42:36.394
I don't know.

42:36.428 --> 42:38.896
I learned a few things in new York.

42:38.931 --> 42:41.632
It's our first date, kind
of. I wanted to look special.

42:41.667 --> 42:45.436
You are special, Amy.

42:45.471 --> 42:49.740
And... and you don't want
to have another kid, do you?

42:49.775 --> 42:51.676
Because I don't know

42:51.710 --> 42:53.945
if I can stay away from you
if you're gonna look like that.

42:53.979 --> 42:58.015
Maybe in a few months you
won't have to stay away from me.

42:58.050 --> 43:00.551
We'll see how it goes with you
and all the women in your life.

43:00.586 --> 43:02.520
Yeah. We'll see.

43:38.891 --> 43:39.891
Hi.

43:39.925 --> 43:41.459
Hi.

43:41.493 --> 43:43.094
I'm happy to have you home.

43:43.128 --> 43:44.762
I'm happy to be home.
