02:08.971 --> 02:11.338
What's gucci?

02:11.340 --> 02:12.839
Hm?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.775
Yo! Are you deaf?

02:14.777 --> 02:16.710
Me and Arman,
are just friends.

02:16.712 --> 02:17.945
There's nothing to worry about.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.515
Oh, no-no-no.
I'm-I'm not worried, girl.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.584
I know my boyfriend would never
touch a FOB like you.

02:27.623 --> 02:28.956
I hear your mom is "cray".

02:30.659 --> 02:32.559
Everyone knows what she did
at her last job...

02:32.561 --> 02:34.328
legit nuts.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.299
I'm just wondering, how can
someone do something like that?

02:39.301 --> 02:41.735
Going out onto the streets
yelling at their customers

02:41.737 --> 02:43.670
like that? Part naked?

02:43.672 --> 02:45.372
I mean, I think that she should
be sent

02:45.374 --> 02:46.940
to a fuckin' looney house.

02:46.942 --> 02:49.643
- You with me, girls?
- Yeah.

02:49.645 --> 02:51.011
Tell me I'm wrong?

02:52.281 --> 02:54.248
You can't, you know it's true.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.016
You know what I like best
about working with Arman?

02:57.786 --> 03:00.320
His talent at certain things.

03:15.638 --> 03:17.437
Get the fuck off me!

03:21.877 --> 03:23.810
<i>Bitch!</i>

03:25.681 --> 03:27.848
You have come
to the right place.

03:30.452 --> 03:34.454
Our company uses uh, state
of art, "Univer" material.

03:36.558 --> 03:39.393
If you're looking for something
that will withstand heat,

03:39.395 --> 03:41.428
then this is it.

03:45.467 --> 03:48.702
Ah, granite is often used
in Italian restaurants

03:48.704 --> 03:50.804
where open concept oven

03:50.806 --> 03:52.839
heats up everything around it.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.577
The fire...

03:57.579 --> 03:59.546
<i>Jasna, can you come in
here for a minute, please?</i>

04:07.022 --> 04:09.056
Hi.

04:09.058 --> 04:10.791
Sit, please.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.965
Maybe one day,
when you're ready,

04:18.967 --> 04:20.767
you can also go back to school?

04:22.738 --> 04:24.471
I-I have been practicing

04:24.473 --> 04:26.840
um, customer relations.

04:26.842 --> 04:28.342
Would you like to hear it?

04:28.344 --> 04:30.610
I'm very happy to hear
about your enthusiasm.

04:30.612 --> 04:32.946
But remember what we said:

04:32.948 --> 04:35.082
that observing is the best way
to learn for now.

04:35.084 --> 04:37.451
And studying the manual
and uh...

04:38.587 --> 04:40.654
this is just gonna
help people know

04:40.656 --> 04:42.622
that you're new.

04:44.026 --> 04:45.559
Oh.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.729
Here, let me-let me help you.

05:00.909 --> 05:03.643
- Ah, that's it?
- That's it.

05:17.126 --> 05:19.760
<i>Yeah, but we've had
this conversation before.</i>

05:19.762 --> 05:22.062
What do I say about
construction standards?

05:22.064 --> 05:23.897
Site inspections
are happening tomorrow,

05:23.899 --> 05:26.133
<i>crappy work just won't cut it.</i>

05:26.135 --> 05:28.835
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:28.837 --> 05:31.838
Is there anything in
particular you're looking for?

05:31.840 --> 05:34.908
- Uh, yes.
- Hello, hello, Mr. McKay!

05:34.910 --> 05:36.977
- Hi Linda.
- Hi.

05:36.979 --> 05:39.045
I assume you're here about
the Richmond condo projects?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.747
- Well, yes, yes.
- Wonderful.

05:40.749 --> 05:42.082
Right this way. Thanks.

05:43.452 --> 05:45.452
Oh, so we've switched to Univer
materials

05:45.454 --> 05:46.953
- since you were last here.
- Aha.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.789
Well, you know I'm looking
for top of the line, right?

05:48.791 --> 05:51.024
- Oh, this is it!
- Good.

05:51.026 --> 05:53.527
<i>Show me what you got.</i>

06:04.206 --> 06:06.173
<i>Univer sucks.</i>

06:07.810 --> 06:09.176
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

06:09.178 --> 06:10.944
I don't wanna intrude
or anything,

06:10.946 --> 06:13.013
but I personally...

06:13.015 --> 06:15.549
I-I would never recommend.

06:16.819 --> 06:18.885
Thanks for clearing that up.

06:18.887 --> 06:21.688
Um I um,

06:21.690 --> 06:25.058
I specialize in complex
building structures.

06:26.195 --> 06:27.961
So I don't know, maybe...

06:27.963 --> 06:30.931
if I can help.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.833
Where's that beautiful
accent from?

06:32.835 --> 06:34.468
Serbia.

06:35.537 --> 06:36.837
Well, thank you.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.674
Thank you.

06:42.478 --> 06:45.011
<i>Settle down,
please.</i>

06:45.013 --> 06:47.547
<i>Welcome back to Personal
Planning class,</i>

06:47.549 --> 06:50.951
<i>where we discuss life after
graduation. Your future.</i>

06:50.953 --> 06:54.054
<i>Now, I know you're only here
for another six months,</i>

06:54.056 --> 06:55.956
<i>but your next steps
after high school</i>

06:55.958 --> 06:57.824
<i>are something you should be
thinking about.</i>

06:57.826 --> 06:59.926
<i>Work experience can help.</i>

06:59.928 --> 07:03.697
<i>You will be expected
to observe your subject,</i>

07:03.699 --> 07:06.766
<i>and occasionally help out
if the opportunity arises.</i>

07:06.768 --> 07:08.602
Child labour.

07:16.245 --> 07:17.978
Nina.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.579
I already talked
to the counsellor.

07:19.581 --> 07:21.081
I know. It's not just
about that. All right?

07:21.083 --> 07:23.683
Now, why haven't I received
a proposal from you?

07:23.685 --> 07:25.886
I already have a job,
I don't need another one.

07:25.888 --> 07:28.588
This is not about another
temporary after-school job.

07:32.861 --> 07:34.594
<i>I'll have that replaced.</i>

07:34.596 --> 07:36.530
- It's okay, I don't care.
- I know it's not easy

07:36.532 --> 07:38.565
being back in grade 12.

07:38.567 --> 07:40.534
I know all your friends
are gone.

07:40.536 --> 07:42.636
And I know it's been
a hard year.

07:42.638 --> 07:44.804
But I hate to see all your
creativity go to waste.

07:46.742 --> 07:48.608
Remember those impressions
you did in class

07:48.610 --> 07:50.644
that made everyone laugh?

07:52.548 --> 07:54.748
Okay. I got it.

08:53.775 --> 08:55.675
That's $200.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.083
Darling, you're home.

09:10.792 --> 09:12.708
Just in time!

09:15.458 --> 09:20.542
You can help me pick out what
I'm going to wear tonight.

09:24.958 --> 09:27.042
Where did I leave that?

09:31.250 --> 09:32.333
What happened?

09:32.375 --> 09:33.792
- Nothing.

09:35.625 --> 09:37.042
What do you mean, nothing?

09:37.375 --> 09:38.792
Come over here.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.042
Show me.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.000
- It's nothing.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.917
Tomorrow, I'm going to your school.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.042
- I said it's nothing!

09:46.583 --> 09:48.750
I'll teach those thugs.
- Let's just eat.

09:49.917 --> 09:51.958
We can order Chinese?

09:55.137 --> 09:57.137
Mmm. Mmm.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.042
How was work?

10:04.375 --> 10:05.708
- Linda's an idiot.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.375
Remember what the social worker
said?

10:12.054 --> 10:14.888
Do well at your day job,
and earn your place.

10:14.890 --> 10:16.356
Rebuild your life.
- Of course, honey.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.042
Come here.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.018
What do you think?

10:27.096 --> 10:28.304
What's the occasion?

10:28.375 --> 10:29.750
Dinner with a friend.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.083
You mean drinks?

10:31.625 --> 10:34.667
- I said dinner. Are you a
little deaf?

10:34.708 --> 10:35.750
- Didn't I say dinner?

10:38.375 --> 10:40.542
Where are those shoes of mine?

10:42.833 --> 10:44.000
Did you take them?

10:44.042 --> 10:45.000
- No.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.333
What's wrong now?

10:46.375 --> 10:48.250
- Nothing. I'm not hungry.

10:48.833 --> 10:51.083
Where are you going?
Why don't you call Jessica?

10:51.125 --> 10:52.500
- She's at U of T!

11:01.958 --> 11:04.292
- If you fail the grade again,

11:06.458 --> 11:08.083
- I'm going to kill myself.

11:24.092 --> 11:26.459
I am living my dream...

11:26.461 --> 11:28.128
Oh yeah?

11:28.130 --> 11:29.462
working for Linda.

11:29.464 --> 11:30.930
Yeah, um...

11:30.932 --> 11:33.099
no, no, but actually,
you know, I'm...

11:33.101 --> 11:35.401
I do have some bigger ideas.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.037
and um I was actually thinking

11:38.039 --> 11:40.073
about this community project
center

11:40.075 --> 11:41.975
- Mhmm.
- that is about immigrants.

11:41.977 --> 11:44.210
And um, it is um...

11:44.212 --> 11:47.480
really important to me because
being an immigrant myself

11:47.482 --> 11:50.049
I-I think I understand
the particular needs

11:50.051 --> 11:52.185
- Mhmm.
- of what we need.

11:52.187 --> 11:54.287
And uh... thank you that's okay.

11:54.289 --> 11:56.456
You know, it's amazing to me
the cultural differences

11:56.458 --> 11:58.458
- between here and Belgrade.
- Mhmm.

11:58.460 --> 12:00.293
I was in Belgrade
a few years ago,

12:00.295 --> 12:02.195
as I was telling you,

12:02.197 --> 12:04.297
for the architectural design
convention.

12:06.468 --> 12:09.369
And the women, the women
everywhere

12:09.371 --> 12:11.805
were wearing these incredibly
high heels.

12:11.807 --> 12:13.473
- Everywhere.
- Oh, did they?

12:13.475 --> 12:14.941
- Am I right?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.409
- It's true.
- Mhmm.

12:16.411 --> 12:19.179
I mean, it's a great look.
Especially on you.

12:20.816 --> 12:22.482
- Thank you,
- Mhmm.

12:22.484 --> 12:24.450
but I'm not gonna sleep
with you.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.419
Ah, no, no, no, no.

12:27.989 --> 12:30.156
- It's not gonna happen.
- I wasn't going there.

12:30.158 --> 12:32.458
Okay. I'm just saying.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.461
I am interested in your work.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.564
Good. Oh, actually I can show
you something.

12:37.566 --> 12:39.599
- Sure.
- Great.

12:39.601 --> 12:42.335
Um, it's actually something
I'm really very proud of.

12:42.337 --> 12:46.039
It's one of my latest projects
that I did in Serbia.

12:47.275 --> 12:49.108
Voilà.

14:12.027 --> 14:15.261
- Oh, you're in real trouble.
- Oh yeah? Bring it on!

15:02.243 --> 15:04.077
Are you okay?
Did I do something?

15:06.247 --> 15:09.148
Why does everything has
to be so difficult?

15:09.150 --> 15:11.084
What do you mean?
What's difficult?

15:12.354 --> 15:13.987
Everything.

15:15.557 --> 15:18.358
I'm sorry. Please don't cry.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.128
Easy.

15:23.164 --> 15:24.630
Easy?

15:24.632 --> 15:26.466
Yeah. Yeah,

15:27.669 --> 15:29.569
it can be easy.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.006
It's what we make of it.

15:33.008 --> 15:35.541
That's right.

15:37.712 --> 15:39.579
Look, why don't you show me
that immigrant building project

15:39.581 --> 15:41.581
you were telling me about?

15:43.151 --> 15:46.652
Oh. You-you're interested
in that?

15:46.654 --> 15:48.354
- Yeah, of course.
- Really?

15:48.356 --> 15:49.489
- Yes.
- Yeah.

15:51.026 --> 15:53.126
- It would take me some time.
- Okay.

15:53.128 --> 15:55.061
Then whenever you're ready.

15:55.063 --> 15:57.363
Okay?

15:57.365 --> 15:59.298
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:02.270 --> 16:04.570
I got an early morning
at the construction site.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.305
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:08.276 --> 16:10.309
- I'll call the cab.
- Okay.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.792
Easy...

16:28.096 --> 16:29.595
I like that.

16:40.075 --> 16:43.176
Eleven... twelve... thirteen.

16:58.259 --> 16:59.492
Aw.

17:07.435 --> 17:09.235
Jasna.

18:05.593 --> 18:08.427
Morning!

18:10.365 --> 18:12.465
Finish this. Finish!

18:12.467 --> 18:14.767
♪ Must be nearly finished ♪

18:16.738 --> 18:18.671
Grain...

18:21.276 --> 18:23.209
Grain by grain.
Hello.

18:23.211 --> 18:25.411
Must be nearly finished.
Grain by grain.

18:25.413 --> 18:27.380
Okay stop!
Stop the scene!

18:27.382 --> 18:29.415
First of all,
Jesse, no peeking!

18:29.417 --> 18:31.384
Stanley, I want a bigger limp.

18:31.386 --> 18:33.886
And let me just remind you
there's a window stage right

18:33.888 --> 18:35.655
that you must go to first.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.423
Then stage left and straight
to him. Understand?

18:37.425 --> 18:38.824
Yeah. I-I get it.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.726
But what's wrong with being
a little free with this

18:40.728 --> 18:42.395
at this point,
just so we can figure out...

18:42.397 --> 18:44.012
Figure you're a little too
free.

18:44.014 --> 18:45.630
Ah, what about the singing? This
isn't music musical theatre.

18:45.633 --> 18:47.300
Fine. Fair.
I hear you, but...

18:47.302 --> 18:48.801
let me improvise a little bit.

18:48.803 --> 18:50.670
- So I can take this...
- Who are you to change-

18:50.672 --> 18:52.905
who are you to change Beckett's
script, Stanley?

18:52.907 --> 18:55.474
Save the improv
and exploring for warm up,

18:55.476 --> 18:56.909
These are small modifications...

18:56.911 --> 18:59.312
We're running out of time
here... Jesse.

18:59.314 --> 19:01.681
10 minute break and then
we'll go from the top again.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.750
- Hi. I'm Nina.
- Yes?

19:04.752 --> 19:06.586
Mrs. Fraser sent me
for job shadow.

19:06.588 --> 19:08.621
<i>Don't kick the can, Stanley!</i>

19:08.623 --> 19:10.690
I can't kick it's something
that may...

19:24.739 --> 19:26.672
Shadow, huh?

19:26.674 --> 19:28.841
That's what they call it.

19:28.843 --> 19:30.643
Oh she's a very good friend
of mine.

19:32.614 --> 19:34.480
So you want to be an actor?

19:34.482 --> 19:36.549
- No.
- A director?

19:38.586 --> 19:39.885
No?

19:41.689 --> 19:44.523
Send all the troublemakers
to the theatre, huh?

19:44.525 --> 19:46.359
- Thank you, Mrs. Fraser.
- I'm not gonna cause trouble,

19:46.361 --> 19:48.995
I'm just gonna sit in the back
and you can do your thing

19:48.997 --> 19:51.530
- and you can give me a mark.
- Don't worry, kid,

19:51.532 --> 19:53.733
we'll find something
for you to do.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.769
If I wanted to waste theatre
air, I'd get a plant.

20:00.341 --> 20:02.275
<i>Lights.</i>

20:06.781 --> 20:09.348
<i>Finished.</i>

20:09.350 --> 20:11.617
<i>Nearly finished.</i>

20:11.619 --> 20:13.619
<i>Must be nearly finished.</i>

20:14.889 --> 20:16.389
<i>Grain upon grain.</i>

20:16.391 --> 20:18.057
<i>One by one.</i>

20:18.059 --> 20:21.294
<i>And one day there is a heap,
a little heap.</i>

20:21.296 --> 20:23.062
<i>The impossible heap.</i>

20:24.999 --> 20:27.066
<i>I can't be punished anymore.</i>

20:27.068 --> 20:28.701
<i>I'll go to my kitchen.</i>

20:28.703 --> 20:31.470
<i>10 feet by 10 feet
by 10 feet.</i>

20:31.472 --> 20:33.539
<i>And wait for him to whistle me.</i>

22:01.629 --> 22:03.562
Yo!

22:03.564 --> 22:05.064
I heard you gave quite
the performance.

22:06.434 --> 22:07.900
I wouldn't call it
a performance.

22:07.902 --> 22:09.702
What? You haven't had this
for a while, have you?

22:09.704 --> 22:11.570
Ewww, Arman.

22:11.572 --> 22:13.939
Of course you haven't.
Saving it for some dude

22:13.941 --> 22:15.608
you haven't seen
for a year and a half.

22:15.610 --> 22:17.410
It's pathetic.

22:17.412 --> 22:19.111
I don't know why I even help
you anyway?

22:19.113 --> 22:21.781
Wait. Do you have anything
new for me?

22:22.817 --> 22:24.750
No, I haven't seen Bob.

22:24.752 --> 22:26.719
But maybe I can get you a few
more over the weekend...

22:26.721 --> 22:28.087
if you be good.

22:28.089 --> 22:30.089
Okay. I'm gonna need more.
And fast.

22:31.459 --> 22:33.492
You know what?
That's not to you. All right.

22:33.494 --> 22:35.928
It's a sensitive relationship
I've built with the guy.

22:35.930 --> 22:37.596
I can't just go knocking
on his door every time

22:37.598 --> 22:39.632
you feel that you need more.

22:39.634 --> 22:42.968
Arman... you're just the
middleman. You don't matter.

22:42.970 --> 22:45.037
Is that it? Huh?
I'm just the middleman?!

22:46.674 --> 22:48.174
And you're just some bitch
who needs to get laid!

22:48.176 --> 22:49.975
Don't worry, I will.

23:12.467 --> 23:13.966
What is this?

23:22.583 --> 23:24.500
- Pills made me sleepy again.

23:27.250 --> 23:29.375
Is this for the kitchen shop?

23:31.125 --> 23:32.875
This is for us.

23:32.917 --> 23:34.542
Another one of your projects?

23:34.583 --> 23:36.333
- But this is for us.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.250
Why are you being like that,
Nina?

25:05.880 --> 25:08.147
Ha! Ha! Ha!

25:08.149 --> 25:09.782
Ha!

25:09.784 --> 25:11.717
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

25:17.992 --> 25:19.091
<i>Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma.</i>

25:36.077 --> 25:37.876
Come here.

25:40.114 --> 25:41.747
No, leave your things.

25:41.749 --> 25:44.750
Okay, everyone,

25:44.752 --> 25:46.218
slowly find yourselves.

25:47.688 --> 25:50.656
And let's do an improv warm-up
with our newest member!

25:53.027 --> 25:54.860
I told you I didn't want
to be an actor.

25:54.862 --> 25:56.161
Oh, it doesn't matter.

25:56.163 --> 25:58.197
Everyone on the team
participates.

25:58.199 --> 26:00.666
- I'll turn off my phone.
- It's not about your Phone,

26:00.668 --> 26:02.301
it's about how I run the troupe.

26:09.644 --> 26:11.410
Go on.

26:24.392 --> 26:27.693
Ah gees,

26:27.695 --> 26:29.862
ah what are we...

26:29.864 --> 26:31.897
Oh, I got it.

26:31.899 --> 26:33.732
Careful.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.040
Hey kid,

26:41.042 --> 26:43.742
can you give me a hand
with this.

26:43.744 --> 26:46.245
Ah, come on.

26:46.247 --> 26:48.681
You take the rock,
it don't bite.

26:49.784 --> 26:52.017
Now, come on.

26:54.422 --> 26:56.388
Come on. Come on.

27:00.461 --> 27:02.961
Okay, scene!

27:04.198 --> 27:06.165
Let's take it from...

27:07.802 --> 27:09.702
Clov "It may end."

27:12.073 --> 27:13.939
Let's go now.

27:15.309 --> 27:17.876
<i>It may end. All life
long the same questions,</i>

27:17.878 --> 27:19.845
<i>the same answers.</i>

27:19.847 --> 27:22.081
<i>Go get me ready.</i>

27:22.083 --> 27:24.049
<i>Go and get the sheet.</i>

27:25.186 --> 27:28.020
- <i>Clov!</i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

27:28.022 --> 27:30.089
<i>I'll give you nothing
more to eat.</i>

27:30.091 --> 27:32.040
<i>Then we'll die.</i>

27:32.042 --> 27:33.992
<i>I'll give you just enough
to keep you from dying.</i>

27:33.994 --> 27:36.428
<i>You'll be hungry all the time.</i>

27:49.477 --> 27:51.210
That's $250.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.017
Thanks.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.036
Arman sent me.

28:20.174 --> 28:22.040
You go watch TV.

28:24.445 --> 28:26.478
I told you punks
not to come around here.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.447
I gave that little shit a bag
of phones a week ago.

28:33.487 --> 28:35.254
Can I have the rest now?

28:38.926 --> 28:40.993
Come on. I sold them all
in like a week.

28:57.111 --> 28:59.011
Don't mess around, neighbour.

29:55.708 --> 29:57.583
Please don't do this to us
again.

29:59.917 --> 30:02.000
Remember what happened last
time.

30:02.042 --> 30:03.667
With your last project.

30:04.333 --> 30:05.958
You ended up at a grocery store.

30:07.792 --> 30:09.917
Then in the psych ward.

30:11.875 --> 30:13.792
Forget about last time.

30:15.417 --> 30:17.333
This time I have Ben.

31:38.672 --> 31:40.472
Was there
drinking involved?

31:40.474 --> 31:42.607
Of course not!

31:44.078 --> 31:46.244
Why would you even
ask me that?

31:46.246 --> 31:48.547
I just wanted to make sure.

31:48.549 --> 31:51.249
You know that drinking
eliminates the effects

31:51.251 --> 31:53.018
of the medication.

31:53.020 --> 31:55.387
Your moods can start
shifting again.

31:55.389 --> 31:58.056
Everyone's mood shifts.

31:58.058 --> 32:01.093
I believe it's called...

32:01.095 --> 32:03.362
- human nature?
- Of course.

32:04.531 --> 32:07.065
But changes can be a little bit
more severe

32:07.067 --> 32:09.067
after everything that
you've gone through.

32:09.069 --> 32:13.005
The war, the unstable economic
situation,

32:13.007 --> 32:14.639
being a young mother...

32:14.641 --> 32:17.376
Nina...

32:17.378 --> 32:19.644
is the best thing I've
ever done in my life!

32:19.646 --> 32:21.513
Yes, of course.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.217
It's just that it was around
then

32:25.219 --> 32:27.686
that you started to experience
the mood swings,

32:27.688 --> 32:29.621
the instability...

32:29.623 --> 32:32.124
and finally,
you were diagnosed.

32:34.028 --> 32:35.627
I knew you would think that.

32:37.431 --> 32:40.599
Uh, I'm gonna be going. Uh...

32:42.169 --> 32:44.636
I could be doing better things.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.141
And what would you like to be
doing right now instead?

32:49.143 --> 32:52.644
I told you. I have a lot
of work to do on Easy Land

32:52.646 --> 32:55.280
before I hand it to Ben.

32:55.282 --> 32:58.550
Oh. I didn't know Benjamin
had given you a deadline.

32:58.552 --> 33:00.318
He didn't.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.521
I gave myself a deadline.

33:04.358 --> 33:08.260
Um, actually I-I have some
bills to pay

33:08.262 --> 33:11.797
and this project
is gonna help with that.

33:11.799 --> 33:13.565
I hope.

33:18.272 --> 33:20.105
Listen Doc um...

33:22.309 --> 33:25.077
I know you don't believe in me

33:26.146 --> 33:28.280
and that's quite all right.

33:28.282 --> 33:30.248
I really mean it.

33:33.253 --> 33:35.587
But please explain me one thing:

33:37.224 --> 33:39.758
why is it so wrong

33:39.760 --> 33:42.127
to feel things?

33:42.129 --> 33:44.162
To have emotions?

33:44.164 --> 33:46.364
What-what's wrong with that?

33:50.571 --> 33:53.271
I see that you are a highly
intelligent

33:53.273 --> 33:55.173
and talented woman, Jasna.

33:56.276 --> 33:58.410
And there's a part of your
disease

33:58.412 --> 34:00.779
that makes you feel that
you can achieve anything.

34:02.850 --> 34:07.152
You may feel really great,
sharp,

34:07.154 --> 34:10.188
ten times more productive
than usual...

34:12.126 --> 34:14.192
until you don't anymore.

34:14.194 --> 34:16.261
And then it gets ugly,

34:16.263 --> 34:19.898
it gets really ugly
really fast, doesn't it?

34:19.900 --> 34:22.601
- Hm?
- Mhmm.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.771
And that's why the medication
is so important.

34:30.811 --> 34:33.278
- I understand.
- Do you?

34:33.280 --> 34:34.579
I do.

34:35.849 --> 34:37.716
I really do.

34:40.487 --> 34:44.322
So now you can go
to government people

34:44.324 --> 34:47.759
and tell them that
I've been doing great.

34:47.761 --> 34:49.728
I am very proactive

34:49.730 --> 34:52.731
and contributing
to the community.

34:56.403 --> 34:57.636
- Jasna,
- Hmm?

34:58.839 --> 35:00.772
have you been taking
the medication

35:00.774 --> 35:02.641
that I prescribed for you?

35:03.677 --> 35:05.844
Of course.

35:07.314 --> 35:08.914
What?

35:08.916 --> 35:10.649
You don't believe me?

35:10.651 --> 35:12.851
Oh, it's not that
I don't believe you.

35:12.853 --> 35:14.920
It's just that I'm afraid that
if it goes untreated...

35:14.922 --> 35:16.688
Thank you, Doctor.

35:18.725 --> 35:21.326
- I-I appreciate that?
- Do you?

35:22.429 --> 35:24.296
Oh I do.

35:25.899 --> 35:28.733
- I'm trying... so hard.
- Mhmm.

35:29.937 --> 35:32.404
I'm...

35:32.406 --> 35:34.439
I'm doing my best.

35:40.247 --> 35:42.280
Are you with me, girls?

35:43.550 --> 35:46.518
Am I right, girls?

35:46.520 --> 35:47.919
Are you with me?

35:47.921 --> 35:49.988
Oh my God.

35:52.326 --> 35:55.393
Am I right, girls?
Am I right?

35:58.865 --> 36:00.599
<i>You're late.</i>

36:00.601 --> 36:02.767
Come on in.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.636
Take a seat beside me now.

36:10.677 --> 36:12.644
You two.

36:12.646 --> 36:14.479
You're in the same sinking ship.

36:14.481 --> 36:16.248
Take a look at the wall.

36:17.284 --> 36:18.650
What do you see?

36:18.652 --> 36:20.552
I see an exercise
for grade one students.

36:22.356 --> 36:23.755
Seriously, come on,

36:23.757 --> 36:25.590
this assignment is a waste
of time.

36:25.592 --> 36:28.058
Psychology has proven

36:28.060 --> 36:30.527
that sometimes we may need a
way to visualize our goals,

36:30.530 --> 36:32.998
otherwise they might seem
incomprehensible.

36:34.668 --> 36:36.801
<i>You two have one more week,</i>

36:36.803 --> 36:38.737
<i>brainstorm together.</i>

36:41.642 --> 36:43.308
All right. Well, sure.

36:43.310 --> 36:45.410
if the school pysch has proven
it works

36:45.412 --> 36:47.279
then, I wanna play
for La Liga,

36:47.281 --> 36:48.747
grow a new knee cap
that's not injured,

36:48.749 --> 36:51.983
and travel back in time.
Can I go now?

36:54.488 --> 36:57.389
Visualizing a real goal might
have helped your brother.

36:58.825 --> 37:01.026
<i>Please think about it.</i>

37:06.533 --> 37:08.466
Do you know how old he is?

37:10.037 --> 37:11.903
Like 19?

37:11.905 --> 37:14.339
Almost 21.

37:14.341 --> 37:16.441
Next year he'll be going
to adult school

37:16.443 --> 37:18.443
if he wants to finish grade 12.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.345
Do you wanna go to adult school?

37:20.347 --> 37:22.747
No, I'm going to Serbia.

37:22.749 --> 37:25.583
Then, perhaps you'll take
this last chance

37:25.585 --> 37:27.585
a little more seriously

37:27.587 --> 37:29.654
and actually help Greg.

38:57.477 --> 38:59.077
<i>When will she be
back, do you know?</i>

38:59.079 --> 39:01.179
<i>I don't know,
I just got home.</i>

39:01.181 --> 39:03.415
- Maybe she's at work.
- You must tell her,

39:03.417 --> 39:05.116
is no joke this time!
This time she very, very late.

39:05.118 --> 39:07.485
And she not pay gas bill
since in January.

39:07.487 --> 39:09.087
How do you think I feel?

39:09.089 --> 39:11.423
- Pretty bad.
- I'm finding new tenants.

39:11.425 --> 39:13.625
Wait.

39:18.031 --> 39:20.165
How is this to start?

39:20.167 --> 39:21.966
Give it back to her.

39:21.968 --> 39:24.702
Sunraj, give it back to her!

39:27.073 --> 39:31.209
You'll get everything by the
end of the week, as I promised.

39:31.211 --> 39:33.211
What's wrong with you, Sunraj,

39:33.213 --> 39:35.046
taking money from my child?

39:35.048 --> 39:37.682
Jasna, you must understand
debt is debt.

39:37.684 --> 39:39.884
You owe over $3,000.

39:39.886 --> 39:42.220
We had eviction hearing
last week,

39:42.222 --> 39:44.122
you didn't come, why?

39:44.124 --> 39:45.690
You know what that means?

39:45.692 --> 39:47.659
I have full right
to kick you out.

39:47.661 --> 39:50.094
Mr. Chopra, how long have
we known each other?

39:50.096 --> 39:52.564
Almost two years!

39:52.566 --> 39:54.833
I know I've been late
a few times,

39:54.835 --> 39:57.735
but have I ever not paid you?

39:57.737 --> 40:00.672
Mrs. Djuric,
I give you chance,

40:01.875 --> 40:04.209
one last chance -

40:04.211 --> 40:07.512
you pay by the end of the week
or I have no choice.

40:07.514 --> 40:09.547
- I call the police. Hm?
- I'll see you on Friday.

40:09.549 --> 40:11.182
Yes.

40:41.014 --> 40:42.947
<i>How much do we owe?</i>

40:42.949 --> 40:45.216
Don't worry about it.

40:45.792 --> 40:47.000
Go do your homework.

40:47.042 --> 40:48.708
Don't worry about it. I'm going
to take care of everything.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.542
- We were supposed to go
to Serbia this summer.

40:51.875 --> 40:54.042
But you fucked everything up.

40:54.083 --> 40:56.125
I didn't get to see my friends.

40:57.208 --> 40:59.958
I'll go back to Serbia myself
and stay at grandma's.

41:01.083 --> 41:03.167
Nina what's going on with you?

41:03.750 --> 41:05.333
You never tell me anything
anymore.

41:06.125 --> 41:08.208
Who hit you?

41:10.083 --> 41:13.458
It's their fault you hate it
here so much.

41:13.875 --> 41:15.958
Who did this to you?

41:17.500 --> 41:18.375
It's okay.

41:19.250 --> 41:21.458
Some girl Shandra, but I hit her
back.

41:22.667 --> 41:24.167
I wasn't a victim.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.625
Everything will be okay.

41:27.375 --> 41:29.375
All will be good.

41:32.833 --> 41:35.292
And you know what we'll do?

41:36.875 --> 41:40.583
We will create 'Nina's section'.

41:41.167 --> 41:42.792
You want to?

41:42.833 --> 41:44.500
That's what we'll do.

41:44.750 --> 41:45.417
Look...

41:46.250 --> 41:48.958
We'll put a part here for you.

41:49.792 --> 41:54.208
You just have to tell me what
you want and something you like.

42:02.042 --> 42:04.125
Yes, I'll let you know.

43:43.830 --> 43:46.230
Hi guys, you know
where Shandra is?

43:46.232 --> 43:48.266
- Right over there.
- Oh thanks.

43:52.806 --> 43:55.306
I know. It's just hard...
like I can't be here.

43:55.308 --> 43:58.209
Hey girls. Can you give us
a moment please.

43:58.211 --> 43:59.944
Thanks.

43:59.946 --> 44:01.979
- You Shandra?
- Yeah.

44:04.317 --> 44:06.417
You the one going around
hurting other people?

44:06.419 --> 44:07.952
Fuck off, lady.

44:07.954 --> 44:09.287
- Oh what was that?
- What the fuck?

44:09.289 --> 44:11.189
- Let me go.
- Oh sure I will.

44:11.191 --> 44:13.057
But first we're gonna have
a serious conversation

44:13.059 --> 44:14.759
about your behaviour.

44:14.761 --> 44:16.461
Okay. You're legit crazy!

44:16.463 --> 44:19.263
Oh, is that so?
Well, how about you, huh?

44:19.265 --> 44:21.933
Going around and hurting
other people?

44:21.935 --> 44:24.102
- Is that okay? Huh?
- No.

44:24.104 --> 44:25.870
- Hm? What?
- No.

44:25.872 --> 44:27.872
What was that?
What did you say?

44:27.874 --> 44:29.140
No, no, it's not.
It's not okay.

44:29.142 --> 44:31.943
It's not okay. Good.

44:35.081 --> 44:36.848
Don't make me come again.

44:42.922 --> 44:45.490
Oh, Mrs. Fraser.
Hi, how are you?

44:45.492 --> 44:48.059
- Great. How are you?
- Good. I'm Nina's mom.

44:48.061 --> 44:50.027
Nina's really progressing
at the theatre.

44:50.029 --> 44:51.896
You should be very happy.

44:51.898 --> 44:54.365
Oh. Good to know.
Thank you.

44:54.367 --> 44:56.234
- Bye bye.
- Hope everything's well.

44:56.236 --> 44:58.035
Bye.

45:05.311 --> 45:07.145
<i>Could you pass the salt?</i>

45:11.084 --> 45:12.483
Thank you.

45:19.025 --> 45:21.259
Hey, you want some
dessert?

45:22.495 --> 45:24.462
No, that's okay.

45:24.464 --> 45:27.331
But I baked this cake
just for you!

45:29.102 --> 45:31.102
Here...

45:31.104 --> 45:32.870
try some.

45:37.343 --> 45:41.279
Oh, come on, it's not that bad,
is it?

45:42.549 --> 45:45.216
- Jesse?
- Ah!

45:45.218 --> 45:47.418
You jerk.

45:47.420 --> 45:50.288
Here. Some milk.

45:50.290 --> 45:52.023
Oh, you got that right
into my eyes!

45:52.025 --> 45:53.925
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!

45:53.927 --> 45:55.927
Oh yeah.

45:55.929 --> 45:58.396
- Lenny is burnt.
- Stanley!

45:58.398 --> 46:00.965
Oh, no-no-no.

46:00.967 --> 46:03.901
Oh! It's mustard time!
Mustard time.

46:03.903 --> 46:06.103
Mustard time.

46:10.443 --> 46:12.310
- No, no, no, no, no.
- It's for you.

46:12.312 --> 46:14.111
Here. Oh no!

46:16.249 --> 46:17.615
You really got me.
You really got me

46:17.617 --> 46:19.016
Guys, you really got me.

46:19.018 --> 46:20.551
Oh, you really got me
on the chest, guys.

46:24.324 --> 46:26.290
Ahhh!

46:28.161 --> 46:30.294
- Ouch!
- That was good.

46:30.296 --> 46:33.164
Well, I never.

46:39.472 --> 46:41.339
<i>You know we're counting
on ticket sales, man,</i>

46:43.943 --> 46:46.210
<i>Oh man, we could really use
your help on tech week.</i>

46:48.047 --> 46:50.214
<i>Yeah, yeah,
we do have someone else,</i>

46:50.216 --> 46:52.516
but she's just-she's just a kid,
it's...

46:54.187 --> 46:56.621
it is no the same.

46:56.623 --> 47:00.124
<i>Okay, sure, bye.</i>

47:05.198 --> 47:07.632
Oh. Can I have a smoke?

47:17.143 --> 47:19.543
So why "Endgame"?

47:21.314 --> 47:23.915
It's a very important piece
for an audience to experience.

47:23.917 --> 47:26.050
Experience what?
Nothing happens.

47:27.954 --> 47:29.687
Why does anything
have to happen?

47:32.358 --> 47:34.926
Because...

47:34.928 --> 47:37.962
because a story is suppose
to have some kind of plot,

47:39.432 --> 47:43.134
and then some kind of
resolution... I don't know,

47:44.437 --> 47:46.170
basically something happens
that gives people hope,

47:46.172 --> 47:47.705
and not just tells them
we live for nothing.

47:47.707 --> 47:49.040
Beckett sucks.

47:53.446 --> 47:55.446
It may help you to know that uh,

47:57.016 --> 47:58.516
Beckett thinks that there is
nothing more funny

47:58.518 --> 48:00.418
than unhappiness.

48:04.324 --> 48:06.324
Yeah, of course he does.

48:26.245 --> 48:27.478
Okay, we're back!

48:27.480 --> 48:29.213
Call the actors.

48:29.215 --> 48:30.681
Let's go.
Let's get started.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.126
Okay.

48:42.128 --> 48:44.695
Jasna, uh...

48:44.697 --> 48:47.665
if you don't have any prior
arrangements tonight,

48:47.667 --> 48:50.468
could you possible stay
a little later today

48:50.470 --> 48:53.337
- and just clean up a bit.
- Of course.

48:53.339 --> 48:56.040
Only if I'm not
inconveniencing you.

48:56.042 --> 48:58.242
I've just that I've been
noticing a lot of dust around.

48:58.244 --> 49:00.444
And I don't have time to
maintain the washroom so.

49:00.446 --> 49:02.513
Oh no worries, I'll take care
of everything.

49:02.515 --> 49:04.415
Great. Thank you.

49:04.417 --> 49:06.717
Linda, I'm so sorry,
do you have a minute?

49:06.719 --> 49:08.552
Well, um... I gotta get
to the doctors office so.

49:08.554 --> 49:10.688
Oh, I-I hate to ask, but um,

49:10.690 --> 49:13.090
can I get a little advance now?

49:13.092 --> 49:15.459
It will help me greatly with
some bills that I have to pay.

49:15.461 --> 49:17.161
Well, I'm in a rush right now.

49:17.163 --> 49:19.030
So we'll talk about it later,
okay?

49:19.032 --> 49:21.766
Sure. Okay.
Can I remind you this Friday?

49:21.768 --> 49:23.768
- About this.
- Sure. Friday is good.

49:23.770 --> 49:26.070
Good, great.

49:29.609 --> 49:31.709
Th-thanks.

50:24.764 --> 50:27.465
- Just say it.
- Say what?

50:27.467 --> 50:29.700
My mom's crazy.

50:29.702 --> 50:31.368
Naw, your mom's lit.

50:31.370 --> 50:33.204
Shandra had it coming.

50:36.275 --> 50:38.876
Hey look, I know a place
where we can go hang out.

51:24.290 --> 51:26.524
Come on, Arman. Are you
actually cool with failing?

51:28.561 --> 51:30.528
Since when do you care
so much anyway?

51:30.530 --> 51:32.496
I thought you had
your escape plan.

51:46.179 --> 51:47.778
What you got there?

51:47.780 --> 51:49.680
Mrs. Fraser has chained me
to a theatre.

51:49.682 --> 51:51.615
How is that goin' for you?

51:51.617 --> 51:53.450
It's okay.

51:53.452 --> 51:56.620
If you like watching grown
adults play like children.

51:56.622 --> 51:58.722
Dealing with this arrogant
director

51:58.724 --> 52:01.258
who thinks he knows everything.

52:01.260 --> 52:03.360
There is nothing more
funny than unhappiness.

52:04.764 --> 52:06.830
Shit, that sounds horrible.

52:09.936 --> 52:11.535
Your turn.

52:24.650 --> 52:26.417
You wanna be a mechanic
like your dad?

52:28.387 --> 52:31.989
You think you're the only one
planning on ditchin' this wasteland.

52:31.991 --> 52:34.558
I'd be down just takin' the car
and bookin' it too, you know?

52:34.560 --> 52:36.594
Booking it where?

52:36.596 --> 52:38.762
My bro's got this really great
gig up north.

52:40.299 --> 52:41.899
I mean, who cares if he
didn't finish high school?

52:43.302 --> 52:44.702
It pays a shit ton!

52:46.505 --> 52:48.405
How do you think
we really getting by?

52:49.609 --> 52:51.775
By sellin' stolen phones?

52:53.012 --> 52:54.678
Hell no, I'm done
with that shit.

52:56.349 --> 52:57.715
So when is the trip?

52:58.918 --> 53:01.719
I dunno. It depends.

53:17.036 --> 53:19.870
You want me to go up there?

53:19.872 --> 53:22.640
With the polar bears
and the oil rigs?

53:22.642 --> 53:24.608
Yo, it's just a drawing.

53:24.610 --> 53:26.844
Mrs. Fray,
told us to visualize.

53:36.322 --> 53:37.755
Sorry.

53:39.025 --> 53:41.492
- For what?
- It's complicated.

53:42.728 --> 53:45.362
Just chill out will you?

54:07.353 --> 54:10.788
Not bad. You can also do
the windows.

54:10.790 --> 54:13.657
Mark the windows because the
lighting is coming in later

54:13.659 --> 54:15.559
and we can give them
some reference.

54:15.561 --> 54:17.061
Anything else?

54:17.063 --> 54:19.096
Yes, you will be also be
doing props.

54:19.098 --> 54:22.766
<i>Stanley is gonna show you
The inventory backstage.</i>

54:22.768 --> 54:25.669
- Aren't you, Stanley?
- Oh yeah, of course, why?

54:25.671 --> 54:27.938
<i>Okay.</i>

54:31.444 --> 54:32.943
Where is my pie?

54:34.714 --> 54:36.814
Wow, nice tape job, shadow.

54:38.117 --> 54:41.018
Or should I say, our new SM?

54:42.121 --> 54:44.388
Um, what's SM?

54:47.093 --> 54:48.692
Props are back here.

54:51.597 --> 54:53.564
See, Larry is the Stage Manager,

54:53.566 --> 54:55.065
but he barley shows up.

54:55.067 --> 54:56.800
And God know Greg is lost
with out him.

54:56.802 --> 54:59.403
So that's why it's really
awesome that you're here.

54:59.405 --> 55:01.672
- Greg doesn't like me.
- Yes he does.

55:01.674 --> 55:03.674
He thinks you have an
interesting point of view.

55:03.676 --> 55:05.743
- I told him Beckett sucks.
- Yeah. Exactly.

55:05.745 --> 55:07.611
This, I thinks it's broken.

55:07.613 --> 55:09.580
So you'll have to try
to find a way to fix that.

55:09.582 --> 55:12.649
Also relax. None of this
matters, okay?

55:12.651 --> 55:14.752
You're one of us now. Yeah.

55:14.754 --> 55:18.455
Your improv skills could use
a little work but...

55:18.457 --> 55:19.923
yeah, you got style.

55:21.127 --> 55:22.860
Yeah, I think that's it.
I don't know.

55:26.832 --> 55:28.832
Okay listen,
we're gonna run through

55:28.834 --> 55:30.701
all the Clov and Hamm scenes,
particularly for Mitch

55:30.703 --> 55:32.636
because he needs more work
than anyone else.

57:11.458 --> 57:13.458
Are you here?

57:26.792 --> 57:28.792
You've arrived?

57:31.083 --> 57:32.583
Let's go for a walk.

57:33.583 --> 57:35.000
You stopped taking your pills.

57:35.375 --> 57:38.708
- I don't need that artificial,
chemical-based medication.

57:38.958 --> 57:40.375
You're not healthy.

57:40.625 --> 57:42.042
Don't you understand that?

57:42.083 --> 57:43.625
What are you talking about?

57:43.667 --> 57:52.750
I feel alive! I'm taking my life back
and making something for the both of us.

57:52.792 --> 57:56.750
So that one day you won't have
to work for a Linda equivalent!

57:56.916 --> 57:59.049
You're fuckin' crazy!

57:59.051 --> 58:01.118
You need to be on medication!

58:04.056 --> 58:05.593
Shame on you!

58:05.671 --> 58:08.208
Stop acting like a spoiled brat.

58:09.161 --> 58:11.028
You should be ashamed of yourself.

58:11.030 --> 58:13.730
Did you hear me? Open the door.

58:16.292 --> 58:17.958
You know where that attitude
is going to get you?

58:18.000 --> 58:18.542
Nowhere!

58:19.625 --> 58:23.625
Open the door, do you hear me?

58:25.625 --> 58:27.728
Nina, open the fucking door

58:27.806 --> 58:30.681
or I'll break it down myself.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.958
I'm coming next week.

1:00:46.251 --> 1:00:48.752
Linda.
I was wondering if now

1:00:48.754 --> 1:00:51.088
- is a good time for us to talk...
- Actually Jasna,

1:00:51.090 --> 1:00:52.422
I have a question for you first

1:00:52.424 --> 1:00:54.157
and then you can ask me
anything you like.

1:00:54.159 --> 1:00:55.992
Okay.

1:00:55.994 --> 1:00:59.262
Why do I have an old sink in
a box in the storage room?

1:00:59.264 --> 1:01:01.465
Oh. The customer returned it
today.

1:01:01.467 --> 1:01:04.301
It looked like a manufacturing
mistake.

1:01:04.303 --> 1:01:06.770
- Manufacturing mistake?
- Yeah.

1:01:06.772 --> 1:01:08.205
See, I just-I just don't
understand

1:01:08.207 --> 1:01:11.007
how you can be the judge of
something like that.

1:01:11.009 --> 1:01:13.343
Well, it was kind of obvious.

1:01:13.345 --> 1:01:15.178
- Obvious?
- Mhmm.

1:01:15.180 --> 1:01:17.380
Okay. Well, the stores no
return policy

1:01:17.382 --> 1:01:19.950
is also very obvious.

1:01:21.353 --> 1:01:25.122
Jasna, I promised that I would
help you.

1:01:25.124 --> 1:01:26.923
The social worker
was very frank,

1:01:26.925 --> 1:01:29.126
he said you were going
through a tough time

1:01:29.128 --> 1:01:31.194
and I will help you,

1:01:31.196 --> 1:01:33.530
but only if you can adhere
to store policy.

1:01:33.532 --> 1:01:35.532
But that's ridiculous!

1:01:35.534 --> 1:01:37.834
The thing was actually broken.

1:01:37.836 --> 1:01:39.503
And I don't think
it's really fair.

1:01:39.505 --> 1:01:41.505
- Fair?
- Yeah.

1:01:41.507 --> 1:01:44.074
Okay. Jas...

1:01:44.076 --> 1:01:46.510
How do you think that I got
where I am today?

1:01:46.512 --> 1:01:49.212
I worked hard for many years
to build this business

1:01:49.214 --> 1:01:51.281
and I know that you don't
think that I deserve it,

1:01:51.283 --> 1:01:54.351
but I just-I don't understand
why you would feel that way.

1:01:54.353 --> 1:01:57.454
Because I do deserve it,
and it is fair.

1:01:59.458 --> 1:02:02.025
Okay. I'm s...

1:02:03.128 --> 1:02:04.394
I guess...

1:02:04.396 --> 1:02:06.863
the question I have for you
is this:

1:02:09.468 --> 1:02:12.269
why is it so hard for you
to respect me?

1:02:24.550 --> 1:02:26.316
Jasna.

1:02:26.318 --> 1:02:28.185
Didn't you have something
to ask me?

1:02:28.187 --> 1:02:29.820
I can't fuck around with you anymore.

1:02:30.125 --> 1:02:30.750
I can't.

1:02:30.824 --> 1:02:32.581
Okay. But I don't

1:02:32.583 --> 1:02:34.261
Not a chance.

1:02:34.331 --> 1:02:36.171
- Leave me alone, woman.
- <i>Okay. That's...</i>

1:02:36.233 --> 1:02:37.510
Stop pestering me already.

1:02:53.545 --> 1:02:55.412
Are we starting now or not?

1:02:56.615 --> 1:02:58.915
<i>all right brake is over.</i>

1:03:01.153 --> 1:03:03.920
Why don't we do a full run,
huh?

1:03:03.922 --> 1:03:06.122
- It's time. How are you feeling?
- All right.

1:03:06.124 --> 1:03:09.125
And Nina, make sure you have
your prop copy as a guide.

1:03:09.127 --> 1:03:10.961
this is just the start.

1:03:10.963 --> 1:03:12.495
We're starting tech tomorrow.

1:03:12.497 --> 1:03:14.464
Does that mean the lighting
guy is coming tomorrow?

1:03:14.466 --> 1:03:16.433
I will teach you
the lighting board.

1:03:16.435 --> 1:03:18.301
It's a good skill for you
to have in any case.

1:03:19.872 --> 1:03:22.973
<i>Okay. Everyone places.</i>

1:03:22.975 --> 1:03:25.242
<i>House lights are fading...</i>

1:03:25.244 --> 1:03:27.377
<i>and lights are coming up.</i>

1:03:36.054 --> 1:03:38.455
Did I hear you say gray?

1:03:38.457 --> 1:03:40.457
Light black from pole to pole.

1:03:40.459 --> 1:03:42.225
You exaggerate.

1:03:44.429 --> 1:03:47.264
Don't stay there.
You give me the shivers.

1:03:51.570 --> 1:03:54.070
Why this farce,
day after day?

1:03:55.207 --> 1:03:56.606
Routine.

1:03:56.608 --> 1:03:59.042
One never knows.

1:04:02.981 --> 1:04:06.650
Last night I saw inside
my breast.

1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:10.220
<i>There was a big sore.</i>

1:04:10.222 --> 1:04:11.554
<i>Pah!</i>

1:04:11.556 --> 1:04:13.323
<i>You saw your heart.</i>

1:04:13.325 --> 1:04:15.292
Stanley is really good
at that improve thing.

1:04:15.294 --> 1:04:16.693
You should let him show you.

1:04:16.695 --> 1:04:19.095
- <i>Clov...</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

1:04:19.097 --> 1:04:20.463
I think you're taking this
"shadow" thing

1:04:20.465 --> 1:04:22.999
a little too seriously.

1:04:23.001 --> 1:04:25.101
<i>What's happening?</i>

1:04:25.103 --> 1:04:28.538
<i>Something is taking
its course.</i>

1:04:28.540 --> 1:04:30.407
- Clov!
- What is it?

1:04:31.543 --> 1:04:33.209
<i>We're no beginning to...</i>

1:04:34.613 --> 1:04:36.046
<i>to...</i>

1:04:37.215 --> 1:04:38.715
<i>mean something?</i>

1:04:38.717 --> 1:04:40.283
Stop!

1:04:42.621 --> 1:04:44.721
I like to try something new.

1:04:46.725 --> 1:04:50.260
Why don't we pretend Clov
actually has a choice.

1:04:50.262 --> 1:04:51.962
If you want to leave, leave,

1:04:51.964 --> 1:04:53.596
if you want to get closer,
more intimate,

1:04:53.598 --> 1:04:55.398
you can do that.

1:04:55.400 --> 1:04:57.600
Forget about the blocking
we had before,

1:04:57.602 --> 1:04:59.469
and move freely in this part.

1:04:59.471 --> 1:05:01.338
Okay.

1:05:01.340 --> 1:05:03.373
Let's take it again

1:05:03.375 --> 1:05:06.576
from "why this farce day
after day".

1:05:26.531 --> 1:05:29.632
Why this farce,
day after day?

1:05:29.634 --> 1:05:31.768
<i>Routine.</i>

1:05:31.770 --> 1:05:34.537
<i>One never knows.</i>

1:05:34.539 --> 1:05:39.009
<i>Last night I saw inside
my breast.</i>

1:05:39.011 --> 1:05:42.345
<i>There was a big... sore.</i>

1:07:05.597 --> 1:07:07.464
Hey, honey, how was your work experience?

1:07:07.583 --> 1:07:08.292
- Great.

1:07:10.542 --> 1:07:12.708
You want to order Chinese?

1:07:29.708 --> 1:07:32.917
Great! Call me when you get here.

1:07:46.705 --> 1:07:50.440
<i>Well, think of someone
who has left everything behind,</i>

1:07:50.442 --> 1:07:53.510
possibly to feel at home again?
No.

1:08:02.287 --> 1:08:05.321
<i>What did you say?
No, of course not.</i>

1:08:05.323 --> 1:08:06.856
<i>You think that
it's just that easy</i>

1:08:06.858 --> 1:08:09.392
<i>to start everything
from scratch?</i>

1:08:09.394 --> 1:08:11.694
<i>That's why we need this</i>

1:08:11.696 --> 1:08:13.596
<i>It's-it's to...</i>

1:08:14.666 --> 1:08:16.399
<i>Ah?</i>

1:08:16.401 --> 1:08:17.767
Exactly. Thank you.

1:08:19.604 --> 1:08:21.671
Oh. It's to make transition...

1:08:22.908 --> 1:08:24.941
and besides all...

1:08:24.943 --> 1:08:26.676
the beautiful gardens,

1:08:26.678 --> 1:08:28.778
and a little spa,

1:08:28.780 --> 1:08:31.714
and a Language centre
there is one,

1:08:31.716 --> 1:08:34.551
there's one special place

1:08:34.553 --> 1:08:37.187
worth mentioning. Yes.

1:08:37.189 --> 1:08:39.622
It's inspired by my daughter.

1:08:39.624 --> 1:08:41.658
Oh! Oh, you have a daughter,
too.

1:08:41.660 --> 1:08:43.259
Wonderful.

1:08:43.261 --> 1:08:44.527
<i>Jasna.</i>

1:08:44.529 --> 1:08:47.263
Yes. Well, then you
understand...

1:08:48.567 --> 1:08:50.333
how important this is.

1:08:51.636 --> 1:08:52.969
Jasna.

1:08:52.971 --> 1:08:55.672
Oh, a must. Absolutely.

1:08:57.442 --> 1:08:59.209
- Well, it's...
- Jasna!

1:09:00.245 --> 1:09:02.345
To, to defend...

1:09:02.347 --> 1:09:04.280
JASNA!

1:09:10.432 --> 1:09:12.132
It's late, shouldn't you be sleeping?

1:10:16.454 --> 1:10:17.954
- Hello.
- Oh. Hi.

1:10:17.956 --> 1:10:19.389
Hi. How may I help you today?

1:10:19.391 --> 1:10:21.291
Is Benjamin MacKay here?

1:10:21.293 --> 1:10:22.825
- Yes, of course.
- Oh, great.

1:10:22.827 --> 1:10:24.827
Um, did you have an
appointment?

1:10:24.829 --> 1:10:26.663
Oh, no. Um...

1:10:26.665 --> 1:10:28.831
I just spoke to him directly,

1:10:28.833 --> 1:10:31.601
and we're making plans
to see each other.

1:10:31.603 --> 1:10:33.970
He told me to stop by
when I'm ready so.

1:10:33.972 --> 1:10:35.672
Oh, I see. Um...

1:10:37.542 --> 1:10:40.009
unfortunately Mr. Mackay
is super busy today,

1:10:40.011 --> 1:10:42.779
and I don't actually think
he has time to see you.

1:10:44.482 --> 1:10:47.317
<i>Perhaps we can try to
reschedule something?</i>

1:10:47.319 --> 1:10:49.686
Oh um... you know what?

1:10:49.688 --> 1:10:52.021
I'll-I'll just wait here.

1:10:52.023 --> 1:10:53.690
I'll wait for him
until he's done.

1:10:53.692 --> 1:10:54.857
- Oh, you sure?
- That-that's totally fine.

1:10:54.859 --> 1:10:56.926
- Yeah. Thanks.
- All right.

1:11:10.842 --> 1:11:12.842
Wow, it is happening.

1:11:12.844 --> 1:11:15.078
We'll get revised drawings
to your team next week,

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:17.347
- with new footprint. Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:11:17.349 --> 1:11:18.414
Okay? Thank you, Howard.

1:11:18.416 --> 1:11:20.616
Hi Ben.

1:11:20.618 --> 1:11:22.352
- Uh, give me a moment.
- Sure.

1:11:22.354 --> 1:11:23.820
Thanks.

1:11:23.822 --> 1:11:27.056
<i>Yeah, just um, thanks
for coming Howard, okay?</i>

1:11:27.058 --> 1:11:28.991
<i>Sure.</i>

1:11:28.993 --> 1:11:30.927
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:11:30.929 --> 1:11:32.929
Remember that night
when we were talking...

1:11:32.931 --> 1:11:34.797
Let's-let's go to
the conference room.

1:11:34.799 --> 1:11:36.799
Sarah, when the contractors
come can you ask them

1:11:36.801 --> 1:11:39.535
- to wait a few minutes?
- All right.

1:11:39.537 --> 1:11:41.537
Thank you.
Jasna, it's this way.

1:11:41.539 --> 1:11:44.374
- Um, oh, I-I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. I got this.

1:11:44.376 --> 1:11:46.376
- Thank you.
- It's just through here.

1:11:46.378 --> 1:11:48.644
- Should I bring my bag?
- No, it'll be fine right here.

1:11:48.646 --> 1:11:49.846
It'll be safe.
Keep an eye on things.

1:11:49.848 --> 1:11:51.848
Just-just...

1:11:51.850 --> 1:11:53.649
Remember that night when
we were talking about

1:11:53.651 --> 1:11:55.718
and you said
it's gonna be easy.

1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:58.421
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah? Well, uh, here it is!

1:11:58.423 --> 1:12:01.491
- This is that Easy Land.
- Yeah, um...

1:12:01.493 --> 1:12:02.959
you've been working.

1:12:02.961 --> 1:12:05.061
- Oh I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

1:12:05.063 --> 1:12:07.430
Yeah, it's just now
falling apart.

1:12:07.432 --> 1:12:09.699
All right well... why don't
you have a seat and uh,

1:12:09.701 --> 1:12:12.468
- Sure.
- can I get you a glass of water

1:12:12.470 --> 1:12:14.070
or anything?

1:12:14.072 --> 1:12:16.606
- Um, no.
- Okay.

1:12:16.608 --> 1:12:18.408
- All right.
- No.

1:12:18.410 --> 1:12:20.009
Maybe it's a little too big.

1:12:20.011 --> 1:12:21.611
I mean, it can be downsized.

1:12:21.613 --> 1:12:23.446
No. No, it's uh...
you've been working.

1:12:23.448 --> 1:12:25.047
Yeah.

1:12:25.049 --> 1:12:27.049
Ma-ma-ma.

1:12:27.051 --> 1:12:28.885
La-la-la-la.

1:12:32.490 --> 1:12:33.823
You're late.

1:12:33.825 --> 1:12:35.725
Sorry.

1:12:35.727 --> 1:12:37.727
Try to be on time
from now on.

1:12:37.729 --> 1:12:39.796
You know how much we still
have left to do.

1:12:39.798 --> 1:12:42.565
We have tech rehearsal, I still
gotta teach you so much.

1:12:42.567 --> 1:12:44.801
And then you have
to be very specific

1:12:44.803 --> 1:12:45.868
about how we plot the lighting

1:12:45.870 --> 1:12:47.437
because Beckett requires...

1:12:48.606 --> 1:12:50.106
It's been a couple of weeks
so...

1:12:54.612 --> 1:12:57.013
Oh. Of course.

1:12:59.217 --> 1:13:00.917
You deserve a mark.

1:13:04.222 --> 1:13:07.557
Does this mean that you won't
be here for the run?

1:13:09.527 --> 1:13:11.761
Well, I'm leaving the country
soon.

1:13:11.763 --> 1:13:13.129
Larry is gonna be here, right?

1:13:22.507 --> 1:13:24.707
<i>We all have to make our own
choices, Nina.</i>

1:13:25.810 --> 1:13:27.777
I just hope that whatever
you choose to do

1:13:27.779 --> 1:13:29.846
in the future fulfills you.

1:13:29.848 --> 1:13:31.681
Thanks, Greg.

1:13:32.817 --> 1:13:33.950
<i>Okay, we're back.</i>

1:13:35.086 --> 1:13:37.820
<i>From the top.</i>

1:13:55.940 --> 1:13:58.107
Jasna.

1:13:58.109 --> 1:13:59.775
Turn around.

1:14:06.083 --> 1:14:07.542
What happened?

1:14:09.792 --> 1:14:11.250
Where is Easyland?

1:14:11.833 --> 1:14:13.708
I presented it to Ben.

1:14:14.833 --> 1:14:17.667
I'm a little tired. Come sit
down.

1:14:20.708 --> 1:14:21.667
What did he say?

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:25.750
He really liked it.

1:14:25.792 --> 1:14:28.792
He wanted to take a look at the model
in detail so I left it with him.

1:14:29.208 --> 1:14:30.333
- Really?

1:14:30.625 --> 1:14:31.625
Are you okay?

1:14:37.750 --> 1:14:38.958
Come on, it'll get cold.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.542
You know what this means?

1:14:40.583 --> 1:14:42.167
- Eat, it'll get cold.

1:14:43.542 --> 1:14:45.125
- Take off your jacket.

1:14:56.833 --> 1:14:58.250
Your dream came true!

1:14:59.292 --> 1:15:02.875
You're going to be a successful architect.
And I'm going to finish school.

1:15:05.375 --> 1:15:07.125
It was a great idea.

1:15:14.833 --> 1:15:17.000
You wouldn't be making something
like this up?

1:15:20.125 --> 1:15:21.792
Of course I wouldn't.

1:16:56.154 --> 1:16:57.687
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1:17:01.726 --> 1:17:04.126
She left it for me
to give you.

1:17:07.031 --> 1:17:08.698
Bye.

1:17:31.055 --> 1:17:32.822
Have you seen Arman?

1:17:35.059 --> 1:17:36.992
Have you guys seen Arman?

1:17:50.341 --> 1:17:51.907
<i>Hello.</i>

1:17:51.909 --> 1:17:54.043
Hi. It's Arman's friend.
Is he home?

1:17:54.045 --> 1:17:55.778
No.

1:18:10.128 --> 1:18:11.794
Is Arman here?

1:18:11.796 --> 1:18:13.095
My mom already told you.
No.

1:18:15.900 --> 1:18:17.500
- What the hell?
- Sorry, it's just...

1:18:17.502 --> 1:18:19.435
aren't you supposed to be
up North?

1:18:19.437 --> 1:18:21.303
That shit got wrecked.

1:18:21.305 --> 1:18:23.405
There is no more work
in the oil fields.

1:18:23.407 --> 1:18:25.407
Don't you watch the news, girl?

1:18:45.530 --> 1:18:47.096
Hey...

1:18:48.533 --> 1:18:50.132
what you doing here?

1:18:53.337 --> 1:18:55.337
What happened to Serbia?

1:18:55.339 --> 1:18:57.139
That shit got wrecked?

1:19:02.213 --> 1:19:03.946
Do you wanna go to our
hangout spot?

1:19:06.551 --> 1:19:09.385
It's freezing out here.
Okay. Com' on.

1:19:09.387 --> 1:19:11.520
- Can you keep quiet?
- Yeah.

1:19:12.990 --> 1:19:14.290
Com' on.

1:19:29.307 --> 1:19:32.102
Arman, are you gonna watch the game?

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.500
I'm tired man, had a long
workout.

1:19:58.436 --> 1:20:01.203
So you're here for good, yeah?

1:20:08.546 --> 1:20:10.212
Yeah.

1:22:00.591 --> 1:22:02.324
Shh. Shh.

1:22:21.312 --> 1:22:23.112
I have to go.

1:22:23.114 --> 1:22:24.713
My mom is gonna worry.

1:22:39.430 --> 1:22:41.330
So I'll see you soon then.

1:22:42.700 --> 1:22:44.700
Yeah.

1:23:15.332 --> 1:23:16.698
Mama!

1:23:20.371 --> 1:23:21.837
Mama!

1:23:37.655 --> 1:23:40.255
<i>911 what's your
emergency!</i>

1:23:40.257 --> 1:23:42.124
I think my mom took
too many pills.

1:23:43.661 --> 1:23:45.461
Mama! Mama!

1:23:47.631 --> 1:23:49.865
We'll make a new Easyland.

1:23:50.500 --> 1:23:53.125
We'll make it together... It'll
be...

1:23:54.125 --> 1:23:55.625
We'll make... We'll make a new one.

1:23:56.250 --> 1:23:57.750
I'll help you... It was a great
idea...

1:23:58.167 --> 1:24:00.750
I really liked the idea. It was
a great idea.

1:24:01.250 --> 1:24:02.750
I'll make it with you.

1:24:03.667 --> 1:24:05.167
We'll start from the
beginning...

1:24:05.792 --> 1:24:08.125
We'll start over again from the
beginning.

1:24:09.500 --> 1:24:10.875
We'll make a new model and

1:24:10.917 --> 1:24:13.042
I'll put on the little bushes
like you wanted.

1:24:15.693 --> 1:24:17.459
Mama!

1:24:18.042 --> 1:24:20.208
Mom, we'll start again from the
beginning.

1:24:20.750 --> 1:24:22.500
I'm going to help you this time.

1:24:25.469 --> 1:24:27.402
Mama...

1:26:40.804 --> 1:26:43.305
Damn the sun.

1:26:43.307 --> 1:26:44.906
Is it night already then?

1:26:44.908 --> 1:26:46.775
No.

1:26:46.777 --> 1:26:49.845
- Then what is it?
- Gray.

1:26:51.482 --> 1:26:52.714
Gray.

1:26:53.984 --> 1:26:55.884
Gray!

1:26:59.890 --> 1:27:02.424
Gray.

1:27:02.426 --> 1:27:04.393
Gray!

1:27:04.395 --> 1:27:06.328
Did I hear you say gray?

1:27:06.330 --> 1:27:07.729
Light black.

1:27:07.731 --> 1:27:09.431
From pole to pole.

1:27:09.433 --> 1:27:10.866
You exaggerate.

1:27:12.903 --> 1:27:15.370
Don't stay there,
you give me the shivers.

1:27:24.081 --> 1:27:26.648
Why this farce, day after day?

1:27:27.918 --> 1:27:31.053
Routine. One never knows.

1:27:34.425 --> 1:27:37.793
Last night I saw into my breast.

1:27:39.863 --> 1:27:41.830
There was a big sore.

1:27:41.832 --> 1:27:44.399
Pah! You saw your heart.

1:27:45.669 --> 1:27:48.637
No, it was living.

1:27:48.639 --> 1:27:50.706
I wonder.

1:27:53.744 --> 1:27:56.478
If a rational being came
back to earth,

1:27:56.480 --> 1:27:58.980
wouldn't he begin to have
ideas in his head

1:27:58.982 --> 1:28:00.949
if he observed us long enough.

1:28:02.453 --> 1:28:04.052
Ah, yes,

1:28:04.054 --> 1:28:06.588
now I see it.

1:28:06.590 --> 1:28:09.858
Ah... yes, now I understand
what they're at!

1:28:17.501 --> 1:28:19.901
And without going so far
as that,

1:28:21.538 --> 1:28:22.804
we ourselves...

1:28:23.841 --> 1:28:25.807
we ourselves...

1:28:26.844 --> 1:28:29.044
at certain moments.

1:28:30.581 --> 1:28:31.847
To think perhaps...

1:28:32.950 --> 1:28:35.884
this wasn't all for nothing!
