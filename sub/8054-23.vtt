The place the Pawnee general
has called

00:14.704 --> 00:17.539
The sexiest,
most dangerous club in town.

00:17.607 --> 00:19.574
- That's not what they wrote.
- Fine.

00:19.642 --> 00:20.942
I added the word "sexiest,"

00:21.010 --> 00:22.454
But we've hired
better security.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.314
Yes, I am a good friend
for throwing the party.

00:25.382 --> 00:27.912
I'm also a genius because
I'm using the occasion

00:27.979 --> 00:30.649
To stock the club with
every available hottie I know.

00:30.717 --> 00:32.414
Call me a romantic,

00:32.482 --> 00:33.848
But I believe by
the end of the night,

00:33.915 --> 00:36.913
I will have between
one and four new girlfriends.

00:36.981 --> 00:38.114
Oh, that's great.

00:38.182 --> 00:39.681
I'd love to hear
all about your family vacations.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.081
- Hey.
- Oh, thank God.

00:41.149 --> 00:42.716
Get out, Kyle.

00:42.784 --> 00:46.416
Hello, birthday girl.

00:46.484 --> 00:47.720
Got you a birthday present.

00:47.788 --> 00:48.890
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:48.958 --> 00:51.027
I, uh, I wrote you a song.

00:51.095 --> 00:52.798
Score. What's it called?

00:52.865 --> 00:54.036
I'm not telling,
but I'll give you a clue.

00:54.104 --> 00:56.005
It's named after
a month out of the year.

00:56.073 --> 00:57.173
So April?

00:57.241 --> 01:00.147
No.

01:00.214 --> 01:01.382
That would have been
way better.

01:01.450 --> 01:03.317
Um...
Well, whatever.

01:03.385 --> 01:04.684
I can rewrite the lyrics.

01:04.751 --> 01:06.720
Um, are you coming to my party?

01:06.788 --> 01:08.521
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

01:08.589 --> 01:09.656
Are you kidding me?

01:09.724 --> 01:11.259
- Okay, cool.
- Okay.

01:11.327 --> 01:13.394
Um, well, we'll hang out then.

01:13.462 --> 01:14.428
Okay.

01:14.496 --> 01:15.929
It's gonna be fun.

01:15.997 --> 01:18.898
Yes, I am 21 years old today.

01:18.966 --> 01:21.600
Which is the age
that pretty much everyone agrees

01:21.668 --> 01:24.736
Makes you an adult.

01:27.773 --> 01:29.373
♪ ♪

01:44.865 --> 01:47.668
The yearly budget
and planning proposal for a city

01:47.736 --> 01:50.972
<i>Is called the master plan.</i>

01:51.040 --> 01:52.841
Isn't that just so awesome
you can't stand it?

01:52.908 --> 01:57.181
Oh, I shall now reveal to you

01:58.783 --> 02:00.317
Ee-ah-ah-ah-ah...

02:01.620 --> 02:03.154
Kind of sounded like
a chimp there at the end.

02:03.222 --> 02:05.356
Good morning, everybody.

02:05.424 --> 02:07.926
I know you all have
your budget presentations ready,

02:07.993 --> 02:09.426
But there's a change of plans.

02:09.495 --> 02:11.996
Due to the crippling gridlock
in city counsel,

02:12.064 --> 02:13.231
We are postponing

02:13.299 --> 02:15.601
All planning and spending
decisions indefinitely.

02:15.668 --> 02:17.502
Um, until when?

02:17.570 --> 02:18.704
Indefinitely.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.640
- And when will that end?
- Later than now.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.575
So this week probably?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.312
- Look, we are bordering on
a full-blown crisis, Leslie.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.748
The state government
is sending a team

02:27.816 --> 02:29.950
From Indianapolis
to try to solve

02:30.018 --> 02:31.285
This budget problem.

02:31.353 --> 02:32.853
Just calm down.

02:32.921 --> 02:34.622
You don't even know
what they're gonna do.

02:34.690 --> 02:36.124
Ron, they're state auditors.

02:36.191 --> 02:37.559
They're here to slash and burn.

02:37.626 --> 02:39.161
We gotta fight these guys.

02:39.229 --> 02:40.729
They've been sent by
the governor.

02:40.797 --> 02:42.498
They outrank everyone.

02:42.565 --> 02:44.300
There's no fight
to be had here.

02:44.367 --> 02:46.068
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not gonna fight them.

02:46.136 --> 02:47.503
Except that I am!

02:47.571 --> 02:49.439
Okay.

02:49.507 --> 02:50.740
Leslie.

02:50.808 --> 02:54.143
What do we do
when we get this angry?

02:54.211 --> 02:55.945
We count backwards
from 1,000 by sevens

02:56.012 --> 02:57.279
And we think of warm brownies.

02:57.347 --> 02:59.448
Go do that in your office.

02:59.516 --> 03:00.717
Go do it in your office.

03:00.784 --> 03:02.518
And we'll wait for
these guys to show up.

03:02.586 --> 03:04.987
I'll wait for you to show up.

03:05.055 --> 03:06.722
Andy!

03:06.790 --> 03:08.658
You coming out tonight,
part owner of the club?

03:08.725 --> 03:10.192
Uh, yes.

03:10.260 --> 03:11.660
Let me ask you
a quick question.

03:11.728 --> 03:13.195
What's the youngest
a girl can be

03:13.263 --> 03:15.430
That if, uh, we go out,
I'm not a total scumbag?

03:15.498 --> 03:17.065
You know the old rule.

03:17.133 --> 03:18.533
Half your age, plus seven.

03:18.601 --> 03:21.803
Half my age plus seven.
Oh, okay.

03:21.871 --> 03:24.372
Well, I'm 29 so half of...

03:24.439 --> 03:27.876
29...Add seven,

03:27.944 --> 03:32.414
That's only 20...Is--

03:32.481 --> 03:35.050
- 21--
- 20 years old.

03:35.118 --> 03:36.218
- 21.
- And a half.

03:36.286 --> 03:37.353
21 years old and a half.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.687
- Yup.
- Yup.

03:38.755 --> 03:40.957
We got the same thing
with the equation on that one.

03:41.024 --> 03:42.291
Here's the thing.

03:42.359 --> 03:44.294
What if she's slightly younger?

03:44.361 --> 03:45.562
Can I go out with
someone younger than that?

03:45.629 --> 03:47.397
Please!
You totally can.

03:47.465 --> 03:48.732
Yeah.

03:48.799 --> 03:52.536
Tom says it's okay.

03:52.603 --> 03:55.105
That probably means
it isn't okay.

03:55.173 --> 03:58.876
Thank you for meeting
with me again.

03:58.944 --> 04:01.412
I don't even know really
what I wanna say.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.780
But I guess
I just don't get it.

04:02.848 --> 04:04.883
You know, our relationship
was so great.

04:04.950 --> 04:07.986
Mark, honestly,
it was really nice.

04:08.054 --> 04:11.022
But maybe you thought
it was so amazing

04:11.090 --> 04:13.558
Because you've never dated
someone for so long before.

04:13.626 --> 04:16.661
Well, but, for example,
we barely ever fought.

04:16.728 --> 04:18.563
That's not a good sign.

04:18.630 --> 04:21.199
You're supposed to fight.
Sometimes.

04:21.266 --> 04:24.902
You're...Supposed to miss
the other person

04:24.970 --> 04:27.504
Even if they're only gone
for 20 minutes.

04:27.572 --> 04:29.440
And I just didn't feel that.

04:29.507 --> 04:31.575
Did you?

04:31.643 --> 04:34.511
Man, I, uh...

04:34.579 --> 04:37.748
I should have yelled at you
way more.

04:37.816 --> 04:39.850
Well, Paul just called.

04:39.918 --> 04:41.752
They're on their way.

04:41.820 --> 04:42.986
Oh, God, they're gonna
fire people, aren't they?

04:43.054 --> 04:45.088
Yeah, I am two years
from my pension.

04:45.156 --> 04:46.356
Relax, Jerry.
We don't know that.

04:46.424 --> 04:49.025
Maybe these people
are very helpful and pleasant--

04:49.093 --> 04:51.294
- Hello.
- Ha! Death!

04:51.362 --> 04:54.296
- Divorce filings?
- Fourth floor.

04:54.364 --> 04:56.365
- Hello, hello?
- Oh.

04:56.433 --> 04:58.166
Hey. How are you?
Hello there.

04:58.234 --> 04:59.367
Hi.

04:59.435 --> 05:01.103
Chris Traeger.
This is Ben.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.204
Hello, gents.
Ron Swanson.

05:02.272 --> 05:06.408
Ron...Swanson.

05:06.476 --> 05:07.609
Okay.

05:07.677 --> 05:09.177
I'm deputy director,
Leslie Knope.

05:09.245 --> 05:12.681
Leslie...Knope.

05:12.749 --> 05:13.849
It is fantastic to be here.

05:13.916 --> 05:15.017
Would you gentlemen
like a tour?

05:15.084 --> 05:16.184
Oh, there is quite literally

05:16.252 --> 05:17.653
Nothing I would rather have
in the world

05:17.720 --> 05:19.788
Than a tour of the parks
and recreation department

05:19.856 --> 05:23.725
Of the great city of Pawnee
led by Ron Swanson.

05:23.793 --> 05:25.293
And Leslie Knope.

05:25.361 --> 05:26.928
- Okay.
- Ben?

05:26.996 --> 05:27.996
I don't think
that's a great idea.

05:28.064 --> 05:29.331
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

05:29.398 --> 05:31.166
Chris is the most positive
state budget

05:31.233 --> 05:32.901
Auditing consultant
I've ever met.

05:32.968 --> 05:35.436
I mean,
I made eye contact with him,

05:35.504 --> 05:37.438
And it was like...

05:37.506 --> 05:39.573
Staring into the sun.

05:39.641 --> 05:40.741
People.

05:40.809 --> 05:42.743
We are here from
the state budget office

05:42.811 --> 05:44.612
From Indianapolis.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.980
Ooh! What does that mean?

05:46.048 --> 05:49.317
Well, simply, we are here
to tinker with your budget.

05:49.384 --> 05:52.653
Think of the government
as a broken down carousel.

05:52.721 --> 05:54.655
We're gonna slap on
a new coat of paint,

05:54.723 --> 05:56.857
We're gonna fix that broken
speaker system,

05:56.925 --> 05:58.258
And we are gonna get
those happy kids

05:58.326 --> 06:00.894
Back up on the horses
where they belong!

06:00.962 --> 06:02.062
Okay?

06:02.130 --> 06:04.064
Yeah.

06:04.132 --> 06:05.332
Okay?

06:06.868 --> 06:08.235
There it is.

06:08.303 --> 06:10.004
My, uh, partner Ben is gonna
stick around for a little bit.

06:10.071 --> 06:12.906
And I will see you all later.

06:12.974 --> 06:14.508
Adios.

06:14.576 --> 06:16.577
Do you have a second?

06:21.316 --> 06:23.283
I really like your shirt.

06:23.351 --> 06:24.751
So I'd like to talk about

06:24.819 --> 06:27.086
Where you think there's waste
within your department.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.724
- There is none.
- Where do I start?

06:30.791 --> 06:33.526
What exactly
will you be cutting?

06:33.594 --> 06:34.927
And how much of it,

06:34.995 --> 06:38.196
And can I watch you doing it
while eating pork cracklins?

06:38.264 --> 06:40.365
Okay, let's start
with personnel.

06:40.433 --> 06:43.101
What can you tell me about
Jerry Gergich?

06:43.168 --> 06:45.737
He is one of the best people
on the planet.

06:45.804 --> 06:47.405
He's universally adored here.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.207
If you fired him,
there would be a revolt.

06:50.275 --> 06:51.576
Okay, you need to understand

06:51.644 --> 06:53.412
That just to keep this town
afloat,

06:53.480 --> 06:55.114
We probably have to cut
the budget

06:55.182 --> 06:58.351
Of every department
by 40% or 50%, okay?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.853
Well, but Chris said that
you just had to,

07:00.920 --> 07:02.789
You know, tinker with things.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.358
Yeah, he said that because
that sounds a lot better than,

07:05.426 --> 07:06.726
"we're going to gut it with
a machete."

07:06.794 --> 07:09.996
Okay?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.635
- You're a jerk.
- I'm sorry?

07:14.702 --> 07:15.969
Easy.

07:16.037 --> 07:17.504
I'm sorry, these are
real people in a real town

07:17.571 --> 07:19.439
Working in a real building
with real feelings.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.341
This building has feelings?

07:21.408 --> 07:22.676
Maybe.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.644
There's a lot of history
in this one, maybe it does.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.012
How can you be
so blase about it?

07:26.079 --> 07:27.713
Because I didn't cause
these problems, miss Knope.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.849
Your government did.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.484
I'll get what I need
from the spreadsheets.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.320
Thanks.

07:37.524 --> 07:38.958
- What's a not-gay way
to ask him

07:39.026 --> 07:41.061
To go camping with me?

07:43.788 --> 07:44.854
- John-Ralphio.
- Lookin' hot, big t.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.357

07:48.859 --> 07:50.359
Just kidding, I know.

07:50.427 --> 07:53.529
- Walk away.
- Yep, you got it.

07:53.596 --> 07:54.963
Got your birthday shot.

07:55.031 --> 07:56.465
Oh, thanks.

07:56.532 --> 07:59.101
But now that it's legal,
I've kind of lost interest.

07:59.168 --> 08:02.803
Suit yourself.

08:04.773 --> 08:07.541
I guess our awesome new park
is on hold.

08:07.609 --> 08:09.309
Do you have any idea
what they're gonna cut?

08:09.377 --> 08:10.744
No.

08:10.812 --> 08:13.147
I don't know, this has been
a really crappy day.

08:13.214 --> 08:14.381

when I called?

08:14.449 --> 08:15.882
Talking to mark.

08:15.950 --> 08:19.252
- Again?
- Yeah.

08:19.319 --> 08:21.420
- You wanna get super drunk?
- I really do.

So funny.
You are so funny.

- Oh.
- Let me see.

09:05.697 --> 09:06.797
- No.
- Do a twirl.

09:06.865 --> 09:07.865
- No.
- This is beautiful.

09:07.933 --> 09:09.834
No, don't look at me.

09:09.902 --> 09:12.170
No, look. Look at me.
Happy Birthday.

09:12.238 --> 09:13.338
Thank you.

09:13.406 --> 09:14.439
Uh, can I get you a drink?

09:14.507 --> 09:18.144
Or--wait.

09:18.212 --> 09:20.446
Yeah, I can swing it.
Can I get you a drink?

09:20.514 --> 09:22.482
Whiskey. Neat.

09:22.550 --> 09:24.484
Wow, you're not messing around.

09:24.552 --> 09:27.120
No. I'm not.

09:27.188 --> 09:31.391
♪ ♪

09:31.459 --> 09:32.659
Barkeep!

09:32.727 --> 09:35.662
Andy Dwyer.
It is so awesome to see you.

09:35.730 --> 09:37.330
Hey, you too, how are you?

09:37.398 --> 09:38.631
Let me ask you a question.

09:38.699 --> 09:40.666
Was I a good girlfriend?

09:40.734 --> 09:43.036
Ann, you were
an awesome girlfriend.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.771
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:44.839 --> 09:47.340
- Aw.
- Yeah.

09:47.408 --> 09:48.808
I mean, I was the screwup.

09:48.876 --> 09:49.976
Yeah, you were.

09:51.178 --> 09:52.579
We had a good relationship,
right?

09:52.647 --> 09:54.214
God, I think so.

09:54.282 --> 09:57.718
I mean, we fought a lot.
I know. I know.

09:57.786 --> 09:59.887
I know that.
Let me ask you something.

09:59.955 --> 10:01.689
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm hot.

10:01.756 --> 10:02.923
Is that a question?

10:02.991 --> 10:05.192
- Um, when we were together--
I can't see.

10:05.260 --> 10:06.493
Here.

10:06.561 --> 10:07.661
- When we were together--
- Yes.

10:07.729 --> 10:09.829
Were there times
that you were like,

10:09.897 --> 10:12.398
"if I don't see Ann
in, like, ten seconds,

10:12.466 --> 10:13.733
I'm gonna die"?

10:13.800 --> 10:16.101
Yes. All the time.

10:16.169 --> 10:17.569
I loved Andy.

10:17.637 --> 10:19.070
Loved him.

10:19.138 --> 10:20.705
<i>Loved Andy.</i>

10:20.772 --> 10:24.041
He was a totally helpless baby
when we met.

10:24.109 --> 10:25.909
I dated him for three years.

10:25.977 --> 10:29.379
Now he's an adult with a job.

10:29.447 --> 10:33.283
And some other girl
is gonna reap the rewards

10:33.350 --> 10:36.519
Of my hard work?

10:36.587 --> 10:38.588
That's bull[bleep].

10:42.860 --> 10:45.428
I'm reading this, and I'm like,

10:45.496 --> 10:48.197
How could they
hurt those gorillas like that?

10:48.265 --> 10:51.967
They're such gentle,
magnificent creatures, you know?

10:52.035 --> 10:53.769
I'm an animal lover,
I don't know.

10:53.836 --> 10:57.305
Hey, I, um, want you to keep
this bottlecap.

10:57.372 --> 10:59.106
So you'll always remember me

10:59.174 --> 11:01.909
And the first time we met.

11:01.977 --> 11:04.645
Classic game.
Plant the seed.

11:04.713 --> 11:06.080
Harvest like a half hour later.

11:06.147 --> 11:09.717
Here you go.
Sorry that took forever.

11:09.785 --> 11:11.920
God.

11:11.988 --> 11:14.890
Hey, baby, you miss me?
'cause I missed you.

11:14.957 --> 11:16.058
Oh, look at this.
John-Ralphio.

11:16.125 --> 11:17.692
Oh, hey. Andy.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.794
Andy.
That's an all right name.

11:18.861 --> 11:20.128
That's an all right name.

11:20.196 --> 11:22.398
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

11:22.465 --> 11:25.201
- Are you guys--are you guys
hanging out together?

11:25.269 --> 11:26.602
Yeah, uh, maybe.

11:26.670 --> 11:28.004
You know, he asked me out
so many times.

11:28.071 --> 11:29.338
I guess he wore me down.

11:29.406 --> 11:31.340
I'm very persistent.

11:31.407 --> 11:32.541
Come over here.
Come over here.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.142
- I can hear you. I can--
- Come over here.

11:34.210 --> 11:35.877
One time, I waited outside
a woman's house

11:35.945 --> 11:38.613
For five days just to show her
how serious I was

11:38.680 --> 11:39.947
About wanting to drill her.

11:40.015 --> 11:41.815
Turns out,
it was the wrong house.

11:41.883 --> 11:43.283
She loved the story anyway.

11:43.350 --> 11:44.817
We got to third base.
Over the pants.

11:44.885 --> 11:46.986
- That's so cute.
- Yeah, super cute.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.321
- Wow.
- Right?

11:48.389 --> 11:49.956
Do you want a Remy Martin?
Probably good.

11:50.024 --> 11:51.291
Okay, I'll get you one.

11:51.359 --> 11:54.361
Two Remy Martins.
Here we go.

11:56.464 --> 11:57.665
You can have my Remy Martin.

11:57.732 --> 12:01.669
For your birthday.

12:01.737 --> 12:03.238
I thought she liked me.

12:03.306 --> 12:06.308
I guess I'm super bad
at picking up signals.

12:08.311 --> 12:11.346
But that Ralph Macchio guy's
a total douche.

12:11.414 --> 12:14.650
Did I give you a bottlecap?

12:14.717 --> 12:16.852
Excuse me.
Did I give you a bottlecap?

12:16.920 --> 12:18.453
- What?
- Ugh!

12:18.521 --> 12:21.523
Did I give any of you guys
a bottlecap?

12:21.591 --> 12:24.392
You sure?

12:24.460 --> 12:26.027
Who the [bleep]
did I give a bottlecap to?

12:26.095 --> 12:27.996
♪ fast money, fast cars ♪

12:28.063 --> 12:30.398

12:34.203 --> 12:36.437
This party sucks.
Let's get out of here.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.506
- It's my birthday party.
- It is?

12:38.574 --> 12:41.142
- Yes.
- I'm sorry, boo.

12:41.210 --> 12:42.810
- You know what's thirsty?
- What?

12:42.878 --> 12:44.378
You know what's weird?

12:44.446 --> 12:45.780
How thirsty I get
when I'm weird.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.749
- Mm-hmm.
- When I'm drunk.

12:47.816 --> 12:50.018
Ben the jerk is here.

12:50.085 --> 12:51.620
- Who are?
- That one.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.722
The one coming over here.
Get ready.

12:53.790 --> 12:55.991
Okay, Leslie, be professional.

12:56.059 --> 12:57.193
Hi.

12:57.261 --> 12:59.596
Hello, Ben.

12:59.663 --> 13:02.332
Um, look, uh,

13:02.400 --> 13:05.068
I kind of feel like
we got off on the wrong foot. G

13:05.136 --> 13:07.704
So I just wanted to stop by
and--

13:07.772 --> 13:09.740
- Yeah, well, save your breath,
okay?

13:09.807 --> 13:12.375
Just get out of here.

13:12.442 --> 13:14.176
Because this is a party
with my friends

13:14.244 --> 13:15.678
And you're trying to fire
all my friends.

13:15.745 --> 13:17.045
- I--

13:17.113 --> 13:18.679
- Plus I just talked to
everybody in this bar

13:18.747 --> 13:20.214
And nobody wants you here.

13:20.282 --> 13:23.084
- Um, okay, then I'll--
I'll just see you tomorrow.

13:23.151 --> 13:25.018
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry to bother you.

13:25.086 --> 13:28.355
Get out of here.

13:28.423 --> 13:31.992
Leslie,
that was so professional.

13:32.059 --> 13:33.360
I'm so proud of you.

13:33.427 --> 13:34.761
Thank you.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.334
- You have to help me.
- Ow.

13:39.402 --> 13:42.604
I know, me too.
But you have to help me.

13:42.672 --> 13:44.673
I think I may have made out
with someone last night.

13:44.741 --> 13:48.244
Oh, no. Who?

13:48.311 --> 13:49.312
I don't remember.

13:49.379 --> 13:50.780
I don't even know
if it happened,

13:50.847 --> 13:52.682
I just had this feeling
when I woke up this morning

13:52.750 --> 13:54.350
Like I definitely
kissed somebody.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.351
- No--

13:55.419 --> 13:57.987
- Hey. Ann.

13:58.055 --> 13:59.222
Hmm.

13:59.289 --> 14:01.457
Oh, that was a crazy night
last night.

14:03.293 --> 14:06.195
Yeah, crazy.

14:06.263 --> 14:09.832
I mean,
I left at 11:15

14:09.899 --> 14:11.567
And you were still raging
pretty hard.

14:11.635 --> 14:14.703
Oh, I was. I was.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.705
Good.

14:16.773 --> 14:17.940
Yeah.
So it's not Jerry.

14:18.008 --> 14:19.342
Help me.

14:19.410 --> 14:20.977
I'll keep an ear to the ground.

14:21.045 --> 14:22.879
But right now, I have to go
swallow my pride.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.014
Mm, mm.

14:25.082 --> 14:26.549
Leslie, Leslie.
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

14:26.617 --> 14:27.950
Hi, you have
a lot of bottles there.

14:28.018 --> 14:29.185
Oh, yeah, would you like
a vitamin?

14:29.253 --> 14:32.255
B12? Evening primrose oil?
Willow bark? Magnesium?

14:32.323 --> 14:33.823
- No, thank you.
- You sure?

14:33.891 --> 14:35.692
Really good for hangovers.
Okay, I'll take one.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.462
I take care of my body
above all else.

14:38.529 --> 14:41.499
Diet, exercise,
supplements, positive thinking.

14:41.567 --> 14:43.234
Scientists believe that
the first human being

14:43.302 --> 14:46.271
Who will live 150 years
has already been born.

14:46.339 --> 14:48.974
I believe I am
that human being.

14:49.042 --> 14:51.043
So. What brings you here
so early?

14:51.111 --> 14:53.178
I'm here to speak to Ben,
actually.

14:53.246 --> 14:54.346
Great.

14:54.414 --> 14:55.614
I'm gonna listen to
some ocean sounds

14:55.682 --> 14:58.617
And so some chin-ups.

15:01.521 --> 15:03.922
So I'd like to apologize
for yesterday.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.024
Don't worry about it.

15:06.091 --> 15:08.359
Now what I did
was out of line. Twice.

15:08.427 --> 15:11.362
And I was worked up
because obviously,

15:11.429 --> 15:12.863
You represent a threat
to my department.

15:12.930 --> 15:14.631
Your city counsel
and your Mayor

15:14.699 --> 15:16.166
Are the threats to
your department.

15:16.233 --> 15:17.366
We didn't do anything

15:17.434 --> 15:19.234
To get you into
this situation, okay?

15:19.302 --> 15:20.536
Okay, look, Ben,

15:20.604 --> 15:22.404
I don't appreciate
your callous attitude, okay?

15:22.472 --> 15:23.906
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

15:23.974 --> 15:25.207
Okay.

15:25.275 --> 15:27.776
You may hold my fate
in your hands like a small bird,

15:27.844 --> 15:31.713
But I still think
you're an ass.

15:31.781 --> 15:33.115
You wanna get a beer?

15:33.183 --> 15:35.217
It's, like,
10:30 in the morning.

15:35.285 --> 15:36.719
Yeah. You seem like
you could use a beer.

15:36.786 --> 15:38.453
Let's get a beer.

15:38.521 --> 15:39.621
- Well--

15:39.689 --> 15:41.891
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Don't keep him too long.

15:41.958 --> 15:44.426
I need someone to be here
when I take my multivitamin.

15:44.494 --> 15:46.529
There's a choking hazard.

15:46.596 --> 15:49.065
Okay, can we go?

15:49.132 --> 15:51.233
Oh, my God.

15:51.301 --> 15:52.835
You don't remember anything

15:52.902 --> 15:53.969
That happened last night,
do you?

15:54.037 --> 15:55.771
- No.
- Wow.

15:55.838 --> 15:59.207
For once, it's Ann
who blacked out drunk

15:59.275 --> 16:00.375
And not Andy.

16:00.443 --> 16:01.910
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

16:01.978 --> 16:02.977
This is--
that's really dangerous.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.212
Please tell me.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.747
This is going to be so fun

16:05.815 --> 16:08.383
Letting you dangle
until I finally reveal

16:08.450 --> 16:10.718
That we did not make out.

16:10.786 --> 16:12.119
Oh, [bleep].

16:12.187 --> 16:13.721
Damn it.

16:13.789 --> 16:16.090
Good. See ya.

16:16.158 --> 16:18.626
All right.

16:18.693 --> 16:21.695
Hey, I need to settle my bill
from last night.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.130
Tom Haverford.

16:23.197 --> 16:25.932
Okay.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.835
Wow, you had 47 drinks
last night?

16:28.903 --> 16:31.805
Ten cosmos,
eight Smirnoff ices,

16:31.873 --> 16:33.941
And everything else starts with
the word pomegranate.

16:34.008 --> 16:35.609
Aw. Was it
your bachelorette party?

16:35.677 --> 16:37.311
No.

16:37.378 --> 16:39.746
I invited a bunch of girls here
last night,

16:39.814 --> 16:42.783
And they all put drinks
on my tab.

16:42.851 --> 16:44.851
And then I went home alone.

16:44.919 --> 16:46.019
I'm not sure what happened.

16:46.087 --> 16:47.320
You invited
a bunch of girls here

16:47.388 --> 16:48.788
And then you tried to hit on
all of them.

16:48.856 --> 16:51.024
Fair enough.

16:51.092 --> 16:52.292
I mean, what were you
expecting was gonna happen,

16:52.359 --> 16:53.459
A 43-way?

16:53.527 --> 16:56.329
That would have been
a little out of control.

16:56.396 --> 16:57.530
- But awesome.
- Yeah.

16:57.597 --> 16:59.298
The problem is
I only have 15 penises.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.367
So there would have been
28 girls there

17:01.434 --> 17:02.868
That were really upset with me.

17:06.673 --> 17:10.776
All right, well, thanks.

17:13.180 --> 17:16.348
Hey, uh, would you wanna get
a drink tomorrow night?

17:18.084 --> 17:20.219
- Does it have to be here?
- No.

17:20.287 --> 17:22.121
Then sure.
I'm Lucy.

17:22.189 --> 17:25.023
Let you give me
my phone number.

17:25.092 --> 17:27.794
Mm.

17:27.862 --> 17:28.962
Wow, that tastes really good.

17:29.030 --> 17:31.464
Mm. How's your head?

17:31.532 --> 17:34.200
Mushy.

17:34.268 --> 17:35.835
I'm sorry that I yelled at you.

17:35.903 --> 17:37.136
All three times.

17:37.204 --> 17:38.838
But I don't think
you know anything

17:38.905 --> 17:40.172
About my department.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.908
Have you ever been part of
a government body before?

17:42.975 --> 17:44.943
Uh, I have. Yeah.

17:45.011 --> 17:47.312
In a small town
called partridge, Minnesota.

17:49.381 --> 17:51.983
Why does that sound familiar?

17:54.654 --> 17:56.655
You're Benji Wyatt?
I am.

17:56.723 --> 17:57.990
When I was 18,

17:58.058 --> 18:01.928
I ran for Mayor of
my small town and won.

18:01.996 --> 18:05.532
Little bit of anti-establishment
voter rebellion, I guess.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.202
Here's the thing, though,
about 18-year-olds.

18:08.270 --> 18:10.071
They're idiots.

18:10.138 --> 18:11.772
So I pretty much
ran the place into the ground

18:11.840 --> 18:15.809
After two months
and got impeached.

18:15.877 --> 18:18.411
Worst part was,
my parents grounded me.

18:18.479 --> 18:20.247
Oh, my God, you were so cute.

18:20.314 --> 18:21.248
Oh, well, thank you.

18:21.315 --> 18:22.249
What was that song you played

18:22.316 --> 18:23.584
At the swearing-in ceremony?

18:23.651 --> 18:27.220
<i>Whoomp! There it is
is what it was, yeah.</i>

18:27.288 --> 18:28.788
God, I was so jealous of you.

18:28.856 --> 18:29.989
You shouldn't have been.

18:30.057 --> 18:31.691
I mean, it ended up
kind of ruining my life.

18:31.759 --> 18:33.826
I mean,
now I'm balancing budgets

18:33.894 --> 18:35.294
So I can show people
I'm responsible.

18:35.361 --> 18:37.896
And so I can
run for office again someday

18:37.964 --> 18:40.966
And not be laughed at,
you know?

18:41.033 --> 18:42.600
I mean, you wanna
run for office someday, right?

18:42.668 --> 18:46.070
Yeah. How'd you know?

18:46.138 --> 18:47.271
Well, you have to be able
to make decisions

18:47.339 --> 18:48.406
Like this, Leslie.

18:48.473 --> 18:50.207
You have to be harsh.
You know?

18:50.275 --> 18:51.708
No one's gonna elect you
to do anything

18:51.776 --> 18:54.411
If you don't show that
you're a responsible grown-up.

18:54.478 --> 18:56.412
Yeah.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.713
Well.

18:57.781 --> 19:00.116

Can I call you?

You have my phone number?

20:38.948 --> 20:41.149
No, you couldn't remember

21:04.609 --> 21:05.576
Why?

Our investigation has revealed

21:08.013 --> 21:10.247
That things in Pawnee
