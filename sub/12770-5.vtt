00:07.625 --> 00:10.041
( suspenseful theme playing )

00:10.083 --> 00:11.834
ADDISON:
There are basically five steps

00:11.875 --> 00:13.500
to the IVF process.

00:13.542 --> 00:16.041
One, they stimulate
and monitor the development

00:16.083 --> 00:18.917
of healthy eggs
in the ovaries.

00:18.959 --> 00:20.959
Two, they harvest the eggs.

00:21.041 --> 00:24.000
Three, they select
and secure sperm.

00:24.041 --> 00:28.041
Four, they combine the egg
and the sperm in a lab

00:28.083 --> 00:31.041
and provide an appropriate
environment for fertilization

00:31.083 --> 00:32.959
and early embryo growth.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.834
And five,
they select--

00:35.875 --> 00:41.041
Identify the best embryos
and transfer them to the uterus.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.041
I'm at step one. Heh.

00:43.083 --> 00:45.333
How are you feeling
about that?

00:45.375 --> 00:49.000
I feel like...

00:49.041 --> 00:50.125
Heh.

00:50.166 --> 00:51.917
Like I'm at step one.

00:53.083 --> 00:54.709
I got hormones.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.625
Congratulations.
You pulled the trigger.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.000
It's not quite
congratulations yet

00:58.041 --> 01:00.000
because I haven't pulled
the trigger,

01:00.041 --> 01:02.500
because the shots
go in my ass.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.250
Sam can't pull the trigger?

01:04.291 --> 01:05.875
I like to be sexy with Sam,

01:05.917 --> 01:08.083
and shots
that stimulate egg production?

01:08.125 --> 01:09.083
Not sexy.

01:09.125 --> 01:10.834
Enough said.

01:12.959 --> 01:14.542
Okay.

01:18.083 --> 01:20.166
And this stays between us,
right?

01:20.208 --> 01:22.709
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.000
( clears throat )

01:29.083 --> 01:30.458
God, I miss Naomi.

01:37.291 --> 01:39.041
What are you--?
What are you doing?

01:39.083 --> 01:40.625
Just calm down.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.875
Massaging the area
helps to absorb the hormones.

01:42.917 --> 01:46.083
I'm deriving absolutely
no pleasure from this

01:46.125 --> 01:47.709
whatsoever.

01:47.750 --> 01:50.000
ADDISON:
Well, ahem, thank you.

01:53.083 --> 01:55.041
Now it's congratulations.

01:55.083 --> 01:57.041
Well, my FSH is really high.

01:57.083 --> 02:00.166
I don't know if I'll get any
good eggs out of it.

02:00.208 --> 02:02.083
It's still congratulations.
There's no way to know

02:02.125 --> 02:04.792
unless you try
and you're trying.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.917
WES:
It's not safe.
No one should go up.

02:11.959 --> 02:13.041
Wes. Wes.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.875
No one is gonna do anything
to you, honey.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.542
You wanted to give them
your painting.

02:16.583 --> 02:17.667
I'm not going up there.

02:17.709 --> 02:19.333
I don't wanna be here, Mom.
It's not safe.

02:19.375 --> 02:21.792
No one should get in there.
Karen. Wes. Everything okay?

02:21.834 --> 02:23.333
He's refusing to take
his heart meds.

02:23.375 --> 02:25.000
He's refusing
to take any meds.

02:25.041 --> 02:27.792
Hey, Wes. Is this your painting
here? It's really beautiful.

02:27.834 --> 02:30.458
Is that this building, Wes?
Yeah. The elevators hear.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.583
They hear you.
SAM: Right.

02:31.625 --> 02:32.709
They want you to go in.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.041
Know who would love
to see this?

02:34.083 --> 02:36.166
I'm not going up.
Dr. Turner.

02:36.208 --> 02:37.375
Dr. Turner, Wes.

02:37.417 --> 02:39.083
Why don't we both take
the stairs up--?

02:39.125 --> 02:41.542
They hear you
and they watch you.

02:41.583 --> 02:44.041
He needs to start seeing
her again. He's in trouble.

02:44.083 --> 02:46.000
Everything's gonna be okay.
Why don't you--?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.125
I can't go up there.
All right.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.125
I can't be here.

02:48.166 --> 02:49.500
I can't. I can't. I can't.

02:49.542 --> 02:51.333
KAREN:
Take that.

02:55.750 --> 02:57.041
( door opens )

03:00.750 --> 03:02.083
Ah!

03:02.125 --> 03:04.542
I can't believe you have been
running around Italy

03:04.583 --> 03:07.041
for six months.
I'm jealous.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.583
Don't be jealous.
Just go.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.750
And get the pizza in Naples.
It is insane.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.542
And then head straight
to Rome,

03:13.583 --> 03:16.166
buy a large box of condoms
and never leave.

03:16.208 --> 03:19.583
Italian men are ridiculous.
And they're everywhere.

03:19.625 --> 03:20.959
Italian men in Italy?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.583
Just standing around
in Armani suits, eating gelato.

03:23.625 --> 03:26.041
Waiting to get attacked
by a predatory American tourist.

03:26.083 --> 03:30.417
Never a tourist.
There I am che donna stupenda.

03:30.458 --> 03:31.417
A hot piece of ass.

03:31.458 --> 03:33.208
Ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.375
When did your symptoms
start?

03:38.417 --> 03:40.583
Couple months ago,
in Ravello.

03:40.625 --> 03:41.875
We can try meds.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.667
There are ways that
we can manage your symptoms.

03:43.709 --> 03:45.166
Amelia, thanks to you,

03:45.208 --> 03:47.166
I had a beautiful six months
in Italy,

03:47.208 --> 03:50.208
which I wouldn't have had,
and I am grateful.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.792
So grateful.

03:52.834 --> 03:56.500
But I'm not gonna die
a slow death from Huntington's.

03:56.542 --> 03:59.041
I am not going the way
my mother did.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.041
I'm not. You promised.
Michelle-- I know, but--

04:01.083 --> 04:02.709
It's time, Amelia.

04:02.750 --> 04:06.417
I mean, I've had great food,

04:06.458 --> 04:08.500
great sex,

04:08.542 --> 04:10.041
great love in my life.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.291
And a great friend.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.041
I'm happy.

04:14.083 --> 04:15.291
And I'm ready.

04:16.333 --> 04:19.917
I need you
to help me die.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.542
( knocking on door )

04:30.583 --> 04:32.500
VIOLET:
All right, you wanna open it?

04:32.542 --> 04:35.250
All right. Open it up.

04:35.291 --> 04:37.041
Hi. Hey, Uncle Sam.
How you doing?

04:37.083 --> 04:38.417
Hey, buddy.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.834
Hey, have you ever, um,
baked anything?

04:40.875 --> 04:42.542
Like tried to bake?
Because it's hard.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.500
Really hard.

04:44.542 --> 04:45.750
I had no idea how hard it was.

04:45.792 --> 04:47.917
It's harder than med school.
Yeah.

04:47.959 --> 04:50.000
We have a little 2-year-old
sous-chef here.

04:50.041 --> 04:51.959
( Violet mimics airplane
propeller whirring )

04:52.000 --> 04:53.458
LUCAS: I want candy.
SAM: I...

04:53.500 --> 04:55.250
Yes. You.
Why are you here?

04:55.291 --> 04:57.083
It's Wes.
Do you remember him?

04:57.125 --> 04:58.583
Patient, the painter.
I know Wes.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.709
He's off his meds.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.542
Psych meds or heart meds?
All of them.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.166
He won't see Sheldon,
he won't listen to me.

05:04.208 --> 05:05.875
You're the only one he trusts.

05:05.917 --> 05:08.041
I know that you can't talk
to him officially,

05:08.083 --> 05:09.291
but--
Damn it.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.709
Unofficially,
I was thinking maybe--

05:11.750 --> 05:13.583
Yeah. I'll get a sitter.
All right.

05:13.625 --> 05:15.041
Watch him for a minute?
Yeah.

05:15.083 --> 05:16.834
What's happening,
buddy boy?

05:19.083 --> 05:21.041
If you and Mason are gonna be
seeing each other,

05:21.083 --> 05:23.500
we should set some rules.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.458
Ground rules. Okay.
Yeah.

05:30.834 --> 05:33.291
First, your wife--
Yeah.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.041
--is not allowed to speak to
Mason or be anywhere near him.

05:37.083 --> 05:39.000
Charlotte should never
have done what she did,

05:39.041 --> 05:41.125
but she's sorry.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.625
She's actually very different
once you get to know her.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.625
No, thanks.
Secondly,

05:45.667 --> 05:48.250
I don't want you telling Mason
that you're his father.

05:49.542 --> 05:51.709
Ever?
For now.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.625
Okay. If you wanna see Mason,
those are my conditions.

05:59.709 --> 06:03.083
Beautiful. All of this is
so beautiful.

06:06.375 --> 06:08.834
The colors.
The textures.

06:08.875 --> 06:12.709
Everything around us.
It's life on a canvas.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.041
Hey, Wes. It's me.

06:20.083 --> 06:23.834
It's Dr. Turner.
Do you remember me?

06:23.875 --> 06:25.041
( scoffs )

06:25.083 --> 06:29.291
You're not Dr. Turner.
Yes. Yes, I am.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.709
Listen to me, Wes.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.792
Do you remember when we
started working together

06:36.834 --> 06:38.875
and you were living in a box
on Venice Beach?

06:38.917 --> 06:40.041
Do you remember that?

06:40.083 --> 06:41.500
And I used to come
visit you

06:41.542 --> 06:44.291
and we would talk about
how you were feeling.

06:44.333 --> 06:48.250
About the voices in your head,
the ones that frightened you.

06:48.291 --> 06:49.625
You're not Dr. Turner.

06:49.667 --> 06:52.291
Remember what happened
after that?

06:52.333 --> 06:54.375
You started taking medication

06:54.417 --> 06:57.458
and you kept coming to see me
and you got better.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.041
And you didn't live
in a box anymore.

06:59.083 --> 07:01.959
You had an apartment.
You paid rent.

07:03.667 --> 07:04.959
The apartment
on Third Street.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.750
Yes, the apartment
on Third Street.

07:06.792 --> 07:10.000
And you had a show
in the local art gallery.

07:12.250 --> 07:15.291
People loved my paintings.
They did.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.542
You made beautiful paintings.

07:19.125 --> 07:20.875
Don't you wanna get back
to that?

07:22.875 --> 07:27.834
You are not Dr. Turner.

07:27.875 --> 07:30.625
Wes.
The machines got Dr. Turner.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.667
The machines took over her mind.
They made her leave me.

07:33.709 --> 07:35.041
VIOLET: Wes.
The real Dr. Turner

07:35.083 --> 07:38.417
would never have left me.
You're a machine.

07:40.500 --> 07:44.000
And I'm not talking
to you anymore.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.875
Michelle is 30,
her CAG count is 43.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.500
She should've had a couple more
years before symptoms started.

07:52.542 --> 07:53.542
How advanced are they?

07:53.583 --> 07:56.125
Tremors, rigidity,
seizures.

07:56.166 --> 07:58.041
The younger the onset,
the faster they progress.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.250
It's a daunting prospect,

07:59.291 --> 08:01.166
but there are support groups
and therapy.

08:01.208 --> 08:03.709
And she'll still have time where
she's lucid and functional.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.000
But she doesn't want the time,
does she?

08:10.792 --> 08:12.208
She wants me to euthanize her.

08:18.083 --> 08:19.542
Your friend Michelle,
is she a puppy?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.083
Because unless
she's a puppy--

08:21.125 --> 08:23.500
I promised her I would.

08:23.542 --> 08:26.166
It was the only way I could
stop her from killing herself

08:26.208 --> 08:28.208
when she found out
she had the Huntington's gene.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.375
Wait, Amelia.

08:29.417 --> 08:31.041
The puppy thing
is kind of a good point.

08:31.083 --> 08:33.125
Why are we more humane
in our treatment of animals--?

08:33.166 --> 08:35.083
You're not considering this?
He did it.

08:35.125 --> 08:36.500
Okay, okay, okay.

08:36.542 --> 08:38.041
One, when I tell you something,

08:38.083 --> 08:39.542
just keep it to yourself,
okay?

08:39.583 --> 08:41.041
And two,

08:41.083 --> 08:44.125
my patient was in his seventies.
He was in excruciating pain

08:44.166 --> 08:45.875
and he only had
a couple of weeks to live.

08:45.917 --> 08:48.458
What if you were seizing and
losing control of your muscles,

08:48.500 --> 08:49.750
of your bowels,
of your mind?

08:49.792 --> 08:52.208
Would you want to stick around
for that?

08:52.250 --> 08:53.959
You took an oath.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.458
AMELIA:
You think I would do less harm

08:55.500 --> 08:58.625
by letting her die slowly
and painfully?

08:58.667 --> 09:00.667
I know you're sad.
I know you're scared,

09:00.709 --> 09:02.542
I know you wanna help
your friend.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.583
This is not how to do it.

09:03.625 --> 09:05.667
Physician-assisted suicide
is legal

09:05.709 --> 09:07.542
in Washington
and in Oregon--

09:07.583 --> 09:09.625
But in California,
we're talking about murder.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.041
You got that, right?

09:11.083 --> 09:13.208
You're talking
about committing a murder.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.041
I got one. What do I do?
What?

09:25.083 --> 09:26.625
What? Wait.
COOPER: Oh, reel it in.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.083
Reel it in.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.041
There you go. Nice and steady.
Oh, my God.

09:30.083 --> 09:32.166
Mason, you really got one.
COOPER: Steady.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.792
ERICA: Yeah.
COOPER: There you go.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.291
Bring it up. Bring it up.
Yes.

09:36.333 --> 09:37.458
Yeah.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.667
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.

09:39.709 --> 09:40.792
( shudders )

09:40.834 --> 09:42.458
Good job, man.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.875
ERICA: Check that out.
Look at that, man.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.792
I'm hungry.
You want a hot dog?

09:47.834 --> 09:49.041
Sure.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.709
ERICA: Hot dog? Ha-ha-ha.
No thanks.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.166
You're pretty good.
You wanna go again?

09:58.709 --> 10:01.542
Are you dating my mom?

10:01.583 --> 10:02.834
No, we're just friends.

10:02.875 --> 10:04.333
Well, whenever my mom

10:04.375 --> 10:06.041
has a friend that's a guy,

10:06.083 --> 10:08.667
it usually means
that he's her boyfriend.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.041
And her boyfriends
are kind of dumb.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.709
Oh, well, it's a good thing
I'm not her boyfriend then, huh?

10:14.750 --> 10:16.625
I mean, do you think
a dumb boyfriend

10:16.667 --> 10:19.583
could do like this?

10:23.125 --> 10:25.875
If it's all right,
I kind of wanna go find my mom.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.625
Okay. Go ahead.

10:34.709 --> 10:36.792
Hey.
Hey.

10:36.834 --> 10:38.750
So did you hear about
my former patient?

10:38.792 --> 10:41.166
My schizophrenic patient, Wes,
who because I was suspended

10:41.208 --> 10:43.458
and forced to stop seeing him,
has stopped taking meds.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.583
And is living
on the streets

10:44.625 --> 10:46.458
talking to traffic lights.
I heard.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.041
It's not okay.
It's not okay.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.083
Okay.
I'm thinking about suing.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.667
You're gonna sue a homeless guy?
The medical board.

10:52.709 --> 10:55.291
And if I can't sue,
then I am gonna go to the press

10:55.333 --> 10:58.041
and I am gonna bring attention
to this system.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.041
To this process
that is so broken,

11:00.083 --> 11:02.333
I don't even know
where to start fixing it.

11:02.375 --> 11:03.959
Okay, are you angry at me?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.542
Because you're actually
yelling at me.

11:05.583 --> 11:08.125
No. Oh, no, Addison.
I just--

11:08.166 --> 11:09.500
Ever since Pete's
heart attack,

11:09.542 --> 11:11.625
I feel like I've been trying
to be the perfect wife

11:11.667 --> 11:14.417
and mother and not a doctor.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.375
I haven't let myself realize
the effect that my suspension

11:17.417 --> 11:20.500
has had on my patients
whom I just abandoned.

11:20.542 --> 11:22.166
You didn't completely
abandon them.

11:22.208 --> 11:23.208
No, I did. I did.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.500
That's how it feels
to them.

11:24.542 --> 11:25.542
And it sucks.

11:27.583 --> 11:32.041
Nai used to put food
on top of feelings.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.333
Addison, I'm a therapist.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.667
I don't eat for comfort.
That's not healthy.

11:35.709 --> 11:36.792
It's disordered eating.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.500
Try a doughnut hole.
They help.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.208
They're good, right?

11:48.166 --> 11:51.125
Hey. I got an idea about Wes.
You got a moment?

11:51.166 --> 11:54.000
Yeah. I have nothing but.
How you doing? You good?

11:54.041 --> 11:56.000
I'm great.
I have doughnut holes.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.458
Oh.

12:01.709 --> 12:04.250
You wanna lock my son up?
Not exactly.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.166
We just wanna keep him
in a psych hold.

12:06.208 --> 12:09.041
Because of Wes' pattern
of destructive behavior,

12:09.083 --> 12:10.875
severe delusions
which result in him

12:10.917 --> 12:12.208
not taking
his heart medication--

12:12.250 --> 12:13.792
He could die.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.625
We think we could get a judge
to sign off on the hold.

12:15.667 --> 12:18.625
I had him committed before,
Dr. Turner. It makes it worse.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.041
Being held down
and being strait-jacketed?

12:21.083 --> 12:22.625
His paranoia
goes off the charts.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.041
And then
when he goes off his meds,

12:24.083 --> 12:27.375
which he always eventually does,
he trusts me less.

12:27.417 --> 12:30.583
I need him to trust me.
I'm his mom.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.834
The only way I can be there for
him at all is if he trusts me.

12:35.125 --> 12:38.208
I... I can't have him
committed.

12:39.709 --> 12:43.500
I mean, he's still my boy.
He's in there.

12:43.542 --> 12:46.041
He's somewhere in there.
You know, in the cracks.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.917
In the moments
where those voices get quiet,

12:47.959 --> 12:50.959
he's my wonderful,
wonderful boy.

12:52.583 --> 12:58.500
I won't allow you to hold Wes
against his will.

12:58.542 --> 13:01.041
And if you pursue this,

13:01.083 --> 13:02.458
I will fight you.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.583
( suspenseful theme playing )

13:14.792 --> 13:16.625
How did you do it?

13:20.542 --> 13:21.709
Morphine.

13:22.542 --> 13:24.500
My patient was halfway there
on a cocktail

13:24.542 --> 13:25.709
of sedatives
and sleeping pills,

13:25.750 --> 13:27.750
so it didn't take much.

13:27.792 --> 13:29.291
What happened?

13:30.750 --> 13:31.959
After you gave him
the drugs?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.333
Well, at first
he was ecstatic.

13:34.375 --> 13:37.709
Maybe because he was free
from the pain.

13:37.750 --> 13:41.125
But after his body started
to shut down,

13:41.166 --> 13:45.041
well, there was so much fear.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.125
He said
it was what he wanted,

13:47.166 --> 13:49.750
but I don't think
he was prepared for the...

13:49.792 --> 13:52.834
How terrifying
and lonely it was.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.709
And what did you do?

13:55.750 --> 13:57.041
I stayed with him
till it was over.

13:59.792 --> 14:02.542
It takes
an emotional toll on you.

14:05.208 --> 14:07.125
Sometimes I wonder
if I gave him the morphine

14:07.166 --> 14:09.750
because I was the one
who couldn't take it anymore.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.500
That if I had been
stronger for him,

14:12.542 --> 14:16.041
maybe he would've died in his
sleep, without any of that

14:17.166 --> 14:21.041
regret or despair.

14:21.083 --> 14:24.000
If you knew then
how you would feel now,

14:26.291 --> 14:27.583
would it have stopped you?

14:27.625 --> 14:31.166
No. But that was different.

14:31.208 --> 14:32.834
And no matter
what Michelle says,

14:32.875 --> 14:36.041
she has no idea what it's really
like to face death, believe me.

14:38.083 --> 14:42.208
It's not gentle or sweet
or a relief.

14:43.792 --> 14:44.667
I gave her my word.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.667
Then take it back.

14:47.583 --> 14:48.750
Take back your word

14:48.792 --> 14:52.041
before you ruin your life
and your career.

14:52.083 --> 14:54.041
Take it back.

14:54.083 --> 14:57.041
( suspenseful theme playing )

15:04.041 --> 15:06.208
So have you seen
Amelia?

15:06.250 --> 15:07.667
I don't have her on GPS.

15:07.709 --> 15:08.875
I'm just worried.

15:08.917 --> 15:10.041
So am I.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.500
You don't think
she would actually--?

15:11.542 --> 15:13.917
I don't know.
I don't...

15:13.959 --> 15:16.500
I'm sick. I'm actually
worried a little sick.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.583
I mean,
physically nauseous.

15:18.625 --> 15:21.041
But I'm not her shrink,
I'm not her father.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.041
That's the way you feel
about her? Fatherly?

15:23.083 --> 15:25.041
You two have been spending
a lot of time together.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.542
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm feeling. Except sick.

15:27.583 --> 15:28.750
Hey.
Hey.

15:28.792 --> 15:30.917
How was fishing with the kid?
It was good.

15:30.959 --> 15:34.542
He'd never been before, he did
great. He caught two fish.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.083
Which he couldn't care
less about.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.750
No, it wasn't good.
It was awkward.

15:37.792 --> 15:39.417
It was weird and awkward,

15:39.458 --> 15:43.333
and it was like he didn't wanna
have anything to do with me

15:43.375 --> 15:44.583
and I just don't get it.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.709
PETE: Hi.
Hey.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.709
Hey.
Hey.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.542
What now?

15:54.583 --> 15:58.583
Mason and I were getting
along great, until--

15:58.625 --> 16:00.792
Until what?

16:00.834 --> 16:01.959
If you're having an issue
with him,

16:02.000 --> 16:03.375
it has nothing to do
with me.

16:03.417 --> 16:06.041
I only talked to the mother.
We hung out and it was awkward

16:06.083 --> 16:08.000
and it never was before.
If Erica hates you,

16:08.041 --> 16:11.542
or us, that is gonna
influence Mason.

16:11.583 --> 16:14.041
Coop, I understand you're going
through a rough patch.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.083
If you think you can blame me
because an 8-year-old

16:16.125 --> 16:17.875
doesn't want to share
a corn dog with you,

16:17.917 --> 16:20.000
you have another thing
coming.

16:29.583 --> 16:31.625
ADDISON:
Son of a bitch.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.041
( mouths ):
Excuse me.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.041
Hey. Is everything okay?

16:35.083 --> 16:37.750
No, I'm very definitely
not okay.

16:37.792 --> 16:41.041
If you try to do one thing,
one simple thing,

16:41.083 --> 16:43.625
like rename the practice
and suddenly,

16:43.667 --> 16:45.625
I'm in a blizzard of paperwork,
you know?

16:45.667 --> 16:47.750
I got the building
management people,

16:47.792 --> 16:49.041
I've got
the insurance company.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.709
Oh, I've even got the guy

16:50.750 --> 16:54.583
who paints our damn
parking spaces.

16:54.625 --> 16:57.542
This is not
what I signed up for.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.083
Heavy is the head.

17:02.125 --> 17:03.667
Seriously?
Are you trying to piss me off?

17:03.709 --> 17:07.583
Because I'm looking for someone,
anyone, whose face I can just--

17:10.417 --> 17:12.041
It's not your fault.
I'm sorry.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.875
You have massive doses
of hormones

17:13.917 --> 17:15.041
coursing
through your veins,

17:15.083 --> 17:16.792
your emotions are elevated,

17:16.834 --> 17:18.041
your filter is gone.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.875
You feel like you've been hit
by a PMS truck.

17:19.917 --> 17:21.750
No kidding.
How do I make this stop?

17:21.792 --> 17:23.208
Just breathe, okay?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.625
And if you start to feel
like you wanna cry or scream

17:25.667 --> 17:28.542
or rip somebody's face off,
walk away.

17:28.583 --> 17:31.417
Go someplace quiet.
Avoid emotional triggers, like--

17:31.458 --> 17:33.041
Sam.
Hey.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.208
Hey.
What's going on?

17:34.250 --> 17:35.458
Just giving Addison
a pep talk

17:35.500 --> 17:37.041
on how to get
through paperwork.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.166
Hang in there.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.500
You okay?
Yeah.

17:41.542 --> 17:45.500
Sweetie, I'm right there
with you.

17:45.542 --> 17:49.458
Ugh. I hate this thing
that's going on with Wes.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.834
I feel so bad for his mother.
I feel bad for my moth--

17:51.875 --> 17:54.834
I feel bad for all mothers
everywhere.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.208
Did you know that Wes
was a perfectly normal kid

17:57.250 --> 17:59.041
up until
he was Maya's age?

17:59.083 --> 18:02.208
So you're worried
that Maya might have, um,

18:02.250 --> 18:03.375
a schizophrenic break?

18:03.417 --> 18:04.709
Yes, I am.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.625
And I'm worried about
a million other things

18:06.667 --> 18:10.500
because my baby girl's
living in New York City.

18:10.542 --> 18:11.625
She's a blessing.

18:11.667 --> 18:15.750
Maya is the biggest blessing
of my life,

18:15.792 --> 18:17.208
but sometimes,
I don't know...

18:17.250 --> 18:21.333
Sometimes I just wonder
if not having the burden,

18:21.375 --> 18:24.041
of the fear and the stress
of having a child,

18:24.083 --> 18:27.000
maybe that's a blessing too.

18:29.750 --> 18:32.250
You know what I mean?
Addie, where are you going?

18:32.291 --> 18:35.500
Going for a walk.
Addie.

18:35.542 --> 18:37.041
( cell phone ringing )

18:37.083 --> 18:38.375
Addie.

18:39.458 --> 18:40.709
Yeah, this is Dr. Bennett.

18:42.792 --> 18:44.792
Okay. I'll be right there.

18:46.583 --> 18:50.875
So, what happens
after I'm gone?

18:50.917 --> 18:52.792
I call the police.

18:52.834 --> 18:54.709
I tell them I found you.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.583
And they'll think
I took pills?

19:07.709 --> 19:10.083
Hold this.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.125
Put some fingerprints on it.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.041
Should I just take
the pills?

19:15.083 --> 19:19.125
You could end up
in an irreversible coma

19:19.166 --> 19:21.667
or with just really bad
liver damage.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.542
I don't want to get you
in trouble.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.000
I don't want you
to suffer.

19:31.583 --> 19:33.583
( mellow pop music playing )

19:52.917 --> 19:57.375
First, I'll inject a benzo
to relax you.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.792
Then a barbiturate.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.458
It'll put you under.

20:03.625 --> 20:06.000
And finally,
potassium chloride.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.792
It'll stop your heart.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.291
Okay. I'm ready.

20:54.208 --> 20:56.000
Thank you.

21:36.959 --> 21:38.709
I love you.

21:39.750 --> 21:41.792
I know.

21:45.792 --> 21:47.792
If you see my dad,

21:49.291 --> 21:51.583
you tell him I said hi,
okay?

21:51.625 --> 21:55.709
Maybe I'll fix him up
with my mom.

22:17.208 --> 22:19.208
( gasping heavily )

22:19.250 --> 22:21.083
Why can't I breathe?

22:21.125 --> 22:23.625
You could be having
an adverse reaction.

22:23.667 --> 22:25.208
I'm gonna keep going,
okay?

22:25.250 --> 22:28.333
This barbiturate will depress
your central nervous system.

22:28.375 --> 22:30.041
Amelia.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.583
Should I keep going
or should I stop?

22:31.625 --> 22:33.041
I don't know what that means.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.709
Stop.
Okay.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.041
Okay, I'm stopping.

22:36.083 --> 22:37.125
It's okay, Michelle.

22:37.166 --> 22:39.041
I'm gonna call 911.
Michelle?

22:39.083 --> 22:41.417
It's okay. Michelle,
it's okay. I'm stopping.

22:41.458 --> 22:44.000
( intense pop music playing)

22:47.166 --> 22:48.542
No. Get away from me.

22:48.583 --> 22:50.041
He had a psychotic episode

22:50.083 --> 22:51.333
and collapsed on the street.

22:51.375 --> 22:52.583
His mom called it in.

22:52.625 --> 22:55.875
He was upset. He was ranting
at a kid on his cell phone

22:55.917 --> 22:57.125
and then he just dropped.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.875
They'll take over.
Can I get help?

22:58.917 --> 23:00.875
Okay, he's got
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

23:00.917 --> 23:03.041
It's gone unmedicated.
Probably arrhythmia.

23:03.083 --> 23:04.834
CHARLOTTE:
He came in the ambulance.

23:04.875 --> 23:07.792
Thinks the EKG and every other
machine was trying to kill him.

23:07.834 --> 23:09.959
Can't you hear?
Can't you hear it?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.792
They're trying to send signals
into our brain.

23:11.834 --> 23:15.375
CHARLOTTE:
Let's 51, 50 him and 5
milligrams of haloperidol IV.

23:15.417 --> 23:17.667
You gotta trust me.
WES: You're not my friend.

23:17.709 --> 23:19.041
You're trying to poison me!

23:19.083 --> 23:21.208
Sweetie,
please let the doctors help you.

23:21.250 --> 23:22.291
What are you doing to him?

23:22.333 --> 23:24.041
SAM:
Gonna put him on a psych hold.

23:24.083 --> 23:27.625
Mom. Mom, make them stop.
Make them stop.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.458
Don't let the machines
get me!

23:29.500 --> 23:31.875
Haloperidol, 10 milligrams.
Stop! You're hurting him!

23:31.917 --> 23:34.375
Get her out of here.
WES: No!

23:34.417 --> 23:35.625
All right.

23:35.667 --> 23:38.834
WES:
Mom! Mom! Mom, don't leave me!

23:38.875 --> 23:42.417
Don't let them
do this to me! Mom!

23:42.458 --> 23:44.667
It's respiratory distress.
Secondary to benzo.

23:44.709 --> 23:47.542
Okay, I need point two
milligrams of flumazenil IV.

23:47.583 --> 23:49.750
And 02 at 6 liters.
She got a hold of drugs, Pete.

23:49.792 --> 23:52.792
I don't know how. She did
this herself. I found her--

23:54.542 --> 23:56.291
She changed her mind.

23:56.333 --> 23:58.041
She had a bad reaction
and she changed her mind.

23:58.083 --> 24:00.041
Pull an intubation tray.
Let me help.

24:00.083 --> 24:01.583
No, Amelia,
it's time to step back.

24:01.625 --> 24:02.917
Please, Pete.

24:02.959 --> 24:04.625
Amelia, it's time to go.
Go to the waiting room.

24:04.667 --> 24:06.583
I'll keep you updated.

24:56.208 --> 24:58.083
So I've gotten to know
all of the guys here,

24:58.125 --> 25:00.667
but you women are harder
to crack. You're like a coven.

25:00.709 --> 25:03.375
Oh, God.

25:03.417 --> 25:05.041
It's just the hormones.

25:05.083 --> 25:06.375
Don't even pay
attention to me.

25:06.417 --> 25:09.000
I'm just being ridiculous.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.709
I've heard that before.

25:10.750 --> 25:14.166
I feel like my brain is broken.
And that.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.166
I hate my boyfriend.
Heard that the most.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.625
Do you know he basically said
it's a blessing

25:18.667 --> 25:19.959
that I can't have children?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.500
Doesn't sound like Sam.

25:21.542 --> 25:23.166
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what he said.

25:23.208 --> 25:25.875
"It's a blessing."
A blessing. Really?

25:25.917 --> 25:27.750
For whom is it a blessing?
Him?

25:27.792 --> 25:29.458
Is that the only reason
that he's with me?

25:29.500 --> 25:31.041
He thinks
I'll never get pregnant?

25:31.083 --> 25:32.166
Because I prefer to think

25:32.208 --> 25:33.834
that it's because
I'm awesome in the sack.

25:33.875 --> 25:35.458
Addison. Addison,
listen to me. Okay?

25:35.500 --> 25:37.041
I can't get myself zipped.

25:37.083 --> 25:38.834
You're brave to do this,
okay?

25:38.875 --> 25:41.041
It's a brave and wonderful thing
you're trying to do.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.000
And all of the thoughts
and tears

25:43.041 --> 25:46.417
and
"I hate my boyfriend" talk

25:46.458 --> 25:48.375
is just the hormones, okay?

25:48.417 --> 25:50.750
But the fact of the matter is
you cannot do this alone.

25:50.792 --> 25:53.041
Of course I can.
Lots of women do.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.834
No, they don't.
Even single women.

25:54.875 --> 25:57.041
They have friends and family
and book clubs.

25:57.083 --> 25:59.417
( chuckles )
You're afraid to tell

25:59.458 --> 26:02.041
because you're trying to keep it
secret from your boyfriend.

26:02.083 --> 26:03.583
What are you gonna
tell Sam

26:03.625 --> 26:05.083
if you get pregnant?

26:05.125 --> 26:06.625
Or when you're
six months along?

26:06.667 --> 26:08.041
What are you gonna do
when the baby comes?

26:08.083 --> 26:09.250
Hide it
in the liquor cabinet?

26:09.291 --> 26:11.417
I've seen the road
you're heading down,

26:11.458 --> 26:13.041
and you're not gonna make it

26:13.083 --> 26:15.625
unless you have people
on your team.

26:23.625 --> 26:24.792
Hey.
Hi.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.875
Um, this isn't gonna--
I have to cancel.

26:27.917 --> 26:29.875
I'm sorry about
the late notice.

26:29.917 --> 26:33.041
What? Wait. Why? Why?
He had a meltdown.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.500
Ten minutes ago.
Sorry I didn't call you sooner,

26:35.542 --> 26:37.917
but I was kind of busy trying
to talk him out of his bedroom.

26:37.959 --> 26:39.834
It's not me.

26:39.875 --> 26:41.750
Mason doesn't want
to spend time with you.

26:43.375 --> 26:45.041
Oh.

26:45.083 --> 26:46.083
Did he say why?

26:46.125 --> 26:48.959
He's 8, who knows why?

26:49.000 --> 26:50.500
But if he doesn't want to
spend time with you,

26:50.542 --> 26:51.917
I can't force him.

26:51.959 --> 26:54.000
Maybe that would change
if he knew I was his father?

26:55.333 --> 26:57.500
You say you want to be a dad,
but are you ready?

26:57.542 --> 26:59.750
I mean, I'm not talking
about buying him stuff

26:59.792 --> 27:01.583
or pulling a quarter
out of his ear.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.208
I'm talking about
have you thought about

27:03.250 --> 27:05.250
making room in your life
for him?

27:05.291 --> 27:08.542
Or your home? Have you talked
to your bitch of a wife about--

27:08.583 --> 27:09.750
Don't call her that.

27:09.792 --> 27:11.542
--how fatherhood
would change your lives?

27:11.583 --> 27:12.917
Yes, I have.
I really have.

27:12.959 --> 27:14.083
I get that
she scared you off.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.709
I get that you think
that she's awful

27:15.750 --> 27:17.667
and I must be awful
if I' married to her,

27:17.709 --> 27:18.917
but you really
don't know her.

27:18.959 --> 27:21.250
She's like a mama bear
when she's threatened,

27:21.291 --> 27:22.375
and you threatened her.

27:22.417 --> 27:24.542
Or she thought
you were threatening me,

27:24.583 --> 27:29.917
and so she, you know,
growled loudly and...

27:29.959 --> 27:31.375
Okay, the metaphor
wears thin,

27:31.417 --> 27:33.542
but my point is
my wife loves me,

27:33.583 --> 27:36.417
and so she will love Mason
because I love him.

27:37.542 --> 27:40.041
He's my son.
And I love him.

27:40.083 --> 27:42.166
And you were the one
who showed up in my life

27:42.208 --> 27:45.041
to tell me that he exists
and I'm glad you did.

27:45.083 --> 27:46.917
And maybe you wish
you could take that back now,

27:46.959 --> 27:48.208
but you can't.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.709
You wanted Mason
to have a father?

27:50.750 --> 27:53.166
Now he does.

27:53.208 --> 27:55.417
Now he does.

27:55.458 --> 27:57.000
( mellow pop music playing )

28:00.625 --> 28:03.583
Hey. Have you seen Amelia?
Hey.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.375
You okay?

28:11.125 --> 28:12.750
You're worried about him.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.041
Yeah, I'm just waiting
for Sam or anyone

28:14.083 --> 28:16.834
to come and update me because
I'm not allowed in his room.

28:16.875 --> 28:20.041
That new lawyer is working
overtime to re-open my case,

28:20.083 --> 28:22.625
so I am following the letter
of the law.

28:22.667 --> 28:25.041
No contact
with my former patients,

28:25.083 --> 28:27.458
but, um, yeah,
I'm worried about him.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.583
I'm worried about
all of them.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.667
It's gonna be okay,
Violet.

28:33.625 --> 28:35.458
How?
I don't know.

28:35.500 --> 28:38.250
I don't know how,
I just...

28:39.709 --> 28:41.041
This is my favorite thing
about you.

28:41.083 --> 28:42.625
When I get the crazy eyes?

28:42.667 --> 28:44.875
No. That--
That's pretty cute too,

28:44.917 --> 28:46.083
but my favorite thing
about you

28:46.125 --> 28:47.792
is how much you care
about your patients.

28:47.834 --> 28:51.208
I'm glad
you're fighting the board.

28:51.250 --> 28:54.041
I'm glad you're remembering
things you like about me.

29:00.625 --> 29:01.750
( knocking on door )

29:01.792 --> 29:03.250
SHELDON:
Amelia!

29:04.875 --> 29:08.041
Amelia, open the door. I know
you're in there. I saw your car.

29:08.083 --> 29:11.583
Amelia, open the door because
I'm not leaving until you do.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.000
Amelia!

29:24.959 --> 29:26.542
Are you crazy?

29:26.583 --> 29:28.667
Are you actually
clinically insane?

29:28.709 --> 29:29.834
Did you really
do this thing?

29:29.875 --> 29:31.750
Because even I didn't think
you were stupid enough

29:31.792 --> 29:33.709
and crazy enough
to actually go through with it!

29:33.750 --> 29:36.834
Do you get that you basically
confessed your crime to me

29:36.875 --> 29:38.250
before you did it?

29:38.291 --> 29:40.542
Do you get that I could
and should call the police?

29:40.583 --> 29:43.417
And if that woman had died,
I would call the police.

29:43.458 --> 29:46.041
Because I am not gonna be
an accessory to murder.

29:46.083 --> 29:47.667
What is wrong with you?

29:47.709 --> 29:49.500
Why are you
this self-destructive?

29:53.333 --> 29:54.750
She didn't die?

29:56.083 --> 29:57.709
She's alive?

29:57.750 --> 29:59.792
Yes.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.583
She's alive.

30:03.375 --> 30:05.500
( sobbing )

30:30.834 --> 30:32.709
You ready to go?

30:32.750 --> 30:34.041
Yeah.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.959
I got you.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.375
You okay?

30:41.959 --> 30:43.750
I'm sorry.

30:43.792 --> 30:45.041
I am so sorry.

30:45.083 --> 30:48.709
Do not apologize to me.
I mean it.

30:48.750 --> 30:49.959
I was so sure
that I wanted to die,

30:50.000 --> 30:51.917
but now I don't--
I don't know.

30:51.959 --> 30:54.959
I just-- I don't know
if I panicked or--

30:55.000 --> 30:56.959
Hey, you don't have to
figure it out today.

30:57.041 --> 30:59.250
Or tomorrow for that matter.

31:01.083 --> 31:02.625
I know it's not easy
being alone.

31:02.667 --> 31:05.709
Your mom had you
and you--

31:07.375 --> 31:10.000
You have me.
I will be there the whole way.

31:10.041 --> 31:11.458
You can even move in
if you want.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.750
Oh, I couldn't do that
to you.

31:12.792 --> 31:14.125
You'd be helping me too.

31:14.166 --> 31:15.583
I know it doesn't compare

31:15.625 --> 31:18.458
to what you're going through,

31:18.500 --> 31:21.041
but I struggle too.
Every day.

31:21.083 --> 31:24.375
Pills?
Booze.

31:24.417 --> 31:27.000
I'm branching out.

31:28.208 --> 31:31.333
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.

31:31.375 --> 31:33.375
You don't have to be sorry.

31:33.417 --> 31:35.041
So we're both screwed up,

31:35.083 --> 31:37.417
but maybe we can be there
for each other.

31:37.458 --> 31:38.792
Like some kind of--

31:38.834 --> 31:40.709
Like some kind of messed up
buddy system.

31:40.750 --> 31:43.625
You know, I won't drink today
if you don't kill yourself.

31:43.667 --> 31:47.041
( both chuckle )

31:47.083 --> 31:49.458
Deal?

31:49.500 --> 31:51.000
Deal.

31:59.959 --> 32:03.875
We got his heart stabilized.
For now.

32:03.917 --> 32:05.375
How are you doing there,
Wes?

32:05.417 --> 32:06.667
KAREN:
He can't hear you.

32:06.709 --> 32:08.542
Not when he's like this.

32:08.583 --> 32:10.917
That's why he never could stay
on his meds.

32:10.959 --> 32:14.333
He said they made him feel like
he was 10 feet underwater.

32:14.375 --> 32:16.709
Working with Dr. Turner helped,

32:16.750 --> 32:19.333
but I knew
it was just a matter of time.

32:20.542 --> 32:23.750
We should talk about
other options for Wes.

32:23.792 --> 32:25.500
What to do next.

32:25.542 --> 32:28.500
I think that you should legally
petition for a conservatorship.

32:28.542 --> 32:31.041
You'll be able to make
all of Wes' medical decisions.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.083
Place him in a facility
for his own safety.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.959
We already
went through this.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.250
Hear me out.

32:36.291 --> 32:38.709
I'm not talking about
a temporary psych hold here.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.750
I'm talking about something--
I said no.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.709
I'm not gonna put my son
in some clinic

32:42.750 --> 32:45.125
where they keep him locked
and drugged.

32:45.166 --> 32:47.500
I won't do that to him.

32:51.709 --> 32:56.041
Uh, my sister,
Corinne.

32:56.083 --> 32:58.083
She was a lot like Wes.

32:58.125 --> 33:00.834
She made a habit
of disappearing too.

33:00.875 --> 33:04.458
My mother would do everything
she could to keep her home,

33:04.500 --> 33:08.500
but Corinne
would always find a way out.

33:08.542 --> 33:11.041
One day, she left

33:11.083 --> 33:12.417
and she never came back.

33:13.583 --> 33:15.000
That was a long time ago.

33:15.041 --> 33:18.792
I still don't know
if she's dead or alive.

33:18.834 --> 33:20.500
But I do know

33:20.542 --> 33:22.583
that my mother's
never been the same.

33:23.667 --> 33:26.000
I've never been the same.

33:28.083 --> 33:29.417
I know that you love Wes,

33:29.458 --> 33:32.125
and that you respect
his right to be free.

33:32.166 --> 33:37.500
But are you prepared for the day
that he walks out of your life

33:37.542 --> 33:38.917
and disappears forever?

33:38.959 --> 33:40.667
I don't...

33:41.959 --> 33:45.375
My son is an artist.

33:45.417 --> 33:47.041
He's a thinker.

33:47.083 --> 33:52.583
He's funny and sharp
and he's passionate.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.583
Do you see that man,
Dr. Bennett?

33:57.917 --> 34:00.750
Do you see my son in this bed?

34:00.792 --> 34:03.041
If I keep him like this,

34:03.083 --> 34:06.000
then he's already disappeared.

34:21.041 --> 34:22.792
( both moan softly )

34:22.834 --> 34:25.083
Carlos, Carlos,
you have to leave.

34:25.125 --> 34:27.041
My boyfriend's
gonna be home soon.

34:27.083 --> 34:29.208
Carlos?
Heh, heh.

34:29.250 --> 34:33.041
You know-- You know I have a
soft spot for the Latin lovers.

34:33.083 --> 34:34.500
You better watch it.
Oh!

34:34.542 --> 34:36.959
What's the matter?
What happened?

34:38.834 --> 34:40.291
What's up?

34:41.667 --> 34:44.041
I started...

34:44.083 --> 34:48.166
I started IVF treatments
a couple of days ago.

34:48.208 --> 34:50.917
I am sore.

34:50.959 --> 34:52.041
IVF.

34:52.083 --> 34:54.542
Jake's been giving them
to me.

34:54.583 --> 34:55.542
Jake?
Yeah,

34:55.583 --> 34:57.959
Jake's the only one
who knows.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.417
I didn't want the entire office
gossiping about it.

35:01.458 --> 35:02.500
I'm sorry.

35:02.542 --> 35:05.417
No, no. It's okay.

35:05.458 --> 35:06.667
Huh.

35:07.625 --> 35:09.083
Um...

35:11.500 --> 35:13.125
I don't want to have
another kid,

35:13.166 --> 35:16.083
because I already
got mine through.

35:16.125 --> 35:18.959
What?
No, I was

35:19.000 --> 35:20.625
terrified every single day

35:20.667 --> 35:24.458
of Maya's childhood,
but I got her through.

35:24.500 --> 35:27.041
I mean, it was--
It was wonderful

35:27.083 --> 35:28.792
and it was terrible.
Both equal parts.

35:28.834 --> 35:31.041
And it's definitely an
experience that you should have

35:31.083 --> 35:34.542
if that's what you want,
but...

35:34.583 --> 35:38.250
I just don't know if
I have it in me to do it again.

35:38.291 --> 35:41.458
But that doesn't mean

35:41.500 --> 35:44.041
that I don't support you.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.750
That doesn't mean
that I don't love you.

35:50.500 --> 35:53.417
And it doesn't mean that you
get to keep secrets from me.

35:55.583 --> 35:57.750
Okay?

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Okay.

36:03.083 --> 36:05.583
( grunting )

36:05.625 --> 36:07.625
Hands off the ass.

36:07.667 --> 36:10.250
I'm sorry.

36:14.333 --> 36:18.709
Michelle! Get in here!
We're doing girls night in.

36:18.750 --> 36:23.500
I got rocky road and a DVD
of the second Twilight movie.

36:23.542 --> 36:26.000
The one with
all the hot werewolves.

36:26.041 --> 36:27.583
Michelle?

36:29.250 --> 36:31.250
( tense theme playing )

36:49.875 --> 36:54.000
She had a degenerative disease
that was progressing rapidly.

36:55.667 --> 36:58.000
It was painful
and she was taking OxyContin.

36:59.083 --> 37:02.041
Those bottles hold 30 pills.

37:02.083 --> 37:04.041
I found a bunch
on the bed beside her.

37:04.083 --> 37:07.083
If she got half of them down,
she didn't last long.

37:08.709 --> 37:10.834
You all right,
Dr. Shepherd?

37:10.875 --> 37:13.500
You have someone
you can call?

37:15.250 --> 37:16.667
I'm all right.

37:16.709 --> 37:19.583
You're sure?
No.

37:19.625 --> 37:22.583
I miss my friend.

37:22.625 --> 37:25.500
So I'm not all right.

37:27.625 --> 37:29.917
But I will be.

37:34.041 --> 37:36.417
I'll be fine.

37:36.458 --> 37:37.667
All right.

37:37.709 --> 37:41.709
( tense theme playing )

38:02.792 --> 38:06.458
Are you sure you won't ride
in a taxi with me?

38:06.500 --> 38:11.709
Cars aren't safe, Mom.
Please don't ride in cars.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.834
The night sky is much better
for you than cars.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.500
Okay, honey.

38:17.709 --> 38:19.709
You're gonna need
some money.

38:19.750 --> 38:21.542
Okay.

38:21.583 --> 38:23.041
Okay.

38:23.083 --> 38:26.750
And I want you to have
my phone number

38:26.792 --> 38:29.000
and not lose it.

38:33.834 --> 38:36.709
Thanks for saving me.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.083
You're my hero.

38:41.583 --> 38:43.917
You're mine.

38:43.959 --> 38:47.333
( tense theme playing )

39:04.250 --> 39:06.125
You're still here.

39:06.166 --> 39:07.709
Yeah.

39:07.750 --> 39:09.000
I thought
you might need a ride.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.667
Thank you.

39:26.291 --> 39:27.583
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me.

39:27.625 --> 39:30.625
Okay, thanks for this.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.709
Hey, Mason.

39:34.667 --> 39:37.500
So, uh, I had fun yesterday.

39:40.083 --> 39:43.250
And I'd love to, you know,
keep hanging out if...

39:43.291 --> 39:45.750
If you don't like fishing,

39:45.792 --> 39:47.375
we can do something else,
you know?

39:47.417 --> 39:49.375
Whatever you want,
really.

39:49.417 --> 39:52.041
Uh...

39:52.083 --> 39:54.417
Are you my dad?

39:57.083 --> 39:58.792
I'm pretty sure you are.

39:58.834 --> 40:00.375
I look like you.

40:00.417 --> 40:03.542
And mom acts weird
when she talks about you.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.917
How do you feel about that?

40:07.959 --> 40:10.041
MASON:
I don't know.

40:10.083 --> 40:14.917
But if you're not gonna be
around, like all the other guys,

40:14.959 --> 40:16.250
we can't be friends.

40:16.291 --> 40:19.250
( mellow pop music playing )

40:22.417 --> 40:23.625
He's your dad, Mason.

40:26.625 --> 40:29.875
I am your dad.

40:31.792 --> 40:33.750
And, uh...

40:35.583 --> 40:36.542
I'm not going anywhere.

40:43.959 --> 40:47.667
So you want to watch
some Phineas and Ferb?

40:47.709 --> 40:49.959
It's good.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.709
Yeah.

41:14.542 --> 41:16.250
ADDISON:
Step one is the hardest.

41:16.291 --> 41:21.291
I mean, they say that
kind of about everything.

41:21.333 --> 41:25.041
You know, it's like
when you watch a baby

41:25.083 --> 41:26.750
take her first step.

41:26.792 --> 41:30.041
I mean, she's spent days
and weeks and months

41:30.083 --> 41:34.458
literally teaching her muscles
how to function.

41:34.500 --> 41:37.041
But once they do,
it's never that hard again.

41:37.083 --> 41:40.667
Okay.
You are all set.

41:45.542 --> 41:47.625
Do you want to be
my fertility doctor?

41:47.667 --> 41:50.542
I mean, mine's fine,
she's great.

41:50.583 --> 41:52.625
But you're clearly
the better choice for me.

41:52.667 --> 41:55.750
I mean, that's assuming
that you would still take me on.

41:55.792 --> 41:57.125
I wouldn't blame you
if you didn't--

41:57.166 --> 42:00.041
Yes.

42:00.083 --> 42:02.375
THERAPIST:
So, what muscle did you train

42:02.417 --> 42:05.041
in order to take this step?

42:05.083 --> 42:08.000
You'll laugh.

42:08.041 --> 42:10.458
I won't.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.792
Hope.

42:12.834 --> 42:15.750
I had to learn

42:15.792 --> 42:19.291
to let myself hope.

42:25.709 --> 42:27.709
( upbeat theme playing )
