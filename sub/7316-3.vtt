WEBVTT

00:04.217 --> 00:06.043
[classical music plays on radio]Yes, I'm almost there.

00:06.086 --> 00:09.826
[indistinct voice over phone]Hmm... another half hour.

00:09.869 --> 00:11.000
Relax.

00:11.043 --> 00:13.043
Everything's going
according to plan.

00:13.086 --> 00:15.869
I've been to the Smithsonian,

00:15.913 --> 00:18.347
Mount Vernon,

00:18.391 --> 00:22.173
and a dreadful abomination
called Foamhenge.

00:22.217 --> 00:24.173
If anybody's following me,

00:24.217 --> 00:25.695
they'll think
I'm just sightseeing.

00:25.739 --> 00:27.043
We're good.

00:27.086 --> 00:29.347
MAN [over phone]:
Foamhenge?

00:29.391 --> 00:30.869
Yes, it's an actual replica
of Stonehenge,

00:30.913 --> 00:33.869
except it's all made
out of foam.

00:33.913 --> 00:35.347
Pure disaster.

00:35.391 --> 00:36.434
Just when you think

00:36.478 --> 00:37.608
you've seen everything...

00:42.086 --> 00:43.130
Oh, dear.

01:17.739 --> 01:22.304
Burton Moore was born in 1977
in a small town in Wyoming.

01:22.347 --> 01:25.217
He received a BS in geology from
the University of Wisconsin.

01:25.260 --> 01:28.173
Then spent almost a decade
in the Peace Corps

01:28.217 --> 01:29.173
before moving to DC.

01:29.217 --> 01:30.130
ABBY:
Record?

01:30.173 --> 01:32.086
He was arrested once.

01:32.130 --> 01:33.086
Oh...

01:33.130 --> 01:34.304
But for protesting a zoo

01:34.347 --> 01:35.956
that was accused
of abusing their animals.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.086
Oh!
Uh-huh.

01:37.130 --> 01:38.043
We also have
his yearly salary,

01:38.086 --> 01:39.043
favorite bands,

01:39.086 --> 01:40.347
and his political positions

01:40.391 --> 01:41.347
on everything
from the Middle East

01:41.391 --> 01:42.521
to Middle Earth.

01:42.565 --> 01:44.043
Which he's a big fan of,
by the way.

01:44.086 --> 01:45.260
I can hang with
Middle Earth.

01:45.304 --> 01:48.130
Oh, Code McBlue,
Code McBlue, Code McBlue.

01:48.173 --> 01:50.782
It's a purple grommet.Yeah. Hmm.

01:50.826 --> 01:51.826
What's going on?

01:51.869 --> 01:52.913
Nothing.
Nothing.

01:57.913 --> 02:00.043
McGEE: That's the park ranger
that was here a few weeks ago.

02:00.086 --> 02:01.869
[chuckles]
Oh, yeah.
Mmm... yeah.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.086
Are these two doing
background for you?

02:04.130 --> 02:07.173
It totally looks like that, huh?

02:08.826 --> 02:10.695
Places of residence,

02:10.739 --> 02:13.043
political contributions...

02:13.086 --> 02:15.391
shoe size--
that's a myth, by the way.No, it's not.

02:15.434 --> 02:17.347
Size 12.

02:17.391 --> 02:18.695
Abby, you don't have
to hide this from me.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.000
I'm not jealous.
I have a girlfriend, remember?

02:21.043 --> 02:23.304
Oh, I wasn't worried
that you were jealous.
Good.

02:23.347 --> 02:24.608
It's the overprotective
big brother routine

02:24.652 --> 02:26.086
that's getting old.

02:26.130 --> 02:27.086
I'm not not
overprotective.

02:27.130 --> 02:28.956
Okay. So, I can date him?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.043
Absolutely not, you don't know
a thing about this guy.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.695
Aside from this totally
comprehensive background check.

02:33.739 --> 02:36.043
But that's something you two can
get into a lot of trouble for.

02:36.086 --> 02:37.956
GIBBS:
Trouble for what?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.130
Data in that file is straight
from the Internet, Boss.

02:40.173 --> 02:42.043
Yeah, we didn't use a single
law enforcement database.

02:42.086 --> 02:44.043
McGee, it's the overprotective
big brother routine

02:44.086 --> 02:45.565
that's getting old.

02:45.608 --> 02:47.130
Gear up!

02:47.173 --> 02:48.652
Got a car blast
in Virginia.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.173
You know, he's just
really not right for...

02:54.217 --> 02:56.043
Go.

03:05.086 --> 03:08.565
TONY: So, truck driver saw
the fire, called 911.

03:08.608 --> 03:09.826
GIBBS:
Any witness?

03:09.869 --> 03:12.130
Cops found fresh
tire tracks over there.

03:12.173 --> 03:14.130
Looks like a second
vehicle was parked.

03:14.173 --> 03:15.521
Why didn't they call 911?

03:15.565 --> 03:17.521
Um... did I get here before you?

03:17.565 --> 03:19.260
Got here before us.
What'd we miss?

03:19.304 --> 03:20.782
DUCKY: And don't
spare the details.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.130
I'm writing
an abstract

03:22.173 --> 03:23.739
on thermal trauma,

03:23.782 --> 03:26.521
and can use some
inspiration.

03:26.565 --> 03:27.608
You first, Duck.

03:27.652 --> 03:30.260
Victim appears to be
of advanced age.

03:30.304 --> 03:32.260
On first glance,
I would say

03:32.304 --> 03:34.521
he was ejected from the car
in the explosion.

03:34.565 --> 03:36.608
JIMMY:
Was he in the Navy?

03:36.652 --> 03:38.130
Don't know, still waiting
on an e-mail back

03:38.173 --> 03:39.130
with the vehicle registration.

03:39.173 --> 03:41.043
Why was NCIS called?

03:41.086 --> 03:43.086
'Cause of this.

03:43.130 --> 03:45.130
Police found it hidden
under the spare in the trunk.

03:45.173 --> 03:46.391
Which is probably
why it survived.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.478
TONY:
What is it?

03:47.521 --> 03:49.565
Troop deployment orders.

03:49.608 --> 03:50.869
TONY:
What's he doing with those?

03:50.913 --> 03:52.869
I'm sorry, did I get here
before you?

03:54.652 --> 03:56.434
I got that vehicle information.

03:56.478 --> 03:58.782
It's a rental registered
to an Angus Clarke.

03:58.826 --> 04:01.130
Oh, I knew an Angus Clarke
growing up.

04:01.173 --> 04:05.130
Yeah, he lived on a beautiful
tree-lined street.

04:05.173 --> 04:07.000
Came from a wealthy family
in, uh...

04:07.043 --> 04:09.869
Beaconsfield?

04:09.913 --> 04:12.695
Yes. In fact...

04:12.739 --> 04:15.000
Six-one-two-three...

04:15.043 --> 04:16.217
Clifford Avenue.

04:18.608 --> 04:21.826
Duck, who was
Angus Clarke?

04:27.173 --> 04:29.173
My best friend.

04:47.043 --> 04:49.086
When we were kids,
we used to play a game

04:49.130 --> 04:52.000
called "What's the Time,
Mister Wolf?"

04:52.043 --> 04:54.000
You would know it as "tag."

04:54.043 --> 04:59.391
To say I enjoyed it immensely
would be an understatement.

04:59.434 --> 05:04.608
In fact, I don't think I've
enjoyed anything as much since.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.695
How long has
it been, Duck?

05:06.739 --> 05:07.695
[chuckles]

05:07.739 --> 05:10.391
Too long.

05:13.565 --> 05:15.782
You don't need
to do this.

05:15.826 --> 05:17.695
We can get somebody else.

05:17.739 --> 05:18.913
No, we can't.

05:18.956 --> 05:21.913
When Kate was taken from us,

05:21.956 --> 05:24.826
and Director Shepard,
Mike Franks...

05:24.869 --> 05:29.826
their autopsies were
all I had left of them.

05:29.869 --> 05:34.521
If I wasn't willing to give up
those last moments with them,

05:34.565 --> 05:36.826
I'm sure as hell not now.

05:40.478 --> 05:43.000
I already washed the body and
logged the superficial wounds.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.304
Thank you.

05:44.347 --> 05:45.652
And I took X-rays,
including dental,

05:45.695 --> 05:46.869
to verify the identity.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.000
Thank you again.

05:48.043 --> 05:50.043
Doctor, I do have
one more question.

05:52.043 --> 05:54.956
What happens when frogs
park illegally?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.521
Excuse me?

05:56.565 --> 05:57.956
Never mind.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.869
I looked up a couple of jokes
before you got here.

05:59.913 --> 06:01.739
I thought it might help
cheer you up.

06:01.782 --> 06:03.608
It's a thought
I'm regretting right now.

06:03.652 --> 06:06.782
What happens
when frogs park illegally?

06:08.347 --> 06:11.000
They get... toad.

06:13.739 --> 06:16.652
Yeah, well, let's...

06:16.695 --> 06:17.826
start the autopsy.

06:17.869 --> 06:19.217
I couldn't agree more.

06:19.260 --> 06:20.695
Now, wait a minute.

06:20.739 --> 06:23.347
You sure these were taken
of him?
Yes.

06:23.391 --> 06:25.391
I took 'em myself.Give me that.

06:28.086 --> 06:30.695
Oh...

06:30.739 --> 06:32.000
This gentleman

06:32.043 --> 06:35.956
has both his original
central incisors.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.782
Is that a problem?Angus didn't.

06:37.826 --> 06:40.826
This isn't Angus!

06:40.869 --> 06:43.782
His two front teeth were
replaced by dental implants

06:43.826 --> 06:47.000
after they were knocked
out in a fight.

06:47.043 --> 06:49.739
Are you sure?
Yes. [laughs]

06:49.782 --> 06:51.869
I was the one that
knocked them out.

06:53.869 --> 06:56.260
MAN [over P.A.]: Train now
arriving on platform five,

06:56.304 --> 07:00.000
317 for K Street.
Platform five...

07:00.043 --> 07:03.565
The one month, unlimited
rides across the continent.

07:03.608 --> 07:04.869
Oh, lucky you.

07:04.913 --> 07:06.869
Well, last thing I'm going
to need is your name.

07:06.913 --> 07:08.826
Donnie Mallard, and I'm
somewhat in a hurry, sir.

07:08.869 --> 07:11.782
Mallard! Like the Mallard
Song of Oxford!

07:11.826 --> 07:14.695
Sung once a century
at a special ceremony.

07:14.739 --> 07:17.608
I remember when
I was a child...
Sir...

07:17.652 --> 07:20.826
My father used to talk about
the first ceremony, oh, in 1901.

07:20.869 --> 07:22.434
My pass, please.

07:22.478 --> 07:24.173
Led by Cosmo Lang.

07:24.217 --> 07:26.913
Sorry.
Coming through.Most people don't realize...

07:26.956 --> 07:28.347
I'm so sorry, sir--
this man's a doctor,

07:28.391 --> 07:30.565
and he's needed
in surgery immediately.

07:30.608 --> 07:31.826
My apologies, and thank you
for the fascinating insight.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.478
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bloody hell.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.391
I thought the old sod
would never shut up.

07:35.434 --> 07:37.652
What are you doing here?Well, Father gave
me the night off.

07:37.695 --> 07:39.217
Thought I might
take you to dinner

07:39.260 --> 07:41.695
before you
disappear tomorrow.Ah, I've already eaten.

07:41.739 --> 07:43.521
Oh, dear. Well, I suppose we'll
just have to get plastered then.

07:43.565 --> 07:46.260
Works for me.So, when do you report
for basic training?

07:46.304 --> 07:48.608
30 days-- as soon
as I get back from my trip.

07:48.652 --> 07:49.956
So, what I want
to know is,

07:50.000 --> 07:51.826
why does somebody
spend all that time

07:51.869 --> 07:53.086
learning to be a doctor,

07:53.130 --> 07:55.434
and then he signs up
to Royal Army Medical Corps?

07:55.478 --> 07:57.000
'Cause not all of us
are set to inherit

07:57.043 --> 07:58.652
the family fortune
when we grow up.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.434
Speaking of which, gonna have
to go past Daddy's hotel.

08:01.478 --> 08:02.782
I left my wallet there.

08:02.826 --> 08:05.347
Forget it.
Forget what?

08:05.391 --> 08:08.130
I know what you're up to.
It is as plain as a pikestaff.

08:08.173 --> 08:10.043
What am I up to?You clearly have arranged

08:10.086 --> 08:11.956
some sort of surprise
going-away party

08:12.000 --> 08:14.043
and are trying to lure
me to the location

08:14.086 --> 08:16.913
knowing full well that
I despise surprise parties.

08:16.956 --> 08:19.173
Ah. Now, you see,
I knew I wouldn't be able

08:19.217 --> 08:23.260
to lure you to the hotel,
so, um...

08:23.304 --> 08:26.000
[whistling]ALL:
Surprise!

08:32.043 --> 08:33.913
ABBY:
You hear the good news?

08:33.956 --> 08:35.913
Our victim is not
Ducky's best friend.

08:35.956 --> 08:38.260
Well, that's good news
for Ducky's best friend.

08:38.304 --> 08:39.956
I was trying to look
at the positive.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.913
And the DNA sample
that Jimmy gave me.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.782
And, then, hopefully,
we can find out

08:43.826 --> 08:45.695
whose bestie this guy is.

08:45.739 --> 08:47.043
I was able to identify

08:47.086 --> 08:48.695
the source of
the explosion.

08:48.739 --> 08:51.782
It's a shell from an
AT4 anti-tank weapon.

08:51.826 --> 08:54.826
How's that for overkill?You trace the source, Abbs?

08:54.869 --> 08:57.739
I'm trying, but the AT4
is the most common

08:57.782 --> 08:59.652
anti-tank weapon
in the world.

08:59.695 --> 09:01.869
I did find intrigue,
though, on what was left

09:01.913 --> 09:04.521
of our victim's car's
navigation system.

09:04.565 --> 09:08.000
He programmed NCIS
as his destination.

09:09.695 --> 09:11.565
He was coming
to the Navy Yard.
Maybe he was

09:11.608 --> 09:12.782
returning those
classified documents

09:12.826 --> 09:14.826
to lost and found
or something.

09:14.869 --> 09:16.086
And that's not all
he had on him.

09:16.130 --> 09:17.739
The flash drive
that we found

09:17.782 --> 09:19.521
was corrupted
from the heat,

09:19.565 --> 09:21.652
but I was able to reconstruct
some of the file structures.

09:21.695 --> 09:25.869
Our victim had dossiers on
at least three Naval officers.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.173
Like, their photos, and
their job descriptions.

09:28.217 --> 09:29.739
All sorts of stuff.Anything in common?

09:29.782 --> 09:32.826
Yeah. They're all dead.
How?

09:32.869 --> 09:34.217
It's not like they were murdered
or anything.

09:34.260 --> 09:37.043
Natural causes and accidents.

09:37.086 --> 09:38.826
This guy had a car accident.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.000
And a heart attack,
this guy fell off the roof

09:41.043 --> 09:43.304
when he was replacing
a solar attic fan.

09:43.347 --> 09:44.913
I mean, it's weird, right?

09:44.956 --> 09:46.391
I mean, I thought
I'd have some sort of theory,

09:46.434 --> 09:48.000
but I've got nothing.

09:49.304 --> 09:52.130
Oh. Except our victim's
identity.

09:52.173 --> 09:55.782
I'll take that.

09:55.826 --> 09:58.130
TONY:
Our victim is Samuel Colpepper.

09:58.173 --> 10:00.695
British national,
arrived last week on business.

10:00.739 --> 10:03.043
Customs say he was traveling
with this man.

10:03.086 --> 10:04.956
That is Ducky's
friend Angus.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.304
Colpepper works
for him.

10:06.347 --> 10:08.956
He manages one
of the hotels Angus owns.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.260
Apparently, he owns a few.Ducky's friend
still stateside?

10:11.304 --> 10:13.130
No. Flew back
to England three days ago.

10:13.173 --> 10:14.956
Colpepper stayed behind
a couple of days

10:15.000 --> 10:17.086
to do some shopping, judging
by his credit card charges.

10:17.130 --> 10:19.086
What were they
doing here?

10:19.130 --> 10:21.043
Uh, meeting with
local businessmen.

10:21.086 --> 10:23.826
That Angus's office.
They gave me a list of names.

10:23.869 --> 10:26.043
But, Gibbs, nobody's heard
from Angus since he got back.

10:26.086 --> 10:27.956
UK police are looking for him.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.521
I made a few calls, too.

10:30.565 --> 10:31.608
No luck.We know

10:31.652 --> 10:33.043
Colpepper was coming to NCIS.

10:33.086 --> 10:35.521
It's a possibility
he was coming to see you.

10:35.565 --> 10:37.043
Duck?

10:37.086 --> 10:39.695
Well, I can't imagine
why an employee of Angus's

10:39.739 --> 10:41.000
would have a list

10:41.043 --> 10:42.869
of deceased Navy sailors,

10:42.913 --> 10:44.521
some classified material,

10:44.565 --> 10:47.130
or why he would be
bringing it to me.

10:49.391 --> 10:51.869
We got nothing.Well, then
get something.

10:51.913 --> 10:53.260
Interview all the businessmen
Angus and Colpepper met with?

10:53.304 --> 10:55.173
On it, boss.McGee,

10:55.217 --> 10:57.260
open up the files again.And make sure those accidents
were really accidents.

10:57.304 --> 10:58.260
On it.

10:58.304 --> 10:59.347
Bishop...On it.

10:59.391 --> 11:01.652
Pack a bag.Uh, where am I going?

11:01.695 --> 11:05.043
England; interview Angus
as soon as he turns up.

11:05.086 --> 11:06.869
On it.

11:06.913 --> 11:08.782
Ifhe turns up.

11:08.826 --> 11:10.652
Hey, Duck,

11:10.695 --> 11:11.869
don't you have
some vacation time

11:11.913 --> 11:13.956
you haven't used up?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.652
I have all of it, in fact.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Thank you.

11:24.304 --> 11:27.086
C-Care for
a traveling companion?

11:27.130 --> 11:29.304
Took you long enough.[chuckles]

time you saw him?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.043
Mallard.

11:40.086 --> 11:42.000
You bloody bastard.

11:42.043 --> 11:45.173

11:53.217 --> 11:56.173
DUCKY: All I'm saying is
that you ought to be evaluated

11:56.217 --> 11:57.695
for sleep apnea.

11:57.739 --> 11:59.782
It's called snoring, okay?
And you did your fair share

11:59.826 --> 12:01.782
while I was trying
to sleep, too.

12:01.826 --> 12:03.782
[chuckles]
I do not snore.

12:03.826 --> 12:07.000
Okay. Tell that to
rows four through 29.

12:07.043 --> 12:09.826
Agent Bishop, Dr. Mallard.

12:09.869 --> 12:12.086
I recognize you
from the old photos.

12:12.130 --> 12:15.043
We spoke on the phone.
Gareth Godfrey, Mr. Clarke's
personal assistant.

12:15.086 --> 12:17.956
Thank you
for meeting us.Has there been any word?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.913
I checked in with the local
police when we landed.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.434
Nothing new.We're all worried sick.

12:21.478 --> 12:24.217
It's unlike Mr. Clarke
to disappear like this.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.869
Maybe we can be
of some assistance.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.695
Yeah, would it be possible
to have a look at his office?

12:28.739 --> 12:30.391
I'm afraid that's out of the
question-- per Mr. Clarke,

12:30.434 --> 12:32.043
no one is allowed in his office.

12:32.086 --> 12:33.739
No one.
And no exceptions.

12:33.782 --> 12:35.739
However, these are
exceptional times.

12:35.782 --> 12:37.217
So we will make one.

12:37.260 --> 12:38.652
My husband is missing.

12:38.695 --> 12:40.652
These people might
be able to help.

19:33.304 --> 19:35.260

Really? I have to ask?

19:48.913 --> 19:50.217

19:54.782 --> 19:55.739
This guy

19:55.782 --> 19:57.086
fell asleep
while driving.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.695

19:58.739 --> 20:00.260
to see if he'd been drinking.

20:00.304 --> 20:02.086
He wasn't.Right.

20:02.130 --> 20:03.913
But I dug a little deeper,
and I found

20:03.956 --> 20:05.304
breakdown products
that would be missed

20:05.347 --> 20:07.391
by a regular
blood panel.

20:07.434 --> 20:08.739
I think he was drugged.

20:08.782 --> 20:10.043
And I found something similar

20:10.086 --> 20:12.739
in every autopsy report.

20:12.782 --> 20:14.391

20:29.304 --> 20:30.739
Supposedly.

20:30.782 --> 20:32.130
And this one...

20:34.565 --> 20:36.347
...is not dead.

20:36.391 --> 20:38.173
You sure?Yeah.

20:38.217 --> 20:40.347
He's the only one
on the list that's not dead.

20:40.391 --> 20:42.304
ABBY:
Yet.

20:42.347 --> 20:44.347
You guys need
to go find him.

20:44.391 --> 20:46.043
Fast.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.043
You read the article
I sent, right?

20:55.086 --> 20:57.304
Yeah, 84,000 chemicals
on the market today.

20:57.347 --> 21:00.000
Only 200 have been tested
for human safety.

21:00.043 --> 21:02.434
People have no idea how...Commander? NCIS.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.391
Oh, excuse me!We would like to speak with you.

21:04.434 --> 21:07.608
I'll call you back.
Can this wait?

21:07.652 --> 21:10.043
I need to keep my heart rate up
for another ten minutes.

21:10.086 --> 21:12.652
No. Sorry. We need you to come
back to the Navy Yard with us.Sorry...

21:12.695 --> 21:14.782
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what this is about.

21:14.826 --> 21:16.913
We found a list of dead sailors
at a crime scene.

21:16.956 --> 21:19.565
And you're on it.Me? Why? I'm not dead.

21:19.608 --> 21:21.434
We think it's a hit list.

21:23.869 --> 21:25.565
[laughs]

21:25.608 --> 21:26.608
This is a joke, right?

21:26.652 --> 21:28.043
Matthews put
you up to this.

21:28.086 --> 21:30.000
Uh, no joke.

21:30.043 --> 21:32.695
No, one of the murders was made
to look like a heart attack.

21:32.739 --> 21:35.304
Heart attack. Hmm.

21:35.347 --> 21:37.739
Do I look like the type
that has a heart attack to you?

21:37.782 --> 21:40.521
There was one that was supposed
drunk-driving accident.

21:40.565 --> 21:41.782
I don't drink, I don't smoke.

21:41.826 --> 21:43.695
Look, I'm in the prime
of my life, guys.

21:43.739 --> 21:45.913
I intend to live until
I'm at least... [coughs]

21:45.956 --> 21:47.260
Un... [coughs]

21:47.304 --> 21:50.391
[coughing continues]

21:50.434 --> 21:51.782
Commander?

21:52.565 --> 21:53.695
McGee, call 911.

21:53.739 --> 21:57.478
[coughing, gasping]

21:57.521 --> 21:59.608
Any news on
Commander Bucket?
He's stable.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.956
Apparently, he did have
some kind of allergic reaction.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.434
Good thing Gibbs was there.Mm.

22:04.478 --> 22:06.782
He's debriefing him
in the hospital.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.434
Did you catch up with the woman
from Angus' office?

22:09.478 --> 22:11.521
Yeah. She works here.

22:11.565 --> 22:13.434
Claims she got kicked
out of her apartment

22:13.478 --> 22:15.391
and was just using Angus' room
to crash.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.565
There was only one bed.I know.

22:17.608 --> 22:20.826
I noticed that, but she insisted
there was nothing between them,

22:20.869 --> 22:23.086
and that she has no idea
where he is.

22:23.130 --> 22:24.521
I'll assume
"he" is Angus.

22:24.565 --> 22:26.000
But who's she?

22:28.086 --> 22:29.608
Never mind.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.521
And I don't care.

22:31.565 --> 22:34.086
Uh, you wanted me
to look at some photos?

22:34.130 --> 22:35.608
Yes, your husband e-mailed

22:35.652 --> 22:38.826
a series of dossiers
to an employee of his.

22:38.869 --> 22:42.913
Do any of these men
look familiar?

22:50.652 --> 22:52.913
You know what?
I just realized

22:52.956 --> 22:56.086
I've-I've never seen
Big Ben. Cheerio.

22:58.043 --> 23:02.478
No. Um... sorry I
don't recognize anything.

23:02.521 --> 23:04.173
What happened, Maggie?

23:04.217 --> 23:07.913
YOUNG MAGGIE:
What a wonderful party.

23:07.956 --> 23:10.739
And don't tell me
that you didn't have fun.

23:10.782 --> 23:13.043
If you're going
through hell, you keep going.

23:13.086 --> 23:15.739
Mm. Winston Churchill, who
wears a bow tie, by the way.

23:15.782 --> 23:19.043
Get stuffed. I'd rather
have a noose around my neck.

23:19.086 --> 23:23.478
Hmm. I do love a man
in a bow-tie.

23:23.521 --> 23:26.869
Well, you'll have to put it on.
I've no idea how.

23:26.913 --> 23:29.130
[laughs]

23:35.521 --> 23:38.565
Come with me, Mags.

23:38.608 --> 23:40.739
Where are we going?I mean tomorrow.

23:42.652 --> 23:45.000
On my trip.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.608
Donald...

23:49.826 --> 23:51.826
I have something
to tell you.

23:51.869 --> 23:54.565
I love you, Mags.

23:54.608 --> 23:57.521
I've beenin love with you
from the moment we met.

23:59.086 --> 24:01.043
I know you feel something, too.

24:01.086 --> 24:03.478
Why didn't you say something
sooner?

24:03.521 --> 24:05.782
If I'd have known, I...

24:05.826 --> 24:08.652
I'm saying something now.

24:18.130 --> 24:20.652
And what the bloody hell
is going on here?

24:20.695 --> 24:23.782
Angus.

24:23.826 --> 24:26.956
I'm sorry.Wait. Why are you sorry?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.478
I see.
MAGGIE:
It just...

24:40.521 --> 24:42.000
happened.

24:42.043 --> 24:44.000
We were going to tell you.

24:44.043 --> 24:46.000
What if Donnie had
said something sooner, huh?

24:46.043 --> 24:47.826
What does that make me,
second fiddle?!

24:47.869 --> 24:50.217
All right, mate, back off.
You're as drunk as a lord.

24:50.260 --> 24:52.782
Yeah, I'm drunk. I'm not blind.
I can see she fancies you.

24:52.826 --> 24:55.000
So which is it, Mags?

24:55.043 --> 24:57.000
Who's it gonna be, eh?

25:01.782 --> 25:03.956
Have you lost
your mind?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.260
You just tried
to snog my girl, mate!

25:06.304 --> 25:08.043
You don't even love her, Angus.

25:08.086 --> 25:11.000
And you do?!

25:12.043 --> 25:14.130
Oh, God.

25:14.173 --> 25:15.173
[laughs]

25:17.869 --> 25:19.130
Fine. Keep her.
What do I care?

25:19.173 --> 25:22.434
She's nothing but a cheap
floozy anyway.
Hey.

25:22.478 --> 25:24.043
[grunting]

25:24.086 --> 25:26.260
Mallard!

25:26.304 --> 25:27.913
You bloody bastard.

25:27.956 --> 25:30.869
[yelling]

25:31.304 --> 25:33.304
[panting]

25:33.347 --> 25:35.913
[groans]
[groans]

25:40.956 --> 25:43.217
You left.

25:47.434 --> 25:50.043
And you never came back.

25:54.173 --> 25:56.826
[sighs]

26:01.956 --> 26:03.260
Agent Gibbs here?

26:03.304 --> 26:05.000
I got the toxicology report
for the commander.

26:05.043 --> 26:07.739
He's not back from
the hospital yet.Am now.

26:07.782 --> 26:09.608
Ah. Allergic reaction
to shellfish.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.739
A residue somehow got
into his water bottle.McGEE: Somehow?

26:12.782 --> 26:14.826
Yeah. It easily
could have been an accident.GIBBS: It wasn't.

26:14.869 --> 26:15.869
Just supposed
to look like one.

26:15.913 --> 26:17.260
Petty officer have
anything to say?

26:17.304 --> 26:19.434
I drink too much coffee.
Nothing much more than that.

26:19.478 --> 26:22.304
Oh, we got something
here for you, boss.TONY: Still have no clue why

26:22.347 --> 26:23.608
these guys were targeted,
but we finally

26:23.652 --> 26:24.869
found a connection
between them.

26:24.913 --> 26:26.478
Each time one of 'em died,
someone was assigned

26:26.521 --> 26:28.869
to take over their duties.
Nothing odd there.

26:28.913 --> 26:31.000
TONY: The odd part is,
all of the replacements

26:31.043 --> 26:33.521
were Albanian.
Well, Albanian-American.

26:33.565 --> 26:35.652
All of 'em?Yeah. We did
some math and...

26:35.695 --> 26:37.217
well, McGee
did the math and...

26:37.260 --> 26:38.739
The odds of that
happening by chance

26:38.782 --> 26:40.782
are less than
one in 10,000.

26:40.826 --> 26:42.043
Bring 'em in.

26:42.086 --> 26:43.695
[laughing]

26:43.739 --> 26:46.043
Very nice. Very nice.

26:46.086 --> 26:47.739
I love watching
you guys work.

26:47.782 --> 26:50.565
[phone ringing]Honestly. Bravo. Bra...

26:50.608 --> 26:51.782
Bravo. [clears throat]

26:51.826 --> 26:53.695
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

26:53.739 --> 26:56.956
Hey. Yeah, Bishop,
what have you got?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.043
When?

26:59.086 --> 27:02.695
All right. Thanks.

27:02.739 --> 27:04.782
What does she got?

27:04.826 --> 27:07.217
Police found Ducky's friend.

27:07.260 --> 27:09.173
At the bottom of a river.

27:16.739 --> 27:18.826
You do house calls now?

27:23.869 --> 27:25.695
Don't say it. I don't want
to hear the details.

27:27.608 --> 27:30.043
I knew...
when I hadn't heard from him,

27:30.086 --> 27:31.739
that something had happened.

27:31.782 --> 27:35.130
45 years, he's never
been gone this long.

27:35.173 --> 27:37.043
No matter how bad it got.

27:37.086 --> 27:38.695
Can I get you anything?

27:38.739 --> 27:41.913
My coat.

27:44.608 --> 27:46.826
Wait a minute.

27:46.869 --> 27:49.043
My going-away present.

27:49.086 --> 27:51.826
I left it
at the club that night.

27:51.869 --> 27:53.000
Angus took it home.

27:53.043 --> 27:55.652
Kept it in his
desk for years.

27:55.695 --> 27:57.739
Eventually,
he had that stand made.

27:57.782 --> 28:00.130
That was the last time
we saw each other.

28:00.173 --> 28:02.173
There is very little in my life

28:02.217 --> 28:05.478
that I regret more
than that night.

28:05.521 --> 28:07.913
He would say
the same.

28:07.956 --> 28:11.739
Marrying me might be
the only thing that trumps it.

28:11.782 --> 28:13.782
I find that hard to believe.

28:13.826 --> 28:16.652
Angus and I were meant
to be friends.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.652
The best of
friends, but

28:19.695 --> 28:21.652
I think that was it.

28:21.695 --> 28:23.608
These last few years,

28:23.652 --> 28:25.608
we barely spoke to each other.

28:27.782 --> 28:29.086
I have to go.

28:29.130 --> 28:32.043
I need to tell his employees
before anyone else does.

28:32.086 --> 28:34.695
Angus would have wanted that.

28:36.739 --> 28:39.173
Mrs. Clarke.

28:41.608 --> 28:42.956
I don't know
how to tell you this.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.695
I think they already know.

28:47.695 --> 28:49.000
Sorry, can't help you.

28:49.043 --> 28:51.043
Can't or won't?I'm just a medical supply clerk.

28:51.086 --> 28:53.043
If want to talk about
antibiotics or prosthetics,

28:53.086 --> 28:55.043
I'm your guy. As far as how
my predecessor died,

28:55.086 --> 28:58.913
I don't know anything, except
that it was a terrible accident.

28:58.956 --> 29:01.826
And I can say that
over and over...

29:01.869 --> 29:03.565
and over if you like.

29:03.608 --> 29:05.652
[sighs]

29:08.043 --> 29:10.173
[clears his throat]

29:18.217 --> 29:20.086
How many more?

29:20.130 --> 29:23.043
Well, we've interrogated five
of the replacements,

29:23.086 --> 29:25.043
and he is the last.

29:25.086 --> 29:28.260
It's not gonna be any different.None of them know anything
about Angus Clarke.

29:28.304 --> 29:31.043
None of them know anything about
their predecessors' deaths.

29:31.086 --> 29:32.391
None of them know anything.

29:32.434 --> 29:33.869
Except they know everything.

29:33.913 --> 29:35.565
They're not hiding it
very well.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.478
Must be pretty confident we
can't tie them to the murders.

29:37.521 --> 29:39.565
Well, we haven't yet,

29:39.608 --> 29:41.217
but I found something
interesting here.

29:41.260 --> 29:42.956
I was going over their
service files,

29:43.000 --> 29:44.913
and it turns out
that all of them listed

29:44.956 --> 29:48.086
the same emergency contact on
their systems application.

29:48.130 --> 29:50.434
Albania's a pretty
small country.It's not that small.

29:50.478 --> 29:52.000
Contact is named
Gareth Ahmeti.

29:52.043 --> 29:54.000
I did some checking.

29:54.043 --> 29:56.000
He's reported to be a member
of the Albanian mafia.

29:56.043 --> 29:58.304
Specialty is assassination.

29:58.347 --> 30:00.043
Interpol says he's living
in the UK,

30:00.086 --> 30:01.304
under the name Gareth Godfrey.

30:01.347 --> 30:03.695
GODFREY:
He was truly,

30:03.739 --> 30:06.086
truly a remarkable man.

30:06.130 --> 30:08.347
[Godfrey sighs heavily]

30:08.391 --> 30:10.434
I just need a moment.

30:10.478 --> 30:11.956
Perhaps a drink?

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Actually, we were...Thank you.

30:18.391 --> 30:19.826
McGEE:
Gareth Ahmeti

30:19.869 --> 30:21.173
worked his way
up the Albanian mafia

30:21.217 --> 30:22.869
by having a knack
for killing people.

30:22.913 --> 30:24.434
Why is he still free?

30:24.478 --> 30:26.130
No one's ever lived
to testify against him.

30:26.173 --> 30:28.086
Interpol thinks that
he was sent to the UK

30:28.130 --> 30:31.000
to keep an eye on a
prostitution and smuggling ring.

30:31.043 --> 30:33.521
And what they were
smuggling was weapons.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.652
Abby finally traced the AT4
that took out our victim's car.

30:36.695 --> 30:38.043
I called the Joint
Munitions Command.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.739
Turns out, there's a whole bunch
of 'em missing.

30:39.782 --> 30:41.652
One of the replacements works
at the Joint Munitions Command.

30:41.695 --> 30:43.565
TONY:
Weapons disappeared

30:43.608 --> 30:45.347
right after he took over
the department.

30:45.391 --> 30:46.826
Any guesses what we'd find

30:46.869 --> 30:48.434
if we were to audit
their supply departments?

30:48.478 --> 30:50.217
Lot of missing supplies.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.652
This guy's in medicine,
this guy's in ammo.

30:52.695 --> 30:53.956
TONY:
So, it's a smuggling ring.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.782
The Albanian mafia has enlisted
in our military.

30:56.826 --> 30:59.608
So, Ahmeti takes out
the department heads,

30:59.652 --> 31:02.043
which moves their people
into a positions to steal?

31:02.086 --> 31:03.956
McGEE: Maybe that's
what Ducky's friend

31:04.000 --> 31:05.478
was trying to tell us.Where is he now?

31:05.521 --> 31:07.826
Uh, nobody knows.I do. I do.

31:07.869 --> 31:09.434
Sorry I'm eaves...
eavesdropping.

31:09.478 --> 31:11.391
But I was really bored
down in autopsy,

31:11.434 --> 31:13.913
and I-I do enjoy
watching you guys work.

31:13.956 --> 31:17.434
Where?
Uh, Gareth helped

31:17.478 --> 31:19.086
Dr. Mallard make a Skype call.

31:19.130 --> 31:21.826
And the doctor said he was
Angus Clarke's assistant.

31:21.869 --> 31:23.739
TONY:
Probably just a cover.

31:29.565 --> 31:30.913
He was so good to me.

31:32.652 --> 31:34.956
One of the best
employers I ever had.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.478
[phone ringing]

31:38.521 --> 31:40.304
Ah. Excuse me.

31:40.347 --> 31:41.521
GIBBS:
Duck, are you there?

31:41.565 --> 31:42.869
Yes. Jethro.

31:42.913 --> 31:44.565
[Gibbs speaking indistinctly]No.

31:44.608 --> 31:46.869
Did he ever say
anything about me?

31:48.521 --> 31:51.434
He was always so scarce with
his praise, I've wondered.

31:51.478 --> 31:54.304
I'm sure Angus was satisfied
with your work.

31:54.347 --> 31:56.086
His standards weren't very high.

31:57.608 --> 31:58.956
I mean...

31:59.000 --> 32:00.826
I'm-I'm sorry, Gareth,

32:00.869 --> 32:03.521
I-I need to have a word
in private with Maggie.

32:03.565 --> 32:04.826
No...

32:04.869 --> 32:06.260
you don't!

32:06.304 --> 32:08.478
Godfrey, what on earth
are you doing?

32:08.521 --> 32:11.826
Jethro... you must mean
one of your friends

32:11.869 --> 32:13.565
from NCIS.

32:17.869 --> 32:19.782
Sit down.

32:19.826 --> 32:21.695
Both of you.

32:32.521 --> 32:35.000
No, Bishop, you get there
as fast as you can.I need to know

32:35.043 --> 32:37.478
what law enforcement agencies
are near Finchley.We need to know if your NCIS

32:37.521 --> 32:39.478
office has use of a chopper.Are you even

32:39.521 --> 32:41.391
in England?I'm gonna say it
a third time:

32:41.434 --> 32:43.521
Stop. Stop.Imminent danger
of bodily harm.

32:43.565 --> 32:46.478
Call your contacts
and see who can meet you.McGEE: That's correct.

32:46.521 --> 32:47.521
GIBBS: And keep trying Clarke's
home phone number

32:47.565 --> 32:49.217
and call Ducky's cell.

32:49.260 --> 32:51.391
It's a shame,
Dr. Mallard.

32:51.434 --> 32:54.173
I just came by to see
if Margaret suspected anything.

32:54.217 --> 32:56.782
If you weren't here,
she might've lived.

32:56.826 --> 32:58.347
Now you're both going to die.

32:58.391 --> 33:00.130
You killed
my husband.I didn't want to.

33:00.173 --> 33:03.521
I liked Angus,
more than you did, I think.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.043
But...

33:05.086 --> 33:06.956
he was a rat.And you're the worst

33:07.000 --> 33:09.347
personal assistant
I've ever known.

33:09.391 --> 33:10.391
[laughs]

33:15.478 --> 33:17.304
With you, I'll be quick.

33:17.347 --> 33:18.652
Her...

33:18.695 --> 33:21.391
I'm going to take my time.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.608
Over my dead body.

33:24.652 --> 33:26.391
I'm glad we understand
each other.

33:26.434 --> 33:28.086
And what are you
gonna do with that?

33:28.130 --> 33:30.217
Give me a paper cut?

33:30.260 --> 33:32.260
I doubt the blade is clean.

33:32.304 --> 33:35.173
Infections can be deadly.

33:35.217 --> 33:36.652
Give me that knife.

33:41.695 --> 33:44.086
This was my favorite suit.

33:44.130 --> 33:45.913
I take it back.

33:45.956 --> 33:47.826
I'm gonna take my time
with you, too.

33:47.869 --> 33:49.782
I can still save your life.

33:49.826 --> 33:52.043
[chuckling]:
Oh, yeah?

33:52.086 --> 33:53.913
There is still time.

33:53.956 --> 33:55.869
All mouth and no
trousers, this one.

33:57.521 --> 33:59.304
[groaning quietly]

34:01.956 --> 34:03.434
DUCKY:
You feeling light-headed?

34:03.478 --> 34:07.000
I just nicked
your brachial artery.

34:07.043 --> 34:09.565
You'll be dead in

34:09.608 --> 34:11.304
less than 90 seconds.

34:15.869 --> 34:17.391
I'm having trouble breathing.

34:17.434 --> 34:20.000
Yes, that would be your dying
of hypovolemic shock.

34:20.043 --> 34:24.304
The sweating and chest pains
are normal-- 70 seconds.

34:24.347 --> 34:26.347
You have to
do something.No, I don't.

34:26.391 --> 34:29.130
But if you tell me
why my best friend is dead,

34:29.173 --> 34:31.304
I'll consider it.

34:31.347 --> 34:33.086
60 seconds.

34:33.130 --> 34:35.217
[groans]
We were running

34:35.260 --> 34:37.695
a prostitution ring
out of Angus's hotel.

34:37.739 --> 34:39.304
My husband would never
let you do that.

34:39.347 --> 34:41.043
He didn't have a choice.

34:41.086 --> 34:44.347
We told him if he ratted us out,
we'd kill you.

34:44.391 --> 34:47.347
But he was a
sneaky one.

34:47.391 --> 34:49.608
Angus found out
that you were also

34:49.652 --> 34:51.956
running a smuggling ring
in the U.S.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.434
He tried to get
the evidence to me.

34:54.478 --> 34:57.217
He hoped that NCIS
would take you down.

34:57.260 --> 35:00.652
That you'd go to jail and never
know who sent you there.

35:00.695 --> 35:02.391
Angus would be free.

35:02.434 --> 35:06.130
But it didn't quite work out
that way, did it?

35:06.173 --> 35:08.869
We found his e-mail
to Colpepper.

35:08.913 --> 35:10.608
Couldn't let him talk.

35:10.652 --> 35:12.434
That's all
I know.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.217
Fix my arm already.No.

35:14.260 --> 35:17.826
No, that's not all you know.

35:17.869 --> 35:21.347
You said "we" were running
a prostitution ring.

35:21.391 --> 35:24.956
You're just an errand boy.
A gopher.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.652
Put in place
to keep an eye on Angus.

35:27.695 --> 35:30.130
So who's really in charge?

35:30.173 --> 35:33.000
Is it someone
you're willing to die for?

35:33.043 --> 35:35.304
If so,

35:35.347 --> 35:38.217
you're welcome to be my guest.

35:38.260 --> 35:40.260
[groaning, gasping quietly]

35:48.260 --> 35:49.739
Agent Gibbs,

35:49.782 --> 35:51.260
good to see
you again.

35:51.304 --> 35:53.260
May I introduce
my new partner.

35:53.304 --> 35:56.695
Mr. Kowolski finally saw
the wisdom of my offer.

35:56.739 --> 35:59.217
Hardly. The bank twisted my arm.
I had no choice.

35:59.260 --> 36:01.260
I wouldn't sign that
paper, if I were you.Nah.

36:01.304 --> 36:03.347
You don't want to be in business
with a guy like him.

36:03.391 --> 36:05.043
I beg your pardon?

36:05.086 --> 36:06.782
You're not
relocating to the U.S.--

36:06.826 --> 36:08.347
you're expanding
operations here.

36:08.391 --> 36:10.260
I... what on earth are you
talking about? That's...

36:10.304 --> 36:12.043
At first we were wondering:
what's this guy doing

36:12.086 --> 36:13.913
with an import-export
business?

36:13.956 --> 36:15.217
But then we saw
the list of chemicals

36:15.260 --> 36:17.304
your crew smuggled
off a Navy base.

36:17.347 --> 36:20.000
Yeah, we're
thinking meth.

36:20.043 --> 36:21.956
[laughter]

36:24.304 --> 36:25.434
Look at him go.

36:27.260 --> 36:28.521
[gasps]

36:36.913 --> 36:38.304
Back to square one, I guess.

36:38.347 --> 36:40.347
Sorry about that.

36:40.391 --> 36:42.260
Oh... works for me.

36:46.608 --> 36:49.217
[bells chiming]

36:53.391 --> 36:54.608
Thanks so much.

36:54.652 --> 36:56.652
Yeah, bummer about
the taxi strike.

36:58.782 --> 37:01.043
The SAC from the NCIS office

37:01.086 --> 37:03.608
is coming to take us
to Heathrow.

37:03.652 --> 37:06.608
We have about...
half hour.

37:06.652 --> 37:08.652
You want to head
back to the hotel?

37:12.173 --> 37:14.043
Ducky?

37:14.086 --> 37:15.434
Everything okay?

37:15.478 --> 37:17.130
I'm sorry, Eleanor.

37:17.173 --> 37:20.043
Uh, everything is, uh...

37:20.086 --> 37:22.478
as it must be.

37:24.478 --> 37:27.086
So how did you leave things
with Maggie?

37:27.130 --> 37:28.521
I didn't.

37:28.565 --> 37:29.956
I just left.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.043
Without saying good-bye?

37:31.086 --> 37:32.565
MAGGIE: Yes, without
saying good-bye.

37:32.608 --> 37:34.043
Living across
the pond...

37:34.086 --> 37:36.434
hasn't done much
for your manners.

37:36.478 --> 37:38.739
I'll, uh...

37:38.782 --> 37:40.086
I'll be right back.

37:40.130 --> 37:42.565
So you came
to say good-bye.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.739
Feels familiar.

37:44.782 --> 37:46.086
It shouldn't.

37:46.130 --> 37:49.521
Didn't give me
a chance last time.

37:49.565 --> 37:51.000
Or to explain.

37:51.043 --> 37:53.043
What was there to explain?

37:57.086 --> 37:59.565
[indistinct announcements
over P.A.]

37:59.608 --> 38:01.347
[distant train whistle blowing]

38:32.434 --> 38:34.869
MAN [over P.A.]: All passengers
please board immediately.

38:57.043 --> 39:01.000
It was the hardest day
of my life,

39:01.043 --> 39:05.000
choosing between the
two men that I loved.

39:06.913 --> 39:08.869
I chose wrong.

39:08.913 --> 39:11.173
No. Maggie...

39:11.217 --> 39:12.434
Angus and I were

39:12.478 --> 39:15.434
wonderful friends but...

39:15.478 --> 39:18.086
a horrible couple.

39:18.130 --> 39:22.695
By the time I realized that,
you were off to the war and...

39:22.739 --> 39:26.217
and I was committed to the role
of a good wife.

39:30.782 --> 39:33.869
I thought you hated bow ties.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.173
I do.

39:35.217 --> 39:37.478
They're impossible
to keep straight.

39:37.521 --> 39:40.173
Why are you still...?

39:47.913 --> 39:50.608
Why didn't you ever marry?

39:50.652 --> 39:54.608
You had so much love to give.

39:56.086 --> 39:59.695
A colleague
and a very good friend of mine

39:59.739 --> 40:01.913
lost his soul mate.

40:01.956 --> 40:04.826
And then he nearly wrecked
his life

40:04.869 --> 40:08.130
marrying the wrong woman
over and over,

40:08.173 --> 40:11.478
trying to find her again.

40:11.521 --> 40:14.000
I...

40:14.043 --> 40:17.521
chose to skip that part.

40:25.956 --> 40:27.913
So...

40:27.956 --> 40:29.652
now what?

40:37.086 --> 40:40.695
I don't suppose
it's good anymore.

40:42.956 --> 40:45.000
Or is it?

40:48.173 --> 40:50.652
What are you asking me?

40:50.695 --> 40:52.173
To be honest, I don't know.

40:52.217 --> 40:55.173
All I know is that
I would like to stand here

40:55.217 --> 40:57.086
with you a little longer.

40:57.130 --> 40:59.000
Next to you.

41:00.086 --> 41:02.086
And maybe...

41:02.130 --> 41:05.086
just not say anything.

41:20.217 --> 41:22.217
