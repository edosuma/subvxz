...to RAO Industries.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.107
It was Zod.

35:19.992 --> 35:24.361
Everything he said about brotherhood,
it was all a lie.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.787
Of course he's the one
who's been using Lois.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.040
I know you wanna take
your anger out on Zod.

35:29.210 --> 35:32.327
But you and I know there's something
you have to take care of ﬁrst.

35:33.464 --> 35:37.628
Until you can tell Lois
that you are the one and only Blur...

35:37.802 --> 35:42.136
...anyone with a voice modulator
and a calling plan can pretend to be you.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.182
I know what I have to do.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.388
[RINGS]

35:51.858 --> 35:52.893
Hello?

35:53.067 --> 35:55.809
CLARK [IN DISTORTED VOICE
OVER PHONE]: Lois, thank you for coming.

35:55.987 --> 36:00.071
Well, when the Blur leaves a handwritten
message, you better believe I'm there.

36:00.408 --> 36:03.696
Chalk it up to the curiosity
of a recently unemployed reporter...

36:03.870 --> 36:06.202
...but since we've been doing this
cell-to-cell...

36:06.372 --> 36:08.909
...why are we back to doing this
old-school?

36:10.960 --> 36:12.746
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
I wanted to have this conversation...

36:12.920 --> 36:14.535
...in a place that meant something to us.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.296
Oh. Sounds awfully ofﬁcial.

36:17.466 --> 36:18.797
But, hey, you're the boss.

36:18.968 --> 36:22.176
So, what's my next impossible mission?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.383
CLARK:
There won't be one, Lois.

36:24.849 --> 36:27.716
I'm sorry. This is our last conversation.

36:29.812 --> 36:32.599
Last conversation today or for a while?

36:32.773 --> 36:37.267
If you have to go back on another hiatus,
I understand. I'll be there.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.069
As in, our last talk...

36:40.239 --> 36:41.399
...forever.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.032
No.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.945
Our relationship put you at risk.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.455
I know we would do anything
to protect each other.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.790
What if one day I'm too late?

36:54.128 --> 36:57.416
But you don't understand.
I don't care about the risk.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.957
When I'm working with you,
I'm doing something good...

37:01.135 --> 37:02.591
...something right.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.469
You don't need me for that.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.598
But I do need you.
I didn't realize it until it was too late...

37:08.768 --> 37:12.056
...but this is the most important part
of my life.

37:13.648 --> 37:18.733
There must be some other part
that means more to you.

37:22.114 --> 37:26.198
When I'm with you,
it's about more than what I want...

37:26.369 --> 37:28.360
...who I want.

37:28.537 --> 37:30.949
It is something that is bigger than me.

37:34.001 --> 37:35.992
I wish things could be different, Lois.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.500
This is the only way I can protect you.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.297
I won't call again.

37:42.677 --> 37:46.670
If anyone calls claiming to be me...

37:47.556 --> 37:48.591
...don't believe them.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.849
No matter what they say or what happens,
you can't trust them.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.679
No, please.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.522
I will be watching over you.

38:03.698 --> 38:04.813
I promise.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.200
Goodbye, Lois.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.837
Goodbye.

38:54.874 --> 38:58.287
I'm glad you still came up
after what we talked about on the street.

38:59.545 --> 39:03.003
It's beautiful, Clark. Thank you.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.051
What is it, Lois?

39:12.266 --> 39:14.678
You know you can tell me anything.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.097
Can I?

39:17.855 --> 39:19.516
Then why did I lie to you?

39:22.068 --> 39:24.855
We both agreed we would keep
some things to ourselves.

39:26.238 --> 39:28.900
I have been talking to the Blur, Clark.

39:32.119 --> 39:37.409
Doing things for him, sharing things
with him that I couldn't share with you.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.372
It was probablyjust the reporter blood
in you, right?

39:44.632 --> 39:46.918
It was more than that.

39:48.552 --> 39:50.213
But we....

39:52.264 --> 39:55.472
I talked to him and it's over.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.929
He doesn't want me in his life anymore.

40:03.150 --> 40:06.483
Well, there's someone standing right here
who still does.

40:11.158 --> 40:12.318
It's okay.

40:15.663 --> 40:19.531
You don't have to be okay with it, Clark.

40:26.507 --> 40:29.874
It's not right for me
to ask that of you, Clark.

40:33.848 --> 40:36.055
He meant a lot to you, didn't he?

40:39.728 --> 40:43.016
It's not like this, with you.

40:46.318 --> 40:50.277
I wish you could understand
what it felt like to have this....

40:51.073 --> 40:52.813
A calling.

40:53.242 --> 40:57.030
A duty to people in the world.

40:59.707 --> 41:04.701
It made my feelings for you
and everything else seem....

41:05.421 --> 41:06.536
Selﬁsh.

41:07.548 --> 41:11.291
Like there's a world out there that needs
you but if you take anything from it...

41:11.469 --> 41:13.209
...it's at someone else's expense.

41:15.806 --> 41:17.967
Lois, I do understand.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.430
How?

41:25.232 --> 41:28.099
I guess, with him gone, the question is...

41:29.236 --> 41:30.976
...am I enough?

42:18.994 --> 42:20.985
