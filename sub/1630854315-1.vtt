WEBVTT

00:08.967 --> 00:10.502
$2.98.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.638
That's how much money it'll take
to buy a gallon of paint.

00:12.770 --> 00:17.275
To make the purchase, this young man's f
gives him a crisp, new $5 bill

00:17.408 --> 00:19.977
that he received at the bank yesterday.

00:23.614 --> 00:24.448
What will happen to it?

00:24.582 --> 00:26.249
What will it be used for?

00:26.383 --> 00:29.519
What can money be used for anyway?

00:29.985 --> 00:31.454
This is one of the most common ways

00:31.588 --> 00:35.124
in which we all use money
as a medium of exchange for goods.

00:35.258 --> 00:40.396
And so, the $5 bill has found its way

00:40.529 --> 00:41.362
into this cash register.

00:41.497 --> 00:42.363
But it doesn't stay long.

00:42.497 --> 00:44.666
It's going to be used to pay Mr. Kelly,

00:44.798 --> 00:51.038
an electrician, for the wiring work he h

00:52.673 --> 00:55.142
The $5 bill is moving fast.

00:55.808 --> 00:59.279
That's because it's so convenient
to use in business transactions.

00:59.680 --> 01:00.646
In fact, it's hard to imagine
a world without money.

01:01.714 --> 01:05.551
For thousands of years,
people got along fine without it.

01:06.384 --> 01:07.653
In primitive days, living was simple.

01:07.787 --> 01:11.356
A world built on trust and cooperation.

01:12.724 --> 01:16.761
Now imagine you want to keep your
transactions anonymous for personal reas

01:17.094 --> 01:19.862
If you think Big Brother should
keep his nose out of private matters,

01:19.996 --> 01:24.133
well, that's where cryptocurrency comes

01:25.101 --> 01:27.370
Digital, decentralized and hard to track

01:27.603 --> 01:29.539
And they have more in common
with gold than you'd expect.

01:30.072 --> 01:31.206
Both are mined.

01:31.340 --> 01:34.609
Gold from the ground. Crypto from comput

01:36.011 --> 01:37.512
Many people also use crypto as an altern

01:37.646 --> 01:40.214
to the money provided by their federal g

01:41.415 --> 01:43.285
If you like economic freedom,
hate middlemen and would love the chance

01:43.417 --> 01:48.289
to topple existing power structures,
then crypto might be right for you.

01:49.089 --> 01:50.857
And if you really know what you're doing
they're almost untraceable.

01:51.224 --> 01:54.127
And to no one's surprise,
a favorite of those

01:54.261 --> 01:57.530
with something to hide.

02:18.548 --> 02:21.752
Ugh!

02:21.884 --> 02:22.719
Mornin' boys.

02:22.853 --> 02:23.587
Mornin' Pops.

02:23.720 --> 02:24.520
Mornin' Dad.

02:24.653 --> 02:26.222
Where's the coffee?

02:30.024 --> 02:30.959
Thought I told you to get coffee.

02:32.627 --> 02:33.461
You didn't.

02:33.595 --> 02:36.564
You callin' me a liar?

02:36.698 --> 02:37.632
No!

02:37.766 --> 02:38.733
I'll get some before work. Okay?

02:38.867 --> 02:41.435
Pick me up some smokes, too.

02:41.770 --> 02:44.239
Dad.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.439
I ain't askin. It's my house.

02:45.572 --> 02:48.342
You want me to start chargin' you rent?

02:49.942 --> 02:53.479
Brandon, you got lunch money?

02:55.046 --> 02:56.582
I got him.

02:57.082 --> 02:59.050
Oh, yeah?

03:01.320 --> 03:02.521
That job you got must be working out, hu

03:02.654 --> 03:04.689
And they trust you?

03:09.560 --> 03:13.430
I'll be upstairs.

03:37.251 --> 03:40.086
Poor guy. Never saw it coming.

03:40.220 --> 03:44.191
Thought he was making a deal to sell
his giant stash of prescription pills.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.157
But these three gentlemen
had something else in mind.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.827
Their boss, ornery S.O.B.

03:46.959 --> 03:49.762
named Calvin, is an old timer from up no

03:50.563 --> 03:53.766
A chameleon, always looking for the next

03:53.899 --> 03:55.768
The type of guy that doesn't like
folks talking about him.

03:55.901 --> 03:59.604
And when they do, they'll be looking
at the inside of a plastic bag.

04:03.942 --> 04:09.646
It's packed.

04:16.586 --> 04:18.255
Turn it on.

04:19.489 --> 04:20.656
It's just kinda fucked up, man.

04:20.790 --> 04:21.691
Don't let him hear you say that.

04:21.824 --> 04:22.991
Calvin wants him in a bag.

04:23.124 --> 04:25.494
Do your job!

04:39.639 --> 04:41.342
...is to sell the drugs via Bitcoin

04:41.475 --> 04:43.743
to a bigger fish and then
sell that bitcoin for cash.

04:43.877 --> 04:46.713
The invisibility it can
provide is pretty appealing,

04:47.513 --> 04:48.982
except they're too stupid
to do it themselves.

04:49.114 --> 04:53.785
And that's why they partnered
with this cute couple.

04:54.887 --> 04:55.454
Babe?

05:06.330 --> 05:09.064
That is not good, man.

05:09.198 --> 05:10.534
Nope.

05:21.510 --> 05:22.945
We'll get the stuff to Calvin.

05:23.077 --> 05:27.815
He says we're on for 12:03 a.m.

05:29.517 --> 05:30.818
Okay.

05:32.453 --> 05:33.620
That's oddly specific.

05:34.721 --> 05:36.557
That's what I said, but...you know how h

05:37.189 --> 05:40.660
We'll do the handoff, and you two
will let us know when it hits the accoun

05:40.793 --> 05:45.665
Oh, uh, accounting is for banking.
Crypto uses wallets.

05:47.098 --> 05:48.934
As long as we can convert into cash...

05:49.100 --> 05:52.438
...I don't give a shit what you call it.

05:53.738 --> 05:54.306
And your guy?

05:56.508 --> 05:58.576
The...the thing is...is...um...he's...

06:00.209 --> 06:02.046
The thing is, he...um...

06:02.178 --> 06:06.483
He's...he's in. He's uh...

06:06.983 --> 06:07.984
Right? He's absolutely in.

06:08.116 --> 06:10.085
I was not in. Lou's bluffing.

06:10.219 --> 06:14.390
I mean, he's in like Flynn. This...this

06:15.057 --> 06:16.526
You got it.

06:16.658 --> 06:18.528
- Yeah. Cool, cool, cool.
- When I got out of jail.

06:18.660 --> 06:19.895
I promised myself I'd go legitimate.
Get a real job build for the future.

06:20.395 --> 06:23.164
But, as we'll find out...

06:23.298 --> 06:25.300
...old habits...

06:26.099 --> 06:26.568
...die hard.

06:27.234 --> 06:29.769
Come on, we gotta go. Get your bag.

06:31.405 --> 06:33.773
Yo, I told you, I'm not interested!

06:35.140 --> 06:35.976
Ty. Wha-

06:36.108 --> 06:41.581
Ty! Wha- No no no no!

06:45.183 --> 06:46.852
Well, babe?

06:49.388 --> 06:52.558
Well...um...

06:53.057 --> 06:53.891
He's...ugh

06:54.025 --> 06:54.691
He's not interested.

06:54.826 --> 06:57.127
Why not?

06:57.261 --> 07:00.531
Yeah, I wanted you to come by because...

07:01.865 --> 07:04.468
I had a no pay. The guy died or somethin

07:04.734 --> 07:06.436
They didn't find his body for two weeks.
That's a whole other story.

07:06.570 --> 07:10.339
Anyway, I went into the locker
and I came across this.

07:10.473 --> 07:13.275
Figured you might know something about i

07:13.409 --> 07:16.311
2080. Founders Edition.
1600 megclock. 11 gigs.

07:16.445 --> 07:17.245
It's smoking.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.251
Aren't you supposed to keep those
lockers locked until auction day?

07:24.386 --> 07:25.520
What are you, a cop?

07:25.653 --> 07:26.621
No, but you used to be.

07:26.754 --> 07:30.257
Yeah. Used to be, man. Used to be.

07:30.391 --> 07:34.159
-Is it worth something?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

07:36.429 --> 07:38.930
Can you put it on my tab?

07:39.065 --> 07:41.367
Ahh, fuck.

07:41.501 --> 07:42.267
Electric bill was astronomical this mont

07:43.669 --> 07:45.703
How much?

07:45.836 --> 07:46.505
432 bucks.

07:47.372 --> 07:50.875
I get pay next Friday and I've
been working some overtime...

07:52.343 --> 07:56.313
...and you know, all it takes is one nic
run of one of these coins to take off

07:56.447 --> 07:57.348
and I'll be set.

07:57.481 --> 07:58.915
That's what you're saying.

08:03.319 --> 08:04.953
And I mean....

08:05.087 --> 08:06.088
...with all this equipment running
your heating bill this winter

08:06.221 --> 08:08.658
will be next to nothing.

08:11.527 --> 08:14.062
This is a cryptocurrency mining r

08:14.194 --> 08:17.666
I pumped every bit of cash of earning
to building it.

08:19.033 --> 08:22.069
It's really just a bunch of graphics
cards and computer processors

08:22.203 --> 08:25.405
running math equations,
and if they do it long enough,

08:25.539 --> 08:26.073
they up their chances
to be rewarded with a token.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.941
Some of which can become quite valuable.

08:43.354 --> 08:48.192
You know, Beck, I hate tequila.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.061
You're just out of practice.

08:51.196 --> 08:52.663
Well, you can't be good at everything.

08:52.796 --> 08:56.467
I know a few things you're good at.
I know you can bend

08:56.600 --> 08:57.133
meta with your bare hands.

08:57.266 --> 08:59.569
All day.

09:00.837 --> 09:01.270
Well...

09:02.206 --> 09:02.804
You know, technically,
I have a machine to help me.

09:03.772 --> 09:07.643
Oooh! Now you're speaking my language.

09:10.278 --> 09:11.846
Oh, shit. Look what the cat dragged in.

09:11.979 --> 09:15.983
This is Dougie. Low level
criminal turned shoe entrepreneur.

09:16.117 --> 09:18.252
Tons of money in the sneaker game
these days.

09:18.385 --> 09:19.520
Anyway, when my mom died, this is the gu
that took me under his wing.

09:19.653 --> 09:21.087
Four Nordeast's?

09:21.223 --> 09:24.824
Tried and true. Quatro brews.

09:25.458 --> 09:28.094
Hey, add a couple shots for me and Ty Ty

09:29.162 --> 09:30.697
If there was a Venn diagram of crazy,
crooked and loyal.

09:30.829 --> 09:35.334
His face would be right in the middle

09:46.277 --> 09:47.010
Anything yet, anything?

09:47.144 --> 09:47.712
-No.
-No?

09:47.844 --> 09:49.279
Mm-mm.

09:49.647 --> 09:52.682
-What?
-Bam! It's your turn.

09:52.815 --> 09:54.417
-It's your turn.
-No no no. I'm doing this right now.

09:54.551 --> 09:57.220
Oh, you want your left hand? You can use

09:57.587 --> 10:01.258
-Stop, stop, stop.
-Right here. Left.

10:01.624 --> 10:02.358
No, stop, stop, stop, stop!

10:04.260 --> 10:07.028
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:08.197 --> 10:09.764
So I know this is better...

10:09.897 --> 10:12.734
Stop!

10:16.904 --> 10:21.742
Um. Babe?

10:25.144 --> 10:27.313
Sorry. What...exactly...is...

10:28.381 --> 10:30.416
Holy shit!

10:30.550 --> 10:33.151
That's holy shit? Cause I was thinking h

10:33.286 --> 10:35.487
-Oh!
That's 800 grand.

10:35.620 --> 10:40.391
Oh! That's...800...fuckin...

10:42.359 --> 10:42.993
-Oh!
-Calvin.

10:43.127 --> 10:44.628
Hey. Uh...

10:47.198 --> 10:47.931
Yes. Yes, sir.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.032
This is..the...

10:49.165 --> 10:53.503
The transfers hit the account.

10:53.636 --> 10:54.537
-Wallet.
-Motherf--

10:54.671 --> 10:56.405
-What?
-The wallet.

10:56.539 --> 10:57.940
The wallet! Whatever the transfers hit,
the thing it's supposed to hit.

10:58.073 --> 11:00.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

11:00.509 --> 11:01.410
Fuck you too, my friend! Woo!

11:05.314 --> 11:10.016
-Ha ha ha haaaa!
-Yes!

11:11.552 --> 11:12.553
You, sir...

11:12.687 --> 11:13.987
-Thank you.
-Tell me...

11:14.120 --> 11:16.856
Do you...

11:16.990 --> 11:17.490
...where'd ya go?

11:17.624 --> 11:19.593
Where'd you...

11:19.726 --> 11:21.328
We're getting chased down
this alley and like,

11:21.461 --> 11:25.764
poof! Time vanishes out of nowhere
like a fucking spider monkey.

11:25.897 --> 11:29.100
Parkours up this 12 foot wall

11:29.235 --> 11:30.703
up into an open window

11:30.836 --> 11:32.204
and I'm hearing these sirens,
and I just got to run.

11:32.338 --> 11:34.839
The kicker is,
guess whose window he climbed into?

11:35.773 --> 11:36.708
Come on, tell him.

11:37.775 --> 11:40.812
Miss Coughlin's bedroom.

11:40.944 --> 11:43.314
Like the math teacher? Yeah.

11:43.447 --> 11:44.848
What happened?

11:44.981 --> 11:46.783
She hit me with a broom
and told me to get out.

11:48.384 --> 11:50.786
That was a completely different fuckin a

11:52.356 --> 11:53.856
What did you guys take, though?

11:53.989 --> 11:56.626
Brainiac here had to get a DVD drive
for his fucking computer.

11:56.759 --> 11:57.760
Wait, wait, wait...

11:57.893 --> 12:01.763
You took the whole damn cash register,

12:02.764 --> 12:03.964
so I had to leave you!

12:04.498 --> 12:07.067
Yeah, well, I hope you enjoyed
your Rugrats DVD or whatever.

12:13.606 --> 12:14.308
Gentlemen!

12:14.440 --> 12:17.110
Come...the...

12:17.244 --> 12:19.011
...fuck in!

12:19.144 --> 12:21.079
Hey, how'd everything go?
How'd everything go?

12:21.214 --> 12:22.447
Like a dream!

12:22.581 --> 12:24.049
-Like a dream...
-You got the money, right?

12:24.183 --> 12:26.418
What're you talkin about?
Did I get the money?

12:26.652 --> 12:30.121
Only every one and zero man, ha ha ha!

12:31.756 --> 12:33.658
Yeah, you want one of these too?

12:33.791 --> 12:35.394
I told you I don't like it when you touc

12:35.526 --> 12:37.762
-You don't like when I touch you? Why wh
-Don't touch me.

12:39.596 --> 12:41.631
Calvin!

12:41.765 --> 12:42.832
Hey man, you want one of these?

12:42.965 --> 12:45.201
-Ah no.
-I didn't think so.

12:45.335 --> 12:46.969
Hey, man, listen, did you happen to hear
we...

12:47.102 --> 12:47.603
we got the money.

12:47.737 --> 12:49.505
Yeah, I heard.

12:49.638 --> 12:54.610
Okay, calm down man. Beer in the back, s

12:55.244 --> 12:55.678
So you...

12:56.211 --> 12:59.614
You Lou's new girl?

13:00.948 --> 13:03.517
I didn't know he had an old one.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.662
What the fuck are they staring at?

13:16.796 --> 13:19.030
It looks like you're about to find out.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.206
As-salamu alaykum.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.540
You're out of jail.

13:30.074 --> 13:32.243
Yeah, I am.

13:34.712 --> 13:36.313
Why didn't you come to visit us?

13:36.447 --> 13:38.816
Hey, man, maybe you can catch up on smal
talk some other time.

13:39.450 --> 13:42.719
Why don't you stay in your lane
and I'll stay in mine?

13:46.389 --> 13:48.724
Okay, well, let me tell you something.

13:48.857 --> 13:52.561
My friend here, he owes my boss some mon

13:53.462 --> 13:53.995
Okay? And I was just--

13:54.128 --> 13:54.463
Leaving?

13:54.595 --> 13:55.297
Leaving.

13:55.430 --> 13:58.499
Yeah.

14:02.770 --> 14:04.104
Have a good night.

14:07.741 --> 14:10.276
What is up with that dude?

14:12.245 --> 14:13.346
I got pinched.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.181
Some of Beam's property went down with m

14:15.315 --> 14:16.515
And the cops tried to trace it back to t

14:16.648 --> 14:18.617
Like classic cars or some shit?

14:18.751 --> 14:22.887
No. A bunch of farm equipment and a comb

14:25.324 --> 14:25.957
A combine?

14:26.858 --> 14:27.859
Yeah, like farm tractor kind of thing.

14:27.992 --> 14:31.661
Harvest corn. Really expensive.

14:34.264 --> 14:38.734
A combine??

14:43.038 --> 14:45.841
What, are you doing some farm crimes now

14:45.975 --> 14:50.612
-Keep your fucking voice down.
-Steal his bibs?

15:05.025 --> 15:08.495
'Sup Ty?

15:08.628 --> 15:09.862
I really should have seen this co

15:09.996 --> 15:11.197
You think they'd reward me for not narci

15:11.330 --> 15:15.132
but, I don't think they do too well with

15:15.600 --> 15:16.935
While you watch me get my ass kicked.

15:17.068 --> 15:20.539
You probably want to
know what my shirt means.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.139
H-O-D-L

15:22.274 --> 15:23.341
in the crypto world,
it means hold on for dear life.

15:26.076 --> 15:27.577
Whether your bitcoin is cratering
or shooting the moon

15:27.711 --> 15:31.614
you keep holding on to it, 'cause the pa

15:32.283 --> 15:32.882
That kind of advice works with old frien

15:40.523 --> 15:43.425
Hey, where ya going?

15:43.559 --> 15:44.659
Home!

15:46.462 --> 15:47.362
You're welcome!

15:57.205 --> 15:58.705
Yeah.

15:59.906 --> 16:00.607
I got beer--

16:00.740 --> 16:02.641
--gah! No no....

16:02.775 --> 16:05.911
Guys guys easy. Hey, hey!

16:06.446 --> 16:07.680
No, no, no.

16:07.813 --> 16:09.982
-Listen to me, those--mother--are
-Relax.

16:10.115 --> 16:10.983
motherfucking collectibles, man!

16:11.116 --> 16:14.286
Well, just, just, just.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.287
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, man!

16:17.021 --> 16:18.056
Back up.

16:19.324 --> 16:19.656
I...

16:20.291 --> 16:21.658
I got those straight from Japan, man.

16:21.792 --> 16:25.896
You really got a hard on for this Asian

16:26.029 --> 16:29.132
It's a fucking cool culture, man!

16:33.803 --> 16:35.404
They...they have a...

16:35.538 --> 16:36.472
Fuck, man!

16:36.606 --> 16:37.973
Ah! Oh! Wow, man. I can't watch.

16:41.511 --> 16:44.112
Hey. How's uhh...

16:44.246 --> 16:44.845
Oh, it is.

16:47.114 --> 16:48.749
It's crazy, man. Crazy.

16:49.850 --> 16:50.417
So, guess what?

16:51.352 --> 16:51.952
I bought it.

16:52.086 --> 16:53.954
The ring?

16:54.555 --> 16:58.725
She's gonna be so excited. I'm so happy

17:01.760 --> 17:02.928
You know, when I get my cut,

17:03.062 --> 17:06.331
I'm gonna take her down to some...

17:06.466 --> 17:08.967
sleepy Mexican beach town,

17:09.101 --> 17:11.969
by a little bar right on the ocean,

17:12.104 --> 17:14.705
and live out the rest of our days...

17:14.839 --> 17:18.276
drunk, stoned and happy.

17:19.943 --> 17:21.811
Hey, hey, hey.

17:21.945 --> 17:24.447
Oh, yeah, we so sorry.

17:27.417 --> 17:28.418
They don't know, yeah?

17:30.753 --> 17:31.421
No, of course not.

17:31.555 --> 17:32.955
Do not tell them.

17:33.088 --> 17:33.889
-These crazy motherfuckers--
-I know, I know, I know.

17:34.957 --> 17:37.493
I didn't tell them.

17:37.626 --> 17:38.327
Nothing they don't need to know.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.763
Why don't you fix some sake or somethin,

17:42.096 --> 17:44.332
I'll give you sake.

17:45.300 --> 17:48.268
Oh my God.

17:48.403 --> 17:48.969
What?

17:50.637 --> 17:53.373
I fucking love this song.

17:53.507 --> 17:55.908
Come on, come on, come on.

18:32.474 --> 18:34.676
-You're gonna hate me. I wanna go to bed
-Nah nah nah. You do you.

18:34.809 --> 18:35.477
Alright?

18:40.014 --> 18:42.749
Hey man. Where ya going?

18:44.051 --> 18:45.819
Talk to you tomorrow.

18:45.952 --> 18:47.455
Yeah.

19:10.308 --> 19:11.142
-Sammy.
-Hey, man.

19:11.276 --> 19:14.478
Sorry man.

20:43.457 --> 20:46.193
Just because he wanted out...

20:46.326 --> 20:52.164
...didn't mean he was automatically narc

20:52.465 --> 20:53.699
He could've made one phone call and we'd

20:53.833 --> 20:57.336
That is a speculationary guess, man.

20:58.536 --> 21:00.538
I'm not in the business of wondering.

21:00.672 --> 21:04.641
Life's too short to be looking over
your shoulder all the time.

21:11.047 --> 21:13.283
Wish you would have stayed in the bedroo

21:13.416 --> 21:15.651
Next time you wanna off someone...

21:19.087 --> 21:20.422
...give me a heads up.

21:20.922 --> 21:22.191
Well, we can't trust you, honey.

21:22.325 --> 21:26.026
Hey. Yes, you fucking can.

21:28.764 --> 21:29.930
I told you, Calvin.

21:30.064 --> 21:30.731
-She's good.
- Hey, shut up, will ya?

21:30.866 --> 21:31.699
She's good!

21:31.832 --> 21:33.368
Hey, shut the fuck up!

21:34.502 --> 21:38.071
You don't know me very well. Do you?

21:41.907 --> 21:44.744
There were five of you...

21:44.878 --> 21:48.080
And now there are four.

21:48.214 --> 21:52.551
Lew's take just increased by a whole lot

21:53.050 --> 21:54.585
I do well.

21:55.187 --> 21:57.954
Right, babe?

21:59.624 --> 22:00.056
I like it.

22:00.392 --> 22:02.993
You can help us clean up.

22:03.127 --> 22:05.196
You want to make me an accessory?

22:45.164 --> 22:47.965
Look who is sneaking in the back door.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.568
Stop, stop.

22:49.701 --> 22:54.439
Why are you all out of breath
and look at your face?

22:54.572 --> 22:55.673
What did you get yourself into?

22:55.806 --> 22:59.243
Just helping some friends.

22:59.377 --> 23:01.312
I didn't start any trouble. It found me.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.218
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.455
Dude! What the hell, it's like
4 hours past your bedtime!

23:12.855 --> 23:15.691
What? Dad said I could watch TV until I

23:16.692 --> 23:20.229
Go to bed.

23:27.268 --> 23:30.604
Why is he still up? He should be in bed.

23:30.737 --> 23:31.738
Not today, Ty. I don't need
another fucking lecture.

23:31.972 --> 23:33.540
Mom...

23:33.673 --> 23:35.842
-...would--
-Don't you bring your mother into this.

23:35.976 --> 23:39.010
She'd be disgusted.

23:40.913 --> 23:41.914
You don't know what the half...

23:42.046 --> 23:45.750
...you selfish little fuckin' punk.

23:46.651 --> 23:49.086
I don't need you squawking in
my face about how I live my life...

23:49.220 --> 23:52.757
...or how I raise my kids.

23:52.891 --> 23:54.858
Y'all still alive, aint you?

23:54.993 --> 23:57.594
Are you going to raise up on me? Hmm?

23:58.962 --> 24:01.732
You wanna hit me?

24:01.865 --> 24:03.566
Go ahead. I dare you.

24:03.699 --> 24:06.669
Pansy.

24:07.068 --> 24:09.305
I'll knock you into tomorrow.

24:09.438 --> 24:12.408
No.

24:14.976 --> 24:16.711
I'm just gonna wait until you're dead.

24:43.035 --> 24:47.172
Oh, unfortunately, I'm not at
liberty to give out those details,

24:47.306 --> 24:48.573
but I'm sure a simple background check..

24:48.706 --> 24:53.444
...will give you all the information you

24:53.577 --> 24:55.845
Yeah, you have a great day too.

25:22.736 --> 25:23.438
Ty! Hey.

25:23.571 --> 25:24.605
Yeah.

25:33.112 --> 25:37.583
Ty, you remember Roxanne from H.R.?

25:38.850 --> 25:39.385
Yeah.

25:39.684 --> 25:41.453
What is that?

25:41.820 --> 25:43.588
It's my application.

25:43.721 --> 25:44.489
Correct.

25:44.622 --> 25:46.091
What do you see in that little box

25:46.224 --> 25:49.159
where it says,
have you ever been convicted of a felony

25:49.293 --> 25:50.594
I see no.

25:54.063 --> 25:55.865
Well, H.R.

25:55.999 --> 25:58.801
got some weird phone call saying that
we should look into your criminal histor

25:58.935 --> 25:59.902
And they did.

26:01.304 --> 26:04.640
If I check yes there's no chance of me b

26:04.773 --> 26:06.008
I understand that, but this is a busines

26:06.141 --> 26:07.675
You believe in second chances, right?

26:07.809 --> 26:10.412
It says 18 months
for distribution of stolen property, tha

26:10.545 --> 26:13.582
Just give me a break.

26:13.714 --> 26:14.549
Okay, that's all.

26:14.682 --> 26:16.217
I'm sorry, but you really need to go.

26:16.350 --> 26:18.885
Yeah.

26:47.978 --> 26:48.412
Fuck!

27:06.227 --> 27:07.595
Didn't you see the sign? We're closed.

27:18.405 --> 27:24.444
I was starting to think you didn't like

27:26.446 --> 27:32.350
You may have gathered, business, it's go

27:32.484 --> 27:34.120
It sounds like it.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.655
Yeah, and nothing illegal, mind
you it's all legit, you know.

27:36.787 --> 27:38.322
Yeah.

27:38.456 --> 27:43.627
And we get a lot of people coming in her
trying to buy and sell crypto.

27:44.428 --> 27:44.994
You know.

27:45.129 --> 27:46.664
Okay.

27:46.796 --> 27:49.599
Hey, we're sitting on about 800 grand
in Bitcoin right now. Mm.

27:53.203 --> 27:55.605
What do you need from me, my friend?

27:56.405 --> 27:56.972
It's all in the Wallet?

27:57.107 --> 27:57.840
Yeah.

27:57.973 --> 27:59.475
just the drive.

27:59.608 --> 28:03.612
Public I.D. and private key.

28:03.745 --> 28:05.747
Oh, just.

28:05.880 --> 28:06.215
Well, then.

28:06.347 --> 28:08.150
Bam!

28:08.282 --> 28:11.952
That's a 2 terabyte hard drive.

28:12.086 --> 28:13.754
The data we're about to put on it

28:13.887 --> 28:15.555
could fit on an old school floppy disk,
but Lew doesn't know any better.

28:17.657 --> 28:19.593
The important thing to understand

28:19.726 --> 28:20.860
is that this drive is about to become
a briefcase full of cash.

28:22.261 --> 28:25.731
Giddy the fuck up.

28:25.864 --> 28:27.466
A really big, untraceable...

28:27.600 --> 28:28.266
This won't take long.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.033
Briefcase

28:29.168 --> 28:32.003
Jess!

28:32.303 --> 28:33.904
This is a dual LTE router.

28:34.037 --> 28:35.440
But okay.

28:35.573 --> 28:37.775
It accepts two different
SIM cards at the same time,

28:37.908 --> 28:40.310
which means it connects in two different
cell companies at the same time.

28:41.112 --> 28:41.978
You using a VPN, yeah?

28:43.347 --> 28:44.981
I ain't telling you.

28:45.115 --> 28:47.483
Why not?

28:47.617 --> 28:49.086
-Just not going to tell you.
-It's the reason I get paid and you don'

28:49.219 --> 28:51.887
Oh. Oh, that

28:52.854 --> 28:53.321
easy, easy.

28:53.456 --> 28:54.489
Okay. Okay.

28:54.624 --> 28:56.358
Go to your... kids go to your corners.

28:56.491 --> 28:57.726
Continue.

28:57.858 --> 29:01.929
Explain... explain the tumbler

29:02.063 --> 29:03.698
Tumbler thingy.

29:03.831 --> 29:06.800
tumbling is a system that allows us to m
your coins with others,

29:08.270 --> 29:10.336
making it impossible
to know what transaction led to

29:10.471 --> 29:11.138
who or what. It's like

29:11.272 --> 29:16.110
if 50 people

29:16.743 --> 29:18.043
put a thousand pennies in a bag,
shook it up,

29:20.280 --> 29:23.715
and then everyone took out
a random group of pennies.

29:24.016 --> 29:27.119
Right, so then you knew you wouldn't kno

29:27.252 --> 29:28.352
Pretty much impossible to know.

29:28.486 --> 29:30.055
Yeah. Bam, well said.

29:30.189 --> 29:34.024
Can I see you outside?

29:37.427 --> 29:38.895
Good luck.

29:40.164 --> 29:40.830
Yeah.

29:40.963 --> 29:43.266
Yeah, he's fine.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.101
I've used him like uhh you know

29:45.235 --> 29:46.969
a dozen times before.

29:47.103 --> 29:49.904
Nothing this big.

29:51.440 --> 29:52.474
Well,

29:52.608 --> 29:56.978
I mean, that is not incorrect, but...

29:58.780 --> 29:59.447
Don't say I didn't warn you.

29:59.581 --> 30:01.415
Oh, hey hey.

30:02.983 --> 30:03.318
Listen.

30:03.450 --> 30:07.255
we will.

30:07.387 --> 30:10.724
We will make sure the money's there and
double check everything and if it's not

30:10.857 --> 30:15.628
we'll just take care of it. Ok?

30:18.497 --> 30:19.030
Done!

30:19.865 --> 30:21.032
I'm done.

30:26.971 --> 30:29.807
what, what, what, what, what, what, what

30:31.076 --> 30:32.476
There's a new wallet.

30:32.610 --> 30:34.044
And there's your balance.

30:34.178 --> 30:36.680
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa that!

30:36.814 --> 30:40.683
that is that that is my new.

30:42.785 --> 30:43.686
You're looking at where
I'm looking that.

30:43.820 --> 30:45.188
You're a rich man Lew.

30:45.321 --> 30:47.422
Bitcoin is going up you better cash

30:47.556 --> 30:51.893
-Oh right yes there is this so we're goo
-Yup. It's all on that drive. Don't lose

30:52.594 --> 30:56.631
Keep it safe.

30:58.300 --> 31:02.103
Uh, and the thing is

31:05.072 --> 31:08.908
it's all there plus there's a little ext

31:12.379 --> 31:13.945
Yeah, yeah! Hey!

31:14.080 --> 31:15.781
Thanks Lew.

31:15.914 --> 31:20.952
Who here is up for a p-a-r-t to the y?

31:21.086 --> 31:22.420
Come on.

31:22.553 --> 31:23.621
Does this not deserve a party?!

31:23.755 --> 31:27.892
Does this not deserve a... ow... party?!

31:30.361 --> 31:33.230
Yo.

31:33.364 --> 31:36.666
Hey.

31:40.304 --> 31:41.837
Where's Lew?

31:47.410 --> 31:50.978
I'm free

31:54.782 --> 31:55.516
to say no, no, no, it's a second chance.

31:57.252 --> 32:01.155
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see

32:02.222 --> 32:05.692
I'm free from sadness, everyday is a sec

32:06.592 --> 32:07.293
listen to me.

32:07.527 --> 32:08.460
I just got out of prison

32:09.962 --> 32:13.532
and I live at home with my dad
and my brother.

32:14.466 --> 32:18.070
And yesterday I lost the best job

32:19.470 --> 32:21.340
I've ever had.

32:22.307 --> 32:22.973
What's funny?

32:23.107 --> 32:23.741
Sorry.

32:23.874 --> 32:24.775
Morbid sense of humor.

32:26.143 --> 32:27.178
You're up.

32:30.414 --> 32:33.550
Okay.

32:33.683 --> 32:35.017
Ahhhhh.

32:36.920 --> 32:38.587
Bounced around some foster homes
after my brother died.

32:39.655 --> 32:42.191
Um, finished high school,

32:43.591 --> 32:45.260
got in trouble in the oil fields.

32:45.394 --> 32:49.230
And I'm dating
someone 20 years older than me now.

32:50.298 --> 32:52.200
Well, then, I guess

32:52.333 --> 32:54.068
I'll call it a draw.

32:54.701 --> 32:56.703
Hey!

33:02.908 --> 33:07.613
You guys are my two favorite people.

33:07.747 --> 33:08.981
I'm getting up there.

33:09.115 --> 33:11.384
No, no, no, not again, not again,

33:11.516 --> 33:12.151
Not again!

33:12.485 --> 33:13.952
Okay, come here.

33:14.085 --> 33:15.488
-Come here, come here, come here.
-You're so strong Lew.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.321
When did you get so strong?

33:16.454 --> 33:19.723
Oh, yeah.

33:20.125 --> 33:20.724
Oh, man.

33:20.858 --> 33:21.792
That's right baby.

33:21.925 --> 33:24.628
I love you. I love you too.

33:24.762 --> 33:25.429
No, no, no, no

33:39.375 --> 33:42.310
Come on let's go dance.

33:42.444 --> 33:43.945
Nah, not really my style.

33:44.545 --> 33:46.314
Loser?

33:48.749 --> 33:50.384
Bussy?

33:50.518 --> 33:51.218
Noooo.

33:51.352 --> 33:51.852
Yeaaaah.

33:53.154 --> 33:53.586
What?

33:53.720 --> 33:54.321
Yes.

33:54.455 --> 33:55.489
No.

33:55.622 --> 33:56.289
Really you don't dance? Come on.

33:56.424 --> 33:57.290
You're mean.

33:57.424 --> 33:58.358
Come on, come on.

33:58.491 --> 33:59.926
I'm less mean if you dance.

34:10.868 --> 34:12.170
Yeah, I'm actually gonna... I'm gonna he

34:12.304 --> 34:13.971
Oh, what? What?

34:14.105 --> 34:19.110
I'll see you in the next one.

34:19.243 --> 34:20.010
Yeah.

35:09.687 --> 35:13.791
What Is this boy doing? Hmm?

36:02.233 --> 36:04.669
Hello?

36:04.802 --> 36:07.438
Hey, Ty.

36:13.510 --> 36:15.345
Yeah, you okay.

36:19.815 --> 36:20.584
Where's Dad?

36:20.716 --> 36:21.984
Sleeping.

36:27.557 --> 36:28.790
Who are you?

36:28.924 --> 36:32.460
I'm a guy looking for his stuff.

36:33.595 --> 36:35.163
Sorry I don't  do riddles.

36:36.565 --> 36:36.997
I have to go to school.

36:38.232 --> 36:39.533
Your brother and I'll drop you o

36:39.667 --> 36:43.370
I'm sorry I don't know who you think...

36:46.140 --> 36:50.144
You see, Lew told me we had a fe

36:53.479 --> 36:57.249
He was wrong.

36:58.617 --> 37:01.919
Come on, let's get you to school.

37:09.193 --> 37:13.064
We'll be fine, B. Just go to school and

37:13.197 --> 37:15.398
I still need lunch money.

37:15.532 --> 37:16.732
Yeah.

37:19.469 --> 37:22.038
I want to thank you
for letting me eat with you this morning

37:23.206 --> 37:26.941
Get yourself an extra chocolate milk on

37:50.029 --> 37:51.830
Keep goin!

37:55.201 --> 37:56.235
Lew?

38:09.046 --> 38:10.947
What the fuck, Calvin?!

38:12.049 --> 38:14.018
Fuck!

38:14.517 --> 38:17.453
Fuck!

38:18.221 --> 38:19.756
No, no, no, no no!

38:19.888 --> 38:22.058
Please, please, please, please!

38:22.191 --> 38:24.859
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:24.993 --> 38:25.661
Lew, lew!

38:29.064 --> 38:31.599
Guys! If he knows where it is we need hi

38:50.616 --> 38:53.518
Yes, yes, yeah.

38:53.652 --> 38:54.352
Come on.

38:54.485 --> 38:57.089
Fuck you!

38:57.222 --> 38:58.022
Get him up assholes!

39:09.800 --> 39:13.336
I don't like repeating myself, so
I'm not going to ask this more than once

39:14.603 --> 39:15.037
Where's the hard drive?

39:15.705 --> 39:16.905
Lew! What the fuck is happening?!

39:17.039 --> 39:22.510
Listen man, a lot of that money was

39:23.345 --> 39:24.079
Theirs

39:24.212 --> 39:25.146
I don't, I still don't know.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.781
When you came in, just now,

39:26.914 --> 39:29.616
Did you happen to notice the front door

39:29.750 --> 39:33.187
smashed the fuck in?!

39:36.090 --> 39:36.489
No.

39:36.889 --> 39:37.690
No. Anyone?

39:37.824 --> 39:38.658
Fucking tell me!

39:38.791 --> 39:40.126
No of course not!

39:40.260 --> 39:42.261
You know I wouldn't! You paid me, we

39:42.394 --> 39:43.763
Last night!

39:43.895 --> 39:45.931
Three fucking guys in Masks 3:14 a.m.

39:46.065 --> 39:49.335
I get them. They broke in 3:14 a.m.

39:49.468 --> 39:53.504
and, and so you know, I can't help fucki

39:53.637 --> 39:55.972
Three guys right?

39:56.108 --> 39:56.774
With Masks.

39:56.906 --> 39:57.842
Three guys, huh.

39:57.974 --> 39:59.409
One, two, three.

39:59.543 --> 40:03.013
Hey whoa whoa!

40:03.147 --> 40:04.148
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:04.281 --> 40:05.216
We don't have time for this!

40:05.349 --> 40:07.584
I.... just... fucking.

40:07.717 --> 40:09.285
What this...

40:09.918 --> 40:12.288
gentleman asshole is trying to say

40:15.124 --> 40:16.457
the thing is

40:16.592 --> 40:21.363
fucking bitcoin
jumped 20% last night, man.

40:22.730 --> 40:25.899
That's 23% now.

40:26.033 --> 40:27.068
How high could this go?

40:27.201 --> 40:28.202
I'd be more worried about it dropping.

40:28.336 --> 40:30.138
How low?

40:32.072 --> 40:33.373
So we could lose everything?

40:33.507 --> 40:35.342
Yeah, I told you
we should have done this in cash.

40:35.474 --> 40:36.442
All right, all right. Last chance.

40:36.575 --> 40:37.077
Where's the drive?

40:37.210 --> 40:38.844
I don't know.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.746
I swear to god I don't know.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.914
What's happening?

40:43.048 --> 40:44.916
For fuck's sake.

40:45.050 --> 40:48.153
Whoa, whoa. What's, what, what?

40:50.221 --> 40:52.857
You got a least favorite toe?!

40:53.024 --> 40:53.857
What the fuck?

40:53.992 --> 40:55.559
Whoa whoa whoa!!

40:55.692 --> 40:57.060
Lew, Lew, Lew, please,
please, please, please, please.

41:00.530 --> 41:01.165
Fuck!

41:04.033 --> 41:04.700
No!

41:04.834 --> 41:05.768
Nine more to go.

41:05.902 --> 41:07.336
And after that, I know where

41:07.469 --> 41:11.340
your little brother lives
and where he goes to school.

41:11.740 --> 41:13.508
Lew!

41:13.642 --> 41:14.942
Fucking Calvin!

41:15.076 --> 41:16.211
I told you he didn't fucking do it!

41:16.344 --> 41:18.346
Would you lose a tow for 800 gra

41:19.980 --> 41:22.149
He's no good to us

41:22.283 --> 41:24.618
If he bleeds out man.

41:24.752 --> 41:26.887
Don't worry about it.
Fergie here is a medic in the Army.

41:27.021 --> 41:30.291
He'll be sure our friend
doesn't spend any time in the hospital.

41:32.692 --> 41:33.693
From now on.

41:33.827 --> 41:35.261
You're guilty until proven innocent.

41:35.395 --> 41:38.963
I don't care how you do it,
but I need that money.

41:40.065 --> 41:43.801
The money was the drive
without those keys it doesn't fucking ex

41:43.936 --> 41:46.205
You guys hired me to make it
untraceable and that's what I did!

41:46.871 --> 41:48.072
We, this is...

41:48.306 --> 41:49.307
we just need you
to get your ass out there and

41:51.876 --> 41:53.477
find the fuckers who did it man!

41:53.610 --> 41:55.979
I'm sorry about the fucking,
but just get the fuck out there

41:57.047 --> 41:57.914
and find who took it!

41:58.048 --> 42:00.016
Can you just do...

42:00.150 --> 42:03.118
... ah fuuuuck!

42:12.126 --> 42:13.261
Stop, stop!

42:14.195 --> 42:16.831
Stop!

42:16.966 --> 42:19.467
I cannot believe you
let that fucking animal do that to him.

42:32.912 --> 42:33.379
What?

42:33.745 --> 42:37.416
Give it to me.

42:37.549 --> 42:38.451
Why?

42:39.718 --> 42:41.619
Just give it to me.

42:41.753 --> 42:44.822
I gotta rule you out.

42:44.955 --> 42:45.623
You gotta be kidding me.

42:45.756 --> 42:46.324
I'm not kidding.

42:46.458 --> 42:48.459
Fine.

42:56.032 --> 42:56.466
The only two numbers you've called...

42:57.233 --> 42:59.701
are me and the pizza place two days ago?

43:02.571 --> 43:05.207
Who do you want me to talk to?

43:21.956 --> 43:24.257
Ow! Damn!

43:25.392 --> 43:28.261
Would I lose a tow for 800 grand?

43:29.828 --> 43:30.530
Damn right I would.

43:30.663 --> 43:31.497
But it wasn't me.

43:31.629 --> 43:33.332
And now I'm faced with a big decision.

43:33.465 --> 43:36.734
I can limp off into the shadows
and disappear.

43:37.403 --> 43:38.870
But they know where my family lives.

43:39.004 --> 43:41.040
I could call the cops and well,
that wouldn't work.

43:41.172 --> 43:45.510
Or I could put an ear to the ground and
try to find a hard drive in a haystack.

43:45.642 --> 43:48.512
The good news is that almost
everyone has a hustle these days.

43:48.644 --> 43:50.646
Won't hurt to roll the dice.

43:54.551 --> 43:55.485
Hey, Andy good to see you.

43:57.153 --> 43:59.654
Shouldn't be talking to you.

43:59.788 --> 44:00.822
Why?

44:02.992 --> 44:04.092
You went away.

44:04.225 --> 44:05.160
A lot of people started getting picked u

44:05.293 --> 44:06.127
Everyone thinks you flipped.

44:06.261 --> 44:08.129
Nah, Andy that wasn't me.

44:10.898 --> 44:11.632
You alright?

44:11.765 --> 44:13.133
Yeah, I'm Fine.

44:14.201 --> 44:14.667
Okay.

44:16.337 --> 44:20.406
I got hired to find something.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.241
A hard drive. Hear anything?

44:22.608 --> 44:27.613
Dude, 90% of my gig is buying copper
off meth heads.

44:27.746 --> 44:30.716
No one bringing me computer peripherals.

44:34.885 --> 44:37.321
Crew did a job last night.

44:37.455 --> 44:40.824
You hear of anything going down?

44:40.959 --> 44:42.593
Look, I don't want the stench of
your backstabbing ass near me.

44:42.726 --> 44:45.463
I don't know who started that rumor,
but it ain't true.

44:45.596 --> 44:48.764
Why don't you go ask Beam?

44:50.001 --> 44:51.601
Scared, huh?

44:51.734 --> 44:53.503
I would be too.

44:56.271 --> 44:57.373
You know that moment

44:57.506 --> 44:58.540
when you know you're about to get bad ne

44:58.673 --> 45:00.708
and there's really no way to avoid it?

45:00.842 --> 45:02.744
Your stomach is all balled up in a tight
and you just want to turn invisible.

45:05.047 --> 45:06.447
This is that moment.

45:06.581 --> 45:09.617
But, instead of bad news
probably get my ass kicked.

45:09.750 --> 45:10.084
Again.

45:10.418 --> 45:13.054
Mom always said

45:13.186 --> 45:15.522
the only way through it is through it.

46:05.966 --> 46:07.001
I guess you guys are washing
your white hoods, huh?

46:07.135 --> 46:08.201
Ty, I'm not a racist.

46:08.335 --> 46:09.470
I'm a capitalist.

46:09.603 --> 46:14.374
Didn't know there was much of a differen

46:15.241 --> 46:18.444
Of course.

46:27.152 --> 46:28.687
Hey Beam.

46:29.487 --> 46:30.421
Good to see you.

46:32.256 --> 46:33.458
Great to see you, too.

46:34.492 --> 46:35.593
You got out early.

46:35.726 --> 46:36.661
Yeah. Good behavior. Good behavior, righ

46:36.793 --> 46:37.727
Good behavior, right?

46:38.096 --> 46:39.463
Of course.

46:46.535 --> 46:49.206
You lost something of mine.

46:49.505 --> 46:53.308
You know that wasn't my fault.

46:53.441 --> 46:56.311
Oh, you hear that?

46:57.312 --> 47:00.448
It wasn't his fault.

47:01.415 --> 47:03.417
Rumor

47:06.753 --> 47:09.288
is that you flipped on some people.

47:15.495 --> 47:16.895
Yeah, I tried ratting you out,

47:17.029 --> 47:19.966
but said they're only interested
in legitimate criminals.

47:23.435 --> 47:26.871
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

47:44.686 --> 47:47.956
So in your current position.

47:49.458 --> 47:50.425
Would you now say

47:50.559 --> 47:54.861
I'm not a legitimate criminal?

48:04.071 --> 48:06.773
Ty.

48:12.279 --> 48:12.711
I'm the guy that started the rumor.

48:17.149 --> 48:19.118
Why would he do that?!

48:19.251 --> 48:21.619
Because I have a reputation to uphold.

48:23.887 --> 48:26.523
And the more people think you're full of

48:26.657 --> 48:28.126
The less they're going to believe

48:28.259 --> 48:29.459
that comes out of your mouth.
That was a big score.

48:29.593 --> 48:30.794
You lost for us. For all of us.

48:30.928 --> 48:32.362
A lot of moving parts! Right fellas?

48:32.496 --> 48:35.398
It almost,

48:36.300 --> 48:37.866
almost took us down

48:39.635 --> 48:40.169
You went to jail.

48:40.304 --> 48:41.903
Boo hoo!

48:42.038 --> 48:42.571
Wah wah.

48:42.705 --> 48:43.739
Now you're out.

48:43.872 --> 48:45.074
Can you focus on the present, please?

48:45.208 --> 48:45.974
Things are great, blue skies ahead.

48:46.108 --> 48:48.009
Why are you here?

48:51.246 --> 48:52.913
You know Lew from West Side Pawn?

48:56.717 --> 48:59.086
Someone stole a hard drive from him.

48:59.220 --> 48:59.787
He wants it back and he'll pay well.

49:03.356 --> 49:05.458
Hard drive.

49:07.392 --> 49:08.328
You hear that, fellas?

49:08.460 --> 49:10.063
Someone stole a hard drive.

49:10.196 --> 49:14.366
Do I look like the kind of guy
who would steal a hard drive?

49:14.499 --> 49:17.002
You'd steal air from a balloon Beam.

49:21.839 --> 49:22.974
This guy.

49:23.107 --> 49:24.875
Hard drive.

49:28.411 --> 49:30.013
So it must be important.

49:31.181 --> 49:32.249
I wonder what's on it.

49:32.381 --> 49:36.052
Dick pics.

49:36.186 --> 49:39.221
He's got a big collection.

49:41.090 --> 49:45.194
Dick pics! These guys know all about dic

49:45.327 --> 49:46.661
You should talk to their wives.

49:49.364 --> 49:50.064
Ty...

49:50.198 --> 49:53.900
I don't know.

49:54.534 --> 49:55.569
I don't know.

49:57.871 --> 50:02.209
what's on your hard drive,

50:02.508 --> 50:05.778
but I do know you've been talking to Dou

50:06.579 --> 50:09.115
I wouldn't say we're...

50:17.956 --> 50:19.556
Get out of here.

50:38.573 --> 50:39.541
Yo babe I'm gonna go for a smoke, yeah.

50:39.675 --> 50:42.476
I... I thought you quit.

50:42.610 --> 50:47.114
I thought I did, too, but
after all that shit, you know, just one.

50:47.248 --> 50:48.416
I'll be right back.

50:48.549 --> 50:50.952
Love you. Bye.

50:56.489 --> 50:57.357
This is Jess.

50:57.489 --> 51:00.960
Where the fuck are you?

51:01.094 --> 51:01.694
Please call me back on this number.

51:24.547 --> 51:26.049
Yo... ah.

51:28.184 --> 51:29.819
I got an APB on a missing hard drive.

51:32.554 --> 51:34.090
Yeah, yeah I know.

51:37.393 --> 51:38.159
I know.

51:38.493 --> 51:41.162
No, not a computer

51:41.296 --> 51:41.829
just an external drive.

52:04.149 --> 52:05.952
Ah, he was so funny.
When he was a little boy

52:06.084 --> 52:09.720
two years old, he would be running
around this house butt naked.

52:09.854 --> 52:12.023
-No, ha!
-With his little willy out.

52:15.026 --> 52:18.195
and I tell his mother, put a damn diaper

52:18.329 --> 52:20.663
people looking in the window, think we'r

52:20.797 --> 52:21.765
Like the little picture right there.

52:21.899 --> 52:25.135
Yeah, yeah, just on and on again.

52:26.503 --> 52:28.137
Oh, there he is.

52:31.340 --> 52:32.640
What's going on?

52:32.774 --> 52:35.310
Your friend came to see you,
and I told her

52:35.444 --> 52:36.644
that she had to sit down with me
a minute before I called you down.

52:36.778 --> 52:38.179
Okay, what's up?

52:38.312 --> 52:40.747
Your dad's
just been telling me some fun stories.

52:43.151 --> 52:46.988
I told them I was from up north,
and he used to drive to Sturgis every ye

52:47.120 --> 52:48.055
with his crew.

52:48.188 --> 52:49.356
Yeah, back when he was a big, bad biker

52:49.489 --> 52:51.824
Thta's right? Don't you forget it.

52:51.958 --> 52:53.659
You were in a biker gang.

52:53.793 --> 52:56.395
It wasn't a gang per se, just a bunch of
criminals and assholes cutting up.

52:56.529 --> 52:57.363
Y'all still friends?

52:57.496 --> 52:58.164
Oh yeah, ride or die

52:58.297 --> 53:01.800
to the very end.

53:03.101 --> 53:05.736
All right, enough reminiscing.

53:05.870 --> 53:07.738
I'm a head upstairs and,

53:07.972 --> 53:09.541
you know, leave you guys to it.

53:09.673 --> 53:10.641
I don't want to disturb you.

53:10.774 --> 53:14.913
You're not disturbing nothing.

53:15.711 --> 53:18.449
Boy, can't teach you nothin.

53:18.581 --> 53:19.550
Good night kids.

53:19.682 --> 53:20.483
Good night, sir. Nice meeting you.

53:20.616 --> 53:23.652
Good night pops.

53:26.456 --> 53:28.757
What are you doing here?

53:28.891 --> 53:31.060
Lew, they told me to check in on you.

53:31.193 --> 53:31.826
That could have happened with a phone ca

53:32.860 --> 53:36.097
Can we talk somewhere more private?

53:36.230 --> 53:36.764
Like?

53:36.898 --> 53:38.900
Hmm. Bedroom?

53:39.034 --> 53:39.968
You want to go to my bedroom?

53:52.912 --> 53:56.049
Yo, you mind if I, uh?

54:12.395 --> 54:13.863
Yo, this is crap wead.

54:15.365 --> 54:15.966
You should, uh...

54:17.000 --> 54:20.635
roll some of this up.

54:28.776 --> 54:30.777
Right?

54:31.913 --> 54:35.083
You were right.

54:36.283 --> 54:38.086
Cheers.

54:39.586 --> 54:41.288
Wait till that PCP hits man.

54:41.421 --> 54:44.357
What?

54:44.490 --> 54:45.224
You laced this with PCP?!

54:47.627 --> 54:48.995
Fucking with you.

54:51.564 --> 54:52.064
Oh right.

54:52.197 --> 54:53.698
um

54:53.832 --> 54:55.866
I got you, ah....

54:56.201 --> 54:59.337
Lew's antibiotics from his last hernia.

55:00.572 --> 55:01.305
Should make you feel better.

55:11.414 --> 55:12.748
Why are you here?

55:12.882 --> 55:17.352
I wanted to know more
about your investigation.

55:27.996 --> 55:32.466
Can I ask you about your brother?

55:34.234 --> 55:34.401
Try me.

55:39.005 --> 55:43.309
He was jockeying
pills, crack, meth, whatever.

55:43.842 --> 55:46.378
For this, uhm...

55:46.844 --> 55:47.313
dealer.

55:49.515 --> 55:52.051
Anyway, he got hooked on this shit
pretty bad.

55:54.119 --> 55:55.120
And ah, he was showing me

55:55.253 --> 55:59.790
this sweet car he just bought.

55:59.924 --> 56:01.258
And he told me he was going away.

56:01.391 --> 56:03.961
You know, leaving, straighten things out

56:04.895 --> 56:07.431
He was going to come back.

56:09.432 --> 56:12.135
Next thing I knew,
some trucker found him dead in a ditch.

56:12.268 --> 56:14.503
They ever catch who did it?

56:15.770 --> 56:16.404
No.

56:22.510 --> 56:25.180
Yeah.

56:27.715 --> 56:30.251
Yeah, but he disappeared.

56:39.158 --> 56:41.293
I'm really sorrry, dude.

57:31.271 --> 57:33.206
You think you could find it?

57:35.441 --> 57:36.876
No.

57:37.009 --> 57:37.910
But you're gonna try?

57:43.249 --> 57:45.184
Do I need to take you somewhere or....

57:47.018 --> 57:48.720
-Drop you off.
-I'm going wherever you're going.

57:48.853 --> 57:50.021
That's the deal.

57:50.155 --> 57:52.057
That is not the deal.

57:56.093 --> 57:57.661
This place deals
with all the stolen stuff?

57:57.795 --> 57:59.462
Let's just say Kip doesn't
have security cameras for a reason.

57:59.595 --> 58:02.365
He used to be a cop. Retired early
and bought this place.

58:05.201 --> 58:09.005
As long as no one is cookin meth he'll r

58:09.305 --> 58:11.973
You ever heard of search and seiz
Qualified immunity?

58:14.109 --> 58:16.577
Body cams
that don't work? Cops driving Mercedes?

58:18.280 --> 58:20.548
Storage facility owners
who turn a blind eye when crooked cops

58:20.681 --> 58:23.884
want to store stolen goods in a secure,
unmonitored locker?

58:24.018 --> 58:24.584
No?

58:24.719 --> 58:25.385
Okay.

58:40.799 --> 58:41.599
She's just a friend.

58:41.734 --> 58:44.036
Girlfriend material?

59:03.119 --> 59:04.620
any jobs getting pulled the other night?

59:04.754 --> 59:08.357
-Did anybody stash anything?
-What are you looking for?

59:08.490 --> 59:08.991
A hard drive.

59:11.293 --> 59:13.995
Nobody's
looking for me to store a hard drive.

59:15.529 --> 59:16.297
Yeah, but.

59:16.430 --> 59:17.398
You got an ear to the ground.

59:19.566 --> 59:23.403
You got yourself
mixed up in some shit again, don't you?

59:29.375 --> 59:30.309
I gotta get up front.

59:53.930 --> 59:54.597
You good?

59:54.731 --> 59:57.533
Yeah, uhm...

59:57.666 --> 59:58.534
I'll be right in there.

59:58.667 --> 59:59.668
Yeah.

1:00:00.602 --> 1:00:05.040
-I told ya, I don't know who you're look
-Come on, just help us out here.

1:00:05.174 --> 1:00:07.642
Where's Jess?

1:00:07.775 --> 1:00:10.077
I'm good. How are you?

1:00:10.211 --> 1:00:11.712
Cut the shit.

1:00:13.147 --> 1:00:13.849
Lew's lookin for her.

1:00:13.981 --> 1:00:14.681
Where is she?

1:00:14.816 --> 1:00:16.184
She's over there.

1:00:22.022 --> 1:00:24.925
Yo Jess!

1:00:25.058 --> 1:00:26.058
Jess!

1:00:28.395 --> 1:00:30.229
She took my truck, Kip!

1:00:35.935 --> 1:00:36.468
Not girlfriend material.

1:00:36.601 --> 1:00:39.636
No.

1:00:40.972 --> 1:00:42.506
It's cute.

1:00:42.639 --> 1:00:43.006
Cute?

1:00:46.810 --> 1:00:48.312
Mom's Mazda was cute.

1:00:48.947 --> 1:00:49.712
This.

1:00:51.882 --> 1:00:54.116
This thing screams.

1:00:54.250 --> 1:00:55.051
Step inside.

1:01:04.192 --> 1:01:05.126
Looks like mom's car.

1:01:05.260 --> 1:01:07.362
Different universe.

1:01:12.499 --> 1:01:13.835
Where'd you get the money for this?

1:01:13.969 --> 1:01:18.104
Remember that guy Calvin I told you abou

1:02:07.814 --> 1:02:09.616
What are you doing here?

1:02:10.885 --> 1:02:11.685
I figured I'd find you here.

1:02:11.818 --> 1:02:12.786
You stole my truck.

1:02:12.921 --> 1:02:15.455
It's in the garage alright. Sorry.

1:02:17.024 --> 1:02:18.959
I Freaked out.

1:02:19.091 --> 1:02:21.660
-Maybe I should call Lew. Let him know I
-Wait. Stop, please. Please.

1:02:27.098 --> 1:02:28.000
Why'd you freak out?

1:02:28.133 --> 1:02:31.136
I can't say,

1:02:31.269 --> 1:02:35.706
but it's bad.

1:02:38.342 --> 1:02:41.578
Why don't you go to the police?

1:02:53.155 --> 1:02:54.389
What did you do?

1:02:54.523 --> 1:02:59.428
I'm supposed to trust you?

1:03:09.336 --> 1:03:11.104
I hired someone

1:03:11.438 --> 1:03:13.540
to steal the drive.

1:03:38.062 --> 1:03:39.429
Who'd you hire to steal the drive?

1:03:39.563 --> 1:03:42.698
I asked a friend to hire someone for me.

1:03:43.132 --> 1:03:46.970
You know, keep my distance.

1:03:47.104 --> 1:03:48.504
I thought I was being smart.

1:03:48.637 --> 1:03:49.839
Let me guess, your friend paid them
with your money

1:03:51.007 --> 1:03:52.041
they stole the drive

1:03:52.173 --> 1:03:53.109
and you haven't heard from them since.

1:03:53.241 --> 1:03:54.909
I've called her a million times.

1:03:55.044 --> 1:03:57.312
Do you know where we can find her.

1:04:01.281 --> 1:04:02.649
A few guesses.

1:05:18.050 --> 1:05:19.384
Look, I don't know what happened.

1:05:19.517 --> 1:05:20.251
They were supposed to drop it off
after the job.

1:05:20.385 --> 1:05:22.921
Who's they?

1:05:31.161 --> 1:05:32.029
We need that drive.

1:05:32.162 --> 1:05:32.729
Our life depends on it.

1:05:32.863 --> 1:05:34.397
Okay?

1:05:34.664 --> 1:05:36.632
Some guy named Dougie.

1:05:37.433 --> 1:05:38.501
When was the last time you spoke to him?

1:05:38.634 --> 1:05:40.402
Give me his number. I'll do this mys...

1:05:42.071 --> 1:05:42.972
What?

1:05:45.108 --> 1:05:46.575
Where are you going?

1:05:53.981 --> 1:05:54.582
Come on, Dougie.

1:05:59.987 --> 1:06:00.653
Yo!

1:06:03.190 --> 1:06:05.290
Give me a second.

1:06:13.065 --> 1:06:13.899
Fergie, over there!

1:06:31.848 --> 1:06:32.649
Holy shit!

1:06:33.083 --> 1:06:34.217
Why didn't you just ring
the doorbell?

1:06:35.451 --> 1:06:39.021
Somebody turn that shit down.

1:06:41.389 --> 1:06:43.491
You really put a licking on that dude.

1:06:43.625 --> 1:06:47.095
All right, I need the drive. I'm
the one that paid for you guys to get it

1:06:47.361 --> 1:06:48.096
Where the hell is it?

1:06:48.229 --> 1:06:48.897
Where's what?

1:06:49.030 --> 1:06:50.131
The drive?

1:06:50.265 --> 1:06:50.865
Oh, the hard drive?

1:06:53.268 --> 1:06:53.867
It's in the bag.

1:06:54.368 --> 1:06:56.236
Y'all left it sitting in here?

1:06:56.369 --> 1:06:58.704
Yeah. Shit got weird.

1:06:58.839 --> 1:07:00.240
We bailed for a couple of days.
Everything's fine.

1:07:00.373 --> 1:07:01.407
No one's looking for it here.

1:07:01.541 --> 1:07:04.777
So, you got the rest of my money then.

1:07:07.312 --> 1:07:08.147
I gave everything to Cua up front.

1:07:08.281 --> 1:07:10.415
And then she gave me 75%.

1:07:10.549 --> 1:07:13.985
The last 25% is due on delivery so...

1:07:14.119 --> 1:07:15.153
She's got it.
That has nothing to do with me, man.

1:07:15.287 --> 1:07:17.588
Oh, but it is.

1:07:17.721 --> 1:07:18.256
So ah, I'm just going to hold on to this

1:07:22.159 --> 1:07:22.893
till I get the full payment.

1:07:24.694 --> 1:07:25.395
You see anyone leave?

1:07:25.528 --> 1:07:26.763
You follow.

1:07:28.198 --> 1:07:29.065
you call us, ok?

1:07:29.199 --> 1:07:31.067
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:07:31.201 --> 1:07:34.137
That thing in the trunk?

1:07:34.270 --> 1:07:34.736
Yup.

1:07:44.645 --> 1:07:45.613
You know how this works, man.

1:07:45.746 --> 1:07:46.480
I got to get my full payment.

1:07:46.614 --> 1:07:49.016
I made a deal.

1:07:49.150 --> 1:07:51.418

1:07:51.551 --> 1:07:52.153

1:07:52.286 --> 1:07:53.254

1:07:53.386 --> 1:07:55.288
Man, you get the fucking door.

1:07:55.689 --> 1:07:58.457
Dude, you just been sitting there
rolling all day.

1:07:58.591 --> 1:07:59.558
I'll get it.

1:08:02.161 --> 1:08:02.962
It's called work ethic.

1:08:03.095 --> 1:08:05.563
Try it on for size.

1:08:05.698 --> 1:08:08.801
Dougie. Come on.

1:08:09.033 --> 1:08:11.804
I really don't know what's been going on
these last couple days.

1:08:11.936 --> 1:08:12.704
Everything's fucking batshit crazy.

1:08:12.838 --> 1:08:13.437
Trust me.

1:08:17.175 --> 1:08:19.209
Oh, fuck.
We got to get the fuck out of here.

1:08:19.344 --> 1:08:21.912
Come on.

1:08:23.313 --> 1:08:25.414
Go!

1:08:32.487 --> 1:08:33.889
Go, come on!

1:08:39.393 --> 1:08:41.796
Ah, fuck!

1:08:41.929 --> 1:08:45.566
That motherfucker got me!

1:08:47.902 --> 1:08:48.668
I need you two to run behind me.

1:08:51.437 --> 1:08:52.038
Get the fuck out of here.

1:08:52.171 --> 1:08:52.972
Dougie!

1:08:53.106 --> 1:08:53.439
Non-negotiable, man!

1:08:53.573 --> 1:08:55.642
Go!

1:09:02.180 --> 1:09:02.948
Let's go.

1:10:05.736 --> 1:10:06.704
Jess! Jess! Jess!

1:10:06.838 --> 1:10:10.574
Oh, my fucking God. Go!

1:10:24.486 --> 1:10:25.455
You think I don't know.

1:10:25.587 --> 1:10:27.890
Whoa whoa, take it easy, dude.

1:10:28.023 --> 1:10:29.892
Drive. Now.

1:10:30.258 --> 1:10:33.228
You mean, this?

1:10:39.333 --> 1:10:42.135
Drop it, drop it let's go.

1:10:53.645 --> 1:10:54.746
Nice dog.

1:11:01.987 --> 1:11:03.889
What did you get me into?!

1:11:04.022 --> 1:11:05.123
I was supposed to be gone.

1:11:05.256 --> 1:11:07.992
None of this shit was supposed to happen

1:11:11.594 --> 1:11:13.729
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:11:13.864 --> 1:11:16.298
Listen, listen.

1:11:16.433 --> 1:11:20.202
If we get out of this alive,
I'll split everything with you.

1:11:20.336 --> 1:11:23.305
We got to go, come on.

1:11:27.075 --> 1:11:31.913
With the right experience. It's e
a bit harder to hide people

1:11:32.046 --> 1:11:35.850
and I'm sure the whole town is buzzing
right about now.

1:11:35.984 --> 1:11:37.251
We got to get out of here.

1:11:37.384 --> 1:11:38.452
Where doesn't matter
if you don't have a how.

1:11:38.584 --> 1:11:40.653
So I made a phone call.

1:11:40.788 --> 1:11:44.123
I learned early on that the promise of c
could turn a person around,

1:11:44.257 --> 1:11:46.959
especially when they call themselves
a capitalist.

1:11:51.596 --> 1:11:52.932
Sigh.

1:11:53.065 --> 1:11:55.167
I don't know why I'm always saving your

1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:58.069
Maybe it's love Beam?

1:11:58.202 --> 1:11:59.070
Maybe.

1:11:59.203 --> 1:12:01.739
Might be money.

1:12:03.507 --> 1:12:04.141
Ready to roll, clean,

1:12:04.275 --> 1:12:04.875
all yours.

1:12:05.009 --> 1:12:06.377
Thank you, brother.

1:12:06.510 --> 1:12:07.710
Good luck with those dick pics.

1:12:09.611 --> 1:12:11.881
It's a long story.

1:12:25.961 --> 1:12:29.230
We got to get my brother.

1:12:29.363 --> 1:12:30.198
What? No, we have to go!

1:12:30.331 --> 1:12:32.165
They've been to my house.

1:12:46.711 --> 1:12:48.646
Keep it running and get in the driver se
Just in case.

1:12:48.781 --> 1:12:49.782
I'll only be a few minutes.

1:12:49.915 --> 1:12:51.817
I know, I know. Go, go.

1:12:51.951 --> 1:12:52.750
I need the drive.

1:12:52.885 --> 1:12:55.353
No. No, no, fucking way.

1:12:55.487 --> 1:12:56.888
I can't trust you.

1:12:57.021 --> 1:12:59.156
I can't trust you either.

1:13:01.724 --> 1:13:02.426
Dude, I've been shot at.

1:13:02.559 --> 1:13:05.194
Hung, beat up.

1:13:05.329 --> 1:13:06.463
I have nine toes.

1:13:06.597 --> 1:13:10.199
All because you stole
800k from your boyfriend.

1:13:10.333 --> 1:13:13.803
I also got you fired from your last job.

1:13:20.142 --> 1:13:20.375
You what?

1:13:20.775 --> 1:13:22.911
I needed you, Ty.

1:13:26.814 --> 1:13:27.615
You didn't need me.

1:13:27.748 --> 1:13:28.816
You needed a patsy.

1:13:28.949 --> 1:13:29.416
Yeah, that was you.

1:13:44.630 --> 1:13:46.265
I... I...

1:13:50.301 --> 1:13:53.538
Here.

1:13:53.670 --> 1:13:56.741
It's up to 1.2 million now.

1:13:59.509 --> 1:14:00.111
It went up again?

1:14:01.511 --> 1:14:03.113
It never stopped.

1:14:15.124 --> 1:14:16.291
Hey, bud I need you to come with me okay

1:14:16.424 --> 1:14:17.392
Why? What's going on?

1:14:17.525 --> 1:14:20.228
Trust me.

1:14:25.532 --> 1:14:26.034
Where you going?

1:14:26.466 --> 1:14:27.968

1:14:29.469 --> 1:14:32.039
Huh?

1:14:34.607 --> 1:14:36.842
I'm taking Brandon for a few days.

1:14:36.976 --> 1:14:40.512
There's nothing
you gonna say or do about it.

1:14:40.646 --> 1:14:42.447
Okay?

1:14:43.415 --> 1:14:46.051
Are you in trouble again?

1:14:49.888 --> 1:14:51.322
Alright well you better get going then.

1:14:53.991 --> 1:14:54.992
You want to come with us?

1:14:55.125 --> 1:14:58.428
Nah, I can take care of myself.

1:14:58.561 --> 1:14:59.997
But you better get going

1:15:00.130 --> 1:15:01.331
before whatever it is catches up to you.

1:15:09.338 --> 1:15:10.173
Yeah.

1:15:10.305 --> 1:15:15.077
Okay if you see anything let me know.

1:18:15.870 --> 1:18:17.470
Don't sneak up on me in this place.

1:18:18.138 --> 1:18:20.539
I need a piece, Kip.

1:18:24.643 --> 1:18:25.611
How bad is it?

1:18:25.745 --> 1:18:28.013
It's pretty bad.

You did not get that from me.

He's not answering his phone.

1:19:07.047 --> 1:19:07.581
It doesn't matter and can't wait

1:19:09.383 --> 1:19:11.385
What the hell is this?

1:19:11.517 --> 1:19:13.220

Someone's gotta stay in there with him.

1:20:13.406 --> 1:20:14.341
Yeah, good idea.

1:25:05.231 --> 1:25:06.931
Twice actually. I'm okay.

1:25:07.066 --> 1:25:09.000
Go help Ty.

1:25:28.651 --> 1:25:33.054
Oh ho, little girl with a big gun, huh?

1:25:38.359 --> 1:25:40.995
Go find your brother.

1:25:41.129 --> 1:25:45.532
Cops are on the way.

1:25:55.041 --> 1:25:56.075
Who am I?

1:25:58.544 --> 1:26:00.546
I have no idea.

1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:01.513
You killed my brother!

1:26:01.647 --> 1:26:05.950
Dumped him in a ditch.

1:26:06.084 --> 1:26:08.720
That was an accident.

1:26:08.853 --> 1:26:10.453
Just like Sammy!

1:26:10.588 --> 1:26:14.125
You want revenge?

1:26:14.524 --> 1:26:16.493
I'm ready, honey.

1:26:19.797 --> 1:26:21.298
Nah.

1:26:21.430 --> 1:26:26.736
I'm gonna spend your money while you rot

1:26:35.409 --> 1:26:39.413
It's empty.

1:26:48.255 --> 1:26:51.356
Hey.

1:26:51.490 --> 1:26:52.390
Don't tell Dad.

1:26:52.525 --> 1:26:54.994
Okay.

1:27:04.769 --> 1:27:09.573
You mind if I take your brother
for a minute?

1:27:15.011 --> 1:27:16.714
I need you to keep the place locked up.

1:27:16.847 --> 1:27:18.281
K, make sure none of my customers stuff

1:27:18.413 --> 1:27:20.350
Okay?

1:27:20.482 --> 1:27:21.050
Promise me.

1:27:21.184 --> 1:27:22.051
Yeah.

1:27:22.185 --> 1:27:25.755
Good man.

1:27:33.227 --> 1:27:36.230
Bet that stings a little, huh?

1:27:36.364 --> 1:27:40.567
So the guy he said
was locked in your unit, wasn't there?

1:27:40.701 --> 1:27:41.167
He escaped through the ceiling I think.

1:27:45.471 --> 1:27:48.108
There's no sign of the girl anywhere eit

1:27:50.409 --> 1:27:55.446
You're being straight with me, right?

1:27:55.580 --> 1:27:57.548
Yeah. Mm hmm.

1:27:58.616 --> 1:27:59.584
Okay.

1:28:00.351 --> 1:28:02.586
It's probably the same guys involved
in a shoot out across town.

1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:04.421
That's horrible.

1:28:05.088 --> 1:28:06.423
Yeah.

1:28:06.556 --> 1:28:09.661
Sucks. It's a fucking mess.

1:28:12.029 --> 1:28:13.897
Kip told me you're on parole.

1:28:14.030 --> 1:28:15.965
Yeah.

1:28:16.098 --> 1:28:20.069
But you were just in here
moving your stuff, right?

1:28:20.502 --> 1:28:21.636
Yeah, uh huh.

1:28:21.771 --> 1:28:23.138
Kip's an old friend of ours from the for

1:28:23.271 --> 1:28:27.776
Yeah.

1:28:27.910 --> 1:28:29.911
I saw you in here the other day.

1:28:31.346 --> 1:28:33.882
No, you didn't.

1:28:35.149 --> 1:28:37.051
You're right. No.

1:28:40.387 --> 1:28:41.487
Somebody else.

1:28:41.621 --> 1:28:43.189
Yeah. You're gonna lock up for him, righ

1:28:43.323 --> 1:28:44.324
Yeah.

1:28:44.489 --> 1:28:45.291
Yeah.

1:28:45.425 --> 1:28:46.059
Keep an eye on the place.

1:28:46.192 --> 1:28:48.428
Oh, yeah.

1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:49.161
Until he gets out.

1:28:49.294 --> 1:28:51.029
Uh huh.

1:28:51.163 --> 1:28:52.331
Alright.

1:28:52.463 --> 1:28:53.933
You be good.

1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:13.650
There's your receipt my friend. Thank yo

1:29:14.751 --> 1:29:16.051
We've got a lot of different options

1:29:16.185 --> 1:29:17.019
So just take a look around
and let me know.

1:29:17.152 --> 1:29:20.923
Of course.

1:29:21.390 --> 1:29:22.490
Do me a favor and go clip 153?

1:29:22.623 --> 1:29:24.258
I thought we weren't doing that anymore.

1:29:30.597 --> 1:29:31.666
I lost the key.

1:29:33.433 --> 1:29:34.001
I'm on it.

1:29:53.584 --> 1:29:54.686
You like it?

1:30:13.602 --> 1:30:15.337
This used to be my brother's car.

1:30:15.470 --> 1:30:17.239
No kidding.

1:30:17.372 --> 1:30:19.641
Same one?

1:30:19.775 --> 1:30:20.342
And you tracked it down?

1:30:23.310 --> 1:30:27.148
It's beautiful.
