06:12.004 --> 06:15.941
You picked the wrong
house you son-of-a-bitch.

06:17.510 --> 06:21.747
What were you gonna do?
Rape my wife?

06:21.749 --> 06:26.418
I should damn well kill you!
It's within my rights.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.953
Answer me boy!

06:27.955 --> 06:30.222
It's ringing.

06:32.692 --> 06:36.294
Ah, hello? Yeah, yeah.
Get me the sheriff's office.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.864
Now you're in for it.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.833
I think there's
something wrong with him.

06:41.835 --> 06:46.371
Yeah Sheriff, this is Kyle
Petis over on Waverly Street.

06:46.373 --> 06:49.408
I just caught some kid
breaking into my house.

06:50.209 --> 06:53.311
Oh no, he isn't going anywhere.

06:55.348 --> 06:59.317
So do you understand those
rights as I've read them to you?

06:59.319 --> 07:01.286
Hello?

07:01.288 --> 07:05.757
Hey... you're gonna need to
acknowledge me son.

07:10.797 --> 07:15.500
Ok, you're not making it any
easier on yourself. Come on.

07:16.903 --> 07:18.637
Inside.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.238
Watch your head.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.641
Turn around.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.179
Feet.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.187
I wouldn't worry about it Kyle.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.689
I don't think he was looking
to hurt you or your wife.

07:37.691 --> 07:40.992
I don't know he looked
like a dam pervert to me.

07:40.994 --> 07:45.163
Ok. Oh... the sheriff's here.
Come on.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.887
- Nice to see you, Frank.
- Sheriff.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.089
Hi, Kyle how are you?

08:11.091 --> 08:12.791
Always a pleasure Mrs. Petis.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.893
- How are you feeing these days?
- Not good.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.775
Not so good? Well, we'll see
what happens with that.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.297
Hey Frank what's the story.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.434
From the looks of it he was just
looking for some cloths and food.

08:22.436 --> 08:24.936
Prescription pills probably.

08:24.938 --> 08:29.441
- Ok. I tell you this though it looks
like he's been to some party. -Yeah.

08:29.443 --> 08:35.212
Frank you look after Mr. and Mrs Petis. I'm gonna have
a word with the boy, ok? Nice to see you Mrs. Petis.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.448
Good luck!

08:36.450 --> 08:38.250
Ok.

08:50.963 --> 08:52.631
Ok...

08:52.633 --> 08:55.967
I just want you to know that
I'm here to help you. Ok son?

08:57.270 --> 08:59.271
What's your name?

09:03.976 --> 09:09.180
Well, it seems to me that you're
already in a little bit of trouble.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.583
We can make this easy so
I'm gonna ask you again...

09:11.585 --> 09:14.219
What's you're name son?

09:15.955 --> 09:21.459
Ok. I'm just going to take a
little look at you, ok?

09:21.461 --> 09:23.795
Nice and easy.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.630
I'm just going to
lift your head.

09:25.632 --> 09:29.601
Nice and easy, ok son?
Give me a look at you.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.807
Jesus!

09:37.176 --> 09:40.045
Frank!... Frank.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.947
- Get the cuffs off the guy right now!
- What?

09:41.949 --> 09:44.249
Get the cuffs off him right now!
Get him a blanket!

10:18.084 --> 10:20.719
We're the same age,
you know that?

10:20.721 --> 10:24.022
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding, Frank.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.024
What happened to you?

10:28.662 --> 10:30.829
It's not that funny, Jim.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.031
It's not the years,
it's the mileage, right?

10:33.033 --> 10:35.767
Yeah. I hear ya.

10:35.769 --> 10:39.404
I'd say wake me, shake me
if I wasn't already, Frank.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.040
What are you saying?

10:44.543 --> 10:47.445
That's Aaron Porter.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.849
Yeah, that's right.
You remember Aaron?

10:50.851 --> 10:52.817
That's my wife's brother.

10:54.220 --> 10:58.289
We left for the Gulf about
twenty years ago together.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.592
I ain't buying it.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.945
Are you okay?

11:25.384 --> 11:27.686
Aaron...

11:40.166 --> 11:43.468
I'm real sorry we had
to bring you here, man.

11:43.470 --> 11:48.606
We just kind of had to...
make sure.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.611
Listen to me.

11:53.613 --> 11:57.449
I've got a spare bedroom back at the house
and you're coming home with me today.

11:57.451 --> 12:00.218
I'm taking you home.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.959
Jesus.

12:10.863 --> 12:14.099
Where the hell have you
been all these years, man?

12:15.134 --> 12:17.502
Where ya been?

12:25.010 --> 12:27.479
It's okay, man.

12:27.481 --> 12:30.982
It's okay. We have plenty of time
to talk about that. I'm sorry.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.485
For now let's
just get you home.

12:33.487 --> 12:37.555
Get you sorted. Come on...
Come on.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.425
Come on, man. I've got ya.

12:42.161 --> 12:46.765
Come on, I've got you.
Let's get you home.

12:59.512 --> 13:04.315
So after all this time, you decide to talk to me
about Aaron and this is what you come up with?

13:04.317 --> 13:06.684
He's alive?

13:06.686 --> 13:09.521
No. It's not like that.

13:09.523 --> 13:13.558
Okay, just...
go with me on this.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.226
What are you doing, David?

13:15.228 --> 13:17.595
I know there's a lot of things
that I haven't shared with you.

13:17.597 --> 13:21.466
My brother is dead! David!

13:23.502 --> 13:25.670
My brother's dead.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.039
Just go with me on this.

13:45.724 --> 13:49.060
Aaron... How? Oh God!

13:49.062 --> 13:52.130
It's okay! It's okay!
It's Okay.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.898
Let me touch him!

13:58.804 --> 14:01.773
Aaron!

14:30.769 --> 14:33.171
Ugh! You eat like a pig!

14:33.173 --> 14:36.441
Erin! Sweetheart, that's not
polite.

14:42.948 --> 14:44.949
Oh...

14:46.485 --> 14:48.152
Okay.

14:49.955 --> 14:53.091
It's okay. There's plenty more
where that came from, right?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.826
Since you've made room.

14:54.828 --> 14:56.561
Here you go, Aaron.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.497
Enjoy!

15:02.868 --> 15:07.372
Aaron, I just, I don't understand!
It's been twenty years!

15:07.374 --> 15:09.974
Where have you been?

15:09.976 --> 15:14.012
He hasn't aged a day in
those years either, has he?

15:14.014 --> 15:16.581
What's wrong? Can't talk?

15:21.020 --> 15:24.222
You know, maybe we should take him to
see the doctor and get him checked out?

15:24.224 --> 15:27.692
You better talk or else they're
going to make you go to the doctor!

15:29.862 --> 15:32.964
What you should know is we found him
going through your folks old home.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.800
Maybe you should take him
to see your father first.

15:35.802 --> 15:39.003
Sweetheart, I don't know.
Dad is just...

15:42.207 --> 15:46.344
Aaron, do you want to go see
Dad?

15:51.016 --> 15:55.486
Aaron, you need to know that his mind has
deteriorated a lot over the last few years.

15:55.488 --> 15:59.290
He's not gonna know who you are.
You have to know that.

16:12.071 --> 16:17.175
Hey, Dad. It's me Andrea.
Your daughter.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.944
And Erin, your
granddaughter is here too.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.046
Hi, Grandpa.

16:22.048 --> 16:25.249
I've already had lunch.
Please come back a little later.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.085
It's your turn.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.654
And no making up
new words this time.

16:30.422 --> 16:33.091
Who are you talking to, Dad?

16:33.093 --> 16:35.593
What do you mean?
I'm talking to Keith.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.597
Look, Dad. I brought you a
visitor.

16:39.599 --> 16:44.736
I'm sorry, child. You're a lovely
young woman but I'm not your father.

16:48.407 --> 16:53.411
Hey, buddy, sit down. You can,
you can play for Keith. Come on.

17:00.085 --> 17:05.022
All right. You go ahead, uh...
He was starting over here.

17:20.105 --> 17:24.108
That's very nice, but you
can't use a proper name.

17:25.611 --> 17:29.113
Dad, he's introducing himself to you.
Aaron is his name.

17:29.115 --> 17:32.984
I know the name of my own boy!

17:32.986 --> 17:36.821
Where... Where's you're
lovely Lucy? hu?

17:36.823 --> 17:39.624
Beautiful Lucy, hu?

17:40.826 --> 17:42.760
Damn it, Aaron!

17:45.197 --> 17:49.000
I love you, son, but you
were never too graceful.

17:50.602 --> 17:52.837
You know, I wouldn't...

17:52.839 --> 17:56.707
I don't think you should join the
service because I don't think

17:56.709 --> 18:00.278
I would feel too good about you
carrying a gun.

18:10.456 --> 18:14.192
She was diagnosed around
Thanksgiving, ten years ago.

18:15.727 --> 18:19.464
The doctor said she never stood a chance.
It spread so fast.

18:21.133 --> 18:24.502
But if she was scared of
dying, she never showed it.

18:25.871 --> 18:29.974
As a matter of fact, right
before she went... she smiled!

18:29.976 --> 18:33.845
And she said she
would say hello to you for us.

18:39.218 --> 18:43.221
You know, it never occurred
to me until just now that...

18:43.223 --> 18:46.390
you weren't
there, waiting for her.

19:33.138 --> 19:34.839
Hey Bobby...

19:38.911 --> 19:40.378
What's going on?

19:40.380 --> 19:43.481
Someone broke into a house on
Waverly St last night.

19:43.483 --> 19:47.418
Turns out, it was that kid who disappeared
in the Gulf War twenty years ago.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.520
And everyone thought he was
dead.

20:26.858 --> 20:29.527
You know I have never seen
anything like this before.

20:29.529 --> 20:33.130
All of his vital systems seem to be
functioning like a textbook twenty year old.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.433
But it's like he's
frozen in time.

20:37.703 --> 20:41.706
That's nice. Now what about the
inability to speak?

20:41.708 --> 20:44.976
I can't find any reason
physically why he can't talk.

20:44.978 --> 20:47.778
I assume he was just exposed to
some kind of a traumatic experience

20:47.780 --> 20:50.381
that has affected his
desire to want to talk.

20:50.383 --> 20:57.822
Wow. So you're saying that maybe
he needs a psychiatrist?

20:57.824 --> 21:01.559
I think for now let's let him get used to
being back at home and get comfortable.

21:01.561 --> 21:06.063
I think that once he's reacclimated to his
environment he'll start to talk again.

21:06.065 --> 21:10.167
If for whatever reason he doesn't,
then we'll pursue our other options.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.239
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.208
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

21:20.379 --> 21:22.780
I guess we take him home.

21:27.486 --> 21:29.654
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

21:30.722 --> 21:33.758
- Hey, just a regular coffee.
- Okay.

21:33.760 --> 21:38.095
- Connor, put that on my bill, please.
- Sure.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.797
Hey, David.

21:40.766 --> 21:43.668
- It's nice to see you.
- You too.

21:45.437 --> 21:50.174
So, you got my message
about this evening, right?

21:50.176 --> 21:52.043
Yeah, I did.

21:53.378 --> 21:55.546
Any chance we may see you there?

21:57.182 --> 21:59.550
Can we talk?

21:59.552 --> 22:02.420
Yeah, of course. Sure, please.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.491
I'm sorry I haven't
called you back.

22:09.027 --> 22:12.663
I am... I'm still trying to wrap
my head around all of this.

22:13.799 --> 22:16.901
I know. We all are.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.871
Lucy...

22:20.873 --> 22:24.975
if you don't show up tonight it's okay.
Nobody is gonna think any less of you.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.144
It's... It's an awkward
situation.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.447
No, I want to come. I do.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.785
It's just that, uh...

22:39.224 --> 22:42.860
it took so much for me to
get over losing him.

22:45.063 --> 22:47.431
I mean, it was the hardest
thing I've ever done.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.637
And bringing all
of that back...

22:56.575 --> 22:59.110
I don't know
if I can handle it, David.

23:08.153 --> 23:10.221
So...

23:12.591 --> 23:15.526
he's really back?

23:15.528 --> 23:16.560
It's really him?

23:18.263 --> 23:20.097
Yeah.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.667
Lucy...

23:25.003 --> 23:30.107
I hope to see you there tonight,
I mean, come on, we all do.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.543
But you need to be
selfish with this.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.378
And...

23:34.380 --> 23:36.881
It's okay.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.315
Just.

23:39.284 --> 23:41.919
Just do what's best for you.

23:45.724 --> 23:47.691
I'll see you.

23:54.399 --> 23:57.935
There you go! Here... Come on.

23:59.304 --> 24:01.138
You got her?

24:02.207 --> 24:04.375
Here try this one
it's kind of light.

24:04.377 --> 24:06.218
And this one's for you, Erin.

24:08.213 --> 24:10.281
Good afternoon, Sheriff.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.185
Good afternoon.

24:14.187 --> 24:16.253
Can I help you?

24:16.255 --> 24:18.355
Quite possibly.

24:21.893 --> 24:23.761
Do me a favor and go inside?

24:23.763 --> 24:26.897
I'll see you in a second.
Come on, take Erin inside.

24:36.241 --> 24:39.510
Lovely little girl
you have there.

24:39.512 --> 24:44.882
That young man though, he's
a bit peculiar, isn't he?

24:46.284 --> 24:48.185
Well that's my wife's brother.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.187
He's just returned home after
being gone a very long time.

24:50.189 --> 24:53.491
I know. I've been reading
all about him.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.393
Who are you?

24:58.263 --> 25:01.365
Just a concerned citizen.

25:01.367 --> 25:03.434
A friend.

25:03.436 --> 25:04.935
Okay.

25:04.937 --> 25:08.973
So what is it you're
concerned about, friend?

25:08.975 --> 25:13.511
The whereabouts of your wife's
brother for the last twenty years.

25:16.147 --> 25:19.650
Don't you think that it's a little bit
strange that he hasn't aged at all

25:19.652 --> 25:22.219
in the twenty years
he's been missing?

25:23.154 --> 25:24.989
Actually we never really
thought about it like that.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.991
We're just happy
to have him home.

25:26.993 --> 25:31.529
As you should be.
But he's not here for good.

25:33.598 --> 25:35.299
What do you mean by that?

25:38.670 --> 25:46.670
They reappear, then... three, six, sometimes
ten days later... they disappear.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.881
It's different every time.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.285
Okay, who do you work for?

25:55.687 --> 26:00.124
I think that the reason
they don't talk...

26:00.126 --> 26:03.627
is because they forget how.

26:03.629 --> 26:07.831
My theory is that up there
they communicate by telepathy.

26:11.269 --> 26:12.603
Okay.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.872
I don't who you are or
what it is that you want

26:14.874 --> 26:18.008
but I do suggest that
you get off my property.

26:18.010 --> 26:21.445
I also suggest you stay
away from my family.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.883
He doesn't have a lot
of time left, Sheriff.

26:25.885 --> 26:29.420
He's already been
here two days.

26:48.407 --> 26:55.045
Three of clubs? No. King of clubs?
No. Ace of clubs? Nine of clubs?

27:03.922 --> 27:06.083
So where the hell has
he been this whole time?

27:09.327 --> 27:13.530
I am sure glad I got out of going
to that hell hole, you know?

27:13.532 --> 27:18.102
Could have been me. Could have
been me instead of that poor guy.

27:18.104 --> 27:21.105
It's crazy. I heard that
when they found him

27:21.107 --> 27:23.941
he was naked like a newborn.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.243
It's like he fell
out of the sky.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.347
Karma's a bitch, ain't it?

27:30.349 --> 27:31.582
What do you mean?

27:31.584 --> 27:35.519
Well, let's put it this way...

27:35.521 --> 27:38.522
He wasn't exactly
the nicest kid in town.

27:38.524 --> 27:42.426
There weren't a lot of people
all torn-up when he went MIA.

27:43.361 --> 27:46.063
He was a real charmer,
you know that?

27:49.234 --> 27:54.538
So, umm.. I did a little research
on that suited woman, right.

27:54.540 --> 27:57.474
Apparently every time
an MIA soldier reappears

27:57.476 --> 28:01.478
this group comes out of the woodwork
and screams conspiracy theory.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.480
They, uh...

28:03.482 --> 28:05.883
believe that these soldiers
were abducted by aliens.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.819
Aliens?

28:08.821 --> 28:11.955
Really? Come on,
that's ridiculous.

28:11.957 --> 28:14.925
Hey I'm just saying
that's the lady's MO.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.928
- They really believe this?
- Mmhmm.

28:17.930 --> 28:22.900
Aaron was not abducted by
little green space men. Right?

28:24.803 --> 28:26.837
I don't know what
to say anymore.

28:26.839 --> 28:29.907
I have no clue
what's going on... I.

28:30.775 --> 28:33.777
How's he doing anyway?

28:33.779 --> 28:35.612
He's not even at his own party.

28:35.614 --> 28:38.315
He's been standing by the
barn for about an hour.

28:38.317 --> 28:41.785
- Alone?
- Yeah, yeah... I think.

28:41.787 --> 28:44.988
You know... he's just disappointed
that Lucy didn't come.

28:47.092 --> 28:48.425
She might show.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.661
No.

28:50.663 --> 28:52.429
Lucy's not coming.

29:14.385 --> 29:16.687
Here ya go.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.931
You see anything up there?

29:47.418 --> 29:50.254
You know Aaron, about Lucy...

29:50.256 --> 29:53.090
I just want
you to know that, umhm...

29:53.092 --> 29:56.126
It was real rough for her, man.

29:57.362 --> 30:01.365
We were all kind of worried
about her for a long time.

30:01.367 --> 30:05.235
As time went on she came to
terms with the situation.

30:07.705 --> 30:10.541
She met James.

30:11.276 --> 30:12.810
Nice guy.

30:13.945 --> 30:16.947
Nice guy.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.883
To be honest, he kind
of saved her life.

30:19.885 --> 30:21.552
They got married.

30:21.554 --> 30:23.887
They had a kid.

30:23.889 --> 30:28.792
She got her life back on
track, Aaron, and then...

30:28.794 --> 30:35.866
you come back and pop up out of
nowhere after twenty years, man.

30:38.369 --> 30:43.073
All I'm saying is
that you'll see her.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.542
You'll see her in time.

30:45.544 --> 30:47.811
And when you do the
time will be right.

30:47.813 --> 30:51.114
I mean you're not
going anywhere, right?

30:51.116 --> 30:54.117
Right? You're not going
anywhere?

31:07.832 --> 31:12.870
Thank you for seeing me home, young man.
I really had a wonderful time.

31:14.072 --> 31:17.741
You can come by any time
for Scrabble, Keith.

31:17.743 --> 31:20.444
It's always a
pleasure to see you.

31:46.104 --> 31:48.338
Hello Aaron.

31:50.174 --> 31:52.809
Can I give you a ride, son?

31:58.516 --> 32:01.351
I can take you to
your sister's house.

32:03.621 --> 32:05.455
Hop in.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.191
Come on.

32:20.204 --> 32:24.474
Come on. It's okay.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.816
Actually we're going to
go get a cup of coffee.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.751
My treat.

32:34.753 --> 32:38.355
There's something I'd
love to talk to you about.

32:47.699 --> 32:51.468
First off, Aaron, I just
wanted to welcome you home.

32:53.071 --> 32:56.006
Where have you been
for so long, son?

32:57.375 --> 33:00.010
You're not staying, are you?

33:03.514 --> 33:05.549
I didn't think so.

33:09.120 --> 33:13.757
Look, I don't wanna hurtanyone.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.692
On the contrary...

33:15.694 --> 33:17.527
I wanna help.

33:17.529 --> 33:20.664
I want to understand.

33:21.299 --> 33:23.767
About them.

33:27.572 --> 33:30.774
You're reading my thoughts
right now, aren't you?

33:30.776 --> 33:34.111
This is how you
communicate, isn't it?

33:40.885 --> 33:43.887
I just want to understand.

33:54.966 --> 33:59.936
Help me to understand, Aaron.

34:46.150 --> 34:48.985
Dude... Dude, you got
about three seconds...

34:48.987 --> 34:52.722
Wait, that's the guy.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.458
This guy?

34:54.460 --> 34:58.895
He's my mom's boyfriend that went
missing all those years ago.

34:58.897 --> 35:02.466
She... showed me
pictures of you.

35:02.468 --> 35:06.136
She still talks about you
sometimes.

35:06.138 --> 35:09.840
I hate to interrupt, Aaron,
but can we please finish?

35:09.842 --> 35:12.676
Uh, who are you?

35:12.678 --> 35:17.481
It looks like you're the one
looking for trouble here, lady.

35:44.842 --> 35:48.845
It's half an hour past
your curfew, young lady.

36:21.379 --> 36:23.580
We'll be upstairs.

36:49.974 --> 36:52.375
I didn't believe it was you.

36:55.179 --> 36:58.782
Even after I saw your picture.

37:10.428 --> 37:14.264
Sorry I didn't get to
your welcome home party.

37:21.172 --> 37:24.241
It's been a confusing week.

37:32.516 --> 37:35.485
Do you... Do you drink coffee?

37:43.160 --> 37:45.962
It's really you.

37:54.639 --> 37:57.774
For years I dreamt
about running into you.

37:59.844 --> 38:02.145
What I would say to you.

38:06.150 --> 38:10.186
The first year you were
gone I saw you everywhere.

38:13.691 --> 38:17.494
I'd see you in every dark
haired man on the street.

38:21.232 --> 38:26.403
One time I even grabbed a total
stranger and began to hug him and cry.

39:01.272 --> 39:05.408
That's Lindsey. My little baby.

39:06.243 --> 39:08.778
You've met her.

39:12.149 --> 39:16.119
She's just a couple of years shy
of the age we were when you left.

39:17.955 --> 39:20.623
Can you believe that?

39:35.673 --> 39:38.174
That's James.

39:38.176 --> 39:40.243
Lindsey's father.

39:44.348 --> 39:48.551
He works most nights.
That's why he's not here now.

39:52.623 --> 39:55.759
Bur he was never you.

40:02.032 --> 40:04.367
Something wrong
with the front door?

40:04.369 --> 40:07.070
I'm gonna smoke a cigarette.

40:13.644 --> 40:16.780
I should take you home.

40:42.006 --> 40:46.042
Something happened?

40:46.044 --> 40:50.046
Something that's making
you not wanna talk?

40:50.048 --> 40:53.983
Whatever it was,
it must have been bad.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.455
No?

41:03.360 --> 41:05.495
I'm just...

41:08.165 --> 41:11.134
I'm just glad to have you back.

41:29.453 --> 41:32.822
It's like you never left.

41:41.432 --> 41:45.368
If it wasn't for me I'd swear
we just traveled back in time.

41:56.146 --> 42:00.149
I just...

42:00.151 --> 42:05.421
I just wish that there was some way that you
could assure me this is not just a dream.

42:14.398 --> 42:16.766
Okay!

42:19.637 --> 42:24.207
Okay, well, it's past
your curfew too, so...

42:39.423 --> 42:42.025
I work for the local paper.

42:42.027 --> 42:44.961
I've been there for
about eight years now.

42:46.764 --> 42:49.966
Anyway, I'm usually
home about seven.

42:58.175 --> 43:01.144
I'd really like
to see you again.

43:04.848 --> 43:08.651
Whatever it is,
you can tell me.

43:34.044 --> 43:36.679
Good night, Aaron.

43:42.152 --> 43:44.687
Lucy!

45:18.449 --> 45:19.949
Hey, sweetie.

45:20.584 --> 45:22.618
Hey.

45:24.288 --> 45:26.255
How was work?

45:28.325 --> 45:30.126
Where have you been?

45:32.429 --> 45:35.665
I uh, I just gave a
friend a ride home.

45:37.367 --> 45:40.470
Is there something going
on I should know about?

45:41.438 --> 45:43.773
No.

45:43.775 --> 45:46.843
I know he was the
love of your life.

45:47.978 --> 45:50.813
You never talked about him.

45:54.118 --> 45:56.018
But I knew.

45:59.723 --> 46:02.792
He was the love of my life.

46:02.794 --> 46:05.628
That was twenty years ago.

46:07.698 --> 46:09.398
You're my life now.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.768
You and Lindsey.

46:16.874 --> 46:20.343
You still have feelings
for him though.

46:25.315 --> 46:28.885
It's... It's confusing.

46:35.826 --> 46:38.528
He was dead!

46:40.731 --> 46:43.800
We had a funeral for him.

46:49.173 --> 46:54.177
And it took me a very
long time to get over him.

47:05.889 --> 47:08.825
I'm going to bed.

47:20.737 --> 47:25.241
Oh!... Oh my God, Aaron!
Aaron, what is this?

47:25.243 --> 47:27.710
What happened to you?!

47:27.712 --> 47:31.848
Aaron! Let me see! Let me see!
Let me see!!

47:43.460 --> 47:47.463
Are you sure you're okay?

47:47.465 --> 47:51.267
Aaron, maybe I should
call the doctor.

47:54.471 --> 48:00.243
Look, I so wish that I knew
what you've been through.

48:02.479 --> 48:07.216
You're gonna make me wait until
you're ready to tell me, huh?

48:08.085 --> 48:11.387
Okay.

48:37.648 --> 48:40.249
Come on in, man.

48:43.153 --> 48:46.689
Come on in man! Come on,
take a seat.

49:05.242 --> 49:08.577
You remember our band,
The Moody Dudes, right?

49:08.579 --> 49:11.147
Can you believe that?
The Moody Dudes!

49:11.149 --> 49:15.017
Fortunately for us our music was a lot
better than the name of the band, bro!

49:17.054 --> 49:19.522
Come on and take a seat, Aaron.

49:21.191 --> 49:24.393
You liked this one.
I remember you loved this one.

49:30.701 --> 49:32.768
You know...

49:32.770 --> 49:37.840
Keith and Tim came over after the war and
we had a pretty cool jam session, man.

49:37.842 --> 49:40.910
It brought back a lot of
memories, let me tell you.

49:43.847 --> 49:46.849
But it wasn't the
same without you, man.

50:11.141 --> 50:12.908
You know what that is, right?

50:12.910 --> 50:15.344
I'm sure you remember that.

52:00.718 --> 52:05.554
<i>Sit on this.</i>
<i>I don't want you along.</i>

52:33.917 --> 52:36.418
It's incredible, isn't it?

52:39.055 --> 52:43.359
Twenty God-damn years, man.

52:45.629 --> 52:48.430
I mean there was a
funeral and everything.

52:48.432 --> 52:49.965
A lot of people
showed up for it too.

52:49.967 --> 52:52.401
I heard it was really nice.

52:52.403 --> 52:55.971
A lot of people
were real broken up.

52:55.973 --> 52:58.941
A lot of people weren't.

52:59.809 --> 53:01.744
Yeah.

53:12.322 --> 53:17.626
I don't remember you
drinking that much.

53:17.628 --> 53:19.328
Yeah.

53:19.330 --> 53:22.231
I don't remember you
saying so little.

53:22.233 --> 53:28.337
Besides, I've got a lot
on my mind since the war.

53:28.339 --> 53:30.573
Like what?

53:32.742 --> 53:34.176
You know.

53:34.178 --> 53:38.013
Like maybe it was my fault
that you were taken away.

53:38.015 --> 53:41.283
There was nothing
you could do, right?

53:44.321 --> 53:46.589
Is that what you think?

53:46.591 --> 53:48.524
It's the truth.

53:48.526 --> 53:50.593
No.

53:50.595 --> 53:52.294
I don't believe you.

53:52.296 --> 53:56.098
That's not what you believe.

53:57.267 --> 54:00.436
You were my brother.

54:00.438 --> 54:03.305
My best friend.

54:05.709 --> 54:07.876
And you looked into my eyes...

54:11.481 --> 54:14.550
and then you turned away.

54:17.988 --> 54:20.222
I froze, man.

54:20.224 --> 54:22.157
I just froze.

54:22.159 --> 54:26.795
I mean, I thought that... maybe there
was something I could do to help

54:26.797 --> 54:30.299
you know... to give you a
chance, but uh...

54:30.301 --> 54:32.901
I just started thinking about
this place.

54:32.903 --> 54:38.040
I thought about being
back here and, uh...

54:38.042 --> 54:41.477
Yeah, I decided to save myself.

54:43.346 --> 54:45.514
And you did.

54:46.750 --> 54:51.353
You took care of yourself.

54:51.355 --> 54:59.355
Yeah, yeah... After awhile they
thought I was a liability, you know

55:00.031 --> 55:04.433
I was discharged...

55:04.435 --> 55:06.902
They put me on the
psychiatric evaluation.

55:06.904 --> 55:10.272
And you know what? I don't care! I
don't care about any of that anymore.

55:10.274 --> 55:14.610
I was just...

55:14.612 --> 55:16.745
I was just thinking
about you, man!

55:16.747 --> 55:18.080
And where you were.

55:18.082 --> 55:22.117
And hoping that one day
you would forgive me.

55:22.119 --> 55:25.454
I knew that you
would forgive me!

55:25.456 --> 55:27.256
I knew that you'd
forgive me, Aaron.

55:27.258 --> 55:30.025
And I started thinking
about your folks, man!

55:30.027 --> 55:33.295
About your folks and about
Lucy... and about

55:33.297 --> 55:37.132
Andrea. What if...

55:37.134 --> 55:39.301
What if they knew?

55:39.303 --> 55:41.270
What if they knew what I did?

55:41.272 --> 55:43.605
I couldn't tell anybody.

55:43.607 --> 55:47.743
I walked around this town for twenty
years not being able to tell anybody!

55:47.745 --> 55:50.346
Nothing!!

55:53.450 --> 55:58.554
Yeah, I have to live with that.
That's my fault and I know that.

55:58.556 --> 56:01.724
I walked away.

56:01.726 --> 56:03.959
Yeah...

56:05.929 --> 56:08.864
Yeah, I walked away, man.

56:17.407 --> 56:20.909
So...

56:20.911 --> 56:23.479
I guess...

56:23.481 --> 56:26.248
A little alcohol here and there
makes it a little easier.

56:26.250 --> 56:28.217
Cheers, Aaron!

56:28.918 --> 56:30.586
Cheers?

56:33.089 --> 56:35.824
There's another one,
sorry about that.

56:36.826 --> 56:39.995
- Why don't you just do it?
- Do what?

56:39.997 --> 56:42.197
- No, do it!
- Do what?

56:42.199 --> 56:43.832
What you been wanting
to do for twenty years!

56:43.834 --> 56:45.734
Come on! Do it! Do it!

56:46.636 --> 56:48.837
Do it man!

57:19.702 --> 57:23.806
You remember we used to come
here on days off of school, man?

57:24.741 --> 57:28.677
Just kick back, and hang out.

57:30.547 --> 57:35.150
I remember one day you invited Lisa
"Ass-Face" and, what's her face? Schnulie?

57:35.152 --> 57:36.485
Julie Schnulie.

57:36.487 --> 57:39.221
Julie Schnulie!

57:40.757 --> 57:45.060
By the way, I remember you asked
to play Truth or Dare, man...

57:45.062 --> 57:47.095
and you made out
with Lisa "Ass-Face".

57:47.097 --> 57:50.265
- That was you. -No, it was you and she
was the ugliest woman on the planet.

57:50.267 --> 57:54.670
She was so ugly she
could haunt a house.

57:54.672 --> 57:58.173
- You made out with the ugliest woman!
- No, you made out with her, you did!

57:58.175 --> 57:59.942
You had the picture.
Do you have that picture?

57:59.944 --> 58:01.443
- The crippled nipple?
- The crippled nipple!

58:01.445 --> 58:04.046
Hey man, I just slept with her!
You made out with her!

58:18.294 --> 58:19.194
Hey.

58:19.196 --> 58:21.797
Hey! The master fishermen!

58:21.799 --> 58:23.298
How did you do?

58:23.300 --> 58:24.766
Not good.

58:24.768 --> 58:27.135
We caught an elusive cow fish.

58:28.706 --> 58:33.108
Yeah! Steaks!, steaks
from the supermarket.

58:33.110 --> 58:35.244
So you were an awful fisherman.

58:35.246 --> 58:37.279
But you're handsome
so it's okay.

58:37.281 --> 58:40.482
Listen, I'm gonna take Erin to the
park for a little bit and you...

58:40.484 --> 58:43.385
- Are gonna cook the cowfish?
- Mmhmm. -Good.

58:52.595 --> 58:54.563
You okay?

58:57.066 --> 58:59.067
Yeah. I'm good.

59:00.436 --> 59:02.838
- I'm cooking. -Good, yeah.
- Get out of my kitchen.

59:02.840 --> 59:05.107
- You want to come to the park?
- Yeah.

59:05.109 --> 59:07.776
- Okay. Leave the master.
- You got it! Out of my kitchen.

59:07.778 --> 59:11.313
- And hey, buddy, -Yeah? -I've
got a surprise for you.

59:11.315 --> 59:14.316
We're going out tonight.
Somewhere special.

59:18.488 --> 59:20.989
She's beautiful, isn't she?

59:22.625 --> 59:24.593
Yeah.

59:30.600 --> 59:34.136
So, what do you think?

59:34.138 --> 59:35.804
About what?

59:35.806 --> 59:38.807
Your baby sister.

59:38.809 --> 59:41.910
I was twelve when you left.

59:49.953 --> 59:53.989
I think you're beautiful.

59:53.991 --> 59:56.425
Just like her.

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:06.335
You know, when you left I was too
young to understand it at all.

01:00:06.337 --> 01:00:11.640
It took me a long time.

01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:17.145
Mom and Dad would try and hold it
together whenever I was around

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:22.985
but I saw them cry a lot.

01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:29.091
I wish I could have
been there for you.

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:31.860
I'm so glad that David was.

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:33.595
My friend David.

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:36.431
You married my friend David.

01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:40.602
You know it was you
who brought us together.

01:00:40.604 --> 01:00:44.272
He never really talked about
what happened over there.

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:48.744
He was always really
vague about it.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:54.182
I always felt like he knew
more than he was telling me.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:59.421
But I learned that there are certain
things that you just don't ask about.

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:02.057
Mommy, can you push me?

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.130
Go on!

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:10.399
She's your niece.

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.969
Hi.

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:50.205
Hi!

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.911
Want a push?

01:01:55.913 --> 01:01:57.746
Yeah. Sure!

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:11.793
Did you know that

01:02:11.795 --> 01:02:15.330
when your mom was a little girl, I
used to push her on this same swing?

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:17.632
This very one right here.

01:02:17.634 --> 01:02:19.935
You're mom's big brother.

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:23.472
Yup.

01:02:23.474 --> 01:02:26.341
You look like mom's
little brother.

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:33.348
I suppose I do.

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:37.652
Were you scared up in the sky?

01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:38.820
What do you mean?

01:02:38.822 --> 01:02:41.056
Up in the sky, where you live.

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:43.658
What's it like?

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.861
Who told you that?

01:02:45.863 --> 01:02:48.630
The man from the sky.

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:52.367
Do you see the from the sky?

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:55.103
Sometimes. Do you?

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:13.722
Uncle Aaron, I like that
we have the same name.

01:03:13.724 --> 01:03:16.191
Me too, sweetie.

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:19.427
I'm happy you're here.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:23.165
I wish you didn't have to go.

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.113
Hey, Bobby.

01:03:38.115 --> 01:03:41.082
Someone is here to see you.

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:53.662
What are you doing?

01:03:58.768 --> 01:03:59.968
Hi.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:02.437
Hi.

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:04.706
Is everything okay?

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:07.943
Yeah.

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:10.011
You want to get out of here?

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.647
Yes.

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:13.715
Okay.

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:15.884
Okay.

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:30.398
Are you hungry?

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.934
No.

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:37.305
Then where do you want to go?

01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:40.575
I'd like to show you something.

01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:42.911
Okay.

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:09.004
This is what you
wanted to show me?

01:05:09.006 --> 01:05:11.606
This is where I woke up.

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:15.877
Out here?

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:18.346
How did...
how did you get here?

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.952
I don't know.

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:30.992
Well, what do you remember?

01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:31.494
Pieces.

01:05:35.232 --> 01:05:38.366
Only pieces.

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:41.636
I remember you.

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:45.106
Crying after I was gone.

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:50.478
What, what do you mean?

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.148
You went to our tree.

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:15.337
You went to the bridge where
we kissed for the first time.

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:24.846
You contemplated jumping.

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:32.848
I remember... feeling...
as if I were there.

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:46.001
So much pain.

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:58.780
But there was
nothing I could do.

01:06:58.782 --> 01:07:03.451
Where have you been
all this time, Aaron?

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:10.592
Come on.

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:26.141
Oh! There you are!

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:32.447
We were just passing through
and we saw your car.

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:35.116
And we wanted to make sure
that everything was okay.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:39.320
Everything is fine.

01:07:39.322 --> 01:07:41.990
How are you, Aaron?

01:07:41.992 --> 01:07:44.993
What's going on in those woods?

01:07:44.995 --> 01:07:47.295
Nothing. Just went for a walk.

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:51.099
Seems a little off
the beaten path.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:53.268
Who exactly are you?

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.602
Friends of Aaron.

01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:58.006
Right, Aaron?

01:07:58.008 --> 01:08:00.942
I just wanted to make sure that
everything is okay now that he's home.

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:04.612
Aaron's been through a
traumatic experience.

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:07.515
I'm fine.

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:11.986
Well, look whose talking again!

01:08:11.988 --> 01:08:15.657
We're just going to make sure
that Aaron gets home okay.

01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:18.460
I think I'm perfectly capable of
making sure he gets home okay.

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:19.861
Trust me.

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:22.529
You have no idea
what's going on here.

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:28.236
I think we need to leave now.

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:32.372
Aaron, I've tried
to be nice to you.

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:36.511
But I'm beginning
to lose my patience.

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:41.983
Now this, is a micro tracker.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:44.185
You see...

01:08:44.187 --> 01:08:46.921
we make a small incision,

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:50.524
we put it under your skin,
and you won't feel anything.

01:08:50.527 --> 01:08:52.594
It's totally painless.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:57.564
And you'll never see or
hear from us ever again.

01:08:57.567 --> 01:09:00.201
You're not going to touch him!

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:04.171
But he's going to be gone soon
and then it will be too late.

01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:06.541
You of all people should
appreciate knowing where he goes.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:10.812
I don't care. He's here now.
That's all that matters to me.

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:16.551
He's going to have
to come with us.

01:09:20.221 --> 01:09:22.023
Let's go.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:31.032
Take them.

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:32.760
I think we lost them.

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:34.696
Who are they?

01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:37.999
I'm not really sure.

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:40.335
Well, they wanna track you!

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:43.104
Where do they
think you're going?

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:48.807
Does this have something to do with where
you've been the last twenty years?

01:10:57.019 --> 01:11:00.688
Are you home to stay?

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:08.029
You're not?

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:19.641
Being here with you right now is
more than a wish coming true for me.

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:22.810
For me too.

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:30.518
I love you, Lucy.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.690
I always will.

01:11:35.692 --> 01:11:39.327
Whether I'm here or not.

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:50.405
I haven't been here in years.

01:11:50.407 --> 01:11:51.873
I know.

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:55.536
I'm sorry.

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:03.811
Don't be sorry.

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:09.350
You should go home.

01:13:09.352 --> 01:13:12.720
Should I?

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:32.006
Hi, Dad.

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:45.787
Your mother isn't home yet?

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:47.488
No.

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.123
Any idea where she is?

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:53.661
Not really.

01:13:53.663 --> 01:13:56.731
Did she say what
time she'd be home?

01:13:56.733 --> 01:14:00.501
She didn't say.

01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:04.238
I called her at work.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.476
Louise says she left
early with Aaron.

01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:10.578
- You want to wait out front for me?
- Sure.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.181
It's fine.

01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:15.149
Stay.

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:26.160
You guys spent time
with him, right?

01:14:26.162 --> 01:14:29.597
Yeah, we saw him the other night
at the diner.

01:14:29.599 --> 01:14:31.032
So?

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:32.733
So what?

01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:36.170
So what did you think of him?

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:38.906
Well, he's a couple of
beers short of a six pack.

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:44.579
I guess I would too if I spent
half my life as a hostage.

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:46.581
Is that what you think
happened to him?

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:50.518
I don't know. I guess so.
What else?

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.822
You don't have anything
to worry about, Dad.

01:14:56.892 --> 01:14:59.360
Whose worried?

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.371
You shouldn't be smoking.

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:36.030
Hi, Sweetie.

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:40.234
I'm going out.

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:02.256
First round is on me.

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:06.260
You know, I keep my
shotgun next to the john...

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:10.798
'Cause that's the most vulnerable
position a man can be in.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:15.269
All of a sudden, I hear floor
boards creaking.

01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:20.041
So I get up and I grab my
gun and I sneak out there

01:16:20.043 --> 01:16:25.446
and I sneak up on this son of a bitch rifling
through my wife's clothes in the closet.

01:16:25.448 --> 01:16:27.615
- No kidding?
- Yeah!

01:16:27.617 --> 01:16:31.686
I thought at first he
wanted to rape my wife.

01:16:31.688 --> 01:16:36.324
Turns out he just wanted
to wear her clothes.

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:39.994
Hey, Kyle!...

01:16:39.996 --> 01:16:42.697
Do me a favor and keep it down
a little, will you please?

01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:46.233
Sorry, Sheriff.
I didn't mean to offend you.

01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:48.603
Or your friend.

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:52.540
Oh my God!...

01:16:52.542 --> 01:16:54.709
I can't believe
it's really you.

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:57.178
It's me.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.847
Ass-Face.

01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:05.553
I'm doing good, Lisa.
How you doing?

01:17:05.555 --> 01:17:08.923
It's so good to see you, Aaron.

01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:11.592
What a miracle it is
having you back here.

01:17:11.594 --> 01:17:13.995
Hey, Lisa!

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:20.167
Have you seen Lucy
since you've been back?

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:21.702
It must be rough on her.

01:17:21.704 --> 01:17:23.404
She loses you.

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:25.573
Finally moves on with
her life...

01:17:25.575 --> 01:17:30.177
Gets married, has a kid, then
poof, you're suddenly back!

01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:32.046
Lisa!

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:36.517
What? Just saying.

01:17:36.519 --> 01:17:38.552
Hey, Lisa, baby!

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:41.055
Come back here!

01:17:41.057 --> 01:17:43.257
I'm not your baby, Mike!

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:46.060
Mind your own business!

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:52.033
Sorry about that!

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:09.083
Look, let me ask
you a question.

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:14.121
You remember years ago, we took a
day off school, the three of us,

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:18.125
and we went to the park, uh,
with Julie Scha-Schnule.

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:19.727
- Schnule.
- Schnule! Right.

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:23.097
Wow. I haven't thought about
that in a long time.

01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:29.303
Now the question is,
who did you make out with?

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:30.838
It was you, David!

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.508
It wasn't me, Lisa.

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:38.946
Secretly though,
I wished it was you.

01:19:15.183 --> 01:19:18.119
Hey, baby. Let's dance.

01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:19.553
Mike, you're drunk.

01:19:19.555 --> 01:19:21.856
Ask me again when you're sober.

01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:24.825
I'm dancing with Aaron anyway.

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.535
Mike.

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:36.837
Sheriff.

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:35.362
Oh my God.

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:40.768
Oh my God!

01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:42.536
Hey, time's up.

01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:44.572
Hey!

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:54.048
God damn, God damn...
Hey, hey! You all right!

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:13.801
Go, go, go!

01:21:13.803 --> 01:21:16.837
Hello, this is Sheriff Mendell.
Listen to me very carefully.

01:21:16.839 --> 01:21:20.307
I have a priority one en route.
We're moments away.

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:23.410
I want all medical staff on
hand. Do you understand me?

01:21:23.412 --> 01:21:26.747
Jesus, David.
He's bleeding all over.

01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:29.116
- How far are we, James?
- Still five minutes out, David.

01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:32.786
We're five minutes away. Please have
all available staff standing by!

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:45.866
Yeah.

01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:49.303
I'm not sure. Hopefully soon
though.

01:21:49.305 --> 01:21:50.437
Yeah.

01:21:50.439 --> 01:21:53.507
I'll call you as
soon as I know, ok?

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:59.747
Ok. I love you too, baby. Bye.

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:15.129
Can we go home now?

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:25.940
Yeah. Of course.

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:42.222
- Oh my God!
- It's okay.

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:48.295
- I was gonna come meet you.
- It's fine. It's perfectly fine.

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:52.566
I don't know how.

01:22:55.437 --> 01:23:01.542
The last time I saw that much blood come
out of a man he was anything but okay.

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:03.877
But he's fine.

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:11.518
You were with him
today, weren't you?

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:17.925
Yes.

01:23:21.029 --> 01:23:25.466
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

01:23:25.468 --> 01:23:29.970
About him?

01:23:29.972 --> 01:23:34.608
Where he disappeared
to all those years?

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:37.478
He must have told
you something.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.713
He didn't.

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:45.586
I been trying to
put myself in your shoes

01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:50.557
since this whole thing
happened and when I do...

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:59.266
I don't like what
goes through my head.

01:23:59.268 --> 01:24:03.470
Getting over him was the hardest
thing I ever had to do.

01:24:03.472 --> 01:24:08.742
But getting over him
wasn't the worst part.

01:24:08.744 --> 01:24:12.546
Not knowing was the worst part.

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:19.920
So now I know.

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:26.627
Now I know that he's okay
and...

01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:33.600
and for me... that's enough.

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:55.722
Hey, kiddo.

01:24:55.724 --> 01:24:57.157
Hi, Mommy.

01:24:57.159 --> 01:24:59.626
I am so sorry I'm late again.

01:24:59.628 --> 01:25:01.829
This is the third
time in to weeks.

01:25:01.831 --> 01:25:04.898
I know, Mrs. Helman,
and I am so sorry.

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:09.336
Hey, why don't you grab
your backpack...

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:14.908
Mrs. Mendell, do you mind if
I talk to you for a minute?

01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:17.511
Yeah. Of course.

01:25:17.513 --> 01:25:22.382
Why don't you take your uncle out to the
yard and I'll meet you there. Okay?

01:25:30.658 --> 01:25:34.061
Come on. Come on!

01:26:36.624 --> 01:26:39.393
Sweetie, where's your uncle?

01:26:39.395 --> 01:26:42.596
He's sick again. The people took
him to the hospital.

01:26:42.598 --> 01:26:44.565
What people?

01:26:44.567 --> 01:26:47.434
Don't worry, Mommy.
He'll take care of him.

01:26:47.436 --> 01:26:49.836
Who will?

01:26:49.838 --> 01:26:52.406
Him.

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:13.660
Come on. Sweetie, we gotta go.

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:15.796
What?

01:27:15.798 --> 01:27:17.831
Are you sure?

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:20.467
Oh my God. I'm on it. I'm on it!

01:27:20.469 --> 01:27:23.103
The hospital reported a missing ambulance.
Do you think it's them?

01:27:23.105 --> 01:27:27.040
I do. Do me a favor. Call the County. Get
every available agent they can spare.

01:27:27.042 --> 01:27:29.763
- Get me some eyes in the air.
- Got it. -OK?

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:01.541
What's happening to you?

01:28:01.543 --> 01:28:03.477
There's a lot of blood here.

01:28:07.815 --> 01:28:11.752
Aaron, where were you
when you were shot?

01:28:11.754 --> 01:28:14.221
Desert.

01:28:14.223 --> 01:28:16.723
But that was twenty years ago.

01:28:16.725 --> 01:28:18.325
That would have
killed you then.

01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:21.528
How are you alive now?

01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:24.731
Please, take me back.

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:27.901
Where? Where do you want us
to take you?

01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:29.503
Woods.

01:28:29.505 --> 01:28:33.340
What's in the woods?
Who's waiting there?

01:28:33.342 --> 01:28:35.342
Stop the bleeding.

01:28:35.344 --> 01:28:37.678
I've got to get him
to a hospital.

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:40.347
Just get the
damn tracker in him.

01:28:40.349 --> 01:28:42.783
It's an ambulance, for God sakes.
How hard can it be?

01:28:42.785 --> 01:28:46.253
Yeah, a vehicle in the Allegan Woods.
How hard could that be?

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:19.119
Where are they going?

01:29:19.121 --> 01:29:24.891
Well, where's David?

01:29:24.893 --> 01:29:27.294
I think I know where
they might be taking him.

01:29:27.296 --> 01:29:28.929
Okay, I'll be right over.

01:29:28.931 --> 01:29:32.466
- What's going on? -Aaron was taken.
- Taken by who?

01:29:32.468 --> 01:29:35.469
I'm not really sure. They've got
him in a stolen ambulance.

01:29:35.471 --> 01:29:37.904
So what are you going to do?

01:29:45.414 --> 01:29:51.418
- What the hell's going on? -Just
get dressed and come on out.

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:54.654
And bring your shotgun.

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:06.767
Eagle One, what's your twenty?

01:30:06.769 --> 01:30:09.436
<i>I'm tracking them over</i>
<i>one-twelve, Delta One</i>.

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:14.975
I'm on one-twelve
right now, guys.

01:30:14.977 --> 01:30:17.677
This road doesn't lead anywhere
so stay on them, Eagle One.

01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:19.913
<i>Ten-four, I have eyes on them.</i>

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:27.921
<i>I've lost them in</i>
<i>the brush, Delta One.</i>

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:32.259
Copy, Eagle One. Thank you.

01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:36.463
<i>Heading back to base, Delta One.</i>

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:52.646
Watch him.

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:58.985
- What the hell is going on? -Looks
like someone is blocking the road.

01:30:58.987 --> 01:31:04.491
- Are they cops? -No.
- Then use the siren.

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:28.048
Sorry young lady, this road
is closed.

01:31:28.050 --> 01:31:31.418
You need to get out of my way,
son.

01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:35.021
Hey! Drop it my friend!

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:47.334
This is none of your concern.

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:21.768
- You got him, James? -Yeah. This way.
Let's get him in the car.

01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:25.639
How's he doing back
there, Lindsey?

01:32:25.641 --> 01:32:28.275
He's not doing good.

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:34.414
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say
can and will be used against you in a court of law.

01:32:34.416 --> 01:32:37.784
You have the right to an attorney and
have the right to have one present.

01:32:37.786 --> 01:32:41.988
If you cannot afford an attorney
one will be assigned to you.

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:43.990
You can exercise these
rights at any time.

01:32:43.992 --> 01:32:47.727
- You understand the rights I just read?
- Yes. -All right then.

01:33:00.107 --> 01:33:02.576
What's your mom doing here?

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:11.051
What's going on Andrea?

01:33:11.053 --> 01:33:14.487
Move the car! I need to
get him to the hospital.

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:20.026
David...

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:25.332
Aaron can't stay here anymore.

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:30.337
We have to let him go.

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:35.642
It's okay.

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:50.857
Watch your step.

01:33:55.262 --> 01:33:57.330
Yeah, this way.

01:34:02.069 --> 01:34:05.872
What do we do? Lay him down.

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:25.058
David, no.

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:27.994
It's okay.

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:37.664
Please help him.

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:10.663
Lucy!

01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:54.174
Do you have to go?

01:36:54.176 --> 01:36:56.442
I wish I didn't.

01:36:56.444 --> 01:36:58.711
But I do.

01:36:58.713 --> 01:37:02.582
And I'll be back
before you know it.

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:07.520
I love you.

01:37:07.522 --> 01:37:10.390
I love you.

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:30.076
Hey lover boy!

01:37:30.078 --> 01:37:32.679
Come on! We've got to go!

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:54.601
Take care of each other.

01:37:54.603 --> 01:37:56.970
I promise! I promise I will.
And don't you worry...

01:37:56.972 --> 01:38:00.573
We're coming back to do some big
things. I promise you that!

01:38:00.575 --> 01:38:04.310
Don't worry, Lucy.
I'm indestructable!
