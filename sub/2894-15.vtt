WEBVTT

00:06.039 --> 00:10.676
Asgard, your favorite
son has returned.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.546
Let the great feast...

00:14.781 --> 00:16.515
Oh, no.

00:18.318 --> 00:21.553
Ah, the wayward
prince returns.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.056
Get lost on your way
back from midgard?

00:24.657 --> 00:28.660
Volstagg, tell me we are
both incredibly early.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.029
Mmm-mmm.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.764
Is father upset?

00:31.766 --> 00:34.199
Odin: (screaming)
thor!

00:34.334 --> 00:35.801
No, he's redecorating.

00:35.803 --> 00:41.640
Odin: Has it occurred
to you that thor's day
is a holiday in your honor?

00:41.775 --> 00:43.275
I put your name
right up front,

00:43.277 --> 00:45.210
Hoping you might not forget.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.146
Father, forgive me.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.282
But I was caught up
in a glorious
battle for honor.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.750
The villainous
serpent society...

00:51.752 --> 00:53.452
Is on earth.

00:53.686 --> 00:55.320
(castle rumbles)

00:55.322 --> 00:57.189
Not in asgard.

00:57.590 --> 01:01.593
Thor, I do not understand
this double-life.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.163
Traipsing around
with earthlings.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.165
I hold them no malice.

01:06.366 --> 01:09.101
But humans are fragile.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.603
On this we differ, strongly.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.640
The true power of mankind
comes from within.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.842
In some ways,
they are even stronger...

01:16.844 --> 01:18.677
You try my patience, thor!

01:18.679 --> 01:20.345
Comparing asgard to...

01:20.347 --> 01:21.480
Heimdall:
Apologies, all-father.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.183
I have an important message
for the odinson.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.618
To risk odin's roar,
it must be.

01:26.620 --> 01:32.091
For just a moment,
midgard disappeared
from my all-seeing gaze.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.126
Something is wrong on earth.

01:34.294 --> 01:35.661
(odin grunts)

01:35.663 --> 01:37.729
I'd rather go
with your blessing.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.302
You do not belong
in that world, thor.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.839
One day, humanity
will disappoint you
with their weakness.

01:50.743 --> 01:52.878
Stark, do you read me?

01:52.880 --> 01:54.213
Hmm?

01:56.549 --> 01:58.283
What trickery is this?

01:58.418 --> 02:00.519
Where is avengers tower?

02:03.590 --> 02:04.857
(thor screams)

02:04.859 --> 02:06.625
(grunts)

02:08.261 --> 02:11.630
No, it cannot be.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.167
Doom?

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.282 --> 02:32.851
How could doom have
conquered manhattan
in mere hours?

02:32.853 --> 02:34.553
Where are the avengers?

02:34.721 --> 02:36.321
<i>Intruder detected.</i>
<i>Engaging.</i>

02:43.730 --> 02:45.164
(whirring)

02:58.411 --> 02:59.912
Hawkeye, where have you...

02:59.914 --> 03:01.847
Looks like the intel
is good, people.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.515
Snap, air support.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.654
Falcon?

03:10.356 --> 03:12.357
(spider-man speaking)
for a guy who's
supposed to save humanity,

03:12.359 --> 03:13.926
He seems kind of slow.

03:13.928 --> 03:16.261
I really hope the one
isn't a dumb blonde.

03:16.263 --> 03:19.798
If you'd zip it and help take
out these d-bots, slinger,

03:19.800 --> 03:23.902
(spider-man speaking)
we're sticking our necks
pretty far out there, guy.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.604
So if you are the thunderer...

03:26.773 --> 03:27.940
...A little help?

03:36.382 --> 03:37.649
Enough!

03:44.958 --> 03:47.926
No one call him a dumb
blonde again. Agreed?

03:48.361 --> 03:49.528
Mmm-hmm.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.831
Where is iron man?
Hulk? Captain america?

03:53.433 --> 03:54.900
Barton! What's happened here?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.436
Barton? He knows your id?

03:57.870 --> 04:01.773
Apparently. Looks like
we got a lot to talk about.
But not here.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.408
Defenders, move out.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.611
Defenders?

04:11.451 --> 04:12.951
They call me
bull's-eye barton.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.821
Little guy here
is peter parker.
Call-sign "slinger."

04:15.823 --> 04:18.757
And our aerial specialist
is snap, aka...

04:18.759 --> 04:20.459
Sam wilson, I know.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.894
What I do not know is
how you do not know me.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.764
Pal, if I'd met you,
I wouldn't forget you.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.700
What matters is
they said you'd come.
And here you are.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.035
They?

04:30.037 --> 04:32.371
Ever since victor von
doofus took over,

04:32.373 --> 04:35.007
There's been talk
of the "thunderer."
our salvation.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.576
The only man
doom has ever feared.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.579
With a hammer powerful enough
to knock him off his throne

04:40.581 --> 04:42.381
And bring a new
era of freedom.

04:42.548 --> 04:44.883
Someone exactly like you.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.952
We've been waiting years.
Got a tip from someone

04:46.954 --> 04:48.854
On the inside
you were showing tonight.

04:49.355 --> 04:52.357
Years? But I've only been
gone since this morning.

04:52.359 --> 04:53.492
(laser blasts)

04:55.328 --> 04:56.628
Oh, no! It's her!

04:56.630 --> 04:58.063
(sam grunts)
sam!

04:58.898 --> 05:00.966
Slinger, get us to shore now!

05:08.875 --> 05:11.043
All who defy doom
deserve death

05:11.045 --> 05:13.578
At the hand
of the black bride.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.449
No! You would never
stand with doom!

05:17.717 --> 05:19.951
Tell me this is one
of your spy games, natasha.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.020
How did you know my...

05:22.755 --> 05:23.855
(laughs)

05:24.757 --> 05:27.025
He said you would try
to trick me, thunderer.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.928
We've prepared
a little trick for you.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.898
No more tricks.
No more games!

05:38.971 --> 05:40.072
(thor grunts)

05:41.808 --> 05:43.675
Mjolnir. To me.

05:46.746 --> 05:47.879
Impossible.

05:48.849 --> 05:53.952
Whatever that thing is,
it's sucking up half
the power of manhattan.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.455
We can use the blackout
to cover our escape.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.123
Avengers do not run.

05:59.625 --> 06:01.893
Well, defenders make sure
to stay breathing so they
can fight another day.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.462
Slinger.
Got it.

06:11.437 --> 06:12.771
Take him now!

06:15.408 --> 06:17.109
<i>No targets</i>
<i>in scanning range.</i>

06:17.111 --> 06:18.510
<i>They are gone.</i>

06:19.879 --> 06:21.546
Doom:
Do you have him?

06:21.548 --> 06:22.714
I have his weapon.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.118
Bull's-eye and his
merry men have scurried
back into their holes.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.019
We will find them, my lord.

06:28.154 --> 06:31.656
Of course we will, my bride.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.494
The helicarrier?

06:35.995 --> 06:37.462
It was.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.965
Fury managed to
crash it here before he...

06:41.467 --> 06:42.868
The stealth generators
still work, though.

06:42.870 --> 06:43.935
Thanks to sam and...

06:43.937 --> 06:45.103
(gun cocks)
pete?

06:45.438 --> 06:47.072
She knew you were coming.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.874
Funny tingling in
the back of my neck says

06:48.876 --> 06:51.576
This might just be
another one of doom's traps.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.879
Pete, this is no time
for paranoia.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.748
Paranoia's kept us alive
this long, barton.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.050
How do we know
"the one" is even real?

06:59.052 --> 07:02.921
Why show now?
When we needed him
a long time ago?

07:02.923 --> 07:06.091
I cannot answer that, sam.
I am beyond my depth.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.760
But I am your
ally and friend.

07:08.762 --> 07:13.698
Please, just tell me
how doom came
to wield such control.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.567
(peter sighs)

07:16.002 --> 07:18.069
It started out years ago.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.673
One day he's dictator
of a tiny country
no one's ever heard of,

07:21.675 --> 07:24.042
The next? He's everywhere.

07:24.044 --> 07:27.112
<i>Armed with technology</i>
<i>no one's ever seen before.</i>

07:27.114 --> 07:29.214
<i>No army on earth</i>
<i>could fight him.</i>

07:29.216 --> 07:32.184
<i>So it was join doom</i>
<i>or be obliterated.</i>

07:33.085 --> 07:34.853
That's history 101, blondie.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.721
Not my history.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.225
It was only yesterday
that we fought
together as avengers.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.994
You are all heroes
of great power.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.463
Power? Ha!

07:44.465 --> 07:46.631
All we have is the junk
we cobbled together.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.533
But you, you were the one.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.937
Our sources promised us
this big butt-kicking

07:51.939 --> 07:54.206
Warrior with
a doom-smashing hammer.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.542
No weapon? No threat.
You're not the one.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.713
Whatever curse
vexes this world,
we will stop it.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.482
(lasers blast)

08:03.749 --> 08:04.950
(sam gasps)

08:04.952 --> 08:07.786
See? I told you my
common sense was tingling.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.120
You led her right to us.

08:10.923 --> 08:14.025
No, not her. Him.

08:15.127 --> 08:17.229
Welcome, thunderer.

08:17.231 --> 08:19.931
Your timing could not
be more perfect.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.642
No!

08:32.544 --> 08:33.879
(barton grunts)

08:35.914 --> 08:36.948
(thor growls)

08:41.687 --> 08:42.888
(thor screams)

08:46.559 --> 08:47.959
Natasha:
You are a strong one.

08:48.562 --> 08:53.098
Your traitorous friends
come from much weaker stock.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.232
(thor growls)

08:54.234 --> 08:55.967
Any attempt
to free yourself,

08:55.969 --> 08:58.570
And I'll eliminate
a defender of my choosing.

08:58.938 --> 09:02.040
Natasha, please, listen.
This is all wrong.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.942
Doom has twisted your mind.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.978
Take these three
to the dungeon.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.747
Doom will have words
with this one.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.587
No!

09:16.989 --> 09:21.726
Doom: Captain rogers
has proven a much better
sculpture than soldier.

09:22.762 --> 09:23.995
(roars)

09:31.737 --> 09:32.938
(thor shouts)

09:41.213 --> 09:44.182
Eerily familiar,
is it not, barbarian?

09:44.184 --> 09:48.119
Arc repulsors, enhanced
by banner's gamma rays.

09:48.121 --> 09:51.122
I've spent years preparing
for your arrival.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.059
How did you
conquer everything?

09:54.794 --> 09:57.362
Why do you remember me
when the rest do not?

09:57.364 --> 09:59.898
I conquered nothing.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.068
I saved the earth...
From humanity.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.071
<i>I have eliminated</i>
<i>every disease.</i>

10:06.073 --> 10:08.139
<i>Eradicated world hunger.</i>

10:08.141 --> 10:10.108
<i>Ended petty conflict.</i>

10:10.876 --> 10:14.279
All for the simple price
of abject devotion.

10:14.914 --> 10:17.882
The avengers
would've stopped you.
The fantastic four...

10:17.884 --> 10:20.986
Do not exist!
None of them.

10:20.988 --> 10:24.055
You have heard the saying,
"knowledge is power"?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.358
I have all the knowledge.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.227
Therefore,
I have all the power.

10:29.862 --> 10:32.130
Natasha: My lord,
it's the brain trust.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.867
Stark is agitated. Again.

10:35.869 --> 10:39.004
Stark, have you released
the thunderer's weapon yet?

10:39.006 --> 10:42.807
<i>Hardly. For a hammer,</i>
<i>it's complicated as heck.</i>

10:42.809 --> 10:45.910
<i>We could use the blonde boy</i>
<i>down here for a consult.</i>

10:45.912 --> 10:49.914
<i>Assuming you haven't,</i>
<i>you know,</i>
<i>disintegrated him.</i>

10:52.151 --> 10:54.919
Stark!
Viking guy.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.288
Dress rehearsal
for the opera today?

10:58.991 --> 11:00.258
Mjolnir!

11:00.993 --> 11:02.060
To me!

11:03.095 --> 11:04.829
Stark:
Don't pop a vessel.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.965
Your hammer's locked
in a static time-space bubble.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.199
(groans)

11:09.201 --> 11:12.137
(laughs) your weapon's
not going anywhere,

11:12.139 --> 11:14.706
Except into doom's hand,

11:14.708 --> 11:17.108
As soon as you release
whatever hold you have on it.

11:17.443 --> 11:20.912
I would as soon die than
renounce my bond with mjolnir.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.380
Well, that might work.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.883
Why does no light glow
in your chest, stark?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.985
Why are you working
for our enemy?

11:26.987 --> 11:30.088
Enemy?
Victor saved my life.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.058
<i>I was a weapons maker</i>
<i>for s.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

11:33.060 --> 11:35.360
<i>Until one of the bad guys</i>
<i>grabbed one of my missiles</i>

11:35.362 --> 11:38.029
<i>And shot it right back</i>
<i>in my face.</i>

11:39.165 --> 11:42.400
<i>Suddenly he was just...</i>
<i>There.</i>

11:42.402 --> 11:46.938
If it wasn't for victor,
I would have taken a chestful
of my own shrapnel.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.942
I've been working
for him ever since.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.410
Man: This is the one, huh?

11:53.879 --> 11:55.947
Pretty puny.
Banner?

11:55.949 --> 11:59.484
Surely the hulk
serves no man.
Unleash the monster!

11:59.819 --> 12:01.252
(laughs) monster?

12:01.754 --> 12:04.222
That's exactly what I'd be
if it weren't for victor.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.092
Banner:  <i>There was an accident.</i>

12:07.928 --> 12:12.263
<i>Made this suit to protect me</i>
<i>from my own gamma radiation.</i>

12:13.165 --> 12:16.501
The man revolutionized
power for the entire world.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.070
It's not mind control.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.039
Time.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.408
Somehow you traveled
back in time.

12:23.809 --> 12:27.946
Without extraordinary powers,
I knew they would be
simply human.

12:28.347 --> 12:31.316
So I made certain that
power never found them.

12:31.318 --> 12:36.020
Alas, asgard lies outside
earth's time stream,

12:36.022 --> 12:39.390
But I knew one day
you would appear.

12:40.025 --> 12:42.160
You stopped them
from becoming heroes.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.763
Oh, but they are heroes.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.498
My heroes.

12:46.500 --> 12:50.502
These men helped me
reshape the world,
and they do so willingly.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.871
Now it is your turn.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.072
Release the hammer.

12:54.074 --> 12:57.041
It is the key
to other worlds.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.843
This one is not enough.

12:58.845 --> 13:02.147
Nay! You shall
not corrupt asgard!

13:06.218 --> 13:08.920
Banner, stark,
are you blind?

13:08.922 --> 13:10.955
Doom rules all
with an iron fist.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.191
And you help him
maintain that hold.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.993
(screaming)

13:15.895 --> 13:17.896
There is no winning
this time.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.198
If the fool refuses
to see it,

13:20.200 --> 13:24.102
Prepare the thunderer
and his defenders
for termination.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.975
Doom:
<i>People of planet von doom,</i>

13:30.977 --> 13:33.478
I became emperor by necessity,

13:34.046 --> 13:36.514
<i>To save humanity from itself,</i>

13:36.516 --> 13:39.217
<i>For you are a weak</i>
<i>and corrupt breed.</i>

13:39.219 --> 13:42.887
<i>Without my guidance,</i>
<i>your lives would be chaos.</i>

13:42.889 --> 13:49.327
<i>And when one threatens</i>
<i>order, my order,</i>
<i>they must be eliminated.</i>

13:50.095 --> 13:52.030
(crowd shouting)

13:53.465 --> 13:57.902
Perhaps what my father
says about humanity is true.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.171
Perhaps I do not
know any of you.

14:03.209 --> 14:04.442
(clamoring)

14:04.444 --> 14:10.849
<i>One day humanity</i>
<i>will disappoint you</i>
<i>with their weakness.</i>

14:10.851 --> 14:12.550
(echoing)
<i>weakness... Weakness...</i>

14:12.552 --> 14:14.152
No.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.221
Friends, hear me.

14:16.455 --> 14:21.226
Where I come from,
some believe humanity
to be fragile, weak.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.195
<i>Yet I have dedicated</i>
<i>my life to this planet</i>

14:24.197 --> 14:27.232
<i>Because I believe</i>
<i>in your strength and honor.</i>

14:27.499 --> 14:32.036
I have never
regretted my choice,
and I do not regret it now.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.905
You are better than this.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.241
Stronger! Resist!

14:36.243 --> 14:37.475
Fight!

14:38.611 --> 14:40.044
(doom laughs)

14:40.246 --> 14:42.914
They cannot fight, thunderer.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.883
They're only human.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.923
(crowd chanting)
doom! Doom! Doom!

14:54.660 --> 14:56.027
(weapon whines)

14:56.161 --> 14:57.395
Castle, now!

15:00.065 --> 15:01.199
(grunts)

15:02.234 --> 15:03.668
Sorry, victor.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.004
But I'd rather be
a widow than your bride.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.906
Natasha?

15:07.908 --> 15:09.474
Brain boys, now!

15:11.944 --> 15:13.978
Stark:
No more play acting, victor.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.187
Huh?

15:27.426 --> 15:29.928
We've waited a long time
for you to get here.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.562
You're the only thing
he's ever feared.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.031
Get the defenders
their weapons.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.533
Natasha:
<i>And don't disappoint us.</i>

15:42.074 --> 15:43.541
(grunting)

15:53.485 --> 15:54.719
Punishment served!

15:58.290 --> 16:01.225
Mjolnir! To me!

16:03.595 --> 16:05.096
Fool!

16:05.098 --> 16:06.331
(screaming)

16:08.000 --> 16:10.435
All I have taught you
about power.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.303
You have learned nothing?

16:13.005 --> 16:14.138
(all gasping)

16:16.976 --> 16:18.409
Thor: My friends...

16:19.511 --> 16:21.279
Avengers.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.147
Fight on.

16:25.384 --> 16:28.052
Doom: I have defeated
the last one to oppose me,

16:28.054 --> 16:31.422
And now I wield his power.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.091
(grunts)

16:33.325 --> 16:34.659
Impossible.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.260
That's one thing
you never understood

16:36.262 --> 16:39.097
About us mere humans, victor.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.466
We don't believe
in impossible.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.234
Please work.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.169
(gasps)

16:45.471 --> 16:46.637
Mjolnir!

16:49.708 --> 16:51.242
(thunder rumbling)

17:10.462 --> 17:11.596
No!

17:15.099 --> 17:17.135
Avengers, assemble!

17:17.137 --> 17:18.336
(shouts)

17:20.071 --> 17:22.306
Barton:
"avengers" does
have a nice ring to it.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.277
Doom: No!
All the years of planning!

17:26.279 --> 17:27.578
All I've accomplished!

17:27.780 --> 17:28.813
(screams)

17:29.615 --> 17:31.416
I will just have to try again.

17:31.418 --> 17:34.052
This time
I will get it right.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.229
Time machine.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.297
Huh?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.500
I can do it again.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.069
Go back earlier.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.438
Stop them
from ever being born.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.642
(laughs)

17:58.977 --> 18:02.313
This time I'll ensure
a way to prevent thor
from ever coming to earth.

18:02.315 --> 18:05.349
Then all
will kneel before me.

18:05.351 --> 18:09.187
Without their powers,
they are nothing
before doom!

18:12.825 --> 18:14.392
What?

18:14.394 --> 18:16.494
Do the powers
make the man,

18:16.496 --> 18:18.362
Or does the man
make the power?

18:19.398 --> 18:20.665
Doom!

18:20.799 --> 18:22.100
(groans)

18:22.102 --> 18:25.703
What? You didn't think
I knew about your secret
time-machine room?

18:25.838 --> 18:27.105
But how?

18:27.107 --> 18:29.173
Because no matter
what stark says,

18:29.175 --> 18:31.175
I'm the smartest there is.

18:31.177 --> 18:34.112
Plus it's the only room
you never wanted me to see.

18:34.114 --> 18:38.349
You don't wanna
hit me with the gamma
radiation, do you, vic?

18:38.817 --> 18:40.351
"unleash the monster."

18:41.220 --> 18:43.187
Thor: You've
miscalculated, doom.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.225
Powers or no,
my friends were
born heroes.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.260
That will never change.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.628
Nor will I.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.733
(grunts)

18:55.901 --> 18:57.602
Self destruct code...

18:57.604 --> 18:58.669
(screaming)

19:01.273 --> 19:03.241
Tell me I hit the right guy.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.447
Reports coming in
from all over the globe.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.816
Doom's network
is falling apart.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.351
So what happens next?

19:13.585 --> 19:16.320
You will make it right.
It's what heroes do.

19:16.755 --> 19:20.925
If thor goes back in time
and fixes things,
we won't have to.

19:21.293 --> 19:23.928
What's to stop doom from
just doing this over and over?

19:23.930 --> 19:27.899
Changing time again and again
and again until it sticks?

19:28.634 --> 19:31.602
Your science isn't
my strongest suit. Stark?

19:32.471 --> 19:35.840
You were off-world,
so you're immune to
whatever this thing does.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.875
We have to send you
back to the moment

19:37.877 --> 19:39.777
That doom first
activated this machine.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.345
That I do know.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.848
Heimdall sensed it from
the asgardian plane.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.317
Exactly midnight
here in new york.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.886
I'll program the
time-space coordinates.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.890
So what happens to us?
Do we cease to exist?

19:53.559 --> 19:56.427
No, falcon.
You will continue to be.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.929
As you have always been...

19:57.931 --> 19:59.564
Heroes.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.568
Falcon? Cool.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.639
Doom: All is ready!

20:08.941 --> 20:11.309
Activate the time platform.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.955
(screaming)

20:26.925 --> 20:28.659
(groans)

20:28.827 --> 20:30.328
Causal feedback loop.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.431
No! I planned for this.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.000
<i>Shall we recommence</i>
<i>the project?</i>

20:36.535 --> 20:38.803
We will not recommence!

20:40.606 --> 20:42.940
I've spent years
mining the materials,

20:42.942 --> 20:46.544
Perfecting the science,
only to find it useless.

20:47.646 --> 20:51.682
Finally.
Something you say
makes sense, doom.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.889
You almost
blew up the tower.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.858
I increased
the training levels.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.526
We all need to be
better prepared.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.862
Prepared to what?
Get squashed?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.030
Hawkeye:
Focus, people!

21:06.032 --> 21:08.833
Someone owes me
one ice cream maker.

21:08.835 --> 21:09.900
Not cool.

21:09.902 --> 21:13.804
Who touched my stuff?

21:14.439 --> 21:15.640
(thor laughs)

21:16.508 --> 21:18.476
Think this is funny,
goldilocks?

21:18.478 --> 21:20.011
Go back to asgard!

21:20.013 --> 21:22.747
What, hang with
a bunch of vikings?

21:22.749 --> 21:25.349
No, I think I'll stay
here where I belong.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.385
Among friends.
