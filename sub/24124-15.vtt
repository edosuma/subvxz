WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.500
take me, please?

00:45.500 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:20.458 --> 01:22.583
- Hiya, Rabbit!
-

01:25.375 --> 01:28.125
You could use a hand
with your handsome.

01:28.125 --> 01:31.000
But if you really
wanna see beautiful,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.958
tiggers are so beautiful
it hurts.

01:34.958 --> 01:36.458
You're telling me.

01:37.875 --> 01:39.583
If I was any better looking,

01:39.583 --> 01:42.416
you'd need two of me
to hold all that gorgeous.

01:42.416 --> 01:45.083
My public awaits.

01:49.083 --> 01:50.416
Whoa!

01:55.166 --> 01:58.583
Tigger, you broke the mirror.

01:58.583 --> 02:03.166
That means you'll have
seven years bad luck.

02:03.166 --> 02:06.125
Nah! It was only
a little mirror.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.125
I'll probably
just get seven days.

02:08.125 --> 02:11.250
Oh, no, no, no!
Seven years!

02:13.000 --> 02:15.125
Years?

02:15.125 --> 02:18.708
Oh, tiggers don't believe
in stupersitions!

02:18.708 --> 02:20.458
-

02:20.458 --> 02:23.166
Besides--

02:23.166 --> 02:25.500
...it wasn't my mirror.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.583
Oh, no.

02:27.583 --> 02:32.750
Yeah, bunny boy, it's you
who's in for the bad luck.

02:32.750 --> 02:36.458
Seven years? What'll I do?

02:36.458 --> 02:39.458
Oh, no! Oh, no!

02:39.458 --> 02:42.125
Don't worry those fuzzy,
little ears.

02:42.125 --> 02:44.375
Old Tigger will be
your bodyguard.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.166
I'll guard your body...

02:46.166 --> 02:49.000
from all the ill fortune
that's gonna befall it.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.875
Just have a seat

02:50.875 --> 02:53.458
in this nice, safe--

02:54.708 --> 02:56.416
Don't move.

02:56.416 --> 02:58.125
This chair's wobbly.

02:58.125 --> 03:00.250
Lucky thing I stopped you
from sitting.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.291
- You might have got hurt.
- Huh?

03:02.291 --> 03:04.166
Now, don't worry.

03:05.875 --> 03:07.875
I'll secure it.

03:07.875 --> 03:10.458
Tigger!

03:14.708 --> 03:17.500
Hmm, his bad luck

03:17.500 --> 03:20.000
is about a gazillion times
worse than I figured.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.625
Don't worry, long ears!

03:28.625 --> 03:32.000
We won't let another one
of these things drop
on your noggin.

03:34.208 --> 03:36.458
Hey, wait a minute!
This one's got a worm!

03:36.458 --> 03:39.333
Worms? In my prize-winning
apples?

03:39.333 --> 03:41.250
Yeah, right here. See?

03:41.250 --> 03:44.333
Tigger!

03:44.333 --> 03:46.291
That's no good, bunny boy!

03:46.291 --> 03:50.208
You can run from bad luck,
but you can't hide!

03:54.875 --> 03:57.000
Seven years.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.583
Seven years?

03:58.583 --> 04:00.083
I'll never make it.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.583
Ahh!

04:05.583 --> 04:06.958
Oh, at last.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.875
Bad luck can't find me here.

04:11.875 --> 04:14.875
- Bubbly bath?

04:14.875 --> 04:18.250
Rabbit, you're just
asking for disaster.

04:19.375 --> 04:20.708
Tigger!

04:20.708 --> 04:23.166
No!

04:23.166 --> 04:25.291
This isn't the answer,
bunny boy.

04:25.291 --> 04:28.083
You gotta come out
and face your troubles.

04:33.833 --> 04:36.625
How'd you get to be so good
at bad luck anyways?

04:40.416 --> 04:42.458
Come on up, long ears!

04:42.458 --> 04:45.583
This spot is 101% safe!

04:45.583 --> 04:49.250
You won't even need
that anti-bad luck think.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.583
Are you sure?

04:52.291 --> 04:53.708
Sure.

04:53.708 --> 04:55.875
Hmm.

04:55.875 --> 04:58.000
Just a harmless vegetable.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.625
But with the kind of luck
Rabbit's been having with
apples--

05:08.708 --> 05:12.000
Tigger, what are you doing?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm digging for Rabbit,
Pooh boy.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.375
Why, you're in luck.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.125
There's one now.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.708
Hello, Rabbit.

05:22.708 --> 05:25.333
I have just come
from your house

05:25.333 --> 05:27.375
where I was looking
for you,

05:27.375 --> 05:30.000
when I happened to find this.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.333
Rabbit: Seven whole years!

05:31.333 --> 05:35.000
But shouldn't I see me
in it?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.083
Or perhaps I've forgotten how
to use it since I loaned it
to you.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.416
Why yes, I forgot.

05:43.416 --> 05:45.375
It's Pooh's mirror.

05:48.291 --> 05:53.750
Oh, Pooh, I am so sorry.

05:53.750 --> 05:58.000
Seven years of bad luck.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.875
Oh, but--

05:59.875 --> 06:02.833
Now, don't worry,
you're safe with me.

06:02.833 --> 06:05.375
I'll protect you,

06:05.375 --> 06:07.083
same as I did Rabbit.

06:07.083 --> 06:10.208
Yes, and he's just
the tigger to do it.

06:10.208 --> 06:14.708
Why, I'd be a mess
if it weren't were for him.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.500
Oh, come on, Piglet,
it's only for seven years.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.500
But my shirt? Ooh! Whoa!

06:25.291 --> 06:27.458
Here, slip into this,
Pooh boy.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.125
Tigger, I'm confused.

06:34.125 --> 06:36.375
If you're confused,

06:36.375 --> 06:39.708
think how bamboozled
that bad luck will be.

06:39.708 --> 06:42.958
From here on out, Pooh,
you're Piglet.

06:42.958 --> 06:45.375
And Piglet, you're Pooh.

06:45.375 --> 06:46.583
Got it?

06:48.250 --> 06:51.708
Do Piglets such as myself
like honey?

06:51.708 --> 06:55.416
No, but Pooh bears do.

06:55.416 --> 06:58.458
- Alley-oops!
- Oh!

06:58.458 --> 07:01.250
Oh, d-d-dear.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.625
I wonder what that might be.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.750
Tigger: That is bad luck!

07:12.750 --> 07:14.416
Run!

07:14.416 --> 07:16.166
- Help, help.
- Help!

07:18.833 --> 07:21.833
Don't worry, Pooh,
I'll protect you!

07:34.958 --> 07:37.625
Pooh: Now, if I'm Piglet,
but he's Tigger,

07:37.625 --> 07:40.333
and you're Pooh,
then Rabbit must be--

07:40.333 --> 07:42.250
Rabbit: Keep quiet!

07:44.458 --> 07:46.458
Don't worry about a thing, Pooh.

07:46.458 --> 07:49.416
Or is it Piglet?

07:49.416 --> 07:52.458
You'll be absotutely,
posilutly safe in here.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.875
Do you really think so?

07:54.875 --> 07:59.458
You just stay here
for seven years
and you'll be fine.

07:59.458 --> 08:02.708
Oh, dear! Seven years?

08:02.708 --> 08:05.875
And don't open your door
for anyone.

08:08.166 --> 08:11.166
I put a bona fide lightning rod
up there.

08:11.166 --> 08:14.000
Now even lightning will
be afraid to come around.

08:15.166 --> 08:17.375
Let's see bad luck get in there.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.166
Well, that didn't work.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.833
This is outrageous.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.166
First me, then you,

08:32.166 --> 08:33.375
now Piglet.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.250
How can it be?

08:35.250 --> 08:36.708
We're just lucky.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.166
Don't worry, Piglet.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.458
I'm sure Tigger knows
what's wrong.

08:43.458 --> 08:47.166
After all, he was there
when all three of us--

08:47.166 --> 08:48.333
Tigger!

08:48.333 --> 08:50.375
You were with all of us!

08:50.375 --> 08:53.416
That's right, bunny boy.

08:53.416 --> 08:55.083
And if it hadn't have been
for me--

08:55.083 --> 08:56.833
If it hadn't been for you,

08:56.833 --> 08:58.333
none of this
would have happened,

08:58.333 --> 09:00.000
right, Piglet?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.708
There! You see?

09:01.708 --> 09:04.875
Tigger hasn't been following
bad luck around,

09:04.875 --> 09:07.125
it's been following him!

09:07.125 --> 09:09.291
You broke the mirror.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.000
The bad luck is yours!

09:15.875 --> 09:17.083
He's right.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.458
Oh, the pain, the agony,

09:21.458 --> 09:23.208
the bunions, the woe,

09:23.208 --> 09:25.291
the whoo,
the you know who.

09:25.291 --> 09:27.500
I'm gonna go away for awhile,

09:27.500 --> 09:30.583
say seven years.

09:30.583 --> 09:34.583
Tigger, what are you doing?

09:34.583 --> 09:37.875
Packing seven years worth
of stuff, for goodness sake.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.708
Mind if I borrow this,
bunny boy?

09:40.708 --> 09:44.875
- Now, Tigger--
- Don't try to stop me.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.250
- My bed!
- I must go alone.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.958
For the good of my fiends.

09:49.958 --> 09:53.416
It's not safe having
me around, you know.

09:53.416 --> 09:58.250
Me! I'm not even safe
being around myself.

09:58.250 --> 10:01.458
- But--
- Yeah.

10:01.458 --> 10:04.083
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

10:06.291 --> 10:10.166
We can't let him leave,
not for seven years!

10:10.166 --> 10:11.750
He'll miss my birthday.

10:14.583 --> 10:19.416
Boy, seven years stuck
in the middle of nowhere.

10:19.416 --> 10:22.000
This looks like
as good a place as any.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.333
Tigger! Oh, Tigger!

10:30.333 --> 10:34.125
Hey! What are you guys doing
in the middle of nowhere?

10:34.125 --> 10:38.750
We unbroke the mirror.

10:38.750 --> 10:41.750
It works!

10:41.750 --> 10:43.708
It's unbusticated!

10:43.708 --> 10:46.750
- It's me!
- Now you won't have to leave.

10:46.750 --> 10:52.291
That old bad luck
is just out of luck.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.000
P-P-Pooh!

10:54.000 --> 10:57.458
Why, welcome back, Piglet.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.000
Oh, Thank you.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.208
Christopher Robin:
Oh, no, no!

11:03.208 --> 11:06.875
A broken mirror
doesn't mean bad luck, Pooh.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.833
That's just a superstition.

11:08.833 --> 11:11.291
Oh, I know, Christopher Robin.

11:11.291 --> 11:12.708
I don't believe in--

11:14.875 --> 11:16.708
...in those things.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.750
I was just playing along

11:18.750 --> 11:22.625
so the bad luck
wouldn't feel bad.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.750
What are you
looking for, Pooh?

11:24.750 --> 11:28.625
I thought I might find
a four-leaf clover...

11:28.625 --> 11:29.625
just in case.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.833
Silly old bear.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.250
Christopher Robin!

11:51.250 --> 11:54.875
You know you can't skate
without your earmuffs on.

11:54.875 --> 11:57.333
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, Mom.

12:01.458 --> 12:06.583
Christopher Robin,
why can't you skate
without earmuffs?

12:06.583 --> 12:09.375
'Cause otherwise
his toes would get cold.

12:09.375 --> 12:12.958
Oh, no! I can skate
without my earmuffs.

12:12.958 --> 12:15.875
It's just I can't skate
without my earmuffs.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.583
You know how moms are.

12:19.708 --> 12:21.708
Ready?

12:21.708 --> 12:24.208
Ready! For what?

12:30.458 --> 12:32.208
Christopher Robin:
Watch out, Piglet!

12:32.208 --> 12:34.000
Tigger: Gangway!

12:34.000 --> 12:36.166
Oh, hello, Piglet.

12:36.166 --> 12:38.333
Nice of you to drop in.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.708
Hello, Pooh.

12:39.708 --> 12:43.083
Where are we going
so very quickly?

12:43.083 --> 12:45.458
Why, we're going skating.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.458
Skating?

12:47.458 --> 12:50.291
Last one on the ice is...

12:50.291 --> 12:51.458
last one on the ice!

13:07.125 --> 13:09.625
The ice seems
particularly cold today.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.875
Perhaps if I waited
till it got warmer.

13:11.875 --> 13:16.833
Hurry up, Piglet!
You're missing all the fun.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.000
Huh! Tourists!

13:26.875 --> 13:29.375
Hey, anybody wanna play
ice cookie?

13:29.375 --> 13:32.375
Isn't that ice hockey, Roo?

13:32.375 --> 13:34.875
No, we're out of hockey pucks.

13:34.875 --> 13:37.000
But Mama gave me
an oatmeal cookie.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
I'll be captain
of the winning team.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.750
And Christopher Robin,
you can be captain
of the other one.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.458
Pick me, Tigger! Pick me!

13:47.458 --> 13:50.875
Hmm. I pick Roo.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.708
- Pooh!
- Eyeore!

13:52.708 --> 13:54.500
- Rabbit!
- Owl!

13:54.500 --> 13:56.000
- Piglet!
- Oh, dear!

14:00.000 --> 14:02.458
- Oh, bother.
- Come on, Piglet!

14:02.458 --> 14:04.416
We need you!

14:04.416 --> 14:07.250
Oh, I can't really.

14:07.250 --> 14:10.000
I have to mow my lawn.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.875
But, Piglet, it's winter.

14:12.875 --> 14:16.833
Well, there's no use waiting
until the last minute.

14:16.833 --> 14:19.166
I wonder what's wrong
with Piglet.

14:19.166 --> 14:21.416
- Perhaps I'd better find out.
-

14:21.416 --> 14:24.208
Okay! Let's whack that cookie!

14:26.375 --> 14:27.625
Rabbit: I got it!

14:29.500 --> 14:30.625
Roo: I think I got it!

14:32.875 --> 14:34.166
Yay!

14:42.291 --> 14:44.708
Whoo! I say!

14:51.000 --> 14:52.125
Hurrah.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.750
If only I knew how to skate.

15:08.750 --> 15:12.250
Pooh: Piglet,
isn't your yard that way?

15:12.250 --> 15:15.458
Why, Pooh,
what are you doing up here?

15:15.458 --> 15:18.583
I've come to ask...

15:18.583 --> 15:21.083
What are you doing
up here, Piglet?

15:21.083 --> 15:23.166
I'm up here because I--

15:23.166 --> 15:26.458
because I can't--
I can't skate!

15:26.458 --> 15:27.708
Oh!

15:44.583 --> 15:47.083
Oh, dear!

15:51.708 --> 15:55.625
- One point for Piglet's team!

15:55.625 --> 15:57.333
Whichever that is.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.333
Hello, Piglet.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.708
Finish mowing your lawn already?

16:01.708 --> 16:06.000
He wasn't really mowing
his lawn, Christopher Robin.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.083
Why, Piglet, what's the matter?

16:09.083 --> 16:11.833
You see, he can't skate.

16:11.833 --> 16:14.583
And he feels terribly ashamed.

16:14.583 --> 16:17.291
Don't worry, Piglet,
we'll teach you.

16:18.625 --> 16:21.291
But, Christopher Robin,
I can't do it.

16:21.291 --> 16:23.458
I know I can't.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.583
Of course you can, Piglet.

16:25.583 --> 16:29.333
It's just like walking,
only not.

16:29.333 --> 16:33.166
Well, this isn't
so entirely bad.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.333
You see, Piglet?

16:35.333 --> 16:36.750
You can do it.

16:44.583 --> 16:46.500
Oh, dear! Oh!

16:46.500 --> 16:48.333
Oh!

16:49.583 --> 16:51.458
He caught one.

16:51.458 --> 16:56.208
So what kind of bait
do you use?

16:56.208 --> 16:59.000
Spread out.
Let me have a crack at him.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.458
I'll have him skating
quicker than you can say

17:01.458 --> 17:03.708
Ticonderogia!

17:03.708 --> 17:07.000
If you can say Ticonderogia!

17:08.833 --> 17:11.416
You see, the trouble is
the little skates

17:11.416 --> 17:13.333
on the little guy's
little feet.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.166
They're just too little.

17:15.166 --> 17:19.000
Perhaps I might try learning
a bit later.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.833
Say around summertime?

17:20.833 --> 17:23.708
There, there, Piglet.
Be brave.

17:23.708 --> 17:26.708
These king-size super skates
will do the trick.

17:26.708 --> 17:29.833
I don't think this is
a good idea.

17:29.833 --> 17:31.708
Good?

17:31.708 --> 17:33.625
Why, it's downright superfluous.

17:33.625 --> 17:36.083
Yaah!

17:36.083 --> 17:38.875
Oh, I say, I'm impressed.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.625
Reminds me of the time
my cousin Torbek shot

17:41.625 --> 17:44.208
an armadillo out of a catapult.

17:44.208 --> 17:47.083
-

17:47.083 --> 17:50.458
Why, exactly what he said.

17:52.875 --> 17:55.083
Well, that didn't work.

17:55.083 --> 17:59.083
Christopher Robin,
I believe I have an idea...

17:59.083 --> 18:02.208
or something like one.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.583
What is it, Pooh?

18:04.583 --> 18:07.875
- Your earmuffs.
- My earmuffs?

18:07.875 --> 18:11.875
Your mother said you couldn't
skate without your earmuffs,

18:11.875 --> 18:15.708
so perhaps Piglet
could borrow them?

18:15.708 --> 18:19.000
Yes! We'll give Piglet
my earmuffs.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.083
That's a wonderful idea.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.875
I rather thought so.

18:24.875 --> 18:28.166
Christopher Robin, do you mean
if I wear these earmuffs,

18:28.166 --> 18:30.250
I'll e be able to skate?

18:30.250 --> 18:34.125
Yes, Piglet.
These earmuffs are magic.

18:38.333 --> 18:41.250
Christopher Robin:
First your right foot,
then your left.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.625
Right, left.

18:43.625 --> 18:47.166
- Good!
- I can skate.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.000
I can skate!

18:49.000 --> 18:51.875
The earmuffs really do work!

18:51.875 --> 18:54.500
In a little while,
I'll be ready to play
ice cookie.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.416
It's ice honey now.

18:57.416 --> 18:59.458
Eyeore ate the puck,

18:59.458 --> 19:02.166
so Rabbit brought
a jaw for us to use.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.208
Come on! We better hurry!

19:04.208 --> 19:05.833
They'll start without us!

19:09.958 --> 19:12.333
Christopher Robin:
Oh, that was some game.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.750
Tigger: Yeah! And tomorrow
we got to break the tie!

19:14.750 --> 19:18.166
Ta-ta, all.
Until tomorrow.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.833
Yeah, I better be going, too.

19:19.833 --> 19:22.291
Bye, everybody.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.166
Pooh: Why, Rabbit, we almost
forgot your honey jar.

19:25.166 --> 19:30.333
Perhaps there's still a small
lowly smackerel left in it?

19:30.333 --> 19:32.625
Oh, bother.

19:32.625 --> 19:37.458
Now, Pooh bear, you know
you shouldn't go on
the ice without skates.

19:37.458 --> 19:40.375
We better go out and get him.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.083
Roo: Help! Mama!

19:52.083 --> 19:54.208
Oh, dear! What was that?

19:57.375 --> 20:01.083
Say, isn't it a little foolhardy
heading downstream?

20:01.083 --> 20:05.708
Don't you know there's
a waterfall over there?

20:09.083 --> 20:11.333
Piglet!

20:11.333 --> 20:15.458
- What, Pooh?
- Our skates!

20:15.458 --> 20:20.000
Don't worry!
I'll save you s-s-somehow!

20:20.000 --> 20:24.250
I almost forgot
my magic earmuffs.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.958
Oh, my! The magic earmuffs!

20:55.750 --> 20:57.291
Piglet!

20:59.750 --> 21:02.625
Without my earmuffs,
I'm doomed!

21:05.583 --> 21:10.000
Tigger: Piglet!
You're going the wrong way!

21:10.000 --> 21:13.583
But I have to get those earmuffs
if I'm going to skate.

21:13.583 --> 21:16.708
But Piglet,
aren't you skating now?

21:20.708 --> 21:23.000
Yes, I was skating, wasn't I?

21:27.708 --> 21:29.333
Oh, d-d-dear!

21:44.250 --> 21:47.166
Is it over?

21:47.166 --> 21:51.250
You see, Piglet, you never
needed those earmuffs at all.

21:51.250 --> 21:55.000
Yeah! All you needed was
a little practicing.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
And a little confidence.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.750
Isn't it wonderful
that I became such
a very fine skater

22:01.750 --> 22:04.833
- just as-- just as--
-

22:04.833 --> 22:08.291
Just as the spring thaws,
as in.
