MAN WITH A PLAN #201
"The Silver Fox"
Closed Captioned

00:02.836 --> 00:04.205
ADAM:
You got us going to the opera

00:04.238 --> 00:06.274
three nights in a row?

00:06.307 --> 00:10.178
Just tell me what I did wrong,
and I won't do it again.

00:10.211 --> 00:13.114
No, no. It's an arts festival,
all right?

00:13.147 --> 00:15.316
The first night is opera,
the second night is ballet,

00:15.349 --> 00:17.351
and then the third night is

00:17.385 --> 00:19.053
(under breath):
jazz poetry.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.756
Did you say
"jazz poetry"?

00:22.790 --> 00:25.193
Listen, I-I watched
this Oprah thing

00:25.226 --> 00:27.361
about how exposing yourself
to the fine arts

00:27.395 --> 00:31.332
can maximize
your life's potential.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.801
You ever notice Oprah
doesn't have a husband?

00:35.369 --> 00:38.406
Mom, you have to
return this shirt.

00:38.439 --> 00:41.309
Tiffany from school said
it was offensively boring.

00:41.342 --> 00:45.279
Andi, Katie doesn't like
her shirt. We can't go out.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.781
Here's what you do;
you look Tiffany

00:47.815 --> 00:49.417
straight in the eye,
and you say,

00:49.450 --> 00:51.285
"It doesn't matter what I wear

00:51.319 --> 00:55.289
because there's a candle in me
that no wind can blow out."

00:55.323 --> 00:57.258
Sure, I'll say that

00:57.291 --> 00:58.726
if you tell me what school
you're transferring me to.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.161
Oh.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.262
(doorbell rings)

01:01.295 --> 01:02.363
Oh, guys, that's
the babysitter.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.268
Hi.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.537
I'm sorry, uh, I think you're
in the wrong neighborhood.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.539
Are you looking
for Coachella?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.374
Adam, this is Sophia.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.842
She volunteers down
at the hospital.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.311
Oh.
Hi. You must be Emme.

01:17.345 --> 01:20.481
I'm the cute one you're not
gonna be able to say no to.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.151
(laughs)
I was just thinking that.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.885
I'm Ted. What's up, girl?

01:24.918 --> 01:27.488
Don't say that.

01:27.521 --> 01:30.424
You said it was a good line
for picking up babes.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.826
Don't say that, either.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.862
Uh, come on in.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.364
Awesome.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.668
And, Andi, come on out.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.805
J-Just one...
(chuckles)

01:44.838 --> 01:47.475
What have you brought
into our home?

01:47.508 --> 01:49.377
What's wrong with Sophia?

01:49.410 --> 01:51.745
Oh, come on. What does she
do down at the hospital?

01:51.779 --> 01:54.915
Just walk around and give
people a reason to live?

01:54.948 --> 01:58.386
Plus, I thought Katie
was our babysitter now.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.388
Well, yeah, but this is
three school nights in a row.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.656
And I knew Kate would be mad
if I got a sitter,

02:02.690 --> 02:05.426
so I got a young, cool one
that she'd like.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.195
Andi, you made a
rule in this house

02:07.228 --> 02:08.762
that we would never
hire hot babysitters.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.465
You said, "No one
above a six."

02:12.333 --> 02:14.302
She's a 60.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.171
Yes, Adam, there was a time
that I didn't want

02:17.205 --> 02:20.308
a young, hot girl hanging
around my husband, but...

02:20.341 --> 02:21.675
it's fine now.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.615
What is that
supposed to mean?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.417
You know,
we're getting older...

02:29.450 --> 02:31.852
Okay, don't
include me in that.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.454
I am not getting older.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.224
I am maturing
into a silver fox.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.525
Okay? And what is
more attractive

02:37.558 --> 02:40.528
to a young woman
than a silver fox?

02:40.561 --> 02:43.431
A young, healthy fox?

02:43.464 --> 02:47.301
Andi, the dad and
the hot babysitter?

02:47.335 --> 02:50.404
That's the premise of,
like, every good movie.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.508
Alpha male providing
for his family.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.511
Young minx sees
that, wants that,

02:57.545 --> 02:59.380
decides to kill the wife

02:59.413 --> 03:02.850
and make new babies
with Mr. Alpha.

03:02.883 --> 03:06.454
It's a whole aisle
at the video store.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.588
Okay, well, I'm gonna say,

03:07.621 --> 03:09.290
if you think
there's still video stores,

03:09.323 --> 03:10.391
I got nothing
to worry about.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.763
They make these
babysitter movies

03:15.796 --> 03:17.765
because it's a real thing.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.301
Let me tell you something,
I've been getting looks

03:20.334 --> 03:23.537
from babysitters since...
I was babysat.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.573
(opera music playing)

03:31.612 --> 03:34.748
She drags me to this thing
and now she's sleeping?

03:34.782 --> 03:37.985
She is gonna pay for this.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.787
Oh, yeah.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.325
So, how'd it go?

03:44.358 --> 03:45.559
Oh, the kids were great.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.561
You know, I think
it's so sweet that Teddy

03:47.595 --> 03:50.698
wanted to sit on my lap
and get rocked to sleep.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.470
Not a bad move, actually.

03:56.504 --> 04:00.708
Well, the opera
was amazing, okay?

04:04.445 --> 04:08.816
I... feel like
a changed woman, you know?

04:08.849 --> 04:10.284
ADAM:
All right.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.687
Well, we should
probably, uh, let you go.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.689
And, uh, listen,
if something comes up

04:15.723 --> 04:17.358
tomorrow night, last minute,

04:17.391 --> 04:19.360
and you can't make it,
I'll pay you double.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.495
(laughs)
You're hilarious.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.996
All right, see you tomorrow.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.032
Bye.
Bye.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.535
Did you hear that?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.704
She thinks I'm hilarious.

04:30.738 --> 04:33.374
It's starting.

04:33.407 --> 04:36.510
Okay, clearly I hit a nerve,

04:36.544 --> 04:38.579
but, you know, don't take it
personally, honey.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.280
I mean, I'm getting older, too.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.450
The stock boy
at the grocery store

04:42.483 --> 04:43.951
barely looks down
my shirt anymore.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.520
What stock boy? Brian?

04:46.554 --> 04:48.956
I bought a candy bar
for his stupid basketball team

04:48.989 --> 04:50.524
and he does me like this?

04:52.460 --> 04:53.627
Hey, where's Sophia?

04:53.661 --> 04:54.895
Oh, she just left.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.630
Ugh. I wanted
to show her...

04:59.633 --> 05:01.702
What happened to you?

05:01.735 --> 05:03.504
Uh... a little culture.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.106
She is radiant.

05:06.139 --> 05:10.043
Look, I just wanted to say
how awesome Sophia is.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.979
She's super cool
and really easy to talk to.

05:12.012 --> 05:15.383
Ah, I knew it. See?

05:15.416 --> 05:20.521
I think moms are a little cooler
than you give us credit for.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.524
Uh, honey, you got a little,
uh, a little...

05:23.557 --> 05:24.858
a little something
on your...
What? What?

05:24.892 --> 05:26.894
...a little something
right there.
Where?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.431
(gasps)
Adam!

05:31.932 --> 05:33.934
I'm not even sorry, seÃ±or.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.606
*

05:46.780 --> 05:48.549
And then Andi
basically says I'm too old

05:48.582 --> 05:50.884
to be attractive
to the hot babysitter.

05:50.918 --> 05:54.488
That's crazy.
It's the babysitter and the dad.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.091
Has Andi never been
to the video store?

05:58.125 --> 05:59.893
That's what I said.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.562
By the way,

06:01.595 --> 06:03.831
there's no more video
stores. Get with it, man.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.601
Well, thank you for drawing

06:07.635 --> 06:09.670
a semi-permanent mustache
on my face.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.640
Kept trying to rub it off,

06:12.673 --> 06:14.808
but it just looked like
I was stroking it.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.711
Hey, you were sleeping
with your mouth open.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.613
You're lucky
I didn't black out a tooth.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.715
No, you didn't do that
because I fell asleep.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.484
You did it
because of what I said

06:23.517 --> 06:24.618
about you and the babysitter.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.654
Oh.
Oh, that's
definitely why.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.756
He was just
talking about it.

06:33.561 --> 06:34.962
Okay, well, enjoy the ballet.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.064
I'll just be stuck at home
watching the playoffs.

06:42.670 --> 06:46.206
Kate, why did you cut up
your new shirt?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.108
Oh, Sophia said to beat Tiffany
at her own game

06:48.141 --> 06:49.877
by making it cooler
than anything she wears.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.211
But I bought one, too.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.647
We were twinsies.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.015
Well, you're not cutting up
your shirt.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.451
Stock Boy Brian is getting
an eyeful as it is.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.589
Oh, and, uh, you don't have to
make dinner for me and Sophia.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.856
She's bringing sushi.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.092
I'm always trying
to get you to eat sushi.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.560
You said you hate it.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.896
Sophia said I'd like it.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.032
I said you'd like it.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.634
But then Sophia said it.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.071
Did you hear that?

07:18.105 --> 07:19.940
She's gonna try sushi
for Sophia?

07:21.008 --> 07:24.778
Hope Sophia gets a chopstick
in the eye.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.146
Way to rise above it.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.650
(sniffs)

07:29.683 --> 07:32.085
You smell that? What is that?

07:32.119 --> 07:34.755
Hey, Dad,
Sophia's gonna be here soon.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.756
How much cologne is too much?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.861
You nailed it, buddy.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.533
I don't see why
you're so bent out of shape.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.067
I thought the whole reason
you hired Sophia

07:47.100 --> 07:48.802
was so that Katie
would like her.

07:48.836 --> 07:49.937
It was.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.238
And that's what happened.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.240
I know.

07:53.273 --> 07:57.177
But now you seem mad.
Oh, I'm mad.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.646
Take it easy.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.047
I mean, I-I'd go
get you a wine,

08:00.080 --> 08:03.283
but it's $17, and if I go,
I'm not coming back.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.053
You know what?
Sophia needs to be told

08:06.086 --> 08:07.621
that there are boundaries.

08:07.655 --> 08:11.291
Right? And I would like
for you to do that.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.194
All right, I'll talk to her,
but I think you're overreacting.

08:14.227 --> 08:17.297
I am not. I give Kate
advice, all right?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.733
Not some hotsy-totsy
babysitter.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.269
All right, her only job
is to heat up Hot Pockets,

08:22.302 --> 08:24.872
give Teddy some cheap
thrills and get out.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.510
What? We're not
ballet people.

08:34.047 --> 08:34.782
Hey.

08:34.815 --> 08:35.916
How was night two?

08:35.949 --> 08:38.786
Better, yeah.
We both fell asleep.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.023
Kate, you're still up
gabbing with your gal pal.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.993
That's great. I love to
see you two getting along.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.027
(Andi chuckles)

08:47.060 --> 08:48.195
Adam.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.563
What?

08:49.597 --> 08:50.564
Adam.

08:50.598 --> 08:51.565
What?

08:51.599 --> 08:52.766
Adam.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.267
Am I not saying, "What?"

08:54.301 --> 08:56.704
I hear myself
saying, "What?"

08:56.737 --> 08:59.707
Oh, my God, we are
having such a blast.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.341
Sophia Instagrammed a
picture of my new top

09:01.374 --> 09:02.910
and everyone liked it.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.012
So, Tiffany had to.
It was total domination.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.814
Mm-hmm. We owned her.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.016
Give it up, girl.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.918
(chuckles)

09:10.951 --> 09:14.021
I love the new secret
handshake, and I...

09:14.054 --> 09:15.923
and-and I-I'm glad
that Sophia's advice

09:15.956 --> 09:17.825
worked out for you. Adam!

09:17.858 --> 09:20.027
Oh! Okay, okay.
I gotcha, I gotcha.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.862
Uh, come on, honey. Let's
get you to bed. Come on.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.963
See you tomorrow.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.197
Can't wait.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.701
Okay, keep it moving.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.202
All righty, here you go.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.639
Thank you.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.808
Uh, actually, uh,
now that we're alone,

09:34.842 --> 09:37.878
we need to have a talk
about boundaries.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.813
The wife's a little upset.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.815
Oh.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.784
Well, then,
I guess I'll just have

09:43.817 --> 09:45.919
to try to behave
myself around you.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.325
Wh-Who? Me?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.827
Me, me?

09:53.861 --> 09:56.764
You know what I mean.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.199
I knew it!

09:59.232 --> 10:00.668
(chuckles):
Oh, my gosh.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.736
You are just ridiculous.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.705
(stammering):
O-Okay.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.174
(chuckling):
Yeah, well, you...

10:07.207 --> 10:11.011
That's, uh, that's me,
ridiculous. Okay.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.781
See you tomorrow.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.985
Yeah.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.386
Buh-bye.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.401
The silver fox.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.446
So, did you talk to Sophia
about the boundaries?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.849
Oh, I did.
And what I learned is,

10:48.882 --> 10:51.885
there is no boundary strong
enough to protect her

10:51.919 --> 10:55.455
from my overwhelming
silver foxiness.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.925
What?

10:57.958 --> 10:59.359
Okay, so what exactly happened?

10:59.392 --> 11:01.729
She said, and I quote,

11:01.762 --> 11:04.865
"Oh, my gosh,
you are just ridiculous."

11:07.901 --> 11:10.270
Is this the intermission,
or is that the whole story?

11:10.303 --> 11:12.439
Okay, how about this?

11:12.472 --> 11:15.142
When she was leaving,
she said, "See you tomorrow."

11:15.175 --> 11:18.178
And her eyebrows were going
all over her face, like this.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.481
Okay, Adam, I believe

11:21.514 --> 11:24.117
that you believe
something happened.

11:24.151 --> 11:27.054
I'm telling you, this girl is
well on her way to killing you

11:27.087 --> 11:29.289
and making me give her babies.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.958
I'm gonna roll the dice
on that one.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.126
Fine.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.128
But when you're a ghost
floating over the bed,

11:35.162 --> 11:37.697
watching us make babies,
you'll be sorry!

11:45.238 --> 11:46.339
ADAM:
Andi doesn't believe me,

11:46.373 --> 11:47.741
but I'm telling you,
I was getting

11:47.775 --> 11:49.743
major vibes from the babysitter.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.711
She was eye-snacking me.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.015
All the ladies love Adam.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.217
I went to froyo with him,
and the girl behind the counter

11:57.250 --> 12:00.120
upgraded him to a waffle cone,
no charge.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.091
She wouldn't even give me
a water cup.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.460
Enjoy your youth, son.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.430
I used to be a porch light
for every moth in town.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.300
I think this whole thing
is a sign

12:13.333 --> 12:17.037
that Andi and I are getting
complacent in our marriage.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.273
I drew a mustache on my own wife
like she was a drinking buddy.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.443
I wouldn't have done that
five years ago.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.278
Well, I don't know,
everybody says

12:25.312 --> 12:27.014
the best time in a
marriage is when you get

12:27.047 --> 12:28.348
really comfortable
with each other.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.117
Well, everybody is wrong.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.020
Okay. You know what every
marriage really needs?

12:33.053 --> 12:35.856
Trust?
Trust? No. Gross.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.458
No, the thing that keeps
the romance alive

12:38.491 --> 12:39.993
in a marriage is fear.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.830
Both people need to think
they got someone better

12:42.863 --> 12:45.799
than they deserve, so they bust
their butts to hang on.

12:45.833 --> 12:49.202
Fear is the...
the special sauce.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.138
Fear, huh?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.006
Now, does this
special sauce work

12:53.040 --> 12:54.774
if only the husband is scared?

12:55.943 --> 12:57.410
I'm asking for a friend.

13:01.014 --> 13:05.886
Honey, I want to apologize
for the jazz poetry.

13:05.919 --> 13:09.389
Yeah, why would anyone put those
two terrible things together?

13:09.422 --> 13:12.359
It's like getting a root canal
during a colonoscopy.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.127
(both laugh)
That's funny.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.831
I'm-- You know, I'm afraid
to even go in there.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.000
I mean, if Kate and Sophia
have another new handshake,

13:20.033 --> 13:22.069
I'm gonna start pulling hair.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.604
Andi, the big deal isn't
what Sophia's doing with Katie,

13:24.637 --> 13:26.940
it's what Sophia wants to do
with Mr. Alpha.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.075
And I'm gonna
prove it to you.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.609
So, buckle up, I am about to go

13:29.642 --> 13:31.278
full silver fox
on the babysitter.

13:31.311 --> 13:35.916
Wait. Are you the silver fox
or are you Mr. Alpha?

13:35.949 --> 13:38.952
I'm alpha silver fox.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.854
This is for you, baby, okay?

13:40.888 --> 13:42.022
No, Adam, wait.
No, no.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.191
You just watch her eyebrows.
They tell the whole story.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.995
Hey.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.930
You survived jazz poetry.
How was it?

13:49.963 --> 13:53.400
Ugh. It was like getting a
root canal during a colonoscopy.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.035
(chuckles)

13:55.068 --> 13:58.138
A colonoscopy.
I think my dad had one of those.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.441
Okay, why don't we just,
uh, pay Sophia

14:01.474 --> 14:03.010
and let her go on her way?

14:03.043 --> 14:05.512
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure.
But first, let me just,

14:05.545 --> 14:07.547
uh, get this jacket off--
it's so tight.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.516
(groans)

14:09.549 --> 14:10.984
When you swing a hammer
for a living,

14:11.018 --> 14:12.552
everything gets
bigger and stronger...

14:15.923 --> 14:17.057
Adam, you really don't
have to do this.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.225
No, no, no.
Open the window.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.626
I'm about to turn up the heat.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.530
Oh, hey, Sophia,

14:23.563 --> 14:24.965
look at that.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.499
Emme left her doll on the floor.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.634
I'll-I'll get it.

14:27.667 --> 14:31.371
I guess I'll just bend over--
probably the best way.

14:43.216 --> 14:47.054
Okay. Okay, Magic Mike,
show's over.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.422
Hey, my roommate

14:49.456 --> 14:51.358
just texted me and said
that she can't pick me up.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.060
Is there any way
I could catch a ride home?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.162
Oh, yeah, sure.
Adam can take you.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.665
For what it's worth,
I liked your moves.

15:01.268 --> 15:01.701
Night.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.635
Night.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.274
What are you doing to me?

15:07.307 --> 15:09.676
I was dying when you were
showing off your arms.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.245
What? Where were the eyebrows?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.647
You were in a coma over there.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.016
You talked to me
about boundaries,

15:16.049 --> 15:17.217
and your wife was right there.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.551
Well...

15:18.585 --> 15:20.720
But she won't be
on the ride home.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.923
It'll just be you and me
and those arms.

15:24.724 --> 15:25.692
I'll be waiting in the car.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.327
Okay.
(chuckles)

15:31.731 --> 15:34.101
Uh-oh.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.236
I was too sexy.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.674
I need a Tums.

15:41.708 --> 15:45.112
Andi, you need to come
downstairs now.

15:45.145 --> 15:48.015
What's wrong?
Alpha silver fox
is being hunted!

15:52.452 --> 15:54.654
There's been
an escalation.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.224
Sophia is gonna
jump me in the car.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.691
You have to
drive her home.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.261
What? Adam, I...

16:01.294 --> 16:05.198
Oh, I know what this is.

16:05.232 --> 16:08.001
You're having a midlife crisis.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.370
No, no, no.
That's not it.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.039
No, it happens
to everyone, okay?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.241
We just have to cheer you up.
Do you want a tattoo?

16:15.742 --> 16:18.511
Or a Jet Ski? Hmm?

16:18.545 --> 16:21.148
I don't get it. I-I'm telling
you this girl's into me,

16:21.181 --> 16:23.350
and you're sending me off
into the night with her.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.518
(scoffs) Meanwhile,
Katie tries sushi,

16:25.552 --> 16:28.555
and you get jealous and make me
have talks about boundaries.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.790
Let me tell you something,
Katie is 15 years old.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.659
It's normal for her
to ignore her mother

16:32.692 --> 16:34.227
and take advice from a friend.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.196
Did you listen to your mother
when you were 15?

16:36.229 --> 16:39.199
Oh, hell no.
I'd still have a perm.

16:39.232 --> 16:42.535
Exactly. And that's normal.
And thank God.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.536
Yeah.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.671
But what's not
normal is

16:44.704 --> 16:46.739
we are losing our special sauce.

16:46.773 --> 16:47.640
Our special what?

16:47.674 --> 16:50.777
Special sauce, Andi!
Our special sauce!

16:52.212 --> 16:54.547
If I tell you a girl is
making moves on me,

16:54.581 --> 16:56.249
you should care.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.686
You're right.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.089
Thank you.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.091
I did overreact about Kate.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.794
Are you kidding me?

17:07.827 --> 17:10.463
Fine. I'll
drive her home,

17:10.497 --> 17:12.732
but I am not responsible
for what happens.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.138
I'm not doing it!

17:22.209 --> 17:23.710
ANDI:
So, Sophia,

17:23.743 --> 17:26.479
last couple days, I've
been feeling a little...

17:26.513 --> 17:28.281
jealous.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.817
Uh-oh.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.819
And I know you had
a conversation

17:32.852 --> 17:34.854
with my husband
about boundaries.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.789
He told you about that?

17:36.823 --> 17:39.492
No, no, no, no, no.
I-I just wanted to tell you,

17:39.526 --> 17:40.560
I'm cool with it.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.630
Yeah, I mean, if it works
for the two of you,

17:43.663 --> 17:44.797
works for me.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.167
Wow.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.202
You're very open-minded.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.503
I know.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.739
In fact, I mean,

17:52.772 --> 17:54.774
I don't want to intrude,
but, um,

17:54.807 --> 17:57.477
it would be great
if sometime all three of us

17:57.510 --> 18:00.313
could be together
while you're doing your thing.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.849
You know, maybe I could
pick up some new tricks.

18:02.882 --> 18:06.486
I've never done that before,
but the more the merrier, I say.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.122
That's the spirit.
(laughs)

18:09.156 --> 18:10.790
We're gonna have
some fun, Sophia.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.760
Yeah, most wives aren't this
open to sharing their husbands.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.262
Well, yeah, you know--

18:15.295 --> 18:16.329
What now?

18:17.664 --> 18:19.866
You're leaving me
at the police station?

18:19.899 --> 18:21.868
I was gonna leave you
by the side of the road,

18:21.901 --> 18:23.870
but I'm a mother, and I wanted
you to get home safe.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.772
And you know what,
I'll tell you this.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.907
I don't need any help
in the bedroom, all right?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.843
I have been having sex
longer than you've been alive.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.315
And I should've stopped
talking, but I still win!

18:35.348 --> 18:37.617
What...?

18:37.650 --> 18:39.419
And then, I just
got crazy jealous,

18:39.452 --> 18:41.354
and I left her at
the police station.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.324
Ah, there's the special sauce.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.493
Huh?

18:46.526 --> 18:48.461
(chuckles):
Oh.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.597
Now, you were saying
there was some talk

18:50.630 --> 18:53.400
about some kind
of group thing?

18:55.402 --> 18:58.205
That's crazy. Right?

19:01.208 --> 19:02.542
Yes, it's crazy.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.212
That's what I said.
I didn't say anything else.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.348
I guess the really
good news is

19:08.381 --> 19:12.185
that I'm married to
the silver alpha fox.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.621
That's all I wanted to hear.
(chuckles)

19:17.957 --> 19:20.427
By the way,
it's "alpha silver fox."

19:25.865 --> 19:28.801
Get this. Sophia's Instagram
idea made Tiffany totally mad.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.870
Now she's having a party
and just posted a list

19:30.903 --> 19:33.206
of who's not invited-- look.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.809
"Not invited list:
O.J. Simpson,

19:36.843 --> 19:39.246
a ball of rats,
Katie Burns."

19:39.279 --> 19:42.882
Ooh. That's not a list
you want to be on.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.917
Sophia's plan totally backfired.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.757
Mom, what am I gonna do?

19:50.790 --> 19:54.561
Aw. I'm so glad you asked.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.430
Okay... but first,
l-let's do the thing.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.800
Seriously?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.869
Do the thing
with your mother.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.305
(giggles)

20:05.338 --> 20:07.474
Now we're handshake twinsies.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.677
Listen, it just so happens

20:10.710 --> 20:13.913
that the night of the party,
Lady Gaga's in town.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.915
So, what do you say
we go to that

20:15.948 --> 20:17.584
and Instagram
the heck out of it?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.452
I'm so down!
(laughing)

20:21.821 --> 20:24.491
Oh, and you don't have to
worry about Sophia anymore.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.293
You will never
see her again.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.794
Really? What happened?

20:27.827 --> 20:30.297
She hit on your dad.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.937
Gross.
(chuckles)

20:37.970 --> 20:39.872
She's, like, a hundred years
younger than you.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.374
(laughs)

20:46.713 --> 20:48.948
I would like the Jet Ski
to be red.
Okay.
