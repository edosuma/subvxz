WEBVTT

00:10.452 --> 00:12.185
Oh, boy.

00:12.287 --> 00:14.788
I feel like there's a man down here.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.590
He came and he bumped me.

00:16.692 --> 00:18.291
Like, you know, I felt it.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.860
Punching, slapping,
kicking. He's a bully.

00:20.963 --> 00:22.562
So, it's still an open case?

00:22.664 --> 00:24.531
Yes. It's an unsolved murder.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.633
I'm gonna [bleep] kill you.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.802
I've been through a lot in this house.

00:28.904 --> 00:30.470
He's kinda freaked out.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.539
They're everywhere.

00:32.641 --> 00:35.241
He's disgusting and nasty.

00:35.344 --> 00:37.877
There's a dark presence.

00:37.980 --> 00:40.280
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.382 --> 00:42.182
These things, they're freaking out.

00:42.284 --> 00:43.416
They're from hell.

00:43.518 --> 00:44.417
I see dead people.

00:44.519 --> 00:46.119
They were being hunted.

00:46.221 --> 00:47.854
I speak to dead people...

00:47.956 --> 00:50.023
They were setting people
on fire, burning them alive.

00:50.125 --> 00:51.424
...and they speak to me.

00:51.526 --> 00:52.792
Her neck got broken.

00:52.894 --> 00:56.162
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.064
And I hear a gunshot.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.600
- I rely on my partner.
- I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:00.702 --> 01:03.336
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.471
Somethin's not right here.

01:04.572 --> 01:08.008
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.543
- It's not safe here.
- It's my job to reveal them.

01:10.646 --> 01:12.012
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:12.114 --> 01:13.413
They're all buried here.

01:13.515 --> 01:15.281
But Steve and I never speak...

01:15.384 --> 01:17.317
We never communicate
during an investigation...

01:17.419 --> 01:19.419
- ...until the very end.
- I can't do it no more.

01:19.521 --> 01:21.755
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:21.857 --> 01:23.289
Holy [Bleep]. Look at this.

01:23.392 --> 01:24.724
Or time to get out.

01:24.826 --> 01:26.393
It does not have a happy ending.

01:26.495 --> 01:28.561
Something kills people here.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.477
I'm in the small town
of Canton, Illinois.

01:44.579 --> 01:46.980
It's between Chicago and St. Louis.

01:47.082 --> 01:48.882
Now, I got a call from a woman

01:48.984 --> 01:50.684
who said she's at her breaking point.

01:50.786 --> 01:52.919
Her 7-year-old
is so traumatized,

01:53.021 --> 01:54.888
he won't go anywhere alone in the house.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.923
She's says it's gotten physical,

01:57.025 --> 01:58.992
and she's afraid he's gonna get hurt.

01:59.094 --> 02:00.560
She's beggin' us for help.

02:06.768 --> 02:08.801
Before Amy arrives,

02:08.904 --> 02:11.871
I look for anything that
could influence her findings.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.775
This home is covered with family photos

02:15.877 --> 02:18.344
and spiritual items
that I need to remove.

02:21.450 --> 02:24.684
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.930
In... in my opening, I saw
two of these big trees...

02:38.333 --> 02:41.901
...and five shadow
men hanging from them.

02:43.839 --> 02:45.572
There's something that's, like,

02:45.674 --> 02:50.310
right outside here that is so bad.

02:50.412 --> 02:55.215
Like, there is this dark wall
of energy around this place

02:55.317 --> 02:58.785
because of whatever happened
to these five people,

02:58.887 --> 03:04.357
and they're creating this,
like, cloud of sadness.

03:04.459 --> 03:06.126
And they're creepy.

03:16.271 --> 03:18.571
When you and
I spoke the phone, uh,

03:18.673 --> 03:21.274
you sounded like a young
mom at her wit's end.

03:21.376 --> 03:23.109
Let's start. What the hell's goin' on?

03:23.211 --> 03:25.578
Um, I'm really worried about
my 7-year-old son, Layne.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.547
Things have been happening
in the house with him.

03:29.684 --> 03:31.751
Where he can't even sleep in
his room without, you know,

03:31.853 --> 03:33.052
four night-lights.

03:33.155 --> 03:34.420
I can tell, like, most of the time,

03:34.523 --> 03:36.589
Layne don't wanna be home
'cause he's terrified.

03:36.691 --> 03:38.525
Is everybody in the
house having experiences?

03:38.627 --> 03:40.126
- Yes.
- Okay, like what?

03:40.228 --> 03:43.429
There's banging going
on, um, things moving.

03:43.532 --> 03:46.766
Uh, we have seen
apparitions, shadow figures,

03:46.868 --> 03:48.701
and it has been physical.

03:48.804 --> 03:50.403
So, who exactly is living in the house?

03:50.505 --> 03:53.406
- Um, my husband, Mike...
- Okay.

03:53.508 --> 03:56.643
My son, Layne, and my
daughter, Hannelore.

03:56.745 --> 04:00.246
Layne is 7, and Hannelore
is about a year-and-a-half.

04:00.348 --> 04:02.081
I'm worried that Hannelore is starting

04:02.184 --> 04:05.185
to experience the same things
that Layne is experiencing.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.587
She'll point that the
window and say, "Uh-oh,"

04:07.689 --> 04:09.422
and... and kinda make a...

04:09.524 --> 04:11.791
like, a whining noise like she's scared.

04:11.893 --> 04:13.359
Now, you had mentioned that Layne

04:13.461 --> 04:14.527
is gettin' the worst of it.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.062
Yes. He gets upset.

04:16.164 --> 04:18.298
He hyperventilates when he sees things.

04:18.399 --> 04:21.134
Here's, um, a picture that he drew,

04:21.236 --> 04:23.236
and he said it was the devil
that he's seen in his room.

04:25.507 --> 04:27.774
He's got more pictures right here.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.615
This poor kid.

04:35.717 --> 04:39.419
He sees things that normal
7- year-olds don't see.

04:39.521 --> 04:42.522
One of the reasons I did take this case

04:42.624 --> 04:45.425
was because a child
was getting affected.

04:45.527 --> 04:48.628
Why do you think Layne's
being affected so much?

04:48.730 --> 04:49.863
I feel like they like him.

04:49.965 --> 04:52.031
They gravitate towards him.

04:52.133 --> 04:54.400
I mean, he says, "What do
they want? I want them gone."

04:54.502 --> 04:56.336
And then I'm... I don't
know what to tell him.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.772
I just want all of us
to be free and happy

04:59.875 --> 05:01.841
and not scared to be here.

05:01.943 --> 05:03.810
I don't know how much more I can take.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.011
Okay.

05:09.554 --> 05:14.691
I'm thinking that there
is a dead person here

05:14.793 --> 05:20.830
who is capable or wants to
inflict physical pain on people,

05:20.932 --> 05:25.068
or illness, uh, on living people.

05:29.341 --> 05:30.573
It's, like, in this room

05:30.675 --> 05:33.143
that I'm gettin' the big pull from him.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.445
This is where he retreated to,

05:35.547 --> 05:37.580
which kinda makes me nervous

05:37.682 --> 05:39.382
'cause it seems like
it's a child's room,

05:39.484 --> 05:41.518
so that's kind of unnerving.

05:42.687 --> 05:45.422
I'm getting, like,
this 20-year-old male.

05:45.524 --> 05:48.558
This dead guy, he
looks big. He's a bully.

05:48.660 --> 05:53.363
He can bully, um, you know,
weak people, vulnerable people.

05:53.465 --> 05:56.065
He's angry. He's very, very, very angry,

05:56.168 --> 06:02.172
and that does not bode well
for whoever might be in here.

06:08.079 --> 06:09.176
So what's goin' on in here?

06:09.548 --> 06:13.489
Um, I've seen shadow figures,
um, when I'm laying on the bed.

06:13.585 --> 06:15.852
Um, I have one that was in my face.

06:15.954 --> 06:18.855
I can feel them, on me, in my face.

06:18.957 --> 06:20.223
Like, watching me.

06:20.325 --> 06:21.424
You just said "them."

06:21.527 --> 06:22.792
- Yeah.
- Is there more than one?

06:22.895 --> 06:25.162
I did see another one
at a different time,

06:25.264 --> 06:26.897
and it was at the end of the bed.

06:26.999 --> 06:28.765
- Okay.
- And it was tall,

06:28.867 --> 06:31.768
and it was, like, just
standing there, watching me.

06:31.870 --> 06:32.802
Okay. Anything else?

06:32.905 --> 06:35.539
In the bathroom, it was late.

06:35.641 --> 06:40.043
I got in the shower, and I felt
like something was watching me.

06:40.145 --> 06:43.313
And it was, um, it made me feel,
like, violated, like, disgusted.

06:43.415 --> 06:44.781
I was disgusted.

06:44.883 --> 06:48.185
I opened the curtain,
and I was like, "Get out!"

06:48.287 --> 06:50.820
I knew it was there, and
as soon as I said that,

06:50.923 --> 06:53.423
I felt, like, "Okay, now I
can at least take a shower."

06:53.525 --> 06:54.991
So, you felt like a
Peepin' Tom or something?

06:55.093 --> 06:57.227
- Yes, definitely.
- Okay.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.467
I see, like, a woman with long hair.

07:04.570 --> 07:06.303
And this is a living person.

07:06.405 --> 07:08.438
And then, like, that guy.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.607
This guy is dead,

07:10.709 --> 07:13.643
and he's making moves on a living woman.

07:15.547 --> 07:19.816
This person, it's
like she's not herself.

07:19.918 --> 07:21.952
She's anxious and restless.

07:22.054 --> 07:24.154
She's, like, pacing.

07:24.256 --> 07:27.791
She's having, like, these,
like, weird, intrusive thoughts.

07:27.893 --> 07:29.659
Like, she wants to run away.

07:29.761 --> 07:32.762
She wants to leave this life.

07:32.864 --> 07:35.398
I- I mean, I think it might be this male

07:35.500 --> 07:37.133
who's, like, influencing her,

07:37.236 --> 07:39.035
but she's fighting
it, like, all the time.

07:39.137 --> 07:41.204
And that's, like, the
restlessness and the pacing

07:41.306 --> 07:43.473
and the can't sleep
and, like, the, you know,

07:43.575 --> 07:47.110
trying to, like, relax and, like, focus.

07:47.212 --> 07:49.145
He's, like, freaking out now
that I'm talking about it.

07:49.248 --> 07:51.314
He doesn't like it. He's
getting really anxious

07:51.416 --> 07:54.517
and really upset and he's just, like...

07:54.620 --> 07:56.152
Ow.

07:56.255 --> 07:57.721
My neck and my head.

08:04.429 --> 08:06.563
I hate being down here.

08:06.665 --> 08:08.431
It definitely creeps me out to be here.

08:08.533 --> 08:09.666
Okay. Why?

08:09.768 --> 08:11.401
When I have to come
down here and do laundry,

08:11.503 --> 08:14.337
I always feel like
somebody is watching me.

08:15.807 --> 08:16.973
I feel like it's a man.

08:17.075 --> 08:18.575
Is it the same feeling
you get in the bathroom?

08:18.677 --> 08:20.410
Yes. Exact same feeling.

08:20.512 --> 08:23.213
Every time I come down here,
I have the exact same feeling.

08:23.315 --> 08:24.514
Do you feel it right this second
while you're in front of me?

08:24.616 --> 08:25.682
Yes.

08:25.784 --> 08:27.150
- Now, where are you feelin' it?
- Right there.

08:27.252 --> 08:29.219
Okay.

08:29.321 --> 08:31.421
Recently he, um, came

08:31.523 --> 08:33.923
and he bumped me to get my attention.

08:34.025 --> 08:36.293
Like, he definitely
wanted me to feel him.

08:36.395 --> 08:38.861
- Do it to me.
- So it was like... that.

08:38.964 --> 08:40.330
Okay, so it was pretty significant.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.332
So it was, like... It,
like, you know, I felt it.

08:43.434 --> 08:44.734
I know you're a mom.
You gotta do laundry.

08:44.836 --> 08:46.469
But how the hell do you
come down here every day?

08:46.571 --> 08:48.204
I mean, I hate coming down here.

08:48.307 --> 08:50.674
I feel like I'm a
prisoner in my own home.

08:53.645 --> 08:55.979
I feel like
there's a man down here.

08:58.183 --> 09:00.850
Very, uh, aggressive male down here.

09:02.888 --> 09:04.120
Mm.

09:07.092 --> 09:10.894
He was an older male, uh,
probably, like, 50s, maybe?

09:10.996 --> 09:14.631
And he's a big guy.
Like, he's kinda chubby.

09:14.733 --> 09:16.333
I don't know how they would see him,

09:16.435 --> 09:19.602
but I think they could see something.

09:19.705 --> 09:22.672
He can be very aggressive
towards the living,

09:22.774 --> 09:25.175
'cause this is very
much his [bleep] space.

09:28.380 --> 09:29.679
What does he do to them?

09:29.781 --> 09:32.182
He likes to trip people a lot.

09:32.284 --> 09:35.452
Like, he'll kneel down and
wait and then grab them.

09:35.554 --> 09:37.620
He, like, rushes them.

09:39.124 --> 09:43.960
I think they'll see something,
like, barreling towards them,

09:44.062 --> 09:44.994
right up on them.

09:45.097 --> 09:47.197
He's just disgusting and nasty.

09:47.299 --> 09:48.965
I don't like him.

10:08.663 --> 10:11.197
So, Mike, it looks like you're
doing renovations, obviously.

10:11.299 --> 10:12.732
Yeah. Okay, so how long you...

10:12.834 --> 10:13.933
this been going on?

10:14.035 --> 10:15.702
Almost 5 years.

10:15.804 --> 10:17.303
- Five years?
- Yes.

10:17.405 --> 10:19.372
It takes so long 'cause
I'm uncomfortable up here.

10:19.474 --> 10:20.507
It really bothers me.

10:20.609 --> 10:22.675
What about your
experiences? What's goin' on?

10:22.777 --> 10:25.211
In the basement, we have
an old coal room down there,

10:25.313 --> 10:27.280
and when I was putting
together the pool table,

10:27.382 --> 10:29.349
I looked over and seen
an old man starin' at me

10:29.451 --> 10:30.583
through a plate glass window.

10:30.685 --> 10:31.885
Inside the coal room?

10:31.987 --> 10:33.686
Inside the coal room, you
know, just looking out.

10:33.788 --> 10:36.823
I probably sat there for 5...
5 minutes, just lookin' back.

10:36.925 --> 10:38.491
You know, your wife felt
something watching her

10:38.593 --> 10:39.626
from that window, too.

10:39.728 --> 10:41.094
So describe what the
old man looked like.

10:41.196 --> 10:42.929
All I seen was his
shoulders and his face,

10:43.031 --> 10:46.065
and he just looked old and
his face was just wrinkly.

10:46.168 --> 10:47.734
It freaked me out so
much that the next day,

10:47.836 --> 10:49.769
I went down with a can of spray paint,

10:49.871 --> 10:51.638
and I spray painted that window black.

10:51.740 --> 10:52.839
Okay. Anything else?

10:52.941 --> 10:54.340
Whenever I'm up here workin',

10:54.442 --> 10:56.009
overwhelming feeling
somebody's standin' right there

10:56.111 --> 10:57.443
in the doorway watchin' me.

10:57.546 --> 10:59.145
I cannot stop lookin' over my shoulder

10:59.247 --> 11:01.981
to see what's there, but
there's never anything there.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.316
You gettin' that feeling right now?

11:03.418 --> 11:04.484
Yeah. You do?

11:04.586 --> 11:05.785
And is it...
I've got a feeling

11:05.887 --> 11:07.187
that somebody's standing
right there, watching me.

11:07.289 --> 11:08.454
Okay.

11:11.293 --> 11:13.226
Oh, boy.

11:13.328 --> 11:14.360
I don't like in there though.

11:14.462 --> 11:17.664
It's terrible. It's terrible energy.

11:17.766 --> 11:20.333
Okay, so there's this old woman.

11:20.435 --> 11:23.102
She's, like, talking about, uh,

11:23.205 --> 11:24.971
somethin' up here, somebody.

11:25.073 --> 11:27.273
She does not like him.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.475
Would the living be
affected by this in any way?

11:29.578 --> 11:33.580
I would think yeah,
maybe feeling oppression.

11:33.682 --> 11:36.182
Maybe, like, an oppressive anxiety?

11:36.284 --> 11:38.718
And they feel her watching them.

11:41.823 --> 11:44.457
I don't like it in here.

11:44.559 --> 11:46.826
She would make the living feel sick.

11:46.928 --> 11:49.362
They would have, like,
intestinal issues.

11:49.464 --> 11:51.431
I don't like her. I don't
really want to talk to her.

11:51.533 --> 11:55.335
She is [bleep] so mean.

11:55.437 --> 11:58.471
She's like, "I'm gonna
[bleep] kill you!"

12:05.914 --> 12:07.146
How old are you now, Layne?

12:07.249 --> 12:09.082
- 7.
- Okay.

12:09.184 --> 12:11.251
I was talkin' to Mommy, and she
was telling was telling me that,

12:11.353 --> 12:12.919
uh, some of the things that
are happening in the house

12:13.021 --> 12:14.854
- make you afraid.
- Yes.

12:14.956 --> 12:16.923
Tell me about some of
the stuff you've seen.

12:17.025 --> 12:19.626
I hear children laughing,
a boy and a girl.

12:19.728 --> 12:21.761
And there was a guy right there.

12:21.863 --> 12:24.897
He was a black mass.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.100
There was an angel there.

12:27.202 --> 12:30.069
I saw floating dolls.

12:30.171 --> 12:35.508
They had stitch-up eyes
and it was really creepy.

12:35.610 --> 12:37.110
You know, I can believe
what I'm hearing.

12:37.212 --> 12:40.046
This kid is firing off
experience after experience

12:40.148 --> 12:42.815
to the point where I can barely keep up.

12:42.917 --> 12:45.151
I saw a black figure in the bathroom.

12:45.253 --> 12:47.654
It was, like, crunched down like this,

12:47.756 --> 12:50.356
and it was pretty creepy.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.859
Either Layne has an
overactive imagination

12:52.961 --> 12:55.962
or he's seen way too
much, way too young.

12:56.064 --> 12:57.130
I saw the devil.

12:57.232 --> 12:58.865
Okay, where'd you see the devil?

12:58.967 --> 13:01.067
Right here.

13:01.169 --> 13:02.335
Okay. Tell me about that.

13:02.437 --> 13:04.037
He had horns.

13:04.139 --> 13:05.238
What about his face?

13:05.340 --> 13:06.506
Red. Red.

13:06.608 --> 13:08.641
And he had black hair.

13:08.743 --> 13:11.744
He was, like, smiling so freaky at me.

13:11.846 --> 13:14.213
Okay. Is that the one you drew
the picture for, for Mommy?

13:14.316 --> 13:16.449
- Yes.
- How do you know it's the devil?

13:16.551 --> 13:17.717
I know it's the devil.

13:17.819 --> 13:20.353
I don't know why, but I know it's evil.

13:20.455 --> 13:22.989
How do you know all this?
You seem pretty smart.

13:23.091 --> 13:25.692
Thank you. 'Cause I'm just kind of open.

13:25.794 --> 13:28.394
Okay, so what do you think
these things your seeing want?

13:28.496 --> 13:29.829
They probably want to go to the light

13:29.931 --> 13:31.397
so they can go to heaven.

13:31.499 --> 13:34.133
So, do you think that when
people are bad in life,

13:34.235 --> 13:35.368
they go down?

13:35.470 --> 13:36.736
- Yes.
- Okay.

13:36.838 --> 13:38.137
And when you're a good
guy or a good girl you up?

13:38.239 --> 13:39.172
- Up.
- Yep.

13:39.274 --> 13:41.641
Okay. You're a good guy.

13:41.743 --> 13:42.775
- Thank you.
- Okay.

13:42.877 --> 13:44.577
- You are, too.
- Thank you.

13:44.679 --> 13:46.779
Appreciate that. All right.

13:46.881 --> 13:48.648
So it sounds like this stuff
is scaring you in the house.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.149
You don't want to be
here alone, I understand?

13:50.251 --> 13:53.219
Yeah, I've been through
a lot in this house.

13:53.321 --> 13:54.921
They're everywhere.

13:58.393 --> 14:00.593
I'm seeing the
younger dead guy again.

14:00.695 --> 14:01.694
This 20-year-old,

14:01.796 --> 14:04.397
he's squatting down in the closet.

14:04.499 --> 14:07.467
So I think, like, he might
be afraid of me a little bit.

14:07.569 --> 14:09.736
He feels like he can't hurt me,

14:09.838 --> 14:11.871
so he's, like, kind of freaked out.

14:13.308 --> 14:14.507
And he takes his
finger and he's, like...

14:17.579 --> 14:19.145
...doing this kind of stuff.

14:19.247 --> 14:23.850
And he's, like, laughing
'cause he knows it's disturbing.

14:23.952 --> 14:26.018
- So, the people hear that?
- Yes.

14:26.121 --> 14:28.521
It's like a spooky, creepy elf.

14:28.623 --> 14:31.624
And he's got, like,
sharp teeth, you know,

14:31.726 --> 14:33.926
um, and long nails.

14:34.028 --> 14:35.194
What does he do?

14:35.296 --> 14:40.333
He wants to physically harm...

14:40.435 --> 14:43.269
punching, slapping,
kicking, or make them sick.

14:43.371 --> 14:47.573
He can hurt vulnerable people.

14:47.675 --> 14:49.942
This is pretty... pretty serious.

15:02.820 --> 15:04.920
Mike and Angie didn't
know much about the history

15:05.022 --> 15:06.421
of their property,

15:06.523 --> 15:09.291
so I'm at the local library
to see what I can dig up.

15:09.393 --> 15:10.692
Searching through old records,

15:10.794 --> 15:14.463
I find a brutal rape and
murder of an 8-year-old girl.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.064
Turns out this sick, twisted crime

15:16.166 --> 15:19.801
happened less than a mile
from my client's house.

15:19.903 --> 15:22.571
I'm on my way to meet with
a criminal defense attorney

15:22.673 --> 15:25.641
who says the case remains
a mystery to this day.

15:31.081 --> 15:33.382
The 8-year-old girl
that was murdered

15:33.484 --> 15:35.384
right near my client's property,
what'd you find out about it?

15:35.486 --> 15:37.819
It was November 1955.

15:37.921 --> 15:40.689
Janice May went missing from her house.

15:40.791 --> 15:42.357
Her two brothers went lookin' for her.

15:42.459 --> 15:44.926
Uh, the family dog led
them to the rail road tracks,

15:45.029 --> 15:46.061
and next to the rail road tracks there

15:46.163 --> 15:48.930
was some abandoned mining cars.

15:49.033 --> 15:51.199
There, the brothers found
their sister shoved underneath

15:51.302 --> 15:52.768
one of the cars. Oh, you're kiddin' me.

15:52.870 --> 15:55.270
She had a terrible skull fracture

15:55.372 --> 15:56.972
on the right side of her face.

15:57.074 --> 15:58.240
- Okay.
- There was a concrete block

15:58.342 --> 16:00.075
sitting next to her with blood on it.

16:00.177 --> 16:02.144
She was half-nude.

16:02.246 --> 16:04.413
It was determined she
was sexually assaulted.

16:04.515 --> 16:06.048
Did the police make an arrest?

16:06.150 --> 16:08.650
The police interviewed
about 30 different suspects.

16:08.752 --> 16:10.919
Ultimately, they
focused on Lloyd Miller,

16:11.021 --> 16:13.088
a local taxi cab driver.

16:13.190 --> 16:15.490
It turned out that
right after this crime,

16:15.592 --> 16:16.992
he quickly fled town.

16:17.094 --> 16:21.029
They found Lloyd Miller in
a town 150 miles from Canton.

16:21.131 --> 16:22.264
He was at a bus station,

16:22.366 --> 16:25.434
trying to get a bus
ticket to go to Detroit.

16:25.536 --> 16:26.968
They brought him in for questioning.

16:27.071 --> 16:28.236
Miller denied involvement

16:28.339 --> 16:30.105
but after several days of interrogation,

16:30.207 --> 16:31.673
he ultimately confessed.

16:31.775 --> 16:32.974
What do we know about this guy?

16:33.077 --> 16:35.477
At this time, he was 29 years old.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.146
Miller completed the first
two years of high school,

16:38.248 --> 16:39.848
but then he was drafted in the military.

16:39.950 --> 16:42.150
He served in Italy durin' World War II.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.519
After he was discharged,
he came back to the States.

16:44.621 --> 16:46.755
And his dream was to become
an auto mechanic in Detroit.

16:46.857 --> 16:48.557
But he hopped around job to job.

16:48.659 --> 16:52.260
He ultimately joined the
Coast Guard, also the Army.

16:52.363 --> 16:54.429
But he went AWOL three separate times.

16:54.531 --> 16:56.565
He was sent to the stockade each time.

16:56.667 --> 16:57.733
Wow.

16:57.835 --> 16:59.701
He also got in trouble in California.

16:59.803 --> 17:02.170
For what? Uh, he and
a friend stole a car.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.473
He ended up spending 7
months in a prison farm.

17:04.575 --> 17:06.007
So this guy's all over the map.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.510
He was somewhat
unpredictable and impulsive.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.746
He got married four times,

17:10.848 --> 17:12.547
and a couple of these marriages

17:12.648 --> 17:15.050
to women he had only met
for the past few days.

17:15.152 --> 17:16.218
Who the hell does that?

17:16.319 --> 17:18.053
Sounds like a bit of a whack job.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.249
This 20-year-old,

17:23.351 --> 17:26.452
he doesn't like to think about
his life 'cause it was not good.

17:26.555 --> 17:28.054
It was very bad.

17:28.156 --> 17:29.389
He was a real tough guy.

17:29.491 --> 17:32.225
He was a bully when he was alive.

17:32.327 --> 17:35.428
He got... I think he
got thrown out of school.

17:35.530 --> 17:37.597
He was in and out of prison.

17:37.699 --> 17:39.532
And he hated his [bleep] mother.

17:39.634 --> 17:42.902
Wow. Like, real, like, [bleep] hate.

17:43.004 --> 17:45.939
I'm seeing like a garage...

17:47.509 --> 17:52.979
...and, like, wrenches and, um, oil.

17:53.081 --> 17:56.616
I wanna say he worked on
cars or something like this.

17:56.718 --> 17:58.384
He's freakin' out.

17:58.486 --> 18:01.187
All right, so how'd the trial go?

18:01.289 --> 18:02.722
The jury convicted him,

18:02.824 --> 18:05.358
and a judge sentenced him to
death by the electric chair.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.094
He had seven different execution dates.

18:08.196 --> 18:10.063
So, Dale, I noticed it
went to the Supreme Court.

18:10.165 --> 18:11.431
Do we know why?

18:11.533 --> 18:13.466
The defense team, throughout
these 10 years of appeals,

18:13.568 --> 18:16.202
started dismantling the state's case.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.504
The so-called confession
that Miller signed,

18:18.607 --> 18:19.706
he never wrote it.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.441
It was written by the police officers.

18:23.945 --> 18:25.945
In February 1967,

18:26.047 --> 18:29.182
the United States Supreme
Court overturned the conviction.

18:29.284 --> 18:31.684
And in March 20th, 1967,

18:31.786 --> 18:33.953
Miller walked out of
death row a free man.

18:34.055 --> 18:35.255
Do we know what happens to him?

18:35.357 --> 18:36.489
He moved to Mexico.

18:36.591 --> 18:38.625
He got remarried, again.

18:38.727 --> 18:41.361
Uh, he ended up writing a
book about his ordeals here.

18:41.463 --> 18:43.229
Um, he ultimately became a minister.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.964
Do we know if this
guy's still alive today?

18:45.066 --> 18:47.133
No, he's not. He died in 2013

18:47.235 --> 18:50.069
in Reading, Pennsylvania,
at the age of 86.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.739
Did cops back then ever
look into this case again

18:52.841 --> 18:55.541
and look at anybody else,
question anybody else about it?

18:55.644 --> 18:56.910
Not that we could tell.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.411
So it's still an open case?

18:58.513 --> 19:00.246
Yes, it's an unsolved murder.

19:06.321 --> 19:07.820
If you need us to investigate

19:07.923 --> 19:09.656
unexplained activity in your home,

19:09.758 --> 19:12.458
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.260
Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

19:14.362 --> 19:15.528
and we'll help if we can.

19:26.255 --> 19:28.755
During my research, I
came across several families

19:28.855 --> 19:30.455
who used to own my client's land.

19:30.557 --> 19:33.224
Now one family, the Barrys, stood out.

19:33.326 --> 19:35.593
Three of them died
right on the property.

19:35.695 --> 19:37.395
I'm on my way to meet with a genealogist

19:37.497 --> 19:39.731
who says this family
suffered from illness,

19:39.833 --> 19:41.933
depression, and madness.

19:46.973 --> 19:49.674
So, Julie, thanks for
helpin' me out with my case.

19:49.776 --> 19:52.277
The Barry family... what
can you tell me about them?

19:52.379 --> 19:55.013
Bernard and his wife, Mary, um,

19:55.115 --> 19:56.714
were both Irish immigrants

19:56.816 --> 19:59.083
who came over to the U.S. in the 1850s

19:59.185 --> 20:00.952
- during the potato famine.
- Okay.

20:01.054 --> 20:05.924
Bernard and his wife, Mary,
purchased the property in 1890.

20:06.026 --> 20:07.058
Who moved there with them?

20:07.160 --> 20:09.694
A daughter, Maryann, who was 30.

20:09.796 --> 20:12.266
And then their youngest
daughter, Francis, who was 15.

20:12.366 --> 20:14.466
Now I know there was deaths
associated with family

20:14.568 --> 20:15.801
on the property.

20:15.903 --> 20:17.102
What'd you find out?

20:17.204 --> 20:19.871
Well, the first one occurred in 1915,

20:19.973 --> 20:22.107
and that was Mary, the wife.

20:22.209 --> 20:25.177
Okay. Have her obituary here.

20:25.279 --> 20:30.515
She became ill and
suffered for nearly a year

20:30.617 --> 20:33.318
until she contracted pneumonia

20:33.420 --> 20:36.788
and lived with that
painfully for 5 days, uh,

20:36.890 --> 20:38.657
before she finally passed.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.625
I have a copy of her
death certificate here

20:40.727 --> 20:44.362
which lists pneumonia
as the 'cause of death.

20:44.465 --> 20:46.198
- Oh, she was 82?
- Yeah.

20:46.300 --> 20:50.569
And you know, my mother
suffered same age from emphysema

20:50.671 --> 20:52.337
and wound up dyin' from pneumonia.

20:52.439 --> 20:54.072
- And that's a miserable...
- Yes.

20:54.174 --> 20:55.273
...way of life.

20:58.812 --> 21:01.446
I'm seeing that angry older woman again.

21:01.548 --> 21:06.117
She kinda looks like
an older Irish lady.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.587
I hear, like, "Mabel."

21:08.689 --> 21:11.423
I think she was, like, 70 when she died.

21:11.525 --> 21:14.960
I think she's got, like,
cancer or something.

21:15.062 --> 21:16.394
This is what she dies from.

21:16.497 --> 21:18.763
And this is, like, a long time ago.

21:18.866 --> 21:22.467
I would say this is, like, '20s, '30s?

21:22.569 --> 21:23.869
And the guy's, like, big.

21:23.971 --> 21:26.037
Her husband's, like, a big guy.

21:26.139 --> 21:28.173
They didn't have a good marriage.

21:28.275 --> 21:29.608
And it was the woman,

21:29.710 --> 21:33.078
this little woman who would... you know,

21:33.180 --> 21:35.981
I think she beat the [bleep]
out of her husband all the time.

21:38.252 --> 21:39.918
Like, pretty bad.

21:40.020 --> 21:41.820
This is strange.

21:41.922 --> 21:44.556
Mary's death certificate
lists her son, Bernard Jr.,

21:44.658 --> 21:46.258
as the informant.

21:46.360 --> 21:50.028
Yes, we know that Bernard Sr., uh,

21:50.130 --> 21:52.664
was suffering from
dementia when he died.

21:52.766 --> 21:54.065
So it's quite possible

21:54.167 --> 21:57.202
that his son was the informant
on the death certificate

21:57.304 --> 21:58.937
because he might've started

21:59.039 --> 22:01.139
to show signs of dementia at this point.

22:01.241 --> 22:03.875
Okay, so now that Mary's dead,
who's taking care of Bernard?

22:03.977 --> 22:05.744
Their daughter, Maryann,

22:05.846 --> 22:08.480
she's the primary
caregiver for her father,

22:08.582 --> 22:11.449
who's probably continuing
on in his dementia.

22:11.552 --> 22:14.886
At some point, she
gets extremely depressed

22:14.988 --> 22:19.391
and she starves herself,
um, and dies as a result.

22:19.493 --> 22:21.126
- She starved herself to death?
- Yes.

22:21.228 --> 22:24.796
We have a copy of her
death certificate here.

22:24.898 --> 22:26.498
She was 56.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.467
And you'll notice that they
do list a contributing factor

22:29.570 --> 22:31.236
of melancholia.

22:31.338 --> 22:33.171
So what happens to the dad?

22:33.273 --> 22:37.242
By 1926, his suffering finally ends.

22:37.344 --> 22:39.044
- Okay, he...
- He passes away on the property.

22:39.146 --> 22:41.179
Okay, so what's the official
cause of death for him?

22:41.281 --> 22:45.884
Well, his death certificate
lists heart failure

22:45.986 --> 22:49.187
with a contributing factor of senility.

22:53.761 --> 22:55.494
Another thing caught my eye in research.

22:55.596 --> 22:57.896
It was a deadly factory
explosion down the block

22:57.998 --> 22:59.698
from Michael and Angie's house.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.933
I reached out to a
historian who said it was

23:02.036 --> 23:04.903
one of the biggest tragedies
in the town's history.

23:11.211 --> 23:13.879
So I gotta assume this
is where the factory was?

23:13.981 --> 23:15.247
That's right. This was, uh, the location

23:15.349 --> 23:19.217
of the Parlin Orendorff
manufacturing company.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.686
Okay. What did they manufacture?

23:20.788 --> 23:23.789
Well, mostly farm products
and especially the steel plow,

23:23.891 --> 23:26.291
which was so important to
the evolution of farming

23:26.393 --> 23:27.959
in the Midwest.

23:28.062 --> 23:30.429
This is a picture of
how the plant looked

23:30.531 --> 23:32.764
at its very best.

23:32.866 --> 23:34.966
Okay, so the day of the
explosion, what happened?

23:35.069 --> 23:37.502
It was December 18, 1882.

23:37.604 --> 23:39.171
7:00 in the morning, the first shift

23:39.273 --> 23:40.372
had just gone on the job.

23:40.474 --> 23:42.908
7:10, this tremendous explosion occurs.

23:43.010 --> 23:45.410
Debris is shot up into
the air all over town.

23:45.512 --> 23:47.479
It falls in peoples' yards.

23:47.581 --> 23:50.182
Many people thought there
had been an earthquake.

23:50.284 --> 23:52.451
Uh, buildings shook, windows rattled,

23:52.553 --> 23:53.752
people ran out of their houses

23:53.854 --> 23:55.854
to try to find out what was going on.

23:55.956 --> 23:59.224
What had happened was
that three of the boilers,

23:59.326 --> 24:00.926
which were used to generate steam

24:01.028 --> 24:04.763
which powered the equipment
in the plant, had exploded.

24:04.865 --> 24:07.766
The building came down on the
workers, fell down on them,

24:07.868 --> 24:09.167
and a fire was started.

24:09.269 --> 24:12.471
Some of the employees who
had escaped the explosion

24:12.573 --> 24:15.340
tried to go in and see if
they could save some people.

24:15.442 --> 24:16.541
Right.

24:16.643 --> 24:18.977
Well, they got in and
found six people dead

24:19.079 --> 24:20.846
- right at their workstation.
- Ah.

24:20.948 --> 24:23.515
And the interesting thing about
that was they died in a position

24:23.617 --> 24:25.384
which suggests they had no idea

24:25.486 --> 24:27.753
that an explosion was about to happen.

24:27.855 --> 24:30.555
They did find four people
who were still living

24:30.657 --> 24:31.823
and they carried them out.

24:31.925 --> 24:33.125
Three of those died.

24:33.227 --> 24:35.594
So the number of people
killed in the explosion

24:35.696 --> 24:37.729
- was nine people killed.
- Nine people killed.

24:37.831 --> 24:39.431
- Yeah.
- And six right at their stations?

24:39.533 --> 24:40.599
That's right. Six never moved.

24:40.701 --> 24:41.800
Yeah. Right.

24:41.902 --> 24:43.602
People must've been like,
"What the hell was that?"

24:43.704 --> 24:44.669
Oh, absolutely.

24:44.772 --> 24:46.037
People from all over town

24:46.140 --> 24:48.306
were... they were just so
startled by this, that it...

24:48.409 --> 24:50.542
they were running to the plant
to find out about what's...

24:50.644 --> 24:52.351
And it so dominated the...
the economy, the area.

24:52.377 --> 24:52.803
Right.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.046
Everybody was concerned about it, yeah.

25:00.487 --> 25:03.655
I feel, like, disoriented.

25:03.757 --> 25:08.126
I am seeing people coming this way

25:08.228 --> 25:12.130
towards the house from...

25:12.232 --> 25:15.233
the dirt driveway from this direction.

25:15.335 --> 25:16.468
Any idea when this was?

25:16.570 --> 25:18.603
Like, the '20s or '30s.

25:18.705 --> 25:21.273
I do here, like, a lot
of yelling and stuff.

25:24.689 --> 25:29.325
There's a lot of commotion,
uh, going on. Like, angry.

25:29.427 --> 25:32.461
Everybody's just
agitated and pissed off.

25:32.563 --> 25:34.663
It's all crazy.

25:41.005 --> 25:43.339
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

25:43.441 --> 25:47.743
but the 20-year-old bully
concerned me the most.

25:47.845 --> 25:49.512
He's white.

25:49.614 --> 25:52.181
His face shape was more squared.

25:52.283 --> 25:55.651
And he had a weird-kinda look.

25:55.753 --> 25:58.521
Next, I described how
he torments the living.

25:58.623 --> 26:00.489
He's in the closet

26:00.591 --> 26:03.592
and he's, like, scratching his
finger down the closet door.

26:03.694 --> 26:05.594
And it's just, like, a black hole.

26:05.696 --> 26:11.167
In the room, there's a
kid being freaked out.

26:13.538 --> 26:15.805
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:15.907 --> 26:17.606
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:38.166 --> 26:41.033
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:41.135 --> 26:42.835
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

26:42.937 --> 26:45.972
and our clients for the first time.

26:46.074 --> 26:48.407
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Mike and Angie.

26:48.509 --> 26:51.143
They're a great,
down-to-Earth couple, uh,

26:51.245 --> 26:53.879
who are going through a
hell of a time in this house.

26:53.982 --> 26:57.850
But this is the reason I took this case.

26:57.952 --> 26:59.752
This is their son, Layne.

26:59.854 --> 27:01.087
Now Layne is 7,

27:01.189 --> 27:04.190
and he's basically scared
to death in his own house.

27:04.292 --> 27:06.425
The activity here is
ruining his childhood.

27:06.527 --> 27:10.696
And they're worried now
that even their daughter,

27:10.798 --> 27:13.265
Hannelore, is startin'
to have these experiences.

27:13.368 --> 27:15.434
Mike and Angie don't know
how to protect their kids,

27:15.536 --> 27:17.336
and they're desperate for help.

27:17.438 --> 27:20.206
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about your family dynamics,

27:20.308 --> 27:21.541
I'll have her describe her walk for us.

27:23.266 --> 27:25.366
There's several conscious entities

27:25.468 --> 27:26.868
who are very active here.

27:26.970 --> 27:29.170
The first one was an elderly woman

27:29.272 --> 27:32.740
who has major anger control issues.

27:32.842 --> 27:35.610
And I encountered her upstairs.

27:35.712 --> 27:39.380
Her energy is really horrendous.

27:39.482 --> 27:44.318
The living would feel
her stress and her fear

27:44.420 --> 27:47.421
and this oppressive anxiety.

27:47.524 --> 27:49.023
And she's always watching.

27:49.125 --> 27:52.159
Uh, that's her big thing. You
know, Amy, you might've noticed

27:52.262 --> 27:54.028
the upstairs is under construction.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.564
Mike's been tryin' to turn
it into a master bedroom.

27:56.666 --> 27:58.733
Why don't you explain to
Amy why it's not finished?

27:58.835 --> 28:01.636
That is almost a
5- year-long project.

28:01.738 --> 28:04.939
When I'm up there, I
have so much bad feelings,

28:05.041 --> 28:06.974
I just can't get any work done up there.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.042
It's like somebody's just sittin' there,

28:08.144 --> 28:09.143
starin' right at me.

28:09.245 --> 28:11.279
It freaks the hell outta me.

28:11.381 --> 28:14.081
So this old, cranky woman...
any idea who she might've been?

28:14.183 --> 28:16.250
She lived here with her husband.

28:16.352 --> 28:18.786
They had a terrible marriage.

28:18.888 --> 28:21.455
And interestingly, she beat him.

28:21.558 --> 28:23.024
Oh, my.

28:23.126 --> 28:24.892
Yeah. And he was, like, a big guy,

28:24.994 --> 28:26.127
and she was really short.

28:26.229 --> 28:27.995
She was, like, 5 feet tall.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.597
I think she was from Ireland.

28:29.699 --> 28:31.032
I got the name Mabel.

28:31.134 --> 28:33.501
She was in her 70s when she died,

28:33.603 --> 28:36.203
and I think it was cancer.

28:36.306 --> 28:37.471
It's a long shot,

28:37.574 --> 28:39.273
but one of the original
owners on the property

28:39.375 --> 28:40.741
was an Irish woman.

28:40.843 --> 28:42.543
Her name wasn't Mabel, but it was Mary.

28:42.645 --> 28:44.378
Mary Barry was her name.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.882
She and her husband, Bernard,
moved onto the property in 1890.

28:47.984 --> 28:49.150
They were older when they moved here.

28:49.252 --> 28:50.484
They were both in their 50s.

28:50.587 --> 28:52.954
But the husband, Bernard,
started to lose his mind.

28:53.056 --> 28:54.855
He started havin' dementia.

28:54.958 --> 28:56.924
Mary may have had a hard
time takin' care of him.

28:57.026 --> 29:00.194
In 1915, Mary came down
with terrible illness.

29:00.296 --> 29:02.763
The official cause
of death is pneumonia.

29:04.734 --> 29:07.568
Now the woman you saw, you
said might've died in her 70s.

29:07.670 --> 29:10.471
Uh, Mary Barry was 82 when she died.

29:10.573 --> 29:11.772
Okay.

29:11.874 --> 29:14.375
Now she had a daughter
who died a horrible death

29:14.477 --> 29:17.111
on the property as
well, only 3 years later.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.213
Mm. Her name was Maryann.

29:19.315 --> 29:20.915
She was takin' care of her dad,

29:21.017 --> 29:23.751
and she got extremely depressed

29:23.853 --> 29:26.454
and she starved herself to death.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.456
Now Bernard stayed on the property

29:28.558 --> 29:31.292
and he sank deeper and
deeper into this illness.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.260
And he died about 10 years later.

29:33.363 --> 29:35.463
Now, could Mary be the woman you saw?

29:35.565 --> 29:37.231
'Cause you said she was
a housewife and Irish.

29:37.333 --> 29:38.833
- I believe so, yes.
- Okay.

29:38.935 --> 29:40.434
I do. Could she be the reason

29:40.536 --> 29:42.603
Mike's so uncomfortable
on the second floor?

29:42.705 --> 29:44.305
Yeah.

29:44.407 --> 29:47.241
The other thing is, you're
kinda the same, like,

29:47.343 --> 29:51.979
build and height as her husband.

29:52.081 --> 29:55.483
So I wonder if she's...

29:55.585 --> 29:56.984
Confusing me with him?

29:57.086 --> 29:58.386
Yeah.

30:02.525 --> 30:03.991
What else did you see on the walk?

30:04.767 --> 30:07.601
So then I came down here.

30:07.704 --> 30:08.736
I did not like it.

30:08.838 --> 30:10.738
I felt, like, very dizzy.

30:10.840 --> 30:14.542
And then I saw this
little man down here.

30:14.644 --> 30:17.445
He was chubby. He was in his 50s.

30:17.547 --> 30:22.583
And his favorite area is
over in the corner over there.

30:22.685 --> 30:24.418
He likes that.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.254
He can get very
aggressive with the living

30:27.357 --> 30:28.856
when they come down here.

30:28.958 --> 30:30.458
You'll actually kinda feel him, like,

30:30.560 --> 30:34.662
barreling towards you,
invading your space.

30:34.764 --> 30:38.866
And he also does shove and push.

30:38.968 --> 30:41.235
Tell her the story about
the old man you saw.

30:41.337 --> 30:43.704
I was down here putting
together the pool table,

30:43.806 --> 30:45.072
and I just happened to look up.

30:45.174 --> 30:47.174
All I could see was his
shoulders and his face

30:47.276 --> 30:48.576
in that window.

30:48.678 --> 30:51.512
And I sat here, petrified,
for about 5 minutes, just,

30:51.614 --> 30:53.114
"Am I seein' what I'm seein'?"

30:53.216 --> 30:54.548
And the reason that window's black

30:54.650 --> 30:56.016
is 'cause I painted it black.

30:56.119 --> 30:58.719
- Oh,.
- Yeah.

30:58.821 --> 31:02.556
I feel like he's, like,
right here, creeping on me.

31:02.658 --> 31:04.191
Tell her about
when you got bumped.

31:04.293 --> 31:06.293
I was down her doin'
laundry, I was folding it.

31:06.396 --> 31:09.397
Um, all of a sudden from the back,

31:09.499 --> 31:10.998
he, like, bumped into me.

31:11.100 --> 31:13.567
- Mm.
- Like, you can feel it.

31:13.669 --> 31:15.436
I'm thinkin' you're seein' her husband.

31:15.538 --> 31:17.638
- The husband with dementia?
- Yeah.

31:17.740 --> 31:19.407
I wonder if this guy's watchin' you now.

31:19.509 --> 31:20.608
Without a doubt.

31:20.710 --> 31:22.777
He's always there.

31:22.879 --> 31:24.545
We're not gonna provoke him.

31:28.584 --> 31:30.484
So what else did you see?

31:30.586 --> 31:32.286
Uh, went into the yellow room...

31:32.388 --> 31:33.320
Which is Layne's room.

31:33.423 --> 31:37.091
And, uh, I saw a
dead 20-year-old.

31:37.193 --> 31:38.459
He's a bully,

31:38.561 --> 31:42.229
and he likes to prey on
the weak and the vulnerable.

31:42.331 --> 31:46.500
The thing about him, he
can take different forms.

31:46.602 --> 31:50.404
So, like, I saw him
acting like a creepy elf.

31:50.506 --> 31:53.607
He has, like, the pointed
ears, sharp teeth, long nails.

31:53.709 --> 31:55.810
And his eyes can get really, you know,

31:55.912 --> 31:57.945
he'll make 'em dark and evil-looking.

31:58.047 --> 32:00.314
He can cause illness,

32:00.416 --> 32:06.587
but what he would prefer to
do is punch or kick or slap.

32:06.689 --> 32:11.125
He wants to be physical
with this person.

32:11.227 --> 32:12.860
Well, that's why we're here.

32:12.962 --> 32:15.029
Layne and I spoke for a long time,

32:15.131 --> 32:19.533
and he had too many
experiences to go through.

32:19.635 --> 32:22.069
When you mentioned
this elf-like creature,

32:22.171 --> 32:26.006
Angie, tell Amy how Layne
describes how he sees the devil.

32:26.108 --> 32:27.475
He hyperventilated.

32:27.577 --> 32:31.178
Like, he couldn't even
talk about what he'd seen.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.315
He'd explain it like he's
holding onto his toy chest

32:34.417 --> 32:36.484
and, like... like smiling, like,

32:36.586 --> 32:38.085
"Yeah, I'm gonna getcha."

32:38.187 --> 32:40.054
Like, to scare him.

32:40.156 --> 32:42.623
It breaks my heart to look at this,

32:42.725 --> 32:45.192
but this is what he says he sees.

32:45.294 --> 32:46.393
Wow.

32:46.496 --> 32:48.395
And he said to me, it's the devil.

32:48.498 --> 32:52.266
I had a sketch done of what
I saw goin' on in the room.

32:59.242 --> 33:01.242
Oh, this poor kid.

33:04.814 --> 33:06.313
Oh, my God.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.686
Sorry.

33:15.491 --> 33:16.724
Sorry.

33:19.829 --> 33:23.197
It's just not fair,
you know?

33:23.299 --> 33:26.100
That it scares him,
and I can't protect him.

33:29.906 --> 33:32.339
Now Layne told me that
he thinks he's open.

33:32.441 --> 33:33.440
- Yes.
- Yeah.

33:33.543 --> 33:34.942
Really?

33:35.044 --> 33:36.644
He talks like he's 40.

33:36.746 --> 33:39.380
And it scares kids away.

33:39.482 --> 33:43.083
I got a message from a
parent saying that they just

33:43.185 --> 33:45.419
don't want their child
to hang out with Layne.

33:47.423 --> 33:48.956
Him sounding
like a 40-year-old

33:49.058 --> 33:51.892
is pretty common with
sensitives 'cause basically,

33:51.994 --> 33:54.695
they've really been
surrounded by subject matter

33:54.797 --> 33:57.398
that is way beyond their years.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.600
The dead come and they show and tell you

33:59.702 --> 34:01.335
their entire life story...

34:01.437 --> 34:02.703
Whoa.

34:02.805 --> 34:04.672
...before they can move on.

34:04.774 --> 34:06.607
So we think Layne's a medium.

34:06.709 --> 34:08.742
Yeah.

34:13.416 --> 34:17.585
I then followed the dead
guy into the master bedroom.

34:17.687 --> 34:20.688
I saw him with a living woman

34:20.790 --> 34:24.858
and I saw the dead man being
sexually inappropriate with her,

34:24.960 --> 34:28.762
maybe putting sexual
thoughts into her mind.

34:28.864 --> 34:32.132
In the bathroom, uh, if I
take showers late at night,

34:32.234 --> 34:34.301
there's definitely a male in there,

34:34.402 --> 34:35.936
to the point where it was after midnight

34:36.038 --> 34:39.005
and I yelled, "Get out!"

34:39.108 --> 34:40.574
I also felt this guy

34:40.676 --> 34:44.277
would make this living woman
feel restless and anxious,

34:44.380 --> 34:46.347
and I saw her pacing around.

34:46.449 --> 34:48.649
And she's having weird,
intrusive thoughts,

34:48.751 --> 34:51.585
like she wants to run
away and leave this life.

34:51.687 --> 34:55.789
I do have, um, restless
nights, lots of restless nights.

34:55.891 --> 34:58.492
Okay.

34:58.594 --> 35:01.695
Do you have any idea who this
guy might have been in life?

35:01.797 --> 35:04.865
I know he had a very bad
life, very rough life.

35:04.967 --> 35:09.069
I got that he was from
the '30s and the '40s.

35:09.171 --> 35:12.970
Uh, a bully in life,
just like he is in death,

35:13.070 --> 35:15.670
and he either dropped out
of school or was kicked out.

35:15.772 --> 35:18.239
I wasn't sure I got
the whole story on that.

35:18.341 --> 35:21.042
Um, he was in and out of prisons.

35:21.144 --> 35:25.480
And I saw him with oil and
wrenches and in a garage,

35:25.582 --> 35:27.782
so I think he worked on cars as well.

35:27.884 --> 35:29.551
That was like,
his... his thing.

35:29.653 --> 35:32.687
Uh, and I'm not sure
when or how he died.

35:32.789 --> 35:34.689
You said the guy was
in and out of prison,

35:34.791 --> 35:36.791
high school dropout, worked on cars.

35:36.893 --> 35:40.428
So I do have one guy in my
research that fits that bill.

35:40.530 --> 35:43.665
In 1955, there was an
8- year-old girl named Janice May

35:43.767 --> 35:46.334
who was found beaten
and sexually assaulted

35:46.436 --> 35:48.136
4,000 feet from your property.

35:48.238 --> 35:51.372
I got a photo of her here.

35:51.475 --> 35:53.875
She was unconscious but
alive, taken to the hospital,

35:53.977 --> 35:56.010
and died an hour later.

35:56.113 --> 35:58.446
They ended up arresting
a 29-year-old male

35:58.548 --> 36:00.115
by the name of Lloyd Miller,

36:00.217 --> 36:02.951
who was a taxi driver in town.

36:03.053 --> 36:05.887
I got a picture of this guy right here.

36:05.989 --> 36:08.556
Oh,.

36:08.658 --> 36:11.493
Now, this guy sounds a lot like
the guy you met in Layne's room.

36:11.595 --> 36:14.129
He was a high school dropout,
he was in the Coast Guard

36:14.231 --> 36:17.031
and the Army, but went
AWOL three separate times.

36:17.134 --> 36:19.534
In his early 20s, he
stole a car in California

36:19.636 --> 36:22.370
and spent 7 months in a prison farm.

36:22.472 --> 36:25.607
His dream was to work as
an auto mechanic in Detroit,

36:25.709 --> 36:28.676
but he drifted from job to
job, mostly as a laborer.

36:28.778 --> 36:31.279
After the murder, they
found him 150 miles away

36:31.381 --> 36:33.014
on his way to Detroit,

36:33.116 --> 36:34.449
and they arrested him.

36:34.551 --> 36:37.519
After 2 days of interrogation,
he confessed to the murder.

36:37.621 --> 36:39.521
Now later on, he recanted

36:39.623 --> 36:42.123
and said he was coerced
into this confession,

36:42.225 --> 36:43.424
but he was convicted

36:43.527 --> 36:45.760
and sentenced to the electric chair.

36:45.862 --> 36:47.829
Now eventually, it was found

36:47.931 --> 36:50.598
that the prosecution
fudged some of the evidence.

36:50.700 --> 36:54.068
In 1967, the Supreme Court
overturned his conviction.

36:54.171 --> 36:55.670
He was a free man.

36:55.772 --> 36:58.873
He wind out moving to
Mexico, got married,

36:58.975 --> 37:00.308
and became a minister.

37:00.410 --> 37:02.810
- Are you freaking kidding me?
- No.

37:02.913 --> 37:04.312
He came back to the States

37:04.414 --> 37:06.714
and he died in Reading,
Pennsylvania, in 2013

37:06.816 --> 37:07.949
at the age of 86.

37:08.051 --> 37:09.751
Oh, my gosh.

37:11.555 --> 37:12.921
Wow.

37:13.023 --> 37:15.423
All right, now do you
think this guy could be Miller?

37:15.525 --> 37:17.892
I had a sketch done of him, so...

37:19.496 --> 37:20.862
All right.

37:21.765 --> 37:24.999
Well, he's 29 in this photo.

37:28.939 --> 37:30.238
Wow.

37:30.340 --> 37:31.806
Take a look at this.

37:31.908 --> 37:33.675
Oh.

37:35.845 --> 37:37.712
Whoa.

37:37.814 --> 37:41.683
Like... to me, it's identical.
Like, the nose, the lips...

37:41.785 --> 37:43.284
The... the
nose and the lips is...

37:43.386 --> 37:44.919
The eyebrows.

37:47.057 --> 37:48.356
So this son of a [bleep]

37:48.458 --> 37:50.758
Is the one acting like
a devil to a 7-year-old?

37:50.860 --> 37:52.594
Yes.

37:56.569 --> 37:58.002
This guy totally did this.

37:58.104 --> 37:59.537
I want to grab the son of a

37:59.639 --> 38:01.172
By his throat right now.

38:01.274 --> 38:03.441
I'm really pissed off.

38:03.543 --> 38:05.043
It's on.

38:19.454 --> 38:20.853
So this son of a

38:20.955 --> 38:23.422
Is the one acting like
a devil to a 7-year-old?

38:23.524 --> 38:25.291
Yes.

38:28.796 --> 38:31.063
This guy totally did this.

38:31.165 --> 38:32.498
I want to grab the son of a

38:32.600 --> 38:33.699
By his throat right now.

38:33.801 --> 38:35.101
I'm really pissed off.

38:35.203 --> 38:37.303
It's on.

38:40.075 --> 38:42.108
So why is this dirt bag here?

38:42.210 --> 38:45.011
When he died, he came right back

38:45.113 --> 38:48.247
to his favorite memory
and his happiest moment,

38:48.349 --> 38:50.750
which would be killing that child.

38:50.852 --> 38:52.218
And then you guys moved in.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.121
And he's drawn to Layne
because of his abilities.

38:55.223 --> 38:57.557
And then the sexual thing
is coming out, unfortunately,

38:57.659 --> 38:59.158
in... in your direction.

39:05.567 --> 39:07.133
So, Mike and Angie, when we spoke,

39:07.235 --> 39:10.203
you guys told me family comes first

39:10.305 --> 39:12.305
and you'd do anything
to protect your kids.

39:12.407 --> 39:14.640
Now I'm gonna find out
exactly what that's gonna take,

39:14.743 --> 39:16.542
and for that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:22.417 --> 39:28.821
The main person I want involved
is to be a male who's a medium.

39:28.923 --> 39:34.160
And I want this male to
be a pretty tough cookie.

39:34.262 --> 39:38.598
I want him to then deal
with the elderly female.

39:38.700 --> 39:41.100
This is going to be a process,

39:41.202 --> 39:44.170
and it's probably not gonna
be a pleasant one for him

39:44.272 --> 39:47.240
because he does need to
be aggressive with her.

39:47.342 --> 39:49.675
Once she goes, her husband'll go.

39:49.778 --> 39:53.112
Then I want him to come
back with a demonologist

39:53.214 --> 39:55.414
to get rid of him.

39:55.517 --> 39:57.250
And I don't think he has
any intentions of moving on

39:57.352 --> 40:01.053
because he is perfectly
happy where he is.

40:01.156 --> 40:04.090
That's when the demonologist
is going to take over,

40:04.192 --> 40:08.628
and that person will perform
an exorcism of the location.

40:08.730 --> 40:12.498
And they will remove him
and send him on his way.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.968
So once all that's taken care
of, I want you to buy a lock

40:16.070 --> 40:18.137
and put it on Layne's closet door.

40:18.239 --> 40:20.940
Putting it on will give
him a sense of empowerment,

40:21.042 --> 40:23.042
where he's taking
control of the situation

40:23.144 --> 40:27.480
and he's locking them in
there and away from him

40:27.582 --> 40:29.782
so they can't invade his space.

40:29.884 --> 40:32.051
The other thing is,
is I'll be sending you

40:32.153 --> 40:34.687
some guided meditations.

40:34.789 --> 40:38.057
And these guided
mediations are very simple

40:38.159 --> 40:42.428
and they are for balancing,
grounding, and protection.

40:42.530 --> 40:45.598
They're so basic, but
they're so important.

40:45.700 --> 40:48.467
He needs to integrate
these into... into his life.

40:48.570 --> 40:50.102
Will he ever have a normal childhood,

40:50.205 --> 40:51.571
or is this gonna be something
he's gonna have to deal with?

40:51.673 --> 40:54.874
Well, yeah, he's gonna
have to deal with it, like,

40:54.976 --> 40:57.210
his whole life.

40:57.312 --> 40:58.945
Now Hannelore,

40:59.047 --> 41:01.214
you consider her somebody
that's gonna have abilities,

41:01.316 --> 41:03.182
or is she just open because of her age?

41:03.284 --> 41:06.252
Right now, it's just because of her age.

41:06.354 --> 41:10.156
When might they find out when
If she's gonna be like Layne?

41:10.832 --> 41:12.865
Between 5 and 8.

41:12.967 --> 41:15.435
At least we'll know how
to handle it, you know,

41:15.537 --> 41:17.837
with her, doing it with him.

41:17.939 --> 41:20.973
Sounds like a little bit
of work, but I'm on it.

41:21.075 --> 41:23.910
And this solution is
gonna help them both.

41:24.012 --> 41:24.977
Are you gonna take Amy's advice?

41:25.079 --> 41:26.546
- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

41:26.648 --> 41:28.214
- No doubts.
- Okay.

41:28.316 --> 41:29.515
Mm-hmm.

41:30.418 --> 41:32.218
I really hope Mike and Angie

41:32.320 --> 41:34.821
follow my advice and contact
a male medium and demonologist

41:34.923 --> 41:37.256
to remove the dead
terrorizing their family.

41:37.358 --> 41:38.324
Once they're gone,

41:38.426 --> 41:40.526
Layne can learn to manage his abilities,

41:40.628 --> 41:42.528
and this family will find the peace

41:42.630 --> 41:44.096
they've been searching for.
