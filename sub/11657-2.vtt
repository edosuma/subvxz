01:00.166 --> 01:02.867
Oh, great. Great. Wonderful.
My daughter is lost.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.300
Oh, I'm just terrible
at giving directions.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.934
Dorothy, I gave Kate
the directions over the phone.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
And who are you... Rand McNally?

01:11.266 --> 01:12.867
You couldn't make a mistake?

01:14.633 --> 01:16.567
Shall I set this down someplace?

01:16.633 --> 01:20.433
No, Rose, go to the corner
and open a stand.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.867
-Dorothy...
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:23.934 --> 01:25.166
It's just that I'm so anxious

01:25.233 --> 01:27.500
about meeting this guy
that Kate's bringing.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.133
Do you think it's serious?

01:29.200 --> 01:31.867
Well, they've been together now
for six months.

01:31.934 --> 01:33.333
It's the longest she's been
interested

01:33.400 --> 01:35.100
in any man since Paul McCartney.

01:36.433 --> 01:38.467
Kate dated Paul McCartney?

01:40.467 --> 01:41.567
Yes, Rose.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.233
They wanted to get engaged,

01:43.300 --> 01:45.667
but I insisted that she finish grade
school.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.834
Dorothy, do you know anything
about this boy's family background?

01:49.900 --> 01:51.767
All I know is that he's a doctor.

01:51.834 --> 01:54.967
A doctor? Well, then,
the heck with his background.

01:55.266 --> 01:57.667
Do you have any idea how much
a doctor makes these days?

01:57.734 --> 02:00.100
No, I really don't care
what he does for a living.

02:00.166 --> 02:01.166
I mean, the important thing

02:01.233 --> 02:04.100
is that he and Kate
have a good relationship.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.000
(doorbell rings)

02:06.066 --> 02:07.367
'Course, if they happen
to get married,

02:07.433 --> 02:11.967
I will shout from every rooftop in
Miami, "my son-in-law's a doctor!"

02:13.133 --> 02:15.900
-Hi, mom!
-Oh, baby!

02:15.967 --> 02:19.300
Oh, it is so good to see you.

02:19.633 --> 02:21.467
Oh, look, everybody.
Look who's here.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.000
(Blanche) You look glorious.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.867
Honey, where is he?
Where's your doctor?

02:25.934 --> 02:28.467
Dennis is at a seminar.
I'll bring him by tomorrow.

02:28.533 --> 02:30.567
I can't find my culottes.

02:31.133 --> 02:33.600
Grandma, you look sensational.

02:33.667 --> 02:36.567
-Ohh!
-Squeeze you.

02:36.633 --> 02:38.166
Relax. Relax!

02:38.433 --> 02:39.934
You're already in the will.

02:42.533 --> 02:45.533
Before anyone does anything,
I have a big announcement to make.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.600
As my mother has undoubtedly already
told you and the rest of Miami,

02:50.667 --> 02:53.967
for the past six months, I've been
seeing a doctor named Dennis.

02:54.033 --> 02:55.066
That's your big announcement?

02:55.133 --> 02:57.233
You call your doctor
by his first name?

02:58.300 --> 03:00.400
Ma, ma, he's her boyfriend.

03:00.467 --> 03:02.600
He just happens to be a doctor, ok?

03:02.667 --> 03:04.200
Fine. What's the point?

03:04.633 --> 03:07.166
The day after tomorrow, Dennis
and I are flying to The Bahamas,

03:07.233 --> 03:08.233
and we're getting married.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.734
-(Rose) Oh, that's terrific!
-You what?

03:10.800 --> 03:14.800
Oh! Oh! Oh, I can't...
I can't believe it.

03:14.867 --> 03:16.900
Oh, I am so happy.

03:16.967 --> 03:19.900
My daughter is marrying a doctor...

03:21.533 --> 03:23.500
in The Bahamas.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.967
You are getting married in The Bahamas?

03:28.033 --> 03:29.233
This is fabulous.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.400
I always wanted to go to The Bahamas.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.567
Now, where the hell are my culottes?

03:34.767 --> 03:37.000
Oh, Kate, Kate, honey,

03:37.066 --> 03:40.533
I have always dreamed
of giving you a wedding,

03:40.600 --> 03:43.767
-ever since I had your overbite fixed.
-Mom, don't you think

03:43.834 --> 03:46.033
it would be a little awkward
with you and dad not talking?

03:46.100 --> 03:48.800
Oh, now, just a minute.
I'm not the one who ran off to Maui

03:48.867 --> 03:52.200
with someone half my age
and twice my bra size.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.533
You see what I mean?

03:54.600 --> 03:56.967
That's why we're getting married
in The Bahamas.

03:57.033 --> 03:59.033
You are not getting married
on an island

03:59.100 --> 04:02.667
by a priest wearing clam diggers
and a Harry Belafonte shirt.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.400
You're gonna get married
right here in Miami.

04:05.467 --> 04:09.000
Kate, I could put together a lovely
reception here at the house.

04:09.066 --> 04:10.667
And I could take care
of the catering.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.934
Well, I have always dreamed
of wearing a long white gown

04:14.000 --> 04:16.700
and marching down the aisle
on my father's arm.

04:18.667 --> 04:21.400
Who said anything
about inviting your father?

04:21.900 --> 04:25.233
It wouldn't be much of a wedding
without both of my parents there.

04:25.667 --> 04:28.066
Even if we got live doves?

04:31.333 --> 04:33.166
-Mother...
-Oh, all right, honey.

04:33.233 --> 04:36.033
Your wedding day should be
the most beautiful day of your life,

04:36.100 --> 04:40.033
and if you want to invite your father,
well, I'm willing to keep the peace.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.767
-Promise?
-Promise.

04:42.233 --> 04:43.233
Then it's settled.

04:43.300 --> 04:46.233
Now call your father
and tell the dirt bag he can come.

04:47.734 --> 04:49.266
(sighs) Forget it, mom.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.400
I can just as easily limbo down the aisle.

04:51.467 --> 04:52.967
Relax, honey, relax.

04:53.033 --> 04:55.633
I just want to get it all out of my
system before he gets here.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.700
-Now, go ahead. Call him.
-I'll call him. You talk to him.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.400
Oh, well, all right.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.467
If I can get through
an entire wedding with him,

05:02.533 --> 05:05.734
I should be able to handle
a simple phone conversation...

05:06.166 --> 05:08.700
with that yellow-bellied sleaze ball!

05:09.033 --> 05:12.734
Hello. Stan? Dorothy.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.900
Dorothy Zbornak.

05:14.967 --> 05:17.834
The one who gave you
the best years of her thighs?

05:21.166 --> 05:23.133
Yes, I'm fine. Fine.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.533
Yeah, it has been a long time.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.533
Yeah, well, you know,
after two years,

05:27.600 --> 05:30.000
I figured you weren't coming back.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.867
No, I'll tell you,
the reason I'm calling you...

05:32.934 --> 05:34.400
Kate is getting married.

05:35.033 --> 05:38.700
Yes, married.
Yes, yes, in a few days,

05:38.767 --> 05:40.800
and I'm giving her
a little wedding here in Miami,

05:40.867 --> 05:42.533
and I... I wanted to invite you.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.600
Can you come? You can? Grea...

05:46.200 --> 05:48.734
Oh, Chrissy can't.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.734
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:54.467 --> 05:55.734
Oh, really?

05:55.800 --> 06:00.100
No, I didn't know that could happen
from a tanning machine.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.400
Oh, she'll be thrilled to see you, too.

06:05.467 --> 06:08.033
She's standing right here. Hold on.

06:08.867 --> 06:10.734
Dorothy, you were magnificent.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.467
Oh, you certainly were.
How did you do it?

06:12.533 --> 06:15.233
Oh, I just kept telling myself
that once he was here,

06:15.300 --> 06:18.000
he'd be close enough to kill.

06:18.066 --> 06:20.300
(laughing)

06:30.133 --> 06:32.133
I can't believe
that Stan has the nerve

06:32.200 --> 06:33.934
to show his face at this wedding.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.300
The man has a right
to see his daughter get married.

06:36.367 --> 06:39.166
-I never should have called him.
-You never should have married him.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.333
-Hi, hi, hi!
-Oh, hi, Blanche.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.834
Oh, are my little wedding elves
still busy packing their tiny bundles?

06:46.900 --> 06:49.300
Wedding elves?

06:50.867 --> 06:54.033
It's that cheap hair dye she uses.
It finally ate through.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.700
No, we're... we're doing fine, Blanche.

06:57.767 --> 07:00.700
Oh, no, honey.
Sophia, you're using too much rice.

07:00.767 --> 07:02.867
Fine. This elf quits.

07:04.767 --> 07:07.934
I never understood why people throw
rice at weddings anyway.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.333
Because tomatoes leave stains.

07:12.934 --> 07:16.900
Um, could I talk to you two ladies
in the living room, please?

07:23.867 --> 07:25.867
I have some very distressing news.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.900
Sophia's been pilfering cheese balls.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.400
What?

07:34.467 --> 07:37.333
This morning I made 48 cheese balls.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.867
There are now 26.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.033
24.

07:42.867 --> 07:44.867
(doorbell rings)

07:45.600 --> 07:47.166
(chuckles)

07:49.800 --> 07:51.834
Hi, mom. Mom, this...

07:51.900 --> 07:53.633
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.967
It's Dennis.
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

07:57.300 --> 08:01.433
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Oh, flowers. Oh, my.

08:01.500 --> 08:05.934
You know, your father used to bring
me tulips every time we had a fight.

08:06.467 --> 08:09.967
Toward the end, our place looked like
Easter in Rotterdam.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.800
It's good to see that you're not bitter.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.800
Everybody, I'd like you to meet
my future son-in-law.

08:17.867 --> 08:20.066
This is Dennis, the gorgeous doctor.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.767
Dennis, I'd like you
to meet my best friends.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.433
-This is Rose.
-Hello, Rose.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.967
-And that's Blanche.
-How do you do?

08:26.033 --> 08:28.734
And that's Sophia.
That's Kate's grandma.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.867
You got your stethoscope?
I wouldn't mind a freebie.

08:35.667 --> 08:38.200
Grandma, Dennis doesn't have
a stethoscope.

08:38.266 --> 08:40.400
Of course not. He's on vacation.

08:40.467 --> 08:43.433
That's not what I mean.
Dennis is a podiatrist.

08:44.233 --> 08:45.367
Oh.

08:46.233 --> 08:48.100
Oh, a foot doctor.

08:48.433 --> 08:50.467
Why don't we all sit down, hmm?

08:51.500 --> 08:53.367
-Not there. Not there.
-Oh!

08:54.166 --> 08:56.667
Well, a podiatrist.

08:56.734 --> 08:59.934
Well, that's a very fascinating
profession.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.166
Tell me, Dennis, approximately how many
feet do you see in a week?

09:05.066 --> 09:07.633
Well, between my partners and me,
we see quite a few.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.800
Oh, it's a partnership.

09:10.233 --> 09:12.200
Have you ever met Dr. Scholl?

09:14.967 --> 09:17.767
Let's get to the point. Dennis,
what do you take home a week?

09:17.834 --> 09:19.367
Ma!

09:20.900 --> 09:25.567
It's all right. I understand.
Sophia, I am crazy about Kate,

09:25.633 --> 09:28.133
and I promise you she will never
want for anything.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.367
Ohh.

09:30.767 --> 09:33.633
I told you he was special.
Do you think dad will like him?

09:33.700 --> 09:37.867
Of course.
As long as he stays young and firm.

09:43.066 --> 09:45.367
Oh, Dennis,
it's going to be a pleasure

09:45.433 --> 09:47.567
welcoming you into our little family.

09:47.633 --> 09:52.567
And I just hope that you and Kate
have all the happiness in the world.

09:52.633 --> 09:56.467
Me too, and maybe one of your
children will be a real doctor.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.000
(doorbell rings)

10:06.633 --> 10:08.033
Hi. It was rea--

10:10.000 --> 10:11.533
(doorbell ringing)

10:16.033 --> 10:18.667
Dorothy, it's Stan.
Didn't you recognize me?

10:18.734 --> 10:22.467
Of course, I recognized you. That's
why I slammed the door in your face.

10:23.767 --> 10:25.533
Still the jokester, huh, Dorothy?

10:25.600 --> 10:30.166
And, uh, speaking of jokes, Stan,
that is some toupee you've got.

10:31.867 --> 10:33.400
-Oh.
-Oh, Rose,

10:33.467 --> 10:35.000
I'd like you to meet my ex-husband,

10:35.066 --> 10:36.667
-Stan Zbornak.
-Hello.

10:36.734 --> 10:38.300
And this is his hair.

10:41.967 --> 10:43.934
It's a pleasure to meet you both.

10:45.433 --> 10:47.800
Hello. Who invited Donny Osmond?

10:49.200 --> 10:52.266
-Ma, this is Stan.
-Hello, Sophia.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.633
It's the hair.
It makes me look different.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.500
Makes you look stupid.

10:57.033 --> 10:58.500
Oh, hello there.

10:58.567 --> 11:01.100
(Dorothy) Stan, I'd like you
to meet my friend Blanche.

11:01.166 --> 11:02.100
Charmed.

11:02.533 --> 11:04.000
-Daddy.
-Ohh.

11:04.066 --> 11:05.200
Ohh.

11:05.266 --> 11:07.600
Hello, princess.

11:09.734 --> 11:12.333
Oh, you look absolutely beautiful.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.800
I'm so glad you're here.
Thank you for coming.

11:14.867 --> 11:17.633
Oh, no, don't thank me.
Thank your mother.

11:18.467 --> 11:19.600
There aren't too many women around

11:19.667 --> 11:22.700
who could swallow their pride after
what went down between us.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.734
You're awesome, babe.
Absolutely awesome.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.667
-(growling)
-Shh. Dorothy.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.033
We better get to the church.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.567
-Don't you think so?
-Yeah.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.500
Grandma, why don't you come
with me and daddy?

11:35.567 --> 11:37.100
Come on, Sophia, it'll be fun.

11:37.367 --> 11:41.233
-We can catch up with old times.
-No, we can't. I had a stroke.

11:41.533 --> 11:44.000
Luckily, my memories of you
were wiped out.

11:46.367 --> 11:47.367
See ya.

11:47.433 --> 11:49.033
-Bye.
-(growls)

11:49.734 --> 11:51.266
Dorothy, are you all right?

11:51.333 --> 11:54.266
Oh, she's a trouper. She'll be fine,
won't you, Dorothy?

11:54.333 --> 11:58.000
-Not until I taste his blood.
-Now, you don't mean that.

11:58.066 --> 12:00.934
Listen, I want you to take a deep breath
and think pleasant thoughts.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.166
Come on, now, 1, 2, 3.

12:03.233 --> 12:05.066
(all inhale)

12:05.133 --> 12:07.300
-I'm not going.
-Dorothy!

12:07.367 --> 12:09.133
Your daughter's getting married.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.200
I cannot be in the same room with him.

12:11.266 --> 12:13.967
I know I'll do something crazy
and just ruin the whole wedding.

12:14.033 --> 12:15.900
Blanche and I will be right beside you.

12:15.967 --> 12:17.667
-Nothing can happen.
-I cannot do it.

12:17.734 --> 12:19.333
All right, I've heard enough.

12:19.633 --> 12:22.734
We are talking about your daughter's
wedding, Dorothy Zbornak.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.633
Now, you get on your feet,
get out that door. March!

12:28.033 --> 12:29.133
Oh, all right.

12:29.934 --> 12:32.400
All right. I'm going.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.834
But if anything awful happens,
it's on your heads.

12:41.533 --> 12:43.767
Oh, she's really upset.

12:43.834 --> 12:45.667
We better keep an eye on her.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.233
Oh, you're right.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.867
We better stick to her like a tight
shirt on a sweaty farm hand.

12:54.133 --> 12:57.800
You know, the type with the big
biceps and the hairy chest

12:57.867 --> 13:00.500
just glistening in the hot sun?

13:02.233 --> 13:04.100
I'm sorry, what were we
talking about?

13:06.967 --> 13:08.100
Dorothy.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.967
Oh, Dorothy. Oh, that's right.

13:10.033 --> 13:12.533
Yeah, honey,
you keep an eye on her.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.500
And I'm not saying this
because she is my daughter

13:29.567 --> 13:31.834
but she was
the best Abraham Lincoln

13:31.900 --> 13:34.066
-the third grade ever saw.
-(laughs)

13:34.133 --> 13:38.000
No, when she freed the second grade,
there was not a dry eye in the house.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.834
Somehow, I just can't picture Kate
as Abraham Lincoln.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.100
Stan, do me a favor.

13:42.166 --> 13:44.567
Take off your hair and hold it up to
Kate's chin.

13:47.533 --> 13:49.767
-Mother, you promised.
-I know, I know.

13:49.834 --> 13:51.500
Just ignore me, Stan.

13:51.567 --> 13:54.033
It should be easy.
You've had plenty of practice.

13:55.233 --> 13:57.900
Oh, princess, before I forget,
I want to invite you and Dennis

13:57.967 --> 14:00.767
to come spend some time with Chrissy
and me in our new house in Maui.

14:01.233 --> 14:03.767
-That sounds great.
-Yeah, it's primo.

14:04.367 --> 14:05.900
Oh, listen, I have some pictures.

14:07.100 --> 14:10.100
Take a look at that stretch of beach, huh?
That's our house.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.266
That is Chrissy on a new Hobie Cat.

14:12.767 --> 14:13.934
That's Chrissy in the hot tub.

14:14.367 --> 14:15.734
That's me and Chrissy at a luau.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.200
Is she the one with the apple
in her mouth?

14:21.333 --> 14:22.667
Ma...

14:22.734 --> 14:26.233
You know, she looks pretty good for
being in the ground for two hours.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.800
Rose. Rose, what are you doing?

14:30.200 --> 14:31.633
Watching the cheese balls.

14:31.934 --> 14:33.500
You're supposed to be watching Dorothy.

14:33.567 --> 14:35.800
I was watching Dorothy,

14:35.867 --> 14:38.567
but every time I watch her,
Sophia eats a cheese ball.

14:38.633 --> 14:41.467
Honey, let her have the darn cheese
balls. Nobody else wants 'em.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.533
Cheese ball, father?

14:45.600 --> 14:47.266
Oh, yes, thank you very much.

14:51.033 --> 14:53.166
Now I know what I'm giving up for lent.

14:56.700 --> 14:57.867
(no audio)

14:58.400 --> 15:01.400
Stanley, would you be a dear
and get me some champagne?

15:01.467 --> 15:04.066
It is always a pleasure to get a drink
for an attractive woman.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.467
I'll get one for you, too, Dorothy.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.400
Would you excuse us?

15:11.066 --> 15:14.400
Have you ever met a man who knows
how to push all your buttons?

15:14.800 --> 15:15.934
Just once.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.400
He was a Cabana boy in Pensacola.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.433
I am never going to get through this.
I just hate him too much.

15:23.500 --> 15:26.400
-I know I'm gonna do something crazy.
-Just simmer down here.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.333
Sit down here. I want to talk to you.
Dorothy... listen.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.133
I know this isn't easy for you, so...

15:31.667 --> 15:34.567
I'm gonna let you in on a sorority secret
that was passed on to me

15:34.633 --> 15:36.467
at miss MacGyver's finishing school.

15:36.834 --> 15:39.400
Now, whenever you feel
you're about to lose control,

15:39.467 --> 15:42.467
just take my hand
and give it a little squeeze.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.967
I guarantee you'll feel 100% better.

15:45.533 --> 15:47.066
And that's the big secret?

15:47.800 --> 15:51.467
Oh, no. The big secret was that
Miss MacGyver and Miss McKee

15:51.533 --> 15:54.300
were sharing a one-bedroom apartment
off-campus.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.600
-Oh, will you...
-What?

15:59.734 --> 16:00.934
Here you go, ladies.

16:01.633 --> 16:03.266
Dorothy, would you like some
hors d'oeuvres?

16:03.333 --> 16:04.500
No, thank you, Stan.

16:04.567 --> 16:05.867
Blanche, would you care for something?

16:05.934 --> 16:08.233
Doesn't look like you're fighting
the battle of the bulge.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.700
Ooh. Ow.
No, thank you, Stan.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.767
Well, then, I'd like to make a toast.

16:14.834 --> 16:16.433
Your attention, please, everybody.

16:17.934 --> 16:19.934
To my son-in-law and my daughter.

16:20.467 --> 16:23.800
May she be as happy with her new
life mate as I am with mine.

16:23.867 --> 16:25.767
(priest) Hear, hear.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.967
Blanche, don't you think it's time
we cut the cake?

16:38.033 --> 16:39.967
Oh, yes, I do, Rose.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.333
Who invited the priest?

16:44.400 --> 16:46.600
You know I can't cut loose
with a priest around.

16:46.667 --> 16:49.667
Sophia, he happens to be
a very nice man.

16:49.734 --> 16:51.400
He gives me the creeps.

16:52.033 --> 16:55.367
He's been following me.
They always follow the old people.

16:57.767 --> 17:01.300
It's like parking tickets.
They got a last rites quota.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.500
Sophia, there you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.033
Buzz off, padre.

17:11.100 --> 17:13.233
Rose, where's Dorothy?

17:13.600 --> 17:14.600
Well, I don't... she was here

17:14.667 --> 17:16.033
-a minute ago.
-Uh-oh.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.600
Oh, my God!

17:22.266 --> 17:24.800
-Give me that knife.
-What are you doing?

17:24.867 --> 17:26.867
I can't let you go through with this.

17:27.266 --> 17:29.133
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life

17:29.200 --> 17:31.734
rotting away
in some disgusting jail cell

17:31.800 --> 17:34.867
bribing screws for cigarettes
and toilet paper?

17:36.467 --> 17:39.967
Rose, in Miami it is not a felony
to cut the wedding cake.

17:40.033 --> 17:42.567
Cut the... wed...

17:44.934 --> 17:47.467
Oh, I thought
you were gonna stab Stan.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.967
Don't be ridiculous.

17:49.033 --> 17:51.367
Do you honestly believe
that I would stab Stan

17:51.433 --> 17:52.700
at my own daughter's wedding?

17:52.767 --> 17:55.767
-Oh, no, I guess not.
-Well, of course not.

17:55.834 --> 17:58.967
I would wait until after the wedding.
There are too many witnesses.

18:00.033 --> 18:03.066
-No! No...
-Kidding.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.633
Oh, don't do that to me.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.200
What are you doing?

18:14.266 --> 18:16.400
I just want to be by myself for a while.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.133
It's time to throw rice at the kids.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.200
I don't think I can go back out there.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.500
You're acting like a jerk.

18:24.567 --> 18:28.333
Thanks, ma. Thanks.
That really makes me feel a lot better.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.300
Don't get smart with your mother.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.467
Listen, Dorothy, I love you dearly,

18:33.533 --> 18:36.133
but you're not the first woman
to be dumped by her husband.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.934
Oh, ma, ma, it's not what he did.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.133
I mean, I've learned to live with that.
It's the way he did it.

18:42.734 --> 18:45.033
The least he could have done
was tell me to my face.

18:45.100 --> 18:48.200
If you're so angry with him, tell him.
You don't have to kill him.

18:48.266 --> 18:50.266
I know, but I want to.

18:51.633 --> 18:55.467
Dorothy, anger is a lot like a piece
of shredded wheat

18:55.533 --> 18:57.266
caught under your dentures.

18:58.867 --> 19:03.500
If you leave it there, you get a blister,
and you gotta eat Jell-o all week.

19:05.500 --> 19:09.100
If you get rid of it, the sore heals
and you feel better.

19:10.300 --> 19:14.600
Anger is like
a piece of shredded wheat?

19:15.934 --> 19:18.600
You want poetry,
you listen to Neil Diamond.

19:18.667 --> 19:21.333
You want good advice,
you listen to your mother.

19:22.667 --> 19:23.834
Maybe you're right.

19:24.300 --> 19:25.533
Of course I'm right.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.266
You think I got this old by being stupid?

19:30.066 --> 19:31.133
You know...

19:31.200 --> 19:33.800
you're the greatest mother in the world.

19:35.066 --> 19:36.900
Tell me something I don't know.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.300
-Oh, yeah, we do.
-Dad, don't forget...

19:42.367 --> 19:44.700
(talking over each other)

19:46.967 --> 19:49.000
sweetheart, you have a good time.

19:50.967 --> 19:53.400
Well, mother, I guess this is it.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.767
Goodbye, sweetheart.

19:56.667 --> 19:59.066
Now, listen, you be a good wife,
you hear?

19:59.834 --> 20:03.333
Be his friend, be his lover,
don't be his slave...

20:03.400 --> 20:05.934
Mom, mom, mom,
we'll talk when I get back.

20:06.467 --> 20:07.900
Thank you for everything.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.767
-I love you.
-Oh, I love you, too.

20:11.033 --> 20:12.967
And I love you, too, Dennis.

20:14.734 --> 20:17.033
-Goodbye, Dorothy.
-Oh, Dennis.

20:17.100 --> 20:19.567
Listen, don't take any guff from her.
Yeah.

20:20.333 --> 20:21.934
But take good care of her.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.367
'Cause if you don't, I'll kill you.
You know that.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.233
(Dorothy) Ok, everybody, out.
Goodbye! Out!

20:27.300 --> 20:28.800
Get out of here.

20:28.867 --> 20:30.667
-Bye!
-Bye-bye!

20:32.100 --> 20:34.266
Goodbye!

20:34.333 --> 20:36.734
Be happy! Be happy!

20:36.800 --> 20:37.900
I really...

20:44.533 --> 20:47.300
Dorothy, it was great.
Thanks for the hospitality.

20:48.166 --> 20:50.100
Sophia, girls, take care.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.967
Oh, Stan, just a minute.
I'd like to talk to you.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.400
Oh, sure, ok.

20:55.467 --> 20:57.300
Let's go where we can have
some privacy.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.100
Have a seat.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.700
Well... what can I do for you?

21:15.767 --> 21:19.000
The first thing you can do is get
rid of that ridiculous toupee.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.533
I want to speak
to the bald guy who left me.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.834
Ow!

21:24.400 --> 21:25.667
What's the matter with you?

21:26.400 --> 21:29.200
You walked out on me,
Stanley Zbornak.

21:29.266 --> 21:30.333
Now I know why.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.300
You walked out on me,

21:32.367 --> 21:34.900
and you didn't even have the decency
to tell me you were leaving.

21:35.333 --> 21:38.367
I heard it from some lawyer
over the telephone.

21:39.533 --> 21:44.900
A stranger, Stanley, a total stranger,
told me that my marriage was over.

21:44.967 --> 21:48.433
-Dorothy, look, things happened.
-Things happened.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.934
You're damn right things happened.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.667
38 years happened.

21:54.133 --> 22:01.133
38 years of sharing and crying
and dreaming and fighting and loving

22:01.200 --> 22:03.000
and... and children

22:03.066 --> 22:06.567
and diapers and... and school plays

22:06.633 --> 22:08.000
and little league

22:08.066 --> 22:11.266
and worrying if you'd get through
your gall-bladder surgery

22:11.333 --> 22:15.300
and wondering if I'd get through another
Sunday dinner at your mother's house.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.567
And the lean years,
when the business failed.

22:21.367 --> 22:22.867
And the good years.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.934
And the happy Christmases.

22:27.467 --> 22:30.300
All those things happened, Stanley,
and because they happened,

22:30.367 --> 22:33.533
I deserved better
than a stinking phone call

22:33.600 --> 22:35.834
from my husband's legal representative.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.867
You had a choice, Stanley,
and you took the easy way out,

22:39.934 --> 22:41.700
and it was a rotten thing to do.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.567
But now you're here in front of me,
and you can't run away,

22:47.633 --> 22:52.700
and I finally get to have
what you tried to cheat me out of.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.400
I finally get to say goodbye, Stanley.

22:57.600 --> 23:01.033
-Look, Dorothy, we...
-I said goodbye, Stanley.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.800
Honey, we just saw Stanley leaving.
Are you all right?

23:23.867 --> 23:26.200
-I'm fine.
-I wouldn't be fine.

23:26.533 --> 23:29.567
I don't know what I would have done
if Charlie had suddenly paid a visit.

23:29.633 --> 23:31.467
He's dead. You would have fainted.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.667
Are you... are you really all right?

23:36.500 --> 23:38.100
I'm feeling a little better.

23:38.433 --> 23:40.834
And tomorrow you're gonna feel
a lot better.

23:40.900 --> 23:42.834
And the next day maybe better still.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.433
-And the next day--
-That's right, Dorothy.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.500
And then one day, Stanley's gonna be out
of your life completely.

23:50.467 --> 23:51.700
Not completely.

23:52.967 --> 23:56.066
No, there'll always be a little part
of him that stays with me.

23:56.567 --> 23:58.500
Of course, Dorothy. After 38 years,

23:58.567 --> 24:01.800
there are always bound to be some
memories that stay with you.

24:01.867 --> 24:04.033
I wasn't talking about memories.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.333
I was talking about this.
