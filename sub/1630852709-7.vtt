00:09.634 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:13.805


00:13.888 --> 00:15.015


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:32.198 --> 00:34.325


00:34.409 --> 00:37.454


00:38.079 --> 00:40.498


00:41.291 --> 00:43.668
Mmm….

00:44.419 --> 00:46.463
Ooh…

00:47.672 --> 00:50.341
Summon the warrior within.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.302
Summon the warrior within.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.221


00:55.305 --> 00:57.390
Just gonna get nice and limber here.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.101
Come on, hamstrings. Don't fail me now!

01:00.185 --> 01:02.645


01:02.729 --> 01:04.981
Yay! Pudding! Hee hee hee!

01:05.065 --> 01:06.274
Pudding time.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.650


01:09.194 --> 01:11.196
-Pudding!

01:16.910 --> 01:18.244
Right here! Right here! Oh!

01:26.628 --> 01:28.171
Pudding for you, Red!

01:29.422 --> 01:30.757
Some for you, Bomb!

01:32.550 --> 01:34.677
I got you, Stella!

01:53.655 --> 01:55.031
-Aww.
-Huh?

02:05.166 --> 02:06.918
Why does this always happen?

02:07.001 --> 02:08.795
None of the hatchlings got pudding.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.131
Lunch Lady Brenda never makes enough.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.757
I mean, how hard could it be?!

02:12.841 --> 02:14.592
Yo, Rod!

02:14.676 --> 02:15.885
Totally agree.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.720
How about we team up and fix it?

02:17.804 --> 02:20.265
We? Like us? Together?

02:21.349 --> 02:24.102
Do you have pudding trauma?
And it's-- it's Red, by the way.

02:24.185 --> 02:28.398
Seeing you getting so worked up there
moved me. Deeply.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.900
Can I share something
I never told anyone?

02:30.984 --> 02:32.277
I'd rather you didn't.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.487
-When I was a hatchling--
-Okay then.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.864
I never got pudding.

02:35.947 --> 02:39.117
-I never got pudding either.
-Don't listen to him, Red!

02:39.200 --> 02:41.244
It's a bad idea.
I mean, a really bad idea!

02:41.327 --> 02:43.872
Because Neiderflyer despises us, right?
I mean, right?

02:43.955 --> 02:47.083
I know that we've had
our disagreements in the past.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.795
But if there's one thing
that should unite us, it's pudding.

02:50.879 --> 02:55.592
I do love pudding… and clouds,
and socks… old toothbrushes.

02:55.675 --> 02:59.137
Red, you're not seriously
listening to this bird feed, are you?!

02:59.220 --> 03:00.179
No.

03:07.770 --> 03:11.566
But pudding is the most important meal
of the day.

03:11.649 --> 03:12.984
Walk with me, bro.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.032
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

03:21.784 --> 03:26.372
Ohh. Your cabin is chickin' amazing.
How'd you get all this stuff?

03:26.456 --> 03:29.876
Pulled a few tail feathers. I can kind of
get away with whatever I want.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.295
Yeah, I know. It's your worst quality.

03:32.378 --> 03:37.383
Right. So Rod, like I said, this has
bothered me for a while.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.637
So I put together everything you need
to break into the kitchen

03:40.720 --> 03:43.389
and make sure there's enough pudding
for the hatchlings.

03:45.016 --> 03:50.188
Flight vision goggles, two-way radios…
soda machine.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.982
Whoa! What's the soda machine for?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.777
Uh, soda?

03:55.860 --> 03:58.321
Anyway, I'm just missing one piece:

03:58.404 --> 04:00.448
you and your… friends.

04:00.531 --> 04:01.699
Why would you need us?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.868
I'm a troublemaker.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.079
You're the guy who fixes things.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.706
The hatchlings need a hero.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.042
I need a hero.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.628
Ptuuuuh…

04:18.091 --> 04:23.179
Ptuuuuh…

04:23.263 --> 04:24.430
So, ver--

04:24.514 --> 04:27.058
-Ptuuuuh…

04:29.143 --> 04:31.312
Uh, looks like you got
a little on you there.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.482
So… you in, Rod?

04:34.565 --> 04:38.486
Uh, it's Red. And yeah, we'll do it.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.530
But how are we gonna
get out of our activities?

04:40.613 --> 04:42.031
With these.

04:44.158 --> 04:46.828
Cool! Dummy us'es!

04:48.162 --> 04:50.790
Although I feel like
I'm making a weird face there.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.216
Uhh!

05:01.175 --> 05:03.344
Archery's awesome!

05:03.428 --> 05:04.345
Yay!

05:04.429 --> 05:05.972
Bull's-eye!

05:07.473 --> 05:08.558
Psst!

05:10.601 --> 05:12.687
He's alive! Alive!

05:12.770 --> 05:15.940
I'm so, so happy!
We thought you were gone forever!

05:16.024 --> 05:19.235
Oh, man. I'd have loved
to see Neiderflyer's dumb face

05:19.319 --> 05:20.778
when you told him where to go.

05:20.862 --> 05:24.240
Right, right! 'Cause he's always
doing awful, awful, awful things to you.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.577
Yeah… like that time you got
trapped upside down on the slide

05:27.660 --> 05:30.163
and he took a picture of your butt
and showed it to everyone.

05:30.246 --> 05:33.916
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but it's-- Wait, he did what to my butt?

05:37.962 --> 05:39.797
Look, we know Neiderflyer's a jerk.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.717
But if he can help us
get the hatchlings pudding,

05:42.800 --> 05:43.801
we gotta do it.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.470
I still don't trust him.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.346
But I trust Red.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.390
Okay. So how do we do it?

05:49.474 --> 05:50.975
With these.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.145
-Wow.
-Whoa.

05:54.228 --> 05:57.106
Whoa! This looks just like you!

05:57.190 --> 05:58.357
Ah…

06:01.444 --> 06:03.780
Neiderflyer gave us everything we need.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.783
Dang right he did!
He even give us a theme song!

06:06.866 --> 06:08.117
Check this out!

06:14.957 --> 06:17.794
Hey, are you dummies gonna shoot or what?

06:23.841 --> 06:24.759
Ready?

06:24.842 --> 06:25.843
-Oh, yeah!
-Yeah!

06:26.761 --> 06:29.347
Yahoo!

06:29.430 --> 06:31.307
Whee hee-hee-hee!

06:31.390 --> 06:33.142
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

06:39.941 --> 06:42.902
-Uhh!
-Yahoo!

06:42.985 --> 06:44.195
Ack!

06:44.278 --> 06:45.655
Wow.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.865
Neiderjerk actually came through.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.784
See? Maybe he's not such a bad--

06:49.867 --> 06:51.869
Don't say it. Don't even think it.

06:52.411 --> 06:55.540
Let's get as much pudding
in the cannon as we can.

06:55.623 --> 06:56.916
Already on it!

06:56.999 --> 06:59.252
A bit of this, a bit of this…

07:00.753 --> 07:03.631
A bit of this… a dash more of this here.

07:12.181 --> 07:15.601
Uh, you don't think we overdid it, do you?
It does not sound happy.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.647
Uh, I'm sure it'll be fine.

07:19.730 --> 07:23.151
The important thing is that the hatchlings
are finally getting pudding.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.820
What's going on in here?

07:25.903 --> 07:27.238
Agh! Busted.

07:29.365 --> 07:34.662
Well, well, well, Rod and his goons
sabotaging the pudding cannon.

07:34.745 --> 07:37.248
What? No! This was your idea!

07:37.331 --> 07:38.624
He was in on this.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.294
I mean, we did it,
but it was all his idea!

07:41.377 --> 07:43.921
I don't care whose idea it was.

07:44.005 --> 07:47.383
You're banned from pudding
for the rest of the summer.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.263
No more pudding?
I don't wanna be banned.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.098
I dunno. I always wanted to be in a band.

07:58.728 --> 08:02.940
I really thought Neiderflyer wasn't
acting like his usual jerk self this time.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.901
-And yet…
-We told you not to trust him,

08:04.984 --> 08:08.196
but you said we should trust you,
so we did trust you, and now I can't stop!

08:10.656 --> 08:14.076
This just hurts, Red. It hurts so much.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.540
I am gonna go give Neiderflyer
a piece of my mind!

08:23.044 --> 08:25.421
Ooh. Thank you!

08:29.884 --> 08:33.346
'Sup, Splinterwoodies?
There's something you need to hear.

08:33.429 --> 08:38.434
Neiderflyer! It's time that everyone
heard exactly what you did.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.188
Neiderflyer tricked me
into convincing my friends

08:42.271 --> 08:43.356
to break into the kitchen,

08:43.439 --> 08:45.733
then ratted us out to Lunch Lady Brenda!

08:45.816 --> 08:47.652
-Oh, he's right.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.112
That's exactly what I did.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.907
Aha! You see? He admits it!

08:52.990 --> 08:54.742
He admits that he got the four of us

08:54.825 --> 08:56.953
banned from pudding
for the rest of the summer,

08:57.036 --> 09:01.374
which means there's now enough pudding
for the-- one, two, three, four--

09:01.457 --> 09:02.833
hatchlings.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.962
And that's how
I got the hatchlings pudding.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.129
A-boom.

09:07.213 --> 09:11.259
Neiderflyer!
Neiderflyer! Neiderflyer! Neiderflyer!

09:19.100 --> 09:21.811
Aw, what's the point?

09:21.894 --> 09:25.147
Neiderflyer, you win. Why don't you
just put me out of my misery?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.441
No! Red, what are you doing?!

09:27.525 --> 09:32.530
There's so much to live for!
Clouds, socks, uh, other stuff!

09:32.613 --> 09:36.659
I'm done. This is Neiderflyer's world
and I don't wanna live in it anymore.

09:36.742 --> 09:40.329
If you insist.
Looks like it's pudding time.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.294
Uh-oh…

09:49.171 --> 09:50.172
Ohh!

09:58.848 --> 10:01.642


10:01.726 --> 10:03.978
You were right
about the pudding cannon, Chuck.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.187
It really wasn't happy.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.897
It probably just needed a hug.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.025
Gotta admit, that was pretty smart, Red.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.319
Ah, justice was served.

10:11.402 --> 10:14.322
Mmm. Tapioca justice.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.906
Speaking of which…

10:19.535 --> 10:21.746
He's gonna find a way out of there,
you know.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.832
Yep, and he's gonna be the same
entitled jerk as before…

10:24.915 --> 10:27.710
but the important thing is
the hatchlings got pudding.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.713
We might not get the credit,
but we got the job done.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.424
And really, isn't that what heroes--

10:33.507 --> 10:34.842
Oh!

10:34.925 --> 10:36.761
Oh, come on. Are you kidding me?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.598
What? You weren't gonna eat that,
were you?
