00:01.625 --> 00:03.041
Record one song with me.

00:03.125 --> 00:06.125
Word on the street is you're doing
a solo record with Mantra?

00:06.208 --> 00:08.125
-Everybody thinks the band is breaking up.
-Solution?

00:08.208 --> 00:10.875
We could play a gig for the fans so they
could see that we're staying together.

00:10.959 --> 00:12.625
You think we could pull that off?

00:12.959 --> 00:15.000
Stella Malone, will you be my girlfriend?

00:15.083 --> 00:18.208
-Yes.
-Say, Joe, what's your big secret?

00:18.291 --> 00:21.083
Mona offered me the starring role
in the sequel to <i>Forever April.</i>

00:21.166 --> 00:22.875
-How long will you be gone?
-A long time.

00:22.959 --> 00:24.709
Hey, Mace, where's Stella?

00:24.792 --> 00:27.125
She's gone.
Aunt Lisa's driving her to the airport.

00:27.208 --> 00:28.458
<i>Stella's going home.</i>

00:31.458 --> 00:34.458
Hurry up, Kevin!
Anything from Stella?

00:34.542 --> 00:38.041
No, she's not answering.
She's gone dark. She is off the grid.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.542
Macy, breathe, OK?

00:39.625 --> 00:41.500
Aunt Lisa is just taking
Stella to the airport.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.583
<i>I'm sorry.</i> It's just that
my best friend suddenly skipped town,

00:43.667 --> 00:46.166
-so, yes, I'm a little freaked out.
-Well, I'm gonna get her back...

00:46.250 --> 00:49.125
if my ride ever gets down here.
Kevin Percy!

00:49.208 --> 00:51.542
-Don't call me Percy.
-What took you so long?

00:51.625 --> 00:53.583
-I couldn't find my driving gloves.
-Oh, right.

00:53.667 --> 00:56.333
Because your delicate hands are way
more important than losing Stella forever.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.250
Just buckle up.
Let's roll.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.458
-Get her back, Joe!
-Preferably before the gig.

you'd be temperamental, too.

Macy, I'm fine. I just couldn't take
the Joe drama anymore.

Listen to me,
if you get on that plane,

03:05.250 --> 03:07.083
you will lose any chance

03:07.166 --> 03:10.041
-Please don't try to talk me out of this.
-I just want you to think about it.

That's just it!
I'm tired of thinking about it.

03:12.917 --> 03:16.125
I'm tired of talking about it.
I'm just... tired.

03:16.208 --> 03:18.208
I want this summer to be over.

03:18.291 --> 03:20.291
Ah, she said she just wants
the summer to be over.

03:20.375 --> 03:21.792
-Let me talk to her.
-OK.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.500
Stella, it's Nick.
Listen--

-Put Macy back on.
-Copy that.

03:27.125 --> 03:30.750
-Joe is coming to get you.

-Yep.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.500

03:55.583 --> 03:59.166
I remember when my rocker boyfriend
came after me... oh.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.250
-What happened?
-Nothing.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.417
He just wanted to make sure
I was really leaving.

04:07.291 --> 04:08.750
-Cool.
-Yeah.

Oh, wait, Joe, I forgot my driving scarf.

-Go!
-Sorry.

[tires squeal]

04:23.375 --> 04:25.542
You were right about rock stars,
Aunt Lisa.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.792
They always break your heart.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.917
Oh, I do say that a lot, don't I?

04:31.875 --> 04:35.667
You know, everyone has a song to sing
and that one's yours.

04:35.959 --> 04:39.417
Yeah, but, honey,
Joe might be different.

04:40.208 --> 04:43.542
Oh, are you kidding me?
Please don't go soft on me now.

04:43.625 --> 04:45.458
Look, I know I've been tough on Joe

04:45.542 --> 04:48.917
and I've tried to protect you,
but when you two finally got together--

04:49.000 --> 04:50.917
-Yeah, for one day.
-I know, I know.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.208
But it was the happiest
I'd seen you all summer.

04:54.834 --> 04:57.083
Are you sure this is
how you want it to end?

04:57.792 --> 05:00.208
Is there ever a good way for it to end?

05:03.083 --> 05:07.625
If this is what you really want,
then I'm on team Stella.

05:10.083 --> 05:12.041
You really are the cool aunt.

05:14.083 --> 05:15.583
I'm gonna miss you.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.667
[sputtering]

05:24.333 --> 05:26.917
-Oh.
-Why are we stopping?

05:27.083 --> 05:30.458
There's no positive spin on this:
we're out of cooking oil.

05:30.542 --> 05:32.625
Kevin, Stella's probably boarding
her plane right now.

05:32.709 --> 05:34.375
We're like a mile away from the airport.

05:34.458 --> 05:36.250
I know.
I'm really sorry.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.208
[sniffs]
Do you smell that?

05:38.291 --> 05:40.583
-I hate this game.
-No...

05:41.583 --> 05:44.166
It's a burger truck!
We can fuel up.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.917
-I'm not hungry!
-Not us, the car. Come on.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.250
OK.

05:51.083 --> 05:54.834
-Um, excuse me, Gus!
-Gus!

05:55.458 --> 05:58.709
Please, my friends call me Greasy.

05:59.417 --> 06:02.709
Whoa!
You're the two dudes from Jonas.

06:03.291 --> 06:06.291
-Sorry about the breakup, boys.
-We're not breaking up!

06:06.375 --> 06:08.417
Listen, we're in a tough spot.
Do you think you could spare

06:08.500 --> 06:10.417
about five gallons
of cooking oil for my car?

06:10.500 --> 06:12.875
Oh, cool.

06:12.959 --> 06:15.166
Keeping it green, I like that.

06:15.750 --> 06:20.041
Sorry, boys, I just recycled the last
of my used cooking oil this morning.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.542
Oh, come on,
you gotta have something back there.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.125
I really need to get to the airport.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.709
Hey, you should go
to my brother's truck.

06:25.792 --> 06:28.583
-That guy never recycles his cooking oil.
-Where's your brother?

06:28.667 --> 06:32.166
-Jail, man!
-For not replacing his cooking oil?

06:32.250 --> 06:35.375
No, man, for stealing my mom's monkey.

06:35.458 --> 06:38.709
That's it. I've got to get to Stella
before she gets on that plane.

warm up the crowd a little bit.

11:20.417 --> 11:22.834
Are you kidding me?
The whole purpose of this gig

11:22.917 --> 11:24.333
is to show the fans
that you're not going solo,

11:24.417 --> 11:28.000
so you going out there solo would be
the opposite of you not going solo.

So, what do we do?

11:32.625 --> 11:34.500
[exhales]

11:36.166 --> 11:38.041
It's Macy time.

11:38.750 --> 11:41.625
-What does that mean exactly?
-I've got this.

11:41.709 --> 11:43.917
[chanting continues] Jonas, Jonas, Jonas!

11:44.000 --> 11:45.583
[cheering]

11:46.208 --> 11:48.083
What's up, LA?

11:49.792 --> 11:53.542
Well, I know all of you are here
to see your favorite band, Jonas.

11:53.625 --> 11:58.333
[cheering]

11:58.417 --> 12:00.250
OK, chill, guys,
they'll be out in just a bit.

12:00.333 --> 12:03.625
But until then,
who wants to hear some jokes?

12:03.709 --> 12:06.875
-[booing]
-[Macy] No, no, no, no!

12:06.959 --> 12:09.208
You guys will love it, trust me.
It killed at Thanksgiving.

12:09.291 --> 12:11.667
OK, so two penguins approach each other,

12:11.750 --> 12:15.583
and one says, "You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo."

12:15.667 --> 12:18.166
No wait, I messed that up.
Hold on, give me a second.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.208
[booing]

12:22.417 --> 12:24.375
OK, OK, I got it! I got it!

12:24.458 --> 12:27.917
[chuckles] I got it.
So, two penguins approach each other,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.458
and one says, "It looks like
you're wearing a tuxedo."

12:30.542 --> 12:34.250
And then the other one says,
"How do you know I'm not?"

12:34.333 --> 12:36.333
[all groaning]

12:36.417 --> 12:37.792
[forced laughter]

12:37.875 --> 12:39.917
You stink!

12:40.000 --> 12:42.375
[crowd jeering]

12:49.333 --> 12:52.250
You know, Franz,
it's the same story in any language.

12:52.333 --> 12:55.917
Guy screws up, guy loses the girl,
he never gets a second chance.

12:58.792 --> 13:00.291
Thanks for listening to me.

13:02.959 --> 13:05.750
<i>Auf wiedersehen,</i> dude.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.208
I think I just got my second chance.

13:17.625 --> 13:18.709
Stella!

13:19.542 --> 13:21.375
What are you doing here?

13:22.208 --> 13:24.709
I came to say I'm sorry
and to stop you from leaving.

13:26.583 --> 13:28.125
What are you doing here?

13:28.792 --> 13:30.959
[crying]
I couldn't get on my plane.

13:31.041 --> 13:33.625
-That's good.
-No, it's not.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.709
It means that staying here
didn't feel right,

13:36.792 --> 13:39.959
but neither did leaving, so here I am,

13:40.041 --> 13:42.875
sitting on my suitcase,
wondering where I belong.

13:44.375 --> 13:48.500
-You belong with me.
-Joe, we tried this.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.667
-Where are you going?
-It doesn't work!

13:51.750 --> 13:53.834
And nothing that you can say
is going to change it.

13:53.917 --> 13:54.917
I love you!

13:57.417 --> 14:00.166
-What?
-I love you.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.834
I love that I remember
what you look like with braces.

14:05.041 --> 14:08.208
I love that you'll spend an hour
picking out bandanas with me.

14:08.291 --> 14:10.083
I love that the whole summer
you were in the pool,

14:10.166 --> 14:13.542
-and you managed not to get your hair wet.
-[chuckles and sniffs]

14:13.625 --> 14:15.333
I love that when anything
good happens to me,

14:15.417 --> 14:17.458
the first person
I want to tell is you.

14:17.542 --> 14:19.750
-Joe--
-I don't care!

14:19.834 --> 14:22.917
I want everyone to know
I love Stella Malone!

14:23.000 --> 14:23.959
Joe.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.709
If I say, "I love you, too,"
will you be quiet?

14:27.250 --> 14:28.583
Yes.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.458
I love you, too.

14:33.208 --> 14:36.792
-[woman] Aww.
-[applause]

14:46.959 --> 14:49.166
Well, this has been
an interesting summer.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.417
How do we make this work?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.709
I have no idea.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.834
I guess we just live in the moment.

14:57.917 --> 15:00.333
I'm really enjoying this moment.

15:02.417 --> 15:04.583
-Moment over.
-Why?

15:04.667 --> 15:06.709
You're really late for your show.

15:07.375 --> 15:09.750
-Like, really late.
-Yeah, let's go, come on.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.291
It is so simple.
They're penguins.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.375
They all look like
they're wearing tuxedoes.

15:20.458 --> 15:23.667
But this one penguin was messing
with the other penguin so he says,

15:23.750 --> 15:25.875
"How do you know
I'm not wearing a tuxedo?"

15:25.959 --> 15:28.917
But of course he's not because
he's a stinking penguin!

15:29.000 --> 15:32.250
-They don't even make tuxedoes that small!
-[cheering]

15:32.834 --> 15:35.166
Oh! [chuckles]
OK, that's better.

15:40.792 --> 15:43.166
Oh, wow.

15:43.250 --> 15:46.625
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Jonas!

now that the summer's almost over?

with the legendary Mantra.
