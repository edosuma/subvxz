-[reporter 2] KJ! Can we get a comment?

00:21.938 --> 00:24.524
-[camera shutters clicking]
-[reporter 3] Look this way, please!

00:26.609 --> 00:27.485
KJ!

00:27.569 --> 00:29.070
-Right here!
-[reporter] Ms. Harper!

00:29.154 --> 00:30.947
[reporters continue chattering]

00:31.072 --> 00:32.365
-KJ!
-[reporter] Ms. Harper!

00:51.342 --> 00:53.511
-[Wilcox] Yeah! All right, baby!
-[whistling, clapping]

00:53.595 --> 00:55.096
You're almost there. Almost there.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.516
-Almost out of the woods, baby.
-I told you we'd get past this.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.394
Three down, one to go.
Fuck that prosecutor.

01:01.478 --> 01:05.356
And that's thanks to you.
You and your brass fucking balls.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.362
We need to make a statement,
press our advantage.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.823
Stand behind me, keep your mouth shut.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.579
It is over.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.252
Let's go.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.005
[Sam]<i> My client is a victim</i>
<i>of a hate-fueled campaign</i>

01:29.088 --> 01:31.591
by a race-baiting zealot of a prosecutor.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.676
Ms. Harper is making a name for herself,

01:33.760 --> 01:37.972
but police officers who risk their lives
every day for us are paying the price.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.599
Officer Jablonski,
a number of your colleagues

01:39.682 --> 01:41.893
have been calling in sick,
not reporting for duty,

01:41.976 --> 01:44.062
and now the city's facing
a surge of violent crime.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.273
As far as what's going to stop
the unrest, who knows?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.484
The governor calling in
the National Guard?

01:49.567 --> 01:50.693
Another dead cop?

01:50.777 --> 01:54.114
There were 64 police officers killed
in the line of duty this past year.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.491
Well, our son was murdered this year.

01:56.574 --> 01:59.536
Along with too many black boys
to even count. So you do that math.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.664
-Okay, thank you for your time.
-Well, where's your outrage for them?

02:03.081 --> 02:05.083
Where's the outrage for my son?

02:05.792 --> 02:07.836
-What if it was your child?
-[reporters clamoring]

02:07.961 --> 02:09.712
Where are our children in all of this?

02:09.796 --> 02:11.673
[woman]
Mrs. Butler, how can this be a hate crime

02:11.756 --> 02:13.967
if the officer didn't know
your son was black?

02:14.050 --> 02:16.928
We're simple people, we don't have money
for fancy lawyers like you.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.847
-But we work hard.
-[man] Was your son in a gang--

02:18.930 --> 02:20.932
We live life right,
we just want what's fair.

02:21.015 --> 02:24.060
-[protestors yelling indistinctly]
-We deserve justice!

02:24.144 --> 02:26.229
Our son deserves justice!

02:27.522 --> 02:29.357
[woman on TV]

<i>It was a stunning mistake</i>

<i>And as you can see,</i>
<i>the response from the public,</i>

02:40.785 --> 02:43.746

02:43.830 --> 02:44.914
[turns TV off]

02:45.248 --> 02:46.749
-Get up!
-[KJ moans]

02:47.584 --> 02:48.960
We got work to do!

02:49.335 --> 02:52.255
I know you've got a "Fuck off" in there,
so let it out now, save some time.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.298
Gonna make coffee.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.008
I'm out of coffee.

02:56.217 --> 02:59.012
-I want to watch TV.
-I fucked up.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.431
I let that kid die. Now get up.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.433
-I can't.
-You do it.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.767
-[KJ groans]
-God!

03:05.184 --> 03:06.019
[KJ moans]

03:06.102 --> 03:09.230
Pull yourself together. Come on. Jesus!

03:09.314 --> 03:10.231
Whoa.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.775
[Fish sighs]

03:13.735 --> 03:14.861
No, I...

03:16.279 --> 03:18.698
I walked right into it.

03:19.157 --> 03:23.661
I just handed her this prop
for her goddamned show-and-tell.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.373
-I fucking blew it.
-Join the fucking club.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.918
Doesn't mean you get to take your ball
and go home.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.962
It doesn't matter. He's not going away.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.382
You do realize
he's not gonna do any real time.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.676
-We still have death by auto.
-We have shit.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.012
-And get off of me! I can walk!
-Okay, then--

03:41.095 --> 03:41.930
Ow!

03:43.223 --> 03:44.599
-Really?
-[KJ sighs]

03:45.016 --> 03:48.394
I picked up the purchase report
from Jablonski's blue SUV.

03:48.478 --> 03:52.523
Oh, Jesus.
We looked at that a million fucking times.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.860
Yeah, but we never looked
for the grille guard.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.820
Look.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.156
It was there
when Marie Jablonski bought the car,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.492
but not when he drove to the hospital
the morning of the hit-and-run.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.826
See? It's gone.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.497
And I checked the hospital footage
for the day before the accident.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.083
They had a visit with the doctor
and it was there.

04:10.625 --> 04:14.045
-[sighs] So?
-So, it could be direct evidence

04:14.128 --> 04:16.381
linking Jablonski to the accident.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.258
Forensics can match it
with Brenton's injuries.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.594
You can make the case
that this specific car hit Brenton.

04:21.678 --> 04:25.932
It's gone, with the car,
with every fucking thing, and--

04:26.015 --> 04:29.435
You've got two choices here:
you crawl back in that bottle and you die,

04:29.519 --> 04:32.939
or you get up off your ass
and do your job.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.233
We broke a lot of promises.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.696
Pretty fucking epic ones.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.864
We don't get to quit.

04:45.201 --> 04:48.037
Bring up the grille guard in court
and see who flinches.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.837
<i>Ain't nobody tryin' to see him</i>
<i>play the black papa.</i>

04:55.920 --> 04:57.171

04:57.255 --> 04:58.464
<i>Ciao.</i>

04:59.507 --> 05:00.842

[DiAngelo]
Your mom's gone, God rest her soul,

05:03.303 --> 05:06.222
and you still sucking them
fucking cancer sticks.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.641
One of my vices. We all got 'em.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.853
Like you with that cop Jablonski.

05:11.936 --> 05:15.481
The advice was free, my time isn't.
I came here to talk business.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.858
Business?

05:17.400 --> 05:20.320
What, with all the trouble
your boy caused? Please.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.613
Time for me to find a new partner.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.533
One of you bitches
under every rock in the pond, man.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.493
The pond you refer to...

05:28.411 --> 05:29.996
is the size of a Dixie cup.

05:30.079 --> 05:34.042
You better be grateful for what you got
and you watch your fucking tone with me.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.627
I wonder what your boy Jablonski
would think

05:36.711 --> 05:40.590
when he finds out that you're the one
that put the nine mil in the uncle's hand?

05:41.007 --> 05:44.927
He won't. 'Cause you're
the only one privy. Ain't that right?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.471
[sirens wailing in distance]

05:48.264 --> 05:49.432
Blaze don't know.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.850
Nigga don't even fucking talk.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.602
But me?

05:52.685 --> 05:56.522
I'm a born conversationalist.
Fucking soliloquies and shit.

05:57.940 --> 06:00.359
You threatening me,
you cripple motherfucker?

06:00.860 --> 06:01.903
[Messiah] Look at you, man.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.740
You so soft for that boy,
it makes me wonder,

06:06.199 --> 06:10.203
that prosecutor drag my ass into court,
you gonna be soft then too?

06:12.455 --> 06:14.332
Throw me under the fucking bus?

06:23.049 --> 06:26.552
You should've fucked that little white boy
when you had the chance, man.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.226
[Messiah] What the fuck?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.233
[sniffs]

06:44.403 --> 06:46.280
You still good with 14 percent?

06:48.157 --> 06:50.201
-I'll make it work.
-Yeah, you will.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.913
Throw this piece of shit in the river.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.261
[sighs]

07:16.978 --> 07:18.187
[sighs]

07:21.941 --> 07:23.151
Father God,

07:23.734 --> 07:25.778
I come before you today to...

07:26.404 --> 07:30.032
ask for your help and your guidance
in Brenton's case.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.795
Why did you let this happen
to an innocent child?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.798
Where was your mercy?

07:48.217 --> 07:51.304
I can't even close my eyes
without seeing his...

07:52.138 --> 07:53.598
last seconds.

07:54.348 --> 07:56.476
How alone he must have been.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.021
Show me something.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.900
Show me something...

08:04.442 --> 08:07.570
besides what's in my head. Please.

08:09.739 --> 08:13.659
'Cause I can't see past it right now.

08:20.082 --> 08:23.503
Show me that you were there with him.

08:24.629 --> 08:25.713
Please.

08:31.928 --> 08:32.887
[sighs]

08:34.055 --> 08:36.265
[inhales and exhales sharply]

08:38.142 --> 08:40.603
[protestors, group 1] Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

08:40.686 --> 08:43.022
[protestors, group 2] Blue lives matter!
Blue lives matter!

08:43.105 --> 08:45.650
Blue lives matter! Blue lives matter!

08:45.733 --> 08:47.360
She's gonna push to have
all charges dismissed,

08:47.443 --> 08:49.862
so you have to convince the judge
on this grille guard business.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.864
-Yeah, I know.
-Emphasize, use the actual words,

08:51.948 --> 08:54.617
-see if one of them cracks.
-Will you give me some space here, okay?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.077
[KJ sighs]

09:09.131 --> 09:11.050
I thought she was the one
with the conscience.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.136
She was.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.054
[door opens]

09:16.264 --> 09:17.265
[deputy] All rise.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.477
Court is now in session. The honorable
Judge Robert Dolan presiding.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.812
[Dolan] Please be seated.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.148
Outbursts like the one yesterday
will not be tolerated.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.067
I hope I am making myself very clear.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.153
Ms. Hennessy, before I recall the jury,

09:31.237 --> 09:33.656
I'll hear arguments
on your motion to dismiss.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.657
[Sam] Yes, Your Honor.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.244
Given that we heard testimony
from the State's own witness

09:38.327 --> 09:41.247
proving that the victim's race
was indeterminable,

09:41.706 --> 09:45.001
I move to dismiss the hate crime charge
against my client.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.338
Furthermore, the State hasn't proven
any elements of the other charges.

09:49.422 --> 09:53.426
-Therefore, I move to dismiss all charges.
-This is a gross overreach, Your Honor.

09:53.509 --> 09:56.012
The State is far from finished
presenting its case.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.931
Upon redirect with Mr. Lee,
we will establish evidence

09:59.015 --> 10:02.476
directly tying Officer Jablonski's car
to the accident.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.357
The defendant's SUV originally
had a grille guard attached to the front.

10:08.941 --> 10:12.278
We believe it sustained the lion's share
of the accident impact.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.872
[Sam] For the prosecution to introduce
new evidence at this late stage--

10:22.955 --> 10:24.498
[KJ] Hardly new evidence, Your Honor.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.627
It's a separate line of questioning
based on evidence already in record.

10:27.710 --> 10:32.256
Evidence which, even if true, is nowhere
near establishing my client's guilt.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.135
I think that's for the jury to decide,
Ms. Hennessy. Not you.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.805
And the State will be presenting
further evidence

10:39.889 --> 10:41.599
substantiating the hate crime charge.

10:43.017 --> 10:46.020
I'll give you some leeway, Ms. Harper,
but not much.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.147
Defense's motion to dismiss is denied.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.025
Your Honor, I still need time to prepare.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.234
You have an hour.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.904
Then I'll be bringing the jury back in
to hear testimony.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.822
Court stands in recess until 2:00 p.m.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.706
Should I be worried?

11:15.007 --> 11:16.050
Right.

11:18.594 --> 11:19.553
We're good.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.516
Trice.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.604
Did you know about Brenton?

11:29.563 --> 11:31.023
I had thoughts.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.443
I believed he told me everything.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.444
[chuckles]

11:36.404 --> 11:38.155
Well, you raised him so he could.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.658
I'm not sure I did.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.704
Isaiah, I had no right to say that to you.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.083
To say that you didn't love him.
I know you did.

11:56.632 --> 11:57.758
[sighs]

12:03.556 --> 12:06.475
-What the fuck is going on?
-Shut the fuck up, man.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.395
-The prosecutor knows where it is?
-If she did, it'd be on display right now,

12:09.478 --> 12:10.563
front and center.

12:13.732 --> 12:16.152
If Jablonski cracks,
that grille guard's the only thing

12:16.235 --> 12:18.904
guaranteeing this shit lands
squarely on him.

12:18.988 --> 12:19.989
All right?

12:20.739 --> 12:23.826
You think I'm gonna listen to you
of all people on strategy?

12:23.909 --> 12:24.994
[chuckles]

12:26.203 --> 12:27.288
Yeah.

12:27.788 --> 12:32.334
'Cause out of all of us,
my hands are the only ones stayed clean.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.056
-Doing okay? Look a little queasy.
-Get outta my face.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.434
If you're not feeling well,
you should go to the hospital.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.895
Maybe have the doctor take a look
at those scratches on your arm.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.400
Did she look you in the eye
when you shoved the needle in her?

12:59.361 --> 13:01.405
Oh, you motherfucker, it was you.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.034
Hey, you better believe
I'm coming right at you.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.499
[man] The presence of a grille guard
could certainly account

13:11.582 --> 13:15.252
for the low number of paint samples
found in the victim's hair, yes.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.631
Are Brenton Butler's injuries consistent
with this type of grille guard?

13:18.714 --> 13:19.548
[man] They are.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.886
[KJ] Mr. Lee, can you show the jury
which of the victim's wounds

13:23.969 --> 13:25.971
match the pattern
of the defendant's grille guard?

13:26.055 --> 13:28.641
[Lee] These marks on the victim's scalp

13:28.724 --> 13:31.310
at the anterior side of the skull

13:31.393 --> 13:34.438
match the metal rod
on this particular grille guard.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.274
-Objection, Your Honor.
-[KJ] On what grounds?

13:37.358 --> 13:39.360
[Dolan] Counselors, approach the bench.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.821
Your Honor, this is a blatant attempt

13:42.905 --> 13:45.157
to interrupt the flow
of this witness' testimony.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.869
I'd like to renew my argument
the trial be continued

13:48.953 --> 13:50.871
until after I have a chance
to study this new evidence.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.207
[KJ] Your Honor,
you already ruled on this motion.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.876
[Sam] That was until I understood
the scope of the State's questions.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.462
[KJ] The State should at least be allowed
to finish questioning.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.841
[Sam] Your Honor, the defense needs
ample time to study this new evidence.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.177
At least over this coming weekend.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.263
-[Sam continues indistinctly]
-[Teresa gasps]

14:07.388 --> 14:08.347
[woman] Oh, my God!

14:08.430 --> 14:09.598
-[man] Back up!
-[Wilcox] T!

14:10.975 --> 14:13.435
-[man] Come on, give her some room!
-[low chatter]

14:13.853 --> 14:16.355
-[Marie] Teresa!
-[Wilcox] Take it easy, take it easy.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.274
-[man] She's all right.
-[Wilcox] Easy, easy.

14:28.576 --> 14:32.621
Oh, my God, you're shaking like a leaf
and you're so pale.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.708
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Stop, I'm fine, I told you.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.628
But you're not fine.
You just passed out in there.

14:40.754 --> 14:44.300
You need to take her to the urgent care.
She needs to see a doctor.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.718
-No.
-No, she don't.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.222
We got news.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.849
What news?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.311
I guess she's still got that conscience.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.396
-Oh, my God! [laughs]
-Yeah.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.110
None of the others even blinked
at the mention of the grille guard.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.279
Osorio's the one that killed Nadine.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.490
He's got scratch marks
up and down his arm.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.701
[KJ]<i> I can get one of the office</i>
<i>detectives to follow Teresa.</i>

15:10.784 --> 15:12.536
You probably shouldn't be around them.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.662
I'm doing this.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.206
<i>Something to keep in mind though</i>
<i>about this crew</i>

15:16.290 --> 15:17.917
and how they handle loose ends,

15:18.959 --> 15:20.461
Messiah's missing too.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.879
They're cleaning house.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.882
Which means we need to be extra careful
with how we handle Teresa.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.801
<i>Look, offer her immunity,</i>
<i>just whatever you need.</i>

15:27.885 --> 15:30.930
I'll do some research,
dig up any skeletons if I can.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.683
Just don't let her out of your sight,
okay?

15:35.517 --> 15:38.103
-Mrs. Butler.
-Today went well, right?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.606
The testimony today establishes damage.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.441
Is it enough to put him away?

15:43.192 --> 15:46.445
Probably not.
Uh, but court's in recess until Monday

15:46.528 --> 15:49.907
and I have another lead.
It could be the break that we need.

15:50.282 --> 15:54.662
That man has the cops, the press,
the entire justice system on his side.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.374
I have you.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.643
[indistinct chatter]

16:33.951 --> 16:35.786
[siren wailing in distance]

17:27.254 --> 17:29.089
[gasps] Get the fuck outta here.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.719
We need to get you to a hospital.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.721
-Don't touch me!
-All right. I won't, I won't.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.474
[whispers] Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

17:41.810 --> 17:42.895
How about...

17:44.938 --> 17:46.190
I just sit here?

17:51.695 --> 17:53.572
For as long as you want.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.497
[Teresa]
Seriously, you didn't have to do this.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.706
[Marie] Yeah, we did.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.043
-It's a big deal. You're having a baby.
-[rock music playing]

18:06.168 --> 18:08.879
-[men chatter indistinctly]
-[Marie] You need this, especially now.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.673
-[DiAngelo] Hey, come on, get off.
-[Marie] You gotta have some fun.

18:11.757 --> 18:12.966
[Teresa] Isn't that bad luck?

18:13.050 --> 18:16.762
-Hey, listen up. Ladies, shut up.
-[Marie] You're gonna be a great mom.

18:16.845 --> 18:17.846
All right, get up.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.975
I know it's early, but fuck it. We have
got to celebrate good news for once.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.727
Watch your fucking language, babe.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.146
Speech, speech, speech, speech.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.773
You're one hell of a cop.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.150
You're gonna be one hell of a dad.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.611
[Osorio] The fuck is the matter with you?
<i>¿Que te pasa, coño?</i>

18:32.736 --> 18:35.989
Yo, get the fuck off of me with that shit!
Are you serious?

18:36.073 --> 18:38.325
-No! No!
-Hey, hey, hey! Get the fuck off!

18:38.408 --> 18:40.452
-Walk away! Walk away!
-He's fucking drunk!

18:40.536 --> 18:41.787
-He's a fucking idiot.
-Bitch!

18:41.870 --> 18:43.539
Hey! Watch your fucking tone. All right?

18:43.622 --> 18:45.582
[Crystal] Come sit down. He's an asshole.

18:45.666 --> 18:48.043
[Jasmine] Don't know what's wrong
with him. He's acting crazy.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.504
-Manny, you know what's wrong?
-[Wilcox] Nah, it's nothing.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.840
-[Jasmine] He's not sleeping.
-[Wilcox] Forget about it.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.759
-[Marie] It's cute, right?
-[Crystal] It's so cute.

18:55.843 --> 18:59.138
Our kids are gonna grow up together,
just like we did.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.765
We're gonna be mommies together.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.478
You're gonna do great in court.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.814
I trust you.

19:10.983 --> 19:11.817
Mm-hmm.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.403
-All right? You drink with me.
-[rock music continues]

19:15.112 --> 19:16.029
<i>Salud.</i>

19:16.613 --> 19:17.698
Here's to us.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.743
To justice. Right?

19:22.619 --> 19:26.331
[women chuckling, chattering indistinctly]

19:29.209 --> 19:30.252
Fuck him.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.422
Fuck him.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.842
Petey, I need to tell you something.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.178
-DiAngelo--
-No, hey, hey.

19:39.261 --> 19:43.515
-I need to talk to you about something.
-Let me grab you another beer. All right?

19:44.016 --> 19:46.518
-I ain't going to let them hurt you.
-Hey, no.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.938
[Wilcox] No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.649
-You can't smoke, you're pregnant.
-Come on, stop, T.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.776
-You're pregnant.
-Come on, you gotta quit that shit.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.695
You want your kid to come out
with crab claws?

19:56.778 --> 19:59.990
I know a girl on the shore, her kid came
out with fucking pincers, I swear to God.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.993
-Oh, it's my last one. Promise.
-Come on, you don't need to do that.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.120
-Promise.
-Come on, stop, stop, stop.

20:21.261 --> 20:24.348
[tarp crackling]

20:46.286 --> 20:49.581
[muttering]
Fuck! What the fuck? What the fuck?

20:51.667 --> 20:52.709
[Fish] Hey.

20:54.670 --> 20:55.587
[chuckles]

20:55.671 --> 20:57.839
I guess congratulations are in order.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.009
-Little girls, man, they're the best.
-You're spying on us now?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.762
First time you see that face,
it's gonna break your heart.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.765
Break your kid's heart too, knowing
she's gotta visit you in the clink.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.934
Get out of here. You can't be here.
It's trespassing.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.936
I think it's good that you know the law.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.272
It means you know what an accessory is.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.192
So you know not talking
about those cops killing that kid

21:17.276 --> 21:20.279
and crushing his head under that SUV
that you like to drive around--

21:20.362 --> 21:22.030
You don't leave now,
I will call them out here.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.699
Let's do it. You should do it!

21:24.199 --> 21:25.200
Call them!

21:27.411 --> 21:29.705
Ask them about Nadine,
the other little kid they killed.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.541
What are you talking about?

21:36.503 --> 21:39.298
Yeah. She was 15 years old.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.049
She was gonna put 'em all away.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.092
Look at her.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.054
Your friends in there...

21:46.888 --> 21:49.766
left her to rot in some swamp.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.977
-Look at her!
-Stop it!

21:52.060 --> 21:54.646
They're worse than animals,

21:55.147 --> 21:56.356
those people in there.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.609
And they're all lying to you.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.653
Even that cousin of yours.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.490
-Don't talk about my cousin, you asshole.
-No. Why? Hey.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.327
You stay away from her,
you stay away from me!

22:08.410 --> 22:09.578
-Okay! Hey, okay!
-Hey, guys!

22:09.661 --> 22:11.079
Hey, shh.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.665
Know how to reach me
if you change your mind.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.500
Same place your old man works.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.096
[engine starts]

22:39.733 --> 22:41.276
[gasps]

22:41.359 --> 22:43.361
[breathing heavily]

22:44.738 --> 22:46.114
Come get breakfast.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.704
[woman on TV]<i> Whether or not</i>
<i>Brenton Butler was a gang member,</i>

22:52.788 --> 22:56.583
<i>the 15-year-old did in fact have</i>
<i>a juvenile record for drug possession.</i>

23:03.298 --> 23:04.800
All I got is cereal.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.053
That'll work.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.655
What about you and Mrs. Butler?

23:27.572 --> 23:29.491
Y'all ain't checking for each other
no more?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.372
Just saying, Brenton would've wanted
y'all to work it out.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.040
Ain't that what you want?

23:37.124 --> 23:38.583
Not everything's up to me.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.503
Finally made my peace with that.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.885
I am thinking about starting
a new job though.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.055
Doing what?

23:53.181 --> 23:54.182
Painting.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.477
Something I been into since I was a kid.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.437
So you trying to be an artist now?

23:59.980 --> 24:02.065
-Like museums and shit?
-Nah.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.442
Just, you know,
painting old houses, buildings.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.944
Putting some color back.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.028
Some light.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.156
Life.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.078
I might need some help
if you're interested in a job.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.788
I ain't no employee.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.290
Shit.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.750
If you're looking for a partner though...

24:21.585 --> 24:22.627
we could talk.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.213
I just might be.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.593
You know, you always got a place to stay
if you need it.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.986
I appreciate the offer, but...

24:48.820 --> 24:50.572
I got an aunt out in Mobile.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.158
She's been hitting me up for a while.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.993
Everything that's been going down,

24:55.076 --> 24:56.745
seems like a good idea.

24:58.038 --> 25:01.416
Think I could make it
as some country Alabama boy?

25:02.417 --> 25:03.418
I do.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.967
Dear Heavenly Father,
may you bless this food

25:11.676 --> 25:15.555
for the nourishment of our bodies,
minds, and spirits.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.307
Bless all our loved ones and...

25:17.807 --> 25:19.601
those who aren't here to be loved.

25:41.873 --> 25:42.999
I spooked her.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.169
She knows something,
but she's not talking.

25:46.253 --> 25:49.756
And she's in deeper than we thought too.
She's about to have Wilcox's demon child.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.174
But other than that... [scoffs]

25:51.967 --> 25:53.051
How about you?

25:53.134 --> 25:54.010
Nothing.

25:54.094 --> 25:56.721
Past jobs, old boyfriends,

25:56.805 --> 25:59.266
I couldn't come up with anything
to use as leverage.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.517
What about the cousin, Marie?

26:00.600 --> 26:03.353
One mention of her and she went nuts,
like a Pekingese on PCP.

26:03.436 --> 26:05.397
They grew up on the same block together.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.233
But if she's about to start a family
with Wilcox,

26:08.316 --> 26:10.193
there's no way
she's turning any of them in.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.695
What about the other witnesses?

26:12.112 --> 26:14.155
Messiah's AWOL, she's the last one.

26:14.656 --> 26:18.493
Without that grille guard,
auto death is mostly speculation.

26:18.576 --> 26:19.995
And hate crime's a Hail Mary.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.707
He had to have seen that blood
near the ditch.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.917
And those shoes,
they were right there in plain sight.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.877
Can't introduce the Timberlands
without Nadine.

26:27.961 --> 26:28.878
I know.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.630
But Jablonski must've seen them.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.174
If he did, he had to have known
there was a kid in that ditch.

26:33.258 --> 26:36.136
Have to do better than that.
"Must have's" are not gonna sway a jury.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.889
We got a couple hours before the trial.
I'm gonna help you prep.

26:40.015 --> 26:43.018
I'm gonna get some moo shu and we're
gonna do a little mock trial here.

26:43.101 --> 26:43.977
-No. No.
-Huh?

26:44.060 --> 26:47.188
You sat on Teresa all weekend,
you did your part.

26:48.064 --> 26:51.276
I just... I need to think, okay?

26:52.319 --> 26:53.611
Let me do my job.

26:53.695 --> 26:54.821
You sure?

26:55.447 --> 26:56.865
I do a mean Jersey girl.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.576
I already got the gum. See?

27:00.410 --> 27:01.328
Go.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.997
You're gonna do good tomorrow.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.874
-Goodnight, Fish.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.083

27:17.802 --> 27:19.012
[footsteps]

27:21.556 --> 27:23.224
[DiAngelo] I didn't mean to scare you.

27:24.392 --> 27:25.518
You didn't.

27:27.771 --> 27:31.358
You know what kind of message it sends,
you disrespecting me in public.

27:33.443 --> 27:36.780
-Don't walk away from me!
-I'm walking to my car, Officer.

27:36.863 --> 27:38.865
There's a time and a place
to discuss legal matters.

27:38.948 --> 27:41.618
How is it you still don't get
that we're a team?

27:44.120 --> 27:46.247
The N.A.P. wanted their best man
on this case,

27:46.331 --> 27:48.333
and like it or not, it was me.

27:49.334 --> 27:52.754
You wanna be a part of a team,
join a softball league.

27:53.588 --> 27:55.131
With a little more conviction.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.051
Excuse me?

27:59.094 --> 28:00.595
You didn't really own it.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.681
I caught a little quiver in your cheek.

28:05.266 --> 28:06.893
I got something for you.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.778
You want to shake her up tomorrow,
use this.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.280
What is it?

28:19.614 --> 28:22.117
That's a little thing called
"inherent bias."

28:22.200 --> 28:24.035
It works both ways.

28:25.578 --> 28:27.414
People gunning for us,

28:27.497 --> 28:29.332
'cause they can't raise their own families

28:29.416 --> 28:31.251
without asking us for our help.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.380
At the end of the day,

28:36.339 --> 28:39.759
this whole thing is one big clusterfuck
of Mommy and Daddy issues.

28:39.843 --> 28:43.596
Like I said, you're gonna enjoy
what is on that.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.060
And whatever you think about me...

28:52.313 --> 28:53.732
he's a good kid.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.483
A naive one...

28:56.359 --> 28:57.986
with his own Daddy issues.

28:59.654 --> 29:03.450
But that's how you like 'em.
Fatherless sons.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.076
Do your job.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.538
Get Jablonski off.

29:20.884 --> 29:25.180
Is it--
Is it true, in fact, Ms. Tonelli, that--

29:25.263 --> 29:27.098

29:27.182 --> 29:28.433

29:42.447 --> 29:45.492
-Give me a minute, I gotta change.
-We're gonna be late, giddyup.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.286
Put the yellow folders in my bag.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.996
-Please.
-Where are they?

29:50.371 --> 29:52.207
On the couch or somewhere.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.918
The city's gonna condemn this place.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.878
I'm telling you,
it looks like my Uncle Joe's,

29:56.961 --> 29:58.505
and that guy was a bona fide hoarder.

29:58.588 --> 30:01.925
-He used to use plastic bags as a toilet.
-[news report plays indistinctly]

30:02.008 --> 30:03.927

it's a slippery slope, KJ.

[Dolan] Bring the jury in.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.011
Everyone be seated.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.600
May counsel approach?

31:41.441 --> 31:45.069
Your Honor, we're all painfully aware
of the news cycle this morning.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.362
Your point, Counselor?

31:47.155 --> 31:51.075
Frankly, it makes these proceedings look
like an episode of the<i> Jersey Shore.</i>

31:51.451 --> 31:53.536
The State may benefit from new counsel.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.998
With all due respect, Your Honor,
that's not the court's decision to make.

31:57.081 --> 32:00.877
Agreed. Now, ladies,
can we get back to the point at hand?

32:00.960 --> 32:03.296
Yes? Good. Thank you.

32:03.379 --> 32:05.840
Ms. Harper, you may proceed.

32:08.134 --> 32:09.469
I know you did it.

32:09.552 --> 32:12.889
And what are you gonna do?
Throw a punch at me too? Go ahead.

32:15.767 --> 32:16.643

32:24.150 --> 32:26.527
The State calls Teresa Tonelli.

Raise your right hand.

32:51.094 --> 32:52.595
-It's the other hand, ma'am.
-Sorry.

32:52.679 --> 32:53.930
Left hand on the Bible.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.684
Swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

32:57.767 --> 32:58.851
so help you God?

32:59.394 --> 33:01.229
I do. Okay.

33:03.731 --> 33:04.774
[KJ] Ms. Tonelli,

33:05.400 --> 33:08.319
when you borrowed the blue Ford Escape

33:09.237 --> 33:11.447
on the morning of February 22nd,

33:12.865 --> 33:16.160
you had an altercation
with the defendant, correct?

33:16.244 --> 33:17.495
I don't remember.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.081
I just, um--

33:20.164 --> 33:21.541
Petey was upset, whatever.

33:21.624 --> 33:24.043
[KJ] Because you drove his car
seven days after the hit-and-run?

33:24.127 --> 33:25.920
No, 'cause Marie had been in the hospital.

33:26.629 --> 33:28.548
They lost their baby girl last year.

33:28.881 --> 33:30.550
She was stillborn.

33:30.633 --> 33:31.759
It was terrible.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.180
"You ever touch this truck again,

33:36.264 --> 33:38.933
and I swear to God,
I'll fucking kill you."

33:41.519 --> 33:44.022
Do you recall the defendant
saying those words to you?

33:44.397 --> 33:46.441
Can the clerk please mark the interview
with the neighbor,

33:46.524 --> 33:49.110
Mr. Howard Beggs, as State's Exhibit S-3.

33:50.611 --> 33:53.990
I'd like to direct your attention
to line ten, page five.

33:54.073 --> 33:56.784
And I remind you, you're under oath.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.164
Yeah, he said that.

34:02.457 --> 34:05.918
Whatever. He told me to get out
of the car. It wasn't a big deal.

34:06.002 --> 34:09.047
He grabbed you by the neck,
dragged you out of the car,

34:09.130 --> 34:10.298
and threw you against it.

34:10.381 --> 34:11.632
-Really?
-Objection.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.093
-Is that a question, Your Honor?
-It is. Sit down.

34:14.177 --> 34:17.138
I'll be the arbitrator of that,
not you, Ms. Harper.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.432
Your objection, Ms. Hennessy,
is overruled.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.228
Counselor.

34:27.356 --> 34:29.525
Are you afraid of the defendant,
Ms. Tonelli?

34:30.651 --> 34:31.861
No.

34:31.944 --> 34:33.988
Are you afraid he might hurt your cousin?

34:36.657 --> 34:37.909
He better not.

34:39.619 --> 34:42.663
[KJ] Yet he left a boy
out in the cold to die.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.166
A child, a black child--

34:45.249 --> 34:46.667
Objection, speculation.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.211
[Dolan] Sustained.

34:48.294 --> 34:50.129
Why did you go to Brenton Butler's vigil?

34:54.967 --> 34:56.761
He was just a kid.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.390
He shouldn't have died like that.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.310
[KJ] He could have lived.

35:04.393 --> 35:07.688
If one person spoke up. Just one.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.691
I know you're scared.

35:11.484 --> 35:13.402
And I know how easy it is

35:13.486 --> 35:16.489
to walk away and to say nothing,

35:17.323 --> 35:20.243
but you know the truth,
and you know right from wrong.

35:20.326 --> 35:21.494
Objection!

35:21.953 --> 35:23.830
Don't leave him out in the cold, Teresa,
please.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.249
[Sam] Objection!
Is there a question here, Your Honor?

35:26.791 --> 35:28.126
[Dolan] Ask the question, Counselor.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.628
-Where's the blue SUV?
-I don't know.

35:31.170 --> 35:33.881
[KJ] You do know, that's why you went
to the park, to the vigil.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.843
-I said I don't know where it is.
-This is outrageous, Your Honor.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.554
-Where's the missing grille guard?
-She's harassing her own witness.

35:39.637 --> 35:43.015
-Where is it, Teresa? Tell me.
-[Dolan] Counselors, approach now.

35:43.432 --> 35:45.726
[KJ] He was bleeding and screaming

35:45.810 --> 35:49.105
-and dying alone. A child.
-Objection! Your Honor, please.

35:49.188 --> 35:51.190
-Be that one person, Teresa...
-She is violating--

35:51.274 --> 35:52.942
...and tell me where
the missing grille guard is.

35:53.025 --> 35:54.318
It's not missing!

35:54.402 --> 35:56.487
[Teresa crying]

35:59.365 --> 36:00.992
It's in his backyard.

Teresa!

36:15.089 --> 36:16.174
How could you do that?

36:16.257 --> 36:17.383
Get Mikey. Go quick.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.719
-We can go now before it's too late.
-You're crazy!

36:19.802 --> 36:23.472
Me? How can you not see what they are?
They planted that thing in your pool.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.308
-They don't care about you.
-Fucking bitch!

36:25.391 --> 36:28.519
-You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
-[DiAngelo] Get off!

36:28.603 --> 36:29.770
You fucking bitch!

36:29.854 --> 36:31.439
You son of a bitch!

36:31.522 --> 36:32.440
The baby!

36:32.523 --> 36:34.442
[Teresa] There won't be a baby!

36:34.525 --> 36:37.945
You think I'm gonna bring your child
into this world? For what?

36:38.029 --> 36:39.906
What kind of father are you gonna be?

36:39.989 --> 36:42.325
You kill kids
and you're looking at me like that?

36:42.408 --> 36:44.744
-Yo, stop! Stop! Come on.
-Fuck you.

36:45.411 --> 36:49.165
Now we got something in common, Pete.
You and me.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.584
We're the same.

Hey, hey.
I didn't have nothing to do with this.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.270
I told them to get rid of it. Fuck.

37:11.354 --> 37:13.231
Babe, come on, let's go, let's go.

37:14.398 --> 37:15.900
You stupid fuck!

37:16.692 --> 37:19.237
Hey! I'm talking to you!
I'm fucking talking to you!

37:19.320 --> 37:20.863
Back the fuck off!

37:21.489 --> 37:23.824
No one is listening to you no more!

37:24.533 --> 37:27.161
You destroy everyone around you!

37:27.536 --> 37:29.372
Everything you fucking touch!

37:30.665 --> 37:32.166
Just look around you, man.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.085
Just look.

37:37.755 --> 37:39.507
Let's get the fuck out of here.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.813
[indistinct police radio chatter]

38:01.946 --> 38:03.322
-What is this?
-Mrs. Butler, Mr. Butler.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.408
What is this?
What does this mean for the case?

38:05.491 --> 38:06.701
It means we got him.

38:07.201 --> 38:10.663
And we can get the other three now too
by turning Jablonski against them.

38:10.746 --> 38:12.665
-In exchange for a plea.
-A plea?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.209
We won't agree.
He's got to pay for what he did.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.128
He'll still do time, I promise you that.

38:17.211 --> 38:19.839
-But we can get all of them with this.
-How much time?

38:20.715 --> 38:24.051
I have to be reasonable
or he won't agree to it. Eight years.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.053
[Latrice sighs]

38:26.137 --> 38:28.306
You make him get on that stand
and say what he did.

38:28.389 --> 38:29.223
Yeah.

38:30.099 --> 38:33.144
You're right. He's got to.
He's got to get up on that stand, KJ.

38:33.227 --> 38:35.896
I need to hear those words
come out of his mouth.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.065
-I want that whole courtroom to hear it.
-I understand.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.651
-I need to hear what happened to Brenton!
-He will. I understand.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.696
All right, baby. It's almost over.

38:43.779 --> 38:46.574
-I need to hear him say it.
-It's almost over.

[Sam]
<i>He'll give a written statement, that's it.</i>

39:05.593 --> 39:08.054
I won't have my hands tied
if this thing goes south.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.766
There's no deal if your client
doesn't testify in open court.

39:12.850 --> 39:17.313
Okay. I know your experience is limited,
so let me break this down for you.

39:17.855 --> 39:22.485
My client is guaranteed death by auto,
five to ten years,

39:22.568 --> 39:25.029
if the jury hears him confess
to the accident.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.365
Would you rather gamble with 30?

39:27.907 --> 39:29.617
That's if you can prove a hate crime.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.702
Which you've failed at miserably
up to now.

39:39.293 --> 39:41.796
Wait, we want a plea.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.923
-I ain't no rat.
-Petey.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.800
They put that thing in our pool.

39:47.009 --> 39:48.969
You don't have to be loyal to them.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.222
Mrs. Jablonski. Please.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.435
Five years max,

39:56.519 --> 39:57.895
you get your confession.

39:57.978 --> 39:59.730
My last offer.

40:00.564 --> 40:01.565
Eight years.

40:05.694 --> 40:07.071
Can we have a minute?

40:17.748 --> 40:20.668
Eight years for him
and 20 each for the other three.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.254
That's almost 70 years in total.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.174
Think a lifetime's long enough
for the Butlers?

40:27.258 --> 40:28.259
[Fish chuckles]

40:30.761 --> 40:32.847
Did you see the look on the jury's faces

40:32.930 --> 40:35.349
when she paraded around
those autopsy photos?

40:35.433 --> 40:38.394
-They don't like you very much right now.
-Fuck them.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.603
No. Fuck you.

40:40.062 --> 40:41.772
Fuck your wife, fuck your kid.

40:42.314 --> 40:44.859
He'll be 30 by the time
you get out of prison.

40:47.194 --> 40:51.949
I urge you to consider eight years
and a confession your best option.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.579
[protestors shouting indistinctly]

41:01.709 --> 41:03.043
[indistinct chatter]

41:04.879 --> 41:08.048
Hey, um, why don't you go inside?
I'll be there in a minute.

41:08.382 --> 41:09.508
Okay.

41:18.267 --> 41:19.268
[exhales]

41:32.781 --> 41:36.202
I'd kill you myself,
but then I'd be no better than you are.

41:38.662 --> 41:39.955
But know this...

41:41.916 --> 41:44.335
you <i>will</i> meet your God.

41:46.212 --> 41:48.380
On that you can depend.

41:50.758 --> 41:51.926
You making threats?

41:52.009 --> 41:53.594
No, no need for threats.

41:54.845 --> 41:58.557
Prison's the one place a white man
ain't no better than the rest of us.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.644
They gonna kill you in there.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.649
[chuckles]

42:07.274 --> 42:08.359
Oh, you don't know?

42:10.528 --> 42:12.196
Your boy's gonna give you up.

42:13.989 --> 42:15.449
He's gonna save himself.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.082
I see what you are.

42:26.669 --> 42:28.128
I know what you are.

42:30.130 --> 42:31.966
You ain't nothing but a coward.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.347
And the whole world's
gonna see it now, too.

42:59.868 --> 43:01.704
His diaper's soaked.
Just give me a minute.

43:01.787 --> 43:03.038
-We gotta go now.
-What?

43:03.122 --> 43:04.915
I'll get the bag. But let's go now.

43:04.999 --> 43:05.916
[baby coos]

43:20.347 --> 43:21.599
[elevator dings]

43:25.811 --> 43:27.438
I need to change Mikey.

43:30.816 --> 43:32.109
-I'll wait out here.
-I'm fine.

43:32.192 --> 43:34.945
Just-- I'll meet you inside.
Hennessy might need to talk to you.

43:35.904 --> 43:37.656
It's gonna be okay, babe.

43:38.407 --> 43:41.702
I'm proud of you for doing this.
You're doing this for us.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.121
-Okay?
-Yeah.

43:45.789 --> 43:46.624
I love you.

43:46.707 --> 43:48.125
[baby cries]

43:57.259 --> 43:58.761
I know what you're gonna do.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.143
Do it.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.482
Do it for your family, your son.

44:13.734 --> 44:14.652
I understand.

44:21.950 --> 44:23.035
It was me.

44:25.579 --> 44:28.082
I made you drive away.

44:31.710 --> 44:33.003
So you go in there,

44:34.588 --> 44:36.006
and you tell them the truth.

44:39.635 --> 44:40.678
Go on.

44:42.054 --> 44:43.097
Go.

45:16.171 --> 45:17.339
Mrs. Butler.

45:19.258 --> 45:20.467
I'm so...

45:21.844 --> 45:23.720
so sorry for your loss.

45:26.223 --> 45:27.307
I can't...

45:29.059 --> 45:34.273
I can't imagine what you're going through,
and I can't imagine losing my child.

45:35.232 --> 45:36.316
I know...

45:37.276 --> 45:41.113
there's nothing I can do
to make it up to you. I know that.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.825
But it was an accident.

45:47.911 --> 45:50.247
My husband is a good man.

45:52.082 --> 45:55.127
Your husband drove away from my child.

45:56.503 --> 45:58.672
How could you sit in that courtroom

45:59.131 --> 46:01.592
knowing what you know
and say those words to me?

46:01.675 --> 46:02.801
He didn't know.

46:02.885 --> 46:05.721
He would've never done that if he knew.

46:06.346 --> 46:07.264
He wouldn't.

46:07.347 --> 46:10.517
There's a whole lot he doesn't know,
that you don't know.

46:12.644 --> 46:14.563
That man you sit next to...

46:15.689 --> 46:16.690
in court...

46:17.983 --> 46:19.067
every day?

46:19.693 --> 46:21.445
The one you let hold your baby?

46:22.696 --> 46:24.364
He wanted your husband dead.

46:45.802 --> 46:47.221
[inaudible]

47:08.534 --> 47:09.660
[deputy] All rise.

47:11.828 --> 47:13.914
The honorable
Judge Robert Dolan presiding.

47:21.547 --> 47:24.341
[KJ] <i>Can you state your name and rank</i>
<i>for the record?</i>

47:24.424 --> 47:28.053
Officer Peter Michael Jablonski,
Jersey City Police Department.

47:28.470 --> 47:31.181
You transferred from the East District
to the South.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.559
What was the reason for this transfer?

47:33.642 --> 47:37.604
I joined the Anti-Gang and Narcotics Unit,
which is based out of the South.

47:38.146 --> 47:41.024
Your ranking officer
is Sergeant Michael DiAngelo.

47:41.608 --> 47:44.695
And you're expected to obey his orders,
is that true?

47:46.863 --> 47:48.156
[Pete] That's correct.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.701
[KJ] Directing your attention
to the morning of February 15th,

47:51.618 --> 47:55.122
can you recount the events
that transpired in Liberty Park?

47:56.456 --> 47:58.875
I'd just gotten a call
from my wife's cousin.

47:59.876 --> 48:02.212
Said Marie, my wife,

48:02.296 --> 48:03.547
was in the hospital.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.635
I was driving, on the phone,

48:09.303 --> 48:10.637
not paying attention...

48:12.055 --> 48:14.182
and I, uh-- I hit something.

48:14.891 --> 48:15.934
Something?

48:18.812 --> 48:21.148
What did you hit, Mr. Jablonski?

48:22.190 --> 48:23.358
I didn't see.

48:24.943 --> 48:28.071
And when I got out of my car,
I saw the grille guard hanging off.

48:29.364 --> 48:30.240
And...

48:31.325 --> 48:33.660
that bike underneath my wheels.

48:37.164 --> 48:41.209
Is it true that officers found
that grille guard in your backyard

48:41.293 --> 48:43.462
after executing a search warrant
last night?

48:48.967 --> 48:49.968
Yes.

48:50.969 --> 48:52.012
And this bike...

48:53.472 --> 48:55.390
is it present in the courtroom today?

48:56.266 --> 48:58.435
Yes. At the evidence table.

49:00.103 --> 49:03.690
So you were fully aware
that you hit a human being?

49:04.775 --> 49:05.859
Not an animal,

49:06.360 --> 49:07.444
not a tree.

49:08.695 --> 49:09.863
Maybe a black teenager?

49:09.946 --> 49:11.990
Objection, conjecture.

49:12.074 --> 49:13.909
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

49:20.791 --> 49:23.126
Are narcotics officers like yourself

49:23.210 --> 49:27.381
aware that this particular brand of bike,
the Sarongo Series,

49:27.464 --> 49:31.468
is used by members of the Five Kings,
a black gang in Jersey City?

49:33.720 --> 49:36.348
Yeah, but I didn't look too close at it.

49:36.431 --> 49:38.725
So it would be a reasonable assumption

49:38.809 --> 49:42.396
that whoever had been riding this bike
could've been black?

49:45.899 --> 49:47.484
I wasn't thinking about the bike.

49:47.567 --> 49:50.028
Your Honor, the State agreed
that questioning

49:50.112 --> 49:53.740
would be limited to the actual events
of February 15th.

49:54.074 --> 49:56.326
Ms. Harper, you are aware of this.

49:58.453 --> 50:01.665
What happened next,
after you exited your vehicle?

50:03.792 --> 50:06.211
I stood there on the road
next to my car...

50:07.587 --> 50:09.256
looking at the statue.

50:09.548 --> 50:11.007
The Statue of Liberty.

50:12.384 --> 50:15.470
I could see her, even her torch,
it was lit up.

50:15.554 --> 50:17.973
How long did you stand there,
on the road?

50:18.056 --> 50:19.850
-I don't know.
-Was it a few minutes?

50:19.933 --> 50:21.476
-A few seconds?
-I don't know.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.562
Did you go to the ditch
to see who was down there?

50:23.937 --> 50:26.148
I told you, I stood on the road
looking at the statue.

50:26.231 --> 50:29.234
There was blood everywhere
and you didn't think to go and look?

50:29.317 --> 50:31.236
-[Sam] Your Honor--
-I was thinking about the statue

50:31.319 --> 50:34.281
and this time when I climbed the stairs
inside her torch...

50:35.073 --> 50:36.783
when I was eight or nine.

50:38.034 --> 50:40.704
My mother was standing on the stairs
in front of me.

50:41.663 --> 50:44.166
And I could see the bruises
on the back of her legs.

50:44.875 --> 50:47.627
-That's what I was thinking about.
-[KJ] Mr. Jablonski.

50:49.629 --> 50:51.089
That's why I became a cop.

50:51.590 --> 50:53.592
Because of animals like my father.

50:53.675 --> 50:56.678
-I was never gonna be a coward like him.
-Mr. Jablonski.

50:57.345 --> 50:58.972
What did you do next?

51:03.769 --> 51:05.228
Mr. Jablonski.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.158
I drove away.

51:18.909 --> 51:20.243
[indistinct murmuring]

51:26.166 --> 51:28.168
Let me remind you that you're under oath.

51:28.251 --> 51:30.295
Your Honor,
the question's been asked and answered.

51:30.378 --> 51:32.589
-What did you do next?
-I said I drove away.

51:32.672 --> 51:35.425
-That's not what you did and you know it.
-[Dolan] Counselor, approach now.

51:35.509 --> 51:37.969
-What did you do after you exited?
-Ms. Harper, that is enough!

51:38.053 --> 51:40.430
-Say it. Say what you did.
-[Sam] Your Honor, please.

51:40.514 --> 51:41.890
Say what you did, goddamn it!

51:41.973 --> 51:43.433
[Dolan]
Remove Ms. Harper from my courtroom.

51:43.517 --> 51:44.976
Say what you did.
Say what you did--

51:45.060 --> 51:46.186
-Let's go.
-Don't touch me!

51:46.269 --> 51:47.187
Say what you did!

51:47.270 --> 51:50.357
-[Dolan] Arrest her for contempt of court.
-Look at them and say what you did.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.526
-Get off. Get off of me.
-Stop resisting.

51:52.609 --> 51:53.693
You're an asshole.

51:54.277 --> 51:55.278
Stop resisting.

51:55.362 --> 51:56.613
Take it easy.

51:57.447 --> 51:58.865
[KJ] Get the fuck off me!

51:58.949 --> 52:01.201
[crowd murmuring]

52:21.638 --> 52:22.722
[door opens]

52:22.806 --> 52:24.641
[keys jingling]

52:32.274 --> 52:33.984
We gotta stop meeting like this.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.861
[door lock buzzes nearby]

52:37.153 --> 52:39.614
Dolan wants to move forward,
<i>no bueno</i> on the mistrial.

52:39.698 --> 52:41.950
And he's gonna let you do
your closing tomorrow.

52:42.033 --> 52:43.451
Fair guy.

52:43.535 --> 52:46.788
Connelly, on the other hand,
wants your resignation after.

52:46.872 --> 52:50.083
-And he sent you to deliver the message.
-No, he told the press that.

52:51.376 --> 52:52.544
Of course he did.

52:55.171 --> 52:56.715
"Sit in the box,

52:57.924 --> 53:01.678
and see what the jury sees."
It's Trial Prep 101.

53:04.681 --> 53:06.266
Today they saw

53:06.766 --> 53:08.518
a broken-hearted little boy

53:08.935 --> 53:10.854
gazing up at the Statue of Liberty.

53:11.730 --> 53:13.023
Fucking great.

53:15.400 --> 53:16.943
They don't get to see Brenton.

53:17.027 --> 53:19.237
-He doesn't get to take the stand.
-Make them see him.

53:19.321 --> 53:21.323
I did, no one cares!

53:22.073 --> 53:24.951
I told you, no one puts cops away.

53:25.368 --> 53:28.747
I wasn't ever gonna win this.
It was always about optics for Connelly,

53:28.830 --> 53:30.957
a black face for the black vote.

53:31.499 --> 53:33.627
It's the greatest show on earth,
this shit.

53:36.588 --> 53:38.048
-Wanna know something else?
-Hmm?

53:38.131 --> 53:39.716
-I'm a second-rate lawyer.
-Mmm.

53:39.799 --> 53:42.218
I can't win. I won't win. So...

53:42.928 --> 53:44.012
just go.

53:44.095 --> 53:45.889
-That might be true.
-It is fucking true.

53:45.972 --> 53:48.308
Okay, then it is. You suck. Now get up.

53:49.893 --> 53:54.022
You got a dead kid to speak for.
You got two dead kids... to speak for.

53:54.481 --> 53:56.942
-You're all that they've got left.
-It's over, Fish.

53:58.985 --> 54:00.153
Tell that to him.

54:01.821 --> 54:02.739
Not me.

54:03.365 --> 54:04.491
You wanna quit?

54:06.493 --> 54:07.619
But tell Brenton that.

54:10.413 --> 54:11.748
I'm sick of hearing it.

54:12.332 --> 54:14.834
-[KJ sighs]
-[Fish knocks]

54:31.768 --> 54:35.814
[woman over PA]<i> This is your last call</i>

54:35.897 --> 54:37.899
[announcement continues indistinctly]

54:45.365 --> 54:48.034
Mr. Butler told me you were leaving,
so I...

54:49.452 --> 54:50.704
Can I sit down?

54:52.288 --> 54:54.207
I'd like to ask you something.

54:56.251 --> 54:58.628
You were the last person that Brenton saw.

54:59.754 --> 55:03.383
-The last person he talked to--
-What do you want from me, Mrs. Butler?

55:05.135 --> 55:08.013
Anything. Just anything. I just...

55:08.555 --> 55:12.142
want to know what he...
what he said, what he was thinking.

55:16.730 --> 55:20.567
I woke up that morning.
Brenton was next to me.

55:21.484 --> 55:22.569
That's all.

55:26.239 --> 55:27.782
Was he happy?

55:35.331 --> 55:36.458
He was home.

55:40.670 --> 55:42.172
He sprayed that stuff...

55:44.049 --> 55:45.091
that cologne...

55:47.343 --> 55:48.803
before he left.

55:50.847 --> 55:52.098
He liked that stuff.

55:54.809 --> 55:56.686
My room still smelled like it.

56:00.523 --> 56:01.524
At night...

56:03.943 --> 56:06.696
he used to listen to the cars
pass on the bridge.

56:09.324 --> 56:11.284
Brenton said it sounded like the ocean.

56:14.037 --> 56:17.040
[woman over PA]<i> Mobile, Alabama bus</i>

56:33.431 --> 56:34.474
You know?

56:39.395 --> 56:41.231
Oh, sweetheart.

57:15.849 --> 57:16.683
[door closes]

57:27.694 --> 57:29.028
Thought you were gone.

57:30.947 --> 57:33.867
I was... I...

57:34.534 --> 57:35.994
You need a place to stay?

57:39.539 --> 57:40.457
Nah.

57:42.876 --> 57:44.711
I gotta find my own way.

57:47.464 --> 57:49.424
There's something out there, I just...

57:51.968 --> 57:53.678
I just gotta find it. You feel me?

57:59.601 --> 58:00.643
[Isaiah chuckles]

58:01.311 --> 58:03.229
It's too big for one person.

58:05.648 --> 58:07.317
And Tricey ain't coming back.

58:09.152 --> 58:10.111
[Isaiah chuckles]

58:11.905 --> 58:12.989
I don't blame her.

58:15.825 --> 58:17.118
Drove y'all away.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.331
My wife, my son,

58:21.831 --> 58:22.916
you.

58:26.002 --> 58:27.837
I could've done what she said.

58:28.922 --> 58:30.256
I could've just said it.

58:34.385 --> 58:35.595
At the hospital...

58:37.388 --> 58:39.432
she said, "Tell Brenton you love him."

58:44.270 --> 58:45.438
Now he'll never know.

58:48.733 --> 58:50.985
My son died not knowing I did.

58:55.073 --> 58:56.491
That day at the ocean...

59:01.371 --> 59:03.039
Yeah.

59:05.291 --> 59:06.292
You remember that day?

59:07.252 --> 59:08.336
You remember that?

59:12.382 --> 59:13.800
Isaiah, you gotta remember.

59:15.260 --> 59:16.261
You were there.

59:18.805 --> 59:21.266
I was working so much
back when he was small.

59:22.809 --> 59:25.520
And Tricey got sick,
there was so much to tend to.

59:26.729 --> 59:27.730
[exhales]

59:29.482 --> 59:30.692
Why you bring this up?

59:30.775 --> 59:33.319
Why you think Brenton
loved them seagulls so much?

59:36.781 --> 59:38.700
Because his father brought him there.

59:40.368 --> 59:41.953
Isaiah, you took that picture.

59:46.583 --> 59:49.752
Showed him the best day of his life.

59:52.755 --> 59:53.923
That's what he said.

59:56.759 --> 59:58.678
You ain't gotta say the words, 'Saiah.

1:00:00.179 --> 1:00:01.139
He knew.

1:00:04.475 --> 1:00:05.602
Your son...

1:00:07.437 --> 1:00:08.521
knew...

1:00:09.147 --> 1:00:10.356
that you loved him.

1:00:22.952 --> 1:00:24.704
I'm sorry for driving you off...

1:00:26.789 --> 1:00:27.999
for what I did.

1:00:32.170 --> 1:00:33.254
I'm sorry.

1:00:35.381 --> 1:00:37.050
You ain't gotta apologize, bro.

1:00:49.145 --> 1:00:50.229
[exhales]

1:00:51.564 --> 1:00:52.774
I gotta go.

1:00:53.399 --> 1:00:54.484
Yeah. I gotta...

1:00:54.567 --> 1:00:56.402
Yeah. All right.

1:00:57.820 --> 1:00:59.030
[Isaiah] You'll find it.

1:01:01.574 --> 1:01:02.784
What you're looking for.

1:01:07.830 --> 1:01:09.999
And when you do, hang on.

1:01:29.435 --> 1:01:30.978
[birds squawking]

1:01:45.618 --> 1:01:47.620
[birds squawking]

1:03:23.591 --> 1:03:25.051
[Judge Dolan clears throat]

1:03:26.969 --> 1:03:28.679
[Dolan] Ms. Harper, you may begin.

1:03:48.074 --> 1:03:50.034
I went to the park this morning,

1:03:52.161 --> 1:03:54.872
to the place where
Brenton Butler lay dying.

1:03:58.459 --> 1:04:00.086
I wanted to imagine...

1:04:00.962 --> 1:04:02.088
what he felt...

1:04:03.589 --> 1:04:06.175
as he watched the first light
of the morning come,

1:04:07.051 --> 1:04:09.470
and the last light of day fade away.

1:04:11.597 --> 1:04:12.807
As he lay there,

1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:15.351
in that ditch...

1:04:16.686 --> 1:04:18.104
for 12 hours...

1:04:20.189 --> 1:04:21.148
wondering what?

1:04:22.817 --> 1:04:23.943
For his mother,

1:04:25.027 --> 1:04:26.195
and for his father,

1:04:27.488 --> 1:04:31.033
it is a terrible thing to have to imagine,

1:04:32.243 --> 1:04:33.578
and not even know,

1:04:34.328 --> 1:04:35.538
but imagine,

1:04:35.913 --> 1:04:37.832
your child's last seconds.

1:04:40.376 --> 1:04:41.878
"Did he cry out for me?

1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:47.967
Did he wonder why I didn't come?
Why no one did?"

1:04:50.219 --> 1:04:51.554
This is what we know:

1:04:52.013 --> 1:04:54.599
The defendant's blue Ford Escape

1:04:54.682 --> 1:04:58.227
collided with the victim's bike
on an icy road

1:04:58.311 --> 1:05:00.354
on the morning of February 15th.

1:05:01.314 --> 1:05:04.233
The grille guard
from Peter Jablonski's car,

1:05:04.317 --> 1:05:07.778
in addition to his own testimony,
are proof of this.

1:05:08.613 --> 1:05:12.950
Ladies and gentlemen, the State submits
you have no other choice

1:05:13.034 --> 1:05:17.496
but to find the defendant guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt

1:05:17.580 --> 1:05:18.831
of death by auto.

1:05:23.419 --> 1:05:25.338
Peter Jablonski testified...

1:05:26.964 --> 1:05:28.716
that after hitting Brenton Butler

1:05:29.592 --> 1:05:31.260
and exiting his vehicle,

1:05:32.219 --> 1:05:36.933
all he saw as he stood on the road
next to his car

1:05:37.016 --> 1:05:38.434
was the Statue of Liberty.

1:05:39.060 --> 1:05:43.356
I want you to remember how he described
that her torch was lit up

1:05:43.439 --> 1:05:45.274
like a beacon in the sun.

1:05:45.691 --> 1:05:48.819
And now I want you to think
about the crime scene photos

1:05:48.903 --> 1:05:52.031
that I've shown you
over the course of this trial.

1:05:54.325 --> 1:05:55.534
This morning...

1:05:56.619 --> 1:05:58.204
I too stood on that road,

1:05:59.038 --> 1:06:02.917
in the exact same spot
the defendant stood.

1:06:03.626 --> 1:06:04.669
Right here.

1:06:06.337 --> 1:06:09.840
It's impossible to see
the Statue of Liberty from the road.

1:06:09.924 --> 1:06:11.759
It is completely blocked.

1:06:11.842 --> 1:06:13.177
This...

1:06:13.469 --> 1:06:15.805
is the view from the edge of the ditch.

1:06:15.888 --> 1:06:16.847
[indistinct murmuring]

1:06:16.931 --> 1:06:20.851
So Peter Jablonski can only have seen
the Statue of Liberty

1:06:20.935 --> 1:06:25.856
if he stood at the edge of the ditch,
which means he saw Brenton Butler.

1:06:25.940 --> 1:06:27.108
[indistinct murmuring]

1:06:30.903 --> 1:06:34.198
How long did he stand there?

1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:37.576
How many seconds...

1:06:38.285 --> 1:06:41.247
did he look down at Brenton?

1:06:42.123 --> 1:06:43.249
One second?

1:06:44.458 --> 1:06:45.626
Two seconds?

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:48.963
<i>Three?</i>

1:06:52.675 --> 1:06:53.843
<i>Four?</i>

1:06:55.011 --> 1:06:56.137
Five?

1:06:58.764 --> 1:07:00.016
<i>Six seconds?</i>

1:07:02.143 --> 1:07:03.436
<i>Seven seconds?</i>

1:07:08.774 --> 1:07:10.651
Peter Jablonski walked away.

1:07:13.446 --> 1:07:14.947
And Brenton Butler died.

1:07:17.199 --> 1:07:18.784
When he could have lived.

1:07:21.328 --> 1:07:24.290
Would he have walked away
if Brenton were white?

1:07:27.043 --> 1:07:28.044
Would you?

1:07:30.629 --> 1:07:35.301
You must also consider this a hate crime,
because there is a bigger crime,

1:07:36.552 --> 1:07:38.679
a bigger problem.

1:07:38.763 --> 1:07:40.347
We have a problem,

1:07:40.848 --> 1:07:43.434
and our country has a problem.

1:07:43.893 --> 1:07:45.394
Our children are dying,

1:07:45.478 --> 1:07:46.854
in plain sight,

1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:50.274
left like roadkill on our playgrounds,

1:07:50.357 --> 1:07:52.151
our streets, and our sidewalks.

1:07:52.568 --> 1:07:53.819
Turn on the news.

1:07:55.071 --> 1:07:56.280
Open a paper.

1:07:57.281 --> 1:07:59.116
And read their names.

1:07:59.617 --> 1:08:04.789
Each is a clear message
to every black woman, man, and child

1:08:04.872 --> 1:08:08.667
that our lives and our bodies
have no value.

1:08:08.751 --> 1:08:11.087
So how many names are enough,

1:08:12.088 --> 1:08:14.715
before we, before you say,

1:08:15.716 --> 1:08:16.717
"Enough"?

1:08:21.180 --> 1:08:24.809
The defendant said
that he never saw Brenton Butler.

1:08:25.768 --> 1:08:28.813
I'd like you to see Brenton now.

1:08:29.772 --> 1:08:32.608
And not how he died,

1:08:34.318 --> 1:08:35.569
but how he lived.

1:08:36.278 --> 1:08:39.532
See those seconds near that icy road.

1:08:41.951 --> 1:08:45.454
<i>Before a car met a boy on a bike.</i>

1:08:47.331 --> 1:08:52.044
<i>See the sky above and the earth below.</i>

1:08:53.337 --> 1:08:56.090
<i>And in these last seconds of a life,</i>

1:08:57.258 --> 1:08:58.801
<i>see how beautiful it is,</i>

1:09:00.094 --> 1:09:04.140
<i>how endless and precious his life is.</i>

1:09:06.350 --> 1:09:07.560
<i>Do you see him?</i>

1:09:09.854 --> 1:09:11.272
Then let Brenton know...

1:09:15.484 --> 1:09:16.694
his life mattered.

1:10:00.905 --> 1:10:04.867

of your great earth.

-See us today, Father God.
-See us.

On the charge of death by auto,

Today, justice was served.

We were given proof
that no one is above the law.

And everyone, including the police,
