00:01.000 --> 00:03.492
<i>Previously on Kyle XY:</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:06.700
Seven, eight, one, two, two, seven.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.103
What does it mean?

00:08.173 --> 00:10.267
Kyle may be
connected to a murder.

00:10.343 --> 00:14.370
<i>Police have identified
the remains as William Kern,</i>

00:14.447 --> 00:17.473
<i>a professor
at the University of Washington.</i>

00:17.550 --> 00:19.882
If I knew Kern
and that's where he taught,

00:19.953 --> 00:21.818
someone there might know who I am.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.378
What is it?

00:23.456 --> 00:26.823
This grad student looks
exactly like Kyle,

00:26.893 --> 00:28.758
except he's missing since the '80s.

00:28.828 --> 00:32.195
I found out his name.
The guy in the photo. It's Adam Baylin.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.664
The guy drew the symbol
Kyle kept drawing,

00:34.734 --> 00:36.292
with this code next to it.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.928
Kyle figured out
it's latitude and longitude.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.371
It's a spot in the woods right by here.

00:41.441 --> 00:46.811
Everything I did was to protect you.
Stop asking questions. Forget the past.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.747
Because if you don't,
they'll kill you, Kyle.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.909
They'll kill all of you.

00:54.354 --> 00:59.053
Seven, eight, one, two, two, seven.
He's alive.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.233
I'm looking at a ghost, Mr. Reynolds.

01:16.309 --> 01:21.076
781227 was scheduled
for termination two months ago.

01:21.147 --> 01:24.480
- How is it possible he survived?
- I'm still looking into it.

01:24.551 --> 01:28.078
How did he leave here?
How has he functioned all this time?

01:28.154 --> 01:29.781
I'll get you the answers.

01:29.856 --> 01:33.019
This is an inexcusable breach.

01:33.093 --> 01:37.120
This company cannot afford to have
that subject loose in the outside world.

01:38.631 --> 01:39.996
You must find him.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.678
The babe count is lame here today.

01:55.748 --> 01:58.376
Wait until the Beachwood Carnival
this weekend.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.419
Tons of ladies there.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.648
Major opportunity to score.

02:02.755 --> 02:04.723
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

02:05.925 --> 02:08.086
She wants me.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.925
Dude, she was totally
throwing me the vibe.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.024
If you say so.

02:15.668 --> 02:19.001
Don't let Charlie pressure you.
Wait until you're sure.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.302
How do I know I'm sure?

02:21.374 --> 02:22.739
You don't.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.302
So either dive in or let the guy go.

02:26.913 --> 02:30.474
Don't make a blanket statement.
Each situation is different.

02:30.583 --> 02:34.542
- Yeah, but every guy is the same.
- No, Charlie's different.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.951
He's special.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.852
Haven't you ever
found anyone special?

02:41.928 --> 02:43.862
Not for more than five minutes.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.865
Actually, I have found someone.

02:46.933 --> 02:49.163
Oh, really? Who?

02:51.337 --> 02:53.396
I think she's talking about me.

02:54.941 --> 03:00.004
"Lick the... paper... walnut. "

03:00.079 --> 03:03.173
- What are you doing?
- Reading her lips.

03:08.955 --> 03:10.718
"This is different.

03:12.425 --> 03:15.724
He's different. Which is why
I'm not going to talk about it. "

03:20.800 --> 03:24.827
"I'm your best friend. I can't believe
you won't tell me who it is. "

03:24.904 --> 03:28.169
- Did she just say that?
- I don't think she's talking about you.

03:28.241 --> 03:32.007
Oh, she totally is. Come on.
You just said that she said...

03:32.078 --> 03:34.808
"The first time we kissed,

03:34.881 --> 03:38.647
God, it gets me hot
just to think about it. "

03:39.419 --> 03:42.252
He giveth and he taketh away.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.251
Well, it's her loss anyways.

03:46.359 --> 03:50.693
Now you're a master lip reader.
Is there anything you can't do?

03:52.432 --> 03:53.922
If we don't locate him soon,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.060
his abilities will draw attention,
invite questions.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.696
- We can't let that happen.
- I'll take care of it.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.831
That may be difficult.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.206
Apparently, he has a protector.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.507
Yes, we're still trying to identify him.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.946
Do that.
Then remove him.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.546
And the boy?

04:18.725 --> 04:21.887
Do what should've been done months ago.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.009
<i>Watch him,
but don't get too close.</i>

04:42.081 --> 04:46.017
<i>The company will make the connection
soon, and send someone to trail you.</i>

04:46.085 --> 04:47.780
I know how they work.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.580
I'll be ready.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.056
<i>Has he been asking any more questions?</i>

04:55.194 --> 04:57.094
I told him to keep quiet.

04:58.064 --> 05:00.328
So far he has.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.231
<i>Tom Foss had warned me
to stop digging into my past.</i>

05:07.307 --> 05:09.605
<i>But how could I surrender my search?</i>

05:09.676 --> 05:13.305
<i>How could I leave all of my questions
behind and simply move on?</i>

05:14.681 --> 05:17.616
<i>Still, I couldn't
put the family at risk.</i>

05:17.684 --> 05:18.912
Hey.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.319
Kyle, I haven't wanted to push you,

05:24.390 --> 05:27.291
but with everything that happened
at the university,

05:27.360 --> 05:30.193
- it's time we talked.
- I don't need a therapy session.

05:30.963 --> 05:34.865
You saw a 20-year-old photograph
of a man who looks just like you.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.630
A man who drew the same symbol
you've been drawing.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.331
That's all in the past.

05:39.405 --> 05:41.566
I want to focus on the present now.

05:41.674 --> 05:45.838
We need to figure out your past
in order for your present to make sense.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.745
Why? What's done is done.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.479
It's time to move on.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.020
How's it going?

06:06.466 --> 06:09.196
- It's going good.
- Yeah?

06:13.906 --> 06:17.740
- Forget about what happened.
- Forget it? Right.

06:18.878 --> 06:23.178
You don't know Tom Foss, but he tells
you to stop investigating your own life,

06:23.249 --> 06:25.615
- and you're gonna listen to him?
- If I don't,

06:25.685 --> 06:29.348
and he finds out I'm still asking
questions, the Tragers could get hurt.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.982
He doesn't have to know about it.

06:32.992 --> 06:36.860
- Am I interrupting something?
- No, not at all.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.334
- I don't like that guy.
- Who?

06:50.443 --> 06:52.502
- Dexter.
- Declan.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.738
Whatever.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.645
- I don't want Lori seeing him.
- Well, good luck with that.

06:57.717 --> 07:01.744
- He's trouble.
- I think he's got some potential.

07:01.821 --> 07:04.517
A hit-and-run driver
that deflowered our daughter.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.251
He's lucky I let him in the house.

07:11.063 --> 07:15.966
- Holding up the door?
- Shh. I can't hear what they're saying.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.730
Why don't you just ask them
what they're talking about?

07:20.473 --> 07:22.498
Because they're talking about me.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.569
My midterm grades were mailed out.

07:26.646 --> 07:30.343
I need advance warning if I tanked,
so I can start spin control.

07:33.186 --> 07:36.952
Hey, you don't have X-ray vision,
by any chance,

07:37.023 --> 07:39.787
to read their lips through the door?

07:39.859 --> 07:41.622
How about X-ray hearing?

07:51.604 --> 07:54.539
- I won't stand for it anymore.
- Crap. Who said that?

07:54.607 --> 07:55.733
Your dad.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.777
Wait, you can really hear what he says
through the door?

07:58.845 --> 08:01.814
- But I'm not going to listen.
- Hang on.

08:01.914 --> 08:05.611
Talk about potential, buddy.
This could be huge.

08:12.725 --> 08:16.217
Tom Foss.
He was assigned to 781227.

08:16.295 --> 08:19.856
- What do you know of him?
- He was with us for ten years.

08:19.932 --> 08:22.662
As a matter of fact,
he had a hand in training me.

08:25.705 --> 08:29.801
He's quiet, intense.
Never had a problem with his assignment,

08:29.876 --> 08:32.777
not until the subject
was scheduled for termination.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.211
Yes, I see he resigned shortly after.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.772
William Kern went missing
around that time.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.013
Oh, and Dennis Bunker,
who processed Foss's resignation?

08:41.120 --> 08:44.954
- He disappeared too.
- Foss has been covering his tracks.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.390
Oh, I'm sure he's expecting our visit.

08:48.394 --> 08:50.760
He won't go anywhere near the boy now.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.229
- Does he have family?
- No.

08:53.933 --> 08:57.300
His wife and daughter died
in a car accident a few years back.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.567
Follow him for now.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.301
See what you find.

09:04.143 --> 09:07.112
If you could hear through the door,
if you concentrate,

09:07.179 --> 09:09.909
maybe you could hear
what people say from far away.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.916
Why would I want to do that?

09:12.451 --> 09:14.783
God, that brain is just wasted on you.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.345
Humor me.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.956
OK. But what do I do?

09:21.594 --> 09:23.892
You're the genius.
Figure it out.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.660
Focus or something.

09:36.475 --> 09:39.171
Over there, with the dog.
What are they saying?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.557
<i>I tried to ignore
my other senses,</i>

09:51.624 --> 09:53.956
<i>devoting all of my attention to hearing.</i>

09:56.329 --> 10:00.163
<i>And slowly, I could filter out
the unnecessary noise.</i>

10:01.834 --> 10:03.927
How often does she visit?

10:04.003 --> 10:07.564
The woman hovers. She flits
around, making helpful suggestions.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.404
It's for a few more days.
And then she's back to Florida.

10:10.476 --> 10:13.240
She'd better, or I'll
strap your mother on that plane.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.872
It's not like your parents
are perfect, either.

10:15.948 --> 10:19.611
At least they don't get in the way.
It's just like I want to tell you...

10:19.685 --> 10:21.152
Can you hear anything?

10:26.325 --> 10:28.589
<i>- I saw a flash of light.
- What's wrong?</i>

10:29.395 --> 10:32.364
<i>Like a strange electrical charge
in my head.</i>

10:32.999 --> 10:36.298
<i>It was as if my body were warning me
not to continue.</i>

10:39.171 --> 10:42.663
<i>Declan told me to look into my past
without Tom Foss knowing.</i>

10:42.742 --> 10:47.111
<i>I knew I'd just found a way.
But I couldn't let on to anyone else.</i>

10:47.213 --> 10:48.976
Kyle, could you hear anything?

10:49.615 --> 10:52.709
No. Not a sound.

11:04.864 --> 11:07.833
Yeah, thanks so much, Lou. Bye.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.868
Lou Daniels?

11:09.969 --> 11:13.405
Yeah, I was checking a reference
on a therapist for Kyle.

11:13.472 --> 11:15.565
Why does he need a second therapist?

11:15.641 --> 11:18.735
Actually, I don't think
I should be treating him at all.

11:19.311 --> 11:21.472
I've been working with him for months.

11:21.547 --> 11:25.779
He can't remember anything
beyond flashes, which I can't explain.

11:25.851 --> 11:29.719
And then yesterday, he insisted
he's ready to put the past behind him.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.950
Well, maybe that's the best thing.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.460
Stephen, he's been struggling
for so long to remember.

11:35.528 --> 11:39.089
He can't be done, just like that.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.361
He's regressing and I can't
get through to him.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.436
Give it some more time.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.768
But he won't talk to me,
not as his therapist.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.109
You've never given up
on a patient before.

11:51.177 --> 11:55.739
Kyle's become more than a patient to me,
and that's the problem.

11:56.682 --> 11:58.547
I'm afraid I can't be objective,

11:59.552 --> 12:01.884
and it's getting in the way
of his progress.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.760
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hey.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.303
- How's the game?
- Oh, I don't know.

12:19.371 --> 12:21.498
I've been studying for my confirmation.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.634
- What are you confirming?
- My faith.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.113
My mom really wants me to do it,
and I was all set to go last year,

12:30.182 --> 12:33.345
but after my dad died...

12:34.453 --> 12:37.616
Well, I wasn't really into
the whole religion thing.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.854
But I'm doing it now.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.292
I'd really love you
to come to the ceremony.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.193
Sure your mom will be OK with that?

12:45.264 --> 12:47.789
She doesn't get to decide
everything for me.

12:47.867 --> 12:51.428
Besides, you're my friend.
I want you to be there.

12:53.472 --> 12:54.803
Hey, babe.

12:54.874 --> 12:58.002
- Oh, gross! You're all sweaty.
- Oh, you know you love it.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.109
Whatever.

13:00.179 --> 13:03.080
Well, I got to run.
Our church's bishop is coming by.

13:03.149 --> 13:04.639
Sounds like a blast.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.785
- Bye, guys.
- I'm out of here too.

13:11.157 --> 13:14.524
Forget about her, man.
Plenty more where that came from.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.595
It's not Amanda.

13:16.662 --> 13:18.630
I need your help.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.838
- Bye, Dad.
- Where you off to?

13:30.075 --> 13:33.135
Just going to hang with Declan
before the carnival.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.611
Declan.

13:35.681 --> 13:38.309
You say his name with such enthusiasm.

13:40.886 --> 13:43.582
- What do you see in that guy?
- Dad.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.422
You could find somebody honorable
who hasn't committed a felony.

13:47.526 --> 13:51.189
Declan owned up to that accident.
He's doing community service now.

13:51.263 --> 13:54.027
Ah... Well, I feel so much better.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.003
I was his age once.
I know how boys like him think.

14:01.073 --> 14:03.405
Oh, really? How's that?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.478
I don't like to think about it.

14:07.446 --> 14:10.904
No, I'm serious, Lori.
I don't trust him.

14:11.917 --> 14:15.080
Well, then I guess
you'll just have to trust me.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.950
- So now you got super-hearing?
- No. My ears work just like yours.

14:23.963 --> 14:27.330
But when I concentrate,
my brain can pick up specific sounds.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.663
I can hear voices from a distance.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.662
You wanna find Tom Foss and listen in.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.467
Help me track him down.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.633
- Just say when.
- Now.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.852
Declan, tell me you didn't forget.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.786
I didn't. But can we hook up
at the carnival instead?

14:49.855 --> 14:53.018
<i>- Why?
- Something came up.</i>

14:54.460 --> 14:56.223
Not too vague.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.525
I'm sorry.
I got pulled into something.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.430
Be straight with me.
I don't want to start this again.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.594
There's nothing to start.
I have to meet later, all right?

15:04.670 --> 15:06.137
Fine.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.270
What's up?

15:12.344 --> 15:15.871
Declan just totally bailed on me
and he's acting all shady.

15:15.948 --> 15:19.042
- Tell me I'm being paranoid.
- Yeah, you're being paranoid.

15:19.985 --> 15:23.079
What, no conspiracy theory
to bolster my neurosis?

15:23.155 --> 15:25.919
- Lori, I got to go.
- Are you with your mystery man?

15:25.991 --> 15:29.256
About to be.
I'll try to swing by later.

15:37.803 --> 15:40.271
Look, I can't give out Tom's address.

15:40.339 --> 15:42.500
We need to find him, Kim.
It's important.

15:42.574 --> 15:45.270
Leave your name and number,
I'll have him call you.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.471
- But we have to see him now.
- Hey.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.480
- There she is.
- Hello?

15:50.015 --> 15:53.883
Look, that information
is private and confidential.

15:53.953 --> 15:58.720
- What are they talking about?
- First of all, I wouldn't...

16:02.561 --> 16:04.586
- Happy Hour.
- I knew it.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.960
- How'd you know that?
- I read their lips.

16:11.737 --> 16:14.103
She put on quite a show.

16:14.206 --> 16:16.333
Look, I had three margaritas.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.972
So, what's the cute one saying?

16:22.614 --> 16:24.912
- Which one's the cute one?
- Hold on.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.642
You want to know more?

16:27.720 --> 16:31.156
That information
is private and confidential.

16:31.223 --> 16:33.657
Look, I'd really like to help you,
but I can't.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.093
The truth is, Tom's the security guard
in our neighborhood,

16:37.196 --> 16:39.756
and he got us out of a huge mess.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.635
We want to see him right away
to pay him back.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.532
Fine.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.773
- Foss doesn't live far.
- Then let's go.

16:53.345 --> 16:56.974
- Look at you, ready for a stakeout.
- I don't wanna waste more time.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.800
I found Foss.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.502
<i>- Is the boy with him?
- No.</i>

17:31.383 --> 17:35.012
- I taught you better than that.
- Is that any way to say hello?

17:35.087 --> 17:37.783
- What do you want?
- I'm sure you know.

17:37.856 --> 17:41.019
You betray the company,
all we worked for, to end up as what?

17:41.093 --> 17:43.186
Some neighborhood watchman?

17:44.596 --> 17:46.757
You kill me they'll send somebody else.

17:46.865 --> 17:49.732
They'll keep searching
until they find the subject.

17:49.802 --> 17:52.168
- He's not a subject.
- See?

17:53.338 --> 17:55.431
You let your heart get in the way.

17:55.507 --> 17:59.876
You know, this humanity of yours has
really made a mess of things, hasn't it?

17:59.945 --> 18:01.970
You had to kill Kern and Bunker.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.882
I mean, look what protecting this boy
has cost you.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.779
Just tell me where he is
and be done with it.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.619
He's gone.

18:14.159 --> 18:17.026
He's gone so far away
they'll never find him.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.791
Oh, we will.

18:18.864 --> 18:22.197
And we're watching you, Tom.
If that boy comes anywhere near you,

18:22.267 --> 18:24.235
we're gonna get him.

18:28.907 --> 18:30.966
You stay away from him.

18:32.344 --> 18:33.971
You understand?

19:16.221 --> 19:19.748
She sent someone. Cyrus Reynolds.
He's the Head of Security.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.089
<i>What did you tell him?</i>

19:22.161 --> 19:25.187
I said they'd never find him.
But they're on the trail...

19:32.905 --> 19:34.600
This is it, 509.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.544
What do you hear?
Is he in there?

19:44.950 --> 19:47.475
We have to take him out fast.

19:48.554 --> 19:52.581
<i>- That plan is already in motion.
- OK. I'll keep track of the boy.</i>

19:52.658 --> 19:56.321
<i>No. They're watching you.
Don't interfere.</i>

19:56.929 --> 20:00.797
<i>I need to ask you something
and I want you to be straight with me.</i>

20:00.866 --> 20:03.391
<i>I'm not in the mood
for one of those talks now.</i>

20:03.468 --> 20:06.301
<i>Look, it's not about you,
it's about Kyle.</i>

20:06.371 --> 20:08.703
<i>- He's been acting strange lately.
- Nicole.</i>

20:08.774 --> 20:11.937
- What about her?
- And Lori. I can hear them inside.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.706
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Acting strange?</i>

20:14.780 --> 20:17.146
<i>- This is news to you why?
- I'm serious.</i>

20:17.816 --> 20:21.115
<i>Ever since you took him to
the university, he's been distant.</i>

20:21.186 --> 20:24.053
<i>Did anything happen there
that I should know about?</i>

20:24.122 --> 20:27.455
You mean aside from him seeing
that picture of his look-alike?

20:27.526 --> 20:29.153
<i>Of course Kyle's freaked out.</i>

20:29.228 --> 20:31.492
I just wish he would
talk to me about it.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.930
<i>- You can't be on him all the time.
- Well, I'm his therapist.</i>

20:35.000 --> 20:38.299
<i>Give him some space,
like you do me and Josh.</i>

20:38.370 --> 20:40.201
<i>More flashes of light.</i>

20:40.272 --> 20:42.832
<i>The harder I tried to listen,
the more intense.</i>

20:42.941 --> 20:46.843
<i>You try to let us figure things
out and then you tell us what to do.</i>

20:46.912 --> 20:49.142
Kyle, are you all right?

20:51.016 --> 20:52.506
Yeah.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.148
But I heard them.

20:56.221 --> 20:58.519
Lori and Nicole,
I heard their voices.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.887
That's impossible.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.361
He's coming.

21:22.848 --> 21:25.817
- We have to go in.
- You want to break into his apartment?

21:25.917 --> 21:29.478
No. But I have to know
why I heard them inside.

21:29.588 --> 21:31.146
That is bizarre.

21:31.757 --> 21:32.917
How do we do it?

21:35.894 --> 21:37.384
Come on.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.827
Looking for loose change?

21:47.139 --> 21:49.300
No. I was just...

21:49.374 --> 21:52.207
Skip the story
and just tell me what's going on.

21:52.277 --> 21:53.608
OK, fine.

21:53.679 --> 21:57.115
- How bad are they?
- What?

21:57.182 --> 21:58.513
My grades.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.948
I know they came in today,

22:00.018 --> 22:03.078
and you and Mom are just
making me sweat to torture me.

22:03.155 --> 22:07.524
No, well, as appealing as that sounds,
the mail hasn't even come yet.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.620
- Great.
- I see you've been applying yourself.

22:11.697 --> 22:13.665
What do you have to worry about?

22:15.767 --> 22:17.291
Josh?

22:19.271 --> 22:23.435
Look, I've tried.
I've done all the work, I really have.

22:23.542 --> 22:27.273
And if I bomb out in remedial...
which means...

22:27.346 --> 22:30.509
It just means you're gonna
have to work a little harder.

22:30.615 --> 22:34.107
But don't get ahead of yourself.
You've got good news coming.

22:34.186 --> 22:39.123
- You have to say that.
- No, I don't. I just believe in you.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.386
I think you should too.

22:44.563 --> 22:46.292
So...

22:46.365 --> 22:50.267
...can this vote of confidence translate
into an extra 20 for the carnival?

22:52.070 --> 22:55.528
- Always working it.
- Saw my chance. I had to take it.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.635
At least we know they aren't tied up.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.439
I know what I heard.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.537
Got your wires crossed, buddy.

23:48.727 --> 23:50.957
Don't touch anything.

23:51.696 --> 23:53.129
Nothing to touch.

23:54.299 --> 23:56.460
This guy lives like a monk.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.168
Except for that.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.901
That's pretty high-tech.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.424
What the?

24:28.900 --> 24:30.629
This guy's a frigging stalker.

24:34.172 --> 24:37.141
<i>You give me every single detail
of your sex life.</i>

24:37.209 --> 24:38.540
<i>More than I need to know.</i>

24:38.610 --> 24:42.068
<i>Now you've got this mystery man
and you don't kiss and tell?</i>

24:42.147 --> 24:45.310
<i>Why is it so important to you?</i>

24:45.417 --> 24:47.442
<i>Because I know what you're hiding.</i>

24:48.620 --> 24:49.985
<i>I know it's Declan.</i>

24:50.088 --> 24:51.988
How could she think that?

24:52.057 --> 24:55.788
<i>- Oh, my God. You're insane.
- I'm not stupid.</i>

24:55.861 --> 24:59.524
Right now, you are.
It's not Declan, OK? I swear.

25:01.099 --> 25:05.195
You know, not everything
has to do with you and your boyfriend.

25:05.270 --> 25:06.999
I gotta go.

25:09.774 --> 25:12.402
This is sick.
We gotta rip these damn cameras out.

26:03.862 --> 26:05.295
The subject's in sight.

26:08.934 --> 26:10.697
But he's not alone.

26:10.769 --> 26:14.933
Find your moment... then do it.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.103
Josh?

26:50.575 --> 26:51.940
Josh!

26:54.012 --> 26:56.105
- We need to see you.
- What did I do?

26:56.181 --> 26:57.671
Got the mail.

27:12.931 --> 27:14.558
I did it.

27:15.934 --> 27:18.767
- You did it.
- I'm out of remedial!

27:19.871 --> 27:21.395
What's going on?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.634
Check it out. I'm a genius!

27:25.276 --> 27:29.508
- With a B-plus, two B's and a C?
- Josh, congratulations.

27:30.415 --> 27:32.975
- And Kyle didn't help me at all.
- Where is Kyle?

27:33.084 --> 27:36.383
He just called. He's going straight
to the carnival with Declan.

27:36.454 --> 27:38.012
Declan?

27:39.791 --> 27:42.157
Get away from me,
you little creep!

27:42.260 --> 27:46.321
- Yeah! I'm a genius! I'm a genius!
- You're a genius.

27:46.765 --> 27:49.529
Oh, right. Yeah!

28:07.919 --> 28:10.217
...go around and stuff.
- Oh, wow!

28:20.365 --> 28:23.732
Meet me out front in two hours
and don't come near me until then.

28:23.835 --> 28:26.065
It's not me you should
be worried about.

28:26.137 --> 28:27.866
- It's the carnies.
- Who?

28:27.939 --> 28:31.807
Circus folk. Chicks with beards,
fortune tellers.

28:32.477 --> 28:34.809
They totally abduct teenage girls.

28:34.879 --> 28:37.313
Like I'm scared.
I live with a freak show.

28:42.454 --> 28:43.921
Later.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.528
Oh, yeah.

28:50.595 --> 28:52.620
- I know he's so...
- Hello, ladies.

28:53.331 --> 28:56.300
I want to go on a ride.
Why can't we?

28:57.969 --> 29:00.130
Hey, Kyle, see you later, all right?

29:39.878 --> 29:42.608
Hey, Kyle.
Checking out a ride?

29:42.680 --> 29:45.114
Go on The Rotor, dude.
It's crazy.

29:45.183 --> 29:48.152
- I won't go near it.
- Which one do you like?

29:49.087 --> 29:52.523
Charlie will make fun,
but... the carousel.

29:52.590 --> 29:56.287
Oh, no, no, no.
The carousel's great... if you're seven.

29:56.361 --> 29:58.488
Well, you don't have to
go on it with me.

29:58.563 --> 30:00.827
What do you think, Kyle?
You up for a spin?

30:00.899 --> 30:02.457
Sounds good.

30:03.568 --> 30:06.128
Oh, go ahead.
Try to contain your excitement.

30:18.716 --> 30:20.547
Look, I'm sorry I had to bail.

30:20.618 --> 30:22.882
Why didn't you just say
you were with Kyle?

30:22.954 --> 30:24.717
I don't know. It's personal.

30:25.957 --> 30:28.926
- What are you two up to?
- I had to help him with something.

30:29.027 --> 30:32.861
- Why are you suspicious all the time?
- Why do you give me reason to be?

30:32.931 --> 30:36.367
Hey, if you want this to work,
you gotta trust me.

30:46.211 --> 30:48.941
- Where should we sit?
- How about these two?

30:50.915 --> 30:53.475
- Sorry.
- I'll stand.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.109
Are you sure?

30:59.624 --> 31:01.353
Here we go.

31:01.426 --> 31:04.395
It gets faster.
Just warning you.

31:04.495 --> 31:05.792
How fast?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.889
Fast enough for a seven-year-old.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.262
- For a seven-year-old?
- Yeah.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.340
See?

31:30.054 --> 31:32.818
- You have to tell her.
- Are you nuts?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.756
Lori thought I was with her.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.465
It's not my fault
Lori doesn't trust you.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.474
Oh, like Amanda trusts you?

32:05.657 --> 32:09.024
I've got a great thing going with her
and I'm not going to ruin it.

32:10.828 --> 32:14.662
Great for you. Go out with Amanda,
tap Hilary on the side.

32:18.703 --> 32:22.070
Kyle? Are you all right?

32:24.142 --> 32:25.268
I'm fine.

32:46.564 --> 32:48.930
Kyle, relax. This is fun.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.274
You taught me well after all.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.182
Going to shoot me
in front of all these people?

33:05.249 --> 33:07.080
You know how it works, Tom.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.278
A shot or two out of nowhere.

33:10.755 --> 33:14.589
Mass hysteria always provides
an escape route.

33:16.094 --> 33:19.188
<i>I struggled to hear them
and I knew if I tried any harder,</i>

33:19.263 --> 33:22.096
<i>it might bring back
more of those uncomfortable flashes.</i>

33:22.166 --> 33:24.396
<i>But I had to hear what they were saying.</i>

33:26.004 --> 33:27.972
You should have obeyed orders.

33:29.307 --> 33:31.935
You should have terminated him
per instruction.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.978
Well, it's done now. It's too late.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.806
The boy doesn't know anything.

33:36.881 --> 33:39.714
Your mistake
could expose the company.

33:43.354 --> 33:46.289
Everything we've ever worked for
could be destroyed.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.224
Leave him alone.

34:04.075 --> 34:06.566
Kyle! Oh, my God!

34:06.644 --> 34:08.804
Help! Kyle! Please!

34:08.880 --> 34:10.848
- Somebody help!
- Call 9-1-1.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.608
Kyle! Kyle! Kyle!

34:16.219 --> 34:18.188
Kyle! Kyle! Please!

34:22.393 --> 34:24.452
Kyle! Oh, my God! Kyle!

34:25.830 --> 34:28.355
Somebody please! He needs help!

34:28.433 --> 34:29.866
Kyle!

34:40.078 --> 34:41.443
Kyle's a lucky young man.

34:41.512 --> 34:44.174
Vitals are stable
and he's resting comfortably.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.876
- Why did this happen?
- It's hard to say.

34:46.951 --> 34:49.920
Seizures are generated
by electricity in the brain.

34:50.021 --> 34:52.751
Any number of things
could've triggered this.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.792
Has Kyle bumped his head recently?

34:54.891 --> 34:59.056
- Experienced headaches?
- Not that we're aware of.

34:59.130 --> 35:01.428
I know he was
riding on a carousel at the time.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.967
It's possible the motion of the ride,
lights, noise,

35:05.036 --> 35:07.197
might have disoriented him
and set it off.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.568
Could this happen again?

35:08.639 --> 35:11.369
I can't be certain,
and given Kyle's amnesia,

35:11.442 --> 35:14.206
we don't know if he has
a history of seizures.

35:14.312 --> 35:16.280
Fortunately, MRI results are normal.

35:16.380 --> 35:19.076
- Normal?
- Mrs. Trager, that's good news.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.243
No brain damage.
No abnormal activity.

35:21.319 --> 35:25.221
Yes, of course that's wonderful.
Your MRI machine is working properly?

35:25.289 --> 35:28.156
Absolutely.
And our radiologist is one of the best.

35:28.226 --> 35:30.990
So hopefully,
this is an isolated incident,

35:31.062 --> 35:33.826
and Kyle can head home later tonight.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.834
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

35:41.906 --> 35:45.398
I'm telling you.
The sympathy angle works every time.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.034
Chicks eat it up.

35:47.111 --> 35:50.171
- Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
- Pretty good, I guess.

35:50.248 --> 35:52.307
Doctor says
you're gonna be just fine.

35:52.383 --> 35:55.011
Lori, Josh, why don't you
tell everyone Kyle's OK.

35:56.254 --> 35:57.949
Feel better, Kyle.

36:02.693 --> 36:06.356
Do you remember what happened
just before you started feeling sick?

36:06.430 --> 36:08.728
Anything that might have caused this?

36:13.104 --> 36:14.594
No.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.603
So when can I go home?

36:18.342 --> 36:20.902
They want you
to rest a little while longer.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.105
Then we'll go.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.684
- Big relief.
- Yeah.

36:30.755 --> 36:34.054
- I'm surprised by that MRI.
- Yeah, I could tell.

36:34.125 --> 36:38.289
His first MRI, months ago, showed an
extraordinary amount of brain activity.

36:38.396 --> 36:41.456
- They said the equipment malfunctioned.
- But since then,

36:41.532 --> 36:45.366
we've seen what Kyle can do,
how remarkable he can be.

36:45.436 --> 36:49.202
I guess I couldn't help thinking,
maybe it was true.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.832
Maybe his results
really were off the charts.

36:51.909 --> 36:55.811
Instead he's a normal teenage boy
who's incredibly smart.

36:56.747 --> 37:01.707
You're right. Every man
has his price. Even radiologists.

37:01.786 --> 37:06.086
Allowing that boy's true results to
come out would beg too many questions.

37:06.157 --> 37:09.923
Questions that might have unwanted
consequences for the company.

37:09.994 --> 37:13.122
- I won't be able to get to him tonight.
- I'm not concerned.

37:14.665 --> 37:16.292
Next time we will.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.763
I'll be right back.

37:27.345 --> 37:29.643
- Is he OK?
- We're still waiting to hear.

37:30.181 --> 37:33.412
- Lori said he collapsed.
- He was standing right next to me.

37:34.352 --> 37:37.788
He was fine one minute,
then he just fell on the ground shaking.

37:37.855 --> 37:41.018
- It was so scary.
- It's all gonna be OK.

37:41.092 --> 37:44.619
What was he doing right before he fell?

37:44.695 --> 37:47.596
He looked distracted.
He was staring at people

37:47.665 --> 37:50.225
with this really intense look
on his face.

37:52.536 --> 37:55.027
He's doing great. Really.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.802
- When can we see him?
- Better wait till he gets home.

37:58.876 --> 38:01.344
Can you just tell him
I'm thinking about him?

38:02.813 --> 38:04.110
Sure.

38:07.251 --> 38:10.015
- I need to see Kyle.
- Declan, they said just family.

38:10.087 --> 38:12.988
Look, there's stuff going on
that I can't explain,

38:13.057 --> 38:15.082
but it has nothing to do with us.

38:16.193 --> 38:18.218
You have to believe me.

38:20.498 --> 38:22.932
Come on.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.298
You gave us all a big scare, man.

38:27.171 --> 38:29.696
- Sorry.
- You were trying to hear something.

38:32.943 --> 38:35.969
Foss was there.
And another man with a gun.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.413
You got to tell the Tragers
what's going on.

38:38.516 --> 38:39.676
They could get hurt.

38:39.750 --> 38:43.584
But you will if you don't say something.
They're your family.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.123
Now's the time you need them the most.

38:46.223 --> 38:50.387
Thanks.

38:52.229 --> 38:54.720
I may have judged Declan
a little too harshly.

38:54.799 --> 38:56.926
He's a great guy when he wants to be.

38:57.001 --> 39:00.732
Stephen. I just traded calls
with Detective Breen.

39:00.805 --> 39:03.433
- His message said he had news.
- Like what?

39:03.507 --> 39:05.031
He didn't get into it.

39:12.783 --> 39:14.546
Thanks, Declan.

39:16.654 --> 39:18.815
A lot of people were here
for you tonight.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.988
- I don't want you to worry about me.
- Can't help it.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.693
Kyle, we haven't talked lately,

39:30.768 --> 39:33.498
really talked, professionally.

39:34.739 --> 39:39.005
And I've tried not to push you,
but I can't help feeling that...

39:43.681 --> 39:45.239
...I've let you down.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.679
Let me down?

39:49.787 --> 39:52.881
It's my job to help you break through.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.289
To heal you.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.559
- But you have.
- But you haven't been able to remember.

39:59.630 --> 40:03.999
I keep promising answers and
you're left with only more questions.

40:05.603 --> 40:07.366
You took me in.

40:08.506 --> 40:10.371
When I had no one.

40:12.510 --> 40:14.671
You made me feel safe.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.040
And cared for.

40:17.114 --> 40:18.877
And loved.

40:23.754 --> 40:26.985
You made me feel like I was your son.

40:33.898 --> 40:36.389
I think that's what's gotten in our way.

40:39.503 --> 40:41.664
No, it's what I needed.

40:43.474 --> 40:45.499
I still do.

40:48.512 --> 40:50.605
There's something I need to tell you.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.625
Lori Trager?

41:13.237 --> 41:14.761
I need to see your parents.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.682
Kyle, whatever it is, you can tell me.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.958
- Mom?
- Lori, I need a moment with Kyle.

41:38.362 --> 41:40.853
Nicole. This is important.

41:43.567 --> 41:45.262
Mrs. Trager,

41:46.337 --> 41:49.306
there's been a new development.

41:49.373 --> 41:51.307
I'm sorry, we can't wait anymore.

42:01.385 --> 42:03.012
Noah, is that really you?

42:14.865 --> 42:16.093
Who are you?

42:17.334 --> 42:18.892
Don't you remember?

42:20.170 --> 42:22.138
It's me.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.398
It's Mom.

42:31.248 --> 42:33.216
We finally found you.
