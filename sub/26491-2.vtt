16:48.108 --> 16:49.173
Clyve has started working on

16:49.175 --> 16:51.275
these butternut squash shoes
for me.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.977
Guys, I'm pouring the wheel.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.178
ELIZABETH:
Jewel's responsible for this

16:54.180 --> 16:56.547
unicycle out of cast sugar.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.017
Come on, sugar baby.
Be good to your sugar mama.

16:59.019 --> 17:02.320
She's also going to make balloon
animals out of blown sugar.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.322
Well, we got one
balloon animal.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.658
The clown head
is coming on nicely.
Oh, yay!

17:07.660 --> 17:09.427
The hardest thing to pull off
in this challenge

17:09.429 --> 17:12.196
is gonna be the clown
because it's so big,

17:12.198 --> 17:15.800
and that structure, that's gonna
take a lot of time.

17:15.802 --> 17:16.934
-Hi.
-Hey.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.970
-Are you our assistant?
-All righty.

17:18.972 --> 17:21.439
Winning the Small Scare,
you get an extra helper,

17:21.441 --> 17:23.841
and it's great to have
an extra pair of hands.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.310
I have to get the shape
of this clown together.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.379
For our designs,
were gonna do a clown

17:28.381 --> 17:30.681
bashing a zombie
into the ground.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.151
I am going to do the clown
out of cake,

17:33.153 --> 17:35.119
rice cereal treat,
and modeling chocolate.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.455
So I'm gonna take these
leaves and place them

17:37.457 --> 17:38.956
around his wrist,

17:38.958 --> 17:41.325
and then I'm gonna also
place them around his collar.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.162
For the head, I wanted to get
this scary-looking man

17:44.164 --> 17:46.564
with really icky hair
hanging down.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.599
SHELBY:
So I'm making the dead roses.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.469
Shelby makes these beautiful,
dark sugar flowers.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.805
Shelby's got to make the eyes
for the zombie and the clown.

17:53.807 --> 17:54.939
SHELBY:
This is like wafer paper.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.541
I'm using it to cover
the backboard.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.709
KIMBERLY: And Shelby is also
gonna do the cemetery scene,

17:58.711 --> 18:01.145
and it's gonna be made
out of edible paint, fondant,

18:01.147 --> 18:03.014
and some modeling
chocolate for texture.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.982
We got to move like
we got purpose here.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.751
The zombie head, arms, and body

18:06.753 --> 18:08.086
are gonna be made
out of pumpkin.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.487
Hey, Lenny, how it's going
with that pumpkin?

18:09.489 --> 18:11.122
Too slow for me.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.590
So here's zombie.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.060
I'm going to start putting some
sagging green flesh on him.

18:16.062 --> 18:20.131
We have decided to do
a traveling circus brother duo.

18:20.133 --> 18:24.135
Unfortunately, one of them gets
infected with the zombie virus.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.937
Trust my genius, guys.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay. Sorry, sorry.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.205
-Trust my genius.
-All right.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.374
For the backdrop, we paint
this circus tent

18:30.376 --> 18:32.810
and a road that
the clown car is on.

18:32.812 --> 18:36.581
We also have a tree
with chocolate tree bark.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.282
I'm gonna put
some pants on him.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.151
Everybody's better with pants.

18:40.153 --> 18:43.020
The zombie is going to be
made of rice cereal treats,

18:43.022 --> 18:45.957
modeling chocolate,
with aged fondant clothing.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.925
Curl it down.
That's perfect
for a front of a car.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.160
Kind of a clowny car, right?

18:49.162 --> 18:51.095
For our pumpkin element,
we're going to have

18:51.097 --> 18:53.865
a clown car
with pumpkin wheels.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.968
It's not just one pumpkin.
It's not two pumpkins.

18:56.970 --> 19:00.538
It's seven pumpkins
to create this pumpkin car.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.807
I'm making the windshield,
guys.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.642
Orly's going to do
a poured sugar windshield

19:04.644 --> 19:06.210
for our pumpkin car.

19:06.212 --> 19:09.113
I'll make sure that these
flowers are nice and shiny.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.683
CYNTHIA: He is also creating
a sugar flower for the zombie

19:12.685 --> 19:13.985
to wear on his lapel.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.120
Orly, can you pull
a sugar shoelace?

19:16.122 --> 19:17.622
Sugar shoelace,
you kidding me?

19:17.624 --> 19:21.359
I am just working on the jester.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.761
Our idea is that when
the zombie apocalypse happens,

19:23.763 --> 19:26.030
that castle jester
smashes the other zombies

19:26.032 --> 19:27.198
with his mallet.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.432
I love carving zombie heads,

19:28.434 --> 19:30.635
so I'm pretty much
in my element right now.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.370
The zombie king is going
to be made of pumpkin

19:32.372 --> 19:34.238
smashed into a bunch
of different parts.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.174
So I'm gonna be doing
parts of his face

19:36.176 --> 19:37.441
and parts of his bones.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.544
-Check out the zombie head.
-Nice.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.612
Sabrina's doing the jester
made of cake,

19:41.614 --> 19:43.047
fondant, and modeling chocolate.

19:43.049 --> 19:46.050
-Sabrina, check this gold.
-Pretty.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.185
JEFF:
We really want to sell this

19:47.187 --> 19:48.586
as an elegant king's chamber.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.555
Cesar's gonna be doing
all of the sugar work

19:50.557 --> 19:51.656
for this art piece,

19:51.658 --> 19:52.790
and it's gonna be poured sugar

19:52.792 --> 19:55.059
and molded sugar
with some flowers on top.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.428
CESAR: Beautiful. Work with me.
Love it.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.031
I like his belly.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.465
He's a fat little clown.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.335
The idea for our story is
the circus set up camp

20:04.337 --> 20:06.604
right next to a graveyard
where the zombies are living.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.239
The zombies aren't
happy about this,

20:08.241 --> 20:10.341
so they've stolen
one of the clown cars

20:10.343 --> 20:11.709
and are chasing
them out of town.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.977
This is a work out.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.311
The whole belly of the clown

20:14.313 --> 20:16.714
is all chocolate cake
with buttercream

20:16.716 --> 20:18.282
and modeling chocolate.

20:18.284 --> 20:22.887
Next, I start clothing my clown
with fondant and then the head.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.022
I want to wow these
judges this time.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.991
How are you on
your schedule, Tom?

20:26.993 --> 20:29.794
I'm on time, surprisingly.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.563
Tom is gonna take
on the car and the zombie.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.733
Tom picks out two pumpkins that
are the right size for the car.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.035
He also needs some pieces
that will make the door,

20:38.037 --> 20:40.338
and we actually have
a motorized turnkey

20:40.340 --> 20:42.240
that's spinning around
on the toy car.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.141
Yeah, that's awesome.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.676
I'm gonna go ahead
and start the wheels.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.179
CORINNA: Josh was going to make
the hubcaps of the car.

20:48.181 --> 20:50.047
These are layered
bits of isomalts.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.950
I've got the wheels completed.
They're ready to put on.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.686
CORINNA: And we're going to cut
out a big circle in the backdrop

20:55.688 --> 20:58.689
and put an isomalt moon
that's going to be backlit.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.757
This is gonna be beautiful.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.426
-Let me not torch my face off.
-Or mine.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.863
Am I a scary clown or what?
[ Chomping sounds ]

21:05.865 --> 21:07.598
Look, I can eat people.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.168
[ Chomping sounds ]

21:11.170 --> 21:13.571
Ah! Ah! Oh, my!

21:13.573 --> 21:16.807
Four hours!
Four hours left!

21:16.809 --> 21:19.810
Oh, my god.
Four hours left.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.279
What's wrong with him?

21:21.281 --> 21:23.948
I think he had a children's
birthday to go to.
Todd!

21:23.950 --> 21:25.182
CESAR: How you doing, Jeff?

21:25.184 --> 21:28.719
I'm just carving up chunks
of hammered zombie.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.122
This is your windshield,
whenever you're ready.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.890
All right.

21:32.892 --> 21:36.027
This is the watermelon
zombie head. I'm --

21:36.029 --> 21:37.295
I've never seen someone
carve a watermelon before,

21:37.297 --> 21:38.763
so I'm super excited
to see how you do it.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.866
Clyve's going to make this
zombie head out of watermelon,

21:41.868 --> 21:43.401
and with the watermelon,

21:43.403 --> 21:46.671
you actually have the red that
grins through the deeper you go,

21:46.673 --> 21:48.739
so it already kind
of looks gory.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.174
I've got to get
those cupcakes out.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.243
Jewel's also are doing
our tasting element,

21:52.245 --> 21:55.713
a death by chocolate cake with
this chocolate mousse on top

21:55.715 --> 21:58.082
with this Merlot caramel drizzle

21:58.084 --> 21:59.617
with a chocolate zombie hand

21:59.619 --> 22:01.886
coming out of the top
of the cupcake.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.221
-How you feeling, Cynthia?
-Let's do this.

22:04.223 --> 22:06.424
For the zombie head,
we poured white chocolate

22:06.426 --> 22:07.658
into a skull mold,

22:07.660 --> 22:10.461
let it set and then
some modeling chocolate

22:10.463 --> 22:12.096
to fill in the fine details.

22:12.098 --> 22:14.565
The clown is silly
and a troublemaker,

22:14.567 --> 22:17.268
and the zombie is just forlorn.

22:17.270 --> 22:19.837
I never made hair out of candy.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.105
For the sugar hair,

22:21.107 --> 22:23.808
Orly starts off
with a puck of isomalt,

22:23.810 --> 22:25.343
and he starts pulling it.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.411
And by pulling it,
he's going to create

22:27.413 --> 22:29.613
this really nice and shiny hair

22:29.615 --> 22:31.248
for both the clown
and the zombie.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.250
I need those heads.
How about that one?

22:33.252 --> 22:34.485
-No, we don't want that.
-Is it ready yet?

22:34.487 --> 22:35.920
We got to give them put on
before you add the hair,

22:35.922 --> 22:37.421
I think.
-I know.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.323
It smells good
over there, Joshua.

22:39.325 --> 22:40.758
Hey, thanks.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.892
What are you doing, anyway?

22:41.894 --> 22:44.995
Joshua's making something
kind of gross.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.964
Is he moving?
Cluster, no,
they're freeze dried.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.933
-Are you sure?
-As far as I know.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.268
Caramel corn,
perfect for the circus

22:51.270 --> 22:55.306
with a zombie element
of chocolate covered crickets.

22:55.308 --> 22:56.640
Oh, that's disgusting.

22:56.642 --> 22:59.143
So I'm going to make little
bitty cricket clusters.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.511
I think this tasting element

23:00.513 --> 23:02.313
is gonna stand out
from the rest.

23:02.315 --> 23:05.015
Whether the judges will actually
eat it or not, I don't know.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.650
-Eat one.
-Not yet.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.220
-I want chocolate on it.
-Yeah.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.955
Hopefully, it tastes
as good as it looks.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.390
No two zombies are the same.

23:12.392 --> 23:15.826
KIMBERLY: So Shelby's making
mold of cut up faces and zombies

23:15.828 --> 23:17.328
to add to the background.

23:17.330 --> 23:20.030
-Kim, that looks amazing.
-Thanks.

23:20.032 --> 23:22.066
And I'm taking charge
of the clown from head to toe,

23:22.068 --> 23:24.168
so I have to cover
her body in fondant,

23:24.170 --> 23:25.770
and then I'm gonna
work on the head.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.438
Hey, Lenny, how's it going
with that pumpkin?

23:27.440 --> 23:29.006
The pumpkin is shredding,

23:29.008 --> 23:31.509
so it's disintegrating
in front of my face.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.778
Lenny's having problems
with the zombie pumpkin head.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.713
You see this?

23:35.715 --> 23:37.581
See how it just shreds?

23:37.583 --> 23:40.151
I keep cutting it away
to get away from the shred,

23:40.153 --> 23:41.385
and then I have no meat.

23:41.387 --> 23:43.087
Lenny's trying to cut
these pumpkin pieces up

23:43.089 --> 23:44.488
to make something happen,

23:44.490 --> 23:47.258
and he can't get this
pumpkin to work at all,

23:47.260 --> 23:51.462
and I don't have time to do it,
so what are we gonna do?

23:51.464 --> 23:54.665
The head is garbage.
That's it.

23:56.903 --> 23:57.968
Aw, [bleep].

23:57.970 --> 23:59.236
Lenny's doing a zombie
on a pumpkin,

23:59.238 --> 24:03.407
but he can't get this
pumpkin to work at all.

24:03.409 --> 24:04.708
That's it.

24:04.710 --> 24:07.144
Mnh-mnh. We don't quit.
That's not what we do.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.946
Feel like I'm letting
everybody down.
No, you're not.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.948
It doesn't have to be
a complete body.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.483
As long as we have pumpkin
on there, we're good.

24:12.485 --> 24:13.784
You do this the best
that you can,

24:13.786 --> 24:15.152
and then you get
another medium,

24:15.154 --> 24:16.654
and you show your
sculpting skills.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.857
Lenny, you're going to
sculpt us a zombie

24:19.859 --> 24:21.192
out of modeling chocolate.

24:21.194 --> 24:23.394
You're a sculptor.
You can do this.

24:23.396 --> 24:24.829
You're going to knock
that zombie out.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.430
It's gonna be interesting.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.199
Do you guys think
you'll be done in time

24:28.201 --> 24:29.500
to, like, lend me a hand?

24:29.502 --> 24:32.136
I was actually gonna ask
the same of you.
No.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.805
The idea for our story is that
the zombies have stolen

24:34.807 --> 24:37.541
one of the clown cars and are
chasing them out of town.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.510
This is gonna be
incredibly tight.

24:39.512 --> 24:42.880
I think maybe we've bitten off
more than we can chew again.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.448
How far behind do you
think we are?

24:44.450 --> 24:47.151
Biggest thing I need to do
is finish carving the zombie,

24:47.153 --> 24:48.252
and then I got to paint it,

24:48.254 --> 24:49.920
but we really need
to get things on there.

24:49.922 --> 24:54.024
Tom has to build up and block
the entire zombie structure.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.593
Then we got to get the head
and arm on there.

One thing that's really cool
about marzipan people don't know

about is that
it has rosewater in it.

a marzipan zombie head.

of each zombie head.

looks amazing,

pumpkin on the display.

Jewel has this idea
of scrapping the cannon.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.645

focus on making a better piece

trying to rush it.

to properly stand up,

I might be able to make it
like an upside down unicycle.

kind of creepy.

creepy expression.

the shape of a red clown nose,

all of the other clown zombies

that heavier center.

33:19.164 --> 33:22.833
Sabrina, you were working on
this character the entire time.

33:22.835 --> 33:24.568
You know what?
It was worth it.

33:24.570 --> 33:27.571
That is the star of this piece.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.806
The flowers are
really beautiful,

33:29.808 --> 33:33.477
but it doesn't fit in
with the eerie display here.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.679
You've brought it.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.148
That character is fantastic.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.550
Obviously, the star
of this is the jester.

33:40.552 --> 33:44.221
It comes to life and to death
at the same time.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.922
Great job, guys.
Thank you very much.

33:45.924 --> 33:47.224
Zesty Zombies.

33:47.226 --> 33:50.560
SHELBY: Our killer clown
is on a rampage.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.863
Behind him, he has all
the zombie heads

33:52.865 --> 33:54.531
that he's been collecting.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.933
The clown is made out of cake.

33:56.935 --> 33:58.368
The eyes are sugar.

33:58.370 --> 34:02.506
The zombie is modeling
chocolate, pulled sugar roses,

34:02.508 --> 34:04.808
and then we have
a pumpkin root.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.076
So I made zombie heads.

34:06.078 --> 34:10.113
Marzipan with coconut
with a almond center.

34:10.115 --> 34:12.449
TUCKER:
The clown is horrifying.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.618
The face on that clown,
the eyes on that clown,

34:14.620 --> 34:18.088
the teeth on that clown,
that culture is dynamite,

34:18.090 --> 34:20.991
but you're spending so much time
making that clown face.

34:20.993 --> 34:22.926
If you had just taken
both those characters

34:22.928 --> 34:24.694
and just shifted them out,

34:24.696 --> 34:25.996
I still would've got
what they were doing,

34:25.998 --> 34:28.198
but I could've seen them
and all the beautiful work

34:28.200 --> 34:30.367
that you guys did.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.768
With the tasting element,

34:31.770 --> 34:33.970
the almond on the inside
was raw,

34:33.972 --> 34:36.039
and I think that if you had
roasted that almond,

34:36.041 --> 34:39.076
it would've just had
a little bit more depth to it.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.977
The roses are really beautiful,

34:40.979 --> 34:43.780
and the sheen really
brings them to life.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.348
Thank you.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.684
This is a tableau that I see
in a comic book coming to life.

34:47.686 --> 34:51.488
This clown is phenomenal from
the face on through the body.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.857
Zesty Zombies,
congrats, great work.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.659
Beastly Banshees, you're up.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.028
Our story is,
circus has come to town,

34:58.030 --> 35:01.731
so zombies steal a clown car
and chase them out of town.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.867
The clown, he's got
a full cake belly,

35:03.869 --> 35:05.268
a rice cereal treats head.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.737
He is holding
an isomalt balloon.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.806
The car is actually made
completely in pumpkin

35:09.808 --> 35:11.541
and same with
the zombie itself.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.977
The moon is also
isomalt and backlit.

35:13.979 --> 35:16.379
The tasting element,
we did a caramel corn

35:16.381 --> 35:17.981
with chocolate coated nuts

35:17.983 --> 35:21.618
and freeze dried crickets
tossed in chocolate.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.187
-Actual crickets?
-[ Laughs ]

35:24.189 --> 35:27.824
They're nice and crunchy.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.494
The caramel popcorn was good.

35:30.496 --> 35:32.262
The cricket, not so much.

35:32.264 --> 35:36.366
It kind of tasted like rocks
mixed with river lake.

35:36.368 --> 35:38.702
It was kind of gross.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.170
I like the car.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.772
The car and there's a lot of
personality coming out of that.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.308
The clown and the zombie,

35:45.310 --> 35:47.644
I feel like the level
of the finish on these

35:47.646 --> 35:50.413
is a little bit amateur.

35:50.415 --> 35:52.382
That moon is mesmerizing,

35:52.384 --> 35:54.351
and the fact that you placed
the lights behind it

35:54.353 --> 35:57.787
just really draws my eyes to it.

35:57.789 --> 36:00.857
These characters remind me
of these monster stickers

36:00.859 --> 36:03.927
I had as a kid that we all used
to stick on our notebook.

36:03.929 --> 36:07.564
As a result, I kind of like this
in its simplicity.

36:07.566 --> 36:10.100
Beastly Banshees,
thank you very much.

36:10.102 --> 36:11.434
CORINNA:
I'm a little nervous.

36:11.436 --> 36:14.404
As much fun as it was watching
the judges eat crickets,

36:14.406 --> 36:16.506
maybe it was a step too far.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.874
Grave Expectations.

36:17.876 --> 36:21.278
For our piece, we decided
to do clowns versus zombies

36:21.280 --> 36:22.445
with the clown being the winner.

36:22.447 --> 36:24.948
The clown is cake
covered in fondant.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.117
The clown's nose is
blown sugar.

36:27.119 --> 36:30.287
The zombie head
is out of a watermelon.

36:30.289 --> 36:33.924
Today, we have a death
by chocolate zombie cupcake,

36:33.926 --> 36:36.426
dark chocolate with a light
cocoa mousse

36:36.428 --> 36:38.995
and a Merlot caramel finish.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.231
Jewel, girl, you can bake.

36:41.233 --> 36:43.533
That was a really moist
chocolate cake,

36:43.535 --> 36:44.634
but you know what?

36:44.636 --> 36:47.070
Elizabeth, you are a star.

36:47.072 --> 36:49.839
This is the best clown
I've seen on "Halloween Wars,"

36:49.841 --> 36:52.075
and we've seen
many creepy clowns.

36:52.077 --> 36:54.010
The paint job, the sculpting,

36:54.012 --> 36:58.648
the eyes, the makeup is
your classic clown makeup.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.350
Now, here is the problem.

37:00.352 --> 37:03.553
If you had taken your clown
and put him dead center,

37:03.555 --> 37:06.156
the balance of this whole piece
would've worked beautifully.

37:06.158 --> 37:09.559
You have a giant void there,
which my eye is going to even

37:09.561 --> 37:12.162
though that clown
is as amazing as it is.

37:12.164 --> 37:14.197
I just know I'm going home.

is impressive enough.

Right now, we're feeling
really good.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.109
They absolutely loved the clown.

37:26.111 --> 37:28.211
They loved the overall
theme of everything.

37:28.213 --> 37:30.247
We think we could
really win this.

The judges said that the clown
and the zombie

37:32.584 --> 37:34.618
was elementary or juvenile.

the one to go home.

Five amazing teams
with five awesome displays.

37:44.196 --> 37:45.362
This is gonna be tough.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.297
Let's talk about
Monsters of Mayhem.

37:47.299 --> 37:49.399
That jester was to die for.

37:49.401 --> 37:51.835
Now, Cesar could've brought it
a little bit more.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.871
What he did here
is very sugar sculpture 101.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.073
If he had created something
that would fit in

37:57.075 --> 37:58.875
with a castle scene --
-Right.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.710
...I think it would've be
a lot more appropriate.
Torch, sconce or something.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.445
-You know?
-Mm-hmm. I agree, yep.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.447
I really liked Cesar's treat.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.016
When I first picked it up,
it felt like a little ball

38:06.018 --> 38:07.250
of clay or something.

38:07.252 --> 38:09.552
But when you bit into it,
it had great dimension.

38:09.554 --> 38:12.622
I love the lightness
of the Bavarian cream.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.791
Let's talk about
Zesty Zombies.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.193
There's really
so much detail here.

38:17.195 --> 38:19.896
Lenny did a great job on that
zombie coming out of the ground,

38:19.898 --> 38:22.065
but the position is turned,
it's just kind of wasted time

38:22.067 --> 38:24.000
if you're gonna spend that
much time on a great sculpture.

38:24.002 --> 38:28.238
I love those pulled flowers,
the luminous finish on there.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.508
But you know what?
I am just not a fan of marzipan.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.543
It tastes like
almond soap to me.

38:33.545 --> 38:36.179
I do like marzipan.
I thought it was well done.

38:36.181 --> 38:37.447
I could do it
without the chocolate.

38:37.449 --> 38:40.116
I think the extra sweetness
on it overdid it.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.018
Now let's talk about
Candied Cadavers.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.554
TUCKER: I do love the idea that
the clown is stealing his arm.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.556
It identify definitely clowns
versus zombies here.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.325
The car is so well done.

38:48.327 --> 38:51.594
If you look closely at
the faces, they're so well done.

38:51.596 --> 38:56.099
The beautiful spun sugar hair
for the clown worked so well.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.500
Right.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.303
But you take the same spun sugar
for the zombie, not so well.

39:00.305 --> 39:02.339
And then we have
the Beastly Banshees.

39:02.341 --> 39:05.709
I appreciate the fact that Tom
did both the zombie

39:05.711 --> 39:07.510
and the car in pumpkin.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.679
I have to say,
that car was very cool.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.281
I love that that had
so much expression,

39:11.283 --> 39:13.516
and the car was alive,
which is a really unique idea.

39:13.518 --> 39:18.054
Overall, the execution was just
a little bit more primitive.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.089
If the car is the best thing,

39:19.091 --> 39:20.623
then you kind of missed
the point.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.325
Shinmin, you should've
seen your face

39:22.327 --> 39:23.927
when you had to eat a cricket.

39:23.929 --> 39:26.396
-What was that like?
-It was pretty nasty.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.331
I mean, I was staring at wings.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.833
The crickets in the food

39:29.835 --> 39:31.401
was probably the scariest
part of the display,

39:31.403 --> 39:34.337

popcorn was all right.
