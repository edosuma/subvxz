WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:03.703
Wilden: WE HAVE
YOUR DAUGHTER ON TAPE

00:03.737 --> 00:05.173
SHOPLIFTING
A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.507
Ashley:
I'M TAKING CARE OF IT.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.176
MY DAD-- IS HE
YOUR FATHER TOO?

00:08.209 --> 00:09.510
WHO TOLD YOU?

00:09.543 --> 00:10.811
MELISSA
DOESN'T KNOW EITHER.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.413
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL HER?

00:12.446 --> 00:13.781
WE'VE GOT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.417
THIS IS A HUGE
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.119
COPIES OF A PARTICULAR PAGE

00:18.152 --> 00:20.221
OF ALISON'S AUTOPSY
REPORT HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.523
THIS IS FROM A SECURITY
CAMERA OUTSIDE THE MORGUE.

00:22.556 --> 00:23.724
JUST MAKING SURE YOU'RE
 IN AS DEEP AS I AM.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.726
SHE'S COMING UPSTAIRS.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.695
THAT'S ALISON, ABOUT TO
WALK IN AND FIND THEM.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.830
VIVIAN OWES YOU MONEY?
TWO THOUSAND.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.067
AND SHE HAD A FRIEND NAMED
ALISON WHO WAS GETTING
TEXTS FROM SOMEBODY.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.402
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.
WHO?

00:34.435 --> 00:36.204
I THINK THAT
I CAN FIND THAT OUT,

00:36.237 --> 00:39.740
BUT I'M GOING TO NEED YOU
TO TRUST ME... $2,000 WORTH.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.178
WE'RE GIVING HIM ALL OF IT?

00:44.212 --> 00:46.147
$2,000 IS A LOT OF MONEY!

00:46.180 --> 00:48.382
EMILY, IF HE CAN FINALLY
TELL ME WHO "A" IS,

00:48.416 --> 00:49.650
I WOULD HAND OVER A MILLION.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.352
YEAH, AND NOT
ASK FOR CHANGE.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.587
HOW'D YOU GET
THE MONEY SO FAST?

00:53.621 --> 00:57.825
WHAT? UM...
I HAVE A RELATIVE.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.293
WHICH ONE?

00:59.327 --> 01:01.595
I PROMISED
THAT I WOULDN'T SAY.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.397
WHAT TIME DID JONAH
SAY TO MEET HIM?

01:03.431 --> 01:06.867
SIX, BUT, UM, LOOK,
NOT ALL OF US ARE
GONNA GO.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.337
TI'S JUST ME AND SPENCER,
SO WE'LL MEET UP WITH YOU
AFTERWARDS.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.339
WHY JUST YOU TWO?

01:11.372 --> 01:13.441
BECAUSE I'M THE FACE
THAT HE KNOWS, AND
SHE'S THE BANK.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.344
IF WE CROWD HIM, HE'S GONNA
THINK SOMETHING'S UP.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.611
SOMETHING IS UP.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.247
WE'RE FINALLY GONNA FIND OUT

01:19.280 --> 01:20.814
WHO'S BEEN TORTURING US
SINCE ALI'S FUNERAL,

01:20.848 --> 01:23.251
AND, HELLO, I KIND OF
WANNA BE THERE FOR THAT.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.252
VOLUME!

01:24.285 --> 01:25.753
Mona: HEY, LADIES!

01:25.786 --> 01:27.821
( unenthused )
HEY.

01:27.855 --> 01:31.359
OKAY. UM, HANNA, CAN I
BORROW YOU FOR A SEC?

01:33.361 --> 01:37.465
Hanna: WHAT'S UP?
CAN YOU DRIVE THIS
AFTERNOON, TO THE MALL?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.633
I THOUGHT I HAD WHEELS,
BUT MY MOM--
WAIT, THAT'S TODAY?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.535
YES!

01:41.569 --> 01:44.738
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA HELP ME PICK OUT
SOMETHING FOR THIS PARTY.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.774
PLEASE DON'T BAIL ON ME.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.777
WHAT'S THE DEAL?
DID SOMETHING MORE
IMPORTANT SUDDENLY POP UP?

01:49.810 --> 01:52.380
NO, NO. IT'S JUST
MY MOM WANTS ME HOME.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.415
COULD WE DO IT TOMORROW?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.750
TOMORROW IS ABOUT
THE ACCESSORIES.
FORGET IT.

01:56.784 --> 02:00.354
LOOK, I'M SORRY, MONA.
I TOTALLY SPACED.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.356
HAN? WE'RE GONNA
GO TO LUNCH.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.358
WE'LL MEET YOU THERE.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.360
DON'T HOLD UP
YOUR FRIENDS, HON.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.928
IT'S NO BIGGIE.
I'LL JUST FIND
SOMEONE ELSE.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.365
NO, WE'LL JUST CUT OUT
AFTER LUNCH TOMORROW.

02:11.399 --> 02:14.635
( cellphone chimes )

02:14.668 --> 02:16.637
WHAT'S UP?
WHO TEXTED YOU?

02:16.670 --> 02:19.240
MONA, WHAT'S WRONG?

02:19.273 --> 02:23.477
NOTHING. SOME IDIOT
JUST GOT THE WRONG NUMBER.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.580
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE'LL TALK SOON, OKAY?

02:35.656 --> 02:36.790
* GOT A SECRET

02:36.824 --> 02:38.326
* CAN YOU KEEP IT?

02:38.359 --> 02:40.294
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

02:40.328 --> 02:42.263
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

02:42.296 --> 02:45.399
* TAKING THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

02:45.433 --> 02:47.635
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

02:47.668 --> 02:50.471
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

02:50.504 --> 02:55.243
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

03:05.953 --> 03:07.721
AFTERNOON, ASHLEY.

03:07.755 --> 03:11.692
( sighs )
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

03:11.725 --> 03:14.662
WELL, YOU'RE NOT RETURNING
ANY OF MY PHONE CALLS.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.929
I NEED TO TALK TO HANNA.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.399
YOU EVER HEAR OF A DOORBELL?

03:18.432 --> 03:19.533
I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T
WANT YOUR NEIGHBORS

03:19.567 --> 03:21.702
TO SEE A COP ON
YOUR DOORSTEP AGAIN.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.371
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
HEY, HANNA.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.573
I JUST HAVE SOME
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS

03:25.606 --> 03:28.276
ABOUT YOUR DRESS-UP DAY AT
THE MORGUE WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.978
COMING HERE
LIKE THIS IS HARASSMENT.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.980
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.983
UNLESS YOU'RE CHARGING
MY DAUGHTER WITH SOMETHING,

03:36.016 --> 03:38.552
WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE
TO TALK ABOUT.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.822
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
NICER TO TALK HERE, BUT...

03:41.855 --> 03:43.624
IF YOU PREFER THE STATION...

03:45.058 --> 03:46.927
THAT'S FINE.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.705
YOU'VE TOLD ME
EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

03:57.738 --> 04:00.341
YEAH. OF COURSE.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.709
Okay.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.711
WE HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.586
WHY WOULD MOM
GO ALONG WITH THIS?

04:12.620 --> 04:16.624
IT WASN'T EASY FOR HER.
SHE'S ANGRY TOO.

04:16.656 --> 04:17.925
SHE FEELS BETRAYED.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.428
DON'T PROTECT HER.
SHE LIED TO US.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.870
MOM'S HAD TO WATCH
JASON EVERY DAY

04:29.903 --> 04:32.406
SINCE HE WAS A LITTLE KID.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.908
I'M SURE SOMEWHERE
IN HER HEART, SHE KNEW.

04:38.379 --> 04:41.715
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN TOO.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.685
IT'S LIKE WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHO MOM
AND DAD ARE ANYMORE.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.354
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.722
WE HAVE TO RETHINK EVERYTHING
THEY'VE EVER TOLD US.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.628
I'M PRETTY SURE ALISON KNEW.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.365
REALLY? WHY?

04:57.398 --> 05:00.033
I DON'T KNOW, JUST...

05:00.067 --> 05:02.903
LITTLE THINGS SHE'D SAY.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.605
DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW?

05:04.638 --> 05:07.107
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.777
THEN LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.779
OUR FAMILY HAS SUFFERED
ENOUGH HUMILIATION

05:11.812 --> 05:13.614
FOR TEN LIFETIMES.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.055
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE
WHEN MOM AND DAD GET HOME.

05:22.089 --> 05:26.059
UM... I'LL
CALL YOU LATER, OKAY?

05:26.093 --> 05:27.728
YEAH.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.999
SPENCER...
HMM?

05:32.032 --> 05:33.767
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.415
Woman: ...YOU'RE TRYING
 TO REACH IS UNAVAILABLE.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.549
( beep )

05:48.582 --> 05:49.983
WHY AREN'T YOU
CALLING ME BACK?

05:50.017 --> 05:51.952
IF SILENCE IS YOUR WAY
OF BREAKING UP WITH ME,

05:51.985 --> 05:54.021
THEN I'M REALLY
STARTING TO FEEL LIKE--

05:54.054 --> 05:56.657
( beep )

05:56.690 --> 05:58.158
LOOKS GOOD.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.828
JUST DON'T SIT COACH FULTON
ANYWHERE NEAR MR. DONOVAN.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.769
I'M GONNA WALK
AROUND TOWN LATER,

06:08.802 --> 06:09.903
TRY TO GET STORE OWNERS

06:09.937 --> 06:11.071
TO BUY SOME ADS
FOR THE PROGRAM.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.706
YOU WANNA COME?

06:12.740 --> 06:15.709
I'M NOT REALLY GOOD AT
ASKING PEOPLE FOR MONEY.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.011
PLEASE, YOU'RE
THE STAR OF THE TEAM.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.548
WHO COULD POSSIBLY
TURN YOU DOWN?

06:22.015 --> 06:25.986
BESIDES, NOW THAT
THE SEASON'S OVER,

06:26.019 --> 06:27.555
WHAT ELSE
DO YOU HAVE TO DO?

06:28.689 --> 06:31.992
ALL RIGHT. COUNT ME IN.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.462
COOL.

06:34.495 --> 06:37.465
SO, I KNOW WE'RE BOTH
VIOLENTLY OPPOSED
TO POLY BLENDS,

06:37.498 --> 06:40.167
BUT THIS...
MADE ME A BELIEVER.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.769
IT'S CUTE.

06:41.802 --> 06:45.573
CUTE? MITTENS ARE CUTE.
THIS IS FABULOUS.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.040
AND THIS...

06:47.074 --> 06:49.109
COST MORE THAN
MY MOTHER'S CAR,
BUT, HELLO!

06:49.142 --> 06:50.878
RAW SILK,
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.212
YEAH, THEY'RE BOTH CUTE.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.882
WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT THAT WORD?

06:54.915 --> 06:57.017
DID I CATCH YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF A NAP?

06:57.050 --> 06:59.587
( cellphone chiming )

07:03.724 --> 07:06.627
THIS IS GETTING
REALLY BORING.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.628
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.898
I'M GETTING TEXTS
FROM THAT SAME FREAK

07:10.931 --> 07:13.000
WHO SENT ME THE ONE
ABOUT YOUR LIPOSUCTION.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.902
WHAT?

07:14.935 --> 07:17.671
WAIT, MONA, WHEN DID THIS
START HAPPENING AGAIN?

07:17.705 --> 07:19.106
FEW DAYS AGO.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.576
IT'S SO CREEPY-- LIKE
I'M BEING WATCHED 24/7.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.244
WHAT DO THE TEXTS SAY?

07:24.277 --> 07:27.247
FIRST IT WAS DUMB STUFF--
ACCUSING ME OF STEALING
THIS NECKLACE.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.716
DID YOU?

07:28.749 --> 07:31.118
D'UH! YES! BUT WHY
IS IT THEIR BUSINESS?

07:31.151 --> 07:33.186
LIKE I'M GONNA BE
SCARED INTO RETURNING
IT. GUESS AGAIN.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.790
MAYBE YOU SHOULD RETURN IT.
FINE.

07:36.824 --> 07:40.761
THEN YOU HAVE TO RETURN
HALF THE THINGS IN
THAT CLOSET.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.099
MONA, ARE THERE TEXTS
ABOUT ME TOO?

07:46.133 --> 07:50.170
MORE ABOUT YOUR MOM.
READY FOR THIS ONE?

07:51.972 --> 07:53.974
THIS "A" CREEP
EXPECTS ME TO BELIEVE

07:54.007 --> 07:56.777
THAT YOUR MOM
SLEPT WITH THIS GOON
TO SAVE YOUR ASS.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.980
( scoffs ) OKAY, NO, MONA,
THIS IS TOTALLY PHOTOSHOPPED.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.582
I FIGURED.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.917
PEOPLE HAVE WAY TOO MUCH
TIME ON THEIR HANDS.

08:03.951 --> 08:08.055
DOES THIS "A" PERSON
WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING
WITH THAT PICTURE?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.923
NO.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.593
WHAT IF HE OR SHE
STARTS THREATENING YOU?

08:12.626 --> 08:13.861
OH, PLEASE.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.863
IF I COULD LIVE THROUGH
ALISON DiLAURENTIS

08:15.896 --> 08:17.698
AND HER NONSTOP TORTURE,

08:17.731 --> 08:20.100
I CAN HANDLE SOME
RADIOACTIVE TEXTING.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.642
SCREW IT! I'M GOING
WITH THE RAW SILK.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.854
WHAT TIME IS IT?

08:40.888 --> 08:42.890
5:58.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.862
OKAY, WHAT TIME IS IT NOW?

08:48.896 --> 08:51.599
ARIA, IT'S STILL 5:58.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.133
HE'S COMING.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.641
WHO'S THIS?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.009
I'M THE MONEY.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.113
SHE IS. SHE'S THE MONEY.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.281
SO WHERE IS IT?

09:08.315 --> 09:11.084
UNH-UNH. NOT UNTIL YOU
HAND OVER THE INFO.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.086
NO WAY. I'VE ALREADY
BEEN BURNED ONCE.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.788
IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.996
HERE.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.070
HEAR FROM VIVIAN YET?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.842
YOU DON'T OWE ME ANSWERS...

09:34.875 --> 09:36.309
BUT SHE DOES.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.649
THIS IS IT.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.223
HEY, WAIT! NO! WHOA!
WAIT!

09:50.257 --> 09:52.359
THERE'S NO NAME.
THERE'S NO NUMBER.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.662
THIS IS JUST AN ADDRESS.
WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?

09:54.662 --> 09:56.096
THE TEXT CAME
FROM A BURNER PHONE.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.998
I WAS ONLY ABLE
TO TRACE THE LOCATION.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.399
I-I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.969
THAT'S ALL I GAVE VIVIAN.
SHE WAS HAPPY WITH IT.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.404
WE'RE NOT, OKAY?
YOU NEED TO GIVE ME
BACK HALF THE MONEY

10:04.437 --> 10:06.006
'CAUSE WE ONLY GOT
HALF THE INFORMATION.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.841
THAT WAS THE MONEY
THAT WAS OWED TO ME.

10:07.875 --> 10:11.679
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT,
YOU GOT THE ADDRESS FOR FREE.

10:11.712 --> 10:12.980
( indistinct complaint )

10:14.882 --> 10:17.050
AT LEAST WE GOT SOMETHING.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.686
( scoffs )

10:25.893 --> 10:27.828
IT'S 20 MINUTES FROM HERE.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.370
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
HE'S BEEN THERE FOR?

10:37.404 --> 10:40.040
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
WE'RE GOING TO THAT
ADDRESS RIGHT NOW.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.281
( cellphone plinks )

10:53.320 --> 10:55.288
( sighs )

11:03.130 --> 11:06.133
HEY. NEED HELP WITH DINNER?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.968
SURE. GRAB A BOX
OF PASTA?

11:11.304 --> 11:13.206
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD,

11:13.240 --> 11:15.342
THE WAY THAT WILDEN
STOPPED BY TODAY.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.112
TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.481
IT REMINDED ME OF WHEN...

11:21.514 --> 11:23.751
YOU KNOW.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.019
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
TO NEVER TALK ABOUT
THAT AGAIN.

11:26.053 --> 11:29.857
NO, I-I KNOW.
I JUST... COULDN'T HELP
BUT THINK ABOUT IT TODAY.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.292
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

11:32.325 --> 11:33.861
IF PEOPLE EVER FOUND OUT.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.000
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

11:40.033 --> 11:42.803
DID HE CALL HERE
TODAY AFTER HE LEFT?

11:42.836 --> 11:44.938
DID HE SAY SOMETHING TO YOU?
NO.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.075
IF IT DID GET OUT...

11:48.108 --> 11:50.077
HANNA, PLEASE.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.979
...COULD YOU LOSE YOUR JOB?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.418
I COULD LOSE YOU.

11:58.451 --> 12:02.222
IF YOUR FATHER DECIDED
TO SUE FOR CUSTODY,

12:02.255 --> 12:04.958
THIS WOULD BE ALL
HE WOULD NEED TO GET IT.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.862
WHAT TIME IS YOUR INTERVIEW?

12:08.896 --> 12:11.031
UH, I'M...
HEADING IN THERE NOW.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.000
OKAY. WELL, CAN I
 SEE YOU TOMORROW?

12:13.033 --> 12:14.134
MY FLIGHT GETS IN AT NOON.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.502
I'LL JUST CALL YOU
WHEN I GET IN.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.171
HEY, MAYBE WE CAN...
( soft knock at door )

12:18.205 --> 12:20.307
( laughing )
YEAH. OKAY, EM.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.942
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
 ALL RIGHT.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.311
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. BYE.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.147
WHAT'S UP?
HOW WAS SCHOOL?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.082
IT WAS FINE.

12:29.116 --> 12:32.052
LOOK, I KNOW THINGS
HAVE BEEN TENSE BETWEEN
YOU AND YOUR DAD LATELY,

12:32.085 --> 12:35.222
BUT, UM, THERE ARE
OTHER REASONS WHY
HE'S SO WORRIED.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.890
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:37.991 --> 12:40.093
SOMEBODY LEFT THIS ON HIS CAR.

12:42.963 --> 12:46.033
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO SENT IT?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.002
NO.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.207
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN YOU WOULD SHARE

12:54.241 --> 12:56.143
EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON
IN YOUR LIFE WITH ME,

12:56.176 --> 12:57.878
AND WHO WAS IN YOUR LIFE.

12:57.911 --> 13:01.581
MOM! COME ON,
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY
THAT'S IN MY LIFE.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.085
DO YOU THINK EZRA
WOULD KNOW SOMEONE
WHO WOULD WANT TO--?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.153
NO.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.357
DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT LETTER I GOT LAST YEAR,

13:10.390 --> 13:12.325
ABOUT DAD'S AFFAIR
WITH MEREDITH?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.329
IT WAS SIGNED BY "A" TOO.

13:16.363 --> 13:19.499
I HAD JUST ASSUMED
THAT MEREDITH WROTE IT,

13:19.532 --> 13:21.068
BUT NOW...

13:23.470 --> 13:24.571
DON'T WORRY.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.573
YOUR DAD AND I
WILL LOOK INTO IT.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.613
( laughter )

13:33.646 --> 13:36.116
FIDDLER'S CAFE,
A HUNDRED.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.351
BENNY AND EDDIE'S PIZZA,
FIFTY.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.953
WE MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.889
( cellphone rings )

13:44.157 --> 13:45.625
HEY, MOM.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.228
I'M STILL AT SCHOOL,
JUST FINISHING UP
WITH EMILY.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.265
NO, MOM,
SHE'S JUST A FRIEND.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.902
I'LL BE HOME IN AN HOUR.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.403
'KAY.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.938
"JUST A FRIEND"?

14:00.307 --> 14:01.608
I CAME OUT TO MY PARENTS.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.010
YOU DID?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.113
HOW DID THEY TAKE IT?

14:06.146 --> 14:08.048
THEY FREAKED OUT,
A LITTLE.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.450
SOME TEARS,
SOME SCREAMING, BUT...

14:10.483 --> 14:12.319
NOTHING LIKE
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.255
WOW. THAT'S SO GREAT.
I MEAN...

14:15.288 --> 14:17.457
NOT THE SCREAMING PART,
BUT...

14:17.490 --> 14:18.558
GREAT.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.931
I HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR IT.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.032
ME?

14:25.065 --> 14:27.100
WHAT DID I DO?

14:27.134 --> 14:30.570
YOU HANDLED
COMING OUT SO WELL,

14:30.603 --> 14:33.073
JUST MADE IT SEEM POSSIBLE
FOR ME TO DO IT TOO.

14:33.106 --> 14:36.109
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
I DO.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.410
I'VE WATCHED YOU.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.184
THANKS.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.319
I'M GLAD YOU WERE ABLE
TO TALK TO YOUR PARENTS.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.420
ME TOO.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.024
I JUST...

14:51.058 --> 14:52.659
WISH I'D DONE IT SOONER.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.462
( cellphone plinks )

14:55.495 --> 14:56.964
UM...

15:01.534 --> 15:04.337
UM, I'M SORRY.
I GOTTA GO.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.638
IS THAT MAYA?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.074
NO.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.177
Here.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.981
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.016
Thanks.

15:18.285 --> 15:21.621
SO... THAT'S WHY YOU
WERE NEVER CHARGED
WITH SHOPLIFTING?

15:21.654 --> 15:25.125
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
PLEASE, NO JOKES,
NO JUDGING.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.261
ALL OF THIS WAS OVER
A PAIR OF DESIGNER
SUNGLASSES.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.230
I'M SORRY, I'M JUST
STILL PROCESSING.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.499
GOD, IF MY MOM KNEW
THAT I TOLD YOU GUYS THIS--

15:32.532 --> 15:34.234
WE'D NEVER JUDGE HER!

15:34.267 --> 15:36.236
SHE TOOK ME IN.
SHE'S AMAZING.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.171
MY MOM WOULD HAVE DRIVEN
ME TO THE STATION

15:38.205 --> 15:39.606
AND OFFERED
TO TAKE THE MUG SHOT.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.241
THE REAL QUESTION IS,
WHY IS "A" SUDDENLY

15:41.274 --> 15:43.076
GOING AFTER MONA?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.744
WHAT, WE'RE NOT ENOUGH?

15:44.777 --> 15:48.015
"A" KNOWS WE'RE
GETTING CLOSER.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.649
THEY CAN'T TURN US
AGAINST EACH OTHER,

15:49.682 --> 15:51.484
SO THEY'RE USING
OUR FRIENDS TO HURT US.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.386
HOW MUCH DID YOU
TELL MONA ABOUT "A"?

15:53.420 --> 15:54.554
NOTHING.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.024
I DIDN'T...
SAY ANYTHING.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.558
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.660
WE ALL KNOW WHAT "A's"
CAPABLE OF.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.463
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY THE LESS MONA
KNOWS, THE BETTER.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.265
GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.634
I JUST FEEL BAD
LYING TO HER.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.737
WHERE YOU GOING?

16:10.770 --> 16:12.305
I HAVEN'T EATEN
ANYTHING ALL DAY.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.740
I'M STARTING
TO GET A TWITCH.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.043
WHEN YOU GO DOWN THERE,
COULD YOU LOOK OUTSIDE

16:16.076 --> 16:18.178
AND SEE IF GARRETT'S
CAR IS STILL OUT FRONT?

16:18.211 --> 16:20.180
Yeah.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.215
HE FOLLOWED ME HOME.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.254
"A" SENT MY DAD A LETTER, TRYING
TO GET HIM TO CATCH ME AND EZRA,

16:27.287 --> 16:29.689
AND NOW MY MOM'S ON THE HUNT
TO FIND OUT WHO "A" IS.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.127
WAIT... WHOA...
WAIT. BACK UP.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.229
WHY WOULD "A"
SEND YOUR DAD
A LETTER LIKE THAT

16:36.263 --> 16:37.697
IF YOU WEREN'T
STILL SEEING EZRA?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.299
BECAUSE I AM.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.135
STILL SEEING HIM.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.537
GUESS, I-I'M SORRY, OKAY?
I REALLY WANTED TO TELL YOU.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.673
I JUST... I THOUGHT
IT'D BE DANGEROUS.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.177
WE UNDERSTAND.
NO!

16:50.210 --> 16:52.512
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF!
DIDN'T WE HAVE, LIKE,

16:52.545 --> 16:54.381
MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS
WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT

16:54.414 --> 16:56.249
HOW HEARTBROKEN WE WERE
OVER LOSING TOBY

16:56.283 --> 16:57.250
AND EZRA?!

16:57.284 --> 16:58.585
I didn't...

16:58.618 --> 17:01.121
GOD, YOU DESERVE AN OSCAR
FOR THAT PERFORMANCE.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.825
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
OKAY, BUT IF IT'S
ANY CONSOLATION,

17:05.858 --> 17:07.694
MY DAD IS DOING
EVERYTHING HE CAN
TO MAKE SURE EZRA'S

17:07.727 --> 17:09.529
OUT OF MY LIFE
AND ROSEWOOD FOR GOOD.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.731
Hanna: YOU GUYS!
COME DOWN HERE!

17:17.270 --> 17:19.106
CALEB SENT ME AN E-MAIL.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.241
HE TOLD ME TO OPEN
THE ATTACHMENT IMMEDIATELY.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.375
CAN I DO IT ON YOUR LAPTOP?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.676
YEAH.
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

17:24.711 --> 17:28.715
DID HE CRACK MORE
OF "A's" PHONE?

17:28.748 --> 17:31.318
IF HE DID,
I WANT $2,000 BACK.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.623
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BE LOOKING FOR?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.358
Girl: SHE'S COMING
 UPSTAIRS.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.128
ARE WE ABOUT TO SEE
ALISON GET KILLED?

17:43.630 --> 17:44.831
( all gasping )

17:44.864 --> 17:46.166
WHERE IS SHE?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.567
OH, MY GOD.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.169
IT'S MELISSA!

17:56.776 --> 17:58.445
I AGREE!
YEAH, ME TOO!

17:58.478 --> 17:59.679
NO!

17:59.712 --> 18:01.148
WHY?

18:01.148 --> 18:03.716
I-I NEED TO TALK
TO MELISSA FIRST.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.752
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHAT SHE WAS DOING
IN ALISON'S ROOM.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.354
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

18:07.387 --> 18:08.621
SHE WAS A PART
OF THAT NIGHT.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.223
THEY-- THEY WERE
ALL AFTER ALISON.

18:10.257 --> 18:14.194
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
SHE-- SHE JUST--

18:14.227 --> 18:18.198
SHE COULD HAVE JUST
BEEN LOOKING FOR IAN.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.767
LOOK, OKAY, I KNOW THAT MELISSA
HAD HER ISSUES WITH ALISON,

18:20.800 --> 18:23.236
BUT I'M NOT ABOUT TO TURN IN
MY PREGNANT SISTER.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.604
I WILL.
WATCH ME.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.506
HANNA! YOU JUST ASKED ME
NOT TO BE SO QUICK

18:26.539 --> 18:28.241
TO JUDGE YOUR OWN MOTHER,
AND NOW YOU'RE READY

18:28.275 --> 18:29.809
TO THROW MY SISTER
BEHIND BARS!

18:29.842 --> 18:32.312
SPENCER! MELISSA HAS
LIED TO YOU SO MANY TIMES.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.181
WHY DO YOU THINK SHE'S
GONNA TELL THE TRUTH NOW...

18:34.214 --> 18:37.250
HUH?
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T ALWAYS
BEEN SO HONEST WITH HER EITHER.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.719
BUT MAYBE IF I COME CLEAN
AND I TELL HER WHAT WE SAW...

18:39.752 --> 18:41.788
SHE'LL COME UP
WITH A BIGGER LIE!

18:41.821 --> 18:43.890
NOT IF SHE KNOWS
WHAT'S AT STAKE!

18:47.394 --> 18:51.364
PLEASE, OKAY, JUST...
GIVE ME THIS ONE NIGHT
TO TALK TO HER.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.537
FINE. FINE,
GO TO MELISSA, OKAY,

18:57.570 --> 18:59.672
AND... WE'LL TRY
TO FIGURE OUT

18:59.706 --> 19:01.774
WHERE "A" WAS SENDING
THOSE TEXTS FROM.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.381
SPENCE, TALK TO HER. NOW.

19:20.727 --> 19:24.731
( indistinct chatter
 and music )

19:24.764 --> 19:26.799
( music playing )

19:33.373 --> 19:35.242
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

19:35.242 --> 19:36.743
UH... COFFEE, PLEASE.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.452
YOU LIED TO ME!

19:47.587 --> 19:48.955
MONA, WHERE DID
YOU GET THIS?

19:48.988 --> 19:50.590
ANOTHER GIFT FROM "A."

19:50.623 --> 19:52.825
IT WAS IN MY MAILBOX
WHEN I GOT HOME TODAY.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.862
A POLICE REPORT
FOR SHOPLIFTING? REALLY?

19:55.895 --> 19:58.731
ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

19:58.765 --> 20:02.602
I'M SORRY
I LIED TO YOU, BUT...

20:02.635 --> 20:05.338
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
THAT YOU ADVERTISE.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.607
WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT "A" WANTS ME TO DO.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.941
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:08.975 --> 20:11.744
( sighs ) I HAVE
TO GIVE THE PICTURE

20:11.778 --> 20:13.946
AND THE POLICE REPORT
TO THE ROSEWOOD OBSERVER,

20:13.980 --> 20:16.449
OR I'LL BE FILLING OUT
ONE OF THESE MYSELF.

20:16.483 --> 20:19.018
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOUR MOM,
BUT IF THIS GETS OUT,

20:19.051 --> 20:21.354
THEY COULD PRESS CHARGES
AND I COULD GO TO JAIL,

20:21.388 --> 20:22.855
AND THAT CANNOT HAPPEN.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.597
( music playing )

20:35.635 --> 20:36.836
( sighs )

20:50.082 --> 20:51.651
WELL, I SAY THIS IS FATE,

20:51.684 --> 20:53.353
BUMPING INTO YOU
HERE LIKE THIS.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.923
( chuckles )
YOU DO WORK NEXT DOOR,

20:56.956 --> 20:59.659
AND I LIVE A FEW BLOCKS
DOWN THE ROAD, SO...

20:59.692 --> 21:01.561
I WOULDN'T REALLY
CALL IT FATE.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.929
IT'S JUST A SMALL TOWN.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.833
ARE YOU DRINKING ALONE?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.935
HOPEFULLY NOT ANYMORE.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.937
I WOULD INVITE YOU
TO SIT DOWN, BUT...

21:10.970 --> 21:12.805
MELISSA SHOULD
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.407
PROBABLY
OUT OF THE QUESTION

21:14.441 --> 21:16.042
FOR THE THREE OF US
TO HAVE A MEAL, HUH?

21:16.075 --> 21:17.977
YEAH.
( chuckles )

21:18.010 --> 21:19.346
OH.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.047
Wren: SPEAKING OF.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.750
MELISSA!

21:23.783 --> 21:25.785
( horn honks )

21:31.624 --> 21:32.992
WHAT THE HELL
JUST HAPPENED?

21:33.025 --> 21:34.761
NOT VERY SISTERLY OF HER.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.100
WHY WOULD SHE GET
IN THE CAR WITH GARRETT?

21:41.133 --> 21:42.669
SHE HARDLY EVEN
KNOWS THE GUY.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.771
SHE KNOWS HIM BETTER
THAN YOU THINK.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.407
I SAW HIM WITH
HER AT A DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT LAST WEEK.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.975
THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.377
I WOULDN'T FORGET THAT.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.844
PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY
BRING A GLOCK

21:51.878 --> 21:53.012
TO THE O.B.G.Y.N.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.515
( cellphone plinks )

21:58.885 --> 22:00.553
( scoffs )

22:07.760 --> 22:09.862
MAYBE IT'S JUST
SOME KIND OF SICK JOKE.

22:09.896 --> 22:13.433
NO. TAKE IT FROM ME,
THE THREAT IS REAL.

22:13.466 --> 22:14.801
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:18.771 --> 22:20.907
I'VE GOTTEN TEXTS
FROM "A" BEFORE TOO.

22:20.940 --> 22:21.908
WHAT?

22:21.941 --> 22:23.743
AND SO HAVE MY FRIENDS.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.044
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME SOONER?

22:25.077 --> 22:26.713
BECAUSE THE LESS
YOU KNOW, THE BETTER.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.548
WHAT THE HELL IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

22:28.581 --> 22:30.617
DO YOU KNOW
WHO'S DOING THIS?
NO.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.054
I DON'T, BUT I ALSO KNOW "A"
ISN'T PLAYING AROUND.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.590
WHAT HAS "A" DONE TO YOU?

22:37.624 --> 22:39.926
MONA, IF I
TOLD YOU EVERYTHING,

22:39.959 --> 22:42.028
WE'D BE
HERE TILL GRADUATION.

22:44.797 --> 22:48.000
SO... WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

22:49.802 --> 22:51.003
I DON'T KNOW.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.474
BUT I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, OKAY?

22:56.809 --> 22:58.878
YOU'D BETTER HURRY.

23:06.653 --> 23:09.689
SHE STILL ISN'T ANSWERING.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.525
APPARENTLY WHATEVER SHE HAD
TO TALK TO GARRETT ABOUT

23:12.559 --> 23:14.527
WAS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN TALKING TO ME.

23:14.561 --> 23:15.828
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU A LIFT HOME?

23:17.163 --> 23:19.466
HOME IS THE LAST PLACE
I WANT TO GO.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.779
( sighs )

23:56.235 --> 23:57.704
THIS IS IT.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.677
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE
GONNA GET IN HERE.

24:28.635 --> 24:29.936
NOW WHAT?

24:31.037 --> 24:32.204
LET'S LOOK AROUND.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.646
( both scream )

24:39.679 --> 24:41.614
Emily: ARIA!

24:41.648 --> 24:43.583
( alarm blaring )

24:56.729 --> 24:58.765
THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT "A"!

24:58.798 --> 25:00.266
COME ON, LET'S GO.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.075
YOU REALLY
DODGED A BULLET,

25:09.108 --> 25:11.010
NOT MARRYING
MY SISTER.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.613
I'M SURE SHE'D BE
HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.
I'M SERIOUS.

25:13.646 --> 25:17.216
MY FAMILY IS SO SCREWED UP

25:17.249 --> 25:19.218
THAT DR. PHIL
WOULDN'T EVEN TAKE US ON.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.588
HEY, MY FAMILY
HAS ISSUES TOO.

25:21.588 --> 25:22.889
OH, REALLY?

25:22.922 --> 25:24.624
LIKE WHAT?

25:24.657 --> 25:26.092
( imitates English accent )
DID SOMEBODY...

25:26.125 --> 25:28.728
BUTTER THEIR BREAD
WITH A STEAK KNIFE?

25:28.761 --> 25:30.730
JUST 'CAUSE WE DON'T
PLAY "HIGH-LOW"
AT THE DINNER TABLE

25:30.763 --> 25:33.032
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE
NOT JUST AS SCREWED UP.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.867
AND, FOR THE RECORD,

25:34.901 --> 25:37.303
I'M LOOKING, AND I CAN'T
FIND ANYTHING WRONG.

25:37.336 --> 25:40.907
( chuckles )
I AM PLENTY MESSED UP.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.009
ENLIGHTEN ME.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.644
UH, FOR ONE,

25:44.677 --> 25:49.281
I HAVE AN OBSESSIVE NEED
TO BE THE BEST AT EVERYTHING.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.917
I EVEN HAVE TO WIN AT YOGA.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.919
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
A QUIRK, NOT A FAULT,

25:52.952 --> 25:54.787
AND I HAVE PLENTY
OF THOSE TOO.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.889
LIKE?
LIKE? UM...

25:56.923 --> 25:59.058
ALL RIGHT, I'M A TOUCH
WHAT YOU'D CALL O.C.D.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.328
EVERY BOOK ON
MY BOOKSHELF HAS TO BE
IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER

26:02.361 --> 26:04.030
OR I CAN'T SLEEP.

26:04.063 --> 26:08.067
THEN... WHAT IS ARISTOTLE
DOING ON THE BOTTOM ROW?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.102
( chuckles )

26:10.136 --> 26:12.805
IT'S OKAY.

26:12.839 --> 26:16.643
ARISTOTLE IS
EXACTLY WHERE HE SHOULD BE.

26:26.853 --> 26:28.655
OW.

26:28.688 --> 26:32.959
REMIND ME TO NEVER RUN
BACKWARDS ON A PORCH
EVER AGAIN, PLEASE.

26:32.992 --> 26:36.128
F.W.L. LAW FIRM.
HAVE YOU HEARD OF IT?

26:36.162 --> 26:37.997
NO, IT'S A DEAD END.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.099
I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M GONNA GOOGLE IT.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.834
SO WHAT?

26:41.868 --> 26:43.970
WHAT, "A's" A LAWYER NOW?
GIVE ME A BREAK!

26:44.003 --> 26:46.105
EVERYBODY THAT WORKS HERE
HAS GOT TO BE OVER 30.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.674
FOUND IT.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.843
IT... CLOSED DOWN
THREE MONTHS AGO.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.144
WHERE IS
EMILY WITH OUR FOOD?

26:52.178 --> 26:54.146
I'M SO HUNGRY.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.415
HERE'S A LIST OF EMPLOYEES.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.851
"CHARLES LANG."

26:58.885 --> 27:00.953
ISN'T THAT, UM,
CRYSTAL'S FATHER?

27:00.987 --> 27:03.990
NO. CRYSTAL'S LAST NAME
IS LEE, NOT LANG.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.094
HANNA, FACE IT,
WE GOT SCAMMED.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.697
SO THAT'S IT? "A" WINS?

27:10.730 --> 27:12.932
EITHER MY MOM GOES DOWN
OR MONA DOES.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.102
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.904
( scoffs )

27:17.937 --> 27:20.039
Spencer: I REMEMBER...

27:20.072 --> 27:23.042
THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU,

27:23.075 --> 27:25.878
AND I JUST THOUGHT...

27:25.912 --> 27:27.413
"DAMN."

27:27.446 --> 27:29.716
( chuckles )
JUST... ( chuckles )

27:35.922 --> 27:38.758
SPENCER?
YES?

27:38.791 --> 27:41.293
YOU'RE PISSED.
PISSED?!

27:41.327 --> 27:43.896
SNOCKERED.
( laughs )

27:43.930 --> 27:45.898
I'M SNOCKERED?

27:45.932 --> 27:48.034
DRUNK.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.136
( laughing )
TOTALLY!

27:52.271 --> 27:55.141
I AM... SMASHED!

28:00.479 --> 28:01.948
WHAT?

28:01.981 --> 28:04.917
THOUGHT YOU WERE
REALLY INTO ME.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.185
I AM.

28:06.218 --> 28:09.188
VERY MUCH SO.

28:09.221 --> 28:12.892
AND THAT'S WHY I CAN'T.
NOT LIKE THIS.

28:16.796 --> 28:17.897
NOPE.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.332
( laughing )
( laughing )

28:20.366 --> 28:22.301
THANKS.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.276
MAYA?

28:30.309 --> 28:33.445
MAYA, IS THAT YOU?

28:35.014 --> 28:37.784
SORRY, I...
THOUGHT YOU WERE
SOMEONE ELSE.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.229
OHH! EMILY!

28:50.262 --> 28:52.098
HEY.
HI!

28:52.131 --> 28:53.365
HEY.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.802
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I'M FINE.

28:55.802 --> 28:58.504
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.472
WHAT'S WRONG?
EM, TALK TO ME.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.245
MAYA AND I GOT
IN A FIGHT THE OTHER
NIGHT AT THE PARTY,

29:06.278 --> 29:09.949
AND I HAVEN'T
TALKED TO HER SINCE.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.851
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S
BREAKING UP WITH ME

29:11.884 --> 29:13.920
OR... IF SHE WANTS
TO WORK IT OUT.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.257
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,
'CAUSE SHE WON'T
CALL ME BACK.

29:21.027 --> 29:23.262
DON'T YOU SEE, EM?

29:23.295 --> 29:25.264
THIS IS WHO SHE IS.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.034
WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH,
SHE BAILS.

29:28.067 --> 29:30.502
I KNOW YOU REALLY
CARE ABOUT HER,

29:30.536 --> 29:35.507
BUT... WHAT YOU
REALLY NEED IS SOMEONE
YOU CAN COUNT ON.

29:37.476 --> 29:38.845
THANKS.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.454
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:48.487 --> 29:52.258
I...
NO, I-I'M SORRY IF
I MADE YOU THINK--

29:52.291 --> 29:56.095
NO, I'M... I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.263
EM.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.139
( sighs )

30:23.489 --> 30:24.991
( indistinct remark )

30:25.024 --> 30:26.258
HEY.

30:26.292 --> 30:27.526
HEY.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.228
I KNOW IT'S
PAST THE DEADLINE.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.330
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
FIGURE THINGS OUT,

30:31.363 --> 30:33.599
BUT... LOOK, I JUST
WANT TO LET YOU KNOW

30:33.632 --> 30:36.335
THAT I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.537
I WENT TO THE JEWELRY
STORE THIS MORNING.

30:38.570 --> 30:41.040
YOU DID? WHY?

30:41.073 --> 30:43.075
TO BRING BACK THE NECKLACE.

30:43.109 --> 30:47.046
WHAT'D THEY SAY?
UM, THANKS, AND...

30:47.079 --> 30:49.015
HAVE A SEAT WHILE WE
CALL THE POLICE.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.083
MONA...

30:51.117 --> 30:52.218
I KNOW.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.021
AND I OFFERED
TO WORK IT OFF,

30:55.054 --> 30:57.890
BUT INSTEAD, THEY
CONTACTED MY MOM.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.625
WE MADE A DEAL.

30:59.658 --> 31:03.262
LOOKS LIKE I'LL
BE SERVING SLOP
TO THE HOMELESS.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.664
GOD, MONA,
I AM SO SORRY.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.967
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.971
WHAT WAS I GONNA DO,
HURT MY BEST FRIEND
AND HER MOM?

31:18.677 --> 31:21.948
ALL I KNOW IS,
THEY'D BETTER NOT
MAKE ME WEAR A HAIRNET.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.528
ARE YOU GOING TO WORK?

31:36.562 --> 31:40.099
NOPE. JUST FINISHED
MY ROUNDS.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.101
WHAT?

31:42.134 --> 31:43.369
WAIT, WHAT TIME IS IT?

31:43.402 --> 31:45.171
10:30.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.673
OHH! I'M LATE FOR SCHOOL.

31:49.575 --> 31:52.544
I'M... REALLY SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.113
UM...

31:55.181 --> 31:57.116
( coughs )

31:57.149 --> 31:58.650
I NEVER MEANT
TO IMPOSE ON YOU.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.386
YOU WEREN'T IMPOSING.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.688
I'M SURE I SAID OR DID
SOMETHING STUPID.

32:02.721 --> 32:05.691
OTHER THAN A BIT OF DROOL
ON MY FAVORITE PILLOW,
YOU WERE FINE.

32:05.724 --> 32:08.627
YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY
ON MY COUCH ANY TIME.

32:08.660 --> 32:11.497
JUDGING FROM THE WAY
THINGS ARE GOING AT HOME,

32:11.530 --> 32:13.432
I MIGHT ACTUALLY
TAKE YOU UP ON THAT.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.237
I HOPE YOU DO.

32:33.485 --> 32:34.653
I'LL CALL YOU.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.698
HEY. HAVE YOU
HEARD FROM EZRA?

32:46.732 --> 32:48.667
YEAH, HIS PLANE
LANDS IN AN HOUR.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.155
EVERYTHING OKAY?

33:17.529 --> 33:18.764
MONA, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

33:18.797 --> 33:20.466
I'LL TAKE THE REST
OF THE DAY OFF.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.701
I'M NOT GONNA BE
A SITTING TARGET.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.106
JUST COME EAT WITH US.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.578
I'M NOT SURE YOUR FRIENDS--
TRUST ME.

33:32.611 --> 33:33.779
THEY'RE COOL.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.082
COME ON.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.216
OKAY.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.724
Emily: HEY, MONA.
HOW'S IT GOING?

33:52.564 --> 33:54.500
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.169
NICE TO SEE YOU TOO, ASHLEY.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.205
DID YOU REALLY THINK
YOU COULD INTIMIDATE
MY DAUGHTER

33:59.238 --> 34:01.573
INTO CONFESSING TO A CRIME
SHE DIDN'T COMMIT?

34:01.607 --> 34:05.277
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

34:05.311 --> 34:06.378
REALLY?

34:07.513 --> 34:09.415
WHAT'S THIS?

34:16.222 --> 34:18.424
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

34:18.456 --> 34:20.126
FOUND IT IN HANNA'S THINGS.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.802
Ashley...

34:30.835 --> 34:33.405
why would I
give this to Hanna?

34:33.438 --> 34:35.607
If this came out,
I could lose my job.

34:35.641 --> 34:38.777
Well, if you didn't,
who did?

34:42.547 --> 34:45.217
HEY. IT'S ME AGAIN.

34:46.885 --> 34:50.456
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M NOT ANGRY,

34:50.489 --> 34:52.858
I'M JUST CONFUSED,

34:52.891 --> 34:54.793
AND I MISS YOU LIKE CRAZY.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.664
PLEASE CALL ME BACK.

35:00.499 --> 35:01.667
I LOVE YOU, MAYA.

35:05.604 --> 35:09.375
I'M SO SORRY MY DAD
MADE YOU GO ALL THE WAY
DOWN THERE TO DO THAT.

35:09.408 --> 35:11.343
WELL, IT WASN'T
 THAT BAD.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.512
ACTUALLY,
I LIKE THE CAMPUS
AND THE PROFESSORS.

35:13.545 --> 35:14.880
YEAH, WELL.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.483
I'M JUST GLAD
IT'S ALL OVER WITH.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.751
IT'S NOT. OVER.

35:21.253 --> 35:22.788
THEY OFFERED ME THE JOB.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.790
THEY DID?
MM-HMM.

35:24.823 --> 35:27.759
OBVIOUSLY.
OF COURSE THEY DID.
THEY'D BE CRAZY NOT TO.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.695
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

35:29.728 --> 35:32.798
UH... I HAVEN'T
GIVEN THEM AN ANSWER YET.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.902
YET?

35:38.670 --> 35:41.240
ARIA, YOUR DAD
IS CLEARLY ONTO US.

35:41.273 --> 35:43.375
HE SHOWED UP
AT THE RESTAURANT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

35:43.409 --> 35:46.245
WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE
HE'S SUSPICIOUS,

35:46.278 --> 35:48.214
BUT HE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY PROOF.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.316
THIS JOB IS AN INCREDIBLE
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME,

35:50.349 --> 35:52.918
AND IF I DON'T TAKE IT,
HE WILL KNOW WHAT'S
KEEPING ME HERE.

35:52.951 --> 35:55.454
WE'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY
AROUND IT, LIKE WE
ALWAYS DO.

35:57.223 --> 36:00.559
I USED TO THINK THAT,
AND I'M NOT SO SURE
ANYMORE.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.599
WHAT ARE YOU...

36:07.633 --> 36:09.801
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
ARE YOU...

36:09.835 --> 36:13.405
GIVING UP ON US?
NO. NO, NO.

36:15.274 --> 36:18.344
BUT WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO MAKE THIS WORK
FOR A LONG TIME,

36:18.377 --> 36:20.346
AND...
AND WHAT?! WHAT?!

36:20.379 --> 36:22.248
AND-- AND AS MUCH
AS WE LOVE EACH OTHER,

36:22.281 --> 36:25.384
I THINK WE ARE DELUDING
OURSELVES INTO BELIEVING
THAT IT CAN.

36:28.487 --> 36:32.858
Female Vocalist:
 * ...FALLING IN LOVE

36:32.891 --> 36:35.261

37:30.782 --> 37:32.017
HONEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

37:32.050 --> 37:33.752
GO AWAY.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.020
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN--?

37:35.053 --> 37:37.055
MOM, GO AWAY. PLEASE.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.790
NO, I'M NOT
GONNA GO ANYWHERE

37:38.824 --> 37:41.593
UNTIL YOU TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE SO UPSET.

37:41.627 --> 37:42.694
FINE.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.864
EZRA'S LEAVING,
SO DAD GOT HIS WISH.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.333
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

37:49.435 --> 37:51.036
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:51.069 --> 37:53.472
HE'S TAKING THAT JOB
IN NEW ORLEANS.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.875
WHAT JOB?
THE JOB THAT DAD
SET HIM UP WITH.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.578
( sighs )
WHEN DID HE DO THIS?

37:59.611 --> 38:01.980
DON'T PRETEND LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW, MOM.

38:02.013 --> 38:04.783
YOU MAY HAVE GOTTEN RID
OF EZRA, BUT GUESS WHAT--

38:04.816 --> 38:06.518
YOU LOST ME TOO.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.465
DO YOU WANT ME TO HEAT
THAT UP FOR YOU?

38:19.498 --> 38:20.632
I'M NOT REALLY HUNGRY.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.037
YOU GONNA BOTHER
UNPACKING IT?

38:26.071 --> 38:28.073
ARIA.
NO.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.675
I MEAN, HOW SOON DO THEY
WANT YOU DOWN THERE?

38:29.708 --> 38:31.109
IF IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF A FEW DAYS--

38:31.142 --> 38:33.779
I'M NOT LEAVING RIGHT AWAY.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.649
IT ALREADY FEELS
LIKE YOU HAVE.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.919
( knock on door )

38:48.126 --> 38:49.395
WHOA.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.636
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

38:57.669 --> 38:59.070
DID YOU FOLLOW ME
OVER HERE WITH HANDCUFFS,

38:59.104 --> 39:00.972
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA
YANK ME UP BY MY HAIR?

39:01.006 --> 39:03.842
I'M NOT HERE
TO BRING YOU HOME.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.911
I CAME TO LISTEN.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.024
( indistinct noise )

39:19.057 --> 39:21.026
MOM, IS THAT YOU?

39:22.528 --> 39:23.695
DAD?

39:28.600 --> 39:29.835
IT'S JUST ME.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.505
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

39:33.539 --> 39:35.807
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL YOU
FOR THE PAST 12 HOURS.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.543
IT'S A LONG STORY.

39:37.576 --> 39:38.977
I KNOW THAT YOU LIED TO ME.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.812
I SAW YOU GET INTO
THE CAR WITH GARRETT.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.549
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING,
BUT JUST NOT HERE.

39:43.582 --> 39:46.084
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE MOM AND DAD
WILL BE HOME ANY MINUTE...

39:46.117 --> 39:48.720
AND I CAN'T SAY
WHAT I NEED TO SAY
IN FRONT OF THEM.

39:48.754 --> 39:51.890
WELL, WHAT DO YOU NEED
TO SAY THAT YOU CAN'T SAY
IN FRONT OF MOM AND DAD?

39:54.092 --> 39:56.027
DO YOU REMEMBER THE NIGHT
OF IAN'S FUNERAL,

39:56.061 --> 39:57.963
WHEN I TRIED
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING?

39:57.996 --> 39:59.731
WELL, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IT NOW.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.104
ARE YOU COMING OR NOT?

40:07.806 --> 40:10.175
YEAH.

40:10.208 --> 40:11.577
OKAY.

40:27.693 --> 40:30.228
DO YOU TAKE
MILK IN YOUR TEA?

40:30.261 --> 40:32.030
NO.

40:32.063 --> 40:34.633
OKAY, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE DOING HERE?

40:34.666 --> 40:36.535
'CAUSE I-I REALLY DON'T
FEEL LIKE HAVING

40:36.568 --> 40:38.504
A TEA PARTY
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

40:38.537 --> 40:42.541
WELL, THIS IS NOT EXACTLY
HOW I PLANNED TO SPEND
MY EVENING EITHER.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.878
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR:

40:46.912 --> 40:49.681
I DON'T CONDONE
THIS RELATIONSHIP,

40:49.715 --> 40:51.817
BUT I'M ALSO AFRAID
OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN

40:51.850 --> 40:54.820
IF I TAKE THE SAME
STANCE AS MY HUSBAND.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.923
SORRY, SO WHERE DOES
THAT LEAVE US?

40:59.257 --> 41:01.226
I WANT TO SLOW THINGS DOWN.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.962
BEFORE ANYBODY
GOES MOVING AWAY

41:03.995 --> 41:07.566
OR RUNNING AWAY...
( draws deep breath )

41:07.599 --> 41:11.637
...I WANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS IS.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.611
( tea kettle whistles )

41:19.645 --> 41:21.947
( clears throat )
EXCUSE ME.

41:34.893 --> 41:37.262
NICE TO SEE YOU
CLEANING YOUR ROOM.

41:37.295 --> 41:39.030
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

41:39.064 --> 41:41.232
I THOUGHT WE WERE
EATING DINNER AN HOUR AGO.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.701
SORRY.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.603
MY BOARD MEETING RAN LATE.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.207
I LEFT YOU SOME THAI
TAKEOUT IN THE KITCHEN.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.842
HANG THESE UP?

42:03.955 --> 42:05.290
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

42:05.323 --> 42:08.226
IT CAME IN THE MAIL
BY MISTAKE.

42:08.259 --> 42:11.162
THAT'S... ODD.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.765
IT'S ADDRESSED TO THE FIRM
I USED FOR THE DIVORCE.

42:13.799 --> 42:17.235
YOU USED F.W.L. LAW FIRM?
YEAH.

42:17.268 --> 42:20.639
WHY WOULD YOU PICK
A FIRM ALL THE WAY
OVER IN WALLINGFORD?

42:20.672 --> 42:23.141
DID YOU KNOW SOMEONE
WHO WORKED THERE?

42:23.174 --> 42:24.710
YEAH. MELISSA HASTINGS.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.277
SPENCER'S SISTER?

42:26.311 --> 42:28.046
SHE WAS AN INTERN
THERE THAT SUMMER.

42:30.115 --> 42:32.283
( doorbell rings )

42:34.219 --> 42:36.187
EMILY FIELDS?

42:36.221 --> 42:38.323
YES.
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

42:38.356 --> 42:39.791
ABOUT WHAT?

42:39.825 --> 42:41.627
MAYA ST. GERMAIN.
