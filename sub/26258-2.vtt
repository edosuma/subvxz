WEBVTT

00:09.343 --> 00:10.761
Ba-bum.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.347
[croaks]

00:14.640 --> 00:15.933
[panting]

00:17.684 --> 00:19.686
[Callum]
<i>Previously on </i>The Dragon Prince...

00:20.854 --> 00:24.983
Assassins. A scout on patrol
discovered them just before dawn.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.070
We believe they’re Moonshadow elves.

00:28.654 --> 00:33.242
The humans crossed into Xadia
and murdered the King of the Dragons.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.578
Then they destroyed his only egg,
the Dragon Prince.

00:36.662 --> 00:40.415
Tonight, we bind our lives to justice.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.626
[laughing]

00:42.709 --> 00:44.419
Ezran, you don’t get it, do you?

00:44.503 --> 00:48.090
Why do you think they’re sending us away?
Because they’re coming to kill him.

00:50.676 --> 00:53.887
[Rayla] <i>The human, he looked up at me</i>
<i>and I saw the fear in his eyes. </i>

00:53.971 --> 00:56.890
[Runaan] <i>You let him live,</i>
<i>but you’ve killed us all.</i>

00:58.100 --> 01:00.102
[theme music playing]

01:15.284 --> 01:16.827
[roaring]

01:44.438 --> 01:46.356
They’ll be on the lookout for us now.

01:47.399 --> 01:50.944
Five of us won’t be enough.
We need all six.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.698
We’ll be stronger as five.

02:23.185 --> 02:27.230
Hey, could I borrow
your sharpener thingie?

02:29.358 --> 02:30.651
Whetstone.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.152
Yeah, that.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.987
No.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.665
Come with me.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.471
Ezran, I’m sorry.
I shouldn’t have said what I said.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.807
I’m sure everything’s going to be fine.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.226
Come on.
Later, you can call me a jerkface,

03:04.309 --> 03:06.853
and I’ll do
the crazy jerkface dance for you.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.564
It is a dance of stupitude and sorry-ness.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.985
Okay, well, I’m going to go grab
some books for our trip.

03:14.486 --> 03:17.823
We don’t have much time,
so I’ll be back to help you pack in a few.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.875
I thought you could do it, Rayla,
but I was wrong.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.294
You’re not wrong. I can do it.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.380
I know you’ve never taken before.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.424
I brought you because you’re talented.

03:35.507 --> 03:38.677
Maybe the fastest and strongest
of any of us.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.846
But it takes more than that.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.432
There’s an instinct. A moment of truth.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.560
And in that moment, you hesitate.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.813
-I won’t hesitate again.
-You will.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.065
I see now that you’re still just a child.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.069
Your heart isn’t hard enough
to do whatever it takes.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.697
I messed up. I know I did.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.575
Because I let that human go,
we’re all in danger.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.910
But that’s why
you have to let me make it right.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.620
No, it’s too late for that.

04:05.704 --> 04:09.124
I bound myself, my heart for--

04:10.459 --> 04:15.088
You’ll be unbound when the job is done.
Your role now is to stay out of the way.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.841
You will wait here, quietly.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.181
If we’re not back by sunrise, go home.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.406
I can fix this.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.019
[gasps]

05:15.524 --> 05:17.442
[gasps] How in the...

05:17.526 --> 05:19.528
[giggling]

05:21.029 --> 05:21.905
[Claudia] Aspiro.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.369
[giggling]

05:27.452 --> 05:29.996
I thought the book was haunted
or something.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.707
You should have seen
the look on your face.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.418
-It was completely adorable.
-Ridiculous.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.921
Did you just say adorable?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.214
Did I?

05:40.799 --> 05:43.301
[clears throat] It's so amazing
that you can do things like that.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.596
Nah, it's just a simple wind breath rune.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.765
Aspiro.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.561
Can you smell the peanut butter?

05:52.644 --> 05:55.188
Oh, yeah. Is that part of the spell?

05:55.272 --> 05:57.148
Nope, it's just what I had for lunch.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.567
[both laugh]

05:59.359 --> 06:01.820
See this? It's a primal stone.

06:02.404 --> 06:06.283
It uses magical energy
from one of the six primal sources.

06:06.866 --> 06:10.328
-Look.
-Wow. What's inside?

06:10.912 --> 06:17.127
[Claudia] It's a storm, a real storm.
Captured from the top of Mount Kalik.

06:17.794 --> 06:21.089
That's incredible.
You're so lucky you get to learn magic.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.258
Well, you get to learn sword-fighting.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.884
I'd switch places in a second.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.471
[gasps and exclaims excitedly]

06:39.190 --> 06:40.984
I do not understand girls.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.202
My king, we have not been able
to find the elves.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.123
Sundown is only an hour away.

06:55.206 --> 06:59.169
Soren and the others have returned
to bolster your defenses.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.171
It won't be enough.

07:01.671 --> 07:06.092
I've accepted that tonight,
I may pay the price for our mistakes.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.846
Harrow, don't give up just yet.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.434
Claudia and I are still searching
for a creative solution.

07:15.018 --> 07:19.272
Call it what it is... dark magic.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.150
Yes.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.236
I've spent years going along
with these "creative solutions,"

07:25.320 --> 07:26.780
and where has it gotten me?

07:26.863 --> 07:28.573
I don't understand.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.160
I know you don't. Leave me.

07:48.843 --> 07:49.928
[exclaims excitedly]

07:50.011 --> 07:53.431
[sighs] Okay, what is that,
with the nose, the finger?

07:53.515 --> 07:56.017
Not everyone speaks Claudia, Claudia.

07:56.101 --> 07:59.604
It means, I've got something.

08:02.649 --> 08:06.152
Ezran, we need to get going.
It's almost sundown.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.488
Ez?

08:14.828 --> 08:15.787
Oh, no.

08:15.870 --> 08:19.541
-Prince Callum.
-Ow! Uh... [chuckles]

08:19.624 --> 08:22.043
Of course we're both here.
Why wouldn't we be?

08:22.544 --> 08:26.256
Right. Well, the king wants
to see you alone, Prince Callum.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.801
Oh, perfect. But he could have seen
both of us if he wanted to.

08:40.979 --> 08:44.399
Yesterday, I had two eggs
for breakfast and I was starving.

08:44.482 --> 08:48.069
Today, I had four eggs and I'm stuffed.
So, tomorrow--

08:48.153 --> 08:51.239
Three eggs, I get it.
We don't need to talk.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.409
[guard 1] I was going to say
two eggs and one sausage.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.022
[exhales sharply]

09:29.694 --> 09:31.696
[grunting]

09:40.955 --> 09:42.332
[grunting]

09:47.337 --> 09:48.588
[yelps]

09:52.717 --> 09:54.552
[grunting]

10:14.030 --> 10:15.323
You wanted to see me?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.169
[Harrow] Prince Callum.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.841
-My king.
-No, I... Please.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.343
Okay.

10:36.386 --> 10:41.808
Callum, I know I'm not your birth father,
but I want you to know that...

10:42.725 --> 10:45.770
[breathes deeply] This isn't easy.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.482
So, the most important things,
I've written down.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.360
A letter?

10:54.821 --> 10:56.698
[Harrow] You'll understand in time.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.534
I want you to break the seal when...

11:00.660 --> 11:03.413
Well, you'll know when.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.790
When you've been killed.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.585
War is full of uncertainty.

11:08.668 --> 11:13.047
Why can't you do something about it?
Can't you just make peace with them?

11:13.631 --> 11:15.174
It's not that simple.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.469
It seems pretty simple to me.
You don't want to die.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.471
I'm sure the elves and dragons
don't want to die.

11:20.555 --> 11:21.764
So, everyone agrees.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.435
There are centuries of history.

11:25.518 --> 11:30.023
Generations of wrongs and crimes.
On both sides.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.735
I am responsible for some of those wrongs.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.528
I have done terrible things.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.281
I thought they were necessary.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.617
Now, I don't know.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.996
But I do know I will pay the price
for the choices I made.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.749
There has to be a way to make it right.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.958
It's too late.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.462
What is done cannot be undone.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.797
But you're the king. You can do anything.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.216
[Harrow sighs and chuckles]

11:57.300 --> 11:59.344
The great illusion of childhood

11:59.427 --> 12:01.846
is that adults have all the power
and freedom.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.307
But the truth is the opposite.

12:05.850 --> 12:09.187
A child is freer than a king.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.066
I'm going to give this back to you
this weekend, okay?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.943
I'm not going to have to open this.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.445
Take care of your brother.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.822
[Rayla grunting]

13:03.741 --> 13:05.743
[panting]

13:17.046 --> 13:18.673
You're wrong about me.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.427
I can do this.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.805
I will do this.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.657
Ez, is that you?

13:46.117 --> 13:47.201
Hello?

14:14.103 --> 14:16.189
You know you can't sneak up on me.
[exclaims]

14:18.149 --> 14:20.693
Uh, uh, you're not
who I thought you...

14:21.194 --> 14:22.862
You're one of those, with the pointy...

14:22.945 --> 14:24.822
Oh, you don't like my ears?

14:24.906 --> 14:28.785
[stuttering] No. I mean, yeah.
Yes, I do, I guess.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.080
I mean...
I meant the pointy swords.

14:32.163 --> 14:35.666
That's far enough.
I'm looking for someone.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.628
Oh. Uh, did you check back there?

14:40.421 --> 14:41.506
[Rayla yelps]

14:42.006 --> 14:43.007
[Callum panting]

14:43.091 --> 14:43.925
[grunts]

14:57.355 --> 14:58.898
She's right behind me.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.121
-Hey, you swept the leg.
-What?

15:13.204 --> 15:14.414
[stutters] Nothing.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.838
Lord Viren! Claudia! Anyone! [grunts]

15:28.678 --> 15:30.138
You don't have to die.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.853
There are only two targets tonight.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.272
Wait, two? What do you mean?

15:39.355 --> 15:40.982
I'm here for the king.

15:41.065 --> 15:44.068
And I'm also here for his son,
Prince Ezran.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.362
You can't. That's not fair.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.948
Why would you hurt someone
who's done nothing wrong?

15:49.031 --> 15:51.033
Humans cut down the King of the Dragons,

15:51.117 --> 15:54.245
and destroyed his only egg,
the Dragon Prince.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.998
Justice will not be denied.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.583
I see.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.127
Well, then, you've found me.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.547
I am Prince Ezran.

16:15.725 --> 16:16.559
[door opens]

16:18.978 --> 16:20.980
Not a great day for a picnic, Viren.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.566
On that, we agree.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.280
Moonshadow elves
are dangerous, elite fighters.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.116
Under a full moon,
they become nearly invisible,

16:32.200 --> 16:34.160
and they can penetrate any defense.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.246
Nothing in the five kingdoms
can stop them.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.498
I know this.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.251
They will find you,
and they will kill you.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.212
Not helping, Viren.

16:44.295 --> 16:47.840
But it doesn't have to be you.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.303
In the black sands of the Midnight Desert

16:52.386 --> 16:56.724
dwells a mysterious snake
called a soulfang serpent.

16:57.308 --> 17:00.186
The soulfang has an unusual diet.

17:00.269 --> 17:04.232
Its bite drains and consumes
the spirit of its prey.

17:04.857 --> 17:10.696
On our last journey into Xadia,
I acquired a rather unique specimen.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.995
[hissing]

17:18.079 --> 17:22.542
Two heads, two bites,
two souls held at once.

17:22.625 --> 17:27.421
And through magic,
I can switch your spirit with another.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.425
The Moonshadow elves
will find the king's body,

17:32.093 --> 17:34.929
but your spirit will survive.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.393
I have to do this. I'm sorry.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.645
I don't want to, but I have to.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.897
Why? You know this is wrong.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.149
An assassin
doesn't decide right and wrong,

17:47.233 --> 17:49.110
only life and death.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.113
That's very clever, but come on, really?
How does this solve anything?

17:52.196 --> 17:55.783
This is justice.
Humans attacked us unprovoked.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.035
So it's okay
for you to do the same thing?

17:58.119 --> 18:03.291
Well, no. It's not the same thing,
because we're attacking you provoked.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.251
Then it's a cycle.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.962
You hurt me, someone will get revenge
against the elves.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.131
-It won't end.
-[Ezran] Callum.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.216
Psst, Callum.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.051
Shh, go away.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.220
[Ezran] I found something.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.180
Are you talking to that painting?

18:18.264 --> 18:20.766
[chuckles nervously]
Uh, why would I do that?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.935
'Cause it's not a good time.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.563
[Ezran] You mean,
because you're with a girl?

18:28.899 --> 18:31.777
Uh... Jelly tart?

18:31.861 --> 18:33.237
Kid, get out of here.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.488
Callum, what's going on?

18:34.572 --> 18:37.325
Callum? I thought you were Prince Ezran.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.826
You lied to me.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.911
Okay, how is that worse
than trying to kill someone?

18:40.995 --> 18:43.122
[chomps and swallows]

18:43.956 --> 18:46.917
Have you met Bait?
Say hello to my little friend.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.880
[Rayla screams]

18:53.257 --> 18:56.010
Callum, follow me.
I have to show you something.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.223
[panting]

19:08.105 --> 19:11.317
No. I won't hide in the body of another,

19:11.400 --> 19:14.612
while someone else dies
paying the price for my decisions.

19:14.695 --> 19:18.491
Two hundred men and women
are ready to fall protecting you tonight,

19:18.991 --> 19:22.078
but you won't let one soldier
sacrifice their life for you?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.829
It's not the same.

19:24.497 --> 19:28.626
I would rather die a king,
than live as a coward.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.588
Ah. So, that's what this is really about.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.215
What are you talking about?

19:34.298 --> 19:35.216
Pride.

19:35.299 --> 19:40.304
No, I already told you the problem.
It's dark magic.

19:40.388 --> 19:44.642
Yes, it is. It's clever.
It's brilliant. It's practical.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.353
It will save your life
and many, many others.

19:47.436 --> 19:48.771
It's a shortcut.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.272
We may not pay now,

19:50.356 --> 19:53.150
but we will pay
the blood price eventually.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.487
What do you think got us here? Dark magic!

19:56.570 --> 19:59.532
[scoffs] You're acting
stubborn and ungrateful.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.576
Should I be grateful
that you destroyed that dragon's egg?

20:02.660 --> 20:05.830
Thank you
for starting this unwinnable war?

20:05.913 --> 20:08.916
Thank you for angering
the dragons and the elves so much

20:08.999 --> 20:10.876
that tonight they are here for my life?

20:10.960 --> 20:16.090
Destroying that egg saved our kingdom.
Maybe all of humanity.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.925
It was an egg!

20:18.008 --> 20:21.220
And it would have become
the most powerful creature in the world!

20:26.183 --> 20:27.184
[Harrow exhales]

20:27.935 --> 20:34.316
What is done cannot be undone.
I am offering you a path forward.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.278
Your discomfort is understandable.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.573
You don't feel right
trading your life for another's.

20:40.656 --> 20:44.493
But know this,
every one of these men and women

20:44.577 --> 20:48.497
would gladly trade their life
to save yours.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.337
Would you, Viren?

20:56.172 --> 20:57.882
I... [sighs]

21:00.176 --> 21:01.218
Get out.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.270
[both panting]

21:14.231 --> 21:15.691
[Rayla] You're only making this worse.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.901
Worse how?

21:16.984 --> 21:18.110
[Ezran] This way.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.907
We're trapped. What do we do now?

21:24.533 --> 21:25.743
Time for a puzzle.

21:27.036 --> 21:30.623
Rock, rock, stone, rock, stone, stone.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.875
-Rock, stone, rock, stone, stone...
-Wait, what's the difference

21:32.958 --> 21:34.168
between the rocks and the stones?

21:34.251 --> 21:37.129
Ugh! You made me do stone
instead of rock.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.006
Rock, rock, stone, rock,

21:39.089 --> 21:42.009
-stone, stone, rock, stone, rock.
-Uh...

21:42.092 --> 21:43.969
[door opening]

21:53.562 --> 21:54.647
Wow.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.370
Yes!

22:09.453 --> 22:11.121
You're sure
she won't be able to follow us?

22:11.205 --> 22:14.500
No way. It took me over a month
to figure out that combination.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.794
[door opening]

22:19.964 --> 22:21.549
But how did you...

22:21.632 --> 22:24.468
I just pressed all the stones
with the jelly handprints.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.777
What is this place?

22:42.611 --> 22:43.862
Runaan is right.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.116
There's nothing in humans worth sparing.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.743
Time's up.

22:49.827 --> 22:52.454
Humans destroyed the egg
of the Dragon Prince.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.415
There must be justice.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.167
You'll have to get through me.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.253
Really?

23:00.004 --> 23:01.880
Wait. You need to see something.

23:01.964 --> 23:05.009
I'm not falling
for that flashing frog trick again.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.927
[Ezran] He's a glow toad.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.556
But there's no trick this time.
Please, look.

23:13.726 --> 23:17.021
Fine. You uncover it. Slowly.

23:17.938 --> 23:21.108
I can hear something inside,
something alive.

23:25.946 --> 23:29.241
[gasps] It... It can't be.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.745
The egg. It wasn't destroyed.
