- His official title

01:12.549 --> 01:13.583
is Youth Pastor

01:13.616 --> 01:16.251
at Sand Hills Neighborhood
Church in California.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.053
I'm asking you to be in this.

01:18.086 --> 01:20.122
I can't get it done without you.

01:20.155 --> 01:21.990
Be with Mabel.

01:22.024 --> 01:23.158
Wherever she's at,
guide her steps

01:23.192 --> 01:26.729
Mr. Guy Sides!

01:29.264 --> 01:31.734
Give it up for DJ Jazzy Carl!

01:33.101 --> 01:34.036
Yeah!

01:34.069 --> 01:35.505
Good to see you!

01:35.538 --> 01:37.339
Thank you.

01:37.372 --> 01:39.007
Thank you so much.

01:39.041 --> 01:40.477
You know, we've
been on this tour,

01:40.510 --> 01:43.045
and this is the third
month of this tour,

01:43.078 --> 01:44.481
and I have realized,

01:44.514 --> 01:46.716
I should've brought more
than two pair of pants.

01:49.051 --> 01:49.652
Oh!

01:49.686 --> 01:50.687
Ho-ho!

01:50.720 --> 01:52.789
Yeah, well, a beach ball.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.691
I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to...

01:54.724 --> 01:55.625
I'm supposed to sign.

01:57.059 --> 01:57.627
Alright, let me
sign the beach ball.

01:57.660 --> 01:58.728
Okay.

01:58.761 --> 01:59.762
Thank you.

01:59.796 --> 02:02.164
Very exciting, I understand.

02:02.197 --> 02:03.600
Thank you, efficient stagehand.

02:03.633 --> 02:04.534
Thanks, Guy.

02:04.567 --> 02:05.602
I'm not sure who threw this,

02:05.635 --> 02:08.770
but I'll just throw it back
that general direction.

02:08.805 --> 02:10.172
All right.

02:10.205 --> 02:12.642
Okay, let's get
back to why I came.

02:12.675 --> 02:17.112
This is gonna sound like I'm
exaggerating, but I am not.

02:17.145 --> 02:20.115
If you miss this,
you miss everything.

02:27.590 --> 02:29.091
- Hey.
- They were fun.

02:29.124 --> 02:30.593
That was awesome.

02:30.627 --> 02:31.794
If they cry, they buy.

02:31.828 --> 02:33.696
Oh, man, why
you gotta do that?

02:33.730 --> 02:34.631
What?

02:34.664 --> 02:36.131
They're people with souls.

02:36.164 --> 02:38.200
Absolutely, absolutely.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.503
But that beach ball action,

02:41.604 --> 02:42.839
that could be a thing.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.339
- Beach ball?
- Yeah.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.108
- That was just spontaneous-
- Well, it was

02:46.141 --> 02:47.744
spontaneously brilliant, okay?

02:47.777 --> 02:48.811
How 'bout that?

02:48.845 --> 02:51.146
I've seen things, and I've
seen how things start,

02:51.179 --> 02:52.448
and you definitely
started a thing.

02:52.482 --> 02:53.816
That's a thing.

02:53.850 --> 02:56.786
Hey, don't leave
the souls waiting.

02:56.819 --> 02:58.186
Go get 'em.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.354
Guy Sides, y'all!

02:59.389 --> 03:00.222
Chicago!

03:00.890 --> 03:02.492
Yeah!

03:02.525 --> 03:03.459
All right!

03:18.841 --> 03:20.577
I'm asking you to be in this.

03:20.610 --> 03:23.211
We can't get it
done without you.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.447
Be with Mabel.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.682
Wherever she's at,

03:25.715 --> 03:26.616
- guide her steps.
- And you know him

03:26.649 --> 03:28.518
as America's youth pastor,

03:28.551 --> 03:32.120
Guy Sides!

03:33.288 --> 03:34.691
If you miss this,

03:34.724 --> 03:36.124
you miss everything.

03:36.158 --> 03:38.260
If you miss this,

03:38.293 --> 03:40.730
you miss everything.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.398
If you miss this,

03:42.432 --> 03:46.869
you miss everything.

03:46.903 --> 03:48.404
There's was my guy.

03:48.438 --> 03:49.505
Hey!

03:49.539 --> 03:50.573
Nailed it again.

03:50.607 --> 03:51.808
- Nailed it again.
- I-

03:51.841 --> 03:53.241
I just hope they
heard the gospel,

03:53.275 --> 03:54.777
- and the deeper-
- Totes, totes.

03:54.811 --> 03:56.244
Totes, they did.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.212
But here's the thing.

03:57.245 --> 03:58.280
That beach ball thing,

03:58.313 --> 04:00.148
we need to capitalize on it.

04:00.182 --> 04:02.217
From now on, you are officially
the "Beach Ball Guy".

04:02.250 --> 04:05.287
- No, I am absolutely not
- No, you absolutely are

04:05.320 --> 04:06.556
- the "Beach Ball Guy".
- the "Beach Ball Guy".

04:06.589 --> 04:07.222
- And absolutely means-
- And let me tell you-

04:07.255 --> 04:07.890
Listen.

04:07.924 --> 04:08.925
- It's bigger than
- Nada.

04:08.958 --> 04:09.926
- either one of us.
- No.

04:09.959 --> 04:10.793
You made it a thing!

04:10.827 --> 04:12.327
It's a thing
I'm not gonna do.

04:12.361 --> 04:12.929
Okay, brother.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.262
We can talk about it.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.197
We can always talk about it.

04:15.230 --> 04:17.666
But I need you right
now to be the baller

04:17.700 --> 04:18.601
I know you can be.

04:18.635 --> 04:19.569
Now, you go out there,

04:19.601 --> 04:20.937
and ball till you fall!

04:20.970 --> 04:22.405
Hey, y'all, look who's here!

04:22.438 --> 04:24.206
Mr. Baller!

04:24.239 --> 04:25.240
- Oh, look at that!
- Hi, you you doin'?

04:25.273 --> 04:26.075
And they got

04:26.109 --> 04:27.510
- the beach balls!
- Good to see you.

04:27.543 --> 04:28.711
And they
got the beach balls!

04:28.745 --> 04:29.545
Great, thank you.

04:29.579 --> 04:31.681
If you miss this,

04:31.714 --> 04:34.316
you miss everything.

04:34.349 --> 04:37.352
Guys, listen,

04:37.387 --> 04:39.422
if you miss this,
you miss everything.

04:42.558 --> 04:43.860
Hey, there he is.

04:43.893 --> 04:45.061
I told you, man.

04:45.094 --> 04:47.295
I told you this beach ball
thing is bigger than any of us.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.498
It's a thing.

04:48.531 --> 04:49.899
How does anybody take
the gospel seriously

04:49.932 --> 04:51.834
with all this nonsense?

04:52.702 --> 04:54.570
But it's interesting.

04:54.604 --> 04:59.609
You realize, interesting
is Christian code for crazy.

05:00.543 --> 05:03.245
But crazy in a
good way, right?

05:03.278 --> 05:03.880
Right?

05:10.019 --> 05:12.522
Sign this?

05:13.690 --> 05:15.323
What would Jesus do?

05:15.357 --> 05:16.959
This still happenin'?

05:16.993 --> 05:18.995
I have an idea.

05:19.028 --> 05:21.798
Why don't we talk about
what Jesus has done?

05:21.831 --> 05:24.266
Died and rose again, right?

05:25.568 --> 05:27.302
Oh, I have Jesus in my heart.

05:27.335 --> 05:30.305
What I don't have, is a beach
ball with your name on it.

05:35.812 --> 05:37.647
1st Corinthians 15,

05:37.680 --> 05:40.450
it's about what Jesus did.

05:40.483 --> 05:41.784
Thanks.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.558
If you miss-

05:52.595 --> 05:54.430
You know, I think we missed it.

05:54.464 --> 05:58.366
Guys, could you dial it
back with the beach balls?

06:07.342 --> 06:09.378
It's like the entire church
has become the youth group.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.345
Boom!

06:10.379 --> 06:11.714
That's our new slogan.

06:11.748 --> 06:13.750
"Our whole church
is a youth group."

06:13.783 --> 06:15.017
That's interesting.

06:17.553 --> 06:19.021
Oh, man!

06:19.055 --> 06:21.657
That's the third one this week.

06:22.825 --> 06:23.993
So rough tour?

06:26.662 --> 06:27.764
I want out.

06:28.998 --> 06:30.466
What's going on with you?

06:30.500 --> 06:32.367
You need some time off?

06:33.402 --> 06:35.303
It's deeper than that.

06:35.337 --> 06:36.371
Is this a faith crisis?

06:36.405 --> 06:38.373
No, not at all.

06:38.407 --> 06:40.076
Remember back when
first started?

06:40.109 --> 06:42.545
Yeah, those were good times.

06:42.578 --> 06:45.782
We had 60 people at the most,

06:45.815 --> 06:48.751
and all we did was
preach the gospel.

06:48.785 --> 06:50.620
Ooh, Superman works.

06:50.653 --> 06:52.455
I like Superman.

06:52.488 --> 06:53.422
Are you listening to me?

06:53.456 --> 06:54.757
Yes, of course!

06:54.791 --> 06:56.559
"A good pastor
has to multitask."

06:56.592 --> 06:57.660
It was in my book.

06:57.693 --> 06:58.594
Go on.

06:58.628 --> 07:00.797
I can't function like this.

07:00.830 --> 07:03.499
Evangelicalism has
become this machine

07:03.533 --> 07:05.367
and it's eating me up.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.637
Take a nap.

07:07.670 --> 07:09.005
"A good nap always
refreshes me."

07:09.038 --> 07:10.473
That was also in my book.

07:10.506 --> 07:13.075
Did you even read my book?

07:13.109 --> 07:14.510
Wow!

07:14.544 --> 07:15.812
Those are both good.

07:15.845 --> 07:17.947
Guy, what do you think?

07:17.980 --> 07:19.115
I'm done.

07:19.148 --> 07:20.883
He's right, no masks.

07:20.917 --> 07:22.418
So let's stick with Superman.

07:22.451 --> 07:23.820
Thanks.

07:23.853 --> 07:26.122
You're the most popular
youth pastor in the country.

07:26.155 --> 07:27.690
Everybody loves you.

07:27.723 --> 07:29.625
They'll find someone else.

07:29.659 --> 07:32.595
America's youth
pastor can't quit.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.499
America would be bummed.

07:37.767 --> 07:40.503
Your kids would
be really bummed.

07:41.737 --> 07:43.439
Guy, listen to me.

07:45.608 --> 07:47.743
I know you're under
a lot of pressure.

07:47.777 --> 07:49.478
I get it.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.380
I'm feelin' it too.

07:51.414 --> 07:55.418
I need something big for
Good Friday and Easter.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.788
Bigger than the resurrection?

07:59.722 --> 08:02.124
Maybe I've hit my ceiling?

08:02.158 --> 08:03.159
I rode in on a Harley.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.493
I rode in on a cow.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.529
I got shot out of a cannon.

08:06.562 --> 08:08.397
What if you dial
it back for a year?

08:08.431 --> 08:10.766
No, no, more is more, Guy!

08:12.168 --> 08:13.970
More show, more
people in the seats.

08:14.003 --> 08:15.404
More people in the seats,

08:15.438 --> 08:17.540
more people get to
hear the gospel!

08:17.573 --> 08:20.176
I'm not sure
your math adds up.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.477
What is it?

08:22.845 --> 08:24.380
What's the hook?

08:26.515 --> 08:29.852
I would love to
help you, but I quit.

08:29.886 --> 08:31.454
No, you are not quitting.

08:31.487 --> 08:32.520
I am.

08:33.489 --> 08:36.458
Fine, quit after
you take a nap.

08:36.491 --> 08:38.059
Although, use this.

08:41.097 --> 08:43.099
It'll change your life.

08:43.131 --> 08:47.203
I love you, brother.

08:48.971 --> 08:50.940
Guy, perfect timing.

08:50.973 --> 08:52.174
Robert and I are
just about finished

08:52.208 --> 08:54.677
blowing up beach
balls for you to sign.

08:56.812 --> 08:58.714
I quit, I quit, I quit!

08:58.748 --> 09:01.684
I said, I quit!

09:01.717 --> 09:03.486
I-

09:04.220 --> 09:05.655
Sorry.

09:05.688 --> 09:07.223
Can we get the beach
balls to listen to me?

09:13.796 --> 09:14.730
Guy!

09:14.764 --> 09:15.564
You're back?

09:15.598 --> 09:16.866
Hey, I gotta...

09:16.899 --> 09:18.034
I'm on my way out.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.035
Cool.

09:19.068 --> 09:20.202
We'll catch up.

09:20.236 --> 09:24.807
Remember, big smiles
and have a blessed service.

09:26.776 --> 09:30.947
Chad, I'm not watching
where I'm going.

09:30.980 --> 09:33.582
Where are you going?

09:33.616 --> 09:36.585
It's a good question.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.521
You're tired.

09:38.554 --> 09:41.123
I don't think a
nap can fix that.

09:42.291 --> 09:43.125
Right.

09:44.026 --> 09:46.462
Wait, why would you say that?

09:47.863 --> 09:49.699
It's my gift.

09:49.732 --> 09:50.967
I know things,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.169
like when people are tired.

09:58.107 --> 09:59.942
Chad, why are you here?

09:59.976 --> 10:01.677
Oh, I'm training
more greeters today.

10:01.711 --> 10:02.778
No, I mean-

10:03.913 --> 10:05.648
- Oh, existentially?

10:05.681 --> 10:06.649
Exactly!

10:06.682 --> 10:08.117
Why are you here?

10:10.019 --> 10:12.054
I am here to serve.

10:12.088 --> 10:13.622
Jesus laid down his life for us,

10:13.656 --> 10:16.225
so we oughta be
willing to do the same.

10:19.795 --> 10:21.097
I've gotta go.

10:22.565 --> 10:24.633
Guy?

10:24.667 --> 10:26.669
You didn't say
goodbye to your kids.

10:41.650 --> 10:42.486
Thanks, Chad.

10:46.922 --> 10:49.592
Sheila, hey, will you go
find a mop from the closet?

10:49.625 --> 10:51.260
Jeremy, go to the pantry,

10:51.293 --> 10:53.929
see if you can find some rice
to dry out Blaise's phone.

10:53.963 --> 10:55.664
Blaise, take five.

10:57.266 --> 11:01.003
I'm really glad things
are back to normal.

11:01.037 --> 11:02.671
It must've been a power nap?

11:02.705 --> 11:03.539
Hmm.

11:05.141 --> 11:07.243
Chad, it's me.

11:07.276 --> 11:09.545
I'm not a real superhero.

11:10.613 --> 11:12.048

12:15.344 --> 12:17.713
Hey, before we let you go,

12:18.848 --> 12:22.818
I told you, if we broke
attendance records this quarter,

12:22.852 --> 12:25.054
I'd get the church logo
tattooed on my arm.

12:25.087 --> 12:27.323
And we broke those records,

12:27.356 --> 12:29.892
and Pastor Skip
keeps his promises.

12:32.228 --> 12:36.098
If we hit our goal of 500 new
attendees by next quarter,

12:36.132 --> 12:37.233
I'm gonna get pierced.

12:38.367 --> 12:39.168
Okay.

12:39.201 --> 12:40.202
Bring it on.

12:47.910 --> 12:52.748
Okay, if you wanna turn in
your phones to 1st John 3:16.

12:52.781 --> 12:55.918
That's 1st John 3:16,
not the gospel of.

12:58.087 --> 13:00.089
Hey, you guys, I
wanna say something.

13:00.122 --> 13:02.224
I realized I haven't
been around a lot lately,

13:02.258 --> 13:04.927
and I want you to know,
that's gonna change.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.965
All right, who wants to read
our a verse for tonight?

13:10.433 --> 13:10.866
Blaise.

13:12.768 --> 13:16.038
"This is how we
know what love is."

13:16.071 --> 13:18.807
"Jesus laid down
his life for us,

13:18.841 --> 13:23.480
and we ought to lay down
our lives for each other."

13:23.513 --> 13:26.749
Jesus laid down
his life for us.

13:28.017 --> 13:31.353
How do most of us
think about that?

13:31.388 --> 13:33.822
Try really hard to be good.

13:38.127 --> 13:41.464
God loves the mess
that you are right now.

13:41.498 --> 13:43.433
The point of the gospel,

13:43.466 --> 13:46.035
is that we can't be like Jesus.

13:46.068 --> 13:50.473
We can't be as good as
we think we should be.

13:50.507 --> 13:53.242
Jesus laid down
his life for you.

13:54.377 --> 13:56.845
You never have to
prove yourself again.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.782
Jesus laid down
his life for you,

13:59.815 --> 14:02.885
and God's love is
bigger than our mess.

14:08.525 --> 14:10.025
I thought you were
gonna go as Superman?

14:10.059 --> 14:11.860
No, we couldn't
get the clearance.

14:11.894 --> 14:15.898
I couldn't even get
Super Positive cleared.

14:15.931 --> 14:17.166
Pretty hardcore, huh?

14:17.199 --> 14:18.801
Yeah, we heard
you in the Youth Room.

14:18.834 --> 14:20.403
It
didn't hurt too bad.

14:20.437 --> 14:21.770
Should that be
bleedin' like that?

14:21.804 --> 14:24.039
Oh, I don't know.

14:24.073 --> 14:26.375
What do you think Carla's
gonna say when she sees it?

14:26.409 --> 14:28.210
Just wear sleeves
when you Skype.

14:28.244 --> 14:29.078
No, she's coming home.

14:29.111 --> 14:29.945
- Carla?
- Yeah.

14:29.979 --> 14:31.046
- Your daughter?
- Yeah.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.147
- The missionary?
- Yeah.

14:32.181 --> 14:33.483
I thought I told you?

14:33.516 --> 14:34.551
Yeah, you told me.

14:34.584 --> 14:35.518
Are you being sarcastic?

14:35.552 --> 14:36.553
I am.

14:36.586 --> 14:37.587
Oh, fun.

14:37.621 --> 14:39.188
Yeah, she just broke
things off with her fiance,

14:39.221 --> 14:40.356
and I wanna get her set up

14:40.390 --> 14:41.257
- into a stable relationship.
- Oh.

14:41.290 --> 14:42.425
Oh, wow, I don't know.

14:42.459 --> 14:43.526
- My schedule-
- I'm gonna set

14:43.560 --> 14:44.893
her up with Tino.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.028
Wait, Tino?

14:47.363 --> 14:50.199
♪ Thank the Lord. ♪

14:52.234 --> 14:53.902
Come on, people!

14:53.936 --> 14:57.339
I mean, the audience is
expecting a lot from me.

14:57.373 --> 14:58.974
Us.

14:59.008 --> 14:59.842
I don't even understand,

14:59.875 --> 15:01.110
why did I even write it

15:01.143 --> 15:03.546
if you can't even play
it the way I felt it?

15:03.580 --> 15:05.180
To glorify God?

15:06.616 --> 15:09.552
If God
wanted to be glorified,

15:09.586 --> 15:11.920
he would hire professionals.

15:13.222 --> 15:14.290
Are you punishing her?

15:14.323 --> 15:15.157
What?

15:16.058 --> 15:17.494
He'd be great for her.

15:17.527 --> 15:18.827
He's stable.

15:18.861 --> 15:20.029
Doesn't have ideas.

15:20.062 --> 15:21.531
He produces volume.

15:21.564 --> 15:22.364
How could she resist?

15:22.399 --> 15:24.266
Talk him up!

15:24.300 --> 15:25.834
I got an idea.

15:25.868 --> 15:27.870
Let her live her life.

15:27.903 --> 15:29.539
That's just crazy talk.

15:29.572 --> 15:31.240
It's in your book.

15:31.273 --> 15:32.875
Oh, you're right.

15:37.279 --> 15:39.915
Is it wrong to lust
after a mannequin?

15:42.151 --> 15:42.951
What?

15:42.985 --> 15:44.286
You're busy.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.120
Sorry.

15:45.154 --> 15:45.954
No, no, no.

15:45.988 --> 15:46.855
No, come on...

15:46.889 --> 15:48.057
Come in.

15:48.090 --> 15:49.892
Grab a chair.

15:49.925 --> 15:50.893
Have a seat.

15:54.163 --> 15:56.198
Now, what's the issue?

15:56.231 --> 15:58.635
You know how mannequins
can be super hot?

15:58.668 --> 16:01.303
Is it wrong to think that?

16:01.337 --> 16:03.540
I mean, they're not human.

16:03.573 --> 16:04.940
They're wood.

16:04.973 --> 16:06.875
Most are plastic.

16:06.909 --> 16:08.944
So you get it?

16:08.977 --> 16:09.978
I don't know where
you're shoppin'-

16:10.012 --> 16:11.914
- Oh, they're everywhere.

16:11.947 --> 16:14.950
And at first, I was turning
my eyes away from real girls

16:14.983 --> 16:16.885
and then there they were.

16:16.919 --> 16:18.320
I mean, everywhere.

16:19.556 --> 16:22.592
Well, Blaise, as a teenager,

16:22.625 --> 16:25.294
I imagine you still have lots of

16:26.396 --> 16:28.531
changes going on in your body.

16:28.565 --> 16:30.633
Because I'm born again now?

16:30.667 --> 16:31.468
No.

16:33.102 --> 16:36.038
Have you talked to your
parents about this?

16:36.071 --> 16:37.906
Mannequin lust?

16:37.940 --> 16:39.074
Well, I meant, you know,

16:39.108 --> 16:41.411
becoming a Christian, and
hanging out at church, all that?

16:41.444 --> 16:43.413
They're uber supportive,

16:43.446 --> 16:47.149
and whatever makes me
happy, that's their thing.

16:47.182 --> 16:48.518
Well, Blaise,

16:49.686 --> 16:51.688
you can't have a
meaningful relationship

16:51.721 --> 16:54.524
with those kinda women.

16:54.557 --> 16:57.494
I can't believe I'm
callin' 'em women.

16:57.527 --> 16:58.595
They're nothing!

16:58.628 --> 17:00.397
They're heartless.

17:00.430 --> 17:01.664
They're brainless.

17:01.698 --> 17:02.699
They all are.

17:02.732 --> 17:05.032
So I'm guessing
you're still single?

17:07.169 --> 17:11.708
Can I help you?

17:11.741 --> 17:12.575
Really?

17:13.710 --> 17:15.944
Yeah, I think
that's how it works.

17:15.978 --> 17:18.213
You come into my
office, and I help you.

17:18.247 --> 17:20.949
Do you have a kid
in our program?

17:20.983 --> 17:21.983
No.

17:22.017 --> 17:23.486
No kids, no husband.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.155
That's good.

17:26.188 --> 17:27.122
I don't mean it's good.

17:27.156 --> 17:29.091
I mean, it's not bad either.

17:29.124 --> 17:30.359
I just...

17:30.393 --> 17:31.394
All I mean is,

17:31.428 --> 17:33.996
single people are often single.

17:36.399 --> 17:37.734
You talk for a living, right?

17:42.037 --> 17:43.071
Yikes!

17:43.105 --> 17:45.140
That's a rough first impression.

17:45.174 --> 17:47.042
Oh, don't worry about that.

17:47.075 --> 17:49.712
I got my first impression
of him a long time ago.

17:49.746 --> 17:51.414
You did?

17:51.448 --> 17:54.717
When would that have been
at, a conference, or...

17:54.751 --> 17:57.119
I'm sorry, I'm lost here.

17:57.152 --> 17:59.288
Yeah,
I would say you are,

17:59.321 --> 18:01.691
and you obviously need
help more than I do,

18:01.724 --> 18:04.059
which is why I'm here.

18:04.092 --> 18:06.396
So you're here to volunteer?

18:07.664 --> 18:09.131
If that's the case,

18:09.164 --> 18:10.733
you need to be a church member,

18:10.767 --> 18:14.236
and fill out an
application form.

18:15.472 --> 18:17.440
I am a long-time
church member,

18:17.474 --> 18:18.575
and I can write.

18:18.608 --> 18:21.176
So we're off to a good start.

18:21.210 --> 18:23.245
This is Blaise.

18:23.278 --> 18:24.279
And you are?

18:25.815 --> 18:27.015
Pleased to meet you.

18:27.049 --> 18:28.551
I see how it is.

18:29.419 --> 18:30.252
Do you know Jesus?

18:30.285 --> 18:31.387
He's a new believer.

18:31.421 --> 18:32.622
Yes, I do.

18:32.655 --> 18:34.256
I could climb a
mountain for Jesus!

18:34.289 --> 18:35.792
Who is very enthusiastic.

18:35.825 --> 18:37.159
Seriously, throw me a rope.

18:37.192 --> 18:39.061
Blaise, you are a pickle.

18:39.094 --> 18:39.995
Thank you.

18:40.028 --> 18:42.030
Don't you have a jar
you need to get to?

18:42.064 --> 18:42.765
I was just headed to the mall.

18:42.799 --> 18:43.800
No, no, no, no!

18:43.833 --> 18:44.767
Sit, sit!

18:44.801 --> 18:47.770
Oh, so here's a volunteer
application form

18:47.804 --> 18:50.773
that you'll need
to fill out now.

18:54.844 --> 18:56.713
Sneaky way of getting my name.

18:56.746 --> 18:58.180
This is weird.

18:58.213 --> 18:59.114
Is this flirting?

18:59.147 --> 19:00.550
Unless you wanna back out?

19:00.583 --> 19:02.150
Wait, can you date volunteers?

19:02.184 --> 19:03.520
Why would I wanna back out?

19:03.553 --> 19:05.087
That's like a
church policy, right?

19:05.120 --> 19:07.089
Yes, Blaise, there's a policy.

19:07.122 --> 19:08.591
Is that right?

19:08.625 --> 19:11.093
May I just...

19:11.126 --> 19:13.095
So you're turning me down?

19:13.128 --> 19:15.297
Church policy
dictates that I must.

19:15.330 --> 19:18.701
Well, we are under
grace here, not law.

19:22.271 --> 19:25.073
You just threw away my name.

19:25.107 --> 19:29.144
Okay, so when you figure
it out, give me a call.

19:29.177 --> 19:30.613
Let me know how I can help.

19:30.647 --> 19:35.217
So nice
to meet you, Blaise.

19:43.393 --> 19:44.661
Carla Finney.

19:46.896 --> 19:49.699
Is that Pastor Skip's daughter?

19:50.867 --> 19:52.100
I mean, they both have
the same last name,

19:52.134 --> 19:54.871
so is it?

20:09.919 --> 20:11.487

chance to be insincere yet.

20:14.356 --> 20:16.325

20:16.358 --> 20:18.494

Wow!

21:23.593 --> 21:24.527
I know.

21:25.528 --> 21:26.896
I just made that up just now.

21:26.929 --> 21:27.964
Did you?

21:27.997 --> 21:29.932
My whole life is a musical.

21:29.966 --> 21:31.266
Enchanting.

21:31.299 --> 21:32.769
Except for the talking parts,

21:32.802 --> 21:35.672
because it's kind of a
disappointment when I have to talk.

21:35.705 --> 21:37.272
I can see that.

21:37.305 --> 21:37.974
Really?

21:38.007 --> 21:39.609
Yeah.

21:39.642 --> 21:40.810
We get each other.

21:40.843 --> 21:42.310
Oh, you know, dad
and I have to...

21:42.344 --> 21:43.311
There's a...

All right.

22:02.532 --> 22:03.633
You didn't even try.

22:03.666 --> 22:06.301
You could be his leading lady.

22:06.334 --> 22:08.638
I am happy just
being a bit player.

22:08.671 --> 22:10.305
You won't even go
on one date with him?

22:10.338 --> 22:12.307
That's never gonna happen.

22:12.340 --> 22:13.009
Never say never, honey.

22:13.042 --> 22:14.143
It's an ugly word.

22:14.177 --> 22:16.344
Dad, I didn't come home
for another relationship.

22:16.379 --> 22:17.847
I came home to recover from one.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.516
I know, I'm just
thinking long-term here.

22:20.550 --> 22:22.885
I'm just here on
a round-trip ticket.

22:22.919 --> 22:24.319
What?

22:24.352 --> 22:26.321
I thought you were here to stay?

22:26.354 --> 22:27.289
Maybe.

22:27.322 --> 22:28.356
We'll see.

22:28.391 --> 22:30.393
Ooh, there's Tino's car.

22:30.426 --> 22:31.359
It's new.

22:31.394 --> 22:32.495
It's electric.

22:32.528 --> 22:36.264
Dad, it's a nice car, but
it doesn't change the man.

22:36.298 --> 22:37.166
I just don't want you with

22:37.200 --> 22:39.035
any more of these
crazy, ambitious-types.

22:39.068 --> 22:40.335
Bump.

22:44.741 --> 22:45.942
Tino's ambitious.

22:45.975 --> 22:49.545
Yeah, but he's too
simple to pull it off.

22:51.781 --> 22:54.316
Look, a fellow who
keeps things simple

22:54.349 --> 22:55.350
is not gonna hurt you.

22:55.384 --> 22:56.619
They won't abandon you,

22:56.652 --> 22:59.455
and they're not gonna
take you away from here.

22:59.489 --> 23:02.290
That's funny coming from a
man who leaves professionally.

23:02.324 --> 23:05.027
I was never gone for more
than three months at a time.

23:05.061 --> 23:07.295
You were gone for
nine months, Dad.

23:07.329 --> 23:08.531
Not true.

23:08.564 --> 23:11.501
Technically, those were three
consecutive book tours, right?

23:11.534 --> 23:13.736
Oh, okay, all better.

23:13.770 --> 23:15.872
Come on, I was
home every Sunday.

23:15.905 --> 23:19.442
Ew, technically, you
are here every Sunday.

23:19.475 --> 23:20.777
Ouch.

23:20.810 --> 23:23.412
I know you were making
major life decisions

23:23.446 --> 23:24.380
and I was not there for you,

23:24.413 --> 23:28.350
and I will regret that
for the rest of my life.

23:28.384 --> 23:30.887
It's good to
hear you say that,

23:30.920 --> 23:33.355
'cause I always felt like you
ministered to everyone else

23:33.389 --> 23:34.490
but your own family.

23:34.524 --> 23:36.592
And for that, I am so sorry.

23:36.626 --> 23:38.728
The good news is, I'm
not going anywhere,

23:38.761 --> 23:40.530
and now, neither are you.

23:42.131 --> 23:43.331
Here we are.

23:46.636 --> 23:48.336
Carla, I'm really
glad you're home.

23:48.370 --> 23:49.639
It is so good to see you.

23:49.672 --> 23:51.107
You too.

23:51.140 --> 23:52.909
Oh, and I'll work on trying
to get you a better spot.

23:52.942 --> 23:54.377
Oh, no problem.

23:56.145 --> 23:57.547
I really enjoyed our chat.

23:57.580 --> 23:59.015
Me too.

23:59.048 --> 24:01.584
Will you at least think
about giving Tino a chance?

24:01.617 --> 24:03.351
I don't know, Dad.

24:03.386 --> 24:05.454
Honey, I can't fix all
the things I did wrong

24:05.488 --> 24:06.289
when you were a little girl,

24:06.321 --> 24:08.391
but maybe I can
make it up to you?

24:08.424 --> 24:10.760
All we can do is move forward.

24:10.793 --> 24:11.627
Okay.

24:12.628 --> 24:13.696
No, really.

24:13.729 --> 24:15.398
All we can do is move forward.

24:15.431 --> 24:16.699
The reverse is broken.

24:16.732 --> 24:19.035
I'm gonna need you
to push me back.

24:19.068 --> 24:20.570
You want me to push?

24:20.603 --> 24:22.638
I have to drive.

24:22.672 --> 24:23.472
Yep.

24:23.506 --> 24:24.874
Get around front.

24:24.907 --> 24:26.843
Yeah.

24:26.876 --> 24:28.477
Put your shoulder into it.

24:28.511 --> 24:29.946
It's kinda heavy.

24:30.813 --> 24:32.114
Come on.

24:32.148 --> 24:33.382
Oh.

24:33.416 --> 24:34.116
Hey, babe?

24:34.150 --> 24:35.418
Babe.

24:35.451 --> 24:36.853
Walking through the door.

24:36.886 --> 24:38.454
I'm walking through the
doors as we speak, literally.

24:38.487 --> 24:39.922
Yes, I just walked
through the doors.

24:39.956 --> 24:41.090
As long as I don't

24:41.123 --> 24:42.758
- get held up by some-
- Pastor Guy?

24:42.792 --> 24:43.593
- Good to see you.
- Chad.

24:43.626 --> 24:46.062
Yes, I will...

24:46.095 --> 24:48.397
Yes, Chad, I'll be right up.

24:48.431 --> 24:49.599
Walmart's got nothin'
on you, buddy.

24:49.632 --> 24:50.833
Amateurs.

24:50.867 --> 24:53.069
Hey, I would love to
chat, but I am late.

24:53.102 --> 24:55.171
For your meeting
with Pastor Skip, yeah.

24:55.204 --> 24:57.506
Planning these events
can just be grueling.

24:57.540 --> 24:59.075
Yeah, they can.

24:59.108 --> 25:01.577
Each stunt having to be
bigger and better than the last.

25:01.611 --> 25:02.511
Oh, stunts.

25:02.545 --> 25:03.546
Heard you met with Carla?

25:03.579 --> 25:04.914
Wow.

25:04.947 --> 25:06.048
Wow what?

25:06.082 --> 25:08.184
Well, I just think you
two could make a great team.

25:08.217 --> 25:09.819
I mean, I'm focused
on the youth group.

25:09.852 --> 25:11.053
Nah, you're right,

25:11.087 --> 25:12.154
she'd probably just
be a distraction.

25:16.993 --> 25:19.161
I guess I could use some help?

25:19.195 --> 25:21.697
What a great idea.

25:21.731 --> 25:23.532
You should keep
going, you're late.

25:23.566 --> 25:24.867
Hey, thanks, Chad.

25:35.511 --> 25:39.515
There he is.

25:42.585 --> 25:43.686
I did it!

25:43.719 --> 25:45.087
I took my nap!

25:45.121 --> 25:46.455
Wham!

25:46.489 --> 25:47.490
It came to me.

25:47.523 --> 25:50.893
Something, really, really
big for Good Friday.

25:50.927 --> 25:52.528
Big.

25:52.561 --> 25:53.596
Uh-oh.

25:54.563 --> 25:57.967
This is gonna be our
most daring event ever.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.469
This year, for Good Friday,

26:00.503 --> 26:02.505
we are gonna have a crucifixion.

26:03.673 --> 26:05.508
You mean, a
passion play, right?

26:05.541 --> 26:08.544
Oh, no, no, no, an
actual crucifixion.

26:08.577 --> 26:12.214
Like they do in Mexico
and the Philippines?

26:12.248 --> 26:13.983
Wait.

26:14.016 --> 26:15.985
You knew about that?

26:16.018 --> 26:17.253
Why didn't you tell me?

26:17.286 --> 26:20.056
'Cause it's a
mockery of the Gospel.

26:20.089 --> 26:21.824
No, it's an homage.

26:22.959 --> 26:24.527
It's impactful.

26:24.560 --> 26:27.530
And we are bringin'
it to Sand Hills.

26:27.563 --> 26:31.534
You're gonna crucify
a human in church?

26:31.567 --> 26:32.501
Yes.

26:32.535 --> 26:36.605
This will cement us as
the cutting edge church.

26:36.639 --> 26:38.741
Okay, Skip, I realize
you can't see this,

26:38.774 --> 26:40.943
because you're crazy,

26:40.977 --> 26:43.980
but no one is going
to be okay with this.

26:44.013 --> 26:45.247
Everybody's okay with it.

26:45.281 --> 26:47.116
The board already approved it,

26:47.149 --> 26:51.287
and they approved shooting
confetti during the altar call.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.556
How does this involve me?

26:55.992 --> 26:58.027
I wanna give you the honor

26:58.060 --> 27:02.665
of being the first man
crucified in an American church.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.036
I have no role in this!

27:40.069 --> 27:41.871
It'll
be perfectly safe.

27:41.904 --> 27:44.273
That's the reason
Dr. Knott is here.

27:44.306 --> 27:45.274
You see, Guy,

27:45.307 --> 27:47.576
it wasn't the nails that
actually killed people.

27:47.610 --> 27:50.179
Most died by asphyxiation.

27:50.212 --> 27:51.013
See?

27:51.047 --> 27:52.281
Science.

27:52.314 --> 27:55.351
And no one in Mexico
has died from this.

27:55.385 --> 27:57.620
As far as we know.

27:57.653 --> 28:00.056
By placing the nails through
your palms in the right place,

28:00.089 --> 28:03.092
we hope to avoid
major nerve damage.

28:04.727 --> 28:06.729
Nothing is 100%.

28:06.762 --> 28:08.664
You'll have to sign
a waiver, of course,

28:08.697 --> 28:09.865
to protect the church.

28:09.899 --> 28:11.233
And one for me too.

28:11.267 --> 28:12.101
Sure.

28:13.869 --> 28:15.271
All right!

28:15.304 --> 28:17.673
Good meeting, everyone.

28:17.706 --> 28:19.341
Guy, Guy, wait, wait!

28:19.375 --> 28:20.176
Where are you going?

28:20.209 --> 28:21.310
Come on!

28:21.343 --> 28:23.345
You're the eighth person on
the staff to turn us down.

28:23.380 --> 28:25.347
Even Tino said no.

28:25.382 --> 28:26.849
Turns out, he's a bleeder.

28:26.882 --> 28:28.617
He doesn't have
enough platelets.

28:28.651 --> 28:30.886
He can't form scabs.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.955
Think about this, Guy.

28:32.988 --> 28:34.890
This is gonna be huge,

28:34.924 --> 28:37.626
bigger than anything
we've ever done,

28:37.660 --> 28:40.729
National headlines,
monster book sales.

28:40.763 --> 28:44.967
This is what I'm
trying to get away from.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.168
Gimmicks!

28:46.202 --> 28:48.304
You call it gimmicks,

28:48.337 --> 28:51.073
I call it souls in the seats.

28:51.107 --> 28:54.643
You know, Skip I think
the Gospel's enough.

29:00.349 --> 29:02.685
I did not see that coming.

29:07.123 --> 29:07.923
- Great seeing you too.
- Let me know if you

29:07.957 --> 29:09.191
need anymore help.

29:09.225 --> 29:10.693
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell me you stopped him?

29:10.726 --> 29:12.828
Stop Pastor Finney, Carla?

29:12.862 --> 29:14.096
Carla Finney.

29:14.130 --> 29:15.898
I get it, you
know who I am now.

29:15.931 --> 29:18.968
I'm sorry I didn't recognize
you, but you've aged.

29:19.001 --> 29:20.437
Thanks?

29:20.470 --> 29:22.138
That's what happens when
you've been gone for 10 years.

29:22.171 --> 29:25.241
No, you look way better
than a lot of women your age.

29:25.274 --> 29:27.009
- Should we talk about my dad?
- Yes.

29:27.042 --> 29:29.211
You are the only
one that can stop him.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.179
What are you gonna do?

29:30.212 --> 29:31.714
I told him he's insane.

29:31.747 --> 29:33.048
I'm not the lead pastor here.

29:33.082 --> 29:34.683
All I can do is what
I'm supposed to do,

29:34.717 --> 29:36.085
which is to care for these kids.

29:36.118 --> 29:37.786
What are you gonna do?

29:37.820 --> 29:38.721
I'm coming with you.

29:38.754 --> 29:39.255
Why do you think I'm here?

29:39.288 --> 29:40.356
I don't know.

29:40.390 --> 29:42.191
You're not exactly free
flowing with the information.

29:42.224 --> 29:45.395
Someone didn't let me finish
filling out my application.

29:45.428 --> 29:46.228
Come on!

29:46.262 --> 29:47.062
You said, you're late.

29:48.764 --> 29:49.698
- He's my dad.
- Come on, you guys!

29:49.732 --> 29:50.799
We're runnin' late!

29:50.833 --> 29:51.468
You're late.

29:51.501 --> 29:53.035
We were early.

29:54.103 --> 29:55.472
We can't get in a locked van.

29:55.505 --> 29:56.906
Hey, we heard you're
gonna get crucified.

29:56.939 --> 29:58.240
That's awesome!

29:58.274 --> 29:59.308
How did you...

29:59.341 --> 30:00.242
- I'm not-
- Word travels fast.

30:00.276 --> 30:01.310
Is it gonna be biblical?

30:01.343 --> 30:02.745
Yeah, you're gonna be naked?

30:02.778 --> 30:03.946
My mom would go to
church see that.

30:03.979 --> 30:05.448
No one's getting crucified,

30:05.482 --> 30:07.417
and definitely, no
one's getting naked!

30:07.450 --> 30:08.385
I'd do it.

30:08.418 --> 30:10.286
I do anything God wanted me to.

30:10.319 --> 30:12.489
Jesus was enough,
don't you think?

30:12.522 --> 30:15.925
Can you just get everyone
in the van, please?

30:15.958 --> 30:16.759
Oh, sorry.

30:22.031 --> 30:23.866
Wow, you really
shut that down.

30:23.899 --> 30:24.833
Well, that's
what you have to do

30:24.867 --> 30:26.368
with these kids sometimes.

30:26.403 --> 30:29.171
And that's exactly what
you have to do with my dad.

30:30.806 --> 30:31.675
You remember that
time my dad was gonna

30:31.707 --> 30:33.809
live in a plexiglass
box for three days

30:33.842 --> 30:34.944
if we filled two
shipping containers

30:34.977 --> 30:36.946
with Christmas sweaters?

30:36.979 --> 30:39.982
You must remember that,
'cause you stopped it.

30:40.015 --> 30:41.418
It was a long time ago.

30:42.885 --> 30:44.387
What happened to you?

30:44.421 --> 30:45.754
Me?

30:45.788 --> 30:47.756
Your dad is the one
with the gimmicks.

30:47.790 --> 30:50.427
Says the beach ball guy.

30:50.460 --> 30:54.096
I'm sorry, but you
used to push back.

30:54.129 --> 30:55.532
You seem to think

30:55.565 --> 30:58.100
I have the same influence
as your father here.

30:58.133 --> 30:58.767
I don't.

31:02.371 --> 31:05.241
You had a big influence on me.

31:05.274 --> 31:07.343
You once said,
"We're all sent,

31:07.376 --> 31:09.979
the only question is where".

31:10.012 --> 31:13.315
That's why I went to
Moldova in the first place,

31:13.349 --> 31:15.317
and I learned so much,

31:15.351 --> 31:20.022
and the only person I could
think to share with was you.

31:22.024 --> 31:23.025
Didn't you have a boyfriend

31:23.058 --> 31:25.428
or a fiance somewhere in there?

31:25.462 --> 31:28.465
- Ah, come on!
- You blew it, man!

31:28.498 --> 31:31.967
Let's talk later when
it's less dramatic.

31:32.001 --> 31:32.835
Don't worry about it.

31:32.868 --> 31:34.169
I'm done talking.

31:34.203 --> 31:35.405
Fine!

31:35.438 --> 31:36.872
Let's go minister
at the shelter.

31:36.905 --> 31:37.906
Let's go minister

31:37.940 --> 31:38.575
- at the shelter then.
- Hey!

31:38.608 --> 31:40.009
Amen.

31:40.042 --> 31:43.846
Brother.

31:43.879 --> 31:45.814
Ow, quit it.

31:45.848 --> 31:47.916
Come on, guys, buckle up.

31:47.950 --> 31:49.318
Maybe you should
team up with Tino?

31:49.351 --> 31:51.320
You know, Skip would love that.

31:51.353 --> 31:53.390
Right now, Tino
sounds better than you.

31:53.423 --> 31:54.557
He always sounds better.

31:54.591 --> 31:55.824
He sings.

31:55.858 --> 31:56.925
I'm just disappointed.

31:56.959 --> 31:58.227
I wish you would do your job.

31:58.260 --> 31:59.995
I am currently doing my job!

32:00.029 --> 32:01.230
Hold on, guys!

32:05.267 --> 32:06.268
Great.

32:06.302 --> 32:07.069
Well.

32:07.102 --> 32:08.605
No, no, no, no, no!

32:11.106 --> 32:11.907

32:13.876 --> 32:14.910
Tessi, are you okay, baby?

32:14.943 --> 32:16.078
There's no damage at all.

32:16.111 --> 32:17.012
It's not even smudged.

32:17.046 --> 32:17.946
How do you even know?

32:17.980 --> 32:19.181
I mean, it could be internally

32:19.214 --> 32:20.849
- hurting right now.
- I can see it.

32:20.883 --> 32:22.084
There is...

32:22.117 --> 32:23.252
It's
like they kissed.

32:23.285 --> 32:24.320
- Yeah, sure.
- Our bumpers

32:24.353 --> 32:25.354
- high fived.
- Yeah, sure.

32:25.388 --> 32:26.188
No.

32:26.221 --> 32:27.390
Oh, what a bummer.

32:27.424 --> 32:29.325
You guys were finally
starting to gel.

32:29.358 --> 32:30.460
We were arguing.

32:30.493 --> 32:34.963
Yeah, but you were both
mad about the same thing.

32:36.165 --> 32:38.601
Oh, by the stars of
Liza Minnelli.

32:38.635 --> 32:41.036
My car insurance guy
is gonna blow a gasket.

32:41.070 --> 32:43.606
You don't call insurance
when there's no damage.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.374
That's the dumb...

32:47.343 --> 32:48.977
You're brilliant!

32:51.681 --> 32:54.249
It's awkward, but comforting.

32:56.453 --> 32:57.620
Thanks!

33:01.323 --> 33:03.092
Man, that went
surprisingly well.

33:03.125 --> 33:04.527
Yeah.

33:04.561 --> 33:06.328
The shelter gives us all a
little perspective, doesn't it?

33:06.362 --> 33:09.031
Yeah, it's a work in progress.

33:10.433 --> 33:12.901
That was quite a
hug you gave Tino.

33:12.935 --> 33:15.037
Yes, the insurance guy.

33:16.939 --> 33:18.408
You're not on trackin'
with me, are ya?

33:18.441 --> 33:20.643
Apparently not.

33:20.677 --> 33:22.077
Tomorrow morning, I'm
gonna pay a little visit

33:22.111 --> 33:24.113
to the church's insurance guy.

33:24.146 --> 33:25.515
He may have some strong opinions

33:25.548 --> 33:27.015
about nailing someone to a cross

33:27.049 --> 33:29.985
from a liability standpoint.

33:30.018 --> 33:31.120
You're a genius.

33:31.153 --> 33:33.255
That's what I've been saying.

33:33.288 --> 33:34.424
I have an idea too.

33:34.457 --> 33:35.257
I love it!

33:35.290 --> 33:36.191
Let's do it.

33:36.225 --> 33:37.126
Don't you wanna hear it first?

33:37.159 --> 33:37.926
Sure, then let's do it.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.629
Okay.

33:39.662 --> 33:42.532
I think I can talk
some sense into Tino.

33:42.565 --> 33:44.099
That seems unlikely.

33:44.133 --> 33:45.067
If he's on our side,

33:45.100 --> 33:46.268
we can be a unified front

33:46.301 --> 33:49.138
and talk my dad out
of this madness.

33:49.171 --> 33:51.073
You're a genius.

33:51.106 --> 33:52.941
That's what I've been saying.

33:55.378 --> 33:57.447
Hey, remember when
you guys almost kissed?

33:57.480 --> 33:58.947
Blaise, can you back in,

33:58.981 --> 33:59.849
back in your seat please?

33:59.883 --> 34:01.718
But I can't hear
you guys back there.

34:05.254 --> 34:07.122
I am shocked and appalled.

34:07.156 --> 34:08.625
This is just outrageous.

34:08.658 --> 34:11.360
I have never run
out a mints before.

34:11.393 --> 34:12.293
It's fine.

34:12.327 --> 34:13.429
I don't need a mint, Mort.

34:13.463 --> 34:15.697
What about the
crucifixion situation?

34:15.732 --> 34:16.666
Right, right, right.

34:16.699 --> 34:18.367
Well, this is the first
I'm hearing about it,

34:18.400 --> 34:19.636
but I can assure you,

34:19.668 --> 34:21.438
that I will check
into this post-haste.

34:21.471 --> 34:22.505
Good.

34:22.539 --> 34:25.072
Yeah, I'm gonna pour
over your current policy,

34:25.107 --> 34:27.275
and it's extremely unlikely

34:27.309 --> 34:29.978
that we would cover
something like this, but...

34:30.012 --> 34:31.481
Well, in fact,

34:31.514 --> 34:34.016
even waiver forms create some
massive liability problems.

34:34.049 --> 34:36.051
That's what I've
been telling them.

34:36.083 --> 34:37.119
Okay, thank you, Mort.

34:37.152 --> 34:38.353
- I just-
- Okay.

34:38.388 --> 34:39.755
Well, we just want our
clients to be happy.

34:39.789 --> 34:41.223
Appreciate it.

34:41.255 --> 34:43.257
In fact, I'm gonna
send you some mints.

34:45.462 --> 34:46.563

was at the church.

37:38.968 --> 37:40.369
I'm seeing television shows.

I just want the church to
get back to the Gospel.

37:53.348 --> 37:53.916
Right.

37:53.950 --> 37:55.250
You know what?

37:55.283 --> 37:56.753
Okay, the church is whacked.

37:56.786 --> 37:58.286
I hear ya.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.188
And I'm gonna be
completely honest with you.

38:00.222 --> 38:01.424
I agree.

38:01.457 --> 38:02.692
But the problem is,

38:02.725 --> 38:03.893
you're trying to get
your message across.

38:03.926 --> 38:04.727
The Gospel.

38:04.761 --> 38:05.962
Right, right, right,

38:05.995 --> 38:06.863
and ain't nobody
listenin' to that.

38:06.896 --> 38:08.230
Yeah, that's exactly
what's happening.

38:08.263 --> 38:09.832
Do you wanna know why?

38:09.866 --> 38:10.967
You left your platform

38:11.000 --> 38:13.403
to go preach on someone
else's platform.

38:13.436 --> 38:16.271
Sand Hills Church
is Skip's stage now.

38:16.304 --> 38:18.240
It's just that simple.

38:18.273 --> 38:18.975
Yeah, and I'm frightened.

38:19.008 --> 38:19.976
You're making sense to me.

38:20.009 --> 38:21.477
But yeah, I see that.

38:21.511 --> 38:23.311
You wanna here
somethin' crazy?

38:23.345 --> 38:26.749
Best way to show this is a
bad idea is to just do it.

38:26.783 --> 38:28.518
So you're saying,

38:28.551 --> 38:30.820
I should go through
with this stupid idea

38:30.853 --> 38:33.456
just so I can tell everyone
it's a stupid idea?

38:33.489 --> 38:34.657
Yeah!

38:34.691 --> 38:36.426
Someone's gotta stick
up for the Gospel!

38:39.429 --> 38:40.930

and think it over.

38:40.963 --> 38:43.365

38:47.269 --> 38:48.738
What are you talking about?

38:48.771 --> 38:50.238
Well, they're on a date.

38:50.272 --> 38:51.507
Right now?

38:51.541 --> 38:52.307
Yeah, right now,
they're on a date.

38:53.009 --> 38:53.943
You didn't know?

38:53.976 --> 38:57.245
I feel like I
let the cat out the bag.

38:57.279 --> 38:59.849
The crazy thing is,
the whole church knows,

38:59.882 --> 39:01.451
and they've been...

39:03.351 --> 39:04.954
Hey, do me a favor!

39:04.987 --> 39:07.322
So you'll think about it?

39:07.355 --> 39:09.959
Guy, do me a favor,
and pray on this, bruh.

39:09.992 --> 39:13.396
This could be beneficial
for all parties involved!

39:13.429 --> 39:15.765
Including me and my 20%.

39:15.798 --> 39:17.365

No, no, but you're doing

Hi, kids.

39:46.996 --> 39:48.464
Hi, Guy.

39:48.498 --> 39:49.599
What are you doin' here?

39:49.632 --> 39:51.299
I need to borrow Carla.

39:51.333 --> 39:53.836
Listen, where we're actually
in the middle of a date.

39:53.870 --> 39:54.904
It's an errand.

39:54.937 --> 39:57.305
Hey, I don't wanna come
between you two kids,

39:57.339 --> 39:59.075
and the happiness I
feel in the air here,

39:59.108 --> 40:01.376
which is electric,

40:01.410 --> 40:03.679
but there's been an emergency.

40:03.713 --> 40:04.714
An emergency?

40:04.747 --> 40:06.415
Well, there's a girl,

40:06.449 --> 40:08.017
obviously, I can't
tell you her name,

40:08.050 --> 40:10.920
but she got herself into a jam,

40:10.953 --> 40:14.791
and I have to counsel
this poor, confused soul

40:16.559 --> 40:18.995
who's just crying out for help.

40:19.028 --> 40:20.863
It's right here in the text.

40:20.897 --> 40:23.699
And I can't do
that without Carla.

40:25.067 --> 40:26.402
Oh, but I...

40:28.070 --> 40:30.039
I just sing our order.

40:30.072 --> 40:31.474
You know, if this was
a musical emergency,

40:31.507 --> 40:32.608
I would call you.

40:32.642 --> 40:34.110
We all would.

40:34.143 --> 40:36.112
You know what?

40:36.145 --> 40:36.946
You're right.

40:36.979 --> 40:38.548
And when you're
right, you're right.

40:38.581 --> 40:39.415
If you
call me, I would go.

40:39.448 --> 40:40.483
- Thanks, Tino.
- Yeah.

40:40.516 --> 40:42.852
Sorry I ruined your plans.

40:44.453 --> 40:45.922
You know what they
say about plans?

40:45.955 --> 40:47.890
- What do they say about-
- Gotta go.

40:47.924 --> 40:48.724
All right.

40:48.758 --> 40:49.559
Right this way.

40:49.592 --> 40:50.760
Okay.

40:50.793 --> 40:54.463
Maybe one day you'll
tell me about the plans?

40:54.497 --> 40:55.398
Thank you for this food,

40:55.431 --> 40:57.066
bless Mabel, keep her safe,

40:57.099 --> 40:58.134
in Christ's name I pray.

40:58.167 --> 40:59.367
- Amen.
- Amen.

41:01.103 --> 41:02.772
I forgot about Mabel.

41:02.805 --> 41:06.843
You used to pray for
her in youth group.

41:06.876 --> 41:08.845
You never told us who she was.

41:08.878 --> 41:10.746
No, I never did.

41:10.780 --> 41:12.481
I see.

41:12.515 --> 41:15.084
Well, thank you for saving me
from the phantom of the Tino.

41:15.117 --> 41:16.018
Nice.

41:16.052 --> 41:18.353
I'd much rather be on this.

41:20.890 --> 41:22.925
Were you about to say date?

41:22.959 --> 41:24.026
No.

41:24.060 --> 41:26.596
No, I was gonna say, excursion.

41:28.030 --> 41:30.566
Technically, you're
still on a date with Tino.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.734
Yes, exactly.

41:33.169 --> 41:35.605
And I'm having a
much better time now.

41:36.906 --> 41:38.074
Let me know if he
gets a second date,

41:38.107 --> 41:40.743
and I'll bring some
cash next time.

41:40.776 --> 41:43.045
Thanks for dinner.

41:43.079 --> 41:44.513
You're welcome.

41:45.648 --> 41:48.951
I never talked to Tino
about Good Friday.

41:48.985 --> 41:50.119
Don't worry about it.

41:50.152 --> 41:53.155
Pastor Skip, he can't find
a volunteer to do it anyway.

41:53.189 --> 41:56.158
You know my dad,
he won't give up.

41:56.192 --> 41:58.160
Talked to the
insurance guy today.

41:58.194 --> 42:00.596
Let's just say,
he's very concerned.

42:00.630 --> 42:01.464
Really?

42:02.498 --> 42:04.734
Well, look at you.

42:04.767 --> 42:05.935
Didn't buy me dinner,

42:05.968 --> 42:07.536
but you talked to the
insurance guy, so.

42:07.570 --> 42:09.171
Let's just relax,

42:09.205 --> 42:10.606
and enjoy the rest of
you date with Tino.

42:11.874 --> 42:14.210
Just don't sing to me.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.228
Are you Guy Sides?

42:32.261 --> 42:33.462
I am.

42:33.496 --> 42:34.530
How can I help you?

42:34.563 --> 42:36.599
You could start by
explaining some stuff to me.

42:36.632 --> 42:37.867
You know, I mean,
I've had a lot of time

42:37.900 --> 42:40.836
to think about this,
and how I'd say it.

42:40.870 --> 42:41.771
Just spit it out,

42:41.804 --> 42:44.206
that's always the easiest way.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.841
Okay.

42:45.875 --> 42:47.476
I'm your daughter.

42:50.246 --> 42:52.014
Mabel?

42:52.048 --> 42:52.982
Mabel?

42:53.015 --> 42:54.784
My name's Gretchen.

42:54.817 --> 42:56.686
You have a daughter
named Mabel too?

42:56.719 --> 42:57.653
No, I just...

42:57.687 --> 42:58.988
I didn't know your name.

43:02.291 --> 43:02.925
Why?

43:04.026 --> 43:04.994
You know, that's why I'm here.

43:05.027 --> 43:06.529
I'm curious.

43:06.562 --> 43:09.732
Your mom and I give
you up for adoption.

43:09.765 --> 43:12.001
You wanna try that again?

43:14.136 --> 43:16.639
I don't know what to say.

43:16.672 --> 43:18.107
I believed it was the
right thing to do,

43:18.140 --> 43:20.509
- but I still feel-
- Guilty?

43:21.277 --> 43:22.979
I wouldn't say guilty.

43:23.012 --> 43:26.148
Regret for not being
there, I guess.

43:26.182 --> 43:28.517
But I'm happy you're here now.

43:28.551 --> 43:30.119
Really?

43:30.152 --> 43:31.587
You're not gonna get
booted outta here

43:31.620 --> 43:33.823
for having me out of wedlock?

43:35.324 --> 43:40.529
No, but
thank you for asking.

43:40.930 --> 43:41.797
I get it.

43:42.965 --> 43:45.301
You got a pretty sweet
deal goin' on here.

43:45.334 --> 43:49.171
You don't want some
random kid screwin' it up.

43:50.906 --> 43:51.874
So I wanna know everything.

43:51.907 --> 43:53.242
Tell me about yourself.

43:53.275 --> 43:54.143
Who are your friends?

43:54.176 --> 43:55.177
What do you like?

43:55.211 --> 43:57.813
- What's your favorite-
- Stop!

43:57.847 --> 43:59.081
Why are you being nice?

43:59.115 --> 44:01.617
You can't be nice.

44:01.650 --> 44:03.552
Aren't I messing up your life?

44:03.586 --> 44:05.888
Messing up my life?

44:05.921 --> 44:06.856
I've been prayin'
for this moment

44:06.889 --> 44:09.125
since before you were born.

44:11.594 --> 44:12.628
Look, I have an idea.

44:12.661 --> 44:13.629
Can we get some coffee?

44:17.600 --> 44:20.603
Yeah, we can
start with coffee.

44:25.074 --> 44:27.576

More, more halo.

44:31.647 --> 44:32.715

44:33.916 --> 44:34.717
Thanks.

44:34.750 --> 44:35.651
Hey!

44:35.684 --> 44:36.318
Guy Sides!

44:36.352 --> 44:37.987
How's it goin'?

44:38.020 --> 44:40.222
I see that you're hiding
another beautiful lady from me.

44:40.256 --> 44:41.590
How you doin'?

44:41.624 --> 44:43.225
My name is Tino
Carmino, and your are?

44:43.259 --> 44:44.360
My daughter.

44:44.394 --> 44:46.095
- My name is-
- You have a daughter?

44:46.128 --> 44:47.296
Gretchen!

44:47.329 --> 44:48.230
- Nice to meet you.
- Well, we'll let you-

44:48.264 --> 44:51.801
We'll let you get back
to your vanity cam.

44:56.406 --> 44:59.675
So what happened
with you guys?

44:59.708 --> 45:02.111
Well, it was our
last year of college.

45:02.144 --> 45:04.947
The relationship was over.

45:04.980 --> 45:06.383
About a month later,
your mom came to me

45:06.416 --> 45:08.050
and told me she was pregnant,

45:08.084 --> 45:10.352
and she thought we should
give the baby up for adoption,

45:10.387 --> 45:13.089
and I agreed it would be best.

45:15.658 --> 45:16.759
The baby?

45:17.427 --> 45:18.395
That would be me?

45:18.428 --> 45:21.130
Yeah, you were the baby.

45:21.163 --> 45:23.732
We gave you up for adoption.

45:23.766 --> 45:26.969
Well, except she didn't
give me up for adoption.

45:27.002 --> 45:28.137
What?

45:28.170 --> 45:29.839
She kept the baby.

45:31.674 --> 45:35.244
Congratulations,
it's a girl!

45:42.885 --> 45:45.821
Pastor Guy and the lovely
Gretchen together at last.

45:45.855 --> 45:47.123
Did I
tell you my name?

45:47.156 --> 45:48.757
He does That.

45:48.791 --> 45:49.758
Let's take a picture.

45:50.993 --> 45:52.128
Ikky background,
move this way.

45:52.161 --> 45:53.095
Chad, we're on our way out,

45:53.129 --> 45:53.929
- so-
- Just take a second.

45:53.963 --> 45:55.364
Over here, this...

45:55.398 --> 45:56.665
Beautiful.

45:56.699 --> 45:58.234
And back it up a little bit.

45:58.267 --> 45:59.068
A little bit.

46:00.470 --> 46:01.404
Perfect.

46:01.438 --> 46:02.771
Great.

46:02.805 --> 46:05.641
- One, two, three.
- Chad, what are you-

46:06.742 --> 46:08.744
- One more step, Pastor Guy.

46:08.777 --> 46:12.248
Four, and say, cheese.

46:13.383 --> 46:14.451
I'm so sorry.

46:14.484 --> 46:15.718
Are you okay?

46:15.751 --> 46:16.453
I'm fine.

46:16.486 --> 46:17.186
Are you all right, Blaise?

46:17.219 --> 46:18.120
I'm great!

46:18.154 --> 46:19.755
This is the best day of my life.

46:19.788 --> 46:21.424
Well, to be fair,
that's every day for you.

46:21.458 --> 46:23.460
Yeah, but this is a big one.

46:23.493 --> 46:26.061
It's like the most
exciting day ever!

46:26.095 --> 46:28.465
I'm gonna be crucified.

46:28.498 --> 46:29.932
Isn't that great?

46:38.475 --> 46:42.311
Did he just say, he's
gonna be crucified?

46:42.344 --> 46:43.480
Hey, I gotta go kill someone,

46:43.513 --> 46:45.981
but do you wanna spend the
rest of the afternoon together?

46:46.015 --> 46:46.815
- Sure.
- All right.

46:46.849 --> 46:47.450
I won't be long.

46:47.484 --> 46:50.853
Just gotta.

46:52.321 --> 46:55.492
You guys aren't big on the
Ten Commandments here, huh?

46:55.525 --> 46:57.394
Funny, I just read
somewhere recently

46:57.427 --> 46:59.929
that sarcasm could be genetic.

47:01.498 --> 47:04.733
I'm not gonna let you do this.

47:04.767 --> 47:05.801
Okay.

47:07.369 --> 47:08.971
Give me an alternative.

47:09.004 --> 47:09.805
I don't know.

47:09.838 --> 47:11.040
Kick it old school.

47:11.073 --> 47:12.409
Preach on the death and
resurrection of Jesus.

47:12.442 --> 47:13.976
Hmm, riveting.

47:14.009 --> 47:16.779
We're competing against a
lot of noise out there, Guy.

47:16.812 --> 47:19.782
It's all chats, and tweets,
and bleeps, and blurps.

47:19.815 --> 47:20.749
Blurps?

47:20.783 --> 47:24.286
We've gotta grab their
attention and hold it!

47:24.320 --> 47:29.325
Maybe we could get some noisy
gongs and clanging symbols?

47:29.792 --> 47:30.393
Fun.

47:31.093 --> 47:32.861
I know you're offended by this,

47:32.895 --> 47:34.863
but God made me an entrepreneur,

47:34.897 --> 47:37.299
and I could have used that
gift to build a corporation,

47:37.333 --> 47:39.402
but I've chosen to
build His kingdom.

47:39.436 --> 47:42.938
Skip, I am not
questioning your motives.

47:44.807 --> 47:47.343
I'm concerned
about your methods.

47:47.376 --> 47:51.814
The board, the staff,
me, we all agree with me.

47:51.847 --> 47:53.115
History is filled with

47:53.148 --> 47:56.318
large groups of
people who were wrong.

47:57.186 --> 47:59.489
Look, brother, I love you.

47:59.522 --> 48:02.157
We've been through the
trenches together for years.

48:02.191 --> 48:05.894
I wonder if maybe you're being
called to different work?

48:05.928 --> 48:08.764
I see.

48:12.835 --> 48:15.337
Well, you do whatever
you have to do,

48:15.371 --> 48:19.275
and I'll do whatever I
have to do to stop this.

48:35.257 --> 48:36.593
Come on, Gretch-eon!

48:36.626 --> 48:38.360
Your team needs you.

48:38.395 --> 48:40.929
I didn't think laser tag
was cool even when it was.

48:40.963 --> 48:43.098
You know, laser tag is
making a big comeback.

48:43.132 --> 48:44.933
So is West Nile virus.

48:44.967 --> 48:46.403
Come on.

48:46.436 --> 48:50.540
All you need to do is look
down this scope thingy

48:50.573 --> 48:52.007
and pull the trigger.

48:52.041 --> 48:53.175
Got you!

48:54.343 --> 48:55.512
Come on, Pastor Guy.

48:55.545 --> 48:56.345
We need you.

48:56.379 --> 48:57.179
Come on!

48:57.212 --> 48:58.515
Cover me, Gretchen.

49:01.984 --> 49:03.486
You seem a little mature
to be in youth group.

49:04.953 --> 49:07.590
I'm not in it,
I'm just near it.

49:09.958 --> 49:10.859
Like what?

49:10.893 --> 49:11.594
A volunteer?

49:12.662 --> 49:14.863
No, I'm here with Guy.

49:17.032 --> 49:18.334
Is that right?

49:20.269 --> 49:22.871
You must be a little concerned
about his age, though?

49:23.906 --> 49:25.140
I don't know.

49:25.174 --> 49:29.044
I mean, I guess he could
be a little bit older.

49:31.980 --> 49:34.350
Sounds like you
have daddy issues.

49:37.219 --> 49:40.222
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

49:41.357 --> 49:42.991
Why are you here?

49:45.294 --> 49:47.229
Same reason, I guess.

49:48.097 --> 49:50.400
Guy is your dad too?

49:50.433 --> 49:52.000
Mabel?

49:52.034 --> 49:53.068
Why does everyone
keep calling me that?

49:53.102 --> 49:54.370
Wait, your Guy's daughter?

49:54.404 --> 49:55.938
Yeah, but my name's Gretchen.

49:57.106 --> 49:57.906
Gretchen.

49:57.940 --> 49:59.942
My name's Gretchen.

49:59.975 --> 50:02.311
I'm so glad you're here.

50:02.344 --> 50:05.013
Guy's been praying
for you forever.

50:05.047 --> 50:06.683
Who are you?

50:06.716 --> 50:09.118
Carla, Pastor Skip's daughter,

50:09.151 --> 50:10.986
and Guy's...

50:11.019 --> 50:11.920
I don't know.

50:12.988 --> 50:13.889
Cool.

50:13.922 --> 50:17.259
I didn't realize he
had an "I don't know".

50:18.260 --> 50:19.128
Come on, you guys!

50:19.161 --> 50:20.329
We've got trouble.

50:20.362 --> 50:21.698
Back, to back, to back.

50:51.326 --> 50:52.462
So we're in this
together, right?

50:52.495 --> 50:53.962
Definitely, Semper Phi.

50:53.996 --> 50:56.031
Hey, can you pop the trunk?

50:56.064 --> 50:56.699
Nice shoe.

50:56.733 --> 50:58.000
Yeah, whatever.

50:58.033 --> 50:59.234
All right.

50:59.268 --> 51:01.003
Operation Stop Skip is a go.

51:01.036 --> 51:03.005
Phase One: I'll
check back with Mort.

51:03.038 --> 51:04.441
Well, I still haven't
given up on Tino.

51:04.474 --> 51:05.274
Oh, good.

51:05.307 --> 51:06.476
That's Phase Two.

51:06.509 --> 51:07.142
Play that out,
see where it goes.

51:07.176 --> 51:08.076
Marriage?

51:08.110 --> 51:09.044
Not that far.

51:09.077 --> 51:11.714
Phase Three: I'll talk
to Blaise's parents.

51:11.748 --> 51:13.148
Carla, I could use
your help with that.

51:13.182 --> 51:14.016
Yeah, of course.

51:14.049 --> 51:15.050
What about me?

51:15.083 --> 51:15.984
What's my phase?

51:16.018 --> 51:17.986
Phase Four: call your mom.

51:18.020 --> 51:19.021
I'm not ready for that.

51:19.054 --> 51:19.955
I'm really mad at her.

51:19.988 --> 51:24.126
I know, that's why
there's a Phase Four.

51:24.159 --> 51:25.395
Hey.

51:25.428 --> 51:28.465
Guy Sides, I pray he
finds his repentance,

51:28.498 --> 51:30.299
and finds forgiveness.

51:33.202 --> 51:35.204
Why are we meeting
in the Prayer Room?

51:35.237 --> 51:37.774
We both have really
cool offices.

51:37.807 --> 51:38.842
I know, I Just
thought I'd have this

51:38.875 --> 51:42.211
difficult conversation
in an attitude of prayer.

51:42.244 --> 51:43.513
Right.

51:43.546 --> 51:45.147
- Good call.
- Yeah.

51:47.417 --> 51:49.452
You know Guy has a daughter?

51:49.486 --> 51:50.720
I know.

51:50.753 --> 51:52.354
I've been praying
for her for years.

51:52.388 --> 51:53.756
Well, she just showed up.

51:53.790 --> 51:56.225
- Mabel, here?
- Yeah.

51:56.258 --> 51:57.059
No way!

51:57.092 --> 51:58.360
That's awesome.

51:59.529 --> 52:00.797
But he's isn't
married, you know?

52:00.830 --> 52:03.065
I had my suspicions.

52:03.733 --> 52:06.134
Well, you and I, you know,

52:06.168 --> 52:07.670
we gotta lot of
grace for people.

52:07.704 --> 52:12.408
Just not so sure everybody's
gonna be as understanding.

52:12.442 --> 52:17.279
And it's probably going to be
upsetting to certain people.

52:20.148 --> 52:22.050
Thanks, Tino.

52:22.084 --> 52:23.151
Let's keep this between us,

52:23.185 --> 52:25.455
but you've been a big help.

52:26.623 --> 52:28.123
Thank you.

52:28.156 --> 52:28.825
I know.

52:28.858 --> 52:30.125
Shh, shh.

52:33.195 --> 52:35.163
Thank you.

52:42.204 --> 52:45.508
I think it is so cool that
you're talking to my parents.

52:45.542 --> 52:46.643
Blaise, that's great.

52:46.676 --> 52:48.210
I was nervous you'd be upset.

52:48.243 --> 52:50.813
Nah, the Cameron
family doesn't get upset.

52:50.847 --> 52:52.849
That may change today

52:52.882 --> 52:55.250
once I tell 'em what's going on.

52:55.284 --> 52:57.587
They're gonna be
really upset, Blaise.

52:57.620 --> 52:59.121
Wow.

52:59.154 --> 53:00.590
My parents upset.

53:04.326 --> 53:05.160
Awesome.

53:07.497 --> 53:09.097
Wait, I live here.

53:15.237 --> 53:16.138
Try this.

53:16.171 --> 53:18.240
It stimulates brain waves.

53:18.273 --> 53:19.274
Thank you.

53:23.546 --> 53:25.815
I already feel it working.

53:25.848 --> 53:27.884
Anyway, those
are just 10 reasons

53:27.917 --> 53:30.386
why Blaise shouldn't
be crucified.

53:30.420 --> 53:34.156
You make a compelling
case, I must say.

53:34.189 --> 53:35.290
And I wanna affirm you in that,

53:35.324 --> 53:36.893
the same way we affirm Blaise

53:36.926 --> 53:39.662
in whatever makes him happy.

53:39.696 --> 53:42.297
I just wish there was
something we could do.

53:51.507 --> 53:53.476
You're his parents?

53:53.509 --> 53:55.545
That's right.

53:55.578 --> 53:58.514
So you could tell him no.

54:02.552 --> 54:05.354
Obviously, you
don't have children.

54:05.388 --> 54:06.456
Not yet.

54:06.489 --> 54:07.924
No.

54:07.957 --> 54:11.226
We foster a "yes"
environment here,

54:12.395 --> 54:15.565
a positive posture
toward the universe.

54:15.598 --> 54:16.399
I'm hungry.

54:16.432 --> 54:18.233
Anybody want toast?

54:18.868 --> 54:19.702
Sure.

54:21.871 --> 54:23.706
Isn't he a delight?

54:23.740 --> 54:26.375
We didn't teach him that.

54:26.409 --> 54:29.144
Offering toast
comes from within.

54:31.981 --> 54:33.449
Interesting.

54:33.483 --> 54:34.316
Yeah.

54:35.518 --> 54:37.787
Can we get back to
the conversation?

54:37.820 --> 54:40.857
Blaise is going to be crucified.

54:40.890 --> 54:43.459
You make it sound so negative.

54:43.493 --> 54:44.727
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron,

54:44.761 --> 54:47.229
crucifixion is not
a positive thing.

54:47.262 --> 54:49.231
- It's a horrible-
- Nah, nu-uh-uh.

54:49.264 --> 54:50.600
Not necessarily.

54:51.534 --> 54:53.201
Doesn't your religion contend,

54:53.235 --> 54:56.906
that Jesus paid for your
sins through crucifixion?

54:58.340 --> 55:00.810
- Yeah, but-
- So it is positive.

55:01.778 --> 55:04.212
- Mm-hmm.
- I've changed my mind!

55:04.246 --> 55:06.281
I'm having grilled cheese.

55:06.314 --> 55:09.284
You always make
great choices, sweetie.

55:10.987 --> 55:13.756
So wait, let me make sure
I'm hearing this correctly.

55:13.790 --> 55:15.992
You're gonna allow
him to do this?

55:16.025 --> 55:19.227
Well, you're still
not getting it, dear.

55:19.261 --> 55:21.898
We don't allow him
to do anything.

55:23.365 --> 55:24.867
We don't own him.

55:24.901 --> 55:28.236
But you're
responsible for him.

55:28.270 --> 55:29.872
You could parent him.

55:29.906 --> 55:31.708
Well, that's a
very novel concept,

55:31.741 --> 55:35.478
but that's just not
how we see ourselves.

55:35.511 --> 55:37.245
We're just all here together,

55:37.279 --> 55:40.016
you know, like
good, older friends.

55:40.049 --> 55:41.417
Right, Blaise?

55:41.451 --> 55:42.719
Right, Alice.

55:50.760 --> 55:53.261
It's your job to teach
Blaise how to live.

55:53.295 --> 55:57.533
Maybe you could start by
preventing him from dying.

56:09.979 --> 56:12.014
Good talk, guys.

56:14.884 --> 56:16.018
Coffee.

56:16.052 --> 56:18.421
Now, that stimulates
my brainwaves.

56:18.454 --> 56:19.689
Carla, focus!

56:20.857 --> 56:23.059
How are you not
freaking out right now?

56:23.092 --> 56:24.494
I know, I know.

56:24.527 --> 56:26.395
I'm just impressed.

56:26.429 --> 56:27.830
Impressed with what?

56:27.864 --> 56:29.565
With you.

56:29.599 --> 56:30.767
What are
you talking about?

56:30.800 --> 56:32.334
Blaise's parents didn't
hear a word I said.

56:32.367 --> 56:34.336
I know.

56:34.369 --> 56:36.939
They were not there, but I was.

56:36.973 --> 56:39.642
I heard you and I am impressed.

56:39.675 --> 56:41.376
Well, I am lost.

56:44.580 --> 56:47.717
I don't know what to do next.

56:47.750 --> 56:49.418
Robert, is my dad here?

56:49.452 --> 56:50.653
Is he napping?

56:50.686 --> 56:53.022
We are very blessed
here at Sand Hills.

56:53.055 --> 56:53.890
No, no.

56:55.357 --> 56:56.392
I think I look all right?

56:56.425 --> 56:57.894
That's what I would have done.

56:57.927 --> 56:59.361
Carla!

56:59.395 --> 57:00.563
My daughter, Carla.

57:00.596 --> 57:03.399
Carla, my precious
angel, how are you?

57:03.432 --> 57:06.068
Carla just got home from
serving the Lord overseas,

57:06.102 --> 57:08.104
and she is never leaving again.

57:09.839 --> 57:11.741
- Can we talk for just-
- Sure, they can walk with us.

57:11.774 --> 57:12.575
- Oh.
- No, no, no.

57:12.608 --> 57:13.810
Come on, walk with us.

57:13.843 --> 57:16.712
This reporter's
from MSMBSCN-SPAN.

57:16.746 --> 57:17.914
Oh, we can talk later.

57:17.947 --> 57:19.882
No, don't be silly.

57:19.916 --> 57:21.984
Look, I know what
this is all about.

57:22.018 --> 57:24.387
You found out about
Guy's illegitimate child

57:24.420 --> 57:25.621
and you are devastated.

57:25.655 --> 57:27.490
Correction, no,
she's wonderful,

57:27.523 --> 57:28.791
and Guy's really stepping up.

57:28.825 --> 57:30.026
- He's been-
- Honey, that's why

57:30.059 --> 57:30.960
I've been giving you
the hard sell on Tino.

57:30.993 --> 57:33.062
Just lookin' out for my peanut.

57:33.095 --> 57:36.799
Dad, listen, you have to
cancel this Good Friday stunt.

57:36.833 --> 57:39.035
You're making the cross of
Jesus into a freak show.

57:39.068 --> 57:41.103
Honey, if following
Jesus makes me a freak,

57:41.137 --> 57:43.906
then I'm about to
get super freaky.

57:43.940 --> 57:46.042
How very '80s of you.

57:46.075 --> 57:47.877
Look, the way I see it,

57:47.910 --> 57:51.647
we can talk about the crucifixion
for a few thousand people,

57:51.681 --> 57:53.916
or we can show the crucifixion

57:53.950 --> 57:56.452
for tens of millions of people.

57:56.485 --> 57:58.788
Don't you want
them to understand the Gospel?

57:58.821 --> 57:59.655
Honey, it's in there.

57:59.689 --> 58:00.590
Trust me.

58:00.623 --> 58:02.024
You bring 'em in with the show,

58:02.058 --> 58:04.894
and you give 'em a little
nibble of the truth.

58:04.927 --> 58:07.163
You have completely
lost your way.

58:07.196 --> 58:08.130
Don't be so dramatic, honey.

58:08.164 --> 58:10.633
That can push people away.

58:10.666 --> 58:11.968
Ooh,

58:12.001 --> 58:13.502
I like the rusty ones.

58:13.536 --> 58:15.004
They look so authentic.

58:15.037 --> 58:17.640
That's what I would've done.

58:17.673 --> 58:18.908
Here
at Sand Hills Church,

58:18.941 --> 58:21.177
we've always pressed the
boundaries of our faith.

58:21.210 --> 58:24.513
This Good Friday, we're
gonna have a crucifixion.

58:32.755 --> 58:35.057
- Carla?
- Chad, hi.

58:35.091 --> 58:37.727
I'm sorry, but can I
just have a second?

58:37.760 --> 58:38.594
Sure.

58:40.196 --> 58:43.499
I'm sorry, I'll
just be a second.

58:43.532 --> 58:46.535
Could I have a
Dixie cup, please?

58:46.569 --> 58:47.536
Yeah.

58:47.570 --> 58:48.304
Just one?

58:50.773 --> 58:52.708
- There you go, honey.
- Oh, thanks.

58:52.742 --> 58:54.644
So your day goin' okay?

58:56.112 --> 58:59.548
Well, not very well, actually-

58:59.582 --> 59:02.518
- And the pipe cleaners,
if you don't mind?

59:02.551 --> 59:03.152
Thanks.

59:05.488 --> 59:06.088
There you go.

59:06.122 --> 59:06.923
Great.

59:06.956 --> 59:08.057
Thank you so much.

59:08.090 --> 59:09.525
It seems to me,

59:09.558 --> 59:11.761
things are going rather
well around here, hmm?

59:11.794 --> 59:13.963
No, actually, they're not.

59:13.996 --> 59:16.766
I'm crying in a supply
closet ,

59:16.799 --> 59:19.535
so things are not
going very well.

59:19.568 --> 59:21.537
Wrapping paper?

59:21.570 --> 59:22.238
Yeah.

59:22.271 --> 59:23.973
- Oh.
- There it is.

59:25.608 --> 59:27.476
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

59:27.510 --> 59:28.744
I don't know.

59:28.778 --> 59:31.113
I mean, you're back,

59:31.147 --> 59:33.015
Guy's really focused
on the kids again,

59:33.049 --> 59:36.786
and your dad is super
excited about Good Friday.

59:36.819 --> 59:41.490
Yeah, he's planning
on crucifying some kid.

59:41.524 --> 59:42.692
Blaise?

59:42.725 --> 59:45.227
Oh, well, he's
not just some kid.

59:45.261 --> 59:47.163
He's quite special.

59:47.196 --> 59:48.864
I mean, he's Blaise.

59:50.900 --> 59:53.269
I wish I could see
it the way you do.

59:53.302 --> 59:54.236
You know, I just...

59:54.270 --> 59:55.504
I look around everything
that's happening here

59:55.538 --> 59:57.573
and I feel so hopeless.

59:57.606 --> 01:00:01.577
And that's where our
faith comes in, right?

01:00:03.946 --> 01:00:08.050
Have you ever heard the
word phototropism, Carla?

01:00:09.585 --> 01:00:10.686
No?

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.289
Oh.

01:00:13.322 --> 01:00:16.559
Phototropism, it's when a plant

01:00:16.592 --> 01:00:19.161
continuously keeps
reaching towards the light.

01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:20.763
No matter what you do to it,

01:00:20.796 --> 01:00:24.000
it'll just turn
itself right around,

01:00:24.033 --> 01:00:27.236
and keeps on reaching
toward the light.

01:00:28.337 --> 01:00:29.572
Phototropism.

01:00:38.347 --> 01:00:39.181
For you.

01:00:43.853 --> 01:00:46.122
Reach for the light, Carla.

01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:48.924
See ya.

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:49.592
Oh, sorry.

01:00:52.595 --> 01:00:55.264
Okay.

01:00:57.199 --> 01:01:00.569
Thanks, Chad.

01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:07.676
There he is.

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:10.312
Whatever it is,
I'm not interested.

01:01:10.346 --> 01:01:11.213
Oh, don't worry.

01:01:11.247 --> 01:01:13.949
I'm not here to talk
you into anything.

01:01:13.983 --> 01:01:15.217
You're not?

01:01:15.251 --> 01:01:17.753
No, actually, I'm here
to tell you face-to-face

01:01:17.787 --> 01:01:19.221
that I am releasing you.

01:01:19.255 --> 01:01:21.657
Yeah, you can do your thing.

01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:23.592
You're dropping
me as a client?

01:01:23.626 --> 01:01:24.226
Yes.

01:01:25.628 --> 01:01:28.697
I can't help you do
whatever this is, so.

01:01:30.266 --> 01:01:32.134
All right, well, that's fair.

01:01:32.168 --> 01:01:33.369
Well, thanks for
telling me in person.

01:01:33.403 --> 01:01:34.336
- Oh.
- All right?

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:35.371
No problem.

01:01:35.405 --> 01:01:36.338
No problem.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.841
Hey, I've got more good news,

01:01:38.874 --> 01:01:40.676

01:01:43.413 --> 01:01:47.316
Yeah, I already got him a
two book deal and a tour.

01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:48.584
You are what?

01:01:49.919 --> 01:01:52.655
Would you consider
praying about

01:01:52.688 --> 01:01:55.858

book by any...

01:01:55.891 --> 01:01:57.726

Aren't you a little
old to be a youth pastor?

01:02:23.453 --> 01:02:25.988
Well, a youth pastor just
means you're a pastor of youth,

01:02:26.021 --> 01:02:28.190
not a pastor who is young.

01:02:29.992 --> 01:02:31.894

God, I never laugh

01:02:47.776 --> 01:02:50.112
Yeah, have you called her?

01:02:51.247 --> 01:02:53.782
I'll never call her again.

01:02:54.984 --> 01:02:57.720
Look, your mom kept you
because she loves you.

01:02:57.753 --> 01:02:59.188
I know.

01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:01.991
And she kept me from
you because she loves you.

01:03:02.024 --> 01:03:03.225
I don't care why she did it.

01:03:03.259 --> 01:03:05.462
That wasn't her
decision to make.

01:03:05.495 --> 01:03:09.732
Gretchen, you're mad
at me, and for good reason,

01:03:09.765 --> 01:03:12.067
and now you're mad at your
mom, that's legit too,

01:03:12.101 --> 01:03:15.771
but there's always gonna
be someone to be angry at.

01:03:15.804 --> 01:03:16.939
Maybe.

01:03:16.972 --> 01:03:21.810
The only way out of that
infinite loop is forgiveness.

01:03:24.847 --> 01:03:25.881
Look, to be fair to your mom,

01:03:25.915 --> 01:03:27.016
I was not a good guy.

01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:28.451
I was a mess.

01:03:28.485 --> 01:03:32.154

good guy, right?

01:03:32.188 --> 01:03:35.157

01:08:03.793 --> 01:08:04.928
- What?
- Yeah.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.130
It's basically the same policy
we provide to Battlesack.

01:08:08.163 --> 01:08:10.065
And now we have it
thanks to you, Guy.

01:08:10.966 --> 01:08:13.703
Hey, listen, if
you guys need me,

01:08:13.736 --> 01:08:15.270
call me, okay?

01:08:15.304 --> 01:08:16.738
Enjoy those mints.

01:08:16.773 --> 01:08:20.042
All right, we'll
call, you know.

01:08:20.075 --> 01:08:21.109
Hey, step into my
office for a minute.

01:08:21.143 --> 01:08:23.212
- Let's have a chat.
- Yeah.

01:08:24.546 --> 01:08:26.113
I had to talk to Mort, you know.

01:08:26.148 --> 01:08:27.049
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:27.082 --> 01:08:29.452
This isn't about that.

01:08:29.486 --> 01:08:32.321
I have a great
opportunity for ya.

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:42.296
I just need you to sign this.

01:08:49.203 --> 01:08:52.475
This is a resignation
letter from me.

01:08:53.776 --> 01:08:55.645
And it breaks my heart,

01:08:55.678 --> 01:08:57.779
but I don't want Sand
Hills to keep you

01:08:57.814 --> 01:09:01.049
from the things that
are important to you,

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:03.520
and this is a chance for
you to do those things.

01:09:03.553 --> 01:09:04.720
What things?

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.492
Well, you would
know better than me,

01:09:09.526 --> 01:09:10.460
but you can do those things,

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:13.127
just as soon as you sign this.

01:09:13.161 --> 01:09:15.296
But I didn't write this.

01:09:16.533 --> 01:09:19.801
Yeah, I got it from a
template off of Google.

01:09:19.836 --> 01:09:22.237
The board isn't
gonna like this either.

01:09:22.270 --> 01:09:24.171
It was their idea, Guy.

01:09:24.206 --> 01:09:25.140
They think it's pretty important

01:09:25.173 --> 01:09:27.810
for the whole staff to
be on the same page.

01:09:27.844 --> 01:09:28.810
Your page.

01:09:29.879 --> 01:09:33.383
Look,
you should resign quietly

01:09:33.416 --> 01:09:35.718
before the scandal blows up.

01:09:35.752 --> 01:09:37.587
Crucifying, Blaise?

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.322
No, I'm talking about-

01:09:40.354 --> 01:09:42.189
- Gretchen?

01:09:42.224 --> 01:09:43.125
She's not a scandal!

01:09:43.158 --> 01:09:43.859
She's my daughter!

01:09:43.893 --> 01:09:45.127
Don't be mad at me, buddy.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.563
I'm trying to help you.

01:09:46.595 --> 01:09:47.796
You know how I feel.

01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:49.363
I've been praying with
you about her for years.

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:54.169
But the board's thinking
bigger picture on this.

01:09:54.202 --> 01:09:55.805
Think about it, Guy.

01:09:55.838 --> 01:09:58.340
A youth past of a
culture-shaping church

01:09:58.373 --> 01:10:00.309
has a child out of wedlock.

01:10:00.342 --> 01:10:03.111
Not everyone's gonna
be so grace-orient.

01:10:03.145 --> 01:10:04.581
So they're okay

01:10:04.614 --> 01:10:05.782
with a kid from the youth
group being crucified,

01:10:05.815 --> 01:10:07.650
but this is a scandal?

01:10:10.486 --> 01:10:11.788
Give me that pen.

01:10:14.156 --> 01:10:17.493
Oh, finally got a
use for your book.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.237
Hey, Skip, how did the board
find out about Gretchen anyway?

01:10:31.708 --> 01:10:34.242
That's what I thought.

01:10:36.446 --> 01:10:39.181
♪ And our friendship
is not one but two ♪

01:10:39.214 --> 01:10:43.453
♪ 'Cause our love
is totally awesome ♪

01:10:45.354 --> 01:10:46.188
Perfect!

01:10:49.626 --> 01:10:51.794
Well, you finally
outgrew your toys?

01:10:51.828 --> 01:10:53.763
Yeah, and Sand Hills.

01:10:54.797 --> 01:10:56.399
What?

01:10:56.432 --> 01:10:57.600
I just quit.

01:10:58.568 --> 01:10:59.535
What?

01:10:59.569 --> 01:11:01.303
Well, I was fired.

01:11:01.336 --> 01:11:03.706
I was given the
opportunity to resign.

01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:06.174
Whatever, I'm done here.

01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:08.878
So you're
just giving up?

01:11:08.911 --> 01:11:10.647
You can't do that.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.948
What about youth group?

01:11:11.981 --> 01:11:13.650
What about Blaise?

01:11:13.683 --> 01:11:16.251
You saw what happened when
we talked to his parents.

01:11:16.284 --> 01:11:18.253
And Mort, the insurance guy,

01:11:18.286 --> 01:11:19.455
he's making a
fortune by expanding

01:11:19.489 --> 01:11:21.491
the church's insurance policy,

01:11:21.524 --> 01:11:23.191
so that backfired.

01:11:23.225 --> 01:11:25.628
Tino was no help, no offense.

01:11:27.497 --> 01:11:30.500
But you can't just walk away.

01:11:30.533 --> 01:11:32.669
I'm tapped out, Carla.

01:11:32.702 --> 01:11:34.671
I don't wanna be here
when this ship sinks.

01:11:34.704 --> 01:11:36.439
There has to be
something that can be done

01:11:36.472 --> 01:11:37.607
to keep you here.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.777
I'm finally following
your dad's advice.

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:42.210
I'm taking a nap.

01:11:43.513 --> 01:11:45.615
Why can't you
be more like Tino?

01:11:45.648 --> 01:11:46.849
Tino?

01:11:46.883 --> 01:11:49.952
He keeps trying, even
when there's no hope.

01:11:49.986 --> 01:11:50.820
No hope!

01:12:05.735 --> 01:12:08.638
You can't
avoid her forever.

01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:10.873
Let's talk about you.

01:12:10.907 --> 01:12:12.875
What are you going to do?

01:12:12.909 --> 01:12:14.342
I have no idea,

01:12:15.343 --> 01:12:17.647
but I can't watch Blaise,

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.883
you know.

01:12:20.917 --> 01:12:23.519
- What's his deal?
- Blaise?

01:12:23.553 --> 01:12:24.454
He's a new Christian.

01:12:24.487 --> 01:12:25.488
He's got a lot of passion.

01:12:25.521 --> 01:12:28.024
Doesn't have a lot of knowledge.

01:12:28.057 --> 01:12:28.925
Wish he'd listen to you.

01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:32.662
I mean, you have
passion and knowledge.

01:12:32.695 --> 01:12:33.596
Think so?

01:12:35.398 --> 01:12:35.998
Thanks, Gretchen.

01:12:37.033 --> 01:12:38.801
I'm serious, Dad.

01:12:40.837 --> 01:12:43.305
You just call me dad?

01:12:43.338 --> 01:12:43.973
Yeah.

01:12:45.307 --> 01:12:45.942
Cool.

01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:50.947
Man, I wish there was
a way we could help him.

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.347
Well, I've talked to

01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:54.584
every rational person
who would listen.

01:12:54.617 --> 01:12:57.285
What did Blaise say
when you talked to him?

01:12:57.319 --> 01:12:59.354
I didn't talk to Blaise.

01:12:59.388 --> 01:13:04.393
Well, just say it to him
in a way that he'll hear you.

01:13:04.994 --> 01:13:06.294
That's it.

01:13:06.328 --> 01:13:07.730
I gotta go.

01:13:10.433 --> 01:13:12.334
I'm glad you're around.

01:13:12.367 --> 01:13:14.003

Hey, Mom.

Naturally, we'll spend the
rest of the morning in prayer

01:13:35.925 --> 01:13:38.394
in preparation for tonight's
Good Friday service,

01:13:38.427 --> 01:13:40.963
which surely, will be
an historical event.

01:13:40.997 --> 01:13:42.665
This is all new construction.

01:13:42.698 --> 01:13:44.033
Will Blaise fill pain?

01:13:44.066 --> 01:13:44.867
Sure.

01:13:44.901 --> 01:13:45.868
Excruciating.

01:13:45.902 --> 01:13:47.403
Will he be okay?

01:13:47.436 --> 01:13:48.571
We think he might.

01:13:50.106 --> 01:13:50.973
Come along.

01:13:51.007 --> 01:13:52.408

01:13:54.143 --> 01:13:55.845
And Blaise!

01:13:55.878 --> 01:13:56.913
What are you-

01:13:56.946 --> 01:13:58.346
- Come here.

01:13:58.381 --> 01:14:00.550
I wanna show you something.

01:14:13.963 --> 01:14:14.864
That's you.

01:14:18.067 --> 01:14:20.903
I'll never lust after
a mannequin again.

01:14:20.937 --> 01:14:22.772
Crucifixion is
no joke, Blaise.

01:14:22.805 --> 01:14:25.007
It's a slow, cruel death.

01:14:25.041 --> 01:14:27.877
God doesn't want you to
make a mockery of his Son.

01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:29.779
But Jesus died on the cross.

01:14:29.812 --> 01:14:31.447
In our place,

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.682

01:14:32.715 --> 01:14:34.150
That's the whole point.

His death, his burial,
his resurrection, period.

I'm not gonna let 'em

01:14:57.673 --> 01:14:59.475

01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:17.840
However, I must warn you,

01:18:17.873 --> 01:18:22.278
what you are about to
experience might be disturbing.

01:18:23.646 --> 01:18:26.215
If the sight of blood
makes you queasy,

01:18:26.248 --> 01:18:30.820
we ask that you move to the
fainting rooms in the back.

01:18:32.088 --> 01:18:35.591
What you are about
to see is not a play.

01:18:36.426 --> 01:18:39.095
This is real, people!

01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:43.199
Our goal is that one of our own

01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:46.902
feel what Christ felt that day.

01:18:48.405 --> 01:18:49.939
Blaise Cameron.

01:18:55.811 --> 01:18:58.114
And Guy Sides is here,
too, for some reason.

01:19:00.417 --> 01:19:02.751
Because you're not
gonna crucify Blaise.

01:19:05.221 --> 01:19:06.922
I am taking his place.

01:19:13.062 --> 01:19:14.697
Yeah, even better.

01:19:15.731 --> 01:19:18.000
Substitutionary atonement.

01:19:18.033 --> 01:19:22.071
He's taking his place,
just like our Savior.

01:19:22.104 --> 01:19:23.406
Blaise, what's happening?

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.907
I gotta go or I'll be late.

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.042
Late for what?

01:19:27.076 --> 01:19:28.445
It's gonna be okay.

01:19:28.478 --> 01:19:29.979
I think.

01:19:32.948 --> 01:19:34.283
What are you doing?

01:19:34.316 --> 01:19:36.819
I am
disinfecting your hand.

01:19:36.852 --> 01:19:40.055
So you can hammer a
rusty spike through it?

01:19:40.089 --> 01:19:42.758
- For the insurance policy.
- Oh.

01:19:46.195 --> 01:19:48.264
Mom?

01:19:48.297 --> 01:19:49.098
Hi.

01:19:49.131 --> 01:19:50.733
Mom, I'm Carla.

01:19:50.766 --> 01:19:51.468
Hi.

01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:53.470
Come on over here, Guy.

01:19:53.503 --> 01:19:55.337
Wow, he looks old.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:58.774
What's he doing?

01:19:58.807 --> 01:20:00.075
He's a pastor here.

01:20:00.109 --> 01:20:01.777
He's a pastor?

01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:03.413
What kind of church is this?

01:20:06.815 --> 01:20:09.218
I have to tell ya,

01:20:09.251 --> 01:20:10.920
I love this man.

01:20:10.953 --> 01:20:14.056
We have been together for years.

01:20:14.089 --> 01:20:16.825
We've had our ups
and downs, sure.

01:20:16.859 --> 01:20:20.996
But it is an honor having
you on our staff, right?

01:20:23.199 --> 01:20:24.266
Yeah.

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:25.768
And I move,

01:20:25.801 --> 01:20:27.102
that the board loves
having him on staff.

01:20:27.136 --> 01:20:28.804
Can I get a-

01:20:28.837 --> 01:20:30.339
- I
second the motion.

01:20:30.372 --> 01:20:31.140
All in favor?

01:20:31.173 --> 01:20:32.041
Aye.

01:20:32.074 --> 01:20:33.842
Opposed?

01:20:33.876 --> 01:20:34.843
Awesome!

01:20:34.877 --> 01:20:35.844
Let's crucify him!

01:20:43.953 --> 01:20:47.156
Does crucifixion means
something different here?

01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:48.190
I hope so.

01:20:50.192 --> 01:20:54.797
The last words Jesus
spoke on the cross were,

01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:56.232
"It is finished".

01:21:00.035 --> 01:21:02.371
And by "finished",
he meant done,

01:21:02.405 --> 01:21:04.907
over, accomplished, completed.

01:21:07.076 --> 01:21:11.880
And yet, we're still going
to have a crucifixion today.

01:21:12.815 --> 01:21:13.516
All right.

01:21:16.919 --> 01:21:20.289
You know, Skip, we
do go back a long way.

01:21:20.322 --> 01:21:22.825
When you started this,

01:21:22.858 --> 01:21:24.527
you were just looking
for creative ways

01:21:24.561 --> 01:21:27.564
to tell people about Jesus,

01:21:27.597 --> 01:21:29.865
and this thing blew up.

01:21:30.866 --> 01:21:33.202
And then our Youth
Program blew up,

01:21:33.235 --> 01:21:38.240
and people around the country
started asking me what I did.

01:21:39.108 --> 01:21:40.876
So I went around the country

01:21:42.512 --> 01:21:43.546
praying to this.

01:21:49.952 --> 01:21:53.055
But this wasn't enough
for some people.

01:21:53.088 --> 01:21:54.823
Couldn't be that simple.

01:21:54.857 --> 01:21:56.158
And I wanted to
hold their interest.

01:21:56.191 --> 01:21:58.961
I tried to hold their interest.

01:22:00.029 --> 01:22:04.099
And then one day, I woke
up the "Beach Ball Guy".

01:22:05.868 --> 01:22:09.539
You don't become the
"Beach Ball Guy" overnight.

01:22:09.572 --> 01:22:12.841
You become the "Beach
Ball Guy" slowly.

01:22:15.645 --> 01:22:19.081
I love those cheers
more than I realized.

01:22:20.349 --> 01:22:24.086
There's a lot of things
I could have stopped.

01:22:27.923 --> 01:22:30.225
You know, Skip, you were right.

01:22:30.259 --> 01:22:34.229
I've been part of everything
that's gone on here,

01:22:35.665 --> 01:22:37.966
but I blamed you alone,

01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:41.870
and for that, I'm sorry.

01:22:44.607 --> 01:22:47.544
Well, I promised
you a crucifixion.

01:22:49.978 --> 01:22:51.381
Thanks, I got it.

01:23:00.022 --> 01:23:02.157
Look at this moron.

01:23:02.191 --> 01:23:04.226
This guy is just way too busy

01:23:04.259 --> 01:23:07.630
to be stuck with a youth group.

01:23:09.098 --> 01:23:10.999
Not anymore.

01:23:39.061 --> 01:23:39.928
Carla?

01:23:48.471 --> 01:23:52.007
This was a gift from
my fiance, former fiance.

01:23:53.543 --> 01:23:54.977
It reminds me of Moldova,

01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:58.280
the beauty, the
heartbreak, the people.

01:24:01.116 --> 01:24:03.486
I grew up there, really.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.622
That's why I'm
planning on going back.

01:24:05.655 --> 01:24:08.056
I was planning on going back.

01:24:09.191 --> 01:24:11.661
It was my escape plan,

01:24:11.694 --> 01:24:14.062
but maybe it's time
to stop escaping.

01:24:34.183 --> 01:24:36.719
You should have told
me what you were up to.

01:24:59.642 --> 01:25:03.546
I've been angry at
a dad I never met,

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:05.548
and then I met him,

01:25:05.582 --> 01:25:08.317
and he's actually pretty cool.

01:25:11.153 --> 01:25:14.757
So I decided I should
be mad at my mom,

01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:16.426
but I know she loves me,

01:25:16.459 --> 01:25:20.730
and she did the best she
could in a tough situation.

01:25:23.098 --> 01:25:26.368
And honestly, I'm
tired of being angry.

01:25:29.171 --> 01:25:30.740
I want out of this
infinite loop.

01:25:50.693 --> 01:25:52.829
I've been watching the
Vikings during your sermons

01:25:52.862 --> 01:25:55.130
on this thing since 1992.

01:25:56.399 --> 01:25:58.200
Sorry, Pastor Skip.

I was jealous of Guy.

01:27:15.243 --> 01:27:16.144
I proposed to Carla,

01:27:16.178 --> 01:27:18.881
and she, well, turned me down,

01:27:18.915 --> 01:27:20.550
and I blamed him.

01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:26.623
This was the ring.

01:27:26.656 --> 01:27:28.323
The engagement ring.

01:27:44.974 --> 01:27:47.209
Can I get that back
after the service?

01:27:47.242 --> 01:27:49.244
Had it on layaway and I just-

01:27:49.277 --> 01:27:51.681
- Yes.

01:27:51.714 --> 01:27:52.548
Thanks.

01:28:42.432 --> 01:28:46.334
And I'm embarrassed to say
this, but it's a gimmick.

01:28:47.269 --> 01:28:50.807
I became obsessed with
finding novel ways

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:54.209
to draw people in
to hear about Jesus.

01:28:58.313 --> 01:29:00.550
I made the church the novelty

01:29:01.918 --> 01:29:04.854
when it should've
been about Jesus.

01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:10.660
I've asked God to forgive,

01:29:12.428 --> 01:29:14.296
and I'm asking you too,

01:29:15.865 --> 01:29:19.502

get back to the Gospel.

Guy.

01:30:28.104 --> 01:30:30.338
It was good seeing you.

01:30:30.372 --> 01:30:32.441
It was weird seeing you.

01:30:33.543 --> 01:30:35.411

- She's great.
- Yeah.

01:30:40.416 --> 01:30:42.118
Can't wait to see what your
church does for Christmas.

01:30:42.151 --> 01:30:43.386
Really.

01:30:43.419 --> 01:30:44.854
Bye, honey.

01:30:44.887 --> 01:30:47.423
Call me when you get home.

01:30:48.658 --> 01:30:49.759
Guy?

01:30:51.494 --> 01:30:52.395
Well, get a load of that.

01:30:52.428 --> 01:30:54.430
- Inspiring, though.
- Such an inspiring-

01:30:54.463 --> 01:30:55.631
- I don't think I've seen him

01:30:55.665 --> 01:30:58.134
do something like
that for years.

01:31:05.474 --> 01:31:06.475
Hey, Chad.

01:31:07.476 --> 01:31:09.745
Thank you so much for...

01:31:09.779 --> 01:31:12.615
I don't even know,
just being here.

01:31:12.648 --> 01:31:15.151
Well, it's my
privilege, Ms. Carla.

01:31:15.184 --> 01:31:16.452
It's what I do.

01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:22.391
He's a weird dude,

01:31:22.425 --> 01:31:23.526
but in a good way.

01:31:23.559 --> 01:31:25.528
What's his deal?

01:31:25.561 --> 01:31:26.495
I don't know.

01:31:26.529 --> 01:31:27.597
Let's ask him.

01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:29.498
Hey, Chad, what's your-

01:31:31.667 --> 01:31:32.735
- Chad?

01:31:36.472 --> 01:31:40.476
Silly smoke machine's
clogged again.

01:31:40.509 --> 01:31:42.511
Yeah, he's a weird dude.

01:31:42.545 --> 01:31:44.013
I'm hungry.

01:31:44.046 --> 01:31:45.514
Me too.

01:31:45.548 --> 01:31:47.450
- Let's grab a bite, huh?
- Let's eat!

01:31:51.087 --> 01:31:51.954
Hey, Tino!

01:31:51.988 --> 01:31:52.788

01:31:52.822 --> 01:31:53.723
What, what?

01:31:53.756 --> 01:31:54.457

01:31:58.094 --> 01:31:59.095
