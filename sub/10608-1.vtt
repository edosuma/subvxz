WEBVTT

00:22.000 --> 00:30.000
THE WAY OF THE GUN

00:58.265 --> 01:00.145
Hey.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.435
Hey-- Yeah, you. Get up.

01:03.940 --> 01:05.105
What are you, retarded?

01:05.275 --> 01:07.775
Get off the fucking car.

01:08.110 --> 01:11.945
Hey, dickless! Get off the fucking car!

01:12.615 --> 01:16.615
Hey, fuck-suck! Get your slippery
fucking ass off the car!

01:16.785 --> 01:20.165
Listen to me! Get off the fucking car
with your fucking ass!

01:20.330 --> 01:23.750
Shut that cunt's mouth, or I'll come
over there and fuck-start her head.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.920
Do something.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.465
Go.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.220
You're gonna wish you never
fucking got up this morning, asshole...

01:38.390 --> 01:40.475
...because my boyfriend's
gonna fuck you up.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.770
And then after that,
while he's fucking up...

01:42.935 --> 01:44.900
...your fucking gay uncle
over there...

01:45.065 --> 01:49.315
...I'm gonna fucking cut off your cock
and mail it to your mother, you faggot.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.360
Gaylord fucking bitch.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.571
How do you like that?
You like that a lot?

01:53.739 --> 01:56.616
You fucking faggot.
You like to ass-fuck?

01:56.784 --> 01:59.118
Fontanel fucking baby-head fuck?

01:59.286 --> 02:00.369
Go ahead.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.790
You like to fuck baby heads?
You like to fuck boys?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.083
He's gonna fuck you in the ass!
You like that?

02:06.251 --> 02:09.419
-He's not even gay, but he'll do it just--
-Honey, honey.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.839
She's got a big mouth,
but she's not kidding.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.926
I'm gonna whip you silly
and I'm gonna fuck you stupid.

02:15.427 --> 02:18.679
You wanna do the man dance?
First dance is yours.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.786
Hold on. Get real. Come on.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.996
Why would you pick a fight with them?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.374
-Look at my fucking face!
-You look beautiful.

02:46.542 --> 02:49.001
You look more beautiful than ever.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.934
For the record,
I'll call myself Mr. Parker.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.311
My associate will be Mr. Longbaugh.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.420
There is a natural order.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.964
The way things are meant to be.

04:17.132 --> 04:20.051
An order that says
that the good guys always win...

04:20.218 --> 04:23.638
...that you die when it's your time
or you have it coming...

04:23.805 --> 04:28.142
...that the ending is always happy,
if only for someone else.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.854
At some point, it became clear
that our path had been chosen...

04:32.022 --> 04:34.023
...and we had nothing to offer
the world...

04:34.191 --> 04:38.444
...our options narrowing down
to petty crime or minimum wage.

04:38.612 --> 04:42.198
So we stepped off the path...

04:42.532 --> 04:46.494
...and went looking for the fortune
that we knew was looking for us.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.039
Once off the path, you do
what you can to eat, to keep moving.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.500
You don't blow your chance
with nickel-and-dime.

04:52.668 --> 04:55.211
No possessions. No comforts.

04:55.379 --> 04:58.339
Need is the ultimate monkey.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.883
A pint of your blood
can fetch you 50 bucks.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.761
A shot of come, three grand.

05:03.929 --> 05:07.098
You keep your life simple,
and you can literally self-sustain.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.266
What would you say qualifies you
as a donor?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.602
I would say I am a fairly intelligent...

05:12.145 --> 05:16.315
...good-looking man,
physically fit, stable.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.359
Thank you, Mr. Hermann.

05:19.945 --> 05:20.987
Heterosexual?

05:24.741 --> 05:26.534
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.203
Are you a faggot?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.539
See, you asked me
if I was heterosexual.

05:31.707 --> 05:35.292
I asked you the same, only I was clear
about the answer I was looking for.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.338
-I just asked if you were heterosexual.
-Well, I've never killed a man.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.966
-Pardon?
-I've never killed a man.

05:42.134 --> 05:45.886
-I didn't ask if you had.
-I think of that as qualification.

05:46.722 --> 05:50.474
I'm just wondering why that strikes you
as a qualification for semen donation.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.978
I would say that's a fucking--
Excuse me, an important qualification.

05:54.146 --> 05:57.231
-No one's ever said that before.
-Have you ever asked?

05:57.941 --> 06:00.067
-No.
-You should.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.153
You take Los Angeles, okay?

06:02.320 --> 06:05.531
If I say that Los Angeles has become,
over the years...

06:05.699 --> 06:08.909
...a mecca for homosexual migration,
I am in the right.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.411
But look at what I am saying.

06:10.579 --> 06:14.206
I am making it sound like faggots are
nomadic, if not predatory, miscreants...

06:14.374 --> 06:16.417
...who have some implied need
to move around.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.712
I am also likening them to Muslims,
or Muslims to them.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.214
Saying L.A. is filled with faggots
is being honest.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.424
Is that a big deal?

06:23.592 --> 06:25.217
Nobody brings up sex
with dead people.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.886
-It's sick.
-You brought it up.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.763
-I never did it.
-I didn't ask that.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.389
You should.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.433
-Faggot. Just say it.
-Nope.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.601
-Say it.
-I'm not.

06:33.769 --> 06:37.605
Don't you think it's funny that if I grab
a woman's ass and she punches me...

06:37.773 --> 06:39.273
...she's fighting for her rights?

06:39.441 --> 06:42.401
But if a faggot grabs my ass
and I punch his lights out...

06:42.569 --> 06:44.445
-...I'm a homophobe.
-Let's just move on.

06:44.613 --> 06:50.201
-Are you a faggot?
-Any trace mental illness in the family?

06:50.368 --> 06:52.787
It's not what you say anymore, is it?

06:53.622 --> 06:55.623
It's all in how you say it.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.417
Yeah. Can you hold on just a sec?
All right.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.128
Where were we? Okay, listen.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.214
Pretend you don't smoke
two packs a day.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.966
Let's overlook
the jack-and-coke breakfasts.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.761
Imagine you get your life together,
get up before noon...

07:08.929 --> 07:12.139
...and somehow land the gig.
Steff? Please.

07:12.307 --> 07:15.267
You're still not cut out
to be a surrogate mother.

07:15.519 --> 07:18.479
Look, there's this one girl
who comes in here, due any day...

07:18.647 --> 07:20.523
...getting paid a million in cash.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.317
Sounds like a lot, right? Wrong.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.779
She comes in for treatments, like,
three times before the embryo takes.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.990
Turns out the couple
is perfectly healthy.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.244
Because the wife just couldn't be
bothered to carry her own child.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.704
They tell the girl what to eat,
when to go out...

07:35.872 --> 07:38.791
...bodyguards watching her
every minute she's out of the house.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.752
Of course it sounds fishy.
That's what I'm saying.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.089
She's gotta live with these people
for better part of a year.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.384
Poor girl's like a prisoner.
It's just not worth it.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.596
All right, look. If that's how you feel,
then go with God. I don't know.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.432
Why do you call and ask
if you're not gonna listen?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.352
Just call the doctor.
Maybe he can help you.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.189
No. He's in the book.
His name's Painter. Allen Painter.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.691
Yeah.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.030
And here was the thing.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.533
Some deep pockets,
a pregnant woman...

08:13.869 --> 08:16.495
...some bodyguards,
and a doctor's name.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.999
The longest distance between two
points is a kidnapper and his money.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.042
But we were through jerking off.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.461
You feel that, hon?

08:24.880 --> 08:27.047
-Fantastic.
-Yes.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.884
It's fabulous, Hale.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.602
She doesn't hate you, Robin.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.232
She most certainly does,
Mr. Chidduck.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.322
You're worried about the baby.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.032
No, I was--

08:53.200 --> 08:57.578
Come on. A woman needs security
like a man needs approval.

08:57.746 --> 09:03.250
She wants her past, present
and future to all be secured right now.

09:04.920 --> 09:09.757
And in a few days,
this baby will be a part of your past.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.678
And for you to leave
and not know it's secure....

09:15.972 --> 09:18.974
I would never ask you to trust me.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.810
It's the cry of a guilty soul.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.605
But trust life.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.775
Always trust life.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.237
If you're careful enough to listen...

09:32.113 --> 09:34.782
...life does take care.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.955
You're gonna be a good father,
Mr. Chidduck.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.666
And she's gonna be a good mother.
You'll see.

09:43.833 --> 09:48.796
As soon as she lays eyes on him,
nature will take over.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.881
I know it will.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.969
I hope to God you're right, Robin.

09:56.388 --> 09:59.431
Because if this baby doesn't change....

10:06.606 --> 10:08.148
"Him"?

10:13.321 --> 10:16.949
You didn't wanna know. I'm sorry. I....

10:23.164 --> 10:25.332
You did say "him."

10:25.500 --> 10:27.084
Him.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.843
I have to go to the appointment now
with Dr. Painter.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.594
I'm going to have a son.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.057
I'm going to have a son.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.196
So I didn't spoil it then?

10:56.364 --> 10:58.824
No, you didn't spoil it.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.212
-Right?
-Yup.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.756
Right.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.594
Come on.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.182
Every goddamn time.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.578
Four to One.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.663
Go ahead, One.

11:47.040 --> 11:51.251
Yeah. I'm sure it's nothing, but could
you drive by the front of the building?

12:02.680 --> 12:04.973
-How's your back feeling?
-It's better.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.934
-Yeah?
-Yes. It's better.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.644
Down here?

12:13.108 --> 12:15.901
Bet you can't wait for this little guy
to get out.

12:16.236 --> 12:20.280
Actually, I don't mind
if it stays in there forever.

12:29.207 --> 12:33.168
So unless there are any complications,
I shouldn't be seeing you until the 15th.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.629
Here's that video
I was telling you about.

12:35.797 --> 12:38.382
Some things you should know
about your delivery.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.008
Thanks.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.637
Yes, you can discuss that with....

13:49.037 --> 13:50.329
Hey.

13:52.540 --> 13:56.710
Okay, boys, we want this to go down
nice and quiet, so put the guns down.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.506
-Come on, we got you. It's over.
-Hey, hey, hey.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.799
-What?
-The people, man. The people.

14:05.637 --> 14:09.097
Can't you people see
there are guns here?

14:10.225 --> 14:13.393
Get the fuck out!

14:13.728 --> 14:15.562
Get out!

14:18.900 --> 14:21.401
All right, guys. Come on.
This is no good.

14:21.569 --> 14:25.072
You put the guns down. I'm gonna
count to three, and then I'm gonna--

14:25.823 --> 14:27.908
-Oh, fuck.
-What the fuck are you doing?

14:28.076 --> 14:29.952
You're supposed to be protecting her.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.579
-Oh, fuck. What'd I tell you?
-Shit.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.623
Walk away.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.292
Just walk away.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.836
They don't care about dying,
just losing.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.506
You're not gonna make it
out of here alive.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.882
Somebody called the cops.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.593
You know they're gonna come.
Just walk away.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.430
-Move.
-You sure?

14:50.598 --> 14:51.682
Move! Yes.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.602
Relax. Try to relax. Moving.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.778
-Got her.
-Okay.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.883
Moving.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.594
Move.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.809
-Moving?
-No.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.437
-Moving?
-Move.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.483
-Get her.
-Move.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.902
It's okay.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.032
Move.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.830
Four to One, they made a pass.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.666
They're coming out to you.
Do not, I repeat--

16:00.793 --> 16:02.336
Take the girl.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.260
Do not go to the doctor's office.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.180
Go upstairs to the top floor
and wait as long as it takes.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.640
Do you understand me?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.516
-Do you understand me?
-Yes.

16:16.684 --> 16:17.976
Go.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.146
Wait for me.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.909
Come this way!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.833
You care about this baby?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.917
Then you'll walk.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.672
Cover!

17:37.306 --> 17:39.099
Move!

18:13.634 --> 18:15.302
Are you okay?

18:15.470 --> 18:17.137
Miss?

18:17.305 --> 18:19.473
The baby's kicking.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.933
The guns and noise.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.227
The baby's kicking like crazy.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.772
Please.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.238
Relax!

18:40.411 --> 18:43.079
Could you be easy, please?

18:45.041 --> 18:49.169
-It's all right. You can open your eyes.
-I don't wanna look at your faces.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.962
It doesn't matter.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.109
All right.

19:13.778 --> 19:17.322
-Follow me downtown.
-All right, give him room.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.233
What's your name?

22:40.401 --> 22:41.651
Robin.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.737
And the father?

22:44.030 --> 22:47.240
You guys had it all figured out, huh?

22:48.743 --> 22:51.578
Listen, the sooner you tell us
who the money is, the sooner--

22:51.746 --> 22:53.663
And the sooner I end up dead.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.918
I know that as long
as I'm carrying this baby...

22:59.462 --> 23:03.256
...and you two don't have the money,
I'm alive.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.759
We're not talking about
how long you're gonna live.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.511
We're talking about
how slow you're gonna die.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.266
What do you call your baby?

23:15.853 --> 23:19.022
-It's not mine.
-Like that matters.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.774
You have to have a name.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.361
What do you think--?

23:26.697 --> 23:30.909
When you think about deaf people,
people who are born deaf...

23:31.077 --> 23:33.578
...who have never heard
a spoken word...

23:33.746 --> 23:37.373
...what do you think they call the sun
or their mother...

23:37.541 --> 23:40.043
...or their own reflection in the mirror?

23:43.631 --> 23:45.381
That's what I call it.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.218
There's no name.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.762
I'm not gonna name it.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.722
For what?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.001
Help.

25:03.544 --> 25:04.836
Shit.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.232
Hello?

25:26.400 --> 25:28.443
This is Colleen
at your message service.

25:28.611 --> 25:31.571
I have an emergency call
from Robin.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.574
It's hard for me to say that to you,
but I can't.

25:34.742 --> 25:37.243
You always said
you could tell me anything.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.537
I can't tell you this.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.166
It's not illegal, is it?

25:46.420 --> 25:47.587
No, Daddy.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.217
That was a stupid thing to ask.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.865
He's a doctor, man,
he'll do what we say.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.450
Really? I need help.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.661
You have too much faith in people.

27:01.829 --> 27:04.497
How can you kidnap somebody
with honor?

28:05.559 --> 28:07.143
Go straight.

28:12.066 --> 28:14.150
Now, would you get me Mr. Chidduck?

28:34.004 --> 28:35.713
Hi, Robin.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.883
Look at me. Talk to me.
How do you feel?

28:39.051 --> 28:40.176
I'm dizzy.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.427
I'm not gonna make it.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.012
Am I--?

28:43.180 --> 28:44.263
Am I gonna have it?

28:44.431 --> 28:46.265
How long has it been
since you had water?

28:46.433 --> 28:47.683
I don't know.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.730
No.

28:58.612 --> 29:00.905
You'll do what I say.
Do you understand me?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.615
You do what I say.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.301
If anything happens to me...

29:22.469 --> 29:27.306
-...if this all goes terribly wrong--
-It already has gone terribly wrong.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.184
I'm sorry.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.191
Just get me a fucking figure.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.777
You know--
What kind of a kidnapping is this?

29:39.945 --> 29:44.824
I mean, aren't we in
the demands phase at this point?

29:44.992 --> 29:46.659
You can't pay, Hale.

29:46.827 --> 29:47.952
Certainly, I can.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.664
It's not about the money you're losing,
the life of the girl, even the child.

29:51.832 --> 29:54.417
Listen. They get caught
crossing the border...

29:54.585 --> 29:58.254
...caught in another kidnapping,
running a fucking red light...

29:58.422 --> 30:00.756
...that money's coming
right back to you.

30:00.924 --> 30:04.051
That is money you're gonna have
to account for, explain.

30:04.219 --> 30:09.265
Understand what I'm saying here,
Hale? You cannot pay.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.019
Joe...

30:13.187 --> 30:16.439
...can't you just go over
and whatever?

30:16.607 --> 30:18.357
You know what.

30:18.775 --> 30:22.028
-Rub them out?
-No, no, no.

30:22.196 --> 30:24.864
If we call the police, surround them,
sweat them out...

30:25.032 --> 30:27.325
...the only thing they have
is their lives.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.203
We no longer have to negotiate.
They do.

30:30.370 --> 30:33.372
Robin is their bargaining chip.
They have to give her up to live.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.957
It's that simple.

30:35.125 --> 30:39.921
You keep your money, get the girl,
and nobody is looking at your books.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.219
I can't.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.602
No.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.229
No police.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.814
Just, you know....

30:59.191 --> 31:01.734
Hell, figure it out!

31:05.572 --> 31:07.698
She's dehydrated.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.369
In her condition,
her pain can feel very much like labor.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.829
But she won't lose the baby.

31:14.164 --> 31:17.250
No. But she should have it
no later than six days.

31:17.417 --> 31:18.751
Don't lie to me, doc.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.629
Look, now, I'm not gonna lie to you.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.507
I'm concerned
for the health of my patient.

31:25.384 --> 31:30.429
The baby is over eight pounds
and should come out by the 15th.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.350
Bushes, man.

31:36.478 --> 31:37.770
Can she have it sooner?

31:38.939 --> 31:40.022
You mean induce?

31:40.190 --> 31:41.607
Here?

31:42.025 --> 31:44.110
-Absolutely not.
-Don't hand me that, doc.

31:44.695 --> 31:46.946
-First baby was born in a cave.
-It had to be.

31:47.114 --> 31:48.614
But if you had to?

31:49.575 --> 31:50.616
Yeah.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.287
Now, as for the chances of the baby
and the mother surviving?

31:54.454 --> 31:56.872
All right, forget that.
Who are the parents?

31:59.501 --> 32:01.252
You guys don't--?

32:06.258 --> 32:08.134
Who are the parents?

32:08.302 --> 32:10.469
It's Francesca and Hale Chidduck.

32:11.263 --> 32:15.182
Oil-and-steel Chidducks?
Vegas union-buster Chidducks?

32:15.350 --> 32:17.643
-You guys have never--?
-Not our crowd.

32:17.811 --> 32:20.980
He's a front man for clean developers
that don't wanna get shot at...

32:21.148 --> 32:23.608
...for cutting in on rough territory.

32:24.151 --> 32:28.112
Sometimes for not-so-clean developers
laundering money out of Mexico.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.405
He's fucking crazy.

32:30.324 --> 32:32.825
He makes his living collecting
other people's enemies.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.328
Shoot-you kind of enemies.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.581
Their worst nightmare, and you
didn't know who you were grabbing?

32:38.749 --> 32:41.000
How much money does this guy have?

32:42.210 --> 32:43.252
I have no idea.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.503
Will he deal?

32:47.007 --> 32:49.050
Anything to keep it quiet.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.087
-Hello?
-Abner?

34:50.422 --> 34:51.589
Joe.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.799
Yeah. You busy?

34:54.967 --> 34:57.136
No, not at all.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.721
You drunk?

35:00.098 --> 35:01.807
A little. What can I do for you?

35:01.975 --> 35:04.143
There's somebody
I need you to stay with.

35:04.311 --> 35:07.646
Listen, man.
She needs medical supervision.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.274
She's not well. Let me stay with her.

35:10.442 --> 35:14.987
Don't get smart with me, doc.
Superman never gets the girl.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.782
-What's this?
-It's the ransom note.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.993
Just sit tight with this Chidduck guy
and we'll be in touch.

35:21.161 --> 35:22.995
-You're gonna be the bagman.
-What?

35:23.163 --> 35:25.998
You're gonna meet me
with the money.

35:26.249 --> 35:30.503
She'll be with my partner, and even I
won't know where until he calls.

35:30.962 --> 35:34.673
You'll come alone.
You'll come equipped to induce labor.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.176
If not, she dies.

35:37.511 --> 35:39.178
If you're followed, she dies.

35:39.346 --> 35:43.265
If I don't answer the phone
when my partner calls, she dies.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.059
It's on your head now, doc.

35:45.227 --> 35:49.188
The more careful you are with her life,
the less I have to worry, got me?

35:49.356 --> 35:51.065
That baby's coming out, understand?

35:51.233 --> 35:52.817
I understand.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.820
All right.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.907
You got a number for this thing?

36:01.201 --> 36:05.037
Don't say, "Who, me? He, she--"
You got a number?

36:15.298 --> 36:18.050
We'll call you when we're ready. Go.

36:39.781 --> 36:43.742
Are you gonna eat that other half
of your sandwich?

36:46.746 --> 36:49.123
I was gonna, but are you hungry?

36:49.291 --> 36:51.750
Yes, I'm pregnant.

37:11.605 --> 37:13.522
I like bacon.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.774
It's from a gas station.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.527
It's still good.

37:28.872 --> 37:30.539
Thanks.

37:37.005 --> 37:41.759
--management Director Singer is
accused for forcing minors to work....

37:43.136 --> 37:46.972
--deadline for ratification when the
contract expires at midnight tonight.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.974
The shooting began before 5:00...

37:49.142 --> 37:52.102
...after the suspects tried
to abduct an unidentified woman.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.480
The incident claimed
the lives of five people...

37:54.648 --> 37:57.232
...private security officers....

38:00.987 --> 38:03.572
Thursday night at Dive Bar.

38:19.172 --> 38:20.881
Thanks, Jack.

38:28.682 --> 38:31.183
-Which one of you is Jeffers?
-Who are you?

38:31.351 --> 38:33.602
Of course.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.355
I'm Joe Sarno. Mr. Chidduck sent me.

38:36.523 --> 38:39.358
-When can we--?
-I'm working on your release right now.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.819
Police are not ready
to charge you, but...

38:43.279 --> 38:46.365
...they are a bit upset that no one
will tell them what's going on.

38:46.533 --> 38:47.533
You a lawyer?

38:48.493 --> 38:50.035
Do I look like a fucking lawyer?

38:52.539 --> 38:55.290
I handle Mr. Chidduck's laundry.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.376
Things like you.

38:57.544 --> 39:02.297
I make unpleasant decisions for him,
which he can't and never will know.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.133
And he sleeps very well.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.884
You're a bagman.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.055
Let's just say...

39:10.223 --> 39:13.017
...I deal in the fine art of adjudication.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.644
Now, Obecks, is it?

39:16.229 --> 39:18.230
What did you tell the cops?

39:18.773 --> 39:22.443
Cop wanted to know why there was
two bodyguards and no body to guard.

39:22.610 --> 39:25.946
I told them who the client was
was confidential.

39:26.114 --> 39:29.241
He asked who took the client out.
I told him that was confidential.

39:29.409 --> 39:30.909
He said the client was a witness,
I said no.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.412
The client was removed
from the scene.

39:33.580 --> 39:36.707
He said I had all the answers.
I said yes, because it's the truth.

39:38.043 --> 39:42.755
Was there a time when one of
the deceased could've been in touch--

39:42.922 --> 39:45.966
-Wait, you don't think--?
-No, I don't think.

39:46.134 --> 39:50.137
Nor do I assume,
speculate or hypothesize.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.639
I merely observe.

39:53.308 --> 39:57.770
And what I observe
is one frantic fuckup...

39:57.937 --> 40:00.230
...on what should've been
a routine exec protect.

40:00.398 --> 40:04.234
The way I hear it, two fucking yahoos
wipe out half your staff...

40:04.402 --> 40:08.072
...coming out the front of
a fucking building in broad daylight...

40:08.239 --> 40:09.990
...empty-handed.

40:10.158 --> 40:13.368
Empty-handed.

40:14.204 --> 40:16.038
"How can this happen?"
I ask myself.

40:16.206 --> 40:17.831
-She was running.
-Unlikely.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.666
Making a play for herself.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.211
I had the girl in the box
headed back upstairs.

40:22.378 --> 40:24.129
You think a woman with a baby...

40:24.297 --> 40:27.174
...is gonna walk into a hail of pistol fire
for some fresh air?

40:27.342 --> 40:30.427
-She's been acting hinky.
-First time she's out of sight...

40:30.595 --> 40:33.263
...for a minute in nine months,
and she goes for the door.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.807
She was--

40:39.813 --> 40:41.688
You picked her to be the host,
didn't you?

40:41.856 --> 40:44.650
So, naturally,
this has to be our fault, right?

40:45.068 --> 40:46.276
Fuck me.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.320
Well...

40:48.822 --> 40:53.909
...I am, to say the least, perplexed,
as well as frustrated.

40:54.077 --> 40:59.248
It is Mr. Chidduck's wish that you
two idiots remain in his employ.

40:59.791 --> 41:03.335
He speaks very highly of you.

41:03.962 --> 41:07.506
He feels you'll be extremely motivated
in resolving this matter...

41:08.049 --> 41:09.842
...despite my urging him...

41:10.009 --> 41:13.178
...to fire your fucking ass
and have you fed to the fish.

41:14.013 --> 41:17.266
Beyond this,
the matter's been left to my discretion.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.768
The aforementioned
art of adjudication.

41:23.106 --> 41:25.440
Precisely, Mr. Jeffers.

41:26.234 --> 41:27.901
To wit...

41:28.278 --> 41:30.404
...should another macabre spectacle...

41:30.572 --> 41:34.032
...like the one that presented itself
this afternoon take place...

41:34.200 --> 41:36.618
...you will be cut loose.

41:36.786 --> 41:41.039
And then, Mr. Jeffers,
I will have my druthers.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.961
And I can promise you
a day of reckoning...

41:46.129 --> 41:49.381
...that you will not live long enough
to never forget.

41:56.306 --> 41:58.891
There's something you need to learn
about this business.

41:59.058 --> 42:01.894
-What's that?
-The only thing you can assume...

42:02.061 --> 42:05.480
...about a broken-down old man
is that he's a survivor.

42:09.402 --> 42:10.569
Jack.

42:18.244 --> 42:20.412
-You think she was running?
-It doesn't matter.

42:20.914 --> 42:24.499
The way I see it, she crossed over
when she got off the elevator.

42:24.667 --> 42:27.085
If Mr. Chidduck wants us
to resolve this, we will...

42:27.253 --> 42:30.923
...but from here on out,
our only concern is with the child.

42:31.090 --> 42:34.343
We have to consider the girl to be
as much of a threat as the two men.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.854
The subscriber you have called
is unavailable...

42:46.022 --> 42:48.607
...or has traveled
outside the coverage area.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.652
Shouldn't you be out there with him
or something?

42:51.819 --> 42:53.528
He's fine.

42:53.696 --> 42:56.448
What if something happens?
Aren't you guys a team?

42:56.616 --> 42:58.283
He'll be fine.

43:00.453 --> 43:02.955
Yeah?
What if he doesn't come back at all?

43:03.122 --> 43:05.249
He always comes back.

43:06.960 --> 43:09.836
The subscriber you have called
is unavailable or has tra--

43:10.004 --> 43:11.213
Fuck me.

43:11.381 --> 43:13.799
Are you sure she's all right?

43:13.967 --> 43:15.759
I think so.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.678
And the baby?

43:18.972 --> 43:21.807
As far as I can tell, it's fine.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.810
And they had no idea?

43:24.978 --> 43:26.353
None.

43:27.021 --> 43:29.064
Not until I told them.

43:29.524 --> 43:32.317
And I'm sure you didn't mention
your relationship.

43:32.485 --> 43:34.361
Hey, fuck you, Francesca.

43:34.529 --> 43:36.697
-What was I supposed to--
-Hey, easy.

43:37.490 --> 43:38.699
Easy.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.159
What good would that have done?

43:42.328 --> 43:44.037
You did the right thing.

43:44.205 --> 43:47.374
God knows he wouldn't wanna lose
his place at the table.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.880
Francesca.

43:54.048 --> 43:55.090
Allen.

43:56.175 --> 43:57.676
Allen.

43:59.262 --> 44:01.471
I didn't ask to come back here.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.473
You asked me.

44:03.891 --> 44:07.311
And I will not have her,
of all people, telling me what--

44:07.478 --> 44:11.356
For God's sake. For God's sake.
She's not herself.

44:11.524 --> 44:13.900
More today than most, I'd say.

44:14.360 --> 44:15.861
If Mom could see that cunt--

44:24.787 --> 44:26.330
Are you gonna pay?

44:32.712 --> 44:34.546
I'm going to the police.

44:39.218 --> 44:43.055
You're here out of a basic need.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.432
You needed money from me.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.893
I needed discretion from you...

44:48.061 --> 44:50.354
...loyalty, obedience.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.564
You are here, quite frankly...

44:52.732 --> 44:57.235
...because after what happened
in Baltimore, you were for sale.

44:57.403 --> 45:01.281
And you will do as you are told.

45:02.075 --> 45:04.576
-What about Robin?
-What about her?

45:15.254 --> 45:17.714
The girl needs to be reassessed.

45:17.882 --> 45:18.924
What does that mean?

45:19.092 --> 45:20.592
She ran, doc.

45:20.760 --> 45:21.843
She panicked.

45:22.011 --> 45:23.970
-What happened to your eye?
-Where's Sarno?

45:24.138 --> 45:26.556
Sarno came and went.
We thought he'd be with you.

45:29.685 --> 45:31.770
Just hold on there a minute.

45:32.772 --> 45:35.023
Sit. Sit down.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.251
Move your fucking hand.

46:02.969 --> 46:04.469
Hello?

46:04.887 --> 46:06.721
Are you the client?

46:07.223 --> 46:08.390
I am the client.

46:08.808 --> 46:11.143
Tell the doctor
to get on Highway 19 south.

46:11.310 --> 46:14.688
Across the border, he'll come
to a town named Salsipuedes.

46:14.856 --> 46:18.191
There, he'll find
the Nacio Madre motel.

46:18.359 --> 46:21.736
Across from it,
there is a payphone where he'll wait.

46:22.488 --> 46:26.408
He comes ready to induce labor,
and he'll leave with the baby.

46:26.576 --> 46:29.411
We let the girl go when we feel safe.

46:31.831 --> 46:33.707
He comes alone.

46:35.084 --> 46:36.626
He brings $15 million.

46:39.297 --> 46:41.965
$15 million?

46:44.343 --> 46:46.595
We're gonna need some time
to get that.

46:46.762 --> 46:49.014
Give me 24 hours.

46:51.392 --> 46:53.018
You got 12.

46:53.436 --> 46:55.020
Goddamn it!

46:55.688 --> 46:57.314
Twelve fucking hours?

46:57.482 --> 46:59.983
Jesus Christ!
How do you expect me to--?

47:01.277 --> 47:02.694
Okay.

47:03.196 --> 47:04.362
All right. Fine.

47:04.530 --> 47:06.490
Twelve hours. Jesus.

47:07.867 --> 47:08.867
Is that it?

47:26.677 --> 47:30.430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Small, unmarked bills.

47:30.598 --> 47:33.016
You know how much that weighs?

47:33.559 --> 47:36.561
Yeah, try a couple
of thousand pounds.

47:38.481 --> 47:40.649
All right. Fine. Hundreds.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.194
-That it?
-What do you think?

47:44.737 --> 47:47.989
-It has holes.
-Well, we're new at this.

47:49.158 --> 47:51.243
You're not gonna make it, kid.

47:59.377 --> 48:00.919
One's backfire.

48:01.087 --> 48:02.504
Three is gunplay.

48:04.757 --> 48:06.341
Step out.

48:18.187 --> 48:19.312
Put it down.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.648
A cop will come by,
blow your head off.

48:21.816 --> 48:23.775
Put your hands on your chest.

48:26.529 --> 48:28.196
Who are you?

48:28.656 --> 48:30.448
Well, son...

48:31.367 --> 48:33.618
...right now, I'm the button man.

48:34.495 --> 48:37.289
I'm the guy you wake up to one night...

48:38.124 --> 48:40.458
...maybe a year from now...

48:40.835 --> 48:42.627
...maybe two.

48:44.714 --> 48:48.550
And all you'll see is a pillow
over your face, and you'll hear a pop.

48:49.635 --> 48:51.970
Plenty more where I came from.

48:58.352 --> 48:59.769
Yeah, I used to be one.

49:01.647 --> 49:04.316
-What's happening?
-Looks like a bagman.

49:04.483 --> 49:08.069
He'll make an offer, something small.

49:08.237 --> 49:10.488
You should take it, maybe.

49:10.656 --> 49:13.575
No, you can't trust a bagman.
They'll always double-cross you.

49:15.036 --> 49:17.287
Tell you what I'm willing to do, kid.

49:17.663 --> 49:20.165
I'll take you to the man right now.

49:22.752 --> 49:25.170
He'll hand you a million in cash.

49:26.213 --> 49:29.174
You wait
while your partner sends the girl.

49:29.342 --> 49:30.967
If she gets there, we let you go.

49:31.636 --> 49:34.679
-Sounds shaky.
-Yeah.

49:35.848 --> 49:38.516
It's better than the alternative,
I can promise you that.

49:39.852 --> 49:41.519
You wanna wait here for 12 hours?

49:42.271 --> 49:45.523
I mean, look what happened
when you just stopped for some gas.

49:46.692 --> 49:49.569
We just wanna do this
clean and quiet.

49:49.737 --> 49:51.946
Get the girl, the baby back safe.

49:53.491 --> 49:55.533
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

50:28.109 --> 50:30.694
Can we have a couple cups
of coffee, please?

50:34.990 --> 50:36.408
So...

50:37.910 --> 50:40.412
...are you the brains of the outfit,
or is he?

50:40.579 --> 50:44.541
Tell you the truth, I don't think
this is a brains kind of operation.

50:46.794 --> 50:49.379
You think I agreed to help you
because of Baltimore?

50:49.547 --> 50:52.924
I know that before Baltimore,
you hadn't--

50:53.092 --> 50:57.011
I honestly hoped that if you
eased back into delivery, just--

50:57.179 --> 50:59.264
Don't be an idiot.

50:59.432 --> 51:02.809
No one incident makes anyone
what they are.

51:03.769 --> 51:05.854
Baltimore simply taught me
who I am.

51:06.313 --> 51:08.273
As for what I am...

51:09.275 --> 51:12.819
...I learned all about the value
of human life from you.

51:13.362 --> 51:17.115
That certainty
is more important than morality.

51:18.951 --> 51:22.495
-So abortion is more certain than--
-Exactly.

51:23.622 --> 51:25.623
I don't make mistakes anymore.

51:25.791 --> 51:27.500
I correct them.

51:28.794 --> 51:32.630
So I empathize with you, Dad.
I really do.

51:43.434 --> 51:45.143
Francesca.

51:46.353 --> 51:47.395
Hey.

51:49.774 --> 51:51.065
Fascinating, isn't it?

51:54.862 --> 51:56.946
I had no idea.

51:59.867 --> 52:01.826
It's really gotten me excited.

52:01.994 --> 52:04.329
Excited, huh?

52:04.497 --> 52:06.331
I missed you.

52:13.005 --> 52:14.881
They'll kill us.

52:15.299 --> 52:17.550
The people I'm in business with.

52:17.718 --> 52:20.386
The money I have leads back to them.

52:20.554 --> 52:23.431
We pay, they kill us.

52:24.725 --> 52:27.310
Any police, they kill us.

52:27.478 --> 52:30.313
That's your bed to lie in, not mine.

52:37.363 --> 52:39.239
You're my son.

52:40.407 --> 52:42.116
I love you.

52:44.370 --> 52:46.663
And it's your bed too.

52:47.873 --> 52:50.542
That's the sort of people they are.

52:58.717 --> 53:00.718
I'm sorry.

53:03.889 --> 53:08.059
I'm sorry I've gotten you involved
in this part of my life.

53:08.227 --> 53:11.437
I know it isn't your way of thinking,
and I'm grateful for that.

53:11.605 --> 53:13.857
I never wanted you to be that way.

53:14.024 --> 53:15.692
But don't be naive.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.819
She understood
who she was dealing with.

53:17.987 --> 53:19.737
She understood the situation.

53:19.905 --> 53:22.115
It's a simple fact of life...

53:22.283 --> 53:27.161
...that anyone who would do business
with a man like me can't be trusted.

53:27.329 --> 53:28.830
I'm a mother.

53:29.248 --> 53:33.167
As we speak, my child
is waiting to come into this world.

53:34.587 --> 53:38.381
And suddenly,
for the first time, I feel like I--

53:38.799 --> 53:41.259
-Well, that he deserves me.
-Francesca--

53:41.427 --> 53:43.219
I don't mean
I've earned him the way...

53:43.387 --> 53:45.430
...that a mother
who's carried a child has...

53:45.598 --> 53:49.100
...but I feel I've worked hard to become
the kind of woman who could...

53:49.268 --> 53:50.935
...have one...

53:51.103 --> 53:52.854
...naturally...

53:53.022 --> 53:54.606
...with you.

53:59.153 --> 54:00.945
You know where the baby is,
don't you?

54:01.113 --> 54:03.197
Of course I do.

54:03.991 --> 54:06.117
You know we have to go get her?

54:07.953 --> 54:10.038
I understand.

54:30.726 --> 54:32.852
If the girl should die....

54:33.520 --> 54:35.647
God forbid that anything
should happen...

54:35.814 --> 54:38.149
...but if there's any complications...

54:39.026 --> 54:40.652
...we'll take care of it.

54:40.819 --> 54:42.445
You understand?

54:42.780 --> 54:45.198
You just bring me back my baby.

54:47.576 --> 54:49.160
I've been watching them pile up.

54:49.745 --> 54:52.664
Nightstick, flashlight,
with a bulletproof vest.

54:52.831 --> 54:54.832
Fucking utility belts, right?

54:55.000 --> 54:58.378
Fucking sign on his head reading,
"Why bother?"

54:58.545 --> 55:01.339
And they love to say shit
like "ascertain."

55:01.507 --> 55:04.175
-"Surveillance."
-"Affirmative."

55:04.343 --> 55:05.843
"I need backup."

55:06.011 --> 55:07.804
"Adjudicate."

55:09.098 --> 55:11.808
-Adjudicate?
-Yeah.

55:12.851 --> 55:14.560
But, you know...

55:15.020 --> 55:16.771
...then you got the other side.

55:16.939 --> 55:19.440
You got these trigger-happy
cocksuckers...

55:19.608 --> 55:21.859
...all about the shooting
and the posturing.

55:22.027 --> 55:24.696
You-don't-know-who-I am thing.
"I've been to prison."

55:24.863 --> 55:27.115
-You got caught, you dumb fuck.
-These days...

55:27.282 --> 55:30.618
...they wanna be criminals more
than wanna commit crime.

55:31.078 --> 55:34.831
Well, that's not just crime.
That's the way of the world.

55:38.210 --> 55:39.544
What?

55:41.046 --> 55:43.047
I'm just talking here.

55:43.966 --> 55:47.593
But by their design, all we really need
to come back with is the baby.

55:47.761 --> 55:48.845
Think about it.

55:49.013 --> 55:51.973
No money, no perps, no nothing.

55:52.433 --> 55:54.350
We could kill these two,
keep the money...

55:54.518 --> 55:57.145
...bring Chidduck his baby,
and say it all went well.

55:58.355 --> 55:59.731
Well...

56:00.274 --> 56:01.983
...mostly well.

56:02.151 --> 56:03.901
-What? The girl?
-Yeah.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.737
No, see, when she doesn't show up...

56:05.904 --> 56:09.490
...it'll be assumed that she ate a bullet
and they made off to Bolivia.

56:10.284 --> 56:11.659
Damn it.

56:11.827 --> 56:13.578
It doesn't work.

56:14.038 --> 56:15.621
The doc.

56:18.167 --> 56:21.252
-The doctor gets shot in the fray.
-Right.

56:21.420 --> 56:22.962
We tried to help him...

56:23.130 --> 56:26.007
...but it was either him or the baby.

56:26.425 --> 56:28.259
He was alive when we took off.

56:28.427 --> 56:31.429
He must have died calling
for help in the desert.

56:32.598 --> 56:34.557
Creative articulation, my good man.

56:34.725 --> 56:37.518
-Just talking, of course.
-Sure.

56:38.353 --> 56:42.857
So all we need is a nice quiet place
to have a baby.

56:44.985 --> 56:47.070
As I said before...

56:47.237 --> 56:50.490
...my only concern is for the child.

57:02.127 --> 57:05.463
This is Jeffers.
I need to speak to the Question Mark.

57:05.631 --> 57:08.299
We might be needing a room
later on tonight.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.482
You know...

57:25.400 --> 57:27.568
...you seem like a good guy.

57:28.153 --> 57:29.987
You ought to get out of this business.

57:30.155 --> 57:31.864
What would I do then?

57:33.117 --> 57:36.369
You know, you get to be my age,
you start feeling a little different.

57:37.246 --> 57:38.996
You realize one day you're gonna zig.

57:39.164 --> 57:43.501
All that time you're thinking you're
gonna put something away tomorrow.

57:43.961 --> 57:46.838
Then, one day,
you're fresh out of lives.

57:49.675 --> 57:51.884
You got some money put away?

57:53.720 --> 57:54.804
I got a daughter.

57:54.972 --> 57:56.681
She's....

57:57.474 --> 58:01.394
She's putting something together,
says she'll take care of me, but....

58:02.771 --> 58:04.522
Not working out?

58:05.607 --> 58:09.152
Something like that, yeah.
Something like that.

58:17.327 --> 58:20.788
You sure you don't wanna take
a ride with me? Million in cash?

58:32.426 --> 58:34.093
Wish I could...

58:35.304 --> 58:37.555
-...but you're--
-Yeah.

58:37.973 --> 58:39.348
I'm a bagman.

58:39.516 --> 58:41.559
You are a bagman.

58:48.483 --> 58:50.693
Until that day, then, huh?

59:09.880 --> 59:11.714
What do you think?

59:12.549 --> 59:14.717
Oh, we can get her out of there
right now.

59:14.885 --> 59:16.093
Just the two, right?

59:16.261 --> 59:19.096
Please. I have to take a ride back.

59:19.264 --> 59:22.850
Don't do a thing without me,
no matter what.

59:23.185 --> 59:25.269
Jesus Christ, Joe, she's right--

59:25.437 --> 59:27.688
I'm counting on you
to remain pitiless here.

59:27.856 --> 59:29.065
Help me out.

59:29.233 --> 59:32.026
Just stay with her and let it play out.

59:32.194 --> 59:33.611
I'll be back.

59:36.823 --> 59:39.075
What? Wait a minute.
What's so funny?

59:39.243 --> 59:42.245
-Hold that card so I can whup your ass.
-You're cheating.

59:42.412 --> 59:46.082
No. I'm not cheating,
I'm winning, all right?

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:24.161
What?

01:00:58.405 --> 01:00:59.697
What are we playing?

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:01.782
Hearts.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.411
How do you play?

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:09.373
Well, the object of hearts
is to play the safest game possible...

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:11.667
...and finish
with the least amount of points.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:17.673
A heart is the only thing of value.
If you have one, get rid of it.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.051
Start with the two of clubs.

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.470
You'll need to throw down a club.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:25.473
If I don't have one,
then you can throw a heart.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:30.519
You can't lead with a heart
unless you have nothing else to throw.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:33.397
Or if someone breaks the suit.
You follow?

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:38.277
Couple of rounds, and she'll get it.

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:43.866
See, now, you had the high card,
so you take the trick.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:50.081
Now you lead.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:55.211
First trick always takes the odd card.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:59.423
Shit. You got the bitch.
She's 13 points.

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:02.051
Fuck the bitch.
Just get rid of your hearts.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.887
Or shoot the moon.
That's when you finish with everything.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:09.266
You get all the hearts and the queen
of spades. Everyone else loses.

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.018
Next to impossible.

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:13.354
If somebody figures out
what you're up to...

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:15.523
...they can sacrifice
and hold onto a heart.

01:02:16.525 --> 01:02:18.359
And then you lose.

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:23.781
Is that so?

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:27.743
Yep.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.474
I needed the money.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:03:01.152
It's a million dollars cash,
and I needed it for....

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:06.490
That's what it was about.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:08.325
I told myself that the Chidducks...

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:13.622
...they'd be good, you know, and that
the baby would have a good life.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:17.001
I thought it through a thousand times.
I thought I could do it.

01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:20.045
I was-- I was certain, and it was--

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:24.383
It was the-- What was best
for everyone involved.

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:27.344
For the baby, for the Chidducks...

01:03:27.512 --> 01:03:29.680
...for myself.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.185
The baby.

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:39.106
Then...

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:43.277
...I felt it move.

01:03:44.613 --> 01:03:46.322
And I saw his little hands.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:58.459
The baby's mine.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:04.673
Okay, I'm sorry, but by "yours,"
do you mean that--?

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:08.010
I mean that the Chidducks'
embryo didn't take...

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:12.556
...and this is my son
that I'm carrying.

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:24.318
So that means
that you and Mr. Chidduck....

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:25.736
No.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.656
Dr. Painter.

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:33.494
-That sneaky little quack.
-But it wasn't his idea. It was mine.

01:04:33.662 --> 01:04:37.581
I made it happen
because I needed the money.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.751
I made it happen.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:14.034
Listen, you don't want guys like him
or me touching your belly.

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:15.744
Please?

01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:21.959
That's creepy.

01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:28.549
Oh, no.
We'll meet just right past the border.

01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:32.136
Oh, listen, I appreciate it.
Okay, thanks a lot.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.058
You enjoy your coffee?

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:44.857
I deal in counteroffers
and adjudication.

01:05:45.317 --> 01:05:47.860
You do your job,
Mr. Bullet-Catcher, and I'll do mine.

01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:50.487
I'm curious as to why
they didn't kill you.

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:54.742
Maybe I didn't present
the real threat.

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:57.911
Not like you, shooting at guys
who agreed not to commit a crime.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.496
All right. All right. Come on.

01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:01.707
-The money coming?
-In a while.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:06.003
Then I suggest Dr. Painter
goes in now with 50 grand.

01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:10.674
Might help calm their nerves if they
feel the real money's getting close.

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.677
And when you go out, I'll go in.

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:15.095
And adjudicate?

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:18.265
If it comes to that, yes.

01:06:18.433 --> 01:06:20.351
You go in by yourself.

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:22.519
I think I can handle it.

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:24.730
And you, Cufflinks...

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.609
...stay here and watch Mr. Chidduck
in case there's a contingent.

01:06:28.777 --> 01:06:31.528
-In case there's a what?
-A third man. A button.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.823
Something, anything
that we haven't thought of.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.326
It's called CYA, you fucking moron.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.620
Cover your ass.

01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:43.666
Sir, as a collector
of prewar cop jargon...

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.210
...I find the old man refreshing.

01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:50.506
Nevertheless, he's one against two
who killed two of my four.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:53.676
I suggest you let him C your A.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:01.392
What seems to be the problem here?

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:03.143
The decision's already been made.

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:05.896
The doctor goes in
with the money alone.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:09.233
He follows the demands to the letter
and delivers the child.

01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:12.277
-We keep our distance.
-We move in if there's a complication.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.571
Our only concern
is for the lives at stake.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:17.574
-I hope you're not seriously--
-I'm in a tight corner, Joe.

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.993
It's pure geometry, Mr. Sarno.

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:22.830
We've been head-to-head
with these guys, remember.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:25.499
One old man all alone out there....

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:28.168
No one will come out alive.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.672
To be honest, Joe...

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.967
...that's not what this is about.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:36.927
You're conflicted here.

01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:41.932
Your job has been to protect me
and my associates and my money.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.393
But I no longer care about any of that.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.603
This is about my child.

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:51.984
And that, in itself, presents its own
special conflict, now, doesn't it?

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.820
Emotional detachment, Joe.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:56.447
For what it's worth...

01:07:57.073 --> 01:08:00.325
...I think these two
pretty much define it.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.788
Are you up to this?

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:09.960
I'll do whatever has to be done.

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:12.838
All right.
Jeffers and Obecks will follow you.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:15.758
See that you come out safely
with the baby.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.634
Sarno handles the money.

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.640
Sorry, gentlemen.
I'm not trusting any of you.

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:27.810
I'm afraid I want to eat my cake
and have it too.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.951
The subscriber you have called
is unavailable.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.578
Shit.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.582
-You were talking about killing her.
-No one said "kill."

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:52.336
He said "adjudicate,"
and that can mean a lot of things.

01:08:52.504 --> 01:08:56.673
There's more going on than you were
seeing. You don't have the eyes for it.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:03.013
What I heard was you ready
to put a woman's life at risk for money.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:06.850
Not money.

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:09.603
$15 million.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:13.774
Money is what you take
to the grocery store.

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:15.984
It's what you get out of an ATM.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.612
$15 million is not money.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:22.157
It's a motive
with a universal adapter on it.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:26.870
-You don't think that those--
-Never, never, never think.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:30.666
Thinking's how you lost your nerve
in the first place, Dr. Painter.

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:34.711
What, you think I don't know you?

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:39.466
You think your father and I
have secrets from each other?

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:43.886
I know about your residency,
your so-called hiatus.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:46.890
I know about that bad piece of luck
you had in Baltimore.

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:49.059
-I didn't lose my--
-I know...

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:51.478
...you weren't expected
to deliver this kid.

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.564
I know you can't.

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:56.525
I know your skull
is splitting down the middle...

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.111
...because you think
this thing's gonna play out...

01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:02.072
...and you're gonna have to deliver
this baby into the world.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.615
Well...

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:07.452
...what happened in Baltimore
will not happen here.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.538
You understand?

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.957
Because I won't let it.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:21.884
So....

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.303
So...

01:10:25.597 --> 01:10:28.599
...don't think, Dr. Painter. Just do.

01:10:29.601 --> 01:10:31.685
And whatever you do...

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:34.271
...don't tell them what I know.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:38.942
Keep your mouth shut,
and everything will be just fine.

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:41.612
Just fine.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:49.620
Dumping Sarno's gonna be tough
to explain.

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:53.123
Tougher still to do.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:56.627
I ain't buying his survival bullshit.

01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:01.548
He'll drop from a skull shot
like any other man.

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:05.594
We just take him out before he goes in,
bring the money in ourselves.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.972
And after that,
it's our word against the desert's.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.683
Creative articulation, baby.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.481
What is it?

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:21.360
Something in there between Sarno
and Chidduck.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:24.321
Ain't clear. It's chapping my ass.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.782
What was that shit he said
about conflict?

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:30.744
He said, "This is about my child.
This is a special conflict."

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:36.875
Why would saving
somebody else's child...

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:39.711
...be a conflict to anyone...

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:41.505
...unless....

01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:43.173
The girl.

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:45.968
Sarno.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:51.515
All set, doc?

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:35.809
I was up on this robbery bit...

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:38.895
...with a public defender.

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:42.232
I was looking at my first long stretch.

01:12:42.734 --> 01:12:46.236
Out of nowhere, this lawyer comes
to see me, says he can get me off.

01:12:47.155 --> 01:12:50.073
He says he'll do it for free.
I just gotta do a favor in return.

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:57.247
Then he tells me about this teacher
who's molesting his son.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.584
I went up alone.

01:13:00.752 --> 01:13:02.044
Didn't make a sound.

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:04.254
There was nice thick carpet
on the stairwell.

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:07.049
A light busted in the hall.

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:10.343
And the door was open, man.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.805
It was like it was meant to be.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:16.266
And I slipped in...

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:19.227
...and I found him
in the bedroom, naked...

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.271
...with all these pictures on the bed.

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:27.444
Man, that lawyer was right.

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:30.155
He was more than right.

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:35.285
And then he turned around,
and I didn't hit him.

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:37.537
I didn't hit him. I just said:

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:42.042
"Lay on the bed, face down."

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.002
And he did it.

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:49.674
I was savoring it.

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:53.970
I mean, really, really enjoying it.

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:58.433
Thinking about how I was gonna take
a Polaroid and send it to that lawyer...

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:01.353
...so maybe he could sleep better
at night...

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:04.022
...and maybe take one for myself,
so I could--

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:11.363
And then I heard him praying:

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:15.951
"Now I lay me down to sleep.

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:18.328
I pray the Lord my soul to keep."

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:21.873
And you know something?
It stayed with me.

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:23.917
It bothered me.

01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:27.045
Of all the people I'd done it to,
that had to be the one I felt.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:29.005
And to this day...

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:32.259
...I can't go to sleep
unless I say that prayer.

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:38.348
You wanna get out now?
You wanna quit?

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:41.184
This is never gonna
come your way again.

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:44.271
What if the day comes
and you're face down, waiting?

01:14:44.438 --> 01:14:48.775
And what, if in that final fleeting second
of life, you start to believe in God?

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.528
What are you gonna
have to give him?

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.823
What will you say in your defense?

01:14:56.450 --> 01:15:00.162
What does it matter
we take a child away from his mother?

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:05.125
After all the people we've robbed
and maimed and murdered...

01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:07.335
...you think it matters?

01:15:08.588 --> 01:15:10.380
It matters.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:13.967
Believe me, it matters.

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:33.486
Wanna leave her a note?

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:46.166
No. You know,
I think it's better if we just leave.

01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:49.920
-You can't leave her alone.
-She's not alone.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:53.423
There's some guy behind the diner.
He'll get her as soon as we're gone.

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:54.925
All right.

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:03.600
I left my jacket in there.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:09.481
I'll get it.

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:39.302
You know what I wanna tell God
when I see him?

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:43.014
I'm gonna tell him I was framed.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:46.268
I'm at the Nacio Madre Hotel.
There's been a shooting.

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:01.533
-A woman in your condition--
-The police are on their way.

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:05.078
You can come in shooting.
At least I'll be taking one of you with us.

01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:08.790
Just get in your fucking car
and move on!

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.835
I got all night long. I'm not moving.

01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:14.045
Test me.

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:16.840
Peekaboo.

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:26.433
Is that baby hungry yet, Robin?

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:29.060
Whose money is it?

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:31.271
The worst.

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:34.691
Do you believe in karma, Joe?

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:36.484
Karma?

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:42.198
Karma's only justice
without the satisfaction.

01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:44.993
I don't believe in justice.

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:50.081
Well, tonight,
I certainly hope you're right.

01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:15.750
Fucking useless.

01:20:55.226 --> 01:20:56.809
It's okay.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:02.148
-Robin, get in the car.
-It's okay.

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:08.404
Robin. Robin, let's get in the car.

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:10.949
Who are you?

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:14.911
-Robin. Robin.
-Robin.

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:16.329
Get in the car.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.915
-Don't do it.
-Who the fuck are you?

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.708
-Who the fuck are you?
-Robin.

01:21:22.086 --> 01:21:26.172
Mind your business. Robin,
come with me and get in the car.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.591
Come on, it's over now.
Robin, get in the car.

01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.428
Tranquilo, okay?

01:21:37.268 --> 01:21:38.268
What are we doing?

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:40.478
He wants us to put
our hands on the car.

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:06.296
He wants us to get on the ground.

01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:21.603
Get up. Get up.

01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:39.203
She's going for the car, man.

01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:44.834
Robin, come get in the car.

01:22:55.763 --> 01:22:57.847
-Careful.
-If I wanna hit her, I hit her.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:59.223
If I wanna miss, I miss.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:02.185
Robin, come get in the car right now!

01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:06.356
To the right. To the right! To the right!

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:25.458
Come on.

01:24:11.422 --> 01:24:13.548
Why are they headed south?

01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:43.369
Where are we going?

01:24:44.037 --> 01:24:45.997
-Fuck.
-We have her. Just take us back.

01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:48.040
Those shots were from
north of the motel.

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.251
I'm not going through more of that.

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:54.422
-What about Sarno? Shouldn't we call?
-Yeah, I'm gonna call Sarno, all right.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:57.508
I have a place we can go
until it's safe.

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:00.845
Trust me.

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:10.521
It's okay. The worst of it is behind us.

01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:17.028
Promise me something.

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:19.530
You promise me I'll see my baby...

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:22.366
...before he takes him back
to the Chidducks.

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:28.831
I promise.

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:35.254
Yeah, it's me again. We're coming.

01:25:35.422 --> 01:25:37.256
Tell him to be ready.

01:25:54.691 --> 01:25:56.859
-Yeah?
-It's me.

01:25:57.027 --> 01:25:59.946
-Where the hell you been?
-I've been trying to get a signal.

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:01.614
A couple of guys showed up.

01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:07.119
It got pretty choppy.
One of them made off with her.

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:09.789
-They're headed south.
-Is Robin all right?

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:11.791
Yeah. Yeah, she seems okay.

01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:16.045
You just keep heading south.
I'll talk you in as best I can.

01:26:16.213 --> 01:26:17.880
Look, Abner. Listen--

01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:20.758
I'm sorry I couldn't put my hand to her.

01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:23.886
-I gotta go.
-Hey, Abner--

01:26:27.391 --> 01:26:31.310
No!

01:26:34.398 --> 01:26:36.524
I'm gonna pull out
some of your fingernails...

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:38.901
...and I'm gonna leave you
to think about it.

01:26:39.069 --> 01:26:41.529
Then later, I'll come back
and slash your eyeballs.

01:26:42.948 --> 01:26:44.866
Whatever else I do to
you after that...

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.660
...I'll pour gasoline into your eyes
from time to time...

01:26:47.828 --> 01:26:49.537
...to keep you from passing out.

01:26:50.998 --> 01:26:53.416
Bottom line, guy,
I'm gonna ask you one more time...

01:26:53.584 --> 01:26:55.960
...and I'm never gonna ask you again.

01:26:56.879 --> 01:26:59.088
Where did they take the girl?

01:27:01.091 --> 01:27:03.634
I don't know.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.848
No!

01:27:09.016 --> 01:27:12.351
No!

01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:23.946
Oh, God!

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.805
Oh, God!

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:57.939
Please help me.

01:27:58.941 --> 01:28:00.733
Please.

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:05.655
I need to get to a hospital!

01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:36.936
Bitch.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:12.555
What is this? What is this?

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:16.726
I got a business to run,
for chrissakes.

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:19.020
I left her with the doctor.

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:25.359
-Where were you?
-I had to go to the-- What happened?

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:26.736
Please.

01:29:26.903 --> 01:29:29.530
Who took your IV out?
Let's get it back in.

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:33.784
I can't have pregnant women
walking around bleeding...

01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:35.369
...and upsetting my customers.

01:29:35.537 --> 01:29:39.248
You are getting paid a lot of money,
sir, and I cannot do this by myself.

01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:41.125
Don't let her leave your sight again.

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:45.254
If I don't put the IV back in, contractions
are gonna slow and labor's gonna stop.

01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:46.756
No!

01:29:46.965 --> 01:29:50.760
-What's the matter?
-It's killing me. Something's wrong.

01:29:50.927 --> 01:29:53.095
I don't see any money.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:58.225
This is 50. I will make a call, you will
have double that in under an hour.

01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:00.436
So make the phone call.

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:04.482
I need the fucking baby first.
Will you please help me tie her down?

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:06.192
It won't come out.

01:30:06.443 --> 01:30:08.444
It's killing me.

01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:10.946
Oh, my God.

01:30:16.203 --> 01:30:18.120
Is she supposed to be bleeding
like that?

01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:19.455
She's had an abruption.

01:30:19.956 --> 01:30:24.168
The placenta has separated from her
uterus, and she's bleeding internally.

01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:27.713
It's gonna be okay.

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:30.591
It's gonna be okay.

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:32.885
Make it stop.

01:30:33.053 --> 01:30:34.261
Is the baby going to die?

01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:39.308
What? What is it?

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:42.686
-I have to give her a C-section.
-Do it.

01:30:43.146 --> 01:30:44.522
A delivery is one thing.

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:48.025
You're talking about major surgery.
I could kill her.

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:50.027
I have to get her to a hospital.

01:30:50.195 --> 01:30:54.281
My only concern right now is for
the child, Dr. Painter. No one else.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.202
Now do it.

01:31:01.331 --> 01:31:03.499
It's our baby!

01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:06.544
It's our baby. Tell him it's our baby
and he'll let us go!

01:31:06.753 --> 01:31:08.337
It's not the Chidducks'.

01:31:08.505 --> 01:31:10.506
They could have another baby!
Just tell him!

01:31:10.674 --> 01:31:13.092
Tell him it's our baby!

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.552
Is this true?

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:20.683
Tell him!

01:31:30.277 --> 01:31:32.444
He'll let us go. Tell him.

01:31:36.032 --> 01:31:38.284
Are you comfortable, Robin?

01:31:38.952 --> 01:31:40.703
We're gonna take out your baby now.

01:31:42.122 --> 01:31:44.540
No!

01:32:44.684 --> 01:32:48.229
-What is that?
-It's a spinal.

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:53.400
Don't knock me out.
I have to see my baby, Allen.

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:55.194
I just wanna see my baby.

01:32:55.362 --> 01:32:57.947
It'll only numb you
from the waist down.

01:32:58.448 --> 01:33:01.242
-Now stay still.
-Okay.

01:33:06.957 --> 01:33:09.333
I'm gonna get a smoke.

01:33:49.082 --> 01:33:50.708
She's--

01:33:53.503 --> 01:33:57.256
She's up there with...

01:33:58.174 --> 01:34:00.342
...the doctor and...

01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:03.137
...the colored fella.

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:05.681
Oh, Jesus.

01:34:08.351 --> 01:34:10.853
I'm sorry, Joe.

01:34:11.855 --> 01:34:13.605
There's no...

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:16.442
...need to be sorry, Abner.

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:21.030
I'm dying.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.575
We'll get somebody right away.

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:32.583
It's not like I'm scared or anything.

01:34:33.418 --> 01:34:36.754
-Listen, Abner.
-I'm dying, Joe.

01:34:54.397 --> 01:34:57.024
Remember that time...

01:34:58.276 --> 01:35:00.152
...the time...

01:35:01.237 --> 01:35:03.113
...that we...?

01:35:07.243 --> 01:35:08.243
Jeez.

01:35:08.411 --> 01:35:11.580
-What--?
-Oh, I'm dying, Joe.

01:35:14.501 --> 01:35:15.876
I know.

01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:20.547
I'm sorry, Abner.

01:35:24.594 --> 01:35:26.095
Joe?

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.766
Yeah, Abner. I'm right here.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.482
If it's not too much trouble...

01:35:42.612 --> 01:35:45.489
...I'd kind of like to be alone.

01:35:57.168 --> 01:35:59.211
Till that day, pal.

01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:35.539
For chrissake, will you--?

01:36:37.167 --> 01:36:39.626
I think there are some men here
to see you.

01:37:17.874 --> 01:37:19.791
Can I get some help in here?

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:38.745
-Can you walk?
-I wanna get this cocksucker.

01:39:10.403 --> 01:39:11.778
Oh, no.

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:13.739
What is it, man?

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.827
Bagmen.

01:39:21.706 --> 01:39:22.748
Let's get the girl.

01:39:22.915 --> 01:39:24.958
-I wanna see...
-You got it, doc?

01:39:25.126 --> 01:39:26.793
-Almost.
-...my baby.

01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:47.689
No!

01:39:48.524 --> 01:39:50.609
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:54.237
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:17.552
Is my baby okay?

01:40:27.397 --> 01:40:28.772
I wanna....

01:40:44.288 --> 01:40:46.081
My baby.

01:41:04.767 --> 01:41:06.768
How's the baby, doc?

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:13.442
What's going on with the baby, doc?

01:41:13.609 --> 01:41:14.693
Doc?

01:41:17.363 --> 01:41:19.698
How's the baby?

01:41:31.502 --> 01:41:34.713
-Get back in there, doc.
-Sorry.

01:42:15.505 --> 01:42:16.713
They're coming, man.

01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:25.388
Come on.

01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:33.522
I wanna....

01:42:40.571 --> 01:42:42.239
I want...

01:42:42.532 --> 01:42:44.449
...my baby.

01:42:44.784 --> 01:42:48.161
Come on, brother. Let's do this.

01:43:09.058 --> 01:43:10.350
She's had enough, pal.

01:43:53.519 --> 01:43:54.978
Move.

01:44:20.504 --> 01:44:22.422
Just relax now.

01:44:26.552 --> 01:44:28.345
Almost there.

01:44:47.865 --> 01:44:49.783
It's under control.

01:44:53.162 --> 01:44:55.455
There's nothing you can do here.

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:02.379
Get out.

01:45:42.336 --> 01:45:45.547
There's always free cheese
in a mousetrap.

01:46:13.743 --> 01:46:14.826
What do you think?

01:46:15.536 --> 01:46:18.830
I think a plan is just a list of things
that don't happen.

01:46:19.248 --> 01:46:21.499
If we die...

01:46:23.502 --> 01:46:25.545
...we die alone.

01:47:50.673 --> 01:47:52.549
Are you all right?

01:47:54.051 --> 01:47:56.344
Yeah, I'm still here.

01:47:57.596 --> 01:47:59.097
Are you still with me?

01:47:59.265 --> 01:48:01.057
I'm still here.

01:48:04.603 --> 01:48:06.312
Yeah.

01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:12.683
Come on up.

01:53:25.757 --> 01:53:28.676
So are you gonna let her
keep the baby?

01:53:28.844 --> 01:53:30.720
It's her baby.

01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:33.222
Her and the doctor.

01:53:35.185 --> 01:53:37.060
Is that true?

01:53:39.565 --> 01:53:40.815
What do you think?

01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:50.155
Come on.

01:53:50.325 --> 01:53:53.365
You can tell somebody is family
just by looking at them.

01:54:46.255 --> 01:54:48.130
Until that day, then.

01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:51.175
Until that day.

01:55:05.105 --> 01:55:07.650
What are you gonna tell God now?

01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:20.705
We don't want your forgiveness.

01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:22.875
We won't make excuses.

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:26.460
We're not gonna blame you
even if you are an accessory.

01:55:26.630 --> 01:55:29.465
But we will not accept
your natural order.

01:55:29.630 --> 01:55:31.175
We didn't come for absolution.

01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:33.885
We didn't ask to be redeemed.

01:55:34.050 --> 01:55:36.470
But isn't that the way it is...

01:55:36.805 --> 01:55:39.140
...every goddamn time?

01:55:39.475 --> 01:55:41.310
Your prayers are always answered...

01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:44.685
...in the order they're received.

01:55:49.985 --> 01:55:51.275
I'm pregnant.
