00:03.703 --> 00:06.014
<i>You are being watched.</i>

00:06.173 --> 00:08.346
<i>The government
has a secret system,</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:08.509 --> 00:12.753
<i>a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.</i>

00:12.913 --> 00:15.086
<i>I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,</i>

00:15.249 --> 00:16.819
<i>but it sees everything.</i>

00:16.984 --> 00:20.158
<i>Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.</i>

00:20.320 --> 00:22.926
<i>The government considers
these people irrelevant.</i>

00:23.090 --> 00:24.728
<i>We don't.</i>

00:25.559 --> 00:29.837
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

00:29.997 --> 00:31.772
<i>You will never find us.</i>

00:31.932 --> 00:33.934
<i>But victim or perpetrator,</i>

00:34.101 --> 00:37.275
<i>if your number's up,
we'll find you.</i>

00:43.277 --> 00:45.780
<i>We know about Quinn
and what he did to Cal.</i>

00:45.946 --> 00:48.290
<i>Then you know why
he can't get away with it.</i>

00:48.448 --> 00:49.688
<i>Where are we taking him?</i>

00:49.850 --> 00:51.050
<i>Fed building downtown.</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:53.588
<i>The FBI may be the only ones
we can trust.</i>

01:01.028 --> 01:03.201
The judge has been asking
to see you.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.039
Do we have a problem,
Your Honor?

01:10.203 --> 01:13.082
Do you consider a felony
murder charge a problem?

01:13.240 --> 01:15.584
Because if that bitch cop
and her gun-wielding cohort

01:15.742 --> 01:18.814
get Alonzo Quinn into federal custody,
that's what we'll all be facing.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.889
No one is going to be charged.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.090
We have checkpoints
on all the roads.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.663
They'll never make it downtown.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.925
Carter said she had evidence
on HR,

01:29.089 --> 01:30.261
pictures, recordings.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.165
She has me on tape
working with you people.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.169
We have a team
tossing her place.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.241
No one is going to kill her
until we get that evidence.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.839
We need to come up with a story.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.178
Do you have a firearm
in the house?

01:47.341 --> 01:49.014
In that far drawer.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.824
Fine, what's the story?

01:56.984 --> 02:00.295
Robbers broke into your home,
they looted the place...

02:01.288 --> 02:02.699
...and shot you.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.698
Old man would have talked.

02:10.864 --> 02:14.368
He's got states evidence
written all over him. Get rid of this.

02:14.534 --> 02:18.380
Bring me Officer Carter
and Alonzo Quinn alive.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.314
And if Quinn gets
so much as a hangnail,

02:21.475 --> 02:24.547
I will come after you.
Do you understand?

02:26.213 --> 02:27.954
What about our pal in the suit?

02:30.183 --> 02:32.891
I should have ended him
a long time ago.

02:34.855 --> 02:38.359
Tell our friends, shoot to kill.

You know what happens
if you try anything?

03:16.596 --> 03:18.701
I believe
I can fill in the blanks.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.772
We're not stopping until we get you
to the fed building downtown.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.781
So don't die on us, you hear?

03:26.940 --> 03:29.614
You keep forgetting,
this is my city.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.278
There's just two of you.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.427
We won't be outmatched for long.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.053
Finch is sending the cavalry.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.926
Wouldn't kill you to clean up
once in a while.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.399
Why?
I got you as a maid.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.939
Oh, yeah?
Well, the maid's got to go to work.

03:48.095 --> 03:51.099
Mrs. Olson is going to drop in
and make sure you're okay.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.076
Nice necklace, Dad.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.641
It's a key, smart guy.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.376
Friend of mine's
got some information

04:01.541 --> 04:04.579
on some very bad guys,
and I'm keeping it safe.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.882
Sure that's a good idea,
trusting you with it?

04:08.648 --> 04:10.559
Turns out your old man's
a pretty tough guy.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.993
The bad guys,
they don't want no part of this.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.828
So you mind your own business
and get some shut-eye?

04:16.890 --> 04:18.665
Good night, buddy.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.772
What kind of cop doesn't use
a vertical dead bolt?

04:31.938 --> 04:33.440
What the hell?
Where'd you come from?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.779
It doesn't matter.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.683
It's where we're going
that's important.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.184
Grab your gun, Lionel.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.188
Let me guess,
Mr. Congeniality's in trouble.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.587
You could say that.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.455
Reese and Carter
nabbed the head of HR.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.028
They need a little help

04:45.185 --> 04:47.187
escorting him into FBI custody.

04:47.354 --> 04:48.662
You ready?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.942
I don't care who you are,
you break in my house again,

04:50.957 --> 04:52.937
- you're going to be sorry.
- I'm already sorry.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.653
I'm gonna have to listen to your whiny ass
all the way to Queens.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.867
Me? You know the dog's the only
one that likes you, right?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.651
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

05:06.675 --> 05:09.212
<i>Please report
any bags left unattended.</i>

05:09.376 --> 05:11.151
I'm sorry I got you into this.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.383
You get us into Manhattan, I'll take
Quinn to the fed building alone.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.296
What is it about you, Joss,

05:18.685 --> 05:21.029
makes you want to do everything
on your own?

05:21.188 --> 05:22.531
What is it about you, John,

05:22.689 --> 05:25.363
that makes you want to save
everybody else's life but your own?

05:25.525 --> 05:27.527
<i>- Mr. Reese?</i>
- Excuse me.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.372
<i>I have some very bad news.</i>

05:31.531 --> 05:33.306
I'm guessing this is
about a number.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.209
Several, actually.

05:35.368 --> 05:39.407
It took me a while to realize
that they were all prior aliases

05:39.573 --> 05:41.746
for one person.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.689
You, Mr. Reese.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.083
Something wrong?

05:51.084 --> 05:52.585
No more than usual.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.019
<i>Check your phone.</i>

05:54.855 --> 05:56.493
<i>HR has put a bounty
on your head,</i>

05:56.523 --> 05:58.332
<i>and they're distributing
this picture.</i>

05:58.358 --> 06:00.235
My old chess partner
called to inform me

06:00.260 --> 06:02.262
his men will sit this one out.

06:02.429 --> 06:03.601
That's nice of Elias.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.175
<i>Yes, but unfortunately,
they're the only ones.</i>

06:06.333 --> 06:10.713
<i>It appears that every criminal
in New York is trying to kill you.</i>

06:12.772 --> 06:15.082
Don't suppose they're
just trying to be friendly?

06:18.378 --> 06:21.518
That's a nice suit.
Maybe we'll bury you in it.

06:21.681 --> 06:24.685
Too bad.
I just had it cleaned.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.863
'Unh!
"Ugh!

06:38.732 --> 06:39.870
Ugh!

06:41.968 --> 06:43.709
Something funny?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.244
Subway, thugs.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.476
Kind of reminds me
of the first time we met.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.784
Got to transfer to the R train.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.980
It'll drop us a couple blocks
from Federal Plaza.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.065
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

06:54.147 --> 06:56.821
<i>Due to an incident at
the Lexington Avenue station,</i>

06:56.983 --> 06:59.759
<i>all train service has been
suspended to Manhattan.</i>

06:59.920 --> 07:01.490
Guessing that's not
just bad luck.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.657
Our friends in blue
aren't making it easy for us.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.235
- Keep moving.
- Or what?

07:06.393 --> 07:07.394
You'll shoot me?

07:07.560 --> 07:09.597
That's exactly what I'll do.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.243
I'm giving you a warning.
That's more than you gave Cal.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.504
Finch, I need an exit strategy.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.773
- Finch, you there?
- Looking for this?

07:21.508 --> 07:23.784
You two still believe
you're the heroes of this story?

07:23.944 --> 07:27.858
My men will have every subway, train,
and road from Queens blocked.

07:28.014 --> 07:31.621
This ends one way, and it's not
with you riding into the sunset.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.129
Let's go. Your men are
looking for three people.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.766
We just need better camouflage.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.862
Mr. Reese?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.107
Can you hear me?

07:45.598 --> 07:47.998
<i>Ms. Shaw, I'm afraid
I've lost contact with Mr. Reese.</i>

07:48.001 --> 07:51.676
Well, at the risk
of stating the obvious, Finch,

07:51.838 --> 07:54.842
you could just ask The Machine
for his location.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.214
I don't speak to The Machine,

07:56.376 --> 07:58.176
and The Machine
doesn't speak to me, Ms. Shaw.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.959
Well, it speaks to her.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.992
I might not know
where our friends are,

08:10.156 --> 08:11.897
but I certainly know
where they're headed.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.899
26 Federal Plaza, to be exact.

08:15.061 --> 08:18.201
<i>Based on their last location, there
are two direct routes into Manhattan.</i>

08:18.365 --> 08:21.039
The Long Island railroad and
the BQE to Brooklyn Bridge.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.738
HR will be patrolling
both spots heavily.

08:23.903 --> 08:26.816
So are you saying
Fusco and I need to split up?

08:26.973 --> 08:28.008
Is that Glasses?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.245
Tell him this is the last time
I chauffeur your ass.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.720
Divide and conquer,
I assume that's all right with you.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.916
<i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

08:52.098 --> 08:54.942
Somethings wrong
with your attack dog.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.604
He appears to be the smart one.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.127
Why are you still awake?

09:22.462 --> 09:24.567
Not bad dreams, I hope.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.478
I heard it said once
that a pregnant woman

09:30.637 --> 09:33.413
may see the face of
her unborn child in her dreams.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.719
I saw every digit,

09:39.079 --> 09:41.059
every line of code...

09:42.549 --> 09:44.290
...as I created it.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.064
But you've changed that,
haven't you?

09:48.254 --> 09:51.667
You found a way to alter the DNA
to rewrite the code.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.135
Is that how you get it
to speak to you?

09:55.595 --> 09:58.633
You have the relationship
with her that you wanted.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.170
She respects that.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.446
My relationship is more...

10:08.675 --> 10:10.348
...intimate.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.487
Sorry I asked.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.820
Why are you asking?
What's gotten you so upset?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.528
Is the big lug in trouble?

10:20.687 --> 10:22.667
Has his number finally come up?

10:24.624 --> 10:27.036
I don't really care
for the man myself,

10:27.193 --> 10:31.107
but he means
a great deal to you.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.540
So, if you can see it fit

10:36.703 --> 10:39.013
to set me free from this cage...

10:40.306 --> 10:43.685
I'll return him to you,
unharmed.

10:45.278 --> 10:48.225
How could I ever let you go

10:48.381 --> 10:50.292
when I know with
an almost absolute certainty

10:50.450 --> 10:52.225
that bad things will happen?

10:52.452 --> 10:55.490
Bad things
will happen regardless.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.465
The question is,

10:59.626 --> 11:02.232
are you going to let them happen
to your friend?

11:04.564 --> 11:06.908
Come on, Harry.

11:07.066 --> 11:10.411
Let's not pretend that John
is your first helper monkey.

11:12.872 --> 11:16.217
Exactly how many guys
did you go through before him?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.231
Pleasant dreams.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.742
Thanks for giving us a lift.

11:48.841 --> 11:52.254
Don't get too comfortable,
we'll be at the fed building soon.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.423
All right,
let's keep it moving.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.627
Petersen, surprised you
dragged your ass out of bed.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.361
I was told there was
a chance to shoot people.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.029
Imagine my disappointment,
suit's a no-show.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.731
Probably laying low.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.468
Doubt he's going to
stick his head out again.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.208
Our pal stormed a judge's house.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.316
Subtle he ain't.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.715
He's hiding, all right, but you
can bet it's in plain sight.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.423
Fusco?

12:32.585 --> 12:35.566
I haven't spotted our friends,
but I'm not the only one looking.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.999
Yeah, HR's got a checkpoint
at the Brooklyn Bridge too.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.157
No sign of our people.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.728
Hope they find their way
out of Dodge.

12:48.901 --> 12:50.346
Get us through.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.011
You can go about your night.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.247
Got a bus coming.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.853
Come on.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.945
Hey!
Hey, stop that ambulance!

13:23.202 --> 13:24.772
I'll take it from here.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.179
Aah!

13:29.976 --> 13:31.819
Heads up!

13:47.794 --> 13:49.364
Any luck finding our friends?

13:49.529 --> 13:52.032
If you mean by "luck," helping them
escape an HR checkpoint

13:52.198 --> 13:54.735
and bully their way
into Manhattan, then yes.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.082
Lionel?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.914
Detective Fusco,
are you all right?

14:04.143 --> 14:05.884
Game over, Lionel.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.084
What do you want to do
with him, boss?

14:12.919 --> 14:14.762
I got a few ideas.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.503
Reese and Carter broke through
HR's roadblock into Manhattan.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.270
They're on their way
to the fed building.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.277
I heard.
Thanks to Detective Fusco.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.177
Unfortunately,
he wasn't so lucky.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.045
I can find him,
but it might not matter.

14:34.207 --> 14:34.912
Might be dead by now.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.680
Remind me to hire an optimist
next time.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.882
Even an optimist can't be
two places at once.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.958
So what'll it be, Finch?

14:49.422 --> 14:51.629
Detective Fusco is currently
without any aid.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.791
Reese and Carter will have
to make do on their own.

14:53.815 --> 14:55.260
Locate the detective.

15:06.773 --> 15:07.911
Where the hell am I?

15:08.074 --> 15:10.816
Someplace no one
will hear you scream,

15:10.977 --> 15:13.116
since you'll be doing
a lot of that.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.391
Meet your new best friends.

15:21.154 --> 15:24.158
Petersen, right?
Always remember a pretty face.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.429
How about this?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.468
Look familiar?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.234
You emptied my pockets.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.970
Think there's some lint
in there too.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.445
You're a funny guy, Fusco.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.480
Must have had your ex-partner
in stitches.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.822
When's the last time
you saw Carter?

15:44.944 --> 15:48.016
I don't know.
Let me check my day planner.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.426
We know you met
with Carter tonight.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.436
She handed you something.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.974
Looked an awful lot like this.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.379
What does it open?

16:10.937 --> 16:14.009
See, Caner has information
on our organization,

16:14.173 --> 16:16.175
hidden it somewhere.

16:16.342 --> 16:18.879
From the size and shape
of this key,

16:19.045 --> 16:21.389
I'd say it opens up
a safe deposit box.

16:25.017 --> 16:27.122
It's my locker at the Y.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.629
You're welcome to my dirty jock.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.236
Unh!

16:42.735 --> 16:46.046
Hey, Fusco, want to know
your fortune? Huh?

16:49.075 --> 16:52.056
"You will be unusually
successful at your career."

16:52.211 --> 16:54.248
You know, I don't think
that one's true.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.589
"A thrilling time
is in your future."

16:59.752 --> 17:01.595
We're getting close now.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.435
Oh, here we go.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.368
"Tell your friends
what they want to know,

17:10.530 --> 17:13.670
or they will break you apart
limb by limb."

17:13.833 --> 17:15.436
That's more like it.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.843
So what's it going to be, Fusco?

17:32.018 --> 17:33.292
Courtesy of the driver.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.706
He's going to have one hell
of a headache when he wakes up.

17:35.730 --> 17:37.762
I did say I was sorry.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.598
Fed building's
just four blocks up.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.808
Looks like we're
late to our own party.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.104
We'll have to go in on foot.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.905
- Let's go.
- Come on.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.143
Hey, hold up.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.546
Come on, come on, come on.
Move!

17:58.811 --> 18:00.051
'Sup?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.322
- We got to get off the streets now.
- In here.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.846
Finch, could use
a little help here.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.110
<i>Mr. Reese, where are you?</i>

18:29.442 --> 18:33.413
Not my final stop, I hope.
City morgue, downtown.

18:34.513 --> 18:36.618
Go ahead, make yourself at home.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.863
HR has gangs
patrolling the street.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.464
<i>Can you send Lionel
to pick us up?</i>

18:41.621 --> 18:44.602
I'm afraid Detective Fusco
has been apprehended by HR.

18:44.757 --> 18:48.034
<i>Chances are, they're planning
to use him for leverage, or worse.</i>

18:48.194 --> 18:50.367
<i>We asked Ms. Shaw
to locate him.</i>

18:51.130 --> 18:53.041
They got Fusco, didn't they?

18:53.265 --> 18:56.838
Don't worry.
Shaw will find him.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.880
And if she doesn't?

19:02.775 --> 19:05.449
Nope, no sign of our boy.

19:05.511 --> 19:06.615
Mm-hmm.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.453
Oh, damn it.

19:17.990 --> 19:18.990
No!

19:20.726 --> 19:22.535
You know that's not
real meat, right?

19:22.695 --> 19:24.675
The hell...
Who are you?

19:25.364 --> 19:26.536
Concerned citizen.

19:26.699 --> 19:31.546
Our police force should really be
filling up on something more...

19:31.704 --> 19:33.581
substantial.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.343
Now...

19:36.409 --> 19:39.049
I want you to call
your pal Simmons

19:39.211 --> 19:42.215
and find out where he's keeping
Detective Fusco.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.921
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.225
Do it now...

19:50.356 --> 19:52.666
...or I lose the pin to this grenade...

19:52.758 --> 19:55.204
permanently.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.535
You don't understand.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.270
You might kill me,

20:02.435 --> 20:05.439
but I cross Simmons,

20:05.604 --> 20:07.777
he'll hunt down my wife,

20:08.741 --> 20:11.051
my sister.

20:11.277 --> 20:14.690
He won't stop
until everybody I love is dead.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.360
Please.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.464
Wait, I need that pin!

20:30.129 --> 20:32.040
<i>Federal Plaza.</i>

20:32.198 --> 20:35.873
Four blocks and only 15 rounds
of ammo between us.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.639
And who knows how many guys

20:39.805 --> 20:41.807
HR has hiding in the shadows?

20:41.974 --> 20:44.045
So we wait until sunup.

20:44.710 --> 20:48.214
Less likely they'll risk taking
a shot at us in broad daylight.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.826
Still haven't learned yet,
have you?

20:51.050 --> 20:55.590
There's no place you can hide.
No place my men won't...

20:58.724 --> 20:59.759
What was that?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.667
A sedative...
I think.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.507
Any ideas where to put him?

21:07.933 --> 21:09.776
Let the man rest in peace.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.114
Aah! Aah!

21:16.408 --> 21:18.251
See, I told you
we'd have you screaming.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.321
Where is the safe deposit box?

21:20.479 --> 21:22.618
Just tell him, get it over with.

21:36.262 --> 21:37.764
That the best you got?

21:38.531 --> 21:40.135
No.

21:40.332 --> 21:44.439
You know us, Lionel.
It's going to get so much worse.

21:47.706 --> 21:50.653
What are you going to do,
read some more fortune cookies?

21:50.776 --> 21:51.777
Huh?

21:52.711 --> 21:54.281
Bore me to death?

21:55.614 --> 21:57.719
See, that's the problem
with you, Fusco.

21:57.883 --> 22:01.797
You never listen.
It's like talking to a child.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.965
You have a kid, don't you?

22:06.058 --> 22:08.800
What's the little guy's name?
Lee.

22:11.463 --> 22:14.706
I feel sorry for that kid, I do.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.742
He's got defective genes,
just like you.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.812
You touch him,
and I'll send you to hell.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.749
Is that a promise?
Huh?

22:24.043 --> 22:26.922
Because when I make a promise,
I keep it.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.494
Where's the safe deposit box?
Which bank?

22:32.885 --> 22:34.922
Or I kill you and your kid.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.396
You know what?

22:40.226 --> 22:42.866
Put the kid out of his misery
before he turns out like his old man.

22:42.890 --> 22:44.130
Okay, okay, Okay!

22:48.601 --> 22:51.582
Bank's in Hoboken,
Jefferson and 9th,

22:51.737 --> 22:53.410
but it won't be open
this time of night.

22:53.572 --> 22:55.279
Oh, they'll be open for me.

22:59.745 --> 23:02.692
Sit on the kid while I get a warrant,
make sure he's telling the truth.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.224
Keep an eye on Detective Fusco.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.520
What do you got?

23:09.622 --> 23:11.397
I got a line
on the man in the suit.

23:11.624 --> 23:15.766
Thought he gave us the slip.
Then we saw this.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.802
He's holed up with the stiffs
in the city morgue.

23:18.864 --> 23:22.903
Good, saves us the trip.
Rally the troops.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.764
Care package for the road?

23:42.955 --> 23:48.234
Fifteen rounds, bone saw, scalpel,
some assorted tools.

23:50.663 --> 23:55.009
You do realize we gotta kill HR
before we can autopsy them.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.772
Apply the right amount of force,
this can do some damage.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.920
Hezbollah surgeon.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.853
Two more inches to the left,

24:07.012 --> 24:10.016
would've cut right
through my axillary artery.

24:14.853 --> 24:20.804
Fallujah. 300-pound gorilla
of a Marine escorting me.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.939
One minute,
we're walking on patrol,

24:23.095 --> 24:24.870
and the next, I hear a click.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.100
Land mine?

24:26.265 --> 24:30.179
Guy looked right into my eyes,
then he was dust.

24:30.336 --> 24:31.940
Never saw it coming.

24:32.171 --> 24:35.050
When your time is up, it's up.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.219
That's a close call.

24:38.377 --> 24:39.879
Yeah.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.150
Was that your closest?

24:43.382 --> 24:45.123
Thirteen stitches.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.888
How'd the other guy fare?

24:47.052 --> 24:49.464
Touch and go for a while.

24:49.621 --> 24:53.068
It was a C-section.
Taylor was breech.

24:53.225 --> 24:56.069
Doctors weren't sure if he was
going to make it or not,

24:56.228 --> 24:58.731
had to rush me into surgery.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.578
It was the worst moment
of my life,

25:02.735 --> 25:04.305
followed by the best.

25:07.706 --> 25:11.085
What about you, John?
What was your closest?

25:20.419 --> 25:23.992
- That's got somebody's name on it?
- Mine.

25:26.558 --> 25:29.266
There was a time I thought
about saying good-bye.

25:31.096 --> 25:33.007
Lost someone.

25:36.568 --> 25:37.945
Lost myself.

25:40.606 --> 25:42.950
What happened?
What stopped you?

25:44.777 --> 25:47.621
I got in a fight
with some punks on a subway.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.451
Cop detained me.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.697
He brought me to you.

25:59.425 --> 26:01.803
You changed my mind, Joss.

26:12.438 --> 26:14.714
You changed me.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.761
<i>Mr. Reese,
I have some alarming news.</i>

26:17.785 --> 26:19.484
<i>I've been monitoring
the police scanners.</i>

26:19.645 --> 26:22.319
<i>Someone has reported suspicious
activity at the morgue.</i>

26:22.481 --> 26:25.826
I suggest you leave
by the southwest emergency exit.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.790
Doesn't look like we're
going to be leaving anytime soon.

26:30.956 --> 26:32.560
We're surrounded.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.336
Next, they'll lock down
the building,

26:38.497 --> 26:41.137
seal us off
from witnesses, everyone.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.611
HR's moving in for the kill.
Here we go.

26:56.915 --> 26:57.985
You three, flush them out.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.185
Hey, what's going on?

26:59.351 --> 27:02.423
We got some reports, some vandals
have broken in the back, sir.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.158
Reports? From who?
It's just me.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.825
Cuff him.

27:05.991 --> 27:07.334
Hey, you can't do that.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.645
Make sure the rent-a-cop
keeps his mouth shut,

27:18.804 --> 27:20.215
and watch the front.

27:25.711 --> 27:27.190
Think that'll hold them?

27:27.346 --> 27:29.849
It's going to have to.

27:32.784 --> 27:35.560
Spread out.
They're here somewhere.

27:47.232 --> 27:48.905
Breakfast.

27:49.067 --> 27:50.569
It's 4:00 in the morning.

27:50.736 --> 27:54.912
I may not be back in time.
I may not be back at all.

27:55.140 --> 27:58.713
I can't imagine
what it must be like for you.

27:58.877 --> 28:01.915
After all this time,
to have to let go of your creation.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.253
The Machine is still sending us
numbers, Ms. Groves.

28:04.416 --> 28:07.192
I wasn't talking
about The Machine.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.527
John.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.532
It's not too late.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.331
I can help you stop
whatever's about to happen.

28:15.494 --> 28:18.168
Please let me help you.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.444
Good-bye, Ms. Groves.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.516
I understand.

28:26.672 --> 28:29.084
I hope someday you'll trust me.

28:34.179 --> 28:36.625
I'm so sorry for your loss, Harold.

28:56.368 --> 28:57.369
<i>Checked out the bank.</i>

28:57.803 --> 28:59.248
Good news and bad news.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.974
Bad news is Fusco lied.

29:01.139 --> 29:03.210
Good news is
you get to kill him.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.321
Sounds fun.
What about the evidence?

29:05.477 --> 29:07.150
We still have the key.

29:07.312 --> 29:09.815
Only a matter of time
before we find the right bank.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.928
And the kid?

29:12.084 --> 29:16.089
Look, I'll tell him
where it's at, I swear.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.235
Look who finally wants to talk.

29:18.390 --> 29:22.668
You tell Fusco I made him
a promise, and I keep my word.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.007
Waste them both.

29:34.673 --> 29:36.778
They're tossing rooms.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.354
Won't be long
until they find us.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.691
Check the supply closet.

29:44.850 --> 29:47.330
Might be some chemicals
that'll come in handy.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.208
John?

30:16.948 --> 30:20.623
John! John!
Don't do this!

30:23.522 --> 30:25.559
I'm sorry, Joss,
but I can't lose you.

30:25.791 --> 30:26.861
They'll kill you.

30:27.059 --> 30:30.165
They'll try, I'm counting on it.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.689
Listen, I'm going to
draw them out.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.337
You make a run for it
with Quinn.

30:34.399 --> 30:36.640
Anything happens to you,

30:37.669 --> 30:41.515
I swear...
I'll hate you forever.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.684
You're stuck with me, remember?

30:46.078 --> 30:48.581
You make sure Quinn gets
what he deserves.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.093
See you on the other side.

31:05.897 --> 31:08.070
Hey, you got the kid?

31:08.233 --> 31:09.837
Yeah, I got him.

31:10.001 --> 31:12.277
<i>His piece-of-garbage dad lied.</i>

31:14.206 --> 31:15.708
<i>You know what to do.</i>

31:17.609 --> 31:20.715
I don't care what you do to me,
just let my kid go.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.960
Tell you what,
I'll let you say your good-byes.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.693
Put the kid on the line.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.730
<i>Let Fusco listen in
while you do it.</i>

31:33.925 --> 31:35.962
Last words, make them count.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.734
<i>Dad?</i>

31:37.863 --> 31:39.638
Lee?

31:39.798 --> 31:40.936
Lee...

31:41.099 --> 31:43.579
<i>it's gonna be okay.</i>

31:44.436 --> 31:45.710
<i>I'm right here with you, okay?</i>

31:45.871 --> 31:48.579
I'm right here with you.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.819
Just close your eyes, all right?

31:53.111 --> 31:54.988
I love you.
It's gonna be okay.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.268
<i>Lionel.</i>

32:10.128 --> 32:12.404
It is gonna be okay.

32:13.799 --> 32:16.678
Lee is fine, but the guy they sent
to kill him isn't doing so good.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.941
<i>Figured these scumbags
would come after your kid.</i>

32:23.675 --> 32:26.019
Thank you, thank you.

32:27.078 --> 32:28.318
<i>But, Lionel...</i>

32:29.748 --> 32:33.286
...you understand this means
I can't be there for you.

32:35.353 --> 32:36.798
I had to choose.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.663
Figured you'd want me
to come here instead.

32:42.027 --> 32:44.633
Yeah, you did good.
You did good.

32:48.033 --> 32:49.842
I'm sorry, Lionel.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.033
Looks like your fortune's run out.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.570
Never did have very good luck.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.833
Turns out neither did
Officer Miller.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.702
My friend killed him.
My boy is fine.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.213
Doesn't change your fate.
I got a full mag.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.509
The only question is
where to shoot first?

33:27.672 --> 33:29.379
Ever kill someone, Petersen?

33:29.541 --> 33:30.542
Not recently.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.211
Can't take down
a group of bent cops

33:32.377 --> 33:34.015
without having casualties.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.090
Someone was always
going to end up in a casket.

33:36.248 --> 33:39.024
Truth is, guys like you and me,

33:39.184 --> 33:41.144
we're all going to catch a bullet
sooner or later.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.257
Best you can hope for
is someone to hold your hand

33:43.421 --> 33:44.729
while you bleed out.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.528
Oh, that's sweet.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.433
You want me
to hold your hand, Fusco?

33:49.594 --> 33:51.733
Oh, I forgot,
we broke your fingers.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.932
Yeah, you did.

33:54.099 --> 33:56.875
Which made it no big deal
for me to break my thumb.

34:33.471 --> 34:34.643
Can I help you?

34:34.806 --> 34:37.126
Officer Simmons said you might
be in need of my assistance.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.583
Yeah?
Who are you?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.783
I'm the guy that's going to
catch you when you fall.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.984
Sorry, I'm not very good at this.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.138
I know they're here.
Find them!

35:07.772 --> 35:08.944
Aah!

35:28.326 --> 35:29.828
There he is!
Shoot him!

35:36.835 --> 35:38.473
Son of a bitch.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.796
Come on, come on.
Follow me, damn it.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.071
Finch, I'm out of bullets
and out of time.

36:09.072 --> 36:10.910
Make sure Carter gets to safety.

36:11.069 --> 36:12.412
<i>Will do, Mr. Reese.</i>

36:19.878 --> 36:23.655
<i>Detective Carter,
the area is clear.</i>

36:23.815 --> 36:26.921
<i>You are free now
to exit the building.</i>

36:31.256 --> 36:33.930
Hey, wake up.
We're checking out.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.432
Come on.

36:47.105 --> 36:48.379
Hold it right there!

36:48.540 --> 36:50.281
Do you have a weapon, sir?
Are you armed?

36:50.442 --> 36:51.642
<i>Mr. Reese, are you okay?</i>

36:51.776 --> 36:53.050
Yes, I am.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.122
Got a tip that a man
matching your description

36:55.280 --> 36:56.418
was brandishing a weapon.

36:56.581 --> 37:00.051
I somehow managed to locate
two of NYPD's honest cops.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.788
You have the right to remain silent.

37:01.953 --> 37:04.627
Anything you say can be held
against you. Do you understand?

37:04.789 --> 37:06.700
<i>I assumed you'd prefer
incarceration to death.</i>

37:06.858 --> 37:08.804
I do, and thanks.

37:23.274 --> 37:26.812
You'll never get a conviction,
not in my city.

37:27.979 --> 37:31.324
This used to be your city.
Not anymore.

37:38.656 --> 37:41.830
Officer Carter.
This is Alonzo Quinn.

38:20.865 --> 38:22.208
<i>New York City's
Police Department</i>

38:22.267 --> 38:23.541
<i>has been rocked this morning</i>

38:23.668 --> 38:25.788
<i>- with the arrest of Alonzo Quinn.
- Alonzo Quinn</i>

38:25.812 --> 38:28.583
<i>has been booked on suspicion
of being the ringleader of HR.</i>

38:28.773 --> 38:31.276
<i>Police are still searching
for Officer Patrick Simmons,</i>

38:31.442 --> 38:34.048
<i>who they believe is
Quinn's second-in-command.</i>

38:42.120 --> 38:44.066
Congratulations, Detective.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.399
It is Detective again, isn't it?

38:46.558 --> 38:48.128
Can't say I miss the uniform.

38:48.293 --> 38:51.570
It seems John Doe is being
held at the Third Precinct.

38:51.729 --> 38:53.731
My lawyers are trying
to extricate him.

38:53.898 --> 38:57.209
Let's just hope John can stay
out of trouble for a long while.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.313
Or has your computer
told you otherwise?

39:02.006 --> 39:03.542
What did you say?

39:04.676 --> 39:05.814
How else could you know

39:06.010 --> 39:08.684
when someone's
about to be in trouble?

39:08.847 --> 39:11.327
I just figured you built
some sort of supercomputer

39:11.482 --> 39:14.588
that can siphon information
from government feeds.

39:14.719 --> 39:15.720
I'm impressed.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.264
I am a detective.

39:18.823 --> 39:20.769
Speaking of which, duty calls.

39:20.925 --> 39:23.269
I'll drop by the Third, make
sure our friend gets released.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.772
I'd appreciate that, Joss.

39:29.767 --> 39:31.246
Shouldn't you be at work?

39:31.402 --> 39:33.075
Nice to talk to you, too.

39:33.238 --> 39:36.117
I'll be in later.
Keep my seat warm.

39:37.909 --> 39:41.220
And, nice to have you back, partner.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.518
Glad to be back.
I'll see you soon.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.896
Chip off the old block, huh?
Looks like he's doing okay.

39:51.022 --> 39:53.093
You, on the other hand,
look like crap.

39:55.627 --> 39:56.765
Heard you took a bullet.

39:56.928 --> 39:59.248
Yeah, stupid bastard shot me
where I had plenty of padding.

39:59.364 --> 40:01.241
Would have gone
for the head shot myself.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.470
Course, you got
plenty of padding there, too.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.114
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.287
Thank you, truly.

40:15.780 --> 40:17.657
Shut up and drive, Lionel.

40:33.965 --> 40:37.105
I'm Carter.
You didn't give us a name.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.939
Seems like the only time
you need a name now

40:40.104 --> 40:42.106
is when you're in trouble.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.810
So...

40:44.976 --> 40:46.649
...am I in trouble?

40:51.649 --> 40:53.686
Got your man locked up, Carter.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.296
Must feel good.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.488
Not all of them.

40:56.654 --> 40:59.828
Still haven't been able
to locate our pal Simmons.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.998
Can't hide forever.
We'll get him.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.297
All right, where's my weapon?

41:06.497 --> 41:08.534
John Doe didn't have a permit.

41:09.867 --> 41:12.711
Your gun's property
of the NYPD now.

41:12.937 --> 41:15.474
Time I got some new hardware.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.119
Looks like your ride is here.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.952
Guess we were all worried
about you.

41:24.549 --> 41:27.189
If my number was up,

41:27.352 --> 41:28.888
I'm just glad I was with you.

41:36.394 --> 41:38.874
No one I'd rather be with
at the end.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.410
Your time's up.

41:42.567 --> 41:43.978
Told you I'd end you.

41:45.203 --> 41:47.547
No, not today!

41:53.811 --> 41:57.418
Joss, Joss, I'm here.

42:02.387 --> 42:04.367
It's okay.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.593
I need...
I need to see my boy.

42:07.592 --> 42:08.832
I need to tell him...

42:08.993 --> 42:10.438
And you will, and you will.

42:10.595 --> 42:12.575
Just stay with me.

42:16.334 --> 42:19.577
Promise me
you'll look in on him.

42:20.772 --> 42:22.852
I won't have to 'cause
you're going to make it, okay?

42:23.007 --> 42:25.044
Promise me you'll tell him.

42:28.913 --> 42:30.517
He knows, Joss.

42:32.016 --> 42:33.518
He knows.

42:34.285 --> 42:36.026
John...

42:37.355 --> 42:38.857
...don't let this...

42:44.862 --> 42:46.466
Joss, come...
