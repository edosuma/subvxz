WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:02.915
Previously on Z Nation.

00:03.960 --> 00:05.092
Don't move!

00:05.396 --> 00:06.136
Addy.

00:07.529 --> 00:10.053
A great idea
is worth more than you think.

00:10.314 --> 00:12.229
We got to find more bizkits

00:12.273 --> 00:15.319
before every Talker turns
in Newmerica.

00:15.798 --> 00:19.454
Promise me you will not
hand him over to Altura.

00:19.497 --> 00:20.629
I promise.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.239
We're searching for one
Lieutenant Dante.

00:22.979 --> 00:23.675
Up here!

00:23.719 --> 00:25.112
I'll let you take me.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.549
I need to go after him.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.814
I need to be there at his trial.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.829
So what do you know
about this bakery?

00:46.872 --> 00:48.526
Supposedly it's where they bake
the bizkits.

00:48.570 --> 00:51.268
So why the big mystery around
these bizkits anyway?

00:51.312 --> 00:53.401
Nobody likes to talk about
the fact that they contain

00:53.444 --> 00:54.837
human brain matter.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.578
Well where are they getting
the brains from then?

00:56.621 --> 00:57.361
No one knows.

00:57.405 --> 00:59.102
It's time we find out.

00:59.146 --> 01:02.062
Brain bizkits? How was this
not your idea, Murphy?

01:02.105 --> 01:03.628
Laugh it up, stump boy.

01:03.672 --> 01:04.934
One of these days,

01:04.977 --> 01:07.458
this Apocalypse is gonna make me
a rich man.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.680
You head back in now, okay?

01:11.723 --> 01:12.594
Hey.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.858
Try not to eat each other
before I get back, all right?

01:19.166 --> 01:21.777
The bizkit bakery is on the edge
of the No-Go Zone.

01:21.820 --> 01:24.040
Not the type of place
that welcomes visitors.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.435
Let me point out a few obvious
red flags.

01:27.478 --> 01:30.133
Backwood yocals,
secret brain bakery,

01:30.177 --> 01:33.658
and I'm sure I hear banjo music
in our near future.

01:33.702 --> 01:34.877
Need I go on?

01:36.226 --> 01:37.880
You guys follow Dante to Altura.

01:37.923 --> 01:40.100
I'm sure you'll make sure
he has a fair trial.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.624
We'll get the bizkits, get back
to Limbo, and we'll join you.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.799
We're on it, chief.

01:45.279 --> 01:47.542
All right. Well I assembled
the best of the Limbo fleet.

01:47.585 --> 01:48.151
There you go.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.021
Sweet.

01:51.502 --> 01:52.547
My bad.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.767
Does this run?

01:55.811 --> 01:57.813
I'm a god, not a mechanic.

01:57.856 --> 02:01.295
Well it's no El Camino,
but beggars can't be choosers.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.818
El Camino.

02:09.999 --> 02:12.610
Wow, they don't make them
like they used to.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.134
They don't make anything.

02:14.482 --> 02:15.744
At all.

02:17.006 --> 02:18.138
True that.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.538
Let's find that bakery.

02:27.799 --> 02:31.673
Can you step on it, Doc? I don't
like not having eyes on Dante.

02:33.414 --> 02:34.154
Really?

02:35.807 --> 02:36.982
I'm gunning it.

02:40.595 --> 02:43.032
You know you shouldn't
put your feet up like that.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.165
If there was an accident,
the airbags could go off

02:45.208 --> 02:47.167
and you could drive your
knees up into your brain.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.603
It's the Apocalypse.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.822
I think airbags
are the least of our worries.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.042
It's one of those fears
you have growing up, I guess.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.131
Your generation's greatest fear
was airbags?

02:55.827 --> 02:57.568
My generation only had zombies.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.570
I'm just saying
30 something year old airbags

02:59.614 --> 03:01.398
are not typically
the most reliable.

03:01.442 --> 03:02.878
Not that anything's
gonna happen.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.096
Shit!

03:12.801 --> 03:14.106
And you were saying?

03:15.238 --> 03:19.938
[electric guitar theme music

03:19.982 --> 03:22.071
♪ Have mercy...

03:23.986 --> 03:31.515
♪ Oh, have mercy. ♪

03:32.951 --> 03:36.303
Nope, still don't make them
like they used to.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.522
I think I sprained my ankle.

03:38.566 --> 03:40.568
Better than a knee
through the brain.

03:40.611 --> 03:41.830
No, it's not.

03:41.873 --> 03:45.094
Let me see what I got in my bag
for pain.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.142
I don't like to prescribe
the hard stuff

03:50.186 --> 03:52.449
when this stuff
will do you just fine.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.681
I've never smoked before.

04:06.724 --> 04:09.074
Good, it's a terrible habit.
Stunts your growth.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.467
What?

04:10.511 --> 04:13.165
Oh, I was thinking nicotine.
No, fire that puppy up.

04:13.209 --> 04:14.776
Can you move it at all?

04:14.819 --> 04:16.473
No. Oh god.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.693
Well look, tough it out
or take a hit.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.738
But don't just let it burn out.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.612
Here, let me have a look at it.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.309
Okay, the weed,
the weed.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.005
Here, here.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.445
I don't think you broke it,
but you damn sure sprained it.

04:32.663 --> 04:35.405
Now my foot hurts
and I have a cough.

04:35.449 --> 04:36.841
Give it a minute.

04:40.105 --> 04:43.021
Uh oh. You hang tough. I'm gonna
take care of some tourists.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.507
Poncho Zs?

05:04.478 --> 05:06.654
Cars used to have ashtrays?

05:18.753 --> 05:19.536
Look out, George!

05:19.580 --> 05:20.624
Where you going?

05:23.888 --> 05:25.847
Uh, okay, okay.

05:28.502 --> 05:29.720
A little help here!

05:33.855 --> 05:35.596
Okay, I got you.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.170
Mercy.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.046
Oh god.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.528
Well I guess that spleef
is working.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.356
Can't feel my foot.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.359
I don't feel anything.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.100
We better get going.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.712
I want to get to Altura
before nightfall.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.540
Ruh-oh.

06:07.715 --> 06:08.629
Ew.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.371
You better have a seat
and get off that foot.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.894
This could take a while.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.690
Is that the bakery?

06:26.734 --> 06:27.865
It looks abandoned.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.826
Doesn't mean nobody's home.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.830
What is it?

06:35.873 --> 06:37.614
This must be the place.

06:37.658 --> 06:38.876
I smell brains.

06:50.497 --> 06:51.715
Murphy?

06:52.499 --> 06:54.588
Get your ass
away from them skulls.

06:54.631 --> 06:55.415
Hey.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.590
Focus.

07:50.731 --> 07:53.081
Looks like they left in a hurry.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.608
Guess this clears up any mystery

07:58.652 --> 08:01.176
of what the secret ingredient
might be.

08:10.359 --> 08:13.667
Doesn't look like it's been
operational for a while.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.558
Are we done?

08:35.602 --> 08:36.603
I dunno.

08:36.907 --> 08:39.257
I can't figure this shit out.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.436
You catching up
on your social studies?

08:45.655 --> 08:48.615
You know it's crazy, when I was
in school I kept thinking,

08:48.658 --> 08:51.313
when am I ever gonna use
this stuff in real life?

08:51.356 --> 08:53.010
Now's your chance.

08:53.054 --> 08:56.274
I love history.
Especially when I'm buzzed.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.581
My old man
was a big history buff.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.888
Had a huge collection of books.

09:02.454 --> 09:03.717
But my favorite

09:03.760 --> 09:07.111
was this painting of the
Constitutional Convention.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.678
Yeah, the gang was all there.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.767
Ben Franklin

09:11.420 --> 09:13.248
chillin' in the middle.

09:14.728 --> 09:17.600
George Washington
presiding over it all,

09:17.644 --> 09:20.081
with Thomas Jefferson
looking all badass.

09:21.909 --> 09:22.562
You know,

09:23.693 --> 09:25.956
the founding fathers
had huge pot farms.

09:27.610 --> 09:28.698
Seriously.

09:32.702 --> 09:35.444
They were like man,
cannabis rules.

09:37.489 --> 09:40.057
You know, these hemp fibers are
pretty much good for anything.

09:40.101 --> 09:43.974
Rope, banners, printing the
Bible, making the US flag,

09:44.018 --> 09:45.672
the paper of the Constitution.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.978
Yeah, I know, George.
I'm from the 1700's too.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.850
I got this strand from France.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.982
It's good for gout
and migraines

09:52.026 --> 09:54.637
and expanding your mind,
oh and tooth aches.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.856
Tooth aches, you say?

10:00.077 --> 10:02.427
Who's getting icky
with the sticky?

10:02.863 --> 10:06.083
I cultivated it,
but I did not inhale.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.824
It smells French.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.089
South of Marseille.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.525
May I?

10:14.048 --> 10:17.399
Ah... Sorry, we ran out
of matches.

10:17.442 --> 10:20.010
Ah, then we must invent one.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.250
Woo! Felt that one
down in my toes.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.469
I'm surprised those guys
got anything done,

10:44.513 --> 10:45.906
not to mention
started a country.

10:45.949 --> 10:46.907
How are we doing?

10:46.950 --> 10:48.560
We're approved for liftoff.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.223
Somebody turned that oven on.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.790
And I'm guessing it wasn't
Betty Crocker.

11:00.834 --> 11:01.922
Good guess.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.620
We're definitely not here alone.

11:38.654 --> 11:39.699
It's clear.

11:40.830 --> 11:41.483
Hey,

11:42.963 --> 11:44.181
you okay?

11:45.705 --> 11:46.836
I'm fine.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.404
Okay. Just checking.

11:51.406 --> 11:52.407
Lefty.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.106
Come on, Cyclops.

11:56.150 --> 11:59.022
Oh no, after you,
Captain Hookless.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.464
Look, I don't want to pry.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.772
But dammit, I dunno.

12:09.816 --> 12:13.167
I don't know
why things have to be so hard.

12:13.645 --> 12:19.434
In between Mack and Lucy, my eye
is the least of what I've lost.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.745
I can still feel my hand
in my dreams.

12:26.833 --> 12:30.575
I carry heavy gear
and lace my shoes,

12:32.664 --> 12:34.275
hold her hands.

12:34.841 --> 12:35.755
Shoot my gun.

12:36.973 --> 12:40.368
It's like having a friend
that was there

12:42.196 --> 12:43.937
but isn't anymore.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.722
You know what I mean.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.725
Yeah, I know what you mean.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.164
Hey, buddy?

12:54.861 --> 12:55.818
You okay?

12:56.558 --> 12:57.689
Yeah,

12:59.169 --> 13:01.911
just all these brains laying
around give me the munchies.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.827
Gonna need to stay hungry.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.809
Intruders!

13:31.071 --> 13:32.202
Don't worry, brother!
I'm coming for you!

13:42.299 --> 13:43.518
Brother!

14:16.899 --> 14:17.552
Psst.

15:11.171 --> 15:11.911
No.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.392
No, ma'am.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.480
No, ma'am.

15:16.524 --> 15:17.090
Sorry, ma'am.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.011
Sit.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.535
You're quite the handyman, Doc.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.972
Yeah, well just think of me

15:30.016 --> 15:33.062
as the Ben Franklin
of paraphernalia.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.196
Okay, Mr. Franklin.

15:37.197 --> 15:40.113
So what's the difference
between the Constitution

15:40.156 --> 15:42.071
and the Bill of Rights?

15:42.115 --> 15:43.638
Well, the way I heard it,

15:43.681 --> 15:46.162
everyone was so excited
about writing the rules

15:46.206 --> 15:47.642
for running the government,

15:47.685 --> 15:50.601
they forgot about the people
that the government was for.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.997
Let's just sign this sucker.
Get the party started.

15:55.041 --> 15:58.958
I would rather chop my
right hand off than sign that!

15:59.523 --> 16:02.004
This government
that we've created

16:02.874 --> 16:06.008
may protect us
from foreign enemies.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.445
But, gentlemen...

16:08.489 --> 16:10.839
Oh yeah, my bad.
No zombies back then.

16:11.622 --> 16:15.583
Ask yourself, who will protect
us from our government?

16:15.931 --> 16:17.977
We need a Bill of Rights!

16:18.020 --> 16:19.630
We're back to work, everyone.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.981
I just opened
the Chateau de Chassilier.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.374
Not my fault, quaker oats man!

16:25.549 --> 16:27.377
In order for this nation
to work,

16:27.421 --> 16:29.249
individuals need to understand

16:29.292 --> 16:32.034
their inalienable rights
as citizens

16:32.078 --> 16:35.733
and know how their government
will protect them.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.303
Okay, well do you,
smarty

16:41.913 --> 16:42.914
A few.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.574
Freedom of press,
freedom of religion,

16:50.618 --> 16:51.880
public release of knowledge

16:51.923 --> 16:54.230
of alien life forms
and or technology.

16:54.274 --> 16:57.625
Okay, I can see some of these
going into the Constitution.

16:57.668 --> 17:00.062
Hey T.J.,
you're a rights kinda guy.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.108
Write this up.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.805
But I wrote the Constitution.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.242
We wrote the Constitution.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.462
Uh, no, I physically wrote...

17:08.505 --> 17:09.463
Hey, James Madison!

17:10.029 --> 17:11.421
What's up, puff ball.

17:11.465 --> 17:14.163
Hey, can you just like pick ten
and write them up?

17:14.207 --> 17:15.425
Here you go. Here you go.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.209
Thanks.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.864
Off to it, puddin' pants.

17:19.908 --> 17:23.346
Great. Great.
We're making progress.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.523
We're all making lots of
great progress.

17:26.567 --> 17:29.135
Hey, you got some more
of that waky

17:32.225 --> 17:35.097
So what makes the Bill of Rights
so important?

17:36.316 --> 17:40.059
Well it's your god-given rights
based simply on your humanity.

17:40.363 --> 17:43.062
Unfortunately, the definition
of humanity changed

17:43.105 --> 17:45.934
with the definition
of mortality.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.371
Well, that's one way
of thinking about it.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.286
But you know,
humanity's also like

17:50.330 --> 17:52.549
compassion and brotherly love.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.639
Like, take that dude
for example.

17:55.683 --> 17:57.293
Now,

17:57.337 --> 17:59.165
what makes us different from him
when it comes to basic decency?

17:59.208 --> 18:03.038
Does he deserve to be treated
any different than you or I?

18:03.082 --> 18:06.259
No. He has the same right
to live his life

18:06.302 --> 18:07.390
without worrying about
the government

18:07.434 --> 18:08.739
coming and taking his stuff,

18:08.783 --> 18:11.568
locking him up,
and censoring his words.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.570
That's a zombie.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.530
Yeah. That's...that's
a bad example.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.575
But you know
what I'm getting at.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.669
It's knowing that you have
the power, not the government.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.584
And it's the government's job
to protect your rights,

18:27.628 --> 18:29.238
not infringe on 'em.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.547
People are so afraid, they'll
do anything the government says.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.505
Like locking up the Talkers.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.203
Yeah, well that's when you need
a Bill of Rights,

18:37.246 --> 18:39.727
when people are afraid and
they don't know what's right.

18:40.510 --> 18:43.383
But what's gonna protect Dante
without a Bill of Rights?

18:44.253 --> 18:45.036
We are.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.814
I'm gonna give yous the same
choice I gave the last goons

19:23.858 --> 19:25.729
that came through here
and tried to shut us down.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.515
Chocolate or vanilla?

19:28.558 --> 19:30.517
Mercy or Talker.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.217
I could ask you
the same question.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.924
I don't want to hurt you.
But I will.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.666
Looks like we've got ourselves
a zombie standoff.

19:49.710 --> 19:53.540
Yous got me, I got him,
and me brudder's got you both.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.543
We're looking for bizkits.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.241
We have starving Talkers
that are starting to turn.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.938
Look, we're just trying
to survive ourselves.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.592
It's crooks like you
that shut down the bakery

20:02.636 --> 20:04.159
and turned us into
a bunch of dirty dogs.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.117
Lower your weapons
and kindly waltz out of here

20:06.161 --> 20:07.728
or we're all going to be
craving brains.

20:07.771 --> 20:10.165
Look, I don't know who you think
we are. But we are not them.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.820
That's what the last bunch said
before they started shooting.

20:16.606 --> 20:19.696
Is that the other brudder
that's got us covered?

20:19.740 --> 20:22.046
Hey, buddy. Dat you, brudder?

20:22.786 --> 20:24.266
Hey, buddy.

20:24.310 --> 20:27.617
This crazy woman here done
bust me right in the honker.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.577
Your brudder's still human.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.840
Let's keep it that way.

20:35.016 --> 20:38.411
So, you's are in need
of some help, are you?

20:42.850 --> 20:46.506
Ay, by' watch out for the
one-eyed one. She's not nice.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.029
Not at all.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.291
She's mean like a badger.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.380
I thought you people
spoke English in Canada.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.338
We do's.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.209
You do's?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.515
Besides, ain't no Canada.
Not no more anywho.

20:55.558 --> 20:58.169
Yeah, no 'Merica neither
it seems.

20:58.561 --> 20:59.562
Pardon our manners.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.304
I'm Gilly. That there's
my brudder, Skull.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.262
Skully for short.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.220
But that's longer.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.658
Okay, so look, we heard rumors
that you guys bake bizkits here.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.791
Dat's no rumor. Dat's the truth.

21:10.834 --> 21:14.447
Well no offense, but you look
more like butchers than bakers.

21:14.490 --> 21:15.361
Thanks.

21:17.537 --> 21:18.842
You're welcome.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.235
We need bizkits.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.193
Lots of them.

21:22.237 --> 21:23.978
Well for dat, you're gonna
have to talk to me mum.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.501
She's in charge of the baking.

21:25.806 --> 21:27.460
Where might she be?

21:27.764 --> 21:28.504
Mum?

21:28.722 --> 21:30.550
Mum's up dare in the office.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.991
Okay. Can we talk to her?

21:38.166 --> 21:40.429
Well let's just go take
a little looky

21:40.473 --> 21:42.997
See what kind of mood she's in.

21:43.650 --> 21:46.957
It's not as easy as all that,
now is it brudder?

21:48.219 --> 21:49.873
No brudder, it isn't.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.921
After the Black Rains,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.098
we was on our way to Newmerica,

21:57.141 --> 22:00.101
and we got turned arse
over tea kettle by a pack of Zs.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.015
Our brudder Brenton

22:02.408 --> 22:03.496
got all riled up
and he mercied a bunch of them,

22:03.539 --> 22:04.801
but those Zs
took a right bite outta him.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.368
Yeah, he was a goner for sure.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.588
Yeah, I mean they really filled
their boots with his belly,

22:08.631 --> 22:09.893
but he never turned.

22:09.937 --> 22:11.721
Aye, he started acting a bit
rummy and dead-like,

22:11.765 --> 22:12.983
but he was still talking.

22:13.027 --> 22:15.769
So we figured he isn't dead,
he's just sickish.

22:15.812 --> 22:18.249
Yeah, see it wasn't till mum
caught him sneaking brains

22:18.293 --> 22:20.469
that we realized he's
one of these Talker guys.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.037
Yeah, mum got real tired of him
sneaking off to get brains.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.823
So she baked up some roadkill
brains into a bizkit for him.

22:26.867 --> 22:29.696
And the more he ate, the more he
was like the brudder we knew.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.960
See, the bizkits
kept him Canadian.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.442
Pretty soon,
everybody wanted mum's bizkits.

22:36.485 --> 22:37.704
So we set up the bakery.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.749
Okay, so what happened?
Why'd y'all stop?

22:39.793 --> 22:42.056
Well, everything
was poutine and pie

22:42.099 --> 22:43.579
until somebody blew up the vote.

22:43.623 --> 22:46.147
And we've been under attack
from Zs

22:46.190 --> 22:47.757
from out of nowhere ever since.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.543
Sounds like someone
didn't want you making bizkits.

22:50.586 --> 22:51.282
Yeah.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.764
We thought yous was them
come back to finish us off.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.984
So if your mom has this
secret recipe,

22:57.027 --> 22:58.464
why can't we just
make more bizkits?

22:58.507 --> 23:00.379
Well you'll have to talk to mum
about that.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.816
But she ain't been herself since
our little brudder bit her.

23:05.558 --> 23:09.257
You might say she's a bit cranky
herself without her bizkits.

23:09.300 --> 23:12.391
We had to lock mum up in the
office for her own good.

23:12.826 --> 23:13.522
Since then,

23:15.089 --> 23:15.829
the three of us have been
trying to work out the recipe

23:15.872 --> 23:17.091
but come up short.

23:17.134 --> 23:17.874
Three?

23:19.006 --> 23:19.572
Oh yeah, we had another brudder,
Chilly.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.792
He was with us till he tried
to take the recipe off mum.

23:22.836 --> 23:23.924
So where's he now?

23:29.320 --> 23:30.409
Let me guess.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.367
He didn't get the recipe?

23:32.411 --> 23:35.370
Gilly, look at the big brains
on Red over here.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.851
Hey, hey. Easy.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.287
Easy. Okay, look.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.681
Mum's got the only
copy of the recipe on her.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.378
Okay, she turned
about two weeks ago.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.076
Okay, Gilly and I
are running out of options here.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.905
How's a fella supposed to be
getting on like this, eh?

23:49.297 --> 23:51.821
Those deadish bastards
turned our mum and brudders.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.439
Nor be deprived of life,

24:00.482 --> 24:03.529
liberty, or property,
without due process of the law.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.445
How are we gonna make sure
Dante gets due process

24:06.488 --> 24:07.794
when there are vigilantes
out there

24:07.837 --> 24:10.884
that think Talkers are
more zombie than human?

24:10.927 --> 24:12.276
What do you think?

24:14.148 --> 24:17.804
I think humans are more
dangerous than Talkers.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.196
Or zombies.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.156
I think the Founding Fathers
would agree with you.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.853
Here, grab the wheel.

24:27.944 --> 24:29.816
That's why they created
a Bill of Rights

24:29.859 --> 24:31.470
to protect us from each other.

24:31.513 --> 24:34.603
Many tankards of ale and more
than a few bowls of hemp

24:34.647 --> 24:37.345
were consumed as Washington,
Jefferson, and Franklin

24:37.388 --> 24:39.260
hammered out the first ten
amendments to the Constitution,

24:39.303 --> 24:41.044
better known
as the Bill of Rights.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.306
Amendment number one,

24:42.350 --> 24:44.657
the right to bear arms
shall not be infringed.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.746
Do we have to start off
with guns?

24:46.789 --> 24:49.096
I mean I like a musket
as much as the next guy,

24:49.139 --> 24:52.708
but putting it first makes us
seem a little gun crazy.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.710
Yeah, okay, we'll flip
the first two.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.059
Put freedom of speech first.

24:56.103 --> 24:56.669
All right.

24:56.712 --> 24:57.583
Good.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.323
It'll look better. For the kids.

24:59.367 --> 25:00.890
Speaking of gun crazy,

25:00.934 --> 25:04.415
we need some wording in there
so nuts like that Sam Adams

25:04.459 --> 25:06.374
does not buy a blunderbust.

25:06.417 --> 25:09.029
Two beers and he's ready to
challenge his mother to a duel.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.074
Okay, we'll put in some
wording about

25:11.118 --> 25:12.728
well regulated militias

25:12.772 --> 25:15.862
so they know we don't mean
just any fool can buy a gun.

25:15.905 --> 25:18.517
Okay. All right, let's just
go down the list, right?

25:18.560 --> 25:21.607
No soldiers in your house.
No illegal search and seizures.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.956
That'll keep the lawyers busy.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.829
All right, you cannot testify
against yourself. Love that.

25:26.873 --> 25:29.528
What happens in Paris
stays in Paris, huh, Ben?

25:29.571 --> 25:30.441
Right, you know.

25:30.485 --> 25:31.921
Paris, good times.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.793
Paris, that's sick.

25:34.358 --> 25:35.359
Good times.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.057
Okay, we'll just skip past.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.625
Right to speedy trial. Right
to jury. Yadda, yadda, yadda.

25:39.929 --> 25:40.800
Number eight.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.192
No cruel or unusual punishment.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.716
Yeah, that's a tough one.

25:43.759 --> 25:46.719
Considering the whole damn
Apocalypse is cruel and unusual.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.329
Oh wait, we go down that road

25:48.372 --> 25:50.810
and it won't be too long till
we're using Franklin's kites

25:50.853 --> 25:53.073
to electrocute condemned
prisoners.

25:53.116 --> 25:54.727
Yeah, go ahead. Laugh.

25:54.770 --> 25:57.207
But one day,
electricity will power cities.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.428
Mark my word.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.912
And I'm the Easter Bunny.
Okay, Bill of Rights.

26:05.955 --> 26:10.177
Hey! Look who the cat drug in.
It's Alexander Hamilton.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.614
How's the banking business
going?

26:12.658 --> 26:14.224
Oh, great.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.357
You cats are all on a new bill.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.837
Ones, fives, twenties,
and a c-note.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.100
Which one did I make.
Am I on the hundred?

26:20.361 --> 26:21.580
Well, that's a surprise.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.452
Meanwhile, you guys get around
to abolishing slavery?

26:25.235 --> 26:25.845
Oh, we...

26:26.585 --> 26:28.108
No, we are...

26:28.151 --> 26:31.720
We are talking about that one.
And we're serious about it.

26:31.764 --> 26:32.503
And...

26:32.547 --> 26:33.243
Well excuse me, gentlemen.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.898
I sure would appreciate it
if you maybe bit the bullet

26:35.942 --> 26:37.639
and took care of this
little problem now

26:37.683 --> 26:40.076
instead of just kicking that can
on down the road.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.512
Man's got a point.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.864
Well that's a cool hat
you got there, stranger.

26:44.907 --> 26:45.995
What's your name?

26:47.649 --> 26:50.652
You didn't see me.
I wasn't here.

26:50.696 --> 26:53.568
You didn't see me.
I was never here.

26:54.177 --> 26:56.832
That dude belongs on a bill.

26:58.181 --> 26:58.965
Okay.

26:59.008 --> 27:00.227
I dunno much about history,

27:00.270 --> 27:01.881
but I know for damn sure

27:01.924 --> 27:04.797
Abe Lincoln never talked to Ben
Franklin or George Washington.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.234
You are off by like
a hundred years, man.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.628
Well, yeah.
But that's not the point.

27:09.889 --> 27:12.282
The point is they should've
dealt with slavery

27:12.326 --> 27:13.849
right from the beginning.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.155
It's a stain on America

27:15.198 --> 27:17.157
that even a Civil War
couldn't make right.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.550
You don't wanna make
that same mistake now.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.641
The only hope Dante has
for a fair trial

27:22.684 --> 27:24.947
is if they consider him
to be a human being.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.949
If they make him out to be
anything less than that,

27:26.993 --> 27:29.648
he doesn't stand a chance.
None of the Talkers do.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.565

fabulous baker boys?

27:50.581 --> 27:51.321

28:09.383 --> 28:10.689
you better be expecting
a good chomp down

28:10.732 --> 28:13.169

take out.

Help!

Switch!

Crack this one open.

33:30.791 --> 33:32.227
I'm walking here.

33:37.363 --> 33:40.105
When is everybody gonna see
that we're all in this together?

33:41.280 --> 33:43.543
Skip ahead
to the 15th Amendment.

33:43.586 --> 33:45.284
That's the one
we got to protect.

33:46.111 --> 33:49.070
The rights of the citizens
of the United States to vote

33:49.114 --> 33:52.421
shall not be denied or abridged
by the United States

33:52.465 --> 33:55.207
or by any state
on the account of race, color...

33:55.250 --> 33:57.557
Or previous condition
of servitude.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.515
Yep, that makes sense.

33:59.559 --> 34:00.690
Ya think?

34:00.734 --> 34:02.388
Yeah, well it's gonna take
a Civil War

34:02.431 --> 34:04.912
and the 13th Amendment
passing first.

34:04.955 --> 34:07.480
Let's just move everything along
and pass the 13th right now.

34:07.523 --> 34:09.134
What do you guys think?
What is it?

34:09.438 --> 34:11.005
It abolishes slavery.

34:12.180 --> 34:12.876
Oh.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.053
Like set them free abolish?

34:15.879 --> 34:19.187
This may take
some further study.

34:19.535 --> 34:21.102
No, no. No, he's right.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.712
He's right. Okay, hear me out.

34:22.756 --> 34:24.932
What if we were to take
the slaves

34:24.975 --> 34:26.934
and we were to make them
like two fifths...

34:27.152 --> 34:28.109
Make it three fifths.

34:28.153 --> 34:30.590
Three fifths of a human being.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.506
And then we just kept that going
for about 100 years

34:33.549 --> 34:35.116
until we worked out the kinks.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.031
I don't even know where to start
with you guys.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.120
You got to be kidding me.
Just shoot me.

34:39.599 --> 34:40.817
I hope we don't have to fight
a war

34:40.861 --> 34:42.384
to make the Talkers
full citizens.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.386
We may already be fighting
that war.

34:44.430 --> 34:45.953
Everybody dies.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.694
But just because
you got no pulse

34:47.737 --> 34:49.609
doesn't mean
you don't have any rights.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.569
Everybody dies.

34:53.874 --> 34:54.831
That's it.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.006
No, no, no, no, no.

34:56.050 --> 34:58.096
Everybody dies.

34:58.922 --> 35:00.489
Sooner or later,

35:00.533 --> 35:03.318
we're all Talkers.We're all Talkers.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.438
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think it's working.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.353
Them brains are doing the trick
for sure.

35:38.397 --> 35:44.272
[snarling and munching
continues]

35:44.533 --> 35:45.882
How you doing, mum?

35:46.927 --> 35:48.233
You with us?

35:50.800 --> 35:51.671
Oh my.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.370
Did I do this?

35:57.329 --> 35:59.896
Sure as shit, ma. It was yous.

36:10.603 --> 36:13.171
Mum, these Americans
come looking for help.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.349
Oh my goodness.

36:18.393 --> 36:22.049
I'm sorry you had to see me
looking all dead like this.

36:22.092 --> 36:25.313
And I wish I could've given this
place a quick lick and a promise

36:25.357 --> 36:26.575
before they showed up.

36:26.619 --> 36:27.794
That's okay.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.232
What can we do for ya's?

36:31.276 --> 36:32.842
We're looking for bizkits.

36:32.886 --> 36:35.497
The supply has been cut off,
and we have starving Talkers.

36:35.758 --> 36:38.544
They want to know
your secret recipe.

36:40.372 --> 36:41.808
There is so secret.

36:42.852 --> 36:45.507
I was lacing my bizkits
with brains

36:45.551 --> 36:46.595
for the first little while.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.815
Then we run short of brains.

36:48.858 --> 36:51.992
We started having flour
delivered from Heartland.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.908
The secret ingredient
is already mixed in.

36:54.951 --> 36:57.998
And the secret sauce is brains?
Right?

36:58.781 --> 37:04.004
Oh, no, dear.
The secret ingredient is

37:05.223 --> 37:06.354
love.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.148
I don't get it.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.628
Ah, boys.

37:20.150 --> 37:21.500
Look at you.

37:28.071 --> 37:31.379
If I can help someone else
to keep from going through

37:31.423 --> 37:32.815
what we've had to,

37:33.599 --> 37:34.861
so be it.

37:35.992 --> 37:37.820
We got enough brains right here

37:38.125 --> 37:41.650
to make up a batch
of the original recipe.

37:41.694 --> 37:43.348
Let's get shucking.

37:44.827 --> 37:45.915
I like you.

37:47.482 --> 37:49.745
Welcome back.

37:50.920 --> 37:51.878
What?

37:53.358 --> 37:54.184
They didn't get around to giving
women the right to vote

37:54.228 --> 37:56.099
until the 19th Amendment?

37:56.143 --> 37:58.363
And it didn't pass until 1920?

37:58.711 --> 38:01.235
Old white dudes. What can I say?

38:01.279 --> 38:03.019
Takes a long time
to get these things right.

38:03.063 --> 38:04.586
Well we have to it right.

38:04.630 --> 38:06.284
And we don't have a lot of time.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.416
Uh oh.
I don't like the look of this.

38:09.591 --> 38:11.289
Is that the truck they had Dante
in?

38:11.332 --> 38:12.594
I hope not.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.205
Shit.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.661
No sign of Dante.

38:36.575 --> 38:37.619
Maybe he...

38:38.533 --> 38:40.318
escaped like last time?

38:42.885 --> 38:44.931
Maybe Talkers did this,

38:45.497 --> 38:46.628
let him go?

38:55.202 --> 38:58.727
This is what happens
to traitors.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.051
I give you mercy.

40:29.339 --> 40:31.254
Mmm. I love the smell

40:31.298 --> 40:33.256
of fresh baked brains
in the morning.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.650
Well done, Mr. Murphy.

40:36.303 --> 40:38.131
You better be careful.

40:38.174 --> 40:40.612
We might just keep you on
as a full time baker.

40:40.655 --> 40:43.310
Oh. Marion.

40:43.353 --> 40:44.616
I had a great teacher.

40:45.747 --> 40:47.314
Move over boys.

40:47.357 --> 40:49.534
Hot coming through. Hot.

40:50.404 --> 40:52.319
All right, now

40:52.362 --> 40:56.105
we need to wrap them up and
stick them in here like this.

40:57.585 --> 40:58.456
Psst.

41:03.591 --> 41:06.333
Look, that family is not gonna
make it out there on their own.

41:06.376 --> 41:09.379
Why don't you take them with you
to Limbo?

41:09.423 --> 41:10.511
Yeah, sure.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.513
Limbo could use a bakery.

41:12.948 --> 41:14.254
I like that idea.

41:14.297 --> 41:15.821
I'll take Addy and 10K

41:15.864 --> 41:18.345
and go to Heartland
and figure out this flour thing

41:18.388 --> 41:21.087
and why they stopped
the distribution.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.524
Take care of them.

41:23.829 --> 41:25.483
Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.

41:25.526 --> 41:26.875
Okay, well then be safe.

41:26.919 --> 41:28.355
No, you be safe out there.

41:28.398 --> 41:30.226
I don't want to have to go
traipsing around

41:30.270 --> 41:31.837
half of Screwmerica again
to save your ass.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.187
I don't care how many times
you got to traipse around,

41:34.230 --> 41:38.017
you might have to save me.
But when you do, pick a color.

41:42.630 --> 41:43.979
I mean it, Warren.

41:45.546 --> 41:47.505
The Apocalypse wouldn't be
half as fun without you in it.

41:49.811 --> 41:50.899
Be careful.

41:54.294 --> 41:56.383
I love you too, Murphy.

41:58.733 --> 42:00.779
God, keep them safe.

42:13.922 --> 42:17.926
What do you think? Maybe
you want to say a few words?

42:22.714 --> 42:25.020
Actions speak louder than words.
