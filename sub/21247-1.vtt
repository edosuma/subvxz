20:26.217 --> 20:27.407
HAMU: Yeah.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.142
Brave like Bunga.

20:29.178 --> 20:30.686
Ready, kids?

20:30.721 --> 20:33.163
TOHETHER:<i> Zuka Zama.</i> Aah!

20:33.198 --> 20:35.107
(BLOWS LANDING AND GRUNTING)

20:35.142 --> 20:37.609
Bunga, Hamu, are you all right?

20:37.645 --> 20:38.902
Oh, hey guys.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.980
They look fine to me.

20:41.015 --> 20:43.691
But there's a lot more kids
here, than just Hamu.

20:43.726 --> 20:45.401
What happened?

20:45.436 --> 20:50.698
I guess, word spread about what an
un-Bunga-lievable babysitter I am.

20:50.733 --> 20:53.494
Kion, look what these horrible little
animals did to me and my babies.

20:54.061 --> 20:55.761
Nice!

20:55.796 --> 20:57.579
You have to save us.

20:57.615 --> 20:59.348
I think we can help you, Reirei.

20:59.383 --> 21:03.210
As long as you promise not to come
after any Pride Lands kids again.

21:04.630 --> 21:07.364
Fine. Come along, kids.

21:07.399 --> 21:09.316
I don't care to stay
where we're not welcome.

21:09.352 --> 21:10.843
Good, 'cause we don't
want you here.

21:12.963 --> 21:14.088
Can we go, Mom?

21:14.123 --> 21:16.373
Yes. Now, please?

21:16.408 --> 21:18.992
Run, kids. Run.
(JACKALS YELPING)

21:19.028 --> 21:20.853
You and the kids
did a great job, Bunga.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.129
Nothing to it.

21:22.164 --> 21:23.814
Here they are,
all our little ones.

21:27.152 --> 21:28.577
How was your day, dear?

21:28.613 --> 21:30.295
It was great!

21:30.331 --> 21:32.339
You should've seen these guys.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.541
They fought off a whole pack
of hungry jackals.

21:34.576 --> 21:36.710
ALL: (GASPING) Jackals?

21:36.746 --> 21:38.186
It was easy.

21:38.221 --> 21:40.681
We did tay-kay, roo-ka and

21:40.716 --> 21:42.074
tay-layza.

21:42.109 --> 21:45.076
Just like Bunga taught us.

21:45.112 --> 21:47.329
You taught our kids
to defend themselves?

21:47.364 --> 21:49.740
Yeah, of course.

21:49.775 --> 21:52.651
You're the best
babysitter, ever!

21:52.686 --> 21:53.927
Seriously?

21:53.963 --> 21:57.197
(CHEERING AND LAUGHING)

21:57.233 --> 21:59.600
What can I say?
I knew it all along.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.479
(CHORUS VOCALIZING)

22:27.764 --> 22:31.431

Here comes the Lion Guard ♪</i>
