00:55.934 --> 01:00.066
Hi, ma. Oh, something smells terrific.
What is it?

01:00.133 --> 01:02.266
Spaghetti sauce. Here, have a taste.

01:04.033 --> 01:05.867
Mm-mmm. Delicious.

01:05.934 --> 01:09.100
This is the reason your father married me.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.734
Girls, do you realize it's been eight days
since I've had a date?

01:13.800 --> 01:16.166
Do you realize it's been eight days
since--

01:16.233 --> 01:17.667
Ma, please!

01:18.767 --> 01:21.834
-Whatever it is, keep it to yourself.
-That's my problem.

01:24.367 --> 01:29.800
I don't understand why I don't seem
to attract as many men as I used to.

01:30.867 --> 01:33.467
Maybe it's just the beginning of the end.
Maybe...

01:33.767 --> 01:36.600
I'll never have another date in my life.

01:36.667 --> 01:42.033
-Don't be ridiculous. Not you, Blanche.
-You're right. I am being ridiculous.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.533
If anybody never has another date,
it'll probably be you.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.367
Thank you, Dorothy. I feel so much better.

01:53.734 --> 01:58.367
Hi, girls. Guess what I'm doing
every Tuesday and Thursday night?

01:58.433 --> 02:02.967
Cutting up your pantyhose
and staging an <i>Amos 'n' Andy</i> puppet show?

02:04.533 --> 02:07.166
No, but what a great idea!

02:07.900 --> 02:11.600
Now you have something to do
on Wednesdays.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.400
Okey-dokey.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.667
Do you know that promotion I was up
for at the counseling center?

02:17.734 --> 02:20.700
I can't have it
unless I become bilingual.

02:20.767 --> 02:23.567
Oh, no, honey. Don't do that.

02:23.967 --> 02:26.734
No job is worth having to date women.

02:29.066 --> 02:33.100
Bilingual refers to one who speaks
more than one language.

02:33.734 --> 02:37.400
Oh. Why did I think
it was something sexual?

02:38.700 --> 02:41.934
Anyway, I'm taking a Spanish class
at night school.

02:42.433 --> 02:46.834
That's a wonderful idea.
Men go to night school.

02:46.900 --> 02:50.467
Smart men.
Nothing turns me on more than a smart man.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.767
Unless maybe it's a stupid man
with good hands.

02:55.066 --> 02:57.734
-Rose, count me in.
-Dinner's ready.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.233
-What are we having?
-Spaghetti.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.767
Italian food?

03:00.834 --> 03:04.967
No, Rose, actually, it's Chinese food
wearing a marinara suit.

03:06.433 --> 03:08.200
-(doorbell rings)
-I'll get it.

03:09.033 --> 03:13.100
(Rose) Now that I'm taking Spanish, I'm
going to immerse myself in the culture.

03:13.166 --> 03:16.033
From now on, I'm only speaking Spanish.

03:16.367 --> 03:19.633
I'm eating Spanish food,
wearing Spanish clothes,

03:19.700 --> 03:22.867
and I'm rereading the covers
of my Julio Iglesias albums

03:22.934 --> 03:24.834
really, really carefully.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.100
Dorothy, Stan's here to see you.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.734
-Hi, everybody.
-Aw.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.066
-Oh.
-Ahh.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.700
Sorry to barge in on your meal.

03:35.767 --> 03:38.867
It's all right.
Would you like some spaghetti?

03:38.934 --> 03:40.200
-Did you make it?
-No.

03:40.266 --> 03:41.400
I'd love some.

03:43.233 --> 03:45.767
You here for a reason,
or just for free food?

03:45.834 --> 03:49.433
Ma, please. He's a guest.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.867
What the hell do you want, Stanley?

03:52.800 --> 03:57.100
The IRS found a few discrepancies
in my tax return.

03:57.166 --> 03:59.100
I think we may have a slight problem.

03:59.600 --> 04:05.400
We haven't been together for a long time.
Your tax return is your problem.

04:05.467 --> 04:09.000
Not exactly. They're reviewing my returns
for the last few years,

04:09.066 --> 04:10.800
when we were still married.

04:11.433 --> 04:14.000
Babe, I'm afraid we're being audited.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.467
-What?
-He said, "Babe--"

04:16.533 --> 04:18.100
I heard him, Rose.

04:20.834 --> 04:25.500
Relax. Sometimes they just randomly audit.
It doesn't mean there's a problem.

04:25.567 --> 04:28.233
-There's a problem.
-That's too bad. Pass the meatballs.

04:29.233 --> 04:32.133
Dorothy, I take total blame for this,

04:32.200 --> 04:35.066
but whatever happens,
we're in this together.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.233
I won't know until we actually
reconstruct our finances,

04:38.300 --> 04:41.000
but we'll probably
have to pay a small fee.

04:41.066 --> 04:43.867
-That doesn't sound bad.
-Unless we get a prison term.

04:45.166 --> 04:49.033
But don't worry.
We'll go over it tomorrow night.

04:49.100 --> 04:52.100
-Pass the parmesan.
-I will not! Now, get out!

04:52.166 --> 04:53.900
Calm down. I can eat it plain.

04:55.967 --> 04:58.867
Well, got to go. See you tomorrow night.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.800
I can't believe this is happening.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.066
Our whole married life
I was careful about money...

05:06.633 --> 05:09.433
and all the time,
Stanley had his hand in the cookie jar.

05:10.166 --> 05:14.066
The Vikings used to cut off
your hand for stealing,

05:14.133 --> 05:19.266
your tongue for lying,
and your feet for trespassing.

05:19.333 --> 05:22.333
Too bad there wasn't a Viking around
when Stanley knocked you up.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.600
<i>Buenos dias, Dorothio.</i>
That's "hello, Dorothy" in Spanish.

05:38.667 --> 05:42.166
You've really taken command
of the language.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.567
<i>Si. </i>That means "yes."

05:45.934 --> 05:48.934
If I closed my eyes,
I'd swear I was in Ecuador.

05:49.967 --> 05:51.367
Sorry. That was me.

06:02.133 --> 06:06.767
-Ok, Rose. I'm ready for class.
-You look dressed for a party.

06:06.834 --> 06:10.000
<i>Si. Mucho, mucho bazoomas.</i>

06:12.834 --> 06:15.967
-Well, <i>gracias,</i> honey.
-(doorbell rings)

06:20.934 --> 06:22.600
-Hi. It's me, Stan.
-Come in.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.967
So thoughtful of you to bring garbage.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.467
These are tax receipts.
Our future's in this bag.

06:29.533 --> 06:30.600
How appropriate.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.233
-Hi, girls.
-Hi, Stan.

06:34.734 --> 06:38.500
That blouse looks great.
Are those new? I mean...

06:41.200 --> 06:44.467
-is that new?
-Stanley, you naughty boy.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.467
When was the last time
somebody gave you a spanking?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Vegas.

06:51.767 --> 06:53.633
Come on. We'll be late.

06:53.700 --> 06:57.266
Oh, darn.
I'm not supposed to speak English.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.333
Being bilingual really gets me confused.

07:00.967 --> 07:03.700
Zip-lock bags get you confused.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.266
-See you girls later.
<i>-Adios.</i>

07:08.000 --> 07:11.066
-Sophia, you look younger than ever.
-Thank you.

07:11.133 --> 07:13.200
That's a beautiful toupee you're wearing.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.166
There. Now we're both liars.

07:17.200 --> 07:22.333
-Let's get this over with.
-Here's a copy of the tax return.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.533
We'll review each deduction individually
and document it with a receipt.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.066
What the hell is this?

07:29.500 --> 07:33.000
It's a business loss.
I made a bad investment.

07:33.066 --> 07:36.266
You never told me you were investing
our money.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.533
I actually wasn't planning to...

07:39.700 --> 07:42.734
but I knew this was a moneymaker
the minute I laid eyes on it.

07:43.333 --> 07:46.333
I'm talking tie bibs, babe.

07:48.967 --> 07:50.266
Tie bibs.

07:50.333 --> 07:53.467
Little bibs that fit over your necktie.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.934
You go out to lunch,
you don't worry about staining your tie.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.533
It's a perfect gift, a great idea.
No one else had ever thought of it.

08:03.934 --> 08:06.300
To this day, I don't
know why it didn't sell.

08:06.367 --> 08:09.066
Did you ever hear of napkins, Stanley?

08:10.967 --> 08:14.233
Hey, so I didn't make the cover
of <i>Fortune.</i>

08:15.066 --> 08:17.867
I was trying to make things better for us.

08:18.500 --> 08:22.467
All our friends were moving up.
We had a one-way ticket to <i>Palookaville</i>.

08:24.100 --> 08:27.433
I wanted to be someone.
I wanted to be a contender.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.333
Stanley, did you just rent
<i>On The Waterfront?</i>

08:36.467 --> 08:37.800
You know me so well.

08:38.600 --> 08:44.200
No, I don't.
What is this $2500 deduction for a gift?

08:52.367 --> 08:55.066
This is a receipt for the diamond ring

08:55.133 --> 08:57.900
you gave me on our 38th
wedding anniversary.

08:57.967 --> 08:58.967
I know.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.433
You spent $2500 on me?

09:03.500 --> 09:06.967
I figured after 38 years,
you deserved something major.

09:07.633 --> 09:10.100
We've had our differences,

09:10.166 --> 09:13.433
but you've always stuck by me
when it really counted.

09:13.700 --> 09:17.734
-I'll always love you for that.
-Oh, thank you, Stanley.

09:19.867 --> 09:25.433
What are all these deductions
for a Corvette and a rented garage?

09:27.633 --> 09:31.934
Dorothy, don't get mad,
and don't hit me if you do.

09:32.567 --> 09:35.166
I kind of bought a Corvette
without telling you.

09:36.900 --> 09:42.266
-You bought a car without telling me?
-I was going through a midlife crisis.

09:42.333 --> 09:46.734
So was I. I gave myself a perm
and took up jazzercise.

09:47.400 --> 09:53.200
-You bought a car without telling me?
-How can I explain it?

09:53.500 --> 09:56.667
Behind that wheel, I was noticed.
People paid attention.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.467
That car was a chick magnet.

10:01.600 --> 10:05.133
That's it, Stanley.
Get out of my house!

10:05.200 --> 10:07.700
-Get out of my life!
-What about the audit?

10:07.767 --> 10:10.033
We could wind up in jail.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.266
Good. I want you in jail.

10:12.667 --> 10:17.367
I want a big bald convict named bubba
to pick you for his girlfriend.

10:22.233 --> 10:24.433
-You don't mean that.
-The hell I don't.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.133
It's all your fault.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.734
It doesn't matter who's to blame.
The point is we're in this together.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.467
If you don't cooperate,
you'll only hurt yourself.

10:32.533 --> 10:36.200
-You're right, and I hate you for it.
-What's all the racket?

10:36.266 --> 10:40.900
Nothing. I could murder Stan.
He bought a Corvette without telling me.

10:40.967 --> 10:44.633
Your father always did things
without telling me.

10:45.033 --> 10:47.033
How do you think I got pregnant
with your brother Phil?

10:54.467 --> 10:57.166
Just remember, Dorothy,
I'll handle everything. I'm a salesman.

10:57.233 --> 10:59.233
I deal with people all the time,
I know what I'm doing.

10:59.300 --> 11:03.967
-Shut up.
-Mellow out, Dorothy.

11:04.033 --> 11:06.700
Once we get in there we have to
exercise psychological control

11:06.767 --> 11:09.300
-that's why I'm wearing this suit.
-You make me sick.

11:09.967 --> 11:12.500
Hey, everyone knows,
good guys wear white.

11:12.567 --> 11:15.233
This suit subliminally tells
the auditor I'm a good guy.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.200
I could vomit just looking at you.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.967
Mr. And Mrs. Zbornak,
step into my office.

11:23.033 --> 11:25.367
Watch me work my magic, babe.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.400
Hello. I'm Wendell Murray.
I'll be conducting your audit.

11:32.467 --> 11:35.000
Nice to meet you.
I'm Dorothy Zbornak.

11:35.066 --> 11:37.133
This is my ex-husband, Stanley.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.467
Wendell.

11:42.800 --> 11:43.800
Paisan.

11:50.166 --> 11:51.567
We're going to jail.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.967
What did you call me?

11:56.033 --> 11:58.867
Before he answers that,
let me reiterate,

11:58.934 --> 12:03.133
-we are bitterly divorced.
-Relax, Dorothy.

12:03.200 --> 12:08.500
Wendell, I called you paisan,
friend, brother of the scalp.

12:09.433 --> 12:12.400
If I may get philosophical
for just one moment,

12:12.467 --> 12:15.767
we bald men are like any other minority.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.333
That's why we have to stick together.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.233
Who you calling bald?

12:20.934 --> 12:24.734
Nobody. Nobody.
Just shut up and put your hair on.

12:26.033 --> 12:27.467
Yes, dear. Wendell...

12:27.533 --> 12:30.000
if I may call you Wendell,
did I mention the fact

12:30.066 --> 12:32.000
that I'm a member
of the rainbow coalition?

12:34.967 --> 12:39.967
Mr. Zbornak, as an employee
of the Internal Revenue Service,

12:40.033 --> 12:44.100
it's my sole obligation to see
that the government gets all its money.

12:44.166 --> 12:46.433
-You're doing a fine job.
-Thank you.

12:46.700 --> 12:50.333
I have no personal stake in this
whatsoever. Is that understood?

12:50.400 --> 12:52.400
-Yes.
-You bet.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.333
Then cut the crap, paisan.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.633
I've been at this job almost four years.

13:10.700 --> 13:14.433
In that short time,
I can honestly say that I've never seen

13:14.500 --> 13:19.834
such an inept, downright stupid attempt
to avoid paying income tax.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.767
Thanks.
That means a lot coming from you.

13:23.834 --> 13:28.834
I'm amazed. From my calculations, you only
owe the government a small amount.

13:28.900 --> 13:31.900
-You're kidding?
-No. $5000.

13:31.967 --> 13:35.433
5000? We don't have that kind of money.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.834
-Uncle Sam doesn't like to hear that.
-Aunt Dorothy doesn't enjoy saying it.

13:43.266 --> 13:46.700
You each have 30 days to cough up $2500.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.600
What if we can't?

13:48.667 --> 13:52.834
We'll put a lien on your bank accounts,
your property, and your salaries.

13:52.900 --> 13:56.166
If that doesn't work,
we'll have to incarcerate you.

13:57.700 --> 13:58.700
Oh, my God.

13:59.700 --> 14:00.867
We're going to jail!

14:04.333 --> 14:05.800
That's right, Stanley.

14:06.133 --> 14:10.700
And please, let me know where you and
bubba register for your China.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.200
Well, Rose, honey
what are you still doing up?

14:28.467 --> 14:32.467
I'm studying for my Spanish test.
Like somebody else I know should be.

14:33.033 --> 14:35.533
Don't strain yourself. Here.

14:38.934 --> 14:41.767
Blanche, these are
the answers to the test.

14:42.133 --> 14:44.700
-Where did you get these?
-I'll give you one guess.

14:45.233 --> 14:47.166
You slept with the teacher?

14:50.033 --> 14:52.967
Of course,
I didn't sleep with the teacher.

14:53.033 --> 14:55.233
You have to be very careful these days.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.734
I promised I would
if he'd gave me the answers...

15:01.166 --> 15:03.367
I call it safe teasing.

15:06.066 --> 15:07.300
Well, you can just have them back,

15:07.367 --> 15:11.300
I only cheated once in my life
and I vowed I'd never do it again.

15:11.367 --> 15:14.433
-Couldn't handle the guilt, huh?
-No, I got caught.

15:15.734 --> 15:18.166
Oh, it was the worst
experience of my whole life.

15:18.233 --> 15:20.400
St. Olaf was rocked by the scandal.

15:20.467 --> 15:23.700
What did you do, short change
somebody down at the feed store?

15:24.667 --> 15:25.867
Worse.

15:26.834 --> 15:31.834
I feed bb's to my prized lamb Harlin so
he's weigh in heavier at the county fair.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.400
Oh, my God, Rose,
how do you sleep at night?

15:37.934 --> 15:41.734
I knew it was wrong all along
but I wanted to win first prize.

15:41.800 --> 15:46.367
And I would have if Harlin could have held
it just a little longer.

15:51.734 --> 15:54.133
Boy, did you just miss a real gem.

15:55.967 --> 15:57.967
Poor, Dorothy, what are you
doing up again?

15:58.033 --> 16:00.734
I can't sleep. Everytime I close my eyes

16:00.800 --> 16:03.200
I see uncle Sam going through my purse.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.233
Still worried about the money
you owe the government?

16:06.300 --> 16:09.333
Oh, no, Blanche, I'm worried
about whether Michael Jackson

16:09.400 --> 16:12.233
will be able to buy the remains
of the elephant man.

16:16.066 --> 16:19.066
Really?
Gee, I'd be worried about the money.

16:22.567 --> 16:24.800
Doesn't anyone around here
ever go to bed?

16:24.867 --> 16:26.133
I can't sleep, ma.

16:26.433 --> 16:28.033
I can't work or eat.

16:28.433 --> 16:33.967
All I can do is think about how
I'm going to raise that $2500.

16:34.033 --> 16:38.433
-I wish I had it.
-I know. You'd give it to me.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.367
I didn't say that. I said I wish I had it.

16:44.700 --> 16:49.066
I've put away a little money, Dorothy.
It's not enough, but you're welcome to it.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.333
-Oh, Rose.
-I could lend you money

16:52.400 --> 16:56.400
I'd planned to put toward
my Bahamian cruise.

16:56.467 --> 16:58.567
Oh, thank you, girls.

16:58.633 --> 17:02.667
-I'll just buy some Belafonte tapes...
-I really appreciate it.

17:02.734 --> 17:04.700
And limbo under the clothesline.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.300
-But I can't accept.
-Okay.

17:09.400 --> 17:13.533
Oh, I only have half of the 2500.

17:13.900 --> 17:18.834
Since I don't qualify for a bank loan,
I'll just have to sell some of my stuff.

17:18.900 --> 17:19.900
Hold it.

17:20.533 --> 17:23.033
No daughter of mine is selling her stuff.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.100
It's a sin, it's a crime,
and let's face it, Dorothy,

17:28.166 --> 17:29.734
lately, you can't give it away.

17:33.066 --> 17:36.300
Ma, I'm talking about
selling some of my belongings.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.667
I called some pawnshops,
and I'll check them out tomorrow.

17:40.734 --> 17:43.100
I'm wonderful at bargaining.
I'll go with you.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.533
-Me too.
-Oh, thanks, girls.

17:46.133 --> 17:50.166
Oh, I can't believe this is happening.

17:50.233 --> 17:53.700
I was so careful about
my finances all my life.

17:53.767 --> 17:56.967
I thought that by now
I'd have some sort of security.

17:57.433 --> 17:59.533
Here I am, flat broke.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.967
I never dreamt I'd be single
and working at this age.

18:04.033 --> 18:06.133
I never dreamt I'd be this age.

18:08.233 --> 18:11.567
I'll tell you the three most
important things about life.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.600
Number one,
hold fast to your friends.

18:14.667 --> 18:18.266
Number two,
there's no such thing as security.

18:18.767 --> 18:21.767
And number three,
don't go see <i>Ishtar.</i>

18:31.033 --> 18:34.033
Now, girls, listen. Listen. Remember...

18:34.500 --> 18:38.433
the way to make a deal
is state our price, stick to our guns,

18:38.500 --> 18:40.767
and undo another button
on our blouses.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.400
Blanche, that is ridiculous.

18:43.467 --> 18:46.533
Unbuttoning my blouse
won't get us a better deal.

18:46.600 --> 18:51.000
You're right. Don't touch yours.
Rose and I will unbutton ours.

18:52.467 --> 18:55.000
<i>-Buenos dias, Senorita.</i>
-Hi.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.867
<i>Buenos dias. Como esta?</i>
(speaking Spanish)

18:59.934 --> 19:02.834
Please, don't hurt me.
Just take my money.

19:04.467 --> 19:07.633
I'm sorry.
I think I got my verbs mixed up.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.033
Thanks a lot, lady.

19:10.834 --> 19:14.033
-So what do you want?
-I'd like to pawn a few things.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.800
That's a lot of things.

19:16.333 --> 19:20.066
-How much will you give me?
-$100 for everything.

19:20.800 --> 19:25.834
Wait a minute.
Sir, I am shocked at your insensitivity.

19:25.900 --> 19:29.000
May I point out that this is
no ordinary pitcher?

19:29.066 --> 19:31.934
This pitcher was carried
thousands of miles

19:32.000 --> 19:34.934
across the ocean by her great-great
grandmother,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.333
who came to America
searching for a better life,

19:38.400 --> 19:41.467
as have millions of immigrants
throughout history.

19:41.533 --> 19:43.934
Why, this pitcher is
a symbol of freedom.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.133
This pitcher is a symbol of liberty.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.467
This pitcher was made in Taiwan.

19:51.066 --> 19:55.300
Well, maybe they stopped off
at the Ellis island gift shop.

19:56.233 --> 20:00.200
The point is,
this pitcher is worth a lot of money.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.066
That story is worth
more than the pitcher.

20:03.133 --> 20:08.500
Except for the ring you're wearing,
nothing you brought is worth anything.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.667
-How much?
-$800.

20:10.734 --> 20:13.100
-I couldn't pawn this.
-$900.

20:13.166 --> 20:16.567
-Take it, Dorothy.
-No, I couldn't.

20:17.233 --> 20:20.500
This is the only nice thing
Stan ever gave me.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.700
$1000.

20:21.767 --> 20:25.100
It's also the only valuable thing.
Hock it.

20:25.166 --> 20:28.066
-I can't.
-1200. My final offer.

20:28.133 --> 20:30.200
No. This isn't for sale.

20:30.266 --> 20:33.066
I mean, there are some things
that have no price.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.767
This means a lot to me.

20:36.266 --> 20:40.433
My husband gave it to me
after 38 years of marriage.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.266
And after 38 years of marriage,

20:43.333 --> 20:46.300
he dumped you for
a 23-year-old stewardess

20:46.367 --> 20:48.734
with firm thighs and perky breasts.

20:50.467 --> 20:54.400
You got yourself a ring, <i>muchacho.</i>
There you go.

21:02.300 --> 21:03.333
-(Blanche) Hi, Dorothy.
-Hi.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.767
I thought you two had a Spanish class.

21:06.834 --> 21:09.567
We do, but we're not going.
We dropped out.

21:09.633 --> 21:12.700
What about your promotion
at the counseling center?

21:12.767 --> 21:14.567
I can forget about that.

21:14.633 --> 21:17.600
Norwegians are
notoriously bad at Spanish.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.767
I guess that's why
there are no herring tacos.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.200
It was a big waste of my time.
There was only one cute guy there...

21:26.266 --> 21:30.333
and he kept doodling
the name "Kenny" in his notebook.

21:31.233 --> 21:32.734
(doorbell rings)

21:36.166 --> 21:39.967
-Hi, Dorothy.
-I have the check for my half.

21:40.233 --> 21:43.266
-Hi, girls.
-Hi, Stan. Where's your hair?

21:44.734 --> 21:46.700
Oh, damn.
I never should have opened that sunroof.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.133
-This just isn't my week.
-Here you go.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.533
Thanks, Dorothy. Uh, Dorothy, listen.

21:56.133 --> 22:01.333
I'm really sorry about all of this.
It's all my fault. Here.

22:03.033 --> 22:04.300
A little something for you.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.467
-My ring.
-I didn't want you to sell it.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.200
How did you know?

22:13.266 --> 22:17.633
I called. Sophia told me what happened.
I bought it back.

22:18.934 --> 22:22.200
-Stanley, you didn't have to do that.
-I wanted to do it...

22:22.867 --> 22:25.600
because in spite of everything,
you're still the best.

22:27.767 --> 22:29.166
I think I'm going to cry.

22:29.233 --> 22:30.467
No, honey. Don't do that.

22:30.533 --> 22:33.934
Your eyes will get beady, and your nose
will swell up like Karl Malden.

22:37.133 --> 22:40.834
If you bought the ring,
how did you get the rest of the money?

22:42.367 --> 22:45.300
-Sold the Corvette.
-You didn't.

22:45.367 --> 22:48.133
Yeah. I had great times with that car,

22:48.200 --> 22:51.233
but the times I had with you
were more important.

22:51.967 --> 22:53.700
Stanley, I'm so sorry.

22:53.967 --> 22:57.633
Me, too. I guess I became
what I always feared most...

22:58.000 --> 23:00.767
another middle-aged
bald guy who drives a Toyota.

23:02.333 --> 23:07.900
Oh, Stanley, this... this is the nicest
thing anyone's ever done for me.

23:09.834 --> 23:13.867
Rose, let's go down to Wally's
and see if we can meet some men.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.433
-Come on.
-Okay!

23:15.500 --> 23:18.834
If you're taking Biscayne Boulevard,
would you keep an eye out for my hair?

23:24.500 --> 23:27.934
We really pulled it out of the fire,
didn't we?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.633
We sure did.

23:29.700 --> 23:33.400
It felt nice,
you and me working as a team again.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.767
It did feel nice.

23:35.834 --> 23:37.767
It reminds me of when we were
first married.

23:37.834 --> 23:41.567
Mmm. We sure had some good times.

23:41.633 --> 23:46.700
As long as I'm here, for old times' sake,
do you want to go to bed?

23:49.700 --> 23:52.834
Dorothy, let go. It was a joke.

23:56.033 --> 23:58.066
You're hurting me.
You're really hurting me.

24:03.300 --> 24:09.300
(theme music playing)
