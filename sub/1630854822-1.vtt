[man grunting]

00:21.430 --> 00:22.688
[woman panting]

00:33.259 --> 00:34.783
[panting continues]

00:39.932 --> 00:41.206
[sighs]

00:57.224 --> 01:00.284
[dance music playing]

01:00.377 --> 01:02.227
[people chattering,
music continues]

01:03.972 --> 01:07.124
[girls chuckling]

01:07.142 --> 01:09.793
- Hey, johnny.
- Hey, how's it going?

01:09.812 --> 01:11.795
Good.
Two shots of tequila, please.

01:11.814 --> 01:13.739
Getting the night started off
with a bang, huh, kat?

01:13.966 --> 01:15.982
We're celebrating.
Kat just got promoted.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.409
- Well...
- Again?

01:17.561 --> 01:19.152
- Mm-hmm.
- Gonna be mayor

01:19.246 --> 01:20.728
Next time I see you.
Maybe then, you can help me out

01:20.823 --> 01:21.914
With all those parking tickets.

01:22.065 --> 01:24.324
Maybe.
Hey, the law's the law.

01:24.476 --> 01:26.734
But, if you promise
to take a shot with us,

01:26.754 --> 01:27.978
Maybe I could see
what I can do.

01:28.071 --> 01:29.421
Isn't that considered bribery?

01:29.648 --> 01:31.331
Mm, just some friendly
bartering.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.576
Shrewd and stunning.
That's a dangerous combination.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.261
Now, I know you'll make
a good politician.

01:36.413 --> 01:39.080
- Oh!
- Really, kat, congratulations.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.415
You deserve this.
Round's on me.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.083
To girls' night.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.586
May we all continue
to be beautiful, successful...

01:44.680 --> 01:46.680
And self-sufficient?
Mm-hmm.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.065
[glasses clinking]

01:51.445 --> 01:53.170
Evening, ladies.

01:53.263 --> 01:54.929
Sorry, I don't mean
to interrupt.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.616
- Yes, you do.
- Okay, that's fair.

01:57.843 --> 02:00.861
I was just wondering
if I could buy you a drink.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.455
- Which one?
- Sorry?

02:03.682 --> 02:05.182
Which one of us
do you wanna buy a drink?

02:05.200 --> 02:06.792
- Or will either of us do?
- [scoffs]

02:07.019 --> 02:08.610
Alex, don't be rude.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.278
I'm not being rude,
it's just a question.

02:10.372 --> 02:12.205
Somebody has to look out
for you.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.040
Don't mind my sister,
she's a littler overprotective.

02:14.193 --> 02:16.451
No, no, hey,
I can respect that.

02:16.545 --> 02:18.044
But to answer your question,

02:18.139 --> 02:20.197
I would like to buy both of you
a drink, if that's okay,

02:20.215 --> 02:22.123
And not because
I'm indiscriminate.

02:22.217 --> 02:25.310
I happen to be very particular,

02:25.462 --> 02:27.229
Especially when it comes
to women.

02:28.707 --> 02:30.482
Hey, johnny, can I have
three shots of el guzan--

02:30.634 --> 02:32.467
Actually, make it four--
one for yourself.

02:32.561 --> 02:34.486
- Wow.
- Congratulations.

02:34.713 --> 02:35.988
I couldn't help but overhear.
[glasses clinking]

02:36.139 --> 02:38.565
It's kat, right?

02:38.659 --> 02:41.142
Mm, katherine, actually.

02:41.236 --> 02:43.328
Oh, as in "the great," yes.

02:43.555 --> 02:45.071
I wouldn't want to sell
that name short either.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.748
I wouldn't let a stranger
sell it short for me.

02:48.818 --> 02:50.985
Well, my name's richard,
richard davrow,

02:51.079 --> 02:52.579
But my friends call me rick.

02:52.731 --> 02:55.323
So, I guess we're not
strangers anymore.

02:55.342 --> 02:58.402
Well, richard,
nice to meet you.

02:58.495 --> 03:00.921
But a free drink
and a formal introduction

03:01.015 --> 03:02.330
Doesn't quite make us friends.

03:02.424 --> 03:04.241
Okay.
How 'bout acquaintances?

03:04.259 --> 03:05.409
Barely.

03:05.427 --> 03:08.187
Alex!
[richard laughs]

03:08.338 --> 03:10.022
Richard: How 'bout this?
[clears throat]

03:10.173 --> 03:11.915
Your full name's
katherine leigh sloane.

03:11.934 --> 03:14.026
You graduated with honors
from dobson,

03:14.253 --> 03:17.512
And your favorite brand
of tequila is el guzan,

03:17.606 --> 03:18.363
Just like mine.

03:20.092 --> 03:21.533
Are you a detective,
mr. Davrow?

03:22.870 --> 03:23.994
I'm a doctor.

03:26.098 --> 03:27.706
Psychiatrist, actually.

03:27.857 --> 03:30.600
And is mind-reading part
of the practice these days?

03:30.694 --> 03:32.102
[chuckles]
I'm working on that.

03:32.195 --> 03:35.029
But I happen to find
that observation

03:35.123 --> 03:38.050
Is the most efficient tool,

03:38.201 --> 03:41.035
In my opinion.

03:41.129 --> 03:43.705
[scoffs]
how astute of you.

03:43.799 --> 03:46.450
Yeah, well, precision's key.

03:46.543 --> 03:48.810
Yeah, and the devil's
in the details.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.397
So, what do you think, kat?
Does this make us friends now?

03:53.901 --> 03:54.900
Maybe.

03:57.646 --> 03:58.979
Kat: What time are the movers
coming tomorrow?

03:59.073 --> 04:00.630
Noon.

04:00.724 --> 04:03.483
Don't worry,
we'll have plenty of time.

04:03.635 --> 04:05.485
I can't believe we're moving
to fairmont.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.820
Come on, don't knock it.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.638
Big fish, small pond,

04:08.657 --> 04:11.975
And you are going to be
the biggest fish, trust me.

04:11.994 --> 04:14.160
It's the next town over,
and you're from there.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.588
Yeah, don't remind me.

04:16.815 --> 04:19.407
Look, sweetheart,
I know things didn't end easily

04:19.426 --> 04:22.319
For you the last time,
but look at you now.

04:22.337 --> 04:24.096
You just got a promotion,

04:24.323 --> 04:25.989
You're one step away
from running for mayor.

04:26.082 --> 04:29.601
My wife?
My incredible wife?

04:29.753 --> 04:32.178
Well, I wouldn't be anywhere
if it weren't for you.

04:32.331 --> 04:33.588
You know, I really wish
that were true.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.348
[kat chuckles]

04:35.501 --> 04:38.110
I want you to listen
to the sound of my voice.

04:38.261 --> 04:41.187
- Mm-hmm.
- You're getting very,

04:41.340 --> 04:43.264
Very sleepy.

04:43.284 --> 04:46.118
Your husband
is the sole reason

04:46.345 --> 04:48.178
- For all your success.
- Mm-hmm.

04:48.271 --> 04:51.681
He holds the keys
to your charm,

04:51.700 --> 04:54.609
Your confidence,
and even your beauty,

04:54.628 --> 04:56.295
And he's a devil in the sack.

04:58.023 --> 04:59.798
Mm.

04:59.949 --> 05:01.115
[doorbell ringing]

05:01.209 --> 05:03.710
Mm, and that'd be the pizza.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.378
Yeah.

05:05.531 --> 05:07.597
- Okay.
- I will be right back.

05:10.218 --> 05:12.477
[phone ringing]

05:18.819 --> 05:20.802
Hello?

05:20.896 --> 05:23.304
Woman:<i> Hello, is this katherine?</i>
<i> Katherine sloane?</i>

05:23.324 --> 05:24.823
Uh, yes, this is she.

05:25.050 --> 05:27.809
<i> Katherine sloane,</i>
<i> dr. Davrow's wife?</i>

05:27.828 --> 05:30.570
Yes, that's correct.
I'm sorry, who's this?

05:30.722 --> 05:32.238
<i> Please, can you just--</i>
<i> just listen to me.</i>

05:32.333 --> 05:34.240
<i> Are you alone?</i>
<i> Can I talk to you privately?</i>

05:34.393 --> 05:36.242
Uh, yes, of course.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.502
Um...

05:39.081 --> 05:42.341
I'm alone.
I'm listening.

05:42.492 --> 05:44.009
<i> My name is sue,</i>
<i> sue taylor.</i>

05:44.236 --> 05:45.752
[door closes]
<i> and I wanna say I'm sorry,</i>

05:45.904 --> 05:47.512
<i> I'm so sorry, and I know</i>
<i> I shouldn't be</i>

05:47.739 --> 05:49.072
<i> Calling you like this,</i>
<i> but I want you to know</i>

05:49.091 --> 05:50.682
<i> That I had no idea</i>
<i> he was married,</i>

05:50.909 --> 05:52.926
<i> And I promise</i>
<i> I didn't mean to hurt anyone.</i>

05:53.078 --> 05:54.594
<i> Things got out of control,</i>
<i> and now...</i>

05:54.688 --> 05:57.171
Hang on a second.
Slow down.

05:57.265 --> 05:59.082
What are you talking about?

05:59.101 --> 06:02.102
<i> Richard and I,</i>
<i> we're seeing each other.</i>

06:02.196 --> 06:03.753
<i> We've been seeing each other</i>
<i> for a while now--</i>

06:03.772 --> 06:05.680
<i> Six months, to be exact.</i>

06:05.774 --> 06:07.440
<i> And I don't even really know</i>
<i> how it all started,</i>

06:07.593 --> 06:09.092
<i> But now I'm pregnant,</i>
<i> and I don't know</i>

06:09.111 --> 06:11.686
<i> - What I'm gonna do.</i>
- Wait a minute.

06:11.705 --> 06:15.189
You've been seeing richard
for six months?

06:15.209 --> 06:18.359
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> I'm sorry, listen.</i>

06:18.379 --> 06:20.045
<i> I had to be the one</i>
<i> to tell you this,</i>

06:20.272 --> 06:21.771
<i> And I'm sorry things got</i>
<i> to where they are now, but...</i>

06:21.790 --> 06:24.198
Hi, this is dr. Davrow.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.126
Can you please explain to me
what's going on?

06:26.220 --> 06:28.628
All right, listen to me.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.948
Look, you're gonna be okay.
No one is trying to hurt you.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.041
Have you been
taking your medication?

06:34.136 --> 06:36.136
Good.
Have you taken it today?

06:36.230 --> 06:38.379
All right, listen to me.

06:38.473 --> 06:40.565
I am no longer your doctor.

06:40.792 --> 06:43.293
I want to help you,
but what I need you to do

06:43.386 --> 06:45.570
Is call your current physician

06:45.722 --> 06:47.406
And let them know
what's going on.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.241
And I need you to never
call this number again.

06:49.468 --> 06:51.243
Do you understand?
You're going to be all right.

06:51.470 --> 06:53.153
Good night.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.804
I am so sorry.

06:54.823 --> 06:56.581
I have no idea
how she got your number.

06:56.733 --> 06:57.974
Who was that?

06:58.067 --> 07:00.585
That was a former patient
of mine.

07:00.812 --> 07:02.996
She suffers from
schizo-obsessive disorder.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.649
What is that, exactly?

07:05.742 --> 07:07.592
I mean, the girl sounded
pretty desperate.

07:07.819 --> 07:10.912
She sounded like
she was telling the truth.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.324
Yeah, she absolutely
is telling the truth,

07:14.417 --> 07:16.268
As far as her brain
can recognize.

07:17.754 --> 07:19.438
Sue taylor isn't pregnant.

07:19.665 --> 07:21.681
She was my patient
up until three weeks ago,

07:21.775 --> 07:24.668
When her ocd took a turn
and was directed towards me.

07:24.761 --> 07:27.003
She started showing up
to my office unannounced,

07:27.096 --> 07:28.947
Was waiting for me
in the parking lot.

07:29.098 --> 07:33.510
She was convinced that
we are meant to be together.

07:33.603 --> 07:35.436
Once that type of delusion
sets in,

07:35.530 --> 07:39.032
It's really hard to get rid of,

07:39.184 --> 07:41.084
Even if the psychosis itself
is treated.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.689
Eventually,
I had to call the police

07:45.782 --> 07:48.024
When she was breaking
into my office.

07:48.043 --> 07:49.634
What?
Richard, why--

07:49.786 --> 07:51.044
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.471
Why did you not tell me?

07:52.698 --> 07:53.805
Honey...

07:55.367 --> 07:57.309
[sighs]

07:57.536 --> 07:59.869
This is why I don't wanna
discuss my work with you.

07:59.963 --> 08:01.871
I don't want you
to worry about me.

08:01.965 --> 08:03.556
Look, I was never in
any real danger,

08:03.709 --> 08:04.983
And she's not a threat.

08:07.045 --> 08:09.713
Listen, I know how jealous
you get sometimes.

08:09.806 --> 08:12.324
Oh, please, stop it,
I'm not jealous.

08:12.475 --> 08:13.975
Oh, yeah?
What would you call this then?

08:14.069 --> 08:16.161
Richard, a woman just called me

08:16.388 --> 08:18.905
Saying that she's been
dating you for months

08:19.057 --> 08:20.499
And she's pregnant
with your child.

08:20.650 --> 08:22.242
How would you
expect me to react?

08:22.394 --> 08:24.151
With trust.

08:24.246 --> 08:26.296
Honey, she's ill.

08:29.084 --> 08:31.009
Look, if you want me to call my
receptionist right now, I will.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.418
She's been dealing
with this situation all day

08:32.513 --> 08:33.678
And she can fill you in.

08:33.830 --> 08:34.846
No, stop, you don't have
to do that.

08:34.998 --> 08:36.589
No, no, no,
I'll call her right now.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.183
Come on, I can't believe you.

08:38.410 --> 08:39.409
Is there somebody else
you want me to call?

08:39.427 --> 08:40.744
- No.
- No?

08:40.837 --> 08:41.836
- You sure?
- Yes, I trust you.

08:41.855 --> 08:42.854
Okay.

08:43.006 --> 08:44.356
[kat chuckles]

08:47.528 --> 08:48.777
It was just scary.

08:50.605 --> 08:52.030
- I love you.
- I love you.

08:55.443 --> 08:56.760
Kat: That's the last of it.

08:56.853 --> 08:58.703
Thanks so much again
for helping out.

08:58.930 --> 09:00.372
You sure you don't
wanna stay for dinner?

09:00.599 --> 09:02.115
Yeah, come on, alex,
we'd love to have you.

09:02.267 --> 09:03.767
I'm making my world-famous
lasagna.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.044
Thanks,
but I gotta get going.

09:06.195 --> 09:08.121
But kat, call me sometime.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.956
Maybe we can have
a sister spa day or something.

09:10.108 --> 09:10.882
Absolutely.

09:13.795 --> 09:14.803
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.116
Everything okay?
Sleep all right last night?

09:20.209 --> 09:22.727
Oh, yeah.
I got a few hours.

09:22.879 --> 09:24.229
You know, with everything
that's going on.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.074
Thanks again.

10:04.087 --> 10:05.437
[knocking]

10:08.942 --> 10:10.350
Richard: I got it.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.760
Okay.
[door opens]

10:12.854 --> 10:14.261
Woman: Hey there, good morning.

10:14.356 --> 10:16.022
Richard: Uh, good afternoon.

10:16.174 --> 10:17.949
Woman: I am welcoming you
to the neighborhood.

10:18.101 --> 10:19.692
I'm vivienne,
I live right next door.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.937
Hi, I'm kat,
and this is my husband, richard.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.939
I tell you what,
this neighborhood

10:24.958 --> 10:27.125
Keeps getting better looking
by the second.

10:27.276 --> 10:28.534
Where'd you two move from?

10:28.629 --> 10:30.444
Ardendale.

10:30.538 --> 10:32.130
Oh, just the next town over.

10:32.357 --> 10:33.447
What brings you
to our neck of the woods?

10:33.467 --> 10:36.209
A new job--
city manager.

10:36.361 --> 10:38.027
Oh, congratulations.

10:38.046 --> 10:39.453
No, no, not it.

10:39.547 --> 10:41.714
Oh, geez, two minutes in,

10:41.808 --> 10:43.290
And I'm already sticking
my foot in my mouth.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.310
I should have known.
Kat, congratulations.

10:45.461 --> 10:47.203
You've got boss
written all over you.

10:47.222 --> 10:48.872
I might say the same thing
about you.

10:48.890 --> 10:50.390
[chuckles]
I know, right?

10:50.542 --> 10:52.208
Really, though,
who needs a man

10:52.227 --> 10:54.894
When women are literally
taking over the world.

10:55.046 --> 10:57.230
- No offense, richard.
- Oh, hey, none taken.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.641
Honestly, I left my husband
about four years ago.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.887
Best decision of my life.
Again, no offense.

11:03.905 --> 11:05.738
Hey, hey, pretend like
I'm not even here.

11:05.891 --> 11:07.240
Too late.

11:07.392 --> 11:10.001
Listen, the only thing
I miss about a man

11:10.228 --> 11:12.319
Is having someone
to fix things around the house.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.340
Well, in that case,
you can have richard.

11:15.491 --> 11:16.900
He's all yours
anytime you like.

11:16.918 --> 11:20.661
Ooh, a husband on loan.
You really are a girl boss.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.013
- Well...
- Tell me,

11:22.165 --> 11:23.998
Is he good with his hands?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.351
Well, he is a little bit
of a klutz.

11:26.578 --> 11:27.852
Okay, I actually am
standing right here though.

11:28.004 --> 11:30.079
[kat chuckles]

11:30.098 --> 11:32.357
Hm.
I see what you mean.

11:32.508 --> 11:35.084
Skin's a bit soft
to do any real damage.

11:35.178 --> 11:35.985
Might have to toughen him up
a bit.

11:38.181 --> 11:39.939
Oh, don't look so scared,
richard, I won't bite,

11:40.033 --> 11:41.515
Unless you ask me to.

11:41.609 --> 11:42.992
Nice meeting you, vivienne.

11:45.188 --> 11:47.188
Kat: Well, I liked her.
I thought she was funny.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.115
Funny?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.951
Yeah, that's an interesting way
to describe her.

11:52.103 --> 11:53.786
Oh, stop it.
Come on, I know you did too.

11:53.880 --> 11:54.838
With those legs?

11:56.458 --> 11:57.623
Besides, I just think
it would be good

11:57.776 --> 11:58.717
To have another friend
in town, you know?

12:00.462 --> 12:02.178
Oh, babe, what are these?

12:04.783 --> 12:06.616
Oh, I've been looking
for those.

12:06.709 --> 12:08.375
One of my reps
gave 'em to me.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.803
- They just hit the market.
- Oh, what are they for?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.956
They're for when my patients
have sleeping problems.

12:12.974 --> 12:14.958
Apparently,
they're very effective.

12:14.976 --> 12:18.403
In fact... They could
be good for you.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.408
Are you allowed to do that,
prescribe pills to your wife?

12:27.063 --> 12:28.538
[whispering]
I won't tell if you won't.

12:30.141 --> 12:31.732
I'll hang onto 'em.

12:31.826 --> 12:33.835
Just in case.
[pills rattling]

12:35.905 --> 12:38.481
I know, yes.
And I would love to...

12:38.574 --> 12:39.983
Katherine?

12:40.001 --> 12:41.742
Oh, miriam, hi.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.503
I heard you were back in town.

12:43.655 --> 12:45.764
- How long's it been?
- A while.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.492
Since just after prom.

12:49.585 --> 12:51.844
Pardon the interruption.
I'm miriam.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.272
Katherine and I were
old high school classmates

12:54.423 --> 12:55.923
Before she just up
and disappeared

12:55.942 --> 12:57.500
- Without a trace.
- [sighs]

12:57.593 --> 13:00.261
No goodbye,
no forwarding address.

13:00.355 --> 13:02.447
She just fell off the grid.

13:02.674 --> 13:05.116
- I thought it was time to go.
- I get that.

13:05.268 --> 13:06.934
I mean, I can't imagine with
what happened here and all

13:06.953 --> 13:08.620
Could be good for you,

13:08.771 --> 13:11.697
What with your budding
political career and all.

13:11.792 --> 13:15.627
But hey, the past is the past,
and now you're back.

13:15.778 --> 13:17.086
And I have no doubt you'll make
your mark here again.

13:18.373 --> 13:19.631
Nice to meet you.

13:21.543 --> 13:23.802
- Old friend?
- Not really.

13:26.714 --> 13:28.973
[panting]

13:33.129 --> 13:35.555
[cork popping]

13:35.707 --> 13:38.224
- Oh.
- Ooh, true crime.

13:38.376 --> 13:39.876
Well, you can forget
going to bed early.

13:39.969 --> 13:41.227
You're gonna be up all night.

13:41.379 --> 13:42.821
I'm just doing
a little research.

13:43.048 --> 13:46.140
Oh yeah?
Devising a plan for my murder?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.827
I promise I'll make it painless.

13:48.978 --> 13:51.237
Hey, don't forget
to cover your tracks.

13:51.389 --> 13:53.147
[gasps]
ooh, well, don't forget

13:53.241 --> 13:54.815
To be good to me.

13:54.909 --> 13:56.559
You off for boys night out?

13:56.578 --> 13:58.652
Yeah.
Shouldn't be late,

13:58.672 --> 14:01.322
Just a drink with some
old friends.

14:01.416 --> 14:02.966
Okay, I won't wait up, then.

14:05.494 --> 14:06.928
Hey, babe?

14:08.239 --> 14:10.181
Can I borrow your car?
Mine's out of gas.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.076
<i> Mi carro</i>
<i> es tu carro,</i> right?

14:13.094 --> 14:14.594
I love it when you talk
dirty to me.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.412
[chuckles]
have fun.

14:16.431 --> 14:18.523
[door opens and closes]

14:23.771 --> 14:25.864
<i> This is richard davrow.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

14:26.091 --> 14:27.773
You know, how am I supposed
to plan your murder

14:27.868 --> 14:29.492
If I don't know
what time you're getting home?

14:31.596 --> 14:34.021
I hope you're having fun.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.790
All right, see you soon.

14:37.102 --> 14:38.126
Love you.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.860
[glass breaking]

15:17.976 --> 15:19.733
[cat mewing]

15:19.753 --> 15:21.544
[light tapping,
kat gasps]

16:02.520 --> 16:03.962
[sighs]

16:07.542 --> 16:09.717
[dog barking in distance]

16:17.960 --> 16:19.227
[knocking]

16:22.707 --> 16:23.439
[distorted voice]
kat?

16:27.212 --> 16:28.044
[distorted voice]
kat?

16:28.137 --> 16:30.379
[knocking]

16:30.398 --> 16:31.614
[sighs]

16:34.385 --> 16:35.159
[knocking continues]

16:39.557 --> 16:40.999
[knocking continues]

16:45.230 --> 16:46.295
Richard?

16:48.842 --> 16:50.675
[knocking]
coming.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.328
Vivienne: Morning, sunshine.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.573
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I wake you?

16:57.666 --> 16:59.575
I kind of pegged you
as an early riser.

16:59.594 --> 17:01.668
I am, I mean...

17:01.763 --> 17:03.670
I was just waking up now.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.415
Late night.
Hey, I get it.

17:06.509 --> 17:08.359
New place, gotta christen
the house.

17:08.511 --> 17:10.177
[chuckles]

17:10.196 --> 17:11.678
Well, tell that stud
of a husband of yours

17:11.698 --> 17:14.590
It's time to get up
and do some real work.

17:14.609 --> 17:16.259
A man's gotta be good
for something.

17:16.277 --> 17:17.684
But in all seriousness,

17:17.704 --> 17:19.262
I could actually use
his help this morning.

17:19.355 --> 17:21.539
My kitchen sink
is clogged again.

17:21.766 --> 17:23.357
[sighs]
I suppose that's what I get

17:23.376 --> 17:24.934
For having 40-year-old pipes,

17:25.027 --> 17:26.693
And I'm not talking
about myself.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.939
Actually, vivienne,
richard's not here right now.

17:29.957 --> 17:31.941
He's not?

17:31.959 --> 17:33.200
Don't tell me
he's the early riser?

17:33.219 --> 17:35.628
He is, normally.

17:35.780 --> 17:37.305
But I don't even think
he came home last night.

17:39.133 --> 17:40.707
He went out for drinks
with friends,

17:40.727 --> 17:42.876
And I still haven't
heard from him, so...

17:42.970 --> 17:45.638
Oh, no.
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.306
But I wouldn't worry,
I really wouldn't.

17:47.458 --> 17:48.733
I'm sure he's fine.

17:48.884 --> 17:51.718
You know, maybe he just
got caught up.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.071
Maybe he had a little bit
too much to drink,

17:53.222 --> 17:54.655
A little bit too much fun.

17:57.135 --> 17:58.493
You know how it is.

18:01.063 --> 18:03.748
Uh, you're right.
It's probably nothing.

18:03.975 --> 18:06.142
Okay, thanks, vivienne,
I will let richard know

18:06.235 --> 18:07.418
You stopped by
when I see him.

18:07.570 --> 18:08.586
Thank you.

18:10.481 --> 18:11.506
[sighs]

18:21.509 --> 18:23.226
[sighs]

18:25.680 --> 18:26.729
Man: Good morning, miss sloane.

18:28.257 --> 18:29.607
- Welcome to city hall.
- Ah.

18:29.758 --> 18:32.835
Kat, please.
[chuckles]

18:32.854 --> 18:34.837
You must be phil.

18:34.856 --> 18:36.339
I've been really looking forward
to meeting you.

18:36.432 --> 18:37.690
We're all hoping
for big things.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.283
Thank you.

18:39.510 --> 18:42.120
Well, it's as grand
as I remember it.

18:42.347 --> 18:44.104
Yeah, benefits of sharing
with the state.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.456
Well, let me show you
to your office,

18:45.608 --> 18:47.199
And then I-- oh.
[phone ringing]

18:47.352 --> 18:50.703
- Uh... One second.
- Please.

18:50.855 --> 18:53.965
Richard, jesus, where are you?
Been worried sick.

18:54.192 --> 18:55.782
<i> Hey, babe,</i>
<i> I'm just checking in.</i>

18:55.877 --> 18:57.301
How's your morning?

18:57.453 --> 19:00.363
I was out the door early,
I had to run some errands.

19:00.381 --> 19:02.047
<i> What are you talking about?</i>
<i>You didn't come home last night.</i>

19:02.200 --> 19:03.141
I tried calling you.

19:04.869 --> 19:08.037
Sweetheart, I came home
last night.

19:08.130 --> 19:09.372
Don't you remember,
you woke up

19:09.465 --> 19:11.649
And you asked me
what time it was?

19:11.876 --> 19:13.818
- Uh...
- You remember that, right?

19:16.214 --> 19:17.822
No, I...

19:18.992 --> 19:20.807
Uh...

19:20.827 --> 19:23.161
I gotta go.
I'll call you back later.

19:24.813 --> 19:27.890
- Marcos rivera.
- Wow, kat sloane.

19:27.909 --> 19:29.575
I heard you were starting
here today,

19:29.727 --> 19:30.835
But I still can't believe it.

19:30.986 --> 19:32.986
I know.
I know, since I left town.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.339
A week after prom.

19:35.491 --> 19:37.066
Was I really that bad
of a date?

19:37.159 --> 19:39.677
- [sighs]
- I'm sorry, I'm just teasing.

19:39.828 --> 19:42.238
I know things
got a little...

19:42.256 --> 19:43.848
Rough for you near the end.

19:43.999 --> 19:46.592
Well, I was kinda hoping
everyone forgot about that.

19:46.744 --> 19:48.502
Oh, it was just a rumor, kat.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.095
Completely unfounded,
everyone knew that.

19:50.248 --> 19:51.522
Yeah, well, did miriam?

19:51.674 --> 19:55.601
Well, miriam's a tough nut
to crack.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.362
And you know,
she was the victim in all of it.

19:58.514 --> 20:00.847
- She wasn't the only one.
- I know.

20:00.942 --> 20:02.775
But, you know her.

20:02.927 --> 20:05.110
You know how she likes
to stir up the drama.

20:05.263 --> 20:06.762
She's even made a career
out of it, you know?

20:06.781 --> 20:08.188
She reports
for the fairmont gazette.

20:08.282 --> 20:09.707
Oh.
Sounds fitting,

20:09.858 --> 20:11.358
Considering her talent
for meddling

20:11.377 --> 20:12.785
In other people's business,
right?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.378
[both chuckle]

20:14.605 --> 20:16.439
Oh.

20:16.532 --> 20:18.532
- Oh, I'm holding you up.
- Sorry.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.292
First day, need to make
a good impression.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.344
Of course.

20:25.116 --> 20:28.117
You know, I tried
looking you up a few times.

20:28.135 --> 20:29.635
You changed your number,
went off social media.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.395
Oh, yeah.

20:31.622 --> 20:33.231
I should have called
or reached out.

20:33.382 --> 20:35.791
- I just...
- Wanted your privacy?

20:35.810 --> 20:37.401
It's okay.
I know you, kat.

20:37.553 --> 20:39.128
[chuckles]
no apologies, right?

20:39.146 --> 20:41.146
Besides, if you hadn't left,

20:41.299 --> 20:42.723
Then I wouldn't have been able
to experience

20:42.742 --> 20:44.984
The amazing bachelor lifestyle

20:45.078 --> 20:47.303
That fairmont has so generously
afforded me.

20:47.321 --> 20:50.063
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah, I don't wanna brag,

20:50.083 --> 20:52.141
But it's been quite exceptional.

20:52.234 --> 20:55.253
And, sorry, you--
what about you?

20:55.404 --> 20:58.256
I mean, city manager.

20:58.483 --> 20:59.815
I always knew
you were out of my league.

20:59.908 --> 21:01.333
Oh, come on,
that's not true.

21:01.486 --> 21:04.077
Well, maybe not, but...

21:04.097 --> 21:06.489
Anyway, looks like
I missed my chance.

21:06.582 --> 21:08.582
Congratulations.
Lucky man.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.917
Thank you, and good eye.

21:11.012 --> 21:12.603
Ah, you know what they say,
you have to have two of them

21:12.755 --> 21:15.439
- To be a detective, so...
- A detective, huh?

21:15.591 --> 21:17.066
I had to put my nosiness
to good use.

21:18.669 --> 21:19.944
And speaking of which,
I'm not done

21:20.095 --> 21:21.279
With my investigation.

21:23.265 --> 21:26.191
Married.
Who's the lucky man?

21:26.344 --> 21:28.360
- His name is richard.
- Richard.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.012
Sounds fancy.

21:30.031 --> 21:32.348
- [sighs]
- I'm willing to bet

21:32.441 --> 21:34.250
You're out of his league too.

21:35.778 --> 21:37.703
Nice to see you again, marcos.

21:37.855 --> 21:40.631
[door opens and closes]

21:43.528 --> 21:45.544
Hey, stranger.
Just getting home?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.120
Um, yeah.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.623
Actually, I was just out
doing some errands.

21:49.717 --> 21:51.458
You're a terrible liar.

21:51.477 --> 21:54.386
You know, you should be
more careful.

21:54.539 --> 21:56.539
Your wife was up
waiting for you all night.

21:56.557 --> 21:57.723
I think she may be onto you.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.224
[laughing]

21:59.319 --> 22:01.485
Oh!
What happened?

22:01.637 --> 22:04.046
It's nothing.
Um, it's just, uh,

22:04.065 --> 22:07.116
She... Gets upset sometimes.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.387
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, it's fine.

22:11.480 --> 22:14.056
Honestly, I am a bit of a klutz.

22:14.075 --> 22:15.407
[chuckles]

22:15.560 --> 22:18.151
Um, when did you see her?

22:18.171 --> 22:20.579
This morning.
I stopped by to check in

22:20.673 --> 22:23.732
And take her up on that
husband-on-loan offer.

22:23.751 --> 22:25.659
My kitchen sink is clogged.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.303
Looks like I could use a man
after all.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.331
Well, yeah, guess maybe I could
come over and have a look.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.017
You know,
I actually happen to excel

22:33.244 --> 22:35.853
In poking around places
I don't belong.

22:36.004 --> 22:37.337
- Just ask my clients.
- [laughing]

22:37.431 --> 22:38.689
Well, if that's the case,

22:38.916 --> 22:41.266
My sink has years
of trauma to unpack.

22:41.419 --> 22:43.769
Let me just change
my clothes real quick,

22:43.921 --> 22:46.346
And come on over,
have a look.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.865
I'll be waiting with bells on.

22:54.874 --> 22:55.706
[door closes]

22:58.378 --> 23:00.861
Hey!
There she is.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.955
Jesus, you scared me.
I didn't know you were home.

23:03.107 --> 23:04.215
I've been home all day.

23:07.035 --> 23:08.511
[sniffing]

23:10.448 --> 23:12.390
Ah, honey,
that smells delicious.

23:12.541 --> 23:15.226
- Is that...
- Only your favorite.

23:15.453 --> 23:17.620
- Lamb tagine.
- Mm, I knew I married you

23:17.638 --> 23:19.397
- For a reason.
- Mm-hmm.

23:19.548 --> 23:23.717
So, your big first day.
Tell me all about it.

23:23.811 --> 23:27.071
It was-- it was good, actually.

23:27.222 --> 23:30.315
Really good.
But I was just so tired.

23:30.468 --> 23:32.225
Yeah, well, I can believe that.

23:32.319 --> 23:34.637
You were pretty knocked out
when I got home last night.

23:34.655 --> 23:37.915
Well, I was up a little later
than I would have liked.

23:38.066 --> 23:40.159
Well, I can't say
I didn't warn you

23:40.311 --> 23:42.161
About those true crime novels.

23:42.313 --> 23:46.649
Um, yeah, so exactly
what happened last night?

23:46.667 --> 23:48.408
I tried texting and calling.

23:48.502 --> 23:52.763
I know.
Babe, I'm so sorry.

23:52.915 --> 23:55.174
We ended up in ardendale,
I lost track of time.

23:55.326 --> 23:57.493
And it got late,
and then I look at my phone.

23:57.511 --> 23:58.394
It's dead.

24:00.014 --> 24:02.440
Oh.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.516
Well, I was really worried
about you.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.335
I had a hell of a time
trying to get to sleep.

24:06.353 --> 24:09.113
Babe, I am so sorry.
Really.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.526
Did you end up taking one of
those sleeping pills last night?

24:14.679 --> 24:16.078
Yeah, and it completely
knocked me out.

24:17.531 --> 24:19.031
I don't remember anything.

24:19.183 --> 24:21.183
Not even you getting home,
I guess.

24:21.202 --> 24:22.518
I really should have
warned you about those.

24:22.536 --> 24:25.629
They can be...
Really powerful.

24:27.525 --> 24:31.694
They can cause vivid dreams,
hallucinations.

24:31.712 --> 24:33.304
People sleepwalk.

24:33.455 --> 24:35.288
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.807
People have been going
to bed at night,

24:36.959 --> 24:38.309
And then they wake up
in the morning and they have

24:38.460 --> 24:40.811
No recollection of what happened
the night before.

24:40.963 --> 24:44.707
So, I guess
I can't really blame you

24:44.800 --> 24:46.984
For taking that swing
at me last night.

24:48.896 --> 24:50.321
What are you talking about?

24:56.887 --> 25:00.222
Uh... You're messing with me.

25:00.315 --> 25:01.890
- I didn't do that.
- [chuckles]

25:01.909 --> 25:03.650
No, you did that.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.152
I guess I startled you
a little bit.

25:06.172 --> 25:09.155
[sighs]
I don't remember that at all.

25:09.175 --> 25:12.343
Hey, no, like I said,
I should have warned you, okay?

25:13.921 --> 25:16.514
Just remember, you have to be
careful with those pills.

25:16.665 --> 25:18.832
I was-- I was trying
to get to sleep.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.909
I had a big day in the morning.
You should have called me.

25:21.003 --> 25:23.670
Hey, I said I was sorry, okay?
And I am.

25:23.689 --> 25:24.813
Okay?

25:26.751 --> 25:29.268
Honey, I know
you've been stressed

25:29.420 --> 25:31.270
With work and the move,

25:31.422 --> 25:33.013
And you've been
having problems sleeping.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.758
I've been sleeping fine.

25:35.851 --> 25:38.443
And I know
I should have called.

25:38.596 --> 25:41.705
It won't happen again.
I promise.

25:44.769 --> 25:47.545
And if it does,
I give you full authority

25:47.772 --> 25:49.213
To sic your dogs after me
and hunt me down.

25:50.866 --> 25:52.291
We don't own any dogs.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.200
Well, I'm sure you could pull
a couple hounds

25:54.220 --> 25:55.052
Out of your back pocket.

25:56.538 --> 25:57.721
You better believe it.

26:13.573 --> 26:14.738
Babe?

26:27.086 --> 26:28.544
[scoffs]

26:39.506 --> 26:40.764
[sighs]

26:52.853 --> 26:53.944
[light switch
clicking off]

27:01.028 --> 27:04.270
Mm, babe, where were you?
Did you go somewhere?

27:04.365 --> 27:05.605
Mm-mm.
I'm right here.

27:05.699 --> 27:06.790
[richard groaning]

27:13.615 --> 27:14.873
[door opens]
woman: Morning, kat.

27:16.193 --> 27:17.635
I know it's your first week,
but I've got a hell of a day,

27:17.786 --> 27:19.194
So I'll get right to it.

27:19.213 --> 27:21.029
The city is way over budget.

27:21.123 --> 27:22.640
We need to start
making cuts.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.960
What do you got?

27:26.979 --> 27:29.388
Thank you.
Actually, I do have an idea.

27:29.482 --> 27:30.481
Fire away.

27:32.300 --> 27:33.984
Drug prevention programs,
is it true

27:34.136 --> 27:35.711
We're defunding
those initiatives?

27:35.729 --> 27:37.821
It's complicated.

27:37.973 --> 27:40.065
In previous years
grants have helped

27:40.159 --> 27:43.902
To subsidize these programs,
but they haven't been renewed.

27:44.054 --> 27:47.313
So, we're cutting back on
drug prevention programs,

27:47.333 --> 27:49.241
But we're spending
three times that amount

27:49.393 --> 27:52.895
- On a drug called narcan?
- Narcan saves lives.

27:52.913 --> 27:54.487
It's the only antidote
on the market

27:54.581 --> 27:56.990
That reverses
drug overdose.

27:57.084 --> 27:59.251
First responders need it.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.012
With the national drug crisis
even in our town,

28:02.164 --> 28:03.922
We can't take that risk.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.351
Well, I'm not proposing
we eliminate it altogether.

28:09.413 --> 28:12.338
But we don't have
the same problems

28:12.358 --> 28:14.266
As the bigger cities.

28:14.418 --> 28:16.601
That may be, but we still
need to be prepared

28:16.754 --> 28:18.028
In the event of an emergency.

28:18.180 --> 28:20.864
Look, I'm not saying
that fairmont

28:21.091 --> 28:24.017
Doesn't have
a drug addiction problem.

28:24.111 --> 28:26.704
But I am saying that,
thankfully, drug-related deaths

28:26.855 --> 28:27.996
Aren't as big of an issue.

28:30.525 --> 28:31.950
So, what do you propose?

28:32.102 --> 28:34.937
Drug prevention
saves more lives,

28:34.955 --> 28:37.548
And education is paramount,

28:37.699 --> 28:39.107
Especially with most
of the victims

28:39.201 --> 28:40.609
Being teens and young adults.

28:40.702 --> 28:43.178
Trust me,
I speak from experience.

28:47.893 --> 28:51.303
Well, I brought you in
for fresh thinking,

28:51.455 --> 28:52.896
So I guess I should
let you run with it.

28:56.627 --> 28:59.069
I have another meeting.

28:59.221 --> 29:00.738
Turns out the city
won't run itself.

29:03.058 --> 29:05.033
- It's your baby now.
- Thank you.

29:12.159 --> 29:14.234
[sighs, chuckles]

29:14.328 --> 29:16.587
What did that mean?

29:16.738 --> 29:18.163
Means she knows
I'm after her job.

29:18.315 --> 29:19.423
So, we better not mess this up.

29:19.574 --> 29:22.818
Well, she's not wrong.

29:22.836 --> 29:25.245
It'll make a great platform for
your campaign next year though.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.006
Thank you, you know,
I'm pretty passionate about it.

29:28.158 --> 29:29.491
Even better.

29:29.510 --> 29:30.842
Voters love personal stories,
right?

29:30.995 --> 29:32.677
Yes, but let's keep the focus

29:32.830 --> 29:34.846
On what it'll do
for the community.

29:34.999 --> 29:36.515
100%.

29:36.667 --> 29:38.108
Either way,
your constituents will love it.

29:38.260 --> 29:40.093
It's a big win, kat.
Congratulations.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.278
Thank you.
I think so too.

29:43.357 --> 29:45.098
Vivienne: Back so soon?

29:45.192 --> 29:47.433
Richard: Yeah, I think I left
my wrench here the other day.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.511
- Mind if I look around?
- Oh, not at all.

29:49.604 --> 29:51.196
I'm actually glad
you came back.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.181
My drain has still been
acting a bit finicky.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.792
Oh yeah?
Well, maybe I can have a look.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.629
Oh, there it is.

30:04.452 --> 30:05.469
[phone beeps]

30:08.474 --> 30:11.049
[phone buzzing]
richard: Goodness.

30:11.201 --> 30:13.644
Talk about trauma.
What have you done to this sink?

30:13.871 --> 30:15.053
It clearly needs years
of therapy.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.555
[laughing]

30:16.707 --> 30:18.315
[loud whirring]
oh, hot! Ah!

30:18.466 --> 30:19.708
[phone continues buzzing]
I'm telling you, this sink

30:19.801 --> 30:21.485
- Has a mind of its own.
- Clearly.

30:21.712 --> 30:23.654
- Let me grab you a towel.
- [sighs]

30:23.805 --> 30:25.881
You know, I would say I'm sorry,
but you probably deserve it.

30:25.899 --> 30:28.325
That's all right, I didn't like
this shirt anyways.

30:28.476 --> 30:30.902
Mind if I stick around
for a sec?

30:31.055 --> 30:32.996
Throw my shirt in the dryer?

30:33.223 --> 30:34.723
I'm sure I've got
a t-shirt you can borrow.

30:34.741 --> 30:36.333
[phone ringing]
just...

30:39.246 --> 30:41.004
Hello?
Yes, this is she.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.567
What?

30:45.586 --> 30:46.802
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

30:49.089 --> 30:51.089
That's impossible.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.592
No.
No! No!

30:53.686 --> 30:56.019
[sobbing]

30:59.099 --> 31:00.932
I'll have them change that.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.027
- Hey, kat.
- Hi.

31:04.254 --> 31:08.198
I want to thank you again
for hearing me out today.

31:08.425 --> 31:11.201
This issue really means
a lot to me.

31:11.353 --> 31:12.928
Of course.

31:12.946 --> 31:15.855
Listen, I'm not sure
if you've heard yet,

31:15.875 --> 31:19.192
But a young woman was found
dead in her home this morning.

31:19.286 --> 31:21.786
- Overdose.
- What?

31:21.939 --> 31:23.622
Oh, no.

31:23.774 --> 31:26.341
Um, no, I didn't hear that.

31:28.946 --> 31:31.680
Well, just wanting
to keep you in the loop.

31:33.041 --> 31:33.891
Thank you.

31:39.473 --> 31:40.972
[sighs]

31:41.125 --> 31:42.733
We went to the same
yoga studio together.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.068
That's how we met.

31:47.222 --> 31:48.964
She lived just on
the edge of town,

31:48.982 --> 31:52.134
But she would drive down
every day to go to class.

31:52.227 --> 31:53.535
We started going
to lunch together.

31:55.230 --> 31:57.230
It was right after my divorce.

31:57.324 --> 31:58.657
I needed a friend.

31:58.809 --> 32:00.542
Yeah, I can imagine.

32:01.903 --> 32:02.920
We got close.

32:04.665 --> 32:07.499
[sighs]

32:07.593 --> 32:09.051
I can't believe this happened.
It doesn't make sense.

32:10.745 --> 32:13.096
Listen,
sometimes people in pain,

32:13.248 --> 32:14.914
They become experts
at hiding it.

32:14.934 --> 32:17.659
But she wasn't in pain,
she was happy.

32:17.678 --> 32:20.270
She had just started
seeing a new guy.

32:20.422 --> 32:22.497
I mean, I never met him,
I didn't even know his name,

32:22.516 --> 32:24.441
But I think she was in love.

32:26.094 --> 32:27.444
Love can be tricky.

32:27.595 --> 32:29.929
It's an emotional
rollercoaster

32:29.949 --> 32:31.782
That can turn someone
inside-out.

32:31.933 --> 32:34.284
No, I'm telling you,
she was happy.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.182
How much did you know
about this relationship?

32:40.200 --> 32:41.959
Not much,
she kept it pretty private.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.963
She just wouldn't do this,
she just wouldn't.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.357
You never really know
what's going on

32:49.376 --> 32:50.875
Inside somebody else's head.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.620
Trust me, I'm a psychiatrist,
and I don't even know.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.641
No, I'm telling you,
she was happy.

32:57.868 --> 32:59.977
She wasn't suicidal,
she wasn't on drugs.

33:00.204 --> 33:02.646
That wasn't her.
Someone's behind this.

33:05.225 --> 33:06.817
I'm going to demand
an investigation.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.227
Kat: Can't believe
it's Friday already.

33:09.379 --> 33:10.562
Where did this week go?

33:10.714 --> 33:12.322
It just means
you love your job.

33:12.474 --> 33:15.158
Well, the board is gonna kill me
if I'm not in time.

33:15.310 --> 33:16.735
We're announcing
my project today,

33:16.887 --> 33:18.829
So I can't afford to mess it up.
[chuckles]

33:18.980 --> 33:20.146
Hey, come here a sec.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.557
Babe, I'm gonna be late.

33:22.576 --> 33:25.651
Babe, you're the boss
and you're allowed to be late.

33:25.746 --> 33:27.487
Mm.
[dog barking in distance]

33:27.506 --> 33:29.080
[chuckles]
oh.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.132
Oh, there's vivienne.

33:34.329 --> 33:35.661
Well, that's strange.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.906
She just acted
like she didn't see me.

33:37.999 --> 33:39.924
I wouldn't take that personally.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.744
She's got her own demons
that she's dealing with.

33:42.763 --> 33:44.095
What are you talking about?

33:44.189 --> 33:46.097
Just something I noticed
when I was at her house

33:46.250 --> 33:48.767
- The other day.
- When were you at her house?

33:48.919 --> 33:50.769
I was fixing her drain.

33:50.921 --> 33:54.531
Oh, right, of course.
Her drain.

33:54.758 --> 33:57.259
- Is someone jealous?
- Ugh, please.

33:57.277 --> 33:58.443
Well, you're the one
who loaned me out

33:58.595 --> 33:59.369
Like some shirtless handyman.

34:01.265 --> 34:02.430
Well, just remember to keep
all your tools

34:02.524 --> 34:03.765
In your toolbox,
okay, honey?

34:03.784 --> 34:05.934
[laughing]

34:06.027 --> 34:08.194
So, you were at
her house, and?

34:08.288 --> 34:10.047
And she got a call.

34:11.942 --> 34:13.550
One of her friends
passed away suddenly.

34:14.961 --> 34:16.778
Oh, how terrible.

34:16.871 --> 34:18.388
Poor viv.
Well, I should go talk to her.

34:18.540 --> 34:19.890
I don't think
that's a good idea.

34:20.117 --> 34:21.874
Why?

34:21.894 --> 34:24.544
She seems... Troubled.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.622
When she got the call,
she became erratic.

34:27.641 --> 34:29.399
Paranoid, even.

34:29.626 --> 34:31.810
She started making
these wild accusations.

34:31.904 --> 34:35.721
She's convinced that someone
killed her friend.

34:35.816 --> 34:37.966
- What?
- I know.

34:37.984 --> 34:40.911
Poor thing,
she's jumping at shadows.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.730
Look, I just don't think
you should get wrapped up

34:44.825 --> 34:47.567
In all of this, especially with
your campaign on the horizon.

34:47.661 --> 34:49.311
Yeah, you're right.

34:49.329 --> 34:50.236
Of course.
[phone dings]

34:50.255 --> 34:51.088
Crap.

34:52.740 --> 34:53.982
Oh, that's the office.

34:54.075 --> 34:55.166
I gotta go.
Call me later?

34:55.319 --> 34:56.484
Uh, yeah, I'll try.

34:56.503 --> 34:57.577
I'm gonna be in meetings
all day.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.595
Okay, I'll see you tonight then.

34:58.746 --> 34:59.671
- Okay.
- Bye.

34:59.823 --> 35:00.764
Bye.

35:06.012 --> 35:08.271
[knocking]

35:15.505 --> 35:16.780
I needed to see you.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.742
[sighing]
okay.

35:26.274 --> 35:28.516
Hi, is richard there?

35:28.535 --> 35:31.369
Woman:<i> I'm sorry,</i>
<i> richard's not in today.</i>

35:31.463 --> 35:34.131
Are you sure?
He said he had meetings all day.

35:34.358 --> 35:36.299
<i> I can take a message.</i>
<i> Who's calling?</i>

35:36.451 --> 35:39.210
- It's kat, his wife.
<i> - Oh, hi, mrs. Davrow.</i>

35:39.363 --> 35:40.695
<i> Have you tried his cell?</i>

35:40.714 --> 35:43.974
I would normally,
but tonight's our anniversary,

35:44.125 --> 35:46.626
So I'm planning
on surprising him.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.871
I just wanted to make sure
he was still in the office.

35:49.964 --> 35:51.873
<i> Like I said,</i>
<i> I can take a message,</i>

35:51.892 --> 35:54.542
<i>But there's really nothing else</i>
<i> I can do for you.</i>

35:54.636 --> 35:58.655
Oh, um, I see.
All right, thanks.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.890
[phone whooshes]
oh!

36:08.909 --> 36:10.483
- Oh, kat.
- Marcos, hi.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.744
- Hi.
- Sorry, I didn't even see you.

36:12.896 --> 36:14.913
Oh, it's okay.
I can be pretty easy to miss.

36:15.065 --> 36:16.339
Oh, come on.

36:16.491 --> 36:18.008
No, I've just got
a lot on my mind.

36:18.235 --> 36:20.677
Oh, no, I totally get it.
I've had a long week too.

36:20.828 --> 36:23.180
I was handed a tough case.

36:23.331 --> 36:25.164
Anyway, what are you
doing right now?

36:25.258 --> 36:26.349
Do you wanna get a drink?

36:26.576 --> 36:27.851
We have a few years
to catch up on.

36:28.078 --> 36:29.335
Yeah, I would love to,
but I'm actually

36:29.354 --> 36:31.246
In kind of a rush.

36:31.264 --> 36:33.523
I'm trying to surprise richard,
it's our anniversary tonight.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.583
And I wanna get home
before he does,

36:35.602 --> 36:38.361
But I don't exactly know
where he is at the moment, so...

36:38.588 --> 36:41.089
Do you want me
to track him down for you?

36:41.107 --> 36:43.091
Detectives are pretty good
at that sort of thing.

36:43.184 --> 36:44.850
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.929
But actually, I have
his location right here, so...

36:47.948 --> 36:49.764
Oh, see, that's the thing
about marriage.

36:49.857 --> 36:51.449
I'm not sure I'd want
my spouse to know

36:51.601 --> 36:53.935
Exactly where I am all the time.
[chuckles]

36:53.954 --> 36:55.545
That's strange.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.790
Looks like he's all the way
on the other side of town.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.960
Um, do you mind?

37:02.112 --> 37:02.844
Sure.

37:06.040 --> 37:09.875
Um, that's rustic canyon.
That's pretty remote.

37:09.970 --> 37:11.895
- Mm.
- Do you have any idea

37:12.046 --> 37:13.897
Why he might be there?

37:14.048 --> 37:16.474
Uh, no.
None.

37:16.626 --> 37:19.461
Hey, I don't wanna get
into your personal life,

37:19.479 --> 37:20.904
But the offer still stands.

37:21.131 --> 37:22.888
You know, if you want me
to track him down,

37:22.908 --> 37:25.149
I'd be happy to
for a peace of mind.

37:25.244 --> 37:28.227
Thanks, but you know,
I'm-- I'm sure it's nothing.

37:28.247 --> 37:30.062
I bet he's just trying
to surprise me.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.082
He can be pretty inventive
sometimes.

37:32.233 --> 37:33.875
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Mm-hmm.

37:36.755 --> 37:37.879
[sighs]

38:16.611 --> 38:18.962
[knocking]

38:19.113 --> 38:21.214
[dogs barking in distance]

38:25.695 --> 38:27.195
Kat.

38:27.213 --> 38:28.788
Vivienne.

38:28.882 --> 38:31.215
What-- what are you doing here?

38:31.368 --> 38:32.625
[scoffs]
I'm sorry.

38:32.719 --> 38:33.476
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

38:34.813 --> 38:36.313
Oh, actually, I am...

38:37.649 --> 38:38.982
I'm looking for richard.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.485
Richard?

38:42.712 --> 38:44.212
What would richard
be doing here?

38:44.230 --> 38:46.230
Well, I-- I don't know.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.232
Actually, I...

38:48.385 --> 38:50.476
[sighs]
sorry, I...

38:50.495 --> 38:53.496
Can you tell me where we are,
or whose house this is?

38:57.002 --> 38:59.227
It's a friend's house, but you
probably already know that.

38:59.245 --> 39:00.503
Now, if you'll excuse me,

39:00.730 --> 39:01.987
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

39:02.082 --> 39:03.006
This is private property.

39:25.271 --> 39:27.755
<i> This is richard davrow.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

39:27.849 --> 39:29.616
Come on, kat,
don't be crazy.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.211
[turn signal clicking]

39:51.890 --> 39:53.706
Lookie there,
the good stuff.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.116
Special occasion?

39:55.135 --> 39:56.968
An anniversary.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.520
Well, happy anniversary.

40:00.290 --> 40:01.623
How long?

40:01.716 --> 40:04.216
Um, a year.
Our first.

40:04.310 --> 40:07.570
[chuckles]
congratulations.

40:07.797 --> 40:09.054
Just about the time
when y'all really start

40:09.149 --> 40:09.906
To get to know each other.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.078
Have a good one, now.

40:15.305 --> 40:16.079
Thanks.

40:27.909 --> 40:30.009
[sighs]
so much for surprises.

40:38.937 --> 40:39.853
Richard?

40:46.336 --> 40:47.193
Richard?

40:50.023 --> 40:50.947
[sighs]

40:55.679 --> 40:56.619
Richard?

40:58.364 --> 40:59.914
[sighs]

41:10.360 --> 41:11.801
[gasps]

41:11.953 --> 41:13.711
Happy anniversary.

41:13.863 --> 41:15.472
Um...
[chuckles]

41:15.623 --> 41:16.973
You thought I forgot,
didn't you?

41:17.200 --> 41:18.224
No.

41:21.888 --> 41:24.296
It's one of a kind.

41:24.390 --> 41:26.557
Handmade by that
mexican designer

41:26.710 --> 41:30.561
You love so much--
"palomo solina."

41:30.655 --> 41:32.638
Paloma solino.

41:32.732 --> 41:33.823
It's a woman.
Thank you.

41:37.237 --> 41:40.238
Um, how was work?

41:40.390 --> 41:44.075
Ah, fine, just another day
at the office.

41:44.169 --> 41:47.578
I was worried about you.
It was getting late.

41:47.731 --> 41:50.298
I wanted to surprise you.
I bought champagne.

41:51.918 --> 41:52.842
In rustic canyon?

41:54.829 --> 41:56.596
How did you know
I was in rustic canyon?

41:59.518 --> 42:01.851
Devil's in the details, darling.

42:02.078 --> 42:03.186
Right.

42:06.766 --> 42:08.358
- I'll go open it up for us.
- Yeah.

42:12.847 --> 42:15.031
[sniffing]

42:19.262 --> 42:20.370
[sighs]

42:23.542 --> 42:24.791
[groans lightly]

42:31.941 --> 42:33.699
Hm.

42:33.718 --> 42:34.884
[phone dings]

42:37.055 --> 42:38.054
[ding]

42:40.559 --> 42:41.683
[ding]

42:56.223 --> 42:58.223
Kat: I can't believe
I'm asking you to do this.

42:58.318 --> 43:01.244
Hey, it's probably nothing.

43:01.471 --> 43:03.471
You know, a hunch
is just a hunch

43:03.489 --> 43:04.897
Until there's evidence.

43:04.991 --> 43:05.915
I hope you're right.

43:09.162 --> 43:12.997
Hey... I'm here for you.
You know that, right?

43:13.091 --> 43:14.424
Thank you.

43:15.985 --> 43:18.428
Uh, listen.

43:18.655 --> 43:21.989
Do you mind if we keep this
between you and me?

43:22.008 --> 43:23.841
I can't really risk
this kind of thing getting out.

43:23.935 --> 43:26.177
Of course.

43:26.271 --> 43:28.329
I have some leave coming up,
so it's off the books.

43:28.348 --> 43:29.680
Nothing official.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.256
[sighs]
thank you.

43:31.276 --> 43:33.501
I-- I appreciate that.

43:33.519 --> 43:35.737
I don't want this to come off
the wrong way, but...

43:37.357 --> 43:38.281
Do you need a place to stay?

43:39.859 --> 43:41.951
What do you mean?

43:42.103 --> 43:45.771
In case you need some space
from your husband?

43:45.790 --> 43:47.790
I mean, if that's what you need.

43:49.535 --> 43:51.419
Oh, um, thanks, marcos.

43:53.189 --> 43:54.613
But I don't think
that's necessary.

43:54.633 --> 43:58.192
Oh, yeah, I just wanted
to make the offer.

43:58.211 --> 44:00.862
Sometimes a break
can be a good thing,

44:00.955 --> 44:04.474
Especially in times
of... Uncertainty.

44:05.793 --> 44:09.036
I'm just, like I said,
I'm here for you.

44:09.130 --> 44:10.104
Of course.

44:22.568 --> 44:23.567
[gasps lightly]

44:23.720 --> 44:26.478
Oh my god, richard.

44:26.498 --> 44:29.148
What are you doing?
Why are you sitting in the dark?

44:29.167 --> 44:30.333
I've just been thinking.

44:31.728 --> 44:33.252
Okay, um...

44:34.839 --> 44:36.822
Is everything all right?

44:36.841 --> 44:38.841
We're all right,
aren't we, kat?

44:38.993 --> 44:42.086
I mean, I know we just moved
back to your hometown.

44:42.238 --> 44:45.497
You're stressed with work,
but you're happy, aren't you?

44:45.591 --> 44:48.851
I mean, we're happy, right?

44:51.356 --> 44:53.264
I don't know.

44:53.358 --> 44:56.859
To be honest, I think things
have been a little, um,

44:57.011 --> 44:58.528
- Off lately.
- I know.

44:58.679 --> 45:00.029
I feel it too.

45:01.424 --> 45:04.033
Is there anything
that you wanna tell me?

45:05.428 --> 45:07.111
Hm?

45:07.263 --> 45:09.455
Is there anything
you wanna ask me?

45:15.880 --> 45:18.439
- Well, actually--
- because I would hate to think

45:18.532 --> 45:21.718
That we're having issues
of any kind.

45:21.869 --> 45:24.779
Trust issues, you know,
or anything like that.

45:24.872 --> 45:26.948
You know, those are
the type of things

45:27.041 --> 45:29.976
That can tear
happy couples apart.

45:31.545 --> 45:34.230
You know, little seeds
of doubt that fester and...

45:36.125 --> 45:38.067
Make mountains
out of mole hills.

45:41.388 --> 45:44.407
I always thought
we were better than that.

45:44.558 --> 45:47.326
Don't you?
Hm?

45:51.916 --> 45:54.083
Yeah.
[chuckles nervously]

45:54.235 --> 45:57.754
I... I think you're right.

45:57.981 --> 46:00.072
I think I've just been
so exhausted and stressed.

46:00.166 --> 46:02.500
This campaign, it's making
me crazy, richard, I'm sorry.

46:02.652 --> 46:04.427
No, it's okay.
Come here.

46:04.654 --> 46:06.745
Hey.

46:06.765 --> 46:07.930
Hey, look at me.

46:11.327 --> 46:15.997
You have nothing
to feel sorry for.

46:16.015 --> 46:18.608
- All right?
- Okay.

46:18.835 --> 46:21.444
I love you.

46:21.671 --> 46:23.738
And I will always
be there for you.

46:32.365 --> 46:33.456
I love you too.

46:43.635 --> 46:45.134
[knocking]

46:50.550 --> 46:52.725
[camera clicking]

46:59.651 --> 47:00.817
[camera beeps]

47:11.888 --> 47:12.620
Hi.

47:15.908 --> 47:17.333
Turns out your hunch was right.

47:22.899 --> 47:24.841
He's seen her almost
every day this week.

47:27.236 --> 47:28.636
You've gotta be kidding me.

47:30.014 --> 47:31.180
There's more.

47:32.925 --> 47:34.350
[sighs]

47:34.501 --> 47:36.760
Richard doesn't actually
have an office.

47:36.913 --> 47:39.021
Uh, I'm sorry, what?

47:39.173 --> 47:42.249
It's an answering service.

47:42.343 --> 47:43.934
Takes his calls,
handles his mail,

47:44.028 --> 47:45.769
Stuff like that.

47:45.922 --> 47:48.347
I'm not even sure
he's a licensed doctor.

47:48.441 --> 47:50.700
I haven't had a chance
to check, but...

47:50.851 --> 47:52.201
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

47:52.353 --> 47:54.686
I'm sorry.

47:54.706 --> 47:57.039
I know it's a lot to take in.

47:57.266 --> 48:00.459
Kat?
Kat.

48:04.531 --> 48:06.865
[sighs]
can I ask you something?

48:06.885 --> 48:09.802
How well do you know
this woman, vivienne?

48:12.539 --> 48:16.133
Not well.
Um... She's our neighbor.

48:16.227 --> 48:19.470
She-- she introduced herself
to us the day we moved in.

48:19.564 --> 48:21.138
She seem friendly?

48:21.290 --> 48:22.815
At first.

48:24.810 --> 48:26.569
You know what,
then she wasn't,

48:26.720 --> 48:28.237
And richard told me
this whole story

48:28.389 --> 48:29.964
About how she was troubled

48:29.982 --> 48:31.574
And she was getting over
the death of a friend.

48:34.412 --> 48:37.638
Now, I see he was just
trying to hide everything--

48:37.657 --> 48:38.748
The affair, everything.

48:41.068 --> 48:43.377
I can't imagine how painful
this must be for you.

48:51.337 --> 48:52.553
But you know...

48:54.915 --> 48:56.933
Richard's story
wasn't a complete lie.

48:57.160 --> 48:59.101
Vivienne's friend
did die recently.

49:04.167 --> 49:05.191
[sighs]

49:14.026 --> 49:15.859
[footsteps approaching]

49:15.954 --> 49:18.696
Hey, there's my queen.

49:18.790 --> 49:19.956
I missed you.

49:22.609 --> 49:25.211
- Did you?
- Of course.

49:27.190 --> 49:28.631
How was work today?

49:28.858 --> 49:31.709
Oh, you know,
just another day in paradise.

49:31.861 --> 49:33.719
What about you?
How was your day?

49:36.808 --> 49:38.307
My day was...

49:40.369 --> 49:41.268
My day was interesting.

49:45.875 --> 49:47.149
What's this?

49:54.808 --> 49:56.550
Kat, are you spying on me?

49:56.569 --> 49:58.494
Don't try to make this
about me, richard.

49:58.645 --> 50:01.905
I mean, come on.
Vivienne?

50:02.058 --> 50:04.166
She's our neighbor,
for crying out loud.

50:04.318 --> 50:07.837
Kat, this is ridiculous.
Vivienne is my patient.

50:08.064 --> 50:09.171
Oh, really?

50:11.175 --> 50:13.567
And since when do patients
make house calls?

50:13.586 --> 50:15.903
I mean, do you even
have an office?

50:15.921 --> 50:17.421
Maybe you're not even
a real doctor.

50:17.515 --> 50:19.423
I don't know.

50:19.517 --> 50:21.500
I think you've been lying to me
our entire marriage.

50:21.519 --> 50:25.746
This is madness.
Sweetie, I told you,

50:25.839 --> 50:28.082
You need to be careful
with those pills.

50:28.100 --> 50:29.358
Come on, richard.

50:33.514 --> 50:34.822
I know you've been
with her every day.

50:37.351 --> 50:41.353
Even on our anniversary.
That house in rustic canyon.

50:41.372 --> 50:45.023
That house?
What house, kat?

50:45.117 --> 50:46.450
What are you talking about?

50:46.602 --> 50:50.546
Oh, stop it.
I tracked you, okay?

50:50.773 --> 50:53.107
I tracked you.
I know you were at that house,

50:53.200 --> 50:54.775
And when I got there,
vivienne was there too.

50:54.794 --> 50:57.778
You tracked me?

50:57.797 --> 51:00.872
Wow, kat, you should really
listen to yourself, okay?

51:00.892 --> 51:03.708
You don't even sound like you.

51:03.803 --> 51:06.228
Sweetie, this is
your imagination

51:06.380 --> 51:07.563
Taking over again.

51:07.790 --> 51:10.066
These are the same delusions
you had

51:10.217 --> 51:12.068
That made you skip town
without a trace.

51:12.295 --> 51:14.737
Don't try to psychoanalyze me,
richard, okay?

51:14.964 --> 51:15.821
Because I'm not
the only one who knows.

51:17.483 --> 51:20.076
I have a friend too.
He's a detective.

51:22.138 --> 51:24.488
Kat, the only evidence
that you have here

51:24.582 --> 51:28.751
Is proof of your own delusion.

51:28.902 --> 51:31.003
You need to cut this out
before it gets dangerous.

51:32.982 --> 51:34.173
Are you threatening me?

51:36.319 --> 51:39.678
I'm not stopping, richard.
I'm not letting this go.

51:41.841 --> 51:43.324
I'm filing for divorce.

51:43.417 --> 51:45.492
After everything
I've done for you, huh?

51:45.511 --> 51:50.180
I am not going to let you
ruin my life with your lies,

51:50.333 --> 51:51.682
With your crazy fantasies...

51:51.834 --> 51:53.609
[kat grunts]

51:57.006 --> 51:57.855
Kat.

51:58.007 --> 52:00.241
[panting]

52:20.621 --> 52:23.764
Yes, she's safe now, officer.
Thank you, we'll be there soon.

52:26.719 --> 52:28.460
They advise you
to file assault charges

52:28.479 --> 52:29.720
And try to get
a restraining order

52:29.872 --> 52:31.796
As soon as possible.

52:31.816 --> 52:34.150
Come on, is that
really necessary?

52:34.301 --> 52:35.967
He tried to kill you, kat.

52:35.987 --> 52:38.545
Alex, I-- I really don't need

52:38.639 --> 52:40.639
The added dramatics
right now, okay?

52:40.733 --> 52:42.974
I mean, I know-- I know
that he got violent, but...

52:43.068 --> 52:45.143
But what?
Don't do that, kat.

52:45.237 --> 52:47.721
Don't make excuses for him.

52:47.740 --> 52:50.749
I mean, look at yourself.
You have bruises everywhere.

52:52.077 --> 52:53.727
It's complicated.

52:53.820 --> 52:55.562
Look, I can't
file charges, okay?

52:55.656 --> 52:57.414
I'm city manager,
it'll attract attention.

52:57.508 --> 52:58.591
Good, it should.

53:00.403 --> 53:02.178
Alex, it's not
that simple, okay?

53:04.573 --> 53:06.665
He's my husband,
for christ's sake.

53:06.684 --> 53:09.018
He's not some random criminal.

53:09.245 --> 53:12.671
I mean, he lied,
and he was unfaithful.

53:12.765 --> 53:16.099
He attacked you, kat,
and he could have killed you.

53:16.194 --> 53:18.027
Look, and I'm sorry
if that will attract attention,

53:18.178 --> 53:20.103
But it should.

53:20.198 --> 53:23.515
I know he's your husband,
and I know you want to love him,

53:23.534 --> 53:26.619
But how well do you
really even know him?

53:35.862 --> 53:37.529
- Morning, kat.
- Morning, phil.

53:37.548 --> 53:39.606
Everything okay?

53:39.700 --> 53:42.218
I... I had a bit
of a rough night,

53:42.445 --> 53:44.611
But we have a big day today,
so...

53:44.705 --> 53:47.556
Yeah, yes.
Um, about that,

53:47.708 --> 53:50.542
Miriam blanchard is here,
she's waiting in your office.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.636
- Miriam?
- Yes.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.563
- From the fairmont gazette.
- Yes, I know who she is.

53:56.125 --> 53:57.524
Sorry, uh...

53:59.386 --> 54:01.462
I wonder what she wants.

54:01.555 --> 54:02.905
- Thank you, phil.
- Mm-hmm.

54:08.320 --> 54:10.395
[sighs]
miriam, hi.

54:10.489 --> 54:13.082
This is a surprise.

54:13.233 --> 54:15.809
I thought you said everything
you needed to the other day.

54:15.902 --> 54:17.811
Oh, this is not a social call.

54:17.830 --> 54:20.831
I'm here with the gazette,
strictly professional.

54:20.983 --> 54:23.425
Well, in that case,
how can I help you?

54:23.577 --> 54:26.003
So, I received a tip
this morning,

54:26.155 --> 54:27.838
And I wanted to check with you,

54:27.932 --> 54:30.173
You know, hear it straight
from the horse's mouth.

54:30.326 --> 54:31.508
Ah, okay.

54:31.660 --> 54:33.769
Um, thank you,
I appreciate that.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.754
As long as it's in
public interest,

54:35.773 --> 54:38.015
Then we have no secrets here.

54:38.167 --> 54:39.758
Oh, I think the public
has a right to know.

54:39.852 --> 54:42.444
So, I'll get right to it.

54:42.596 --> 54:44.338
Again, sorry for putting you
on the spot like this,

54:44.356 --> 54:46.598
But is it true?

54:46.692 --> 54:47.574
Are you running for mayor?

54:49.361 --> 54:52.604
Oh.
Well...

54:52.623 --> 54:55.198
I haven't announced
anything officially yet,

54:55.293 --> 54:57.960
But yes, it's certainly
something I'm considering.

54:58.111 --> 54:59.461
You sure did hit
the ground running.

55:00.798 --> 55:03.373
I mean, not even a month in
as city manager,

55:03.526 --> 55:05.542
And you've already got
your eye on the prize.

55:05.694 --> 55:08.470
Well, I think
it's a natural progression.

55:08.622 --> 55:10.531
I have over five years'
experience

55:10.549 --> 55:13.291
In city government between
ardendale, and now here.

55:13.311 --> 55:14.810
And fairmont is my home,

55:15.037 --> 55:16.294
I believe I'd make
an excellent candidate.

55:16.314 --> 55:18.147
Oh, there's no doubt about that.

55:18.374 --> 55:20.799
I just imagine,
given your history here

55:20.818 --> 55:22.818
And all that, it may hinder
your chances just a bit?

55:24.713 --> 55:26.947
And what history
might you be referring to?

55:29.218 --> 55:31.493
I think you know.
The prom.

55:32.888 --> 55:34.721
Okay.

55:34.740 --> 55:36.223
I guess you really
want to discuss this.

55:36.241 --> 55:37.958
I think I deserve some answers.

55:40.338 --> 55:43.005
You said that this
was a professional visit.

55:44.658 --> 55:46.157
It's starting to sound
awfully personal.

55:46.177 --> 55:49.178
It's all part of the job, kat.

55:49.329 --> 55:51.138
Like I said, the people
have a right to know.

55:52.666 --> 55:56.760
Look, off the record, miriam,

55:56.912 --> 55:59.021
I'm truly sorry
about what happened to you.

55:59.172 --> 56:02.766
Really, I am.
But I wasn't responsible.

56:02.918 --> 56:05.009
I was hospitalized
that night, kat.

56:05.029 --> 56:06.528
Did you know that?

56:06.755 --> 56:09.990
I could have been assaulted,
or worse.

56:11.535 --> 56:13.518
You know, I'm just lucky that
I had friends to rescue me.

56:13.537 --> 56:14.853
I didn't slip you that roofie.

56:14.872 --> 56:17.114
Then who did, kat?

56:17.266 --> 56:20.525
[scoffs]
you were so jealous,

56:20.544 --> 56:21.710
And everybody knew it.

56:23.105 --> 56:24.771
You couldn't stand
how much attention

56:24.865 --> 56:26.531
Marcos was giving me
that night.

56:26.625 --> 56:28.108
It was a party, miriam.

56:28.127 --> 56:30.886
There was a lot going on--
a lot of people,

56:31.037 --> 56:33.055
A lot of drinking,
a lot of boys.

56:33.206 --> 56:35.707
And for the record,

56:35.726 --> 56:38.877
I left before any of it
even happened.

56:38.971 --> 56:40.562
Then why'd you skip town?

56:40.789 --> 56:42.064
I mean, the next week,
you just fled.

56:44.293 --> 56:47.628
Have you ever been accused
of something that you didn't do?

56:47.646 --> 56:50.572
It was as if the whole world
turned on me overnight.

56:52.410 --> 56:55.986
And the truth is,
I don't know what was going on

56:56.080 --> 56:58.305
Between you and marcos,
but it didn't feel good.

56:58.323 --> 56:59.990
And in the end,

57:00.142 --> 57:01.375
I thought it was best
that it didn't concern me.

57:03.646 --> 57:05.479
And I'm not gonna lie,
miriam, it hurt.

57:05.497 --> 57:09.073
And on top of that,
I was ostracized.

57:09.168 --> 57:12.002
I felt like there was nothing
left for me in this town.

57:12.154 --> 57:13.095
So, I left.

57:18.177 --> 57:21.103
But I'm back now,
and I have nothing to hide.

57:30.673 --> 57:31.947
[door opens]

57:42.609 --> 57:45.085
Are you kidding me?
The nerve.

58:01.294 --> 58:02.644
[door opens]
man: All rise.

58:20.723 --> 58:22.889
Well, I see we have
the press here today.

58:22.908 --> 58:25.575
You appreciate that today
is just an arraignment.

58:25.669 --> 58:26.835
There's no jury.

58:26.987 --> 58:29.004
Not a bunch of excitement
for the gazette.

58:31.400 --> 58:33.658
Mrs. Davrow
is a public figure, your honor,

58:33.677 --> 58:36.253
And the public do have interest.

58:36.405 --> 58:38.514
Very well.
Proceed.

58:42.520 --> 58:43.910
Thank you, your honor.

58:44.004 --> 58:46.747
Three weeks ago,
katherine sloane,

58:46.765 --> 58:50.025
Mrs. Davrow, arrived home
to confront her husband,

58:50.252 --> 58:53.103
Richard, the accused,
with evidence

58:53.255 --> 58:55.756
Of his adulterous affair
with their neighbor,

58:55.774 --> 58:57.366
Vivienne ashbury.

58:58.869 --> 59:01.945
She told him that she would
be filing for divorce,

59:02.097 --> 59:04.598
Whereupon mr. Davrow
attacked her

59:04.691 --> 59:06.950
And attempted to strangle her.

59:07.102 --> 59:09.119
It was only by good fortune
that she was able

59:09.271 --> 59:11.362
To fend him off
with a knife in self-defense

59:11.456 --> 59:13.440
And flee to safety.

59:13.533 --> 59:14.883
Otherwise, we would be dealing

59:15.035 --> 59:16.552
With a much more serious
case today.

59:18.538 --> 59:21.372
We will be able to produce
the photographic evidence

59:21.392 --> 59:24.785
Obtained by mrs. Davrow
of the affair,

59:24.803 --> 59:27.621
And official police photographs
of the injuries

59:27.639 --> 59:31.567
Sustained by mrs. Davrow
from her husband's attack.

59:31.794 --> 59:34.052
In conclusion, your honor,
we will be able

59:34.071 --> 59:36.479
To produce enough
evidence and testimony

59:36.574 --> 59:40.075
To support a charge of assault
in the second degree,

59:40.226 --> 59:42.703
If not attempted murder.

59:48.568 --> 59:50.919
Judge: Mr. Davrow...
- Your honor.

59:51.071 --> 59:52.979
Your objection
is noted, counselor.

59:53.073 --> 59:55.832
We discussed this in chambers.

59:55.926 --> 59:59.986
Mr. Davrow is entitled
to represent himself.

1:00:00.005 --> 1:00:02.339
[whispering]
can he do that?

1:00:02.433 --> 1:00:03.432
Try and stop him.

1:00:07.271 --> 1:00:08.995
Thank you, your honor.

1:00:09.014 --> 1:00:11.164
Now, before I begin,
I think there's something

1:00:11.257 --> 1:00:12.733
That the court needs to know.

1:00:14.928 --> 1:00:16.445
This is not a case of assault.

1:00:18.674 --> 1:00:22.618
If it were, I would be
recounting how my wife

1:00:22.845 --> 1:00:25.103
Made wild and unfounded
allegations

1:00:25.122 --> 1:00:28.439
Of an extramarital affair,
after which she attacked me

1:00:28.459 --> 1:00:30.684
With a knife.

1:00:30.702 --> 1:00:33.795
In fact, if this were a case
of assault,

1:00:34.022 --> 1:00:36.298
I would be the victim,
not the defendant.

1:00:38.302 --> 1:00:40.451
But this is not a case
of assault.

1:00:40.471 --> 1:00:43.454
This is a case
of jealousy and entrapment,

1:00:43.474 --> 1:00:46.141
And kat's jealousy
and her history

1:00:46.292 --> 1:00:48.310
Of obsessive jealousy

1:00:48.461 --> 1:00:50.145
Is fiercer
than your wildest dreams.

1:00:53.208 --> 1:00:53.815
Now...

1:00:57.321 --> 1:01:00.972
Miss ashbury and I
were never lovers.

1:01:01.066 --> 1:01:02.658
She will testify to that.

1:01:04.903 --> 1:01:08.479
She will also testify
that she sought out my counsel

1:01:08.499 --> 1:01:10.499
After a friend of hers,
susan taylor,

1:01:10.726 --> 1:01:11.792
Died suddenly
from a drug overdose.

1:01:13.820 --> 1:01:15.837
But what this court
does not know...

1:01:18.233 --> 1:01:19.174
Is that I, too,
knew susan taylor.

1:01:21.327 --> 1:01:23.512
She was a patient of mine.

1:01:23.739 --> 1:01:26.664
A fragile
and deeply troubled young woman

1:01:26.684 --> 1:01:28.684
Who fell victim to transference.

1:01:28.835 --> 1:01:31.761
In her case,
it was when a patient

1:01:31.914 --> 1:01:32.813
Falls in love with her doctor.

1:01:34.583 --> 1:01:38.360
Susan taylor died in her home,
alone,

1:01:38.511 --> 1:01:42.939
After swallowing a handful
of pills called remezion.

1:01:43.033 --> 1:01:45.608
But susan taylor was never
in possession of remezion,

1:01:45.761 --> 1:01:48.762
Because remezion
is a specialty sleeping pill

1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:51.039
Prescribed only to my wife,
katherine sloane.

1:01:53.711 --> 1:01:55.693
Your honor, this is not
a case of assault.

1:01:55.713 --> 1:01:59.197
This is a case of murder
motivated by my wife

1:01:59.216 --> 1:02:02.442
Katherine sloane's
pathological jealousy disorder.

1:02:02.461 --> 1:02:05.220
She becomes violent
when she's angry,

1:02:05.371 --> 1:02:08.131
Having physically abused me
on multiple occasions,

1:02:08.283 --> 1:02:10.726
And my witness
will attest to that evidence.

1:02:10.877 --> 1:02:12.376
Vivienne: What happened?

1:02:12.471 --> 1:02:13.895
She gets angry sometimes.

1:02:15.474 --> 1:02:16.898
[whispering]
what is he doing?

1:02:18.718 --> 1:02:21.552
She also has a history
of drug and alcohol abuse

1:02:21.572 --> 1:02:23.721
Which our neighbor,
miss ashbury,

1:02:23.741 --> 1:02:25.365
Will also testify
to seeing firsthand.

1:02:29.137 --> 1:02:31.079
She's jealous and possessive,

1:02:31.306 --> 1:02:33.898
Even going so far
as to track and follow me,

1:02:33.917 --> 1:02:36.826
And to persuade
a city detective--

1:02:36.979 --> 1:02:39.813
A former lover, I may add--
to spy on me.

1:02:39.831 --> 1:02:41.423
[camera clicking]

1:02:43.243 --> 1:02:45.335
It should also be brought
to the court's attention

1:02:45.487 --> 1:02:47.153
That kat
has a questionable past.

1:02:47.172 --> 1:02:51.174
She fled fairmont years ago

1:02:51.268 --> 1:02:54.677
After a young woman
was drugged and hospitalized--

1:02:54.830 --> 1:02:58.440
A young woman who happens to be
in the courtroom today.

1:02:58.591 --> 1:03:02.760
All she did
was show affection

1:03:02.854 --> 1:03:04.762
For katherine's boyfriend.

1:03:04.782 --> 1:03:08.432
And katherine
was the main suspect

1:03:08.527 --> 1:03:11.620
In that incident-- an incident
that is still unsolved today.

1:03:14.866 --> 1:03:17.200
My wife, katherine sloane,

1:03:17.294 --> 1:03:19.628
Found out about susan taylor's
feelings towards me.

1:03:19.779 --> 1:03:21.630
Kat: Richard,
a woman has called

1:03:21.781 --> 1:03:23.948
Saying that she's been
dating you.

1:03:24.042 --> 1:03:28.361
She went over to her house
in the middle of the night.

1:03:28.380 --> 1:03:30.213
How was your run?

1:03:30.365 --> 1:03:32.474
You know,
helps me wind down.

1:03:32.701 --> 1:03:35.644
Shoved sleeping pills
down her throat...

1:03:37.147 --> 1:03:38.313
And killed her.

1:03:40.542 --> 1:03:41.149
[distorted voice]
kat?

1:03:58.985 --> 1:04:00.335
Your honor, we'll...

1:04:03.173 --> 1:04:05.465
We'll have to consider
our position.

1:04:07.752 --> 1:04:09.827
Judge: I'm sure you will.

1:04:09.847 --> 1:04:13.139
Mr. Davrow,
you're free to go for now.

1:04:14.834 --> 1:04:20.413
As for you, mrs. Davrow,
don't leave town.

1:04:20.506 --> 1:04:21.598
[gavel banging]
we're adjourned.

1:04:21.692 --> 1:04:22.858
Man: All rise.

1:04:28.273 --> 1:04:30.924
Kat, where were you on the night
of susan taylor's death?

1:04:30.942 --> 1:04:33.426
What do you have to say
about these accusations

1:04:33.445 --> 1:04:35.519
And their similarity to your
history here in fairmont?

1:04:35.539 --> 1:04:37.372
Do you plan to run
for mayor next term,

1:04:37.599 --> 1:04:38.781
Or do you plan
to postpone your run?

1:04:38.934 --> 1:04:40.375
- No comment.
- Is it true?

1:04:40.526 --> 1:04:41.710
Is it true
that you cut your funding

1:04:41.937 --> 1:04:43.937
For the overdose antidote,
narcan?

1:04:43.955 --> 1:04:45.271
What do you plan to do
to win back the trust

1:04:45.290 --> 1:04:46.381
Of your fellow constituents?

1:04:48.701 --> 1:04:50.610
You know what, kat?

1:04:50.703 --> 1:04:52.012
You almost had me
believing you.

1:04:59.545 --> 1:05:02.046
- Leaving us?
- Uh, the mayor

1:05:02.065 --> 1:05:04.215
Thought it would be smart
for me to take a few days off.

1:05:04.234 --> 1:05:05.233
[chuckles]
she didn't waste much time.

1:05:07.237 --> 1:05:09.646
This is ridiculous, marcos.
You know that, right?

1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:11.981
Those pills were prescribed
to me by richard, okay?

1:05:12.134 --> 1:05:14.300
He gave me those pills.

1:05:14.319 --> 1:05:16.152
Yeah, katherine,
but on the night

1:05:16.304 --> 1:05:17.746
Of susan's death,
your car was seen

1:05:17.897 --> 1:05:19.080
Outside susan's home.

1:05:20.825 --> 1:05:22.233
Are you investigating me?

1:05:22.252 --> 1:05:25.754
No, I'm just trying to piece
it together, that's all.

1:05:28.425 --> 1:05:29.591
So, about the car.

1:05:31.169 --> 1:05:32.761
What night was that?

1:05:32.912 --> 1:05:35.321
September 5th, Sunday.

1:05:35.415 --> 1:05:37.991
That was right after
we moved in.

1:05:38.009 --> 1:05:40.418
That-- that was the night
before I started work.

1:05:40.512 --> 1:05:42.328
Richard took my car.

1:05:42.422 --> 1:05:43.680
He borrowed it,
and he went out,

1:05:43.832 --> 1:05:45.756
And he never returned home.

1:05:45.850 --> 1:05:48.443
But he said he did come home.
He said you attacked him.

1:05:48.670 --> 1:05:49.760
Well, how could I have
attacked him?

1:05:49.854 --> 1:05:51.187
I took one of those pills.

1:05:51.339 --> 1:05:53.006
I was completely
knocked out.

1:05:53.024 --> 1:05:56.176
Okay, so you're saying
that richard used your car

1:05:56.194 --> 1:05:57.619
To go to sue taylor's house,

1:05:57.846 --> 1:05:59.788
Knowing that you'd be
unconscious.

1:06:00.015 --> 1:06:02.865
[scoffs]
completely fits, doesn't it?

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:04.867
He set me up.

1:06:05.020 --> 1:06:08.463
Except, how could richard know
that you would take the pill?

1:06:08.614 --> 1:06:09.965
He'd already left,
he wasn't there.

1:06:11.543 --> 1:06:13.134
I don't know, uh...

1:06:15.305 --> 1:06:17.305
Before he left,
he poured me a glass of wine.

1:06:17.457 --> 1:06:20.124
Don't forget to cover
your tracks.

1:06:20.143 --> 1:06:22.218
Maybe he put something in it,
you know, just to make sure.

1:06:22.312 --> 1:06:25.054
You can't prove that.

1:06:25.207 --> 1:06:26.481
But it's the only thing
that makes sense.

1:06:27.818 --> 1:06:28.817
Maybe.

1:06:30.303 --> 1:06:31.820
Okay, let's move on.

1:06:31.971 --> 1:06:34.047
Vivienne said that later
in the week,

1:06:34.065 --> 1:06:36.549
You showed up
to sue taylor's house

1:06:36.642 --> 1:06:38.309
- In rustic canyon?
- Yes.

1:06:38.328 --> 1:06:40.386
But I didn't even know
that was her house.

1:06:40.405 --> 1:06:41.812
I didn't even know
she and vivienne were friends,

1:06:41.906 --> 1:06:43.331
Not until today in court.

1:06:44.909 --> 1:06:47.227
But I guess that explains
why vivienne was there, right?

1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:48.728
Maybe cleaning out her things.

1:06:48.821 --> 1:06:51.006
And why richard
was there helping her,

1:06:51.157 --> 1:06:52.490
Or hiding evidence,
I don't know.

1:06:52.509 --> 1:06:53.508
Uh...

1:06:55.328 --> 1:06:56.753
I was there
looking for richard.

1:06:56.905 --> 1:06:57.846
You remember that, don't you?

1:06:58.073 --> 1:06:59.014
I remember.

1:07:00.909 --> 1:07:02.742
I'm just trying to piece
the story together.

1:07:02.835 --> 1:07:04.244
Can I ask you something else?

1:07:04.262 --> 1:07:06.521
[scoffs]
yeah.

1:07:06.672 --> 1:07:08.097
What were you doing
outside of vivienne's home

1:07:08.250 --> 1:07:09.024
In the middle of the night?

1:07:11.102 --> 1:07:12.819
[camera clicking]

1:07:24.449 --> 1:07:25.331
I was out for a run.

1:07:26.785 --> 1:07:28.526
In the middle of the night?

1:07:28.545 --> 1:07:32.029
Yeah, it helps me calm down,
especially when I'm stressed.

1:07:32.049 --> 1:07:36.459
Kat... I want to believe you.

1:07:36.611 --> 1:07:39.054
I really do, but you see
how this looks, right?

1:07:39.205 --> 1:07:41.447
I mean, you're running around
in the middle of the night.

1:07:41.541 --> 1:07:44.133
Your car is parked
outside susan's home

1:07:44.286 --> 1:07:45.802
On the night that
she's murdered.

1:07:45.954 --> 1:07:49.064
And days later, you showed up
to the scene of the crime.

1:07:49.215 --> 1:07:51.024
This is absurd, okay?

1:07:52.718 --> 1:07:54.627
I didn't know that woman,
I promise you.

1:07:54.646 --> 1:07:56.237
I had no idea
where she lived.

1:07:56.389 --> 1:07:57.888
So, you're saying
you didn't know

1:07:57.908 --> 1:07:59.799
Sue taylor at all?

1:07:59.818 --> 1:08:01.242
- That's right.
- Kat...

1:08:03.914 --> 1:08:06.081
I've seen your phone records.

1:08:06.308 --> 1:08:08.065
She called you
right before she died.

1:08:08.085 --> 1:08:10.234
The call lasted four minutes.

1:08:10.328 --> 1:08:13.571
Yes, she called me to tell me
that she had been seeing richard

1:08:13.590 --> 1:08:15.924
And that she was pregnant
with his child, that's it.

1:08:16.151 --> 1:08:19.152
You realize
that's motive, right?

1:08:19.170 --> 1:08:22.822
Oh, come on, marcos.
I didn't kill anyone, okay?

1:08:22.841 --> 1:08:24.657
Can't you see that richard's
behind all of this?

1:08:24.676 --> 1:08:26.083
He's manipulated everything!

1:08:26.103 --> 1:08:28.511
Okay, calm down.

1:08:28.605 --> 1:08:30.897
Do you have someplace
you can stay, someplace safe?

1:08:32.667 --> 1:08:35.501
- Yes.
- Okay, go there right away.

1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:37.445
Keep your phone on you,
give me the address.

1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:44.268
Oh, and...
You heard the judge.

1:08:44.287 --> 1:08:46.621
I know how you like to run off
when things get tough.

1:08:52.629 --> 1:08:54.537
Well, that was a day.

1:08:54.631 --> 1:08:57.357
Yeah, and a half.

1:08:57.375 --> 1:08:59.300
I've got a headache
the size of dodger stadium.

1:08:59.527 --> 1:09:01.452
- Have you got any aspirin?
- Yeah.

1:09:01.471 --> 1:09:03.863
It's back in that bathroom
back there.

1:09:03.956 --> 1:09:05.473
I'll pour us a glass of wine.

1:09:05.625 --> 1:09:08.125
I would love that.
I could use one.

1:09:08.219 --> 1:09:08.977
[whispering]
hey.

1:09:11.964 --> 1:09:13.148
You were great today.

1:09:52.247 --> 1:09:53.188
- Find what you're looking for?
- [gasps]

1:09:55.083 --> 1:09:57.083
Yep, uh,
there's just one left.

1:09:57.101 --> 1:09:58.768
But my headache is massive,
I'll need to run out

1:09:58.862 --> 1:10:01.529
- And grab some more.
- Oh, don't be silly.

1:10:01.756 --> 1:10:03.364
- I got something stronger.
- Um...

1:10:05.368 --> 1:10:06.367
What is that?

1:10:06.594 --> 1:10:08.611
Painkillers.

1:10:08.763 --> 1:10:10.163
Best on the market.

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:13.190
No, really, aspirin usually
does the trick for me.

1:10:13.284 --> 1:10:14.709
I'll be right back.

1:10:14.860 --> 1:10:16.360
You don't know
what you're missing.

1:10:16.454 --> 1:10:18.028
[muffled]
what are you doing?

1:10:18.048 --> 1:10:19.272
- Stop it!
- Let me help you

1:10:19.290 --> 1:10:21.007
- Wash that down.
- Oh!

1:10:22.444 --> 1:10:23.551
Kat: You know, I went
to court this morning

1:10:23.703 --> 1:10:26.112
As an assault victim,
and wound up

1:10:26.130 --> 1:10:28.014
Leaving as a murder suspect.

1:10:29.392 --> 1:10:30.950
How does it even happen?

1:10:30.969 --> 1:10:33.061
Richard's shrewd,
he's smart.

1:10:33.212 --> 1:10:34.729
We've always known that
about him.

1:10:34.956 --> 1:10:38.066
But a murderer?
I mean, manipulative, yes.

1:10:39.552 --> 1:10:41.694
Unfaithful, sure.
But a killer?

1:10:43.982 --> 1:10:45.965
How could I miss that, alex?

1:10:46.058 --> 1:10:47.742
Kat, you can't
blame yourself.

1:10:47.893 --> 1:10:50.136
This is not your fault,
and you were in love.

1:10:50.154 --> 1:10:52.138
That blindsides everything.

1:10:52.231 --> 1:10:53.973
Yeah, but I should have
seen it.

1:10:53.992 --> 1:10:56.251
You know, I work in politics,
for christ's sake.

1:10:56.478 --> 1:10:57.901
I mean,
reading people's my job, right?

1:10:57.996 --> 1:10:59.587
This is not your fault.

1:10:59.814 --> 1:11:02.331
I mean, richard,
he's a master manipulator.

1:11:02.425 --> 1:11:04.908
He knows how to seduce people,
how to hypnotize them.

1:11:04.928 --> 1:11:07.262
I'm not people, I'm his wife.

1:11:07.489 --> 1:11:10.323
And he's a sociopath, kat.
Textbook.

1:11:10.341 --> 1:11:12.249
And a narcissist.

1:11:12.269 --> 1:11:14.269
I mean, these people,
they know what they're doing.

1:11:15.997 --> 1:11:17.397
Nothing makes sense
to me anymore.

1:11:19.167 --> 1:11:20.683
I don't know up from down,
left from right,

1:11:20.777 --> 1:11:23.019
Everything's sideways.

1:11:23.113 --> 1:11:25.095
I mean, my husband
turned out to be a monster,

1:11:25.189 --> 1:11:26.522
So what does that make me?

1:11:26.674 --> 1:11:29.099
You're better off without him,
that's for sure.

1:11:29.119 --> 1:11:31.694
And kat, you are so much
stronger than this.

1:11:31.788 --> 1:11:34.013
And we're not gonna let him
get away with it.

1:11:34.032 --> 1:11:35.456
The evidence will prove itself.

1:11:35.608 --> 1:11:37.350
I hope you're right.

1:11:37.443 --> 1:11:40.944
You know,
I never liked richard.

1:11:40.964 --> 1:11:42.538
And I mean,
I didn't wanna tell you,

1:11:42.690 --> 1:11:44.465
Because he's your husband,
and I tried to like him.

1:11:44.617 --> 1:11:47.451
But, he always
gave me the creeps.

1:11:47.470 --> 1:11:50.212
He was always so possessive
of you.

1:11:50.365 --> 1:11:51.264
I know.

1:11:53.368 --> 1:11:54.642
I should have paid
more attention

1:11:54.794 --> 1:11:56.369
When I knew
you didn't like him.

1:11:56.387 --> 1:11:58.146
I mean, you never even
visited us in ardendale,

1:11:58.297 --> 1:12:01.040
- Not even once.
- I know, I'm sorry.

1:12:01.059 --> 1:12:02.650
I guess I just thought
it would be easier

1:12:02.877 --> 1:12:04.819
To distance myself
from both of you.

1:12:06.472 --> 1:12:07.947
But I'm really glad
you're here now.

1:12:09.475 --> 1:12:11.884
Me too,
I missed you so much.

1:12:11.903 --> 1:12:13.235
I have an idea.

1:12:13.388 --> 1:12:14.720
Why don't we just
get outta here,

1:12:14.739 --> 1:12:16.572
Grab some dinner,
just lighten things up?

1:12:16.724 --> 1:12:18.499
Well, I wish I could,
but I promised marcos

1:12:18.651 --> 1:12:20.242
That I'd stay put.

1:12:20.395 --> 1:12:22.061
I mean,
even he doesn't trust me.

1:12:22.154 --> 1:12:24.230
He's just trying
to protect you.

1:12:24.248 --> 1:12:25.506
All right, then,
I'll make a quick run.

1:12:25.658 --> 1:12:27.508
I'll grab some food,
some wine,

1:12:27.735 --> 1:12:29.585
Maybe a gallon or two
of ice cream.

1:12:29.679 --> 1:12:31.012
There's nothing a little
chocolate chip cookie dough

1:12:31.239 --> 1:12:33.348
Can't fix.
It'll be just like old times.

1:12:33.575 --> 1:12:36.092
That sounds really amazing
right now.

1:12:36.244 --> 1:12:38.001
Great, I shouldn't be more
than half an hour.

1:12:38.021 --> 1:12:39.912
And then when I get back,
we can hunker down

1:12:39.931 --> 1:12:42.690
- With a bad chick flick.
- Okay, that sounds perfect.

1:12:47.847 --> 1:12:49.680
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

1:12:49.774 --> 1:12:53.034
Yeah.
Like you said,

1:12:53.261 --> 1:12:55.370
Nothing a little ice cream
can't fix.

1:12:55.521 --> 1:12:56.662
See you soon.

1:12:59.376 --> 1:13:00.541
[door closes]

1:13:11.963 --> 1:13:13.888
[tv playing]

1:14:01.496 --> 1:14:04.346
Hey, pete, it's marcos.
Any updates?

1:14:04.441 --> 1:14:05.440
Pete:<i> Not yet.</i>

1:14:07.018 --> 1:14:09.610
Okay, um, keep me posted.

1:14:09.762 --> 1:14:11.353
I wanna know
as soon as you do.

1:14:11.448 --> 1:14:12.572
<i> You got it.</i>

1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:18.453
[dog barking in distance]

1:14:20.457 --> 1:14:22.623
[car approaching]

1:14:26.463 --> 1:14:27.795
That was fast.

1:14:29.949 --> 1:14:31.424
[knocking]

1:14:33.027 --> 1:14:34.543
[sighs]
coming.

1:14:34.637 --> 1:14:37.196
[chuckles]

1:14:37.215 --> 1:14:38.639
Did you forget your keys again?

1:14:54.382 --> 1:14:56.640
[gasps]
vivienne.

1:14:56.659 --> 1:14:59.719
Kat... Please help me.

1:14:59.737 --> 1:15:00.828
Vivienne, wait.

1:15:02.665 --> 1:15:05.833
Vivienne, wake up.
Vivienne, can you hear me?

1:15:05.985 --> 1:15:06.959
Vivienne, wake up!

1:15:16.087 --> 1:15:18.495
Kat?
I tried to call you.

1:15:18.515 --> 1:15:20.181
Wanted to see if you wanted
red or white.

1:15:22.076 --> 1:15:23.425
Kat?

1:15:23.578 --> 1:15:25.686
[tv playing faintly]

1:15:31.252 --> 1:15:32.752
Kat?

1:15:32.770 --> 1:15:35.029
[phone buzzing]

1:15:39.184 --> 1:15:40.426
Hey, alex, what's up?

1:15:40.444 --> 1:15:41.852
She's gone.

1:15:41.871 --> 1:15:43.946
Wait, what are--
what are you talking about?

1:15:44.098 --> 1:15:46.265
She's gone, I mean,
all of her stuff is here,

1:15:46.358 --> 1:15:48.267
Her bag is here,
but she's gone.

1:15:48.286 --> 1:15:49.769
I went out to get dinner,
and then when I came back...

1:15:49.862 --> 1:15:51.546
Wait, wait,
you left her alone?

1:15:51.773 --> 1:15:53.196
<i> I only stepped out</i>
<i> for a minute.</i>

1:15:53.291 --> 1:15:54.715
[sighs]
it's richard.

1:15:54.867 --> 1:15:56.442
<i> I know it's richard.</i>

1:15:56.460 --> 1:15:58.219
Stay there.
Wait for my call.

1:16:06.137 --> 1:16:08.563
[phone ringing]

1:16:08.790 --> 1:16:11.290
- Pete?
-<i> Results came back positive.</i>

1:16:11.383 --> 1:16:13.067
<i> - As you thought.</i>
- I knew it.

1:16:33.998 --> 1:16:35.214
Damnit.

1:16:39.487 --> 1:16:42.321
Pete?
Hey, I need a warrant.

1:16:42.340 --> 1:16:43.431
Can you wake up the judge?

1:16:53.092 --> 1:16:55.443
Richard: Wakey, wakey.

1:16:55.594 --> 1:16:58.854
- Hi.
- Richard?

1:16:58.948 --> 1:17:00.072
Where are we?

1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:02.783
- Where's vivienne?
- Shh.

1:17:05.513 --> 1:17:08.197
If I tell you now,
I'll ruin the surprise.

1:17:08.349 --> 1:17:10.774
Richard, what have you done?

1:17:10.868 --> 1:17:12.627
Please, don't do this, richard.

1:17:12.854 --> 1:17:15.521
Sweetheart,
I'm not doing anything.

1:17:15.539 --> 1:17:18.132
You are.
I'm not even here.

1:17:20.528 --> 1:17:22.211
Come on.

1:17:22.363 --> 1:17:24.472
You've got one last place
you have to be.

1:17:26.550 --> 1:17:28.550
- Richard, please.
- Oh.

1:17:28.645 --> 1:17:31.461
Baby, don't beg.

1:17:31.481 --> 1:17:33.389
It makes you sound weak,
and you're not weak,

1:17:33.483 --> 1:17:34.874
You're strong.

1:17:34.892 --> 1:17:37.318
Mwah.
Come on.

1:17:37.545 --> 1:17:40.804
I don't understand.
What is this?

1:17:40.823 --> 1:17:43.640
Oh, this is the final scene
of your disappearing act--

1:17:43.660 --> 1:17:45.159
Your grand finale.

1:17:45.310 --> 1:17:48.237
What are you talking about?
Richard.

1:17:48.389 --> 1:17:50.222
What are you talking about?

1:17:50.241 --> 1:17:52.241
Alex will get home
and she'll see I'm gone.

1:17:52.393 --> 1:17:53.726
She and marcos are gonna
be looking for me.

1:17:53.819 --> 1:17:55.152
Oh yeah, I'm planning on that.

1:17:55.171 --> 1:17:57.413
They'll come looking
for you too, you know.

1:17:57.507 --> 1:17:58.989
You think you're really gonna
get away with this?

1:17:59.008 --> 1:18:00.824
You left a trail
of evidence behind you.

1:18:00.843 --> 1:18:02.902
No, sweetheart,<i> you</i> left a trail
of evidence behind, okay?

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:04.753
Your fingerprints
are all over the suicide note

1:18:04.847 --> 1:18:06.755
And the bottle of pills
that killed vivienne.

1:18:06.908 --> 1:18:11.001
They're all over her clothes,
her hair, her face, her body.

1:18:11.020 --> 1:18:13.579
But why vivienne?
She was on your side.

1:18:13.597 --> 1:18:16.357
You know, I thought that too,
I really did.

1:18:16.508 --> 1:18:17.917
But she just couldn't mind
her own business, you know?

1:18:17.935 --> 1:18:19.435
She's so nosey.

1:18:19.587 --> 1:18:20.677
You two are a lot more alike
than I thought,

1:18:20.771 --> 1:18:22.104
You know, you should talk.

1:18:22.256 --> 1:18:23.322
You're always snooping around
and spying.

1:18:25.017 --> 1:18:27.593
She found something.

1:18:27.611 --> 1:18:29.036
Wow.

1:18:29.263 --> 1:18:32.431
You are so smart.
She did find something.

1:18:32.450 --> 1:18:34.616
But that wasn't the problem.
The problem was that

1:18:34.711 --> 1:18:37.211
She didn't trust me,
just like you didn't trust me,

1:18:37.362 --> 1:18:39.880
Just like sue taylor
didn't trust me.

1:18:40.032 --> 1:18:42.441
She was carrying
your baby, richard.

1:18:42.460 --> 1:18:44.201
I know, and that really
would have worked out

1:18:44.220 --> 1:18:45.869
If she hadn't called you, right?

1:18:45.888 --> 1:18:49.798
She betrayed my trust
just like everyone.

1:18:49.951 --> 1:18:52.618
And you know how
we can't have a relationship

1:18:52.636 --> 1:18:54.228
Built without trust, right?

1:18:54.379 --> 1:18:56.121
Richard, don't-- nobody would
believe I'd do this.

1:18:56.140 --> 1:18:57.714
Hm, I don't know about that.

1:18:57.734 --> 1:18:59.382
The evidence is pretty stacked
against you.

1:18:59.477 --> 1:19:01.736
Plus, the murder charges,

1:19:01.887 --> 1:19:03.571
And with all of your
sketchy past.

1:19:03.798 --> 1:19:06.131
Well, let's just say
everybody knows,

1:19:06.150 --> 1:19:08.984
When the going gets tough,
kat gets going, right?

1:19:09.136 --> 1:19:11.153
Marcos will find me.

1:19:11.247 --> 1:19:13.305
He's been tracing you
since the very first day.

1:19:13.324 --> 1:19:14.915
There is no way that you're
going to get out of this.

1:19:15.067 --> 1:19:16.399
- Ow!
- Oh, sweetheart.

1:19:16.494 --> 1:19:18.494
There's nothing to trace.

1:19:18.588 --> 1:19:22.405
I drove your car here
and I left my cellphone at home.

1:19:22.425 --> 1:19:23.591
Sorry.

1:19:25.653 --> 1:19:28.320
- The devil's in the details.
- Yes, it is.

1:19:28.413 --> 1:19:31.432
But now, time is of the essence.

1:19:31.583 --> 1:19:33.416
Please, richard, no.

1:19:33.436 --> 1:19:36.586
Oh... I know.

1:19:36.606 --> 1:19:38.664
But they're gonna come
find your car soon,

1:19:38.682 --> 1:19:41.258
And you have to be dead
by then, right?

1:19:41.352 --> 1:19:42.943
Suicide by drowning.

1:19:44.947 --> 1:19:47.840
Aw.
Come here.

1:19:47.858 --> 1:19:49.909
You know how beautiful
you are though, right?

1:19:51.436 --> 1:19:52.953
- [shouts]
- [muffled shouting]

1:19:54.273 --> 1:19:55.623
[grunting]

1:19:56.959 --> 1:19:58.417
[panting]

1:20:17.313 --> 1:20:19.605
[groaning]

1:20:23.561 --> 1:20:25.820
[panting]

1:20:34.238 --> 1:20:36.497
[panting]

1:21:18.949 --> 1:21:20.040
[gasps lightly]

1:21:43.715 --> 1:21:45.290
You know,
you just did me a favor.

1:21:45.384 --> 1:21:46.959
They'll never believe
it was suicide.

1:21:47.052 --> 1:21:48.569
No one's gonna find your body.

1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:50.362
They'll just think you
disappeared like you always do.

1:21:52.909 --> 1:21:55.150
Richard.

1:21:55.302 --> 1:21:56.744
Stop.

1:21:56.895 --> 1:21:59.896
Put the rock down.

1:21:59.990 --> 1:22:02.416
Oh my god.
Marcos, thank god.

1:22:02.567 --> 1:22:04.977
She was trying to kill me.

1:22:04.995 --> 1:22:07.570
- Don't believe him, marcos.
- Cut the act, richard.

1:22:07.590 --> 1:22:09.982
The autopsy
came back on sue taylor.

1:22:10.075 --> 1:22:11.759
They found your dna everywhere--

1:22:11.986 --> 1:22:13.910
Under her fingernails,
on her teeth,

1:22:13.930 --> 1:22:15.763
And in her unborn child.

1:22:15.990 --> 1:22:17.932
No.

1:22:18.083 --> 1:22:19.992
Marcos, that girl
was crazy, okay?

1:22:20.010 --> 1:22:21.493
I never even touched her.

1:22:21.586 --> 1:22:23.328
Like you didn't
touch vivienne?

1:22:23.347 --> 1:22:25.255
We found her body, richard.

1:22:25.274 --> 1:22:26.941
That was kat!

1:22:27.168 --> 1:22:29.944
It's over, richard.
It's over, give it up.

1:22:31.596 --> 1:22:35.190
You see?
Everyone betrays me.

1:22:35.342 --> 1:22:37.009
None of this is even
my fault.

1:22:37.102 --> 1:22:39.286
You can tell
your story in court,

1:22:39.438 --> 1:22:40.955
Like you did before.

1:22:43.851 --> 1:22:45.626
[police sirens in distance]

1:22:50.691 --> 1:22:52.024
[handcuffs clicking]

1:22:52.117 --> 1:22:53.542
I just want everyone
to know the truth.

1:22:53.636 --> 1:22:56.195
- Then they'll see.
- Everyone will see, richard.

1:22:56.213 --> 1:22:57.763
Everyone will see the truth.

1:23:00.367 --> 1:23:02.884
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1:23:02.979 --> 1:23:04.627
Yeah, thank you.

1:23:04.647 --> 1:23:07.889
You're safe now.
Backup's on the way.

1:23:08.042 --> 1:23:09.966
Turns out richard davrow
wasn't even his real name.

1:23:09.986 --> 1:23:12.987
It was logan.
Logan caine.

1:23:13.214 --> 1:23:15.489
He had a criminal history
a mile long.

1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:18.900
How is that even possible?
How did he get those pills?

1:23:19.053 --> 1:23:21.829
We don't know for sure.

1:23:22.056 --> 1:23:24.981
Mail order, maybe.
I mean, he was smart.

1:23:25.001 --> 1:23:27.984
He was a conman,
conned his way through life.

1:23:28.078 --> 1:23:30.820
Managed to fool everyone.

1:23:30.914 --> 1:23:33.899
Yeah, even me.
Especially me.

1:23:33.917 --> 1:23:36.010
Kat, it wasn't your fault.

1:23:36.161 --> 1:23:38.070
Yeah, I mean,
he fooled all of us.

1:23:38.088 --> 1:23:41.015
And I'm sorry, kat.
I should have believed you.

1:23:41.166 --> 1:23:44.259
Well, he would have killed
me too if it weren't for you.

1:23:44.411 --> 1:23:45.835
No need to give me
too much credit,

1:23:45.855 --> 1:23:48.247
I was just doing my job.

1:23:48.265 --> 1:23:50.840
How did you find me, anyway?

1:23:50.860 --> 1:23:52.526
I mean, richard's plan
was pretty airtight.

1:23:52.753 --> 1:23:54.436
He made sure
we couldn't be traced.

1:23:54.588 --> 1:23:56.864
He made one mistake.

1:23:57.091 --> 1:23:58.681
He should have taken
your phone away.

1:23:58.701 --> 1:24:00.200
We managed to track you.

1:24:00.352 --> 1:24:03.203
Wait, don't you need,
like, a warrant for that?

1:24:03.355 --> 1:24:05.447
[chuckles]
not too hard to get,

1:24:05.599 --> 1:24:08.450
Not with a questionable suspect.

1:24:08.602 --> 1:24:10.269
And was I
a questionable suspect?

1:24:10.287 --> 1:24:12.287
Without a doubt.
[chuckles]

1:24:12.439 --> 1:24:14.439
You always
kept me guessing, kat.

1:24:14.533 --> 1:24:17.217
I already let you
get away once.

1:24:17.369 --> 1:24:19.202
I wasn't gonna
let it happen again.

1:24:19.221 --> 1:24:23.057
Well, none of you need
to worry about that.

1:24:23.284 --> 1:24:24.391
I'm not going anywhere
anytime soon.

1:24:26.303 --> 1:24:28.228
This is home.
I'm home now.

1:24:29.973 --> 1:24:32.048
With all you guys.

1:24:32.068 --> 1:24:34.717
So, let's dig in, okay?
Seconds, anyone?

1:24:34.737 --> 1:24:36.478
- Absolutely.
- All right.

1:24:36.630 --> 1:24:38.964
[indistinct chatter]

1:24:38.982 --> 1:24:41.241
