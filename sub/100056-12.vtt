WEBVTT

00:10.793 --> 00:12.490
Lexie, are you eating pizza?

00:12.534 --> 00:14.014
Yes. Is that odd?

00:14.057 --> 00:15.754
It is at 8:00 a.m.

00:15.798 --> 00:18.279
Fine.
I'm stress eating, Carol.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.368
I've tried stress walking
and stress crying,

00:20.411 --> 00:23.197
so this is just where I'm at.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.763
Why are you stressed?

00:24.807 --> 00:26.852
Oh, is it because
of peer evaluations?

00:26.896 --> 00:28.158
Yes.
[chuckles]

00:28.202 --> 00:31.031
Today is judgment day.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.164
We're each gonna get
called in one by one

00:34.208 --> 00:36.384
so that our bosses can
tell us all the things

00:36.427 --> 00:38.299
we anonymously said
about each other.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.866
It's horrifying.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.868
I'm not worried. Everyone knows
I've been crushing it.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.393
Strangers know
I've been crushing it.

00:45.436 --> 00:48.265
That's because yesterday, you
told three strangers at Quiznos

00:48.309 --> 00:50.224
that you're crushing it.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.661
Whatever.
I'm not sweating it.

00:52.704 --> 00:54.445
CAROL:
Guys,

00:54.489 --> 00:56.056
this is nothing to worry about.

00:56.099 --> 00:59.059
I mean, I know millennials
are awful at taking criticism.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.190
No, we're not!

01:00.234 --> 01:02.279
But if you take this
as an opportunity

01:02.323 --> 01:05.108
to get better, criticism
can be very helpful.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.631
So you're not at
all worried about

01:06.675 --> 01:08.198
what one of us might
have said about you?

01:08.242 --> 01:10.157
Oh, please.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.160
I sat in front of a class of
grumpy teenagers for 20 years.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.684
I have heard everything you can
say about my personality,

01:15.727 --> 01:17.773
my hair, oh, and the time
the toilet paper

01:17.816 --> 01:20.123
got stuck in my pants
and it looked like I had a tail.

01:20.167 --> 01:23.083
I wouldn't be so relaxed.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.737
I've seen these peer evaluations
tear intern groups apart.

01:25.781 --> 01:29.741
[chuckles] Those are some
of my fondest memories.

01:29.785 --> 01:31.308
Hmm.

01:31.352 --> 01:33.136
Well, I'm excited.
Honest evaluation

01:33.180 --> 01:36.008
is a crucial element of growth.

01:36.052 --> 01:38.141
Mm-hmm.
Being excited for evaluation

01:38.185 --> 01:40.143
is a crucial element
of being a nerd.

01:42.406 --> 01:45.366
â™ª

01:45.409 --> 01:46.932
[beep]

01:52.416 --> 01:55.680
Now, our pulmonary edema patient
is responding well to the Lasix.

01:55.724 --> 01:59.075
That means we should put
her on... Dr. Kutcher?

01:59.119 --> 02:01.860
Uh, uh, wh... The, uh, uh...

02:01.904 --> 02:03.732
Morphine?Morphine. Right.

02:03.775 --> 02:04.994
Apologies.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.909
You know, i-if you want
a helpful mnemonic

02:06.952 --> 02:08.824
for pulmonary edema,

02:08.867 --> 02:10.652
I always use L-M-N-O-P:

02:10.695 --> 02:14.569
Lasix, morphine, nitro, oxygen,
positive-pressure ventilation.

02:14.612 --> 02:17.702
I know. I just blanked.
[chuckles]

02:17.746 --> 02:20.227
Oh, and to remember that,
sometimes I think,

02:20.270 --> 02:22.838
L, M, N-- lemon-- O, P-- opera.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.187
Lemon opera.

02:25.406 --> 02:26.885
Plus, it paints a picture.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.627
Like, this fat little lemon
just belting out an aria.

02:29.671 --> 02:32.674
But she's struggling,
because of the edema.

02:34.415 --> 02:37.113
Okay. Good to know.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.680
You gonna write that down?

02:38.723 --> 02:39.768
CALEB:
I know I will.

02:39.811 --> 02:43.641
Lemon opera.
[chuckles]

02:43.685 --> 02:46.209
Okay, I'm gonna
call it there.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.559
It's time for evaluations.
Dr. Gilani, you're up first.

02:48.603 --> 02:52.259
First? W-What happened
to good old alphabetical order?

02:53.825 --> 02:55.566
You'd still be
first, Dr. Gilani.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.873
Kidding. I'm pumped.

02:57.916 --> 03:00.441
Go Lexie!

03:00.484 --> 03:03.444
That evaluation was
actually pretty painless.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.881
Time for a celebratory
slice of pizza.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.404
Well earned.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.493
Although I would
like you to pay heed

03:09.537 --> 03:11.582
to your colleagues' suggestion
that you make more of an effort

03:11.626 --> 03:13.410
to connect emotionally
with your patients.

03:13.454 --> 03:15.760
Of course. Will definitely
pay heed to that one.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.936
I was actually gonna
pay that one the most heed.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.808
Just, like, all the heed.

03:19.851 --> 03:23.638
Dr. Gilani, forging an emotional
bond can feel vulnerable.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.380
But it's often the key to
getting through to a patient.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.947
I know. I'm just not great
at the warm and fuzzy stuff.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.211
I can't even watch
kissing in movies.

03:31.254 --> 03:34.779
Unless it's less romantic
and more, like, hard sexual.

03:34.823 --> 03:38.827
Still, I'm giving you an
opportunity to test your skills.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.524
Room 506.

03:40.568 --> 03:43.179
Patient diagnosed
with intracranial aneurysm.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.660
Untreated,
her prognosis is grim.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.270
Surgery-- most likely
save her life,

03:47.314 --> 03:48.837
but to this point,
she's refusing.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.056
Why?She's afraid.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.623
It's not uncommon,
but I think

03:52.667 --> 03:55.626
if someone truly forms
a connection with her,

03:55.670 --> 03:57.454
they'll be able to persuade her.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.631
I-I feel a little weird
about the hard sexual thing.

04:00.675 --> 04:01.632
It's forgotten.

04:01.676 --> 04:02.894
Great.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.636
All right,
hit me with it.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.203
And don't pull any
punches, you two.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.292
I want the real stuff.Well, I am happy

04:09.336 --> 04:12.556
to report that your peer
evaluations were very positive.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.517
You were described as being
hardworking, thorough

04:16.560 --> 04:18.780
and a strong advocate
for your patients.

04:18.823 --> 04:19.737
MAYA:
Some would say
a relentless,

04:19.781 --> 04:22.653
migraine-inducing
vigilante.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.177
Most importantly,
they all commented

04:25.221 --> 04:27.179
on the excellence
of your clinical skills.

04:27.223 --> 04:29.312
One doctor
described you as having

04:29.356 --> 04:32.097
the "smoothest intubation
this side of the Mississippi."

04:32.141 --> 04:34.665
Wow. The west side
of the Mississippi?

04:34.709 --> 04:36.406
That's the bigger side.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.758
However, there was one piece
of constructive criticism.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.544
Of course. Uh... Can't be all
cupcakes and rainbows.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.850
Compliments are fun,
but criticism--

04:45.894 --> 04:47.591
that's where
the learning happens.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.898
Mm. It's just that
one of your colleagues

04:49.941 --> 04:53.118
found you to be a bit,
uh, condescending.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.904
Condescending?
Wow.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.645
Okay, sure.

04:59.037 --> 05:01.344
I can't tell
how you're taking this.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.912
Oh, who, me?
Oh, no. It's great.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.914
It's just-- condescending.

05:05.957 --> 05:09.483
It just seems
sort of out of left field.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.572
A bit random.
Like, where did that come from?

05:11.615 --> 05:13.835
Left field?

05:13.878 --> 05:16.664
Dr. Kenney, I'm sure your
colleague was simply

05:16.707 --> 05:18.840
pointing out that, as a doctor,
it's important to be open

05:18.883 --> 05:20.798
to others' input
and opinions.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.105
Yes. Of course.
Nothing to get hung up on.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.020
Great.
Great.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.238
We're done here.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.632
Yes. Yes, of course.

05:28.676 --> 05:31.940
Well, thank you both
for that fantastic feedback.

05:31.983 --> 05:34.334
Mm.Mostly fantastic feedback.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.684
You know, I mean, a couple
quibbles here and there,

05:36.727 --> 05:38.729
but... yeah.

05:38.773 --> 05:42.080
Pretty good.
Pretty good feedback.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.912
Do you have any pain in
your lower thigh or calf?

05:47.956 --> 05:50.219
No, just the spot
where they sliced me open

05:50.262 --> 05:51.916
and sawed my hip joint.

05:51.960 --> 05:52.917
Yeah.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.832
That tends to be an ouchie.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.965
The good news is,
you seem to be blood clot-free.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.403
Okay.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.884
Let's, uh, switch him
to an oral oxycodone

06:02.927 --> 06:05.277
and use the IV for
breakthrough pain only.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.976
Got it.Or-or whatever you
want. Dealer's choice.

06:08.019 --> 06:10.021
I mean, I don't want
to be "condescending"

06:10.065 --> 06:11.762
and tell you what to do.

06:11.806 --> 06:14.112
No, please, tell me what to do.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.593
That's pretty much your job.

06:19.596 --> 06:22.991
Well, at least
you appreciate me, Dennis.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.254
You've always been
so good to me.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.778
Oh, no, are you dying?

06:27.822 --> 06:30.999
I thought you at least
had another good year or two.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.261
No.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.828
I-It's this peer evaluation.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.830
Someone called me
"condescending."

06:35.873 --> 06:37.005
Can you believe that?

06:37.048 --> 06:38.528
I mean, not that
I'm bothered by it.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.051
Yeah, you seem real chill.

06:40.095 --> 06:42.402
[exhales]

06:42.445 --> 06:44.404
It's just, it's just so off.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.057
I mean, it's obviously
coming from a place

06:46.101 --> 06:48.146
of insecurity, you know?

06:48.190 --> 06:49.844
Like, the criticism tells you
more about the person

06:49.887 --> 06:52.412
who's giving it than the person
who's receiving it.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.240
Carol, I get it.
It's hard not to get defensive

06:55.284 --> 06:57.852
when you get feedback,
but I find it best

06:57.895 --> 07:00.158
to focus not
on who gave the critique,

07:00.202 --> 07:02.291
but what I can do
to learn from it.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.425
Nope, I want to know
who said it.

07:08.079 --> 07:09.907
Hi, I'm Dr. Gilani.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.909
I'm gonna be helping
out with your case.

07:11.953 --> 07:14.477
I understand you've been
diagnosed with an aneurysm

07:14.521 --> 07:16.131
but you're refusing surgery?

07:16.174 --> 07:18.655
I'd rather wait
and see how things go.

07:18.699 --> 07:21.397
Right. I think
they might go bad?

07:21.441 --> 07:24.052
Well, surgery can go bad.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.968
They said they'd have
to open up my skull.

07:27.011 --> 07:29.579
True. True, true, true, true.
I guess

07:29.623 --> 07:32.887
what I really
want to know is...

07:32.930 --> 07:34.715
how you doing?

07:36.847 --> 07:38.370
Excuse me?

07:38.414 --> 07:41.939
Like, emotionally.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.552
I mean, not great.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.554
I'm in a hospital.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.120
Of course.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.514
Look, Miss Saifi.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.908
Saifi. Are you Pakistani?

07:53.951 --> 07:54.909
Yeah.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.476
No way. Me, too.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.886
Straight talk?

08:15.930 --> 08:19.237
What you have isn't
getting better on its own.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.848
Do the surgery.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.110
That's coming from me,
not one of these

08:22.153 --> 08:24.678
emotionally distant doctors.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.506
What do you say?

08:26.549 --> 08:28.029
I'll think about it.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.552
You'll think about it! Great.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.860
Emotional connection
for the win.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.340
Just grabbing some gauze.

08:40.171 --> 08:42.086
Secrets, secrets.

08:42.130 --> 08:44.349
She was just saying
that you're the best nurse,

08:44.393 --> 08:46.874
which I already know.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.659
Why, you little sweetie.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.574
[laughs]

08:51.618 --> 08:55.273
You know what? Girl,
I'm-a get you a lollipop.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.712
[laughter]Oh.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.714
You all seem in good spirits.

09:00.757 --> 09:04.544
No criticism?
Nothing too harsh?

09:04.587 --> 09:07.155
No one betrayed by a
close colleague? [laughs]

09:07.198 --> 09:09.636
It was mostly positive.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.203
Although, one comment
was pretty damning.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.422
CAROL: Really?CALEB: Yeah.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.945
Someone said I could
be more precise

09:14.989 --> 09:16.425
when administering
an endoscopic retrograde

09:16.468 --> 09:19.471
cholangiopancreatography.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.822
Oh, wow. Really?

09:21.865 --> 09:24.389
That's tough. Very personal.

09:24.433 --> 09:28.002
Yeah, but I needed
to hear it.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.178
Dr. Frost told me I
needed to do a better job

09:30.221 --> 09:32.441
connecting with patients,
so what I did was

09:32.484 --> 09:34.356
I connected with a patient.

09:34.399 --> 09:37.011
Probably saved her life.
It's a big deal.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.057
I didn't get any criticism.

09:40.101 --> 09:42.059
Obvi. Tens across the board.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.844
I mean, you all
called me arrogant,

09:43.887 --> 09:46.455
but we knew that going in.

09:47.674 --> 09:51.112
Great. You're all
taking it great.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.635
[chuckles]
Look at that.

09:52.679 --> 09:55.812
It's awesome.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.031
Carol, are you okay?

09:57.074 --> 09:59.990
Totally. I'm wonderful.

10:00.034 --> 10:04.038
Or at least I was, until I found
out that one of you Judases

10:04.081 --> 10:05.648
called me "condescending."

10:05.692 --> 10:07.041
Was it you, Daniel?

10:07.084 --> 10:09.130
Hmm? Trying to
get a leg up?

10:09.173 --> 10:10.522
Disgusting!

10:12.133 --> 10:14.657
Or was it my good bud Caleb?

10:14.701 --> 10:17.138
I'm sure the person was
just trying to be help...

10:17.181 --> 10:18.008
Oh! There she is.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.880
There she is.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.622
Carol, it wasn't me.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.928
It wasn't me.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.234
[gasps]

10:35.678 --> 10:37.898
Hey, have you seen
Carol this morning?No, but I haven't

10:37.941 --> 10:39.682
seen Daniel either, so
maybe she's killed him

10:39.726 --> 10:41.075
and gone on the lam.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.468
[laughs]

10:43.512 --> 10:46.515
Ah. That's too bad.Yeah.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.038
We thought Carol
murdered you.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.213
Guys, come on.

10:49.257 --> 10:51.085
Are we still on this
"condescending" thing?

10:51.128 --> 10:52.521
It was peer evaluations.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.523
The point is to
evaluate each other.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.220
It wasn't even
a harsh criticism.

10:56.264 --> 10:57.657
There's no way
she's still pissed.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.572
Morning, campers.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.096
Somebody's got treats.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.446
See? Everything's fine.Wha--

11:04.489 --> 11:05.882
Oh, you mean about yesterday?

11:05.926 --> 11:07.536
That is water under the bridge.

11:07.579 --> 11:10.452
Anyway, I stopped off
at my favorite bakery

11:10.495 --> 11:11.758
on my way to work.

11:11.801 --> 11:14.456
They make the best
chocolate chip cookies.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.240
So, Lexie,

11:16.284 --> 11:18.547
chocolate chip cookie for you.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.028
Chocolate chip cookie
for you.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.203
Ooh...

11:22.246 --> 11:23.683
And, Daniel,

11:23.726 --> 11:24.814
oatmeal cookie for you.

11:26.598 --> 11:29.123
I mean, I could not
pass up the opportunity

11:29.166 --> 11:30.602
to pick up some
of their delicious,

11:30.646 --> 11:33.170
award-winning
chocolate chip cookies.

11:33.214 --> 11:34.998
They also make oatmeal.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.481
Uh, Carol, not to
call you out,

11:39.524 --> 11:41.352
but are you attempting
to be mean to Daniel

11:41.396 --> 11:42.745
by giving him a cookie?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.183
This is actually
pretty amazing.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.751
Give that back!

11:48.795 --> 11:50.666
There it is.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.233
Carol, I don't understand
why you're so mad.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.583
All I did was give
some honest feedback.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.585
You really think
I'm condescending?

11:56.628 --> 11:57.978
Yeah. Sometimes
it seems like

11:58.021 --> 11:59.588
you think you know
so much more than us.

11:59.631 --> 12:03.070
But we're not your students,
we're your peers.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.072
Do you two feel this way?

12:05.115 --> 12:07.901
Nope, you're not
pulling us into this.

12:07.944 --> 12:10.164
You know what really
ticks me off? I could have

12:10.207 --> 12:11.731
said all kinds of stuff
about you, but I didn't.

12:11.774 --> 12:12.819
I held back.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.342
Oh, really?
I'd love to hear it.

12:14.385 --> 12:15.386
Okay, fine then.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.693
I think that you are cocky

12:17.737 --> 12:18.825
and full of yourself.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.609
And overconfident.

12:20.652 --> 12:23.830
Those are all synonyms
for the same thing.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.571
And I know that.

12:26.615 --> 12:29.574
You also think you're
better than us, and you're not.

12:29.618 --> 12:32.316
If anything, your confidence
makes you more likely

12:32.360 --> 12:34.362
to miss something important.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.885
And it might help
your focus

12:35.929 --> 12:37.974
if you spent less time
looking in the mirror.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.368
But the next time you do,
you might want to notice

12:40.411 --> 12:43.588
that you are dangerously close
to putting on the freshman five.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.549
Are you calling me doughy?

12:48.942 --> 12:50.421
Well, it's not just the cookies.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.644
So how we doing? Ready
to schedule that surgery?

12:55.687 --> 12:58.603
Actually, I'm not doing it.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.910
What? But you said that...

13:00.954 --> 13:02.390
That I would think about it.

13:02.433 --> 13:05.567
And I did, and I'm saying
I don't want it.

13:05.610 --> 13:06.611
But...

13:09.571 --> 13:10.833
So...

13:10.877 --> 13:13.488
So you'll get the surgery.No!

13:13.531 --> 13:16.970
Do you know how many
people die in surgery?

13:17.013 --> 13:18.319
I don't want it.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.801
My decision is final.

13:25.674 --> 13:28.329
Dr. Gilani, how goes it
with Miss Saifi?

13:28.372 --> 13:29.678
I gave surgery a heads-up,

13:29.721 --> 13:31.680
and they seemed pretty
amped to get in there.

13:31.723 --> 13:35.118
Almost too amped.
Those boys like to cut.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.296
I talked to her again,
and she won't budge.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.342
Well, that's disappointing.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.735
Were you able to develop any
sort of personal connection?

13:43.779 --> 13:45.520
Are you kidding?
We were the most connected.

13:45.563 --> 13:48.218
We both hate cricket,
which you wouldn't get.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.220
But for Pakistani girls,
it's a big deal.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.875
Dr. Gilani, I understand

13:52.919 --> 13:55.095
warm and fuzzy stuff
makes you uncomfortable,

13:55.138 --> 13:57.662
but if you want to break through
to a resistant patient,

13:57.706 --> 14:00.840
you have to get warm,
and you have to get fuzzy.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.842
Now, I want you
to try it again.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.148
And this time,
get vulnerable.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.802
Okay, fine.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.804
Don't tell surgery to
put away their knives just yet.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.763
Ah, Dr. Gilani, surgery
never puts away their knives.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.287
Those boys are butchers.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.815
Room 416, Eileen Herndon.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.819
653 milliliters.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.561
I'm really sorry you got stuck
measuring intake with me.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.650
I hope you're not feeling
crowded by my ample girth.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.260
Oh, boy.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.522
No, no, it's fine.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.959
You were clearly trying
to hurt my feelings.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.438
Well, mission accomplished.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.787
You started it.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.659
And by the way, you're
measuring the bags wrong.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.487
See, that's condescending.

14:39.530 --> 14:40.618
Is it condescending,

14:40.662 --> 14:42.359
or is it true,
and you don't like it?

14:42.403 --> 14:45.362
It's false and I hate it.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.886
I'm actually doing it right.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.670
No, you're taking
your measurements

14:48.713 --> 14:49.976
from the top of the meniscus.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.978
And as any tenth grade
chemistry student knows,

14:52.021 --> 14:54.284
you take your measurements
from the bottom of the meniscus.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.895
I'm just trying to
teach you something here.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.418
Well, you're not my teacher.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.202
Well, I should me, 'cause
maybe you'd learn something.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.464
Let me just show you how...No, no.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.684
I can do it. No, no.I just want to show you...

15:02.727 --> 15:04.251
Timmy drew a picture of me.
[chuckles]

15:05.469 --> 15:06.906
[groans]

15:11.780 --> 15:12.999
Oh, great.

15:13.042 --> 15:17.786
Look, I already told
both of you my decision.

15:17.829 --> 15:20.484
Listen, I don't think
you understand how important

15:20.528 --> 15:22.399
your case is to me.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.316
When I was a kid,
it was a week before

15:26.360 --> 15:27.970
my Little Mermaid
birthday party,

15:28.014 --> 15:30.277
and my grandma had
some pain in her chest.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.887
The doctors wanted
to put in a stent,

15:31.931 --> 15:34.890
but the procedure was invasive,
and she was scared.

15:34.934 --> 15:39.721
My family tried everything
to convince her to do it.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.723
She refused surgery,

15:41.766 --> 15:45.335
and a week later
she passed away.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.859
She never made it
to my birthday.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.950
I hear you.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.343
I want to get better, too,

15:53.387 --> 15:55.128
but I'm still really scared.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.434
I know. I know it's scary.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.829
But people love you,
and if you do this,

16:00.872 --> 16:04.441
you can go on to live
a full, healthy life.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.227
What do you say?

16:09.272 --> 16:12.884
Okay. I'll do it.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.538
LEXIE:
Okay.

16:14.582 --> 16:17.977
I'll go talk to surgery,
and we'll get back to you soon.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.199
[exhales]

16:23.243 --> 16:25.201
Wow.

16:25.245 --> 16:29.771
That was simply
incredible, Dr. Gilani.

16:29.814 --> 16:32.948
I'm sure your grandmother was
watching over you with pride.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.124
Oh, no, please.
None of that was true.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.126
[laughing]

16:39.476 --> 16:41.957
Both my grandmas are
very much alive.

16:42.001 --> 16:42.958
The stent?

16:43.002 --> 16:46.788
The birthday? The Little Mermaid?

16:46.831 --> 16:49.921
I think you're onto something
with this emotional stuff.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.011
Anyway, I'm gonna go eat a wrap.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.708
Catch you later.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.668
Usually, it's one
of the nurses

16:57.712 --> 16:58.930
that collects my urine.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.932
Yeah, well, the nurses
sometimes get mad

17:00.976 --> 17:03.022
when one of the doctors
is a little baby

17:03.065 --> 17:04.675
and sprays them with
a bag of saline.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.243
So then we have to
do their work.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.419
Oh, Carol, don't
call yourself a baby.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.247
You're an extremely
grown woman.

17:12.814 --> 17:15.425
Hmm. Feeling a little
light-headed.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.818
Mel, are you feeling dizzy?

17:16.861 --> 17:18.863
CAROL:
Whoa,

17:18.907 --> 17:20.126
his blood pressure is dropping.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.911
He has a history of
polymyalgia rheumatica.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.130
If he's on
chronic steroids,

17:24.173 --> 17:25.914
it could cause an
adrenal insufficiency.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.350
His potassium pre-op
was a little high,

17:27.394 --> 17:28.569
and his sodium's off, too.

17:28.612 --> 17:29.787
This could be
an adrenal crisis.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.398
Oh, my God, that's
a good call, Daniel.

17:31.441 --> 17:32.486
Bolus the bag.
I'm gonna push

17:32.529 --> 17:34.053
100 milligrams
of hydrocortisone.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.619
Okay, Mr. Woods, you're
gonna be fine. All right?

17:37.230 --> 17:38.492
Okay, I'll admit it.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.059
It was a pretty nice catch
on the potassium.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.451
Well, you were the one
who noticed

17:41.495 --> 17:43.062
the adrenal
insufficiency, so...

17:43.105 --> 17:45.412
[sighs]
You know...

17:45.455 --> 17:47.501
we actually make
a pretty good team.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.938
Maybe I agree.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.027
[scoffs] Really?
And I have to say,

17:52.071 --> 17:53.594
you have a funny way
of showing it.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.640
Carol, I wasn't trying
to attack you, it's just,

17:56.684 --> 17:58.686
I know that you have a lot more
life experience than I do,

17:58.729 --> 18:00.688
but sometimes,
when you talk down to me,

18:00.731 --> 18:03.125
it feels like you don't think
I have anything to offer.

18:04.213 --> 18:07.695
And it bothers me because

18:07.738 --> 18:09.000
I guess...

18:09.044 --> 18:12.787
[mumbles]:
I respect you.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.005
Excuse me?

18:14.049 --> 18:15.659
[mumbles]:
I respect you.

18:17.531 --> 18:18.923
Daniel, I can't hear...

18:18.967 --> 18:21.012
I respect you. Okay?

18:21.056 --> 18:23.189
And when you criticize
how I do things,

18:23.232 --> 18:25.626
it makes me feel like
you don't respect me.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.802
So you respect me?

18:27.845 --> 18:30.979
[scoffs]
Okay, don't be too flattered.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.981
No, it's just I honestly

18:33.024 --> 18:34.896
didn't think you cared
what I thought.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.637
Well, of course I do.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.553
I mean, you're smart,
you know your stuff.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.163
You've got
the smoothest intubation

18:41.207 --> 18:42.599
this side
of the Mississippi.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.340
[gasps]
Daniel, it was you!

18:44.384 --> 18:46.037
Oh...

18:46.081 --> 18:49.302
Look, I-I don't mean
to talk down to you.

18:49.345 --> 18:52.522
I-It's just, if I correct you
or make a suggestion,

18:52.566 --> 18:53.958
it's probably
because that's how

18:54.002 --> 18:56.004
I always treated
my best students.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.137
It's how a teacher thinks.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.009
When you see someone who has
as much potential as you do,

19:01.052 --> 19:03.881
you just want to help
them be their best.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.883
But you're absolutely right,
you're not my student.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.189
You are my peer.

19:07.233 --> 19:10.018
Oh, and I will try
to remember that.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.107
Thank you.
Yeah.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.632
I do have one additional
critique for you.
[sighs]

19:15.676 --> 19:16.894
I'm not sure you're
quite as good at

19:16.938 --> 19:18.505
taking criticism
as you thought.

19:18.548 --> 19:22.291
Yeah, I did not
handle that great.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.163
I guess I might be
a millennial.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.077
That's not
the takeaway, Carol.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.949
Mm. I don't know.

19:27.992 --> 19:30.038
I have a pair of
high-waisted jeans.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.606
It doesn't count if you
bought them in the '70s.

19:38.351 --> 19:39.874
I got you a chocolate
chip cookie.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.006
Aw.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.747
You're so much better
at being nice

19:43.791 --> 19:44.792
than you are at being mean.

19:44.835 --> 19:46.707
Yeah.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.230
Hey, Carol, y-you didn't
happen to, uh...

19:48.274 --> 19:50.928
A snickerdoodle?

19:50.972 --> 19:53.017
But how did you know?

19:56.543 --> 19:58.240
LEXIE: I'll be here
when you wake up.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.592
Good work, Dr. Gilani.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.203
Although next time,

20:04.246 --> 20:07.945
please try to draw from
a more sincere emotional-- Ooh!

20:07.989 --> 20:10.165
Is that a snickerdoodle?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.601
My favorite.

20:11.645 --> 20:12.950
You don't have any more, do you?

20:12.994 --> 20:15.301
Sorry, just the one.
[chuckles]

20:15.344 --> 20:18.217
Mm, would you smell
that cinnamon.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.742
I remember that
sweet aroma.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.788
My father used to make
a batch of snickerdoodles

20:24.832 --> 20:26.790
every Sunday morning.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.618
We'd eat them in the back seat
of our Buick

20:28.662 --> 20:30.533
on the way home from mass.

20:30.577 --> 20:34.233
And the old bear, he'd
always take the smallest one.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.670
That's, of course,
before we lost him.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.411
Oh, wow.

20:38.454 --> 20:39.847
[exhales]

20:39.890 --> 20:43.633
Dr. Frost, uh, here.

20:43.677 --> 20:46.070
Y-You take the cookie.I'm sorry.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.203
Uh, I made that up.

20:51.685 --> 20:55.079
And it's an example
of the wrong thing to do.
