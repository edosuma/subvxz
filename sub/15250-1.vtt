WEBVTT

00:28.400 --> 00:33.200
On the other side of the cosmos
in deep space

00:33.400 --> 00:36.599
a parallel universe was born.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.799
Vic's World.

00:38.800 --> 00:43.399
It was joyful. It was full of joy.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.600
Vic's World was
goddamn fucking full of joy.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.400
Things changed

03:15.400 --> 03:17.399
Vic's World now.

03:17.400 --> 03:23.600
No cops, no laws, no morality.
No order, no meaning.

04:14.400 --> 04:18.800
- How are you, Red?
- I'm OK, Ben.

04:20.800 --> 04:26.400
- Vic is getting out.
- Oh, yeah.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.000
He wanted me
to personally thank you

04:31.200 --> 04:35.600
for helping to keep
the Rough-House running smoothly

04:35.800 --> 04:37.400
while he was gone.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.800
Well, it's my pleasure.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.800
And Vic also wants you to know,
that as far as he's concerned,

04:46.000 --> 04:50.800
the entire Jules Fiamingo thing
is over.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Clean slate.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.799
So consider yourself

04:56.800 --> 05:00.000
back on the payroll.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
You know, I judge a man's life
by the way he dies.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.400
Your life is a mess, Red.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.200
How are you, Mickey?

05:49.600 --> 05:53.000
Vic is getting out.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.399
And he wanted me
to personally thank you

05:57.400 --> 06:01.600
for keeping his girl company
while he was gone.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.800
My pleasure.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.600
He thought it was really
considerate of you. He did.

06:11.200 --> 06:16.200
Only trouble is,
nobody knows where Grace Everly is.

06:16.400 --> 06:21.000
So they can give her the good news
about Vic getting out.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.400
Mickey, where's Grace?

06:27.800 --> 06:30.600
Mickey, where is Grace?

06:32.200 --> 06:36.599
I tucked her away in a nice, safe spot.

06:36.600 --> 06:41.399
You know, it's a pity
you didn't stick to just tucking.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.600
Otherwise you wouldn't be in this jam.

06:50.800 --> 06:55.000
Consider this the coup de grace.

06:55.200 --> 07:00.200
Ben, you're not gonna kill me.
You don't have the balls.

07:03.400 --> 07:07.200
I don't have the balls?

07:07.400 --> 07:11.599
Did you hear that, Sleepy Joe?
I don't have the balls.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.400
I'm "Brass Balls" Ben London.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.799
I've got balls of brass.
Brass balls has Ben.

07:18.800 --> 07:23.199
I'll kill anybody I want to kill.
Just ask Red.

07:23.200 --> 07:28.400
Oh no, Vic wanted Red dead.
Vic doesn't want me dead,

07:28.600 --> 07:33.400
till Grace is found.
And your balls belong to Vic.

07:36.200 --> 07:40.400
I'm holding all the cards, Ben.
I'm holding Grace.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.200
He's got a Grace in the hole.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.799
Rita.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.400
Hello, Mickey.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Long time, no see, sweetie.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.800
This is strictly business, Holliday.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.800
You're working tonight,
if you're in the mood.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.600
My boss is waiting.

08:59.600 --> 09:03.600
- Flamingo's outside?
- Shooting match is on.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.000
OK, bye.

09:10.600 --> 09:15.000
- Hi, Holliday. Good to see you again.
- Doctor.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.200
You want some champagne?

09:19.200 --> 09:21.000
A sip.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.000
You know Red, don't you?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.400
We discovered him sitting there
when we got in.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.200
To life.

09:39.400 --> 09:44.000
Vic is getting out.
And Vic is gonna want you dead.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.999
No, Vic's gonna want you dead.
Ask Red.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.599
Let's face it. It's mad dog time.

09:52.600 --> 09:56.599
You know how his brain works.
He's trigger happy.

09:56.600 --> 10:00.800
He'll want me dead, you dead,
Grace dead, everybody dead.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.799
He'll want you dead first. I just tried
to get my mitts into his business.

10:06.800 --> 10:12.400
But where you put your mitts
could get a fella killed quicker

10:12.600 --> 10:17.400
Not as long as I know where Grace is
and he doesn't.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.999
So the gent from back east has arrived?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.400
Lee Turner

10:25.600 --> 10:29.399
He's at the 'D'
with that conniving manager of his.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.200
Odds are still running 8 to 5.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.400
Good evening, Jules.
Mickey, welcome.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.200
Gabriella.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.800
- Good luck.
- Sweetie.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.800
- Knock'em dead.
- Watch this.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.200
- Jake.
- Flamingo.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.600
Hi, Lee.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.200
Fuck you.

12:37.400 --> 12:42.000
- I've heard nice things about you.
- I don't give a flying fuck.

12:42.200 --> 12:48.600
If there's anything I can do to make
your stay in town more comfortable,

12:48.800 --> 12:51.400
please don't hesitate to ask.

12:51.600 --> 12:56.400
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out,
Holliday.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.400
Show me.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.200
You gotta look at this thing
philosophically.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.400
You saved on bullets again.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.800
Yeah, you are the champ.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.600
It's over between Grace and me.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.399
Rita.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.200
Nice work, Holliday.
I lost a bundle tonight.

14:55.400 --> 15:00.599
There's only one in your league now.
A new fellow. Falco.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.999
Heard of him? Nicholas Falco?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.399
Talk to me again next year.
But clear it with Jules first.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.999
I hear, you may not be alive next week.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.200
I hear, Vic's getting out.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.800
Flamingo just told me.

15:20.600 --> 15:27.000
- Rita, you look lovely tonight.
- Jake, you can stick it up your ass.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.400
I missed you.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.600
Show me.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.799
This is the best way
for Grace and me to play it.

15:54.800 --> 15:58.200
I wanna see her
coming out of this alive.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.600
I owe her, in fact.

16:01.800 --> 16:07.000
Fine. And do you have a plan
on how to play it with Vic?

16:08.600 --> 16:13.000
Well, I won't know how to play it
with him until I see him.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.800
OK.

16:16.400 --> 16:21.400
I'll be at La Difference until 2:30.
Jules likes me to close up.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.999
If you want me to feed you,
get there before midnight.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.200
- That's when I shut down the kitchen.
- OK.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.799
Lee Turner
What a fraud our pal turned out to be.

16:37.800 --> 16:41.800
But gentlemen, I have great news.
Vic's getting out.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.400
Now everyone is gonna
get in everybody's way.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.399
How do you see this going down?

16:48.400 --> 16:51.999
Vic nails Ben. Vic nails Holliday.
We nail Vic.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.199
- Vic nails Ben?
- Ben's balls are getting too big.

16:56.200 --> 16:59.600
Vic will straighten that out
fast enough.

16:59.800 --> 17:04.999
I look forward to seeing Ben dead.
I look forward to seeing Vic dead.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.999
And I especially look forward
to seeing Mickey Holliday dead.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
It won't be long before this place
is wide open for us.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.800
Vic's getting out of
the funny farm tomorrow.

18:16.800 --> 18:20.199
Vic, Vic...

18:20.200 --> 18:21.600
is dead.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.400
You wish he was dead.

18:31.800 --> 18:36.200
When I tell you what he told me,
you'll wish that you were dead.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.200
Anyway...

18:39.400 --> 18:43.800
When Vic checked into that clinic
a while ago, I thought:

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
He's gonna have a nervous breakdown,
no big deal.

18:48.200 --> 18:52.000
But Vic is sick, Mick.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.000
Vic is a sick prick, Mick.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.799
Vic is a paranoid schizophrenic.

19:00.800 --> 19:05.600
Who would have thought it?
Our Vic, a paranoid schizophrenic.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.799
And I thought he was just a putz.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.799
Vic told me,

19:10.800 --> 19:15.199
that God speaks to him
all day and all night.

19:15.200 --> 19:20.999
He can't get a good night's sleep
because God won't stop yakking.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.800
And here's the bombshell, Mick.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.399
Vic does not want you dead anymore.

19:29.400 --> 19:33.200
But God does.
At least, that's what Vic claims.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.000
So, you're off the hook with Vic.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.800
But you're in deep shit with God.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.800
There are long periods of time
when Vic loses contact with reality.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.200
That means he could kill you
and not even realize it.

19:54.200 --> 19:58.800
I think you should tell him
that he has killed you already.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.199
And hope that he believes you.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.600
Hey, Ben. Do you want a drink?

20:04.800 --> 20:11.000
The only other thing is
his personality. No longer integrated.

20:11.200 --> 20:17.000
In fact, his personality has split
into several distinct personalities.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.200
Which is why I tracked you down.

20:19.400 --> 20:23.199
To let you know that his personalities
are getting out tomorrow.

20:23.200 --> 20:28.400
The clinic can't let them all out
together. That's too dangerous.

20:30.200 --> 20:35.200
But all of Vic should be regrouped
by tomorrow evening.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.799
So, why don't you

20:38.800 --> 20:43.200
drop by the Rough-House
and welcome them all back home?

20:43.400 --> 20:46.600
Hey, I might.

20:50.800 --> 20:55.400
I hear. that you're banging Rita again.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.000
Rita Everly.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.599
Grace Everly.

21:01.600 --> 21:06.399
They're some women, Mick.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.800
Those Everly sisters.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.200
How is Grace handling all this stuff
with you and Rita?

21:16.400 --> 21:19.599
How is Rita handling you and Grace?

21:19.600 --> 21:22.199
Talk about sibling rivalry.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.200
You'll have to stop banging around.

21:25.400 --> 21:30.999
The thing is, if one of Vic's
personalities don't get you,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.400
one of those Everly sisters will.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.600
That is my Big Bang Theory.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.800
Nicholas Falco.
Have you heard anything about him?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.600
Nothing I believe.

21:56.800 --> 22:01.400
Here's the kicker
He has this crazy lung thing.

22:01.600 --> 22:06.400
It's incurable. He wants to make
the most of the time he has left.

22:08.200 --> 22:13.000
Let's get Holliday and Falco together.
Quickly.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.200
How quickly?

22:14.201 --> 22:19.000
In honor of Vic getting out today,
how about five minutes?

22:22.000 --> 22:26.999
Less than a year.
The guy is so young.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.799
That's a tough break Falco got.
He's only in his forties.

22:31.800 --> 22:39.399
Life is like that. It's trigger happy.

22:39.400 --> 22:44.000
And there but for the grace of God,
go the four of us.

22:49.400 --> 22:55.200
Some nitroglycerin.
For the angina.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.399
How are you gonna play Vic?
You need my help?

23:03.400 --> 23:06.000
Don't worry about me.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.200
I always land on my feet.

23:10.400 --> 23:15.400
Today you'll land on the coffee table.
Meet Nicholas Falco.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.400
Take your time.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.200
Now everything is in order

24:59.400 --> 25:02.800
It's all going according to plan.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
Time to send for Jacky Jackson
and the rest of the boys.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.800
I always knew it.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.400
As close as they were, I knew

25:12.600 --> 25:16.799
Vic and Mick would lock horns.
It's the nature of things.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.400
I knew that if I waited,
everything could be mine.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.400
I waited so long knowing what I knew.

25:23.600 --> 25:27.400
Knowing no one else knew what I knew.
And I knew that I knew that.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.000
I'm one all-knowing fucker

25:32.600 --> 25:39.599
Tonight is the first night
of the rest of my life.

25:39.600 --> 25:44.600
Vic's getting out
of the loony bin tonight

25:50.400 --> 25:52.800
Vic's car just pulled up.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.600
Vic.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.599
Wells, Davis, Jake.

26:01.600 --> 26:05.600
- How's the vagina?
- Angina.

26:15.600 --> 26:20.199
Rita. Vic will be in here any second.

26:20.200 --> 26:25.800
Would you be my date
at Mickey's memorial service?

26:26.000 --> 26:30.200
I wouldn't be caught dead with you
at his memorial service.

26:30.400 --> 26:36.199
I'm not like other guys.
I'm not tricky.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.600
I don't have a Grace up my sleeve.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.800
I understand the tangled web
of a woman's emotions.

26:51.600 --> 26:55.000
OK, boss, I'll see you inside.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.200
We'll be waiting for you.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.000
Welcome back.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.000
Thank you.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.400
Welcome home, Vic.

28:41.600 --> 28:46.000
We like to think of it now
as our home, too.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.200
From me and the boys.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.399
Thank you.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.600
Can you join us
for a round of Thorazine?

28:58.600 --> 29:02.800
Thorazine. That's funny.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.600
You're a funny guy.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.600
- Good to have you home, boss.
- Sleepy Joe.

29:42.400 --> 29:48.000
You gotta stay interested.
That's my philosophy. I'll help you.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
- How are you, Vic?
- Good. You?

29:54.200 --> 29:56.400
- I'm good, too.
- Good.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.200
- Send a thank you note to Jake Parker
- OK, Vic.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.200
Mickey Holliday.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.800
Hello, Mickey.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.600
Gabriella, please stay.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.000
- Care for a drink?
- No, thanks.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.599
- Something to eat?
- No thanks, Vic.

30:46.600 --> 30:51.400
Are you back with Rita? Or are you
just waiting to see how I play it?

30:51.600 --> 30:55.799
- Yeah, I'm back with Rita.
- And?

30:55.800 --> 30:59.800
It's over, Grace called it quits.

31:01.400 --> 31:05.600
- Any interest in seeing me?
- Well, she's scared.

31:08.200 --> 31:12.400
What have you heard
about my situation?

31:12.600 --> 31:16.200
I don't pay much attention
to what I hear secondhand.

31:16.400 --> 31:23.000
There's no reason to get long-winded
or fancy about this.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.600
I'm a loony.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.399
Clinically.

31:29.400 --> 31:36.200
But we think we found some ways
to keep it under control.

31:36.400 --> 31:41.600
Tell her, it was the chemistry
that made it impossible to be with me.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.800
Tell her,
that I'm sorry about certain things.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.400
I'll tell her

32:00.400 --> 32:02.000
So...

32:04.000 --> 32:08.399
- How do you read Jake Parker
- He smells weakness.

32:08.400 --> 32:12.399
He's gonna move in on that
unless you do something.

32:12.400 --> 32:17.399
- Why don't you do something about it?
- OK.

32:17.400 --> 32:22.200
And soon. Before they really dig in.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.600
When did he show up
with Davis and Wells?

32:25.800 --> 32:29.000
Tonight was the first time
I've seen them together

32:29.200 --> 32:33.600
- He must be crazy to come after me.
- Jacky Jackson is the craziest.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.000
Don't let Jake get his crew in town.

32:36.200 --> 32:40.399
Don't wait until it gets too crazy
for you to handle.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.999
Holliday calls all the shots
on Jake Parker

32:44.000 --> 32:46.800
- No problem.
- God...

32:48.600 --> 32:50.400
Ben?

32:50.600 --> 32:54.199
- Understand?
- Fuck that, Vic.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.200
- That's how it's gotta be. My way.
- Oh, no.

32:57.400 --> 33:01.199
- Yeah, my way.
- Oh, no.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.200
Yeah.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.800
OK.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.400
Be nice to Ben,
but if he gives you any trouble...

33:12.600 --> 33:14.800
shoot him.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
All right.

33:17.001 --> 33:22.200
There but for the grace
of Vic and Mick, go you.

33:22.400 --> 33:27.600
Clean up the craziness for me, Mickey.
Get the balance back.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.600
And I want Grace coming through this
in one piece.

33:33.800 --> 33:38.200
Keep her out of sight
until things are back to normal.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.800
More bullshit.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.200
- Consider yourself on the payroll.
- Consider this a freebie.

33:46.400 --> 33:50.800
But nobody lays a finger
on Jules Flamingo.

33:54.600 --> 33:59.399
You'll have to excuse me.
Lot of running around to do tonight.

33:59.400 --> 34:03.600
I've been away from the shooting match
for too long.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.800
Is she still pregnant?

34:09.400 --> 34:10.600
Yeah.

34:15.199 --> 34:19.199
I'm giving a homecoming party
for myself tomorrow.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.600
You're all invited.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.800
Hi, Holliday.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.999
Can't say I'm tickled to see you alive,
but I had a contingency plan.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.399
How about Falco and you at the'D'
in half an hour? Just for fun.

35:16.400 --> 35:21.200
- I told you, talk to me in a year
- You'll be there.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.400
Falco killed Jules Flamingo.

35:31.800 --> 35:36.200
I've heard a lot about Nicholas Falco
over the last few days.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.600
He's quick on the trigger
Very quick.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.600
Quicker than Mick.

35:41.800 --> 35:45.199
Nick's quicker than Mick
and Mick isn't as quick as Nick.

35:45.200 --> 35:49.400
I pick Nick over Mick,
which is not so good for Vic.

35:49.600 --> 35:54.600
Is Grace pregnant by Mick or Vic?

35:56.400 --> 36:01.000
Mick, if you are the daddy,

36:01.200 --> 36:04.600
can we sell tickets
for when you tell Rita?

36:05.600 --> 36:08.200
Be at the 'D' in 20 minutes.

36:09.800 --> 36:14.000
- Pregnant? Who is the...?
- Vic's the father

36:14.200 --> 36:17.799
I can't explain this
without explaining all of it.

36:17.800 --> 36:23.400
And you're kind of touchy when
it comes to stuff about your sister

36:23.600 --> 36:29.000
- I figured this was the best way.
- For you, maybe. Not for me.

36:33.600 --> 36:39.200
I thought this time around
maybe we wouldn't bullshit each other

36:43.200 --> 36:45.800
What else are you holding back?

36:48.400 --> 36:52.600
Jake said
that Falco killed Jules Flamingo

36:52.800 --> 36:54.200
Holliday?

36:55.400 --> 36:58.400
This is Nicholas Falco.

36:58.600 --> 37:02.600
Thanks to him,
I'm now using Jules as a giant coaster

37:05.400 --> 37:08.200
Please, sit down.

37:11.200 --> 37:17.400
- So, who you got coming?
- Ben London.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
You and Ben should really hit it off.

37:24.200 --> 37:28.200
- Just a feeling.
- Falco and I worked up a plan.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.200
You wanna hear, how you're gonna die?

37:32.200 --> 37:35.400
First I'm gonna shoot you
in the stomach.

37:35.600 --> 37:41.999
Then I'm gonna shatter your shin bones.
That's so you don't go nowhere.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.399
That's the first part.

37:44.400 --> 37:50.200
Second part, Jake and me are gonna
sit back and have a drink,

37:50.400 --> 37:53.200
and watch you die real slow.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.800
And when you're almost dead...

37:58.600 --> 38:02.399
I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.600
I see.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.200
Nicholas...

38:11.800 --> 38:15.999
Geez, what's that second part
of the first part?

38:16.000 --> 38:19.799
I don't get it. You're plugging me
in the belly,

38:19.800 --> 38:23.600
but then you're gonna waste
two more shots

38:23.800 --> 38:29.400
with this
shattering of the shin shit?

38:30.600 --> 38:36.200
Wouldn't it be better to bury
a bunch of bullets in my belly,

38:36.400 --> 38:42.200
skip the second part of the first part,
go into the first of the second part,

38:42.400 --> 38:45.999
you know, the bit with the booze,

38:46.000 --> 38:49.800
and then the blowing out
of the brains bullshit.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.400
To be honest with you,
it just seems so highfalutin for me.

38:55.600 --> 39:01.400
My way is simpler. I shoot you
in the forehead and go home.

39:04.200 --> 39:09.400
Sorry I'm late.
Hey, Nick. I'm Ben.

39:09.600 --> 39:13.400
I hear, you don't have to do
any Christmas shopping next year

39:13.600 --> 39:18.000
I hear, you got a date
with Jimmy the Grave Digger

39:18.200 --> 39:20.599
The world is an ungracious place.

39:20.600 --> 39:26.199
You gotta look at it in a positive way.
We're all gonna die.

39:26.200 --> 39:32.399
You gotta look at it like
you're beating us to the finish line.

39:32.400 --> 39:35.800
You are coming first in death.

39:37.600 --> 39:40.799
You know what my philosophy of life is?

39:40.800 --> 39:44.399
Nobody knows beans, but Ben.

39:44.400 --> 39:47.000
It's kinda Zen.

39:47.200 --> 39:51.199
Zen by way of Ben. Ben Zen.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.399
I'm a practicing Ben Buddhist.

39:54.400 --> 39:58.800
In certain circles I'm known
as "Bubba" Ben London.

40:04.200 --> 40:08.400
You're not so hot
on the chit-chat, Nick.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.800
Is he already dead?

40:53.600 --> 40:57.600
I think he's dead,
but with him it's kinda hard to tell.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.399
All those stories.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.600
This guy was a big, fat nothing.

41:05.600 --> 41:10.600
What do you figure is better
over the long haul?

41:10.800 --> 41:13.600
Cunning or balls?

41:16.800 --> 41:17.999
A healthy mix.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
Jake was cunning,
but outfoxed himself.

41:21.200 --> 41:26.200
In my opinion,
he had a really crappy Grand Design.

41:56.800 --> 42:01.000
Angina. There's nothing wrong
with this guy's heart.

42:03.800 --> 42:07.200
Nitroglycerin, my ass.
These are Tic Tacs.

42:07.400 --> 42:12.400
What are we gonna tell Wells and Davis?
That he died of bad breath?

42:28.200 --> 42:31.600
Oh yeah, that's "Wacky" Jacky Jackson.

42:31.800 --> 42:36.999
It's about time the rest of Jake's crew
came out of the woodwork.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.400
Let me fuck with them for a while.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.200
Hello, boys.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.800
Tic Tac, anybody?

43:02.400 --> 43:05.000
Jake's dead.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.800
Died of cirrhosis halitosis.

43:09.800 --> 43:12.000
Sit down.

43:13.200 --> 43:18.200
Not now. Those two guys
got too many pals here.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.200
We'll do it...

43:23.200 --> 43:24.800
tomorrow.

43:27.800 --> 43:31.000
Tomorrow at Vic's party.

43:33.400 --> 43:40.000
Gottlieb and his gravedigger want you.

43:46.400 --> 43:51.400
Everybody wilNbe at Vic's party
It's gonna be mad dog time

43:51.600 --> 43:54.600
Do you think
Vic wants Grace dead, Mickey?

43:58.200 --> 44:01.599
That's a tough one to call.

44:01.600 --> 44:06.800
But I gotta stick around to find out.

44:08.600 --> 44:10.200
I...

44:12.000 --> 44:16.200
You know, I went dead inside

44:16.400 --> 44:20.600
a while back
and she helped pull me out of it.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.600
So, I owe her

44:27.800 --> 44:32.400
Before Grace disappeared,
she said she was still nuts for Vic.

44:32.600 --> 44:38.800
She wants to get back together with him
if everything is right with his head.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.800
I promised I wouldn't kill him
unless he backed me into a corner

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
Are you torching for her, Mickey?

44:58.000 --> 44:59.600
No.

45:00.400 --> 45:04.999
If you're bullshitting me
about any of it,

45:05.000 --> 45:08.600
I'll slit your throat
from ear to ear

45:10.200 --> 45:12.400
Come here.

46:30.600 --> 46:35.000
That's Jake's RSVP to Vic's party.

46:59.200 --> 47:02.200
I'm gonna go get you something to eat.

47:07.200 --> 47:09.600
Don't dawdle, Mickey.

47:24.400 --> 47:26.400
Mickey.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.200
Mickey.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.400
I...

47:37.000 --> 47:39.800
I thought you should know:

47:40.000 --> 47:44.399
Sleepy Joe got his head
full of holes last night.

47:44.400 --> 47:48.600
He got his brains blown out.
In fact, he's dead.

48:00.400 --> 48:03.799
You don't know the size
of someone's brain,

48:03.800 --> 48:07.000
until you've swept it up
off the carpet.

48:07.200 --> 48:13.199
Let me tell you,
Sleepy Joe had quite a brain.

48:13.200 --> 48:18.400
Let's face it, Mick.
Vic didn't believe you last night.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.000
Tic Tac?

48:24.400 --> 48:26.800
Thank you, Ben London.

48:30.400 --> 48:32.600
Rita, how are you?

48:34.000 --> 48:38.600
Are you coming to Vic's party?
It's gonna be some wing-ding.

48:38.800 --> 48:43.200
Be sure to bring Mick's
dental charts for identification.

48:43.400 --> 48:46.800
Tonight we'll get to see
each other' s cards.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
And the way I figure it is this:

48:50.200 --> 48:55.199
Mick is bluffing.
Vic isn't playing with a full deck.

48:55.200 --> 48:59.000
And I get to take home
the whole kitty, Rita.

49:02.200 --> 49:04.800
See you at Vic's party tonight.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.200
Rita.

49:31.400 --> 49:35.399
- Glad you made it. You look beautiful.
- Thanks, Vic.

49:35.400 --> 49:40.400
Ladies and gentlemen. Folks.

49:41.200 --> 49:43.800
And Vic.

49:50.200 --> 49:54.199
I cooked up a little something.

49:54.200 --> 49:58.400
It's kind of my way of saying:

49:58.600 --> 50:01.000
"Welcome home, Vic."

50:02.600 --> 50:07.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Danny Marks!

50:17.800 --> 50:20.399
Take it away.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.400
Vic, this is for you.

50:24.600 --> 50:29.600
And now, the end is near.

50:29.800 --> 50:35.600
And so I face the final curtain

50:36.800 --> 50:39.400
My friends

50:39.600 --> 50:42.600
I'll say it clear.

50:42.800 --> 50:45.600
I'll state my case

50:45.800 --> 50:48.600
Of which I'm certain

50:48.800 --> 50:54.599
He lived a life that's full

50:54.600 --> 50:58.399
He traveled each

50:58.400 --> 51:02.000
And every highway

51:02.200 --> 51:06.600
But more, much more than this

51:06.800 --> 51:09.200
Vic did it Vic's way

51:11.400 --> 51:15.199
He did it his way

51:15.200 --> 51:18.599
Regrets, he had a few

51:18.600 --> 51:23.200
- Introducing Grace to Mickey. Kidding.
- But then again

51:23.400 --> 51:26.600
Too few to mention

51:27.600 --> 51:31.800
He did what he had to do

51:32.800 --> 51:35.200
And he saw it through

51:37.200 --> 51:38.200
Without exemption

51:38.400 --> 51:42.400
- You're a paranoid schizophrenic, Vic.
- He planned

51:42.600 --> 51:46.000
Each chartered course

51:46.200 --> 51:51.800
Each careful step along the byway

51:53.000 --> 51:57.399
But more, much more than this

51:57.400 --> 52:01.399
Vic's gonna do it Ben's way

52:01.400 --> 52:04.600
He did it his way

52:05.800 --> 52:08.200
- He loved
- Not lately.

52:08.400 --> 52:11.200
He laughed, he cried

52:11.400 --> 52:17.200
He's had his fill, his share of losing

52:17.400 --> 52:18.800
A lot of that lately.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.200
But now, as tears subside

52:24.400 --> 52:29.000
He finds it all so amusing

52:29.200 --> 52:31.600
Danny, is he finding it amusing?

52:33.200 --> 52:36.399
To think he did all that

52:36.400 --> 52:39.600
And may I say

52:39.800 --> 52:43.199
Not in a shy way

52:43.200 --> 52:45.000
Oh, no

52:46.000 --> 52:48.800
Oh no, not me

52:49.800 --> 52:53.200
Ben did it Ben's way

52:55.800 --> 52:59.600
For what is a man?
What has he got?

52:59.800 --> 53:04.200
If not himself

53:04.400 --> 53:07.000
Then he has not

53:07.200 --> 53:10.399
To say the things

53:10.400 --> 53:13.000
He truly feels

53:14.200 --> 53:20.400
And not the words of one who kneels

53:20.600 --> 53:26.000
The record shows
I took the blows

53:26.200 --> 53:33.400
And did it my way

53:34.000 --> 53:35.400
Yeah!

53:39.800 --> 53:41.600
Oh, yeah.

53:44.200 --> 53:47.200
Danny, you're through in show business.

53:50.000 --> 53:56.200
This is the last time
I ever share a stage with anyone.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.800
From now on, I'm doing a single.

54:01.800 --> 54:05.000
I thought it was impossible,

54:05.200 --> 54:09.600
but you really brought
something fresh to that song.

54:11.200 --> 54:15.000
For my money,
this is the definitive version.

54:16.200 --> 54:20.800
Is that you talking, Vic?
Or is it the medication?

54:26.200 --> 54:28.200
Thank you all for coming.

54:40.200 --> 54:43.000
Rita, nice of you to drop by.

54:44.400 --> 54:46.000
Holliday...

54:48.200 --> 54:50.600
You stay.

54:56.000 --> 55:01.800
Vic, I like how you handled that.
Very nice.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.400
You certainly had grace under pressure.

55:05.600 --> 55:08.200
Personally I prefer Grace under me.

55:08.400 --> 55:13.400
Vic, what would you say is best
over the long haul?

55:13.600 --> 55:16.200
Balls or grace?

55:17.400 --> 55:18.600
A healthy mix.

55:18.800 --> 55:22.200
I think too much grace makes you loony.

55:22.400 --> 55:25.400
It triggers craziness.

55:25.600 --> 55:29.600
Think of the craziness
your craziness has triggered.

55:29.800 --> 55:33.399
Your girlfriend left you.
Mick hooked up with her

55:33.400 --> 55:35.199
You got more crazy.

55:35.200 --> 55:38.800
That made me conclude
that you don't know shit.

55:39.000 --> 55:45.199
Ben, go home.
Pack your bags and leave town.

55:45.200 --> 55:49.800
First of all,
nobody tells me what to do.

55:57.800 --> 56:03.600
Ben, hop home, pack your bags
and leave town.

56:03.800 --> 56:07.400
I'll hop home
when I'm fucking good and ready.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.600
I judge a man by the way he dies.

56:14.800 --> 56:17.199
Your life was one note.

56:17.200 --> 56:21.200
Ben, you can't shoot any better
than you can sing.

56:21.400 --> 56:26.799
Now put the gun away, roll home,
pack your bags and leave town.

56:26.800 --> 56:30.800
I am "Bubba" Ben London.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.200
Mickey, don't you get it yet?

56:34.400 --> 56:39.399
Vic is using you to clean up
the craziness and then

56:39.400 --> 56:41.800
he's gonna clean you up.

56:53.400 --> 56:55.400
Everything under control?

57:00.600 --> 57:02.600
Who the hell are you?

57:04.600 --> 57:06.400
Nicholas Falco.

57:06.600 --> 57:09.999
Mickey, didn't we kill him already?

57:10.000 --> 57:15.800
The real Nicholas Falco.
There's never been anybody like him.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.199
Best trigger man I've ever seen.

57:19.200 --> 57:20.400
Bar none.

57:20.600 --> 57:23.200
You mean...

57:23.400 --> 57:25.999
we killed...

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
a phony Falco?

57:28.200 --> 57:31.600
We killed a pseudo Nick?

57:31.800 --> 57:34.600
You mean Jake pulled a Nick trick?

58:23.600 --> 58:27.600
It's all related.

58:28.800 --> 58:31.399
All oneness.

58:31.400 --> 58:33.400
Mick...

58:33.600 --> 58:35.600
Vic...

58:35.800 --> 58:38.200
Nick.

58:38.400 --> 58:41.800
Life is beautiful.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.799
Brutal.

58:44.800 --> 58:47.799
Mystical.

58:47.800 --> 58:49.800
Cockamamie.

58:57.000 --> 59:03.400
I am "Brass Balls" Ben London.

59:03.600 --> 59:07.400
Oh, what a pair of balls had I.

59:20.200 --> 59:25.400
You got a couple of minutes?
I wanna show you something.

59:52.000 --> 59:57.000
- Gabriella.
- Mickey. Meet Nicky.

59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.399
Mick, take a look at my new chairs.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.999
- Oh, nice.
- I picked them up today.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.599
Really?

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.000
Very, very relaxing.

01:00:07.001 --> 01:00:09.399
Very, very relaxing.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.200
- Right, Nick?
- Hell, yeah.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.800
You gotta sit down in one of these
to appreciate it.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.200
Come on, take a load off.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.600
What's all this?
Oh yeah, it's comfy.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.200
Comfy?
That's what Wells and Davis said.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.200
- They were here?
- Yeah, tonight.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.199
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.799
I asked Nicholas
to show them my new furniture.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.199
They flipped.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.999
Well, sure.
It's good quality merchandise.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.999
- I suppose you heard that Nicholas...
- Oh, Vic.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I never pay attention
to what I just hear

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:13.199
Well, anyway.
Nicholas is fit as a fiddle.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:17.000
He'll be working with me
for a long time.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.400
Maybe so.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.200
One.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.000
One.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Two.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.799
Three.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.400
Three.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.400
Are we gonna throw the guns
at each other

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.800
Show me.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.000
Vic. Grace wants to see you, Vic.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.600
This bullet dropping shit.
That's fun stuff.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:26.200
Hey, Mickey.
I could be way off on this,

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.800
but I think I spotted your weakness.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.400
Yes, yes.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.400
I could be wrong, but...

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.000
Jackson. "Wacky" Jacky.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.000
Should I run down
and pick up those bullets?

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.599
- Hi, Mickey.
- I could kick myself.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.400
Hi, Mickey.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.399
What happened to Ben?

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.400
He was rehearsing a one-man show.
It closed.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.800
That's too bad. I liked Ben.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.600
He had a fresh breath.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.600
Vic, I hear, you're having
a lollapalooza of a depression.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.400
I hear, you're feeling blue.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.599
I hear, that you're having a,
how do you call it... a bad day.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.600
That could last the rest of your life.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.200
- Wanna hear my philosophy of life?
- I really would.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:00.599
I'd like nothing better
but Mickey and I are very busy.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:06.600
- Would you like to recommend the book?
- It's too short to be in a book.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:12.600
I think philosophies should be short.
My philosophy is:

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.000
I don't give a fuck.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:22.200
- That's a little over my head.
- Doesn't bother me.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.400
Because I don't give a fuck.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.399
When it comes to not giving a fuck,

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.399
you guys are just dabblers.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:45.000
Have you ever heard of a guy
named Nicholas Falco?

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.400
Can we talk a minute?

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.400
Maybe he should have given a fuck.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.800
A short philosophy
isn't necessarily the best.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.199
Sometimes it pays
to shop around for one.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.999
I think they locked
into their philosophy too quick.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.200
An Eastern philosophy
would have been good for them.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:35.400
I don't know. Jackson is not the type
to search for himself.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.600
So...

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
What do you think of the new gent?

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.599
Falco? He's a humdinger

01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.199
He's so quirky and interesting.
I love those sunglasses.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:05.000
I love the way he left the gun behind.
That was good.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:09.800
And that voice. Spooky.
Spooky voice.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.800
I'd say very good.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.400
Maybe I finally found
someone better than you.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.799
Well, Vic...

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.400
you found somebody quicker, but...

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.599
pretty soon you won't have
anyone to talk to but him.

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:35.600
Everyone else will be in Gottlieb's
Mortuary with Jimmy the Grave Digger

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.000
Then you'll be
talking to yourself again.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:45.600
- Did you tell Grace everything I said?
- Yeah.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.399
- About the imbalance triggering the...
- Yeah.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:53.600
- And that I was sorry about...
- Yeah.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.400
You didn't tell her anything, did you?

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.600
No, I didn't.
Because I don't know where she is.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.200
She disappeared.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.200
OK...

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:38.600
Oh, so I got a message.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.800
Midnight tomorrow at Grace's office.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.200
But I'm not sure it was from her

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.600
Rough night, huh?

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.800
It's about to get rougher

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.200
- I may need you tomorrow night.
- OK.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:41.800
Vic may have located Grace.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.399
It's all coming to a head.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.399
Mickey?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.400
Let's try and make it work
between us this time, please.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.800
Come here.

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.600
What's your philosophy of life?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.800
Laughs.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.199
Laughs are deep in your blood too, Vic.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.799
There's a lot to laughter as an elixir

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:44.600
It's a healer, You feel blue, right?
I'm feeling down, but...

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.800
I'm better

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.200
I hope we don't crash.
Don't you, Vic?

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.600
Wanna hear my fucking philosophy?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:13.000
To hell with goddamn everything.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.800
You gotta tell me
if Grace shows tomorrow night.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Do you wanna kill her
or do you want me to kill her

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:35.199
It's time to make arrangements with
Gottlieb and Jimmy the Grave Digger

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.800
It's goddamn time

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.400
I'm gonna need you later tonight.
Sweetie.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.600
Vic's getting out today?

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.000
Grace, Vic got out two days ago.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:41.000
He wasn't ready for you. I'm still
not sure if he's ready, but...

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.000
if you wanna take a chance...

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.599
He says he has something
for the balance.

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.199
And to keep things under control.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.200
Now, that may be true,
but it may not be true.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.800
In which case,
he'll be dancing on our graves.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:20.200
I've been seeing Rita
over the last few nights.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:25.800
You've been seeing Rita at night,
and me in the day?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.799
Yes.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:34.399
Rita is gonna kill you. Oh, yeah.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.000
Do you have a death wish?

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.000
I know.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.800
How long did you think
you'd get away with this?

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.600
I was hoping forever

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
A little heaven on earth.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.200
Yes.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.400
- I'm gonna miss you, Mickey.
- Sweetheart.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:25.200
- Do you have a plan for tonight?
- Yeah.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.000
Do you think Vic's got a plan?

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.800
Yeah.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.200
Gottlieb.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.800
Hello.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.800
Hey, Vic.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.200
Jimmy the Grave Digger
is right on time.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.600
Come on.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.800
Sell me your motherfucking heart.
It's dead.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.400
How are you, Vic?

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.400
Better

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.999
Nick Falco. Grace Everly.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.200
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Thank you.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.400
Vic gave me the whole works.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.599
He's crazy about me.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.800
- I told Mick to tell you some things.
- He told me.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.600
Hello, Rita.

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.400
Hello, Grace.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:36.400
- Rita Everly, Nick Falco.
- I've heard a lot about you.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.399
Let's get everything out in the open.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:50.199
It's healthier

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:55.600
Vic, you want to kill Mickey.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.999
And you wanna kill me too.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.200
Rita, it's been so long, you probably
forgot why you wanna kill me.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.799
So I'm gonna give you
some fresh reasons.

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.000
I owe Mickey a lot.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.199
I kinda went dead inside a while ago,

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.600
and he helped pull me out of it.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:23.199
- Bullshitter
- He was with you the past four nights.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.400
But you don't know that
he's been with me these last four days.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.400
One more thing, Rita.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.400
Mickey's crazy about you.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.800
Do you know what I wish?

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.199
I wish the two of you would go dead.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.800
On the outside, goddamn it.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.400
This truth shit is fun.
Anyone else have something to share?

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.200
How am I doing, Mickey?

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.200
Vic, I'm nuts for you.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.799
And I'm gonna have your child.
I want us back together

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.200
We're kind of a healthy mix.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.200
You think about that.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.400
I know it's your favorite game.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.599
Mickey, I'm quicker than you.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.600
Yeah, I know, but...

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.999
you only have one bullet.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
You only have one bullet.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.400
No, I got another bullet tucked away.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:53.600
I think I've got
a bullet tucked away, too.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.599
You see, I'd bet my life
that you don't have one tucked away.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:07.599
Bad bet for you, Holliday.
You missed the truth.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:12.400
Vic ain't interested.
He doesn't want to live anymore.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.800
It was triggered
by a goddamn profound ennui.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.599
Not that again.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:28.199
Since I've known him, he's gone
through that like half a dozen times.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:31.199
This is the last time.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:35.199
After I finish killing off
you and Grace...

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.200
Vic hired me to kill...

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.400
Vic.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:48.000
Let me make this real simple for you.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.800
First of all, I'm making a bet.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000
That Vic is not
going to throw it all away.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:59.000
Grace triggered happiness in him once.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:03.800
I'm betting he's coming back
for more, because she is...

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.400
just what the doctor ordered.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.400
But no matter how it all goes down...

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.600
I think I'm covered.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:24.400
Mickey, I spotted your weakness again.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.400
You care.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:42.000
Mickey, I think
I'm much better covered than you.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.800
Show me.

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.200
You son of a bitch!

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:23.800
Nobody two-times me two times.
You bullshitting bastard.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.999
I'm gonna shoot the shit out of you.
You are such a dick, Mick!

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.999
I am so sick
of this Vic, Nick, Mick shit.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.600
Yick, yick, yick.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I'm running out of people to kill me.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:44.400
Don't look at me.
I just ran out of bullets.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.200
Ben would have wanted it this way.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.600
But then again, fuck Ben.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.400
Looks like it's gonna be the long haul.
No miracle cures.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.799
Do you wanna...

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:43.000
help me stay interested?

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.800
Welcome home, Vic.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.999
That was some smack you gave me.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.599
You told me to smack you,
leave the purse and storm out.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.200
Yeah, well.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.799
I don't recall telling you to storm
back in pointing another gun

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:57.599
right at my face
and having a conniption fit.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:02.799
You two-timed me two times.
Vic, Nick, Mick. Yick, yick.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:09.000
- What was all that?
- I made up that part all by myself.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.599
Nice touch.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:16.599
Now, just who went dead on the inside
and who pulled who out?

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.599
She went, I pulled.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.400
Did you say anything in the last
five days that wasn't bullshit?

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:28.799
- No, it was all bullshit.
- Oh, bullshit.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:34.800
Except for the part about me
being glad that we're back together

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.400
Bullshit that wasn't bullshit.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.200
Oh baby, come here.

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:55.600
Let's go home, crack open a little
champagne, have some laughs.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.800
Sounds to me
like the perfect way to play it.
