Subtitles: LuÃ­s Filipe Bernardes

00:13.500 --> 00:14.600
I know.

00:14.601 --> 00:16.801
I'm not what you expected.

00:18.002 --> 00:20.602
Honestly, I'm not what I expected either.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.003
But what my mother expected.

00:23.004 --> 00:25.604
You could say I'm unexpected all around.

00:26.605 --> 00:30.105
I install shower doors.
Glass ones.

00:30.106 --> 00:33.006
On the side I paint pets.

00:33.007 --> 00:36.007
Not paint the pets, I do portraits of pets.

00:36.508 --> 00:38.008
You figure, wait a minute.

00:38.009 --> 00:43.509
Shower doors probably means he gets
a lot of lonely housewives coming on to him.

00:43.510 --> 00:46.210
Maybe an average looking,
but with a friendly manner

00:46.211 --> 00:49.611
and an optimistic outlook of life,
then I can say yes.

00:49.612 --> 00:51.412
It happens sometimes.

00:52.413 --> 00:54.113
Or at least once.

00:54.114 --> 00:56.414
With a good-looking lady, that is.

00:56.415 --> 00:59.500
It happened another time,
but I rather not think about that.

00:59.501 --> 01:00.501
Whew!

01:00.502 --> 01:02.702
Anyway, I was finishing the installation

01:02.703 --> 01:04.403
when she walked in.

01:05.804 --> 01:09.204
Contrary to popular belief...

01:09.505 --> 01:10.705
Beg your pardon?

01:10.706 --> 01:14.106
Kittens love taking showers.

01:15.007 --> 01:17.007
contrary to popular belief.

01:17.008 --> 01:18.308
Yeah?

01:19.409 --> 01:23.399
Do you mind if I try out the shower
and make sure it doesn't have a leak?

01:23.400 --> 01:25.100
The shower's not gonna leak.

01:25.001 --> 01:26.301
No...

01:26.302 --> 01:28.702
My work is guaranteed.

01:32.703 --> 01:33.803
Oh!

01:33.804 --> 01:34.804
Oh.

01:36.005 --> 01:37.505
Yes.

01:37.506 --> 01:38.506
Oh.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.607
I hate awkward silences.

01:47.008 --> 01:48.308
I know what you mean.

01:48.309 --> 01:53.009
You are a very difficult man to read,

01:53.010 --> 01:54.510
Eugene.

01:54.511 --> 01:55.511
Am I?

01:55.512 --> 01:57.722
Because 'Oh' could mean several things.

01:57.723 --> 02:01.323
It could be an encouraging
ohhh...

02:01.324 --> 02:06.224
Or it could be an
'Oh, I play for the opposite team.'

02:07.325 --> 02:09.725
Is that what you think?
I hope not.

02:11.426 --> 02:12.826
Oh, what about your husband?

02:13.727 --> 02:15.727
I don't want to talk about him.

02:15.728 --> 02:19.028
But he's not gonna walk in now
while you're taking a shower?

02:19.029 --> 02:23.209
No, no, lately he comes home late
if he comes home at all.

02:23.210 --> 02:26.010
It's a heavy workload at work, he says.

02:26.011 --> 02:29.511
She was a little redundant.
I noticed that right away.

02:29.512 --> 02:31.612
But I don't mind that in a woman.

02:32.713 --> 02:33.913
You know?

02:33.914 --> 02:36.214
I know, times are tough.

02:36.215 --> 02:39.005
Do you wanna keep talking about him?

02:39.006 --> 02:40.006
Or...

02:40.007 --> 02:43.257
do wanna watch me take a shower?

02:43.258 --> 02:44.850
As you can probably imagine,

02:44.851 --> 02:48.951
I had 200% of zero interest
in talking about her husband.

02:48.952 --> 02:52.352
I just wanted to make sure it wasn't
some kind of kinky ruse

02:52.353 --> 02:55.653
where he was gonna come busting in
with a baseball bat

02:55.654 --> 02:58.354
and I end up gagging in some cellar.

02:58.355 --> 03:00.355
I'd rather watch you take a shower.

03:01.156 --> 03:02.156
Great!

03:09.557 --> 03:12.357
I've never showered in front of someone else.

03:15.458 --> 03:16.858
I could turn around.

03:20.059 --> 03:22.259
You're a real gentleman, aren't you?

03:25.160 --> 03:27.300
I was raised by a single mom, so...

03:27.301 --> 03:30.401
she made sure I respected women.

03:30.802 --> 03:35.002
It's...it's not easy for you guys
with us calling the shots

03:35.003 --> 03:37.303
or thinking we do anyway...

03:38.004 --> 03:40.004
and all we do is mess things up.

03:40.805 --> 03:43.305
All you guys want is a little attention.
Somebody who...

03:43.306 --> 03:47.206
holds your hand during dinner and
listens...

03:47.207 --> 03:48.207
you know,

03:48.908 --> 03:51.008
says thank you

03:51.009 --> 03:52.809
and tells you your hair looks nice.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.410
I knew the holding hands bit was overkill.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.611
At least I didn't offer to give her a massage.

03:59.612 --> 04:03.702
The damage was done.
She was drop dead gorgeous.

04:03.703 --> 04:06.973
All that oxygen pumping in and out of her lungs.

04:06.974 --> 04:08.804
I didn't ask for this, you know?

04:08.805 --> 04:12.800
The first weekend we got together
he took me on a trip to Cabo.

04:12.801 --> 04:15.201
And I found out later he had conned his way

04:15.202 --> 04:17.202
into getting an upgrade using someone else's name,

04:17.202 --> 04:20.803
which at the time I thought was reckless
and cute.

04:22.103 --> 04:26.004
Maybe it was the heat or the ceviche
that went to my head

04:26.005 --> 04:29.705
but somehow I had nineteen orgasms.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.806
From eating ceviche?

04:32.807 --> 04:34.807
With him in the room.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.500
And I just thought, Holy Moly, you know...

04:38.701 --> 04:40.800
This is the one.
I guess.

04:40.801 --> 04:42.800
He knows how to make me feel.

04:43.201 --> 04:45.501
I had to listen to my body.

04:46.002 --> 04:49.102
I think there are a lot of guys
who can listen to your body.

04:50.003 --> 04:52.703
You're sweet.
No, no, I mean...

04:52.704 --> 04:57.304
your body really speaks loud and clear.

04:57.305 --> 04:59.605
You think I'm vulgar?

04:59.606 --> 05:02.496
No, no, I don't...
Not at all.

05:02.497 --> 05:05.007
I think you're articulate.

05:05.008 --> 05:08.408
Physically, is what I'm saying.
You think I'm fat.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.209
My mother has gotten so fat.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.510
No, no, you're not at all fat.

05:14.511 --> 05:16.601
Let's talk about
what you were talking about before.

05:16.602 --> 05:18.702
No, I don't wanna talk about him.

05:19.203 --> 05:20.303
Me either.

05:20.304 --> 05:23.404
No, words just get in the way of emotions.

05:23.405 --> 05:24.705
Yeah.
Yes.

05:24.706 --> 05:25.706
Yeah.

05:26.907 --> 05:30.307
But somehow I feel I can really talk to you.

05:30.308 --> 05:32.200
And so she talked...

05:32.401 --> 05:34.001
and talked.

05:34.002 --> 05:37.102
I knew I was in trouble when I noticed
my right leg was asleep

05:37.103 --> 05:40.903
and I started wondering how late
I was gonna be for my next appointment.

05:40.904 --> 05:45.004
It was clear this woman was in no emotional state
to throw herself at me.

05:45.005 --> 05:49.605
Plus the nineteen orgasms given to her
by her husband were looming over me

05:49.606 --> 05:50.806
like a monster.

05:50.807 --> 05:54.007
...and that Russian tramp had hypnotized him...

05:54.008 --> 05:57.008
and he had blown all of the missing cash on her.

05:57.009 --> 05:58.809
How many days?
Excuse me?

05:58.810 --> 06:00.200
How many days were you in Cabo?

06:00.801 --> 06:03.001
Two, why?

06:03.002 --> 06:04.102
No reason.

06:04.103 --> 06:07.003
Oh, listen to me!

06:07.204 --> 06:10.604
Saying I don't want to talk about him
and then going on, and on, and on about him.

06:10.605 --> 06:13.305
You must think I am such a mess.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.166
No...
Yes, you do.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.300
No, I don't.

06:16.301 --> 06:17.601
Cause what I want...

06:18.002 --> 06:19.902
Check that, no, no, no...

06:19.903 --> 06:21.803
what I need...

06:21.804 --> 06:23.904
I need for you to ravage me.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.605
Can you do that for me?

06:25.606 --> 06:28.106
Even if I look like I'm not enjoying myself?

06:28.107 --> 06:31.907
Can you just have your way with me
like some sort of savage?

06:32.908 --> 06:34.908
It's okay, it's okay.

06:36.309 --> 06:37.409
It's okay.

06:42.710 --> 06:46.400
I love him so much...
We shouldn't do this.

06:46.401 --> 06:50.301
He's a great guy. You would get along.
You would like each other.

06:50.302 --> 06:53.702
I'm sure we'd love each other.
I am the worst person in the world.

06:53.703 --> 06:57.103
I have no right to drag you into this.
I'm so sorry.

06:57.104 --> 06:59.404
So anyway, that happens once in a while.

06:59.405 --> 07:01.005
But for the most part...

07:01.406 --> 07:05.506
shower door installation is not consonant
with seduction.

07:05.999 --> 07:10.307
Which makes the tale I'm about to tell you
all the more peculiar.

07:25.808 --> 07:28.608
Oh, I didn't know you had company.

07:29.009 --> 07:30.209
Who?

07:30.210 --> 07:32.300
I don't know. I'm Sevilla.

07:32.301 --> 07:35.001
Oh, Eugene Portland.

07:35.502 --> 07:37.102
At your service.

07:37.103 --> 07:38.703
Is that your dog?

07:39.604 --> 07:41.704
No, that's a er...

07:41.705 --> 07:44.295
a painting,
it was commissioned by a lady and...

07:44.296 --> 07:46.006
Can I help you?

07:46.007 --> 07:48.500
This is not room 43.

07:49.501 --> 07:51.400
No, it's room 34.

07:52.701 --> 07:55.201
I have a condition.
What kind of condition?

07:55.202 --> 07:56.602
A dyslexic condition.

07:56.603 --> 07:58.603
I'm sorry to bother you.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.304
I'm late for an appointment.

08:01.605 --> 08:03.905
No bother at all.
Come back any time.

08:05.906 --> 08:08.106
Before I can tell you about Sevilla's story

08:08.107 --> 08:11.207
I gotta tell you about Felix.

08:11.208 --> 08:14.208
He's the real protagonist of this tale.

08:14.209 --> 08:17.009
Even if he's not gonna make it through the night.

08:17.010 --> 08:20.510
Main thing you gotta know,
he was a great detective.

08:21.511 --> 08:25.211
He didn't think he was a hot potato,
he just was.

08:26.412 --> 08:28.912
But then he fell for the wrong kind of dame.

08:28.913 --> 08:30.413
Who doesn't?

08:30.914 --> 08:33.320
And he borrowed... scratch that...

08:33.321 --> 08:35.941
stole some money
in order to get away with her

08:35.942 --> 08:37.700
to live happily ever after.

08:37.701 --> 08:41.201
He planned the whole thing perfectly,
outwitted his opponents...

08:41.202 --> 08:45.002
misdirected like a magician, switched the bag...

08:45.003 --> 08:48.303
lost the tail, and waited for her.

08:51.104 --> 08:52.104
Sorry.

08:53.605 --> 08:54.905
I thought you were someone else.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.906
I read this book once.

10:18.907 --> 10:20.800
That book is out of print.

10:22.201 --> 10:25.701
Time passed to fast before you saw her.

10:26.402 --> 10:28.402
Then it stopped short.

10:28.403 --> 10:30.403
Short on a dime.

10:38.004 --> 10:42.604
Time passed to fast before you saw her.

10:42.605 --> 10:48.205
Then it stopped short.
Short on a dime.

10:50.006 --> 10:54.206
She's so pretty,
She's so pretty...

10:54.207 --> 10:59.007
She's so pretty, you've never seen so pretty

10:59.008 --> 11:02.108
in all of your time.

11:02.109 --> 11:07.709
And you can get the governor on the line

11:07.710 --> 11:12.110
and win it with all of your might.

11:13.411 --> 11:18.111
But you can't change the fact
that she's a diamond,

11:18.112 --> 11:20.312
shiny diamond

11:20.313 --> 11:28.213
and you, sir, are merely just a man.

11:29.014 --> 11:35.114
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

11:52.115 --> 11:57.615
Men have tried since she first grew into

11:57.616 --> 12:01.716
the golden masterpiece that she is.

12:03.617 --> 12:06.217
Whip smart and bright,

12:06.218 --> 12:08.118
bright as lightning.

12:08.919 --> 12:12.019
But they weren't ever on par

12:12.020 --> 12:15.420
with the miss.

12:15.421 --> 12:20.421
You can be stranded on an isle with her

12:20.422 --> 12:24.922
and hope she gets bored with herself.

12:26.623 --> 12:31.000
You can't change the fact that she's a diamond,

12:31.001 --> 12:32.801
shiny diamond

12:32.802 --> 12:36.402
and you, sir, are merely

12:36.993 --> 12:38.503
just a man.

12:43.504 --> 12:44.999
What're you looking at?

12:46.300 --> 12:47.500
Excuse me?

12:48.001 --> 12:49.501
What're you looking at?

12:50.402 --> 12:52.702
Not at you, buddy.
What's that supposed to mean?

12:52.703 --> 12:54.603
I'm not looking at you, I'm looking at her.

12:54.604 --> 12:56.704
Well, that's what it looks like.
Then we're in agreement.

12:56.705 --> 12:58.605
Well I don't like you looking at her.

12:59.606 --> 13:01.206
What do I care what you like?

13:01.207 --> 13:04.107
Cause that's my girlfriend
and I don't like you looking at her.

13:04.108 --> 13:06.308
She's a singer.
Everyone's looking at her.

13:06.309 --> 13:07.909
Not the way you're looking at her.

13:07.910 --> 13:09.510
Relax.

13:09.911 --> 13:11.611
Just watching her sing.

13:11.612 --> 13:13.312
You're thinking dirty thoughts about her.

13:14.613 --> 13:16.013
Actually I wasn't.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.474
You can be stranded on...

13:19.475 --> 13:20.475
Prove it.

13:20.476 --> 13:22.806
Vance, stop it!
Baby, I'm handling this.

13:22.807 --> 13:24.107
Just leave him alone.

13:24.108 --> 13:25.908
You said this wasn't gonna happen again tonight.

13:25.909 --> 13:27.100
I warned you not to serve him.

13:27.101 --> 13:29.301
Leave the man alone.
I'm sorry, mister.

13:29.302 --> 13:31.502
You probably like the way he's looking at you,
you sick twist.

13:31.503 --> 13:33.003
Drop dead!

13:33.004 --> 13:34.324
Just let me talk to you.

13:34.325 --> 13:35.525
If you don't finish your set tonight,

13:35.526 --> 13:37.626
you're gonna have to play
an extra 15 minutes tomorrow.

13:37.627 --> 13:40.307
You need to leave now, please.

13:40.308 --> 13:42.408
It isn't so much, baby,
just let me talk to you.

13:42.409 --> 13:46.209
I have no interest whatsoever in talking to you,
or in hearing you talk ever!

13:46.210 --> 13:49.110
I'm crazy about you.
You are crazy, period. Let go!

13:49.111 --> 13:51.801
Where would you be without me?
You're about to find out again.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.402
I'm sorry about that.
Hold it.

13:58.403 --> 14:01.303
Miss Click, you signed a contract specifying
two full sets...

14:01.304 --> 14:03.854
What part of I'm in the middle of something here
do you not understand?

14:03.855 --> 14:05.300
The management doesn't take these things lightly.

14:05.301 --> 14:07.500
Oh, I shudder. I quake.

14:08.301 --> 14:09.701
And I quit.

14:13.302 --> 14:15.202
Come on, baby. Come back!

14:18.603 --> 14:19.999
Oh, you had a flip?

14:21.900 --> 14:23.900
You should  probably go home
and sleep it off, huh?

15:37.401 --> 15:39.300
Please, mister, don't tell anyone about this.

15:39.301 --> 15:41.700
I only shut my eyes for 5 minutes,
but I meant no harm, honestly.

15:41.701 --> 15:44.672
If the management finds out that I fell asleep
in a client's room again, that's it.

15:44.673 --> 15:45.973
I'm out on the street.

15:45.974 --> 15:48.044
I've been working double shifts
plus school

15:48.045 --> 15:50.245
so I haven't been getting much sleep.
Last time they said I was a thief

15:50.246 --> 15:52.476
because the woman in the room
dropped her earring down the drain

15:52.477 --> 15:55.967
The time before that they implied that I was soliciting
sexual favors which the management grounds upon,

15:55.968 --> 15:58.700
Not the soliciting so much
as the not cutting them in on the profits

15:58.701 --> 16:00.101
so I yelled at them and told them,

16:00.102 --> 16:03.102
Who the hell do they think I am?
Just because I fell asleep on the man's bed

16:03.103 --> 16:04.503
doesn't mean I slept with the man.

16:04.504 --> 16:06.804
I don't think you're a thief.

16:06.805 --> 16:07.805
Really?

16:07.806 --> 16:08.806
Really.

16:08.807 --> 16:10.800
Well, that's very perceptive of you,
because I'm not.

16:10.801 --> 16:12.401
I swear on the Virgin of Guadalupe.

16:12.402 --> 16:15.002
You probably don't know who that is,
but she means the world to me.

16:15.003 --> 16:18.103
However I did manage to notice that you had
a superhero costume in your suitcase

16:18.104 --> 16:20.804
so I hung it, so it wouldn't wrinkle.

16:20.805 --> 16:23.505
That's Tiltawor's outfit, isn't it?
She's my favorite.

16:23.506 --> 16:25.306
Not that I have time to waste to go to the pictures

16:25.307 --> 16:28.707
but my little sister's obsessed,
so she relays all the stories to me.

16:29.908 --> 16:31.308
Where did you get it?

16:31.309 --> 16:33.109
A friend of mine works in one of the studios.

16:33.110 --> 16:36.310
It's an exact replica of the one in the pictures.

16:37.111 --> 16:39.600
Holy Toledo, that is really neat.

16:42.801 --> 16:46.101
In any case, I'd best get back to work
so I don't lose my job.

16:46.602 --> 16:48.202
Would you like to keep it?

16:48.203 --> 16:49.503
Oh, I need it.

16:49.504 --> 16:53.104
I have to pay for my sister's school
and I'm the only one she has.

16:53.105 --> 16:54.805
No, I mean the costume.

16:56.806 --> 16:58.006
What do you mean?

16:58.007 --> 17:00.607
The person I got it for doesn't need it anymore.

17:00.608 --> 17:01.608
Would you like it?

17:01.909 --> 17:03.109
Really?

17:06.410 --> 17:07.810
What's your angle?

17:07.810 --> 17:09.810
What angle?
Are you a costume salesman?

17:09.811 --> 17:11.400
Because I don't have any money.

17:11.401 --> 17:14.701
You're in luck. I'm not.
Then what's your angle?

17:14.702 --> 17:18.942
In my life so far nobody ever gave me something
when they weren't expecting something back.

17:18.943 --> 17:21.443
Not that they gave me very much, mind you.
But I give a lot back.

17:21.444 --> 17:24.144
You could say that's my problem.
I give too much for too little.

17:24.145 --> 17:26.500
But that sounds dirty.
I mean emotionally.

17:26.501 --> 17:29.501
If I tell you something, will you promise
not to take it the wrong way?

17:30.902 --> 17:32.572
I talk too much.
Bingo!

17:32.573 --> 17:35.173
Only around smart people.
It's a complex.

17:35.174 --> 17:37.274
Rest assured, I'm not smart.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.375
You're just saying that.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.376
Who are you gonna believe?

17:41.877 --> 17:44.677
Maybe not smart,
but a shade less dumb than the others.

17:44.678 --> 17:47.478
I'm Sevilla. Like the Spanish city.

17:48.479 --> 17:51.379
Felix, like... Felix.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.580
So, you sure I can keep it?

17:54.981 --> 17:57.081
Keep it, don't keep it, suit yourself.

17:59.382 --> 18:02.502
I'll come back after I finish my rounds
and model it for you.

18:30.703 --> 18:32.003
That was quick.

18:37.704 --> 18:38.904
Hi.

18:38.905 --> 18:39.900
Hi.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.501
Mind if I come in?

18:41.502 --> 18:43.402
I hate drinking alone.

18:45.103 --> 18:46.203
Come in.

18:49.204 --> 18:51.204
I wanted to thank you for earlier.

18:52.705 --> 18:53.905
I didn't do anything.

18:53.906 --> 18:56.106
You got the show stopped.
That's more than most.

18:56.107 --> 18:59.900
It was a good show.
If you like wakes.

19:01.201 --> 19:02.701
Where's your friend?

19:02.702 --> 19:05.102
Oh, friendship's got nothing to do with it.

19:05.103 --> 19:08.003
Very tiresome fellow
if you don't mind my saying.

19:08.004 --> 19:09.204
I don't mind.

19:10.805 --> 19:13.405
Funny meeting somebody nice
on a night like this.

19:13.606 --> 19:15.306
I wouldn't go that far.

19:15.307 --> 19:18.007
I once stole a crutch from a cripple.

19:18.008 --> 19:21.008
Somebody modest, then.
Real estate, maybe.

19:22.209 --> 19:24.109
I'm sick of realism.

19:24.710 --> 19:26.800
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

19:26.801 --> 19:28.601
I don't disappoint that easily.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.392
Years of practice.

19:30.393 --> 19:32.503
Don't go changing your habits on my account.

19:33.404 --> 19:34.794
Tell me.

19:34.795 --> 19:35.795
What?

19:35.796 --> 19:37.500
The primary reason you're here.

19:37.501 --> 19:39.901
At the show, in this room, tonight.

19:39.902 --> 19:41.102
You first.

19:41.103 --> 19:43.003
Just passing through.

19:43.004 --> 19:45.404
Three night engagement.
Didn't you read the sign?

19:45.405 --> 19:46.405
Not till then.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.206
You know the drill. I had dreams.

19:50.107 --> 19:51.800
What kind of dreams?

19:52.101 --> 19:54.801
The kind that have been tried
and found wanting.

19:56.402 --> 19:57.502
Such as?

19:59.003 --> 20:01.703
Trade on my natural charm and talent and...

20:01.704 --> 20:03.204
become a big singer.

20:03.205 --> 20:05.895
Then maybe graduate to pictures and who knows,

20:05.896 --> 20:10.396
when I get old and deaf I'd open a restaurant,
a little bistro, a bar...

20:10.397 --> 20:11.597
On the beach.

20:12.898 --> 20:14.778
Sure. I like the beach.

20:14.779 --> 20:15.979
Who doesn't?

20:16.280 --> 20:17.680
My ex-husband.

20:17.681 --> 20:19.381
Didn't like the beach?

20:19.882 --> 20:23.482
Didn't like any sand in the shoes.
Still you married him.

20:24.083 --> 20:26.683
Had to get out of Monroe City, Indiana, somehow.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.584
He had a car?
He had a truck. Are you a cop?

20:29.585 --> 20:31.655
Why?
You ask questions like a cop.

20:31.656 --> 20:33.796
How's that?
Like you're not really interested in the answer,

20:33.797 --> 20:35.197
but the way I answer.

20:35.198 --> 20:37.198
I'm a cop.
No kidding.

20:37.699 --> 20:39.199
You're on a stakeout?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.660
I was gonna hop a train.
Changed your mind?

20:42.661 --> 20:44.501
Missed my train.
When's the next one?

20:44.502 --> 20:46.802
7 a.m.
My bus leaves at six.

20:46.803 --> 20:47.803
Where to?

20:48.504 --> 20:49.904
Away.

20:51.505 --> 20:53.105
So you missed your train,

20:53.106 --> 20:56.496
checked into the closest hotel not realizing
you might meet the woman of your dreams.

20:56.497 --> 20:58.307
The woman of my dreams stood me up.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.900
Penny drops, bad girl.

21:01.901 --> 21:03.801
You don't know the half of it.

21:05.402 --> 21:07.002
How'd you meet the woman of your dreams?

21:07.003 --> 21:08.403
Why do you wanna know?

21:08.904 --> 21:11.800
I'm a fundamentally curious person.
Undercover bust.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.999
Got this stuff in pictures,
cops falling for robbers.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.800
She wasn't a robber, just an accessory.

21:16.801 --> 21:20.101
A guy like you needs a woman
more than just an accessory.

21:20.102 --> 21:22.102
A guy like me?
What's that supposed to mean?

21:24.303 --> 21:26.003
First tell me about her.

21:28.504 --> 21:31.104
Beat it, ladies.
You can stay.

21:35.405 --> 21:37.205
You're Swedish Mary, aren't you?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.756
Excuse me?
Make this easy on yourself,

21:40.757 --> 21:43.157
we got hours of tape conversations
where he talked about you.

21:43.158 --> 21:46.000
For the record, he's nicknamed you HM.

21:46.201 --> 21:47.901
High Maintenance.

21:50.802 --> 21:52.300
I'm not the person you think.

21:52.301 --> 21:53.801
You're not Swedish Mary?

21:54.902 --> 21:56.102
No.

21:57.703 --> 21:59.503
I'm Italian.
Italian?

21:59.504 --> 22:01.304
Si, from Milano.

22:01.605 --> 22:02.999
What's your name?

22:03.600 --> 22:05.600
Rosa.
Rosa.

22:05.601 --> 22:08.200
Let's write this down.
Rosa what?

22:08.801 --> 22:10.801
Rosa Magnoni.
You're Italian?

22:10.802 --> 22:12.102
Yes, why?

22:12.103 --> 22:15.713
Cause your accent ain't so hot.
Ain't so hot? No capisce.

22:15.714 --> 22:17.314
It sounds foreigny.
Funny?

22:17.315 --> 22:19.515
Foreigny.
I think your accent sounds foreigny.

22:19.516 --> 22:21.906
I don't have an accent.
Everybody has an accent.

22:26.407 --> 22:28.100
What is your name?

22:28.101 --> 22:30.258
That's not important now.
How long have you known Otto?

22:30.259 --> 22:33.300
In one way it is like we've
always known each other.

22:33.301 --> 22:35.701
And in another way?
Six months.

22:35.702 --> 22:36.999
You want a cigarette?

22:39.400 --> 22:42.000
Are you his mistress?
Just a friend.

22:42.001 --> 22:45.001
A kind of friend who likes
to do errands for him, right, Mary?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.702
What do you mean?
Drop things off...

22:51.703 --> 22:53.800
pick things up?
Like his dry-cleaning?

22:53.801 --> 22:57.101
I do not like your insinuation.
I don't like your accent.

22:57.102 --> 22:58.999
This is your problem.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I thought you said your name was Rosa.

23:01.001 --> 23:02.501
I know what I said.

23:02.502 --> 23:04.502
You didn't flinch when I just called you Mary.

23:05.703 --> 23:09.103
I know what you are trying to do.
It won't work.

23:09.204 --> 23:10.554
He liked giving gifts?

23:10.555 --> 23:12.755
I do not remember.
Jewelry, diamonds?

23:12.756 --> 23:14.256
I want a lawyer.

23:14.257 --> 23:16.257
Then get one.
The city's full of them.

23:16.258 --> 23:18.598
I mean I want a lawyer now, here,
to answer your questions.

23:18.599 --> 23:20.909
You're not charged with anything,
we're just having a chat.

23:20.910 --> 23:21.910
Oh...

23:21.911 --> 23:25.211
You think you're so tough
with your big gun, don't you?

23:25.212 --> 23:26.212
I do.

23:31.013 --> 23:32.513
Why are you smiling?

23:37.214 --> 23:38.814
The only good thing about this moment

23:39.999 --> 23:41.945
is I'm sure that as long as I live

23:41.946 --> 23:43.746
I'll never feel this lonely again.

23:47.047 --> 23:48.847
Am I free to go now?

23:55.048 --> 23:56.708
Took me by surprise.

23:56.709 --> 23:59.209
I liked that she dropped the accent to say it.

24:00.010 --> 24:02.610
The whole thing just clicked.

24:02.611 --> 24:06.001
And I decided then that I liked Swedish Mary.

24:07.002 --> 24:10.402
Patience is an overrated virtue,
but I waited.

24:10.603 --> 24:12.703
Then I pounced.

24:12.704 --> 24:14.804
Took me only one year.

25:44.305 --> 25:45.705
Have we met before?

25:46.206 --> 25:48.106
I think I'd remember.

25:57.607 --> 25:59.999
Otto kept all the loot intact.

26:00.500 --> 26:03.500
Except for one harmless little diamond.

26:07.001 --> 26:08.701
I guess he couldn't resist.

26:09.502 --> 26:11.302
Who could blame him?

26:20.003 --> 26:22.403
Sometimes I hate my job, you know?

26:24.504 --> 26:26.004
What job?

26:29.305 --> 26:30.905
Mary...

26:33.006 --> 26:36.406
We've been tailing Otto and his crew
for three years.

26:39.207 --> 26:41.507
I've gotta close this case.

26:43.808 --> 26:45.808
What are you talking about?

26:54.009 --> 26:55.209
Sorry.

26:56.010 --> 26:57.710
I thought you liked her.

26:57.711 --> 27:00.661
More than I'd like to.
Love? You don't say.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.002
It wasn't in love yet.

27:02.003 --> 27:04.503
Something nearly identical.

27:04.504 --> 27:06.904
But still you busted her.

27:06.905 --> 27:08.705
No, I gave her an out.

27:08.706 --> 27:10.406
You had her turn against Otto.

27:10.407 --> 27:13.908
Well, they call it between a rock
and a hard place for a reason.

27:13.909 --> 27:16.709
I don't like snitches.
It's an ugly word.

27:16.710 --> 27:18.210
Ugly job.

27:18.711 --> 27:20.711
Sounds like you're talking from experience.

27:23.812 --> 27:26.312
Your husband downstairs?
Vance?

27:26.313 --> 27:28.113
Not my husband.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.714
You said you were married.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.415
I got married at sixteen to a travelling salesman.

27:32.416 --> 27:34.316
What kind of salesman?

27:34.317 --> 27:36.717
A nice and boring one who talked a lot.

27:36.718 --> 27:40.118
What did he sell?
What's the difference? The point is...

27:40.119 --> 27:44.009
a young wife gets left alone at home
all day in the big city

27:44.010 --> 27:45.910
she's bound to get restless.

27:45.911 --> 27:47.411
That's how I met Vance.

27:47.412 --> 27:49.972
Before he was a victim of the Santa Ana racetrack

27:49.973 --> 27:52.373
he was a jazz guitarist.

27:52.374 --> 27:53.804
A good one, too.

27:53.805 --> 27:55.705
He offered you private lessons.

27:55.706 --> 27:57.506
I told him I was married.

27:57.507 --> 27:58.797
What did he say?

27:58.798 --> 28:01.288
He said many great guitar players were married.

28:03.789 --> 28:06.389
Vance's gambling took its toll pretty damn fast.

28:06.390 --> 28:09.890
Next thing I knew I was a...
what did you call it?

28:12.291 --> 28:13.591
An accessory.

28:28.092 --> 28:30.592
Is she alright?
What question is that?

28:30.593 --> 28:32.493
Two.
Kinda keeps you out of jail.

28:32.494 --> 28:33.494
Two.

28:33.495 --> 28:36.300
She'll keep her mouth shut,
just leave her out of it.

28:36.501 --> 28:38.201
I got a different idea.

28:39.702 --> 28:41.802
Yeah? Since when do you have ideas?

28:42.803 --> 28:44.503
I think we should use her as a decoy.

28:44.504 --> 28:47.604
I mean, there's no sense in cutting in
another piece of ass if we got her around.

28:50.805 --> 28:52.705
Who gave you permission to talk about her ass?

28:55.606 --> 28:57.706
What would I have to do?
Stay out of this!

29:02.000 --> 29:03.607
Don't talk to me like that.

29:05.508 --> 29:07.708
I'll talk to you however I wanna talk to you.

29:08.999 --> 29:10.309
In front of your friends, you mean?

29:15.810 --> 29:17.210
Why did you put up with him?

29:18.911 --> 29:20.311
I don't know.

29:26.412 --> 29:28.512
Guess I can think of a couple of reasons.

30:04.713 --> 30:06.813
But when his partners got pinched after the job

30:06.814 --> 30:09.414
I lost all respect for the creep.

30:22.615 --> 30:24.715
Bad day.
Bad day?

30:25.916 --> 30:29.216
It was a roll of the dice.
Why not you?

30:29.717 --> 30:32.117
Cause I have a lucky charm.
You.

30:34.018 --> 30:36.118
I saw you at that pay phone, Vance.

30:38.319 --> 30:41.019
You got it all wrong, baby.
Do I?

30:41.420 --> 30:43.200
Right, now look... if you wanna split

30:43.201 --> 30:44.501
if you wanna say we're history,
that's fine,

30:44.502 --> 30:47.402
but don't go running your mouth
about stuff you know nothing about.

30:47.403 --> 30:49.603
That can make my life pretty messy.
Your life is a mess.

30:49.604 --> 30:51.954
You can't pin that on me.
I'm warning you.

30:51.955 --> 30:53.855
You're threatening me!
You call it what you like.

30:53.856 --> 30:55.956
I don't like being threatened.

30:55.957 --> 30:58.400
You're a coward and a cheat.

31:00.001 --> 31:01.301
But I love you.

31:02.002 --> 31:03.602
You don't love anybody.

31:03.603 --> 31:06.903
Baby, I wanna make you a star, alright?
I have the money now.

31:06.904 --> 31:08.000
I can take you all the way.

31:08.001 --> 31:09.401
Get out of my sight.

31:09.402 --> 31:10.402
Or what?

31:11.603 --> 31:13.403
Or I'll throw this vase at your head.

31:13.404 --> 31:15.304
I'll duck.
Not quick enough.

31:17.005 --> 31:19.855
Anyway, he ended up in the hospital
with thirty stitches.

31:19.856 --> 31:21.456
How did you manage such perfect aim?

31:21.457 --> 31:24.457
Captain of my high school softball team,
all star.

31:24.458 --> 31:27.658
I can almost see him now.
Then what?

31:27.659 --> 31:30.959
I skipped town.
Travelled the country several times...

31:30.960 --> 31:32.860
the pursuit of happiness and all that.

31:33.361 --> 31:36.061
I pursued it everywhere, with different guys...

31:36.062 --> 31:38.562
even with a nice lady tennis player once.

31:39.263 --> 31:40.663
It didn't take.

31:40.664 --> 31:43.664
I kept singing, some crackpot idea.

31:43.665 --> 31:46.265
Turns out I'm not the world's greatest singer.

31:46.266 --> 31:47.666
Sounded good to me.

31:50.567 --> 31:52.267
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

31:52.868 --> 31:54.808
Is it about the nice lady tennis player?

31:54.809 --> 31:56.709
It caught my attention, I won't lie.

31:56.999 --> 31:59.410
She was the wife of a club owner.

31:59.411 --> 32:02.491
Couldn't believe a modern girl such as myself
had never played.

32:02.492 --> 32:03.792
Played what?

32:03.793 --> 32:05.393
Tennis, detective.

32:05.394 --> 32:07.194
She offered to teach me.

32:07.195 --> 32:09.905
More private lessons, like the guitar player.

32:09.906 --> 32:11.906
I can see how you'd make that leap.

32:11.907 --> 32:13.800
You don't get all your facts,

32:13.801 --> 32:15.551
just your bits of someone's life story

32:15.552 --> 32:17.552
you maybe take me for a person who gets

32:17.553 --> 32:19.603
lots of offers for private lessons.

32:21.104 --> 32:24.004
I've never met anyone with said
proclivity before.

32:24.005 --> 32:27.105
I never met a detective who said proclivity before.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.506
So, what happened to you?
Had a few private lessons, then what?

32:32.508 --> 32:34.108
Decided you didn't like the game?

32:34.409 --> 32:36.409
Call me old fashioned.

32:36.410 --> 32:38.510
But it wasn't just that.

32:41.711 --> 32:44.211
Lady tennis player was complicated.

32:45.412 --> 32:47.112
The lady tennis player was alright.

32:47.113 --> 32:49.613
The problem was...
Let me guess.

32:50.414 --> 32:51.474
Her husband.

32:51.475 --> 32:53.675
What makes you say that?
My job description.

32:53.676 --> 32:54.876
What is?
Intuition.

32:54.877 --> 32:57.507
Ten bucks that he liked watching the lessons.

32:57.508 --> 32:59.308
No, that wasn't the problem.

33:01.309 --> 33:04.309
He was a club owner who once a month
performed in his own club.

33:04.310 --> 33:06.690
He had a famous act called...

33:06.691 --> 33:08.191
The Concubines.

33:08.192 --> 33:11.002
of the cunning Calibenos.

34:48.103 --> 34:50.402
I woke up alone in a room...

34:50.404 --> 34:52.504
no idea how long I'd been there.

34:52.505 --> 34:56.205
But shortly after the three concubines came in
and began to undress me.

34:58.006 --> 35:01.706
I tried to fight back,
but they were expert ticklers.

35:02.307 --> 35:03.407
Ticklers?

35:03.408 --> 35:06.408
I know how it sounds, but they were vicious.
I was powerless.

35:06.409 --> 35:09.409
Ticklers...
They undressed me,

35:09.410 --> 35:12.000
and then he walks in, still in costume.

35:12.001 --> 35:14.501
They held me down and caressed me.

35:14.502 --> 35:17.202
I have never been caressed like that before.

35:17.703 --> 35:18.803
And then...

35:20.004 --> 35:21.104
And then?

35:23.005 --> 35:24.705
I fell into a deep sleep.

35:26.806 --> 35:28.406
The next morning I woke up...

35:28.407 --> 35:31.207
in my hotel room, still naked.

35:31.208 --> 35:33.608
No sign of my clothes anywhere.

35:33.609 --> 35:36.409
I found out later
I had slept for two whole days.

35:36.410 --> 35:39.000
Or at least I couldn't account
for two whole days.

35:39.001 --> 35:42.001
Like time just vanished into the ether.

35:43.302 --> 35:44.502
Who is it?

35:44.503 --> 35:46.803
Maureen came to see me.

35:46.804 --> 35:49.124
Who's Maureen?
The lady tennis player.

35:49.125 --> 35:50.825
Not Maureen Chapman?

35:50.826 --> 35:54.226
Associated Press female tennis player of the year?

35:54.227 --> 35:56.487
Three years straight.
Her husband was murdered.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.688
I read about that. It was a big deal.
Philadelphia, right?

35:59.689 --> 36:02.689
Didn't realize you followed tennis.
I might not have told you this part.

36:02.690 --> 36:04.390
Do you know what actually happened?

36:05.891 --> 36:08.681
All I know is she came to tell me.

36:08.682 --> 36:11.182
Hector's dead.
Who is Hector?

36:11.483 --> 36:13.773
The cunning Calibenos, my husband.

36:13.774 --> 36:15.794
He might have been killed.

36:15.895 --> 36:17.295
When? How?

36:17.296 --> 36:18.596
I don't know.

36:19.597 --> 36:21.297
That's a tragedy.

36:22.998 --> 36:25.498
You should probably leave town.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.299
Alright.

36:28.300 --> 36:30.100
If you think that's for the best.

36:47.501 --> 36:48.701
You can wear this.

36:52.302 --> 36:53.402
Maureen.

36:57.103 --> 36:58.303
I'm sorry.

37:02.104 --> 37:04.604
She paid my bill and gave me a train ticket.

37:04.605 --> 37:07.005
I never did find out what happened to her husband.

37:07.006 --> 37:08.806
They had to dreg the lake to find him.

37:08.807 --> 37:11.107
Boating accident, the report said.

37:11.108 --> 37:12.708
What do you think?

37:13.009 --> 37:14.209
About what?

37:14.810 --> 37:16.500
Was it an accident?

37:19.601 --> 37:21.901
Time slows down before an accident,
you know?

37:22.402 --> 37:24.902
My last ten years were pretty slow.

37:25.603 --> 37:27.703
Coming back here was the accident.

37:31.704 --> 37:33.304
What's in the briefcase?

37:33.305 --> 37:34.305
Money.

37:38.606 --> 37:41.206
I don't believe you.
Like I care what you believe.

37:41.207 --> 37:43.957
A lot of money?
Enough to make your dreams come true.

37:43.958 --> 37:46.958
Why would you tell me just like that?
I'm not worried about you.

37:46.959 --> 37:48.959
I don't know if I should be offended or not?
Who's money is it?

37:48.960 --> 37:50.830
Who says it's not mine?
Intuition.

37:50.831 --> 37:52.831
It's a long story.
It's a long night.

37:52.832 --> 37:54.232
I'll tell you what.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.333
What do you say...

37:59.234 --> 38:00.999
we get a refill downstairs?

38:01.000 --> 38:02.900
I'm not too popular down there, remember?

38:02.901 --> 38:04.701
Let's see if we can't do something about that.

38:10.502 --> 38:12.602
What about the money?
Don't worry.

38:12.603 --> 38:15.203
No one's gonna take it without making sure
I know all about it.

38:38.404 --> 38:39.504
We're closed.

38:40.005 --> 38:41.505
Official business.

38:41.506 --> 38:43.296
What did she do?
That's the official part.

38:43.297 --> 38:45.447
Oh, real smart guy.
I don't care who you are.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.400
I'm not allowed to keep the place open for you.

38:47.601 --> 38:49.001
Fix us a couple of sandwiches, will you?

38:50.202 --> 38:51.392
What do I look like to you?

38:51.393 --> 38:53.093
Like a barman who knows how to fix a sandwich.

38:53.794 --> 38:57.394
Go on. I know it's been a quiet night.
I may make it worth your while.

38:57.395 --> 39:00.195
Fix yourself one.
That'll be it.

39:03.196 --> 39:04.796
Hope you like grilled cheese.

39:04.797 --> 39:06.097
My favorite.

39:06.598 --> 39:09.998
My partner Jim and I were put on
Mary detail.

39:09.999 --> 39:12.299
Funny choice of words in retrospect.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.800
What took you so long?
I had to stop for gas.

39:14.801 --> 39:16.001
What's the news here?

39:16.002 --> 39:19.302
She watched some TV, now she's taking a bath.

39:19.303 --> 39:22.303
I had a thought.
End of day, it's nearly eleven.

39:22.304 --> 39:23.704
Hypothetical.

39:23.705 --> 39:25.705
Yeah.
You meet a young lady.

39:25.706 --> 39:27.706
Yeah?
She's adventurous.

39:27.707 --> 39:31.107
You mean like Betty?
Keep Betty out of it.

39:31.108 --> 39:33.408
Why do I keep here talking to you, Jim?

39:34.109 --> 39:36.109
Different sort of adventures.

39:36.510 --> 39:41.110
Maybe you're not up to her.
You can't be a mountain climber... What?

39:41.211 --> 39:43.411
Nothing. She's singing.

39:48.312 --> 39:50.212
What's that?
That's Spanish.

39:51.213 --> 39:53.113
What I'm driving at is this.

39:54.114 --> 39:57.184
All men agree on one thing,
and that is:

39:57.185 --> 39:59.395
that man needs variety.

39:59.396 --> 40:01.200
Oh, I agree with that.

40:01.201 --> 40:03.201
This is a deeply flawed argument.

40:03.502 --> 40:06.102
Is this the way Betty taught you the story?

40:06.103 --> 40:10.099
See, glass half-full mentality right there.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.300
The way I see it

40:11.301 --> 40:13.401
if you don't get action every day

40:13.402 --> 40:15.002
that's the win.

40:15.003 --> 40:19.003
You, I don't know why any woman in her right mind
would let you anywhere near her,

40:19.004 --> 40:22.954
holiest of holies, but let's say you get lucky,
somebody's willing.

40:22.955 --> 40:24.405
You protect that.

40:24.406 --> 40:26.806
A guy comes along and says you like beer.

40:26.807 --> 40:28.807
But you gotta like beer every day of your life?

40:28.808 --> 40:30.208
Well, why not?

40:30.209 --> 40:33.209
I love football.
That means I gotta watch it every day?

40:33.410 --> 40:34.610
Sure.

40:34.611 --> 40:39.311
Aren't I gonna get tired of watching football,
drinking beer day after day all my life?

40:39.812 --> 40:40.812
Maybe.

40:40.813 --> 40:44.293
But I am willing to do the work
to find out that truth.

40:44.294 --> 40:46.694
And if it turns out that that's the case,

40:47.695 --> 40:51.595
I trust myself to find other interests.

40:51.596 --> 40:55.196
Jim, you know this feeling
that you're feeling right now.

40:55.197 --> 40:58.097
Contentment in the sacred bond of marriage?

40:58.098 --> 41:02.398
This restless fever of romantic delusion,
you know it's not got lost, don't you?

41:02.399 --> 41:05.359
You know what you are?
Yeah, I'm a cynical bastard.

41:05.360 --> 41:09.000
Or I'm a curmudgeonly naysay who calmed you out,
I should receive a compliment.

41:09.001 --> 41:12.001
It must be hard work being you,
but mark my words.

41:12.002 --> 41:14.602
You'll meet a charming young woman...

41:14.603 --> 41:16.803
It's the hardest thing to find in American life...

41:16.804 --> 41:20.804
You'll jump on that train gladly,
you'll go off...

41:20.805 --> 41:25.305
Good old Jim, always trying to drag me down
to his level of misery.

41:25.806 --> 41:28.106
What he couldn't possibly foresee

41:28.107 --> 41:31.507
is that this charming young woman
he was conjuring for me

41:31.908 --> 41:34.008
was presently right next door.

41:44.509 --> 41:45.609
Hello?

41:47.310 --> 41:48.610
Hi, Otto.

41:49.311 --> 41:51.011
I'm taking a bath.

41:51.999 --> 41:53.612
Of course I'm alone.

41:56.513 --> 41:59.113
I may catch a cold if I don't put something on.

41:59.114 --> 42:01.904
But I'll be ready for you, don't you worry.

42:02.605 --> 42:04.205
You just come on over.

42:04.206 --> 42:05.906
I'll see when you get here.

42:06.507 --> 42:07.707
Bye.

42:24.008 --> 42:26.608
Whoa, you look weird.

42:27.409 --> 42:30.609
If you had a lick of sense,
you'd grab your stuff now and get out of here.

42:30.999 --> 42:33.210
I don't have a lick of sense.

42:37.411 --> 42:41.111
This experience could make a decent chapter
in an autobiography.

42:41.112 --> 42:42.712
Chapter 12,

42:43.013 --> 42:46.913
I was born of modest means
so I've always had a fascination with buff.

42:46.914 --> 42:49.999
God, it's a lame excuse for liking money.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.900
I have no self-esteem.

42:52.901 --> 42:56.301
My father was a misunderstood poet,
my mother was a masochist.

43:00.702 --> 43:03.602
Does everybody think all this nonsense to themselves?

43:03.603 --> 43:06.703
Is everybody as bad inside their head as me?

43:06.704 --> 43:10.454
It can't be. I mean, some people must have
wonderfully perceptive epiphanies

43:10.455 --> 43:14.755
that trickle down like rain water
and make them feel all cozy inside.

43:16.256 --> 43:18.056
Why can't I think of stuff like that?

43:18.057 --> 43:19.857
Why is my brain so boring?

43:19.858 --> 43:21.358
Why is it anything?

43:23.159 --> 43:25.159
But I can change, right?

43:25.960 --> 43:27.900
I mean, I have to at some point.

43:29.001 --> 43:31.401
Grow up, take charge.

43:32.902 --> 43:35.202
Make something good out of all this misery.

43:35.203 --> 43:37.403
Subvert the codes.

43:42.704 --> 43:44.004
Oh, God...

43:45.005 --> 43:47.505
There's a dead giveaway written all over your face.

44:03.406 --> 44:05.999
I do not trust words.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.900
Language is a disease of the throat.

44:19.901 --> 44:21.701
What am I thinking now?

44:21.702 --> 44:24.302
Am I thinking of not thinking?

44:24.303 --> 44:27.603
It's like concentrating on your breathing.

44:27.904 --> 44:30.304
It can drive you crazy.

44:30.305 --> 44:33.905
C-R-A-Z-Y

44:35.506 --> 44:37.806
Petrie Savorin said so.

44:37.807 --> 44:39.600
Don't play the word game.

44:43.201 --> 44:44.901
I'm not doing this.

44:44.902 --> 44:46.702
This is not me.

44:47.403 --> 44:50.003
I'm not impulsive. I'm pragmatic.

44:50.604 --> 44:53.004
The meandering, the waiting.

44:53.605 --> 44:56.905
The not doing anything or getting anywhere.

44:58.506 --> 45:00.306
Gives me kind of relief.

45:01.507 --> 45:04.007
Like I'm finally dropping the charade.

45:11.508 --> 45:14.408
There's a second life underneath the real life.

45:14.999 --> 45:17.609
Like a subway underneath the city.

45:19.510 --> 45:23.010
Oh, my imagination is working overtime.

45:23.311 --> 45:26.611
I don't care what people do behind closed doors.

45:26.612 --> 45:28.912
Or open doors.

45:29.113 --> 45:30.313
I don't care.

45:31.614 --> 45:36.314
Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.

45:36.315 --> 45:40.615
This is what a youthful nonconformist was born to do.

45:40.616 --> 45:45.516
I own this world and I feel all tingly inside.

45:45.517 --> 45:49.717
A surge of excitement pulsing
through my entire being.

45:50.618 --> 45:52.618
Like the man said...

45:52.619 --> 45:56.919
I'm a street walking cheater
with a heart full of napalm.

45:56.920 --> 46:00.620
The world's forgotten girl.

46:05.421 --> 46:07.321
What was that?
Sounds like she fell.

46:09.022 --> 46:10.802
Where is this scumbag?

46:15.503 --> 46:16.603
I'm going in.

46:17.704 --> 46:19.404
What the hell are you talking about?

46:20.305 --> 46:22.005
Otto's due here any second.

46:22.706 --> 46:24.506
I have had feeling about this.

46:24.507 --> 46:26.307
Don't you dare go in that room!

46:30.408 --> 46:32.708
Have you ever saved anyone's life before?

46:34.509 --> 46:36.009
It's not pretty.

46:38.410 --> 46:42.510
There's sticking your fingers down their throat
and when that fails,

46:42.511 --> 46:47.111
pumping of the stomach,
peculiar kind of  animal gurgling,

46:47.112 --> 46:50.612
noise they make...
No matter how fetching they are in person...

46:50.613 --> 46:56.113
there's this infantlike smell
when you're pushing their face down the sink

46:56.114 --> 46:58.514
or running them a bath
and their knees keep going

46:58.515 --> 47:00.615
and they're falling all over the place,
you know what I mean?

47:01.416 --> 47:02.916
I do now.

47:02.917 --> 47:08.017
But all of it goes away
the second you realize they're alright.

47:14.518 --> 47:15.718
Hi.

47:16.219 --> 47:17.519
Hi.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.550
This isn't real.

47:23.421 --> 47:25.321
I must wake up now.

47:25.522 --> 47:27.302
No, you're awake.

47:33.703 --> 47:35.403
Get some clothes on her.

47:35.404 --> 47:37.304
And get rid of the deadbeat.

47:50.205 --> 47:53.805
At this point things get a little screwy.

47:57.006 --> 47:59.506
That was just a warm-up.
This one's gonna hurt.

47:59.507 --> 48:01.607
Who are you trying to convince?

48:01.608 --> 48:02.808
Yourself?

48:02.809 --> 48:04.509
Or your little playmate?

48:06.510 --> 48:08.010
He had a point.

48:08.011 --> 48:09.111
It hurt.

48:10.712 --> 48:13.612
Funny what near-death experiences
do with people.

48:13.613 --> 48:18.613
I don't think Mary and I ever discussed being together.
We just suddenly were.

48:18.614 --> 48:21.604
This wasn't as easy as it sounds...

48:21.605 --> 48:25.005
and compromises were made on all sides.

48:25.006 --> 48:28.206
Otto hadn't killed me because a cop is still a cop.

48:28.207 --> 48:32.207
But I was yanked from the case.
Hell, I pretty much destroyed the case.

48:32.208 --> 48:34.708
So I was put on extended leave.

48:34.709 --> 48:37.999
Jim came around once in a while, but...

48:38.000 --> 48:40.100
otherwise Mary became my nurse.

48:41.701 --> 48:43.101
and my cook

48:45.602 --> 48:47.102
and my obsession.

48:51.203 --> 48:53.903
Lest it all sound bleak and dreary,

48:53.904 --> 48:57.404
rest assured we found ways
of entertaining each other.

49:02.905 --> 49:04.705
Not that we had that much in common,

49:07.406 --> 49:11.006
I like jazz.
I like comic books.

49:11.007 --> 49:14.807
I like westerns.

49:14.808 --> 49:19.008
I like rip-roaring tales about singing pirates.

49:19.009 --> 49:20.209
What do you make of that?

49:22.010 --> 49:24.210
Personally, singing pirates never did it for me.

49:25.011 --> 49:27.411
No, I mean the fact
that we had nothing in common.

49:28.012 --> 49:30.712
I don't think people look for a copy
of themselves in other people.

49:31.813 --> 49:34.213
I think they look for someone
they're compatible with.

49:34.214 --> 49:35.804
At least they should.

49:35.805 --> 49:37.505
Never thought of it that way.

49:39.506 --> 49:40.906
Is that what you do?

49:40.907 --> 49:42.707
What are you drinking?

49:42.708 --> 49:46.108
My whole life I never thought
of anyone but myself.

49:46.109 --> 49:47.609
I think you're just saying that.

49:47.910 --> 49:51.010
You strike me as an unselfish person.

49:51.811 --> 49:54.921
Trust me, I wouldn't know
what an unselfish act looks like.

49:57.722 --> 50:02.022
I suppose the one thing me and Mary did have

50:02.023 --> 50:04.023
in spite of anything else was compatibility.

50:04.024 --> 50:05.204
Tell me a secret.

50:05.205 --> 50:07.105
Ladies first.

50:08.806 --> 50:10.406
I'm a terrible driver.

50:10.807 --> 50:13.107
Honestly, I can't believe
I haven't run somebody over.

50:13.108 --> 50:14.808
Something personal.

50:15.909 --> 50:18.009
I secretly wish I were a superhero.

50:18.010 --> 50:21.710
I thought we were being serious.
I think about it all the time.

50:21.711 --> 50:25.811
My life is so unexciting.
I just hate the everyday world.

50:26.412 --> 50:29.812
I wish I had a secret identity
and went around beating up bullies.

50:30.113 --> 50:31.713
That's what you do.

50:32.414 --> 50:33.914
Not exactly.

50:34.615 --> 50:38.515
We both have victim complexes.
We're just different sides of the same coin.

50:40.416 --> 50:42.416
Where do you get this stuff?

50:42.617 --> 50:46.317
You ask because it makes sense
or because it's weird?

50:46.318 --> 50:49.618
I ask because you're a girl.

50:49.619 --> 50:51.719
Girls don't need to be that smart.

50:53.020 --> 50:56.120
You ever wonder what superheroes
are like in the sack?

50:56.921 --> 50:57.821
No.

50:57.822 --> 50:59.621
Never?
No.

50:59.722 --> 51:03.402
You never wonder what it might be like
to be with a woman if you're Superman?

51:03.403 --> 51:04.703
Superman's an alien.

51:04.904 --> 51:07.504
How can he altogether be interested in a lady?

51:07.605 --> 51:10.105
He is so into the ladies.
I mean...

51:10.106 --> 51:13.806
the poor guy can barely speak to Lois
without getting all flustered.

51:14.207 --> 51:17.807
Walking around with all that power
between his legs.

51:17.808 --> 51:20.708
This conversation is a little weird.

51:20.709 --> 51:23.009
You've never thought about Tiltawor.

51:24.610 --> 51:25.810
Who's Tiltawor?

51:26.411 --> 51:30.211
How old are you, Grandpa?
Tiltawor, she wears the black mask...

51:30.212 --> 51:34.602
and carries around the  ray gun that her
scientist father bequeathed her on his deathbed.

51:34.603 --> 51:35.903
Say "bequeathed" again.

51:35.904 --> 51:40.604
And she spins like this and she can drive
vault through concrete.

51:40.605 --> 51:42.705
I mean, she's my favorite.

51:51.406 --> 51:53.106
What took you so long, Mary?

51:54.207 --> 51:56.007
Don't get excited.

51:57.508 --> 51:58.808
Who did this to you?

51:58.809 --> 52:00.709
He didn't mean it. I provoked him.

52:00.710 --> 52:02.710
Otto?
What have you been doing talking to him?

52:02.711 --> 52:05.111
It's not like I have a choice.
Why not?

52:05.112 --> 52:06.802
Don't make me spell it out.

52:08.003 --> 52:09.003
Try me.

52:09.004 --> 52:11.304
He still owns me, Felix.
Nobody owns you.

52:11.305 --> 52:13.495
That's a pretty postcard.
Where do you think I go after work...

52:13.496 --> 52:15.296
when I come home late?
Why are you doing this?

52:15.297 --> 52:17.897
I don't enjoy it, but it's part of the deal.

52:19.298 --> 52:21.698
We're not children. Let's not pretend.

52:22.999 --> 52:26.099
What does this mean?
I'm sorry, but you've known all along.

52:26.100 --> 52:29.300
If I knew, then why did I let you?

52:34.401 --> 52:36.201
Because you're like me.

52:40.002 --> 52:42.602
There's this sickness inside of you...

52:44.603 --> 52:46.303
that needs to hurt.

52:48.204 --> 52:49.804
Or to be hurt.

52:55.605 --> 52:57.555
Because we're the same.

52:57.556 --> 52:59.956
From that moment my life changed.

52:59.957 --> 53:02.907
Or should I say,
my death sentence was signed.

53:02.908 --> 53:05.508
You like the love story so far?
Sure, kid.

53:05.509 --> 53:07.209
A real kick in the head.

53:07.410 --> 53:09.110
What happened next?

53:09.411 --> 53:10.411
Next...

53:12.912 --> 53:15.312
Next I put a six-week plan into motion

53:15.313 --> 53:17.803
that came to fruition only a couple of hours ago.

53:18.604 --> 53:21.484
Details are tedious, take my word for it,

53:21.485 --> 53:24.185
but the basic premise is simplicity itself.

53:25.186 --> 53:27.486
I received inside information

53:27.487 --> 53:31.887
that Otto's crew was to rob DeFalco's
steel factory payroll...

53:34.088 --> 53:36.288
and stash the money at a safe location...

53:36.289 --> 53:39.889
and return to claim it next morning
when the coast was clear.

53:42.890 --> 53:46.790
All I had to do was wait
and walk out rich.

53:47.891 --> 53:49.591
That was the plan anyway.

54:08.492 --> 54:10.692
But plans do what plans always do.

54:11.793 --> 54:13.493
They go wrong.

56:35.594 --> 56:37.694
While I was busy improvising,

56:37.695 --> 56:40.105
my inside man's only task for the evening

56:40.106 --> 56:43.006
was to keep Otto drooling over her
at the Vixenville.

56:46.007 --> 56:48.607
You know, there's a moment in the current review

56:48.608 --> 56:50.408
where she goes backstage to change

56:50.409 --> 56:53.409
before other dancers come out
right on time before she rejoins.

56:54.110 --> 56:56.310
A fifteen window while she changes.

56:56.311 --> 56:58.811
Just enough time for her to slip out the back,

56:58.812 --> 57:03.112
jump in a cab, and join me in the station.

57:04.413 --> 57:05.513
And?

57:06.614 --> 57:08.214
She didn't show.

57:09.315 --> 57:10.515
What happened?

57:12.216 --> 57:13.816
Either she changed her mind...

57:14.717 --> 57:16.017
or she's dead.

57:17.118 --> 57:19.218
This makes no difference for the outcome.

57:21.119 --> 57:22.319
You're drunk.

57:23.920 --> 57:26.420
My God, it took a lifetime to happen.

57:28.121 --> 57:29.721
What if she's in danger?

57:34.000 --> 57:37.522
You dames are all the same,
you're always looking out for their sister.

57:37.623 --> 57:41.023
Have you not been paying attention?
I've played my cards.

57:42.324 --> 57:44.604
Maybe I had a lousy hand, you know?

57:44.825 --> 57:47.225
It looked good enough at the time,
by the way.

57:47.226 --> 57:49.326
That's it for me. She's gone.

57:49.727 --> 57:51.627
And I'm dead, game over.

58:01.028 --> 58:02.508
I know what you're thinking.

58:03.209 --> 58:06.009
You're thinking he's drunk.

58:06.710 --> 58:08.310
I've come here to take his money.

58:08.311 --> 58:09.701
But don't tell him.

58:10.602 --> 58:11.502
Don't tell him.

58:12.003 --> 58:18.203
I'm not... I'm not saying that
just because of your bountiful presence

58:18.204 --> 58:20.604
I mean, I'm beautiful.

58:21.105 --> 58:22.105
No, I mean...

58:24.206 --> 58:27.006
Keep it down, please.
People are trying to talk out here.

58:27.007 --> 58:29.507
Who do you think you are?
Shhh! Wait, let's not...

58:29.508 --> 58:32.808
It's the police!
Open up!

58:32.809 --> 58:33.999
Sorry...

58:35.000 --> 58:36.400
Open up! It's the police...

58:37.801 --> 58:39.401
You?

58:40.302 --> 58:41.402
You?

58:43.603 --> 58:45.003
Take that off!

58:45.004 --> 58:47.204
You don't deserve to wear that costume...

58:47.205 --> 58:50.205
Please, mister, keep your voice down.

58:50.206 --> 58:51.706
You'll get me fired.

58:51.707 --> 58:52.707
What's the rumpus?

58:52.708 --> 58:55.508
What's all this?
What are you doing?

58:55.509 --> 58:57.509
I know everybody here.

58:57.510 --> 58:59.410
Is she the one you were talking about?

58:59.411 --> 59:01.201
Is this creep your new main squeeze now?

59:01.202 --> 59:03.202
He said he had a lot of aggression
to take out on someone

59:03.203 --> 59:05.303
and he has not let up on taking it out.

59:05.304 --> 59:08.804
Who are you calling a creep, little snit?
I got your number, mate.

59:08.805 --> 59:10.405
Better watch your language, sport.

59:10.406 --> 59:12.606
Vance...
It wouldn't hurt you, my friend,

59:12.607 --> 59:14.207
to show a little bit of politeness.

59:16.608 --> 59:19.008
Maybe it's time for you to crawl back
to your room and dry out.

59:19.009 --> 59:20.209
You stupid animal.

59:20.510 --> 59:22.210
You really are...

59:22.811 --> 59:24.299
an animal.

59:24.500 --> 59:26.500
Congratulations.
You just assaulted a policeman.

59:26.501 --> 59:28.001
Ah, he's bluffing.

59:32.102 --> 59:33.702
Why didn't you tell me?

59:44.203 --> 59:45.403
You'd better go.

59:45.404 --> 59:47.204
Why try to get me out of the room so fast?

59:47.205 --> 59:49.305
Because I don't want him to wake up
and arrest you.

59:49.306 --> 59:50.606
Suddenly you care about me?

59:50.607 --> 59:53.107
Vance, let's go.

59:53.108 --> 59:54.408
Go back to the room,

59:54.409 --> 59:57.109
put your face in the pillow,
lower your superhero pants and wait for me.

59:59.710 --> 01:00:02.410
But hurry.
I can't afford to lose this job.

01:00:04.511 --> 01:00:05.611
What's this guy to you?

01:00:05.612 --> 01:00:08.212
Nothing, a friend.

01:00:09.013 --> 01:00:11.413
You're all nervous. Practically in a sweat.

01:00:11.414 --> 01:00:14.014
What are you doing?
I don't know.

01:00:14.015 --> 01:00:16.015
Something's keeping you here.

01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:19.716
Vance...

01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:20.717
Don't!

01:00:22.718 --> 01:00:23.918
Vance

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:32.719
Holy Moses.

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.820
Hey, do you have any idea...

01:00:39.021 --> 01:00:40.501
how much money's in here?

01:00:41.502 --> 01:00:42.502
Vance!

01:00:46.003 --> 01:00:47.703
Okay, okay, uh...

01:00:48.704 --> 01:00:49.904
Okay, I'm gonna figure this out.

01:00:50.205 --> 01:00:51.805
Right, uh...

01:00:52.706 --> 01:00:54.406
Right, I'm gonna say this one time.

01:00:54.407 --> 01:00:58.607
I'm gonna take this money
and I'm gonna live like the king of kings.

01:00:58.608 --> 01:01:01.508
Everything else is water under the bridge.
A brand new start.

01:01:02.209 --> 01:01:03.809
I'll make all your dreams come true.

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:06.010
A do over. You and me.

01:01:06.411 --> 01:01:07.611
You coming?

01:01:20.212 --> 01:01:22.112
Crazy as a couple of waltzing mice.

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:24.613
So long, sweetheart.

01:01:43.514 --> 01:01:44.714
Follow that car.

01:01:50.715 --> 01:01:52.015
Vance!

01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:27.316
I'm sorry he hit you.

01:02:29.807 --> 01:02:32.417
I know when you wake up
you're gonna want to have a word with him.

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:36.718
I'd like to have a word or two with him myself.

01:03:02.719 --> 01:03:05.019
Who is it?
Housekeeping.

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.320
Go away.

01:03:08.521 --> 01:03:11.721
I do not need my room cleaned.
It's me!

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:13.622
Sevilla.

01:03:21.323 --> 01:03:24.923
Sevilla. It's really you.
What are you doing here?

01:03:24.924 --> 01:03:26.724
Can I come in?
No, no...

01:03:26.725 --> 01:03:28.725
Oh, are you in the middle of something?

01:03:28.726 --> 01:03:31.726
No...
Why did you say you were the housekeeper?

01:03:31.727 --> 01:03:33.427
I am the housekeeper.

01:03:33.728 --> 01:03:35.928
Dressed like that?
Oh...

01:03:35.929 --> 01:03:38.429
It's not my uniform.
You're the housekeeper.

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:41.590
It' s not like I'm a third-class citizen.
It's only a job.

01:03:41.591 --> 01:03:43.491
No, no, I didn't mean it like that.

01:03:43.492 --> 01:03:48.782
Housekeeping is a noble occupation.
What do you want?

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:50.883
Are you a doctor?
No.

01:03:50.884 --> 01:03:52.384
I'm a salesman.

01:03:52.385 --> 01:03:54.585
I install shower doors.

01:03:55.086 --> 01:03:57.186
I was really hoping you were a doctor.

01:03:58.487 --> 01:03:59.787
What's wrong?

01:04:00.288 --> 01:04:02.922
I think he's dead.
But I'm not sure.

01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:04.999
Who's dead?
The fellow I was gonna go see.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
How did he die?
I didn't say he was dead. I said he might be.

01:04:08.001 --> 01:04:09.801
But I'm not sure. But I hope not.

01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:13.702
You should call an ambulance.
Oh, no, I can't afford to get fired.

01:04:13.703 --> 01:04:16.203
And if they were to find out
that I was doing anything unusual...

01:04:16.204 --> 01:04:17.204
Like what?

01:04:18.205 --> 01:04:19.405
Nothing.

01:04:20.606 --> 01:04:22.106
Can you come up with me?

01:04:22.107 --> 01:04:25.807
Sevilla, I wouldn't be any good.
I don't know what to do in a situation like this.

01:04:25.808 --> 01:04:28.608
Please, please, please.
I don't know anything about that.

01:04:32.409 --> 01:04:33.909
Let me put my pants on.

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:34.910
Okay...

01:04:36.611 --> 01:04:37.901
Were you in the bathroom?

01:04:37.902 --> 01:04:40.202
Just took them off.

01:04:51.203 --> 01:04:52.603
You're very quiet.

01:04:53.804 --> 01:04:54.999
Yeah.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.500
That's nice.

01:05:02.701 --> 01:05:04.701
Not dead. Dead drunk.

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:06.802
Why did you hit him?

01:05:06.803 --> 01:05:10.203
Oh, not me.
A man named Vance.

01:05:10.204 --> 01:05:12.104
A real brute of a man.
Subhuman.

01:05:12.105 --> 01:05:16.105
One of those people who just takes
what he wants and never apologizes.

01:05:17.106 --> 01:05:18.606
No manners.

01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:21.307
I wish I was more like that.

01:05:21.808 --> 01:05:23.308
Reckless.

01:05:23.909 --> 01:05:26.609
We could all use to be
a little bit more like that, I guess.

01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:29.910
Some things we do, some things we don't.

01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:35.111
You have a very soothing demeanor, Eugene.

01:05:37.012 --> 01:05:38.902
You remembered my name!

01:05:38.903 --> 01:05:40.393
Of course I remembered.

01:05:40.394 --> 01:05:43.194
Don't be too sure because people
forget it in a second.

01:05:43.195 --> 01:05:46.295
Not me.
It's my favorite name.

01:05:46.996 --> 01:05:50.296
My mother used to read me that book
Eugene Onegin when I was a child.

01:05:51.697 --> 01:05:53.497
Have you read that?
No.

01:05:53.498 --> 01:05:55.798
Oh, it's a wonderful story...

01:05:55.799 --> 01:05:59.359
about a selfish Russian man
and this wonderful woman

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.160
who loves to read books.

01:06:01.161 --> 01:06:04.601
And she falls in love with him.
She declares her love for him and he rejects her

01:06:04.602 --> 01:06:07.602
and then he ends up shooting
this innocent young poet.

01:06:07.603 --> 01:06:09.903
That sounds very sad.

01:06:09.904 --> 01:06:10.904
It is.

01:06:10.905 --> 01:06:13.205
It's about the death of innocence.

01:06:13.206 --> 01:06:15.006
I'll never forget this horrifying passage

01:06:15.007 --> 01:06:17.907
where Tatyana has a nightmare
being chased through this

01:06:17.908 --> 01:06:20.608
frozen landscape by a terrifying bear.

01:06:21.409 --> 01:06:25.009
And then she hides in a hut and is
confronted by demons and goblins.

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:27.910
You say your mother read this to you
when you were a child?

01:06:27.911 --> 01:06:30.711
A lot.
It was the only book we had in the house.

01:06:30.712 --> 01:06:33.612
It was left there by a Russian pianist
when he came visiting.

01:06:33.613 --> 01:06:36.113
Pianist.
Yes.

01:06:36.114 --> 01:06:38.714
It was an opera by...

01:06:38.715 --> 01:06:39.915
What's his name?

01:06:39.916 --> 01:06:41.716
Piotr Ylitch Tchaikovsky.

01:06:42.217 --> 01:06:43.817
Do you like opera?

01:06:44.518 --> 01:06:45.918
Just the hits.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:47.909
I don't remember very much about it.

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:50.110
But I think the voices are soothing.

01:06:51.511 --> 01:06:52.911
Like your demeanor.

01:07:00.012 --> 01:07:01.700
I had an uncle named Piotr.

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:03.401
You did?

01:07:03.402 --> 01:07:04.502
Not really.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.903
Of course I was immediately staggered
by her beauty.

01:07:11.904 --> 01:07:14.404
I blind man could tell you that.

01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:18.800
But as I watched her,
what I was thinking was this:

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:21.101
What if you were reading a book,

01:07:21.102 --> 01:07:23.102
a fine book,

01:07:23.103 --> 01:07:25.503
maybe even a great book,

01:07:25.504 --> 01:07:29.404
and what if you already knew
how this book was gonna end?

01:07:29.405 --> 01:07:32.000
Would you still root for the protagonists to fall in love

01:07:32.001 --> 01:07:33.999
even if they don't end up together?

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.900
Would you still love the people you love now

01:07:36.901 --> 01:07:39.601
if you knew eventually they were gonna leave you?

01:07:43.402 --> 01:07:44.602
What's wrong?

01:07:45.403 --> 01:07:46.703
Excuse me.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.104
You're not supposed to show your mug around here.

01:08:52.104 --> 01:08:53.805
Yeah, well, I'm not here to see you.

01:09:20.305 --> 01:09:21.706
Don't get too excited.

01:09:25.506 --> 01:09:27.107
That's what I'm here to see him about.

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:40.108
Hey, hey!

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.009
What are you doing?

01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:43.899
You're not invisible, you know?

01:09:43.901 --> 01:09:46.501
I'm such a fool.

01:09:46.801 --> 01:09:48.202
What seems to be the problem?

01:09:48.502 --> 01:09:51.103
Well, I... I locked the keys in my car and...

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:52.904
my husband's gonna kill me.

01:09:52.904 --> 01:09:55.205
He won't be too impressed
if you smash the window.

01:09:55.206 --> 01:09:57.306
I don't know how to pick the lock.

01:09:57.507 --> 01:09:59.607
You wouldn't happen to know how to do that?

01:09:59.608 --> 01:10:02.108
You sure this is your car.
It's my husband's.

01:10:02.109 --> 01:10:04.209
What are you doing down here at this hour?

01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:07.210
That's, um... private.

01:10:07.211 --> 01:10:08.801
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

01:10:08.802 --> 01:10:11.702
Can I be honest?
Please, don't.

01:10:11.703 --> 01:10:15.203
Honest women, they frighten me.

01:10:15.804 --> 01:10:17.604
I like that.
You do?

01:10:30.505 --> 01:10:32.005
Hey, Paul, get back here.

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.506
I came downtown with a friend...

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:49.707
if my husband finds out, he'll be upset.
Nothing unbecoming, you understand, but...

01:10:50.408 --> 01:10:51.808
he has a temper.

01:10:55.509 --> 01:10:57.200
Little skittish, aren't you?

01:10:57.201 --> 01:10:59.101
It's past my bedtime.

01:11:00.102 --> 01:11:01.802
You gonna help me?

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.303
Thank you.

01:11:32.504 --> 01:11:34.504
I can take it from here.

01:11:34.505 --> 01:11:36.005
Aren't you gonna look for your key?

01:11:36.006 --> 01:11:37.006
Oh.

01:11:37.007 --> 01:11:38.807
Of course.

01:11:39.808 --> 01:11:42.008
You know, I'm sure you have to go back to work.

01:11:42.009 --> 01:11:43.689
I don't want to keep you, so...

01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:46.800
You need me to start it for you?
I can maybe hotwire it for you.

01:11:46.801 --> 01:11:50.301
I'm not really following you.
I know this isn't your car.

01:11:50.302 --> 01:11:52.302
But I like you.
That's nice.

01:11:52.303 --> 01:11:54.000
So let me offer you a riddle.

01:11:55.801 --> 01:11:58.201
Mr. Freddie says you can go.

01:11:59.602 --> 01:12:02.200
You're square?
He says you can go.

01:12:03.501 --> 01:12:06.601
He counted the money. He knows we're square.

01:12:06.602 --> 01:12:10.502
I even threw in a little lecture
for his extraordinary patience.

01:12:15.703 --> 01:12:18.803
He said,
tell him he can go.

01:12:18.804 --> 01:12:22.804
You answer this riddle correctly,
I start your engine and let you be.

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:24.605
You don't answer it correct,

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:26.306
I still start your engine,

01:12:26.307 --> 01:12:30.607
but you gotta let me check your oil
cause you look just about due.

01:12:30.608 --> 01:12:32.308
Is this already the riddle?

01:12:32.309 --> 01:12:33.309
Right.

01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:35.410
Have a nice life.

01:12:41.611 --> 01:12:43.111
The riddle is this.

01:12:43.112 --> 01:12:46.212
I was a prophetess who became leprous.

01:12:46.213 --> 01:12:49.713
White as snow for a short time.

01:12:50.914 --> 01:12:52.314
Who am I?

01:12:52.315 --> 01:12:54.315
This is a riddle.
From the Bible.

01:12:54.816 --> 01:12:56.616
You do go to church, don't you?

01:12:57.217 --> 01:12:59.417
Never. It really bangs my nylons.

01:13:00.018 --> 01:13:01.218
Vance.

01:13:05.019 --> 01:13:06.519
Freddie wants to see you.

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:15.820
The correct answer is Myriam.

01:13:15.821 --> 01:13:18.021
Now scoot on over, Toots.

01:13:23.222 --> 01:13:24.222
Hey!

01:13:24.223 --> 01:13:25.223
Hey!

01:13:27.024 --> 01:13:28.404
Where are you going?

01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:31.205
I was just having a bit of fun with you, darling.

01:13:39.906 --> 01:13:41.306
Eugene, what is wrong?

01:13:41.307 --> 01:13:44.007
I'm just clearing up in here.

01:13:54.208 --> 01:13:55.308
Uh...

01:14:02.509 --> 01:14:04.109
I think it's decent now.

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:10.610
Why did you clean up the room for me?

01:14:10.611 --> 01:14:13.511
Everybody does that when the housekeeper comes.

01:14:13.812 --> 01:14:15.512
Make yourself comfortable.

01:14:23.613 --> 01:14:25.313
Who's Rosemary?

01:14:26.014 --> 01:14:27.714
Absolutely nobody.

01:14:27.715 --> 01:14:31.315
That was a poem, wasn't it?
Nonsense. I was practicing my typing.

01:14:34.016 --> 01:14:35.216
You should go.

01:14:35.217 --> 01:14:36.617
What is wrong?

01:14:39.218 --> 01:14:41.218
It's been a long night and...

01:14:41.719 --> 01:14:44.019
I gotta get to sleep.

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.800
I'm not going anywhere.

01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:49.601
Well, you can't stay here.
Why not?

01:14:49.602 --> 01:14:51.802
You're worried about getting fired for one.

01:14:56.703 --> 01:14:58.703
That's a suicide note, isn't it?

01:15:01.804 --> 01:15:03.004
Let me see it.

01:15:25.505 --> 01:15:26.705
It's beautiful.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.406
But why?

01:15:30.407 --> 01:15:32.707
It's a hard thing to summarize.

01:15:32.708 --> 01:15:33.808
Try.

01:15:35.609 --> 01:15:38.800
You're young.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

01:15:39.901 --> 01:15:41.891
I'm sick.
So?

01:15:41.892 --> 01:15:44.202
I don't want to be a burden to anybody.

01:15:44.203 --> 01:15:45.703
Do you have family?

01:15:45.704 --> 01:15:47.604
No, no...
Wife?

01:15:47.605 --> 01:15:50.105
I had... at one time.

01:15:50.106 --> 01:15:51.306
Rosemary?

01:15:52.007 --> 01:15:53.107
Yeah.

01:15:53.808 --> 01:15:56.708
Did she pass away?
No, she left me.

01:15:57.509 --> 01:15:59.409
She was very young.

01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:03.110
Did she ever read your poetry?

01:16:03.111 --> 01:16:04.411
My what?

01:16:04.612 --> 01:16:06.212
Your poetry.

01:16:06.213 --> 01:16:08.013
Did she know that you were a poet?

01:16:08.014 --> 01:16:09.714
I'm not a poet.

01:16:16.215 --> 01:16:18.005
Will you read it to me?

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:20.406
No. Come on.

01:16:20.407 --> 01:16:22.600
No, Sevilla.

01:16:35.701 --> 01:16:38.200
Darkling, I listen.

01:16:38.901 --> 01:16:42.900
For many a time I have been in love
with easeful death.

01:16:42.901 --> 01:16:48.901
Called him soft names in many a mused rhyme.

01:16:49.202 --> 01:16:52.202
To take into the air my quiet breath.

01:16:54.303 --> 01:16:57.103
Now more than ever it seems rich to die.

01:16:58.704 --> 01:17:01.304
To cease upon the midnight with no pain.

01:17:03.005 --> 01:17:05.305
While thou art pouring forth

01:17:07.006 --> 01:17:09.306
thy soul abroad

01:17:10.607 --> 01:17:12.907
in such ecstasy.

01:17:16.808 --> 01:17:19.008
That's the most beautiful poem I ever heard.

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:20.609
I didn't write it.

01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:23.710
No?
No.

01:17:24.711 --> 01:17:26.411
A guy named Keats wrote it.

01:17:26.412 --> 01:17:29.999
I think it's from Ode to a Nightingale.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.600
Why the nightingale?

01:17:32.601 --> 01:17:34.401
My wife is a singer.

01:17:34.202 --> 01:17:38.002
Rosemary?
She goes by the name Hannah Click now.

01:17:38.803 --> 01:17:41.303
The singer from downstairs?
Yeah.

01:17:41.304 --> 01:17:43.404
That's your wife?
Hm-hmm.

01:17:45.505 --> 01:17:49.605
The first time I laid eyes on her
she was 16 years old.

01:17:51.506 --> 01:17:54.706
I mean, not a breath of spring air...

01:17:54.807 --> 01:17:57.207
but spring itself.

01:17:57.208 --> 01:18:00.808
This picture is not a good representation of her.

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:03.609
I am no good with people.
I paint pets.

01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:05.310
I'm really good at dogs.

01:18:05.311 --> 01:18:09.311
She had on a summer dress
and she was eating an ice cream cone.

01:18:09.312 --> 01:18:14.312
I kid you not.
The luckiest ice cream cone in the world.

01:18:15.613 --> 01:18:17.813
The very next day I asked her to marry me.

01:18:19.414 --> 01:18:20.814
Does she know?

01:18:20.815 --> 01:18:21.815
What?

01:18:22.616 --> 01:18:24.616
That you're still in love with her.

01:18:26.617 --> 01:18:28.317
I'm not.
Hm-hmm...

01:18:28.318 --> 01:18:31.800
I just came here to say goodbye in person.
And did you?

01:18:35.901 --> 01:18:37.401
I got cold feet.

01:18:38.402 --> 01:18:39.502
I...

01:18:41.503 --> 01:18:42.803
was leaving her the poem...

01:18:44.104 --> 01:18:47.804
I was about to go through with it
when you knocked on the door.

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:07.406
I'd have been the first one to find you.

01:19:11.007 --> 01:19:12.707
Well, maybe I did it...

01:19:13.108 --> 01:19:18.508
and you're just an angel
sent to get me through to the other side.

01:19:20.309 --> 01:19:24.409
So I look like an angel.
I've never seen a housekeeper look like this before.

01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:28.200
I mean, the superhero outfit...

01:19:28.201 --> 01:19:30.301
Yeah, I could take it off.

01:19:32.002 --> 01:19:34.502
I beg your pardon?
I mean, I could take it off, you know...

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:38.203
and put on my maid's uniform if you like.
No.

01:19:41.804 --> 01:19:43.404
What did you think I meant?

01:19:45.605 --> 01:19:47.905
Oh!
Hmm...

01:19:50.306 --> 01:19:52.706
I'm not against that either.
You're not?

01:19:54.007 --> 01:19:57.307
But I need a bath, and I need some sleep,

01:19:57.308 --> 01:19:59.908
and I need you to promise me
that you're gonna make it through the night.

01:20:00.309 --> 01:20:03.309
And we can discuss arrangements in the morning.

01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:07.010
And you're not worried about
somebody coming in seeing you here and firing you?

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:11.811
Oh, God, I am so tired of trying not to get fired.

01:20:13.712 --> 01:20:15.612
Do you have savings?

01:20:15.613 --> 01:20:18.413
Oh, yeah. I own my own company.

01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:21.204
Good. Cause I'm putting my sister through college.

01:20:22.305 --> 01:20:23.305
Help?

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:45.606
How do you feel?

01:20:48.707 --> 01:20:49.907
Terrible.

01:20:49.908 --> 01:20:51.608
I'm not stuck on a bed sober.

01:20:51.809 --> 01:20:53.409
How did you find me?

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.510
A loan shark by the name of Freddie Manouche

01:21:00.311 --> 01:21:04.411
was paid a friendly visit
by a degenerate gambler a little while ago.

01:21:05.912 --> 01:21:08.312
Kid owed him fifteen G's.

01:21:08.313 --> 01:21:11.200
Paid it in full.

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:15.001
A story that warms the heart.

01:21:15.002 --> 01:21:18.800
Brady has it on good authority
this kid hasn't got a pot to piss in.

01:21:18.801 --> 01:21:21.001
They shouldn't go around lending money
to people like that.

01:21:21.002 --> 01:21:24.302
Freddie called me.
I interviewed this goofball.

01:21:25.003 --> 01:21:28.503
He sent me here.
He said you gave it to him.

01:21:28.999 --> 01:21:31.304
It's not someone who can keep his mouth shut.

01:21:31.305 --> 01:21:34.005
No, he likes to talk.

01:21:34.006 --> 01:21:37.106
And I can't imagine
I'm the only one Freddie called.

01:21:37.107 --> 01:21:39.999
Or the first. Which means...

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.300
you're running out of time.

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:49.801
Ever the optimist, Jim.
I've already run out of time.

01:21:49.802 --> 01:21:51.800
Why'd you do it?
You know why.

01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:56.001
See now, right there you lose me.
I have no idea why.

01:21:56.902 --> 01:21:59.802
If you tell me it was for love...
Check.

01:21:59.803 --> 01:22:01.503
I'd say I don't buy it.

01:22:01.504 --> 01:22:04.300
You tell me it's for money.
Double check,

01:22:04.301 --> 01:22:09.001
I'd say not my partner. I know him too well.
He knows this could never work.

01:22:09.002 --> 01:22:11.002
He knows it better than anyone.

01:22:11.003 --> 01:22:13.403
You're just mad because you didn't see it coming.

01:22:13.404 --> 01:22:17.704
I didn't see it coming
because it's completely out of character.

01:22:17.705 --> 01:22:19.305
That's why you gotta work.

01:22:20.006 --> 01:22:21.406
Where's the money?

01:22:23.107 --> 01:22:25.107
I don't know.
Where is it?

01:22:25.108 --> 01:22:26.508
I don't know.

01:22:28.309 --> 01:22:31.779
It doesn't matter.
Humor me. And it does. Where's the money?

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:35.780
I don't know.

01:22:36.681 --> 01:22:39.999
If you keep saying that,
I might have to start believing you.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.600
Do you know where Mary is?

01:22:46.501 --> 01:22:47.701
Precinct.

01:22:50.002 --> 01:22:51.302
What for?

01:22:51.303 --> 01:22:54.803
There was a new show tonight at the Vixenville.

01:22:54.804 --> 01:22:58.604
Our favorite sociopath was there
watching his favorite girl.

01:23:00.505 --> 01:23:03.305
But there was something off
about her performance tonight.

01:23:03.306 --> 01:23:08.906
Something undetectable to most,
but very apparent to Otto.

01:23:09.407 --> 01:23:13.307
The girl seemed nervous, aloof.

01:23:13.308 --> 01:23:15.808
Sure enough, five minutes into her routine,

01:23:15.809 --> 01:23:18.809
she twisted an ankle
and had to leave the stage.

01:23:18.810 --> 01:23:23.700
Well, Otto, sick with worry,
he rushes back to the dressing room

01:23:23.701 --> 01:23:25.701
and somehow they get into a fight

01:23:25.702 --> 01:23:29.702
and she stabs him in the right eye
with the heel of her shoe.

01:23:29.703 --> 01:23:30.903
She what?

01:23:30.999 --> 01:23:33.504
You know how they say, it's all fun and games

01:23:33.505 --> 01:23:36.805
until somebody pokes an eye out?
Well, that's just what happened.

01:23:36.806 --> 01:23:38.606
And on the way to the hospital,

01:23:38.607 --> 01:23:43.107
Otto gets news that a few of his associates
had been gunned down.

01:23:43.708 --> 01:23:46.308
And some money happens to be missing.

01:23:46.309 --> 01:23:47.609
Normally,

01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:50.510
there's only one person whose expertise I trust

01:23:50.511 --> 01:23:54.811
in putting all these disparate elements
into a cohesive whole.

01:23:54.812 --> 01:23:58.112
Normally I enjoy hearing you...

01:23:58.113 --> 01:24:00.613
piece these strands together.

01:24:00.614 --> 01:24:04.604
I'm not enjoying myself tonight, Felix.

01:24:04.605 --> 01:24:07.305
Let her go, Jim.
I did this.

01:24:07.306 --> 01:24:09.506
She poked the man's eye out.

01:24:09.507 --> 01:24:10.607
He's got another one.

01:24:12.608 --> 01:24:14.508
Somehow when I woke up this morning

01:24:14.509 --> 01:24:17.109
I never imagined my day would turn out like this.

01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:18.710
Welcome to the club.

01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:26.211
I can't protect you from Otto.

01:24:28.412 --> 01:24:30.112
And I don't deserve it.

01:24:36.713 --> 01:24:38.013
Who is it?

01:24:38.014 --> 01:24:39.514
Hannah.

01:24:41.215 --> 01:24:43.015
I made a new friend.

01:24:43.016 --> 01:24:45.616
Don't try anything stupid.
You're talking to the wrong guy.

01:24:53.317 --> 01:24:54.717
This belongs to you.

01:24:57.418 --> 01:24:59.918
My partner, Jim Logan.
Hannah Click.

01:25:03.119 --> 01:25:05.519
Vance got confused. Thought it was his.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.220
That's what I gathered.

01:25:11.321 --> 01:25:13.721
Couldn't let my mistakes ruin your chances.

01:25:17.222 --> 01:25:20.022
I call this an extremely unselfish act, Hannah.

01:25:21.023 --> 01:25:23.023
I don't think anyone would believe me.

01:25:24.224 --> 01:25:26.804
Just this once, fate is a liar.

01:25:28.505 --> 01:25:30.705
Maybe you can still find her and get away.

01:25:34.406 --> 01:25:36.606
Won't you always wonder...

01:25:37.207 --> 01:25:38.807
what if?

01:25:40.907 --> 01:25:43.307
In a few rotten nights, but that'll pass.

01:25:53.008 --> 01:25:55.008
It was nice talking to you, Felix.

01:25:57.309 --> 01:25:58.909
Bus to catch.

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:24.510
Rosemary Lynn!

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.111
Eugene?
Yeah.

01:26:29.112 --> 01:26:30.702
A little older.

01:26:30.703 --> 01:26:34.113
Forehead's a little farther back.
But it's still me.

01:26:36.414 --> 01:26:38.414
You look great.

01:26:38.415 --> 01:26:41.105
What are you doing here?
I came to see you.

01:26:41.206 --> 01:26:44.506
I saw your name on the marquee
and said, I'm gonna catch the show.

01:26:44.507 --> 01:26:47.407
And you were great.
You really were great.

01:26:47.408 --> 01:26:50.208
You saw me sing?
The night before last.

01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:52.109
It was a great show.

01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:56.400
Have you been good?

01:26:56.401 --> 01:26:57.401
Yeah.

01:26:57.402 --> 01:26:59.300
You?
Yes.

01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:00.601
Are you married?

01:27:00.802 --> 01:27:03.502
Just to you, still.
Ha!

01:27:05.803 --> 01:27:07.503
I brought you a present.

01:27:08.004 --> 01:27:09.404
What are you talking about?

01:27:09.405 --> 01:27:12.095
This is from a part of my life
that you probably don't know.

01:27:12.096 --> 01:27:14.900
But you do remember that I like to paint.
Sure.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.301
Hello, Luke.
Yeah.

01:27:20.302 --> 01:27:23.902
How did you...?
I didn't get your nose right.

01:27:23.903 --> 01:27:28.203
Noses are tough.
I'm used to painting pets, so...

01:27:28.204 --> 01:27:30.004
The nose is good, Eugene.

01:27:30.005 --> 01:27:31.605
You like it?
Yes.

01:27:31.606 --> 01:27:33.306
Good, I...

01:27:36.607 --> 01:27:40.707
How's your health?
I'm glad you asked. I feel good.

01:27:40.708 --> 01:27:42.608
Strong.
You look it.

01:27:46.509 --> 01:27:48.009
I'm sorry.

01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:51.910
I know it seems stupid to say after all this time.

01:27:53.711 --> 01:27:55.611
No, it's nice.

01:27:55.712 --> 01:27:57.912
People need forgiveness.

01:27:57.913 --> 01:28:00.913
And approval. And you have both.

01:28:02.414 --> 01:28:04.004
You're not still sore with me?

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:06.505
No.

01:28:06.506 --> 01:28:07.806
No, I...

01:28:08.207 --> 01:28:11.007
You were always out of my league,
Rosemary Lynn.

01:28:11.908 --> 01:28:13.708
You simply didn't know it.

01:28:16.009 --> 01:28:18.609
I'm just happy for the time we had together.

01:28:18.610 --> 01:28:20.810
Are you trying to make me cry?

01:28:20.999 --> 01:28:22.711
Definitely not.

01:28:23.812 --> 01:28:25.512
Alright, go on.

01:28:38.613 --> 01:28:39.803
Take care.

01:28:42.204 --> 01:28:43.304
You too.

01:29:07.705 --> 01:29:09.305
Alright.

01:29:22.706 --> 01:29:23.999
So...

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Am I all out of favors with you?

01:29:31.301 --> 01:29:33.001
It depends.

01:29:36.102 --> 01:29:38.202
What will it take to get Mary released?

01:29:39.003 --> 01:29:40.403
A phone call.

01:29:46.404 --> 01:29:48.004
Make it.

01:30:08.305 --> 01:30:09.305
It's me.

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:13.306
Let the girl go.

01:30:14.407 --> 01:30:15.407
Yeah.

01:30:19.008 --> 01:30:20.208
Now what?

01:30:23.809 --> 01:30:26.209
I want to find out what Otto's waiting for.

01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:30.210
There's something I left out.

01:30:32.411 --> 01:30:34.511
On the way to the hospital,

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:38.012
when the call comes in
about Otto's men being dead

01:30:38.003 --> 01:30:39.403
and the money gone,

01:30:40.604 --> 01:30:45.404
it so upsets Otto that his heart just stops.

01:30:47.305 --> 01:30:48.905
What do you mean stops?
He's dead?

01:30:52.206 --> 01:30:53.906
All the way dead.

01:31:16.507 --> 01:31:18.907
That's a lesson.
Don't be corny.

01:31:18.908 --> 01:31:20.778
If you want the money just take it.

01:31:20.779 --> 01:31:22.179
What money?

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.680
The money was never here.

01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:30.481
The trail went cold, is that the play?

01:31:30.482 --> 01:31:32.182
You tell me.

01:31:32.683 --> 01:31:34.183
You came here,

01:31:34.684 --> 01:31:37.304
I wouldn't tell you where the money was hidden.

01:31:38.305 --> 01:31:40.305
Refused to be tracked to the gallows.

01:31:42.006 --> 01:31:44.406
And then what?
Then I pulled a gun on you.

01:31:45.807 --> 01:31:48.807
I was just about beat
after what we'd been through.

01:32:04.408 --> 01:32:06.008
What about the kid.

01:32:06.009 --> 01:32:08.409
The kid won't talk to anybody anymore.

01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:13.490
What about the Precinct?
Gonna kill all of them?

01:32:13.491 --> 01:32:15.171
Ask Betty on the phone.

01:32:15.172 --> 01:32:18.272
Tell me you didn't touch Mary.
I didn't touch Mary.

01:32:18.273 --> 01:32:20.273
You dragged Betty into this.

01:32:20.274 --> 01:32:22.274
I keep telling you.

01:32:22.275 --> 01:32:27.675
The sacred bond of marriage is the strongest
thing there is between two people.

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:30.776
It doesn't make any sense.

01:32:37.977 --> 01:32:40.277
It's completely out of character.

01:33:18.178 --> 01:33:21.888
At the end of the day people only see
what they're prepared to see.

01:33:21.889 --> 01:33:23.289
That much I know.

01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:27.590
Most people live their lives thinking
they're the protagonists of their story

01:33:27.591 --> 01:33:31.891
when they're simply a supporting player
in somebody else's movie.

01:33:45.192 --> 01:33:46.492
Oh, my God!
