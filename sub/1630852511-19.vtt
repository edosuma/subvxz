she's more upset at the fact

01:17.978 --> 01:22.414
that Mike talked to Chris,
and talked to Old Bridge.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.583
Angelina actually
showed us tweets

01:24.652 --> 01:26.919
of Mike saying,
"All right, DM me.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.520
Let's get this party started."

01:28.589 --> 01:30.089
- Mike's, like,
making appointments

01:30.157 --> 01:31.824
to, like, talk to Chris.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.158
"Tell me more"?

01:33.227 --> 01:34.460
- I mean,
he wasn't trying to hide it.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.994
- And then there's more.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.530
- "So you can DM,
and we can start this party."

01:38.599 --> 01:41.200
- So Mike, has been talking
to Angelina for a while.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.367
- And trying--

01:42.436 --> 01:43.368
- Like, saying,
"I'm there for you.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.503
I want to be there for you."

01:44.572 --> 01:45.871
And then Lauren reached out

01:45.940 --> 01:48.507
and invited Angelina

01:48.576 --> 01:50.809
to the skin care launch
after she blocked her.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.178
- It just--it
doesn't make sense to me.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.346
I don't know how
that's gonna go.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.281
I'm definitely so proud
of Lauren.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.219

02:00.287 --> 02:02.855
But, like,
how can Mike invite Angelina

02:02.923 --> 02:04.389
to the skincare launch,

02:04.458 --> 02:08.327
and then
talk so badly about her?

02:08.395 --> 02:11.630
Like, I feel like
you're being a bad friend.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.332
- Do you think Mike,

02:13.400 --> 02:15.767
maybe he's just trying
to get everybody,

02:15.836 --> 02:17.436
like, back on the same page?

02:17.505 --> 02:19.304
- He's making it worse.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.039
And then he's making
it good for himself.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.542
I feel like Mike
is definitely gonna

02:23.611 --> 02:25.144
get [bleep] from Angelina.

02:25.212 --> 02:26.912
He dug himself deep
with this [bleep].

02:26.981 --> 02:28.981
So the fact that Angelina
is coming for him,

02:29.049 --> 02:30.516

and they all wanted
to expose you.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.073
And then you're mad
at everybody for finding out

07:22.142 --> 07:23.742
that you're [bleep] cheating
with everybody.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.076
- Kiss my ass.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.745
- Do you see how messy this is?

07:26.814 --> 07:28.079
- It's not messy on my behalf.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.748
- You've got to be
[bleep] kidding me.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.016
- Why don't you [bleep]--

07:31.084 --> 07:32.217
- What are you,
[bleep] delusional?

07:32.286 --> 07:33.318
- Wait--

07:33.420 --> 07:34.820
- Your life is
a [bleep] dumpster fire.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.087

He stood there

07:37.891 --> 07:40.058

his eyes out.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.694
Meanwhile,
he knew the whole time

07:42.763 --> 07:44.162
he didn't really love me.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.031
- I need to take a step back

07:46.099 --> 07:47.866
because it's
affecting my whole life.

07:47.935 --> 07:48.867
And it's not worth it.

They said, if anybody could

09:42.049 --> 09:43.582

09:43.650 --> 09:44.583
- You got to be [bleep]

09:44.651 --> 09:45.650

09:45.719 --> 09:46.785
It came to me--
- I don't care!

09:46.853 --> 09:47.919

09:47.988 --> 09:49.454

I would go to you first.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.156
- Your life is [bleep] messy.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.791
- Right now, I need a friend,

09:52.859 --> 09:54.659
and Mike's not being a friend.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.928
You should have told me that
they were saying that about me.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.530
Like, I need
to know these things.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.465
- When it came to my desk,

10:00.534 --> 10:01.533
right, I was like,
oh, [bleep]--

10:01.602 --> 10:02.601
- Your [bleep] desk.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.069
- I want nothing
to do with this.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.670
And that's it.
- But that's not what you said.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.439
- But--
- You said, "Start the party."

10:07.507 --> 10:09.441
- I needed to find out
if this person was legit

10:09.509 --> 10:11.676
because you were saying,
this person's a friend.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.279
Why wouldn't I entertain
a conversation from someone

10:14.348 --> 10:15.513
that you said is a friend?

10:15.582 --> 10:16.548
What's wrong with him?

10:16.617 --> 10:17.949
I got all the receipts.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.351
<i> I didn't make anything up.</i>

10:19.419 --> 10:21.886

about having a side piece.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.388
You were screaming,
"I'm gonna key your car.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.522
I'm gonna [bleep]
your apartment up."

10:24.591 --> 10:25.957

No, I never did that.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.292
- Ange, it's on the video.

10:27.361 --> 10:28.627
- Shows me going
to my friend's house.

10:28.695 --> 10:29.894
Like, who gives a [bleep]?
- It just shows you--

10:29.963 --> 10:31.129
- That Chris also knows.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.999
- Old Bridge
actually is not a friend.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.767
He's actually a side piece.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.536
Also, this guy right here,
Old Bridge, who's right here,

10:38.605 --> 10:40.872
"My husband knows about him.
He's a friend."

10:40.941 --> 10:43.742
Cool, that's fine.
Now Old Bridge comes out.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.744
He's salty now because--

10:45.812 --> 10:47.912
- While he was in this house?
- I have no idea.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.981
- Begging me to be with me?
He was like, please.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.216
I'm like, get the [bleep] out.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.418
- So wait, so you--

10:53.487 --> 10:55.286
he was a side piece.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.453
<i> And I was going to be like,</i>
<i> what's the tea, bitches?</i>

21:29.522 --> 21:30.955
<i> - You got some boxes, boo.</i>

21:31.024 --> 21:32.757
- Ma'am?
- Ma'am?

21:32.825 --> 21:34.058
- Ooh, it smells good in here.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.961
Yummy salad.

21:37.030 --> 21:40.564
- So I need all the tea
on that lunch.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.733
- Well, it went smooth,
thank God.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.702
So she didn't come in hot,
which was nice.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.337
- Yeah.
- Good.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.105
- Well, we owned up to, like,

21:48.174 --> 21:49.273
we shouldn't
have done the tweet.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.374
Like, that was,
like, immature of us.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.375
- Yeah.
- It was stupid.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.643
Like, what are we, 12?

21:52.712 --> 21:53.811
- She's like,
"You should have came to me."

21:53.880 --> 21:54.879
- Which is true.

21:54.947 --> 21:55.880
Like, why didn't
we just go to her?

21:55.948 --> 21:57.114
- "And you should
have texted me."

21:57.183 --> 21:58.215
- But I think at that point,
we were just,

21:58.284 --> 21:59.483
like, we got caught
in the moment.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.185
That was because we got,
like, riled up.

22:01.254 --> 22:03.154
- Riled up isn't the word.

22:03.222 --> 22:06.157
When, like, Mike was sending
all those recordings in group,

22:06.225 --> 22:09.226
I was, like, [bleep] floored.

22:09.295 --> 22:12.330
- Yeah, and then, you know,
she was just telling us

22:12.398 --> 22:13.631
she's mad at Mike,

22:13.700 --> 22:16.634
and she feels like
Mike is backpedaling.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.436
He's, like, talking to her,
but then, like,

22:18.504 --> 22:21.272
trying to get us all riled up
and not like her.

22:21.374 --> 22:22.807
And then, like,
Mike talks to her

22:22.875 --> 22:24.975
and says he doesn't want any,
like, bad blood or whatever.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.577
- And I was like, oh,
we didn't know you guys

22:26.646 --> 22:28.979
were talking and, like, okay.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.148
- While at the same time
telling us everything?

22:31.217 --> 22:32.249
- It's very confusing.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.984
- You're a switch hitter, bro.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.855
You cannot be [bleep] talking
to us and be nice to the person

22:37.924 --> 22:39.290
that you're [bleep] talking.

22:39.359 --> 22:42.727
I won't stand for that
because that's fake as [bleep].

22:42.795 --> 22:45.763
Didn't Old Bridge post
something under Mike's tweet?

22:45.832 --> 22:47.131
- So that's also
what she showed.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.632
- Yeah.
- She showed all that?

22:48.701 --> 22:51.502
- "So you can DM,
and we can start this party."

22:51.571 --> 22:53.003
- Let's start this party?

22:53.072 --> 22:55.406
Why are you calling it a party?

22:55.475 --> 22:57.608
- And Angelina has
all that saved?

22:57.677 --> 22:59.176
- She screen grabbed all of it.

22:59.245 --> 23:01.245
- My problem with him is,
why the [bleep]

23:01.314 --> 23:02.947
are you pretending
to be her friend then?

23:03.015 --> 23:05.950
Why are you trying
to expose her,

23:06.018 --> 23:07.385
and then be friends with her?

23:07.453 --> 23:09.754
Like, why is your wife
telling me to unfollow her?

23:09.822 --> 23:12.523
- So Lauren texts you
to unfollow?

23:12.592 --> 23:14.158
- Unfollow the dirty
little hamster.

23:14.227 --> 23:17.161
And I was drunk
on my couch like, okay.

23:17.230 --> 23:21.565
Angelina blocked
Lauren and I on Stories.

23:21.634 --> 23:25.336
So one day, Laurens asked me
to block Angelina.

23:25.438 --> 23:26.704
And I said, "Sure, why not?"

23:26.773 --> 23:28.506
<i> But then less</i>
<i> than a week later,</i>

23:28.574 --> 23:31.542
Mike invited Angelina
to the launch party.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.178
- I'm gonna do
a skin care launch party.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.279
- Okay.

23:35.348 --> 23:36.514
- But since Angelina
blocked me--

23:36.582 --> 23:37.715
- Yeah.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.351
- Should I invite someone
who blocked me?

23:40.453 --> 23:42.219
- Just send the invite
as a gesture.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.487
She doesn't have to accept it.

23:43.556 --> 23:44.755
She doesn't have to come.

23:44.824 --> 23:47.391
I'm also going
to send her the invite

23:47.460 --> 23:49.493
because it's really coming
from us as a family,

23:49.562 --> 23:52.062
that we made the decision
to invite her.

23:52.131 --> 23:55.733
- I just feel like playing
both sides, it backfires,

23:55.802 --> 23:58.803
and I just--I don't want
to deal with that negativity.

23:58.871 --> 23:59.970
- So messy.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.173
- The fact that
there's so much drama

24:02.241 --> 24:04.175
<i> with Angelina and Mike,</i>

24:04.243 --> 24:06.777
<i> and then Lauren saying</i>
<i> to block her,</i>

24:06.846 --> 24:08.679
and then you invite her
to the skin care launch,

24:08.748 --> 24:09.880
is just being a fake friend.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.348
It's just so messy.

24:11.417 --> 24:14.452
- He can't hide behind
his positive quotes anymore.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.420
Like, people are gonna
start seeing through it.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.789
<i> - I'll say it</i>
<i> to everybody as a group too.</i>

24:18.858 --> 24:21.559
When somebody says that I
did something, come to me.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.160
- I agree.
You know what?

24:23.229 --> 24:25.162
- Don't believe everything
you hear from others.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.831
- I'm glad you said that.
- Like, ask me.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.332
I'm probably gonna
tell you the truth

24:28.401 --> 24:29.567
because I got diarrhea
of the mouth.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.968
- Yeah.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.470
I feel that after the fact,
I'm like, oh, my God,

24:32.538 --> 24:35.072
I can't believe, like,
I went down this rabbit hole.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.907
If I could rewind the tape,

24:36.976 --> 24:39.243
I probably wouldn't pick up
the phone call this time.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.744
- I'm glad
that you see that now.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.046
- Obviously,
the old Mike would probably

24:42.114 --> 24:44.181
love to be thrown in that mix.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.050
- I feel like the old Mike's
in there somewhere.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.084
- [laughs]

24:47.153 --> 24:48.319
<i> - Mike is so [bleep] nosy.</i>

24:48.387 --> 24:49.520
<i> Like, this is who he is.</i>

24:49.589 --> 24:52.122
He wanted
to hear the dirt on me.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.290
- He's in there.
- Yeah.

24:53.359 --> 24:54.925
- It's like, hi, old Mike.
- Yeah--oh, God.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.361
- So he [bleep] knew
damn well what

24:57.430 --> 24:59.129
Chris was calling him for,
please.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.364
- I, like, entertained it.

25:00.433 --> 25:01.699
I'm like, oh, [bleep],
I don't like this.

25:01.767 --> 25:03.000
And I come back.
- Yeah.

25:03.069 --> 25:04.034
You were like a crab
coming out of a shell.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.402
And it comes out,

25:05.471 --> 25:06.770
and then it sees somebody
walking past, it's like...

25:06.839 --> 25:07.771
- Yeah.
- It goes back in.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.772
- Yeah.
- That was you.

25:08.841 --> 25:09.773
Hopefully, in the future,

25:09.842 --> 25:10.875
he will never do it again,

25:10.943 --> 25:11.909
and he learned
something from this.

25:11.978 --> 25:12.910
I really, really
really hope so.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.311
- I've cheated
on my diet twice

25:14.380 --> 25:16.113
in the past two days
because I've been stressed out.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.681
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.550
<i> - I think he was backpedaling.</i>

25:19.619 --> 25:21.285
Because I think he realized
he was in too deep.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.187
And he was like,
oh, [bleep], how do I fix this?

25:23.256 --> 25:25.289
- You girls are cool, right?

25:25.358 --> 25:27.725
- Yeah, we're good
with Angelina now.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.227
For some reason, she thought
you were more involved in it.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.862
- Always.
- I was like--

25:31.931 --> 25:33.631
- Oh, yeah,
she grilled us for a second.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.065
- And I was like, no--
- I was like, girl, no.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.167
- I promise you--
- But why did she think that?

25:37.236 --> 25:38.435
Did Mike give her a reason?

25:38.504 --> 25:39.937
- But that's what I'm saying.
I don't know.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.873
- I got really upset
when he texted last night.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.842
- I'm wondering if he's
trying to make Angelina

25:44.911 --> 25:46.310
think Jenni was involved.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.845
- I don't even know
what the [bleep] I did,

25:47.914 --> 25:49.580
but I'm always
the one to blame.

25:49.649 --> 25:52.650
Mike texts,
"What a disaster this was."

25:52.718 --> 25:54.351
And then I was like,
"What happened?"

25:54.420 --> 25:56.120
And he goes, "Four hours
of her playing the victim."

25:56.188 --> 25:57.454
I go, "Oh, my God."

25:57.523 --> 25:59.390
And he goes, "It's all
me and Jenni's fault."

25:59.458 --> 26:01.892
And that's
when I [bleep] lost it.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.928
He wouldn't say why
it was my fault.

26:03.996 --> 26:06.096
- Maybe it was, like,
him just trying to stir you up.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.164
- All he did--
- And why?

26:07.233 --> 26:08.399
- Was made me shut down.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.968
- Mike is, like,
trying to, like,

26:11.037 --> 26:15.506
fix his problem by throwing
other people under the bus.

26:15.575 --> 26:19.143
And that is not how
you fix a problem here.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.578
<i> Us girls aren't the issue.</i>

26:20.646 --> 26:24.081
- I don't know how to move
forward with him right now.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.717
Because I don't like
when someone plays both sides.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.319
- I'll be honest,
the last two days

26:28.387 --> 26:29.954
have been eye-opening, really.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.890
- You have no idea what
the other side is saying.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.625
And that makes me so paranoid.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.794
- I think we're gonna
concentrate on your happiness

26:36.862 --> 26:37.861
and taking it one day
at a time, right?

26:37.930 --> 26:39.330
- That's all I got to do.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.832

27:21.974 --> 27:23.374
a seating area for the guests.

27:23.442 --> 27:25.809

27:38.324 --> 27:40.157

None.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.393

he came to my house.

28:32.311 --> 28:36.146
It was, like,
literally pulling teeth

28:36.215 --> 28:38.916
for me to get him to admit
his wrong in anything.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.643
and it's "Hi, Angelina,
you're invited to this,"

36:53.712 --> 36:54.744
another way.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.246
- I think you're looking
too much into it.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.814
- But that's how I just feel.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.583
- I think I'm more upset
with that you would think

36:59.651 --> 37:01.151
that I would say anything
negative about you

37:01.220 --> 37:02.252
since all we've been through.

37:02.321 --> 37:05.355
- Not negative about me,
but lie.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.257
You don't know what
other people are saying,

37:07.326 --> 37:11.828
so you have to trust
the other people in your life

37:11.897 --> 37:13.863
to hold you in high regard.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.665
So finding that out yesterday,

37:15.734 --> 37:18.235
knowing that my name
is being brought up,

37:18.303 --> 37:20.136
that brings me back
to the speech--

37:20.205 --> 37:21.504
- Yeah.
- All over again.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.940
And it's terrifying.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.875
That [bleep] ruined--
- I know.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.544
- My life for a year.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.145
I didn't leave my house.

37:29.214 --> 37:30.380
- Yeah.

37:30.449 --> 37:33.016
<i> [tense music]</i>

37:33.085 --> 37:35.318

I need to take a step back

37:35.387 --> 37:37.587
because it's
affecting my whole life,

37:37.656 --> 37:39.422
because I don't know
what Angelina

37:39.491 --> 37:41.157

37:41.226 --> 37:43.927
I'm at an age and a point

37:57.242 --> 37:59.876
When you don't know what other

37:59.945 --> 38:01.978
it's really [bleep] painful.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.684

38:17.829 --> 38:18.895
- Fine.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.230
- I'm understanding
your concerns.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.564
You have the right
to feel that way.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.700
But I try not to speak
negative about anyone.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.102
I had to do
some soul-searching recently.

38:26.171 --> 38:27.871
And it was hard for me
to reconcile on how

38:27.939 --> 38:31.841
to even operate, on how
I was gonna deal with it.

38:31.910 --> 38:36.046
And that's--is what
happened with me, okay?

38:36.114 --> 38:38.782
Now, the other
stuff with Lauren,

38:38.850 --> 38:40.784
and the blocking,
and you guys,

38:40.852 --> 38:43.219
that's probably
another conversation.

38:43.288 --> 38:45.021
I need to handle
one problem a day.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.790
- Yeah, no kidding.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.425

to Romeo.

38:48.493 --> 38:49.793
- Okay.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.127
- But it's not--I don't think
it's that serious.

38:51.196 --> 38:53.296
I think it's
really just communication.

38:53.365 --> 38:56.032

it's an issue, you know?

39:01.073 --> 39:02.439
All right, thank you

39:02.507 --> 39:03.973

At the end of the day,

And the mediation is bringing
two parties together.
