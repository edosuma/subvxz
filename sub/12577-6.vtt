(nancy)
here you go, sug'.

00:44.511 --> 00:47.297
2 sugs, right?
Uh-huh.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.632
They asked me to be
the celebrity judge

00:49.632 --> 00:52.602
at the Mrs. Heimlich
county beauty pageant next week.

00:52.602 --> 00:54.104
Mrs.? Wait.

00:54.104 --> 00:56.106
Do any women mature enough
to have a family

00:56.106 --> 00:57.891
really go in for that nonsense?

00:57.891 --> 01:00.693
That nonsense, sug',changed my life.

01:00.693 --> 01:02.062
It's what got me
into television

01:02.062 --> 01:05.065
and into hundreds of homes every night
as a weather analyst.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.485
You'd be surprised at the topnotch prizes
at the Mrs. Heimlich.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.486
Bath beads?

01:09.486 --> 01:11.204
Try a year's lease
on a brand-new

01:11.204 --> 01:14.040
chevy silverado
ltk 1500 pickup truck

01:14.040 --> 01:18.461
with a super cab and 270 horsepower,
5.3-liter vortec v-8.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.664
I want that truck.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.501
Hank, do you think
I could win

01:24.501 --> 01:26.503
the Mrs. Heimlich
pageant if I entered?

01:26.503 --> 01:28.004
[gasps]

01:28.004 --> 01:29.005
you see, peggy,

01:29.005 --> 01:31.925
that's what you call
a loaded question.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.093
No matter how I answer,

01:33.093 --> 01:35.095
there's a bullet
in every chamber

01:35.095 --> 01:37.263
designed to blow
my brains out.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.732
Hank, do you think
I can win?

01:40.733 --> 01:42.735
Well, uh,

01:42.735 --> 01:46.739
I think you're beautiful
and smart,

01:46.739 --> 01:49.659
and you don't need to enter
some pageant to prove it.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.078
Hah, you don't think
I can win, do you?

01:52.078 --> 01:53.580
I didn't say...

01:53.580 --> 01:54.697
[stammering]

01:54.697 --> 01:57.700
I just don't think
you're the pageant type.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.702
Really?
Well, let's see.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.705
.
All you have to be
is married and over 23

02:02.705 --> 02:04.207
well, I've got
that covered.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.708
So, how would we rate me?

02:05.708 --> 02:09.711
Uh, I would say
face: "a" minus,

02:09.711 --> 02:12.215
body: "b" plus,

02:12.215 --> 02:14.717
personality: "a" plus,

02:14.717 --> 02:17.103
and brains: "a" plus.

02:17.103 --> 02:21.107
So with my smarts,
and looks,
and muchos talentos,

02:21.107 --> 02:23.610
well, I think I have
a huge edge over
these bimbos, hank.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.028
I'm gonna enter.

02:25.028 --> 02:27.030
The grand priz
e is a truck.

02:27.030 --> 02:28.031
I have a truck.

02:28.531 --> 02:29.532
But I don't.

02:29.532 --> 02:31.034
You have a car.

02:31.034 --> 02:34.037
.
Hank, a car is fine,
but a truck is a force

02:35.038 --> 02:35.822
true.

02:36.706 --> 02:37.707
[luanne screaming]

02:38.208 --> 02:39.709
e
I can't believ
e I'm going to b

02:40.210 --> 02:42.712
an actual beauty
pageant stylist!

02:42.712 --> 02:43.713
oh!

02:43.713 --> 02:46.716
I already have some ideas
for styling you.

02:46.716 --> 02:48.551
I've always wondered
what would happen

02:48.551 --> 02:50.920
if you let
your hair dry naturally.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.139
Ok, let's not go
crazy, luanne.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.141
Remember,
we're working together

02:55.141 --> 02:57.894
to make the best
peggy hill possible.

02:57.894 --> 02:59.979
Personally,
I think a little lipstick

02:59.979 --> 03:03.516
and a pair of nice earrings
will win that truck.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.518
That's a good-looking
truck, hank.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.520
d
I'm talking
about them dang ol

03:07.520 --> 03:09.022
s
270 horsepower,
man old skid plate

03:09.022 --> 03:11.024
and z-71 off-road
suspension, man,

03:11.024 --> 03:14.327
and dang old k-5,
man. Dang.

03:14.327 --> 03:17.163
Yeah, all peggy's gotta do
to get that truck

03:17.664 --> 03:19.999
is to win
the Mrs. Heimlich
county pageant.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.868
[birds chirping]

03:21.868 --> 03:24.170
[children chattering]

03:24.170 --> 03:25.171
y-yep.

03:26.673 --> 03:27.957
yep.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.259
That's right. Yep.

03:29.259 --> 03:30.760
Peggy's gonna win.

03:31.261 --> 03:32.762
She's every man's fantasy.

03:32.762 --> 03:35.765
Uh, ok, bill,
i'll take over
from here.

03:35.765 --> 03:38.768
I mean,
she's got an a-plus brain
and an a-minus body

03:39.269 --> 03:41.020
but if she wears
one of them
push-up brassieres,

03:41.354 --> 03:42.522
bill!

03:42.522 --> 03:45.525
She'll have a body
that just won't quit.

03:47.777 --> 03:49.395
You like that truck,
don't you?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.898
Would you like
to take it for
a test drive?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.199
Well, I would not
say no.

03:55.985 --> 03:57.487
Now here's something

03:57.487 --> 03:59.489
a pretty lady
like yourself
will appreciate:

03:59.989 --> 04:02.659
a driver's side
vanity mirror.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.794
Mmm. I do look good
in this truck.

04:04.794 --> 04:09.332
So, what's it gonna take
for you to buy
this truck today?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.417
Oh, I'm not planning
on buying it.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.803
I'm planning on winning it
in a beauty contest.

04:13.803 --> 04:15.505
Test drive's over.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.595
[people chattering]

04:22.929 --> 04:26.015
(coordinator)
excuse me, y'all,
before we get started,

04:26.015 --> 04:29.519
if there is anybody here
not connected to the pageant,

04:29.519 --> 04:31.821
could you please leave now?

04:32.772 --> 04:34.490
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

04:38.995 --> 04:40.997
Um, I'd like
to welcome you all

04:41.497 --> 04:44.500
to the Mrs. Heimlich
county beauty pageant.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.752
In a couple of minutes,

04:45.752 --> 04:48.254
you'll get the chance to meet
your fellow contestants.

04:48.254 --> 04:49.589
But before you do,

04:49.589 --> 04:52.091
,
the reigning Mrs. Heimlich

04:52.091 --> 04:54.844
cathy shears,
would like to say
a few words.

04:54.844 --> 04:57.547
[crowd applauding]

05:01.050 --> 05:03.553
what a long, strange,
beautiful trip it's been.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.556
And next week,
I will add the word
"sad" to that list

05:06.556 --> 05:09.058
because I'll be
handing over this crown

05:09.058 --> 05:11.227
to the new
mrs. Heimlich county.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.528
Peggy hill.

05:12.528 --> 05:14.447
[women chattering]

05:15.448 --> 05:17.950
.
well, hello,
i'm peggy hill

05:17.950 --> 05:19.986
oh, hi, I'm helen pell.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.488
So, what does
peggy hill do

05:22.488 --> 05:24.490
when she's not competing
in a beauty pageant?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.492
Well, I'm
a substitute teacher

05:26.492 --> 05:27.794
at tom landry
middle school.

05:28.211 --> 05:29.212
Oh, really?

05:29.212 --> 05:32.215
I teach sciences full-time
over at the high school.

05:32.215 --> 05:33.049
What do you teach?

05:33.466 --> 05:34.384
Espa-nol.

05:34.384 --> 05:35.885
I had my 2nd honeymoon
in spain.

05:35.885 --> 05:37.387
Have you ever gone?

05:37.804 --> 05:39.672
No. But it's because
I choose not to.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.642
You should go.
You'll love it!

05:42.642 --> 05:44.644
I practically lived there
for a couple of months

05:44.644 --> 05:46.646
after I graduated
from college.

05:46.646 --> 05:49.515
That's where I met
my husband,
the engineer.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.267
The kind
that drives a train?

05:51.567 --> 05:53.569
[laughing]

05:53.569 --> 05:55.571
oh, I'm gonna have
to look out for you.

05:56.072 --> 05:57.357
You're very congenial.

05:59.075 --> 06:00.410
(woman #1)
oh, really?

06:00.410 --> 06:01.911
s
You know
that there are
3 other contestant

06:02.412 --> 06:03.413
who teach as well?

06:03.413 --> 06:05.415
Yes, yes, I know.
I met them already.

06:05.915 --> 06:06.916
And I suppose
you're, what,

06:07.417 --> 06:08.418
a biochemist
or something?

06:08.918 --> 06:09.919
.
Oh, no, no, no

06:10.420 --> 06:11.704
i'm a stay-at-home
mother.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.206
But I have 7 kids,

06:13.206 --> 06:15.708
so that's a full-time job
in and of itself.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.377
Do you have
any children?

06:17.377 --> 06:18.878
8.

06:18.878 --> 06:22.215
No, I only have one.

06:22.465 --> 06:26.018
Well, right now,
i'm majoring in philosophy
and classical music.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.804
Oh, how nice for you.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.806
That'll get you
a job in a factory
when you get out of college.

06:29.806 --> 06:30.857
[giggling]

06:30.857 --> 06:32.725
that's what my mom says, too.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.727
[chuckling]

06:34.727 --> 06:36.729
you do know
you have to be 23 years

06:36.729 --> 06:38.114
or older to be
in this pageant?

06:38.564 --> 06:40.483
I am 23.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.201
Do you have
any children?

06:42.201 --> 06:43.986
No, I'm concentrating on my--

06:43.986 --> 06:45.488
Oh, well, I have one.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.156
Anyway, nice meeting you.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.491
Good luck in the pageant.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.882
(woman #2)

06:55.882 --> 06:57.884
[all chattering]

06:57.884 --> 06:59.419

07:00.002 --> 07:01.337

she looks so good.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.423
Isn't this exciting,
aunt peggy?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.425
.
Everyone's so nice

07:05.425 --> 07:09.395
mrs. Heimlich county
let me try on
her crown and sash.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.814
Did you know she could pla
y the lap steel guitar?

07:11.814 --> 07:13.316
,
And she only has
9 percent body fat

07:13.816 --> 07:15.318
.
and it's all
in her breasts

07:24.577 --> 07:25.912
[squeaking]

07:26.863 --> 07:28.364
[sighs]

07:32.251 --> 07:34.921
little bobby hill.
You rascal, you.

07:35.421 --> 07:36.289
(peggy)
mmm.

07:36.756 --> 07:38.508
that's when you
used to put
your food everywhere

07:38.508 --> 07:39.509
but in your mouth.

07:40.009 --> 07:42.378
I was young.
I didn't know
any better.

07:42.378 --> 07:45.131
Oh, I haven't seen
this photo
in such a long time.

07:45.515 --> 07:46.883
Who is that kissing dad?

07:47.350 --> 07:48.851
Well, that's me, honey.

07:48.851 --> 07:50.937
.
Really?
You were beautiful

07:51.103 --> 07:53.890
were?
Oh, bobby, I still am.

07:55.191 --> 07:56.225
ok.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.528
Bobby, don't you see?
When you look at me now,

07:58.528 --> 08:00.530
you can't see somebody
who's beautiful.

08:00.530 --> 08:02.532
You just see a mother.

08:02.532 --> 08:05.034
I don't know.
I think connie's
mom is beautiful.

08:05.034 --> 08:06.285
And Mrs. Gribble--

08:06.285 --> 08:07.286
All right. All right.

08:07.787 --> 08:09.288
Hey, there's me standing

08:09.288 --> 08:11.290
.
next to the world'
s largest roadrunner

08:11.290 --> 08:12.792
are you still having
those nightmares

08:12.792 --> 08:14.293
where he pecks out
your eyes?

08:14.877 --> 08:16.462
I forgot about those.

08:16.462 --> 08:17.463
Good.

08:23.970 --> 08:24.971
[moans]

08:25.972 --> 08:26.973
[sighing]

08:27.473 --> 08:28.474
[sighs]

08:28.975 --> 08:30.476
peggy, are you all right?

08:30.977 --> 08:32.477
Oh, hank, I can't sleep.

08:34.730 --> 08:36.232
[gun firing on t.v.]

08:36.232 --> 08:38.985
boy, cagney and lacey
certainly have
aged horribly.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.352
[tires screeching on t.v.]

08:40.352 --> 08:42.855
hank, do you think
i'll turn into
one of those women

08:42.855 --> 08:43.856
you see at
the mega lo mart

08:43.856 --> 08:45.858
s
who wears
white stretch pant

08:45.858 --> 08:47.610
and doesn't tuck I
n her shirt anymore?

08:48.611 --> 08:50.446
Not for many, many years.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.748
Oh, so you've thought
about this?

08:53.165 --> 08:54.166
[sighing]

08:54.166 --> 08:55.167
[bobby shrieking]

08:55.167 --> 08:58.170
(bobby)
no, not my eyes!

08:58.170 --> 09:01.173
I thought he stopped
having those nightmares.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.378
Come on in, ladies.
Take a load off.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.546
Thanks.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.381
Well, I don't believe
I've had the pleasure

09:08.381 --> 09:09.966
of meeting
this little filly before.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.968
Well, yes.
Yes, you have.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.469
Mmm-hmm.
Your daughter?

09:13.469 --> 09:15.888
No, she's my niece
, luanne.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.729

What can old buck strickland
do for you?

09:24.280 --> 09:27.283
You said you had some kind of
business proposition,
did you?

09:27.783 --> 09:28.868
Mr. Strickland,

09:28.868 --> 09:31.871
y
a beauty pageant
can be a good
promotional opportunit

09:31.871 --> 09:33.956
for both
the beauty contestant

09:33.956 --> 09:35.958
and for the business
who sponsors the--

09:35.958 --> 09:36.959
Say no more.
I'll do it.

09:36.959 --> 09:38.294
How much do you need?

09:38.294 --> 09:40.796
Well, there's the new

09:41.297 --> 09:44.300

new dress, hair...

09:44.300 --> 09:46.802
Uh, we figure
around $2,000.

09:46.802 --> 09:48.304
Mmm-hmm.

09:48.304 --> 09:51.807
Debbie,

for $2,000.

09:51.807 --> 09:52.808

Oh, thank you,
mr. Strickland

09:54.977 --> 09:58.064

I guarantee you
that I will win
that Mrs. Heimlich pageant

09:58.064 --> 10:00.066

terrific, girls.
Mrs. Hill, that was awful.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.135
We're gonna go again,

mrs. Hill to sit
this one out

10:38.471 --> 10:39.972

10:47.063 --> 10:49.065
"you look wonderful!"

10:49.065 --> 10:50.566
thanks, sug'.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.285
By the way,
I was so excited to hear
that you entered the pageant.

10:53.619 --> 10:55.154
Really? Oh, thank you.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.155
Well, maybe this year

10:56.656 --> 10:57.657
p
you and I
can shake things u

10:57.657 --> 10:59.709
a little bit
at the mrs.

10:59.709 --> 11:00.710
Shake things up how?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.662
Well, you know,
every year they pick

11:02.662 --> 11:04.664
the same type
of woman to win.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.966
Skinny, big hair,
bleached blonde--

11:07.333 --> 11:08.668
You mean women like me?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.971
Oh, your hair
is not bleached,
is it?

11:12.755 --> 11:13.756
What type of woman

11:13.756 --> 11:15.591
do you think should win
the pageant, peggy?

11:16.092 --> 11:17.593
Well, I'm not a judge,

11:17.593 --> 11:19.595
but a married woman,
of course.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.097
Not just a wife,
but a partner.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.598
Definitely a mother.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.101
Someone who is distinguished
by her brain size,

11:25.101 --> 11:26.602
not her bra size.

11:26.602 --> 11:27.937
Women like you.

11:28.070 --> 11:30.906
Well, you said it,
I didn't. But, yes.

11:30.906 --> 11:33.275
I think women like you
shouldn't be in a pageant

11:33.743 --> 11:36.912
if you're not prepared
to be judged by women
like me.

11:38.748 --> 11:41.250
We could have
shook things up,
you and me!

11:42.752 --> 11:43.836

don't you look...smart.

Luanne, I think I wanna put
some highlights in my hair.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.551
oh!

11:58.551 --> 12:00.352
You don't think
that's a good idea?

12:00.686 --> 12:02.188
No, it's a good idea.

12:02.188 --> 12:05.191
It's just that highlights
was a 2-part class,

12:05.691 --> 12:08.527
and I missed both parts.

Hey, bozo!

you think your missis
will like it?

Yes, sir.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.553
Well, I hope so.

12:34.553 --> 12:36.555
This is the most
I've spent on a woman

12:36.555 --> 12:38.057
without getting
anything in return,

12:38.557 --> 12:40.392
if you know
what I mean.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.094
Uh, don't worry
about it, buck.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.180
You've backed a winner.

at least.

by 8:00 tonight,

12:52.438 --> 12:55.441
I can have
my stretch pants
by tomorrow at noon.

I could be
in them by 1:00.

Uh, peggy,
why don't you
just wait a week,

12:59.945 --> 13:01.447
and we can drive over
to the mega lo mart

13:01.447 --> 13:03.449
and get 'em in
your new truck, huh?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.951
Yeah, right,
my new truck.

[laughing]

13:08.954 --> 13:10.673

You've got those
fancy stripes
in your hair,

are not talking right now.

uh, hey, dale,

13:35.147 --> 13:37.650
peggy baked
some extra brownies,

"you know who
might enjoy these?

13:39.151 --> 13:41.320
The gribbles."

to me yesterday.

sit down for a second,
please.

a professional

r beauty pageant,

amateur performance.

a professional.

as your stylist.

14:51.056 --> 14:54.860
No. You will still be
a very important part
of team peggy hill

14:55.227 --> 14:57.479

smaller capacity.

if I did.

to cheat on me, hank.

I won't tell peggy.

I just spent 2 hours

18:15.561 --> 18:18.430
picking one of peggy's shoes
out of that disposal.

18:18.897 --> 18:20.816
I'm beginning to think
it wasn't an accident.

18:20.816 --> 18:23.318
Uh, why aren't you
at the pageant?

18:23.819 --> 18:26.605
Peggy went with
buck strickland.
I'm going a little later.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.108

did she fire you, too?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.609
Because, you know,
she fired me.

I heard you were
still an important part

I know you're feeling
a little miffed.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.921
But you have to understand
your aunt has always had

18:42.921 --> 18:45.424
a lot of confidence
about her looks,
which is good.

18:45.424 --> 18:48.177
But now she's got herself
in kind of a bind.

18:48.177 --> 18:50.179
She's either got
to admit to herself

18:50.179 --> 18:52.598
she can't win the truck,
and quit,

18:52.598 --> 18:56.552
or stay in the pageant
and, well, probably lose.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.637
Either way,
it's gonna hurt.

18:58.637 --> 19:02.141
Well, I guess
I should feel bad
for her,

19:03.142 --> 19:04.526

out there like this.

something wrong?

it's dragging
on the floor.

Fix it!

[contestants sneering]

20:22.554 --> 20:25.607

this wasn't premium,
you cheap bastard.

20:28.277 --> 20:29.728
[stuttering]

20:29.728 --> 20:32.981
helen, by any chance,
do you have any
spare tape?

20:33.482 --> 20:34.983
My ass has come loose.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.818
I'm sure
it's just the humidity.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.321
Peggy, I-I've got
to go inside.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.323

I should tell you

20:41.323 --> 20:43.542

t to put on
your shoes.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.899
Wh-what are you doing?

21:08.183 --> 21:09.685
Well, I figured

21:09.685 --> 21:11.687
since you were only
doing this for the truck,

21:11.687 --> 21:13.605
i'd save you the trouble.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.407
Honey,
you bought us
a new truck?

21:15.774 --> 21:17.776

my old one.

aunt peggy.

22:02.487 --> 22:03.455
Well, even if
you don't, luanne,

22:03.955 --> 22:04.956
