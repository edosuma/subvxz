<i>Suits</i>

00:01.257 --> 00:03.203
Katrina Bennett said she'd put
the deal through

00:03.204 --> 00:04.205
if you offered her a job.

00:04.322 --> 00:05.322
You bribed her.

00:05.323 --> 00:06.973
You bet your ass
I did.

00:06.974 --> 00:08.942
I decided
to farm out the case.

00:08.943 --> 00:11.612
Let me guess--
Daniel Hardman.

00:11.613 --> 00:13.664
He's baiting you
into breaching confidentiality.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.949
And I'm ready to bite down
and drag him in with me.

00:15.950 --> 00:17.918
She was younger than you,
prettier than you,

00:17.919 --> 00:19.503
and of child-bearing age--

00:19.504 --> 00:23.123
all of the things you are not,
and you fired her for it.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.824
You can't be
the named defendant

00:24.825 --> 00:26.660
on a gender-discrimination case

00:26.661 --> 00:29.179
while we're suing Folsom Foods
for the same thing.

00:29.180 --> 00:31.965
I am not capitulating
to that man.

00:31.966 --> 00:34.885
You have 45 cases
you can't afford.

00:34.886 --> 00:37.638
Any way you slice it,
I'm going to bleed you dry.

00:37.639 --> 00:39.690
I put my reputation
on the line to close Maria.

00:39.691 --> 00:44.228
- Sheila, please.
- I think you should go.

00:44.229 --> 00:46.146
Meet Ms. Dana Scott.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.281
- Scottie.
- Harvey.

00:47.282 --> 00:48.315
Oh, you two
know each other?

00:48.316 --> 00:49.900
We went to Harvard Law
together.

00:49.901 --> 00:51.985
I've been here longer
than 75% of our associates,

00:51.986 --> 00:53.186
and I love it,

00:53.187 --> 00:54.738
and that's what I told them
in my essay.

00:54.739 --> 00:56.206
I'm going to Harvard.

00:56.207 --> 00:59.042
When I get back to London,
I'm getting married, Harvey.

00:59.043 --> 01:00.544
What would you like me
to say?

01:02.997 --> 01:06.049
I'm Hanley Folsom,
President of Folsom Foods.

01:06.050 --> 01:09.002
Recently we've been victim
to terrible allegations

01:09.003 --> 01:11.255
that we've been discriminating
against women.

01:11.256 --> 01:13.507
We're in places
like Marysville,

01:13.508 --> 01:16.710
places where women want
more than just jobs.

01:16.711 --> 01:20.681
They want homes, families,
and we support that.

01:20.682 --> 01:23.517
And if they want advancement,
we support that too.

01:23.518 --> 01:24.518
Got to give it to him.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.602
His food might suck,

01:25.603 --> 01:27.387
but he makes
a mean bullshit pie.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.189
Okay, please don't put
that image in my mind.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.390
I'm eating.
Thank you.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.193
What've you got there--
vomit bagel...

01:33.194 --> 01:35.245
Feces pancakes?

01:35.246 --> 01:36.580
Look, I don't care
what he says.

01:36.581 --> 01:38.115
This is a man
who won't promote women.

01:38.116 --> 01:39.666
I want to steal a page
from your book.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.785
I already checked. There's
no hot-mic footage from this.

01:41.786 --> 01:43.086
Then interview
the cameraman

01:43.087 --> 01:44.738
or the sound guy,
whatever it takes.

01:44.739 --> 01:46.089
We need to catch this guy
in a lie.

01:46.090 --> 01:48.091
I already tried
to hire an investigator.

01:48.092 --> 01:49.710
The authorization
got kicked back.

01:49.711 --> 01:52.212
Do it anyway.
I'll take care of it.

01:52.213 --> 01:55.382
We need to talk
about resources.

01:55.383 --> 01:56.850
We do.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.585
I hear clients' calls
aren't being returned.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.087
Hardman put seven cases
on the fast track.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.422
The rest have to take
a backseat.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.274
We can't just hang our clients
out to dry.

02:04.275 --> 02:05.525
We won't.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.644
At 10:00 a.m.,
the library will be packed.

02:07.645 --> 02:10.062
Instead of returning
113 calls,

02:10.064 --> 02:11.148
I'm going
to take an hour

02:11.149 --> 02:12.566
and give them
the state of the union.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.284
- Oh, good.
- Not good enough.

02:14.285 --> 02:16.153
I need 40 more
contract lawyers,

02:16.154 --> 02:17.321
a dozen paralegals,

02:17.322 --> 02:18.572
and Mike Ross just told me

02:18.573 --> 02:20.240
he couldn't even hire
an investigator.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.274
That's right.
He can't.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.709
- We have to.
- No.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.078
- We need to invest in this.
- Did you hear me?

02:25.079 --> 02:27.280
We bit this off.
We need to chew.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.115
You're like a toddler.
No.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.084
All of these are bills.

02:31.085 --> 02:32.919
We knew what we were
getting into.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.621
And then we took a hit
from Monica Eton

02:34.622 --> 02:36.122
and hired
the contract lawyers.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.123
We are out of money.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.092
Use the line
of credit.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.594
It's gone.

02:40.595 --> 02:43.647
What?

02:43.648 --> 02:46.733
They have evaluated
the situation,

02:46.734 --> 02:48.185
and they know we're bleeding.

02:48.186 --> 02:51.772
So we've got seven cases
in seven cities

02:51.773 --> 02:54.140
over the next two months.

02:54.141 --> 02:57.611
So what are you
proposing I do?

02:57.612 --> 03:01.748
Okay, what do you have
for me?

03:01.749 --> 03:02.949
Rachel.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.334
Rachel?

03:04.335 --> 03:06.169
What's going on?
What are you doing?

03:06.170 --> 03:08.255
- I'm working.
- On what?

03:08.256 --> 03:10.007
One of the seven cases
is in Massapequa,

03:10.008 --> 03:11.792
so I'm seeing
if one of the cities nearby

03:11.793 --> 03:13.293
might have
a private investigator.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.295
Okay, so that's a map
of Boston.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.298
You're on what we commonly
refer to as the Internet.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.499
And then, up here,

03:19.500 --> 03:21.301
you would just write
"private investigator."

03:21.302 --> 03:22.686
But then
I wouldn't be able to see

03:22.687 --> 03:24.388
what part of town
I want to live in

03:24.389 --> 03:27.024
when I go to Harvard.

03:27.025 --> 03:29.393
Okay, so basically
you haven't been working

03:29.394 --> 03:32.178
for the last, what,
15 minutes?

03:32.179 --> 03:34.231
Half hour...

03:34.232 --> 03:35.282
45 minutes.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.349
- Come on.
- I am sorry.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.701
I don't deal well
with waiting.

03:37.702 --> 03:40.287
You've done everything
that you can do, all right?

03:40.288 --> 03:41.455
You killed the LSATs.

03:41.456 --> 03:43.707
You had a great interview.
You're a legacy.

03:43.708 --> 03:45.158
You're smoking hot.

03:45.159 --> 03:46.493
They don't let people in
because they're hot.

03:46.494 --> 03:47.994
I would.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.697
You do realize we're working
on a gender-discrimination case.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.198
That's what I'm doing--
working.

03:52.199 --> 03:55.201
And hopefully that's
what you'll be doing now too.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.703
Change of plans.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.372
Welcome to the team,
hottie.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.007
We're consolidating
resources.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.676
Jessica didn't approve
the investigator?

04:02.677 --> 04:04.428
Jessica approved
anything we want,

04:04.429 --> 04:05.762
for one case.

04:05.763 --> 04:07.397
What?
No, we have to fight them all.

04:07.398 --> 04:08.482
And we will.

04:08.483 --> 04:10.851
By letting six
of them go?

04:10.852 --> 04:12.552
Do you know
how we won World War II?

04:12.553 --> 04:14.688
Yeah, of course. Spock didn't
let Kirk save Joan Collins

04:14.689 --> 04:15.989
from getting hit
by that car.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.557
Wrong.
We'd already won.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.692
Kirk just would have changed
the course of history.

04:19.694 --> 04:20.861
I accept that.

04:20.862 --> 04:23.113
Eisenhower had
156,000 men

04:23.114 --> 04:26.199
for 8 possible invasion points,
which means--

04:26.200 --> 04:30.036
- 19,500 men per point.
- Otherwise known as nothing.

04:30.037 --> 04:33.874
He had to put everything
that he had into one attack...

04:33.875 --> 04:35.542
Normandy.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.761
So the question is,
where the hell is our Normandy?

04:37.762 --> 04:39.963
That's easy.
Bakersfield.

04:39.964 --> 04:42.382
Lowest percentage
of female promotions--

04:42.383 --> 04:43.934
Highest percentage
of female applicants.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.219
And Hanley Folsom's
brother-in-law runs the plant.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.721
Exactly.

04:47.722 --> 04:50.223
You want to launch an attack,
you launch it from Bakersfield.

04:50.224 --> 04:51.758
Hey, am I Spock
or Kirk?

04:51.759 --> 04:52.759
Uhura.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.145
Walked right into it.

04:55.146 --> 04:58.448
I got you an espresso,
quad shot.

04:58.449 --> 05:00.367
- I don't need coffee.
- You might.

05:01.986 --> 05:04.154
I'm fine.

05:04.155 --> 05:05.155
What?

05:05.156 --> 05:07.791
Oh, your suit's
a little--

05:07.792 --> 05:10.243
It's a client meeting,
not a bachelor auction.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.795
Yeah, about that--

05:11.796 --> 05:13.330
What, are there too many
clients to fit in the library?

05:13.331 --> 05:14.781
We're using
the conference room.

05:14.782 --> 05:17.784
- They won't all fit.
- They will.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.503
There's been
a slight complication.

05:19.504 --> 05:20.921
Donna--

05:20.922 --> 05:24.224
You will understand
when you get there.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.651
Now you're ready.

05:34.652 --> 05:35.936
Donna.

05:35.937 --> 05:38.522
Scottie?
Harvey.

05:38.523 --> 05:41.307
- How's married life?
- I wouldn't know.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.326
Divorced so soon?

05:43.327 --> 05:45.862
I never took the plunge.

05:45.863 --> 05:47.497
Oh, get over yourself.

05:47.498 --> 05:49.449
I know I came here last time
with cold feet

05:49.450 --> 05:51.034
and blubbered over you
like a 15-year-old,

05:51.035 --> 05:52.702
but it wasn't about you.

05:52.703 --> 05:53.837
It was about me.

05:53.838 --> 05:56.206
So what's it about
this time?

05:56.207 --> 05:57.424
Bakersfield.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.376
You are not taking
my clients, Scottie.

05:59.377 --> 06:01.294
We already did.

06:01.295 --> 06:03.180
Like taking candy
from a little Harvard baby.

06:03.181 --> 06:04.330
You just said
it wasn't about me.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.432
Harvey,
Bakersfield is everything,

06:05.433 --> 06:06.633
and I've got them.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.051
I've also got appointments
with the rest.

06:08.052 --> 06:10.270
So I can spend time going
after them and get 20 more,

06:10.271 --> 06:14.140
or you could let me have 10
and we call it a day.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.508
Well, why don't I just
give it all to you?

06:15.509 --> 06:16.860
My cases, office,
my wallet, my keys--

06:16.861 --> 06:19.396
It's not personal.
It's just business.

06:19.397 --> 06:22.315
- Yeah, my business.
- Good business.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.183
The answer is no.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.570
Well, there's no harm
in asking.

06:26.571 --> 06:28.354
It's good
to see you, though.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.624
You look great.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.191
A bit overworked, but...

You've got to be kidding me.
She took Bakersfield?

07:13.764 --> 07:15.181
And she's looking
for ten more.

07:15.182 --> 07:18.151
A woman that goes after
what she wants.

07:18.152 --> 07:20.353
- You sound impressed.
- You don't.

07:20.354 --> 07:22.638
I already work with a woman
like that every day.

07:22.639 --> 07:25.191
Maybe I should have hired her
when I had the chance.

07:25.192 --> 07:26.493
What chance?

07:26.494 --> 07:28.077
There was one opening
that year,

07:28.078 --> 07:29.779
and she was the best
on paper,

07:29.780 --> 07:31.531
but I had already
invested so much in you

07:31.532 --> 07:33.867
that I decided to get a return
on my investment.

07:33.868 --> 07:35.585
Which is what I'm going
to give you right now,

07:35.586 --> 07:38.037
even though you don't have
any more money to invest.

07:38.038 --> 07:39.539
Are you back
to resources?

07:39.540 --> 07:43.159
Because I've had enough
of hearing about our weaknesses.

07:43.160 --> 07:47.263
I'm talking about turning it
into one of our strengths.

07:47.264 --> 07:48.932
I'm listening.

07:48.933 --> 07:50.467
Hardman knows
we're tapped out.

07:50.468 --> 07:51.768
He's counting on it.

07:51.769 --> 07:53.186
What if we're not?
What if we're flush?

07:53.187 --> 07:55.472
Are you talking
about joining forces with her?

07:55.473 --> 07:57.223
With her firm...

07:57.224 --> 08:00.360
Her infinitely
deep-pocketed firm.

08:00.361 --> 08:03.012
Harvey,
she wanted ten cases.

08:03.013 --> 08:05.398
You're talking
about sharing 45,

08:05.399 --> 08:06.900
and I've never known you
to share.

08:06.901 --> 08:09.202
They're based in London,
so we'll be running the show.

08:09.203 --> 08:10.737
They'll just be signing
the checks.

08:10.738 --> 08:12.539
And taking a cut
of the winnings.

08:12.540 --> 08:14.624
Exactly.
Winnings.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.025
It's the best way
to beat Hardman.

08:16.026 --> 08:19.078
And the side benefit is
you don't lose to Scottie.

08:19.079 --> 08:21.915
Nothing wrong
with a side benefit.

08:21.916 --> 08:24.384
Fine.
Don't lose to her.

08:24.385 --> 08:27.253
But you better make damn sure
that you don't lose with her.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:39.817 --> 08:40.900
Good.
You're here.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.235
I'm taking
the personnel files,

08:42.236 --> 08:43.736
you go through
the corporate minutes, and--

08:43.736 --> 08:45.738
Excuse me?

08:45.739 --> 08:47.941
Bakersfield.
We don't have all day.

08:49.944 --> 08:54.030
I'm--I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were on Bakersfield.

08:54.031 --> 08:56.332
Well, I am.
Let's go.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.567
The minutes
are over there,

08:57.568 --> 08:59.202
and they're not going
to read themselves.

08:59.203 --> 09:01.237
Okay, well, you may be
on Bakersfield,

09:01.238 --> 09:03.256
but I'm the lead
on Bakersfield,

09:03.257 --> 09:04.874
and we're not going to do any
of that stuff

09:04.875 --> 09:07.076
until we get Harvey
some up-to-date statistics.

09:07.077 --> 09:11.514
4.7% female executives--
up to date.

09:11.515 --> 09:12.799
That's a number.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.884
We need the probability
of that ratio being chance

09:14.885 --> 09:17.887
across 22 divisions
in 45 states, which is one--

09:17.888 --> 09:19.722
One in 8.3 billion.

09:19.723 --> 09:21.391
How did you know that?

09:21.392 --> 09:23.059
I checked
with the statistician.

09:23.060 --> 09:25.228
Yeah, well, he's wrong,
because he didn't--

09:25.229 --> 09:27.063
Adjust for outliers,
which takes it to--

09:27.064 --> 09:29.899
One in 6.4 billion.

09:29.900 --> 09:33.236
- How did you know that?
- I did it in my head.

09:33.237 --> 09:34.904
It's what I do.

09:34.905 --> 09:36.439
It's why I'm lead,

09:36.440 --> 09:39.208
and if you don't know,
you better ask somebody.

09:39.209 --> 09:41.244
I don't need to ask anybody

09:41.245 --> 09:43.496
to know that if we use
the 8.3 billion number,

09:43.497 --> 09:44.614
it's defensible,

09:44.615 --> 09:46.132
and it skews the results
in our favor.

09:46.133 --> 09:47.584
Oh, what a shock.

09:47.585 --> 09:48.668
You want to skew the results

09:48.669 --> 09:50.253
at the expense
of our credibility.

09:50.254 --> 09:51.638
We're not doing it.

09:51.639 --> 09:54.757
- I am a fifth year, Mike.
- And I work for Harvey.

09:54.758 --> 09:57.260
Well, Jessica assigned me.

09:57.261 --> 10:01.764
And if you don't like that,
why don't you go talk to her?

10:01.765 --> 10:03.516
I don't want to work
with Katrina.

10:03.517 --> 10:04.901
She comes in.
She takes over.

10:04.902 --> 10:06.402
She acts like everything
is her idea.

10:06.403 --> 10:07.687
Then we're
in the same boat,

10:07.688 --> 10:09.272
'cause I don't want
to work with Scottie.

10:09.273 --> 10:11.024
- We're working with Scottie?
- I'm working with Scottie.

10:11.025 --> 10:12.442
She's coming
to Bakersfield with us?

10:12.443 --> 10:13.993
She's coming
to Bakersfield with me.

10:13.994 --> 10:15.278
How can you do that
to me?

10:15.279 --> 10:17.246
I didn't do it to you.
She did. She stole them.

10:17.247 --> 10:19.315
- Wait. What?
- Relax, okay?

10:19.316 --> 10:20.833
You're going to go
on another road trip someday.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.251
No, Harvey,
you're not getting it.

10:22.252 --> 10:24.787
We're going
to lose World War II.

10:26.423 --> 10:28.541
What do you want?

10:28.542 --> 10:29.959
Coffee?
Tea?

10:29.960 --> 10:31.327
I'm good, thanks.

10:31.328 --> 10:34.631
A woman who wants nothing--
I distrust that.

10:34.632 --> 10:36.849
Who said I want nothing?

10:36.850 --> 10:38.334
Oh, no one's ever said that
about you.

10:38.335 --> 10:39.886
Oh, what have they said?

10:39.887 --> 10:41.854
"They"?

10:41.855 --> 10:43.690
You.

10:43.691 --> 10:45.308
My opinion matters to you?

10:45.309 --> 10:47.226
Your opinion matters to him.

10:47.227 --> 10:49.345
I've only ever said
good things about you, Scottie.

10:49.346 --> 10:51.347
But what have you thought?

10:51.348 --> 10:53.849
Just don't screw
with him.

10:53.850 --> 10:56.819
Don't screw with him,
or don't screw him?

10:56.820 --> 10:59.122
Are you able to do one
without the other?

10:59.123 --> 11:00.823
The other what?

11:00.824 --> 11:04.327
I'll leave you two
to business.

11:04.328 --> 11:06.162
So are you going
to take me up on my offer,

11:06.163 --> 11:07.380
or are you going
to fight me?

11:07.381 --> 11:09.132
You tell me.

11:09.133 --> 11:10.883
I think neither.

11:10.884 --> 11:12.702
I think you want us
to try the cases together

11:12.703 --> 11:15.088
and let my firm
bankroll the litigation.

11:15.089 --> 11:17.090
Which is exactly
what you wanted the whole time.

11:17.091 --> 11:20.376
You got me.
We'll start with Bakersfield.

11:20.377 --> 11:22.878
You couldn't just go
for the direct approach?

11:22.879 --> 11:25.098
You don't respond
to the direct approach, Harvey.

11:25.099 --> 11:27.400
You like to feel you can come
to things on your own.

11:27.401 --> 11:29.385
Which is why we're not
starting with Bakersfield.

11:29.386 --> 11:32.105
- It's the clear choice.
- Exactly.

11:32.106 --> 11:34.223
You knew it,
my first year knew it,

11:34.224 --> 11:35.408
and so will Hardman.

11:35.409 --> 11:37.410
- I'm not afraid of Hardman.
- You should be.

11:37.411 --> 11:39.895
And that's why
we're going to Parkville.

11:39.896 --> 11:41.497
You mean the one division
with a female manager

11:41.498 --> 11:43.082
and the best ratio
of women executives

11:43.083 --> 11:44.617
in the entire company?

11:44.618 --> 11:45.868
No, I mean the one division

11:45.869 --> 11:47.704
where Hardman will never think
to find us.

11:47.705 --> 11:49.205
Because it's
the dumbest place to start

11:49.206 --> 11:50.590
and the hardest place to win.

11:50.591 --> 11:53.960
And when we win it,
all the others will surrender.

11:53.961 --> 11:55.411
What a surprise--

11:55.412 --> 11:57.513
Harvey Specter wants
to do things the hard way.

11:57.514 --> 11:58.881
What a surprise--

11:58.882 --> 12:00.717
Dana Scott's looking
for the shortcut.

12:00.718 --> 12:03.252
And what makes you think
that he's not going to find out

12:03.253 --> 12:04.754
that we're not still going
to Bakersfield?

12:04.755 --> 12:06.255
We're still going
to Bakersfield.

12:06.256 --> 12:08.057
We book a plane,
a hotel,

12:08.058 --> 12:10.860
line up depositions there
and in all seven cities.

12:10.861 --> 12:14.363
That plan isn't worthy
of our kind of money.

12:14.364 --> 12:17.734
If you want
to overwhelm Hardman...

12:17.735 --> 12:20.987
We go to all 45 cities...

12:20.988 --> 12:24.607
Which is exactly
what you wanted the whole time.

12:24.608 --> 12:26.609
You got me.

12:28.796 --> 12:32.782
Hey, um, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

12:32.783 --> 12:33.883
and that you were right.

12:33.884 --> 12:35.134
Jessica assigned you,

12:35.135 --> 12:37.953
so you should take the lead
on Bakersfield.

12:37.954 --> 12:40.623
What are you going to do?

12:40.624 --> 12:42.592
I've got other things.
I'll be fine.

12:42.593 --> 12:45.511
Good. You're both here.
Change of plan.

12:45.512 --> 12:47.013
Uh, no need.
I already know, so...

12:47.014 --> 12:48.681
This isn't
about Parkville.

12:48.682 --> 12:50.566
I'm deposing Hanley Folsom
in 36 hours,

12:50.567 --> 12:52.819
and I need to know more
about him than his mistress does

12:52.820 --> 12:54.303
before he gets here.

12:54.304 --> 12:55.688
He has a mistress?

12:55.689 --> 12:57.406
That would help,
wouldn't it?

12:57.407 --> 13:00.443
And you should already know,
since you asked on this case.

13:00.444 --> 13:03.329
Now find me something.

13:05.415 --> 13:06.866
What are you pissed
about now?

13:06.867 --> 13:10.119
Jessica assigned you?
No, you asked.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.654
I asked,
and she assigned me.

13:11.655 --> 13:12.988
That's how it works.

13:12.989 --> 13:15.174
When you phrased it to me,
you picked language

13:15.175 --> 13:18.177
that skewed a little bit
in your favor.

13:18.178 --> 13:20.546
Like you just said,
"I've got other things,"

13:20.547 --> 13:22.932
instead of telling me
the focus of the entire case

13:22.933 --> 13:24.467
apparently just moved
to Parkville,

13:24.468 --> 13:26.469
which I don't have
a problem with,

13:26.470 --> 13:28.137
but clearly
you have a problem with me.

13:28.138 --> 13:30.840
My problem with you
is how you got here.

13:30.841 --> 13:32.141
That's funny,

13:32.142 --> 13:33.976
because my problem with you
is how I got here.

13:33.977 --> 13:35.144
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:35.145 --> 13:36.445
Harvey offered me a job,

13:36.446 --> 13:37.980
and I thought it was
because I'd impressed him.

13:37.981 --> 13:39.682
Then you showed up,
ready to break privilege,

13:39.683 --> 13:41.200
and I knew the real reason.

13:41.201 --> 13:43.870
He was hiring me
to protect you.

13:43.871 --> 13:45.121
Right, and then
after you found out

13:45.122 --> 13:46.289
the real reason for the offer,

13:46.290 --> 13:47.406
you went to Harvey,
and you said,

13:47.407 --> 13:48.875
"I can't possibly accept
employment

13:48.876 --> 13:50.159
under those circumstances."

13:50.160 --> 13:51.327
Oh, wait.
No, you didn't.

13:51.328 --> 13:52.411
You're damn right I didn't,

13:52.412 --> 13:53.546
because I couldn't,

13:53.547 --> 13:55.498
because I had already
given notice.

13:55.499 --> 13:57.166
Stop taking everything
so personally

13:57.167 --> 13:59.051
and get over it.

14:02.060 --> 14:03.928
Tell me you're
not having "Lear" envy.

14:05.217 --> 14:06.217
It's nice.

14:06.218 --> 14:07.251
"Nice"?

14:07.252 --> 14:08.603
Should we have taken
your jet?

14:08.604 --> 14:11.088
Oh, wait.
You don't have a jet.

14:11.089 --> 14:12.607
It's hard to park them
in Manhattan.

14:12.608 --> 14:15.443
Oh, right. I forgot how
provincial Pearson Hardman was--

14:15.444 --> 14:16.894
one office, one city.

14:16.895 --> 14:19.981
One office, the city.

14:22.267 --> 14:23.267
What?

14:23.268 --> 14:24.736
It just occurred to me.

14:24.737 --> 14:26.037
Oh, let me guess.

14:26.038 --> 14:28.489
There's an advantage
to being on the same side.

14:28.490 --> 14:33.628
Well, we don't have to get
the business out of the way

14:33.629 --> 14:34.732
before getting
to the pleasure.

14:34.733 --> 14:36.150
There's also
a disadvantage.

14:36.151 --> 14:38.202
Oh, let me guess.
You have some rule.

14:38.203 --> 14:39.704
I don't cook
in my own kitchen.

14:39.705 --> 14:41.355
- You cook?
- It's a metaphor.

14:41.356 --> 14:43.357
Yeah, I got that.
But you're in luck.

14:43.358 --> 14:45.543
We are not
in the same kitchen.

14:45.544 --> 14:49.330
We are on this case.

14:49.331 --> 14:51.866
Somebody didn't read
the paperwork.

14:51.867 --> 14:54.502
When do I ever read
the paperwork?

14:54.503 --> 14:55.753
We're still
separate entities.

14:55.754 --> 14:58.056
It's just a combined
legal action.

14:58.057 --> 14:59.390
Mm, I like the sound
of that.

14:59.391 --> 15:01.059
I was hoping
you would.

15:01.060 --> 15:04.095
Are you going to litigate me
into sleeping with you?

15:04.096 --> 15:06.681
I'm going to lead you
right where you're dying to go.

15:09.384 --> 15:11.019
How long
until we land?

15:11.020 --> 15:13.604
Long enough.

15:13.605 --> 15:17.492
- Combined legal action.
- Mm-hmm.

15:17.493 --> 15:19.060
You know, wait.

15:19.061 --> 15:21.162
We didn't decide who's taking
the lead on the deposition.

15:21.163 --> 15:23.664
Well, we could
rock, paper, scissors for it.

15:24.833 --> 15:25.900
Or we can do this.

15:25.901 --> 15:28.536
How will we know
who won?

15:31.740 --> 15:32.740
Oh, we'll know.

15:47.272 --> 15:48.473
Hey, sweetpants.

15:48.474 --> 15:49.974
I feel like
I never see you anymore,

15:49.975 --> 15:51.476
so I was wondering
if you want--

15:51.477 --> 15:54.112
oh, my God.
What happened?

15:59.318 --> 16:00.701
You didn't get in.

16:00.702 --> 16:02.269
I don't want to talk
about it.

16:02.270 --> 16:03.821
I understand.

16:03.822 --> 16:05.873
Hey, Rachel, I need your help.

16:05.874 --> 16:07.909
Um, yes.
What do you need?

16:07.910 --> 16:09.627
I'm ready to work.

16:09.628 --> 16:11.996
Listen, if you need help
with any of it,

16:11.997 --> 16:13.915
I'm going to be at my desk.

16:13.916 --> 16:16.283
Thanks, Donna.

16:16.284 --> 16:18.669
Don't take it
so personally.

16:18.670 --> 16:19.787
What?

16:19.788 --> 16:21.255
That's what someone
said to me.

16:21.256 --> 16:22.957
And whenever someone says
something's not personal,

16:22.958 --> 16:24.759
it is, because everything
is personal.

16:24.760 --> 16:25.843
I know.

16:25.844 --> 16:27.428
What do you think
Hanley Folsom's

16:27.429 --> 16:29.130
personal opinion is
on hiring women?

16:29.131 --> 16:32.299
Uh, that he doesn't think
we're good enough,

16:32.300 --> 16:34.185
but, I mean, it's not
like he would say it out loud.

16:34.186 --> 16:36.971
Not at work.

16:36.972 --> 16:40.441
Which is why you need access
to his personal correspondence.

16:40.442 --> 16:42.309
- Exactly.
- That's outside the scope.

16:42.310 --> 16:43.911
Well, let's find a way
to put it inside the scope.

16:43.912 --> 16:44.912
Do you have any ideas?

16:44.913 --> 16:46.247
No,
but I have 62 boxes

16:46.248 --> 16:47.782
and 12 hours
to find an idea.

16:47.783 --> 16:51.285
Exactly what I need to do--
let's go.

16:53.321 --> 16:55.656
- I told you I'd win.
- Maybe I let you win.

16:55.657 --> 16:57.758
You've never let anybody
win anything in your whole life.

16:57.759 --> 16:59.710
Why would you start now?

16:59.711 --> 17:01.379
Now I get
to demand a rematch.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.831
And I get
to lead the deposition.

17:03.832 --> 17:05.833
Parkville, Missouri--

17:05.834 --> 17:08.669
of all the places
to run into you, Harvey.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.271
Glad you could make it.

17:10.271 --> 17:11.271
I almost didn't.

17:11.272 --> 17:12.807
I was on my way
to Bakersfield--

17:12.808 --> 17:15.675
after all, Harvey Specter
had a flight booked there--

17:15.676 --> 17:17.344
when, suddenly,
I had a thought.

17:17.345 --> 17:18.512
What would Harvey do?

17:18.512 --> 17:20.397
So I checked,

17:20.398 --> 17:22.366
and Dana Scott's flight plan
was here.

17:22.367 --> 17:27.155
Can't get around those pesky
F.A.A. regulations, can you?

17:27.156 --> 17:28.489
I hope you've got
all the cities covered,

17:28.490 --> 17:30.041
'cause we've got
people everywhere.

17:30.042 --> 17:32.326
Deep pockets.

17:32.327 --> 17:33.911
Dana Scott.
A pleasure.

17:33.912 --> 17:35.046
I can't say the same.

17:35.047 --> 17:36.530
You do like
strong women, Harvey.

17:36.531 --> 17:37.798
And you don't like women
at all.

17:37.799 --> 17:39.200
Oh, she's cute.

17:39.201 --> 17:40.501
This should be fun.

17:40.502 --> 17:42.637
Oh, I'm just getting a call
from my niece

17:42.638 --> 17:45.723
who needs help
with her homework.

17:45.724 --> 17:46.924
What do you got?

17:46.925 --> 17:50.544
I know why
they promoted Cathleen Mitchell.

17:50.545 --> 17:52.230
What is your title,
Ms. Mitchell?

17:52.231 --> 17:54.565
Vice President,
Regional Services.

17:54.566 --> 17:56.567
And how many
management positions are there

17:56.568 --> 17:57.935
in your region?
612.

17:57.936 --> 17:59.403
And how many of those
are women?

17:59.404 --> 18:00.738
41.

18:00.739 --> 18:04.825
41 out of 612--
that's, uh, 6.6%.

18:04.826 --> 18:06.894
- 6.7%, if you round up.
- Let's not.

18:06.895 --> 18:08.496
And who sets
the hiring policy?

18:08.497 --> 18:10.231
The hiring policy
is that we hire

18:10.232 --> 18:12.399
the best applicant
for each job.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.668
I'm confused.

18:13.669 --> 18:16.003
Are women inherently
inferior, then?

18:16.004 --> 18:17.205
No.

18:17.206 --> 18:18.673
Well, then why is it
that your company

18:18.674 --> 18:20.708
doesn't want to promote women
into positions of power?

18:20.709 --> 18:22.627
I am in a position of power.

18:22.628 --> 18:26.347
Yes, but you're not exactly
like other women, are you?

18:26.348 --> 18:27.414
Harvey?

18:27.415 --> 18:29.800
You applied four times
for management,

18:29.801 --> 18:31.969
and you've been rejected
every time,

18:31.970 --> 18:34.305
due to reviews
containing the terms

18:34.306 --> 18:37.975
"aggressive," "hostile,"
and "overly ambitious."

18:37.976 --> 18:39.593
And then, suddenly,
you were "dedicated,"

18:39.594 --> 18:41.779
"hardworking,"
and "a team player."

18:41.780 --> 18:43.114
People change, Harvey.

18:43.115 --> 18:44.815
And the last I checked,
you have to ask a question.

18:44.816 --> 18:47.151
I will,
and it's about that change.

18:47.152 --> 18:50.037
Were you diagnosed
with uterine cancer in 2009?

18:50.038 --> 18:51.539
- That is not relevant.
- Are you married?

18:51.540 --> 18:52.907
- What does that--
- Do you have any children?

18:52.908 --> 18:54.325
- No.
- Can you have any children?

18:54.326 --> 18:56.661
This is beyond the pale,
Harvey, even for you.

18:56.662 --> 18:58.412
Should I read your deposition
of Jessica Pearson

18:58.413 --> 18:59.780
from two weeks ago?

18:59.781 --> 19:01.966
That's a different case
and inadmissible here.

19:01.967 --> 19:05.119
Did you or did you not
have a hysterectomy

19:05.120 --> 19:06.837
that rendered you unable
to have children

19:06.838 --> 19:08.472
nine months
before you were promoted?

19:08.473 --> 19:10.308
- She is not going to answer.
- Maybe not today.

19:10.309 --> 19:12.260
But it will become part
of the record.

19:12.261 --> 19:14.628
Hanley Folsom only promotes

19:14.629 --> 19:19.267
women whose attention to home
and family isn't in question.

19:19.268 --> 19:20.568
Except for one thing.

19:20.569 --> 19:22.186
Mr. Folsom didn't know.

19:22.187 --> 19:23.971
So you say.

19:23.972 --> 19:25.856
He didn't know
because I didn't tell anybody,

19:25.857 --> 19:27.241
because it's my business.

19:27.242 --> 19:29.160
Still, he found out,

19:29.161 --> 19:31.162
and that's why
you were promoted.

19:31.163 --> 19:32.413
Harvey, that's enough.

19:32.414 --> 19:33.981
Will you look
at that, Harvey?

19:33.982 --> 19:35.616
Even Ms. Scott understands

19:35.617 --> 19:37.251
that being childless
and unmarried

19:37.252 --> 19:41.088
doesn't make you
damaged goods.

19:41.089 --> 19:43.324
But if that's how you're framing
your argument,

19:43.325 --> 19:45.159
good luck.

19:45.160 --> 19:47.595
We'll see you
in Bakersfield...

19:47.596 --> 19:49.213
And everywhere else.

19:55.437 --> 19:57.938
How could you not tell me
that she'd had a hysterectomy?

19:57.939 --> 19:59.506
Because I just got
the information

19:59.507 --> 20:00.858
on my way into the room.

20:00.859 --> 20:03.277
You could have taken
five seconds to fill me in.

20:03.278 --> 20:04.511
I didn't fill you in

20:04.512 --> 20:06.197
because I wasn't sure
you could play good cop.

20:06.198 --> 20:07.514
Because you weren't sure
that I could play it,

20:07.515 --> 20:08.849
or because even when we're
on the same side,

20:08.850 --> 20:10.034
you still want to win?

20:10.035 --> 20:11.518
If I told you,
you wouldn't be pissed off.

20:11.519 --> 20:12.620
Now you can go to her

20:12.621 --> 20:14.322
and call me an asshole
with conviction.

20:14.323 --> 20:16.874
You're an asshole.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.827
Wait a second.

20:19.828 --> 20:23.080
You're accusing me
of still trying to win?

20:23.081 --> 20:25.416
You're the one who's still
trying to win something.

20:25.417 --> 20:27.218
You know,
I should have known.

20:27.219 --> 20:28.669
It's never the whole story
with you.

20:28.670 --> 20:32.056
What the hell's
really going on?

20:32.057 --> 20:34.425
You beat me last time.

20:34.426 --> 20:37.178
And ever since then,
Edward Darby hasn't seen me

20:37.179 --> 20:39.180
as worthy
of being a name partner.

20:39.181 --> 20:41.732
Cooke would never allow that
to happen, anyway.

20:41.733 --> 20:43.100
He can't stand Americans.

20:43.101 --> 20:44.402
Cooke retired,

20:44.403 --> 20:46.887
and he decided there's more
to life than work.

20:46.888 --> 20:49.056
So, if you deliver
a huge win...

20:49.057 --> 20:51.859
I get my name
on the door.

20:51.860 --> 20:55.913
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

20:55.914 --> 20:58.366
You always respond
to strength,

20:58.367 --> 21:01.085
not weakness.

21:01.086 --> 21:05.005
Look at that.
You really did fool me.

21:05.006 --> 21:07.375
If I had known that you
were that good a performer,

21:07.376 --> 21:08.742
I would've let you
be good cop.

21:10.212 --> 21:12.713
Stop.

21:14.749 --> 21:17.435
Cooke really decided
there's more to life than work?

21:17.436 --> 21:20.187
Yep.

21:20.188 --> 21:22.589
Pussy.

21:26.778 --> 21:28.262
Um, where have you been?

21:28.263 --> 21:29.613
- I've been right here.
- I've been waiting for you.

21:29.614 --> 21:31.065
I finished
going through everything.

21:31.066 --> 21:32.817
Me too. It's all catalogued.
It's right there.

21:32.818 --> 21:34.702
Okay, good,
'cause I got to get it to--

21:34.703 --> 21:36.070
where's 15 through 20?

21:36.071 --> 21:38.155
I thought that was you.

21:38.156 --> 21:39.773
The boxes
are right there, Rachel.

21:39.774 --> 21:41.325
What's the matter with you?
Come on.

21:41.326 --> 21:42.743
You're late.

21:42.744 --> 21:45.296
Katrina handed me her briefs
an hour ago.

21:45.297 --> 21:47.281
Um, yeah, I've, uh--
I got most of mine.

21:47.282 --> 21:49.333
Most?

21:49.334 --> 21:51.168
If I can't count on you
for the effort,

21:51.169 --> 21:54.305
how the hell am I supposed
to count on you for the results?

21:54.306 --> 21:57.124
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.677
Um, I'll get it done.
Too late.

21:59.678 --> 22:01.178
Now I have to call
Daniel Hardman

22:01.179 --> 22:02.763
and postpone
and look like a fool.

22:02.764 --> 22:04.131
Thank you, Mr. Ross.

22:06.935 --> 22:09.303
- Mike--
- I don't want to hear it.

22:09.304 --> 22:11.272
Get it done.

22:19.725 --> 22:20.846
Rachael?

22:20.871 --> 22:21.808
Yes.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.876
Katrina Bennett.
We haven't met yet.

22:23.877 --> 22:25.744
Oh, I-I know who you are.
Welcome.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.413
Louis says you're
the best paralegal around.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.916
Thank you.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.417
I need 40 copies
of these,

22:32.418 --> 22:33.886
and if you can duplicate
the tabs

22:33.887 --> 22:35.304
and have it back to me
within in an hour,

22:35.305 --> 22:38.223
I will be eternally
in your debt.

22:38.224 --> 22:41.060
Uh, Katrina, I'm so sorry.
I just can't.

22:41.061 --> 22:42.528
I'm too busy right now.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.262
Too busy on what?

22:44.263 --> 22:45.764
I'm going back
through discovery

22:45.765 --> 22:46.982
to see if I can find a door

22:46.983 --> 22:48.934
into Folsom's
personal correspondence.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.653
That's a wild-goose chase.
Who put you on that?

22:50.654 --> 22:51.770
Mike Ross.

22:51.771 --> 22:52.938
Well, I'm sorry
you're busy

22:52.939 --> 22:54.239
working on something
for a first year.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.242
But the managing partner
asked me to do something,

22:57.243 --> 22:59.111
and I didn't tell her
I was too busy.

22:59.112 --> 23:00.796
Right.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.948
This is for the same
managing partner.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.917
Yes, but she didn't ask
for it.

23:04.918 --> 23:06.969
Mike Ross did.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.505
Look, I know
you've taken your LSATs,

23:09.506 --> 23:11.390
and you may well be ready
to be a lawyer.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.425
But right now
you're not.

23:13.426 --> 23:16.095
You're a paralegal.

23:16.096 --> 23:19.798
I'm doing my job,
and I need you to do yours.

23:31.444 --> 23:32.644
Rachel, do me a favor?

23:32.645 --> 23:33.912
Can you just put that on pause
for a sec?

23:33.913 --> 23:35.247
'Cause I need
to make a copy.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.916
No, Louis, I can't.
I'm busy doing my job.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.317
Excuse me?

23:39.318 --> 23:41.286
What, do you want to fire me
like you fired Harold?

23:41.287 --> 23:43.655
Because honestly,
I-I-I don't give a shit.

23:47.210 --> 23:48.927
I get it.

23:48.928 --> 23:52.598
Rachel, listen, I know
about the Harvard thing.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.600
And I think it's great.
What?

23:54.601 --> 23:55.768
Yeah, Norma told me.

23:55.769 --> 23:57.553
Rachel, I know
the waiting is hard,

23:57.554 --> 24:00.222
but you're not going to be here
for much longer.

24:00.223 --> 24:04.026
I got 100% faith in you.

24:04.027 --> 24:05.944
I didn't get in.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.146
What?

24:07.147 --> 24:08.397
I don't understand.
I had everything--

24:08.398 --> 24:10.682
my grades, the LSATs,
I'm a legacy,

24:10.683 --> 24:11.950
and I don't even
puff myself up,

24:11.951 --> 24:13.619
but I killed it
at that interview.

24:13.620 --> 24:14.987
That doesn't make
any sense.

24:14.988 --> 24:16.622
And do you remember that woman
who came from Harvard?

24:16.623 --> 24:18.523
She didn't like anyone,
but I swear, she loved me.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.409
Sheila?

24:20.410 --> 24:22.694
Yeah.
Sheila--Sheila Sazs.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.713
You remember.

24:24.714 --> 24:26.531
Yeah, I remember.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.700
Is there something wrong?

24:28.701 --> 24:30.035
Yep, there is
something wrong.

24:30.036 --> 24:33.005
I believe
you were wronged.

24:33.006 --> 24:34.223
I believe you suffered

24:34.224 --> 24:36.175
the slings and arrows
of outrageous wrongness.

24:36.176 --> 24:37.709
And I will not have it.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.144
What does that mean?

24:39.145 --> 24:41.230
That means that I'm going
to rectify this situation,

24:41.231 --> 24:44.233
because you, Miss Zane,
you're going to Harvard.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.271
Looks like somebody
had a good trip.

24:49.272 --> 24:51.323
- Not exactly.
- Though the plane ride was fun.

24:51.324 --> 24:55.110
As long as you didn't hit
any turbulence.

24:55.111 --> 24:57.246
Jessica wants
to see you.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.831
I'll be right back.

24:58.832 --> 25:00.616
Actually, she wants
to see both of you.

25:00.617 --> 25:02.234
Jessica wants
to see me too?

25:02.235 --> 25:05.671
Not exactly.
Your boss wants to see you.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.676
I'll just ask the concierge
to find something--

25:10.677 --> 25:13.411
- Hello.
- Ah, Dana.

25:13.412 --> 25:16.248
And this must be
the man himself.

25:16.249 --> 25:17.766
Edward Darby.

25:17.767 --> 25:21.053
He doesn't seem stodgy at all,
or that old.

25:21.054 --> 25:23.222
You should see me
in my altogether.

25:23.223 --> 25:24.223
Pass.

25:24.224 --> 25:25.524
Fair enough.

25:27.310 --> 25:29.862
Edward stopped in
to take stock of his investment.

25:29.863 --> 25:31.196
So how are we?

25:31.197 --> 25:32.481
We're right on schedule.

25:32.482 --> 25:34.199
Dana?

25:34.200 --> 25:35.400
We've dropped a grenade.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.236
We're just waiting
for it to go off.

25:37.237 --> 25:39.738
- Meaning it hasn't.
- Rome wasn't built in a day.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.241
Excellent point.
I needn't have crossed the pond.

25:42.242 --> 25:44.776
And yet, here you are.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.613
Well, as I confessed
to Jessica,

25:48.614 --> 25:52.217
I have an ulterior motive
in our little venture.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.086
Daniel Hardman.

25:54.087 --> 25:57.956
I've had
the distinct displeasure.

25:57.957 --> 26:01.126
So I have asked him
to step it up a notch.

26:03.313 --> 26:06.265
Nice.
Attack him on all fronts.

26:06.266 --> 26:08.066
We have clients
everywhere.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.801
Finding a bone
of contention with him

26:09.802 --> 26:12.237
seemed the least
I could contribute.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.022
Along with 12 million pounds.

26:14.023 --> 26:17.075
I hate talking numbers.
I prefer raking them in.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.112
Well, I've done
what I came to do.

26:20.113 --> 26:22.247
Now I'm going to get
out of your way.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.416
Nice to put a face
to all this.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.919
And a lovely face,
it turns out.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.320
Thank you, Edward.

26:28.321 --> 26:29.872
I was referring
to your man.

26:31.374 --> 26:34.293
I'll be waiting
for that detonation.

26:34.294 --> 26:36.595
I trust it will come through.
Mmhmm.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.268
You wanted to see me?

26:43.269 --> 26:45.721
Yeah.

26:45.722 --> 26:47.773
I wanted to explain
about earlier.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.858
You don't have to. It's fine.
I overreacted.

26:49.859 --> 26:51.310
Okay, then I won't.

26:51.311 --> 26:53.645
I will just tell you
I found what you needed.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.697
What, like you went
through the rest of the files?

26:55.698 --> 26:57.783
No.
I found what you needed.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.318
- Access?
- Hanley Folsom.

26:59.319 --> 27:00.786
- Personal?
- Bingo.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.487
Oh, my God, that couldn't
have come at a better time.

27:02.488 --> 27:03.855
I would have found them
for you sooner,

27:03.856 --> 27:05.290
but I had to copy
some bullshit for Katrina.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.709
Why didn't you just tell her
you were working for me?

27:07.710 --> 27:09.294
I told her exactly
what I was doing for you.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.246
And she didn't--
oh, God.

27:11.247 --> 27:13.248
Never mind. I get it.
She did the same thing to me.

27:13.249 --> 27:14.666
She pulls
that fifth-year crap,

27:14.667 --> 27:16.084
and then you don't feel
like dealing.

27:16.085 --> 27:17.336
You have no idea.

27:17.337 --> 27:19.537
What do we have?

27:19.538 --> 27:22.040
Enough for you
to write a motion.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.426
- He seems nice.
- He was pissed.

27:24.427 --> 27:26.929
That was pissed?
What does happy look like?

27:26.930 --> 27:28.347
He's British--
pretty much the same thing.

27:28.348 --> 27:29.881
Then how'd you know
he was pissed?

27:29.882 --> 27:31.516
- Wouldn't you be?
- I am.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.551
We haven't turned
Cathleen Mitchell yet.

27:33.552 --> 27:34.886
Your good cop failed.

27:34.887 --> 27:37.222
No, your move failed.

27:37.223 --> 27:38.890
Well, Jessica
took it well.

27:38.891 --> 27:41.159
Because she had company.
I'll hear about it later.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.694
Does he do that--

27:42.695 --> 27:44.729
just pop in
for a spot of tea?

27:44.730 --> 27:46.698
It's 12 million pounds.

27:46.699 --> 27:49.234
You weren't expecting him.

27:49.235 --> 27:51.236
No...

27:51.237 --> 27:53.755
I wasn't.

27:53.756 --> 27:56.008
But this is a big investment
for him, Harvey.

27:56.009 --> 27:57.742
His investment
is only money.

27:57.743 --> 28:00.963
For me,
it's my whole firm.

28:00.964 --> 28:04.716
Excuse me.
Harvey, do you have a minute?

28:07.420 --> 28:10.605
You got here just in time.
I'm getting us access.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.691
- Hanley Folsom?
- Bingo.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.759
Well, if you're talking
about the July 29th reference

28:14.760 --> 28:16.594
in his business email
to his personal email,

28:16.595 --> 28:18.263
then you're too late.
What?

28:18.264 --> 28:20.315
Katrina gave me the subpoena
an hour ago.

28:20.316 --> 28:22.617
I guess it's a good thing
Jessica put her

28:22.618 --> 28:24.269
on the case after all.

28:36.624 --> 28:40.005
When people steal from me,
I take it personally.

28:40.007 --> 28:42.225
- Are you subpoenaing me?
- You diverted Rachel.

28:42.226 --> 28:44.094
And then you pursued
my idea yourself.

28:44.095 --> 28:45.729
Your idea?

28:45.730 --> 28:47.297
Are you denying it?

28:47.298 --> 28:49.566
No, you said we needed to fly,
so I built an airplane.

28:49.567 --> 28:51.334
And then flew it
right into Harvey's office

28:51.335 --> 28:52.769
just in time to take credit.

28:52.770 --> 28:54.521
I offered you a chance
to work together.

28:54.522 --> 28:55.772
You didn't want
to take it.

28:55.773 --> 28:56.990
You've always got an answer.

28:56.991 --> 28:59.109
And you've always got
an accusation.

28:59.110 --> 29:00.360
So either run to Harvey

29:00.361 --> 29:02.195
and tell him
your little tale of woe,

29:02.196 --> 29:04.647
or get to work
prepping for Folsom, like I am.

29:15.492 --> 29:16.859
Louis.

29:16.860 --> 29:18.661
Sheila.

29:18.662 --> 29:21.563
- Where's my interviewee?
- I dispatched him.

29:21.564 --> 29:22.615
That's unacceptable.

29:22.616 --> 29:27.169
- You are unacceptable.
- Excuse me?

29:27.170 --> 29:28.871
You behaved
unprofessionally.

29:28.872 --> 29:30.589
I never behave
unprofessionally.

29:30.590 --> 29:32.458
Okay, fine.

29:32.459 --> 29:33.592
Ski mask and coconut oil?

29:33.593 --> 29:34.910
That was personal.

29:34.911 --> 29:37.346
But you let the personal
color the professional,

29:37.347 --> 29:39.048
and Rachel Zane
will not be a casualty

29:39.049 --> 29:40.249
of your misplaced anger.

29:40.250 --> 29:43.085
"Misplaced"?
You made me look the fool.

29:43.086 --> 29:44.470
I looked the fool.

29:44.471 --> 29:46.689
You were collateral damage--
not my fault.

29:46.690 --> 29:48.424
And it certainly
wasn't Ms. Zane's fault.

29:48.425 --> 29:51.260
So you're here to be
her knight in shining armor.

29:51.261 --> 29:52.928
I'm here to right a wrong.

29:52.929 --> 29:56.031
- How very--
- Very what?

29:56.032 --> 29:57.199
Noble.

30:01.604 --> 30:05.374
Yeah, it is.

30:05.375 --> 30:09.545
And you're going
to undo this.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.630
I am.

30:11.631 --> 30:14.283
That's not what I meant.

30:14.284 --> 30:17.420
But it's what you've caused.

30:17.421 --> 30:19.638
I...

30:19.639 --> 30:20.956
Will not be denied.

30:20.957 --> 30:22.475
Then come reap
what you've sowed.

30:22.476 --> 30:24.977
- Have at you.
- Joust me.

30:28.148 --> 30:29.515
I don't care what it takes.

30:29.516 --> 30:31.767
We need to get to that
smoking gun before Katrina does.

30:31.768 --> 30:35.855
She already found it.

30:35.856 --> 30:37.773
Katrina gave it
to Missy Dietler to make copies.

30:37.774 --> 30:41.977
I'm sure it's already
in Jessica's hands by now.

30:41.978 --> 30:44.914
Wait a minute.
Missy Dietler?

30:44.915 --> 30:47.450
She's going to take four coffee
breaks before she's done.

30:47.451 --> 30:48.617
She's going to take
four coffee breaks

30:48.618 --> 30:49.752
before she finishes
her coffee break.

30:49.753 --> 30:51.170
Which means
it's probably still

30:51.171 --> 30:52.821
in the copy machine
right now.

30:52.822 --> 30:54.123
Missy's not going to leave
the documents

30:54.124 --> 30:55.374
just sitting
in the copy machine.

30:55.375 --> 30:58.093
No, but she probably
already scanned them.

30:58.094 --> 31:00.095
So all we need
is her code.

31:00.096 --> 31:03.665
You're talking about
stealing someone's work.

31:03.666 --> 31:07.836
Mm, someone who lied to you,
stole from me,

31:07.837 --> 31:09.855
and made us both
look like fools.

31:09.856 --> 31:11.474
Look, if you have any qualms,
think about it.

31:11.475 --> 31:12.775
We're all
on the same team.

31:12.776 --> 31:14.477
The faster this gets done,
the better for everyone.

31:14.478 --> 31:16.145
Oh, you got an answer
for everything.

31:16.146 --> 31:18.147
Well, so does she.

31:18.148 --> 31:19.982
Are you sure
you want to do this?

31:19.983 --> 31:22.735
Yes.

31:22.736 --> 31:25.371
Uh, whoa.
What are you doing?

31:25.372 --> 31:27.323
Manningham's had a crush
on me since the day I got here.

31:27.324 --> 31:29.542
He would give me his mother's
social security number

31:29.543 --> 31:30.859
if I asked him for it.

31:30.860 --> 31:32.328
Okay, Rachel, we don't
have much time.

31:32.329 --> 31:33.496
I need a sure thing here.

31:33.497 --> 31:36.865
Mike...

31:36.866 --> 31:39.635
I am a sure thing.

31:45.509 --> 31:47.009
Yeah, I mean,
give it a shot.

31:47.010 --> 31:49.345
It probably won't work,
but, um...

31:52.232 --> 31:55.884
That was brutal,
deliciously brutal.

31:55.885 --> 31:59.855
And your act of vengeance
raised my ire.

31:59.856 --> 32:03.826
You, sir, are a knight.

32:03.827 --> 32:07.563
And now it is time
to right what is wrong.

32:07.564 --> 32:10.232
Look, Sheila, I'm flattered
by what you did,

32:10.233 --> 32:12.618
but this is not fair,

32:12.619 --> 32:15.621
and you know it can't stand.

32:15.622 --> 32:18.924
Louis, pull a resume
from the stack--any one.

32:18.925 --> 32:20.960
Read it.

32:23.580 --> 32:25.722
Sure.

32:27.634 --> 32:30.302
Magna cum laude,
Yale, 3.9 GPA.

32:30.303 --> 32:32.304
Another one.

32:34.558 --> 32:37.526
Summa cum laude,
Georgetown, 4.3. GPA.

32:37.527 --> 32:39.478
Listen, I get it.
I know what you're trying--

32:39.479 --> 32:42.648
That's my reject pile.

32:45.986 --> 32:47.369
I am a professional.

32:47.370 --> 32:48.821
I would never let
my feelings for you

32:48.822 --> 32:50.322
sway me against a candidate.

32:50.323 --> 32:52.124
Okay, but you have
to let them

32:52.125 --> 32:54.276
sway you
for a candidate.

32:54.277 --> 32:56.879
You can't ask me that.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.998
Rachel Zane
is the best paralegal

32:58.999 --> 33:00.833
in the best law firm
in New York.

33:00.834 --> 33:03.669
She is relied upon
by the best lawyers

33:03.670 --> 33:05.971
who have graduated
from the best university.

33:05.972 --> 33:07.339
The woman is crimson.

33:07.340 --> 33:08.974
So who do I knock out?

33:11.845 --> 33:13.062
I promised her.

33:13.063 --> 33:17.516
Louis, I liked her.
I did.

33:17.517 --> 33:21.403
You're just going to have
to tell her the truth.

33:21.404 --> 33:24.473
Sometimes
good isn't good enough.

33:27.661 --> 33:30.412
So how's
that detonation coming?

33:30.413 --> 33:31.830
Long fuse.

33:31.831 --> 33:33.832
Is that your way of telling me
that it's never going off?

33:33.833 --> 33:35.167
Well, if it doesn't,

33:35.168 --> 33:36.919
you could always have James Bond
take care of it for you.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.320
That reminds me.

33:38.321 --> 33:40.205
How are things going
with Pussy Galore?

33:40.206 --> 33:42.041
Um, I believe,
at this point,

33:42.042 --> 33:46.161
she's still flying missions
for Goldfinger.

33:46.162 --> 33:48.714
"No, Mr. Bond,
I expect you to die."

33:48.715 --> 33:50.499
What the hell
are you doing here?

33:50.500 --> 33:52.501
We can win Parkville.

33:54.504 --> 33:56.672
This is the key
to everything.

33:56.673 --> 34:00.175
Well, then we need to get
Pussy Galore back on that plane.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.735
Just remember
what I told you.

34:14.737 --> 34:16.971
No matter
what happens--

34:16.972 --> 34:20.108
well, if it isn't
the three stooges.

34:20.109 --> 34:21.827
Oh, dibs on Curly.

34:21.828 --> 34:23.745
Would you gentlemen mind
accompanying us

34:23.746 --> 34:25.496
to the conference room?

34:25.498 --> 34:27.783
What is she doing here?

34:27.784 --> 34:28.983
Dana Scott?

34:28.984 --> 34:31.152
She's the attorney of record
on the case.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.987
He's referring
to my employee.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.674
Oh, well, at the moment,
she's reading this.

34:35.675 --> 34:37.426
An email you wrote
from your personal account

34:37.427 --> 34:39.127
on the subject
of hiring Ms. Mitchell.

34:39.128 --> 34:41.996
And next,
we'll show her the attachment.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.348
It wasn't on your copy.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.500
Oddly enough,
it wasn't on ours either.

34:45.501 --> 34:47.335
Mike managed
to find the original.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.020
We'll need time
to review this.

34:49.021 --> 34:50.389
Review it?
He wrote it.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.190
You knew
she couldn't have children.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.692
That's why you
changed her review,

34:53.693 --> 34:55.143
and that's why you
promoted her.

34:55.143 --> 34:57.312
And when she sees it,
she'll join the suit,

34:57.313 --> 35:01.683
and you won't stand a chance.

35:01.684 --> 35:03.952
That email
doesn't prove a pattern.

35:03.953 --> 35:06.405
- It proves what he did to her.
- It's one case.

35:06.406 --> 35:07.873
We'll see you
at the next 44.

35:07.874 --> 35:09.157
In the meantime,

35:09.158 --> 35:10.742
we won't be participating
in that deposition

35:10.743 --> 35:13.027
until you put Ms. Mitchell
back on a plane.

35:29.929 --> 35:30.946
How'd it go?

35:30.947 --> 35:32.230
It's not over yet.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.899
But you're out of the doghouse
with Jessica?

35:33.900 --> 35:36.318
Out.

35:36.319 --> 35:37.519
What?

35:37.520 --> 35:40.021
You never said how it went
with Manningham.

35:40.022 --> 35:44.409
And I never will.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.862
Well, if it isn't
Bonnie and Clyde.

35:46.863 --> 35:48.363
What are you doing
in my office?

35:48.364 --> 35:51.032
Well, I didn't think you cared
to respect what's yours

35:51.033 --> 35:54.119
or, more to the point,
what's mine.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.371
Your problem's not with her.
It's with me.

35:56.372 --> 35:57.756
Okay.

35:57.757 --> 35:59.791
You stole my discovery,
and you know it.

35:59.792 --> 36:01.209
Oh, you mean
that piece of paper

36:01.210 --> 36:02.594
that I turned
into a strategy?

36:02.595 --> 36:04.746
Or, as you like to call it,
an airplane.

36:04.747 --> 36:06.715
Okay, fine.

36:06.716 --> 36:09.017
I put my toe
over the line.

36:09.018 --> 36:10.418
You obliterated it.

36:10.419 --> 36:11.636
Yeah.
I'm so sorry.

36:11.637 --> 36:14.055
But yesterday you were
the fifth-year authority

36:14.056 --> 36:16.224
on right and wrong, so I...

36:16.225 --> 36:17.726
I was just taking
your advice.

36:17.727 --> 36:19.644
And which side
of right and wrong

36:19.645 --> 36:21.480
does sleeping
with the paralegals fall on?

36:21.481 --> 36:23.264
Get the hell
out of my office.

36:23.265 --> 36:25.433
You're right.

36:25.434 --> 36:28.069
That's none
of my business.

36:28.070 --> 36:30.155
But it's a good thing
you're going to law school,

36:30.156 --> 36:32.407
because they may sleep
with the paralegals,

36:32.408 --> 36:34.626
but they end up
with the lawyers.

36:37.580 --> 36:39.080
Of course,
when you called,

36:39.081 --> 36:40.832
I popped straight over,
but I must say,

36:40.833 --> 36:43.952
you do keep uncivilized hours
in the little apple.

36:43.953 --> 36:46.120
It's the Big Apple.

36:46.121 --> 36:49.057
Well, then someone's just
sold me a counterfeit T-shirt.

36:49.058 --> 36:51.476
A sense of humor--
I love that in a man,

36:51.477 --> 36:53.895
which is why
I'm prepared to consider

36:53.896 --> 36:55.313
taking you up
on your offer.

36:55.314 --> 36:58.132
Might I inquire
what changed your mind?

37:01.103 --> 37:02.320
What's this?

37:02.321 --> 37:04.773
Our books
from the last five years.

37:04.774 --> 37:06.474
If we're going to do this,
I want you to know

37:06.475 --> 37:08.910
exactly what it is
you're getting yourself into.

37:08.911 --> 37:10.495
Now, start
at the beginning.

37:10.496 --> 37:12.614
It's a great read.

37:12.615 --> 37:14.699
You are an impressive woman.

37:14.700 --> 37:17.452
Oh, you don't know
the half.

37:17.453 --> 37:21.489
Well, here's
to my further education.

37:37.339 --> 37:38.940
You're late.

37:38.941 --> 37:42.727
That's not going to get you
out of buying me a drink first.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.012
No more bullshit.

37:44.013 --> 37:45.530
What?

37:45.531 --> 37:47.399
I just left Jessica
and your boss,

37:47.400 --> 37:49.200
and I know what I saw.

37:49.201 --> 37:51.686
They're in bed together,
and I don't mean having sex.

37:51.687 --> 37:53.021
They're talking merger.

37:53.022 --> 37:54.456
It's not what it looks like.

37:54.457 --> 37:56.541
Hardman can check a plane,
and I can check a plane.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.376
Edward Darby flew here
the day you did.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.045
He didn't just pop in.

38:00.046 --> 38:01.379
He wasn't supposed
to do that.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.664
You don't want your name
on the door.

38:02.665 --> 38:03.915
You want your name
on my door.

38:03.916 --> 38:06.701
I want to see our names
on the same door.

38:06.702 --> 38:08.036
Yeah, like I said,

38:08.037 --> 38:09.838
it's never the full story
with you.

38:09.839 --> 38:10.972
I wanted to be able
to tell you myself.

38:10.973 --> 38:12.257
Then why didn't you tell me?

38:12.258 --> 38:14.142
Because he wouldn't let me
until he decided.

38:14.143 --> 38:16.210
Well, evidently,
he decided without you.

38:16.211 --> 38:17.545
Okay, okay.
He jumped the gun.

38:17.546 --> 38:19.264
But I have his promise,
Harvey.

38:19.265 --> 38:21.066
If we merge,
he names me as partner,

38:21.067 --> 38:24.152
and Jessica's only choice
is you.

38:24.153 --> 38:26.154
I don't need you
to get my name on the door

38:26.155 --> 38:28.356
any more than I need you
to win this case.

38:28.357 --> 38:29.891
You know what, Harvey?

38:29.892 --> 38:32.226
You have been outgunned
ever since Hardman left.

38:32.227 --> 38:33.612
I am bringing the guns.

38:33.613 --> 38:35.363
This is exactly
what you've always wanted.

38:35.364 --> 38:36.448
Get over your pride.

38:36.449 --> 38:39.000
I'm not getting
over anything.

38:39.001 --> 38:41.736
And this merger
isn't happening.

38:54.300 --> 38:57.018
Jessica.
Edward.

38:57.019 --> 38:59.921
Daniel, haven't seen you
since that business in Milan.

38:59.922 --> 39:01.640
- Beautiful weather.
- Oh, enough.

39:01.641 --> 39:03.441
We are not
friendly adversaries, Daniel.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.859
And you're about to lose.

39:04.860 --> 39:06.427
My client already said no.

39:06.428 --> 39:08.446
He may no longer
listen to you

39:08.447 --> 39:10.598
when I inform him
of your prior embezzlement.

39:10.599 --> 39:12.901
You told him.

39:12.902 --> 39:14.936
I didn't tell him anything.

39:14.937 --> 39:16.821
I found it on my own.

39:16.822 --> 39:19.407
Edward and I are merging.
I had to show him the books.

39:19.408 --> 39:22.243
Legally required
to show me her books.

39:22.244 --> 39:24.946
And unlike you,
I don't break the law.

39:24.947 --> 39:28.833
A fact that Hanley Folsom
could be made acutely aware of.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.553
You do break the law,
Jessica.

39:31.554 --> 39:33.555
Not reporting embezzlement
is a crime.

39:33.556 --> 39:36.841
Why don't you bring that up
at your sentencing hearing?

39:36.842 --> 39:38.510
Why don't I sue you?

39:38.511 --> 39:41.796
You could.

39:41.797 --> 39:43.732
Anybody could sue anybody.

39:43.733 --> 39:45.600
But you still don't have proof
that I told him.

39:45.601 --> 39:47.769
And our firms combined
have ten times

39:47.770 --> 39:50.155
the resources
that yours d--

39:50.156 --> 39:52.991
Oh, wait.
You don't have a firm.

39:52.992 --> 39:56.277
You're just here,
living in Zane's offices,

39:56.278 --> 39:58.813
working on those cases
that will no longer be yours

39:58.814 --> 40:02.150
when we're done with you.

40:02.151 --> 40:05.120
Good-bye, Daniel.

40:06.922 --> 40:09.323
Oh...

40:09.324 --> 40:13.511
Get your client
to sign those papers, will you?

40:37.953 --> 40:40.021
What is it, Louis?

40:40.022 --> 40:43.208
Got a hard truth
to tell you.

40:45.411 --> 40:49.363
- I'm not going to Harvard.
- No, you're not.

40:49.364 --> 40:50.531
I get it.

40:50.532 --> 40:53.001
I'm not good enough.
I never have been.

40:53.002 --> 40:54.636
That is not the hard truth.

40:54.637 --> 40:56.137
You are an amazing candidate,

40:56.138 --> 40:58.173
and you need to know this
in your heart.

40:58.174 --> 41:02.510
The truth is,
you did not get in...

41:02.511 --> 41:04.062
Because I let you down.

41:08.734 --> 41:10.885
What are you talking about?

41:10.886 --> 41:13.688
Sheila and I
had a relationship.

41:13.689 --> 41:17.108
I hurt her, and...

41:17.109 --> 41:19.694
And she took it out
on me?

41:19.695 --> 41:21.696
I'm going to write you
a recommendation for anywhere,

41:21.697 --> 41:23.748
any law school.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.033
It just...

41:25.034 --> 41:27.085
Won't be Harvard.

41:42.434 --> 41:45.436
I'm really sorry.
