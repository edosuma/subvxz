00:16.480 --> 00:19.120
lt's a blip. A shadow on the ultrasound.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.960
Too deep to tell.
You know, maybe a dead seal.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.640
Anyway, we're gonna rule it out
and pack up for the season.

00:26.760 --> 00:32.240
Another week or two, it'll be dark most of
the time, much too cold to work outside.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.680
As far as coming back next year,
well, it's not up to me.

00:35.760 --> 00:40.160
The Pentagon re-evaluates our presence
here every year. Take it up with them.

00:40.280 --> 00:44.560
Maybe my conclusions about the DHD
will convince them we should continue.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.200
I´m sure coming from you
it'll hold more weight.

00:47.320 --> 00:51.360
The one found with the Antarctic gate
died shortly after it was brought back.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.160
lt was used a few times
and then just ran out of energy.

00:54.240 --> 00:58.960
That was the first indication that the
power sources have a limited life span.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.440
We've run a number of tests comparing
the power source to other offworld DHDs.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.120
We think we have evidence
that the gate down there

01:06.200 --> 01:08.400
is one of the oldest in the entire system.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.120
lt could be as much
as 50 million years old.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.960
The Antarctic plate wasn't
covered by a glacier back then.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.440
The gate didn't
necessarily originate there.

01:17.520 --> 01:21.760
lt could have been moved at any time.
That's what we need to try and determine.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.600
How?

01:23.720 --> 01:27.360
There has to be
something else down there.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.520
We've been here four years running.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.120
Since we dug out those two Jaffa
we've found nothing.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.760
- lf this latest lead turns out to...
- Michaels, the thing in the ice.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.880
lt's something.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.520
Why's the plane leaving?

02:51.640 --> 02:54.400
The cold's no good for
the electronics. lt'll be back.

02:54.520 --> 02:57.120
- When?
- Let's ask these folks.

02:57.240 --> 03:02.000
- Hi. Nice to finally meet you, Major.
- You too. Dr Michaels, Dr Fraiser.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.720
Drs Woods and Osbourne.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.560
- All right. That's enough.
- Welcome to Antarctica, Colonel.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.680
- Thanks. Great to be back.
- Let's go inside.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.960
- How long's this gonna take?
- A few days, maybe more. Why?

03:15.040 --> 03:18.160
- Long-range forecast isn't good.
- Bit of a weather freak.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.320
He'll love it here.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.920
Leave your coats on. The lab's below
freezing to maintain the specimen.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.480
We thought
you'd wanna see it right away.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.640
As you can see, we're well-equipped.
We have a research lab,

03:36.760 --> 03:39.200
observation room,

03:39.320 --> 03:42.920
and in here... the quarantine lab.

03:50.680 --> 03:56.080
After digging up those Jaffa the first year,
we expected to find a lot more a lot faster.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.080
l named her Ayiana.
lt means ''eternal bloom''.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.680
- Native American lndian?
- My grandfather was a quarter Cherokee.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.920
- How do you know it's a ''she''?
- Ultrasound.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.800
- You're guessing.
- The form appears to be female.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.280
Although, l admit, it's hard to tell for sure.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.000
Have you made a guess about her age?

04:16.120 --> 04:17.440
25 to 35.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.839
Give or take several million years.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.160
Several million?

04:22.240 --> 04:26.080
That's what the analysis of
the oxygen content in the ice indicates.

04:26.160 --> 04:30.280
But didn't humans evolve on this planet
between 800,000 and 900,000 years ago?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.880
- That's what we thought.
- This could be big.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
As you said, evidence points to the
Stargate found here predating the glacier.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.840
The Jaffa could not have been
frozen there that long ago.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.160
Not even close.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.360
Dr Jackson theorised that when the gate
from Giza was buried 2,000 years ago,

04:45.480 --> 04:47.760
that the Goa'uld
opened the Antarctic gate.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.560
A crevasse formed.
lt allowed the wormhole to connect

04:50.640 --> 04:52.480
and create a larger opening.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.920
- The Jaffa were frozen after that.
- But she wasn't.

04:56.040 --> 04:59.520
- Much before that.
- So she's neither Jaffa nor Goa'uld.

04:59.600 --> 05:04.560
Well, she was probably around when
the Antarctic gate was first being used.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.720
We need more core samples to determine
if she was frozen in the same vein.

05:08.840 --> 05:12.440
- Did you do a tissue sample?
- Mm-hm. l'd like you to have a look.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.160
Listen, could somebody
bottom-line this for me?

05:15.240 --> 05:17.200
We could be looking at evidence

05:17.320 --> 05:20.560
that human beings evolved
long before we thought they did.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.840
And maybe not even
originally on this planet.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.560
Darwin would be crushed.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.520
Doh

05:32.480 --> 05:36.080
- What is it, O'Neill?
- l forgot to tape The Simpsons.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.680
lt's important to me.

05:47.960 --> 05:52.080
- This is incredible.
- l know. No adipocere.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.240
What's that?

05:54.320 --> 05:59.360
lt's a residue that forms on dead
animal tissue when exposed to moisture.

05:59.480 --> 06:03.920
But that's not the most amazing part.
These tissue cells are intact.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.840
That's what l was hoping you'd say.
l thought maybe l was losing my mind.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.880
I´m sorry. What...?

06:10.960 --> 06:15.120
When you freeze live cells, crystals form
and destroy the integrity of the cell.

06:15.240 --> 06:19.120
That's why we haven't been able to
develop human cryogenic preservation.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.960
- So...
- So, these cells are perfect.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.920
They could be from you or me.

07:02.440 --> 07:06.560
Right hand, right arm
and partial head exposed.

07:06.680 --> 07:10.360
The clothing appears tailored.
Material unknown.

07:11.040 --> 07:17.120
Peeling back what appears to be
the right sleeve covering the face.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.400
- You got it?
- Yeah.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.760
She is remarkably preserved.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.240
l got a cortical response.
Sam, l need your help.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.480
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

07:48.600 --> 07:52.000
Electroencephalogram.
lt measures brain-wave activity.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.400
Go, Sam.

08:01.640 --> 08:02.840
Delta waves.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.880
- lmpossible.
- We've seen stranger.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.920
- We gotta get her out.
- Sir, crank up the heat.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.240
On three.
When you're ready, Jonas.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.720
One, two, three.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.800
Easy.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.720
OK.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.840
- Temperature is 73°.
- Good.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.799
No sign of frostbite.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.080
- l assume you don't have bypass?
- No.

08:45.200 --> 08:49.920
Let's try warm saline,
one milligram epi, and do a blood gas.

08:53.080 --> 08:57.440
The medics have a saying here- ''You're
not dead till you're warm and dead.''

08:57.520 --> 09:02.240
lt's because anything below 82°
and life signs are often undetectable.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.680
We've got disorganised electrical activity.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.120
I´m intubating.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.120
Tilt her head, Sam.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.680
I´m in. Give me the tube.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.600
That's it.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.440
OK.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.600
There's a heartbeat.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.080
Hey. She's bleeding.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.000
- Sam, will you take over bagging?
- Got it.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.120
pH is 6.9.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.760
She's acidotic but her PO2 is 98.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.360
Ten beats per minute.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.920
She's in V-fib.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.440
Charging to 200.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.960
And clear.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.200
Wait

09:57.960 --> 10:00.080
Sinus bradycardia.

10:00.160 --> 10:04.080
30 beats per minute.
BP's 60 over 40 and rising.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.520
l can't believe this is happening.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.320
She's conscious.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.000
She's breathing on her own.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.920
I think we're scaring her.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.920
lt's OK. lt's OK. lt's OK.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.640
- Can we take the tube out?
- Yeah.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.520
lt's OK. Sam, give me a hand.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.400
Easy. Easy. Hang on.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.280
Take it easy.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.200
lt's OK. lt's OK.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.960
There you go.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.200
Michaels, 2.5mg Valium.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.680
Easy. Nobody's gonna hurt you. lt's OK.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.400
OK. Here we go.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.680
Here we go. Yeah.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.000
We didn't do anything, sir.
She revived herself.

11:14.120 --> 11:17.800
lt was as if the thawing process
just triggered an internal response

11:17.920 --> 11:21.280
telling her body to come back to life.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.760
- But not a snake-head, right?
- No, sir.

11:23.840 --> 11:27.760
- Then what are we dealin' with here?
- Something not humanly possible.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.640
- Not as far as l know.
- She may indeed be not of this world.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
As far as we knew up until now,
all human life in the galaxy

11:36.120 --> 11:39.440
was transplanted to other planets
from Earth by the Goa'uld.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.000
The odds of a totally alien life form

11:42.080 --> 11:46.320
evolving to look exactly
like us are astronomical.

11:46.400 --> 11:51.200
Actually, if she's as old as we think she is,
wouldn't it be us evolving to look like her?

11:51.280 --> 11:53.760
- True.
- We need to check out the site again.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.480
Get another core sample
to prove the age of the ice.

11:56.560 --> 11:59.200
- You guys need some help?
- We can handle it.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.800
She's awake again.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.080
Think l'll try talking to her.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.480
Hey.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.160
lt's...

12:30.440 --> 12:31.640
Jonas.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.200
Francine.

12:35.320 --> 12:38.640
We don't need these restraints
any more, do we?

12:40.840 --> 12:42.800
lt's all right.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.840
lt's better, huh? Wanna sit her up?

13:00.320 --> 13:02.320
Can you speak?

13:03.240 --> 13:05.040
Speak?

13:05.160 --> 13:07.600
Maybe she just doesn't understand us.

13:07.720 --> 13:13.040
l'd be very surprised if she did, but that
doesn't mean we can't communicate.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.640
I´m Jonas.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.600
Jonas. lt's my name.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.000
Jon... Jonas.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.360
Yeah.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.440
l guess she can speak.

13:28.880 --> 13:34.000
Jonas, though, Jonas is my name.
lt's my name.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.720
Francine is her name.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.040
Do you have a name?

13:42.000 --> 13:46.080
- ls that bothering you?
- That's my fault. I´m sorry.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.120
S.. sorry?

13:49.200 --> 13:54.040
lt's what you say to somebody when
you have caused them pain or sadness,

13:54.160 --> 13:57.680
- or done something you feel bad about.
- We didn't know.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.880
Let me have a look. lt's OK.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.840
That's amazing.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.680
Amazing.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.200
Yes. You are.

14:25.600 --> 14:29.280
Amazing.

14:38.560 --> 14:43.120
The weather system is blowing in
more quickly than first predicted.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.360
Woods, Osbourne.
This is O'Neill. Come in.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.440
Yeah, Colonel. l read you.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.680
That storm is headed our way.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.560
Roger. We're almost done.
lt'll be dark soon anyway.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.440
Be back in a couple of hours. Woods out.

14:57.680 --> 15:00.400
Well, we didn't really learn anything.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.440
- Nothing?
- No, not even her name.

15:03.520 --> 15:07.760
There's obviously a communication
barrier. She can speak, but...

15:07.840 --> 15:11.120
There's no telling what the effects
of being frozen that long are.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.840
Even with her ability
to preserve or heal herself physically,

15:14.960 --> 15:17.360
her mind could have been
damaged beyond repair.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.520
The wound on her arm
is completely gone.

15:19.640 --> 15:20.480
What?

15:20.600 --> 15:22.880
lf we can figure out
how she regenerates...

15:22.960 --> 15:25.760
Could she not be
deliberately hiding something?

15:25.880 --> 15:28.320
What reason would she have
to hide anything?

15:28.400 --> 15:30.240
Fear.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.280
Thought you might be hungry.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.320
l brought you some food.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.280
You eat it.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.320
lt's not very good, but...

15:59.880 --> 16:01.840
Try it.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.040
That's not much...

16:14.600 --> 16:16.560
better.

16:17.280 --> 16:21.040
l guess if you've been frozen
for that many years...

16:27.440 --> 16:29.200
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

16:29.320 --> 16:33.360
l just think we have the heat
turned up a little high in here now.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.080
l wanna show you something.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.160
Here. Look.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.040
Have you ever seen this?

16:46.280 --> 16:48.320
Yes or no?

16:49.800 --> 16:52.160
Amazing.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.840
We're gonna try something else.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.920
- Look at this.
- What are they?

17:06.000 --> 17:10.240
EEGs l took of Cassandra
after Nirrti's genetic experiment.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.920
Cassie started developing
telekinetic abilities.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.319
These are of O'Neill

17:14.400 --> 17:18.319
with the knowledge of the Ancient
repository downloaded in his brain.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.839
Now, l've been
comparing them to Ayiana's.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.319
Connection.

17:27.359 --> 17:31.040
Nirrti was trying to create
genetically enhanced human beings.

17:31.120 --> 17:34.240
The Ancient device was rewriting
Colonel O'Neill's memory.

17:34.320 --> 17:38.000
lt was doing more than that. lt was
activating dormant areas of his brain.

17:38.080 --> 17:43.440
Sam, look. What if there's more than just a
coincidental similarity in these patterns?

17:43.560 --> 17:44.880
So this woman is...

17:45.000 --> 17:50.320
She's another example of an advanced
stage in the human evolutionary process.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.880
Leading to what?

17:56.600 --> 18:01.040
Antarctic cod can live in water so cold
other fish'd develop ice in their blood.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.480
They've had 40 million years
to adapt to the change of temperature

18:04.600 --> 18:07.520
and developed this protein
that acts like antifreeze.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.320
They're fish.

18:09.400 --> 18:13.520
Given enough time, evolution
can do some pretty amazing things.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.320
We know humans can become
much more powerful beings.

18:16.400 --> 18:20.160
- We've seen it happen with Daniel.
- With the help of other powerful beings.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.520
Yes.

18:21.640 --> 18:25.920
This woman might predate human
evolution on Earth by 50 million years.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.680
That would put her behind us in
the evolutionary time line, not way ahead.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.440
Unless...

18:31.560 --> 18:35.120
Unless our evolution
isn't the first time it's happened.

18:36.040 --> 18:40.560
- That's not big. That's huge.
- lt's just a theory. We have no evidence.

18:40.640 --> 18:45.040
But if you're right, this woman could be
part of the race that invented the gate.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.080
- One stage of their development, anyway.
- A living Ancient.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.520
And we look like her.

18:49.600 --> 18:54.000
That could mean that our evolution
wasn't just some biological accident.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.000
Dr Fraiser/

19:10.360 --> 19:15.040
Michaels fainted. She's running
a high fever. l need to do more tests.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.480
- Ayiana?
- She's fine.

19:18.520 --> 19:21.280
- l know what you're thinking.
- And?

19:22.360 --> 19:25.360
lt's possible she may be carrying
a contagion of some kind.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.280
Would she not also be ill?

19:27.360 --> 19:32.000
There are diseases that have no effect
on the carrier but can still infect others.

19:32.120 --> 19:36.440
lt may be that her healing abilities
are fighting off the infection

19:36.520 --> 19:38.720
without eradicating it completely.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.440
Should Jonas still be in there?

19:41.520 --> 19:46.520
He wants to be. Chances are he's already
been exposed. lt's possible we all have.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.800
lf this did come from her, we need
to know as much as she can tell us.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.800
C-130 is scheduled
to pick us up tomorrow.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.240
- Better call it off.
- They can't fly in this weather anyway.

19:56.360 --> 20:01.480
Until l know a lot more about
what's going on here, we're quarantined.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.560
Woods, Osbourne.
This is O'Neill. Come in.

20:17.600 --> 20:21.440
Osbourne, Woods.
This is O'Neill. Come in.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.920
- How is she?
- Not good.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.440
Fever won't come down.
She's not responding to antibiotics.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.760
Whatever this is, it's fast.

20:31.880 --> 20:35.120
Woods and Osbourne
aren't responding on the radio.

20:35.240 --> 20:39.680
lf they've developed the same symptoms,
they could be weak or even passed out.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.160
You definitely think
this came from Ayiana?

20:42.280 --> 20:48.080
Well, Michaels has been affected first, and
she was working with the tissue sample.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.080
Help

21:09.400 --> 21:12.080
- Core samples.
- Where's Woods?

21:13.280 --> 21:17.280
Got separated. l hoped
he'd have made his way back here.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.680
- The snowcat?
- lt's stuck in a drift.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.760
lt's minus 30. He won't last long.

21:21.880 --> 21:26.200
He's running a high temperature.
Help me get him back to the barracks.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.360
Sam, I´m gonna need your help.

21:41.480 --> 21:44.480
Hopefully Woods activated his EPlRB.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.440
- Stay in radio contact.
- Roger that.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.600
Dr Woods is lost.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.920
O'Neill and Teal'c
went out there to find him.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.600
Hope they do.

22:35.720 --> 22:39.840
Dr Michaels and Dr Osbourne
are both sick.

22:39.960 --> 22:44.160
Dr Fraiser thinks that we may have been...

22:44.240 --> 22:48.000
infected by some disease
that you're carrying.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.960
Eventually we're all gonna be very sick.

22:51.040 --> 22:56.000
But... you have no idea
what I´m talking about, so...

23:03.360 --> 23:05.360
Do you?

23:10.480 --> 23:12.840
You can understand me?

23:17.360 --> 23:19.720
You're a quicker study than l am.

23:21.720 --> 23:26.640
So is there anything at all that you can
tell me about this disease you're carrying,

23:26.760 --> 23:29.200
why you're not sick?

23:29.680 --> 23:33.040
You don't know?
You don't remember anything?

23:34.480 --> 23:37.840
Do you know how
you're able to heal yourself?

23:44.000 --> 23:48.640
l'll boost the dose of antibiotic, but there's
no sign of bacterial growth in the culture.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.360
lf this is a virus,
there is nothing else l can do.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.880
- How much time do they have?
- Days, hours. l don't know.

23:54.960 --> 23:59.440
Michaels' kidneys have started
to shut down, and that's a bad sign.

23:59.520 --> 24:03.760
The ice core sample places Ayiana
in the same vein as the Stargate.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.160
She's at least three million years old.

24:06.240 --> 24:10.160
But if she's from a race that predates
the glacier and your theory is correct,

24:10.240 --> 24:12.160
she could be a lot older.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.600
Carter, come in.

24:17.080 --> 24:21.120
- Colonel, this is Carter.
- We've found the abandoned cat.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.360
We'll continue the search on foot.

24:23.480 --> 24:27.920
Visibility is near zero and l keep losing
the satellite lock on the tracker.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.720
The cold must be affecting
the antenna on your SatNav.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.160
We'll keep looking. O'Neill out.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.560
Dr Woods

24:39.280 --> 24:41.280
Dr Woods

24:42.280 --> 24:43.760
Dr Woods

24:54.800 --> 24:56.880
- lt's unbelievable.
- What?

24:56.960 --> 25:00.000
She understands
everything I´m saying. Everything.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.520
l told her exactly what's been happening

25:02.640 --> 25:07.760
and she seems to know that she's
responsible for it, like it's her fault.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.560
- She told you that?
- Not in so many words, no.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.920
What about something that could help us?

25:14.040 --> 25:17.600
Not yet, but it doesn't mean
that her memory won't come back.

25:17.720 --> 25:20.560
The mind will take
longer than the body to heal.

25:20.640 --> 25:24.000
The problem is, Jonas,
we don't know how much time we have.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.160
Right.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.520
O'Neill

25:49.800 --> 25:51.840
Let's get him into the lab.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.880
On three. One, two, three

25:56.520 --> 25:59.840
He's in hypothermic shock.
We need to get his clothes off.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.880
We need to get him
wrapped in warm blankets.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.880
Sam, l need you
to hook him up onto the monitor.

26:24.520 --> 26:26.480
This can't be good.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.320
Oh, my God.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.040
He's in V-fib.

26:43.120 --> 26:46.640
You get the paddles, l'll get the gel.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.440
Charge to 200.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.640
OK. Everybody clear

26:57.640 --> 26:59.040
Whoa Hey

27:00.040 --> 27:02.640
- No, no, no. Wait. Wait.
- Jonas.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.280
Let's see. Let's see what she does.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.360
Wait.

27:42.920 --> 27:45.040
His vital signs are back to normal.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.640
You OK?

28:18.640 --> 28:21.000
Do you know what you did?

28:25.960 --> 28:28.560
Do you know how you did it?

28:35.680 --> 28:38.240
Can you do it again?

28:40.080 --> 28:42.880
Dr Michaels and Dr Osbourne are both...

28:44.120 --> 28:47.120
They're in very bad shape.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.920
And if you can't help them...

29:32.080 --> 29:34.240
Guess it worked.

29:34.320 --> 29:38.000
So this is good, right?
When she wakes up, she can zap us all?

29:38.120 --> 29:41.840
Not necessarily.
Healing them really exhausted her.

29:51.320 --> 29:55.520
- What is it, Janet?
- lt's a blood sample from Ayiana.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.240
l'll know more in a little while.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.640
Hey, are you OK?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.320
Yeah.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.960
What do you think the problem is?

30:07.040 --> 30:09.840
Whatever or however
she's able to do what she does,

30:09.920 --> 30:12.480
it weakens her more each time.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.360
She's still carrying that virus herself, Sam.

30:15.440 --> 30:19.920
I´m afraid there's gonna be a point
where she puts herself at risk.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.360
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

30:31.960 --> 30:37.120
OK. l can't say for sure, but
her white-cell count is down significantly.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.000
White blood cells are a major part
of our immune system,

30:40.120 --> 30:42.320
and she's still basically human.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.600
What does that mean?

30:45.680 --> 30:49.360
You, me, Sam and Jonas will get
a lot worse over the next day or so,

30:49.480 --> 30:53.000
and l don't know what will happen
if we let her try to heal us.

30:53.360 --> 30:55.840
She could die.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.880
She could save some of us
or all of us. Who knows?

30:58.960 --> 31:01.600
Maybe she just needs time
to get her strength back.

31:01.720 --> 31:05.680
Well, for the moment, none of us are in
dire need, so l suggest we get some rest.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.280
l will stand watch.

31:07.400 --> 31:11.120
No. lf you don't kelno'reem, your
immune system will be vulnerable too.

31:11.240 --> 31:14.480
- We'll watch her.
- Yeah. lt's the least we can do.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.600
l'll run some tests on us,
looking for antibody markers.

31:17.720 --> 31:21.760
Hopefully whatever she did to us
means we're now immune to reinfection.

31:21.840 --> 31:25.520
And the rest of us'll get some sleep.
That's an order.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.720
Hi.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.800
Thank you.

31:48.680 --> 31:51.200
You saved my life.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.600
l have to admit, l feel a little guilty,

31:55.720 --> 32:00.560
being OK while Colonel O'Neill
and the rest of them keep getting sicker.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.480
lf we could just figure out how...

32:45.640 --> 32:48.200
The storm is passing.

32:48.280 --> 32:53.200
Good. Maybe now we'll be able
to get a disease-control team in here.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.640
- I´m gonna relieve Woods.
- OK.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.400
Norm, wake up.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.480
Norm...

33:16.440 --> 33:19.440
She's missing. Woods is unconscious.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.760
Check there.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.280
lt's OK, it's OK.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.880
He's burning up.

33:56.360 --> 33:59.520
You're gonna be fine, sir. l'll see you soon.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.360
Even though you don't have the disease,
you could still carry the virus.

34:17.440 --> 34:21.440
We'll all get properly cleared
once we get back to the SGC.

34:29.320 --> 34:34.719
Blood pressure's holding 80 over 40. Get
me the results of his latest blood work.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.800
- How's he doing?
- They're doing everything they can, sir.

34:38.920 --> 34:42.239
We talked to the Tok'ra. They said
this might be beyond their help.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.920
- They're sending someone anyway.
- His best chance is Ayiana, sir.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.800
She managed to halt
the virus in the rest of us.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.880
Why can't she stop it in herself?

34:51.000 --> 34:57.040
The virus acts like cerebrospinal
meningitis, by attacking the brain.

34:57.160 --> 35:01.880
Despite the physical similarities, Ayiana's
brain chemistry is different from ours.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.200
lt's possible she's able to trigger
an immune response in us

35:05.320 --> 35:09.040
that she can't muster in herself
once the disease reaches an end stage.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.840
What are the odds she'll survive?

35:35.320 --> 35:37.360
Hey.

35:37.480 --> 35:40.720
Glad to see you're awake.

35:40.800 --> 35:44.640
l had a feeling that
you were gonna make it.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.720
Thanks for what you did for me.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.880
You didn't have to do that.
Not for any of us.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.000
Take it easy.

36:01.640 --> 36:05.760
Gotta get your strength back.
Colonel O'Neill still needs your help.

36:05.880 --> 36:11.040
More than that, we want you to live.
l want you to live.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.680
Sorry.

36:24.320 --> 36:26.560
Ayiana

36:34.480 --> 36:37.200
- She just...
- Bag her.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.680
Give me one milligram epi.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.200
Charging to 200.

36:45.560 --> 36:47.520
Clear

36:50.120 --> 36:52.720
Nothing. Charging to 300.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.880
Clear

36:58.640 --> 37:00.920
Come on, come on.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.880
Again. Clear

37:03.880 --> 37:06.560
His condition is beyond
the healing of a hand device.

37:06.680 --> 37:10.360
However, there is a symbiote
who is in dire need of a host.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.840
What happened?

37:11.920 --> 37:14.800
The former host was
mortally wounded on assignment

37:14.920 --> 37:17.280
and the symbiote was unable to heal him.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.240
We believe that would not be
the case with Colonel O'Neill.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.760
Physical trauma is much more difficult
to deal with than disease.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.440
Colonel O'Neill would not choose
to become a Tok'ra.

37:26.520 --> 37:29.280
l am aware of the colonel's
dislike for our kind.

37:29.360 --> 37:33.360
However, l am surprised that you think
he would choose death over blending.

37:40.200 --> 37:45.640
Ayiana's dead. Dr Fraiser
did everything she could, but...

37:45.760 --> 37:49.200
She may have been
on borrowed time from the start.

37:50.800 --> 37:54.720
Jonas, this is Thoran of the Tok'ra.
Thoran, this is Jonas Quinn.

37:54.840 --> 37:58.640
The Tok'ra are offering a symbiote
in hopes that it can heal Colonel O'Neill.

37:58.760 --> 38:02.240
- What does Colonel O'Neill have to say?
- Colonel O'Neill's in a coma.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.680
The fact is, we may be in the position
of having to decide for him.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.120
How can we do that?

38:07.200 --> 38:11.040
No Tok'ra symbiote would choose to
blend with an unwilling host permanently.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.880
- What about a temporary arrangement?
- What do you mean?

38:13.960 --> 38:16.120
The symbiote Kanan
is someone l know well.

38:16.200 --> 38:20.960
l have no doubt that he would blend with
O'Neill, cure him and leave him again,

38:21.040 --> 38:23.320
if another suitable host can be found.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.400
lf not?

38:24.520 --> 38:29.440
He would ultimately sacrifice himself
rather than remain with an unwilling host.

38:29.560 --> 38:33.040
Kanan's former host died
before he was able to reveal the details

38:33.160 --> 38:38.000
of what we believe was vital intelligence
about the undercover mission he was on.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.920
l cannot stress enough
how important that information could be.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.360
Sir, we all wanna do anything we can
to help Colonel O'Neill.

38:45.480 --> 38:50.480
But l really think we at least have to give
him the opportunity to decide for himself.

39:08.760 --> 39:12.360
I´m administering .1 epi.
l don't know if this is going to work.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.560
Will it hurt him?

39:14.680 --> 39:16.640
Can't get much worse.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.400
Sir, l don't know if you can hear me.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.880
The Tok'ra have offered you a deal.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.640
There's a symbiote that needs a host.

39:33.720 --> 39:38.000
They think it could cure you.
Now, it may be your only chance.

39:39.800 --> 39:45.280
lt would only be temporary. lt would come
out as soon as they found another host.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.040
Sir, are you getting any of this?

39:58.720 --> 40:00.720
Carter.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.160
Yeah, I´m right here.

40:04.120 --> 40:06.800
Over my dead body.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.960
Sir, the symbiote's host died
while they were on a mission.

40:13.040 --> 40:16.960
The Tok'ra have reason to believe the
symbiote has vital information to reveal

40:17.040 --> 40:19.760
and this would give him that chance.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.760
They promised that if no other host was
found within a reasonable amount of time,

40:23.840 --> 40:28.800
the symbiote would sacrifice itself
rather than stay in an unwilling host.

40:29.680 --> 40:31.640
Sir, please.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.160
