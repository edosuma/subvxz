WEBVTT

00:16.015 --> 00:18.326
Mr. Aidikoff,
can you open the door?

00:19.886 --> 00:22.628
Mr. Aidikoff, we have a warrant.
Open the door.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.467
Mr. Aidikoff?

00:26.359 --> 00:27.463
FEMALE NEWSREADER:
Facing arrest this morning,

00:27.527 --> 00:29.700
Bernard Aidikoff
allegedly shot himself

00:29.763 --> 00:31.071
on the top floor of the building

00:31.131 --> 00:33.372
where his investment
group had their offices.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.949
Federal investigators believe the
massive fraud began as early as 1993.

00:38.271 --> 00:40.217
The amount missing from
client accounts so far,

00:40.273 --> 00:41.775
including unsubstantiated gains,

00:41.841 --> 00:44.344
has totaled over
35 billion dollars.

00:51.785 --> 00:52.855
Arthur.

00:52.919 --> 00:55.365
Spencer, we have to talk.
Aidikoff killed himself.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.629
I mean, he just killed
himself in his office.

00:57.690 --> 00:58.760
It's all over the news.

00:58.825 --> 01:02.432
He took our money, he took all the
money and he just killed himself.

01:02.495 --> 01:04.532
There's nothing. Calm down.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.577
It's gone! It's all gone!

01:06.633 --> 01:10.080
Listen to me. Go home,
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

01:52.912 --> 01:56.325
Oh, my God, Arthur.
I didn't hear you come home.

01:56.983 --> 01:58.257
How do I look?

02:00.086 --> 02:01.190
For the charity ball.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.428
Well?

02:08.094 --> 02:09.334
You look incredible.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.102
Well, I should hope so.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.810
Now you stay right here.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.118
I have more to show you.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.623
Arthur?

02:31.184 --> 02:33.664
He was making us 20% to 30% a year.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.257
At least that's what he said.
You know, you read those reports.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.332
You put everything with Aidikoff?

02:38.391 --> 02:41.338
Yes, except what's in the
checking and savings accounts,

02:41.394 --> 02:43.567
but you know us.
We're not exactly frugal.

02:43.630 --> 02:44.904
What about the company funds?

02:44.964 --> 02:47.774
I moved everything over to
Aidikoff six months ago.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.041
Every penny is invested with him.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.310
I even borrowed against the house.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.147
Oh, my God.

02:55.141 --> 02:58.122
I have a huge margin call
coming in three days.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.385
I haven't told Lucinda anything.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.884
Don't. Not yet.

03:04.217 --> 03:08.165
Not until we look at...
Look at all of our options.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.095
I can't. You think
you have a choice?

03:13.626 --> 03:15.503
I can't go to her stepmother.

03:16.996 --> 03:18.339
Arthur!

03:19.599 --> 03:21.306
What are you doing down here?

03:22.035 --> 03:26.177
Spencer, I didn't know
you were coming over.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.580
Oh, Arthur didn't tell me.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.713
Why didn't you tell me,
you bad boy?

03:32.478 --> 03:34.389
Well, what do you think?

03:34.447 --> 03:36.552
Beautiful, as always.

03:41.521 --> 03:44.559
I am sorry, Arthur.
I have to say no.

03:45.491 --> 03:47.266
Mavis. Please.

03:47.327 --> 03:50.536
Spencer, let me deal with
my son-in-law. Thank you.

03:52.165 --> 03:56.636
While I understand the desperate
circumstances of your situation,

03:56.703 --> 03:58.774
they are of your own doing.

03:58.838 --> 04:01.648
You trusted the wrong people
for the wrong reasons.

04:01.774 --> 04:04.812
And you come to me only because
you suddenly find yourself

04:05.144 --> 04:06.521
in need of money.

04:07.380 --> 04:11.260
It has been a year since
your marriage to Lucinda

04:11.317 --> 04:15.390
and I have yet to be invited
to your house even once.

04:17.190 --> 04:21.935
I'm not interested in explanations
or excuses and neither should you be.

04:22.962 --> 04:26.273
And I am sorry, but that is all
the time I have to give you.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.243
I have back-to-back meetings.

04:32.238 --> 04:34.218
Give my love to Lucinda.

04:39.078 --> 04:42.548
If it wasn't for Henry's money,
you'd still be cutting hair in Beaverton.

04:44.884 --> 04:49.856
I'm a little shocked you've taken this
godfather role so seriously, Spencer.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.930
I think it would be
good for all of you

04:52.992 --> 04:55.734
to face a little
reality for a change.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.265
She is not asking for anything
that is not rightfully hers.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.445
Henry married me.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.978
He may have given me
a very good start,

05:04.037 --> 05:06.278
but I earned every
dollar after that.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.910
Now, Lucinda's loss is not mine.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.817
She's a big girl now and it's time
for her to take responsibility

05:12.879 --> 05:15.120
for her own life and
that of her husband.

05:15.515 --> 05:16.892
I promised her father...

05:16.949 --> 05:18.587
Get a life

05:18.951 --> 05:20.453
of your own.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.566
Listen to me.

08:09.622 --> 08:13.502
Two people were killed in Rhinebeck,
New York, 18 years ago.

08:14.126 --> 08:15.730
Reed and Kelly Burkhardt.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.468
Nick, wake up,
you're having a nightmare.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.733
Nick.

08:23.736 --> 08:26.444
I don't know what you were dreaming about,
but it could not have been good.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.712
No, no.

08:28.641 --> 08:29.779
It wasn't.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.385
You want to tell me?

08:34.447 --> 08:36.484
I was dreaming about my
parents and the accident.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.260
I'm sorry.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.332
You know, it's just this...

08:41.754 --> 08:44.200
One of those things
that never leaves you.

08:44.290 --> 08:47.032
I can't imagine how terrible
it must have been for you.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.878
For the first few years,

08:55.134 --> 08:56.636
I wished I was in
the car with them.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.506
You know, thank God for my aunt.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.984
You know, she's a lot like my mom.

09:02.608 --> 09:03.609
Hmm.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.279
And without her, I'd...

09:07.480 --> 09:09.084
I don't think I would
have survived it.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.896
Hey, whatever happened to
that guy who knew your aunt?

09:14.954 --> 09:17.059
Farley Kolt or
whatever his name was.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.063
I let him go.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.935
And did he ever tell you
anything else about her?

09:22.695 --> 09:25.608
Not really. I don't even know
if he was telling me the truth.

09:26.832 --> 09:29.972
Well, we know he was in Rhinebeck
when your parents were killed.

09:30.036 --> 09:32.380
I don't know, maybe there's
something else we could find out?

09:33.172 --> 09:35.174
You want me to look
into it some more?

09:35.775 --> 09:37.311
Okay- Okay-

09:38.010 --> 09:39.080
Mmm.

10:04.870 --> 10:05.940
Hey.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.553
You staying down here all night?

10:10.376 --> 10:13.152
No, I was just thinking.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.453
Well, stop it.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.559
Thinking's no fun
this late at night.

10:24.423 --> 10:26.198
What are you worried about?

10:26.959 --> 10:28.404
The usual stuff.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.103
You don't want to tell me.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.910
I don't want you
to lose your smile.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.443
That would kill me.

10:39.939 --> 10:42.180
Well, I don't want you
to lose yours either.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.997
I called the factory,
she's not there.

10:56.055 --> 10:57.728
Where are you? In the car.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.098
Did you call the house?

10:59.191 --> 11:01.535
Yeah, I called there first,
tried her cell.

11:01.594 --> 11:02.902
She's not answering anywhere.

11:03.696 --> 11:06.040
Maybe one of us should
go over to the house.

11:06.098 --> 11:08.271
I'm at the house.
I'm just going in now.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.819
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

11:16.175 --> 11:18.280
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What?

11:25.985 --> 11:28.829
Hey. Could've been an accident.

11:30.556 --> 11:32.331
Except for the claw
marks on her face.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.893
And the exploded eyeballs,

11:33.959 --> 11:36.872
which I can't say I've seen before,
or would like to see ever again.

11:36.929 --> 11:37.999
Who found her?

11:38.064 --> 11:40.135
She has two grown daughters,
Tiffany and Taylor.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.470
Neither of them live at home.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.973
The older one, Tiffany,
called her mother this morning,

11:44.036 --> 11:45.106
couldn't get an answer.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.583
Came over to see if anything was
wrong and discovered there was.

11:47.807 --> 11:48.842
Where is she?

11:48.908 --> 11:50.410
In the dining room
with the other sister.

11:50.476 --> 11:51.853
Either of them touch
the crime scene?

11:52.178 --> 11:54.215
They were both here by
the time we arrived.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.123
Tiffany said she was too
freaked out when she saw her

11:56.182 --> 11:58.025
to do anything except dial 911.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.230
A lot of broken glass. Chandelier.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.160
What's left of it.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.933
I suppose she could
have been pushed.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.935
Maybe she jumped trying
to get away from somebody.

12:05.991 --> 12:07.436
Any sign of forced entry?

12:07.493 --> 12:09.530
No, none that we could find.
Doors and windows were locked.

12:10.429 --> 12:13.342
Well, let's take a look upstairs.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.378
Broken glass here, too.

12:16.969 --> 12:18.607
Somebody broke everything.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.575
Why would you do that?

12:20.639 --> 12:21.777
Well, to make it dark.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.445
Well, you wouldn't
break the mirror.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.379
You know, I didn't see
any cuts on her feet,

12:25.444 --> 12:26.684
so she didn't come through this.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.350
So she had to fall before
the glass was broken.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.722
Or as it was breaking.

12:31.183 --> 12:32.992
Let's talk to the daughters.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.630
I'm Detective Griffin,
this is Detective Burkhardt.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.398
We're sorry for your loss.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.703
And we were hoping you'd be up to
answering a couple of questions.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.407
All right.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.540
Do you have any idea who
might have done this?

12:53.005 --> 12:54.075
Yes.

12:54.306 --> 12:55.307
Who?

12:55.975 --> 12:58.114
Our brother-in-law, Arthur Jarvis.

12:58.177 --> 13:00.054
You have another sister?
Stepsister.

13:01.547 --> 13:02.855
Her name is Lucinda.

13:03.482 --> 13:04.984
Do they live close by?

13:05.050 --> 13:06.393
About a mile away.

13:06.652 --> 13:10.361
Arthur came here yesterday and
asked our mother for money.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.058
She turned them both down.

13:12.858 --> 13:14.303
Him and Spencer both.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.431
That would be Spencer Harrison,

13:17.096 --> 13:18.871
he's Lucinda godfather.

13:19.098 --> 13:21.510
And he pokes his nose
into everybody's business.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.376
Are they in some kind
of financial trouble?

13:24.136 --> 13:25.206
Apparently.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.649
Spencer never liked our mother.

13:28.941 --> 13:31.148
Thought she married Lucinda's
father for his money.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.451
Is this Detective Arnold Gubser?

13:35.514 --> 13:36.584
Speaking-

13:36.649 --> 13:39.255
My name's Juliette Silverton.
I'm calling from Portland.

13:39.318 --> 13:43.460
Are you the detective that investigated
the 1994 automobile accident

13:43.522 --> 13:46.025
that involved the deaths of
Kelly and Reed Burkhardt?

13:46.091 --> 13:47.627
Oh. Whoa.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.899
Ma'am, you are going
way back in time.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.066
I know.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.370
Yeah, I was the detective
assigned to that case,

13:53.232 --> 13:55.405
but, you know, I haven't thought
about it in a lot of years.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.537
Why would you be asking?

13:56.602 --> 13:58.206
I'm just doing a little
research for their son.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.510
He's actually a detective, too.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.949
With the Portland, Oregon P. D.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.576
He's just hoping for
a little closure.

14:02.641 --> 14:04.985
Yeah, as I recall there wasn't
much closure with this case.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.217
Uh, why don't you
give me his number?

14:07.279 --> 14:09.281
I'll... I'll call him
if I find out anything.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.021
That would be great.
Thank you so much.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.960
Um, his name is Nick Burkhardt...

14:24.763 --> 14:25.764
Hey, what's up?

14:25.831 --> 14:28.004
You got me. Guess who
I just talked to.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.845
Detective Arnold Gubser of the
Rhinebeck Police Department.

14:31.904 --> 14:34.441
He's the guy who investigated
your parents' car accident.

14:34.506 --> 14:35.746
He's still on the force.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.651
He's going to check his files
and he's going to call you back.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.348
How's that for first
thing in the morning?

14:39.411 --> 14:43.450
That's amazing. Wow. I should
tell you my nightmares more often.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.995
Yeah, well, you're going to wake
me up in the middle of the night,

14:46.051 --> 14:48.361
I'm going to have to
do something about it.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.831
All right, I'll talk to
you later. I love you.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.666
I love you too. Bye.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.973
Detective Burkhardt and Griffin,
Portland P.D.

15:06.338 --> 15:07.874
We're looking for Arthur Jarvis.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.386
I'm Mrs. Jarvis. Won't you come in?

15:14.847 --> 15:17.828
Between here and the office,

15:17.883 --> 15:20.864
the art alone should bring
between four and five million.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.990
That ought to cover it.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.624
It's not enough. It's not enough.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.294
We're leveraged way beyond that.

15:27.459 --> 15:29.803
Sorry, sorry, I know you're
in the middle of something,

15:29.862 --> 15:31.432
but there are two
police detectives here.

15:31.497 --> 15:32.999
They want to talk to you.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.934
They didn't say what it was about.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.577
Is everything all right?

15:37.736 --> 15:38.771
Everything's fine.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.147
You want me to stay?

15:44.209 --> 15:47.156
No, honey, I'm sure I can
handle whatever it is they need.

15:47.212 --> 15:49.556
Actually, it would be
better if she did stay.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.219
Um, Arthur Jarvis?

15:51.283 --> 15:52.353
Yes.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.064
We'd like to talk with you
and your wife in private.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.958
Whatever you have to say can
be said in front of Spencer.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.661
He's a part of our family.

15:59.992 --> 16:01.062
Spencer Harrison?

16:01.660 --> 16:02.730
Yes.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.342
Miss Jarvis,
we regret to inform you

16:06.398 --> 16:08.935
that Mavis Kerfield was
murdered last night.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.107
What?

16:12.471 --> 16:13.848
Oh, my God.

16:13.906 --> 16:14.941
I don't believe it.

16:15.007 --> 16:16.611
Her body was discovered
this morning.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.320
Are you certain she was murdered?

16:18.377 --> 16:19.515
It was a homicide, yes.

16:19.578 --> 16:22.058
And we'd like to ask you
all a few questions.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.984
You think we might have had
something to do with it?

16:25.050 --> 16:26.688
We're just beginning
the investigation.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.425
Now, we understand that
you and Mr. Harrison

16:28.487 --> 16:30.967
met with the victim yesterday
about financial concerns.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.599
Financial concerns?
What are they talking...

16:33.659 --> 16:35.900
That conversation was confidential.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.599
We'd like you all to come
down to the precinct.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.574
This is simply outrageous.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.137
Who told you?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.338
Sir, please calm down.

16:42.401 --> 16:43.744
I don't understand
what's happening.

16:44.536 --> 16:45.981
It's fine. It'll be fine.

16:49.575 --> 16:50.986
Could you give us a few minutes?

16:52.678 --> 16:53.782
We'll wait outside.

16:59.618 --> 17:00.619
Yeah, Burkhardt.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.428
This is Detective Gubser with
the Rhinebeck Police Department.

17:03.489 --> 17:05.469
Am I speaking with Nick Burkhardt?

17:05.656 --> 17:08.035
Uh, yeah. Juliette said
you might be calling.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.595
Do you have anything for me?

17:09.661 --> 17:11.106
Yeah. A year after the accident,

17:11.163 --> 17:13.268
the case was reclassified
as a homicide.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.710
It's one of the more frustrating
cases lever worked on.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.544
We identified four suspects
we believe were responsible

17:18.604 --> 17:20.446
for the deaths of Kelly
and Reed Burkhardt,

17:21.140 --> 17:22.813
who I believe were your parents?

17:24.175 --> 17:26.554
Yeah. I'm sorry.
You said four suspects?

17:26.878 --> 17:28.415
Uh, yeah. Uh...

17:31.417 --> 17:32.828
Soledad Marquesa,

17:33.886 --> 17:34.921
Hans Roth,

17:35.421 --> 17:36.559
Ian Flynn,

17:37.689 --> 17:39.600
and Akira Kimura.

17:41.927 --> 17:44.601
I didn't get that last name,
could you repeat it?

17:44.663 --> 17:46.506
Yeah. Akira Kimura.

17:47.833 --> 17:51.076
I puffed up the most recent
photos we've got on these guys.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.308
Three of them are mug shots.

17:52.371 --> 17:54.544
One of them was a surveillance
photo from Interpol.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.483
Do you want me to
send you what we got?

17:57.276 --> 17:58.380
Yeah.

18:02.781 --> 18:05.819
I didn't expect her to
just give me the money.

18:05.884 --> 18:08.728
I told her I just needed some
time to figure things out.

18:08.787 --> 18:12.360
I only went to her because
there was no other place to go.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.766
What'd you do after the meeting?

18:15.828 --> 18:17.603
I went home and I stayed home.

18:17.663 --> 18:19.609
You didn't tell your wife? No.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.509
I didn't want to worry her.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.278
We only got married a year ago.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.373
We just moved into
that house last July.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.384
Everything's been going so well...

18:29.274 --> 18:30.378
Until this.

18:31.143 --> 18:32.383
What kind of
relationship did you have

18:32.444 --> 18:35.015
with Mrs. Kerfield and her
daughters Tiffany and Taylor?

18:35.214 --> 18:36.921
The relationship was strained.

18:37.683 --> 18:40.789
I met Tiffany and Taylor
through a mutual friend.

18:40.853 --> 18:44.027
It was supposed to be sort
of a set up between us.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.760
There was a party at the house,
a big black tie fundraiser.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.430
Anyways, I went.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.604
And I danced with both
Tiffany and Taylor,

18:52.664 --> 18:54.371
and then I met Lucinda.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.605
After I danced with her,

18:57.269 --> 18:58.646
well, you saw her.

18:59.238 --> 19:01.582
I don't know if you believe
in love at first sight,

19:02.241 --> 19:03.447
but that was it for me.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.187
So we've got some sister
rivalry going on here?

19:06.678 --> 19:08.214
Long before I came on the scene.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.385
But I think my marriage to Lucinda

19:10.449 --> 19:12.326
was the straw that
broke the camel's back.

19:13.051 --> 19:14.689
Did you have any kind of

19:14.820 --> 19:16.822
sexual relationship with
either of the sisters

19:16.889 --> 19:18.300
before you met Lucinda?

19:19.691 --> 19:20.726
No.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.302
Look, it's atypical
family situation.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.405
Lucinda is beautiful.

19:26.632 --> 19:29.408
The other sisters, not so much.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.004
It's a girl thing.
There's jealousy.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.782
And Lucinda's always
been the outsider.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.910
Her mother died when
she was nine years old.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.816
And then her father married
Mavis when she was 11

19:39.878 --> 19:41.755
and then he died
seven months later.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.926
I can't believe anyone
would do this to her.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.325
Tiffany and Taylor
must be devastated.

19:51.089 --> 19:54.901
Poor Tiffany, what she must be going
through after finding her body.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.803
You didn't always get
along with your sisters

19:57.196 --> 19:58.607
or your stepmother, did you?

19:59.598 --> 20:00.906
Of course not.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.536
But if you think
that's unusual, I...

20:02.601 --> 20:04.842
We just want to find out what
your relationship was like.

20:08.006 --> 20:10.350
It was difficult sometimes.

20:11.443 --> 20:12.786
I mean, my dad died.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.483
I was pretty young.
It hit me very hard.

20:16.114 --> 20:19.254
I guess I closed off from
everyone for a little while.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.161
I spent a lot of time by myself,

20:21.453 --> 20:23.296
blaming my dad for dying

20:24.623 --> 20:28.196
and leaving me with people
I didn't know that well.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.071
What do you expect?
I was just a kid.

20:32.130 --> 20:33.438
Do you know if there was a will?

20:34.967 --> 20:36.708
I'm sure there was,

20:37.369 --> 20:39.246
but, you know,
I'm not exactly in the loop.

20:39.471 --> 20:41.974
Did you know your father's estate
was left to your stepsisters?

20:43.308 --> 20:44.343
No.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.221
That doesn't surprise me.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.391
I was never Mavis's daughter.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.683
I was always her stepdaughter.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.729
I suppose that made
you pretty upset.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.460
Well, I guess it should have,

20:56.822 --> 20:59.894
but no, I consider
myself very lucky.

21:00.525 --> 21:03.734
I met Arthur, and he's a
wonderful man. I fell in love.

21:04.796 --> 21:05.797
I'm not unhappy.

21:05.864 --> 21:08.276
I would never do anything to
jeopardize my life with him.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.244
What about Spencer?
How long have you known him?

21:10.302 --> 21:11.542
Forever.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.015
He's my godfather.
He was my father's best friend.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.280
He's always been there for me.

21:16.475 --> 21:20.013
He was the only real family
I had after my father died.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.018
Lucinda's father and
I grew up together.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.893
We made and lost a
couple of fortunes.

21:28.253 --> 21:30.164
He kept his last one. I didn't.

21:30.355 --> 21:33.666
He was kind enough to bring
me aboard and I never left.

21:34.192 --> 21:35.466
When he got sick,

21:35.527 --> 21:38.736
I promised him that I would
always look after Lucinda.

21:38.897 --> 21:40.103
I made avow to him.

21:40.165 --> 21:42.236
Why didn't you set up a
trust fund for Lucinda?

21:42.301 --> 21:47.478
Well, Henry was never a
really good judge of women.

21:48.607 --> 21:52.555
He always trusted them to do the
right thing and they never did.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.183
What time did you and Arthur get
back from your meeting with Mavis?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.659
We returned home by about 7:00.

21:58.717 --> 21:59.957
And what did you do then?

22:00.018 --> 22:01.964
We tried to figure out a way
out of this Aidikoff mess.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.499
And what time did you leave?

22:03.555 --> 22:06.161
I didn't. I stayed
in the guest room

22:06.591 --> 22:09.071
Arthur and I,
we had a lot to discuss.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.833
There's no physical evidence

22:10.896 --> 22:13.672
to place any of them at the crime
scene at the time of the murder.

22:13.732 --> 22:15.712
Do we have any explanation
for the shattered glass?

22:15.767 --> 22:17.542
Techs are still trying
to figure that one out.

22:17.636 --> 22:20.845
Best explanation they've come up
with so far is a giant microwave.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.648
Or a jet flew through the living room,
breaking the sound barrier.

22:23.709 --> 22:27.213
All that busted glass,
bleeding eardrums, blown out eyeballs,

22:27.279 --> 22:30.021
if I didn't know better,
I'd say someone set off a bomb.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.221
Right, so there's no
rational explanation.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.388
Not yet.

22:33.452 --> 22:34.590
Who's winning the lottery on this?

22:34.653 --> 22:35.996
That would be the stepsisters.

22:36.054 --> 22:38.364
Lucinda was cut out of the
will when her father died.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.662
Do we know why?

22:39.725 --> 22:40.795
Bottom line,

22:41.126 --> 22:42.935
stepmom likes her daughters best.

22:42.994 --> 22:44.598
And what do we think
about the sisters?

22:44.663 --> 22:45.869
They're still on the list.

22:45.931 --> 22:47.035
Checking alibis.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.343
Well, this family's
politically connected.

22:49.401 --> 22:51.779
The sisters have enough money
to get the best representation

22:51.837 --> 22:54.408
and the DA will not prosecute
without hard evidence.

22:54.473 --> 22:56.043
So when you make a move,

22:56.108 --> 22:57.849
make sure it's the right one.

23:02.247 --> 23:03.624
Anything important?

23:07.018 --> 23:08.429
It could be.

23:16.695 --> 23:19.835
Those are the guys that were involved
in the jewelry store robbery.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.571
Yeah.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.379
Yeah, I got this from a
detective in Rhinebeck

23:24.436 --> 23:26.313
who was investigating the
murder of my parents.

23:26.938 --> 23:28.110
They were involved?

23:28.407 --> 23:29.579
Seems like.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.414
Well, that would be weird.

23:34.045 --> 23:35.547
At least they're all dead.

23:37.115 --> 23:38.150
Except one.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.528
There was a fourth man.

23:50.529 --> 23:51.803
The money doesn't matter.

23:51.863 --> 23:54.673
The property,
none of that stuff matters.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.005
The only thing that's ever
mattered is you and me.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.049
From the first moment I saw you,

24:00.105 --> 24:02.642
I forgot about everything else.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.378
I don't know.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.354
We'll move,
we can leave this place.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.618
We'll start over.

24:09.681 --> 24:13.128
All I know is I just want us to be
together for the rest of our lives

24:13.185 --> 24:15.665
and I know in my heart
that you want that too.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.628
You just have to let it go.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.964
Do you really think I
care about the money?

24:23.261 --> 24:24.968
I don't care about any of that.

24:25.096 --> 24:26.700
I really don't.

24:27.265 --> 24:29.438
But I have to go over there.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.777
This is my life. I need closure.

24:31.837 --> 24:34.044
It's too dangerous.
Don't do this to me.

24:36.274 --> 24:37.514
I just love you so much.

24:37.576 --> 24:40.523
I love you too, Arthur,
but this is family.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.622
They don't like you!

24:42.681 --> 24:44.183
They never have.

24:45.684 --> 24:48.130
If one of them could
kill their own mother,

24:48.186 --> 24:51.167
what's going to stop
them from killing you?

24:56.495 --> 24:58.202
We're not giving them a dime.

24:58.263 --> 24:59.742
We should give them something.

25:00.098 --> 25:01.907
If we do, where would it stop?

25:02.234 --> 25:04.510
You saw what happened to Mom.

25:05.937 --> 25:07.348
They did that to get to us.

25:07.405 --> 25:09.578
They think we're going to cave,
but we're not.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.383
Taylor, we have to be strong.

25:13.612 --> 25:15.387
I'm not like you.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.225
Get a hold of yourself

25:17.616 --> 25:19.618
and put the vodka
back in the freezer.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.272
Arthur, what's wrong?

25:40.438 --> 25:42.679
I woke up this
morning she was gone.

25:42.741 --> 25:44.118
She's gone? Where did she go?

25:44.175 --> 25:45.279
I don't know.

25:45.343 --> 25:46.413
Did she go see Tiffany?

25:46.478 --> 25:49.322
We argued last night.
She said she wanted to talk to her.

25:49.648 --> 25:52.026
It was something she had to do.

25:53.585 --> 25:55.030
You were supposed to protect her.

25:55.253 --> 25:57.199
I've never been able
to say no to her.

25:57.355 --> 25:58.732
That's the problem, isn't it?

25:59.157 --> 26:02.627
When you married her, she was supposed
to become your responsibility.

26:02.694 --> 26:05.641
You don't protect her by
letting her run off alone.

26:14.339 --> 26:16.876
What are you doing?

26:16.942 --> 26:17.977
You scared the hell out of me.

26:18.043 --> 26:20.045
I didn't mean to scare you.
ls Taylor here?

26:20.345 --> 26:21.517
What do you want?

26:21.980 --> 26:24.085
I just came to tell
you how sorry I am.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.887
That Mom died.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.327
You don't mean that.

26:28.386 --> 26:29.865
You never even liked Mom.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.626
No, she didn't like me.

26:32.891 --> 26:35.667
Excuse me, you were the
one that was the terror.

26:36.628 --> 26:38.301
I was alone in this house.

26:38.363 --> 26:41.207
Anything I did was for
self-preservation.

26:41.466 --> 26:43.742
You never even wanted me
as part of your family.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.281
Not with the way you acted,

26:45.637 --> 26:47.514
always entitled to everything.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.779
The little princess.
Oh, my God, here it comes.

26:49.841 --> 26:51.912
Thank you for stopping by, Lucinda.

26:52.077 --> 26:54.250
It was very nice. I have to go.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.618
Tiffany, please.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.388
Spencer and Arthur cannot
force us to give you anything.

26:58.683 --> 27:01.061
I don't know how they did
what they did to Mom,

27:01.119 --> 27:02.359
but I know they did it.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.065
Get out of my way.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.109
Tiff, I just want you
to listen to one thing.

27:25.176 --> 27:27.452
Hey, Nick, I think
I've got something.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.388
Well, good, because I got nothing.

27:30.448 --> 27:32.428
Did he look like this? Yes.

27:33.218 --> 27:34.561
Murciélago.

27:34.619 --> 27:37.293
Well, at least according
to your Spanish forbearer,

27:37.355 --> 27:39.858
Jose Maria Lopez Diego y Grimm,

27:40.191 --> 27:42.171
who caught up with one
in the upper Amazon.

27:42.227 --> 27:44.173
My people know them
as Geölterblitz,

27:44.229 --> 27:45.936
literally bat out of hell.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.436
It's a legendary liminal being.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.374
And that means what?

27:50.435 --> 27:52.676
Well, it's two distinct
states of existence

27:52.737 --> 27:55.013
simultaneous within
one physical body.

27:55.206 --> 27:56.708
The duality of humanity,

27:56.775 --> 27:58.083
the yin and the yang,

27:58.143 --> 28:00.714
the Ike and Tina Turner of it all.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.724
Anyway. According to these notes,

28:04.149 --> 28:06.254
they make a very high pitched sound

28:06.351 --> 28:09.230
that can peel the bark off a dog.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.858
At the murder site, there were
broken light bulbs and mirrors,

28:12.924 --> 28:14.733
could that be a Murciélago?

28:14.793 --> 28:15.863
Or a geo-whatever?

28:15.927 --> 28:18.464
Well, if I'm reading these
illustrations correctly,

28:18.530 --> 28:21.033
its sound can shatter eardrums,

28:21.166 --> 28:24.010
pop eyeballs,
rupture nasal passages,

28:24.669 --> 28:26.114
blow out bowels.

28:27.472 --> 28:29.509
And generally wreak havoc
with whatever's left.

28:29.574 --> 28:31.178
How am I going to
face off against one?

28:31.509 --> 28:33.955
With one of these, if you got one.

28:38.149 --> 28:40.527
Murciélago Matraca.

28:41.653 --> 28:44.463
Looks like some kind
of hand-crank siren.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.062
Apparently,

28:47.792 --> 28:51.638
yeah, it wreaks havoc with
their ultrasonic sound waves,

28:51.696 --> 28:55.508
negating their ability to,
you know, blow out your eyes.

28:56.634 --> 28:59.376
You ever seen anything
like that before?

28:59.771 --> 29:01.648
Actually, I think I have.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.446
You're kidding me.

29:11.816 --> 29:14.729
God, there is some amazing
stuff in this trailer.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.257
Do you have this place insured?

29:17.522 --> 29:20.002
Well, that would mean having
to admit that it existed, so...

29:20.125 --> 29:21.661
Oh, yeah, there's that.

29:22.861 --> 29:25.637
Oh, man, we got to try this out.

29:26.164 --> 29:28.269
Look at this craftsmanship.

29:29.567 --> 29:32.241
I mean, this is one
solid piece of work.

29:32.303 --> 29:33.475
There you go.

29:33.538 --> 29:35.848
All right, you know
this is the handle.

29:36.007 --> 29:40.046
I think you just crank her up,
get her up to speed.

29:40.145 --> 29:42.523
I think this is the silencer.

29:43.414 --> 29:44.552
You want to do it?

29:44.682 --> 29:45.820
Oh, man, so bad.

29:45.884 --> 29:47.363
Be my guest.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.669
Ooh.

30:04.235 --> 30:05.646
I don't hear it anymore.

30:05.703 --> 30:07.842
I do. It's pretty intense.

30:08.239 --> 30:09.684
It's a little
uncomfortable actually.

30:09.741 --> 30:12.244
I mean, I think if this thing
were pointed in my direction...

30:15.413 --> 30:16.619
Oops.

30:19.684 --> 30:21.755
Looks like you're good to go.

30:26.491 --> 30:27.936
Are you here to arrest me?

30:27.992 --> 30:29.096
Where's Spencer?

30:29.327 --> 30:30.499
I don't know.

30:30.962 --> 30:33.568
It would be very easy for
me to put out an APB on him,

30:33.665 --> 30:35.201
and I don't want to do that yet.

30:36.801 --> 30:38.678
You think he killed
Lucinda's stepmother?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.145
When was the last time you saw him?

30:40.305 --> 30:42.285
Uh, this morning,
but I don't know where he is now.

30:43.107 --> 30:44.245
Okay, where's your wife?

30:44.442 --> 30:46.080
I'm right here.

30:47.212 --> 30:48.486
What's the problem?

30:49.247 --> 30:50.658
We need to find Spencer.

30:50.815 --> 30:52.761
Do you know where he is?

30:52.817 --> 30:54.990
He thinks Spencer
killed your stepmom.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.861
No, that's impossible.
You're wrong. He couldn't have.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.894
Lucinda, you need to
stop protecting him.

31:02.493 --> 31:04.336
Spencer was furious
I tried to stop him.

31:04.395 --> 31:06.875
He's the one that made me go to Mavis
in the first place about the money.

31:06.931 --> 31:08.103
I didn't want to go.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.008
I think he went back to the
house to talk to Tiffany,

31:10.101 --> 31:11.876
but that's all I know.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.578
Hank, listen, it's me.

31:14.639 --> 31:18.587
I need you and a couple units
to get to 435 Woodbury Drive.

31:19.177 --> 31:21.817
Yeah, I think Spencer's on his way
there to kill one of the sisters.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.617
Okay. Bye.

31:53.311 --> 31:55.154
Oh, my God.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.888
Lucinda, what have you done?

32:04.622 --> 32:06.693
Damn it, Tiffany, where are you?

32:06.891 --> 32:10.031
Pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.086
I had nothing to do with this.

32:28.146 --> 32:29.420
Turn around.

32:29.847 --> 32:31.724
Hands above your head. Turn around!

32:34.319 --> 32:36.663
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:38.089 --> 32:40.899
Open your mouth and I
blow your head off.

32:41.225 --> 32:43.034
I know how you kill.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.016
We got a crime scene here.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.781
Lock off the area around the BMW.

32:57.842 --> 32:59.515
We got a dead vic inside. You okay?

32:59.577 --> 33:00.681
Yeah.

33:01.045 --> 33:02.319
Oh, man, not again.

33:02.413 --> 33:03.619
Afraid so.

33:03.681 --> 33:05.183
Same MO?

33:05.249 --> 33:06.922
Looks like. You don't understand.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.191
Put him in the car.

33:09.620 --> 33:10.826
Let's go.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.200
No jet plane, no microwave,
how did he do this?

33:17.261 --> 33:18.968
I don't know yet.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.835
Tiffany Kerfield was killed in
the same manner as her mother.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.311
Anybody want to explain it?

33:24.369 --> 33:26.747
We can't. He had
no weapon with him.

33:26.804 --> 33:28.511
Then how do we connect
him to the murders?

33:28.573 --> 33:30.746
We're hoping CSU can
connect him with DNA.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.412
I read the report
from the first scene,

33:32.477 --> 33:35.185
so far there's nothing definitive
to connect anybody to that crime.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.518
Sorry to disturb,
but your suspect wants to confess.

33:39.617 --> 33:40.857
I thought you might want to know.

33:41.452 --> 33:42.692
There's our link.

33:43.287 --> 33:44.459
Let's get that confession.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.573
I don't see the need
to play any games.

33:55.466 --> 33:56.740
I know what you are,

33:56.801 --> 33:59.247
and I guess you
both know what I am.

34:04.509 --> 34:07.388
So, it's time to state the obvious.

34:08.612 --> 34:11.650
I killed both Mavis
and Tiffany Kerfield.

34:12.717 --> 34:13.889
Why?

34:14.619 --> 34:17.565
I've been involved in Lucinda's
life since the day she was born.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.659
I witnessed firsthand
how she was treated

34:19.724 --> 34:21.795
by her stepmother and stepsisters.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.667
And when they turned down
her request for help,

34:26.330 --> 34:27.934
it was more than I could bear.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.103
I understand you were mad.

34:31.168 --> 34:32.375
I get that.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.715
How'd you kill them?

34:36.040 --> 34:37.849
Well, as you know,

34:38.409 --> 34:41.447
I have the ability
to project a sound

34:41.512 --> 34:44.925
so powerful it can shatter
glass and burst eardrums.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.862
At its most optimum frequency,

34:47.985 --> 34:51.398
this ability can cause the arteries
in the human bodies to explode,

34:51.456 --> 34:52.833
hence the explanation
for the eyeballs.

34:52.889 --> 34:54.927
Now, look, shouldn't I be,
like, signing something

34:54.992 --> 34:56.994
and writing this all down?

35:05.069 --> 35:06.742
Okay. All right.

35:07.705 --> 35:10.982
You think you're going to get out
of this by playing the crazy card.

35:11.042 --> 35:12.953
But that don't work with me.

35:21.319 --> 35:22.889
Very clever.

35:25.189 --> 35:27.726
Telling the truth. Now what?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.237
I needed to talk to you alone.

35:29.293 --> 35:31.739
Now, I did not kill either of them.

35:32.096 --> 35:34.576
Though I am responsible
for their deaths.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.581
I failed her father as
much as I failed her.

35:39.036 --> 35:41.016
Man, I kept watch on
her all those years

35:41.072 --> 35:43.643
and made sure that she
never lost control.

35:43.841 --> 35:46.845
As long as she got everything
she wanted, it worked,

35:47.578 --> 35:49.114
but she has no conscience.

35:49.580 --> 35:50.854
She's uncontrollable

35:50.915 --> 35:53.122
and she made those
people's lives miserable.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.763
So you're telling
me Lucinda did this?

35:55.820 --> 35:59.233
I'm saying that Taylor does
not have much longer to live.

35:59.690 --> 36:03.137
And once she dies,
Lucinda inherits everything,

36:03.194 --> 36:06.198
and you'll never be able to prove
that she had anything to do with it.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.517
I need you to meet me
there as soon as you can.

36:21.579 --> 36:25.618
But first, I need you to go to that
trailer and pick up the Matraca.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.190
Are you good with that? Yeah.
Yeah. I got it.

36:28.252 --> 36:29.925
All right, great.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.929
Thank you. I appreciate that.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.636
I don't think Spencer did it.

36:37.128 --> 36:39.005
No kidding. He's a nutcase.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.476
I just heard back from
the estate lawyer.

36:41.532 --> 36:44.843
Once the mother dies,
the $52 million goes to the sisters.

36:44.902 --> 36:47.007
And once they're dead,
Lucinda inherits everything.

36:47.071 --> 36:48.277
Will or no will.

36:48.339 --> 36:50.012
She'll be going after
the last sister.

36:50.074 --> 36:51.678
Better check her out.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.189
What the hell is that?

37:05.790 --> 37:06.996
That came from interrogation.

37:12.430 --> 37:13.738
No way.

37:15.266 --> 37:16.643
No way.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.112
Let's go.

37:27.712 --> 37:29.419
What happened?

37:29.480 --> 37:30.823
I did what you said.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.357
I stood up to her.

37:35.886 --> 37:37.263
She went to Taylor's.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.494
I swear I tried to stop her.

37:39.824 --> 37:40.996
She said...

37:42.159 --> 37:44.264
She said she never loved me.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.480
Hello?

37:57.608 --> 37:59.610
Taylor Kerfield? Yes. Speaking.

37:59.677 --> 38:01.418
This is Detective Burkhardt.
We have reason to believe

38:01.479 --> 38:03.390
your life could be in danger.
Oh, my God.

38:03.648 --> 38:05.025
Are you at home? Yes.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.424
All right. Stay there.
We're on our way.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.088
Lock the doors.
Do not open them for anyone

38:08.152 --> 38:09.392
until we get there,
do you understand?

38:09.453 --> 38:11.194
Yes. Yes. I'm doing it now.

38:17.828 --> 38:19.000
Hi, sis.

38:24.268 --> 38:25.440
Get away from me.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.213
Are we going to play chase?

38:27.271 --> 38:29.217
Just like when we were kids?

38:30.241 --> 38:31.743
You know I always caught you.

38:39.350 --> 38:40.385
She's in the house!

38:45.523 --> 38:47.696
Now you're going to look just
like your mother and sister.

38:48.392 --> 38:50.394
One big happy dead family.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.044
Lucinda, stop!

38:58.803 --> 39:00.510
Watch out for Spencer!
He could be here!

39:00.571 --> 39:01.811
Got it.

39:14.452 --> 39:17.023
I got it! I got the device.
Am I too late?

39:17.655 --> 39:19.657
Oh, no, I can't be too late,
you're still alive.

39:19.724 --> 39:21.135
That's a good thing.
She's in the garage.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.035
No, no, no, dude,
you can't go in there, man.

39:23.260 --> 39:25.137
If you can't see her,
you can't shoot her.

39:25.796 --> 39:28.436
You got to... You know, she'll,
like, blow your head up.

39:28.499 --> 39:29.739
You got to force her out.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.973
Yeah. Come on.
Let's set this up. Here.

40:22.019 --> 40:24.021
Spencer, you have to help me.

40:24.388 --> 40:27.301
I know. I should have
helped you a long time ago.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.762
Stop.

40:33.531 --> 40:35.204
Ah, God.

40:40.871 --> 40:42.942
Hey, wait up. Slow down!

40:48.546 --> 40:49.684
It stopped.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.991
Wait Maybe I should set
this thing up again.

40:52.049 --> 40:53.619
No, it could be a trap.

40:54.985 --> 40:56.055
I'm sorry.

40:58.422 --> 40:59.958
I did the best I could.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.337
Goodbye.

41:11.735 --> 41:14.306
You did hear what I said
about it being a trap, right?

41:27.151 --> 41:28.494
Oh, man.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.031
So how you going to
explain this one?

41:41.232 --> 41:43.007
So this is what she used?

41:43.067 --> 41:44.239
Apparently.

41:44.869 --> 41:46.280
Yeah, they found it
at the crime scene.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.682
It makes a really high-pitched
sound that shatters glass.

41:51.642 --> 41:52.985
Among other things.

41:53.477 --> 41:54.615
Oh.

41:57.448 --> 41:59.985
Anybody want to show
me how it works?

42:05.556 --> 42:07.001
Hey, I'm really sorry

42:07.157 --> 42:09.137
about all this. I...

42:09.260 --> 42:11.262
I thought I could help bring
you some closure or something

42:11.328 --> 42:13.501
and all I did was
open an old wound.

42:13.764 --> 42:14.936
No, it's okay.

42:16.133 --> 42:18.113
This is something I needed to know.

42:23.173 --> 42:25.380
And something I'm going
to have to deal with.
