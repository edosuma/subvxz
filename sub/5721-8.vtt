WEBVTT

00:36.340 --> 00:38.854
But we can also always keep
track of what you need--

00:38.900 --> 00:40.208
a heart or a liver.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.854
WOMAN:
You can extract them intact?

00:41.910 --> 00:44.333
Yes. We know where not to grab.

00:44.390 --> 00:46.950
Then we don't squash the part
of the specimen you need.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.127
WOMAN:
And you can change its position?

00:49.170 --> 00:52.788
If we need to.
Again, ultrasound helps.

00:52.830 --> 00:56.436
With the added dilation,
we can change it to a breach.

00:58.790 --> 01:00.746
So you have to tell me
what you're thinking.

01:00.790 --> 01:03.406
I can't guess.I think you can.

01:03.450 --> 01:06.010
Well, you're against abortion,
so my guess is you're repul...

01:06.060 --> 01:07.539
I'm a human being.
And yes, I am appalled

01:07.580 --> 01:08.888
by a doctor calmly eating yogurt

01:08.930 --> 01:10.750
while talking about selling...

01:10.800 --> 01:12.449
No, not selling.$100 a specimen.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.058
To preserve,
package and deliver.

01:14.110 --> 01:15.668
That is legal.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.278
Oh, God, do you hear yourself?
Parts of babies.

01:17.330 --> 01:19.673
Preserving, packaging
and delivering parts of babies.

01:19.730 --> 01:21.686
Parts of fetuses.

01:21.730 --> 01:23.118
So you think there's anything
wrong with that video?

01:23.170 --> 01:25.855
I think it's shop talk.

01:25.910 --> 01:28.470
I think if you listen
to any two doctors...

01:28.520 --> 01:29.646
Or abortionists....talking

01:29.690 --> 01:31.908
over drinks or yogurt

01:31.960 --> 01:35.737
about an appendix removal,
it would sound just as bad.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.690
So you know it's bad?No, I know
it's an effective

01:37.740 --> 01:39.139
piece of propaganda.
That's all.

01:39.180 --> 01:40.568
And why is it
so effective?

01:40.620 --> 01:42.440
Because the majority
of Americans

01:42.490 --> 01:45.266
only support abortion if they
don't have to face the fact

01:45.320 --> 01:46.969
of it, if they don't
have to hear the talk

01:47.010 --> 01:48.887
about where to squash...The majority

01:48.930 --> 01:50.830
of Americans
only support anything

01:50.890 --> 01:52.926
if they don't have to face
the fact of it.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.936
How the hamburger
ended up on their plate.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.754
Except this has a face.

01:56.810 --> 01:58.459
It's not an appendix.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.286
It's a human being.

02:00.330 --> 02:02.935
Well, that's the difference
between us.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.332
I don't believe it.

02:04.380 --> 02:07.076
How did you even get it?The video?

02:07.120 --> 02:09.202
Citizens for Ethical Medicine.Oh, God.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.592
_ That _radical
anti-abortion group?

02:10.650 --> 02:12.777
It's not radical.
Why is something

02:12.820 --> 02:15.163
radical merely because
you disagree with it?What, they pretended to be

02:15.220 --> 02:17.996
a bioengineering firm
needing human tissue?

02:18.050 --> 02:20.610
Aborted fetal organs.And, what-- you're-you're
planning to do what with that?

02:20.660 --> 02:21.911
Sue.Who?

02:21.960 --> 02:23.780
Her. Her organization.For what?

02:23.830 --> 02:25.786
Well, that's where you come in.No.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.968
It's not about you
being a lavwer.Oh, really?

02:29.010 --> 02:31.888
Thank you.It's about you telling me
how Mr. Dipple can sue.

02:31.930 --> 02:32.885
Well, he can grow a uterus.

02:32.930 --> 02:34.704
You don't have standing.

02:34.760 --> 02:35.795
What are you gonna sue for?

02:35.850 --> 02:36.976
Selling of fetuses.No.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.806
What, $100? That's nothing.

02:38.850 --> 02:42.672
The repositioning of fetuses
for a breech birth?

02:44.250 --> 02:46.115
That's it.No.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.855
Right?

02:47.900 --> 02:50.209
You need a woman
who had an abortion there,

02:50.250 --> 02:52.901
_ a woman who was
lied to about the procedures,

02:52.950 --> 02:55.510
and a woman who suffered
measurable harm as a result.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.551
Those are the
three criteria?Yes.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.901
You have someone?

03:00.960 --> 03:03.042
You tell me.

03:03.090 --> 03:04.955
Stacy Groom.
27 years old.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.398
Had an abortion,
regretted it.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.000
She fulfills all
three criteria.

03:09.050 --> 03:11.006
I'm not asking you
to take her case.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.051
I won't take her case.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.579
I'm asking you to
cross-examine her.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.180
Do your worst. See if
she's ready for court.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.715
Mr. Crouse. Can you start today?

03:27.770 --> 03:29.021
Sure. What do you need?

03:29.070 --> 03:32.415
Information
on thIs woman.

03:32.470 --> 03:34.426
She regrets
an abortion

03:34.470 --> 03:36.643
and is suing
the abortion clinic.

03:36.690 --> 03:38.942
What's the cap
on hours?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.558
Cap?

03:40.610 --> 03:43.170
Whenever the work
is done, it's done.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.211
I'm on my way.

03:48.310 --> 03:49.868
[door closes]

03:49.920 --> 03:51.399
The_bills are
piling up

03:51.440 --> 03:53.089
and we do not
have enough revenue

03:53.140 --> 03:55.836
coming in
to pay our bills,

03:55.880 --> 03:57.222
so we need to
compensate.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.965
We can't keep living DUI to DUI.

04:00.020 --> 04:01.976
I'm open to suggestions.Well, for
one thing,

04:02.020 --> 04:03.533
we need _to ration.
We're spending too much

04:03.590 --> 04:05.239
on investigator hours.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.145
Should I leave?No.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.100
Look, we still
need to be effective.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.151
We can't ration our way
to success.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.725
Then what?We cancel
our Westlaw subscription

04:13.770 --> 04:16.284
and we do_uble our_efforts
to bring in new clients.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.729
We eat what we kill.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.293
What does that mean?

04:20.340 --> 04:22.160
It means that Lucca and I
both get two-thirds

04:22.210 --> 04:24.952
of whatever business
we bring in. No more 50-50.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.558
LUCCA:
It'll make us
hungrier, work harder.

04:26.610 --> 04:29.124
If you want it, I want it.I want it.

04:29.180 --> 04:30.784
Where you going?

04:30.830 --> 04:32.218
Business lunch.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.915
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.961
What do you need?

04:42.490 --> 04:44.139
I'm a fan.

04:44.190 --> 04:45.669
Uh, here,
have some wine.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.494
I... I-I'd pour it, but it'd...

04:47.540 --> 04:48.973
[chuckles]
...get all over the place.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.362
How exactly are you a fan?

04:50.420 --> 04:51.899
The T-Port case.

04:51.940 --> 04:53.544
You're scrappy,
you're aggressive.

04:53.590 --> 04:55.023
You deserve better.

04:55.070 --> 04:57.118
What's better?$90,000 a year.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.151
Another 30
guaranteed as bonus.

04:59.210 --> 05:01.019
Plus ten percent of
whatever business you bring in.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.206
No, thanks.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.161
You're four years out of
law school,

05:04.210 --> 05:06.337
Lucca. You don't have that
much room to negotiate.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.607
Oh, I'm not
negoﬁaﬂng.

05:07.650 --> 05:11.086
I just don't want to be bait.

05:11.130 --> 05:13.041
You're trying to lure Alicia,

05:13.090 --> 05:15.001
right?
So, either

05:15.050 --> 05:16.699
make it clear why you want me

05:16.750 --> 05:18.741
or save your money.

05:20.270 --> 05:22.352
Hey, Mom?

05:22.400 --> 05:24.095
I want to help.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.664
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

05:25.710 --> 05:28.440
No, mom, let me help.
What can I do?

05:28.500 --> 05:31.321
Okay.

05:31.370 --> 05:32.928
Cold call.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.322
Go through the phone book.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.928
Call businesses,
one after another.

05:35.980 --> 05:38.028
See if they need
legal representation.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.196
Where would I start?

05:39.250 --> 05:41.059
_ Mid-level
insurance firms.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.463
And maybe real estate.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.240
How do I know it's mid-level?Look at the size
of the ad, see how big it is.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.905
Okay. And do I get a percentage
ifI find anyone?

05:48.950 --> 05:51.077
I thought this was to help.

05:51.130 --> 05:53.348
It is.
But do I get a percentage?

05:53.390 --> 05:55.733
[laughs]

05:55.790 --> 05:58.042
Okay. I will give you

05:58.090 --> 06:00.217
half a percentage point
for any booking.

06:00.270 --> 06:02.261
One percentage point would be
even more of an incentive.

06:02.310 --> 06:04.961
You're right.

06:05.010 --> 06:06.443
But what I'm offering

06:06.490 --> 06:08.833
is half a percentage point.

06:08.890 --> 06:12.530
Stacy Groom. I work as a copy
editor at Myrtle Publishing.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.105
Did the 8th Street clinic
perform an abortion on you?

06:15.150 --> 06:16.492
They did.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.233
Ten months ago.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.372
And did Dr. Hallie Fisher
perform that abortion?

06:20.420 --> 06:22.411
The woman on
the video?Yes.

06:22.460 --> 06:25.816
Did she accurately
represent the procedure to you?No.

06:25.860 --> 06:28.203
_ She t_ricked me_
into donating fetal tissue.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.945
She never told me
it would be sold.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.254
She even...

06:32.300 --> 06:35.383
flipped the baby
into a breech position to help

06:35.430 --> 06:37.955
better harvest the organs.And what,
if any,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.265
damages did you suffer
as a result?

06:41.310 --> 06:43.266
Well, I, um...

06:43.310 --> 06:44.527
I cry all the time now.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.390
I can't eat.
I can barely sleep.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.749
Wsum

06:48.790 --> 06:50.610
hard to get to work
every day.

06:50.670 --> 06:53.184
My work
has suffered.

06:53.230 --> 06:54.959
Are we boring you, Diane?

06:55.020 --> 06:56.442
No, quite scintillating.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.195
[door opens]

06:58.240 --> 07:00.231
Anything?You tell me.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.076
Why don't you
work for us full-time?

07:09.120 --> 07:11.463
I like keeping my options open.

07:11.510 --> 07:12.989
We need a_ dedicated
investigator.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.075
You could make more money.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.462
Money's not everything.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.296
Yes, but sometimes
it's something.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.124
I'm good.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.307
I may need
more of this.

07:24.350 --> 07:25.658
Call me.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.304
DIANE:
You said that

07:27.350 --> 07:29.705
Dr. Fisher tricked you
into donating tissue,

07:29.750 --> 07:32.093
but isn't that your signature
there on the release form?

07:32.140 --> 07:33.664
It is. So?

07:33.710 --> 07:35.962
So were you under
the influence

07:36.020 --> 07:38.318
of anesthesia or some other drug
when you signed this?

07:38.370 --> 07:42.238
No.So how did she
trick you?

07:42.280 --> 07:44.328
Well, she said it was
for medical research purposes.

07:44.370 --> 07:46.099
Not to make money.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.583
Uh-huh. And how do you know
it was to make money?

07:48.640 --> 07:51.723
I saw it on the video.And is that when you
started experiencing

07:51.770 --> 07:55.501
these symptoms-- the symptoms
that kept you from work--

07:55.560 --> 07:57.596
right around the time
you saw this video?

07:57.650 --> 07:59.254
I guess.So the
procedure

07:59.300 --> 08:00.688
was ten months ago,

08:00.740 --> 08:03.163
and you've been
experiencing these symptoms

08:03.220 --> 08:04.903
for one week?

08:04.960 --> 08:06.780
Two.Any chance you

08:06.830 --> 08:09.435
went to a doctor and got
a diagnosis in those two weeks?

08:09.480 --> 08:10.913
I haven't had time.But you have

08:10.960 --> 08:14.043
had time to go to the Church
of God in Christ

08:14.100 --> 08:17.263
eight times since
you joined... two weeks ago.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.220
Uh, what do you mean by "join"?

08:19.280 --> 08:22.238
Well, did you
accept the Lord as your savior

08:22.280 --> 08:24.009
two weeks ago during
an altar call

08:24.060 --> 08:26.142
at the Church
of God in Christ?

08:26.200 --> 08:28.714
Is that illegal?

08:28.760 --> 08:30.239
No, not
at all.

08:30.290 --> 08:32.633
but two months ago,
did you give this

08:32.680 --> 08:34.636
anonymous quote to the Tribune?

08:34.680 --> 08:37.683
"Choice is under attack
by right-wing forces

08:37.730 --> 08:39.163
in this country."

08:39.210 --> 08:41.166
So?

08:41.210 --> 08:44.338
So it seems like you tend to go
from one extreme to another.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.346
How did you get that quote?

08:46.390 --> 08:48.381
It's why you pay us.

08:49.650 --> 08:51.470
So what are you gonna do--

08:51.530 --> 08:52.736
bring the
case or not?

08:52.790 --> 08:54.178
Not.Rea|ly?

08:54.220 --> 08:56.131
You made
your pomt.

08:56.180 --> 08:58.091
Wouldn't it be odd if the person
who respected you the most

08:58.140 --> 09:00.188
was the person
you agreed with the least?

09:00.230 --> 09:02.744
That would be odd.I'm putting those
undercover tapes online

09:02.800 --> 09:04.097
and seeing
if anybody

09:06.670 --> 09:09.537
Well, that was easy.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.301
[phone rings]

09:43.800 --> 09:45.449
Hey, Grace, what's up?

09:47.100 --> 09:49.443
No, I don't know anyone in need.
Why do you ask?

09:49.500 --> 09:50.842
Are things that bad over there?

09:50.890 --> 09:52.710
Oh, Grace, hold on a minute.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.887
PAIGE [muffled]: ...but I'm the
one who just wrote a check.

09:54.940 --> 09:57.716
Grace, I got to go. I'll
call you if I think of anyone.

09:57.770 --> 10:00.853
Uh, Ms. Paige. Hello.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.858
Mr. Gold. Hi.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.458
I was wondering if I'd see you.

10:05.510 --> 10:07.466
Eli, please.

10:07.510 --> 10:09.649
Do you have a minute? There's
something I'd like to...

10:09.690 --> 10:13.512
you know, say
or-or discuss.

10:18.570 --> 10:20.526
Uh, th-this is temporary.

10:20.570 --> 10:23.562
Mm. It's fine.
Very... cozy.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.315
Um...

10:25.360 --> 10:27.521
Oh, thank you.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.571
[clears throat]

10:31.710 --> 10:33.758
Actually, I'm sorry,
I have to... Could Ijust...

10:33.800 --> 10:35.791
Oh, sorry.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.321
Excuse me.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.891
[clears throat]

10:46.340 --> 10:48.285
I have something to discuss.

10:48.340 --> 10:49.420
Have I done something wrong?

10:49.470 --> 10:51.518
No, no, no... What do you mean?

10:51.560 --> 10:52.777
Well, you sound serious.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.424
Oh, well,
that's just

10:54.470 --> 10:55.607
who I am.

10:55.650 --> 10:57.083
I'm working on that.

10:57.130 --> 10:59.348
I... I told a joke yesterday.

10:59.390 --> 11:00.345
What was it?

11:00.390 --> 11:02.529
Um, how do you...

11:02.570 --> 11:03.912
No, wh...

11:03.960 --> 11:05.393
qummm.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.919
It'll come back.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.835
It-It's about your business.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.485
And-and actually,
it is a bit serious.

11:11.540 --> 11:14.623
[sighs]
I think I know what it's about.
The salary floor?

11:14.670 --> 11:16.183
Yes.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.401
It's communism, right?No.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.839
Socialism?
No. Well... y-yes,
it is a bit.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.710
I like my employees.
They work hard.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.670
So I decided
to give them all a raise.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.119
To $75,000 for everybody?

11:27.160 --> 11:28.411
Yeah.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.028
It's my money.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.684
Why is that bad?

11:31.730 --> 11:34.073
Oh, it's not bad...
for your employees,

11:34.120 --> 11:36.122
but... for Peter.

11:36.170 --> 11:39.549
Oh. Ah, he's suddenly
a socialist sympathizer.

11:39.610 --> 11:41.566
All the campaign asks
is that you wait

11:41.610 --> 11:44.078
until after_the electio_n
before you give your raises.

11:44.130 --> 11:47.349
Oh, so, there are two fish
in a tank.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.436
[chuckles]
And, um, one fish says

11:49.490 --> 11:52.914
to the other fish,
"How do you drive this thing?"

11:54.490 --> 11:56.310
That was the punch line,
because, you know,

11:56.360 --> 11:57.884
we-we think
they're in fish tank,

11:57.930 --> 12:00.660
but actually,
they're in a... tank tank.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.280
Funny.

12:03.330 --> 12:05.059
[clears his throat]

12:05.110 --> 12:07.499
So, have-have you thought
of the legal ramifications

12:07.550 --> 12:09.586
of giving
everybody $75,000?

12:09.640 --> 12:11.722
Yes, I've discussed it with

12:11.770 --> 12:13.544
my in-house counsel.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.636
How about you hear
from a second opinion?

12:17.560 --> 12:19.994
I don't want to hear it.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.905
No, I... What
do you mean?

12:21.950 --> 12:24.475
You yelling at me
about Landau.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.999
What did you do
with Landau?!

12:26.040 --> 12:28.782
Wait. Why are you here?

12:28.830 --> 12:30.786
Because I have a client.
What happened with Landau?

12:30.830 --> 12:32.218
The election board.

12:32.270 --> 12:33.749
I punted a vote on the machines

12:33.790 --> 12:35.838
by ordering a study,
and Landau's furious.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.745
Because you two had a deal.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.188
I knew it!

12:39.230 --> 12:41.357
Well, let's just
file that one

12:41.410 --> 12:43.662
under ongoing
disasters, shall we?

12:43.710 --> 12:45.666
I'm sending you a client

12:45.720 --> 12:47.449
who just happens
to be a billionaire.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.149
Courtney Paige?

12:49.200 --> 12:51.452
Yes. It's probably just
a couple of hours work,

12:51.500 --> 12:53.502
but you can bill what you want.

12:53.550 --> 12:54.539
[sighs]
Thank you.

12:54.590 --> 12:55.727
Yes, that's all
I want is-is...

12:55.770 --> 12:57.897
is your thanks.
Thank you.
And...

12:57.950 --> 13:00.510
I need you to talk Courtney
out of what she wants to do.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.118
I know, I know,

13:02.170 --> 13:03.774
you can't promise anything--
that would be unethical--

13:03.820 --> 13:05.515
but she's planning
to give everybody

13:05.560 --> 13:08.563
in her company a raise
to $75,000 a year.

13:08.610 --> 13:10.475
It is in her
best interest,

13:10.520 --> 13:12.693
both legally and politically,
notto do so.

13:12.740 --> 13:14.822
Also, it hurts Peter.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.131
That's just
my opinion.

13:16.180 --> 13:17.829
I'm not telling
you how to advise.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.962
You want to encourage her
to chase socialism

13:20.010 --> 13:21.227
to the graveyard of history...

13:21.270 --> 13:22.669
[airy laughing]:
be my guest.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.790
[door closes]

13:26.890 --> 13:29.586
Yes?

13:29.630 --> 13:32.849
Dr. Hallie Fisher is suing
to take down the teaser,

13:32.890 --> 13:35.848
and block the release
of our undercover Video.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.027
And?

13:38.070 --> 13:39.981
And that's bad.

13:40.030 --> 13:41.850
Not for you, but for me.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.379
No, it's prior
restraint.

13:43.430 --> 13:44.852
No judge will allow it.

13:44.910 --> 13:46.855
Go ahead, just put it online.

13:46.910 --> 13:51.347
Judge Margovski already granted
an emergency hearing today.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.863
I know you're no fan of Citizens
for Ethical Medicine,

13:56.920 --> 13:59.172
but this isn't about abortion
anymore.

13:59.220 --> 14:00.869
This is about
the First Amendment.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.877
Which you're using as a weapon

14:04.930 --> 14:07.012
to attack women _
and medicme and ch0ice.

14:07.060 --> 14:10.405
"Anyone can defend a sympathetic
client with popular beliefs.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.759
"The real test
of the First Amendment

14:12.800 --> 14:14.882
"is_ whether
we are Willing to stand up

14:14.940 --> 14:16.623
for people and ideas we hate."

14:16.680 --> 14:18.932
Well, that's more persuasive

14:18.980 --> 14:21.198
and plainspoken
than you normally are.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.899
I was quoting you.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.988
You said that in a speech
to Emily's List.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.294
You may not agree with our tapes
or how they were made,

14:27.340 --> 14:30.639
but prior restraint
is just wrong.

14:30.690 --> 14:33.215
And you know it.

14:33.260 --> 14:35.649
[sighs heavily]

14:35.700 --> 14:38.385
Why do I have
to be so damn convincing?

14:53.760 --> 14:57.457
[loud, overlapping
chatter and shouting]

14:57.500 --> 14:59.934
Just remember,

14:59.980 --> 15:02.414
you're representing
the Constitution.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.547
Diane, hello.
God bless.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.591
I'm Heidi.
I shot the video.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.596
I'm your client.
Hi.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.164
WOMAN:
Stay away from my uterus!

15:12.210 --> 15:13.723
We don't want
your dirty uterus!

15:13.780 --> 15:15.600
Sorry, Diane.
Just ignore her.

15:15.650 --> 15:17.777
You know I'm not pro-life.

15:17.820 --> 15:19.253
Yes, I know technically,

15:19.300 --> 15:20.608
but you're here to
show your support.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.208
No, I'm not here
to show anything.

15:22.260 --> 15:23.693
Stop killing women!

15:23.740 --> 15:25.344
WOMAN:
Stop killing children!

15:25.400 --> 15:29.393
This secret tape is already
causing irreparable damage

15:29.450 --> 15:31.964
to the important work that
Dr. Fisher does, Your Honor.

15:32.010 --> 15:33.659
Stand up, Hallie.

15:33.710 --> 15:35.758
[applause, cheering, booing]MAN: Yeah!
MAN: No!

15:35.800 --> 15:37.700
No! No! People.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.011
[gallery quiets]

15:39.060 --> 15:40.584
Let's get this clear.

15:40.630 --> 15:41.847
You're guests here.

15:41.890 --> 15:43.369
That's all.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.808
No waving of signs, no...

15:44.850 --> 15:47.637
In fact, John,
let's collect those signs, okay?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.853
Thank you. Go
ahead, Counselor.[gallery murmuring]

15:49.900 --> 15:52.027
WOMAN: When I was
growing up in the Bronx,

15:52.080 --> 15:54.640
there was one thing
I was always told.

15:54.690 --> 15:56.169
Sneaks can't be rewarded

15:56.210 --> 15:57.723
for sneaking.

15:57.780 --> 15:59.259
Your Honor,
this isn't about sneaks.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.689
This is a textbook case
of prior restraint.

16:01.740 --> 16:03.696
If we're against it
with the Pentagon Papers,

16:03.740 --> 16:05.651
we should be against it here.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.088
Now that offends me.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.392
I know Danny Ellsberg, and
this woman is nothing like...

16:09.440 --> 16:11.908
Then sue... after the fact.
If you think there is harm,

16:11.970 --> 16:14.313
the proper remedy
is a suit for damages.She's not

16:14.360 --> 16:15.702
wrong, Ms. Steel. The law

16:15.750 --> 16:17.923
strongly disfavors
this kind of censorship.

16:17.970 --> 16:20.757
Yes, except that this
secret tape was made illegally.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.108
Illinois again
requires two-party consent.

16:22.150 --> 16:23.970
Hallie, did you consent
to this tape?

16:24.020 --> 16:26.011
I did not.There. One party.

16:26.070 --> 16:27.879
Consent wasn't necessary
here, Your Honor.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.760
The conversation took place
in a crowded yogurt shop.

16:29.810 --> 16:32.119
There was_ no reasonable
expectation of privacy.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.809
_ Of course there was
expectation of privacy.DIANE: Your Honor...

16:33.860 --> 16:35.760
She's alone at a table...[chatter overlaps]
No, no, no.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.026
Let's look at the tape

16:37.080 --> 16:38.945
and see
if this yogurt shop was crowded.

16:38.990 --> 16:40.685
Actually, Your Honor,

16:40.730 --> 16:42.379
I would suggest
that the very reason

16:42.430 --> 16:43.818
for this pre-trial motion

16:43.870 --> 16:45.519
would preclude the gallery

16:45.560 --> 16:47.084
from seeing this tape,
this secrettape.

16:47.130 --> 16:48.176
You want me to clear the court?

16:48.220 --> 16:49.824
Until you rule on our motion,

16:49.870 --> 16:52.338
Your Honor, this tape should
not see the light of clay.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.789
John, let's go.

16:54.830 --> 16:56.570
All right, everybody,
I'll ask you

16:56.620 --> 16:58.929
to grab your things, step out.[gallery members groaning]

16:58.970 --> 17:02.019
God bless you,
Diane. Thank you.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.796
FISHER [on video]:
There was one day where,

17:05.850 --> 17:07.056
as I was working my forceps

17:07.110 --> 17:08.805
into position,
trying to get a good grip,

17:08.850 --> 17:11.717
I was literally almost
doubled over from cramps.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.638
As you can see, Your Honor--

17:14.680 --> 17:16.932
I think it's pretty clear--
the yogurt shop was crowded,

17:16.990 --> 17:18.412
and there was no expectation
of privacy.

17:18.470 --> 17:19.892
Wait, wait.

17:19.950 --> 17:21.906
Is that all you
need from the tape?

17:21.950 --> 17:23.906
Yes, Your Honor.John, bring them back in.

17:23.950 --> 17:25.941
Let's go, everybody in.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.251
MARGOVSKI:
Okay, go ahead.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.949
There is no expectation
of privacy, Your Honor.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.820
They were three feet
from the next table.

17:30.870 --> 17:32.383
Which was occupied by children.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.429
So?

17:33.480 --> 17:35.084
So, like my mom used to say--

17:35.140 --> 17:36.744
stick to the main tent
and avoid the sideshows.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.564
What does that even mean?

17:38.620 --> 17:40.611
It means that children
do not undermine

17:40.660 --> 17:41.786
the expectation of privacy

17:41.840 --> 17:43.660
because they don't have
the capacity

17:43.710 --> 17:45.314
to understand what it means.CARY:
But their mother

17:45.360 --> 17:47.009
came and joined them
at the table,

17:47.060 --> 17:49.233
and Dr. Fisher still carried on
With no expectation of privacy.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.793
That is not true.Look at the tape.

17:50.850 --> 17:53.808
You're kidding.

17:53.850 --> 17:56.580
Sheriff, we need
to clear the court.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.801
WOMAN:
Come on![gallery members groaning]

17:58.860 --> 18:00.851
I don't remember
when he got divorced.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.425
Um, maybe seven,
eight years ago. Why?

18:03.470 --> 18:05.335
Oh, just curious.

18:05.380 --> 18:08.122
Well, Eli has
a daughter. Marissa.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.121
He's a good guy...
for a political animal.

18:13.170 --> 18:14.956
Well, I know why
Eli doesn't want

18:15.000 --> 18:18.561
a salary floor, but what
do you think of it, legally?

18:18.610 --> 18:20.692
Well, shareholders
may feel devalued,

18:20.750 --> 18:22.308
and clients may feel insulted.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.749
You think they'll sue?

18:24.790 --> 18:25.961
Potentially.

18:26.010 --> 18:27.659
Senior employees may be

18:27.710 --> 18:33.148
upset that new hires are making
almost as much from day one.

18:33.190 --> 18:35.977
You might want
to offer a sliding scale

18:36.020 --> 18:40.320
where senior employees
get the largest raises.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.280
Do you know Matthew 20?

18:42.330 --> 18:44.059
Do I...? No.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.894
Um, I'm sure my daughter does.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.156
All the hired hands

18:47.210 --> 18:48.723
are given the same pay.

18:48.770 --> 18:50.818
The last who arrived
and the first who worked

18:50.860 --> 18:52.122
in the heat of the day.

18:52.170 --> 18:53.683
Why?

18:53.740 --> 18:55.776
Because "The last
shall be first

18:55.830 --> 18:57.309
and the first shall be last."

18:57.350 --> 18:59.170
Okay, um, but I do know

18:59.220 --> 19:02.872
that Bible stories aren't
usually the best busmess plans.

19:02.920 --> 19:06.879
Yes, but you know
what the bottom line is.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.922
It's your money.

19:08.970 --> 19:10.312
Amen.

19:18.020 --> 19:20.807
There. That's the mother.

19:20.850 --> 19:22.021
No kids, no sideshow. Adults.

19:22.070 --> 19:23.799
STEEL:
Yes,

19:23.850 --> 19:26.193
but Dr. Fisher was whispering,
which demonstrates her desire

19:26.250 --> 19:27.763
to keep the conversation
private.

19:27.810 --> 19:30.813
Oh, come on. It demonstrates
her awareness that she was

19:30.860 --> 19:32.634
in a public place where
she could be overheard.

19:32.690 --> 19:33.987
Wait a minute.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.998
Sheriff, you know
what we're missing.

19:37.040 --> 19:40.214
Oh, do I, Your Honor.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.218
We're open for business.
Hear ye, hear ye.

19:43.260 --> 19:45.137
So what does whispering mean?

19:45.180 --> 19:47.876
I think it means
Ms. Lockhart is right.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.263
The yogurt shop did not
afford a reasonable

19:50.310 --> 19:51.868
expectation of privacy.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.228
Motion denied.
Any other motions?

19:53.270 --> 19:54.874
Your Honor, yes.

19:54.930 --> 19:57.535
We ask for a recess
to prepare a new one.

19:57.580 --> 20:00.401
[elevator bell dings]RECEPTIONIST: Lockhart,
Agos & Lee. Please hold.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.849
Bea. I didn't know
we had an appointment.

20:02.890 --> 20:04.323
We don't, but we need to talk.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.849
ETHAN:
Ms. Wilson,
Ethan Carver.

20:07.510 --> 20:08.841
for National Council
on Women's Rights.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.765
And I recognize you

20:10.810 --> 20:12.539
from the congressional hearings
on defunding Planned Parenthood.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.022
Uh, why don't you two
wait in the office?

20:14.080 --> 20:16.423
I think that's
a good idea.
Mm.

20:16.470 --> 20:19.030
How can you do this?
Bea,

20:19.080 --> 20:21.423
if you're talking about this
case, it's not about choice.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.959
It's about the
First Amendment.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.160
That's a nice,
neat justification.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.778
The pro-choice
position isn't

20:25.830 --> 20:26.910
so weak that it can't stand up

20:26.960 --> 20:28.268
to the marketplace of ideas.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.266
This isn't about censorship.

20:30.310 --> 20:33.962
This is about an orchestrated,
right-wing war on women.

20:34.010 --> 20:35.966
Bea, I will join you in arguing

20:36.010 --> 20:37.921
against the substance
of these tapes,

20:37.970 --> 20:39.926
but only after
they're made public.

20:39.970 --> 20:42.279
But that's insane. We wouldn't
have to argue against them

20:42.320 --> 20:43.799
if they weren't made public.

20:43.850 --> 20:46.933
[elevator bell dings]

20:46.980 --> 20:49.972
Oh. Excuse me.

20:50.030 --> 20:53.329
Hey. I think I know what
they have, the opposition.

20:53.380 --> 20:56.110
What is it?

20:56.160 --> 20:58.856
A non-disclosure agreement.

20:58.900 --> 21:02.996
The Citizens for Ethical
Medicine employees signed a NDA

21:03.040 --> 21:05.554
at the conference before
sitting down with Dr. Fisher,

21:05.610 --> 21:07.771
which expressly prohibits any

21:07.830 --> 21:10.788
recording or dissemination
of information.I see that.

21:10.830 --> 21:13.003
This seems pretty ironclad,
Diane.

21:13.050 --> 21:14.779
It's a contract of adhesion,
Your Honor.

21:14.830 --> 21:16.650
It's an asymmetrical
agreement foisted

21:16.710 --> 21:18.962
on someone ill-equipped
to know what she was signing.

21:19.010 --> 21:20.659
"Ill-equipped?" Really?

21:20.710 --> 21:22.359
Three pages
of non-optional legalese.

21:22.410 --> 21:23.832
This is no different than
the preposterous user agreements

21:23.890 --> 21:25.699
we all click "agree" on.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.239
STEEL:
There's a big difference.
The online agreements

21:27.280 --> 21:28.793
don't leave any room

21:28.850 --> 21:31.011
for you to make alterations
or amendments.

21:31.070 --> 21:32.230
And, Your Honor, sneaks...

21:32.290 --> 21:33.894
Can't be rewarded for sneaking.

21:33.940 --> 21:36.454
I know that, and I agree.

21:36.510 --> 21:38.239
This non-disclosure
agreement holds.

21:38.290 --> 21:41.111
[cheering, gavel bangs]

21:41.160 --> 21:44.163
Do you have any other arguments,
Diane?

21:47.170 --> 21:49.218
Courtney's ex-husband's

21:49.260 --> 21:51.512
suing her for breach
of fiduciary duty.

21:51.570 --> 21:53.379
What?
Mm-hmm.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.044
He's still a partner
in the company.

21:55.090 --> 21:58.617
I thought her lawyer
would know that.

21:58.660 --> 22:02.835
Who are you calling?[sighs]

22:02.880 --> 22:05.053
STEEL:
Well, she wasn't the duped,
she was the duper.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.887
[phone buzzing]Your Honor, once again, this is
an overbroad interpretation.

22:07.930 --> 22:09.181
Listen, if she
was not willing

22:09.240 --> 22:10.889
to accept the
conference's rules...

22:12.980 --> 22:15.585
Alicia, did you find
a new client?

22:15.630 --> 22:17.154
_ Yes and no.
Eli referred someone.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.929
Not just someone--
a very rich

22:18.980 --> 22:20.504
and a very powerful
someone.
Shh.

22:23.380 --> 22:24.597
I need you to look into him.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.948
His name...

22:25.990 --> 22:27.070
Larry Oliver.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.849
Did you get that?

22:28.910 --> 22:29.945
I got it.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.251
What am I looking for?

22:31.300 --> 22:32.949
Any weaknesses, vulnerabilities.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.217
ELI: Maybe it would help
to know why they divorced.

22:34.260 --> 22:35.773
Jason, do you
have a minute?

22:35.830 --> 22:37.559
DIANE:
I need an answer, now.

22:37.610 --> 22:38.861
You have to go?

22:38.920 --> 22:40.524
Yeah. Can I call you back?

22:40.570 --> 22:42.174
Sure.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.790
What's wrong?

22:44.840 --> 22:45.909
Nothing.

22:45.970 --> 22:47.392
GRACE:
Yes, I'm calling from

22:47.450 --> 22:49.577
the law offices
of Florrick/Quinn.

22:49.620 --> 22:52.362
The Midwest offices.

22:52.410 --> 22:53.752
I'd like to set a meeting

22:53.800 --> 22:56.064
to discuss what our firm
can do for you.

22:57.330 --> 23:00.060
Okay, sure. Thank you.

Good afternoon, I'm calling
from the Midwest offices

24:13.660 --> 24:15.059
of Florrick/Quinn.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.180
I'd like to set a meeting

24:16.230 --> 24:18.016
to discuss what our firm
can do for you.

24:18.060 --> 24:19.925
Oh, could you hold on
a second.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.493
Let me close my door.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.064
[ringing phones, chatter
volume lowers]

24:23.110 --> 24:24.623
That's much better.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.011
Would you mind transferring me

24:26.070 --> 24:28.106
_to whoever deals
With out5ide counsel?

24:28.160 --> 24:30.196
Oh, really?

24:30.250 --> 24:32.195
You're looking for a new firm?

24:32.250 --> 24:34.502
Well, that's great news.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.859
Do you mind transferring me
to...

24:37.910 --> 24:39.684
whoever I should talk to.

24:39.730 --> 24:41.812
Thank you.

24:41.870 --> 24:43.087
[phone rings]

24:43.130 --> 24:44.688
This is Bea Wilson

24:44.740 --> 24:46.389
at National Council
on Women's Rights.

24:46.440 --> 24:47.862
Who am I speaking to?

24:47.920 --> 24:50.047
Grace Florrick

24:50.090 --> 24:52.046
at Florrick, Quinn
& Associates.

24:52.090 --> 24:55.173
I was hoping
we could discuss possibly

24:55.230 --> 24:57.664
representing your organization

24:57.710 --> 25:01.009
in all of its legal concerns
and issues.

25:01.060 --> 25:02.539
And so on.

25:02.580 --> 25:04.844
Yes, I would like that.

25:04.890 --> 25:06.198
We're just in the process

25:06.240 --> 25:08.708
of considering moving
our legal business.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.672
When would you be able
to accommodate us?

25:11.720 --> 25:13.415
Accommodate you?

25:13.460 --> 25:15.928
As in becoming your law firm?

25:15.990 --> 25:17.378
Yes.

25:17.420 --> 25:19.888
This is Florrick/Quinn
as in Alicia Florrick, yes?

25:19.950 --> 25:21.724
Yes.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.816
We've worked with her before.

25:23.870 --> 25:26.646
When could we make
the transfer?

25:26.690 --> 25:28.567
Wh...

25:28.610 --> 25:29.736
Wh-Whenever you want.

25:29.780 --> 25:30.997
Good.

25:31.050 --> 25:32.529
Please call me tomorrow,

25:32.570 --> 25:33.821
and I'll send over
the necessary papers.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.872
[low chatter continues]

25:49.330 --> 25:50.843
Mrs. Lockhart,

25:50.890 --> 25:52.198
if you ever need anything,

25:52.240 --> 25:53.935
I'm one of the new
assoaates—- Brian.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.288

Lockhart.

25:55.330 --> 25:56.581
Oh, that's right, sorry.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.414
Use me in any way you want.

25:58.460 --> 26:01.020
Carrying boxes,
killing spiders.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.115
[laughs]

26:02.160 --> 26:03.468
Brian, can you give us a minute?

26:03.510 --> 26:04.647
Sure. That I can do.

26:04.690 --> 26:05.907
Get out of the way.

26:07.260 --> 26:09.683
Good hires, these smart ones.

26:09.740 --> 26:11.640
[sighs]

26:11.700 --> 26:14.260
That was Mike and Ginger
from the Justice Center.

26:14.310 --> 26:15.732
They're leaving.

26:17.090 --> 26:19.172
This is a First Amendment case.

26:19.220 --> 26:21.131
I know that, and you know that,
but they don't know that.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.319
Then have them talk to me.They don't want to be argued
out of their position.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.316
There isn't much _
neutral ground on abortion.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.440
On free speech.

26:26.490 --> 26:28.924
Your Honor, we will stipulate

26:28.970 --> 26:30.619
that the non-disclosure
agreement

26:30.670 --> 26:32.365
applied on the premises,

26:32.410 --> 26:34.321
_but the conversation
did not take place there.

26:34.370 --> 26:36.452
They met at the conference
and were on

26:36.500 --> 26:38.582
an officially scheduled break.Off-premises.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.244
You're saying the conversation
wasn't covered

26:40.290 --> 26:41.723
by the non-disclosure agreement

26:41.770 --> 26:43.328
because it happened
somewhere else?

26:43.380 --> 26:45.336
Yes.Your Honor,
we can show that the trip

26:45.380 --> 26:47.814
to the yogurt store was just
an extension of the conference,

26:47.860 --> 26:50.249
but we will need to see
the Video again.

26:50.300 --> 26:51.813

RECEPTIONIST:
Canning & Associates.

26:55.870 --> 26:57.474
Lucca.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.829
I will see you now.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.747
Don't look now, but the guy
I kicked out of your office

27:01.790 --> 27:03.394
just walked by.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.873
Why would you do that?

27:04.920 --> 27:06.262
Well, where else
are you going to work?

27:06.320 --> 27:08.049
A shared office?
Out of your home?

27:08.100 --> 27:09.226
I haven't taken the job

27:09.270 --> 27:11.352
and you haven't
made your pitch.

27:11.410 --> 27:12.889
If you really want me here...

27:12.930 --> 27:14.238
We're gonna play
let's make a deal.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.884
But if you say "yes,"

27:15.930 --> 27:19.275
you get What's behind
all three doors.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.548
Montego-Portmore Estates.

27:21.590 --> 27:24.673
It's the second largest
hospitality chain in Jamaica

27:24.730 --> 27:26.288
and soon to be your client.

27:26.340 --> 27:29.207
Your dad's Jamaican;
they'll like that.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.860
Arthur Beadle
and Sons.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.207
The department store?

27:34.260 --> 27:35.295
Yeah, one of the sons
had some trouble.

27:35.340 --> 27:36.944
He's in and out of prison.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.560
Your work as a bar attorney
will go a long way with Arthur.

27:39.610 --> 27:41.214
This one's special.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.989
LUCCA:
Inner Heart Hope?

27:43.050 --> 27:44.438
They perform
low-cost surgeries

27:44.480 --> 27:46.914
in Third World nations
via remote feed.

27:46.960 --> 27:50.179
They need
someone like you.

27:50.230 --> 27:52.573
Look, I want you, Lucca,

27:52.620 --> 27:54.406
not Alicia,

27:54.450 --> 27:56.099
so give it some thought

27:56.150 --> 27:58.710
but I need to know
within 24 hours.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.364
So?

28:00.410 --> 28:02.935
You ever hear that joke
about the Irish guy

28:02.980 --> 28:04.413
who goes to confession?

28:04.460 --> 28:05.973
I can't say
that I have.

28:06.030 --> 28:07.509
He says he's committed adultery.

28:07.550 --> 28:08.892
The priest asks,

28:08.940 --> 28:10.419
[Irish accent]:
"Was it Mrs. O'Leary?"

28:10.470 --> 28:11.459
The guy says no.

28:11.510 --> 28:12.761
"Mrs. O'Grady?"

28:12.820 --> 28:14.071
No.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.428
"Mrs. O'Donnell?"

28:15.470 --> 28:16.687
Still no.

28:16.730 --> 28:19.119
Guy walks out of confessional
and says,

28:19.170 --> 28:22.082
"I got three good leads."

28:22.130 --> 28:23.825
Canning gave you names?

28:23.870 --> 28:26.304
Montego-Portmore Estates,
Arthur Beadle,

28:26.350 --> 28:28.079
and Inner Heart Hope.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.916
They add up
to $10 million.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.744
I called them all
on the way over.

28:32.790 --> 28:34.132
We can pitch them tomorrow.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.316
Mm-hmm.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.442
Not here-- it'll
look like a hobby.

28:37.490 --> 28:39.310
GRACE:
Hey, Mom.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.497
I got a client.

28:40.540 --> 28:43.054
That's great, honey.
Good job.

28:43.110 --> 28:44.452
We'll be right back.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.968
[phone ringing]

28:48.070 --> 28:51.062
[ringing continues]

28:51.120 --> 28:53.372
[low chatter]

28:55.600 --> 28:56.726
[chatter becomes louder]

28:56.770 --> 28:59.113
Hello, Florrick, Quinn
& Associates.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.558
This is Grace.
How may I help you?

29:00.600 --> 29:03.068
Hello, this is Ginger Gaye
from the Justice Center.

29:03.130 --> 29:05.826
Bea Wilson from NCW
gave me your number

29:05.870 --> 29:07.428
and said you might be open
to new clients.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.345
Yes. I think we are.

29:09.390 --> 29:11.176
What was your business again,
ma'am?

29:11.220 --> 29:12.346
The Justice Center.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.482
I know we're not as big as NCW,

29:14.530 --> 29:17.784
but we have $2 million a year
in billing, and growing.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.444
We're moving on from
Lockhart, Agos & Lee.

29:19.490 --> 29:21.663
Yes. I mean,
we are a little busy,

29:21.710 --> 29:24.668
but we're never too busy
for a business like yours.

29:24.710 --> 29:27.053
[low chatter]

29:27.110 --> 29:28.805
I have a couple minutes.
Walk and talk?

29:28.850 --> 29:31.455
HEIDI:
Great.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.799
As you can see, the conversation
starts at the conference

29:34.860 --> 29:38.466
in the hotel and continues
as they walk across the street

29:38.510 --> 29:40.068
to the yogurt shop.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.428
Ms. Steel is right.

29:41.470 --> 29:42.949
The conversation was continuous,

29:42.990 --> 29:44.252
which makes this meeting
essentially

29:44.300 --> 29:45.779
an extension of the conference.

29:45.820 --> 29:48.209
The nondisclosure agreement
holds.

29:48.260 --> 29:50.649
The release of the full video
is hereby enjoined.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.429
DIANE:
Your Honor, we ask for a recess

29:52.480 --> 29:54.789
to prepare another motion.

29:54.830 --> 29:55.785
[quietly]:
Let it go.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.226
Granted.

29:59.270 --> 30:01.226
Recess for lunch.[bangs gavel]

30:01.270 --> 30:03.261
Ms. Lockhart,
do you have a moment?

30:03.320 --> 30:04.617
Uh, no, I don't.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.058
There's still a way
you can fight this.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.624
Maybe we can talk
another time.

30:07.670 --> 30:08.796
Cary.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.056
She's a Whistle-blower.

30:10.110 --> 30:11.452
Try the whistle-blower
statute.

30:13.850 --> 30:16.068
LARRY: _
Quote the Bible
all you want, Court,

30:16.110 --> 30:18.419
but you're just trying to screw
me out of what is mine.

30:18.460 --> 30:20.462
PAIGE:
No, Larry, I'm trying
to make a difference.

30:20.510 --> 30:23.331
Which is something you would
know nothing about.

30:23.380 --> 30:25.507
LARRY:
I went to Cambodia.
Sri Lanka.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.516
All to film footage
for Citizen Nonino.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.902
What do you call that?

30:28.950 --> 30:30.645
Squandering my money on
making experimental films

30:30.690 --> 30:34.251
that nobody has
or will ever see.

30:34.310 --> 30:35.607
If I may offer a solution.

30:35.650 --> 30:37.129
What if instead
of a salary floor,

30:37.180 --> 30:38.909
your employees received

30:38.960 --> 30:41.269
unlimited vacation
and Sick days?

30:41.310 --> 30:43.266
Alicia?

30:43.310 --> 30:46.575
Yes. That is one way
you could go.

30:48.150 --> 30:51.278
Do you, um, rent out
that conference room?

30:52.760 --> 30:54.273
Your Honor, at this time
my client would like to file

30:54.330 --> 30:55.536
pursuant to the Illinois
False Claims Act.

30:55.590 --> 30:57.069
MARGOVSKI:
The Whistle-blower statute?

30:57.110 --> 30:59.158
All due respect, Judge,

30:59.200 --> 31:00.542
but this is What my mother
would call "fercockt."

31:00.590 --> 31:01.716
Who is your Whistle-blower?

31:01.770 --> 31:03.112
She is.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.025
Diane, you are amazing.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.377
I admire you so much.

31:06.420 --> 31:07.944
Your Honor,
as my father would say,

31:07.990 --> 31:10.424
this is like putting an ass's
bridle on a Model T Ford.

31:10.470 --> 31:13.519
Okay,
I don't even get that one.

31:13.560 --> 31:14.902
The 8th Street
Clinic receives

31:14.960 --> 31:17.121
state funding for procedures
they perform,

31:17.170 --> 31:19.343
which they are misrepresenting.

31:19.390 --> 31:21.699
The tapes demonstrate
that fraud,

31:21.740 --> 31:23.389
and therefore
they cannot be censored.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.260
MARGOVSKI:
It's a creative claim,
Ms. Lockhart.

31:25.310 --> 31:26.652
Please approach.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.613
We need to talk.

31:32.670 --> 31:35.662
This is not ex parte,
but we need to talk.

31:35.710 --> 31:36.665
Whenever you want, Your Honor.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.233
Now.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.622
Diane, what are you doing here?

31:39.680 --> 31:41.284
Your Honor?

31:41.330 --> 31:44.629
Please, stop with
the "Your Honor."

31:44.680 --> 31:46.671
This is just "Ben."

31:46.730 --> 31:48.766
You really think your client
is a whistle-blower?

31:48.810 --> 31:50.289
She was reporting
a public fraud.

31:50.340 --> 31:51.682
To whom?

31:51.730 --> 31:53.857
She didn't serve notice
to this court.

31:53.910 --> 31:55.992
Did she notify
the SA's office?

31:56.040 --> 31:57.644
The Attorney General?
The FBI?

31:57.690 --> 31:59.169
No, but...Then under the statute

31:59.220 --> 32:01.916
she has not provided
proper notice.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.428
Then she posted
the video online.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.471
Are you telling me
that this doesn't satisfy

32:06.530 --> 32:09.522
the spirit
of the notice requirement?

32:09.570 --> 32:12.050
I'm telling you
it's too much of a reach.

32:12.100 --> 32:13.704
And even more so,
I don't understand

32:13.750 --> 32:16.878
why you're trying
so damn hard to make it.

32:16.930 --> 32:19.103
Diane, I've known you
for a long time

32:19.150 --> 32:21.050
and this...

32:21.110 --> 32:23.624
this is not your case.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.411
Are you saying that I shouldn't
pursue this case

32:27.460 --> 32:29.724
because of my politics?

32:32.600 --> 32:34.556
because it's not you.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.556
This is about free speech,
and you know it.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.420
No, I don't know it.

32:38.470 --> 32:40.074
This undercover tape
is disgusting.

32:40.130 --> 32:41.688
It's like James O'Keefe
with ACORN.

32:41.740 --> 32:44.163
It's like all right Wing
Republicans.

32:44.220 --> 32:45.699
They don't play fair.

32:45.740 --> 32:48.823
This is...

32:48.870 --> 32:51.134
You can't be telling me this.

32:51.180 --> 32:52.568
And yet I am.

32:52.620 --> 32:55.134
I want you to stop trying
to make this work.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.226
So let's go back out there,

32:57.270 --> 32:59.966
put this to bed,
and make sure those videos

33:00.020 --> 33:01.669
never see the light of day.

33:03.370 --> 33:06.407
What happened?

33:08.460 --> 33:10.803
Your plaintiff
who had the abortion,

33:10.850 --> 33:12.670
Stacy Groom.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.028
The one you ripped apart?

33:14.070 --> 33:16.072
Yes.

33:17.340 --> 33:20.161
We're putting her on the stand.

33:27.260 --> 33:28.511
Thank you for coming.We—we know you're very busy.

33:28.570 --> 33:30.253
I am, but...
We understandAs my father

33:30.310 --> 33:33.689
you're not entirely hap...would say, Wha gwan.

33:33.750 --> 33:36.742
We'd like to tell
you about our firm.

33:36.790 --> 33:38.701
It's not as big
as Canning's,

33:38.750 --> 33:40.798
but we see that
as a plus.Do you travel?

33:40.840 --> 33:42.319
Do I? Oh, yes,
I love to.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.089
We're opening hotels
throughout the Caribbean.

33:44.150 --> 33:47.278
We need manpower.
How many partners do you have?

33:47.320 --> 33:49.322
Six, currently.Two.

33:49.370 --> 33:50.712
But what we lack
in numbers,

33:50.760 --> 33:52.489
we make up for
in aggressiveness.

33:52.550 --> 33:55.451
And experience,
Mr. Beadle.

33:55.510 --> 33:57.592
At a firm
like Florrick & Agos,

33:57.640 --> 34:00.894
Quinn.we... What? Oh.
Excuse me.

34:00.950 --> 34:04.420
At a firm
like Florrick & Quinn,

34:04.470 --> 34:07.519
what we're most proud of
is our corporate work.

34:07.560 --> 34:11.564
I'm sorry, not corporate.
Our charitable work.

34:11.610 --> 34:14.864
So... we'll look fonNard
to hearing from you.

34:16.050 --> 34:19.486
Well, that didn't go... well.

34:19.530 --> 34:20.781
Nope.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.183
Florrick/Agos?Criminal litigation?

34:23.230 --> 34:25.482
His son.No, he doesn't want
to be reminded of that.

34:25.540 --> 34:26.837
Plus, six partners?

34:26.890 --> 34:28.960
I was thinking futuristically.Lucca...

34:29.020 --> 34:31.102
[indistinct chatter]GRACE:
No, there's no question.

34:31.150 --> 34:33.618
Diane Lockhart's
an excellent lawyer.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.750
But we have the expertise...[horses neighing]

34:35.810 --> 34:39.029
One second, Jojo.

34:39.070 --> 34:40.628
[neighing continues][spokesperson speaking
indistinctly]

34:40.680 --> 34:42.545
SPOKESPERSON:
Lippincott Mutual.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.852
Sorry, Jojo.

34:44.900 --> 34:47.368
One of our lavwers
is actually dealing with horses.

34:47.430 --> 34:49.386
[chuckles]
I know.

34:49.430 --> 34:51.159
Good help these days.

34:51.210 --> 34:53.166
So, yes, I actually do think

34:53.220 --> 34:56.121
we can squeeze in a meeting
tomorrow.DIANE: Ms. Groom,

34:56.180 --> 34:57.477
did the 8th Street
Clinic

34:57.530 --> 34:59.521
perform an abortion on you?Objection.

34:59.570 --> 35:01.390
What is the relevance
of this witness?I was

35:01.440 --> 35:02.998
wondering that myself.Ms. Groom
is

35:03.050 --> 35:05.223
a private citizen who believes
she has been defrauded

35:05.270 --> 35:06.612
and is now reporting it.

35:06.660 --> 35:09.311
Here.
To this court.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.180
She is our whistle-blower.

35:11.230 --> 35:14.313
Objection overruled.

35:14.370 --> 35:16.326
Proceed.

35:16.370 --> 35:19.282
Ms. Groom,
did the 8th Street Clinic

35:19.330 --> 35:21.195
perform an abortion on you?They did.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.288
Ten months ago.And did
Dr. Hallie Fisher

35:23.330 --> 35:25.207
perform that abortion? The woman

35:25.250 --> 35:26.808
in the video?
And didYes.

35:26.860 --> 35:28.509
she accurately
represent that procedure

35:28.560 --> 35:30.118
to you?No.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.126
_ She t_ricked me_
into donating fetal tissue.

35:32.170 --> 35:34.126
She never told me
it would be sold.

35:34.170 --> 35:37.344
She even flipped the baby
into a breech position

35:37.390 --> 35:39.642
to help better harvest
the organs.Objection.

35:39.700 --> 35:43.261
Misstates evidence. There's been _
no testimony to this effect.Are you denying

35:43.310 --> 35:45.266
that Ms. Groom's abortion
involved a breech?

35:45.310 --> 35:47.437
No. I'm saying
there's no evidence as to cause.

35:47.490 --> 35:49.264
Yes, because you've
denied us that evidence.

35:49.320 --> 35:53.438
We need a hearing on acquiring
the 8th Street Clinic's

35:53.490 --> 35:55.708
medical records.Objection
sustained.

35:55.760 --> 35:59.321
Do you have any more questions
for this Witness, Ms. Lockhart?

35:59.370 --> 36:02.157
I do not.

36:04.030 --> 36:07.193
Ms. Groom, these symptoms
you discuss,

36:07.250 --> 36:09.332
have you reported
them to a doctor?

36:09.380 --> 36:10.335
Yes_.
I received

36:10.380 --> 36:12.462
a PTSD diagnosis.Really?

36:12.510 --> 36:13.465
When was that?

36:13.510 --> 36:14.772
Yesterday.Yesterday?

36:14.820 --> 36:17.459
Great_.
Before your testimony here.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.384
Objection, Your Honor.Overruled.

36:18.430 --> 36:19.385
You said that Dr. Fisher

36:19.430 --> 36:20.601
tricked you

36:20.650 --> 36:21.958
into donating tissue.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.342
How did she do that?She said

36:23.390 --> 36:25.176
the donation was
for research purposes

36:25.220 --> 36:27.176
and my health
wouldn't be compromised.

36:27.220 --> 36:29.302
And it wasn't,
was it?She said on the video

36:29.360 --> 36:33.091
_ babies are moved
into a breech p05ition.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.363
Ms. Groom, When did you join
the Church of God in Christ?

36:38.410 --> 36:41.049
Objection, Your Honor.
No. It is an indictmentGoes to state of mind.

36:41.110 --> 36:43.533
of this woman's beliefs,
and that's outrageous.

36:43.590 --> 36:45.751
What happened to constitutional
freedoms?
This woman was _
pro-ch0ice. She had an abortion

36:45.810 --> 36:48.108
of her own free will...

36:48.160 --> 36:51.379
Yes. Yes.

36:51.420 --> 36:54.378
Uh, absolutely.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.809
Mm-hmm.

36:56.860 --> 36:59.294
Um...

36:59.340 --> 37:01.604
sure.

37:04.480 --> 37:05.777
Well, when?

37:05.830 --> 37:08.298
Okay.

37:08.350 --> 37:10.693
Um...

37:10.750 --> 37:12.524
Uh, tomorrow.

37:12.570 --> 37:14.526
Thank you.
Okay.

37:14.580 --> 37:17.526
Bye.

37:17.580 --> 37:18.968
Nice picture of you
and the Pope.

37:19.010 --> 37:20.966
Thanks.

37:21.020 --> 37:23.488
Did you decide what
you wanted to do

37:23.540 --> 37:26.327
with, you know,
the unlimited vacation days?

37:26.370 --> 37:29.669
Eli, what are you doing here?

37:29.720 --> 37:32.371
Why am I...

37:35.250 --> 37:36.979
And your concern
is Governor Florrick?

37:37.030 --> 37:39.498
Yes. What
do you mean?

37:39.560 --> 37:42.984
Well, it's important
to understand motives,

37:43.040 --> 37:44.553
don't you think?

37:45.560 --> 37:47.516
Always.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.085
Unlimited vacations
sapby

37:50.130 --> 37:53.566
It's-it's cynicism disguised
as benevolence.

37:53.610 --> 37:54.611
And you know that.

37:54.660 --> 37:56.821
I know... H-How do I know that?

37:56.880 --> 37:59.007
Oh, give me
some credit.

37:59.050 --> 38:03.407
When companies offer
unlimited vacations,

38:03.450 --> 38:06.237
employees take
even less vacations.

38:06.280 --> 38:08.885
They're so paranoid
about pulling their own weight,

38:08.930 --> 38:10.886
they don't even use
their usual two weeks.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.158
That was not my intent.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.545
Well, then...
what is your intent?

38:18.550 --> 38:21.417
What are we talking about now?

38:21.470 --> 38:22.949
You're in my office.

38:22.990 --> 38:25.208
The door is closed.

38:25.250 --> 38:27.730
You still trying

38:27.780 --> 38:30.294
to "help" me?

38:30.350 --> 38:33.513
I'm not good at this.

38:33.570 --> 38:35.731
What is this?

38:35.790 --> 38:39.692
You're beautiful.

38:39.750 --> 38:42.002
And
I'm...

38:42.050 --> 38:45.440
Well, I have
my moments, but...

38:45.490 --> 38:48.493
My office is the size
of your bathroom.

38:48.540 --> 38:50.496
And I don't have...

38:50.540 --> 38:53.930
the money you have.

38:53.980 --> 38:56.448
[sighs]

38:59.460 --> 39:01.064
Come here.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.685
Okay.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.523
Well, I'm sorry
we won't be working together.

39:26.580 --> 39:29.538
Yeah. Thank you for your time.

39:29.580 --> 39:31.832
That was the last one.

39:31.890 --> 39:34.848
I thought Canning's clients
would be easier to pick off.

39:34.890 --> 39:37.324
What do we do?

39:37.370 --> 39:40.453
Mom?Yeah, Grace,
just give us a minute.

39:40.500 --> 39:43.412
No, actually, I think
you want to hear this.
I got four new clients.

39:43.460 --> 39:45.189
That's great, honey.
I'll be in in a few minutes.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.729
NCW. Justice Center.

39:46.770 --> 39:48.374
Preservation Basin.
And Jojo Lee's company.

39:52.910 --> 39:55.128
Excuse me?

40:03.050 --> 40:05.780
Excuse me?NCW.

40:05.830 --> 40:07.434
The Justice Center.
Preservation Basm.

40:07.490 --> 40:08.878
And Jojo Lee's company.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.832
I...

40:11.880 --> 40:14.838
You-you talked
to them?

40:14.890 --> 40:16.664
Yes.LUCCA:
NCW?

40:16.710 --> 40:19.178
Who did you talk to at NCW?

40:19.240 --> 40:22.880
Um, Bea Wilson.Bea Wilson?

40:22.940 --> 40:24.760
The Bea Wilson?

40:24.810 --> 40:25.845
[chuckles]
Well, a Bea Wilson.

40:25.900 --> 40:28.152
How did you get
all those firms?

40:28.200 --> 40:30.589
Apparently they're unhappy
with Diane Lockhart.

40:30.640 --> 40:34.167
So, can you make time
to meet with them?

40:34.210 --> 40:37.168
Y-Yeah. Yeah.DIANE:
The reason

40:37.210 --> 40:39.644
we haven't been able to produce
the medical records

40:39.690 --> 40:42.739
to substantiate our claim is
that we have been denied

40:42.780 --> 40:44.782
the minute-by-minute
procedure notes.You have no basis

40:44.830 --> 40:45.990
for discovery.It's a
catch-22,

40:46.050 --> 40:48.006
Your Honor. I need the evidence

40:48.050 --> 40:50.393
they have
to get the evidence they have.

40:50.440 --> 40:53.261
That is a problem, Ms. Lockhart.
For you.

40:53.320 --> 40:56.835
Well, you could fix it
with an evidentiary order.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.882
Let me think about that.

40:58.930 --> 41:00.625
No.

41:03.240 --> 41:07.062
Your Honor,
per Illinois rule 735

41:07.110 --> 41:12.764
ILCS 5/2-1001, I would like
to file a motion

41:12.810 --> 41:14.675
for substitution of judge.You're
asking me

41:14.730 --> 41:17.073
to remove myself from this case?Yes.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.769
On What grounds?Political bias.

41:18.820 --> 41:20.902
Motion denied. There is
nothing in the record

41:20.950 --> 41:22.679
to reflect any
bias on my part,

41:22.740 --> 41:25.083
political or
otherwise.There is nothing on the record

41:25.130 --> 41:26.779
because you pulled me
into chambers

41:26.830 --> 41:28.786
for an improper
ex parte conversation.

41:28.830 --> 41:29.694
You stop right there!Which revealed

41:29.740 --> 41:30.729
your bias
against both me

41:30.790 --> 41:32.951
and my clients' case.Denied!

41:33.010 --> 41:35.001
Again. Want to keep
getting knocked down?It is not fair

41:35.050 --> 41:37.484
that you, who are biased,
get to rule on your bias.It is fair.

41:37.530 --> 41:39.441
And you are way over the line.Your Honor,

41:39.490 --> 41:40.969
I am asking...Ms. Lockhart,

41:41.020 --> 41:43.966
I have made my ruling!

41:44.020 --> 41:46.454
You're welcome to proceed
with your case.

41:46.500 --> 41:49.583
And I assure you I will give it
all the consideration

41:49.630 --> 41:51.416
it deserves.

41:51.460 --> 41:54.452
[murmuring]

41:55.680 --> 41:58.376
I'm sorry. I tried

41:58.420 --> 42:01.594
my best, but I've just become
a liability.

42:01.640 --> 42:05.906
It's in your clients' best
interests for me to Withdraw.

42:05.950 --> 42:08.771
Nicely played.

42:08.830 --> 42:12.561
You found a way out Without
backing down from anyone. Kudos.

42:12.610 --> 42:15.397
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

42:15.440 --> 42:18.398
Okay. But it's time to
get our clients back.

42:18.440 --> 42:19.998
I'm on it.

42:20.050 --> 42:21.358
Here we go.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.879
We did it.

42:22.930 --> 42:25.182
Bravo.Jason, you're just
inﬁme

42:26.450 --> 42:27.929
For What?GRACE:

42:31.150 --> 42:33.015
Well, congratulations.

42:33.070 --> 42:34.970
Oh, Mom,
do you have a minute?

42:35.030 --> 42:37.988
Sure. Thanks
for all your help, Grace.

42:38.030 --> 42:39.281
No problem.

42:39.330 --> 42:43.073
Um, so it works
out to $35,800.

42:43.120 --> 42:44.371
For the year.

42:44.430 --> 42:45.818
What's that?

42:45.860 --> 42:48.078
A half percent of
the billable hours.

42:48.130 --> 42:50.121
That's what you owe me.

42:50.170 --> 42:52.513
Cash or
check is fine.
