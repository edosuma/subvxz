01:01.311 --> 01:05.022
No, man, I'm just saying'-- I'm sayin' if--
if you own the beach property, right...

01:05.105 --> 01:08.734
- Mm-hmm?
- Do you own, like, the sand and the water?

01:08.818 --> 01:12.571
Nobody owns the water.
God owns-- It's God's water.

01:12.655 --> 01:15.101
What if someone walks
onto your beach, right?

01:15.401 --> 01:16.784
Let's say if you do own it.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.786
No, man, you don't own the beach.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.829
- What you own is sand on the beach, man.
- Here. Here, man.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.041
What if there's a naked girl on the beach?

01:24.125 --> 01:26.043
That girl's not yours.
You don't own the girl.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.923
What if she breaks her
foot on your property?

01:28.023 --> 01:29.304
She could sue me.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.259
Sue me! Sue me!

01:34.344 --> 01:38.347
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Holy shit!

01:38.431 --> 01:40.474
Ditch it, man! Ditch it!

01:40.558 --> 01:43.143
- Dude, can you eat it?
- The whole bag?

01:43.937 --> 01:46.021
Fuck it!

01:48.525 --> 01:52.653
Hey, Mike, um,
while you're at it...

01:52.737 --> 01:56.073
- Those are 'shrooms, dude!
- Come on, man, just eat it!

02:00.370 --> 02:02.704
Mike, uh..

02:02.789 --> 02:06.125
- I hate to ask, but, uh... for the team?
- I can't eat that!

02:06.209 --> 02:08.627
- No! Throw it out the window!
- Okay! Okay! Okay!

02:08.711 --> 02:10.586
All right, I'm doin' a drop.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.714
- I'm goin' for a drop.
- Just opening the window.

02:14.008 --> 02:16.260
- It's gone. It's gone.
- We're cool. It's cool.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.428
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

02:18.513 --> 02:19.035
We're dead!

02:19.335 --> 02:21.849
All right, all right.
Windows down! Windows down!

02:21.933 --> 02:24.059
Windows down! Put the windows down!

02:28.523 --> 02:30.732
All right, we're cool.
We're cool.

02:38.032 --> 02:40.117
God, did you see that?

02:40.201 --> 02:44.163
It must have been, like, a double homicide
or something fuckin' cool.

02:44.247 --> 02:49.459
- We was freakin' out for nothing.
- Man, I almost had a heart attack.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.753
Mike, you didn't eat
both those bags, did you?

02:51.838 --> 02:55.549
Come and get it.

02:55.633 --> 03:00.304
You must have eaten, like,
a hundred bucks worth of pot...

03:00.388 --> 03:03.557
- and, like, 30 bucks worth of shrooms, man.
- Who's the man?

03:03.641 --> 03:08.437
So, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna need
130 buck, you know...

03:08.521 --> 03:10.689
whenever you get a chance.

03:10.773 --> 03:15.235
- Fuck, man.
- That-That's not really cool, man.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.615
Is that the same car, man?

03:19.699 --> 03:22.618
- D-Do I look high?
- Yeah.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.505
Here they--
Here they come.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.800
- Lick on it.Just lick it or somethin'.

Where you boys headed?

04:15.213 --> 04:17.839
Canada. We're goin'
over the border to Canada...

04:17.923 --> 04:20.968
- for some French fries and gravy, sir.
- Poutine.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.471
Canada, huh?
Almost made it.

04:26.557 --> 04:30.227
- Are you okay?

04:30.311 --> 04:32.271

04:32.355 --> 04:36.108

- I think he said, "Yeah, sure."

04:36.192 --> 04:38.610
- What'd you say, man?
- Well, I said, "Yeah, sure"...

04:38.695 --> 04:42.322
but what- literally, what
I said was, "Yeah, sure, sir."

04:42.407 --> 04:45.492
- So you are okay then?
- Yes, sir.

04:45.576 --> 04:50.038
- You smell somethin', Rabbit?
- Fear.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.457
Now hand over

04:52.542 --> 04:56.461
Yes, sir.
My mother's gonna kill me.

Holy shit. This is- This is- This is-
Don't look. Don't look.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.929
- Oh, my God.
- I don't get it, man.

05:06.014 --> 05:10.934
Am I fucked up or is this fucked up, man?

05:11.019 --> 05:13.061
This shit is fuckin' crazy.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.814
Shit, man. I was just
about to pull out my nine...

05:15.898 --> 05:17.816
and put a cap
in that pig's ass.

05:20.361 --> 05:23.780
Oh, fuck!

05:25.199 --> 05:28.535
Oh, my God!

05:48.429 --> 05:49.306
He's already pulled over!

05:49.390 --> 05:51.433
He can't pull over any farther!

05:54.562 --> 05:57.856
License and registration, please.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.485
- But I-I just gave you it, Officer.
- License and registration.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.655
You know how fast
you were goin'?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.574
- Uh, sixty-five?
- Sixty-three.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.786
I'm freakin' out, man.

06:10.870 --> 06:15.040
You are freakin' out, man.

06:15.124 --> 06:18.043
You want to know
why I pulled you over?

06:18.127 --> 06:22.547
- Littering.
- Officer, that-that's not ours.

06:22.632 --> 06:26.551

06:32.100 --> 06:35.560
Littering and, uh--

06:39.649 --> 06:43.402
Littering and smoking the reefer.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.655
Now to teach you boys a lesson,
Officer Rabbit and I are gonna stand here...

06:46.739 --> 06:50.325
- while you three smoke the whole bag.
- Please, no.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.702
- Please, yes--
- Fuckin' pig!

06:52.787 --> 06:55.330
Mother of God.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.048
Whoo!

07:08.511 --> 07:11.327
Radio, we're in high-speed
pursuit of a white Miata

07:11.627 --> 07:13.306
headin' southbound on Route 294.

07:13.391 --> 07:17.936
Unit 91, come in, 91
Unit 91, come in, 91.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.814
What are you doing out there, 91?
Quit counting your pubes.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.400
We got a hell-raiser
in a white Miata.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.902
Ninety-one, are you there?
Ninety-one?

07:25.987 --> 07:28.613
Ninety-one, are you there?

07:28.698 --> 07:32.075
Hey, good-lookin'.
You catch any speeders today?

07:41.002 --> 07:43.962
- Whoo!
- What the fuck!

07:45.673 --> 07:48.425
Let's go, 91.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.350
Rabbit, get that gun out!

08:41.895 --> 08:44.481
Aw, Mac, you fucker!

08:44.565 --> 08:47.609
Greetings.

08:47.693 --> 08:51.863
- You guys are too slow.
- You killed my dummy.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.784
Mac, now I'm gonna pay you. But I shouldn't,
'Cause I knew it was you the whole time.

08:55.868 --> 08:59.621
Thorny, don't lie in front of the rookie.
It sets a bad example.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.582
- Foster, where are your shoes?
- What, are you the shoe police now?

09:02.667 --> 09:05.126
I am, and you owe me
20 laps around the bar. Let's go.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.963
- Your black magic only works on the rookie.
- That's brown magic.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.341
- Pay up.
- When do I get to do that?

09:11.425 --> 09:13.552
You'll get your chance,
Rook. Shots?

09:13.636 --> 09:16.680
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of booze.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.808
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- I'm impressed.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.726
Jesus!

09:21.811 --> 09:24.020
Sorry, boys, you're on duty.

09:24.105 --> 09:27.190
- On your tab, Officer Womack?
- Rookie, pay the lady.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.192
- Pay her.
- Unit 23. Come in, 23.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.444
Unit 23. Come in, 23.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.281
Do you need me out there?
Do you need my assistance?

09:34.365 --> 09:36.324
- Shut up, Farva.
- I can be there--

09:36.409 --> 09:38.577
Listen, we got the Miata.
We're okay.

09:38.661 --> 09:43.415
What about those expert you picked up?
Do you need my assistance?

09:48.796 --> 09:53.008
The snozberries taste like snozberries.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.932
- Oh, shit!
- He killed the cops!

10:01.017 --> 10:03.518
- Get out of the car, man!
- This is a cop car!

10:03.603 --> 10:07.647
- Hello.
- You boys like Mexico?

10:07.732 --> 10:11.610
Yeeeee-hoooooo!

10:32.423 --> 10:36.760
One, two, three, do it!

10:36.844 --> 10:39.929
Oh, go, girlfriend
I'm your mother.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.317
Come on, Thorny. You're
losing to the rookie.

10:41.617 --> 10:42.098
It's embarrassing.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.267
Come on, Rabbit.
You can do it.

10:44.352 --> 10:48.188
Oh, Rabbit, he's killing you.
I got Thorny in front by a lot.

10:48.272 --> 10:50.357
What's the matter, your mama
didn't teach you how to chug?

10:50.441 --> 10:54.027
Come on, Thorn
Come on, Thorn.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.613
- Ohh!
- Goddamn it.

10:56.697 --> 11:00.200
I am all that is man.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.869
- Every time.
- Finish it up.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.840
See, there you have it.
You're doing it all wrong.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.461
Open your throat, relax the jaw.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.838
Don't forget to cup the ball
You're never gonna win...

11:13.923 --> 11:15.965
with those thin little
bird lips you got there.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.135
This guy's got these big old powerful lips.
Am I correct, Thorn?

11:19.220 --> 11:22.222
So much of my authority is
derived from the power right here.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.641
Hey, guys.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.398
Wow.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.153
- Uh, do you have any more syrup?
- Sorry, Urs.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.991
Why couldn't they chug ketchup?

11:42.076 --> 11:44.369
It's a good thing
you didn't order hash browns.

11:44.453 --> 11:47.622
I mean, if they had been
chugging the ketchup.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.501
You get the score of that
Red Sox game last night?

11:51.585 --> 11:55.463
- I turned it off just after--
- Ah, waiter. There you are.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.384
I will have the enchilada platter
with two tacos and no guacamole.

11:59.468 --> 12:03.346
- Smy?
- Yeah, Chief, I'll take a chinchilla.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.683
I don't get it. Tacos?

12:06.767 --> 12:08.852
They think I'm Mexican.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.104
You're not Mexican?

12:11.188 --> 12:13.857
Another highway cop?
What, are you guys multiplying?

12:13.941 --> 12:17.068
Yeah, if they can figure
which hole to stick it in.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.988
Ah, what the fuck?

12:20.072 --> 12:22.323
- Hey, I saw that!
- Sit down, Rando.

12:23.325 --> 12:26.745
That's it!

12:32.001 --> 12:34.085
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All right, all right!

12:34.170 --> 12:37.046
- Cut it out, you turkeys!
- He fuckin' started it!

12:39.675 --> 12:43.303
I'm sorry, Bruce. These boys
get that syrup in them...

12:43.387 --> 12:45.430
they get a little antsy
in their pantsy.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.432
You just can't
keep them under control.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.769
You should keep these dogs
on a leash, John.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.896

Sing it again, rookie bitch.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.629
Farva.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.465
- Forgot the coffee.
- My bad, Cap.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.885
All right, all right.
Let's get started.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.262
I got the latest
shit list, gentlemen.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.974
It's down to Flagstone
Deer Lick and us.

13:30.059 --> 13:33.394
And if we keep up these low numbers,
you can bet your sweet butts...

13:33.479 --> 13:36.022
we're gonna get the big, ugly ax.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.025
- Who'll bust heads on the highway?
- The goddamn local cops!

13:39.109 --> 13:41.694
And you better believe
that Grady and his goons...

13:41.779 --> 13:43.988
have got a copy of this list,
so we need to step it up.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.658
Who wants cream?

13:46.742 --> 13:50.203
Nobody? Okay, no cream.

13:50.287 --> 13:53.873
Foster, how many tickets
did you issue last week?

13:53.958 --> 13:57.544
Uh, I don't have my
figures here in front of me.

13:57.844 --> 13:58.503
Three.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.881

14:01.966 --> 14:03.915
And grow a goddamn
moustache, why don't ya?

14:04.215 --> 14:05.677
I haven't shaved in two weeks.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.388
- I'm growin' mine.
- Oh, you're growin' yours, are ya?

14:08.472 --> 14:10.629
I'll tell you when it's
time to grow a moustache.

14:10.929 --> 14:11.766
Coffee's served!

14:11.851 --> 14:14.352
Oh, no! That's Rabbit's.

14:14.436 --> 14:17.355

14:23.612 --> 14:27.323
- Look, fellas...
- Bite it, Rook. Make him look like a dick.

14:27.408 --> 14:31.870
Every Thursday night I walk
into the Lodge to play Hearts...

14:31.954 --> 14:35.123
and they always have my
Old-Fashioned just waiting there.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.709
- I like that.
- Bite it. Bite--

14:37.793 --> 14:40.503
Oh, hell!
Give me the goddamn soap!

14:42.256 --> 14:45.466
We got 50 miles of highway.
That stretch of highway is ours.

14:45.551 --> 14:49.262
I'll be damned if I'll let Grady
and those buttheads get their hands on it!

14:49.346 --> 14:51.806
Thorny, you're
the ranking officer here.

14:51.891 --> 14:56.895
Let's do your jobs and keep this place open,
huh? Let's do it. Farva!

14:56.979 --> 15:00.481
Your suspension continues.
Hit the radio.

15:01.817 --> 15:04.485
Oh, yes.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.196
Oh. Oh, local smokeys on our turf.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.909
All right, hit it.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.661
See, that's what O'Hagan
was talking about.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.581
Hi. You guys forget
what color your car is?

15:18.292 --> 15:21.252
- Bye-bye.
- Later, dude.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.296
All right,
how about "Cat Game"?

15:23.380 --> 15:26.758
- Cat Game? What's, uh, what's the record?
- Thorny did six...

15:26.842 --> 15:29.344
- but I think you can do ten.
- Ten?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.721
Starting right meow?

15:35.309 --> 15:37.852
- Uh, sorry about that.
- All right, meow...

15:37.937 --> 15:40.063
hand over your license
and registration.

15:44.485 --> 15:48.279
- Your registration? Hurry up meow.
- Oh.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.365
Sorry.

15:50.449 --> 15:54.077
There somethin' funny here, boy?

15:54.161 --> 15:55.995
No, no, no.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.958
Well, then, why you laughing,
Mr. Larry Johnson?

16:02.044 --> 16:06.005
- All right meow, where were we?
- Are you saying "meow"?

16:06.090 --> 16:09.133
Am I saying "meow"?

16:09.218 --> 16:11.803
- I-I-I thought--
- Don't think, boy.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.889
Meow, do you know how fast you were going?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.141
Meow, what is so damn funny?

16:17.226 --> 16:19.018
I could have sworn
you said "meow."

16:19.103 --> 16:22.981
Do I look like a cat to you, boy?

16:23.065 --> 16:25.942
Am I jumping around all
nimbly-bimbly from tree to tree?

16:26.026 --> 16:28.736
- No. No.
- Am I drinkin' milk from a saucer?

16:28.821 --> 16:32.031
- No.
- Do you see me eatin' mice?

16:32.116 --> 16:35.034
Now you stop laughin' right meow.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.578
Yes, sir.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.331
Meow, I'm gonna have to
give you a ticket on this one.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.376
- But--
- No "buts" meow. That's the law.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.796
It's not so funny meow, is it?

16:50.926 --> 16:52.927
Meow!

17:01.770 --> 17:04.814
Ooo-wee-ooh!

17:04.897 --> 17:07.275
Thanks for washing my car, Rook.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.612
- You know what this is?
- A chamois cloth?

17:11.696 --> 17:15.116
Ha! Luck guess.
I just lost a buck...

17:16.702 --> 17:18.786
to myself.

17:23.166 --> 17:26.586
- Think that's funny, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.589
Also heard something funny
about how you got suspended.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.592
Something about
a school bus full of kids?

17:32.676 --> 17:37.388
Oh, you heard that, did ya? Let me
tell you another funny story, New Jack.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.390
Back in '74...

17:39.475 --> 17:42.435
the great Charlie Rich was
named Country Musician of the Year.

17:42.519 --> 17:45.730
Then in '75, he had to hand
the award off to the new one.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.899
And you know who that was?

17:47.983 --> 17:51.736
Mr. "Sunshine on My Goddamn Shoulders,"
John Denver.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.863
- Really?
- Yeah. Can you believe it?

17:53.947 --> 17:56.240
- Wow!
- Replaced by John Fuckin' Denver.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.576
- Amazing.
- Yeah.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.746
Well, I'll be damaged if Mr. Rich
didn't pull out his cigarette lighter...

18:01.830 --> 18:04.499
and light that award on fire
in front of everyone.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.002
Do you get it?

18:08.087 --> 18:12.381
So you're saying you'll set
my Country Music Award on fire?

18:12.466 --> 18:16.177
I'm saying when my suspension's up,
you better watch your ass.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.055
Or you’ll light my ass on fire?

18:26.438 --> 18:29.857
- You wanna go? You wanna take one?
- Make your first move.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.569
Hey! I hate to break up the honk convention,
but we got a 10-92.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.738
- You wanna take this one, Rod?
- Hell, yeah!

18:35.823 --> 18:38.866
I bet you do-- Ohh!

18:41.203 --> 18:43.287
Nice wax-job, Rook.

18:43.372 --> 18:47.291
- Thank you, sir.
- You--

18:50.754 --> 18:53.089
What the hell is this?
We got local pigs runnin' around?

18:53.173 --> 18:56.509
How'd the locals beat us here?
We're, like, ten miles out.

18:56.593 --> 19:00.221
- Look at this chump.
- Oh, Mr. Tough Guy here.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.265
Take a walk, bud
take a walk.

19:02.349 --> 19:06.853
Holy shit!
It's a cool Winnebago.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.552
My Uncle Denny used to
have one just like this.

19:09.852 --> 19:11.649
Rabbit, put your game face on.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.818
You got it, boss.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.196
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Oh-oh!

19:17.281 --> 19:20.616
Oh, yes.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.204
- Oh, man! What happened here?
- Take a walk, sonny.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.893
This investigation is
already under control.

19:28.193 --> 19:29.292
Well, now it is.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.378
- Hey!
- Don't touch the crime scene, rodent!

19:32.462 --> 19:38.009
Rabbit. Hey, look at that.
Johnny Chimpo.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.970
- Quit slappin' me.
- Would you stop touching my rookie, Grady?

19:41.054 --> 19:43.347
Hey, I'll touch you.

19:47.019 --> 19:51.272
This is the Spurbury Police.
Put your hands up and come outta there!

19:58.530 --> 20:02.241
Get the fuck out of here!

20:05.787 --> 20:09.290
- Glamor pet. No dice Get your tape.
- Okay. Let's cruise.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.004
- Sounds like y'all have a hog problem.
- Oh, watch it, Mac.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.006
Mac, I'm serious.
Be careful, Mac. He's angry.

20:17.090 --> 20:21.928
- He's angry? Well, hello.
- Hey, mark it off.

20:22.012 --> 20:25.681
- Smy, you mark it off.
- Back it up, Grady. I'm serious.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.351
What's the point? Didn't you guys
get shut down already?

20:28.435 --> 20:30.978
Oh, yeah, that's next week.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.485
Your bust. You know there's
a dead chick in there?

20:37.569 --> 20:39.487
Move it, Ramashit!

20:39.571 --> 20:43.366
- Take it up with O'Hagan!
- Fight, fight, fight!

20:45.994 --> 20:48.621
- Ow! My arm!
- Mac!

20:53.085 --> 20:56.671
Get off of me!
Get off!

21:04.513 --> 21:08.015
I'll give you the fat guy
for Foster and, uh...

21:08.100 --> 21:10.601
how about that
stupid guy for Rabbit?

21:10.686 --> 21:12.937
Well, you're gonna
have to be more specific.

21:13.021 --> 21:15.314
They're both kinda fat and stupid.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.859
Get these damn handcuffs
off now, Ramathorn!

21:18.944 --> 21:22.280
- Cut him loose.
- Go ahead, Smy.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.783
You want to tell me what bug
crawled up your big ass, Grady?

21:25.867 --> 21:28.676
Yeah, I will tell you.
This is our crime scene.

21:28.976 --> 21:29.912
We are takin' it.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.165
- It's highway. It's our jurisdiction.
- No. No.

21:33.250 --> 21:37.169
This highway is closed.
This is our jurisdiction.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.758
Aw, fuck it.
You deal with the hog.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.643
Hey, Chief.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.604
What in hell's
gotten into you guys?

21:55.689 --> 21:58.774
I told you to be good.
I told you this was a bad time.

21:58.859 --> 22:02.820
But you go ahead and get into a battle
royale with the locals at a crime scene.

22:02.904 --> 22:06.490
- But they started that fight.
- Of course they started the fight!

22:06.575 --> 22:09.744
Now they've taken
a jurisdictional grievance against us.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.038
They want us to blow i

22:12.122 --> 22:15.833
I mean,
a murder on the highway...

22:15.917 --> 22:18.377
and you give them
the investigation.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.172
Christ! We look like
a bunch of pussies.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.637
All right,
come on out, Rabbit.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.143
I guess I just go
take a shower then, huh?

22:36.438 --> 22:38.356
Ow!

22:43.070 --> 22:45.863
Strike three!
You're out of there!

22:45.947 --> 22:48.491
All right, good cut, Ritchie.
Good cut. Come on.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.702
Next batter! Batter up!
Next batter! Let's go.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.706
But, Thorn,
if they do shut you down...

22:55.791 --> 22:57.792
maybe you could
Stick around here?

22:57.876 --> 22:59.835
I don't know,
get a different job?

22:59.920 --> 23:02.213
You can always
come work in my shop.

23:02.297 --> 23:06.236
Yeah, retired cop goes to work
for his hippie girlfriend...

23:06.536 --> 23:08.177
in her head shop.
Too sitcom.

23:08.261 --> 23:12.348
Okay. You better pay
attention, Coach. Our son's up.

23:12.432 --> 23:14.350
All right, Arlo.
Watch the ball. Get a hit.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.560
You got it.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.731
- Let's do it.
- All right, Arlo.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.201
Whoa!

23:32.285 --> 23:35.996
- Hey, you gotta keep on your toes.
- Do somethin' about that, ref.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.499
Sorry-ass local cops.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.709
You think you have a nice
relationship with someone...

23:40.794 --> 23:43.546
based on professional courtesy
and mutual boredom.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.006
The next thing you know,
they're trying to take you out.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.134
What? What?

23:48.218 --> 23:50.761
I don't wanna get transferred.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.092
Have to go be a rookie again
with a bunch of random dudes.

23:53.392 --> 23:54.306
Don't worry about it.

23:54.391 --> 23:58.253
If it happens, we'll, uh,
we'll all just stay here,

23:58.553 --> 24:00.187
open up a roller disco.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.691
Throw him the heat.
Bring it on.

24:03.775 --> 24:06.986
Uh, anybody want a corn dog?

24:07.070 --> 24:10.072
See if they got any
chocolate bananas. Foster?

24:12.451 --> 24:14.785
Ohh!

24:19.332 --> 24:21.250
Hey, Charlie's Angel.

24:21.334 --> 24:26.130
Hey, congratulations. You're the one
millionth person to say that to me.

24:26.214 --> 24:30.301
- Oh. What do I win?
- Ooh. Um...

24:30.385 --> 24:32.470
Ahh. There you go.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.472
Hope I don't get brain freeze.

24:34.556 --> 24:37.475
I'm not sure you've
got the required equipment.

24:37.559 --> 24:41.228
So, listen, I, um, had a really good
time at that Winnebago fight.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.273
Maybe, uh, I don't know,
we could do it again sometime.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.152
All right, all right.
Fair is fair.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.196
You can slug me back
if you want to.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.073
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.784
Hold my snow cone.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.706
- Okay.
- Heads up!

25:00.790 --> 25:04.335
Hey, what happened over there?

25:04.419 --> 25:09.131
What? Wh- Why?

25:09.216 --> 25:11.634
How about a little pep, hmm?

25:18.808 --> 25:20.809
From those guys over there.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.522
Assholes.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.107
You want to move that,
buddy. Now!

25:27.192 --> 25:28.361
So, about my field time.

25:28.661 --> 25:31.195
Yeah, yeah. I've been
thinkin' a lot about that.

25:31.279 --> 25:33.697
I think I might be able
to talk to Grady for you.

25:33.782 --> 25:38.077
- Pink stick, eat it or lose it.
- Hey, shut your pie hole, buddy.

25:38.161 --> 25:40.704
I mean, because I'm ready
to go out on patrol.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.760
I'm goin' nuts being on
the radio all the time.

25:43.060 --> 25:44.333
I'd like to get some field work.

25:44.417 --> 25:48.754
Yeah? Why don't you take your radio
and go stand in a field.

25:48.838 --> 25:51.882
Move that gigantic
cotton candy!

25:51.967 --> 25:54.843
Goddamn it! How's the view
from sugar heaven, bitch?

26:03.436 --> 26:06.605
Hi. I'm looking for Chief Grady.
I have some files for him.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.024
Grady's not here.
I'll take the file.

26:09.109 --> 26:12.973
It's kind of important.
How about Officer Rando?

26:13.273 --> 26:13.904
Nope.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.864
What do you need?
I'm the only one here?

26:15.949 --> 26:19.368
There are no
male officers around?

26:19.452 --> 26:22.746
Just give me the file.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.790
What's this?

26:24.874 --> 26:28.919
So you originally
from Vermont or, uh, or what?

26:32.591 --> 26:35.843
You know, you've got a lot of courage
walkin' into the lion's den.

26:35.927 --> 26:39.179
- Oh, I got brass buns.
- Mm. You should join the band.

26:41.308 --> 26:44.393
What are your cells,
eight by eight?

26:44.477 --> 26:47.187
Ours are nine by nine.
No big deal.

26:47.272 --> 26:53.152
Listen, you seem like a really nice guy,
but I just don't date cops.

26:53.236 --> 26:54.817
I'm not much of a cop, really.

26:55.117 --> 26:57.489
More like a civilian
trapped in a cop's body.

26:57.574 --> 27:00.409
Oh. Well, I hear you can
get an operation for that.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.302
But then,
I guess you'd miss out...

27:02.352 --> 27:04.663
on all those wack things
you highway guys do.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.166
Yeah, those stories about us
are mostly lies, really.

27:07.250 --> 27:10.586
Except for the one about how
we pulled over AC/DC's bus...

27:10.670 --> 27:13.797
and then they flew us down to Jamaica
to party with them; that one's true.

27:13.882 --> 27:17.676
But, yeah, other than that
it's pretty boring out there.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.762
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't know.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.017
All right, it's probably time
for you to get out of here.

27:25.101 --> 27:28.312
- I don't want to get fired too.
- Oh, I'm not getting fired.

27:28.396 --> 27:32.274
I'm gettin' shut down.
That's a big difference.

27:33.693 --> 27:37.821
- In our cells, the door is over here.
- Right.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.701
A couple of hyenas.

27:42.786 --> 27:46.580
Well, you know,
they are speeding.

27:46.665 --> 27:50.209
- Come in, Radio.
- Don't call me Radio, Unit 91.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.920
Then don't call me Unit 91, Radio.

27:53.004 --> 27:56.298
- Are you done?
- Yeah, okay, Radio.

27:56.383 --> 27:59.635
We got a suspicious vehicle.
White Caprice, Vermont plates.

27:59.719 --> 28:02.805
Tijuana-Gringo-Oner-Fiver-Zero.

28:02.889 --> 28:06.100
- Roger. Checking.
- Thank you, Radio.

28:08.812 --> 28:13.816
Unit 91, that license plate belongs
to a local Spurbury police vehicle.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.443
It does? Oh, my God!

28:16.528 --> 28:20.781
- Very funny, 91.
- Thank you, Radio.

28:22.909 --> 28:26.328
Whoa! Looks like that truck's planning on
skipping the weigh-in.

28:26.413 --> 28:29.540
Yeah, well, you don't weigh in,
you don't wrestle.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.793
Whoa! What's this jack-off doin'
trying to pull him over?

28:32.877 --> 28:36.255
There's no fuckin' way
that is happenin'.

28:36.339 --> 28:38.882
- What the hell's he doin'?
- I got somethin'.

28:41.010 --> 28:44.972
Yeah. That's right, doofu.
Move it along.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.936
You, uh, wanna do "Repeat"?

28:51.020 --> 28:53.105
Do you wanna do "Repeat"?

28:53.189 --> 28:57.609
No. I've been thinking a lot
about what the Captain said.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.960
I'd like to play it
straight this time, okay?

29:00.260 --> 29:00.654
Okay.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.073
- For O'Hagan.
- For O'Hagan.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.287
Good morning.

29:08.371 --> 29:10.748
Would you mind stepping down from there
with your license and registration?

29:10.832 --> 29:13.083
- Sure. I was just--
- Good morning.

29:13.168 --> 29:16.712
Would you mind stepping down from there
with your license and registration?

29:16.796 --> 29:21.925
- Yeah. No problem.
- Excuse me one second. No.

29:22.010 --> 29:25.679
Excuse me one second.
No.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.307
Did, uh, I do something
wrong, officers...

29:28.391 --> 29:30.893
because I know
I wasn't speeding.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.024
- Why didn't you weigh in?
- Yeah, why didn't you weigh in?

29:37.108 --> 29:39.276
Did I miss that weigh station?

29:39.360 --> 29:41.403
They got me runnin'
so many miles...

29:41.488 --> 29:43.405
I Just must have
dazed out and well--

29:43.490 --> 29:45.491
I'll pull into the next one
and get weighed, okay?

29:45.575 --> 29:47.785
What are you pulling back there?

29:47.869 --> 29:49.828
Well, uh,
mostly just soap, I think.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.872
Why don't we take a look?

29:51.956 --> 29:54.750
Listen, Officers, I'm on a really
tight schedule. I really need to--

29:54.834 --> 29:57.461
Let's go, Mr. Galikanokus.

29:57.545 --> 30:01.715
Well, you heard him.
Let's go, Mr...

30:01.800 --> 30:06.136
Mr. Galonukum.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.934
Hop on up.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.978
Okay-silly-dilly-dokey-o.
I'm an idiot.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.064
Yeah, that's true.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.651
Sorry about the light there.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.529
I have a flashlight in the cab.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.739
- Hey! Mr. Galikanokus!
- Whoa!

30:25.824 --> 30:27.866
Mr. Galikanokus!

30:29.577 --> 30:31.995
- We should have seen that comin'.
- We should have seen that comin'.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.749
- It is time to stop now, Mac.
- It is...

30:36.626 --> 30:38.919
time to stop now, Mac?

30:41.798 --> 30:44.341
And that was
the second time I got crapped.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.343
- Awesome.
- Afternoon.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.345
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.685
It stinks like sex in here.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.187
What happened?

30:57.272 --> 31:00.315
We got a little distracted by
somebody doin' the "Repeater."

31:00.400 --> 31:03.610
- Huh. That'll happen.
- That will happen.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.612
Well, you did it this time.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.166
Fishin' your car out of
Lake Leblanc right now.

31:08.466 --> 31:09.032
Oh, man.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.243
Nah, we just parked it across the street.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.956
All right, listen. Next time
this kind of thing happens...

31:16.040 --> 31:18.584
I want you to stop,
take a deep breath...

31:18.668 --> 31:20.797
and pull your heads out of
each other's asses, would ya?

31:21.097 --> 31:21.545
Language.

31:21.629 --> 31:24.047
It's easy for you to say.
He's got a tiny little head.

31:24.132 --> 31:27.342
Yeah. What's this guy movin'?

31:27.427 --> 31:29.428
Soap, I think.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.315
Reefer.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.569
Whoo-hoo!
That's one stinky pyramid.

31:45.653 --> 31:49.239
We should've built
a stinky igloo and climb in.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.124
That's a lot of pot.

31:50.424 --> 31:52.743
Thinkin' back to your tour
days with the Dead, Rabbit?

31:52.827 --> 31:57.331
- Better lock this shit up, huh, buddy?
- What are you talkin' about?

31:58.416 --> 32:00.709
Enhance.

32:00.793 --> 32:04.922
Enhance. Enhance.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.090
Just print the damn thing!

32:07.175 --> 32:11.219
All right, what do we know
about this Galikanokus guy?

32:11.304 --> 32:13.597
It's a fake name,
fake license.

32:13.681 --> 32:15.807
- Bunty Soap?
- Fake soap company.

32:15.892 --> 32:19.770
- What, plastic fake? Decorative fake? What?
- No, like they don't exist.

32:19.854 --> 32:23.732
So, we got 150 kilos of
marijuana and no arrests. We got nothin'.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.734
I got a theory, Cap.

32:25.818 --> 32:30.072
These, uh, bales of pot, they have that
red Johnny Chimpo sticker on them.

32:30.156 --> 32:33.408
And that dead woman in the Winnebago
had the same logo tattooed on her back.

32:33.493 --> 32:38.580
See, a lot of drug dealers use stickers
to mark their products. Like a brand name.

32:38.665 --> 32:42.250
See! Where'd you learn that,
Cheech? Drug school?

32:42.335 --> 32:44.836
Shut up, Farva.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.089
Did that bag you pulled off those
college kids have that sticker?

32:47.173 --> 32:49.925
Um...

32:50.009 --> 32:53.345
I don't believe it did.

32:53.429 --> 32:56.640
- Was there any marijuana on that Winnebago?
- Nope.

32:56.724 --> 33:01.561
A monkey tattoo.
Sounds kinda flimsy.

33:01.646 --> 33:05.941
What's the significance
of this John Chimpo fella?

33:06.025 --> 33:10.070
Uh, well, you know those really
cheap Japanese Cartoons?

33:11.406 --> 33:16.159
No? This is basically
a cheaper Afghani knockoff.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.996
It's this monkey that basically
travels around the world...

33:19.080 --> 33:20.998
uh, doing nasty things.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.667
His butler tries to keep him
in line, but, uh-- No.

33:23.751 --> 33:26.294
It's really funny, Cap.
It's Afghanistanimation.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.340
The monkey has a butler?
Great.

33:30.425 --> 33:33.510
- Is that what they do in Arabia, Thorny?
- How the hell should I know?

33:33.594 --> 33:38.473
All right. Somebody get me
a VTR copy of this thing.

33:38.558 --> 33:41.018
I'll talk to Grady, see if he'll let
us take a look at the Winnebago.

33:41.102 --> 33:44.187
All right. You ready for the photo shoot?
Okay, fellas, let's take it.

33:47.608 --> 33:51.862
- Pull down your pants.
- Shut up, Farva, you idiot. Come on, do it.

33:51.946 --> 33:54.990
- John. I'm not interrupting, am I?
- Mayor Timber!

33:55.074 --> 33:59.828
- No. Come in, come in.
- Good work, gentlemen, all the way around.

33:59.912 --> 34:03.915
- Could I get in on that?
- Sure. Why not?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.668
- Excuse me. Good work. Good work, Officer.
- Hey.

34:06.753 --> 34:09.170
You're gonna have a hard time shutting
us down now, right, Mr. Mayor?

34:09.255 --> 34:11.882
We got a murder one day,
a drug bust the next.

34:11.966 --> 34:15.635
I'm thinkin' we need
as much police as we can get.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.679
- That'd be a good slogan, wouldn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.473
Tell that
to the budget committee.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.850
I Just got off the phone
with Governor Jessman...

34:21.934 --> 34:24.770
and she's gonna be swinging through here
on her way to Burlington.

34:24.853 --> 34:28.690
Give me a gun, huh,
to hold for the pictures.

34:28.775 --> 34:32.152
- Rabbit, run. Gun.
- And, John...

34:32.235 --> 34:34.737
as far as this brawling with
the local police is concerned--

34:34.822 --> 34:37.157
It won't happen again, Bill.
I'm onto it.

34:37.241 --> 34:39.242
Good.

34:39.327 --> 34:43.371
'Cause when the governor shows up,
I'm gonna throw her a little party.

34:45.373 --> 34:50.170
We're gonna let her know just how this
community feels about its law enforcement.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.172
Spread it on!

34:55.885 --> 34:58.261
Come on, Dad!
Faster! Faster!

34:58.346 --> 35:01.098
- So what's the deal with you and Bobbi?
- Come on, Dad!

35:01.182 --> 35:04.935
You guys are goin' out, but you,
um, sleep with other people?

35:05.019 --> 35:09.356
Well, I mean, yeah.
Not really. Kind of.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.067
It's sort of a long story,
all right?

35:12.151 --> 35:17.280
Well- Hey, Arlo, does Mom
ever have any friends over?

35:17.365 --> 35:20.075
- Any older boys?
- Can't we turn the siren on?

35:20.159 --> 35:22.202
In a minute, all right?
Are you listening?

35:22.286 --> 35:24.951
Does she have anyone over
that maybe you call uncle?

35:25.251 --> 35:26.206
Like Uncle Fred?

35:26.290 --> 35:28.208
Uncle Fred?
Who's Uncle Fred?

35:28.292 --> 35:31.795
He's this crazy bird on TV.

35:31.879 --> 35:35.006
- He's crazy. He flies around like a pigeon.
- Oh, right.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.634
Uncle Freddy, he's great.
He's a crazy bird.

35:37.718 --> 35:39.678
Okay.

35:39.762 --> 35:42.055
We got one.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.641
You wanna
take this one, kid?

35:44.725 --> 35:47.561
- What about you?
- I gotta stay with little "A."

35:48.729 --> 35:50.647
- You're okay, right?
- Sure.

35:50.731 --> 35:53.608
- Go on. Make mama proud.
- All right.

35:53.693 --> 35:58.697
Yeah, Farva, I got a Porsche,
brown, Washington plates--

35:58.781 --> 36:02.742
- Eight-Donna-Peanut-Eunuch.
- Roger. Checking.

36:07.039 --> 36:11.918
Kill it.

36:12.003 --> 36:15.714
Can I please see your license
and registra--

36:15.798 --> 36:19.426
I'm sorry, Office
for the speeding violation.

36:19.510 --> 36:22.304
I am so used to driving
on the Autobahn.

36:22.388 --> 36:25.390
Uh-- what?

36:25.474 --> 36:27.559
...Sean Cassidy.

36:27.643 --> 36:30.770
Yummy, yummy.

36:33.816 --> 36:36.484
Nicht?

36:36.569 --> 36:40.989
- Do you know why I pulled you over?
- We were driving way too fast.

36:41.073 --> 36:42.991
- Ja.
- Ja.

36:43.075 --> 36:45.118
Officer, this is a major problem...

36:45.203 --> 36:48.538
because I cannot afford another
ticket with mein Porsche.

36:48.623 --> 36:53.418
Is there maybe something I can do for you,
hmm? Or maybe my wife...

36:53.502 --> 36:56.671
Could do for you
to avoid this dilemma?

36:56.756 --> 37:01.092
Is there maybe something
you would like me to do to you?

37:01.177 --> 37:05.138
Or maybe something you would
like to do to me? Hmm?

37:05.223 --> 37:09.017
Uh, 'cause you were
doing 90 in a 65.

37:09.101 --> 37:12.771
Perhaps some spanking
or cuffing is in order.

37:12.855 --> 37:17.359
Could you hold on a minute?
Just a minute. I'll be right back.

37:38.005 --> 37:42.550
- Twenty-three, that Porsche is hot.
- Are you sure?

37:51.978 --> 37:53.937
Rabbit?

37:54.021 --> 37:57.357
- Please, Thorn, not now. No.
- He can join too, if you like?

37:57.441 --> 37:59.776
- Get over here.
- Tickle, tickle.

37:59.860 --> 38:03.697
- Ja.
- Hold on a second.Just one second, huh?

38:06.367 --> 38:09.744
- What?
- Farva said that car is stolen.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.746
What? Stolen?

38:11.831 --> 38:14.082
- Shit!
- Is there a problem, officers?

38:14.166 --> 38:17.919
Hold on! Come on, Thorn,
I need this.

38:18.004 --> 38:21.006
Look, kid, any other day, I'd step
in here and show you how to swing.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.425
But the car's stolen.

38:23.509 --> 38:25.760
Goddamn it!

38:25.845 --> 38:28.138
You got to get over there
and you got to cuff her.

38:28.222 --> 38:31.349
Do it! You're a highway patrolman.

38:31.434 --> 38:34.477
Cut it out! Do it.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.480
Now turn that off
and step out of the car, sir.

38:37.565 --> 38:42.193
- This is no problem, hmm?
- Put your hands on the car and spread 'em.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.529
- Ah, now some fun for both of us.
- Get back in the car!

38:44.613 --> 38:48.575
Rabbit, get over
there and cuff her.

38:48.659 --> 38:49.471
Up against the car.

38:49.771 --> 38:51.995
Ma'am, I hate to do this
to you, but would you--

38:52.079 --> 38:54.184
Would you please put
your hands behind your back?

38:54.484 --> 38:55.832
Now things are getting kinky.

38:55.916 --> 38:58.209
Arlo!

38:58.294 --> 39:01.171
- I love your--
- I'm on the radio. Come in, Farva.

39:01.255 --> 39:06.092
Arlo! Rabbit! Let's go!

39:07.511 --> 39:09.429
Climb up on Uncle Rabbit's
lap, Arlo, okay?

39:09.513 --> 39:11.360
I don't think that's
such a good idea, Thorn.

39:11.660 --> 39:12.182
Uh, right.

39:12.266 --> 39:14.768
Okay, why don't you Just
sit in the middle, buddy?

39:19.857 --> 39:22.650
Ursula, what the fuck?
There's no T.P. in the bathroom.

39:22.735 --> 39:27.155
- What about the piece stuck to your shoe?
- What about that piece?

39:27.239 --> 39:29.324
Shit!

39:29.408 --> 39:32.994
You know, you might get ahead around here
if you made the extra effort.

39:33.079 --> 39:36.706
- Do you want me to wipe your ass?
- That's not what I--

39:36.791 --> 39:41.419
Well, around my house,
my wife knows to refill the T.P.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.849
I'm not your wife, Smy.

39:43.149 --> 39:46.424
No. And if you were,
I'd take you down a peg or two.

39:46.509 --> 39:49.052
Ooh.

39:49.136 --> 39:51.221
Hi, douche bag.

39:53.599 --> 39:56.351
You know, if you were my wife..

39:56.435 --> 39:58.853
I'd massage your feet every
night until you fell asleep.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.689
Nice try.

40:01.774 --> 40:04.359
He strangles her
and puts her face in pig food?

40:04.443 --> 40:08.488
What an asshole.
Got any I.D. on the corpse?

40:08.572 --> 40:11.491
Yeah. "Jane Doe."
Do you know her?

40:11.575 --> 40:14.577
Oh, we're working on it.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.871
It's called routine police work.

40:16.956 --> 40:20.250
Apparently, she had a cartoon monkey
tattooed on her back.

40:20.334 --> 40:22.836
John Chimpo, I'm told.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.260
And those cannabis bags
in our truck...

40:30.344 --> 40:32.637
those stickers had
the same monkey logo.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.931
So we think there might be
some kind of connection.

40:35.015 --> 40:40.395
Are you suggesting that a cartoon monkey
is bringing drugs into our town?

40:40.479 --> 40:44.023
- Look, I know we don't like each other.
- I like you.

40:44.108 --> 40:47.485
Come on! I'm looking
for a little cooperation here.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.405
John Chimpo.

40:50.489 --> 40:54.534
Hanson, could you round up,
uh, Johnny Chimpo...

40:54.618 --> 40:57.213
and, uh, Jerry Giraffe
and Arty the Alligator...

40:57.513 --> 40:59.205
and bring them in for a lineup.

40:59.290 --> 41:03.668
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Sounds like they're having fun.

41:03.752 --> 41:06.171
That's what happens when you start
hanging out with a state trooper.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.756
We show you the funny.

41:08.841 --> 41:11.384
Well, where were we?

41:11.469 --> 41:14.929
Uh, you were laying your best rap
on me and I was resisting.

41:15.014 --> 41:17.223
But you were starting to think about it.

41:17.308 --> 41:21.561
- I told you. I don't touch highway hog.
- Baby, I'm Sizzle Lean.

41:21.645 --> 41:24.564
I scratched your back, Bruce.
I scratched it good and hard.

41:24.648 --> 41:28.776
Now, either you scratch my back or you’re
gonna get my size ten boot up your ass!

41:28.861 --> 41:32.864
Desperation is a stink cologne, John.

41:32.948 --> 41:38.703
Let's see. You are an expendable
line item on a state spending bill.

41:38.787 --> 41:41.206
You have a station full
of crappy cops.

41:41.290 --> 41:45.001
I am about this far away
from having a bigger budget.

41:45.085 --> 41:50.006
And now, you come in here
talking about...

41:50.090 --> 41:54.928
monkey tattoos on some drunk lady's tit
like it's a goddamn drug conspiracy.

41:56.847 --> 42:02.352
Keep your bags packed, John.
Let us handle the real police work, huh?

42:02.436 --> 42:06.189
Uh, John, when you do get shut down
you come back, talk to me.

42:06.273 --> 42:08.358
I can always use
a good meter maid.

42:20.579 --> 42:22.497
Let it roll.

43:09.128 --> 43:11.254
Come and get me, Mac.

43:47.625 --> 43:51.878
- See you later, sucker!
- Ohh! Ohh! Fuck!

43:53.589 --> 43:56.424
Can't catch the Rabbit.

44:06.935 --> 44:12.023
- Damn it!
- Out of the car! Out of the car, scumbag!

44:12.107 --> 44:14.609
Well, hello, Shirley.

44:14.693 --> 44:17.737
Come on, Farva, man. Same team. Same team.

44:17.821 --> 44:19.781
What's Thorny
going to say, Rook?

44:19.865 --> 44:22.575
Honestly, Bobbi
I think it's gonna happen.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.036
We don't want to leave
We really like this town.

44:25.120 --> 44:29.332
I'll probably just get sent down
to Brattleboro. It's a nice town.

44:29.416 --> 44:31.959
I don't think it's
a healthy time for him to move.

44:32.044 --> 44:34.337
He's got a lot of real good friends here.

44:34.421 --> 44:37.423
Who? That creepy kid with the lisp?

44:37.508 --> 44:40.093
Hey. Stop jumping on the bed.

44:40.177 --> 44:43.304
Look, I don't want to go
without you.

44:43.389 --> 44:47.100
- Then you should stay here.
- But I can't if they transfer me.

44:47.184 --> 44:50.061
Hey, stop jumping
on the bed.

44:50.145 --> 44:53.064
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

44:53.148 --> 44:56.192
Hey, honey, it's almost
Mitternacht, huh?

44:56.276 --> 45:00.196
Uhh. We really should
be getting back to the jail.

45:00.280 --> 45:06.202
You don't want us turning into pumpkins.

45:06.286 --> 45:08.871
Thorn, can't they just
stay a little longer?

45:08.956 --> 45:12.709
All right.
Who wants a mustache ride?

45:12.793 --> 45:17.463
- I want one. I want one!
- I do! I do! I do!

45:20.968 --> 45:21.691
Spurbury Police.

45:21.991 --> 45:24.429
Oh, thank the Lord.
Thank the Lord. It's terrible.

45:24.513 --> 45:26.681
Oh, there's a disgusting
pervert flashing people.

45:26.765 --> 45:28.683
Ma'am, I need you
to calm down.

45:28.767 --> 45:31.394
I can't calm down!
You calm down! Oh, my God!

45:31.478 --> 45:35.189
- Ma'am, tell me your location.
- He's right in front of the building...

45:35.274 --> 45:38.735
on 323, uh, Karuna Street.

45:38.819 --> 45:41.904
- That's this address, ma'am.
- Oh, well, then, maybe you can see him.

45:41.989 --> 45:44.991
He's right in front of the building.
Go look. I'll hold.

45:46.285 --> 45:48.953
Whoo-aaah!

45:49.037 --> 45:51.414
Did you see him?
Oh, he's disgusting.

45:51.498 --> 45:53.030
He certainly is, ma'am.

45:53.330 --> 45:56.461
Oh, I think he's going
to the window again.

45:56.545 --> 45:59.046
Whoo-ooo-ooo!

45:59.131 --> 46:03.926
Oh, the humanity!
He's so bulgy. He's like a moose.

46:04.011 --> 46:06.554
Oh, no!
I think he's going back again.

46:09.099 --> 46:11.559
Freeze, motherfucker!

46:11.643 --> 46:14.937
Oh, God! Please don't shoot me.
I-I'm naked.

46:15.022 --> 46:18.107
Drop your coat and grab your toes.

46:18.192 --> 46:18.496
What?

46:18.796 --> 46:21.778
I'm gonna show you
where the wild goose goes.

46:21.862 --> 46:26.532
Oh, this isn't happening.
I-I-I'm a police officer. Ursula, help!

46:26.617 --> 46:29.869
Baby, I'm gonna butter your bread.

46:34.166 --> 46:37.043
You don't have these at your station?

46:38.921 --> 46:42.757
I don't suppose you got a pair
of fresh underwear I could borrow?

46:42.841 --> 46:45.510
I'm not sure you could
fit into my panties.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.811
You know, you can't
tell anybody about this.

46:54.895 --> 46:57.563
I already told my mom about you.

47:07.115 --> 47:10.409
Ohh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

47:12.371 --> 47:16.082
- Shit!
- Baby, you rocked me.

47:23.382 --> 47:26.425
Wow! What is this?

47:28.804 --> 47:30.166
Rabbit, you're off
the road! Shut up, Farva!

47:30.466 --> 47:31.222
It's a good move, Cap.

47:31.306 --> 47:34.141
Rabbit, you're on radio.
Farva, you're ridin' with Thorny.

47:34.226 --> 47:36.936
- Wait a minute--
- What do you want me to do about it?

47:37.020 --> 47:39.272
My hands are tied!
It's all over the police band!

47:39.356 --> 47:41.607
Rabbit, you couldn't
have picked a worst time!

47:41.692 --> 47:44.610
I got a Q-17 request form today.

47:44.695 --> 47:47.029
We have to inventory
our equipment.

47:47.114 --> 47:50.783
Which means our balls are
this close to the band saw.

47:52.744 --> 47:55.204
What are you sellin', Mac,
hot dogs?

47:55.289 --> 47:57.999
- There's a new billboard.
- Casino le Fantastique?

47:58.083 --> 48:00.626
Let me guess.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.296
You just humped the mayor's wife
and burnt down City Hall.

48:03.380 --> 48:05.882
I'll do you one better, Captain.

48:05.966 --> 48:08.770
So I'm walkin' down by
the local police station,

48:09.070 --> 48:10.386
minding my own business.

48:10.470 --> 48:12.889
But there's something
funny in the air.

48:12.973 --> 48:15.975
I feel like I just gotta
get into that Winnebago.

48:16.059 --> 48:18.644
So after I jimmy the
door, I do a quick recon.

48:18.944 --> 48:19.604
Bullshit.

48:19.688 --> 48:22.899
I can see there's something
not right about that bed.

48:22.983 --> 48:25.192
- So I busted it in.
- Bullshit.

48:25.277 --> 48:29.447
And just sittin' there were ten
huge duffel bags of these mothers.

48:29.531 --> 48:34.076
Let me get this straight. You went into
the impound, scaled the fence...

48:34.161 --> 48:39.582
broke into the Winnebago and smashed
the bed, all on a hunch?

48:39.666 --> 48:43.502
I'll believe that when me shit turns
purple and smells like rainbow sherbet.

48:43.587 --> 48:46.589
What? Do you think
I just grew this weed?

48:46.673 --> 48:49.467
How could you know
to look underneath the bed?

48:49.551 --> 48:52.720
It must have been my sixth--
or even my seventh sense.

48:52.804 --> 48:55.806
You know, Rabbit, a good cop doesn't
really know why he does anything.

48:55.891 --> 48:57.109
Disregard that, Rabbit.

48:57.409 --> 49:00.269
And you didn't even think
to call in your partner?

49:00.354 --> 49:04.565
So these local mothers have got a hundred
keys of chiba and don't know it?

49:04.650 --> 49:07.068
Not a clue.
It's totally hidden.

49:07.152 --> 49:09.785
And Grady's walkin'
around like he's hot soup.

49:10.085 --> 49:11.822
All right,
we got a chance here.

49:11.907 --> 49:14.033
But we got to beat
these guys to the punch.

49:14.117 --> 49:16.911
Mac, you and Foster
check out the truck stops...

49:16.995 --> 49:20.498
and find out what you can
about Galikanokus and Bunty Soap.

49:20.582 --> 49:23.249
I'll talk to Grady and
play a little hardball.

49:23.549 --> 49:25.252
Thorny, I'm takin' a hard line.

49:25.337 --> 49:27.546
You got to promise me
no more bullshit.

49:27.631 --> 49:31.425
Cap, you know I'm cool, but I can take
no responsibility for these white devils.

49:31.510 --> 49:33.344
Well, you're gonna have to.

49:33.428 --> 49:37.723
Now, Rodney, we're under
a lot of pressure here.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.559
Remember what we talked about.
If anything happens...

49:40.644 --> 49:43.479
count to ten,
take some deep breaths.

49:43.563 --> 49:45.523
Ten deep breaths.
I got it, Cap.

49:45.607 --> 49:48.818
Foster, you're on duty.

49:48.902 --> 49:51.070
Trust me, skipper,
we'll make you proud.

49:53.657 --> 49:56.909
You are awesome.

49:56.994 --> 50:00.677
You are incredible.
You are a fantastic cop.

50:00.977 --> 50:02.123
Keep goin'.

50:02.207 --> 50:05.126
Uh, and then somebody said,
I think it was O'Hagan, said, um...

50:05.210 --> 50:10.506
- "Foster, you deserve a promotion."
- Hmm. I think you get a star.

50:13.635 --> 50:18.014
Mm. Foster? Wait.
I don't know if this is gonna work.

50:18.098 --> 50:21.517
- This steering wheel is jabbing my ass.
- Oh, right.

50:35.490 --> 50:37.408
Ow! Okay.

50:37.492 --> 50:40.661
In New York City, a guy could pay ten bucks
to watch two cops have sex in a cage.

50:40.746 --> 50:42.830
Yeah?

50:45.083 --> 50:47.334
Oh.

50:47.419 --> 50:50.004
- Foster?
- Yeah?

50:50.088 --> 50:53.674
In our cruisers, somebody has to let you out
of the back seat.

50:56.303 --> 50:58.304
Oh, fuck it!

51:04.061 --> 51:07.313
Do we look like the two dumbest guys
in the world to you?

51:07.397 --> 51:09.982
Is that why you choose to treat us
with such disrespect?

51:10.067 --> 51:13.235
Look, all I'm sayin', man,
is switch partners. It'll be fun.

51:13.320 --> 51:16.739
- I don't think so.
- Come on, mix it up a bit.

51:16.823 --> 51:18.741
Mm, no fuckin' way.

51:18.825 --> 51:23.120
Come on, Mac, you know you’re always sayin'
how funny Foster smells.

51:23.205 --> 51:26.225
Oh, look out for Thorny,
master of psychology.

51:26.525 --> 51:27.875
Do I really smell?

51:27.959 --> 51:31.670
All right, assholes,
quit talkin' about me.

51:31.755 --> 51:34.298
Lock and load, Ramathorn.
Let's kick some tail.

51:34.382 --> 51:37.043
We weren't talkin'
about you, you big idiot.

51:37.343 --> 51:38.052
Bullshit.

51:38.136 --> 51:40.638
- Truck stop, huh?
- We gotta do it.

51:40.722 --> 51:43.099
But the captain didn't say anything
about going undercover.

51:43.183 --> 51:46.102
Do you think they're gonna tell us anything
if they know we're cops?

51:46.186 --> 51:48.947
Get a job, man! Look,
you're fuckin' super cop.

51:49.247 --> 51:50.397
You should know this.

51:50.482 --> 51:53.400
- I am super.
- Plus, we can't take our car...

51:53.485 --> 51:56.617
until they replace the door you,
for no reason whatsoever, ...

51:56.917 --> 51:57.613
removed last night.

51:57.697 --> 52:00.324
I told you it was those kids
with the wrenches.

52:00.408 --> 52:03.285
Ah, yes, those ballsy little punks
who took your car door off...

52:03.370 --> 52:05.371
while you were sittin'
in the damn thing.

52:05.455 --> 52:07.456
I told you I was in a very deep sleep.

52:07.541 --> 52:11.627
Yeah. You wanna tell that to O'Hagan?
Maybe we can borrow his car today.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.966
Do you even know
how to drive this thing?

52:36.403 --> 52:38.445
Shit! This rig sucks!

52:38.530 --> 52:40.447
Aha!

52:48.081 --> 52:50.583
Uh, who knew it was a stick?

53:01.720 --> 53:05.139
How about we, uh,
pop a couple of Viagra...

53:05.223 --> 53:09.310
and issue tickets
with raging, mega-huge boners?

53:09.394 --> 53:12.313
Only you, Farva,
can make a dark man blush.

53:13.815 --> 53:17.193
- And, no, we're not doin' it.
- Ah, hell.

53:17.277 --> 53:19.751
Hey, I came up with a
great name for our car.

53:20.051 --> 53:20.696
Oh, yeah?

53:20.780 --> 53:25.034
Get this.
You're Arcot Ramathorn-- Ram--

53:25.118 --> 53:29.663
and I'm Rod Farva- Rod;
car Ramrod.

53:29.748 --> 53:32.082
Car Ramrod. You get it?

53:32.167 --> 53:35.753
Yeah, I got it.

53:35.837 --> 53:38.339
- Rabbit, I got a Plymouth Voyager...
- Say "Car Ramrod."

53:38.423 --> 53:40.925
- Say "Car Ramrod."
- Vermont plates- Hold on.

53:41.009 --> 53:43.010
Vermont plates- Alpha...

53:43.094 --> 53:47.264
God-Mustard-One-Niner-Decade-China.

53:47.349 --> 53:49.391
Check it.
Roger, 23.

53:49.476 --> 53:51.610
You didn't say it.
I wrote it on the paper.

53:51.910 --> 53:52.686
Oh, I forgot.

53:52.771 --> 53:53.281
Oh, yeah.

53:53.581 --> 53:56.357
Come on, Ramathorn,
what game are we playin'?

53:56.441 --> 53:58.817
- What? No games.
- Don't bullshit me.

53:58.902 --> 54:02.905
Let's play one of those games I keep hearin'
about. You know, Mac and Foster...

54:02.989 --> 54:05.908
did that thing, you know,
with the "who can say pussy the most."

54:05.992 --> 54:10.579
You know, actually, Mac bet Foster
he couldn't say "meow" ten times.

54:12.540 --> 54:15.876
To the driver.

54:15.961 --> 54:17.862
I realize that doesn't
sound funny as I described--

54:18.162 --> 54:19.296
Who can say "meow" the most?

54:19.381 --> 54:22.299
You guys are real crazy.

54:22.384 --> 54:24.385
Hey, look out for these guys!

54:25.637 --> 54:29.014
Hell, I can say "meow."
I can say "moo."

54:29.099 --> 54:33.394
For 20 bucks, I'll call the guy
a chicken-fucker.

54:33.478 --> 54:37.731
Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod.
Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod.

54:37.816 --> 54:42.861
License and registration...
chicken-fucker! Brawwk!

54:46.199 --> 54:48.534
- Bruce? John O'Hagan.
- John!

54:48.618 --> 54:52.413
I'm glad you called. Listen. I have
Bobby the Baboon in lockup...

54:52.497 --> 54:55.291
and he says that for twenty bananas
he'll provide evidence...

54:55.375 --> 55:00.129
Johnny Chimpo is the pimp in charge
of the Cartoon Network whorehouse.

55:00.213 --> 55:03.299
Look, I'm done dickin' around.
We got new evidence on your murder.

55:03.383 --> 55:06.135
Who? Galikanokus?
You know where he is?

55:06.219 --> 55:08.762
No, we don't know where he is, but--

55:08.847 --> 55:10.973
Then I don't see how you can
possibly help us, then.

55:11.057 --> 55:14.476
Okay. This is my last offer.

55:14.561 --> 55:16.478
Either you let us in
on this investigation...

55:16.563 --> 55:18.731
or I'm gonna
embarrass you personally.

55:18.815 --> 55:20.774
Oh, how embarrassed?

55:20.859 --> 55:23.152
Like, naked in a dream
embarrassed?

55:23.236 --> 55:25.138
No, no.
Embarrassed like back in '77,

55:25.438 --> 55:27.990
when you got caught fuckin'
your cousin embarrassed.

55:29.451 --> 55:32.995
She's not my cousin.

55:37.751 --> 55:40.044
Welcome to Dimpus.
Can I take your order?

55:40.128 --> 55:42.171
Give me a, uh,
double bacon cheeseburger.

55:43.506 --> 55:47.051
Double bacon cheeseburger.
It's for a cop.

55:47.135 --> 55:49.094
- Roger.
- What the hell's that all about?

55:49.179 --> 55:50.415
He gonna spit in it now?

55:50.715 --> 55:53.599
No, I was just tellin'
him that so he makes it good.

55:53.683 --> 55:56.685
Don't spit in
that cop's burger.

55:56.770 --> 55:59.146
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Roger. Hold the spit.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.983
Give me a, uh, pie.
Apple.

56:03.068 --> 56:05.110
Do you want me
to hold the spit?

56:05.195 --> 56:07.196
Just kidding,
Officer... Farva.

56:07.280 --> 56:10.908
So, do you want to "Dimpisize" your meal
for a quarter more?

56:10.992 --> 56:13.160
Want me to "punchisize"
your face for free?

56:13.244 --> 56:17.414
Some male figure? I'm his dad.
And stop with the whole transfer thing.

56:17.499 --> 56:19.458
Oh, Christ.

56:19.542 --> 56:21.877
You know what? I gotta go.
Let's talk about this later, okay?

56:21.961 --> 56:24.588
Okay. bye.

56:24.672 --> 56:26.058
Now don't give me any lip.

56:26.358 --> 56:29.343
It’s just a quarter, and
look how much more you get.

56:29.427 --> 56:32.304
- I said no!
- It’s just 25 cents.

56:32.389 --> 56:35.682
- Hey, listen, guy. He doesn't want it.
- I can handle this, Ramathorn.

56:35.767 --> 56:38.811
- I don't want it!
- Right. Uh, beverage?

56:40.271 --> 56:42.648
Gimme a, uh, liter of cola.

56:42.732 --> 56:45.067
- A what?
- A liter of cola!

56:46.736 --> 56:49.655
"Leederacola."
Do we make leederacola?

56:49.739 --> 56:51.865
Will you just order
a large, Farva?

56:51.950 --> 56:55.285
I don't want a large Farva.
I want a goddamn liter of cola!

56:55.370 --> 56:58.372
- I don't know what that is!
- Liter is French...

56:58.456 --> 57:02.251
for "give me some fuckin' cola
before I break both fuckin' lips."

57:02.335 --> 57:04.837
All right, all right.
Relax!

57:07.507 --> 57:11.051
- That look like spit to you?
- Yeah.

57:11.136 --> 57:13.053
Ah, fuck it.

57:14.431 --> 57:17.433
Mm. I feel like
a real cop again.

57:17.517 --> 57:21.061
Well, I wouldn't get used to it,
'Cause you know it's not gonna last.

57:21.146 --> 57:24.606
- Bullshit. I'm not goin' anywhere.
- All right, buddy.

57:24.691 --> 57:26.650
We're about to get
shut down anyway.

57:26.734 --> 57:30.154
Oh, yeah?
That's a lot of"Dimp."

57:30.238 --> 57:33.407
- What do you do if you get transferred?
- I don't know.

57:33.491 --> 57:35.284
Bobbi doesn't want
to leave, and...

57:35.368 --> 57:37.286
I don't want to leave
her and Arlo, so--

57:37.370 --> 57:39.288
Yeah, I don't know
what the hell I'm gonna do.

57:39.372 --> 57:42.458
Who gives a shit? I'm about to win
ten million bucks anyway, right?

57:42.542 --> 57:44.460
Are ya? What are you going to do
with that ten million bucks?

57:44.544 --> 57:47.254
And you can't say,
"Buy the Cleveland Cavaliers."

57:47.338 --> 57:49.798
- I'd buy a ten-million-dollar car.
- Ah, good investment.

57:49.883 --> 57:52.634
- But I'd pull you over.
- Bullshit. You could never catch me.

57:52.719 --> 57:54.318
Oh, I could never catch you?

57:54.618 --> 57:57.931
If you did, I'd activate
my Car's wings, and fly away.

57:58.016 --> 58:00.767
I got a good feelin' about this.

58:02.228 --> 58:04.646
Damn it, you burger punk!

58:04.731 --> 58:07.900
You son of a bitch!

58:07.984 --> 58:12.696
Aah!

58:23.291 --> 58:25.125
Yeah, Burger Boy!

58:29.631 --> 58:31.882
All right, all right, all right.

58:31.966 --> 58:33.800
Cut it out, you guys.
Knock it off.

58:35.136 --> 58:37.095
Clear out of here.
All of you.

58:40.016 --> 58:44.311
I was hittin' his ass so hard
with that hose.

58:45.813 --> 58:49.274
I'm sorry about
the delousing, Rod.

58:49.359 --> 58:52.152
Standard procedure.

58:52.237 --> 58:56.156
- It's powdered sugar.
- The lice hate the sugar.

58:56.241 --> 58:59.034
- Listen, Rod--
- It's delicious.

58:59.118 --> 59:02.079
Uh, good. Good.

59:02.163 --> 59:05.582
Say, Rod, what are your plans
after the shutdown?

59:05.667 --> 59:09.044
We're not gettin' shut down,
Grady. We're drug busters.

59:09.128 --> 59:12.756
Maybe they're drug busters,
but you're dispatch.

59:12.840 --> 59:16.510
- Nuh-uh. I'm back on the road, now.
- Until this little incident.

59:16.594 --> 59:19.555
Listen, Rod...

59:19.639 --> 59:24.560
This whole murder thing, we've been
tryin' real hard to break it open...

59:24.644 --> 59:28.814
but O'Hagan just will not
cooperate with the evidence.

59:28.898 --> 59:30.816
Now I've spoken to
the governor myself.

59:30.900 --> 59:34.236
She is gonna shut your station down, son.
It's gonna happen.

59:34.320 --> 59:37.489
Now, I'm gonna have a bigger budget then,
and I could really use...

59:37.574 --> 59:41.618
a good local officer
like yourself.

59:41.703 --> 59:44.705
- Could I go now?
- You could have your own car.

59:44.789 --> 59:49.418
Work on exciting cases. Hey, we could
even chase drug dealers together.

59:49.502 --> 59:51.878
Now, the thing is, Rod...

59:51.963 --> 59:54.756
I really need to know about
your side of the investigation.

59:54.841 --> 59:59.469
O'Hagan's making all kinds
of threats, and-

59:59.554 --> 01:00:01.555
Can we make a deal?

01:00:03.808 --> 01:00:05.726
I'm all highway.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.362
Let him loose.

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:21.867
Sorry about that, bro.

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:36.214
Hey, Charlie's Angel.

01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:49.394
- What's up?
- Guys.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.647
Hey.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.690
Well, we got about, uh,
twenty desk lamps.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:58.195
- Farva went schizoid.
- That's good.

01:00:58.279 --> 01:01:01.406
- How did the undercover thing go?
- Well, not so good.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.534
- Turns out, this guy can't drive a semi.
- Yeah.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:06.912
You guys watch
that Johnny Chimpo thing?

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:11.208
- Funny, but nothin' there.
- Mm. Maybe you missed something.

01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:15.045
Mm, trust me, bro.
There's nothing there.

01:01:15.129 --> 01:01:18.006
Maybe we should
take another look.

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:52.259
That's it, you're off
the road. Never again.

01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:53.041
Sir, no.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:55.544
- It was not my fault.
- Neither was the goddamn school bus.

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:58.714
You know, there was a time we'd take a guy
like you out back and beat you.

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:02.008
- Now you got your goddamn unions.
- I'm not a pro-union guy.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:06.805
- And you're banned from Dimpus Burger.
- Damn it!

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:10.142
Get some rubber gloves. From now on
you're my cleaning lady.

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:13.520
Beat it!

01:02:13.604 --> 01:02:17.524
Well, the butler is basically
saying to Johannes Chimpo...

01:02:17.608 --> 01:02:21.319
"Don't let the Great Satan tempt
you with the Western culture.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:25.282
You must remain true
to the Taliban warlord."

01:02:25.366 --> 01:02:27.951
Cool beans.

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:37.169
So, um, Galikanokus
is not the butler?

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:41.548
Well, possibly. But this is,
uh, quite brilliant, really.

01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:46.094
And so, Captain, you think there might
be some connection with the smugglers?

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:49.431
Rabbit, get this meatball
out of here.

01:02:49.515 --> 01:02:51.433
You got it, Captain
Come on, meatball.

01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:53.518
We should probably do that.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:58.482
Back in the cage with
your beautiful wife, huh?

01:02:58.566 --> 01:03:01.203
What did you find out
at the weigh station?

01:03:01.503 --> 01:03:03.361
My cruiser weighs 16,000 kg.

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:08.784
I just got off the phone with Tom McCardle
from the budget committee.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:10.911
- This thing with Farva screwed our pooch.
- What?

01:03:10.995 --> 01:03:13.497
They can't lump us in
with that fuckin' Martian.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:17.459
- We're all in the same boat.
- But our shenanigans are cheek and fun.

01:03:17.543 --> 01:03:21.338
Yeah. His shenanigans
are cruel and tragic.

01:03:21.422 --> 01:03:24.525
Which makes them not
shenanigans at all, really.

01:03:24.825 --> 01:03:26.092
Evil shenanigans.

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:29.888
I swear to God I'll pistol-whip
the next guy that says, "shenanigans."

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:33.183
Hey, Farva!

01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:36.770
What's the name of that restaurant you like
with all the goofy shit on the walls...

01:03:36.854 --> 01:03:40.106
- and the mozzarella sticks?
- You mean shenanigans?

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:42.651
- No! Oh!
- You're talking about shenanigans, right?

01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:45.195
Put those away!

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:49.968
Hey, Rabbit.

01:03:50.268 --> 01:03:54.663
Yeah, I know. "You got
beautiful, big brown lips."

01:03:54.747 --> 01:03:57.207
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:59.960
Have your fun, boys.
Have your fun.

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:03.129
'Cause I'm gonna start
looking for a new job.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:18.562
Hey! Urs! Ha!

01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:23.525
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:26.695
The mayor came down today.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:32.534
Ah, biker! I'm an idiot.

01:04:32.618 --> 01:04:36.580
Boy, you guys just keep
shooting yourselves in the foot.

01:04:36.664 --> 01:04:40.083
- Heard you got to see Farva naked.
- Yeah, it was hard to miss.

01:04:41.627 --> 01:04:43.879
So, Grady thinks he's
got you guys by the balls.

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:46.923
Yeah. How do you feel about
long-distance relationships?

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:48.925
Think I'm getting
sent to Deer Lick.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.927
Well, I've been
thinking about this.

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.722
I think
I might have an idea.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.934
The governor comes to town on
Saturday for that big thing, right?

01:04:58.019 --> 01:05:00.562
She's gonna make a big speech
about drugs and law enforcement...

01:05:00.646 --> 01:05:04.566
- and all of that because of your bust.
- She's gonna shut us down.

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:07.235
No! Not if you give her more.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:11.656
Get the reefer out of the Winnebago
and give it to her during the party.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:12.844
Make a big show of it.

01:05:13.144 --> 01:05:15.952
With all that media there,
she would love us for it.

01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:19.623
- No way she'll shut you down.
- That reefer's locked in the Winnebago...

01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:23.418
which is locked in your impound,
which is guarded by assholes.

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:28.965
All right.
Here's what I'll need.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.718
Five ski masks, a case
of smoke bombs-- the good ones--

01:05:31.802 --> 01:05:35.055
- and banana peels, lots of banana--
- Foster?

01:05:35.139 --> 01:05:39.225
- How about if I just help you get in?
- You would do that for me?

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.729
Yeah. What the hell.
We'll work together.

01:05:42.813 --> 01:05:45.315
Like Cagney and Lacey.

01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:47.317
Yeah. Well, Cagney
and Lacey were women.

01:05:47.401 --> 01:05:50.028
- But--
- I could be Lacey.

01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:01.414
Mac-o!

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:06.294
- So that's it, huh?
- C.C.S. Rockman Bulletproofing is the tops!

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:09.130
Same guys who make
our flak-jackets.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.800
Now, Rabbit,
a good cop does what...

01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:14.219
before using his equipment
in the field?

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:18.640
- Uh, they test it?
- They test it. Exactly.

01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:20.725
How are you shootin'
today, Thorn?

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:26.481
- Dead on all morning.
- How about that little fella?

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:29.401
Oh, that little guy? I wouldn't
worry about that little guy.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:31.778
Good enough for me.
You're my man, now.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:38.576
I don't get it. How are we going to get
into the local impound?

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.578
There are gonna be cops there.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.331
Wa-hoo!

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:46.334
Most of the local cops will probably
already be at the banquet.

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:49.671
They'll leave, like, one or two
of the dumbest guys at the station.

01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:55.010
- How are you feelin' there, Mac?
- Good enough to fuck your mother!

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:57.887
So, what we have to do
is distract whoever they leave there.

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:01.057
Hey, Mac! You still have
that Halloween costume?

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:03.351
Oh, hell, yeah.
You don't throw out--

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.270
Wa-hoo-hoo!

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:09.149
Damn, that's good!

01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:12.318
So, if we can get ten minutes,
you and I can get into the impound...

01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:14.904
get the reefer, and get it to the governor
before she leaves?

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:16.948
- Nice and easy.
- I like it.

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.201
- You're up.
- Me?

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.203
- Now, don't get puke on it.
- Does it hurt?

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:24.372
You're gonna feel a little pinch.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.875
Lookin' good, Rabbit!
Now don't move!

01:07:26.959 --> 01:07:29.419
- Hang on, buddy.
- Hey, Cap!

01:07:29.503 --> 01:07:33.131
- Hey, Captain.
- Bulletproof cup, huh?

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:36.801
I invented this gag, Rabbit.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:40.096
- Only in my day, the rookie got naked.
- Who, whoa, whoa!

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:48.646
And we also used blanks.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.857
You're a sick motherfucker, Mac.

01:07:50.941 --> 01:07:52.070
Thanks, Chief.

01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:56.321
All right, Thorny.
Why'd you call me up here?

01:08:02.703 --> 01:08:06.289
Good to know you’re still battin'
for us with the budget committee Mayor.

01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:09.167
Well, I don't want to mince words, John,
but it doesn't look too good.

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:11.586
Maybe not to the untrained eye.

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:15.965
But if I was a bettin' man, I'd put money on
us changin' the governor's mind tonight.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:20.804
Well, you might want to strap on your
ass-kissing boots and start right now.

01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:23.515
- I think she's your only hope.
- Hello.

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.683
What is this thing again?
Humane society?

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:29.187
- Uh, it's a drug bust.
- Cocaine?

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:32.649
- Hello.
- Uh, marijuana.

01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:33.819
Then why are we here?

01:08:34.118 --> 01:08:36.861
Oh, I think we're pretty
well covered, Mr. Mayor.

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:39.029
I think she's got
a lot of decisions to make.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.241
- I don't envy her.
- Oh, I do.

01:08:41.325 --> 01:08:43.535
I'll be luck to have a figure
like that when I'm her age.

01:08:43.618 --> 01:08:47.162
Yeah. That's a good one.

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:51.760
We're sending someone
down, don't worry. Okay.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:52.877
Thanks You bet.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.712
- No, no, no, no. We'll bring the guns.
- We're on it. We're on it.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:59.175
We got it. All right,
that's like twenty calls.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.636
I'll tell you what. I'll go down there
and check it out.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.140
- What about me?
- Burton, somebody's got to stay here.

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:09.227
All right, fuck it.

01:09:27.078 --> 01:09:29.663
Shit!

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:31.707
Maybe this is the key.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.545
I mean, no offense, bro, but...

01:09:35.629 --> 01:09:37.546
When did you become a cop?

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:40.341
None taken, Ramathorn.
None taken.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:43.595
- Really. How'd you know the key was there?
- A gentleman never asks.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:47.724
A lady never tells.
Wonder how Rabbit's doin'?

01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:50.225
Oh, yeah!

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:54.355
- Yeah! Yeah!
- What does that look like to you?

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:59.277
Is the bear--

01:10:00.654 --> 01:10:04.365
- Is the guy--
- Oh, yeah. Yeah!

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.618
Seems more of
a game warden thing to me.

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:09.787
- Well, it's illegal, Burton. I know that!
- Whoo! Oh!

01:10:18.797 --> 01:10:20.715
Oh, shit. Look who's here.

01:10:20.799 --> 01:10:22.427
I thought you said
he wasn't gonna make it.

01:10:22.727 --> 01:10:23.134
I tried.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.221
- Glad to see you, Rodney.
- Hey, how are you doin', Rowdy?

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:28.345
How you think I'm
doin'? Open bar, ain't it?

01:10:28.645 --> 01:10:29.098
Mm-hmm.

01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:32.727
- Thought you said Bowl-a-rama.
- Yeah, I tried to call you, but, um--

01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:35.230
Yeah, right!

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:37.273
- Give me six schlitzes.
- No schlitz.

01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:40.735
- Whatever's free.
- Take it easy, Rod.

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:43.196
Open bar, dude!

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:50.954
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:58.253
Hello down there.
Are you okay?

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.841
Excuse me.

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:08.263
- Bear- Bear-fucker!
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:11.766
- Do you need assistance?
- Oh! Oh! Oh, yeah.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:16.187
Okay.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.189
Let's do this.

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:23.528
Hey, hey, whoa! Whoa!

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:29.742
Mayor Timber, yeah. So I just
wanted to let you know...

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:32.203
that the governor's gonna
have to leave early.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.956
For an emergency fund-raiser.
So--

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.292
Aw, she's gonna speak
in about five minutes.

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.794
And then we're gonna
have to zip on out of here.

01:11:39.878 --> 01:11:42.547
- Well, thanks for the heads-up.
- I'll go check on those guys.

01:11:45.592 --> 01:11:49.470
Mac-Attack! Wanna go punch for punch?

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:52.974
Good one!
I did not specify.

01:11:53.058 --> 01:11:56.644
Never shit a shitter.
Lady in blue, comin' through.

01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:00.606
Ramathorn.

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:03.901

What's Grady doin' up there?

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:08.966
...and of course, your own local
police chief, Bruce Grady...

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:12.720
has made yet another
astonishing breakthrough..

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:16.724
in our state's War on Drugs.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:20.812
That's fine police work.

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.523
Thank you very much.
The real credit...

01:13:23.607 --> 01:13:27.485
goes to my skilled officers, who uncovered
the marijuana in that Winnebago.

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:31.656
And, uh, we have identified
the dead woman from that Winnebago...

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:36.869
as a drug "queenpin"
from Louisville, Kentucky- Lucy Garfield.

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:40.019
Or, as we like to call
her down at the station,

01:13:40.319 --> 01:13:41.916
"The Louisville Smuggler."

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:46.838
There will be no more
running of marijuana..

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:48.840
through Spurbury
on my watch.

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:51.342
You can count on that.

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:02.937
Farva's number one!
Farva's number one!

01:14:03.021 --> 01:14:08.067
Hey! You showed Grady our secret stash?
That was our stash!

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:09.986
- I did not show Grady the stash!
- Those bags of grass...

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:11.821
- represented a-a bond of trust between us.
- Foster--

01:14:11.905 --> 01:14:12.951
Foster, I had no idea--

01:14:13.251 --> 01:14:15.616
Did you pick me because
you could manipulate me?

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.911
No! How could you
even say that?

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:22.081
- Because you crapped on my heart!
- I what on your heart?

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:25.376
What are you gettin' out of this?
Is Grady puttin' you on the road?

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:29.839
No, a-are you--
You're screwing him too.

01:14:29.923 --> 01:14:32.049
- Asshole.
- Aah!

01:14:39.516 --> 01:14:44.812
Ursula-

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:47.440
- Oh, Mac.
- What the fuck?

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:50.401
Fuckin' traitor!

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:55.406
Hey, Mac! Did it work?
Did it work?

01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:05.625
Was there ever a moment
when you suspected her?

01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:07.960
- No, why would I?
- Exactly.

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:10.880
Why use your head when you can be
getting some cop-on-cop fucky-sucky?

01:15:10.964 --> 01:15:13.299
Well, did you
tell her anything?

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:15.301
Two cops sleeping together. What the hell
do you think they talked about?

01:15:15.385 --> 01:15:17.178
I don't know. Doin' it?
Positions and stuff?

01:15:17.262 --> 01:15:19.472
Oh, shut up.
You guys don't even know her.

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:20.983
Get it through your head,
fish dick. She was in on it.

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:21.724
Fuck you, Mac!

01:15:21.808 --> 01:15:24.810
All right, all right. Fighting's
not gonna change anything.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:28.356
Foster, she played you good. It's called
the honey pot. You should have known better.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.485
Well, I guess they were gonna
shut us down anyway.

01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:36.197
But you two are friends, you know?
You shouldn't let this come between you.

01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:38.449
Come on now.
Shake hands.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.451
- Sorry.
- You should be.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:44.664
- Hey!
- Sorry. - Sorry.

01:15:44.748 --> 01:15:47.875
- Good, now. Who wants a shot?
- I do.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.211
- I'll have one.
- I said, who wants a shot?

01:15:50.295 --> 01:15:50.555
I do!

01:15:50.855 --> 01:15:53.297
Do you have any
openings in Sherburne, Cap?

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:56.008
- Not for you guys.
- Oh, come on.

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:59.053
- We're like the sons you never had.
- If you were my son, Mac...

01:15:59.137 --> 01:16:01.055
I would have
smothered you by now.

01:16:01.139 --> 01:16:04.642
Smothered me in gravy,
you big, dirty man.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.727
- You put in for a transfer yet?
- Ugh!

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:10.022
I applied for a guard job.
At the post office.

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:12.775
- Oh, man.
- You'll finally get to shoot someone.

01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:21.826
- To the death of fun.
- Here's to you guys.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.001
What's up, dirty dogs?

01:16:31.044 --> 01:16:33.629
Guess that's it for
the old locker.

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:36.173
She stinks like ass,
but I'll sure miss her.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:38.259
I guess you can say that
about all my girls.

01:16:38.343 --> 01:16:42.054
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck to you too.

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:46.183
- What are you?
- I'm a cop. What are you?

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:49.186
- A local cop?
- Grady had an opening. Big deal.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:52.106
Why are you wearing that
uniform in my station?

01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:54.400
Look who's talkin', Denim Dan!

01:16:54.484 --> 01:16:58.195
You look like the president,
chairman and C.E.O. of Levi Strauss.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.406
Where'd you get the Canadian tuxedo?

01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:02.742
You ratted us out to Grady.

01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:06.829
I'm not even gonna dignify
myself with a response to that.

01:17:06.913 --> 01:17:09.999
Hey, I got no hard feelings.
Nothin' a few beers can't fix, right?

01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:12.585
Hey, how about
one on me, Ramrod?

01:17:14.212 --> 01:17:16.839
Excuse me.
Uh, excuse me, guys.

01:17:16.923 --> 01:17:19.258
Yeah. I'll be right back.

01:17:19.343 --> 01:17:20.340
What the fuck?

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.555
We should have taken him
out the back and shot him.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.183
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- I gotta call Ursula.

01:17:27.267 --> 01:17:29.727
Fellas, we got to get him back.
He's gotta pay for this.

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:32.229
Nobody wears that uniform in my station.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.065
- Farva's goin' down!
- Yes! Right!

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.608
- Grady's goin' down!
- Yeah!

01:17:35.692 --> 01:17:38.069
- All of these fuckers are goin' down!
- Yeah!

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:44.325
What?

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:01.926
Welcome to Dimpus Burger.
May I take your order?

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:05.346
Hello in there.
This is Officer Rod Farva.

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:10.017
- Give me a liter of cola!
- Uh, sorry, Officer Farva, I can't--

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:12.645
You want me to come in there, boy?
I'll come in there!

01:18:12.729 --> 01:18:15.481
- Hello?
- Chase him! Chase him!

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:17.942
Let's pull someone over.

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:19.985
Whoo!

01:18:26.326 --> 01:18:30.079
License and registration.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:45.678
When you gotta go,
you gotta go.

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:52.685
We are the Spurbury police!

01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:57.148
Whoo! Hoo!
Who-ho-ho-ho!

01:19:04.489 --> 01:19:07.742
Whoo!

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:10.161
I'm cool. I'm cool.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:16.208
Grady! Get your ass out here!

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:23.591
- Grady!
- I don't want to sound like a wienie...

01:19:23.675 --> 01:19:25.760
- but I think I should call Ursula.
- No way!

01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:28.929
- You sound like a fuckin' wienie.
- Gimme the radio.

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:31.140
Grady? Bruce?

01:19:31.224 --> 01:19:33.350
Fuck it, all right.
Gimme the goddamn radio.

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:36.687
- He's not home!
- Hey, Chief-o!

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.648
This is Officer Rod Farva.
Come in, Ursula.

01:19:39.733 --> 01:19:42.651
- What're you doin'?
- Ursula! I love you, Ursula.

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:45.613
- Come in, Ursula!
- Who is this? Hello?

01:19:45.697 --> 01:19:47.948
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, she's there?

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:50.951
Ursula! Oh, I'm sorry.

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:53.120
Sir, this is a police channel.
Please get off of it.

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:57.625
- I'm tryin' to apologize here.
- Sir, this is not a civilian channel.

01:19:57.709 --> 01:20:00.961
If you’d like to have a conversation
with someone, please go to Channel Five.

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:04.131
All right, Thorny.
Pop it over to Channel Five.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.384
Look what I found!
A two-by-four!

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.303
- You go, girl!
- Foster!

01:20:09.387 --> 01:20:11.263
- Help me out here, Rabbit.
- Foster, is that you?

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:14.183
- I need someone sober.
- You got it, Cap.

01:20:14.267 --> 01:20:18.020
- And, hit!
- My ass in your face, Thorny.

01:20:18.104 --> 01:20:21.941
So-So, hey, what's goin' on?

01:20:22.025 --> 01:20:24.443
Don't use that boyfriend voice with me.
What are you doing?

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:26.737
Don't use that boyfriend
voice with me, Foster!

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:28.989
- Hit!
- Yea!

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:33.994
Now, did you know that Farva was the one
who told Grady about our plans?

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:39.124
- Yeah. I know. He's working for us now.
- So, I'm sorry.

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:42.628
- I don't know. Can I come see you?
- I love you.

01:20:42.712 --> 01:20:47.550
- Listen, Foster--
- Ursula! I'm naked!

01:20:47.634 --> 01:20:51.679
Listen, Foster? You want
to get these guys back?

01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:55.724
- Yeah!
- I know a way we can get 'em really good.

01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:58.300
Yeah, let's get 'em good!
Did you hear that, guys?

01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.186
Yes, sir.

01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:01.522
Okay, I get off work at 10:30.

01:21:01.606 --> 01:21:03.983
Meet me at Route 9 and Okeechobee Rod,
and don't be late.

01:21:04.067 --> 01:21:07.194
- She said, "Okeechobee."
- She's okey-dokey.

01:21:12.242 --> 01:21:14.201
She's late.

01:21:16.913 --> 01:21:18.831
So, Foster...

01:21:18.915 --> 01:21:23.127
- is this your usual meeting spot?
- No.

01:21:25.755 --> 01:21:27.923
- Fuckin' shit!
- That was Galikanokus!

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:30.885
Let's get him!

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.894
Outta the car!
Goddamn it!

01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:42.563
Same shit, different day,
huh, Rabbit?

01:21:42.647 --> 01:21:45.608
Everybody outta the car!
I said now!

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:48.903
You're all under arrest for stealing
a Spurbury police vehicle.

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:52.990
No, Farva, you are under arrest for being
a total and complete fuckhead!

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:56.327
Y-You don't want to do this, Rod
We gotta go catch that truck.

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:59.997
Using what?
Super citizen power?

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.874
Galikanokus is on that truck!

01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:04.668
I'll believe that when
me shit turns purple...

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:08.172
- and smells like rainbow sherbet.
- Does it sound like that when I say it?

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:12.134
Farva! You are not stopping me
from getting my job back!

01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:14.511
Get him, Mac!

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:18.265
- I got a job now.
- You're a local cop.

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:20.768
- You're goddamn right I am!
- You ratted us out!

01:22:20.852 --> 01:22:24.980
No, Thorny.
I barely had a job before.

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:27.775
Farva, get the coffee.
Farva, hit the radio.

01:22:27.859 --> 01:22:31.737
Farva, clean the cells!
I'm a cop, goddamn it!

01:22:31.821 --> 01:22:35.783
I got my own car, now.
I get to bust criminals!

01:22:35.867 --> 01:22:38.327
It's what I gotta do!

01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:42.456
- You screwed us over.
- No, Thorny.

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:46.502
Okay. Okay, I did!
I did, I did.

01:22:46.586 --> 01:22:48.253
- I'm sorry, Rodney.
- Come on, Rod.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:51.298
- Oh, Thorny!
- No, no, no. Please. Come on.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:54.009
Listen, listen. This is your big chance.

01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:58.597
When we go up there,
and we're wrong, no big deal.

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:03.060
But if we’re right,
you can be a hero.

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:06.397
Come on. Team Ramrod!

01:23:09.901 --> 01:23:12.736
Will you look at that?

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:15.990
- We got 'em, Cap.
- We got 'em, we got 'em!

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:20.494
- Oh.
- Fuckin' Galikanokus!

01:23:20.578 --> 01:23:22.621
There's Canadian
markings on that plane.

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:26.417
Okay, Foster. You and Rabbit come
around in a classic pincer move.

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:29.545
- Mac, I need you to take--
- No, no, no, Thorny. Me and you!

01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:32.840
We outflank 'em, and we do,
like, a submarine move.

01:23:32.924 --> 01:23:35.426
- Team Ramrod?
- Shut up, Farva.

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:37.928
- Farva, you're leaning--
- Wait a minute!

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.765
Oh! The locals!
I hate those fuckin' guys!

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:46.186
Goddamn it, you dipshits! If I had my car,
I'd have been in on this bust!

01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:50.065
Shh! Rodney! Rodney,
get your ass back here!

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:53.777
Here we go again--
What the fuck?

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:57.781
- Oh, did you see that? He kissed that guy!
- Shh!

01:23:59.909 --> 01:24:01.994
Holy shit!

01:24:02.078 --> 01:24:04.830
God! We should have known.

01:24:04.914 --> 01:24:09.543
Sok wait. The local cops are selling
Afghani grass to the Canadians?

01:24:09.627 --> 01:24:12.087
Assholes!
- No, Rabbit, it's comin' in from Canada

01:24:12.172 --> 01:24:14.923
Canadian grass. Ah!

01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:17.092
- Assholes.
- No!

01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:20.345
The local mothers are
running protection for 'em.

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:22.639
Oh, I guess I'm the asshole.

01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:27.269
I'm sorry we didn't wait for you, but--

01:24:27.353 --> 01:24:29.354
Listen to me, Foster.
I need to tell you something.

01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:34.860
- What, are you guys drunk?
- No!

01:24:34.944 --> 01:24:36.862
- Your local buddies are runnin' grass!
- Listen, I know.

01:24:36.946 --> 01:24:40.021
I know what they're
doing. I've known for awhile.

01:24:40.321 --> 01:24:41.366
You know this?

01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:43.535
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you in on it?

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:47.998
No! They keep me on dispatch. I didn't know
what to do when I found out about it.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:50.834
- I was afraid I'd lose my job.
- Oh.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.920
You should have just told us.
We would have arrested them.

01:24:53.004 --> 01:24:55.964
- Yeah, we used to be cops, remember? Shh!
- I remember--

01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:59.301
No offense, but the less you guys knew,
the less you could screw up.

01:24:59.385 --> 01:24:59.541
Oh.

01:24:59.841 --> 01:25:02.805
I was trying to stop it
without getting brought down.

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:04.264
Th-- That's why I helped
you find the reefer,

01:25:04.564 --> 01:25:06.058
that's why I helped you
guys steal the Winnebago...

01:25:06.142 --> 01:25:08.769
and that's why
I brought you... here tonight.

01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:11.855
You didn't do this
because you like Foster? Shh!

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.191
No, I mean--
I do like Foster, but I--

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:15.178
But you used him.

01:25:15.478 --> 01:25:18.028
Yeah, I guess so.
But I really like him now.

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.155
Ah!

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.700
- This is so good--
- This is kind of awkward.

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:29.456
I hate to break up the "like-fest,"
but it's prime time for crime-time!

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:32.751
But wait! Hey, hey, hey!
Are you guys kidding? Look at yourselves.

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:35.504
You saw what they did to
Galikanokus's girlfriend.

01:25:35.588 --> 01:25:37.214
And you guys are drunk,
and unarmed.

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:39.591
Oh, hey, I am sober as a bird.

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:43.554
I am drunk.

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:53.313
- What do you got?
- No guns. They got flares.

01:25:53.398 --> 01:25:55.440
And some string.

01:26:01.614 --> 01:26:05.033
Oh, Farva,
you sad, lonely man.

01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:05.435
Ugh.

01:26:05.735 --> 01:26:09.454
Oh, wait. He's got
your name written on it.

01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:11.456
- Oh!
- Ooh.

01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:15.174
Chief! Chief Grady! I
secured the perimeter, sir.

01:26:15.474 --> 01:26:16.128
Farva!

01:26:16.212 --> 01:26:19.965
Sorry I missed the call.
Looks like we got 'em. Rock 'n' roll!

01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:23.886
What the hell are you doin' here, Farva?
Put that pistol down!

01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:25.679
- Qu'est-ce-que c'est ca?
- English!

01:26:25.763 --> 01:26:28.307
- Chief!
- Put a bullet in him, Grady.

01:26:28.391 --> 01:26:31.101
What the fuck is this?

01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:34.897
- Grady?
- Shit, what the fuck is this?

01:26:34.981 --> 01:26:37.274
Shoot it!

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:48.660
- That's my car.
- Grady!

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:51.163
- That's my girl!
- Grady!

01:26:51.247 --> 01:26:53.290
Smy, Burton, check that out.

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:04.009
- What are ya, drunk?
- Drunk enough to kick your ass.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.846
Let's see what

Two-time Navy champion.

01:27:53.184 --> 01:27:56.353

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:05.570

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:12.077

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.958
Here we go.

01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:20.294
"Dear John..."

01:28:20.378 --> 01:28:22.921
"Congratulations are due to you..."

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:26.925
"and your men
for your brave, impressive..."

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:30.012
"but most of all unorthodox tactics..."

01:28:30.096 --> 01:28:32.139
"in thwarting the drug-smuggling ring..."

01:28:32.223 --> 01:28:34.349
"and extreme police corruption."

01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:37.352
- Ooh. She loves us.
- All right.

01:28:37.437 --> 01:28:41.189
"I cannot stress enough how proud
we at the statehouse are of you."

01:28:41.274 --> 01:28:45.068
"The great State of Vermont could
use more officers like your men."

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:49.114
"As you requested, we have
reevaluated the financial situation..."

01:28:49.198 --> 01:28:51.033
"regarding your unit."

01:28:51.117 --> 01:28:54.161
And we're gonna buy you a tank.

01:28:54.245 --> 01:28:57.497
"Due to our tight fiscal situation..."

01:28:57.582 --> 01:29:00.542
"we regret to inform you
that we are still..."

01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:03.545
"going to have to close your station."

01:29:05.381 --> 01:29:08.592
"Good luck in Sherburne, John."

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:11.261
"And give your men my best."

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.264
"Sincerely..."

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:16.683
Governor Fuckhead.

01:29:20.271 --> 01:29:23.231
I did not see that coming.

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:48.924
I told you to bring the handcart.

01:29:49.008 --> 01:29:52.719
- Sorry.
- Tilt it.

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:56.056
Oh, goddamn, I remember
these things being lighter!

01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:58.558
I think I'm gonna drop a nut!

01:29:58.643 --> 01:30:01.228
- Shit.
- Hope they like foam.

01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:04.439
It's not so bad. Good exercise.

01:30:04.524 --> 01:30:07.734
- Cool uniforms.
- Yeah. All the beer you can drink.

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:09.611
I'm into that!

01:30:13.699 --> 01:30:16.368
Beer!

01:30:16.452 --> 01:30:20.205
- Oh, God.
- You order the keg of St. Anky?

01:30:20.289 --> 01:30:22.582
Uh, yeah!

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:25.419
But aren't you guys
the Highway Patrol?

01:30:25.503 --> 01:30:27.838
Yeah, but our station
got shut down, so--

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:30.715
Oh, no shit, man!

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.926
Yeah, shit.
This your keg?

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:36.012
Oh, my-my Dad ordered it.
But he's asleep right now.

01:30:37.181 --> 01:30:41.268
Keg's here!

01:30:41.352 --> 01:30:44.563
Oh, St. Anky!

01:30:44.647 --> 01:30:46.773
- Oh, God. No!
- No, no, no!

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:49.734
Hey, man. Hey, bro.
It's cool, man. They got fired!

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:53.238
No shit?

01:30:53.322 --> 01:30:56.366
No shit, man!

01:30:56.451 --> 01:31:00.120
- All right, all right. Where's the keg go?
- Put it in the rec room, man.

01:31:02.748 --> 01:31:05.584
Make room, make room.
What took you guys so long to get here?

01:31:05.668 --> 01:31:07.627
What'd you do?
Brew it yourself?

01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:10.297
- You're cool, man.
- I am cool.

01:31:10.381 --> 01:31:14.468
Check this out. Um, why don't you guys
put that, um...

01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:16.470
over there?

01:31:18.681 --> 01:31:21.683
- Move it, move it, move it.
- We want a drink! Come on.

01:31:21.767 --> 01:31:24.352
Tap this thing!

01:31:24.437 --> 01:31:27.647
Actually, you know what?
I think it's better...

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:30.484
Feng Shui if it’s, uh
over there.

01:31:30.568 --> 01:31:32.986
Definitely. Definitely better over there.

01:31:40.077 --> 01:31:42.621
Oh, wait, wait. Guys Guys.
You know what?

01:31:42.705 --> 01:31:45.081
Man, it's probably
better for the flow...

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:47.459
if you put it back over here.

01:31:52.089 --> 01:31:54.633
And don't forget
to tap that keg, guys.

01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:58.803
Okay, okay. Somebody's
gonna need to sign for this...

01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:00.805
and I need to see some I.D.

01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:06.186
Look, you know what?
I don't have any I.D.

01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:10.607
But, uh, Abraham Lincoln
here, he says that I'm 21 ...

01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:12.609
and he never told a lie.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.822
Yeah, actually it was George Washington
that never told a lie.

01:32:17.907 --> 01:32:20.575
You guys drive a hard bargain, but--

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:23.453
Actually, you know what?

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:26.581
Why don't you guys split it?

01:32:26.666 --> 01:32:29.876
That was good, man.

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:32.879
- Are you ready for the fun part?
- Oh, yeah.

01:32:32.964 --> 01:32:36.049
'Cause here comes
the fun part: Spurbury Police!

01:32:36.133 --> 01:32:38.093
You're all under arrest!

01:32:42.265 --> 01:32:44.683
- Come on back, now.
- Oh, yeah.

01:32:55.111 --> 01:32:57.320
All this for a noise complaint?

01:32:58.489 --> 01:33:04.077
I love acid--

01:33:04.161 --> 01:33:06.746
Cops.

01:33:08.165 --> 01:33:10.875
What the crap?
How come nobody called me?

01:33:12.712 --> 01:33:17.215
- We're in trouble, aren't we?
- Oh, yeah. You're in big trouble.

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:25.849
And if you really want to choke somebody,
you gotta hit the Adam's apple.
