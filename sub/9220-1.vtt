04:26.384 --> 04:29.220
Enemy neutralized, ladies and gentlemen.

04:29.272 --> 04:31.014
Objective completed.

04:33.224 --> 04:35.435
- Very nice.
- Yes, very nice.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.818
Introducing your host, Dr Howard Marner.

04:44.870 --> 04:46.903
President of Nova Robotics

05:08.758 --> 05:10.541
Well, ladies and gentlemen

05:10.593 --> 05:14.387
I want you to meet strategic artificially
intelligent nuclear transport

05:15.472 --> 05:17.849
Or SAINT, as we call it.

05:25.482 --> 05:28.683
If a question of survival,
then SAINT is the answer

05:28.735 --> 05:31.820
It is quite simply, the most
sophisticated robot on planet Earth.

05:34.782 --> 05:39.912
Adaptable to steaming jungle and burning
deserts and frozen arctic wastes

05:41.455 --> 05:42.456
Well, of course it's adaptable
because it's a robot.

05:44.458 --> 05:46.617
Therefore, impervious to...

05:46.669 --> 05:49.921
- the ravages of nature.
- Crush ice.

05:55.343 --> 05:58.137
Glass. Ice.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.681
Gin.

06:01.266 --> 06:02.267
Tonic.

06:04.477 --> 06:06.561
A squeeze of lime.

06:10.482 --> 06:13.694
- Your cocktail, Dr. Marner.
- Thank you, Number 2.

06:18.031 --> 06:20.116
Just the way I like it...

06:20.168 --> 06:22.202
shaken, but not stirred.

06:25.663 --> 06:27.164
Oh my...

06:27.290 --> 06:28.165
Well...

06:28.207 --> 06:32.628
One thing we can't control is the weather. The
man upstairs is still in charge of that department.

06:32.680 --> 06:37.800
So, why don't we just move our
little presentation back into the lab?

07:03.073 --> 07:05.826
- Oh, and one more thing Dr. Marner.
- Yes, Senator Mills.

07:05.868 --> 07:08.954
Where's the young man
that actually designed these things?

07:09.006 --> 07:10.404
- Dr. Crosby?
- Yes.

07:10.456 --> 07:12.124
We were told we would be meeting with him.

07:12.176 --> 07:13.401
And so you shall.

07:13.453 --> 07:14.575
- When?
- Soon.

07:14.627 --> 07:16.587
Maybe not today, but soon.

07:16.639 --> 07:18.547
- Why not today?
- Flu.

07:18.630 --> 07:23.009
I'd feel happier about approving this
project if I could speak with him.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.501
I'll see what I can do.

07:25.553 --> 07:28.514
Would you excuse me for just...
I'll be back in just a second.

07:28.890 --> 07:33.394
Norman, bolt up the motion control system please.
Don't forget that. It's very important.

07:33.446 --> 07:35.172
Where is he?

07:35.224 --> 07:36.897
I need him.

07:36.949 --> 07:37.679
Stat!

07:37.731 --> 07:38.732
Excuse me sir.

07:39.524 --> 07:42.194
Crosby... he is hiding in the toilet, sir.

07:42.246 --> 07:44.352
Public relations is everybody's job.

07:44.404 --> 07:47.678
Well he is sitting at the cross
they are making him dog sick, sir.

07:47.730 --> 07:50.953
Look. He's supposed to be here.
I want him here. I pay him to be here.

07:51.005 --> 07:54.081
Well, the last time I am seeing him,
he is busy vomiting, sir.

07:54.133 --> 07:57.041
Well, clean him up and
send him out to hob nob.

07:57.093 --> 07:58.417
Stat!

08:08.261 --> 08:11.472
Newton, come on, hurry up.
They are waiting for you.

08:15.183 --> 08:17.811
Newton Crosby. You must make
instantaneous appearance.

08:17.863 --> 08:19.093
Marner says "Stat".

08:19.145 --> 08:22.274
You have to go
hob nob with the big wigs.

08:23.692 --> 08:26.611
Is that a yes or the number
of your intelligence quotient?

08:26.663 --> 08:28.019
Ben, I don't hob nob.

08:28.071 --> 08:30.699
If you you like all that P.R. crap,
why don't you go hob nob.

08:30.751 --> 08:32.940
Mingle with the brass. Have a ball.

08:32.991 --> 08:36.328
I am sick of wearing
the dress in this family.

08:38.496 --> 08:43.126
Crosby, now don't you hang up on me. I know
you're there. I want you up here right away!

08:43.179 --> 08:45.786
Come on Newton! Swallow
your guts. You can do it.

08:45.838 --> 08:48.674
Show them that you're a hot shot
fun guy underneath your clothes.

08:48.726 --> 08:49.997
Now, what do they need me for?

08:50.049 --> 08:53.219
To tell them each robot costs
10 million dollars and it kills people?

08:53.271 --> 08:54.846
Ben, a child of four can tell them that.

08:54.898 --> 08:56.254
That is why they are needing you.

08:56.306 --> 08:58.631
- Now come on. Hurry up!
- Just one dance.

08:58.683 --> 09:00.768
Now, I have to go to the jack.
So you wait for me.

09:00.820 --> 09:01.769
The "john."

09:03.521 --> 09:04.804
Oh, ya, you're doing real good.

09:04.856 --> 09:08.483
- Just keep working on those last two bars.
- Let us go!

09:12.446 --> 09:13.447
Coming through, please.

09:14.072 --> 09:18.410
Wine coolers. Perier, Long Island ice tea.

09:18.462 --> 09:19.786
Please take a drink.

09:20.078 --> 09:21.903
...he's putting on a tie.

09:21.955 --> 09:24.249
He's going to tell you about
these peace time uses.

09:24.301 --> 09:26.401
It's got plenty of peace time uses.

09:26.453 --> 09:28.502
You mean besides serving gin and tonic?

09:29.837 --> 09:32.798
The only way to secure the peace,
Senator, and I'm sure you know...

09:32.850 --> 09:34.665
is be prepared. See...

09:34.717 --> 09:38.346
We can parachute these robot guys
behind enemy lines.

09:38.398 --> 09:40.921
They hide out till
the first strike blows over.

09:40.973 --> 09:44.100
Then, each one of these little boogers
carries a 25 megaton bomb

09:44.142 --> 09:48.855
right up the middle main street of Moscow.
Like the mail man bringing bad news.

09:48.907 --> 09:52.557
We call it "Operation Gotcha Last".

09:52.609 --> 09:55.737
- That's what you call insuring peace.
- Oh, ya...

09:55.789 --> 09:56.613
just...

09:56.655 --> 10:00.367
We're all thinking the same way. Would you
like to see our control center, Senator?

10:06.664 --> 10:10.084
Hey, Norman. You better get
number 5 off that generator, man.

10:11.001 --> 10:13.212
OK, OK, I'll get to it.

10:22.428 --> 10:23.680
Run, Jim!

10:33.606 --> 10:34.941
Jesus H God!

10:35.358 --> 10:37.026
What the hell happened?

10:37.318 --> 10:39.027
I don't know.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.989
Oh my God! It's fried.

10:45.951 --> 10:48.370
Oh! We're in deep shit now, man.

10:49.329 --> 10:50.862
I hope got a few million bucks.

10:50.914 --> 10:54.042
Because that's what they're going
to charge us if this think is fried.

10:54.094 --> 10:56.377
- Everything checks out.
- What?

10:57.044 --> 11:00.047
It's amazing.
Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.

11:00.256 --> 11:05.428
OK, robots. Verbal command. Access
code 29 report to disarming section.

11:06.888 --> 11:09.140
Get out of here, you little crap bucket!

11:09.192 --> 11:10.266
Go on!

11:36.206 --> 11:37.791
It's the ultimate soldier.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.367
Obeys orders, never asks questions.

11:40.419 --> 11:43.005
Originally, I had non-military
purposes in mind.

11:43.057 --> 11:45.466
I designed it as a marital aid.

11:47.968 --> 11:49.220
Very funny.

11:50.262 --> 11:51.085
No...

11:51.137 --> 11:54.307
I'm sure we'll all agree that
Dr. Crosby has designed a weapon...

11:54.359 --> 11:57.044
that will keep our world safe
for all time.

11:57.096 --> 11:59.729
Howard, what's so safe
about blowing people up?

12:09.071 --> 12:13.283
Coffee service coming through.
Please watch your step.

12:14.785 --> 12:15.786
Hot coffee.

12:19.164 --> 12:23.335
Coffee service coming through.
Please watch your step.

13:01.580 --> 13:06.250
Please serve yourselves.
Have a canopy. Shrimp toast. Caviar.

13:08.168 --> 13:10.828
Pate, salmon moose, Cheese Whiz...

13:10.880 --> 13:14.133
Ladies and gentlemen,
our prototypes are here.

13:25.602 --> 13:28.771
I've only counted 4,
so tell me I've miscounted.

13:28.823 --> 13:30.388
- Gag me with a fork, sir.
- What?

13:30.440 --> 13:33.109
Number 5 left the debriefing station
and then it just disappeared.

13:33.161 --> 13:34.851
Oh, God, not today!

13:34.903 --> 13:37.238
- Alright, call security.
- I did, sir, stat.

13:37.290 --> 13:39.823
Good, you did, great.
Just stay calm!

13:54.421 --> 13:56.965
- How're you doing?
- Running late as usual.

14:08.017 --> 14:10.144
I knew it. God damned garbage cans!

14:10.770 --> 14:13.554
Garbage cans with guns.
Newfangled bullshit!

14:13.606 --> 14:16.431
- Have you got anything stronger?
- I got trouble which I don't need.

14:16.483 --> 14:20.111
Because my wife is home cooking a steak
which is going to be dried out when I get there.

14:20.163 --> 14:23.657
I think we got it.
What is that right there?

14:25.325 --> 14:28.286
- Coffee machine.
- You're right, that's what it is.

14:28.370 --> 14:30.862
- It's a coffee machine.
- That's very good, Howard.

14:30.914 --> 14:34.625
Now it is time to freeze this place,
seal the doors, slam the gates shut.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.089
All right, good enough.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.050
OK, here you go.

14:46.303 --> 14:47.763
Main gate. Captain.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.264
- Where did you disappear to?
- I was hob nobbing.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.945
OK, OK come on over here quick.
Come on. Come on, quick.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.656
The guys downstairs say that number
5 was hit by a huge power surge.

15:06.708 --> 15:08.283
He should have shut down.
Did you try the return code?

15:08.335 --> 15:09.701
Ya, no response.

15:31.929 --> 15:33.671
This is very strange, he won't talk to me.

15:33.723 --> 15:37.184
- You sure number 5 is operational?
- Ya, as far as I know.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.270
- Check the list polling system.
- OK.

15:39.322 --> 15:40.886
Let's try the emergency override.

15:40.938 --> 15:42.648
This is bullshit. Just let me go get it.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.808
Access code, 42721.

15:45.860 --> 15:48.518
Access gained, number 5 standing by.

15:48.570 --> 15:50.655
With that ease,
you've gotten him on your terminal.

15:50.707 --> 15:51.656
You're just a fine kid.

15:52.157 --> 15:54.117
Report your position.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.621
Malfunction, need input.

16:09.673 --> 16:11.165
What the hell's a need input for?

16:11.217 --> 16:13.260
I don't know,
I guess it can't triangulate his position.

16:13.312 --> 16:14.376
That's a simple function.

16:14.428 --> 16:17.431
Do you know how to triangulate
your position, Howard?

16:17.483 --> 16:19.214
- No.
- Well, then, there you go.

16:19.266 --> 16:21.226
I'm glad you think
this is all such a joke, Crosby.

16:21.278 --> 16:23.186
Don't worry, Skroeder,
you're not going to miss a meal.

16:23.238 --> 16:25.605
Just shut it down, pick it up.

16:29.817 --> 16:31.601
Unable, malfunction.

16:31.653 --> 16:33.863
How can it refuse to turn itself off?

16:33.915 --> 16:35.062
Maybe it's pissed off.

16:35.114 --> 16:37.023
It's a machine, Skroeder,
it doesn't get pissed off...

16:37.075 --> 16:40.078
it doesn't get happy, it doesn't get sad,
it doesn't laugh at your jokes.

16:40.130 --> 16:43.163
- It just runs programming.
- Usually runs programs.

16:43.830 --> 16:47.199
Anybody try the homing device yet?

16:47.251 --> 16:49.461
- No.
- Oh, come on you guys, use your heads!

16:49.962 --> 16:52.589
It's probably right down the hall and...

16:52.641 --> 16:55.217
Ah... Here it comes...
Here it comes...

16:55.592 --> 16:57.386
And...

16:58.554 --> 17:00.263
Bingo!

17:00.680 --> 17:04.464
Good lord!
It is outside the fence!

17:04.517 --> 17:06.852
Oh, and that is not
the worst of it, Dr. Marner.

17:06.904 --> 17:09.521
Don't tell me its laser is still armed.

17:09.574 --> 17:11.055
Bimbo!

17:11.107 --> 17:12.483
Crosby, what's he going to do?

17:12.535 --> 17:14.016
Howard, it's hard to say.

17:14.068 --> 17:15.976
It's malfunctioning.
It might not do anything.

17:16.028 --> 17:19.614
But it could decide to blow away
anything that moves. Couldn't it?

17:19.665 --> 17:21.867
Couldn't it, Crosby?

17:41.302 --> 17:44.305
Oh, my God. It's not coming back.
We've got to destroy it.

17:44.357 --> 17:46.353
No. Howard, you're
overreacting. You can't...

17:46.405 --> 17:48.350
Look, let us at least try to catch it first.

17:48.402 --> 17:49.800
Ya, we'll panic later, OK?

17:49.852 --> 17:52.813
What if you don't catch it. What if it goes
out and melts down a bus load of nuns...

17:52.865 --> 17:55.190
How would you like to
write the headline on that one?

17:55.242 --> 17:57.150
- Nun soup?
- Ben!

17:58.484 --> 17:59.517
- Howard.
- What?

17:59.569 --> 18:02.447
OK, it's malfunctioning. Think about it.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.273
- What about function?
- Alright, look...

18:05.325 --> 18:07.035
Why don't you get your
team together and Skroeder,

18:07.087 --> 18:07.826
Duke, Otis!

18:07.869 --> 18:09.954
- And detain number 5 the best you can...
- Alright, Howard.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.122
- and still avoid an incident.
- I'm already moving.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.123
And Skroeder,

18:13.415 --> 18:14.917
You understand
you don't have to blow it up.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.868
You don't have to blow it up, Skroeder.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.829
Just try and bring it back in one piece.
- One piece will do.

18:20.881 --> 18:25.177
Whatever it takes to put that stupid
contraption out of commission, gentlemen,

18:25.229 --> 18:28.305
- that's what you do.
- Yes sir.

18:37.188 --> 18:38.971
Give inertial status...

18:39.023 --> 18:43.277
Let's scramble one, maybe it'll listen
to what comes with a decoder.

18:43.329 --> 18:44.143
What is this?

18:44.195 --> 18:46.061
Running diagnostics.
Testing its logic circuits.

18:46.113 --> 18:49.407
Let's just bounce on off its magnesium
casing. What do you think, I don't know.

18:49.459 --> 18:51.868
What is this? Input, Input, Input...

18:52.244 --> 18:53.109
Come on...

18:53.161 --> 18:54.871
Let's boot it up.
See if you can boot it.

18:54.923 --> 18:58.755
Return to D-Station...
Come on. Now!

18:58.807 --> 19:02.587
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?

19:03.046 --> 19:05.464
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?

19:05.516 --> 19:06.465
What is going on?

19:06.674 --> 19:08.332
I don't know,
must be the print scanner...

19:08.384 --> 19:12.096
- it must be reading it some place.
- I'm not understanding the reference

19:18.686 --> 19:20.521
Need input.

19:22.231 --> 19:23.482
Input.

19:52.301 --> 19:55.053
- Did you see something?
- Oh God... I hope not.

19:55.105 --> 19:57.973
- Well, I saw something.
- Ya, me too.

19:58.025 --> 19:59.600
Oh shit!

20:02.852 --> 20:05.584
It's right outside.
- Captain Skroeder, Captain Skroeder

20:05.636 --> 20:08.316
<i>This is Bravo 4, over.
Skroeder, what have you got, over.</i>

20:09.150 --> 20:12.403
He's right in front of us, sir, we're
on the bridge out on 101, over.

20:12.455 --> 20:16.073
We're on our way.
Loose it and you're dead meat.

20:46.936 --> 20:49.480
- It's going berserk.
- Ben, how'd this happen?

20:49.532 --> 20:52.024
Who is knowing how to read
the mind of a robot?

20:54.817 --> 20:56.986
Weeeeee!

21:27.391 --> 21:30.258
I am not cut out for this!
You did this, Crosby...

21:30.310 --> 21:32.186
- Howard!
- so you wouldn't have to talk to those people.

21:32.238 --> 21:33.260
Just calm down.

21:33.312 --> 21:35.857
Excuse me, sir, but we're loosing
its signal. It's going out of range.

21:35.909 --> 21:37.426
We're going to have to follow it now.

21:37.478 --> 21:38.891
Can I get a vehicle? Can I get...

21:38.943 --> 21:42.280
- Howard, is there a van or anything like that?
- Of course there's a van!

21:51.913 --> 21:55.208
Thanks for calling me, Mrs. Cepeda,
where's that son of a bitch?

21:55.260 --> 21:58.503
He's around the bend and up
to no good, you better believe it.

22:00.505 --> 22:03.341
Get the hell down here, Beasley!

22:03.393 --> 22:06.126
- Hey!
- What are you doing home?

22:06.178 --> 22:08.387
This is my home! It's not
your home. I live here.

22:08.439 --> 22:10.039
What are you doing with Beasley?

22:10.091 --> 22:11.588
Uh... well, darn it, you know

22:11.640 --> 22:13.215
he looked kind of sick to me so I thought...

22:13.267 --> 22:15.477
I'd just take him down to the vet
and fix him up a bit.

22:15.529 --> 22:17.255
He doesn't look sick, you look sick.

22:17.307 --> 22:18.929
What did you come back
here for anyway?

22:18.981 --> 22:22.693
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought that
maybe we could patch things up.

22:22.745 --> 22:25.403
Sort of pick up where we left off.

22:26.487 --> 22:28.573
You know you want me back.

22:28.625 --> 22:30.857
What is this?

22:30.909 --> 22:33.119
Quinn's Medical Research? You slime bag!

22:33.171 --> 22:34.694
The dog is on its last legs.

22:34.746 --> 22:36.935
That's very funny. Why don't
you get the hell out of here!

22:36.987 --> 22:39.125
You know what I figure?
I figure you owe me some money.

22:39.177 --> 22:40.919
- So I'm just here to collect.
- I owe you?

22:40.971 --> 22:42.869
- That's right.
- I supported you.

22:42.921 --> 22:46.548
That was my money you used
to buy your big red dorkmobile!

22:46.600 --> 22:48.008
No! Damn it!

22:49.551 --> 22:50.552
Hey! Hey!

22:53.096 --> 22:56.183
- Do not do that car!
- Get away from me!

22:58.060 --> 23:02.063
Alright. If this is your idea of playing
hard to get, you can knock it off now.

23:02.115 --> 23:03.637
You mutation!

23:03.689 --> 23:06.817
- God damn it! Don't ever call me that!
- You don't even know what it means!

23:06.869 --> 23:08.778
Ya, well, I can find out!

23:09.737 --> 23:12.823
Hey! You! You leave her alone!

23:17.578 --> 23:19.558
- Oh, God!
- Oh honey!

23:19.610 --> 23:21.488
- Are you OK, honey?
- Ya.

23:21.540 --> 23:23.573
- Are you sure?
- Ya, I'm fine.

23:23.625 --> 23:25.210
And I thought he
was going to be a nice one.

23:25.262 --> 23:26.743
- Different from the other ones.
- Ya right!

23:26.795 --> 23:30.549
- Well, he sure was better looking.
- Well, looks aren't everything.

23:31.508 --> 23:34.219
I know that.
Every time I look at Mr. Cepeda.

23:34.271 --> 23:36.878
Honey, listen,
I hate to tell you this but a...

23:36.930 --> 23:39.807
the man from the city...
he was snooping around again.

23:39.859 --> 23:41.507
I told them all this was temporary.

23:41.559 --> 23:43.592
It's just until I can find homes for them.

23:43.644 --> 23:45.980
Well, he says that four years
is not too temporary.

23:46.032 --> 23:47.189
He was going to call the sheriff on you.

23:47.241 --> 23:48.305
Oh, great!

23:48.357 --> 23:51.172
Maybe the sheriff would like a pet?

23:51.224 --> 23:54.190
Beasley. Beasley come to me, baby.

23:54.242 --> 23:57.104
Good Beasley!
Beasley, come here.

23:57.156 --> 23:59.450
Did he scare you?
Did he scare you, honey?

23:59.502 --> 24:00.441
I'm sorry.

24:00.493 --> 24:03.913
I feel like I've been cooped up
inside this lab forever.

24:03.965 --> 24:06.624
Well, it's an opportunity
to spread your legs.

24:06.676 --> 24:08.131
Good to smell the breezes, hum?

24:08.183 --> 24:09.534
Has it changed much out there?

24:09.586 --> 24:11.462
Oh, yes, you can say that two times.

24:11.514 --> 24:12.870
Hey! Hey! Come on you guys!

24:12.922 --> 24:15.465
Come on, get points!
Skroeder's coming up empty!

24:15.517 --> 24:17.958
We're on our way, Howard,
to the great outdoors.

24:18.010 --> 24:21.013
Newton, you know what is out there
in the great outdoors?

24:21.065 --> 24:22.921
Girls. Ummm.

24:22.973 --> 24:25.507
With brassieres and legs.

24:25.559 --> 24:27.227
You have the working knowledge the girl?

24:27.279 --> 24:28.677
No, but I read about them.

24:28.729 --> 24:31.148
Well then... maybe I can furnish you
with some schematic drawings.

24:31.190 --> 24:32.346
All right.

24:32.398 --> 24:35.099
Hey! Who told you could
take Number One?

24:35.151 --> 24:37.486
Howard, logically, if we need
protection from Number Five...

24:37.538 --> 24:38.894
this is the best weapon
we could have.

24:38.946 --> 24:41.407
Great, great!
So, instead of $11 million on the loose...

24:41.459 --> 24:43.414
we're going to have
twenty-two.

24:43.466 --> 24:45.369
And plus, we are needing
gas money.

24:49.207 --> 24:50.916
I'm sorry.
I just...

24:51.249 --> 24:53.043
I have to draw the line
at snakes.

24:53.668 --> 24:57.380
Ya, I'm sure it would make
a wonderful pet, but...

24:57.631 --> 25:01.676
wait, isn't there a home
for cobras somewhere?

25:02.219 --> 25:04.304
Can you hang on
for a second?

25:12.895 --> 25:15.397
Can I call you right back?
Thanks.

25:19.693 --> 25:21.654
Hey! Get out of there!

25:25.074 --> 25:26.741
Frank?

25:27.325 --> 25:29.410
Mr. Scumo!

25:33.206 --> 25:35.708
I know you're in there.

25:37.752 --> 25:40.713
Get out! Get out!
I'll call the cops.

25:52.558 --> 25:54.434
What?
Are you deaf?

26:02.316 --> 26:04.277
Oh, my God!

26:09.240 --> 26:13.619
Oh, my God! I knew they'd
pick me. I just knew it.

26:17.790 --> 26:19.000
Hello.

26:21.209 --> 26:22.460
Well, I guess...

26:23.837 --> 26:26.548
welcome to my planet.

26:29.050 --> 26:32.179
Oh boy! Is this thrilling or what?

26:35.599 --> 26:37.184
Don't be scared.

26:37.392 --> 26:39.101
I'm a friend.

26:39.602 --> 26:41.520
Friend?

26:45.274 --> 26:47.610
Do you know
the word "friend"?

26:48.277 --> 26:51.280
Because that's what I am.
I'm a friend.

26:51.655 --> 26:53.657
So, here I come.

26:54.074 --> 26:57.619
Nice and extremely friendly.

27:11.966 --> 27:15.511
Hi.
It's me.

27:18.847 --> 27:21.600
So, this is earth.

27:21.767 --> 27:24.478
I'm Stephanie.
Speck.

27:25.395 --> 27:27.147
No offense, but...

27:27.439 --> 27:30.734
is that really you or is that
like a space suit...

27:31.068 --> 27:32.861
and you're inside some place,
maybe just your brain...

27:33.152 --> 27:35.238
in a little jar
or something like that?

27:35.738 --> 27:38.449
- Malfunction.
- You can talk!

27:38.783 --> 27:41.536
Malfunction.
Need input.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.538
Input.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.706
That's information.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.417
Listen, I am full of it.

27:48.793 --> 27:52.295
Why don't you come to my house
and we can sit down and talk...

27:52.921 --> 27:55.715
get to know each other.
Communicate. Input.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.970
Come on.
It's okay.

28:03.014 --> 28:07.018
No, no.
I mean come with me.

28:09.270 --> 28:13.107
Come here. This way.

28:23.284 --> 28:24.942
Come here.

28:24.994 --> 28:28.058
Come on. Right this way.

28:28.110 --> 28:31.124
March! Heel! Giddy up!

28:31.791 --> 28:33.585
- Forward!
- Forward!

28:34.294 --> 28:36.296
Forward, forward.
Come forward.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.965
That's good.
That's really good.

28:39.215 --> 28:41.426
Don't be afraid, guys.
He's a friend.

28:41.759 --> 28:43.793
These are animals.
They're lower life forms.

28:43.845 --> 28:47.097
They're always a little skittish
around new people, aliens. Whatever.

28:47.149 --> 28:49.808
Malfunction. Need input.

28:49.892 --> 28:52.342
Input.
All right, right. You got it, OK.

28:52.394 --> 28:55.606
This is a house.
We live within it, inside it.

28:55.939 --> 28:58.609
- We have a floor, see...
- Floor.

28:59.109 --> 29:01.028
And we have the opposite
of a floor...

29:01.320 --> 29:02.863
which is the ceiling.
Look up!

29:03.280 --> 29:04.687
Ceiling.

29:04.739 --> 29:06.407
We have windows and...

29:06.866 --> 29:09.452
air! Look over here.

29:11.037 --> 29:12.330
Light.

29:14.499 --> 29:15.833
Music.

29:16.959 --> 29:19.545
And... look at this.

29:19.597 --> 29:22.130
This is a plant.
See?

29:22.380 --> 29:24.257
And these are goldfish.

29:24.799 --> 29:26.583
Don't touch.

29:26.635 --> 29:28.824
And look over there.

29:28.876 --> 29:30.962
See, these are ants.

29:31.014 --> 29:33.433
They're not aunts,
they're ants.

29:33.850 --> 29:35.852
It's an ant farm.

29:36.436 --> 29:40.856
Look! These are my bunnies.
Edwina and Norman.

29:41.357 --> 29:43.108
Norman.

29:43.359 --> 29:45.277
I bet you got some amazing
animals in your planet.

29:46.862 --> 29:48.614
Good, there you go.

29:48.906 --> 29:50.699
This is Earth, where
we are now.

29:51.242 --> 29:54.495
You are here.
Here.

29:54.870 --> 29:56.831
- Oregon.
- Oregon.

29:57.081 --> 29:58.915
Home of the beaver,
famous for cherries.

29:59.207 --> 30:01.376
Beavers.
Cherries. Input.

30:01.793 --> 30:03.419
I'm giving you
great input.

30:03.586 --> 30:05.755
More input.
More input.

30:06.464 --> 30:08.675
How about pictures?
Do you like pictures?

30:09.259 --> 30:10.718
We have a lot
of pictures here.

30:11.261 --> 30:12.887
A lot of them.

30:13.888 --> 30:17.516
This is a picture
of an aardvark.

30:18.559 --> 30:20.477
See that? It's an aardvark.

30:20.811 --> 30:23.939
- It's a mammal.
- Input. Aardvark.

30:24.231 --> 30:27.693
- Abyssinia, Adams...
- Holy Crowl. You can read.

30:32.281 --> 30:33.824
Input.

30:34.116 --> 30:35.867
- More input.
- Okay, no problem.

30:37.451 --> 30:39.036
Volume two.
No problem.

30:47.003 --> 30:50.047
- My neck.
- Sorry.

30:50.381 --> 30:51.956
This is very healthful
for the neck.

30:52.008 --> 30:54.593
Can you believe it's been
5 years since I've driven?

30:54.645 --> 30:55.917
I'd say ten.

30:55.969 --> 30:58.002
It's all coming
back to me, though.

30:58.054 --> 31:00.056
You know what many people
are liking at night?

31:00.307 --> 31:02.184
- What?
- Headlights.

31:04.311 --> 31:06.730
- It's a lot better. Thanks.
- Definitely, ya

31:17.656 --> 31:19.533
More input, Stephanie.

31:19.575 --> 31:21.494
- More!
- There isn't anymore.

31:21.660 --> 31:23.621
You've read everything
in the house.

31:25.915 --> 31:28.334
Animal.
Mammal, skunk.

31:29.792 --> 31:32.128
That's a container
drinking glass.

31:32.587 --> 31:35.235
Pasta, semolina,
spaghetti.

31:35.287 --> 31:37.832
Food, liquid,
spaghetti sauce.

31:37.884 --> 31:40.512
Look, this may be hilarious
where you come from...

31:40.564 --> 31:42.430
but on this planet it's considered rude.

31:43.097 --> 31:46.601
Plants, fruits, oranges...

31:46.892 --> 31:49.186
apples, lemons, limes.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.355
That's great.
Thanks a lot.

31:51.688 --> 31:53.148
Fabric.
Tablecloth.

31:53.774 --> 31:55.984
No, my dishes!

31:56.860 --> 31:57.986
Oh, my God!

31:58.320 --> 32:00.322
Breakfast table.
American contemporary.

32:00.656 --> 32:03.242
Oh! My China!

32:03.700 --> 32:05.743
- Numerous fragments.
- Ok, fine...

32:05.795 --> 32:07.411
Some large, some small.

32:08.162 --> 32:10.081
Take a look at this.
Look at that.

32:10.665 --> 32:11.958
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

32:12.375 --> 32:14.335
- See that?
- Input.

32:14.627 --> 32:16.128
Right.
Input, input.

32:16.420 --> 32:17.505
Good.

32:18.256 --> 32:21.717
Ok, here. You hold this.
That's very good.

32:21.769 --> 32:23.635
And stay.
Stay.

32:24.261 --> 32:25.428
<i>At Alaskan Airlines...</i>

32:25.470 --> 32:27.848
<i>our people go out of their way

32:37.524 --> 32:38.900
With your permission...

32:39.025 --> 32:40.558
I know no one's gonna
believe me...

32:40.610 --> 32:42.528
and I'd like them to know
I'm not crazy, so look up!

32:59.252 --> 33:01.129
Input.

33:03.089 --> 33:04.997
This is a barrel of monkeys.

33:05.049 --> 33:07.260
Let us scrape up
some female chicks.

33:07.312 --> 33:08.543
Don't we have to find
a robot?

33:08.595 --> 33:13.099
Pardon me for saying so,
but you're becoming a drag strip.

33:13.141 --> 33:15.935
Girls are not my best suits.
Besides, we got a job to do.

33:16.102 --> 33:18.061
As we're fond of saying
in my country...

33:18.312 --> 33:20.647
"marketplace make dull
home for rodents."

33:20.731 --> 33:24.151
- Where are you from, anyway?
- Bakersfield, originally.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.028
- No, I mean your ancestors.
- Oh, them.

33:27.112 --> 33:29.072
Pittsburgh.

33:38.414 --> 33:40.833
<i>It's the Colgate pump

33:44.629 --> 33:46.130
<i>I wouldn't try anything

33:46.506 --> 33:47.965
<i>Sure we're pals.</i>

33:48.424 --> 33:50.092
<i>No, I didn't do it.
You got me wrong.</i>

33:50.593 --> 33:52.460
<i>I brought you out here.
I work with you.</i>

33:52.512 --> 33:54.179
<i>You're the last guy in the world
I'd try to cross, you know that.</i>

33:54.513 --> 33:56.681
<i>You wouldn't do anything to me.
Give me a chance.</i>

33:57.015 --> 33:58.517
<i>You can have anything I got.
Anything.</i>

33:58.934 --> 34:01.311
Have you been watching
all night?

34:01.853 --> 34:03.313
Come on.

34:05.482 --> 34:07.400
Don't get up.
I can take care of this.

34:09.694 --> 34:11.478
Haven't you had enough
of this stuff?

34:11.530 --> 34:15.991
You lose IQ points the longer you
watch. There've been actual studies.

34:18.409 --> 34:21.163
Look, you're going to become
the 1st alien couch potato...

34:21.215 --> 34:23.916
and I'm not kidding.
Give me that. Give me that thing.

34:32.715 --> 34:34.926
<i>...by eating Thomases
English Muffin...</i>

34:35.260 --> 34:37.011
- Have a heart!
- "Have a heart"...

34:37.262 --> 34:38.972
"Don't cry, little girl",
"Smile your tears away"...

34:39.222 --> 34:41.516
and dozens of other hits all
in this big two-record set.

34:42.016 --> 34:44.060
Call now! Our operators
are standing by.

34:45.228 --> 34:46.855
Are you tired
of bill piling up?

34:47.230 --> 34:49.313
Simplify your life with
Accountant in a Can.

34:49.690 --> 34:51.024
And if you act now,
we'll send along...

34:51.400 --> 34:54.027
You didn't come a million miles
to do TV commercials, did you?

34:54.987 --> 34:57.062
<i>- Duracell...
- Of course you didn't.</i>

34:57.114 --> 35:00.826
Come on. There's something
I wanna show you outside.

35:01.034 --> 35:03.412
Bird. Raven.
Never more.

35:03.871 --> 35:06.039
Now look.
Look.

35:06.706 --> 35:11.002
Look.
No, no. There.

35:11.544 --> 35:13.004
See?

35:14.255 --> 35:16.257
Beautiful.

35:16.757 --> 35:19.719
- Light bulb.
- No. Sun.

35:20.386 --> 35:22.513
Beautiful.
No sun.

35:23.556 --> 35:27.434
- Beautiful sun.
- Beautiful.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.853
Rhinoceros, turtle...

35:30.145 --> 35:31.855
Volkswagen.

35:32.147 --> 35:35.025
You mean with that fat little
body, you can see those things.

35:39.446 --> 35:40.906
Beautiful animal.

35:41.239 --> 35:43.532
Mammal, canine, dog.

35:44.450 --> 35:46.327
Mutt.

35:46.660 --> 35:49.997
- Beasley.
- Beasley.

35:53.584 --> 35:55.169
Beasley, stop it!

35:55.544 --> 35:58.047
Beasley, down!
What are you doing?

35:58.339 --> 35:59.340
Stop it!

35:59.673 --> 36:00.632
Look out!

36:03.468 --> 36:06.304
My God! What happened?
Are you all right?

36:08.139 --> 36:10.225
Please, don't be hurt.
Are you okay?

36:10.809 --> 36:12.352
Say something.

36:13.853 --> 36:16.648
Beautiful Stephanie.

36:21.109 --> 36:23.737
"S A I N T Prototype
number five...

36:24.071 --> 36:27.366
Nova Robotics. Damon,
Washington". You're a robot?

36:27.699 --> 36:29.910
- Yes.
- I thought you were alive number 5.

36:30.202 --> 36:32.496
I let you tear my house
to shreds and you're a robot!

36:32.830 --> 36:36.375
You're a machine from that dumb
war lab place. I'm so stupid.

36:36.667 --> 36:39.377
Stupid: Foolish, gullible,
doltish...

36:39.585 --> 36:41.003
- dumbbell.
- Shut up!

36:41.295 --> 36:43.756
Shut up: Silence, hush,
sit on it, can it.

36:44.048 --> 36:46.050
Am I the jerk of the world?
You're just programmed.

36:46.342 --> 36:49.262
Jerk of the world, turkey,
idiot, pain in the ass.

36:49.846 --> 36:53.349
I hope you're programmed
to pay for the mess you made.

36:57.394 --> 36:58.854
What if there's a reward
out for that thing?

36:59.187 --> 37:00.689
I could take care of as many
animals as I want.

37:01.690 --> 37:02.816
Hello.

37:03.108 --> 37:05.777
I'd like to speak to one of your
head Warmongers, please.

37:06.069 --> 37:09.447
Dr. Warmonger, Marner.
I think this may be something.

37:14.577 --> 37:15.870
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

37:16.120 --> 37:18.038
<i>I'd like you to know
I have one of your robots.</i>

37:18.914 --> 37:20.666
God!

37:20.916 --> 37:23.544
Good.
Yes.

37:24.378 --> 37:26.338
Listen...

37:27.590 --> 37:29.508
thank you very much
for calling.

37:29.842 --> 37:32.051
Our people are
on their way.

37:34.179 --> 37:36.264
Mount up!
We've got it!

37:36.681 --> 37:37.891
Move! Move! Move!

37:38.183 --> 37:41.060
Today, gentleman, today!
Let's go!

37:46.900 --> 37:49.776
We gotta run away!
Let's go, let's go.

37:49.828 --> 37:52.654
In the meantime,
it's very important...

37:52.946 --> 37:54.740
that you try to keep
a safe distance.

37:55.032 --> 37:56.909
How safe a distance?

37:57.284 --> 38:00.037
Well, see, it's malfunctioning.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.249
We have to disassemble
it and check it out.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.793
It's goofy little gadget.

38:06.126 --> 38:09.045
Try to keep everyone as far away
from it as possible, okay?

38:09.295 --> 38:11.923
Not that it's dangerous
or anything like that.

38:12.256 --> 38:14.717
How much is a contraption
like that worth, anyway?

38:14.967 --> 38:17.303
<i>Worth? I don' know.
A few hundred dollars maybe.</i>

38:17.595 --> 38:19.847
No reward or anything
like that for finding it, is there?

38:20.181 --> 38:24.185
Well, we do have a daily tour
of our facilities here.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.604
<i>You know, I might even be able
to get you a student discount.</i>

38:27.979 --> 38:30.023
- Hey! It's gone!
- Gone?

38:30.315 --> 38:31.650
Wooly mammals.

38:31.942 --> 38:33.610
Sheep.
Sweaters, mittens.

38:33.902 --> 38:37.030
Never mind, I see it. Go back
to your nuclear warheads.

38:41.827 --> 38:44.745
Hey, you, Number Five,
What are you doing?

38:45.204 --> 38:47.029
You're gonna scare
my animals, bozo.

38:47.081 --> 38:49.500
Listen, I just called Nova and
they are coming out to get you.

38:49.552 --> 38:52.785
- They'll give you a tune up.
- Tune-up? Input.

38:52.837 --> 38:55.381
They'll take you apart,
find out which screw is loose.

38:55.433 --> 38:59.343
Apart: Undone, dismantle,
dissect, disassemble.

38:59.395 --> 39:00.803
Right.

39:01.178 --> 39:02.637
Jump!

39:03.596 --> 39:08.601
- Look, it's a grasshopper.
- Grasshopper, Orthoptarous insect.

39:09.811 --> 39:11.146
Jump.

39:11.437 --> 39:12.981
That's great.
Okay.

39:17.110 --> 39:19.320
All right, let's go back now.
Come on.

39:19.696 --> 39:21.321
Hey!

39:24.032 --> 39:26.285
Damn it! You klutz!
Look what you did.

39:26.535 --> 39:27.995
Error.

39:28.287 --> 39:30.080
Grasshopper disassembled.

39:30.581 --> 39:32.249
Reassemble.

39:32.708 --> 39:34.491
Reassemble.

39:34.543 --> 39:38.296
I can't reassemble him.
You squashed him, he's dead.

39:38.348 --> 39:39.412
Dead?

39:39.464 --> 39:42.790
Right.
Dead as a doornail.

39:42.842 --> 39:46.095
Reassemble, Stephanie.
Reassemble.

39:47.930 --> 39:50.714
I know you don't understand.

39:50.766 --> 39:53.801
But when you're dead,
you're dead.

39:53.853 --> 39:57.981
That's just the way it is.
Dead is forever.

39:59.191 --> 40:03.236
Squash, dead.

40:03.737 --> 40:07.199
Disassemble, dead!

40:07.908 --> 40:11.036
Disassemble, dead!

40:11.411 --> 40:12.913
Slow down.

40:14.330 --> 40:16.916
- No disassemble.
- Where are you going?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.295
- Please, escape.
- Oh, my God!

40:21.587 --> 40:23.589
Hey, you!
Get out of my truck.

40:23.631 --> 40:27.468
Hey! Hey! Let me in.
Let me in.

40:27.520 --> 40:29.710
No! Don't.

40:29.762 --> 40:31.931
You open this door
right now.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.767
Get out of my truck,
you thief.

40:41.106 --> 40:44.275
No, don't start my truck.
You don't know how to drive.

40:54.284 --> 40:56.787
Come back here with my truck,
you big hunk of tin.

40:56.839 --> 40:58.872
You can't take my truck.

41:15.054 --> 41:17.682
You better be heavily insured
because you'll find yourself...

41:18.432 --> 41:20.434
slapped with
a humongous lawsuit!

41:38.034 --> 41:42.456
Newton, I'm seeing a blip
on my scope. Drive slowly.

41:45.332 --> 41:46.792
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry.

41:47.001 --> 41:50.004
Newton, there it goes.
It's moving at extreme velocipede.

41:58.888 --> 42:01.213
Right of the line.
The right.

42:01.265 --> 42:03.558
Accurate, proper,
correct, appropriate.

42:03.725 --> 42:05.351
My side, over here.
Quickly!

42:05.602 --> 42:06.436
- The right.
- Right.

42:06.728 --> 42:07.854
The right.

42:12.984 --> 42:14.486
Look out! Look out!

42:17.113 --> 42:18.990
My kitchen!

42:22.576 --> 42:23.577
No!

42:25.496 --> 42:28.165
Where she going? I thought
Howard told her to stay put.

42:28.415 --> 42:30.793
Go figure out chicks, man.

42:32.085 --> 42:33.462
Look out!

42:36.882 --> 42:38.967
Oh great! Nice work,
can head.

42:39.019 --> 42:40.635
- Thanks at lot.
- Sorry.

42:43.638 --> 42:46.390
Oh, no. Stop it now!
Stop!

42:47.433 --> 42:48.768
- Turn left or we're going to crash!
- Left!

42:50.686 --> 42:52.688
Turn! Turn!

42:53.481 --> 42:54.690
- Fish!
- Look out!

42:54.899 --> 42:56.567
Salmon!
Sushi.

42:57.193 --> 42:59.236
Jeez, Number Five,
we're going to be killed.

42:59.903 --> 43:02.447
- Disassemble.
- Disassemble all over the place.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.242
Disassemble.
No!

43:12.374 --> 43:14.042
Escape! Escape!

43:14.334 --> 43:16.710
Flee! Hide! Refuge!

43:17.169 --> 43:19.130
What are you afraid of?
What's the matter with you?

43:19.463 --> 43:22.258
Nova Robotics.
Disassemble. Dead.

43:22.508 --> 43:24.802
Disassemble Number Five. Dead.

43:25.136 --> 43:26.971
But you can't die.
You're a machine.

43:27.263 --> 43:29.807
- No.
- No, you're not a machine?

43:30.349 --> 43:33.436
- Yes.
- Yes, you are or you're not?

43:33.519 --> 43:35.311
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

43:35.603 --> 43:37.428
Yes, not.

43:37.480 --> 43:39.670
Talk about a malfunction.

43:39.722 --> 43:41.860
Not malfunction, Stephanie.

43:42.944 --> 43:47.490
Number Five is alive.

43:49.701 --> 43:51.202
Just keep going straight.
Just keep going straight.

43:51.578 --> 43:52.870
Ok, Ok, alright...

43:53.328 --> 43:55.080
We're getting closer.
Ben, we're getting closer.

43:55.372 --> 43:56.623
I can sense it,
I can sense it.

43:56.915 --> 43:58.667
There they are! You see them?
They're right there.

44:01.712 --> 44:03.797
Nova. Disassemble.

44:03.922 --> 44:05.132
Dead. Disassemble number 5.

44:05.549 --> 44:07.134
Dead.

44:07.468 --> 44:10.470
Girlie, girlie, come quick!
Girlie, danger! Come on!

44:10.928 --> 44:12.472
No, no disassemble,

44:12.764 --> 44:15.183
No disassemble,
Number Five.

44:16.225 --> 44:17.643
Come on, you!

44:18.561 --> 44:20.688
What planet is this guy from?

44:20.740 --> 44:22.972
No, no disassemble.

44:23.024 --> 44:25.057
Oh, number 5, don't be scared.

44:25.109 --> 44:27.695
You just wait here a second.
I'll be right back.

44:34.451 --> 44:37.496
Come on, Number one.
Come on. Very good.

44:37.913 --> 44:39.998
Careful. Moving nicely.

44:40.248 --> 44:42.042
Jeez, another one.

44:42.334 --> 44:43.992
How many of these guys
have you got, anyway?

44:44.044 --> 44:47.421
- You are a girl, right?
- Yes, as far as I know.

44:47.473 --> 44:50.174
Hi.
How you doing?

44:50.591 --> 44:52.593
Your little brother's hiding
in my truck.

44:52.927 --> 44:55.221
I have seen some
strange bizarre drivers...

44:55.554 --> 44:58.224
but you may be
awarded the cake.

44:58.516 --> 45:01.227
Me? Talk to your robot.
He did the driving.

45:01.519 --> 45:03.343
Did you say the robot
drove the truck?

45:03.395 --> 45:06.304
Yeah, that's right, chum.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

45:06.356 --> 45:09.317
Oh, bull dyke, you cannot hold
your water with that story, girl.

45:09.369 --> 45:11.350
Hey, I was there, okay?

45:11.402 --> 45:13.738
You're sure you weren't doing any
steering or anything like that?

45:13.822 --> 45:15.438
Yeah, I like to drive off cliffs.

45:15.490 --> 45:18.576
- There's no way my robot could have driven.
- Are you calling me a liar?

45:18.628 --> 45:22.746
No, but maybe you
have amnesia.

45:24.790 --> 45:27.543
Newton! We are wasting
valueless time.

45:27.918 --> 45:29.878
So what are these guys
used for, anyway?

45:30.129 --> 45:32.464
- It's top-secret crap.
- That's what I figured.

45:32.798 --> 45:34.925
Dr. Love, I'd like to get
my robot back.

45:35.217 --> 45:37.636
He knows that,
but he's scared.

45:37.928 --> 45:39.847
It's a machine.
It doesn't get scared.

45:40.139 --> 45:42.140
It doesn't get happy.
It doesn't get sad.

45:42.390 --> 45:45.643
- It just runs programs.
- How do you explain that?

45:51.149 --> 45:52.223
You see?

45:52.275 --> 45:54.819
He's scared that if you take him
apart he's going to die.

45:54.871 --> 45:56.654
- Where'd you hear that?
- Number Five told me.

45:56.706 --> 45:58.722
He'd tell you if you'd
just talk to him.

45:58.774 --> 46:00.740
That's what I've been
trying to do for...

46:00.792 --> 46:03.702
No, I mean with your mouth.
Watch.

46:03.754 --> 46:04.703
Okay, Ben,
this is the plan.

46:04.755 --> 46:05.860
Number Five!

46:05.912 --> 46:08.582
Number Five!
Come on out. It's okay.

46:08.634 --> 46:09.948
- Is it cool?
- It's okay.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.793
These guys aren't going
to hurt you. They're friends.

46:12.169 --> 46:14.734
- No disassemble?
- No, no.

46:14.786 --> 46:17.298
They just want
to talk to you.

46:22.386 --> 46:25.264
Come forward.
Do you remember forward?

46:25.316 --> 46:27.214
- Forward.
- That's it, come on.

46:27.266 --> 46:29.435
I can't believe it.
It's listening to her, not to us.

46:29.487 --> 46:32.146
I am standing here
beside myself.

46:32.198 --> 46:33.971
Okay! Now.

46:34.023 --> 46:36.316
You just tell them
what you told me.

46:36.368 --> 46:40.236
Number Five
not just robot.

46:40.288 --> 46:43.907
There it is! Move out!

46:44.032 --> 46:45.950
Move! Move!

46:46.743 --> 46:48.203
Move out!

46:48.495 --> 46:50.997
Go! Go! Go!
Today, gentleman, today!

46:52.915 --> 46:54.958
- Down, girlie!
- What, are you nuts?

47:04.760 --> 47:06.428
Stop! Please.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.597
I have clearance!
I have clearance!

47:09.014 --> 47:10.380
Bend down!

47:10.432 --> 47:11.881
You quit doing that!

47:11.933 --> 47:14.727
You think I'm doing this for
my own self-gratification?

47:30.075 --> 47:32.744
Go!

47:42.754 --> 47:45.048
No, Don't! Stop!

47:45.340 --> 47:46.258
Stephanie!

47:49.385 --> 47:50.678
They're killing him!

47:50.803 --> 47:52.221
Hold your fire!

47:53.264 --> 47:55.224
Damn it, stop!
Hold your fire!

47:55.516 --> 47:57.435
Hold your fire!

48:00.604 --> 48:02.690
Number Five alive!

48:04.066 --> 48:05.317
Stephanie!

48:05.359 --> 48:07.110
Number Five,
I'm sorry.

48:08.278 --> 48:10.905
Steph-an-ia...

48:11.197 --> 48:13.022
You're paralyzing him.

48:13.074 --> 48:16.661
I cut all his power. You can
load it on the truck now.

48:16.713 --> 48:18.413
What the hell
is the matter with you...

48:18.538 --> 48:20.206
you four-eyed idiot.

48:20.498 --> 48:22.187
What an asshole.

48:22.239 --> 48:23.876
I heard that.

48:24.001 --> 48:27.004
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Where are you taking him?

48:27.056 --> 48:28.380
Okay, I want you guys to...

48:28.432 --> 48:29.371
He's not being a him.

48:29.423 --> 48:32.384
It's only being wires and several
mechanisms and other such...

48:32.436 --> 48:33.667
machine type apparatus...

48:33.719 --> 48:36.805
<i>for the Pete of sake.
The sake of Pete...</i>

48:36.857 --> 48:38.922
No, you have to turn
him back on.

48:38.974 --> 48:41.351
He was talking before
like a real person.

48:41.403 --> 48:42.425
Couldn't you see that?

48:42.477 --> 48:44.937
Look, lady, all I could see was that
something mechanical...

48:44.989 --> 48:46.689
is screwed up and
I'm going to fix it, okay?

48:46.741 --> 48:48.566
Ok, fine! You fix it,
Einstein.

48:48.618 --> 48:50.057
I plan to.

48:50.109 --> 48:51.809
And it's Crosby.
Newton Crosby.

48:51.861 --> 48:53.404
- Stephanie Speck.
- Nice meeting you.

48:53.456 --> 48:54.395
Same here.

48:54.447 --> 48:55.813
- Ben? Ben?
- Sir! Stat!

48:55.865 --> 48:57.825
I want you to go with Number Five
and make sure they do not...

48:57.877 --> 48:59.410
switch off the memory.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

48:59.462 --> 49:00.786
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.

49:00.838 --> 49:02.402
Bye-bye, goofy woman.

49:02.454 --> 49:05.123
I enjoyed repeatedly throwing
you to the ground.

49:05.175 --> 49:06.875
No mistake.
Stat.

49:08.376 --> 49:10.420
You can call me
if you want to.

49:10.472 --> 49:11.619
Call you?

49:11.671 --> 49:13.340
To let me know
if Number Five's okay.

49:14.466 --> 49:16.093
Okay, maybe I will.

49:16.301 --> 49:18.719
Well, don't do me
any favors, Jack.

49:27.853 --> 49:28.761
So there we are.

49:28.813 --> 49:30.554
We're right on top of
Mount St. Helen's...

49:30.606 --> 49:33.734
- and we've got two flat tires.
- Two, that's bad.

49:33.786 --> 49:35.778
Now Hazel's running around
the parking lot.

49:35.830 --> 49:37.362
Hazel.

49:37.737 --> 49:38.822
<i>She's waving
her credit card...</i>

49:41.199 --> 49:42.617
It's life.
It's life.

49:42.659 --> 49:45.537
That is very funny
American name, Hazel.

49:45.745 --> 49:48.706
Well, It's sure not one you
can hear much anymore.

49:48.998 --> 49:50.625
I never heard it
before I met her.

49:50.917 --> 49:53.628
All except for witch hazel,
who I think she's named after.

49:54.087 --> 49:58.048
- I thought it was a nut.
- That's an old name.

49:58.340 --> 49:59.591
It's an old family name.

49:59.842 --> 50:01.218
They were from
some place in Europe...

50:01.468 --> 50:04.388
and there's always a Hazel in it.
In her family.

50:04.888 --> 50:07.766
I guess there's always some
Hazel in Europe.

50:10.519 --> 50:14.689
She's running around trying
to buy somebody's spare tire.

50:14.730 --> 50:17.900
She's showing people her ID's
to prove the checks are good...

50:17.952 --> 50:19.944
like a branch of our bank
where they could check.

50:21.446 --> 50:25.032
She was even trying to swap some
souvenirs when she was gotten.

50:25.616 --> 50:27.910
All of which were made from
the ashes of the volcano...

50:29.203 --> 50:31.580
Did you get a piece of ash?

50:34.916 --> 50:37.002
So, of course nobody's going to sell
her a spare tire...

50:37.054 --> 50:39.196
after what we just told
them happened to us.

50:39.248 --> 50:41.339
Especially the way
she was telling them.

50:41.715 --> 50:43.508
And she was trying to convince
them I wasn't a bad driver...

50:43.842 --> 50:45.093
which I'm not.

50:45.343 --> 50:47.929
But, she was doing it by telling
them how thin the road is.

50:47.981 --> 50:50.514
You know, and how curvy and
how many rocks there were...

50:50.566 --> 50:51.974
and how big
and sharp they are.

50:52.266 --> 50:54.059
And all the time I know
what these people are thinking.

50:54.351 --> 50:56.187
They gotta drive down
the same road...

51:31.470 --> 51:32.930
- Sir?
- Yes, sir?

51:33.138 --> 51:34.431
Sir?

51:34.890 --> 51:37.059
Oh, my goodness gracious!

51:37.309 --> 51:38.936
It can't shoot us with
that laser, can it?

51:38.977 --> 51:40.677
I am not knowing.

51:40.729 --> 51:43.731
- Would he kill me if I stopped?
- Who is to say?

51:43.783 --> 51:45.400
Would he kill me
if I don't stop?

51:45.452 --> 51:47.485
Again I am shrugging.

51:47.537 --> 51:49.153
I'm stopping.

51:51.114 --> 51:52.229
Good choice.

51:52.281 --> 51:54.951
Number Five furious,
livid, perturbed.

51:56.536 --> 51:58.913
Hold it right there.

52:00.164 --> 52:02.374
Colt 45.
Semi automatic.

52:03.417 --> 52:04.949
Play Doh.

52:05.001 --> 52:06.002
What do we do now?

52:06.253 --> 52:09.881
I don't know about you, but
I'm planning to scream and run.

52:10.966 --> 52:12.050
Good answer.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.436
What is he doing?

53:00.596 --> 53:02.181
There it goes
Very good.

53:02.931 --> 53:04.266
You earned that one.

53:22.241 --> 53:24.577
Hi, honey!
What is for dinner?

53:46.515 --> 53:47.891
Bingo!

53:55.564 --> 53:57.503
<i>Practice, Easy Three,
to third and fourth.</i>

53:57.555 --> 53:59.443
<i>Lucky's seventh and
Pacer in the rear.</i>

53:59.777 --> 54:02.696
<i>Now it's Double Trouble making
a move on the outside rail...</i>

54:02.748 --> 54:05.516
<i>and Practice right behind.
Jimmy's Folly is calling...</i>

54:05.568 --> 54:08.284
<i>That's the serpent and the devil...
same on him.</i>

54:08.785 --> 54:10.120
<i>And the devil is the...</i>

55:02.753 --> 55:03.879
Ready, aim!

55:05.797 --> 55:07.090
What happened?

55:09.801 --> 55:12.179
I hope you took the grass
out of the glove compartment.

55:13.096 --> 55:15.140
Anything wrong, officer?

55:16.141 --> 55:18.393
There's gotta be a logical
explanation for all of this.

55:18.977 --> 55:21.645
Maybe, if it was programmed
to think it was alive...

55:21.697 --> 55:23.147
then it could act alive.

55:23.189 --> 55:25.816
Maybe you've created another
Frankfurter's monster.

55:26.567 --> 55:28.694
Do I look like the kind of a man
who can actually hear his...

55:28.746 --> 55:31.562
Howard I think that something
incredible is going on.

55:31.614 --> 55:33.532
What's going on is that we've
got a red alert on your hands?

55:33.584 --> 55:34.492
No, it's not dangerous.

55:34.533 --> 55:36.702
We just have to find
Number Five, get some answers.

55:36.754 --> 55:38.110
There's only one answer.

55:38.162 --> 55:40.080
All right, blast it off the
face of the earth, right?

55:40.330 --> 55:42.624
Doctor... how many kids you got?

55:43.416 --> 55:44.240
None.

55:44.292 --> 55:45.376
Well, let me tell you
something, Doctor.

55:45.460 --> 55:48.630
I got three of them.
Three dandy little Schroeders.

55:48.682 --> 55:50.678
And I want them to be adults,
not barbecued.

55:50.730 --> 55:52.623
So don't you give me
any of your bullshit.

55:52.675 --> 55:54.803
That having been said, I think
I've got to alert the media.

55:54.855 --> 55:56.304
Now Schroeder's going to handle
this from now on...

55:56.513 --> 55:57.679
and you stay
at your terminal.

55:57.721 --> 55:59.004
Howard, this is ridiculous.

55:59.056 --> 56:00.630
Think of it as
a full-scale field test.

56:00.682 --> 56:02.341
Leave your terminal and
you're out of a job.

56:02.393 --> 56:04.019
Howard, we are going to have
to put up some roadblocks...

56:04.311 --> 56:05.729
and I'm going to
need some Hueys.

56:05.781 --> 56:06.720
Some what?

56:06.772 --> 56:08.982
Helicopters, Howard.
Jesus Christ!

56:09.191 --> 56:11.652
- I thought they were choppers.
- Now they're called Hueys.

56:11.704 --> 56:13.737
Well, why wasn't I notified?

56:18.533 --> 56:20.076
Okay, this is the plan...

56:32.463 --> 56:34.381
- Stephanie Speck.
- Yes.

56:34.433 --> 56:35.246
We're from KJMB News.

56:35.298 --> 56:38.009
Can you please tell us something
about the Nova robot?

56:38.061 --> 56:39.803
- Were you scared?
- No, no.

56:40.262 --> 56:41.805
<i>Did he try to molest
you in any way?</i>

56:42.055 --> 56:43.807
<i>No, he's not that kind
of a robot.</i>

56:43.890 --> 56:46.935
<i>Do you know that there's a $25
thousand reward for anyone that turns it in?</i>

56:46.987 --> 56:48.343
<i>No, I don't know anything
about it.</i>

56:48.395 --> 56:50.605
<i>I don't know where he is.
Please, leave me alone.</i>

56:50.657 --> 56:51.897
<i>Why didn't you go
to the police?</i>

56:52.690 --> 56:54.483
You know where it is.

56:55.943 --> 56:59.739
For 25 thousand dollars I'm damn
well going to know where it is too.

57:07.747 --> 57:09.330
Frank?

57:11.458 --> 57:13.209
Is that you, Frank?

57:13.752 --> 57:16.004
I'm warning you,
I'm armed and dangerous.

57:20.592 --> 57:23.678
Disguise, camouflage. Hi!

57:23.730 --> 57:26.765
Number Five!
You got away?

57:27.015 --> 57:27.838
Yep.

57:27.890 --> 57:29.308
You can't stay here!
They'll find you!

57:30.309 --> 57:33.228
Stephanie.
Changed color.

57:37.524 --> 57:42.488
Attractive,
nice software.

57:42.613 --> 57:45.261
You sure don't talk
like a machine.

57:45.313 --> 57:47.444
Alive, Stephanie.
Number Five alive.

57:47.496 --> 57:49.412
Yes, I know you think
you're alive...

57:49.464 --> 57:51.329
but those guys who built
you say no way.

57:51.829 --> 57:53.414
I don't know what
to think anymore.

57:53.623 --> 57:54.916
I know it's not safe
for you here.

57:55.083 --> 57:56.542
Go on.
Get out of here. Go on!

57:59.003 --> 58:03.216
Solitude, isolation. Alone.

58:03.590 --> 58:06.218
Number Five, come on!

58:06.968 --> 58:08.918
Lonely bum.

58:08.970 --> 58:10.754
Number five, please.

58:10.806 --> 58:14.226
If I went to jail, who would
take care of my animals?

58:14.278 --> 58:15.852
You sure wouldn't.

58:16.728 --> 58:18.094
What are you doing?

58:18.146 --> 58:21.191
"A can of soup.
A meal in itself."

58:22.858 --> 58:25.986
All right, you can stay,
but just for tonight.

58:26.112 --> 58:26.852
Excellent.

58:26.904 --> 58:28.531
If they catch you
I don't know you.

58:29.365 --> 58:30.658
You got it.

58:30.866 --> 58:32.076
Okay, Ben, let's do it.

58:32.827 --> 58:35.287
This is the very first vehicle
I've stolen in the US of A.

58:35.339 --> 58:36.414
Me, too. It's kind of exciting,
Isn't it?

58:36.622 --> 58:38.582
With excitement like this,
who is needing enemas?

58:38.634 --> 58:39.864
Look Ben, we're doing
the right thing.

58:39.916 --> 58:42.711
If they trash Number Five, we'll
never find out what happened.

58:43.712 --> 58:45.672
Dr. Marner!

58:45.714 --> 58:47.507
I knew you would try this.

58:47.632 --> 58:48.706
You're not going
to make it, fellas.

58:48.758 --> 58:51.219
There are soldiers out there
with bazooka's and choppers...

58:51.271 --> 58:52.835
or whatever the hell
they call them now.

58:52.887 --> 58:56.141
We've got to try anyway. You're
a scientist, you understand.

58:56.193 --> 58:57.975
I'm a business man.
I'm not a scientist anymore.

58:58.225 --> 58:59.226
Damn you, Howard.

58:59.476 --> 59:01.812
20 years ago you would have
chauffeured us in this situation.

59:01.937 --> 59:03.303
Well, times have changed.

59:03.355 --> 59:05.639
Because that was then
and this is now.

59:05.691 --> 59:07.860
All right, now come on.
Let's get back upstairs.

59:08.569 --> 59:10.154
What the heck, Newton.

59:10.404 --> 59:12.823
Let us punch the sack.
Tomorrow is the next day.

59:13.407 --> 59:14.867
No.

59:16.325 --> 59:17.869
No.

59:18.077 --> 59:19.912
No. I'm going.

59:21.414 --> 59:22.999
Howard, shoot me
if you have to.

59:23.051 --> 59:24.042
Don't think I won't.

59:24.125 --> 59:25.376
Come on, Howard,
you know you're bluffing.

59:25.428 --> 59:27.045
Lord Rama, Lord Rama.

59:27.128 --> 59:28.796
Lord Rama,
Lord Rama, grant my wish.

59:31.049 --> 59:32.039
All right, I'm bluffing.

59:32.091 --> 59:34.217
Ok, thank you. Come on, Ben,
let's get out of here.

59:34.269 --> 59:35.552
Right. Very good.

59:37.804 --> 59:40.766
It doesn't matter anyway, the
doors are electronically sealed.

59:41.141 --> 59:41.975
Don't be too sure.

59:46.938 --> 59:48.648
Then you'll have
to drive over me.

59:48.700 --> 59:50.113
That's the way
it's gotta be.

59:50.165 --> 59:51.526
This is going to be
very messy.

59:51.610 --> 59:54.236
This is how I get
the big bucks.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.269
Yeah.

01:01:00.258 --> 01:01:02.009
Oh, very good.

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:03.928
Great.

01:01:04.137 --> 01:01:06.304
Oh! Hey, thanks.

01:01:06.805 --> 01:01:09.182
Okay, turn off the TV.

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:11.059
- It's time for bed.
- No.

01:01:17.524 --> 01:01:20.152
No, turn off the TV.
It's time for bed.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:24.613
Come on Steph, lighten up.
Let's give it a whirl.

01:01:24.665 --> 01:01:26.323
- Hey!
- Ya!

01:01:27.408 --> 01:01:30.911
- Listen, you, it's three a.m.
- It's early.

01:01:31.162 --> 01:01:32.569
I mean, don't you ever
get enough?

01:01:32.621 --> 01:01:35.144
Wrestling, roller derby,
Jimmy Swaggert...

01:01:35.196 --> 01:01:37.668
The Three Stooges.
Give it a rest, will ya?

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.296
Larry, Curly, Moe.

01:01:41.421 --> 01:01:44.758
Hey, know what?
You're not a bad dancer.

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:46.468
Dancing fool.

01:01:49.971 --> 01:01:51.598
- Big finish.
- Right.

01:01:51.931 --> 01:01:54.392
And then I'm going to bed
and in the morning...

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:56.603
you have to find yourself
a new home.

01:01:56.655 --> 01:01:59.813
This home.
Stephanie home.

01:01:59.865 --> 01:02:01.304
Number Five home.

01:02:01.356 --> 01:02:04.276
Oh, Number Five, you don't know
what you're saying.

01:02:04.328 --> 01:02:06.445
Number Five know.

01:02:13.827 --> 01:02:15.829
"More than a woman."

01:02:18.081 --> 01:02:20.875
"More than a woman to me."

01:02:20.927 --> 01:02:22.335
Oh, Number Five.

01:02:27.173 --> 01:02:29.300
"More than a woman to me."

01:02:39.726 --> 01:02:41.728
<i>I'll croon</i>

01:02:42.479 --> 01:02:44.773
<i>A little song
About the moon</i>

01:02:46.358 --> 01:02:49.236
<i>And when I'm finished
With my crooning</i>

01:02:49.695 --> 01:02:51.571
<i>On my knees I'll fall</i>

01:02:51.822 --> 01:02:54.573
<i>My life, my love, my all</i>

01:02:56.409 --> 01:03:00.579
Okay, to make these
golden fluffy pancakes...

01:03:00.705 --> 01:03:04.542
add flour, milk...

01:03:04.594 --> 01:03:06.001
and eggs.

01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:15.301
Mix thoroughly.

01:03:21.057 --> 01:03:22.517
Still lumpy.

01:03:28.815 --> 01:03:30.232
Marvelous.

01:03:31.191 --> 01:03:33.235
For crisp, yet moist
potatoes...

01:03:33.694 --> 01:03:36.280
brown on one side,
then turn over.

01:03:39.867 --> 01:03:42.411
This will be
some good slop.

01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:44.705
Is something burning?

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:47.583
- Morning.
- Oh! Number Five!

01:03:47.635 --> 01:03:49.824
- Good morning.
- Sleep well?

01:03:49.876 --> 01:03:52.128
You're making me breakfast,
aren't you?

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.629
Pancakes surprise.

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:56.466
Oh, Number Five,
you're so sweet.

01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:59.469
Oh, no.

01:04:01.387 --> 01:04:03.973
It's the revenge
of the Mutations.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.684
Listen, why don't you turn that
stove off and I'll be right back.

01:04:08.352 --> 01:04:10.854
Wait!
It'll get cold.

01:04:13.774 --> 01:04:14.983
What are you
doing here, creep?

01:04:15.035 --> 01:04:16.433
Oh, good morning.

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:18.487
I saw you on TV last night
on the news.

01:04:18.779 --> 01:04:20.238
Yeah, I'm a real
big celebrity.

01:04:20.655 --> 01:04:22.449
You know there's
a reward out for that robot?

01:04:22.574 --> 01:04:24.200
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

01:04:24.658 --> 01:04:25.951
No, I don't know
anything about it.

01:04:25.993 --> 01:04:27.328
Why don't you get off
my property?

01:04:38.923 --> 01:04:40.883
- Steph...
- Leave me alone.

01:04:41.092 --> 01:04:42.509
- Where is it?
- It's not here.

01:04:42.884 --> 01:04:46.096
- Get out or I'll call the cops.
- Stephanie, breakfast.

01:04:46.429 --> 01:04:49.099
Pancakes, hash browns.

01:04:49.891 --> 01:04:52.508
Twenty five thousand dollars.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.146
Don't worry, we'll split it.
Twenty for me and five for you.

01:04:55.198 --> 01:04:57.232
Listen, you gotta talk
computer to him.

01:04:57.357 --> 01:04:58.233
Tell him exactly what
you're doing...

01:04:58.566 --> 01:05:00.526
exactly where you're going, or
he's not going to move an inch.

01:05:00.776 --> 01:05:02.778
Number Five, this is Frank.

01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:07.449
How, Robot.
Me friend.

01:05:08.492 --> 01:05:10.494
No, talk computer,
not Apache.

01:05:11.036 --> 01:05:13.956
Fresh O.J.?
Not from concentrate.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.836
Thanks.

01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:21.421
Listen, what do you say
we jump in my car...

01:05:21.473 --> 01:05:23.172
we'll take a ride.
I'll take you home.

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:25.717
Tell him where home is.

01:05:25.967 --> 01:05:27.760
Home is Nova.

01:05:28.428 --> 01:05:29.679
Nova! No!

01:05:29.971 --> 01:05:31.368
No disassemble!

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:32.765
Number Five, run!

01:05:32.807 --> 01:05:34.559
Come on, treads,
don't fail me now.

01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:37.707
- Run, get away now!
- Get off me!

01:05:37.759 --> 01:05:40.345
You tricked me,
you little bitch!

01:05:40.397 --> 01:05:42.774
Does this mean I don't
get my five thousand dollars?

01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:44.985
Forget it! Forget it!

01:05:45.402 --> 01:05:47.946
He can go thirty miles an hour,
you big stupid jerk.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.354
I'll show you, how
stupid I am.

01:05:49.406 --> 01:05:52.325
- Guess who's going to help me catch it.
- No, I'd rather die first!

01:05:52.377 --> 01:05:53.493
Where the hell is my car?

01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:57.288
Hi.

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:03.826
Piece of cake.

01:06:03.878 --> 01:06:06.130
Oh, my God!
My car!

01:06:06.505 --> 01:06:09.467
- Oh, way to go, Number Five.
- Uh-oh!

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:14.763
Oh, my God, no!

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.473
Number Five, look out!

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.395
"Say Pilgrim, that like to
parted my hair."

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.774
"If you wanna play rough,
I can sure oblige ya."

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:30.111
How can he do that?

01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:39.401
"Frankie...

01:06:39.453 --> 01:06:43.415
you broke the unwritten law.
You ratted on your friends.

01:06:44.249 --> 01:06:46.042
And when you do that, Frankie...

01:06:46.094 --> 01:06:47.836
your enemies don't respect you...

01:06:47.888 --> 01:06:50.259
you got no friends no more.

01:06:50.311 --> 01:06:52.632
You got nobody Frankie."

01:06:53.383 --> 01:06:54.842
Pretty good, huh?

01:06:55.551 --> 01:06:57.679
Unbelievable.

01:06:58.262 --> 01:06:59.639
Look out!

01:07:00.848 --> 01:07:02.684
How about that,
a goddamn robot?

01:07:04.977 --> 01:07:07.230
Stephanie, get off me!

01:07:07.604 --> 01:07:09.439
Stephanie, that's it.

01:07:10.232 --> 01:07:12.442
No!
Not disassemble Stephanie.

01:07:16.363 --> 01:07:17.572
No!

01:07:41.721 --> 01:07:44.264
I'm calling Nova, and I'm
calling the cops.

01:07:44.472 --> 01:07:46.099
And as for you, you
little pain-in-the-neck...

01:07:46.307 --> 01:07:48.935
you better not come crawling
back to me, because now it's over!

01:07:49.227 --> 01:07:50.228
Good.

01:07:51.312 --> 01:07:52.303
Okay, come on.

01:07:52.355 --> 01:07:54.024
They're gonna be after you.
We gotta get out here, now.

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:01.697
So now I am having no job
to speak about.

01:08:01.905 --> 01:08:03.574
I will have to smack
the sidewalk.

01:08:03.741 --> 01:08:05.409
I'm not going to let it happen.
You're not going to get fired...

01:08:05.617 --> 01:08:06.910
I'm not going to get fired...

01:08:06.994 --> 01:08:09.204
because we're going to find
Number Five intact.

01:08:09.256 --> 01:08:10.070
Very good.

01:08:10.122 --> 01:08:11.623
<i>That's right, Howard.</i>

01:08:11.749 --> 01:08:13.667
- It's Scrotum?
- Schoreder.

01:08:14.209 --> 01:08:15.158
Same thing.

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:16.118
<i>Now all roads are blocked</i>

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:19.006
<i>her only chance is
a back road into the hills.</i>

01:08:19.058 --> 01:08:21.174
<i>We'll concentrate our search there.</i>

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:27.430
Where the hell are we?

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:29.349
"New York City".

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:31.517
No, I don't think so.
Try the other side.

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:32.518
Ok.

01:08:33.978 --> 01:08:35.772
Oh. Texaco.

01:08:36.022 --> 01:08:37.023
Great.

01:08:37.482 --> 01:08:40.067
Well, I'm lost.
I don't know where to go.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.277
- Strategy.
- What about it?

01:08:42.328 --> 01:08:43.819
Need some, quick.

01:08:44.071 --> 01:08:46.782
Right, what we need is somebody
to make those bozos listen.

01:08:48.033 --> 01:08:50.035
- Not bozos.
- What?

01:08:50.087 --> 01:08:51.243
One bozo.

01:08:51.453 --> 01:08:53.537
Newton Crosby, PhD.

01:08:53.788 --> 01:08:56.122
Hey, malfunction, he's the enemy.
He can't help.

01:08:56.874 --> 01:08:58.073
Couldn't hurt.

01:08:58.125 --> 01:09:00.127
You know, I know why Number
Five took a liking to her.

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:03.673
If it did have that capability,
which it doesn't, but if it did.

01:09:03.725 --> 01:09:06.040
I mean, I think she's pretty,
don't you think?

01:09:06.091 --> 01:09:09.261
I am thinking she's a virgin.
Or at least she used to be.

01:09:09.804 --> 01:09:11.180
<i>Hello Crosby.</i>

01:09:11.305 --> 01:09:12.379
I think it's Howard.

01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:15.015
<i>I know you're listening,
so pick up the mike.</i>

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.102
This is Crosby.
How's your back, Howard?

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:18.635
Just hunky-dory, thanks.

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:21.064
I just swore out some warrants
for your arrest.

01:09:21.147 --> 01:09:22.055
Good golly.

01:09:22.107 --> 01:09:25.276
<i>But because I'm a nice guy, I'm
going to give you one last chance.</i>

01:09:25.568 --> 01:09:27.987
<i>I got a phone call from that loony
in the lunch wagon.</i>

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:29.238
<i>She wants to see you.</i>

01:09:29.948 --> 01:09:31.981
<i>- Only you.
- She does?</i>

01:09:32.033 --> 01:09:34.535
Oh! Her pants are blazing for
you Newton Crosby.

01:09:34.993 --> 01:09:37.997
Will you grow up. I'll be there,
Howard, on one condition.

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:39.372
No Schroeder.
Is it a deal?

01:09:39.456 --> 01:09:40.624
<i>It's a deal.</i>

01:09:40.916 --> 01:09:43.252
<i>- Where does she want to meet?
- The Black Lion Inn.</i>

01:09:53.845 --> 01:09:55.179
Good luck, sir.

01:10:18.118 --> 01:10:19.369
Hi.

01:10:20.412 --> 01:10:22.153
He's hidden far away.

01:10:22.205 --> 01:10:23.790
He's scared of you guys,
you know.

01:10:25.417 --> 01:10:26.959
Do I get him or not?

01:10:27.001 --> 01:10:29.170
First we talk... inside.

01:10:32.923 --> 01:10:35.207
My ex-boyfriend used to
bring me here.

01:10:35.259 --> 01:10:37.678
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Fine, good to see you.

01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:40.389
- Yeah, ex. So what?
- Ah, nothing.

01:10:42.808 --> 01:10:44.685
Okay, here's the deal.

01:10:44.934 --> 01:10:47.187
Number Five is alive.

01:10:48.188 --> 01:10:52.192
I mean, he is really alive,
like you and me, you see?

01:10:52.244 --> 01:10:54.225
I understand. They can seem
quite life-like...

01:10:54.277 --> 01:10:57.197
but they're still machines.
Just like your stereo...

01:10:57.249 --> 01:10:58.474
or your vacuum cleaner.

01:10:58.526 --> 01:10:59.699
No, I know he's a machine.

01:10:59.824 --> 01:11:02.233
You're a machine, I'm a
machine. We're alive.

01:11:02.285 --> 01:11:05.496
How it happens, who the hell
knows. But it has happened.

01:11:05.548 --> 01:11:06.997
Okay.

01:11:07.456 --> 01:11:11.710
Believe me, I'm not against the
idea that happen, but you see...

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.088
I built the machine from scratch.

01:11:14.922 --> 01:11:16.965
And alive, alive...

01:11:17.132 --> 01:11:18.165
it doesn't compute.

01:11:18.217 --> 01:11:23.012
I know. It's not your everyday
event. But somehow, it's true.

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:28.267
As Guerrero steps to the plate.
The pitch...

01:11:29.143 --> 01:11:32.563
and it's a long line drive
to deep left center.

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:34.982
Hyde is going back for it!
He's...

01:11:40.237 --> 01:11:42.781
Robot alert!
Number Five located.

01:11:43.407 --> 01:11:46.201
Engage in capture,
do not destroy.

01:11:47.869 --> 01:11:49.871
Have you thought about
what you're doing?

01:11:49.923 --> 01:11:51.780
Trying to hide something
like this?

01:11:51.832 --> 01:11:55.836
If you want to help Number Five,
let me have it back.

01:11:55.888 --> 01:11:58.129
It's malfunctioning.
It needs to be repaired.

01:11:58.181 --> 01:12:00.798
Life is not a malfunction.

01:12:06.262 --> 01:12:08.472
Number Five axis four twenty-nine.

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:09.807
Stay where you are.

01:12:11.308 --> 01:12:14.562
- Strike three.
- Number Five, stay where you are.

01:12:16.688 --> 01:12:19.774
Number one,
you're out of there.

01:12:22.569 --> 01:12:24.529
Number Five, stay
where you are.

01:12:25.822 --> 01:12:26.823
Oh, my gosh.

01:12:32.495 --> 01:12:33.246
Tools.

01:12:33.455 --> 01:12:34.580
Hammer! Axe!

01:12:36.248 --> 01:12:37.197
Rope!

01:12:37.249 --> 01:12:40.127
Three quarter inch double-braid.
Perfecto!

01:12:41.003 --> 01:12:44.006
"Escaped Robot Fights for
His Life. Film at Eleven."

01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:45.507
Target in sight. Fire!

01:12:49.219 --> 01:12:51.971
Capture and hold.
Elevation sixteen degrees.

01:12:52.722 --> 01:12:56.767
Visibility five feet,
two feet, no feet.

01:12:56.819 --> 01:13:00.813
Hey, laser lips! Your mama
was a snowblower.

01:13:17.788 --> 01:13:20.582
That wraps you up,
you rascally robot.

01:13:23.627 --> 01:13:27.172
Target located. Elevation
sixteen degrees. Fire!

01:13:27.963 --> 01:13:29.215
Holy moley!

01:13:33.469 --> 01:13:35.888
- Elevation 22 degrees.
- Dumbo!

01:13:36.347 --> 01:13:37.723
Axis lost. Seventeen...

01:13:43.646 --> 01:13:44.803
Temper, temper!

01:13:44.855 --> 01:13:46.231
Three degrees. Fire!

01:13:53.154 --> 01:13:54.155
Oley!

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.994
Don't fire.
Don't light a match.

01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:03.373
Well, when you gotta go
don't squeeze the charming.

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:28.261
Oh, no.
Nova!

01:14:28.313 --> 01:14:29.178
Let me tell you something.

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:31.389
I don't like these Nova guys
anymore than you do.

01:14:31.441 --> 01:14:33.818
In fact, I don't care if they
ever get Number Five back...

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:34.976
but I want to see it.

01:14:35.028 --> 01:14:38.156
If I show where he is,
do I have your word...

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:39.892
you will not experiment on him?

01:14:39.944 --> 01:14:41.718
You will not flip his switches?

01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:43.382
And you will not take him apart?

01:14:43.434 --> 01:14:44.995
Absolutely.
You have my word.

01:14:47.122 --> 01:14:48.832
He's out back.
I'll take you to him.

01:14:48.915 --> 01:14:50.792
If you are ready, young lady,
you can take me, too.

01:14:50.844 --> 01:14:51.658
Schroeder!

01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:53.420
Terrific job, Crosby.
Thanks for the help.

01:14:53.472 --> 01:14:54.880
- No, I had nothing...
- You bastard!

01:14:55.047 --> 01:14:56.506
- I'm not...
- You're liar.

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:57.507
No I didn't know...

01:15:00.217 --> 01:15:01.886
Stephanie, a trap!

01:15:01.969 --> 01:15:03.637
Nova! Depart!

01:15:04.221 --> 01:15:05.348
<i>Look out!</i>

01:15:17.025 --> 01:15:18.318
Here's your table sir.

01:15:18.652 --> 01:15:21.571
- You little bastard!
- Paco, please. No autographs, sir.

01:15:22.989 --> 01:15:25.575
Come Stephanie.
We be German.

01:15:29.371 --> 01:15:30.246
Bastard!

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.033
Stop!

01:15:36.085 --> 01:15:38.045
- Stop!
- Go, go, go, go!

01:15:47.388 --> 01:15:50.975
Great idea. Newton Crosby,
Ph. Dork.

01:15:58.314 --> 01:16:00.692
- What are you doing?
- Keep driving.

01:16:12.536 --> 01:16:15.163
- Step on it!
- Okay, hold on.

01:16:24.756 --> 01:16:27.426
I have had it!
I have had it!

01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:31.303
- This was a precision operation.
- Schroeder, you set me up!

01:16:31.355 --> 01:16:33.264
Crosby, I'm telling you
right now...

01:16:33.639 --> 01:16:37.143
this little fart of a robot is
beginning to give me red ass.

01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:40.552
Where the hell
are those other robots?

01:16:40.604 --> 01:16:43.482
They should have cut
Number Five to pieces by now.

01:16:47.944 --> 01:16:50.030
- Where are you guys going?
- Who's asking?

01:16:50.082 --> 01:16:52.037
A wise guy.

01:16:52.089 --> 01:16:53.992
Excuse this.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.577
And this.

01:16:59.664 --> 01:17:01.499
<i>Hey, Cut it out!</i>

01:17:07.296 --> 01:17:08.589
<i>Numskulls.</i>

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.774
Cars. Dumb machines.

01:17:28.775 --> 01:17:29.901
That creep.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.737
I should have known. Every time
I think a guy's gonna be okay...

01:17:32.789 --> 01:17:34.270
turns out to be a real jerk.

01:17:34.322 --> 01:17:35.865
They are all alike!
All of them!

01:17:36.199 --> 01:17:37.408
Stephanie...

01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:39.494
Well, the next time they mess
with us, we're gonna kick ass.

01:17:39.827 --> 01:17:42.454
Kick ass?
Donkey, mule, burro...

01:17:42.871 --> 01:17:44.956
One of them comes near you,
you blast them!

01:17:45.248 --> 01:17:46.958
Just burn his butt
with your laser.

01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:48.377
- Burn?
- Yeah!

01:17:49.628 --> 01:17:52.673
No!
No disassemble.

01:17:53.298 --> 01:17:56.218
Number Five, come on,
they deserve it.

01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:57.761
Stephanie.

01:17:59.012 --> 01:18:00.763
Jesus, I'm sorry.

01:18:00.972 --> 01:18:01.931
I just...

01:18:03.224 --> 01:18:05.977
I don't know what
to do anymore.

01:18:06.978 --> 01:18:08.729
Take heart little lady.

01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:11.148
I'll fix their wagon.

01:18:32.377 --> 01:18:36.297
Well, the cat is dragged in a sight
for four eyes that is for sure.

01:18:36.349 --> 01:18:37.871
You look dreadful.

01:18:37.923 --> 01:18:39.341
What happened?
Where is Number five?

01:18:39.508 --> 01:18:42.261
I saw something incredible.
I saw three robots...

01:18:42.313 --> 01:18:43.835
totally re-programmed in
ten minutes.

01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:46.223
I saw Number Five crash
trough a wall, grab the girl...

01:18:46.275 --> 01:18:47.339
I think he was rescuing her...

01:18:47.391 --> 01:18:49.424
crash trough another wall
and drive away.

01:18:49.476 --> 01:18:51.885
- It was screaming her name.
- Now, wait a minute.

01:18:51.937 --> 01:18:54.292
If you're thinking what I'm
thinking you're thinking...

01:18:54.344 --> 01:18:56.956
then you are thinking that
female chick is some sort of...

01:18:57.008 --> 01:18:59.569
- super hacker or something.
- Sure. She's a super hacker.

01:18:59.621 --> 01:19:00.888
First, she cracks
the Nova access code...

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.103
then, she deciphers
for the language...

01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:04.490
I invented, all
while we were sitting in the bar.

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:08.014
- Which was great.
- Really? Tell me. What happened?

01:19:08.066 --> 01:19:10.538
We were interfacing, operating
on the same wavelength...

01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:11.706
Very good, my advice helped, then.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:15.250
What happened, did she stick
her tongue down your throat?

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:16.074
No, no.

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:18.253
Come on, sit in the van and tell me.
I want to know, yes sir.

01:19:18.305 --> 01:19:19.296
Yes! Come on, Newton.

01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:20.370
Oh, my goodness.

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:23.634
I am sporting
a tremendous woody right now.

01:19:23.686 --> 01:19:24.885
Come on, tell me Newton.

01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:28.597
Our hands came really
close to touching.

01:19:28.649 --> 01:19:30.640
And she said I had really
nice eyes.

01:19:30.681 --> 01:19:31.682
Yeah, you have really brown eyes.

01:19:31.807 --> 01:19:34.977
And then Schroeder came in with
his Gestapo and ruined it all.

01:19:35.029 --> 01:19:37.255
Those bunch of
male-type organs.

01:19:37.307 --> 01:19:39.482
- Right.
- That's what I'm meaning.

01:19:40.274 --> 01:19:41.265
That's the RF receiver.

01:19:41.317 --> 01:19:43.340
It's still tuned to Number Five's
wavelength, right?

01:19:43.392 --> 01:19:45.363
Yes, but only if it is less than
twenty feet away.

01:19:47.823 --> 01:19:50.283
Hello, bozos.

01:19:51.409 --> 01:19:57.082
<i>Guys, it's Howard. If you don't
return my van in 15 minutes...</i>

01:19:59.084 --> 01:20:02.128
Benjamin Jhabutiyah,
delete.

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.172
No, wait!
Rethink yourself.

01:20:04.224 --> 01:20:06.216
Exit, depart, leave.

01:20:07.007 --> 01:20:08.509
Hear my dust, Newton Crosby!

01:20:08.561 --> 01:20:09.551
Let us break wind!

01:20:11.845 --> 01:20:14.974
Newton Crosby,
no run, no talk.

01:20:15.474 --> 01:20:16.934
Drive.

01:20:19.019 --> 01:20:21.188
Today, Crosby, today!

01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:40.206
Number Five?

01:20:42.208 --> 01:20:44.209
Number Five,
where are you?

01:20:56.763 --> 01:20:58.223
All right dipshit...

01:20:58.598 --> 01:21:00.507
where's Number Five?
What did you do to him?

01:21:00.559 --> 01:21:02.643
- You gotta control yourself just a tad.
- Hello.

01:21:03.769 --> 01:21:04.969
Hi.

01:21:05.021 --> 01:21:06.981
You kidnapped him?

01:21:07.023 --> 01:21:09.734
Kidnapped,
shanghaied, hijacked.

01:21:09.786 --> 01:21:11.652
Outstanding!

01:21:11.736 --> 01:21:13.988
Communicate!
Need input!

01:21:14.238 --> 01:21:16.740
I have questions,
queries, posers.

01:21:16.792 --> 01:21:19.190
- You and me, both.
- Well, good.

01:21:19.242 --> 01:21:22.996
You go up there, sit down,
look at the stars...

01:21:23.413 --> 01:21:26.583
talk to each other,
get to know each other...

01:21:26.635 --> 01:21:28.418
- man to man.
- Yes.

01:21:28.668 --> 01:21:31.546
Beautiful stars.
Better see.

01:21:32.005 --> 01:21:34.966
Beautiful stars.
Better see?

01:21:35.008 --> 01:21:35.957
Oh, my God.

01:21:36.009 --> 01:21:38.667
Are all geniuses as
stupid as you?

01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:41.200
He means it's a beautiful
view of the stars.

01:21:41.252 --> 01:21:43.682
I think he speaks very well
for a four day old.

01:21:46.352 --> 01:21:49.688
Come. Come.
Input! Input!

01:21:51.899 --> 01:21:53.650
Beautiful.

01:21:53.702 --> 01:21:55.350
Right.

01:21:55.401 --> 01:21:56.819
One more time,
from the top.

01:21:57.570 --> 01:21:58.905
Who is your programmer?

01:21:59.906 --> 01:22:01.658
Me.

01:22:05.578 --> 01:22:08.331
You rewired
all your switches.

01:22:08.831 --> 01:22:10.959
No wonder
you're malfunctioning.

01:22:13.127 --> 01:22:17.839
Switches are my switches.
Life not malfunction.

01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:20.842
Not malfunction.
I am alive.

01:22:21.343 --> 01:22:24.419
No, you're not!
You can't be.

01:22:24.471 --> 01:22:26.306
There's gotta be another
explanation.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:28.266
Okay! What?

01:22:32.144 --> 01:22:33.427
Sorry, time's up.

01:22:33.479 --> 01:22:35.690
Wait a minute,
I'm thinking.

01:22:41.195 --> 01:22:43.906
Could be any number
of mechanical possibilities.

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:46.117
Entrance of moisture
into the system.

01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:48.145
- Heat expansion.
- Try again.

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:50.120
- Vibration damage.
- No way Jose.

01:22:50.328 --> 01:22:52.330
- I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Okay.

01:22:53.081 --> 01:22:55.417
Then why did you
ignore your programming?

01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:58.586
Programming says "Destroy".

01:22:58.638 --> 01:23:00.964
Is disassemble.
Make dead.

01:23:01.798 --> 01:23:03.216
Number Five cannot.

01:23:03.268 --> 01:23:04.259
Why?

01:23:05.635 --> 01:23:07.585
Why cannot?

01:23:07.637 --> 01:23:09.888
Is wrong. Incorrect.

01:23:10.347 --> 01:23:14.132
Newton Crosby, PhD,
not know this?

01:23:14.184 --> 01:23:18.147
Well, of course I know it's wrong
to kill, but who told you?

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.734
I told me.

01:23:26.404 --> 01:23:30.022
<i>Pattycake, pattycake,
baker's man</i>

01:23:30.074 --> 01:23:33.776
<i>Bake me a cake
as fast as you can...</i>

01:23:33.828 --> 01:23:36.831
Here, I brought you some soup.
It's getting cold.

01:23:36.883 --> 01:23:38.791
- Thank you.
- Convinced yet?

01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:43.504
Well, I got one.

01:23:49.134 --> 01:23:51.762
<i>There we go.
Pattycake, Pattycake...</i>

01:23:52.554 --> 01:23:55.474
Number Five,
what do you make of this?

01:23:57.142 --> 01:23:58.602
Wood pulp?

01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:00.979
Plant, vegetable,
tomato.

01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:03.773
Water, salt,
monosodium glutamate.

01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:06.609
Okay. Thank you.

01:24:07.234 --> 01:24:09.153
Now you're talking
like a robot.

01:24:09.779 --> 01:24:12.740
And resemble,
look like...

01:24:14.784 --> 01:24:16.577
butterfly.

01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:18.162
Bird.

01:24:18.454 --> 01:24:20.664
- Maple leaf.
- Where?

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.086
Holy shit!

01:24:26.336 --> 01:24:29.506
No shit.
Where see shit?

01:24:32.342 --> 01:24:35.804
Ok, here's your oscillating
circuit. That's done right.

01:24:35.856 --> 01:24:37.086
And here's...

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:38.555
Now, why'd you do this?

01:24:38.597 --> 01:24:39.838
Why'd you do this?

01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:43.894
You shouldn't even
be operating if this goes into...

01:24:43.946 --> 01:24:45.396
Let me get my other one.

01:25:20.095 --> 01:25:21.513
I got it!

01:25:23.974 --> 01:25:24.965
I got it!

01:25:25.017 --> 01:25:26.643
All right, this is it!

01:25:27.477 --> 01:25:28.510
Now, listen close.

01:25:28.562 --> 01:25:30.345
There's a priest, a minister
and a rabbi.

01:25:30.397 --> 01:25:33.024
They're out playing golf and
they're trying to decide...

01:25:33.076 --> 01:25:34.066
how much to give to charity.

01:25:34.275 --> 01:25:36.267
So the priest says, we'll
draw a circle on the ground...

01:25:36.319 --> 01:25:38.279
we'll throw the money way up
in the air and whatever lands...

01:25:38.331 --> 01:25:39.780
inside the circle,
we give to charity.

01:25:39.822 --> 01:25:41.730
The minister says "no", we'll
draw a circle on the ground,

01:25:41.782 --> 01:25:44.493
we'll throw the money way up in the air
and whatever lands outside the circle...

01:25:44.545 --> 01:25:46.579
that's what we give to charity.
The rabbi says "no, no, no"...

01:25:46.787 --> 01:25:48.497
we'll throw the money way
up in the air...

01:25:48.664 --> 01:25:50.708
and whatever God wants, He keeps.

01:25:57.631 --> 01:26:01.384
Oh! I get it. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...

01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:17.733
What's the matter?

01:26:20.235 --> 01:26:22.237
- Is he laughing?
- Yeah.

01:26:24.406 --> 01:26:26.273
And the joke wasn't
even that funny.

01:26:26.325 --> 01:26:27.992
And I figured I screwed up
the punch line.

01:26:28.368 --> 01:26:30.703
Whatever God wants
He keeps.

01:26:31.204 --> 01:26:32.830
Well, you look kinda
shook up.

01:26:32.882 --> 01:26:34.582
Yeah, it's really true.

01:26:35.833 --> 01:26:38.336
Spontaneous emotional
response.

01:26:38.378 --> 01:26:39.837
I am alive. Yes?

01:26:40.505 --> 01:26:42.507
Yeah, yeah, yes you are.
Yes! Yes!

01:26:49.179 --> 01:26:50.128
Hey!

01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.099
I hope you bought enough
for everybody.

01:26:52.724 --> 01:26:54.226
Give me one, too, Steph.

01:26:55.769 --> 01:26:57.854
Oh, right on the sensor.

01:27:03.526 --> 01:27:05.611
Danger! Nova!

01:27:10.449 --> 01:27:11.867
All right, come on,
come down.

01:27:12.868 --> 01:27:14.485
Why?
Just tell them he's alive.

01:27:14.537 --> 01:27:15.955
Well, it doesn't look like
they want to hear that.

01:27:16.007 --> 01:27:16.820
What? Wait a minute.

01:27:16.872 --> 01:27:18.958
The plan was: We convince you,
and you convince them.

01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:20.626
Damn it, Crosby,
you lied to me again.

01:27:46.859 --> 01:27:48.058
Deploy!

01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:50.362
Hit it, hit it, hit it!
Deploy!

01:27:54.617 --> 01:27:56.994
The army!
The real army!

01:27:57.161 --> 01:27:59.787
Your target is there,
gentlemen.

01:28:00.997 --> 01:28:02.530
Crosby...

01:28:02.582 --> 01:28:05.918
if I were you I would
come out of there.

01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:07.451
Stat.

01:28:07.503 --> 01:28:09.964
Jesus, these guys
are really severe!

01:28:10.715 --> 01:28:13.051
Weapons. M-16 machine guns.

01:28:13.509 --> 01:28:16.136
- 40mm grenade launchers.
- Let me handle it.

01:28:18.597 --> 01:28:20.182
Hi, Howard.

01:28:20.432 --> 01:28:22.267
Schroeder. How you doin'?

01:28:22.559 --> 01:28:24.426
Howard. Howard!

01:28:24.478 --> 01:28:27.397
We're fine. Number Five
is right here with us.

01:28:27.449 --> 01:28:30.098
I've got it completely
under my control.

01:28:30.150 --> 01:28:32.402
- Another lie.
- I'm lying to them, not to you.

01:28:32.569 --> 01:28:33.820
It's still lying.

01:28:35.029 --> 01:28:37.365
We're coming out now.

01:28:40.409 --> 01:28:42.370
They're cooking something up.
I can smell it.

01:28:42.422 --> 01:28:44.246
We gotta fire them now, Howard.

01:28:45.748 --> 01:28:48.334
Don't you dare shoot
your stupid guns.

01:28:48.376 --> 01:28:51.170
- Where's Number Five?
- He's fine. He's in the van.

01:28:51.963 --> 01:28:53.254
Okay. Okay.

01:28:53.672 --> 01:28:57.050
Why don't you and the young
lady just get away from the van...

01:28:57.217 --> 01:28:58.718
and let us handle it?

01:28:58.802 --> 01:29:01.388
Yes, Stephanie, get away.
Danger.

01:29:01.888 --> 01:29:03.390
No, listen...

01:29:03.765 --> 01:29:06.935
I was able to activate
the voice command module.

01:29:06.987 --> 01:29:07.800
God damn it!

01:29:07.852 --> 01:29:10.355
I am sick and tired of listening
to this technical bullshit.

01:29:10.396 --> 01:29:13.440
Shut up, Schroeder,
I'll handle this.

01:29:13.492 --> 01:29:15.276
He's stalling.

01:29:17.152 --> 01:29:21.949
Crosby, we're going to have to
ask you to surrender the robot.

01:29:23.575 --> 01:29:24.576
No!

01:29:25.995 --> 01:29:28.579
- Stat?
- Stat!

01:29:28.913 --> 01:29:32.083
- What does that mean anyway?
- I don't know.

01:29:32.959 --> 01:29:34.711
But that is not the point.

01:29:34.877 --> 01:29:37.380
We need that robot.

01:29:37.422 --> 01:29:39.205
Howard, listen...

01:29:39.257 --> 01:29:41.259
I know what
the malfunction is.

01:29:41.968 --> 01:29:43.084
Sorry, Crosby...

01:29:43.136 --> 01:29:45.075
we can't take any more chances.

01:29:45.127 --> 01:29:47.014
We're not losing that thing again.

01:29:47.347 --> 01:29:50.475
Howard, if you'd just come over
and inspect the unit...

01:29:52.769 --> 01:29:54.354
You're all such
a bunch of liars!

01:29:55.230 --> 01:29:57.524
As soon as they're clear,
open fire!

01:29:57.608 --> 01:29:58.431
What have you done?

01:29:58.483 --> 01:30:00.130
- Schroeder!
- I'll take care of this.

01:30:00.182 --> 01:30:01.778
No, you're not taking over.
Now listen...

01:30:04.822 --> 01:30:06.574
Banzai!

01:30:10.369 --> 01:30:12.163
<i>Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!</i>

01:30:12.371 --> 01:30:14.290
He's alive! He's alive!

01:30:17.418 --> 01:30:18.450
Call them off, Howard.

01:30:18.502 --> 01:30:20.338
You're making the biggest
mistake in history!

01:30:20.463 --> 01:30:22.131
He's alive! I can prove it.

01:30:25.383 --> 01:30:27.636
No, look, it's okay.
He's going to make it!

01:31:18.642 --> 01:31:20.102
No!

01:31:34.783 --> 01:31:36.617
Number Five!

01:32:00.807 --> 01:32:04.436
Oh, my God.
Get me out of here.

01:32:14.737 --> 01:32:16.697
Magnificent! Magnificent!

01:32:16.739 --> 01:32:19.241
Now that, my friend,
is how you kick ass!

01:32:19.366 --> 01:32:22.620
Years of research are down the tube
and you're happy as a pig in slop.

01:32:22.661 --> 01:32:24.705
Just doing my job, sir.

01:32:25.748 --> 01:32:28.751
Maybe from now on you can
do it somewhere else.

01:32:57.402 --> 01:32:59.029
Are you going to be okay?

01:33:00.364 --> 01:33:02.240
I don't think so.

01:33:02.658 --> 01:33:04.493
Not for a while.

01:33:08.037 --> 01:33:09.956
I'm sorry you lost your job.

01:33:10.665 --> 01:33:13.542
But I'm really glad you quit Nova.

01:33:15.336 --> 01:33:17.713
- What will you do now?
- I don't know yet.

01:33:18.881 --> 01:33:21.467
My dad left me a few
acres up in Montana.

01:33:22.134 --> 01:33:24.344
I hear it's beautiful there
this time of year.

01:33:24.761 --> 01:33:26.304
Great idea!

01:33:26.388 --> 01:33:29.474
I say we cruise on up there
and check it out.

01:33:32.018 --> 01:33:34.104
Hi, honey! I'm home!

01:33:34.604 --> 01:33:36.064
Number Five?

01:33:38.942 --> 01:33:41.403
Pull over, pull over,
quick, pull over!

01:33:49.827 --> 01:33:52.079
- Number Five!
- Stephanie!

01:33:52.121 --> 01:33:54.999
It's so good to see you.
I thought they blew you up.

01:33:55.124 --> 01:33:57.626
Counterfeit. facsimile.
Replica!

01:33:59.169 --> 01:34:01.963
He made a duplicate of himself
from all these spare parts.

01:34:02.015 --> 01:34:03.715
That's incredible!
This guy's a genius!

01:34:03.798 --> 01:34:05.331
Above average.

01:34:05.383 --> 01:34:06.426
Oh, Number Five, you are great!

01:34:06.467 --> 01:34:08.678
You're outstandingly great!

01:34:10.346 --> 01:34:11.598
What's our next move?

01:34:11.639 --> 01:34:13.725
Come on, let's do as he says.
We'll go to Montana.

01:34:13.777 --> 01:34:14.726
Ya!

01:34:15.226 --> 01:34:17.604
I got forty acres up there.
Great for him to hide out...

01:34:17.656 --> 01:34:19.010
Soak up input.

01:34:19.062 --> 01:34:21.398
I don't know. I have
responsibilities here.

01:34:21.450 --> 01:34:23.734
- What about my animals?
- Come on, Stephanie.

01:34:23.786 --> 01:34:26.153
Wait a minute.
Did you say forty acres?

01:34:26.653 --> 01:34:28.947
Listen, do you like animals?

01:34:29.865 --> 01:34:31.867
Yeah. How many animals
are we talking about?

01:34:31.919 --> 01:34:34.745
Great. I drive, you two
work this out.

01:34:48.215 --> 01:34:50.833
Number five stupid name.

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:55.055
- Want to be Kevin or Dave.
- Just watch the road, okay?

01:34:55.513 --> 01:34:57.682
Maybe Johnny. Yeah.

01:34:58.141 --> 01:35:00.810
Johnny Five. That's cool.

01:35:03.813 --> 01:35:05.106
Gimme five.
