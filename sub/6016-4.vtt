18:27.941 --> 18:30.359
I'm sorry. Where were we?

18:30.359 --> 18:34.906
Well, I was just telling you

18:30.359 --> 18:34.906
about this other guy.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.783
Elaine.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.783
Yeah?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.451
Do you remember your dream

18:38.451 --> 18:41.495
where you had a sexual encounter

18:38.451 --> 18:41.495
with a Chinese woman?

18:44.290 --> 18:45.833
Yeah. Ye--

18:45.833 --> 18:47.460
[COUGHS]

18:47.460 --> 18:48.502
Mm-hmm.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.088
Elaine, I'm concerned about you.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.589
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.008
Don't concern yourself with me,

18:51.589 --> 18:54.008
because I'm good.

18:54.008 --> 18:58.054
I'm very good. I mean,

18:54.008 --> 18:58.054
I'm really very, very good.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.098
Elaine...

19:00.098 --> 19:02.516
Have you been urinating

19:00.098 --> 19:02.516
a lot again?

19:08.355 --> 19:09.398
No.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.027
And how often

19:10.650 --> 19:13.027
have you been seeing, um...

19:13.027 --> 19:15.113
I'm sorry.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.113
What is his name?

19:15.113 --> 19:16.363
His name?

19:16.363 --> 19:17.490
Yes. His name.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.533
Um, well,

19:17.490 --> 19:19.533
what's the difference?

19:19.533 --> 19:21.368
Are you afraid

19:19.533 --> 19:21.368
to tell me his name?

19:21.368 --> 19:24.580
No, no, I just don't really see

19:21.368 --> 19:24.580
how that's relevant.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.291
It doesn't matter

19:24.580 --> 19:27.291
if you don't see how. I see how.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.086
Uh, his name. Um...

19:30.086 --> 19:31.921
[SCOFFS]

19:30.086 --> 19:31.921
I don't-- I don't even know.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.589
All right,

19:31.921 --> 19:33.589
you wanna know his name?

19:33.589 --> 19:35.883
I'll tell you his name.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.883
His name is...

19:35.883 --> 19:37.760
Kramer.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.221
Kramer.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.349
Is that his first name

19:41.221 --> 19:43.349
or his last name?

19:43.349 --> 19:44.725
You know,

19:44.725 --> 19:47.103
I'm really uncomfortable

19:44.725 --> 19:47.103
talking about this.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.938
Elaine, I want you

19:47.103 --> 19:48.938
to do me a favor.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.564
What?

19:50.564 --> 19:53.067
I want you to tell this

19:50.564 --> 19:53.067
young man to give me a call.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.485
It's important

19:53.067 --> 19:54.485
that I speak to him.

19:54.485 --> 19:56.362
Oh, no, no, no,

19:54.485 --> 19:56.362
I can't do that.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.156
You can do it,

19:56.362 --> 19:58.156
and you will do it.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.239
No, I can't.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.659
You can, and you will.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.829
Okay, okay,

20:04.829 --> 20:06.539
I'll have Kramer

20:04.829 --> 20:06.539
give you a call.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.835
So you didn't even let

20:08.749 --> 20:10.835

20:10.835 --> 20:13.337
I wouldn't give him

20:10.835 --> 20:13.337
the satisfaction.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.422
Why did you leave

20:13.337 --> 20:15.422
your wallet in your pants?

20:15.422 --> 20:16.841
What are you

20:15.422 --> 20:16.841
talking about?

20:16.841 --> 20:18.926
What, was I supposed to

20:16.841 --> 20:18.926
hide it somewhere?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.427
You could've

20:18.926 --> 20:20.427
taken it with you.

Oh, yeah. I'll be lying

Hello.

Hello.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.519
Hi, Uncle Leo.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.523
I just spoke

20:29.645 --> 20:32.523
to Dr. Dembrow's son.

20:32.523 --> 20:34.692
He said they almost

20:32.523 --> 20:34.692
had to call the police.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.152
What are you

20:34.692 --> 20:36.152
talking about?

20:36.152 --> 20:37.737
I'm the one who should've

20:36.152 --> 20:37.737
called the police.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.946
They stole my wallet.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.447
You know

20:38.946 --> 20:40.447
how hard it was for me

20:40.447 --> 20:41.991
to get

20:40.447 --> 20:41.991
that appointment for you?

20:41.991 --> 20:44.284
You can't just walk in

20:41.991 --> 20:44.284
on this guy.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.828
He did me

20:44.284 --> 20:45.828
a personal favor.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.121
All right, Leo.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.998
And you walked out

20:47.121 --> 20:48.998
without paying.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.918
How was I supposed to pay?

20:48.998 --> 20:51.918
I didn't have my wallet.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.545
Well, I hope

20:51.918 --> 20:54.545
you send him a check.

20:54.545 --> 20:55.880
What for?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.048
What for?

20:57.048 --> 20:59.258
This man was nice enough

20:57.048 --> 20:59.258
to see you.

He did me

20:59.258 --> 21:01.552
a personal favor.

21:01.552 --> 21:04.055
That's the second time

21:01.552 --> 21:04.055
you said personal favor.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.556
Why do you keep

21:04.055 --> 21:05.556
saying that?

21:05.556 --> 21:06.766
I said it once.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.017
Twice...

21:08.017 --> 21:09.936
and Dembrow doesn't

21:08.017 --> 21:09.936
even know you.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.979
His son happens to live

21:09.936 --> 21:11.979
on your floor.

21:14.148 --> 21:17.818
Leo, where did you

21:14.148 --> 21:17.818
get that watch?

21:17.818 --> 21:20.905
You know

21:17.818 --> 21:20.905
where I got this?

21:20.905 --> 21:24.909
<i>I found it in the garbage can.</i>

21:24.909 --> 21:26.827
<i>It kept terrible time.</i>

21:31.165 --> 21:32.959

Doesn't that look like

21:39.173 --> 21:41.341
the one we gave Jerry?

Hey, where's the waiter?

Let's live a little.

Could we continue this

21:48.432 --> 21:51.185
another time?

21:59.193 --> 22:02.655
the "to be continued" coming,

22:02.655 --> 22:04.364

Then there's

22:05.574 --> 22:07.118
five minutes left,

22:07.118 --> 22:08.368
and suddenly you realize,

you watch a TV show

is because it ends.
