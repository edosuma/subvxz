WEBVTT

00:01.004 --> 00:02.701
Alright, you know what
this is driving me crazy.

00:02.702 --> 00:05.071
Every single one of these names
is terrible.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.939
Okay. W-Why don't we just
go with a family name?

00:06.941 --> 00:08.674
I think I had an Aunt Eunice.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.009
Are you kidding me?

00:11.346 --> 00:13.811
Okay, why don't we just
name her after your mother?

00:15.049 --> 00:17.215
We probably shouldn't name
every single one of our kids

00:17.217 --> 00:19.851
after my dead relatives.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.856
This is nice.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.991
You know, it's like we've
known each other a lifetime,

00:26.993 --> 00:30.862
but we're now just getting
to know each other again.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.764
I remember when I first met you.

00:32.766 --> 00:35.800
- You were this gorgeous resident...
- Mm.

00:35.802 --> 00:38.269
Bumbling your way through
your surgical assignments.

00:38.271 --> 00:40.504
- "Bumbling"? I never bumbled.
- Oh... Oh, yeah.

00:40.506 --> 00:43.041
You once got lost and did
10 laps around my office.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.075
Mm.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.243
Charlie, that wasn't an accident.

00:46.245 --> 00:49.547
Well played, Dr. Reid.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.649
My office.

00:52.651 --> 00:56.587
You know, it's not too late
for you to un-resign.

00:56.589 --> 00:57.921
No.

00:57.923 --> 00:59.756
No, it was the right thing to do.

00:59.758 --> 01:01.358
Besides, it's gonna give me
more time to spend

01:01.360 --> 01:02.993
with you and Luke and good, old...

01:02.995 --> 01:04.427
- Our little what's-her-name?
- Yeah.

01:06.331 --> 01:08.498
So, what about you? How you feeling?

01:08.500 --> 01:11.702
You're on the verge
of making history today.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.303
I'm good...

01:13.305 --> 01:15.472
for a bumbling resident.

01:15.474 --> 01:18.609
Ah, she was up all night making that.

01:20.044 --> 01:21.711
Excuse me!

01:21.713 --> 01:25.081
- Whoa!
- All hail the new, old Chief.

01:27.319 --> 01:29.785
Thank you.

01:29.787 --> 01:32.755
Okay, when I accepted
the position, part of my mandate

01:32.757 --> 01:35.758
was to put this hospital's
surgical team back on the map.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.593
When Dr. Reid made her pitch

01:37.595 --> 01:39.495
for the treatment
of metastatic abdominal cancer,

01:39.497 --> 01:41.097
it was a bold one.

01:41.099 --> 01:42.932
But I think that we are
up for the challenge.

01:42.934 --> 01:44.767
Doctor.

01:44.769 --> 01:48.337
Thank you. As you know,
this is a trial run for us.

01:48.339 --> 01:50.906
But if we succeed, we'll be
the only hospital in the city

01:50.908 --> 01:52.807
that's authorized
to perform the procedure.

01:52.809 --> 01:55.410
Now, the doctor that we need
to impress is from NYU.

01:55.412 --> 01:57.846
She'll supervise.
Her name is Dr. Flora Johnson.

01:59.916 --> 02:02.951
Oh, sorry. She...
She's my professional hero.

02:02.953 --> 02:04.119
No offense.

02:04.121 --> 02:05.287
- None taken.
- None taken.

02:05.289 --> 02:06.721
I heard that Johnson's looking

02:06.723 --> 02:08.289
for a new resident for her new study.

02:08.292 --> 02:09.890
That explains why Cassie's kissing ass

02:09.893 --> 02:12.060
- with arts and crafts.
- As you can see,

02:12.062 --> 02:14.228
Dr. Williams has posted
the assignments here.

02:14.230 --> 02:16.765
Hold the phone! Sorry.

02:16.767 --> 02:17.899
I want in on this, too.

02:17.901 --> 02:19.100
No, Dr. Kinney.

02:19.102 --> 02:20.601
Sorry, but you're not on the schedule.

02:20.603 --> 02:23.905
If anyone gets to cure a woman
with incurable cancer, it's me.

02:27.610 --> 02:28.842
Still playing the cancer card?

02:28.844 --> 02:30.511
Yeah, I figure I've got a few left.

02:30.513 --> 02:32.046
Okay. Tell me about the patient.

02:32.048 --> 02:34.315
Her name is Santina Vanelli.

02:34.317 --> 02:36.617
She is 65 years old.

02:36.619 --> 02:39.053
Santina emigrated from Italy
40 years ago

02:39.055 --> 02:42.890
and made enough money to bring
her entire extended family over.

02:42.892 --> 02:44.624
Her daughter died five years ago,

02:44.626 --> 02:47.294
and she's been taking care
of her granddaughter ever since.

02:48.497 --> 02:50.330
Santina developed
appendiceal cancer,

02:50.332 --> 02:52.566
which has spread to her stomach lining.

02:52.568 --> 02:54.568
Now, she was told
she had two weeks to live.

02:54.570 --> 02:58.738
We're gonna give her 10 years.

02:58.740 --> 03:01.608
So, Bell, Reid, and Kinney
get to remove all the tumors,

03:01.610 --> 03:05.044
and all we get to do is fill her
belly with heated chemo drugs

03:05.046 --> 03:06.813
and stand around
until it's time to drain it?

03:06.815 --> 03:08.481
Least we get to be a part of history.

03:08.483 --> 03:09.849
Well, watching history happen

03:09.851 --> 03:11.518
is not the same thing
as being a part of it.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.420
Actually, I have another job for you.

03:13.422 --> 03:15.688
Santina has a very big,
very concerned family,

03:15.690 --> 03:18.024
and I'd like her getting updates
every hour on the hour.

03:18.026 --> 03:20.927
Yeah, so, I'm not a messenger.
I'm a surgeon.

03:20.929 --> 03:23.763
Oh, don't sell yourself short, Billy.

03:23.765 --> 03:25.798
You can do both.

03:32.106 --> 03:33.472
Mom, seriously, I'm fine.

03:33.474 --> 03:35.307
I have to do something, bachcha.

03:35.309 --> 03:37.443
She's here.

03:37.445 --> 03:38.544
Good morning.

03:38.546 --> 03:40.212
Hey! How's my baby?

03:40.214 --> 03:43.415
He's in the NICU, but from all
reports, he's recuperating well.

03:43.417 --> 03:45.551
Rest is the most important thing
for you right now, Falak.

03:45.553 --> 03:46.885
- Yeah.
- How can she rest

03:46.887 --> 03:48.686
when you've given her
such a wonderful present?

03:48.688 --> 03:51.522
Yes. Just excuse the paper quality.

03:51.524 --> 03:54.492
It's the best I could do
on short notice.

03:54.494 --> 03:56.527
So, you're still interested
in the adoption?

03:56.529 --> 03:57.562
Yes.

03:57.564 --> 03:59.430
I-I didn't show you the best part.

03:59.432 --> 04:02.167
Um, so, these are,
uh, memento pages,

04:02.169 --> 04:04.202
so as he gets older, see, you can...

04:04.204 --> 04:06.271
First tooth,

04:06.273 --> 04:08.506
first soccer goal,
first day of school...

04:08.508 --> 04:10.675
We didn't want you to miss out.

04:10.677 --> 04:12.176
It's time to rest.

04:12.178 --> 04:14.512
The adoption lawyer will be here soon.

04:14.514 --> 04:15.647
He's coming now?

04:15.649 --> 04:19.384
I figure why wait?

04:19.386 --> 04:21.819
Jackson, I don't have time
for a consult.

04:21.821 --> 04:24.288
- Dr. Johnson's gonna be here any minute.
- He asked for you,

04:24.290 --> 04:26.857
said you missed something
last time he was here.

04:26.859 --> 04:30.494
Picture him in blue spandex.

04:30.496 --> 04:32.029
Dr. Williams.

04:32.031 --> 04:33.530
It's me, Jake.

04:33.532 --> 04:35.966
The Horn of Death? Mercury poisoning.

04:35.968 --> 04:38.168
Yeah, I-I remember you, Mr. Bugle.

04:38.170 --> 04:39.603
You look very different.

04:39.605 --> 04:40.870
Clean up good, huh?

04:40.872 --> 04:42.939
Uh, said he's feeling
lightheaded, disoriented,

04:42.941 --> 04:44.374
can't eat or sleep.

04:44.376 --> 04:46.810
Give us some privacy, bro?

04:46.812 --> 04:48.044
"Bro."

04:49.348 --> 04:51.548
Jake, your symptoms should have
cleared up by now,

04:51.550 --> 04:54.184
unless you're still smashing
light bulbs on yourself?

04:54.186 --> 04:57.720
No, Ma'am. Got a real job,
selling cars...

04:57.722 --> 05:00.389
used, but, hell, so am I, right?

05:00.391 --> 05:02.258
Hence the sweet suit.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.361
Do you have a change
in exercise or diet?

05:05.363 --> 05:06.729
I'm not malnourished.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.532
- I'm in love.
- Oh!

05:09.534 --> 05:12.167
Good for you.

05:12.169 --> 05:13.268
Oh.

05:15.239 --> 05:17.906
You're the one who sent me the balloons

05:17.908 --> 05:21.644
and the chameleon...

05:21.646 --> 05:24.880
and that book in my locker.
How did you even get in there?

05:24.882 --> 05:26.982
The myth of Cassandra. Did you like it?

05:26.984 --> 05:28.116
I know it gets a little dark,

05:28.118 --> 05:30.719
but I feel like Apollo meant well.

05:33.123 --> 05:34.256
Mm.

05:34.258 --> 05:36.424
Dr. Johnson should be here by now.

05:38.795 --> 05:40.095
Alex, you know that I didn't want

05:40.097 --> 05:41.864
to get Chief like this, right?

05:41.866 --> 05:43.298
Yeah, of course.

05:43.300 --> 05:46.735
You were just looking after
Charlie and this hospital.

05:46.737 --> 05:49.738
Maybe she missed her flight.

05:52.342 --> 05:53.808
- Dr. Bishop.
- Dr. Bishop.

05:53.810 --> 05:55.377
Surprise!

05:55.379 --> 05:58.079
Right back at ya. Huh?

05:58.081 --> 05:59.414
I heard you two were back.

05:59.416 --> 06:01.048
- Alex, congratulations.
- Yeah, well...

06:01.050 --> 06:03.417
Dr. Bell, always a pleasure.

06:03.419 --> 06:06.254
Nice to see you. And why are
we seeing you, exactly?

06:06.256 --> 06:08.689
Well, Dr. Johnson got held up
at her conference in Dubai,

06:08.691 --> 06:11.125
and I'm her second-in-command,
so she sent me instead.

06:11.127 --> 06:12.159
Nice.

06:12.161 --> 06:13.660
I didn't know
you were living in New York.

06:13.662 --> 06:15.029
I thought you went back to California.

06:15.031 --> 06:16.530
- To work on my marriage?
- Yeah.

06:16.532 --> 06:19.032
Yeah. Guess how that worked out.

06:19.034 --> 06:20.467
Sorry.

06:20.469 --> 06:23.737
Geez, when did things become
so serious around here?

06:23.739 --> 06:25.439
Guess that's why
fate brought me back...

06:25.441 --> 06:26.874
put a little fun in the fold.

06:26.876 --> 06:30.411
That, and hand over the reins
on the most amazing surgery.

06:30.413 --> 06:32.045
- Giddyup.
- That's my line.

06:37.052 --> 06:38.318
Dev, what's going on?

06:38.320 --> 06:41.754
Chest pains, elevated B.P.

06:41.756 --> 06:43.623
- What are you doing here?
- Doogie.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.926
Everything was fine until he came.

06:45.928 --> 06:47.760
- W-Who are you?
- I'm the son-in-law.

06:47.762 --> 06:49.595
Okay, heart is good, lungs are clear.

06:49.597 --> 06:51.030
Maybe it was a panic attack.

06:51.032 --> 06:53.833
Can you get me 5 milligrams I.V.
Diazepam?

06:53.835 --> 06:56.068
You should have never come back.

06:56.070 --> 06:57.369
This is all your fault.

06:57.371 --> 06:59.204
If I had a nickel for every time
something was my fault...

06:59.206 --> 07:01.674
Then maybe you could afford to
take care of your own daughter.

07:01.676 --> 07:03.843
Smettila!

07:03.845 --> 07:05.611
Your mother-in-law will be just fine.

07:05.613 --> 07:07.980
I don't want her to be fine.
I want her to suffer,

07:07.982 --> 07:09.514
like she made me suffer.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:20.885 --> 07:22.586
All good.

07:24.023 --> 07:25.822
- Morning.
- Morning.

07:25.824 --> 07:28.091
Thought the team
could use some refueling.

07:28.093 --> 07:29.726
Or you're hoping to poach a consult

07:29.728 --> 07:31.461
you're not authorized to take.

07:31.463 --> 07:33.096
- Let's see how radiology's doing.
- Oh, didn't say

07:33.098 --> 07:34.297
I didn't want that coffee there.

07:34.299 --> 07:36.232
Mm-hmm.

07:36.234 --> 07:38.969
Listen, you and Alex should
come by for barbecue Sunday.

07:38.971 --> 07:40.870
We put in a hot tub.

07:40.872 --> 07:42.705
You want me to get
into a bubbling Petri dish

07:42.707 --> 07:45.508
with you, my pregnant
girlfriend, and my ex-wife?

07:45.510 --> 07:46.842
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

07:46.844 --> 07:49.379
- Mm!
- Or... go fishin'.

07:49.381 --> 07:50.846
I don't need a hobby, Zach.

07:50.848 --> 07:53.216
I'm sure other hospitals are
already banging down your door.

07:53.218 --> 07:54.984
I think you should just retire,
buy a motor home,

07:54.986 --> 07:57.687
and see America one Walmart
parking lot at a time.

07:57.689 --> 07:59.421
I need your help with a patient,
my patient,

07:59.423 --> 08:00.350
the one that's the wrestler

08:00.351 --> 08:01.723
- that was from last...
- Slow down, Cassie.

08:01.726 --> 08:05.527
He said he's in love with me.

08:05.529 --> 08:08.230
I mean, he's probably harmless, right?

08:08.232 --> 08:11.433
Oh, yeah, yep. 260 pounds of harmless.

08:11.435 --> 08:14.303
Today is the most important
surgery of my entire career,

08:14.305 --> 08:16.971
and he's not even sick.
He's just a creep.

08:16.973 --> 08:19.040
- Yep, and I'm calling security.
- I'll deal with it, Jackson.

08:19.042 --> 08:20.842
They're still touchy
about the whole Taser incident.

08:20.844 --> 08:22.177
Thank you. Thank you.

08:22.179 --> 08:23.579
You bet.

08:30.420 --> 08:31.986
Hi, there.

08:31.988 --> 08:34.022
Where's Dr. Williams?

08:34.024 --> 08:35.890
Forget Dr. Williams.
She's on another case,

08:35.892 --> 08:40.461
and, uh, she's not interested...

08:40.462 --> 08:43.397
in you.

08:43.399 --> 08:45.333
Oh.

08:45.335 --> 08:47.134
Like to lift weights?

08:47.136 --> 08:50.238
What are you,
her boyfriend or something?

08:50.240 --> 08:53.341
Listen, man, whatever connection
you think you felt,

08:53.343 --> 08:54.508
whatever happened between you two,

08:54.510 --> 08:57.945
it was just Dr. Williams
being a good doctor.

08:57.947 --> 09:00.648
I don't want any trouble.

09:00.650 --> 09:02.649
I'll just wait here
till she's done her shift.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.788
Actually, there's nothing
medically wrong with you,

09:07.790 --> 09:12.059
so I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

09:13.495 --> 09:15.095
Okay.

09:15.097 --> 09:16.563
Fine.

09:19.134 --> 09:21.968
Male, 20s, pedestrian versus car.

09:21.970 --> 09:24.271
Okay, got open tib-fib fractures here.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.606
Charlie, you can't.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.475
Page Dr. Kane.

09:28.477 --> 09:29.743
Page Turser. She's better.

09:29.745 --> 09:33.045
On three! One, two, three!

09:33.047 --> 09:34.481
Okay, first thing's first.

09:34.483 --> 09:35.915
We need to stabilize these fractures

09:35.917 --> 09:37.683
and control the bleeding.

09:37.685 --> 09:39.285
Bishop, it was just a panic attack.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.187
Look, her heart is 65 years old.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.890
Already, that's not ideal
for a 14-hour surgery.

09:43.892 --> 09:46.259
We'll do another ECG. We can do
a full work-up, if you'd like.

09:46.261 --> 09:48.494
Every hospital wants to be
the first to do this surgery...

09:48.496 --> 09:50.797
Mississauga Memorial,
Oshawa, North York.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.131
They're all knocking
on Dr. Johnson's door.

09:53.133 --> 09:56.302
If Santina dies on the table,
that's it for your new mandate.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.136
And that's it for you being
the Sugarbaker specialist

09:58.138 --> 09:59.438
- in this town.
- You know what?

09:59.440 --> 10:02.040
We would never jeopardize
a patient's life for my ego.

10:02.042 --> 10:04.109
I want you two to have this procedure,

10:04.111 --> 10:07.413
just not with this patient.

10:07.415 --> 10:09.147
Hey, sorry I'm late, I...

10:11.651 --> 10:14.119
No. Um, you have to leave

10:14.121 --> 10:16.387
before Dr. Johnson gets here.

10:16.389 --> 10:18.523
Hey, Cassie.

10:18.525 --> 10:21.259
Dr. Johnson got held up.

10:21.261 --> 10:23.061
She sent me in her place.

10:23.063 --> 10:24.595
You?

10:24.597 --> 10:27.765
I'm her surgical fellow.

10:27.767 --> 10:30.635
Oh.

10:30.637 --> 10:32.370
You... broke my heart,

10:32.372 --> 10:36.341
and then you moved to New York
to work under my surgical hero?

10:36.343 --> 10:38.843
Well, you always spoke
so highly of her.

10:38.845 --> 10:41.178
What about your wife?

10:41.180 --> 10:43.613
What about moving to L.A.
to make it work?

10:43.615 --> 10:46.884
Ohh. I'm sorry. I...

10:46.886 --> 10:48.719
I don't... I don't need an explanation.

10:48.721 --> 10:50.387
I need you to get Dr. Johnson here

10:50.389 --> 10:51.822
so she can see how talented I am

10:51.824 --> 10:54.658
and pick me to be her new resident.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.160
You're shopping around for a new job?

10:56.162 --> 10:57.828
Okay, you know what?
We're getting off-track here.

10:57.830 --> 10:59.629
The most important thing
is that we convince you

10:59.631 --> 11:01.197
to do the surgery.

11:01.199 --> 11:02.198
We have to convince you?

11:02.200 --> 11:03.433
Yes, Dr. Bishop doesn't think

11:03.435 --> 11:06.503
Mrs. Vanelli will survive the surgery.

11:06.505 --> 11:08.739
Santina's survived a polio outbreak,

11:08.741 --> 11:11.575
scarlet fever, and a Fascist invasion.

11:11.577 --> 11:14.543
She will be fine today.

11:14.545 --> 11:15.879
I made manicotti.

11:15.881 --> 11:19.182
It's a long surgery,
and you'll need your strength.

11:19.184 --> 11:21.450
This is Bianca, my niece.

11:21.452 --> 11:23.386
Santina takes care of her

11:23.388 --> 11:26.689
ever since her mother passed away.

11:26.691 --> 11:28.858
Thank you for fixing my Nonna.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.326
Thank you, Bianca.

11:30.328 --> 11:33.496
It looks delicious.

11:33.498 --> 11:35.130
Thank you.

11:42.473 --> 11:45.641
I can't approve the surgery
'cause they made pasta.

11:47.811 --> 11:50.245
When you left, I was humiliated.

11:50.247 --> 11:52.414
And it took me a very long time
to get back on track.

11:52.416 --> 11:55.784
And now I am Chief Resident.

11:55.786 --> 11:57.986
If these two surgeons
say that the patient is okay,

11:57.988 --> 12:00.956
she is okay.

12:00.958 --> 12:02.557
Approve the surgery.

12:06.830 --> 12:08.229
Prep the O.R.

12:08.231 --> 12:10.097
Great!

12:10.099 --> 12:12.333
Aha. Nice.

12:12.335 --> 12:14.135
Let's do this.

12:14.137 --> 12:15.403
Okay. And finally,

12:15.405 --> 12:17.839
I'll need an update
from the child's physician.

12:17.841 --> 12:19.941
Yes. Neonatology gave a full report.

12:19.943 --> 12:21.342
The baby's status has been upgraded.

12:21.344 --> 12:23.610
He only needs incubation
every four hours now.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.913
Which means
we can finally hold him.

12:25.915 --> 12:28.515
That's excellent. You should
hold him, bond with him.

12:28.517 --> 12:31.052
Skin-to-skin contact
from the mother is vital.

12:31.054 --> 12:33.120
Falak, you should hold him.

12:35.558 --> 12:38.291
All right, very good. If I can
get your signature, Falak,

12:38.293 --> 12:40.093
we'll be done here.

12:45.468 --> 12:47.434
Bachcha.

12:53.775 --> 12:55.641
Can I hold him now?

12:58.447 --> 12:59.612
We'll be fine.

13:07.255 --> 13:08.754
Should I ask him to leave?

13:08.756 --> 13:11.824
No. Bianca will want to see him.

13:11.826 --> 13:14.460
She needs her father.

13:14.462 --> 13:16.295
You know, people get emotional
and irrational

13:16.297 --> 13:17.597
when their loved ones are sick.

13:17.599 --> 13:18.998
I'm sure he didn't mean what he said.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.367
No, he did.

13:21.369 --> 13:23.435
And maybe I deserve it.

13:23.437 --> 13:25.437
Santina, you're gonna
have to take your necklace off.

13:25.439 --> 13:28.440
I can... I can give it to your sister.

13:28.442 --> 13:29.641
- Great.
- There we go.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.343
You keep. For the baby.

13:31.345 --> 13:33.278
No. Thank you.
I couldn't... I possibly...

13:33.280 --> 13:35.914
No speak English.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.949
Can't argue with that.

13:47.694 --> 13:51.195
Hi.

13:51.197 --> 13:52.931
This is for a child...

13:52.933 --> 13:55.000
m-my child.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.635
I'm... I'm finally getting a baby.

13:56.637 --> 13:59.637
That is wonderful, Shahir.
Why the, uh...?

13:59.639 --> 14:01.572
This... This is
for skin-to-skin contact,

14:01.574 --> 14:03.074
and Jonathan thinks I'm too hairy,

14:03.076 --> 14:05.309
although there are studies out
of Johns Hopkins Neonatal Unit

14:05.311 --> 14:08.179
that don't support...

14:08.181 --> 14:09.313
I'm sorry.

14:09.315 --> 14:10.748
You know, I never congratulated you

14:10.750 --> 14:12.816
on being appointed Chief of Surgery.

14:12.818 --> 14:14.085
Congratulations, Dawn.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.353
Thank you, Shahir.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.721
We really did end up with
the best surgeon for the job.

14:17.723 --> 14:19.723
You know, I never would have
brought such a perilous surgery

14:19.725 --> 14:23.427
like the Sugarbaker to this
hospital if I'd accepted.

14:23.429 --> 14:24.828
What do you mean, "if you accepted"?

14:24.830 --> 14:26.296
Yeah, the Board offered the job to me,

14:26.298 --> 14:29.900
but I turned it down
because of the adoption process.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.101
They offered it to you first?

14:31.103 --> 14:33.370
And then Dr. Storms,
but he turned down their offer.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.871
- Storms?
- Yeah, because he has

14:34.873 --> 14:37.006
his fatherly duties, thank goodness.

14:37.008 --> 14:38.675
We ended up with you.

14:38.677 --> 14:41.244
Isn't it amazing how things work out?

14:41.246 --> 14:45.648
They work out for the best.
They do, I believe.

14:45.650 --> 14:48.518
Good luck
with the Sugarbaker, Chief.

14:51.623 --> 14:54.891
So, how's Charlie dealing with
his way-too-early retirement?

14:54.893 --> 14:58.728
I honestly don't know.
This job is built into his DNA.

14:58.730 --> 15:00.096
Here am I, about to do something

15:00.098 --> 15:02.732
that's gonna open up a world
of possibilities for me, so...

15:02.734 --> 15:03.800
And you're feeling guilty?

15:03.802 --> 15:05.034
- Little bit.
- No, no.

15:05.036 --> 15:07.470
If I know Charlie, sweetie,
Nothing can keep him down.

15:07.472 --> 15:08.904
He'll get his groove back.

15:08.906 --> 15:10.706
You're right. You're right.

15:12.910 --> 15:14.276
Something wrong?

15:14.278 --> 15:16.312
Oh, no. We're good. Good to go.

15:16.314 --> 15:18.147
Your hand is shaking.

15:19.550 --> 15:21.584
Mrs. Vanelli's abdominal CT came back.

15:21.586 --> 15:24.119
Okay.

15:24.121 --> 15:26.722
Her periaortic lymph nodes
are enlarged.

15:26.724 --> 15:28.556
They are twice as big
as they were last week.

15:28.558 --> 15:30.959
So, if the cancer's already
spread, we turf the surgery?

15:30.961 --> 15:32.160
No, not necessarily.

15:32.162 --> 15:33.729
She could just be
fighting an infection.

15:33.731 --> 15:35.296
- But if Dr. Bishop sees this...
- Damn it.

15:35.298 --> 15:36.865
Does anything
work right around here?

15:36.867 --> 15:40.368
Dawn, we need to discuss this
before we scrub...

15:48.284 --> 15:49.817
I sacrificed my marriage.

15:49.819 --> 15:52.619
I sacrificed
becoming a mother, adopting.

15:52.621 --> 15:55.556
I don't even have time
to bond with Zach's kids,

15:55.558 --> 15:56.724
who hate me, by the way.

15:56.726 --> 15:58.759
- And I just, I...
- Dawn, I don't want to slap you,

15:58.761 --> 16:01.762
but I will. Take a breath.

16:01.764 --> 16:06.266
Shahir told me that he was the
Board's first choice for Chief.

16:06.268 --> 16:09.002
All of this because your ego's
a little bruised.

16:09.004 --> 16:10.371
- Don't...
- And then when he turned it down,

16:10.373 --> 16:12.005
they offered it to Storms.

16:12.007 --> 16:15.041
Those chauvinistic
slack-jawed

16:15.043 --> 16:18.711
Choosing that hack over you?
Okay, that is criminal.

16:18.713 --> 16:20.847
- Thank you! - I... This is always how it's...
- Ladies, ladies, ladies,

16:20.849 --> 16:23.549
ladies, stop it! We've got
a patient who needs us,

16:23.551 --> 16:24.985
and we have imaging that may prove

16:24.987 --> 16:26.619
the marathon surgery we are about to do

16:26.621 --> 16:28.521
is completely useless.

16:28.523 --> 16:30.623
We need a plan,

16:30.625 --> 16:32.658
okay?

16:32.660 --> 16:35.862
Do we tell Dr. Bishop
about the new scan or not?

16:35.864 --> 16:38.364
CT scans aren't good at
predicting lymph node spread.

16:38.366 --> 16:39.599
Believe me, I know.

16:39.601 --> 16:42.502
Right, but if treating her
isn't gonna do any good,

16:42.504 --> 16:45.405
then the only ethical thing
is to do nothing.

16:45.407 --> 16:47.406
What do we do?

16:47.408 --> 16:49.174
What are you guys looking at?

16:49.176 --> 16:53.345
Read it and weep, Cassie.
No Sugarbaker for you.

16:53.347 --> 16:55.347
- Has Dr. Bishop seen this?
- No, not yet.

16:55.349 --> 16:56.949
Wait, Dr. Bishop?

16:56.951 --> 17:00.119
- The Dr. Bishop?
- He came in Dr. Johnson's place.

17:00.121 --> 17:02.987
Oh. Well, this must be
really awkward for you.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.923
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

17:04.925 --> 17:06.925
Ignore the imaging.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.660
We are going to proceed as planned.

17:08.662 --> 17:10.361
If anybody has an issue with that,

17:10.363 --> 17:12.864
you can be excused. No hard feelings.

17:14.902 --> 17:16.667
Great. Let's get it done.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.105
Ugh!

17:21.107 --> 17:22.906
They don't call it "jelly belly"
for no reason.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.544
There's got to be at
least 5 pounds of mucus in here.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.646
These kinds of tumors
are actually good news,

17:28.648 --> 17:31.282
because they're easier to remove.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.851
Okay. All clear.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.719
- Reid?
- Now, take your time.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.721
Make sure
your count is accurate.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.790
If there are too many tumors
and we proceed, we're putting

17:39.792 --> 17:41.625
this nice grandmother
through hell for nothing.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.495
Or we close her up and walk
away, and she dies in two weeks.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.029
- How is that better?
- It means she gets to spend

17:46.031 --> 17:48.031
her final days at home with her family,

17:48.033 --> 17:51.201
not intubated and unconscious in
the ICU because of a procedure

17:51.203 --> 17:54.271
that wouldn't have helped her
in the first place.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.606
She's got a tumor score of 23.

17:56.608 --> 17:57.941
That's manageable.

17:57.943 --> 18:00.310
Grab your scalpels. Good to go.

18:12.323 --> 18:13.923
Mm.

18:13.925 --> 18:16.759
Notes of peat moss, honeysuckle, and...

18:18.162 --> 18:21.263
unemployment.

18:21.265 --> 18:22.866
Thank you, Zach.

18:25.136 --> 18:26.502
Aah!

18:26.504 --> 18:28.637
Aiutami, signore!

18:28.639 --> 18:31.573
You help me? We find Paolo?

18:31.575 --> 18:32.908
Oh!

18:32.910 --> 18:34.910
No, no.

18:34.912 --> 18:36.612
No, I'm... I'm out of the business.

18:36.614 --> 18:39.948
Um, you're gonna have
to find him yourself.

18:39.950 --> 18:42.050
No. If you no help,

18:42.052 --> 18:45.120
I die with a black stain on my heart.

18:45.122 --> 18:46.254
Mm, no.

18:46.256 --> 18:48.023
I-I gave up my credentials.

18:48.025 --> 18:49.357
I'm not a doctor anymore,

18:49.359 --> 18:53.996
which means no ghost "nothing."

18:53.998 --> 18:56.031
Dottoressa Reid.

18:56.033 --> 18:57.966
My doctor.

18:57.968 --> 19:01.503
You're Alex's Sugarbaker patient?

19:01.505 --> 19:03.438
Of course you are.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.639
You love her?

19:04.641 --> 19:06.841
Yes...

19:06.843 --> 19:11.312
And you always want to help her?

19:11.314 --> 19:12.747
Yes...

19:12.749 --> 19:15.115
Good! She help my cancer,

19:15.117 --> 19:18.753
you help my heart.

19:20.924 --> 19:22.890
Okay, removing
the last of the lesions

19:22.892 --> 19:24.224
from the posterior space.

19:24.226 --> 19:25.459
Hey, while you're back there,

19:25.461 --> 19:29.163
how do those periaortic
lymph nodes look?

19:29.165 --> 19:31.165
Fine. They look fine.

19:31.167 --> 19:32.999
Wait, how do you know?

19:33.001 --> 19:35.869
You can't see from there.

19:35.871 --> 19:37.137
Step aside, Dr. Reid.

19:37.139 --> 19:38.439
Of course.

19:43.245 --> 19:46.346
These lymph nodes are enlarged.
Scissors.

19:46.348 --> 19:47.714
Was this on the imaging?

19:47.716 --> 19:50.316
It showed up on the pre-op
CT scan, but as you know...

19:50.318 --> 19:52.619
Oh! You guys are killing me.

19:52.621 --> 19:54.187
Do you have any idea

19:54.189 --> 19:55.922
how unethical it is
to do this procedure

19:55.924 --> 19:57.757
if the cancer's already spread
outside the abdomen?

19:57.759 --> 19:59.392
Last November,
Dr. Johnson had a patient

19:59.394 --> 20:01.294
whose imaging showed lymph spread,

20:01.296 --> 20:04.230
and she was unconvinced, and she
continued with the Sugarbaker,

20:04.232 --> 20:06.265
- and that patient turned out just...
- She was arrogant

20:06.267 --> 20:07.800
and got lucky.

20:07.802 --> 20:09.202
She would tell you that herself.

20:09.204 --> 20:11.304
And so in the meantime, we will
send the nodes to pathology.

20:11.306 --> 20:12.838
We don't know
that the disease has spread.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.440
And you better hope
they come back negative,

20:14.442 --> 20:15.475
because if they don't...

20:15.477 --> 20:17.143
She'll be grateful that we tried.

20:17.145 --> 20:21.614
A long shot isn't the same thing
as a dead woman, Dr. Bishop.

20:21.616 --> 20:25.918
I'm gonna call Dr. Johnson,
keep her up to speed.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.886
We'll continue the resection and wait.

20:27.888 --> 20:29.788
10 blade.

20:29.790 --> 20:30.990
It's fine.

20:34.795 --> 20:35.861
Shahir.

20:35.863 --> 20:37.429
You shouldn't be here, Jonathan.

20:37.431 --> 20:39.197
Falak is gone.

20:39.199 --> 20:40.898
I went to check on her.
Her room's empty.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.867
Code Pink, sixth floor.

20:42.869 --> 20:44.936
- Code Pink, sixth floor.
- Shahir,

20:44.938 --> 20:46.904
she took the baby.

20:54.238 --> 20:57.339
Yeah, so, she's doing great.

20:57.341 --> 20:59.441
Uh, she's hanging in there, and...

20:59.443 --> 21:00.775
- Hey!
- Ah!

21:00.777 --> 21:02.777
Yeah. I'll be back in an hour.

21:02.779 --> 21:06.414
'Cause that's all I'm good for.

21:06.416 --> 21:10.285
Jake Bugle, the Horn of Death.

21:10.287 --> 21:12.054
What are you doing back here?

21:12.056 --> 21:14.055
Hi.

21:14.057 --> 21:17.191
Code Pink, Code Pink.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.526
We only have a short amount of time

21:18.528 --> 21:20.261
before Falak does any harm to her baby.

21:20.263 --> 21:22.029
Okay, well, I'll keep an eye
on floors 1 and 2.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.565
I got the Nurses' stations.

21:23.567 --> 21:25.767
Okay.

21:25.769 --> 21:27.635
And you stay here
in case she comes back.

21:27.637 --> 21:30.471
- Find them, please.
- Yes.

21:30.473 --> 21:31.873
- Nonsense in her head.
- Me?

21:31.875 --> 21:34.041
You know what?
I want my daughter back, okay?

21:34.043 --> 21:36.043
- And not just on her birthday and Christmas.
- You have no say,

21:36.045 --> 21:38.145
- not after you abandoned her like you did.
- I didn't abandon her.

21:38.147 --> 21:39.480
I was just in mourning
after Angie died.

21:39.482 --> 21:41.115
- We were all in mourning!
- I just... I just needed

21:41.117 --> 21:43.918
- some time to clear my head!
- And Bianca needed a father.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.354
Instead, she cried herself
to sleep in Santina's arms.

21:46.356 --> 21:47.588
No mama, no papa.

21:47.590 --> 21:50.056
Your sister stole her from me
and made me sound unfit.

21:50.058 --> 21:52.426
Because you are unfit! Look at you.

21:52.428 --> 21:54.294
I'm getting my daughter back,
Lucia, all right?

21:54.296 --> 21:56.162
The second your sister dies.

21:56.164 --> 21:58.298
Disgraziato!

22:00.469 --> 22:03.469
You see what a mess I make?

22:13.548 --> 22:16.182
Somebody call Dr. Williams,
see about the results.

22:18.453 --> 22:20.319
The nodes are negative.

22:20.321 --> 22:22.922
I'm gonna rescrub.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.156
Yes.

22:25.393 --> 22:27.293
Dr. Sekara, prep the chemo bath.

22:27.295 --> 22:28.594
Yep. On it.

22:28.596 --> 22:30.830
- Where is Dr. Scott?
- He went to inform the family,

22:30.832 --> 22:32.632
but that was, mm, 20 minutes ago?

22:32.634 --> 22:35.134
We finally get to his part,
and he's missing in action.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.336
- Millennials.
- While we have a moment,

22:37.338 --> 22:39.204
Dr. Bell, I'd like a word.

22:43.945 --> 22:46.045
He's been out of the incubator
for over an hour now.

22:46.047 --> 22:48.113
He could go into respiratory
failure at any time.

22:48.115 --> 22:50.549
Ah, this was my fault.

22:50.551 --> 22:54.252
I tried to stop Falak from holding him.

22:54.254 --> 22:55.587
Why would you do that?

22:55.589 --> 22:59.424
I knew once she did,
she wouldn't give him up.

22:59.426 --> 23:01.660
She doesn't understand
the stigma that follows you

23:01.662 --> 23:03.562
when you...
when you have to leave school

23:03.564 --> 23:05.897
and beg for social assistance.

23:05.899 --> 23:08.934
I had to make her understand, so I...

23:08.936 --> 23:11.069
I...

23:13.306 --> 23:15.039
You what?

23:17.310 --> 23:19.477
What did you do?

23:19.479 --> 23:21.179
- What did you do?!
- I told Falak

23:21.181 --> 23:23.881
my decision to keep her was a mistake.

23:23.883 --> 23:26.183
I...

23:26.185 --> 23:27.384
I had to be cruel.

23:27.386 --> 23:29.987
It was the only way to get her to see.

23:29.989 --> 23:32.656
Your missing mom, she's been spotted.

23:42.501 --> 23:46.370
Falak, where's the baby?

23:46.372 --> 23:47.904
Look, when he was sick,

23:47.906 --> 23:49.939
I thought a doctor would be able
to take care of him

23:49.941 --> 23:51.741
better than I could.

23:51.743 --> 23:54.144
But he's healthy now.

23:54.146 --> 23:56.913
And... he smiled at me.

23:56.915 --> 23:59.448
That wasn't a smile, that was gas.

23:59.450 --> 24:01.818
You are being incredibly selfish.

24:01.820 --> 24:03.185
Do you know how dangerous it is

24:03.187 --> 24:05.187
to move a premature baby
out of incubation?

24:05.189 --> 24:07.123
A sensible parent would know that!

24:17.001 --> 24:19.701
Look, I just want a chance
to be his mother.

24:22.606 --> 24:25.207
You are his mother, Falak.

24:37.320 --> 24:40.522
Jonathan and I can...

24:40.524 --> 24:43.992
drop the adoption...

24:43.994 --> 24:45.961
if that's what you want.

24:56.506 --> 24:58.873
Okay. Let me take him upstairs,

24:58.875 --> 25:00.675
hmm?

25:00.677 --> 25:01.876
Okay.

25:06.348 --> 25:08.449
She's a religious woman.

25:08.451 --> 25:13.187
Tell her God spoke to you and
told you she has to make amends.

25:13.189 --> 25:17.324
Um... I'm really not comfortable
pretending to be a prophet.

25:17.326 --> 25:19.159
You talk to ghosts.

25:19.161 --> 25:20.595
I'm not comfortable with that, either.

25:20.597 --> 25:22.662
Bianca?

25:22.664 --> 25:25.199
Daddy!

25:25.201 --> 25:28.168
Look at you. Oh, I missed you so much!

25:28.170 --> 25:30.104
- How are you?
- I'm good.

25:30.106 --> 25:32.005
Oh, look at you.
You went to play soccer tonight?

25:32.007 --> 25:33.073
Oh, yes, and I won.

25:33.075 --> 25:34.841
- You won? Did you score?
- Yes, I...

25:34.843 --> 25:39.045
I never thought that Paolo
was good enough for my Angie.

25:39.047 --> 25:41.047
Then she died,

25:41.049 --> 25:42.582
and he disappeared for weeks.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.518
Must have been hard on Bianca,
and all of you.

25:45.520 --> 25:49.789
But when he came back,
I-I should have embraced him.

25:49.791 --> 25:52.092
Instead, I was so angry,

25:52.094 --> 25:54.827
I took him to court.

25:54.829 --> 25:58.697
The only thing that matters
is la famiglia,

25:58.699 --> 26:03.136
and I drove a spike through mine.

26:03.138 --> 26:04.470
My...

26:06.241 --> 26:07.740
- Aah!
- Santina?

26:07.742 --> 26:09.308
Ohh! Aah!

26:09.310 --> 26:11.710
- Even if the imaging had come...
- You're basically talking about

26:11.712 --> 26:14.113
only choosing
the healthiest dying person.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.748
If you can't see the irony in that...

26:15.750 --> 26:18.416
Look, every time we do this
surgery and it doesn't work,

26:18.418 --> 26:20.686
we get flooded with calls
from reputable surgeons

26:20.688 --> 26:23.088
questioning our motives.

26:23.090 --> 26:25.858
Have you thought
about your motives, Dawn?

26:25.860 --> 26:27.859
What exactly is it
you're trying to prove?

26:27.861 --> 26:29.727
I'm not trying to prove anything.

26:29.729 --> 26:31.929
Dawn, just came to see
how your patient's doing.

26:31.931 --> 26:34.032
- Bishop?!
- Hey. It's a long story.

26:34.034 --> 26:34.999
I'm sure.

26:35.001 --> 26:36.834
- Good to see you.
- You, too, pal.

26:36.836 --> 26:38.970
The patient is fine, Charlie.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.005
Dawn, it's her heart.
Her pressure's dropping.

26:41.007 --> 26:44.742
If we don't do something fast,
we're gonna lose her.

26:44.744 --> 26:46.811
Come too far for that.

26:53.687 --> 26:55.119
Is she here?

26:55.121 --> 26:56.721
And do you think
you should be doing this?

26:56.723 --> 26:58.656
She is here, and I don't know
if I should be doing this,

26:58.658 --> 27:01.492
but it's your patient, so I'm doing it.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.627
Okay. Got to go.

27:08.768 --> 27:10.602
B.P. 50 over 30.

27:10.604 --> 27:12.103
She's got no air entry
on the left side.

27:12.105 --> 27:13.371
It could be a buildup of fluid.

27:13.373 --> 27:16.840
Yeah, but where's it coming from?

27:16.842 --> 27:19.143
Dr. Bell, you had
to peel the peritoneum

27:19.145 --> 27:21.078
off the undersurface of the diaphragm,

27:21.080 --> 27:24.148
so if there was a hole,
even a small one...

27:24.150 --> 27:27.084
The chemo solution could have
leaked into the pleural cavity.

27:27.086 --> 27:28.619
What's the temp of that chemo?

27:28.621 --> 27:30.020
Uh, 43 degrees.

27:30.022 --> 27:31.455
Okay, that kind of heat alone

27:31.457 --> 27:33.156
next to the heart
can cause an arrhythmia.

27:33.158 --> 27:35.392
Let's get the chemo out of the
abdomen, and I'll fix the hole.

27:35.394 --> 27:37.294
Okay, first thing's first.
Let me put a chest tube in

27:37.296 --> 27:38.629
to get the chemo away from the heart.

27:38.631 --> 27:40.263
That should buy us some time.

27:40.265 --> 27:41.998
Get me a chest tube, please.

27:46.905 --> 27:50.006
Dr. Fitzgerald,
please call extension 2-1-9.

27:50.008 --> 27:51.808
Dr. Fitzgerald,
call extension 2-1-9.

27:58.183 --> 27:59.950
Waiting's the worst.

27:59.952 --> 28:01.784
Yeah.

28:03.087 --> 28:04.654
I'm Charlie, by the way.

28:04.656 --> 28:06.188
Paolo.

28:09.060 --> 28:11.160
Who you waiting on?

28:11.162 --> 28:12.194
My mother-in-law.

28:12.196 --> 28:13.963
Ai, that's rough.

28:13.965 --> 28:15.531
How's your wife handling that?

28:15.533 --> 28:17.700
She passed. It's, uh, five years now.

28:17.702 --> 28:19.401
I'm sorry.

28:19.403 --> 28:20.635
That's, uh...

28:20.637 --> 28:23.638
That's my little girl
over there, Bianca.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.140
She's beautiful.

28:25.142 --> 28:27.843
Yeah. She's got her mother's looks.

28:27.845 --> 28:29.044
Thank God.

28:33.817 --> 28:34.916
Hey, if you don't mind my asking,

28:34.918 --> 28:36.284
I mean, if that's
your family over there,

28:36.286 --> 28:39.921
what are you doing
sitting here by yourself?

28:39.923 --> 28:41.656
The only way they would
break bread with me

28:41.658 --> 28:43.859
is if the food was poisoned.

28:43.861 --> 28:46.194
And the feeling is mutual.

28:46.196 --> 28:48.296
Daddy, I'm sad about Nonna.

28:48.298 --> 28:51.466
Oh. I'm sorry, baby.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.901
Bianca, come on.
You need to eat something.

28:53.903 --> 28:55.636
She's fine with me. Back off.

28:55.638 --> 28:58.473
Tu non sei un grande uomo.
Sei un asino.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.641
Zia, sit.

29:05.048 --> 29:07.148
There is an Italian saying...

29:07.150 --> 29:11.952
Avere Una famiglia significa
avere qualcuno da Amare.

29:11.954 --> 29:16.590
Avere Una casa significa
avere un posto dove andare,

29:16.592 --> 29:20.494
averle entrambe
è Una benediZione.

29:24.634 --> 29:26.699
Hey, you... you speak Italian, right?

29:26.701 --> 29:28.635
Yeah. I-I'm the black sheep,
not an idiot.

29:29.771 --> 29:31.538
I-I heard this, uh, quote once.

29:31.540 --> 29:34.541
Wonder if you can tell me
what it means. Um...

29:34.543 --> 29:37.244
Avere Una famiglia

29:37.246 --> 29:40.914
significa, uh, qualcuno...

29:40.916 --> 29:42.148
- Da Amare.
- Yeah.

29:42.150 --> 29:43.449
Yeah, yeah. I know it.

29:43.451 --> 29:46.052
It means, uh, "To have
somebody to love is family.

29:46.054 --> 29:49.989
To have somewhere to go is home.

29:49.991 --> 29:52.358
To have both is a blessing."

29:58.666 --> 30:01.534
That was Angie's favorite saying.

30:01.536 --> 30:05.271
Yeah. Those, uh... Those words
were very important to Mama.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.943
Are you hungry?

30:10.945 --> 30:14.680
We have lots of food.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.514
Yeah, I could eat.

30:16.516 --> 30:17.983
Ah.

30:22.355 --> 30:25.657
There's a long road ahead, but...

30:25.659 --> 30:28.460
It's a start.

30:30.530 --> 30:32.697
Mrs. Vanelli?

30:32.699 --> 30:34.599
I'm happy to say
that the surgery went well.

30:34.601 --> 30:36.033
Santina's recovering nicely.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.935
Sta bene!

30:37.937 --> 30:39.471
Santina Sta bene!

30:46.946 --> 30:48.178
Thank you.

30:49.782 --> 30:53.417
You're welcome.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.122
Billy, I just got your message.

30:58.124 --> 31:00.290
- You missed the whole surgery.
- Cassie,

31:00.292 --> 31:01.993
we have a problem.

31:01.995 --> 31:04.794
I sent that message.

31:04.796 --> 31:07.097
I think we need to clear the air.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.500
- What are you doing here?
- You can leave, bro.

31:09.502 --> 31:11.768
I just need to talk to her alone
for a few minutes.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.172
I-I can't do...

31:15.174 --> 31:16.573
Please!

31:16.575 --> 31:19.809
I'm trying to be a gentleman here.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.879
Jake, I, um...

31:22.881 --> 31:25.548
I'm so sorry if you thought
that there was something more

31:25.550 --> 31:27.017
going on between us. I...

31:27.019 --> 31:29.886
"Apollo, Apollo! God of all ways,"

31:29.888 --> 31:31.554
"but only Death's to me,"

31:31.556 --> 31:34.190
"Once and again,
thou, Destroyer named..."

31:34.192 --> 31:37.560
"Thou hast destroyed me,"

31:37.562 --> 31:40.663
- "thou, my love of old!"
- No.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.434
No. It's just a myth.

31:45.436 --> 31:47.570
It's just a-a story

31:47.572 --> 31:49.205
that people tell and... and retell,

31:49.207 --> 31:52.475
and everyone in-interprets it
a little differently.

31:52.477 --> 31:55.210
- Do you understand what I'm...
- I know what love is!

31:55.212 --> 31:58.513
It's epic and messy.

31:58.515 --> 32:02.184
And this here, this misunderstanding...

32:02.186 --> 32:03.952
It's just one part in our odyssey.

32:03.954 --> 32:06.789
This isn't a story.

32:06.791 --> 32:08.657
Jake,

32:08.659 --> 32:11.459
I am a doctor,
and you are a patient of mine,

32:11.461 --> 32:13.361
and that's all this ever was.

32:15.999 --> 32:18.533
You've changed, Cassandra.

32:18.535 --> 32:21.469
You're different
than last time I was here.

32:21.471 --> 32:24.406
I think it's maybe this place
or him, but...

32:28.144 --> 32:29.811
- It's him, isn't it?
- No.

32:29.813 --> 32:31.579
I put myself out there for you.

32:31.581 --> 32:33.181
At least tell me the truth, Cassandra!

32:33.183 --> 32:34.381
- Ugh!
- No! Billy!

32:34.383 --> 32:35.583
Billy!

32:40.489 --> 32:42.590
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

32:45.160 --> 32:46.993
We have to help him.

32:46.995 --> 32:50.431
Call down. Get an O.R.

32:50.433 --> 32:52.132
Billy!

32:55.204 --> 32:57.371
Stay with me.

33:00.966 --> 33:03.735
I don't appreciate
how you all went about it,

33:03.737 --> 33:06.570
taking advantage of my
generally agreeable nature.

33:06.572 --> 33:08.072
Bishop.

33:08.074 --> 33:09.540
But I can't argue with the result.

33:09.542 --> 33:11.742
Does that mean you're gonna
certify us to do the Sugarbaker?

33:11.744 --> 33:12.910
I'll talk to Dr. Johnson.

33:12.912 --> 33:14.912
Dr. Kinney, I need you!

33:16.916 --> 33:19.951
What the hell happened?

33:19.953 --> 33:23.119
36-year-old male, impalement
in the lower-right quadrant.

33:23.121 --> 33:24.521
Williams, I got this.

33:24.523 --> 33:25.889
- No way.
- If he doesn't make it,

33:25.891 --> 33:28.024
it'll look like malpractice,
like you wanted it to happen.

33:28.026 --> 33:30.093
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Oh, you have a bright future.

33:30.095 --> 33:33.764
- Don't screw it up.
- I'm not letting him die, Dana.

33:33.766 --> 33:35.098
Where do you need me?

33:35.100 --> 33:38.001
Here. Retract.

33:38.003 --> 33:39.669
Thank you.

33:45.743 --> 33:47.810
I got your message.

33:47.812 --> 33:49.612
You wanted to see me?

33:49.614 --> 33:53.450
I wanted to say that I'm sorry,

33:53.452 --> 33:57.019
and also that I named him Hamza.

33:57.021 --> 33:58.754
I'm sure you know what it means.

33:58.756 --> 34:01.557
Steadfast, strong and steadfast.

34:01.559 --> 34:04.460
Like a lion.

34:04.462 --> 34:06.395
Thank you, Dr. Hamza,

34:06.397 --> 34:09.398
for supporting my decision
when no one else did.

34:31.420 --> 34:34.422
Babe.

34:34.424 --> 34:38.192
Where have you been? I've been waiting.

34:38.194 --> 34:40.529
Shahir, I ran through the hospital

34:40.531 --> 34:42.362
searching for our abducted baby,

34:42.364 --> 34:43.831
and I got interviewed by the Cops.

34:43.833 --> 34:45.632
Please do not shut me out right now.

34:45.635 --> 34:47.335
She didn't abduct him. She...

34:47.337 --> 34:48.835
She just panicked.

34:48.838 --> 34:51.938
If anything,
she proved today she's unfit.

34:53.976 --> 34:55.376
Jonathan, I gave her my word

34:55.378 --> 34:57.711
that we wouldn't pursue the adoption.

34:59.882 --> 35:03.851
- You what?
- She's his mother, Jonathan.

35:03.853 --> 35:06.353
And when a mother says
that she wants her baby...

35:11.594 --> 35:14.294
I know how bad you wanted this. I...

35:14.296 --> 35:18.265
I know how much
you wanted to be a father.

35:18.267 --> 35:19.999
- And I wanted to be a father, too.
- Oh, don't.

35:20.001 --> 35:21.634
- I...
- Don't!

35:21.636 --> 35:25.305
Wanted to be a father with you.

35:25.307 --> 35:27.541
It's just...

35:27.543 --> 35:28.908
It's too much.

35:28.910 --> 35:30.977
It's too much. I...

35:33.282 --> 35:37.016
My heart can't take it anymore.

35:37.018 --> 35:38.585
Baby, I'm sorry. I...

35:38.587 --> 35:40.319
No.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.461
All right, he's in recovery in the ward

35:48.463 --> 35:50.162
with a full security detail.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.466
You know, you think you know
where you life is going,

35:53.468 --> 35:55.667
and you work hard,

35:55.669 --> 35:58.571
and you apply yourself.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.439
What's the point?

36:00.441 --> 36:02.774
Williams,

36:02.776 --> 36:07.446
you are one of the strongest,
most determined women I know,

36:07.448 --> 36:10.082
and one of the most talented
young surgeons

36:10.084 --> 36:12.050
to come through this hospital
in a while.

36:13.320 --> 36:16.855
So, if Dr. Johnson
doesn't want to mentor you,

36:16.857 --> 36:18.523
then to hell with her.

36:18.525 --> 36:20.959
Because I will.

36:20.961 --> 36:22.494
Thank you, Dr. Kinney.

36:22.496 --> 36:24.996
- You okay?
- Yes, she's fine.

36:24.998 --> 36:26.264
And your Boss is an idiot

36:26.266 --> 36:28.199
if she doesn't pick her
to be her new resident.

36:28.201 --> 36:29.700
- Dana...
- Which is exactly what I told her.

36:29.702 --> 36:31.136
Oh.

36:31.138 --> 36:32.770
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Johnson,

36:32.772 --> 36:34.405
and she knows everything
that happened today.

36:34.407 --> 36:35.473
She...

36:35.475 --> 36:38.643
She wants you in New York by Tuesday.

36:40.547 --> 36:41.646
Just say yes, sweetheart.

36:41.648 --> 36:42.813
Yes. Yes!

36:42.815 --> 36:43.814
- Yes.
- Yes!

36:43.816 --> 36:46.216
Oh, my God.

36:46.218 --> 36:48.119
- Oh, my God!
- Wow.

36:48.121 --> 36:49.353
All right, well, if you excuse me,

36:49.355 --> 36:52.222
I've got an impromptu
farewell party to plan.

36:58.664 --> 37:00.897
When I left here,

37:00.899 --> 37:03.833
the way I left...

37:03.835 --> 37:07.704
You deserved better than that.

37:07.706 --> 37:10.840
Yeah, I did.

37:10.842 --> 37:13.977
But if it makes you feel better,
my ex completely hosed me...

37:13.979 --> 37:16.579
took everything.

37:16.581 --> 37:18.715
It does, actually. Thank you.

37:21.452 --> 37:22.819
You know I'm not gonna
be your girlfriend

37:22.821 --> 37:24.921
when I move to New York, right?

37:24.923 --> 37:26.522
Oh, I know.

37:26.524 --> 37:30.060
And, hey, I promise I will never
stand in your way again.

37:30.062 --> 37:31.627
What does that mean?

37:31.629 --> 37:33.762
I'm not going back.

37:33.764 --> 37:36.965
My contract
with Dr. Johnson's up, so...

37:36.967 --> 37:40.670
New York's all yours.

37:40.672 --> 37:42.905
You're gonna be amazing, Cassie.

37:57.287 --> 37:58.887
I'm gonna be able to come now.

37:58.889 --> 38:00.889
They're happy.

38:00.891 --> 38:03.425
So, why do you look like
you're going to a funeral?

38:05.395 --> 38:08.496
I have given up so much
for this hospital,

38:08.498 --> 38:10.965
for this job, and for what?

38:10.967 --> 38:13.067
There's no respect from the Board.

38:13.069 --> 38:16.170
Even my top resident wants out of here.

38:16.172 --> 38:19.507
This hospital wouldn't survive
five minutes without you.

38:19.509 --> 38:20.674
It's true.

38:20.676 --> 38:23.044
Everybody knows it, even you.

38:23.046 --> 38:25.246
Hey. Looks like the surgery went well.

38:25.248 --> 38:26.748
Congratulations.

38:28.752 --> 38:31.452
Take me home.

38:31.454 --> 38:32.954
Okay.

38:37.226 --> 38:38.925
Here she is.

38:38.927 --> 38:40.794
Hey, hey!

38:40.796 --> 38:42.062
Oww, oww!

38:42.064 --> 38:43.830
Best we could do
at the last minute.

38:43.832 --> 38:45.633
Thank you. I love it.

38:45.635 --> 38:47.968
I had these in the trunk.
They're warm, but they're beer.

38:47.970 --> 38:49.470
And for those who prefer something

38:49.472 --> 38:51.138
with a little more kick...

38:51.140 --> 38:53.240
- Whoo-hoo!
- You anesthesiologists...

38:53.242 --> 38:55.575
- always something up your sleeve.
- Oh, you know it.

38:55.577 --> 38:58.011
Wow.

38:58.013 --> 39:00.513
Thank you for saving him,

39:00.515 --> 39:03.250
and my career.

39:03.252 --> 39:06.386
Promise me you'll apply yourself
a little more, yeah?

39:06.388 --> 39:09.222
Sure thing, Mom.

39:11.025 --> 39:14.661
To Cassie, everyone,

39:14.663 --> 39:16.396
whose future is as bright

39:16.398 --> 39:19.365
as that smile I'm gonna miss so much.

39:19.367 --> 39:20.833
- Cin cin.
- L'chaim!

39:20.835 --> 39:22.568
Cheers, honey.

39:27.675 --> 39:28.640
Hey.

39:28.642 --> 39:31.110
Hey.

39:31.112 --> 39:33.846
I'm gonna miss you the most.

39:33.848 --> 39:35.080
Yeah, you better.

39:37.218 --> 39:38.217
Okay, here.

39:39.854 --> 39:42.654
- Oh, God.
- You need one of these.

39:57.971 --> 40:00.805
Jacob, Oliver,
w-what are you guys doing here?

40:00.807 --> 40:02.874
Dad told us about your big surgery.

40:02.876 --> 40:04.742
Thought you'd be hungry after.

40:04.744 --> 40:06.544
They're making their specialty.

40:06.546 --> 40:08.279
Mango and Nutella sandwiches.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.348
It's almost not as gross

40:10.350 --> 40:11.716
as it sounds.

40:11.718 --> 40:14.185
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

40:14.187 --> 40:16.387
I just...

40:16.389 --> 40:18.188
I have to make a call first.

40:25.865 --> 40:27.631
Mrs. Crace, it's Dawn Bell.

40:27.633 --> 40:29.199
It's about my appointment as Chief.

40:29.201 --> 40:31.802
I'd like to renegotiate.

40:31.804 --> 40:34.204
I would like a five-year
guaranteed contract,

40:34.206 --> 40:36.706
more resources for the O.R.,

40:36.708 --> 40:40.277
a pay raise...

40:40.279 --> 40:42.913
and I would like six weeks of vacation

40:42.915 --> 40:44.948
to spend with my family.

40:46.919 --> 40:48.885
I look forward
to your response tomorrow.

40:48.887 --> 40:50.353
Good night.

40:57.295 --> 41:00.663
Primaveri, rigatoni, calamari.

41:00.665 --> 41:03.165
Boccacino, Pavarotti, Scorcese,

41:03.167 --> 41:06.735
Al Pacino in "Del Godfather-oni,
I, II, and III."

41:06.737 --> 41:08.737
Hey, welcome home, Cara Mia!

41:08.739 --> 41:10.239
It's so festive in here.

41:10.241 --> 41:11.974
Mm, well, you had a big day,

41:11.976 --> 41:13.809
- and I was feeling inspired, so...
- I did.

41:13.811 --> 41:15.744
- Oh.
- Mm.

41:15.746 --> 41:16.745
Mmm.

41:16.747 --> 41:17.746
- Mm?
- Wow.

41:17.748 --> 41:19.348
Am I right? I'm right. Mmm.

41:19.350 --> 41:20.783
Where did you get that recipe?

41:20.785 --> 41:23.018
Well,

41:23.020 --> 41:27.055
let's just say
I have friends in high places.

41:27.057 --> 41:29.892
Me, too.

41:29.894 --> 41:32.461
I got this from our patient.

41:32.463 --> 41:34.530
She said it would bring
the baby good luck.

41:34.532 --> 41:38.166
And we need all the luck we can get.

41:38.168 --> 41:39.467
You look different.

41:39.469 --> 41:41.702
I'm happy.

41:41.704 --> 41:43.238
It looks good on you.

41:43.240 --> 41:45.640
Well, I did some soul searching today,

41:45.642 --> 41:48.810
and I realized that, um,

41:48.812 --> 41:51.913
everything I've ever wanted

41:51.915 --> 41:55.115
is right here.

41:55.117 --> 41:57.251
I did some soul searching, too,

41:57.253 --> 42:00.755
and I don't want another day to
go by without us being a family.

42:00.757 --> 42:02.790
Baby, we are a family.

42:07.229 --> 42:09.797
Marry me, Charlie?

42:09.799 --> 42:12.066
For real this time.

42:17.873 --> 42:20.674
Alex Reid,

42:20.676 --> 42:23.944
you are gonna make
an honest man out of me.

42:26.148 --> 42:28.181
Absolutely.
