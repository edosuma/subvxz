- Hey, Ash.

06:00.385 --> 06:02.140
- Hi Sammy. How's it going?

06:02.190 --> 06:04.510
- Other than being attacked by

06:04.560 --> 06:08.733
three bloodsucking ticks, not too bad.

06:11.040 --> 06:11.980
What do we got today?

06:12.030 --> 06:14.880
- There's a woman coming in
at 9:00 that needs your help.

06:15.990 --> 06:18.190
- Did she say about what?
- She didn't say.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.670
She said she wants to tell you in person.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.320
- Okay.

06:44.220 --> 06:46.360
Hi, I'm Sammy.

06:46.410 --> 06:49.690
Sammy Slick, and yes, that's my real name.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.753
I'm a vampire-hunting private eye.

06:52.590 --> 06:55.090
I kinda wanna set all this up for you.

06:55.140 --> 06:58.030
Yes, vampires are real,

06:58.080 --> 07:01.803
but they're not exactly what
you see in movies and TV.

07:05.010 --> 07:06.490
Yes, they have fangs.

07:06.540 --> 07:08.343
Yes, they feed on human blood.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.800
No, they don't cast reflections,

07:11.850 --> 07:13.840
as you saw earlier.

07:13.890 --> 07:15.670
Let's see, what else? What else?

07:15.720 --> 07:18.328
Oh, they actually enjoy garlic.

07:18.378 --> 07:20.961
(upbeat music)

07:29.760 --> 07:33.093
Vamps do have to be
invited into your home.

07:33.930 --> 07:35.440
Let's see, what else?

07:35.490 --> 07:36.940
Oh, the cool stuff.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.910
You do kill them with
a stake to the heart,

07:39.960 --> 07:42.010
as you saw earlier.

07:42.060 --> 07:44.410
I actually get mine specially made.

07:44.460 --> 07:46.150
If it's a silver stake (snaps)

07:46.200 --> 07:48.543
poof, they burst into dust.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.870
You can kill them other ways
too, but it's a bloody mess.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.880
And I just prefer my way.

07:54.930 --> 07:56.913
No muss, no fuss.

07:58.410 --> 07:59.643
What else? Oh.

08:00.870 --> 08:05.493
The strange thing about
these little bastards,

08:06.330 --> 08:08.080
they have this weird smell.

08:08.130 --> 08:12.190
You'd think it's this
nasty-ass smell, like decay.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.783
It, it's more like lavender.

08:17.820 --> 08:19.420
Disgusting.

08:19.470 --> 08:20.800
They're charming.

08:20.850 --> 08:22.278
They can talk their way into any room

08:22.320 --> 08:23.628
and make you believe their bullshit

08:23.670 --> 08:25.203
without even really trying.

08:26.610 --> 08:29.080
They could care less about
a cross in their face.

08:29.130 --> 08:32.440
Holy water doesn't do shit.
I've seen them drink it.

08:32.490 --> 08:34.000
What else?

08:34.049 --> 08:36.220
As far as sunlight, they
can go out in sunlight.

08:36.270 --> 08:39.010
They just prefer to prowl around at night.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.600
Less people,

08:40.650 --> 08:43.570
easier to catch their
victims, shadows to hide in.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.020
You know, that old chestnut.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.550
Let's see, a bit about me.

08:48.600 --> 08:52.263
I've been a vampire hunter
for about four years now.

08:53.340 --> 08:58.338
I'm a vampire slaying, monster
hunting, martial arts expert.

08:58.380 --> 09:01.563
And if you've got a problem
with vampires, come see me.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.300
I hate,

09:04.350 --> 09:08.313
I repeat, I fucking hate vampires.

09:12.810 --> 09:14.103
Thank you for listening.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.350
(knocking)

09:17.400 --> 09:18.303
Yes, Ash.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.220
- Your appointment is here.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.293
- Cool. Send her in.

09:25.170 --> 09:26.500
Have a seat, Miss

09:26.550 --> 09:27.400
- Shana.

09:27.450 --> 09:28.750
- Shana, nice to meet you.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.500
So what can I do for you?

09:32.550 --> 09:35.170
- Well, I came in because I heard around

09:35.220 --> 09:37.030
that you're a vampire hunter

09:37.080 --> 09:40.180
and, well, I think my boss is one.

09:40.230 --> 09:41.390
- What makes you think that?

09:41.440 --> 09:45.280
- Well, like, you see,
I'm a dancer at Foxy's.

09:45.330 --> 09:46.380
- Oh, the strip club.

09:47.430 --> 09:49.810
I've been, like by there before.

09:49.860 --> 09:51.130
Sorry.

09:51.180 --> 09:52.690
Continue, please.

09:52.740 --> 09:55.330
- Anyways, about two weeks ago,

09:55.380 --> 09:57.040
we got a new owner, you see?

09:57.090 --> 10:00.400
And ever since then, weird
things have been happening.

10:00.450 --> 10:01.690
- Like?

10:01.740 --> 10:04.360
- Well, like you see, our regulars,

10:04.410 --> 10:06.250
they've all gone missing.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.560
And these are guys

10:08.610 --> 10:12.010
that used to come in
every night for, for years

10:12.060 --> 10:14.560
and, and now they're just gone.

10:14.610 --> 10:17.110
And I haven't seen them for weeks.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.790
- Well, it's peculiar,

10:18.840 --> 10:21.730
but it doesn't necessarily
mean that she's a vampire.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.310
- Just wait. It gets better.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.423
So last night, I go out back
to have a smoke break, you see?

10:28.394 --> 10:31.394
(suspenseful music)

10:58.032 --> 11:01.865
(suspenseful music continues)

11:13.087 --> 11:16.000
And there you have it. She's a vampire.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.478
- And this is what you
think has been happening

11:17.520 --> 11:19.510
to your customers over the past few days?

11:19.560 --> 11:21.370
- That's exactly what I think.

11:21.420 --> 11:23.080
Which means less tips for me.

11:23.130 --> 11:24.873
And I got a kid, you know?

11:26.160 --> 11:27.310
- Understandable.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.070
Well, I'll do some digging
and I'll try and see

11:30.120 --> 11:32.380
what's going on over there at, um

11:32.430 --> 11:33.580
- Foxy's.
- Right.

11:33.630 --> 11:34.863
Over at Foxy's.

11:35.910 --> 11:37.600
Thank you for coming in, Miss Shana.

11:37.650 --> 11:39.150
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it.

11:49.350 --> 11:50.290
- You get all that?

11:50.340 --> 11:53.080
- Loud and clear. You
want me to go with you?

11:53.130 --> 11:55.300
- No, I think a chick in a strip club

11:55.350 --> 11:57.340
draws a little bit too much attention.

11:57.390 --> 11:59.860
- You know what else draws attention?

11:59.910 --> 12:00.820
- [Sammy] What?

12:00.870 --> 12:04.300
- A vampire investigator
going to a strip club

12:04.350 --> 12:06.993
owned and operated by vampires.

12:08.670 --> 12:09.970
- Touche.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.810
- Well, someday you'll take me
with you and be glad you did.

12:13.860 --> 12:16.960
Until then, I will just do my paperwork.

12:17.010 --> 12:19.180
- Someday, Ash. Someday.

12:19.230 --> 12:22.373
- See ya.
(doorbell ringing)

12:24.256 --> 12:26.756
(dance music)

12:54.048 --> 12:57.381
(dance music continues)

13:06.420 --> 13:08.260
- How's it going, man?
- Pretty good.

13:08.310 --> 13:11.500
- Good. You, you know who owns this place?

13:11.550 --> 13:13.658
- Nah, man. Some chick, I think.

13:13.708 --> 13:15.021
- I got ya.

13:15.071 --> 13:18.404
(dance music continues)

13:54.120 --> 13:55.210
So what's your name?

13:55.260 --> 13:56.680
- Roxy. What's your name?

13:56.730 --> 13:57.563
- Sammy.

14:01.320 --> 14:04.840
Roxy, you know who owns this place?

14:04.890 --> 14:06.580
- Yeah, her name is Sophia.

14:06.630 --> 14:08.280
She bought it a couple weeks ago.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.960
- Gotcha.

14:11.010 --> 14:13.000
You know if she's here tonight?

14:13.050 --> 14:15.600
- I haven't seen her. She's
usually inside and out.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.553
Oh wait, there she is.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.830
- Thank you, Roxy.
- Mm-hm.

14:31.230 --> 14:33.430
- Hi. I don't believe
I've seen you here before.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.720
First time?

14:34.770 --> 14:37.000
- Not first time, but it's been a while.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.530
- Well, thank you for coming back.

14:38.580 --> 14:40.480
I'm the new owner, Sophia.

14:40.530 --> 14:41.363
- Sammy.

14:43.020 --> 14:44.050
- Pleasure.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.970
Let me know if you need anything, Sammy.

14:46.020 --> 14:46.853
- Will do.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.900
(dance music)

15:03.226 --> 15:05.476
(knocking)

15:09.657 --> 15:12.423
(knocking)

15:12.473 --> 15:13.640
What the fuck?

15:19.387 --> 15:20.650
Who is it?

15:20.700 --> 15:21.573
- Delivery.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.450
I need you to sign right here for me, sir.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.950
- I gotcha. Here, come on in

15:30.000 --> 15:31.278
and just put it right over there.

15:31.320 --> 15:32.153
- Yep.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.684
(bell dings)

15:38.688 --> 15:39.521
- Shit.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.800
(man growling)

15:42.850 --> 15:45.600
(dramatic music)

15:50.571 --> 15:53.238
(man screaming)

16:00.717 --> 16:02.823
Who needs coffee for a morning wake up?

16:07.470 --> 16:08.470
Hi, Ash.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.730
- Hi, Sammy.

16:09.780 --> 16:11.950
Thank you. You take such good care of me.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.833
- I try.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.473
- How'd it go at the club last night?

16:16.350 --> 16:17.440
- Pretty well.

16:17.490 --> 16:18.970
I actually met the owner lady.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.793
- Are you sure she is one?

16:21.840 --> 16:23.620
- What? An owner? Yeah, I'm sure.

16:23.670 --> 16:26.200
- No, dumbass, a vamp.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.340
- I'm just joshing.

16:27.390 --> 16:29.560
Yeah, I'm positive. She
wreaked of lavender.

16:29.610 --> 16:30.528
- It's so weird, right?

16:30.570 --> 16:32.830
Like why the fuck do they smell like that?

16:32.880 --> 16:35.110
- I don't know. It's
better than onions though.

16:35.160 --> 16:35.993
- Yeah.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.193
- So anyways, she was
actually really nice to me.

16:42.660 --> 16:45.220
But she was talking with
the guy that I saw earlier

16:45.270 --> 16:46.900
and it's the one that attacked me.

16:46.950 --> 16:50.680
So when I saw him, I just split.

16:50.730 --> 16:51.910
- So she knows?

16:51.960 --> 16:54.160
- Yeah, I didn't even
tell you the best part.

16:54.210 --> 16:56.740
I got attacked in my
apartment this morning.

16:56.790 --> 16:59.470
The fucking dick posed
as a delivery driver.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.373
- During the day? Holy
shit, they're getting bold.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.968
- We're gonna have to
look out for each other.

17:05.010 --> 17:06.670
I mean, sooner or later,

17:06.720 --> 17:09.250
they're gonna know
exactly who you are too.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.553
- What? A stupid secretary?

17:13.920 --> 17:15.453
- No, part of the team.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.690
- Yay. I'm part of the team?

17:19.740 --> 17:22.930
I get to sit here all day and
click clack on the keyboard

17:22.980 --> 17:25.771
and do your paperwork. (laughs)

17:25.820 --> 17:27.819
You know, I'm more than that, you know?

17:27.869 --> 17:28.780
- Like what?

17:28.830 --> 17:32.043
- Let's just say I'm like a Transformer.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.363
More than meets the eye.

17:38.076 --> 17:40.110
- Oh yeah, yeah. Okay.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.060
I, I blew that one like
an old Atari cartridge.

17:43.110 --> 17:43.943
- Yeah, you did.

17:44.970 --> 17:47.200
- Um, here's the thing.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.530
What if that girl,
Shana, was a vampire too?

17:50.580 --> 17:52.390
She's trying to spread information

17:52.440 --> 17:54.660
back to the, the strip club owner.

17:54.710 --> 17:58.417
- I mean, it's a possibility.

17:58.467 --> 18:01.000
- And she was wearing
perfume too, so it's like,

18:01.050 --> 18:03.220
I don't even know if she
smelled like lavender.

18:03.270 --> 18:04.360
- Oh, yeah.

18:04.410 --> 18:06.018
- We might have to stay together tonight.

18:06.060 --> 18:08.373
You know, for protection.

18:09.210 --> 18:11.800
- If you're trying to sleep
with me, you could just ask.

18:11.850 --> 18:12.683
- Really?

18:13.590 --> 18:15.850
- No, I'm just fucking with you.

18:15.900 --> 18:18.940
No, I think it's a good
idea if we stick together.

18:18.990 --> 18:20.380
Your place or mine?

18:20.430 --> 18:23.740
- Mine because I have all my
vampire killing stuff there.

18:23.790 --> 18:25.443
Checkmate.
- Obviously.

18:26.790 --> 18:27.623
- Let's go.

18:37.977 --> 18:40.630
(suspenseful music)
Did you hear something?

18:40.680 --> 18:41.930
- I didn't hear anything.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.023
- All right, let's keep going.

18:49.434 --> 18:52.270
(suspenseful music)
- And paranoia sets in

18:52.320 --> 18:55.994
as the two walk through the
dark streets of Ybor City.

18:56.044 --> 18:57.820
Dun, dun, dun.
- All right, all right.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.416
Very funny.

18:59.466 --> 19:01.180
What do you wanna get to eat?

19:01.230 --> 19:02.748
- I'm good with anything.
How about Italian?

19:02.790 --> 19:05.590
- Ooh, there's a good Italian
place that I know up here.

19:07.430 --> 19:09.930
(man yelling)

19:11.598 --> 19:14.181
(body hissing)

19:16.620 --> 19:18.423
- Holy fucking shit.

19:20.100 --> 19:24.343
- I told you. I'm Optimus
Prime, bitch. (laughs)

19:25.920 --> 19:28.030
- Wow. Was that a makeup pencil? What the?

19:28.080 --> 19:31.193
- Yeah, I gotta keep my eyebrows on fleek.

19:32.550 --> 19:33.858
You've known me for like a month.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.900
There's so much you don't know about me.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.170
- Obviously.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.933
Motherfucker.

19:41.239 --> 19:43.822
(Ash laughing)

19:51.720 --> 19:53.163
So tell me about yourself.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.930
We don't really have a lot of time

19:55.980 --> 19:58.420
to get to know each other outside of work.

19:58.470 --> 20:00.820
- Well, I'm from St. Louis,
but you already knew that.

20:00.870 --> 20:02.020
- Mm.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.270
What made you move here?

20:07.260 --> 20:09.610
- Went through a really bad breakup

20:09.660 --> 20:13.233
and was looking for
someplace to start over,

20:14.340 --> 20:15.993
so I just kind of went for it.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.000
- Sorry to hear about your breakup.

20:19.050 --> 20:22.210
- Don't be. That guy was a
douche. Long time coming.

20:22.260 --> 20:23.310
- Fuck that guy then.

20:24.270 --> 20:26.320
So what did you do before you moved here?

20:29.820 --> 20:31.143
- I hunted vampires.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.173
- I'm sorry, what did you just say?

20:39.060 --> 20:41.043
- I hunted vampires.

20:43.860 --> 20:45.400
- You're shitting me.

20:45.450 --> 20:48.460
- I am not shitting you.

20:48.510 --> 20:50.830
I'm a bad motherfucker, Sammy Slick.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.500
- Given what you pulled off earlier today,

20:53.550 --> 20:55.548
I'd have to say I agree.

20:55.598 --> 20:58.181
(Ash laughing)

21:00.180 --> 21:02.560
So wait.

21:02.610 --> 21:05.830
Obviously, you didn't just
apply for some random job

21:05.880 --> 21:07.413
that I had posted.

21:08.550 --> 21:11.080
- No, I, I did some research.

21:11.130 --> 21:12.663
Found out who you are.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.860
You know, the network
is all really connected.

21:18.060 --> 21:21.730
I just, I thought it would
be cool to have a partner.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.970
Vampire hunting can get
pretty lonely sometimes.

21:25.020 --> 21:25.863
- That it can.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.443
- So what do you think?

21:30.380 --> 21:31.960
- About what?

21:32.010 --> 21:33.153
- You want a partner?

21:37.770 --> 21:38.673
- Okay, sure.

21:39.570 --> 21:40.533
We'll be partners.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.195
But you're the fucking sidekick.

21:44.245 --> 21:47.170
(Ash laughing)

21:47.220 --> 21:48.270
- I'm cool with that.

22:56.820 --> 22:57.693
Hi.

22:58.922 --> 23:00.381
(man yelling)

23:00.431 --> 23:03.014
(body hissing)

23:06.380 --> 23:08.532
- Oh. Oh shit.

23:08.582 --> 23:10.415
- Hoo! This is badass.

23:11.353 --> 23:13.720
I gotta get me one of these.

23:13.770 --> 23:16.090
- How the fuck

23:17.100 --> 23:18.580
did that thing get in here?

23:18.630 --> 23:19.720
- Front door, my dude.

23:19.770 --> 23:21.760
You might wanna get some better locks.

23:21.810 --> 23:23.470
- Obviously.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.353
Shit.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.830
You saved my life.

23:26.880 --> 23:27.843
- Twice.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.390
- Yeah, yeah.
(Ash laughing)

23:31.440 --> 23:33.550
Thank you for that, by the way.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.980
- You sure you don't
wanna be the sidekick?

23:36.030 --> 23:36.940
- Funny.

23:36.990 --> 23:40.690
- You know, I'll be Optimus
and you can be Bumblebee.

23:40.740 --> 23:42.460
Shut your mouth and fight shit.

23:42.510 --> 23:45.070
- Shut up.
(Ash laughing)

23:45.120 --> 23:46.323
- Nice panties.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.673
- Thank you.

24:01.860 --> 24:02.883
Fuck.

24:05.730 --> 24:06.563
I gotta move.

24:11.298 --> 24:14.048
(birds chirping)

24:22.770 --> 24:23.603
Morning.

24:26.726 --> 24:29.020
- Morning. How'd you sleep?

24:29.070 --> 24:32.350
- I fucking didn't after
that bullshit last night.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.090
- You gotta relax.

24:34.140 --> 24:38.950
- I got attacked in my own
apartment twice in one day.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.900
Excuse me if I'm a little bit on edge.

24:42.570 --> 24:44.230
You want anything?

24:44.280 --> 24:45.123
- Hmm.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.633
How about $1 million,

24:49.740 --> 24:54.040
a private jet that'll take
me anywhere I wanna go

24:54.090 --> 24:56.980
and a good man to share
my adventures with?

24:57.030 --> 24:58.090
- Mm.

24:58.140 --> 25:01.750
Well, I can give you the good
man and plenty of adventures.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.250
The rest, you're on your own.

25:04.290 --> 25:05.793
- Oh, Sammy, that was sweet.

25:08.992 --> 25:10.960
Do you mind if I take a shower?

25:11.010 --> 25:13.323
- Yeah, yeah, it, it's right over here.

25:20.343 --> 25:23.260
(mirror squeaking)

25:28.950 --> 25:30.280
Oh, God. Sorry.

25:30.330 --> 25:31.810
- Oh, no, you're fine. I'm not naked.

25:31.860 --> 25:32.760
- Yeah, but still.

25:33.870 --> 25:35.358
Look, I think I'm gonna
go back to Foxy's tonight

25:35.400 --> 25:36.250
and snoop around.

25:37.110 --> 25:37.943
Wanna come?

25:39.360 --> 25:41.110
- Oh, what? It's suddenly not weird

25:41.160 --> 25:42.810
for a girl to be in a strip club?

25:44.070 --> 25:45.670
- It was dumb of me to say that.

25:46.620 --> 25:48.820
If you wanna come, you can come.

25:48.870 --> 25:51.410
- Well, since I have your permission.

25:51.460 --> 25:54.577
- God, I didn't mean it like that.

25:54.627 --> 25:58.000
- I'm just busting your balls.
Of course, I'll be there.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.560
We're a team now.

25:59.610 --> 26:00.443
- Cool.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.320
Put some clothes on.

26:15.981 --> 26:18.898
(doorbell ringing)

26:19.771 --> 26:22.354
(door closing)

26:38.310 --> 26:39.843
Hey again.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.233
Another thing about vampires,

26:44.130 --> 26:47.140
have I told you that I loathe them?

26:47.190 --> 26:48.023
Well, I do.

26:49.500 --> 26:52.300
Vampires have been slowly
trying to take over the world.

26:53.190 --> 26:56.260
About six years ago,

26:56.310 --> 26:57.670
there was an organization

26:57.720 --> 27:00.580
that created a division called the VI.

27:00.630 --> 27:03.010
It stands for Vampire Investigators.

27:03.060 --> 27:04.480
I know.

27:04.530 --> 27:09.530
I joined the VI about four years ago.

27:09.690 --> 27:11.770
The training is rigorous,

27:11.820 --> 27:13.293
but I made it through.

27:14.550 --> 27:17.110
Standing here before you as Sammy Slick,

27:17.160 --> 27:20.620
vampire investigator, martial arts expert.

27:20.670 --> 27:21.543
Let's see.

27:24.030 --> 27:25.980
They're little ticks is the thing, like

27:27.240 --> 27:29.050
they see humans as cattle.

27:29.100 --> 27:31.953
Nothing more than, you
know, something to feast on.

27:33.990 --> 27:37.990
Once they bite you, they
don't turn you into a vampire.

27:38.040 --> 27:41.583
They kind of just drain
you of all your fluids.

27:43.410 --> 27:44.913
Yeah, that too.

27:45.930 --> 27:48.070
Vampires, procreate, just like humans do.

27:48.120 --> 27:50.073
But they don't cross breed with humans.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.760
However, they do engage in
sexual acts with the odd human.

27:54.810 --> 27:57.610
And like I said, they're horny fuckers.

27:57.660 --> 28:00.423
They usually just suck
the person dry afterwards.

28:01.410 --> 28:02.493
No pun intended.

28:04.740 --> 28:06.730
Let's see, what else?

28:06.780 --> 28:10.000
Okay, so there's two types of coven heads.

28:10.050 --> 28:13.510
There's a male vampire coven
head called the Neonate.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.543
Usually under 50 years old.

28:16.440 --> 28:19.930
They're pretty subservient to
the female head, a Vampiress.

28:19.980 --> 28:22.113
Also usually under 50 years old.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.703
I think our friend Sophia is a Vampiress.

28:27.930 --> 28:30.880
I think she's running
game outside of Foxy's,

28:30.930 --> 28:33.340
luring in men and draining
them of their blood

28:33.390 --> 28:34.833
and their cash.

28:37.170 --> 28:39.010
You have to be absolutely sure

28:39.060 --> 28:41.268
if you're gonna try and kill
someone for being a vampire.

28:41.310 --> 28:43.960
I mean, you have to be positive.

28:44.010 --> 28:45.960
I might need a little more information.

28:47.250 --> 28:50.943
But if a coven is being
started in your town,

28:53.010 --> 28:54.310
you have to get rid of it.

29:02.130 --> 29:02.963
Now fuck off.

29:07.410 --> 29:09.190
- Looking at the reports from last week,

29:09.240 --> 29:11.500
we are definitely growing our business.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.540
- Yes, we are.

29:13.590 --> 29:16.173
The strategy we are using
seems to be working.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.080
- Well, we have a lot of girls to feed,

29:20.130 --> 29:21.460
so we're gonna need to amp it up.

29:21.510 --> 29:26.510
I'm thinking if we have six
people to feast on every night,

29:26.610 --> 29:30.190
that's 42 a week, time four,

29:30.240 --> 29:33.460
that's 168 people a month.

29:33.510 --> 29:36.550
Do you think that's
sustainable in this market?

29:36.600 --> 29:38.230
- I think so.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.840
There's a huge population here,

29:40.890 --> 29:44.740
about 110,000 males in this area.

29:44.790 --> 29:48.513
Say 30% are sex-starved scum.

29:49.530 --> 29:51.880
That's 33,000

29:51.930 --> 29:54.520
divided by 168

29:54.570 --> 29:57.340
equals 196 months.

29:57.390 --> 30:00.340
We just keep luring
them in till we're done,

30:00.390 --> 30:03.063
sell the club, and move
on to another city.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.820
- That's a good plan on the paper.

30:06.870 --> 30:09.580
- Trust me, it will work.

30:09.630 --> 30:11.710
Have I ever steered you wrong?

30:11.760 --> 30:14.530
- No, you haven't. That's
why I keep you around.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.283
So what are we gonna do with
this VI sniffing around?

30:18.990 --> 30:22.803
- I put out a hit on
him, but no luck so far.

30:24.120 --> 30:27.363
He's a pretty tough cookie,
but it will get done.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.850
- Well, it needs to.
He's like a little gnat

30:30.900 --> 30:34.210
flying around my head and fucking buzzing.

30:34.260 --> 30:35.950
- You have my word.

30:36.000 --> 30:36.873
It will get done.

30:38.250 --> 30:39.903
- You are so hot. Come here.

30:46.314 --> 30:48.760
(dance music)

30:48.810 --> 30:49.760
- What's your name?

30:50.730 --> 30:52.330
- It's Steve.

30:52.380 --> 30:54.221
- Do you like my titties?

30:54.271 --> 30:56.439
- Yeah, I like them a lot.

30:56.489 --> 30:58.826
- What else do you like?

30:58.876 --> 31:00.973
- Your eyes are amazing.

31:01.023 --> 31:03.523
(dance music)

31:31.056 --> 31:34.389
(dance music continues)

32:04.799 --> 32:06.879
- Hey, handsome. Good to see you tonight.

32:06.929 --> 32:08.846
- You look hot tonight.

32:09.900 --> 32:12.423
So, Sophia here at all?

32:13.710 --> 32:16.750
- She's in the back office.
Why are you so interested?

32:16.800 --> 32:17.591
- You can't tell anybody,

32:17.633 --> 32:20.590
but you seem like a nice girl,

32:20.640 --> 32:22.190
so I'll let you in on a secret.

32:23.070 --> 32:25.504
I think Sophia's a Vampiress.

32:25.554 --> 32:26.658
I think she's killing people

32:26.700 --> 32:28.350
and draining them of their blood.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.743
- Why would you think that?

32:31.793 --> 32:34.179
- Someone who works here told me.

32:34.229 --> 32:35.182
- Who?

32:35.232 --> 32:36.385
- Oh, I can't tell you.

32:36.435 --> 32:37.853
You know, for their safety.

32:37.903 --> 32:39.153
- Was it Shana?

32:40.860 --> 32:43.156
- No, why would you say that?

32:43.206 --> 32:45.156
- She the only one who's not one of us.

32:48.365 --> 32:50.535
(woman hissing)

32:50.585 --> 32:55.585
(women hissing)
(dance music)

32:58.822 --> 33:00.280
- Hey. Hey, wait up.

33:00.330 --> 33:01.788
- We have to get the fuck out of here.

33:01.830 --> 33:03.580
- Calm, calm down. What happened?

33:03.630 --> 33:06.483
- Ash, everyone in there is a vampire.

33:07.350 --> 33:08.830
I think I just got Shana killed.

33:08.880 --> 33:09.910
- Why?

33:09.960 --> 33:12.880
- Roxy just told me as she
flashed all of her teeth at me.

33:12.930 --> 33:13.763
- Shit.

33:14.700 --> 33:16.098
- This place is a fucking meat market.

33:16.140 --> 33:17.808
They're luring men to
their deaths in there.

33:17.850 --> 33:20.410
- Well, you knew that
already. Shana told you that.

33:20.460 --> 33:23.110
- No. Do you understand?

33:23.160 --> 33:25.090
There must be 50, 60 people a week

33:25.140 --> 33:26.650
being drained out of this place.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.450
They're luring men to their deaths.

33:29.490 --> 33:30.828
- Well, what the hell can we possibly do?

33:30.870 --> 33:32.620
We can't possibly take them all on.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.690
- Let's get back to my
place. Make a plan of attack.

33:37.740 --> 33:38.830
You hungry?

33:38.880 --> 33:40.210
- I could eat.

33:40.260 --> 33:41.564
- All right, let's go.

33:41.614 --> 33:44.114
(dance music)

34:02.577 --> 34:04.540
I don't know what to do.

34:04.590 --> 34:06.490
I mean, the only thing I can think is,

34:07.380 --> 34:10.179
I mean, what? We try to
take them out one by one

34:10.230 --> 34:11.480
after we track them down?

34:12.960 --> 34:13.751
- And that would take a while.

34:13.793 --> 34:14.626
- Take a while.

34:15.570 --> 34:18.010
- I mean, in the meantime, all
these men are getting killed.

34:18.060 --> 34:18.893
- You're right.

34:22.679 --> 34:25.510
Maybe we just take out Sophia.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.860
Remove the head, weaken
the rest of the coven.

34:31.380 --> 34:33.219
- Well, that would work.

34:33.270 --> 34:35.969
I mean, usually she's
surrounded by people, isn't she?

34:37.020 --> 34:38.520
- When is she most vulnerable?

34:39.467 --> 34:42.168
- Mm.

34:42.219 --> 34:44.822
Bed, bath.

34:46.889 --> 34:48.364
I think that's it.
- That's probably it.

34:48.407 --> 34:50.260
- [Ash] Yeah.

34:50.310 --> 34:51.850
- Okay.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.723
We follow her home. We
sneak into her house.

34:55.770 --> 34:57.893
Rub her out during the
middle of the night.

34:59.040 --> 34:59.873
Easy as pie.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.710
- Do you know if she has a partner?

35:02.760 --> 35:03.593
- No idea.

35:08.070 --> 35:09.400
- Why don't we just ask Shana?

35:09.450 --> 35:11.410
Maybe she can get us
some more information.

35:11.460 --> 35:13.593
- If she's even still alive. Fuck.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.050
- [Ash] I'm sure she's okay.

35:17.100 --> 35:19.223
- I don't feel good about
it. I'm gonna text her.

35:35.036 --> 35:36.490
Hey, good news.

35:36.540 --> 35:37.900
She said she's okay.

35:37.950 --> 35:39.820
She'll meet us at the
office at noon tomorrow.

35:39.870 --> 35:40.653
- [Ash] Okay, good.

35:40.703 --> 35:41.536
- Perfect. Perfect.

35:44.521 --> 35:46.930
Actually, no, I still
don't feel good about it.

35:46.980 --> 35:48.653
You know what I wanna do right now?

35:49.770 --> 35:51.420
- We ain't doing that, Mr. Slick.

35:52.890 --> 35:54.363
- Not that, goofy.

35:55.631 --> 35:56.595
I wanna go back to the apartment

35:56.637 --> 36:00.553
and I wanna just have a nice cold beer.

36:00.603 --> 36:01.908
- That actually sounds really good.

36:01.950 --> 36:02.783
- Yeah, right?

36:03.840 --> 36:06.183
This is not a date.

36:07.140 --> 36:07.923
Got it?

36:07.973 --> 36:10.000
- You're breaking my heart, Sammy Slick.

36:10.050 --> 36:12.063
You are breaking my heart.

36:41.528 --> 36:42.700
(bell dings)

36:42.750 --> 36:45.030
- Hey, come here.
- What?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.353
- Do you see those twins?

36:47.430 --> 36:49.480
The Marco brothers. They're Neonates.

36:49.530 --> 36:51.877
I've been after these
fucks for months. Let's go.

36:51.927 --> 36:55.344
(exciting music)
- Shit.

36:59.977 --> 37:03.994
- Get back here, you fuck.

37:04.044 --> 37:06.794
(engine running)

37:12.154 --> 37:17.154
(gun firing)
(body hissing)

37:19.625 --> 37:21.350
What was that?

37:21.400 --> 37:23.770
He got, he, he got away.

37:23.820 --> 37:24.935
- Mine didn't.

37:24.985 --> 37:29.985
- Yeah, okay. Let's go.
(Ash laughing)

37:37.361 --> 37:40.361
(suspenseful music)

38:09.120 --> 38:09.953
Hey, Ash.

38:11.801 --> 38:12.779
- Hey.

38:12.829 --> 38:14.416
- Look.

38:14.466 --> 38:17.466
(suspenseful music)

38:30.510 --> 38:31.343
Oh fuck.

38:33.300 --> 38:34.217
Shit. Fuck.

38:35.693 --> 38:37.960
- Come on, Sammy. We have
to go call the police.

38:38.010 --> 38:39.160
Come on, we have to go.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.130
- I did this, Ash. I fucking did this.

38:42.180 --> 38:43.098
- No, Sammy, you didn't do this.

38:43.140 --> 38:44.723
Come on, we have to go. We have to go.

38:51.420 --> 38:53.220
- Hey, Mike. Thanks for coming, man.

38:54.390 --> 38:55.390
- Hey, what the fuck?

38:55.440 --> 38:56.290
- I know, I.

38:57.870 --> 39:00.550
They're growing in numbers, man.

39:00.600 --> 39:01.850
It's getting out of hand.

39:03.270 --> 39:04.810
- So who's this?

39:04.860 --> 39:05.920
- Her name is Shana.

39:05.970 --> 39:08.890
She, she's the one who came
into the office the other day

39:08.940 --> 39:11.530
and told us about what's
going on down at Foxy's.

39:11.580 --> 39:13.000
- Damn.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.920
All right, I'll get a
few of my boys over here

39:14.970 --> 39:18.003
and clean this up, but you're
probably gonna have to move.

39:18.900 --> 39:20.761
- Already looking.
- All right, brother.

39:20.811 --> 39:24.393
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

39:27.567 --> 39:28.400
- You okay?

39:30.030 --> 39:31.203
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

39:43.650 --> 39:44.583
- Yes, Roman?

39:46.080 --> 39:48.333
- The message has been sent, ma'am.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.183
- Oh, Shana?

39:52.380 --> 39:53.433
- Yes, ma'am.

39:56.130 --> 39:58.240
- Shame. I liked her.

39:58.290 --> 40:00.250
Should have kept her fucking mouth shut.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.200
She would've made a lot of money here.

40:03.630 --> 40:05.733
Oh well. Thank you, Roman.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.090
- Ma'am, you have a nice evening.

40:10.140 --> 40:11.943
- Mm-hm. You as well.

40:21.300 --> 40:23.313
- Sophia, they're ready for you.

40:24.330 --> 40:26.043
- Good. I'm famished.

40:36.404 --> 40:39.404
(suspenseful music)

40:49.424 --> 40:52.257
(Sophia sniffing)

40:57.739 --> 41:00.572
(Sophia sniffing)

41:06.453 --> 41:08.740
(Sophia sniffing)

41:08.790 --> 41:10.890
- That one's mine. You can have those two.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.850
Care to join me?
- Of course.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.900
(suspenseful music)

41:49.303 --> 41:52.570
- I could really use a
good night's sleep tonight.

41:52.620 --> 41:54.722
- Well, (lock clicking)

41:54.772 --> 41:55.833
you should get one.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.430
I'm gonna shower. Would you care to

42:00.480 --> 42:02.313
- Join you? I don't think so.

42:03.630 --> 42:05.740
- I was gonna say watch the door actually.

42:05.790 --> 42:07.780
But yeah, take that tone.

42:07.830 --> 42:10.330
- Oh, um, yeah,

42:10.380 --> 42:12.790
you go shower and I will

42:12.840 --> 42:15.483
watch the apartment.

42:17.160 --> 42:17.993
- Okay.

42:21.891 --> 42:22.724
- Okay.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.730
- Hey, can I get you anything?

42:36.780 --> 42:38.350
- No, I'm good.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.900
- Okay, um,

42:40.950 --> 42:42.580
I'm gonna head to bed.

42:42.630 --> 42:44.080
Let me know if you need anything.

42:44.130 --> 42:45.230
- [Ash] Yeah.
- Okay.

42:46.170 --> 42:48.393
Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Slick.

43:15.381 --> 43:16.623
(knocking)
Hey.

43:17.880 --> 43:18.873
- Hey, what's up?

43:21.390 --> 43:22.223
- You okay?

43:25.260 --> 43:27.550
- Yeah, I'm a little shook up,

43:27.600 --> 43:29.073
but I'll be okay.

43:30.390 --> 43:32.463
- Yeah, I'm a little shook up too.

43:35.610 --> 43:37.240
Thinking about all those guys

43:37.290 --> 43:39.250
that are going to the strip club

43:39.300 --> 43:41.800
thinking it's gonna
have a happy ending and

43:43.080 --> 43:45.033
getting slaughtered instead.

43:46.920 --> 43:48.123
- Yeah, I have a

43:50.370 --> 43:55.113
very special hate in
my heart for vampires.

43:56.040 --> 43:56.873
- Personal?

43:58.710 --> 43:59.583
- Very personal.

44:01.590 --> 44:02.703
- Wanna talk about it?

44:05.160 --> 44:06.873
- Yeah, sure.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.683
So, uh,

44:15.000 --> 44:18.423
seven years ago, I wanted some cereal.

44:21.300 --> 44:22.983
It was like 9:00 at night.

44:23.910 --> 44:26.530
But you know, when the Cap'n
Crunch craving hits hard,

44:26.580 --> 44:27.980
like you just gotta have it.

44:30.510 --> 44:34.900
So I go to grab some
and we were out of milk.

44:34.950 --> 44:37.373
So my wife

44:37.423 --> 44:38.506
- [Ash] Wife?

44:40.080 --> 44:42.460
- Yeah, I was married for four years

44:42.510 --> 44:45.243
to the most amazing woman I've ever met.

44:47.310 --> 44:50.680
Anyways, I'm throwing a baby fit.

44:50.730 --> 44:51.933
We don't have any milk.

44:53.010 --> 44:54.820
Amazing wife that she is,

44:54.870 --> 44:56.650
she makes up some excuse,

44:56.700 --> 44:58.600
like she's gonna go out
and get some moisturizer

44:58.650 --> 45:01.293
or like lady face cream or something.

45:06.075 --> 45:07.575
And I, I asked her

45:09.720 --> 45:11.110
if she wanted me to go.

45:11.160 --> 45:14.673
She said, no, just stay there,

45:15.720 --> 45:17.950
get everything ready, keep the couch warm.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.730
We were gonna watch
season three of "Fargo".

45:21.780 --> 45:23.780
- [Ash] I love that show.
- Great show.

45:27.210 --> 45:30.310
So get the TV on,

45:30.360 --> 45:31.570
got my bowl,

45:31.620 --> 45:32.703
got my Cap'n Crunch,

45:33.930 --> 45:37.090
and the store is only
five minutes away, so

45:38.730 --> 45:42.573
15 minutes goes by and
I'm checking my watch.

45:44.070 --> 45:47.950
20 minutes, 30 minutes.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.720
I'm looking at the clock.

45:49.770 --> 45:51.880
So I, I give her a call

45:51.930 --> 45:53.630
and she doesn't pick up her phone.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.510
So I throw on my shoes,
throw on my, my shirt

45:58.560 --> 46:01.420
and I run out, run out to the store.

46:01.470 --> 46:03.580
And there's like this alley

46:04.879 --> 46:08.740
right by the store and, and it's dark.

46:08.790 --> 46:10.683
And I, I think I see something.

46:12.570 --> 46:17.050
And I'm pretty sure I'm
seeing what I'm seeing,

46:17.100 --> 46:19.960
but I'm also not sure if
that's what I'm seeing,

46:20.010 --> 46:21.558
like if I'm seeing it correctly, you know?

46:21.600 --> 46:22.433
So I, I,

46:24.090 --> 46:27.910
I move a little bit closer
to this like figure and

46:31.230 --> 46:33.820
it, it's clear

46:35.190 --> 46:37.810
that there's my wife

46:41.820 --> 46:46.683
getting her blood sucked
out by two vampires.

46:52.090 --> 46:54.190
So, so I, I, I,

46:54.240 --> 46:57.910
I run over there and I
throw one of them off of her

46:57.960 --> 46:59.440
and he's in like that trance

46:59.490 --> 47:02.163
and he doesn't even notice that I'm there.

47:03.270 --> 47:05.650
And I throw the other one off

47:05.700 --> 47:08.950
and I stomp his fucking
face into the ground

47:09.000 --> 47:11.650
and pick up my wife.

47:11.700 --> 47:13.653
I run to the store to call 9-1-1.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.360
It was too late.

47:22.410 --> 47:23.243
She was gone.

47:24.870 --> 47:26.043
- [Ash] Oh shit, Sammy.

47:31.590 --> 47:32.703
- Ever since that day,

47:34.110 --> 47:36.393
I made it my life's goal.

47:37.620 --> 47:39.543
Rid the world of vampires.

47:41.430 --> 47:42.963
- [Ash] Or at least Ybor City.

47:44.220 --> 47:45.053
- Yeah,

47:47.490 --> 47:49.053
Ybor City is where I start.

47:50.400 --> 47:54.753
- [Ash] I'm so sorry that
happened to you and your wife.

47:56.010 --> 47:58.113
I'm sure she was a real special lady.

48:00.540 --> 48:01.373
- The best.

48:02.443 --> 48:03.813
I miss her so much.

48:06.061 --> 48:07.061
- It's okay.

48:19.991 --> 48:21.581
I'm, I'm sorry.

48:21.631 --> 48:22.414
I'm sorry.

48:22.464 --> 48:25.840
- No, I find it therapeutic
to talk about it.

48:25.890 --> 48:27.543
It's, it's, it's totally fine.

48:28.470 --> 48:31.300
- Well, if you ever
need to spill your guts,

48:31.350 --> 48:32.553
I'm here for you.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.383
Real talk.

48:34.433 --> 48:36.580
- Thank you, Ash.

48:36.630 --> 48:40.953
Seriously, you're a good person. Really.

48:42.090 --> 48:43.780
- I try to be, you know?

48:43.830 --> 48:44.673
- Yeah, me too.

48:45.810 --> 48:47.973
People are fucking dicks half the time.

48:49.050 --> 48:49.883
- Yeah.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.730
- Let's get some sleep.
- Yeah, yeah.

48:54.780 --> 48:55.980
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

49:33.804 --> 49:38.804
(window banging)
(suspenseful music)

50:03.136 --> 50:06.969
(suspenseful music continues)

50:27.024 --> 50:30.037
(door closing)

50:30.087 --> 50:33.920
(suspenseful music continues)

51:00.114 --> 51:03.947
(suspenseful music continues)

51:31.463 --> 51:35.463
(suspenseful music intensifies)

51:51.266 --> 51:53.933
(Sammy gasping)

51:56.595 --> 51:57.512
- You okay?

51:58.470 --> 52:00.303
I have someone for you to meet.

52:02.570 --> 52:05.570
(suspenseful music)

52:08.321 --> 52:09.878
- No!

52:09.928 --> 52:10.930
(Sammy gasping)

52:10.980 --> 52:12.003
Holy shit.

52:23.619 --> 52:25.420
(Sammy gasping)

52:25.470 --> 52:26.303
Fuck.

52:29.670 --> 52:32.493
- Morning, sleepyhead. Bad dream?

52:33.570 --> 52:34.840
- Yes.

52:34.890 --> 52:37.210
What are you, what are you,
like a voyeur or something?

52:37.260 --> 52:38.320
What are you doing?

52:38.370 --> 52:39.880
- No, I'm not a voyeur.

52:39.930 --> 52:41.973
I heard you stirring so I came in.

52:43.590 --> 52:45.070
- Yeah.

52:45.120 --> 52:49.240
- So I was thinking, we don't
have any appointments today,

52:49.290 --> 52:51.340
so why don't we just work from here

52:51.390 --> 52:53.380
instead of going into the office?

52:53.430 --> 52:56.350
We really need to make a plan for Sophia.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.000
- Yeah, we can do that.

52:58.050 --> 53:01.533
What about my morning coffee
from my favorite coffee joint?

53:04.350 --> 53:05.183
What?

53:06.480 --> 53:07.313
How?

53:09.510 --> 53:11.388
- I got up at 8:30 so I
went out for a little bit

53:11.430 --> 53:12.330
and let you sleep.

53:13.470 --> 53:15.940
- You're, you're a good person,

53:15.990 --> 53:18.400
no, you're a great person.

53:18.450 --> 53:19.283
Thanks, Ash.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.370
- I know.

53:21.420 --> 53:22.490
Come on, get your butt up.

53:22.540 --> 53:24.873
- [Sammy] Okay, okay, damn.

53:30.300 --> 53:32.680
- Sophia, Denton is here to see you.

53:32.730 --> 53:34.383
- Oh, great. Send him in.

53:38.280 --> 53:41.080
Oh, Denton, so nice to see you again.

53:41.130 --> 53:41.963
- Likewise.

53:50.040 --> 53:52.000
We happy?
- Oh, we happy.

53:52.050 --> 53:53.073
Thank you, Denton.

54:03.148 --> 54:05.470
(glass clinking)

54:05.520 --> 54:09.130
- Alana, your breakfast is getting cold.

54:09.180 --> 54:10.013
- Sorry, ma'am.

54:20.910 --> 54:22.870
- Do you like it here, Alana?

54:22.920 --> 54:24.100
- It's okay.

54:24.150 --> 54:26.320
I like our old house better.

54:26.370 --> 54:28.330
- Well, this is our house for now.

54:28.380 --> 54:30.713
We're probably gonna move
in a few months again.

54:31.620 --> 54:32.453
- Okay.

54:37.020 --> 54:38.860
- Do you like your AB negative?

54:38.910 --> 54:41.140
- Yeah, it's really good.

54:41.190 --> 54:44.200
- All right, so hurry up and
get ready so we can go, okay?

54:44.250 --> 54:45.083
- Yes, ma'am.

54:55.650 --> 54:58.840
- All right, tonight
we stake out the club,

54:58.890 --> 55:01.713
we follow Sophia home, survey the land,

55:02.970 --> 55:05.883
see if we can get to her or
not and how we can do it.

55:06.891 --> 55:10.870
- Okay, we should probably
also get there around midnight

55:10.920 --> 55:12.790
since the club closes at 2:00.

55:12.840 --> 55:14.590
We don't wanna miss her coming out.

55:18.120 --> 55:22.135
And we should take my car
because yours is a shit box.

55:22.185 --> 55:24.183
- Hey, I love my car.

55:27.150 --> 55:27.983
- Okay.

55:31.950 --> 55:35.170
- On second thought, maybe
we should take yours.

55:35.220 --> 55:36.870
- That's what I thought.
- Yeah.

55:47.970 --> 55:48.803
- Ma'am?

55:50.130 --> 55:52.083
- Yes, Roman. What can I do for you?

55:53.970 --> 55:57.490
- We've heard that Sammy Slick
is going to follow you home

55:57.540 --> 56:00.190
and that he's going to try
to infiltrate the grounds.

56:02.160 --> 56:04.990
- You know, I thought he was kind of cute,

56:05.040 --> 56:07.593
but he's starting to get
on my fucking nerves.

56:12.300 --> 56:13.133
Roman?

56:14.880 --> 56:15.713
- Ma'am?

56:16.860 --> 56:19.110
- I'm gonna need you to
get ahold of Antonio.

56:20.340 --> 56:23.433
- Oh, you're bringing Tony Shock and Awe?

56:24.360 --> 56:27.430
- Yes, I am. And he can
name his fucking price.

56:27.480 --> 56:28.503
I don't give a shit.

56:29.340 --> 56:32.403
I want Slick dead and his
little bullshit sidekick too.

56:34.980 --> 56:36.670
- I'll get on it, ma'am.

56:36.720 --> 56:39.273
Is there anything else you need from me?

56:40.500 --> 56:41.583
- No, just go.

56:51.395 --> 56:52.523

♪ Who are you, who are you ♪

- Hello, Tony.

57:26.190 --> 57:28.195
Thank you for coming
on such a short notice.

57:28.245 --> 57:30.145
- Well, anything for you, Miss Sophia.

57:31.230 --> 57:32.560
What can I do for you?

57:32.610 --> 57:34.443
- Are you familiar with Sammy Slick?

57:35.520 --> 57:37.060
- Yeah, I heard of the dude.

57:37.110 --> 57:39.850
- Well, he's become
quite of nuisance lately.

57:39.900 --> 57:41.470
We have a good thing going on in here

57:41.520 --> 57:43.293
and he's starting to fuck it up.

57:45.090 --> 57:45.923
- Say no more.

57:46.920 --> 57:48.610
I got you.
- Perfect.

57:48.660 --> 57:51.550
Also, he has a little bitch sidekick.

57:51.600 --> 57:52.863
She needs to go also.

57:53.820 --> 57:54.653
- Huh.

57:55.650 --> 57:56.483
I'm on it.

57:57.810 --> 58:01.090
Miss Sophia, it's always
a pleasure to see you.

58:01.140 --> 58:03.593
I'll let you know when the
project's complete, okay?

58:04.489 --> 58:05.406
Ta-ta.

58:05.456 --> 58:07.873
(rock music)

58:10.440 --> 58:11.273
- All right.

58:12.300 --> 58:13.510
You go get the car.

58:13.560 --> 58:15.370
I'll grab some coffee for us

58:15.420 --> 58:17.553
so we can, you know, stake out her place.

58:20.490 --> 58:23.503
Hang on one second.
(door closing)

58:32.730 --> 58:33.563
For luck.

58:34.530 --> 58:35.883
- Be careful.
- You too.

58:40.306 --> 58:42.889
(door closing)

58:44.929 --> 58:45.914
(Tony laughing)

58:45.964 --> 58:46.785
- [Tony] What's up, bitch?

58:46.827 --> 58:49.000
- Shit. They called you in?

58:49.050 --> 58:51.850
- That's right, you old
cheesecake looking motherfucker.

58:51.900 --> 58:53.494
Now get your paddy ass up. Let's fight.

58:53.544 --> 58:54.377
- Damn.

58:58.475 --> 59:00.892
(rock music)

59:08.405 --> 59:10.988
(men grunting)

59:31.301 --> 59:32.301
- More, huh?

59:33.334 --> 59:34.417
What is this?

59:35.548 --> 59:37.057
I got the both of yous, huh?

59:37.107 --> 59:38.985
Fuck you. Fuck you!

59:39.035 --> 59:41.452
(rock music)

59:46.113 --> 59:48.696
(men grunting)

59:50.160 --> 59:50.993
Come on.

59:52.548 --> 59:54.052
(Tony yelling)

59:54.102 --> 59:56.519
(rock music)

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.640
- Oh my God. Who was that guy?

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:07.523
- Antonio.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.708
They call him Tony Shock and Awe.

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:12.100
- Holy fuck.
- He's a VI assassin.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.080
- Holy fuck. I've heard of that guy.

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:15.180
How are you not dead?

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:17.800
- I have no idea.

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:20.100
He had the opportunity
and he just pushed me.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.860
- Why didn't your stake kill him?

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:28.413
- He's not full vampire,
so he bleeds like a human.

01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:31.750
- How is that even possible?

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.700
- Some scientists crossed him in a lab

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:35.980
with vampire and human genes.

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:39.045
So he feeds like a vampire,
bleeds like a human.

01:00:39.095 --> 01:00:41.391
- Great, great.

01:00:41.441 --> 01:00:42.274
Okay.

01:00:44.111 --> 01:00:46.450
- I think I, I think
I got him pretty good.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.503
We should be able to
do what we need to do.

01:00:50.185 --> 01:00:51.018
- All right.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:53.663
Let's go.
- Okay.

01:01:07.028 --> 01:01:10.510
(car doors closing)

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.773
- Okay, top five favorite movies.

01:01:13.823 --> 01:01:15.933
- I gotta pick five? Geez.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.097
Um, "Star Wars",

01:01:21.187 --> 01:01:22.990
"The Dark Knight".

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.460
- Damn, Heath Ledger is so good.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:25.343
- Yeah.

01:01:27.277 --> 01:01:29.080
- "No Country For Old Men".

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:32.140
You know, like with that like air gun,

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:34.637
it was so scary.
- I know, right?

01:01:34.687 --> 01:01:36.483
- "The Departed". How many is that?

but it doesn't look like
anything we can't handle.
