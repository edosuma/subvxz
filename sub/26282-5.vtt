WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.085 --> 00:20.388
-Previously on The Resident...
-BELL: Oh, my God. It's Bradley.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.256
I love you, too.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.024
And I do think
it'll be different this time.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.427
JULIAN: I hear you have
a wedding coming up.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.496
-You studying up
to do a Bollywood dance?
-I have two left feet.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.498
JULIAN: Well, maybe I can help.
I was a dancer.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.033
Dr. Benedict at Atlanta General
told me all about you.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.568
Said you were
the best student he ever had.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.706
Head of the hottest new medical
device company in the country.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.374
Also the most eligible bachelor.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.676
We all know you're
the most eligible bachelor.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.578
JULIAN: Dr. Bell is meeting
my boss, Gordon Page.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.614
I've done some reading
on your vagus nerve stimulator.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.349
-More.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.717
It exceeded
all our expectations.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.252
We're gonna help so many people.

00:51.285 --> 00:54.054
If you can't land Gordon,
I will.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.394
GORDON:
Rare high-altitude potatoes.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.029
-Glacier water.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.632
Quadruple-filtrated through...

01:04.665 --> 01:06.300
uncut diamonds.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.771
Cheers.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.473
BELL:
Cheers.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.411
Best one yet.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.612
Well, have I convinced you?

01:18.646 --> 01:19.880
No, you didn't need to.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.948
I did my homework.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.650
Your new VNS device
is top-rated.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.585
All the QuoVadis products
are solid.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.420
Why'd I buy all this vodka?

01:26.454 --> 01:28.956
Because you want more. You
want exclusivity in my hospital.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.560
Smart man.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.896
So, what do you need

01:35.929 --> 01:39.600
to make all QuoVadis devices
Chastain's standard of care?

01:39.633 --> 01:42.603
It's not what I need.
It's what Chastain needs.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.505
Something to impact
our bottom line.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.174
A discount. Deep discount.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.608
40%.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.277
Whew.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.911
I never give more than ten.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.613
And that's a hell
of a profit margin.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.348
-Before you mark up
the patients.
-30.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.151
20. Final offer.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.253
And that's only because
you can hold your liquor.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.754
Chastain can get that number

02:00.788 --> 02:02.856
from any of the established
device manufacturers.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.792
Why should I go with you,
aside from the vodka?

02:04.825 --> 02:07.361
Because, as QuoVadis's
newest opinion leader,

02:07.395 --> 02:10.364
you can speak at conferences,
like the one in Cabo next week.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.200
You fly on the company jet.

02:12.233 --> 02:15.035
Five-star hotel.
Gourmet meals.

02:15.068 --> 02:18.206
Abundant downtime to hit the
beach with a margarita in hand.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.874
Of course, there's a small
speaking fee and stipend.

02:20.908 --> 02:24.712
It's not much,
but we can offer you 200.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.480
Thousand.

02:30.251 --> 02:33.554
Uh...

02:41.662 --> 02:45.499
That and a 25% discount,
and you have a deal.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.457
*

03:19.700 --> 03:22.336
-JULIAN: Voilà.
-IRVING: Mmm, doughnuts.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.071
-I'm starving.
-Have one.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.274
IRVING:
You're the best.

03:26.307 --> 03:29.109
-Mmm. Mm-hmm.

03:29.142 --> 03:32.079
Morning. Fresh from the oven.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.614
-IRVING: Very kind of you.
-Mm-hmm.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.016
-Someone else's oven.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.419
QuoVadis is just
the delivery system.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.953
No, thanks.

03:39.987 --> 03:40.954
IRVING:
He doesn't do carbs.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.623
I don't do bribes.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.558
I heard
you're helpful in the OR,

03:44.592 --> 03:46.794
but I'm not a fan of sales reps
inside the hospital.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.362
Seems like a conflict
of interest.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.230
-No offense.
-None taken.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.232
You know what,
I'll take another one.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.968
We don't make enough
to turn down free food.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.036
I should've gone into finance.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.638
IRVING:
And quit medicine?

03:57.671 --> 04:00.140
Speaking of which, Bradley's
coming in for a heart valve.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.942
Headlines: used to be one of us,
took a nosedive

04:01.975 --> 04:03.811
through a skylight,
left the halls of healing.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.212
Be nice.
He's still one of us.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.281
Oh, no, he's not.
Now he's a Muggle.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.816
IRVING: Hundreds of thousands
in med school debt,

04:08.849 --> 04:10.050
-down the drain.
-DEVON: Yeah, and he'll be

04:10.083 --> 04:11.285
paying it off for decades.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.557
Pravesh, they need you in VIP.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.426
They don't page you
when they need me.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.593
Looks like they do.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.096
Hey, uh, do you remember
the Barnetts?

04:23.130 --> 04:25.399
First-year intern,
pediatric rotation.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.067
Two adopted kids
with medical needs, right?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.969
Yes, and, apparently,
you made quite the impression.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.604
The oldest boy hurt his wrist.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.973
He's asking for the cool doctor
with the tattoos.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.776
-Ha!
-Our peds resident
isn't here yet,

04:35.809 --> 04:37.345
-so...
-I'm on it.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.512
Don't do that.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.947
In this new Mario game,

04:39.980 --> 04:41.815
-I just like...
-Hey, Jasper!

04:41.849 --> 04:44.151
-Henry.
-Hi.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.320
Look at you, all grown up.
You driving yet?

04:46.354 --> 04:48.188
ZOEY:
Good to see you, Dr. Hawkins.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.590
If that's still your name?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.191
Yeah, I was an intern.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.426
I was trying out some nicknames.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.761
ZOEY:
Yeah, it wasn't good.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.295
Right, Hammer?

04:55.329 --> 04:56.530
Hammer?

04:56.564 --> 04:58.165
ZOEY:
Anyway, here we are again.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.368
Who knew our stairs
could be so dangerous?

05:00.401 --> 05:01.802
NIC: Can you give me
a little wiggle?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.105
Elbow pit, dude.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.342
Did he get his flu shot?

05:08.376 --> 05:10.478
For sure.
But every kindergartner

05:10.511 --> 05:13.381
has a cold right now.
The school is a phlegm factory.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.982
We have been seeing
so many kids.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.817
JASPER:
Is Henry's hand broken?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.519
Can he still pitch
his game today?

05:18.552 --> 05:20.488
Maybe not today,
but sometime soon.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.824
Are you a righty or a southpaw?

05:36.737 --> 05:39.172
NIC:
Absence seizures.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.741
He's had them since infancy?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.242
ZOEY: Yeah,
but they've always been mild.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.844
And we have them under control.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.513
Is that why you fell, Henry?

05:45.546 --> 05:48.015
It wasn't a seizure.
I just tripped.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.650
I was reading to Jasper
when we heard the crash.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.318
CONRAD:
Okay, he probably

05:51.351 --> 05:52.753
just needs a med adjustment.
It happens as kids grow.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.354
We'll call for a neuro workup.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.223
Keep icing his wrist.
Get an X-ray, too.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.926
-Mm-hmm.
-Cool.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.161
:
All right. Come here.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.897
All right. All right.

06:03.931 --> 06:04.998
HENRY:
Wash your hands.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.068
He never takes that off. Ever.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.202
'Cause it's awesome.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.871
ZOEY:
He loves this hat.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.573
It inspired his police
birthday party this Saturday.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.380
I'm gonna try to move his
pediatrician visit up to today.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.683
No, no reason
for an extra doctor's visit.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.784
We'll check him out here.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.586
We'll be back.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.054
-Hey. It's okay.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.457
NIC: You're worried
about the little brother.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.625
Yeah, Jasper had it rough
when he was fighting leukemia.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.060
Chemo, radiation.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.462
He had pneumonia twice.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.697
Poor kid has been
in the hospital all the time.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.198
How long has he been
in remission?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.468
His last bone marrow transplant
went well.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.135
Been clear for two years.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.871
Now he's got a low-grade fever
and a cough.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.807
Saw a yellow bruise on him,
and his nodes are swollen.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.878
-Dr. Richards. Retired in June.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.680
Buzzkirk took her patients.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.149
I know.
I don't like him either.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.628
Hi, I'm Dr. Pravesh.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.464
Conrad can't even answer
his own pages now?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.635
-VIP. That's me!

07:14.668 --> 07:16.470
-Never better, man.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.305
You know, besides needing
a whole new heart valve.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.107
But who cares, right?
I'm back here.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.075
I get to see all my pals from
before leaving the rat race.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.977
The rat race. Is that
what we're calling it now?

07:24.011 --> 07:25.979
Well, in medical marketing,
we do, for sure.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.415
Yeah, I got really lucky
with a major firm.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.651
Signing bonus took care
of all my med school debt.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.487
-You're kidding.
-Nope.

07:33.521 --> 07:37.090
Boom. Debt-free
and pulling in mid-six figs.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.793
Seriously, man.
But it's not just that, dude.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.795
-I've never been happier,
honestly.
-That's great.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.764
-You found something you love.
-I did.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.366
So, how are wedding plans going?

07:46.399 --> 07:48.301
Good. Never better.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.470
Uh-oh. I know that look.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.439
That's the look you used to get
when Conrad would pimp you.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.474
-You look really stressed, man.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.476
Just normal wedding stress.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.111
Dumb stuff that Priya and I
have to decide.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.780
And we're not always
on the same page.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.849
Uh-huh. Is everything okay
with you two?

08:04.151 --> 08:06.687
It's crazy. You know,
this wedding just feels like

08:06.720 --> 08:08.455
this endless pile
of to-do lists.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.157
-Mm-hmm.
-Plus, I'm always here.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.392
Mm. And here is not exactly
a walk in the park.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.161
-Right.
-Look, I remember how it is.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.896
-Definitely no signing bonuses.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.031
Right? Just sleep deprivation.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.167
Hey, man.
What else is goin' on, man?

08:26.607 --> 08:28.576
You were supposed
to be here an hour ago.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.712
Rounds start at 6:00 a.m.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.814
I had patients before you.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.149
How many of them have a tumor
the size of a persimmon

08:36.183 --> 08:38.719
-I looked at your scans.

08:38.752 --> 08:42.055
Your tumor has shrunk
to the size of an apricot.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.724
Never cared for apricots.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.525
It's good news.
It means we can schedule

08:45.559 --> 08:48.161
the surgery to remove the tumor
for tomorrow morning.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.396
Any questions?

08:49.429 --> 08:50.764
You gonna shave my head?

08:50.798 --> 08:53.100
It's spine surgery.
Why would we do that?

08:53.133 --> 08:54.602
Roger down the block
had his appendix out.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.436
Came home with a Mohawk.

08:56.469 --> 08:59.439
I'm confident that had nothing
to do with his operation.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.908
What do you know about Roger?

09:00.941 --> 09:03.276
Or hair?
You barely have hair.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.614
Where's Dr. Voss?

09:06.647 --> 09:08.548
More suction,

09:08.582 --> 09:10.517
-right here.
-There's so much blood.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.920
I said suction.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.221
*

09:14.254 --> 09:17.124
* You got to let me go *

09:17.157 --> 09:18.592
Uh, should we page Vascular?

09:18.626 --> 09:20.427
No. When you reduced
the clavicle,

09:20.460 --> 09:22.763
a clot got dislodged, and
now it's bleeding like stink.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.031
-These are

09:24.064 --> 09:25.565
ortho problems.
We are ortho surgeons,

09:25.599 --> 09:28.769
so we fix them.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.303
* Ready for war,
I got my armor gear *

09:30.337 --> 09:32.039
* Carry your sword
'cause the time is near *

09:32.072 --> 09:33.907
* What a thrill,
always seems to amaze me *

09:33.941 --> 09:35.408
* In the forest with the youth
and they're raving *

09:35.442 --> 09:36.910
* Dancing nonstop
till the break of dawn *

09:36.944 --> 09:38.411
* Sheriffs come around,
probably best to run *

09:38.445 --> 09:40.380
* Fire in my eyes,
can't catch me now. *

09:40.413 --> 09:43.984
Shall I page Pre-Op
to bring the pat...

09:46.119 --> 09:47.655
* Don't judge me,
you only live once *

09:47.688 --> 09:49.122
* Homies in the back,
so we got to live it up *

09:49.156 --> 09:50.791
* Party in the lake,
everybody get in now *

09:50.824 --> 09:52.626
* Get in now, get in now,
get in now, get in now *

09:52.660 --> 09:54.227
KIT:
Ah. There.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.462
The source of the bleed.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.497
-BEN: Huh.
-Here. Put pressure here.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.633
-Okay.
-No, here.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.669
-BEN: Oh.
-Bulldog clamp, six-oh Prolene.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.270
* Run wild *

10:03.303 --> 10:05.238
* I'm on a mission *

10:05.272 --> 10:07.641
There.

10:07.675 --> 10:10.477
Easy to control the bleed
once you recognize the source.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.479
That...

10:12.512 --> 10:14.481
was so cool.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.850
Agreed. Mayo.

10:16.884 --> 10:20.620
* Running miles and running and
I'm loving all the bruises *

10:20.654 --> 10:22.255
* Running miles
and running wild *

10:22.289 --> 10:24.157
* I'm chugging
like I'm fueling *

10:24.191 --> 10:26.359
* Houston, tell 'em
that I'm coming up *

10:26.393 --> 10:28.195
* Let me go. *

10:28.228 --> 10:31.031
What the hell is that?

10:33.366 --> 10:37.104
This is not my valve.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.807
Who put this valve here?

10:41.508 --> 10:43.643
Cancel the surgery.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.316
TILLY:
I'm booking your
spa day in Cabo.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.619
Question: did you want
the couples massage or...?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.021
You're not going alone, are you?

10:54.054 --> 10:56.656
Ooh, couples massage.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.991
Sounds delightful.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.492
But perhaps it can wait.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.660
A word, Dr. Bell?

11:00.694 --> 11:03.697
Of course. Tilly, hold my calls.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.301
I'm speaking
at a conference in Cabo.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.204
I'd love a top woman orthopod
to introduce me.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.707
Let's talk about a screw,
shall we?

11:14.708 --> 11:16.710
A screw?

11:16.744 --> 11:19.579
Does this look
like a 6.5 millimeter,

11:19.612 --> 11:20.748
nine-grooved
cancellous bone screw to you?

11:20.781 --> 11:22.482
Well, it shouldn't,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.918
because it's 6.3 millimeters
with eight grooves.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.486
-Care to explain

11:26.519 --> 11:29.156
why it showed up in the middle
of my clavicle surgery?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.758
They accomplish the same thing.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.060
The AorMed valve
is a thing of glory.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.361
Sleek leaflets.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.163
Perfectly aligned suture ring.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.098
-She drives like a dream.
-KIT: Let me guess.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.699
Changes in your OR?

11:39.733 --> 11:42.870
An intruder.
An alien heart valve.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.739
-It's a top-of-the-line...
-That's not the point.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.575
You don't get to make
surprise, unilateral decisions

11:48.608 --> 11:49.910
that affect our patients.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.045
No ceremony. No discussion.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.947
-KIT: No notice, even.
-You two can't agree
on anything.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.615
Suddenly you're on
the same team?

12:06.093 --> 12:08.728
A bomb just exploded in my body.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.311
Jasper Barnett's labs.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.150
White blood count over 150,000.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.252
Low platelets,
blasts everywhere.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.821
-Liver's starting to go, too.
-NIC: Henry came in

12:33.854 --> 12:35.155
with a broken wrist,
but we thought Jasper

12:35.188 --> 12:36.890
-was in remission.
-And now he's not.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.225
He already has a rare phenotype.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.793
It's known to be resistant.

12:39.827 --> 12:42.462
And when a kid comes back
like this...

12:42.495 --> 12:43.897
I'll give him a month.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.765
Maybe two, tops.
Only reasonable thing now

12:45.799 --> 12:47.600
is palliative treatment.
Anything else

12:47.634 --> 12:49.169
at this point
would do more harm than good.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.505
Let's hope Mom sees it that way.
They hardly ever do.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.341
What if it had been caught
earlier?

12:54.374 --> 12:55.775
Wouldn't have mattered.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.410
His initial treatment
was aggressive and thorough,

12:57.444 --> 12:59.012
and it was his best chance
at a cure.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.248
They kept the cancer at bay
as long as possible.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.516
Now it's back with a vengeance.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.352
Guess I'll go spill the beans.

13:05.385 --> 13:08.321
-Best to get it over with.
-Let me handle it.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.623
They know me.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.192
-I had them
on my intern rotation.
-Hey,

13:12.225 --> 13:14.327
if you want to take the worst
part of the job, it's all yours.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.666
How does someone like that guy
end up in pediatrics?

13:19.699 --> 13:23.136
The same way HODAD
ended up in the OR.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.842
You okay?

13:30.844 --> 13:34.147
How do you tell a mother
her child is dying?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.124
Found it.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.625
Let's see.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.195
So, look, this is way before
I broke my pelvis.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.497
I told you I started early.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.699
You're incredible.
Do you miss dancing?

13:52.732 --> 13:55.168
No. I got my hip replacement,
got my life back,

13:55.202 --> 13:56.403
and now when I sell devices,

13:56.436 --> 13:58.071
I help other people
do the same thing.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.639
I love it.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.009
So, I showed you mine.
You show me yours.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.543
What?

14:03.576 --> 14:05.845
-The health monitor app
you're working on.
-Oh. Uh...

14:05.879 --> 14:07.847
we're still making some tweaks
in the program.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.050
If we could monitor
elderly patients from afar

14:10.083 --> 14:11.384
with more accuracy...

14:11.418 --> 14:13.386
You could see
their overall medical report

14:13.420 --> 14:15.588
instead of relying
on day-of examination results.

14:15.622 --> 14:16.990
Exactly.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.491
And it's working,
but now we have to install

14:18.525 --> 14:20.894
the device and pair it
with something wearable.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.362
Wearables are huge
in the aging market.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.031
So show me it.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.234
All right.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.770
Diagnosis:

14:30.803 --> 14:33.240
a previously unbeknownst cyst
beneath the ulna.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.375
It ruptured with such power,
such force

14:35.408 --> 14:36.843
that it fractured
the strong bone.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.879
You found that on the Internet.
A bomb in your body.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.549
Oh, there was an explosion.
I created it.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.784
It was undeniably godlike.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.419
Right.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.521
Let's get you in a splint,
shall we?

14:48.555 --> 14:50.090
I'll order X-rays

14:50.123 --> 14:52.692
to confirm you can be treated
nonoperatively.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.263
So, my diagnosis
was correct, huh?

14:56.296 --> 14:57.897
Your Web surfing was correct.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.632
Let's talk

14:59.666 --> 15:01.401
about our mutual problem,
shall we?

15:01.434 --> 15:03.770
The craven king
in the high tower.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.072
There are half a dozen
other devices

15:05.105 --> 15:06.639
Bell is swapping out
for QuoVadis,

15:06.673 --> 15:09.409
including one I need
for a spinal resection tomorrow.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.445
That's where that man
makes my ego look nonexistent.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.382
Not possible. But it's useless
to try and overrule him.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.883
At least for doctors.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.418
Say more.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.953
Well, if patients were unhappy

15:19.987 --> 15:21.989
with administration
making medical decisions,

15:22.022 --> 15:24.457
-Bell might listen.
-He'd have to.

15:24.491 --> 15:27.227
The power of persuasion.
I like it.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.299
Oh, I'm damn near a master.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.140
CHILD:
I'm gonna get you so much!

15:56.123 --> 15:59.993
Did you get
Jasper's results back?

16:00.027 --> 16:02.762
We'll go over everything
in the conference room.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.498
You want to wait
for your husband to get here?

16:05.532 --> 16:08.368
Uh, not happening.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.138
It got tough. He bailed.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.040
His loss. Let's do this.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.190
I knew it.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.828
Inside, I knew it.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.232
If I had gotten Jasper
in here earlier...

16:39.266 --> 16:40.833
We'd still be right here.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.470
This isn't your fault at all.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.804
You need to hear that.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.307
There has to be something.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.676
I will find him
another bone marrow donor.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.811
Even if we found one right away,
he's not healthy enough

16:51.844 --> 16:53.213
to go through the prep regimen.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.914
Then when
can he start chemo again?

16:54.947 --> 16:57.650
-We just have to get
even more aggressive.
-Zoey...

16:57.684 --> 17:00.953
Jasper can't be cured.

17:06.959 --> 17:10.563
And if we tried anyway,

17:10.597 --> 17:13.766
the treatments are painful.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.369
I will connect you
with an oncologist

17:16.403 --> 17:20.173
so you can discuss it, but...

17:20.207 --> 17:22.775
he would suffer.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.617
I read about alternative
treatments in Mexico.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.385
-We can go.
-Zoey...

17:32.419 --> 17:34.254
No.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.556
I will do
whatever you want to do.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.525
This is your decision.

17:38.558 --> 17:42.061
But my job
is to tell you the truth,

17:42.095 --> 17:45.465
which is Jasper can't beat this.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.137
You can't stop that.
You can't change that.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.904
None of us can.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.974
But what you can do...

17:55.007 --> 17:58.010
is you can focus on the quality
of life he has left.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.448
You can be with him every step.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.919
And you can be there for Henry.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.256
He's gonna need you.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.798
I knew you couldn't resist

18:18.831 --> 18:20.600
putting your hands
on my heart again.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.469
That is a stretch.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.938
Actually, Dr. Okafor misses
standing shoulder to shoulder

18:25.972 --> 18:28.007
with a surgical giant
on the reg.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.977
Little housekeeping matter.
Sign this.

18:31.010 --> 18:34.681
It's a form saying that
you insist on the AorMed valve.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.584
The website said QuoVadis is the
new protocol here at Chastain.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.453
Which is why I need you
to insist on using the valve

18:40.487 --> 18:43.356
that your brilliant surgeon
believes is best.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.991
You want me to use those devices

18:45.024 --> 18:47.126
to kick administration
in the cojones?

18:47.160 --> 18:49.962
-Mm, maybe not quite that.
-But aren't they new
for a reason?

18:49.996 --> 18:52.765
-Well, it should work that way.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.667
But the FDA approves new devices

18:54.701 --> 18:56.469
that have literally
never been tested

18:56.503 --> 18:58.671
inside a human.
Not only do we not know

18:58.705 --> 19:01.140
if they're better,
we don't know if they're safe.

19:01.174 --> 19:03.376
Okay, and what exactly
do you like about the AorMed?

19:03.410 --> 19:05.111
AUSTIN: Do you really want
to have a conversation

19:05.144 --> 19:06.813
on the finer points
of a heart valve?

19:06.846 --> 19:08.648
MINA: Bradley used to be
a surgical resident.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.882
At this hospital.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.819
Great. I guess that's better
than a trip...

19:12.852 --> 19:14.554
Triple-board-certified master
of the scalpel?

19:14.587 --> 19:15.722
Okay, well, I still work

19:15.755 --> 19:17.690
in the medical field,
so I definitely have

19:17.724 --> 19:20.159
-an understanding of what...
-AUSTIN: Nobody cares
about your understanding!

19:20.193 --> 19:22.895
I am the surgeon.
You are the patient.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.897
I am the one
who knows what's best,

19:24.931 --> 19:27.534
and you are the one who takes
a medically induced nap

19:27.567 --> 19:29.969
in an OR with your life
in the hands of people

19:30.002 --> 19:33.706
who are far more experienced,
more educated and more awake.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.175
-I don't believe it.
-KIT: Unfortunately, it's true.

19:36.209 --> 19:39.178
Medical devices are
far less regulated than pharma.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.348
Thousands are recalled
every year

19:41.381 --> 19:43.483
for harming the patients
they were supposed to help.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.184
Which is why I prefer
older devices

19:45.218 --> 19:47.186
that have
a proven safety record.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.488
The hospital
wouldn't put something inside me

19:48.521 --> 19:50.056
that would hurt me.

19:50.089 --> 19:54.160
Doctors want the devices
that work best for patients.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.263
Our administration chooses

19:56.296 --> 19:57.697
the device manufacturer

19:57.730 --> 19:59.999
that gives them
the greatest profit margin.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.336
Now, I caution you not
to let them decide for you.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.672
But ultimately it's your choice,

20:05.705 --> 20:08.275
and I will support
whatever you decide.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.577
Sign the damn thing.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.487
What was that?

20:22.489 --> 20:25.692
That was his charm offensive.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.329
I think maybe you're trying
to tell your boss to buzz off.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.800
But I support it.
You make the call.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.603
Oh, I am so loving
my career change in this moment.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.871
Poor you. I can't believe
you have to work with that guy.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.373
Listen to me.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.775
Good surgeons
are often arrogant jerks.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.812
But Dr. Austin has the most
skilled hands I have ever seen.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.614
You want happy chitchat
and fake empathy,

20:47.647 --> 20:49.416
or you want your heart fixed
without complications?

20:49.449 --> 20:51.318
I want the best surgeon
using the latest innovation.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.819
Well, you can't have both
at Chastain.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.587
Our surgeons want proof

20:54.621 --> 20:57.990
that whatever the latest
innovation is, it works.

20:58.024 --> 21:01.127
Got your page.
How can I help you?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.895
Austin's X-rays.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.798
It's a non-displaced fracture
through a benign cyst.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.468
-He's cleared for surgery.
-Oh, good. He's one of our best.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.269
Although he's no Kit Voss.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.339
Thank you, Dr. Bell.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.140
Randolph.

21:14.173 --> 21:18.945
One of my patients is requesting
I implant a VertGuard device

21:18.978 --> 21:22.415
instead of the QuoVadis one
for her spinal tumor resection.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.984
I'm gonna need my device back
in this hospital

21:25.017 --> 21:26.419
by tomorrow morning.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.655
I made that decision
as a CEO and a surgeon.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.290
QuoVadis is a trusted brand
with proven outcomes.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.692
If you want me to talk
to your patient myself...

21:32.725 --> 21:33.993
Over my dead body.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.330
You've got some tension
in your neck.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.131
I can see it from here,
Randolph.

21:39.165 --> 21:42.168
I am not trying
to cause you stress. Truly.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.945
Wow.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.681
Well, that-that was...

21:54.714 --> 21:56.483
that was effective.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.551
How about a peace offering?

21:58.585 --> 22:00.720
Your office in an hour?

22:01.721 --> 22:03.823
That should be interesting.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.025
Clear your schedule.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.540
Hey, buddy.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.975
Can I hang for a minute?

22:23.009 --> 22:26.813
If you're looking for Mom,
she's in with Jasper.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.348
Nope, just checking on you.

22:29.382 --> 22:32.652
Do you know what I want to be
when I grow up?

22:32.685 --> 22:34.220
A baseball player?

22:34.253 --> 22:36.355
Not anymore.

22:36.389 --> 22:39.358
Now I want to be a scientist
or doctor or something.

22:39.392 --> 22:42.395
Find a cure for cancer
that could save Jasper.

22:48.034 --> 22:51.270
You are a great brother.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.406
Do you know that?

22:57.444 --> 23:00.212
Is that for Jasper?

23:00.246 --> 23:02.749
His birthday's this weekend.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.452
He loves police stuff so much.

23:05.485 --> 23:08.120
We were gonna have a party
where he dressed up like a cop.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.423
That's all he's
been talking about.

23:10.457 --> 23:13.726
It sucks, 'cause now
we have to be here.

23:17.830 --> 23:21.133
I think we might be able
to do something about that.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.869
Really?

23:22.902 --> 23:24.904
I think I can pull that off...

23:24.937 --> 23:27.239
with a little help.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.542
Think you can help me?

23:29.576 --> 23:31.644
Mmm, yeah.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.946
Perfect.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.949
Okay, unfortunately, Make-A-Wish
couldn't do anything official

23:36.983 --> 23:38.585
for a couple of weeks.

23:38.618 --> 23:42.421
But they did give me--
you ready for this?--

23:42.455 --> 23:44.757
these guys.

23:44.791 --> 23:45.992
-CONRAD: Oh...

23:46.025 --> 23:47.159
HENRY:
Not the hat.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.461
Jasper has his own.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.396
Good call. Okay,
you ready for this, though?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.264
Ta-da!

23:52.298 --> 23:53.733
-CONRAD: Oh-ho!
-NIC: A police car!

23:53.766 --> 23:55.735
Awesome, right?

23:55.768 --> 23:57.336
IRVING:
No, seriously, junior year,

23:57.369 --> 23:59.438
-Decatur Community Playhouse.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.140
I understudied.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.676
We found everything on the list.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.978
Band-Aids, ketchup, hair spray.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.914
Oh, and these.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.148
So...

24:10.817 --> 24:13.285
You just found real handcuffs?

24:14.487 --> 24:15.855
Yeah.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.490
Hmm.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.463
You know your part, right?

24:24.497 --> 24:26.633
You bet I know my part.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.234
It's almost showtime.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.945
Uh, Dr. Voss says
I should send you straight in.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.280
Uh... excellent.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.016
Uh, no disturbances
for the next hour.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.586
Let's make that two.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.563
Who are you?

24:56.596 --> 24:58.631
I'm Ken.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.167
What kind of pressure
do you prefer, Doctor?

25:01.200 --> 25:03.202
Uh...

25:12.612 --> 25:14.380
-Oh!
-JASPER: Oh! I got 18.

25:14.413 --> 25:16.583
-You won.
-I won by one point.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.718
You did.

25:22.922 --> 25:25.725
I work undercover on the force.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.064
The police station called.
There's a criminal on the loose.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.702
ZOEY:
Oh, no. A criminal?

25:35.735 --> 25:38.838
His name is The Germ.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.574
Things could get tough.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.011
I need a partner.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.613
Here.

25:46.646 --> 25:49.548
I was gonna give this to you
for your birthday.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.752
I can help you.

25:52.785 --> 25:55.187
Yeah? Okay.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.424
I got your squad car.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.427
CONRAD:
All right, let's solve a crime!

26:01.460 --> 26:04.563
-CONRAD: I don't know,

26:04.597 --> 26:07.299
but security caught
The Germ on camera

26:07.333 --> 26:09.035
-sneakin' around.
-Uh-oh.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.737
How do we find him?

26:10.770 --> 26:13.372
The Germ has made a move!

26:13.405 --> 26:16.609
CONRAD:
Detective Okafor!

26:16.643 --> 26:18.377
Talk to us.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.947
He's stolen all of the bandages,

26:20.980 --> 26:23.549
-except... one.
: Oh...

26:23.582 --> 26:26.986
CONRAD:
There's a red fingerprint on it.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.588
You think it's blood?

26:29.622 --> 26:30.857
That's ketchup.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.495
Hmm.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.230
Good catch, eagle eye.

26:38.264 --> 26:42.268
Where would The Germ
have gotten into ketchup?

26:42.301 --> 26:44.103
Oh, the cafeteria!

26:44.136 --> 26:45.604
-All right.

26:45.638 --> 26:46.973
Looks like we're going there.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.741
Ready?

26:48.775 --> 26:50.810
-Let's do this!

26:50.843 --> 26:52.244
ZOEY:
Come on, let's go.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.612
Let's go.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.158
CONRAD:
You see any clues?

27:06.192 --> 27:08.260
Mm-mmm.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.662
I see a handprint.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.135
Hey, mister,
we're looking for The Germ.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.436
It's Bob, okay?

27:17.469 --> 27:19.138
I haven't seen him,
but if you want food,

27:19.171 --> 27:21.007
you're out of luck, okay,
because someone,

27:21.040 --> 27:23.042
they stole
all the sterile gloves.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.443
I see one!

27:24.476 --> 27:25.812
Jasper, look.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.179
Another one, and another one.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.015
We have to follow them!

27:29.048 --> 27:31.918
-NIC: Move it, guys! Go!
-Let's go!

27:35.221 --> 27:37.724
I think we're getting close.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.425
Keep your eyes peeled, guys.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.567
-The Germ!
-He's really here!

27:48.600 --> 27:51.904
Stop bothering me!
I'm a super bug.

27:51.938 --> 27:54.540
-We got to use what's here.

27:54.573 --> 27:56.008
You can't fight me.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.243
Like, maybe this?

28:02.248 --> 28:06.018
If you push these buttons
right here, you will stop him

28:06.052 --> 28:07.820
with an electric shock.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.388
You got this.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.496
Stop it right now, Germ!

28:17.529 --> 28:19.565
CONRAD:
Okay, Germ,

28:19.598 --> 28:21.768
Are you gonna give back
those bandages and gloves?

28:21.801 --> 28:23.035
Never!

28:23.069 --> 28:26.005
I'm MRSA the super bug.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.276
CONRAD:
Okay...

28:30.309 --> 28:32.078
stop him.

28:32.111 --> 28:36.048
You, you little shrimp,
I'll crush you.

28:36.082 --> 28:38.751
Bring it.
What are those?

28:38.785 --> 28:41.754
What are those things?
Get away from me with those.

28:41.788 --> 28:44.690
I'm trapped!

28:44.723 --> 28:46.959
-Don't come any closer!
-JASPER: Yeah, you are!

28:54.633 --> 28:57.036
Ow! Ow! Ow. Ow.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.307
You're arrested!

29:03.675 --> 29:05.812
-JESSICA: Get up, kiddo.
-Don't make me go back!

29:05.845 --> 29:07.914
It's so dark in there.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.281
JESSICA:
We got him now.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.083
Get him out of here!

29:11.117 --> 29:13.185
-*

29:24.763 --> 29:26.765
*

29:33.539 --> 29:35.674
Is this damn hospital
gonna kill me?

29:35.707 --> 29:37.476
Penny, tell me what's happening.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.979
I don't know!
I woke up, the bed was wet.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.313
I couldn't get up.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.982
Incontinence, lack of sensation.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.584
-No.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.920
-Nothing below my waist.

29:47.954 --> 29:50.322
Am I paralyzed?

29:50.356 --> 29:52.324
My guess is
cauda equina syndrome.

29:52.358 --> 29:55.494
The tumor must be compressing
the nerves of your spinal cord.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.496
-Oh, my God, oh, my God.
-Penny, Penny,

29:57.529 --> 30:01.000
your surgery just
moved up to now, okay?

30:01.033 --> 30:02.468
-Book an OR.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.270
If we don't get her in there
right away,

30:04.303 --> 30:06.705
she's never gonna walk again.

30:06.738 --> 30:09.675
All right, fast and focused.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.810
Pull the mayo closer.
Ten-blade, full retractor set.

30:11.844 --> 30:14.646
-On the way, Dr. Voss.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.683
Damn it.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.785
That's the QuoVadis device.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.820
It's the only one
they had left in supplies.

30:21.854 --> 30:24.290
-Do you want me to call out
for something else?
-There's no time for that.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.225
Looks like I have to put
a device into her spine

30:26.258 --> 30:29.095
that I already convinced her
not to use.

30:38.737 --> 30:40.339
Dr. Austin.
I don't know if you remember,

30:40.372 --> 30:41.908
but we've met before.

30:41.941 --> 30:44.143
You're a horseman
of the apocalypse. I know.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.245
I wanted to speak with you
about one of your patients.

30:46.278 --> 30:47.914
-I don't do device reps. Sorry.
-Well, this device rep is

30:47.947 --> 30:50.849
trying to tell you that Bradley
Jenkins wants a new surgeon.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.185
Who does he want?

30:53.219 --> 30:54.586
Archibald Simon.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.422
I'm better than Archie.
Significantly so.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.857
That's what everyone says,
but Bradley has his heart set

30:58.891 --> 31:00.726
on QuoVadis,
and you won't use it.

31:00.759 --> 31:03.495
I've installed over 600 valves
from 12 different companies.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.397
I've tried what's out there,
and every single time

31:05.431 --> 31:08.067
-I go back to the AorMed.
-Do what you want.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.401
I know QuoVadis devices
are gold.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.203
I'm just trying
to do you a solid.

31:12.238 --> 31:14.040
Right. Sure you are.

31:14.073 --> 31:17.743
Look, this doesn't affect me
one way or the other.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.912
Either Dr. Simon puts in
the QuoVadis device here,

31:19.946 --> 31:21.413
or Bradley says he'll transfer

31:21.447 --> 31:24.383
to Abe Benedict
at Atlanta General.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.585
-Mm-hmm.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.188
I was his star resident.
He raised me on the AorMed.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.190
Well, now he uses QuoVadis,

31:31.223 --> 31:33.425
and he's willing
to poach your patients.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.810
-Austin.
-Good evening, sir.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.079
What's that?

31:53.112 --> 31:54.813
A mere flesh wound.

31:54.846 --> 31:57.316
-I'll survive.

31:57.349 --> 31:58.985
ABE: Well, good to see you,
as always.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.220
-Well, it's 7:30,

32:01.253 --> 32:03.222
constitutional jog
at the alma mater,

32:03.255 --> 32:04.423
rain or shine.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.093
I know.
I'm a creature of habit.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.761
Which is why I was surprised
to hear that you've moved away

32:09.795 --> 32:12.064
from the heart device
you've used for years.

32:12.098 --> 32:13.465
Why the QuoVadis valve?

32:13.499 --> 32:17.936
Uh, well, the truth is,
valves are very similar.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.405
Then why the switch?

32:19.438 --> 32:21.440
-The penicillin coating.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.742
I thought that was
much ado about nothing.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.744
-You've found
it really makes a difference?
-Reduced the rate

32:25.777 --> 32:28.347
of postoperative endocarditis
by half.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.450
-AJ, you know better than anyone

32:31.483 --> 32:33.252
it'd have
to take a great product

32:33.285 --> 32:36.388
to get me to change my ways.

32:37.990 --> 32:41.193
All right, well,
dinner next month,

32:41.227 --> 32:43.129
-Wouldn't miss it.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.031
-AUSTIN: All right.
-Good to see ya.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.135
They're bringing in a cot
for you.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.703
Thank you...
both, for everything.

32:51.737 --> 32:53.939
You kidding me? It was fun.
Who knew Jasper was

32:53.972 --> 32:55.707
such a good little detective?

32:58.677 --> 33:00.812
I caught The Germ, Henry.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.814
You were awesome.

33:02.848 --> 33:05.051
Okay, Freddie Freeman, bedtime.

33:05.084 --> 33:08.654
All right, good night, guys.

33:08.687 --> 33:11.657
Good night, Officer Jasper.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.826
I'm not gonna grow up
to be a police officer.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.328
What do you want to be now?

33:16.362 --> 33:18.697
I'm not gonna grow up.

33:18.730 --> 33:21.333
I saw my mom crying.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.369
I know what that means.

33:24.536 --> 33:27.239
Can you do something for me?

33:27.273 --> 33:29.508
Name it.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.377
JASPER:
Take care of my brother.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.079
He fell down the stairs.

33:33.112 --> 33:36.648
It was maybe
one of those things he gets.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.184
An absence seizure?

33:39.418 --> 33:41.553
Can you fix him?

33:41.587 --> 33:43.655
I can try.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.757
My mom needs him.

33:45.791 --> 33:48.260
Promise.

33:50.062 --> 33:52.098
Yes.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.133
Promise.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.891
* Ta-da! *

34:19.925 --> 34:21.593
-Yes.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.429
Ooh.

34:23.462 --> 34:25.631
You and Conrad were great today.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.466
If you ever decide
to leave medicine,

34:27.499 --> 34:29.034
you have a backup career.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.036
As police officers?

34:31.069 --> 34:33.739
I don't think
we really play by the rules.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.074
No, I was thinking
as children theatre actors.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.452
How are you doing?

34:48.320 --> 34:50.422
Heartbroken.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.624
That family...

35:00.299 --> 35:03.635
ZOEY :
Jasper. It's okay.

35:07.139 --> 35:09.841
-Oh, talk to me.
-Unresponsive, bradycardiac.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.411
-Cheyne-Stokes breathing.
-You have do something.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.987
-Pupils are fixed and dilated.
-Epi and atropine's maxed out.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.523
Intracerebral hemorrhage.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.858
-He's herniating.
-I know.

35:31.730 --> 35:35.033
What are...
What's happening? Save him!

35:35.066 --> 35:36.368
Zoey...

35:36.402 --> 35:37.369
Listen to me.

35:37.403 --> 35:38.637
Jasper has a brain bleed.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.038
Okay, so stop it.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.640
-We can't.

35:41.673 --> 35:44.109
No one can. His blood is...

35:44.142 --> 35:45.611
His blood-- it can't clot.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.779
-No. No.
-This is the end.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.848
No.

35:52.184 --> 35:55.654
I don't want his last moments to
be torture, and neither do you.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.857
He needs you, both of you.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.660
I'm here, Jasper.
I'm right here.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.162
Zoey, do not miss this moment.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.168
Tell him you're here.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.970
ZOEY:
Yeah.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.639
Tell him you love him.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.385
:
Just tell him it's okay.

36:26.418 --> 36:27.986
-Tell him it's okay.
-It's okay.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.021
Tell him it's okay.

36:33.459 --> 36:35.727
ZOEY:
Baby.

36:35.761 --> 36:38.597
It's Mommy and Henry.

36:46.938 --> 36:51.109
We love you... so much.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.567
*

37:18.003 --> 37:20.005

37:53.972 --> 37:55.574
Left arm--

37:55.607 --> 37:59.345
retract the myocardium
while I finish snipping.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.684
There.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.619
-Ready for valve placement.
-Pickups.

38:09.455 --> 38:11.490
JULIAN: When you grab the valve,
it helps to...

38:11.523 --> 38:13.759
Saleswoman, I've been
grabbing valves since...

38:13.792 --> 38:15.461
Well, I was gonna say

38:15.494 --> 38:17.429
since before you went
to med school, but you didn't

38:17.463 --> 38:19.331
go to med school.
You went to business school.

38:19.365 --> 38:22.501
Wharton

38:23.969 --> 38:25.937
This damn valve is too big.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.640
No, I think
you're holding it upside down,

38:28.674 --> 38:31.843
which is, I believe, what Julian
was trying to tell you.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.681
Speak up, then.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.516
Put the valve on the mayo stand.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.553
You see that white tick mark?

38:41.587 --> 38:43.689
Clamp it there
when you pick it up.

38:43.722 --> 38:47.393
Now it's positioned
for proper placement.

38:52.197 --> 38:54.065
Easy-peasy.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.333
MINA:
Oh.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.569
A perfect fit.

38:59.505 --> 39:02.340
Start suturing, Dr. Okafor,
please.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.210
Six-oh Prolene to me.

39:05.243 --> 39:07.713
For the record, I went
to dance conservatory.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.347
-Juilliard.
-AUSTIN: Oh.

39:09.381 --> 39:13.084
An artist. That's why
you're good in the OR.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.654
KIT:
Boo-hoo.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.157
How was that massage?

39:19.190 --> 39:21.359
Helped with the neck tension,
but for the record,

39:21.393 --> 39:23.361
I prefer a female
massage therapist.

39:23.395 --> 39:26.097
It's not so fun
to expect one thing

39:26.131 --> 39:27.899
and be surprised
by another, is it?

39:27.933 --> 39:30.502
The QuoVadis devices are good
for the hospital

39:30.536 --> 39:32.170
because they're good
for the patients.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.172
Your case yesterday
had a perfect outcome.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.709
-Yes, but that's not the point.

39:37.743 --> 39:39.611
You're a gifted surgeon.
In your OR, did you want

39:39.645 --> 39:42.013
an agenda shoved down your
throat from an ivory tower?

39:42.047 --> 39:43.949
Kit, just see the big picture,
They're innovators.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.617
There's opportunity here
for you, as well.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.586
-QuoVadis can...
-Let me be clear.

39:47.619 --> 39:51.122
Perks, bonuses,
trips to Cabo as payola-- no.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.858
I'll never be a shill
for a device company,

39:52.891 --> 39:54.426
even a reputable one.

39:54.460 --> 39:57.929
It's not in the best interest
of my patients. And Randolph,

39:57.963 --> 39:59.598
I have a high enough opinion
of you

39:59.631 --> 40:01.399
to believe
you wouldn't do it, either.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.272
I've gone over
the surgical report.

40:07.305 --> 40:08.940
The heart valve
was installed perfectly.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.809
Blood flow
and oxygen levels are good.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.445
-You have a new lease on life.
-And no more excuses.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.246
You are officially included
in the Bollywood dance

40:15.280 --> 40:16.915
-at my wedding.
-BRADLEY: No. You do not

40:16.948 --> 40:18.884
want that. I have three
left feet. I'm serious.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.318
Listen, if Julian can make me

40:20.351 --> 40:22.053
look coordinated,
she can teach anyone.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.790
Devon is an exceptional student,

40:24.823 --> 40:26.492
and we have a final rehearsal
coming up.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.993
I can catch you up in no time.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.661
Mina,

40:29.695 --> 40:32.330
-Uh, just try and stop me.

40:32.363 --> 40:35.433
Now, I have
to remove the surgical drain

40:35.467 --> 40:36.835
and the patient needs to rest.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.937
-Okay, take care.
-Thank you.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.572
-Mm.
-Sorry.

40:40.606 --> 40:41.973
-Sorry.
-See you later, man.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.943
Thanks for everything.

40:46.478 --> 40:49.447
So... those two?

40:49.481 --> 40:52.484
-He's engaged.
-And she is gorgeous.

40:52.518 --> 40:54.686
So is Devon's fiancée, Priya.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.690
Mina, has having a boyfriend
turned you into a romantic?

40:58.724 --> 41:00.492
I have always been a romantic.

41:00.526 --> 41:03.261
And I've romantically learned
to mind my own business.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.463
Okay. So you trust Julian?

41:05.497 --> 41:07.465
Not at all.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.867
I trust Devon.
