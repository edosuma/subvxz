00:25.320 --> 00:28.920
<i>Matilda Stone
first experienced heartbreak</i>

00:28.920 --> 00:31.120
<i>at the tender age
of three years,</i>

00:31.120 --> 00:34.960
<i>three days, three hours,
and three minutes old...</i>

00:37.000 --> 00:40.520
<i>...when her mother
mysteriously disappeared.</i>

00:44.560 --> 00:46.960
<i>But her youth would
also bear witness</i>

00:46.960 --> 00:50.440
<i>to the heartbreak
of her mother's three sisters.</i>

00:52.640 --> 00:55.520
<i>Her Aunt Cat Stone
suffered prolonged heartbreak</i>

00:55.520 --> 00:58.240
<i>due to the untimely death
of fellow band member</i>

00:58.240 --> 01:00.680
<i>and soulmate, Nikki Holler.</i>

01:04.840 --> 01:08.240
<i>Her Aunt Jane Stone
suffered instant heartbreak</i>

01:08.240 --> 01:11.240
<i>when she was jilted
on her wedding day.</i>

01:19.440 --> 01:21.040
<i>And her Aunt Beth Stone</i>

01:21.040 --> 01:23.240
<i>suffered the inevitable heartbreak</i>

01:23.240 --> 01:26.640
<i>of losing her husband
to a long-term illness.</i>

01:36.720 --> 01:39.960
<i>For most, the notion of having
a heart of stone</i>

01:39.960 --> 01:43.520
<i>means a person with a cold
or unfeeling nature.</i>

01:45.680 --> 01:47.280
<i>But for Matilda,</i>

01:47.280 --> 01:49.920
<i>to have a heart of stone
means to be someone</i>

01:49.920 --> 01:53.760
<i>who, despite their own heart
being broken,</i>

01:53.760 --> 01:57.160
<i>is still capable
of immense love.</i>

03:16.400 --> 03:19.520
<i>It had been three months,
two weeks,</i>

03:19.520 --> 03:23.800
<i>12 days, and 13 hours
since that fateful night</i>

03:23.800 --> 03:28.080
<i>when Matilda Stone had missed
the opportunity of a blind date</i>

03:28.080 --> 03:32.440
<i>with local GP Dr. Daniel Lynch.</i>

03:32.440 --> 03:35.080
<i>Since that time, Matilda
has committed herself</i>

03:35.080 --> 03:38.800
<i>to her policing career
with little thought of romance,</i>

03:38.800 --> 03:41.960
<i>whereas Daniel has taken
the notions of commitment</i>

03:41.960 --> 03:46.000
<i>and romance
to a whole new level.</i>

03:46.000 --> 03:48.960
Engagement? No!

03:50.160 --> 03:51.400
Morning, Aunt Jane.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.960
Morning, Matilda.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.560
Have you seen the paper?

03:54.560 --> 03:56.400
- I haven't seen anything.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.200
What about the paper?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.840
Well, um...
Well, the price has gone up.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.240
I-It's a disgrace.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.960
I agree.
It's totally unacceptable.

04:03.960 --> 04:05.880
I think I might write
to our MP.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.120
Mm.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.240
You're all acting weird.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.840
Why are you here anyway?
I thought you were staying

04:12.840 --> 04:14.760
at the Wellness Retreat
for that article you're writing.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.960
We're on our way there now.

04:16.960 --> 04:20.520
Uh, we were just wondering
if we couldn't persuade Jane

04:20.520 --> 04:21.920
to join us.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.440
Yeah, come on, sis --
a bit of pampering,

04:24.440 --> 04:26.720
bit of spa action,
you know you want to.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.040
Strange people touching me?
I don't think so.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.840
You two go. Have fun.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.480
Bye.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.720
Bye.

04:51.680 --> 04:56.240
<i>Now celebrating its 20th year,
the Wildemarsh Wellness Retreat</i>

04:56.240 --> 04:58.720
<i>has long prospered
through its motto,</i>

04:58.720 --> 05:01.680
<i>"Refecti, Requiem, Reparando."</i>

05:01.680 --> 05:03.440
Looking good!

05:03.440 --> 05:06.280
<i>"Rest, Recuperate,
Reinvigorate."</i>

05:06.280 --> 05:10.400
Okay, we'll end it there.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.520
<i>Although certain employees' ideas</i>

05:12.520 --> 05:16.120
<i>about how to reinvigorate
its female clientele...</i>

05:16.120 --> 05:18.280
- Let me help you.
- Oh, thank you.

05:18.280 --> 05:21.040
<i>...are somewhat open
to interpretation.</i>

05:21.040 --> 05:22.920
Stephen Swift.

05:22.920 --> 05:27.320
Physiotherapist and
chief fitness instructor.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.760
Beth Stone.
And this is my sister Cat.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.160
Ms. Stone, is it?

05:33.160 --> 05:34.640
Sorry, what's your name again?

05:34.640 --> 05:37.160
Stephen,
but you can call me Steve.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.760
Well, I hate to break this
to you, Steve,

05:39.760 --> 05:42.920
but that tree you're barking up,
it's the wrong one.

05:42.920 --> 05:47.520
Stephen, take our guests' bags
to the Dolphin Room.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.720
- But I was just --
- Straightaway, please.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.520
I'll see you ladies later.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.880
Not if we see you first.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.720
Rowena Walker, general manager
and head of public relations.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.760
And you must be --
don't tell me --

06:03.760 --> 06:06.240
uh, Cat, former
Volcanic Youth guitarist

06:06.240 --> 06:08.520
and award-winning
graphic novelist,

06:08.520 --> 06:10.880
meaning you must be Beth,
best-selling author

06:10.880 --> 06:14.040
and intrepid guest columnist
at the <i>Wildemarsh Watchman.</i>

06:14.040 --> 06:15.880
You've done your homework.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.840
If you'd like to follow me,

06:17.840 --> 06:21.000
I've prepared a small tour
of the facilities.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.720
Feel free to ask questions.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.880
I want your article to be
an honest reflection

06:24.880 --> 06:26.160
of your stay with us.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.640
Not worried I'll write
something bad?

06:27.640 --> 06:29.840
Ah, when you've been in P.R.
as long as I have,

06:29.840 --> 06:33.040
you learn that all publicity
is good publicity.

06:33.040 --> 06:37.240
<i>But General Manager and Head of
Public Relations Rowena Walker</i>

06:37.240 --> 06:39.280
<i>was soon to discover the phrase</i>

06:39.280 --> 06:41.880
<i>"all publicity
is good publicity"</i>

06:41.880 --> 06:45.840
<i>wasn't necessarily true.</i>

06:45.840 --> 06:48.960
<i>Especially when it comes to murder.</i>

06:51.640 --> 06:54.800
Morning.
Morning.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.520
Morning, sir.

06:56.520 --> 07:00.080
Sergeant Stone,
have you seen today's paper?

07:00.080 --> 07:02.080
I know, sir --
the price has gone up again.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.520
My aunts are most upset.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.280
Yes. Precisely. Shocking.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.360
Was there anything else?

07:09.360 --> 07:13.400
Yes, uh, another break-in
at Rachel's Papers.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.040
Uh...

07:27.040 --> 07:29.680
- Well, go on then, Stone.
Mm.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.040
- And no hanging about.
- Mm-hmm.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.640
Or reading the paper.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.080
Sir.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.520
So, as well as detox
and weight loss programs,

07:43.520 --> 07:46.320
we also offer many
complimentary treatments

07:46.320 --> 07:48.680
like, uh,
cognitive behavioral therapy.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.280
And how did the retreat
come about?

07:50.280 --> 07:53.160
Well, Dr. Isherwood founded
the retreat 20 years ago

07:53.160 --> 07:56.080
after a successful career
in intensive care.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.040
She wanted it to be a place
of calm where people can escape

07:59.040 --> 08:01.600
from the outside world.
And off the record,

08:01.600 --> 08:04.000
I think this place is as much
a retreat for Dr. Isherwood

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
as it is for our guests.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.480
I heard she won the money to buy
this place in a poker game.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.320
Oh, that's an unproven rumor.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.080
And what about you?
How long have you been here?

08:13.080 --> 08:14.720
From the very start.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.360
I was Dr. Isherwood's
first employee.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.840
Ah, Winnie.
The leak's in there.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.880
Lord Overshaw's moving
to the Albatross Suite.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.000
But I don't want to move.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.120
Can't be helped, I'm afraid,
Lord Overshaw.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.720
The leak behind the bath panel

08:30.720 --> 08:32.880
means the entire bathroom
needs redecorating.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.520
But I'm happy where I am.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.760
Dr. Isherwood, can I introduce
you to our guests

08:36.760 --> 08:38.600
from the <i>Wildemarsh Watchman?</i>

08:38.600 --> 08:41.120
Yes, of course. Just one moment.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.720
Let's discuss this matter

08:42.720 --> 08:46.920
once you've settled into your
new room, Lord Overshaw.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.880
Dr. Isherwood.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.760
Pleased to meet you, uh...

08:51.760 --> 08:54.040
Beth Stone and her sister Cat.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.200
Apologies, Rowena did tell me,

08:56.200 --> 08:58.040
but I have a memory
like a sieve.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.640
Oh, I'm the same.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.280
Anything new gets lost
in the shuffle.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.680
- Yes, precisely.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.800
Ooh!

09:07.800 --> 09:10.000
Oh, Alistair,
what have you done now?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.520
I'm trying to fix the leak.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.560
Well, not very effectively,
by the looks of things.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.000
I'm sorry, Angela.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.600
I'm sure Alistair will
have it fixed in no time.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.120
You'll have to excuse me,

09:22.120 --> 09:24.160
I just have to have a quick
word with my brother.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.360
Come along.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.520
Could we possibly
not print that?

09:30.720 --> 09:32.360
Thanks.

09:35.720 --> 09:40.960
And this is where
you'll be staying.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.520
Rowena, have you seen
my pass card?

09:45.520 --> 09:46.720
No, no one's handed it in.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.200
I swear I had it on me earlier.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.400
Sorry, uh, Grace Mulberry,
lead therapist.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.840
I specialize in acupuncture
if you have any aches or pains.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.280
Dr. Isherwood's holding
a small presentation

09:58.280 --> 10:00.080
about the retreat
for you at 6:00.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.320
Alcohol-free, obviously.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.800
I've asked key staff to attend
so you've plenty of time

10:05.800 --> 10:08.240
to ask any questions
you need for your article

10:08.240 --> 10:11.760
before the 10 o'clock curfew.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.720
Curfew?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.320
What curfew?

10:15.320 --> 10:16.760
Dr. Isherwood's a great believer

10:16.760 --> 10:19.560
in the regenerative
powers of sleep.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.840
She insists we're all tucked up
in bed by 10:00.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.520
- Oh.
- Come along, Grace.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.000
I'll help you look
for that pass card.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.840
Oh, anything you need, anything
at all, just let me know.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.200
Nice meeting you.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.040
Hm.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.440
10 o'clock curfew?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.240
Alcohol-free?

10:42.240 --> 10:43.920
Did I not mention it?

10:46.480 --> 10:49.280
It's the second time this month.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.920
No money taken this time either?

10:50.920 --> 10:53.320
Nope, just random bits of stock.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.320
I figure it's kids
mucking about.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.720
You might want to think about
installing a security camera.

10:58.720 --> 11:02.320
Oh, dear, another break-in?

11:02.320 --> 11:03.920
Kids these days.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.160
Papers, Ms. Bryant?

11:05.160 --> 11:08.400
Thank you, Rachel.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.000
See you tomorrow.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.880
Bryant?

11:18.880 --> 11:20.680
Was her husband in the police?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.440
Well, he might have been.
I'm not sure.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.480
- Oh, excuse me.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.920
DR.<i>The
Rise and Shine Aqua Fit Workout</i>

11:48.920 --> 11:52.320
<i>will commence
in seven minutes' time.</i>

11:52.320 --> 11:54.320
What color would you say
the pool was?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.240
Azure?

11:56.240 --> 11:58.840
Oh, cheer up. We're on holiday.

11:58.840 --> 12:02.520
What, a salad-only menu, no
booze, and lights out at 10?

12:02.520 --> 12:04.560
I'm not sure this counts
as a holiday.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.640
Hi, ladies.
Can I offer you a --

12:12.640 --> 12:14.160
Taylor, love?

12:14.160 --> 12:16.560
Today's acupuncture
still hasn't eased my neck.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.680
Be a star and book me in
for another session.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.000
Yes, Ms. Hayes, right away.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.400
Thanks, babe. Appreciate you.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.600
- Uh --
- <i>The Aqua Aerobic Class</i>

12:24.600 --> 12:29.000
<i>is your opportunity
to nurture your water element.</i>

12:29.000 --> 12:30.760
Brat!

12:36.120 --> 12:39.040
<i>The one thing
Jane Stone disliked more</i>

12:39.040 --> 12:40.840
<i>than casual fly posting...</i>

12:40.840 --> 12:42.440
You, off my window!

12:42.440 --> 12:45.640
<i>...was the casual use
of the English language.</i>

12:45.640 --> 12:47.320
"Irrigardless"?

12:47.320 --> 12:50.760
If you're going to fly-post,
at least learn how to spell!

12:53.720 --> 12:55.120
What, just chocolates?

12:55.120 --> 12:58.320
127 bars, according
to the shop owner.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.040
Sir, have you seen the paper
about Dr. Lynch's engage--

13:02.040 --> 13:05.040
Sarge!
I didn't know you were back.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.320
What was that about Dr. Lynch?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.960
Nothing.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.120
"Mr. and Mrs. Timothy
Young of the Grange, Wildemarsh,

13:15.120 --> 13:18.240
are proud to announce the formal
engagement of their daughter,

13:18.240 --> 13:21.960
Ms. Natasha Tatiana Young,
to Dr. Daniel Lynch."

13:24.720 --> 13:26.720
Maybe we should get them a card.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.160
Good idea.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.080
Why don't you organize that,
Foster?

13:36.080 --> 13:37.520
Sir.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.360
<i>And finally,</i>

<i>The Wildemarsh
Wellness Retreat.</i>

14:14.960 --> 14:18.960
<i>Requiem, Reparando, Refecti.</i>

14:29.120 --> 14:31.920
If I could have
everyone's attention.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.720
As you all know, this year
we are celebrating

14:35.720 --> 14:38.480
the retreat's 20th anniversary.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.960
With this in mind, now seems
like an appropriate time for me

14:44.960 --> 14:47.720
to start planning my succession.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.960
I have decided to take a step
back from my duties

14:51.960 --> 14:53.760
as retreat director.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.520
I'll still be living on-site,
of course,

14:55.520 --> 14:57.760
and I'll always be around
as a sounding board

14:57.760 --> 15:00.880
should anyone need me,
but it means that the day-to-day

15:00.880 --> 15:05.920
running of the place will be
in the hands of someone new.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.600
Since we're all
gathered together,

15:09.600 --> 15:11.960
I'd like to take
this opportunity

15:11.960 --> 15:15.400
to announce my successor.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.200
They are someone very special,

15:18.200 --> 15:20.440
a loyal employee,

15:20.440 --> 15:23.440
a real member of the family.

15:23.440 --> 15:28.720
I am delighted to announce
that the next director

15:28.720 --> 15:33.760
of the Wildemarsh
Wellness Retreat will be...

15:33.760 --> 15:37.400
our very own lead therapist,
Grace Mulberry.

15:40.960 --> 15:44.120
I'm sure you will all join me

15:44.120 --> 15:48.440
in wishing Grace the very best
of good luck in her new role.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.040
She made me promise
not to say anything.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.600
- Hm!
- I need a proper drink.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.880
Oh, someone's not happy.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.440
He's not alone.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.160
<i>While Rowena Walker's
self-help books informed her</i>

16:06.160 --> 16:10.200
<i>that other people's successes
weren't her failure,</i>

16:10.200 --> 16:15.760
<i>she couldn't help but feel an
acute sense of disappointment.</i>

16:15.760 --> 16:17.760
<i>A sentiment similarly shared</i>

16:17.760 --> 16:21.960
<i>by a certain
detective sergeant.</i>

16:21.960 --> 16:25.840
Oh, Matilda, I didn't know
you were home.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.440
How was your day?

16:28.440 --> 16:29.480
Hm?

16:30.520 --> 16:33.320
Oh, sorry. Um, quiet.

16:33.320 --> 16:36.440
Chocolate theft
at Rachel's Papers.

16:36.440 --> 16:40.360
That reminds me, do you remember
if Inspector Bryant's wife

16:40.360 --> 16:42.760
was called Edith?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.240
Who?

16:44.240 --> 16:47.080
The officer in charge
of Mum's disappearance.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.440
I can't say that I remember.
I tell you what --

16:52.440 --> 16:55.120
why don't I make
your favorite, tuna pasta bake?

16:55.120 --> 16:58.160
Oh, sorry, I've not got much
of an appetite tonight.

17:05.680 --> 17:09.520
You remember that day you were
12 and I didn't get married?

17:09.520 --> 17:11.280
Of course.

17:11.280 --> 17:18.280
Well, looking back, I think what
happened then was for the best.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.600
What I'm trying to say,
not very elegantly,

17:20.600 --> 17:23.280
is that sometimes,

17:23.280 --> 17:27.080
and quite a lot of the time,
actually,

17:27.080 --> 17:29.720
things have a way
of working out.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.480
Thanks, Aunt Jane.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.080
<i>As the clock struck 10,</i>

17:45.080 --> 17:47.640
<i>everyone at the Wildemarsh
Wellness Retreat</i>

17:52.440 --> 17:57.240

DR.<i>

17:59.080 --> 18:00.760

19:06.120 --> 19:08.720
Hello?!

19:08.720 --> 19:11.600
Hello? Help me!
I can't get out!

19:11.600 --> 19:15.000
Help! I can't get out!

19:15.000 --> 19:20.400
Help!
Please help me!

19:20.400 --> 19:23.360
Help me!

19:29.160 --> 19:31.560
Help me.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.480
Help me, please.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.320
This is a bit naughty, isn't it?

19:49.320 --> 19:51.040
Naughty's good for you.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.920
Come on, spa's this way.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.320
What about the curfew?

19:54.320 --> 19:55.920
I haven't been to bed
before 10 o'clock

19:55.920 --> 19:58.080
since I was at junior school.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.080
Besides...

20:00.080 --> 20:01.800
Where'd you get that?

20:01.800 --> 20:03.440
Best you don't ask.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.680
Ah, we'll have to drink it
out the bottle.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.440
What's that?

20:20.440 --> 20:21.840
Oh, God!

20:21.840 --> 20:23.560
Ah!

20:44.680 --> 20:46.920
Yes, I'll tell her now.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.840
The head of the Wellness Retreat
has been steamed alive.

21:00.280 --> 21:03.320
Dr. Isherwood
liked have the spa to herself.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.120
She'd wait until
the 10 o'clock curfew

21:05.120 --> 21:07.120
and spend half an hour
in the steam room.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.720
You could set your clock by it.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.480
And this was general knowledge?

21:10.480 --> 21:13.520
By staff
and regular guests, yes.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.840
I'm sorry, um...

21:16.840 --> 21:19.480
Dr. Isherwood was like
a fairy godmother to me.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.560
Melanie?

21:24.560 --> 21:26.360
Natasha, what are you
doing here?

21:26.360 --> 21:27.960
Oh, Mummy's treating me.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.320
I have a pound and a half
to lose

21:29.320 --> 21:30.920
before the engagement party.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.920
Oh, Mummy, this is Melanie,

21:32.920 --> 21:34.520
one of Daniel's little
work colleagues.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.760
Matilda.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.480
Natasha.

21:38.480 --> 21:41.320
Daniel, darling!

21:41.320 --> 21:44.360
Dr. Lynch.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.960
Congratulations on your engagement.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.360
Natasha thought it was time
we settled down.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.880
Have you set a date?

21:50.880 --> 21:53.160
Not yet, but we don't intend
leaving it too long.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.560
Do we, darling, hmm?

21:55.560 --> 21:57.040
- Shall we?
- Please.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.080
It was nice to meet you,
Melanie.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.880
Have you heard?
Terrible.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.080
Did you see anything unusual
going on last night?

22:08.080 --> 22:09.880
Me? No.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.480
I was in bed by 8:00.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.880
What took you so long?

22:17.880 --> 22:19.960
I've been doing some
very interesting research

22:19.960 --> 22:21.600
into steam generators.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.520
Oh, sounds riveting.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.080
What's she doing?

22:30.080 --> 22:33.240
I can't see
'round the corner.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.080
- Excuse me, wha--
- Oh!

22:38.800 --> 22:42.360
Matilda, can I apologize?

22:42.360 --> 22:43.960
What are your aunts
doing here, Stone?

22:43.960 --> 22:45.560
They found the body, sir.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.120
Your aunts should
carry a health warning.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.920
"May seriously harm you
or others around you."

22:50.920 --> 22:52.400
Victim?

22:52.400 --> 22:54.600
Dr. Angela Isherwood.
55, single.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.000
She owned the retreat.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.680
Mattie.
- Cause of death?

22:57.680 --> 22:59.080
Hyperthermia,
by the looks of it.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.600
Mattie.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.280
I found traces of red paint
on the door handle,

23:02.280 --> 23:04.080
suggesting something may have
been used to prop it shut.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.680
Coo-ee, Mattie!

23:07.680 --> 23:09.280
Mattie!

23:09.280 --> 23:11.120
She's not gonna stop
till she speaks to you, is she?

23:11.120 --> 23:14.600
- Afraid not, sir.
- Go on.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.200
This had better be important.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.920
Jane's been researching
steam generators.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.280
According to the installer
I spoke to,

23:21.280 --> 23:24.840
it's almost impossible
for generators to overheat,

23:24.840 --> 23:27.480
unless they have
been tampered with.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.480
It's locked, sir.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.000
Foster, break the door down.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.200
Sir.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.840
Stand back, everyone.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.560
Get up, Foster.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.200
Give me a minute.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.320
Have you got a credit card?

23:51.320 --> 23:56.120
Oh, it's the old
credit card in the --

23:57.440 --> 23:58.920
....door trick.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.400
That will pay for the damage.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.480
What are you doing here?!
This is a crime scene!

24:17.480 --> 24:19.120
Sir.

24:23.280 --> 24:26.520
Looks like the safety valve
has been manually overridden.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.520
And look.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.720
Paint samples match.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.160
Someone used this broom
to prop the steam room door shut

24:38.160 --> 24:40.400
to prevent Dr. Isherwood
from escaping.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.600
- Instigate a murder inquiry.
- Sir.

24:42.600 --> 24:45.920
And if I hear even a whisper
that you three are meddling...

24:45.920 --> 24:49.920
We promise
you won't hear a thing.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.280
Excuse me, Inspector.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.480
Yes?

24:53.480 --> 24:57.080
I know you don't want us
involved,

24:57.080 --> 25:01.080
but I have just spotted
something between those tubs.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.200
It looks like a false nail.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.720
Lemon Meringue Pie.
The color.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.240
Same color that
self-obsessed brat had on

25:14.240 --> 25:15.840
by the pool yesterday.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.600
Did you catch her name?

25:19.200 --> 25:22.360
- Yasmin Hayes?
- Yeah, what's going on?

25:22.360 --> 25:24.720
Detective Sergeant Stone,
Marsh Valley Police.

25:24.720 --> 25:27.480
- Detective Inspector Thorne.
- Check the bathroom.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.520
Step aside, please.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.480
Can you account for
your whereabouts

25:42.480 --> 25:44.120
between 10:00 and 10:30
last night?

25:44.120 --> 25:45.600
What's this about?

25:45.600 --> 25:47.280
As I said, can you account
for your whereabouts

25:47.280 --> 25:49.160
between 10:00 and 10:30
last night?

25:49.160 --> 25:52.160
Look, I had a bottle
of "proscexio,"

25:52.160 --> 25:53.680
feeling a little bit hungover,

25:53.680 --> 25:56.480
and would kind of like you
to be out of my space.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.880
I mean, you're not gonna
find anything,

25:57.880 --> 26:00.760
so you might as well just leave.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.360
Lemon Meringue Pie?

26:02.360 --> 26:04.080
It's my shade.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.080
Grace Mulberry's
missing pass card.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.080
Look, this is ridiculous.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.040
I'm calling my solicitor.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.720
What have you done
with my phone?

26:13.720 --> 26:16.120
Yasmin Hayes, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder

26:16.120 --> 26:17.720
of Dr. Angela Isherwood.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.120
What?

26:19.120 --> 26:21.560
Old Iron Britches is dead?

26:21.560 --> 26:23.240
You're making a serious mistake.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.440
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

26:25.440 --> 26:26.960
- if you do not mention --
- This is crazy.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.440
I want my phone
and I want my solicitor.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.800
You're gonna regret this,
I promise.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.200
I was drinking
on the roof terrace all evening.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.640
Don't be disappointed,
Sergeant.

26:48.640 --> 26:51.120
Not all murder cases
are complex mysteries.

26:51.120 --> 26:54.120
We may not have the motive yet,
but the facts are obvious.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.960
- Ladies.

26:56.960 --> 27:00.480
What -- What's going on?

27:00.480 --> 27:02.680
My sister owns this place,
and I demand to know

27:02.680 --> 27:06.800
what's going on, irregardless.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.280
Maybe we should sit down,
Mr. Isherwood.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.320
There's something
I need to tell you.

27:17.240 --> 27:20.720
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

27:20.720 --> 27:22.920
That everything's a little bit
too convenient.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.520
Well, you heard
Inspector Thorne --

27:24.520 --> 27:26.920
the facts are obvious.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.800
But he's forgetting
Sherlock Homes.

27:28.800 --> 27:32.000
Yes, there's nothing
more deceptive than an --

27:32.000 --> 27:33.840
...obvious fact.

27:37.920 --> 27:43.120
I've just heard the news.
I'm so sorry, Alistair.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.520
Maybe we should close
the retreat out of respect.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.320
Oh, we can't do that.

27:48.320 --> 27:49.920
Why not?

27:49.920 --> 27:53.760
Our finances have taken
a bit of a hit recently.

27:53.760 --> 27:58.760
If we close, even temporarily,
it'll sink the place.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.360
Dr. Isherwood would never
have wanted that.

28:05.360 --> 28:09.680
Then we stay open for Angela.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.840
Yeah.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.520
DR.<i>
Good morning.</i>

28:13.520 --> 28:17.080
<i>The Wildemarsh Wellness Retreat

28:17.080 --> 28:18.880

28:21.520 --> 28:24.440
George.

28:24.440 --> 28:27.840
I'm sorry I never called you
back after our date.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.080
It's okay.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.880
I just figured
you lost my number.

28:30.880 --> 28:33.480
So I set this whole thing up
so I could see you again.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.680
Arrest me.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.720
George, you coming or not?

28:38.720 --> 28:41.240
I'd better go.
Maybe see you again?

28:41.240 --> 28:42.880
I'd like that.

29:00.640 --> 29:03.400
The same lipstick shade
as Yasmin Hayes.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.400
That proves she was out here,
just not when.

29:05.400 --> 29:09.200
Oh, look, a desire path
leading to the woods.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.520
A what?

29:10.520 --> 29:11.920
It's an unintended path

29:11.920 --> 29:14.720
caused as a consequence
of human footfall.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.480
<i>It was at times
like these that Cat Stone</i>

29:17.480 --> 29:20.760
<i>decided her 14 months spent
living off the grid...</i>

29:23.080 --> 29:25.400
<i>...hadn't been a waste of time
after all.</i>

29:25.400 --> 29:28.000
- Did it rain last night?
- A bit, about 9:00.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.200
I remember thinking it's the
first rain we've had in weeks.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.080
What time did Lord Overshaw
claim he went to bed?

29:34.080 --> 29:36.080
Have you heard?
Terrible.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.480
Did you see anything unusual
going on last night?

29:38.480 --> 29:40.320
No, I was asleep by 8:00.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.880
What? What don't I know?

29:45.880 --> 29:47.520
Tell me!

29:48.880 --> 29:50.480
Can you explain why we found

29:50.480 --> 29:52.520
one of your false nails
in the maintenance room

29:52.520 --> 29:55.280
and Grace Mulberry's pass card
in your bedroom?

29:55.280 --> 29:57.960
Someone must have planted them.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.520
I didn't kill anyone.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.520
If anyone had beef
with Dr. Isherwood,

30:02.520 --> 30:04.960
it's that ratchet Rowena Walker.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.960
It's her you should
be interviewing.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.160
What makes you say that?

30:09.160 --> 30:12.400
Because after Dr. Isherwood
announced her successor,

30:12.400 --> 30:14.880
I saw the two of them
having a blazing row.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.520
This must be a shortcut
to Rachel's Papers.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.320
Matilda attended a break-in
there yesterday.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.400
- Chocolate theft.
- Ahh!

30:29.400 --> 30:32.720
I told you, I was hiding
out on the roof terrace.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.360
Cigarettes and alcohol
are prohibited.

30:35.360 --> 30:39.200
Is there anyone who can
corroborate your whereabouts?

30:39.200 --> 30:41.720
I've been through the belongings
of Dr. Isherwood's locker.

30:41.720 --> 30:44.200
There's no sign
of her mobile phone.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.800
Go back to the retreat,
take another look.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.920
Make finding it a priority.

30:47.920 --> 30:52.760
What part of hiding out
do you not understand?

30:52.760 --> 30:54.320
Why stay at the retreat at all

30:54.320 --> 30:56.160
if you're going to
smoke and drink?

30:59.360 --> 31:00.800
I'm weak.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.200
Sue me.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.240
- Today, Foster.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.680
Sir.

31:12.560 --> 31:16.120
<i>While a bitter Yasmin Hayes
continued her protestations</i>

31:16.120 --> 31:19.360
<i>of innocence,
Beth, Cat, and Jane Stone</i>

31:19.360 --> 31:24.040
<i>were soon to hear protestations
involving a far sweeter crime.</i>

31:32.880 --> 31:34.480
Target on the move.

32:08.520 --> 32:12.320
Oh!

32:13.520 --> 32:16.320
- Ohh.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.520
I can explain.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.120
Terry, we've been searching
for you all over.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.520
Me?

32:23.520 --> 32:25.560
Someone wants to speak
to a police officer.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.120
My name is
Lord Reginald Overshaw

32:37.120 --> 32:38.760
and I'm a choccyholic.

32:46.160 --> 32:49.200
Is being a chocoholic
even a thing?

32:49.200 --> 32:53.240
Giving up smoking is easier
than giving up chocolate.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.560
Whenever the cravings
get too much,

32:55.560 --> 32:58.520
I make a break for Wildemarsh.

32:58.520 --> 33:02.600
I hang around outside Rachel's
Papers until the coast is clear

33:02.600 --> 33:08.280
and then I break in and steal as
much chocolate as I can carry.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.880
Why steal?

33:09.880 --> 33:12.080
You're not poor.

33:12.080 --> 33:16.720
Never marry outside your age,
my mother used to say.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.920
She was a very wise woman.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.640
My wife's the one who insists
I stay here.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.960
She knows what I'm like.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.120
Makes me hand over my wallet.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.520
Well, I take it you plan
to compensate Rachel's Papers

33:29.520 --> 33:30.920
for the trouble you've caused?

33:30.920 --> 33:33.920
Yes, yes, of course,
of course, of course.

33:33.920 --> 33:36.360
But that's not why
I'm telling you all this.

33:38.920 --> 33:42.200
Last night, my cravings
were worse than ever.

33:42.200 --> 33:45.160
My stash was out of bounds
in my old room.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.960
So I made another visit
to Rachel's Papers.

33:47.960 --> 33:51.960
Turned out to be a wasted
journey, as when I got there,

33:51.960 --> 33:55.760
the owner was installing
a security camera.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.600
Now, I'm no fan of Yasmin Hayes,

33:57.600 --> 34:00.080
but I saw her drinking
on the roof terrace

34:00.080 --> 34:05.080
both on my way to and on my way
back from Wildemarsh,

34:05.080 --> 34:08.880
and the times match up with
when the killer struck.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.080
Yasmin Hayes couldn't have
killed Dr. Isherwood.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.720
I'm her alibi.

34:19.160 --> 34:20.960
I'll need you to come
to the station

34:20.960 --> 34:23.160
and tell Sergeant Stone
everything you just told me.

34:23.160 --> 34:24.800
Yes, of course.

34:27.720 --> 34:29.360
Ladies.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.680
You coming, Cat?

34:34.680 --> 34:36.680
Yeah, I'll be along
in a minute.

34:41.240 --> 34:43.400
Released pending
further inquiries.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.920
Sorry, sir.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.120
Lord Overshaw was positive
about the times involved.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.520
Adios.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.920
- Oh, very nice.

34:53.920 --> 34:57.760
Something odd about those
beginner's guides to poker

34:57.760 --> 35:00.920
on Dr. Isherwood's
bookshelves, don't you think?

35:00.920 --> 35:04.120
I wondered what it was
you'd seen.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.840
I mean, if she did win the money
for this place in a poker game,

35:06.840 --> 35:08.520
you'd think she'd be
finished with all that.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.520
You used to play quite a bit,
didn't you?

35:10.520 --> 35:12.320
Yeah, I used to.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.000
I lost my shirt
around the tables.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.200
Why do you think
I stopped playing?

35:17.200 --> 35:20.040
Still, I'd love to know
how she won all that money.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.400
I'm eating by myself tonight,
aren't I?

35:25.400 --> 35:27.240
Yeah, don't wait up.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.880
<i>Despite never having considered
throwing a party</i>

35:34.880 --> 35:38.240
<i>or undergoing unnecessary
cosmetic procedures,</i>

35:38.240 --> 35:41.800
<i>Jane Stone became suddenly
curious about the possibilities</i>

35:41.800 --> 35:44.640
<i>of doing both at the same time.</i>

35:48.280 --> 35:50.880
<i>Meanwhile, after
an afternoon spent</i>

35:50.880 --> 35:53.400
<i>visiting her old
gambling haunts,</i>

35:53.400 --> 35:57.280
<i>Cat Stone's quest to uncover
exactly how Dr. Isherwood</i>

35:57.280 --> 36:00.600
<i>won the money to buy
the Wildemarsh Wellness Retreat</i>

36:00.600 --> 36:02.600
<i>led her to the door of the man</i>

36:02.600 --> 36:05.840
<i>whose winning legacy
haunted her the most.</i>

36:07.440 --> 36:09.680
Cat Stone to see Lucky Jim.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.480
Don't stare at me like that!

36:14.480 --> 36:16.480
- Just give me my phone.
Calm down.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.120
Calm down?! Who are you
to tell me to calm down?

36:19.120 --> 36:21.840
Stop pointing all the time!
Give me my phone!

36:21.840 --> 36:24.240
- I really -- I can't help you.
- Stephen, listen to me!

36:24.240 --> 36:27.000
Right now!

36:27.000 --> 36:29.520
What are you staring at,
grandma?

36:31.720 --> 36:33.920
You haven't heard
the last of this.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.080
Charming.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.560
- Oh, she, uh...

36:42.560 --> 36:46.560
...wanted a personal
training session.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.400
But I-I'm busy.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.640
Were you, um, heading through?

36:52.640 --> 36:55.240
- Yes.
- Mind if I walk with you?

36:55.240 --> 36:57.040
It's a free country.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.960
As sole heir, I understand

37:08.960 --> 37:11.960
Alistair's now going to be
taking over as retreat director.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.720
It's only to be expected.

37:13.720 --> 37:14.920
You don't mind?

37:14.920 --> 37:16.840
It's probably for the best.

37:16.840 --> 37:20.520
In truth, I don't think I was
ready for the responsibility.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.520
Earlier, you said that
Dr. Isherwood

37:22.520 --> 37:25.080
had been like
a fairy godmother to you.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.760
What did you mean?

37:26.760 --> 37:29.560
When I was 14,
I was in a car crash.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.160
Um, my parents were killed,

37:31.160 --> 37:34.760
and I ended up
in an intensive care unit

37:34.760 --> 37:37.280
run by Dr. Isherwood.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.480
It's how I ended up
in this thing.

37:39.480 --> 37:43.920
I was in hospital for months.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.720
Dr. Isherwood must have
taken a shine to me

37:45.720 --> 37:49.520
because when I left,
she stayed in touch.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.280
She even helped pay
for school trips

37:51.280 --> 37:53.240
and driving lessons.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.440
Is that how you came
to work here?

37:55.440 --> 37:57.040
Dr. Isherwood was the one
who suggested

37:57.040 --> 37:58.520
I train as a therapist.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.560
And then when I graduated,
she gave me a job.

38:00.560 --> 38:05.760
Grace, babe, I'm ready
for my acupuncture session.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.320
Um, I-I thought
under the circumstances --

38:08.320 --> 38:09.920
What?

38:09.920 --> 38:11.720
Oh, Dr. Isherwood.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.720
Yeah, I mean, it's all very sad,

38:13.720 --> 38:15.320
but you know
I have to have my acupuncture

38:15.320 --> 38:16.920
at the same time every day,

38:16.920 --> 38:20.920
otherwise it plays havoc
with my circadian rhythms, so...

38:20.920 --> 38:23.040
Do you need me
for anything else?

38:23.040 --> 38:25.680
No, I've got everything I need
for the minute.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.120
I'll meet you
in the treatment room.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.720
Aw, thanks, babe.
You're an angel.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.800
Come in.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.520
I need to ask you
some questions.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.200
Ow, careful.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.520
I understand
you and Dr. Isherwood

39:19.520 --> 39:21.400
were seen arguing
on the night of her death.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.720
Ah, it was more of an exchange
of words than an argument.

39:24.720 --> 39:28.160
And what was your exchange
of words about?

39:28.160 --> 39:31.120
If you must know,
Dr. Isherwood always led me

39:31.120 --> 39:32.760
to believe
that I was going to be the one

39:32.760 --> 39:34.720
running the retreat
after she stepped down.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.120
And you were angry because
she gave the job to Grace?

39:37.120 --> 39:39.360
Well, it hurt to be
cast aside like that

39:39.360 --> 39:43.040
after everything I've done,
but I swear, I had nothing to do

39:43.040 --> 39:45.000
with Dr. Isherwood's death.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.840
Is it me or is it hot in here?

39:49.840 --> 39:51.840
Would you like me
to open a window?

39:51.840 --> 39:53.880
Yeah, thanks, babe.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.800
Where were you last night?

39:55.800 --> 39:57.920
At home with Geoffrey
all evening.

39:57.920 --> 40:00.320
And this Geoffrey
can confirm that?

40:00.320 --> 40:02.560
Not unless you can
speak cat, no.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.280
Terry?

40:19.320 --> 40:20.840
<i>I've had a call</i>

40:20.840 --> 40:22.320
- <i>about Yasmin Hayes.</i>

40:22.320 --> 40:24.000
<i>I asked her local police
to visit her house</i>

40:24.000 --> 40:26.160
<i>to verify her address,
but the door was answered</i>

40:26.160 --> 40:29.760
by another woman
calling herself Yasmin Hayes.

40:29.760 --> 40:30.960
Sorry,
say that again, Terry.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.600
I can hardly hear.

40:32.600 --> 40:35.000
The Yasmin Hayes we arrested
isn't who she says she is.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.600
She's using a false name.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.320
Hold on.
What's that noise?

40:38.320 --> 40:40.720
- Treatment room emergency chord.
- Show me.

40:40.720 --> 40:42.120
Sarge?

40:42.120 --> 40:47.320
<i>Emergency.</i>

40:47.320 --> 40:50.320
- <i>Emergency.</i>

41:09.000 --> 41:10.400
She's dead.
