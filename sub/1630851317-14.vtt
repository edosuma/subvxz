Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:07.572 --> 00:09.270
What the hell is that?

00:09.313 --> 00:10.619
My resignation letter.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.055
You want to talk about it?

00:12.099 --> 00:14.797
God, no. That's why
I wrote you the letter.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.193
Come in here.

00:19.236 --> 00:22.631
God, can we not make
a big thing out of this?

00:22.674 --> 00:25.634
It is a big thing. You're
quitting the family business.

00:25.677 --> 00:30.769
No, I am exploring "new
and exciting opportunities."

00:30.813 --> 00:31.988
What opportunities?

00:33.033 --> 00:37.080
I don't know yet, but I know
they are new and exciting.

00:39.256 --> 00:40.779
Thanks for doing this dinner.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.694
No problem, sweetie.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.653
I actually have
some pretty big news

00:44.696 --> 00:45.654
- to share.
- Did we not get

00:45.697 --> 00:46.959
the garlic knots?

00:47.003 --> 00:48.439
Oh, it's
- right there.
- Here.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.137
Maybe you should eat one
so we both have bad breath.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.268
Good idea.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.140
So, back to my news...

00:53.183 --> 00:54.445
Oh, speaking
of bad breath,

00:54.489 --> 00:56.012
Douglas, tell 'em
about the gift I got you.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.579
Mom got me a toothbrush.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.755
With a Waterpik built in!

00:59.798 --> 01:01.148
- Do those work?
- Oh, yeah!

01:01.191 --> 01:03.063
It's like a bidet
for your mouth.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.325
So, my thing...

01:04.368 --> 01:07.328
Bob does not floss as
much as I would like.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.590
I have sensitive gums.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.113
That's why flossing's
important, Bob.

01:10.157 --> 01:10.983
I got a job!

01:11.027 --> 01:12.376
- Oh, my God!
- Hey!

01:12.420 --> 01:14.465
- That's incredible!
- Christina, that's wonderful!

01:14.509 --> 01:15.858
Thank you.

01:15.901 --> 01:17.512
That's amazing.
Where are you working?

01:17.555 --> 01:20.341
It's an online company
called Toesey Woesies.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.777
Oh, no.

01:21.820 --> 01:24.084
Are you selling pictures
of your feet again?

01:25.085 --> 01:26.434
No!

01:26.477 --> 01:27.957
I'm the chief
brand manager.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.132
They brought
me on board

01:29.176 --> 01:31.134
to take their footwear
to the next level.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.701
Oh.
- Oh.
- That sounds like

01:32.744 --> 01:34.703
a great opportunity, Christina. Yeah.

01:34.746 --> 01:37.445
Yeah, I-I really feel like
I'm a part of something special.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.534
You know, right now,
it's just eight of us

01:39.577 --> 01:41.536
working out of
the boss's garage.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.412
Garages are cool.
I love my garage.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.762
Plenty of great companies
have started out of garages.

01:50.806 --> 01:51.763
Apple.

01:51.807 --> 01:52.938
Mm-hmm.

01:54.679 --> 01:56.551
Other ones.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.379
There is a lot
of room for growth

01:58.422 --> 01:59.728
- in a company like that
- Yeah.

01:59.771 --> 02:02.644
That is what I said
- in my interview!
- Yes.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.472
It's gonna be fine, honey.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.996
Yeah, I-I know
it's gonna be fine.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.171
I'm not worried.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.999
Neither are we.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.261
Oh,

02:11.305 --> 02:12.828
you know, there is one thing...

02:12.871 --> 02:13.959
I knew it.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.657
You got to show more than feet.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.703
No. Uh, Toesey Woesies

02:18.747 --> 02:20.009
sells socks.

02:20.052 --> 02:23.099
So I'll be working
for a competitor.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.014
In a garage.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.671
I wouldn't worry about that.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.238
We're proud of you.

02:31.281 --> 02:33.196
- Mm-hmm.
- And no matter what people say,

02:33.240 --> 02:35.546
any job that makes a
paycheck is a good gig.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.895
- Yes.
- Well,

02:36.939 --> 02:39.376
actually, they're paying me
in stock options.

02:41.509 --> 02:42.945
That is terrible.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.017
Poor Christina.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.716
- What?
- This Toesey Woesies thing, I mean,

03:14.759 --> 03:16.935
who the hell's gonna pay $20
for a pair of socks?

03:16.979 --> 03:19.068
What's that printed
all over them?

03:19.111 --> 03:20.983
It's either a kid
with a weird head

03:21.026 --> 03:22.637
or a smiling taco.

03:23.725 --> 03:26.162
Why would they put
a disfigured child on a sock?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.164
Okay, it's a taco.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.079
Still not worth
20 bucks.

03:30.122 --> 03:31.994
This company's
gonna go under in a month.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.343
You never know.

03:33.387 --> 03:36.868
People buy many stupid things
on the Internet.

03:36.912 --> 03:39.610
Like a little tiny vacuum
for your car.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.658
Do you want to sit in crumbs?
'Cause I don't.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.923
Maybe I could throw some
MaxDot business Christina's way.

03:47.966 --> 03:50.055
You are a
- good brother.
- Well, I'm not gonna let

03:50.099 --> 03:52.623
my baby sister dive headfirst
into an empty pool.

03:52.667 --> 03:53.624
Mm-hmm.

03:53.668 --> 03:54.799
Wait.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.324
Toesey Woesies
was on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

03:57.367 --> 04:00.152
Mm, not everyone on that show
goes on to be successful.

04:00.196 --> 04:04.287
They grossed $218 million
last year!

04:04.331 --> 04:05.636
Really?

04:05.680 --> 04:08.291
Maybe they could send
some business your way.

04:12.339 --> 04:15.298
Tunde, I'm going out
to run some errands.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.908
Ah. Have a wonderful time.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.563
Are you going to be
okay here by yourself?

04:19.607 --> 04:20.651
Oh, yes.

04:20.695 --> 04:24.351
Because I will be doing
a lot of...

04:24.394 --> 04:26.048
this.

04:26.091 --> 04:27.789
Have fun.

04:27.832 --> 04:30.182
Oh, it will be torture
without you,

04:30.226 --> 04:32.837
but, somehow, I will survive.

Where have you been?

05:57.792 --> 05:59.228
Uh, running errands.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.708
I came to see you.

06:00.751 --> 06:03.101
I have been waiting
nearly six hours.

06:03.145 --> 06:06.148
Check your phone next time, dear.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.193
For the love of God.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.326
I'm sorry.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.372
The day must have gotten away
from me.

06:12.415 --> 06:13.721
As did the dusting.

06:13.764 --> 06:16.550
Did you notice your
bedroom ceiling fan was filthy?

06:16.593 --> 06:19.683
No. I have not
inspected it lately.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.119
Well, I did.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.556
But do not worry--

06:22.599 --> 06:25.254
I got right up on your bed
and scrubbed it clean.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.430
I had to hold her legs.

06:27.474 --> 06:28.953
Why don't you answer your phone?

06:30.781 --> 06:33.131
I also ironed all
of Tunde's shirts

06:33.175 --> 06:35.743
and bleached your filthy floors.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.005
My floors were clean.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.441
They were brown.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.922
That was the varnish!

06:40.965 --> 06:42.271
Now that you are home,

06:42.314 --> 06:44.447
I trust that you have
a plan for dinner.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.105
Olu, you did not.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.759
I did.

06:51.802 --> 06:52.760
It is fine!

06:52.803 --> 06:55.284
It is my cheat day.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.329
You have had a cheat lifetime.

06:58.243 --> 07:02.770
Olu, since when do you neglect
your household and your husband?

07:02.813 --> 07:05.120
Never, sister.
I will toss this out

07:05.163 --> 07:06.338
and make a home-cooked meal.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.644
Ah, no.

07:07.688 --> 07:08.819
You do not want this food

07:08.863 --> 07:11.300
stinking up
your freshly scrubbed kitchen.

07:11.343 --> 07:14.477
I will take it to the dumpster
on the street.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.567
I might be a while.

07:22.137 --> 07:23.791
"This bird may be flying,

07:23.834 --> 07:26.794
"but she will never forget
where she was hatched.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.622
Love,
Christina."

07:28.665 --> 07:30.493
What a thoughtful gesture.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.800
Oh, that's a rough-looking kid.

07:32.843 --> 07:35.019
It's a smiling taco.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.847
Oh, the hair's cheese!

07:36.891 --> 07:38.501
That's cute!

07:39.894 --> 07:41.373
What's going on?

07:41.417 --> 07:44.246
Christina sent us socks
from her little Internet job.

07:44.289 --> 07:45.639
I have done some investigating,

07:45.682 --> 07:47.467
and it is
a very successful company.

07:47.510 --> 07:48.598
I know.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.383
They grossed $218 million
last year!

07:51.427 --> 07:52.384
I know!

07:53.385 --> 07:54.517
The box is also

07:54.561 --> 07:56.345
completely biodegradable.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.520
You can eat it.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.522
Don't eat the box.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.352
Christina suggested
the foot-shaped packaging

08:03.395 --> 08:04.527
when she was here.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.528
Are you sure?

08:05.572 --> 08:07.225
When she presented it, you said,

08:07.269 --> 08:09.401
"Honey, are you on something?"

08:10.794 --> 08:12.666
Doesn't sound like me.

08:12.709 --> 08:14.058
Mom, to be fair,

08:14.102 --> 08:16.670
you were always shooting down
her ideas.

08:16.713 --> 08:17.932
Well, so were you.

08:17.975 --> 08:20.195
Every time she opened
her mouth, you'd groan.

08:20.238 --> 08:23.198
This is why I keep
my ideas to myself.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.243
I would love to hear your ideas, Douglas.

08:26.767 --> 08:30.510
I don't have any.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.425
- Get her back.
- We can't do that.

08:33.469 --> 08:34.557
- Why not?
- Well, number one,

08:34.601 --> 08:35.906
she's got her dream job now.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.474
Number two,
we already filled her position.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.219
All right, new guy,
what do you got?

08:44.262 --> 08:46.700
Well, I was thinking, perhaps,

08:46.743 --> 08:49.093
with every sock MaxDot sells,

08:49.137 --> 08:51.487
we donate a pair
to people in need.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.880
I call it "Care Pairs."

08:53.750 --> 08:55.752
Honey, are you on something?

09:03.064 --> 09:06.589
Whoever gave you this
recipe is not your friend.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.417
This is Mummy's recipe.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.418
I do not think so.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.898
Mummy's recipe is not runny.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.203
It is not runny.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.771
Run-ny.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.601
Tunde has barely
even touched it.

09:18.645 --> 09:19.950
Why are you not eating?

09:21.038 --> 09:23.693
Because I ate the
Wendy's on the sidewalk.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.740
Maybe if you had
not been out all day,

09:26.783 --> 09:29.481
you would have had time to
make a decent meal for him.

09:29.525 --> 09:32.180
Thank you for your advice, sister.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.752
Tomorrow, you should make
braised goat with obe ata.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.928
Not even you could ruin that.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.669
That takes two days to make.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.322
Well, we will start tonight.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.497
I'm very tired.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.760
How do you
think I feel?

09:46.803 --> 09:48.109
I have done your work all day.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.850
I did not ask you
to do that.

09:49.893 --> 09:50.807
Someone had to.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.200
Yes, you are the perfect wife.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.115
I am.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.291
That is how I have kept
my husband happy

09:56.334 --> 09:57.466
all of these years.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.947
And yet you are
6,000 miles from him,

09:59.990 --> 10:01.775
with no plans to go back!

10:01.818 --> 10:04.995
Excuse me! I have this thing in
the other room I have to go to.

10:08.999 --> 10:12.307
I cannot believe this is how
you treat a guest in your home.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.962
Guest? I do not remember
inviting you.

10:15.005 --> 10:17.617
I do not need to listen to this.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.967
You are as insulting and
as tasteless as your stew!

10:20.010 --> 10:25.015
Maybe you would have preferred
it be cold and bitter like you!

10:26.669 --> 10:28.192
Is it safe?

10:28.236 --> 10:29.541
It is safe.

10:29.585 --> 10:30.717
Ah.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.810
I have no idea
why we don't do

10:36.853 --> 10:39.073
these mother-daughter
coffee dates more often.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.509
I agree.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.206
Now that we don't work
together anymore,

10:42.250 --> 10:44.948
we can just be gal pals.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.342
Sure.

10:47.385 --> 10:48.996
Oh.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.694
Sorry. It's work.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.001
Hey, is this an emergency?

10:54.044 --> 10:55.872
Then I'm gonna stop you
right there.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.526
I'm having coffee
with my mother,

10:57.569 --> 10:58.701
so please give
the report

10:58.745 --> 11:00.877
to my assistant
and I'll circle back.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.836
Okay, bye!

11:02.879 --> 11:05.055
Sorry, where were we?

11:05.099 --> 11:06.840
Boy, you've come a long way

11:06.883 --> 11:09.712
from the girl who sat
- in the yard eating dirt.
- Mm.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.497
Yeah, I'm on iron pills now.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.543
Whatever you did,
it's working.

11:14.586 --> 11:17.894
Mm. Well, I had a very strong
woman as a role model.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.156
Thank you, honey.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.724
I meant Abishola.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.986
But of course you, too.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.555
Well, I'm very proud of you.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.818
Thank you, Mom.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.255
Anyhoo...

11:33.910 --> 11:36.521
If you could
just sign this.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.175
Well, what is it?

11:38.219 --> 11:40.047
Something to make sure that
business doesn't get in the way

11:40.090 --> 11:41.613
of family.

11:41.657 --> 11:44.094
It's just a silly little
document that states

11:44.138 --> 11:48.229
any ideas you thought of at
MaxDot are property of MaxDot.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.057
I-I don't understand.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.493
It's very standard language.

11:51.536 --> 11:55.062
You hated every one
of my ideas when I worked there.

11:55.105 --> 11:59.414
Honey, just because I hated them
doesn't mean they're not mine.

11:59.457 --> 12:02.156
They're not yours.
They came from my mind.

12:02.199 --> 12:05.637
A mind which came
out of my body.

12:05.681 --> 12:08.945
Come on, you're a big girl now.
This is how business works.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.512
I am not signing that.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.863
You want to go
that route, fine.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.612
A cease and desist order?

12:23.655 --> 12:25.875
You like dirt--
let's play in the mud.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.493
What are you doing?

12:36.538 --> 12:39.106
Just thinking
about how I'm gonna die here.

12:39.149 --> 12:41.543
Well, do it somewhere else.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.111
That's the point, Bob.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.503
There is
nowhere else.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.114
There's just
these four walls,

12:47.157 --> 12:48.550
and they're closing in.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.814
You got to stop drinking
at work.

12:51.858 --> 12:52.946
I'm not drinking.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.295
I'm toasting.

12:54.338 --> 12:58.168
To Christina,
who found a way to escape.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.344
You know, if you're
really not happy here,

13:00.388 --> 13:03.695
you could leave and
pursue something else.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.915
I don't have the balls.

13:07.438 --> 13:09.397
Yeah, me neither.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.358
To Christina.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.843
You know, when Dad died,

13:20.887 --> 13:22.105
I had a choice--

13:22.149 --> 13:24.281
stay in school
or come help here.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.022
- You picked wrong.
- I know I picked wrong.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.505
Could've had
a whole different life.

13:30.548 --> 13:33.987
I would be the voice
of the Toledo Mud Hens,

13:34.030 --> 13:36.511
calling all their
games on AM radio.

13:36.554 --> 13:37.991
That's a minor league team.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.993
I'm a simple man, Douglas.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.037
Hmm.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.647
What about you?

13:45.302 --> 13:46.956
I'm here.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.873
In every timeline, I'm here.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.398
Yeah, sorry, buddy.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.754
Usually when someone gets
a new job,

14:02.798 --> 14:04.887
their family gives 'em
an "attagirl,"

14:04.931 --> 14:06.541
not an injunction.

14:06.584 --> 14:09.761
Man, you rich people
love to sue each other.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.894
Well, I can tell you,
I do not love this.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.722
Your mother is
just trying to scare you.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.680
Why? She should be happy.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.900
Happy that her daughter
no longer needs her?

14:17.944 --> 14:19.902
- Don't be stupid.
- Well,

14:19.946 --> 14:21.382
I'm sure you wouldn't do
something like that

14:21.425 --> 14:22.383
to your children.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.733
I would destroy my son's career

14:24.776 --> 14:26.866
if it meant he would
talk to me again.

14:28.389 --> 14:31.087
She's the wrong person
to ask about family stuff.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.741
I'm proud of you.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.743
Leaving MaxDot
was very brave.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.919
- Now my mom hates me
- Mm-mm.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.921
She doesn't hate you.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.923
What she hates is
that you got away.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.925
And that you are succeeding without her.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.797
And not appreciating all the
hard work that she put into you.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.495
And the sacrifices
that she made.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.149
Like staying in a
loveless marriage

14:49.192 --> 14:50.977
so you could have a
roof over your head.

14:53.109 --> 14:56.417
Yeah, that's not
really my story.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.202
It is all you ungrateful
children's stories.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.598
Wait, so, in a weird way,

15:03.641 --> 15:05.469
she doesn't hate me.

15:05.513 --> 15:07.167
She's jealous of me.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.342
Jealous?

15:08.385 --> 15:10.170
Why would she be jealous of you?

15:10.213 --> 15:12.955
You are successful
because of her!

15:12.999 --> 15:14.435
Stupid, ungrateful children.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.395
I think you're onto something.

15:18.439 --> 15:21.224
Ha! Jealous. Idiot.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.409
<i>E kaasan,</i> sister.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.283
Make your apology and go.

15:36.326 --> 15:39.068
I have to re-mop
these floors.

15:39.112 --> 15:42.463
Bob's cleaning lady
uses organic products.

15:42.506 --> 15:43.986
She may as well do nothing
at all!

15:45.727 --> 15:47.859
I am not here
to apologize.

15:47.903 --> 15:49.992
You insulted me in my own home.

15:50.036 --> 15:53.039
Only after you almost killed
me with that runny soup.

15:53.082 --> 15:54.214
It was stew.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.955
It was soup!

15:58.609 --> 16:00.481
Do you know
why I left Nigeria?

16:00.524 --> 16:02.962
Because Tunde was going
to take another wife.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.052
His family
were forcing him to.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.663
Because I could not produce children.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.146
I said many prayers for you.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.234
And God sent

16:14.277 --> 16:16.018
many blessings.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.325
Tunde and I
are happy here.

16:18.368 --> 16:21.502
Away from the judgment
of others.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.895
We do not judge you.
We pity you.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.333
And I pity you.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.030
Eh-eh! Me?

16:28.074 --> 16:29.727
I have done everything right.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.860
And yet you are still not happy.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.731
I am very happy!

16:34.689 --> 16:36.865
I suppose you are so happy

16:36.908 --> 16:38.562
you do not want this.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.174
What is this?

16:41.217 --> 16:43.306
A movie ticket.

16:43.350 --> 16:47.180
Maybe, instead of
scrubbing floors,

16:47.223 --> 16:49.225
you could have fun
with your sister.

16:53.664 --> 16:56.232
Does this movie have
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson?

16:57.277 --> 16:59.366
I think they all do.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.281
It is the middle of the day.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.630
What will people say?

17:02.673 --> 17:04.545
Ah, we are old.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.286
We do not get judgment.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.505
We get discounts.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.252
Hello?

17:16.296 --> 17:18.385
I have Christina Wheeler
for Bob Wheeler.

17:18.428 --> 17:19.386
Uh, okay.

17:19.429 --> 17:20.604
Please hold.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.258
Hold? You called me.

17:23.303 --> 17:26.219
Hey, Bob.
Thanks for taking my call.

17:26.262 --> 17:27.611
Is Mom with you?

17:27.655 --> 17:29.613
Yeah, we're all about to start
the sales meeting.

17:29.657 --> 17:32.181
Oh, perfect.
Can you put me on speaker?

17:32.225 --> 17:34.357
Christina would like
to talk to everyone,

17:34.401 --> 17:37.099
and, apparently,
she's got an assistant now.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.188
Can everyone hear me?

17:39.232 --> 17:41.190
You sound wonderful.

17:41.234 --> 17:44.106
Did you have a chance
to think about our proposal?

17:44.150 --> 17:45.368
I did.

17:45.412 --> 17:48.458
And I just want to thank you
for suing me.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.721
- We're suing her?
- No.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.593
We're threatening to sue her.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.029
This is why
I can't leave.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.336
I'm not a loser--
I'm a prisoner.

17:57.859 --> 18:01.471
This lawsuit has shown me
that you respect my talents.

18:01.515 --> 18:02.559
Why would you sue her?

18:02.603 --> 18:04.779
Because she loves and misses me, Bob.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.520
All right,
you found out

18:06.563 --> 18:08.435
about my dirty little secret.
Now come back.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.828
Aw, I can't. You know,

18:10.872 --> 18:13.657
seeing the lengths that
you would go to for my ideas

18:13.701 --> 18:15.790
was the validation I needed.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.619
Every subpoena is a tiny hug.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.273
Bobby, she's not afraid
of me anymore.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.622
Do something.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.667
Ch-Christina, I'm
still playing catch-up,

18:23.711 --> 18:25.147
but we do miss you here.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.410
If you come back,
we'll give you a raise.

18:27.454 --> 18:30.805
Uh, how about a raise for
the people that stayed loyal?

18:30.848 --> 18:32.502
Excellent question, Douglas.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.245
And now

18:36.289 --> 18:37.812
you're throwing money at me?

18:37.855 --> 18:39.988
Mm. My heart is full.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.816
Well,

18:41.859 --> 18:44.645
this has been great,
but I got to go.

18:44.688 --> 18:47.038
Fly away,
little bird, fly!

18:47.082 --> 18:48.997
Don't you hang up, Christina.
We're not through talking

18:49.040 --> 18:51.173
about this!
I'm sorry. Ms. Wheeler is no longer available.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.653
Would you like to schedule
another time?

18:52.696 --> 18:55.525
I have Thursday at 3:00 p.m.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.397
That works for me.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.232
There is hardly
anybody here.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.234
That is why I come
during the day.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.671
The theater is mine.

19:12.847 --> 19:15.328
Here, have some popcorn.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.025
I did extra butter.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.897
If we eat it now, there will be
none left when the movie starts.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.247
There are free refills.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.858
- No.
- Yes.

19:23.901 --> 19:27.035
Surely it is to make us thirsty
and purchase more drinks.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.472
There are free refills
on drinks as well.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.736
It is as if we
are stealing from them.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.564
This truly is a
country of fools.

19:35.522 --> 19:36.436
Hold this.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.398
Eh-eh. What are you doing?

19:43.617 --> 19:45.488
Changing your life.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.670
Mmm!

19:53.714 --> 19:56.238
I jumped once
during a scary movie

19:56.282 --> 19:58.632
and invented
this wonderful snack.

20:02.505 --> 20:03.985
Can I tell you a secret?

20:04.028 --> 20:06.117
Of course.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.858
My husband has not
called the entire time

20:07.902 --> 20:09.338
I have been in Detroit.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.254
Do you want to talk
about it?

20:13.299 --> 20:14.909
No.

20:17.477 --> 20:20.219
That is the great thing
about movies--

20:20.262 --> 20:21.785
for a little while,

20:21.829 --> 20:25.224
you can just sit
in the dark and forget.
