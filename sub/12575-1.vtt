00:28.628 --> 00:29.788
Yep.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.258
Yep.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.093
Yep.

00:39.305 --> 00:42.934
You know what it could be?
That damn starter motor.

00:43.576 --> 00:45.544
You getting good compression?

00:45.678 --> 00:46.770
Yeah.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.477
I know what's wrong with it.

00:49.682 --> 00:51.047
It's a Ford.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.976
You know what they say
Ford stands for, don't you?

00:54.154 --> 00:56.645
It stands for "Fix It Again, Tony."

00:57.424 --> 00:59.756
You're thinking of a Fiat, Dale.

01:00.493 --> 01:03.360
"Fix It Again"...

01:06.366 --> 01:07.993
I'll tell you what you do.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.662
You take them spark plugs out,
and in that little hole...

01:10.737 --> 01:13.365
you put oil round there,
just like Bobby Unser said:

01:13.440 --> 01:16.238
"The shock'd go bo-boom,"
just like that.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.910
Well, I wish it were
that simple, Boomhauer.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.908
But I'll tell you
what my truck really needs.

01:22.982 --> 01:24.006
Leadership.

01:24.451 --> 01:26.851
Detroit hasn't felt any real pride...

01:26.920 --> 01:29.184
since George Bush went to Japan...

01:29.255 --> 01:31.849
and vomited on their auto executives.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.557
Who's ready?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.560
<i>You all catch the
Seinfeld show last night?</i>

01:41.634 --> 01:43.727
- Yep.
- Hell, I missed it.

01:43.803 --> 01:46.863
<i>See that part where
dang old George comes in there?</i>

01:46.940 --> 01:48.840
He talks about tasting his own burp.

01:48.908 --> 01:52.105
And Kramer comes sliding
in just like he always does.

01:52.178 --> 01:55.909
I tell you what, man,
them dang old New York boys.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.011
Just a show about nothing.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.220
What you listening to, son?

02:34.287 --> 02:35.811
I don't think you'd like it.

02:35.889 --> 02:36.878
Well, why not?

02:36.956 --> 02:39.220
I like this new generation of music.

02:41.761 --> 02:42.819
<i>Hello?</i>

02:44.063 --> 02:46.691
Mother of God! It's all toilet sounds!

02:47.100 --> 02:48.533
Where did you record this?

02:48.601 --> 02:50.068
I bought it at the mall.

02:50.136 --> 02:51.694
It's the Funny Phone Jerks.

02:51.771 --> 02:55.798
Let me tell you, Bobby, there's
nothing funny about these sounds.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.911
What that person on your tape has
is a medical disorder.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.272
Now you get ready for the game, okay?

03:02.348 --> 03:03.539
Yes, sir.

03:03.549 --> 03:04.049
Yes, sir.

03:04.249 --> 03:06.046
That boy ain't right.

03:07.920 --> 03:08.852
Oh, God!

03:08.921 --> 03:11.219
Luanne, I thought you went home!

03:11.290 --> 03:13.781
No, Uncle Hank,
Mama and Daddy are still fighting.

03:14.026 --> 03:15.926
Well, you're welcome to stay.

03:15.994 --> 03:18.690
But for God's sakes,
girl, lock the door.

03:18.797 --> 03:21.425
I've got a minor son
living in this house.

03:24.102 --> 03:27.663
<i>So are you ready
to kick some Wildcat butt, Bobby?</i>

03:28.106 --> 03:29.198
Okay.

03:29.341 --> 03:32.640
Now don't you worry, son.
You just do your best.

03:32.711 --> 03:34.372
Don't listen to her, Bobby.

03:34.446 --> 03:38.405
If you want to win, you're gonna have
to do better than your best.

03:38.483 --> 03:40.110
How do I do that?

03:40.185 --> 03:43.120
You gotta give 110 percent.

03:43.555 --> 03:45.750
That's what'll give you
that winning edge.

03:45.824 --> 03:49.282
But what if the Wildcats
give 110 percent, too?

03:49.628 --> 03:51.687
Well, then you gotta try even harder.

03:51.763 --> 03:54.288
How about if Bobby gave 112 percent?

03:54.766 --> 03:56.461
<i>Sure, that'd work.</i>

03:56.535 --> 03:59.504
Or maybe 113.

04:00.706 --> 04:02.799
Yeah, yeah, that's even better.

04:02.874 --> 04:04.171
No, I don't know.

04:04.242 --> 04:06.142
13 is a very unlucky number.

04:06.211 --> 04:08.509
Look, we're not talking about 13.

04:08.580 --> 04:11.105
We're talking about 113.

04:11.183 --> 04:12.616
And even...

04:12.684 --> 04:15.710
Okay, give 112, what's the difference?

04:15.787 --> 04:18.688
<i>Look, Bobby, just do your best, okay?</i>

04:21.994 --> 04:24.258
<i>Swing, Bobby! Swing! Swing!</i>

04:26.264 --> 04:27.162
Ball one.

04:27.232 --> 04:29.257
Good eye, honey, good eye.

04:30.235 --> 04:32.066
Oh, for crying out loud.

04:33.939 --> 04:37.204
Bobby, you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

04:37.275 --> 04:40.438
And you can't get on base
without taking a swing.

04:40.512 --> 04:43.208
The pitcher could
walk me, couldn't he?

04:43.315 --> 04:45.442
Don't play lawyer-ball, son.

04:45.550 --> 04:48.348
Now you hit the next
one out of the park.

04:51.123 --> 04:52.750
Run!

04:53.258 --> 04:54.247
<i>Run! Run!</i>

04:58.930 --> 05:02.058
Look at the batter, boy!
Watch the ball!

05:02.167 --> 05:03.191
Huh?

05:03.268 --> 05:04.394
What?

05:04.469 --> 05:07.802
Hey, don't look at me!
Keep your eye on the ball.

05:07.873 --> 05:09.841
Keep my eye on the what?

05:09.908 --> 05:12.604
<i>Stop looking at me, boy!
Watch the ball!</i>

05:12.678 --> 05:14.441
Can't hear you, Dad!

05:18.283 --> 05:20.979
Don't worry, Bobby.
You played a good game.

05:21.386 --> 05:26.380
<i>I gotta stop in here for a minute, and
get me some WD-40 and a tap and die.</i>

05:30.529 --> 05:33.327
<i>Manager to
Register 47, please.</i>

05:34.199 --> 05:36.531
<i>I hate this place.</i>

05:36.802 --> 05:39.498
Excuse me,
where is the hardware department?

05:39.571 --> 05:41.971
Where is the hardware department?

05:43.909 --> 05:45.900
What exactly
is it you're looking for?

05:45.977 --> 05:47.808
The hardware department.

05:47.879 --> 05:50.370
But are you looking for, like,
a tool or something?

05:50.449 --> 05:52.644
What difference does it make?

05:53.251 --> 05:54.946
What difference does it make?

05:55.020 --> 05:58.717
Okay, I'm looking for a tap and die
and some WD-40.

05:58.957 --> 05:59.946
Huh.

06:00.058 --> 06:01.753
Well, what is it you're trying to do?

06:01.827 --> 06:05.957
I'm trying to buy a tap and die
and some WD-40...

06:06.064 --> 06:08.555
and get out of this godforsaken store!

06:09.735 --> 06:11.134
And what is a tap and die?

06:11.203 --> 06:12.693
Okay! Forget it!

06:12.771 --> 06:16.263
Let's say I want a hammer!
Do you know what a hammer is?

06:16.341 --> 06:18.502
<i>That's what I want! A damned hammer!</i>

06:18.577 --> 06:20.977
Now where in the hell would I go?

06:21.046 --> 06:24.106
That's that Hank Hill fella
that lives on the block next to us.

06:24.182 --> 06:26.650
<i>- Has a temper, doesn't he?
- Sure does.</i>

06:26.718 --> 06:29.380
Makes you wonder
who gave his boy that black eye.

06:30.255 --> 06:32.450
You're going to have
to pay for that, dude.

06:32.524 --> 06:33.718
You're fired!

06:34.926 --> 06:36.917
- Ella says she saw Hank hit his son.
- Really?

06:37.529 --> 06:40.129
Well, I heard he threatened a clerk
in Mega Lo Mart with a hammer.

06:40.232 --> 06:42.200
Did you hear about Hank Hill?

06:42.267 --> 06:43.427
He beat up his son.

06:43.502 --> 06:46.733
<i>Some ladies in Mega Lo Mart tried
to stop him. He beat them up, too.</i>

06:46.805 --> 06:49.399
<i>Somebody really ought to report him
for the boy's sake.</i>

06:49.741 --> 06:51.675
<i>You say he hit
his son with a bat?</i>

06:52.444 --> 06:55.072
No. That is definitely not acceptable.

06:55.147 --> 06:56.478
I wish I could, ma'am.

06:56.548 --> 07:00.314
But the regulations say we can't take
custody of the boy without an interview.

07:00.385 --> 07:03.946
Don't you worry. He's in the
system now. I am on my way.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.487
Hey, I know what's
wrong with your truck.

07:10.562 --> 07:13.156
It's your "pollution control."

07:13.298 --> 07:15.823
I heard on talk radio
you don't even need them.

07:15.967 --> 07:18.026
They're just an egghead
government plot.

07:18.103 --> 07:21.664
How is cutting down on pollution
a government plot, Dale?

07:21.873 --> 07:23.534
Open up your eyes, man.

07:23.608 --> 07:25.872
They're trying to
control global warming.

07:25.944 --> 07:28.139
Get it? Global.

07:28.213 --> 07:29.305
<i>So what?</i>

07:30.482 --> 07:32.677
That's code for UN commissars
telling Americans...

07:32.751 --> 07:35.413
what temperature
it's gonna be in our outdoors.

07:35.487 --> 07:37.114
I say let the world warm up.

07:37.189 --> 07:40.647
<i>See what Boutros-Boutros-Ghali-Ghali
thinks about that.</i>

07:41.059 --> 07:42.822
We'll grow oranges in Alaska.

07:43.895 --> 07:46.420
Dale, you giblet-head,
we live in Texas.

07:47.599 --> 07:49.590
It's already 110 in the summer.

07:49.668 --> 07:53.297
And if it gets one degree hotter,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

07:54.873 --> 07:57.933
What in God's name
is that thumping sound?

07:59.277 --> 08:01.802
Bobby, why don't you go out
and help your daddy?

08:01.880 --> 08:04.508
You have been watching
way too much TV, son.

08:04.649 --> 08:06.378
Come on, Bobby, up.

08:06.484 --> 08:08.315
No more TV. Turn it off now.

08:11.990 --> 08:13.890
God love that poor man.

08:16.461 --> 08:18.088
There. That's better.

08:26.705 --> 08:28.935
Hello, I'm a social
worker with the state.

08:29.007 --> 08:30.998
Would you mind
if I talk to you for a minute?

08:31.076 --> 08:32.736
<i>Sure. Come on in.</i>

08:33.445 --> 08:35.436
Damn it. There it is again.

08:35.513 --> 08:39.313
Where is that thumping coming from?
It's driving me crazy.

08:40.051 --> 08:42.178
Could be far-off helicopters.

08:42.254 --> 08:44.381
UN helicopters.

08:44.489 --> 08:45.922
Dale, what are you doing?

08:45.991 --> 08:48.926
Give me some light! Now! I can't see!

08:49.761 --> 08:50.785
My arm!

08:50.862 --> 08:52.090
<i>My head!</i>

08:54.599 --> 08:55.691
<i>God!</i>

08:56.067 --> 08:59.002
Mrs. Hill, would you say
your husband has a bad temper?

08:59.070 --> 09:00.162
Who, Hank?

09:00.238 --> 09:02.832
No, Hank is as gentle as a lamb.

09:03.675 --> 09:07.611
Dang, no more bouncing that ball!

09:07.679 --> 09:09.647
Hank, we have a visitor.

09:14.152 --> 09:15.881
<i>So your assertion, Mr. Hill...</i>

09:15.954 --> 09:18.684
is that Bobby got the black eye
at his baseball game?

09:18.757 --> 09:22.386
That is not my assertion.
That's what happened.

09:22.460 --> 09:25.293
- Have you ever hit your son, Mr. Hill?
- No!

09:27.032 --> 09:29.262
What the heck are you writing?

09:29.334 --> 09:31.825
All you gotta write is one word, "no"!

09:31.903 --> 09:35.532
Mr. Hill, I feel that
you're coming from an anger mindset.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.904
And if you're projecting
this anger onto me...

09:37.976 --> 09:40.604
it gives me grave concerns
as to how you facilitate...

09:40.679 --> 09:42.442
your son's growth in private.

09:42.514 --> 09:46.746
Mister, I have not begun
to project my anger onto you.

09:46.885 --> 09:49.820
Mrs. Hill, how did you get this
here on your forehead?

09:49.888 --> 09:51.856
This? Bobby threw his baseball at me.

09:51.923 --> 09:54.016
You threw a baseball at your mother?

09:54.092 --> 09:56.083
Hank, it was an accident.

09:56.695 --> 09:59.926
<i>So would this be the same "baseball"
that gave Bobby the black eye?</i>

10:01.566 --> 10:04.967
Dale, you sure you want to be messing
with Hank's truck when he's not around?

10:05.036 --> 10:07.368
I'm gonna help
get him this alternator off.

10:08.573 --> 10:11.599
Dale, I think you
released the brake cable.

10:11.676 --> 10:12.665
Dale!

10:12.744 --> 10:14.143
No, I didn't.

10:16.047 --> 10:18.140
I guess I better get going.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.111
I got some edging to do.

10:22.587 --> 10:24.748
Do you work
outside the home, Mrs. Hill?

10:24.823 --> 10:27.849
<i>Yes, I do. I'm a substitute
Spanish teacher.</i>

10:30.762 --> 10:32.389
And you just have the one son?

10:33.498 --> 10:35.363
Yeah, we would've liked
to have more kids...

10:35.533 --> 10:38.434
- but Hank has a narrow urethra.
- Peggy!

10:38.503 --> 10:41.267
- In fact, Hank's sperm count...
- That's enough.

10:41.339 --> 10:43.773
What in the hell did
you tell him that for?

10:43.875 --> 10:44.899
He asked me.

10:44.976 --> 10:49.174
He asked you how many kids we have.
He didn't ask you about my glands.

10:49.414 --> 10:52.713
Please, Mr. Hill, loud is not allowed.

10:53.051 --> 10:55.542
What the... "Loud is not allowed"?

10:55.620 --> 10:57.383
<i>Now you listen to me, mister.</i>

10:57.455 --> 11:00.288
I work for a living.
And I mean real work.

11:00.358 --> 11:02.656
Not writing down gobbledygook.

11:02.827 --> 11:05.295
<i>I provide the people
of this community...</i>

11:05.363 --> 11:07.888
with propane and propane accessories.

11:09.033 --> 11:12.002
When I think of all my
hard-earned tax dollars...

11:12.070 --> 11:16.097
going to pay a bunch of little
twig-boy bureaucrats like you...

11:16.174 --> 11:18.301
it just makes me want to...

11:19.177 --> 11:20.269
God, it just...

11:21.446 --> 11:22.378
Hank?

11:22.447 --> 11:26.474
Honey, bring me my BC Headache Powder
and a glass of water.

11:26.751 --> 11:28.343
All right, Hank.

11:28.419 --> 11:31.252
Now, you listen here.
You see that boy?

11:31.322 --> 11:32.482
<i>That's my boy.</i>

11:32.757 --> 11:36.193
And if you ever try to take him away,
so help me God...

11:36.261 --> 11:39.594
I'll tear you a new one
bigger than the Grand Canyon.

11:39.797 --> 11:42.425
Now I want you to get out of my house.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.933
You're not welcome here.

11:44.002 --> 11:47.961
<i>I mean now,
before I give you a black eye! Git!</i>

11:51.009 --> 11:53.239
<i>You want to know about ol' Hank?</i>

11:53.578 --> 11:54.567
Well...

11:54.712 --> 11:56.907
Hank's got a lot of problems.

11:57.015 --> 11:59.882
Hey, baby! How about
a couple of beers!

12:00.184 --> 12:01.481
<i>Sorry, sug', I gotta go.</i>

12:01.553 --> 12:04.249
I got another migraine treatment
with John Redcorn.

12:04.322 --> 12:07.155
Nancy, you've been going
to that healer for 12 years...

12:07.225 --> 12:09.591
and you still get
headaches every night.

12:09.661 --> 12:12.061
Healing process takes time, honey.

12:14.332 --> 12:16.163
<i>Getting back to the Hill family.</i>

12:16.234 --> 12:18.464
Have you ever seen Hank
hit his child, Bobby?

12:18.536 --> 12:22.165
Hank? No sir, Bobby's
his pride and joy...

12:22.340 --> 12:25.070
because of his narrow urethra.

12:26.311 --> 12:28.438
- Are you absolutely sure?
- 100 percent.

12:28.513 --> 12:31.641
You can ask my son.
He's Bobby's best friend.

12:31.716 --> 12:32.910
Joseph!

12:33.017 --> 12:34.575
What is it, Daddy?

12:34.652 --> 12:36.381
You ever seen Hank hit Bobby?

12:36.454 --> 12:37.819
No, never.

12:38.022 --> 12:39.080
<i>See?</i>

12:39.691 --> 12:41.454
You can just move along now.

12:41.559 --> 12:44.323
I've been calling y'all
better than a month now.

12:44.395 --> 12:47.125
Gripe about y'all every time
that dog crosses the street...

12:47.198 --> 12:50.167
starts yapping his jaw 24 hours a day,
and nobody answered.

12:50.234 --> 12:54.398
How you supposed to do anything about that
dog if you just get on your computer?

12:54.472 --> 12:57.066
Ain't gonna come over here
and shut that dang ol' dog up.

12:57.241 --> 13:01.678
And then some weirdo came over and
was asking us a bunch of questions.

13:02.013 --> 13:05.210
Yeah, he asked me
if your dad ever whupped you.

13:05.450 --> 13:07.714
- He hasn't, right?
- Of course not!

13:07.785 --> 13:10.117
You know my dad. He's all bark.

13:10.555 --> 13:12.648
That guy got him mad, though.

13:12.724 --> 13:16.353
My dad was like, "Get out of my house!

13:16.461 --> 13:19.521
"My boy ain't much,
but he's all I got!"

13:21.299 --> 13:23.563
You do great impressions.

13:23.935 --> 13:24.993
Let me try.

13:25.503 --> 13:28.063
"I'll tear you a new one!

13:28.239 --> 13:32.505
"When I get my hands on you,
you little pea-brain...

13:32.944 --> 13:36.243
<i>"I'll bust your butt
into little pieces!"</i>

13:36.781 --> 13:38.146
I knew it!

13:38.983 --> 13:42.146
<i>Good God, Peggy,
this was on my Road & Track.</i>

13:42.820 --> 13:45.812
Luanne! Honey, can we talk to you?

13:45.890 --> 13:48.222
Wait! Not while I'm here.

13:49.394 --> 13:50.827
Mama's in jail.

13:50.895 --> 13:53.159
<i>She was saving
a quart of beer for before bed.</i>

13:53.231 --> 13:55.699
<i>Daddy threw it out.
She went after him with a fork.</i>

13:55.767 --> 13:58.327
<i>The trailer tipped over,
everything went upside down.</i>

13:58.403 --> 14:01.236
<i>It's all gonna be on
Real Stories of the Highway Patrol!</i>

14:01.305 --> 14:05.173
<i>And the wig I styled
for the Beauty Academy is ruined.</i>

14:06.210 --> 14:08.474
<i>What am I gonna do, Uncle Hank?</i>

14:09.847 --> 14:11.041
There, there.

14:11.182 --> 14:14.777
You can stay with us
till your mama comes home.

14:15.353 --> 14:19.153
You'll style a new wig
better than before.

14:19.857 --> 14:21.882
I'll let you use my tools.

14:22.894 --> 14:24.623
Thanks, Uncle Hank.

14:26.230 --> 14:27.857
<i>She has got to go.</i>

14:31.035 --> 14:33.868
Bobby, are you all right? Come on out.

14:33.938 --> 14:35.701
I thought I told you to get lost.

14:35.907 --> 14:36.965
Come on, Bobby.

14:37.241 --> 14:40.142
I can put you with a nice
foster family in North Arlen...

14:40.211 --> 14:42.873
where you can develop
healthy life adaptations.

14:42.947 --> 14:44.278
And they've got a pool.

14:44.348 --> 14:46.111
Honey, let's give him Luanne.

14:46.184 --> 14:49.017
I got a girl in here you
can take right now.

14:49.087 --> 14:51.715
Don't you want to live
in a house with a pool?

14:51.889 --> 14:52.821
No.

14:52.890 --> 14:54.152
<i>See, twig boy?</i>

14:54.225 --> 14:56.750
Now get your skinny butt
off of my property.

14:56.828 --> 15:00.286
Bobby, I know you can't talk
in front of him.

15:00.364 --> 15:03.663
- I said git! Get out of here!
- Okay.

15:03.735 --> 15:07.262
- You are out of control!
- You're out of control, Twiggy.

15:12.810 --> 15:16.007
- Thanks for the latte, Kenneth.
- Anthony, could I see you a minute?

15:16.948 --> 15:18.973
<i>So on this Hill family case...</i>

15:19.050 --> 15:22.247
you couldn't confirm any actual abuse,
but you still recommended...

15:22.320 --> 15:23.685
the state take custody?

15:23.855 --> 15:26.790
Yeah, I mean, the whole neighborhood
was Redneck City.

15:26.858 --> 15:29.452
Did you see in the report,
how he dented my Geo?

15:29.527 --> 15:31.893
"Redneck City." That's pretty funny.

15:32.029 --> 15:34.463
- Where you from, son?
- Los Angeles.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.234
Let's see here, "hit by a baseball."

15:40.037 --> 15:41.061
<i>So...</i>

15:41.139 --> 15:42.436
How did you like ol' Harvey?

15:43.674 --> 15:44.766
Who's Harvey?

15:44.842 --> 15:46.901
He's the Little League coach.

15:46.978 --> 15:49.606
You did talk to the Little
League coach, didn't you?

15:55.253 --> 15:57.915
<i>Son, have you lost your mind?</i>

15:58.022 --> 16:01.958
Wait! Dad, you're not supposed
to yell at me anymore.

16:02.326 --> 16:04.157
The guy from the state said...

16:04.228 --> 16:08.995
your hostility
invalidates our parent-child contract.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.796
You're quoting that twig boy at me?

16:11.869 --> 16:13.359
Hank, the neighbors.

16:13.437 --> 16:16.770
Remember, he said,
"loud is not allowed," Dad...

16:16.841 --> 16:18.809
or they'll take me away.

16:20.444 --> 16:21.775
Oh, God.

16:26.450 --> 16:27.508
Hello?

16:27.585 --> 16:30.383
<i>Is this the Hill residence?
Who am I talking to?</i>

16:30.454 --> 16:31.614
Bobby Hill.

16:31.689 --> 16:34.317
<i>Son, this is
the State Social Services.</i>

16:34.392 --> 16:37.020
<i>We're calling off
our investigation of your father.</i>

16:37.094 --> 16:41.428
<i>The worker that visited you will be
leaving the office and going back to LA.</i>

16:41.499 --> 16:44.764
<i>You please tell your parents
we apologize for the misunderstanding.</i>

16:44.836 --> 16:47.134
Okay. I'll tell them. Bye.

16:47.338 --> 16:49.101
Bobby, who was that?

16:50.942 --> 16:52.409
Wrong number.

17:08.893 --> 17:10.758
I borrowed
your truck this morning, Uncle Hank.

17:10.828 --> 17:14.924
It wouldn't start at first, because of a
clogged fuel line, but I blew it clean.

17:18.169 --> 17:21.073
Hey, Bobby, go plug this
in the garage for me.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.137
Okay.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.938
Want to see something cool?

17:32.617 --> 17:33.709
What in the heck?

17:33.785 --> 17:36.811
<i>Don't you see I'm working here?
Close the dang door.</i>

17:37.255 --> 17:39.246
<i>Bob, just keep put, stop!</i>

17:39.391 --> 17:40.551
<i>Stop hitting that button!</i>

17:40.625 --> 17:41.717
Give me that thing!

17:41.793 --> 17:46.025
Dad, that's not respectful
adult-child growth dialogue.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.998
I'll give you dialogue...

17:48.066 --> 17:51.229
that's not coming from
a center of anger.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.802
Please return the garage door...

17:53.872 --> 17:56.739
to its factory-preset down position!

17:59.277 --> 18:00.904
That is cool.

18:05.016 --> 18:06.847
Bobby, hey!

18:07.919 --> 18:10.046
Please respect...

18:10.288 --> 18:13.519
my fence's right to be a fence.

18:14.292 --> 18:15.316
Now!

18:19.731 --> 18:21.756
You can't do nothing.

18:22.934 --> 18:23.992
Hey! Hey!

18:24.369 --> 18:26.132
You're all wet, Dad!

18:29.808 --> 18:31.173
Creak.

18:33.745 --> 18:34.609
Boing!

18:34.679 --> 18:37.807
What on God's green earth
are you making those noises for?

18:37.883 --> 18:41.216
<i>They're sound effects,
like that guy on Police Academy.</i>

18:41.286 --> 18:43.914
That's what I'm gonna do when
I grow up, I've decided.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.253
And Dad can't say boo about it.

18:46.324 --> 18:50.124
<i>Bobby, a man from the Child
Protective Services just came by.</i>

18:50.829 --> 18:54.959
He said that he told you last week
that this investigation was off.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.167
Please don't tell Dad!

18:59.471 --> 19:01.871
<i>Son, I have to. He's been worried.</i>

19:01.940 --> 19:04.841
- But I like him better this way.
- How come?

19:04.910 --> 19:07.811
I can make him love me
even when I screw up.

19:08.413 --> 19:10.313
Is that what you think?

19:13.618 --> 19:15.245
It's hard, Peggy.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.748
I don't want to lose my little boy,
my only son.

19:19.724 --> 19:21.214
But it's hard.

19:21.293 --> 19:22.783
Well, you can relax.

19:22.894 --> 19:25.658
The investigation has
been off for a week...

19:25.730 --> 19:27.630
only, Bobby didn't tell us.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.633
- I'll kill him!
- All right, calm down, honey.

19:29.701 --> 19:32.966
Now let me explain.
He didn't do it to be mean.

19:33.038 --> 19:35.973
Bobby honestly doesn't think
that you love him all the time.

19:36.041 --> 19:37.872
That's crazy. Of course I love him.

19:37.943 --> 19:40.036
Very good. Now, say it to Bobby.

19:40.111 --> 19:41.578
What are you talking about?

19:41.646 --> 19:45.639
I want you to tell Bobby that your
love for him is unconditional.

19:45.750 --> 19:48.116
I can't say that. I can't!

19:48.687 --> 19:52.214
You know how I was raised.
What my father's like.

19:52.290 --> 19:56.226
I got my shins blowed off by
a Japan man's machine gun!

19:56.628 --> 19:59.620
<i>So don't come crying to me
with your problems!</i>

20:00.865 --> 20:02.526
Honey, I'm begging you.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.195
For the sake of this family,
you have got to do it.

20:05.270 --> 20:07.602
He's waiting for you out on the porch.

20:07.672 --> 20:08.661
Jeez.

20:08.907 --> 20:11.432
Damn twig boy
comes over here...

20:16.548 --> 20:17.845
You...

20:18.617 --> 20:20.107
You're my son.

20:20.986 --> 20:23.181
Well, you know, with everything...

20:23.788 --> 20:25.415
that entails.

20:30.695 --> 20:31.684
You know...

20:31.896 --> 20:35.798
feelings of fondness and more...

20:37.235 --> 20:39.203
You know what I mean, don't you, boy?

20:39.704 --> 20:40.728
No.

20:42.340 --> 20:43.329
Well...

20:45.243 --> 20:48.337
That's a hell of a weird sound.
I never made that before.

20:49.247 --> 20:50.236
I...

20:50.715 --> 20:51.704
you...

20:53.084 --> 20:54.278
family.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.351
You're not making
this easy on me, boy.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.581
Okay.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.358
I love you no matter what you do.
There!

21:04.429 --> 21:06.659
Let's go get something to eat!

21:06.798 --> 21:07.856
I'm not...

21:08.700 --> 21:11.100
just a big disappointment to you?

21:11.169 --> 21:14.627
Disappointment? No. You make me proud.

21:15.073 --> 21:18.304
I've been disappointed by just about
everything else in this town.

21:18.376 --> 21:20.139
But you? Not once.

21:20.645 --> 21:22.510
Damn it, you're my boy.

21:23.048 --> 21:25.073
<i>You know better than that.</i>

21:26.451 --> 21:27.509
He punched him!

21:27.585 --> 21:29.780
<i>I knew it! I told them!
Did you see that?</i>

21:29.854 --> 21:31.583
<i>See what, twig boy?</i>

21:32.457 --> 21:33.788
<i>Never mind.</i>
