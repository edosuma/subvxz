(Car door slams)

00:03.172 --> 00:07.009
Johnny: So, this is the town limits?

00:07.043 --> 00:10.512
Ray: Yes sir, 4,500 acres that
ends right here at the town sign.

00:10.546 --> 00:13.415
And it's all yours, Johnny,
it must be a nice feeling,

00:13.449 --> 00:15.616
considering you don't have a lot right now.

00:15.651 --> 00:17.285
You know, because of the
crooked business manager.

00:17.319 --> 00:18.386
You know, the money scandal...

00:18.421 --> 00:20.855
Yes, I know, I know, I know, Ray.

00:23.325 --> 00:24.559
What the hell is this?!

00:24.593 --> 00:26.794
Ray: The town sign.

00:26.828 --> 00:29.430
Johnny: Is this the real
sign, or the joke sign?

00:29.464 --> 00:30.898
Ray: What do you mean?

00:30.933 --> 00:33.467
Johnny: You don't see
anything wrong with this?

00:33.501 --> 00:35.603
The man!

00:35.637 --> 00:38.272
Standing awfully close to
that woman, wouldn't you say?

00:38.306 --> 00:40.575
Johnny: Well, he's holding on to her
so she doesn't fall into the creek.

00:40.609 --> 00:42.909
Johnny: Look a little closer, Ray.

00:42.944 --> 00:45.312
Ray: Well, it need a little sprucing up.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.114
- Johnny: Sprucing up?!
- Ray: It's very popular,

00:47.148 --> 00:48.715
people come from all over
to take a picture with it.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.417
Johnny: I'll bet they do!

00:50.452 --> 00:53.220
You know what? This is coming down!

00:53.254 --> 00:54.854
Ray: That's the mayor's family up there!

00:54.889 --> 00:57.124
The sign's been here over forty years.

00:57.158 --> 01:01.327
Johnny: And you wonder
why this place won't sell?

01:01.361 --> 01:04.864
Oh, I think I see it now.
His shoulders are too big.

(Door creaks open) Moira?

01:19.234 --> 01:21.202
Boy, we've got our work cut out for us.

01:21.236 --> 01:23.304
But I've seen worse.

01:23.338 --> 01:25.439
It's not a problem.

01:25.474 --> 01:27.475
Moira?

01:27.509 --> 01:30.711
<i>Moira: (Slurred) They
dare to call me irrelevant?</i>

01:33.114 --> 01:35.482
<i>Shag carpeting, that's irrelevant!</i>

01:37.852 --> 01:39.553
<i>L.A. is irrelevant... </i>

01:43.191 --> 01:46.326
<i>I am relevant!</i>

01:51.365 --> 01:54.201
"Good riddance," is what they said.

01:54.235 --> 01:55.669
Oh, who said that, sweetheart?

01:55.703 --> 01:58.672
<i>Moira: I don't know!</i>

01:58.706 --> 02:03.008
They're no name commentors.

02:03.009 --> 02:06.412
- Tormentors.
- Are we having a bad day, honey?

02:06.536 --> 02:08.770
Moira: Anonymous.

02:08.806 --> 02:12.408
Ominous.

02:12.442 --> 02:14.543
That'll be fine, thank you.

02:14.577 --> 02:19.849
I'm afraid I don't have
a gratuity right now.

02:19.883 --> 02:22.818
Alexis: So, that guy from the other night.

02:22.852 --> 02:25.253
- He's not for me, right?
- David: What guy?

02:25.288 --> 02:28.590
That beardy guy that I kissed at the party.

02:28.625 --> 02:31.694
He's gross, right? Like,
that's not a thing for me.

02:31.728 --> 02:34.898
There wasn't like, a spark or anything.

02:35.332 --> 02:37.665
You mean the hitchhiker that was
burning meat over a garbage can?

02:37.700 --> 02:39.868
Yeah, that one.

02:39.902 --> 02:42.003
Have you seen your mother today?

02:42.038 --> 02:43.438
Um yeah, she was face down on the carpet

02:43.472 --> 02:45.440
before dragging herself into the closet.

02:45.474 --> 02:47.742
And you didn't say anything?!

02:47.776 --> 02:50.578
I thought she was maybe looking
for a contact or something.

02:50.612 --> 02:52.180
Johnny: Yeah, she googled herself again,

02:52.215 --> 02:55.149
now she's having one of her "things."

02:55.183 --> 02:56.684
How bad is it?

02:56.719 --> 02:58.653
Johnny: How bad is it? A solid seven.

02:58.687 --> 03:00.888
It's not an eight, which
seems manageable for you.

03:00.922 --> 03:02.724
Johnny: Well, except I've got a
few things I have to take care of,

03:02.758 --> 03:04.559
so I need you two to go in, and take...

03:04.593 --> 03:06.761
No, I did Saint-Tropez, so.

03:06.795 --> 03:09.230
David: And I did her
birthday, and Aspen twice.

03:09.264 --> 03:10.931
Johnny: And I'm trying to sell this town.

03:10.966 --> 03:14.034
So, if you kids want any
chance of getting out of here,

03:14.069 --> 03:16.436
you'll help me out, and go
in and look after your mother!

03:16.471 --> 03:18.339
Well, my horoscope said
that I shouldn't assume

03:18.373 --> 03:20.474
responsibility for
anybody but myself today.

03:20.508 --> 03:21.942
Johnny: Yeah, and my horoscope says,

03:21.977 --> 03:26.313
why don't you go in and help your mother!

03:26.348 --> 03:27.814
And don't let her out of your sight, okay?

03:27.849 --> 03:29.182
We don't want her detonating in public!

03:29.716 --> 03:31.818
Alexis: I know!

03:31.853 --> 03:34.654
Though it is kind of fun to watch, though.

03:34.689 --> 03:36.390
Not when you're the one she's
trying to back over with a car.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.392
What's that?

03:38.426 --> 03:40.026
- David: Eye cream.
- Johnny: From where?

03:40.060 --> 03:41.561
David: From Paris.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.496
How did you pay for it?

03:43.530 --> 03:45.431
David: Oh, one of my credit
cards is still working.

03:45.465 --> 03:47.233
Johnny: Oh, you're charging
things to your credit card?!

03:47.268 --> 03:50.136
I see, and how are you gonna pay for it?

03:50.170 --> 03:54.908
David: I don't think you
understand, I already have it.

03:54.942 --> 03:57.810
Well, I know this is a
bizarre concept for you, David,

03:57.844 --> 04:01.013
<i>but if you want cream
from Paris, you need a job,</i>

04:01.047 --> 04:04.850
so you can pay for the cream from Paris!

04:04.885 --> 04:07.586
Okay well, tell that to the
bags under my eyes, then.

04:07.621 --> 04:09.254
Johnny: And right after
you tell your next joke,

04:09.289 --> 04:10.656
I want you to go down to the front desk,

04:10.690 --> 04:11.824
and ask what's-her-name...

04:11.858 --> 04:13.026
Stevie.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.695
Johnny: Where you can get a
job around here! All right?

04:15.729 --> 04:17.896
I'm in the middle getting
rid of an x-rated sign,

04:17.930 --> 04:20.699
before it scares off the few
buyers we might actually have!

04:20.733 --> 04:23.668
Okay, I'll get on that.

04:23.703 --> 04:26.839
Johnny: You want the smooth under
eyes of a 16-year-old, get a job!

04:29.175 --> 04:30.909
<i>(Door slams)</i>

04:30.944 --> 04:33.077
You just need to relax, because
it's not like your boyfriend left you

04:33.111 --> 04:35.980
for a Scandinavian flight attendant!

04:36.014 --> 04:38.850
What kind of name is Kika anyway?

04:38.884 --> 04:40.485
I'm the one that should be in
the closet right now, not you.

04:40.519 --> 04:42.620
Moira: Help me out.

04:42.655 --> 04:44.456
- Moira: Help me!
- Alexis: Okay!

04:44.490 --> 04:47.892
- Moira: Oh, shhh!
- My foot's fallen asleep.

04:47.926 --> 04:51.128
Hey, shall we see what they're
saying about you and Stavros?

04:51.163 --> 04:54.598
Alexis: No! Moira: It's not my idea!

04:54.632 --> 04:56.667
Moira: You were a couple of doe eyed lovers

04:56.701 --> 05:01.339
aboard a trans-Atlantic
airship filled with gas!

05:01.373 --> 05:02.473
Alexis: You know what I think we should do?

05:02.507 --> 05:04.275
I think we should go get something to eat,

05:04.309 --> 05:07.043
because when you're eating you
can't be talking to me, okay?

05:07.078 --> 05:08.846
- Moira: You know what I think?
- Alexis: What?

05:08.880 --> 05:11.248
(Snorts like a pig)

05:11.282 --> 05:14.818
You date pigs.

05:14.853 --> 05:17.755
Okay, I just remembered that being
a mother is not your strong suit.

05:17.789 --> 05:22.292
Oh darling, I'm only telling
you because it's true!

05:22.326 --> 05:23.559
Alexis: And because you
gobbled down a hundred thousand

05:23.594 --> 05:25.561
anti-depressants this morning.

05:25.596 --> 05:29.599
Moira: I was hungry! But I could still eat.

05:29.633 --> 05:30.500
(Stapler clicks)

05:35.439 --> 05:37.774
David: Hi, um... question.

05:37.808 --> 05:42.845
If one were to theoretically look for a job

05:42.880 --> 05:46.749
here in Schitt's Creek, where would you...

05:46.784 --> 05:49.819
suggest that that person go to look?

05:49.853 --> 05:52.187
Is there, like, a bulletin
board or a pamphlet,

05:52.222 --> 05:53.689
or something with information on it?

05:53.724 --> 05:55.958
Stevie: No, no bulletin board...

05:55.992 --> 05:58.294
What kind of job are you looking for?

05:58.328 --> 06:01.530
David: Um, something in like, art
curating, or trend forecasting.

06:01.564 --> 06:04.733
Stevie: Oh, okay... um, hmmm, let's see.

06:04.767 --> 06:07.569
Not seeing anything in art curating,

06:07.603 --> 06:09.838
or trend forecasting, that's weird.

06:09.872 --> 06:11.673
David: Okay.

06:11.757 --> 06:14.158
Um, do you have any other
skills or areas of expertise?

06:14.193 --> 06:16.260
I've been told I have really good taste.

06:16.355 --> 06:17.856
Oh, well, that's good.

06:17.890 --> 06:21.026
Um, let's see... Oh!

06:21.060 --> 06:23.762
Bag boy at the grocery store.

06:23.796 --> 06:25.096
I don't know what that is.

06:25.130 --> 06:27.465
You put groceries in bags,

06:27.499 --> 06:28.832
so that people can carry their groceries

06:28.867 --> 06:31.969
out of the grocery store.

06:32.003 --> 06:35.206
Okay, and how much do
you think that would pay?

06:35.240 --> 06:38.809
Mmm, I'm gonna say minimum wage.

06:38.843 --> 06:41.212
Johnny: Which is what, forty,
forty-five something an hour?

06:41.246 --> 06:44.915
- Mmm-hmm, exactly.
- David: Okay. Okay!

06:44.950 --> 06:46.283
Um, well, something to think about.

06:46.317 --> 06:48.318
For sure, thank you.

06:48.352 --> 06:51.655
Stevie: You're welcome.

06:51.690 --> 06:55.993
Moira: I would like two apple fritters,

06:56.027 --> 06:59.229
sliver of pecan pie, large
fries with gravy and bacon!

07:01.999 --> 07:04.434
Alexis: Okay, so, she will
have scrambled egg whites

07:04.469 --> 07:06.470
and some steamed spinach,
please, thank you.

07:06.504 --> 07:10.773
Moira: And some pecan pie!
Onion rings, and ice cream!

07:10.808 --> 07:12.809
Actually, none of that, and
I will have a tea, thank you.

07:12.843 --> 07:15.245
Okay.

07:15.279 --> 07:18.514
Um, Mrs. Rose, are you
okay? You seem a bit...

07:18.548 --> 07:21.718
- Alexis: Mm-hmm, she's fine.
- Moira: I'm fine.

07:48.612 --> 07:50.279
Hey! Hey! Hey you! Hey!

07:52.281 --> 07:54.382
Hey, so I just wanted to be clear

07:54.416 --> 07:56.051
about what happened the other night.

07:56.085 --> 07:57.719
The reason that I let you kiss me.

07:57.754 --> 08:00.488
Um, you kissed me.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.357
Yeah, no, I can see how
that would be confusing,

08:02.391 --> 08:04.592
but I just wanted to let you know

08:04.627 --> 08:08.095
that that was just me
going through some stuff.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.764
Cool.

08:09.798 --> 08:11.899
Um, hey!

08:11.933 --> 08:15.036
So, why do they give you table scraps?

08:15.070 --> 08:17.071
Are you, like, a poor person, or?

08:19.208 --> 08:21.442
Uh, no, but thanks for asking.

08:21.477 --> 08:23.444
No, I use it to compost.

08:23.479 --> 08:26.313
You know, that way nothing gets thrown out.

08:26.347 --> 08:28.315
Composting?

08:28.349 --> 08:31.085
Yeah, no, I... I know composting.

08:31.119 --> 08:35.089
Um, Gwyneth Paltrow does
a compost gift exchange.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.792
I'm gonna go.

08:37.826 --> 08:40.727

that we could clear this up.

08:54.342 --> 08:56.009
Good morning.

- Ray! Hi.
- Ray: Hi.

08:59.346 --> 09:00.914
Johnny: I... I just stopped
by to make an appointment

09:00.948 --> 09:02.882
to see the town council.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.784
<i>Bob: You're looking at us.</i>

09:04.819 --> 09:07.987
I'm Bob, that's Ronnie, you know Ray.

09:08.022 --> 09:09.555
Johnny: Yes, yes, Ray.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.225
Spent a wonderful morning with Ray.

09:12.259 --> 09:14.493
Well, I can see you've got a
million things on your plate,

09:14.528 --> 09:17.496
so I'll get to the point,
it's about the town sign.

09:17.531 --> 09:19.031
I told you he wouldn't let this go!

09:19.065 --> 09:21.200
(Ray and Bob chuckle)

09:21.235 --> 09:24.670
The sign tells people what to
expect when they're in town.

09:24.705 --> 09:27.072
Do you have a problem with that message?

09:27.107 --> 09:29.775
A major problem, Bob.

09:29.809 --> 09:32.010
Yeah, you see, it's the first
thing you see when you drive in,

09:32.045 --> 09:34.412
<i>and as the owner of the town,</i>

09:34.447 --> 09:38.851
I'd like to convey a better, cleaner image.

09:38.885 --> 09:41.153
There's a lot of history
in that sign, Johnny.

09:41.243 --> 09:43.077
Schitt history.

09:43.112 --> 09:45.213
<i>Ronnie: That's all we need,</i>

09:45.247 --> 09:47.748
some outsider coming in
here and changing everything.

09:47.783 --> 09:50.651
If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

09:53.655 --> 09:55.155

09:58.092 --> 09:59.827
- Hello, Moira!
- Moira: (Gasps) Hi!

10:02.597 --> 10:03.897
How are you?

10:03.932 --> 10:07.301
I'm eating egg whites,

10:07.335 --> 10:10.437
and hoping the building will collapse.

10:10.471 --> 10:12.739
Anyways, I have a giant favour.

10:15.810 --> 10:20.380
My class is putting on a play for
the younger grades, and I just...

10:20.414 --> 10:23.015
thought that you'd be perfect,

10:23.050 --> 10:25.454
you know, to help coach the kids.

10:27.488 --> 10:30.390
Because they'd be thrilled
to have someone like you,

10:30.424 --> 10:36.622
an actual star... teach them?

10:37.597 --> 10:40.499
That must have taken such
courage to ask me that.

10:44.838 --> 10:48.140
But in show business boldness is rewarded,

10:48.175 --> 10:50.042
so my answer is yes.

10:50.077 --> 10:52.811
Yes, yes!

10:52.846 --> 10:55.746
- That is such good news!
- (Bleep), I know!

11:05.045 --> 11:07.813
So, how'd it go?

11:07.848 --> 11:10.682
I met with a woman at a
very sad grocery store,

11:10.716 --> 11:14.753
and I have a quote unquote
interview to be a bag boy.

11:14.787 --> 11:18.023
Johnny: Hey, that's great!

11:18.058 --> 11:20.359
David: That's all that I'm
apparently qualified to be.

11:20.393 --> 11:21.393
When's the interview?

11:21.428 --> 11:22.961
This afternoon.

11:22.995 --> 11:24.696
Well, the interview's where you make

11:24.730 --> 11:25.964
your first good impression,
so, it's gotta count.

11:25.998 --> 11:27.365
I'm interviewing to be a bag boy,

11:27.399 --> 11:29.167
not a personal injury lawyer.

11:29.201 --> 11:32.236
David, I've had enough people
hire enough people in my day

11:32.271 --> 11:34.539
to know exactly what they're
looking for in an interview,

11:34.574 --> 11:36.975
so, let's go! Let's get up.

11:37.109 --> 11:38.877
(Claps)

11:38.911 --> 11:40.679
For what?

11:40.713 --> 11:42.413
<i>(Knocking)</i>

11:42.447 --> 11:43.714
Come in!

11:46.518 --> 11:50.054
Ah, David Rose.

11:50.088 --> 11:52.089
You're applying for the bag boy position.

11:52.123 --> 11:53.624
David: Yeah.

11:53.659 --> 11:55.759
Johnny: Tell me David,
why do you want this job?

11:55.794 --> 11:57.662
I don't want this job.

11:57.696 --> 12:00.463
Well, thank you very much,
and don't expect a phone call!

12:00.498 --> 12:01.932
- David: Okay.
- Johnny: All right, do it right!

12:01.966 --> 12:03.567
Or let's not do it.

12:03.601 --> 12:05.669
Now, we're gonna start again.

12:05.704 --> 12:07.604
- David: Okay.
- Johnny: Tell me, David, why do you want this job?

12:07.638 --> 12:09.573
I ran out of eye cream.

12:09.607 --> 12:10.674
Okay, you're not gonna get this job.

12:10.709 --> 12:12.009
You're not gonna get this job!

12:12.043 --> 12:14.511
You know why? Your attitude sucks!

12:14.545 --> 12:15.778
- David: Okay...
- Johnny: And look at how you're dressed!

12:15.813 --> 12:18.715
Johnny: What is this?! Colostomy bag pants!

12:18.749 --> 12:20.450
I'm the manager of a
family run grocery store.

12:20.484 --> 12:22.619
I'm not gonna hire you!

12:22.653 --> 12:24.987
You're not gonna get the
job, you're the last person...

12:25.022 --> 12:26.623
- David: Okay!
- Johnny: Where's your mother?

12:26.657 --> 12:28.157
Alexis: Whew!

12:28.192 --> 12:30.126
- Where's your mother?
- Alexis: What?

12:30.160 --> 12:32.128
- Aaaaaah!
- Alexis: Aaah? What?!

12:32.162 --> 12:34.363
- Johnny: Where's your mother?!
- Alexis: She's with Jocelyn.

12:34.397 --> 12:36.699
<i>- Johnny: With Jocelyn?
- Alexis: She's fine!</i>

12:36.734 --> 12:37.967
And I'm fine too, if anybody cares.

12:38.001 --> 12:39.902
I told you to watch her!

12:39.937 --> 12:41.104
Alexis: I did watch her!

12:41.138 --> 12:43.372
I watched her talk to Jocelyn.

12:43.406 --> 12:46.475
(Sighs deeply)

12:46.545 --> 12:50.181
<i>Moira: Okay, how many of
you beautiful young things</i>

12:50.215 --> 12:51.316
have a background in the theater?

12:51.350 --> 12:53.184
Raise your swords!

12:57.189 --> 13:01.359
I see, a class grounded
in realism, nice work.

13:01.394 --> 13:03.127
Because that is where
we find our deepest well.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.397
May I be up front?

13:06.431 --> 13:09.466
Jocelyn: Yes.

13:09.501 --> 13:11.803
We're not here to play, or to have fun!

13:15.073 --> 13:17.141
You will work until it hurts!

13:20.679 --> 13:22.713
(Horn honks)

13:22.747 --> 13:24.881
Hey, come here a second!

13:24.916 --> 13:27.618
Hey, just the man I wanna see!

13:27.652 --> 13:30.253
So word on the street is
that you're all freaked out

13:30.288 --> 13:33.056
about the town sign, is that right?

13:33.090 --> 13:35.492
No, no, I'm not freaked out
about the town sign, I just...

13:35.527 --> 13:38.962
And that you have some sort
of problem with my family,

13:38.996 --> 13:40.463
- Roland: ... Or something, is that it?!
- Johnny: No, no, no, this is not about your family.

13:40.497 --> 13:42.098
- Roland: Oh, it's not?
- Johnny: It's not about your family.

13:42.133 --> 13:42.665
- Roland: Oh, really? Okay, interesting.
- Johnny: No, no, no.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.301
In the car, come on!

13:44.335 --> 13:48.471
In, let's go!

13:48.505 --> 13:50.841
Come on, Kaylee, try this.

13:50.875 --> 13:53.543
<i>It's cool.</i>

13:53.577 --> 13:55.345
Tiffany: I can be cool without drugs, Mark!

13:55.379 --> 13:56.546
Moira: Okay, stop! No one speak.

13:56.580 --> 13:59.114
Not a word!

13:59.149 --> 14:01.551
(Wordless grunting)

14:01.585 --> 14:03.786
It's not your fault, the script is garbage!

14:03.821 --> 14:05.788
Okay, which one of you wrote this?

14:08.325 --> 14:11.827
Jocelyn: I did.

14:11.862 --> 14:14.230
Jocelyn, have you ever
been addicted to drugs?

14:14.264 --> 14:16.565
No!

14:16.599 --> 14:18.667
Then write what you know, okay?

14:18.701 --> 14:20.535
The quiet suffering of a woman

14:20.570 --> 14:22.571
trapped in a relationship with a simpleton.

14:22.605 --> 14:25.440
That's not what I know Moira,

14:25.475 --> 14:28.943
and drug awareness is
part of the curriculum, so.

14:28.978 --> 14:31.212
I'm gonna work with these two.

14:31.247 --> 14:34.416
<i>What is it that you want?</i>

14:34.450 --> 14:36.017
To go home.

14:36.051 --> 14:37.619
Is that where you keep the stash?

14:37.653 --> 14:39.621
You want the marijuana?

14:39.655 --> 14:41.623
Yes?

14:41.657 --> 14:44.625
Moira: No, you want to be
seen, and heard, and loved!

14:46.862 --> 14:48.263
Now, what is it you need?

14:51.433 --> 14:54.202
It's different, be careful,
what is it you need?

14:56.571 --> 14:58.773
(Shouting) What is it you need?

15:01.009 --> 15:02.676
<i>(Birds chirp)</i>

15:02.711 --> 15:09.216
â™ª

15:16.057 --> 15:18.091
Okay. Ahem!

15:18.126 --> 15:19.526
(Knocking)

15:22.330 --> 15:24.031
(Door creaks)

15:26.834 --> 15:29.169
Hey!

15:29.203 --> 15:32.172
Um, were you working
out or something? Or...

15:32.206 --> 15:35.508
Ah, sort of.

15:35.543 --> 15:38.711
Okay, well, I'm sorry for interrupting.

15:38.746 --> 15:41.180
Um, I just I happened
to be in the area, so...

15:41.214 --> 15:43.950
<i>Twyla: Mutt?</i>

15:43.984 --> 15:46.319
Mutt: Um... just...

15:46.353 --> 15:48.721
Alexis!

15:48.756 --> 15:51.290
Twyla! (Laughs falsely)

15:51.325 --> 15:52.558
I didn't know you two were uh...

15:52.592 --> 15:54.327
Did you wanna come in?

15:54.361 --> 15:55.828
I was just about to make some tea.

15:55.862 --> 15:58.331
Alexis: Mmm, no, I'm good.

15:58.365 --> 16:00.766
Uh, I should be getting back to my mom,

16:00.800 --> 16:03.836
who's not well, yeah, so, I'm gonna go.

16:03.870 --> 16:04.803
- Mutt: Okay.
- Twyla: Oh.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.105
You guys have fun!

16:06.139 --> 16:07.739
Thanks!

16:07.774 --> 16:11.176
(Alexis laughs hollowly) Alexis: Bye!

16:11.210 --> 16:14.880
Blaaaaah!

16:14.914 --> 16:18.484
Roland: That is my great
grandfather up there, Horace Schitt.

16:18.518 --> 16:21.186
He was a visionary, Johnny!

16:21.220 --> 16:23.488
He discovered this land, he developed it,

16:23.522 --> 16:26.057
and he turned it into the little
slice of heaven that it is.

16:26.092 --> 16:28.759
And I'm proud of him! You understand that?

16:28.794 --> 16:29.560
Roland, you've got this all wrong.

16:29.595 --> 16:31.596
Why do you hate me?

16:31.630 --> 16:33.365
I don't hate you! I don't hate you!

16:33.399 --> 16:34.366
Well then, why do you
have a problem with a sign

16:34.400 --> 16:36.434
that celebrates my family?

16:36.469 --> 16:38.870
It's not, it's just the way
they're celebrating, that's all!

16:38.904 --> 16:40.571
Roland: Okay, so now you hate my family.

16:40.606 --> 16:42.540
Johnny: I don't hate your family!

16:42.574 --> 16:44.375
Roland: Well then, what is your
big fat problem with the sign?!

16:44.409 --> 16:46.076
Johnny: It looks like your
great grandfather's (Bleep)

16:46.111 --> 16:50.247
your great grandmother right up the ass!

16:50.281 --> 16:53.217
Oh my go... that is so demented!

16:53.251 --> 16:56.453
You can't tell me you don't see that!

16:56.488 --> 16:59.390
Well, you know, now that you put
that creepy thought in my head,

16:59.424 --> 17:02.959
sure, I... I see it, but
you got it all wrong, pal!

17:02.994 --> 17:05.229
Let me enlighten you, Mr. Johnny Rose!

17:05.262 --> 17:07.364
That isn't even Horace's wife!

17:07.398 --> 17:09.598
<i>That's his sister.</i>

17:12.503 --> 17:14.604
Well, how does that make it any better?

17:14.638 --> 17:16.673
Ohhh!

17:16.707 --> 17:18.842
Well, I don't know how they
do things where you come from,

17:18.876 --> 17:20.510
but around these parts,

17:20.545 --> 17:23.346
we don't do that sort of
thing with our sisters!

17:23.380 --> 17:26.782
Roland, how is anybody
driving past this sign

17:26.817 --> 17:28.885
supposed to know the woman
getting banged from behind

17:28.920 --> 17:31.421
is that man's sister?!

17:31.756 --> 17:35.491
- Roland: Oh my.
- Johnny: Oh my! Yes, oh my!

17:35.526 --> 17:37.593
All right, Johnny, well I never
really looked at it that way,

17:37.627 --> 17:39.495
but now I get it, okay,

17:39.530 --> 17:41.064
well, all right, I'll
do something about it,

17:41.098 --> 17:43.199
I'll fix it, all right?

17:43.233 --> 17:45.535
And thank you, thank you
for bringing that up to me.

17:45.569 --> 17:48.971
Johnny: Good.

17:49.005 --> 17:51.173
Good!

17:51.207 --> 17:54.944
Jocelyn, we're going off book!

17:54.978 --> 17:56.211
Jocelyn: Well, actually,
we're running out of time.

17:56.245 --> 17:59.014
Forget the lines, forget the lines!

17:59.049 --> 18:01.116
Let's just be in character, shall we?

18:03.752 --> 18:05.520
Oh, could you be stiffer?!

18:05.555 --> 18:07.255
Just watch, please.

18:07.290 --> 18:08.557
Ahem! Start wherever.

18:08.671 --> 18:12.274
Um... Do you wanna smoke a joint?

18:12.308 --> 18:15.410
Oh Mark, you are better than this.

18:15.444 --> 18:17.379
You can't let others define you.

18:17.413 --> 18:19.113
Look at me!

18:19.148 --> 18:21.949
Never let the bastards get you down!

18:21.984 --> 18:24.251
- (Whispering) Can't say bastard!
- Okay.

18:24.286 --> 18:25.887
You must prepare for life,

18:25.921 --> 18:27.722
and whatever it will throw at you.

18:27.756 --> 18:30.091
The opportunities will diminish,

18:30.125 --> 18:32.293
and the ass will get bigger,

18:32.327 --> 18:34.028
oh, you can bet your bottom dollar it will!

18:34.063 --> 18:35.629
Especially yours.

18:35.664 --> 18:37.998
You're going to have a huge ass.

18:38.032 --> 18:40.934
<i>And you, future baldy.</i>

18:40.968 --> 18:43.571
Sorry, hairless, homeless!

18:43.605 --> 18:46.039
<i>So what? Who cares?</i>

18:46.124 --> 18:49.360
When they get mean, you
tell them to go to hell!

18:49.394 --> 18:52.729
Because only you know who you are!

18:52.764 --> 18:55.031
And those cruel Internet people

18:55.066 --> 18:56.867
cannot take that away from you!

18:56.901 --> 19:00.270
You will forge on!

19:00.304 --> 19:04.540
And you will find some glimmer
of something to hold on to.

19:04.575 --> 19:08.544
And only then will you find your way back.

19:08.579 --> 19:11.481
Only then will you become
once again who you are!

19:13.284 --> 19:15.217
Lady standing!

19:17.053 --> 19:20.657
(Sobs)

19:20.691 --> 19:21.957
(Groans)

19:26.362 --> 19:28.831
Good, you're gettin' the hang of it.

19:28.865 --> 19:31.066
David: Well, putting groceries in a bag

19:31.101 --> 19:33.135
is not as complicated as one might think.

19:33.170 --> 19:35.537
Store manager: Watch
the eggs. What did I say?

19:35.571 --> 19:37.606
David: You said put them in a separate bag.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.110
Store manager: Good. Quick learner.

19:41.144 --> 19:45.013

19:45.047 --> 19:48.016
David: Sorry, I just gotta...
just one... thank you.

19:50.085 --> 19:51.586
Hello?

19:51.621 --> 19:53.121
Hey, how's it going?

19:53.155 --> 19:54.823
Yeah, I can't talk right now, so.

19:54.857 --> 19:56.625
Johnny: Ah, they're working you hard, huh?

19:56.659 --> 20:00.862
Yeah, I can't talk, so
I'm gonna hang up, bye.

20:00.896 --> 20:02.230
Sorry, sorry about that.

20:07.069 --> 20:08.769
Someone's on a health kick, huh?

20:11.040 --> 20:13.474
<i>Woman on P.A.: David Rose, line one.</i>

20:15.610 --> 20:18.145
I'm just gonna... scoot past.

20:21.383 --> 20:23.083
- Yeah?
- Johnny: You hung up.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.621
Sorry.

20:27.656 --> 20:30.224
Okay.

20:30.258 --> 20:32.893
Where were we?

20:32.927 --> 20:35.062
<i>Woman on P.A.: (Annoyed)
David Rose, line one!</i>

20:37.298 --> 20:40.234
Right.

20:40.268 --> 20:42.469
Take that off.

20:42.503 --> 20:44.872
Hand that to you.

20:44.906 --> 20:45.973
Now I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

20:52.248 --> 20:55.583
This is worse. This is much worse!

20:55.618 --> 20:59.119
- David: You did this?
- Johnny: No, I didn't do this, I tried to fix this!

20:59.283 --> 21:02.685
Well, it... it is what it is.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.420
Okay, it looks like...

21:04.455 --> 21:06.055

21:06.089 --> 21:08.057
I know!
