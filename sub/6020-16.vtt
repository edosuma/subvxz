00:03.371 --> 00:04.733
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:04.872 --> 00:07.099
I hope you don't mind
baking-soda flavor.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.300
Baking soda,
annoying little product.

00:09.377 --> 00:12.969
"I can do this, I can do that."
Why doesn't the stuff just shut up?

00:13.147 --> 00:14.407
Let me grab you a towel.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:50.384 --> 00:53.214
- So?
- So? She used the toothbrush.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.947
- You grabbed it out of there real fast?
- Yeah.

00:56.023 --> 00:58.683
So I'm sure whatever germs
it landed on were knocked out.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.724
When the rest realized
what was going on...

01:00.795 --> 01:02.487
you had already grabbed it out.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.631
How many years of med school
did you have?

01:04.699 --> 01:06.061
Was she mad?

01:08.069 --> 01:10.729
- You didn't tell her.
- Jenna's like me. She's very....

01:10.872 --> 01:14.533
Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?

01:14.609 --> 01:16.006
I'll take "fastidious."

01:17.378 --> 01:18.740
What is that?

01:20.348 --> 01:21.881
Steinbrenner gave them to us.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.415
For Phil Rizzuto's
induction to the Hall of Fame.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.382
Holy cow.

01:27.755 --> 01:31.052
Do they have to squeeze his head
to get him to say "Holy cow"?

01:31.626 --> 01:33.990
Just the last few innings
of a double-header.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.992
Hey.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.289
Look at this.

01:37.365 --> 01:40.161
I'm in the passing lane of
the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway...

01:40.234 --> 01:42.734
going 70, and:

01:44.805 --> 01:47.669
Dragged this thing for five exits.

01:47.742 --> 01:49.241
Why didn't you pull over?

01:49.310 --> 01:52.709
Well, I was drafting behind a semi.
I didn't wanna lose him.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.781
The infrastructure, Jerry,
it's crumbling.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.612
Holy cow.

01:58.052 --> 02:01.610
Oh, look at that. Talking Nixon.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.685
- China Panda.
- Yeah, I'd like to place an order.

02:06.761 --> 02:08.055
Yes, what you like?

02:08.295 --> 02:11.763
This supreme flounder, it says
"First time served in America."

02:11.832 --> 02:13.695
- Is that true?
- What number?

02:13.768 --> 02:17.269
- Forty-seven?
- Yeah, first time. What else?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.770
- That's it.
- Address.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.535
78 West 86th Street, apartment 3E.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.908
That's south side.
Sorry, we don't deliver below 86.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.379
- I'm not below.
- Yes, you are.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.986
- Street itself is boundary.
- Your guy can't cross to my side?

02:33.054 --> 02:35.019
If we deliver to you, then what?

02:35.089 --> 02:38.750
85th Street? Wall Street?
Mexico? 84th Street?

02:38.826 --> 02:42.157
All right, fine.
I'll just cross and meet him.

02:42.229 --> 02:45.787
Sorry. Food only for those
who live within boundary.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.809
- China Panda.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.501
I'd like to place an order.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.146
What you like?

03:05.086 --> 03:07.177
Well, I'm a papa.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.648
Bring it on.
Nothing's throwing me at this point.

03:09.724 --> 03:11.849
Well, as of today,
I am a proud parent...

03:11.926 --> 03:14.859
of a one-mile stretch
of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.

03:14.929 --> 03:18.465
- Oh, that Adopt-A-Highway thing.
- I'm part of the solution now, Jerry.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.299
I went down there
and I checked it out this morning.

03:21.369 --> 03:25.599
- Here, take a look. Mile 114.
- Oh, looks just like you.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.001
Oh, I'm beaming, Jerry.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.304
What do you do?
Pay to keep it clean?

03:29.377 --> 03:32.037
No. They try to push you into
using their cleaning crew...

03:32.113 --> 03:34.545
with all their so-called
maintenance equipment.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.206
- That old scam.
- That's why I'm doing it all myself.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.818
This parenting isn't about
delegating responsibility...

03:39.887 --> 03:41.215
it's about being there.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.515
At the side of the road
with a pile of garbage.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.988
Quality time.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.728
- Keys. I can't find my keys.
- You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.123
- Have you seen him?
- No.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.193
- Damn it.
- Come on, retrace your steps.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.959
- What'd you do today?
- I got up...

03:55.036 --> 03:57.468
I was supposed to go to work,
I came here instead.

03:57.805 --> 04:00.339
They're not here.
You'll have to dig up your spare set.

04:00.408 --> 04:04.035
I don't have a spare set.
All my keys say "do not duplicate."

04:04.111 --> 04:08.079
- So?
- So you can't duplicate them.

04:08.816 --> 04:12.909
Sure you can. Such a sweet kid.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.896
Oh, hi. China Panda?

04:25.466 --> 04:28.558
Why are you waiting on the street
and not in your apartment?

04:28.636 --> 04:32.035
I thought that I would
meet you halfway.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.405
- Do you really live here?
- Oh, yeah.

04:35.476 --> 04:39.103
There you go. You keep the change.
Bye, now.

04:40.181 --> 04:42.272
I'll see you.

04:58.165 --> 05:02.929
You know, this isn't fair.
This is address discrimination.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.937
Well, I cleaned out their whole
dental-hygiene shelf.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.572
So the plan is to secretly
sterilize her mouth?

05:09.643 --> 05:12.678
When I'm through with her mouth,
she'll be able to eat off it.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.871
Is it safe to drink bleach
if you dilute it?

05:14.949 --> 05:17.984
No. Stings the throat. Anyway,
so I was coming along here.

05:18.252 --> 05:20.149
I felt like a piece of cake,
you know?

05:20.221 --> 05:23.222
So then I thought, "It's morning,
I should really have a muffin."

05:23.290 --> 05:24.857
I like those chocolate-chip ones.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.619
Then I figured, well,
they're really both cake.

05:27.695 --> 05:31.253
So I sat on that bench for a little while,
20 minutes or an hour...

05:31.332 --> 05:34.401
and then I figured I'd check
and see what you were up to.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.694
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The broad jump.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.966
The broad jump over the pothole
on 86th Street.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.706
I remember.
As I jumped over the hole...

05:44.778 --> 05:47.472
- I heard, like, a jingling sound.
- You didn't look down?

05:47.548 --> 05:51.709
I was trying to stick the landing.
I know it was right around here.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.781
No. No!

05:55.156 --> 05:57.656
Holy... Holy cow.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.824
Poor son of a bitch.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.520
It's 100,000 revolutions a second.

06:04.598 --> 06:08.828
- It's the most powerful one they make.
- I feel like I'm holding a blender.

06:08.903 --> 06:11.938
The engine's made
by McDonnell Douglas.

06:12.006 --> 06:14.540
No, no, you keep going.
It shuts off automatically.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.539
Really? It does?

06:16.610 --> 06:19.076
When the battery runs out.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.708
I was really happy
with my old toothbrush.

06:22.783 --> 06:26.512
Oh, trust me, that one was doing
more harm than good.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.653
Don't forget to use the Plax too.

06:32.226 --> 06:36.592
- That stuff tastes like bleach.
- I don't know anything about that.

06:39.567 --> 06:43.535
- My mouth feels so clean.
- That's the idea.

06:52.713 --> 06:56.010
You know, maybe we better not.
I think I'm getting a little cold.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.151
I don't wanna give you
any of my germs.

06:59.220 --> 07:02.483
Okay. Thanks, I guess.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.187
You still couldn't kiss her?

07:07.261 --> 07:10.353
She has a taint. I can't see it,
but I know it's there.

07:10.598 --> 07:14.156
Oh, so now you're finding fault
on a subatomic level.

07:14.235 --> 07:17.168
Maybe if I could shrink myself down,
like in Fantastic Voyage...

07:17.238 --> 07:20.034
and get inside a microscopic
submarine, I could be sure.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.074
Although if there was something there,
it might be pretty scary.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.575
Of course, I would have that laser.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.582
Jer, do you see where this is going?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.748
Being really clean and happy?

07:32.186 --> 07:35.414
Jerry, you have tendencies.

07:35.489 --> 07:39.320
They were always annoying,
but they were just tendencies.

07:39.393 --> 07:43.930
But now, if you can't kiss this girl,
I'm afraid we're talking disorder.

07:43.998 --> 07:46.066
- Disorder?
- And from disorder...

07:46.133 --> 07:50.932
you're a quirk or two away
from full-on dementia.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.597
That could hurt me.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.636
Hey, there it is.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.412
Should we stop and say hi?

08:00.481 --> 08:02.412
- No, we've seen it.
- Yeah.

08:03.017 --> 08:07.110
Hey, Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you
back at the house.

08:11.292 --> 08:15.351
Mile 114, clean as a whistle.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.514
- Yeah?
- Hi.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.155
I'm your neighbor...

08:44.391 --> 08:45.924
from across the street.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.353
And I was wondering if it wouldn't
be too much trouble...

08:50.431 --> 08:54.592
if I could use your apartment
to order some food.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.167
What? What do you want?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.236
You see, there's this
certain flounder...

08:58.305 --> 09:01.806
and they won't deliver it
to my side of the street.

09:02.076 --> 09:03.541
When is that?

09:04.378 --> 09:06.776
No, I just need them
to deliver it here...

09:06.847 --> 09:09.814
and I have to be
kind of inside, is all.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.280
Who are you with?

09:11.885 --> 09:15.682
No, actually, I'm just kind of hungry.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.950
- Who let you in?
- Well, the lock was broken.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.788
You just have to jiggle it,
actually, to get... But...

09:21.862 --> 09:25.363
I just need like half an hour
to an hour.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.245
What's with the signs?

09:40.314 --> 09:42.382
You should see the Berkhardt,
Jerry.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.074
My mile is spotless.
I mean, the big stuff was easy:

09:45.152 --> 09:48.312
Cinder blocks, air conditioners,
shopping carts.

09:48.389 --> 09:52.425
- I just rolled them into the woods.
- Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.

09:54.228 --> 09:57.388
Speed limit, 165 miles per hour.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.555
See? They slipped a one in there.

09:59.633 --> 10:03.692
Those kids with the spray paint,
God love them.

10:06.540 --> 10:07.732
Hey, so? Keys?

10:07.808 --> 10:10.308
No keys. And I've been
calling the city all day.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.741
There's no one to call
if you wanna make a pothole.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.040
I guess they leave that
to the general population.

10:15.349 --> 10:19.249
I'll tell you, if the real Phil Rizzuto was
down there this wouldn't be happening.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.445
- Hard to say.
- You need some roadwork done?

10:22.523 --> 10:24.784
I met some maintenance guys
today on the highway.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.983
- They could probably help you out.
- Really?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.094
Oh, yeah. I borrowed some cones
from them...

10:29.163 --> 10:31.959
when I was sweeping
my car-pool lane.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.932
- Yeah?
- It's Jenna.

10:34.701 --> 10:38.430
If you guys wouldn't mind,
I would like to ward off dementia.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.407
- You can hook me up with them?
- Yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.771
I'm gonna be
at emergency call box 784.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.537
Seven-eight-four.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.941
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.548
- How you feeling?
- Good.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.645
My cold's gone. I've been
looking forward to kissing you...

10:52.719 --> 10:55.617
which I'm ready to do now,
if you are ready.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.552
Okay.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.827
- What?
- Nothing, I just...

11:04.898 --> 11:07.091
I bruised my lip.
I was drinking a Cel-Ray...

11:07.167 --> 11:10.134
and I brought it up too fast
and I banged it into my lip.

11:10.204 --> 11:12.636
And then I knocked your toothbrush
into the toilet.

11:12.706 --> 11:15.240
And I wasn't able to tell you
before you could use it.

11:15.309 --> 11:17.343
- What?
- I'm sorry.

11:17.411 --> 11:20.446
- When were you gonna tell me this?
- Obviously never.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.348
I need the "yield" sign.

11:23.417 --> 11:26.918
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

11:26.987 --> 11:30.523
Would you get these signs
out of here, please?

11:32.192 --> 11:35.489
- You could have introduced me.
- I wouldn't know where to start.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.601
Hey. Jenna. Hey.

11:42.903 --> 11:46.769
There. Now something of yours
has been in the toilet.

11:46.974 --> 11:49.440
What? Well, what did you
put in there?

11:49.510 --> 11:51.475
Gotta run.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.546
Oh, man.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.152
Hello, Jenna?
Did you dunk the spatula?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.792
Was it the spatula? Hello?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.552
Damn it.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.194
Didn't even give you a hint?

12:11.265 --> 12:14.061
No, could be anything.
The whole apartment's a biohazard.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.033
You know what I bet it is?
Your remote.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.563
Yes, that is a definite possibility.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.071
Or it could be your Walkman there.

12:25.279 --> 12:27.813
- Are you just screwing with me?
- Yeah, I am.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.281
- Hey.
- How's life on the road?

12:31.351 --> 12:33.715
- I'm making a difference, Jerry.
- I don't doubt it.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.219
You should see the smiles
on the drivers' faces.

12:36.290 --> 12:38.722
I mean, you gotta look quick,
but they're there.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.884
- This.
- What's this?

12:40.961 --> 12:44.121
You know those annoying little bumps
on the lane lines?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.061
Isn't that some kind of safety thing?

12:48.135 --> 12:50.931
Well, I had to pull them up
if I'm gonna widen the lanes.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.530
What the hell are you talking about?

12:53.607 --> 12:56.767
Well, you know how in planes
they got first class?

12:56.843 --> 12:58.240
More legroom, better ride?

12:58.312 --> 13:01.108
Well, I'm bringing that concept
to mile 114.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.408
How are you gonna
widen the lanes?

13:03.483 --> 13:05.642
Well, you black out lane lines
one and three...

13:05.719 --> 13:10.085
and a four-lane highway
becomes a two-lane comfort cruise.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.622
So you got any black paint?

13:11.692 --> 13:14.590
Yeah, in my tool shed,
next to the riding mower.

13:14.661 --> 13:20.165
Yeah, I'd like an order
of supreme flounder, number 47.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.063
Yeah, apartment 1 Q.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.136
1 Q? Whose apartment is that?

13:25.205 --> 13:27.466
That's the janitor closet...

13:27.541 --> 13:29.575
across the street.

13:29.643 --> 13:33.110
You're pretending to live in a janitor's
closet just to get this flounder?

13:33.180 --> 13:37.614
It's better than eating it alone
in the restaurant like some loser.

13:38.852 --> 13:43.150
That stuff is unbelievable.
I'd eat it out of a dumpster.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.119
How do you know about it?
You're not in the delivery zone.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.726
Newman uses his mail truck...

13:47.794 --> 13:49.953
to run fish for China Panda
on the weekends.

13:50.030 --> 13:53.964
Well, mine's coming in 10,
so I'll see you boys.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.964
Now, where's that tool shed
of yours?

14:07.047 --> 14:10.310
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you.
I was in the shower.

14:11.485 --> 14:12.813
I'll see you.

14:15.756 --> 14:17.687
- You Costanza?
- Yeah.

14:17.758 --> 14:19.519
Thanks for coming by, fellas.

14:19.593 --> 14:23.652
Yeah, got a set of keys
buried in the pothole.

14:23.930 --> 14:28.023
- What are the keys doing in there?
- Just need to dig them up.

14:28.101 --> 14:31.967
- You put them in there?
- No, no. It's a long story.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.835
Just try to get it up.

14:34.908 --> 14:38.808
- Bad place to put your keys.
- Yeah, I know that.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.646
- Could you start working?
- Difficult job.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.445
If you want those keys,
we're gonna have to dig this up.

14:47.954 --> 14:52.013
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

14:52.092 --> 14:56.526
- Is this about money?
- Yeah, it's about money.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.379
Excuse me,
what are you doing in there?

15:17.784 --> 15:20.318
Nothing, I was just....

15:20.854 --> 15:22.387
I wasn't in there.

15:22.456 --> 15:25.821
You were hanging around in there,
lazing on the job...

15:25.892 --> 15:28.552
when you should have been
downstairs in the basement...

15:28.628 --> 15:30.889
cleaning out those old carpets
and scrap wood.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.726
Right, because...

15:34.501 --> 15:36.228
I'm the janitor.

15:36.303 --> 15:40.669
- Don't get smart with me.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.503
If you're heading north
on the Arthur Berkhardt...

15:45.579 --> 15:47.112
whoa, Nellie. For some reason...

15:47.180 --> 15:49.805
four lanes are converging into two
instantaneously...

15:49.883 --> 15:51.575
right at mile marker 114.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.811
I don't know what that is, but
the A.B.E. 's a parking lot out there.

15:54.888 --> 15:57.616
Somebody screwed up on that one.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.258
- Oh, it's you.
- Is the flounder here yet?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.958
No, it's not here yet.
You want the tour?

16:16.176 --> 16:17.971
There's this.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.478
Nice. French doors would
really open this place up.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.082
Oh, but you have a slop bucket.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.878
The fish.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.888
- What are you doing here?
- Hey.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.049
- Hey.
- Oh, I was...

16:34.127 --> 16:36.286
I was waiting downstairs
for the jackhammer.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.159
- I just thought I'd drop by.
- Kramer's guys?

16:39.232 --> 16:40.856
Yeah. I got them down to 50 bucks.

16:40.934 --> 16:42.968
I just have to do
all the jackhammering.

16:43.036 --> 16:46.537
Oh, that's nice, kind of
a hard-labor fantasy camp.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.612
Oh, yeah.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.510
Oh, sweet setup.

16:57.584 --> 17:01.313
Look, Elaine, do you have any
paint thinner? I need like 40 gallons.

17:01.955 --> 17:04.579
- I'm plumb out.
- Oh, damn.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.454
If I don't get that black paint off,
the city's gonna go ape.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.186
I don't wanna lose my baby.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.829
- Janitor.
- It's Mrs. Allister.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.797
Yeah. Yes, coming, Mrs. Allister.
Okay, I've gotta get out.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.928
Let's go. Let's go. Here. Can you...?
You gotta move from the door.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.444
Hi.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.505
I... What can I do for you?

17:29.583 --> 17:33.483
I told you yesterday to haul that trash
out of the basement.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.018
Yeah, I am so sorry.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.315
Some of the children
have been playing near it...

17:37.390 --> 17:38.957
and putting it in their mouth.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.953
Well, a lot of it is vegetables.

17:44.865 --> 17:46.796
You mop it.

17:48.702 --> 17:53.671
Get that stuff out of there today,
or you'll be out of here, understand?

17:53.974 --> 17:56.736
- Yes, ma'am.
- Stop pushing.

17:56.810 --> 18:00.471
- Kramer spilled ammonia.
- I don't feel like eating.

18:00.547 --> 18:03.081
I'm gonna borrow this, huh?

18:04.985 --> 18:07.349
Janitors' meeting.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.419
So, Jerry, why'd you call me?

18:11.491 --> 18:14.719
Well, I thought it's about time
we put aside all this silliness.

18:14.794 --> 18:18.625
I know now that you didn't put
anything in my toilet bowl.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.562
- Did you?
- Yes, I did.

18:21.635 --> 18:24.260
Well, whatever.
So how have you been?

18:24.337 --> 18:26.428
- Good.
- Good.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.632
Steak knife?

18:29.709 --> 18:32.277
- It's just eating away at you, isn't it?
- No.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.674
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:34.748 --> 18:36.907
- Hi.
- Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?

18:36.983 --> 18:38.311
For what?

18:38.385 --> 18:40.578
I have to haul some dirty garbage
to the dump.

18:40.654 --> 18:43.780
Dirt? That's all right, because
there's nothing wrong with dirt.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.686
Well, actually, it's pretty grimy.

18:45.759 --> 18:48.919
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze,
whatever it is...

18:48.995 --> 18:54.089
you take that stuff and put it
right on my leather upholstery.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.395
Well, I don't know who you are,
but thanks for the car.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.436
- Sure. Bye.
- Bye.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.336
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.837
There, you see?
I just lent her my car...

19:05.912 --> 19:11.143
and she's gonna fill it
with all sorts of....

19:11.217 --> 19:13.785
All right! You win.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.285
That car was my last
germfree sanctuary.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.889
I slept there last night.

19:17.958 --> 19:21.118
Now, for the love of God, please,
what is it? What is it?

19:21.294 --> 19:25.023
- Toilet brush.
- Toilet brush.

19:26.366 --> 19:30.596
- All right. I can replace that.
- You wanna order dinner?

19:30.670 --> 19:34.262
Yeah. Let's go to your place.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.839
Because I threw out all my dishes.

19:55.829 --> 19:59.558
That's true.
But I'll tell you this much:

19:59.632 --> 20:03.361
I am never going to let some
silly hygienic mishap...

20:03.436 --> 20:07.836
get in the way of what could be a
meaningful, long-lasting relationship.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.677
Do you hear something?

20:19.419 --> 20:21.680
I don't know what that could be.

20:28.862 --> 20:31.430
Holy cow.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.530
Anyway, I'm a new man...

20:37.604 --> 20:39.968
and I'm looking towards the future.

20:40.040 --> 20:44.702
Clean, dirty, whatever.

20:51.317 --> 20:54.215
Holy cow.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.549
Have a nice life.

21:00.827 --> 21:04.920
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes.

21:04.998 --> 21:08.261
This is so luxurious.

21:09.803 --> 21:11.894
Yeah.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.944
Bugger.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.052
What the hell was that?

21:42.035 --> 21:44.103
Double bugger.

21:54.781 --> 21:57.714
Oh, the humanity!

22:08.027 --> 22:10.118
Hey, buddy.
What are you doing out here?

22:10.697 --> 22:13.129
Man, did you see that fireball?

22:16.903 --> 22:20.029
Hey, I gotta skedaddle.
You want a lift?

22:20.907 --> 22:22.599
Newman?

22:23.476 --> 22:25.271
Newman!

22:28.314 --> 22:30.939
All right, I'll meet you
at the coffee shop.
