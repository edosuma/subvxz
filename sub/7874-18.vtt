00:34.698 --> 00:38.035
You're aware of the serious nature
of the charges brought against you?

00:38.202 --> 00:41.121
- Yes, sir.
- All right, begin and speak loudly, please.

00:41.288 --> 00:42.498
This is for the record.

00:42.665 --> 00:45.000
Well, the whole thing started
on Friday the 10th.

00:45.167 --> 00:48.796
I got off work early so I could pick up
my son and his friends from school.

00:51.590 --> 00:55.760
Gym, where huge kids with pituitary
problems are pitted against the weak.

00:57.679 --> 00:59.222
What the...?

01:01.307 --> 01:04.936
I got you.
You have to go to tickle jail.

01:05.436 --> 01:09.148
Your bail is set at one gumdrop.

01:09.315 --> 01:13.444
What is this? What happened
to the Langley Falls Fighting Buffaloes?

01:13.611 --> 01:16.531
We're now
the Langley Falls Prancing Buffaloes.

01:18.449 --> 01:21.244
Could you fetch me the gym teacher
and two cups of coffee?

01:21.411 --> 01:23.788
- He'll want bourbon in his.
- I am the gym teacher.

01:23.955 --> 01:26.791
No, you're confused.
You're a home economics teacher.

01:26.958 --> 01:29.877
Now, scoot back in the fake kitchen
and sew something tasty.

01:30.044 --> 01:34.507
Silly boots. We're just finishing up
a game of Tickle Play.

01:35.258 --> 01:36.551
Hi, Dad.

01:36.718 --> 01:39.845
- Well, did my boy's team win at least?
- Oh, there's no winning.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.347
We don't like to foster
a competitive atmosphere.

01:42.514 --> 01:46.143
But we laugh a lot.
Now, everyone hug and share a secret.

01:47.477 --> 01:49.396
I'm afraid of moths.

01:49.563 --> 01:52.315
My therapist says I'm a bad kisser.

01:55.277 --> 01:58.572
What's happened to America?
Your whole generation has gone soft.

01:58.739 --> 02:01.366
How are you gonna become men
not tackling each other...

02:01.533 --> 02:02.826
...and ruining your knees?

02:02.993 --> 02:05.579
- But tickle play is fun.
- And easy.

02:07.456 --> 02:10.208
Plus, we get trophies just for playing.

02:10.375 --> 02:13.253
Life isn't fun or easy
or what the Asian kid said.

02:13.420 --> 02:14.629
It's tough and brutal.

02:14.796 --> 02:17.382
- Life sounds mean.
- Damn right.

02:17.549 --> 02:20.593
You don't get a trophy in life
just for showing up.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.928
- Glitter.
- No. No glitter.

02:23.095 --> 02:26.098
How do you expect to become men
if you never do anything hard?

02:26.265 --> 02:28.058
Simple. We'll get safe, easy jobs.

02:28.225 --> 02:30.770
We'll keep quiet
so we don't not ruffle any feathers.

02:30.936 --> 02:34.106
Our female friends will realise
we're the best they're gonna do...

02:34.273 --> 02:36.484
...and they'll browbeat us
into marrying them.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.152
And then we'll get cake.

02:40.738 --> 02:43.449
If I see one tear, fatty,
and I'm doing it again.

02:48.078 --> 02:51.624
Good, you're not busy.
I need somebody to talk to. I just...

02:51.790 --> 02:55.211
I just love her so much.

02:56.754 --> 02:58.964
- Who?
- The cashier at Booze Town.

02:59.131 --> 03:01.133
You have a crush
on the liquor-store girl?

03:01.300 --> 03:02.842
Oh, heavens, yes.

03:03.009 --> 03:05.094
I need you
to pretend to be my girlfriend...

03:05.261 --> 03:07.764
...so she'll get jealous
and want me for herself.

03:07.931 --> 03:11.142
- Roger, I'm not sure that'll...
- Hayley, you gotta help. You gotta.

03:11.309 --> 03:15.688
- Okay, I'll go there with you.
- God bless you, you're an angel.

03:15.855 --> 03:18.900
Now, go dress like a woman.
I have heels if you need to borrow.

03:19.734 --> 03:20.777
How's it coming, boys?

03:20.944 --> 03:23.196
Have you pummelled each other
into manhood yet?

03:23.363 --> 03:25.823
- I can't reach it.
- Don't get sun on me.

03:25.990 --> 03:28.993
What in the name of Red Grange
is going on here?

03:29.160 --> 03:32.872
Oh, we were pretending the football
was a panda egg.

03:33.039 --> 03:36.542
- But it rolled into the sun.
- There's melanoma out there, Mr. Smith.

03:36.709 --> 03:39.379
Moth. Moth.
It's gonna leave dust on me.

03:41.256 --> 03:44.175
Leave him. He's as good as dead.

03:44.341 --> 03:46.510
Boys, get out here. Now.

03:46.677 --> 03:49.721
The sun will bake you
to a leathern Willie Nelson crust.

03:49.888 --> 03:52.849
- But being outside is hard.
- That's the point.

03:53.016 --> 03:55.269
There are three rules of manhood:

03:55.435 --> 03:59.314
A man is tough, a man takes charge,
and a man never quits.

03:59.481 --> 04:02.109
Let's set the rules
to a soulful a cappella melody.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.361
<i>A man takes charge</i>

04:04.528 --> 04:05.821
<i>A man is tough</i>

04:05.988 --> 04:08.573
<i>A man is tough</i>

04:12.327 --> 04:14.454
There is she is, Hayley.
Let's do a walk-by.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.082
You got it, lover.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.459
God, baby, your back is so toned.

04:20.627 --> 04:23.171
Oh, my lats?
The electric can opener broke.

04:23.338 --> 04:25.298
I've been opening them manually.

04:25.465 --> 04:30.219
With these big, strong hands?
They make me feel so safe.

04:30.386 --> 04:33.389
- Thanks. Cans again.
- I'll tell you the cans I like.

04:34.390 --> 04:37.852
Oh, sassy hands.
Don't just get one cheek, girl.

04:38.019 --> 04:39.520
Other side.

04:42.189 --> 04:44.400
So do you think it worked?

04:44.567 --> 04:46.152
Something worked.

04:46.318 --> 04:51.574
Hayley, I'm no longer in love
with the booze girl. I'm in love with you.

04:52.491 --> 04:56.620
I stole your Dentyne
with my big, strong hands.

05:02.835 --> 05:06.088
Good. You're not busy.
Steve doesn't know how to be a man.

05:06.255 --> 05:08.757
Who's gonna take over when I'm
enjoying a glorious...

05:08.923 --> 05:11.551
...Reagan-style slide into dementia?
What do you think?

05:11.718 --> 05:15.221
You're the smartest person I know.
I've always respected you even when...

05:15.388 --> 05:20.435
...you were drinking, doing that coke.
- Oh, Stan, thank you.

05:20.602 --> 05:23.480
Oh, God. Not you, Francine. God, no.

05:23.646 --> 05:26.149
I was talking to the photo
of George W. Bush.

05:26.316 --> 05:28.735
Look at you,
a perfect specimen of a man...

05:28.902 --> 05:30.862
...swaggering across your ranch.

05:31.029 --> 05:34.157
God, Tim Purcell
always got the best coke.

05:34.324 --> 05:37.035
That's it.
That's how I'll make them into men.

05:37.202 --> 05:40.121
Francine, bring those beautiful lips here
so I can kiss them.

05:40.288 --> 05:44.042
- Oh, Stan.
- Never mind. I can reach it.

05:50.256 --> 05:53.175
Rise and shine, boys.
Tell Sally Swimsuit Dream...

05:53.342 --> 05:55.427
...you'll take a rain check
on those kisses.

05:55.594 --> 05:57.804
Dad, it's 5 in the morning.

05:57.971 --> 06:00.599
Let's move.
The dawn of manhood has arrived.

06:01.391 --> 06:04.686
George Bush, Ronald Reagan,
Mr. Jolly.

06:04.853 --> 06:08.649
All ranchers, all men.

06:13.195 --> 06:15.113
Welcome to the Smith Man Ranch.

06:15.280 --> 06:19.451
You're cowboys now,
but when we're done, you'll be cowmen.

06:19.618 --> 06:24.581
So if any of you boys wanna cry or
wet yourselves, this is your last chance.

06:25.249 --> 06:27.292
Good, okay. This guy gets it.

06:29.253 --> 06:31.630
You filled our yard with cows?

06:31.797 --> 06:34.799
Good eye. Nice ranching.
I got a great deal on these things.

06:38.177 --> 06:39.595
They tenderise themselves.

06:39.762 --> 06:42.848
Well, good luck, Steve.
We're going to Pancake Pete's.

06:43.015 --> 06:46.435
It's Strawberry Saturday.

06:46.936 --> 06:49.730
Nope, you're staying here.
I cleared it with your parents.

06:49.897 --> 06:53.609
Slim... Your cowboy name... . Your mom
said your therapist thought it was great.

06:53.776 --> 06:57.196
Bonsai, your parents I couldn't
understand. I assume they're on board.

06:57.363 --> 06:59.532
Tubs, your folks seemed
not to care much.

06:59.699 --> 07:02.159
Almost surprised they had a kid.
Let's get to work.

07:02.326 --> 07:05.496
Not on Strawberry Saturday.

07:05.663 --> 07:07.331
Your parents said I could hit you.

07:07.873 --> 07:09.917
Hey.

07:10.084 --> 07:11.460
Hey, you.

07:11.627 --> 07:14.921
- Hi, Roger.
- Not you. Hey.

07:15.088 --> 07:17.757
- Hey, you.
- Oh, hey, Roger.

07:17.924 --> 07:20.719
Made you this. It's a diorama of us...

07:20.885 --> 07:23.346
...riding the gondola
at The Venetian in Vegas.

07:23.513 --> 07:24.597
Wow.

07:24.764 --> 07:27.642
I made you out of Twizzlers
cos you're thin and sweet.

07:27.809 --> 07:31.980
- That's very nice. Thanks, Roger.
- She likes it.

07:32.147 --> 07:36.318
- What was that all about?
- It's silly. Roger's got a crush on me.

07:36.484 --> 07:40.321
Look. He says I'm the prettiest girl
in the house.

07:42.032 --> 07:43.992
Roger.

07:45.577 --> 07:49.289
Last time I checked,
I lived in this house, too.

07:51.207 --> 07:54.878
Stop, stop. This is not what I pictured
when I was at the rope store.

07:55.045 --> 07:57.171
- It's hard.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:57.337 --> 07:59.715
Maybe you'd rather go bake a soufflÃ©?

07:59.882 --> 08:02.176
Oh, God, yes. Thank you.

08:28.869 --> 08:29.912
Dad, are we done?

08:30.078 --> 08:32.246
Yeah, Mr. Smith.
Can we have some food?

08:32.414 --> 08:35.958
Oh, absolutely. Can't expect a rancher
to ranch on an empty stomach.

08:36.126 --> 08:38.754
Boys, who would you say
loves the calf the most?

08:38.921 --> 08:42.756
I do. Rosie calms my dark places.

08:42.924 --> 08:45.718
- Terrific. Then it'll be you who kills her.
- What?

08:45.885 --> 08:48.930
A man kills what a man loves
before it weakens him.

08:49.096 --> 08:52.391
You can't make me kill Rosie.

08:54.852 --> 08:56.771
You boys sure
you don't want some Rosie?

08:56.938 --> 08:58.773
- No.
- No, thanks.

08:58.940 --> 09:02.527
I'm eating the face right now.
Good cut of face meat.

09:02.693 --> 09:05.822
Her eyes said, "Why?"

09:05.988 --> 09:10.993
Yeah, you can still see
the look of betrayal. Can't grill that off.

09:14.539 --> 09:15.832
What are you doing?

09:15.998 --> 09:18.709
Just sketching you nude
wearing the Heart of the Ocean.

09:18.876 --> 09:23.088
I'm flattered, but this infatuation,
it's getting...

09:23.255 --> 09:26.800
Wow, Franny. Look at you.

09:26.967 --> 09:32.472
Thanks. Just trying to look pretty
because, you know, I live in the house.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.517
Check you out. Bam in the bam.

09:35.684 --> 09:39.646
- The... in the:
- I thought you were drawing me.

09:39.813 --> 09:43.441
I was, but I never realised
your mother had the:

09:44.484 --> 09:48.280
Excuse me, Mom. I was about to
take Roger to Red Lobster.

09:48.446 --> 09:51.533
- You were?
- Did you know they have a new sauce?

09:51.700 --> 09:55.870
<i>They do? It wasn't in the Fresh Catch.
That's their e-bulletin.</i>

09:56.037 --> 09:58.665
I know that.
I was the one that told you about it.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.793
Fronging like you're on the cutting edge
of Red Lobster news.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.920
- Anyway, I thought you and I could go.
- Sure, Roger.

10:05.087 --> 10:07.464
Or you and I could go to a bar...

10:07.631 --> 10:11.051
...get rocked
on GoldschlÃ¤ger like grown-ups.

10:11.218 --> 10:15.597
- Oh, but Hayley's not old enough.
- I once made my own GoldschlÃ¤ger...

10:15.764 --> 10:19.393
...by mixing Red Hots, mouthwash
and tinfoil from a chocolate Easter egg.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.979
Surprisingly not good.

10:27.985 --> 10:29.528
Boys?

10:30.821 --> 10:32.740
What's going on?
Why aren't you working?

10:32.906 --> 10:35.826
We don't like working.
We like watching cartoons.

10:35.993 --> 10:37.328
Men don't do what they like.

10:37.494 --> 10:40.289
Men get wives and jobs
to keep them from what they like.

10:40.456 --> 10:44.418
Look, Dad. We don't wanna be men.
We're not tough, we don't take charge...

10:44.585 --> 10:45.918
...and we love quitting.

10:46.085 --> 10:48.588
And a yard full of cows
isn't change that.

10:51.341 --> 10:53.968
- We're going on a cattle drive?
- That's right, son.

10:54.135 --> 10:57.555
Making you ranchers in the backyard
was never gonna make you men.

10:57.722 --> 10:59.724
What you need is a rite of passage.

10:59.891 --> 11:03.061
Mr Smith, my unicorn is broken.

11:04.729 --> 11:08.357
We'll take these cows across town
and drop them off at the slaughterhouse.

11:08.524 --> 11:12.361
Just imagine how good it'll feel
to finish the job like men.

11:17.825 --> 11:19.911
Fvei hundred dollars a head?

11:20.078 --> 11:23.414
I don't know about that, Bonsai,
but we'll do all right.

11:23.581 --> 11:24.624
We'll do all right.

11:25.208 --> 11:29.086
Tough riding, but a little Rosie jerky
to keep me going.

11:29.252 --> 11:30.504
Boys?

11:30.670 --> 11:36.009
I can't believe you killed her, Barry.
You're a cold son of a bitch.

11:41.223 --> 11:42.682
Doorbell's ready.

11:44.226 --> 11:46.436
We're from
the Department of Agriculture.

11:46.603 --> 11:49.564
It seems you were sold cattle
tainted with mad cow disease.

11:49.731 --> 11:52.567
My husband taking them
to the slaughterhouse right now.

11:52.734 --> 11:54.277
- Good lord, we have to stop him.

11:54.444 --> 11:56.822
Ma'am, if you have any tainted beef,
throw it out.

11:56.988 --> 12:01.243
It's crucial no one eats it.
It drives them mad.

12:04.079 --> 12:06.331
You boys see these owls?
Get out of here, owls.

12:06.498 --> 12:07.666
Stop pecking at my face.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.667
I will not buy your encyclopedias.

12:09.834 --> 12:12.962
I can't read your language,
I can only speak it:

12:17.341 --> 12:18.551
Okay, that's weird.

12:18.717 --> 12:22.888
This would never have happened if we
went to my house after school, but no...

12:23.055 --> 12:26.725
...you guys are too creeped out
by my mom's wooden foot.

12:32.606 --> 12:35.609
You know, most people throw away
the hoof. Never understood it.

12:35.776 --> 12:39.780
None for you, owls. All right, boys.
On to the slaughterhouse.

12:39.947 --> 12:43.409
I think it's possible there just might be
something wrong with your dad.

12:43.576 --> 12:47.621
Oh, yeah? There's something wrong
with your dad, too. Your dad left you.

12:47.788 --> 12:49.665
I'm not comparing dads.

12:49.832 --> 12:54.127
I'm just saying yours is in his underwear,
swatting at invisible owls.

12:55.628 --> 12:57.964
Oh, yeah. Let me look into that.

12:58.131 --> 13:01.342
- Dad, is everything OK?
- Couldn't be better.

13:01.509 --> 13:05.638
Nature: Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful?

13:17.025 --> 13:20.486
<i>Well, my son is a sissy
With a Japanese friend</i>

13:20.653 --> 13:23.906
<i>But they're gonna be men
When the cattle drive ends</i>

13:24.073 --> 13:27.118
<i>Just one last canyon we must cross</i>

13:27.285 --> 13:31.956
<i>And we'll serve these cows
With a barbecue sauce</i>

13:34.541 --> 13:37.878
<i>Nothing like a cattle drive
As every father knows</i>

13:38.045 --> 13:40.922
<i>Prairie dog and jackrabbit
Stop and say hello</i>

13:41.089 --> 13:43.842
- Hey, Stan.
- Hello, friend.

13:49.973 --> 13:51.391
Join me on the yodel, fellas.

13:58.398 --> 14:00.484
Great job, Stan.

14:02.527 --> 14:04.321
Terrific.

14:10.202 --> 14:13.497
Dad, why are you dancing with
a beer box and a Filet-O-Fish wrapper?

14:13.663 --> 14:15.040
Happy trails, friends.

14:15.207 --> 14:19.752
All right, boys, all we gotta do is
cross that river and we'll be home free.

14:21.379 --> 14:23.422
Dad, that's not a river.
That's a highway.

14:23.589 --> 14:26.759
Steve, take off that lobster costume
and wrap our gear in plastic.

14:26.926 --> 14:28.636
We don't want it to get wet.

14:28.803 --> 14:31.180
This is crazy.
Your dad is gonna kill us all.

14:31.347 --> 14:34.183
Your dad shot your mom in the face
with a flare gun.

14:34.350 --> 14:36.894
I'm sorry, Snot.
I don't mean to keep going there.

14:37.061 --> 14:39.980
- We gotta stop him.
- All right. Relax. Relax.

14:40.147 --> 14:43.651
We'll just relieve him of command.
Huddle up.

14:43.818 --> 14:45.986
Barry, you approach him
from the front...

14:46.153 --> 14:47.738
...complaining of a tummy ache.

14:47.905 --> 14:50.241
When he reaches out to hit you,
Toshi and Snot...

14:50.407 --> 14:53.410
...you grab his arms
and pull them back as hard as you can

14:53.577 --> 14:56.747
I'll then take this rock
and strike him until he's quiet.

14:56.914 --> 14:58.665
- You guys ready?
- Ready.

15:03.128 --> 15:04.796
I am so frightened.

15:04.963 --> 15:08.258
He's much bigger
than you made him look in the dirt.

15:08.424 --> 15:10.802
Damn it. Who are we kidding?
We're not men.

15:10.969 --> 15:13.805
We're puny little bunnies,
and that's all we'll ever be.

15:17.559 --> 15:21.020
All right, men, saddle up.
I'll blaze the trail, you follow.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.106
Meet you on the other side.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.899
Dad, no.

15:36.786 --> 15:39.956
- Those logs are gonna fall.
- Let's call a teacher.

15:40.123 --> 15:44.084
There's no time.
He may be crazy, but he's my dad.

15:51.341 --> 15:54.803
Moths. Why did it have to be moths?

16:09.610 --> 16:11.987
Hang on, Steve.

16:23.914 --> 16:26.500
I can't hold it.

16:37.219 --> 16:40.556
Now, we can forget about
this stupid cattle drive and go home.

16:45.561 --> 16:49.815
No. Rule number three:
A man never quits.

16:49.982 --> 16:52.985
We're gonna bring these cattle
to slaughter.

16:54.612 --> 16:57.281
- Toshi. I think this is yours.
- Mine had the white band.

16:57.448 --> 16:59.825
Mine is a hat.

17:06.330 --> 17:10.877
Wow, Hayley,
look at you... technical knockout.

17:11.044 --> 17:13.546
Francine, doesn't she look terrific?

17:13.713 --> 17:18.926
Look at that body. Young, firm,
everything's where it should be.

17:19.094 --> 17:21.346
I guess she is the prettiest one
in the house.

17:21.512 --> 17:22.597
Oh, really?

17:22.763 --> 17:25.433
Because all I see are tissue boobs.

17:26.309 --> 17:29.396
- Fakeys.
- Well, You know what I see?

17:29.562 --> 17:31.272
Crow's-feet.

17:32.023 --> 17:33.691
Age-defying make-up.

17:33.858 --> 17:35.110
- Hag.
- Tramp.

17:35.276 --> 17:38.321
Ladies, please. No violence.

17:40.949 --> 17:44.786
- Get off of me, you cow.
- I'll spit in your lazy eye.

17:44.953 --> 17:47.788
- I had that corrected.
- I can still tell.

17:47.955 --> 17:49.623
I can't condone this.

17:56.046 --> 17:59.633
You love each other, remember?
These are here if you want them.

18:02.177 --> 18:05.264
Bite her, Hayley.
Scratch her eyes out, Francine.

18:05.430 --> 18:08.725
- What are you doing?
- Perfect. I think I got enough.

18:08.892 --> 18:13.689
- Enough? Enough for what?
- Why, for motherdaughtercatfight. Com.

18:13.856 --> 18:16.859
You submit footage of your best
mother-daughter scratchfest...

18:17.025 --> 18:19.528
...and they send you a free T-shirt.

18:19.695 --> 18:25.993
You set all this up? The liquor-store girl?
The diorama? Just for a T-shirt?

18:26.160 --> 18:27.661
I think I'm gonna get a medium.

18:27.828 --> 18:29.745
I'm a large,
but I'm gonna get a medium.

18:29.912 --> 18:33.291
We became animals.

18:33.457 --> 18:37.336
And for the record,
I'm the prettiest one in the house.

18:40.590 --> 18:41.883
There it is.

18:46.512 --> 18:50.182
- Stop.
- I told you we had time for ice cream.

18:50.349 --> 18:54.812
- You boys can't do this.
- No boys here. Only men.

18:54.979 --> 18:58.024
Let's get these doggies home.

19:00.359 --> 19:02.278
No, stop.

19:06.198 --> 19:07.491
We did it.

19:10.952 --> 19:14.372
Those cows will infect the entire herd.
You've tainted the beef supply.

19:14.539 --> 19:15.707
Maybe it won't spread.

19:23.798 --> 19:27.344
I, sir, will not stay at a Red Roof Inn.

19:27.510 --> 19:31.389
So that's how it happened.
My fever went down about a week later.

19:31.556 --> 19:34.434
Sir, in all my years
of attending beef safety hearings...

19:34.601 --> 19:37.228
...that is the wildest story
I've ever heard.

19:37.395 --> 19:42.525
Your irresponsible actions resulted in
100,000 head of cattle being put down.

19:42.692 --> 19:46.279
It's clear to me you deserve punishment
to the fullest extent of the law.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.616
- Wait.
- Frank, that fat child has an opinion.

19:49.783 --> 19:55.120
Maybe Mr. Smith is crazy,
but Mr. Smith also taught me to be tough.

19:55.287 --> 19:59.583
That's right. He taught us about
never giving up and acting like men.

19:59.750 --> 20:02.920
Maybe a cattle drive through a city
wasn't the best idea,

20:03.087 --> 20:05.881
but my dad showed us
what it means to take charge.

20:06.048 --> 20:09.635
And when we needed to,
we were ready, thanks to him.

20:11.303 --> 20:13.639
- Still...
- Toshi, tell him.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.872
I didn't understand a word
of that funny talk,

20:40.039 --> 20:44.210
but it was clearly a touching tribute
to you as a mentor, Mr Smith.

20:44.377 --> 20:49.590
You taught these boys manhood,
and that's worth all the cows in the world.

20:49.757 --> 20:52.176
All charges dropped.

20:56.013 --> 20:59.350
- Thanks, Dad.
- You made me proud, son.

21:50.650 --> 21:52.736
