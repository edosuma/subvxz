<i>Previously on Cardinal...</i>

00:02.907 --> 00:04.607
<i>He buys black market chips,</i>

00:04.608 --> 00:05.642
<i>cashes them in.</i>

00:05.643 --> 00:08.244
It shows how Cardinal
launders his rat money.

00:08.913 --> 00:10.576
<i>What's the story here, Francis?</i>

00:10.577 --> 00:11.729
None of your business.

00:11.730 --> 00:13.036
I shouldn't have told your mom

00:13.037 --> 00:14.771
that we're trying to have a baby.

00:14.772 --> 00:15.906
I'm sorry.

00:15.907 --> 00:17.780
<i>Speaking of which, shouldn't
we know something?</i>

00:17.781 --> 00:19.586
<i>No. I found
out a couple days ago.</i>

00:19.587 --> 00:22.079
<i>My wife has bipolar disorder.</i>

00:22.080 --> 00:25.148
<i>Our thief is
staking out these stores.</i>

00:25.149 --> 00:27.384
<i>He follows his targets
home with their new stuff,</i>

00:27.385 --> 00:29.419
then he hits their house later.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.954
<i>Melissa and Douglas London.</i>

00:30.955 --> 00:31.955
<i>Their son, Keith,</i>

00:31.956 --> 00:33.624
<i>was supposed to arrive home last night</i>

00:33.625 --> 00:35.125
and never turned up.

00:35.126 --> 00:36.746
<i>He has his next victim.</i>

00:36.961 --> 00:38.661
<i>This is Edie's show now.</i>

00:38.897 --> 00:41.131
I know she doesn't look like much,

00:41.733 --> 00:42.733
but she's ready.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.271
I made him bleed.

<i>That is something you,</i>

01:26.344 --> 01:27.945
<i>you learn very early on,</i>

01:27.946 --> 01:30.805
not to judge by volume.

01:31.716 --> 01:32.983
<i>That...</i>

01:32.984 --> 01:35.055
<i>that could be a laptop,</i>

01:35.320 --> 01:38.000
or maybe it's just a blender.

01:39.824 --> 01:42.059
Yeah, it's
funny, you know, people,

01:42.060 --> 01:43.293
they ask me that all the time.

01:43.294 --> 01:44.597
They do. Everybody wants to know

01:44.598 --> 01:46.530
how you stayed in the game for so long?

01:46.531 --> 01:47.691
<i>Well, I don't mind answering.</i>

01:47.715 --> 01:48.632
<i>It's a good question.</i>

01:48.633 --> 01:50.266
<i>People think it's a
lot of ducking around</i>

01:50.267 --> 01:52.134
<i>and diving and all that
stuff but it's not.</i>

01:52.135 --> 01:54.350
<i>It's-it's waiting.</i>

01:55.173 --> 01:56.473
<i>And now,</i>

01:56.975 --> 01:58.141
do we really believe that.

01:58.142 --> 02:01.900
White Trash Johnny's got
that boutique guitar?

02:20.898 --> 02:22.399
<i>Man, that is like a sieve.</i>

02:22.400 --> 02:25.817
<i>I could get in and
out of there so fast.</i>

02:31.175 --> 02:35.056
<i>Nobody is watching this.</i>

03:10.081 --> 03:12.382
Where's Keith?

03:15.486 --> 03:17.587
Where's Keith?

03:22.660 --> 03:23.894
<i>Where's Keith?</i>

03:51.622 --> 03:52.622
Hey.

03:52.623 --> 03:53.923
Hey.

03:55.126 --> 03:57.956
I can't stay. I'm on my way in.

03:58.463 --> 03:59.763
John.

04:01.299 --> 04:04.206
You didn't say that
you found Katie Pine.

04:05.369 --> 04:06.603
Who told you about that?

04:06.604 --> 04:08.271
You shouldn't be thinking about that.

04:08.272 --> 04:09.572
Hey.

04:10.108 --> 04:11.408
All right, come here.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.894
Well that looks fun.

05:04.996 --> 05:06.496
<i>Yeah, all hands on deck.</i>

05:07.698 --> 05:08.732
Yeah, word got out

05:08.733 --> 05:10.200
the killer's got another victim.

05:10.201 --> 05:12.002
<i>Phones have been ringing off the hook.</i>

05:12.003 --> 05:14.137
<i>Now we've got press
coming from all over.</i>

05:24.949 --> 05:26.049
<i>Commanda?</i>

05:26.050 --> 05:27.317
<i>Hold up.</i>

05:29.287 --> 05:30.587
<i>Hey.</i>

05:31.722 --> 05:33.022
<i>Question for you.</i>

05:33.891 --> 05:35.258
Do you have any reason to believe

05:35.259 --> 05:36.526
there is money being laundered

05:36.527 --> 05:37.907
through Thunderbird Casino?

05:38.062 --> 05:40.196
Well nothing organized,
just small stuff.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.853
<i>You know who's doing it?</i>

05:45.102 --> 05:46.603
Point you in a direction.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.258
Is this a factor in the killings?

05:50.141 --> 05:52.809
A loose end from when
I was at Financial.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.878
My old Sergeant's leaning on me,

05:54.879 --> 05:55.946
<i>which is why I was hoping</i>

05:55.947 --> 05:57.480
<i>I could ask a favour.</i>

05:57.481 --> 05:59.616
My suspect cashed in
chips four nights ago.

06:01.129 --> 06:02.552
Knowing that do you think you could

06:02.553 --> 06:03.987
get your hands on some of the money

06:03.988 --> 06:05.288
he used to buy them?

06:05.590 --> 06:06.890
Get my hands on it.

06:08.259 --> 06:09.559
Just some serial numbers.

06:10.595 --> 06:11.895
A sample.

06:12.230 --> 06:13.997
If I can trace the money
back to its source,

06:13.998 --> 06:15.298
it could help me.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.469
I don't suppose you're gonna
tell me who your suspect is.

06:19.470 --> 06:22.639
I don't want to implicate anyone
if this doesn't prove out.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.380
<i>If it does you'll hear all about it.</i>

06:25.509 --> 06:26.509
<i>Delorme?</i>

06:26.510 --> 06:29.079
<i>Keith London came by bus.</i>

06:29.080 --> 06:30.380
His parents confirmed it.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.884
Does he know you're working two jobs?

06:35.453 --> 06:36.753
He'd kill me.

06:37.622 --> 06:38.922
Keep it to yourself?

06:40.758 --> 06:42.258
I'll see what I can do.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.981
<i>So what was that all about?</i>

06:53.004 --> 06:54.304
You and Commanda?

06:55.539 --> 06:57.615
I worked with him on
the Latraverse case.

06:58.009 --> 07:00.043
He was our point man on the reserve.

07:01.279 --> 07:02.579
Just catching up.

07:03.848 --> 07:05.348
I'm sorry, I gotta take this.

07:07.118 --> 07:08.418
Yeah?

07:10.554 --> 07:11.854
Okay.

07:13.524 --> 07:14.824
Yeah, I will.

07:15.526 --> 07:17.026
No, Josh, I will.

07:19.864 --> 07:21.064
Sorry.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.365
It's fine.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.705
Hasn't been easy for him,

07:29.874 --> 07:31.374
my transfer from Financial.

07:32.343 --> 07:34.044
The different pace.

07:34.045 --> 07:35.345
Yeah, well it's...

07:35.646 --> 07:36.946
it's not always this way.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.850
But this is what I always wanted,

07:42.486 --> 07:43.786
to be homicide.

07:46.490 --> 07:47.691
I mean no one grows up hoping

07:47.692 --> 07:49.312
to investigate real estate fraud.

07:50.895 --> 07:52.395
So how'd you end up there?

07:53.597 --> 07:54.897
I was good at it.

07:57.668 --> 07:58.968
Doors kept opening.

08:02.239 --> 08:03.239
I was there.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.540
It was easy.

08:08.212 --> 08:10.432
Do you know anything about
audiovisual equipment?

08:12.216 --> 08:13.716
I can't get it to play.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.645
<i>I know it works. I've played it before.</i>

08:18.522 --> 08:19.522
Edie,

08:19.523 --> 08:20.863
she still has this manual.

08:22.778 --> 08:24.761
<i>It's sort of classic Edie
when you think about it,</i>

08:24.762 --> 08:26.062
<i>keeping this filed away.</i>

08:27.598 --> 08:30.567
<i>I think it has like some sort
of sentimental value to it,</i>

08:30.568 --> 08:33.068
<i>'cause her mom bought
it in some sort of</i>

08:33.070 --> 08:35.203
<i>rare spasm of sobriety.</i>

08:35.972 --> 08:36.972
Some friend

08:36.974 --> 08:39.976
bought them a VHS tape
about a skin thing,

08:39.977 --> 08:41.277
some sort of

08:41.544 --> 08:44.114
<i>new abrasion laser thing for the eczema</i>

08:44.115 --> 08:47.083
<i>and it just sat there for months</i>

08:47.084 --> 08:49.886
<i>unwatched like some sort of beacon.</i>

08:49.887 --> 08:50.887
<i>That's how Edie puts it,</i>

08:50.888 --> 08:52.188
<i>like a beacon of hope.</i>

08:52.823 --> 08:54.157
But also if you think about it,

08:54.158 --> 08:56.760
it was like a beacon of neglect, right?

08:56.761 --> 08:57.961
<i>Like by her mom,</i>

08:57.962 --> 08:59.462
<i>to just let it sit there?</i>

08:59.964 --> 09:02.432
And anyways through the
right combination of.

09:02.433 --> 09:03.767
Edie's begging

09:03.768 --> 09:08.471
and some sort of uptick
in maternal hormones,

09:08.472 --> 09:10.340
she stepped up

09:10.341 --> 09:12.942
<i>and bought this very VCR</i>

09:12.943 --> 09:15.278
<i>so they could watch
it together and,</i>

09:15.279 --> 09:16.579
that's what they did.

09:18.749 --> 09:20.049
And what happened?

09:20.818 --> 09:22.952
What do you mean?
That's the end of the story.

09:27.858 --> 09:30.093
<i>6:30 from
Sudbury two nights ago.</i>

09:30.094 --> 09:31.277
<i>Yeah, to be honest,</i>

09:31.278 --> 09:32.662
<i>so many people come through.</i>

09:32.663 --> 09:34.243
<i>Does that camera work?</i>

09:35.366 --> 09:36.366
Imagine so.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.834
<i>Call your boss,</i>

09:37.835 --> 09:39.969
<i>tell him we need tapes
from every camera</i>

09:39.970 --> 09:41.033
<i>in the station, all right?</i>

09:41.034 --> 09:41.971
<i>Tell him</i>

09:41.972 --> 09:43.807
<i>if the system erases on a loop</i>

09:43.808 --> 09:45.628
<i>that it needs to be stopped instantly.</i>

09:46.444 --> 09:48.678
Do I need to say any of that again?

09:48.679 --> 09:49.779
I'll call my boss.

09:49.780 --> 09:51.883
And we need to know if there
is any unclaimed luggage

09:51.884 --> 09:53.184
from that bus.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.599
They're checking surrounding
businesses for CCTV.

10:02.860 --> 10:05.195
Yeah, well, there's nothing
in here to indicate he was

10:05.196 --> 10:06.496
meeting anyone.

10:06.964 --> 10:08.264
Guitar supplies but

10:08.732 --> 10:10.032
<i>no guitar.</i>

10:10.501 --> 10:11.924
<i>No, he'd take it with him.</i>

10:11.925 --> 10:12.869
If he has a guitar,

10:12.870 --> 10:14.170
he wouldn't check it.

10:16.373 --> 10:18.141
Have you never dated a musician?

10:18.142 --> 10:19.442
No. You?

10:20.311 --> 10:21.611
One or two.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.380
So he, um,

10:25.015 --> 10:26.315
takes his guitar

10:27.151 --> 10:28.451
into the night,

10:29.854 --> 10:31.654
planning to be back for the

10:31.655 --> 10:33.089
ten o'clock to Toronto.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.157
Yeah.

10:34.158 --> 10:35.191
Where do you go

10:35.192 --> 10:37.326
in Algonquin Bay to kill three hours?

10:41.699 --> 10:42.899
<i>Let's do Willow Street,</i>

10:42.900 --> 10:43.900
<i>work our way downtown.</i>

10:43.901 --> 10:45.201
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:47.271 --> 10:49.689
<i>The killer had Katie
Pine for over a week,</i>

10:49.874 --> 10:51.654
<i>finished off Curry in just four days.</i>

10:55.079 --> 10:56.459
<i>Might be nothing.</i>

10:56.714 --> 10:58.014
<i>Might be situational.</i>

10:58.716 --> 11:00.216
<i>Or he's accelerating.</i>

11:01.118 --> 11:02.752
<i>Isn't that how these guys work?</i>

11:02.753 --> 11:04.754
It takes more and more
to get them excited so

11:04.755 --> 11:06.535
they speed up through their routines.

11:09.393 --> 11:11.093
He might be tired of Keith already.

11:32.383 --> 11:33.683
<i>Drink.</i>

11:44.795 --> 11:46.095
Okay Keith,

11:46.897 --> 11:48.598
this is gonna be very hard to watch

11:49.500 --> 11:51.033
but I need you to watch it.

11:53.404 --> 11:55.656
<i>So if you can't keep your eyes open,</i>

11:58.108 --> 11:59.408
<i>I can help you.</i>

12:13.524 --> 12:15.057
Let me know what you think.

12:35.813 --> 12:39.349
<i>Hey, hey, hey, wake up.</i>

12:39.350 --> 12:41.284
<i>Wake up, come on.</i>

12:41.285 --> 12:45.054
<i>Hey, it's okay. It's okay.</i>

12:45.055 --> 12:47.056
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

13:11.888 --> 13:13.191
<i>Here we are, we are,</i>

13:13.192 --> 13:14.489
<i>the people of Babel.</i>

13:14.490 --> 13:15.924
<i>We're just, you know, around,</i>

13:15.925 --> 13:17.426
<i>going about our business.</i>

13:17.427 --> 13:18.727
No.

13:18.828 --> 13:20.095
It's God

13:20.096 --> 13:23.231
<i>and God is not happy.</i>

13:23.232 --> 13:24.599
<i>Na-ha.</i>

13:24.600 --> 13:27.169
<i>- Nah-ha. I'm not happy.
- Hello, boys.</i>

13:27.170 --> 13:28.470
<i>Not happy at all.</i>

13:29.672 --> 13:31.673
<i>- Hi.
- Hi. Nooo!</i>

13:31.674 --> 13:33.508
<i>You have smitten us down.</i>

13:33.509 --> 13:34.509
<i>Whatcha doin'?</i>

13:34.510 --> 13:35.610
I'm just,

13:35.611 --> 13:39.081
teaching Aiden the fine
art of smiting the people.

13:41.084 --> 13:42.384
<i>So I,</i>

13:42.952 --> 13:44.452
I ran into Don today.

13:45.455 --> 13:47.442
<i>He said that you should come by.</i>

13:47.991 --> 13:49.124
<i>Hey.</i>

13:50.460 --> 13:52.361
Okay. Right.

13:52.362 --> 13:53.362
Yeah, today at four.

13:53.363 --> 13:55.163
He said that he's had
some turnover lately

13:55.164 --> 13:56.827
and he could probably
get you some shifts.

13:56.828 --> 13:58.128
Hi!

13:59.602 --> 14:00.836
Jesus Christ.

14:00.837 --> 14:02.204
Just go by.

14:02.205 --> 14:03.805
See what he has to say.

14:05.775 --> 14:06.775
Did you run into him

14:06.776 --> 14:08.076
or did you call him?

14:09.846 --> 14:11.146
Did you call him?

14:11.814 --> 14:13.514
The police were at our door, Woody.

14:14.150 --> 14:15.784
Listen, it is a real job

14:15.785 --> 14:18.220
<i>with a real wage and a regular shift.</i>

14:18.221 --> 14:19.654
Yeah, and all I have to do is

14:19.655 --> 14:21.289
kiss your brother's ass.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.457
He's trying to help.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.998
<i>He doesn't have to help.</i>

14:24.127 --> 14:26.027
Why does he think he needs to help us?

14:26.195 --> 14:28.397
<i>Perhaps because you undermine
me in front of him.</i>

14:28.398 --> 14:30.418
Is that what I'm doing?
I'm undermining you?

14:30.800 --> 14:33.835
Baby, I just need you to
have faith in me, okay?

14:33.836 --> 14:35.337
<i>This is who I am.</i>

14:36.005 --> 14:37.505
You knew that when you met me.

14:39.142 --> 14:40.482
Yeah, well, things change.

14:45.181 --> 14:46.481
Today at four.

14:46.916 --> 14:48.650
I'll know if you don't turn up.

14:54.524 --> 14:56.024
Yeah, the kid with a guitar.

14:56.859 --> 14:58.159
He was here?

14:59.262 --> 15:00.562
Are you sure?

15:00.730 --> 15:02.064
He got sick.

15:02.065 --> 15:03.665
I remember people who get sick.

15:03.666 --> 15:05.200
<i>What? He threw up?</i>

15:05.201 --> 15:06.501
<i>Two beers in.</i>

15:06.502 --> 15:09.404
<i>So either he got started
before he got here or</i>

15:09.405 --> 15:10.505
<i>I don't know, maybe he had</i>

15:10.506 --> 15:11.609
<i>some sort of stomach thing.</i>

15:11.610 --> 15:12.910
Did he come alone?

15:14.410 --> 15:15.544
It was a busy night.

15:15.545 --> 15:17.012
Did he talk with anyone?

15:17.013 --> 15:18.346
Leave with anyone?

15:18.347 --> 15:19.647
Look, I'm sorry.

15:20.249 --> 15:21.829
<i>Your staff that night.</i>

15:22.685 --> 15:23.919
Names and numbers.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.253
Write 'em down, please.

15:25.254 --> 15:26.957
And any customers you recall,
any regulars.

15:26.958 --> 15:29.291
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, write those down too.

15:29.292 --> 15:30.759
And then we'll be out of your hair.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.795
<i>Toxicology says Todd Curry had a,</i>

15:33.796 --> 15:35.864
a cocktail of drugs in his system,

15:35.865 --> 15:36.865
prescription stuff,

15:36.866 --> 15:38.200
stuff a doctor wouldn't mix.

15:38.201 --> 15:40.101
<i>No 'cause it will make you sick.</i>

15:41.571 --> 15:42.571
You see Keith

15:42.572 --> 15:43.572
at the bar.

15:43.573 --> 15:45.040
At the bus station, either way.

15:45.041 --> 15:47.209
You follow him. You see he's alone.

15:47.210 --> 15:48.510
You spike his drink.

15:48.611 --> 15:50.545
He gets sick, he gets weak.

15:51.447 --> 15:52.747
You scoop him up.

15:53.216 --> 15:55.083
- Let's put together a canvass.
- Yeah.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.085
Clinics, pharmacies, veterinarians.

15:57.086 --> 15:59.254
Anyone who might stock this stuff.

15:59.255 --> 16:01.156
Find out if there's been any

16:01.157 --> 16:03.492
thefts or any break-ins.

16:10.399 --> 16:11.699
Someone you know?

16:14.604 --> 16:15.904
No.

16:34.157 --> 16:35.690
Come on.

16:35.691 --> 16:36.991
<i>Can I come in?</i>

16:37.426 --> 16:38.627
I got nothing to say to you.

16:38.628 --> 16:39.628
<i>That's okay,</i>

16:39.629 --> 16:40.929
<i>I'll do the talking.</i>

16:42.532 --> 16:45.000
<i>I wanted to talk about
a client of yours.</i>

16:45.001 --> 16:46.601
I don't have clients, A,

16:46.602 --> 16:49.737
and, B, it's not against the
law to have poker chips.

16:49.972 --> 16:51.752
We went through that just last visit.

16:53.276 --> 16:54.936
<i>Is there coffee I smell?</i>

16:55.678 --> 16:56.978
It's old.

16:56.979 --> 16:58.279
Hours or days?

16:58.281 --> 16:59.481
This morning.

16:59.482 --> 17:00.782
May I?

17:01.184 --> 17:02.484
Knock yourself out.

17:10.459 --> 17:11.759
<i>So,</i>

17:12.627 --> 17:13.928
<i>a few nights ago</i>

17:14.696 --> 17:16.196
<i>a client of yours cashed out,</i>

17:17.700 --> 17:20.835
<i>which means that you probably
sold him some chips recently.</i>

17:22.171 --> 17:24.472
<i>Would you happen to have any of that</i>

17:24.473 --> 17:25.973
money left that he paid?

17:28.644 --> 17:29.878
Is this a shakedown?

17:29.879 --> 17:30.979
No.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.180
Because look around,

17:32.181 --> 17:34.816
there's not a lot you can
pull out of me here.

17:34.817 --> 17:37.085
This is not a shakedown, Francis.

17:37.086 --> 17:38.186
If you'd open your eyes,

17:38.187 --> 17:40.822
you'd see that something
positive was happening here.

17:40.823 --> 17:42.123
<i>How's that?</i>

17:42.285 --> 17:43.508
Well I'm coming for your help,

17:43.509 --> 17:45.360
which means I'm not coming for you.

17:45.361 --> 17:46.828
If I had a client

17:46.829 --> 17:48.496
and if I sold him chips,

17:48.497 --> 17:49.797
which I didn't,

17:50.533 --> 17:51.533
you'll never get him.

17:57.406 --> 17:58.706
So what tells you that?

18:00.776 --> 18:02.076
All of history.

18:03.446 --> 18:04.879
Some types you just don't catch,

18:04.880 --> 18:06.180
let's put it that way.

18:07.183 --> 18:08.883
Well maybe we need to change that.

18:14.957 --> 18:16.700
I scheduled a press
conference this evening.

18:16.701 --> 18:17.726
I want you there.

18:17.727 --> 18:19.027
To say what?

18:19.028 --> 18:20.262
That we're nowhere?

18:20.263 --> 18:21.863
It comes from above.

18:21.864 --> 18:23.865
People need to know that
action is being taken.

18:23.866 --> 18:25.166
People do?

18:25.268 --> 18:26.568
Or management does?

18:35.444 --> 18:36.811
<i>Mister and Mrs. London,</i>

18:36.812 --> 18:38.947
<i>I'm Detective Sergeant Noelle Dyson.</i>

18:41.584 --> 18:42.584
The police in Toronto

18:42.585 --> 18:45.120
have shared with us that Keith

18:45.121 --> 18:48.556
was in constant contact with
his girlfriend, Claire,

18:48.557 --> 18:49.591
<i>but that you</i>

18:49.592 --> 18:51.626
<i>haven't spoken to him in over a week?</i>

18:51.627 --> 18:52.927
That's right.

18:52.995 --> 18:55.263
<i>Well the last message</i>

18:55.264 --> 18:56.564
<i>sent from Keith's phone</i>

18:58.768 --> 19:00.068
was this picture.

19:02.972 --> 19:04.339
<i>Does that seem</i>

19:04.340 --> 19:06.046
<i>out of character for your son?</i>

19:06.047 --> 19:07.786
Well, yes.

19:08.244 --> 19:09.944
<i>Why would he send that?</i>

19:09.945 --> 19:11.605
<i>It's possible he didn't.</i>

19:12.348 --> 19:15.016
That's what we're trying to find out.

19:15.017 --> 19:17.585
<i>We know when the message was sent.</i>

19:17.586 --> 19:19.688
What we're trying to
work out is from where.

19:19.689 --> 19:22.824
This man has been in
your town for months

19:23.659 --> 19:24.959
<i>hunting.</i>

19:25.428 --> 19:26.728
<i>Is that true?</i>

19:29.799 --> 19:31.099
Yes.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.734
How do you let that happen?

19:35.304 --> 19:36.964
<i>Keith never should have been here.</i>

19:37.873 --> 19:39.173
<i>It's my fault.</i>

19:39.709 --> 19:41.009
What do you mean?

19:41.510 --> 19:43.610
We told him after high
school he could travel.

19:44.513 --> 19:46.014
<i>We thought he'd go overseas.</i>

19:47.116 --> 19:48.650
He wanted to go out west

19:48.651 --> 19:49.951
and see his friends

19:51.187 --> 19:52.487
and write music.

19:53.889 --> 19:55.423
I fought him.

19:57.026 --> 19:58.760
Told him it was a waste of time,

20:00.629 --> 20:01.929
insisted he come home.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.136
He refused so I cut off his credit card

20:09.739 --> 20:11.039
<i>to force him back.</i>

20:13.576 --> 20:16.310
He was on that bus because of me.

20:29.058 --> 20:30.358
<i>Hey.</i>

20:31.861 --> 20:32.861
<i>You were right.</i>

20:32.862 --> 20:34.729
<i>We need to have a press conference.</i>

20:34.730 --> 20:36.030
Well, thank you.

20:36.031 --> 20:37.331
It's not up for debate.

20:37.533 --> 20:38.833
Why the change of heart?

20:39.735 --> 20:41.235
We need to get the word out,

20:41.237 --> 20:42.537
what we know.

20:59.789 --> 21:01.089
Stop.

21:02.091 --> 21:03.391
What's with you?

21:05.761 --> 21:07.141
Don't talk about my mother.

21:09.698 --> 21:10.998
This is the VCR thing?

21:13.202 --> 21:14.502
It's not his business.

21:15.271 --> 21:17.531
Yeah, well, it's not like
he's gonna tell anybody.

21:20.109 --> 21:21.309
Well,

21:21.310 --> 21:22.377
I don't like it, Eric,

21:22.378 --> 21:23.711
so don't do it.

21:23.712 --> 21:25.012
Hey.

21:25.147 --> 21:26.447
Hey.

21:27.817 --> 21:29.584
Your mother is nothing, Edie.

21:29.585 --> 21:31.085
She's a hole in the air.

21:35.925 --> 21:36.991
I want you to think about

21:36.992 --> 21:40.261
how you're gonna
finish Keith off, okay?

21:40.262 --> 21:41.562
Picture it.

21:42.264 --> 21:44.265
'Cause once you do it,

21:44.266 --> 21:45.767
no one's gonna hurt you again.

21:49.805 --> 21:50.972
Hey.

21:52.341 --> 21:55.477
Tonight you say goodbye
to the little girl

21:55.478 --> 21:57.512
who your mom shit on

21:57.513 --> 21:59.147
and say hello

21:59.148 --> 22:01.205
to whoever you want to be.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.053
I can't wait.

22:50.019 --> 22:51.802
<i>I got a truck with
a busted transmission</i>

22:51.803 --> 22:53.937
<i>and I'm down a driver to the flu so,</i>

22:55.258 --> 22:56.798
<i>clients calling left and right.</i>

23:02.865 --> 23:03.999
Heavy is the

23:04.000 --> 23:05.500
head that wears the crown?

23:06.702 --> 23:08.002
Have a seat.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.140
So, I ran into my sister.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.142
That's okay, Don.
I know she called you,

23:14.143 --> 23:15.483
<i>you don't have to pretend.</i>

23:17.346 --> 23:18.780
Well look,

23:18.781 --> 23:19.781
I do have some hours

23:19.782 --> 23:21.850
if this is something
you're interested in.

23:21.851 --> 23:23.518
You comfortable with a plow rig?

23:23.519 --> 23:24.786
You know,

23:24.787 --> 23:27.155
got a steering wheel, I can drive it.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.857
And you're okay with
the early mornings?

23:30.226 --> 23:32.527
If I haven't smoked too
much meth the night before.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.298
Woody, look,

23:38.167 --> 23:40.101
I know you got it in your head that...

23:41.971 --> 23:43.271
I don't know...

23:43.406 --> 23:44.939
I may not think highly of you,

23:46.509 --> 23:47.809
<i>but I'm telling you this,</i>

23:48.544 --> 23:50.278
<i>I just want to help my sister.</i>

23:51.147 --> 23:52.647
Now do you want this or not?

23:58.821 --> 24:00.121
I do.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.090
Okay.

24:02.091 --> 24:03.551
You start tomorrow, five a.m.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.393
Great.

24:05.394 --> 24:06.561
<i>There is the issue</i>

24:06.562 --> 24:07.862
<i>of the other stuff,</i>

24:08.431 --> 24:09.864
<i>the way of life.</i>

24:09.865 --> 24:11.866
<i>That's gonna have to end, Woody,</i>

24:11.867 --> 24:13.167
<i>one hundred percent.</i>

24:15.371 --> 24:16.371
I'm sorry.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.106
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:18.107 --> 24:19.587
I have a reputation in this community

24:19.588 --> 24:20.955
and I can't have one of my guys

24:20.956 --> 24:22.010
caught up in that.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.012
It has to stop.

24:26.449 --> 24:27.749
That's why I'm here.

24:28.517 --> 24:29.617
Good.

24:29.618 --> 24:30.818
I'm relieved.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.520
<i>I know Kristen's relieved</i>

24:32.521 --> 24:33.821
<i>and hey,</i>

24:34.123 --> 24:35.746
<i>we all have to grow
up eventually, right?</i>

24:48.037 --> 24:49.203
Good evening.

24:50.172 --> 24:52.198
This will be a brief statement

24:52.199 --> 24:55.101
and we aren't taking any
questions at this time.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.169
<i>Seven days ago,</i>

24:56.170 --> 24:58.271
<i>the body of Katie Pine, 13,</i>

24:58.272 --> 25:00.440
of the Nipissing First Nations,

25:00.441 --> 25:03.078
was found on Windigo Island.

25:03.079 --> 25:04.113
<i>Two days later,</i>

25:04.114 --> 25:05.581
<i>on March 8th,</i>

25:05.582 --> 25:08.283
<i>we discovered the body
of Todd Curry, 17,</i>

25:08.284 --> 25:09.718
<i>of Sudbury.</i>

25:09.719 --> 25:12.888
We have reason to suspect
foul play in both instances

25:12.889 --> 25:15.624
and we have reason to believe
that they are connected.

25:15.625 --> 25:17.993
We also believe that a third person

25:17.994 --> 25:19.895
<i>may be in jeopardy.</i>

25:19.896 --> 25:21.263
<i>Detective John Cardinal</i>

25:21.264 --> 25:22.698
<i>is the Chief Investigator.</i>

25:29.305 --> 25:31.068
We are appealing to the public

25:31.069 --> 25:32.102
for information about

25:32.103 --> 25:34.104
Keith Russell London.

25:34.105 --> 25:35.405
He's 19,

25:36.041 --> 25:37.341
from Toronto.

25:37.609 --> 25:39.209
<i>He's six foot tall,</i>

25:39.210 --> 25:41.345
<i>brown hair, hazel eyes</i>

25:41.346 --> 25:42.546
<i>and he may</i>

25:42.547 --> 25:45.182
<i>be in possession of a guitar.</i>

25:46.885 --> 25:49.687
He travelled to Algonquin Bay by bus.

25:49.688 --> 25:51.755
<i>He arrived the night before last.</i>

25:51.756 --> 25:53.057
How do they know about him?

25:53.058 --> 25:54.291
Shhh.

25:54.292 --> 25:56.260
<i>Anyone who might have spoken to,</i>

25:56.261 --> 25:58.128
might have seen Keith Russell London

25:58.129 --> 25:59.429
is urged to come forward

26:00.365 --> 26:01.665
<i>and contact us.</i>

26:07.539 --> 26:09.073
Keith's mother,

26:09.074 --> 26:10.407
Melissa London,

26:10.408 --> 26:12.109
would now like to say a few words.

26:21.319 --> 26:23.253
I am Keith's mom

26:24.289 --> 26:25.589
and I...

26:27.092 --> 26:28.392
Tell them about your son,

26:28.560 --> 26:29.860
<i>Mrs. London.</i>

26:33.732 --> 26:35.232
He's a good young man.

26:37.302 --> 26:38.602
He's a bright,

26:40.138 --> 26:42.272
<i>loving young man</i>

26:43.942 --> 26:45.409
<i>and we, we-</i>

26:45.410 --> 26:47.544
Tell them how you wanted
him to come home.

26:50.915 --> 26:53.216
He wanted to travel more.

26:58.857 --> 27:01.525
But I just wanted my boy to come home.

27:03.361 --> 27:04.661
Thank you, Mrs. London.

27:05.029 --> 27:06.409
We have no further comment.

27:10.668 --> 27:12.261
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

27:12.262 --> 27:13.863
<i>You don't think this woman
is going through enough?</i>

27:13.864 --> 27:15.806
The killer gets off
on his victim's pain.

27:15.807 --> 27:17.007
Now he gets to

27:17.008 --> 27:18.008
toy with the family too.

27:18.009 --> 27:19.309
<i>Well how good of you</i>

27:19.310 --> 27:21.090
to provide him with that opportunity.

27:22.313 --> 27:23.313
Did you know about this?

27:23.314 --> 27:24.681
No. It was my call.

27:24.682 --> 27:25.949
<i>This is new ground for him.</i>

27:25.950 --> 27:26.950
<i>He'll savour it.</i>

27:26.951 --> 27:28.251
It buys us time

27:29.220 --> 27:30.220
and if I'd asked

27:30.221 --> 27:31.974
you wouldn't have let
me bring her on stage.

27:31.975 --> 27:33.598
<i>You're damn
right I wouldn't have.</i>

27:33.599 --> 27:35.893
Because you just might have
given this guy the climax

27:35.894 --> 27:37.194
that he was after

27:38.196 --> 27:40.016
<i>and now he's gonna finish the kid off.</i>

27:53.511 --> 27:54.811
We can share this.

27:57.749 --> 27:59.609
You don't have to
carry the whole thing.

28:08.493 --> 28:09.793
Your parents are in town.

28:10.061 --> 28:11.361
How do you know that?

28:12.597 --> 28:14.331
I saw your mom on TV just now.

28:15.099 --> 28:16.833
She's not holding up very well.

28:18.570 --> 28:19.870
What did she say?

28:20.004 --> 28:21.905
Kind of hard to make out the words.

28:29.547 --> 28:31.681
Just please tell me
why you're doing this.

28:34.719 --> 28:36.019
Tell him, Edie.

28:41.426 --> 28:42.726
We don't ask why.

28:46.698 --> 28:47.798
<i>Is there anything</i>

28:47.799 --> 28:49.299
<i>you want to tell your parents?</i>

28:52.604 --> 28:53.770
What do you mean?

28:53.771 --> 28:55.071
Like if you,

28:55.240 --> 28:56.780
like if you could talk to them.

28:57.242 --> 28:58.542
What would you say?

29:03.481 --> 29:05.015
Would you say you love them?

29:17.495 --> 29:19.075
<i>We're gonna give them something!</i>

29:20.131 --> 29:21.711
We're gonna give them a message.

29:23.301 --> 29:24.601
<i>Give it some thought.</i>

29:26.804 --> 29:28.572
I'm not gonna let you torture them.

29:28.573 --> 29:29.873
It's too late for that.

29:29.941 --> 29:32.075
Well I'm not gonna help
you make them suffer.

29:35.079 --> 29:36.847
<i>We're either gonna
send them a message</i>

29:36.848 --> 29:38.749
or we're gonna send them a piece.

29:38.750 --> 29:41.652
<i>What would be better?</i>

29:41.653 --> 29:43.820
A chunk of Keith?

29:47.458 --> 29:48.458
<i>Keith?</i>

30:09.781 --> 30:11.081
So just come up

30:11.649 --> 30:13.669
with those thoughtful
little words of yours.

30:15.987 --> 30:17.327
<i>You should be happy.</i>

30:18.890 --> 30:22.065
You were gonna die tonight.

30:36.027 --> 30:37.447
<i>What about the police?</i>

30:37.762 --> 30:39.062
You saw them.

30:39.964 --> 30:41.264
They're nowhere.

30:43.434 --> 30:46.103
If Detective John Cardinal
had the first clue about us,

30:46.104 --> 30:48.238
he would have knocked
down our door already.

30:50.608 --> 30:52.042
Do you think he liked being on TV?

30:52.043 --> 30:53.276
What, the detective?

30:53.277 --> 30:55.612
Yeah, most of them like it,

30:55.613 --> 30:57.273
even when they pretend they don't.

30:58.549 --> 30:59.849
I couldn't tell with him.

31:16.334 --> 31:17.634
What are you doing?

31:19.737 --> 31:21.037
<i>Come on.</i>

31:21.105 --> 31:22.605
<i>Take up some space with me.</i>

31:25.176 --> 31:26.176
<i>You're ridiculous.</i>

31:26.177 --> 31:27.477
<i>Yeah?</i>

31:27.645 --> 31:28.945
<i>You ever tried it?</i>

31:31.849 --> 31:33.149
<i>Come on.</i>

31:33.851 --> 31:35.151
<i>Come out here.</i>

31:48.466 --> 31:49.766
Spread your legs.

31:52.103 --> 31:53.403
Put your arms out.

31:55.673 --> 31:56.973
Take a deep breath.

32:16.527 --> 32:19.296
<i>Yeah. Serial
numbers from six different bills,</i>

32:19.297 --> 32:20.597
<i>all fifties.</i>

32:20.859 --> 32:22.159
I'll get you back.

32:26.298 --> 32:27.598
Be careful.

32:31.837 --> 32:33.137
What does that mean?

32:35.307 --> 32:38.175
You're young and hungry

32:38.176 --> 32:39.476
and you're good.

32:41.813 --> 32:43.114
Sometimes the reward for that

32:43.115 --> 32:44.615
can be cases you can't win.

32:48.987 --> 32:51.889
If this is nothing,

32:51.890 --> 32:54.024
no one will be more relieved than me.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.140
<i>Who's there?</i>

33:12.377 --> 33:13.677
<i>Josh?</i>

33:14.379 --> 33:15.879
<i>Ha, John Cardinal.</i>

33:18.650 --> 33:20.150
<i>Can we talk? We need to talk.</i>

33:22.387 --> 33:23.687
We had a thing tonight.

33:26.258 --> 33:27.558
I cooked.

33:28.260 --> 33:29.927
<i>And she promised she'd be there</i>

33:29.928 --> 33:31.462
<i>and then she didn't turn up.</i>

33:32.831 --> 33:34.451
<i>She has a lot going on.</i>

33:34.666 --> 33:35.966
<i>I know.</i>

33:36.668 --> 33:38.569
No one's work is as important as yours,

33:38.570 --> 33:39.870
<i>God knows.</i>

33:41.540 --> 33:44.241
Which is sort of the point.
Why did she promise to come?

33:45.844 --> 33:46.844
To your dinner?

33:46.845 --> 33:48.145
<i>To my dinner.</i>

33:49.581 --> 33:52.316
Knowing how busy she is.
It's like she set it up to fail.

33:58.890 --> 34:00.390
We're trying to have a kid.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.393
<i>She tell you that?</i>

34:02.394 --> 34:03.774
That's none of my business.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.197
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

34:06.198 --> 34:08.065
here's something detective-y for ya.

34:08.065 --> 34:09.934
I was searching for
her cigarette stash,

34:09.935 --> 34:11.302
I know she's smoking again,

34:11.303 --> 34:14.138
<i>which I'm thinking
it's not cool, right,</i>

34:14.139 --> 34:15.139
<i>for the baby but,</i>

34:15.139 --> 34:16.607
the joke's on me because

34:16.608 --> 34:18.742
I didn't find any cigarettes,
I found these.

34:22.047 --> 34:23.147
You're drunk.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.882
You want to think about
what you're doing.

34:24.882 --> 34:26.382
Are you two having an affair?

34:30.554 --> 34:32.456
No. Right.

34:36.561 --> 34:38.596
To be honest, I half hoped you were

34:38.597 --> 34:40.664
because if this isn't
about another guy,

34:40.665 --> 34:42.399
I don't know what to make of it.

34:43.264 --> 34:44.768
<i>She says things will return to normal</i>

34:44.768 --> 34:46.070
<i>when she's back in Financial,</i>

34:46.071 --> 34:48.205
<i>but I don't know how you
come back from this.</i>

34:49.241 --> 34:51.609
What do you mean when
she's back in Financial?

34:51.610 --> 34:53.811
<i>The transfer to
CIS, it's temporary.</i>

34:53.812 --> 34:54.812
It's some assignment.

34:54.813 --> 34:56.112
You didn't know that?

34:57.315 --> 34:58.615
<i>Where is she anyway?</i>

34:59.251 --> 35:00.651
<i>If her case is so full on,</i>

35:00.652 --> 35:01.952
<i>why aren't you with her?</i>

35:06.424 --> 35:07.925
I don't feel very good.

35:09.527 --> 35:10.827
<i>- Hannam?
- Yeah.</i>

35:12.097 --> 35:13.597
Can you run some bills for me?

35:14.332 --> 35:15.432
On Katie Pine?

35:15.433 --> 35:16.767
Nah, it's a different thing.

35:16.768 --> 35:18.102
I need to know if this money

35:18.103 --> 35:20.237
is associated with any
criminal activity.

35:30.115 --> 35:31.455
Nope. These are new bills.

35:32.851 --> 35:34.151
But they can't be.

35:34.519 --> 35:35.886
Look at the issue dates.

35:35.887 --> 35:36.887
That's fresh money,

35:36.888 --> 35:38.188
straight from the bank.

35:38.990 --> 35:40.924
Someone laundered this money.

35:41.459 --> 35:43.039
Why would you launder new bills?

35:53.738 --> 35:55.038
<i>Hey.</i>

35:55.707 --> 35:57.007
Hey.

35:57.509 --> 35:58.809
I ran into Josh.

35:59.544 --> 36:00.944
He's had a bit to drink.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.349
<i>Managed to get him in
the door before the</i>

36:05.350 --> 36:06.650
barfing started.

36:07.719 --> 36:09.019
<i>But he's fine now.</i>

36:12.891 --> 36:14.191
You cleaned up.

36:14.893 --> 36:16.233
It's done. It was nothing.

36:17.562 --> 36:19.696
It was fluids mostly.

36:22.567 --> 36:24.067
Where did you run into him?

36:25.537 --> 36:26.837
In a bar.

36:29.407 --> 36:31.008
You could have called me. I would have-

36:31.009 --> 36:32.309
I didn't want to

36:32.610 --> 36:34.270
interrupt whatever you were doing.

36:39.918 --> 36:42.219
I-I was just catching up on paperwork.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.594
Thank you.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.596
Yeah.

37:03.582 --> 37:05.082
I know a lot of people,

37:05.985 --> 37:07.819
they don't approve of what I do.

37:09.154 --> 37:11.014
You can't listen to
that though, I mean,

37:11.190 --> 37:13.591
you can't do this job
without a thick skin, right?

37:13.592 --> 37:14.592
And you know what?

37:14.593 --> 37:16.093
Those people are just...

37:17.556 --> 37:18.859
<i>you know, they're envious of me.</i>

37:18.860 --> 37:20.160
<i>They um...</i>

38:05.544 --> 38:07.044
<i>Hello?</i>

38:09.581 --> 38:11.115
Hel-lo!

38:42.214 --> 38:43.614
<i>Bingo.</i>

39:08.240 --> 39:09.463
<i>Okay, okay, okay, okay.</i>

39:09.464 --> 39:10.875
<i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

39:10.876 --> 39:12.376
<i>Shh-shh-shh.</i>

39:16.115 --> 39:17.415
<i>Please be quiet.</i>

39:17.416 --> 39:18.716
Let's be quiet now.

39:19.442 --> 39:20.865
- Shh-shh-shh.
- Untie me! Untie me!

39:20.866 --> 39:22.369
- Okay.
- My God. Before they come.

39:22.370 --> 39:24.088
There's a woman upstairs
sleeping upstairs.

39:24.089 --> 39:26.223
- Unite me. Untie me.
- Be quiet.

39:28.994 --> 39:31.017
- Please! Please! Please!
- You gotta be quiet now.

39:33.799 --> 39:35.066
<i>Please hurry!</i>

39:35.067 --> 39:36.601
<i>Please hurry. Hurry.</i>

39:42.808 --> 39:43.808
Shut up.

39:43.809 --> 39:44.809
Or I'm out.

39:55.420 --> 39:57.355
Shh-shh.

40:04.129 --> 40:07.264
<i>Okay, so, let's,</i>

40:08.767 --> 40:10.067
let's just be calm.

40:14.506 --> 40:17.008
<i>No need-no need for anybody to</i>

40:17.009 --> 40:18.009
<i>freak out here.</i>

40:19.478 --> 40:20.611
Stop.

40:20.612 --> 40:21.612
<i>Okay.</i>

40:21.613 --> 40:22.913
Okay.

40:23.215 --> 40:24.448
Who are you?

40:24.449 --> 40:25.516
How'd you find us?

40:25.517 --> 40:26.817
I didn't,

40:26.885 --> 40:28.419
I didn't find you...

40:30.289 --> 40:32.523
Let's just take a breath here, okay?

40:32.524 --> 40:33.691
Shoot him.

40:33.692 --> 40:34.992
No, no. No, no. I-I...

40:36.461 --> 40:38.162
<i>I picked the wrong house.</i>

40:38.163 --> 40:39.586
Okay? That's what's happening here.

40:39.587 --> 40:41.321
I-I came for the guitar.

40:41.322 --> 40:43.211
Eric, you have to shoot him!

40:45.003 --> 40:46.303
You're a burglar?

40:50.676 --> 40:52.159
Well done, burglar.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.094
Jackpot.

40:53.095 --> 40:54.295
Shoot him!

40:54.296 --> 40:56.597
I got a lookout waiting
outside in the car.

41:01.503 --> 41:02.503
<i>He's waiting for me.</i>

41:02.504 --> 41:03.804
<i>If you fire the gun,</i>

41:04.740 --> 41:06.040
<i>he hears it.</i>

41:07.109 --> 41:08.409
You're lying.

41:08.477 --> 41:09.477
What's his name?

41:09.478 --> 41:10.611
Aiden.

41:10.612 --> 41:11.912
It's Aiden.

41:11.913 --> 41:14.181
You know how I know you're
not telling the truth?

41:34.269 --> 41:35.769
I swear I will kill her.

41:37.339 --> 41:38.839
There's no one outside, Keith.

41:39.641 --> 41:40.941
You know how I know?

41:41.810 --> 41:43.778
"I picked the wrong house"

41:43.779 --> 41:44.945
<i>and then he switched.</i>

41:44.946 --> 41:46.013
<i>Then he switched to 'we'.</i>

41:46.014 --> 41:48.616
<i>But there is no 'we' Keith,
so I can shoot</i>

41:48.617 --> 41:49.917
and no one will hear.

41:50.819 --> 41:52.119
<i>I swear.</i>

41:52.220 --> 41:53.954
Move back or I'll kill her.

41:54.790 --> 41:57.158
<i>I wonder if you've got the
strength to do that, Keith.</i>

41:57.159 --> 41:58.459
In your state?

41:59.027 --> 42:01.729
To push that screwdriver
through her neck?

42:01.730 --> 42:03.150
<i>It's tougher than you think,</i>

42:03.365 --> 42:04.365
flesh is.
