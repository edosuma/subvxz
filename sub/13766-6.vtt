WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.963
PHOTOGRAPHER: Squeeze in.

00:02.085 --> 00:03.963
Little closer together.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.506
Chins up like baby

00:04.004 --> 00:05.506
birds. Lovely.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.048
MALCOLM: Move.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.048
REESE: Shut up.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.050
MALCOLM: Stop touching me.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.050
REESE: I'm not touching you.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.052
I was clipping

00:09.092 --> 00:11.052
on my tie.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.052
While you were

00:09.092 --> 00:11.052
touching me.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.054
Stop it.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.054
Why do we have

00:11.094 --> 00:13.054
to do this?

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
Because we don't have a single

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
picture of us all together.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.892
That's ridiculous.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.936
We're a family-- we should have

00:16.934 --> 00:18.936
a family portrait.

00:18.978 --> 00:20.729
Well, Francis

00:18.978 --> 00:20.729
isn't here.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.690
Well, I'm not gonna cough up

00:20.771 --> 00:22.690
200 bucks to fly him in

00:22.731 --> 00:24.065
for one silly picture.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.275
Where's Dewey?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.154
Dewey, get out of there--

00:27.027 --> 00:29.154
that's not your family.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.072
You sure you want "autumn

00:29.196 --> 00:31.072
leaves" as a backdrop?

00:31.114 --> 00:32.533
Yes.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.535
You didn't even look

00:32.574 --> 00:34.535
at "happy windmills."

00:34.576 --> 00:37.329
It's more colorful.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.080
"Space shuttle."

00:37.371 --> 00:39.080
PHOTOGRAPHER: Next.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.041
Come on, let's go.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.337
I have a coupon here for one

00:42.751 --> 00:45.337
eight-by-ten and two wallet size

00:45.379 --> 00:48.089
for $9.99, and

00:45.379 --> 00:48.089
that's what I want.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.884
I don't want the "golden

00:48.131 --> 00:49.884
moments" collection.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.259
I don't want the "family

00:49.925 --> 00:51.259
and friends" collection.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.094
I don't want the

00:51.301 --> 00:53.094
"lifetime of love."

00:53.136 --> 00:56.097
I want one eight-by-ten and

00:53.136 --> 00:56.097
two wallet size for $9.99.

00:56.139 --> 00:59.685
Fine. We have an installment

00:56.139 --> 00:59.685
plan if that would help.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.102
I brought a picture

00:59.727 --> 01:01.102
of Francis.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.688
He's gonna be

01:01.144 --> 01:02.688
in the portrait.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.688
Cool.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.481
I'll hold it.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.481
No, I'm gonna

01:02.730 --> 01:04.481
hold it.

01:04.523 --> 01:05.983
Let go.

01:04.523 --> 01:05.983
I'm gonna hold it.

01:04.523 --> 01:05.983
Come on.

01:06.025 --> 01:09.110
Dewey, pants on, mister.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.739
I'm sorry, but this

01:09.152 --> 01:11.739
coupon's expired.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.739
What?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.532
It's expired.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.409
What you want will

01:13.574 --> 01:15.409
run you $39.50.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.409
Ooh, "lonely beach."

01:15.450 --> 01:18.328
We're kind of the "lonely

01:15.450 --> 01:18.328
beach" family, right?

01:15.450 --> 01:18.328
Hal.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.998
But for another $5.00, you can

01:18.370 --> 01:20.998
have the instant memory set.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.290
That comes with double

01:21.040 --> 01:22.290
exposure silhouettes

01:22.332 --> 01:24.125
for the grandparents.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.962
Look, could you please just do

01:24.167 --> 01:26.962
what I'm asking you to...

01:27.004 --> 01:28.923
I'm older!

01:27.004 --> 01:28.923
It was my idea!

01:28.964 --> 01:30.966
(both growling)

01:32.426 --> 01:34.386
That is it!

01:34.428 --> 01:35.971
Get up!

01:36.013 --> 01:36.931
Get back!

01:36.972 --> 01:37.973
Come here!

01:38.015 --> 01:39.433
Go there!

01:39.474 --> 01:40.976
Okay.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.227
We are gonna take

01:41.018 --> 01:42.227
this picture,

01:42.269 --> 01:43.395
and it is gonna be good.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.980
And that means no faces,

01:45.022 --> 01:46.147
no tongues,

01:46.189 --> 01:48.358
no crossed eyes,

01:46.189 --> 01:48.358
no bunny ears.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.651
We are gonna smile.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.152
We are gonna look good.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.571
It is gonna

01:51.194 --> 01:52.571
cost us $9.99.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.406
And all of this is

01:52.613 --> 01:54.406
gonna happen

01:54.448 --> 01:55.866
by the time

01:54.448 --> 01:55.866
I count to three.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.492
(all arguing)

01:55.908 --> 01:57.492
One, two, three.

(phone ringing)

02:42.162 --> 02:44.205
Hello.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.415
(breathing heavily)

02:45.457 --> 02:47.001
Hello?

02:47.042 --> 02:48.794
(heavy breathing continues)

02:48.836 --> 02:50.587
Listen, pervert, this is

02:48.836 --> 02:50.587
the third time you've called,

02:50.629 --> 02:52.380
and I have just about had it...

02:52.422 --> 02:53.674
STEVIE:

02:52.422 --> 02:53.674
Is Malcolm...

02:53.715 --> 02:55.300
there?

02:55.342 --> 02:56.802
Oh. Hi, Stevie.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.303
Sorry, uh...

02:58.345 --> 02:59.304
Malcolm, phone!

02:59.346 --> 03:01.473
Hey, Stevie.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.267
You're coming... tonight?

03:04.309 --> 03:05.602
Yeah.

03:05.644 --> 03:08.313
And sleeping... over?

03:08.355 --> 03:10.231
It's a sleepover, Stevie--

03:08.355 --> 03:10.231
that's what you do.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.192
I'm just... excited.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.490
Never... had one.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.867
We can...

03:19.908 --> 03:21.910
read comics...

03:21.952 --> 03:24.245
and build...

03:24.287 --> 03:26.707
models.

03:26.748 --> 03:31.252
Stevie, I never thought I'd

03:26.748 --> 03:31.252
say this, but slow down.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.339
Ha... ha.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.258
Forty-one.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.260
Forty-two.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.554
Forty-three.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.305
Okay, stop,

03:40.595 --> 03:42.305
I can't do anymore.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.932
You think later on,

03:42.347 --> 03:43.932
you can manage to stand

03:43.974 --> 03:45.976
on my stomach

03:43.974 --> 03:45.976
while I do sit-ups?

03:46.018 --> 03:48.228
Ugh, just give me

03:46.018 --> 03:48.228
a minute, okay?

03:57.738 --> 04:00.074
Finley, what are you doing

03:57.738 --> 04:00.074
in the cupboard?

04:00.115 --> 04:03.284
Poquito cabeza.

04:00.115 --> 04:03.284
Get out of there, man.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.205
I can't-- I've been marked by

04:03.326 --> 04:06.205
the brothers of the apocalypse.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.207
Poquito cabeza.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.457
Brothers of the apocalypse?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.210
It's ridiculous.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.294
It's five seniors

04:11.251 --> 04:13.294
with limited imaginations.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.796
Oh, yeah, that's

04:13.336 --> 04:14.796
easy for you to say.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.798
You've got Stanley

04:14.838 --> 04:16.798
protecting you.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.467
And you're not holding

04:16.840 --> 04:19.467
poquito cabeza.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.928
Would you stop saying

04:19.509 --> 04:20.928
poquito cabeza?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.137
I can't.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.098
And I'm not

04:22.179 --> 04:24.098
coming out.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.600
Oh, could you turn

04:24.139 --> 04:26.600
in my math homework?

04:29.728 --> 04:31.312
These guys are so lame.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.522
Amateurs.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.274
Poor Finley.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.318
He's good at math, right?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.320
MEN (chanting):

04:37.360 --> 04:39.320
Finley, boom-ba-yay,

04:39.362 --> 04:42.323
Finley,

04:39.362 --> 04:42.323
boom-ba-yay,

04:42.365 --> 04:44.409
Finley, boom-ba-yay,

04:44.451 --> 04:46.327
Finley, boom-ba-yay...

04:46.369 --> 04:48.205
No!

04:48.247 --> 04:49.539
Finley,

04:48.247 --> 04:49.539
boom-ba-yay,

04:48.247 --> 04:49.539
No! No, please!

04:49.581 --> 04:52.375
Finley, boom-ba-yay,

04:49.581 --> 04:52.375
Somebody help me. No.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.794
Finley, boom-ba-yay,

04:52.417 --> 04:53.794
Finley, boom...

04:52.417 --> 04:53.794
Please, no.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.337
Some... Somebody.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.337
Stop.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.590
Froot Loops.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.597
Finley, boom-ba-yay,

05:03.762 --> 05:05.597
Oh, please, please.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.391
Finley, boom-ba-yay,

05:05.639 --> 05:08.391
Help me! Help me!

05:08.433 --> 05:10.310
Finley, boom-ba-yay...

05:08.433 --> 05:10.310
No...!

05:11.895 --> 05:13.396
Hey, Mom, I'm going to Stevie's.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.982
LOIS:

05:13.438 --> 05:14.982
You be nice to that boy.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.191
He can't walk.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.651
If he's got to go

05:16.233 --> 05:17.651
to the bathroom

05:17.692 --> 05:19.611
in the middle of the night,

05:17.692 --> 05:19.611
you get up and you help him.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.364
Yes! There's a  Chucky

05:21.071 --> 05:23.364
movie on tonight.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.075
Not in this house.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.619
You know how your father feels

05:25.117 --> 05:27.619
about evil puppet movies.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.954
Please, Mom.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.080
It's not even

05:28.996 --> 05:30.080
a school night.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.372
I can stay up.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.373
You really think

05:31.414 --> 05:32.373
you're old enough?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.001
I totally am.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.377
Well, if you

05:34.042 --> 05:36.377
really think so.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.629
Aw, Mom, no fair.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.173
What's the matter?

05:39.214 --> 05:41.258
Afraid you can't

05:39.214 --> 05:41.258
beat your mommy?

05:41.300 --> 05:44.636
She's just a person,

05:41.300 --> 05:44.636
she's just a person.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.019
(feigning fear):

05:50.809 --> 05:52.019
Oh, no.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.395
He's finally

05:52.060 --> 05:54.395
going to win.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.814
What's he playing

05:54.437 --> 05:55.814
for tonight?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.482
Bedtime and a

05:55.856 --> 05:57.482
Chucky  movie.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.109
Stop screwing around

05:57.524 --> 05:59.109
and pin him.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.700
Oh, you'll have to forgive

06:03.446 --> 06:06.700
the mess, Malcolm.

06:06.741 --> 06:10.411
Mmm, when our Stevie enters a

06:06.741 --> 06:10.411
room, it's like a typhoon hit.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.454
(chuckling)

06:16.168 --> 06:19.504
Well, uh, we'll

06:16.168 --> 06:19.504
leave you alone.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.886
Check it out, Stevie.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.680
The T. rex is three feet

06:25.927 --> 06:28.680
tall with a movable jaw.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.432
Red paint for blood.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.268
This is so cool.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.936
I heard screaming.

06:34.978 --> 06:35.937
Yeah.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.647
I said, "This

06:35.979 --> 06:37.647
is so cool."

06:37.689 --> 06:39.440
Is that a switchblade?

06:39.482 --> 06:40.483
It's an

06:39.482 --> 06:40.483
X-Acto knife.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.902
To cut the pieces apart.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.278
I use it all the time.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.445
KITTY:

06:43.320 --> 06:44.445
Oh, my goodness.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.989
Well, we'll lock this up

06:44.487 --> 06:45.989
with the scissors.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.326
How about a puzzle?

06:50.577 --> 06:52.037
Stevie, it's been a long time

06:52.079 --> 06:53.914
since you did

06:52.079 --> 06:53.914
the Arc de Triomphe.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.499
We'll just give that back

06:53.955 --> 06:56.499
when you go home.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.755
Hmm.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.632
Puzzles are... fun.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.468
You think we can

07:04.674 --> 07:07.468
order some pizza?

07:07.510 --> 07:10.555
Mom's... making...

07:07.510 --> 07:10.555
pizza.

07:10.597 --> 07:14.101
Cheeseless...

07:10.597 --> 07:14.101
sauceless... pizza.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.977
That's just bread.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.230
Pizza... bread.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.779
Wise  poquito cabeza.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.198
Who shall your next victim be?

07:28.240 --> 07:31.492
I am so sick

07:28.240 --> 07:31.492
of these guys.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.493
What's that?

07:32.535 --> 07:33.995
You're not sure?

07:46.258 --> 07:48.218
I think we have a winner.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.930
You are cordially invited

07:51.972 --> 07:53.514
to attend...

07:53.556 --> 07:55.516
Hey!

07:55.558 --> 07:57.227
I don't have a

07:55.558 --> 07:57.227
problem with you.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.020
(clears throat)

07:59.062 --> 08:00.105
Francis.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.522
Look, Stevenson,

08:01.564 --> 08:03.733
this place is

08:01.564 --> 08:03.733
horrible enough,

08:03.775 --> 08:07.612
so the  poquito cabeza

08:03.775 --> 08:07.612
thing stops now, okay?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.697
Just stop...

08:09.739 --> 08:10.740
Just stop.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.826
Just stop packing.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.829
You were

08:13.868 --> 08:15.829
protecting me.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.831
I mean, I know we don't have,

08:15.870 --> 08:17.831
like, a formal agreement

08:17.872 --> 08:19.833
or anything, but my act

08:17.872 --> 08:19.833
of courage was kind of dependent

08:19.874 --> 08:22.002
on your role

08:19.874 --> 08:22.002
as my bodyguard.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.212
I'm sorry, Francis.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.212
You're sorry?

08:24.254 --> 08:27.632
Do you have any idea what

08:24.254 --> 08:27.632
these guys are gonna do to me?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.550
Four words.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.552
Nana has a fever.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.013
End of discussion.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.555
So what am I

08:33.054 --> 08:34.555
supposed to do?

08:34.597 --> 08:36.557
Remember that move

08:34.597 --> 08:36.557
I taught you?

08:36.599 --> 08:39.436
Yeah.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.436
Don't even try it.

08:39.478 --> 08:44.441
MEN (chanting):

08:39.478 --> 08:44.441
Francis, boom-ba-yay,

08:44.483 --> 08:45.566
Francis, boom-ba-yay...

08:45.608 --> 08:50.571
Have to admit--

08:45.608 --> 08:50.571
it's kind of catchy.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.866
...Francis, boom-ba-yay.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.243
Did you have fun

08:52.907 --> 08:55.243
tonight, Malcolm?

08:55.285 --> 08:57.954
Yeah, I guess.

08:57.996 --> 09:01.291
But isn't it kind of early

08:57.996 --> 09:01.291
to be going to bed?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.792
It's not even 8:00.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.294
Oh, don't worry,

09:02.834 --> 09:04.294
that jigsaw puzzle

09:04.336 --> 09:05.879
will still be there

09:04.336 --> 09:05.879
in the morning.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.965
Now, I know you boys want to do

09:09.007 --> 09:11.801
a little chatting

09:09.007 --> 09:11.801
before sleepy time.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.888
Let's say four minutes.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.060
Mrs. Kenarban can

09:18.058 --> 09:20.060
be a tad strict.

09:20.101 --> 09:23.063
She doesn't know that sometimes

09:20.101 --> 09:23.063
boys have to be boys.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.106
Am I right?

09:37.035 --> 09:38.995
I can't move.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.915
Welcome to...

09:39.037 --> 09:41.915
the club.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.500
I'm never gonna

09:41.956 --> 09:43.500
fall asleep.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.001
It's too early.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.795
Want to tell...

09:45.043 --> 09:47.795
ghost stories?

09:47.837 --> 09:50.631
No, I want to do

09:47.837 --> 09:50.631
that dinosaur model.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.633
(grunts)

09:52.675 --> 09:54.594
(alarm gently sounds)

09:56.679 --> 09:58.139
KITTY:

09:56.679 --> 09:58.139
Everything all right

09:56.679 --> 09:58.139
in there, boys?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.102
Um, yeah.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.811
A plush toy just fell

10:02.143 --> 10:03.811
on the floor.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.355
We're fine.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.943
(gasps)

10:07.690 --> 10:09.943
You... can't.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.236
I just did.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.653
Your parents need

10:11.278 --> 10:12.653
to cut you some slack.

10:12.695 --> 10:16.491
They just...

10:12.695 --> 10:16.491
want me... safe.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.243
No, they want you

10:16.533 --> 10:18.243
to be four.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.703
Stevie, parents aren't allowed

10:18.285 --> 10:20.703
to control everything you do.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.623
(bell dings)

10:20.745 --> 10:23.623
Sometimes,

10:20.745 --> 10:23.623
you just have...

10:25.375 --> 10:26.667
Sorry.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.253
Conditioning.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.254
Come on.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.671
I got an idea.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.632
We're gonna get you

10:30.713 --> 10:32.632
out of here.

10:34.717 --> 10:35.927
Don't.

10:35.969 --> 10:36.970
It's alarmed.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.266
You got me?

10:39.722 --> 10:41.266
Yeah.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.267
You got me?

10:42.309 --> 10:43.935
No.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.565
I didn't know...

10:45.937 --> 10:48.565
you cared.

10:52.944 --> 10:53.945
Okay.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.697
You want maturity?

10:56.739 --> 10:58.575
Well, here's three weeks

10:56.739 --> 10:58.575
of social studies homework.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.285
Now I'm one week ahead.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.786
Plus, I called Grandma.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.704
GRANDMA: Hello.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.704
REESE: Hi, Grandma, it's Reese.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.582
Who is this? Reese.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.582
Grandma, it-it's Reese.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.626
Who's Reese?

11:05.624 --> 11:07.626
Grandma, it's Reese.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.419
No, I won't accept charges.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.419
It's Reese.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.712
I'm trying to sleep.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.712
Grandma, come on, it's Reese.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.131
I'm very tired, please.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.131
Grandma...

11:13.173 --> 11:15.300
It goes on like that

11:13.173 --> 11:15.300
for another ten minutes,

11:15.342 --> 11:17.135
but I still want credit.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.720
Honey, I'm very proud of you,

11:17.177 --> 11:19.720
but you still haven't proven

11:19.762 --> 11:21.722
you're old enough

11:19.762 --> 11:21.722
to extend your bedtime.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.600
Come on, Mom, I'll do anything.

11:23.642 --> 11:24.601
All right.

11:24.643 --> 11:25.768
Tell you what.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.686
You can stay up and watch

11:25.810 --> 11:27.686
the movie, if...

11:30.357 --> 11:31.608
...you put Dewey

11:30.357 --> 11:31.608
to bed.

11:31.650 --> 11:32.733
Oh.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.152
Anything else.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.736
That's the deal.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.738
You give him his bath,

11:35.778 --> 11:37.738
you put him in his PJs,

11:37.780 --> 11:38.739
you read him a story.

11:38.781 --> 11:39.740
Lois, have a heart.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.201
Hey, take it

11:39.782 --> 11:41.201
or leave it.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.952
I'll take it.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.996
(chair scrapes)

11:46.373 --> 11:47.832
Come on, Dewey!

11:47.874 --> 11:49.250
It's bath time!

11:49.292 --> 11:51.752
You know he doesn't

11:49.292 --> 11:51.752
stand a chance.

11:51.794 --> 11:55.215
(Dewey screams)

11:51.794 --> 11:55.215
I know, but at least it'll give

11:51.794 --> 11:55.215
us the night to be alone.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.175
Oh.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.260
I love the way

11:57.217 --> 11:59.260
your mind works.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.642
Honk.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.977
(chuckles)

12:08.019 --> 12:10.647
Smoothie.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.735
I'm... winning.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.616
I... lost.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.451
Yes.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.496
I got... another

12:23.493 --> 12:26.496
quarter... in my chair.

12:43.762 --> 12:44.805
Somebody stole my

12:43.762 --> 12:44.805
friend's wheelchair.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.807
What's it look like?

12:46.849 --> 12:49.310
It's a chair

12:46.849 --> 12:49.310
with wheels.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.236
I'll go get a form.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.321
I don't need a form,

12:58.278 --> 13:00.321
I need a wheelchair.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.036
Hey!

13:07.078 --> 13:08.037
Come back!

13:08.079 --> 13:09.830
I'm not kidding!

13:09.872 --> 13:11.625
This ain't funny!

13:11.666 --> 13:13.710
(grunts)

13:15.044 --> 13:17.046
I'll get another chair.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.011
I'm... screwed.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.472
You're not screwed.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.889
We just got to

13:25.513 --> 13:26.889
get you home.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.725
We'll deal with

13:26.931 --> 13:28.725
everything else...

13:32.895 --> 13:35.523
What are we going

13:32.895 --> 13:35.523
to do now?

13:35.565 --> 13:37.858
Carry me... like...

13:37.900 --> 13:39.818
a backpack.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.750
Stop! Stop!

13:53.792 --> 13:55.834
Gonna... puke.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.546
DEWEY:

13:56.919 --> 13:58.546
Ow! Let me go!

13:58.588 --> 13:59.880
Come on, Dewey.

13:59.922 --> 14:00.965
It's me.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.509
You like me.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.884
No, I don't.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.303
Ow.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.554
Dewey, please!

14:08.973 --> 14:10.391
How much does my head weigh?

14:11.434 --> 14:12.851
Zero.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.854
Zero.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.817
(chuckles)

14:18.857 --> 14:20.901
Hey, do you remember

14:18.857 --> 14:20.901
the last time we had

14:20.943 --> 14:22.987
a quiet moment

14:20.943 --> 14:22.987
together like this?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.905
Bob's funeral.

14:24.947 --> 14:25.906
Yeah.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.116
Oh, that was nice.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.160
And you look

14:27.158 --> 14:29.160
great in black.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.161
Aw...

14:30.203 --> 14:31.621
You do. You do.

14:31.663 --> 14:32.706
(chuckles)

14:32.747 --> 14:34.749
(phone rings)

14:36.959 --> 14:38.378
Let the machine

14:36.959 --> 14:38.378
get it.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.587
Mmm.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.921
(phone rings)

14:40.963 --> 14:42.923
(answering machine beeps)

14:42.965 --> 14:44.634
FRANCIS:

14:42.965 --> 14:44.634
Mom, Dad, hi.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.427
Listen, something's come up.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.221
Sorry about the way I sound,

14:48.262 --> 14:50.014
but I'm calling

14:48.262 --> 14:50.014
from inside a washing machine.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.600
Don't worry, I think

14:50.056 --> 14:52.600
I'll be fine as long as...

14:52.642 --> 14:54.561
Oh. Hi, guys.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.563
How's it going?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.523
Hey, hey, what are you doing

14:56.604 --> 14:58.523
with those quarters?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.523
(guys laughing)

14:58.565 --> 15:00.525
Hey, you guys,

14:58.565 --> 15:00.525
you don't want to...

15:00.567 --> 15:01.942
Hey, come on...!

15:01.984 --> 15:02.943
(dial tone)

15:02.985 --> 15:05.363
(sniffs)

15:05.405 --> 15:07.198
Morning Dew.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.991
You know

15:07.240 --> 15:08.991
all my secrets.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.991
Mm-hmm.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.952
Well, we... we've been

15:09.033 --> 15:11.952
together a long time.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.621
Ah, well, don't worry.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.039
I know all

15:13.663 --> 15:15.039
your secrets, too.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.583
No, you don't.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.958
(chuckling):

15:16.624 --> 15:17.958
Oh, yes, I do.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.002
No, I'm a man of

15:18.000 --> 15:20.002
mystery, Lois.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.962
Okay,

15:20.044 --> 15:21.962
let's hear one.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.549
Let's hear a secret.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.968
Well, it's not really a secret

15:24.591 --> 15:27.968
as much as it is a fantasy,

15:28.010 --> 15:31.472
but it's a little

15:28.010 --> 15:31.472
embarrassing, so...

15:31.514 --> 15:34.517
Well, so...

15:31.514 --> 15:34.517
whisper it in my ear.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.570
Ha-ha.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.863
(chuckles)

15:46.905 --> 15:48.155
Just kidding.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.616
Saw it in a

15:48.197 --> 15:49.616
movie once.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.409
Don't want to do

15:49.657 --> 15:51.409
that-- that's...

15:51.451 --> 15:52.452
(chuckles)

15:52.493 --> 15:53.870
Oh, God.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.872
I gotcha.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.498
We can do that.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.958
Really?

16:00.084 --> 16:01.043
Mm-hmm.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.420
(Dewey screams)

16:02.462 --> 16:03.671
REESE:

16:02.462 --> 16:03.671
Dewey, get back here!

16:03.713 --> 16:06.716
(screaming)

16:09.218 --> 16:11.679
Okay, I just have to

16:09.218 --> 16:11.679
pick up a few things.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.013
(Dewey screams)

16:11.721 --> 16:13.013
Give me 20 minutes?

16:13.055 --> 16:14.014
I'll be waiting.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.057
Yes.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.059
Honey?

16:15.099 --> 16:17.059
Huh? Huh?

16:17.101 --> 16:19.103
Honey, aren't you

16:17.101 --> 16:19.103
forgetting something?

16:21.105 --> 16:23.065
Thank you.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.651
Your car keys.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.611
REESE:

16:24.692 --> 16:26.611
Come on, Dewey, stop!

16:26.653 --> 16:28.655
Right.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.030
REESE:

16:28.696 --> 16:30.030
Stay out of the neighbor's...

16:30.072 --> 16:31.240
(woman screams)

16:35.870 --> 16:37.747
That's a nice cart.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.039
Thanks.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.583
It's new.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.420
Downtown... rocks.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.046
What's that?

16:46.088 --> 16:47.966
A stripped car.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.467
What's that?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.469
A naked man arguing

16:49.509 --> 16:51.469
with a wall.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.971
What's that?

16:53.012 --> 16:54.347
A nudie bookstore.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.017
With my dad

16:56.098 --> 16:58.017
coming out of it.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.313
(singing to himself)

17:02.355 --> 17:03.898
There you go.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.695
Daddy's gonna get

17:06.108 --> 17:08.695
some love tonight.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.197
(gong rings)

17:14.325 --> 17:16.285
STEVENSON:

17:14.325 --> 17:16.285
Perhaps you'll survive--

17:16.327 --> 17:18.120
perhaps not.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.749
Many have perished at the hands

17:18.162 --> 17:21.749
of the grand executioner.

17:23.918 --> 17:26.128
They are the

17:23.918 --> 17:26.128
lucky ones.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.255
(whispering):

17:26.170 --> 17:28.255
Are you scared?

17:28.297 --> 17:32.092
Actually, now that

17:28.297 --> 17:32.092
you mention it... no.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.928
What?

17:35.596 --> 17:37.724
Scared now?

17:37.765 --> 17:39.726
No.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.769
I'm just kind of itchy.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.730
Huh?

17:43.771 --> 17:46.691
You are hanging over

17:43.771 --> 17:46.691
a bottomless pit.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.527
In five seconds, I

17:46.733 --> 17:49.527
will cut the rope.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.111
Are you scared now?

17:51.153 --> 17:52.739
I'm really not, no.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.114
Why not?

17:54.156 --> 17:55.783
This stuff is

17:54.156 --> 17:55.783
way scary.

17:55.825 --> 17:59.537
I'm sorry, it just feels

17:55.825 --> 17:59.537
so... amateurish.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.122
I mean, I know

17:59.579 --> 18:02.122
you guys are trying,

18:02.164 --> 18:04.333
but I've been tormented

18:02.164 --> 18:04.333
by the best.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.003
Let me tell you a little bit

18:04.375 --> 18:07.003
about the master.

18:07.045 --> 18:07.962
LOIS:

18:07.045 --> 18:07.962
Traveling?!

18:08.004 --> 18:09.380
He wasn't traveling.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.131
Why don't you put your glasses

18:09.422 --> 18:11.131
on here, buddy?

18:11.173 --> 18:12.759
You're missing

18:11.173 --> 18:12.759
a great game.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.011
Oh, oh-oh, you're gonna

18:12.800 --> 18:15.011
give me a technical?!

18:15.053 --> 18:16.637
You're gonna give

18:15.053 --> 18:16.637
me  a technical?!

18:16.679 --> 18:19.139
You can't give me

18:16.679 --> 18:19.139
a technical!

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
Look at that

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
little pee-pee.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.853
Oh, Francis, I forgot

18:21.183 --> 18:23.853
how tiny you are.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.187
Oh-oh, l-l...

18:25.229 --> 18:26.647
That's the moment

18:25.229 --> 18:26.647
of his birth.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.441
You see? See him

18:26.689 --> 18:28.441
coming out feet first?

18:28.482 --> 18:32.236
Doctor said it was the biggest

18:28.482 --> 18:32.236
mucus plug they'd ever seen.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.363
It's an eight-inch scratch

18:32.278 --> 18:34.363
on the car, Francis!

18:34.405 --> 18:36.156
You know how much that's

18:34.405 --> 18:36.156
gonna cost to fix?!

18:36.198 --> 18:39.827
If you think you are ever,

18:36.198 --> 18:39.827
ever borrowing my car again,

18:39.869 --> 18:41.370
you are sadly

18:39.869 --> 18:41.370
mistaken!

18:41.412 --> 18:43.790
And I saw that

18:41.412 --> 18:43.790
tattoo, Jimmy!

18:43.831 --> 18:45.207
I'm telling your mother!

18:45.249 --> 18:49.169
And that's just the stuff

18:45.249 --> 18:49.169
I didn't block out.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.880
Oh, man.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.465
What have

18:50.922 --> 18:52.465
we been doing?

18:52.506 --> 18:54.174
This was all

18:52.506 --> 18:54.174
so wrong.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.970
We've got to stop treating

18:54.216 --> 18:56.970
people like this.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.429
Yeah.

18:58.471 --> 19:02.058
If we're gonna do this,

18:58.471 --> 19:02.058
we're gonna do it right.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.104
You will never

19:04.477 --> 19:06.104
amount to anything.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.355
Why can't you just

19:06.145 --> 19:08.355
apply yourself?

19:08.397 --> 19:10.357
Do you enjoy

19:08.397 --> 19:10.357
seeing me suffer?

19:10.399 --> 19:11.776
Is that what this is?

19:11.818 --> 19:13.611
After all that

19:11.818 --> 19:13.611
I've done for you,

19:13.653 --> 19:16.614
and this is the

19:13.653 --> 19:16.614
thanks I get?!

19:19.742 --> 19:23.203
We passed... that

19:19.742 --> 19:23.203
couch... an hour ago.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.289
I know

19:23.245 --> 19:25.289
where we're going.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.000
Oh, no, I don't.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.042
This sucks.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.377
You complain... a lot.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.212
Well, I'm sorry,

19:30.419 --> 19:32.212
but tonight hasn't exactly been

19:32.254 --> 19:33.923
the most fun

19:32.254 --> 19:33.923
in the world.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.215
Not tonight.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.676
All the time.

19:36.717 --> 19:40.138
You never...

19:36.717 --> 19:40.138
stop... bitching.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.472
Okay, great.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.265
You're gonna do

19:41.514 --> 19:43.265
this now? Fine.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.851
You were right.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.227
We shouldn't have snuck

19:44.892 --> 19:47.227
out of your house.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.229
We shouldn't have

19:47.269 --> 19:49.229
gone to the arcade.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.816
It was stupid of me for

19:49.271 --> 19:51.816
even thinking about it.

19:51.858 --> 19:52.942
It was a dumb idea.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.234
No.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.695
Good idea.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.697
Execution... sucked.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.657
(boys laughing)

19:57.738 --> 19:59.657
BOY: Yeah, do it again, man.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.241
Come on, do it.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.952
Yeah.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.871
Your chair. Hey!

20:04.912 --> 20:06.914
Oh...

20:13.921 --> 20:15.715
I'm slowing... you down.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.508
Get them... yourself.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.968
Okay.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.344
BOY:

20:19.010 --> 20:20.344
Faster, man,

20:19.010 --> 20:20.344
they're gaining on us.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.304
(groans)

20:22.346 --> 20:24.348
Come on!

20:22.346 --> 20:24.348
Get out of the chair.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.142
Oh, right.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.692
You'd better be running!

20:34.734 --> 20:36.777
Hey, Stevie, I got your...

20:44.952 --> 20:46.913
Oh, my God.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.873
Stevie, are

20:46.954 --> 20:48.873
you okay?

20:48.915 --> 20:51.959
Can't feel... my legs.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.880
That's not funny.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.715
LOIS:

20:55.922 --> 20:57.715
Is there anything I can do

20:57.757 --> 20:59.508
to get out

20:57.757 --> 20:59.508
of the ticket, Officer?

20:59.550 --> 21:00.885
HAL:

20:59.550 --> 21:00.885
Just love me.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.345
Ah, for crying out loud,

21:00.927 --> 21:03.345
Hal, is that it?

21:03.387 --> 21:05.264
Well, can't he be

21:03.387 --> 21:05.264
a sensitive cop?

21:09.060 --> 21:11.020
WOMAN:

21:09.060 --> 21:11.020
No! N-No!

21:11.062 --> 21:13.313
Th-That puppet's alive!

21:13.355 --> 21:15.357
N-No...!

21:17.610 --> 21:20.113
STEVIE:

21:17.610 --> 21:20.113
Tonight was...

21:20.154 --> 21:21.321
awesome.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.490
Well, we kind of

21:21.363 --> 21:23.490
got lucky.

21:23.532 --> 21:26.326
I was... sort of

21:23.532 --> 21:26.326
hoping... to get caught.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.162
What?

21:28.204 --> 21:30.330
Never been...

21:28.204 --> 21:30.330
in trouble.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.917
Like to see...

21:30.372 --> 21:32.917
what it's like.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.335
Sometimes you're such

21:32.959 --> 21:35.335
a Krelboyne.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.214
(police sirens whoop)

21:38.256 --> 21:41.050
KITTY:

21:38.256 --> 21:41.050
Oh! I've lost my baby! Oh...

21:41.092 --> 21:45.846
I guess... we are...

21:41.092 --> 21:45.846
in trouble... after all.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.347
Malcolm?

21:47.389 --> 21:48.933
KITTY (moaning):

21:47.389 --> 21:48.933
My boy!

21:48.975 --> 21:50.350
Malcolm...?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.350
Just find my boy.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.186
Oh, God.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.230
Malcolm?
