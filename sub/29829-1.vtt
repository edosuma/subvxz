00:52.798 --> 00:56.936
<i>This is live coverage of the
1959 24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

00:57.079 --> 00:59.610
<i>We've reached the half-way
point and so far witnessed</i>

00:59.611 --> 01:02.748
<i>Aston Martin #5
driven by Carroll Shelby</i>

01:02.749 --> 01:05.119
<i>making great games in the last hour.</i>

01:05.126 --> 01:07.978
<i>If he keeps this pace up
he could have a chance at the...</i>

01:25.586 --> 01:27.796
He's coming in. He's coming in.

01:27.797 --> 01:30.958
Let's go!

01:30.959 --> 01:33.338
I know you're tired.
Come on! Let's make it fast!

01:33.339 --> 01:35.273
Go! Go! Go!

01:37.164 --> 01:38.997
She's running a little hot.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.156
Fire!

01:41.903 --> 01:43.729
Give him blanket.

01:45.207 --> 01:47.281
Get it off me! Off!

01:48.918 --> 01:50.400
You okay?

01:52.578 --> 01:54.539
Fill the tank!

01:55.619 --> 01:58.024
- Shelby, you just...
- Am I on fire?

01:59.825 --> 02:01.648
- Am I on goddamn fire?
- No, you're not...

02:01.649 --> 02:03.892
Fill the tank!

02:05.980 --> 02:08.231
- Where am I, Eddie?
- 2 laps up by Frank.

02:08.232 --> 02:10.423
We're good. Go get them.

02:32.835 --> 02:37.168
<i>Aston Martin #5 driven by Carroll Shelby
is maintaining his lead</i>

02:37.169 --> 02:39.452
<i>as we are hearing
the final minutes of the race.</i>

02:39.453 --> 02:41.134
Shelby.

02:43.449 --> 02:45.134
<i>The crown is at their feet.</i>

02:45.305 --> 02:47.230
- Shelby.
- <i>Takes the title.</i>

02:47.231 --> 02:49.025
<i>An American wins Le Mans!</i>

02:49.026 --> 02:50.489
Shelby!

02:51.500 --> 02:53.376
- Carroll Shelby.
- What?

02:53.501 --> 02:55.767
This is something
you can't ignore anymore.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.342
I take the pills. The pills work.

02:58.965 --> 03:01.949
An elevated heart rate, say 130 BPM

03:01.950 --> 03:06.095
sustained even for a short period,
you run a critical risk of cardiac arrest.

03:06.096 --> 03:08.665
- I'll race shorter format then.
- That's not gonna work.

03:08.666 --> 03:11.435
I can race NASCAR, Formula 1.

03:11.587 --> 03:15.312
The valve is shot, Shelby.
This is as serious as it gets.

03:15.313 --> 03:18.292
In my opinion you're lucky
to be sitting here today.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.546
I feel real lucky.

03:22.568 --> 03:24.804
Luckiest guy on Earth.

03:42.374 --> 03:49.248
There's a point at 7000 RPM
where everything fades.

03:57.256 --> 04:02.437
The machine becomes weightless.
Just disappears.

04:10.288 --> 04:15.673
And all that's left is a body
moving through space and time.

04:21.202 --> 04:23.873
7000 RPM.

04:24.663 --> 04:26.979
That's where you meet it.

04:29.977 --> 04:32.510
It asks you a question.

04:32.721 --> 04:35.406
The only question that matters.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.715
"Who are you"?

04:45.941 --> 04:49.319
Now it's Von Trips in the Ferrari
coming into the corkscrew.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.566
He is breaking late,

04:52.724 --> 04:55.273
He's set a new lap record!

04:56.509 --> 04:57.770
No, you don't!

04:57.833 --> 05:00.079
A month ago this car was fun.

05:00.690 --> 05:03.748
Now, it won't even start.
And when it does it's...

05:05.883 --> 05:10.028
When I pull out of the driveway
the dog has a heart attack.

05:10.258 --> 05:13.011
All I'm asking is for you
to make it like it was.

05:13.824 --> 05:15.984
You've cocked up the inlet valves
and the cloaks...

05:16.143 --> 05:18.451
Nothing wrong with the car.
It's the way it's being driven.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.596
The way it's being driven?

05:19.597 --> 05:21.937
Too much fuel and not enough spark.
That's what's making her misfire.

05:21.961 --> 05:24.091
You wanna run that
by me in English?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.623
All right, sir.

05:30.305 --> 05:33.498
That there... That is a sport car.

05:33.597 --> 05:35.782
You have to drive her like a sport car.

05:35.783 --> 05:38.802
If you drive her like a school teacher,
she'll clog up.

05:39.233 --> 05:42.567
Try changing up at 5000 RPM, not two.

05:42.681 --> 05:48.259
Drive like you mean it.
Hard, tight, she'll run clean.

05:48.643 --> 05:52.349
Are you telling me
I don't know how to drive my own car?

05:53.338 --> 05:54.498
No.

05:54.825 --> 06:00.518
But if you ask me, this isn't your car.
Your car is more Plymouth, Studebaker.

06:02.054 --> 06:04.255
You and me have a problem, buddy?

06:04.951 --> 06:07.660
I don't have a problem.
I run MG. Mine's just fine.

06:07.661 --> 06:10.975
Screw you you limey prick!
I want my money back!

06:10.976 --> 06:13.281
Behave. I'd give it to ya.

06:13.282 --> 06:15.458
But you haven't paid
for last months service yet.

06:15.459 --> 06:18.213
This country,
the customer is always right.

06:18.214 --> 06:20.357
- You ever hear of that?
- Yeah.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.056
Utter nonsense.

06:23.057 --> 06:28.039
And remember, I advanced the timing,
so, smidge twitchy in first!

06:28.508 --> 06:32.322
Give her revs up. Good lad. Return.

06:33.139 --> 06:34.957
Ciao.

06:37.126 --> 06:39.544
Another satisfied customer?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.688
Can I help you, Miss?

06:45.515 --> 06:47.978
Wasn't that an MGA 1500?

06:49.598 --> 06:51.847
You know your cars.

06:52.121 --> 06:53.650
I like them.

06:53.651 --> 06:57.876
I love the sound they make.
The way it goes right through you.

06:59.708 --> 07:01.774
That vibration.

07:03.212 --> 07:08.758
Mine's the
wood paneled Country Squire.

07:09.268 --> 07:11.101
Across the street.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.076
The real huprod.

07:14.077 --> 07:15.377
Oh, yeah?

07:15.558 --> 07:17.140
- Is it fast?
- Very.

07:17.340 --> 07:20.615
Wait a second.
What type of girl are you?

07:20.828 --> 07:23.525
Type of girl who likes the smell
of wet gasoline.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.047
Burnt rubber.

07:25.048 --> 07:28.012
Are you some kind of a deviant?

07:28.370 --> 07:30.616
Only since I married you.

07:38.451 --> 07:40.229
Hey, Garry.
What's going on?

07:55.627 --> 07:57.753
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

08:07.590 --> 08:09.879
Shut it down, Mr. Beebe.

08:16.059 --> 08:17.449
John!

08:34.207 --> 08:35.961
Hear that?

08:38.328 --> 08:42.770
That's the sound
of the Ford Motor Company

08:42.918 --> 08:45.156
out of business.

08:50.330 --> 08:56.010
In 1899 my grandfather
Henry my God Ford

08:56.238 --> 09:01.584
was walking home from Edison Illumination
after working a double shift.

09:01.826 --> 09:03.907
He was ruminating.

09:03.993 --> 09:09.285
That morning he had himself an idea
that changed the world.

09:09.490 --> 09:14.678
65 years and 47 million
automobiles later,

09:14.679 --> 09:17.721
what shall be his legacy?

09:19.091 --> 09:23.580
Gettin' it in the tailpipe
from a Chevy Impala.

09:27.360 --> 09:31.601
Here's what I want you to do.
Walk home.

09:34.401 --> 09:38.527
While you're walking
I want you to ruminate.

09:38.551 --> 09:45.162
Man comes to my office with an idea.
That man keeps his job.

09:45.328 --> 09:50.451
Rest of you second best
losers stay home.

09:50.621 --> 09:53.228
You don't belong in Ford.

10:02.358 --> 10:04.118
Shelby.

10:06.842 --> 10:09.707
I see you. Open up, buddy.

10:12.156 --> 10:13.612
- Hey.
- Go away.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.231
Come on. You can do it.

10:17.174 --> 10:18.470
Come on, baby.

10:18.471 --> 10:22.299
8:30 AM, time to row.
Let's go!

10:23.024 --> 10:24.803
- Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go!
- Go away!

10:24.804 --> 10:27.664
It's 8:30 AM, baby. Time to row.

10:28.512 --> 10:29.991
Come on.

10:30.925 --> 10:32.983
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Bob.

10:33.210 --> 10:34.646
Is Shelby here?

10:34.655 --> 10:36.655
It's touch and go.

10:42.020 --> 10:44.457
Shelby. You're up bright and early.

10:45.592 --> 10:48.213
Early bird gets the worm, Pops.

10:52.073 --> 10:53.734
All right, who are you worried about?

10:53.780 --> 10:57.924
You got Red Faris and Bill Rushton.
They're all in 327's.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.638
Corvettes. What about Bondurant?

10:59.639 --> 11:01.321
Bondurant, he's still driving...

11:01.322 --> 11:03.764
Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph?

11:04.265 --> 11:06.050
number 614.

11:07.020 --> 11:08.407
All right, just relax, all right?

11:08.408 --> 11:10.282
We gonna eat
those 'vettes for breakfast.

11:10.283 --> 11:13.671
We're lighter, we're faster.
That don't work - we're nastier.

11:18.527 --> 11:21.441
Hey, Bill.
Take it easy on us today, bud.

11:25.726 --> 11:26.761
All right.

11:26.762 --> 11:29.877
Paragraph 15.4 Section 2B
of the SCCA standard

11:29.878 --> 11:36.296
dictates all AF class cars must have
minimum trunk space 20″ by 12″ by 6″.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.165
Your trunk doesn't close,

11:38.166 --> 11:40.371
- ergo car fails standard.
- Wait, wait. What?

11:40.372 --> 11:42.908
Ergo car is disqualified from
said Class A.

11:42.909 --> 11:44.133
No, no, no.

11:44.134 --> 11:45.571
- Can I ask you a question?
- All right.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.830
When you were a little boy.

11:47.349 --> 11:49.941
Did you think, when I grow up

11:49.942 --> 11:52.712
I wanna go to the fabled
Willow Springs Raceway

11:52.713 --> 11:55.472
and I wanna enforce
Paragraph 15.4 Section 2B

11:55.473 --> 11:58.122
of the SCCA regulations
on luggage capacity.

11:58.123 --> 11:59.734
All right, that's it.

12:00.040 --> 12:03.345
I'm ruling you and your team
disqualified from this race.

12:05.177 --> 12:07.122
If it isn't Lance Reventlow.

12:07.319 --> 12:08.250
Shelby.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.075
How you're doing Lance?

12:09.075 --> 12:10.048
- Pops.
- Hey Lance.

12:10.049 --> 12:11.504
Allow me to introduce
Dieter Voss.

12:11.505 --> 12:13.006
Runs Brumos Porsche
out of Jacksonville Florida.

12:13.007 --> 12:14.591
I know all about Mr. Voss,

12:14.592 --> 12:16.752
you're having a hell of a
season with that Abarth, sir.

12:17.259 --> 12:19.631
- Seeing results for your Cobra too.
- Thank you.

12:19.632 --> 12:22.623
- Your guy Miles is impressive.
- You're following Miles?

12:23.019 --> 12:27.207
He was a USAC road racing champ in '61.
He won the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.

12:27.208 --> 12:29.824
He was SCCA C-class champion,
3 years in a row

12:29.825 --> 12:32.221
in this piece of shit
MG he built himself.

12:32.222 --> 12:33.956
We heard he's difficult.

12:33.957 --> 12:34.943
What, Ken?

12:34.944 --> 12:36.394
No, no. Ken is a puppy dog.

12:36.395 --> 12:38.764
Lance, tell the man.
You raced against Ken.

12:38.765 --> 12:41.087
I've driven more behind him
than against him.

12:41.447 --> 12:46.067
Brumos is looking for a driver
for our number two car at Sebring.

12:46.068 --> 12:47.292
Is that right?

12:47.293 --> 12:49.480
You think your guy Miles
could make the grade?

12:49.481 --> 12:50.959
Oh, well...

12:51.707 --> 12:55.552
Jim, is it impotently
bloody carry on on your trunk?

12:56.472 --> 12:58.271
Gentlemen, excuse me a moment.

12:59.149 --> 13:01.899
To be honest, Ken was born for Sebring.

13:02.655 --> 13:08.163
Nothing in there about my trunk
and your lovely little portmanteau.

13:08.164 --> 13:11.226
You're holding a '62 edition of the SCCA.

13:12.676 --> 13:16.742
You can stick this bloody sticker
where the sun never shines.

13:16.743 --> 13:19.145
Hey. Hey, Bill.
What seems to be the problem?

13:19.146 --> 13:21.146
The problem is
that Bill here is an arsehole.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.762
- No, he doesn't mean that.
- Yes, he does.

13:23.763 --> 13:27.574
He really does think
that Bill is an arsehole.

13:27.575 --> 13:29.044
I'm just doing my job here.

13:29.182 --> 13:31.916
Bill, in my experience, there is...
Listen to me.

13:31.993 --> 13:34.117
Something like this, there's always
the middle ground, all right?

13:34.141 --> 13:35.917
- Ken's out of line, all right?
- And I'm just doing my job.

13:35.918 --> 13:36.789
I understand you are.

13:36.790 --> 13:39.153
You know how it gets on a race day.
You know that, all right?

13:39.154 --> 13:41.259
But you're not gonna DQ us
over the trunk.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.491
Happy, Bill?

14:04.175 --> 14:06.932
I'll talk to him.
You just go and have a great day.

14:10.651 --> 14:12.137
Shit.

14:12.138 --> 14:13.616
Bulldog.

14:15.194 --> 14:16.946
Do you know who that was
I was just talking to?

14:16.947 --> 14:18.573
- Bill.
- Before that.

14:18.574 --> 14:19.629
No.

14:19.764 --> 14:22.399
- It was Dieter Voss.
- Who's that?

14:23.494 --> 14:25.289
He runs Porsche, Ken.

14:25.434 --> 14:27.888
It's a little German car company,
maybe you heard of it.

14:28.589 --> 14:31.759
He wanted you to drive at Sebring,
but he heard you were difficult.

14:37.189 --> 14:39.807
I thought we felt
the same way about

14:40.635 --> 14:42.460
Germans.

14:46.847 --> 14:49.141
Do you like losing, Ken?

14:50.793 --> 14:53.206
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

14:53.962 --> 14:55.502
I don't lose.

14:55.935 --> 14:59.130
Without sponsors, you get no car, Ken.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.839
Last I checked,
the professionals all have a car.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.855
You cannot win the SCCA without one.
If you are not winning you are losing.

15:06.856 --> 15:09.351
Don't make me lump this
at your head.

15:09.352 --> 15:12.164
Did you bring your son all the way out here
to watch you get disqualified,

15:12.165 --> 15:14.165
or just act like a jackass?

15:22.379 --> 15:24.425
That answers that.

15:42.261 --> 15:43.668
Peter.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.673
May I help you, gentlemen?

15:54.957 --> 15:56.914
Yes, is Ken Miles here?

15:57.053 --> 15:58.071
No.

15:58.072 --> 16:00.566
- We need to speak to Mr. Miles.
- I'm his wife.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.640
<i>Welcome to the 1963 World's Greatest.</i>

16:03.641 --> 16:07.290
<i>112 cars will be competing
at this 40 lap race.</i>

16:08.371 --> 16:11.535
Hey, Ken.
What happened to your shield?

16:12.303 --> 16:14.469
New design.

16:15.260 --> 16:17.142
<i>It looks like we are about to begin.</i>

16:17.143 --> 16:21.410
<i>The cars are completing the roll out lap.
The green flag is out.</i>

16:22.047 --> 16:24.535
<i>And they're approaching the starting lap.</i>

16:24.536 --> 16:26.254
Here we go.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.436
Bloody hell!

16:35.443 --> 16:37.806
Learn to drive, you pillock!

16:43.408 --> 16:45.528
So, Shelby, you miss it?

16:47.428 --> 16:48.939
Hey, Sam.

16:49.681 --> 16:54.714
Guy wins the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Suddenly retires. Starts selling cars.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.633
It just doesn't make sense.

16:57.634 --> 17:00.429
Well, unless the rumors are true,
of course.

17:00.430 --> 17:02.805
What rumors would those be, Sam?

17:03.541 --> 17:06.367
That Carroll Shelby quit driving
'cause he lost his nerve.

17:11.646 --> 17:14.675
I'll give it up and I'll break you
on the next turn, Bob.

17:26.823 --> 17:28.464
Nice try, Bob

17:46.326 --> 17:48.949
<i>Nice move from Ken Miles.
22 laps remaining.</i>

18:13.869 --> 18:16.697
<i>It's been an incredible day
here in Willow Springs.</i>

18:16.709 --> 18:18.857
<i>We've seen some exciting riding.</i>

18:19.042 --> 18:22.342
<i>With only 1 lap remaining
in this 40 lap race.</i>

18:22.343 --> 18:24.376
<i>We are coming to the final scratch.</i>

18:24.377 --> 18:28.341
<i>Dan Gurney has been leading
the pack for the most of the...</i>

18:30.126 --> 18:31.952
<i>Red Faris is off the track.</i>

18:31.953 --> 18:36.339
<i>That leaves Dan Gurney for the lead,
followed by journeyman Ken Miles.</i>

18:38.626 --> 18:40.268
Now for you, Dan.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.477
<i>And they're coming
around the last turn.</i>

18:47.478 --> 18:51.132
<i>Gurney is still in the lead
with Ken Miles out of dispute.</i>

18:58.332 --> 18:59.801
<i>Miles is looking for an opening.</i>

18:59.802 --> 19:01.020
Not yet.

19:01.543 --> 19:03.029
Come on!

19:03.869 --> 19:05.912
<i>Can Gurney hold him off?
The final streak.</i>

19:05.913 --> 19:07.217
Not yet.

19:09.562 --> 19:11.295
<i>Gurney is blocking him out.</i>

19:11.315 --> 19:12.613
Now.

19:17.694 --> 19:19.360
Nice move, Ken.

19:23.577 --> 19:24.698
<i>They're wheel to wheel.</i>

19:24.699 --> 19:26.303
Come on!

19:35.856 --> 19:40.250
<i>An incredible finish for Ken Miles.
Didn't see that one coming.</i>

19:42.683 --> 19:45.085
He's difficult, but good.

19:46.999 --> 19:49.710
That goes for a nice coup of tea.

19:49.958 --> 19:51.962
I've got the kettle on.

19:51.999 --> 19:53.585
Hop in.

20:09.299 --> 20:11.556
Pops, frame this.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.586
Hey.

20:25.710 --> 20:27.528
We did it!

20:29.471 --> 20:31.256
What's wrong?

20:32.777 --> 20:36.587
The IRS came.
They've padlocked the garage.

20:41.888 --> 20:43.863
All right, Petey.

20:56.357 --> 20:58.278
Couple of years ago

20:59.123 --> 21:01.003
you said we'd a nest-egg.

21:01.059 --> 21:02.460
Correct.

21:03.882 --> 21:06.352
- A couple of years ago.
- Correct.

21:11.532 --> 21:13.986
So, just to be clear,
we are buggered.

21:14.247 --> 21:15.879
Absolutely.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.390
As in totally?

21:24.738 --> 21:29.697
As in not a bean
or a pot in which to piss.

21:29.950 --> 21:35.207
Spares. Stock. All gone.
Tools. My tools are locked up in there.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.658
I'll figure something out.

21:40.131 --> 21:44.043
In 1945 our soldiers came home.

21:44.559 --> 21:47.132
What was the first thing
that they did?

21:48.513 --> 21:50.360
They had sex.

21:51.594 --> 21:54.985
17 years later, those babies,
they've grown.

21:54.986 --> 21:58.377
They've got jobs. They've got licenses.

21:58.498 --> 22:00.154
But they do not wanna drive

22:00.155 --> 22:03.740
the same dull 50's cars
their parents drove.

22:04.441 --> 22:09.490
You see, kids today, they want glamor.
They wanna sex appeal.

22:09.498 --> 22:11.139
They wanna go fast.

22:11.618 --> 22:12.805
Gentlemen.

22:13.084 --> 22:16.982
It's time for the Ford Motor Company
to go racing.

22:18.073 --> 22:20.559
We're already in racing, Iacocca.

22:20.962 --> 22:24.293
NASCAR? It's regional, sir.

22:25.091 --> 22:26.725
If you go to the movies.

22:26.758 --> 22:30.576
You open up a magazine, you don't see
good ol' boys in Winston-Salem.

22:30.577 --> 22:31.916
You see

22:32.843 --> 22:34.809
Sophia Loren,

22:35.469 --> 22:37.500
Monica Vitti.

22:39.886 --> 22:43.204
James Bond does not drive a Ford, sir.

22:43.428 --> 22:46.217
That's because he's a degenerate.

22:49.803 --> 22:50.806
See?

22:50.807 --> 22:53.092
God, I'd like to be a degenerate.

22:53.826 --> 22:54.963
Just give me one second, please.

22:54.964 --> 22:56.661
Is this part of it?

22:56.764 --> 22:59.673
- Is this going anywhere, Iacocca?
- Sorry, sir.

22:59.828 --> 23:02.050
- All right. All right. That's enough.
- Sir, if you just bear waiting...

23:02.051 --> 23:04.014
Turn it off! Lights!

23:07.822 --> 23:13.320
Lee, in the last 3 years
you and your marketing team

23:13.517 --> 23:18.432
have presided over
the worst sale slump in US history.

23:20.175 --> 23:23.589
Why exactly should Mr. Ford listen to you?

23:26.054 --> 23:28.421
Because we've been thinking wrong.

23:31.324 --> 23:32.784
Ferrari.

23:33.529 --> 23:36.677
They won 4 out of the last 5 Le Mans.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.673
We need to think like Ferrari.

23:40.137 --> 23:44.512
Ferrari makes fewer cars in a year
than we make in a day.

23:45.235 --> 23:50.313
We spend more on toilet paper
than they do on their entire output.

23:50.494 --> 23:52.762
You want us to think like them?

23:52.763 --> 23:54.927
Enzo Ferrari will go down in history

23:54.928 --> 23:57.294
as the greatest car
manufacturer of all time.

23:58.689 --> 23:59.939
Why?

24:00.631 --> 24:04.418
Is it because he built the most cars?

24:05.798 --> 24:06.798
No.

24:07.494 --> 24:10.249
It's because of what his cars mean.

24:11.049 --> 24:12.372
Victory.

24:12.510 --> 24:15.192
Ferrari wins at Le Mans.
People they...

24:15.604 --> 24:18.063
They want some of that victory.

24:19.941 --> 24:23.356
What if the Ford badge meant victory?

24:23.798 --> 24:27.331
And meant it where it counts with the
first group of 17-year-olds in history.

24:27.332 --> 24:30.501
- with money in their pockets.
- This would take years.

24:30.627 --> 24:36.382
Decades to test and develop a race team
capable of taking on Ferrari.

24:36.608 --> 24:38.268
Ferrari's bankrupt.

24:41.095 --> 24:45.124
Enzo spent every lire he's got chasing
perfection, and you know something?

24:45.125 --> 24:46.794
He got there.

24:47.068 --> 24:48.786
But now he's broke.

25:13.205 --> 25:15.717
You don't have to give up racing
to get a bloody day job, Ken.

25:15.769 --> 25:16.956
I think I do.

25:16.957 --> 25:21.215
I've had my fun, it's time
to put food on the table and grow up.

25:21.331 --> 25:23.817
The garage didn't pay the pills.
Now it's locked up.

25:23.903 --> 25:26.593
Racing doesn't pay them either
and I keep winning.

25:26.594 --> 25:28.314
Yeah, because you're good.

25:28.315 --> 25:30.866
I can't play the game.

25:31.054 --> 25:33.428
I'm not what they call "the people person".

25:33.429 --> 25:34.415
You don't say.

25:34.416 --> 25:37.049
And I'm 45 years old.
Do you really think I'm gonna change?

25:37.050 --> 25:41.132
I'm never gonna get the good rides.
I started too late.

25:41.133 --> 25:43.354
Because you fought in a bloody war!

25:44.727 --> 25:48.368
If you stop
you'd be bloody insufferable.

25:49.361 --> 25:52.484
It was a quick all around the region.
It's over.

25:53.015 --> 25:54.706
Let's look on the bright side.

25:54.818 --> 25:58.901
Now I can get fat and old,
trim the roses and eat pork pies.

26:20.373 --> 26:24.036
Scuzi, please.
No photos, prego.

26:24.128 --> 26:25.239
Relax.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.411
You gotta understand.

26:26.442 --> 26:29.320
This is like the Mafia showing up
to buy the Statue of Liberty.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.704
Kind of the opposite, actually.

26:30.921 --> 26:34.047
if the Press gets wind of this,
the shit will hit the Fangio.

26:34.517 --> 26:38.354
- Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.
- Franco Gozzi, Ferrari.

26:38.968 --> 26:41.713
Sonno queste...
Your journalist?

26:41.714 --> 26:46.834
No, no, Mr. Iacocca.
It's our cameras, just for history.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.724
Four liters Colombo engine.

26:53.342 --> 26:57.313
One man assembles
the entire engine by himself.

26:58.991 --> 27:01.806
Another man assembles the transmission.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.831
Everything hand-built.

27:06.302 --> 27:08.045
Benissimo.

27:20.691 --> 27:22.424
Racing department.

27:23.850 --> 27:26.461
Lee, that's him.

27:31.425 --> 27:35.284
This merger between our companies
will form two entities.

27:38.440 --> 27:43.048
Ford-Ferarri: 90% owned by Ford
who controls all production.

27:47.929 --> 27:53.453
Secondly, Ferarri-Ford, the race team.
90% owned by Ferrari.

27:58.373 --> 28:02.776
In order to secure this
Ford will pay the sum...

28:06.643 --> 28:09.690
10 million dollars.

28:30.350 --> 28:32.196
Excuse me.

28:36.419 --> 28:39.033
He will need some time to read this.

28:39.205 --> 28:40.716
Please.

28:43.604 --> 28:45.179
Understood.

29:37.782 --> 29:39.696
Well done, thank you.

29:56.017 --> 29:59.354
Only one small question.
It concerns my race program.

30:08.469 --> 30:13.470
If I wish to race Le Mans
and you do not wish for me to race Le Mans,

30:13.471 --> 30:15.764
Do we or do we not go?

30:23.552 --> 30:27.137
In that highly unlikely scenario.

30:28.851 --> 30:33.529
If we just can't agree then, yes.
I mean, no.

30:34.549 --> 30:36.140
You are correct.

30:36.805 --> 30:38.781
You do not go.

30:55.891 --> 30:58.822
My integrity as a constructor,
as a man, as an Italian

30:58.823 --> 31:01.307
is deeply insulted by your proposal.

31:02.202 --> 31:04.116
Go back to Michigan.

31:08.579 --> 31:10.684
Back to your big ugly factory.

31:12.900 --> 31:15.954
Back to your big ugly factory
making its ugly little cars.

31:23.210 --> 31:25.855
Tell your pig-headed boss that all his

31:26.620 --> 31:30.816
smug executives are
worthless sons of whores.

31:32.736 --> 31:36.004
Tell him he's not Henry Ford.

31:37.631 --> 31:40.525
He is Henry Ford II.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.311
He played us.

32:09.552 --> 32:12.641
Old man Enzo had no intention
of selling to us.

32:13.017 --> 32:16.116
He used us to up his price.

32:16.466 --> 32:19.426
Embarrass our company,
insult your leadership.

32:19.657 --> 32:22.313
It was a bad idea from the start.

32:30.368 --> 32:33.179
What exactly did he say?

32:40.492 --> 32:46.242
He said Ford makes ugly little cars,
and we make 'em in ugly factory.

32:47.984 --> 32:51.458
He said our executives are sons of whores.

32:54.898 --> 32:56.826
About me.

32:58.325 --> 33:00.506
He called you fatster.

33:02.703 --> 33:04.243
Pig-headed.

33:05.169 --> 33:06.850
Go on.

33:07.779 --> 33:10.369
He said you're not Henry Ford.

33:10.686 --> 33:13.509
You're Henry Ford II.

33:34.897 --> 33:38.496
I want the best engineers.

33:40.281 --> 33:42.069
The best drivers.

33:44.129 --> 33:46.367
I don't care what it costs.

33:49.121 --> 33:51.605
We're gonna build a race car.

33:57.615 --> 34:00.290
And we gonna bury
that goddamn greasy wop

34:00.291 --> 34:04.750
a 100 feet deep
under the finish line at Le Mans.

34:05.414 --> 34:08.447
And I will be there to watch it.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.123
Here they come.
Go! Go! Go!

34:15.349 --> 34:17.103
- Asshole!
- You're really pathetic!

34:17.103 --> 34:18.300
I'm so sorry, girls.

34:18.301 --> 34:20.917
Charlie, quit throwing
crackers at the girls

34:20.918 --> 34:22.918
all damn day, goddammit.

34:23.286 --> 34:26.121
- Do I gotta deal with this?
- It's already taken care of.

34:27.089 --> 34:28.295
Sorry about that.

34:28.297 --> 34:31.303
So, yeah. 289 cubic inch V8.

34:31.434 --> 34:32.204
All right.

34:32.205 --> 34:34.449
Extensive rework of AC Ace's front end

34:34.473 --> 34:36.581
and a stronger rear diff
to handle the torque.

34:36.581 --> 34:38.495
How does she handle the quarter mile?

34:39.134 --> 34:41.378
I'm not saying
you should go drag racing.

34:41.462 --> 34:43.612
But quarter mile is 13.6.

34:43.965 --> 34:45.650
- Is that good?
- That's real good.

34:45.742 --> 34:48.413
He sold that same car
3 times this week.

34:48.570 --> 34:50.733
- You take cash? Is cash okay?
- Cash is okay.

34:50.734 --> 34:53.989
Yeah, mister, you just bought yourself
one hell of a sport car.

34:56.061 --> 34:58.124
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna... Phil.

34:58.325 --> 35:01.061
I'm gonna pass you off to my colleague
here, he gonna take care of you.

35:01.062 --> 35:02.865
Phil, Wyatt.

35:02.866 --> 35:04.885
I'll steal him for one second.

35:05.559 --> 35:06.752
You take the payment.

35:06.753 --> 35:09.989
Whatever you do, do not let him take
that car, that's Jeff Blitzer's car.

35:09.990 --> 35:11.998
And Frank Collins's.
And Steve McQueen's.

35:11.999 --> 35:14.375
Shit, I forgot about McQueen.

35:17.482 --> 35:20.414
Morning, can I help?

35:21.516 --> 35:23.244
Carroll Shelby.

35:23.924 --> 35:25.283
Maybe.

35:26.296 --> 35:28.130
Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.722
What's with the wrench?

35:33.932 --> 35:36.229
That? Long story.

35:36.914 --> 35:39.965
We are just goin'
from strength to strength here, Lee.

35:40.265 --> 35:43.187
Terrific sales.
We're killing it on the track.

35:43.690 --> 35:45.668
Now I know we owe Ford
for the last batch of engines...

35:45.669 --> 35:48.772
Mr. Shelby, I can assure you
I'm not here for the money

35:48.773 --> 35:50.358
that you might owe
Ford for spare parts.

35:51.777 --> 35:53.239
You're not?

35:53.876 --> 35:55.595
No, I'm not.

35:56.377 --> 35:57.421
Okay.

35:57.588 --> 36:00.416
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Ford,
Henry Ford II.

36:00.417 --> 36:03.546
Suppose, hypothetically,

36:03.987 --> 36:07.712
he wanted his company
to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

36:08.783 --> 36:11.386
You're one of the only Americans
that's ever done it.

36:11.934 --> 36:15.187
I'm wondering, what's it take?

36:18.537 --> 36:20.083
Hypothetically?

36:20.854 --> 36:22.533
Hypothetically.

36:23.642 --> 36:25.877
It take something money can't buy.

36:26.622 --> 36:28.590
Money can buy speed.

36:29.659 --> 36:31.696
It isn't about speed, Lee.

36:32.430 --> 36:35.593
It's not just like those other
tracks where all you do is

36:35.594 --> 36:37.672
turn to the left for 4 hours.

36:39.978 --> 36:41.492
To win that race, you need a car

36:41.493 --> 36:43.644
that's light enough to do
200 on the straight areas,

36:43.645 --> 36:47.396
but strong enough to keep that up
for 3000 miles without a break.

36:49.168 --> 36:51.455
Not just the best car y’all ever made,

36:51.456 --> 36:54.890
but better than anything that Enzo Ferrari
shows up with that year.

36:55.019 --> 36:58.772
And that just gets you to the green flag,
that's where your problems really start.

37:00.546 --> 37:04.029
- Is everything okay?
- Go away.

37:11.324 --> 37:13.371
So, you're saying it's challenging.

37:15.913 --> 37:18.121
Look, it's not even a track, Lee.

37:18.619 --> 37:21.469
Le Mans's 8.5 miles of country road

37:22.292 --> 37:25.324
that's narrow, ungraded. It's rough.

37:25.622 --> 37:28.652
There's no camber on the turns. No rails.

37:31.325 --> 37:33.793
You gotta do that for 24 hours.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.734
24 hours, Lee.

37:38.379 --> 37:40.079
That means night.

37:40.308 --> 37:43.363
Half of that race is in the dark,
you can't see shit.

37:44.847 --> 37:47.053
Cars coming up on you out of nowhere.

37:48.344 --> 37:51.874
Drivers stumblin' around the track
pourin' blood.

37:52.182 --> 37:56.438
Maybe one of them is your friend.
Maybe he's on fire.

37:58.244 --> 38:00.495
You're exhausted. You're hungry.

38:00.683 --> 38:03.557
Can't remember your name.
What country you're in.

38:04.447 --> 38:08.024
And all of a sudden you realize
you're doing 198 on the straight.

38:11.571 --> 38:13.460
And if anything goes wrong.

38:14.315 --> 38:17.286
You blow a gasket, 5 cent washer.

38:17.514 --> 38:19.769
That's it. Whole thing's over.

38:20.145 --> 38:22.263
Ferrari wins again.

38:22.595 --> 38:23.927
Just like it won last year.

38:23.928 --> 38:26.204
The year before that,
and the year before that.

38:30.552 --> 38:34.030
Yeah, it's challenging.

38:35.049 --> 38:38.484
You don't think that
Ford Motor Company can build

38:38.485 --> 38:40.476
the greatest race car
the world's ever seen?

38:40.477 --> 38:44.984
You think that we are
incapable of winning event like that?

38:45.258 --> 38:47.926
Even if we had a brilliant partner?

38:50.284 --> 38:53.762
Even if we wrote a blank check?

39:00.386 --> 39:04.143
What I'm saying is
you can't buy a win, Lee,

39:06.486 --> 39:11.166
but maybe you could buy the guy
who gets you a shot.

39:27.370 --> 39:31.564
The new transmission.
Axles, shocks all around.

39:31.750 --> 39:33.397
Ditch the body and the tires

39:33.398 --> 39:35.553
and you have yourself a contender.

39:36.326 --> 39:38.153
Anything on this beauty
that does work?

39:38.314 --> 39:40.879
The mirrors are outstanding.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.694
I saw that walking up.

39:43.399 --> 39:47.800
So, what?
You're just passing or evening stroll?

39:48.078 --> 39:50.643
Actually, bulldog,
I have a proposition for you.

39:50.803 --> 39:55.212
You gonna build a car
to beat old man Ferrari?

39:55.351 --> 39:59.356
with Ford. With a Ford?

39:59.357 --> 40:00.522
Correct.

40:00.789 --> 40:02.684
And how long did you tell them
that you needed?

40:02.685 --> 40:04.725
Two, three hundred years?

40:04.878 --> 40:06.524
90 days.

40:10.039 --> 40:13.295
All right, so, let's just look
at this for a moment.

40:13.963 --> 40:15.498
And for argument's sake,

40:15.522 --> 40:17.964
let's just forget about
the whole 90 day thing.

40:17.965 --> 40:21.954
Let's just pretend you got all the money
in the world and all the time in the world.

40:21.955 --> 40:23.871
I like the sound of that.

40:25.222 --> 40:28.152
You think that Ford
are gonna let you build

40:28.854 --> 40:33.866
the car that you want
the way you want it?

40:33.867 --> 40:36.781
The Ford Motor Company?

40:37.905 --> 40:39.792
Those guys?

40:40.430 --> 40:44.809
Have you ever been to Detroit?
They have floors and floors of lawyers,

40:44.810 --> 40:47.811
and millions of marketing guys,
and they all gonna wanna meet you,

40:47.812 --> 40:50.631
all of them gonna wanna get their photo
taken with the great Carroll Shelby,

40:50.632 --> 40:53.630
and they gonna kiss your arse, and then
they gonna go back to their lovely offices,

40:53.631 --> 40:56.029
and they would work on
new ways to screw you.

40:56.053 --> 40:58.783
Why? Because they can't help it.

40:58.784 --> 41:00.668
Because they just wanna
please their boss,

41:00.669 --> 41:04.363
who wants to please his boss,
who wants to please his boss.

41:04.364 --> 41:08.239
And they hate themselves for
it, but deep down,

41:08.240 --> 41:11.745
who they hate even
more, the guys like you,

41:11.746 --> 41:14.959
because you're not like them,
because you don't think like them,

41:14.960 --> 41:16.960
because you're different.

41:18.205 --> 41:20.522
It's coming straight from the Deuce.

41:22.583 --> 41:24.008
He's serious.

41:24.009 --> 41:26.311
They gonna put real money behind it.

41:28.762 --> 41:30.568
I bet they are.

41:31.123 --> 41:35.367
You know why?
Because someone, and I'm not saying who.

41:35.368 --> 41:41.320
Someone has told them
that this is actually possible.

41:41.761 --> 41:45.427
Look, this Sunday at Cloverfield,
they're launching a new Mustang.

41:45.428 --> 41:47.396
I'm gonna announce the race program.

41:48.199 --> 41:50.060
Just come on by.

41:51.958 --> 41:54.659
Come take a look.
Listen to my speech.

41:55.333 --> 41:58.286
I'm making a speech.
Bring Peter, he'll love it.

42:00.215 --> 42:01.950
I'll watch you.

42:04.328 --> 42:05.626
See you Sunday.

42:11.438 --> 42:14.091
Dad, look at that.

42:18.046 --> 42:20.754
Ford Mustang. What do you think?

42:23.982 --> 42:26.161
I think it's a secretary's car.

42:27.599 --> 42:29.357
I like it.

42:31.550 --> 42:33.820
Excuse me. Excuse me.

42:35.282 --> 42:37.302
Would you mind not to do that?

42:38.731 --> 42:40.223
Sorry.

42:43.773 --> 42:47.279
- Is this your son?
- Yes, it is.

42:47.447 --> 42:50.755
Would you ask him
to keep his hands off the paintwork?

42:50.830 --> 42:53.315
No, no, Petey, you're okay.
Who are you?

42:53.969 --> 42:57.176
Leo Beebe, Senior Executive Vice President,
Ford Motor Company.

42:57.177 --> 43:00.173
I am responsible
for the launch of the Mustang.

43:00.433 --> 43:02.857
At least now we know who's responsible.

43:02.858 --> 43:04.694
- Don't get me wrong, Lenny.
- Leo.

43:04.695 --> 43:09.157
It looks fantastic,
but inside it's a lump of lard

43:09.158 --> 43:10.595
dressed up to fool the public.

43:10.596 --> 43:15.582
My advice is: lose the Inline 6
and that idiotic 3 speeds,

43:15.583 --> 43:19.222
shorten wheelbase.
Somehow lose half a ton.

43:19.316 --> 43:21.363
- And lower the price.
- Dad.

43:21.490 --> 43:25.526
But even then
I'd still choose the Chevy Chevelle.

43:25.765 --> 43:28.361
That's a fucking terrible car.

43:29.624 --> 43:31.515
How are we doing up there, Steve?

43:31.731 --> 43:33.889
There's Cloverfield, Mr. Shelby.

43:34.507 --> 43:35.689
Oh, yeah.

43:36.336 --> 43:38.804
You mind if I take a shot
at the landing?

43:39.461 --> 43:42.979
Come on, I mean it. I flew a B-29s
outta San Antonio back in '44.

43:42.980 --> 43:44.601
- Are you kidding me?
- I did.

43:45.086 --> 43:45.959
Okay.

43:45.960 --> 43:47.535
Carroll, what are you doing?

43:47.536 --> 43:48.813
- Does he know how to fly?
- Carroll.

43:48.814 --> 43:51.170
I had an instructor
who'd tell me

43:51.492 --> 43:54.000
Looking down I would say
it's probably a good time to buckle up.

43:54.001 --> 43:56.251
Do everybody a favor
and stay on the ground.

43:56.712 --> 43:58.526
That's a true story.

44:01.555 --> 44:05.141
This is the car
you never expected for Detroit.

44:07.820 --> 44:10.470
All right. Let's go.

44:12.429 --> 44:13.992
Not staying, Ken?

44:14.581 --> 44:16.781
It's a bloody pig in a poke, isn't it.

44:16.800 --> 44:18.325
There they come now.

44:22.847 --> 44:25.167
Wait, are they crashing?

44:25.450 --> 44:26.932
Who is the pilot?

44:27.210 --> 44:29.199
My guess, Peter...

44:32.267 --> 44:33.877
Someone we know.

44:34.706 --> 44:36.800
Everything all right up there?

44:37.022 --> 44:38.074
No!

44:38.751 --> 44:39.882
Hang on.

44:39.883 --> 44:42.233
Shit!

44:45.931 --> 44:48.333
I'll tell you what,
that's like riding a bike.

44:54.552 --> 44:57.678
Talking about making an entrance.
Good grief.

44:58.148 --> 44:59.856
- Shelby!
- Over here!

45:01.662 --> 45:03.187
Hey out there.

45:04.257 --> 45:05.617
Can we have an autograph, sir?

45:05.618 --> 45:06.995
Shelby, this is Roy Lunn.

45:06.996 --> 45:09.742
Ol' Roy here is developing
the prototype over in England.

45:09.895 --> 45:11.799
Hell, I know Roy.
Good to see you, Roy.

45:11.809 --> 45:13.023
Welcome to madhouse, Shelby.

45:13.024 --> 45:15.615
Ford willed up the entire
executive committee for this one.

45:15.974 --> 45:17.712
Hold that thought.

45:18.703 --> 45:20.703
Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.

45:20.864 --> 45:22.836
Did you like that?
Hey, Peter, how are you doing?

45:22.837 --> 45:24.294
- Mr. Shelby.
- Good to see you.

45:24.295 --> 45:26.874
Are you building a car
so you can beat Ferrari?

45:27.423 --> 45:30.425
Well, we're gonna go to Le Mans,
that's for sure.

45:30.426 --> 45:32.514
And if get across that finish line first
we gonna win.

45:32.515 --> 45:36.429
Carroll, allow me to introduce Leo Beebe,
Senior Vice President Ford Motor.

45:36.774 --> 45:37.497
Oh, sure, yeah.

45:37.498 --> 45:38.738
- Please Mr. Beebe.
- Thank you for coming.

45:38.739 --> 45:40.810
Say hello to Ken Miles
and his son Peter.

45:41.380 --> 45:42.621
- We...
- Right.

45:42.622 --> 45:44.013
We met.

45:46.186 --> 45:47.673
Didn't we?

45:49.577 --> 45:52.235
I'll take Petey for some pop.

45:52.527 --> 45:54.332
Good luck with these guys, Shel.

45:54.443 --> 45:56.421
- Bye, Mr. Shelby.
- See you, Pete.

45:56.746 --> 45:58.493
Don't worry, he's gonna stay.

45:59.581 --> 46:01.932
You two had a chance
to talk on the plane?

46:03.163 --> 46:07.450
Yeah, Carroll, why don't we just...
Step this way for a second...

46:14.376 --> 46:16.410
Look, it's pro forma.
It's window dressing.

46:16.411 --> 46:20.141
But there's gotta be a sense
of getting the tape between you and....

46:21.103 --> 46:23.241
- No, I don't.
- The group.

46:23.242 --> 46:24.373
The group?

46:24.573 --> 46:28.472
Senior creatives, Carroll.
Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.

46:28.584 --> 46:29.906
I'm confused, Lee.

46:29.907 --> 46:32.991
'Cause up until this moment
right now I was comfortable.

46:33.744 --> 46:35.676
Why don't you take a look
out there, Carroll?

46:36.021 --> 46:37.394
What do you see?

46:37.821 --> 46:40.482
Do you know what I see?
I see a machine.

46:40.555 --> 46:43.927
I see ten thousand moving parts
moving, hopefully, in harmony.

46:43.928 --> 46:46.959
And it's my job to make it so.
It's my job to guide you through it.

46:46.960 --> 46:50.619
I'm here to help you, Carroll.
But you gotta trust me.

46:51.764 --> 46:53.660
- Excuse me, Lee.
- Carroll.

46:53.731 --> 46:56.105
Do not step on that stage
if you don't trust me.

46:56.189 --> 46:58.686
Please, welcome Mr. Carroll Shelby.

46:58.687 --> 47:00.287
Gotta go.

47:06.943 --> 47:09.333
- What did he say?
- He gets the drill.

47:12.397 --> 47:13.854
Thank you.

47:14.354 --> 47:16.266
If my Daddy was here today

47:16.606 --> 47:21.153
he'd tell me to sit on down
and leave the yackin' to the college boys.

47:21.502 --> 47:24.021
Like my cars, I'll make this fast.

47:26.165 --> 47:28.841
When I was 10 years old,
my Pops said, son

47:29.422 --> 47:33.383
it's a truly lucky man who knows
what he wants to do in this world.

47:33.578 --> 47:36.146
'Cause that man will never work
a day in his life.

47:36.892 --> 47:38.881
But there are a few, a precious few,

47:38.882 --> 47:41.564
and hell I don't know
if they're lucky or not,

47:42.394 --> 47:45.640
but there are a few people
who find something they have to do.

47:46.740 --> 47:48.573
Something obsesses them.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.450
Something if they can't do it,

47:51.451 --> 47:53.451
it's gonna drive them
clean outta their mind.

47:54.463 --> 47:56.151
I'm that guy.

47:56.842 --> 47:59.807
And I know one other man
feels exactly the same.

48:01.095 --> 48:02.611
His name...

48:04.562 --> 48:07.088
His name is Mr. Henry Ford.

48:11.143 --> 48:15.516
And together we gonna build
the fastest automobile in the world.

48:18.338 --> 48:21.920
And we gonna make history too at Le Mans.

48:23.941 --> 48:25.683
Let's go.

48:26.495 --> 48:31.041
My name is Carroll Shelby.
I build race cars.

48:53.861 --> 48:56.271
No, Whatever it is, no.

48:57.882 --> 48:59.218
No.

49:00.005 --> 49:01.542
30 minutes.

49:03.429 --> 49:05.228
I'm spent, I wanna have a bath.

49:05.229 --> 49:08.713
You gonna wanna see this.
Trust me.

49:10.259 --> 49:12.982
30 minutes.
I'll have you back for meatloaf and gravy.

49:15.973 --> 49:18.412
- 30 minutes.
- Yeah.

49:36.854 --> 49:38.769
Bloody hell.

49:44.251 --> 49:46.410
Fresh off the plane from England.

49:48.604 --> 49:52.001
She's still a little
on the rare side of cooked.

50:02.132 --> 50:03.327
Come on.

50:16.123 --> 50:17.512
Interesting.

50:34.194 --> 50:35.314
Well?

50:35.315 --> 50:38.036
- It's awful.
- It's worse than awful.

50:38.037 --> 50:41.345
It doesn't track.
The 3rd gear is too high,

50:42.733 --> 50:45.341
torque is not reaching the road.

50:45.557 --> 50:49.247
Steering's loose because
the front end gets light.

50:49.248 --> 50:51.736
At over 140 it thinks it's...

50:52.110 --> 50:53.633
- Airplane.
- Yeah.

50:54.201 --> 50:56.576
It wants to lift off and fly to Hawaii.

50:59.134 --> 51:01.018
Anything else?

51:05.958 --> 51:07.270
One second.

51:37.691 --> 51:39.560
You were back late last night.

51:39.561 --> 51:41.140
Yeah.

51:44.235 --> 51:45.924
Were you working?

51:50.129 --> 51:52.067
Didn't go anyplace?

51:52.557 --> 51:53.867
What?

51:55.935 --> 51:58.628
I'm asking, did you go
anyplace last night?

52:00.747 --> 52:02.154
Mollie.

52:02.155 --> 52:04.305
It's a simple question.

52:06.330 --> 52:08.001
And I answered, didn't I?

52:08.107 --> 52:09.792
What was the answer?

52:11.617 --> 52:13.425
Is something up, luv?

52:14.838 --> 52:15.889
What are you doing?

52:15.890 --> 52:18.150
What are you doing?
You're driving very fast.

52:18.151 --> 52:19.773
Am I? Am I?

52:19.774 --> 52:21.677
Yes, you are!

52:23.024 --> 52:25.245
Bloody hell!
What are you..? What is this?

52:25.576 --> 52:27.205
You tell me 'cause I don't know.

52:27.206 --> 52:29.516
What? Slow down!

52:30.352 --> 52:31.929
Mollie!

52:34.004 --> 52:37.656
Please! Slow it down! All right?
You're trying to kill us or something?

52:37.828 --> 52:40.490
- I thought we love this shit.
- What?

52:41.671 --> 52:42.569
Bloody hell!

52:42.570 --> 52:45.806
- It's a bit of racing fun, no?
- No, it's not the same!

52:46.224 --> 52:48.173
I think it's thrilling!

52:48.729 --> 52:49.920
All right.

52:50.398 --> 52:52.384
I saw you, all right?

52:53.032 --> 52:55.837
I saw you leaving with Shelby,
and I saw you coming back.

52:55.838 --> 52:57.504
Okay. Shit. Okay.
Slow down.

52:57.505 --> 52:59.579
All then all day you got
that stupid look on your face.

52:59.580 --> 53:02.312
Mollie, slow down!
You're too close in.

53:05.066 --> 53:07.529
Mollie, pull on the brakes right now!

53:07.530 --> 53:09.719
Not until you tell me what's going on!

53:09.720 --> 53:12.189
All right. I went to look at a car.

53:12.190 --> 53:13.949
- With Shelby?
- With Shelby.

53:14.149 --> 53:16.404
- A racing car?
- Sort of.

53:17.596 --> 53:20.068
There's a corner coming,
you better hold on.

53:21.329 --> 53:23.361
Are you gonna lift your foot off
at all through this?

53:23.362 --> 53:25.111
No. 'Cause I like that clean race inline.

53:25.112 --> 53:27.030
Slow down!

53:30.576 --> 53:34.071
Okay. Shel offered me a job.
Ford owns a car

53:34.171 --> 53:36.328
that they wanna put up
against the Ferrari.

53:36.428 --> 53:40.110
- You told me you were done!
- I didn't say yes!

53:40.437 --> 53:42.905
- Slow down!
- You told me you quit!

53:44.025 --> 53:46.364
- I don't understand.
- You fat and old you said!

53:46.502 --> 53:48.533
Fat and old!

53:52.194 --> 53:55.093
- That's what you told me!
- I don't understand.

53:55.453 --> 54:00.371
Are you upset because I said I was done
or because I looked at a race car?

54:01.170 --> 54:03.829
Just don't lie to me again!

54:05.584 --> 54:08.403
Don't make it a secret,
what you want or what you feel

54:08.482 --> 54:11.721
just because you think
it's gonna make me happy!

54:13.344 --> 54:15.936
Mol, I don't even know what I feel.

54:22.621 --> 54:24.635
If you do this

54:27.059 --> 54:29.752
they better be paying you this time.

54:31.335 --> 54:34.493
'Cause I can't work any more hours
and look after Peter.

54:34.494 --> 54:38.291
The IRS has the garage.
I'm not losing my home.

54:38.748 --> 54:40.768
It's 200 a day

54:43.149 --> 54:45.035
plus expenses.

54:47.502 --> 54:49.190
Are you shitting me?

54:49.191 --> 54:51.778
But, I haven't decided.

54:54.244 --> 54:56.547
200 dollars a day?

54:58.663 --> 55:00.512
Are you nuts?

55:23.437 --> 55:25.506
This is ridiculous.

55:27.773 --> 55:30.912
Grabbing air. That's the problem.

55:31.782 --> 55:35.470
Over 90 air's getting in, not getting out.

55:35.471 --> 55:37.557
It's the nose.
I can feel it in the wheel.

55:37.558 --> 55:39.964
Mr. Miles, if there's a problem
the computer will find it.

55:40.338 --> 55:43.734
Charlie, get some scotch tape
and a ball of wool.

55:44.681 --> 55:45.681
All right.

55:45.942 --> 55:50.806
Good, good. Now let's just
get all of this junk out.

55:51.109 --> 55:52.581
All right, Pops?

55:57.272 --> 55:58.608
What are they doing?

55:58.765 --> 56:00.913
Making the car faster.

56:07.991 --> 56:10.717
There! Right there!
Airflow's getting stuck.

56:13.440 --> 56:19.273
I see it. Yarn blows straight up.
Front's lifting. Damn he's right.

56:30.049 --> 56:33.283
This car wants to go faster. I feel it.

56:33.405 --> 56:35.835
Any lighter we're getting fragile.

56:35.836 --> 56:37.836
We took 70 pounds out
of her in the last week.

56:37.919 --> 56:41.040
She's outputting max horsepower
from this displacement.

56:41.606 --> 56:44.923
- So put in a bigger engine.
- Where we gonna put it? On the roof?

56:46.981 --> 56:51.508
Managed to make it 52 pounds lighter
than the NASCAR unit.

56:56.050 --> 56:58.468
All new aluminum cylinder heads.

56:59.263 --> 57:02.552
Vibration dampers. Water pump.
Smaller valves.

57:02.588 --> 57:04.689
We call it "The Beast".

57:04.864 --> 57:09.309
I see why, but how is it gonna fit
without the redesigning the engine pit?

57:09.353 --> 57:11.771
It certainly wasn't easy.
Good Morning, gentlemen, Mr. Shelby.

57:11.772 --> 57:16.381
So, you already put that in a GT-40?

57:17.024 --> 57:18.987
I'm afraid we have.

57:24.457 --> 57:26.136
I'll be damned.

57:26.444 --> 57:27.623
It's heavy, of course.

57:27.624 --> 57:30.413
Problems with the handling especially
the stopping. I can show you the data.

57:30.414 --> 57:31.465
What problems?

57:31.466 --> 57:33.964
Can I borrow that?

57:34.558 --> 57:35.883
Just a second, rhank you.

57:36.043 --> 57:38.074
Ken! Ken!

57:38.682 --> 57:40.751
Perhaps we ought to check with HQ
before you can drive...

57:40.752 --> 57:43.242
- What did you say?
- We should ask...

57:43.698 --> 57:45.120
All right.

57:57.385 --> 57:59.826
Mr. Shelby. Welcome to Dearborn.

57:59.827 --> 58:01.003
What are you doing
at a test track?

58:01.004 --> 58:03.270
You're gonna get Castrol
all over that nice suit.

58:04.012 --> 58:07.744
I want to hear your thoughts on a few
planning decisions. Personnel for Le Mans.

58:07.964 --> 58:10.787
It's a hell of a line up.
Ken Miles. Phil Hill.

58:11.192 --> 58:12.913
Chris Amon. Bruce McLaren.

58:12.914 --> 58:15.389
Hill's a lock. Amon. McLaren too.

58:15.442 --> 58:17.210
We're less sure about Miles.

58:17.211 --> 58:21.827
We like Richie Ginter.
Masten Gregory. Bob Bondurant?

58:22.338 --> 58:27.315
You want the best driver for the car,
who understands the machine, that's Ken.

58:28.753 --> 58:30.026
Yes.

58:30.435 --> 58:33.764
More of that, please.
More of that, my girl.

58:33.765 --> 58:37.628
I may not get the finer points of racing
Mr. Shelby, but I do know people.

58:37.991 --> 58:42.260
Miles is... He's a beatnik.
He dresses like one.

58:43.071 --> 58:46.798
Ford means reliability.
Ken Miles is not a Ford man.

58:48.539 --> 58:50.675
Get it up! Get it up!

58:53.916 --> 58:56.011
What's the lap record here, Burt?

58:56.012 --> 58:57.392
1.58.

58:58.332 --> 58:59.757
1.50. Dead.

58:59.758 --> 59:03.280
A beatnik? That man landed
a busted tank on the beach at D-Day

59:03.281 --> 59:05.554
and drove it clean
across Europe to Berlin.

59:06.326 --> 59:07.655
A beatnik?

59:08.146 --> 59:11.214
Lee here asked me a while back,
what's the one thing money can't buy.

59:12.313 --> 59:13.518
I'll tell you what it is.

59:13.818 --> 59:16.218
A pure racer behind the wheel of your car.

59:16.802 --> 59:18.527
That's Ken Miles.

59:20.245 --> 59:22.277
Be that as it may,

59:22.538 --> 59:25.002
we think he may be too pure.

59:32.419 --> 59:35.751
Carrol, do not lose sight
of the big picture here.

59:36.873 --> 59:38.187
Too pure?

59:39.104 --> 59:40.787
What exactly does that mean?

59:41.574 --> 59:43.663
Means he's all about himself.

59:44.857 --> 59:49.036
ABC puts a microphone under his nose.
Perhaps there's a detail he dislikes.

59:49.184 --> 59:50.427
Millions watching.

59:50.558 --> 59:53.008
Do you trust him not to put out
the wrong message?

59:53.009 --> 59:55.483
He can get it.
Clean cut all American poster boy.

59:55.484 --> 59:57.862
And stick him behind the wheel.
Teach him what to say.

59:58.010 --> 01:00:01.256
Shit, you get Doris Day to drive the car
if all you wanna do is lose.

01:00:01.576 --> 01:00:04.577
So, you don't agree with us
on this issue?

01:00:06.913 --> 01:00:09.240
I'm saying you're gotta trust me
on this one.

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:12.705
Carroll, with marketing concerns,
that's just not possible.

01:00:14.339 --> 01:00:18.041
Put a Ford type driver
in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.

01:00:18.267 --> 01:00:20.366
That's the Ford way.

01:00:26.419 --> 01:00:29.142
<i>Yet another championship win for Ferrari...</i>

01:00:32.034 --> 01:00:33.576
Ferrari wins.

01:00:36.893 --> 01:00:38.571
Wedges. We have wedges.

01:00:39.032 --> 01:00:40.155
Good. Good.

01:00:40.716 --> 01:00:42.040
Perfect.

01:00:42.982 --> 01:00:44.597
- 40?
- Yup.

01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:55.325
Hey, boss.

01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:58.307
You got a passport?

01:00:58.308 --> 01:01:00.336
- What's that?
- Sign that. Get a passport.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.663
Get it back to me by Friday.

01:01:02.965 --> 01:01:04.848
Boys, I'm going to France.

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:07.438
Phil.

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:09.730
Ken, can I get a word?

01:01:18.224 --> 01:01:19.564
Can I take this?

01:01:21.286 --> 01:01:26.392
Do you know why Ford named it the GT-40?
Why they put the 40 on there?

01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:28.281
- No.
- Regulations.

01:01:28.365 --> 01:01:33.973
We gotta be 40″ high
to make the ground clearance requirements.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.685
No more, no less.
They measure it before every race.

01:01:36.686 --> 01:01:42.190
Problem is, that with that height
it's too much drag under the car.

01:01:43.357 --> 01:01:46.117
We got a solution. Wedges.
We put wedges in...

01:01:46.118 --> 01:01:47.803
You're not coming next week.

01:01:50.853 --> 01:01:52.992
You're not coming, Ken.

01:01:55.422 --> 01:01:58.269
We're taking McLaren.
Chris Amon. Phil Hill

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.291
and Bob Bondurant.

01:02:01.903 --> 01:02:03.459
This is Ford's call.

01:02:04.536 --> 01:02:06.965
It is their opinion that
you're not a good image,

01:02:06.966 --> 01:02:08.794
so you cannot drive their race car.

01:02:10.688 --> 01:02:13.449
Putting aside the fact that you made
that car whatever the hell it is,

01:02:14.525 --> 01:02:17.540
and you're the best man I got
behind the wheel.

01:02:37.404 --> 01:02:39.494
I'm gonna re-route the oil line.

01:02:39.495 --> 01:02:43.359
If there's spillage it could drip
onto the rear near side disc.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.154
Ken.

01:02:44.155 --> 01:02:49.295
Tell the boys to watch
their pace come sunrise.

01:02:50.409 --> 01:02:53.238
The gearbox will overheat.

01:03:11.207 --> 01:03:13.776
Ken, race is starting soon.
Want it on the radio?

01:03:14.036 --> 01:03:15.713
Not unless you do.

01:03:38.593 --> 01:03:40.444
<i>but it's still the number
2 car driven by Chris Amon.</i>

01:03:40.445 --> 01:03:44.572
<i>In third place is the #1
Ford driven by Bruce McLaren.</i>

01:03:44.573 --> 01:03:46.533
<i>A tremendously bad start for the Ford GT.</i>

01:03:46.534 --> 01:03:50.728
<i>3:43 for lap for car #2 Ford.</i>

01:03:50.729 --> 01:03:53.625
<i>I think it's a little bit quick
for this stage of the game.</i>

01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:56.026
Racing too hot?

01:04:05.065 --> 01:04:06.640
<i>Another Ford has come in to the pit</i>

01:04:06.641 --> 01:04:09.139
<i>to see it pushed into
the pit by the mechanic.</i>

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:13.227
Head gasket.
The Car is not a moon rocket.

01:04:16.271 --> 01:04:18.691
<i>Leading #20 Ferrari of Michael Fahr.</i>

01:04:18.715 --> 01:04:21.659
So, we have Fords running one,
two, three, how about that?

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.264
Too soon. Surely too soon.

01:04:41.383 --> 01:04:44.049
<i>Here's a big story,
the lead Ford driven by</i>

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:47.557
<i>a Rickie Getzer with
gearbox trouble and the new leader...</i>

01:04:47.558 --> 01:04:52.500
Gearbox. I told them to be gentle with it.

01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.787
Who's there?

01:05:10.165 --> 01:05:12.388
What's that you're listening to?

01:05:12.907 --> 01:05:15.033
Some race over in France.

01:05:17.971 --> 01:05:19.486
Exciting?

01:05:19.658 --> 01:05:22.501
Not really paying much attention.

01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:42.145
It's not exactly Champagne.

01:05:44.404 --> 01:05:46.628
Just got bubbles.

01:06:15.365 --> 01:06:17.274
Thanks, Mollie.

01:07:01.889 --> 01:07:03.558
Grace?

01:07:10.748 --> 01:07:11.926
Yes, sir?

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:15.794
I will sent him right in. Thank you.

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:21.286
Mr. Shelby, Mr. Ford will see you now.

01:07:21.594 --> 01:07:23.191
All right.

01:07:27.379 --> 01:07:29.335
This way, Mr. Shelby.

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:41.690
Mr. Ford, gentlemen.

01:07:41.966 --> 01:07:43.526
Shelby.

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:59.036
Give me one reason why
I don't fire everyone

01:07:59.037 --> 01:08:02.241
associated with this
abomination, starting with you.

01:08:09.098 --> 01:08:10.955
Well, sir.

01:08:11.556 --> 01:08:14.001
I was thinking about that very question

01:08:14.002 --> 01:08:16.267
as I sat out there in
your lovely waiting room.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.683
As I was sitting there I
watched that little red folder

01:08:21.684 --> 01:08:25.406
right there go
through 4 pairs of hands

01:08:26.723 --> 01:08:28.488
before it got to you.

01:08:28.727 --> 01:08:33.153
Of course, I don't include the
22 or so other Ford employees

01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:36.149
who probably poked at it before it
made its way up to the 19th floor.

01:08:38.135 --> 01:08:42.964
With all due respect, sir,
you can’t win a race by committee.

01:08:44.392 --> 01:08:46.493
You need one man in charge.

01:08:46.674 --> 01:08:51.591
Now, the good news is, as I see it,
is that even with the all extra weight

01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:57.871
we still managed to put ol' Mr. Ferrari
exactly where we want him.

01:08:58.183 --> 01:08:59.643
Did we?

01:08:59.825 --> 01:09:01.383
Oh, yes.

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:04.818
Expand.

01:09:05.495 --> 01:09:06.764
Well.

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:10.035
Sure, we haven't...

01:09:10.488 --> 01:09:12.951
We haven't worked out
how to corner yet.

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:18.269
Or stay cool. Or stay on the ground.

01:09:18.466 --> 01:09:20.515
And a lot of stuff broke.

01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:24.158
In fact, the only thing that didn't break
was the brakes.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.997
Yeah, right now, we don't even know

01:09:25.999 --> 01:09:28.566
if our paint job will
last the whole 24 hours.

01:09:35.027 --> 01:09:40.983
But our last lap, we clocked 218 mph
down the Mulsanne straight.

01:09:41.265 --> 01:09:44.640
Now, in all his years of racing

01:09:45.327 --> 01:09:49.252
ol' Enzo ain't never seen
anything move that fast.

01:09:50.048 --> 01:09:53.461
And now he knows without a doubt,

01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:57.115
we're faster than he is.

01:10:00.312 --> 01:10:04.715
Even with the wrong driver.
And all the committees.

01:10:06.261 --> 01:10:08.166
And that's what he's thinking about

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:11.948
while he's sitting in
Modena, Italy right now.

01:10:14.323 --> 01:10:16.517
That man is scared to death

01:10:17.358 --> 01:10:22.030
that this year you actually
might be smart enough to start trusting me.

01:10:24.562 --> 01:10:26.163
So, yeah.

01:10:27.645 --> 01:10:30.915
I'd say you got Ferrari
exactly where you want him.

01:10:34.225 --> 01:10:36.359
You're welcome.

01:10:53.427 --> 01:10:55.250
Come here.

01:11:02.476 --> 01:11:04.906
You see that little building down there?

01:11:04.907 --> 01:11:10.972
In World War II, three out of five
US bombers rolled off that line.

01:11:13.194 --> 01:11:17.933
You think Roosevelt beat Hitler?
Think again.

01:11:18.015 --> 01:11:22.025
This isn't the first time
Ford Motor's gone to war in Europe.

01:11:23.719 --> 01:11:26.531
We know how to do more
than push paper.

01:11:28.606 --> 01:11:32.202
And there is one man
running this company.

01:11:33.613 --> 01:11:35.765
You report to him.

01:11:36.342 --> 01:11:38.172
You understand me?

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:40.076
Yes, sir.

01:11:40.734 --> 01:11:43.864
Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.

01:11:46.434 --> 01:11:48.209
Thank you, sir.

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:23.225
You were right. It's a gearbox.

01:12:23.894 --> 01:12:25.591
We ran too hot.

01:12:26.403 --> 01:12:30.317
Three out of four of 'em broke.
Rod blew on other one.

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:37.283
We're goin' back, Ken.

01:12:40.647 --> 01:12:44.252
They told me I have
a <i>carte blanche</i> this time.

01:12:45.619 --> 01:12:48.389
I looked up,
it's French for "horse shit".

01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:50.327
I know they gonna squeeze
our nuts any way they can

01:12:50.328 --> 01:12:51.662
as soon as they work out how.

01:12:52.559 --> 01:12:56.559
Well, the ice cream's melting.

01:12:59.145 --> 01:13:00.950
All right. Hey, Ken.

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:03.758
You want me to apologize?

01:13:07.309 --> 01:13:09.146
You want me to beg?

01:13:09.147 --> 01:13:12.882
I don't know, let's try it out.
Let's see how that feels.

01:13:18.963 --> 01:13:22.401
Ken, I'm sorry. Sincerely.

01:13:26.906 --> 01:13:31.287
Do you have any idea the kind of shit that I
had to eat just to get 4 wheels on that grid?

01:13:31.288 --> 01:13:33.834
No, you don't, 'cause you don't deal
with any of that stuff.

01:13:34.034 --> 01:13:35.401
Now, knock it off, Ken!

01:13:35.402 --> 01:13:38.457
We got work to do,
and this car ain't gonna build itself.

01:13:46.662 --> 01:13:48.574
Okay. All right.

01:14:01.581 --> 01:14:03.080
Come here!

01:14:03.498 --> 01:14:05.378
Bloody car salesman.

01:14:05.379 --> 01:14:06.890
Shit!

01:14:09.005 --> 01:14:11.146
Come on. Now you're gonna get this.

01:14:15.295 --> 01:14:16.892
Get off me!

01:14:37.453 --> 01:14:38.912
Come here!

01:14:48.177 --> 01:14:49.493
Mollie, darling.

01:14:50.108 --> 01:14:51.544
Yes, luv?

01:14:51.545 --> 01:14:53.664
Could you give me a pop, please?

01:14:54.397 --> 01:14:56.018
Yes, luv.

01:14:57.486 --> 01:14:59.564
- Do you want one too, Shelby?
- No.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.838
- Yes, please, Mollie.
- No, Mollie. No.

01:15:01.839 --> 01:15:05.360
He can get his own. Just for me, please.

01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:13.299
How long has that been?

01:15:14.056 --> 01:15:16.675
It's gotta be
three or four years at least.

01:15:17.301 --> 01:15:18.400
Riverside.

01:15:18.401 --> 01:15:22.828
Yeah, the SCCA Divisional Championship.
You broke my finger.

01:15:23.447 --> 01:15:25.444
What was that?

01:15:26.093 --> 01:15:29.095
Nippy...
Nippy bloody thing?

01:15:29.304 --> 01:15:30.903
You did on the arm that thing.

01:15:30.904 --> 01:15:32.639
Yeah. I call that "The Llama bite."

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.089
You named it.

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:37.630
Where'd you learn that?
From the girl scouts?

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:39.378
You wanna go again?

01:15:39.379 --> 01:15:40.835
Here you go.

01:15:41.564 --> 01:15:43.366
- You're an angel.
- Thank you.

01:15:43.585 --> 01:15:45.158
My pleasure.

01:15:45.966 --> 01:15:49.854
I'm about to go to the grocery store.
Anything you think you'll need?

01:15:51.399 --> 01:15:57.130
Ice cream. Ice cream would be good.
And... bread.

01:15:58.462 --> 01:15:59.462
All right.

01:15:59.503 --> 01:16:01.623
No, I'm good. Thank you.

01:16:01.913 --> 01:16:03.499
Thanks, Mol.

01:16:04.402 --> 01:16:06.423
You still taking those for you ticker?

01:16:06.623 --> 01:16:09.082
Only because they're so delicious.

01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:12.271
Go to hell.

01:16:19.577 --> 01:16:21.234
Get it up!

01:16:37.405 --> 01:16:38.776
Sam.

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:41.787
Hey, Peter. Come here.

01:17:00.474 --> 01:17:04.555
There's still a lag when I hit the gas.
Let's get rid of the vacuum secondaries.

01:17:04.556 --> 01:17:07.620
Charlie, get a Holley carb
we're gonna rebuild the throttle assembly.

01:17:07.829 --> 01:17:12.514
Three weeks to Daytona
and it still feels like a bag of squirrels.

01:17:12.515 --> 01:17:15.318
Brake heat.
That's a whole different ball game.

01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:18.347
All right, Petey.
Let's go for that ride.

01:17:26.824 --> 01:17:28.424
What are you doing?

01:17:29.681 --> 01:17:33.022
See that crack?
That's my marker for turn 8.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.642
To slow down?

01:17:38.778 --> 01:17:41.210
Push of brakes and downshift.

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.722
But you'll be going a 150 mph.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.757
Yeah.

01:17:47.758 --> 01:17:49.646
So how do you see it?

01:17:49.647 --> 01:17:55.374
You go fast, but as the car speeds up
everything else slows down.

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:59.818
You don't do that.
You do this. All right?

01:17:59.969 --> 01:18:02.375
And then you see everything.

01:18:04.584 --> 01:18:06.397
Do you set other markers?

01:18:06.398 --> 01:18:11.227
Indeed I do. Lot of them.

01:18:13.714 --> 01:18:17.640
'Cause you can't just push the car hard
the whole way?

01:18:17.641 --> 01:18:18.690
That's right.

01:18:18.691 --> 01:18:24.878
You have to be kind to the car. You feel
the poor thing groaning underneath you.

01:18:25.826 --> 01:18:31.427
If you're gonna push a piece of machinery to
the limit and expect it to hold together,

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:35.786
you have to have some sense
of where that limit is.

01:18:39.013 --> 01:18:44.004
Look out there.
Out there is the perfect line.

01:18:46.147 --> 01:18:47.685
No mistakes.

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:50.755
Every gear change. Every corner.

01:18:52.054 --> 01:18:53.595
Perfect.

01:18:54.799 --> 01:18:56.486
You see it?

01:19:00.123 --> 01:19:01.735
I think so.

01:19:03.415 --> 01:19:05.220
Most people can't.

01:19:06.259 --> 01:19:09.187
Most people don't even know
it's out there. But it is.

01:19:11.333 --> 01:19:13.022
It's there.

01:19:15.553 --> 01:19:17.583
You want some ice cream?

01:19:19.442 --> 01:19:20.803
Yeah.

01:19:21.882 --> 01:19:23.311
Come on then.

01:19:23.457 --> 01:19:25.554
- You know what this marker is?
- What?

01:19:25.662 --> 01:19:28.290
That one.
Pull the finger. You'll find out.

01:19:49.894 --> 01:19:51.944
How much longer
before he comes in?

01:19:52.626 --> 01:19:55.806
We change drivers every 4 hours,
so about 10 minutes.

01:19:55.807 --> 01:19:58.873
Hang on. You're saying Beebe is
a 100 % in charge now?

01:19:58.874 --> 01:20:01.114
Yes. And he wants Miles gone.

01:20:01.407 --> 01:20:03.203
Look, it is personal with this guy.

01:20:03.593 --> 01:20:05.804
Yes. Yes, the leverage
to stick it to you.

01:20:05.805 --> 01:20:08.632
He and the Deuce are flying there tomorrow.
He's gonna tell you in person.

01:20:08.633 --> 01:20:11.136
All he is hoping for
is that you lose your cool.

01:20:11.785 --> 01:20:13.234
It's time to let this go.

01:20:13.235 --> 01:20:15.967
You cannot destroy the whole thing,
not for one goddamn guy.

01:20:15.968 --> 01:20:17.845
- Sure I can.
- But why?

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:21.094
'Cause while we're here talking,
he's out there getting it done.

01:20:29.382 --> 01:20:31.035
Oh, shit!

01:20:31.755 --> 01:20:33.333
He's got brake fail.

01:20:53.347 --> 01:20:56.017
- Get him out!
- Peter! Go inside.

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:57.937
Just stay there!

01:20:58.232 --> 01:21:00.195
- Ken!
- Get him out!

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:04.542
- Hurry!
- Ken!

01:21:11.797 --> 01:21:13.479
Ken!

01:21:19.934 --> 01:21:21.604
The brakes.

01:21:30.895 --> 01:21:36.847
This is rip out. The damned engine.
We can't use it if we can't stop.

01:21:36.848 --> 01:21:40.002
The brakes would last longer
if you slowed down a bit.

01:21:40.003 --> 01:21:42.677
Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose
of the extra power?

01:21:43.448 --> 01:21:46.064
I thought the whole point was
to win the damned race.

01:21:46.459 --> 01:21:52.317
Maybe we could design a new assembly.
Instead of swapping out pads in the pits,

01:21:52.638 --> 01:21:56.985
swap out the entire
braking system, rotors included.

01:21:57.715 --> 01:21:59.027
Put in a fresh one.

01:21:59.141 --> 01:22:02.179
Wait, wait. Pops.
We're allowed to do that?

01:22:02.289 --> 01:22:05.079
I don't know. I don't read French.

01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:14.162
Brakes are a part like any other.
We are allowed to change parts.

01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:14.809
Yes.

01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:16.090
Will we have time to do that?

01:22:16.091 --> 01:22:18.040
I don't know yet, Charlie.

01:22:18.347 --> 01:22:19.894
I'm gonna take him home.

01:22:20.048 --> 01:22:21.118
All right.

01:22:21.259 --> 01:22:23.609
- Sort this shit out.
- I will.

01:22:33.172 --> 01:22:35.606
Have you ever been on fire?

01:22:39.361 --> 01:22:41.493
No. It's never happened to me.

01:22:46.432 --> 01:22:50.515
The suit's flameproof, see.
Keeps heat out.

01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:52.973
Yeah.

01:22:54.057 --> 01:22:58.072
But Lewis Evans burnt to death
in the Moroccan Grand Prix.

01:22:58.073 --> 01:23:00.185
He had a flameproof suit on.

01:23:02.475 --> 01:23:04.033
Yeah, but...

01:23:06.866 --> 01:23:10.142
See, he got stuck.
He couldn't breathe.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:14.844
So as long as you get out
of the car, you're okay.

01:23:18.533 --> 01:23:20.247
Dad got out.

01:23:21.471 --> 01:23:23.774
- He sure did.
- Peter.

01:23:27.585 --> 01:23:30.257
- Bye.
- See ya.

01:23:33.206 --> 01:23:35.281
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:23:35.876 --> 01:23:37.623
What's wrong with you?

01:23:37.975 --> 01:23:41.837
Don't tell me brakes or...
Me and boys kicking the bucket out there.

01:23:41.838 --> 01:23:44.586
It's something to do
with the suits, isn't it?

01:23:46.606 --> 01:23:48.085
It's under control.

01:23:48.086 --> 01:23:49.650
What is it?

01:23:49.651 --> 01:23:52.019
You know how we talked about
you do your thing, I do my thing.

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:53.105
This is my thing.

01:23:53.106 --> 01:23:55.476
- Shel.
- Just trust me, Ken.

01:23:55.885 --> 01:23:57.455
You got a plan?

01:23:58.043 --> 01:23:59.510
Absolutely.

01:23:59.861 --> 01:24:01.335
A good one?

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:03.015
It's high risk.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.979
- How high risk?
- Extremely high risk.

01:24:07.782 --> 01:24:09.770
Well, that's something.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.327
- Glad we had this talk.
- Anytime.

01:24:24.407 --> 01:24:26.802
Mr. Ford. This is a surprise.

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:30.066
Apologies for the
unannounced intrusion, Mr. Shelby.

01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:33.083
A man pays 9 million dollars
for an automobile

01:24:33.084 --> 01:24:35.084
he ought at least be able to see it.

01:24:35.325 --> 01:24:36.917
That sounds reasonable enough.

01:24:36.918 --> 01:24:39.693
- Shelby, can I have a word?
- Sure.

01:24:40.019 --> 01:24:41.185
In private?

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:43.287
Yeah, that would be preferable.

01:24:43.288 --> 01:24:43.917
All right.

01:24:43.918 --> 01:24:48.508
Phil, you wanna take care of Mr. Ford here?
Mr. Ford, that's Phil Remington.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.335
- Of course.
- Come to my office, Leo.

01:24:50.336 --> 01:24:51.510
Pleasure, sir.

01:24:51.716 --> 01:24:53.997
Let me give a little tour of your car.

01:24:54.736 --> 01:25:00.640
We took out 289 small block
and put in 427 7 liter.

01:25:03.713 --> 01:25:05.766
Firstly, I wanna just clear the air.

01:25:06.057 --> 01:25:10.259
I hope that whatever disagreements
between us can just be chopped up to

01:25:10.748 --> 01:25:13.771
natural red-bloodedness
in the heat of battle.

01:25:13.772 --> 01:25:16.498
I appreciate that Leo. Truly I do.

01:25:18.014 --> 01:25:21.496
It falls on me, Shelby,
to inform you that

01:25:21.553 --> 01:25:25.569
I have been appointed overall
Executive Director of the Racing program.

01:25:27.003 --> 01:25:30.705
Now, I do hope that
this won't be a problem between us.

01:25:31.508 --> 01:25:33.973
I assure you, Leo. It will not.

01:25:43.918 --> 01:25:45.329
Hey, Carroll!

01:25:45.968 --> 01:25:46.522
Carroll!

01:25:46.523 --> 01:25:49.318
And what is the top speed
with the 427th?

01:25:49.319 --> 01:25:51.274
Why don't we take it for a spin?

01:25:51.275 --> 01:25:51.972
What?

01:25:51.973 --> 01:25:54.664
Go on, Mr. Ford.
Hope on in. Go on.

01:25:54.665 --> 01:25:55.683
You want me to...

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:57.760
To see what 9 million dollars feel like.

01:26:04.846 --> 01:26:05.942
Open the door!

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.743
Hey! Open the door!

01:26:07.908 --> 01:26:09.738
Open the door!

01:26:12.349 --> 01:26:14.915
Just hold me right there.
And you take my hand.

01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:19.493
Oh, God! I sat on my nuts.

01:26:19.494 --> 01:26:21.991
I'm gonna build the next one
for comfort, don't you worry.

01:26:30.488 --> 01:26:31.785
Open the door.

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:33.156
Sorry sir, if you would just
give me a moment?

01:26:33.157 --> 01:26:34.498
Open the door!

01:26:35.421 --> 01:26:36.327
You ready?

01:26:36.328 --> 01:26:37.702
The name in the middle
of that steering wheel

01:26:37.703 --> 01:26:39.828
should tell you that I was born
ready, Shelby.

01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:41.741
- Hit it.
- Attaboy.

01:26:44.877 --> 01:26:46.029
Oh, that's got a little.

01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:49.655
- Open the door!
- Here we go.

01:26:49.656 --> 01:26:52.321
Here we go, Mr. Beebe.
Are you okay, sir?

01:26:54.702 --> 01:26:56.355
Oh my God!

01:26:57.517 --> 01:27:00.347
Oh my God!

01:27:11.276 --> 01:27:15.498
It's about right now they uninitiated
have a tendency to soil themselves.

01:28:01.712 --> 01:28:03.105
Mr. Ford.

01:28:06.762 --> 01:28:08.320
Are you okay?

01:28:11.573 --> 01:28:14.427
Mr. Ford. You all right?

01:28:14.428 --> 01:28:16.488
I had no idea.

01:28:18.542 --> 01:28:20.278
I had no idea.

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:26.424
I wish my Daddy
were alive to see this.

01:28:28.098 --> 01:28:29.927
To feel this.

01:28:31.147 --> 01:28:34.354
This is not a machine just anybody
can get in and easily control.

01:28:34.355 --> 01:28:37.700
Absolutely not. I had no idea.

01:28:37.701 --> 01:28:39.270
You wanna win Le Mans.

01:28:39.865 --> 01:28:43.331
You really wanna take 1st place,
Ken Miles is the man to do it.

01:28:51.991 --> 01:28:53.550
Good timing.

01:28:53.786 --> 01:28:56.468
He knows this car
because he helped me build it.

01:28:57.705 --> 01:29:01.898
Shelby, you know I've already appointed
Leo Beebe Director of

01:29:01.899 --> 01:29:04.371
Which is exactly
why I'm talking to you.

01:29:05.156 --> 01:29:07.943
You let Ken Miles race Daytona.

01:29:08.377 --> 01:29:09.771
If he wins,

01:29:10.837 --> 01:29:12.770
he get to drive Le Mans.

01:29:15.043 --> 01:29:16.497
And if he doesn't?

01:29:17.308 --> 01:29:20.795
Ford Motor Company gets full ownership
of Shelby American.

01:29:20.905 --> 01:29:23.626
Lock, stock and brand. Forever.

01:29:26.897 --> 01:29:29.515
<i>We're an hour of 6 at the Daytona 24.</i>

01:29:29.672 --> 01:29:32.281
<i>And Fords are dominating the leaderboard.</i>

01:29:33.131 --> 01:29:36.404
<i>Shelby American's Ken Miles
holds a narrow lead over</i>

01:29:36.405 --> 01:29:39.469
<i>the Holman Moody's Ford,
driven by Walt Hansgen.</i>

01:29:40.256 --> 01:29:42.270
I don't bloody think so, Walt.

01:30:01.353 --> 01:30:05.609
This race is not just a test of our cars,
but also our teams.

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:07.742
As you know we have a second team
out there today.

01:30:07.743 --> 01:30:09.482
- Holman Moody?
- That's right.

01:30:15.171 --> 01:30:16.751
Walt's pushing it too fast.

01:30:16.752 --> 01:30:20.366
He's pushing 7000 RPM!
Get the EZ sign out there.

01:30:20.527 --> 01:30:22.315
Come on. Move! Do it now!

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:26.256
Every one of these GTs out there today
is under my direct supervision.

01:30:26.386 --> 01:30:29.282
And, of course, the supervision
of Henry Ford II.

01:30:29.283 --> 01:30:32.301
The drivers. The speed. The strategy.

01:30:32.731 --> 01:30:35.640
Even the RPMs are determined by us.

01:30:39.236 --> 01:30:41.971
<i>Ken Miles is on the furious battle
with Hansgen</i>

01:30:41.972 --> 01:30:43.783
<i>as the custom ground stand.</i>

01:30:47.285 --> 01:30:50.666
<i>Hansgen is taking an appointment.
Miles is to return him on.</i>

01:30:53.263 --> 01:30:54.661
<i>Hansgen takes the lead...</i>

01:31:05.822 --> 01:31:08.316
Oh, blimey! Did you see that?

01:31:16.421 --> 01:31:17.663
We are racing.

01:31:17.992 --> 01:31:20.166
- We are still racing!
- Come on, guys! Let's go!

01:31:20.167 --> 01:31:22.150
- Let's go! Move it!
- He's coming in!

01:31:23.333 --> 01:31:25.069
Let's go! Let's go, guys!
Come on!

01:31:27.338 --> 01:31:28.855
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:36.152
Hansgen is right up our arse.

01:31:36.311 --> 01:31:38.144
If I can get outta the pit
ahead of him.

01:31:38.145 --> 01:31:40.892
She's running hot.
But I think she'll hold.

01:31:42.306 --> 01:31:43.997
She's hot.

01:31:45.704 --> 01:31:47.730
Hey, Walt. Good to see you.

01:31:47.981 --> 01:31:50.604
After I get out of this pit, Shelby.
It's the last time you will.

01:31:50.605 --> 01:31:53.276
Don't worry. We've got rear view mirrors.

01:31:54.411 --> 01:31:56.332
What happened to that Mustang
he took out?

01:31:56.697 --> 01:31:58.065
Don't know yet.

01:31:58.372 --> 01:32:02.661
I can push her harder than 6, Shel.
I can feel it.

01:32:08.443 --> 01:32:10.880
How come these guys's pit
so much faster than we do?

01:32:11.245 --> 01:32:14.452
We got a goddamn
NASCAR crew, that's why.

01:32:14.913 --> 01:32:16.847
- No shit?
- No shit.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.045
Goddamn NASCAR crew.

01:32:25.556 --> 01:32:27.091
Guys, they've already left!

01:32:29.846 --> 01:32:30.846
Hello?

01:32:30.955 --> 01:32:33.014
That's my Mollie. Hello.

01:32:33.593 --> 01:32:34.813
Hi, luv.

01:32:35.041 --> 01:32:36.603
What are you doing?

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:37.676
Just having a...

01:32:37.677 --> 01:32:39.459
Mom, ask him about the brakes!

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:40.975
Go to bed. It's 1 AM.

01:32:40.976 --> 01:32:43.243
- Ask him.
- Go to bed! Now!

01:32:43.822 --> 01:32:45.361
I take it he's not asleep.

01:32:45.362 --> 01:32:47.336
I'm sure he smuggled in the radio.

01:32:48.658 --> 01:32:50.068
He said to ask how are the brakes.

01:32:50.069 --> 01:32:53.930
The brakes. Yes.
Tell him they're working. For now.

01:32:54.447 --> 01:32:56.684
Shelby's been acting very strange.

01:32:57.007 --> 01:33:00.330
Ford's gonna push up
another team with a GT.

01:33:00.331 --> 01:33:04.509
Some sort of a yampy bloody corporate test
or something, I don't know.

01:33:04.647 --> 01:33:06.296
Take a rest whenever you get a chance.

01:33:06.297 --> 01:33:07.753
Sorry, my luv. What you were saying?

01:33:07.754 --> 01:33:09.256
You've only got a few hours.

01:33:09.257 --> 01:33:13.035
I can't hear you very well.
I'm sorry, I can't hear ya. Wish me luck.

01:33:13.184 --> 01:33:15.194
- Good luck.
- I love you, darling.

01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:20.384
<i>After 23 hours here at Daytona,
Walt Hansgen, driving green and white Ford</i>

01:33:20.385 --> 01:33:24.800
<i>has a heavy lead
over Ken Miles and Shelby America.</i>

01:33:27.418 --> 01:33:30.917
We're locked out, ain't nothing
Miles can do this late in the race.

01:33:31.993 --> 01:33:34.758
Engine's hot, we gotta keep it under 6.

01:34:22.311 --> 01:34:24.275
All right.

01:34:48.985 --> 01:34:50.746
She could come apart.

01:34:50.902 --> 01:34:52.476
One way to find out.

01:34:55.415 --> 01:34:58.049
I thought we were keeping him under 6000.

01:34:58.124 --> 01:34:59.681
Shut up, Don.

01:35:09.235 --> 01:35:11.508
<i>We've only minutes of racing
left here in Daytona.</i>

01:35:11.509 --> 01:35:14.167
<i>Pitched battle for the
win is being raced</i>

01:35:14.168 --> 01:35:16.668
<i>as the #98 Ford makes an
incredible late surge.</i>

01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:19.280
- What's happening?
- He's moving up.

01:35:19.732 --> 01:35:22.279
<i>Ken Miles does prepare for the win...</i>

01:35:31.998 --> 01:35:34.183
White flag! Last lap!

01:35:39.446 --> 01:35:41.782
Miles is pushing him. Hard.

01:35:52.226 --> 01:35:53.685
That's it.

01:36:04.462 --> 01:36:07.670
<i>Ken Miles drives to Walt Hansgen
coming in to the final turn.</i>

01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:40.830
What the hell?

01:36:48.632 --> 01:36:49.805
Come on!

01:36:50.482 --> 01:36:52.301
All right.

01:36:56.022 --> 01:36:57.853
Look at this now.

01:37:02.578 --> 01:37:03.721
Dammit!

01:37:20.582 --> 01:37:22.252
How about that?

01:37:33.596 --> 01:37:34.502
Yes. Leo?

01:37:34.503 --> 01:37:37.015
Mr. Ford, sir. We won.

01:37:38.638 --> 01:37:40.988
We won. Ford won Daytona.

01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:44.928
And which team was it, Leo?

01:37:45.798 --> 01:37:48.751
Shelby American. Miles driving.

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.904
Son of a bitch.

01:37:54.041 --> 01:37:57.401
Where the hell is he?
Hang on. Wait a minute.

01:37:57.769 --> 01:38:00.490
Has someone lost a bulldog on the beach?

01:38:01.276 --> 01:38:03.552
No, no. Come on, Come on.

01:38:07.265 --> 01:38:09.219
Someone get this man a drink.

01:38:27.919 --> 01:38:30.321
In bed you!
What are you doing?

01:38:30.702 --> 01:38:32.488
Dirty stop out.

01:38:32.919 --> 01:38:37.823
I was drawing a map,
so I could follow you on Le Mans.

01:38:41.938 --> 01:38:43.489
Oh God.

01:38:44.423 --> 01:38:46.122
All these buttons.

01:38:46.652 --> 01:38:48.754
Dark pen, very accurate.

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:53.390
- Tell me about the track.
- No, I can't, Petey.

01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:55.582
Please.

01:39:03.772 --> 01:39:05.963
We start at the start line.

01:39:06.677 --> 01:39:10.252
You actually start here, because you
have to run to your car at Le Mans.

01:39:10.253 --> 01:39:11.523
True enough.

01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:16.695
Once your old man
manages to hobble over and pull out.

01:39:17.001 --> 01:39:19.258
- And not hit anyone.
- Yes, right.

01:39:20.934 --> 01:39:24.992
Accelerate, very hard up to Dunlop bridge.

01:39:25.447 --> 01:39:29.896
Road braking away from you.
Then down through the trees to the Esses.

01:39:30.219 --> 01:39:34.808
Accelerate up to Terte Rouge,
critical first gear corner.

01:39:35.227 --> 01:39:41.977
Fast entry, keep your speed up
for your exit onto Mulsanne.

01:39:42.347 --> 01:39:46.312
Long straight-away,
hemmed in by poplars. Top gear.

01:39:46.768 --> 01:39:52.779
210 mph, then down to third,
revs up, ribs are your friend.

01:39:53.338 --> 01:39:58.852
Get a maximum exit. Let the car run free.
Over the brow

01:39:59.141 --> 01:40:05.746
then wham, the Mulsanne Corner.
Accelerate to Arnage.

01:40:06.015 --> 01:40:09.689
Over the rise to the White House.
You get that right and...

01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:17.790
Your first 3.5 minutes of the 24 hours.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:24.668
You can’t make every lap perfect.

01:40:26.226 --> 01:40:28.302
But I can try.

01:40:33.535 --> 01:40:36.860
All right. Off to bed you.

01:40:40.025 --> 01:40:45.307
I will wake you before I leave for France.

01:40:45.721 --> 01:40:47.265
I promise.

01:40:47.438 --> 01:40:49.935
Okay. Goodnight.

01:41:19.890 --> 01:41:22.305
Where is that? Hotel Champier?

01:42:11.639 --> 01:42:13.815
It's gonna rain again tomorrow.

01:42:18.865 --> 01:42:20.686
There's always rain here.

01:42:23.538 --> 01:42:25.535
Start will be dry, though.

01:42:26.691 --> 01:42:28.999
We'll swap back your tires come rain.

01:42:31.338 --> 01:42:32.890
Yeah.

01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:39.592
Might be smart to sleep, bulldog.

01:42:41.421 --> 01:42:42.982
You too.

01:42:43.777 --> 01:42:45.619
I'm not driving.

01:42:48.098 --> 01:42:50.975
That's a bloody shame.

01:42:51.343 --> 01:42:53.754
Hell, I couldn't have made this team.

01:42:58.381 --> 01:43:00.582
I'm gonna walk to first corner.

01:43:02.199 --> 01:43:03.948
I figured.

01:43:14.441 --> 01:43:16.256
Counting on it.

01:43:50.116 --> 01:43:51.398
Hey, Ken.

01:43:51.570 --> 01:43:53.017
Charles.

01:44:07.228 --> 01:44:11.455
If this was a beauty pageant,
we just lost.

01:44:12.612 --> 01:44:14.075
Looks fast. Doesn't it?

01:44:14.524 --> 01:44:16.488
Looks aren't everything.

01:44:20.483 --> 01:44:23.540
Scarfiotti and Bandini
to start for Ferrari.

01:44:29.226 --> 01:44:30.259
You can take him.

01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.579
4 minutes, Ken.
4 minutes, buddy.

01:44:32.758 --> 01:44:35.726
- <i>Live from Le Mans, France.</i>
- Mom! Come on!

01:44:36.268 --> 01:44:38.215
All right. I'm coming.

01:44:38.527 --> 01:44:40.875
<i>The 24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

01:44:45.784 --> 01:44:48.188
<i>Drivers, please take your places.</i>

01:45:06.731 --> 01:45:09.874
- There he is.
- <i>And here they are lined up. Ready to go.</i>

01:46:03.232 --> 01:46:04.677
Bloody Joseph!

01:46:13.810 --> 01:46:15.150
It's all right, son.

01:46:17.896 --> 01:46:19.866
You looked great out there, sir.

01:46:20.516 --> 01:46:22.092
What happened to Miles?

01:46:30.706 --> 01:46:32.475
Bloody hell!

01:46:43.034 --> 01:46:44.249
Bastard!

01:47:19.972 --> 01:47:23.629
<i>After Dunlop Bandini,
Ferrari is in first place.</i>

01:47:27.708 --> 01:47:29.352
Where's Miles?

01:47:31.359 --> 01:47:33.580
- Where the hell is Ken?
- I don't know.

01:47:42.665 --> 01:47:45.219
He's coming in.

01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:47.869
Let's go! Faster! Come on!
Let's Go! Move it!

01:47:48.209 --> 01:47:49.912
I think it's his door.

01:47:49.913 --> 01:47:52.082
<i>That's a rough start for the Ford team.</i>

01:47:55.578 --> 01:47:58.647
The bloody door won't close!

01:47:58.648 --> 01:48:00.915
- All right. All right.
- Maybe it's the heat.

01:48:03.914 --> 01:48:04.770
Try that.

01:48:04.771 --> 01:48:06.979
Shelby! What the hell is wrong?

01:48:07.856 --> 01:48:10.896
- Something's hitting the frame.
- Oh, you're joking, aren't you?

01:48:11.279 --> 01:48:12.918
Guys, get out of the way!

01:48:13.064 --> 01:48:14.761
Get out of the way! Hold.

01:48:16.041 --> 01:48:17.680
Go! Go! Go!

01:48:25.928 --> 01:48:27.900
He's back out. Go!

01:48:54.917 --> 01:48:57.495
<i>Tremendous games for Ken Miles and Ford...</i>

01:48:57.496 --> 01:49:00.238
Come on dad. Come on.

01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:11.014
<i>Ken Miles, Ford. A new lap record.</i>

01:49:11.173 --> 01:49:13.336
<i>3 minutes and 34 seconds.</i>

01:49:29.281 --> 01:49:33.460
Shelby, he's pushing the car too hard.
That's not the plan.

01:49:34.344 --> 01:49:35.908
Plan's changed.

01:50:03.278 --> 01:50:06.445
Lap is 3.34. Track is 8.36.

01:50:06.591 --> 01:50:08.937
Someone tell me the mph!

01:50:17.876 --> 01:50:19.848
<i>3:31.9 that's a...</i>

01:50:19.849 --> 01:50:21.504
Another lap record.

01:50:27.095 --> 01:50:28.739
Let's go. Let's go, boys!

01:50:29.283 --> 01:50:32.041
- Tea is ready, Ken.
- Thank you, Chase.

01:50:32.444 --> 01:50:35.591
- Happy Birthday, old chap.
- Cheers, mate. Great run.

01:50:44.694 --> 01:50:46.494
You're 3 seconds
faster than Gurney.

01:50:46.610 --> 01:50:49.047
If you hadn't blown the
start you'd be in the lead.

01:50:49.131 --> 01:50:51.841
- Can you keep this up?
- Can the car?

01:50:54.245 --> 01:50:59.205
<i>There has been an incident on turn 6.
♪ 18 and ♪26 have collided.</i>

01:51:24.361 --> 01:51:27.633
<i>It appears, Ferrari, #20,
Ludovico Scarfiotti</i>

01:51:27.634 --> 01:51:29.634
<i>has also left the track.</i>

01:51:38.797 --> 01:51:41.625
- All right, watch your head.
- Thank you.

01:51:41.874 --> 01:51:43.880
Have a good dinner, sir.

01:51:44.447 --> 01:51:46.341
McLaren's pitting.

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:52.219
Mr. Ford is probably going
somewhere nice for dinner.

01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:54.132
What do you mean "probably"?

01:51:54.133 --> 01:51:55.457
Rain's coming.

01:51:55.627 --> 01:51:56.878
All right.

01:52:12.605 --> 01:52:14.110
Coming in.

01:52:22.543 --> 01:52:24.707
- Engine's running hot, Pops.
- All right.

01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:26.399
She's hot, mate. Break on.

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:30.716
Tire.

01:52:37.398 --> 01:52:40.247
- We're 220. We're okay.
- All right.

01:52:44.457 --> 01:52:46.362
- Let's go.
- Swap that out.

01:52:57.353 --> 01:52:58.708
Go! Go!

01:53:06.171 --> 01:53:07.753
I need a stopwatch.

01:53:37.648 --> 01:53:42.003
<i>Lorenzo Bandini remains
in first place for Ferrari.</i>

01:53:56.524 --> 01:53:58.570
Easy, Dan. You're getting boxed in.

01:53:58.571 --> 01:54:00.595
He's not backing,
and a full wicked that one.

01:54:06.468 --> 01:54:08.211
Easy, Dan.

01:54:09.630 --> 01:54:11.232
Bloody hell!

01:54:12.474 --> 01:54:14.515
You arsehole!

01:54:35.449 --> 01:54:36.992
You wanker!

01:54:44.004 --> 01:54:46.796
Face like a sprat arse, don't ya?

01:55:00.255 --> 01:55:04.484
<i>Porsche #58 with an unidentified Ford
are run off the track.</i>

01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:18.173
Nice stopwatch.

01:55:18.553 --> 01:55:20.643
You want one? They're Italian.

01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:46.791
<i>Ken Miles in Ford #1,
and Bandini in Ferrari 21</i>

01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:48.494
<i>are locked in the battle
against the elements</i>

01:55:48.495 --> 01:55:50.496
<i>as they push their cars to the limit.</i>

01:55:50.497 --> 01:55:52.395
<i>Passed the White House corner.</i>

01:56:00.659 --> 01:56:03.662
Yes, sir? Yes, sir.

01:56:06.455 --> 01:56:08.143
Okay, sir.

01:56:14.935 --> 01:56:16.203
Hey!

01:56:18.425 --> 01:56:19.879
Give me that.

01:56:22.028 --> 01:56:23.335
Dumbass.

01:56:23.336 --> 01:56:24.838
Mr. Shelby.

01:57:07.148 --> 01:57:08.729
Here we go.

01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:14.143
Come on, girl. Come on.

01:57:20.123 --> 01:57:22.159
Hold it together now.

01:57:40.513 --> 01:57:41.368
Come on!

01:57:41.374 --> 01:57:46.415
<i>Leader at this moment is Ferrari #21,
being driven by Lorenzo Bandini.</i>

01:57:46.416 --> 01:57:49.028
His brakes are shot.
All right. Here we go.

01:57:49.147 --> 01:57:53.668
<i>It looks like Ken Miles is bringing
the #1 Ford into the pits very slowly.</i>

01:57:57.196 --> 01:57:59.832
Brakes! Nothing! Gone!

01:58:00.136 --> 01:58:02.041
All right. Let's go! Let's Go!

01:58:03.630 --> 01:58:06.401
I had him! I almost had him!

01:58:08.246 --> 01:58:10.669
He's putting another lap on us now.

01:58:14.471 --> 01:58:16.218
Now! Now! Faster!

01:58:20.352 --> 01:58:22.352
They're doing it! The brakes!

01:58:25.186 --> 01:58:26.984
Faster! Faster!

01:58:46.077 --> 01:58:48.933
Against the rules.
You can't just change things.

01:58:48.934 --> 01:58:49.938
No, no, no.

01:58:49.939 --> 01:58:51.790
You show me where it says in your book

01:58:51.791 --> 01:58:56.155
that we cannot swap out the system
and then you can disqualify us.

01:58:56.156 --> 01:58:58.067
- This is not legal.
- Calm down. Calm down.

01:58:58.068 --> 01:58:58.901
This is not legal.

01:58:58.902 --> 01:59:01.215
You show me where it
says in that little rule book

01:59:01.216 --> 01:59:03.630
where I can't swap out
my upright assembly.

01:59:03.631 --> 01:59:04.745
A part is a part.

01:59:04.746 --> 01:59:06.690
Be it a brake caliper or a rotor
or an upright assembly

01:59:06.691 --> 01:59:08.696
and I can swap out
any damn thing I want to.

01:59:09.855 --> 01:59:11.615
We read your damn rule book.

01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:19.762
Bandini's pitting! He's pitting!

01:59:27.079 --> 01:59:29.808
What a shame. I think he blew the line.

01:59:30.063 --> 01:59:31.967
He was trying to keep up with you.

01:59:41.466 --> 01:59:43.819
I don't speak Italian, but he ain't happy.

01:59:55.084 --> 01:59:57.664
Get me out of here, Pops.
Come on!

01:59:58.696 --> 02:00:00.229
Almost set, Ken.

02:00:05.876 --> 02:00:08.038
You can still take him,
but you gotta pass him twice.

02:00:08.039 --> 02:00:10.173
I got it. Pass him twice.

02:00:17.113 --> 02:00:22.508
<i>Ford #1, driven by Ken Miles is back on.
Hot on the heels of Bandini in Ferrari 21.</i>

02:01:20.423 --> 02:01:23.528
Not bloody got it off me, are you?
Comes on!

02:01:24.165 --> 02:01:25.961
He's off his pace.

02:01:27.186 --> 02:01:29.223
He doesn't trust the car yet.

02:01:29.625 --> 02:01:32.502
Come on, Ken.
I gave you the new brakes, buddy.

02:01:38.490 --> 02:01:40.039
All right.

02:01:41.333 --> 02:01:43.128
What'd you come here for?

02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:47.307
Let's do it.

02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:13.108
See? Come on!

02:02:24.216 --> 02:02:25.939
He ain't done it yet.

02:02:29.365 --> 02:02:31.435
He needs to take another lap on him.

02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:59.069
- He needs to pit soon.
- He needs to catch Bandini first.

02:03:09.527 --> 02:03:11.132
All right, you bastard.

02:03:12.308 --> 02:03:13.904
Let's do this again.

02:03:43.296 --> 02:03:44.459
Come on, girl.

02:03:45.002 --> 02:03:47.563
That's my girl! That's my girl!

02:04:07.204 --> 02:04:09.950
Oh my God!

02:04:10.473 --> 02:04:12.217
Bloody hell!

02:04:25.673 --> 02:04:27.998
He did it. We're in the lead.

02:04:28.323 --> 02:04:29.696
Are we in the lead?

02:04:29.810 --> 02:04:31.543
What about Bandini?

02:04:32.278 --> 02:04:33.891
Where's Bandini?

02:04:34.294 --> 02:04:37.844
He's done. Finished. Ferrari's over.

02:04:37.845 --> 02:04:39.972
McLaren's 4 minutes behind him in a GT.

02:04:39.973 --> 02:04:43.864
Should we line them: Ken first,
and 2 and 3. All Fords.

02:05:05.679 --> 02:05:07.404
The Deuce is coming.

02:05:16.079 --> 02:05:19.089
Ken's up in a half an hour.
Do you want me to wake him?

02:05:19.090 --> 02:05:20.854
No, let him sleep.

02:05:22.166 --> 02:05:24.003
- Unbelievable.
- Thank you.

02:05:24.287 --> 02:05:26.242
- Good job.
- Not quite there yet, but...

02:05:27.611 --> 02:05:29.288
There he is.

02:05:31.148 --> 02:05:32.833
Brief me, Leo.

02:05:33.103 --> 02:05:35.454
We're running one, two, three, Mr. Ford.

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.750
- Who's in the lead?
- Him. Miles.

02:05:41.595 --> 02:05:43.655
I was thinking, Mr. Ford.

02:05:44.082 --> 02:05:47.176
Wouldn't it be great
if all three fords lined up

02:05:47.177 --> 02:05:50.216
across the finish line
the exact same time?

02:05:50.406 --> 02:05:52.486
They'll line up and came home together.

02:05:52.487 --> 02:05:55.157
Ford. Ford. Ford.

02:05:55.614 --> 02:05:57.700
I don't think we can actually do that, sir.

02:05:58.899 --> 02:06:00.312
Why not?

02:06:00.995 --> 02:06:06.034
Miles is laps ahead, Leo.
What would you have him to, slow down?

02:06:07.533 --> 02:06:09.093
Yeah.

02:06:20.689 --> 02:06:22.610
He thinks it would be
a historic moment for Ford,

02:06:22.611 --> 02:06:24.182
it'll make him a great photograph.

02:06:25.997 --> 02:06:28.500
Shelby, Miles needs to be
a team player here.

02:06:28.831 --> 02:06:30.000
And so do you.

02:06:30.118 --> 02:06:31.994
Are you gonna tell him or
do you need me to?

02:06:33.550 --> 02:06:36.039
Don't go near my driver. Go on.

02:06:37.009 --> 02:06:39.591
- This is what Mr. Ford wants.
- Go on now.

02:06:40.213 --> 02:06:42.253
- He expects loyalty.
- Go on.

02:06:59.130 --> 02:07:02.726
Guys. Stan, come on.
Let's go.

02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:08.007
What'd Beebe want?

02:07:13.962 --> 02:07:15.642
It's off the scale, isn't it?

02:07:21.075 --> 02:07:23.209
They want you to slow down.

02:07:26.977 --> 02:07:28.853
Run that part to me again.

02:07:29.102 --> 02:07:31.087
They want you to slow down.

02:07:33.582 --> 02:07:36.670
You're outshining the car, Ken.
You're 4 minutes up on McLaren.

02:07:36.671 --> 02:07:37.995
The Deuce wants the three fords

02:07:37.996 --> 02:07:40.611
across the finish line:
one, two, three, all together.

02:07:46.316 --> 02:07:49.294
They're asking that you be a team player.

02:07:50.077 --> 02:07:51.949
To make that photograph happen.

02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:55.639
A photograph. That's good.

02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:58.140
That is good!

02:08:00.279 --> 02:08:05.266
Ken, even if you tie for first,
you'll still be first man ever to win

02:08:05.497 --> 02:08:08.426
Sebring, Daytona, Le Mans at the same year.

02:08:08.916 --> 02:08:11.029
You'll have the triple crown.

02:08:20.614 --> 02:08:23.534
I am unable to get you
to follow an order since day one.

02:08:23.892 --> 02:08:26.257
Whatever you wanna do
is fine with me.

02:08:27.590 --> 02:08:29.377
My choice?

02:08:30.465 --> 02:08:32.227
Your choice.

02:08:38.412 --> 02:08:42.067
Engine's running at boiling.
The brakes are shot.

02:08:45.136 --> 02:08:46.625
How was that?

02:08:47.963 --> 02:08:49.032
Taken care of.

02:08:49.217 --> 02:08:52.725
The car is yours, Ken.
Ken, the car is yours.

02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:56.373
Car is yours, Ken.

02:09:29.203 --> 02:09:32.751
<i>It's the Fords that have the cars
to be blaming the top 3 positions.</i>

02:09:32.752 --> 02:09:34.528
What the hell is he doing?

02:09:39.427 --> 02:09:42.115
Don't answer that!
Get away from it!

02:09:42.264 --> 02:09:43.878
Get away from it!

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:13.282
- He's gonna break his own record.
- Shut up!

02:10:22.244 --> 02:10:23.888
Wait for it.

02:10:25.509 --> 02:10:26.946
Wait for it.

02:10:29.944 --> 02:10:31.068
Now.

02:10:36.831 --> 02:10:39.403
Miles!

02:11:14.774 --> 02:11:16.531
Benissimo.

02:11:16.653 --> 02:11:20.167
3:30.6.
That's another record.

02:11:25.834 --> 02:11:28.053
That's a perfect lap.

02:11:28.054 --> 02:11:29.936
<i>And virtually guaranteeing the 1st place</i>

02:11:29.937 --> 02:11:33.413
<i>for Shelby American and
their exciting GT Ford.</i>

02:11:33.546 --> 02:11:40.764
<i>Ken Miles and Shelby American's Ford #1
just beat his own lap record, 3:30.6.</i>

02:11:40.765 --> 02:11:43.757
Bring him in! Right now!
He's outta control!

02:11:44.205 --> 02:11:47.288
Bring him in before he wrecks that car
and we don't finish!

02:11:49.483 --> 02:11:50.839
Bring him in, Shelby!

02:11:50.992 --> 02:11:54.156
Or I will get you banned
from the SCCA and the FIA.

02:11:55.616 --> 02:11:59.830
Ken Miles is behind the wheel, Leo.
That's his car to the finish.

02:13:34.902 --> 02:13:37.143
Come on, lads. Where are you?

02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:49.497
What's he doing?

02:13:50.076 --> 02:13:52.387
Mom, why is he slowing down?

02:14:24.013 --> 02:14:26.453
The three fords are going to
cross the line together.

02:14:26.717 --> 02:14:28.885
Ken Miles slowed down.
He waited for them.

02:14:29.119 --> 02:14:31.645
Dad? No.

02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:32.712
- It's all right.
- Dad.

02:14:32.713 --> 02:14:35.112
It's all right. He's bringing them in.

02:14:35.113 --> 02:14:36.173
<i>Lead by Ken Miles...</i>

02:14:36.174 --> 02:14:39.334
- He's bringing them all in together.
- <i>He's certainly the leader of this group.</i>

02:14:40.093 --> 02:14:41.732
Good for you.

02:14:42.365 --> 02:14:44.100
Good for you, Ken.

02:15:11.371 --> 02:15:13.135
Look at that!

02:15:14.888 --> 02:15:16.485
Well done, Leo.

02:15:36.802 --> 02:15:40.087
Explain to me how he's finished first
if he's not won the race?

02:15:40.133 --> 02:15:44.193
Because McLaren started from further,
so he came into and he won.

02:15:44.252 --> 02:15:45.753
It's not a tie!

02:15:46.079 --> 02:15:48.402
Because McLaren started further
back, they're saying.

02:15:48.403 --> 02:15:51.127
He's traveled a little bit further.
So, he's won and not Ken.

02:15:51.128 --> 02:15:52.906
That's bullshit!

02:15:53.046 --> 02:15:55.024
Shel! Hold on!

02:16:09.067 --> 02:16:11.867
Where is the tie?
Where is the goddamn tie?

02:16:11.991 --> 02:16:12.991
What?

02:16:13.212 --> 02:16:14.212
You son of a bitch!

02:16:14.724 --> 02:16:16.075
- You knew!
- I didn't, I swear.

02:16:16.076 --> 02:16:17.574
Enough!

02:16:20.092 --> 02:16:22.345
Nice race, mate. Cograts.

02:16:44.074 --> 02:16:45.766
Shel!

02:16:49.709 --> 02:16:51.407
They robbed you, Ken.

02:16:51.409 --> 02:16:55.736
<i>Here's the clarification. Both the
drivers finished the race in a heat.</i>

02:16:55.870 --> 02:16:59.342
<i>McLaren has been ruled the winner
as he started from further back.</i>

02:16:59.343 --> 02:17:01.870
Some bullshit technicality.

02:17:15.039 --> 02:17:17.080
I never should've asked you.

02:17:22.699 --> 02:17:24.850
Selling ties, yeah?

02:17:27.129 --> 02:17:28.886
That's what they do.

02:17:30.939 --> 02:17:33.412
You promised me the drive,

02:17:35.550 --> 02:17:37.514
not the win.

02:17:38.014 --> 02:17:40.114
It was a hell of a drive.

02:17:40.639 --> 02:17:42.567
She's a hell of a machine.

02:17:43.026 --> 02:17:44.719
She's fast.

02:17:46.155 --> 02:17:47.927
Could be faster.

02:17:49.472 --> 02:17:52.044
The 7 liters sweet.

02:17:53.805 --> 02:17:59.309
We still need a lighter chassis.
I was thinking bonded aluminum.

02:17:59.406 --> 02:18:05.263
It's a ground up rebuild, but if it works
we can lose a couple of hundred pounds.

02:18:05.412 --> 02:18:07.430
What the hell are we doing here?

02:18:08.754 --> 02:18:11.154
Let me take the shower,
get a cup of tea.

02:18:11.303 --> 02:18:13.061
Have a sandwich or something.

02:18:13.683 --> 02:18:16.081
We gonna get the bastards the next year.

02:18:39.914 --> 02:18:42.474
Got a bit of fuel left in the tank.

02:18:43.427 --> 02:18:47.388
What do you think of those honeycomb
panels. What you were looking for?

02:18:47.388 --> 02:18:49.766
I don't know yet.

02:19:14.139 --> 02:19:16.580
She looks pretty good.

02:19:26.221 --> 02:19:29.977
There's a point at 7000 RPM

02:19:31.098 --> 02:19:33.713
where everything fades.

02:19:35.704 --> 02:19:40.778
The machine becomes weightless.
Just disappears.

02:19:42.196 --> 02:19:47.271
And all that left is a body
moving through space and time.

02:19:50.028 --> 02:19:55.256
7000 RPM, that's where you meet it.

02:19:56.664 --> 02:20:01.432
You feel it coming.
It creeps up on you, close in your ear,

02:20:08.953 --> 02:20:13.772
and asks you a question.
The only question that matters.

02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:23.989
"Who are you"?

02:20:57.123 --> 02:20:58.213
What do you think?

02:20:58.214 --> 02:21:02.850
It's fantastic!
That was really good. Nice and smooth.

02:21:03.818 --> 02:21:06.077
No vibration in the box.
She's really strong.

02:21:06.078 --> 02:21:10.643
You drove her for less than an hour.
You can't tell shit after an hour.

02:21:13.935 --> 02:21:15.868
Hey, Shel.

02:21:25.235 --> 02:21:30.815
Hey, Shell. That guy, the one in the hat.
He's ready to close on those two 427's.

02:21:30.888 --> 02:21:36.909
His and hers. Full freight.
They flew in from Galveston.

02:21:40.691 --> 02:21:43.815
I need you to come outside
for maybe a minute.

02:21:44.271 --> 02:21:46.080
And do what?

02:21:47.374 --> 02:21:49.385
Be Carroll Shelby.

02:21:49.895 --> 02:21:52.755
Tell them a story.
Spin a few magic words.

02:21:53.147 --> 02:21:56.165
What does that mean? Magic words?

02:21:57.141 --> 02:22:00.828
It means, come
outside, and say hello,

02:22:00.829 --> 02:22:02.853
and make them feel good
about their purchase.

02:22:02.862 --> 02:22:06.338
They're getting the damn cars.
That's what they get for their money, Phil.

02:22:06.464 --> 02:22:09.434
Either they want them or they don’t.
Am I some kind of a lounge act?!

02:22:09.550 --> 02:22:12.218
Am I here to talk people into things?!

02:22:23.024 --> 02:22:25.522
It's been 6 months, Shel.

02:22:26.339 --> 02:22:28.421
Six months.

02:22:32.404 --> 02:22:35.251
Sometimes, they don't get
out of the car.

02:23:10.078 --> 02:23:11.925
Peter!

02:23:12.378 --> 02:23:14.960
Peter, come and take the garbage out!

02:23:14.961 --> 02:23:17.125
Mr. Shelby?

02:23:18.125 --> 02:23:19.693
Hello, Pete.

02:23:21.366 --> 02:23:23.422
I remember that wrench.

02:23:24.154 --> 02:23:25.975
My Dad threw it at you.

02:23:27.244 --> 02:23:29.009
I believe he did.

02:23:29.444 --> 02:23:30.735
Why?

02:23:35.578 --> 02:23:38.048
I think I probably
said something to him.

02:23:38.687 --> 02:23:40.470
Called him a few names.

02:23:42.232 --> 02:23:44.046
That's right.

02:23:52.514 --> 02:23:54.689
Do you wanna speak to my Mom?

02:23:54.814 --> 02:24:00.090
I did. I came to say hello
and check in on her.

02:24:04.572 --> 02:24:07.370
Then, I started thinking that sometimes

02:24:09.167 --> 02:24:16.089
the words just are not useful.

02:24:21.798 --> 02:24:24.377
Tools are useful 'cause you
can make stuff with 'em,

02:24:24.378 --> 02:24:26.402
and you can fix stuff with 'em.

02:24:27.423 --> 02:24:28.916
Here.

02:24:29.852 --> 02:24:31.513
Thanks.

02:24:39.646 --> 02:24:42.150
Your Daddy was a...

02:24:44.807 --> 02:24:47.266
He was your friend.

02:24:52.684 --> 02:24:54.608
Yes, he was.

02:24:55.372 --> 02:24:57.114
Yes, sir.

02:25:01.903 --> 02:25:05.338
And he thought
you were just finer than frog fur.

02:25:09.225 --> 02:25:10.941
Peter!

02:25:16.010 --> 02:25:18.478
I think I've gotta go help my Mom.

02:25:20.213 --> 02:25:23.179
What are you doing here then? Go on.

02:25:23.535 --> 02:25:25.619
Bye.
