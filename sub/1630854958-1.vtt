01:30.228 --> 01:32.161
- Say that a journey of
a thousand miles starts

01:32.195 --> 01:33.195
with a single step.

01:34.577 --> 01:37.131
My first step started as
far back as I can remember.

01:38.546 --> 01:41.066
If I said it was easy, I
wouldn't be telling the truth.

01:42.412 --> 01:44.759
I went into the foster
system very young

01:44.794 --> 01:46.244
because my mom's been sick.

01:50.179 --> 01:52.560
Father Edward sure found
a doozy for my last stop

01:52.595 --> 01:54.321
before turning 18.

01:54.355 --> 01:56.840
Thankfully he introduced
me to my faith

01:56.875 --> 01:58.980
and boy did I need it?

02:00.189 --> 02:01.293
My name is David Cutter.

02:02.467 --> 02:03.467
This is my story.

02:32.876 --> 02:35.569
Sheriff Jensen, is
that place a church?

02:37.674 --> 02:39.642
- Oh no. David.

02:39.676 --> 02:44.647
Well, it used to be years
ago, but it's a lodge now.

02:48.685 --> 02:49.686
- What kind of lodge?

02:51.101 --> 02:53.380
- It's where the
Wheelmakers meet.

02:53.414 --> 02:54.519
- Wheelmakers?

02:59.558 --> 03:00.973
What are Wheelmakers?

03:02.837 --> 03:07.256
- Actually not too sure
myself, but they just asked me

03:07.290 --> 03:12.261
to join, but I do know they've
been around a long time.

03:14.401 --> 03:17.197
Hey, so David, you're
new to a small town.

03:18.577 --> 03:21.891
We have a theater and it's
where a lot of the kids your age

03:21.925 --> 03:22.925
like to hang out.

03:25.860 --> 03:28.415
- Yeah. I'm not really
the hanging out type.

03:30.555 --> 03:32.626
- So what do you like to do?

03:32.660 --> 03:34.214
I mean, besides play guitar.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.943
- I don't know.

03:39.978 --> 03:42.981
Do you have gum or mint?

03:43.015 --> 03:44.672
- Yeah. In the glove box.

03:48.952 --> 03:52.266
- "Essentials of
Life", what is this?

03:56.028 --> 03:58.548
- So David, tell me about you.

04:01.931 --> 04:03.588
- There's not
really much to tell.

04:04.796 --> 04:05.796
- You like school?

04:07.833 --> 04:08.833
- I like to read.

04:11.181 --> 04:14.184
- Cool. There's a, actually
we have a record store

04:14.219 --> 04:16.221
that also sells books.

04:23.435 --> 04:25.230
- Have you had a
lot of foster kids?

04:27.681 --> 04:30.062
- No, you're my first.

04:31.892 --> 04:34.791
- Oh. That's different.

04:36.828 --> 04:38.278
- So long story short.

04:39.693 --> 04:42.316
I like kids and I
like small town living

04:42.351 --> 04:45.871
and I like police work.

04:45.906 --> 04:50.876
I come to find out my ex
didn't like any of it.

04:51.636 --> 04:52.706
Yeah. So she left.

04:54.190 --> 04:56.399
But Father Edwards when he
knew that I still wanted

04:56.434 --> 04:58.815
to try foster parenting
thought a teenager

04:58.850 --> 05:00.265
would be easier than a child.

05:01.508 --> 05:02.647
- Well, I can see that.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.137
- Well, here we are.

05:37.613 --> 05:38.993
Here we are.

05:39.028 --> 05:41.133
Obviously this is the kitchen.

05:41.168 --> 05:42.939
We have the dining room there,
behind is the living room.

05:42.963 --> 05:45.931
And then upstairs are the
bathrooms and the bedrooms.

05:46.829 --> 05:49.176
Oh. And that out building.

05:49.210 --> 05:51.730
So I used to be in a band.

05:51.765 --> 05:54.043
So there is a whole lot
of equipment out there

05:54.077 --> 05:56.045
and you are more than
welcome to use it.

05:56.942 --> 05:57.942
- Thanks Rob.

06:03.604 --> 06:04.778
- It's pretty cool, huh?

06:06.711 --> 06:07.711
- Yeah.

06:08.920 --> 06:13.890
- So, I'm brand new at this.

06:16.203 --> 06:18.239
So I guess we should
set some rules.

06:20.552 --> 06:22.382
Start by establishing a curfew.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.901
I'm thinking 10:00
PM during the week.

06:24.936 --> 06:27.007
Midnight on the weekends.
Is that all right?

06:27.939 --> 06:29.112
- Great.

06:29.147 --> 06:30.147
- Okay.

06:31.529 --> 06:33.669
I know it's early,
but if you're hungry,

06:33.703 --> 06:35.049
I could make us something.

06:35.084 --> 06:36.948
- No. I had a
snack on the train.

06:36.982 --> 06:39.399
I'd like to explore the town.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.814
If I could.

06:40.848 --> 06:42.919
What time do you
usually eat dinner?

06:43.886 --> 06:47.234
From 7:00 PM. Got myself.

06:47.268 --> 06:49.374
So if you'll just
be back by then.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.687
Yeah.
Kind of small.

06:51.721 --> 06:53.723
So shouldn't be a problem.

06:55.484 --> 06:57.658
- Okay. I'll be back by seven.

06:57.693 --> 06:58.693
- Okay.

07:50.124 --> 07:51.609
- Excuse me. Hey.

07:52.955 --> 07:54.094
- Yeah.

07:55.060 --> 07:57.200
- I'd like to pay for this.

07:57.235 --> 08:01.308
- "Paradise regained" is a
that for school or something?

08:02.240 --> 08:03.240
Are you new here?

08:04.553 --> 08:08.142
- Yeah. I just moved here
and no, it's not for school.

08:08.177 --> 08:10.524
- Hm. Bummer for you.
- 98 cents.

08:10.559 --> 08:12.319
- Yeah. I'll take it.

08:14.079 --> 08:17.082
Bummer, it's not for school
or bummer I just moved here?

08:17.117 --> 08:18.117
- Both.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.984
- Where is everyone? Church?

08:22.018 --> 08:24.296
- Church. If you
wanna go to church,

08:24.331 --> 08:25.850
you gotta go to next town over,

08:25.884 --> 08:28.715
but the kids usually hang
out the springs on Sunday.

08:30.164 --> 08:31.303
- Why aren't you there?

08:32.891 --> 08:34.134
- Not my scene.

08:54.706 --> 08:55.880
- Yum, this smells good.

08:57.985 --> 08:59.124
I'm sorry am I late?

08:59.159 --> 09:01.299
I thought dinner was at seven.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.335
- It is. I'm sorry.

09:03.370 --> 09:05.165
I was so focused
on your arrival,

09:05.199 --> 09:06.763
that I completely
forgot about a meeting.

09:06.787 --> 09:09.894
I have this evening and
I have to leave right now

09:09.928 --> 09:12.206
unless you'd like me to cancel.

09:12.241 --> 09:14.588
- No, I have a book I can read.

09:14.623 --> 09:17.073
- Okay. Well, let
me fix your bowl.

09:36.334 --> 09:38.647
So you made it to Causeway.

09:40.165 --> 09:41.408
- Yeah. Cool place.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.722
- Well, look, I want
to hear all about it.

09:44.756 --> 09:47.483
I have to go right now, but
will you tell me about it later?

09:53.731 --> 09:54.731
- Goodnight.

10:00.185 --> 10:02.429
- In the presence
of these witnesses,

10:02.463 --> 10:05.535
do you swear to guard the holy
secrets of the Wheelmakers

10:05.570 --> 10:07.123
under penalty of death?

10:07.158 --> 10:08.746
- Hail enlightened master.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.264
- Yes enlightened master.

10:10.299 --> 10:12.404
- Hail enlightened master.

10:12.439 --> 10:14.924
- As we bring this
ceremony to a close,

10:14.959 --> 10:19.584
I now proclaim Rob Jensen
an official Wheelmaker.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.619
- Hail, ho.

10:32.977 --> 10:35.048
- Congratulations, buddy.
You're one of us now.

10:35.082 --> 10:36.082
- Thank you.

10:36.912 --> 10:39.121
Oh so, that was more intense

10:39.155 --> 10:40.122
than I was expecting.

10:40.156 --> 10:41.364
- Yeah, that's just Frank.

10:41.399 --> 10:42.642
- More importantly though.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.160
Boys, where are we
going to celebrate?

10:44.195 --> 10:46.576
- Oh guys. I can't tonight.

10:46.611 --> 10:48.440
I gotta get home
to my foster kid.

10:48.475 --> 10:49.959
- Oh, that's right.

10:49.994 --> 10:52.893
We heard you were getting
a kid. So high school?

10:52.928 --> 10:55.931
- Yeah. Senior starts tomorrow.

10:55.965 --> 10:57.380
- Oh, that's great.

10:57.415 --> 10:58.623
I'll tell you what.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.556
We'll have Blake and
Jayden look out for him.

11:00.590 --> 11:01.522
Show him the ropes.

11:01.557 --> 11:02.627
- Thank you.
- Absolutely.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.455
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

11:03.490 --> 11:04.490
- Sure thing.

11:05.595 --> 11:06.804
- Don't forget your rope.

11:06.838 --> 11:09.530
- Oh yeah. Don't
wanna forget that.

11:10.566 --> 11:11.498
I'll see you guys.

11:11.532 --> 11:12.532
- See you.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.711
And then the
dreaded first day of school.

11:17.746 --> 11:20.196
You see I've been the
new kid lots of times,

11:20.231 --> 11:24.062
but the day got really weird.

11:25.615 --> 11:29.102
- Good morning class today.
We have a special guest.

11:29.136 --> 11:31.449
Please give a warm welcome
to mayor Balspaugh.

11:35.902 --> 11:37.697
- It's that time of year again.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.422
In the traditions of this town,

11:39.457 --> 11:41.942
our senior class has
always led the charge

11:41.977 --> 11:44.807
for the Enshrinement
Firelight festival.

11:44.842 --> 11:47.983
This year in particular
is extra special.

11:52.988 --> 11:57.855
- Oh yes. Come in class.

11:57.889 --> 12:01.444
Class, this is David Cutter.
Today is his first day.

12:01.479 --> 12:03.999
David, there is an empty
desk next to Jayden.

12:11.075 --> 12:12.075
- Check this out.

12:13.663 --> 12:15.400
Looks like we've got a
Jesus-freak in our class.

12:15.424 --> 12:16.597
Boo.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.808
- Class, focus.

12:21.948 --> 12:23.432
Mr. Mayor, please continue.

12:25.779 --> 12:30.404
- I expect everyone to volunteer
their time building floats,

12:30.439 --> 12:33.649
decorating the town
square for the bonfire,

12:33.683 --> 12:37.342
signing up for the
Princess Firelight pageant.

12:39.586 --> 12:42.209
Boys, don't feel left out.

12:42.244 --> 12:43.935
- Hey, you're going
tomorrow night?

12:44.971 --> 12:46.144
- Like I have a choice.

12:47.180 --> 12:49.596
- Hey, that's mine.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.702
What are you gonna do about it?

12:58.881 --> 13:01.194
- Jayden, we teach
kindness here.

13:01.228 --> 13:03.713
And you are being unkind.

13:03.748 --> 13:04.748
- Yes, sir.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.288
Hey. Can I sit here?

13:27.427 --> 13:28.427
- Whatever.

13:36.919 --> 13:38.403
- Are you in a band?

13:38.438 --> 13:40.681
- Dude, not here
to make friends.

13:42.235 --> 13:43.235
- Sorry.

13:46.066 --> 13:47.066
I play guitar.

14:05.568 --> 14:09.952
So the curiosity-killed-the-cat
side of me took over.

14:11.471 --> 14:14.508
I couldn't help, but think
what would possess a town

14:14.543 --> 14:19.065
to turn a church
into well, a lodge?

15:00.313 --> 15:01.866
- Put that back, Kevin.

15:04.144 --> 15:05.801
Better put it back.

15:08.631 --> 15:09.631
- Hello.

15:10.979 --> 15:12.497
- Now you did it.

15:12.532 --> 15:14.948
He sure did.

15:14.983 --> 15:17.054
- What? What's your name?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.643
Holio.

15:20.678 --> 15:23.715
- My name's Olguita.
And this is Kevin.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.166
Will you be my friend?

15:26.201 --> 15:28.755
- Mm. Yes, I'll be your friend.

15:33.277 --> 15:34.277
- Hey. Hey.

15:35.658 --> 15:40.629
- Wow. How did you do that?

15:41.768 --> 15:43.770
It's magic.

15:43.804 --> 15:46.497
Why don't you be a good
little girl and get

15:46.531 --> 15:48.809
that dagger on the table.

15:48.844 --> 15:50.432
- Okay. I'll do it.

15:54.332 --> 15:57.473
Let's test
its sharpness, shall we?

15:57.508 --> 15:59.510
- You mean this?

15:59.544 --> 16:01.305
Show me how it works.

16:01.339 --> 16:03.583
- Okay. If I have to.

16:06.344 --> 16:08.484
Like this.

16:14.111 --> 16:15.111
- Kevin.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.323
Little girl, Kevin.

16:26.882 --> 16:31.335
- We've got to go. We can't
be in here. Come on Kevin.

16:47.144 --> 16:48.144
- Boo.

16:49.146 --> 16:51.596
- Oh my God. Miss
Leann you scared me.

16:51.631 --> 16:53.529
- I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

16:53.564 --> 16:54.668
Why aren't the lights on?

16:54.703 --> 16:56.360
- Oh, I am so sorry.

16:56.394 --> 16:58.707
I don't even realize is
getting that dark. I'm so busy.

16:58.741 --> 17:01.882
- Well, no need to cook
tonight. We have pizza.

17:01.917 --> 17:02.917
- Okay.

17:04.126 --> 17:05.138
Is there anything else
I can do for you then?

17:05.162 --> 17:06.749
- No. Join us.

17:06.784 --> 17:08.372
Where are Olguita and Gomez?

17:08.406 --> 17:13.377
- Olguita is actually doing
her homework and Gomez.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.899
Olguita please come
down, there's pizza.

17:22.213 --> 17:27.184
There you go, Olguita.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.604
- It's delicious.

17:38.505 --> 17:39.886
You haven't said grace yet.

17:41.232 --> 17:43.027
Sorry.

17:45.995 --> 17:47.238
- All right, let us pray.

17:48.515 --> 17:49.872
Thank you God for
the bountiful food

17:49.896 --> 17:51.656
that we were about to eat.

17:51.691 --> 17:54.383
Thank you for good
friends and happy smiles.

17:54.418 --> 17:57.421
And a wonderful family
You have bestowed upon us.

17:57.455 --> 17:59.492
In Your name we pray, amen.

18:34.768 --> 18:37.046
- So cold in here.

18:37.081 --> 18:39.083
Why is this so freezing?

18:42.224 --> 18:44.537
- Where did these things
damn things come from?

18:46.470 --> 18:50.094
Every day. Every day.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.545
Every day is always
something different.

18:52.579 --> 18:53.729
- Why? What else has happened?

18:53.753 --> 18:55.203
How do we stop this?

19:00.242 --> 19:01.623
- Yo, this is messed up.

19:02.555 --> 19:04.004
- It's too creepy.

19:04.039 --> 19:05.351
I gotta get outta here.

19:05.385 --> 19:07.180
- Leann. Do not
leave this house.

19:07.215 --> 19:08.215
It's a school night.

19:19.779 --> 19:20.987
- Snap out of it.

19:33.620 --> 19:36.002
- It's just so weird.

19:37.417 --> 19:40.696
All this creepy shit has
been happening at the house.

19:40.731 --> 19:42.664
I mean, it's like,
because we're on the cusp

19:42.698 --> 19:45.253
of my 18th birthday the gates
of hell are gonna open up

19:45.287 --> 19:47.116
and swallow my family whole.

19:47.151 --> 19:50.534
Oh, oh. And my birthday falls
on a full moon on Halloween.

19:51.949 --> 19:52.743
- Dramatic much.

19:52.777 --> 19:54.020
- No, seriously.

19:54.054 --> 19:56.264
None of this happened
before. Why now?

19:56.298 --> 19:57.748
What's the change?

19:57.782 --> 20:00.578
Oh, my God. Am I never
allowed to lead Mission Point?

20:00.613 --> 20:02.718
Is this the universe telling
me I can't go to college

20:02.753 --> 20:04.203
and get the hell
out of this place?

20:04.237 --> 20:05.963
- Babe. Babe chill.

20:07.309 --> 20:09.277
Obviously your housekeeper
left a window open

20:09.311 --> 20:13.557
while they were cleaning
and the flies were drawn

20:13.591 --> 20:15.283
to the stench of Gomez.

20:15.317 --> 20:17.388
- Stop. That's not nice.

20:17.423 --> 20:18.423
- Whatever.

20:19.425 --> 20:21.220
It was fine when
we were just kids.

20:21.254 --> 20:25.085
But now it's weird that they
still live in your guest house.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.949
Didn't your dad paid
them enough to move?

20:26.984 --> 20:29.400
- You sound jealous
and that's idiotic.

20:29.435 --> 20:31.402
Let's go back to
talking about me.

20:31.437 --> 20:32.438
- I've a better idea.

21:25.974 --> 21:28.148
- Son must find sacrifice.

21:34.672 --> 21:36.605
18th birthday.

21:39.056 --> 21:40.056
Full moon.

21:44.026 --> 21:45.545
Yes, master.

21:55.693 --> 21:56.901
- Good morning.

22:01.734 --> 22:04.184
- What time did you
come home last night?

22:05.427 --> 22:06.635
- Does it matter?

22:06.670 --> 22:08.430
- It matters. I
should punish you.

22:08.465 --> 22:09.673
- Go ahead.

22:09.707 --> 22:11.202
- I can't do that with
the Enshrinement parade

22:11.226 --> 22:12.641
and festival coming up.

22:12.676 --> 22:14.274
How would it look if
their own mayor's daughter

22:14.298 --> 22:15.817
didn't make an appearance?

22:15.851 --> 22:17.726
- It would look like there's
disharmony in the household,

22:17.750 --> 22:18.889
which there is.

22:18.923 --> 22:20.787
- Don't raise your
voice to me young lady.

22:20.822 --> 22:23.411
- I can do whatever I want.
You just made it clear.

22:23.445 --> 22:24.377
You can't ground me.

22:24.412 --> 22:26.724
- Leann, I demand some respect.

22:26.759 --> 22:28.761
- Ugh. I can't wait
to go to college.

22:41.808 --> 22:42.808
- Frankie.

22:46.192 --> 22:49.229
- You're lucky, Rosita,
Gomez is a good boy.

22:50.610 --> 22:52.992
- He has his moments.

22:53.026 --> 22:54.925
Olguita on the other hand,

22:54.959 --> 22:56.789
I don't know how
she's gonna turn out.

22:58.446 --> 23:00.216
- It's hard for a girl
to grow up without a mom.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.656
I did the best I could.

23:12.598 --> 23:14.289
- Wheelmaker meeting?

23:14.323 --> 23:16.325
- Yeah, but it
shouldn't be that long.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.775
You have homework?

23:17.810 --> 23:18.810
- I do.

24:56.115 --> 24:57.634
- And as a Wheelmaker, fellows,

24:57.668 --> 25:00.326
you're gonna have connections
for the rest of your lives.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.086
We're like a family here.

25:02.121 --> 25:05.089
We're gonna help you get
into the best schools.

25:05.124 --> 25:09.749
Find the best careers and heck
we might even help you find

25:09.784 --> 25:10.784
your soul mate.

25:12.027 --> 25:13.546
- Well, it's true.

25:13.581 --> 25:15.628
My father was a Wheelmaker
and it was his connections

25:15.652 --> 25:17.308
that got me into
Tufts undergrad.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.898
Let's face it. It wasn't
done on my grades alone.

25:30.252 --> 25:33.911
- You look as
uncomfortable as I feel.

25:33.946 --> 25:37.190
- Yeah, this isn't
really my thing,

25:37.225 --> 25:39.434
but my mom works
for Mr Balspaugh,

25:39.468 --> 25:42.023
he's kind of been like
a father figure to me.

25:43.507 --> 25:45.026
- I get it.

25:45.060 --> 25:47.235
So you're kind of doing
this out of respect.

25:48.201 --> 25:49.375
- I guess.

25:49.409 --> 25:51.135
- Thank you everyone
for coming out.

25:51.170 --> 25:53.724
We've met some impressive
young men and look forward

25:53.759 --> 25:55.933
to speaking to some
of you further.

26:05.046 --> 26:07.082
- As a member of the
Supreme High Council

26:07.117 --> 26:09.602
of the Wheelmakers, I
proclaimed this meeting

26:09.637 --> 26:11.397
has come to order.

26:11.431 --> 26:16.057
- Hail, ho. We come in they
name, benevolent master

26:16.091 --> 26:18.784
and invite thee to
inhabit each of us

26:18.818 --> 26:21.890
that we may please thee
with the words we speak.

26:21.925 --> 26:22.925
Hail.

27:00.826 --> 27:03.760
And with this
blood of goat, we seal

27:03.794 --> 27:05.451
our commitment to secrecy.

27:11.181 --> 27:14.598
- Brothers, our
problem is solved.

27:16.082 --> 27:18.844
I will pass on the torch
at the appointed moment.

27:18.878 --> 27:20.466
- So you found
your long lost son?

27:20.500 --> 27:23.089
- Shouldn't the torch be passed
before his 18th birthday?

27:23.124 --> 27:27.576
- Have faith. The benevolent
master will provide.

27:27.611 --> 27:30.303
It requires obedience.

27:30.338 --> 27:35.308
Total obedience, total
unquestioned obedience.

27:36.620 --> 27:40.141
A human offering
will be required.

27:40.175 --> 27:42.626
- Is he saying what?
I think he's saying.

27:42.661 --> 27:47.666
- This young, innocent
soul will be called upon

27:48.943 --> 27:50.738
on the Eve of Enshrinement
and full moon.

27:52.463 --> 27:55.570
I will read you what
my Lord told me.

28:01.541 --> 28:05.062
I shall give thee a
heir, but in return,

28:05.097 --> 28:05.994
thou must sacrifice to me

28:06.029 --> 28:09.032
whomever enters the sanctuary

28:09.066 --> 28:11.068
before the clock
strikes midnight

28:11.103 --> 28:13.692
on the Eve of Enshrinement.

28:13.726 --> 28:16.556
If not disaster
shall befall thee.

28:21.423 --> 28:23.356
There's no turning back boys.

28:23.391 --> 28:25.704
It's my solemn vow.

28:25.738 --> 28:28.637
The wheels are turning.

28:28.672 --> 28:29.672
- So mote it be.

28:30.605 --> 28:31.917
- So mote it be.

28:44.412 --> 28:47.484
Greetings,
children of the earth.

28:47.518 --> 28:50.901
I've been waiting for
our time together.

28:50.936 --> 28:54.594
Oh my, I can sense
all of you around me.

28:54.629 --> 28:57.321
I can even see some of you.

28:57.356 --> 29:00.393
Have you embraced the
spirit world today?

29:00.428 --> 29:03.017
Have you learned how
to protect yourselves

29:03.051 --> 29:05.813
from all negative
energy and influence?

29:05.847 --> 29:07.469
- Man, this town is so weird.

29:07.504 --> 29:10.265
Learn how,
it's all in my new book,

29:10.300 --> 29:11.922
"The supernatural in you".

29:11.957 --> 29:16.340
Remember this, tomorrow I
will be at Causeway Record

29:16.375 --> 29:21.345
and Books signing autographed
copies of "The supernatural

29:22.243 --> 29:24.279
and you" from two to 7:00 PM.

29:25.246 --> 29:28.214
I'm sure I will see you there.

29:36.395 --> 29:38.569
- How's your first week going?

29:38.604 --> 29:39.778
- Okay. I guess.

29:42.159 --> 29:43.989
- Anything special
planned for today?

29:45.093 --> 29:46.681
- I was gonna swing by Causeway.

29:49.477 --> 29:52.721
- Oh, have you met
Jayden Blake yet?

29:52.756 --> 29:55.794
- Yeah, we don't have that
much in common really.

29:57.036 --> 29:58.036
- Hmm.

30:02.559 --> 30:04.699
- I don't really fit
in with the cool kids.

30:07.529 --> 30:08.565
- Keep trying.

30:12.776 --> 30:13.776
Give it time.

30:19.438 --> 30:22.993
- There goes a servant
of the most high God.

30:23.028 --> 30:27.273
Why are you here servant
of the most high God?

30:27.308 --> 30:29.482
Have you come to destroy us?

30:37.801 --> 30:41.218
Your face.

30:41.253 --> 30:45.360
Servant of the high
God, I see you.

30:49.019 --> 30:53.403
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

30:58.615 --> 30:59.823
- Dude.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.101
- Demon chasing. Let's
go. We have to go.

31:02.136 --> 31:05.001
- Olguita, what
are you doing here?

31:05.035 --> 31:06.416
Does mom know where you are?

31:08.383 --> 31:11.041
- What? She's your sister?

31:11.076 --> 31:12.076
- Yeah. What of it?

31:13.733 --> 31:15.908
- Got to sit down for a sec.

31:15.943 --> 31:17.496
- Olguita, go home.

31:20.948 --> 31:22.121
What are you doing, man?

31:24.848 --> 31:28.196
- I heard you playing and
wanted to see who it was.

31:28.231 --> 31:30.612
- Frank lets me practice here.

31:30.647 --> 31:31.855
The guest house is too small

31:31.890 --> 31:33.512
and my mom doesn't
like the noise.

31:35.031 --> 31:37.171
- It's a little musty in here.

31:37.205 --> 31:38.205
- Right?

31:39.518 --> 31:42.762
It's the only choice I got.
Unless you have a better idea.

31:42.797 --> 31:45.662
- Why don't you
come to Rob's house?

31:45.696 --> 31:47.767
- Just don't try to save me.

31:47.802 --> 31:49.459
I see you carrying
around your Bible.

31:49.493 --> 31:51.910
I'm not all into that. Got it?

31:53.877 --> 31:56.397
- Got it. I'll leave you to it.

32:12.413 --> 32:16.210
- Servant of the high
God, I'm coming for you.

32:57.354 --> 32:59.770
- What is your name?

32:59.805 --> 33:01.289
- My name is David.

33:01.324 --> 33:02.324
- Hmm.

33:06.398 --> 33:09.608
And what is your interest
in the supernatural?

33:11.955 --> 33:13.646
- I never really
thought about it

33:13.681 --> 33:15.234
until I came to Mission Point.

33:17.926 --> 33:21.068
- Yes. This place has
that effect on people.

33:25.279 --> 33:26.279
- Oh.

33:36.290 --> 33:37.290
- You're back.

33:38.740 --> 33:42.330
- I saw her on
TV. I was curious.

33:42.365 --> 33:44.505
- Yeah. She's kinda
like a local celebrity,

33:44.539 --> 33:47.025
but what is with you and
all this spiritual stuff?

33:47.991 --> 33:49.958
- I don't know.

33:49.993 --> 33:51.684
I find it interesting.

33:51.719 --> 33:54.032
- Okay. Whatever. It's
a little weird, right?

33:55.171 --> 33:58.726
- That seems
hypocritical. Nice look.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.590
- This is fashion.

34:01.901 --> 34:04.663
- So what do you like to do?

34:05.802 --> 34:07.459
- Mm, well, you're
looking at it.

34:08.322 --> 34:09.909
- Work at a bookstore?

34:09.944 --> 34:12.498
- Well, I'm trying to save
enough money to move out.

34:14.086 --> 34:15.915
- Is that even possible?

34:15.950 --> 34:18.228
It seems like no one
gets away from this town.

34:18.263 --> 34:21.611
- Well, I've got
plans. Big plans.

34:21.645 --> 34:23.682
- Like what? Move to Hollywood?

34:23.716 --> 34:26.340
- Something like that. I sing.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.688
- I play guitar.

34:29.722 --> 34:31.172
Do you wanna play sometime?

34:31.207 --> 34:32.207
- Sure. I'm done.

34:37.178 --> 34:38.352
- I'll text you.

34:38.386 --> 34:39.386
- Yeah.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.569
- Dude, that's so
totally killer.

34:48.603 --> 34:50.364
Didn't expect that
to come from you.

34:51.330 --> 34:52.573
- Why?

34:52.607 --> 34:53.998
- Everybody knows Jesus
people don't play rock

34:54.022 --> 34:55.748
and roll devil music.

34:55.783 --> 34:58.889
Good Christian boys like you
only play easy listening,

34:58.924 --> 35:01.168
joyful like choir music, yeah.

35:01.202 --> 35:02.893
Organ music, right?

35:04.585 --> 35:05.585
- Look.

35:14.250 --> 35:15.941
Mighty Jesus, set him free.

35:18.495 --> 35:20.635
The drums are over
there if you wanna play.

35:20.670 --> 35:21.774
- Hell, yeah.

35:26.331 --> 35:28.471
One, two, three, four.

35:59.674 --> 36:01.814
Dude, that was so lit.

36:01.849 --> 36:04.162
- Jesus can rock, Gomez.

36:04.196 --> 36:07.958
And I've been thinking how
cool it would be to start

36:07.993 --> 36:09.270
a Christian rock band.

36:09.305 --> 36:11.721
- Yeah, I was in a band
once, but it sure wasn't

36:11.755 --> 36:13.274
a Christian band.

36:13.309 --> 36:15.345
- Yeah. What'd you
call yourselves?

36:16.553 --> 36:17.692
- Adrammelech.

36:18.624 --> 36:21.558
- Sounds weird. Where's it from?

36:21.593 --> 36:22.801
- The Bible.

36:22.835 --> 36:26.356
- Really? From where?
A personal place?

36:26.391 --> 36:30.533
- A demon. David, you mean
you haven't read about it

36:30.567 --> 36:32.707
in that Bible of yours?

36:32.742 --> 36:34.813
- I haven't been a
believer for that long.

36:36.021 --> 36:37.885
- Well, it's in there.

36:39.956 --> 36:42.372
- Why did you name your
band after a demon?

36:42.407 --> 36:45.582
- Dude, it's just a name.

36:45.617 --> 36:48.309
There's no such thing as demons.

36:48.344 --> 36:50.104
How long are you gonna
believe in that trash.

36:50.138 --> 36:52.279
- There's spirits all around us.

36:52.313 --> 36:54.626
Ever feel like we're not alone?

36:54.660 --> 36:57.007
- No. Do you?

36:57.042 --> 36:58.285
- Yes. All the time.

36:59.527 --> 37:00.849
Ever since I moved
to Mission Point,

37:00.873 --> 37:02.668
I feel like we're being watched.

37:03.842 --> 37:06.983
- You are, everyone's
watching you.

37:07.017 --> 37:08.017
You're the new kid.

40:24.801 --> 40:25.801
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:27.045 --> 40:29.219
- Not at all what
I was expecting.

40:29.254 --> 40:30.531
- What were you expecting?

40:32.775 --> 40:34.121
- I don't know.

40:34.155 --> 40:36.503
Something, a little
darker, angrier.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.024
- So I hear a window open
up on the second floor.

40:41.059 --> 40:43.233
I see my dad stick his
head out and he says to me,

40:43.268 --> 40:44.683
"More free periods."

40:46.133 --> 40:47.893
And now for the talented Danny.

40:49.688 --> 40:52.967
- Thank you. Thank
you. Thank you, Jeff.

40:54.210 --> 40:56.626
- Shh, quiet.

40:56.661 --> 40:59.526
There are worried
whispers in the air.

40:59.560 --> 41:03.046
I was once told that the
divine speaks easy to those

41:03.081 --> 41:08.051
with open ears, intuitive
woman holding beauty and power.

41:09.225 --> 41:12.055
Here are ones that
hear God even louder.

41:12.090 --> 41:14.989
- Because I like the color
black doesn't mean I'm angry.

41:15.024 --> 41:16.784
I look good in a black.

41:16.819 --> 41:18.924
- Yeah, you do like.

41:20.339 --> 41:22.549
- So are you sticking
around for the rest of this?

41:22.583 --> 41:24.412
- Unless you want
to do something.

41:24.447 --> 41:26.069
- I can use a walk.

41:26.104 --> 41:27.588
- Sure.

41:27.623 --> 41:32.248
- For a heart so pure, so
human is what they're after.

41:33.387 --> 41:36.079
Tic toc as the moon fully glows

41:36.114 --> 41:38.772
There's only a few
of us who truly know.

41:39.980 --> 41:43.535
Men, women with
beauty and power.

41:43.570 --> 41:46.676
- Okay, new guy. Tell me
a little about yourself.

41:46.711 --> 41:48.367
- I wouldn't know
where to start.

41:48.402 --> 41:50.749
- You know the basics.
Where were you born?

41:50.784 --> 41:53.200
Why are you here? What's to
do with the religious books.

41:53.234 --> 41:54.304
Where'd you come from?

41:55.202 --> 41:56.341
- I guess I was from here.

41:56.375 --> 41:57.791
- Huh?

41:57.825 --> 41:59.344
Here, like here, here.

41:59.378 --> 42:01.967
This is a very small town
where everyone knows everyone.

42:02.002 --> 42:03.279
What's your last name?

42:04.176 --> 42:05.592
- Cutter.

42:05.626 --> 42:07.362
- Yeah. I don't think
that's a name in this town.

42:07.386 --> 42:09.561
- Make it sound like
we're all related.

42:09.596 --> 42:11.943
- You know Blake.
He's my cousin.

42:11.977 --> 42:13.358
Mom's maiden name is Weaver.

42:15.567 --> 42:17.258
- I'm afraid to ask.

42:17.293 --> 42:18.501
What's your last name?

42:18.536 --> 42:21.366
- Stevens as in Jayden
is my older brother.

42:23.195 --> 42:25.277
Yeah. My parents are told
that they couldn't have kids.

42:25.301 --> 42:28.338
So they adopted my brother and
then a year later, surprise.

42:28.373 --> 42:30.271
I popped out.

42:30.306 --> 42:32.653
But why do you think your
born in Mission Point?

42:34.206 --> 42:36.070
- It was something my mom said.

42:36.105 --> 42:37.106
- Where is your mom?

42:38.763 --> 42:41.800
- She's been in and out of
institutions my whole life.

42:41.835 --> 42:43.561
She was diagnosed
with schizophrenia.

42:43.595 --> 42:45.977
So I really don't know.

42:46.011 --> 42:47.254
- Whoa.

42:47.288 --> 42:50.188
- It was almost as if
at times she was saying,

42:50.222 --> 42:53.605
don't go to Mission Point
before you turn 18. I saved you.

42:53.640 --> 42:54.779
- When do you turn 18?

42:55.745 --> 42:56.781
- End of the month.

42:56.815 --> 42:58.610
- Wow. So you listen super well.

43:00.474 --> 43:03.995
- Like I said, it's hard
to tell what's real.

43:04.029 --> 43:06.653
And what's a
reality in her mind.

43:06.687 --> 43:09.069
- What do you think your
mom meant by she saved you?

43:10.070 --> 43:11.312
- I don't know.

43:20.874 --> 43:21.737
What time is it?

43:21.771 --> 43:23.290
- Midnight.

43:23.324 --> 43:24.222
Hide.

43:24.256 --> 43:26.017
- Crap. It's past my bedtime.

43:36.544 --> 43:37.544
- Hail, ho.

43:44.173 --> 43:46.347
- Hey. Did you hear that?

43:46.382 --> 43:47.694
- Yeah. What the hell?

43:56.944 --> 43:59.947
- Prince ruler and
architect of the universe.

43:59.982 --> 44:02.950
You who live in the air,

44:02.985 --> 44:05.504
come forth and inhabit us.

44:05.539 --> 44:09.716
To empower us, may you
delight in your servants

44:09.750 --> 44:12.580
as we delight in your power.

44:12.615 --> 44:16.101
Come forth and
answer to your names.

44:16.136 --> 44:21.106
Pan, Lilith, Sabazios,
Proserpine, Ishtar

44:22.314 --> 44:24.869
and the greatest of all Baleal.

44:26.353 --> 44:28.804
- Let's get a little closer
to see what Rob's saying.

44:42.231 --> 44:44.854
- Wait, that sounds like my dad.

44:46.476 --> 44:47.823
- Come on. Let's go.

44:50.653 --> 44:53.621
- That we may serve
you and each other.

44:53.656 --> 44:57.902
We acknowledge thee Baleal as
our all encompassing master.

45:04.184 --> 45:05.599
- Well, that got weird.

45:05.633 --> 45:07.774
- Yeah, but I had fun.

45:07.808 --> 45:09.223
- Me too.

45:09.258 --> 45:10.915
- So are you free tomorrow?

45:10.949 --> 45:12.675
- Yeah.
- See then.

45:12.710 --> 45:13.711
- Let's see.

45:25.067 --> 45:26.068
- Good morning.

45:27.828 --> 45:29.623
I'd have thought you'd
be sleeping in given

45:29.657 --> 45:32.384
that you got home late
last night, but okay.

45:32.419 --> 45:35.387
I'm gonna let it
slide this time.

45:35.422 --> 45:36.422
- What?

45:38.977 --> 45:39.977
- Who's the girl?

45:40.841 --> 45:42.015
- Zoe Stevens.

45:43.223 --> 45:44.603
- Zoe Stevens.

45:46.502 --> 45:49.263
Look, you know, I'm glad
you're making friends.

45:49.298 --> 45:53.164
Hey David, last
night did you hear,

45:53.198 --> 45:54.234
did you see anything?

45:55.856 --> 45:57.616
- Yeah. What was that?

45:57.651 --> 46:00.758
- I don't know, but I'm
gonna figure it out.

46:04.520 --> 46:07.454
- So I planned on hanging
out with Zoe again today.

46:07.488 --> 46:08.488
Is that all right?

46:09.525 --> 46:13.874
- Yeah. But hey
David, remember curfew

46:13.909 --> 46:15.876
and stay out of the woods.

46:17.326 --> 46:20.363
- Okay. But I thought
everyone hangs out there.

46:22.124 --> 46:23.159
- Things change.

46:37.311 --> 46:39.520
- Jayden, where's Leann?

46:39.555 --> 46:40.936
- She'll be here later.

46:40.970 --> 46:42.144
Hey, where are you going?

46:42.178 --> 46:43.559
- Out.

46:43.593 --> 46:46.527
- Out? You don't
have any friends.

46:46.562 --> 46:48.564
- I'll help later.
Besides you have help.

47:05.892 --> 47:08.998
- Hey Jay, isn't that
Jesus freak down there?

47:10.034 --> 47:11.932
- No, you must be mistaken.

47:13.002 --> 47:13.865
- Look.

47:13.900 --> 47:14.728
- What tha?

47:14.762 --> 47:16.661
- Dude, who cares?

47:16.695 --> 47:19.181
- I care. No, not happening.

47:21.010 --> 47:22.056
- So what you wanna do about it?

47:22.080 --> 47:23.841
- Break them up?
- Yes.

47:24.945 --> 47:26.878
- Call Leann.
She'll have a plan.

47:35.922 --> 47:37.993
- Hey. I wanna mess
with the new kid.

47:38.027 --> 47:39.753
- Don't be such an idiot.

47:39.787 --> 47:41.720
- He's chilling with my sister.

47:41.755 --> 47:43.481
- Olguita, what are you doing?

47:44.482 --> 47:46.415
- I care. She's my sister.

47:46.449 --> 47:48.969
- I mean, the only thing
we know about him is

47:49.004 --> 47:50.453
that he likes God.

47:50.488 --> 47:53.180
- No weirdo religion guy is
gonna be messing with her mind.

47:55.665 --> 47:58.082
- I have a plan, but I gotta go.

47:58.116 --> 47:59.116
I'll see you soon.

48:04.122 --> 48:05.606
Olguita, there you are.

48:07.643 --> 48:10.577
What do you have in your hand?

48:14.201 --> 48:16.410
I think this is my dad's.

48:16.445 --> 48:18.792
Where'd you get it? Olguita?

48:18.826 --> 48:20.104
- Kevin gave it to me.

48:21.588 --> 48:23.831
- Who's Kevin and
where did he get it?

48:23.866 --> 48:25.350
- Kevin, lives in the church.

48:25.385 --> 48:27.145
- What do you mean he
lives in the church?

48:27.180 --> 48:28.767
No one lives in the church.

48:28.802 --> 48:30.114
- Kevin lives there.

48:30.148 --> 48:31.781
He came to me one day
while I was playing.

48:31.805 --> 48:32.771
- What?

48:32.806 --> 48:34.842
- Kevin's always with me.

48:34.877 --> 48:37.845
- You tell Kevin to
go away and I'll put

48:37.880 --> 48:39.917
this Wheelmaker thing
back where you got it

48:39.951 --> 48:41.159
before my dad finds out.

48:42.436 --> 48:44.922
- Oh, this must be Leann's mom.

48:47.683 --> 48:49.133
- Huh?

48:49.167 --> 48:52.343
- I found an old engagement
announcement in an old article.

48:52.377 --> 48:54.828
Frank Balspaugh IV to be wed to,

48:54.862 --> 48:57.382
can you read that name?

48:57.417 --> 48:59.798
It looks like Sue Cucumber?

49:01.352 --> 49:04.803
Kidding. It looks like
parts of the ink is ruin

49:04.838 --> 49:07.082
'cause they didn't preserve
the article in time.

49:08.083 --> 49:09.083
Are you listening?

49:10.119 --> 49:13.157
- Yeah. What year is that?

49:13.191 --> 49:16.850
- 1999 why?

49:16.884 --> 49:21.406
- I gotta go?

49:21.441 --> 49:22.441
- Okay.

50:30.475 --> 50:33.961
- I sat under an Oak
tree meditating in
the cool of the day

50:33.996 --> 50:36.826
when behold a great
light shown before me.

50:36.861 --> 50:39.001
I heard his voice speak my name.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.623
Afraid I fell to the ground.

50:40.658 --> 50:42.970
He told me to get up and
write everything down.

51:12.793 --> 51:14.485
Jesus Christ.

51:59.357 --> 52:00.357
- Rob?

52:07.676 --> 52:09.850
Rob, you're home?

52:35.807 --> 52:36.807
- Hi David.

52:38.810 --> 52:40.502
- Father Edwards. What
are you doing here?

52:40.536 --> 52:42.331
- I just came over
to check on things.

52:42.366 --> 52:45.196
Sorry, I didn't call, but
I was already in the area.

52:45.231 --> 52:46.231
- Sure. Come in.

52:55.586 --> 52:58.382
It's kind of weird
that you're here.

52:58.416 --> 52:59.416
- How so?

53:00.901 --> 53:04.457
- I find myself asking questions
and in need of guidance.

53:06.769 --> 53:08.357
- What's that?

53:08.392 --> 53:09.945
- I've been asking
the same thing.

53:09.979 --> 53:12.637
It looks like a Bible, but
sure doesn't read like one.

53:18.850 --> 53:22.095
- By the time of renewal with
dawn where my appointed child

53:22.129 --> 53:25.754
will return to the shrine
of sacrifice upon which

53:25.788 --> 53:28.515
this message will be
enshrined to commence

53:28.550 --> 53:30.862
a aroma of offering.

53:32.554 --> 53:34.107
- What's that supposed to mean?

53:35.315 --> 53:36.558
- I don't know.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.664
How are you adjusting
to Mission Point?

53:41.218 --> 53:42.736
- I don't know yet.

53:42.771 --> 53:43.772
Rob's nice.

53:43.806 --> 53:44.806
- And school?

53:46.740 --> 53:47.810
- I met a girl.

53:50.019 --> 53:51.297
- That's great, David.

53:53.575 --> 53:55.404
- Have you heard
how my mom is doing?

53:58.959 --> 54:02.515
- The Lord is doing His
part and her faith seems

54:02.549 --> 54:03.964
to be getting stronger.

54:03.999 --> 54:06.933
- I know, I pray
for her every night.

54:08.728 --> 54:09.763
- That's great David.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.008
She can really use
all the prayers.

54:14.699 --> 54:17.046
Is there anything
else on your mind?

54:20.843 --> 54:23.156
- Nope. I don't think so.

54:24.571 --> 54:26.884
- Well listen, I'm
gonna head out.

54:26.918 --> 54:31.647
Let Rob know I stop by and
if you ever wanna talk,

54:31.682 --> 54:33.097
I'm just a train ride away.

54:53.911 --> 54:54.911
- Hey bra.

54:55.947 --> 54:56.948
- My name's David.

54:58.709 --> 55:01.159
- Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. David.

55:01.194 --> 55:02.299
Look, David.

55:04.162 --> 55:07.373
I'm really sorry about how
I've been treating you.

55:07.407 --> 55:08.407
- Oh yeah?

55:09.340 --> 55:10.824
- Yeah.

55:10.859 --> 55:15.622
You know, I've been a real
jerk lately or at least

55:17.106 --> 55:19.523
that's what my girlfriend
keeps telling me a lot.

55:21.076 --> 55:26.046
Anyway. I was wondering if
you'd come over and help me work

55:26.806 --> 55:28.255
on a float later today.

55:28.290 --> 55:30.016
- Sorry. I'm busy.

55:31.466 --> 55:32.466
- Come on David.

55:33.709 --> 55:35.746
- Seriously. No, thank you.

55:37.851 --> 55:40.440
- All right. Look, David.

55:40.475 --> 55:43.201
I promised my girlfriend
I'd be nice to you today.

55:43.236 --> 55:47.620
So can you do me a favor
and just be all Jesus-like

55:47.654 --> 55:48.654
and forgive me.

55:49.967 --> 55:50.967
- All right.

55:52.935 --> 55:54.351
- Cool. I'm driving.

56:00.564 --> 56:03.429
- Hey. What was that about?

56:03.463 --> 56:06.535
- Your brother invited me
to go make a float with him.

56:06.570 --> 56:07.570
- So you're in?

56:08.606 --> 56:10.608
- Kind of have to.

56:10.643 --> 56:11.713
- Good. When?

56:12.990 --> 56:15.579
- After school. See you.

56:32.734 --> 56:33.769
- Hey David, hop in.

56:56.723 --> 56:58.000
- I just don't get it.

56:58.035 --> 56:59.519
- What's to get?

56:59.554 --> 57:00.876
- I guess I've never seen
a town get behind something

57:00.900 --> 57:02.349
like this before.

57:02.384 --> 57:03.592
- It's tradition.

57:03.627 --> 57:05.180
- Like Christmas.

57:06.871 --> 57:09.909
- I mean all of our dads
are in it and their dads

57:09.943 --> 57:11.945
and their dad's dads.

57:11.980 --> 57:14.361
There's really nothing
to get. Just do it.

57:14.396 --> 57:16.640
So is it like
a religion or a club?

57:17.503 --> 57:18.503
- Kind of both.

57:19.781 --> 57:23.370
- If you're asking, if we
believe in God then yeah. Duh.

57:23.405 --> 57:26.995
- Actually I've been toying
with the idea of atheism,

57:27.029 --> 57:29.687
you know, science
evolution and such.

57:29.722 --> 57:32.552
- But we also know that the
Wheelmakers offer something

57:32.587 --> 57:36.280
that well, going to
church just can't.

57:36.314 --> 57:37.764
- Like, what?

57:37.799 --> 57:40.387
- Look, we got to hurry up
or we're never finished this.

57:41.561 --> 57:44.944
So is this like the Wheelmaker?

57:44.978 --> 57:46.704
- Some of it.
There's a whole book.

57:46.739 --> 57:48.395
You just put in the highlights.

57:51.329 --> 57:53.193
- Who's supreme intelligence?

57:53.228 --> 57:56.231
Is that how the
Wheelmakers refer to God?

57:56.265 --> 57:57.784
- Huh?

57:57.819 --> 57:59.648
Yeah. Who else? Why?

58:01.754 --> 58:05.171
- It says in the Bible you
serve no other God's before me.

58:05.205 --> 58:06.389
And so I'm not sure
what they mean.

58:06.413 --> 58:11.211
- Look. Sorry dude, but
we don't really care.

58:11.246 --> 58:13.179
We just do it 'cause
it's tradition

58:13.213 --> 58:15.768
and our parents
make us and whatnot.

58:15.802 --> 58:19.012
Plus I wanna go to Harvard
and this looks really good

58:19.047 --> 58:20.497
on my college application.

58:20.531 --> 58:23.085
- And where is Leann? She
was supposed to meet us here.

58:26.399 --> 58:28.884
Leann, where are you?

58:28.919 --> 58:31.300
David is here and this plan
won't work without you.

58:32.785 --> 58:34.787
- Leann okay then?
- Yeah.

58:35.753 --> 58:37.444
- Sorry I'm late.

58:37.479 --> 58:39.792
- You basically left us
here to do all the work.

58:39.826 --> 58:41.034
- Excuse me.

58:41.069 --> 58:42.967
- Yeah, it sucks. And
I'm kind of over it.

58:43.002 --> 58:44.866
- I did not come here to fight.

58:46.453 --> 58:48.732
- Is that all right
if I just head out?

58:48.766 --> 58:50.527
- If it wasn't for
David over here,

58:50.561 --> 58:52.632
we wouldn't have even
been this far along.

58:52.667 --> 58:54.116
- Fine. If David is such a help

58:54.151 --> 58:56.636
maybe he can stay and I'll go.

58:56.671 --> 58:59.018
- Oh, that's nice.
Real nice Leann.

58:59.052 --> 59:00.547
- I don't wanna get in the
middle of anything here so.

59:00.571 --> 59:02.090
- Shut up, David.

59:02.124 --> 59:03.609
- I'm just gonna.

59:03.643 --> 59:06.853
- You have no respect.
Where's the sympathy for me?

59:06.888 --> 59:09.787
- We've been here all
day busting our asses

59:09.822 --> 59:12.100
for your father's
enshrinement crap.

59:12.134 --> 59:13.619
- I'm done. Done.

59:13.653 --> 59:16.587
Hey David, wait up.
I'll walk with you.

59:16.622 --> 59:19.038
- That's nice. Real nice Leann.

59:24.319 --> 59:26.804
- Come on this
way. It's shorter.

59:26.839 --> 59:30.394
- Oh, Rob told me to
stay away from the woods.

59:30.428 --> 59:33.639
- Why? We've been playing in
the woods since we were kids.

59:33.673 --> 59:35.572
- Weird things happen out here.

59:35.606 --> 59:37.056
- Oh, you're such a good boy.

59:37.090 --> 59:38.367
Come on. Let's go.

59:39.783 --> 59:42.095
- We should probably just
take the longer route.

59:42.130 --> 59:43.649
It's more scenic.

59:43.683 --> 59:44.891
- Don't be such a loser.

59:49.068 --> 59:52.174
- You have to admit it's a
little creepy here, right?

59:52.209 --> 59:53.659
- Are you scared?

59:53.693 --> 59:58.215
- No, but do you feel
like we're being watched?

59:58.249 --> 1:00:01.459
- No. Do you?
- Yes. Absolutely.

1:00:02.875 --> 1:00:04.369
There's something not right
going on in these woods.

1:00:04.393 --> 1:00:06.016
- It sounds like you
need a little weed

1:00:06.050 --> 1:00:07.673
to take off the edge.

1:00:07.707 --> 1:00:08.707
- No, I'm good.

1:00:12.125 --> 1:00:14.507
- Your loss, it'll take that
anxiety you've been holding

1:00:14.541 --> 1:00:16.613
onto from a level 10 to a zero.

1:00:18.097 --> 1:00:19.374
- I wouldn't say I'm a 10.

1:00:32.663 --> 1:00:34.700
- For real you don't feel
like we're being watched?

1:00:34.734 --> 1:00:35.734
- Nope.

1:00:37.047 --> 1:00:38.047
- What was that?

1:00:39.083 --> 1:00:41.016
What time is it? When
did it get so dark?

1:00:41.051 --> 1:00:43.501
- The sun just went
down. Just chill out.

1:00:43.536 --> 1:00:45.745
- Crap. I'm supposed
to be home for dinner.

1:00:45.780 --> 1:00:46.884
- Hold on. Wait.

1:00:52.614 --> 1:00:53.614
- Who's there?

1:00:55.410 --> 1:00:56.342
Did you hear that?

1:00:56.376 --> 1:00:58.171
- No. It's just us, promise.

1:00:59.379 --> 1:01:01.485
- What is happening?
Aren't you with Jayden?

1:01:01.519 --> 1:01:04.246
- Yeah. So I'm tired of
him being such a dick.

1:01:04.281 --> 1:01:06.352
Maybe I need a
nice guy like you.

1:01:09.458 --> 1:01:13.842
- I can't be here. I have
a girlfriend. I think.

1:01:13.877 --> 1:01:14.877
- You think?

1:01:19.123 --> 1:01:20.849
- I'm impressed. I didn't think

1:01:20.884 --> 1:01:23.231
you could get such good footage.

1:01:23.265 --> 1:01:25.198
- Maybe you have some
more faith in me.

1:01:26.510 --> 1:01:27.753
When are you gonna post it?

1:01:27.787 --> 1:01:29.720
- In the morning before school.

1:01:31.860 --> 1:01:34.656
- Dude, your sister's
gonna be so pissed.

1:01:34.691 --> 1:01:37.555
- Ugh. Yeah. It's
kind of the point.

1:01:37.590 --> 1:01:39.385
She needs to dump that loser.

1:01:39.419 --> 1:01:40.904
- Did you get it?

1:01:40.938 --> 1:01:41.938
- Yep.

1:01:42.940 --> 1:01:45.287
- Maybe don't post it
to the whole school,

1:01:45.322 --> 1:01:47.289
but just snap it to your sister.

1:01:47.324 --> 1:01:48.843
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:01:48.877 --> 1:01:51.673
I didn't say anything about
posting it to the whole school.

1:01:51.708 --> 1:01:53.468
Just DM it to Zoe.

1:01:54.745 --> 1:01:55.745
- Fine.

1:02:00.786 --> 1:02:03.720
- Oh, she looks mad,
Dude, what did you do?

1:02:03.754 --> 1:02:05.480
- Nothing. I did nothing.

1:02:05.514 --> 1:02:07.344
- How could you?

1:02:07.378 --> 1:02:09.139
- I have zero clue what
you're talking about?

1:02:09.173 --> 1:02:11.313
- Really? You, Leann, woods.

1:02:11.348 --> 1:02:12.763
Does any of that ring a bell?

1:02:13.902 --> 1:02:15.352
- How do you know about that?

1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:19.563
- Come on. He's a jerk.

1:02:24.775 --> 1:02:26.570
- I still like you.

1:02:26.604 --> 1:02:30.022
- Thanks. I gotta go
find Zoe and explain.

1:02:30.056 --> 1:02:33.301
- Maybe just let her
cool off for a minute.

1:02:33.335 --> 1:02:38.306
Don't push. Trust me. I
live with two females.

1:02:41.171 --> 1:02:42.620
How about I come
over after school?

1:02:42.655 --> 1:02:44.312
We bang out some tunes.

1:02:44.346 --> 1:02:45.658
Take your mind off things.

1:02:54.115 --> 1:02:56.634
Hey, why you let
them pick on you?

1:02:58.395 --> 1:02:59.879
- Turn to them the other cheek.

1:03:00.777 --> 1:03:01.823
That's what the Bible says in-

1:03:01.847 --> 1:03:04.263
- Matthew chapter five.

1:03:04.297 --> 1:03:05.851
- That's right.

1:03:05.885 --> 1:03:08.163
Wait, but how did you know that?

1:03:08.198 --> 1:03:09.786
Well, I know lots
of stuff like that.

1:03:09.820 --> 1:03:11.960
Mom is super
religious and she used

1:03:11.995 --> 1:03:13.306
to make me teach Sunday school.

1:03:13.341 --> 1:03:15.377
- Didn't see that coming.

1:03:15.412 --> 1:03:17.241
- Oh yeah. Why?

1:03:18.622 --> 1:03:19.622
- Out of character.

1:03:21.176 --> 1:03:22.522
- I love my mom.

1:03:22.557 --> 1:03:25.146
She's the only parent
I've ever known.

1:03:25.180 --> 1:03:28.149
- Me too. Sort of.

1:03:29.736 --> 1:03:32.498
I've been in and out of
foster my whole life.

1:03:32.532 --> 1:03:37.503
But when my mom's good
and she's on her meds,

1:03:40.817 --> 1:03:41.817
it's amazing.

1:03:43.026 --> 1:03:44.890
It's those lows
that totally suck.

1:03:46.581 --> 1:03:47.858
What happened to your dad?

1:03:49.515 --> 1:03:52.104
- Ran out on us right
after my sister was born.

1:03:52.138 --> 1:03:53.450
And haven't seen him since.

1:03:54.589 --> 1:03:58.765
Guess two kids
were too much. You?

1:04:00.181 --> 1:04:01.699
- I don't know.

1:04:03.149 --> 1:04:06.014
I think that might be
what I'm here to find out.

1:04:06.049 --> 1:04:09.604
- Here like Mission
Point here or like here

1:04:09.638 --> 1:04:12.434
in the universe
big picture here?

1:04:13.642 --> 1:04:15.886
- I do think my dad's
from Mission Point, but

1:04:17.854 --> 1:04:20.339
I don't know if he's
still here or not.

1:04:20.373 --> 1:04:22.203
- Ooh, intrigue.

1:04:23.790 --> 1:04:26.414
- I have thoughts,
but it's not clear.

1:04:27.346 --> 1:04:28.623
Oh. Sounds like

1:04:28.657 --> 1:04:29.669
we should start asking questions

1:04:29.693 --> 1:04:32.006
about your long lost poppy.

1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:34.318
- No, the Lord protects me.

1:04:34.353 --> 1:04:36.873
He allowed father Edwards
to find me this place.

1:04:36.907 --> 1:04:38.978
- Mm. I don't know.

1:04:39.013 --> 1:04:40.266
That sounds like it
could take a long time.

1:04:40.290 --> 1:04:42.602
Let's go ask Rob some questions.

1:04:42.637 --> 1:04:43.949
- I know when it's my time.

1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:48.400
- Maybe.

1:05:06.833 --> 1:05:09.733
- Hey, I've been
looking for you.

1:05:09.767 --> 1:05:11.355
- Oh yeah. Why?

1:05:11.390 --> 1:05:13.806
- I want to apologize
for the other night.

1:05:15.428 --> 1:05:18.224
- Why do you care so
much if I forgive you?

1:05:18.259 --> 1:05:20.675
- It's just things got
a little out of hand

1:05:20.709 --> 1:05:23.850
with the fake fight
and I'm sorry.

1:05:25.818 --> 1:05:29.649
- Oh, so Miss Popularity
can't stand the idea

1:05:29.684 --> 1:05:32.514
of someone not liking her.

1:05:32.549 --> 1:05:33.584
Get over it.

1:05:33.619 --> 1:05:34.896
- That's not it. It's just,

1:05:34.931 --> 1:05:36.553
I have a feeling
like we're supposed

1:05:36.587 --> 1:05:37.934
to be friends or something.

1:05:38.831 --> 1:05:40.074
They say, trust your gut.

1:05:43.008 --> 1:05:44.595
Are you researching for paper?

1:05:46.425 --> 1:05:48.945
- No, just reading up on Psalms.

1:05:48.979 --> 1:05:49.773
- Why?

1:05:49.807 --> 1:05:51.016
- Why not?

1:05:51.050 --> 1:05:53.535
- Right. Do you
accept my apology?

1:05:53.570 --> 1:05:56.814
- Look, I can't help you
clear your conscience.

1:05:56.849 --> 1:05:58.816
Okay. You have to
do that on your own.

1:05:58.851 --> 1:06:02.165
- Yeah. I have a feeling
that there are a few things

1:06:02.199 --> 1:06:03.994
that I need to clear up.

1:06:06.997 --> 1:06:07.894
- Like what?

1:06:07.929 --> 1:06:09.310
- Well, when I was a baby,

1:06:09.344 --> 1:06:13.693
my mom took off and I
haven't heard from her since.

1:06:13.728 --> 1:06:16.041
- I'm sorry. That's sad.

1:06:16.075 --> 1:06:19.561
- Pops isn't exactly super
chatty about the subject.

1:06:19.596 --> 1:06:21.598
We don't really talk about it.

1:06:21.632 --> 1:06:24.601
- You seem kind of
casual about it.

1:06:24.635 --> 1:06:27.811
- Not having a mom is the
only truth I've ever known.

1:06:27.845 --> 1:06:29.502
Here's something
that's up your alley.

1:06:29.537 --> 1:06:31.815
I think my house is
possessed by demons.

1:06:33.023 --> 1:06:36.647
- Wait, really? Like
what kind of demons?

1:06:36.682 --> 1:06:39.512
- I don't know. Demon's
the creepy bad kind.

1:06:39.547 --> 1:06:41.480
I've asked my dad to have
Madame Olivia come over

1:06:41.514 --> 1:06:42.895
to sage the house.

1:06:42.929 --> 1:06:43.723
You should come.

1:06:43.758 --> 1:06:45.311
- Cool. I'm in.

1:06:48.452 --> 1:06:50.109
- What's up, dude?

1:06:50.144 --> 1:06:52.077
- I'm coming over later.

1:06:52.111 --> 1:06:53.112
- Sounds about right.

1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:55.425
- See you.

1:06:55.459 --> 1:06:58.014
- Chat to you later, dude.

1:07:28.975 --> 1:07:33.946
- Blessings and grace
fill this sacred space.

1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:37.363
May joy and peace
abide in this place.

1:07:38.882 --> 1:07:40.435
Silence.

1:07:43.231 --> 1:07:47.891
- Please. I must insist
upon absolute quiet.

1:07:48.754 --> 1:07:50.411
- This is not gonna work.

1:07:55.761 --> 1:07:57.694
You're wasting your time.

1:07:57.728 --> 1:07:59.420
She's doing more harm than good.

1:07:59.454 --> 1:08:01.146
- I'm terribly sorry mam.

1:08:01.180 --> 1:08:03.769
Young man, leave this house now.

1:08:03.803 --> 1:08:05.598
- No, it's all right.
It's all right.

1:08:07.600 --> 1:08:09.119
Explain yourself.

1:08:09.154 --> 1:08:11.328
- Only God can heal this place.

1:08:11.363 --> 1:08:14.435
Only through His authority
will the spirits leave.

1:08:16.092 --> 1:08:18.991
- Fine then. Show us
how it's done then.

1:08:29.243 --> 1:08:33.799
- Almighty, help
me heal this place.

1:08:36.181 --> 1:08:38.459
Show these people
who's really in charge.

1:08:38.493 --> 1:08:40.116
- Amen.

1:08:40.150 --> 1:08:41.634
- In Your name. Amen.

1:08:47.744 --> 1:08:49.125
Did you hear me, God?

1:08:50.022 --> 1:08:51.472
Rid the house of evil.

1:08:55.061 --> 1:08:57.581
Show these people
your true power.

1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:01.930
In Your name, Jesus.

1:09:05.900 --> 1:09:07.143
- Now may we continue?

1:09:16.290 --> 1:09:17.705
- Hey, wait up.

1:09:27.128 --> 1:09:28.543
That was embarrassing.

1:09:28.578 --> 1:09:32.513
- Yeah, Madame Olivia should
be ashamed of herself.

1:09:32.547 --> 1:09:34.273
- No dude. I meant for you.

1:09:35.964 --> 1:09:39.278
I gotta find
Olguita. Later dude.

1:09:44.214 --> 1:09:48.908
- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, so I'm
actually glad you stopped by.

1:09:50.393 --> 1:09:52.774
Something's not right.

1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:56.053
- Between you and David?

1:09:57.572 --> 1:09:58.815
- Oh no, no, no.

1:09:58.849 --> 1:10:00.748
David's actually,
he's a great kid.

1:10:00.782 --> 1:10:02.208
I've seen where he's
been going through

1:10:02.232 --> 1:10:06.305
my stuff, but nothing worse
than what I

1:10:06.340 --> 1:10:07.340
through Father.

1:10:09.860 --> 1:10:11.931
- Rob, you were a challenge,

1:10:12.898 --> 1:10:16.281
but look at you now, a sheriff.

1:10:16.315 --> 1:10:21.286
- Yeah. Right? I mean
genuinely my dream job,

1:10:22.908 --> 1:10:25.324
which is why I'm
concerned about this town

1:10:25.359 --> 1:10:30.122
because I'm often
here, it is spooky.

1:10:31.157 --> 1:10:32.158
- Spooky?

1:10:32.193 --> 1:10:35.852
- Yes. Yes.

1:10:35.886 --> 1:10:37.612
It's it's these Wheelmakers.

1:10:37.647 --> 1:10:39.338
I'm telling you man,

1:10:39.373 --> 1:10:43.100
look like I'm talking
initiation ceremonies,

1:10:43.135 --> 1:10:46.656
midnight meetings,
blood oaths. Okay.

1:10:46.690 --> 1:10:48.554
And it's creeping me out.

1:10:48.589 --> 1:10:49.589
This is not.

1:10:53.766 --> 1:10:57.322
Hey you all right?

1:10:59.324 --> 1:11:00.324
- Fine.

1:11:02.706 --> 1:11:03.776
Father Edwards.

1:11:05.226 --> 1:11:09.506
- Just here to see how
both of you're adjusting.

1:11:09.541 --> 1:11:11.474
How you making out
these days, David?

1:11:11.508 --> 1:11:14.580
- Well, I just came
from a house saging.

1:11:14.615 --> 1:11:15.926
- Like, excuse me?

1:11:18.066 --> 1:11:19.066
Where?

1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.693
- At the mayor's
house with Gomez.

1:11:23.727 --> 1:11:26.903
- It looked like something
was wrong. So what happened?

1:11:26.937 --> 1:11:28.560
- It didn't work.

1:11:28.594 --> 1:11:30.009
- What didn't work?

1:11:30.044 --> 1:11:31.356
The house saging?

1:11:32.667 --> 1:11:33.806
I'm not surprised.

1:11:33.841 --> 1:11:36.188
- No. God abandoned me.

1:11:38.155 --> 1:11:39.985
I asked Him to rid
the house of evil

1:11:40.019 --> 1:11:43.333
and He made me look like a fool.

1:11:43.368 --> 1:11:44.714
- Let me ask you something.

1:11:46.198 --> 1:11:48.890
What was your motive when you
were in that house praying

1:11:48.925 --> 1:11:50.685
in front of all of those people?

1:11:52.169 --> 1:11:56.588
Was it to put on some type
of magic show or was it truly

1:11:58.037 --> 1:12:02.318
and sincerely to set that
house and everyone inside free?

1:12:05.424 --> 1:12:07.599
- To set everyone free.

1:12:07.633 --> 1:12:10.118
- Do you remember when
Jesus was on the cross?

1:12:10.153 --> 1:12:13.018
Do you? And everybody told
Him to come down off of it

1:12:13.052 --> 1:12:14.778
and then they would believe.

1:12:16.262 --> 1:12:18.782
He didn't put on a show
for His daughters did He?

1:12:18.817 --> 1:12:21.578
So why are you so sure He
wasn't working on your behalf?

1:12:23.097 --> 1:12:27.481
Behind the scenes at the exact
moment that you were praying.

1:12:29.068 --> 1:12:30.068
Think about it.

1:12:31.416 --> 1:12:35.558
See David. I don't know
everything that's in your heart,

1:12:35.592 --> 1:12:39.320
but I can only suggest to
you that you do everything

1:12:39.355 --> 1:12:40.839
out of love.

1:12:40.873 --> 1:12:45.326
Nothing more and nothing less.

1:12:45.361 --> 1:12:48.122
- Amen. Amen.

1:12:51.159 --> 1:12:54.784
- Hey listen. I
got a little gift

1:12:54.818 --> 1:12:56.130
for your birthday tomorrow.

1:13:08.142 --> 1:13:09.142
- Thank you.

1:13:09.902 --> 1:13:10.972
- You're welcome son.

1:13:23.157 --> 1:13:27.299
- Hello folks. Welcome to
another year of enshrinement.

1:13:30.336 --> 1:13:33.995
It was this day,
many, many years ago

1:13:34.030 --> 1:13:36.342
when the very first Wheelmaker,

1:13:36.377 --> 1:13:40.416
my great grandfather,
Frank P. Balspaugh I,

1:13:40.450 --> 1:13:45.421
created the Wheelmakers
right here in Mission Point.

1:13:50.115 --> 1:13:51.979
Everybody, enjoy the festivity.

1:13:56.293 --> 1:13:57.087
- And step.

1:13:57.122 --> 1:13:58.054
- What?

1:13:58.088 --> 1:13:59.952
- Can we do something different?

1:13:59.987 --> 1:14:01.195
It's Leann's birthday.

1:14:01.229 --> 1:14:02.990
- I'm fine with
the woods. Come on.

1:14:10.825 --> 1:14:11.999
- That's crazy.

1:14:15.451 --> 1:14:17.453
- Damn, we're getting low beer.

1:14:17.487 --> 1:14:19.006
- On it. Plus I gotta pee.

1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:20.248
- Want me to come with?

1:14:20.283 --> 1:14:22.181
- Nah, it's okay.
I'll be back in a few.

1:14:22.216 --> 1:14:23.216
- Thanks babe.

1:14:36.955 --> 1:14:41.925
- Heavenly Father, save the
Wheelmakers and this whole town.

1:14:45.619 --> 1:14:47.448
To any evil spirits,

1:14:48.345 --> 1:14:51.487
in Jesus' name you must go.

1:15:29.525 --> 1:15:31.009
- Mommy, what's up?

1:15:31.043 --> 1:15:32.562
Have you seen your sister?

1:15:32.597 --> 1:15:35.151
- She's probably playing
in the church again.

1:15:35.185 --> 1:15:37.498
She knows she's not
supposed to be in there.

1:15:39.258 --> 1:15:44.229
Let's go find her. Come on.

1:16:14.604 --> 1:16:19.575
- David it's you,
the time has arrived.

1:16:20.610 --> 1:16:23.026
May our obedience be rewarded?

1:16:23.924 --> 1:16:24.925
Restrain him.

1:16:31.483 --> 1:16:34.348
- Hey, sorry about the video.

1:16:34.382 --> 1:16:35.591
- Yeah, right.

1:16:35.625 --> 1:16:37.800
I just need you to know
that David had nothing

1:16:37.834 --> 1:16:38.834
to do with it.

1:16:39.629 --> 1:16:40.423
You should go find him.

1:16:40.457 --> 1:16:41.804
- Saw him by the lodge.

1:16:41.838 --> 1:16:43.115
- What? Let's go.

1:16:45.773 --> 1:16:46.947
- Let go of me.

1:16:46.981 --> 1:16:48.120
- It is written.

1:16:48.155 --> 1:16:49.639
- What are you doing?

1:16:49.674 --> 1:16:54.230
- On this Eve of Enshrinement,
my heir will be revealed.

1:16:56.853 --> 1:17:01.755
Benevolent master except
this holy sacrifice once

1:17:02.963 --> 1:17:03.998
and for all.

1:17:06.345 --> 1:17:09.141
- Oh, hell no. This was
not in the brochure.

1:17:12.662 --> 1:17:14.526
- Hey, David's in
there. Is he okay?

1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:15.700
- Zoe, you can't go in.

1:17:15.734 --> 1:17:16.734
- No, Dad.

1:17:18.116 --> 1:17:19.231
- You can't go in
there. You can't.

1:17:19.255 --> 1:17:20.946
- Dad, no.

1:17:20.981 --> 1:17:21.981
- It's real.

1:17:24.605 --> 1:17:27.401
- That puny dagger is
nothing compared to the sword

1:17:27.435 --> 1:17:28.333
of the Spirit.

1:17:28.367 --> 1:17:30.680
- Dad, what are you doing?

1:17:37.238 --> 1:17:38.238
- Frankie?

1:17:42.209 --> 1:17:43.451
- Daddy, stop this.

1:17:43.486 --> 1:17:45.281
- Oh, shut up you little brat.

1:17:45.315 --> 1:17:48.594
Do you think your father
ever really loved you?

1:17:48.629 --> 1:17:49.629
- Sister.

1:17:54.842 --> 1:17:57.673
- David.

1:17:59.122 --> 1:18:02.298
- You think you can destroy
me, don't you David?

1:18:02.332 --> 1:18:07.303
Demon, reveal your name.

1:18:13.758 --> 1:18:18.694
- Burn in hell. Who were you
expecting? Old Frankie boy?

1:18:33.812 --> 1:18:35.203
- In the name of
the Lord, your reign

1:18:35.227 --> 1:18:37.713
over this town ends now.

1:18:45.651 --> 1:18:46.651
- Stop it.

1:18:54.626 --> 1:18:56.559
Get away from there.

1:18:56.593 --> 1:18:57.594
- Whoa dude.

1:19:03.669 --> 1:19:08.571
- Dad, stop this.

1:19:10.262 --> 1:19:14.473
Are you the master?

1:19:15.681 --> 1:19:18.305
Creation
you will bow down to me.

1:19:18.339 --> 1:19:21.584
- No, I will not bow down.

1:19:23.689 --> 1:19:26.969
- Frank, can't you see
the Wheelmakers are over?

1:19:28.556 --> 1:19:29.661
God is the way.

1:19:31.352 --> 1:19:35.287
Please give David the strength.

1:19:35.322 --> 1:19:36.979
In the name of John.

1:19:40.465 --> 1:19:44.641
- And the Lord say, I
cancel your authority

1:19:44.676 --> 1:19:47.230
and break the curse.

1:19:51.683 --> 1:19:53.581
- Oh mighty Lord Jesus.

1:19:56.412 --> 1:19:57.827
- Dad, come back.

1:20:02.314 --> 1:20:03.902
We only wanna help.

1:20:07.388 --> 1:20:09.943
- So many things can happen
using the power of faith

1:20:09.977 --> 1:20:13.567
like exorcizing a demon
on a guy that turns out

1:20:13.601 --> 1:20:18.572
to be your real dad or maybe
ridding a town from evil.

1:20:19.745 --> 1:20:22.231
But through it all,
I found my family

1:20:22.265 --> 1:20:25.821
and ultimately experienced
the strength of true love.

1:20:27.719 --> 1:20:29.169
- I'm happy you stuck around.

1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:31.723
- Yeah. Me too.

1:20:32.931 --> 1:20:34.830
And Rob's been really
nice letting me stay.

1:20:34.864 --> 1:20:37.625
Well, I learned about you
guys and where I came from.

1:20:38.799 --> 1:20:40.352
- So that sounds
like you're leaving.

1:20:41.664 --> 1:20:42.664
- I'm not leaving.

1:20:45.185 --> 1:20:49.948
My mom is doing better and
I wanna go check on her.

1:20:49.983 --> 1:20:51.225
- I get that.

1:20:51.260 --> 1:20:52.824
But now that our town
has a new tradition,

1:20:52.848 --> 1:20:56.852
Mission Point Independence day
which falls on your birthday.

1:20:56.886 --> 1:20:58.750
Are you coming back for it?

1:20:58.784 --> 1:20:59.784
- Yeah.

1:21:00.856 --> 1:21:02.547
It's not like I'm far.

1:21:02.581 --> 1:21:04.514
And I'll have you
guys to come back to.

1:21:06.171 --> 1:21:07.655
- Oh, there we go.

1:21:09.312 --> 1:21:11.211
Oh man. I am starving.

1:21:11.245 --> 1:21:12.488
- I know me too.

1:21:13.558 --> 1:21:15.008
- What a beautiful day, huh?

1:21:16.561 --> 1:21:18.701
- I haven't seen
you in like forever.

1:21:18.735 --> 1:21:20.082
- I know.

1:21:29.746 --> 1:21:32.439
- Oh and unfortunately
the battle of good

1:21:32.473 --> 1:21:34.061
versus evil carries on.
