04:45.660 --> 04:47.696
- YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE.

04:47.730 --> 04:51.552

04:57.600 --> 04:59.636
YOU LIED TO US.

04:59.670 --> 05:01.945

06:07.090 --> 06:08.534
HEY, SIR, HOW DO YOU FEEL

06:08.570 --> 06:09.639

06:10.880 --> 06:11.869
YOU KNOW,,
THAT IT'S WRAPPING PAPER.

06:11.920 --> 06:12.944
- I'M REALLY BAD AT THIS.

06:12.990 --> 06:13.775
- YOU'RE NOT REALLY BAD

06:13.820 --> 06:15.845

HAVE YOU WRAPPED YOUR PRESENTS

06:22.480 --> 06:24.516
NO? OKAY,
WELL, I HAVE A DREAM

06:24.550 --> 06:26.541
THAT THIS WOULD MAKE THEM
LOOK SUPER SPECIAL.

06:26.590 --> 06:28.797
- OKAY, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

06:28.830 --> 06:31.458

- SO IT'S CHRISTMAS PAPER.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.903
- YEAH.

06:36.940 --> 06:38.043
- IT SEEMS WEIRD,

06:38.080 --> 06:40.731
'CAUSE YOU SAY TO YOURSELF,
"THE HOLIDAYS ARE OVER."

06:40.770 --> 06:42.465
- IT'S NOT THAT.
I'M BUDDHIST.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.809
- OH.
- I DON'T CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS.

06:44.850 --> 06:47.011
- OH...

06:47.060 --> 06:48.914
- IF YOU HAD ANY VISAKAH PUJA,
I COULD HELP YOU OUT.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.508
SORRY. GOOD LUCK.
- THANKS.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.189
- THEY DON'T MAKE
VISAKAH PUJA PAPER.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.229
- [sighs]

06:54.270 --> 06:55.999
I WISH WE COULD JUST DO
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES.

06:56.030 --> 06:57.133
- WHY?
WHAT DID EVERYONE ELSE DO?

06:57.170 --> 07:00.617
- WELL...NO ONE ELSE SELLS
ANY OF THIS.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.480
THEY JUST HAVE THEIR PARENTS
BUY IT ALL.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.897
- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

07:04.940 --> 07:06.692
- THEY DO. I PROMISE.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.836
- WELL, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

07:09.870 --> 07:12.976
EVEN IF I HAD $500,
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

07:13.010 --> 07:13.977
THAT'S CHEATING.

07:14.010 --> 07:16.524
- YEAH. I GUESS.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.913
- EXCUSE ME, SIR,
DO YOU WANT TO--

07:18.950 --> 07:21.259
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY
SOME PA--

07:21.300 --> 07:22.676
- WELL, HE JUST DIDN'T
LOOK FRIENDLY.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.884
- IT MAKES YOU LOVE
A LIFE OF MISERY

07:25.920 --> 07:29.572
- THE KIDS, THEY LOVE
THE GARLIC MASHED POTATOES.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.589
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, TORREY.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.544
- I'M SO SORRY.

07:35.590 --> 07:37.478
- THEY TOLD YOU NOT
TO SEE ME, DIDN'T THEY?

07:37.520 --> 07:39.579
- THEY'RE CRAZY, ALEX.
TH EY'RE--

07:39.630 --> 07:40.938
THEY LIKE YOU AS A PERSON.

07:40.970 --> 07:42.722
THEY FREAKED OUT BECAUSE,

07:42.770 --> 07:44.863
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT IN SCHOOL,

07:44.910 --> 07:47.219
AND YOU LIVE ON YOUR OWN AND--
- BLACK, RIGHT?

07:47.250 --> 07:50.117
- NO. NO, THEY'RE NOT RACIST.

07:50.150 --> 07:52.493
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO DEFEND THEM OR ANYTHING,

07:52.540 --> 07:53.609
BUT THEY'RE NOT RACIST.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.949
THEY FREAKED OUT BECAUSE
YOU'RE IN AA.

07:55.990 --> 07:57.605
- THEY BARELY EVEN KNOW ME,
HADDIE.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.949
- I KNOW. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'VE BEEN TELLING THEM.

07:59.990 --> 08:01.196
I'VE TOLD THEM THAT
100 TIMES.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.949
- YOU LIED TO ME.
AND YOU LIED TO THEM.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.821
AND WHEN YOU DID THAT,
YOU MADE ME PART OF YOUR LIE.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.509
YOU'VE BEEN LYING SO MUCH,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH LIE

08:08.550 --> 08:09.687
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
RIGHT NOW.

08:09.730 --> 08:11.891
- I WAS GONNA TELL YOU.
- WHEN WERE YOU GONNA TELL ME?

08:11.930 --> 08:14.967

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.618
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.

09:18.660 --> 09:21.174
I WASN'T TRYING

09:21.210 --> 09:25.169
IT'S JUST LIKE...
I DON'T KNOW!

09:25.210 --> 09:26.654
I HATE MY PARENTS!

09:26.700 --> 09:30.659

ANYTHING ABOUT ALEX.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.179
YOU KNOW?
ALL THEY KNOW ABOUT HIM

09:32.220 --> 09:34.734

09:34.780 --> 09:36.702
AND HE'S OLDER.

09:36.740 --> 09:40.153

BUT, SWEETIE,

09:41.820 --> 09:43.640
I CAN'T GET BETWEEN YOU

09:43.680 --> 09:46.649
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE DOING
ONLY WHAT THEY THINK

09:46.680 --> 09:48.853
IS BEST FOR YOU,
YOU KNOW?

09:48.890 --> 09:50.061
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THEN?

09:50.100 --> 09:53.035
- I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST
LET EVERYTHING SIMMER DOWN.

09:53.070 --> 09:56.107
JUST, YOU KNOW--
JUST LET EVERYTHING QUIET DOWN.

09:56.140 --> 09:57.619

10:42.050 --> 10:44.280
FOR ALVIN AILEY?
I HAD LOTS OF BUTTERFLIES THEN.

10:44.330 --> 10:45.183
- REMEMBER, SHE TOOK
ALL THOSE DEEP BREATHS,

10:45.230 --> 10:47.676
AND WAS, LIKE,
SHAKING HER MUSCLES OUT,

10:47.710 --> 10:48.677
LIKE...
[panﬁng]

10:48.710 --> 10:49.677

I DO IT.

10:49.710 --> 10:51.120
- YEAH, YOU LOOK
JUST LIKE THIS.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.843
- [laughs]
- DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

10:52.890 --> 10:55.120
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE THIS.
THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

10:55.170 --> 10:57.058
- SO WHAT'S GOING ON,
JABBAR?

10:57.100 --> 10:58.260
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO
YOUR PART ANYMORE?

10:58.310 --> 11:00.232
- NO, BUT DADDY
WANTS ME TO.

11:00.280 --> 11:04.444
- I SAID THAT I WOULD LIKE HIM
TO TRY IT AGAIN, YOU KNOW.

11:04.490 --> 11:07.345
- LOOK,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT

11:07.390 --> 11:09.005
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.
IT'S OKAY.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.246
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

11:10.290 --> 11:11.143
- GOOD.

11:11.180 --> 11:15.423
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
JUST LIKE THAT?

11:15.460 --> 11:17.143
- WHAT?
IT'S A KINDERGARTEN PLAY.

11:17.190 --> 11:18.703
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

11:18.740 --> 11:21.186
- YEAH, IT'S A BIG DEAL
IF OUR KID BECOMES A QUITI'ER.

11:21.230 --> 11:23.118
- OUR KID IS NOT
A QUI'ITER, OKAY?

11:23.160 --> 11:24.957
I DON'T WANT
TO TRAUMATIZE HIM.

11:24.990 --> 11:26.366
JUST LET HIM HAVE FUN.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.163
- OKAY, HE WASHAVING FUN,

11:28.200 --> 11:29.883
AND THEN HE HAD
ONE LITI'LE HICCUP

11:29.930 --> 11:31.818
DURING A DRESS REHEARSAL,

11:31.860 --> 11:33.168
AND NOW WE'RE SAYING
THROW IN THE TOWEL.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.828
- YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
PERFORMING IS TO ME, OKAY?

11:35.860 --> 11:38.340
BUT IF HE CHOKES OUT THERE,
IT'LL KILL ME.

11:38.380 --> 11:43.340
HE DOESN'T NEED THE PRESSURE.
HE'S ONLY SIX YEARS OLD.

11:43.390 --> 11:45.312
LOOK, JUST RELAX, BABY.

11:45.350 --> 11:47.284
RELAX. OKAY?

11:47.320 --> 11:50.380
SYDNEY'S GONNA BE GREAT,
JABBAR'S GONNA HAVE FUN,

11:50.430 --> 11:56.289
AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE
A VERY, VERY, BIG HIT.

11:56.330 --> 11:59.197
IT'S ALL GONNA BE FINE.

11:59.230 --> 12:02.814
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.129
- HADDIE.

12:07.170 --> 12:08.205
YOUR MOTHER AND I WOULD LIKE

12:08.240 --> 12:11.164
- OKAY.

12:11.210 --> 12:13.269

12:13.310 --> 12:17.178

YOUR FIRST FOUR CLASSES TODAY?

12:17.210 --> 12:18.381

12:18.420 --> 12:19.762
- YEAH. YOU CAN READ IT
IF YOU WANT.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.382
- NO, I'M FINE. THANKS.

12:22.430 --> 12:24.978

12:25.020 --> 12:27.079

12:27.120 --> 12:28.496
- OKAY. I WANT TO
TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.110
- WE'RE LISTENING.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.778
- GREAT. UM, I WAS
AT THE FOOD BANK, SEEING ALEX.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.288
- UNBELIEVABLE.
- HE HATES ME BECAUSE

12:36.340 --> 12:38.194
YOU GUYS TOLD ME THAT I COULDN'T
SEE HIM, AND SO I HAD TO LIE.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.959
- WHAT PART OF BEING GROUNDED
DIDN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.331
- STOP TREATING ME
LIKE A BABY!

12:42.380 --> 12:43.586
- THEN DON'T BEHAVE
LIKE ONE.

12:43.620 --> 12:45.303
- YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE.
I'M NOT GOING TO.

12:45.350 --> 12:46.339
AND I'M GONNA DO
WHATEVER I WANT.

12:46.380 --> 12:49.315
I GET TO MAKE DECISIONS,
AND I'M GONNA SEE ALEX,

12:49.350 --> 12:51.272
AND YOU DON'T GET TO SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT IT!

12:51.320 --> 12:52.480
- REALLY?
- THAT'S RIGHT, GO TO YOUR ROOM.

12:52.530 --> 12:55.101
AND I WANT THAT CELL PHONE.
- DO YOU WANT MY SOUL TOO?

12:55.150 --> 12:57.004
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE BEING
REAL SMART RIGHT NOW.

12:57.050 --> 12:59.189
- HADDIE, I WANT--
- I HATE YOU!

13:04.880 --> 13:06.609
- KRISTINA, HOLD THE DOOR.
- HONEY, I'M HOLDING IT.

13:06.640 --> 13:07.880
I'M NOT HANDY BOB HERE.
- KRISTINA, JUST TAKE THIS.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.989
JUST TAKE THAT, OKAY?

13:09.020 --> 13:11.159
- WATCH THE POINT, HONEY.
- I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.431
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:14.480 --> 13:16.573
- WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
WE'RE DOING?

13:16.620 --> 13:17.780
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

13:17.830 --> 13:19.889
WHEN YOU REGAIN OUR TRUST,
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DOOR BACK.

13:19.930 --> 13:22.342
- ABSOLUTELY.
- I DON'T--

13:22.380 --> 13:23.859
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED

13:23.900 --> 13:26.869

13:26.900 --> 13:29.243

13:29.290 --> 13:31.246
THIS IS ABSURDBEHAVIOR.

13:31.290 --> 13:32.837

13:32.880 --> 13:34.905
WHAT'S CRAZY IS YOU
LYING TO YOUR PARENTS

13:34.950 --> 13:36.429
AND SNEAKING AROUND
BEHIND OUR BACK.

13:36.470 --> 13:38.847
SO NO LONGER ARE YOU
JUST GROUNDED...

13:38.880 --> 13:41.292
- YOU'RE SO GROUNDED.
NO SCREENS, NOTHING.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.150
- NO CELL PHONE, NO TV.
- WHAT?

13:43.200 --> 13:45.839
- NO LAPTOP--YOU'VE GIVEN UP
YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY.

13:45.890 --> 13:47.858
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO MY HOMEWORK?

13:47.890 --> 13:50.267
- THERE IS A DESKTOP DOWNSTAIRS
YOU CAN DO IT ON.

13:50.310 --> 13:51.447
- YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
- ABSOLUTELY.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.856
- LISTEN TO YOURSELVES!

13:52.900 --> 13:54.891

13:56.420 --> 13:58.479
AND I DON'T GET TO HAVE A DOOR?
I DON'T GET IT.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.964
- THIS DOES NOT HAVE
TO DO WITH THAT.

14:00.010 --> 14:01.454
THIS HAS TO DO WITH TRUST.

14:01.490 --> 14:03.526
- WHAT?
- EXACTLY.

14:03.560 --> 14:07.564
- YOU HAVE NO LEGITIMATE REASONS
FOR ANYTHING!

14:15.710 --> 14:19.191
- OH, HONEY, DON'T DRAG IT.
NO, IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK NICE.

14:19.230 --> 14:20.674

16:33.160 --> 16:35.082
YOUR MOM MADE THAT FOR SYDNEY.
- WHAT?

16:35.130 --> 16:39.669
- WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND

16:39.720 --> 16:41.506
- LET'S SPREAD THIS GOLD AROUND!

16:41.550 --> 16:44.132
- ISN'T THAT SYDNEY?
- YEP.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.037
- I THOUGHT JABBAR WAS PLAYING
THE GOLD MINER.

16:47.070 --> 16:48.753
- YEAH, HE WAS, BUT HE
CHANGED HIS MIND, SO...

16:48.800 --> 16:51.109
SHE'S DOING A GREAT JOB,
THOUGH, ISN'T SHE?

16:51.140 --> 16:54.689
- YEAH.
I'LL BE BACK.

16:54.730 --> 16:57.176
HEY, SON, WHAT'S UP?

16:57.220 --> 16:59.074
HEY, HOW COME JABBAR IS
IN THE CHORUS?

16:59.120 --> 17:01.429
- YOU KNOW, I'M A LITTLE BUSY
RIGHT NOW, DAD.

17:01.460 --> 17:02.734
- HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
THE GOLD MINER.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.533
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
- YOU KNOW--

17:05.570 --> 17:07.083
HEY, CAN WE TAKE A BREAK?

17:07.120 --> 17:11.193
- MY BAD. SORRY, JOEL.
- ONLY FOR YOU, ZEEK.

17:11.230 --> 17:14.779
- HE DIDN'T KNOW HIS LINES?
- HE KNOWS HIS LINES, OKAY.

17:14.820 --> 17:15.855
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT.

17:15.890 --> 17:18.131
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT?

17:18.170 --> 17:20.400
HE CAN'T QUIT.
I MEAN, HE'S A BRAVERMAN.

17:20.450 --> 17:21.826
BRAVERMAN DON'T QUIT.

17:21.860 --> 17:23.657
- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TELL THAT TO JASMINE.

17:23.690 --> 17:25.578
- THIS IS JASMINE'S IDEA?

17:25.630 --> 17:27.621
WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE KNOW?
I MEAN, COME ON.

17:27.660 --> 17:29.173
LET ME--
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

17:29.220 --> 17:30.596
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK
TO HIM

17:30.630 --> 17:31.733
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO DO IT,

17:31.770 --> 17:33.180
AND SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO PUSH HIM.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.289
SO THERE'S NOTHING
FOR YOU TO SAY.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.561
- WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT IT?

17:36.600 --> 17:38.158
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.327
SHE'S THE MOM.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.157
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IT DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER

17:41.190 --> 17:42.634
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT?

17:42.680 --> 17:44.739
HE'S YOUR SON, CROSBY--YOU GO'I'I'A
HAVE A SAY IN THIS THING.

17:44.780 --> 17:47.123
YOU'RE SETTING
A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT HERE.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.469
WHO WEARS THE PANTS
IN THE FAMILY?

17:49.510 --> 17:51.091
- WHAT YEAR DO YOU THINK
THIS IS, THE '505?

17:51.130 --> 17:53.132
THERE'S NO ONE WEARING THE PANTS
OR NOT WEARING THE PANTS.

17:53.170 --> 17:54.649
YOU KNOW?
IT'S A PARTNERSHIP.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.377
- GOD, THAT SOUNDS DREADFUL.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.107
- HEY, KRIS.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.412
- OH, MY GOSH, HI.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.519
HOW ARE YOU?
- NICE SURPRISE.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.142
- YEAH, I JUST--
I THOUGHT I'D POP IN.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.873
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT HADDIE.

18:11.910 --> 18:13.878
YOU KNOW THIS BOY ALEX,
RIGHT?

18:13.920 --> 18:15.182
HE WORKS AT THE FOOD BANK.

18:15.230 --> 18:17.118
- YEAH, I KNOW HIM REALLY WELL.
- OKAY.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.390
- YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN WORKING
AT THE CENTER FOR A LONG TIME.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.408
I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE
HE WAS ABOUT NINE.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.782
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW?

18:22.820 --> 18:24.162
HE'S REALLY A GOOD KID.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.260
- HE'S, I'M SURE, GREAT,

18:27.310 --> 18:29.756
BUT HE'S NOT REALLY A KID.
HE'S 19.

18:29.790 --> 18:31.473
- WELL...OKAY.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.169
- ANYWAY, THAT'S THE TROUBLE
WE'RE HAVING.

18:33.210 --> 18:36.384
SHE--SHE THINKS THAT
SHE'S IN LOVE WITH HIM,

18:36.420 --> 18:39.218
AND SHE WANTS TO DATE HIM.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.138
AND ADAM AND I TOLD HER THAT
IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE.

18:41.180 --> 18:42.624
- WELL, SHE TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT IT.

18:42.670 --> 18:45.252
- WHO?
- HADDIE. YESTERDAY.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.905
- YOU SAW HER YESTERDAY?
- WHEN I DROVE HER TO SCHOOL.

18:46.950 --> 18:49.225
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?
- SHE DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

18:49.260 --> 18:52.388
- OH, GEE, I JUST ASSUMED
THAT SHE DID.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.465
- NO, SHE DIDN'T.
- IT WAS JUST--

18:54.510 --> 18:57.195
SHE WAS REALLY--
SHE WAS REALLY UPSET.

18:57.230 --> 18:59.812
THERE WAS A LOT OF DRAMA,
A LOT OF TEARS

18:59.860 --> 19:00.997
ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL.

19:01.030 --> 19:05.239
AND, YOU KNOW, TYPICAL,
USUAL STUFF FOR GIRLS THIS AGE.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.680
BUT I TRIED TO WORK THROUGH IT
WITH HER.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.198
- THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.969
SHE FEELS REALLY COMFORTABLE
CONFIDING IN YOU,

19:13.010 --> 19:14.318
MORE THAN HER OWN MOTHER.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.691
- OH, WELL...

19:15.740 --> 19:16.729
- I'M SORRY, I JUST--
I CAN'T--

19:16.770 --> 19:18.180
- KRISSY, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES

19:18.220 --> 19:20.188
YOUNG GIRLS FEEL
MORE COMFORTABLE

19:20.220 --> 19:21.630
TALKING TO SOMEONE
WHO'S NOT THEIR MOTHER.

19:21.670 --> 19:24.184
AND, OF COURSE, WHEN YOU TELL
A TEENAGE GIRL

19:24.230 --> 19:26.778
THAT SHE CAN'T HAVE SOMETHING,
SHE'S GONNA WANT IT EVEN MORE.

19:26.820 --> 19:27.980
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT.

19:28.020 --> 19:29.601
- RIGHT.

19:29.650 --> 19:31.743
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,
BASICALLY,

19:31.790 --> 19:32.950
THAT ADAM AND I ARE MAKING
A MISTAKE

19:32.990 --> 19:35.231
BY NOT LETTING HER DATE
A 19-YEAR-OLD

19:35.270 --> 19:36.953
RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC
THAT LIVES ALONE--

19:37.000 --> 19:38.968
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S EXACT LY--
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.479
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

19:40.520 --> 19:41.964
I'M SO STUPID THAT
I EVEN CAME OVER HERE.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.649
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAY--
KRIS...

19:43.690 --> 19:45.203
- YOU COULD HAVE CALLED,
CAMILLE.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.480
- KRIS, COME ON.

19:47.530 --> 19:49.350
KRISSY...
[car door shuts]

19:49.390 --> 19:51.665
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

19:51.700 --> 19:54.282
- I'M JUST FINISHING UP HERE
AT WORK, ALL RIGHT?

19:54.330 --> 19:58.983
ALMOST DONE, OKAY?
[knock on door]

19:59.020 --> 20:02.672
I TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL MEET YOU THERE. OKAY?

20:05.920 --> 20:07.569
ALEX.
- MR. BRAVERMAN.

20:07.620 --> 20:08.814
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

20:08.860 --> 20:11.237
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
POP UP ON YOU LIKE THIS,

20:11.270 --> 20:13.022
BUT DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE
TO TALK?

20:13.070 --> 20:16.346
- SURE. COME ON IN.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.413
HAVE A SEAT.
- IT'S A NICE PLACE.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.792
- THANK YOU.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.286
- YOU'RE, LIKE, THE BOSS...
RIGHT?

20:26.320 --> 20:31.348
- YEAH, YEAH,
I'M, LIKE, THE BOSS.

20:33.990 --> 20:35.059
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
AND YOUR WIFE

20:35.090 --> 20:36.011
TOLD HADDIE
SHE COULDN'T SEE ME.

20:36.060 --> 20:39.336
IF I HAD KNOWN,
I WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN HER.

20:39.370 --> 20:42.612
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

20:42.650 --> 20:44.641
AND MY WIFE WILL
APPRECIATE THAT.

20:44.690 --> 20:47.329
- 'CAUSE I WORK REALLY HARD
TO BE 100% HONEST WITH MY LIFE,

20:47.380 --> 20:48.927
ESPECIALLY WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

20:48.970 --> 20:51.347
TO BE HONEST TO MYSELF.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.517
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU
AND MRS. BRAVERMAN THINK

20:52.560 --> 20:53.629
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

20:53.660 --> 20:55.969
- THAT IS NOT THE CASE.
I DON'T KNOW--

20:56.010 --> 20:58.069
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND, SIR.

20:58.110 --> 21:01.762
BUT WHATEVER BOGEYMAN
YOU THINK I AM...

21:01.810 --> 21:04.836
I'M NOT THAT GUY.

21:04.880 --> 21:08.464
NOT ANYMORE.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.297
- YOU CAME HERE TO MY OFFICE.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.776
YOU'RE TALKING TO ME
LIKE A MAN...I APPRECIATE THAT.

21:12.820 --> 21:14.708
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T THINK

21:14.750 --> 21:15.785
YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH
FOR MY DAUGHTER.

21:15.820 --> 21:19.335
IT'S THAT HADDIE
WILL BE AN ADULT,

21:19.380 --> 21:21.826
DEALING WITH ADULT THINGS
FOR MOST OF HER LIFE.

21:21.860 --> 21:24.420
BUT RIGHT NOW, SHE'S 16,

21:24.450 --> 21:27.510
AND HER MOTHER AND I WANT HER
TO BE 16

21:27.560 --> 21:32.008
WITHOUT RUSHING INTO ADULTHOOD
FOR AS LONG AS SHE CAN.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.352
YOU KNOW WHERE I'M COMING FROM?
- I GET IT.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.770
I WONDER HOW I WOULD HAVE
TURNED OUT

21:41.810 --> 21:43.437
IF I HAD PARENTS LIKE YOU.

21:43.470 --> 21:47.122
YOU'RE A GOOD DAD,
MR. BRAVERMAN.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.957
- THANK YOU.

21:48.990 --> 21:50.469
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

21:54.030 --> 21:56.134
- ALEX...

21:56.170 --> 22:01.449
I WISH YOU'D HAD SOMEONE WHO...

22:01.490 --> 22:02.969
CARED FOR YOU THAT WAY
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

22:03.010 --> 22:04.079
YOU DESERVE THAT.

22:04.110 --> 22:07.523
- HADDIE WAS THE CLOSEST THING
I'VE HAD TO FAMILY

22:07.560 --> 22:10.120
IN A REALLY LONG TIME,
SIR.

22:10.150 --> 22:13.460
IT'S FELT GOOD.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.679
- WELL, AMY'S ADORABLE IN IT.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.688
BUT LISTEN, I HAVE LILY'S DAD
ON THE OTHER LINE.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.371
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?
OKAY, THANKS.

22:31.410 --> 22:33.059
HEY, DAN. SO LISTEN,

22:33.110 --> 22:35.032
THERE IS ROOM ON THE SIDE
OF THE STAGE FOR A TRIPOD,

22:35.070 --> 22:38.107
AND WE WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE VIDEO, SO...

22:38.140 --> 22:40.859
WELL, ACTUALLY, JABBAR'S NOT
GONNA BE FEATURED IN IT ANYMORE.

22:40.910 --> 22:42.798
HE'S JUST IN THE CHOIR, SO...

22:42.840 --> 22:44.114
YEAH. OKAY.

22:44.150 --> 22:45.879
- LET'S GO, BUDDY.
TIME FOR SCHOOL.

22:45.910 --> 22:47.901
- OKAY, MOMMY.
- ALL RIGHT.

22:47.950 --> 22:52.159
I'LL SEE YOU DOWN THERE.

22:52.190 --> 22:55.125
- SO BIG DAY.
- YEAH, BIG DAY'S HERE.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.401
EVERYONE'S FIRED UP.
- GOOD.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.022
- EVERYONE BUT OUR SON,
WHO'S BRUSHING HIS TEETH

23:00.060 --> 23:01.504
LIKE IT'S ANY OLD DAY.

23:01.550 --> 23:03.063
- I KNOW YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED,

23:03.100 --> 23:04.089
BUT IT DOESN'T
TAKE ANYTHING AWAY

23:04.140 --> 23:05.061
FROM WHAT YOU'RE ACCOMPLISHING
FOR THE SCHOOL.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.727
- YEAH, THE ONLY PERSON
IT TAKES AWAY FROM

23:06.760 --> 23:08.614
IS OUR SON.
- ALL RIGHT.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.207
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS
ALREADY, CROSBY.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.411
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
HE HAS TWO PARENTS, OKAY?

23:12.460 --> 23:14.451
I'M 50%,
AND YOU'RE 50%.

23:14.490 --> 23:16.902
BUT FOR SOME REASON, YOU ACT
LIKE THE CAPTAIN ALL THE TIME,

23:16.940 --> 23:18.453
AND I'M THE FIRST MATE.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.070
I WANT MY VOTE COUNTED.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.008
- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANYONE GETTING THEIR WAY.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.597
IT'S ABOUT JABBAR.
- THAT ISWHAT IT'S ABOUT!

23:23.640 --> 23:26.916
YOU DON'T EVEN FACTOR IN
WHAT MY OPINION IS, OKAY?

23:26.950 --> 23:29.669
HE'S A NATURAL, ALL RIGHT.
HE'S A HAM, JUST LIKE YOU.

23:29.710 --> 23:31.154
AND IF WE GIVE HIM AN OUT
RIGHT NOW,

23:31.200 --> 23:33.543
WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE THAT
WE DON'T THINK HE CAN DO IT.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.717
- I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO PUSH HIM INTO DOING SOMETHING

23:34.750 --> 23:35.921
THAT HE'S UNCOMFORTABLE WITH.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.781
- LIKE I'M GONNA MAKE HIM
UNCOMFORTABLE?

23:38.830 --> 23:40.923
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE MY SON
UNCOMFORTABLE.

23:40.970 --> 23:42.926
I WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER SHOT

23:42.970 --> 23:45.131
AT GETTING HIM
TO CHANGE HIS MIND.

23:45.180 --> 23:49.526
ALL RIGHT?

23:49.560 --> 23:51.243
- FINE. FINE.

23:51.290 --> 23:53.008
BUT DON'T COME TO ME
FOR THE THERAPY BILLS

23:53.050 --> 23:54.494
WHEN HE'S DAMAGED
FOR LIFE.

23:54.530 --> 23:56.111
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'M NOT GONNA BE

23:56.150 --> 23:58.118
SENDING HIM TO THERAPY,
SO...

24:04.890 --> 24:06.084
- HEY.
- HI.

24:06.130 --> 24:08.098
- YEAH, WELL, WE'RE ALL
GONNA GO TO THE PLAY

24:08.130 --> 24:09.233
IN THE CAR TOGETHER.

24:09.270 --> 24:11.852
- OKAY.
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WEARING?

24:11.890 --> 24:14.199
- YES, DAD, THIS IS
WHAT I'M WEARING.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.162
- OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:16.210 --> 24:18.895
- I'M COUNTING MY TIPS.
IT'S FUN.

24:18.940 --> 24:21.511
- HOW COME?

24:21.560 --> 24:26.213
- BECAUSE DREW HAD
THIS ASSIGNMENT FOR SCHOOL

24:26.250 --> 24:28.047
WHERE HE HAD TO RAISE
$500

24:28.080 --> 24:29.217
SO HE CAN PLAY
IN THE BASEBALL TOURNAMENT.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.739
HE HAD TO SELL
THIS WRAPPING PAPER,

24:30.770 --> 24:33.011
HE DIDN'T SELL IT, AND--
- HOW MUCH IS HE SHORT?

24:33.050 --> 24:34.984
- OVER $300.
- OH, MY GOSH.

24:35.020 --> 24:36.248
AND YOU WANT TO BAIL HIM OUT.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.506
- OH, I'D LOVE
TO BE ABLE TO,

24:37.540 --> 24:38.677
BUT THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA
HAPPEN.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.189
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

24:40.230 --> 24:42.095
I DON'T KNOW, SARAH.

24:42.130 --> 24:43.165
I THINK YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.815
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOTTA
TEACH HIM

24:44.860 --> 24:46.714
HOW TO STAND
ON HIS OWN TWO FEET.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.684
I MEAN, ANY MORON CAN
BAIL THEIR KIDS OUT, YOU KNOW.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.233
- THESE KIDS HAVE BEEN STANDING
ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET

24:51.280 --> 24:52.611
SINCE THE DAY THEY WERE BORN.

24:52.660 --> 24:56.005
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS...
BE THE MORON.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.861
- RIGHT.

24:58.910 --> 25:00.593
GUESS THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, HUH?

25:00.630 --> 25:01.733
- I GUESS NOT.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.451
IT JUST DOES NOT SEEM
LIKE JUSTICE.

28:27.490 --> 28:29.048

I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M

SHE'S DOING IT SO THAT
YOUR FEELINGS DON'T GET HURT.

35:14.660 --> 35:15.752
TOGETHER

35:15.800 --> 35:22.808
[cheers and applause]

35:23.940 --> 35:27.831
[cell phone vibrates]

35:27.880 --> 35:31.805
- HELLO?
- HADDIE?

35:31.850 --> 35:33.772
- YEAH?
- YOUR COUSIN IS PRETTY BOLD.

35:33.820 --> 35:37.642
- I MEAN, YEAH,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.955
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I'M JUST GONNA SAY THIS.

35:39.990 --> 35:41.378
AFTER EVERYTHING
WENT DOWN WITH YOU,

35:41.410 --> 35:42.638
I HAD TO CALL MY SPONSOR.

35:42.690 --> 35:45.545
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, YEAH.

35:45.590 --> 35:47.273
I'M FINE.

35:47.310 --> 35:49.346
HE TOLD ME IN THE BEGINNING
I SHOULDN'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

35:49.380 --> 35:54.909
FOR THE FIRST YEAR,
AND NOW I KNOW WHY.

35:54.940 --> 35:56.760
- I FEEL TERRIBLE.

35:56.800 --> 35:57.835
- NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL BAD.

35:57.870 --> 35:59.428
I CARE ABOUT YOU
A WHOLE LOT,

35:59.460 --> 36:01.451
BUT IF THINGS ARE GONNA
WORK OUT BETWEEN US,

36:01.500 --> 36:03.661
YOU GOTTA MAKE THINGS RIGHT
WITH YOUR FOLKS.

36:03.710 --> 36:06.258
- THEIR MINDS ARE MADE UP.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.882
I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS
REALLY JUST UNFAIR.

36:08.920 --> 36:09.887
- IT IS UNFAIR.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.957
IT IS WHAT IT IS, THOUGH.

36:12.990 --> 36:15.993
I MISS YOU.

36:16.030 --> 36:19.511
BYE.

36:19.550 --> 36:21.723
- I WILL STAND HERE

36:21.760 --> 36:25.969
AND BURN MY SKIN

36:34.430 --> 36:36.352
- GOT THE MOUNTAINS
WE GOT THE SEA

36:36.400 --> 36:37.844
GOT AVOCADOS

36:37.880 --> 36:40.326
- THANKS, CROSBY.
YOU'RE A GOOD DIRECTOR.

36:40.370 --> 36:42.361
- OH, THANKS, JENSEN.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.810
- GREAT JOB. THANKS AGAIN.

36:43.850 --> 36:46.330
- WELL, I AM THE TOAST
OF THE TOWN.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.190
I'M SO POPULAR.
- MM-HMM.

36:54.930 --> 36:57.558
- SO HE WAS PRETTY
UNBELIEVABLE, RIGHT?

36:57.590 --> 37:00.343
- YEAH, HE WAS AMAZING.
- AND?

37:00.390 --> 37:06.625
- AND...I'M REALLY PROUD
OF BOTH OF YOU.

37:06.670 --> 37:09.355
- YOU KNOW, YOU WON'T
SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST

37:09.390 --> 37:10.971
IF YOU WERE TO SAY
"CROSBY WAS RIGHT."

37:11.020 --> 37:12.806
IT WON'T KILL YOU.

37:12.850 --> 37:14.602
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
YOU BEING RIGHT.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.017
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
- OH, HAVE YOU LOOKED AT HIM?

37:17.060 --> 37:18.539
HE'S LIKE A WHOLE NEW GUY.

37:18.580 --> 37:19.956
- WE GOT THE SEA

37:19.990 --> 37:22.367
- SEE HOW CONFIDENT HE IS?
- OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT...

37:22.410 --> 37:23.854
- MM-HMM.

37:23.890 --> 37:25.369
- BECAUSE OUR BRAVE
AND TALENTED SON

37:25.410 --> 37:26.513
STEPPED TO THE PLATE.

37:26.550 --> 37:28.689
- HMM.
- YOU GOT LUCKY.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.689
- I GOT LUCKY.
- YOU GOT LUCKY.

37:31.730 --> 37:34.483
- [makes popping sounds]
- YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA ENTER YOU

37:34.520 --> 37:37.455
IN THE MISS STUBBORN
AMERICAN PAGEANT.

37:37.490 --> 37:40.459
AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
WIN FIRST PLACE.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.682
- HEY, MAX, WILL YOU
GIVE THIS TO AMBER?

37:58.720 --> 38:00.881
- YEAH.
- I MADE A PHONE CALL,

38:00.930 --> 38:01.954
SO IF YOU WANT TO
GROUND ME AGAIN

38:02.000 --> 38:04.924
OR TAKE SOMETHING AWAY,
GO FOR IT.

38:07.420 --> 38:08.489
OKAY?
- YEAH.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.657
- I'M GONNA WALK HOME.
- HADDIE...

38:09.700 --> 38:10.792
- YOU'RE GONNA WALK HOME.
- YEAH.

38:10.840 --> 38:11.966
- IT'S DARK.

38:12.010 --> 38:13.147
IT'S NOT SAFE.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

38:13.180 --> 38:16.422
- I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE CAR
WITH YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW.

38:16.460 --> 38:20.044
OKAY?

38:22.710 --> 38:23.938
- HADDIE.

38:23.990 --> 38:27.084
- HONEY, IT'S FINE.

38:27.130 --> 38:30.679
SHE CAN WALK.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.745
- COME ON, GUYS, LET'S GO!

38:32.790 --> 38:34.371
- DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD CALL A CAB

38:34.410 --> 38:35.570
TO TAKE US TO THE CAR?

38:35.620 --> 38:37.019
- NOW, NOW.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

38:37.070 --> 38:38.992
I DIDN'T WANT TO PARK
IN THAT PARKING LOT

38:39.040 --> 38:40.610
BECAUSE IT TAKES TOO LONG
TO GET THE CAR OUT.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.036
IT'S RIGHT OVER HERE.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.698
I MEAN, YOU THINK YOU CAN
MAKE IT, FOR PETE'S SAKE?

38:44.730 --> 38:46.550
- I DON'T KNOW. I'LL TRY.
- SEE, IT'S RIGHT THERE.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.864
WE CAN GET OXYGEN ON THE WAY
IF YOU LIKE.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.458
- SO, DREW, WHAT'D YOU THINK
OF YOUR COUSINS?

38:51.500 --> 38:52.979
PRETTY CUTE, HUH?
- IT WAS CUTE.

38:53.020 --> 38:55.591
IT WASN'T AS BAD
AS I HAD EXPECTED.

38:55.640 --> 38:59.918
- WHAT AN AMAZING REVIEW,
AL ROKER--THROUGH THE ROOF.

38:59.950 --> 39:01.429
- WHY ARE YOU CALLING HIM
AL ROKER?

39:01.470 --> 39:02.983
- THUMBS UP.
- ROKER DOESN'T REVIEW MOVIES.

39:03.030 --> 39:04.952
- NO, MOM, NOT THUMBS UP.
- YES, HE DOES.

39:04.990 --> 39:07.163
- NO, HE DOESN'T.
MAYBE AT HOME WITH HIS WIFE.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.998
- HE'S A WEATHER MAN.
- CAN YOU OPEN UP THE BACK, DAD?

39:10.030 --> 39:12.999
DAD, I JUST WANT TO PUT THESE
IN THERE, OKAY?

39:13.040 --> 39:16.828
THEY'RE VERY HEAW
FOR CAKES.

39:16.870 --> 39:20.033
DAD...
- WHAT?

39:39.030 --> 39:44.024
[banging pots, cupboards]

39:52.450 --> 39:54.759
- WHERE'S THE PEANUT BUTTER?
- STOP IT.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.030
- STOP WHAT?
- THIS IS OVER.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.593
OKAY?
ALL OF IT IS OVER.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.212
- WHAT? WHAT IS OVER.
- SLAMMING THE CABINETS,

40:01.260 --> 40:04.218
THE MOPING, THE BEING RUDE--
ALL OF IT'S OVER. OKAY?

40:04.260 --> 40:06.012
JUST STOP.
- OKAY.

40:06.050 --> 40:08.848
SO THEN, WHEN CAN I
SEE ALEX?

40:10.990 --> 40:12.150
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.508
AS LONG AS YOU LIVE
IN OUR HOUSE,

40:13.540 --> 40:15.428
YOU'RE GONNA ABIDE
BY OUR RULES, OKAY?

40:15.480 --> 40:17.198
AND STICK TO OUR RULES,
THAT'S IT. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

40:20.690 --> 40:24.683
- ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:24.730 --> 40:28.029
- REALLY?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

40:28.080 --> 40:30.833
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

40:32.770 --> 40:38.970
- THERE'S NO
SAVING ANYTHING

40:39.020 --> 40:43.536
NOW WE'RE SWALLOWING
THE SHINE OF THE SUN

40:43.570 --> 40:49.816
THERE'S NO SAVING
ANYTHING

40:49.860 --> 40:52.192
AH, WE SWALLOW THE SUN

40:52.240 --> 40:56.199
- HEY.
- HEY.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.868
- WHAT'S WRONG? ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU LOOK UPSET.

40:58.900 --> 41:03.519
- UM, I WAS--
I WAS WONDERING

41:03.560 --> 41:06.905
IF I COULD STAY HERE
FOR A WHILE.

41:06.940 --> 41:09.568
- HI, SWEETIE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

41:09.600 --> 41:16.085
- UM, I--
CAN I STAY HERE?

41:16.120 --> 41:19.192
FOR A WHILE.

41:19.230 --> 41:21.460
- HOW LONG A WHILE?

41:23.650 --> 41:26.756
- I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
COLLEGE?

41:26.790 --> 41:30.749
- THAT'S TAKEN US OVER

41:37.560 --> 41:39.551
AND IT'S TAKING FOREVER
