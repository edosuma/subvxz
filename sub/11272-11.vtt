WEBVTT

00:06.300 --> 00:09.717
A Bloody Mary for you. Vodka Collins,

00:09.888 --> 00:13.721
and an Old Fashioned,
Iight on the bitters.

00:13.893 --> 00:18.106
Diane, I think you got it perfect this time.

00:18.274 --> 00:20.979
Every drink wrong.

00:22.988 --> 00:25.028
My God, what is this?

00:25.199 --> 00:28.949
Does your waitressing stink!

00:29.121 --> 00:32.122
- My waitressing does not stink.
- lt does, too.

00:32.292 --> 00:34.036
- lt doesn't.
- Does.

00:34.211 --> 00:37.415
If I put my mind to it,
I could waitress circles around you.

00:37.591 --> 00:40.129
You stink!

00:40.970 --> 00:46.725
- I smell a wager.
- No, you smell your waitressing.

00:48.188 --> 00:51.106
I challenge you to a waitressing contest.

00:51.275 --> 00:53.981
Whoever gets the most tips
tonight wins.

00:54.154 --> 00:58.283
You're on, sucker.
I'll even give you a ten buck head start.

00:58.451 --> 01:02.284
That's an insult! And thank you.

01:05.251 --> 01:09.167
We'll need a judge to make sure
this contest is conducted fairly.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.748
It's Sam's bar, he can be judge.

01:11.927 --> 01:14.549
I'm honoured, but wouldn't it be better

01:14.722 --> 01:17.392
to find someone
who gives a rat's behind?

01:20.146 --> 01:24.014
- I do, make me the judge.
- We couldn't have a more impartial one.

01:24.193 --> 01:28.737
Thank you, Diane. lf either of you
suspects any wrongdoing,

01:28.907 --> 01:32.242
come to me and I'll make
an immediate and final decision.

01:32.412 --> 01:35.532
- Do we have any appeal?
- I think you're both cute,

01:35.708 --> 01:38.709
but that's not going to
affect my decision.

02:56.437 --> 03:00.483
Get ready for the good times.
The big guy doth approach.

03:10.580 --> 03:14.626
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm?

03:14.794 --> 03:16.834
Norman?

03:17.840 --> 03:19.833
Why don't you sit down, Norm?

03:31.399 --> 03:33.973
What's the problem?

03:34.153 --> 03:38.068
You know that job I landed
over in Braintree?

03:39.576 --> 03:43.196
I had to take a company physical
this afternoon

03:43.373 --> 03:46.328
and there was something
on the chest X-ray.

03:46.502 --> 03:50.631
- Something bad, Normie?
- No, a happy face.

03:52.677 --> 03:58.551
Sorry, Coach. Yes, something bad.
A spot of some sort.

03:58.726 --> 04:02.772
They sent it over to a specialist
to take a look.

04:02.940 --> 04:07.484
Come on, Norm,
these things happen sometimes

04:07.696 --> 04:11.113
and they turn out to be nothing,
They come to nothing.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.369
Yeah, we all come to nothing, Sam.

04:14.538 --> 04:17.029
I'm just going to get there a little sooner.

04:17.208 --> 04:22.370
Norman, you're jumping to conclusions.
Now stop being so morbid.

04:23.717 --> 04:27.585
Ever since I heard this news,
all I can think of

04:27.764 --> 04:31.597
is how I may be coming to the end
of my life with nothing to show for it.

04:31.769 --> 04:37.726
You've got all of us, your friends.
We're going to be with you all the way.

04:37.902 --> 04:42.696
We're going to have to have the surgery
and everything, Diane?

04:42.867 --> 04:45.193
I'm not saying I won't do it!

04:46.538 --> 04:51.082
- I'll explain it later, Coach.
- Everybody says, ''I'll explain it later.''

04:54.382 --> 04:58.333
Cheers. Oh, hi. Yeah.

04:59.597 --> 05:03.726
Norm, it's Vera.
She needs to talk to you right away.

05:03.894 --> 05:06.516
She's heard from the doctor.

05:23.628 --> 05:25.870
Hi, honey.

05:26.048 --> 05:29.797
Yeah, that's what I figured.
So what did he say?

05:36.061 --> 05:39.015
That's the greatest news.
I can't believe it.

05:39.190 --> 05:41.562
Yes, we do have
something to celebrate.

05:41.735 --> 05:47.075
So what are you going to do?
That sounds good.

05:47.242 --> 05:50.279
I don't know what I'll do,
but I can't think about it now,

05:50.454 --> 05:54.287
I have a lot of other things on my mind.
I'll talk to you later, honey.

05:54.459 --> 05:57.034
A flaw on the X-ray.

05:57.213 --> 06:02.422
- Let me buy you a drink, Normie.
- No, not right now, Cliff.

06:02.595 --> 06:04.921
Right now I'm going to take a little walk

06:05.098 --> 06:10.225
with a gentleman I haven't paid
attention to lately... Norm Peterson.

06:10.397 --> 06:15.356
- I think I understand.
- I don't, but I'm sure you'll tell me later.

06:20.118 --> 06:23.653
Carla, counting the ten buck
head start you gave Diane,

06:23.831 --> 06:28.660
you're still ahead nine dollars.
And you've got only one minute to go.

06:28.837 --> 06:32.254
Yeah, but Diane gave me
a good contest.

06:32.425 --> 06:36.294
I mean, she hustled
what passes for her buns off tonight.

06:36.472 --> 06:40.970
- Good. So you won't rub her nose in it?
- To the bone.

06:42.230 --> 06:47.392
Thank you very much, and a happy
fiftieth wedding anniversary to you both.

06:47.570 --> 06:51.403
- Fiftieth anniversary!
- They had a bottle of Dom Perignon.

06:51.575 --> 06:55.621
I thought they were just
a couple of cheap old coots!

06:55.789 --> 06:57.829
Coach, a twenty dollar tip.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.628
- That's it! Diane wins it!
- Really?

07:05.343 --> 07:07.632
This is so exciting!

07:07.804 --> 07:10.890
Yeah, who's going to sleep tonight?

07:12.686 --> 07:15.474
Don't hurt me!

07:15.648 --> 07:20.311
I didn't mean to gloat, Carla. I'm sorry.
Please don't hurt me.

07:22.615 --> 07:25.701
I just wanted to shake your hand,

07:25.869 --> 07:31.541
but if you don't want to shake my hand,
I'll just say congratulations.

07:40.388 --> 07:43.639
Sometimes there is no pleasure
in conquest.

07:43.809 --> 07:47.226
I haven't forgotten
our first night together either.

07:55.575 --> 07:58.945
- Did you find Norm?
- Yeah, is he weirding out.

07:59.121 --> 08:02.621
- What do you mean?
- I found him sitting in a garden.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.035
He said he wanted to smell the roses.

08:05.921 --> 08:10.170
- I don't think that's weird.
- lt was a vegetable garden.

08:12.930 --> 08:14.509
That's weird.

08:14.683 --> 08:19.227
Yeah, I said that. He said, ''So I want to
smell the squash. Leave me alone.''

08:19.397 --> 08:21.936
Then he wandered on towards the pier.

08:22.109 --> 08:25.444
I shudder to think
what he wants to smell down there.

08:27.866 --> 08:31.071
This is that bar I was telling you about.

08:33.039 --> 08:36.873
These people sit here night after night,
wasting their lives away.

08:37.044 --> 08:39.916
But don't hate them. Pity them, as I do.

08:40.591 --> 08:45.255
They're chained here,
unable to soar free like you and me.

08:48.810 --> 08:50.969
Soar, little guy, soar.

08:59.950 --> 09:02.192
You want to have a beer or something?

09:02.370 --> 09:05.822
No time for that.
I just stopped in to say goodbye.

09:05.999 --> 09:08.076
I'm sailing for Bora Bora.

09:10.004 --> 09:11.547
Bora Bora?

09:11.715 --> 09:14.800
Ever since I was a boy,
the South Pacific has called,

09:14.969 --> 09:18.505
''Come to me, Norm.
This is where you belong.''

09:18.682 --> 09:20.889
I've always ignored that call, till now.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.098
So I'm going to go to the beach
and build a hut,

09:24.273 --> 09:27.191
send for Vera,
and live there the rest of our lives.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.353
Isn't that nice?

09:29.530 --> 09:33.529
I booked passage on one of those
cargo ships where you work light duties.

09:33.702 --> 09:35.861
We shove off at midnight, so...

09:36.038 --> 09:39.491
Wait a minute. What about a passport?
What about shots?

09:39.668 --> 09:41.708
I already have my passport.

09:41.879 --> 09:45.463
You don't need shots
for Bora Bora, there's no disease there.

09:45.634 --> 09:48.173
Lunacy is on its way.

09:49.180 --> 09:52.965
Norm? What about
that great new job you got?

09:53.144 --> 09:55.849
I should really call that guy, shouldn't l?

09:58.275 --> 10:00.315
Sam, you see what he's doing, right?

10:00.486 --> 10:03.654
The old jokemeister,
tugging at our ankles?

10:03.824 --> 10:06.114
Hold onto your socks,
here he goes.

10:06.828 --> 10:10.447
Hi, Mr Feldman, sir?
Hi, Norm Peterson here.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.951
Awfully sorry to wake you, sir.

10:13.128 --> 10:15.667
I'm not coming to work tomorrow.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.592
I'm sailing to Bora Bora
to live in a hut.

10:20.262 --> 10:22.932
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am in a bar.

10:24.476 --> 10:27.561
No, my head's quite clear, sir.
I'm quitting.

10:28.815 --> 10:33.312
Yes, I realise I'm burning my bridges,
but there's no hard feelings on this end.

10:33.488 --> 10:37.023
In fact, if you're ever in Bora Bora,
stop by the Peterson hut

10:37.201 --> 10:41.200
and we'll share a cup of grog, sir.
Maybe I'll take you out...

10:41.373 --> 10:44.375
Right, I realise it's late, sir. Very sorry.

10:47.547 --> 10:50.122
I pity that man.

10:51.761 --> 10:57.469
Sammy, I want you to give these
to some poor soul who may need them.

11:04.027 --> 11:07.943
Well, everybody, this is goodbye.

11:08.116 --> 11:13.159
I don't know what to say to you folks.
You've been like family to me.

11:13.331 --> 11:18.125
- I'm going to miss you all, that's for sure.
- Come on, man, this is nuts.

11:18.296 --> 11:21.997
People don't drop everything
and sail away to Bora Bora.

11:23.010 --> 11:26.843
- I do.
- Goodbye, Normie.

11:27.015 --> 11:30.848
Coach, you'll feel silly
when he pulls the plug on this gag.

11:31.020 --> 11:35.850
- You understand, don't you, Coach?
- No, Normie, but they'll tell me later.

11:38.447 --> 11:43.324
You better get used to that.
They got all-male crews on those ships.

11:44.246 --> 11:48.577
OK, Norm, joke's over.
Knock it off. lt's ended.

11:50.671 --> 11:52.629
Norm...

11:56.554 --> 12:00.968
You kidder.
Boy, you had us going there for a while.

12:02.979 --> 12:07.143
Wingtips are for accountants, Cliffie. I'm
a beachcomber now.

12:22.754 --> 12:24.415
Normie's gone.

12:32.809 --> 12:35.846
Here you are.
The service was excellent.

12:36.021 --> 12:41.527
That was nothing. You should have
seen me in the old days.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.938
I was something then.

12:44.115 --> 12:51.164
I'm telling you, people would come from
miles away to see me schlep drinks.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.492
That was before...

12:53.669 --> 12:56.422
The Troubles.

12:57.633 --> 13:03.174
She should be over this by now, it's
been weeks. I robbed her zest for life.

13:03.348 --> 13:05.555
You do have that effect on people.

13:07.979 --> 13:12.393
Sam, we got another letter from Normie.

13:13.487 --> 13:16.322
Oh, good. Norm letter here, everybody.

13:18.243 --> 13:21.613
OK, let me see here.

13:21.789 --> 13:26.417
He says he's found the beach
he was looking for and he's built a hut.

13:26.587 --> 13:31.927
Wait, listen to this, ''I'll send for Vera
when l've built hers, ha ha!

13:33.846 --> 13:37.631
''Whoops, l've lost my hammer, ha ha!''

13:37.810 --> 13:41.891
- He put the ''ha ha's'' in.
- Good thing.

13:43.150 --> 13:48.063
''Every morning, a native girl
Ieaves a coconut outside my door.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.242
''I'm a little shaky
on the local tribal customs,

13:51.411 --> 13:56.751
''so either we're married or I'm going to
be sacrificed next Tuesday, ha ha!''

13:56.918 --> 14:00.703
He sure knows
where to put those ''ha ha's''.

14:01.591 --> 14:04.758
'' Prhi, or goodbye. Norm.''

14:06.931 --> 14:11.261
It took a great deal of courage
for Norman to do what he did.

14:11.437 --> 14:17.691
I admire and envy him. He has heeded
Thoreau who admonished us that, quote,

14:17.862 --> 14:23.736
''Life is frittered away by detail.
Simplify, simplify.''

14:24.829 --> 14:28.033
Why didn't he just say one 'simplify'?

14:31.963 --> 14:34.918
Let me see the old postmark there,
Sammy.

14:36.970 --> 14:40.174
Yep, she's valid, all right.

14:40.349 --> 14:43.849
Looks like our Normie
made it to paradise.

14:44.020 --> 14:45.349
Yeah.

14:45.522 --> 14:48.524
Two Scotch rocks, Coach. No hurry.

14:48.693 --> 14:52.277
I'll wait till the good waitress
gets her order.

14:54.284 --> 15:00.205
Carla, you are the better waitress.
It's been proven time and time again.

15:00.375 --> 15:03.543
What does it matter who won
that meaningless contest?

15:03.713 --> 15:06.501
It matters.

15:06.675 --> 15:10.259
What would it take
to make you feel better?

15:11.932 --> 15:16.310
- Hearing you admit that you cheated.
- Carla, I didn't cheat.

15:16.479 --> 15:19.101
Would it kill you to say you did?

15:21.194 --> 15:27.649
- I did not cheat.
- Two words to restore my will to live.

15:28.536 --> 15:31.823
It doesn't seem like that much to ask.

15:34.461 --> 15:36.620
OK, Carla, I cheated.

15:36.797 --> 15:42.718
You cheated? Why?
That contest meant that much to you?

15:42.888 --> 15:46.009
You are a very sick woman.

15:46.184 --> 15:50.100
Does anybody in this bar realise
how sick this woman is?

15:50.273 --> 15:54.106
- She cheated on that silly little contest.
- I did not cheat!

15:54.278 --> 15:57.731
First she says she cheated,
then she says she didn't.

15:57.908 --> 16:00.863
What are we supposed to believe?

16:02.330 --> 16:08.251
- The things people do for their egos.
- Yeah, cheating on a silly contest.

16:11.717 --> 16:15.301
I could go around explaining
to everyone what happened,

16:15.472 --> 16:18.842
but I know that I did not cheat
and that's enough.

16:19.019 --> 16:23.765
- I'll just let it drop.
- I'll be in my office if you need me.

16:25.193 --> 16:29.358
I did not cheat! We had this contest...

16:34.872 --> 16:37.578
- Evening, Sammy.
- Hey, Norm.

16:44.635 --> 16:46.260
Norm?

16:50.184 --> 16:52.391
Why aren't you in Bora Bora?

16:54.356 --> 16:56.433
Funniest thing.

16:58.111 --> 17:01.777
I chickened out,
just like everybody said I would.

17:01.949 --> 17:04.488
Never even got on the damn boat.

17:05.579 --> 17:08.782
These are getting stale, though.
Got any beer nuts?

17:08.958 --> 17:11.877
You... you've been hiding in here?

17:12.046 --> 17:14.454
Just for a week.

17:14.632 --> 17:17.253
- Why?
- You kidding?

17:17.428 --> 17:22.636
I made such a jackass out of myself,
I'd be a laughing stock if I went out there.

17:24.979 --> 17:30.686
- So you plan to stay in here forever?
- Yeah, is that a problem?

17:31.779 --> 17:36.739
The way I figure it, you can let me in in
the morning when you come to work,

17:36.911 --> 17:39.284
and when everyone goes home,
Iet me out.

17:39.456 --> 17:41.864
Just like I always did.

17:42.543 --> 17:45.331
''Just like I always did.''

17:45.506 --> 17:49.339
You get a bar stool, right?
Set it up nice and close like this.

17:49.511 --> 17:54.305
Every now and then you slip me a beer.
Come on, it'll be just like it used to be!

17:54.476 --> 17:57.513
Come on. I know how you feel, man.

17:57.688 --> 18:04.191
You had a crazy dream, announced it
to everybody and you didn't live up to it.

18:04.363 --> 18:08.148
But these people love you.
They don't care.

18:08.327 --> 18:11.032
Come on.

18:11.206 --> 18:15.121
All right, all right.

18:15.294 --> 18:19.756
It probably meant more to me
than it does to them anyway.

18:21.219 --> 18:24.635
Maybe you ought to...

18:25.474 --> 18:29.805
A toast to the man the natives are
probably calling the Great Tanned Beast.

18:29.980 --> 18:34.061
An inspiration to us all,
Norm Peterson!

18:37.281 --> 18:40.817
The sofa opens out into a bed, and...

18:41.995 --> 18:44.867
- Laundry day is...?
- Tuesday.

18:46.334 --> 18:50.285
I have never cheated
on anything in my life.

18:50.465 --> 18:55.009
The integrity of Diane Chambers
remains unblemished.

18:55.179 --> 18:57.588
Could we chat for just a second?

18:59.518 --> 19:02.603
Trust me. These people
are your friends. Just listen.

19:02.772 --> 19:08.480
Another toast. To Paul Gauguin, Robert
Louis Stevenson and Norm Peterson.

19:08.655 --> 19:10.695
Three men cut from the same cloth,

19:10.866 --> 19:13.903
only they had to use
a few more yards for Norm.

19:15.372 --> 19:18.457
Yeah, Norm is quite a guy, isn't he?

19:18.626 --> 19:21.877
I don't think he had to sail
to the South Pacific

19:22.047 --> 19:25.168
to make us admire and respect him.

19:25.343 --> 19:26.542
He did for me.

19:26.720 --> 19:32.096
It was the only worthwhile thing
he ever did in an otherwise wasted life.

19:32.269 --> 19:37.146
I'm serious.
If Norm hadn't gone to Bora Bora,

19:37.317 --> 19:41.648
I don't think we would have thought
any the less of him. Do you?

19:41.823 --> 19:44.065
- Of course we would.
- Definitely.

19:44.243 --> 19:47.909
- Sam, what are you talking about?
- lt's hypothetical.

19:48.081 --> 19:52.543
Just suppose that Norm had spent
the last three weeks in a motel,

19:52.712 --> 19:58.633
and that he gave those letters to some
guy to mail when he got to the islands,

19:58.803 --> 20:01.758
we wouldn't think any the less of him.

20:01.932 --> 20:05.801
- That yellow belly is in your office!
- Don't be silly.

20:05.979 --> 20:09.432
If he's not,
he's not going to mind me doing this.

20:10.402 --> 20:14.317
Swell friends I have. That's
the last you'll see of Norm Peterson.

20:14.490 --> 20:18.275
Yellow belly, you've got
a lot of guts showing your face here!

20:18.454 --> 20:21.824
Lay off, will you?
The guy feels terrible.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.666
Yeah?
Yeah, welcome back, buddy.

20:25.838 --> 20:29.707
He's afraid that you will laugh at him
because he chickened out.

20:34.349 --> 20:40.224
Norman? Everyone has had a dream
that they let slip away.

20:40.399 --> 20:43.187
Yeah, but not one everyone knew about.

20:43.361 --> 20:47.905
- Would you like to know about mine?
- Not particularly. No.

20:49.369 --> 20:53.913
When I was a child,
I wanted to be a ballerina.

20:55.377 --> 20:57.204
I had...

21:01.301 --> 21:03.460
I had years of private lessons,

21:03.637 --> 21:08.217
but when the time finally came
to audition for the Juilliard School,

21:08.393 --> 21:13.140
with my first step
I fell down and bloodied my nose.

21:13.317 --> 21:17.362
And before I could do anything else,
they said, ''Thank you very much.''

21:17.530 --> 21:21.399
- I never heard from them again.
- Thank you very much.

21:25.082 --> 21:28.701
OK, Diane, very good, dear. Thank you.

21:30.255 --> 21:35.084
Norm, do you want to hear
a crazy, hopeless dream?

21:36.305 --> 21:40.553
I wanted to play baseball
and maybe coach a little.

21:40.727 --> 21:43.895
And then afterwards
tend a bar in a nice place.

21:44.065 --> 21:46.105
Look what happened to me.

21:47.361 --> 21:51.062
Coach, that's exactly
what happened to you.

21:51.241 --> 21:54.776
Oh, yeah.
No wonder I'm such a happy guy.

21:55.872 --> 22:00.582
Good try, Coach, good try.
Norm, has any of this helped you?

22:00.753 --> 22:03.209
Yeah, I'm doing a jig in here, Sam.

22:03.381 --> 22:05.422
Go away!

22:06.677 --> 22:10.213
All right, Sammy, clear the decks.
It's up to me.

22:11.433 --> 22:13.890
Normie, it's your best buddy.

22:14.062 --> 22:16.185
Go away, Frank.

22:18.443 --> 22:21.859
Even in pain he can make us smile.

22:23.199 --> 22:27.114
Norm? You know it's Cliffie.

22:27.287 --> 22:30.040
And l, too, once had a dream, Norm.

22:30.208 --> 22:35.666
No, more than a dream, really.
It was an all-consuming passion.

22:35.840 --> 22:42.426
- I wanted to be a trapeze artist.
- Trapeze artist? Like in a circus?

22:42.599 --> 22:45.470
No, like in your finer restaurants, Sam.

22:48.440 --> 22:53.862
When I was a lad I saw ''Trapeze''
with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis.

22:54.030 --> 22:57.566
No kidding, Cliffie.
Did you sit between them?

23:03.668 --> 23:06.242
I must have seen it 20 times.

23:06.421 --> 23:10.670
I always imagined myself up there
with them, high above the centre ring.

23:10.844 --> 23:14.890
The spotlight shines upon me,
sweat glistens from my body.

23:15.058 --> 23:18.759
Below me the women's eyes
glaze over with lust,

23:18.938 --> 23:22.604
the men grind their teeth with envy.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.731
I lunge at the bar
with almost an insane daring.

23:25.905 --> 23:31.945
I fly through the air completing, one, two,
three, oh, my God, four somersaults.

23:32.121 --> 23:35.657
The first quadruple in the history
of the big top, Norm!

23:37.921 --> 23:41.172
But, I became a postal carrier
and the rest is history.

23:43.010 --> 23:49.300
No, Norm, having a dream isn't stupid.
It's not having them that's stupid.

23:49.477 --> 23:54.520
What's stupid is the picture of you
in one of those outfits.

24:01.660 --> 24:04.234
Stop laughing at my pal here, all right?

24:04.413 --> 24:08.282
This man had the only dream
that was more ridiculous than mine.

24:10.254 --> 24:12.710
- Yeah?
- A lot more, I might add.

24:12.882 --> 24:16.252
Is that right, Marco Rollo?

24:17.680 --> 24:20.885
I've got to buy a drink here
for the great Cliffini.

24:21.060 --> 24:26.222
The next round is on me
for Ferdinand Magelly-belly.

24:26.400 --> 24:31.692
- Listen to the Flying Rear-enda here.
- ls that right, Christopher Colum-butt?
