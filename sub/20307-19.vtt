WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:05.296
DAVENPORT: <i>No, it's a bad connection.</i>
<i>I'm having trouble hearing you.</i>

00:06.172 --> 00:07.215
What?

00:07.924 --> 00:09.634
Only what I read in the papers.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.928
(door closes)

00:12.012 --> 00:14.723
Jesus, I think
you should come into my office.

00:15.473 --> 00:18.727
No, look, calm down. I'll be there.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.187
I'll meet you at 7:45.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.319
Did I hear the phone?

00:28.403 --> 00:31.531
Uh, nervous client. It was for me.

00:32.657 --> 00:33.867
You want some coffee?

00:34.325 --> 00:37.370
Okay, item seven:
Mick Belker is undercover

00:37.454 --> 00:39.372
at Michigan and 143.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.750
Our information is that a loan shark

00:41.833 --> 00:44.711
is operating a 6-for-5 operation

00:44.794 --> 00:46.838
out of a lunch wagon down there.

00:46.921 --> 00:50.383
He's feeding off the area factory workers
and the construction workers.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.845
Now Mick's gonna be running
a competition roach coach.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.347
That's an area patrols alert.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.349
Eight: assignments.

00:58.433 --> 01:01.519
Wardlow rides with Ziff,
Altieri with Carson.

01:01.603 --> 01:05.732
Also, everybody say hello
to Officer Kathryn McBride.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.234
She's a transfer from the Polk.

01:08.318 --> 01:12.155
Officer McBride is gonna be
riding with Sergeant Bates.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.282
Item nine: wants and warrants.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.660
Now there's three new composites
on the upstairs board, people.

01:17.744 --> 01:21.581
Let's everybody keep
our 316 files current.

01:21.664 --> 01:25.043
Also, warrants continue on Jesus Martinez,

01:25.126 --> 01:26.544
Hispanic, late 20's,

01:26.628 --> 01:29.089
in connection with
the courthouse investigation

01:29.172 --> 01:32.467
of judge fixing in the 17th District.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.470
He's wanted for questioning
in the possible homicide

01:35.553 --> 01:37.597
of attorney Harold Brown.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.849
All right, ten: phones.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.144
-Watts line, Sarge?
-No Watts line, Bobby.

01:43.228 --> 01:47.398
No, they're re-rigging us
for a new intercom system.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.734
Now, people, these intercoms

01:49.818 --> 01:51.569
are to save time

01:51.653 --> 01:53.613
for official communications.

01:53.696 --> 01:56.741
They're not for asking a khaki
to bring you a new pencil.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.286
No, and they're not
for squad-room gossip, either.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.414
Hey, Andrew. You won't believe
what Neal said last night.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.874
Buzz me when we get upstairs.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.210
(laughing)

02:07.293 --> 02:09.170
Okay, all right, settle down here.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.799
Last. this is the last item.
Now listen, people.

02:12.882 --> 02:15.176
If you ask the opinion of the podium,

02:15.260 --> 02:17.470
this temperature up-flux that we got

02:17.554 --> 02:19.430
ain't the genuine article.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.684
My guess is we're at least
three weeks from spring.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.228
Now that's a word to the wise

02:25.311 --> 02:27.564
re: premature garment removal.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.858
This is when you could catch a doozy.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.986
-Did you ever want to be a doctor, Sarge?
-Hey, no, listen.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.864
Sometimes I think a nice string
of garlic around the neck,

02:35.947 --> 02:38.741
and you don't push this season.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.452
Half the medics would be out of business
if we all did that.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.789
Okay, that's it. Let's have a safe shift.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.958
Hey, they're getting away out there!
Come on.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.127
-(indistinct chatter)
-MAN: Alright, let's go!

02:49.627 --> 02:51.546
So, what do you go by, Kathryn?

02:51.629 --> 02:53.339
Kathryn, Kate.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.924
I figured it wouldn't be Kathy.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.720
I've just visited
the psychotherapeutic future, Henry,

02:58.803 --> 03:00.930
and it works. It's called lithium.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.849
Are you talking about Ballantine, Howard?

03:02.932 --> 03:05.476
Oh, all
of that edible gobbledygook, Henry.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.521
You know, those headshrinkers,
they just simply corrected

03:08.605 --> 03:10.732
a chemical imbalance
in that poor fellow's brain,

03:10.815 --> 03:15.445
and now he's cheerful, friendly,
and filling his hospital room

03:15.528 --> 03:18.031
with all kinds of martial science books.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.699
Got to be a good sign!

03:19.782 --> 03:21.743
(telephone rings)

03:21.826 --> 03:25.079
-What have we got, Stan?
-Just keep it out of the flow, Bobby.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.750
Junkies ripped off a government-surplus
warehouse, lieutenant.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.544
Night-shift guys
are inventorying it upstairs.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.047
-Need a hand?
-No, I think we got it, Lieutenant.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.382
Be careful with that raft, Bobby.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.968
Yeah. Oh!

03:39.552 --> 03:41.888
You done taken some religious vows, Renko?

03:42.680 --> 03:43.765
Why aren't you talking?

03:44.432 --> 03:48.061
(strained) Well, I would.
My wife burned my tongue on a casserole.

03:48.144 --> 03:49.562
A thousand degrees!

03:49.646 --> 03:50.521
Oh!

03:51.064 --> 03:53.566
Hey, guys.
You better watch out for that lanyard.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.401
-What lanyard?
-That one right there!

03:56.319 --> 03:59.447
(shouting)

03:59.530 --> 04:02.200
Ah! Oh!

04:05.828 --> 04:08.164
-What's the matter?
-Ah!

04:08.248 --> 04:09.207
What happened?

04:09.290 --> 04:11.084
I bit the place where I burnt my tongue!

04:11.167 --> 04:12.168
I can't under--

04:12.252 --> 04:14.921
I bit the place
where I had burnt my tongue!

04:15.004 --> 04:17.548
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:17.632 --> 04:19.717
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:19.801 --> 04:23.638
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:23.721 --> 04:25.181
(theme music playing)

05:31.706 --> 05:35.626
(cheerful music playing)

06:34.560 --> 06:37.855
All right,
coffee and a bear claw, that's $1.10.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.233
Thank you very much.
What are you gonna have?

06:40.316 --> 06:42.110
-Make poached eggs?
-What?

06:42.193 --> 06:43.778
Fried or scrambled?

06:43.861 --> 06:45.363
Okay, scrambled and bacon.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.490
-Coffee?
-Yeah.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.993
$1.75. Listen, I want you fellows to know

06:51.077 --> 06:53.329
we got everything on our menu
they got over there,

06:53.413 --> 06:56.290
and that includes
"get me through till payday" service.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.708
Gonna be making loans?

06:57.792 --> 06:59.585
Buck a week on every $20 you borrow.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.671
That's a lot better than Healy's rates.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.464
(horn blows)

07:03.548 --> 07:05.508
MAN: I was gonna try this guy.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.176
But I have to wait till lunch.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.595
There goes Tommy the rat.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.805
Who's he rat for?

07:10.888 --> 07:11.973
Your competition.

07:12.056 --> 07:14.183
Hey, I got nothing to hide.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.311
See me at lunch, fellows,
if you want to borrow dough.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.648
You need a driver's license
and a pay stub.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.609
No offense, buddy. You may not be around.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.069
What happened to your thumb?

07:25.153 --> 07:26.779
Late-payment charge.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.577
(horn blows)

07:32.660 --> 07:34.078
Yeah, yeah.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.081
See you fellows at lunch, huh?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.295
We get clear sledding,

07:42.378 --> 07:45.047
we got you intercom-capable
by 3:00 p.m., Sarge.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.383
-Great.
-That means no more life rafts.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.719
Well, don't let me hold you up.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.387
-Morning, Frank.
-Henry.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.890
Autopsy report on
Harold Brown, heart attack.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.267
-What did they make of the bruises?
-Couldn't rule out a struggle,

07:56.350 --> 07:58.102
but they figure
it was more likely he fell.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.563
-I guess Jesus could have pushed him.
-Any word on Jesus?

08:00.646 --> 08:02.190
Bench warrant issued this morning.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.984
Morning, Norm.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.027
Hm, how you doing?

08:06.736 --> 08:07.862
Hey, Guid.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.823
What do you want, Tommy?

08:11.866 --> 08:12.950
I got a problem.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.452
That department's closed.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.746
Hey, I'm gonna talk to you.
I got no choice.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.541
Not here.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.257
Guid, I know you're not
in my fan club anymore.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.218
But I'm jammed up.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.472
You're the only one
I ever saw him say two words to.

08:34.555 --> 08:36.432
-Who's that?
-Delaberto.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.936
I got on his wrong side five months ago.
This idiot's still got it on the brain.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.355
You're a different kind of cop
than he is, Tommy.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.689
Yeah, tell me about it.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.526
(clears throat)
What, you make him look bad?

08:47.026 --> 08:49.654
We partnered on a pop.
They said maybe some dope was missing.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.989
But everyone passed on it,

08:52.073 --> 08:54.992
internal affairs, the D.A.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.954
It's history with everyone
but this lunatic.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.250
So, uh, can he hurt you?

09:02.333 --> 09:03.543
Night we made the pop,

09:03.626 --> 09:07.463
I thought he could have seen something
he figured was me doing something wrong.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.300
Then he didn't say nothing.
I figured he didn't see it.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.636
Now I'm thinking
he's some kind of warp case

09:13.719 --> 09:16.138
who wants to pull on my wings a little
before he rats me out.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.642
Hey, the thing is, Guid,

09:20.977 --> 09:23.354
I've been thinking a lot
since you and me talked.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.940
I've been trying to clean up my act.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.068
If you could just talk to the guy,

09:29.151 --> 09:30.945
find out where he's going with this.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.075
Yeah, all right.

09:36.158 --> 09:39.120
I just hate to get ratted out
on something I did before.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.706
Hey, Tommy, I'll talk to him, okay?

09:41.789 --> 09:43.499
I'll let you know what he said.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.793
How you doing?

09:46.711 --> 09:49.839
I'm okay. I'll call you later on.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.091
-Appreciate it, Guid.
-Yeah.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.886
(static cracks)

09:55.970 --> 09:57.263
Hey, it's working great.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.515
Aha, excuse me.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.227
Are you going
to the captain's office, too?

10:03.311 --> 10:04.604
Phone installation.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.689
Intercom installation, Captain.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.107
Just pretend like I'm not here.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.359
Fast as possible, please.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.574
-Morning.
-Morning.

10:17.742 --> 10:21.037
That call I got this morning
was from Jesus Martinez, Frank.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.539
-I just went to see him.
-There's a fugitive warrant.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.751
At least temporarily,
I'm acting as his council.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.586
Frank, he's like a terrified animal.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.255
He feels like he got railroaded
on that bribery charge.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.007
Now, he's wanted in Brown's death.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.342
It's only for questioning.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.218
He wants you to meet him outside.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.638
He says he can explain everything.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.514
(static crackles)

10:42.600 --> 10:44.727
DAVENPORT:
<i>Frank, he's hiding in that laundry.</i>

10:44.810 --> 10:45.895
<i>Agitated, afraid.</i>

10:45.978 --> 10:48.105
<i>I'm afraid something terrible</i>
<i>is going to happen.</i>

10:48.189 --> 10:49.190
<i>He's waiting for it to.</i>

10:49.273 --> 10:52.568
Look, we both know Jesus has been trying
awfully hard

10:52.652 --> 10:54.362
to make something out of himself.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.405
I can't do my job ad hominem.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.491
If I meet him outside,
I'll have to bust him.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.701
Tell him to come on in.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.579
I don't think his situation's
as bleak as he thinks it is.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.289
When Jesus was a street punk,

11:05.373 --> 11:07.375
everybody gave him the extra mile.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.585
Now he's playing it by our rules,

11:09.669 --> 11:11.629
and nobody gives an inch.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.216
(telephone rings)

11:16.926 --> 11:18.803
She says Jesus is hiding
in a laundry, Neal.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.013
Doesn't his cousin run
a laundry over off Van Meer?

11:21.097 --> 11:23.349
-So?
-So let's go for a ride.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.309
Whoa, lover. This legal?

11:25.935 --> 11:28.020
We're citizens. We do laundry.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.689
(exhales)

11:32.400 --> 11:35.569
-Officer Hoh-ward Hunter?
-Yes?

11:35.653 --> 11:40.783
Ah, I'm Jagawala,
the Boopity of Bemar Besar.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.911
You have a nicer uniform
than your picture.

11:45.454 --> 11:49.375
Well, thank you very much.
But I'm a little at sea here, Mister?

11:49.458 --> 11:53.713
Jagawala.
Just call me Jaga, as all my friends do.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.006
And I ask you to understand

11:56.090 --> 11:58.843
I have lived so long in emptiness.

11:58.926 --> 12:03.222
Then this letter came,
in answer to so many of my own.

12:03.305 --> 12:07.184
Prunella, who makes my heart
boompity-boom.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.187
Oh, you're a friend of Prunella's.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.273
More than a friend, my friend.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.024
(laughing)

12:14.108 --> 12:15.735
I'm her spouse.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.530
Spouse?

12:21.615 --> 12:23.784
-Prunella's your wife?
-Wife, yes, yes.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.745
And I'm very much attracted to her.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.247
Have you ever watched her eat?

12:28.330 --> 12:30.291
Mm-mm-mm.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.625
Wonderful!

12:32.460 --> 12:34.545
I think of her, and I'm the lusty one.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.130
(laughing)

12:36.213 --> 12:38.257
Well, if what you say is true--

12:38.340 --> 12:39.633
It's very true.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.970
Well, then, uh, if that is the case,

12:43.053 --> 12:46.390
then you and Miss Ashton-Wilkes,
or rather, Mrs.--

12:46.474 --> 12:47.516
Jagawala.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.769
Jagawala have a great deal to discuss.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.147
She speaks of you as her new good friend,

12:53.230 --> 12:55.399
and she does not provide her address.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.110
You will arrange that I see her, yeah?

12:58.986 --> 13:00.696
I would have to verify your account.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.533
I am very grateful to you, Lieutenant.

13:05.242 --> 13:08.662
(traffic noises)

13:17.129 --> 13:18.047
Davenport.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.467
Oh, man.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.762
She must have come back to talk to Jesus.
J.D., I don't like this, man.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.931
-Gonna look like we followed her.
-But we didn't.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.891
No, we just listened
in to her conversation.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.184
Accidentally.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.770
Hey, she's leaving.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.482
All right, you go on in.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.858
Flush him out the back.

13:51.747 --> 13:52.957
Morning!

13:53.040 --> 13:56.752
I left some laundry for fluff and fold
with you about a week ago.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.129
-Can't find my ticket.
-What color was the bag?

13:59.213 --> 14:01.173
Purple. Name's Washington.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.259
-Yeah, I can help--
-No, I've got to look for you!

14:03.342 --> 14:04.635
Hey, I think I see it.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.388
WOMAN: You can't go back there, mister!
-Get down, ma'am!

14:07.471 --> 14:08.931
That's it, Jesus.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.766
(action music playing)

14:12.852 --> 14:15.938
-(horn honks)
-(tires screech)

14:23.946 --> 14:25.072
All right!

14:25.155 --> 14:26.824
-Put it down, Jesus!
-Don't be stupid!

14:26.907 --> 14:29.451
(suspenseful music playing)

14:29.910 --> 14:32.413
On the ground. On the ground!
Do it! Come on!

14:36.500 --> 14:38.377
-WASHINGTON: Hold still, my man.
-Hey, man.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.880
-Hey, what we got here?
-What are you doing?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.882
What you gonna do with that tape?
You're not gonna destroy it.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.592
What is it, your favorite salsa group?

14:44.675 --> 14:46.594
Nobody's gonna destroy
any evidence, Jesus.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.512
I'm begging you. It's my only shot.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.598
WASHINGTON: Hey, look.
It's in my pocket, okay?

14:53.100 --> 14:55.686
You leave anything in the dryers? Come on!

14:55.769 --> 14:56.979
Take it easy, J.D.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.652
(reggae music plays)

15:05.529 --> 15:07.197
Check out Tito Puente.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.199
Hey, Mr. Bongo!

15:09.283 --> 15:11.118
One hand on the wheel at all times.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.168
(tires screech)

15:19.251 --> 15:20.628
What, are we late for something?

15:20.711 --> 15:23.047
My kid's got a dentist appointment
in a half-hour.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.216
I reminded him before I left, but he's
a real airhead about appointments.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.801
-How old?
-13.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.136
He the only one you got?

15:29.219 --> 15:30.387
Yeah.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.181
You and your old man still together?

15:33.057 --> 15:34.934
-No. (chuckles)
-Whatever.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.769
-It's a long story.
-Whatever.

15:36.852 --> 15:37.853
(siren wails)

15:37.937 --> 15:40.105
Cop! Cop!

15:40.189 --> 15:41.106
Hey!

15:41.190 --> 15:45.819
-(tires screech)
-(siren wailing)

15:45.903 --> 15:47.446
(horn sounding)

15:50.616 --> 15:51.867
Freeze! Police!

15:55.746 --> 15:57.957
You are incredibly lucky! You know that?

15:58.457 --> 15:59.667
-(grunts)
-(thud)

16:01.627 --> 16:03.128
I could have killed you.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.715
You never run when a gun's on you!

16:06.799 --> 16:07.716
Never!

16:10.010 --> 16:11.011
(jumbled) Nice job.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.680
-What?
-Way to go.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.475
(telephone ringing)

16:18.143 --> 16:20.688
How are you? Lionel Styles, Lieutenant.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.440
Thought it was about time we shook hands,
huh? (chuckles)

16:23.524 --> 16:24.441
Styles Real Estate.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.819
Styles Real Estate, Step-Up Development,

16:26.902 --> 16:29.321
Excelsior Holdings, I'm all of them.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.408
So you put that flyer under my door

16:32.491 --> 16:34.284
about the block meeting
for tenants this afternoon.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.079
One of my managers put it there.
Yeah, that's right.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.331
-Afraid I can't make that.
-Oh, gee.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.418
I was kind of hoping we could go together,
sort of present a united front.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.878
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?

16:46.964 --> 16:50.134
You spoken to anybody
from Armitage Development yet, Lieutenant?

16:50.217 --> 16:51.802
-No.
-Ah.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.014
I think you and I are sitting
on a pretty sweet thing,

16:55.097 --> 16:57.016
especially if we move in sync.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.894
-You mean they're interested in that area?
-Yeah.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.938
That area is ready to be yuppified.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.231
Yuppified.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.943
Look, here. See, parcel by parcel,
each one of those lots

17:08.027 --> 17:11.613
is gonna go for $100,000, $150,000 apiece.

17:11.697 --> 17:14.199
But if we negotiate collectively,

17:14.283 --> 17:16.201
I think we can do a lot better.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.703
What about the tenants?

17:17.786 --> 17:20.164
That's what that tenant meeting
is gonna be about today.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.541
See, when they find
someplace else to live,

17:22.624 --> 17:26.086
well, I think that area is
gonna be some high, high rent.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.755
(laughing)

17:27.838 --> 17:29.006
That might not be easy.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.550
Oh, easy, hard, I don't see
why that's our problem.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.846
I didn't buy that building
to turn a profit.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.097
I'm concerned about the neighborhood.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.141
Whoa, whoa.
You telling me you're not collecting--

17:39.224 --> 17:42.311
I'm collecting rents,
but I'm trying to improve the place.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.022
I'm not planning on putting my tenants
out to put yuppies in.

17:45.856 --> 17:49.026
-When did you say this meeting was?
-Uh, 1:00.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.986
(sighs) I get your dander up, Lieutenant?

17:51.945 --> 17:52.780
I'm gonna be there.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.615
Good. I look forward to it.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.867
It was nice meeting you, Lieutenant.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.874
(telephone rings)

18:03.957 --> 18:06.460
Get him started through booking.
I'll tell the captain.

18:06.543 --> 18:10.172
Yo! Miss Davenport.
Did you get your Judas fee?

18:10.714 --> 18:12.591
What happened, Jesus?
How did they find you?

18:12.674 --> 18:14.468
Listen, don't let them destroy the tape.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.928
At least give me that!

18:16.011 --> 18:17.262
Don't say a word.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.516
Just pretend like I ain't here.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.683
(knocking on door)

18:24.019 --> 18:25.395
Me and Neal got lucky, Captain.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.147
We found Jesus outside a laundry.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.108
Check this cassette out, huh?

18:29.191 --> 18:31.401
(Hispanic accent)
"Attorney Brown's confession."

18:33.320 --> 18:35.656
-Did you send them after me?
-You know better than that.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.951
So you destroyed the state attorney-client
privilege law all on your own.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.202
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.287
You don't tail lawyers
to find their clients.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.206
It's been the law
for ten years, gentlemen.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.167
-We just happened to run across the guy--
-Detective,

18:47.251 --> 18:49.711
it's taking all my self-control
to keep from slapping you,

18:49.795 --> 18:52.172
but that would bring me
down to your level.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.217
Jesus told me your thugs
confiscated that tape.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.720
It could contain his confession
to the Lindbergh kidnapping

18:58.804 --> 19:00.597
for all the good it's going to do you.

19:05.435 --> 19:08.063
If you followed her,
you're up for a Board of Rights.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.815
We didn't, Captain.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.067
When you and Miss Davenport
were listening in the intercom,

19:12.151 --> 19:14.444
that came across the squad room.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.865
We couldn't help but hear.
She said something about a laundry.

19:17.948 --> 19:21.285
I remembered that Jesus' cousin runs one
down off of Van Meer.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.413
-Square business, Captain.
-Want to listen to the tape?

19:24.496 --> 19:26.039
Martinez seems to think
it's gonna exonerate--

19:26.123 --> 19:28.000
I'll get to it, okay, J.D.?

19:28.083 --> 19:29.918
See if you can get
A.D.A. Bernstein up here,

19:30.002 --> 19:32.254
and I want full 770s
on the entire incident.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.463
Yes, sir.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.759
How could they hear
a private conversation?

19:37.843 --> 19:38.844
Open circuitry.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.679
It will be like that
till we get you online.

19:40.762 --> 19:41.972
When?

19:42.055 --> 19:45.726
If we keep clear sledding,
4:00 p.m. the latest.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.144
Just pretend like I'm not here.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.112
Well, two cavities isn't so bad,

19:57.196 --> 19:58.572
considering the way you brush.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.907
I brush them good.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.825
He gives it the neighborhood job,

20:01.909 --> 20:04.453
you know, the brush
is <i>in </i>the neighborhood. (laughs)

20:04.536 --> 20:07.080
Well, the dentist told me
to have you call him.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.750
Says you haven't been in in over a year.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.920
When you pass a certain age,
you know, it's not as important.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.047
Well, I got to get back to school.

20:15.130 --> 20:18.091
-It was nice meeting you, Officer McBride.
-Good to meet you, Fabian.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.593
So you guys gonna be partners?

20:19.676 --> 20:21.511
For now. See you later, Fabes.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.763
See ya.

20:22.846 --> 20:23.722
Hey, Fabian!

20:23.805 --> 20:26.558
Don't forget to make an appointment
to have your cavities filled.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.852
I made it for next Saturday,
for both of us.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.816
He's a real charmer, for sure.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.527
He's a good kid. He likes you, too.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.112
Was he close with your partner?

20:39.196 --> 20:40.864
Joe? Sure, yeah.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.826
So we didn't talk about you yet.
You married?

20:45.369 --> 20:46.453
No.

20:46.536 --> 20:47.663
Ever been?

20:47.746 --> 20:48.789
Uh-uh.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.040
Ready?

20:50.874 --> 20:51.875
Yeah.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.672
Don't say you didn't realize
what was happening.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.049
(British accent)
You're getting that tone again, Howdy.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.801
Please just answer my question.

21:01.551 --> 21:04.471
But it was all so ritualistic, you know?

21:04.554 --> 21:07.391
Chanting, the incense, the drums.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.560
I only began to suspect what was happening

21:10.644 --> 21:13.730
when they smeared me
with indigo grease and ocher.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.275
The promotional brochure had mentioned

21:16.358 --> 21:21.947
something about that in describing
their quaint, <i>matrimonial</i> rituals.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.573
The man has a legitimate claim.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.284
Only by his own light.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.453
It would never be recognized
in our courts. Howdy?

21:29.871 --> 21:34.126
You don't for a moment think
that I'm interested in him?

21:34.626 --> 21:36.044
I really don't know what to think.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.297
Listen to me.

21:40.882 --> 21:44.553
No one has ever made
my cannons roar like you.

21:45.721 --> 21:46.847
I'm reassured.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.642
But I do think you have to see
this poor fellow

21:50.726 --> 21:53.520
and tell him where he stands,
face-to-face.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.896
Can you arrange the meeting?

21:54.980 --> 21:56.690
Yes, he's calling me this afternoon.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.609
You can talk to him tonight
and unburden him of this illusion.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.653
I'm far more interested

22:01.737 --> 22:04.072
in the possibilities of this afternoon.

22:05.782 --> 22:06.825
I'll get the check.

22:15.751 --> 22:19.046
-How you doing, Norm?
-Look at you, Vince. You fell apart, huh?

22:19.129 --> 22:21.965
(laughs) I'm just teasing.
You always look the same.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.010
So why'd you come down to precinct?

22:25.093 --> 22:26.303
See some of the other guys?

22:26.386 --> 22:29.306
It's a personal conversation
about Tommy Donahue.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.640
Yeah.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.684
I understand there was a problem

22:32.768 --> 22:34.519
with some evidence on a pop you guys made.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.437
It got stolen.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.397
Yeah.
Evidently, you got ideas it was Tommy?

22:38.190 --> 22:41.818
Look. I'm not gonna nominate him
for <i>Cop of the Year,</i> Vin.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.654
I'm not even gonna tell you I don't think
Tommy would put the arm--

22:44.738 --> 22:46.490
What are you gonna tell me, Norm?

22:46.573 --> 22:48.241
(clears throat) Well...

22:48.992 --> 22:52.788
uh, kid seems like he's trying
to pull himself together.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.540
And if it's something more
or less under the bridge,

22:55.624 --> 22:57.209
he says the case is closed.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.627
He's two years younger than us.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.337
Sorry?

23:00.796 --> 23:01.922
Donahue's not a kid.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.885
All right? The file is closed,
but there are two entries in our jackets.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.929
It doesn't matter to him,
but it matters to me.

23:09.012 --> 23:11.598
I'm just wondering, if you give him
the benefit of the doubt--

23:11.681 --> 23:13.058
What doubt, Norm?

23:13.683 --> 23:16.186
I know what that little piece of garbage
did, and I'm gonna nail him for it.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.609
You tell him that, Norm.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.444
You tell him that my file ain't closed.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.405
Thank you. See ya.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.322
Yeah.

23:29.491 --> 23:30.784
Changed his mind.

23:40.585 --> 23:41.670
(honks)

23:45.841 --> 23:46.842
(honks)

23:51.012 --> 23:52.055
Hi.

23:53.723 --> 23:56.268
-What are you doing here?
-Do you recognize this?

23:56.810 --> 23:58.145
I'm working now.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.647
I'm on my way to Dr. Scully's,

24:00.730 --> 24:04.401
and you didn't sign this insurance form
like I asked you to do 10,000 times!

24:04.484 --> 24:05.318
Give me the form.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.864
Mick, I know you're on an operation,

24:08.947 --> 24:10.740
but I'm due in three weeks.
Dr. Scully said

24:10.824 --> 24:13.452
if we don't get this insurance form in,
I won't be able to get into the hospital.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.704
-Do you have a pen?
-Yes, I do.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.713
Oh, my God, Mick, you're on fire.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.466
Oh, God. Go away.

24:27.549 --> 24:28.842
If it's grease, use soap.

24:28.925 --> 24:30.677
Go away right now!

24:44.191 --> 24:45.692
(coughs)

25:03.502 --> 25:05.253
You set fire to my truck.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.506
Why would I do something like that?

25:07.589 --> 25:09.883
Get me to split,
which I am not going to do.

25:09.966 --> 25:11.968
Slow learner, huh, Sam?

25:13.094 --> 25:16.056
<i>No,</i> you're the slow learner, pal!

25:16.598 --> 25:17.933
I don't scare.

25:19.809 --> 25:22.062
I'm going over there
and clean up my truck.

25:22.562 --> 25:25.941
And when my food service is closed,
I'm still gonna be making loans.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.569
Don't grow too attached
to your thumbs, my friend.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.156
I've been attached to my thumbs
my whole life.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.034
Look at what my thumbs could do.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.122
-Sam!
-Come on!

25:45.001 --> 25:49.256
-So you telling us we got to move?
-STYLES: Looks like that's what's coming.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.967
Well, I ain't moving!
I'm gonna stay right where I am.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.594
-Yeah!
-Right!

25:54.678 --> 25:55.679
I'm Henry Goldblume.

25:55.762 --> 26:00.100
I own the building
on the corner of Dekker and 133rd.

26:00.183 --> 26:03.353
And although I haven't heard
Mr. Styles' plans for his tenants,

26:03.436 --> 26:04.896
I want everyone here to know

26:04.980 --> 26:06.356
I don't think you have to move.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.358
(cheering)

26:08.441 --> 26:10.902
Excuse me.
If Officer Goldblume has no objection,

26:10.986 --> 26:13.280
I would like to present my plan first.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.241
Then he can give whatever arguments
he wants to to the contrary.

26:16.324 --> 26:17.242
Fair enough.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.244
(indistinct mumbling)

26:24.124 --> 26:27.085
I'm gonna deal some cards
and let you decide how to play.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.546
Now for real, people.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.756
If a bunch of rich, white men
want to come in here

26:31.840 --> 26:33.675
and tear this neighborhood down,

26:33.758 --> 26:35.927
who out there thinks
they can stop them, hm?

26:36.011 --> 26:38.096
Who? Let me see some hands.

26:38.179 --> 26:41.141
Come on, let me see some hands.
Who? Somebody?

26:41.224 --> 26:43.310
Oh, you can stop them, brother? How?

26:43.810 --> 26:45.604
What you gonna do? Hire a lawyer?

26:46.521 --> 26:47.856
Rich man's got ten lawyers.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.317
-MAN: I heard that!
-I know you did.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.653
So what then, shoot him?

26:54.321 --> 26:56.156
Hey, white man's got all the cops.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.993
Fact is, there ain't nothing
you can do to stop them

27:00.076 --> 27:02.037
if they really want
to come in here and do it.

27:02.120 --> 27:02.996
You understand?

27:04.623 --> 27:07.709
But you could be smart and make them pay.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.294
You got tenants' rights, huh?

27:09.377 --> 27:11.463
You got leases, huh?

27:11.546 --> 27:13.298
Well, then you make them pay
to get you out!

27:13.381 --> 27:14.966
(crowd clamors)

27:15.050 --> 27:18.178
You see this ring, huh? You see that?

27:18.637 --> 27:21.181
You see this gold watch here, huh?

27:21.264 --> 27:23.391
Check the suit out, huh?

27:23.475 --> 27:25.894
My car that's parked out
front, that's a new Cadillac.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.312
(chatter)

27:27.395 --> 27:29.773
See, I was born
in this neighborhood with nothing.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.691
But I learned how to make the man pay.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.693
You got to learn it to earn it.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.445
Yeah! All right!

27:35.528 --> 27:38.990
(applauding)

27:39.074 --> 27:40.367
Now, uh...

27:41.701 --> 27:45.705
suppose the man is gonna
give you a month's free,

27:45.789 --> 27:47.415
no two months' free rent.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.416
That sound good?

27:49.584 --> 27:51.002
You like that, huh?

27:51.086 --> 27:52.712
Well, you're too easy.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.507
I'm talking about giving you
six months' free rent.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.386
Yeah, six months
before you agree to move out.

27:59.469 --> 28:02.931
And during that time, you take that money,
and you put it in your pocket.

28:03.014 --> 28:06.059
And you go out and you buy, and you enjoy.

28:06.142 --> 28:08.269
Yeah! I may even give you seven months,

28:08.353 --> 28:11.106
because I'm on a roll,
and they're gonna have to pay the toll!

28:11.189 --> 28:15.568
(applauding)

28:15.652 --> 28:18.697
Now, uh, Officer Goldblume here,

28:18.780 --> 28:23.118
he has been living up here
almost four months now.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.703
He thinks he knows what's going on.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.165
But if you want to do it my way,

28:29.916 --> 28:31.668
I got something for you
to sign at the door.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.296
Officer?

28:37.841 --> 28:41.803
I believe our neighborhood
has a potential all its own.

28:41.886 --> 28:44.472
And if we could work together,

28:44.556 --> 28:47.267
instead of seeing it destroyed,
we can improve.

28:47.350 --> 28:48.601
Improve what we have

28:48.685 --> 28:50.895
and make it something
that we can all be proud of.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.772
(chatter)

28:52.856 --> 28:55.692
-BROWN: <i>Would you listen to me, Jesus?</i>
-JESUS: <i>No, I'm through listening.</i>

28:55.775 --> 28:57.360
BROWN: <i>I know I got you into this mess.</i>

28:57.444 --> 28:59.946
JESUS: <i>You had me delivering</i>
<i>those damn envelopes to the judge.</i>

29:00.029 --> 29:02.991
BROWN: <i>And I'm gonna get you out of it,</i>
<i>but you got to let me do it my way.</i>

29:03.658 --> 29:06.745
Gap, erase, splice.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.330
JESUS:
<i>Okay, Attorney Brown, I got to go, man.</i>

29:09.414 --> 29:11.833
<i>Just as long as you know I'm innocent.</i>

29:11.916 --> 29:12.792
BROWN: <i>Okay.</i>

29:12.876 --> 29:14.377
Re-entry, re-edit.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.630
JESUS: <i>Okay,</i>
<i>so we talk tomorrow. I'm taking off.</i>

29:18.256 --> 29:20.633
<i>Yo, man, I almost tripped on your carpet.</i>

29:20.717 --> 29:22.761
-(thudding)
-Fake sound effects.

29:22.844 --> 29:25.972
You think Jesus might have handled
that 18-minute job for Watergate?

29:26.055 --> 29:28.099
Certainly didn't exculpate him from much.

29:30.268 --> 29:33.605
If anything, it adds tampering
with evidence. But is it admissible?

29:33.688 --> 29:38.193
We have been getting some better decisions
on the proceeds of questionable arrest.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.986
-There you go.
-<i>Here,</i>

29:40.069 --> 29:42.238
you would have to make the case
that they overheard

29:42.322 --> 29:45.283
the intercom conversation accidentally
and they didn't follow her.

29:45.366 --> 29:46.659
Both of which is true.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.119
Shut up, J.D.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.455
I think I'd have a tough time
selling the point

29:50.538 --> 29:54.000
that they showed up at the laundromat
the same time Joyce left,

29:54.834 --> 29:58.046
if we're pretty sure
that Jesus didn't cause Brown's death.

29:58.129 --> 30:01.049
Autopsy was inconclusive,
but that's how they've been leaning.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.384
Then if he can help us with Judge Hardin,

30:03.468 --> 30:06.387
-I'd say make a deal.
-(knocking) Excuse me. Hey, Captain,

30:06.471 --> 30:09.599
if you'll just push button number three,
you can put your precinct online.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.105
I know what that is!
That's a fuse. Two minutes!

30:16.189 --> 30:17.315
Great, great.

30:19.067 --> 30:21.319
Will you sit in
while we make the proposal to Jesus?

30:21.402 --> 30:22.320
Sure.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.952
-These babies pull a lot of juice.
-Yeah.

30:29.035 --> 30:32.038
-Sometimes they just need a bigger fuse.
-Yeah, yeah, hurry up.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.623
I'm getting it, I'm getting it.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.292
-Listen, answer me a question, will you?
-What?

30:36.376 --> 30:39.170
Which one of these broads
is the big sergeant I hear so much about?

30:39.254 --> 30:40.713
The one who's in love with my Sally?

30:40.797 --> 30:43.508
A, we don't have no broads working here.

30:43.591 --> 30:46.052
And B, if we did,
they wouldn't be in love with no woman.

30:46.135 --> 30:49.097
No, Sal, my brother. Sal Benaci?

30:49.180 --> 30:50.431
Sal the plumber?

30:50.515 --> 30:51.683
That guy's your brother?

30:51.766 --> 30:52.934
Yeah!

30:53.017 --> 30:55.854
I says to him, "I got a gig
up at the Hill Street Precinct."

30:55.937 --> 30:57.772
He says, "Look up this big sergeant.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.357
The chick loves to party." (moans)

31:00.275 --> 31:02.068
Your brother must be
messed up in his thinking

31:02.151 --> 31:03.736
since he got conked on the noggin.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.446
-(laughs)
-Here, hold this yourself.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.907
-Return it to the desk upstairs.
-Yeah.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.243
You would be immune in the entire matter

31:10.326 --> 31:12.453
involving
possible judge fixing and bribery.

31:12.537 --> 31:16.207
In return, you would give us
testimonial and evidentiary cooperation.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.627
(chuckles)
You people are still insulting me.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.171
I said I knew nothing about bribes.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.590
I made deliveries!

31:23.673 --> 31:26.968
You don't have to admit anything, Jesus.
All we need is

31:27.051 --> 31:29.429
to have you go to Judge Hardin
and pretend that you knew.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.264
What about the murder charges?

31:31.347 --> 31:34.100
There weren't any murder charges.
You were called in for questioning.

31:34.183 --> 31:37.395
The autopsy report indicates
Attorney Brown died of a heart attack.

31:37.478 --> 31:39.272
What about possible evidence tampering?

31:39.355 --> 31:40.857
-Immune there, too.
-Uh-huh.

31:40.940 --> 31:44.485
Like to have heard to your argument
against tainted confiscation, Irwin.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.529
(chuckles) Uh, no, thank you.

31:46.613 --> 31:47.864
I say no deal.

31:49.365 --> 31:51.159
Now we're all gonna leave now, huh?

31:51.242 --> 31:53.453
We're all gonna go and have a nice laugh.

31:53.536 --> 31:54.829
Nobody's laughing, Jesus.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.498
I want a guarantee
that I can practice law.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.250
You want us to fix the bar exam?

31:59.334 --> 32:03.421
No! I want a guarantee
that I ain't screwed up

32:03.504 --> 32:05.340
with the ethics and credential panel.

32:05.423 --> 32:06.674
-Jesus--
-Jesus nothing!

32:07.967 --> 32:09.636
Otherwise you can forget your wire

32:09.719 --> 32:11.930
and keep your stinking judges on the take.

32:12.388 --> 32:13.973
I think he's got a fair concern there.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.976
We'll make a full presentation
of the facts.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.520
I don't think you'll have
a problem with the ethics panel.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.564
Don't worry about that.
That's been agreed to.

32:24.233 --> 32:26.611
I didn't touch Attorney Brown!

32:28.029 --> 32:31.532
I went there with a tape to get
him to incriminate himself.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.701
We're standing there,
screaming at each other,

32:33.785 --> 32:35.161
and he fell over!

32:35.787 --> 32:38.331
But I knew that you people
wouldn't believe that.

32:38.414 --> 32:40.667
Jesus, the tape is not an issue.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.085
It is to me!

32:43.962 --> 32:45.922
It is to me.

32:47.423 --> 32:50.218
I know what you're saying,

32:50.301 --> 32:53.429
"Poor, dumb Martinez tried
to change the tape around."

32:56.432 --> 32:58.893
What other choice did I have, Frankie?

33:01.354 --> 33:02.772
You put me in jail.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.607
You bust me at my job.

33:04.691 --> 33:07.527
You don't believe me from word one!

33:12.615 --> 33:14.617
All right, point taken.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.379
What do you want me to say?

33:27.588 --> 33:29.924
(traffic noises)

33:33.720 --> 33:34.804
I talked to him.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.055
Is he gonna back off?

33:36.139 --> 33:38.266
(exhales) No.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.561
-That crazy creep.
-Tommy, you got to understand,

33:41.644 --> 33:44.022
a guy like this,
his reputation means everything to him.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.773
But they didn't get us for anything.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.817
They questioned
disposition of the evidence.

33:47.900 --> 33:52.321
-For Vince, that's like being convicted.
-Okay, I get it.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.699
Listen to me.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.951
For whatever reason,
the night that this happened,

33:57.035 --> 33:58.202
Vince didn't turn you in.

33:58.911 --> 34:01.748
Now he says anything
about seeing what you did back then

34:01.831 --> 34:04.250
is as much trouble for him
as it is for you. You understand?

34:04.333 --> 34:06.461
That's why he's trying
to make a separate case.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.171
Guy's running all around.

34:10.298 --> 34:11.966
Thanks for finding out for me, Guid.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.885
Tommy, you hear what I'm saying?

34:13.968 --> 34:15.762
I think you're gonna be okay here.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.473
You just got to do your job
and keep your nose clean.

34:19.182 --> 34:20.933
That's right. That's how I got to do it.

34:22.101 --> 34:25.938
Hey, look, I got to get back there.
Take care of yourself.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.070
Yeah, you too.

34:32.779 --> 34:37.200
All right, there's your driver's license,
there's your pay stub,

34:37.283 --> 34:39.786
and here are two new Andrew Jacksons,

34:39.869 --> 34:41.913
and I'm gonna see you on Friday, right?

34:41.996 --> 34:44.082
And you, get the hell out of here.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.250
Let's talk.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.142
Go on.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.143
Come on.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.021
Forget about that thumb stuff, all right?

35:07.105 --> 35:09.357
Uh, my Irish temper.

35:11.359 --> 35:12.401
I'm listening.

35:13.694 --> 35:14.987
What I'm worried about here,

35:15.863 --> 35:17.365
we're gonna saturate the market.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.991
That's no good for nobody.

35:20.409 --> 35:23.037
Now, I got no particular love
for this neighborhood.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.082
Be my guest.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.752
All I want is a piece of your big.

35:30.419 --> 35:32.755
You want a piece
of the interest I collect.

35:34.006 --> 35:34.966
How about it?

35:36.551 --> 35:38.636
No chance.

35:38.719 --> 35:40.888
(chuckles)
Come on. I want to show you something.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.565
(door slam)

35:56.112 --> 35:58.281
We tried to make it easy for you, shorty.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.491
You're gonna try and hurt me now?

36:01.868 --> 36:03.035
Looks that way.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.079
You too?

36:06.622 --> 36:08.332
Ah, come on, say it.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.501
Yes.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.129
Thank you.
I just wanted to get that on tape.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.046
Ahh!

36:14.130 --> 36:15.131
-(screams)
-(sizzles)

36:15.214 --> 36:16.966
-(grunts)
-(thud)

36:17.049 --> 36:18.342
(grunting)

36:18.926 --> 36:21.679
I'm a cop, ptomaine breath!

36:21.762 --> 36:23.598
You jerks are busted!

36:30.229 --> 36:31.814
HARDIN:
I don't have to hear this, young man.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.232
Well, you better hear it, bro.

36:34.066 --> 36:36.652
Because I'm getting sick
of waiting around.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.905
I'm coming in, and I'm naming you,

36:38.988 --> 36:41.490
and I'm gonna name
every hooker who paid you.

36:41.574 --> 36:44.785
And I'm gonna put in the nails
on that <i>maricón, </i>Trousdale.

36:44.869 --> 36:45.745
You're ridiculous.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.788
I ain't ridiculous!

36:47.872 --> 36:49.916
I'm just tired of waiting around

36:49.999 --> 36:51.876
for you to do the right thing, bro.

36:53.461 --> 36:54.378
What do you want?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.214
JESUS: <i>I need a vacation.</i>

36:57.423 --> 36:59.342
HARDIN:
<i>I'm gonna give you a check for $3,000.</i>

36:59.425 --> 37:02.637
That's just once, you understand me?
Not $3,000 this year, $5,000 next.

37:02.720 --> 37:06.182
Well, you know, I got a lot
to keep quiet about, Your Honor.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.601
With your own bailiff getting
busted for bribe taking,

37:08.684 --> 37:11.812
-it must be pretty hard around here.
-Hey, Trousdale's taken care of.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.815
<i>Now if we all sit tight for a month,</i>
<i>this whole thing blows away.</i>

37:14.899 --> 37:15.733
That ought to do it.

37:15.816 --> 37:18.236
Well, then you better make it $5,000.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.197
The rent in San Juan
is getting high, you know.

37:21.739 --> 37:22.865
Hey, who's--

37:22.949 --> 37:24.617
You're under arrest, Judge.

37:24.700 --> 37:27.203
Ah, come on, Judge.
That's just weird, man.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.377
-The charges?
-Bribery.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.712
(telephone ringing)

37:36.796 --> 37:38.339
Lieutenant Howard.

37:38.422 --> 37:39.465
Jaga.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.884
Where is Prunella?

37:41.968 --> 37:45.054
Oh, not here. She wants
your reunion meeting to be this evening.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.681
I'll make my apartment available.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.517
Ah. Prunella said so in her letters.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.018
You're a generous man.

37:51.769 --> 37:55.439
Prunella has told me
she also explained in her letter

37:55.523 --> 37:58.276
that she didn't consider
herself married to you.

37:59.026 --> 38:02.613
And about her friendship with me?

38:02.697 --> 38:06.200
Yeah, women change like moon.

38:07.451 --> 38:11.789
I will pay you the full matchmaker's fee
for bringing us back together, Howard.

38:11.872 --> 38:14.000
And many gifts. Do you like monkeys?

38:14.500 --> 38:16.794
(laughs) I don't need anything, Jaga.

38:16.877 --> 38:20.339
I don't think
you should get your hopes up.

38:20.423 --> 38:24.802
My friend, my stars are all aligned.

38:24.885 --> 38:28.097
I will go to her like a lion, to roar.

38:28.973 --> 38:32.310
Oh! You have restored my happiness.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.189
-Sergeant Jablonski?
-What?

38:38.816 --> 38:40.026
Miss Dolan.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.528
I didn't think you'd remember.

38:42.611 --> 38:46.699
Well, you were a very memorable
khaki officer, Miss Dolan.

38:46.782 --> 38:49.452
I just wanted to let you know
that I just passed my civil service,

38:49.535 --> 38:50.453
I'm legitimate now.

38:50.536 --> 38:52.747
Hey, that's very good!

38:52.830 --> 38:54.040
Better late than never, huh?

38:54.123 --> 38:57.793
You show real stick-to-itiveness,
Ms. Dolan.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.670
You ought to be real proud of yourself.

39:00.629 --> 39:02.465
Hey, look who's here.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.050
Lieutenant Buntz.

39:06.093 --> 39:08.596
Maureen just passed
her khaki certification, Lieutenant.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.139
No kidding?

39:10.222 --> 39:12.725
Do you have a minute
for me, Lieutenant Buntz?

39:13.351 --> 39:15.853
For you, Miss Dolan? Sure, anytime.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.528
So, uh, second time's lucky, huh?

39:24.612 --> 39:26.489
I graduated fourth in my class.

39:26.572 --> 39:27.865
Fourth? Wow.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.992
Uh, what can I do for you?

39:31.702 --> 39:33.412
Would you have dinner with me some night?

39:35.456 --> 39:36.707
Not for anything, Miss Dolan.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.168
Oh, please, call me Maureen.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.629
(sighs) Yeah, well, uh,

39:41.712 --> 39:43.923
if I'm not mistaken, Maureen,

39:44.006 --> 39:45.758
last time you and me conversed,

39:45.841 --> 39:48.469
I had the impression that you thought
I was a scum bucket.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.264
Well, I know that you thought that.

39:52.348 --> 39:54.725
I know that's the impression
I gave, but I didn't mean it.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.395
I mean, I did mean it, but...

39:58.729 --> 39:59.772
look...

40:02.441 --> 40:03.734
are you busy tonight?

40:09.115 --> 40:11.867
Judge Garvey Hardin,
resisting arrest, bribery-taking.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.036
All those charges are complete frippery.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.705
Never in my 17 years as a jurist

40:16.789 --> 40:19.959
have I seen such a scandalous example
of police misconduct.

40:20.042 --> 40:22.420
Hey. You want to shut up a minute, Judge?

40:22.503 --> 40:24.046
That was a good shift.

40:24.130 --> 40:27.091
Yeah, tell you the truth,
I was surprised they put us together.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.385
I do a couple tours
with all the new assignees.

40:29.468 --> 40:32.596
Still, two female officers,
they ever do that permanent?

40:32.680 --> 40:34.223
Not up here.

40:34.306 --> 40:35.766
Need a ride home or anything?

40:35.850 --> 40:37.435
Ladies.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.477
Can I help you?

40:38.561 --> 40:40.896
No, taking care of one member
of this family's plenty.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.024
I'm Vito Benaci, Sal's big brother.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.651
-Vito Benaci.
-Kathryn McBride.

40:45.734 --> 40:46.861
How are you?

40:47.903 --> 40:49.113
He said you was a pistol.

40:49.196 --> 40:50.448
He did? (chuckles)

40:50.531 --> 40:53.659
Is she good, or what? She's in love
with him, but nobody's supposed to know.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.161
Wait a second, Sal the plumber!

40:55.244 --> 40:57.538
Right! Is she good or what?

40:57.621 --> 41:01.167
Listen, you guys want to double with me
and my brother or what?

41:01.250 --> 41:02.877
Uh, Vito?

41:02.960 --> 41:04.170
Right, Vito.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.130
Vito, when I go out with Sal,

41:06.213 --> 41:07.673
she would love to go out with you.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.551
All right for the Benaci brothers.

41:10.634 --> 41:11.510
Yeah!

41:12.928 --> 41:15.055
Be sure to mark your calendar book for...

41:15.139 --> 41:17.558
-2046 maybe.
-(laughs)

41:19.226 --> 41:20.895
(doorbell rings)

41:23.439 --> 41:25.191
I appreciate you seeing me, Lieutenant.

41:29.904 --> 41:33.866
You really succeeded in making me
and my tenants enemies, Mr. Styles.

41:33.949 --> 41:35.034
Oh, sorry to hear that.

41:35.117 --> 41:38.329
They all want me to cash their leases out
like you're doing with your tenants.

41:40.247 --> 41:42.917
Well, I think I might have a way
of solving your problem.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.422
I didn't have a problem
till this afternoon.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.508
Well, I've got a proposition for you.

41:50.591 --> 41:52.051
How about I buy you out?

41:52.134 --> 41:54.261
You paid $62,800 at that auction?

41:56.931 --> 41:59.058
130 grand be more than double your money.

41:59.558 --> 42:02.311
Those people are gonna blow
that seven months' rent you give them.

42:02.394 --> 42:05.064
They're gonna spend it all,
they're not gonna have any place to stay.

42:05.147 --> 42:08.234
Oh, come on now. What are you,
the <i>massa</i> of the plantation, Lieutenant?

42:08.817 --> 42:10.819
Worried about how the darkies
are gonna spend their wages?

42:10.903 --> 42:11.862
Don't twist my words.

42:11.946 --> 42:13.697
I thought we were talking about you.

42:17.701 --> 42:18.994
$130,000 cash?

42:20.454 --> 42:22.831
It's the only way
Lionel Styles does business.

42:22.915 --> 42:25.000
(indistinct chatter)

42:26.293 --> 42:29.380
(jazz music playing on stereo)

42:33.551 --> 42:34.718
Hey, look at this.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.220
Old habits die hard.

42:36.303 --> 42:37.263
Hey, Tommy.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.390
-How you doing, Mary?
-Hi, Guido.

42:39.473 --> 42:42.893
This is Maureen Dolan.
Tom Donahue, Mary Franken.

42:42.977 --> 42:45.062
How you doing?
What, is he trying to impress you?

42:46.647 --> 42:49.358
Tommy and I used to close
this place up pretty regularly.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.317
Is that right?

42:50.401 --> 42:52.152
MAN: Detective Donahue?

42:52.236 --> 42:53.153
Telephone.

42:53.237 --> 42:55.281
Yeah. Be right back.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.707
Well, we're gonna get a bite to eat here.

43:04.790 --> 43:06.417
-It was good seeing you.
-You too.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.459
Take care of him.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.211
Yeah, as much as he'll let me.

43:10.254 --> 43:11.338
Hey, you want to sit down?

43:14.383 --> 43:16.552
(clears throat)
Me and him used to partner.

43:18.929 --> 43:20.306
This is a nice place.

43:20.889 --> 43:21.932
For a dump.

43:23.851 --> 43:25.728
(sighs) So...

43:25.811 --> 43:28.689
So, come on, Dolan. How come
the sudden change of temperature?

43:28.772 --> 43:29.898
Something like that.

43:31.942 --> 43:33.736
I've had you on my mind ever since I quit.

43:35.738 --> 43:37.698
I was halfway
through my certification course

43:37.781 --> 43:39.033
when I realized it.

43:40.659 --> 43:42.703
I just keep imagining being back at work,

43:42.786 --> 43:44.455
having my job back,

43:44.538 --> 43:46.206
and I was always talking to you.

43:47.374 --> 43:49.668
-You weren't hollering at me?
-No.

43:49.752 --> 43:52.630
You stepped on my onions
pretty good last time we talked.

43:52.713 --> 43:55.174
I wasn't hollering
when I was thinking about us.

43:55.257 --> 43:57.509
Couple times, we weren't talking at all.

44:01.221 --> 44:02.264
See ya, Guid.

44:03.557 --> 44:04.433
Uh, what's up?

44:05.017 --> 44:06.769
WAITRESS: Want to start with some drinks?

44:07.853 --> 44:09.104
Uh?

44:11.690 --> 44:12.691
Yeah.

44:15.235 --> 44:18.489
My heart overflows with gratitude, Howard,

44:18.572 --> 44:21.742
that you would grant me
20 minutes with Prunella.

44:21.825 --> 44:23.619
Not at all, Jaga.

44:23.702 --> 44:25.454
There is a clock on the mantel.

44:25.537 --> 44:28.332
Oh, I will certainly observe it carefully.

44:29.875 --> 44:32.878
I see that you're well aware
of Prunella's love of hats.

44:32.961 --> 44:35.923
This? Oh, no, no, my friend.

44:36.006 --> 44:38.842
This is the wedding helmet
of the Bemar Besar,

44:38.926 --> 44:40.511
symbolizing that in marriage

44:40.594 --> 44:43.013
there are two bodies but only one mind.

44:44.056 --> 44:45.182
Very colorful.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.726
Ooh, very strong magic.

44:50.562 --> 44:52.731
Be sure and push that buzzer hard.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.566
It sometime sticks.

44:54.650 --> 44:58.445
My love will have the strength of ten!

44:58.529 --> 45:03.534
And I hope she has an active pelvis. Hmm.

45:10.916 --> 45:12.543
Tell the truth, Furillo.

45:12.626 --> 45:14.670
You really don't think
your people tailed me

45:14.753 --> 45:16.255
to find Jesus?

45:16.338 --> 45:19.049
I wouldn't think J.D.
had that kind of initiative.

45:19.550 --> 45:20.467
Hmph.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.263
You tell the truth.

45:26.348 --> 45:28.308
Do you think all those months
Jesus didn't know

45:28.392 --> 45:31.437
what was in those envelopes
he was delivering for lawyer Brown?

45:32.771 --> 45:34.565
What do you think was in Jesus' mind

45:34.648 --> 45:37.818
the day Brown first offered him
a job as a paralegal?

45:38.402 --> 45:39.903
Imagine how lucky he must have felt.

45:39.987 --> 45:42.573
Especially considering
he falsified his transcripts

45:42.656 --> 45:44.324
in order to get into law school.

45:45.784 --> 45:47.077
A kid you would have laid odds

45:47.161 --> 45:50.622
would be dead in the street
by the time he was 20,

45:50.706 --> 45:53.125
man gives him a chance at a real career.

45:55.043 --> 45:56.378
If I were Jesus,

45:57.504 --> 46:00.883
I would have made it my business
not to know what was in those envelopes.

46:01.508 --> 46:04.720
I would have thought Harold Brown a saint.

46:06.180 --> 46:07.055
(sighs)

46:07.139 --> 46:09.725
And I would be lighting a candle tonight

46:09.808 --> 46:12.853
for the cops
who couldn't carry out a legal search.

46:17.274 --> 46:19.067
All a part of the service.

46:19.151 --> 46:20.527
Hmm.

46:20.611 --> 46:21.945
(laughs)

46:28.994 --> 46:32.289
That's two extra minutes,
my Melanesian friend.

46:33.540 --> 46:36.710
Time you, faced up to reality.

46:37.795 --> 46:41.089
(melancholic music playing)

46:55.729 --> 46:59.316
(siren wails)

46:59.399 --> 47:02.820
(indistinct chatter)

47:06.573 --> 47:07.533
Who got it?

47:07.616 --> 47:10.118
Detective Delaberto.
Somebody gut-shot him.

47:11.036 --> 47:11.912
(sighs)

47:11.995 --> 47:13.455
No assistance call?

47:13.539 --> 47:14.915
He didn't call for anything.

47:14.998 --> 47:16.208
We just found him here.

47:16.291 --> 47:17.543
Maybe he knew the guy.

47:21.755 --> 47:24.049
Oh, no, no!

47:25.050 --> 47:26.844
Oh, my God!

47:26.927 --> 47:28.345
(exhales)

47:35.477 --> 47:37.896
(sighs) I'm gonna have to take you home.
Where do you live?

47:38.730 --> 47:40.357
Delaware and Amherst. What happened?

47:41.400 --> 47:42.234
Guy got killed.

47:44.236 --> 47:45.153
Did you know him?

47:47.239 --> 47:49.575
I know who got him, too. (starts engine)

47:51.952 --> 47:53.620
(engine revs)

47:54.788 --> 47:59.126
(indistinct conversations over radio)

48:02.170 --> 48:04.172
(theme music plays)
