00:02.335 --> 00:04.504
<i>I've heard a lot of stories
about when the world fell.</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:07.424
<i>There were more dead
than the living,</i>

00:07.424 --> 00:09.843
<i>and it started to look like
the world would go cold.</i>

00:10.844 --> 00:14.222
<i>It felt like it was almost there. Almost.</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:20.645
<i>Some people survived
by connecting with each other.</i>

00:22.605 --> 00:24.065
<i>Making found families.</i>

00:27.235 --> 00:31.114
<i>Others gave in to the darkness.</i>

00:35.201 --> 00:40.290
<i>That was a long time ago.
And it's now. Will it be tomorrow?</i>

00:52.302 --> 00:54.471
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:04.064 --> 01:08.777
Fan out. Check every window,
doorway, stairway and hallway.

01:10.028 --> 01:13.073
- This ends here.
- How many you think they got?

01:13.323 --> 01:15.992
Don't matter.
Gonna take them out one by one.

01:29.547 --> 01:30.590
Look who we found.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.845
- Where's Hershel?
- He's with Elijah and the others.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.473
- He's hidden and safe.
- He's good, Maggie.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.893
We're here to take out
shithead and the dickless brigade.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.979
Like I've been saying, we should
go back to the Commonwealth first.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.315
Get our people out
and then deal with Hornsby together.

01:47.315 --> 01:50.693
No, Gabe, he probably
already radioed back. You know that.

01:51.486 --> 01:54.823
Look, he knows us. We're never
getting through those checkpoints.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.325
And if he has his people go after
our families in the meantime?

01:57.325 --> 02:00.578
Carol's there.
So is Rosita and Jerry, Ezekiel.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.956
- We have hope they can handle it.
- Hope is running low.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.958
And the longer we're out here
having these debates,

02:04.958 --> 02:06.668
the more our families back home
are at risk.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.877
Our people are out here too.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.673
We need to find Hornsby and kill him
before he gets to anybody.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.424
Wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.846
We can do all of this.
They've never seen your face before.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.977
Are you saying
I just walk right on in there?

02:24.185 --> 02:26.479
Yeah.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.774
- Me too.
- No, Annie, not you too.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.735
Only one of us needs to go
into the belly of the beast. Hey.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.239
I need you to be safe.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.493
Besides, I am fucked either way.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.289
Hey, you're not gonna
get rid of me that easy, okay?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.417
All right. So what's the play?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.008
Come in.
This is Bravo team.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.885
We need to clear out quadrant four.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.387
- <i>Copy that, Bravo.</i>
- Let's roll.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.188
All right, let's get this over with.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.676
Does anyone have eyes
on that goddamn car?

05:08.349 --> 05:10.810
Fire it up. We need to get
a message to the Commonwealth.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.061
I don't think the signal
is strong enough.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.313
Dial in now.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.695
Calhoun. Calhoun.
Come in. Do you read?

05:22.989 --> 05:26.784
Contingency protocol on Daryl Dixon. Aaron...

05:31.039 --> 05:33.416
All right, go find a goddamn signal
and get a message home.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.711
If that car shows up, make sure
our people are on the wall, ready.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.046
- Yes, sir.
- Shoot to kill.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.898
<i>We have visual on the stolen
vehicle heading westbound.</i>

05:56.898 --> 06:00.902
<i>-Moving to intercept, two minutes.</i>
- Take it down, then find the rest.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.196
<i>If this gets back to Milton
or Mercer, we're eighty-sixed.</i>

06:04.155 --> 06:06.074
We contain this now.

06:07.575 --> 06:08.618
Kill him!

06:52.578 --> 06:55.623
Target westbound.
Keep it steady.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.087
Faster.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.107
Hold on. Target is now northbound.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.244
Keep it steady.
We almost got him.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.084
Try and cut him off up ahead.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.352
We want justice.
Deliver Sebastian now.

07:58.436 --> 08:02.231
We want justice.
Deliver Sebastian now.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.902
We want justice.
Deliver Sebastian now.

08:06.110 --> 08:09.739
We want justice.
Deliver Sebastian now.

08:09.947 --> 08:17.371
We want justice.
Deliver Sebastian now.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.915
We want justice.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.291
<i>Citizens
of the Commonwealth,</i>

08:20.291 --> 08:22.627
<i>this is your governor,
Pamela Milton.</i>

08:22.627 --> 08:24.170
<i>And I want you all to know,</i>

08:24.170 --> 08:26.797
this so-called report
is nothing but lies

08:26.881 --> 08:30.134
meant to sow fear and anger
in people who have suffered enough.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.678
- We want justice.
<i>- But I know my son.</i>

08:33.095 --> 08:36.015
<i>He couldn't have done the horrible
things he's been accused of.</i>

08:37.141 --> 08:38.684
We want justice.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.062
<i>- He is a good young man.</i>
- Deliver Sebastian now.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.355
We want justice.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.066
<i>And the Commonwealth is his home.</i>

08:46.776 --> 08:48.236
Deliver Sebastian now.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.780
<i>He would never do anything
to undermine</i>

08:50.780 --> 08:52.073
<i>the safety and stability...</i>

08:53.282 --> 08:55.284
<i>-...of our great community.</i>

08:56.202 --> 08:59.747
- We want justice.
- This could get ugly.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.458
We need to be ready to help
these people if it goes sideways.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.336
It's only a matter of time
until this gets worse.

09:06.587 --> 09:09.131
- We need options.
- What you mean, leave?

09:09.340 --> 09:12.051
No. I don't wanna leave.
These people need our help.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.970
Nothing gets decided
until everyone's back, okay?

09:16.847 --> 09:17.932
Secure the station.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.476
We want justice.
Deliver Sebastian now.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.353
We want justice.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.939
<i>That calling is an honor
and a privilege.</i>

09:25.189 --> 09:29.652
- He's in there. Bring him out.
- Deliver Sebastian now.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.822
- What are you doing out of uniform?
- Personal day.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.658
Not today. Not with all of this.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.244
This isn't my problem.
It's not yours either.

09:38.244 --> 09:41.330
<i>General Mercer, sir.
You're needed in processing, ASAP.</i>

09:41.414 --> 09:42.665
Not now.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.167
<i>You're gonna want
to see this one, sir.</i>

09:46.210 --> 09:47.461
All right, I'm on my way.

09:50.214 --> 09:54.635
I need you today.
These people do. Now suit up.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.726
We want justice.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.438
Soon I will find the real culprits
and bring them to justice.

10:08.858 --> 10:12.737
Now I will answer some written
questions submitted by citizens.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.035
You think she knows where he is?

10:20.453 --> 10:23.039
No. Probably in hiding.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.541
He's more afraid of her
than he is of them.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.419
Hey, you okay?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.088
-"What are you doing to find him?"
- Yeah.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.675
We are following multiple leads
and will not stop...

10:35.009 --> 10:36.385
I wanna keep going.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.347
Then we will.

10:39.972 --> 10:43.225
We are working diligently
to find the people responsible for

10:43.309 --> 10:47.480
spreading these lies. Rest assured,
they will be brought to justice.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.124
Do you know me?

11:09.168 --> 11:11.545
Yeah, word gets around
the wasteland.

11:11.879 --> 11:12.922
So, no?

11:14.882 --> 11:16.133
A friend told me about you.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.262
Said that I should ask for you
when I came looking for her.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.684
April.
When I came looking for April.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.071
Do you know what happened to her?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.246
I think you asking me that
means that it can't be good.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.293
Why are you really here?

11:54.338 --> 11:55.589
I ran into some trouble.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.719
Some shirt-and-tie-wearing shit

11:59.844 --> 12:03.097
and his clamshell assholes
he runs with.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.268
Get him some water.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.479
Now.

12:16.944 --> 12:21.532
- All right. Who sent you?
- I think you know who sent me.

12:22.783 --> 12:23.826
Daryl.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.330
So, listen. So, this Hornsby prick?

12:28.789 --> 12:31.792
He's been cutting us up out there,
and we're dealing with it.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.046
But, see, the problem is that we
got people in here to protect too.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.675
That's my job.

12:40.926 --> 12:45.765
- And yet I was sent here anyway.
- I can't just let you in.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.728
- We got rules here.
- Rules. Right.

12:51.145 --> 12:55.816
Well, if no else is playing
by those rules, then why are you?

13:10.581 --> 13:11.957
- Aunt Carol?
- Hmm?

13:12.041 --> 13:13.709
The blueberry pancakes are burning.

13:14.668 --> 13:18.923
Oh. Oh, no.
You don't like them burned?

13:19.381 --> 13:22.301
Not really.
You're missing out.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.438
- Kelly took these? What for?
- Mm-hmm.

13:35.981 --> 13:40.194
So we can learn about this place.
Keep an eye on things.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.072
When are Uncle Aaron
and Uncle Daryl coming back?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.366
What,
you like their cooking better?

13:45.991 --> 13:48.410
No way.
Unless there's a campfire,

13:48.494 --> 13:50.204
Daryl has no idea what he's doing.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.207
My dad's a good cook wherever he is.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.876
They'll be back soon.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.480
- What is it?
- Maybe nothing.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.485
All right. You guys get up.
We got to move.

14:23.487 --> 14:24.905
But breakfast...

14:24.989 --> 14:28.242
No, we'll come back later. Right now
we got to play the quiet game.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.647
It's empty. Are you sure
he didn't say anything else?

14:58.772 --> 15:00.941
Dixon was the only name
that came through.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.365
Let's check the school.

16:18.268 --> 16:22.481
Dude. What the hell?
What are you doing here, man?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.443
Well, I'm here to save your asses.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.948
Where is Carol?

16:42.793 --> 16:43.836
Okay.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.346
Charlie Whiskey Actual.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.807
Charlie Whiskey Actual,
this is field unit Bravo.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.813
Charlie Whiskey Actual.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.607
Charlie Whiskey Actual,
this is field unit Bravo.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.823
<i>Copy. This is Actual. Go ahead.</i>

17:13.032 --> 17:15.909
Actual, this is field unit
Bravo OTB.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.620
Message from Hornsby, as follows...

17:31.341 --> 17:33.802
<i>Field unit, come back.
I didn't get that.</i>

17:42.227 --> 17:44.646
We're just gonna have
a little adventure today.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.820
I need you guys to go back
to the bedroom and wait.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.781
And don't come out until I call. Go.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.827
Carol, it's clear.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.205
Hey. Hey.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.627
Turns out you might have been right.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.671
I probably should've stayed
in the goddamn cabin.

18:11.632 --> 18:15.094
Hornsby tried to scare Maggie
by interrogating Hershel.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.179
So the thought is
that he is somehow gonna try

18:17.179 --> 18:19.223
to use the kids
to draw our people out.

18:20.724 --> 18:21.975
And that's why they came for Daryl.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.477
Uh-huh.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.480
But if Hornsby sent those two,
he's keeping it under the radar.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.733
Which means we might be able
to get ahead of them. And him.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.986
Jerry, do you still have access
to that attic space?

18:33.237 --> 18:35.989
Yes, ma'am. Stocked with supplies,
like you asked.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.575
Keep the kids there,
and get word to the others.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.452
Tell them to be ready
to move on your signal.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.914
- I'll start the chain.
- Ready for what?

18:44.706 --> 18:46.166
I mean, this doesn't seem
like the kind of place

18:46.250 --> 18:49.336
that you can just stroll out
the front gate hand in hand.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.005
That's why me and you are gonna
go try to get some insurance.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.010
There she is. Over there.

19:01.473 --> 19:04.852
Our daughter's dead.
What are you gonna do?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.939
I can't imagine the pain
you've experienced,

19:08.939 --> 19:10.399
and I share your horror.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.734
Though I can't bring
your loved ones back,

19:12.818 --> 19:14.319
I will get to the bottom
of what happened

19:14.403 --> 19:15.863
and who was responsible.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.782
We know who did this. He did this.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.578
- Where are you hiding your son?
- What you read was not the truth.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.289
- You know where he is.
- All right. That's enough.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.249
Get back. Now.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.918
Or what? You gonna disappear us too?

19:30.002 --> 19:34.715
- Hey. We hear you. We do.
- Calm down.

19:34.715 --> 19:38.051
To make it here, after everything,
and then lose loved ones this way?

19:38.135 --> 19:41.722
It's unthinkable.
We will find out what happened.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.392
And we will update you
on every step of the investigation

19:45.392 --> 19:47.060
throughout the whole process, okay?

19:48.061 --> 19:50.105
Come on. Everybody out.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.690
- You heard him. Move along.
- Let's go.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.816
Move it.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.652
You, move along.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.072
I am tired of the lies.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.908
Everyone's blood
is on your hands.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.410
Clear the area.
We are not gonna go anywhere.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.620
Come on.
We want...

20:04.620 --> 20:06.330
Move it along.
All right, that's good.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.916
Your friend, Connie, the journalist.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.418
You don't suppose
she would have an idea

20:11.418 --> 20:13.003
who wrote that piece, do you?

20:13.337 --> 20:14.796
It would surprise me if she did.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.728
Down with the Miltons.
Down with the Miltons.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.480
- Down with the Miltons.
- There she is.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.232
- Down with the Miltons.
- Stand back.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.157
Down with the Miltons.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.409
- Down with the Miltons.
- Move.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.912
Down with the Miltons.
Down with the Miltons.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.664
Where's Sebastian?

20:52.417 --> 20:54.962
MAN 2: We want Sebastian.
Pamela, where is he?

21:02.636 --> 21:03.887
B14.

21:05.472 --> 21:06.723
Do it right away.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.439
What do you mean, Pamela knows?

21:14.523 --> 21:18.694
Well, suspects, you know, at least,
who's behind the article.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.863
- But she doesn't have any proof.
- Not yet.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.574
Have you told Connie?

21:25.659 --> 21:27.119
I really wanted
to talk to you first.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.413
But you know what she's like.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.164
She's never gonna run away
from a fight.

21:32.207 --> 21:35.002
- You think I will?
- Please.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.714
From the beginning, you've seen
this place for what it is.

21:40.299 --> 21:44.219
You've never stood for bullshit.
It's one of your better qualities.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.098
But you know more than anyone,

21:48.557 --> 21:51.226
we've made it through a lot
by knowing when it's good to go.

21:52.894 --> 21:56.315
And if things go bad here, I want
a strong exit plan for you guys.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.358
"You guys"?

21:59.943 --> 22:01.778
Come on, Magna.
You know I can't leave Tomi.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.990
We don't go anywhere without you.
End of story.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.451
- No, Magna. That's not...
- Miko.

22:09.411 --> 22:13.081
If the time comes to go,
then we're all going,

22:13.832 --> 22:16.460
even if I have to drag
you and Tomi along.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.922
Until then, we keep our eyes peeled,
help everyone we can,

22:21.256 --> 22:23.091
and wait for the other shoe to drop.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.346
You're so stubborn.

22:31.058 --> 22:35.979
Not one of my better qualities.
But you never seemed to mind.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.318
<i>Lockdown procedures initiated.</i>

22:41.610 --> 22:45.238
<i>Proceed to your residences.
Follow all instructions.</i>

22:45.447 --> 22:48.158
<i>Remain inside until further notice.</i>

22:51.995 --> 22:53.705
- This might be the other shoe.
<i>- Lockdown procedures initiated.</i>

22:53.789 --> 22:55.999
- Come on.
<i>- Proceed to your residences.</i>

22:56.291 --> 22:58.085
<i>Follow all instructions.</i>

23:25.445 --> 23:26.488
Deliver Sebastian now.

23:27.155 --> 23:30.450
We want justice.
Deliver Sebastian now.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.957
A swarm has been detected
five miles out.

23:38.041 --> 23:41.962
Lockdown has been instituted
by order of Governor Pamela Milton.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.548
Return to your homes immediately.

23:45.298 --> 23:48.009
After curfew,
anyone found on the streets

23:48.093 --> 23:50.053
will be arrested
for their own safety.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.179
Clear the area.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.098
I repeat, a swarm
has been detected five miles out.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.599
- Clear out, everyone.
- All right. Okay.

23:55.183 --> 23:57.310
Our brave Commonwealth Army
will be intercepting it...

23:57.436 --> 23:58.478
Come on. Let's go.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.897
- ...before it reaches our gates.
- You heard him. Let's go.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.608
Support their efforts. Go home.
Stay safe.

24:03.692 --> 24:04.734
- Stay there until further notice.
- You can't stay here.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.903
People are dying.
People are dying.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.575
I repeat,

24:11.783 --> 24:15.954
lockdown has been instituted
by order of Governor Pamela Milton.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.541
Take it easy.
There are kids here.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.042
A little help? We got a tail

24:25.672 --> 24:27.632
Keep up with me, okay?
We're gonna need to motor.

24:27.716 --> 24:28.842
Come on. Come on.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.638
Get out of the way.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.107
<i>Return to your homes.</i>

24:44.816 --> 24:47.152
<i>After curfew,
anyone found on the streets</i>

24:47.444 --> 24:49.613
<i>will be arrested
for their own safety.</i>

24:49.863 --> 24:52.866
All right.
What are we looking for exactly?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.368
Uh... Blueprints, schematics.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.455
Plans for Union Station
have to be here somewhere.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.832
Uh-huh. And what else?

25:03.251 --> 25:06.046
The person that I'm looking for
was in the building

25:06.046 --> 25:07.839
right before people
started calling for his head.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.424
So he may have stayed.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.260
So if he stayed
and everybody was looking for him,

25:12.802 --> 25:15.680
then he has
one hell of a hiding spot.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.182
Yeah.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.357
Hey, did I tell you I got married?

25:28.443 --> 25:29.528
Mm.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.112
Why are you telling me this now?

25:33.198 --> 25:36.201
Well, I don't know. Because...

25:37.994 --> 25:39.871
Because she is out there

25:41.706 --> 25:43.416
and she is carrying our child.

25:53.593 --> 25:54.636
It's gonna be okay.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.600
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:15.323 --> 26:16.658
MAN 1: Go right.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.494
MAN 2: Copy. Move right.

26:41.641 --> 26:42.684
MAN 3: Check up ahead.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.730
- Where are the others?
- They'll be here.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.901
Daryl, what you did back there...

26:55.155 --> 26:56.906
I know that
Leah meant something to you.

26:59.784 --> 27:00.827
I'm sorry.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.498
Glenn would've wanted me
to look after you.

27:08.835 --> 27:11.463
You don't have to ever say sorry.
Not to me.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.969
Hey. Hey. Anything?

27:19.387 --> 27:21.473
He's dug in up ahead
with half his men.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.099
We wouldn't get close.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.268
The others are flanking us
from behind.

27:26.645 --> 27:27.937
We should go east
before they pin us in.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.023
Is there any way to get behind them?

27:30.607 --> 27:32.150
Not without them spotting us.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.403
Unless they never see us coming.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.878
Come on. Come on, buddy.

27:53.963 --> 27:56.966
Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.643
Go, go, go. Go, go.

28:51.688 --> 28:54.315
Hello there. Small favor, please.

28:56.776 --> 28:57.861
Coming out now.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.197
Last call before we head out.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.199
You made it.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.410
I heard walkers needed killing.
I couldn't resist.

29:08.955 --> 29:11.124
<i>Swarm has passed
the second checkpoint.</i>

29:11.583 --> 29:14.252
<i>- We need support.</i>
- Hold your position. On our way.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.503
Moving out.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.826
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:47.577 --> 29:50.914
- Just... You know.
- Yeah, I do.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.626
- You want to take a minute?
- No. We should keep going.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.834
If we keep going that way,
we should come up right behind them.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.509
Maybe we can get them
to come down here to us.

31:02.402 --> 31:05.196
I hate to say it, but we are
running out of places to look.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.369
Let me have a look at that.

31:23.798 --> 31:24.883
Huh.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.968
- What?
- Should be a door here.

32:03.671 --> 32:04.714
Jesus.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.350
What the hell?

32:18.603 --> 32:19.896
How'd you guys get in here?

32:23.107 --> 32:25.318
Easy, champ.
Get them off me.

32:27.528 --> 32:28.696
What do we have here?

32:30.990 --> 32:34.786
- Do you know who I am?
- Oh. Do you know who I am?

32:38.498 --> 32:39.791
What do you assholes want?

32:41.918 --> 32:45.546
Get up. We're taking you
home to your mother.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.715
I'm not going anywhere
until this thing blows over.

32:49.759 --> 32:54.514
- My mother doesn't care anyway.
- Yes, she does. You're her kid.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.849
The Commonwealth is her kid.
I'm just a problem.

32:57.892 --> 32:59.018
Oh.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.269
Oh, my God.

33:01.062 --> 33:05.108
Hey, Junior, when you're pissing in
jars and everybody wants you dead,

33:05.483 --> 33:08.611
call me nuts, but I think maybe
it's time to rethink your options.

33:09.112 --> 33:12.073
Now, this one here,
well, she's a goddamn magician.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.742
I have seen her pull little bunnies
right out of her ass

33:14.826 --> 33:16.911
with my very own two eyes.

33:17.787 --> 33:22.041
So if, for whatever reason,
she is throwing you a life raft,

33:22.917 --> 33:25.128
well, then I recommend
you jump in that sucker

33:25.128 --> 33:26.838
and save yourself from drowning.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.261
You really think you can help?

33:52.447 --> 33:56.534
Stop.
You are in violation of curfew.

33:57.118 --> 34:01.581
The swarm is past
the first two outer checkpoints.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.791
Go to your homes immediately.

34:12.091 --> 34:13.593
My daughter can never return home.

34:14.677 --> 34:19.057
And we're not moving until
Sebastian Milton is brought to us.

34:19.807 --> 34:21.350
Yeah. Yeah.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.109
This is Henderson.
We have a situation.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.541
Hey. Hey. I found him.

34:45.625 --> 34:49.337
I found him.
Sebastian's here. He's over here.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.172
You guys go. I'll take care of this.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.257
Ooh. You got the wrong guy.

34:53.424 --> 34:56.677
He's over here. Sebastian's here.
He's getting away.

34:56.803 --> 34:57.845
You are mistaken.

35:01.474 --> 35:04.102
Come on. Let's go.
Let's get him. Don't let him go.

35:04.102 --> 35:08.940
This is your final warning.
Go home. You are not safe here.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.327
Pamela lies. Sebastian kills.

35:21.327 --> 35:24.247
- This is for your own protection.
- Sebastian kills.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.666
Just shut the hell up
and listen for a second.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.435
Fine. Clear them.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.829
<i>They passed
checkpoint three.</i>

36:46.913 --> 36:48.206
Execute, Echo, Delta.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.344
Delta team, keep moving to the west.
Echo is en route.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.970
Espinosa and I
will handle what's left.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.347
What happened
to the outer perimeter?

37:04.347 --> 37:07.683
- How did the walkers get this close?
- Somebody wasn't doing their job.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.103
Seems to happen a lot around here.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.151
About the other week...
That shouldn't have happened.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.320
But I appreciate you having my back.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.989
Yeah. You're trying to do
what you can. I get it.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.952
Yeah.
Shit is upside-down around here.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.499
In this job, I need people like you,
people I can trust.

37:33.876 --> 37:38.256
I can't. I'm sorry. If you need
my help out here, I'm your girl.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.926
But you want my help back there,
that's not for me.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.429
My daughter and my family
will always come first.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.432
I respect that.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.437
If the time comes
and you decide to go

37:53.521 --> 37:56.857
and you need help getting out,
I got you.

37:57.316 --> 38:00.569
<i>This is Delta. Echo is down.
Vehicle overturned.</i>

38:07.326 --> 38:10.705
Watch it. Come on.
Take them out. Take them out.

38:29.849 --> 38:30.891
Go.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.123
Give me your hand.

38:55.499 --> 38:58.085
Help me! No!

39:21.859 --> 39:22.902
TROOPER 2: We got to go, sir.

40:10.491 --> 40:11.617
Would you like one?

40:12.243 --> 40:14.078
It's a little early for me.
Thank you.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.750
You tear-gassed my friends.

40:20.042 --> 40:22.253
If they were there,
they were in defiance of lockdown.

40:23.546 --> 40:24.588
And did it help?

40:25.589 --> 40:28.134
Did it actually make the troopers'
jobs easier outside the walls?

40:29.218 --> 40:30.970
It was about
what could have happened.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.723
It was about safety. It always is.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.852
And you don't care
that it makes you look guilty?

40:37.977 --> 40:40.896
If you have an accusation,
Yumiko, make it.

40:48.279 --> 40:52.324
Look. Can you really sit there
and say there is

40:52.825 --> 40:55.035
no way your son did the things
he was accused of?

40:56.036 --> 40:59.123
He's always been
something of a renegade, it's true.

41:00.249 --> 41:02.251
But his grandfather and uncles
were the same way,

41:02.251 --> 41:03.669
and they mellowed over time.

41:04.628 --> 41:06.046
Became leaders of men.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.383
Maybe he's having his youthful
rebellions later than most,

41:09.467 --> 41:10.676
but he's not a murderer.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.888
Pamela, I am trying to figure out
how much you knew.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.265
It might be my job to defend you.

41:16.265 --> 41:19.393
How can I talk to my lawyer freely
when she's also friends

41:19.477 --> 41:21.312
with the
most prominent journalist around?

41:34.533 --> 41:35.576
Mom, I...

41:47.213 --> 41:49.715
You've humiliated me and yourself.

41:52.134 --> 41:53.552
I told you
I shouldn't have come here.

41:53.844 --> 41:57.806
Look at me. What did you
have to do with all of this?

41:57.890 --> 41:58.933
Nothing, Mom.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.102
Look. That story is a lie.

42:02.728 --> 42:05.814
People, they want someone
to blame and I'm an easy target.

42:05.898 --> 42:08.734
You'll need to tell me more than
that for me to save your ass.

42:09.818 --> 42:11.111
I think we can help each other.

42:13.447 --> 42:16.033
- And who are you?
- I work for Lance Hornsby.

42:16.492 --> 42:19.203
He's out there hunting my friends
under your flag.

42:19.495 --> 42:20.996
I need your help to stop him.

42:21.247 --> 42:24.166
I don't know anything about this.
And I don't see how it helps me.

42:26.001 --> 42:29.797
If your son didn't do the things
that he's accused of, someone did.

43:14.091 --> 43:15.175
Okay, this ends now.

43:16.969 --> 43:18.012
Drop your weapons.

43:20.014 --> 43:22.349
Guns on the ground.
Guns on the ground.

43:23.100 --> 43:26.854
- Tell them, now.
- TROOPER 2: Weapons down.
