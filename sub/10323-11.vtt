Ever since the Shoney's
burned down,

00:03.204 --> 00:07.775
the Crab Shack was Camden's best
place to have a "welcome home
from prison" party.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.711
But you had to get there early
to claim the pool table.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.582
[ Slurring ]
Hey, Earl. Drinky, drinky.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.517
I made some eggnog.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.124
- [ Gagging ]
- [ Laughing ]

00:23.191 --> 00:25.259
It's not eggnog.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.661
It's just margarita
with a egg in it.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.630
It's awful.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.732
[ Earl Narrating ]
It sure felt good
to be out of prison.

00:31.799 --> 00:35.803
- There was just one problem.
- [ Groans ]

00:35.869 --> 00:38.172
Prison wasn't quite out of me.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.741
My name is Earl.

00:47.848 --> 00:51.719
Hey, Earl. I'm glad you got out
in time for Christmas.
Yeah, me too.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.722
I picked the leader
of the skinheads
as my secret Santa.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.125
And what do you get for the guy
who hates everything?

00:57.191 --> 00:59.260
Oh, Earl.
I meant to tell you this,

00:59.327 --> 01:01.795
but I was unconscious
for the last 15 minutes.

01:01.862 --> 01:05.899
But I got your list back
from the prison
property department.

01:05.966 --> 01:09.270
[ Laughs ]
You may wanna add
"Broke Randy's nose" to it.

01:09.337 --> 01:12.140
Man. It must feel good
to have the list back.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.675
Like Linus getting
his blanket back.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.711
'Course, he's probably
grown up now, with kids
of his own.

01:17.778 --> 01:22.550
Now he's the one going,
"Wah, wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah."

01:23.717 --> 01:27.488
Yeah, yeah. It's, uh--
It's good to see this again.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.857
[ Earl Narrating ]
I said I felt good,
but truth be told,

01:29.923 --> 01:31.859
I wasn't sure how I felt.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.496
You see, it was doing
a good thing for Joy
that got me thrown in prison,

01:35.563 --> 01:39.900
and doing good things in prison
eventually got me thrown
in the hole.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.903
In fact, the only reason
I got out of prison was...

01:42.970 --> 01:46.073
- 'cause I was in the middle
of doin' something bad.
- [ Screams ]

01:46.140 --> 01:49.677
After everything that happened,
karma had me pretty confused.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.280
- What number
you gonna do next, Earl?
- I don't know.

01:52.346 --> 01:55.516
I think, uh, maybe I need
to get settled first.

01:55.583 --> 01:59.187
You know, get my life
back in order.

01:59.253 --> 02:02.790
[ Earl Narrating ] I thought
I'd feel better once I got back
in our old motel room,

02:02.856 --> 02:05.726
but unfortunately the mayor
decided to start
a new Christmas tradition--

02:05.793 --> 02:09.197
hiding the homeless
for the holidays.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.467
Whoa! Check it out.
Gary's white!

02:14.835 --> 02:17.905

Turns out there was only
one room left.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.941
[ Buzzer Sounds ]

02:21.008 --> 02:23.977
To get my life back on track,
I needed a job.
[ Tires Squealing ]

02:24.044 --> 02:27.948
Unfortunately, there was
only one business in town
that would hire ex-cons.

02:28.015 --> 02:31.652
So I was the new delivery guy
for the Camden Foreign Food
Restaurant.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.555
Damn it, Randy, you said
you secured Senor Lo Mein.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.757
You know, for the guy
who gets to wear the costume...

02:36.824 --> 02:39.327
and ring all the doorbells,
you sure are grouchy.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.495

get this over with.

Actually, it's Stan Johansen.
[ Chuckles ]

02:53.241 --> 02:55.909
[ Earl Narrating ]
Ralph's life had taken
a few interesting turns...

02:55.976 --> 02:58.512
since he hopped over
the prison wall six months ago.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.714
He was so desperate
to get away from that prison,

03:00.781 --> 03:04.552
he got in the first car
that would pick up
a man with no pants.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.422
Oh, my God. Hop in.
All right.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.659
And to make you
more comfortable,
I'll take off my shirt.

03:15.829 --> 03:19.667
[ Tires Squealing ]
[ Ralph ]
Stop the car. Stop the car!

03:22.370 --> 03:26.374
You're lucky I can't drive
a stick, or I'd kick your ass
and take your car, pervert.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.312
And if you tell anybody
what we did, I'll kill you!

03:34.948 --> 03:38.118
[ Earl Narrating ]
Ralph was gettin' more and more
desperate as the days wore on.

that you want me to *

Lucky for Ralph,
Doris was one of those widows...

that never threw out
her dead husband's clothes.

but, buddy, you won't believe
what those pills do.

- Oh, yeah, sugarplum.

when there's strange men
in the house.

I was starting to feel
more like life on the outside...

This sucks, Randy.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.948
I'm an ex-con, I'm broke,
I got a crappy job.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.551
That's okay, Earl.
Don't be sad.
We've lived on floors before.

05:50.618 --> 05:54.254
Not after I spent two years
of my life doing good things,
we haven't.

Randy, things
were supposed to be
better than this by now.

and do something on your list.

makes you feel better.

I like it.
It's Christmassy.

Couple years ago,
Randy had stolen...

06:19.012 --> 06:22.583
what he thought was a laser gun
but ended up just being
a laser pointer.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.752
Still fun though.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.488
It's like having
a tiny green hand
I can put wherever I want.

I was sorry so--
No, you didn't.

Well, whatever.
It's implied.
I'm here, aren't I?

06:53.213 --> 06:55.716
Earl, maybe you forgot
in prison,

06:55.783 --> 06:59.286
but usually when you talk
to people on the list,
you use your nice guy voice.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.154
I told you I wasn't
ready for this.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.958
I had a quarter wedged in
this thing for over a year and
can't get the damn thing out.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.295
That sucks. I've had
a candy corn stuck in my ear
since I was nine.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.930
Sometimes it attracts ants.

07:09.997 --> 07:13.867
Okay, life's rough.
Things get stuck places.
We can all agree on that.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.303
Anyway, like I was sayin',
I got this list,
and to cross you off...

07:16.369 --> 07:19.206
I need to do something
to make it up to you,
so what can I do?

I get to pick anything?
Yeah, if you calm down
a little bit.

I'm not gonna let you pick
while you're pissed.

It's like letting you
go grocery shopping hungry.

[ Earl Narrating ]
I didn't want to do
what Mistletoe chose,

07:29.883 --> 07:32.052
but I was trying
to get my life back on track,

07:32.119 --> 07:36.056
and my last hope
was the list.

Why are you smoking?
Quittin' was on your list.

I'm smoking 'cause
some old Texan dude just
offered to buy me a boob job.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.223
It's a little stressful, okay?

08:10.290 --> 08:13.360
If it makes you feel
any better, Mistletoe seems
like she's a lot happier.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.262
I can see a spring
in her step.

by an actual spring.

- Oh, really?

doesn't really exist.

from Carson Daly,
