WEBVTT

00:07.603 --> 00:09.071
<i>Previously on "School Spirits."</i>

00:09.071 --> 00:10.272
We know she's blackmailing
Anderson for grades, right?

00:10.272 --> 00:12.241
When they got that video,
they freaked,

00:12.241 --> 00:14.677
and if Anderson didn't do it--
- Then Claire definitely did.

00:14.677 --> 00:16.178
Pick you up at 7:00 tomorrow.

00:16.178 --> 00:17.980
- You don't want me to drive?
- I want to drive.

00:17.980 --> 00:19.682
Someone took that video, Nicole.

00:19.682 --> 00:20.883
It doesn't matter
who took the video.

00:20.883 --> 00:22.418
You look amazing.

00:22.418 --> 00:23.819
I didn't hurt Maddie.

00:23.819 --> 00:26.288
I don't know what happened
to her, but it wasn't me.

00:26.288 --> 00:28.991
<i>We've traced the object
to a person of interest.</i>

00:30.559 --> 00:32.628
<i>- Who?</i>
- Roger South?

01:08.593 --> 01:11.229
Nicole,
did you even try honking?

01:13.231 --> 01:15.700
You were supposed to give me
a ride this morning.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.669
To school?
Remember?

01:18.669 --> 01:20.271
I had stuff to do. Sorry.

01:20.271 --> 01:22.240
I figured.
You were AWOL all weekend.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.474
Didn't answer a single text.

01:23.474 --> 01:25.309
I had an application
deadline, okay?

01:25.309 --> 01:27.879
So the video statement was due,
my portfolio looks like

01:27.879 --> 01:30.381
it was slapped together
by a third grader, so.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.883
I hear you.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.417
I have an interview
with a Northwestern alum

01:33.417 --> 01:37.555
during my free today,
and my socks don't even match,

01:37.555 --> 01:40.558
but I'm hoping she gets it.

01:40.558 --> 01:43.461
Gets what?

01:43.461 --> 01:44.996
We're all
a little distracted.

01:44.996 --> 01:47.365
Nicole, they found a weapon.

01:47.365 --> 01:49.066
Now they're trying to tell us
that our best friend

01:49.066 --> 01:51.802
was murdered by the janitor
for a sack of cash?

01:51.802 --> 01:53.471
- Yeah.
- Which makes no sense.

01:53.471 --> 01:55.006
Mr. South?

01:55.006 --> 01:57.208
Mr. South
wouldn't even kill an ant.

01:57.208 --> 02:00.211
There's a frickin' army of them
living in the language lab.

02:00.211 --> 02:03.481
I've seen him
leave them wet lollipops.

02:03.481 --> 02:06.584
What's Maddie's mom think?
She think you did it?

02:06.584 --> 02:07.852
Weren't you there
when she found out?

02:07.852 --> 02:09.487
Yeah, but she's upset.

02:09.487 --> 02:11.422
What would you
expect her to be?

02:11.422 --> 02:15.626
Uh, skeptical.

02:15.626 --> 02:16.727
Like the rest of us.

02:27.071 --> 02:28.306
Hmm.

02:31.509 --> 02:34.078
FYI, you're a very impressive
third grader.

02:34.078 --> 02:36.447
I mean, I'm impressed.

02:39.684 --> 02:41.319
Uh--

02:41.319 --> 02:42.553
And a little concerned.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.121
Damn, she knew
you took all these?

02:44.121 --> 02:46.791
I took a bunch of you, too.
You're just not photogenic.

02:46.791 --> 02:50.728
Yeah, but this is intense.

02:50.728 --> 02:52.163
I mean, it's cool.

02:52.163 --> 02:53.497
It's just a lot of Maddie,
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie,

02:53.497 --> 02:54.498
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.

02:54.498 --> 02:56.167
What are you trying to say?

02:59.804 --> 03:01.305
Nothing.

03:01.305 --> 03:03.007
Hey.

03:03.007 --> 03:05.843
Breathe.
Stop doubting yourself, okay?

03:05.843 --> 03:07.945
If admissions asks
why you're obsessed,

03:07.945 --> 03:09.313
say you worshipped her.

03:09.313 --> 03:11.182
Tell 'em she taught you
how to parallel park.

03:14.752 --> 03:16.988
Serving on a jury
is really an honor.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.889
The juries must listen
to both sides

03:18.889 --> 03:21.592
and make an informed decision
based on facts,

03:21.592 --> 03:24.595
not opinions or gossip
overheard in the elevator.

03:24.595 --> 03:27.198
And when our living seniors
perform mock trial,

03:27.198 --> 03:29.567
we get to see justice
in action.

03:29.567 --> 03:34.038
It's powerful, holding someone
else's fate in your hands.

03:34.038 --> 03:36.440
Mock Trial not only
gives us a chance

03:36.440 --> 03:38.442
to shadow the current senior
class participants--

03:38.442 --> 03:40.111
Oh!

03:40.111 --> 03:41.646
Yes?
Charlie, you have a question?

03:41.646 --> 03:43.014
Yeah.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.483
Did you ever do anything
to really piss him off?

03:45.483 --> 03:46.784
Who?

03:46.784 --> 03:47.818
The janitor.

03:47.818 --> 03:49.420
- Never.
- Oh, come on.

03:49.420 --> 03:51.289
Maybe it happened during, like
one of those blackout periods.

03:51.289 --> 03:52.290
Charlie.

03:52.290 --> 03:53.791
Well, no.

03:53.791 --> 03:54.659
I mean, I had to black out,
like, all of eighth grade.

03:54.659 --> 03:55.960
I mean, I really had to.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.261
I didn't grow a single
armpit hair until ninth.

03:57.261 --> 03:58.963
I started to tape
my real head hair to armpit.

03:58.963 --> 04:00.298
It was really bad.

04:00.298 --> 04:01.766
Okay, if we could just focus
on Mock Trial?

04:01.766 --> 04:04.302
Mr. Martin, I'm sorry.
Nobody wants to do this at all.

04:04.302 --> 04:06.337
Not after last year's case.
That was a snoozefest.

04:06.337 --> 04:08.606
Well, then we can
make up our own case

04:08.606 --> 04:10.007
and I ask you fine people questions.

04:10.007 --> 04:11.075
I've got lots of them.

04:11.075 --> 04:12.476
Okay, well, I'm guessing

04:12.476 --> 04:13.544
none of them will help me
unlock a repressed memory,

04:13.544 --> 04:15.046
so I'm outta here.
- Maddie.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.647
I'm not into dead person extracurriculars.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.149
Maddie, sit.

04:18.149 --> 04:21.419
Or being talked to
like a cockapoo.

04:21.419 --> 04:23.821
I'm--

04:23.821 --> 04:27.124
please, please.

04:27.124 --> 04:29.160
Okay, everyone here
feels your pain.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.362
What we don't know
often controls us,

04:31.362 --> 04:32.630
but we have to resist.

04:32.630 --> 04:34.265
- Resist?
- Yes.

04:34.265 --> 04:36.233
An innocent man
may go down for killing me,

04:36.233 --> 04:39.103
and I don't even have
any memories to help him.

04:39.103 --> 04:41.272
I don't even have
another suspect to point to.

04:42.873 --> 04:44.175
I've been here for weeks,

04:44.175 --> 04:45.543
and I still don't know
what happened to me.

04:45.543 --> 04:46.944
Maybe that's the way
it's supposed to be.

04:46.944 --> 04:48.879
Rhonda, can you just stop
piling on?

04:48.879 --> 04:50.648
I'm not piling on, Moose.

04:50.648 --> 04:53.184
Sometimes, our brains
erase trauma to protect us.

04:53.184 --> 04:54.518
Who's gonna protect
Mr. South?

04:54.518 --> 04:56.520
Whether your memory
returns or not,

04:56.520 --> 04:58.622
you're not in a position
to help the accused, Maddie.

04:58.622 --> 05:02.293
We have no influence over
what happens in that world.

05:02.293 --> 05:04.895
Do we?

05:04.895 --> 05:08.699
Do we have any sway
over a living person?

05:12.303 --> 05:15.840
Is there something we're
not sharing with the group?

05:15.840 --> 05:17.375
Uh, speaking
of repressed memories--

05:17.375 --> 05:18.509
We're not.

05:18.509 --> 05:20.444
Well, we can, so I will.

05:20.444 --> 05:22.513
Did a little research
on my own, and it turns out

05:22.513 --> 05:25.750
our library has
a bodacious selection

05:25.750 --> 05:27.218
of psych books.

05:27.218 --> 05:29.220
Who knew, right?
It's crazy. Okay.

05:29.220 --> 05:33.124
In this book, there's a chapter
about how to retrieve memory

05:33.124 --> 05:35.159
through triggers,
like, you know,

05:35.159 --> 05:37.461
taste and smell and touch.

05:37.461 --> 05:38.529
Um--

05:42.133 --> 05:45.669
We're gonna help you get
through this, Maddie. Okay?

05:45.669 --> 05:50.808
We're all gonna figure it out.
- Thank you, Wally.

Okay, close your eyes.

08:55.292 --> 08:56.727
I already know
it's a burrito.

08:56.727 --> 08:58.996
Yeah, but the smell
could be a trigger.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.431
I don't think
I can watch this.

09:00.431 --> 09:01.899
Why?

09:01.899 --> 09:03.634
Last meal?
Hello?

09:03.634 --> 09:05.502
French fries, peanut oil,
throat closing up?

09:05.502 --> 09:07.037
Oh, please.

09:07.037 --> 09:08.706
Anything served here
could kill you.

09:08.706 --> 09:11.008
I once found a press-on nail
in my sloppy joe.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.911
Hey, yo, team. Can we please
just take a time-out?

09:13.911 --> 09:16.113
Let's let Maddie concentrate.

09:16.113 --> 09:18.349
I don't think
the smell's working.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.583
Well, take a bite.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.318
Let the cilantro
work its magic.

09:21.318 --> 09:23.621
Oh, cilantro?
I hate cilantro.

09:23.621 --> 09:25.289
Simon always ordered
my burritos without it.

09:25.289 --> 09:27.858
Simon orders you lunch?
Really?

09:27.858 --> 09:29.326
Well, he's my best friend.

09:29.326 --> 09:31.261
We know what we both hate.
- Take a bite.

09:31.261 --> 09:34.231
Here we go.
Let's see if that's better.

09:36.467 --> 09:38.235
Okay.

09:38.235 --> 09:40.871
Now really think about
that last lunch you had.

09:40.871 --> 09:44.341
What are you seeing right now?

09:44.341 --> 09:46.477
Simon.

09:46.477 --> 09:48.379
He's got salsa on his chin.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.613
- Nice.
- That's actually really cute.

09:49.613 --> 09:52.750
Maybe you shouldn't talk.
Just chew.

09:54.418 --> 09:56.587
Wally,
this is so sweet of you,

09:56.587 --> 09:58.656
but I don't think
this is working.

09:58.656 --> 10:00.791
And honestly, I don't
even think this is chicken.

10:00.791 --> 10:02.026
That's so bad.

10:02.026 --> 10:03.560
Okay, okay,
chuck the mystery meat.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.963
What is the last song
you remember?

10:05.963 --> 10:10.000
- What?
- Song, music?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.569
Transistor radio.

10:12.569 --> 10:14.838
I walked into
the guidance center,

10:14.838 --> 10:16.540
and Mr. Manfredo's secretary

10:16.540 --> 10:21.779
was filing to "He's so Fine"
by The Chiffons.

10:21.779 --> 10:23.714
That's my last song.

10:23.714 --> 10:25.082
What's yours, Pussytoes?

10:32.089 --> 10:33.457
Man, I was up all night

10:33.457 --> 10:35.559
looking at all these files
all over the house.

10:35.559 --> 10:36.560
There's nothing.

10:39.596 --> 10:41.231
Okay.

10:41.231 --> 10:43.267
What you're saying is that

10:43.267 --> 10:45.736
your father has nothing
but that crowbar,

10:45.736 --> 10:47.504
which anyone could've taken
from the school?

10:47.504 --> 10:49.206
No, no.
He doesn't need much more.

10:49.206 --> 10:51.141
Yeah, but he needs to be the
hero who catches the villain.

10:51.141 --> 10:54.244
Mr. South's not a villain.
He's more like an easy target.

10:54.244 --> 10:55.846
Not to mention my alibi.

10:55.846 --> 10:57.614
I mean, if it cleared me,
why can't it clear him?

10:57.614 --> 10:59.650
Wait, how was he your alibi?

10:59.650 --> 11:01.385
He was in the boy's bathroom
all of eighth period

11:01.385 --> 11:03.020
fixing a window
while I was trying

11:03.020 --> 11:04.421
to unlock Maddie's phone.

11:04.421 --> 11:06.223
The whole period?
And you know that for sure?

11:06.223 --> 11:07.624
Yes, yeah.

11:07.624 --> 11:11.228
He wouldn't stop whistling
the theme from "Titanic."

11:11.228 --> 11:13.263
What?
It's a long song.

11:13.263 --> 11:14.531
And your father knows this?

11:14.531 --> 11:16.233
Doesn't matter
what my father knows.

11:16.233 --> 11:18.035
No, when he needs somebody
to kick around,

11:18.035 --> 11:19.203
nobody can stop him.

11:19.203 --> 11:20.804
Trust me.

11:20.804 --> 11:22.639
Been there.

11:22.639 --> 11:24.842
Well, it'd be a lot easier
to save the janitor

11:24.842 --> 11:27.478
if we could focus on who took
the video of me and Anderson.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.779
We need to find out

11:28.779 --> 11:30.080
what other evidence
they have against him.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.582
How?

11:31.582 --> 11:34.284
What, you see us breaking into
the sheriff's station?

11:36.687 --> 11:39.123
I'm sorry, when did you
become all Scooby-Doo?

11:39.123 --> 11:40.324
I mean, who months ago,

11:40.324 --> 11:41.892
you were wiping your feet
on Maddie's face

11:41.892 --> 11:43.594
and now you're what,

11:43.594 --> 11:45.395
trading in your pom-pom
for a trench coat?

11:45.395 --> 11:47.898
- Nicole.
- No. It's weird.

11:47.898 --> 11:50.033
She's basically
caring about a janitor now.

11:50.033 --> 11:51.535
It's all to save her own skin.

11:51.535 --> 11:54.037
- Nicole, chill.
- No, you chill.

12:02.112 --> 12:04.581
Are you okay?

12:04.581 --> 12:05.849
Is this all about a portfolio

12:05.849 --> 12:07.818
or is there something else
going on?

12:09.753 --> 12:11.155
Wait.

12:11.155 --> 12:13.991
What if we head over
to the station before lunch,

12:13.991 --> 12:15.592
see if we can get into
that evidence room?

12:15.592 --> 12:17.961
- That's insane.
- I'm down for that.

12:17.961 --> 12:20.597
Yeah.
Me, too.

12:20.597 --> 12:23.033
- Nicole?
- I have a deadline.

12:26.003 --> 12:28.071
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>

12:28.071 --> 12:29.940
♪ Stella Brown ♪

12:29.940 --> 12:33.710
♪ I don't know
what to talk about ♪

12:33.710 --> 12:37.548
♪ How has my head
just hollowed out? ♪

12:37.548 --> 12:39.016
I don't think
this is working.

12:39.016 --> 12:40.984
Oh, well, that's just
because we need percussion.

12:40.984 --> 12:42.052
Here.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.153
- Oh, what's this?
- Bongos.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.154
- Oh.
- Okay.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.823
Five, six, seven, eight.

12:45.823 --> 12:48.058
♪ Stella Brown,
I don't know-- ♪

12:48.058 --> 12:49.393
Hey, that--Charlie.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.829
Hey, maybe this just
isn't the right song.

12:51.829 --> 12:53.096
Didn't you say this is

12:53.096 --> 12:54.231
what was coming out
of Simon's earbuds?

12:54.231 --> 12:56.934
Yeah.
It was a version of that.

12:56.934 --> 13:00.737
But it's not really
taking me back.

13:00.737 --> 13:02.606
I'm sorry, I don't really
think it's working.

13:02.606 --> 13:04.274
Okay, you know what?
Let's try hypnosis.

13:04.274 --> 13:07.177
Oh, God, no.
Not that.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.379
Hello, Dawn.
Uh, how long--

13:09.379 --> 13:11.048
how long
you been sitting there, girl?

13:11.048 --> 13:12.816
Since I smelled the burrito.

13:12.816 --> 13:15.018
It's outta sight, by the way.
Chicken or fish?

13:15.018 --> 13:16.286
Maybe.

13:16.286 --> 13:18.989
Yeah, um,
so what's wrong with hypnosis?

13:20.157 --> 13:21.391
Dawn, swallow first.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.295
It's way too risky.

13:25.295 --> 13:26.530
Why?

13:26.530 --> 13:28.632
Well, when you're hypnotized,

13:28.632 --> 13:31.468
it's like you have
a vacancy sign above your head.

13:31.468 --> 13:32.803
Your body
becomes an empty shell.

13:32.803 --> 13:35.505
Another spirit could walk in
and stay there.

13:35.505 --> 13:38.141
Did you get any of that?

13:38.141 --> 13:39.543
Maddie, I'm not gonna lie.

13:39.543 --> 13:41.345
I don't think we should
be listening to someone

13:41.345 --> 13:43.080
who cuts her hair
with a steak knife.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.581
Believe what you want,

13:44.581 --> 13:46.950
but any kind of walk-in
is risky.

13:46.950 --> 13:48.619
There's no gatekeeper.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.887
And they happen all the time.

13:49.887 --> 13:52.356
I had one friend who was
spellbound by the lights

13:52.356 --> 13:54.925
at a Jethro Tull concert.

13:54.925 --> 13:58.562
When it was over,
she only spoke Portuguese.

13:58.562 --> 14:01.031
Do you find the salsa
on her chin cute, too?

14:03.400 --> 14:05.369
I strongly recommend
an anti-séance.

14:05.369 --> 14:07.871
A--say what?

14:07.871 --> 14:10.908
Well, memories
are like spirits, guys.

14:10.908 --> 14:12.476
You just have to conjure
the right one.

14:12.476 --> 14:15.512
Uh, Dawn, thank you so much
for your time.

14:15.512 --> 14:16.747
We really appreciate it,

14:16.747 --> 14:18.148
but I think--
- We'll do it.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.584
We're gonna do it. We're--
anti-séance. Let's--

14:20.584 --> 14:22.052
let's do this thing, okay.

14:24.888 --> 14:28.392
Hey, sweet poster.
Looks professional.

14:28.392 --> 14:31.561
Canva template?

14:31.561 --> 14:33.964
Um, how much longer
you gonna need?

14:33.964 --> 14:35.198
What?

14:35.198 --> 14:37.401
At this computer.
When are you done?

14:37.401 --> 14:39.269
Nicole?

14:39.269 --> 14:40.437
May I help you?

14:40.437 --> 14:43.006
Yeah, I just need
this computer.

14:43.006 --> 14:45.008
I started my video statement
for my college app, and--

14:45.008 --> 14:47.811
Did you reserve it
for this period?

14:47.811 --> 14:49.313
No, but--

14:49.313 --> 14:52.482
Put your name in the log
and check back during lunch.

15:00.257 --> 15:01.858
<i>Why is this important
to you?</i>

15:01.858 --> 15:05.595
Why is Northwestern
your top choice?

15:05.595 --> 15:07.097
Because I like the proximity

15:07.097 --> 15:09.232
to a great city
without being in it,

15:09.232 --> 15:10.934
still has that campus-like
feeling.

15:10.934 --> 15:13.837
And...

15:15.005 --> 15:16.273
Seriously?

15:16.273 --> 15:18.809
It's all Maddie and I
ever talked about.

15:18.809 --> 15:20.577
We went to the Student
Film Festival last summer

15:20.577 --> 15:21.945
at the block--
- I'm sorry.

15:21.945 --> 15:23.413
Who's Maddie?

15:23.413 --> 15:25.449
Madison?

15:25.449 --> 15:26.683
Nears.

15:26.683 --> 15:28.585
She was supposed to meet
with you today.

15:28.585 --> 15:32.823
Ah.
Yes, I know who that is.

15:32.823 --> 15:35.993
I'm sorry.

15:36.994 --> 15:40.530
I'm guessing that after all
that's happened here recently,

15:40.530 --> 15:46.003
it might be a relief
to leave this school,

15:46.003 --> 15:47.004
this town,

15:47.004 --> 15:48.271
start fresh.

15:49.606 --> 15:54.244
What do you think you'd bring
to our campus?

15:54.244 --> 15:56.380
Simon?

15:56.380 --> 15:58.482
What?

15:58.482 --> 16:00.350
What are you
passionate about?

16:00.350 --> 16:03.453
What's your proudest
achievement of the last year?

16:03.453 --> 16:05.989
Um...

16:05.989 --> 16:07.424
not sure I have one.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.694
Excuse me?

16:10.694 --> 16:13.063
You read "Crime and Punishment"
in a weekend.

16:13.063 --> 16:15.098
You wrote a fan letter
to Guillermo del Toro

16:15.098 --> 16:16.700
and he wrote you back.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.335
You co-created a podcast

16:18.335 --> 16:20.570
and interviewed the dude who
designed Freddy Krueger's face.

16:20.570 --> 16:22.205
What's your favorite subject?

16:25.542 --> 16:27.377
I like a little bit
of everything.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.979
What are you doing?

16:28.979 --> 16:30.747
She's not asking you
what you like on your burger.

16:30.747 --> 16:34.217
Our admission rate's
fairly competitive.

16:34.217 --> 16:35.452
We're looking for students

16:35.452 --> 16:36.686
who want to make a mark
on our campus.

16:36.686 --> 16:38.488
Any ideas about your major?

16:38.488 --> 16:39.723
I'm still figuring that out.

16:39.723 --> 16:40.824
Simon!

16:40.824 --> 16:42.025
Great.

16:42.025 --> 16:43.460
Had to be a room
where he can't hear me.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.895
Do you have
another appointment?

16:44.895 --> 16:47.064
No, no.

16:47.064 --> 16:48.632
No, I was just--

16:48.632 --> 16:51.334
I was just wondering
if we were almost done.

16:51.334 --> 16:53.703
You don't decide
when you're done, she does.

16:53.703 --> 16:54.938
I think I've gathered

16:54.938 --> 16:56.440
just about everything
I need to know.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.108
Cool.

16:58.108 --> 17:00.744
Well, it's great meeting you.
I like your jacket.

17:04.948 --> 17:06.149
Hey, guys.

17:06.149 --> 17:07.417
Sorry I'm late.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.885
What are you guys doing?

17:08.885 --> 17:10.587
She's gonna
file a police report

17:10.587 --> 17:11.688
while we check out evidence.

17:11.688 --> 17:12.856
What report?

17:12.856 --> 17:14.191
That I'm being stalked
and threatened

17:14.191 --> 17:17.160
by someone at this school
who messed up my car,

17:17.160 --> 17:18.895
and it can't be Mr. South

17:18.895 --> 17:21.498
'cause our janitor
is no longer allowed on campus.

17:25.936 --> 17:27.070
Yo!
Uh, Claire.

17:27.070 --> 17:31.308
I think one window's
probably enough.

17:31.308 --> 17:33.043
So you got, like, a thing
for strong women, right?

17:33.043 --> 17:34.511
That's your type?

17:34.511 --> 17:35.811
Yes, I guess so.

18:03.735 --> 18:05.136
Can you give me an
approximate time?

18:05.136 --> 18:06.471
Not really.

18:06.471 --> 18:11.142
Uh, sometime between
first period and lunch.

18:11.142 --> 18:12.710
Have you been getting
any other threats?

18:12.710 --> 18:15.880
Like messages
or note on the car?

18:15.880 --> 18:18.516
No, but they broke my window.

18:18.516 --> 18:20.018
Isn't that enough?

18:20.018 --> 18:22.153
So you are seeing it

18:22.153 --> 18:23.588
as a credible threat
to your safety?

18:23.588 --> 18:25.156
Aren't you?

18:25.156 --> 18:26.724
The animal
who went after Maddie

18:26.724 --> 18:28.993
could be coming for me next.

18:28.993 --> 18:31.796
They're targeting our campus.
- Excuse me, Sheriff.

18:31.796 --> 18:33.665
There's a call for you
on line three.

18:33.665 --> 18:34.866
Take a message.

18:34.866 --> 18:38.736
Yeah, I tried,
but it's Sandra Nears.

18:38.736 --> 18:40.304
Says someone may have
broken into her home

18:40.304 --> 18:42.573
while she was asleep.

18:44.242 --> 18:45.677
See?

18:45.677 --> 18:48.579
Couldn't that be the same
person who attacked my car?

18:48.579 --> 18:50.314
Just give me a minute.

19:23.715 --> 19:26.484
Hey, hey.
This is her backpack.

19:26.484 --> 19:27.752
Oh, there's no crowbar.

19:27.752 --> 19:28.786
They must still be
testing it for blood.

19:34.092 --> 19:36.360
Hey.
Guard the door, would you?

19:42.467 --> 19:44.202
Why didn't I see this before?

19:44.202 --> 19:45.536
See what?

19:45.536 --> 19:46.904
They were waving this
in front of my face

19:46.904 --> 19:47.872
when they dragged me down here.

19:47.872 --> 19:49.774
This is huge.

19:49.774 --> 19:52.977
What is?
Hey, talk to me.

19:52.977 --> 19:56.314
The boot print of Maddie's
you found in the woods.

19:56.314 --> 19:58.883
Nuh-uh. I didn't find it.
Nicole found it. Why?

19:58.883 --> 20:01.486
Were you there
when she found it?

20:01.486 --> 20:03.821
Yeah, yeah.

20:06.357 --> 20:07.992
No.

20:07.992 --> 20:11.596
We split up in the woods.
She was alone.

20:11.596 --> 20:13.631
Why?

20:17.201 --> 20:19.570
This is not Maddie's
boot print.

20:25.543 --> 20:27.445
- You're done now.
- Why?

20:27.445 --> 20:28.846
Because I said so.

20:28.846 --> 20:30.081
Put your little books away,
zip up, and get out now.

20:30.081 --> 20:31.382
I have this reserved until--

20:31.382 --> 20:32.850
Do you want to live
to see tenth grade?

20:32.850 --> 20:33.818
I'm not playing with you, douchebag.

20:33.818 --> 20:35.052
Move.

20:39.423 --> 20:40.658
Ah, look who's back.

20:40.658 --> 20:43.728
Yeah. Good timing, I guess.

20:43.728 --> 20:45.363
Fast question, Mr. Balkin.

20:45.363 --> 20:47.999
When files are wiped
from this hard drive,

20:47.999 --> 20:49.600
there's no other backups, right?

20:49.600 --> 20:51.836
Not necessarily.

20:51.836 --> 20:53.237
What?

20:53.237 --> 20:54.438
Oh, don't worry.
Nothing's ever really deleted.

20:54.438 --> 20:56.107
You just have to know
where to look.

20:56.107 --> 20:58.776
The program auto-saves
every three minutes.

20:58.776 --> 21:00.711
You good?

21:00.711 --> 21:02.547
Yeah.

21:06.150 --> 21:08.686
Oh, God.

21:13.958 --> 21:16.160
Where have you been?

21:16.160 --> 21:18.329
Hey, you guys go ahead.
I gotta take a phone call.

21:18.329 --> 21:20.631
The bell already rang, Simon.
We're late.

21:20.631 --> 21:24.435
Yeah, I know, but, uh,
I gotta take a phone call.

21:26.838 --> 21:28.239
Why'd you
leave the interview?

21:28.239 --> 21:29.941
Where'd you go?
- Sheriff's station.

21:29.941 --> 21:31.042
We need to talk about
that boot print

21:31.042 --> 21:32.210
Nicole found in the woods.

21:32.210 --> 21:34.011
You tanked that interview, Simon.

21:34.011 --> 21:35.780
That admissions person
thought you were a vegetable.

21:35.780 --> 21:37.281
You sat there like a mushroom.

21:37.281 --> 21:38.616
Technically not a vegetable.
It's a fungus.

21:38.616 --> 21:40.051
Why'd you do that?

21:40.051 --> 21:42.186
That Doc Marten boot print
had an original stamp

21:42.186 --> 21:43.888
on the bottom of it, Maddie--
it's the real thing.

21:43.888 --> 21:45.423
Yours are knockoffs, right?
- Who cares?

21:45.423 --> 21:46.891
You might.

21:46.891 --> 21:48.025
Someone wanted us to think
that you ran out of school

21:48.025 --> 21:49.861
on that last day
and into the woods.

21:49.861 --> 21:51.128
That interview was huge, Simon.

21:51.128 --> 21:54.031
Tell me what you were thinking.
- What?

21:54.031 --> 21:57.368
W-what do I need to explain?

21:57.368 --> 22:01.239
All of that stuff we talked
about doing at Northwestern,

22:01.239 --> 22:03.274
starting a horror film society,

22:03.274 --> 22:04.909
pulling all-nighters
to binge Stephen King,

22:04.909 --> 22:08.246
that was about us
doing that together.

22:08.246 --> 22:11.616
Now?

22:11.616 --> 22:14.518
What's the point?

22:14.518 --> 22:18.055
You can't stop living
because I'm not.

22:21.926 --> 22:23.160
Can we talk about Nicole

22:23.160 --> 22:24.829
and the weird secret
she might be keeping?

22:24.829 --> 22:27.198
She's acting really strange.

22:27.198 --> 22:28.833
Yeah, it's called grief.

22:28.833 --> 22:31.035
Or guilt.

22:31.035 --> 22:32.503
Or resentment.

22:35.006 --> 22:37.508
She may have a lot of that.

22:37.508 --> 22:39.076
Toward the both of us.

22:41.212 --> 22:42.680
Can you even
breathe in this thing?

22:42.680 --> 22:43.948
Not the point.

22:43.948 --> 22:46.250
You sit in the back,
you put on the mask,

22:46.250 --> 22:48.219
and then you freak people out
on their way to the toilet.

22:48.219 --> 22:49.820
Lotta people don't even
make it to the toilet.

22:49.820 --> 22:50.855
I'm still eating.

22:50.855 --> 22:52.123
This mask will make me gag.

22:52.123 --> 22:53.724
- Nicole, you don't have to go.
- What?

22:53.724 --> 22:55.493
You said "The Final Chapter"
was the best "Friday the 13th."

22:55.493 --> 22:57.061
You hate scary movies.
Just own it.

22:57.061 --> 22:59.163
That's not true.
I liked "Scream."

22:59.163 --> 23:01.299
That's scary satire.
Doesn't count.

23:01.299 --> 23:03.134
And you closed your eyes
the second the movie started.

23:03.134 --> 23:04.602
No, I didn't.

23:04.602 --> 23:06.137
You spent half of the movie
looking for that Twizzler

23:06.137 --> 23:07.371
you dropped on the ground.

23:07.371 --> 23:08.606
And you don't even like
black licorice.

23:08.606 --> 23:10.041
That's Maddie's thing.

23:10.041 --> 23:11.409
Okay, well, Maddie
didn't invent black licorice.

23:11.409 --> 23:14.445
No, but
she gets a spider ring.

23:15.813 --> 23:17.648
You get a spider ring.
- And you hate spiders.

23:17.648 --> 23:18.849
Not if the legs don't move.

23:18.849 --> 23:20.117
You don't need
to cop Maddie's style.

23:20.117 --> 23:22.320
- Simon, stop.
- I'm not.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.189
You turned pescatarian
when Maddie turned pescatarian,

23:25.189 --> 23:27.758
she gets a purple binder,
you get a purple binder,

23:27.758 --> 23:29.827
she tapes Billie Eilish lyrics
inside of her locker,

23:29.827 --> 23:31.295
the next day,

23:31.295 --> 23:32.596
you tape Billie Eilish lyrics
inside of your locker.

23:32.596 --> 23:34.165
Okay, we can like
the same song, Simon.

23:34.165 --> 23:36.634
It's not a big deal.

23:36.634 --> 23:38.235
He's right, though.

23:38.235 --> 23:40.304
Just own it. It's okay.
You know, it's fine.

23:40.304 --> 23:43.074
You think I'm owning you, too?

23:43.074 --> 23:45.209
Not in a bad way.

23:45.209 --> 23:47.845
Is there a good way?

23:47.845 --> 23:49.947
Fuck you guys.

23:49.947 --> 23:51.248
- Whoa, hey.
- Girl.

23:51.248 --> 23:54.118
No, it's okay.
You're right. It's, um...

23:54.118 --> 23:57.488
I'm totally a pathetic,
copycat loser.

23:57.488 --> 23:58.522
You know what?

23:58.522 --> 23:59.757
You can watch your

23:59.757 --> 24:00.858
"Friday the 13th" marathon
without me.

24:00.858 --> 24:02.159
And here's
your stupid fish sticks.

24:02.159 --> 24:03.761
I'm getting a goddamn burger.

24:07.365 --> 24:10.001
<i>Simon, we apologized.
That was...</i>

24:10.001 --> 24:11.168
last February.

24:11.168 --> 24:12.803
She's not holding onto that.

24:12.803 --> 24:14.472
Yeah?
How do we know?

24:14.472 --> 24:16.907
She may be collecting all
this crap in some mental jar,

24:16.907 --> 24:18.175
and at a dark moment--
- She what?

24:18.175 --> 24:20.411
Went after me?
Killed me?

24:20.411 --> 24:21.846
Simon,
we're talking about Nicole.

24:21.846 --> 24:23.047
Yeah.

24:23.047 --> 24:24.815
And I think
if we learned one thing,

24:24.815 --> 24:26.283
it's that we can't assume

24:26.283 --> 24:28.386
we know everything
about anybody.

24:28.386 --> 24:30.021
No, stop.
Pump the brakes.

24:30.021 --> 24:31.555
I--

24:31.555 --> 24:32.923
let's not go after
someone we care about

24:32.923 --> 24:34.725
until we have something real.

24:37.361 --> 24:39.663
If you're wrong,
she will never forgive you.

24:48.672 --> 24:50.474
The bags are 25¢.

24:50.474 --> 24:51.542
Okay.

25:00.317 --> 25:02.053
Have a nice day.

25:02.053 --> 25:03.487
Thanks.

25:04.655 --> 25:06.590
You know who that is,
don't you?

25:06.590 --> 25:07.992
Shh, shh.

25:07.992 --> 25:10.461
Everyone knows who that is.

25:32.516 --> 25:36.220
Mrs. Nears?
Um...

25:39.356 --> 25:41.192
I-I know we haven't met,

25:41.192 --> 25:42.993
but I remember you
from that assembly

25:42.993 --> 25:44.862
shortly after
Maddie went missing.

25:44.862 --> 25:48.265
Um, I just want to say, uh...

25:52.436 --> 25:56.774
I know it looks like
I harmed your daughter, but...

25:56.774 --> 25:58.275
nothing could be further
from the truth.

26:20.464 --> 26:24.168
So you all spent the morning
supplying triggers, hmm?

26:24.168 --> 26:25.436
Kind of.

26:25.436 --> 26:27.972
I mean, we sang, we dined,
we reminisced.

26:27.972 --> 26:29.173
Well, <i>she</i> reminisced.

26:29.173 --> 26:31.175
We mostly sang
and watched Dawn dine.

26:31.175 --> 26:32.510
So let me get this straight.

26:32.510 --> 26:36.981
You're keeping an eye on her
by indulging her?

26:36.981 --> 26:38.449
I'm doing what I can.

26:38.449 --> 26:39.683
That doesn't mean
I don't want to cross over.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.585
I do.

26:41.585 --> 26:46.924
She's just a friend who's
dealing with some heavy stuff.

26:48.759 --> 26:49.894
I can relate.

26:49.894 --> 26:55.065
Rhonda...

26:55.065 --> 26:57.701
I care for Maddie, too,

26:57.701 --> 27:00.804
but it's my job
to keep her balanced.

27:00.804 --> 27:02.139
She's been here for weeks.

27:02.139 --> 27:04.241
She doesn't even have one foot
firmly planted...

27:04.241 --> 27:05.442
In the afterlife.

27:05.442 --> 27:07.578
Now, I ask for your help

27:07.578 --> 27:10.948
because I thought you were
serious about your goals,

27:10.948 --> 27:12.449
and now I'm not so sure.

27:12.449 --> 27:13.584
- But I am. I--
- You're not.

27:13.584 --> 27:16.620
You're really not.

27:16.620 --> 27:19.056
Charlie, I didn't even hear
your come in.

27:19.056 --> 27:20.224
Yeah, sorry.

27:20.224 --> 27:22.760
I didn't mean
to, um, interrupt.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.461
I just, uh--

27:24.461 --> 27:26.263
Dawn said she's ready.

27:26.263 --> 27:28.232
Oh, okay. Um...

27:43.608 --> 27:45.343
What are you burning?
Sage?

27:45.343 --> 27:47.813
Couldn't find any.

27:47.813 --> 27:50.382
Hey, Dawn. What is that?
Is that an old Brussels sprout?

27:50.382 --> 27:52.217
Found it in the couch
in the faculty lounge.

27:52.217 --> 27:53.518
Hoping nobody misses it.

27:53.518 --> 27:55.620
If they did, it was in 1964.

27:55.620 --> 27:58.190
Whoa.
- No, no, no, no.

27:59.791 --> 28:01.126
Settle, settle,
settle, settle.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.862
We're under Capricornus.

28:03.862 --> 28:04.930
Who?

28:04.930 --> 28:06.698
The stars.

28:06.698 --> 28:07.733
Look up.

28:09.468 --> 28:11.536
Oh, no.
That's mold.

28:11.536 --> 28:13.739
Close your eyes, look inward,

28:13.739 --> 28:15.507
right to the back
of your skull.

28:15.507 --> 28:17.409
You sure you don't want
to try hypnosis?

28:18.744 --> 28:21.913
Breathe deeply.

28:21.913 --> 28:24.516
]

28:24.516 --> 28:26.485
Gently
take your neighbor's hand.

28:26.485 --> 28:27.986
Let's close the circle

28:27.986 --> 28:30.288
so Maddie can carry us back
to her last day here.

28:32.657 --> 28:34.793
What are you seeing, Mads?

28:36.428 --> 28:38.797
Uh, not much.
It's dark.

28:38.797 --> 28:39.998
Dark?

28:39.998 --> 28:41.833
Maybe it's the back
of her skull.

28:41.833 --> 28:45.504
Let me guide you.
I'll show you how it's done.

28:45.504 --> 28:48.340
I'll take us back
to my last day here,

28:48.340 --> 28:52.310
May 17th, 1972.

29:00.852 --> 29:03.388
There must be a schedule
for the janitors.

29:03.388 --> 29:05.891
What does it even look like?

29:05.891 --> 29:09.327
Well, it's probably like
a weekly calendar

29:09.327 --> 29:13.465
that comes from
Mr. Hartman's office.

29:13.465 --> 29:17.302
Xavier, look.

29:17.302 --> 29:20.172
Oh. Bingo.

29:20.172 --> 29:23.041
But do we really think this
will clear Mr. South's name?

29:23.041 --> 29:24.576
It'll at least tell us
who was here after school

29:24.576 --> 29:26.578
the day the video was shot.

29:26.578 --> 29:29.447
Can't believe
you remember the exact date.

29:29.447 --> 29:31.950
What is that, like,
National Blackmail Day?

29:31.950 --> 29:33.318
Hey.

29:33.318 --> 29:35.587
What do--what do we know?

29:35.587 --> 29:39.858
Just what I thought.
It was just us and the AV crew.

29:39.858 --> 29:41.026
Us?

29:41.026 --> 29:42.694
Yeah.
The cheerleaders.

29:42.694 --> 29:45.530
We let them film our practice
and we did some interviews.

29:45.530 --> 29:48.166
Hey, you may want to talk
to your friend, Nicole.

29:48.166 --> 29:49.434
She was definitely there.

30:01.012 --> 30:04.382
I can hear his black Oxfords
squeaking on the linoleum.

30:04.382 --> 30:06.952
Mr. Mazzara's the AV teacher.

30:06.952 --> 30:12.157
His office smells like
Hai Karate and cigarettes.

30:12.157 --> 30:14.726
When I get to the studio,
I'm the first one there.

30:14.726 --> 30:16.962
My friends, Beth and Karen,
are late.

30:16.962 --> 30:20.098
The three of us are doing
a project for social studies.

30:20.098 --> 30:23.235
We're gonna record
"I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar"

30:23.235 --> 30:24.569
in 26 languages.

30:24.569 --> 30:26.738
Uh, Dawn, hi.

30:26.738 --> 30:28.940
When are we gonna
get to Maddie?

30:30.442 --> 30:31.776
I go to the supply room

30:31.776 --> 30:33.411
to get all the microphones
and stuff.

30:33.411 --> 30:35.113
Then I hear Beth and Karen.

30:35.113 --> 30:37.215
They come in laughing,

30:37.215 --> 30:41.019
making jokes about some flakey,
spaced-out bimbo.

30:43.121 --> 30:47.826
And then I realize
they're talking about me.

30:49.594 --> 30:51.796
At first,
I don't want to believe it.

30:51.796 --> 30:54.165
These are my friends, right?

30:54.165 --> 30:59.137
I close the supply room door,
and I look through the window.

30:59.137 --> 31:00.739
And they--

31:00.739 --> 31:03.942
they keep ripping me apart.

31:03.942 --> 31:09.481
My voice, my hair, my clothes,
my teeth.

31:09.481 --> 31:12.484
It's brutal.

31:12.484 --> 31:13.919
They call me a joke.

31:19.491 --> 31:23.695
<i>And it just gets worse
and worse,</i>

31:23.695 --> 31:26.331
<i>and then they turn
and look my way.</i>

31:30.602 --> 31:32.837
<i>And I don't want them
to see me,</i>

31:32.837 --> 31:34.439
<i>so I reach towards
the light bulb to unscrew it,</i>

31:34.439 --> 31:35.440
<i>and--</i>

32:01.466 --> 32:04.235
Dawn.

32:04.235 --> 32:06.237
You okay?

32:10.342 --> 32:13.979
It should've been them.
Not me.

32:30.628 --> 32:32.831
I think we should stop.

32:32.831 --> 32:34.499
Maybe try something else
to help conjure our memories.

32:34.499 --> 32:37.702
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

32:45.477 --> 32:46.945
Everyone,

32:46.945 --> 32:48.947
leave your quizzes by the door
on your way out, please.

32:48.947 --> 32:50.548
Thank you.

32:52.584 --> 32:54.652
Hey.
Spoken to Nicole yet?

32:54.652 --> 32:56.054
I haven't seen her.

32:56.054 --> 32:58.189
Seems convenient
she skipped class, no?

33:03.161 --> 33:05.663
Simon, I can't give you extra
time today.

33:05.663 --> 33:07.165
I've got an appointment
off-campus.

33:07.165 --> 33:08.666
That's cool.

33:08.666 --> 33:13.038
I was just re-vamping, anyway.

33:16.608 --> 33:17.776
- Thank you.
- We should talk.

33:17.776 --> 33:20.211
Yeah.
I have an update.

33:20.211 --> 33:21.846
Update on what?

33:21.846 --> 33:26.151
Oh, no, I was just
thinking out loud, sorry.

33:26.151 --> 33:27.919
You know,
there are people around here

33:27.919 --> 33:31.423
who are jumping to conclusions
because they need answers,

33:31.423 --> 33:35.193
but I believe in my heart
that Mr. South is innocent.

33:35.193 --> 33:37.529
I'm really hoping
they find the person who isn't.

33:37.529 --> 33:39.297
Soon.
- Me, too.

33:39.297 --> 33:40.632
Okay.

33:44.836 --> 33:46.805
I know
you don't want to hear this.

33:46.805 --> 33:47.972
There is a damn good chance

33:47.972 --> 33:49.541
Nicole took
that blackmail video.

33:49.541 --> 33:51.643
Our <i>friend</i> sent it to Anderson

33:51.643 --> 33:53.578
after she stole his number
off your phone.

33:53.578 --> 33:55.413
That's when
I thought it was you.

33:55.413 --> 33:57.048
And if you're gonna try
and stop me, Maddie--

33:57.048 --> 33:58.249
I'm not.

33:58.249 --> 34:01.219
I need to know, too.

34:01.219 --> 34:04.122
You're right.

34:04.122 --> 34:07.959
It may have hurt her
more than we thought.

34:07.959 --> 34:12.030
I just--

34:12.030 --> 34:15.366
I don't want to believe
there's, like,

34:15.366 --> 34:17.102
no one left that I can trust.

34:17.102 --> 34:19.237
Hey.

34:19.237 --> 34:21.706
Hello.

34:21.706 --> 34:24.809
I'm right here.

34:24.809 --> 34:27.011
I'm not going anywhere.

34:27.011 --> 34:28.346
I know.

34:28.346 --> 34:31.950
I love you, Maddie.

34:37.489 --> 34:41.693
And that's why I don't give a
flying fuck about Northwestern.

34:41.693 --> 34:44.062
You're not gonna be there.

34:46.131 --> 34:48.199
- Simon--
- Don't.

34:48.199 --> 34:54.038
Please. You don't have
to say anything, okay?

34:54.038 --> 34:56.207
Honestly...

34:56.207 --> 34:57.509
I'm not even sure why

34:57.509 --> 34:59.144
I'm trying to solve
whatever happened to you,

34:59.144 --> 35:02.313
because that'll probably just...

35:02.313 --> 35:05.350
help you cross over.

35:05.350 --> 35:08.086
And that'll take you
further away from me.

35:12.056 --> 35:13.658
You know
you're gonna graduate in June

35:13.658 --> 35:16.828
and leave this place, too.

35:16.828 --> 35:20.431
And you may leave it before me.

35:20.431 --> 35:24.235
Right.

35:24.235 --> 35:27.539
It's so messed up.

35:27.539 --> 35:28.840
It's not.

35:30.642 --> 35:33.178
I should go.

35:33.178 --> 35:36.214
You should leave.

35:44.422 --> 35:47.559
We should find Nicole.

35:47.559 --> 35:48.593
Okay?

36:13.017 --> 36:15.587
Hey.
Saw your truck outside.

36:15.587 --> 36:17.655
I was over at the school
looking for you.

36:17.655 --> 36:19.123
Last bell rang an hour ago.

36:19.123 --> 36:21.059
Yeah, well, I thought
maybe you'd still be there,

36:21.059 --> 36:22.961
make up for the time
you missed earlier.

36:22.961 --> 36:25.129
One of my new hires
saw a couple of teenage boys

36:25.129 --> 36:26.764
sneaking out the back door
of the precinct.

36:26.764 --> 36:28.900
One of 'em
matched your description.

36:28.900 --> 36:30.602
I was helping Claire
file a police report.

36:30.602 --> 36:33.338
Nobody's gonna mistake Claire
for a teenage boy.

36:33.338 --> 36:38.710
Yeah, well, they did,
so it was just me.

36:38.710 --> 36:39.844
I was there with Claire.

36:39.844 --> 36:42.947
To tamper with evidence?

36:42.947 --> 36:45.083
Man, it took weeks
to get the stink off you,

36:45.083 --> 36:46.551
now you're walking
right back into trouble.

36:46.551 --> 36:47.885
Why?

36:47.885 --> 36:49.687
I wasn't tampering
with anything, Dad.

36:49.687 --> 36:51.289
Man, how stupid
do you think I am?

36:51.289 --> 36:52.423
What are we,
running neck-and-neck

36:52.423 --> 36:54.025
in the dumbass derby?

36:54.025 --> 36:55.893
Hey, don't walk away from me.

36:55.893 --> 36:57.161
I don't want to do this here.

36:57.161 --> 36:58.429
I don't want to do this here, either,

36:58.429 --> 37:00.198
but if you're gonna
make it look like

37:00.198 --> 37:02.700
I can't look after my own kid,
then I'm gonna put it out there

37:02.700 --> 37:07.138
to the world that you're just
being a disrespectful loser.

37:07.138 --> 37:09.140
Hey, there,
Sherriff Baxter.

37:09.140 --> 37:10.975
Hi, Claire.
How you doing?

37:10.975 --> 37:12.810
Not so good.

37:12.810 --> 37:15.780
I'm thirsty,
my slushy's melting, and...

37:15.780 --> 37:17.548
I'm hearing you
call your son a loser.

37:17.548 --> 37:18.583
Claire.

37:18.583 --> 37:19.617
Last time I checked,

37:19.617 --> 37:20.918
a "loser" is an insecure bully

37:20.918 --> 37:22.987
who gets his kicks
by intimidating people.

37:22.987 --> 37:24.255
For the record,

37:24.255 --> 37:27.058
your son doesn't
fall under that definition.

37:27.058 --> 37:29.127
Can I have my slushie, please?

37:29.127 --> 37:30.461
Yeah.

37:30.461 --> 37:31.996
Thanks.

37:31.996 --> 37:33.564
Now maybe you can take me home.

37:33.564 --> 37:37.135
My parents don't like
for me to be out after dark.

37:37.135 --> 37:39.237
They don't think this town's
a safe place anymore.

37:51.683 --> 37:53.818
<i>Maybe you forgot
what we talked about.</i>

37:53.818 --> 37:58.389
<i>I absolutely have not.
But I'm going to get caught.</i>

38:18.176 --> 38:21.212
Don't bother, Nicole.

38:21.212 --> 38:23.881
We already know the truth.

38:23.881 --> 38:25.883
What truth?
What are you talking about?

38:27.585 --> 38:30.054
That boot print you found
in the woods?

38:30.054 --> 38:31.255
Was that
to give Maddie's mother hope

38:31.255 --> 38:32.990
or let yourself off the hook?

38:32.990 --> 38:34.425
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:34.425 --> 38:37.462
You sent Anderson that video
and blackmailed him.

38:37.462 --> 38:39.864
Didn't you?
Why?

38:39.864 --> 38:41.332
Why'd you need the money?

38:41.332 --> 38:43.835
Simon, you're seriously
having some kind of breakdown.

38:43.835 --> 38:45.970
You need meds.

38:45.970 --> 38:48.239
Buying those Horror-Con
tickets,

38:48.239 --> 38:51.109
helping Maddie's mom pass out
missing flyers at homecoming,

38:51.109 --> 38:52.543
leaving the dance
to "help" her,

38:52.543 --> 38:54.612
was that all about creating
some kind of smokescreen?

38:54.612 --> 38:57.115
So what really happened?

38:57.115 --> 39:00.084
How did you get out
of that boiler room alive,

39:00.084 --> 39:02.820
but Maddie didn't?

39:05.456 --> 39:07.358
What did you
need the money for?

39:07.358 --> 39:08.793
Huh?

39:08.793 --> 39:12.830
So you could split town?

39:12.830 --> 39:14.699
No, you asshole.

39:14.699 --> 39:16.300
So I could be with you.

39:16.300 --> 39:17.668
And Maddie.

39:17.668 --> 39:19.971
I needed the money
so I could move to Chicago

39:19.971 --> 39:22.440
and be near
your frickin' college.

39:22.440 --> 39:25.276
What?

39:25.276 --> 39:27.678
Why, the art schools you're
applying to are in Chicago.

39:27.678 --> 39:29.914
Yeah, and I can't get into
either one of them.

39:32.650 --> 39:34.819
You don't know that.

39:34.819 --> 39:36.053
When I showed them
my portfolio,

39:36.053 --> 39:37.388
both admissions counselors said

39:37.388 --> 39:38.790
there wasn't
a snowball's chance in hell

39:38.790 --> 39:40.191
I was getting a scholarship.

39:40.191 --> 39:42.660
They basically said
my portfolio sucked,

39:42.660 --> 39:44.762
and there's no fucking way
my parents are gonna pay

39:44.762 --> 39:48.266
for me to go to Chicago
and hang out with my friends.

39:48.266 --> 39:50.101
We don't have
that kind of money.

39:54.972 --> 39:56.374
Did you actually believe

39:56.374 --> 40:00.478
I could ever
intentionally hurt Maddie?

40:00.478 --> 40:03.114
I mean, yeah,
I stole the teacher's number,

40:03.114 --> 40:04.916
but I did that
so I could keep us together,

40:04.916 --> 40:06.651
not tear us apart.

40:08.319 --> 40:12.590
But I screwed up, okay?

40:12.590 --> 40:14.091
I didn't know

40:14.091 --> 40:16.427
Maddie was the only one
who had Mr. Anderson's number.

40:16.427 --> 40:19.430
How was I supposed
to know that?

40:19.430 --> 40:23.901
I spent weeks thinking
I was the reason she got hurt.

40:23.901 --> 40:27.405
You should've said something.

40:27.405 --> 40:28.773
Why didn't you tell
Maddie and I

40:28.773 --> 40:32.243
about that portfolio review?

40:35.880 --> 40:38.483
And give you more reasons
to think I'm pathetic?

40:40.151 --> 40:44.522
No, thanks.

40:57.768 --> 40:59.303
Nicole.

40:59.303 --> 41:02.707
Can I ask you something?

41:02.707 --> 41:05.977
Where's the money?

41:05.977 --> 41:08.079
If you turn it in
to the police,

41:08.079 --> 41:10.414
they'll know
Mr. South doesn't have it.

41:10.414 --> 41:13.918
We'll be closer to finding out
what really happened to Maddie.

41:13.918 --> 41:18.956
Nicole, that money could
help a man prove his innocence.

42:01.894 --> 42:03.796
Do we need to go back
to my house and get a shovel?

42:03.796 --> 42:05.230
No, I got one in my trunk.

42:05.230 --> 42:07.032
Of course you do.

42:13.772 --> 42:15.674
Maddie?

42:22.448 --> 42:24.383
I'm really sorry
I wasn't able to help you.

42:24.383 --> 42:26.418
Dawn, please. You don't need
to apologize to me.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.554
But I really wanted
to take you back.

42:28.554 --> 42:30.089
No, it's okay.

42:30.089 --> 42:33.058
If anything,
you deserve an apology.

42:33.058 --> 42:35.994
And I'm sorry if anyone
ever made you feel like a joke,

42:35.994 --> 42:37.529
'cause you're not.

42:40.799 --> 42:43.268
Well, I--

42:43.268 --> 42:45.571
I think I hurt people, too.

42:45.571 --> 42:48.107
And I wish I would've
been there for them.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.209
When I still could.

42:54.046 --> 42:57.449
Y-you gonna be okay?

42:57.449 --> 42:59.885
Mm-hmm.

43:02.321 --> 43:04.890
You're a good friend.

43:25.277 --> 43:26.612
Maddie?

43:28.680 --> 43:31.183
I wanna make sure she's okay.

43:31.183 --> 43:33.051
Let's check
the faculty lounge.

43:33.051 --> 43:35.787
She didn't say
she needed a nap.

43:35.787 --> 43:37.756
Well, maybe she went
to speak with Simon.

43:37.756 --> 43:39.124
Sorry.

43:39.124 --> 43:40.626
Why are you sorry?

43:40.626 --> 43:42.694
You wince every time
you hear his name.

43:42.694 --> 43:45.664
This is not me wincing,
this is my happy face.

43:45.664 --> 43:47.299
Oh.
Could've fooled me.

43:47.299 --> 43:49.668
Look.

43:49.668 --> 43:51.770
I know she's still trying
to figure her stuff out,

43:51.770 --> 43:53.472
but I can wait.

43:53.472 --> 43:54.673
We're not even at halftime.

43:54.673 --> 43:57.442
I don't know what that means,

43:57.442 --> 43:58.777
but if that is your happy face,

43:58.777 --> 44:00.779
remind me to hide
when you're really happy.

44:00.779 --> 44:05.784
Hey, has anyone seen Dawn
since the séance?

44:05.784 --> 44:07.219
She's not there.

44:07.219 --> 44:09.855
Weird.
She's usually there.

44:16.461 --> 44:18.630
What the hell is that?

44:47.192 --> 44:48.360
Did anybody else
just feel that?

44:48.360 --> 44:50.028
Goosebumps.
Yeah.

44:53.732 --> 44:58.637
Do we think that Dawn just--
- Dawn just crossed over.

44:58.637 --> 45:01.139
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

45:01.139 --> 45:04.710
Holy crap.

45:04.710 --> 45:07.079
Does anybody remember
this happening when Janet left?

45:07.079 --> 45:08.547
Nope.

45:14.253 --> 45:16.255
Come on.

45:19.024 --> 45:20.659
I'm telling you
this is where it was.

45:20.659 --> 45:21.893
Maybe it's a different one.

45:21.893 --> 45:23.161
Maybe this one was made
by an animal.

45:23.161 --> 45:24.563
It was right here.

45:24.563 --> 45:26.865
Maybe it's closer
to the fence.

45:26.865 --> 45:29.801
No, I buried it
in a garbage bag right here.

45:29.801 --> 45:32.838
Nicole, it was dark.
You were stressed.

45:32.838 --> 45:34.273
No, I remember the stump, Simon.

45:34.273 --> 45:38.243
It was here, it was right here,
and now it's gone.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.548
I came out here, I buried it,
and somebody came and stole it.

45:43.548 --> 45:46.018
- Who knew you were out here?
- What?

45:46.018 --> 45:48.453
Were you being followed
when you left the dance?

45:48.453 --> 45:49.821
Did someone follow you
out here?

45:49.821 --> 45:51.657
I didn't come here
after the dance.

45:51.657 --> 45:53.458
I went to Maddie's mom's house, remember?

45:53.458 --> 45:55.360
I came here straight
from Sandra's.

45:58.096 --> 45:59.431
Did she follow you here?

45:59.431 --> 46:00.832
What? Why would Sandra
take this money?

46:04.536 --> 46:06.605
- You're being a brat!
- That belonged to me!

46:06.605 --> 46:07.973
You have to get over it!

46:09.441 --> 46:10.709
When you were walking
back to your car,

46:10.709 --> 46:12.544
did you see anybody
follow you out here?

46:12.544 --> 46:14.046
No, I was alone.

46:14.046 --> 46:15.747
There was music playing
at the dance

46:15.747 --> 46:16.982
and a couple people outside...
- Simon.

46:16.982 --> 46:18.884
- But that was it.
- There's someone there!

46:18.884 --> 46:20.285
Nicole, think!

46:20.285 --> 46:22.754
Simon! Look behind you!
Nicole!

46:22.754 --> 46:26.625
I made sure of it!
No one saw me! I swear!

46:26.625 --> 46:28.527
Simon, look behind you!

46:28.527 --> 46:30.429
What's wrong?

46:30.429 --> 46:31.830
Did you hear that?

46:31.830 --> 46:34.199
What?

46:35.701 --> 46:36.935
Wait!
Simon!

46:36.935 --> 46:38.136
Simon, don't!

46:38.136 --> 46:41.106
Don't! Please don't! Simon!

46:41.106 --> 46:42.174
- Maddie!
- Leave me alone!

46:42.174 --> 46:43.975
Mom, don't!
Mom, please.

46:49.214 --> 46:51.650
Maddie.
You okay?

46:51.650 --> 46:54.820
What's going on?

46:54.820 --> 46:58.790
I need to talk to my mother.

46:58.790 --> 47:01.259
Why?

47:01.259 --> 47:04.596
I think
she may have killed me.
