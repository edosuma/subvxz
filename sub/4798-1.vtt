01:55.800 --> 01:58.990
Ghent, June 2006

02:06.920 --> 02:08.669
Round your arm.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.550
Look at Mummy.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.350
It'll feel a bit tight.

02:17.160 --> 02:18.870
Keep still, sweetie.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.270
Don't cry.

02:24.880 --> 02:27.750
All done. All done.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.590
Don't do that. It's all done now.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.790
Right. The doctor will see you now.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.990
And I'll stay with this little lady.
- Be good, eh?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.750
Hello, little lady.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.110
What's this?
- My rucksack.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.390
No, it's a giant ladybird.
- It's a rucksack!

02:51.600 --> 02:52.580
A giant ladybird!

02:55.520 --> 02:57.630
Hello, doctor.
- Come in.

03:21.440 --> 03:26.070
Can you watch on your own for a moment?
Mummy and Daddy are just popping out.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.780
There's a good girl.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.430
Can we agree on one thing?

03:42.640 --> 03:47.500
We do our crying at home.
When we're in here we're positive, OK?

03:49.200 --> 03:50.230
OK.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.030
Come on.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.110
Look at her.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.990
She's fine.
- Yeah...

04:08.360 --> 04:09.500
Isn't she?

04:17.399 --> 04:19.779
We're going to shoot it dead tomorrow.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.750
What are we going to do?
- Shoot the cancer dead.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.110
Yes!
- Yes!

04:26.360 --> 04:28.070
Bump heads!

04:31.840 --> 04:35.350
Go to sleep now, you silly sausage.
- That'll do.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.430
7 years previously

05:11.080 --> 05:13.270
Does all that belong to you?
- Yes.

05:13.440 --> 05:17.550
Wow! Very nice!
- But it needs a lot of work done to it.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.910
Still...
- So for now I sleep... there.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.430
In that caravan?

05:24.240 --> 05:27.780
You're a real cowboy after all!
- I do my best.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.590
Is that horse yours too?
- Yes, that's Earl.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.750
Chickens!

05:40.120 --> 05:43.430
Is he bad-tempered?
- No, he's very sweet-natured.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.870
J.D. Crowe and The New South.
Then the Tony Rice Unit.

05:56.040 --> 06:00.150
Manzanita is definitely
my favourite CD ever.

06:00.320 --> 06:03.230
He used to have a fantastic voice.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.670
But he lost It.
It's such a shame.

06:06.840 --> 06:11.590
I don't know how. Following an illness
or something. Or a bit too much whisky!

07:17.600 --> 07:19.550
Why do you play the banjo?

07:19.720 --> 07:24.510
I'm too stupid to play the guitar
and too dumb to play the mandolin.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.950
No, no. I used to be a punk rocker

07:27.120 --> 07:31.390
and a banjo sort of snarls,
which reminds me of punk rock.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.110
I love it.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.830
How come you've got so many tattoos?

08:56.680 --> 08:58.110
Elise?

09:04.840 --> 09:06.830
Hi, cowboy.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.020
Seeing as you don't want a tattoo...

09:22.320 --> 09:23.430
Do you like it?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.590
Yes.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.550
Good afternoon.
- Shhh, shhh.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.310
Here we are with lunch.

09:55.520 --> 09:59.390
She's just fallen asleep.
- The hospital has its set times.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.390
Maybelle is ill!
- Sweetheart...

10:02.600 --> 10:04.950
Ill!
- Sweetheart...

10:05.120 --> 10:09.510
You could say something too, Didier.
- Say what? Eh? What?

10:14.440 --> 10:15.950
Sorry.

10:17.640 --> 10:18.990
Sorry.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.140
Hey, Maybelle.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.230
Sorry, sweetie.
Mummy shouldn't shout like that, eh?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.390
Sorry.

10:31.680 --> 10:34.140
Sorry.
- It's alright.

10:56.200 --> 11:01.140
Now we're going to do our best to sit
very still. You'll feel a little prick.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.310
Well done.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.070
OK, ready?

11:09.680 --> 11:11.870
That hurt.

11:25.960 --> 11:30.110
You knew, eh? Who gave it to me?
- Your mummy.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.030
Before that it belonged to
my mummy's mummy.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.870
And before that to
my mummy's mummy's mummy.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.230
And now I'm giving it to you.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.550
Because I'm your mummy.

11:43.360 --> 11:47.790
And when you're grown up,
you can give it to your little girl.

11:48.040 --> 11:53.110
But until then I want you to hold on
tightly to it when you feel sad,

11:53.280 --> 11:56.430
or when you're scared
or when you feel lonely.

11:56.640 --> 12:01.030
Then close your eyes
and think of something nice.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.670
Shall we give it a try?

12:26.240 --> 12:30.550
Dirt-poor fortune-hunters
from all over the world

12:30.720 --> 12:33.390
were there on the Appalachians,

12:33.600 --> 12:36.790
on that slate
that was bloody difficult to mine.

12:50.320 --> 12:54.670
The Spaniard had a guitar,
the Italian a mandolin,

12:54.840 --> 12:57.710
the Jew a violin
and the African a banjar,

12:57.880 --> 13:00.870
from which the banjo is descended.

13:13.920 --> 13:18.510
To combat the hunger and the misery,
they started singing songs

13:18.680 --> 13:21.870
about their dreams of a promised land,

13:22.040 --> 13:26.190
often about their fear of dying,

13:26.360 --> 13:29.390
their hope for a better life
in the hereafter

13:29.600 --> 13:34.620
and their sorrow, their hard life.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.110
Didier?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.590
Didier?

16:52.080 --> 16:55.310
Elise, can you come and help me,
sweetheart?

16:55.520 --> 16:56.740
Where are you?

16:57.880 --> 16:59.430
Didier?

17:07.119 --> 17:08.150
What?

17:08.319 --> 17:09.869
What's the matter?

17:10.359 --> 17:12.069
Are you alright, sweetheart?

17:17.240 --> 17:18.300
I'm pregnant.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.349
Three months.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.590
What?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.390
Maybe I don't want that.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.790
How did that happen?
How come?

17:39.960 --> 17:44.550
I... I've never been regular.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.350
What do you think?

17:52.880 --> 17:56.790
That I knew?
That I've tricked you into this?

17:56.960 --> 18:00.790
Maybe I don't want to make decisions
about someone else's life.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.510
I didn't know.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.430
D'you expect us to carry on
living in that caravan with a baby?

20:28.720 --> 20:31.180
Hello, Maybelle.
- Hello, doctor.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.390
I love your face.

20:33.600 --> 20:37.030
You can go home tomorrow.
- Yes!

20:37.520 --> 20:40.950
Great, eh? But you have to
come back in a few weeks.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.750
Like I told you, eh?
- Yes.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.070
Then we can see
if Captain Chemo won the fight.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.670
Thank you, doctor.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.870
What are you?
- A tiger.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.230
A tiger.

20:52.880 --> 20:56.630
And what is Mummy?
- A butterfly.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.390
What do tigers do?

21:23.840 --> 21:25.030
What's that?

21:25.560 --> 21:29.590
Can you hear what I can hear?
There's someone in our house.

21:29.760 --> 21:32.950
Do you dare go and take a look?
Cos I don't. Go and see.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.190
Are you going to go and see?

21:39.040 --> 21:41.270
Well? Can you see anything?

21:51.320 --> 21:52.630
Funny, aren't they?

22:42.760 --> 22:46.270
I'm so pleased you're back.
- Welcome home.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.310
That's beautiful!

23:20.520 --> 23:22.670
Do you like it?
- Yes.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.590
Go on.
- What?

23:26.760 --> 23:28.230
Carry on.

24:25.680 --> 24:27.150
Hey, darling.
- Yeah?

24:27.320 --> 24:31.310
How about building a veranda
onto the front of the house?

24:32.080 --> 24:33.790
A what? A veranda?

24:33.960 --> 24:37.500
There's nothing more useless
than a veranda.

24:37.680 --> 24:41.070
You never sit in it.
You bought some steak tartare.

24:41.240 --> 24:44.860
But it'd be great, wouldn't it?
- A veranda is great.

24:45.040 --> 24:48.710
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
In summer you go outside when it's hot

24:48.880 --> 24:52.270
and in winter you stay indoors
by the stove.

24:52.440 --> 24:56.310
But we live in Belgium,
where it's a bit too cold to sit outside

24:56.520 --> 24:58.550
and a bit too hot to stay indoors.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.910
You really bought some steak tartare?

25:06.600 --> 25:10.380
That's not steak tartare!
- It's vegetarian. Nice, isn't it?

25:10.600 --> 25:12.230
Bloody hell! Come on!

25:12.400 --> 25:16.180
I don't like sitting in the wind
and neither does our baby.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.670
So it's decided, you need a veranda.

25:22.200 --> 25:27.350
OK, you'll get your veranda but this is
the last time you use that argument.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.310
Thanks.
- What? It's only a veranda.

25:32.840 --> 25:36.710
Well? Do you know what it is yet?
- A baby, I reckon.

25:37.800 --> 25:42.510
But I can't be sure. With Didier being
such a stallion, it could be a foal.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.350
Shit.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.590
It's coming. My water has broken.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.070
Keep calm. Sit down.
- No.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.990
Keep calm, keep calm.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.750
Elise has had the baby. It's a girl.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.830
Yes, it's really...

26:20.080 --> 26:22.150
Maybelle. Maybelle.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.390
Yes, like Maybelle Carter.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.710
You know nothing about names!

26:30.560 --> 26:33.150
No, no. Hands down.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.060
What's that?

26:43.360 --> 26:44.390
What?

26:44.600 --> 26:48.380
That's not a veranda, sweetheart.
- No... No, it's a 'terranda'.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.910
The perfect combination of
a terrace and a veranda.

26:52.120 --> 26:56.390
It's lovely. It's wonderful. Thank you.

26:56.920 --> 27:00.310
Go on. Go on. That's it!

27:01.640 --> 27:03.510
Go on. That's it!

27:04.280 --> 27:06.150
Look. Oh, watch out...

27:08.200 --> 27:12.950
<i>It is the worst terrorist attack
ever experienced by the United States...</i>

27:48.920 --> 27:50.310
Look, look.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.710
Happy New Year!

30:20.280 --> 30:23.430
Are you going to become a cowgirl too?
- Yes.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.750
Daddy!

31:13.960 --> 31:17.790
Put that down, Maybelle.
Give it to me, sweetie.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.990
Don't cry.
Give it to me, sweetie.

31:27.800 --> 31:31.390
Why is the birdie dead, Daddy?

31:32.800 --> 31:37.070
Well, sweetie...
the birdie flew into the glass...

31:37.640 --> 31:39.940
Birds don't know what glass is.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.680
They think that
if they can see through it,

31:42.840 --> 31:46.190
they can fly through it.
Not very clever of them, eh?

31:46.360 --> 31:50.870
Where does the birdie go when it's dead?

31:52.800 --> 31:59.060
We... We just have to throw it away now.
Eh, Maybelle?

31:59.640 --> 32:03.550
We mustn't put it on the compost heap.
It's like a chicken,

32:03.720 --> 32:05.110
it's got bones in it.

32:05.280 --> 32:08.390
We'll throw it in the dustbin. Come on.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.270
No, Daddy.

32:10.880 --> 32:14.350
It's dirty, darling.
Give it to me, sweetie.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.990
I'll throw it away for you, OK?

32:18.880 --> 32:21.070
Do you want to throw it away?

32:23.200 --> 32:25.830
Give it to me. Come on.

32:27.920 --> 32:30.590
Come on. Give it to me.
Give it to me.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.070
No!

32:36.400 --> 32:37.830
Maybelle!

32:44.200 --> 32:45.870
The chemo isn't working.

32:47.320 --> 32:52.670
Her bone marrow is producing
abnormal white blood cells again.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.110
Which isn't very good news, of course.

32:55.280 --> 32:58.350
But, as we've already discussed,
we're not giving up yet.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.670
We will simply move on to
the next stage in the treatment,

33:02.840 --> 33:05.710
a stem cell transplant.

33:05.880 --> 33:09.630
First, we will destroy
her own bone marrow

33:09.800 --> 33:12.990
with more chemo and radiotherapy,

33:13.160 --> 33:17.710
then we will replace it with
new stem cells from a donor.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.590
A donor who is
as close to Maybelle as possible.

33:20.760 --> 33:23.790
Unfortunately, parents can't
be considered as donors.

33:59.720 --> 34:01.270
How did it go?

34:02.720 --> 34:06.190
It was a difficult afternoon.
- How come?

34:06.360 --> 34:07.990
Just after you'd gone

34:08.159 --> 34:14.710
she was doing some drawing outside and
another bird flew into our terranda.

34:14.880 --> 34:21.429
I came out and she was standing there
crying, with a dead bird in her hands.

34:22.280 --> 34:27.870
That wouldn't happen with a veranda.
- It'd happen even more! Stupid birds!

34:28.120 --> 34:34.190
You'd think that it would eventually
be written in their genes.

34:34.360 --> 34:39.630
That it'd become a sort of instinct
passed on from mummy bird to chick,

34:39.800 --> 34:45.270
that when they see a frame they realize
it's dangerous to try to fly through it.

34:47.520 --> 34:51.550
But innumerable generations of birds
obviously need to

34:51.719 --> 34:54.989
fly into that window
before it starts to get through to them.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.190
Bye.
- Bye.

35:04.520 --> 35:08.140
You should try explaining to a child

35:08.600 --> 35:11.710
how come the bird isn't moving anymore.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.750
It's difficult.
- I know.

35:15.920 --> 35:20.780
You want to say people have come up with
all kinds of ways of dealing with it.

35:20.960 --> 35:24.070
That some people believe
the bird has a soul

35:24.240 --> 35:27.310
that doesn't die and goes up to heaven.

35:27.520 --> 35:32.270
That it'll see it's mummy and daddy
again there and will fly around forever

35:32.440 --> 35:36.270
in a place where the sun always shines
and there aren't any windows.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.870
That other people believe
the bird is a martyr

35:41.040 --> 35:43.270
in the fight against windows.

35:43.440 --> 35:48.110
And after his death he'll be given lots
of female birds that have never mated

35:48.280 --> 35:50.840
and he can do what he wants with them.

35:51.160 --> 35:54.780
But Daddy doesn't believe in
any of that.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.230
Daddy thinks that...

35:59.520 --> 36:02.990
that everything just dies
and stays dead.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.340
But...

36:05.560 --> 36:11.710
But you can't say that.
- No, you can't say that, Didier.

36:27.680 --> 36:32.110
Her natural resistance will be
destroyed completely first

36:32.280 --> 36:33.630
and she'll be very weak.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.790
Which is why we're putting her in
a sterile, pressurized room.

36:37.960 --> 36:41.790
The new blood cells may attack her body.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.990
That doesn't happen with
identical stem cells

36:46.160 --> 36:50.430
but you only find those in the case of
identical twins or cloned embryos.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.310
Unfortunately, science
hasn't got that far yet.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.190
Her chances are very good.

36:58.360 --> 37:01.710
She has a very good chance of
being completely cured.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.710
Don't lose heart.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.780
Thank you.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.230
Daddy?
- Yes?

37:19.520 --> 37:23.060
That birdie has become a star now.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.230
OK, sweetie.

37:34.160 --> 37:39.390
If you want to believe that
that birdie is a star now, then it is.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.390
I'll tell you what, choose one.

37:48.280 --> 37:49.870
That one.

37:50.680 --> 37:54.300
That one?
That big shiny one up there?

37:54.520 --> 37:56.670
That one? OK.

38:00.720 --> 38:04.070
Bye-bye, birdie.
- Bye-bye, birdie.

38:10.840 --> 38:14.350
I love you.
- I love you too.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.070
Clever girl.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.550
And that, that's blood.

38:20.720 --> 38:24.550
The stem cells are In there.
Stem cells are little soldiers

38:24.720 --> 38:29.270
who will march down that tube
into your blood.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.310
And those little soldiers mean business.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.310
Understand? Eh?

38:36.520 --> 38:38.190
They are going to cure you.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.820
Hey.
- Hello.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.750
We're allowed to go home.
- Are you?

38:45.920 --> 38:49.750
Milan's levels are perfect
- Great!

38:50.200 --> 38:52.230
Congratulations.

39:25.200 --> 39:28.350
Is it a plane? Is it a bird?

39:28.560 --> 39:31.910
No, it's not.
- Maybelle...

39:32.080 --> 39:37.310
It's Mega Mindu.
- It's too early. Get some more sleep.

39:37.520 --> 39:41.750
You're far too lively for me.
- Is it a plane? Is It a bird?

39:41.920 --> 39:45.110
No, it's not.
- How about getting some more sleep?

39:45.280 --> 39:48.430
No, I'm 6, I was allowed to
wake you up early.

39:48.640 --> 39:53.580
Oh yes, of course,
it's your birthday.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.320
No, don't tickle me! Don't!

39:57.520 --> 40:00.150
Don't, don't tickle me!
- Happy birthday!

40:00.320 --> 40:03.310
6 years old! Happy birthday, sweetie.
- Happy birthday.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.590
You look... You look lovely.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.510
In your pink costume.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.030
How about getting some more sleep?
- No.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.340
Yes. Come on.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.900
Right, have you almost finished?

40:53.080 --> 40:54.790
Come on, sweetie.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.190
Rinse your mouth.

41:03.520 --> 41:06.790
That's it. Come on, put your shoes on.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.270
Come on, sweetie, get a move on.

41:11.440 --> 41:16.870
Now what? Get the other one. Come on.
- I'm tired, Mummy.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.350
So am I, sweetie. We're all tired.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.270
But we have to get a move on, eh?

41:23.440 --> 41:25.390
Kiss.
- The bus is there. Come on.

41:25.640 --> 41:30.350
Coat.
- You're bleeding round your teeth.

41:30.560 --> 41:34.950
How often have I told you not to
scrub so hard with your toothbrush?

41:35.120 --> 41:37.500
Rucksack.
- Right.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.830
Let her go now.
- Alright.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.750
Didier?
- Yes?

42:02.920 --> 42:04.310
Just one.

42:05.720 --> 42:09.670
I'll open the door in a minute.
- Yeah, yeah.

42:14.040 --> 42:18.980
She's got more bruises on her arms.
- I know, I saw them.

48:53.920 --> 48:55.030
Hi.

48:57.200 --> 48:58.260
Hi.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.350
Here.

49:17.440 --> 49:18.350
Thanks.

49:33.960 --> 49:36.190
Shall I light the stove?

49:37.840 --> 49:40.070
No. No, it's OK.

49:42.160 --> 49:46.870
Sweetheart...
Can we go and see my mum Sunday?

49:48.000 --> 49:52.030
Yes... I think so.

50:01.320 --> 50:05.190
It's... It's Mother's Day on Sunday.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.830
She'll be pleased to see you.

51:11.880 --> 51:18.060
Fuck! Fuck! You're going to
pull through, sweetheart. Goddammit!

51:22.760 --> 51:25.220
Her heart has stopped.
Stop the ambulance.

51:27.360 --> 51:29.590
What the fuck is happening now?

51:39.600 --> 51:42.310
Adrenalin, OK?
- What's happening?

51:43.160 --> 51:45.190
What's happening?
- We're losing her.

51:45.360 --> 51:48.430
You're not losing her.
D'you hear me? You're not!

51:48.800 --> 51:50.950
Don't let her go! D'you hear me?

51:51.120 --> 51:53.830
Don't let her go.
- Move back and calm down, please.
