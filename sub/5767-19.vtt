WEBVTT

00:07.440 --> 00:09.362
I'm not sure.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.809
You're not... sure?

00:10.840 --> 00:13.172
I don't know
how to answer.

00:13.210 --> 00:14.802
With the truth.
I have

00:14.840 --> 00:16.649
an obligation.
_ No. _You're_ a
private Investigator.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.739
You don't haye_
attorney-client prIVIIege.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.771
Here's the problem,
Kalinda-- the IRS

00:20.820 --> 00:23.641
is investigating you
because of this check.

00:24.690 --> 00:27.079
$3,850.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.610
It was written
from what they determine

00:28.660 --> 00:30.389
is a dummy account,
and now they want

00:30.430 --> 00:32.159
accounting for
all your freelance work

00:32.200 --> 00:33.326
over the last three

00:33.360 --> 00:34.691
tax periods. 50...

00:34.730 --> 00:36.493
you need to answer
for these checks.

00:36.530 --> 00:39.431
Answer for...?
What the nature of the work
was and who paid for it.

00:39.470 --> 00:41.688
So let's start
with this check.

00:41.740 --> 00:45.608
$2,460 paid out by

00:45.640 --> 00:46.709
FRP Incorporated

00:46.740 --> 00:48.731
for three days' work.

00:48.780 --> 00:51.704
What was the nature
of that work and
who paid for it?

00:51.750 --> 00:55.345
Look... I don't...
I don't mean to
be guarded here.

00:55.380 --> 00:56.711
But you are
being guarded here.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.581
Yes, but the
difficulty is,

00:58.620 --> 01:01.384
is that I did this work for
someone you know, and...

01:01.420 --> 01:05.083
I think it would be unfair
to them to divulge it.

01:06.730 --> 01:09.767
It's not who
you think.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.098
And who do I think?

01:12.140 --> 01:13.767
One second.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.107
Hi.

01:22.510 --> 01:24.842
Diane, do you
have a minute?

01:29.520 --> 01:31.511
I did the work for Diane.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.211
Oh.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.889
Well... why wasn't it paid
through Lockhart/Gardner?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.659
Well, it's not
a work matter.

01:38.690 --> 01:41.591
Um, I'd rather stick
to generalities here.

01:41.630 --> 01:45.122
Okay. Uh, so how would
you define this work?

01:45.170 --> 01:47.434
Firearm lessons.

01:52.740 --> 01:55.208
Well, that helps.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.141
Oh, uh, Diane wants
to talk to you.
Okay, thanks.

01:58.180 --> 02:00.740
We're gonna have to go over
the other checks, but...

02:00.780 --> 02:02.714
I will try to stick
to generalities.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.786
Thanks. Um, I'll try
to get permission.

02:04.820 --> 02:05.912
_ DIANE:
I Just got a call

02:05.950 --> 02:08.851
asking me to sit on
a blue ribbon panel,

02:08.890 --> 02:10.858
and, uh, as you can see,

02:10.890 --> 02:12.699
I'm, uh, fairly busy.

02:12.730 --> 02:14.925
I_t's_a routine
CIVIIIan reVIew

02:14.960 --> 02:17.758
of an IPRA, Independent
Police Review Authority.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.233
It's a police shooting.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.737
They asked for
a replacement,

02:20.770 --> 02:22.533
and I suggested you.

02:22.570 --> 02:25.869
Me? Uh, wouldn't they want
someone with more experience?

02:25.910 --> 02:27.571
No. What they want is a woman.

02:27.610 --> 02:29.703
(laughs softly):
Well...
I mean, this
happens a lot.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.275
They go fishing at the last
minute for a balance,

02:32.320 --> 02:34.709
uh, Republican or a woman.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.786
I mean, it's good for
your career and the firm.

02:36.820 --> 02:39.584
You work with judges
and influential lavwers.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.815
Yes. Thank you,
I would love to, Diane.
Good.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.885
I'll give them a call.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.922
And... thank you
for my salary bump.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.951
Yes. I hear you're
buying a house.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.968
Well, I'm-I'm making
an offer today.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.865
Good.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.600
MAN:
They were out of town
so he gave me

02:57.640 --> 02:58.766
his tickets.

02:58.810 --> 03:01.233
Unbelievable-- best
seats I've ever had.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.646
Practically
courtside.
Really?

03:03.680 --> 03:05.477
He's got the best seats

03:05.510 --> 03:07.774
in the _center.
I'm telling you,

03:07.820 --> 03:10.311
I have never been
so close to the action...

03:10.350 --> 03:11.282
So you're the woman.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.356
(laughs):
Oh, I guess I am.

03:13.390 --> 03:15.585
(chuckles):
I'm the black.

03:15.620 --> 03:16.621
(laughs)

03:16.660 --> 03:18.685
Mike, how are you!

03:18.730 --> 03:20.652
Pastor Damon,
I'm so glad you could make it.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.793
I have a tape of one of your
sermons running in my car.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.798
DAMON:
Now, that is dangerous.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.536
And you know
His Honor Peter Dunaway.

03:26.570 --> 03:28.834
Nice to see
you agaIn.
And his Equally-honorable

03:28.870 --> 03:31.600
Harvey Winter.
Okay, we're gonna have
to cut that out or you're gonna

03:31.640 --> 03:32.834
be "honoring" it up all day.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.575
DAMON:
Gentlemen, it's
good to meet you.

03:34.610 --> 03:35.531
Chicago,

03:35.580 --> 03:39.778
to my mind, has the best
justice money can buy.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.947
(laughter)
MIKE:
Alicia Florrick.

03:41.980 --> 03:42.947
Now, this truly is an honor.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.844
Mike Kresteva,
of Sellers, Kresteva & Landry.

03:44.890 --> 03:45.982
Thank you

03:46.020 --> 03:47.885
for doing this.
Oh, no, no.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.012
Thank you for the invite.

03:49.060 --> 03:51.881
Although I have to admit
I feel a little... outclassed.

03:51.930 --> 03:52.954
Ah. Well,
here's the trick.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.719
Without the robes,
these judges are just pussycats.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.795
Isn't that so, Harv?

03:56.830 --> 03:59.594
Whatever he said
about me, he's lying.
(laughs)

03:59.640 --> 04:01.596
You've been in
my court-- MISS....

04:01.640 --> 04:03.699
Florrick.
I see.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.958
A woman and a connection to
the state's attorney's office.

04:06.010 --> 04:06.874
Nice bank shot, Mike.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.605
MIKE:
And I believe you know

04:08.640 --> 04:10.574
the incredibly handsome
Harvey Winter.

04:10.610 --> 04:12.316
I'm a friend of your
husband's, Mrs. Florrick.

04:12.350 --> 04:13.612
I'm glad to see
he's thriving.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.948
Thank you.
Well, I think
that's all of us.

04:15.980 --> 04:16.947
Shall we get started?

04:16.990 --> 04:18.639
We ask you, Lord,

04:18.690 --> 04:21.454
to give us a strong mind
and discerning spirit.

04:21.490 --> 04:25.483
We ask that the witnesses
answer honestly and completely.

04:25.530 --> 04:30.820
And, as always, we ask that your
truth guide us in all things.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.497
In Jesus' name we pray.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.632
OTHERS:
Amen.

04:33.670 --> 04:34.898
Thank you, Pastor.

04:34.940 --> 04:38.068
We are reviewing
IPRA packet log

04:38.110 --> 04:40.578
number 166616.

04:40.610 --> 04:44.068
Officer-involved shooting
at the Addison El platform.

04:44.110 --> 04:45.805
You'll find your packet

04:45.850 --> 04:46.919
in front of you.

04:46.950 --> 04:47.917
As blue ribbon

04:47.950 --> 04:49.918
panel chair,
I would ask

04:49.950 --> 04:51.588
for standard five-minute
questioning periods

04:51.620 --> 04:52.757
for all panelists.

04:52.790 --> 04:54.610
All those in favor?

04:54.660 --> 04:56.855
OTHERS:
Aye.
All those opposed?

04:56.890 --> 04:58.687
Motion passes.
I would also advise

04:58.730 --> 05:01.528
that we confine
the witness list to
the four witnesses

05:01.560 --> 05:03.425
in the IPRA report.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.062
All those in favor?
OTHERS:
Aye.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.328
All those opposed?

05:06.370 --> 05:07.462
Good.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.060
Well, then I would suggest
we call our ﬁrst witness.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.999
How's it going down
there, Mrs. Florrick?

05:13.040 --> 05:15.508
Just trying to catch up.

05:15.540 --> 05:16.700
You're doing just fine.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.706
MAN:
We were working undercover.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.048
There were a series of holdups,
female passengers

05:21.080 --> 05:22.889
at North Side El platforms.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.048
Officer Trina Coffey and myself
were tasked with a decoy detail.

05:26.090 --> 05:27.352
And you came across

05:27.390 --> 05:28.948
a perp?
Yes.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.389
A two-time felon.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.625
He tried to hold up
Officer Coffey.

05:32.660 --> 05:36.699
We announced ourselves
as police officers,
pulled our firearms,

05:36.730 --> 05:39.767
threw him to the ground,
and that's when I saw...

05:39.800 --> 05:43.702
at the end of the platform,
a man advancing towards us
with a handgun.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.059
MIKE:
And this was
the victim,

05:45.110 --> 05:48.079
Roland Masters?
I yelled "gun."

05:48.110 --> 05:49.600
My partner...

05:49.650 --> 05:52.574
uh, Officer Coffey...

05:52.620 --> 05:55.009
turned and fired on the...

05:55.050 --> 05:57.041
on Mr. Masters.

05:57.090 --> 06:01.982
MIKE:
And unfortunately, Mr. Masters
saw your undercover clothes

06:02.020 --> 06:05.023
and thought you were
trying to mug this thief.
Yes.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.392
He was being
a Good Samaritan.
But you thought

06:07.430 --> 06:09.466
he was another perp
trying to shoot you.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.392
Thank you, Officer.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.692
I'm sorry you have
to go through this.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.139
Any questions,
Your Honor Dunaway?

06:16.170 --> 06:18.934
Yes, uh, just one.

06:18.970 --> 06:21.700
You identified yourselves
as police officers?

06:21.740 --> 06:23.901
Yes.
So why do
you think

06:23.950 --> 06:25.474
the victim kept
advancing on you?

06:25.510 --> 06:28.172
My guess is, he didn't hear us.

06:28.220 --> 06:31.109
There was an express train
on the facing track.

06:31.150 --> 06:33.755
He probably didn't
hear us over the noise.

06:33.790 --> 06:35.087
Thank you, Officer.
Nothing else.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.189
Your Honor Winter,
five minutes.

06:36.220 --> 06:37.528
No questions.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.027
Mr. Adams,
five minutes.

06:39.060 --> 06:40.459
No questions.
Mr. Danforth?

06:40.500 --> 06:41.592
DANFORTH:
Nothing.

06:41.630 --> 06:43.769
Pastor Damon,
five minutes.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.721
No, I'm fine.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.533
Mrs. Florrick, five minutes.

06:46.570 --> 06:48.128
I...

06:53.780 --> 06:55.736
No questions.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.998
DIANE:
All by a show of hands?

07:00.650 --> 07:02.072
Eight votes.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.088
The motion to
remove Will Gardner

07:04.120 --> 07:07.214
from name partnership
and replace him with
David Lee also fails.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.649
This is all backward--
we should vote Will out,

07:09.690 --> 07:10.952
then vote for a replacement.

07:10.990 --> 07:12.753
That's not how
we do things here.
Because you

07:12.800 --> 07:14.495
know it'll pass.
This firm is limping

07:14.530 --> 07:16.498
without a full lawyer
as a fellow _name
partner, Diane.

07:16.530 --> 07:18.498
You just want to have
an equal vote with her.

07:18.530 --> 07:20.930
I want there to be
a balance of power
at the top.

07:20.970 --> 07:22.835
Excuse me, gentlemen,
unless you have more business...

07:22.870 --> 07:23.905
ELI:
It's my understanding
Mr. Gardner's

07:23.940 --> 07:26.534
still a profit participant
while suspended

07:26.580 --> 07:28.935
as a lawyer.
I move that...

07:28.980 --> 07:32.199
Could someone put that
into motion words for me?

07:32.250 --> 07:35.970
JULIUS:
I move that Will be
precluded from sharing
in any firm revenues

07:36.020 --> 07:38.887
during the time
in which he_ is not
actively practicmg law.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.514
I second.
Call the question.
WILL: Diane, can I have a word.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.778
No.
A name partner
is asking

07:43.830 --> 07:44.888
for a word.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.898
You can have your
vote afterward.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.768
WILL: _
Are they watching us?

07:50.800 --> 07:51.721
Oh, yeah.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.692
How am I looking?

07:53.740 --> 07:54.832
Little more worried.

07:55.870 --> 07:57.167
(groans)

07:57.210 --> 07:59.735
Do you think this'll
appease them,

07:59.780 --> 08:01.202
me giving up
my profits?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.777
They're still coming
after your seat.

08:03.810 --> 08:06.677
As long as the three
are divided, I'm fine.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.608
Pretty soon they're
gonna figure that out.

08:08.650 --> 08:11.084
Ronnie, I'm sorry
for your loss,

08:11.120 --> 08:14.556
but can you help us
out here at all?

08:14.590 --> 08:17.957
It's just, you were
the only witness
on the platform.

08:17.990 --> 08:20.959
You saw your father
being shot?

08:22.300 --> 08:23.790
Did he hear

08:23.830 --> 08:25.718
the police
announce themselves?

08:27.070 --> 08:29.561
My dad...

08:29.610 --> 08:32.534
he helped everyone.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.673
Your dad helped everyone,
is that what you said?

08:34.710 --> 08:35.972
Didn't matter

08:36.010 --> 08:38.570
who you were.

08:38.610 --> 08:39.918
Anybody.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.544
He'd give you money...

08:42.590 --> 08:44.911
(trembling):
he'd...

08:46.090 --> 08:47.887
Pastor.

08:50.260 --> 08:51.887
Son...

08:53.830 --> 08:56.025
I am so sorry,

08:56.060 --> 08:58.290
but the best way
to honor your father

08:58.330 --> 09:00.139
is to help us here.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.809
Did you hear
the policeman

09:02.840 --> 09:04.933
yelling, "Police"?

09:05.970 --> 09:07.972
You didn't?

09:08.010 --> 09:09.739
It was too noisy to hear?

09:16.690 --> 09:19.147
Pete, do you have anything?
Five minutes.

09:19.190 --> 09:20.316
DUNAWAY:
Nothing here.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.918
MIKE:
Harvey?
No questions.

09:21.960 --> 09:22.927
Eric?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.655
I'm good.
Russ, any questions?

09:24.690 --> 09:27.227
Nothing.
Mrs. Florrick?

09:27.260 --> 09:29.057
Ronnie,

09:29.100 --> 09:31.989
Officer Zimmerman
said that there was

09:32.030 --> 09:35.033
an express train running
on the facing track,

09:35.070 --> 09:38.130
and he thought that's why
you and your dad didn't hear--

09:38.170 --> 09:40.673
is that what happened?

09:40.710 --> 09:41.904
I know it's tough

09:41.940 --> 09:44.204
to be here, I know.

09:45.910 --> 09:48.174
But this is about your dad,

09:48.220 --> 09:51.109
so... tell me, just me.

09:55.390 --> 09:57.654
Is that what happened?

10:00.260 --> 10:01.898
No.

10:01.930 --> 10:04.967
That's not why you didn't hear?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.831
Then why didn't you?

10:06.870 --> 10:08.667
Because...

10:08.700 --> 10:10.736
they didn't say anything.

10:10.770 --> 10:14.729
ALICIA:
The undercover officers
didn't say anything?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.407
But you wouldn't
have heard, anyway,

10:16.440 --> 10:18.305
because of the passing train.

10:18.350 --> 10:19.817
No, no.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.875
You could hear everything.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.342
There wasn't
any n0ise.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.119
Except the passing train.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.856
There was a train
that stopped.

10:26.890 --> 10:29.882
It blocked out the
sound, but the cops...

10:29.930 --> 10:33.127
the cops didn't
say a thing.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.355
They just...

10:35.400 --> 10:37.163
(trembling breath)

10:42.300 --> 10:44.359
My dad...

10:44.410 --> 10:47.072
he went over to help...

10:48.310 --> 10:50.801
...and they shot him.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.773
They killed him.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.015
And no one...

10:58.050 --> 11:00.883
no one wants
to believe me.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.097
Good work.

11:07.130 --> 11:08.392
See you tomorrow.
Tomorrow, huh?

11:08.430 --> 11:09.397
You bet.

11:09.430 --> 11:12.297
(low chattering)

11:12.330 --> 11:14.161
Mrs. Florrick.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.064
Hi.
Your Honor.

11:15.100 --> 11:18.160
I'm out of the robes
so just Pete here.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.303
You don't need to impress us.

11:20.340 --> 11:21.807
I don't?

11:21.840 --> 11:24.001
You're here.
You have a seat
at the table.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.779
That's impressing
us enough.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.311
You don't need to be clever.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.045
Oh, I didn't think I was.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.048
Your questioning.
Everybody new to the panel

11:31.090 --> 11:33.012
thinks they're gonna
reinvent the wheel.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.186
You don't have to.

11:34.220 --> 11:37.724
It's a wheel,
it works fine.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.422
Sorry I'm late.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.849
You didn't need me in there?
0.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.458
It went pretty fast.
They said, "no."

12:15.500 --> 12:17.388
They want the
asking price.

12:17.430 --> 12:19.830
Did you tell them I could
offer a quick closing date?

12:19.870 --> 12:21.235
Yeah. They wouldn't budge.

12:21.270 --> 12:23.204
I can't do higher.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.458
I can't do the down payment.

12:25.510 --> 12:27.205
There's something you can try.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.208
It sometimes works.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.208
What's that?
You can write a letter.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.343
Personal stationery,
handwrite it.

12:33.380 --> 12:36.247
Tell her what it would
mean to move back in.
Her?

12:36.280 --> 12:37.247
Gilda, the wife.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.985
I think she's the one
making the decisions.

12:39.020 --> 12:41.250
You have an advantage
over the other offers;

12:41.290 --> 12:44.179
you lived here.

12:48.830 --> 12:51.321
What the house means to me.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.858
WINTER:
So, Officer Coffey,

13:14.890 --> 13:16.858
what happened next?

13:16.890 --> 13:18.255
I heard my partner
yell, "gun."

13:18.290 --> 13:20.292
I spun around and saw
a man charging at us.

13:20.330 --> 13:21.854
WINTER:
And that's

13:21.900 --> 13:22.924
why you fired?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.119
COFFE_Y:
Yes, Sir.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.422
WINTER: Thank you, ma'am.
I'm finished.

13:26.470 --> 13:27.562
Pastor Damon, five minutes.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.830
No. I'm, I'm fine.

13:29.870 --> 13:31.007
Judge Dunaway?
Nothing from me, Mike.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.109
Russ?
Nothing.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.028
MIKE: E_ric?
No questions.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.479
Mrs. Florrick? Five minutes?

13:35.510 --> 13:36.841
Yes, thank you.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.007
You remember yelling
you were police officers

13:39.050 --> 13:40.472
when you threw the arrestee
to the ground?

13:40.520 --> 13:41.976
Yes, ma'am.
And you remember

13:42.020 --> 13:43.339
an express train

13:43.390 --> 13:46.018
racing through the station
when you yelled "police"?

13:46.050 --> 13:48.382
Yes, ma'am, that's
why the victim didn't hear us.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.126
Was there a stopped train
on your track?

13:50.160 --> 13:52.151
Yes, ma'am,
the 11:35 red line.

13:52.190 --> 13:53.293
So...

13:53.330 --> 13:56.424
didn't it block out the noise
of the passing train?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.399
I-I don't understand, ma'am.

13:59.430 --> 14:00.533
Didn't the parked train

14:00.570 --> 14:02.390
block the noise of
the passing train?

14:02.440 --> 14:04.362
No.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.502
That's odd.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.178
Because I was there last night

14:07.210 --> 14:08.336
and I could hear...

14:08.380 --> 14:09.574
Wait a minute...
Mrs. Florrick.

14:09.610 --> 14:10.645
Yes?

14:10.680 --> 14:13.410
(scoffs)
That is not your position.

14:15.450 --> 14:18.578
Let's move this panel
into executive session, please.

14:18.620 --> 14:19.951
Officer Coffey,

14:19.990 --> 14:22.185
we'll call you back
in a few minutes.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.357
I wasn't there to investigate.

14:25.390 --> 14:27.893
You just happened to be in that
particular station last night?

14:27.930 --> 14:29.557
Yes.
Mr. Chairman,

14:29.600 --> 14:32.228
I move that the panel
censure Mrs. Florrick.

14:32.270 --> 14:33.362
DANFORTH: Second.
Excuse me.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.334
I'm not sure
what I've done wrong.

14:35.370 --> 14:37.509
You went out and investigated.
I was there, I observed.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.667
Don't interrupt me.
We are like a jury.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.507
A jury
can't investigate.

14:41.540 --> 14:42.234
We're not the cops, honey.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.577
MIKE:
It's true, Mrs. Florrick.

14:43.610 --> 14:45.077
There's nothing
in the rules exactly

14:45.110 --> 14:46.304
preventing us
from investigating,

14:46.350 --> 14:48.170
but it's traditional
that our review

14:48.220 --> 14:50.415
stick to the evidence on hand.

14:50.450 --> 14:51.678
I didn't know that.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.416
As you know, I am new to this.

14:58.090 --> 14:59.580
Good.

14:59.630 --> 15:01.928
Well, I would advise
against a censure.

15:01.960 --> 15:02.995
But, now

15:03.030 --> 15:04.463
that we're all on the same page,

15:04.500 --> 15:05.899
shall we break for lunch?

15:08.300 --> 15:10.461
I am so sorry.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.159
I was held up.

15:12.210 --> 15:13.404
I'm sorry, Ms. Sharma.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.976
That's quite all right,
Mrs. Florrick.

15:15.010 --> 15:17.308
It gave us time
to get acquainted.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.648
Uh, Mr. Lesher, is it?

15:19.680 --> 15:21.113
Yes.

15:21.150 --> 15:22.412
This is Mr. Finerman
and Mr. Hark.

15:22.450 --> 15:24.418
Welcome to the Internal
Revenue Serwce.

15:24.450 --> 15:25.280
We've been reviewing your

15:25.320 --> 15:27.288
petition for an Offer
and Compromise.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.254
I'm afraid we need
more information.
Okay, uh, well,

15:29.290 --> 15:30.621
why don't you tell us
in greater detail

15:30.660 --> 15:33.220
what it is you need,
and we'll be glad to supply it.

15:33.260 --> 15:34.693
The exact names
of Ms. Sharma's employers

15:34.730 --> 15:36.288
and the nature
of the employment.

15:36.330 --> 15:37.558
Actually, that is
in our petition.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.659
I have more copies,
if you need them.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.099
No, no, no.
We reviewed it.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.334
It's very vague.

15:42.370 --> 15:43.530
Employment is listed

15:43.570 --> 15:46.061
as "research"
or "background check."

15:46.110 --> 15:47.475
We need more specifics.

15:47.510 --> 15:48.169
Why?

15:48.210 --> 15:50.405
Why do we need more specifics?

15:50.450 --> 15:51.542
Yes.

15:51.580 --> 15:54.117
I don't think we need
to explain that.

15:54.150 --> 15:55.447
ALICIA: Ms. Sharma is
not being accused

15:55.480 --> 15:59.109
of breaking any laws or
exploiting any loopholes.

15:59.150 --> 16:01.357
She was a passive recipient
of a check that you believe

16:01.390 --> 16:03.483
came from a dummy
account, that's all.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.055
That does not open her up
to a fishing expedition.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.352
Now we have come
here in good faith

16:07.400 --> 16:09.129
to Offer and Compromise.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.297
We did not come here

16:10.330 --> 16:12.025
to be shaken down
for more information.

16:12.070 --> 16:14.698
We are not in the business
of shaking down,

16:14.740 --> 16:16.469
but we need more
speCIfic information

16:16.500 --> 16:18.138
as to the exact nature...

16:18.170 --> 16:19.432
What was that about?

16:19.470 --> 16:22.177
Why even call us in
if they weren't gonna
Offer and Compromise?

16:22.210 --> 16:23.404
You got a little
hot in there.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.543
I did. I seem to be
banging my head against

16:25.580 --> 16:26.649
the bureaucratic
wall today,

16:26.680 --> 16:29.171
and I don't like my time
wasted in pointless meetings.

16:29.220 --> 16:31.541
Alicia, that wasn't
the meeting.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.148
It wasn't?
What do you mean?

16:33.190 --> 16:35.511
The laptop on the desk--
someone was watching us.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.027
VVho?

16:37.060 --> 16:38.379
I have no idea, but...

16:38.430 --> 16:40.352
they want
something from me.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.162
If you want something from us,
you call my office.

16:52.210 --> 16:53.734
Stop playing through
intermediaries.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.478
I lost my house.
I'm using it.

17:07.220 --> 17:10.053
Dear Gilda,

17:10.090 --> 17:11.489
As you probably know...

17:14.300 --> 17:16.598
...I lived in your house
before you.

17:16.630 --> 17:18.598
I saw my children
grow up there.

17:18.630 --> 17:21.531
(child laughing)
I saw...

17:22.540 --> 17:25.668
(laughter continues)

17:28.640 --> 17:30.642
(child laughing)

17:33.420 --> 17:35.308
(shouts happily)
I'm gonna get you!

17:35.350 --> 17:36.612
(laughing)
I'm gonna get you!

17:39.520 --> 17:41.181
I saw my daughter walk

17:41.220 --> 17:42.619
for the first time there.

17:43.660 --> 17:46.151
I saw...

17:52.730 --> 17:55.563
WOMAN (over TV):
Florrick refused to address

17:55.600 --> 17:57.739
troubling allegations
that he abused his office

17:57.770 --> 18:00.477
in order to protect
his powerful friends.

18:00.510 --> 18:02.705
Florrick denied
that he accepted sexual...

18:04.880 --> 18:07.075
(door opening)

18:18.690 --> 18:21.158
(sighs)

18:22.400 --> 18:24.618
JULIUS:
What are you saying?

18:24.670 --> 18:27.537
What I'm saying
is that was a charade yesterday.

18:27.570 --> 18:29.458
Will knew we were
gonna to strip him

18:29.500 --> 18:30.330
of his profit participation,

18:30.370 --> 18:31.860
and they made it
look like a struggle.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.275
To what end?

18:33.310 --> 18:35.175
To throw us a bone.

18:35.210 --> 18:38.179
So Will can stay in his
seat as name partner.

18:38.210 --> 18:40.349
This is like everything
else: it's about power.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.416
And we are making
it easy on them.

18:42.450 --> 18:43.712
Okay.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.217
I'm listening.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.150
You want Will's seat,

18:47.190 --> 18:49.215
David Lee wants Will's seat,

18:49.260 --> 18:50.727
and I want Will's seat.

18:50.760 --> 18:51.749
One of us

18:51.790 --> 18:54.156
has to give, or they benefit
from our squabble.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.292
Then give.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.820
I already asked you
to vote for me.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.428
We flip a coin.

18:59.470 --> 19:01.768
I win, you get your
votes to support me.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.200
You win...
I get your votes.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.231
Uh, uh, uh.

19:09.610 --> 19:10.941
Honor among thieves.

19:10.980 --> 19:13.448
Heads.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.727
Hey, Howard.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.251
I can't understand why
I can't get the corner office.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.655
It's the closest one
to the bathroom.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.520
I don't decide that.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.925
You'll have to talk to Diane.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.323
Whatever happened
to seniority?

19:32.370 --> 19:34.429
You on the Cuesta case?
Am I?

19:34.470 --> 19:35.732
No, I'm suspended.

19:35.770 --> 19:38.307
I'm not on any case.
Oh, that's right.

19:38.340 --> 19:39.500
Just you and me.

19:39.540 --> 19:40.905
We're the only ones
not working.

19:40.940 --> 19:43.909
You got any good
porn sites?

19:45.810 --> 19:47.346
I'm the IPRA investigator,
Forrest Burke.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.268
DUNAWAY:
We've read your
report, Mr. Burke,

19:49.320 --> 19:50.617
arguing that the
allegation's not supported

19:50.650 --> 19:52.948
by sufficient evidence.

19:52.990 --> 19:55.515
There have been questions
here about the, um,

19:55.560 --> 19:58.222
the noise factor
on the platform.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.557
Could you speak to that?

19:59.590 --> 20:00.989
BURKE:
Well, I would expect
some dispute.

20:01.030 --> 20:03.521
This was an encounter that
lasted eight seconds.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.424
And I've found that people

20:05.470 --> 20:07.563
experience sound and sight
radically differently

20:07.600 --> 20:09.431
when there are
chaotic conditions.

20:09.470 --> 20:11.859
Nothing further from me, Mike.

20:11.910 --> 20:12.934
Harvey, anything?

20:12.970 --> 20:15.438
Why don't we just jump
right down to Mrs. Florrick?

20:15.480 --> 20:17.368
See if she has anything.
Yes.

20:17.410 --> 20:18.547
Thank you.
Just a few questions.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.445
This gun the Good
Samaritan had...

20:20.480 --> 20:21.947
A Colt

20:21.980 --> 20:24.016
Double Eagle Commander pistol.
Yes.

20:24.050 --> 20:25.688
I saw in your report
that you checked

20:25.720 --> 20:27.654
to see if it had been
used in other crimes.

20:27.690 --> 20:28.509
Yes, it's standard.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.016
And it had been used
in another crime.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.857
Or, at least,
the ballistics matched.

20:31.890 --> 20:34.290
Yes. There was
a jewelry store robbery

20:34.330 --> 20:35.319
two years earlier.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.520
The culprit was never
apprehended,

20:36.560 --> 20:38.027
but he or she
did fire off

20:38.070 --> 20:40.766
one round, and the recovered
shell matched this gun.

20:40.800 --> 20:41.994
And you didn't

20:42.040 --> 20:43.667
suspect the Good Samaritan?
No.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.530
Guns get bought and sold
on the street all the time.

20:45.570 --> 20:47.606
So, this jewelry store hold up

20:47.640 --> 20:50.279
from two years earlier,

20:50.310 --> 20:51.777
did you take note of who

20:51.810 --> 20:54.040
the supervising officer
was at the scene?

20:54.080 --> 20:55.968
Did I take note?

20:56.020 --> 20:57.044
No. Why?

20:57.080 --> 20:58.741
Officer Zimmerman,

20:58.790 --> 21:01.611
the undercover officer
was the superVISIng cop...

21:01.660 --> 21:03.548
Mrs. Florrick,
that is out of line.

21:03.590 --> 21:04.557
What? I don't get it.
I just

21:04.590 --> 21:06.558
find it curious.
You're suggesting
that the gun

21:06.590 --> 21:07.625
was a drop gun.

21:07.660 --> 21:09.491
That Officer
Zimmerman

21:09.530 --> 21:11.623
retrieved it from the jewelry
robbery and planted it...

21:11.670 --> 21:12.898
I'm merely asking
a question.

21:12.930 --> 21:15.364
In your review,
did you look...

21:15.400 --> 21:16.435
Mrs. Florrick,
your five minutes are up.

21:16.470 --> 21:17.869
They're... Excuse me,

21:17.910 --> 21:20.834
but I spent
two of those minutes arguing.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.404
That was your choice.
Let's move on.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.340
Harvey, you've got
five minutes. Any questions?

21:24.380 --> 21:25.404
WINTER:
I do not.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.474
MIKE:
Mr. Adams?

21:26.510 --> 21:27.545
ADAMS:
Nothing here.

21:27.580 --> 21:28.569
MIKE:
Mr. Danforth?

21:28.620 --> 21:29.678
DANFORTH:
I'm good, Mike.

21:29.720 --> 21:30.914
MIKE:
Pastor Damon,

21:30.950 --> 21:32.838
any questions?
No, thank you.

21:32.890 --> 21:34.881
But...

21:34.920 --> 21:37.423
I'm giving my five minutes
to Mrs. Florrick.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.883
What? You can't...
We've done it before.

21:39.930 --> 21:42.421
I'm giving

21:42.460 --> 21:44.428
my five minutes
to Mrs. Florrick.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.825
Please continue, ma'am.

21:48.870 --> 21:50.599
Have there been other times

21:50.640 --> 21:53.438
where officers
have used drop guns?

21:56.140 --> 21:57.539
Do you know
how ridiculous that is--

21:57.580 --> 21:59.878
a cop would hold onto
that gun for two years?

21:59.910 --> 22:01.719
I'm just asking a question.
No, you're not.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.411
Let's not play innocent,
Mrs. Florrick.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.042
You're trying to turn this
into something.

22:05.090 --> 22:06.910
No, I'm trying to find out...

22:06.950 --> 22:09.555
This blows up into a race riot,
and it's on your head.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.421
Excuse me?
You heard me.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.997
White officer,
a black victim-- come on.

22:15.030 --> 22:17.123
That should have nothing
to do with this.
And yet it does.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.821
Race is here.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.838
And you want to kick
that hornet's nest?

22:22.470 --> 22:24.768
Ask Diane what it
looks like to piss off

22:24.810 --> 22:26.402
judges like this.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.408
People like this.

22:43.020 --> 22:44.829
ALICIA:
Dear Gilda, I didn't know

22:44.860 --> 22:46.623
how to write this letter

22:46.660 --> 22:47.922
till I went
to your open house.

22:55.870 --> 22:57.167
(Peter chuckling)

22:57.200 --> 22:58.701
PETER:
See?

22:58.740 --> 23:00.105
Look at that.

23:00.140 --> 23:02.608
Now you're a
movie star.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.505
Grace Florrick,

23:04.550 --> 23:06.609
big Hollywood
movie star.

23:06.650 --> 23:08.572
Cool!
Oh, look at this.

23:08.620 --> 23:09.814
It's Grace Kelly.

23:09.850 --> 23:10.839
(chuckling)

23:10.890 --> 23:13.711
I should have got you
to do this a long time ago.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.557
Yeah, you just like
me dirty and sweaty!

23:15.590 --> 23:16.784
No!

23:16.820 --> 23:18.549
(squealing laughter)

23:18.590 --> 23:20.729
(roaring playfully)

23:29.540 --> 23:31.667
*

23:31.710 --> 23:33.200
ALICIA:
Listen to me.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.674
People are going to say a lot
of things about your dad.

23:35.710 --> 23:36.904
GRACE:
Are they true?

23:36.940 --> 23:38.544
Doesn't matter
if they're true.

23:38.580 --> 23:40.639
Does to me.
It does to Mom.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.216
ALICIA:
Okay, your dad loves you.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.717
He loves you so much.

23:43.750 --> 23:47.049
But whatever you have
to say about your dad,

23:47.090 --> 23:49.979
you say it here.

23:50.020 --> 23:51.681
Now, to me.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.789
You don't say it
to anyone else, okay?

23:56.730 --> 23:58.869
(thunder rumbling softly)

24:02.040 --> 24:05.032
ALICIA:
See? Isn't this better
than camping?

24:05.070 --> 24:06.765
You're such
a Girl Scout.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.675
Yes, I am.

24:08.710 --> 24:11.577
But you're still going
to have to protect me.

24:11.610 --> 24:13.100
I'm so scared
of lightning.

24:13.150 --> 24:14.742
(both laughing)

24:14.780 --> 24:16.577
Wait. Did hear that?

24:16.620 --> 24:17.917
What?
(howls)

24:17.950 --> 24:19.781
Not funny. Not funny.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.526
ALICIA:
I know you have
no reason to choose

24:27.560 --> 24:30.723
my offer over others,
but just know

24:30.770 --> 24:32.123
you will not find
a more grateful

24:32.170 --> 24:34.730
or loving occupant
of your house.

24:39.170 --> 24:41.001
He said that?
ALICIA:
Yes.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.905
He said there
would be consequences

24:42.940 --> 24:44.908
for questioning more.

24:44.950 --> 24:46.542
Yeah, it sounds
like Mike

24:46.580 --> 24:48.138
confusing his carrots
with his sticks.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.068
But you've been investigating
on your own?

24:51.120 --> 24:52.747
Who told you?

24:52.790 --> 24:53.984
Who_told me _
you were investigating?

24:54.020 --> 24:55.556
Someone on the panel.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.581
But that's confidential.
They broke confidentiality.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.586
So have you, by relating
your conversation with Mike.

24:59.630 --> 25:00.449
No.

25:00.490 --> 25:02.299
That_was after
the sessmn was over.

25:02.330 --> 25:03.968
Look, you want to
know what to do?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.763
You're on the blue ribbon panel
to review the investigation.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.767
That's what you do.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.665
You don't
pull punches.

25:10.710 --> 25:11.938
Well, it's up to you.

25:11.970 --> 25:13.801
I mean,
you have a seat at the table.

25:13.840 --> 25:16.832
That means more responsibility
and consequences.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.643
Can they hurt
your career?

25:18.680 --> 25:19.908
Yes.

25:19.950 --> 25:21.815
You have to weigh that.

25:22.850 --> 25:25.683
Okay. Thank you.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.119
Would you like me
to close the door?

25:27.150 --> 25:28.253
Yes.

25:33.060 --> 25:34.618
(door closes)

25:35.830 --> 25:37.627
So they're going to tax us?

25:37.670 --> 25:38.796
Yep.

25:38.830 --> 25:39.660
Judges Dunaway and Winter.

25:39.700 --> 25:41.258
We have two cases
in front of them.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.307
Alicia has to do her best.

25:46.340 --> 25:49.878
It's easy to be idealistic
on the sidelines, isn't it?

25:49.910 --> 25:51.969
Yeah, that's me--
Peace Prize material.

25:52.010 --> 25:54.149
And, uh, you seem
to have a new friend.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.643
Yeah.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.146
Early bird special.

25:59.190 --> 26:00.987
He turned me on to it.

26:01.020 --> 26:02.658
It's quite a deal.

26:03.690 --> 26:05.851
ALICIA:
Hello?

26:05.890 --> 26:07.858
Hi.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.299
Lana Delaney.

26:09.330 --> 26:11.764
I'm with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

26:12.970 --> 26:14.198
You suggested I contact you.

26:15.940 --> 26:18.033
"Stop playing
through intermediaries."

26:18.070 --> 26:20.265
Oh, right.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.132
Hi.

26:23.180 --> 26:25.341
I thought you
would call first.

26:25.380 --> 26:27.302
Yes, I thought I would, too.

26:27.350 --> 26:29.045
Then I decided against it.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.342
So...

26:31.390 --> 26:33.608
KaHnda?
Yes, Kalinda.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.616
What is the nature
of this investigation?

26:35.660 --> 26:37.082
I don't know.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.181
You don't know?

26:40.230 --> 26:41.891
Yes.

26:41.930 --> 26:43.659
Sometimes I just get an itch.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.833
Okay, so I'm, um... I'm sorry.

26:47.870 --> 26:48.962
What was your name again?

26:49.000 --> 26:52.401
Lana Delaney.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.738
You guys represent
Lemond Bishop, don't you?

26:56.710 --> 26:58.007
Oh.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.802
So that's what this is about--
Lemond Bishop?

26:59.850 --> 27:01.670
No. I'm just asking a question.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.244
Yes, we represent him.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.986
And has
Kalinda Sharma

27:05.020 --> 27:07.614
ever done freelance
work for him?

27:09.090 --> 27:10.751
Do you have proof that she has?

27:11.960 --> 27:13.928
How long have you known Kalinda?

27:13.960 --> 27:15.655
Why?
Just curious.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.053
You're friends, aren't you?

27:20.030 --> 27:23.261
You know, I think
you should call first,

27:23.300 --> 27:27.168
Ms. Delaney, the next time
you want to drop by my office.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.030
Then we can get everything
on the record.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.173
Okay.

27:32.210 --> 27:35.748
Tell Kalinda hi for me.

27:46.890 --> 27:49.256
Mr. Burke?
Mrs. Florrick,
uh, hello.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.892
I'm sorry to come here
without an appointment.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.329
(cell phone ringing)
Oh, just a sec.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.769
I'm sorry, Mr. Burke.
Hello?

27:53.800 --> 27:54.994
GILDA:
My gosh, what an amazing letter.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.258
I was crying!

27:57.300 --> 27:58.801
Uh... Gilda?

27:58.840 --> 27:59.864
Yes. Tears!

27:59.910 --> 28:01.138
It had me bawling.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.204
I remember my first house.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.049
It was exactly like that.
Uh, Kalinda, wait a sec.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.877
I'm so sorry, Mr. Burke.
I just don't have
that much time.

28:05.910 --> 28:07.275
I'm on lunch break.

28:07.310 --> 28:08.948
Of course, we'll consider
your offer, Mrs. Florrick.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.345
Oh, thank you.

28:10.380 --> 28:12.018
I have two kids, too.

28:12.050 --> 28:13.017
I come from a big family,

28:13.050 --> 28:15.359
and I always told myself,
"Listen to moms."

28:15.390 --> 28:16.982
Oh, I'm so glad,
because I wasn't...

28:17.020 --> 28:17.987
I wasn't sure
I was d0ing

28:18.030 --> 28:19.884
the right thing by
writing the letter and...

28:19.930 --> 28:22.251
Um, Kalinda, the FBI
was here for you.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.768
For me? Who?
Agent Delaney.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.324
It was definitely
the right thing to do.

28:26.370 --> 28:28.930
In fact, I want you to know
we have a bigger offer--

28:28.970 --> 28:30.938
someone _who offered
our asking price--

28:30.970 --> 28:32.858
but I'd rather
you have the house.

28:32.910 --> 28:34.775
Oh, I... well, I'm so thrilled
to hear that.

28:34.810 --> 28:35.902
Mrs. Florrick.

28:35.940 --> 28:37.805
I checked the drop gun.
I checked what you mentioned.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.819
So we're giving you a chance
to top their offer.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.738
Not even by that much;
just a little.

28:42.780 --> 28:44.281
What?

28:44.320 --> 28:46.288
We so want you
to have the house.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.982
We just need you
to top the offer we have.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.510
Okay. Thank you.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.152
So we'll expect your call?

28:52.190 --> 28:54.192
Yep. Good-bye.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.427
What did you need,
Mr. Burke?

28:59.470 --> 29:00.892
MIKE:
And with that, I think

29:00.940 --> 29:03.067
we have heard the lion's share
of the evidence,

29:03.100 --> 29:04.761
so unless there
are any more motions...

29:04.810 --> 29:06.129
ALICIA: There is one,
sir-- Mr. Chair.

29:06.170 --> 29:09.970
I move that we recall
Investigator Forrest Burke.

29:10.010 --> 29:11.978
We've already heard from him,
Mrs. Florrick.

29:12.010 --> 29:14.319
Yes, but it is my understanding
that he has new evidence.

29:14.350 --> 29:15.977
DU NAWAY:
Really?

29:16.020 --> 29:18.488
And how did it become
your understanding?

29:18.520 --> 29:20.078
He came to my workplace.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.985
He said the chair rejected

29:22.020 --> 29:23.920
his request
to testify here again.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.494
First of all,
Mrs. Florrick,

29:28.530 --> 29:30.122
you are far out of line here.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.866
In fact, I don't even think
there is a line...

29:31.900 --> 29:33.094
But is it true?
Mr. Burke

29:33.130 --> 29:34.791
did come to me and asked
if we needed

29:34.840 --> 29:36.489
more from him,
and I said we did not.

29:36.540 --> 29:38.531
He discovered Officer Zimmerman
took a gun

29:38.570 --> 29:40.834
from the jewelry story robbery
into evidence,

29:40.880 --> 29:42.177
but never inventoried it.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.098
Mrs. Florrick,
that is not yours to assert.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.378
Correct. It is Mr. Burke's.

29:45.410 --> 29:46.968
We have
heard enough

29:47.010 --> 29:47.977
from Mr. Burke.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.840
I move that we recall.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.510
Okay, fine.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.118
That's the way we
do things here.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.082
All those in favor of
Mrs. Florrick's motion

29:58.130 --> 30:01.122
to recall Mr. Burke, please
signify by saying, "Aye."

30:01.160 --> 30:03.196
Aye.

30:04.230 --> 30:05.458
Aye.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.990
Five to two.

30:07.030 --> 30:09.294
Unfortunately,
you need a majority.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.001
Aye.

30:13.410 --> 30:15.173
I'm here to determine the truth.

30:15.210 --> 30:18.373
I can't do that _
unless I listen to everything.

30:19.950 --> 30:21.872
ADAMS:
Aye.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.286
DAN FORTH:
Aye.

30:26.550 --> 30:28.415
HOWARD:
I'm not bitter.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.859
Bitterness is for losers.

30:29.890 --> 30:32.154
You tell me--
why should I

30:32.190 --> 30:33.521
give someone else
a leg up, huh?

30:33.560 --> 30:35.050
I see you're busy here.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.294
No, no.
David, what do you need?

30:36.330 --> 30:37.354
Howard, do you mind?

30:37.400 --> 30:38.469
Oh, sure.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.626
Push me here,
push me there.

30:39.670 --> 30:41.968
Right. Take two
steps that way.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.562
Sorry to interrupt
your schmoozing,

30:45.610 --> 30:48.932
but do you know that Diane
is digging this firm's grave

30:48.980 --> 30:50.470
because of
her loyalty to you?

30:50.510 --> 30:52.876
No. I didn't know that.

30:52.910 --> 30:54.241
Will, I always liked you.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.941
I thought you were smart.

30:55.980 --> 30:58.642
_ But this firm _
is not owned by you or Diane,

30:58.690 --> 31:01.079
and she is treating it
like it is.

31:01.120 --> 31:04.920
She's not making smart
business or legal decisions.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.121
And what are
the smart decisions?

31:07.160 --> 31:08.627
She needs help
at the top.

31:08.660 --> 31:11.595
She is overwhelmed,
and she can't ask for help

31:11.630 --> 31:13.564
because she's holding
the spot for you.

31:16.570 --> 31:19.562
You want me to support you
to replace me?

31:19.610 --> 31:22.204
No. I want you to tell Diane

31:22.240 --> 31:26.108
to make smart decisions
not based on loyalty.

31:28.650 --> 31:30.641
(sighs)

31:32.290 --> 31:34.281
(phone ringing)

31:37.620 --> 31:39.121
Hello?

31:39.160 --> 31:40.559
MARINA:
Alicia, I'm so thrilled.

31:40.590 --> 31:42.091
But why didn't you go
through me?

31:42.130 --> 31:43.654
Hi, Marina. What?

31:43.700 --> 31:46.362
Why didn't you do
the sales contract through me?

31:46.400 --> 31:48.334
What sales contract?

31:48.370 --> 31:49.394
For the house.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.668
I saw it cross my desk.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.031
But why did you use Shirley?

31:52.070 --> 31:53.139
I didn't.

31:53.170 --> 31:54.330
I didn't get the house.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.574
I couldn't beat the offer.

31:55.610 --> 31:58.101
Well, I'm looking
at the file right here.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.242
"Florrick."

31:59.280 --> 32:01.669
I mean, how many Florricks
are there?

32:04.290 --> 32:06.508
Two.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.108
Two Florricks.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.980
Oh, I see-- your husband.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.578
That's great.

32:11.630 --> 32:12.654
You got the house.

32:12.690 --> 32:15.329
Congratulations.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.590
Alicia? Hello?

32:19.730 --> 32:22.460
Why are you
doing this?
Doing what?

32:22.500 --> 32:23.535
Holding my
seat for me.

32:24.570 --> 32:26.458
Do you want me not to?

32:26.510 --> 32:28.000
I don't want you holding my seat

32:28.040 --> 32:30.099
out of some misguided
sense of loyalty.

32:30.140 --> 32:31.346
Well, you'd do the same.

32:31.380 --> 32:33.200
No, I wouldn't.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.616
No, you would,
because it's smart.

32:35.650 --> 32:38.744
David Lee, Julius
and Eli are children

32:38.790 --> 32:41.054
who have been told
they can't have a toy,

32:41.090 --> 32:42.557
which_ makes them
want it even more.

32:42.590 --> 32:44.683
But if they got it,
they would just break it,

32:44.730 --> 32:47.324
which is why we have to keep it
out of their reach.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.622
Good.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.729
As long as you're doing it
because it's smart.

32:53.770 --> 32:56.136
Always.

32:56.170 --> 32:59.469
I think Julius
is joining forces with Eli.

32:59.510 --> 33:02.070
Yes, they've requested
another partner vote.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.475
Any ideas?

33:04.510 --> 33:06.501
One.

33:06.550 --> 33:08.438
Really? Well, let's hear it.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.778
Peter, when you get this,
can you call my cell?

33:10.820 --> 33:14.210
I need to talk to you about
something as soon as you can.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.787
I just wish, if accusations
of a drop gun were made,

33:17.820 --> 33:19.128
they'd be made
to my face.

33:19.160 --> 33:22.550
MIKE:
Oh, I wouldn't say they've risen
to the level of accusations.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.363
They're just...
provocative questions.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.129
Now, you were questioned

33:26.170 --> 33:28.468
about a drop gun,
weren't you, Officer?

33:28.500 --> 33:30.058
Yes.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.362
And when was that?

33:31.410 --> 33:33.560
After the IPRA investigation,

33:33.610 --> 33:35.669
I was questioned by the State's
Attorney's office.

33:35.710 --> 33:37.177
By whom...

33:37.210 --> 33:39.804
in the State's
Attorney's office?

33:39.850 --> 33:43.479
ASA Matan Brody and
Deputy ASA Cary Agos.

33:43.520 --> 33:46.080
And they decided
not to prosecute?

33:46.120 --> 33:48.088
Yes, they took
their findings

33:48.120 --> 33:50.054
to the State's
Attorney, Peter Florrick,

33:50.090 --> 33:52.149
and he decided there
wasn't enough to prosecute.

33:52.190 --> 33:54.124
But you could see
why I would take

33:54.160 --> 33:57.789
these charges of a gun drop
with some sense of outrage.

33:57.830 --> 33:58.819
Of course you wanted him back.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.566
So you could lay this at
the feet of my husband,

34:01.600 --> 34:03.090
and I would have
to recuse myself.

34:03.140 --> 34:05.108
Oh, no, you're not going
to recuse yourself.

34:05.140 --> 34:07.301
In fact, I move
this panel deny any recusal.

34:07.340 --> 34:09.205
MIKE:
Mrs. Florrick,
this is not about you.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.572
Your questions have woken up
this panel to its duty.

34:11.610 --> 34:13.168
We're just following
the evidence

34:13.210 --> 34:15.246
where it takes us,
and if it takes us

34:15.280 --> 34:17.111
to an inappropriate decision in
the State's Attorney's office,

34:17.150 --> 34:18.481
so be it.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.249
I move that we
call the ASAs

34:20.290 --> 34:22.281
who questioned
Officer Zimmerman.

34:26.490 --> 34:28.492
(crowd chatter)

34:32.700 --> 34:34.668
There you are.

34:34.700 --> 34:36.463
Here I am.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.502
Oh, you wanted
to get my attention.

34:38.540 --> 34:41.179
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea, Kalinda.

34:41.210 --> 34:44.179
The IRS caught your
little freelance problem.

34:44.210 --> 34:45.802
Ijust picked up the ball.

34:47.610 --> 34:50.841
And where are you carrying
this... ball?

34:50.880 --> 34:54.680
Let's have dinner,
and we can talk.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.881
No. Let's talk here.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.889
No, it's too
crowded here.

34:59.930 --> 35:03.525
I know a nice, intimate
restaurant off Lincoln.

35:03.560 --> 35:07.621
Why don't we do intimate here?

35:09.440 --> 35:12.204
Kalinda, I asked you
to join me at the FBI.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.276
You wouldn't be having
any problems now,

35:14.310 --> 35:17.507
but you decided to stick
it out at Lockhart/Gardner.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.141
Mm. Kalinda!

35:22.320 --> 35:23.309
You have such pretty lips.

35:23.350 --> 35:24.419
What are you doing?

35:24.450 --> 35:25.747
Why do we have to wait
till dinner?

35:25.790 --> 35:28.315
Why not here?
Kalinda.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.713
KALIN DA:
What's wrong?

35:30.920 --> 35:32.285
Kiss me.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.752
Okay, just so you know,

35:33.790 --> 35:36.293
this is not the way you
handle this meeting.

35:36.330 --> 35:38.798
And just so you know,

35:38.830 --> 35:40.718
if you want to talk
about business,

35:40.770 --> 35:42.397
let's talk about business.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.567
If you want to talk
about something else,

35:44.610 --> 35:46.498
we can talk
about something else.

35:46.540 --> 35:49.134
Just don't mix the two.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.882
Yes, we interviewed
Officers Zimmerman and Coffey

36:05.930 --> 36:07.352
two weeks ago?

36:07.390 --> 36:09.255
And you asked them
about the possibility

36:09.300 --> 36:10.426
of a drop gun?

36:10.460 --> 36:12.496
Yes. We discovered

36:12.530 --> 36:14.293
that Officer Zimmerman
had been present

36:14.340 --> 36:15.637
at an earlier crime scene

36:15.670 --> 36:18.309
where no gun had been recovered
and inventoried.

36:18.340 --> 36:19.534
And the worry was

36:19.570 --> 36:21.379
that Officer Zimmerman
had taken the gun

36:21.410 --> 36:23.935
into his own possession
and never inventoried it?

36:23.980 --> 36:25.379
Yes.
But you didn't go

36:25.410 --> 36:27.571
any further
with these accusations?

36:27.610 --> 36:29.669
No.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.746
Um, after consulting with
the State's Attorney...

36:32.790 --> 36:34.382
Peter Florrick?

36:34.420 --> 36:35.717
Yes.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.910
After consulting, we decided

36:37.960 --> 36:40.588
that this was probably
an unfortunate coincidence.

36:40.630 --> 36:42.393
Did the racial makeup
of the officers

36:42.430 --> 36:44.762
and the victim enter
into this decision at all?

36:44.800 --> 36:46.358
Not in my decision.

36:46.400 --> 36:49.563
(laughs)
No. The State's Attorney's
decision?

36:49.600 --> 36:50.589
I can't answer that.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.369
Why?
Well, because

36:52.410 --> 36:54.230
I don't know, Your Honor.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.999
MIKE:
But it would not be in the
interest of the State's Attorney

36:57.040 --> 36:58.132
to pursue a racially-charged
prosecution

36:58.180 --> 37:01.274
on the eve of his announcement
for a run for governor?

37:01.320 --> 37:03.345
I can't answer that,
but I can be offended by that.

37:03.380 --> 37:05.712
Who else was in the meeting,
Deputy ASA Agos?

37:05.750 --> 37:07.240
Uh, just to correct you,

37:07.290 --> 37:08.951
I'm no longer a deputy.

37:08.990 --> 37:10.753
I've been demoted.

37:10.790 --> 37:12.326
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.659
Who else was in the meeting
when you consulted on not

37:15.700 --> 37:17.429
pursuing the drop gun evidence?

37:17.460 --> 37:19.394
Who else? Myself
and the State's Attorney.

37:19.430 --> 37:21.466
Anyone else?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.002
Yes.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.439
And who was that?

37:27.470 --> 37:30.337
Mr. Eli Gold.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.575
And who is that?

37:32.610 --> 37:35.272
I_b_elieve he's a
Cl'lSlS consultant.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.548
And at one point,

37:36.580 --> 37:38.514
Peter Florrick's
campaign manager?

37:38.550 --> 37:40.586
Yes.

37:40.620 --> 37:43.350
PETER:
I think she was

37:43.390 --> 37:44.721
a teacher when I was there.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.489
She must be,
what, about 90?

37:46.530 --> 37:47.485
She's 95.

37:47.530 --> 37:48.758
She just had her birthday.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.528
(laughter)

37:49.560 --> 37:51.425
Is that Mom?

37:51.470 --> 37:53.665
Mom!

37:53.700 --> 37:56.066
What's wrong?

37:56.100 --> 37:57.738
Nothing. I'll be
right back.

37:57.770 --> 37:58.930
Well, your ice cream's
going to melt.

38:01.880 --> 38:02.835
Hi.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.347
Hi.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.507
You didn't return my calls.

38:06.550 --> 38:07.642
I know.
That's not fair.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.841
I didn't think it would be
a good idea if we talked.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.780
Well, we're talking
now because...

38:11.820 --> 38:13.447
Peter, this is wrong.

38:13.490 --> 38:14.752
We're fine.

38:14.790 --> 38:16.587
No, we're not.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.487
They have to do
what they have to do.

38:19.530 --> 38:20.781
What are you talking about?

38:20.830 --> 38:22.388
It's confidential.

38:22.430 --> 38:23.920
If you warned me
about the panel,

38:23.960 --> 38:24.927
you'd be breaking
confidentiality.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.699
You... I...

38:26.730 --> 38:28.368
That's not why I was calling.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.459
You didn't call me back. Why?

38:30.500 --> 38:32.468
Because I didn't want you
to break confidentiality.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.637
This is about
you buying the house.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.977
That's why I was calling.

38:36.010 --> 38:37.500
What house?

38:37.540 --> 38:40.509
Our old house-- _
you put a down payment on it?

38:40.550 --> 38:41.869
No.

38:41.920 --> 38:45.640
The sales contract
has your name on it.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.817
Alicia, I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:47.850 --> 38:49.659
Is our house for sale?

38:51.690 --> 38:53.385
There's another Florrick.

38:53.430 --> 38:55.398
What?!

38:55.430 --> 38:56.795
It's not just you and me.

38:56.830 --> 38:58.821
There's another Florrick.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.497
Jackie.

39:00.530 --> 39:02.532
Oh, my God.

39:02.570 --> 39:03.434
Jackie bought the house.

39:03.470 --> 39:05.529
What are you
talking about?
I got to go.

39:05.570 --> 39:07.765
Wait a minute._ Where
are you gomg?
To buy a gun.

39:11.580 --> 39:14.048
(loud chatter)
Uh, could I just speak
for a minute?

39:14.080 --> 39:16.446
Now, I have made no secret
of my interest

39:16.480 --> 39:18.380
in stepping
into a name partner role,

39:18.420 --> 39:20.445
mostly because
I believe the firm,

39:20.490 --> 39:22.651
and our bottom lines,
are hurt...

39:22.690 --> 39:23.281
Is this going
to take long?

39:23.320 --> 39:25.151
Only if it irritates you.

39:25.190 --> 39:27.488
But I have decided,

39:27.530 --> 39:31.057
after much reflection,
to support Julius Cain

39:31.100 --> 39:33.523
as a name partner,
because I feel he will best

39:33.570 --> 39:37.836
exemplify, um, the things...
that we want.

39:37.870 --> 39:38.859
Thank you, Eli.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.400
And, uh,

39:40.440 --> 39:42.635
I would like to applaud you
for that selfless act.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.399
Oh, come on. You flipped a coin
or something.

39:45.450 --> 39:47.805
ELI:
So I would urge the equity
partners who supported me

39:47.850 --> 39:50.171
in the last vote
to now support Julius...

39:50.220 --> 39:52.142
Point of information,
Madame Chair.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.111
What does that
even mean?

39:53.150 --> 39:55.050
It means, they can do
whatever they want.

39:55.090 --> 39:56.409
Granted.
I think

39:56.460 --> 39:57.609
one person is being overlooked

39:57.660 --> 39:58.854
in this rush to replace me

39:58.890 --> 40:00.528
as name partner
during my suspension.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.551
There is one person
in this room

40:02.600 --> 40:07.060
who has the most seniority
and institutional memory

40:07.100 --> 40:09.193
to lead us into
these difficult

40:09.240 --> 40:09.990
economic times.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.439
I have the most seniority here.

40:11.470 --> 40:12.698
No, David, you don't.

40:12.740 --> 40:14.833
Howard, do you mind standing?

40:14.880 --> 40:17.440
Yeah, okay.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.641
Oh, dear God,
you're kidding.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.442
You can't be serious.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.708
Who is that?

40:21.750 --> 40:22.944
Howard, would you be willing
to step up

40:22.980 --> 40:24.015
and help Diane
during these difficult times?

40:24.050 --> 40:27.087
If I get the corner office
closest to the restroom.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.213
Is that a motion to replace Will
with Howard Lyman?

40:29.260 --> 40:30.579
Yes.
Do I have
a second?

40:30.620 --> 40:32.087
MAN:
Second.
All in favor?

40:32.130 --> 40:34.086
Uh, what about debate?

40:34.130 --> 40:37.224
It's too_late.
We're now turning to a vote.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.967
It's all come down to this.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.558
Yup. (clears throat)

40:41.600 --> 40:42.669
You seem distracted.

40:42.700 --> 40:44.634
I am headed somewhere
after this.

40:44.670 --> 40:46.706
I'll get right to
the point then.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.605
There are two_
reports I can write.

40:48.640 --> 40:52.041
One says that there was nothing
unusual about this shooting.

40:52.080 --> 40:55.572
The police behaved admirably,
the victim behaved recklessly,

40:55.620 --> 40:57.679
and this was all just
an unfortunate accident.

40:57.720 --> 40:58.914
In other words, a lie?

40:58.950 --> 41:01.089
Well, let's just say,
a compromise.

41:01.120 --> 41:04.009
Second report mentions the
possibility of a drop gun,

41:04.060 --> 41:06.984
the business with the
n0ise on the platform,

41:07.030 --> 41:09.658
the embarrassing detail of
the State's Attorney's office

41:09.700 --> 41:12.669
ignoring clear evidence of a
drop gun for political ends,

41:12.700 --> 41:15.533
and the personal
involvement of your husband

41:15.570 --> 41:16.867
in the events
of the potential cover-up,

41:16.900 --> 41:19.039
and that will not look good
for him.

41:19.070 --> 41:23.006
And you want to know
which report I would vote for.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.905
Yeah, I want it
to be unanimous.

41:24.950 --> 41:28.169
I want_to avoid a
minority report.

41:28.210 --> 41:32.283
Very simply,
the more compromised report

41:32.320 --> 41:34.584
protects your husband.

41:34.620 --> 41:37.919
The more, shall we say,
forthcoming report,

41:37.960 --> 41:40.724
hurts your husband.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.751
Which one do you want?

41:46.130 --> 41:48.667
Nothing's simple, is it?

41:48.700 --> 41:50.736
Oh, that's not true.

41:50.770 --> 41:53.762
Candy Land is simple.

41:55.810 --> 41:58.802
I'm recusing myself.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.171
Any way

42:01.210 --> 42:03.542
I go on this decision,
I have a conflict of interest.

42:03.580 --> 42:05.787
Oh, that's too bad.

42:05.820 --> 42:07.879
That boy pleaded
with you for the truth.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.956
His father's dead,

42:09.990 --> 42:12.686
and all he wanted
from you was the truth.

42:16.730 --> 42:19.119
I'll see you again,
Mrs. Florrick.

42:19.170 --> 42:21.161
I doubt it.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.206
(whirring)

42:26.240 --> 42:28.208
MAN (singsongy):
He could be president.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.673
(laughing):
Oh, please, stop.

42:29.710 --> 42:31.598
What?!

42:31.650 --> 42:33.868
He's handsome enough.
Certainly tall enough.

42:33.910 --> 42:36.674
Oh, Peter doesn't even know
if he'll run for governor.

42:36.720 --> 42:37.948
Oh, he'll run
for governor.

42:37.980 --> 42:39.242
Oh, I don't know.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.758
He has to decide
by next week.

42:44.060 --> 42:47.325
Oh, Jacques, would-would you
just give me a second?

42:47.360 --> 42:48.827
Sure.

42:50.900 --> 42:52.868
Hello, Jackie.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.629
Alicia.

42:54.670 --> 42:56.661
You have a moment?

42:56.700 --> 42:58.930
I do.
