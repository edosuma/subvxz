WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:03.766
Okay, Emma,

00:04.062 --> 00:05.719
first doctor's visit.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.672
But have no fear,
because daddy's here.

00:07.792 --> 00:09.812
It's all pretty basic.

00:10.418 --> 00:11.748
Paper covered table.

00:11.868 --> 00:13.535
Which is good because
you never know

00:13.568 --> 00:14.536
where the last
baby has been.

00:14.570 --> 00:15.537
( Chuckles )

00:15.571 --> 00:16.671
Oh, look.

00:16.706 --> 00:18.440
Here's where they keep
all the free stuff.

00:18.474 --> 00:19.474
( Chuckles )

00:20.576 --> 00:21.576
Tucker?

00:24.547 --> 00:25.614
What?

00:25.648 --> 00:28.617
Hey, don't knock
the system, okay?

00:28.651 --> 00:29.718
Why do you think
we always have

00:29.752 --> 00:31.853
toilet paper
and napkins. Right?

00:31.888 --> 00:33.688
( Sighs ) You're gonna
get us kicked out

00:33.723 --> 00:34.689
before the doctor even--

00:34.724 --> 00:36.491
Oh! Tongue depressors.

00:37.827 --> 00:39.594
Or as I like to call them,

00:39.629 --> 00:40.729
- kickass drum sticks.
- Yup.

00:40.763 --> 00:43.532
( Drumming )

00:43.566 --> 00:44.800
Emma Wheeler?

00:44.834 --> 00:47.702
And her backup band,

00:47.737 --> 00:49.704
big finish!

00:49.739 --> 00:51.706
- ( Chuckles )
- Hi, I'm Emma's dad.

00:51.741 --> 00:52.908
Formally known
as just "Ben."

00:52.942 --> 00:54.676
- ( Chuckles )
- And I'm Tucker.

00:54.710 --> 00:56.878
We are not together.

00:57.914 --> 00:59.514
Why do you keep
telling people that?

00:59.549 --> 01:00.782
Dude, it's New York.

01:00.817 --> 01:01.817
People assume.

01:01.851 --> 01:03.485
Nobody assumes.

01:03.519 --> 01:04.718
I assumed.

01:05.755 --> 01:06.888
We're not together.

01:06.923 --> 01:08.423
I'm Ben Wheeler,

01:08.457 --> 01:10.458
Emma's straight
and very single father.

01:10.493 --> 01:11.593
That's good to know,

01:11.627 --> 01:13.895
Emma's very single father.

01:13.930 --> 01:15.463
( Chuckles )

01:17.600 --> 01:18.800
Oh.

01:30.847 --> 01:32.480
So, let's take a look

01:32.515 --> 01:33.782
at our little patient here.

01:33.816 --> 01:35.417
She really is adorable.

01:35.451 --> 01:36.418
( Chuckles )

01:36.452 --> 01:39.454
Thanks, I made her myself.

01:39.488 --> 01:40.455
I like to think that she got

01:40.489 --> 01:41.489
all of my good parts.

01:41.524 --> 01:42.891
Well, not all of--

01:42.925 --> 01:44.626
( mouths words )

01:44.660 --> 01:45.794
So, why don't you sit up

01:45.828 --> 01:46.862
on this table here.

01:46.896 --> 01:48.730
( Quietly ) Okay.

01:48.764 --> 01:50.699
I'm sorry, I didn't
get your name. Doctor...?

01:50.733 --> 01:52.701
Cassie.
I'm a nurse practitioner.

01:52.735 --> 01:54.736
Oh, well then we've
got a lot in common

01:54.770 --> 01:56.771
because I'm practicing
to be a dad. ( Chuckles )

01:57.840 --> 02:00.542
That is not
what it means, Ben.

02:02.812 --> 02:05.714
Oh, she likes you.

02:05.748 --> 02:06.781
I guess what
they say is true.

02:06.816 --> 02:08.550
What's true?

02:08.584 --> 02:10.485
Pretty girls like
to hang out together.

02:10.519 --> 02:12.487
Oh. ( Chuckles )

02:12.521 --> 02:14.456
Okay, well, there are
quite a few items

02:14.490 --> 02:16.424
you didn't answer
on the intake form.

02:16.459 --> 02:17.792
Oh, yeah. Some of those
questions were a little tricky.

02:17.827 --> 02:18.793
Date of birth?

02:18.828 --> 02:22.464
Whoa. ( Chuckles )

02:22.498 --> 02:23.832
Straight to the tough ones.

02:23.866 --> 02:25.467
Yeah.

02:25.501 --> 02:26.468
What else you got?

02:26.502 --> 02:27.736
Um...

02:27.770 --> 02:29.437
Mother's history?

02:30.773 --> 02:31.873
Checkered.

02:34.276 --> 02:36.811
Let's just say it's
a very complicated story.

02:36.846 --> 02:38.546
She split after
a one-night stand

02:38.581 --> 02:39.581
and left the baby
on the doormat.

02:39.615 --> 02:40.882
It's not really
all that complicated.

02:42.551 --> 02:44.486
Thanks, Tucker.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.687
Look, the point is

02:45.721 --> 02:47.722
I've only got one girl
in my life right now.

02:47.757 --> 02:49.624
So, please just
make sure she stays

02:49.659 --> 02:51.593
as perfect and healthy
as she seems.

02:51.627 --> 02:52.761
Mmm.

02:52.795 --> 02:54.829
Well, she's already got
one thing going for her.

02:54.864 --> 02:55.897
She's got you.

02:58.634 --> 03:00.502
( Sighs )

03:00.536 --> 03:02.437
Uh, what's this?

03:02.471 --> 03:03.638
My phone number.

03:03.673 --> 03:04.706
Give me a call sometime,

03:04.740 --> 03:06.641
very single Ben.

03:06.676 --> 03:07.876
The doctor will be right in.

03:14.617 --> 03:15.784
Oh, yes!
I just got hit on

03:15.818 --> 03:17.786
by a hot baby nurse.

03:17.820 --> 03:19.487
( Laughs )

03:19.522 --> 03:20.689
We make a good team.

03:20.723 --> 03:21.856
Yes, we do.

03:21.891 --> 03:23.625
Now shove these
down your pants.

03:27.730 --> 03:29.664
I'm so excited.

03:29.699 --> 03:30.699
I can't believe
I'm finally gonna get

03:30.733 --> 03:32.634
to see you play
in a pro game

03:32.668 --> 03:33.702
after all these years.

03:33.736 --> 03:35.637
Whereas I have
never missed one.

03:35.671 --> 03:37.439
( Chuckles )

03:37.473 --> 03:38.740
Really wish you could have
come up to Calgary.

03:38.774 --> 03:40.775
There every week.

03:40.810 --> 03:43.511
Well, I know it was
a little traumatic for you,

03:43.546 --> 03:45.613
but I for one am very
glad you got traded.

03:45.648 --> 03:46.715
Traumatic?

03:46.749 --> 03:47.816
No, players get traded

03:47.850 --> 03:48.883
for all kinds of reasons.

03:48.918 --> 03:50.685
I don't care
what that reporter said.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.686
What reporter?

03:51.721 --> 03:52.721
Oh.

03:52.755 --> 03:53.855
The one who said
the only thing worse

03:53.889 --> 03:54.856
than your skating is--

03:54.890 --> 03:56.725
- Aah.
- All kinds of reasons.

03:57.793 --> 03:58.860
I'm gonna go
get something to eat.

03:59.394 --> 04:01.596
Can we please
go over the list now?

04:01.630 --> 04:02.597
Everything's got
to be perfect.

04:02.631 --> 04:03.665
And it will be, honey.

04:03.699 --> 04:04.733
Mom's got it covered.

04:04.767 --> 04:05.800
You've got my
extra long laces

04:05.835 --> 04:07.469
from Gordon's?
My mouth guard

04:07.503 --> 04:08.703
- still in the package?
- I'm on it.

04:08.738 --> 04:09.838
And you're gonna
press my socks?

04:09.872 --> 04:12.440
The iron is already on.

04:12.475 --> 04:13.775
Oh, my God.
Did I leave the iron on?

04:15.544 --> 04:16.644
Wow!

04:16.678 --> 04:20.382
I can't believe you're
still so superstitious.

04:20.416 --> 04:21.683
Do you remember
that rank jersey

04:21.716 --> 04:22.751
you used to wear
in high school--

04:22.785 --> 04:24.753
- <i>Ooh.</i>
<i>- ( Gags, coughs )</i>

04:24.787 --> 04:25.887
Oh, my God.
That's the one.

04:26.889 --> 04:28.857
( Sighs ) I never washed it.

04:28.891 --> 04:29.858
Never will.

04:29.892 --> 04:32.761
That is the scent
of victory.

04:32.795 --> 04:34.696
Well, victory smells like

04:34.730 --> 04:36.631
the inside of a dumpster.

04:36.665 --> 04:38.666
A hot, sweaty dumpster

04:38.701 --> 04:40.568
that helps my baby win.

04:40.603 --> 04:41.569
Give me that.

04:41.604 --> 04:43.571
( Gags )

04:44.640 --> 04:45.874
I still wear it
under my uniform

04:45.908 --> 04:47.442
for every game.

04:47.476 --> 04:48.710
It's tight, but
it's definitely

04:48.744 --> 04:49.711
my good luck charm.

04:49.745 --> 04:50.779
He was wearing this
when he won

04:50.813 --> 04:52.480
his first championship.

04:52.515 --> 04:54.582
He was only 14.

04:54.617 --> 04:56.618
Oh, dear lord.
My eyes are watering.

04:58.621 --> 04:59.921
That bird was
already dead, right?

05:04.527 --> 05:05.693
- Yes!
- No!

05:05.728 --> 05:06.694
Laundry.
( Laughs )

05:06.729 --> 05:07.729
If it's drool,
spit-up,

05:07.763 --> 05:08.730
or doodie-related,

05:08.764 --> 05:09.831
it's your responsibility.

05:11.867 --> 05:13.368
Knock, knock?

05:13.402 --> 05:14.402
Hey.

05:14.437 --> 05:15.670
I was, uh,
just having dinner

05:15.704 --> 05:17.372
around the corner,
and I thought I would see

05:17.406 --> 05:18.740
if Ben needed any help
getting Emma to bed.

05:18.774 --> 05:20.775
Oh, don't you mean
see if Ben needed any help

05:20.810 --> 05:22.510
getting himself to bed?

05:22.545 --> 05:24.546
( Mocking )
Oh, you're hilarious.

05:24.580 --> 05:25.780
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Where is he?

05:25.815 --> 05:27.482
( Wincing ) He's on a date

05:27.516 --> 05:28.650
with Emma's nurse.

05:28.684 --> 05:30.685
Apparently,
Emma's not the only one

05:30.719 --> 05:32.587
who passed her physical.

05:33.889 --> 05:35.557
Isn't that
a conflict of interest?

05:35.591 --> 05:36.658
Only yours.

05:36.692 --> 05:38.426
Oh, come on.

05:38.461 --> 05:39.427
You gotta get over Ben.

05:39.462 --> 05:40.528
( Scoffs ) Please,

05:40.563 --> 05:42.430
I am completely over him.

05:43.532 --> 05:45.433
Ben, hi.
( Giggles )

05:45.468 --> 05:46.668
Hey, Riley.

05:46.702 --> 05:47.669
Great news,

05:47.703 --> 05:50.572
my date with Cassie
was amazing.

05:50.606 --> 05:51.706
Wow.

05:51.740 --> 05:53.575
That is great news.

05:53.609 --> 05:55.677
She's smart, pretty,

05:55.711 --> 05:57.479
taught me how to
take my own pulse,

05:57.513 --> 05:58.680
and Emma loves her.

05:58.714 --> 06:01.349
Ben, Emma loves everyone.

06:01.383 --> 06:02.350
She's like a puppy.

06:02.384 --> 06:03.551
Oh!

06:03.586 --> 06:05.753
- Did you miss your Auntie Riley--
- ( baby crying )

06:07.623 --> 06:08.790
Come on, Emma,
let's go finish

06:08.824 --> 06:10.391
"The Little Red
Riding Hood."

06:10.426 --> 06:11.759
My money's on the wolf.

06:11.794 --> 06:13.761
Tucker's got laundry again?

06:13.796 --> 06:14.762
<i>Yup.</i>

06:14.797 --> 06:17.398
( Laughs ) Sweet.

06:17.433 --> 06:18.600
It's weird,

06:18.634 --> 06:20.602
I've never gone out with
a girl like Cassie before.

06:20.636 --> 06:21.736
She's educated,

06:21.770 --> 06:22.770
she's a professional,

06:22.805 --> 06:24.372
she's...

06:24.406 --> 06:25.406
A grown-up.

06:27.710 --> 06:28.676
What?

06:28.711 --> 06:29.811
Let's just say

06:29.845 --> 06:31.513
that maybe
you're not exactly

06:31.547 --> 06:33.515
the best judge of character.

06:33.549 --> 06:34.549
You can get
a little distracted

06:34.583 --> 06:35.783
by other things.

06:35.818 --> 06:37.585
Like boobs.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.587
( Scoffs )

06:39.622 --> 06:40.622
Okay, that's not--

06:40.656 --> 06:42.690
okay, maybe
it's a little true.

06:42.725 --> 06:45.460
Which is why I need you.

06:45.494 --> 06:46.594
You do?

06:46.629 --> 06:47.629
Just have lunch with Cassie

06:47.663 --> 06:48.630
and tell me what you think.

06:48.664 --> 06:49.864
You can be totally honest.

06:49.899 --> 06:51.833
Okay, I'd rather not.

06:51.867 --> 06:52.834
( Chuckles )

06:52.868 --> 06:55.637
I mean after
you go out with her.

06:55.671 --> 06:57.405
Please? I think
this is the kind of girl

06:57.439 --> 06:59.507
that I should be dating
now that I have Emma.

06:59.542 --> 07:01.409
Fine.

07:01.443 --> 07:02.410
I'll do it.

07:02.444 --> 07:03.678
Thank you.

07:03.712 --> 07:04.712
You're such a great friend.

07:07.650 --> 07:09.584
I hate that word.

07:09.618 --> 07:11.519
Oh, hey, Tuck,
I've got a blankie

07:11.554 --> 07:13.388
in here that might
require a Hazmat suit.

07:21.497 --> 07:23.531
Oh.

07:23.566 --> 07:25.500
Oh, Emma.

07:27.670 --> 07:29.504
How could someone so small

07:29.538 --> 07:30.738
smell so bad?

07:35.611 --> 07:36.744
Your cheeseburger,

07:36.779 --> 07:39.447
and your 24 fries.

07:39.481 --> 07:40.748
I said 23.

07:40.783 --> 07:42.550
The number has to be
the same as my jersey.

07:47.556 --> 07:48.523
Thanks, bro.

07:48.557 --> 07:49.524
<i>( Laughing )</i>

07:49.558 --> 07:50.658
Ben.

07:50.693 --> 07:52.393
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:52.428 --> 07:53.428
( Chuckles )

07:54.863 --> 07:56.798
Everything you said
about Riley was true.

07:56.832 --> 07:59.667
We had such
a great time together.

07:59.702 --> 08:00.635

do this again soon?

Oh, it's a date.

08:02.838 --> 08:04.405
Oh! Okay.
Gotta go.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.441
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.

08:07.643 --> 08:08.810
So, what'd you think?

08:08.844 --> 08:10.645
Well, you were right.

08:10.679 --> 08:11.713
She's really special.

08:11.747 --> 08:13.448
Yes! I knew it.

08:14.550 --> 08:15.617
And by special, I mean

08:15.651 --> 08:16.618
I hate that girl.

08:16.652 --> 08:17.819
She is so going down.

08:20.556 --> 08:21.823
Hey, I need another one.

08:24.639 --> 08:26.151
Morning!

08:26.504 --> 08:28.078
I brought um--

08:29.176 --> 08:30.618
did somebody bake muffins?

08:33.201 --> 08:34.756
Did you make them?

08:36.687 --> 08:37.780
Then who did?

08:37.900 --> 08:39.092
Hi, Riles.

08:39.212 --> 08:40.929
I hope everything is okay.

08:40.962 --> 08:42.697
<i>I kind of</i> <i>had to improvise.</i>

08:42.731 --> 08:43.798
I gotta get to work,

08:43.832 --> 08:44.999
but I'll see everyone
at Danny's game

08:45.119 --> 08:46.511
- later, right?
- Most definitely.

08:46.857 --> 08:47.957
I miss you already.

08:47.991 --> 08:49.225
Aww.

08:49.259 --> 08:51.927
And here comes my omelet.

08:53.196 --> 08:54.930
I can't believe I know

08:54.965 --> 08:56.866
a real professional
hockey player.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.767
( Growls, laughs )

08:58.802 --> 08:59.835
( Gasps )

08:59.870 --> 09:01.203
Ooh. Are those
donuts?

09:01.238 --> 09:03.038
I love donuts.

09:03.073 --> 09:04.907
I'd live on them
if they weren't so...

09:04.941 --> 09:06.909
Fattening.
( Chuckles )

09:11.248 --> 09:13.015
I'm guessing she didn't
just stop by

09:13.049 --> 09:14.083
on her way into the office?

09:14.117 --> 09:15.217
Well, now that she has

09:15.252 --> 09:17.052
the Riley stamp of approval.

09:17.087 --> 09:18.821
I just met

09:18.855 --> 09:20.055
the most lovely girl

09:20.090 --> 09:21.257
in the hallway.

09:23.226 --> 09:24.960
Oh.

09:24.995 --> 09:26.262
Really, Riley?

09:28.064 --> 09:29.064
Hi, Ma.

09:29.099 --> 09:31.133
I gotta finish
getting ready for work.

09:31.168 --> 09:32.134
Are those my socks?

09:32.169 --> 09:33.235
Oh, no, honey.
These are mine.

09:34.905 --> 09:36.071
Didn't I tell you?
I just got drafted

09:36.106 --> 09:38.140
by the rangers.
Yes, these are your socks.

09:39.142 --> 09:40.109
Don't do that to me,

09:40.143 --> 09:41.143
I'm nervous enough.

09:42.846 --> 09:44.813
Wait, why do I
have no ketchup

09:44.848 --> 09:45.915
on my eggs?

09:45.949 --> 09:46.949
I always have
ketchup on my eggs

09:46.983 --> 09:47.950
on game day.

09:47.984 --> 09:49.218
This could have
been a disaster.

09:50.987 --> 09:53.055
( Gasps )

09:53.089 --> 09:54.857
- Aah.
- ( Gasps )

09:54.891 --> 09:56.192
Aah, what?

09:56.226 --> 09:58.027
Oh, yeah.
What was that?

09:59.229 --> 10:00.196
What was what?

10:00.230 --> 10:01.197
Nothing, honey.
Just keep

10:01.231 --> 10:02.231
building up your strength.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.067
It looked like a rag to me.

10:05.101 --> 10:06.268
( Grimaces )

10:06.303 --> 10:07.937
Tucker, nobody knows

10:07.971 --> 10:08.971
anything about anything.

10:09.005 --> 10:09.972
Do you understand?

10:10.006 --> 10:11.307
- Not really.
- Oh, is that Ben?

10:11.341 --> 10:13.175
He's calling you
to come help with Emma.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.177
"Hey, Tucker!"
He's coming!

10:15.212 --> 10:16.245
I don't hear anything.

10:16.279 --> 10:17.346
Just go.

10:20.016 --> 10:21.150
Hey-- hey, Danny!

10:21.184 --> 10:22.251
What do you say
we get out of here?

10:22.285 --> 10:23.252
You know, clear your head

10:23.286 --> 10:24.253
before the big game.

10:24.287 --> 10:25.321
Good idea.
I'll watch Emma.

10:25.355 --> 10:27.856
Go. Now.
Why are you still here?

10:27.891 --> 10:29.258
<i>Huh?</i>
<i>I'm still eating.</i>

10:29.292 --> 10:31.193
And that is the great thing

10:31.228 --> 10:32.861
about bread.

10:32.896 --> 10:33.929
Makes everything a sandwich.

10:33.964 --> 10:34.930
Yay. Yummy.

10:34.965 --> 10:36.198
All right, I will
see you tonight

10:36.233 --> 10:37.866
at the arena,
and there is nothing

10:37.901 --> 10:38.867
to worry about here.

10:38.902 --> 10:40.035
Not a thing.
So bye-bye, now.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.036
Bye-bye.

10:41.071 --> 10:42.037
Go on, bye-bye.

10:42.072 --> 10:43.205
- You sure...
- No, no, bye-bye, now!

10:43.240 --> 10:45.007
Bye! Bye!

10:48.178 --> 10:49.144
Okay, wait.

10:49.179 --> 10:51.247
I think I got it.

10:51.281 --> 10:52.982
Do you?

10:53.016 --> 10:54.049
Do you got

10:54.084 --> 10:56.051
that you just ended
Danny's career

10:56.086 --> 10:57.886
because you destroyed

10:57.921 --> 11:00.022
his lucky jersey?!

11:00.056 --> 11:01.890
No, I didn't get that part.

11:01.925 --> 11:02.925
Oh!

11:03.927 --> 11:04.927
She's such a phony.

11:04.961 --> 11:07.129
I mean, nobody is that nice.

11:07.163 --> 11:08.831
Oh, I made breakfast.

11:08.865 --> 11:10.933
I cooked everything myself.

11:10.967 --> 11:12.134
Who does that?

11:13.203 --> 11:14.303
You agree with me, right?

11:14.337 --> 11:17.072
Agree's kind of
a strong word.

11:17.107 --> 11:19.074
Danny, please.

11:19.109 --> 11:20.943
She is so manipulative.

11:20.977 --> 11:22.211
I know what Cassie is doing.

11:22.245 --> 11:23.212
Trying to have
a relationship

11:23.246 --> 11:24.213
with my brother?

11:24.247 --> 11:26.181
Exactly.

11:26.216 --> 11:27.216
And how is that
any different

11:27.250 --> 11:28.951
from what you're
trying to do?

11:28.985 --> 11:30.919
It's different because...

11:30.954 --> 11:32.054
She's better at it.

11:32.088 --> 11:33.889
( Sighs )

11:33.923 --> 11:34.957
( Groans )

11:34.991 --> 11:36.058
Okay, I admit it.

11:36.092 --> 11:37.226
Maybe I'm a little jealous,

11:37.260 --> 11:40.896
but I just can't stop
thinking about him.

11:40.930 --> 11:42.197
It's like ever since
he came back into my life,

11:42.232 --> 11:44.199
all of these old feelings
from high school

11:44.234 --> 11:46.268
just came bubbling back up.

11:46.303 --> 11:48.003
Only this time I think

11:48.038 --> 11:49.938
maybe he'll notice me now.

11:49.973 --> 11:52.107
You know, I'm not
Ri-gantor anymore.

11:52.142 --> 11:54.977
I'm not the fat girl
that used to sit on his head.

11:56.846 --> 11:57.946
I just keep imagining

11:57.981 --> 11:59.915
he's finally gonna
walk up to me and say--

11:59.949 --> 12:01.016
stay out of
the ladies' room.

12:01.051 --> 12:02.284
Somebody just puked.

12:06.056 --> 12:07.256
Not quite the same ring

12:07.290 --> 12:09.224
as "I've always
loved you."

12:09.259 --> 12:11.026
Trust me.

12:11.061 --> 12:12.161
It's his loss.

12:13.263 --> 12:14.963
I'm sure one of these days

12:14.998 --> 12:17.900
you'll find someone
even bigger.

12:17.934 --> 12:19.902
I mean, better.

12:19.936 --> 12:21.937
Thanks.

12:21.971 --> 12:22.938
I know you're right.

12:22.972 --> 12:24.039
It's just--

12:24.074 --> 12:25.207
it's really hard
to listen to someone

12:25.241 --> 12:27.109
that you like
talk about someone else.

12:27.143 --> 12:28.277
I get it.

12:28.311 --> 12:29.278
Believe me.

12:29.312 --> 12:30.312
I get it.

12:32.048 --> 12:33.215
How hard can it be?

12:33.249 --> 12:34.950
You know, I'll--
I'll buy a jersey,

12:34.984 --> 12:36.118
I'll tie it to my bumper,

12:36.152 --> 12:37.119
I'll drive it around town,

12:37.153 --> 12:38.253
and wrap it in dead meat,

12:38.288 --> 12:39.988
and then I'll just
shove it in a plastic bag

12:40.023 --> 12:41.824
and drop it off at the arena.
He'll never know.

12:41.858 --> 12:42.991
( Exhales )

12:43.026 --> 12:44.259
I think we're actually good.

12:44.294 --> 12:45.794
- Okay.
- Yeah.

12:45.829 --> 12:46.829
Check this out.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.266
He'll never know, right?

12:51.301 --> 12:52.968
Oh, yeah.

12:53.002 --> 12:54.236
Oh, yeah, it's perfect.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.071
He hasn't taken
that many pucks to the head.

12:56.106 --> 12:57.773
He'll know!

12:57.807 --> 12:59.041
You have to protect me.

12:59.075 --> 13:00.075
No.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.878
No, what I have to do
is mom-up.

13:02.912 --> 13:05.214
I'm going to go talk
to my son.

13:05.248 --> 13:07.015
I'm gonna tell him
to grow up,

13:07.050 --> 13:08.150
and hopefully, I'll stop him

13:08.184 --> 13:09.752
from shredding you

13:09.786 --> 13:12.087
like you did
his lucky jersey.

13:12.122 --> 13:13.822
I'll wait here.

13:13.857 --> 13:15.023
Yeah, I'm sure.

13:16.793 --> 13:18.794
<i>It's okay,</i> <i>I'm his mother.</i>

13:19.996 --> 13:21.830
Oh, Danny.

13:21.865 --> 13:23.766
- We need to talk.
- Where have you been?

13:23.800 --> 13:24.800
( Sighs )

13:25.902 --> 13:26.902
It's all right.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.070
Nothing I haven't
seen before.

13:29.806 --> 13:30.773
Except maybe that.

13:30.807 --> 13:31.974
Hi, Bonnie Wheeler...

13:32.008 --> 13:33.142
Mom!

13:33.176 --> 13:34.777
Right.

13:34.811 --> 13:36.945
Listen.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.213
- Listen, honey.
- My laces,

13:38.248 --> 13:39.882
my mouth guard,

13:39.916 --> 13:40.883
wait.

13:40.917 --> 13:41.950
Where's my lucky jersey?

13:41.985 --> 13:43.152
Yeah, about that.

13:43.186 --> 13:44.186
Um...

13:44.220 --> 13:45.954
Sweetie, do you--

13:45.989 --> 13:47.256
do you remember
when you were little

13:47.290 --> 13:49.124
and your rabbit,

13:49.159 --> 13:50.859
Mr. Hopson,

13:50.894 --> 13:52.261
went to go live
in the country?

13:53.295 --> 13:54.129
Yeah.

13:54.164 --> 13:55.264
Well,

13:55.298 --> 13:56.832
the same thing
kind of happened

13:56.866 --> 13:58.867
to your jersey.

13:58.902 --> 14:01.770
My jersey's on a farm
in Pennsylvania?

14:01.805 --> 14:03.806
No.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.741
Danny, your jersey

14:05.775 --> 14:09.111
has gone to the
great laundry basket in the sky.

14:11.848 --> 14:14.750
It bit the dust
in the washer.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.152
It's sleeping with the lint.

14:17.187 --> 14:18.720
It's ruined, destroyed,

14:18.755 --> 14:19.888
nothing left!

14:19.923 --> 14:21.156
You lost my jersey?

14:21.191 --> 14:23.992
Close enough.

14:24.027 --> 14:25.060
But, honey, listen to me.

14:25.094 --> 14:26.061
It is going to be okay.

14:26.095 --> 14:27.095
No. No.

14:27.130 --> 14:29.131
No, no, it's not
going to be okay!

14:29.165 --> 14:30.199
I can't go out there.

14:30.233 --> 14:31.867
I've never gone
out there without it.

14:31.901 --> 14:33.035
Quick, cut my
Achilles tendon.

14:33.069 --> 14:34.770
Listen, listen.
Just pull yourself together!

14:34.804 --> 14:36.038
Honey, listen to me.

14:36.072 --> 14:37.873
It's just a jersey.

14:37.907 --> 14:39.141
It's not lucky.

14:39.175 --> 14:40.142
Okay?

14:40.176 --> 14:42.811
None of this stuff
is lucky, okay?

14:42.846 --> 14:44.913
You don't need these laces!

14:44.948 --> 14:47.883
Okay? You don't
need this mouth guard.

14:47.917 --> 14:50.752
Okay, maybe you need
that mouth guard,

14:50.787 --> 14:52.821
but it's not
because it's lucky.

14:52.856 --> 14:54.089
It's because I paid
a lot of money

14:54.123 --> 14:55.190
for those teeth.

14:57.861 --> 14:59.094
Now, look at me.

14:59.128 --> 15:01.063
You are an amazing,

15:01.097 --> 15:02.965
talented athlete.

15:02.999 --> 15:04.867
All right, you're
Danny Wheeler.

15:04.901 --> 15:07.169
You are the best damn player
on this team!

15:12.141 --> 15:14.209
Just trying to make
a point here, people.

15:15.211 --> 15:16.979
So don't let some old shirt

15:17.013 --> 15:18.780
determine your greatness.

15:18.815 --> 15:19.882
Listen.

15:19.916 --> 15:21.183
You get out there,

15:21.217 --> 15:22.951
and you make
your mother proud.

15:22.986 --> 15:24.786
Thanks, Mom.

15:24.821 --> 15:25.821
Yeah.

15:28.992 --> 15:30.058
- Mom!
- Yeah, I know, I know.

15:30.093 --> 15:31.860
I know.

15:31.895 --> 15:34.763
<i>( Cheering )</i>

15:34.797 --> 15:35.898
All: Whoo!

15:35.932 --> 15:38.000
Whoo!
That's my boy.

15:38.034 --> 15:39.001
Oh, look, Emma.
Can you see Uncle Danny?

15:41.070 --> 15:42.804
Hi, Emma.

15:43.907 --> 15:45.741
Let's go, Wheeler!

15:45.775 --> 15:47.142
- Come on, Danny!
- Whoo!

15:47.176 --> 15:48.777
Is it always this violent?

15:48.811 --> 15:49.945
Only if you're lucky.

15:49.979 --> 15:51.013
Isn't it great?

15:51.047 --> 15:52.814
Oh, it's called hockey, ref!

15:52.849 --> 15:53.882
Not cuddling!

15:55.051 --> 15:56.118
Hey, thanks again
for being so nice

15:56.152 --> 15:57.719
to Cassie.
It really means a lot

15:57.754 --> 15:58.720
to me and Emma.

15:58.755 --> 15:59.955
- No problem.
- <i>( Whistles )</i>

16:00.957 --> 16:01.924
Cross check?

16:01.958 --> 16:03.692
What are you, blind?

16:03.726 --> 16:04.693
He hit him first.

16:04.727 --> 16:05.928
Come on!

16:05.962 --> 16:07.062
Really, 'cause
it looked like

16:07.096 --> 16:08.697
Danny just
whaled on--

16:08.731 --> 16:09.898
I'll be quiet.

16:09.933 --> 16:11.133
Where's Danny going?

16:11.167 --> 16:12.834
Penalty Box.
I'm gonna go check on him.

16:12.869 --> 16:14.703
- I'll be right back.
- Oh. ( Chuckles )

16:16.806 --> 16:18.040
So.

16:18.074 --> 16:19.141
How's it going so far?

16:20.710 --> 16:21.710
We should talk.

16:23.813 --> 16:25.847
Dude!
You're amazing!

16:25.882 --> 16:27.115
What's gotten into you?

16:27.650 --> 16:29.284
I don't know.

16:29.318 --> 16:30.285
It's like I'm totally free

16:30.319 --> 16:32.387
without that jersey.

16:32.421 --> 16:34.522
Maybe it's because
I can move my arms.

16:34.557 --> 16:36.291
- Yeah!
- ( Laughs )

16:36.325 --> 16:37.459
It's pretty obvious

16:37.493 --> 16:38.626
you're in love with Ben.

16:38.661 --> 16:40.295
What?

16:40.329 --> 16:41.362
No.

16:41.397 --> 16:43.264
That is so...

16:43.299 --> 16:44.265
What?

16:44.300 --> 16:45.433
( Laughs )

16:45.468 --> 16:46.468
It's okay.

16:46.502 --> 16:47.469
It's not like
I'm threatened,

16:47.503 --> 16:48.536
I just--

16:48.571 --> 16:49.637
I feel badly for you

16:49.672 --> 16:51.272
because he's never
gonna see you

16:51.307 --> 16:52.674
as anything other than...

16:52.708 --> 16:53.708
Fatpants.
( Chuckles )

16:56.312 --> 16:57.479
All right,
get back out there.

16:57.513 --> 16:59.347
But maybe try to punch out
a few less people

16:59.381 --> 17:00.615
and stay out
of the penalty box.

17:00.649 --> 17:02.250
I don't think it's me

17:02.284 --> 17:03.384
you need to worry about.

17:03.419 --> 17:05.520
<i>( Cheering )</i>

17:08.223 --> 17:09.324
Ri-gantor!

17:09.358 --> 17:11.392
<i>Whoo!</i>

17:17.175 --> 17:18.175
Oh, my God.

17:18.210 --> 17:19.243
What is wrong with me?

17:20.031 --> 17:22.269
I try so hard,
but Ri-gantor

17:22.388 --> 17:24.415
still comes roaring out.

17:24.450 --> 17:25.712
Don't feel too bad.

17:25.973 --> 17:27.106
Cassie's a nurse.

17:27.141 --> 17:28.908
She knows how
to put on a neck brace.

17:28.942 --> 17:30.810
( Chuckles )

17:30.844 --> 17:32.879
I'm sure Ben hates me now.

17:32.913 --> 17:34.381
He doesn't hate you.

17:34.501 --> 17:35.781
Just talk to him.

17:37.705 --> 17:38.838
I can't go in there.

17:38.873 --> 17:39.873
I can't do it.

17:39.907 --> 17:41.808
You gotta face that fear.

17:41.842 --> 17:42.809
Look at me.

17:42.843 --> 17:44.644
I faced mine tonight.

17:44.678 --> 17:45.645
And won.

17:45.679 --> 17:47.614
That puck bounced
off your helmet.

17:47.648 --> 17:49.849
On purpose.

17:49.884 --> 17:50.950
I'm just saying.

17:50.985 --> 17:51.918
You gotta tell him the truth

17:51.952 --> 17:53.520
about what happened
with Cassie

17:53.554 --> 17:54.521
and then move on.

17:54.555 --> 17:55.688
( Sighs )

17:55.723 --> 17:56.890
I wish it were that easy.

17:58.893 --> 18:00.527
I'll see you guys
at your place.

18:00.561 --> 18:02.662
Congratulations, Wheeler.

18:08.702 --> 18:09.936
My brother's an idiot.

18:11.639 --> 18:12.739
To my amazing son

18:12.773 --> 18:14.541
and his game winning goal.

18:14.575 --> 18:16.543
( Cheering )

18:16.577 --> 18:17.844
See, sweetie?

18:17.878 --> 18:20.647
You never needed
that lucky jersey after all.

18:20.681 --> 18:21.748
What a game, man.

18:21.782 --> 18:23.650
Danny, you were amazing.

18:23.684 --> 18:24.684
But, I think we owe

18:24.718 --> 18:26.786
this little lady,
and me of course,

18:26.821 --> 18:28.755
a big thank you.

18:28.789 --> 18:29.789
Pull my finger.

18:33.727 --> 18:34.861
My lucky jersey?

18:34.895 --> 18:37.630
Now in a convenient
fun size.

18:37.665 --> 18:38.698
( Laughs )

18:38.732 --> 18:40.733
I knew how important
it was to you.

18:40.768 --> 18:42.836
Ooh, thank you, Tucker.

18:42.870 --> 18:45.839
That was so, so, thoughtful.

18:45.873 --> 18:47.974
So it was there all along.

18:48.008 --> 18:49.709
This is the reason I won.

18:49.743 --> 18:51.578
Or perhaps

18:51.612 --> 18:53.546
it was my brilliant pep talk

18:53.581 --> 18:54.848
that convinced you

18:54.882 --> 18:57.817
to give up a decade
of silly superstitions

18:57.852 --> 19:00.520
and finally learn
to believe in yourself.

19:00.554 --> 19:01.754
No. It was Tucker.

19:01.789 --> 19:02.922
( Quietly ) Okay.

19:02.957 --> 19:05.725
Emma, you're my new
good luck charm.

19:05.759 --> 19:08.528
But, mom, you'll always
be my sock girl.

19:09.597 --> 19:10.830
Oh, fine. As long as
I get to meet you

19:10.865 --> 19:12.665
in the locker room
before every game.

19:12.700 --> 19:15.502
Oh, and if that hottie
in the towel asks,

19:15.536 --> 19:16.703
I'm your sister--
not your mother.

19:20.975 --> 19:23.576
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:23.611 --> 19:24.777
So, uh, here's something

19:24.812 --> 19:27.547
I haven't said
to anyone since high school.

19:27.581 --> 19:28.615
Sorry I put your girlfriend

19:28.649 --> 19:29.749
in a headlock.

19:30.784 --> 19:32.619
Apparently, still
your signature move.

19:33.687 --> 19:34.787
How's Cassie?

19:36.624 --> 19:37.757
We broke up.

19:39.026 --> 19:41.761
Ben-- ( Groans )
I'm sorry.

19:41.795 --> 19:42.929
It was totally my fault.

19:42.963 --> 19:44.631
If you want me
to go talk to her--

19:44.665 --> 19:46.833
Not sure how helpful
that would be.

19:46.867 --> 19:49.602
But, um...

19:49.637 --> 19:51.838
She was obsessed
with this idea

19:51.872 --> 19:53.540
that you have a crush on me.

19:53.574 --> 19:54.874
( Scoffs ) What?

19:54.909 --> 19:56.609
No.

19:56.644 --> 19:57.877
That is so...

19:57.912 --> 19:59.012
What?

19:59.046 --> 20:00.046
( Chuckles )

20:01.815 --> 20:02.849
It was probably my fault.

20:02.883 --> 20:04.651
I talked about you a lot.

20:04.685 --> 20:05.919
You mean, like telling her

20:05.953 --> 20:07.587
my nickname was Fatpants?

20:07.621 --> 20:08.888
Thanks for that.

20:08.923 --> 20:10.590
No, I just

20:10.624 --> 20:11.891
told her what
we were like as kids,

20:11.926 --> 20:13.693
and how you grew
into this amazing,

20:13.727 --> 20:14.894
independent woman.

20:16.964 --> 20:18.698
And how I hope Emma grows up

20:18.732 --> 20:19.832
to be just like you.

20:22.036 --> 20:23.970
You did?

20:24.004 --> 20:25.772
Yeah, I did.

20:27.975 --> 20:29.909
So we're good?

20:29.944 --> 20:31.811
All good.

20:31.845 --> 20:32.912
I'm really glad
we're friends.

20:34.048 --> 20:35.615
To friends.

20:42.890 --> 20:43.890
Friends.

20:43.924 --> 20:45.631
Oh, nope.
Still hate it.
