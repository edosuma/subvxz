WEBVTT

00:01.351 --> 00:03.035
Previously on "Arrow"...

00:03.111 --> 00:04.369
This is a plan
to level all of star city.

00:04.380 --> 00:05.923
Felicity wouldn't do
something like this.

00:05.947 --> 00:07.227
Maybe she had a change of heart,

00:07.291 --> 00:09.124
tried to back out last second.

00:09.201 --> 00:10.887
It'd explain why someone
would want her dead, right?

00:10.911 --> 00:12.836
Last call out
was to someone named...

00:12.913 --> 00:13.804
Blackstar.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.714
What's this?

00:15.791 --> 00:16.851
Something I lifted off byrd
before he went into custody.

00:16.875 --> 00:18.425
It's a painting? All right.

00:18.436 --> 00:20.302
Looks like someone doesn't
want us to see this.

00:20.378 --> 00:22.220
Ricardo Diaz
is behind bars tonight,

00:22.231 --> 00:24.231
thanks to the unidentified
green arrow.

00:24.308 --> 00:26.725
Felicity put a gun
right to my face.

00:26.736 --> 00:28.143
I don't believe you.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.936
I made a deal with the feds.

00:30.013 --> 00:31.405
Oliver will be a free man again.

01:19.622 --> 01:21.363
After keeping a low profile

01:21.439 --> 01:23.907
since his release last week,
Oliver queen will make

01:23.984 --> 01:25.909
his first public appearance
tonight

01:25.986 --> 01:28.870
at a gala supporting
prison reform.

01:28.947 --> 01:31.915
But will star city welcome back
its former vigilante

01:31.926 --> 01:33.583
with open arms?

01:33.660 --> 01:36.378
Or has public opinion soured
against the green arrow

01:36.454 --> 01:39.223
now that we know who's under
that hood?

02:06.067 --> 02:06.908
Aah!

02:06.985 --> 02:11.003
Hey. It's just me.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.584
Hey. I'm sorry about earlier.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.127
I didn't mean to freak you out.

02:17.204 --> 02:18.512
No. I'm just, um, getting used

02:18.589 --> 02:20.013
to being home.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.518
Mm. I missed that.

02:24.595 --> 02:26.761
Having someone
to zip your dress?

02:26.838 --> 02:29.690
Well, that, and you.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.935
And I really miss William.

02:34.012 --> 02:35.812
Yeah. Christmas vacation
feels like

02:35.889 --> 02:37.772
it's 20 years from now.

02:38.942 --> 02:42.194
So why aren't you dressed?

02:42.270 --> 02:43.987
I'm gonna sit this one out.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.199
Oh, no, no, no.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.825
I don't think that's
how this works,

02:48.902 --> 02:50.919
especially when you're
the one being honored.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.996
Besides, you've been
spending more time

02:53.073 --> 02:54.497
in the shadows recently

02:54.574 --> 02:56.166
than when you were
the green arrow.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.552
The last time I faced
the city, I was in cuffs.

02:58.629 --> 03:00.378
A lot of people are
mad at me, Felicity.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.005
I lied to them.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.724
They have a right to be
mad at me.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.225
Which is exactly why
this event is

03:05.302 --> 03:06.843
so important.

03:06.920 --> 03:11.014
They want to publicly
recognize you as a hero.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.183
And after all the lives
you saved at slabside,

03:13.260 --> 03:16.186
let them see you
for who you really are,

03:16.263 --> 03:19.406
without a mask.

03:19.483 --> 03:21.408
I mean, you're probably right.

03:21.485 --> 03:23.702
Oh, I'm always right.

03:31.111 --> 03:34.588
You will always be
the best part of me

03:34.665 --> 03:36.331
for the rest of my life.

03:36.408 --> 03:37.624
You remember.

03:37.701 --> 03:39.593
Of course I remember.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.169
Happy anniversary.

03:41.246 --> 03:42.721
Happy anniversary.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.661
This used to be the
nicest club in town

04:02.693 --> 04:04.117
20 years ago.

04:04.194 --> 04:06.069
You can practically
smell the money.

04:06.146 --> 04:08.905
Yeah. Definitely
not smelling that.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.366
I can't believe Roy's
missing out on all the fun.

04:13.111 --> 04:14.347
If he got recognized here,
we'd have big trouble.

04:14.371 --> 04:16.954
And you're sure
blackstar's here?

04:16.966 --> 04:19.708
The canary network
couldn't find much,

04:19.784 --> 04:21.803
but they did learn blackstar
likes to frequent this club.

04:21.827 --> 04:24.963
I seriously question this
person's choice of friends.

04:24.974 --> 04:27.257
That's why we need
to keep our heads down.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.967
Blackstar was the last one
to talk to Felicity.

04:28.978 --> 04:30.196
Whoever this is could have
either been helping her or...

04:30.220 --> 04:32.178
Or they're the one
who killed her.

04:34.132 --> 04:36.224
And you were worried this
was going to be dangerous.

04:36.301 --> 04:38.393
Hey, we're looking
for someone named blackstar.

04:38.470 --> 04:39.394
You know who that is?

04:39.471 --> 04:41.313
Yeah. She's right there.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.115
Uh!

05:32.282 --> 05:36.618
Blackstar!
Blackstar! Blackstar! Blackstar!

05:36.694 --> 05:40.714
Blackstar! Blackstar!
Blackstar! Blackstar!

05:40.791 --> 05:42.832
Blackstar! Blackstar...

05:42.909 --> 05:45.093
Well, she seems easy to talk to.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.549
We didn't get this
treatment after we

05:51.560 --> 05:53.635
put Diaz behind bars.

05:53.711 --> 05:56.346
Envy is not a good look on you.

05:56.423 --> 05:57.889
Neither is the crab cake

05:57.900 --> 05:59.566
on your face.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.071
This event is messed up.

06:04.147 --> 06:06.189
Rich folk and politicians
fronting

06:06.266 --> 06:08.325
like they actually care
about prison reform.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.744
If everybody in here
actually gave a crap,

06:10.821 --> 06:12.570
they'd use that money
to help people

06:12.581 --> 06:14.041
in hard-up neighborhoods
who end up in the system

06:14.065 --> 06:15.907
because they don't
have anything else.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.751
What?

06:17.828 --> 06:20.212
You ever think about
running for office?

06:22.449 --> 06:24.707
Oliver, what's it
like to be out of prison?

06:24.784 --> 06:26.334
How does it feel to be back home

06:26.411 --> 06:28.171
with everyone knowing
you're the green arrow?

06:28.213 --> 06:29.765
Are you gonna put on the
hood now that you're back?

06:29.789 --> 06:32.340
My husband is very grateful

06:32.417 --> 06:34.768
to be home with
his family. Thank you.

06:40.609 --> 06:44.060
Excuse me. Queen!

06:44.137 --> 06:45.445
Max Fuller.

06:45.522 --> 06:47.605
Hey, man, I know we've
had some bad history.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.199
You, uh, had your bodyguards

06:49.276 --> 06:50.942
kick the crap out of me
and Tommy at your club.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.246
Right. Well, you slept
with my wife.

06:52.270 --> 06:54.237
Well, now my ex-wife.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.239
Dude, all that is in
the past, ok?

06:56.316 --> 06:57.596
You're the freaking green arrow.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.826
Well, I'm Felicity.

06:59.837 --> 07:02.454
I am the wife of
the freaking green arrow.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.966
That sounded a little less
strange in my head.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.415
Impressed.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.125
You see, he didn't used
to be the marriage type.

07:07.136 --> 07:08.334
- Ah. Hmm.
- Yeah.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.522
But, hey, people change, right?

07:09.546 --> 07:11.254
Yes, they do.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.475
And we are just gonna say hi
to some friends

07:12.499 --> 07:13.965
if you'll excuse us.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.809
Yeah, please.

07:15.886 --> 07:17.811
Is it just me,

07:17.888 --> 07:19.646
or is that guy
the absolute worst?

07:19.723 --> 07:21.389
Uh...

07:22.893 --> 07:24.392
I never got to ask you.

07:24.469 --> 07:25.946
What was your first meal
when you got back?

07:25.970 --> 07:27.979
Double double
at big belly burger.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.865
That's what I'm talking about.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.902
Taking a while to get
those sea legs back, huh?

07:33.978 --> 07:35.904
Speaking of,

07:35.980 --> 07:37.216
you thinking about
getting back out there,

07:37.240 --> 07:38.342
trying that old suit
on for size?

07:38.366 --> 07:39.324
Shh, shh. No, no, no.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.950
He's absolutely not

07:41.027 --> 07:42.660
just like we don't
do that anymore.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.287
Dinah's right.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.456
I'm very much enjoying not
being in prison.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.457
So what now?

07:47.534 --> 07:49.083
I don't know.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.677
Find a different way
to help the city,

07:50.754 --> 07:52.253
way you guys did.

07:52.330 --> 07:53.796
What about you, Felicity?

07:53.873 --> 07:55.673
Well, I'm developing a new
security system.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.510
Well, then I'm sure
it's the best one in town.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.802
We're friends with her now?

07:59.879 --> 08:01.179
It's more like frenemies.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.640
It's a long story.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.767
Relax. I'm just here
keeping up appearances.

08:05.843 --> 08:07.560
D.a., remember?

08:07.637 --> 08:09.198
Actually, we should all
really be thanking Laurel.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.282
I mean, she is the one
who did the trade

08:10.306 --> 08:11.367
to get Oliver out of prison.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.107
That's true.

08:13.184 --> 08:14.943
I'm very grateful.

08:15.019 --> 08:17.320
I know that I haven't
always given you

08:17.397 --> 08:19.039
the benefit of the doubt, so...

08:19.115 --> 08:21.324
Well, it was really Felicity

08:21.401 --> 08:24.160
who was willing to do
anything to stop Diaz.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.120
She's ruthless.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.049
Welcome.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.678
Thank you all
for attending this evening.

08:30.702 --> 08:33.336
I would like to introduce
this evening's honoree,

08:33.413 --> 08:35.337
Mr. Oliver queen.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.138
Thank you, mayor pollard.

08:45.976 --> 08:49.143
I used to believe
that justice was

08:49.220 --> 08:54.524
as simple as putting
criminals behind bars...

08:54.601 --> 08:57.577
But then I spent
some time in prison,

08:57.654 --> 09:00.738
and I realized that the truth is

09:00.749 --> 09:02.415
nowhere near
that black and white.

09:02.492 --> 09:04.158
The truth is that
our institutions have

09:04.235 --> 09:05.702
a long way to go

09:05.778 --> 09:07.058
before they achieve
true justice.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.474
The attack perpetrated by
the green arrow this evening

09:28.485 --> 09:30.560
is further proof
why we, as a city,

09:30.571 --> 09:33.187
cannot trust men
that hide behind masks.

09:33.264 --> 09:36.190
There is a reason why the
anti-vigilante law exists.

09:36.267 --> 09:37.734
Thank you.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.611
Look, I know how this looks,

09:39.621 --> 09:41.613
but this wasn't
the new green arrow.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.364
He hasn't murdered anyone.

09:43.441 --> 09:44.791
That you know of.

09:44.868 --> 09:46.784
Has anyone actually seen
who's behind the mask?

09:46.861 --> 09:48.981
Well, no. But whoever it is
has been helping the city.

09:49.039 --> 09:50.630
And helped us take down Diaz.

09:50.707 --> 09:52.790
This was cold-blooded murder.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.135
Now, I appreciate how
all of you feel as though

09:55.211 --> 09:56.794
the new green arrow is an ally,

09:56.805 --> 09:58.379
but I would like to be sure.

09:58.456 --> 09:59.631
And how are you gonna do that

09:59.641 --> 10:01.641
if you're a no-go on the arrow?

10:01.718 --> 10:03.551
Is there a law against
me consulting?

10:03.628 --> 10:04.802
You mean an investigative
consultant, like "the mentalist"?

10:04.813 --> 10:06.387
I love that show.

10:06.464 --> 10:08.139
I can't think of
a better way to investigate

10:08.150 --> 10:09.807
a copycat green arrow than
with the original.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.434
I can. With my help,

10:11.511 --> 10:13.486
because I'm not
sitting this one out.

10:13.563 --> 10:14.979
I appreciate it,

10:14.990 --> 10:16.481
but there's nothing left
to be done tonight,

10:16.491 --> 10:17.657
so go home.

10:17.734 --> 10:19.067
Let my guys work the scene.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.453
And if I need help, I'll
call you tomorrow.

10:24.908 --> 10:27.825
This is everything dinah's
compiled on the vigilante...

10:27.836 --> 10:29.336
Every sighting, targets.

10:29.412 --> 10:30.995
It's all there.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.497
It says here the scpd

10:32.507 --> 10:33.831
nearly arrested him last month.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.333
But he had an accomplice?

10:35.344 --> 10:37.510
Uh, yeah, that... that was me.

10:37.587 --> 10:39.003
I, uh,

10:39.014 --> 10:41.172
I didn't want dinah
to lock him up.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.849
Oh, I bet she really
appreciated that.

10:42.926 --> 10:44.008
She threw my ass in jail.

10:44.085 --> 10:45.677
I'm really sad I missed that.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.929
What else do we know?

10:48.005 --> 10:49.639
Uh, he's definitely
not a rookie. I know that.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.192
I mean, the guy's efficient,
disciplined, precise.

10:52.268 --> 10:53.643
I mean,
he works the bow and arrow

10:53.720 --> 10:55.311
about as well as you do.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.604
That takes

10:56.681 --> 10:58.573
a very specific
type of training.

11:00.944 --> 11:02.527
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

11:02.603 --> 11:04.204
Pollard's on the warpath.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.873
That's ok. Forensics pull
anything from the scene?

11:06.950 --> 11:08.875
Well, nothing we didn't
already suspect.

11:08.952 --> 11:10.993
Arrows are consistent
with the vigilante.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.245
Here. Take a look.

11:12.321 --> 11:13.963
Thank you.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.875
Well, they're both handmade.

11:17.952 --> 11:21.045
The materials in the arrowhead
seem to match.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.547
This would be difficult
to replicate.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.841
But not impossible, right?

11:24.917 --> 11:26.300
The security camera footage?

11:26.311 --> 11:28.678
Yeah, but you're
not gonna find much.

11:28.755 --> 11:30.513
The killer was off-camera.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.181
His arrows weren't.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.027
If this guy is as precise
with a bow and arrow

11:34.051 --> 11:36.894
as Rene says, then he
would've had a target.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.489
Based on the trajectory,
that guy.

11:40.984 --> 11:43.484
Oh, wait a minute. That's...
That's Clayton Ford.

11:43.561 --> 11:45.695
He's a rich dude who
actually helped the glades.

11:45.772 --> 11:46.913
He funded a clinic.

11:46.990 --> 11:48.197
This makes no sense.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.585
The vigilante's only
targeted people

11:49.609 --> 11:51.075
who've hurt the glades.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.243
Ford helped it.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.328
Then what the hell's the motive?

11:54.405 --> 11:55.580
Sure would help

11:55.590 --> 11:57.081
if we could ask directly.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.592
Wait. Hang on.

11:59.669 --> 12:01.419
You're... you're in contact?

12:01.430 --> 12:03.212
That was one time, all right?

12:03.289 --> 12:05.058
And count me out if we're
gonna roll up and arrest him.

12:05.082 --> 12:07.550
I'm not talking about the scpd.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.886
Just us. We just need to
talk to the new green arrow.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.313
You think he's
innocent. So we'll be fine.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.515
And what if we aren't?

12:14.592 --> 12:16.184
Then we deal with him.

12:16.260 --> 12:18.737
You should make the call.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.525
Hey.

12:24.602 --> 12:26.119
Got to say, I never appreciated

12:26.196 --> 12:27.695
how tightly you run this ship

12:27.772 --> 12:29.447
until you were gone
with the brass.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.365
It is so good to see you
behind that desk again, Lyla.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.367
Flatterer.

12:33.444 --> 12:35.628
Shut the door.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.624
What's going on?

12:39.634 --> 12:41.959
I had my contact look
into the image

12:41.970 --> 12:44.962
that Curtis decrypted
from the Malcolm byrd op.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.306
The "Dante" painting.

12:46.382 --> 12:47.965
It's being used as some sort of

12:47.976 --> 12:49.642
highly advanced
identification protocol

12:49.719 --> 12:51.302
within terrorist circles.

12:51.313 --> 12:52.970
Kobra, Basilisk,

12:52.981 --> 12:54.597
the third world
liberation army...

12:54.674 --> 12:57.099
They're all using the name
Dante like it's a contact.

12:57.176 --> 12:58.851
For what? Or for who?

12:58.928 --> 13:02.772
I don't know, but I might
know how to find out.

13:02.849 --> 13:04.774
When I cross-referenced
the terrorist groups

13:04.851 --> 13:06.984
with the financials that
we obtained in Geneva,

13:06.995 --> 13:08.611
I found a common account.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.279
Could you trace it?

13:10.356 --> 13:12.615
No. Come here. Look at this.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.169
Five transactions
in the past 7 months

13:16.246 --> 13:17.912
between Dante
and a consulting firm

13:17.989 --> 13:19.831
called rubrum,
silentium, and ursa.

13:19.841 --> 13:23.000
That's Latin for
"red," "silent," and "bear,"

13:23.011 --> 13:25.002
the longbow hunters.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.429
Look.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.145
You got to be kidding me.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.645
This is definitely the place.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.272
Then where is he?

13:44.348 --> 13:46.324
Maybe he got held up.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.036
Rene, stop.

13:50.113 --> 13:51.279
What are you talking about?

13:51.355 --> 13:52.697
There are motion detectors.

13:52.773 --> 13:54.332
We've been made.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.664
I said, come alone.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.666
These are my friends.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.668
You already met captain Drake.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.887
You can trust them.

14:07.964 --> 14:09.380
We only want to talk.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.798
I'll pass.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.675
A piece of advice

14:12.686 --> 14:15.052
from one green arrow to another:

14:15.063 --> 14:16.178
Cooperate.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.231
Because right now,

14:18.308 --> 14:19.702
most of the people
in this city think

14:19.726 --> 14:21.442
you're a killer.

14:23.146 --> 14:24.946
Are you?

14:27.391 --> 14:29.367
- Cut him off!
- On it.

15:05.638 --> 15:06.979
Mr. Queen. Mr. Queen, Mr. Queen,

15:07.056 --> 15:08.450
do you know who
the new green arrow is?

15:08.474 --> 15:09.618
Are you helping with
this investigation?

15:09.642 --> 15:11.233
I have no comment, guys.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.671
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What the hell is this?

15:12.695 --> 15:14.028
You all know the precinct
is off-limits.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.696
Captain Drake, care to comment?

15:15.773 --> 15:18.616
The scpd does not comment
on ongoing investigations.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.577
But I do. The vigilante
didn't do it.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.121
Ok. Can somebody please
get these guys out of here?

15:24.132 --> 15:26.123
Not helping.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.250
Hey. Why does the mayor
have to have all the fun?

15:28.327 --> 15:29.487
Maybe meeting at the precinct

15:29.545 --> 15:31.087
wasn't the best idea.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.432
Yeah. Well, I thought
the jig was up

15:32.456 --> 15:33.692
after you were spotted
last night.

15:33.716 --> 15:35.424
Oh, and speaking of last night,

15:35.501 --> 15:37.134
turns out we were right about
your green arrow clone.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.311
He is innocent.

15:38.388 --> 15:40.096
How do we know?

15:40.172 --> 15:41.533
Remember our second suspected
target, Clayton Ford?

15:41.557 --> 15:43.391
- Mm-hmm.
- My guys found him dead

15:43.467 --> 15:44.653
across town at the same time
we were chasing the vigilante.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.811
- We're his alibi.
- Ok.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.321
What do we know about
the Ford murder?

15:48.398 --> 15:49.939
Emerald arrow, center... chest,

15:50.016 --> 15:51.399
same as hutchinson.

15:51.475 --> 15:52.984
Someone's going
through a lot of trouble

15:52.994 --> 15:55.111
to pin this on
the new green arrow.

15:55.187 --> 15:58.164
We really need to come up
with a better name for him.

15:58.241 --> 16:00.825
He's making everyone,
including pollard,

16:00.835 --> 16:02.001
look away.

16:02.078 --> 16:03.336
The question is from what?

16:03.413 --> 16:04.879
Well, Ford may have known.

16:04.956 --> 16:06.508
He was trying to skip
town when he was killed.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.499
He found him with bags
packed and ready to go,

16:08.510 --> 16:09.750
clothes and cash.

16:09.827 --> 16:11.168
Yeah, he knew he was the target.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.712
What the hell is going on?

16:12.788 --> 16:15.348
Last time I checked,
Mr. Queen and Mr. Ramirez

16:15.425 --> 16:16.924
were not employed by the scpd.

16:17.001 --> 16:18.603
Well, they're just here
giving statements.

16:18.627 --> 16:20.803
That the vigilante didn't
do it. Yeah, I heard.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.055
You know, it's no big surprise

16:23.132 --> 16:24.910
that the old green arrow would
be supporting the new one,

16:24.934 --> 16:26.976
but I expected more from
my police captain.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.822
You telling me how to
conduct my investigation,

16:28.846 --> 16:29.979
Ms. Mayor?

16:30.056 --> 16:31.605
Because last I checked,

16:31.682 --> 16:33.366
I was still in control
of this precinct.

16:33.443 --> 16:35.818
I hired you to restore the
city's faith in this department.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.870
That means bringing that
vigilante to justice.

16:37.947 --> 16:39.697
And if you can't do that,

16:39.708 --> 16:42.041
I will find someone else
who can.

16:42.118 --> 16:43.993
She may be the tiniest,

16:44.070 --> 16:45.878
most unpleasant person
I've ever met.

16:45.955 --> 16:49.040
You have to listen
to her, but I don't.

16:49.116 --> 16:50.750
What are you thinking?

16:50.826 --> 16:52.126
It says here both victims were

16:52.203 --> 16:54.253
members of the same
society at Yale.

16:54.330 --> 16:56.839
I know a guy. Max Fuller,
he was a member, too.

16:56.916 --> 17:00.342
I could go see him,
gather some intel.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.603
I'll be in touch if I
learn anything, all right?

17:07.718 --> 17:14.231
Excuse me, Ms., uh, blackstar?

17:14.242 --> 17:15.858
Can we talk to you?

17:15.935 --> 17:17.568
I'm kind of busy.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.819
Clearly.

17:18.896 --> 17:19.987
We only need 5 minutes.

17:20.064 --> 17:22.457
Not interested.

17:26.945 --> 17:28.537
Like I said,

17:28.614 --> 17:30.381
I'd love to talk.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.043
So this whole fight club thing,

17:34.120 --> 17:36.879
you just beat people
up for what? Fun?

17:36.956 --> 17:38.714
Stress relief.

17:40.251 --> 17:41.891
Do you really want to
spend your 5 minutes

17:41.961 --> 17:43.552
talking about my hobbies?

17:43.629 --> 17:44.731
How do you know Felicity smoak?

17:44.755 --> 17:46.347
I don't.

17:46.423 --> 17:48.557
Well, that's strange,
because you were

17:48.634 --> 17:50.278
the last person she called
before she was killed.

17:50.302 --> 17:52.436
Felicity's dead?

17:52.447 --> 17:53.729
Oh, so you do know her.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.190
We worked together sometimes.

17:56.267 --> 17:57.450
What kind of work was that?

17:57.527 --> 17:59.568
The kind that's none
of your business.

17:59.645 --> 18:00.903
So, illegal.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.289
Well, you're one
to talk, canary.

18:03.366 --> 18:07.368
You're not as smart
as you think you are.

18:07.444 --> 18:09.286
But you want to come
in here and judge me?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.705
At least I'm not
lying to everyone,

18:11.782 --> 18:14.083
pretending to be
some kind of hero.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.968
At least I'm not a vigilante.

18:16.045 --> 18:18.546
You don't know what you're
talking about, kid.

18:18.622 --> 18:20.756
You know, you're part of
the reason star city is

18:20.833 --> 18:22.258
in the shape it's in right now.

18:22.334 --> 18:24.301
Really? 'Cause I could've sworn,

18:24.312 --> 18:26.303
the story goes,
it's because of you.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.639
Hey, just tell us why
Felicity called you.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.483
Then we'll leave you alone.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.823
I work as a broker.

18:36.899 --> 18:40.109
I help people find
certain items.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.443
Felicity asked me to find her

18:41.520 --> 18:42.653
an electrical firing circuit

18:42.664 --> 18:44.113
and a couple transmitters.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.489
Those are mechanisms for
triggering a bomb.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.158
I don't know why she needed 'em.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.160
I didn't ask.

18:49.236 --> 18:51.912
As long as I get paid, you can
ask for whatever you want.

18:51.989 --> 18:53.466
Sounds like you two had
a lot in common.

18:53.490 --> 18:55.675
If that's it, I have
my next fight coming up,

18:55.751 --> 18:57.343
and I really should stretch.

18:57.420 --> 18:59.637
Yeah. I'm done here anyway.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.683
Word of advice.

19:03.759 --> 19:06.936
Asking questions
about Felicity smoak

19:07.013 --> 19:10.231
will not end well for anyone.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.648
Five fully-stocked bars,

19:19.725 --> 19:20.983
3 private lounges,

19:21.060 --> 19:23.694
and the sound system is
the best...

19:23.705 --> 19:25.029
Outside of Europe.

19:25.105 --> 19:26.614
A.i. Adjusts
the acoustic environment

19:26.690 --> 19:27.781
based on capacity.

19:27.858 --> 19:29.783
Right this way here.

19:29.860 --> 19:32.369
That's a ton of security
you got down there, Max.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.547
It must be costing
you a fortune.

19:34.624 --> 19:36.843
Heh! Not when you pay for them
with crypto you mine yourself.

19:36.867 --> 19:38.551
All it costs me is
the little USB drive

19:38.628 --> 19:40.678
I put it on. Scotch?

19:40.755 --> 19:42.972
It's a 25-year.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.557
Why not?

19:44.634 --> 19:46.967
We can toast your new club.

19:47.044 --> 19:50.730
Hey. Toast to your new prison-
and green arrow-free life.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.809
It's really got to piss
you off, though, huh?

19:55.886 --> 19:58.562
Seeing some lame copycat
screw up

19:58.573 --> 20:00.072
everything you sacrificed for.

20:00.149 --> 20:02.024
I wanted to speak with you
about that.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.301
The last two murders weren't
connected to the vigilante.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.573
So the rumors are true.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.918
You are helping the cops
investigate this.

20:11.994 --> 20:13.535
How can I help?

20:13.612 --> 20:15.287
You were a member of
the scroll and key

20:15.364 --> 20:16.756
back at Yale.

20:16.832 --> 20:18.591
Allegedly.

20:18.668 --> 20:21.001
It is a secret society.

20:21.078 --> 20:22.261
Fair point.

20:22.338 --> 20:23.671
How well did you
know Clayton Ford

20:23.747 --> 20:24.922
and Sam hutchinson?

20:24.933 --> 20:26.423
Clay and hutch.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.217
Well enough to mourn them.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.677
Mm-hmm.

20:29.753 --> 20:31.553
But we'd sort of fallen
out of touch.

20:31.630 --> 20:34.431
Ford looked like he was
trying to skip town

20:34.442 --> 20:36.058
before he died,

20:36.135 --> 20:37.518
like he knew the hit was coming,

20:37.594 --> 20:39.103
but we just... we don't know how.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.813
You're looking for skeletons.

20:40.889 --> 20:42.481
And are we gonna find any?

20:42.558 --> 20:44.858
I know you're not supposed
to talk ill of the dead

20:44.935 --> 20:47.620
or whatever, but, you know,
there were always rumors

20:47.697 --> 20:49.446
that they had shady
business dealings going on

20:49.457 --> 20:52.241
with the triad, I believe.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.628
So who knows? Maybe they got
in over their heads.

20:55.705 --> 20:57.463
Probably.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.757
I won't take up any
more of your time.

21:01.952 --> 21:03.803
Thank you, Max.

21:03.879 --> 21:05.805
Mm-hmm.

21:05.881 --> 21:07.881
You mind if I ask you
a question?

21:07.958 --> 21:11.468
They sent you to prison
for helping this city.

21:11.479 --> 21:15.764
Why the hell should you
care about any of this?

21:15.841 --> 21:17.433
Old habits.

21:17.509 --> 21:21.895
I guess some people don't
change that much after all.

21:27.978 --> 21:29.236
Hey.

21:29.313 --> 21:30.313
Hey.

21:30.356 --> 21:32.239
Sorry I'm late.

21:32.316 --> 21:34.158
That's ok.

21:34.168 --> 21:37.003
I'm still getting used to
you coming home at all.

21:37.079 --> 21:39.288
How did things go with Fuller?

21:39.365 --> 21:40.956
Max Fuller is hiding something.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.499
Do you mind looking into it?

21:42.510 --> 21:44.668
Of course.

21:44.679 --> 21:48.630
Hey, you just came in
the front door,

21:48.707 --> 21:50.507
and none of my security
measures triggered.

21:50.518 --> 21:51.759
You sure?

21:58.008 --> 21:59.025
Felicity!

22:33.085 --> 22:34.426
Who are you?

22:34.503 --> 22:37.846
My husband asked you a question.

22:37.923 --> 22:39.056
Where'd you get that?

22:39.067 --> 22:41.233
We'll talk about it later.

22:41.310 --> 22:42.851
Stay down!

22:42.928 --> 22:44.403
Hey, hey.

22:58.235 --> 22:59.712
All right. As soon
as the doc gives the ok,

22:59.736 --> 23:01.829
we'll take him into
the station for questioning.

23:01.905 --> 23:03.080
In the meantime, we'll go through his
effects, see what we can find out.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.423
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.291
Oh, hey, and just
a bit of advice.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.377
Yeah.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.482
You probably shouldn't be shooting
people your first week out of prison.

23:10.506 --> 23:12.473
- That's a good tip.
- Yeah.

23:14.677 --> 23:17.010
He must've somehow
countered my alarm

23:17.087 --> 23:19.012
by sonically hacking
into the sensors.

23:19.089 --> 23:20.764
Felicity.

23:20.775 --> 23:22.433
That is a design flaw that
could take weeks to fix.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.268
- We need to talk about this.
- No. We need to be safe.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.664
This security system was
supposed to bring peace of mind.

23:25.688 --> 23:27.196
- You mean like owning a gun?
- Yeah.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.782
Where'd you even get a gun?

23:29.859 --> 23:31.617
Your best new friend Laurel?

23:31.694 --> 23:33.402
Of course not.

23:33.479 --> 23:35.362
I got it from your
ex-best friend, anatoly.

23:35.439 --> 23:37.573
You what?

23:37.649 --> 23:39.783
I've barely been gone 7 months,

23:39.794 --> 23:41.452
and you've aligned yourself

23:41.462 --> 23:43.120
with two of the most immoral
people we know?

23:43.131 --> 23:45.122
Oliver, you don't
get to judge me.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.593
You just shot a man in
our living room.

23:46.617 --> 23:48.208
Something you've done
a million times.

23:48.285 --> 23:49.918
Hey, this isn't you.

23:49.995 --> 23:53.088
You don't obsess over security.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.048
You certainly don't carry a gun.

23:55.125 --> 23:56.758
This is me, Oliver,

23:56.835 --> 23:58.480
not because I was influenced
by Laurel or anatoly.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.053
This is me because of you.

24:00.130 --> 24:01.930
You were the one that decided

24:02.007 --> 24:04.035
all on your own that you were
going to sacrifice yourself,

24:04.059 --> 24:06.268
leaving your son and your wife

24:06.345 --> 24:08.645
alone at home as
sitting ducks for Diaz.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.496
And the best part about
the whole thing is that

24:10.566 --> 24:12.285
you didn't even ask us about
how we felt about it.

24:12.309 --> 24:13.942
I've already apologized
for this.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.445
I don't know how many times
you need me to apologize.

24:16.522 --> 24:19.114
What am I supposed to do
with an apology, Oliver?

24:19.125 --> 24:21.167
I'm just supposed to move on?

24:21.243 --> 24:23.494
While you were gone,

24:23.504 --> 24:25.621
I had to figure out
how to survive.

24:25.697 --> 24:28.290
And I am glad that I did

24:28.367 --> 24:31.418
because the old me,
she was weak.

24:31.495 --> 24:33.554
How could you possibly
think that?

24:36.684 --> 24:39.468
The old you was the person
I fell in love with.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.187
Well...

24:43.173 --> 24:44.982
She's gone.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.402
And she's not coming back.

25:11.794 --> 25:13.719
I thought you didn't drink.

25:13.796 --> 25:15.546
Yeah, well, it's been
a tough week.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.431
I know the feeling.

25:19.668 --> 25:21.343
You know, Roy told me

25:21.420 --> 25:22.719
this would only bring me pain,

25:22.730 --> 25:24.888
and he was right.

25:27.050 --> 25:29.351
I'm going home.

25:29.428 --> 25:32.571
Just like that, huh,
without any answers?

25:32.648 --> 25:34.731
Felicity is dead.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.567
And before that, she had a plan
to blow up an entire city.

25:36.577 --> 25:39.152
So I'm not sure exactly
why I'm supposed to care

25:39.229 --> 25:40.821
about what happened to her.

25:40.897 --> 25:43.582
I'm just sorry I dragged
you all into this.

25:46.328 --> 25:48.254
You need to see something.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.542
It's called the Mark of four.

25:53.619 --> 25:55.219
Your dad came up with it.

25:55.296 --> 25:57.754
I don't remember that.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.515
You were already gone.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.642
It was right before everything.

26:03.462 --> 26:07.556
It symbolizes the 4 pillars
of heroism...

26:07.633 --> 26:14.396
Courage, compassion,
selflessness, and loyalty.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.773
We all got them as
a reminder that

26:16.784 --> 26:19.776
no matter what happened,
if one of us was in trouble,

26:19.787 --> 26:22.955
the other ones would be there.

26:23.032 --> 26:25.532
That's why Roy came with
you back to star city.

26:25.609 --> 26:29.077
He saw the symbol written on the
inside of your father's bow.

26:29.154 --> 26:31.413
So that's why you're helping us?

26:31.490 --> 26:34.416
I didn't know what to
make of you at first.

26:35.702 --> 26:38.920
Trust doesn't come
so easily to me.

26:38.997 --> 26:41.381
Yeah? So what changed?

26:41.458 --> 26:47.220
I started seeing the best
parts of your dad in you...

26:47.297 --> 26:51.433
The strength that
made him a hero.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.894
I am not that.

26:53.970 --> 26:55.812
You sure about that?

26:55.823 --> 27:01.818
'Cause your dad, he had this
way of looking into things,

27:01.829 --> 27:03.945
of seeing beyond the evidence.

27:04.022 --> 27:07.708
So what does your gut
tell you about blackstar?

27:11.697 --> 27:13.914
That she isn't telling
us the whole story.

27:13.990 --> 27:18.761
Good. Let's find out
what she's hiding.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.423
Hey, hey. Who's hungry?

27:23.500 --> 27:26.018
Ohh. You're a life saver.

27:26.095 --> 27:28.073
It's not often I get to buy
the police captain dinner.

27:28.097 --> 27:29.346
Yeah?

27:29.357 --> 27:31.523
Well, you'd better get
your fill in now

27:31.600 --> 27:33.361
because I probably won't
have this job much longer.

27:33.385 --> 27:36.478
Why? You don't think this
will blow over with pollard?

27:36.555 --> 27:38.522
Well...

27:38.532 --> 27:40.366
I don't know.

27:40.442 --> 27:43.035
You know, maybe it shouldn't.

27:43.112 --> 27:44.703
How can I really
be effective here

27:44.780 --> 27:47.114
if she's just gonna
undercut me the whole way?

27:47.190 --> 27:49.199
I'd be better off
as black canary.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.876
Whew. You don't know how long

27:50.953 --> 27:52.744
I've been waiting for you
to say that.

27:52.755 --> 27:56.331
But you're the best damn
person for this job, d.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.676
This city needs you here.

28:01.538 --> 28:02.879
Hey. How's it going
with the hit man?

28:02.890 --> 28:04.556
Good. He's still recovering,

28:04.633 --> 28:07.884
but we got an ID
thanks to a.R.G.U.S.

28:07.895 --> 28:11.471
Frank cassaday, otherwise
known as "the mirror."

28:11.548 --> 28:13.390
Specializes in kills
via mimicked m.O.

28:13.401 --> 28:14.850
Proof the vigilante
didn't do it,

28:14.926 --> 28:16.235
but who ordered the hits?

28:16.311 --> 28:18.228
Where'd you find that?

28:18.239 --> 28:20.199
I found that on cassaday.
Why? You recognize that?

28:21.933 --> 28:23.870
Fuller. He used those to pay
his muscle in the club.

28:23.894 --> 28:25.110
This was Fuller.

28:25.187 --> 28:27.028
He ordered the hit on hutchinson

28:27.105 --> 28:28.321
and then Ford and then me

28:28.398 --> 28:29.740
once I got too close.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.366
Why? I mean,
he's a rich douche bag,

28:31.377 --> 28:33.160
but I didn't peg him
to be a killer.

28:33.236 --> 28:34.828
Felicity ran
background on Fuller.

28:34.905 --> 28:36.422
He had secret business dealings

28:36.498 --> 28:37.923
with both hutchinson and Ford.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.258
If they were gonna cut him out,

28:39.334 --> 28:40.592
this was payback.

28:40.669 --> 28:42.210
All right. Well, the hit
on you failed,

28:42.287 --> 28:43.598
so that means Fuller's gonna
know something's up soon

28:43.622 --> 28:45.338
if he doesn't already, right?

28:45.415 --> 28:46.893
I'm gonna send s.W.A.T. In
while we still have

28:46.917 --> 28:48.091
the element of surprise.

28:48.102 --> 28:49.935
It's not that simple.

28:50.012 --> 28:52.345
Fuller's in there right now
with at least 12 hired guns,

28:52.422 --> 28:54.055
and the club is at capacity.

28:54.132 --> 28:55.307
So it could get really messy.

28:55.383 --> 28:57.526
Guys.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.566
It won't get messy

29:04.643 --> 29:06.952
if the green arrow goes
in... the o.G. One.

29:07.029 --> 29:12.115
No. I... i can't risk being
separated from my family,

29:12.126 --> 29:13.126
Rene.

29:13.202 --> 29:15.410
I can't do it.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.130
I might know a way you can.

29:18.207 --> 29:19.956
Even if you did,

29:19.967 --> 29:22.083
pollard would never
stand for it.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.418
Pollard wanted me to restore

29:23.495 --> 29:25.086
the city's faith in
this department,

29:25.163 --> 29:26.630
and that is never
gonna happen if we

29:26.640 --> 29:28.100
keep treating our heroes
like criminals.

29:28.124 --> 29:31.143
It's time the mayor
realizes that.

29:31.220 --> 29:35.597
Dinah, I trust you,
but you have to be sure.

29:35.674 --> 29:37.974
Half this city believes
in the vigilante

29:37.985 --> 29:39.818
because they were hoping
it was you.

29:39.895 --> 29:43.864
Now they don't have
to hope anymore.

29:47.903 --> 29:50.487
Ok.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.748
I need to make a pit stop.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.999
The bunker has seen better days.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.459
Yes, it has.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.419
It didn't seem right
coming back here

30:06.496 --> 30:08.138
after the team disbanded.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.008
Thanks for bringing this.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.852
The FBI still has mine.

30:13.929 --> 30:16.096
It's a good thing
you made another one.

30:16.172 --> 30:18.139
Yeah.

30:18.216 --> 30:20.016
Does that mean you
changed your mind

30:20.027 --> 30:22.018
about breaking
the cycle of violence?

30:22.029 --> 30:24.437
No.

30:26.275 --> 30:28.149
I cannot burden William
with this.

30:28.226 --> 30:32.538
But it's not just about
breaking the cycle of violence.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.700
It's about accountability.

30:36.710 --> 30:39.703
What does that mean to you?

30:39.713 --> 30:42.038
If star city wants
to hate the green arrow,

30:42.049 --> 30:44.132
that's fine.

30:45.535 --> 30:47.302
They'll have to hate me, too.

30:50.749 --> 30:52.549
You want some backup out there?

30:52.560 --> 30:55.352
Thank you, but this time,
I got to go solo.

30:57.306 --> 30:58.471
Hey.

30:58.548 --> 31:00.566
Yeah.

31:00.642 --> 31:03.485
Don't you need this?

31:05.573 --> 31:07.364
No.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.591
♪ Uh, do it
till they feel it... ♪

31:34.602 --> 31:36.509

31:38.088 --> 31:39.605
Where the hell are you?

31:41.591 --> 31:43.725
Listen, I want everyone
on high alert, ok?

31:43.802 --> 31:45.560

31:58.608 --> 32:00.450
Keep your men in position

32:00.461 --> 32:02.285
I don't want to tip our

Queen?

32:38.523 --> 32:41.041
Aah! Uh! Uh...

33:00.045 --> 33:03.397
Aah! Uh! Uh...

33:05.434 --> 33:07.192
♪ You don't hate me ♪

33:07.269 --> 33:08.860
♪ You hate you ♪

33:08.937 --> 33:10.979
♪ If you're looking for me,
I'm right here... ♪

33:11.056 --> 33:12.364
Oliver, do you have Fuller?

33:12.441 --> 33:14.649
I'm about to.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.576
♪ I'm right here, I'm right ♪

33:16.653 --> 33:18.194
♪ I'm right here, I'm right ♪

33:18.205 --> 33:19.988
♪ I'm right here! ♪

33:35.080 --> 33:36.129
Stay back!

33:36.206 --> 33:38.006
Drop the gun, Max.

33:38.017 --> 33:40.726
- I'll shoot.
- Hiring killers is easy.

33:44.139 --> 33:46.347
Taking the shot yourself isn't.

33:46.424 --> 33:49.234
Oh. You're a vigilante.

33:49.311 --> 33:51.519
You don't have the authority
to arrest me.

33:51.596 --> 33:52.854
She does.

33:52.931 --> 33:55.398
Max Fuller, you are under arrest

33:55.475 --> 33:57.025
for the murder of Clayton Ford

33:57.102 --> 33:58.651
and Sam hutchinson.

34:17.121 --> 34:19.556
Take Mr. Fuller into booking.

34:24.254 --> 34:26.262
Should I give you two a minute?

34:26.273 --> 34:28.690
We do this together.

34:30.426 --> 34:33.853
Ms. Mayor, to what do
I owe the pleasure?

34:33.864 --> 34:35.697
You've got some nerve.

34:38.059 --> 34:39.734
I want Mr. Queen booked

34:39.811 --> 34:41.360
in violation of
the anti-vigilante law.

34:41.437 --> 34:42.946
Hmm. Afraid I can't do that.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.364
Then I want your resignation.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.783
I think that would be a mistake.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.960
Oh, that's rich,
coming from the man

34:49.036 --> 34:50.954
who stared this city
in the face and lied.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.621
You made a mockery of city hall.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.966
I'm gonna show you that
no one is above the law.

34:55.043 --> 34:57.669
I could not agree with you more,

34:57.745 --> 35:00.588
which is why, as of
today, Mr. Queen

35:00.665 --> 35:03.424
is officially working
for the scpd.

35:03.501 --> 35:05.644
He's no longer a vigilante.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.720
I'll get that tossed
by this time tomorrow.

35:07.797 --> 35:09.606
Well, you can try, but
I have a strong feeling

35:09.683 --> 35:12.234
the district attorney is going
to side with me on this one.

35:17.348 --> 35:19.491
This isn't over,

35:19.568 --> 35:22.119
not even close.

35:30.028 --> 35:32.504
This should be fun.

35:38.512 --> 35:41.129
Got to warn you,
this one's a handful.

35:41.206 --> 35:42.589
We know.

35:42.665 --> 35:44.516
You sure you're good with this?

35:44.593 --> 35:47.352
Hiding the truth from
Oliver and Felicity? No.

35:47.429 --> 35:49.354
But this is the strongest
lead we've got.

35:49.431 --> 35:51.347
If we don't exploit it now,

35:51.358 --> 35:54.276
who knows how many people
will be hurt later?

35:56.363 --> 35:58.146
Open it.

36:00.701 --> 36:03.702
We'll take it from here.

36:09.234 --> 36:12.619
Hello, Mr. Diaz. Remember me?

36:12.695 --> 36:15.088
I'm sure you remember
my husband.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.885
What do you want?

36:26.251 --> 36:28.101
We need your help.

36:35.810 --> 36:37.810
Man. And I thought I was messy.

36:37.887 --> 36:40.363
How are we supposed to find
anything in this place?

36:51.734 --> 36:53.919
Guys!

36:58.425 --> 36:59.916
These are the bomb
schematics we found

36:59.927 --> 37:01.709
in Felicity's hideout.

37:01.786 --> 37:03.764
Blackstar knew about her
plan to blow up star city.

37:03.788 --> 37:06.422
Maybe she didn't just
know about it.

37:06.433 --> 37:07.933
Maybe she was part of it.

37:08.009 --> 37:10.051
Huh. If Felicity got cold feet,

37:10.128 --> 37:11.719
that's one hell of a motive
to kill her.

37:11.796 --> 37:13.388
Ok. But why hang on to these?

37:13.398 --> 37:15.440
I mean, why not
destroy the evidence?

37:15.517 --> 37:18.601
Because she's still
planning on using them.

37:18.612 --> 37:20.612
Ok, we have got to
go to the cops.

37:20.689 --> 37:22.188
The scpd are a joke.

37:22.265 --> 37:24.065
They'd love to watch

37:24.142 --> 37:25.784
star city go up in flames.

37:25.860 --> 37:28.620
Well, there is another option.

37:28.697 --> 37:30.196
We go to the glades.

37:30.273 --> 37:32.082
I thought we weren't
welcome there.

37:32.158 --> 37:35.576
Well, we're not, but she is.

37:35.653 --> 37:38.204
No. No way.

37:38.281 --> 37:40.164
Zoe, we don't know when or where

37:40.241 --> 37:41.841
this is going to happen, right?

37:41.918 --> 37:43.762
And by the time we find out,
it could be too late.

37:43.786 --> 37:46.137
I don't love the idea either,

37:46.214 --> 37:47.639
but we need resources.

37:52.670 --> 37:55.888
I guess it's time to
pay my dad a visit.

37:55.965 --> 37:59.475
With the successful
arrest of Max Fuller assisted

37:59.486 --> 38:03.321
by Oliver queen, the green arrow
will officially be working

38:03.398 --> 38:06.774
on the side of the law
hand in hand with the scpd,

38:06.851 --> 38:08.818
marking a new era for star city.

38:10.071 --> 38:11.237
Well...

38:11.314 --> 38:13.489
It looks like
you're famous again.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.825
Could you have
imagined 7 years ago

38:15.836 --> 38:18.161
that you'd be working unmasked
and alongside the cops?

38:19.572 --> 38:21.831
A lot has changed.

38:21.842 --> 38:23.925
Yeah.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.921
All those months at slabside,

38:28.998 --> 38:30.506
there wasn't a day that
went by...

38:30.517 --> 38:32.633
There wasn't an hour

38:32.710 --> 38:36.137
that went by I didn't think
about you and William and...

38:36.214 --> 38:38.681
Getting our life back.

38:38.692 --> 38:40.358
Me, too.

38:44.773 --> 38:46.531
Ok.

38:48.518 --> 38:50.243
So what's changed?

38:53.540 --> 38:55.707
I think time apart
forced us to move

38:55.784 --> 38:57.450
in different directions.

38:57.527 --> 38:59.952
Ok. But how do we...

39:00.029 --> 39:03.956
Start pushing in the same
direction again?

39:04.033 --> 39:05.541
I want to.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.001
Mm-hmm.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.795
But you're right.

39:08.871 --> 39:10.963
You know, I've changed...

39:11.040 --> 39:13.641
More than you know.

39:16.421 --> 39:17.845
I almost killed Diaz,

39:17.922 --> 39:19.305
and I would've killed him

39:19.382 --> 39:21.599
if Laurel hadn't stopped me.

39:21.676 --> 39:25.144
And I know that you're
gonna want

39:25.221 --> 39:26.621
to talk me down to
the old Felicity,

39:26.648 --> 39:28.981
the one that you met
chewing that red pen.

39:29.058 --> 39:31.317
While you were gone,

39:31.394 --> 39:33.578
I had to learn how
to protect myself.

39:35.824 --> 39:37.418
I put you in the position
where you had to do that,

39:37.442 --> 39:38.574
and I'm sorry.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.585
No. This isn't on you.

39:40.662 --> 39:43.204
Well... ok.

39:43.281 --> 39:46.165
I love you more than
a human being

39:46.242 --> 39:47.675
should love another human being.

39:50.121 --> 39:52.046
I just don't know

39:52.123 --> 39:53.598
if what's best for me
right now is

39:53.675 --> 39:57.644
the same thing
as what's best for us.

40:05.612 --> 40:08.271
Hey, dad, turns out Oliver
is more like you

40:08.281 --> 40:10.231
than I thought,

40:10.308 --> 40:12.233
more like me, too.

40:12.310 --> 40:14.944
But I'm not giving up,

40:14.955 --> 40:16.704
not ever.

41:31.865 --> 41:33.948
You failed.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.655
Why are you doing this?

41:40.731 --> 41:44.116
You did this to yourself.

41:44.127 --> 41:48.588
And now all of you will perish.

42:19.079 --> 42:20.411
Greg, move your head.
