WEBVTT

00:37.996 --> 00:39.080
Oh, God.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.333
Both Dale and Boomhauer
are going away on the same weekend.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.252
Sometimes I wish I was a worm,

00:44.335 --> 00:47.505
so I could cut myself in half
and crawl in both their suitcases.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.757
That'll do, Bill.

00:48.840 --> 00:49.799


00:51.259 --> 00:53.136
I'll see ya later, man.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.805
They're coming back, right, Hank?
Tell me they're coming back.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.892
Damn it, Bill,
we go through this every Memorial Day.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.394
Boomhauer will be back
from his family reunion

01:01.478 --> 01:02.353
before you know it.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.730
And even though Dale said

01:03.813 --> 01:08.234
he'd be back from his UFO convention
in 35 Romulan light-years,

01:08.318 --> 01:10.737
it really only amounts to three days.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.197
Well, amigos,

01:12.280 --> 01:14.157
I guess this is <i>au revoir.</i>

01:14.240 --> 01:15.575


01:15.658 --> 01:16.701


01:16.785 --> 01:19.412
Uh-oh. That could be a problem.
Better let me take a look at that.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.413
Don't bother.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.665
I'm sure it's just the engine.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.211
Look, you're going on a long trip.
I'll just take it for a test ride.

01:26.294 --> 01:27.378
Uh, that's okay.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.507
The commander of the Federation
is a mechanic at Pep Boys.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.925
He'll take a look at it.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.805
You, you are coming back,
aren't you, Hank?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.265
It's fine, Hank.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.350
She purrs like a kitten.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.018
See?

01:42.352 --> 01:43.311
Pipe down, Dale.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.480
I can't hear the...

01:45.563 --> 01:48.233
Now, come on, hit it, Gribble.
Go, go-go-go.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.359
Boomhauer?

01:49.442 --> 01:51.194
Dang ol'... H-Hank?

01:51.277 --> 01:52.445
Uh...

02:01.204 --> 02:03.331
So, all of your trips have been a lie?

02:03.414 --> 02:05.542
You guys were... fishing?

02:05.625 --> 02:09.170
Well, if your goal was to make
Bill Dauterive look like a fool,

02:09.254 --> 02:10.797
then you have succeeded.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.883
Bill, you have to believe me,
that wasn't our goal.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.635
It was just a by-product.

02:15.718 --> 02:18.096
Well, I won't stand for it.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.684
Again, by-product.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.521
It's just wrong, Peggy,

02:26.604 --> 02:29.482
ditching Bill like that for 18 years.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.277
The level of deception is unbelievable.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.444
Hank,

02:33.528 --> 02:36.281
you should get those guys
to throw my next surprise party.

02:36.364 --> 02:39.200
Well, I can understand
why they want a little vacation from him.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.327
He definitely gets on your nerves.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.830
But still, you just can't do that
to a guy.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.040
Uh, I guess I'll have to fix this.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.292
As usual.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.085
About my surprise party,

02:49.169 --> 02:51.045
make sure Boomhauer videotapes it.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.549
I want to see the look on my face
when I walk through that door.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.095
You sure about this, Hank?

02:59.179 --> 03:01.598
It's gonna be okay, Bill.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.434
Fellas, uh,

03:04.517 --> 03:06.644
Bill and I enjoy fishing, too.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.814
And if it would be all right,
we'd like to come, too.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.610
-Well, you know, talkin' 'bout ol'...
-Uh... Jeez...

03:13.693 --> 03:16.529
Look, I promise I'll keep him in line.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.116
Sure, why not?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.285
Oh, thank you for including me, fellas.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.746
It makes me feel... special.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.289
Yeah, screw it.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.249
We might as well invite the whole world.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.876
You know, wives and kids.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.545
But I wanted this trip

03:32.629 --> 03:33.838
to be just the four of...

03:33.922 --> 03:35.256
Keep it in check, Bill.

03:38.092 --> 03:40.720
Mom, I found my beach shirt.

03:40.803 --> 03:44.098
Can you believe
it was in Dad's rag bucket?

03:51.272 --> 03:54.692
Boomhauer, I'd move from behind this truck
if I were you.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.904
Ah, wait, the guy behind us
is talking on a cell phone.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.406
Might as well have a bottle of whiskey
in his mouth.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.200
You'd better switch back.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.869
Gummi Foot, anyone?

04:04.953 --> 04:08.373
Just one of the many perks
of riding in the A car.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.540
You hear that, Bill?

04:09.624 --> 04:11.251
You're in the A car.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.545
Hey, what do y'all think is going on
in the B car?

04:15.046 --> 04:16.172
Probably something boring.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.382
You got that right.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.467
Women and their conversations.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.178
Reality TV is so wonderful.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.513
Yeah, man, talkin' 'bout ol'...

04:23.596 --> 04:25.181
I've been using little-little

04:25.265 --> 04:26.683
ol' apricot scrub.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.851
Takin' years off your face, man,
that ol' skin.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.980
With these new maxi-pads,

04:32.063 --> 04:34.774
I feel confident enough to ride a bicycle.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.734
Damn it, Bill.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.862
You just ruined
a perfectly good comedy routine.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.155
-But I...
-You made it dirty,

04:41.239 --> 04:43.241
and ruined the fun for everybody.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.575
Sorry, Hank.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.286
Now I don't even get a turn.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.705
I have to go to the bathroom.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.831
Hold it.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.125
Number two.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.210
Pull over, Boomhauer.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.257
Uh, n-not the Gasco, the Shamrock.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.346
What's with all the beer?

05:05.430 --> 05:08.182
Oh, uh, the price was too good to pass up.

05:08.266 --> 05:11.519
I guess one of you is gonna have
to ride in the B car.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.271
Dibs.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.398
Okay, this is your chance.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.276
Don't slobber and don't wipe
your hands on the seat.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.320
Church rules-- gotcha.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.573
And for dinner, I have a Greek salad,
which is eight net carbs,

05:23.656 --> 05:26.367
a steak the size of my fist, 11 net carbs,

05:26.451 --> 05:28.578
and all the sugar-free gelatin I want.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.039
So, that's Wednesday.
Now, what about Thursday?

05:31.122 --> 05:33.916
Well, Thursday is the same
exact menu as Tuesday,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.251
but I'll go through it anyway.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.087
I wake up to egg whites
and salsa-- two net carbs.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.089
Oh, God.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.300
Hey, dude, check out my eyelids.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.815
Uh-oh. We're out of potato chips.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.817
Well, I'm sorry,
but you'll just have to wait

05:59.901 --> 06:01.694
-till I go shopping.
-Give me the list.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.695
I can go to the store.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.114
Sorry, Bobby.
This isn't one of your video games

06:05.198 --> 06:08.034
where if you lose the grocery money,
you can kill someone and get it back.

06:08.117 --> 06:11.662
Please. It's one less thing for you to do.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.916
Fine. Here's $100.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.126
You are not to deviate from the list,
mister.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.712
And I am counting the change.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.924
Where are the guys?
They were right behind us.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.551
Well, when I left,
Bill took charge of the map.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.387
So, they probably got lost.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.640
<i>♪ Dee-dee-dum-dum ♪</i>

06:30.723 --> 06:33.434
<i>♪ Dumpty-dumpty, dum-dum-dum squank ♪</i>

06:35.978 --> 06:37.814
What the heck happened to you guys?

06:37.897 --> 06:40.441
Well, man, dang ol' bonehead here
got us lost, man.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.984
I thought we'd make better time

06:42.068 --> 06:44.695
by taking this blue highway
I found on the map.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.030
It was a river.

06:46.447 --> 06:49.325
All right, look, guys,
Bill didn't mean to screw up.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.536
Are you kidding? Bill was great.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.870
If we hadn't gotten lost,

06:52.954 --> 06:56.040
we never would've eaten
the best tacos in the world.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.127
Or gotten these great Tico's Tacos hats.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.753
Tico's Tacos?

07:00.837 --> 07:02.422
Yeah, yeah, I know, Hank.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.091
Unscheduled stop got us behind schedule,

07:05.174 --> 07:07.093
could have given us stomach larvae.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.804
But you gotta hear
what Bill told the cashier.

07:09.887 --> 07:14.642
Well, I just said, "If it's nacho cheese,
then whose is it?"

07:18.729 --> 07:20.314
Probably h-had to be there, man.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.067
"Nacho cheese."

07:24.068 --> 07:26.154
Huh. I don't know what changed.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.781
When I was in the car,
everything was so tense.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.327
-Nacho...
-Ah, Bill.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.414
-Huh.
-Wait. I see what's going on here.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.834
Yeah, all these years,
it wasn't Bill they were avoiding.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.377
It was me.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.380
Oh. I just got that "nacho cheese" joke.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.590
But you think so?

07:45.673 --> 07:46.841
That's terrible.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.096
Hah.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.975
Is that all you got, fat man.

07:57.935 --> 07:58.895
Hank...

07:58.978 --> 08:03.816
stop pretending to fix things that are,
A, not ours and B, not broken.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.693
Now, go out there with your friends.

08:05.776 --> 08:09.238
Huh. Maybe I should try
some 3-in-1 Oil on this.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.574
I know what's going on here.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.577
Your feelings are hurt
because sometimes your friends

08:14.660 --> 08:18.080
have a better time without you
than they do with you.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.249
But that doesn't mean they don't like you.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.920
It just means you might have
to change your behavior just a little bit.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.548
What do you mean change my behavior?

08:27.632 --> 08:28.799
It's not a big deal,

08:28.883 --> 08:32.136
but sometimes, you have a tendency
to, you know,

08:32.220 --> 08:35.014
be a little bossy with the guys.
Just sometimes.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.140
Bossy?

08:36.224 --> 08:37.517
If I wasn't "bossy,"

08:37.600 --> 08:39.727
those guys would be in trouble
all the time.

08:39.810 --> 08:42.396
Yes, but nobody likes
being mothered all the time.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.898
Except for Bobby.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.441
He really responds to it.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.776
So, what are you saying?

08:46.859 --> 08:49.070
Uh, just go with the flow.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.280
Let the guys be in charge
of this vacation.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.741
Who knows? Maybe you'll have fun, too.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.953
And just keep my mouth shut
when they do something stupid?

08:57.036 --> 08:59.247
Well, what kind of friend would I be then?

08:59.330 --> 09:02.458
Damn it, Hank. Do you want
a Tico's Tacos hat or not?

09:04.001 --> 09:04.877
Yes.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.631
Dude, see that girl sunbathing
with her top unhooked?

09:08.714 --> 09:10.508
You drop this crab on her back,

09:10.591 --> 09:13.469
and when she jumps up,
I'll look at her boobage.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.222
Joseph, put the crab down.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.768
Hey, check it out.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.019
Cool.

09:22.103 --> 09:26.440
Dude, with one of those metal detectors,
we could, like, make tons of money.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.900
We got to buy one.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.652
We can use the cash your mom gave you.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.237
But it's for groceries.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.532
And I told her I was going
to be responsible with the money.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.076
We can turn your mom's hundy
into a fortune.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.622
It'd be irresponsible for us
not to get it.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.543
Hmm. You make a lot of good points.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.131
Stop fussing with my tail.
Just make me a wig out of seaweed.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.466
Uh, hey, there... guys.

09:53.884 --> 09:54.969
Oh, hey, Hank.

09:55.052 --> 09:58.139
Um, we just got a little sidetracked
in loading the boat.

09:58.222 --> 10:01.225
No, uh, looks like you guys
are having a blast.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.810
Here, let me help.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.687
Uh...

10:06.188 --> 10:07.148
Uh...

10:07.815 --> 10:08.774
Yep.

10:08.858 --> 10:12.028
Hey, man, look at that dang ol' Hank
getting into it, man.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.408
So, uh, which one is our boat?

10:17.491 --> 10:18.409
The Queeg.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.204
That sure is a lot of boat.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.832
Look, um, Hank, truth is,

10:25.082 --> 10:27.710
Boomhauer and I don't come here to fish.

10:28.836 --> 10:31.297
We come here to... to search for...

10:31.797 --> 10:33.257
sunken treasure.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.509
-Huh.
-Isn't it great, Hank?

10:35.593 --> 10:37.094
We're gonna be millionaires.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.306
To be accurate, Bill,
we'll be millionarios.

10:40.598 --> 10:44.602
You see, in 1898,
the Spanish frigate <i>Juan Sebastian</i>

10:44.685 --> 10:46.354
was sunk in these waters.

10:46.437 --> 10:51.025
Its cargo, 50,000 gold pesetas,
was never recovered.

10:51.108 --> 10:54.278
Through our exhaustive efforts
over the last 20 years,

10:54.362 --> 10:58.199
Boomhauer and I have determined
exactly where it isn't.

10:58.949 --> 11:03.496
But the ocean, she can't hold
her secrets much longer.

11:03.829 --> 11:04.955
Yo, man.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.248
Uh...

11:06.624 --> 11:07.833
sounds fun.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.836
I'm gonna go get my sunblock.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.755
Hmm.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.217
They're looking for sunken treasure
for God's sake.

11:16.300 --> 11:20.471
I-I understand it sounds a little stupid,
but that's not the point.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.306
Don't you want to hang out
with your friends?

11:22.390 --> 11:24.016
All right.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.227
As long as you think it's stupid, too.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.481
Go. Fly, little bird.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.900
Bobby, where are the groceries?

11:32.983 --> 11:35.528
Mom, you are gonna be so proud of me.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.906
I took some initiative
and invested our food money

11:38.989 --> 11:40.366
in this.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.243
A metal detector?

11:42.326 --> 11:44.537
Yeah, we're gonna be rich.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.831
Bobby...

11:46.914 --> 11:48.666
you are a genius.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.505
Treasure hunt.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.965
I'm on a treasure hunt.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.050
And we're past the breaker.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.804
Mr. Boomhauer, set a course
for 26 degrees North,

12:01.887 --> 12:04.849
-97 degrees West.
-Yeah, man.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.851
Yeoman-Purser Dauterive,

12:06.934 --> 12:10.604
go below deck and fetch me
the Igloo cooler from the galley.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.648
Yes, Captain, my Captain.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.359
So, uh, what do we do now?

12:15.443 --> 12:17.027
Do we all put on dive helmets

12:17.111 --> 12:20.906
and look for a big wooden chest
with a lock on it?

12:20.990 --> 12:24.577
No. What we do is,
we put the boat on auto-pilot

12:24.660 --> 12:26.579
and wait for the sonar to find something.

12:26.662 --> 12:27.872
But while we're killing time,

12:27.955 --> 12:31.208
we might as well soak up some rays
and catch some fish.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.251
Oh.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.419
Well, all right.

12:39.383 --> 12:40.217
Fly.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.679
Joseph, honey, that fish
doesn't want to play.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.348
Dale and Boomhauer think
they're gonna find treasure.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.516
Ridiculous.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.393
We're the ones
who are gonna find treasure.

12:52.646 --> 12:53.814
A gold earring.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.066
I bet it belonged to a pirate.

12:56.150 --> 12:59.195
Uh, actually, that's mine.
I must have just dropped it.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.155
What the hell you think you're doing?

13:02.406 --> 13:04.116
This beach is for locals only.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.284
Mom.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.244
Bobby, I've got this under control.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.622
Always good to meet a fellow metal-head.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.582
Quite a lot of keys you've got there.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.959
You must be a very important man.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.629
One of them starts my truck.
I found the rest.

13:16.712 --> 13:17.630
They're my trophies.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.883
Oh, well if we find any more,
we'll send them right your way.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.636
I said this beach is for locals only.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.514
This is a public beach, sir.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.308
We all have the right
to find other people's belongings

13:29.391 --> 13:30.476
and claim them as our own.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.228
All right then, Juris Prudence.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.438
You can scan the beach, but we go first.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.523
Right of First Sweep.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.066
We don't have to listen to you...

13:37.149 --> 13:40.069
All right, all right! You get first sweep.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.658
Gentlemen, time for Russian Beer-lette.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.661
One of these cans has been shaken.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.789
One...

13:52.248 --> 13:53.332
...two...

13:53.415 --> 13:56.126
three, go!

13:56.210 --> 13:58.170
-He got...
-He got you, man.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.463
It's not funny.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.340
Here, Dale, take mine.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.842
I'll go get another one.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.056
Oh, my God, we're rich.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.642
Oh, it's the phone. What?

14:11.725 --> 14:13.185
Peggy, you were right.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.645
You were right about everything.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.273
I know, Hank, but I need you
to be more specific.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.399
The treasure hunt.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.651
The guys have everything under control,

14:20.734 --> 14:22.945
and I'm just laying back,
and it's a blast.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.655
See, I knew it would all work out.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.825
Now, c'mon, man. Bill, do a little
of them dang ol' cannonball, man.

14:33.122 --> 14:36.458
That's not a cannonball.
I'll show you a cannonball.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.961
Sha!

14:40.379 --> 14:43.132
Oh, these guys
are a bunch of crazy nuts,

14:43.215 --> 14:46.051
I'll tell ya what. I got to go.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.641
Come on, Hank. Cannonball.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.102
-Cannonball. Cannonball.
-Yeah, man, dang ol' cannonball...

14:55.185 --> 14:56.520
Cannonball.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.688
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

14:57.771 --> 14:59.189
There he goes.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.110
Yeah.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.528
Woo.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.779
I got to tell you guys.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.324
I don't know the last time
I had this much fun.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.910
Yeah, this may be the best trip ever.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.996
So, should we swim around
to the other side?

15:14.079 --> 15:15.873
Why? Is that some sort of a game?

15:15.956 --> 15:18.834
Uh, no.
So we can climb back up the ladder.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.420
What are you talking about?
The ladder's right there.

15:22.004 --> 15:25.257
But, fellas, how are we
gonna get back in the boat?

15:26.842 --> 15:28.260
Dang, man.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.936
There's gotta be a way back up.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.479
No, there's not.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.273
How are we gonna get back up
without the ladder?

15:41.357 --> 15:43.233
Gonna dang ol' die, man. Just ol' die.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.485
No one panic.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.445
In times of extreme duress,

15:46.528 --> 15:49.531
the body human is often imbued
with super strength.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.868
I'll dive deep into the water,
and shoot up to the surface,

15:52.952 --> 15:54.787
propelling myself onto the boat.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.331
Gentleman, I'll see you shipside.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.294
Shazaam!

16:02.753 --> 16:05.798
Huh. I must've jumped clean over the boat.

16:06.715 --> 16:07.800
We're doomed.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.553
Hoo-hah.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.973
A charm bracelet and a cigarette lighter.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.225
Oh, yeah, up top.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.685
This stinks.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.520
Maybe we should just go swimming.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.021
Hey, Joseph.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.985
No way. We sunk all our food money
into this.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.070
Your father will think we're idiots.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.697
Okay, here's what we'll do.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.366
We'll tell your father
we were beaten up and robbed.

16:32.449 --> 16:33.701
Now punch me in the chin.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.413
Mom, I'm not gonna...

16:39.373 --> 16:41.417
Ho-yes.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.337
What is wrong with you guys?

16:45.421 --> 16:48.007
Jumping off a boat
without lowering the ladder?

16:48.090 --> 16:49.800
Hey, you jumped off, too.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.302
How do you explain that, Albert Hankstein?

16:52.386 --> 16:54.513
I can't believe I'm gonna die

16:54.596 --> 16:56.098
because of you, knuckleheads.

16:56.181 --> 16:59.309
Prepare for an eternity of me
kicking your ass.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.730
Hey, man, the dang ol' last man
pull up the dang ladder, man.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.856
Easy, Boomhauer.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.608
You're not exactly smelling like roses,
either.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.111
If you hadn't goaded Bill
into cannonballing,

17:09.194 --> 17:12.364
this deadly chain of events
never would have been unleashed.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.116
I only did what I was told.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.868
Hey, man, dang ol' screw you, Gribble.

17:15.951 --> 17:20.372
Oh, blame the blamer.
Classy, guys. Real classy.

17:32.926 --> 17:33.927
Hey!

17:34.011 --> 17:35.512
Hey!

17:35.596 --> 17:38.390
Dale, they can't see you.
Conserve your energy.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.059
I'm getting so tired.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.978
I'm just gonna close my eyes
for a minute...

17:43.062 --> 17:45.230
-Bill. Stay awake.
-Hey, man, I did it, man.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.566
I dang ol', broke off the dang
ol' propeller, man.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.026
Boomhauer, why'd you do that?

17:49.109 --> 17:51.028
There's gasoline everywhere.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.613
Uh... I dunno, man.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.496
The only way we're gonna make it
through this is if we stay together.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.707
Now everyone, get near the boat,
it's easier to spot.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.793
I said get next to the boat.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.384
There's gotta be something we can do.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.512
I suppose now would be a good time

18:16.595 --> 18:18.806
if anybody had anything
to get off their chest.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.392
You know, before we meet our maker?
Or "make-ress?"

18:22.476 --> 18:24.269
Hey, man, dang I, I do, man.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.646
Dang ol' talkin' 'bout...

18:25.729 --> 18:28.857
well, you know, man,
I, I dye my dang ol' hair, man.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.402
I have one, too.

18:32.694 --> 18:33.862
We lied to you, Hank.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.907
Once you left the A car,
it was a disaster.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.576
We were at each other's throats
the whole time.

18:39.660 --> 18:43.455
But what about your crazy taco adventure?
And the hats?

18:43.539 --> 18:44.873
We didn't have fun.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.959
We were too embarrassed to tell you.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.378
And Bill never said "nacho cheese."

18:49.461 --> 18:52.005
It was a joke I got off a Popsicle stick.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.716
Hey, man. You know,
you're the dang ol' glue, Hank.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.511
Huh. Well, I, I appreciate that, fellas.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.596
I have a confession, too, Hank.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.641
In a moment of weakness,
on a dark, rainy night...

19:02.724 --> 19:04.101
I slept with Peggy.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.228
-No, you didn't, Bill.
-I know.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.313
Well, smoke 'em if you got 'em.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.613
Wait, wait, give me that cigarette.

19:16.697 --> 19:20.367
Never. You'll have to pry it
from my cold, dead hands.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.660
Come back in five minutes.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.746
No, we can light the gas spill.
It'll start a huge fire.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.331
Maybe that helicopter will see it.

19:26.707 --> 19:30.794
It's not a bad plan...
but this is my last cigarette.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.713
-Come on, Dale.
-Man, go and do it, man.

19:32.796 --> 19:36.884
Okay, but if this doesn't work,
I sure hope they have cigarettes in hell.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.640
He sees us.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.100
He sees us. Yeah.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.476
-Whoo-hoo!
-All right.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.105
-Yeah, man, yeah. Hey.
-Yeah!

19:50.189 --> 19:51.899
Whoo-hoo-hoo. Good work, kids.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.066
Best day we've had

19:53.150 --> 19:55.569
since those bales of marijuana
washed up on shore.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.738
Wait. Where's my, uh...

19:57.821 --> 19:58.906
Looking for these?

19:58.989 --> 20:00.824
Oh. Thanks. Must've dropped them.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.202
Uh-uh. Metal detector's code.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.954
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.040
Dang, she's savvy.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.583
Here's our proposition.

20:09.666 --> 20:13.170
We'll swap your car keys
for everything you found today.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.550
You're one tough beach-comber.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.721
Uh-uh. And the Star of David.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.935
Mr. Hill, I gotta hand it to you.
That was pretty smart thinking.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.686
We saw that fire from quite a ways.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.814
No, I'm just the one
who forgot to lower the ladder.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.651
Boomhauer's the one
who broke open the gas line.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.820
Dale's the one who always carries
an emergency match.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.155
And Bill... uh...

20:40.239 --> 20:43.450
Well, Bill didn't make things worse.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.078
Nice try, Hank. We know we're screw-ups.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.664
If it wasn't for you,
we would have been dead years ago.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.252
Now that we laughed in the face of death,

20:53.335 --> 20:56.296
I suggest we bring
a little small-town justice

20:56.380 --> 20:58.090
-into that biker bar.
-No.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.592
Hey, let's go play chicken on jet skis.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.510
No.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.887
Am I hungry, Hank?
Because I feel hungry.

21:04.304 --> 21:07.808
Well, we haven't eaten
in a while, so... yes.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.349
-<i>Nacho cheese.</i>
