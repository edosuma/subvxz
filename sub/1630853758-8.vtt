WEBVTT

00:08.132 --> 00:15.057
"So in conclusion, I do not believe
that Nikki and Jason are the correct match

00:15.057 --> 00:16.225
for Princess and Tyler."

00:18.519 --> 00:19.811
Well, that was thorough.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.439
Look, it's not that bad. It's...

00:22.523 --> 00:25.108
Jase, it was dark
when you started reading it.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.069
Is she really gonna say that in court?
-Yep.

00:27.653 --> 00:30.405
Yeah.
-I don't believe this.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.491
Yeah.
-What does that even mean?

00:32.573 --> 00:34.535
Does that mean we're gonna lose the kids?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.578
Well, they're not ours to lose, are they?
Not yet.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.206
Let's see what happens
at the hearing today.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.543
Three months ago,
I thought we were gonna get the kids.

00:42.543 --> 00:46.755
I thought we were gonna get married.
I thought we were gonna live in this flat.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.674
And now--
-Nothing is gonna stop us

00:48.674 --> 00:50.801
from getting married. Okay?
Even if we're homeless.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.262
I actually quite like outdoor weddings,
so...

00:53.262 --> 00:58.851
I just really had a vision, you know?
Just of the kids being there.

00:59.476 --> 01:00.310
Well...

01:02.312 --> 01:05.147
let's just hope
we don't lose them then. Hey.

01:07.609 --> 01:08.902
It's not a wedding without kids.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.696
You're thinking of Christmas, but okay.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.866
You want a cup of tea?
-I'd love a cup of tea.

01:22.749 --> 01:23.750
Do you know what?

01:29.173 --> 01:31.133
Let's do it.
-Do what?

01:32.009 --> 01:33.010
Get married.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.261
What?

01:34.261 --> 01:35.429
Let's get married.

01:36.013 --> 01:39.349
We've already been through this.
I already said yes.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.601
It's not a driver's license.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.729
You don't need to reapply.
-No, I mean today.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.357
What are you talking about?
-Let's get married.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.610
Let's get married today
while we've still got the kids.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.572
Why not? I've still got the license
from when I asked you three months ago.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.533
Are you being serious?

01:56.617 --> 01:59.494
Look, we want them to be there. Right?

02:00.787 --> 02:05.083
And this might be the last day that--
Forget it. I'm being silly.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.586
Forget it. It's all right.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.465
Okay.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.550
Really?

02:14.510 --> 02:16.553
Yeah. Let's do it. I wanna do it.
-Yeah?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.139
Yeah? Okay.
-I wanna do it!

02:19.223 --> 02:21.558
But we've got a court hearing at 3:30.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.186
How are we gonna arrange
a wedding before 3:30?

02:24.186 --> 02:26.188
Well, we've got two little helpers,
haven't we?

02:27.606 --> 02:30.609
Absolutely. Yeah, no. I'm happy to hold.

02:31.610 --> 02:35.322
Wake up! Everybody, wake up!

02:36.698 --> 02:39.159
So, guys, are you feeling a bit crazy?

02:39.243 --> 02:40.827
No.
-No.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.580
Okay.
-Yeah. Okay, understood.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.917
Yes.
-It's 'cause we wanna get married today!

02:46.917 --> 02:49.253
All right, yeah. Keep that.
We'll take that. Thank you so much.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.213
Brilliant.
Listen, they've got a slot at 1:30

02:51.213 --> 02:53.131
because Emily and Paul have broken up!

02:53.215 --> 02:54.424
Yes!
-Yes!

02:55.634 --> 02:56.969
So, who's in charge of what?

02:56.969 --> 02:58.512
Outfits!
-And food!

02:58.512 --> 02:59.596
Okay then.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.349
So, you're doing outfits.
You're doing food.

03:02.349 --> 03:07.062
What are we waiting for?
Let's go and get married!

03:07.062 --> 03:08.856
Come on, kids. Let's go brush our teeth.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.863
Outfits?
I mean, outfits are the whole thing.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.323
It'll be okay.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.884
Okay. Your dad said he'll meet us.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.635
All right. Great.
Listen, in terms of rings,

03:38.719 --> 03:39.970
don't think we've got the money,

03:39.970 --> 03:41.847
or the time to be able
to get anything that we--

03:41.847 --> 03:42.931
No, I don't care about rings.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.308
That's not important.
-Okay, good.

03:44.933 --> 03:45.934
Here we are!

03:47.769 --> 03:50.105
Don't tell them it's for a wedding.
They double the price for weddings.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.857
Okay. Come in, you.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.068
Hiya.
-Hi.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.323
Sadly, we have an unexpected funeral.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.407
I'm sorry.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.326
Yeah, so we need
just some flowers quickly.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.620
Sure. Yeah.
-I don't suppose you have anything

04:04.620 --> 04:06.705
just like cheery and bright?

04:08.165 --> 04:11.084
It's what he would have wanted.
-Sure. Yeah.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.588
Ellie? Can you show this lady
some hellebores, please?

04:14.588 --> 04:15.881
Thank you.
-Okay.

04:20.469 --> 04:21.470
You okay?

04:21.470 --> 04:24.348
Yeah. Good. Thank you very much.
Yeah. All good.

04:24.348 --> 04:25.849
It was all quite quick, I hear.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.686
Yeah. It was about an hour ago now, so...

04:32.064 --> 04:35.484
Was it peaceful, at least?
-Not really. No. The kids were screaming.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.070
To be honest, it's something
we've been thinking about for a while,

04:38.070 --> 04:40.239
so it does feel good to finally...

04:40.739 --> 04:41.823
pull the trigger. You know?

04:41.907 --> 04:43.367
Now stop talking to her, please.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.869
These are perfect. Thank you. Yeah.
-Sure.

04:48.664 --> 04:52.084
Okay, so, 45 for those ones.

04:52.084 --> 04:56.505
Right. Any discounts for funerals?

04:57.256 --> 04:58.882
I could do them for 40?

04:58.966 --> 04:59.967
Oh, yeah. Great.

05:02.553 --> 05:05.389
Okay, so, flowers are done.

05:05.389 --> 05:08.767
Come on. Bring it in. There you go.
All right, let's get going! Come on!

05:13.647 --> 05:16.191
There he is. Hello!

05:16.275 --> 05:18.443
Hello!
-Hi.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.823
Thank you, Vic. It's just much easier
if we split up, so we'll meet you there.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.617
Okay, so these two are
in charge of outfits and food.

05:25.701 --> 05:28.287
No, food and outfits!
-No! Food and outfits!

05:28.287 --> 05:30.747
I don't know what we're doing,
but I suppose we'll get on and do it.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.999
Come on.
-Yeah, you two. Okay.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.209
Bye!
-All right then. So...

05:34.293 --> 05:37.087
Okay, no. Jase, I really shouldn't
be seeing you before we get married.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.547
It's bad luck.
-What are you talking about?

05:38.547 --> 05:39.923
We've been looking at each other all day.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.050
No. Actually, I've been blurring
my eyes since about 9:00,

05:42.134 --> 05:44.011
but now I've got a headache,
so we should split up.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.222
I'm gonna go and find something blue,

05:47.306 --> 05:49.016
something borrowed,
something new and something old.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.893
I've never heard it in that order,
but good luck with it.

05:50.893 --> 05:54.104
Will you make sure you invite everyone?
-Don't worry. I'm on it.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.606
Open your eyes.
-I'm so sorry!

05:55.606 --> 05:57.232
No!
-Open your eyes.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.902
I'll meet you back here in an hour.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.361
Okay?
-Okay. Bye!

06:07.117 --> 06:10.078
The wedding's at 1:30,
and the hearing's at 3:30.

06:10.162 --> 06:13.916
I don't have that long,
so literally anything borrowed is fine.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.542
No, I'll find them.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.588
Mazel tov.
-Thank you.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.590
I'm in a bit of a rush, Scott.
-I've written you a poem.

06:21.590 --> 06:26.303
Oh, please no. No way. That's amazing.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.596
Isn't it? Yes.
-Yes.

06:27.596 --> 06:33.101
And I have hung up my quill,
so to speak. So this is my last one.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.481
I want you to have it. Serving suggestion.

06:37.481 --> 06:42.945
Pair it with Vivaldi and a nice glass
of Cognac. Nothing after 2005.

06:43.946 --> 06:45.113
And speaking of toasts.

06:45.197 --> 06:49.243
I don't think there's anything
more satisfying than a toast

06:49.243 --> 06:51.328
from a glass you've blown yourself.

06:51.828 --> 06:55.541
Scott, I did tell you I would work in
that you've been to a glass-blowing class.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.334
You don't need to do that.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.502
Understood.

07:00.546 --> 07:01.672
Right.

07:03.799 --> 07:04.925
I found them.

07:10.264 --> 07:13.225
What are these?
-My earrings. Something borrowed.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.143
These are mine. You stole these.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.188
I did not!
-Karen, how long have you had these for?

07:18.272 --> 07:19.273
I can't believe you.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.483
I have been asking you--
-I want you to be godmother.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.496
I know you only did that to change
the subject, but I really don't care.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.170
And don't read the poem out loud.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.838
There's, like, five lines
from Keats in there.

07:42.838 --> 07:45.549
Fine. This can be
my something borrowed then.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.759
I just need something new.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.731
Something new.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.525
Yeah, no, I got that.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.871
I hate this.
I mean, they all look the same.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.916
The rings are my favorite bit.
I love a big gesture.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.542
It was the little gestures I couldn't do.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.002
What, like not having an affair?

08:22.586 --> 08:26.256
If you're happy to spend a bit more,
we do have some 18 karat.

08:27.799 --> 08:31.595
Wow, they're lovely, aren't they? Yeah.
Lovely sort of weight to 'em, you know.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.889
Okay-- No. That's too much.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.558
Yeah. No, you're right.
Don't even get her a ring.

08:36.642 --> 08:40.562
Just get her a book token
and some bubble bath. She's worth it.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.941
Yeah, she is. She's worth it.
So, would I--

08:43.941 --> 08:45.984
would I be able to
pay this in installments?

08:46.068 --> 08:48.529
If I can make most of it now...
-Sorry.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.948
...and then I pay the rest next month--
-I'm afraid not.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.242
Okay. All right.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.327
Those are the ones, though.
-I haven't got enough, have I?

08:55.327 --> 08:57.204
I'll stand you the difference.
-What? No.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.040
I've got to pay for them. That's what
three weeks of surge pricing is all about,

09:00.040 --> 09:03.001
to be able to afford four-fifths
of these rings. I mean--

09:03.085 --> 09:06.964
You are buying them yourself.
You're gonna pay me back. Come on.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.551
I can lend my best and only friend
a few hundred quid for a month.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.637
No, I can't do that. I can't do it. No.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.683
Jason...

09:20.060 --> 09:21.270
Say yes.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.440
No. No, mate.
-Hey...

09:27.818 --> 09:28.944
Say yes.

09:31.947 --> 09:32.948
Yes.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.425
Have you got everything?
-Hello.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.093
Pretty much. Did you invite everyone?

09:53.177 --> 09:54.887
Oh, yeah.
I sent a group text out, so...

09:54.887 --> 09:56.722
It took Karen eight months to do hers.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.599
We've done this in a morning.
And I stopped for coffee.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.267
We should organize
the next Olympics, babe.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.229
I mean, I've got more writing
on my hand than most brides.

10:04.313 --> 10:07.733
What about this one here?
-Music. Yeah. No, but that's okay.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.985
I mean, we were never gonna
get music in a morning, were we?

10:09.985 --> 10:11.236
No--

10:12.654 --> 10:14.990
<i>Yeah, sometimes</i>

10:14.990 --> 10:19.620
<i>It's hard to lose control</i>

10:26.251 --> 10:29.338
This is crazy. My only son,
and this is how you're doing it.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.547
I'm sorry, Mom.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.467
I haven't had a minute to get ready.
I was at bridge club.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.093
Sandra, you look amazing.

10:35.177 --> 10:38.430
Yeah, well, I hate most of my friends,
so I dress up to outdo them.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.433
Come here, you two.

10:45.771 --> 10:50.192
Welcome. Cheerio? Haribo? Regular. Tangy.

10:51.527 --> 10:52.611
I'll have a tangy.

10:52.611 --> 10:53.695
Good choice.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.490
Hi. Hiya
-Hello, Jen.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.951
Yeah, we can do it.
-Nikki.

10:58.951 --> 11:01.411
Oh, my God! Jen!

11:03.789 --> 11:06.041
I'm sorry. I'm quite sweaty.
I came straight from yoga.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.460
But I can sit on my towel.
-Stop it.

11:09.545 --> 11:10.963
I brought Tinkle. Is that okay?

11:10.963 --> 11:12.756
Yeah, that's fine.
-And her boyfriend.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.299
Hey.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.260
He's so nice. We all really get on.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.095
Jen, I just-- I didn't think
you were gonna come

11:18.095 --> 11:20.013
considering I did fire you five days ago.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.391
Yeah, I'd totally forgotten that.

11:22.975 --> 11:25.227
No, it's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.312
Tinkle and me have gone
into business together.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.439
It's called Jinkle.
-Oh, God, that's so cute.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.316
What's your business?
-It's an on-site delivery service

11:31.400 --> 11:33.151
for construction materials
and roofing supplies.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.697
Okay! That's great!

11:39.533 --> 11:40.659
God, I'm so nervous.

11:40.659 --> 11:41.994
Don't be.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.080
I mean, it's definitely challenging
given the lack of inventory data,

11:45.080 --> 11:47.207
but we're outsourcing recruitment
and scaling up slowly

11:47.291 --> 11:48.750
depending on funding streams.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.420
Right. Okay. Well, that is reassuring.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.215
Bloody hell, where have you been?
We're on in ten minutes.

11:57.801 --> 12:02.890
What? Well, you let them choose
the outfits. Here's yours.

12:10.689 --> 12:13.734
We should never have let them read
those old books that Mum gave us.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.152
She crossed out all the racism bits

12:15.152 --> 12:17.863
but then left in
all the bloody sexism bits.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.157
It's all right.
We're just on the right side of quirky.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.492
Just.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.079
Thank you. What time is it?

12:26.496 --> 12:28.457
1:30. We need to get a wiggle on.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.469
Come on, you. Let's do this.

12:53.774 --> 12:57.528
Paul was really into owls.
Unfortunately, Emily wasn't.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.572
Hence the cancellation.

13:01.698 --> 13:02.699
Shall we?

13:02.783 --> 13:03.825
Yeah.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.167
Hello.
-Hello.

13:12.251 --> 13:14.378
Well, this is a bold choice, isn't it?
-Isn't it?

13:14.378 --> 13:15.462
Yeah.

13:19.675 --> 13:21.927
She misunderstood flower girl we think.
-Right.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.763
And we're not quite sure
what the giraffe's about, but...

13:25.472 --> 13:26.557
Hey, Dad! Come on!

13:26.557 --> 13:28.225
Right?
-Yeah.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.020
Lovely.
-Thank you.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.357
You okay?
-I'm good.

13:59.464 --> 14:00.465
These are for you.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.346
I think we might have
just tipped into quirky.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.518
I'm sorry.
-No.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.981
No, this is exactly
how I'd always imagined it.

14:19.276 --> 14:23.030
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're here today to marry...

14:23.030 --> 14:25.741
Except quickly.
-...to quickly marry Emily and Paul.

14:25.741 --> 14:26.909
Nikki and Jason.
-Sorry.

14:26.909 --> 14:31.830
Nikki and Jason.
Before their friends and family.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.334
I believe you have some words
you'd like to say to each other.

14:35.334 --> 14:36.585
Yes.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.879
I do, actually. Yeah.
-Yeah, you go.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.507
Nikki.

14:42.341 --> 14:44.968
From the moment that we met...
-Yeah.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.137
...I knew I would always love your...
-Right.

14:47.221 --> 14:48.597
Okay, smile...
-Yep.

14:48.597 --> 14:51.683
...your energy, your boundless joy,
kindness, bravery,

14:51.767 --> 14:53.519
empathy, understanding, sense of humor.

14:53.519 --> 14:54.937
Goodness me.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.188
Nikki, do you have words--

14:56.188 --> 15:01.610
Dependable, romantic, decent, fun.
The way you look when you laugh.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.112
Face.

15:05.864 --> 15:06.865
Okay.
-It's fine.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.159
We know how we feel about each other.
-Yeah.

15:11.537 --> 15:15.332
Jason, will you take Nikki
to be your wedded wife,

15:16.416 --> 15:17.960
to share your life with her,

15:17.960 --> 15:22.798
to love, comfort and support her,
whatever the future may bring?

15:23.715 --> 15:24.716
I will.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.719
And Nikki, will you take--

15:27.803 --> 15:28.887
I will, yeah.

15:31.098 --> 15:35.102
It is an ancient tradition
for a bride and groom to exchange rings.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.062
We're not doing rings.

15:38.689 --> 15:40.774
Look out. Yeah.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.068
Jason!
-Well done, mate.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.197
There you are.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.491
Are you sure it fits?

15:53.620 --> 15:54.621
It fits.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.209
I don't know if that one does.
-Okay.

16:01.003 --> 16:07.801
Okay. So, if you'd like to sign
the register, you're married.

16:15.851 --> 16:20.189
No, wait. Sorry,
I want to say something proper.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.985
Oh, God.
I'm not good at saying the right thing.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.571
Whenever you talk about being happy,
you always sound like a right idiot.

16:27.571 --> 16:28.655
Don't you?

16:36.246 --> 16:41.710
But maybe being happy is not caring
whether people think you're an idiot.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.423
So I'm just going to say it.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.094
I am so in love.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.431
And I'm so happy.

17:03.023 --> 17:06.193
<i>Have I ever told you</i>

17:06.777 --> 17:10.364
<i>How good it feels to hold you</i>

17:11.365 --> 17:13.325
<i>It isn't easy to explain</i>

17:14.284 --> 17:15.285
Okay.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.040
You think we should tell them
we're not Emily and Paul?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.626
No, I want a photo with the owl.
-Okay. Careful.

17:22.626 --> 17:26.338
<i>And though I'm really trying
I think I may start crying</i>

17:26.338 --> 17:27.464
There he is.

17:28.799 --> 17:32.761
<i>My heart can't wait another day</i>

17:34.054 --> 17:38.475
<i>When you kiss me I just gotta
Kiss me I just gotta</i>

17:38.559 --> 17:44.731
<i>Kiss me I just gotta say
Baby, I love you</i>

17:45.941 --> 17:49.194
<i>Baby, I love you</i>

17:50.404 --> 17:55.117
<i>Baby, I love, I love holding you</i>

17:56.451 --> 17:57.536
Give her a kiss.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.706
All right, get a room.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.504
Congratulations. Fantastic.
-Thank you.

18:07.588 --> 18:10.507
FYI, I think I might have
made you a bit of money.

18:10.591 --> 18:11.717
Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

18:11.717 --> 18:13.468
Just shorted something.

18:14.219 --> 18:17.890
Just a small publishing firm.
But honestly, never felt so alive.

18:18.724 --> 18:21.268
Lovely. Starving.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.896
Is that for the wedding?
-No, that's a burger van.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.566
Come on then, you.

18:27.566 --> 18:31.486
Hey, kids. We're so pleased
that you could be there to see that.

18:31.570 --> 18:34.031
You're gonna go with John and Jilly
for a little while, okay?

18:34.031 --> 18:37.201
And we're gonna go see the judge. Okay?

18:37.201 --> 18:42.289
We just want you to know
that whatever happens, we love you.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.001
We love you so much.
-So much.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.504
So much. Come on!
-Come on.

18:52.216 --> 18:55.677
Guys. Hi. Is this a good time?

18:55.761 --> 18:58.180
Because I forgot to give you
your wedding present.

18:59.097 --> 19:02.643
So, I'll just leave it down here.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.895
Okay, come on. Let's go.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.022
Mum, can you take these and the muffins?
-Okay, sure.

19:07.773 --> 19:09.149
Nikki. Come on, babe.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.275
Yes. Sorry.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.697
What are you doing?
-We're coming with you.

19:23.121 --> 19:26.708
Here you go, mate.
And what can I get you, mate?

19:26.792 --> 19:28.210
Do you have any salmon terrine?

19:29.294 --> 19:31.588
I'm afraid we've just sold the last one,
mate.

19:32.798 --> 19:33.799
Arancini balls?

19:33.799 --> 19:36.552
Scott, what are you doing? Come on!

19:54.736 --> 19:55.904
We okay for time?

19:55.988 --> 19:57.197
You've got this.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.039
I can't see her.

20:08.709 --> 20:09.877
I don't think she's here.

20:09.877 --> 20:11.461
Maybe she hasn't--

20:12.462 --> 20:15.716
Okay. Well, maybe she's changed her mind.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.553
No, I don't get that vibe.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.805
Hello.
-Hello.

20:25.809 --> 20:29.313
I don't get it. Why does she hate us?
-Well, we're about to find out.

20:33.525 --> 20:34.943
This is it.

20:35.027 --> 20:37.779
Yeah. Yeah, this is it.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.075
Come on.
-Okay.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.666
Okay, who do we have?

20:50.667 --> 20:51.877
Jason Ross.

20:51.877 --> 20:53.629
Yes, thank you, Your Honor.

20:54.838 --> 20:58.675
I have been trying to figure out
for a while

20:58.759 --> 21:02.054
how I can best express
what these kids mean to us.

21:02.054 --> 21:06.183
And how much they've changed us.

21:07.226 --> 21:09.853
And all I can think to say is,
is that when I was a kid,

21:09.937 --> 21:13.649
my dad used to wear pleated trousers
and a button-down shirt on the beach.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.985
And now, he's stood out there,
and he's dressed as a wizard with a wand

21:17.069 --> 21:20.322
that I know, for a fact,
he went back and bought separately.

21:21.073 --> 21:22.908
They've done that in 12 weeks.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.661
Now, we got married today

21:26.537 --> 21:29.456
because we couldn't imagine
doing it without them.

21:31.959 --> 21:35.963
And to be honest, we don't want
to do anything without them anymore.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.468
And that's all I wanted to say.

21:44.429 --> 21:48.976
Right. Thank you for that.
I was just confirming names, though.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.019
Oh, right.

21:51.103 --> 21:53.230
So, Jason Ross?

21:53.230 --> 21:55.983
Yes, Your Honor.
That was me talking, obviously. Thank you.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.735
Nikki Newman?
-Yes.

21:58.819 --> 22:00.529
And a Mrs. Beverly Reid.

22:00.529 --> 22:01.864
Yes.

22:01.864 --> 22:05.868
Okay. So, we are here for Princess
and Tyler. Thank you all for coming.

22:05.868 --> 22:09.788
I believe there's a family statement
by Mrs. Reid. Is that correct?

22:09.872 --> 22:11.748
Yeah.
-Mrs. Reid.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.261
Bloody hell, she's brought dividers.

22:31.435 --> 22:34.897
They have no flat, they have no money,
and they have a gambling problem.

22:34.897 --> 22:37.816
Sorry, that money was invested.
It wasn't gambled.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.527
It's an addiction, like his drinking.

22:40.611 --> 22:42.571
He doesn't have a drinking problem.

22:42.571 --> 22:45.199
If anything,
he's the one that's always telling me to--

22:47.201 --> 22:49.369
He doesn't have a drinking problem.

22:49.453 --> 22:52.206
They don't dress Princess warmly enough.
Her coat's always undone.

22:52.206 --> 22:54.583
Objection, Your Honor.
Her jumper's very thick.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.001
Tyler never wears his mittens.

22:56.001 --> 22:57.920
Sorry, no,
he won't wear his mittens outside

22:57.920 --> 22:59.630
because he doesn't want them to get cold.

22:59.630 --> 23:04.510
He drives erratically. Like an Italian.
Might be the drinking.

23:04.510 --> 23:06.720
Okay. Sorry--
-Sit down.

23:06.720 --> 23:10.057
This is not a rap battle.
-But we're nice people.

23:10.057 --> 23:12.434
They're too nice!
They're not tough enough.

23:12.518 --> 23:16.021
We are tough! I've got a tattoo.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.273
Yes?

23:19.107 --> 23:21.693
Sorry, I stood up there without knowing
what I was going to say.

23:22.778 --> 23:24.780
Well, this is going tremendously well.

23:24.780 --> 23:27.824
I don't want them to have them.
-Why not?

23:29.993 --> 23:34.373
I've already lost my daughter.
I won't lose them too.

23:39.044 --> 23:41.171
Is that what you think that we want?

23:53.392 --> 23:57.688
I think we should take a little break
and go back to our corners.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.994
She doesn't hate us.

24:14.872 --> 24:16.081
She just loves them.

24:20.085 --> 24:22.921
Hey! There you go.

24:26.466 --> 24:28.093
I'm headed to the toilet, babe, all right?

24:46.987 --> 24:49.114
Now. Children!

24:50.908 --> 24:53.410
I know what it's like
to nearly lose these kids.

24:54.995 --> 24:57.456
No one's losing anyone anymore.

24:59.416 --> 25:01.793
They'll never be all ours.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.005
We'd want you there.

25:05.589 --> 25:08.717
Tyler! What did I tell you?
What did I tell you, Tyler?

25:08.717 --> 25:11.678
I mean, you'd still only be
the second scariest grandmother.

25:14.848 --> 25:15.891
It! You're it.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.228
I have to think about
what my daughter would want for them.

25:23.357 --> 25:25.275
And I don't know. I don't--

25:30.572 --> 25:32.991
Nik, we should go back in there, babe.
-Yeah.

25:41.208 --> 25:48.048
I think you should go back in there,
and you say whatever you want.

25:51.885 --> 25:55.848
'Cause you're their grandmother,
and you can do what you like.

26:02.563 --> 26:03.564
Now.

26:05.315 --> 26:08.652
What did I tell you? Be quiet.

26:10.112 --> 26:13.407
Okay. I trust we've all taken a breath.

26:15.409 --> 26:17.452
Mrs. Reid says she'd like to continue.

26:18.161 --> 26:19.162
Yeah.

26:35.220 --> 26:38.974
I think maybe she would want this.

26:39.850 --> 26:40.851
My daughter.

26:43.520 --> 26:47.024
I think that's why
she called her Princess.

26:48.317 --> 26:50.652
Because princesses get rescued.

26:58.619 --> 26:59.995
Just look after them.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.124
We should put our arms down.

27:46.208 --> 27:48.335
It looks like
we've had our convictions quashed.

27:48.335 --> 27:49.419
Come on then!

27:51.380 --> 27:52.923
Yay!

27:53.131 --> 27:54.132
You.

27:54.800 --> 27:55.843
Giraffes are heavy!

27:58.512 --> 27:59.680
Look at you!

28:03.600 --> 28:06.019
It was really touch and go
for a while there. Yeah.

28:06.603 --> 28:07.604
Bev.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.441
Come meet everyone.
-I can't do that, darling.

28:11.525 --> 28:13.402
No, we really want you to.
-No.

28:17.865 --> 28:19.783
All right. Yeah, all right.

28:22.286 --> 28:23.453
Great.

28:23.537 --> 28:24.746
Thank you.

28:24.830 --> 28:27.249
Everyone, this is Bev.

28:27.249 --> 28:28.876
Hello, Bev!
-Hi, Bev.

28:28.876 --> 28:31.670
Bev, this is everyone.
-Hello, everyone.

28:56.028 --> 28:57.029
So, this is it.

28:58.488 --> 29:00.240
The end of the beginning.
-Yeah.

29:01.283 --> 29:05.037
I think
that this is what everything looks like.

29:08.081 --> 29:10.375
I'm sad not to do it all in this place.

29:12.169 --> 29:14.421
Where we gonna go?
-I don't know.

29:14.505 --> 29:18.884
I don't know, but I will be with you
every step of the way. Okay?

29:22.804 --> 29:25.098
Gotta start packing things up into boxes.

29:25.182 --> 29:26.099
Okay.

29:26.183 --> 29:29.269
Best of luck with it. I'll see you later.
-Fun. You're very fun.

29:31.897 --> 29:36.109
Jase. This is why you lose your keys.
-They're not my keys.

29:36.193 --> 29:38.195
Mine are in my pocket.
-They're not my keys.

29:38.195 --> 29:41.532
Did you get some cut? No?
-No. Just check.

29:49.122 --> 29:50.123
They work.

29:50.207 --> 29:51.208
Weird.

29:51.208 --> 29:53.418
We can talk about rent
when you've got a moment.

29:54.920 --> 29:58.131
I had some money from the house sale,
and I need a revenue stream.

29:58.632 --> 30:01.426
I mean, I will need you out
by the time Lauren turns 21.

30:01.927 --> 30:02.970
Freddy.

30:02.970 --> 30:04.638
Look, I have this habit

30:04.638 --> 30:07.808
of only realizing
how much I love people after they leave.

30:08.851 --> 30:12.521
So, I think the best thing is if you two
just stay right where you are.

30:14.731 --> 30:15.941
Bloody hell, mate.

30:15.941 --> 30:18.986
See? Not an arsehole.

30:21.446 --> 30:23.574
Rental rates have stayed stagnant
for a while,

30:23.574 --> 30:25.617
so you may see an above-inflation rise.

30:30.831 --> 30:31.957
All right, this is getting weird.

30:31.957 --> 30:34.293
Rent's due first of every month, yeah?

30:36.003 --> 30:37.171
I mean...

31:58.168 --> 31:59.169
Mum!

32:02.881 --> 32:04.216
Mum!
-Mum!

32:07.594 --> 32:08.595
Oh, God.

32:09.638 --> 32:11.014
That's me.

32:11.098 --> 32:12.474
Yep.

32:14.726 --> 32:17.396
Okay, kids. I'm coming.
