WEBVTT

01:49.359 --> 01:52.862
l thought weapons were forbidden
on this planet.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.329
Besides,

02:03.457 --> 02:05.666
l can't believe you'd kill me

02:06.460 --> 02:08.544
for a field of empty holes.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.548
All I have.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.825
Your pain runs deep.

02:39.868 --> 02:44.205
-What do you know of my pain?
-Let us explore it together.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.125
Each man hides a secret pain.

02:48.961 --> 02:52.171
lt must be exposed and reckoned with.

02:53.423 --> 02:57.385
lt must be dragged from the darkness
and forced into the light.

02:57.928 --> 03:01.889
Share your pain.
Share your pain with me.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.226
And gain strength from the sharing.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.290
Where did you get this power?

03:31.795 --> 03:33.796
The power was within you.

03:37.050 --> 03:41.721
l feel as if a weight has been lifted
from my heart.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.350
How can I repay you for this miracle?

03:46.768 --> 03:49.562
-Join my quest.
-What is it you seek?

03:51.773 --> 03:53.316
What you seek.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.989
What all men have sought
since time began.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.660
The ultimate knowledge.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.582
To find it, we'll need a starship.

04:09.666 --> 04:13.544
A starship?
There are no starships on Nimbus lll.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.755
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.798
But how?

04:22.471 --> 04:26.807
Have faith, my friend.
There are more of us than you know.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.518
You're a Vulcan.

09:00.081 --> 09:04.001
"You'll have a great time, Bones.
You'll enjoy your shore leave.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.086
"You'll be able to relax."

09:07.589 --> 09:10.716
You call this relaxing?
l'm a nervous wreck.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.721
lf l'm not careful, I'll end up talking
to myself.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.072
Greetings, Captain.

09:34.032 --> 09:37.993
Spock! What are you doing
in this neck of the woods?

09:38.370 --> 09:41.830
-l have been monitoring your progress.
-l'm flattered.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.584
Twelve hundred points of interest
in Yosemite and you pick me.

09:45.669 --> 09:49.213
l regret to inform you that the record
for free-climbing El Capitan

09:49.297 --> 09:51.590
is in no danger of being broken.

09:51.675 --> 09:55.552
l'm not trying to break any records.
l'm doing this 'cause I enjoy it.

09:55.637 --> 09:59.265
Not to mention the most important
reason for climbing a mountain.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.683
And that is?

10:01.643 --> 10:02.851
Because it's there.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.353
Captain?

10:04.854 --> 10:08.399
l do not think you realise the gravity
of your situation.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.739
On the contrary.
Gravity is foremost on my mind.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.534
Look, l'm trying to make an ascent here.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.703
Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy
for a while?

10:21.288 --> 10:26.000
l believe that Dr McCoy
is not in the best of moods.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.378
Goddamn irresponsible. . .

10:31.965 --> 10:33.966
Playing games with life.

10:34.509 --> 10:38.178
Concentration is vital.
You must be one with the rock.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.806
Spock, I appreciate your concern,
but if you don't stop distracting me,

10:40.890 --> 10:42.224
l'm liable to be one to

10:42.726 --> 10:44.935
fall !

10:49.733 --> 10:50.733
Oh, my God.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.959
Perhaps "because it is there"

11:09.044 --> 11:10.961
is not sufficient reason
for climbing the mountain.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.630
l'm hardly in a position to disagree.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.719
Hi, Bones. Mind if we drop in for dinner?

12:10.647 --> 12:13.857
Your dream can become a reaIity.
The Paradise Inn.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.402
We have spared no expense
to create the cIosest thing to paradise

12:16.486 --> 12:18.654
in paradise... City, that is.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.036
Gentlemen, l'm Caithlin Dar.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.538
Oh, yeah.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.834
Our new Romulan representative.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.920
Welcome to Paradise City, my dear,

12:35.004 --> 12:38.298
capital of the so-called
planet of galactic peace.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.718
l'm St John Talbot,
the Federation representative

12:41.803 --> 12:43.512
here on Nimbus lll.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.850
My charming companion here is
the Klingon consul, Korrd.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.314
l expect that's Klingon for "Hello."

12:54.816 --> 12:56.567
Won't you come in, my dear?

13:13.543 --> 13:16.378
Twenty years ago,
our three governments agreed

13:16.463 --> 13:18.797
to develop this planet together.

13:20.467 --> 13:24.344
-A new age was born.
-Our new age died a quick death.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.097
And the settlers we conned
into coming here,

13:27.182 --> 13:28.932
they were the dregs of the galaxy.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.059
lmmediately took
to fighting amongst themselves.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.936
We forbad them weapons,

13:33.021 --> 13:35.481
and they soon began to fashion
their own.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.650
Well, then it appears l've arrived
just in time.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.246
We have spared no expense
to create the cIosest thing to...

14:38.503 --> 14:40.295
Get away from that transmitter!

14:47.679 --> 14:49.304
Romulan.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.808
Terran.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.894
Klingon.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.772
Consider yourselves my prisoners.

14:59.232 --> 15:04.611
Prisoners? We're already prisoners
here on this worthless lump of rock.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.323
What possible value
could we be to you?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.742
Nimbus lll may be a worthless
lump of rock,

15:10.827 --> 15:12.953
but it does have one unique treasure.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.999
lt's the only place in the entire galaxy
that has the three of you.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.586
l don't know who you are,
or what you want, but I can tell you this.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.589
Our governments will stop at nothing
to ensure our safety.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.174
That's exactly what l'm counting on.

15:36.978 --> 15:40.772
U.S.S. Enterprise,
shakedown cruise report.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.942
I think this new ship was put together
by monkeys.

15:44.027 --> 15:47.904
Oh, she's got a fine engine,
but haIf the doors won't open.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.866
And guess whose job it is
to make it right?

15:52.243 --> 15:53.702
Borgus Frat.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.457
"Let's see what she's got,"
said the Captain.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.250
And then we found out, didn't we?

16:00.335 --> 16:02.878
l know you'll whip her into shape,
Scotty. You always do.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.921
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.382
And I thought we were supposed to be
going together.

16:07.634 --> 16:11.053
Oh, I cannot leave her now
when she needs me the most.

16:12.889 --> 16:16.058
l had a feeling
you would say something like that.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.560
So I brought us dinner.

16:19.646 --> 16:24.149
Oh, lassie, you're the most
understanding woman I know.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.236
Red... Red... Red aIert.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.948
-Red aIert.
-l just fixed that damn thing.

16:32.075 --> 16:35.577
-Red... Red... Red aIert.
-Turn it off, will you?

16:36.454 --> 16:42.417
Red aIert. Red aIert. This is a red aIert.
Enterprise acknowledge.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.007
This is Enterprise. ldentify yourself.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.051
Enterprise, this is Starfleet.

16:51.135 --> 16:54.513
We have a priority seven situation
in the NeutraI Zone.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.889
Stand by, Starfleet.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.101
-Scotty, this is for real.
-They can't be serious.

16:59.769 --> 17:03.480
The ship's in pieces and we've got less
than a skeleton crew aboard.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.359
Starfleet, are you aware
of our current status?

17:08.444 --> 17:10.112
Current status understood.

17:10.195 --> 17:14.031
Stand by to copy operationaI orders
and recaII key personneI.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.327
Admit it. We're lost.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.622
All right, we're lost.
But we're making good time.

17:20.832 --> 17:24.417
-Commander SuIu, come in, pIease.
-l don't believe this.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.211
Commander Sulu here.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.547
Bad news, gentlemen.
Shore leave's been cancelled.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.340
Rescued at last!

17:30.425 --> 17:33.343
Return to prearranged coordinates
for pickup.

17:34.345 --> 17:37.013
Don't tell them you're lost.
You'll never live it down.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.683
ls there a problem, gentlemen?

17:40.601 --> 17:43.562
Yes, we've been caught in a. . .

17:44.147 --> 17:46.481
We've been caught in a blizzard.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.944
And we can't see a thing.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.780
Request you direct us
to the coordinates.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.741
My visuaI says

17:56.117 --> 17:58.994
sunny skies and 70 degrees.

18:01.831 --> 18:05.208
Sulu, look. The sun's come out.
lt's a miracle.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.754
Don't worry, feIIas.
Your secret's safe with me.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.630
I'II send the shuttIecraft to pick you up.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.508
Uhura, I owe you one. Sulu out.

18:15.178 --> 18:18.013
Come and get it! Come and get it!

18:18.097 --> 18:22.267
Knock it. . . Bones! Bones,
knock it off! We're right here.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.352
And we're starving.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.771
Bipodal seeds, Doctor?

18:25.855 --> 18:29.065
Beans, Spock. But no ordinary beans.

18:29.150 --> 18:33.445
These are from an old Southern recipe
handed down to me by my father.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.740
And if you stick your Vulcan nose up
at these,

18:36.908 --> 18:41.119
you're not only insulting me,
but generations of McCoys.

18:41.245 --> 18:45.665
ln that case, I have little choice
but to sample your beans.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.926
Surprisingly good.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.886
lt does have flavouring
l'm not familiar with.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.889
That's the secret ingredient.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.184
You got any more
of that secret ingredient, Bones?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.687
-Be my guest.
-Thank you.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.191
Am I to understand
that your secret ingredient is alcohol?

19:11.818 --> 19:15.028
Whisky. Tennessee whisky, Spock.
You care for a little snort?

19:15.112 --> 19:17.322
Bourbon and beans,
an explosive combination.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.407
Think Spock can handle it?

19:19.492 --> 19:22.410
Are you kidding?
With that Vulcan metabolism,

19:22.495 --> 19:26.206
he could eat a bowl of termites
and it wouldn't bother him.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.335
As you are so fond of pointing out,
Doctor, l'm half human.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.754
Well, it certainly doesn't show.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.631
Thank you.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.675
How do you like that?
This guy never changes.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.052
l insult him, and he takes it
as a compliment.

19:43.224 --> 19:46.101
You know, you two
could drive a man to drink.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.686
Me? What did I do?

19:47.770 --> 19:49.145
What did you do?

19:49.230 --> 19:51.022
You really piss me off, Jim.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.443
Human life is far too precious
to risk on crazy stunts.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.864
Maybe it didn't cross
that macho mind of yours,

19:58.948 --> 20:01.950
but you should've been killed
when you fell off that mountain.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.036
-lt crossed my mind.
-And?

20:05.121 --> 20:07.789
And, even as I fell, I knew I wouldn't die.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.710
l thought he was the only one
who's immortal.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.879
Oh, no. lt isn't that.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.965
l knew I wouldn't die because
the two of you were with me.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.136
l do not understand.

20:22.054 --> 20:26.016
l've always known I'll die alone.

20:31.147 --> 20:35.901
Well, I'll call Valhalla
and have them reserve a room for you.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.824
lt's a mystery to me
what draws us together.

20:42.909 --> 20:47.245
All that time in space,
and we getting on each others' nerves,

20:47.330 --> 20:50.415
and what do we do when shore leave
comes along?

20:51.125 --> 20:52.918
We spend it together.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.670
Other people have families.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.423
Other people, Bones. Not us.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.474
What are you doing?

21:08.476 --> 21:11.686
l am preparing to toast a marsh melon.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.857
Well, I'll be damned. A marsh melon.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.444
Where'd you learn to do that?

21:19.528 --> 21:21.780
Before leaving the ship,
l consulted the computer library

21:21.864 --> 21:25.575
to familiarise myself with the customs
associated with camping out.

21:26.494 --> 21:28.578
Well, tell me, Spock.

21:28.663 --> 21:32.207
What do we do
after we toast the marsh melon?

21:33.876 --> 21:35.293
We consume them.

21:35.378 --> 21:38.380
l know we consume them.
l mean after that.

21:40.174 --> 21:44.678
l believe we are required to engage
in a ritual known as the sing-along.

21:45.388 --> 21:49.224
That's great. I haven't sung around
a campfire since I was a boy in lowa.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.850
What are we going to sing? What. . .

21:50.935 --> 21:52.310
Bones, what are we going to sing?

21:52.395 --> 21:54.312
How about Camptown Races?

21:54.397 --> 21:55.730
Pack Up Your TroubIes.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.065
Are we leaving, Captain?

21:57.149 --> 21:58.817
lt's a song title, Spock.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.568
Moon over RigeI VII.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.821
Row, Row, Row Your Boat.

22:02.905 --> 22:04.698
Row, Row, Row Your Boat. I love Row...

22:04.782 --> 22:06.950
Do you know Row, Row, Row,
Row, Row Your Boat?

22:07.034 --> 22:09.160
That song did not come up
in my research, Captain.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.746
The lyrics are very simple. lt's,

22:12.331 --> 22:15.166
"Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

22:15.334 --> 22:19.421
"Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream"

22:20.339 --> 22:21.840
The Doctor and I will start it off,

22:21.924 --> 22:24.551
and then when we give you a signal,
you jump in.

22:24.635 --> 22:26.511
Doctor, if you please.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.141
Don't say I didn't warn you.

22:32.101 --> 22:37.147
Row, row, row your boat
GentIy down the stream

22:37.231 --> 22:39.691
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-Row, row, row your boat

22:39.775 --> 22:42.277
-Life is but a dream
-GentIy down the stream

22:42.403 --> 22:44.821
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy

22:45.239 --> 22:46.239
Life...

22:46.323 --> 22:47.323
Come on, Spock.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.034
Why didn't you jump in?

22:49.118 --> 22:52.454
l was trying to comprehend
the meaning of the words.

22:52.955 --> 22:56.041
lt's a song, you green-blooded Vulcan.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.501
You sing it. The words aren't important.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.921
What's important
is that you have a good time singing it.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.632
l am sorry, Doctor.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.135
Were we having a good time?

23:07.219 --> 23:09.054
God, I liked him better before he died.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.597
All right, all right, let's call it a night.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.515
-He just keeps after it.
-Let's. . . Let's go to bed,

23:12.600 --> 23:14.476
and just let's get some sleep.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.072
-Captain?
-Spock, we're on leave.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.364
You can call me Jim.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.283
-Jim?
-Yes, Spock?

23:30.993 --> 23:32.952
Life is not a dream.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.498
Go to sleep, Spock.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.833
Yes, Captain.

23:40.211 --> 23:43.088
-Good night, Bones.
-Good night, Jim.

23:44.256 --> 23:48.218
-Good night, Spock.
-Good night, Doctor.

23:49.011 --> 23:52.388
-Good night, Spock.
-Good night, Jim.

23:55.309 --> 23:58.353
l don't know. I just don't know.

24:19.959 --> 24:23.962
Captain Klaa, we have a target in sight.
A probe of ancient origin.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.713
Difficult to hit?

24:25.840 --> 24:27.298
Most difficult.

24:27.383 --> 24:28.424
Good.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.802
All weapons to my control.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.428
Scope!

24:59.915 --> 25:04.252
Shooting space garbage
is no test of a warrior's mettle.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.755
l need a target that fights back.

25:08.424 --> 25:12.260
Captain, new data,
hostages on Nimbus lll.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.267
One of the hostages is a Klingon.

25:19.977 --> 25:21.227
And the others?

25:21.520 --> 25:24.606
A Terran and a Romulan.

25:26.066 --> 25:30.278
That means the Federation
will be sending a rescue ship of its own.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.699
Plot course for Nimbus lll.

25:36.619 --> 25:40.663
l've always wanted to engage
a Federation ship.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.755
Get that damn light out of my face!

25:59.892 --> 26:03.811
Mr Scott apologises
for having to send the shuttlecraft.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.606
The transporter beam
is non-operational.

26:06.815 --> 26:10.360
Captain, we've received important
orders from Starfleet command.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.528
Why didn't you beep my communicator?

26:12.613 --> 26:15.031
You forgot to take it with you.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.866
Wonder why I did that.

26:16.951 --> 26:20.495
Well, gentlemen, it appears
shore leave has been cancelled.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.330
Pack out your trash.

26:54.530 --> 26:59.617
"All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by"

26:59.702 --> 27:01.661
-Melville.
-John Masefield.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.123
Are you sure about that?

27:05.207 --> 27:07.875
l am well versed in the classics, Doctor.

27:08.877 --> 27:12.380
Then how come you don't know
Row, Row, Row Your Boat?

27:20.556 --> 27:24.559
Ready for Ianding manoeuvre.
Enterprise, you have control.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.228
You're doing just fine.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.667
Landing bay oxygen to pressure.

27:52.379 --> 27:57.759
Landing bay is secure.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.390
Attention !

28:04.475 --> 28:06.934
All I can say is, they don't make them
like they used to.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.687
You told me you could have this ship
operational in two weeks.

28:09.772 --> 28:11.022
l gave you three. What happened?

28:11.106 --> 28:13.066
l think you gave me
too much time, Captain.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.525
-Very well, Mr Scott. Carry on.
-Aye, sir.

28:14.610 --> 28:18.946
How many times do I have to tell you?
The right tool for the right job!

28:20.449 --> 28:22.200
l don't think l've ever seen him happier.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.451
LeveI?

28:23.869 --> 28:25.078
Bridge.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.413
l hope.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.963
l could use a shower.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.424
Yes.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.472
Doesn't anything work on this ship?

28:44.556 --> 28:47.225
Starfleet's got some nerve
sending us out in this condition

28:47.309 --> 28:49.143
with this handful of people.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.062
Captain on the Bridge.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.564
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.983
Put it on the viewscreen,
will you, please?

28:58.821 --> 29:01.197
Can we have a little quiet, please?

29:07.121 --> 29:08.579
-Can you. . .
-Am I on?

29:08.664 --> 29:10.665
Can you clear that up?

29:12.292 --> 29:13.584
Can we have a little quiet?

29:13.669 --> 29:15.962
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations.
Come in.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.839
-Bob?
-Jim!

29:19.007 --> 29:21.676
WeII! We're dressing informaIIy,
aren't we?

29:22.803 --> 29:24.595
You caught me on the way
to the shower.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.597
I apoIogise for canceIIing shore Ieave,

29:26.682 --> 29:31.352
but Iook, we have a dangerous situation
out on Nimbus III.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.273
-On the planet of galactic peace?
-The same.

29:35.524 --> 29:36.691
From what we can make out,

29:36.775 --> 29:39.986
a terrorist force
has captured the onIy settIement.

29:40.070 --> 29:43.114
And they've taken hostages.
The KIingon, the RomuIan,

29:43.198 --> 29:44.699
the Federation consuIs.

29:44.783 --> 29:48.202
Now, I know Enterprise is not exactIy
up to specs...

29:49.246 --> 29:52.331
With all due respect,
the Enterprise is a disaster.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.791
There must be other ships
in the quadrant.

29:53.876 --> 29:57.128
Other ships, yes.
But no experienced commanders.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.797
Captain, I need Jim Kirk.

29:59.882 --> 30:01.466
-Oh, please.
-Your orders are

30:01.550 --> 30:04.385
to proceed to Nimbus III,
assess the situation,

30:05.220 --> 30:07.638
and avoid a confrontation if possibIe.

30:07.723 --> 30:11.142
Above aÂ¡Â¡, however,
get those hostages back safeIy.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.394
Have the Klingons responded?

30:13.479 --> 30:14.979
No, but you can bet they wiII.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.772
Understood. Kirk out.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.150
Plot course for Nimbus lll, Mr Sulu.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.526
Aye, sir.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.279
Course plotted.

30:23.363 --> 30:26.949
l'm afraid the ship's problems
will have to be solved en route.

30:27.034 --> 30:30.369
Since we're undermanned, l'm counting
on each one of you to give his best.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.455
End of speech. Let's go to work.

30:32.539 --> 30:36.834
Jim, if you ask me, and you haven't,

30:37.169 --> 30:41.047
l think this is a terrible idea.
We're bound to bump into the Klingons,

30:41.131 --> 30:43.508
and they don't exactly like you.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.426
The feeling's mutual.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.179
-Engine Room.
-Scotty here.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.389
We'll need all the power
you can muster, mister.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.684
Don't you worry, Captain.
We'll beat those Klingon devils

30:54.019 --> 30:55.311
even if I have to get out and push.

30:55.771 --> 30:58.272
l hope it won't come to that, Mr Scott.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.149
All possible speed, Mr Sulu.

31:00.234 --> 31:01.442
Aye, sir.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.326
What's the matter, Jim?

31:10.661 --> 31:12.161
l miss my old chair.

31:20.087 --> 31:24.131
The starship Enterprise
has been dispatched to Nimbus lll.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.342
Enterprise?

31:28.220 --> 31:29.971
That's Kirk's ship!

31:34.476 --> 31:36.936
lf I could defeat Kirk. . .

31:39.022 --> 31:43.109
You would be the greatest warrior
in the galaxy.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.945
Maximum speed.

31:47.447 --> 31:48.906
Success!

31:50.325 --> 31:53.286
Captain's Log, Stardate 845. . .

31:58.000 --> 32:00.835
Captain's Log, Stardate 84. . .

32:03.839 --> 32:07.216
-Good morning, Captain.
-That's. . . Forget it.

32:07.301 --> 32:11.178
Captain, we're receiving the hostage
information you requested.

32:11.722 --> 32:13.514
Put it on the screen.

32:13.974 --> 32:18.728
This is an authorised transmission
from StarfIeet GaIactic Memory Bank.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.691
-Not General Korrd.
-The same.

32:24.318 --> 32:27.445
He's apparently fallen out of favour
with the Klingon High Command.

32:27.529 --> 32:30.114
General Korrd's military strategies
were required learning

32:30.198 --> 32:32.408
when I was a cadet at the Academy.

32:33.452 --> 32:37.455
When they put me out to pasture,
l hope I fare better than Korrd.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.251
This must be the hostage tape.

32:43.211 --> 32:46.464
A short time ago,
we wiIIingIy surrendered ourseIves

32:46.548 --> 32:49.425
to the forces
of the GaIactic Army of Light.

32:50.594 --> 32:52.970
At this moment,
we're in their protective custody.

32:53.055 --> 32:55.264
Their Ieader assures us
that we wiII be treated humaneIy

32:55.349 --> 32:58.017
so Iong as you cooperate
with his demands.

32:58.101 --> 33:02.438
I beIieve his sincerity. He requests
that you send a Federation starship

33:02.522 --> 33:04.940
to parIey for our reIease at once.

33:05.359 --> 33:07.401
Be assured that we are in good heaIth,

33:07.486 --> 33:09.987
and wouId appreciate
your immediate response.

33:13.700 --> 33:17.203
I deepIy regret this desperate act,
but these are desperate times.

33:17.287 --> 33:18.996
I have no desire
to harm these innocents,

33:19.081 --> 33:21.916
but do not put me to the test.
I impIore you...

33:22.959 --> 33:26.545
I impIore you to respond immediateIy.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.103
What is it?

33:43.438 --> 33:47.483
-You look like you've just seen a ghost.
-Perhaps I have, Captain.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.151
Perhaps I have.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.929
Spock, what is it?

34:17.973 --> 34:21.183
-Do you know this Vulcan?
-l cannot be certain.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.310
But he does seem familiar.

34:23.645 --> 34:26.563
He reminds me of someone
l knew in my youth.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.315
Why, Spock, I didn't know you had one.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.360
l do not often think of the past.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.280
Who is it he reminds you of?

34:34.364 --> 34:38.199
There was a young student,
exceptionally gifted,

34:39.244 --> 34:42.621
possessing a great intelligence.

34:44.123 --> 34:47.168
lt was assumed that one day
he would take his place

34:47.252 --> 34:49.962
amongst the great scholars of Vulcan.

34:50.464 --> 34:53.507
-But he was a revolutionary.
-What do you mean?

34:53.925 --> 34:56.051
The knowledge and experience
he sought

34:56.136 --> 34:58.763
were forbidden by Vulcan belief.

34:58.847 --> 35:03.017
-Forbidden?
-He rejected his logical upbringing

35:03.894 --> 35:06.979
and embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors.

35:07.063 --> 35:08.147
Why?

35:09.858 --> 35:15.112
He believed the key to self-knowledge
was emotion, not logic.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.657
lmagine that. A passionate Vulcan.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.660
When he encouraged others
to follow him,

35:21.745 --> 35:24.705
he was banished from Vulcan,
never to return.

35:26.208 --> 35:29.001
-Fascinating.
-Captain to the Bridge.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.295
On my way.

35:37.093 --> 35:39.386
-Spock?
-Coming, Captain.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.394
Approaching Nimbus lll.

35:47.521 --> 35:49.563
Hailing frequency open.

35:49.773 --> 35:51.023
Standard orbit, Mr Sulu.

35:53.735 --> 35:56.946
Captain, we're receiving transmission
from Paradise City.

35:57.030 --> 35:59.323
They're demanding to know
our intentions.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.784
Respond with static.
Let them think we're having difficulty.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.285
Which wouldn't be far from the truth.

36:03.954 --> 36:06.622
Paradise City,
can you boost your power?

36:06.706 --> 36:08.749
We're barely receiving transmission.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.543
Transporter Room. Status.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.378
Scotty here, Captain.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.381
Transporter is still inoperative.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.716
Even if we could lock on
to the hostages,

36:17.801 --> 36:20.052
we could not beam them up.

36:23.557 --> 36:25.516
We're gonna have to get them out
the old-fashioned way.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.351
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant.

36:27.435 --> 36:31.063
Bird-of-prey. Estimating 1.9 hours
until her weapons come to bear.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.275
Damn. Let's go.

36:54.504 --> 36:57.548
Their scanning equipment is primitive
but effective.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.342
l recommend we land
at coordinates 8-5-6-3.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.720
That puts us pretty far away
from Paradise City.

37:02.804 --> 37:05.306
To land any closer
would be to risk detection.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.850
-Mr Sulu. Execute.
-Aye, sir.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.067
Paradise City.
This is Starship Enterprise.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.194
A Federation starship.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.743
This is Captain PaveI Chekov speaking.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.996
You are in vioIation
of NeutraI Zone Treaty.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.582
I advise you
to reIease your hostages at once,

37:31.666 --> 37:32.833
or suffer the consequences.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.668
Your threats amuse me,
Captain Chekov.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.503
What consequences
did you have in mind?

37:57.692 --> 37:59.234
Go! Go! Go!

38:00.278 --> 38:02.863
Even as we speak,
a Klingon warship is on its way.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.990
We estimate arrival within the hour.

38:05.367 --> 38:07.451
l imagine the Klingons
will be quite angry.

38:07.535 --> 38:10.871
You are a master of understatement.
They are IikeIy to destroy the pIanet.

38:10.956 --> 38:15.125
Then it's fortunate that I have you
and your starship to protect me.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.671
ln the meantime, Captain Chekov,
l instruct you and your first officer

38:18.755 --> 38:21.048
to beam down to my coordinates.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.551
We wiII be happy to beam down.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.429
But first we must have
certain assurances.

38:30.934 --> 38:34.520
At foot speed, I estimate the journey
to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.563
We don't have 1.2 hours.

38:38.400 --> 38:41.110
Wait a minute. Perfect!

38:41.403 --> 38:43.862
But we'll have to get their attention.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.623
What?

39:00.380 --> 39:01.880
What's that?

39:03.383 --> 39:04.466
Damn !

39:05.385 --> 39:06.802
ls she naked?

39:08.513 --> 39:10.055
-What?
-ls she naked?

39:13.935 --> 39:15.728
What is that?

39:50.555 --> 39:52.264
Hello, boys.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.603
l've always wanted to play
to a captive audience.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.314
Oh, damn.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.945
-Spock.
-Yes, Captain?

40:07.655 --> 40:09.990
-Be one with the horse.
-Yes, Captain.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.581
Open the gate. lt's our lookout party.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.670
Federation soldiers right behind us.
Close the gate!

40:33.264 --> 40:35.015
Where are they going?

40:35.517 --> 40:38.560
-Spock.
-Hold your horse, Captain. l'm scanning.

40:44.359 --> 40:49.029
The hostages are being held
in that structure.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.575
Galileo, this is Strike Team.
Start your run.

40:56.496 --> 40:59.623
-Who are you?
-Phasers on stun. Get rid of the mounts.

40:59.707 --> 41:01.792
-Sulu, take out that light.
-Yes, Captain.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.057
What's going on?

41:17.142 --> 41:18.767
I instruct you to surrender at once.

41:18.852 --> 41:21.353
You are under attack
by superior Federation forces.

41:21.437 --> 41:24.523
Do you realise what you've done?
lt wasn't bloodshed I wanted !

41:24.607 --> 41:25.732
Wait! Come back!

42:11.613 --> 42:13.197
Uhura, come on down.

42:13.740 --> 42:14.948
Roger. Coming in.

42:59.869 --> 43:03.247
RecreationaI opportunities are IimitIess.
The vicinity is famous for its pIentifuI

43:03.331 --> 43:06.500
IocaI wiIdIife. And the fishing? Terrific.

43:07.043 --> 43:08.919
Easy financing
through Federation FederaI

43:09.003 --> 43:11.421
can put you in your own home...

43:11.506 --> 43:12.839
Thank God.

43:13.633 --> 43:15.342
Please cooperate.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.594
Would you mind handing over
your weapons?

43:17.679 --> 43:20.514
So, what are you waiting for?
Beam on down!

43:21.516 --> 43:24.017
Well done, my friends.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.561
Spock!

44:17.155 --> 44:18.363
Spock.

44:19.032 --> 44:21.783
lt's me. lt's Sybok.

44:22.910 --> 44:25.704
After all these years,
you've finally caught up with me.

44:28.499 --> 44:30.584
Don't you have anything to say to me?

44:34.297 --> 44:37.049
You are under arrest

44:37.133 --> 44:40.177
for seventeen violations
of the Neutral Zone Treaty.

44:51.356 --> 44:54.691
Spock, you've developed
a sense of humour after all.

44:54.776 --> 44:59.946
lt was not my intention to amuse you.
These are serious charges.

45:01.532 --> 45:05.827
-However, if you surrender now. . .
-l'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now.

45:05.912 --> 45:08.789
l'm not through violating
Neutral Zone Treaty.

45:11.459 --> 45:13.794
ln fact, l'm just getting started.

45:13.878 --> 45:18.757
And for my next violation,
l intend to steal something.

45:20.051 --> 45:21.635
Something very big.

45:25.973 --> 45:27.808
l must have your starship.

45:28.226 --> 45:31.895
You staged all this
to get your hands on my ship?

45:32.647 --> 45:35.482
-Who are you?
-James T. Kirk,

45:35.858 --> 45:39.611
-Captain of the Enterprise.
-But I thought Captain Chekov. . .

45:40.571 --> 45:41.947
l see!

45:42.824 --> 45:44.741
Very clever, Captain.

45:46.077 --> 45:50.038
Spock, it would appear that you've been
given a second chance to join me.

45:50.456 --> 45:52.082
What do you say?

45:53.084 --> 45:57.003
-l am a Starfleet officer.
-Of course.

45:58.923 --> 46:00.298
Of course.

46:01.509 --> 46:04.136
Then I'll take the ship without your help.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.241
Shuttle en route.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.160
Position, bird-of-prey?

46:31.622 --> 46:32.873
Closing.

46:39.213 --> 46:43.049
Estimating attack range
in 8,000 kellicams.

46:43.134 --> 46:48.221
Stealth approach,
slow to one quarter impulse power.

46:48.431 --> 46:50.182
Prepare to cloak.

46:51.225 --> 46:53.226
Engage cloaking device.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.695
Mr Chekov.

47:04.906 --> 47:07.282
l've lost the bird-of-prey.
She must have cloaked.

47:07.366 --> 47:09.451
-Raise shields.
-But the shuttle. . .

47:09.744 --> 47:11.620
Do it. Go to red alert.

47:23.966 --> 47:27.844
Once we've taken control of your vessel,
we'll bring up the rest of our followers.

47:27.929 --> 47:29.846
The Klingons are out there.

47:29.931 --> 47:31.890
We'll be lucky to get back
to the ship ourselves.

47:31.974 --> 47:34.768
Galileo, this is Enterprise.
Condition red aIert.

47:34.852 --> 47:38.855
Bird-of-prey approaching.
She is cIoaked. Raising shieIds.

47:38.940 --> 47:41.816
Recommend Galileo find safe harbour
until situation secure.

47:42.443 --> 47:43.985
-AcknowIedge.
-No!

47:47.114 --> 47:49.950
No reply. Remain on course.

47:50.952 --> 47:55.455
Sybok, listen to me. ln order
for this craft to enter the landing bay,

47:55.540 --> 47:59.626
Enterprise must lower the shields
and activate the tractor beam.

48:00.419 --> 48:03.964
To get us inside
and re-raise the shields will take. . .

48:04.048 --> 48:05.715
Exactly 15.5 seconds.

48:05.800 --> 48:09.302
An eternity, during which we'll be
vulnerable to Klingon attack.

48:09.387 --> 48:11.721
-Korrd, you tell him.
-He speaks the truth.

48:11.806 --> 48:15.642
lf my people are cloaked,
then they intend to strike.

48:17.853 --> 48:19.521
We cannot turn back.

48:19.939 --> 48:23.024
-You must allow us to act.
-Let me do something.

48:23.859 --> 48:27.445
Very well. Do what you must.
But no more.

48:35.204 --> 48:37.497
Enterprise. This is Kirk.

48:38.082 --> 48:39.332
Kirk.

48:39.417 --> 48:41.418
He's on the shuttlecraft!

48:41.794 --> 48:43.545
Alter the attack course!

48:43.629 --> 48:47.674
Understand your situation.
Are unable to return to planet.

48:49.093 --> 48:54.598
Stand by to execute
Emergency Landing Plan B.

48:58.561 --> 49:02.606
-What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
-l don't have a clue.

49:02.690 --> 49:06.234
-B, as in "barricade."
-He can't be serious.

49:10.531 --> 49:12.365
What are you doing?

49:13.576 --> 49:16.411
ln order to lower and raise the shields
as quickly as possible,

49:16.495 --> 49:20.206
we're going to forego the tractor beam
and fly her in manually.

49:20.708 --> 49:23.084
-Manually?
-How often have you done this?

49:24.253 --> 49:26.588
Actually, it's my first attempt.

49:30.343 --> 49:31.635
He's good.

49:32.720 --> 49:33.928
Really.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.352
Scotty, on my mark, open bay doors.

49:49.195 --> 49:51.488
Stand by to de-cloak for firing.

49:51.572 --> 49:53.907
Kirk to Scotty. Lower shields.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.742
Lowering shields, sir.

50:04.210 --> 50:08.004
Bird-of-prey bearing 1 -0-5 mark 2.

50:08.089 --> 50:09.422
Go, Sulu !

50:27.066 --> 50:28.066
They're in !

50:29.110 --> 50:30.860
Bear on Enterprise.

50:31.028 --> 50:33.363
Enterprise targeted !

50:33.447 --> 50:35.365
Warp speed now.

50:35.658 --> 50:36.825
Firing !

50:43.582 --> 50:45.625
Track her course!

50:48.295 --> 50:49.629
He's good.

51:31.380 --> 51:33.673
We must change course at once.

51:39.638 --> 51:41.848
l'll take you to the Bridge.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.220
Pick it up.

52:27.228 --> 52:28.353
Sybok.

52:31.357 --> 52:33.066
You must surrender.

52:37.404 --> 52:38.404
No.

52:41.408 --> 52:44.869
-You must kill me.
-Shoot him !

52:56.799 --> 53:01.094
For a moment,
l thought you might actually do it.

53:07.434 --> 53:10.019
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.

53:14.859 --> 53:15.942
Spock.

53:18.028 --> 53:21.072
You will accompany me to the Bridge?

53:21.991 --> 53:23.116
No.

53:25.286 --> 53:26.786
l will not.

53:29.164 --> 53:31.332
You know l'm right.

53:37.590 --> 53:39.507
Then you must join them.

53:58.068 --> 53:59.694
Move. Move!

54:00.487 --> 54:04.699
-These two will be useful.
-Give us a moment alone.

54:05.951 --> 54:07.452
Don't be afraid.

54:25.679 --> 54:28.473
-Damn it, Spock. God damn it!
-Captain, what I have done. . .

54:28.557 --> 54:30.266
What you have done
is betray every man on this ship.

54:30.351 --> 54:33.603
Worse. I have betrayed you.
l do not expect you to forgive me.

54:33.687 --> 54:35.939
Forgive you? I ought to knock you
on your goddamn ass.

54:36.023 --> 54:37.440
lf you think it would help.

54:37.524 --> 54:40.151
-You want me to hold him, Jim?
-You stay out of this.

54:40.527 --> 54:44.030
Why, Spock? Why?
All you had to do was pull the trigger.

54:44.114 --> 54:46.449
lf I had pulled the trigger,
Sybok would be dead.

54:46.533 --> 54:50.078
-l ordered you to defend your ship.
-You ordered me to kill my brother.

54:50.162 --> 54:52.038
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan,
but that doesn't. . .

54:52.122 --> 54:54.165
No, no, no, Captain.
You do not understand.

54:54.249 --> 54:57.418
Sybok also is a son of Sarek.

54:57.503 --> 55:00.129
You mean he's your "brother" brother?

55:01.090 --> 55:03.299
-You made that up.
-l did not.

55:03.384 --> 55:05.301
You did, too.
Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother

55:05.386 --> 55:07.637
because I happen to know for a fact
you don't have a brother.

55:07.721 --> 55:10.556
Technically you are correct.
l do not have a brother.

55:10.641 --> 55:13.476
-There, you see? See?
-l have a half-brother.

55:15.604 --> 55:17.230
l gotta sit down.

55:19.733 --> 55:21.109
Let me get this straight.

55:21.193 --> 55:23.945
You and Sybok have the same father
but different mothers.

55:24.029 --> 55:27.991
Exactly. That is correct.
Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess.

55:28.075 --> 55:31.411
Upon her death,
Sybok and I were raised as brothers.

55:32.371 --> 55:34.247
Why didn't you tell us this before?

55:35.040 --> 55:38.126
l was not disposed to discuss matters
of a personal nature.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.086
For that, I am sorry.

55:40.421 --> 55:42.505
He's sorry. See? He's sorry.
That makes everything all right.

55:42.589 --> 55:44.757
-He's sorry. Everything. . .
-Stop it, Jim !

55:44.842 --> 55:47.677
Spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you.

55:47.761 --> 55:49.012
lf you want to punish him
for what he's done,

55:49.096 --> 55:50.888
why don't you throw him in the brig?

55:50.973 --> 55:53.683
Besides, we've got
bigger problems to deal with.

55:53.767 --> 55:56.227
Like how the hell to get out of here.

55:56.895 --> 55:58.521
l'll say one thing, Spock.

55:58.605 --> 56:01.816
-You never cease to amaze me.
-Nor I myself.

56:09.533 --> 56:11.951
l was beginning to worry.
Where is the captain?

56:12.036 --> 56:15.413
lt's all right, Pavel.
Sybok will explain everything.

56:17.082 --> 56:20.376
-Sulu, what are you doing?
-Plotting our new course.

56:20.461 --> 56:22.754
New course? You have no authority.

56:26.300 --> 56:28.134
What's going on here?

56:28.218 --> 56:29.385
-Pavel. . .
-l won't force you.

56:29.470 --> 56:32.597
-. . .you've got to listen to this man.
-The decision must be yours.

56:32.681 --> 56:35.975
-l don't understand.
-Each of us hides a secret pain.

56:36.977 --> 56:41.481
Share yours with me
and gain strength from the sharing.

56:58.499 --> 57:00.166
Useless.

57:07.174 --> 57:08.716
Unwise.

57:17.434 --> 57:20.019
-You could've warned me.
-He did, Jim.

57:20.229 --> 57:21.771
There's got to be a way
out of this place.

57:21.855 --> 57:24.524
This is a new brig, Captain.
lt is escape-proof.

57:25.609 --> 57:28.194
-How do you know?
-The designers tested it

57:28.278 --> 57:32.365
using the most intelligent
and resourceful person they could find.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.283
He failed to escape.

57:34.368 --> 57:37.620
This person didn't by any chance
have pointed ears

57:37.704 --> 57:42.250
and an unerring capacity for getting
his shipmates into trouble, did he?

57:45.462 --> 57:47.588
He did have pointed ears.

57:52.261 --> 57:54.595
Following new course. Warp 7.

57:54.680 --> 57:58.057
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours,
present speed.

58:00.727 --> 58:02.103
Now that we're under way,

58:02.187 --> 58:05.398
it's time I announced my intentions
to the rest of the ship.

58:06.525 --> 58:09.110
Brave crew of the Starship Enterprise,

58:10.279 --> 58:12.738
consider the questions of existence.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.491
These are the questions
which man has asked

58:15.576 --> 58:19.704
ever since he first gazed at the stars
and dreamed.

58:20.205 --> 58:24.333
My VuIcan ancestors were ruIed
by their emotions.

58:24.418 --> 58:29.589
They feIt with their hearts.
They made Iove with their hearts.

58:30.465 --> 58:32.800
They beIieved with their hearts.

58:32.885 --> 58:35.678
But above all else,
they believed in a place

58:35.762 --> 58:39.473
in which these questions of existence
would be answered.

58:41.185 --> 58:43.895
Modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth,

58:44.897 --> 58:48.524
a fantasy concocted by pagans.

58:49.610 --> 58:52.111
It is no fantasy, I teII you.

58:53.739 --> 58:54.989
I teII you

58:56.617 --> 58:57.992
it exists.

58:58.368 --> 59:01.537
My brothers, we have been chosen

59:02.623 --> 59:06.792
to undertake
the greatest adventure of all time.

59:08.212 --> 59:11.422
The discovery of Sha'Ka'Ree.

59:12.966 --> 59:14.884
-ls it possible?
-ls what possible?

59:14.968 --> 59:19.388
That he's found Sha'Ka'Ree.
The reason Sybok left Vulcan.

59:19.681 --> 59:23.059
Our destination
is the planet Sha'Ka'Ree,

59:24.394 --> 59:27.563
which lies beyond the Great Barrier

59:27.981 --> 59:29.982
at the centre of the gaIaxy.

59:31.151 --> 59:34.987
-The centre of the galaxy?
-Where Sha'Ka'Ree is fabled to exist.

59:35.781 --> 59:37.990
But the centre of the galaxy
can't be reached.

59:38.075 --> 59:39.742
No ship has ever gone
into the Great Barrier.

59:39.826 --> 59:41.327
No probe has ever returned.

59:41.411 --> 59:44.789
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect
l have ever known.

59:44.873 --> 59:47.333
Spock, my only concern
is getting the ship back.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.293
When that's done and Sybok is in here,

59:49.378 --> 59:53.172
then you can debate Sha'Ka'Ree
until you're green in the face.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.260
Until then, you're either with me
or you're not.

59:57.344 --> 01:00:00.846
-l am here, Captain.
-That's a little vague, Spock.

01:00:04.393 --> 01:00:06.060
What's that noise?

01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:12.441
l believe it is a primitive form
of communication

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.402
-known as Morse code.
-You're right.

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:17.697
l'm a little out of practise. That's an "S."

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:24.287
-"T."
-"A," "N," "D," end of word.

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:29.709
-"Stand."
-New word. "B," "A". . .

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:33.170
"C," "K."

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.548
"Back." "Stand back."

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:36.966
-Stand back?
-Stand back?

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.639
What are you standing around for?

01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:45.850
Do you not know a jail break
when you see one?

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.895
The bond between these three
is strong, difficult to penetrate.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.064
This will be quite a challenge.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.776
We've got to find them.

01:00:56.028 --> 01:00:59.530
-Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
-lf we could send a distress signal. . .

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:01.157
There is an emergency
sending apparatus

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:02.199
in the forward observation room.

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:04.660
The only trouble is, it's up there.
We're down here.

01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:07.747
You might be able to reach it by means
of turbo shaft number three,

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:11.709
which is closed for repairs.
lt's a long and dangerous climb.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:14.337
Some of us get off
on long and dangerous climbs.

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:16.255
Mr Scott, get the transporter working.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.341
lf we can contact a rescue ship,
we'll need it.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.675
Which way to the turbo shaft?

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.303
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent
and turn right.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:24.472
Then left at the blowscreen.
You can't miss it.

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:27.224
-Mr Scott, you're amazing.
-There's nothing amazing about it.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:30.436
l know this ship
like the back of my hand.

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:43.115
All right. Look at it this way,
we'll get a good workout.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.618
Yeah, or a heart attack.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.183
Get Mr Scott to sickbay.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:39.255
Jim, this is going to take me forever.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.263
Where's Spock?

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:53.686
l believe I have found a faster way.

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:07.783
Bones?

01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:10.744
You two go ahead.
l'll wait for the next car.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:12.496
We're not splitting up.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:21.922
-lt appears we're too heavy.
-Must be all those marsh melons.

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:25.968
Spock, the booster rockets.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:28.429
lf I activate them now, Captain,
we'll be propelled upward

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:30.264
at an unbelievable rate.

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:31.640
Fire the rockets!

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.060
Captain, please come back down. . .

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.234
Hit the brakes!

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.368
l'm afraid I overshot the mark
by one level.

01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:53.078
Nobody's perfect.

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:05.758
Spock.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.554
Emergency channel open.

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:12.431
To anyone within the sound of my voice,

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:15.768
this is Captain James T. Kirk
of the Federation Starship Enterprise.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.020
lf you read me, acknowledge.

01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:20.606
Acknowledge.

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:25.986
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Command.
We read you. Over.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.199
A hostile force has taken control
of our vessel

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:32.952
and put us on a direct course
with the Great Barrier.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.454
Our coordinates are 0-0-0. . .

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:37.456
-Mark 2.
-. . .mark 2.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:40.251
Request emergency assistance.
Acknowledge.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:45.297
Understood, Enterprise. We are
dispatching a rescue ship immediately.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:46.423
Roger, StarfIeet.

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:49.176
Plot course zero-zero-zero, mark two.

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:55.057
But Captain, that course will take us
into the Barrier as well.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:57.893
Where Kirk goes, we follow.

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:03.482
l trust your message was received.

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:07.069
You can't expect us to stand by while
you take the ship into the Great Barrier.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:10.322
What you fear is the unknown.

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:16.537
The people of your planet
once believed their world was flat.

01:05:17.289 --> 01:05:20.249
Columbus proved it was round.

01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:25.337
They said the sound barrier could never
be broken. lt was broken.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:29.425
They said warp speed
could not be achieved.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:36.307
The Great Barrier is the ultimate
expression of this universal fear.

01:05:38.018 --> 01:05:40.603
lt's an extension of personal fear.

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:43.772
Captain Kirk, I so much want
your understanding.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:48.694
l want your respect.
Are you afraid to hear me out?

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.989
l'm afraid of nothing.

01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:54.283
Wait outside.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:05.002
l'm sure you have many questions.

01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:09.757
Here, amidst the stars
of our own galaxy,

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:12.968
we shall seek the answers together.

01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:26.482
Easy. Easy. Easy, Scotty. Easy.
You're back with us.

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:29.234
Uhura, I had the strangest dream.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:31.278
l dreamt that a madman
had taken over the Enterprise.

01:06:31.363 --> 01:06:33.947
Scotty, dear, he's not a madman.

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:35.616
-He's not?
-No.

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:38.702
Sybok has simply put us in touch

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:42.331
with feelings that we've always been
afraid to express.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:47.002
-l have to get back to the transporter.
-No, no, no. Scotty! Scotty.

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:49.171
There's so much I want to tell you.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:53.092
Maybe you could wait
till l'm a wee bit stronger.

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:57.221
l don't think I could take it
in my present condition.

01:07:00.725 --> 01:07:01.850
Or yours.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:03.894
Sha'Ka'Ree.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:06.397
"The Source."

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.066
"Heaven."

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:11.860
"Eden."

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:16.031
Call it what you will.
The Klingons call it "Qui'Tu."

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:20.703
For the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor."
The Andorian word is. . .

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:23.080
ls unpronounceable.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.958
Still, every culture in existence
shares this common dream

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:31.630
of a place from which creation sprang.
For us, that place will soon be reality.

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:35.801
The only reality I see is
that l'm a prisoner on my own ship.

01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:39.972
What is this power you have
to control the minds of my crew?

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:44.309
l don't control minds. I free them.

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:49.273
How?

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:55.070
By making you face your pain,
and draw strength from it.

01:07:56.448 --> 01:07:59.533
Once that's done, fear cannot stop you.

01:08:06.332 --> 01:08:10.544
Sounds like brainwashing to me.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:13.380
-Your pain is the deepest of all.
-What?

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:16.675
l can feel it. Can't you?

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:19.470
Leonard.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:30.814
lt's some kind of trick.

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.194
Leonard.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.157
Father?

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:44.243
-Oh, my God, don't do this to me.
-Leonard.

01:08:57.008 --> 01:09:00.385
l'm here. l'm with you, Dad.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:02.970
The pain.

01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:05.974
Stop the pain.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:08.894
l've done everything I can do.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.939
You've got to hang on.

01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:14.483
l can't stand the pain.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:17.194
Help me.

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:22.241
All my knowledge, and I can't save him.

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:27.328
You've done all you can.
The support system will keep him alive.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.460
You call this alive?

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:35.546
Son,

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:41.801
-release me.
-l can't do that, Dad.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.515
But how?
How can I watch him suffer like this?

01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:50.602
You're a doctor.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:00.529
l'm his son.

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:06.637
Why did you do it?

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:15.562
To preserve his dignity.

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:22.277
That wasn't the worst of it.

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:23.362
-No.
-Was it?

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:24.863
-No!
-Share it.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:30.619
Not long after, they found a cure.
A goddamn cure!

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.245
So if you hadn't killed him,
he might have lived.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:35.123
No! I loved my father. I released him !

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:36.750
Then you did
what you thought was right.

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:38.794
Yes. No! Yes!

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:41.171
Release this pain. Release it!

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:45.926
This pain has poisoned your soul
for a long time.

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.306
Now you've taken the first step.

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:55.560
The other steps we'll take together.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.987
Each man's pain is unique.

01:12:06.406 --> 01:12:07.948
l hide no pain.

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:15.872
-l know you better than that.
-Do you?

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:18.667
-Spock, don't.
-lt's all right, Captain.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.087
Proceed.

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:31.596
-What is this?
-l believe we are witnessing my birth.

01:13:08.468 --> 01:13:11.011
Sarek, your son.

01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:15.807
So human.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:23.732
Spock?

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:45.796
-What have you done to my friends?
-l've done nothing.

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:48.840
This is who they are.
Didn't you know that?

01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:52.511
No, I didn't.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:56.181
-Now learn something about yourself.
-No. I refuse.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:14:00.435
-Jim, try to be open about this.
-About what?

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.940
That l've made
the wrong choices in my life?

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:07.234
That I turned left
when I should have turned right?

01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:08.568
l know what my weaknesses are.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:10.445
l don't need Sybok to take me
on a tour of them.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.280
lf you'd just unbend and allow yourself. . .

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:15.117
-And be brainwashed by this con man?
-l was wrong.

01:14:16.077 --> 01:14:19.204
-This con man took away my pain.
-Damn it, Bones, you're a doctor.

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.831
You know that pain and guilt
can't be taken away

01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:22.624
with the wave of a magic wand.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:26.461
They're the things we carry with us,
the things that make us who we are.

01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:29.131
lf we lose them, we lose ourselves.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:32.342
l don't want my pain taken away.
l need my pain !

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:36.513
Sybok, this is the Bridge.
We're in approach of the Great Barrier.

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.142
Captain, l'm afraid
you'll have to remain here.

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:42.727
Spock, Dr McCoy, come with me.

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:48.191
-Spock?
-l cannot go with you.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:52.112
-Why not?
-l belong here.

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:54.739
l don't understand.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:59.077
Sybok, you are my brother,
but you do not know me.

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:03.915
l am not the outcast boy
you left behind those many years ago.

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:08.795
Since that time, I have found myself,
and my place.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.924
l know who I am.
And I cannot go with you.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:22.267
l guess you'd better count me out, too.

01:15:25.605 --> 01:15:27.981
-Then I'll see you on the other side.
-Wait!

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:34.362
You know we'll never make it
through the Great Barrier.

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:38.366
But if we do, will that convince you
that my vision was true?

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:42.287
-Your vision?
-Given to me by God.

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:45.916
He waits for us on the other side.

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:49.377
You are mad.

01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:54.466
Am l?

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:58.303
We'll see.

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:27.666
They say no ship can survive this.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.460
l say they're wrong.
l say that danger is an illusion.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.545
We have no instrument readings.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:36.049
-ls it there or isn't it?
-Mr Sulu, full ahead.

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:38.593
Full ahead. Aye.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:38.361
ls it possible?

01:17:38.696 --> 01:17:40.196
Fascinating.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.743
Are we dreaming?

01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:50.874
lf we are, then life is a dream.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:21.112
lnstruments back online.

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:27.952
lncredible. There is a power source
emanating from the planet

01:18:28.788 --> 01:18:30.789
like nothing I have ever seen.

01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:36.878
Sha'Ka'Ree.

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:38.630
Qui'Tu.

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:40.423
Vorta Vor.

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:43.635
Eden.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.483
About the ship. . .

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:01.778
-The ship needs its captain.
-No special conditions?

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:03.988
No conditions.

01:19:06.826 --> 01:19:08.785
What makes you think
l won't turn us around?

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.663
Because you, too, must know.

01:19:16.836 --> 01:19:19.754
Well, if we're going to do it,
we're going to do it by the book.

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:22.674
Mr Chekov, you take the conn.
Mr Sulu, standard orbital approach.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:26.636
Uhura, alert the shuttlecraft to stand by.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:28.847
Sybok, Spock, Dr McCoy,
come with me.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:30.849
The rest of you remain onboard

01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:34.519
until l've determined
what it is we're dealing with.

01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:38.898
Well, don't just stand there.
God's a busy man.

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:31.451
l am no longer in control of the craft.

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:11.282
All right. We'll play it your way.

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:45.400
Amazing.

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:47.652
The land. The sky.

01:21:48.862 --> 01:21:50.989
Just as I knew it would be.

01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:39.495
Scotty, you gotta see this.

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:41.289
l don't have the time.

01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:43.791
The Captain told me
to get this transporter working,

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:46.044
and l'm not about to let him down.

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:21.764
We have travelled far

01:24:27.146 --> 01:24:28.521
by starship.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:39.824
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:43.786
We have a. . .

01:24:55.174 --> 01:24:56.257
Sybok.

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:01.846
Perhaps. . .

01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:23.112
Brave souÂ¡s, weÂ¡come.

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:32.121
ls this the voice of God?

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.251
One voice, many faces.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:53.184
Does this better suit your expectations?

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:11.911
It is I.

01:28:12.704 --> 01:28:17.041
The journey you undertook to reach me
couId not have been an easy one.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:20.544
lt was not. The Barrier stood
between us, but we breached it.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.339
Magnificent.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.009
You are the first to find me.

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:30.554
We sought only your infinite wisdom.

01:28:30.931 --> 01:28:33.766
And how did you breach the Barrier?

01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:35.559
With a starship.

01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:37.353
This starship,

01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:43.734
couId it carry my wisdom
beyond the Barrier?

01:28:44.528 --> 01:28:46.320
lt could. Yes.

01:28:46.405 --> 01:28:49.073
Then I shaII make use of this starship.

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.117
lt will be your chariot!

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:53.077
Excuse me.

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:56.998
It wiII carry my power
to every corner of creation.

01:28:57.082 --> 01:29:00.167
Excuse me.
l'd just like to ask a question.

01:29:02.254 --> 01:29:04.171
What does God need with a starship?

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:07.091
Bring the ship cIoser.

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:11.804
l said, what does God need
with a starship?

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:15.850
-Jim, what are you doing?
-l'm asking a question.

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:19.687
-Who is this creature?
-Who am l?

01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:25.151
-Don't you know? Aren't you God?
-He has his doubts.

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:27.611
You doubt me?

01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:29.697
l seek proof.

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:33.743
Jim, you don't ask the Almighty
for his lD.

01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:36.829
Then here is the proof you seek.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:51.844
-Why is God angry?
-Why?

01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:56.015
-Why have you done this to my friend?
-He doubts me.

01:29:56.558 --> 01:30:00.144
You have not answered his question.
What does God need with a starship?

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:11.989
Do you doubt me?

01:30:17.829 --> 01:30:24.251
l doubt any God
who inflicts pain for his own pleasure.

01:30:24.586 --> 01:30:28.506
Stop! The God of Sha'Ka'Ree
would not do this.

01:30:29.508 --> 01:30:31.467
Sha'Ka'Ree?

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:34.720
A vision you created.

01:30:38.517 --> 01:30:42.812
An eternity I've been imprisoned
in this pIace.

01:30:43.522 --> 01:30:45.106
The ship.

01:30:46.233 --> 01:30:48.526
I must have the ship.

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:54.365
Now, give me what I want.

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:58.536
Sybok, this is not
the God of Sha'Ka'Ree,

01:30:59.538 --> 01:31:01.247
or any other God.

01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:05.084
l don't understand.
Reveal yourself to me.

01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:19.181
What's wrong? Don't you Iike this face?
I have so many.

01:31:19.266 --> 01:31:21.809
But this one suits you best.

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:25.271
No, no, it's not possible.

01:31:26.148 --> 01:31:28.524
Bring me the ship, or I wiII destroy you.

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:33.737
-The ship.
-Bring it cIoser,

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:38.784
so that I might join with it.

01:31:39.703 --> 01:31:41.412
Do it,

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:49.420
or watch these puny things die horribIy.

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:57.970
-What have I done?
-Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully.

01:31:58.346 --> 01:31:59.763
-Spock.
-Sybok.

01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:03.184
This is my doing.
This is my arrogance, my vanity.

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:06.687
-Sybok, we must find a way. . .
-No! You must save yourselves.

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:09.273
Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.

01:32:15.447 --> 01:32:18.032
-l couldn't help but notice your pain.
-My pain?

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:20.451
lt runs deep. Share it with me.

01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:26.624
Enterprise, are you ready?

01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:29.460
ln firing position. Torpedo armed.

01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:32.129
But, Captain,
we're firing directly on your position.

01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:33.923
Send it down, Mr Chekov. Now!

01:32:42.849 --> 01:32:44.516
Run ! Go!

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:03.244
Sybok.

01:33:10.168 --> 01:33:11.502
Let's get out of here.

01:33:14.923 --> 01:33:16.715
Sulu, l've lost them.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.203
Spock, get us out of here.

01:33:57.841 --> 01:33:59.925
Thrusters are inoperative.

01:34:15.108 --> 01:34:17.818
-Mr Scott.
-Scotty here, sir.

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:20.195
Please tell me
the transporter is working.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.282
She's got partial power, sir.
l might be able to take two of you.

01:34:23.616 --> 01:34:25.743
Beam up Spock and Dr McCoy. Now.

01:34:26.244 --> 01:34:27.703
Now, just a damn minute.

01:34:33.084 --> 01:34:34.335
Thank you, Mr Scott.
Bring up the Captain.

01:34:34.419 --> 01:34:35.419
All right.

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.155
What about Jim?
We can't just leave him down there.

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:06.033
Please get a grip on yourself, Doctor.
Status report.

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:08.702
Klingon captain wishes
to name his terms, Mr Spock.

01:35:08.953 --> 01:35:10.371
On screen.

01:35:11.289 --> 01:35:14.249
This is Captain KIaa
of the KIingon Empire.

01:35:14.918 --> 01:35:17.628
Attempt to raise shieIds
or arm weapons,

01:35:18.213 --> 01:35:20.089
and I wiII destroy you.

01:35:20.173 --> 01:35:22.633
You are aIive for a singIe reason.

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:25.677
The renegade James T. Kirk.

01:35:26.763 --> 01:35:29.556
Hand him over,
and I wiII spare your Iives.

01:35:30.975 --> 01:35:33.435
My transporter stands ready
to beam him aboard.

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:37.147
-Captain Kirk is not among us.
-You Iie.

01:35:38.358 --> 01:35:43.070
l'm a Vulcan. l'm incapable of lying.
Captain Kirk is on the planet below.

01:35:43.154 --> 01:35:44.863
Then give me his coordinates!

01:35:50.829 --> 01:35:53.664
General, I am in need
of your assistance.

01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:55.416
My assistance?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.835
You are his superior officer.

01:35:58.503 --> 01:36:03.465
-l am a foolish old man.
-Damn you, sir. You will try.

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:14.309
KIingon Commander,
someone wishes to speak with you.

01:37:04.235 --> 01:37:06.528
So it's me you want,
you Klingon bastards.

01:37:07.572 --> 01:37:09.573
What are you waiting for?

01:37:35.016 --> 01:37:36.642
Release him !

01:37:36.726 --> 01:37:40.604
Kirk, my junior officer has something
he wants to say to you.

01:37:46.861 --> 01:37:50.656
l apologise.

01:37:58.122 --> 01:38:02.125
The attack upon your vessel
was not authorised by my government.

01:38:04.379 --> 01:38:07.214
Kirk, and now,

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:11.134
may I present our new gunner?

01:38:20.478 --> 01:38:21.645
Spock?

01:38:24.482 --> 01:38:26.358
Welcome aboard, Captain.

01:38:33.324 --> 01:38:38.078
-l thought I was going to die.
-Not possible.

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:40.581
You were never alone.

01:38:45.962 --> 01:38:49.214
Please, Captain,
not in front of the Klingons.

01:39:10.278 --> 01:39:13.363
Would you care for a wee nip
of Scotch whisky?

01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:19.286
l never thought l'd ever be drinking
with a Klingon.

01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:21.747
What are you two conspiring about?

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:25.667
We were just saying how far we've
come in such a short space of time.

01:39:25.752 --> 01:39:27.210
We certainly have.

01:39:31.633 --> 01:39:33.675
She has wonderful muscles.

01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:56.531
-Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen?
-We were speculating.

01:39:57.450 --> 01:39:59.326
ls God really out there?

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:04.915
Maybe he's not out there, Bones.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:08.669
Maybe he's right here.
Human heart.

01:40:14.342 --> 01:40:18.011
-Spock?
-l was thinking of Sybok.

01:40:19.097 --> 01:40:22.265
-l've lost a brother.
-Yes.

01:40:25.937 --> 01:40:27.854
l lost a brother once.

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:32.609
l was lucky. I got him back.

01:40:35.613 --> 01:40:38.907
l thought you said
men like us don't have families.

01:40:42.787 --> 01:40:44.287
l was wrong.

01:41:04.517 --> 01:41:06.768
Are you just gonna sit there
and pluck that thing,

01:41:06.853 --> 01:41:09.271
or are you gonna play something?

01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:22.826
Row, row, row your boat
GentIy down the stream

01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:26.663
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-Row, row, row your boat

01:41:26.748 --> 01:41:29.875
-Life is but a dream
-GentIy down the stream

01:41:29.959 --> 01:41:33.044
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-Row, row, row your boat

01:41:33.129 --> 01:41:36.465
-GentIy down the stream
-Life is but a dream

01:41:36.549 --> 01:41:39.551
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-Row, row, row your boat

01:41:39.635 --> 01:41:42.721
-GentIy down the stream
-Life is but a dream

01:41:42.805 --> 01:41:45.932
-MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
-Row, row, row your boat
