WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:08.309
And here you go, ma'am.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.211
That's one Four for $40,
got your tires rotated,

00:10.311 --> 00:11.779
oil change,

00:11.879 --> 00:14.382
car wash,
and here is your handshake.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.750
Ooh, you know what?
I owe you a receipt.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.486
Look, I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.554
Really?
(groaning)

00:21.355 --> 00:23.157
Calvin, man.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.525
Look at all these customers.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.926
(chuckles):
You're getting big money.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.595
I'm getting no money, Trey.

00:28.429 --> 00:29.863
I put out
these Four for $40 coupons

00:29.963 --> 00:32.433
to get business in the door,
but that's it.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.602
Everybody's coming in
for the deal and nothing else.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.704
No brake jobs or tune-ups.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.572
I just wish we can go back
to the good old days

00:38.672 --> 00:40.441
when cars were raggedy.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.276
What are you doing?

00:42.376 --> 00:44.545
Writing a receipt.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.114
On paper towel?

00:46.214 --> 00:48.549
Yes, on paper towel, Trey.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.519
Look, when Tina worked here,
she ordered the receipt books.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.020
But now I'm all out,

00:53.121 --> 00:55.789
so my receipts are
the quicker picker upper.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.394
Here you go.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.596
Have a nice day.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.998
How can I help you, sir?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.434
I want the Four for $40.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.702
Well, actually,
you need a coupon for that,

01:08.802 --> 01:11.705
which you have right there.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.476
Man, everybody got one of
these damn things.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.412
Well, uh, while you're here,

01:18.512 --> 01:19.747
maybe we can check your brakes.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.382
You know, stopping is
very important.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.984
I'm good.
Of course you are.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.254
Actually, there is
one more thing.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.255
Yes.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.289
Can I use your bathroom?

01:28.389 --> 01:29.990
Sure.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.559
Right up there.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.461
Ain't no paper towels, though.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.531
I am so sick of these coupons,

01:37.631 --> 01:39.267
I don't know what to do, man.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.001
What you want, Trey?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.970
(groans)

01:44.405 --> 01:46.207
This is gonna be awkward.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.242
'Cause I need...

01:48.342 --> 01:50.244
five Four for $40s.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.246
You don't have five cars.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.947
No, but when I saw your coupons,

01:54.047 --> 01:57.017
it was such a great deal,
it inspired me to become

01:57.117 --> 01:59.487
an oil change concierge.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.856
What the hell is an
oil change concierge?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.925
I bring in the car
for my clients,

02:05.025 --> 02:06.427
I charge them $80.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.329
You get your $40,
I get my $40.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.231
Everybody eats.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.366
Oh, e-everybody eats?

02:12.466 --> 02:13.767
This is my shop, Trey.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.036
Only I eat.
This ain't no damn buffet.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.809
Hey, Calvin.
How's it going?

02:21.909 --> 02:22.810
Great.

02:22.910 --> 02:23.944
Ah, perfect.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.679
I knew you'd be
in a bad mood.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.681
Okay, let's see.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.150
Lethargic,
shoulders slumped.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.719
Facial expression flat.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.354
I'd say you're suffering
from an acute case

02:33.454 --> 02:36.023
of situational
maladaptive stress.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.892
And a case of TMD.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.194
TM-- TMD?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.729
Too much Dave.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.965
You see, that I recognize.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.667
Classic misplaced anger.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.002
Bet you're wondering
why I'm so on it today, huh?

02:49.102 --> 02:51.339
I wasn't, but I'm sure
you're gonna tell me.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.842
Yes, I am. Now, see, I'm trying
to get my therapist license,

02:54.942 --> 02:56.744
so I can counsel vets
down at the VA.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.680
And I need to log 500 hours
of hands-on experience,

02:59.780 --> 03:01.915
so I'm asking you, Calvin,
why not let me

03:02.015 --> 03:04.285
help talk you through
whatever's bothering you?

03:04.385 --> 03:06.520
Well, right now,
you're bothering me.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.423
Okay, okay, great.
See, that's good.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.493
Let's dig a little deeper.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.963
(scoffs) Dave, it's like
I told you before.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.632
Black people,
we don't do therapy.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.835
All right? We're just not
a soft kind of people.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.738
If I wanted to sit
on my couch and cry,

03:24.838 --> 03:26.840
I'd watch the Clippers.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.311
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

03:30.411 --> 03:31.812
* Welcome to the hood. *

03:37.184 --> 03:39.420
Dave, I said no.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.421
Yeah, but...

03:40.521 --> 03:42.556
you didn't say "hell no."

03:42.656 --> 03:45.125
You notice how Dad never
follows Dave into a room?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.661
Brilliant observation.
Yeah.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.230
Guys, can I ask you something?

03:50.331 --> 03:52.266
Is it true that Black people
don't do therapy?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.335
What?
What? No, man.
That's ridiculous.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.869
Yeah, man. Lots of
Black people do therapy.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.471
I'm surprised at you, David.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.573
I didn't say it.
It was your dad.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.775
Mm. Yeah.
Oh, no, yeah,
that makes more sense.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.445
Yes, it does.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.079
Because when I have problems,

04:06.179 --> 04:08.048
I suffer on the inside,

04:08.148 --> 04:09.683
like a real man.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.819
Calvin, that is ridiculous.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.253
Will you just let me help you?

04:13.354 --> 04:15.489
Yeah, just give up, Pop.
He already in the house.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.759
You know what? Fine. Come on.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.695
All right, um, make
yourself comfortable.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.097
(groans)

04:24.197 --> 04:26.166
Not you two! Get out.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.269
Bye.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.973
Okay, um...

04:33.741 --> 04:35.309
All right, tell me
what's been bothering you.

04:35.409 --> 04:38.646
Well, business has been
a little slow lately,

04:38.746 --> 04:42.650
so I came up with this promotion
to bring in more customers.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.252
But now I'm losing money
on every one.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.921
Okay, well, why don't you just
end the promotion?

04:48.021 --> 04:50.023
Well, it's not that easy.

04:50.123 --> 04:54.328
See, I put the coupon
in the Pasadena PennySaver,

04:54.428 --> 04:58.031
and they're everywhere, so...

04:58.131 --> 04:59.667
Let's focus on the why.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.603
Here, put your head up.
Yeah.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.137
Well...

05:04.237 --> 05:05.906
Well, when Tina was
at the Pit Stop,

05:06.006 --> 05:08.509
all I had to do was
focus on fixing cars.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.412
I mean, she handled the books
and set the pricing,

05:11.512 --> 05:13.914
ordered the supplies. (sighs)

05:14.014 --> 05:16.450
She would've known
this promotion was a bad idea.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.619
See, now we're getting
to the good stuff.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.787
You are realizing

05:19.887 --> 05:22.155
that you need Tina
back at the shop.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.724
(sighs) Maybe so,

05:23.824 --> 05:26.059
but I can't ask her
to come back.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.295
I mean, she's got
her own business,

05:28.396 --> 05:29.897
and it's blowing up.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.199
The woman loves making cupcakes.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.967
Even if that's true,
Calvin,

05:34.067 --> 05:37.471
you need to tell Tina that
you need her back at the shop.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.508
There's strength
in vulnerability.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.744
Ah.

05:45.278 --> 05:48.482
There's also strength
in strength.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.456
(sighs) Thank you
for letting me use your kitchen.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.490
I mean,
I can't keep up

05:56.590 --> 05:58.992
with these stupid cupcakes.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.829
Do you know how many of
these damn things I've made

06:01.929 --> 06:03.130
in just this week alone?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.898
Guess.
I don't know.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.233
Guess.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.267
A thousand.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.869
A thousand?

06:11.338 --> 06:13.407
I'm only one woman.
(chuckles)

06:14.307 --> 06:16.209
Five hundred?
Okay.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.078
You do know that
"Black girl magic" doesn't mean

06:18.178 --> 06:20.113
that I can do actual magic,
right?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.882
Well, stop making me guess.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.484
I'm sorry. It's just that,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.018
you know,
I've been baking all day,

06:25.118 --> 06:27.488
I've got four more orders
to fill before I go to bed,

06:27.588 --> 06:29.322
and guess how much money
I'm gonna make

06:29.423 --> 06:30.658
after all of that.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.526
Three dollars?

06:34.795 --> 06:37.465
Gemma, I can find three dollars
in the couch.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.033
You told me to guess.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.335
I'm sorry, it's just that,
you know,

06:42.436 --> 06:45.005
making this little bit of money
is just not worth it.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.406
Especially
since I started teaching

06:46.507 --> 06:49.042
at your after-school
music program.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.746
I love
those little tone-deaf monsters.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.449
Aw, that's so sweet.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.951
Don't call them monsters
in front of the parents.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.321
You know, making cupcakes
isn't fun anymore.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.923
It feels like work.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.091
So, why don't you quit?

07:04.191 --> 07:06.627
I can't.
Calvin is so proud of me.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.862
Plus we've invested so much
in my business.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.799
Guess how much.
Nope. Not doing that.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.335
Wait. These are
for Noah Miller?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.771
Oh, yeah,
it's his birthday.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.773
Interesting.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.008
Not that I care,

07:21.108 --> 07:22.910
but Noah Miller didn't
invite Grover

07:23.010 --> 07:24.311
to his birthday party.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.713
Who's Noah Miller?

07:25.813 --> 07:28.516
You know, the kid Grover
invited to his party,

07:28.616 --> 07:30.884
who ate five pieces of pizza.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.319
And Noah's gift,

07:32.419 --> 07:34.488
they named a star
after Grover.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.323
How do we know that's even true?

07:37.424 --> 07:40.528
I'm sensing an underlying issue
here, Gemma.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.997
Why is this invitation
bothering you so much?

07:44.097 --> 07:45.432
It's not.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.035
I was just telling you,
in case it bothered you.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.670
It's not bothering me at all.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.672
Cool. Me neither. (scoffs)

07:51.772 --> 07:54.307
I don't care at all.
Not a bit.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.643
(chuckles)

07:56.476 --> 07:57.310
Seems like you care.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.946
I care so much.
Yeah.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.850
(groans)

08:06.987 --> 08:09.056
When did this porch
get all these steps?

08:11.258 --> 08:13.160
Dad. Dad, you okay?

08:13.260 --> 08:14.361
Oh.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.063
Why are you all wet?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.432
I washed a few cars
at the shop today.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.234
14, to be exact.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.036
Uh, why would you do that?

08:23.136 --> 08:25.806
Well, I had a bunch of
those Four for $40s.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.876
My guys couldn't get them
all done before closing,

08:28.976 --> 08:31.211
and I can't afford
to pay 'em overtime, so...

08:31.311 --> 08:33.847
(groaning)

08:35.048 --> 08:37.818
I'm just gonna take
a little break right here.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.053
Okay, I hate to see
you like this.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.822
You shouldn't be working
yourself this hard, Dad.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.424
You know what?
You're right.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.627
You should.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.061
Yes.

08:48.161 --> 08:51.732
I expect to see you two
at the Pit Stop at 7:00 a.m.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.467
BYOB, bring your
own bucket.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.106
(groaning)

08:59.873 --> 09:02.475
You have never known
when to shut up.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.219
(groaning)

09:14.855 --> 09:15.956
Hey, babe!

09:16.056 --> 09:18.792
Hey! Hey, babe.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.293
How was your day?

09:20.393 --> 09:23.631
Oh, busy. Busy, busy, busy.
Oh.

09:23.731 --> 09:26.433
Yeah, you know,
this Four for $40 thing

09:26.533 --> 09:28.802
has got people lined up
out the door.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.605
I mean, I am beat, but...

09:31.705 --> 09:32.806
it's all good.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.808
Oh. Good, good, good. Me, too.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.944
You know, I can't make
these cupcakes fast enough.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.246
(chuckles):
Yeah.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.414
You know what, babe?
I was thinking, if, uh...

09:41.514 --> 09:44.451
if it becomes too much for you,
you-you should take a break.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.820
You know what? In fact,
you could...
What?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.889
Don't be silly, baby.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.457
I love what I do.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.661
And I owe it to
all of your support.

09:53.761 --> 09:54.962
I am living the dream!

09:55.062 --> 09:56.496
(chuckles forcefully)

09:59.633 --> 10:00.834
Well, good.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.570
Good. That's
what I was hoping you'd say.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.574
Yep.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.876
I am so happy.

10:08.976 --> 10:12.680
It's killing me,
but I love it. (laughs)

10:13.681 --> 10:15.048
I know how you feel.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.985
I know exactly how you feel.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.187
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.390
We are so lucky.
(laughs)

10:23.490 --> 10:25.893
Blessed and highly favored.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.661
Yes, we are.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.737
We washed nine cars, Pop.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.273
Now we have to get back
to our real jobs.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.710
Well, what do you have to do
that's so important?

10:42.810 --> 10:45.245
Well, we're launching a probe
from Vandenberg Air Force Base

10:45.345 --> 10:48.115
to find life
outside our solar system.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.385
And I have to help a freshman
with his bunt.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.023
Which is just as important.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.158
Hold up, uh, guys, hold up.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.993
You know, there is
one more thing, and I...

11:00.093 --> 11:01.795
I hate to do this to you,

11:01.895 --> 11:03.196
but...

11:03.296 --> 11:05.065
business is down a little bit,

11:05.165 --> 11:07.067
and, um...

11:07.167 --> 11:10.303
Well, I'm raising your rent,
by 15%.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.272
What?
Come on, Pop.
That's not fair.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.541
Look, you're doing well
for yourselves,

11:14.641 --> 11:17.344
and it's time that
you pay market price.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.512
Look, you're both grown-ass men.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.581
Yeah, but, Daddy,
we don't want to be.

11:22.549 --> 11:23.516
Oh...

11:23.616 --> 11:25.152
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.755
(grunts) I got as many
as I could find.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.022
I got more in the car.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.058
(chuckles)
That's good work, Trey.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.826
Wait, wait, wait,
so your solution

11:32.926 --> 11:35.963
to this coupon mess is
to steal the PennySavers?

11:36.063 --> 11:38.431
Well, it's not stealing
if they're free.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.635
Besides, have you seen
the price of motor oil?

11:42.736 --> 11:43.971
You know what?

11:44.071 --> 11:45.472
I know a guy who knows a guy

11:45.572 --> 11:47.040
who can get motor oil cheap.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.408
Nope.
Oh...

11:48.508 --> 11:50.177
All right, okay.
Wha-What's the catch, Trey?

11:50.277 --> 11:52.712
I'm the catch.
I'm the guy who knows a guy.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.016
I bet you get your oil
from a distributor.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.351
Bad move.
Never pay wholesale.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.720
Wh-What's before wholesale?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.823
I can't explain the economy
to you.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.293
You want the oil or not?

12:06.393 --> 12:07.795
Yeah, I want the oil.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.163
Wait, Dad, are you really
that desperate?

12:10.263 --> 12:12.165
Well, it's either this

12:12.265 --> 12:14.534
or I raise your rent again.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.469
Trey, call your boy.
Yeah, call him.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.305
MALCOLM: Call him.
Put him on the phone.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.678
I don't like this, Calvin.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.247
Would you be cool, man.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.882
We're just a couple of guys,

12:28.982 --> 12:31.318
buying suspiciously cheap
motor oil

12:31.418 --> 12:33.620
in a warehouse.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.458
Yeah, a dark, empty warehouse,
in...

12:38.558 --> 12:41.194
in an unincorporated area.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.596
Will you relax?

12:43.696 --> 12:46.466
Okay, fine. But, you know,
we wouldn't be in this situation

12:46.566 --> 12:48.635
if you were just willing
to confront your issue

12:48.735 --> 12:49.970
and open up to Tina.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.372
(rattling)

12:53.573 --> 12:56.276
Okay, uh, which one of
these guys is your guy?

12:56.376 --> 12:58.711
I don't know these guys.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.115
What do you mean
you don't know these guys?

13:02.215 --> 13:04.051
This guy I know knows
these other guys

13:04.151 --> 13:05.819
who know these guys,
I assume.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.254
Okay.
Oh, come on.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.890
Which one of you is
buying the oil?

13:09.990 --> 13:12.725
(mutters) Uh...
Oh, Calvin is.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.328
You never say a guy's real name
in a warehouse.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.730
You got the money, Calvin?

13:17.831 --> 13:20.567
Oh, great,
he's using my name.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.771
You got the goods?

13:24.872 --> 13:26.173
Yes, I have the goods.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.640
What do you think is
in these boxes?

13:27.740 --> 13:29.877
The heads of my enemies?
(scoffs)

13:29.977 --> 13:32.145
That was weirdly specific.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.547
I'm kidding. It was a joke.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.683
(laughter)

13:36.783 --> 13:38.818
It was a joke
about heads being in boxes.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.221
He's funny. He's funny.
That's why it's funny, you know.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.590
Uh...

13:43.690 --> 13:47.027
I would like to see the goods
before I give you the money.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.828
Show him the oil.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.302
This smells like piña colada.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.204
(sniffing)

13:57.304 --> 13:59.873
It's from Fiji. They blend it
with coconut oil.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.610
I'm not putting coconut oil
in my customer's vehicles.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.579
I don't care what you do
with it, it's yours.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.184
Now pay me, before
I put your heads in boxes.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.886
(laughter)
Again.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.321
He did it again. Yeah.
I love it,
with the heads in the boxes.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.655
He always goes to it.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.791
Okay, so it's not a joke.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.260
Here you go.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.430
Pleasure doing business
with you, Calvin.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.333
That's Mr. Butler to you.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.667
Okay, Dave,
what are you gonna do?

14:27.767 --> 14:30.237
Give the guy my mother's
maiden name, too?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.647
Gemma? They said
you needed to see me.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.082
Did Noah do something?

14:42.182 --> 14:44.417
No, no, no! Holly!
I just wanted to catch up.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.585
Come.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.354
Sit, sit, sit. (chuckles)

14:49.856 --> 14:51.324
I don't think I ever thanked you

14:51.424 --> 14:53.560
for your help
with the school carnival.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.662
Two years ago?

14:55.762 --> 14:58.999
There's no statute of
limitations on gratitude, hmm?

14:59.099 --> 15:00.733
That's what I always say.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.469
(laughs)

15:02.569 --> 15:05.205
Hey, Noah is getting so big.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.639
Is he 13 yet?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.075
Almost.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.378
Well, his birthday must be
right around the corner, eh?

15:11.478 --> 15:12.980
That's great!

15:14.314 --> 15:15.915
Do you need me
to volunteer for something?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.884
No! No, no, no.

15:17.985 --> 15:21.121
Nope. You're probably too busy
with that birthday coming up.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.323
Did you say the party was
this weekend?
I didn't.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.525
Cut the crap, Holly,
I know about the cupcakes!

15:30.163 --> 15:32.732
No. It wasn't in Whittier,

15:32.832 --> 15:34.901
and it wasn't in La Mirada.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.204
Like Cerritos?

15:37.304 --> 15:39.606
I wish it was in Cerritos.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.775
So it was
in an unincorporated area.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.811
Yeah, that's why
it was so scary.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.215
A lawless hellscape.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.085
Well, my afternoon
was no picnic.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.454
I kind of went off
on Noah's mom.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.556
Oh, my gosh. Why?

15:56.656 --> 16:00.460
I really wanted to get Grover
an invite to that stupid party.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.495
Okay, Gemma.

16:02.595 --> 16:03.863
Let me help you.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.566
Why is this invitation
so important to you?

16:06.666 --> 16:10.970
I mean, there must be
some sort of underlying issue.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.073
There's no issue.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.408
I would tell you.
I don't keep secrets.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.344
I mean, you've seen
my seventh grade haircut.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.079
The bangs.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.848
Okay. Gemma.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.850
Relax, okay?

16:23.950 --> 16:25.952
Lean back,
take a deep breath.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.855
Think back to a time
when you were a kid,

16:28.955 --> 16:31.058
or maybe a teenager. Was...

16:31.158 --> 16:32.692
Was there ever a time
that you felt left out?

16:32.792 --> 16:35.862
Or, I don't know, maybe...
maybe like you didn't fit in?

16:35.962 --> 16:37.964
(crying)

16:42.035 --> 16:44.137
(whimpers)

16:45.372 --> 16:47.640
(crying):
You're good.

16:49.776 --> 16:50.877
Well, thank you.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.946
Now, where's Gemma?

16:54.047 --> 16:55.915
Where did Gemma go?

16:56.716 --> 16:59.086
It was my first year
of middle school.
Mm-hmm.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.122
There was this program
called "HAM."

17:02.889 --> 17:04.457
High Achieving Math.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.561
You stayed after school four
days a week and did algebra.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.431
And that's something
your parents made you do?

17:12.299 --> 17:14.134
(crying):
I wish.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.371
I didn't get in.
All my friends did.

17:18.471 --> 17:23.009
And those "Hamsters"
taunted me about it forever.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.515
So, you didn't get to
stay late at school

17:28.615 --> 17:33.153
and do difficult math
with a bunch of little jerks?

17:33.253 --> 17:36.123
(crying):
It was horrible!

17:38.325 --> 17:40.293
I was in such a dark place,

17:40.393 --> 17:42.129
I gave myself that haircut.
Yeah.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.464
It was me! I was
the one who did it!
I know. I know.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.599
I know, it's okay.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.738
I just don't want Grover
to ever feel the way I did.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.541
Finished my homework.
Can I play video games?

17:54.641 --> 17:55.908
Oh! Mom's crying.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.477
No.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.312
Grover.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.582
Mom is having a breakthrough.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.385
Is that why there's
so much snot?

18:07.654 --> 18:09.055
(sniffles, sighs)

18:09.922 --> 18:11.491
Hey, pumpkin.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.793
I need to tell you something,

18:13.893 --> 18:16.229
because you're probably
gonna hear about it at school.

18:16.329 --> 18:21.401
Noah is having a birthday party,
but you weren't invited.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.002
Okay.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.375
Wait. You're not upset?

18:28.475 --> 18:29.676
No.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.578
In class, he raises his hand
for every question,

18:31.678 --> 18:34.547
and then he asks the teacher if
she forgot to give us homework.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.117
If the teacher forgets
to assign us homework,

18:38.218 --> 18:39.719
we don't have homework.

18:39.819 --> 18:40.887
That's the rule.

18:40.987 --> 18:41.921
No, that's not true.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.122
I don't make the rules, Mom.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.491
The eighth graders do.

18:44.591 --> 18:45.658
(chuckles)

18:48.728 --> 18:50.230
(sighs)

18:51.731 --> 18:53.200
Oh, there you are.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.067
Where you been?
You didn't answer your phone.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.103
I didn't have any service.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.871
I was out by Bellflower.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.340
Near Hacienda Heights?

19:00.440 --> 19:03.343
(scoffs) I wish I was
near Hacienda Heights.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.712
It was closer to Cerritos.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.649
What were you doing
in an unincorporated area?

19:09.749 --> 19:13.085
I was just buying oil,
and, uh...

19:13.186 --> 19:15.087
I might be changing my name.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.457
Don't ask.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.661
Uh-oh, this doesn't seem
like nothing.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.597
It's-it's just been
a rough couple of weeks

19:24.697 --> 19:25.865
down at the shop.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.234
Weeks?

19:27.334 --> 19:28.801
Well, why didn't you tell me
about this?

19:28.901 --> 19:30.370
We tell each other everything.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.005
We do, don't we?

19:33.105 --> 19:34.106
Yeah.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.642
Aw, hell.

19:35.742 --> 19:39.111
Dave said that there's
strength in vulnerability.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.713
What?

19:41.548 --> 19:44.917
Here it is. Look, Tina, ever
since you left the Pit Stop,

19:45.017 --> 19:47.287
it just hasn't been the same.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.122
And I wish
I could have you back, but...

19:50.223 --> 19:52.058
I could never ask you
to give up your cupcakes.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.726
Done.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.063
What?

19:57.163 --> 19:59.131
Uh, th-they're gone.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.800
You need me
down at the Pit Stop,

20:00.900 --> 20:02.335
so screw the cupcakes.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.672
Really?
Really.

20:05.772 --> 20:09.008
As your wife, I am willing
to make that sacrifice.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.612
And as your husband,
I'm not buying it.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.814
That was too fast.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.483
Okay, you got me.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.751
I am sick of
these damn cupcakes!

20:20.720 --> 20:22.054
Are you serious?

20:22.154 --> 20:23.456
Why didn't you say anything?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.592
Because you were so proud of me,

20:25.692 --> 20:27.494
and we put so much money
into the business.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.128
I didn't want to let you down.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.265
Tina, you could never
let me down.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.567
You're the most incredible
woman I've ever known.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.336
Aw...

20:36.436 --> 20:39.406
I'm so glad we're honest
with each other.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.608
Are you sure you want to
give up your business?

20:41.708 --> 20:43.476
Positive.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.979
Then welcome back to
the Pit Stop.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.915
(chuckles)
I missed you.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.216
I missed you, too, baby.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.584
Mm-mm. Mm.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.920
(timer dings)
Oh, cupcakes.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.622
Let 'em burn.
