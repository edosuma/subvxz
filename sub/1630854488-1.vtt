So, why consulting? Why not take over the family business?

08:43.155 --> 08:46.626
I'm not interested in answering to my parents.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.169
And you make this kind of money from Il Formaggio?

08:57.236 --> 09:00.339
[Owen] Ah, I actually own a hospitality group.

09:00.406 --> 09:05.278
And we operate several nightclubs, restaurants.

09:05.344 --> 09:09.282
Oh, that's how you've seen every designer dress ever made.

09:10.783 --> 09:13.052
You talk a lot about money.

09:13.119 --> 09:17.790
I find people who talk a lot about it usually don't have it.

09:17.857 --> 09:20.059
Or don't have a good relationship with it.

09:27.366 --> 09:31.237
and I enjoy talking about my friends.

09:31.304 --> 09:35.174
This one is striking. It's a bit forlorn.

-Hm. -Yeah, she's an emerging artist.

09:44.350 --> 09:47.520
I've always hated Romeo And Juliet.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.754
Not a romantic?

09:48.821 --> 09:50.456
There's nothing romantic about two kids

09:50.523 --> 09:53.626
thinking they're in love and then killing themselves over it.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.896
Oh, so an expert on romance, are we?

09:56.963 --> 10:00.466
Hardly, but I know a thing or two about farce.

10:00.533 --> 10:04.337
All they had to do was tell each other they were playing dead.

10:04.403 --> 10:08.074
Then they could have had their happy ending.

10:08.140 --> 10:11.410
But it's just not Romeo And Juliet with a happy ending.

10:13.145 --> 10:18.017
Then thank goodness we're not Juliet and Romeo.

10:44.076 --> 10:45.211
Wow.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.086
You were right. I didn't come from money.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.025
Okay.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.862
But what does that matter?

11:02.928 --> 11:04.864
Status is important, isn't it?

11:04.930 --> 11:08.000
Look, my parents didn't always have money.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.437
And even when they did, there was no silver spoon.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.972
They expected me to build from the ground up,

11:13.039 --> 11:15.107
just like they did.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.144
I had to fend for myself, I had to figure out ways

11:18.210 --> 11:22.148
to create success and build respect.

11:22.214 --> 11:24.717
Are they proud of what you've built?

11:25.785 --> 11:28.621
Ah, there's respect.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.524
They stay out of my way.

11:31.590 --> 11:35.828
But you, you forged your own way

11:35.895 --> 11:37.863
and can shop on Nassau Street.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.433
And that deserves respect, don't you think?

11:42.001 --> 11:43.769
You're self-made, Sadie.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.439
I like that about you.

11:49.442 --> 11:54.313
To making your own way and getting to the top.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.816
And to doing it by your own hard work.

12:02.188 --> 12:05.491
There's more. I'll get the bottle. Need anything?

Now, that dress is fabulous.

13:13.192 --> 13:15.594
-Where'd you get it? -Here. Just yesterday.

13:15.661 --> 13:18.364
And it definitely helped make for a memorable night.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.766
As it should have. You look amazing in it.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.404
-Almost every day. -Then you must know what's good.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.773
Yes. I'm very familiar with Briana's inventory.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.577
She's my cousin. Are you looking for anything in particular?

13:31.644 --> 13:34.613
[sighs] I need a dress for a party tonight.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.516
The latest arrivals are on that rack over there.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.756
So you bought this dress yesterday and came back today?

13:43.823 --> 13:46.392
I actually consult for the store, I'm a brand advisor,

13:46.458 --> 13:48.828

I just, I don't understand why you're being so hard on me

55:35.432 --> 55:37.233
for being a supportive friend.

55:37.300 --> 55:40.904
And I offered to call the cops, you're the one who said no.

55:40.970 --> 55:42.872
So I helped you clean up, and I got rid of the body,

55:42.939 --> 55:46.876
despite my better judgement, all to help you.

55:48.411 --> 55:51.915
Look, I'm not even mad. I...

55:51.981 --> 55:55.752
The truth is, I've never had a friend like you before.

55:55.819 --> 56:00.123
Someone who understands me, someone I can trust.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.359
I know after everything we've been through,

56:02.425 --> 56:04.928
that I can trust you, and that's huge.

56:06.429 --> 56:07.997
You're...

56:08.064 --> 56:10.567
You're the first real friend I've ever had.

56:12.669 --> 56:15.405
Just why you're worth doing all of this for.

56:17.874 --> 56:19.909
Oh. It's...

56:23.046 --> 56:24.080
No.

56:30.286 --> 56:31.921
[Jessica snorting]

56:38.428 --> 56:40.530
Ready for the weekend of our lives?

[dramatic music]

56:52.208 --> 56:54.544
[cell phone ringing]

56:55.345 --> 56:57.747
It's me. What you got?

56:59.249 --> 57:00.917
Absolutely nothing?

57:02.685 --> 57:05.655
Yeah. Thanks. I'll be in touch.

[telephone ringing]

57:40.056 --> 57:41.825
-Detective Drous. -Where'd we get that?

57:41.891 --> 57:43.493
[Drous] A friend of Caruso's came forward with it.

57:43.560 --> 57:44.961
Got it from him that night.

57:45.028 --> 57:47.030
Might be the last image of him alive.

57:47.096 --> 57:49.599
And that painting behind him? Original?

57:49.666 --> 57:52.168
Can't say yet, but, uh, we're tracing it.

57:52.235 --> 57:54.471
When you get a hit, I want a damn warrant.

57:54.537 --> 57:57.674
[footsteps approaching]

58:05.281 --> 58:07.150
[instrumental music]

58:08.885 --> 58:11.354
You sure you can't give me just 20 more minutes?

58:11.421 --> 58:13.723
I can't. I have an appointment with a client.

58:13.790 --> 58:15.391
Well, what if I want to be a client, too?

58:15.458 --> 58:17.961
Then I'd still have to make the appointment with this one.

58:18.027 --> 58:20.797
[chuckles] Fair enough.

58:20.864 --> 58:22.732
I almost forgot. I got this for you.

58:22.799 --> 58:25.401
-Oh, what's this? -You'll see.

58:25.468 --> 58:27.804
Just something silly, really.

58:29.806 --> 58:33.943
It's an antique. I saw it and I couldn't resist.

58:37.113 --> 58:39.616
And it's the perfect travel size, so you could take it

58:39.682 --> 58:41.184
with you on your trips.

58:41.251 --> 58:43.753
You never know when that desire will strike.

58:44.888 --> 58:46.623
I know it's a little cheesy, but--

58:46.689 --> 58:48.858
No, no. Come here.

58:48.925 --> 58:52.996
This is the most thoughtful gift anyone has ever given me.

58:53.830 --> 58:55.698
I'm glad you like it.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.435
I know it's not the most polished thing,

58:59.502 --> 59:02.639
but it reminded me of your story.

59:02.705 --> 59:05.575
-So... -No. I love it.

59:08.378 --> 59:10.613
Uh, listen.

59:10.680 --> 59:13.683
I have another trip at the end of this week,

59:13.750 --> 59:16.252
and I was wondering if maybe you'd like

59:16.319 --> 59:18.021
to come with me this time?

59:19.422 --> 59:21.424
-I'd love to. -Yeah?

59:21.491 --> 59:23.793
-Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah?

59:26.529 --> 59:27.997
-For ten minutes? -No...

59:28.064 --> 59:29.666
-Fifteen? -I gotta go.

59:29.732 --> 59:32.335
-Okay. Okay. Okay. -Okay.

[eerie music]

1:00:15.211 --> 1:00:16.479
[Gloria] Mr. Hunt?

1:00:16.546 --> 1:00:18.047
-Yes. -I'm Detective Brown.

1:00:18.114 --> 1:00:20.149
We have a warrant to search the property.

1:00:24.487 --> 1:00:26.155
Oh. Come-come on in.

1:00:41.571 --> 1:00:45.375
-[cell phone ringing] -Hello?

1:00:45.441 --> 1:00:48.144
[manager] Hello. I'm trying to reach Sadie Williams.

1:00:48.211 --> 1:00:49.545
This is Sadie.

1:00:49.612 --> 1:00:51.581
Sadie, I'm the hotel manager at the Geordana,

1:00:51.648 --> 1:00:54.283
and I'm calling to let you know we will be charging your card

1:00:54.350 --> 1:00:57.220
and additional $3500.

1:00:57.286 --> 1:00:59.822
But I've already paid the $4000 room charge.

1:00:59.889 --> 1:01:01.224
-There must be a mistake. -I'm sorry.

1:01:01.290 --> 1:01:02.792
This isn't a mistake, Ms. Williams.

1:01:02.859 --> 1:01:04.861
The charges are for the damages to the room.

1:01:04.927 --> 1:01:07.463
Damages? What are you talking about?

1:01:07.530 --> 1:01:09.032
We take damages very seriously.

1:01:09.098 --> 1:01:11.401
What damages? I'm prepared to contest this.

1:01:11.467 --> 1:01:13.069
Ma'am, let me additionally inform you, we have

1:01:13.136 --> 1:01:15.071
opted not to call the police regarding

1:01:15.138 --> 1:01:17.306
the illegal paraphernalia we found in the room.

1:01:17.373 --> 1:01:19.342
-Illegal paraphernalia? -Yes.

1:01:19.409 --> 1:01:21.477
We have every right to alert the authorities, and may be forced

1:01:21.544 --> 1:01:24.947
to do so if you attempt to contest the charges.

1:01:26.115 --> 1:01:29.786
I see. That won't be necessary. Thank you.

1:01:33.923 --> 1:01:35.692
-[line ringing] -[Jessica] It's Jessica.

1:01:35.758 --> 1:01:38.161
Busy as usual. Text me.

1:01:42.398 --> 1:01:44.834
[sighs] Shit!

1:01:44.901 --> 1:01:46.536
[Owen] I've never seen this man before in my life,

1:01:46.602 --> 1:01:49.839
nor have I ever heard the name of Justin Caruso.

1:01:49.906 --> 1:01:52.508
And how do you explain him being in your house?

1:01:52.575 --> 1:01:54.177
[sighs] I can't.

1:01:55.311 --> 1:01:57.747
But I was out of town for a few days.

1:01:57.814 --> 1:02:01.050
-Where were you? -On a business trip.

1:02:03.052 --> 1:02:04.387
So, what, did this guy break into my house?

1:02:04.454 --> 1:02:07.490
Have you noticed any locks not working properly?

1:02:07.557 --> 1:02:08.891
-Any broken windows? -No.

1:02:08.958 --> 1:02:10.693
-Is anything missing? -No.

1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:12.862
None of this makes any sense.

1:02:21.704 --> 1:02:24.841
I think it's time for my lawyer to join the conversation.

1:02:24.907 --> 1:02:27.009
[intense music]

1:02:28.544 --> 1:02:30.079
It's over $10,000, Sadie.

1:02:30.146 --> 1:02:31.748
I'm sorry. I'll pay you back.

1:02:31.814 --> 1:02:33.750
Oh, and how do you expect to do that? Huh?

1:02:33.816 --> 1:02:35.384
I swear, I didn't wreck that hotel room.

1:02:35.451 --> 1:02:38.254
No? Because that's what I said when the hotel first called me.

1:02:38.321 --> 1:02:40.256
But then they sent me a clip from security footage of

1:02:40.323 --> 1:02:42.959
you checking in, with the company credit card!

1:02:43.025 --> 1:02:47.363
-[Sadie] I can ex-- -Don't bother. You're fired!

1:02:47.430 --> 1:02:49.999
You know, I was gracious enough to help you turn things around,

1:02:50.066 --> 1:02:52.034
but here you are, doing exactly the same thing

1:02:52.101 --> 1:02:54.337
that you've always done, lying and stealing!

1:02:54.403 --> 1:02:57.206
-I'm sorry, Bri, I-- -And the Mutiyago dress?

1:02:57.940 --> 1:03:00.176
I know it was you.

1:03:00.243 --> 1:03:03.379
It's a $7000 dress, Sadie.

1:03:03.446 --> 1:03:04.814
[grunts]

1:03:04.881 --> 1:03:06.816
I have half a mind to call the cops on you.

1:03:06.883 --> 1:03:08.217
-Bri... -You know, I always knew...

1:03:08.284 --> 1:03:10.753
That your father was a dirty criminal.

1:03:10.820 --> 1:03:14.190
And I always really hated him, mostly because of you.

1:03:14.257 --> 1:03:16.626
And I always thought that one day you would be free from that,

1:03:16.692 --> 1:03:18.761
from his will and his charm,

1:03:18.828 --> 1:03:20.596
and that you could make your own life

1:03:20.663 --> 1:03:22.598
with your own moral compass.

1:03:24.834 --> 1:03:26.235
Clearly, I was wrong.

1:03:28.671 --> 1:03:30.406
You're just like him.

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:34.443
You don't really mean that.

1:03:36.012 --> 1:03:38.881
I can't have you near me or my family.

1:03:38.948 --> 1:03:40.449
Please, get out.

1:03:42.485 --> 1:03:44.487
Get out!

-[cell phone ringing] -Jess.

1:03:55.565 --> 1:03:59.035
[Jessica] Sorry I missed your call. You okay?

1:03:59.101 --> 1:04:02.271
What's up? Sadie?

1:04:02.338 --> 1:04:05.174
[sniffles] I called because the hotel's charging us

1:04:05.241 --> 1:04:06.709
a ton for room damages.

1:04:06.776 --> 1:04:09.378
What? We totally cleaned up.

1:04:11.347 --> 1:04:13.549
It's not worth crying over, Sadie.

1:04:13.616 --> 1:04:15.618
[Sadie] No, it's, it's not that. I...

1:04:15.685 --> 1:04:17.520
I just got in a big fight with Briana.

1:04:17.587 --> 1:04:20.289
I had never thought she could be so cruel,

1:04:20.356 --> 1:04:22.458
but she said some really hurtful things.

1:04:22.525 --> 1:04:25.194
Okay, where are you? Do you want me to come pick you up?

1:04:25.261 --> 1:04:27.230
[Sadie] No, no. It's okay.

1:04:27.296 --> 1:04:29.232
I just need a minute alone.

1:04:34.837 --> 1:04:37.974

[Owen] You've reached Owen Hunt, sorry, can't make it

1:04:55.725 --> 1:04:57.293
to the phone right now.

1:04:57.360 --> 1:05:00.496
[indistinct radio chatter]

1:05:29.458 --> 1:05:30.426
[lock clicks]

1:05:43.706 --> 1:05:46.609
I hear you've been messing with my friend.

1:05:46.676 --> 1:05:48.444
You heard wrong.

1:05:48.511 --> 1:05:51.580
You mess with her, you mess with me.

1:05:53.649 --> 1:05:54.750
Noted.

1:05:56.752 --> 1:05:58.254
Don't you dare.

-[banging on door] -I said coming!

1:06:49.939 --> 1:06:51.474
Sadie Williams?

1:06:51.540 --> 1:06:53.642
You're under arrest for the assault and attempted murder

1:06:53.709 --> 1:06:54.910
of Briana Jenkins.

1:06:54.977 --> 1:06:56.178
Wait, Briana?

1:06:56.245 --> 1:06:58.114
You have the right to remain silent.

1:06:58.180 --> 1:06:59.148
Wait. What-what happened?

1:06:59.215 --> 1:07:00.616
Anything you say can and will be

1:07:00.683 --> 1:07:04.253
used against you in a court of law.

1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:06.422
I don't know how many times I've told you already.

1:07:06.489 --> 1:07:09.592
I didn't hurt Briana. She is my cousin.

1:07:09.658 --> 1:07:11.794
Are you aware that Mrs. Jenkins was in the process

1:07:11.861 --> 1:07:13.195
of reporting you for theft?

1:07:13.262 --> 1:07:16.032
-I was working it out with her. -Hm.

1:07:16.098 --> 1:07:18.834
Does filing a police report sound like working it out?

1:07:20.803 --> 1:07:22.705
I'm-I'm being framed.

1:07:22.772 --> 1:07:25.074
-Framed? -It's true.

1:07:25.141 --> 1:07:27.643
[scoffs] Who would wanna frame you?

1:07:28.411 --> 1:07:31.414
Jessica. Jessica Davis.

1:07:33.682 --> 1:07:35.551
This can't be happening.

1:07:35.618 --> 1:07:38.054
Why is your name in our system, Sadie?

1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:39.855
That was a long time ago.

1:07:43.125 --> 1:07:46.529
And your father, Greg Williams...

1:07:47.730 --> 1:07:50.633
petty theft, fraud,

1:07:50.699 --> 1:07:52.268
robbery, larceny,

1:07:52.334 --> 1:07:56.338
assault with a deadly weapon, and manslaughter.

1:07:56.405 --> 1:07:58.541
-I'm not like him. -No one's saying you are.

1:07:58.607 --> 1:08:02.044
But it must've been challenging, being only 16,

1:08:02.111 --> 1:08:04.680
when your father killed that shop owner

1:08:04.747 --> 1:08:06.482
in that botched robbery.

1:08:08.551 --> 1:08:11.720
That was really difficult, wasn't it?

1:08:14.757 --> 1:08:17.393
I get it. My dad was a loser, too.

1:08:17.460 --> 1:08:20.429
A lifetime of watching him struggle, gambling,

1:08:20.496 --> 1:08:24.500
addiction, stealing to keep it all going..

1:08:24.567 --> 1:08:26.268
Only, he'd immediately lose everything

1:08:26.335 --> 1:08:28.704
and start the cycle over.

1:08:28.771 --> 1:08:32.575
Watching all that, it's not easy.

1:08:32.641 --> 1:08:35.711
No wonder you wanted to reinvent yourself.

1:08:35.778 --> 1:08:37.813
I'm not like him.

1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:41.283
And I really wanna believe you. I really do, Sadie.

1:08:42.284 --> 1:08:44.320
But there's somethin' else.

1:08:44.386 --> 1:08:45.654
Do you know Owen Hunt?

1:08:45.721 --> 1:08:48.657
[intense music]

1:08:50.826 --> 1:08:53.262
I'll take that as a yes.

1:08:53.329 --> 1:08:55.965
We have a murder linked to Mr. Hunt's home.

1:08:56.031 --> 1:08:58.934
Thing is, he said he was out of town at the time.

1:09:00.136 --> 1:09:02.872
Who besides you had access?

1:09:02.938 --> 1:09:05.908
I didn't do any of this.

1:09:05.975 --> 1:09:09.345
I didn't hurt my cousin. I would never do that.

1:09:09.411 --> 1:09:12.148
-What about Justin Caruso? -[door opens]

1:09:12.214 --> 1:09:14.283
[footsteps approaching]

1:09:14.350 --> 1:09:15.951
I'll take it from here.

1:09:19.155 --> 1:09:22.291
[instrumental music]

1:09:34.136 --> 1:09:35.905
[man] All right. Let's go.

1:09:37.406 --> 1:09:39.275
[telephone ringing]

1:09:52.555 --> 1:09:53.789
Thanks.

1:09:58.561 --> 1:10:00.629
[door buzzer buzzing]

1:10:02.898 --> 1:10:04.333
Right this way.

1:10:05.801 --> 1:10:06.802
[door shuts]

1:10:13.509 --> 1:10:15.778
-[lock clicking] -[door opens]

1:10:23.953 --> 1:10:26.121
[dramatic music]

1:10:26.188 --> 1:10:27.590
Hey, hon.

1:10:28.591 --> 1:10:30.960
You don't look so good. Get in.

1:10:35.264 --> 1:10:36.599
[cell phone chimes]

1:10:41.870 --> 1:10:43.539
Son of a bitch.

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:48.811
-You're wearing my dress? -You loaned it to me.

1:10:48.877 --> 1:10:50.646
Looks great, right?

1:10:50.713 --> 1:10:52.648
-[seatbelt clicking] -What?

1:10:52.715 --> 1:10:54.683
You didn't just expect me to lay around the house.

1:10:54.750 --> 1:10:56.952
-I was out when you called me. -What the hell?

1:10:57.019 --> 1:10:59.922
You attack my cousin and then go out partying?

1:10:59.989 --> 1:11:01.991
You almost killed her.

1:11:03.459 --> 1:11:05.361
And there's still time.

1:11:06.462 --> 1:11:08.864
[laughs] Kidding. Geez.

1:11:08.931 --> 1:11:11.267
You know, we really need to work on your gratitude

1:11:11.333 --> 1:11:13.569
'cause I've got a great plan for us.

1:11:13.636 --> 1:11:16.972
I've been building a little nest egg. Well, big egg.

1:11:17.039 --> 1:11:21.410
Been siphoning off daddy's laundry for, well, forever.

1:11:21.477 --> 1:11:25.681
And now it's time for us to set up somewhere new.

1:11:25.748 --> 1:11:28.584
Just have one more little thing to do before we can leave town.

1:11:52.141 --> 1:11:53.142
Jessica, I'm not going in there.

1:11:53.208 --> 1:11:54.643
Don't be silly.

1:11:59.381 --> 1:12:01.083
Jessica, what are we doing?

1:12:01.150 --> 1:12:02.685
Don't worry.

1:12:06.989 --> 1:12:08.023
Oh.

1:12:11.860 --> 1:12:13.295
[device beeps]

1:12:13.362 --> 1:12:15.030
How do you know the code?

1:12:20.836 --> 1:12:22.338
-Jessica. -I told you.

1:12:22.404 --> 1:12:23.572
There's one more person we need

1:12:23.639 --> 1:12:25.808
to take care of before we go.

1:12:30.612 --> 1:12:32.948
Sadie, Owen. Owen, Sadie.

1:12:33.015 --> 1:12:35.818
-[Owen grunts] -Oh, that's right.

1:12:35.884 --> 1:12:38.587
You two already know each other.

1:12:38.654 --> 1:12:40.656
But neither of you thought to loop me in.

1:12:40.723 --> 1:12:42.057
Jessica, what the hell is going on?

1:12:42.124 --> 1:12:45.194
Oof! So much anger. Can't you lighten up?

1:12:45.260 --> 1:12:48.130
I didn't dump a $100,000 on your bail to have you yell at me.

1:12:48.197 --> 1:12:50.733
Well, maybe you made a mistake spending all that money on me.

1:12:50.799 --> 1:12:52.935
No, I don't think so.

1:12:53.001 --> 1:12:55.971
I couldn't leave my best friend locked up.

1:12:56.705 --> 1:12:58.006
And I mean that, Sadie.

1:12:58.073 --> 1:13:02.077
You are the best friend I have ever had.

1:13:02.144 --> 1:13:05.314
I thought it was time to lay everything out on the table

1:13:05.381 --> 1:13:07.616
once and for all.

1:13:10.185 --> 1:13:11.754
[gasps]

1:13:11.820 --> 1:13:13.655
You know, I really wish we had champagne,

1:13:13.722 --> 1:13:17.159
but I just never got the chance to go shopping. Tsk.

1:13:18.227 --> 1:13:19.628
[breathing heavily]

1:13:19.695 --> 1:13:21.597
Hope you like bourbon.

1:13:22.731 --> 1:13:25.868
[breathing heavily]

1:13:29.204 --> 1:13:32.174
Gee, I really owe you an apology, Sadie.

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:34.109
The only reason I sought you out in the first place

1:13:34.176 --> 1:13:35.978
was 'cause of this one.

1:13:36.044 --> 1:13:39.148
See, we have a little bit of a history here.

1:13:39.214 --> 1:13:42.384
Not only were we an item for several years,

1:13:42.451 --> 1:13:44.720
but Owen here works for my father.

1:13:46.555 --> 1:13:49.224
He's very upset with you, by the way,

1:13:49.291 --> 1:13:53.095
gettin' the cops involved in all this Justin Caruso business.

1:13:53.162 --> 1:13:57.099
But, hey, he won't be a problem much longer. Hm.

1:13:58.901 --> 1:13:59.868
Mm.

1:13:59.935 --> 1:14:03.472
Anyway, this one decided to dump me.

1:14:03.539 --> 1:14:05.808
But I forgave him.

1:14:05.874 --> 1:14:09.711
We were gonna get back together until you showed up.

1:14:11.013 --> 1:14:12.781
So I had to get a glimpse of the woman he thought

1:14:12.848 --> 1:14:14.850
was better than me.

1:14:14.917 --> 1:14:19.488
I mean, come on, part of it was this dress. Right?

1:14:19.555 --> 1:14:21.890
I do think it's too good, though, for someone who slinks

1:14:21.957 --> 1:14:24.026
into work wearing it the morning after.

1:14:24.092 --> 1:14:27.029
As your friend, I have to be honest about things like that.

1:14:27.095 --> 1:14:29.598
[dramatic music]

1:14:29.665 --> 1:14:31.500
I wanted to hate you.

1:14:31.567 --> 1:14:34.570
Such a liar and a poser.

1:14:34.636 --> 1:14:36.805
Desperate wannabe.

1:14:36.872 --> 1:14:38.941
The truth is, you fit in.

1:14:39.007 --> 1:14:41.910
Oh, and then she saved me from this jerkoff in the club.

1:14:41.977 --> 1:14:44.713
Hm. One of daddy's clients.

1:14:44.780 --> 1:14:47.950
It was just so sweet, and I had the perfect opportunity

1:14:48.016 --> 1:14:50.319
to repay the gesture the night that we partied here.

1:14:50.385 --> 1:14:52.020
You lying piece of crap.

1:14:52.087 --> 1:14:55.290
-You framed me. -You're calling me the liar?

1:14:55.357 --> 1:14:57.826
You're the one who invited us back to your house,

1:14:57.893 --> 1:15:01.430
but conveniently didn't mention that it wasn't your place.

1:15:01.497 --> 1:15:04.233
You did that all on your own, sweetie.

1:15:04.299 --> 1:15:05.534
You're a monster.

1:15:05.601 --> 1:15:06.935
I didn't do anything you didn't do, Sadie.

1:15:07.002 --> 1:15:09.972
-But you did. -We both omitted certain truths.

1:15:10.038 --> 1:15:13.775
You-you know, frankly, I think you are the bigger fraud here.

1:15:13.842 --> 1:15:17.012
-At least I know who I am. -A killer?

1:15:17.079 --> 1:15:20.816
Anyone can be a killer, Sadie. Not everyone gets away with it.

1:15:22.017 --> 1:15:24.720
You know what? Here's to you, Sadie.

1:15:24.786 --> 1:15:27.055
Welcome to the club.

1:15:27.122 --> 1:15:30.025
-What club? -[Owen grunts]

1:15:30.092 --> 1:15:33.061
The club of getting away with murder.

1:15:33.128 --> 1:15:36.598
You wanted to be a part of the elite, well, here's how.

1:15:36.665 --> 1:15:39.067
Now you get to show your gratitude.

1:15:40.369 --> 1:15:41.670
I bailed you out, and soon

1:15:41.737 --> 1:15:43.906
I will be getting you out of the country.

1:15:43.972 --> 1:15:47.643
So, to show me your thanks,

1:15:47.709 --> 1:15:49.645
you got to kill this one. Click, click.

1:15:49.711 --> 1:15:51.947
[breathing heavily]

1:15:52.014 --> 1:15:55.450
You know, to show me what a true friend you really are.

1:15:55.517 --> 1:15:58.887
Here's the thing, my daddy's gonna kill him if you don't,

1:15:58.954 --> 1:16:02.758
so it's gonna happen either way. Go ahead.

1:16:02.824 --> 1:16:05.594
[intense music]

1:16:06.795 --> 1:16:09.097
Now, you can decide not to kill him,

1:16:09.164 --> 1:16:12.000
but then I'm gonna have to kill you both.

1:16:12.067 --> 1:16:14.503
-Okay? -[grunting]

1:16:14.570 --> 1:16:16.638
[Jessica] Think of it this way.

1:16:16.705 --> 1:16:21.109
Just one little thing for me, and you're in the club forever.

1:16:22.611 --> 1:16:24.613
Isn't that what you want, Sadie?

1:16:26.281 --> 1:16:28.850
Now, make it quick. We have a plane to catch.

1:16:29.818 --> 1:16:30.986
[Owen grunts]

1:16:36.425 --> 1:16:37.392
[Owen grunts]

1:16:37.459 --> 1:16:39.628
I really had fun with you, Owen.

1:16:41.964 --> 1:16:43.532
But I have to go with Jessica.

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:45.667
[Owen grunts]

1:16:47.402 --> 1:16:50.339
Remember what I said about Romeo and Juliet?

1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:55.243
There was never a way for them to have their happy ending.

1:16:55.310 --> 1:16:57.245
[breathing heavily]

1:16:57.312 --> 1:17:00.015
-[dramatic music] -[Owen groaning]

1:17:00.082 --> 1:17:04.052
[chuckles] Oh, my God. You actually did it.

1:17:04.119 --> 1:17:05.687
[siren blaring]

1:17:05.754 --> 1:17:07.556
-Run! -[knife clatters]

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:10.759
[dramatic music]

1:17:12.828 --> 1:17:15.764
[siren blaring]

1:17:15.831 --> 1:17:18.333
Someone's coming. Let's go through the garage.

1:17:19.668 --> 1:17:22.304
[siren blaring]

1:17:24.106 --> 1:17:25.073
Go.

1:17:29.311 --> 1:17:30.379
It's over, Davis.

1:17:30.445 --> 1:17:34.282
-Put your hands up. -Shoot her, Sadie.

1:17:34.349 --> 1:17:36.585
-You're under arrest. -No, no. I didn't do anything.

1:17:36.652 --> 1:17:40.489
She's the one who killed Owen, not me. I'm innocent.

1:17:40.555 --> 1:17:43.659
You traitorous, lying piece of trash! How could you?

1:17:43.725 --> 1:17:46.928
Like you said, I'm a liar and a poser,

1:17:46.995 --> 1:17:49.231
and really good at it.

1:17:49.297 --> 1:17:52.234
[instrumental music]

1:18:09.017 --> 1:18:11.653
-I'm sorry. -I'll live.

1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:13.055
But up until you said that bit about

1:18:13.121 --> 1:18:16.124
Romeo and Juliet, I wasn't sure.

1:18:16.191 --> 1:18:18.060
I told you, all they had to do was

1:18:18.126 --> 1:18:20.328
tell each other about the playing dead.

1:18:20.395 --> 1:18:24.666
[chuckles] So maybe there's a chance for our happy ending?

1:18:24.733 --> 1:18:26.501
-Maybe. -[Gloria] Williams.

1:18:26.568 --> 1:18:28.170
Hm?

1:18:28.236 --> 1:18:30.839
-I-I'll be right behind you. -Yeah.

1:18:36.978 --> 1:18:38.246
[Drous] Great job, Ms. Williams.

1:18:38.313 --> 1:18:39.514
Truly impressive.

1:18:40.582 --> 1:18:42.050
Pleasure working together.

1:18:43.418 --> 1:18:45.153
[Owen] You've reached Owen Hunt, sorry I can't

1:18:45.220 --> 1:18:46.988
make this call right now.

1:18:58.734 --> 1:19:00.802
[Gloria] Now, as promised, you won't be charged with accessory

1:19:00.869 --> 1:19:02.370
in Justin's case.

1:19:03.538 --> 1:19:05.974
Thank you for helping us bring down Davis.

1:19:06.041 --> 1:19:08.376
And with a recorded confession, no less.

1:19:08.443 --> 1:19:10.078
[Drous] Sorry for the interrogation.

1:19:10.145 --> 1:19:12.080
When Gloria first mentioned that she wanted to use you

1:19:12.147 --> 1:19:14.349
as our insider, I wasn't convinced.

1:19:14.416 --> 1:19:16.718
We needed someone that Davis trusted.

1:19:16.785 --> 1:19:19.588
At the club, I watched how she connected with you.

1:19:19.654 --> 1:19:21.723
I'd never seen that before.

1:19:21.790 --> 1:19:23.225
And then you became her sidekick,

1:19:23.291 --> 1:19:26.194
something she's never had before.

1:19:26.261 --> 1:19:28.363
I knew you'd be the best way in.

1:19:28.430 --> 1:19:31.733
And now that we have Jessica, we can go after her father.

1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:32.968
Hm.

1:19:34.803 --> 1:19:37.939
[instrumental music]

1:19:41.710 --> 1:19:42.978
[doorbell ringing]

1:19:43.044 --> 1:19:45.814
You made it! Oh, my God!

1:19:47.649 --> 1:19:49.684
I told you, you didn't have to come back yet.

1:19:49.751 --> 1:19:51.787
Mm, I've been away long enough.

1:19:51.853 --> 1:19:54.055
Doctor says I'm cleared for light duty.

1:19:56.758 --> 1:19:58.226
Okay.

1:19:58.293 --> 1:20:00.128
I'm sorry about what happened.

1:20:00.195 --> 1:20:02.397
I really tried to keep you out of it.

1:20:03.632 --> 1:20:05.967
I told you Jessica was bad news.

1:20:06.034 --> 1:20:08.804
I know. I know.

1:20:08.870 --> 1:20:12.107
She became my ticket to freedom, but I couldn't tell anyone.

1:20:13.241 --> 1:20:16.812
What you did was extremely dangerous

1:20:16.878 --> 1:20:19.381
and very impressive.

1:20:19.447 --> 1:20:21.850
-Thank you. -[Briana] And Owen?

1:20:21.917 --> 1:20:25.687
He's recovering. Dad taught me a lot about non-fatal wounds.

1:20:25.754 --> 1:20:28.690
I guess not everything I learned from him was completely useless.

1:20:28.757 --> 1:20:30.692
[chuckles]

1:20:30.759 --> 1:20:33.895
I'm sorry about those things I said about him.

1:20:33.962 --> 1:20:35.897
-And you. -It's okay.

1:20:35.964 --> 1:20:38.667
I'm sorry I ruined the Mutiyago dress and had to lie about it.

1:20:38.733 --> 1:20:41.269
[chuckles] Yeah. You owe me.

1:20:42.003 --> 1:20:43.171
I do.

1:20:57.219 --> 1:21:00.021
-How did you-- -I told you I'd cover it.

1:21:01.289 --> 1:21:04.326
Besides, someone with some extra cash to spare

1:21:04.392 --> 1:21:06.394
wanted to thank me for saving his life.

1:21:06.461 --> 1:21:08.997
Well, for not actually killing him.

1:21:09.064 --> 1:21:11.366
So I called in a favor.

1:21:11.433 --> 1:21:13.134
I appreciate it.

1:21:13.201 --> 1:21:15.604
-But you're still fired. -Probably for the best.

1:21:17.973 --> 1:21:19.441
So what now?

1:21:20.442 --> 1:21:22.210
I don't know.

1:21:22.277 --> 1:21:25.714
Gloria asked if I ever considered police work.

1:21:25.780 --> 1:21:26.948
Uh-uh.

1:21:29.317 --> 1:21:32.087
I guess I still have some things to figure out.
