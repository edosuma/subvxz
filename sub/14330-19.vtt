17:55.140 --> 17:55.908
- I HAVE A CRAZY MIDDLE-AGED SON

17:55.974 --> 17:58.577
WITH A STUPID INTERNET SHOW.

17:58.644 --> 18:01.413
HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING?

18:01.480 --> 18:06.452
- I'M GONNA SMEAR YOU WITH MEAT
AND PUT A LEOPARD IN YOUR ROOM!

18:06.518 --> 18:08.554
ANYWAY, I'M ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR MORE FOOTAGE,

18:08.620 --> 18:10.222
SO IF ANYONE SEES A MONSTER,

18:10.289 --> 18:12.024
AND BY ANYONE,
I MEAN TURNER'S DAD,

18:12.090 --> 18:13.025
GIVE ME A CALL.

18:13.091 --> 18:14.092
[toilet flushes]

18:14.159 --> 18:16.195
- YAY, ANOTHER MONSTER!

18:16.261 --> 18:17.563
WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT?

18:17.629 --> 18:19.264
[cell phone ringing]

18:19.331 --> 18:20.432
- RUN, MOTHER!

18:20.499 --> 18:22.534
THERE'S A GIANT CRICKET
IN THE ROOM!

18:22.601 --> 18:24.236
- THAT'S THE PHONE, DENZEL.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.237
- WEIRD.

18:25.304 --> 18:28.340
YOU'RE LIVE ON <i> CROCK TALK.</i>

18:28.407 --> 18:29.641
- MR. CROCK TALK,

18:29.708 --> 18:31.577
WHY ARE THERE
SO MANY MONSTERS IN MY HOUSE,

18:31.643 --> 18:33.111
AND WHY DO THEY ALL WANT
MY BALONEY?

18:33.178 --> 18:35.314
- MY HEAD ROLLED A STRIKE
AT THE BEEF AND BOWL.

18:35.380 --> 18:36.181
I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

18:36.248 --> 18:40.519
I'VE GOT FAIRIES TO FILM.

18:40.586 --> 18:41.854
TURNER'S STILL NOT HERE.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.755
THAT EXPLAINS WHY
HE NEVER TURNS IN HIS HOMEWORK.

18:43.822 --> 18:45.524
NO PROBLEM.

18:45.591 --> 18:46.725
I'LL HIDE IN HIS CLOSET

18:46.792 --> 18:49.761
TILL HE COMES BACK
WITH HIS FAIRIES!

18:49.828 --> 18:51.196
[growling]

18:51.263 --> 18:53.665
[yelling and smacking]

18:53.732 --> 18:55.400
PUNCTURE WOUND!
THAT'LL BE INFECTED!

18:55.467 --> 18:57.135
GAH!

18:57.202 --> 18:58.937
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

18:59.004 --> 19:02.774
- WELL, BACK TO THE LANES WITH
MY NEW SCREAMING BOWLING BALL.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.044
- MOTHER, I HAD
A TERRIBLE EVENING.

19:06.111 --> 19:08.447
DESPITE BOWLING
THE EVER-TRICKY 7-10 SPLIT,

19:08.514 --> 19:10.182
I DIDN'T GET THE FAIRY FOOTAGE.

19:10.249 --> 19:11.116
I STILL FEEL LIKE A FAILURE.

19:11.183 --> 19:14.152
- WELL, I HAD A SWELL EVENING.

19:14.219 --> 19:17.523
I'M MARRYING OLAF
AND TAKING HIM TO NIAGARA FALLS

19:17.589 --> 19:18.857
AGAINST HIS WILL.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.627
- THERE'S NEVER A SWAT TEAM
WHEN YOU NEED ONE.

19:21.693 --> 19:22.928
[cell phone ringing]

19:22.995 --> 19:25.998
- DON'T WORRY!
I KNOW IT'S THE PHONE THIS TIME.

19:26.064 --> 19:26.865
HELLO?
GAH!

19:26.932 --> 19:31.270
SOMEONE PUT COFFEE IN THE PHONE!

19:31.336 --> 19:32.170
HELLO?

19:32.237 --> 19:33.972
- THIS IS DOUG DIMMADOME.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.374
- DOUG DIMMADOME?

19:35.440 --> 19:37.509
- DOUG DIMMADOME,
ON MY DIMMAPHONE.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.244
SON, YOUR WEBCAST
IS THE BIGGEST THING

19:39.311 --> 19:40.679
TO HIT THE INTERNET

19:40.746 --> 19:42.648
SINCE THE SHOW ABOUT
THE MISSING SWEDISH PROFESSOR.

19:42.714 --> 19:43.815
PEOPLE LOVE WATCHING YOU

19:43.882 --> 19:45.651
GET THE STUFFING
BEAT OUT OF YOU BY MONSTERS

19:45.717 --> 19:49.688

19:49.755 --> 19:54.026
BOTTOM LINE, I WANT TO BUY
<i>CROCK TALK</i> FOR $10 MILLION.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.027

19:55.093 --> 19:58.397
AAUGH!

YOU'RE KIDDING!

19:59.031 --> 20:01.333
[knocking]

20:01.400 --> 20:02.534
- I'M NOT KIDDING.

I'M A BIG FAN
WITH A BIG CONTRACT.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.638

20:09.107 --> 20:10.642
TO BEAT YOU SENSELESS.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.477
- YOU GOT IT, FREAKY COWBOY!

20:12.544 --> 20:13.946
- HONESTLY, DENZEL,

20:14.012 --> 20:17.349
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET A
MONSTER ON THAT SHOW EVERY WEEK?

20:17.416 --> 20:18.584
YOU'LL NEVER PULL IT OFF.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.352
- OH, BALONEY, MOTHER.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.020
- DON'T TAKE THAT TONE WITH ME.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.623
- NO, I MEAN I'M GOING
TO USE BALONEY.

20:24.690 --> 20:25.624
APPARENTLY, MONSTERS JUST LOVE
THIS STUFF.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.560
I'M GONNA BE A STAR!

20:28.627 --> 20:30.963
BY THE WAY,
I'M NOT CALLING YOU DADDY.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.433
- LIVE FROM DOWNTOWN DIMMSDALE,

20:34.499 --> 20:36.802
IT'S <i> CROCK TALK.</i>

20:41.239 --> 20:43.976
[cheers and applause]

20:48.513 --> 20:49.681
- WELCOME, EVERYONE.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.351
WHO WANTS TO SEE
SOME MONSTERS BEAT ME SILLY?

20:52.417 --> 20:54.953
- I LOVE YOU, MR. CROCK TALK!

20:55.020 --> 20:56.955
- NOW, JUST LET ME SLIP
INTO MY BALONEY JUMPSUIT.

20:57.022 --> 21:00.392
OKAY, MONSTERS,
WHO WANTS A PIECE OF ME?

21:00.459 --> 21:02.894
[growling and crashing]

21:04.296 --> 21:06.098
OOH, THAT AREA'S OFF-LIMITS!

21:06.164 --> 21:08.900
GAH! OOH! EEH!

21:08.967 --> 21:11.737
EGAH!

21:11.803 --> 21:13.772
I LOVE SHOW BUSINESS!

21:13.839 --> 21:15.641
- THERE ARE YOUR MONSTERS,
SPORT,

21:15.707 --> 21:16.708
AND THEY'RE BEATING UP
MR. CROCKER.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.944
MAYBE WE SHOULD POOF THEM AWAY.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.513
- JUST GIVE HIM
A FEW MORE SECONDS.

21:21.580 --> 21:26.418
- WATCH THE COLD CUTS!

21:26.485 --> 21:28.587
[yelling]

21:28.654 --> 21:29.755
HELP!
STOP!

21:29.821 --> 21:31.723
I BLAME MOTHER!

21:33.992 --> 21:35.193
[yelling]

21:35.260 --> 21:39.464
- AH, TIMMY, I THINK
MR. CROCKER'S HAD ENOUGH.

21:39.531 --> 21:40.666
- AH, OKAY.

21:40.732 --> 21:43.568
I'LL GIVE HIM A BREAK.

21:43.635 --> 21:44.903
poof!

21:44.970 --> 21:46.171
- MY MONSTERS ARE GONE!

21:46.238 --> 21:46.738
[booing]

21:46.805 --> 21:48.807
- [sobbing]

21:48.874 --> 21:50.242
- YOU'RE CANCELED, SON.

21:50.308 --> 21:51.209
NO MONSTERS MEANS NO SHOW,

21:51.276 --> 21:54.980
AND NO SHOW MEANS
NO $10 MILLION.

21:55.047 --> 21:55.981
- NO!

21:56.048 --> 21:57.649
[booing]

21:57.716 --> 22:00.452
- SON, LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE DIMMA-DONE.

22:00.519 --> 22:01.453
- WAIT!

22:01.520 --> 22:03.021
HUP, OW!

22:03.088 --> 22:07.626
MAN, I WISH THIS PLACE
WAS CARPETED.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.227
THE MONSTERS WERE NEVER SEEN
IN DIMMSDALE AGAIN.

22:09.294 --> 22:12.431
HOWEVER, TIMMY TURNER
STILL PLAYS A WEEKLY CARD GAME

22:12.497 --> 22:13.999
WITH THE SWAMP CREATURE.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.034
MOTHER AND PROFESSOR GUNDERSSON
HONEYMOONED AT NIAGARA FALLS

22:16.101 --> 22:18.336
BEFORE HE WAS RESCUED
BY A SWEDISH SWAT TEAM.

22:18.403 --> 22:22.140
TIMMY'S DAD WISELY GAVE UP
EATING BALONEY SANDWICHES

22:22.207 --> 22:23.275
IN FAVOR OF SALAMI,

22:23.341 --> 22:25.043
UNAWARE THAT
THIS IS THE LUNCH MEAT OF CHOICE

22:25.110 --> 22:26.111
FOR WEREWOLVES.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.046
TIMMY'S MOM
AND MR. CROCKER'S HEAD

22:28.113 --> 22:30.248
WON FIRST PLACE AT THE NATIONAL
BOWLING CHAMPIONSHIP,

22:30.315 --> 22:32.484
AND THUS ENDS ANOTHER EPISODE
