11:49.041 --> 11:51.585
there's not a whole lot

Tony has the worst tattoo.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.787
He does not have the artistry

33:59.871 --> 34:01.664
to pull off
black-and-gray photo-realism.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.584
- None of the spots
are correct,

34:04.667 --> 34:06.169
especially on the top
of the head.

34:06.252 --> 34:07.712
It's not even close.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.714

of the muzzle.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.299
He loses the shape
of the cheeks.

34:12.382 --> 34:15.052
of the forehead area
in his tattoo

34:15.136 --> 34:16.971
than they would be coming off
the back of his head.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.514
- Undeniably, it's a leopard.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.308
But once you put that picture
right beside it,

34:20.391 --> 34:21.809
it loses all value.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.813

34:26.898 --> 34:28.649
- The details in the eyes
are really nice,

34:28.733 --> 34:31.860
but the fact that the brow
has no black

34:31.944 --> 34:33.571
that falls over top
of the eyes,

34:33.654 --> 34:35.156
it makes the eyes look
like they bulge out.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.992
- The killer for me
is the mane, man.

34:38.076 --> 34:42.246
The application on that mane
is atrocious.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.498

34:43.581 --> 34:45.958
- I think you have better
application than Tiffer.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.251

is better

34:47.335 --> 34:48.835
than either one of theirs.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.588
- The detail on your eyes
are way better.

34:50.670 --> 34:51.714
Your ears are way better.

34:52.965 --> 34:55.134

of the nose itself.

Team Christian played it smart

35:09.607 --> 35:12.693
by giving the toughest tattoos
to the opposing team.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.403
- But Amanda got to choose
her own tattoo,

35:14.487 --> 35:16.155
and she falls pretty short.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.949
- The fox has a very
diamond-shaped face.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.493
The fur comes outwards.
That part's a mess.

35:20.576 --> 35:23.412
This leads itself
to definitely being a raccoon

35:23.496 --> 35:25.373

35:25.456 --> 35:27.333

the same animal,

35:27.416 --> 35:28.543

that falls short

35:29.669 --> 35:30.837
in those areas is Tony's.

- The fact that it's a portrait
of an animal,

'cause it's very recognizable

35:33.798 --> 35:36.008

35:44.433 --> 35:46.435
Very legible as being a lion,

35:46.519 --> 35:47.770
you've gotta do is keep
the tones of the face

35:47.854 --> 35:49.939
