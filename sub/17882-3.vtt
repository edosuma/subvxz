WEBVTT

00:01.842 --> 00:02.875
So let me get this straight...

00:02.996 --> 00:05.406
You can hack into the FBI mainframe

00:05.409 --> 00:07.558
and put the hamburglar
on the most wanted list,

00:07.694 --> 00:08.680
but you...

00:08.681 --> 00:09.764
But I managed to lock my keys in my car.

00:09.765 --> 00:10.744
Yes, we've established that.

00:11.091 --> 00:13.495
Can you stop making fun of
me and help me break in?

00:13.640 --> 00:15.391
Why don't I just teach you?

00:15.392 --> 00:17.250
I don't need...
A-actually,

00:17.251 --> 00:18.896
it's a good idea to learn new things.

00:28.730 --> 00:31.300
You think you're so cool, don't you?

00:31.301 --> 00:33.290
Yeah, I do.

00:33.291 --> 00:34.282
You're pretty cool.

00:34.283 --> 00:34.944
Melon ball!

00:37.118 --> 00:37.876
Hey!

00:37.978 --> 00:38.893
Hi, baby!

00:39.102 --> 00:40.745
You left your celly in my ride.

00:41.007 --> 00:43.175
Mm. How am I supposed to
text you my love haikus?

00:43.201 --> 00:45.902
Hey, there he is. My girl's asexual bestie.

00:45.914 --> 00:48.266
Totally nonthreatening. I love this guy.

00:48.873 --> 00:50.455
What's with the suit?

00:50.456 --> 00:52.188
Well, Dutch got a new job at a nonprofit.

00:52.394 --> 00:56.078
Yeah, we, uh, we build wells in
countries ravaged by poverty.

00:56.150 --> 00:57.787
And the most fulfilling part...

00:58.123 --> 01:00.154
I get crazy paid!

01:00.316 --> 01:02.108
Dollar dollar bills, y'all!

01:02.109 --> 01:03.225
Yeah.

01:04.382 --> 01:06.270
Hey, a hybrid?

01:06.376 --> 01:08.337
What happened to your gas guzzler?

01:08.578 --> 01:09.893
Going green, Broheim.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.934
Yeah, I saw this intense movie

01:11.935 --> 01:13.379
about how we're killing our planet.

01:13.380 --> 01:14.973
"An Inconvenient Truth"?

01:14.994 --> 01:17.039
"Water World."

01:17.040 --> 01:19.235
Yeah, the great Kevin Costner
plays this fish dude.

01:19.244 --> 01:22.173
Really opened my eyes. So...
I bought this puppy.

01:22.367 --> 01:24.370
Then I ripped out all that electric crap,

01:25.048 --> 01:26.989
dropped in an ass-ton of ponies.

01:27.541 --> 01:30.652
Well, I gotta Michael Bolton. Giddyap!

01:34.624 --> 01:35.937
Isn't he the best?

01:36.495 --> 01:38.871
That guy is the worst!
What does she see in him?

01:38.872 --> 01:41.885
I mean... when it comes to
romance, the man is a God.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.687
You should see the epic stunts he pulls.

01:43.970 --> 01:47.408
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you made us our own muppets!

01:47.409 --> 01:49.100
Yep, only took me six
months to hand-stitch.

01:49.875 --> 01:50.958
Check it! Oh!

01:51.993 --> 01:53.365
Now let's party!

01:53.366 --> 01:54.436
Whoo!

01:55.799 --> 01:57.478
Just no way to compete with that.

01:57.706 --> 01:59.912
Listen, love is a numbers game, okay?

01:59.913 --> 02:01.708
I'm with Melanie ten hours a day.

02:01.972 --> 02:04.176
Dutch gets the rest of
her time, but she needs

02:04.177 --> 02:07.025
eight hours of sleep, plus time
for showering, working out,

02:07.026 --> 02:08.506
miscellaneous body maintenance.

02:08.535 --> 02:10.689
That means Dutch only gets to
see her 3.8 hours a day tops.

02:10.690 --> 02:14.307
Yeah, but don't they spend most
of that time going to pound town?

02:14.370 --> 02:15.809
Hey, we on for hoagies today?

02:15.963 --> 02:18.013
It's a date. Numbers game!

02:18.014 --> 02:19.104
Pound town!

02:19.516 --> 02:23.008
Paper jam on tray nine?
Where are the first eight trays?

02:23.009 --> 02:24.489
Just call the tech, and he'll fix it.

02:24.490 --> 02:27.090
No need, baby. Gadget man is right here.

02:27.091 --> 02:29.071
No. Oz specifically told you not to.

02:29.072 --> 02:31.682
Every time you try and fix
something, you go way too far.

02:35.984 --> 02:39.215
Dude, my stuff.
What did we discuss about the pranks?

02:39.216 --> 02:41.692
Wasn't me.
They even took your ergonomic chair.

02:43.592 --> 02:45.068
It's from Oz?

02:45.295 --> 02:47.105
I've been moved to the I.T. annex?

02:47.532 --> 02:50.036
Ugh. God, those guys are creepos.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.373
Oz, we gotta talk.

02:54.649 --> 02:56.372
Hey, there's my guy.

02:56.949 --> 02:58.073
How's your morning going?

02:58.088 --> 02:59.989
Not well. I just came from the I.T. annex,

02:59.990 --> 03:01.290
where you moved my desk.

03:01.398 --> 03:03.069
I don't want to be in there
with the computer monkeys.

03:03.070 --> 03:04.851
But you are a computer monkey.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.124
Not like them!

03:06.281 --> 03:08.901
I like your face. You have a sister?

03:09.654 --> 03:10.731
No.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.709
How about a wig?

03:12.969 --> 03:15.537
I believe that your skills are
best served behind a desk,

03:15.538 --> 03:16.796
not out in the field.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.164
What?! I do great out there.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.843
This is ridiculous, and you know it!

03:19.844 --> 03:21.743
What's ridiculous is you
spending all your time

03:21.744 --> 03:24.175
focused on your little
numbers game with Melanie.

03:24.176 --> 03:25.792
How did you... that's not...

03:26.271 --> 03:27.785
It doesn't matter. I'm still focused.

03:28.017 --> 03:29.692
I always do whatever it takes.

03:29.693 --> 03:31.517
Really? Remember Cash's shoulder?

03:31.798 --> 03:33.756
It dislocates all the time.
Just pop it back in.

03:34.293 --> 03:35.348
Come on. Pop it back in!

03:35.534 --> 03:38.411
Okay. Oh, it's like a wet noodle. Oh!

03:38.992 --> 03:40.289
That's just a bad example.

03:40.297 --> 03:42.016
Come on, you know I
always do what it takes.

03:42.017 --> 03:43.740
Let's put this theory to the test.

03:44.048 --> 03:46.051
Tase yourself in the face.

03:46.388 --> 03:46.875
What?

03:46.876 --> 03:48.815
Come on. You said you're willing
to do whatever it takes.

03:49.048 --> 03:52.337
It's for the job. Prove it.
Put some fuzz on those kiwis.

03:52.497 --> 03:53.623
Okay, they're... they're plenty fuzzy,

03:53.624 --> 03:56.094
and what does that have to do
with me getting my job done?

03:56.095 --> 03:58.068
I'm hearing a lot of yap yap
and not a lot of zap zap!

03:58.332 --> 04:00.753
That's crazy. Nobody would do that.

04:01.105 --> 04:03.167
Josh, tase yourself in the face.
It's for work.

04:03.168 --> 04:05.379
Roger that.

04:06.901 --> 04:09.417
Now there's a guy who gets things done.

04:09.868 --> 04:12.066
Now if you don't mind, my
2:00 appointment is here.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.696
You just scoot along
back to your nerd cave.

04:13.705 --> 04:15.044
Wait. Wait. Wait. Is it a new client?

04:15.045 --> 04:16.291
I'll do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.473
I swear, I'll crush it.

04:17.761 --> 04:20.575
Let's see what you're made of, champ.
Client's waiting.

04:24.363 --> 04:26.904
Hey, I'm Cameron.
I'll be handling your job.

04:26.922 --> 04:28.347
Hey, man. Jimmie. Nice to meet you.

04:28.348 --> 04:30.306
Nice to meet you, too.
So, uh, what do you do?

04:30.307 --> 04:32.985
I'm a driver. Oh, you're the limo driver.

04:32.986 --> 04:34.450
I'm sorry. I-I thought you were the client.

04:35.087 --> 04:36.838
Prom's coming up. Busy time for you,

04:37.462 --> 04:39.987
huh? So, um, how much do
you know about NASCAR?

04:39.988 --> 04:41.824
You mean the one where the
guys with the mullets

04:41.825 --> 04:43.859
drive around in a circle
and call it a sport?

04:44.738 --> 04:45.535
Not a fan.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.482
Why do you ask?

04:47.520 --> 04:49.776
Holy balls!

04:49.786 --> 04:52.176
Ho ho ho ho!

04:52.428 --> 04:54.643
NASCAR superstar Jimmie Johnson!

04:54.820 --> 04:57.532
Number 48 in the flesh! Oh!

04:57.533 --> 04:59.565
It's Superman.
I can't believe this is happening.

04:59.566 --> 05:03.435
Yeah, I can't either.
This is crazy. Racecars!

05:03.442 --> 05:05.415
Get 'er done!

05:07.251 --> 05:09.004
Hey, man, we're testing out at
auto club speedway this week.

05:09.005 --> 05:10.760
You're clearly a fan.

05:10.761 --> 05:12.512
Why don't you come out and,
you know, see what we do?

05:12.522 --> 05:15.064
Oh! I'm more than a fan, man.

05:15.135 --> 05:16.380
You're my second favorite
human on the planet

05:16.416 --> 05:18.429
right after the guy who invented boobs!

05:18.712 --> 05:20.719
Classy. Dutch, why are you here?

05:20.730 --> 05:22.681
Double J., looking good.

05:22.682 --> 05:25.670
How are you, bro?
Good to see you, O-Dog. Whoo!

05:26.627 --> 05:28.126
It's quite a crew you got here.

05:28.142 --> 05:29.436
Yeah, they're an eclectic bunch.

05:29.437 --> 05:30.833
I don't know what he's doing here.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.184
Oh. Oh, actually, I-I don't work here.

05:32.185 --> 05:34.014
See, I got a sweet new job at a nonprofit.

05:34.015 --> 05:34.825
We build wells.

05:34.929 --> 05:35.699
Yeah, he's a saint.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.322
Mr. Johnson, whatever you
need, no matter big or small,

05:38.323 --> 05:39.635
I will get 'er done.

05:40.302 --> 05:41.579
No one says that.

05:42.441 --> 05:43.921
Very excited to work with you, sir.

05:43.997 --> 05:45.193
Come on, Jimmie. I'll show you my office.

05:45.194 --> 05:46.694
Is it weird I got a boner?

05:46.695 --> 05:56.223

06:08.772 --> 06:11.207
Our newest client... one Jimmie Johnson,

06:11.358 --> 06:12.560
best known for being... being

06:12.561 --> 06:15.027
5-time consecutive NASCAR
Sprint Cup champion

06:15.028 --> 06:18.390
and the Associated Press'
Athlete of the Year 2009.

06:18.455 --> 06:21.267
Looky here. Someone figured
out how to type "NASCAR"

06:21.268 --> 06:23.088
into their little computer machine-y.

06:23.089 --> 06:24.167
Just doing what it takes to win.

06:24.189 --> 06:28.338
Fun fact... NASCAR's largest
growing fan demographic... Latinos.

06:28.339 --> 06:30.511
Another fun fact...
Shutty.

06:30.512 --> 06:32.672
Mm. Now all NASCAR communication
between the driver

06:32.673 --> 06:34.679
and the crew chief is on a secure channel.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.295
Look what happened on lap 37.
27 coming up on your side.

06:40.353 --> 06:43.883
Mid-race, Jimmie's comm channel
was taken over by that music.

06:43.915 --> 06:45.991
Jimmie had to finish second place.

06:46.122 --> 06:48.747
And for Jimmie, there is no second place.

06:48.783 --> 06:53.318
Now the only people with access
to radios were Jimmie's crew.

06:53.319 --> 06:55.427
So you think he's got a mole on his team?

06:55.428 --> 06:57.572
Well, at least he doesn't
have a mole on his lug nuts.

06:57.573 --> 06:59.505
Doopa, doopa, what! What!

06:59.506 --> 07:03.381
Ha ha! Come on. Gimme...that...
Self-shutty.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.883
Your job is to infiltrate the crew,

07:05.903 --> 07:07.872
set up hidden security cameras,

07:07.873 --> 07:09.323
and figure out who did this.

07:10.186 --> 07:12.343
Not a problem. 
Okay, so we've got a mole.

07:12.348 --> 07:15.329
It could be anyone, so we've
gotta stay under the radar.

07:31.512 --> 07:32.412
What?

07:32.975 --> 07:36.699
Do you have a sweatshirt
or cargo pants? Maybe...

07:37.486 --> 07:38.931
Ah, we can make it work.

07:40.816 --> 07:42.787
Does that feel good?
Right in the sweet spot.

07:42.788 --> 07:45.727
Hey. Hey. I told you to stop
fixing things around here.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.235
I know, I know, but hear me out.

07:47.514 --> 07:49.848
Look, I gave the copier
a fully robotic brain.

07:49.869 --> 07:53.383
So now it has a F.P.G.A. neural cluster
with monster computing power.

07:53.384 --> 07:54.567
Can it still make copies?

07:54.602 --> 07:56.953
It's a work in progress. I'm fixing it.

08:04.786 --> 08:06.852
Good God, is it possible?

08:08.626 --> 08:09.886
I did it.

08:10.377 --> 08:11.931
I finally did it!

08:12.359 --> 08:13.228
Yes!

08:19.365 --> 08:20.141
Okay,

08:20.366 --> 08:22.216
here are the bullet cams Cash designed.

08:22.456 --> 08:24.743
Now Dutch said we should
really try to blend in

08:24.760 --> 08:26.110
before making our first move.

08:26.376 --> 08:27.698
I appreciate Dutch's help,

08:27.699 --> 08:29.853
but I was online all night
researching NASCAR.

08:29.854 --> 08:31.083
I think I'll blend in just fine.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.138
Hey. You all right?

08:38.168 --> 08:39.745
Yeah, I-I'm sorry, man.

08:40.110 --> 08:43.769
My friend's a huge Jimmie fan.
This is a dream job for him.

08:43.784 --> 08:46.074
First day jitters. I'll go easy on you.

08:46.075 --> 08:48.700
You're on hood duty.
Tie it down for Jimmie's test session.

08:49.226 --> 08:50.358
Get 'er done.

08:50.461 --> 08:51.891
See? That is a thing.

08:52.973 --> 08:54.952
Please tell me you've
read about this online.

08:55.115 --> 08:57.433
Come on. How hard can it
be to strap on a hood?

09:04.096 --> 09:06.874
All right, Oz, just...
before you say anything,

09:06.875 --> 09:08.098
you gotta hear me out.

09:08.678 --> 09:09.759
Oz?

09:11.736 --> 09:14.384
What was that room? What room?

09:15.409 --> 09:17.329
Uh, uh, whatever. Look, I know I messed up,

09:17.330 --> 09:19.659
but let me talk to Jimmie.
I'll tell him I can fix this.

09:19.712 --> 09:21.570
No way, buckaroo. Your cover's blown.

09:21.572 --> 09:23.325
The only reason Jimmie hasn't s-canned us

09:23.326 --> 09:24.229
is 'cause we go way back.

09:24.349 --> 09:25.874
[20 years ago]

09:25.994 --> 09:26.970
Damn, Jimmie.

09:27.177 --> 09:28.759
You should be a racecar driver.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.918
Nah, I'd rather be a tap dancer.

09:31.140 --> 09:32.727
Shutty. You're a driver.

09:33.308 --> 09:35.680
Please don't banish me back
to the I.T. annex.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.027
Calm down, chicken wing. Mistakes happen.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.504
It's like the time I went
hunting with my friend.

09:40.593 --> 09:41.557
We'll call him Dick.

09:41.558 --> 09:43.941
He got super wasted and
shot a guy in the face.

09:43.942 --> 09:46.741
Now ol' Dickie wanted to cap him
again and bury him in the woods,

09:46.742 --> 09:50.329
but we did the right thing.
We let the CIA take the rap.

09:51.128 --> 09:52.548
Understand what I'm trying to say?

09:53.579 --> 09:55.134
Uh... yeah.

09:55.181 --> 09:57.629
You were with Dick Cheney
when he shot that guy?

09:58.419 --> 09:59.511
No.

10:00.445 --> 10:01.962
My point is this...

10:02.045 --> 10:05.064
We all make mistakes.
It's how we handle them that matters.

10:05.486 --> 10:08.286
You want your desk back? Handle it.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.766
I told you I'll get this done, and I will.

10:12.096 --> 10:13.713
Whatever it takes.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.158
Look, if you're here for boner pills,

10:16.226 --> 10:17.653
I don't sell those anymore.

10:18.570 --> 10:19.700
Good to know.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.602
Actually, I ran into a jam at work and...

10:24.254 --> 10:25.996
I could use your expertise.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.593
And side note... I'd appreciate
it if you'd close your kimono.

10:29.594 --> 10:31.231
It's, like, staring at... time expired.

10:31.232 --> 10:34.585
Logging you out. Damn it!
Oh, you made me fold my hand.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.072
Dude, what happened to your stuff?

10:39.096 --> 10:42.324
It's gone, all of it... my
white leather couches,

10:42.325 --> 10:44.743
my cougar skin rugs, my protein powders.

10:45.264 --> 10:46.548
I'm totally broke.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.064
What about your new job, the suit?

10:49.994 --> 10:53.400
I took it off some Filipino dude
who fell asleep on the bus.

10:53.416 --> 10:55.288
And the charity I work at's bogus.

10:55.312 --> 10:58.481
See, Melanie told me to
get a real job, so I did.

10:58.747 --> 11:00.642
I-I became a professional poker player,

11:00.643 --> 11:03.834
but it turns out poker's crazy hard.

11:03.835 --> 11:05.098
Had to pawn everything.

11:06.427 --> 11:08.334
Don't tell Mel about my web of lies.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.856
She'd kick my ass to the curb.

11:10.356 --> 11:13.479
If you help me with this
job, I'll give you a loan.

11:13.877 --> 11:15.208
All right, how much do you need?

11:15.502 --> 11:16.463
$20,000.

11:16.474 --> 11:18.399
I have $2,000 in my savings.

11:18.436 --> 11:21.234
You won't regret this. Whoo-hoo!

11:21.436 --> 11:22.459
Already do.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.264
Hey. I might have a little problem.

11:30.361 --> 11:31.992
You remember how I gave the copier life?

11:32.001 --> 11:34.438
No. Okay, well, I did, and, uh,

11:34.439 --> 11:37.759
it sort of might be into
destroying humanity.

11:43.897 --> 11:45.334
Copier, what are you doing?

11:46.839 --> 11:49.979
It's "Terminator." The machines are rising.

11:50.299 --> 11:51.007
What do we do?

11:51.240 --> 11:52.402
Unplug it. I don't know.

11:52.403 --> 11:54.181
I have my own problems in the real world.

11:54.266 --> 11:56.004
Aah! Yes, you do, Suzie Q.

11:56.005 --> 11:57.521
How many secret rooms do you have?

11:57.624 --> 11:59.138
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:59.139 --> 12:00.363
But I spoke with Jimmie.

12:00.504 --> 12:02.569
Sounds like you got that
situation back on track.

12:02.570 --> 12:03.978
Gotta say, I did not see that coming.

12:03.979 --> 12:05.377
Well, I went that extra mile

12:05.378 --> 12:07.049
and temporarily brought Dutch aboard. 
Hmm.

12:07.338 --> 12:09.143
The guy knows cars.
He's been at Jimmie's all morning,

12:09.144 --> 12:10.726
talking shop, bonding with the crew.

12:10.727 --> 12:11.888
Apparently, he's killing it.

12:11.890 --> 12:13.903
It must be killing you.
You were willing to hire

12:13.904 --> 12:16.998
your mortal enemy to get this job done?
I underestimated you.

12:16.999 --> 12:20.127
Yes, you did. I mean, working side by side

12:20.128 --> 12:21.246
with the guy who's mashing bits...

12:21.247 --> 12:23.552
I know, I know, but it doesn't bother me.

12:26.698 --> 12:28.856
Aw, man. Hoagies are our thing.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.852
Yay, you're back.

12:32.137 --> 12:33.532
That must mean you set up the cameras

12:33.533 --> 12:34.695
in Jimmie's garage, right?

12:34.708 --> 12:35.875
Almost, Camster.

12:35.876 --> 12:38.198
Now that I've earned everyone's
respect, it's easy-peasy.

12:38.199 --> 12:39.859
Tomorrow afternoon, I'll
be alone in the garage.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.262
I'll plant the cameras then.

12:41.454 --> 12:43.465
It's really great you're
helping cam out on this, babe.

12:43.466 --> 12:45.693
Oh, had to be done.
My girl's asexual bestie was

12:45.694 --> 12:47.768
begging and crying me to do him a solid.

12:47.776 --> 12:49.469
Wasn't crying, plenty sexual.

12:50.158 --> 12:52.305
You are just so sweet lately.

12:52.417 --> 12:55.655
First, the trip to New York, now this.
Can you believe it?

12:55.666 --> 12:58.105
No. I cannot believe it.

12:58.106 --> 13:00.601
Okay, so my favorite childhood memory

13:00.656 --> 13:03.414
was this one Christmas I went
to Central Park with my dad.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.875
We sat on a bench, we ate pizza,

13:05.876 --> 13:08.519
we froze our balls off in the snow.
It was awesome!

13:08.713 --> 13:11.021
Dutch is giving me that
whole trip all over again.

13:11.460 --> 13:13.747
We're flying first class and everything.

13:13.748 --> 13:17.322
Really? First class. Sounds expensive.

13:17.323 --> 13:20.446
Nah, it's just 2 grand.
But stupid romantic.

13:20.463 --> 13:21.711
We're staying at the Plaza.

13:21.712 --> 13:24.410
♪ Hotel sex, hotel sex ♪

13:24.411 --> 13:28.061
Are you kidding me?!
I paid for that trip, Melanie, not him.

13:28.062 --> 13:30.727
Dutch has been lying to you.
He's jobless and couchless,

13:30.728 --> 13:33.290
and he lost all his money
playing online poker!

13:33.295 --> 13:34.510
You lied to me?

13:34.762 --> 13:37.379
Only about my job, my money, and my suit,

13:37.380 --> 13:40.013
which thinking about it now, I
probably took off a dead guy.

13:40.930 --> 13:42.536
Melanie, wait. 
No.

13:42.537 --> 13:45.254
We can't cancel that trip.
I didn't get travel insurance.

13:45.255 --> 13:46.559
You couldn't afford it!

13:51.039 --> 13:52.165
I'm sorry.

13:52.166 --> 13:55.475
I lost my temper and I
shouldn't have said anything.

13:55.484 --> 13:58.325
No, I'm glad you did. He's a lying jerk.

13:58.927 --> 14:00.860
Man, was I wrong about him.

14:01.412 --> 14:03.702
If you want to hoagie it up
tomorrow and talk about it,

14:04.099 --> 14:05.342
I'm your man.

14:05.386 --> 14:09.535
Yeah, we could do that, or we
could go get smashed right now.

14:09.728 --> 14:12.049
Fo' sho! 
Never say that again.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.648
Absolutely. First round's on me.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.253
All right, but no shots, okay?

14:15.254 --> 14:16.874
'Cause I'll get a little alco-horny,

14:16.875 --> 14:20.952
and I'll end up using your
body for angry revenge sex.

14:21.795 --> 14:22.618
Yeah.

14:23.406 --> 14:24.899
That would be awful.

14:25.513 --> 14:26.472
Just...

14:28.615 --> 14:29.104
Yuck.

14:29.391 --> 14:31.730
One, two, tres, cuatro.

14:31.735 --> 14:34.489
♪ You dropped a deuce on my heart, baby ♪

14:36.679 --> 14:38.918
♪ you tore it all apart, baby ♪

14:48.735 --> 14:50.918
Hey, man. I know you've been calling me

14:50.924 --> 14:53.751
about finishing that job, but
I'm in a real dark place...

14:53.969 --> 14:56.204
Mostly 'cause they cut
off my electricity,

14:56.205 --> 14:57.955
but also 'cause Mel left me.

14:58.152 --> 15:01.632
I know I promised I'd finish,
but unless my boo forgives me,

15:01.633 --> 15:03.218
I'm not gettin' up off this floor.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.669
It's Dutch, by the way.

15:04.893 --> 15:06.425
Dutch Nilbog.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.238
Whatever it takes.

15:11.308 --> 15:11.896
I'm taking off.

15:11.909 --> 15:13.035
Wait. Wait. Not so fast.

15:13.036 --> 15:15.049
We've got work to do, and
it's not gonna be pleasant.

15:15.975 --> 15:18.042
We're going to get Dutch
and Melanie back together.

15:22.351 --> 15:23.692
All right, thanks for your help on this.

15:23.693 --> 15:26.907
Here's the deal... The only way to
get my desk out of geek Siberia

15:26.916 --> 15:29.298
is to get Dutch to finish that NASCAR job.

15:29.313 --> 15:31.777
The only way to do that is
to mend his broken heart,

15:31.778 --> 15:35.642
which means we need a grand,
romantic gesture. Yay!

15:36.738 --> 15:38.801
Inclusion! It's finally happening!

15:39.032 --> 15:41.154
Operation Cupid is in full effect.

15:41.155 --> 15:44.234
We're gonna use every resource
Contra has to pull off this job,

15:44.235 --> 15:45.157
starting with...

15:47.638 --> 15:49.196
Check one. Check one.

15:49.197 --> 15:51.227
Popping P's. Popping P's.

15:51.228 --> 15:52.913
Sibilance. Sibilance.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.202
Hey, Mel. Could you help me
out with this crossword?

15:56.469 --> 15:58.358
Five letters,

15:58.359 --> 15:59.672
"a jump rope style,"

16:00.040 --> 16:01.662
"double" blank.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.188
Dutch.

16:03.189 --> 16:05.042
Dutch. Dutch. Dutch.

16:05.189 --> 16:08.776
"Terrible hairstyle for a bald man."
Comb-over.

16:08.894 --> 16:10.132
Comb-over. Comb-over.

16:10.133 --> 16:13.956
One letter, comes after "b."
"C."

16:14.004 --> 16:15.828
What kind of crossword are you doing?

16:17.240 --> 16:21.075
I was just... wondering if
you'd read my romance novel.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.985
Sorry. Busy. I really need to go.

16:24.031 --> 16:26.286
I really... I really need to go.

16:28.692 --> 16:30.570
Dutch. Comb-over.

16:31.142 --> 16:32.120
Comb-over.

16:36.523 --> 16:38.173
Mel? Is that you?

16:38.928 --> 16:41.508
Dutch... I really need to...

16:41.744 --> 16:42.992
See... you.

16:42.993 --> 16:43.819
Really?

16:44.629 --> 16:46.150
Comb-over. Come over?

16:46.274 --> 16:47.437
I'll be right there!

16:49.603 --> 16:51.448
Once Dutch takes the bait, I'll trigger

16:51.449 --> 16:53.370
the fire alarm to get Melanie
out of her apartment.

17:00.831 --> 17:02.152
All right, we got two minutes.
Go, go, go, go!

17:02.153 --> 17:06.053
El niño is up and running. Kill the alarm.

17:06.266 --> 17:09.269
I'm on it. 
All right, projector's up.

17:09.339 --> 17:12.218
Hot pie coming in. Wine is fine.

17:16.517 --> 17:17.452
Mel?

17:18.954 --> 17:19.761
What the...

17:23.930 --> 17:24.810
Dutch?

17:31.311 --> 17:32.382
Oh, my God.

17:37.198 --> 17:39.409
It's Christmas in Central Park.

17:41.691 --> 17:43.421
Did you do all this?

17:44.344 --> 17:47.816
No. I can't take credit for this, Mel.

17:47.914 --> 17:50.035
If I did, I'd just be lying, and...

17:50.288 --> 17:52.566
I never wanna lie to you again.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.096
I made up that job and bought you that trip

17:55.097 --> 17:56.340
so I could get you everything.

17:58.407 --> 17:59.871
Look, I know I'm not perfect.

18:00.472 --> 18:01.854
I mean, I'm close, but...

18:03.830 --> 18:05.540
I love you with all my heart,

18:06.587 --> 18:08.474
and hopefully, that can be everything.

18:11.017 --> 18:12.040
Come here.

18:21.149 --> 18:22.635
What do you say you pop open that wine?

18:22.806 --> 18:23.974
And I'll heat up this pizza.

18:24.105 --> 18:24.937
Hey, you better hurry,

18:24.942 --> 18:26.271
'cause, uh, I gotta be at Jimmie's

18:26.272 --> 18:29.114
first thing in the morning
to get those cameras set up.

18:31.852 --> 18:34.800
And after close inspection of
the security camera footage,

18:34.801 --> 18:36.400
I've uncovered who's been tampering

18:36.401 --> 18:37.605
with Jimmie's communications

18:38.862 --> 18:41.865
turns out it wasn't sabotage.

18:43.570 --> 18:44.434
Baba-bam!

18:44.746 --> 18:47.711
A 1982 Swony A.M./F.M. cassette player.

18:47.743 --> 18:49.752
Wait. You mean Sony.

18:49.798 --> 18:52.176
Nope, Swony-y...

18:52.177 --> 18:54.116
a cheap Guatemalan knockoff.

18:54.771 --> 18:56.121
You see, Tito here....

18:56.253 --> 18:59.205
was playing the same radio
during the last race.

18:59.251 --> 19:02.785
The oddball frequency interfered with
the headset and caused a ruckus.

19:02.786 --> 19:06.728
So I gave him an iPod, and
Jimmie is safe again.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.800
Wait. I loaned you my iPod..

19:08.813 --> 19:11.607
You said you wanted to
burn my Billy Joel...

19:11.715 --> 19:13.108
workout playlist.

19:15.091 --> 19:17.037
Well done, Dutch!

19:17.228 --> 19:19.920
Case closed.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, which I do.

19:20.977 --> 19:21.991
Whoo!

19:22.399 --> 19:25.094
Hey, boss, uh, look, I gotta talk to you.

19:25.328 --> 19:27.877
Um, I messed up. I went against your wishes

19:27.878 --> 19:29.351
and I tinkered with the copier,

19:29.352 --> 19:31.058
and now it's sentient and wants me dead.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.480
Ah, don't worry about it.
I've seen this happen before.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.230
I'll take care of it.

19:40.018 --> 19:42.323
Thanks. I-I swear, I will never try

19:42.335 --> 19:44.106
to mess with anything in the office again.

19:54.004 --> 19:55.487
You just got Oz'd.

19:56.755 --> 19:58.049
Possible catchphrase.

20:03.855 --> 20:04.864
Hey.

20:06.541 --> 20:09.258
So I just wanted to thank you.

20:09.488 --> 20:12.087
I mean, Dutch does a lot of sweet things,

20:12.131 --> 20:15.977
but I gotta say, what you
pulled off was pretty epic.

20:16.537 --> 20:17.948
Oh, it's just a part of the job.

20:18.163 --> 20:19.856
Well, thanks. Well done.

20:20.036 --> 20:22.083
You really went the distance on this one.

20:22.390 --> 20:24.407
You got your desk back. 
Thank you.

20:24.408 --> 20:26.778
No, I should be thanking you.
I mean, this job made me realize

20:26.779 --> 20:30.332
I need a good mechanic and a wheelman.
Tea bag!

20:30.963 --> 20:33.323
Ow! Aah, it burns. Whoo! Classic me!

20:33.324 --> 20:34.593
Classic you, Dutch.

20:34.866 --> 20:36.935
Yeah, I hired Dutch on full-time.

20:36.942 --> 20:38.986
What? No. Please don't. Please. Please...

20:39.129 --> 20:41.672
Already done.
Good luck with that numbers game.

20:41.689 --> 20:44.405
You guys want to get some lunch?
Usually it's just me and Cam,

20:44.406 --> 20:46.335
but you know what? Why don't we all go?

20:46.365 --> 20:47.351
Sweet. I'm buyin'.

20:48.276 --> 20:50.635
You're buyin'. 
Not so fast, kids.

20:50.778 --> 20:52.113
As a token of his appreciation,

20:52.114 --> 20:54.311
Jimmie has offered us a bitchin' bonus.

20:59.077 --> 21:00.806
Ha ha! Ha!

21:00.807 --> 21:02.260
Get 'er done!

21:04.679 --> 21:07.307
My entire body is vibrating!

21:08.980 --> 21:11.763
Oh, this feels exceptional
on my undercarriage.

21:11.818 --> 21:13.130
Is there a warp speed or something?

21:13.131 --> 21:16.026
Where's warp speed? Whoo-hoo-hoo!

21:16.575 --> 21:17.980
How am I doing, Jimmie?!

21:18.331 --> 21:19.607
That's pretty weak, Oz.

21:19.962 --> 21:22.362
Maybe you should've been the tap dancer.
Shutty!

21:22.562 --> 21:32.762
