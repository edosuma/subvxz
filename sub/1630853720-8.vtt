WEBVTT

00:14.681 --> 00:15.932
Skadoosh.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.419
Oh, Lady Veruca.

00:45.045 --> 00:49.132
Your Majesty.
You grace me at quite the late hour.

00:50.049 --> 00:52.385
Yes, um, you see,

00:52.469 --> 00:57.557
I enjoyed a generous helping
of royal cheese at supper.

00:57.640 --> 01:04.189
And it seems
I'm in need of a royal flush, if you will.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.357
Oh. Right away, ma'am.

01:27.212 --> 01:30.340
A bit of mugwort. A pinch of bladderwrack.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.466
Thank you, ladies.

01:32.550 --> 01:33.885
Whilst I have you,

01:33.968 --> 01:38.640
I was thinking of appointing Sir Alfred
as my new Master of War.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.810
Hm. Interesting.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.978
Do you not think it wise?

01:44.062 --> 01:46.356
As your loyal advisor…

01:48.817 --> 01:52.403
I only ever want
what's best for you, my Queen.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.200
Come on, you little blighter.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.502
What are you doing?

02:07.585 --> 02:09.504
-Nothing.

02:09.587 --> 02:12.924
No map, no leads.

02:13.007 --> 02:16.136
I'm bleeding out
and you're lagging behind!

02:16.219 --> 02:18.096
Prison made you useless.

02:20.056 --> 02:24.018
Keep moving. Or do I need to carry you…

02:29.357 --> 02:31.067
Useless, eh?

03:02.724 --> 03:04.601
Stealth.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.811
Camouflage.

03:06.895 --> 03:07.896
Sneak attack!

03:10.690 --> 03:14.193
A good strategy for a sneak attack
is to not yell "sneak attack."

03:14.277 --> 03:17.697
Yeah, no, totally. I know.
Just, like, practicing.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.157
Sneak attack.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.325
When we use that thumb,

03:20.408 --> 03:22.619
Klaus and Veruca
will be pulled right to us.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.162
Oh, I got a plan.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.789
And its name is Operation Ursa Major.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.379
The gauntlet would mash you
before you even got to the Ursa part.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.049
We need to take that gauntlet
out of the equation.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.177
And we need
a lot more than a belly bump.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.221
Hey, you okay? You hungry?

03:41.304 --> 03:44.098
I always get that faraway look
when I'm looking for food.

03:44.933 --> 03:45.767
Far away.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.268
I just…

03:47.769 --> 03:51.314
I've never been this close
to capturing Klaus and Veruca before.

03:51.856 --> 03:54.901
We have to get this
absolutely right.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.110
Do you understand?

03:56.194 --> 03:59.197
I do. I won't let you down, Blade.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.992
Then, Page,

04:03.576 --> 04:06.746
it's time you have
your next lesson in knighthood.

04:15.129 --> 04:18.007
Oh, is it weird to bow?
That's more of a kung fu thing.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.801
What's the knight thing? Curtsy?

04:19.884 --> 04:21.552
No, it's gotta be something tough.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.056
Plan B is still Operation Ursa Major.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.393
Klaus! Klaus.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.144
Wake up! Wake up.

04:30.228 --> 04:34.482
-Klaus! You hit your head again. Wake up!

04:34.565 --> 04:36.401
What's the matter with you?

04:36.484 --> 04:38.695
You were once the Queen's archmage,

04:38.778 --> 04:41.447
and now you're just
nothing but a crazy animal.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.747
-Shadow, stranger!

05:30.830 --> 05:32.373
Hello, love.

05:32.457 --> 05:36.294
Oh, my. Hello. Happy harvest to you.

05:37.337 --> 05:41.466
Quite the harvest, indeed.
Looks like enough for a whole village, eh?

05:42.133 --> 05:46.471
I am forbidden from telling strangers
about our secret village. I, uh--

05:48.347 --> 05:50.892
Oh, dang it!

05:50.975 --> 05:54.395
And this village that you
didn't tell me about, it's got a doctor?

05:57.356 --> 05:58.441
Listen up, Po.

05:59.984 --> 06:04.739
This training will be grueling, painful,
and may push you to your absolute limit.

06:05.364 --> 06:09.160
And should you excel,
I will advance you to the level of squire.

06:09.660 --> 06:13.039
Squire? Squire!
That's just one step below knight!

06:13.122 --> 06:15.333
Okay, so like, what am I learning?

06:16.751 --> 06:19.420
-How to disarm the enemy.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.636
It's a simple maneuver.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.721
The enemy charges at you.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.140
Okay.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.476
Alright, here I come. Whoo!

06:36.687 --> 06:38.981
-Uncle? Auntie? Grandma?

06:39.065 --> 06:41.234
Second cousin twice removed?

06:41.317 --> 06:43.736
-And then, you simply remove the--

06:43.820 --> 06:48.241
Ha! Nailed it.
Now, what's the move to get the glove off?

06:49.784 --> 06:53.329
That was the move.
You ruined it.

06:53.412 --> 06:56.040
Well, you said
to give it all I've got, so I…

06:56.124 --> 06:58.292
Let's reverse roles.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.380
Remember, do exactly as I did. Ready?

07:07.760 --> 07:10.555
Not bad. For a page.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.973
But you see, I can still--

07:12.056 --> 07:13.474
Ursa Major!

07:15.726 --> 07:16.978
Was that right?

07:17.061 --> 07:20.523
No! No, that was not right.

07:20.606 --> 07:21.941
What's with the gut check?

07:22.024 --> 07:23.818
That's not how the move works.

07:23.901 --> 07:27.738
Well, your move didn't totally work,
so I threw some mustard on it.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.366
And a little belly bump,
a little catchphrase, kapow!

07:30.450 --> 07:33.494
Is that even a kung fu move?

07:33.578 --> 07:37.957
If a kung fu master does it,
then it's a kung fu move.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.335
Will you please just do as I've asked?

07:41.919 --> 07:43.713
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.174
Give me the glove.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.680
Let's go again, Page.

07:57.518 --> 08:00.855
How much further? I'm getting tired.

08:01.939 --> 08:05.026
Maybe i-if we both pulled--

08:06.027 --> 08:09.947
A-Actually, this is great.
I-I've been meaning to do more upper body.

08:10.031 --> 08:14.619
If you don't get my brother fixed up soon,
you won't have an upper body.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.583
So very pretty and quaint.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.710
-I hate it.

08:28.549 --> 08:33.930
The harvest arrives soon, sisters.
Just as the Yaojing foretold.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.518
-Changpu has returned.
-Happy harvest.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.229
-Happy harvest, Changpu.
-Yay!

08:41.312 --> 08:43.439
Harvest! Woohoo!

08:43.523 --> 08:45.942
I'm back, sisters. And with traveler--

08:46.025 --> 08:49.153
Hello, ladies and gentle-- Mm…

08:51.572 --> 08:54.700
Huh. No gentlemen. No matter.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.035
Who's in charge here?

08:56.118 --> 08:58.621
Why, we all are.

08:58.704 --> 09:02.250
But I speak for the Yaojing,
and she flows through me.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.336
Like a gorgeous fresh mountain stream.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.381
Ooh, the Yaojing demands
you write that down, Changpu.

09:08.464 --> 09:14.220
"Like a gorgeous fresh mountain stream."
Perfect for this week's newsletter.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.098
"Flows through me, like a stream."

09:17.181 --> 09:19.517
-Mountain stream.
-Mountain stream.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.601
-Fresh.
-Fresh.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.562
Fresh mountain stream.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.146
Uh, the Yaojing?

09:24.230 --> 09:27.108
She is our great, unseen spirit.

09:27.191 --> 09:32.280
This humble forest village maintains
the mystic purity of all of her daughters,

09:32.363 --> 09:34.699
and I am her high priestess.

09:34.782 --> 09:35.700
-Our lady!
-Our lady!

09:35.783 --> 09:38.703
-She cares for us all.
-Our lady. We love her.

09:38.786 --> 09:39.620
Look here.

09:39.704 --> 09:43.958
I need someone to patch my brother up.
So take us to your doctor, now.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.587
-Did you say "brother"?
-He's here.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.797
-He's here.
-At last.

09:49.880 --> 09:50.840
Ooh!

09:50.923 --> 09:53.050
Shut it, everyone.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.094
Happy to help.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.972
Do you really need the knife?

09:58.055 --> 09:59.765
It's my lucky cleaver.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.392
Oh, lucky.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.186
Hm, fair enough. Follow me.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.773
Hey, you. Don't forget my brother.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.367
What?

10:19.452 --> 10:20.494
Where am I?

10:21.495 --> 10:23.080
What are you?

10:23.581 --> 10:25.124
Am I dead?

10:25.207 --> 10:26.834
You wish, you wish.

10:31.130 --> 10:36.093
Mm, smoky.
Like sipping a campfire.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.098
You call that tea?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.100
Tastes like sock juice.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.602
What are you doing?

10:44.685 --> 10:46.896
Enjoying the fruits of my labor.

10:46.979 --> 10:50.149
It's been months
since the Yaojing sent a traveler.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.777
We were starting to worry
we'd angered her.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.363
I mean, Changpu angers her so often.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.490
Oh, it's true, I'm a lot.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.408
Well…

10:59.492 --> 11:02.703
I cannot thank the Yaojing enough.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.288
Feels better already.

11:05.122 --> 11:08.000
In fact,
I don't feel much of anything.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.930
Wait, what's in this stuff?

11:21.013 --> 11:22.598
Well, you see,

11:22.681 --> 11:27.353
usually we do not allow men
into our secret village.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.855
-No. Never.
-They can't be trusted.

11:29.939 --> 11:33.359
But you happen to have arrived
just in time for…

11:33.943 --> 11:35.736
the harvest.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.781
Harvest? Oh, that sounds great.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.574
Will there be any food?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.660
Oi, what are you…

11:45.121 --> 11:46.831
Say, I'll…

11:48.958 --> 11:53.254
We don't usually care for a lady,
but, who are we to refuse

11:53.337 --> 11:56.340
the Yaojing's abundant harvest.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.844
Everything I foretold.

12:00.719 --> 12:01.554
Mm?

12:05.141 --> 12:07.768
Where did they go?

12:07.852 --> 12:09.520
When are we eating?

12:10.020 --> 12:12.106
You idiot.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.567
We're the harvest.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.869
-Po.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.917
Okay. Lesson over. Lesson over.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.003
What? No, no, no, I'm sorry.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.922
I'll take the mustard off
and do it exactly like you showed me.

12:40.676 --> 12:41.886
It's not you, Po.

12:42.636 --> 12:46.432
I've imagined this moment
every day for 15 years.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.811
The day they realize
that there's no more running…

12:53.772 --> 12:57.651
I have to be perfect
in every swing of my sword.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.945
Because if I am,

13:00.029 --> 13:03.657
I may look them in the eyes
and finally say,

13:03.741 --> 13:06.660
"In the name of
Her Majesty the Queen of England,

13:06.744 --> 13:11.290
I place you under arrest
for the murder of Sir Alfred of Landreth,

13:11.373 --> 13:15.294
Son of the Saxon Guard,
Knight of England."

13:18.589 --> 13:20.007
What if I can't do it?

13:28.140 --> 13:29.350
Let's go again.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.826
Pretty.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.250
I will not be locked up again.

13:54.833 --> 13:58.212
I can't breathe. I can't think.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.005
The room is spinning.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.758
Spinny-spin the room…

14:03.259 --> 14:05.678
Veruca, the moon's out.

14:06.220 --> 14:09.056
You could use those powers of yours.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.517
-Don't you understand?

14:11.600 --> 14:16.855
I used to feel connected to the Earth,
like a thread in my hand.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.441
But that thread's been cut.

14:19.984 --> 14:24.989
I can reach out and feel for it
all I want, but it's never there.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.157
Not there…

14:32.705 --> 14:33.581
Take him.

14:34.081 --> 14:37.376
-Are we eating now? Oh! Ouch!
-Klaus. Klaus. No, Klaus.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.837
-Wait!
-If anyone's gonna kill him, it's me.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.423
-Wait, where are we going? Veruca!
-No! Klausy!

14:42.506 --> 14:45.259
Oh, fear not, sister.
He goes to the Yaojing.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.176
And you?

14:46.260 --> 14:48.971
You will join us for dessert.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.764
-Veruca!

14:50.848 --> 14:52.975
Veruca!

15:00.441 --> 15:02.109
Seize the fugitive!

15:02.610 --> 15:05.195
For the murder of Sir Alfred.

15:05.279 --> 15:09.158
You can't arrest me, you dolt.
I'm the Queen's mage.

15:09.241 --> 15:13.287
We're here on her orders.
You've been plotting to betray her.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.916
Betrayal? Ha!

15:16.999 --> 15:19.752
I did what I had to do,
and I'd do it again.

15:19.835 --> 15:22.880
Now, let me go! Lemme!

15:22.963 --> 15:24.715
This isn't over.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.926
Just you wait until nightfall.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.304
Lemme out!

15:33.432 --> 15:35.893
The moon…

15:51.367 --> 15:52.701
No!

16:30.072 --> 16:30.990
Veruca!

16:34.493 --> 16:36.578
-I found you.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.957
After 15 years, I found you.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.002
Klaus? Klausy?

16:43.085 --> 16:45.629
Klaus. Klaus!

16:45.713 --> 16:47.214
Where is everyone?

16:48.590 --> 16:50.175
The other mages?

16:50.759 --> 16:51.635
Gone.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.763
It's up to us now.

17:03.856 --> 17:04.857
Klaus.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.827
The moon.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.887
Wait, wait, wait.

17:34.970 --> 17:38.766
You can't eat me.
I'm very lean. And-And gamey.

17:38.849 --> 17:43.020
Plus, I hear weasel's meat
is very high in cholesterol.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.689
Stop, please. Hot. Hot!

17:46.190 --> 17:50.194
Be comforted knowing that the Yaojing
has brought you for the harvest.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.781
And besides, you're not my first weasel.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.077
-Oh no!

18:01.288 --> 18:03.582
It's the Yaojing. Yaojing!

18:03.665 --> 18:06.794
-Veruca! She found it.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.921
Oh, you're in for it now.

18:25.979 --> 18:29.358
I-I don't understand. She's real?

18:31.193 --> 18:36.031
Oh, she's real.
Just, uh, just as I foretold.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.369
And you, all of you angered her.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.079
One more than the others.

18:49.002 --> 18:53.090
You can't be the Yaojing,
because I made her up.

18:53.966 --> 18:54.967
You're right.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.387
I'm far worse.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.389
Oh.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.826
How… How did you…

19:20.909 --> 19:21.827
Threw my voice.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.996
Ventriloquism lessons as a boy.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.373
It's useless.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.210
Hey.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.213
Maybe you're just
too in your head about it.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.551
You've been planning it for 15 years,
but nothing ever goes the way you plan it.

19:38.051 --> 19:41.138
Sometimes you've just gotta
bust a move and find a new way.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.519
You might as well
just catch them yourself.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.402
The Archmage of England has returned.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.738
You, you found the thread.

19:57.821 --> 20:00.449
Thanks to you, brother. And the moon.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.743
England will be ours.

20:02.826 --> 20:06.747
And from there, we will build
the empire we've always deserved!

20:06.830 --> 20:10.792
Blade, we'll only bring them to us
when you're ready.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.713
But this village
will have no place in it.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.761
Or maybe now's good.

20:48.705 --> 20:49.790
Um…

20:49.873 --> 20:50.707
Hi?

21:01.426 --> 21:02.886
-Veruca!

21:14.731 --> 21:17.734
Ursa Major!

21:42.259 --> 21:44.636
-The moon's gone.

21:49.599 --> 21:53.020
In the name of
Her Majesty the Queen of England,

21:53.103 --> 21:57.816
I place you under arrest
for the murder of Sir Alfred of Landreth,

21:57.899 --> 22:01.611
Son of the Saxon Guard, Knight of England,

22:02.654 --> 22:03.864
and my brother.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.037
Good work.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.330
Squire.

22:11.413 --> 22:14.499
Squire? Squire? For real?

22:14.583 --> 22:16.501
But you got the gauntlet.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.879
Thanks to your lesson in kung fu.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.429
Patience, little brother.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.768
I was 15 years in darkness.

22:33.435 --> 22:37.814
We need only wait for moonrise.
