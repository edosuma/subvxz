01:53.293 --> 01:54.954
She's on her way.

02:09.976 --> 02:11.443
Good morning, Viv.

02:11.511 --> 02:13.911
Hello, Willow. Lovely to see you.

02:13.980 --> 02:17.347
- Here she comes!
- Is that the new Louis Vuitton?

02:17.417 --> 02:19.715
I might've known
she'd be the first.

02:19.786 --> 02:22.880
Fabulous bag. She's so chic.

02:24.891 --> 02:28.224
Sorry I'm late.
We had to do a little shopping.

02:28.295 --> 02:31.423
Now that's the way to travel.
I'm so jealous.

02:31.498 --> 02:32.965
Faboo!

02:33.033 --> 02:35.007
Louis Vuitton
never looked so good.

02:35.569 --> 02:38.936
Mmm. Tell me the stones
in that collar are not real.

02:39.005 --> 02:42.532
Aren't they gorgeous?
Viv said I had to have it.

02:43.844 --> 02:46.608
- Sorry keep you waiting.
- Armand, it's fine.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.080
A brush and a seaweed wrap,
but I need her by noon.

02:49.149 --> 02:52.482
- We're having lunch with my niece.
- She'll be ready.

02:52.552 --> 02:56.488
I know, sweetheart. I'm going to miss
you, too. You take good care of her.

02:56.556 --> 02:59.320
- No waxing, OK?
- OK, no waxing for her.

02:59.392 --> 03:02.623
I hope she gives me a red bow.
I want to look my best today.

03:02.696 --> 03:05.893
- Bimini has a date with Scooter.
- Nice pedigree.

03:05.966 --> 03:08.935
Please! The dog chases parked cars.

03:09.002 --> 03:12.904
- He's crazier than a Labradoodle.
- I give it a week, tops.

03:12.973 --> 03:16.374
- Hey! Talk to the paw.
- Good for you, Bimini.

03:16.443 --> 03:21.380
It's not easy to find a mate with
papers. Let alone one you could love.

03:21.448 --> 03:26.044
Me, I'd be happy with
one who's not... fixed.

03:33.393 --> 03:34.690
Down, boy.

03:42.569 --> 03:44.127
All right, what's next?

03:44.471 --> 03:46.871
- What do you think?
- Please. She wears Harry Winston.

03:48.475 --> 03:49.567
Viv?

03:49.643 --> 03:51.941
Fabulous. I'll take two.
You should see Chloe.

03:52.078 --> 03:56.981
I'll need at least two days at corporate
in New York to meet with buyers.

03:57.050 --> 03:59.211
- You have a little beret?
- Perfection.

04:00.921 --> 04:03.014
Who needs sleep? It's Italy.

04:03.757 --> 04:04.951
Preppy little beauty.

04:05.091 --> 04:07.423
- This just came in.
- She's allergic to wool. No.

04:08.929 --> 04:11.955
- Love that.
- Oh! Fabulous!

04:12.766 --> 04:15.428
- Viv.
- I love it. And do you love it?

04:15.835 --> 04:19.065
You may have it.
I'll get you anything you want.

04:19.139 --> 04:22.165
Yes, I will. No, not you, Patrick.

04:23.043 --> 04:25.568
Hello, Jackie O.

04:36.890 --> 04:41.418
- Love the smell of dirt in the morning.
- Sam, the garden looks gorgeous.

04:41.494 --> 04:44.986
And I love the new designs
for the waterfall that you did.

04:45.065 --> 04:46.726
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.701
For everything. For giving me
a chance to prove myself.

04:50.470 --> 04:53.496
Oh, good job, Papi. Very symmetrical.

04:55.642 --> 04:57.007
<i>Ciao. Ciao,</i> Papi.

04:58.044 --> 05:02.947
Yes, yes. We did it, Papi.
Yes. Yes!

05:03.016 --> 05:05.951
Go on, take a break, Papi.
You're doing great, buddy.

05:15.228 --> 05:17.093
Hello, beautiful.

05:18.498 --> 05:20.227
You're blocking my sun.

05:20.300 --> 05:24.168
<i># Mi corazón, you shine</i>
<i>much brighter than the sun</i>

05:24.704 --> 05:27.264
<i># Why won't you be my one #</i>

05:28.975 --> 05:31.102
- What's that smell?
- Which one?

05:32.045 --> 05:34.946
The sweat of my labor
or the mint patch I rolled in for you?

05:35.015 --> 05:38.542
- Neither.
- Then it must be the fertilizer.

05:38.618 --> 05:41.985
Gross! You're covered in it.

05:42.055 --> 05:45.183
Of course. I am a landscaper.

05:48.795 --> 05:50.228
Grasshopper, <i>mi corazón?</i>

05:50.997 --> 05:53.795
I caught it myself. Very tasty.

05:53.867 --> 05:56.927
Papi, that's so... disgusting.

05:57.003 --> 06:00.734
I see you're tempted. I'll leave it here
in case you change your mind.

06:00.807 --> 06:03.037
Excuse me. We have guests.

06:03.109 --> 06:05.236
Guests? You got guests... OK.

06:06.046 --> 06:09.880
You want to go have a drink later?
There's a great puddle by the garage.

06:09.949 --> 06:11.644
OK, never mind.

06:11.718 --> 06:13.879
Aunt Viv! I'm here!

06:13.953 --> 06:15.784
An hour late, as usual.

06:15.855 --> 06:17.447
Aunt Viv, hello!

06:17.524 --> 06:21.051
How do you keep a job?
Oh, that's right, you don't.

06:21.127 --> 06:25.029
Where's Aunt Viv?
Where's Aunt Viv? Chloe, go find her.

06:25.098 --> 06:28.966
- Go on. Go find her.
- Who am I, Lassie?

06:29.035 --> 06:30.969
You're so completely useless.

06:31.037 --> 06:33.164
Of course I understand.

06:33.239 --> 06:36.970
It's just that I'm headed to
Europe to promote my new cosmetic line.

06:37.043 --> 06:39.876
No, this is wonderful news.
It's the best news.

06:39.946 --> 06:42.676
Yes, yes. OK. Wonderful. Bye.

06:44.718 --> 06:48.779
- Is everything OK, Aunt Viv?
- I don't know what I'm going to do.

06:48.855 --> 06:53.155
I am getting on a plane at 4:00,
and I gave the staff the week off...

06:53.226 --> 06:56.627
and Chloe's dog nanny just
had her baby three weeks early.

06:56.696 --> 06:59.790
- You're not taking Chloe with you?
- No, no.

06:59.866 --> 07:04.735
Obviously if it was a vacation,
of course, but this is a business trip.

07:04.804 --> 07:06.999
Four cities in ten days.

07:07.073 --> 07:10.873
She's much too delicate for that kind
of travel. Plus she hates Berlin.

07:10.944 --> 07:13.139
- What about a kennel?
- Kennel?

07:13.213 --> 07:14.942
No.

07:15.014 --> 07:18.506
No, no. I could never leave her
in the hands of strangers.

07:18.585 --> 07:21.213
Never in a million years.

07:22.288 --> 07:23.755
But you're not a stranger.

07:25.925 --> 07:27.756
- What?
- What?

07:29.462 --> 07:33.592
Here is Chloe's schedule.
Try to stay to it as much as possible.

07:33.666 --> 07:35.497
I could skip the dog park on Wednesday

07:35.568 --> 07:38.264
because Chloe's friend, Stella,
came down with fleas.

07:38.972 --> 07:42.703
I'm about to entrust you with
my greatest treasure.

07:42.776 --> 07:45.108
Take good care.

07:45.178 --> 07:46.907
I love you, sweetheart.

07:46.980 --> 07:50.279
I love you so much.
Mommy loves you so much.

07:50.350 --> 07:52.750
Bye-bye! Have fun, you two!

07:52.819 --> 07:55.413
OK. Bye!

07:56.923 --> 07:58.288
Playdate?

08:03.329 --> 08:05.229
Here you go. Good luck.

08:26.820 --> 08:30.153
Don't worry, Chloe.
Viv will be back before you know it.

08:30.223 --> 08:31.918
Rachel doesn't look so bad.

08:31.991 --> 08:34.083
You don't know the half of it.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.788
They all look so cute
in their little outfits.

08:36.863 --> 08:39.229
You didn't have to dress her.
She's so picky.

08:39.299 --> 08:43.201
- You're talking about a Chihuahua.
- She's not any Chihuahua, Angela.

08:43.736 --> 08:48.901
She's a bossy, arrogant, manipulative,
Beverly Hills Chihuahua.

08:48.975 --> 08:52.911
She has no direction. She can't keep
a job. She's never on time.

08:52.979 --> 08:55.004
I'm going to be late to my appointments.

08:55.081 --> 08:57.106
Don't get me started on her schedule.

08:57.183 --> 09:00.380
Shiatsu massages, doggy birthday
parties, couture fittings.

09:00.453 --> 09:02.887
I have to change
her outfit four times a day.

09:02.956 --> 09:04.685
I mean, look at her.

09:04.757 --> 09:06.452
She's so...

09:06.526 --> 09:08.426
...irresponsible.
...spoiled.

09:08.595 --> 09:10.187
Woof.

09:10.263 --> 09:12.823
- I need to cool off.
- Dive in, girl.

09:16.502 --> 09:17.491
Whoa!

09:17.871 --> 09:19.429
Hi, <i>mami.</i>

09:19.505 --> 09:20.529
Oh!

09:20.607 --> 09:23.041
Who is that hunk
of Chihuahua over there?

09:23.109 --> 09:25.100
- Nice.
- <i>Mi corazón!</i>

09:25.178 --> 09:27.009
The gardener.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.377
You are more lovely...

09:29.148 --> 09:31.082
- than the dawn.
- Wow.

09:31.150 --> 09:32.378
<i>Mi corazón!</i>

09:33.052 --> 09:36.920
<i>You are more lovely...</i>
than the dawn!

09:36.990 --> 09:40.118
So embarrassing. Maybe he'll go away.

09:41.294 --> 09:42.283
I only...

09:42.829 --> 09:47.163
Excuse me while I bravely defend
your garden against that dangerous bird.

09:48.067 --> 09:49.056
Hey, bird!

09:49.903 --> 09:52.565
That is one hot dog.

09:52.639 --> 09:54.573
Excuse me.
Coming through. Nice legs.

09:56.576 --> 09:58.339
Mud all over me.

09:58.411 --> 10:01.642
Hey, hey! Excuse me!

10:01.714 --> 10:04.581
Excuse me! Excuse me, <i>señor?</i>
Gardener guy?

10:06.052 --> 10:10.216
Your dog is <i>muy</i> bad.
<i>Muy, muy, muy</i> bad. <i>Mucho</i> naughty.

10:15.395 --> 10:17.488
Can you get... your...

10:18.531 --> 10:20.431
...doggie-o out of here?

10:21.367 --> 10:24.393
<i>Perdóname, por favor,</i>
but my heart must speak.

10:25.338 --> 10:27.431
I only wish to say...

10:27.507 --> 10:31.500
that if you ever need someone
to lick inside your ears...

10:32.078 --> 10:35.445
or chew the hard to reach places...

10:35.515 --> 10:38.484
or share your slumber in the sun...

10:39.185 --> 10:42.279
I would be most honored
to be that special someone.

10:42.355 --> 10:46.018
- Woof.
- Put your tongue back in your mouth.

10:46.793 --> 10:51.560
Oh. I don't think so, Papi.

10:51.631 --> 10:53.690
You mean, not now.

10:54.367 --> 10:57.029
I mean... not ever.

10:58.137 --> 11:02.301
I see. Of course. Well...

11:02.375 --> 11:03.501
This thing.

11:06.312 --> 11:08.303
Papi!

11:09.048 --> 11:12.950
Duty calls! Please have
a most wonderful day.

11:21.227 --> 11:23.024
Cool. Thanks a lot.

11:32.438 --> 11:35.032
Rachel, wake up.
I've got a mani-pedi at 11:00,

11:35.108 --> 11:37.235
and you have to make my waffles.

11:37.310 --> 11:39.301
Get up!

11:52.792 --> 11:54.054
Aunt Viv's.

11:55.028 --> 11:57.258
Hi, Angela.

11:59.565 --> 12:00.623
What?

12:01.701 --> 12:03.328
You're a genius.

12:03.403 --> 12:06.497
Yes, I can be ready
in 30 minutes. OK, bye!

12:08.307 --> 12:11.140
Pack your swimsuit, Chloe.
We're going on a trip.

12:11.210 --> 12:14.475
A trip? Ooh, where are we going?

12:15.415 --> 12:19.078
Mexico! Yeah!

12:36.769 --> 12:38.999
I love this town!

12:43.109 --> 12:45.771
- Let's check it out.
- Surfer boys, hi!

12:46.112 --> 12:47.306
Hi.

12:51.818 --> 12:53.445
I love this town!

12:54.387 --> 12:57.356
I could totally live here.
Isn't this great?

12:57.423 --> 13:00.824
I'm starting to get the feeling
there's no Four Seasons here.

13:03.429 --> 13:04.760
Whoo!

13:21.147 --> 13:23.138
- Third floor, baby.
- Woo!

13:24.851 --> 13:28.150
Hello? Somebody forget something?

13:28.221 --> 13:30.883
- I'm walking by myself.
- Chloe!

13:35.595 --> 13:38.621
I'm starving.
What's taking them so long?

13:38.998 --> 13:41.523
Wait. What time are
we supposed to meet the guys?

13:41.601 --> 13:43.569
Right now, at that club.

13:43.636 --> 13:46.127
Wait a minute. I forgot
the name of the club.

13:46.205 --> 13:50.005
- Cayuca Club!
- Right. Cayuca!

13:50.610 --> 13:51.634
Be right back.

13:52.512 --> 13:53.877
- Dinner time!
- Finally.

13:53.946 --> 13:55.880
You should dance with Bryan, Rache.

13:55.948 --> 13:57.745
- I'm gonna dance with him.
- He's cute!

13:57.817 --> 14:00.980
You'd better be making me
either prime rib or reservations.

14:03.256 --> 14:04.484
There you go.

14:05.758 --> 14:07.453
You're joking, right?

14:07.527 --> 14:10.394
I am ready to dance all night!

14:10.463 --> 14:13.921
There's only one thing this is good for.

14:14.901 --> 14:17.267
- Try this on for size.
- Come on, let's go!

14:20.106 --> 14:21.266
Chloe!

14:22.208 --> 14:25.109
That's a bad dog!
That's a very bad dog!

14:26.279 --> 14:29.248
Rachel. What did you do to her?

14:29.315 --> 14:32.512
Nothing! She's faking! Let's go.

14:32.585 --> 14:35.053
- You silly girl.
- She's so cute.

14:35.121 --> 14:38.056
- We should take her with us.
- Yes! Take me out for food.

14:38.124 --> 14:40.422
- I'm not taking the dog dancing.
- Cayuca!

14:40.493 --> 14:42.154
Hey! Wait!

14:45.898 --> 14:48.264
Come back here! Oops.

14:50.303 --> 14:52.271
Just add that to the bill.

14:57.009 --> 14:58.271
Hello?

14:58.344 --> 15:00.312
<i>Hola</i> and <i>adiós.</i>

15:06.886 --> 15:10.049
You want to dance, Rachel? Let's dance.

15:20.333 --> 15:24.235
OK. Guy with a giant knife. Moving on.

15:28.874 --> 15:32.469
If I wasn't starving,
this might actually be fun.

15:33.779 --> 15:35.474
Oh! There you are.

15:35.982 --> 15:39.383
You are in so much troub...

15:39.919 --> 15:42.581
Put me down! Who are you?

15:48.628 --> 15:53.759
Rachel, help me! Somebody, please.
I'm being dognapped!

15:55.768 --> 15:56.757
Rachel!

16:00.473 --> 16:02.805
- So... good night.
- Seriously?

16:03.743 --> 16:04.835
No kiss?

16:05.578 --> 16:06.909
Chloe!

16:08.414 --> 16:09.847
Chloe, come out.

16:13.119 --> 16:15.587
I'm not kidding. I mean it. Stop hiding.

16:16.322 --> 16:20.656
Chloe?
I'm sorry I gave you dog food.

16:21.894 --> 16:22.952
Chloe?

16:23.029 --> 16:26.089
I'll order you room service
for breakfast in the morning!

16:28.000 --> 16:31.333
- Chloe?
- What's up, love bug?

16:33.306 --> 16:34.603
Chloe's missing.

16:41.213 --> 16:44.546
I don't know where she would go.
She doesn't like to walk anywhere,

16:44.617 --> 16:47.643
- let alone run.
- Well...

16:50.056 --> 16:53.150
- What?
- <i>Las peleas de perros</i> were in town.

16:55.161 --> 16:58.688
Dogfights. They're criminals.
Always on the move.

16:59.832 --> 17:01.322
How do I find them?

17:01.400 --> 17:02.924
I have heard rumors.

17:04.337 --> 17:05.804
Mexico City?

17:07.006 --> 17:09.736
Then there's nothing more you can do.

17:09.809 --> 17:12.209
You've done everything you can.

17:12.278 --> 17:14.973
Why don't you go
put your suit on and join us?

17:15.047 --> 17:16.810
I'm going to keep looking for Chloe.

17:16.882 --> 17:19.874
And if I can't find her,
I'm going to Mexico City.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.044
Rache...

17:23.122 --> 17:24.487
Chloe!

17:43.609 --> 17:45.008
Where am I?

17:45.077 --> 17:47.307
You're in the dogfights.

17:47.380 --> 17:50.440
Dogfights? What?

17:50.516 --> 17:52.484
This is outrageous.

17:52.551 --> 17:57.545
I was born to shop, not fight.
Unless it's at a sales rack.

17:57.623 --> 18:02.492
- Quit whining, <i>princesa.</i>
- Chloe Winthrop Ashe does not whine.

18:02.561 --> 18:05.189
A delusional Chihuahua.

18:05.264 --> 18:09.792
You won't get any sympathy from Delgado,
<i>señorita.</i> He's a gladiator.

18:09.869 --> 18:11.427
A gladiator?

18:11.504 --> 18:15.372
You know. A fighter.
Delgado is the best of the best.

18:15.441 --> 18:20.140
Don't listen to Rafa, <i>chica.</i>
El Diablo's the meanest dog in the fights.

18:20.212 --> 18:25.081
Word is they fought once before,
and Delgado did not come out on top.

18:29.922 --> 18:31.685
What's he saying?

18:31.757 --> 18:34.590
<i>Ay, bendito,</i> he always
prays before a fight.

18:34.660 --> 18:36.685
Don't you speak any Spanish,
<i>chica?</i>

18:36.762 --> 18:41.699
The name's Chloe, not <i>chica.</i>
And why would I speak Spanish?

18:41.767 --> 18:44.395
- Hello! You're a Chihuahua, <i>mi hija!</i>
- So?

18:44.470 --> 18:48.873
I'm from Beverly Hills. You know, 90210,
the shopping capital of the world?

18:48.941 --> 18:51.239
She's a <i>gringa</i> from California.

18:51.310 --> 18:54.575
That's right. The only reason
I'm here is because I was stolen.

18:54.647 --> 18:58.014
- You think I volunteered for this?
- But I'm an heiress.

18:58.083 --> 19:01.109
- A hairless?
- No, an heiress.

19:01.821 --> 19:04.289
- I have a trust fund.
- Look.

19:04.356 --> 19:06.916
If you're worth something,
they'll ransom you.

19:06.992 --> 19:09.620
And if they ransom you,
they won't fight you.

19:10.296 --> 19:14.892
- Guess you have nothing to worry about.
- Well, that's a relief.

19:14.967 --> 19:18.368
I am so glad you feel better.
Now can we get a little quiet?

19:19.638 --> 19:22.903
I can't wait until Viv finds out
what Rachel's done.

19:26.846 --> 19:30.612
<i># Mi corazón,</i>
<i>I think of you day and night #</i>

19:30.683 --> 19:32.617
Hold your tacos.

19:34.587 --> 19:36.487
These scents are old.

19:37.189 --> 19:40.386
Papi? Time to go home!

19:40.459 --> 19:42.723
Where is she? Where is my Chloe?

19:45.931 --> 19:46.989
Whoa!

19:47.500 --> 19:49.263
What's going on?

19:49.935 --> 19:51.903
Hey, Papi, come on. Let's go.

19:53.172 --> 19:55.766
- Hi. <i>Hola.</i>
- Hi.

19:55.841 --> 19:59.743
I'm Rachel's friend, and...
you're the gardener, right?

19:59.812 --> 20:03.839
- I'm Sam.
- Your garden is <i>muy bonita.</i>

20:03.916 --> 20:07.784
And when I get a <i>casa,</i>
I'm so calling you to be my gardener...

20:07.853 --> 20:09.787
- because it's...
- Thank you very much.

20:09.855 --> 20:13.484
- Where's Rachel?
- Forget her, dude. Where's Chloe?

20:14.560 --> 20:16.221
And what are you hiding there?

20:18.531 --> 20:21.091
Chloe's lost in Mexico.
Rachel stayed to find her.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.657
The love of my life
is out there in trouble?

20:23.736 --> 20:26.762
She wants me to e-mail
this to her in Mexico City.

20:26.839 --> 20:28.272
So...

20:36.348 --> 20:38.316
<i>Señoras y señores!</i>

20:38.851 --> 20:41.718
You know him, you love him.

20:42.221 --> 20:46.453
<i>El campeón, El Diablo!</i>

20:56.235 --> 21:00.467
Oh. It's about time someone's
upgrading my accommodations.

21:01.874 --> 21:03.967
And now, the challenger.

21:04.043 --> 21:07.740
Weighing in at a whopping six pounds.

21:07.813 --> 21:11.510
I give you Chi-Chihuahua!

21:12.985 --> 21:13.974
Hey!

21:17.022 --> 21:18.250
Thank you.

21:19.091 --> 21:22.549
Thank you. You're too kind, really.

21:23.796 --> 21:27.254
This is so much nicer
than that stinky corral.

21:27.800 --> 21:31.531
Oh! I'm sorry.
I thought I was alone.

21:31.604 --> 21:35.631
- Mister...
- They call me El Diablo.

21:35.708 --> 21:40.270
It's certainly nice to meet you.
Clearly I'm in the wrong place.

21:40.346 --> 21:44.112
So perhaps we could
speak to the concierge or someone.

21:44.183 --> 21:45.172
Stop talking!

21:45.985 --> 21:50.217
You know, I've got a dentist who could
do something about that yellowing.

21:50.289 --> 21:51.950
- What?
- I get the idea that teeth...

21:52.024 --> 21:56.256
- are important in your line of work.
- You don't like my smile?

21:57.162 --> 21:59.790
Watch it! Say it, don't spray it!

22:01.533 --> 22:04.525
- What am I going to do?
- Sounds like he's closing in.

22:05.537 --> 22:07.698
Dog that size?
Won't be much left of her.

22:07.773 --> 22:10.105
<i>Gringa, gringa.</i>

22:10.175 --> 22:11.904
She's <i>adiós.</i> She's bye-bye.

22:11.977 --> 22:13.877
Poor little hairless.

22:15.948 --> 22:17.279
OK, that's it.

22:18.150 --> 22:20.618
Delgado? What are you doing?

22:20.686 --> 22:22.847
Huh?

22:22.921 --> 22:25.287
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

22:25.357 --> 22:28.121
- How do you do that?
- Bro, give me the combination!

22:28.193 --> 22:29.922
- Yeah, save us!
- Save us, Delgado!

22:29.995 --> 22:31.587
- Don't leave us!
- Come back!

22:31.664 --> 22:36.192
This is highly inappropriate.
Hey, hey, hey! That's cashmere!

22:38.037 --> 22:39.026
Ow!

22:41.240 --> 22:43.470
- <i>Vámonos!</i>
- <i>Hasta la</i> bye-bye!

22:45.978 --> 22:49.539
Let go before it... rips.

22:52.317 --> 22:55.753
I know it's rude to leave early,
but I really must be going now.

22:55.821 --> 22:58.119
The show's over for you, <i>chica.</i>

22:58.724 --> 23:02.091
You know, "dog eat dog" is
just an expression!

23:02.661 --> 23:04.959
- Not this time, Diablo!
- Delgado!

23:05.030 --> 23:06.691
- Move it!
- OK.

23:06.765 --> 23:09.893
You'll pay for this, Delgado!
I'll find you!

23:18.677 --> 23:21.510
Wait, wait!
Slow down, you guys! Slow down!

23:21.580 --> 23:24.071
- What's wrong?
- I told you, it wasn't my fault!

23:24.149 --> 23:26.242
Where'd the dogs go? Go, go!

23:27.186 --> 23:29.017
I want that Chihuahua!

23:38.697 --> 23:41.461
- English, please!
- Move it! Let's go!

23:47.840 --> 23:49.364
- This way! This way!
- OK.

23:56.148 --> 23:58.548
- My bootie!
- Your what?

23:58.617 --> 23:59.982
- My bootie!
- Forget it!

24:00.052 --> 24:01.212
- Forget it?
- Forget it!

24:01.286 --> 24:04.050
- The Chihuahua!
- That's Italian leather, mister!

24:04.957 --> 24:06.288
Look out!

24:08.727 --> 24:10.490
Go! Go!

24:11.830 --> 24:13.161
One at a time!

24:16.802 --> 24:20.203
Hey! Wait a minute!
You won't fit!

24:20.272 --> 24:21.330
I got it!

24:22.241 --> 24:24.607
Oh, no. I lost another bootie.

24:27.146 --> 24:29.512
I am sure I locked those cages, sir.

24:29.581 --> 24:31.981
I want that Chihuahua!

24:32.050 --> 24:33.244
Why?

24:39.792 --> 24:41.384
She's worth something.

24:41.460 --> 24:45.021
Judging by the diamonds
around her neck, it's a lot.

24:45.097 --> 24:46.086
Look out.

24:50.169 --> 24:52.569
What is all of this?

24:56.074 --> 24:57.405
The Day of the Dead.

24:57.976 --> 25:00.410
This is so beautiful.

25:01.146 --> 25:03.444
It's what humans do
to honor their ancestors.

25:04.216 --> 25:07.310
It keeps them... alive in their hearts.

25:08.253 --> 25:12.121
Helps them remember who they are,
where they came from.

25:12.191 --> 25:13.453
Wow!

25:13.959 --> 25:16.484
- You're my dog!
- Delgado, <i>gracias,</i> bro.

25:18.397 --> 25:21.230
- I'm out of here!
- I'll see ya, kid.

25:22.134 --> 25:25.626
Wait! Wait... Delgado!

25:29.241 --> 25:31.835
"See ya?" That's it?

25:31.910 --> 25:35.903
Number one rule of the streets,
<i>princesa.</i> Every dog for himself.

25:35.981 --> 25:38.040
Now, get lost.

25:38.116 --> 25:41.051
My name is not "Princesa." It's Chloe.

25:42.221 --> 25:46.920
And I am lost. And I want to be found.

25:50.562 --> 25:54.089
Look, <i>princesa...</i>
I mean... look, kid.

25:54.166 --> 25:55.895
I got my own problems.

25:55.968 --> 25:59.301
I can't go back to the fights.
I got to get out of town.

25:59.371 --> 26:02.238
- How does Beverly Hills sound?
- Too far.

26:02.307 --> 26:05.208
Come on! If you could
figure out a way back,

26:05.277 --> 26:07.541
you could live with us on our estate.

26:07.613 --> 26:10.377
If you haven't noticed,
I'm a little large for a lapdog.

26:10.449 --> 26:13.441
But you're the perfect size
for a guard dog.

26:13.518 --> 26:17.215
Our old one... Papi, he... ran off.

26:17.289 --> 26:19.086
You had a guard dog named Papi?

26:21.960 --> 26:24.019
- What hotel you staying in?
- You'll do it?

26:24.096 --> 26:26.564
Answer the question
before I change my mind!

26:26.632 --> 26:30.466
I don't know the name, but believe me,
it was no Carthay Hotel.

26:30.535 --> 26:34.335
The Carthay? There's one here.
Would they know you?

26:34.406 --> 26:38.809
They should. We're preferred guests.
We have a gold card.

26:39.511 --> 26:42.571
Why me? Of all the dogs in Mexico.

26:42.648 --> 26:45.344
Why me? All I need,
Chihuahua with booties.

26:45.417 --> 26:47.351
This'll be fun! You'll see.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.444
Here's the GPS.

26:52.925 --> 26:53.983
We're hot.

26:54.760 --> 26:57.490
Diablo, you go get me that Chihuahua.

26:58.463 --> 26:59.725
Go! Go!

27:22.054 --> 27:24.249
- Hold up a second.
- Uh...

27:24.756 --> 27:26.621
What's that sound?

27:26.692 --> 27:29.490
Hmm. Hold your breath.

27:31.930 --> 27:35.661
- What did you do that for?
- El Diablo's got your scent.

27:35.734 --> 27:39.067
Of course he does. It's Chanel No. 5.

27:39.137 --> 27:41.970
- Congratulations.
- Now I've lost another bootie...

27:42.040 --> 27:44.600
- and I stink.
- I don't smell anything.

27:44.676 --> 27:47.474
Are you kidding? I smell like a wet dog.

27:47.546 --> 27:48.808
You are a wet dog.

27:53.652 --> 27:56.917
- Look... <i>señorita...</i>
- Ashe.

27:56.989 --> 27:59.514
Ashe. I'm sorry.

28:00.325 --> 28:02.987
We're already trying to stop the fights.

28:04.129 --> 28:08.964
And we don't have time to look
for every lost dog in Mexico.

28:09.034 --> 28:11.002
This is not just any dog.

28:11.069 --> 28:14.197
This is my Aunt Viv's dog.
Chloe means everything to her.

28:16.074 --> 28:17.564
I'll tell you what.

28:18.176 --> 28:22.840
Go back to your hotel, download
that photo you were telling me about

28:23.682 --> 28:26.674
and I will see what I can do.

28:26.752 --> 28:29.380
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- You're welcome!

28:34.526 --> 28:37.188
- Hi, Aunt Viv.
- Ciao, Rachel.

28:38.030 --> 28:40.225
Yes, Capri's fantastic.

28:40.298 --> 28:44.394
I was trying the house earlier.
I was worried because nobody was there.

28:44.469 --> 28:47.404
Yeah, we went out for Mexican.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.471
Could I talk to her just a second?

28:50.542 --> 28:52.772
Um... I'll put her on.

28:56.715 --> 29:00.344
Hi, baby! How's my little baby?

29:04.256 --> 29:06.349
I miss you, too! I miss you, too!

29:17.903 --> 29:22.772
OK, here you are,
Your Highness. Carthay Hotel.

29:22.841 --> 29:26.277
I feel like I'm home already!

29:28.380 --> 29:32.111
- Thank you, Delgado. Thank you!
- All in a day's work.

29:32.651 --> 29:37.088
But... maybe you should wait out here.

29:37.155 --> 29:39.783
- Yeah, whatever.
- I don't mean it like it sounds,

29:39.858 --> 29:44.192
but they can be a little particular
about the dogs they let in.

29:45.597 --> 29:46.894
Knock yourself out.

29:47.532 --> 29:50.160
We'll be eating gourmet food in no time.

29:50.669 --> 29:53.399
- <i>Bienvenidos al</i> Hotel Carthay.
- Thank you.

29:59.778 --> 30:03.373
Excuse me. Would you be so kind
as to look at my collar?

30:03.448 --> 30:05.541
You'll find my owner's
name and number.

30:08.787 --> 30:10.755
Tshh! Get out!

30:11.189 --> 30:13.749
Hello! Ew!

30:14.459 --> 30:15.858
It touched me!

30:15.927 --> 30:17.827
Get this mutt out of here.

30:18.697 --> 30:21.097
- Mutt? How dare you!
- Edgar!

30:21.166 --> 30:24.158
I've been a preferred customer
at this hotel for years!

30:24.236 --> 30:26.261
Don't you dare!

30:28.440 --> 30:32.900
- I'm sorry.
- You are making a big mistake. Huge.

30:33.612 --> 30:37.275
Really!

30:38.116 --> 30:39.845
Oh, no.

30:39.918 --> 30:41.146
I'm...

30:41.219 --> 30:44.120
I'm... hideous.

30:46.491 --> 30:48.152
What's taking her so long?

31:10.248 --> 31:12.239
Hmm. Figures.

31:14.586 --> 31:17.953
What did I expect...
<i>de una princesa?</i>

31:27.666 --> 31:32.603
Delgado, it was so humiliating.
You won't believe...

31:35.340 --> 31:36.500
Delgado?

31:42.147 --> 31:44.138
Delgado.

32:55.487 --> 32:58.217
Excuse me. I'm here to see
Detective Ramirez.

33:01.159 --> 33:05.357
Detective Ramirez is already with someone,
<i>señorita.</i> Five minutes, please.

33:16.141 --> 33:19.110
Psst. Don't look now,
Hannah Montana, three o'clock.

33:21.246 --> 33:25.876
What are you doing here?
I mean, <i>qué</i> are you doing here?

33:25.950 --> 33:28.680
Isn't it obvious? To find Chloe.

33:28.753 --> 33:30.243
Angela told me everything.

33:30.322 --> 33:32.722
Why did you pretend
you couldn't speak English?

33:32.791 --> 33:34.952
I didn't. You just assumed.

33:35.026 --> 33:37.927
Thought you'd let me go along
and make a fool of myself?

33:37.996 --> 33:39.793
Didn't need any help with that.

33:39.864 --> 33:42.298
What makes you think
I need help from a gardener?

33:43.335 --> 33:45.064
Oh, no, she didn't.

33:45.136 --> 33:48.469
It's not that I have a
problem with that word, but,

33:48.540 --> 33:50.303
actually, I am a landscaper.

33:50.375 --> 33:52.741
And I'm not here for you.

33:52.811 --> 33:56.269
I'm here for Vivian,
because she's like family to me.

34:01.219 --> 34:06.452
I e-mailed a description
of the dog's collar to all our stations.

34:06.524 --> 34:08.650
Chloe's collar. It's worth a fortune.

34:08.726 --> 34:09.853
You're welcome.

34:11.730 --> 34:14.960
Maybe a picture of the collar
might be even more helpful.

34:15.033 --> 34:16.466
Yeah, a lot. <i>Gracias.</i>

34:17.302 --> 34:19.770
So what should we do now?

34:19.838 --> 34:21.328
We? Nothing.

34:21.406 --> 34:24.806
You go back to
your hotel and wait. Please.

34:28.079 --> 34:30.172
He's right. There's nothing you can do.

34:30.248 --> 34:33.274
What? We're Mexi-can, not Mexi-can't!

34:33.351 --> 34:36.547
I'm not going to stop looking.
He only cares about the collar.

34:36.621 --> 34:37.610
I need the dog.

34:38.857 --> 34:41.655
I'm with her, <i>amigo.</i>
My Chloe's in trouble.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.050
Hey! Papi! Hey!

34:44.129 --> 34:47.121
- Come on, fool. Let's go!
- Papi, where're you going?

35:00.412 --> 35:02.710
I cannot believe Chloe's missing this.

35:02.781 --> 35:05.875
Sebastian! Thank you.

35:05.950 --> 35:08.418
Going to be on the cover
of <i>Purebred Monthly.</i>

35:08.486 --> 35:10.386
- Oh.
- Whoo hoo!

35:10.455 --> 35:13.185
This party is off the leash!

35:13.258 --> 35:15.590
Whoa! Party!

35:16.961 --> 35:18.690
So Scooter.

35:18.763 --> 35:20.958
- Come here, Birthday Dog.
- No, Whiskey.

35:21.032 --> 35:23.500
No, that really isn't necessary.

35:23.568 --> 35:26.093
OK. Thank you, thank you.

35:26.171 --> 35:27.570
Ooh.

35:27.639 --> 35:30.540
Hey, you guys don't think
Chloe's in trouble, do you?

35:30.608 --> 35:34.669
Paa-lease. I bet Rachel whisked her
off to some faboo place.

35:34.746 --> 35:36.338
If I know Chloe...

35:36.414 --> 35:40.407
she's sitting under a palm tree
being waited on by some hunky husky.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.652
Oh! Thank you!

35:51.162 --> 35:53.630
I must be starving.

35:53.698 --> 35:57.828
- Yeah. That's our churro.
- <i>Sí,</i> our churro.

35:57.902 --> 36:00.598
Excuse me, but... I saw it first!

36:00.672 --> 36:04.199
Better back off, <i>muchachos.</i>

36:04.275 --> 36:07.108
Looks like we have
one of those Chihuahua warriors!

36:07.178 --> 36:11.979
Now look, I've been dognapped,
lost my favorite cashmere sweater...

36:12.050 --> 36:16.111
slept in a box and I'm starting another
in a series of bad hair days.

36:16.187 --> 36:18.655
So don't... push me!

36:18.723 --> 36:22.318
- Let's get out of here, man.
- Sorry... sorry.

36:22.393 --> 36:25.794
That's what I thought. Ha!

36:25.864 --> 36:29.493
It's time to pay the piper,
<i>perra pequeña.</i>

36:29.567 --> 36:31.558
- Where were we?
- Hang on, kid!

36:33.438 --> 36:38.341
Still trying to be the hero!
I'll smell you out, Delgado.

36:42.614 --> 36:45.913
The Aztec Empire's heart
was right here in Chapultepec Park.

36:45.984 --> 36:48.350
Once used by the kings
as a royal retreat.

37:01.833 --> 37:03.562
- Move it! Hurry up!
- I am!

37:03.635 --> 37:06.604
- Come on! Two at a time!
- I have four-inch legs.

37:06.671 --> 37:09.936
Come on. This way.

37:10.008 --> 37:12.135
Not this way.

37:15.013 --> 37:17.880
- Where to now?
- Now we're trapped.

37:18.182 --> 37:20.582
- Now what?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

37:32.463 --> 37:34.363
Why did you abandon me?

37:35.166 --> 37:37.361
I've already been abandoned once.

37:38.469 --> 37:40.630
You left me, I didn't leave you!

37:40.705 --> 37:43.503
I saw you in there
getting pampered, and eating...

37:43.575 --> 37:46.009
The closest I came to food
was a used churro.

37:54.218 --> 37:55.742
Come on, let's go.

37:58.156 --> 38:01.216
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you to Puerto Vallarta.

38:01.292 --> 38:04.455
- Somebody there can help us.
- That on the way to Beverly Hills?

38:09.000 --> 38:10.399
Over here. Jump in.

38:14.205 --> 38:16.002
- Delgado?
- What?

38:16.074 --> 38:18.736
Why is El Diablo after me?

38:18.810 --> 38:20.971
Vasquez must have sent him.

38:21.045 --> 38:23.240
Who's Vasquez?

38:23.314 --> 38:26.772
He runs the dog fights and anything
else he can make a quick buck at.

38:26.851 --> 38:30.048
The police have been after him
for years, but he's slippery.

38:30.121 --> 38:32.351
How do you know all that?

38:33.658 --> 38:35.319
Were you a criminal or something?

38:36.127 --> 38:39.119
Or something. Get some sleep.

38:39.697 --> 38:41.790
It's a long ride
and tomorrow's a big day.

38:41.866 --> 38:45.427
What did El Diablo mean by,
"Still trying to be the hero?"

38:50.675 --> 38:51.699
Never mind.

38:59.717 --> 39:04.518
What the...
What's this? That's Chloe's bootie!

39:05.323 --> 39:06.654
Hey, lady!

39:10.528 --> 39:13.895
What? What is it?
Chloe's bootie. Good job.

39:13.965 --> 39:16.798
She is near. I can feel it.

39:17.935 --> 39:19.163
Hey, wait for me!

39:22.106 --> 39:23.130
He said...

39:23.207 --> 39:27.268
he saw a white Chihuahua
with a bunch of dogs run through here.

39:28.046 --> 39:30.446
She was being carried
by a German Shepherd...

39:30.515 --> 39:33.678
- German Shepherd carried my Chloe?
- Let's go!

39:33.751 --> 39:36.652
I'm going to kick some tail. Papi style!

39:36.854 --> 39:39.322
Yes?

39:39.457 --> 39:41.948
<i>Someone else</i>
<i>is looking for that dog.</i>

39:43.561 --> 39:47.327
There is a lot of money riding on
this Chihuahua, do you understand?

39:47.398 --> 39:49.593
They cannot find her before we do.

39:49.667 --> 39:51.362
- <i>I'm on it.</i>
- Good.

39:56.908 --> 39:58.466
Come on, baby.

39:59.477 --> 40:01.035
Come on, Diablo.

40:16.728 --> 40:19.925
OK, this is us. We're here.
Shake your last bootie and let's go.

40:26.070 --> 40:28.971
- What's your plan?
- OK, here's the deal.

40:29.040 --> 40:33.204
Plant your paws here, keep your muzzle
shut, and wait for me to come back.

40:33.277 --> 40:37.008
But... where are you going?
Delgado?

40:37.882 --> 40:40.612
You're very withholding, you know that?

40:44.388 --> 40:46.822
I guess this is my day at the spa.

40:59.604 --> 41:01.162
Ahh.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.071
Much better.

41:07.478 --> 41:10.072
There she is.
Now, you remember the con, right?

41:10.148 --> 41:12.048
I don't really have to eat you, do I?

41:12.116 --> 41:16.780
Only swallow my legs.
OK, here we go. Easy on the teeth.

41:17.922 --> 41:19.913
- Act scary.
- OK.

41:19.991 --> 41:23.222
Help! Help, please help me!

41:23.294 --> 41:27.458
- Help me, somebody! Help!
- You're choking me.

41:27.532 --> 41:29.523
Keep your tongue to yourself.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.500
Help me! Somebody, please!

41:31.569 --> 41:34.629
This is just like <i>Animal Planet.</i>
What do I do?

41:34.705 --> 41:37.538
Something! Anything! Help!

41:37.608 --> 41:41.271
Shoo, lizard. Shoo, shoo.
Regurgitate that rat!

41:42.413 --> 41:43.744
Ew.

41:45.116 --> 41:48.142
Oh, my gosh. Are you all right? Hello?

41:52.723 --> 41:56.250
Are you an angel? Am I dead?

41:56.327 --> 41:58.955
No. And I'm not an angel.

41:59.030 --> 42:02.056
And yet you're wearing a halo.

42:02.133 --> 42:06.001
This? This is my collar
from Harry Winston.

42:06.070 --> 42:08.334
- Is that in heaven?
- Well...

42:08.406 --> 42:10.966
Sort of. Beverly Hills.

42:11.042 --> 42:12.509
Ahh.

42:12.577 --> 42:16.069
Beverly Hills.
You're a long way from home.

42:16.147 --> 42:20.641
Perhaps I can be of assistance.
I am Manuel.

42:20.718 --> 42:22.948
I work on a luxury cruise ship
as a porter...

42:23.020 --> 42:28.014
tending to the discriminating needs
of refined, upscale dogs like yourself.

42:28.092 --> 42:31.289
Really? Do you think you
could help me get home?

42:31.362 --> 42:36.766
Well, you saved my life.
It's the very least I can do.

42:57.755 --> 43:01.156
Delgado?

43:01.225 --> 43:02.522
Delgado?

43:02.593 --> 43:05.323
- Hey, Tomas.
- It's really you, cuz?

43:05.396 --> 43:08.388
What happened? Where you been?
Nobody's seen you since...

43:08.466 --> 43:10.127
You know, a while.

43:10.835 --> 43:13.827
Look... I'm doing this
little security gig.

43:13.905 --> 43:16.874
I'm taking a rich Chihuahua
back to Beverly Hills.

43:16.941 --> 43:18.636
She's got a tag
on her collar.

43:18.709 --> 43:20.506
So take her to a rescue shelter.

43:20.578 --> 43:23.342
- They'll read it and call the owner.
- Not that simple.

43:23.414 --> 43:26.747
Vasquez is looking for her,
he's got informants everywhere.

43:27.885 --> 43:30.012
He's even got El Diablo after her.

43:30.087 --> 43:33.147
El Diablo. That's why you're doing it?

43:33.224 --> 43:35.158
That <i>delincuente</i> is behind me.

43:35.226 --> 43:38.457
It's just a job. Can you get
Officer Mendez to call her tag?

43:38.529 --> 43:40.497
Yeah, OK. Bring it to me.

43:40.564 --> 43:42.361
- I'll see what I can do.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

43:46.671 --> 43:49.834
Come on, let's go.
I found someone to read your tag.

43:49.907 --> 43:53.172
- Really? So did I.
- Where's your collar?

43:53.244 --> 43:55.872
You're not the only one
who can get things done.

43:55.947 --> 43:58.177
- What?
- I gave my collar to Manuel...

43:58.249 --> 44:00.740
He is taking it to
the ship's captain to read.

44:00.818 --> 44:02.786
Manuel? Who's Manuel?

44:02.853 --> 44:05.321
The kindly pack rat
who's helping me out.

44:05.389 --> 44:08.119
I saved him from
being eaten by an iguana.

44:08.192 --> 44:10.752
An iguana? An iguana!

44:10.828 --> 44:14.264
That is the oldest con in the book!
Iguanas are vegetarians!

44:14.332 --> 44:18.359
I'm sorry. I don't meet
many iguanas on Rodeo Drive.

44:18.436 --> 44:20.267
Without your ID tag...

44:20.338 --> 44:24.297
there's nothing to separate you
from any collarless stray on the street!

44:24.375 --> 44:25.899
But... Well...

44:25.977 --> 44:29.276
Manuel promised me
he'd be right back from the ship.

44:29.347 --> 44:31.474
What ship? That ship?

44:31.549 --> 44:34.643
What happened to the
"don't talk to strangers"?

44:34.719 --> 44:36.687
You said nothing about iguanas.

44:43.961 --> 44:48.762
then I said, "Are you an
angel?" American dogs are so gullible.

44:48.833 --> 44:52.200
Chico, who is the
greatest con man in Mexico?

44:52.269 --> 44:55.830
You are. And now,
can we steal some lunch? I'm hungry.

44:55.906 --> 44:58.500
- Where did you get that?
- Please don't eat me, man!

44:58.576 --> 45:00.669
I got a wife and 300 kids to feed.

45:00.745 --> 45:03.509
- Eat him first!
- Where is the Chihuahua?

45:03.581 --> 45:07.642
Chihuahua? I don't know any Chihuahua.
I'm from the Yucatán.

45:07.718 --> 45:11.677
Of course if you'd like to meet one,
I could arrange it for the right price.

45:11.756 --> 45:13.917
You're about to be lunch.

45:13.991 --> 45:16.892
That's the right price.
How'd you know?

45:16.961 --> 45:18.155
Do something, Manuel.

45:18.229 --> 45:21.494
You're trying my patience,
<i>chaparrito.</i>

45:21.565 --> 45:23.226
Stop trying his patience.

45:23.300 --> 45:25.700
- Where is she?
- By the fountain, near the docks.

45:25.770 --> 45:30.764
I didn't know she was a friend of yours.
I was just borrowing it.

45:30.841 --> 45:32.331
Please don't hurt me.

45:34.111 --> 45:35.703
Hmm. Hmm.

45:35.813 --> 45:39.112
Ha! That's dog's lucky
I didn't cha-cha on his chest.

45:39.183 --> 45:42.584
You know, Manuel, I don't think
that dog was a friend of hers.

45:42.653 --> 45:44.848
It's not our problem, Chico.

45:44.922 --> 45:48.358
Come on, let's go raid a piñata.
I feel like feeding my sweet tooth.

45:48.426 --> 45:53.295
Leave me out of this, Manuel.
Where there's a piñata, there's a stick.

45:56.767 --> 45:59.395
- Uh, Delgado?
- Yeah?

45:59.470 --> 46:01.461
What are we doing here?

46:01.539 --> 46:05.100
- This is where we meet the coyote.
- A coyote?

46:05.176 --> 46:09.237
A smuggler. They sneak collarless dogs
like us across the border.

46:12.683 --> 46:16.141
You used to be a police dog, didn't you?

46:16.220 --> 46:20.987
That's how you know Sergeant Tomas.
That's how you can do all those things.

46:21.058 --> 46:24.391
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Did you quit? Did you get fired?

46:24.462 --> 46:26.259
Did you do something wrong?

46:26.330 --> 46:29.925
Yes, I did something wrong, OK?
You satisfied?

46:30.734 --> 46:31.826
Now, just drop it.

46:32.603 --> 46:34.298
OK. OK.

46:35.773 --> 46:39.106
There he is. We're on. Follow me.

46:39.844 --> 46:42.745
- And no more questions.
- OK. OK.

46:44.782 --> 46:48.445
- But what was it? Was someone hurt?
- Drop it! Just drop it!

46:49.587 --> 46:51.077
You're driving me crazy.

46:51.155 --> 46:55.091
You're not exactly the most charming
traveling companion either.

46:55.159 --> 46:57.593
- Good, because we're parting ways.
- What?

46:58.662 --> 47:01.529
Wait, wait! What are you doing?

47:02.266 --> 47:04.257
This train will take you to Tijuana.

47:04.335 --> 47:05.461
- But...
- But nothing.

47:05.536 --> 47:07.470
The coyote will take you
over the border.

47:07.671 --> 47:09.901
- <i>Buenos Días.</i>
- <i>Wha...</i>

47:09.974 --> 47:12.966
Make yourself at home.

47:13.677 --> 47:15.201
Best of luck.

47:15.713 --> 47:18.739
But... you promised.

47:24.421 --> 47:26.321
Delgado...

47:45.276 --> 47:48.439
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.

47:48.512 --> 47:50.377
Don't... What am I doing?

47:56.687 --> 47:59.349
- Delgado!
- Chloe!

48:01.725 --> 48:04.717
- Delgado!
- Chloe!

48:06.197 --> 48:07.926
Come on. Jump!

48:07.998 --> 48:10.262
It's a fast train!

48:10.334 --> 48:13.167
You can do it! Jump!

48:14.572 --> 48:16.472
That hurt.

48:16.607 --> 48:18.234
OK, good.

48:18.676 --> 48:21.770
- I could use a little help.
- I'll pull you up.

48:25.683 --> 48:29.346
Don't help. Don't help.

48:36.026 --> 48:39.154
What can I say? A promise is a promise.

48:39.230 --> 48:41.221
Sure thing, Delgado.

48:44.368 --> 48:47.496
Sam! How do you say
"lost" in Spanish?

48:57.548 --> 48:59.140
Chloe.

48:59.850 --> 49:01.249
Wait, he's got something.

49:03.854 --> 49:06.345
Papi! Papi!

49:08.559 --> 49:12.655
You! That scent.
Where did you get that scent?

49:12.730 --> 49:14.322
Maybe you haven't noticed,

49:14.398 --> 49:16.764
but I'm currently napping
in a sewage pipe.

49:16.834 --> 49:19.564
You mean the moldy taco?

49:19.637 --> 49:23.004
No, fool. The perfume. It's Chloe's.

49:23.073 --> 49:25.598
She's an American Chihuahua.

49:25.676 --> 49:28.338
Her ears are as pink as seashells...

49:28.412 --> 49:32.212
and her nose is like a raspberry.

49:32.283 --> 49:35.013
- You serious, bro?
- Eh? A berry?

49:36.720 --> 49:41.748
Is she kind of uppity?
Wears matching clothes?

49:41.825 --> 49:44.817
- You know her? Where is she?
- Last we saw her...

49:44.895 --> 49:47.557
- she was with Delgado on the run.
- Yeah.

49:47.631 --> 49:50.794
- Mm-hm.
- Delgado? Who is this Delgado?

49:52.269 --> 49:54.464
I want to hear more. Come with me.

49:56.774 --> 49:59.038
Looks like he found a couple of friends.

49:59.109 --> 50:01.839
Just what we need, stray dogs.

50:03.147 --> 50:07.584
Papi was a stray dog.
I saved him from the pound.

50:08.786 --> 50:09.844
Hey, buddy.

50:11.622 --> 50:15.718
He inspires me every day.
What inspires you, Rachel?

50:17.695 --> 50:19.390
Get back to you on that.

50:19.463 --> 50:21.431
Hey.

50:21.498 --> 50:25.958
Look at that. How you doing? Hello.

50:26.904 --> 50:29.930
I guess he is kind of cute.
We could take them with us,

50:30.007 --> 50:32.305
but you have to give them a bath,
they stink.

50:32.376 --> 50:33.775
I can handle that.

50:33.844 --> 50:36.506
- You stink! Oh!
- You just need a bath.

50:36.580 --> 50:39.811
Oh, I love this!

50:39.883 --> 50:42.977
I think I'm in love
with the <i>gringa.</i>

50:46.357 --> 50:49.656
- I think he likes it.
- I think he likes you.

50:52.296 --> 50:53.729
Where you going? Wait for me!

51:06.009 --> 51:09.137
Oh, yeah. <i>Mira,</i> I'm clean.
I'm clean. I never knew clean.

51:09.213 --> 51:10.578
I know clean now.

51:10.647 --> 51:13.582
I have never had
my teeth brushed before.

51:13.650 --> 51:15.584
It's... minty.

51:15.652 --> 51:17.449
It's weird.

51:17.521 --> 51:19.318
Papi, this is great!

51:19.390 --> 51:22.018
- We should call room service.
- Let's order a movie.

51:23.260 --> 51:24.989
Have we found a home, Papi?

51:25.062 --> 51:28.998
I don't know, but they'll make sure
you're safe.

51:29.066 --> 51:31.728
Sam did it for me.

51:33.670 --> 51:34.728
See you tomorrow.

51:34.805 --> 51:36.898
- Come on.
- No, they can stay with me.

51:38.108 --> 51:39.302
I take responsibility.

51:40.144 --> 51:41.372
Cool.

51:41.445 --> 51:43.242
Papi, what do you see, <i>compa?</i>

51:43.313 --> 51:45.247
It's a big place, my little friend.

51:45.983 --> 51:49.885
I may be small, but I am fighting...

51:49.953 --> 51:52.615
for something... bigger than all of it.

51:54.291 --> 51:56.350
<i>Mi Corazón.</i>

52:18.982 --> 52:21.610
Excuse me. Where are you from?

52:21.685 --> 52:25.451
- I'm from Beverly Hills.
- Where is that?

52:25.522 --> 52:30.289
Well... it feels like
a long way from here.

52:31.328 --> 52:34.263
<i>Señorita,</i> what is that?

52:34.331 --> 52:37.095
It's a bootie. I lost the others.

52:37.167 --> 52:40.261
All the dogs in Beverly Hills
wear them to protect their feet.

52:40.337 --> 52:42.567
It must be very dirty there.

52:42.639 --> 52:47.133
No. Actually, it's probably
the cleanest place I know.

52:47.978 --> 52:50.742
Then that's pretty silly
to wear a bootie.

52:50.814 --> 52:52.281
Pedro, be polite.

52:53.851 --> 52:55.443
You know something, Pedro?

52:58.155 --> 52:59.213
You're right.

53:34.258 --> 53:36.249
Rachel.

53:37.494 --> 53:38.483
Rachel.

53:38.562 --> 53:41.030
Come on, Sleeping Beauty, let's go.

53:41.098 --> 53:42.793
Detective Ramirez called.

53:42.866 --> 53:46.165
A white Chihuahua and a German
Shepherd were seen in Puerto Vallarta.

53:46.236 --> 53:49.330
They're not sure if it was her,
she wasn't wearing her collar.

53:49.406 --> 53:51.704
What? Someone stole Chloe's collar?

53:51.775 --> 53:54.710
I'm going to go
all kinds of Mexican on him.

53:58.081 --> 54:00.606
Chico, I have this pain
in the pit of my stomach.

54:00.684 --> 54:04.484
- Must have been the Pop Rocks.
- Or it could be... guilt.

54:04.555 --> 54:07.183
We should have never
stolen that <i>chica's</i> collar.

54:07.257 --> 54:08.747
Now she'll never get home.

54:15.265 --> 54:16.755
Let's get out of here!

54:35.352 --> 54:37.217
Make a left, make a left.

54:37.287 --> 54:39.312
Aisle four, tortillas on the floor.

54:40.857 --> 54:44.088
- I feel naked.
- Every man for himself!

54:47.164 --> 54:49.325
- My head!
- Go through his legs!

54:49.399 --> 54:50.798
This way. Come on!

54:50.867 --> 54:52.061
Back the other way!

54:55.539 --> 54:56.801
Get off me!

54:59.910 --> 55:02.208
Hey, Chico! We're home free!

55:06.550 --> 55:08.017
Back up, back up!

55:10.520 --> 55:11.987
That's what you get!

55:20.430 --> 55:22.295
Hey! He's got my diamonds!

55:22.366 --> 55:24.095
- Our diamonds.
- Whatever.

55:39.883 --> 55:43.250
Wake up! The conductor's coming!
Hide! <i>Rápido,</i> hide!

55:48.158 --> 55:49.489
What's going on?

55:49.559 --> 55:52.289
- Delgado, what's happening?
- We got trouble.

55:53.230 --> 55:55.289
Hide behind the crate.
I'll distract him.

55:55.365 --> 55:57.390
Don't come out,
no matter what happens.

55:57.467 --> 55:58.559
But, Delgado...

55:58.635 --> 56:00.603
Don't come out,
no matter what happens.

56:00.671 --> 56:02.866
- What are you gonna do?
- Something crazy.

56:26.496 --> 56:28.396
Well, that used to be easier.

56:33.103 --> 56:34.400
Just my luck.

56:34.471 --> 56:36.735
Delgado!

56:37.441 --> 56:39.409
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my back.

56:39.476 --> 56:41.376
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

56:41.445 --> 56:46.542
I just jumped off a train!
By myself! And it was moving.

56:47.417 --> 56:49.851
I told you to stay onboard.

56:49.920 --> 56:53.447
But we're in this together.
I couldn't leave you here.

56:55.225 --> 56:57.455
I've never had a friend like you.

56:58.495 --> 57:01.521
You should have stayed, kid.
Look around.

57:02.566 --> 57:04.033
You should have stayed.

57:08.271 --> 57:11.069
I told the local police
I found the collar on a rat.

57:11.141 --> 57:13.166
But they didn't believe me.

57:13.243 --> 57:16.371
I went to turn the diamonds in,
and they tried to arrest me.

57:16.446 --> 57:18.937
Sorry for the confusion, <i>señor.</i>

57:19.015 --> 57:21.381
The rat, he's clever.

57:21.451 --> 57:23.351
<i>Oye,</i> this <i>hombre</i>
needs help.

57:23.420 --> 57:26.514
I set traps to keep him out,
but he always gets in!

57:27.257 --> 57:28.986
Sneaky, sneaky mouse.

57:29.059 --> 57:30.321
You know what you need?

57:30.393 --> 57:33.157
A guard dog.

57:33.230 --> 57:36.028
- He's a stray.
- Yeah, he's a stray...

57:36.099 --> 57:38.226
but he's a really good dog.

57:45.909 --> 57:48.002
Thanks for
returning Chloe's collar.

57:48.078 --> 57:51.047
Congratulations, <i>amigo.</i>
You have a home.

57:51.114 --> 57:54.106
<i>Gracias,</i> Rafa.
It will happen for you, too.

57:54.184 --> 57:55.776
Stay brown, brother.

57:55.852 --> 57:58.082
Come on.
Ain't nothing to it but to do it.

57:58.155 --> 58:00.487
- <i>Adiós</i>
- <i>Adiós,</i> Chucho.

58:00.557 --> 58:02.149
Hey, don't chew the furniture.

58:02.225 --> 58:04.250
- Good luck finding your dog.
- Thank you.

58:06.029 --> 58:08.395
I just got off
with the Puerto Vallarta police.

58:08.465 --> 58:12.299
There was some dog trouble
on the northbound train this morning.

58:12.369 --> 58:14.166
A German Shepherd jumped off.

58:15.405 --> 58:16.463
Chloe.

58:17.340 --> 58:19.865
- Thank you.
- Call me if you find out anything.

58:19.943 --> 58:23.470
- Follow the tracks north.
- Through the Sonoran Desert.

58:23.547 --> 58:25.139
This will be great.

58:25.215 --> 58:27.240
She's getting away with my diamonds.

58:27.317 --> 58:30.514
I think that that's like...
karma, man.

58:30.587 --> 58:34.580
See, you steal it,
and eventually it is stolen from you.

58:34.658 --> 58:36.216
And I steal it back.

58:37.093 --> 58:39.061
- How you going to do that?
- Quiet!

58:57.814 --> 59:01.045
So, Bimini says that
she's going out with Scooter...

59:01.117 --> 59:03.278
who I happen to know
is completely crazy.

59:03.353 --> 59:05.116
Please, make it stop.

59:05.188 --> 59:08.351
I can't say that to her.
I have to be supportive, right?

59:09.326 --> 59:12.352
Wait a minute. Haven't we
passed this tree before?

59:13.163 --> 59:16.997
No, you're mistaken.
We've been walking for hours.

59:17.067 --> 59:20.059
- But I tinkled there.
- You what?

59:20.136 --> 59:22.127
You tinkled?

59:22.205 --> 59:23.399
Can't you tell?

59:26.610 --> 59:31.206
Oh, my... You can't smell, can you?

59:34.517 --> 59:36.985
- No.
- What happened?

59:37.053 --> 59:39.214
It's OK, you can tell me.

59:40.423 --> 59:42.721
I didn't... quit the police force.

59:43.460 --> 59:47.260
They let me go because
I could no longer follow a scent.

59:49.099 --> 59:51.192
Now we're out here walking in circles.

59:52.202 --> 59:53.396
I'm sorry, kid.

59:55.171 --> 59:57.230
- What's that?
- Mountain lions!

59:57.774 --> 01:00:00.538
- I'm scared, Delgado.
- I know.

01:00:01.278 --> 01:00:03.872
We better get moving.
We got to get out of the open.

01:00:03.947 --> 01:00:05.642
- OK.
- Let's go. Double time.

01:00:18.061 --> 01:00:21.622
Delgado, what happened to you?

01:00:21.698 --> 01:00:23.689
Why can't you smell anything?

01:00:28.838 --> 01:00:30.169
Well...

01:00:32.509 --> 01:00:36.741
My partner and I...
we were on a major bust.

01:00:38.415 --> 01:00:39.677
<i>I was on point.</i>

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:44.711
<i>Before I knew it I was blind-sided.</i>
<i>Then it all went bad.</i>

01:00:49.426 --> 01:00:52.953
<i>While I was down,</i>
<i>my partner got hurt.</i>

01:00:55.966 --> 01:01:00.494
<i>He was never the same after that.</i>
<i>And neither was I.</i>

01:01:04.908 --> 01:01:07.103
I should have sensed him coming.

01:01:07.177 --> 01:01:10.203
Next day I woke up
and couldn't smell a thing.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.180
Were you hurt?

01:01:12.248 --> 01:01:14.739
No. They say it's all in my head.

01:01:15.852 --> 01:01:17.149
In my head.

01:01:18.321 --> 01:01:19.310
They found us!

01:01:19.389 --> 01:01:22.722
I'll hold them off as long as I can
while you run. Understand?

01:01:22.792 --> 01:01:24.783
They're just cats.
You could take them.

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:29.724
We need a miracle. Run when I say run!

01:01:30.367 --> 01:01:32.392
Come on! Take them!

01:01:32.469 --> 01:01:33.766
Yeah, you can do it!

01:01:35.505 --> 01:01:36.767
Don't be afraid!

01:01:38.308 --> 01:01:40.742
Go, Delgado! Go, Delgado!

01:01:43.513 --> 01:01:45.845
- Run, kid! Run, now!
- OK, OK.

01:01:45.915 --> 01:01:47.507
- Run and hide!
- Here. I'm here.

01:01:47.584 --> 01:01:49.313
This is not hiding.

01:02:14.511 --> 01:02:16.604
Say hello to my little friends.

01:02:23.453 --> 01:02:25.683
Whoa! That's some bark you guys got.

01:02:25.755 --> 01:02:29.213
I am Montezuma!
Come with us if you want to live.

01:02:29.292 --> 01:02:31.419
Yeah, I want to live.

01:02:32.295 --> 01:02:33.762
Now I've seen it all.

01:02:38.802 --> 01:02:42.169
Can you help us get back
to civilization, Montezuma?

01:02:42.238 --> 01:02:43.671
Of course.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.937
But it is too dangerous
to travel these canyons after dark.

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:49.877
You will spend the night here with us.

01:02:49.946 --> 01:02:51.607
Where are we?

01:02:51.681 --> 01:02:56.175
You are in Chihuahua.
Birthplace of our mighty breed.

01:02:56.252 --> 01:02:58.812
I was born in Beverly Hills.

01:02:58.888 --> 01:03:02.881
<i>Sí,</i> but your ancestors
came from here.

01:03:03.993 --> 01:03:08.157
The Aztec people left long ago,
but we remain.

01:03:10.533 --> 01:03:12.467
Wow.

01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:29.341
Did you hear what he said, Delgado?

01:03:29.419 --> 01:03:33.185
- I come from a mighty breed.
- Yeah, mighty annoying.

01:03:33.256 --> 01:03:37.022
You're just mad because
we were saved by little dogs.

01:03:37.093 --> 01:03:38.321
Very little dogs.

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:43.028
Tonight we celebrate your arrival.

01:03:44.134 --> 01:03:45.863
Thank you, Montezuma.

01:03:45.935 --> 01:03:48.597
Please, call me Monte.

01:03:49.539 --> 01:03:51.530
<i>Ay yi yi.</i>

01:03:57.947 --> 01:04:00.677
Wow! All this for me, Monte?

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:02.183
Yes, Chloe.

01:04:02.252 --> 01:04:06.211
When a Chihuahua comes home,
it is cause for celebration.

01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:08.917
Even a Beverly Hills Chihuahua?

01:04:08.992 --> 01:04:13.952
Of course. No matter where
you come from, you are one of us.

01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:16.931
Tiny but mighty.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.334
Mighty? But I'm just... a lapdog.

01:04:21.404 --> 01:04:23.269
A lapdog? No.

01:04:24.007 --> 01:04:28.103
Do not insult yourself. Do not insult
the Chihuahua race.

01:04:28.178 --> 01:04:31.170
- <i> No más.</i>
- No más?

01:04:31.247 --> 01:04:35.081
<i>Sí,</i> it means "no more."

01:04:35.151 --> 01:04:39.611
We Chihuahuas are not toys
or fashion accessories.

01:04:39.689 --> 01:04:41.020
<i> No más.</i>

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:45.686
We were not bred to wear silly hats
and ride in purses!

01:04:45.762 --> 01:04:46.888
<i>No más.</i>

01:04:46.963 --> 01:04:50.831
We will no longer
be spoken to with baby talk.

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.859
We have been called "teacup"
and "tiny toy" for too long.

01:04:54.938 --> 01:04:56.337
<i>No más!</i>

01:04:56.406 --> 01:04:59.068
Names like Fifi, Foo-Foo...

01:04:59.142 --> 01:05:01.940
Pookie, Pumpkin, or Squirt.

01:05:02.011 --> 01:05:03.342
<i>No más!</i>

01:05:03.413 --> 01:05:08.476
Yes, we Chihuahuas shake, but not for
the amusement of humans.

01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:13.614
We shake because we know the power
of our inner strength. Our bark.

01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:14.714
<i>No más!</i>

01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:18.887
Yes, we are tiny, but we are mighty!

01:05:18.962 --> 01:05:22.955
<i>No más! No más! No más!</i>

01:05:23.032 --> 01:05:28.197
Join with us, Chloe.
Embrace <i>no más.</i> Find your bark.

01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:30.705
My bark?

01:05:30.773 --> 01:05:34.265
<i>Sí!</i> That which makes you mighty.

01:05:34.344 --> 01:05:37.006
That which makes you... you.

01:05:37.714 --> 01:05:41.548
We are Chihuahuas, hear us roar.

01:05:50.827 --> 01:05:52.226
That was embarrassing.

01:05:52.295 --> 01:05:56.561
Don't worry, little one. Your bark will
come when you need it most.

01:06:29.098 --> 01:06:30.759
Last one in the house is a chew toy!

01:06:33.236 --> 01:06:34.225
They have room.

01:06:34.304 --> 01:06:35.862
Come on. Little more.

01:06:35.938 --> 01:06:38.429
- You got it now. Now pull.
- I got it, I got it.

01:06:38.508 --> 01:06:41.409
- Sweet smell of success.
- I'm smelling something else.

01:06:42.845 --> 01:06:47.248
There's the bag. There's the bag that's
got my diamonds. Hey, watch your nose!

01:06:47.317 --> 01:06:49.785
I don't feel right about this.

01:06:49.852 --> 01:06:52.753
Look, my neck flap is swelling up.

01:06:53.423 --> 01:06:57.223
Stop with the guilt.
Iguanas are supposed to be cold-blooded.

01:06:57.293 --> 01:07:01.457
You know I was born in captivity.
I grew up under a heat lamp.

01:07:01.531 --> 01:07:03.522
Snap out of it. We got a job to do.

01:07:03.599 --> 01:07:07.228
Ah-hah! You're the pack rat
who stole the collar!

01:07:07.303 --> 01:07:09.794
See? You're so busted, Manuel.

01:07:09.872 --> 01:07:14.036
Hey, dude, you got me mixed up with
another rat. You know we all look alike.

01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:16.340
- No, no. It's him. He did it.
- What?

01:07:16.412 --> 01:07:18.846
Now the love of my life
is out there in trouble.

01:07:18.915 --> 01:07:20.542
- Not because of us.
- No?

01:07:20.616 --> 01:07:22.743
- We were trying to... save her.
- Yeah.

01:07:22.819 --> 01:07:25.014
From the demon dog that's hunting her.

01:07:25.088 --> 01:07:27.818
Tell me about this demon dog.

01:07:55.585 --> 01:07:59.316
Chloe, you can always stay here with us.

01:08:00.123 --> 01:08:02.717
This place is amazing, Monte.

01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:07.786
But there's someone at home who's
probably worried and missing me...

01:08:07.864 --> 01:08:09.832
and I miss him.

01:08:09.899 --> 01:08:11.958
Your <i>corazón?</i>

01:08:12.034 --> 01:08:15.492
<i>Mi corazón.</i> What does that mean?

01:08:15.571 --> 01:08:17.265
My heart.

01:08:18.441 --> 01:08:21.035
I never even gave him a chance.

01:08:21.109 --> 01:08:24.944
We Chihuahuas come
in many shapes and colors...

01:08:25.014 --> 01:08:29.951
but when you look not with your eyes,
but with your soul,

01:08:30.019 --> 01:08:32.647
there we're all the same.

01:08:32.721 --> 01:08:36.658
Listen... back there with the lions...

01:08:36.725 --> 01:08:40.423
...uh... uh... thanks.

01:08:40.496 --> 01:08:44.728
But of course. We are Chihuahuas.

01:08:47.437 --> 01:08:51.635
Ah! Civilization at last.
We made it, Delgado.

01:08:52.341 --> 01:08:54.241
- Delgado!
- Just keep paddling!

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:56.642
Whoa!

01:08:56.712 --> 01:09:00.671
- That was fun!
- Yeah, you're a real aquatic goddess.

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.877
- Delgado, look!
- What?

01:09:03.953 --> 01:09:06.478
Is that you? Nice toga.

01:09:06.555 --> 01:09:10.014
I can't believe Rachel's looking for me.

01:09:10.091 --> 01:09:11.582
Let's get some help.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.167
- Chloe.
- <i>Sí.</i>

01:09:37.953 --> 01:09:41.582
We always kept a dog
when my husband was alive.

01:09:43.292 --> 01:09:48.252
He'd make a great companion.
You guys are perfect for each other.

01:09:48.331 --> 01:09:50.265
Somebody's got a lady friend.

01:09:50.332 --> 01:09:52.163
I have a home.

01:09:53.035 --> 01:09:57.165
We're on our way. Hey, Rachel,
that was Ramirez. They found Chloe.

01:10:06.883 --> 01:10:08.908
Whoa. Awkward.

01:10:10.586 --> 01:10:13.783
We should go.
Ramirez is going to meet us there.

01:10:13.856 --> 01:10:16.086
I told you,
everything's going to be fine.

01:10:30.973 --> 01:10:32.406
This is the place.

01:10:36.445 --> 01:10:37.434
Chloe!

01:10:43.286 --> 01:10:44.275
Hello?

01:10:45.154 --> 01:10:48.988
OK, how about here?
You American dogs are so picky.

01:10:51.727 --> 01:10:54.662
OK, go. What?

01:10:56.465 --> 01:11:00.367
Ah. Excuse me, <i>señorita.</i>
Please, please, go.

01:11:05.775 --> 01:11:08.107
I've seen that <i>gringo</i> before.

01:11:11.147 --> 01:11:14.583
<i>Oye,</i> that van.
My Chloe's been there.

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:16.914
Right on, Mighty Dog. Power to the Papi.

01:11:16.986 --> 01:11:19.352
- Now go get her!
- Go get your <i>princesa.</i>

01:11:19.422 --> 01:11:21.652
- <i>¡Mi corazón!</i>
- So romantic.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.721
Man, I thought we'd
never get rid of him.

01:11:26.796 --> 01:11:29.424
- Come on.
- Now I'll finally get my diamonds.

01:11:29.498 --> 01:11:31.693
For the love of a banana,
hurry. Ow!

01:11:42.278 --> 01:11:43.267
<i>Señora?</i>

01:11:46.415 --> 01:11:48.747
Oh, no. No!

01:11:51.354 --> 01:11:52.480
Chloe!

01:11:54.857 --> 01:11:57.451
- Turn me loose!
- What did he say?

01:11:57.526 --> 01:11:59.960
- Don't worry, we're going to find her.
- What?

01:12:00.029 --> 01:12:01.291
Oh!

01:12:02.298 --> 01:12:03.629
I'm going to look for her.

01:12:05.434 --> 01:12:06.423
Kid!

01:12:09.705 --> 01:12:12.367
Kid! Where are you? Chloe!

01:12:13.809 --> 01:12:17.404
Where are you taking me?

01:12:36.532 --> 01:12:38.693
Good job, Diablo. Good job.

01:12:42.838 --> 01:12:46.399
You've been a lot of trouble, huh?
I hope you're worth it.

01:12:46.475 --> 01:12:49.069
I need to call the owners,
so get the dog in the van.

01:12:49.145 --> 01:12:50.237
Yes, sir.

01:12:57.153 --> 01:12:58.381
Surprise!

01:13:00.089 --> 01:13:02.649
Don't mess with a Chihuahua!

01:13:05.394 --> 01:13:07.692
Papi! What are you doing here!

01:13:07.763 --> 01:13:09.958
Rescuing you. Run!

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.360
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:15.737
Go! Diablo, go!

01:13:17.373 --> 01:13:20.274
- Get that Chihuahua!
- Which one?

01:13:20.342 --> 01:13:21.502
- The mean one!
- Papi!

01:13:21.577 --> 01:13:24.478
- We're trapped!
- I will protect you, <i>mi corazón.</i>

01:13:30.086 --> 01:13:31.519
Hold on, Chloe!

01:13:31.954 --> 01:13:33.546
Come on, little brat.

01:13:40.429 --> 01:13:41.521
Ow!

01:13:41.597 --> 01:13:43.861
Oh, my back. I need an aspirin.

01:13:43.933 --> 01:13:46.163
- Doesn't that hurt?
- You see a tooth around?

01:13:46.235 --> 01:13:48.203
You two! What are you doing here?

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:49.567
It's not what you think.

01:13:49.638 --> 01:13:52.698
Look... we're not trying
to steal this collar.

01:13:52.775 --> 01:13:54.709
- Right.
- Maybe we are.

01:13:54.777 --> 01:13:57.746
Look, what my partner's
trying to say is, if you hurry,

01:13:57.813 --> 01:14:00.043
- you can pick up her scent using this.
- Yeah.

01:14:01.183 --> 01:14:03.048
- I can't.
- What?

01:14:03.119 --> 01:14:06.088
I make this noble gesture,
you're not even going to try?

01:14:06.155 --> 01:14:09.022
What's the point of having that
thing on the end of your face?

01:14:10.659 --> 01:14:13.059
- I can't!
- She needs you, man.

01:14:13.129 --> 01:14:16.724
- What part don't you understand?
- She needs you, man!

01:14:16.799 --> 01:14:18.858
You can do it! Smell.

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:24.332
- That's it.
- You can do it, Delgado. Come on.

01:14:25.074 --> 01:14:27.372
Smell.

01:14:27.443 --> 01:14:31.174
I'm getting something. Pack rat.

01:14:32.081 --> 01:14:33.912
Old nachos.

01:14:35.918 --> 01:14:38.352
Chanel No. 5.

01:14:38.854 --> 01:14:40.253
He's got it!

01:14:40.756 --> 01:14:42.383
I have a Chihuahua to save.

01:14:44.593 --> 01:14:46.925
- He's got my collar!
- Yeah, he's got it.

01:14:46.996 --> 01:14:50.261
You did a good thing, Manuel.
You know you did a good thing.

01:14:50.332 --> 01:14:54.029
You're blushing. You're blushing.

01:14:58.073 --> 01:14:59.768
That's Chloe's collar.

01:15:00.843 --> 01:15:04.904
He wants to lead us
to the Chihuahua. Let's go.

01:15:13.722 --> 01:15:17.021
Be careful.
The whole structure is crumbling.

01:15:24.133 --> 01:15:26.601
Rafferty,
there's no sign of the dog.

01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:29.433
Hey, tough guy,
you're lucky I'm locked in.

01:15:29.505 --> 01:15:30.836
Rafferty, come in.

01:15:31.974 --> 01:15:33.339
You look confused.

01:15:33.409 --> 01:15:36.867
Hey, man, where you going?
To find the rest of your tail?

01:15:36.946 --> 01:15:38.573
Rafferty, come in.

01:15:41.217 --> 01:15:45.017
I know you're here, <i>chica.</i>
I can smell you.

01:15:45.087 --> 01:15:47.055
Rafferty, come in, come in.

01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:52.283
- <i>Rafferty.</i>
- Sorry, you're breaking up, boss.

01:15:57.066 --> 01:15:59.091
I'm going to get you now, you rat.

01:16:02.705 --> 01:16:04.297
Hello. One down.

01:16:06.375 --> 01:16:09.742
Rafferty, what's going on?
Talk to me. What's going on?

01:16:09.812 --> 01:16:11.803
- Chloe, you're okay.
- Shhh.

01:16:12.448 --> 01:16:14.348
Come in. I cannot hear you. Come on.

01:16:16.285 --> 01:16:19.550
- Who you been hanging around with?
- Diablo, let's get out...

01:16:20.522 --> 01:16:22.285
- Get them. Get them!
- Run!

01:16:22.358 --> 01:16:23.882
- Follow me!
- We can do it!

01:16:23.959 --> 01:16:27.326
Whoa, you heard the man.
Come on, get me.

01:16:27.396 --> 01:16:28.693
Too slow, gotta go!

01:16:32.568 --> 01:16:34.627
Come here. Come here!

01:16:36.872 --> 01:16:40.399
You better watch out, dog.
I'm going to beat you like a piñata!

01:16:40.476 --> 01:16:42.376
They don't call me
Papi Loco for nothing!

01:16:42.444 --> 01:16:45.174
Come on, little rat. Come on!

01:16:45.748 --> 01:16:47.306
- Whoa!
- Papi!

01:16:47.383 --> 01:16:50.216
Say goodbye to your <i>corazón.</i>

01:16:50.286 --> 01:16:53.619
<i>No... más.</i>

01:16:54.623 --> 01:16:56.750
<i>No más.</i>

01:16:56.825 --> 01:16:57.849
It's over.

01:16:57.927 --> 01:17:00.157
- Chloe!
- <i>No más!</i>

01:17:03.966 --> 01:17:05.831
Wow! That's my bark.

01:17:17.513 --> 01:17:19.037
I barked!

01:17:21.183 --> 01:17:22.707
I barked!

01:17:27.623 --> 01:17:28.817
Two down.

01:17:28.891 --> 01:17:30.290
He's all yours, Officer.

01:17:32.094 --> 01:17:33.527
<i>Señor</i> Vasquez.

01:17:33.595 --> 01:17:35.222
- Did you see that?
- Wow.

01:17:35.297 --> 01:17:36.286
I barked!

01:17:36.365 --> 01:17:39.801
<i>Ai, Mami!</i> Nice set of pipes!

01:17:39.868 --> 01:17:41.893
Run!

01:17:41.971 --> 01:17:44.405
It's time to finish what I started.

01:17:44.473 --> 01:17:46.600
You don't scare me anymore!

01:17:46.675 --> 01:17:48.540
Then why are you shaking?

01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:50.339
Because I am a Chihuahua!

01:17:52.214 --> 01:17:53.408
Diablo!

01:17:54.249 --> 01:17:55.910
Big mistake.

01:17:55.985 --> 01:17:57.680
Leave him alone!

01:17:57.753 --> 01:18:01.348
- Chloe, what are you doing?
- You owe me a cashmere sweater.

01:18:01.423 --> 01:18:03.550
- Hang on, Chloe!
- Kid, hang on.

01:18:03.625 --> 01:18:05.855
- How dare you!
- Chloe, watch out!

01:18:10.933 --> 01:18:13.925
It's over, Diablo! It is over!

01:18:14.003 --> 01:18:16.369
You took everything from me.

01:18:16.438 --> 01:18:19.339
Now, we're even.

01:18:19.441 --> 01:18:20.499
Chloe?

01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:23.940
Mi corazón?

01:18:29.551 --> 01:18:30.609
Kid?

01:18:31.687 --> 01:18:34.520
She's... gone.

01:18:36.191 --> 01:18:37.749
Wake up, <i>mi corazón.</i>

01:18:38.827 --> 01:18:41.990
It's me. Your Papi.

01:18:43.499 --> 01:18:44.625
Speak to me.

01:18:45.401 --> 01:18:48.768
Fill my ears with your beautiful voice.

01:18:49.972 --> 01:18:54.375
Without you, the sun
will have no warmth...

01:18:54.443 --> 01:18:56.741
the flowers, no beauty.

01:18:57.846 --> 01:19:01.680
Chloe, my tail will have no wag.

01:19:02.518 --> 01:19:07.717
Come back to Beverly Hills with me,
and I will tend your garden forever.

01:19:08.757 --> 01:19:12.989
Your love is the rain
that falls upon my earth.

01:19:14.463 --> 01:19:16.988
Don't stop now. It's just getting good.

01:19:17.299 --> 01:19:19.096
<i>Ai Chihuahua!</i>

01:19:19.168 --> 01:19:22.535
Papi, that was beautiful.

01:19:22.604 --> 01:19:25.129
Chloe, you're back. You're back.

01:19:25.207 --> 01:19:26.401
Chloe?

01:19:26.475 --> 01:19:27.806
She's back!

01:19:29.812 --> 01:19:31.143
You're OK.

01:19:32.347 --> 01:19:35.214
Chloe, where have you been?

01:19:36.285 --> 01:19:40.551
Rachel, you missed all the fun.

01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:44.020
You are one tough Chihuahua.

01:19:44.093 --> 01:19:47.085
Tiny but mighty.

01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:48.561
Hi, Chloe.

01:19:51.133 --> 01:19:53.158
Hi. Hi.

01:20:12.754 --> 01:20:15.552
So you're the... guard dog.

01:20:16.191 --> 01:20:19.388
No, man. I'm a landscaper.

01:20:19.761 --> 01:20:22.389
- Oops.
- Right.

01:20:23.098 --> 01:20:24.759
Well, <i>adiós,</i> kid.

01:20:25.534 --> 01:20:27.627
Oh, uh... Delgado.

01:20:27.703 --> 01:20:31.867
You know,
Vivian could still use a guard dog.

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:36.104
Thanks for the offer,
but someone has to go after El Diablo.

01:20:36.178 --> 01:20:41.047
Besides, <i>princesa,</i> I think you
can take care of things yourself now.

01:20:41.483 --> 01:20:43.508
I'll miss you.

01:20:43.585 --> 01:20:47.817
Yeah, I'll miss you, too, kid.
But this isn't goodbye.

01:20:48.724 --> 01:20:50.851
I'm sure we'll be
seeing each other again.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.662
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.

01:21:03.338 --> 01:21:06.171
Maybe you could use
a little extra help on the force.

01:21:09.244 --> 01:21:11.405
Where do you think
you are going, officer?

01:21:25.027 --> 01:21:26.619
Ready to get back on the job?

01:21:28.697 --> 01:21:30.187
Officer!

01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:37.668
Yeah. Good boy. Good boy.

01:21:43.111 --> 01:21:45.739
Chloe! Papi! Let's go home.

01:21:46.215 --> 01:21:48.240
We gotta get home before Aunt Viv does.

01:21:49.952 --> 01:21:51.385
Hey, come here.

01:21:52.955 --> 01:21:54.980
Goodbye, my friends.

01:21:56.525 --> 01:22:00.484
- <i>Adiós, amigo.</i>
- <i> Adiós,</i> kid.

01:22:00.562 --> 01:22:02.621
<i>Muchas gracias,</i> Delgado.

01:22:04.032 --> 01:22:08.799
Thank you, Chloe.
I've never had a friend like you.

01:22:13.175 --> 01:22:16.702
Great, she's not home yet.
She'll be here any minute.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.114
- Can you get the bags?
- Yeah, I'll get the bags.

01:22:21.183 --> 01:22:23.481
- I'll put her in the tub.
- Go, go, go.

01:22:23.552 --> 01:22:24.541
Hurry up!

01:22:25.687 --> 01:22:27.348
Come on. We're going to make it.

01:22:29.157 --> 01:22:30.556
Oh-oh. Think fast, <i>amigo.</i>

01:22:35.464 --> 01:22:38.797
Hi! How are you? Welcome.

01:22:38.867 --> 01:22:43.201
- Welcome. Hi.
- What a surprise. Hello.

01:22:43.272 --> 01:22:46.139
I took photographs
of the most wonderful gardens.

01:22:46.208 --> 01:22:49.268
You're not going to believe.
First, I want to go see Chloe.

01:22:49.344 --> 01:22:53.747
- Actually, I need you to see something.
- That's the best you can do?

01:22:53.815 --> 01:22:56.750
- Something you're gonna love.
- Should I bite her leg?

01:22:56.818 --> 01:23:00.618
By the way, you look exhausted.
You've been working too hard.

01:23:00.689 --> 01:23:04.216
Chloe? Chloe.

01:23:04.293 --> 01:23:06.659
- Sam, put my bags over there, please?
- Yes.

01:23:06.728 --> 01:23:10.391
Chloe? Rachel?

01:23:10.465 --> 01:23:13.559
- Hi, Aunt Viv.
- Hi.

01:23:13.635 --> 01:23:15.432
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:23:17.673 --> 01:23:19.334
Your hair is all wet.

01:23:20.008 --> 01:23:21.805
I was in a bath.

01:23:21.877 --> 01:23:25.643
- Oh. Where's my Chloe?
- There she is.

01:23:26.348 --> 01:23:28.213
Hi, sweetheart.

01:23:29.184 --> 01:23:32.950
Hi. Come here.
Hi, sweetheart.

01:23:34.056 --> 01:23:37.685
My baby girl. My sweet angel.

01:23:37.759 --> 01:23:39.727
I missed you so much. I did.

01:23:39.795 --> 01:23:41.160
Yes, I did.

01:23:41.897 --> 01:23:44.730
What's that smell? What's that...

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:49.362
It's sort of... urban and...

01:23:49.438 --> 01:23:53.602
kind of earthy... and it's fabulous.

01:23:53.675 --> 01:23:55.700
That's Mexico No. 5.

01:23:57.879 --> 01:24:01.872
I can't believe I'm running over
a pond in my best dress.

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:06.080
So does this mean you're no longer a
prissy Beverly Hills Chihuahua?

01:24:06.154 --> 01:24:10.284
Beverly Hills, <i>sí.</i> Prissy,
<i>no más.</i>

01:24:10.992 --> 01:24:14.860
How do you say "What are you doing
on Friday night" in Spanish?

01:24:22.437 --> 01:24:25.929
Me? Nothing. And you?

01:24:26.007 --> 01:24:29.568
- <i>Nada.</i>
- <i>Bueno,</i> let's...

01:24:29.644 --> 01:24:32.238
After the way I treated you,

01:24:32.314 --> 01:24:35.511
I can't believe you came after me.

01:24:35.584 --> 01:24:37.347
How could I not?

01:24:43.892 --> 01:24:47.089
I think I'm... going to cry.

01:24:51.466 --> 01:24:54.196
Oh, Chloe.

01:24:54.269 --> 01:24:57.534
Papi likes.

01:25:03.779 --> 01:25:05.713
<i> In case</i>
<i>you were wondering,</i> amigos.

01:25:05.781 --> 01:25:10.684
<i>Delgado received the medal of honor for</i>
<i>capturing his archnemesis, El Diablo.</i>

01:25:10.752 --> 01:25:12.845
<i>Shortly after entering the pound,</i>

01:25:12.921 --> 01:25:17.824
<i>El Diablo was adopted by a rich lady</i>
<i>with a passion for fashion.</i>

01:25:19.261 --> 01:25:23.925
<i>Rafa became the official</i>
<i>spokesdog for Minty Mutt.</i>

01:25:23.999 --> 01:25:27.332
<i>For that doggy fresh breath</i>
<i>all day long.</i>

01:25:28.403 --> 01:25:30.963
<i>Bimini, Sebastian, and Delta</i>
<i>landed a dream spot</i>

01:25:31.039 --> 01:25:33.473
<i>on TV's hottest new reality show,</i>

01:25:33.542 --> 01:25:36.875
So You Think You Can Prance. Hey!

01:25:37.579 --> 01:25:40.412
<i>Chico and Manuel</i>
<i>stowed away to Beverly Hills...</i>

01:25:40.482 --> 01:25:42.973
<i>where they learned</i>
<i>a new English word...</i>

01:25:44.186 --> 01:25:45.949
<i>..."bling."</i>

01:25:46.021 --> 01:25:48.751
<i>This was Chloe and
me on our first date.</i>

01:25:48.824 --> 01:25:53.227
<i>And who knows? Maybe there are</i>
<i>a few</i> taquitos <i>in our future.</i>

01:25:53.295 --> 01:25:56.890
<i>Let's just say</i>
mi corazón <i>puts the "wow" in...</i>

01:25:56.965 --> 01:25:58.364
<i>... Chihuahua!</i>
