00:12.546 --> 00:14.513
(lively guitar music)

00:19.387 --> 00:22.221
¶ I'm just a window
you can see through ¶

00:22.223 --> 00:23.722
¶ You are a rock

00:23.724 --> 00:26.358
¶ Patient named a
tank after you ¶

00:26.360 --> 00:31.230
¶ And leave a pillow
there I can lay my head ¶

00:32.466 --> 00:35.267
¶ But I must confess
I got us in a mess ¶

00:35.269 --> 00:38.337
¶ And I know I said this

00:38.339 --> 00:40.272
¶ Would never ever
happen to us ¶

00:40.274 --> 00:43.308
¶ I meant it then

00:43.310 --> 00:47.346
¶ Oh please remember

00:47.348 --> 00:49.648
¶ Days

00:49.650 --> 00:53.285
¶ When I used to chase you

00:53.287 --> 00:56.155
¶ And sing
(man yelling)

00:56.157 --> 01:00.092
¶ I think this is magic

01:00.094 --> 01:01.593
¶ It's a little bit tragic

01:01.595 --> 01:05.097
¶ I'd give away
everything I have ¶

01:05.099 --> 01:08.534
¶ Just for a love from you

01:08.536 --> 01:11.403
¶ And you are amazing

01:11.405 --> 01:14.373
¶ And maybe just a
little bit crazy ¶

01:14.375 --> 01:17.376
¶ I'd trade all the
gold, it is worth it ¶

01:17.378 --> 01:20.746
¶ Just to be with you

01:20.748 --> 01:25.617
¶ Just to be with you

01:28.556 --> 01:31.457
¶ You deserve a
much smoother ride ¶

01:31.459 --> 01:34.460
¶ You should have
a whole big sky ¶

01:34.462 --> 01:39.331
¶ And every single star that
it holds shines in the night ¶

01:40.701 --> 01:43.702
¶ I notice lately
you've been blue ¶

01:43.704 --> 01:47.739
¶ And all I can say is
every little piece of me ¶

01:47.741 --> 01:52.377
¶ Loves every little
single thing about you ¶

01:52.379 --> 01:55.747
¶ Oh please remember

01:55.749 --> 01:58.684
¶ The days

01:58.686 --> 02:02.321
¶ When I used to chase you

02:02.323 --> 02:05.257
¶ And sing

02:05.259 --> 02:07.693
¶ I think this is magic

02:07.695 --> 02:10.529
¶ Maybe just a
little bit tragic ¶

02:10.531 --> 02:13.699
¶ I'd give away
everything I have ¶

02:13.701 --> 02:17.636
¶ Just for a little
love from you ¶

02:17.638 --> 02:20.472
¶ But you are amazing

02:20.474 --> 02:23.475
¶ And maybe just a
little bit crazy ¶

02:23.477 --> 02:26.645
¶ I'd trade all the gold
in this world babe ¶

02:26.647 --> 02:29.515
¶ Just to be with you

02:29.517 --> 02:34.386
¶ Just to be with you

02:36.790 --> 02:39.358
¶ I think this is magic

02:39.360 --> 02:42.294
¶ And maybe just a
little bit tragic ¶

02:42.296 --> 02:45.297
¶ I'd give away
everything I have ¶

02:45.299 --> 02:49.334
¶ Just for a little
love from you ¶

02:49.336 --> 02:51.670
¶ But you are amazing
(woman laughing)

02:51.672 --> 02:54.439
¶ And maybe just a
little bit crazy ¶

02:54.441 --> 02:57.843
¶ I'd trade all the gold
in this world babe ¶

02:57.845 --> 03:00.879
¶ Just to be with you

03:00.881 --> 03:03.916
¶ Just to be with you

03:13.260 --> 03:16.795
(woman groaning and crying)

03:33.414 --> 03:35.314
- Oh Daddy, thank you.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.817
I wanted that pony so badly.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.721
Sweet little paint.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.928
(phone ringing)

03:49.930 --> 03:50.829
Oh.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.473
(gentle music)

04:03.444 --> 04:05.978
(phone buzzing)

04:15.289 --> 04:18.490
(woman clearing throat)

04:19.827 --> 04:21.493
Hello, Mr. Houston.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.331
Oh, he was that all right.

04:27.835 --> 04:31.336
I'm fine, I'm really,
really doing well over here.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.006
Stronger than ever.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.509
But you know Daddy, I mean,

04:37.511 --> 04:39.578
he always had to
have the last say,

04:40.514 --> 04:41.813
right up till the end.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.956
You know he insisted on
having a chicken fried steak

04:50.958 --> 04:53.925
and a chicken fried
chicken for lunch.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.862
It was the damnedest thing.

04:56.864 --> 05:01.366
He wasn't acting off,
just a little sentimental.

05:01.368 --> 05:03.302
He got up and he
said something nice

05:03.304 --> 05:05.404
about each and every
one of us and then...

05:07.508 --> 05:09.541
He just said he was
going to a better place

05:09.543 --> 05:13.879
and see us on down the road.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.581
We didn't know he
meant that way.

05:16.583 --> 05:20.085
(man hacking and coughing)

05:21.588 --> 05:24.022
Well, thank you, Mr.
Houston, God bless you, too.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.424
Take care, bye.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.496
You're not getting sick
on me, are you, Juan?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.965
Juan, are you okay?

05:33.967 --> 05:35.400
- I'm good, JA!

05:35.402 --> 05:37.703
Just mosquitoes, damn
mosquitoes everywhere,

05:37.705 --> 05:38.937
just fumigating.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.541
- Well, don't breathe
the damn Deet.

05:42.543 --> 05:46.545
You know it's full
of the cancer.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.447
I can't handle losing you too.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.350
- I'm taking every precaution.

05:52.553 --> 05:56.121
(gentle acoustic guitar music)

06:06.934 --> 06:10.635
(singing in foreign language)

06:19.613 --> 06:21.380
Jenny!
- Hey there, Don Juan.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.415
- Haha, very funny.
- I don't get it.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.084
- You're like the greatest guy.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.920
Seriously, when are you gonna
find yourself a girlfriend?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.155
Aren't you lonely?

06:30.157 --> 06:33.125
- How do you know I
don't have one already?

06:33.127 --> 06:34.793
- Juan, do you?

06:34.795 --> 06:36.628
- Look at you, cute as a
button and I've yet to hear

06:36.630 --> 06:38.530
or see anything about
a boyfriend yet.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.700
- I sort of am

06:41.702 --> 06:44.770
seeing this guy, it's
just, I don't know.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.072
Let's just say if
certain people found out,

06:47.074 --> 06:48.673
I'd be in deep ca-ca.

06:48.675 --> 06:51.143
He's like forbidden
fruit, it sucks.

06:51.145 --> 06:54.579
- I'm sorry, I know it's
tough being your age.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.981
- Thanks.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.149
How's Mom today?

06:57.151 --> 06:59.518
- She's doing that
wine thingamajig again.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.120
- With the straws, oh man.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.856
- I'm really worried
about her this time.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.158
I mean, she didn't
see this one coming.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.560
I wanna help her.

07:09.663 --> 07:10.729
I love your mom so much.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.131
I always have.

07:15.169 --> 07:18.170
Well, like a
cousin, or a sister.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.740
Or the Virgin of Guadeloupe.
(chuckling)

07:21.742 --> 07:23.074
- She's no virgin.

07:24.745 --> 07:28.814
It's like you're her best
friend, her spiritual leader,

07:28.816 --> 07:32.050
her psychoanalyst,
and her gardener.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.853
You do more for her than anyone.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.223
I don't know what
she'd do without you.

07:38.225 --> 07:42.027
- (laughing) Hey Juan,
boy, am I glad to see you.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.195
Hey, you give me
a hand, brother?

07:43.197 --> 07:44.095
- Sure.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.669
Hello, Jenny darling,
how you doing, baby girl?

07:50.671 --> 07:51.870
- I'm good, Pops.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.038
Nice of you to
finally come home.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.005
It'll take the heat off me.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.707
- Welcome back, Jimmy.

07:55.709 --> 07:56.708
- Gracias, Juan.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.009
Well, how are we doing?

07:58.011 --> 07:59.678
You two hanging in there?

07:59.680 --> 08:00.612
- Yeah.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.780
- She any better?

08:01.782 --> 08:03.748
- She's still very sad.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.116
She needs you.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.985
- I know.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.988
I know my running off going
fishing didn't help, either.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.756
- Not the most
compassionate way to console

08:11.758 --> 08:13.024
your grieving wife.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.260
- I didn't just
go to go fishing.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.896
Hell, Papo dying like
that, it hit me hard, man,

08:17.898 --> 08:19.030
scared the shit out of me.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.934
I mean, how am I gonna
fill the shoes of such a,

08:24.037 --> 08:27.038
the boots of such
an amazing man?

08:27.975 --> 08:29.508
- Those are big boots to fill.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.512
Hey, alligator or snake skin?

08:34.248 --> 08:37.649
- (chuckling) Alligator!
- Alligator!

08:37.651 --> 08:39.284
- I fished the Flato
Cut on Thursday.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.220
Reds were tailing, drum
were running the channel.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.655
The trout were hitting
those crazy trolleys

08:43.657 --> 08:44.890
like there was no tomorrow.

08:46.593 --> 08:47.626
I swear, I could feel

08:49.096 --> 08:51.663
Papo was with me
the whole damn time,

08:51.665 --> 08:53.765
hootin', hollerin'
about my horseshit cast,

08:53.767 --> 08:55.834
tellin' me which
fly to put on next.

08:57.604 --> 08:58.870
It was like I could hear every
word he was about to say,

08:58.872 --> 09:00.839
man, I knew what was coming.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.542
It was the best damn day
of fishing my entire life.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.178
But it wasn't about the fishing.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.884
I just needed some time
to, to say goodbye,

09:14.121 --> 09:15.220
my own way.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.690
Can you imagine picking
the day you die?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.191
It's the damnedest
thing I ever saw.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.195
- He was a blessed
and fearless man.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.566
- Hey, give me a beer.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.670
Girl, who taught you how
to do this, good God.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.170
- Gross.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.807
- Would you rather eat
a plate of dog shit

09:35.809 --> 09:37.742
or be six feet under?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.177
- Eat a plate of dog shit.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.979
- Gross.
- Exactly.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.847
- That's exactly what he asked
me when I was being indicted

09:42.849 --> 09:44.683
by the Railroad Commission.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.351
He says,

09:46.353 --> 09:49.321
"Would you rather be six feet
under or be investigated?"

09:49.323 --> 09:50.889
I said investigated.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.825
And then he says, "Well,
would you rather eat a plate

09:53.827 --> 09:55.727
"of dog shit or
be investigated?"

09:56.897 --> 09:58.263
I said I guess investigated.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.366
And then he says,

10:03.003 --> 10:05.270
"Well, what the hell
you worked up for, boy?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.605
"You're on the right
side of the dirt.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.206
"You ain't even
eating dog shit."

10:09.142 --> 10:11.176
- What's your point, Dad?

10:11.178 --> 10:13.011
- The point is that
where you're at in life

10:13.013 --> 10:14.913
is a matter of perspective.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.615
Hell, compared to
being six feet under

10:16.617 --> 10:18.617
or eating a plate of dog shit,
everything is fine with me.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.687
That old man taught me
about everything I know.

10:22.689 --> 10:25.991
Oil business, cattle
business, women, droughts,

10:25.993 --> 10:27.626
raising kids.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.296
Hell, he always treated
me like I was someone.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.733
Even before I was.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.003
Hey, I'm gonna
sneak me in a shower

10:38.005 --> 10:40.038
and then I'm gonna head to
Austin, watch the 'Horns play

10:40.040 --> 10:42.140
in lieu of an
old-fashioned ass chewing.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.808
I just can't take
that right now.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.745
I'm sensitive, Juan.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.380
- Boy, you are
living dangerously.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.348
- I'll catch you on
the flipside, kiddo.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.083
- Bye, Pops.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.887
(gentle acoustic guitar music)

11:03.196 --> 11:08.266
¶ Doesn't help that
I couldn't play ¶

11:09.403 --> 11:13.405
¶ I made more than
a few mistakes ¶

11:13.407 --> 11:16.074
¶ I know

11:16.076 --> 11:17.275
- I'm lying.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.911
You know damn well
we're not separated.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.414
- Well, it was the only
justification I could fathom

11:22.416 --> 11:25.083
for him being with
an early 30s blonde.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.419
He had flowers and all.

11:27.421 --> 11:30.889
She drove a beautiful blue BMW.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.791
- Early 30s blonde?

11:32.793 --> 11:36.428
Look, I don't care who your
cousin is on the first floor.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.930
Jimmy loves me and
he went fishing.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.232
- Of course he did.

11:41.234 --> 11:44.102
But he did some
other things, too.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.904
- Jimmy can hardly get it up.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.473
He's half drunk most of the
day and eating the rest.

11:48.475 --> 11:52.110
- I am just telling you
what people are saying.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.411
We are just so concerned.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.982
- So you're trying to
tell me that my husband

11:57.984 --> 11:59.317
is cheating on me?

11:59.319 --> 12:01.920
You are chock full of it today.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.290
Why don't you just
tell your cousin

12:06.860 --> 12:10.228
that I've just buried my father

12:10.230 --> 12:13.064
and to mind her
own damn business.

12:13.066 --> 12:17.502
And you too, you, oh,
you just catty bitch.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.071
(woman gasps)

12:28.749 --> 12:33.418
(gentle acoustic guitar music)
(woman wailing)

12:49.536 --> 12:50.969
- Have you seen my sunglasses?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.170
I swear I'm losing my mind.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.472
I think I threw
them in the trash

12:54.474 --> 12:55.340
with my wadded burger bag.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.377
(woman sobbing)

13:00.914 --> 13:03.414
Oh, oh hey, it's okay.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.485
Oh now, it's gonna be all right.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.389
We all miss Papo, baby.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.559
It'll get better with
time, you'll see.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.794
Hey come on.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.964
You know he wouldn't want to
see you this way over him.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.533
You know how he was.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.802
- It's not about that.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.203
- Okay, that again?

13:26.940 --> 13:30.108
JA, how many times are you
gonna beat me up over that?

13:32.445 --> 13:33.945
It was just a fling.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.446
Might have been old, but
he still had it in him.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.049
You know how he was.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.118
Well now look, your mama's gone.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.419
He was lonely, so was I.

13:43.223 --> 13:46.257
Well, if it makes you feel
better, I wasn't even drunk.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.059
- It's not about that either.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.228
- Well, then, what is it?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.597
Holy moly, I haven't
seen you this way

13:52.599 --> 13:56.134
since Martha Mayberry took
your lead in the senior play.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.871
Honey, if it's not your
daddy, then what is it?

13:59.873 --> 14:01.506
- It's Jimmy.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.077
- (gasps) Oh my God.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.613
First your mama, then
your daddy, now Jimmy?

14:08.615 --> 14:12.050
Oh baby, oh my
God, what's he got?

14:12.052 --> 14:13.585
I mean, how long, six months?

14:13.587 --> 14:15.086
Three? One?

14:16.223 --> 14:19.123
Oh baby, I'm so sorry.
- Oh God!

14:19.125 --> 14:22.861
- But, but, but he
looks so healthy.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.195
I don't know...

14:24.197 --> 14:27.332
- He's not dying,
he's having an affair.

14:28.134 --> 14:31.870
- Jimmy, oh there is no way.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.638
- Yes there is.

14:33.640 --> 14:38.376
According to your nosy Junior
League friend Elaine Narswell.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.480
Oh, he was shacked up with
some blonde at Pines Landing.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.450
He said he was gonna go
down there to go fishing.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.486
Well, evidently he just
went on that little woman

14:48.488 --> 14:51.422
until he caught
something real fishy.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.459
- Baby, you know what, you
cared more about that damn house

14:54.461 --> 14:55.393
than your own husband.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.397
When's the last time
you gave him a blowjob?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.432
(woman sputtering)

15:01.434 --> 15:05.103
- God, you have the mouth
of a drunken roughneck.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.304
- You don't remember?

15:08.541 --> 15:11.943
Oh my God, you're sitting
here crying your eyes out

15:11.945 --> 15:14.379
about your man sleeping
with another woman

15:14.381 --> 15:16.447
and you can't
remember the last time

15:16.449 --> 15:19.384
you gave him a blowjob?

15:19.386 --> 15:22.387
What do you care if he's
getting some somewhere else?

15:22.389 --> 15:25.423
Okay, you know what, this
is a waste of my time.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.958
I'm outta here.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.960
- I'm not frigid.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.062
Don't you remember Jamaica?

15:31.064 --> 15:34.365
- Did you just say Jamaica?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.034
Lord, how old are we?

15:37.037 --> 15:40.538
That was 25 years ago.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.374
You gave it up the first
night to two strangers at once

15:43.376 --> 15:45.476
while you're making
Jimmy wait for some.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.112
Now he's waiting again.

15:48.114 --> 15:52.216
That is a lifetime of sexual
manipulation there, sweetheart.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.718
- How would you know?

15:53.720 --> 15:57.455
- Oh honey, listen to me,
men are simple and easy.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.958
Fill their belly and fill
your britches, girlfriend.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.226
That's how you keep a man.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.662
Hell, your mama
taught me that one.

16:04.664 --> 16:08.132
More goodwill has been
done on this earth

16:08.134 --> 16:11.102
by a simple blowjob
than anything else.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.470
These lips do not lie!

16:12.472 --> 16:15.974
- Jamaica, blowjobs,
I want in on this.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.142
Hey Aunt Sallie.
- Hey babe.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.477
- Where do I sign up?
- Oh.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.647
- Oh, let's take a selfie.
- Oh, sure thing.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.316
- That's cute.
- Totally.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.151
- I'll put it on my Instagram.
- Tag me.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.454
- So, what are
y'all talking about?

16:29.456 --> 16:31.422
- About a movie I saw.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.324
- Sounds like my kind of movie.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.293
I've never been to
Jamaica, but blowjobs,

16:35.295 --> 16:37.195
on the other hand, I
know what you mean.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.330
Guys will do anything for them.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.500
- Jenny, watch your mouth.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.303
- While I'm giving a
blowjob, like in the mirror?

16:45.305 --> 16:46.771
Sounds hot.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.040
I bet guys would go hog
wild when it comes to that.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.310
- When it comes to that, ha!

16:53.680 --> 16:55.079
Your daughter is a hoot!

16:55.081 --> 16:57.615
- All that I need is
my floozie friend being

16:57.617 --> 17:01.386
the guiding light for my sweet
and innocent little baby.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.754
- Have y'all seen Anthony?
- Huh uh.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.322
- Did he come back yet?
- Mm-mm.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.157
- Well, let him know
I'm looking for him.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.759
- Okay.

17:07.761 --> 17:11.162
- And if you need any
blowjob lessons, let me know.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.764
- Jenny!

17:12.766 --> 17:15.199
- See, even your daughter
knows the importance

17:15.201 --> 17:17.068
of a proper blowjob.

17:17.070 --> 17:21.339
- I have not had a decent
conversation with her in months.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.707
You've tainted her.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.076
She hates me.

17:25.078 --> 17:28.279
- I'm just trying to
keep her in touch with,

17:28.281 --> 17:31.349
well, with her
feminine emotions.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.084
I think somebody has to.

17:33.086 --> 17:37.221
- More like in touch with
every boy's privates.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.557
- Okay, don't snap
my garters, honey.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.393
At least when I get a man, I
keep him till I'm finished.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.761
- Shut up.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.197
- Jimmy always did love you.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.465
Don't ask me why.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.402
Oh hell, it's probably so
he could hang out with Papo.

17:52.539 --> 17:56.441
- So low you have to
look up to see hell.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.142
- That was a good one.

17:58.144 --> 18:01.212
- I might not have shown
him lovin' like you would.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.215
But I love him.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.484
I do.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.487
I love him.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.122
- I know you do.

18:11.124 --> 18:14.625
I'm sorry, baby, I
shouldn't have said that.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.360
It's just that, you know,
sometimes I don't think

18:16.362 --> 18:18.663
you realize how good you got it.

18:18.665 --> 18:22.633
I mean, you got a beautiful
family, a big old house.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.770
And Jenny, well,
she's growing up fast.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.338
That's what little girls do.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.476
- I'm so, so sorry, senora.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.578
I should have come
and told you myself.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.580
I just didn't know what to do.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.783
I didn't think Sallie was
going to say anything.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.719
- What do you mean, Juan?

18:43.223 --> 18:44.823
- The only thing I
really know is just

18:44.824 --> 18:46.424
about the pregnancy
test in the trash.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.359
- Whose trash?

18:49.129 --> 18:51.329
- Jenny's trash?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.431
- Sallie, what do
you know about this?

18:53.433 --> 18:55.433
- I haven't the slightest.
- Sallie?

18:55.435 --> 18:57.668
- I was just looking
for my glasses.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.737
- Oh my God Juan.

18:59.739 --> 19:03.508
- Well, it was probably broken.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.343
- Oh come on, Juan.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.512
- It was probably the
neighbor's, that little slut.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.346
- Oh come on, Juan.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.514
- I don't know.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.850
It was a positive
pregnancy test.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.686
That's all I know, I swear.

19:15.688 --> 19:20.558
- Oh my God I didn't even
know she had a boyfriend.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.261
My own daughter isn't
confiding in me?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.197
Oh my God I am losing my mind.

19:26.199 --> 19:29.367
No, I am losing my mind.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.903
First those damn barking
dogs at the new house.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.738
I can't sleep for days.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.439
Then the last lunch,

19:35.441 --> 19:38.476
and Papo doesn't even
tell me he's dying.

19:40.246 --> 19:43.247
And then the fucking Jimmy
fucking hookers and now,

19:43.249 --> 19:46.350
oh yeah, Jenny is pregnant?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.818
Are you kidding me?

19:47.820 --> 19:52.690
Oh my God, oh my life is nothing
but a shitstorm of liars,

19:53.526 --> 19:55.393
whores, and addicts.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.361
- Take a few deep
breaths, senora.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.863
- That's a good idea.
- Come on, take a deep breath.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.399
- I'm gonna get you
some water, okay?

20:01.401 --> 20:02.984
- That's a good idea.
- My God, Juan,

20:02.985 --> 20:04.568
you are the only
one I can count on.

20:11.244 --> 20:11.943
- Um...

20:15.415 --> 20:17.248
What about me?

20:17.250 --> 20:18.749
You know what your problem is?

20:18.751 --> 20:21.419
You never appreciate
those around you.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.853
I've had enough.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.957
I am out of here, Grandma.
- No you're not going anywhere

20:25.959 --> 20:28.960
until you tell me that you know.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.695
- I can't repeat it.

20:30.697 --> 20:35.266
- You (laughing) never had
any problem repeating anything

20:35.268 --> 20:37.935
you have ever thought, heard,

20:37.937 --> 20:41.305
conceived, contrived,
or hallucinated.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.574
- Oh.
- So you're gonna tell me

20:43.576 --> 20:45.710
what you know right now,

20:45.712 --> 20:49.714
or I'm gonna banish contact
with you for two years.

20:49.716 --> 20:54.585
- (laughs) Oh Lord, that
was the stupidest thing

20:55.388 --> 20:56.287
you ever did.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.756
You know what, go
ahead, banish me.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.258
See ya in two years.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.859
- Stop!
- What?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.494
- Just tell me what you know!

21:04.497 --> 21:06.430
- Apologize.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.299
- For what?

21:08.301 --> 21:10.635
- For your stupid
banishing crap.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.672
Take your tits out of the dirt

21:14.674 --> 21:18.943
and start celebrating life
for the miracle it is.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.013
What would Papo say?

21:22.815 --> 21:24.448
All this bellyaching.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.951
Hell, what would your mama do?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.419
You know what she'd say?

21:28.421 --> 21:30.521
She'd say, "Take your
lumps and move on."

21:34.027 --> 21:38.896
- I'll apologize if you
just tell me what you heard.

21:42.969 --> 21:43.868
- Deal.

21:46.873 --> 21:50.074
(both women stammering)

21:53.980 --> 21:56.614
- I'm sorry.
- Aw, you did it,

21:56.616 --> 21:58.582
good job, sweetie!

21:58.584 --> 22:00.584
Oh, that wasn't so bad, was it?

22:00.586 --> 22:02.553
It kinda felt good, didn't it?

22:02.555 --> 22:05.856
You know, it's kinda cleansing
to sort of wrap your arms

22:05.858 --> 22:08.559
around your failures, isn't it?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.928
- It's just like you, just
give you a small victory

22:10.930 --> 22:13.597
and there you are just
basking in the sun,

22:13.599 --> 22:14.699
glowing in your win.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.000
It's okay, Sallie.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.735
What is it?

22:19.372 --> 22:23.074
- Oh, well, I don't
think it's true.

22:23.076 --> 22:26.544
- I don't care true or not, I
need to know now, so I can--

22:26.546 --> 22:27.845
- But it's just hearsay!
- I don't care

22:27.847 --> 22:29.347
if it's hearsay, tell me know,

22:29.349 --> 22:31.415
I don't wanna know next
week or next month.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.517
- Jenny and Anthony
are secretly dating.

22:36.789 --> 22:37.688
- Jenny

22:39.726 --> 22:40.458
and Anthony?

22:43.996 --> 22:46.997
No, they're brother and sister!

22:46.999 --> 22:50.000
- Well, technically
stepbrother and stepsister.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.736
They're not genetically related.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.505
So hey, if you want to look
on the bright side of this,

22:54.507 --> 22:56.907
it could make for a
lovely small wedding.

22:56.909 --> 23:00.611
- Oh my God, it's my fault.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.781
I let them take baths
together when they were kids.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.616
Oh my God, no, they wouldn't.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.551
They know it would kill me.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.587
What will people say?

23:09.589 --> 23:11.455
- Oh, a lot.

23:11.457 --> 23:13.758
- Oh my God, this isn't
real, this isn't true,

23:13.760 --> 23:16.093
this must be a dream. (laughs)

23:17.764 --> 23:21.732
Yeah, this is a dream,
this is a dream, oh my God,

23:21.734 --> 23:24.101
this is just a dream.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.804
This isn't a dream,
this is a nightmare.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.606
This is a nightmare that
I need to wake up from.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.508
- Okay, well, wake
up, wake up, wake up!

23:30.510 --> 23:34.445
Wake up!
- No, you made up this gossip.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.146
- Listen to me.

23:36.449 --> 23:39.650
Debra Perkins' daughter
Baker is a Kappa

23:39.652 --> 23:40.818
in Jenny's pledge class.

23:42.155 --> 23:44.789
They share a bathroom
and she overheard her

23:44.791 --> 23:46.891
telling her roommate
about how, um,

23:46.893 --> 23:48.826
she's in love with Anthony.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.096
How it's like he's
forbidden fruit.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.597
- Forbidden fruit?

23:53.599 --> 23:55.433
- She made her promise
to keep it a secret.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.601
- Keep it a secret?

23:57.603 --> 23:58.536
- Well, you know how secrets
travel in the Kappa house.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.004
- Oh my God, the Kappa house.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.972
- Probably in Oklahoma by now.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.541
- What's in Oklahoma?

24:03.543 --> 24:04.442
- Oh!

24:05.845 --> 24:07.845
- Hey Sallie, how you doing?
- Hey babe, how you doing?

24:07.847 --> 24:09.513
- You're getting fit.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.102
- Jeanne Anne?

24:15.103 --> 24:16.085
I'm sorry, I know you're mad,

24:16.088 --> 24:19.957
but I just had to get
away, clear my mind.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.530
I had the most amazing
fishing trip of my life.

24:26.532 --> 24:29.233
Papo was there, he
brought me luck.

24:30.536 --> 24:32.503
This is probably
bad timing, too,

24:32.505 --> 24:34.738
but would y'all like to
come with me to Austin,

24:34.740 --> 24:36.240
watch the 'Horns play KSU?

24:36.242 --> 24:37.975
I got two extra tickets,
it's gonna be a good game.

24:37.977 --> 24:38.876
- No.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.812
- Sallie, what do you say?

24:41.814 --> 24:44.048
- Oh, I've got all the
entertainment I can handle

24:44.050 --> 24:46.150
right here, but you go on,

24:46.152 --> 24:47.585
have yourself a good
time at that game.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.553
- Well, I would invite
Jenny or Anthony,

24:49.555 --> 24:50.988
but I can't find them anywhere.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.857
You know those two,
probably off messing around

24:52.859 --> 24:54.525
with each other,
getting into trouble.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.827
Juan, 'Horns game?
- Yeah, man!

24:56.829 --> 24:59.196
- Juan doesn't wanna
go, he has work to do.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.232
- Found you a bottle of Tito's.

25:01.234 --> 25:03.000
You are a gentleman and a saint.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.604
- Guess I have more
sweeping to do.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.241
- Come on, girls,
join me tonight.

25:10.243 --> 25:12.042
We'll have some fun, shit,

25:12.044 --> 25:13.944
I'm just blowing
off a little steam.

25:15.581 --> 25:16.814
All right, I tried.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.217
Hate to run, but if I'm
gonna make the tipoff.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.852
- Drive safe, babe.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.956
- Can you believe him?

25:25.958 --> 25:27.958
"Come on, girls, go
to the 'Horns game.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.594
"I'm just gonna
blow off some team."

25:30.596 --> 25:32.596
- Well, you need to
be home with him.

25:32.598 --> 25:35.599
Well damn, if he's
lying, boy is he good.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.034
Hell, he's almost as good as me.

25:38.604 --> 25:41.605
You know, babe, don't
you worry about all this.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.073
It's all gonna be fine.

25:43.075 --> 25:46.310
Look, you got your health,
you got your friends.

25:46.312 --> 25:50.080
- Hey Mama, hey Aunt Sallie.
- Hey babe.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.782
- Hey Sallie.
- Hey.

25:53.719 --> 25:54.985
- You okay?

25:54.987 --> 25:56.220
- Hey, how was the coast?

25:56.222 --> 25:58.155
I heard you went
down there with Dad.

25:58.156 --> 26:00.089
- Oh, no hon, not me,
I've been right here.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.325
- That's strange.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.960
My friend Tiger said
he saw a hot blonde

26:02.962 --> 26:04.028
leaving the house with Dad.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.030
I just figured it was you.

26:06.032 --> 26:08.032
- No, must've been,

26:08.034 --> 26:11.335
I guess a neighbor or something.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.571
- Yeah, a hot neighbor
I don't know about.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.172
- Oh (chuckles) good point.

26:17.009 --> 26:20.311
So, how are you doing, Anthony?

26:20.313 --> 26:22.780
- I'm missing Papo,
so used to seeing him

26:22.782 --> 26:24.782
out at the ranch.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.085
It's kinda like
he's still there.

26:28.087 --> 26:32.289
In another pasture,
better place you know.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.291
Dad, Tiger and I, we're
going out there tomorrow

26:34.293 --> 26:35.225
to go hunting.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.128
- Okay, now who is this Tiger?

26:38.130 --> 26:40.798
- Tiger's my fraternity brother.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.133
Two hoots and a
holler, true romantic,

26:43.135 --> 26:45.035
like myself.
- Oh.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.106
- How you hanging in there, JA?

26:49.108 --> 26:51.675
- I'm about at my
wits' end, son.

26:51.677 --> 26:53.911
- I know how you feel.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.179
I mean, I sorta do.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.950
I just can't imagine
losing you or dad

27:00.953 --> 27:02.119
or Jenny, so...

27:08.928 --> 27:11.395
- It's, it's all right son.

27:11.397 --> 27:14.865
All we can do is just love
each other while we're here.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.233
That's just all we can do.

27:17.703 --> 27:18.402
- (sobs) Yeah.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.207
Hey, Aunt Sallie, close
your eyes for me, will you?

27:23.209 --> 27:24.375
- Oh, sure thing, babe.

27:24.377 --> 27:25.843
- Sorry you had to see that.

27:28.648 --> 27:29.413
You know, JA,

27:32.752 --> 27:36.320
I heard when somebody dies,
they only die if you let them,

27:38.090 --> 27:40.090
and that you can keep
them alive inside of you,

27:40.092 --> 27:42.826
and that you can
ask them questions.

27:42.828 --> 27:46.430
I know this might
sound little weird,

27:46.432 --> 27:49.266
but I've been asking Papo
a lot of questions lately,

27:50.803 --> 27:54.271
about like relationships
and like love and stuff

27:54.273 --> 27:56.273
and I think I know
what his answers are.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.343
- I don't think that's
weird at all, babe.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.813
I think you keep
right on doing that.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.848
I bet your Papo's tickled pink.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.150
- I'll bet he is.

28:07.820 --> 28:11.121
Love just tears
you up, doesn't it?

28:11.123 --> 28:14.692
Especially the love
you can't have.

28:14.694 --> 28:15.926
I love you, JA.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.294
- I love you, son.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.130
- And I love you, Aunt Sallie.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.366
- Oh, I love you, big boy.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.334
- And if you see Dad,
just tell him I love him.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.272
(speaking in a foreign language)

28:28.274 --> 28:31.375
And Jenny, you know,
she's such a handful, but,

28:31.377 --> 28:32.309
tell her I love her.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.015
- Honey, that is one sweet
boy you've got there.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.851
Just so full of love.

28:40.853 --> 28:44.855
- Sallie Mae, I'm exhausted.
- I know.

28:44.857 --> 28:47.991
- I'm going to bed and then
I'm getting up in the morning

28:47.993 --> 28:50.294
and I'm going to church.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.995
- Okay.

28:51.997 --> 28:55.966
- I feel like I have been
ridden hard and put up wet.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.034
- All right.

28:58.738 --> 28:59.436
- Lord.

29:01.974 --> 29:05.175
(acoustic guitar music)

29:07.980 --> 29:10.114
- She's a handful, oh Lord.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.450
Ugh.

29:13.452 --> 29:16.487
(lively guitar music)

29:51.924 --> 29:55.125
- What was all that
with Jenny's trash?

29:55.127 --> 29:57.027
- Well, if you stop
attacking me every time

29:57.029 --> 29:59.530
I bend over in Jenny's bedroom.

29:59.532 --> 30:02.232
- Oh, is that how
it happens, huh?

30:04.069 --> 30:07.337
We're not moving in
together until you tell her.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.039
- She's still all stressed out.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.908
It's just, it's
not the right time.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.911
- It's never gonna be
the right time, honey.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.012
And I love you, Juan.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.916
And I know she
suspects something

30:18.918 --> 30:20.918
ever since I talked
you into joining me

30:20.920 --> 30:23.220
on the garden club board.

30:23.222 --> 30:25.389
Somewhere in that brain of hers,

30:25.391 --> 30:28.192
she knows you've been
trimming my bush. (squeals)

30:28.194 --> 30:29.560
- Sallie.

30:29.562 --> 30:31.261
- Talk to me in
Spanish, mi amor.

30:32.565 --> 30:35.299
You know I love you
talking to me in Spanish.

30:38.037 --> 30:42.172
(speaking in a foreign language)

30:42.174 --> 30:44.975
(Sallie moaning)

30:58.090 --> 30:58.889
- Oh Juan!

30:59.992 --> 31:03.227
(lively guitar music)

31:20.479 --> 31:23.480
- Oh, how hard can it be?

31:26.318 --> 31:30.354
Juan, can you come
on inside, please?

31:37.997 --> 31:39.663
- Morning, JA, what
can I do for you?

31:39.665 --> 31:42.599
- You'd help me do just about
anything, wouldn't you, Juan?

31:42.601 --> 31:44.301
- Well, yes, senora.

31:44.303 --> 31:48.939
- I mean, if I asked you
to help me to do something,

31:49.642 --> 31:53.477
say, risky, uh, risque,

31:56.048 --> 31:58.482
you wouldn't judge
me, would you, Juan?

31:58.484 --> 31:59.917
- I would never judge you.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.518
- What's the best
way to kill a man?

32:01.520 --> 32:03.220
- I might judge that.

32:03.222 --> 32:07.524
- No, I mean the best way to
kill a man and not get caught.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.060
I wouldn't wanna do that
jail thing, you know,

32:10.062 --> 32:11.328
- No doubt about that.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.997
I don't think they serve
lattes and croissants

32:13.999 --> 32:15.499
in the clink, JA.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.668
- Well, I've been looking
on the internet and I just,

32:17.670 --> 32:19.703
I can't find what
I'm looking for.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.124
- Who do you wanna kill?

32:24.125 --> 32:25.541
- Let's just say
it's hypothetical.

32:27.179 --> 32:28.712
- Well, I think it does matter.

32:28.714 --> 32:31.114
I've seen you shoot
a deer at 400 yards.

32:31.116 --> 32:32.382
I know you're capable.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.552
- Look, I went to church
and I prayed about it.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.988
- Good.
- And then I thought.

32:39.224 --> 32:42.192
- I'm going Old Testament.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.428
I am so tired of
crying all the time

32:44.430 --> 32:46.663
and feeling sorry for myself.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.498
I'm getting out of my self pity

32:48.500 --> 32:50.434
and into pitying
the son of a bitch

32:50.436 --> 32:52.135
who makes me look like a fool.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.238
- Who are you talking about?

32:55.240 --> 32:57.975
- It's that son
of a bitch Jimmy.

32:57.977 --> 32:59.476
- El senor?

32:59.478 --> 33:01.178
- Yes, he's been cheating
on me down at the coast

33:01.180 --> 33:04.314
and making me look like a fool.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.650
Oh yeah, then he just
comes back in here

33:06.652 --> 33:11.121
like he's had a fresh egg,
just strutting like a peacock.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.322
Well, I've had it.

33:13.292 --> 33:16.526
I was gonna take a knife to him.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.128
But then I thought,
no, that's too bloody.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.430
I don't have the
stomach for that.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.734
So then I thought,
oh, the deer rifle.

33:23.736 --> 33:25.302
But they'd just
trace the bullet.

33:26.638 --> 33:29.306
Juan, we need to come
up with a good poison,

33:29.308 --> 33:31.641
like that doctor from
Houston who poisoned

33:31.643 --> 33:32.676
his wife's eclairs.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.144
I think he got away with it.

33:34.146 --> 33:36.580
No investigation,
I can't do a trial.

33:36.582 --> 33:37.547
Will you help me, Juan?

33:39.351 --> 33:42.452
- JA, you don't mean that.

33:42.454 --> 33:45.355
Jimmy loves you very much.

33:46.592 --> 33:49.159
- The hell that I don't.

33:49.161 --> 33:51.461
- I'm on your side, please JA.

33:51.463 --> 33:55.465
This is all a big
misunderstanding.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.768
Have you looked in the freezer?

33:57.770 --> 34:00.537
He caught those fish
the old-fashioned way,

34:00.539 --> 34:01.605
with a rod and reel.

34:03.342 --> 34:06.376
- Juan, he probably bought them
off of Porter Rand's Seafood

34:06.378 --> 34:08.078
along with the sushi.

34:08.080 --> 34:12.149
He is a grade A later and
he will meet his wrath.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.052
- You'd be about the
only person I know

34:15.054 --> 34:16.686
who'd go to church and come back

34:16.688 --> 34:19.089
with wrath and
murder on your mind.

34:19.091 --> 34:21.058
You're lucky Juan and
I care enough about you

34:21.060 --> 34:23.693
to keep you from doing
something stupid, stupid.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.829
- You better watch
your mouth, mouth.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.264
- What you gonna do honey,

34:27.266 --> 34:29.599
you gonna murder
him in cold blood?

34:29.601 --> 34:32.669
Maybe cut him up and
throw him to the fish?

34:32.671 --> 34:35.405
- Now that's an idea.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.541
You're not as useless
as I thought you were.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.812
- Listen here, Rambo, there
ain't a man on this planet

34:41.814 --> 34:44.581
worth the aggravation of murder.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.516
You know what you need?

34:46.518 --> 34:48.385
You need a good old
fashioned sun-in.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.686
- Good point.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.088
- Remember what Papo
used to always say?

34:51.090 --> 34:53.090
If you lay it out in the sun--

34:53.092 --> 34:54.858
- [Both] Don't smell so bad.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.461
- Kills the mildew, dries it up.

34:57.463 --> 35:00.597
You need to just lay it all out
for the whole family to see.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.165
You know what else you need?

35:02.167 --> 35:03.433
A bloody Mary.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.635
Hell, we all do, it's Sunday.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.271
Juan, would you be a
doll and make us one

35:08.273 --> 35:10.173
and make them strong?

35:10.175 --> 35:11.208
- Yes, ma'am.

35:16.148 --> 35:19.282
- I went to church and I
prayed for the strength

35:19.284 --> 35:21.485
to forgive him.

35:21.487 --> 35:26.356
And then I prayed for the
strength to smite him dead.

35:28.127 --> 35:31.761
I have killed, field
dressed, and taken apart

35:31.763 --> 35:32.762
more damn animals.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.365
Parts is parts.

35:35.367 --> 35:40.237
- Jeanne Anne, when is the
last time you gave Jimmy a hug?

35:42.641 --> 35:45.509
Just a good and
simple goddamn hug?

35:48.580 --> 35:50.881
- Maybe I haven't
been the best wife.

35:55.154 --> 35:59.222
Maybe I shoulda gone
huntin' and fishin'

35:59.224 --> 36:03.293
and to some of those ball games.

36:03.295 --> 36:08.165
- You can fix all of this,
just hug the bastard.

36:09.334 --> 36:13.803
Tell him you love
him, to his face.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.705
Ask him how his day was.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.676
Don't bitch at him first
thing in the morning.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.344
- Nobody likes to
be nagged, Mom.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.245
It's uncouth.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.247
- Uncouth?

36:29.421 --> 36:31.688
What am I going to do?

36:31.690 --> 36:36.193
- Well, first of all,
you're not gonna kill Jimmy.

36:36.195 --> 36:38.295
- No, no, no, no.

36:39.765 --> 36:43.400
I mean, what am I
gonna cook for dinner?

36:43.402 --> 36:46.469
- I don't know, just cook
that damn fish Jimmy caught.

36:46.471 --> 36:48.572
- I'm not cooking
adultress fish.

36:50.475 --> 36:53.476
- All right, fine, then
enchiladas, I'll help.

36:53.478 --> 36:56.246
- That's it, I'm
cooking enchiladas.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.348
- Besides, I need to
keep an eye on you.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.620
- Boy is that ranch dry.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.956
I ain't never seen it like
this, like the damn '50s.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.624
The cows are all starvin'.

37:07.626 --> 37:09.759
I'm gonna lose all my
damn breeding stock.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.562
Cows are eating cactus,
stones and all, poor bastards.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.730
Can you imagine
what that feels like

37:13.732 --> 37:14.798
comin' out the other end?

37:15.867 --> 37:17.567
Prickly situation.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.768
- Why are you covered in blood?

37:18.770 --> 37:21.504
And what the hell is
that around your neck?

37:21.506 --> 37:23.373
- Well, it's pig
blood, Sallie Mae.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.774
That there, that's
some guts on my boot.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.409
I shot a pig.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.245
Yeah, I was out with
the boys there huntin'

37:28.247 --> 37:31.348
and they wanted a porker for
the luau at the frat house.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.550
So I killed one and I
cleaned it for them.

37:33.552 --> 37:36.286
And then all them damn fleas
jumped off that damn pig

37:36.288 --> 37:39.422
onto me, so I got me
a Hartz flea collar,

37:39.424 --> 37:41.358
try to get them off me.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.593
- Don't you bring any
damn fleas into my house.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.828
- They're already off me.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.296
The last one came
off about 4:10.

37:46.298 --> 37:50.834
Little fuckers are scrambling
all over the Suburban now.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.969
Hell, I shot right
through the ear hole.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.939
You know how hard it is to
take down a pig with one shot?

37:55.941 --> 37:58.375
- I can imagine, that
sounds like quite a feat.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.643
You should be very proud.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.411
- Oh yes.
- Hey Pops, how's the ranch?

38:01.413 --> 38:03.580
- Oh, it's drier
than a popcorn fart.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.482
Makes me thirsty just
thinking about it.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.384
- Gross, where's Anthony?

38:07.386 --> 38:08.985
Is he with Tiger?

38:08.987 --> 38:10.387
- I don't know.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.855
Juan, boy, you
read my mind, man.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.323
How do you do that?

38:13.325 --> 38:14.891
You scare the shit
out of me sometimes.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.960
- (laughs) Salud.
- Salud.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.496
- Salud.
(screams)

38:19.498 --> 38:23.967
- Get away from me you freak!
(snake rattling)

38:23.969 --> 38:26.002
- You all see the
rattler on that?

38:26.004 --> 38:29.005
- What the hell are you doing

38:29.007 --> 38:30.507
bringing a live
rattlesnake into the house?

38:30.509 --> 38:31.975
Would you go get
them under control

38:31.977 --> 38:34.344
before someone gets bit?

38:34.346 --> 38:35.812
What kind of ranch
manager does that?

38:35.814 --> 38:38.848
Papo would be ashamed.

38:47.559 --> 38:48.925
- You know Jeanne Anne,
you don't always have to be

38:48.927 --> 38:50.960
such a glorified bitch.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.363
They were just having some fun.

38:53.365 --> 38:56.333
- What did he just call me?

38:56.335 --> 38:57.033
- Bitch.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.103
- What an asshole!

39:00.105 --> 39:04.841
Oh my God, that man
makes me so mad.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.876
I am gonna show him!

39:06.878 --> 39:07.777
- JA, hey!

39:09.047 --> 39:10.280
- Jeanne Anne,
what are you doing?

39:10.281 --> 39:11.514
You don't think she'd
actually do something

39:11.515 --> 39:12.748
with that gun, do you?

39:12.751 --> 39:14.718
I mean, (gunshots firing).

39:14.720 --> 39:16.419
Oh my God!

39:16.421 --> 39:18.121
- She shot him!
(gunshots firing)

39:18.123 --> 39:20.357
- Oh my God, JA!

39:20.359 --> 39:23.460
- Geez, I didn't think you
were gonna take it so hard.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.894
- What are you talking about?

39:24.896 --> 39:26.596
Your mama killed his daddy

39:26.598 --> 39:28.631
and you don't think
he's gonna take it hard?

39:28.633 --> 39:30.433
What is wrong with you, child?

39:30.435 --> 39:32.602
- What are you talking
about, Aunt Sallie?

39:32.604 --> 39:34.471
- Sallie Mae, you're getting
crazier by the minute.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.872
- No, no, no, no, she shot him.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.407
- Jimmy raised him like his own.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.042
Why would you shoot him?

39:39.044 --> 39:41.611
- Jimmy! You're not dead!

39:41.613 --> 39:43.480
- No, I didn't kill him.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.949
I killed that little
slithery bastard.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.784
- Damn sure did,
deader than a doornail.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.085
Pretty good shooting, too.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.887
- Killed my snake, man.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.589
- Damn right I did.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.759
Papo always said the only good
rattlesnake is a dead one.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.894
- Yeah, well, I was
gonna take that snake

39:57.896 --> 40:01.064
down to the frat house and
get even with Jethro Tull,

40:01.066 --> 40:02.732
'cause he stuck a
scorpion in my bed

40:02.734 --> 40:06.002
and the damn thing stung
on my on my left sac.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.837
It swelled up to the
size of a cantaloupe

40:07.839 --> 40:09.506
and looked black.

40:09.508 --> 40:10.807
And LuAnn Reed wouldn't
have anything to do with me

40:10.809 --> 40:13.810
and I was this close,
and you ruined it, Jenny.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.645
So I'm not talking
to you anymore.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.881
- Good, I hope you don't if
you're gonna chase me around

40:17.883 --> 40:19.783
laughing like a dumb
fucking redneck.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.887
- Jenny, not, and the
whole thing was a,

40:23.889 --> 40:25.588
never mind.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.158
Goddammit Dad, I can't
believe how cruel she is.

40:30.896 --> 40:33.096
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.832
- These damn kids are crazier
than a den of wildcats.

40:35.834 --> 40:39.636
I'm surrounded by screwballs,
all led by the queen bee.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.672
- What the hell was that?

40:43.809 --> 40:45.508
My head's about spun off!

40:47.012 --> 40:49.479
Hell, so much for a
relaxing Sunday meal, damn!

40:51.750 --> 40:53.016
- I have work to do.

40:54.186 --> 40:55.185
- Good Lord.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.823
Looks like the wedding's
off between those two.

40:59.825 --> 41:03.860
Damn, it's hard to keep up with
all the trauma in your life.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.795
You know you had me going there?

41:05.797 --> 41:08.131
I thought you
really took him out.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.799
- I don't have the heart,

41:09.801 --> 41:11.968
for prison that is.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.703
- Yeah, well, who would?

41:13.705 --> 41:15.472
Definitely not
your kind of place.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.808
You never did look
good in orange,

41:18.810 --> 41:22.245
stripes, prints,
any kind of pastels.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.181
Oh hell, let's get
some air, come on.

41:26.218 --> 41:28.551
You know baby, I've been
thinking about this.

41:28.553 --> 41:31.855
Maybe it is time you two
went your separate ways.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.591
I mean, you always did
have problems with men.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.161
Maybe it's time you started
batting for the other time.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.630
I mean, this isn't
the '50s darling.

41:40.632 --> 41:41.531
Everybody's doing it.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.735
- I don't care who's doing
what, I could care less.

41:45.737 --> 41:49.873
Oh hell, speaking of
everybody doing it.

41:49.875 --> 41:51.174
Sallie Mae...

42:00.051 --> 42:01.184
Oh!
- Come on.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.888
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

42:04.890 --> 42:07.724
- Oh hell, I've got it.

42:07.726 --> 42:09.993
We can take out an ad in
the Austin Chronicles.

42:10.996 --> 42:14.731
Ragin' beauty in her 50s.

42:14.733 --> 42:16.566
- Early 50s.

42:16.568 --> 42:18.167
- Early 50s, okay.

42:18.169 --> 42:21.871
Enjoys bein' in
church, books, art,

42:21.873 --> 42:23.940
Fleetwood Mac.
- KD Lang.

42:23.942 --> 42:25.141
- Oh, and KD Lang.

42:26.545 --> 42:29.812
Travel, cookin', kids grown.

42:29.814 --> 42:34.751
Seeking pleasant,
pretty lipstick lesbian.

42:34.753 --> 42:37.620
Must be independent but caring.

42:38.590 --> 42:41.057
- Oh, no beer gut. (laughs)

42:41.059 --> 42:41.991
- And no beer gut.

42:43.762 --> 42:47.964
Somebody who's gonna
listen to your needs.

42:47.966 --> 42:50.667
Somebody to make you
feel appreciated.

42:52.270 --> 42:54.637
Somebody in tune with maybe
your emotional rhythms.

42:56.041 --> 42:58.074
- Girl, are you hitting on me?

42:58.076 --> 42:59.642
- Well, I'm just
trying to help honey.

42:59.644 --> 43:01.177
- You have no boundaries.

43:01.179 --> 43:03.613
- Well, that doesn't
make me a bad person.

43:03.615 --> 43:05.348
- First of all, I'm happy

43:05.350 --> 43:08.318
with my present sexual
orientation, thank you.

43:09.821 --> 43:13.790
Secondly, if I was gonna
dabble on the other side

43:13.792 --> 43:15.225
of the road, girl--
- What?

43:15.226 --> 43:16.659
- It's not gonna be with you.

43:16.661 --> 43:18.861
And thirdly, I've got
my gazpacho to make

43:18.863 --> 43:20.797
and it's not gonna make itself.

43:20.799 --> 43:22.899
- I know, listen to me, here.

43:22.901 --> 43:27.770
Abstinence is not a
sexual orientation.

43:29.374 --> 43:33.176
Secondly, I just trying to
help you get through this

43:33.178 --> 43:37.614
without killing yourself
or anybody else.

43:37.616 --> 43:40.083
Thirdly, well honey, mmm.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.052
You got options.

43:44.022 --> 43:47.323
And hey, there is always porn.

43:47.325 --> 43:49.359
- Oh my God, you are sick.

43:50.862 --> 43:52.996
- Hey, let's have
one, real quick.

43:52.998 --> 43:54.964
Just give it a little
tongue, come on.

43:54.966 --> 44:00.003
- Oh, Jimmy!
(yells)

44:01.373 --> 44:04.340
- Well shit, don't mind me
ladies, I hate to interrupt.

44:04.342 --> 44:06.042
That is unless you two
want my steak salami

44:06.044 --> 44:07.343
between those buttery loaves.

44:07.345 --> 44:12.215
- Oh my God, you are a sicko.

44:12.217 --> 44:15.118
- Hell, maybe I am, but at
least I know how to have fun.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.387
Sick and tired of y'all's
crazy bullshit anyways.

44:17.389 --> 44:20.356
I'm going to the skeet
range for donating blood.

44:20.358 --> 44:22.892
Whatever the hell to
get away from you guys.

44:22.894 --> 44:26.729
- Don't mind him, Bigtime Jimmy.

44:26.731 --> 44:28.264
Let's go make them enchiladas.

44:28.266 --> 44:31.167
- Oh, you put too many
damn onions on them for me.

44:31.169 --> 44:33.736
- All right, you gonna
get changed though,

44:33.738 --> 44:34.937
closing up the work straps.

44:36.341 --> 44:39.375
(lively guitar music)

44:53.091 --> 44:55.825
- How are you doing Anthony?
- Good.

45:17.949 --> 45:21.150
- No thanks, gotta keep my wits.

45:23.722 --> 45:26.022
There's just too much
shit goin' on around here.

45:29.194 --> 45:30.927
I thought Jimmy was (speaking
in a foreign language).

45:33.031 --> 45:34.997
- Things sure are tense
around here, huh, Juan?

45:34.999 --> 45:36.265
Even you look worried.

45:37.802 --> 45:39.202
Well, first thing's first, man.

45:40.772 --> 45:44.974
You, you gotta figure out
what you want, how to get it

45:44.976 --> 45:46.509
without Jack and
anybody else around.

45:48.146 --> 45:49.312
- That's the problem.

45:50.815 --> 45:53.216
Well, if you come from a
place of love, Juan, I mean,

45:55.453 --> 45:58.054
the world will just have
to deal with it, man.

45:59.057 --> 46:01.023
- I come from a place of love,

46:01.025 --> 46:02.859
(speaking in a
foreign language).

46:05.497 --> 46:06.296
What did you call me?

46:06.297 --> 46:07.096
- A celebration of life, man,

46:08.533 --> 46:13.069
we're made out of
stardust, dude, like first,

46:13.071 --> 46:16.439
second, third
generation of stars,

46:17.976 --> 46:21.410
supernova explosions,
stellar nebulae, man.

46:22.781 --> 46:24.413
And we're on this glob of dust,

46:24.415 --> 46:27.183
shooting around our star
like a bowling ball, man,

46:28.887 --> 46:31.521
at 66,000 miles per hour.

46:34.058 --> 46:35.424
- That's some serious speed.

46:35.426 --> 46:38.027
- Yes sir, it is.

46:38.029 --> 46:40.363
And at the same time,
we are just shooting

46:40.365 --> 46:43.232
through the galaxy at half
a million miles an hour,

46:43.234 --> 46:44.534
through the cosmic
background radiation

46:44.536 --> 46:46.969
at 1.3 million miles an hour.

46:46.971 --> 46:48.971
And the entire time,
man, I swear to you,

46:50.542 --> 46:52.441
sometimes I feel like
I'm just sitting still.

46:54.379 --> 46:55.945
- Sometimes I feel
like my life's going

46:55.947 --> 46:57.246
a million miles an hour.

46:59.818 --> 47:00.883
- You know what?

47:03.021 --> 47:05.488
This'll slow it down, man.

47:05.490 --> 47:08.124
Come on, Juan, come on Juan.

47:08.126 --> 47:09.526
You know you want
the joint, Juan,

47:09.527 --> 47:10.927
you know you want
the joint, Juan,

47:10.929 --> 47:13.396
you know, oh, yeah baby.

47:13.398 --> 47:14.997
- You're bad dude.

47:14.999 --> 47:15.998
You got some fire?

47:17.101 --> 47:21.204
(speaking in a foreign language)

47:26.010 --> 47:28.177
- Geez, dude, is
this Papo's weed?

47:28.179 --> 47:29.212
- Yes sir, (speaking
in a foreign language).

47:32.283 --> 47:33.516
You know what else
my philosophy teacher

47:33.518 --> 47:35.518
was telling me about, man?

47:35.520 --> 47:39.155
So like, we live
at the phase change

47:39.157 --> 47:41.224
between water,
steam, and ice, dude.

47:41.226 --> 47:43.125
Fucking water, Juan.

47:43.127 --> 47:46.429
It's a fucking miracle, man,
it's a fucking miracle, dude.

47:46.431 --> 47:47.597
We're like fucking water.

47:49.067 --> 47:50.132
You with me, man?

47:51.302 --> 47:52.602
- Oh yeah.

47:52.604 --> 47:56.472
(speaking in a foreign language)

47:56.474 --> 47:58.507
1.3 million miles an hour,

47:58.509 --> 48:01.444
living at the
water phase change.

48:01.446 --> 48:05.581
- Dude, and I'm saying we live
on this outer layer of dust.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.383
We're not trapped in the rock.

48:07.385 --> 48:09.385
We're not trapped in the mantle.

48:09.387 --> 48:10.987
We can move through time.

48:10.989 --> 48:12.521
We're not stuck like that tree.

48:12.523 --> 48:15.291
We're not floating around
like a leaf in water, man.

48:16.561 --> 48:20.429
We breathe in the stardust,
we breathe it out.

48:20.431 --> 48:23.933
We drink it in,
Juan, we pee it out.

48:23.935 --> 48:26.035
I mean, we eat it
in and we just--

48:26.037 --> 48:28.537
- I get it man, I get it dude.

48:28.539 --> 48:31.207
Do you believe we were born
on a predetermined path?

48:31.209 --> 48:33.442
I was watching Charlie
Rose the other night,

48:33.444 --> 48:37.246
and they had this dude on there
that was talking about like

48:37.248 --> 48:39.181
how we have these
places on our DNA

48:39.183 --> 48:42.018
that are like predisposed.

48:42.020 --> 48:45.154
And they can like turn on
and off, changing as we live.

48:45.156 --> 48:47.523
And then like this
thing switches on

48:47.525 --> 48:51.294
and then this molecule like
links us with our past.

48:52.697 --> 48:55.231
Yeah, isn't that
fucking crazy, man?

48:57.402 --> 48:58.301
- That's the stardust, bro.

48:59.704 --> 49:01.971
That's the stardust, man.

49:01.973 --> 49:04.407
That's the stardust, Juan!

49:04.409 --> 49:07.043
It has been traveling back
and forth between time

49:07.045 --> 49:09.445
and energy, dude.

49:09.447 --> 49:12.281
And it ends up right
here, right now dude,

49:12.283 --> 49:13.616
it's in me, it's in you.

49:15.086 --> 49:17.553
Look at it, brother,
the stars, man.

49:17.555 --> 49:18.988
That's what we're made of.

49:23.428 --> 49:26.195
Yeah, man, that's what
I'm talking about.

49:27.966 --> 49:31.334
- Did you know that if you
live 14 years on this earth,

49:31.336 --> 49:34.136
you're breathing the
same air molecules as

49:34.138 --> 49:36.272
Julius Cesar, Abraham Lincoln.

49:39.444 --> 49:40.343
Dwight Howard.

49:41.446 --> 49:43.012
(laughs)

49:43.014 --> 49:44.113
- That was a funny one.

49:44.115 --> 49:46.482
- Hell, even Charlie Rose, man.

49:49.387 --> 49:50.319
- Papo is in us.

49:52.724 --> 49:54.557
He's in me.

49:54.559 --> 49:56.492
- What, man?

49:56.494 --> 49:57.526
Papo's in you?

49:59.564 --> 50:00.463
Hey Papo.

50:02.433 --> 50:07.003
- No, man, it's like I can
hear him talking to me.

50:07.005 --> 50:09.772
Not like a voice,
more like a sensation.

50:11.509 --> 50:15.745
It's like I can ask
him a question and I--

50:15.747 --> 50:18.748
[Both] Know what the
answer would be, yes.

50:18.750 --> 50:21.317
- Yeah, yeah man.

50:22.653 --> 50:24.020
- The stardust speaks, man.

50:25.023 --> 50:26.355
- Sure does.

50:29.660 --> 50:31.227
- Give me some sugar, big boy.

50:39.137 --> 50:40.436
I love you, man.

50:40.438 --> 50:45.307
- I love you, too, mi amigo.

50:46.310 --> 50:47.143
- Are you coming to dinner?

50:47.145 --> 50:50.346
- Yes my friend, I am,
I'm coming to dinner.

50:50.348 --> 50:53.482
- I am so hungry man, I
am so hungry right now!

50:53.484 --> 50:56.285
- (laughs) I can't imagine why.

51:04.695 --> 51:05.594
- Stardust, baby.

51:09.167 --> 51:11.367
(chuckling)

51:15.339 --> 51:17.506
- Juan, are you busy?

51:21.412 --> 51:23.712
- Just contemplating the stars.

51:30.354 --> 51:31.253
- Am I a bitch?

51:36.127 --> 51:38.394
- Stop being so
hard on yourself.

51:40.231 --> 51:41.797
You're not making it any easier.

51:44.268 --> 51:45.434
- I try.

51:46.838 --> 51:51.474
Then I just go back
to my ways of being

51:51.476 --> 51:56.245
too damn serious and mean.

51:58.549 --> 52:03.319
I wish I was more like
Sallie, just fun-loving, free.

52:05.456 --> 52:07.289
I've always admired her.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.128
- Hey Mom.

52:12.130 --> 52:14.797
- Oh hey, honey, I hope
you had a great workout.

52:17.802 --> 52:21.303
- Why do you have to be so
sarcastic all the damn time?

52:21.305 --> 52:22.805
You don't appreciate
a damn thing I do

52:22.807 --> 52:24.306
for this family, Jeanne Anne.

52:25.910 --> 52:30.179
Dammit woman, why do you
always have to be so negative?

52:31.415 --> 52:32.848
You treat me like I'm a dumbass.

52:34.152 --> 52:36.285
You don't respect me.

52:39.557 --> 52:40.322
You never have.

52:43.427 --> 52:48.164
- Juan, we're gonna finish
this conversation later.

53:04.916 --> 53:07.516
- I'm sorry Juan, man I'm sorry.

53:07.518 --> 53:12.454
Her nagging, it doesn't roll
off me like it used to, man.

53:12.456 --> 53:16.258
You know, I don't even
know why she's mad at me.

53:16.260 --> 53:18.694
I mean, I know that I'm not
the lean mean fighting machine

53:18.696 --> 53:20.229
I always was.

53:21.465 --> 53:22.565
But I still got feelings.

53:23.734 --> 53:25.534
Hell, I'm more
sensitive now than ever.

53:32.210 --> 53:33.375
That's just not love.

53:34.679 --> 53:36.879
- If you come from
a place of love,

53:36.881 --> 53:38.847
the world will just
have to deal with it.

53:40.651 --> 53:42.551
- That's not where
I'm coming from, Juan.

53:44.488 --> 53:47.890
In fact, I'm going
by not coming.

53:49.694 --> 53:52.294
I'm gonna get drunk.

53:52.296 --> 53:54.663
I'm gonna eat some redfish.

53:54.665 --> 53:56.232
I'm gonna watch Lonesome Doves.

53:57.835 --> 54:00.236
- Jimmy, please come to dinner.

54:02.440 --> 54:04.273
I have something important
to tell everyone.

54:06.410 --> 54:08.911
- Dinner, there's no way Juan.

54:10.548 --> 54:12.481
Man, I heard her talking
about killing me.

54:13.784 --> 54:15.317
She said it, she
was serious, man.

54:15.319 --> 54:16.719
I ain't never seen
her like this.

54:16.721 --> 54:18.254
She's lost her damn mind.

54:18.256 --> 54:19.521
- She's not serious.

54:21.425 --> 54:25.294
Come on, man, please
come to dinner, for me.

54:25.296 --> 54:26.295
Come on, man.

54:27.965 --> 54:28.864
- For you.

54:31.602 --> 54:32.334
- Thanks, Jimmy.

54:34.538 --> 54:35.437
- For you.

54:55.026 --> 54:58.527
(gentle acoustic guitar)

55:03.834 --> 55:06.969
¶ Leroy's son's got
a brand new gun ¶

55:06.971 --> 55:12.041
¶ And he's goin' 95 up to Dena

55:13.077 --> 55:15.944
¶ Got a plan he's
gonna kill this man ¶

55:15.946 --> 55:17.613
- I like jalapenos, except
for when they get hot.

55:17.615 --> 55:19.481
- I hate jalapenos.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.950
- Jenny, jalapenos are
cleansing, they're good for you.

55:21.952 --> 55:24.820
- Got the salsa, y'all.

55:24.822 --> 55:25.688
- Why are you wearing
your sunglasses?

55:25.690 --> 55:26.555
- Shut up.

55:28.993 --> 55:30.826
- Salsa.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.995
- Would you take your glasses
off, for the last time?

55:32.997 --> 55:35.497
- Jesus Christ,
let's eat already.

55:35.499 --> 55:38.067
God bless this food
and treat us good.

55:46.844 --> 55:49.912
- Bless this food we're
about to be nourished with,

55:49.914 --> 55:51.347
and especially Lord Jesus,

55:52.817 --> 55:55.050
the two beautiful women
who prepared it for us.

55:56.854 --> 55:59.588
Please give us the strength
to tell the truth, oh Lord,

55:59.590 --> 56:00.589
maker of the stardust,

56:01.859 --> 56:03.759
and lead us all to forgiveness.

56:03.761 --> 56:06.528
- Come on, now, when did
you get so preachy, Juan?

56:06.530 --> 56:08.063
- That was very pretty.

56:08.065 --> 56:11.400
- If you need something
done in a physical plane,

56:11.402 --> 56:14.036
please, do it through us.

56:14.038 --> 56:16.405
We are your ideas
going through time

56:16.407 --> 56:18.607
on this bowling ball of--

56:18.609 --> 56:20.042
- Right on, Juan.

56:20.044 --> 56:21.910
- Are you fucking kidding me?

56:21.912 --> 56:22.945
Bowling ball?

56:22.947 --> 56:25.414
- Shut your derelict mouth.

56:25.416 --> 56:26.148
I love him.

56:28.085 --> 56:31.420
- Juan, I thought that
was a lovely prayer.

56:31.422 --> 56:33.455
I especially liked
the part about

56:33.457 --> 56:37.459
giving us the strength
to tell the truth.

56:39.063 --> 56:40.963
Where shall we start?

56:40.965 --> 56:42.898
Jenny, Anthony, is
there something you
two little lovebirds

56:42.900 --> 56:45.134
just wanna get off your chest?

56:45.136 --> 56:48.070
- She's certifiable,
totally lost it.

56:48.072 --> 56:50.906
- Why don't you just admit
in front of everyone,

56:50.908 --> 56:52.574
that you're pregnant,

56:52.576 --> 56:55.144
and even more so that your
brother is the father?

56:55.146 --> 56:57.413
I know, there are
no secrets here.

56:57.415 --> 56:58.814
- Wait a minute here.

56:58.816 --> 57:01.717
Okay, you're saying
that I had a kid,

57:01.719 --> 57:06.588
a tiny little baby, like a
little human being with her?

57:07.825 --> 57:09.091
- Eyew.
- My sister?

57:09.093 --> 57:10.959
- You can't fuck your sister.

57:10.961 --> 57:13.562
- Dad, no way, man, no way.

57:13.564 --> 57:16.765
I mean, I'm hard up
and that would be like

57:16.767 --> 57:18.934
an all-time low.

57:18.936 --> 57:20.969
From Old Mexico,

57:23.474 --> 57:25.607
little boy city.

57:25.609 --> 57:28.010
- Wait, you been crabbing
down at Boystown?

57:29.079 --> 57:31.680
Well, don't break out
the seafood, Mama,

57:31.682 --> 57:33.449
Anthony's coming
home with crabs.

57:33.451 --> 57:35.217
- Oh.

57:36.153 --> 57:37.820
- You're fucking disturbing.

57:37.822 --> 57:39.621
And mother, you're nuttier
than a squirrel turd.

57:39.623 --> 57:41.023
You need help.

57:41.025 --> 57:43.826
- I didn't raise you
kids to be fornicating

57:43.828 --> 57:46.829
like a pack of
backwood hillbillies.

57:46.831 --> 57:48.864
What would your Papo have said?

57:48.866 --> 57:51.667
He's probably turning
over in his grave.

57:51.669 --> 57:53.669
- Papo would duct
tape your mouth

57:53.671 --> 57:56.505
and hands and feet, and take
you to the mental hospital

57:56.507 --> 57:57.973
because you have lost it.

57:57.975 --> 57:59.942
I've gotta get this psycho
bitch on my Snapchat.

57:59.944 --> 58:02.177
- Don't you lie
to me, young lady.

58:02.179 --> 58:04.847
There are no secrets
in the Kappa house.

58:04.849 --> 58:06.682
You admitted it to your roommate

58:06.684 --> 58:08.917
and we found your
pregnancy test.

58:09.854 --> 58:11.019
- That's reassuring.

58:11.021 --> 58:13.055
So you bugged my room at school

58:13.057 --> 58:15.023
and you go through my trash?

58:15.025 --> 58:17.993
Jeanne Anne Williker, NSA Mom.

58:17.995 --> 58:19.895
- Wait, did you bug her room?

58:19.897 --> 58:22.097
Do we have to break out
the straitjacket tonight?

58:22.099 --> 58:26.735
- No, her suitemate
overheard her say

58:26.737 --> 58:29.271
that she was in
love with Anthony.

58:29.273 --> 58:32.574
- Jeanne Anne, please,
Anthony is not the only

58:32.576 --> 58:35.110
goddamn Anthony at the
University of Texas.

58:35.112 --> 58:36.678
Did you ever think about that?

58:39.550 --> 58:44.219
- Well, I, she said it
was forbidden fruit.

58:44.221 --> 58:47.723
- Mother, is that what
all this is really about?

58:47.725 --> 58:49.558
Me and Anthony?

58:49.560 --> 58:52.728
Or can you just not deal
with your own issues?

58:52.730 --> 58:53.896
- Anthony and I.

58:55.599 --> 58:58.000
- It's a direct object
pronoun after a verb, JA.

58:58.969 --> 59:00.235
- You really wanna know?

59:01.138 --> 59:02.971
- You have no idea.

59:02.973 --> 59:04.206
- It's true.
- Oh my God.

59:05.309 --> 59:06.275
- All of it.

59:07.645 --> 59:12.114
We are in love and having a baby

59:12.116 --> 59:16.985
on an inbred reality TV show
called Backwoods America.

59:17.955 --> 59:21.623
And your face is gonna be

59:21.625 --> 59:25.127
Granny Backwood, plastered
all across America.

59:26.797 --> 59:30.265
You're gonna be Hillbilly
Dynasty, yee-haw.

59:31.769 --> 59:32.801
- I knew it, I knew it!

59:34.071 --> 59:35.604
You can't lie to me.

59:35.606 --> 59:37.940
I am not crazy, I am no fool.

59:37.942 --> 59:40.809
Ooh, I can't breathe,
I can't breathe.

59:40.811 --> 59:42.277
- You gotta breathe.

59:42.279 --> 59:45.647
- We're just pulling
your leg here, okay.

59:45.649 --> 59:47.616
We're just pulling your leg.

59:47.618 --> 59:50.852
And I have to admit, you
kinda make it easy for us.

59:50.854 --> 59:55.724
But I mean, honey, though,
for real, the twins,

59:57.127 --> 59:58.660
we're having twins.

59:58.662 --> 59:59.928
They're gonna be two-headed.

1:00:00.998 --> 1:00:04.132
- So, are you two
in love or not?

1:00:05.102 --> 1:00:06.802
(laughing)

1:00:06.804 --> 1:00:09.037
- No, JA, you're really
trying to make me hurl here.

1:00:09.039 --> 1:00:13.909
No, but if we are having a come
to Jesus session right now,

1:00:16.313 --> 1:00:19.815
I'm gonna lay it all
right down on the line

1:00:20.851 --> 1:00:22.184
once and for all.

1:00:24.288 --> 1:00:25.220
I am in love

1:00:27.791 --> 1:00:28.323
with Aunt Sallie.

1:00:29.393 --> 1:00:30.292
- What?

1:00:32.162 --> 1:00:34.162
- And she won't have
anything to do with me.

1:00:34.164 --> 1:00:37.032
- Sallie Mae, my goodness,
you pedophile you.

1:00:37.034 --> 1:00:39.001
(Sallie stammering)

1:00:39.003 --> 1:00:42.638
- For once I can honestly
say I didn't do anything.

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:45.273
- Everybody's in love
with Aunt Sallie, son.

1:00:45.275 --> 1:00:46.174
- What?

1:00:47.678 --> 1:00:49.144
- I mean, we all love her.

1:00:49.146 --> 1:00:53.849
She has so much
love in her heart.

1:00:53.851 --> 1:00:56.785
- Oh, yeah, well thank you.

1:00:56.787 --> 1:00:58.153
- I can tell you there's
a lot of love there,

1:00:58.155 --> 1:00:59.354
but it's not in her heart.

1:00:59.356 --> 1:01:02.791
She can hardly keep
it in her pants.

1:01:02.793 --> 1:01:05.360
- Okay, what the hell, how did
this get turned around on me?

1:01:05.362 --> 1:01:06.962
Now let's stay on task here.

1:01:06.964 --> 1:01:11.333
Now Jenny, if your
brother is not the father,

1:01:11.335 --> 1:01:12.701
then who is?

1:01:12.703 --> 1:01:14.403
- What?

1:01:14.405 --> 1:01:16.371
- Well, who got you in the
family way there, sugar?

1:01:16.373 --> 1:01:18.440
- What are you talking about?

1:01:18.442 --> 1:01:20.742
- There was a positive
pregnancy test

1:01:20.744 --> 1:01:22.711
in your trash, damn child.

1:01:22.713 --> 1:01:24.179
Don't you know who
knocked you up?

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:26.782
- It is fine if you don't know.

1:01:26.784 --> 1:01:28.684
- Whoa, you got storked?

1:01:28.686 --> 1:01:30.686
- No Anthony, you're stoned.

1:01:30.688 --> 1:01:32.387
- You don't got any proof.

1:01:32.389 --> 1:01:35.757
- Melissa, from next
door, didn't want her mom

1:01:35.759 --> 1:01:36.925
to find out she's pregnant,

1:01:36.927 --> 1:01:39.061
so she did her test over here.

1:01:39.063 --> 1:01:41.263
You have to swear
you won't tell.

1:01:41.265 --> 1:01:43.432
- I told you it was
that neighbor's girl.

1:01:43.434 --> 1:01:45.934
That Melissa has a different
guy over every week.

1:01:45.936 --> 1:01:47.169
- That little slut.

1:01:49.106 --> 1:01:51.807
- So there's no baby?

1:01:51.809 --> 1:01:54.042
- There is no baby.

1:01:54.044 --> 1:01:56.745
- Oh thank God.

1:01:56.747 --> 1:01:59.147
Oh don't get me wrong,
I do want grandkids,

1:01:59.149 --> 1:02:03.018
just not like this
and not on reality TV.

1:02:05.422 --> 1:02:09.124
But wait a minute, why did
you tell your suitemate

1:02:09.126 --> 1:02:11.259
that you were in
love with Anthony?

1:02:11.261 --> 1:02:13.028
- Just let it go.

1:02:14.398 --> 1:02:15.731
- Oh Jenny.

1:02:17.301 --> 1:02:21.169
Oh, you're good, your Aunt
Sallie taught you how to lie

1:02:21.171 --> 1:02:24.973
amongst other things,
but I know that look.

1:02:24.975 --> 1:02:26.975
No, you're hiding something.

1:02:28.445 --> 1:02:29.444
Whoa.

1:02:32.416 --> 1:02:36.151
You're in love, that's
it, you're in love.

1:02:36.153 --> 1:02:37.519
Oh, she's in love.

1:02:39.423 --> 1:02:42.257
But wait a minute, with who?

1:02:43.761 --> 1:02:46.261
- Well, I hope y'all
saved room for enchiladas.

1:02:46.263 --> 1:02:49.231
That gazpacho sure was
good, didn't y'all think?

1:02:49.233 --> 1:02:54.269
- The best, you are
amazing Aunt Sallie.

1:02:54.271 --> 1:02:57.205
- If it's not our Anthony,
then what Anthony?

1:02:57.207 --> 1:03:01.009
- You know, only Anthony
I know is my best friend,

1:03:01.011 --> 1:03:04.179
the Duke of the Piney Woods,
two hoots and a holler,

1:03:04.181 --> 1:03:06.882
Anthony Boudreaux Timberlake.

1:03:06.884 --> 1:03:09.084
- Boudreaux Timberlake?
- Boudreaux what?

1:03:09.086 --> 1:03:11.553
- Like the Timberlakes?
- Shut up!

1:03:11.555 --> 1:03:15.190
- Damn you, Mother, why can't
you just leave things alone?

1:03:15.192 --> 1:03:18.493
I'm not a kid, I'm a grown
woman, and I give blowjobs.

1:03:18.495 --> 1:03:20.195
Fuck all of you.

1:03:20.197 --> 1:03:22.364
- Jenny Williker, you
get your butt back here

1:03:22.366 --> 1:03:23.265
and you sit down.

1:03:28.038 --> 1:03:29.237
If you're gonna lie
down with the dogs,

1:03:29.239 --> 1:03:31.139
you better be ready
to get the fleas.

1:03:32.242 --> 1:03:34.509
Papo wouldn't have
talk like that,

1:03:34.511 --> 1:03:36.211
and I won't stand for it either.

1:03:37.981 --> 1:03:39.214
Papo is dead.

1:03:40.517 --> 1:03:44.586
The last time we had Sunday
dinner, Papo was alive.

1:03:47.558 --> 1:03:48.490
He was sitting right
there in that chair.

1:03:53.096 --> 1:03:54.396
Hell, he still is in my book.

1:03:58.869 --> 1:04:01.203
Let's show some
respect, all of you.

1:04:02.239 --> 1:04:04.439
Quit acting like
spoiled schoolchildren.

1:04:06.243 --> 1:04:08.877
Now since this has become
a regular confession,

1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:12.914
Jenny darling, it is
time to come clean.

1:04:12.916 --> 1:04:14.416
What the hell is going on?

1:04:17.254 --> 1:04:18.320
- Truth is,

1:04:20.224 --> 1:04:22.157
Tiger and I are in love.

1:04:25.929 --> 1:04:27.596
I'm sorry, brother.

1:04:27.598 --> 1:04:31.132
I didn't mean to, it's just,

1:04:31.134 --> 1:04:35.637
he's such a good guy and
he's cute and smart and sexy.

1:04:35.639 --> 1:04:38.607
And you know he's
writing a book.

1:04:38.609 --> 1:04:41.877
- Oh, how intellectual of him.

1:04:41.879 --> 1:04:42.878
What kind of book?

1:04:44.281 --> 1:04:48.917
- Um, it's just a
self-help type book.

1:04:48.919 --> 1:04:50.252
- What kind of self help?

1:04:52.422 --> 1:04:55.624
- Well, it's called Dumbalingus,
a Bushwhacker's Guide

1:04:55.626 --> 1:04:57.325
to Oral Satisfaction.

1:04:57.327 --> 1:04:59.661
- Is he some kind of fancy chef?

1:04:59.663 --> 1:05:03.498
- Yeah, Mom, a cookbook.

1:05:03.500 --> 1:05:07.535
The Joys of Eating Stuff.

1:05:07.537 --> 1:05:11.640
- Lots of (clears throat)
tasty recipes there, I'm sure.

1:05:11.642 --> 1:05:13.375
- Damn you, Jenny.

1:05:13.377 --> 1:05:15.911
Out of all the guys in Texas,

1:05:15.913 --> 1:05:19.915
you had to go and pick
my best friend Tiger?

1:05:19.917 --> 1:05:22.384
Do you know how bad that sucks?

1:05:22.386 --> 1:05:24.619
'Cause now I gotta
kill him with karate.

1:05:27.224 --> 1:05:29.124
- He's a fine young man.

1:05:29.126 --> 1:05:31.293
Papo would have been
proud to know him.

1:05:31.295 --> 1:05:32.394
- Thank you.

1:05:32.396 --> 1:05:34.629
- Well, I'm happy for you honey.

1:05:34.631 --> 1:05:36.331
And there's no baby?

1:05:36.333 --> 1:05:37.933
- There is no baby.

1:05:37.935 --> 1:05:40.335
- Well, I think
you got a keeper.

1:05:40.337 --> 1:05:42.037
- When do I get to meet him?

1:05:42.039 --> 1:05:44.572
- When I'm done with him,
no offense, Aunt Sallie.

1:05:44.574 --> 1:05:46.541
- None taken.

1:05:46.543 --> 1:05:50.712
But you know, while we're,

1:05:50.714 --> 1:05:53.615
while we're kind of on
a roll here tonight,

1:05:55.085 --> 1:05:57.953
there's just a little
something that I,

1:05:57.955 --> 1:06:02.390
well, we, um, that...

1:06:02.392 --> 1:06:06.628
- Well, Sallie Mae
McGregor is speechless.

1:06:09.266 --> 1:06:10.632
- Tell her Juan.

1:06:10.634 --> 1:06:13.702
- Oh no, you have
something to share, Sallie,

1:06:13.704 --> 1:06:16.671
you just go on and
tell us yourself.

1:06:16.673 --> 1:06:18.139
- Juan, tell her.

1:06:25.115 --> 1:06:26.014
- Well, (sighs),

1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:30.986
I love Sallie.

1:06:33.557 --> 1:06:36.424
(laughing)

1:06:36.426 --> 1:06:37.492
You're making fun of me.

1:06:39.096 --> 1:06:43.331
- (laughing) Good one,
that's kind of funny.

1:06:43.333 --> 1:06:44.599
- We're in love.

1:06:44.601 --> 1:06:47.168
(laughing)

1:06:51.108 --> 1:06:51.840
- Oh Juan.

1:06:51.841 --> 1:06:52.573
- And we're moving in together.

1:06:52.576 --> 1:06:54.642
(laughing)

1:06:58.315 --> 1:07:00.382
And I'll resign right away.

1:07:00.384 --> 1:07:03.184
(Anthony laughing)

1:07:04.621 --> 1:07:06.054
Everybody stopped laughing.

1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:18.400
Juan and Aunt Sallie.

1:07:21.204 --> 1:07:24.305
Two of my most favorite
people in the world.

1:07:25.409 --> 1:07:29.244
If anybody was to steal
my girl man, I guess,

1:07:29.246 --> 1:07:31.312
I guess it's good that it's you.

1:07:31.314 --> 1:07:34.382
Crazy, that is crazy, man.

1:07:34.384 --> 1:07:39.120
Bowling ball and dust, stardust,

1:07:39.122 --> 1:07:42.290
stardust, baby,
(kisses) stardust.

1:07:44.761 --> 1:07:46.327
- Well, I'm happy for you.

1:07:49.533 --> 1:07:52.167
It's a beautiful thing when
love is found in this world

1:07:52.169 --> 1:07:55.203
and there is no
need to resign Juan.

1:07:56.173 --> 1:07:58.573
I want you both around.

1:08:00.143 --> 1:08:01.476
I love you both.

1:08:04.181 --> 1:08:06.748
- Jeanne Anne, that
is the sweetest thing

1:08:06.750 --> 1:08:08.383
you've said since 1988.

1:08:09.252 --> 1:08:10.251
Oh, we love you JA.

1:08:11.788 --> 1:08:13.388
- Thank you for
your blessing, JA.

1:08:17.094 --> 1:08:19.294
- I wish Papo were
here to see this.

1:08:22.732 --> 1:08:24.833
I forgot to light the candles.

1:08:24.835 --> 1:08:26.534
- You sure did.

1:08:26.536 --> 1:08:27.602
- That'll fix everything.

1:08:33.877 --> 1:08:35.743
- Are you kidding me?

1:08:35.745 --> 1:08:37.445
- What?

1:08:37.447 --> 1:08:40.448
- It says last
will and testament.

1:08:40.450 --> 1:08:41.816
- What?

1:08:41.818 --> 1:08:45.120
- It's dated last week,
the day Papo died.

1:08:45.122 --> 1:08:46.338
- No way.
- You didn't know

1:08:46.339 --> 1:08:47.555
it was there?

1:08:47.557 --> 1:08:50.425
- The stardust, it's
breathing in everyone,

1:08:50.427 --> 1:08:51.826
even you, Mom.

1:08:51.828 --> 1:08:53.528
That is unreal.

1:08:53.530 --> 1:08:54.429
- Read it, Mom.

1:08:56.700 --> 1:09:00.635
- To my old partners
Juan and Jimmy,

1:09:00.637 --> 1:09:03.338
in the old days
around these parts,

1:09:03.340 --> 1:09:06.875
the Comanches would bring
in brave boys, captives,

1:09:06.877 --> 1:09:08.843
and work them to the bone.

1:09:08.845 --> 1:09:12.514
If they survived, they became
equal parts of their family.

1:09:12.516 --> 1:09:14.649
You boys are two
of the best sons

1:09:14.651 --> 1:09:16.818
I could've ever hoped for.

1:09:16.820 --> 1:09:19.787
My land, this stretch
of earth we call home,

1:09:19.789 --> 1:09:23.558
is now yours to
manage as you see fit.

1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:26.861
I have also left you
my cowboy books, guns,

1:09:26.863 --> 1:09:30.365
vehicles, horses,
saddles, livestock,

1:09:30.367 --> 1:09:34.269
and GPS coordinates of my
favorite fishing holes.

1:09:35.472 --> 1:09:36.638
(speaking in a foreign language)

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:37.672
- God, I love that man.

1:09:40.644 --> 1:09:41.876
Jeanne Anne and Jimmy,

1:09:43.513 --> 1:09:47.849
as you know, MeMaw was a
force to be reckoned with.

1:09:47.851 --> 1:09:51.819
Everyone thought we always
got along, but in truth,

1:09:51.821 --> 1:09:54.689
we fought like cats and dogs.

1:09:56.359 --> 1:09:59.494
The question I would
always ask myself

1:09:59.496 --> 1:10:02.330
is what am I more committed to,

1:10:02.332 --> 1:10:05.967
being right or staying married?

1:10:05.969 --> 1:10:08.369
- Lord knows that's the truth.

1:10:08.371 --> 1:10:09.938
- Despite Papo's great wisdom,

1:10:11.474 --> 1:10:14.542
your father and I have
something that we would like

1:10:14.544 --> 1:10:16.344
to tell you.

1:10:18.815 --> 1:10:20.215
We're getting divorced.

1:10:20.217 --> 1:10:20.915
- [All] What?

1:10:22.219 --> 1:10:23.484
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

1:10:23.486 --> 1:10:24.819
- Mom, you have someone else?

1:10:24.821 --> 1:10:26.688
- I do not.

1:10:26.690 --> 1:10:28.990
Our relationship
has become untenable

1:10:28.992 --> 1:10:31.659
and that is all that I can say.

1:10:31.661 --> 1:10:33.628
- Anthony and I
are not surprised.

1:10:33.630 --> 1:10:36.231
We just, we thought
it would be Dad

1:10:36.233 --> 1:10:37.966
that couldn't take
your crap anymore.

1:10:37.968 --> 1:10:41.236
I mean, the way you treat him.

1:10:41.238 --> 1:10:43.304
I'm surprised he put
up with it this long.

1:10:43.306 --> 1:10:45.406
Maybe he'll finally
get his balls back.

1:10:45.408 --> 1:10:50.011
- Well, this philanderer
didn't have any balls.

1:10:50.013 --> 1:10:51.980
- Oh dammit, Jeanne
Anne Williker.

1:10:51.982 --> 1:10:54.816
For once and for all, you
completely deballed the man.

1:10:54.818 --> 1:10:56.684
- Wait, when the hell did
this conversation turn

1:10:56.686 --> 1:10:58.453
to my balls or lack thereof?

1:10:58.455 --> 1:11:03.324
- You know damn well,
Mr. Port A Affair Man.

1:11:04.694 --> 1:11:06.928
Why don't you just grow
a pair and tell everyone

1:11:06.930 --> 1:11:08.763
what you've been up to?

1:11:08.765 --> 1:11:10.598
- Mr. Port A what?

1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:15.570
- Your father has been
spending the last few days

1:11:15.572 --> 1:11:20.441
with his girlfriend at
our condo on the coast.

1:11:21.678 --> 1:11:22.610
Oh yeah (laughs).

1:11:24.314 --> 1:11:27.415
Not even the decency to take
her to the hunting lease

1:11:27.417 --> 1:11:31.486
in Three Rivers, just
right there in my own bed,

1:11:31.488 --> 1:11:33.321
you son of a bitch.

1:11:33.323 --> 1:11:35.690
- Wait a minute, JA,
you got it all wrong.

1:11:35.692 --> 1:11:36.924
You gotta tell her Dad.

1:11:38.061 --> 1:11:40.795
- Well, come on, big boy,

1:11:40.797 --> 1:11:43.564
try to dig yourself
out of this one.

1:11:43.566 --> 1:11:46.034
The head of the Junior
League herself saw you

1:11:46.036 --> 1:11:50.038
gallivanting in and
out all week long

1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:52.740
with some 30-year-old
blonde tramp.

1:11:54.077 --> 1:11:57.412
(laughs) Oh, I've
had it with you.

1:11:57.414 --> 1:11:59.847
Count your blessings
I let you live.

1:11:59.849 --> 1:12:02.383
(laughing)

1:12:13.663 --> 1:12:14.395
- You wanna know?

1:12:15.965 --> 1:12:17.765
Okay, I'll let you know.

1:12:19.469 --> 1:12:21.803
You know how you hate
the lime green and orange

1:12:21.805 --> 1:12:23.338
at the condo in Port A?

1:12:26.743 --> 1:12:28.476
Happy fucking anniversary.

1:12:29.979 --> 1:12:32.914
I hired a decorator to
redo it all as a surprise.

1:12:32.916 --> 1:12:34.048
So fuck you.

1:12:35.719 --> 1:12:39.787
Surprise, I ain't fucking
anyone but myself,

1:12:39.789 --> 1:12:42.390
drinking myself to
sleep trying to forget

1:12:42.392 --> 1:12:43.825
how much I miss poor Papo.

1:12:44.794 --> 1:12:46.427
Selfless son of a bitch.

1:12:47.997 --> 1:12:52.066
I had to lick my wounds and
deal with my loss my way.

1:12:54.971 --> 1:12:56.938
- So you're not cheating on me?

1:12:58.675 --> 1:13:00.575
- Goddammit, what's
the matter with you?

1:13:01.878 --> 1:13:05.713
No, I can't remember
the last time I got any.

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:09.117
- Oh sweetie, oh that is so sad.

1:13:10.887 --> 1:13:13.154
- I thought when you bought
the cow, it was unlimited.

1:13:15.024 --> 1:13:16.057
I'm never getting married.

1:13:21.898 --> 1:13:23.598
- I thought you
made a fool of me

1:13:25.735 --> 1:13:27.502
and left me for another woman.

1:13:29.873 --> 1:13:30.972
Will you forgive me?

1:13:36.413 --> 1:13:38.646
I think I forgot how much
I really do love you.

1:13:50.693 --> 1:13:53.694
- Jeanne Anne, honey,
why don't you finish

1:13:53.696 --> 1:13:56.063
reading the will?

1:13:56.065 --> 1:13:58.166
- You're really
not cheating on me?

1:13:58.168 --> 1:13:59.567
- Just read the damn thing.

1:14:05.108 --> 1:14:06.007
- Okay.

1:14:08.812 --> 1:14:11.512
Relationships are tough.

1:14:11.514 --> 1:14:13.080
You take things for granted.

1:14:14.684 --> 1:14:16.818
I fought through some tough
times and I made it through

1:14:16.820 --> 1:14:18.186
and I'm glad I did.

1:14:19.589 --> 1:14:22.457
A great woman is
like a great horse,

1:14:22.459 --> 1:14:26.994
a high spirit and
helluva companion.

1:14:26.996 --> 1:14:30.765
You get bucked off,
you get back on her.

1:14:30.767 --> 1:14:34.168
Quit is a four-letter word.

1:14:39.542 --> 1:14:40.675
- Dammit, Papo.

1:14:46.015 --> 1:14:47.782
Why do you always
know just what to say

1:14:47.784 --> 1:14:50.184
just before I do
something stupid?

1:14:53.656 --> 1:14:56.123
(gentle music)

1:14:58.561 --> 1:14:59.827
Why didn't you tell
me you were dying?

1:15:02.866 --> 1:15:04.265
Thought I was your best friend.

1:15:07.837 --> 1:15:09.070
- You were his best friend, Dad.

1:15:14.744 --> 1:15:17.011
- Papo knows things.

1:15:17.013 --> 1:15:19.080
I don't know how, but he
sure in the hell does.

1:15:21.618 --> 1:15:25.086
He put that will in that
drawer the day he died.

1:15:25.088 --> 1:15:26.087
Who does that?

1:15:30.693 --> 1:15:31.726
(applauding)

1:15:31.728 --> 1:15:33.227
- Wonderful, you two.

1:15:36.032 --> 1:15:37.999
Does Papo say anything about me?

1:15:41.838 --> 1:15:43.538
- Well, read on, JA.

1:15:43.540 --> 1:15:46.140
I'm sure he consecrates
great Sallie in there, too.

1:15:46.142 --> 1:15:49.844
- To my darling Sallie, honey,

1:15:49.846 --> 1:15:52.880
I paid off the mortgage
and bought you a new Lexus

1:15:52.882 --> 1:15:55.550
down at the dealership.
(Sallie squeals)

1:15:55.552 --> 1:15:56.951
- Holy cow.

1:15:56.953 --> 1:15:59.654
- Talk to Raul, he
will take care of it.

1:15:59.656 --> 1:16:01.322
- Oh my God.

1:16:01.324 --> 1:16:03.925
- I love you, baby, and thanks
for putting a whole bunch

1:16:03.927 --> 1:16:05.960
of big smiles on an old man.

1:16:05.962 --> 1:16:10.064
Signs of a dime hot is a tamale.

1:16:10.066 --> 1:16:14.168
You're one tasty tomato.
- Oh hell no, man.

1:16:14.170 --> 1:16:17.104
- Let me see that, oh
my God, I love that man.

1:16:17.106 --> 1:16:20.207
- Oh my God, Aunt
Sallie, you sexy slut.

1:16:21.077 --> 1:16:22.710
- Oh, thank you sugar,

1:16:22.712 --> 1:16:23.744
- Is that all?

1:16:23.746 --> 1:16:25.279
- Oh, here we go.

1:16:25.281 --> 1:16:29.083
To Anthony and Jenny, I have
set up an educational trust

1:16:29.085 --> 1:16:32.620
for your undergraduate
and graduate education,

1:16:32.622 --> 1:16:34.922
complete with a trip to Europe.

1:16:34.924 --> 1:16:36.691
- Yeah!
- Oh my God!

1:16:36.693 --> 1:16:39.860
- And new cars.
- No way.

1:16:39.862 --> 1:16:43.264
- A man could not hope
for better grandchildren.

1:16:43.266 --> 1:16:45.166
Right now I feel like
when you're bull riding

1:16:45.168 --> 1:16:47.935
and your eight seconds is up,

1:16:47.937 --> 1:16:50.104
you know it's time to get off,

1:16:50.106 --> 1:16:53.140
but you're not quite sure how
or where you're gonna land.

1:16:55.645 --> 1:16:56.978
(speaking in a foreign language)

1:16:56.980 --> 1:16:58.245
Oh, sure babe.

1:16:59.349 --> 1:17:02.350
(Sallie squeals)

1:17:02.352 --> 1:17:04.185
- Sallie!

1:17:04.187 --> 1:17:05.686
- Hey, listen to this.

1:17:05.688 --> 1:17:07.822
I couldn't have asked
for a better life

1:17:07.824 --> 1:17:10.157
or a more loving family.

1:17:10.159 --> 1:17:11.859
Take my ashes out
to the hill country

1:17:11.861 --> 1:17:15.363
in back of Crider's Rodeo
on the Guadalupe River.

1:17:15.365 --> 1:17:19.900
Then I can listen to the
rodeo and dance every weekend.

1:17:19.902 --> 1:17:24.772
Cyprus trees and a spring-fed
river puts a smile on my face.

1:17:27.910 --> 1:17:29.777
- I can smell the
whiskey on his breath.

1:17:31.047 --> 1:17:34.015
- Uh Dad, I think
that's your upper lip.

1:17:34.017 --> 1:17:35.916
(laughing)

1:17:35.918 --> 1:17:40.788
- Oh yeah, but he's
here, I can feel him.

1:17:41.791 --> 1:17:43.991
- Yeah, in the plasma fields.

1:17:46.963 --> 1:17:49.397
What's the rest of it say?

1:17:49.399 --> 1:17:53.934
- It says, I have left donations
to the Charlie Rose show,

1:17:53.936 --> 1:17:57.705
PBS, the NRA, the
Heritage Seed Foundation,

1:17:57.707 --> 1:18:00.307
NPR, and Organization for
Conservative Fiscal and Liberal

1:18:00.309 --> 1:18:02.376
Personal Rights Activism.

1:18:02.378 --> 1:18:04.412
- If that isn't the
most damned mixed bag

1:18:04.414 --> 1:18:05.680
I've ever heard of in my life.

1:18:05.682 --> 1:18:07.214
- He loved that Charlie Rose.

1:18:07.216 --> 1:18:08.416
- He sure did.

1:18:08.418 --> 1:18:10.418
- To Jeanne Anne,
my little girl,

1:18:10.420 --> 1:18:13.154
you have always made your
mother and I so proud.

1:18:13.156 --> 1:18:15.856
We love you so much
with all our hearts.

1:18:15.858 --> 1:18:18.926
Everything else in my
estate goes to you.

1:18:18.928 --> 1:18:20.261
- All right.
- That's wonderful.

1:18:20.263 --> 1:18:22.396
- You got the whole
kit 'n' kaboodle, JA.

1:18:22.398 --> 1:18:24.131
- Mom, that's awesome.

1:18:24.133 --> 1:18:26.767
- Jeanne Anne, do you always
have to be so dramatic?

1:18:26.769 --> 1:18:28.235
Who else would he give it to?

1:18:28.237 --> 1:18:29.904
- Right?
(laughing)

1:18:29.906 --> 1:18:31.772
- Oh look, she's speechless now.

1:18:31.774 --> 1:18:33.274
- Now it's her turn.

1:18:35.111 --> 1:18:36.777
- She's choking!

1:18:36.779 --> 1:18:38.212
- Hey, hey, do the Heimlich,
she's choking, y'all!

1:18:38.214 --> 1:18:40.081
She's choking, oh my God!

1:18:40.083 --> 1:18:42.783
- Oh my God!
- Call 911, call 911!

1:18:42.785 --> 1:18:44.085
- Jeanne Anne!

1:18:44.087 --> 1:18:47.088
Come on, spit it
out JA, spit it out!

1:18:47.090 --> 1:18:48.723
- It's not gonna
come out that way!

1:18:48.725 --> 1:18:50.057
- I'm uncomfortable!

1:18:50.059 --> 1:18:51.158
- JA!

1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:53.894
- What are you doing to her?

1:18:53.896 --> 1:18:55.062
- I think she's dying!

1:18:55.064 --> 1:18:58.499
- Wake up, darling,
wake up baby.

1:18:58.501 --> 1:19:00.768
(sobbing)

1:19:00.770 --> 1:19:03.938
Jeanne Anne, Jeanne
Anne, wake up.

1:19:03.940 --> 1:19:07.041
I'm not done with you baby,
please don't leave me.

1:19:07.043 --> 1:19:08.809
Jeanne Anne, I love you.
- Jimmy, Jimmy,

1:19:08.811 --> 1:19:11.011
do the look, feel, touch.

1:19:11.013 --> 1:19:13.380
- I looked down there,
but I can't see.

1:19:13.382 --> 1:19:15.049
She's not getting any air.

1:19:15.051 --> 1:19:20.121
Jeanne Anne, Jeanne
Anne. (sobbing)

1:19:25.228 --> 1:19:26.160
I gotta frack it down.

1:19:26.162 --> 1:19:28.129
- Frack her, Dad, frack her!

1:19:30.399 --> 1:19:33.300
(Jeanne coughing)

1:19:34.337 --> 1:19:36.003
- Oh God, it worked!
- She's alive!

1:19:36.005 --> 1:19:38.072
- Oh my God!
- Help me!

1:19:38.074 --> 1:19:39.907
- Help me get her up.

1:19:43.212 --> 1:19:45.513
- Oh Jeanne Anne!
- Oh my God.

1:19:45.515 --> 1:19:47.548
- Oh my God, Mom,
that was so scary.

1:19:47.550 --> 1:19:50.351
Dad saved your life,
he fracked you.

1:19:50.353 --> 1:19:52.987
- Baby, don't you
ever do that again.

1:19:56.292 --> 1:19:57.091
- I saw them.

1:19:57.092 --> 1:19:57.891
They were standing right there.

1:19:59.395 --> 1:20:00.394
I talked to them.

1:20:01.831 --> 1:20:03.063
- Who, honey?

1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:05.199
- Papo and MeMaw.

1:20:08.004 --> 1:20:09.236
They hugged me and,

1:20:11.007 --> 1:20:14.909
and said they were fine,
that they loved me.

1:20:14.911 --> 1:20:17.144
And then MeMaw said
that I had to come back

1:20:17.146 --> 1:20:19.914
because y'all needed me.

1:20:22.952 --> 1:20:25.820
They had cocktail
glasses in their hands

1:20:25.822 --> 1:20:27.454
like it was happy hour.

1:20:29.025 --> 1:20:30.357
I felt Papo's breath.

1:20:32.061 --> 1:20:35.229
It smelled like warm whiskey.

1:20:36.465 --> 1:20:39.200
- I told you, Papo's breath.

1:20:39.202 --> 1:20:42.069
- And I smelled MeMaw's
perfume, like two rose bushes

1:20:42.071 --> 1:20:43.070
and a honeysuckle.

1:20:45.308 --> 1:20:50.077
And I looked back and
they raised their glasses.

1:20:51.380 --> 1:20:52.613
They had crushed ice.

1:20:56.118 --> 1:20:58.485
- Mom, I love you, I'm
so glad you're not dead.

1:20:58.487 --> 1:21:00.521
But you gotta hear this.

1:21:02.291 --> 1:21:06.427
According to this, Papo has
executed your wishes, Mom.

1:21:06.429 --> 1:21:11.065
This is from Jeanne Anne,
March 24, 2003, to Papo.

1:21:12.268 --> 1:21:14.268
I think you should read it, Dad.

1:21:16.939 --> 1:21:19.406
(gentle music)

1:21:22.979 --> 1:21:26.113
- Dear Daddy, I thought
about our last discussion

1:21:26.115 --> 1:21:28.949
and I've come to the
following conclusion.

1:21:28.951 --> 1:21:31.352
Jimmy is the most understanding,

1:21:33.289 --> 1:21:37.057
warm loving husband
a woman could have.

1:21:41.264 --> 1:21:43.163
But I feel his
frustration with me.

1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:47.501
I wish I could be the
open, playful partner

1:21:47.503 --> 1:21:51.138
that Jimmy needs, but I'm
just not a free spirit.

1:21:53.476 --> 1:21:56.644
I love Jimmy more than
anything or anyone.

1:21:56.646 --> 1:21:57.912
And I always have.

1:21:59.548 --> 1:22:03.450
Please promise me that if I
ever receive any inheritance,

1:22:03.452 --> 1:22:07.054
I would like it all to
go to Jimmy, all of it.

1:22:08.357 --> 1:22:10.491
Maybe then he'll realize
how much I really love him.

1:22:11.494 --> 1:22:13.560
I know you'll honor my wish.

1:22:13.562 --> 1:22:15.429
Thank you for always
being there for me.

1:22:17.333 --> 1:22:19.199
Your loving daughter,
Jeanne Anne.

1:22:21.337 --> 1:22:24.204
- Well, I'll be damned if a
drought didn't end with a flood.

1:22:25.207 --> 1:22:27.374
You gave him the ranch, baby.

1:22:29.245 --> 1:22:31.578
- Hell honey, I mean, I
don't know what to say.

1:22:33.015 --> 1:22:35.149
You can have it
back, I believe you.

1:22:36.152 --> 1:22:39.386
- I don't want it back.

1:22:39.388 --> 1:22:42.556
I want you to know how
much I really do love you.

1:22:44.994 --> 1:22:45.993
And I always have.

1:22:51.033 --> 1:22:55.035
There is not a material
possession, amount of money,

1:22:55.037 --> 1:22:58.372
or secret fishing hole
than can ever express

1:22:58.374 --> 1:23:01.208
how much I do love you.

1:23:02.244 --> 1:23:04.979
I love this.
(laughing)

1:23:05.681 --> 1:23:08.349
- So do I.
(laughing)

1:23:12.221 --> 1:23:13.620
- But then it doesn't hurt.

1:23:16.292 --> 1:23:19.293
I want you to have it
all and run that ranch,

1:23:19.295 --> 1:23:20.761
just like Papo did.

1:23:22.264 --> 1:23:23.731
- And we'll run it
as one big family,

1:23:23.733 --> 1:23:26.333
Sallie and Juan included.

1:23:27.136 --> 1:23:29.303
- I really do love this family.

1:23:29.305 --> 1:23:32.306
- Wait, Dad, there's more.

1:23:37.446 --> 1:23:39.713
- Okay, Papo wants
us to do a toast.

1:23:39.715 --> 1:23:41.115
Grab your glasses.

1:23:41.117 --> 1:23:42.282
- Oh!
- Are you kidding me?

1:23:47.556 --> 1:23:51.425
- A toast, to love,
health, wealth,

1:23:51.427 --> 1:23:53.727
and plenty of time to enjoy it.

1:23:53.729 --> 1:23:55.696
- [All] To love, health, wealth,

1:23:55.698 --> 1:23:58.298
and plenty of time
to enjoy them.

1:23:58.300 --> 1:24:02.202
(speaking in a foreign language)

1:24:09.645 --> 1:24:13.347
- And with that, my
beloved ones, goodbye,

1:24:15.151 --> 1:24:18.352
and be well until we see you on

1:24:20.756 --> 1:24:22.222
this side of the dirt.

1:24:25.061 --> 1:24:26.527
- This side of the star dirt.

1:24:31.333 --> 1:24:32.266
- Oh baby, I love you.

1:24:36.172 --> 1:24:38.472
- I love you guys, man.

1:24:38.474 --> 1:24:40.641
- I love you, big boy.

1:24:40.643 --> 1:24:43.177
(wistful music)

1:24:55.491 --> 1:24:58.125
¶ It's a long road

1:24:58.127 --> 1:25:01.595
¶ It takes a long time

1:25:01.597 --> 1:25:04.364
¶ You gotta keep a little
faith in this big ol' world ¶

1:25:04.366 --> 1:25:07.201
¶ While it spins along

1:25:07.203 --> 1:25:09.703
¶ You might be fucked up

1:25:09.705 --> 1:25:13.107
¶ Or maybe you're all fine

1:25:13.109 --> 1:25:16.243
¶ Oh you're never gonna know
till the mirror stares back ¶

1:25:16.245 --> 1:25:21.315
¶ And it's satisfied

1:25:21.851 --> 1:25:26.253
¶ You can't leave yet

1:25:26.255 --> 1:25:31.125
¶ Place your bets, there's
so much more to do ¶

1:25:31.494 --> 1:25:33.727
¶ Even though

1:25:33.729 --> 1:25:37.631
¶ It came before you

1:25:37.633 --> 1:25:42.503
¶ 'Cause this side of the
dirt we can make it work ¶

1:25:43.873 --> 1:25:46.240
¶ On this side of
the dirt, you know ¶

1:25:46.242 --> 1:25:49.576
¶ It'll always be a
little bit worse ¶

1:25:49.578 --> 1:25:54.448
¶ On this side of the
dirt, sometimes it hurts ¶

1:25:55.784 --> 1:25:58.418
¶ But this side of
the dirt, at least ¶

1:25:58.420 --> 1:26:03.223
¶ You might fall in
love or find some luck ¶

1:26:03.926 --> 1:26:06.326
¶ Get off your knees

1:26:18.941 --> 1:26:21.775
¶ Can you hear the violins

1:26:21.777 --> 1:26:25.212
¶ That dance in your head

1:26:25.214 --> 1:26:28.382
¶ Ooh sleep tight
my little darling ¶

1:26:28.384 --> 1:26:31.385
¶ That's what she said

1:26:31.387 --> 1:26:33.720
¶ 'Cause tomorrow

1:26:33.722 --> 1:26:36.957
¶ You're gonna stand tall

1:26:36.959 --> 1:26:39.660
¶ And there's a whole
lotta gold in the hills ¶

1:26:39.662 --> 1:26:44.531
¶ And you can have it all

1:26:45.467 --> 1:26:47.834
¶ You can't leave yet

1:26:47.836 --> 1:26:49.603
¶ No

1:26:49.605 --> 1:26:54.474
¶ So place your bets,
there's so much more to do ¶

1:26:55.344 --> 1:26:57.611
¶ And even though

1:26:57.613 --> 1:27:00.547
¶ It came before you
