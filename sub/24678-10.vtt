00:05.873 --> 00:08.251
Narrator:
In New York City war on crime

00:08.275 --> 00:11.654
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.678 --> 00:13.282
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.313 --> 00:15.293
These are their stories.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.455
Harry, I think you're wrong on this one.

00:19.486 --> 00:21.693
If we release the credits to Delhi,

00:21.722 --> 00:23.793
Islamabad won't just sit on its hands.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.668
I don't think we should be
taking on new obligations, Father.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.071
We're a bank, Edward.

00:30.898 --> 00:34.243
That's what we do, take on obligations.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.578
Don't be such a nervous Nelly.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.241
Me, nervous?

00:38.272 --> 00:40.775
You're the one who sees
assassins behind every plant.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.418
I see traitors. There's a difference.

00:45.445 --> 00:46.924
( door opens )

00:46.947 --> 00:49.018
Tell Delhi they have the loan.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.087
If Islamabad squawks, screw 'em.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.826
Time for your shots, Mr. Sternman.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.767
We'll leave you, Harry.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.270
Shame, Edward.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.830
Shame, shame, shame.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.076
Son of a bitch.

01:08.101 --> 01:11.082
I'm surrounded by sons of bitches, Zainer.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.653
(grunts)

01:16.677 --> 01:18.418
So where is she?

01:18.445 --> 01:20.857
She just came back from shopping, she said.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.292
And what about him?

01:22.316 --> 01:25.297
Before your meeting, Edward took
a call from a Mr. Zuckerman.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.799
- I see what's happening.
- (picks up phone)

01:28.922 --> 01:31.562
- I'll get it.
- You can throw all that out. It's junk.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.936
George, is it done yet?

01:33.961 --> 01:35.998
What are you doing for $800 an hour?

01:36.029 --> 01:38.839
- What about this, sir?
- I need it signed end of week.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.401
No, that too.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.074
No excuses. Just get it done!

01:43.103 --> 01:45.242
(phone slams down)

01:45.272 --> 01:48.549
This so-called reinforced door...

01:48.575 --> 01:51.818
- ( knocks )
- How reinforced is it?

01:51.845 --> 01:54.485
You'd need a bazooka to blow it down.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.323
They've got bazookas.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.729
Well, what about the air filters?

01:59.753 --> 02:02.791
Once they're installed, they could
pump cyanide into this place,

02:02.823 --> 02:04.632
it'd be like an offshore breeze.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.535
"Once they're installed"?

02:06.560 --> 02:08.870
Why aren't they installed now?

02:08.895 --> 02:11.273
We're waiting for your son to okay them.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.245
I say they're okay.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.315
What exactly did he tell Knowles?

02:19.339 --> 02:22.445
Something about it had to be
signed by the end of the week.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.582
That stupid old man.

02:25.612 --> 02:28.889
What did he mean by whatever happens?

02:28.915 --> 02:30.792
What's supposed to happen?

02:30.817 --> 02:32.490
Zainer: I don't know.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.795
Edward just said, "Get him
out by the elevator."

02:38.325 --> 02:40.305
What should I do?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.329
Just what he told you.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.742
Where are you going with your
boobs hanging out like that?

02:49.770 --> 02:52.910
Cocktail party at the Met.
I'll be back by 9:00.

02:52.939 --> 02:55.647
Oh, and make sure he takes
one of his little blue pills.

02:57.477 --> 03:00.253
He might just get lucky tonight.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.258
She thinks I'd go near that swamp?

03:06.887 --> 03:09.390
Like she doesn't think
I know where it's been,

03:09.423 --> 03:13.462
that I don't know what's going
on in this house!

03:17.431 --> 03:19.707
Now the Russians,

03:19.733 --> 03:21.474
they'll get all weepy on you,

03:21.501 --> 03:24.072
but they are ruthless SOBs.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.448
Ow! God, watch it, you idiot.

03:26.473 --> 03:28.384
Yes sir, I'm sorry.

03:28.408 --> 03:31.150
What're you stopping for?
My back is still tight.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.783
What is it?

03:33.814 --> 03:35.760
- Do you smell smoke?
- Smoke?

03:35.782 --> 03:37.591
- What is it, Zainer?
- ( alarm beeping )

03:37.617 --> 03:39.654
There's a fire down the hall. I hear noises!

03:39.686 --> 03:41.359
This is it! It's them!

03:41.388 --> 03:43.868
They're coming for me. Zainer, help me!

03:47.094 --> 03:49.631
( beeping )

03:49.663 --> 03:51.199
(bolt clicks)

03:55.669 --> 03:57.774
911, what is your emergency?

03:57.804 --> 03:59.579
They're coming to kill me.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.280
- They're breaking in!
- What is your location, sir?

04:02.309 --> 04:04.448
Hear them? They're trying to get in.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.856
- (thud)
- Sir, I need your location.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.518
- Sternman Towers!
- ( thudding )

04:08.548 --> 04:11.757
For God's sake, hurry!
They're shooting at the door.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.664
Oh God, the smoke is coming in.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.065
Sir, emergency services are on the way.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.625
Bastards! They're killing me!

04:18.658 --> 04:20.069
( loud crack )

04:20.093 --> 04:22.801
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

04:22.829 --> 04:24.467
Sir?

04:25.665 --> 04:27.804
( theme music playing )

04:29.000 --> 04:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:12.913 --> 05:16.122
Man: The building doesn't officially
open for another two months.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.527
Mr. and Mrs. Sternman were the only residents.

05:18.552 --> 05:22.364
We were still working out a few bugs
in the security system.

05:22.389 --> 05:24.995
How elaborate-- the security system?

05:25.025 --> 05:26.800
Alarms on every window,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.670
motion sensors on the roof.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.766
We're on the 90th floor.

05:30.797 --> 05:33.539
Mr. Sternman had whole countries after him...

05:33.567 --> 05:35.274
So he said.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.145
This was his building.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.843
No one was going to drive him out of it.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.510
- Pack this up.
- Okay.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.680
What do you know about
his nurse, Rick Zainer?

05:43.710 --> 05:46.156
Very dependable.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.921
Do you have any idea

05:48.949 --> 05:51.259
why Sternman would lock
himself up in the bathroom?

05:51.284 --> 05:52.763
This was the safe room.

05:52.786 --> 05:56.063
Any emergency, the drill was
he'd lock himself in here.

05:56.089 --> 05:59.036
4-way locks, bulletproof door, firewalls--

05:59.059 --> 06:02.040
Yeah, 911 mentioned shots fired.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.607
- Check for slugs.
- Okay.

06:08.168 --> 06:11.047
Ventilation-- that one of the bugs
you were working out?

06:11.071 --> 06:12.982
Yes.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.350
Why would Sternman run
in here if there was a problem?

06:15.375 --> 06:18.788
I don't know, he was a...

06:18.812 --> 06:20.553
Very unusual guy.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.719
It seems so.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.426
This is the panel that controlled
the security system.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.868
- This is where the fire started.
- In the security system?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.168
If the grim one's going to get you,
he's going to get you.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.470
Did anyone else help this thing along?

06:36.496 --> 06:40.342
I won't know until I get
this panel back to the lab.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.041
Is there any reason
why the sprinklers didn't go off?

06:43.069 --> 06:44.514
We're looking into that, too.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.278
We have another smoke fatality.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.786
In the laundry room-- a maid.

06:51.177 --> 06:54.590
I told him it was fire, but he was
convinced it was terrorists.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.821
He told 911 people were trying to break in.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.993
That could've been me pounding
on the bathroom door

07:01.021 --> 07:03.262
to tell him to come out,
but he wouldn't listen.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.032
Did you see or hear anybody
in or out of the apartment?

07:06.059 --> 07:08.005
No. There was black smoke.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.439
I'm lucky I found the stairs.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.203
How long had you been his nurse?

07:11.231 --> 07:12.301
Six years.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.073
What kind of nursing did he need?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.376
Oh, he was practically a recluse.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.110
He had high blood pressure,

07:18.138 --> 07:20.744
diabetes, arthritis, bad hip, gout--

07:20.774 --> 07:22.447
he took 14 pills a day.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.422
- Any mood-altering drugs?
- Zoloft, Xanax.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.947
( coughs )

07:26.980 --> 07:29.051
He suffered from depression, anxiety--

07:29.082 --> 07:30.891
Sounds like he kept you busy.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.453
He was an interesting man.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.362
All right, Mr. Zainer, thank you.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.095
Goren: Did this woman work
for you, Mrs. Sternman?

07:37.123 --> 07:39.626
Yes, it's her-- it's Aricelli.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.969
Aricelli-- oh God, what's her last name?

07:41.995 --> 07:45.374
- Rick, what's Aricelli's last name?
- DiMarco. What happened to her?

07:45.398 --> 07:48.607
We found her dead of smoke
inhalation in the laundry room.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.945
Did she have anything to do
with starting the fire?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.575
Not as far as we know yet.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.211
Would you have her number?
We need to call her family.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.652
I know it. I'll write it down.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.247
I can't believe this is happening.
This is a nightmare.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.486
Edward, thank God. You got my message.

08:01.514 --> 08:04.552
I was in the car. I heard on the radio
there was a fire. Where's Dad?

08:04.584 --> 08:07.861
Edward, he locked himself in the bathroom.
He died from the smoke.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.525
I'm sorry. Dead?

08:09.556 --> 08:11.399
Oh my God. What started it?

08:11.424 --> 08:13.563
We don't know yet.

08:16.963 --> 08:19.204
My father's dead. I can't--

08:19.232 --> 08:21.178
that's not possible.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.457
The fire was designed to be slow burning

08:34.481 --> 08:36.654
with a maximum of smoke.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.289
The sprinklers had been
disabled in the penthouse

08:39.318 --> 08:41.799
but were still operational
in the rest of the building.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.357
How was the fire set?

08:43.390 --> 08:45.870
Security system has a dedicated phone line

08:45.892 --> 08:47.633
to the security company.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.640
The torch hooked up one end

08:49.662 --> 08:52.700
of an answering machine
circuit board to the phone line

08:52.732 --> 08:55.542
and the other end to an electronic match.

08:55.568 --> 08:59.277
- He dials the number—
- The phone answers, sparks the match

08:59.305 --> 09:02.650
which sets off half a pound
of loosely packed black powder.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.712
Can you trace any of the parts?

09:04.744 --> 09:06.724
Just the electronic match.

09:06.746 --> 09:09.488
9 times out of 10, they melt in the fire,

09:09.516 --> 09:13.362
but we managed to pull
a partial serial number off this one.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.801
I traced the serial number

09:17.824 --> 09:21.271
and got it narrowed down
to two electronics supply houses.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.797
They can tell you who they sold it to.

09:26.633 --> 09:29.637
Eames, I found the guy's workshop back here.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.908
Firebug, firebug, fly away home.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.189
Electronic matches. Buy in bulk and save.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.191
Bag this paper shredder.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.217
Look at this. I make it. It's the warehouse

09:43.249 --> 09:45.855
next to DiSanto's Beef on 11th.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.833
His next gig.

09:53.426 --> 09:57.533
I can't control variables. I can be
the best driver in the world, a guy
steps in front of my car--

09:57.564 --> 10:01.410
This wasn't some guy.
This was my father, Harry Sternman.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.675
Not to mention this poor woman.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.274
You told me all the help
was going to be out by 6:00.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.115
I know what I told you.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.212
I don't know how this could've gone so wrong.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.791
I'm not happy about it either.
I never killed anyone.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.759
You're the expert, you should've known.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.126
Screw that line of thought, my young friend.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.791
And as a point of law,
we're both on the hook for homicide.

10:20.820 --> 10:24.165
Joined at the hip, as it were.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.637
Remember, you and me, Eduardo.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.503
Siamese twins.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.316
Goren: We're staking out the
warehouse and Flynn's apartment.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.012
Deakins: Any leads on who hired him?

10:41.040 --> 10:44.021
Not yet, but we're piecing together
the documents in his shredder.

10:44.043 --> 10:46.387
- What else we got on Flynn?
- A sheet a mile long.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.154
No known associates.
House was rented for cash.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.423
And most of his work was insurance-related.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.590
No homicides until now.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.997
He set a slow-burning fire.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.230
Was he trying to give Sternman
a chance to get out?

10:59.259 --> 11:00.704
Unless the people who hired him

11:00.727 --> 11:03.003
knew Sternman would
lock himself in his safe room.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.635
It's bulletproof, fireproof.
Only way to get him was with smoke.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.804
Who knows what the intent was here?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.973
The crime scene is sending mixed messages.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.449
Maybe somebody on the inside
can set you straight.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.920
(ringing)

11:21.347 --> 11:23.258
Goren.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.096
Man: The patrolmen found him
trying to set the fire.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.536
He reached for something. They opened fire.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.234
- Deakins: What was he reaching for?
- A set of car keys.

11:38.464 --> 11:41.172
Didn't anybody tell them
we needed this mutt alive?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.703
Man: What can I tell you?

11:42.735 --> 11:43.770
So you know,

11:43.803 --> 11:46.909
he primed the sprinkler system
with gasoline instead of water

11:46.940 --> 11:48.749
Whole block would've gone up.

11:48.775 --> 11:51.085
Hell of a barbeque on a Saturday afternoon.

11:51.110 --> 11:54.489
Seabees-- Navy Corps of Engineers.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.620
Yeah, Colin Flynn.
Served two tours in Vietnam.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.960
He won't be setting anymore fires now.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.489
I'm sure the patrolman
who shot him will be glad to hear that.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.736
Zainer: I don't think I can tell you anything.

12:09.762 --> 12:13.335
I signed a confidentiality agreement
when I went to work for Mr. Sternman.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.073
Who's dead, last time we checked.

12:15.101 --> 12:18.446
I need to find another job.
Being indiscreet won't help.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.111
Eames: The agreement cover
only personal matters?

12:21.140 --> 12:24.451
And business-- anything I saw or overheard.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.423
St. Stephan's Prep?

12:26.446 --> 12:28.619
For my sons.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.457
Pretty exclusive.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.930
I was humoring my wife.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.990
The school turned them down anyway.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.130
Mr. Zainer, we're all working stiffs here.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.503
Anything you tell us right
now stays between us.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.007
Please,

12:45.031 --> 12:47.637
you're putting me in a lousy position.

12:48.901 --> 12:52.007
Let's try it like this. What do
you feel comfortable telling us?

12:52.038 --> 12:55.247
Nothing, but that's not an option, is it?

12:55.275 --> 12:58.051
It's good you have a sense of humor about it.

13:00.513 --> 13:05.087
All right, there was some
sort of crisis with the bank.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.998
Mr. Sternman, his son Edward, Mr. Lewis,

13:09.022 --> 13:12.731
they'd been arguing
constantly the last 2 weeks.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.397
Eames: What kind of crisis?

13:14.427 --> 13:16.737
I'm not sure. I overheard something

13:16.763 --> 13:19.676
about calling in loans, insolvency.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.610
Sounds like a cash crunch.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.240
Whatever it was, it was affecting
Mr. Sternman's health.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.274
- That's all I can tell you.
- It's a lot.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.344
- (phone rings)
- That's my wife.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.286
She calls me when she's
on break at the hospital.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.985
Excuse me.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.050
I did a news search of the Sternman Bank.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.289
Nothing about a financial crisis.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.389
If they were in a cash crunch
and trying to raise money,

13:40.420 --> 13:42.331
you figure somebody's going to notice.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.164
If you're looking on Wall Street, sure.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.136
But there's other places to raise money.

13:49.595 --> 13:53.065
Now Sternman Holdings--
that's their real estate company--

13:53.099 --> 13:54.544
they put out a prospectus.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.979
Goren, I'm sorry,

13:57.003 --> 13:59.142
you got to excuse me,
but we just moved in last week

13:59.172 --> 14:01.778
and only one toilet's working
and there's rats in the ceiling.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.345
- Hey, you're making money.
- Yeah, I'm making money--

14:04.377 --> 14:06.379
which in this market is nothing to sneeze at.

14:06.412 --> 14:08.983
So bring some of that money
down to the poker game.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.291
I'm banking it. Carlos and me,

14:11.317 --> 14:12.660
we're saving up for a house.

14:12.685 --> 14:17.191
Carlos? Irene, you're breaking my heart.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.759
You blew your chance.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.734
Ah, here we go.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.739
Yep. Okay.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.904
Bond issues, $2 billion.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.413
This says Azimuth Realty.

14:29.435 --> 14:32.211
Read the fine print,
the properties backing the bonds

14:32.238 --> 14:34.650
are all owned by Sternman Holdings.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.678
So they can raise money without looking
like they're raising money.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.781
These bonds are sold
through outfits like this?

14:39.812 --> 14:42.793
Mm-hmm, and private placements.
Strictly under the radar.

14:42.815 --> 14:46.194
The bonds are backed by the rental income
from the Sternman buildings.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.825
- How are they selling?
- They're not setting any records.

14:48.855 --> 14:52.428
If you don't include the flagship building
in the offering, that sends a message.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.302
The flagship building--
you mean Sternman Towers?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.399
Yeah, right, the one that Sternman died in.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.776
Well, why isn't it part of the package?

15:00.800 --> 15:03.280
That's a good question.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.613
Why don't you ask the people
who put the bond om-:ring together?

15:06.639 --> 15:09.051
Thanks.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.949
I prepared Zainer's severance check.

15:13.980 --> 15:17.291
It's unfortunate we had to let him go.
He was devoted to your father.

15:17.316 --> 15:20.627
If he's so devoted,
why is my father lying in a morgue?

15:20.653 --> 15:22.564
- You tell me.
- What's that mean?

15:22.588 --> 15:25.762
I didn't start that fire.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.164
This is generous.

15:29.195 --> 15:32.267
Didn't his contract stipulate
only four weeks’ severance?

15:32.298 --> 15:34.778
- He has kids, for God's sake.
- Oh, get off your high horse.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.304
- This looks like hush money.
- You sound like my father.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.441
Let's not fight, Edward.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.078
What's done is done.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.746
Harry left enough for both of us.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.279
We don't have to get in each ether's way.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.364
I don't have to talk about this with you.

15:53.386 --> 15:56.367
Actually you do, with us, or
someone from the DA's office.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.630
It's something we have
to keep reminding people.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.433
- Thank--
- This lady here was first.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.406
Woman: Thank you.

16:02.428 --> 16:05.170
Eames: Here's the other way it could go.
We get a subpoena,

16:05.198 --> 16:07.007
we get every cop who isn't nailed down

16:07.033 --> 16:09.604
and a dozen patrol cars
with lights flashing,

16:09.635 --> 16:11.706
a couple command vehicles the size of buses,

16:11.737 --> 16:14.217
and we park them all down here for a day.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.948
You know how nothing
inspires confidence like cops

16:16.976 --> 16:19.115
filling in and out of a broker's office.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.349
We were good to go on the bond offering.

16:23.382 --> 16:26.625
At the last minute, Ed pulled
the Sternman Tower off the table.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.154
Why?

16:28.187 --> 16:31.168
My guess is he wants to sell.
It's their most valuable property.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.931
Easily worth $600 million.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.166
If Ed was looking to cash out,
this was the way to go.

16:35.194 --> 16:37.265
Was the old man on board with this?

16:37.296 --> 16:38.900
No. They were fighting about it.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.935
The Sternman Tower is his legacy.
He poured everything into it.

16:41.968 --> 16:45.415
He wanted to live out his days
in that penthouse.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.009
Looks like he got his wish.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.957
Maybe you should wait until
Mr. Sternman gets back from lunch.

16:54.981 --> 16:59.293
Don't make us explain about
the search warrant again.

16:59.318 --> 17:01.093
AA meeting book.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.566
There are meetings marked off.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.661
If I were in this family,
I'd probably drink, too.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.075
This is good.

17:16.102 --> 17:18.082
Ah, this is very good.

17:19.238 --> 17:22.685
The only way Edward can sell that building
is if the old man cleared out.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.710
So he burned him out.

17:24.743 --> 17:27.816
I'll have to remember this the next time
my mother-in-law comes for a visit.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.418
The ME found the sulfiram
in Colin Flynn's system.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.895
- He had a bottle of it in his basement.
- Sulfiram?

17:32.919 --> 17:34.990
An Antabuse for the treatment of alcoholism.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.023
Flynn and Edward are both alcoholics.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.626
Maybe that's how they met.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.968
Where's Edward's meeting book?

17:40.993 --> 17:43.337
If you're thinking of hitting
the meetings he marked off

17:43.362 --> 17:45.467
to see if anyone saw
them together, forget it.

17:45.498 --> 17:49.036
They call it Alcoholics Anonymous
for a reason. They won't tell you squat.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.810
That's why we're hitting
the coffee shops near the meetings.

17:53.639 --> 17:56.518
This one is Colin Flynn. Sweet guy.

17:56.542 --> 17:59.022
Comes in once a week from the
church across the street.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.457
Haven't seen him in a while.
Is something wrong with him?

18:01.480 --> 18:03.357
Job burnout. How about him?

18:03.382 --> 18:06.056
Oh, yeah, he's every other week.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.861
- Man: Order up!
- Not much of a talker.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.458
They know each other?

18:10.489 --> 18:12.526
I've seen them sit together.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.232
- Are you sure it was these two?
- Yeah, I remember faces.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.003
- Some I'd like to forget.
- Woman: Service, please.

18:18.030 --> 18:21.102
- Thank you.
- Let's go pick up Edward.

18:21.133 --> 18:24.580
Let's see what he has marked down for tonight.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.145
Edward.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.483
What're you people doing here?

18:36.515 --> 18:38.688
They're about to start the meeting.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.956
They have meetings where you're going.

18:41.988 --> 18:44.093
You're under arrest for murder.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.001
Even if your waitress remembers
every mole on his face,

18:51.030 --> 18:52.509
you still have a big problem.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.704
You showed her a single picture of my client.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.736
You tainted her for any future lineup.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.874
You put her on the stand,
I'll rip her to shreds.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.145
Speaking of shreds, we also have this.

19:01.173 --> 19:04.711
It's a fax we found
in Colin Flynn's paper shredder.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.452
- This is very impressive.
- We think so.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.118
It confirms the wire transfer

19:09.148 --> 19:12.721
of $100,000 into his account
from a bank in Dubai.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.823
Lawyer: Dubai? That's in the Persian Gulf

19:14.854 --> 19:17.061
I bet a lot of terrorists
park their money there.

19:17.089 --> 19:21.697
The bank said the money's from a corporate
account in the name of Sternman Corporation.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.400
Lawyer: There’s a half dozen people

19:23.429 --> 19:25.773
who can authorize transfers from that account.

19:25.798 --> 19:29.712
Five... one of whom's your client.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.975
Now if you want to talk deal,

19:34.006 --> 19:36.452
we can have the DA here in five minutes.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.025
This is excellent evidence--

19:44.050 --> 19:45.620
against Colin Flynn.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.688
Like you, we have no doubt

19:47.720 --> 19:50.098
he set the fire in Mr. Sternman's penthouse.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.398
If it wasn't for the
incompetence of his nurse,

19:52.425 --> 19:54.302
who left him barricaded in his bathroom,

19:54.326 --> 19:56.499
Mr. Sternman would've survived.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.601
Tell me, Ed, was it because
you were humiliated?

19:59.632 --> 20:01.407
Is that why you did it?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.072
Lawyer: Detective.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.742
I'm sure when you were young

20:05.771 --> 20:09.082
your dad held you up high above his head.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.145
He was proud of you.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.987
He made you a part of the company.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.549
Yes, so what?

20:15.581 --> 20:18.824
Not so what. The company was in trouble,

20:18.851 --> 20:21.491
your dad wasn't so proud of you anymore.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.932
He made you feel like you let him down.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.958
I let him down?

20:25.991 --> 20:29.871
He made you feel what you suspected
about yourself all along--

20:29.895 --> 20:32.899
that you couldn't quite
measure to good old Dad.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.434
No.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.378
Is that why you drink?

20:36.402 --> 20:38.313
I don't drink.

20:38.337 --> 20:41.113
I've been sober for three years.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.280
What is it they say at AA?

20:45.311 --> 20:47.791
"Keep doing what you've always done,

20:47.813 --> 20:50.123
you'll keep getting what
you've always gotten"?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.826
I didn't kill my father.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.759
They tell you to admit your mistakes--

20:58.791 --> 21:01.704
to make amends to the people you've wronged!

21:01.727 --> 21:03.707
I didn't want him dead.

21:03.729 --> 21:05.572
I'm not responsible.

21:05.598 --> 21:09.045
Look, that's enough. He's
invoking his right to silence.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.391
( door opens )

21:23.382 --> 21:24.918
Stubborn?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.453
He doesn't think he was
responsible for those deaths.

21:27.486 --> 21:29.488
I'm happy to convince a jury otherwise.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.263
I'm not talking legal culpability.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.464
Psychologically, morally, he doesn't
believe he killed his father.

21:34.493 --> 21:38.464
Physically, materially, Mr. Sternman
and Miss DiMarco are dead all the same.

21:38.497 --> 21:40.499
Send him over for arraignment.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.414
If he doesn't think he killed his dad,
who does he think did?

21:48.808 --> 21:50.913
They said I was incompetent?

21:50.943 --> 21:53.549
These people are unbelievable.

21:53.579 --> 21:56.822
Anyway, I got another job-- a better job.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.887
- Boy: Gimme! It's mine!
- Daniel!

21:59.919 --> 22:01.830
Let Matt take a shot!

22:01.854 --> 22:04.528
Matt: See? I told you!

22:04.557 --> 22:07.436
Fair play, it's like a
foreign concept these days.

22:07.459 --> 22:09.461
It's like Edward calling you incompetent.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.236
He can say anything he wants about you,

22:11.263 --> 22:14.073
but you're bound to this
confidentiality agreement.

22:14.099 --> 22:16.978
My wife says my loyalty was to Harry Sternman,

22:17.002 --> 22:19.039
not to the people who might've killed him.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.073
She's got a good point.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.747
Mr. Sternman was having his will re-drawn.

22:24.777 --> 22:28.088
He was on the phone to his
lawyer every day about it.

22:28.113 --> 22:31.560
Edward thought it was because Mr. and Mrs.
Sternman were trying to have a child.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.723
Was the new will going to cut Edward out?

22:34.887 --> 22:36.332
I got that impression.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.564
Go get the ball.

22:39.592 --> 22:42.129
Well, what? What're you waiting for?

22:42.161 --> 22:45.768
Matthew, get over here!

22:47.433 --> 22:50.642
Just get your ball! It's yours.

22:50.669 --> 22:52.478
Don't be scared of them! Come on!

22:52.504 --> 22:54.916
They're just kids in uniforms.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.382
Edward's lawyer accused you

23:02.414 --> 23:04.826
of abandoning Sternman in his bathroom.

23:06.852 --> 23:09.128
What was I supposed to do?

23:09.154 --> 23:11.293
He wouldn't come out, and I didn't have the key.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.597
Anyway, it wouldn't have made a difference.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.004
And why do you say that?

23:16.028 --> 23:17.974
The main elevator was cut off by the fire.

23:17.997 --> 23:21.809
I tried the service elevator-- I punched
in the code, but it wasn't working.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.337
- You're sure you used the right code?
- Yes.

23:24.370 --> 23:27.374
The stairs were the only other way out.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.046
I doubt Mr. Sternman would've made it.

23:34.713 --> 23:38.217
You can't let people like that
intimidate you, okay?

23:38.250 --> 23:41.629
- Sorry, Dad.
- What happened?

23:41.654 --> 23:44.863
Nothing. How was your day?

23:44.890 --> 23:48.337
Long. Look, I picked up the blazers.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.897
I just have to sew on the St. Stephan's crest.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.740
- They look good.
- Have you heard from them yet?

23:53.766 --> 23:56.269
We're just two months away
from the start of school.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.680
I told you, everything's all right.

23:58.704 --> 24:01.184
This is the third year we've applied.

24:01.206 --> 24:04.244
Did they get Mr. Sternman's
letter of recommendation?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.755
I'm sure they did.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.452
What if they didn't?
Maybe you should call the school.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.653
I don't want to sound desperate, okay?

24:10.683 --> 24:13.391
My kids belong in their damn
school and they know it.

24:13.419 --> 24:16.263
So just let me handle it.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.466
There was nothing wrong with the punch
pads or the circuits on that elevator.

24:26.498 --> 24:29.445
If that guy pressed the right numbers,
the elevator should've worked.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.379
Could somebody have changed the code?

24:31.403 --> 24:33.883
Sure. You need a master code and a password.

24:36.842 --> 24:39.083
Okay. The day of the fire,

24:39.111 --> 24:43.059
the service elevator was in heavy use
all day long, tapering off around 5:30.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.789
That's when the workmen went home.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.763
And here, 6:15,

24:46.785 --> 24:49.391
somebody reprogrammed the use code.

24:49.421 --> 24:53.062
- Computer know who?
- Key in S-E-S-77.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.733
Password used was 5-4-5-2-2.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.176
Mrs. Sternman's password.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.378
Anybody who refers to his wife as "that bitch"

25:11.410 --> 25:15.051
and asks you to make sure
that his pre-nup is bulletproof

25:15.080 --> 25:16.957
is not looking to start a family.

25:16.982 --> 25:18.689
And how is the pre-nup?

25:18.717 --> 25:21.220
Very generous to Mrs. Sternman.

25:21.253 --> 25:24.632
Lifetime alimony, townhouse in New York,

25:24.656 --> 25:27.136
home in the Hamptons,
$4 million payment to her

25:27.159 --> 25:29.765
for any instance of
infidelity by Mr. Sternman.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.900
No offense, but who's her lawyer?

25:31.930 --> 25:35.104
( laughs )
The better question is,

25:35.134 --> 25:38.308
what did Mr. Sternman get in return?

25:40.005 --> 25:43.350
"In the event it is proven that
Kit Sternman committed adultery

25:43.375 --> 25:45.651
and that Harold Sternman elects to divorce,

25:45.677 --> 25:47.623
Mrs. Sternman will not be entitled to share

25:47.646 --> 25:50.286
in the marital estate to
any extent whatsoever."

25:50.315 --> 25:53.455
She steps outside the
marriage, she gets nothing.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.988
- Was she cheating?
- I don't know.

25:56.021 --> 25:57.227
Harry didn't say.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.863
He probably kept any
evidence of her infidelity

26:00.893 --> 26:04.397
in a safe place-- a deposit box.

26:04.430 --> 26:08.435
His driver'd know which banks
Mr. Sternman's been to.

26:09.701 --> 26:12.443
Zainer: Sorry to keep you waiting.

26:12.471 --> 26:15.452
Mrs. Liston was being fussy about her nap.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.579
How is it working out?

26:17.609 --> 26:19.816
Good. Thank you for the reference.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.449
Here. Your severance check.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.427
- Oh, you could've mailed it.
- I wanted to see you.

26:25.717 --> 26:28.163
This is too much. I'm only owed four weeks.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.531
I told Edward not to be stingy.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.863
Have the police talked to you?

26:35.894 --> 26:39.467
You don't have anything to worry about.

26:39.498 --> 26:41.705
They're totally focused on Edward.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.843
I have to get back to work.

26:48.874 --> 26:51.377
Goodbye, Kit.

26:51.410 --> 26:54.357
- Are we going to see each other again?
- I don't think so.

26:54.379 --> 26:56.120
You started it.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.862
So I'm ending it.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.992
Anyway, now that Harry's out of the way,

27:05.023 --> 27:07.594
you don't have to sneak around
with the help anymore.

27:19.905 --> 27:22.215
( drilling )

27:36.155 --> 27:38.192
One bed sheet.

27:42.227 --> 27:46.266
B-- B & C group in Maryland.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.801
A lab report from five weeks ago.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.246
"Submitted for testing,
one queen-size bed sheet.

27:51.270 --> 27:54.080
Examination revealed DNA materials
from two individuals.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.417
First subject's DNA was matched
to a sample belonging to Kit Sternman.

27:57.442 --> 28:00.184
Second subject's DNA was contained in semen

28:00.212 --> 28:04.422
and was determined to belong
to a blood relative of Harold Sternman."

28:04.449 --> 28:08.454
Eddie. He's going to have
a lot to talk about at his AA meeting.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.795
Eames: The son and the wife
were having an affair

28:13.825 --> 28:16.465
Sternman found out and he was
taking steps to cut them loose.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.873
It never occurred to him
they might conspire to kill him?

28:18.897 --> 28:20.843
He obviously wasn't paranoid enough.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.472
You still have your reservations
about the son?

28:23.502 --> 28:25.345
It's adding up even less.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.374
Bedding your father's trophy wife
right underneath his nose,

28:28.407 --> 28:30.216
it's an act of rage, contempt.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.915
It’s bold.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.515
Would someone like that kill
with a slow-burning fire?

28:34.546 --> 28:36.856
Maybe it was Mrs. Sternman's contribution.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.328
As long as one of them thought it,
it's a conspiracy.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.560
- Assuming they're in it together.
- They were on that bed sheet together.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.898
Don't tell me you're disputing
the DNA evidence?

28:44.923 --> 28:46.596
The night of the fire-- you saw them--

28:46.625 --> 28:48.832
they sat next to each other.
No look, no touch,

28:48.860 --> 28:51.670
not a single molecule of complicity
passed between them.

28:51.697 --> 28:54.541
Detective, the facts here
speak for themselves.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.570
The facts are up for grabs, Counselor.

28:57.603 --> 28:59.776
The facts support a charge of conspiracy

28:59.805 --> 29:01.580
against Kit and Edward Sternman.

29:01.607 --> 29:02.881
That's what I'm going with.

29:10.148 --> 29:12.287
Eames: Back to my yes-or-no question,

29:12.317 --> 29:13.853
did you change the code?

29:13.885 --> 29:16.866
Yes or no? Then, no.

29:16.888 --> 29:19.129
How do you explain that
your password was used?

29:19.157 --> 29:22.730
Other people have it-- Berger,
the security person, and Edward.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.434
Why would they use your password?

29:24.463 --> 29:27.069
To get me in trouble,
which they've succeeded in doing.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.045
How would Edward have gotten your password?

29:29.067 --> 29:32.105
I don't know. Ask him. This
is a ridiculous conversation.

29:32.137 --> 29:35.084
Which we're under no obligation
to continue. We're leaving.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.780
Mrs. Sternman...

29:38.810 --> 29:41.347
Were you and your husband still intimate?

29:41.380 --> 29:43.121
What?

29:43.148 --> 29:46.755
- Kit—
- Harry and I had a very healthy sex life.

29:46.785 --> 29:51.495
Hmm, arthritic, diabetic 68-year-old Harry

29:51.523 --> 29:54.868
with the bad... ticker?

29:56.862 --> 30:00.605
And a big bottle of wonderful
little blue pills.

30:02.067 --> 30:05.105
- Oh, come on.
- Every day, Detective.

30:06.371 --> 30:08.214
Sometimes twice a day.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.312
He must've gone through
those pills like candy.

30:11.343 --> 30:15.348
We found his stash in his bathroom.

30:17.215 --> 30:20.788
60 pills for 40 days.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.723
Why don't we see how busy
the two of you were?

30:24.756 --> 30:28.670
-( Kit laughs)
- Lawyer: This is the most outrageous
conduct I've ever seen.

30:28.694 --> 30:30.935
Kit, let's go.

30:30.962 --> 30:32.942
- That's 10...
- ( Kit chuckles )

30:32.964 --> 30:35.672
- ...20
- Count all you want!

30:35.701 --> 30:38.477
30-- there's still plenty here.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.416
Don't think for a minute
that you can intimidate me.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.114
46, 48--

30:44.142 --> 30:45.883
It doesn't prove anything.

30:45.911 --> 30:47.913
My husband and I were happy.

30:50.282 --> 30:53.491
The why did he ask his lawyer
to review the pre-nup...

30:53.518 --> 30:55.657
2 weeks before he was killed?

30:55.687 --> 30:58.497
How would I know? He's crazy.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.527
Crazy like a fox. We read
clause 17 of the pre-nup--

31:01.560 --> 31:04.734
the one where you don't get a nickel
if he proves you committed adultery.

31:04.763 --> 31:07.209
Since I was never unfaithful,
there's no proof.

31:07.232 --> 31:08.734
Eames: Actually, there is.

31:08.767 --> 31:12.112
A stained bed sheet that we
found in a safe deposit box

31:12.137 --> 31:16.347
with your DNA, and the DNA of a man
not your husband.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.182
You're free to leave, Mrs. Sternman,

31:21.213 --> 31:24.217
but whether from you or from your
stepson, we will get the truth.

31:24.249 --> 31:26.422
My stepson? What does Edward
have to do with me?

31:26.451 --> 31:29.091
The DNA on the sheet was his.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.330
What? Y-you think Edward and I--

31:34.359 --> 31:36.236
you're crazier than Harry.

31:36.261 --> 31:37.467
Edward's gay.

31:39.030 --> 31:42.273
I never told Harry. He had no clue.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.439
Lawyer: And neither, evidently, do you.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.459
Edward's the only living
male relative Sternman had.

31:58.483 --> 32:00.224
This lab that did the original test?

32:00.252 --> 32:02.732
Very reputable. Used by law
enforcement in five states.

32:02.754 --> 32:06.361
I'll get a court order for Edward's blood
and have our lab run a comparison,

32:06.391 --> 32:08.496
make sure we get our facts straight.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.973
Edward could be playing for both teams.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.772
Sternman's prescriptions for Zoloft and Xanax

32:13.799 --> 32:16.439
were renewed a month
early. I counted the pills.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.141
He was doubling up.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.446
That can't be too healthy.

32:20.472 --> 32:23.180
He would've been booming and zooming,

32:23.208 --> 32:25.188
manic, paranoid.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.315
No wonder he thought everybody was after him.

32:34.419 --> 32:35.864
Right...

32:35.887 --> 32:39.562
The perfect prescription for paranoia.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.881
There you go, dear.

32:56.174 --> 32:58.381
Now let me bring you near the window

32:58.410 --> 32:59.889
so you can get some sun.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.322
Her color seems better.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.724
I appreciate everything you've
been doing for my mother.

33:03.748 --> 33:06.422
Thank you.

33:06.451 --> 33:09.091
Can I ask you a favor?

33:09.120 --> 33:12.727
I'm applying to get my sons into St.
Stephan's for the winter semester.

33:12.757 --> 33:14.862
- To St. Stephan's?
- Yes, on a scholarship.

33:14.893 --> 33:17.669
- I know your husband went to St. Stephan's.
- Yes.

33:17.696 --> 33:21.075
Is it possible I could speak to
him about it for a few minutes?

33:21.099 --> 33:23.602
I can ask him. He's leaving
for London tonight.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.808
I'll mention it when he gets back, all right?

33:25.837 --> 33:29.114
Sure, whenever's convenient.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.313
Thank you.

33:36.147 --> 33:38.593
I wasn't aware my father
was changing his will.

33:38.617 --> 33:41.530
Goren: We're off on the wrong
foot here, Mr. Sternman.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.863
I came alone. I'm not wearing a wire.

33:43.889 --> 33:46.233
The only witness we have here is your lawyer.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.431
Whatever you tell me, you can deny later.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.771
So let's not blow smoke.

33:53.932 --> 33:57.004
Okay, let's assume he knew
his father was changing the will.

33:59.104 --> 34:00.947
And why do you think he was changing it?

34:05.744 --> 34:09.715
He wanted to favor the child
that he and Kit were trying to conceive.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.719
Would you like to know the real reason?

34:17.389 --> 34:20.427
He thought you were having an affair with Kit.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.404
He even had proof

34:22.427 --> 34:25.840
A bed sheet with Kit's DNA
and your semen. That's the lab test.

34:28.266 --> 34:31.270
That-- that's not possible.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.679
Because...

34:34.706 --> 34:36.686
You're gay.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.655
Yes...

34:41.679 --> 34:44.889
Among other reasons.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.522
Even if I were remotely attracted to Kit,

34:47.552 --> 34:49.690
I wouldn't do that to my father.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.723
This test, it's wrong.

34:53.958 --> 34:56.599
There's something else you should know.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.801
Kit changed the code on the service elevator

34:58.830 --> 35:00.832
the night of the fire...

35:03.435 --> 35:06.575
To trap your father in the penthouse.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.745
The DA thinks that this is
further evidence

35:09.774 --> 35:12.687
that she conspired with you
to kill your father.

35:17.649 --> 35:21.256
In the hypothetical,
you never told her about the fire.

35:21.286 --> 35:25.098
Edward, I'm advising you
not to say another word.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.765
No, I didn't tell her.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.811
Told someone else, didn't you?

35:36.067 --> 35:39.048
To warn them to save your father?

35:50.281 --> 35:52.261
Ah, thank you for coming in.

35:52.283 --> 35:55.492
Our investigation has run into a brick wall.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.591
We really need some help.

35:57.622 --> 35:59.397
Whatever I can do.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.335
Here's the problem,

36:01.359 --> 36:03.737
we think Edward and Kit Sternman

36:03.762 --> 36:06.072
conspired to kill Mr. Sternman.

36:06.097 --> 36:08.373
Mrs. Sternman?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.743
Why do you think that?

36:09.768 --> 36:11.805
She changed the code on the service elevator.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.509
That's why you couldn't get it to work.

36:13.538 --> 36:16.678
And we suspect that she and Edward
were having an affair.

36:16.708 --> 36:20.155
But we don't have enough proof of it,
so if you know anything...

36:22.614 --> 36:25.185
There's a bed sheet they used.

36:25.216 --> 36:27.059
I brought it to Mr. Sternman's attention.

36:27.085 --> 36:28.530
Eames: What did he do with it?

36:28.553 --> 36:30.294
I think he put it in a safe deposit box.

36:30.321 --> 36:34.030
Well, it's probably long gone by now.

36:34.059 --> 36:36.039
No, he saved it.

36:36.061 --> 36:38.166
There’s a clause in their pre-nup,

36:38.196 --> 36:41.507
she doesn't get anything if he can prove
she cheated on him.

36:44.002 --> 36:47.609
Well, that's very helpful.
( laughs )

36:47.639 --> 36:50.620
Why didn't you mention this to us before?

36:50.642 --> 36:53.953
Mr. and Mrs. Sternman
have been good to me over the years.

36:53.978 --> 36:56.390
- And you felt conflicted.
- Yes.

36:56.414 --> 37:00.863
You thought that maybe we'd find out
on our own eventually.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.364
Yes.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.799
Guess what?

37:06.791 --> 37:09.738
It has Kit's DNA and Edward's.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.970
But you knew that since you put it there.

37:14.632 --> 37:16.236
What're you talking about?

37:17.669 --> 37:21.242
You are truly the most--
what's the right word?

37:21.272 --> 37:23.752
--driven person that I have ever come across.

37:23.775 --> 37:26.949
That you would actually have sex with Edward

37:26.978 --> 37:29.322
to get a sample of his semen,

37:29.347 --> 37:32.123
that shows incredible...

37:32.150 --> 37:33.925
Determination.

37:33.952 --> 37:36.125
That's a damn lie.

37:36.154 --> 37:37.690
Edward told us.

37:37.722 --> 37:40.498
Hey, Rick, it's no crime--

37:40.525 --> 37:44.473
not even smearing his semen on the bed sheet.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.066
Why the hell would I do that?

37:46.097 --> 37:50.068
To convince Mr. Sternman that his wife
and his son had turned against him.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.445
You were pumping him
so full of Zoloft and Xanax,

37:52.470 --> 37:55.007
- he was ready to believe anything.
- That's absurd!

37:55.039 --> 37:57.918
Eames: You told Kit her husband
found out she was having an affair

37:57.942 --> 38:01.321
And she believed you
because she was having an affair...

38:01.346 --> 38:02.757
With you.

38:02.781 --> 38:06.126
Eames: You told Edward his father
was cutting him out of his will

38:06.151 --> 38:08.153
because he was gonna have another kid.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.894
Goren: You set them both
up against each other.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.903
It was only a matter of time
before somebody ended up dead.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.428
And they'd all take the fall.

38:18.196 --> 38:19.937
It's brilliant!

38:19.964 --> 38:23.969
Between us, it's the perfect crime.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.149
Because you really--

38:29.174 --> 38:32.678
you didn't do anything really criminal,

38:32.710 --> 38:34.348
did you?

38:34.379 --> 38:36.518
No. No, I didn't.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.687
That's right, not even when...

38:38.716 --> 38:41.595
Edward warned you to get
his father out by the elevator.

38:41.619 --> 38:44.395
How was I supposed
to know he was going to set a fire?

38:44.422 --> 38:47.699
You couldn't. Maybe Kit had
an idea when you told her,

38:47.725 --> 38:50.797
that's why she changed the code.
But you, you were just an employee.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.241
It wasn't your job to question them.

38:53.264 --> 38:54.675
No, it wasn't.

38:54.699 --> 38:57.373
If Mr. Sternman wants
to lock himself up in the bathroom,

38:57.402 --> 38:59.075
that's his business, right?

38:59.103 --> 39:01.583
- There was nothing I could do.
- What do you care?

39:01.606 --> 39:06.146
This old man who couldn't wipe
his own ass without you.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.181
He wouldn't lift a finger to help
get your sons into St. Steven's.

39:09.214 --> 39:11.490
It's Stephan's.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.730
He told you he was going to write...

39:17.755 --> 39:20.235
A letter to the school...

39:21.526 --> 39:23.733
Use his influence.

39:24.762 --> 39:26.207
Never did.

39:26.231 --> 39:29.337
No. It was just a damn letter.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.277
That must've burned you,

39:36.307 --> 39:38.719
the utter thoughtlessness,

39:38.743 --> 39:42.316
while you-- you made sure
he took his pills every day,

39:42.347 --> 39:44.156
you massaged his dry old skin,

39:44.182 --> 39:46.321
you monitored his every little burp.

39:46.351 --> 39:47.591
That's right.

39:47.619 --> 39:51.658
You put up with all the little indignities
of servicing his personal hygiene.

39:51.689 --> 39:54.295
You wanted something better for your kids.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.430
Yes. The old bastard.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.847
He treated you like--

40:04.869 --> 40:06.906
like something...

40:06.938 --> 40:08.815
He scraped off his shoe.

40:20.618 --> 40:23.189
But you showed him.

40:23.221 --> 40:25.292
You played him.

40:25.323 --> 40:27.303
Played the whole family

40:27.325 --> 40:30.306
like a fine violin.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.538
They were easy, so wrapped up in themselves.

40:40.338 --> 40:42.340
The perfect crime.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.552
Well, you said so yourself,

40:46.577 --> 40:49.854
I really didn't do anything criminal, did I?

40:55.820 --> 40:58.528
You're a registered nurse, right?

41:00.258 --> 41:03.068
Had a contract with Sternman
to provide care?

41:04.095 --> 41:05.631
Yes.

41:11.402 --> 41:13.780
What?

41:13.805 --> 41:16.115
You heard about the lifeguard
on Jones Beach,

41:16.140 --> 41:19.644
who let a drowning man die 'cause
he was too busy talking to a girl?

41:19.677 --> 41:22.089
- They convicted him.
- Eames: Manslaughter.

41:22.113 --> 41:25.356
He had a higher standard
of duty than other people.

41:25.383 --> 41:27.329
He couldn't just walk away.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.223
Neither could you.

41:30.254 --> 41:31.961
What are you talking about?

41:33.291 --> 41:35.202
Your contract.

41:35.226 --> 41:38.673
"Richard Zainer agrees to provide
the nursing services listed above,

41:38.696 --> 41:43.236
and to care for the health and welfare
of Harold Sternman."

41:43.267 --> 41:45.679
You watched the forces

41:45.703 --> 41:48.343
gather around Sternman to kill him.

41:51.743 --> 41:53.518
But I didn't do anything.

41:53.544 --> 41:57.515
That's right. You did nothing.

41:57.548 --> 41:59.255
You watched it happen.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.524
And that, my friend...

42:01.552 --> 42:03.657
Is manslaughter.

42:15.733 --> 42:17.178
But he owed me.

42:17.201 --> 42:20.148
He owed you the salary he paid you.

42:31.182 --> 42:33.685
( handcuffs clanking )

42:33.718 --> 42:36.324
Zainer pleaded to second-degree manslaughter,

42:36.354 --> 42:38.960
Edward Sternman to arson
and two counts of man one,

42:38.990 --> 42:40.970
and Kit Sternman to attempted murder.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.972
Deakins: Quite the trifecta.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.031
Zainer can be proud of himself.

42:45.063 --> 42:47.134
He brought down a banking empire.

42:47.165 --> 42:49.736
Not to mention a family.

42:51.769 --> 42:53.908
Three families.

42:59.844 --> 43:01.983
