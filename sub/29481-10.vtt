a serial killer investigation.

11:10.626 --> 11:11.888

is decreasing,

out how this guy's brain works.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.379
Find patterns in his behavior.

- The more information we have,
the more specific I can get,

11:26.773 --> 11:28.731
but at first glance,
our killer's got a type--

11:28.775 --> 11:30.864
red hair, slim,
around the same age.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.430
- So he's an opportunist.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.302
Grabs 'em when he sees 'em?
- Exactly.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.391
He's moving around
acting on impulse

11:36.434 --> 11:38.436
rather than planning
careful executions,

11:38.480 --> 11:41.352
which could be good for us.
More likely he made mistakes.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.745
- So, uh,
where should we start?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.616
- At the beginning
of his killing spree.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.402
He was probably less skillful,
less careful,

11:47.445 --> 11:50.013
and look for connections
between the victims--

11:50.057 --> 11:53.277
patterns in their
backgrounds and behavior

11:53.321 --> 11:55.802
that would've made
them appealing targets.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.675
- Five women,
five different jurisdictions.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.285

So, listen, I screwed up in my
live fire training yesterday,

12:08.815 --> 12:12.906
- What happened?
- Uh, I left Scola uncovered.

12:12.949 --> 12:16.431
It was just for a second, but
Orstad stopped the whole test,

12:16.474 --> 12:18.607
and he called me out
in front of everyone.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.652
- Well, of course.
- Yeah.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.393
- But you know, I tried
talking to Scola about it,

12:22.437 --> 12:25.396
and he was--I don't know,
he just brushed t off.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.485
- Well, then maybe
it wasn't that big of a deal.

12:27.529 --> 12:30.750
- Maybe, but I wonder if he's
going a little too easy on me.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.621
- Why?
- Like, would he be

12:32.664 --> 12:34.884
so nice to me if I were a man?
- Oh--

12:34.928 --> 12:38.932
Yeah, I--
I don't know Scola very well.

12:38.975 --> 12:42.979
But there are some men who can
definitely be patronizing,

12:43.023 --> 12:45.329
I mean,
especially in the beginning.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.549
- So, what do I--
what do I do about that?

12:48.811 --> 12:50.552
- I had to take my ego
out of the equation.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.641
I just listened
to what they had to say.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.861
Some of the advice was great,
some of it I didn't take on,

the day,

12:56.688 --> 12:58.516
when you're out in
the thick of it,

12:58.560 --> 13:00.780
you're gonna be relying
on your own instincts.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.567
That being said,

13:05.610 --> 13:08.396
you really do need to stick
closer to Scola in the field.

13:08.439 --> 13:11.442
Because not reading off your

16:36.212 --> 16:38.040
from school

He was raised
as the kidnapper's son

He was abused and molested

16:42.610 --> 16:45.569
for six years
before he managed to escape.

16:45.613 --> 16:48.094
- Andrew fits the profile
of a disorganized killer.

16:48.137 --> 16:52.054
What he went through--abusers
are often victims of abuse,

16:52.098 --> 16:54.056
and Andrew grew up
in an unstable environment

16:54.100 --> 16:56.711

during his formative years.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.148

16:59.192 --> 17:01.629

around killing people?

17:01.672 --> 17:04.675
- Could be his way of regaining
the control he lost as a child.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.895
- He was in and out of rehabs
for years.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.331
Alcohol, amphetamines--

17:08.375 --> 17:10.333
- It all points to
a lack of impulse control.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.901
- The entire nation feels
protective of this kid,

17:12.944 --> 17:16.252
so we need more than a strong
profile to go after him.
