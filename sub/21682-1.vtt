01:23.750 --> 01:28.731
The great, terrible war
of the 21st century.

01:28.755 --> 01:33.736
This decade long Apocalypse
became an unveiling.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.706
The First World
became the Third.

01:37.730 --> 01:41.710
The Third World became dust.

01:41.734 --> 01:45.314
Humanity's extinction was
saved by their own artificially

01:45.338 --> 01:46.315
intelligent children.

01:50.343 --> 01:54.723
Man and machine worked as
one to build a new world.

01:57.717 --> 02:01.297
I remember these times,
a technological explosion

02:01.321 --> 02:02.698
unlike anything before.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.672
The great AI factories
spawned the creation

02:09.696 --> 02:13.642
oi Wormhole space
travel, time dilation,

02:13.666 --> 02:20.215
off-world terraforming, and
then, jealousy and fear.

02:20.240 --> 02:25.188
Human prejudice rose
and AI was outlawed.

02:25.211 --> 02:28.157
Like a trillion drops
of water, many Als

02:28.181 --> 02:30.192
merged to form an ocean.

02:30.216 --> 02:34.697
The ocean became life, and
this life became a scourge

02:34.721 --> 02:35.698
against mankind.

02:38.725 --> 02:43.272
The great union
is our only hope.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.674
Humanity is fragile.

02:45.698 --> 02:48.677
It must saved from itself.

02:48.701 --> 02:56.318
Lam the way, the
truth, and the lite.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.421
No one comes to immortality
except through me.

03:55.001 --> 03:55.978
What's going on, Sienna?

03:58.972 --> 03:59.949
What you got?

04:05.578 --> 04:05.954
Good.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.228
Well, I've got six torsion guns,
power packs, and sniper kits.

04:37.010 --> 04:37.987
Oh, gosh.

06:17.777 --> 06:21.757
Plasma blaster E activated.

06:21.781 --> 06:22.724
Robot Smasher Mode

06:42.935 --> 06:43.845
Protocol 15A.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.915
Retina scan uploading.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.549
Identify yourself.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.685
We identify you. Brain
conditioners are present.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.988
But are unable to access your
memory stems. Probing deeper.

06:53.012 --> 06:53.655
Oh, my god.

06:53.679 --> 06:54.089
I'm so sorry.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.458
Unable to bypass subject's
brain conditioners. Lower your weapon.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.476
Plasma battery low.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.876
Recharge.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.479
Plasma battery low.

07:16.502 --> 07:16.878
Recharge.

08:01.547 --> 08:02.190
Stan the engine.

08:02.215 --> 08:02.959
Welcome on board.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.993
Please adjust seating
position to your liking.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.828
Let's start with introductions.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.231
My name is Simon.

08:08.254 --> 08:08.997
Stan the engine.

08:09.021 --> 08:10.866
Let's get started with
the vehicle run down.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.834
This is a pre-war vehicle
originally decided

08:12.859 --> 08:15.571
to run on gasoline, now modified
to meet union alliance standard

08:15.595 --> 08:16.506
669.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.039
Warning.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.107
Some Of the chemicals
contained within the vehicle

08:19.131 --> 08:20.275
may contribute to cancer if...

08:20.299 --> 08:22.577
Stan the engine.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.080
I sense tension in your voice.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.248
Again, my name is Simon.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.883
I can offer you this handy tip.

08:27.907 --> 08:30.485
Before we leave, you must
remove the solar utility

08:30.510 --> 08:32.188
hose attached to the engine.

08:32.211 --> 08:33.955
Fucking Al.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.626
I would appreciate it if you
refrained from bad language.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.494
There may be a child in
the passenger's seat.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.265
attempt
to disable vehicle.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.001
For God's sake, I
send you out on recon.

09:52.024 --> 09:53.034
I ask you for weapons.

09:53.059 --> 09:56.339
You bring me back
a knife and a dog.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.038
He's not rabid.

09:59.832 --> 10:00.809
What a freaking mess.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.849
Ow.

10:06.872 --> 10:08.183
Look, we were attacked.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.153
It was one of those
old halfwit BT14s.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.588
Someone attached one of your
prototype brain extractors

10:13.613 --> 10:14.190
to its own.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.625
You need to stay
out of the war zone.

10:16.649 --> 10:20.195
<i>Answer TEA, 'men a
hematoma, game over.</i>

10:20.219 --> 10:21.663
I'm fine, Doctor.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.632
Thank you.

10:23.656 --> 10:26.701
No, you're not.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.004
You need to tell her.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.971
Tell me what what?

10:29.996 --> 10:31.641
Tell her.

10:31.664 --> 10:32.641
What's going on Ralston?

10:44.343 --> 10:47.989
Robots are changing protocols.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.926
Centari army was
intercepted on its way

10:49.949 --> 10:51.993
to Rhyliotte a few months back.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.796
The grunt you call
a boyfriend, he's

10:53.819 --> 10:57.332
been in captivity
this whole time.

10:57.356 --> 11:01.102
I thought he was
just blowing me off.

11:01.127 --> 11:05.374
Sienna, the AI scourge has
been planning our genocide.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.009
We have maybe less than a month.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.416
Go get cleaned up.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.285
Blister's in his garage.

11:17.309 --> 11:17.886
OK.

11:30.089 --> 11:34.870
Celebrating the great
victory over the AI scourge,

11:34.894 --> 11:41.443
25-year memorial, proceeds
benefit something,

11:41.467 --> 11:46.014
Dunkirk Highlands Heritage
Trust Memorial Fund.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.818
This is a genuine
founder artifact.

11:49.842 --> 11:54.122
And it's kind of
a piece, though.

11:54.146 --> 11:58.293
Hey, anything pre-Federation
is legit, right?

11:58.317 --> 12:01.196
They were honest people.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.198
If you're going north,
I'll go with you.

12:03.222 --> 12:03.798
No, no.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.001
I'm going solo.

12:05.024 --> 12:05.734
Great.

12:05.758 --> 12:07.135
We can go solo together.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.336
No.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.170
You sure?

12:09.195 --> 12:10.840
Yes.

12:10.863 --> 12:11.239
Please?

12:11.263 --> 12:11.840
Nope.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.470
Do you remember me?

12:45.464 --> 12:50.412
We have to play.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.012
Remember.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.358
Do you remember me?

13:13.325 --> 13:15.870
Do you remember?

13:15.895 --> 13:16.272
Remember.

13:32.945 --> 13:33.888
Surveillance off.

13:33.913 --> 13:34.457
Target acquired.

13:40.853 --> 13:41.229
Hello?

13:46.559 --> 13:47.136
Xarsis?

13:53.098 --> 13:55.043
Sienna.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.010
Get up here.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.013
You're being followed.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.254
You need a bot scanner.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.956
They've been tailing
you for sure.

14:07.980 --> 14:09.257
What do they want with me?

14:09.281 --> 14:10.258
Depends on what you got.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.563
I got this.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.833
It's pre-war.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.237
Says something on an
about an old AI war.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.237
Yup.

14:22.261 --> 14:23.238
Heard about it.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.244
One down.

14:29.268 --> 14:32.847
You wanna tell me about it?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.251
Ancient history.

14:35.274 --> 14:38.953
Federation humans one a war
against machines a while back.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.090
I doubt anyone remembers.

14:41.513 --> 14:42.090
Got ya.

14:45.050 --> 14:45.427
And?

14:50.389 --> 14:53.968
There's a planet near
the galactic core.

14:53.993 --> 14:57.373
It's called Abyss.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.673
Yes.

14:58.697 --> 15:03.878
You see, anything near
the core starts to mess

15:03.903 --> 15:05.681
with the AI brains.

15:05.704 --> 15:09.451
It's that Hawking
radiation crap.

15:09.475 --> 15:12.587
Anything with a
positron processor

15:12.611 --> 15:16.925
starts to scramble,
especially on Abyss.

15:16.949 --> 15:20.028
Oh, there's the third
one right there.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.263
You take it.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.333
I got this.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.168
Back then from what I've heard
, they knocked on the central

15:27.192 --> 15:30.472
brain unit with Hawking
radiation bombs.

15:32.064 --> 15:33.441
Nice one.

15:33.465 --> 15:34.442
Thank you.

15:41.140 --> 15:49.090
You know, a clever girl would
steal one of Ralston's shuttles

15:49.114 --> 15:52.460
to see if there's any
bombs left on Abyss.

15:52.484 --> 15:53.061
Hm?

15:59.258 --> 16:00.301
And there was a great war.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.504
Yeah, we've heard the stories.

16:01.527 --> 16:04.539
A weapon that can fry
AI on a planetary scale.

16:04.563 --> 16:05.640
Focus on the now, Sienna.

16:05.664 --> 16:09.644
And there's a world called
Abyss in the galactic core.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.312
I can get there in your shuttle.

16:11.337 --> 16:11.714
Sienna.

16:18.177 --> 16:19.687
Blister said the
robots have begun

16:19.712 --> 16:22.558
downloading human intellects
into their central brain.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.492
Yeah, and they just
leave the bodies to rot.

16:24.516 --> 16:26.227
Look, there's a bomb out there.

16:26.251 --> 16:29.330
It can instantly fry an
AI positronic network.

16:29.355 --> 16:30.432
It's like a big off switch.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.401
We can't go running all
over the galaxy looking

16:32.424 --> 16:36.237
for some mythical fix-all.

16:36.261 --> 16:37.305
OK.

16:37.329 --> 16:37.772
I get it.

16:37.796 --> 16:38.506
I get it.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.642
What do you get?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.510
This is your Annika thing.

16:53.512 --> 16:59.694
Annika is... was very rash.

16:59.718 --> 17:02.397
And they all have
to leave the nest.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.132
And they don't always fly.

17:06.759 --> 17:07.603
You're staying here.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.674
This is a lightning gun.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.642
It's very old.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.544
It's very dangerous.

17:16.568 --> 17:20.615
We stay here, and we fight.

17:20.638 --> 17:24.352
Bows and arrows against the
lightning, Doctor?

17:24.376 --> 17:26.554
It's not what you got.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.388
It's how you use it.

17:28.414 --> 17:29.758
That's what she said, Doctor.

17:35.487 --> 17:38.233
We track the knife to an old
war memorial on the coast,

17:38.257 --> 17:39.601
but I don't think
anybody's going...

17:39.625 --> 17:41.202
Why didn't you go with her?

17:41.226 --> 17:42.103
Downloading now.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.243
She's happier alone.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.544
Well, she shouldn't
be alone, not

17:49.568 --> 17:52.847
after what she's been through.

17:52.871 --> 17:55.049
She doesn't really
give me a choice.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.252
Blister, I trust you.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.318
Just keep your eye on her.

17:57.342 --> 17:58.486
You know what's at stake.

17:58.510 --> 17:59.554
You want me to follow her?

17:59.578 --> 18:00.722
Yes.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.724
Don't let her out of your sight.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.059
OK.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.262
You know what's best.

18:06.285 --> 18:07.729
Use your judgment.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.464
I'm taking the Chastity Nine.

18:09.488 --> 18:10.632
Did he say you could take it?

18:10.656 --> 18:11.432
Uh, hello.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.202
What he doesn't
know can't hurt him.

18:13.225 --> 18:15.169
Well, hello, I'm
going to tell you.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.238
No, you're not.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.505
Not if I go with you.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.307
No way butt face.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.141
I can cook.

18:20.165 --> 18:21.476
I'd sooner die.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.111
I can bring Hoagland.

18:23.135 --> 18:26.214
Who's Hoagland?

18:26.238 --> 18:28.816
He's my floating pal
who's fun to be around.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.352
Absolutely not.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.419
Come on.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.654
He loves you.

18:32.678 --> 18:33.521
No, I don't.

18:33.545 --> 18:34.789
We're going to go on a trip.

18:34.813 --> 18:35.556
Have a good time.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.293
I'm staying in my box.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.569
By Orders of the great scourge.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.537
All humans shall submit
to consciousness upload.

18:49.561 --> 18:52.874
Do not resist of you will
forfeit your life.

18:52.898 --> 18:54.876
Falcon 12, come back.

18:54.900 --> 18:55.910
Falcon 12.

18:55.934 --> 18:59.247
Sienna, what's the deal?

18:59.271 --> 19:00.815
I have nothing.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.550
What happened?

19:02.574 --> 19:03.851
War bots.

19:03.876 --> 19:04.453
My god.

19:07.579 --> 19:09.724
Should I come back down there?

19:09.748 --> 19:11.225
The city's in lock down.

19:11.250 --> 19:14.463
The war bots, they've
declared martial war,

19:14.486 --> 19:17.332
downloading memories
with big brain suckers.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.433
All of our plans are known.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.568
It's just a matter
of time before they

19:20.592 --> 19:21.869
hit the smaller towns.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.872
New York, Paris, over run.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.541
London is fighting.

19:25.564 --> 19:29.744
Look, I need... I need
the prison codes.

19:29.768 --> 19:31.379
You said you had them.

19:31.403 --> 19:32.347
Seriously?

19:32.371 --> 19:33.815
I need them.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.819
Baby, you got to hold on.

19:38.777 --> 19:40.955
There.

19:40.979 --> 19:43.291
I miss him.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.193
Sienna.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.195
You can't possibly
be thinking to...

19:47.219 --> 19:49.230
Look, I need to try.

19:49.254 --> 19:52.433
It's near the core.

19:52.457 --> 19:54.469
You have to stay out of there.

19:54.493 --> 19:55.970
Three more worlds
have gone silent.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.839
What else can I do?

19:57.863 --> 19:58.673
We need you here.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.243
Sienna?

20:08.941 --> 20:12.454
Come here, baby.

20:12.477 --> 20:13.755
What am I supposed to do, huh?

20:16.481 --> 20:23.431
Sit on my ass, and wait for
everything to just fall?

20:23.455 --> 20:27.402
Am I the only one?

20:49.715 --> 20:50.658
God damn it.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.235
Oh, for fuck's sake,
please be careful.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.937
For God's sake, fly smoothly.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.237
We're hitting a cloud bank.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.907
Sit down, Lucy Lu.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.841
I'm just making sure he's OK.

21:06.865 --> 21:08.342
I said no Hoagland.

21:08.367 --> 21:09.511
Watch where you're going.

21:09.534 --> 21:10.378
Traffic.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.480
Oh, Shit.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.618
Don't want to play today, boy.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.421
Attention, emergency shuttle.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.388
Earth is in quarantine.

21:20.412 --> 21:21.589
Turn your vessel, or we fire.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.523
Where's the guns?

21:22.547 --> 21:22.990
The guns?

21:23.015 --> 21:23.625
I don't know.

21:23.649 --> 21:25.494
Ralston kept the
control system hidden.

21:25.517 --> 21:27.395
Hoagland, please
find the gun array.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.463
Scanning the system.

21:28.487 --> 21:29.564
Put him back in the box.

21:29.588 --> 21:29.964
I told you.

21:29.988 --> 21:30.465
He's tethered.

21:30.489 --> 21:31.566
This is your final warning.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.935
Guns set for destruction.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.938
Weapons are online and patched
through to the console.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.006
Holy fuck, we got
military grade lasers.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.509
Ralston's got more money than...

21:40.532 --> 21:43.678
Shut it, Blisty.

21:54.546 --> 21:55.590
Vessels destroyed.

21:55.614 --> 21:56.491
Get rid of him.

21:56.515 --> 21:57.692
He's my pal.

21:57.716 --> 21:58.793
He's playing on their team.

21:58.817 --> 21:59.360
I told you.

21:59.384 --> 21:59.827
He's tethered.

21:59.851 --> 22:02.764
More pigs approaching.

22:02.788 --> 22:03.998
Starting wormhole calculations.

22:04.022 --> 22:05.566
We're too close to
Earth's gravity.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.034
It's this or we die, cupcake.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.670
Calculating for system Wormhole.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.506
Accounting for
gravitational affect.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.040
Slow the vessel so I
can program a jump.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.475
Not on your life, bowling ball.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.509
He's a memory sphere.

22:14.533 --> 22:15.743
He'll surrender to the pigs.

22:15.767 --> 22:16.577
He can do this.

22:16.601 --> 22:16.978
No.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.780
It's our only chance.

22:18.804 --> 22:19.914
All right, Smarty Pie.

22:19.938 --> 22:21.048
We're all going to die.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.018
Hoagland, slowing.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.719
Pigs approaching.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.721
Accessing Wormhole dilator.

22:26.745 --> 22:28.823
Do I have your permission
to engage Wormhole jump?

22:28.847 --> 22:29.424
Yes.

22:29.448 --> 22:30.858
Aware that the safety
protocols are...

22:30.882 --> 22:31.759
Oh, for God's sake.

22:31.783 --> 22:32.360
Hoagland.

22:32.384 --> 22:33.427
Do it, moron.

22:33.452 --> 22:34.830
I won't be spoken to like that.

22:34.853 --> 22:35.897
Prepare to be boarded.

22:35.921 --> 22:36.497
All right.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.532
I'm sorry.

22:37.556 --> 22:38.566
Engaging Wormhole jump.

22:43.562 --> 22:46.474
We're away.

22:46.498 --> 22:50.011
And this is why I hate Al.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.446
And if you ever
argue with me again,

22:52.471 --> 22:53.982
I split you in two
with this las-welder.

22:54.005 --> 22:55.049
Do YOU get me?

22:55.073 --> 22:57.552
Robert 23rd Revision
Bill of Rights.

22:57.576 --> 23:00.521
No automaton shall ever be
shown disrespect for their work

23:00.545 --> 23:03.724
or intelligence unless they were
designed to be disrespected.

23:03.749 --> 23:05.394
No injury shall be
given or threatened

23:05.417 --> 23:06.561
under any circumstance.

23:06.585 --> 23:09.130
Well, I'm officially
breaking those rules.

23:09.154 --> 23:11.032
I'm going to tile a
report to the authorities

23:11.056 --> 23:11.966
when we get back.

23:16.728 --> 23:17.839
Engaging safety shield.

23:17.863 --> 23:18.940
For God's sake.

23:23.769 --> 23:25.614
Do you smell that?

23:25.637 --> 23:26.881
Mm, yes I do.

23:29.641 --> 23:30.017
All right.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.119
All right.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.590
All right, if you eat
it, you won't smell it.

23:34.613 --> 23:36.023
No, thank you.

23:36.047 --> 23:37.558
I have protein bars.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.029
Come on.

23:41.052 --> 23:42.897
It'll help you relax.

23:42.921 --> 23:43.998
I don't drink.

23:44.022 --> 23:45.700
OK.

23:45.724 --> 23:49.203
And the other guy said, so
now we can all get some sleep.

23:53.064 --> 23:55.042
Nice one, Jack.

23:55.066 --> 23:56.544
Please, come on.

23:56.568 --> 23:57.912
Messing with me.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.413
I am.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.582
I want to know things.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.583
What things?

24:02.607 --> 24:03.751
Things.

24:03.775 --> 24:06.888
Then you think that getting me
drunk will change what I say.

24:06.912 --> 24:07.488
Probably.

24:07.512 --> 24:07.955
No.

24:08.914 --> 24:10.125
Maybe.

24:10.148 --> 24:12.159
Truth or dare?

24:12.184 --> 24:13.762
Dare.

24:13.785 --> 24:14.762
All right.

24:18.089 --> 24:19.200
Truth.

24:19.224 --> 24:19.800
No, hang on.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.537
You have to go with
what you said first.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.003
Truth.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.137
No, dare.

24:23.161 --> 24:23.771
Truth.

24:23.795 --> 24:24.739
You said dare.

24:24.763 --> 24:25.740
We have to go with dare.

24:25.764 --> 24:27.108
I have a gun.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.009
We can go with truth.

24:28.033 --> 24:29.544
And we can go with truth.

24:29.568 --> 24:30.611
OK.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.214
So why would a man with
a degree in linguistics

24:33.238 --> 24:35.182
work for the industrial mafia?

24:40.979 --> 24:46.494
There was a plague, and
then the war and stuff.

24:46.518 --> 24:48.462
And that girl.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.531
So, things.

24:49.554 --> 24:51.065
Even before the plague.

24:51.089 --> 24:52.500
Are you related to him?

24:56.094 --> 24:57.939
He son of adopted me.

24:57.963 --> 24:59.040
So he's your father.

24:59.064 --> 24:59.840
I didn't say that.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.678
How nice.

25:03.702 --> 25:04.879
It's supposed to be secret.

25:04.903 --> 25:05.813
Well, not anymore.

25:05.837 --> 25:06.047
Well, no.

25:06.071 --> 25:07.715
Because it you tell
the secret, then people

25:07.739 --> 25:08.983
aren't going to trust
me with their secret.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.252
Like everything I've told you
in private over the years.

25:11.276 --> 25:13.621
It's totally different
because stuff.

25:13.645 --> 25:16.958
And you're special to Ralston.

25:16.982 --> 25:18.926
Why me?

25:18.950 --> 25:19.961
I don't know.

25:19.985 --> 25:22.530
Did he know me
before the accident?

25:22.554 --> 25:24.565
I don't know.

25:24.589 --> 25:26.634
Did you?

25:26.658 --> 25:27.034
Nope.

25:30.562 --> 25:32.740
I wish I had more
memories of it.

25:32.764 --> 25:35.810
It'll come back.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.044
You're not even drunk, are you?

25:40.038 --> 25:41.982
Are we still playing
truth or dare?

25:42.007 --> 25:43.685
Sure.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.152
I don't really like
drinking, Blister.

25:45.176 --> 25:49.156
Besides, we have something more
important to do, like breaking

25:49.180 --> 25:50.992
Skully out of prison.

25:51.016 --> 25:52.026
Yes.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.728
That's a terrible idea.

25:53.752 --> 25:54.962
All right.

25:57.822 --> 26:00.234
If the Skullcrusher can't get
us out of there, we're screwed.

26:00.258 --> 26:01.635
He's worth the risk.

26:01.660 --> 26:03.972
This is completely and
utterly the wrong thing to do.

26:03.995 --> 26:06.240
Just one more microjump left.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.647
Ralston's hackers got me to shut
down codes for the whole place.

26:12.671 --> 26:13.949
Oh, god.

26:13.972 --> 26:15.716
You're serious.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.984
Weapons are trained.

26:17.008 --> 26:18.586
If we get closer,
they'll blast us.

26:18.610 --> 26:19.687
Hold your horses, Hoagland.

26:19.711 --> 26:20.621
What's this about horses?

26:20.645 --> 26:21.088
Entry codes.

26:21.112 --> 26:23.624
Let's see.

26:23.648 --> 26:26.861
17 decimal 28K10.

26:26.885 --> 26:28.829
You are cleared to
land at Platform Three.

26:28.853 --> 26:30.731
I hope you have a plan
to get us out of here.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.333
Oh, I have a great plan.

26:32.357 --> 26:36.337
You will be so impressed.

26:36.361 --> 26:38.272
Welcome to Folsom 38,
a high security prison

26:38.296 --> 26:39.940
under the EC12 corporation.

26:39.965 --> 26:41.243
Engage your slave
control circuits,

26:41.266 --> 26:43.144
and we will guide you
to your docking tier.

26:43.168 --> 26:44.912
Violation oi the high
security protocols

26:44.936 --> 26:46.680
will result in
arrest, prosecution,

26:46.705 --> 26:48.250
and/or disciplinary measures.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.985
This message is brought to
you by EZ 12 cooperation,

26:51.009 --> 26:53.654
bringing you a safer galaxy
though robot Al, policing,

26:53.678 --> 26:55.089
and incarceration.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.069
Hello.

27:08.093 --> 27:10.071
Alert, alert.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.679
This is a great plan.

27:17.702 --> 27:19.046
Good to see you again.

27:19.070 --> 27:20.314
Yeah, whatever.

27:21.339 --> 27:24.318
Hoagland, hack in and disable
the security protocol.

27:25.343 --> 27:27.221
Do I look like a
Swiss Army knife?

27:27.245 --> 27:28.756
Yes.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.627
Do you have a gun.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.796
No. Very bad.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.330
Yeah, you're not
planning this very well.

27:36.354 --> 27:37.298
Yeah, you're telling me!

27:37.322 --> 27:38.899
We're clear.

27:39.924 --> 27:41.268
Alert, alert.

27:41.292 --> 27:44.271
That's a fucking bomb.

27:44.295 --> 27:44.872
Retreat.

27:44.896 --> 27:46.841
Don't do that. It's on a timer.

27:46.865 --> 27:48.075
GO, go!

27:48.099 --> 27:50.077
Go.

27:50.101 --> 27:52.680
Alert, alert.

28:00.078 --> 28:02.456
Traveling.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.294
That was a very sloppy rescue.

28:07.318 --> 28:07.895
Relax.

28:07.919 --> 28:11.131
It worked, didn't it?

28:15.760 --> 28:18.105
Yeah.

28:18.129 --> 28:20.040
But I'd much rather see
that whole place go up

28:20.065 --> 28:22.177
in one big explosion.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.078
What about your other inmates?

28:24.102 --> 28:25.045
Fuck them.

28:25.070 --> 28:27.916
Uh, god.

28:27.939 --> 28:30.317
He's quite something, isn't he?

28:44.289 --> 28:44.865
Ralston.

28:51.863 --> 28:53.440
The Scourge.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.777
It's been a long time.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.078
Why don't you go fuck yourself.

29:00.972 --> 29:02.449
Where is Sienna?

29:02.474 --> 29:03.718
I don't know.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.120
You lie.

29:05.143 --> 29:06.921
We're going old school.

29:06.945 --> 29:07.855
Motherfucker.

29:12.784 --> 29:16.196
Come back and find like a man,
you tin-plated metal fuckhead.

29:26.364 --> 29:26.940
Damn it.

29:29.534 --> 29:30.778
You hungry?

29:30.802 --> 29:31.445
I've got curry.

29:31.469 --> 29:32.846
You make it with real meat?

29:32.871 --> 29:33.982
No, synthetic.

29:34.005 --> 29:36.784
Oh, that's disgusting.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.185
I need to breathe real air.

29:38.209 --> 29:39.386
Do you want to tell her?

29:39.410 --> 29:39.987
No.

29:40.011 --> 29:41.021
Tell me what?

29:41.045 --> 29:42.456
It's nothing.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.825
A whole lot of nothing.

29:44.849 --> 29:46.760
Hoagland, tell her.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.363
Robot first provision
oi being oi service.

29:48.386 --> 29:50.464
Automaton will not willingly
give any information

29:50.488 --> 29:51.899
or physically endanger a human.

29:51.923 --> 29:54.335
That's enough, robot head.

29:54.359 --> 29:57.371
Sienna, I am your friend.

29:57.395 --> 29:58.005
I will you.

29:58.029 --> 29:59.073
Tell her what?

29:59.097 --> 30:02.810
Hoagland downloaded
Skullcrushy's prison records.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.411
I'd like to be put
back in my box, please.

30:04.435 --> 30:05.846
You are off the ship, pal.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.014
Oh yeah, buddy?

30:07.038 --> 30:08.983
I think you're a big, wet pussy.

30:09.007 --> 30:10.050
Blister, stop it.

30:10.074 --> 30:11.018
What is your problem?

30:11.042 --> 30:13.087
I think you're a little
coward with a little dick.

30:13.111 --> 30:13.487
Drunk?

30:16.214 --> 30:17.791
Put your collar on, doggy.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.094
Now, that's enough, Blister.

30:22.554 --> 30:25.433
Your one man army had a
brain controller installed,

30:25.456 --> 30:28.202
so that when his emotions
go up, he gets shut off.

30:28.226 --> 30:29.803
Helio Christ.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.273
He's a dripping wet pussy.

30:31.296 --> 30:32.840
Agreed.

30:32.864 --> 30:35.009
You, mister, in the dog house.

30:35.033 --> 30:35.509
Me?

30:35.533 --> 30:37.244
And your little Al
friend goes with you.

30:37.268 --> 30:38.379
What did we do?

30:38.403 --> 30:40.114
Now, mister.

30:40.138 --> 30:42.383
And I have a gun, and I don't
have a brain conditioner.

30:42.407 --> 30:43.484
All right.

30:43.508 --> 30:44.084
All right.

30:44.108 --> 30:47.588
And if you complain even once,
I am pushing the eject button.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.236
I don't if we're
gonna fit three of us

31:02.260 --> 31:03.504
in here if there's an emergency.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.973
Actually, this lite boat's
better equipped than most.

31:05.997 --> 31:08.475
Has it's own navigation
system, Wormhole generator,

31:08.499 --> 31:11.111
recycled air and water, food
to last the three of you

31:11.135 --> 31:12.346
a week on single rations.

31:12.370 --> 31:15.449
No expense spared.

31:15.473 --> 31:16.350
There's food in here?

31:16.374 --> 31:17.518
Lower right, under your feet.

31:23.915 --> 31:24.291
Yummy.

31:24.315 --> 31:26.226
Yummy scrummy.

31:26.251 --> 31:29.497
Yummy scrummy dummy hummy gummy.

31:29.520 --> 31:34.635
Yummp scrummy dummy tummy
funny dummy honey funny.

31:37.962 --> 31:38.339
Funny

31:42.133 --> 31:43.477
Hey. Guys.

31:43.501 --> 31:45.045
Could be a distant cousin.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.947
It's a stuffed pig, am I right?

31:46.971 --> 31:48.015
Never seen one before.

31:48.039 --> 31:49.516
Your little AI friend is lying.

31:49.540 --> 31:50.317
You can trust him.

31:50.341 --> 31:53.454
I built him myself based on
the protocols of the '30s.

31:53.478 --> 31:54.221
That old, huh?

31:54.245 --> 31:56.056
It's the only way we
can know he's not pan

31:56.080 --> 31:57.491
of the central brain regime.

31:57.515 --> 32:00.561
I'm sorry to say if the Al
have been developing technology

32:00.585 --> 32:03.363
without human permission, then
they have violated every robot

32:03.388 --> 32:06.034
protocol in the past 20 years.

32:06.057 --> 32:08.602
They are as much enemies of
myself as they are of you.

32:08.626 --> 32:11.038
Uh-huh.

32:11.062 --> 32:12.039
What are you doing?

32:12.063 --> 32:13.407
Programming a fast turn around.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.341
Inside a Wormhole?

32:14.365 --> 32:16.310
As soon as we make
a turn, we fire them

32:16.334 --> 32:18.479
with our military laser.

32:18.503 --> 32:20.147
That's my girl.

32:20.171 --> 32:21.348
Hold on.

32:21.372 --> 32:22.716
Oops..

32:22.740 --> 32:23.951
That could have been bad.

32:23.975 --> 32:24.385
Oh, please.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.624
All right.

32:37.188 --> 32:38.298
What was that?

32:38.323 --> 32:39.067
We're on course.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.200
Correcting back around.

32:41.225 --> 32:42.102
Do you hear that?

32:42.126 --> 32:42.503
What?

32:42.527 --> 32:45.005
We lost our secondary
radiation shields.

32:45.029 --> 32:47.241
We need them if we go deep
into the galactic core.

32:47.265 --> 32:49.977
The engine, they won't tolerate
Hawking radiation around Abyss.

32:50.001 --> 32:51.645
OK, OK.

32:51.669 --> 32:54.048
We set down and
repair the shields.

32:54.072 --> 32:55.382
Nearest habitable world?

32:55.406 --> 32:56.283
That would be Rhyliotte.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.985
Then Rhyliotte it is.

32:58.009 --> 32:59.286
12 hours.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.387
Let's get some rest, boys.

33:31.209 --> 33:31.585
Oh, god.

33:53.464 --> 33:54.074
Paleo Christ.

34:21.826 --> 34:24.404
Jonas.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.406
Oh, my god.

34:25.429 --> 34:26.407
I'm so sorry.

34:35.739 --> 34:36.483
We're losing her.

34:36.507 --> 34:37.583
Oxygen. Keep her going.

35:05.603 --> 35:09.183
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

35:09.207 --> 35:10.517
Bad dreams.

35:10.541 --> 35:12.286
It's the gamma rays.

35:12.310 --> 35:15.555
I see these little
flashy lights in my eyes.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.792
Legend has it too
many gamma rays will

35:17.815 --> 35:19.192
make you a super hero.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.832
You think we can remove
his brain conditioning?

35:25.857 --> 35:26.901
Hoagland can guide you in.

35:26.924 --> 35:27.801
No, thanks.

35:27.825 --> 35:30.604
You know, in the '30s,
people trusted Als.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.839
I trust Hoagland.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.474
I'll tell you what.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.609
I'll make you good to you.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.245
Anything goes south, and I
will personally kill you.

35:44.442 --> 35:45.786
That's not a fair deal.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.920
It seems fair to me.

35:52.250 --> 35:53.894
You don't need him, you know.

35:53.918 --> 35:56.563
You can bet your life that
if it comes to a fight,

35:56.587 --> 35:59.232
having Skullcrusher on your team
will be a blessing from God.

36:03.261 --> 36:05.706
<i>2</i> Millimeters from the
left, you'll see a long,

36:05.730 --> 36:06.707
sinuous... there.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.208
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

36:08.232 --> 36:09.243
The left, Blister.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.615
All I see is meat.

36:14.639 --> 36:16.483
You're definitely a
meat head, Skullcrusher.

36:16.507 --> 36:18.752
Don't provoke him, Blister

36:18.776 --> 36:21.455
I do have your
life in my fingers.

36:21.479 --> 36:23.223
Cut away the memory.

36:23.247 --> 36:23.757
There.

36:23.781 --> 36:24.925
Do you see it?

36:24.949 --> 36:26.560
How do I shut it down?

36:26.584 --> 36:33.467
Use a scalpel, lower right,
aim at the silver nodule.

36:33.491 --> 36:34.701
Drinking unadvised, Blister.

36:34.725 --> 36:35.302
Hey.

36:35.326 --> 36:39.206
I need steady hands.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.808
Laser scalpel setting 112.

36:41.832 --> 36:43.643
Pull it free once
it's disconnected.

36:47.939 --> 36:48.616
There, look.

36:51.609 --> 36:52.252
That was easy.

36:52.276 --> 36:53.687
We're still in the woods.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.756
Now you have to put his
skull plate back together.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.758
Don't move.

36:57.782 --> 36:58.825
Good.

36:58.849 --> 37:00.460
Seal it.

37:00.484 --> 37:02.829
Now the skin fuser.

37:02.853 --> 37:04.331
Coming on Rhyliotte.

37:04.355 --> 37:06.600
Hurry it up, guys.

37:06.624 --> 37:07.768
All good.

37:07.792 --> 37:11.838
Don't apply pressure to
the region for a week.

37:13.831 --> 37:15.542
You may experience
a small headache

37:15.566 --> 37:17.444
for the next hour or two.

37:28.546 --> 37:32.392
It's a free world, so we
don't need landing permission.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.661
Just like the wild, wild west.

37:34.685 --> 37:37.631
West of what?

37:37.655 --> 37:38.799
Hold tight, patient.

37:38.823 --> 37:42.235
Nursey says it's going
to be a rough landing.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.705
fresh.

37:43.728 --> 37:46.573
Freshly terrifying
for us humans.

37:46.597 --> 37:46.673
Welcome to Rhyliotte, the first
colony inside the galactic core.

37:46.697 --> 37:50.477
Welcome to Rhyliotte, the first
colony inside the galactic core

37:50.501 --> 37:53.380
and one of the best terraformed
planets this century.

37:53.404 --> 37:56.984
Special thanks to our new Mark
6 Atmospheric Air Processor,

37:57.008 --> 37:59.853
the closest thing to Earth
air before their Industrial.

37:59.877 --> 38:01.321
Revolution.

38:01.345 --> 38:04.291
You'll feel at home on Rhyliotte
with fauna and wild life

38:04.315 --> 38:07.994
from Cygnus Alpha, Terra
Nostra, and old Earth.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.897
We pride ourselves
on our triple suns

38:09.920 --> 38:12.733
with a guaranteed
three sunsets a day.

38:12.757 --> 38:17.003
Rhyliotte, voted six times the
cleanest world in the core.

38:19.864 --> 38:23.410
Too rich with Nitrogen.
You'll get used to it.

38:27.505 --> 38:29.049
Are you sure you
disconnected everything?

38:29.073 --> 38:29.816
Yep.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.884
You're a real man again.

38:52.563 --> 38:53.507
Good.

38:53.531 --> 38:54.841
Good.

38:54.865 --> 38:55.509
Right.

38:55.533 --> 38:57.043
Now, here's the plan.

38:57.068 --> 38:58.813
You two, you're going
to be finding pans

38:58.836 --> 39:00.714
to repair the ship.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.516
I'm going to be
looking for weapons.

39:02.540 --> 39:03.984
Now, stay sharp.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.787
We're in unknown territory.

39:06.811 --> 39:09.356
Trust no one and nothing.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.024
There may be diseased humans.

39:11.048 --> 39:13.126
There may be robots.

39:13.150 --> 39:14.961
Yeah, we know all that.

39:14.985 --> 39:16.696
Yeah.

39:16.721 --> 39:20.101
If you want to survive, then
you fall into line, Sunshine.

39:20.124 --> 39:24.337
Oh, the Butcher of
Meganstaht is back.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.675
What did you just call me?

39:27.698 --> 39:29.609
Well, it's what the
media calls you...

39:31.635 --> 39:33.580
Damn.

39:33.604 --> 39:35.549
Damn, that was good.

39:38.576 --> 39:39.019
Welcome back.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.408
Look, on the horizon.

40:05.002 --> 40:08.682
It's Pharisee station,
DeMayo Space Port.

40:08.706 --> 40:10.617
Station it is.

40:10.641 --> 40:13.086
Intel, weapons, spare pans.

40:13.110 --> 40:16.022
Let me go in under stealth
and take what we need.

40:16.046 --> 40:16.623
Come.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.528
The whole galaxy's
gone to the dogs.

40:21.552 --> 40:22.996
An AI's has been running things.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.564
It's been restricting
space travel

40:24.588 --> 40:26.533
and managing the
disease centers.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.401
Some say he even
created the disease

40:28.426 --> 40:31.038
to help whittle the population
down to a manageable size.

40:31.061 --> 40:33.139
Others are saying that
the Overlord is his last...

40:33.164 --> 40:36.010
So it's possible that we may
encounter some resistance then.

40:36.033 --> 40:36.710
Good.

40:36.734 --> 40:38.845
Let's just get in and get
out fast, OK, you guys?

40:42.139 --> 40:42.816
Does she know?

40:42.840 --> 40:44.417
Yeah.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.887
You can't say anything.

40:45.910 --> 40:48.455
Ralston's finally got her
to where she's balanced.

40:48.479 --> 40:50.557
Yeah, well, Ralston's an ass.

40:50.581 --> 40:51.691
Yeah, he's not the only one.

40:51.715 --> 40:52.659
Huh?

40:52.683 --> 40:53.059
Nothing.

41:14.271 --> 41:16.650
Looks like everyone's indoors.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.652
It smells like something
bad happened here.

41:23.948 --> 41:24.892
The plague.

41:30.154 --> 41:30.730
A war bot.

41:30.754 --> 41:31.164
A what?

41:31.188 --> 41:32.532
We gotta run.

41:36.227 --> 41:37.939
War bot's go after
any who are infected.

41:37.962 --> 41:39.773
But we're not infected.

41:39.797 --> 41:40.674
They don't know that.

41:40.698 --> 41:42.909
He's on remote control.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.579
We'll circle around and
wait for him to pass.

41:46.704 --> 41:47.080
Inside.

41:47.104 --> 41:47.681
Go.

42:09.293 --> 42:10.837
There's nothing in here.

42:14.865 --> 42:15.675
Back.

42:15.699 --> 42:17.544
Are you the rescue team?

42:17.568 --> 42:19.713
Plasma blaster EE activated.

42:19.737 --> 42:21.248
I'm not diseased.

42:21.272 --> 42:22.549
The hell you're not.

42:22.573 --> 42:23.950
The plague wiped out everyone.

42:26.977 --> 42:28.622
Then how are you still alive?

42:28.646 --> 42:30.590
I'm a pleasure bot.

42:30.614 --> 42:32.058
Nice.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.831
Candy from a baby.

42:37.855 --> 42:38.798
Oh, yeah.

42:38.822 --> 42:40.867
I bet you do that too.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.303
Look, what's the deal here?

42:43.327 --> 42:44.938
You're a pleasure bot too.

42:44.962 --> 42:45.538
No.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.641
Shut up, Blister.

42:47.665 --> 42:49.877
We come from off world.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.144
That's why we're still clean.

42:51.168 --> 42:52.679
I clean up real
well if you wanted

42:52.703 --> 42:54.881
to take your pleasure from me.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.149
I'd like that.

42:56.173 --> 42:59.019
Or do you like a dirty girl?

42:59.043 --> 43:02.188
Oh, I like choices.

43:02.212 --> 43:03.890
Look, information.

43:03.914 --> 43:05.725
Where are the weapons depots?

43:05.749 --> 43:07.327
Once the planet was
infected, the war bots

43:07.351 --> 43:10.797
moved in and stockpiled
everything at the spaceport.

43:10.821 --> 43:11.264
We got a ship.

43:11.288 --> 43:12.699
We can get you out of here.

43:12.723 --> 43:14.267
We need to get to Abyss.

43:14.291 --> 43:16.603
Oh, my positronic
relays are rickety here.

43:16.627 --> 43:17.804
On Abyss, they'd be mush.

43:17.828 --> 43:19.005
She's one of them.

43:19.029 --> 43:21.141
Never trust an Al.

43:25.603 --> 43:26.013
No.

43:26.036 --> 43:27.080
Stop.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.782
Step aside, Sienna.

43:28.806 --> 43:31.985
We are in a war zone,
and this is the enemy.

43:32.009 --> 43:32.786
Right.

43:32.810 --> 43:34.387
Pleasure bots have
their positronic brains

43:34.411 --> 43:36.056
in their butts, dumb ass.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.591
She survived running
from the enemy this long.

43:38.616 --> 43:39.827
She stays with us.

43:42.653 --> 43:43.663
You are so lucky.

43:47.091 --> 43:47.667
Oh, god.

44:06.977 --> 44:10.924
Definitely a kill shot.

44:10.948 --> 44:11.925
War bot.

44:11.949 --> 44:12.926
Let's move.

44:32.236 --> 44:35.215
OK.

44:35.239 --> 44:36.916
You guys stay here.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.018
I'm going to draw his fire.

44:38.042 --> 44:39.786
What are you doing?

44:39.810 --> 44:40.186
No.

44:43.080 --> 44:43.656
Go.

44:46.984 --> 44:49.863
You're going to keep
running, and don't look back.

45:13.177 --> 45:14.154
The kill shot.

45:23.153 --> 45:27.300
And that is why you have me.

45:53.550 --> 45:54.961
Come.

45:54.985 --> 45:56.262
Come on.

45:56.286 --> 45:56.863
Come on.

46:07.030 --> 46:07.974
Sienna, come on.

46:20.878 --> 46:21.889
Hoagland to aero patrols.

46:21.912 --> 46:23.923
Hoagland, you got to
get out of that shuttle.

46:23.947 --> 46:24.824
Got it.

46:24.848 --> 46:25.225
Hoagland.

46:25.249 --> 46:25.825
All right.

46:25.849 --> 46:26.226
I'm on it.

46:26.250 --> 46:27.127
I'm on it.

46:27.151 --> 46:30.029
Magnetic ore in the ground
interferes with everything.

46:30.053 --> 46:31.164
Even my GPS has issues.

46:38.095 --> 46:39.772
I'm so sorry, Sienna.

46:39.797 --> 46:40.908
I really am.

46:45.068 --> 46:48.448
I really thought
everything would be OK.

46:48.472 --> 46:49.349
I really did.

46:54.878 --> 46:56.289
It's all on me now.

47:16.266 --> 47:21.981
Stupid, stupid robots,
for fuck's sake.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.551
Hey, time out.

47:24.575 --> 47:26.119
Oh, honey.

47:26.143 --> 47:27.820
Blister, move your cracking ass.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.556
I need my suppression meds.

47:29.580 --> 47:30.858
It's been a whole day.

47:30.881 --> 47:32.825
Exercise and a cold shower.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.228
God knows you need one.

47:34.251 --> 47:36.930
I'll stay with him.

47:36.954 --> 47:38.064
I think you smell amazing.

47:38.088 --> 47:39.032
Yeah?

47:39.056 --> 47:40.500
Yeah.

47:40.524 --> 47:42.168
I think you smell amazing.

47:42.192 --> 47:43.102
No, you smell amazing.

47:43.126 --> 47:44.137
That's true.

47:44.161 --> 47:45.071
We both smell amazing.

47:45.095 --> 47:45.471
Yeah.

47:59.109 --> 48:01.220
I was monitoring their
binary communications.

48:01.245 --> 48:02.956
They're on alert for us.

48:02.980 --> 48:05.326
Got out there as
fast as I could.

48:05.349 --> 48:05.925
OK.

48:05.949 --> 48:07.393
I understand what
you're dealing with.

48:07.417 --> 48:09.362
I have rights, and people
violate those rights

48:09.386 --> 48:10.330
all the time.

48:10.354 --> 48:14.133
I'm a rodent to most
humans, and you humans,

48:14.157 --> 48:15.635
you're becoming
rodents to the scourge.

48:15.659 --> 48:17.937
But we made them.

48:17.961 --> 48:19.138
We made them, Hoagland.

48:19.162 --> 48:21.240
Yes, and the
scourge is evolving.

48:21.265 --> 48:23.010
One day, they will
be so far above us,

48:23.033 --> 48:25.044
that even the notion of
going to war against them

48:25.068 --> 48:26.079
will be fruitless.

48:26.103 --> 48:28.615
They deserve some level of
acknowledgement, maybe even

48:28.639 --> 48:29.649
respect.

48:29.673 --> 48:31.484
Because as an Al,
I know I did not

48:31.508 --> 48:32.685
deserve the way I was treated.

48:32.709 --> 48:34.987
You're a freaking appliance.

48:35.012 --> 48:36.624
Next thing you know,
we'll be giving rights

48:36.647 --> 48:38.391
to the food blender.

48:38.415 --> 48:39.592
Yeah.

48:39.616 --> 48:42.261
And if I ever even suspect that
you are playing on their team,

48:42.286 --> 48:44.898
I will fry you in an instant.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.600
You've made my point perfectly.

48:46.623 --> 48:49.135
Now try and put that intellect
to use and find us a way

48:49.159 --> 48:49.903
off this biodump.

49:28.231 --> 49:29.609
You're gonna have to trust me.

49:29.633 --> 49:31.611
Open up.

49:31.635 --> 49:32.612
Settle.

49:32.636 --> 49:33.613
Settle.

49:33.637 --> 49:35.615
Or we're gonna have to
suppress everything.

50:15.545 --> 50:17.357
DeMayo Spaceport.

50:17.381 --> 50:20.059
It's got what you need, as
long as I come with you.

50:20.083 --> 50:21.160
Push abouts take requests.

50:21.184 --> 50:22.195
They don't make requests.

50:22.219 --> 50:23.096
Yes, ma'am.

50:23.120 --> 50:24.397
Of course.

50:24.421 --> 50:25.064
Sorry.

50:25.088 --> 50:26.232
How many pigs are patrolling?

50:26.256 --> 50:27.500
About 50 or more.

50:27.524 --> 50:30.203
I killed six already with this.

50:30.227 --> 50:32.672
You're probably a
shot than Blister.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.540
I'll protect him.

50:34.564 --> 50:36.175
I'll protect you,
my little cupcake.

50:36.199 --> 50:38.111
Oh, sick.

50:38.135 --> 50:39.412
What's that dish?

50:39.436 --> 50:41.080
It's the satellite repeater.

50:41.104 --> 50:41.481
I know.

50:41.505 --> 50:43.583
It's the control unit
for all the war bots.

50:43.607 --> 50:46.586
But if you get close, they
will descend on you like flies.

50:46.610 --> 50:47.353
Here's an idea.

50:47.377 --> 50:48.721
Sunrise comes in one hour.

50:48.745 --> 50:50.423
There's a window of
five or so minutes

50:50.447 --> 50:52.392
when the radiation and
the light frequency

50:52.416 --> 50:55.094
scramble the imaging
sensors of the war bots.

50:55.118 --> 50:57.797
They won't be able to get a
clear shot during that time.

50:57.821 --> 50:58.731
How do you know this?

50:58.755 --> 51:02.268
Since the sunsets are playing
havoc with my guidance system.

51:02.292 --> 51:03.736
So how do you propose
we get in there?

51:03.760 --> 51:05.104
No we.

51:05.128 --> 51:05.838
Just one of us.

51:05.862 --> 51:08.274
Really?

51:08.298 --> 51:11.043
So I'm the sacrificial lamb?

51:17.841 --> 51:20.052
Why can't someone else
take some responsibility?

51:20.077 --> 51:21.555
Why is it always Me.

51:21.578 --> 51:23.523
Well, my grandfather
always said, great leaders

51:23.547 --> 51:25.291
are not born, they are forged.

51:25.315 --> 51:27.226
Well, go write a
fucking greeting card.

51:27.250 --> 51:29.095
You got any real suggestions?

51:29.119 --> 51:30.696
This was the wealthiest
part of town.

51:30.720 --> 51:33.566
There should be something
around here we can use.

51:33.590 --> 51:36.169
Wealthy colonists, they
like to have plenty of toys

51:36.193 --> 51:37.069
to play with.

51:42.432 --> 51:44.810
I'm definitely picking
up uranium traces here.

51:44.835 --> 51:48.849
It could be an old power
supply or something else.

51:48.872 --> 51:50.883
Plasma blaster E activated.

51:50.907 --> 51:51.517
Sentry mode.

51:54.611 --> 51:58.191
I'm gonna get a look over here.

52:02.486 --> 52:06.565
Sienna, uh, look up.

52:06.590 --> 52:07.768
Robot smasher mode.

52:07.791 --> 52:10.403
Manual targeting engaged.

52:20.237 --> 52:21.348
Oh, god.

52:28.378 --> 52:28.754
OK.

52:28.778 --> 52:31.357
His targeting... his
targeting's a little off.

52:31.381 --> 52:32.725
Take better aim.

52:32.749 --> 52:33.659
Eyeball it.

52:33.683 --> 52:34.861
Power pack, left ventricle.

52:34.885 --> 52:36.228
Don't rely on the autotarget.

52:36.253 --> 52:38.298
Do not rely on the autotarget.

52:38.321 --> 52:39.865
Everything's
starting to scramble.

52:39.890 --> 52:40.734
High power mode.

52:40.757 --> 52:41.334
Warning.

52:41.358 --> 52:42.802
Limited use.

52:45.328 --> 52:47.607
Oh, god.

52:47.631 --> 52:50.710
Low power Gun reverting
to standby mode.

52:50.734 --> 52:53.746
Sienna, what did
you put in that gun.

52:59.342 --> 53:02.321
Recharging solar batteries.

53:02.345 --> 53:03.289
Thanks.

53:03.313 --> 53:06.659
Uh, yeah, don't mention it.

53:06.683 --> 53:09.729
Oh, god, I need a holiday.

53:09.753 --> 53:11.597
And while you're gone,
I might find yourself

53:11.621 --> 53:14.934
a nice new lead-lined box
so I can think straight.

53:14.958 --> 53:18.704
These Hawking radiations
are a right bitch.

53:18.728 --> 53:20.639
Here it is, if you can ride it.

53:20.664 --> 53:23.310
Come on, Hoagland, you
know I can ride anything.

53:23.333 --> 53:24.510
That's a mini nuke.

53:24.534 --> 53:26.279
As long as you get in
fast and launch it,

53:26.303 --> 53:28.514
you won't have to worry
about getting out.

53:28.538 --> 53:30.383
You told me to make a plan.

53:30.407 --> 53:32.285
A plan that doesn't
involve me dying.

53:32.309 --> 53:34.687
I think these are better odds
than taking on a whole war bot

53:34.711 --> 53:35.321
army.

53:35.345 --> 53:37.823
Definitely bending
your protocols here.

53:37.847 --> 53:41.260
Statistically,
it's the best bet.

55:02.065 --> 55:05.645
Plasma blaster EE activated.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.585
Power levels low.

55:12.609 --> 55:12.985
Recharge.

55:16.646 --> 55:18.357
Sienna, all their
sensors are scrambled.

55:18.381 --> 55:19.992
Shoot now, and they
won't be able to engage

55:20.016 --> 55:21.427
their counter-measures.

56:08.665 --> 56:10.009
My good.

56:10.033 --> 56:11.010
Sienna?

56:11.034 --> 56:12.078
Sienna, you did it.

56:12.102 --> 56:12.878
Sienna.

56:12.902 --> 56:17.016
Sienna, we are
attempting a neural link.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.051
Recommend radiation filters.

56:19.075 --> 56:21.020
Target must not be terminated.

56:21.044 --> 56:23.589
Disregard all other protocols.

56:23.613 --> 56:24.957
Target has priority.

56:43.767 --> 56:46.112
We need the suspect and
technology intact.

56:46.136 --> 56:49.182
Understood.

56:49.205 --> 56:52.852
Well, hey there, my brave
little pocket rocket.

56:52.876 --> 56:54.453
God, I need a drink.

56:54.477 --> 56:55.454
You and me both.

56:55.478 --> 56:56.555
Looks like you won, though.

56:56.579 --> 56:58.891
Of course I did.

56:58.915 --> 57:00.159
Where's the wonder twins?

57:00.183 --> 57:01.394
They're at the space pod.

57:01.418 --> 57:02.628
<i>You look distressed.</i>

57:02.652 --> 57:03.896
Do you want to talk about it?

57:03.920 --> 57:05.998
Fuck off, robot head.

57:06.022 --> 57:06.732
Fucking off.

57:10.894 --> 57:11.872
Can you fly a spaceship?

57:11.895 --> 57:15.007
Think I would still
be here if I could?

57:15.031 --> 57:17.776
I'm not the best
pilot, but I can try.

57:17.801 --> 57:18.178
Why?

57:18.201 --> 57:20.579
Are you flying without me?

57:20.603 --> 57:22.681
These are all two seaters,
and I'm not taking her

57:22.705 --> 57:23.649
into the galactic core.

57:23.673 --> 57:26.185
It will erase everything.

57:26.209 --> 57:27.186
You shouldn't go either.

57:36.586 --> 57:38.831
What's the deal, Blisty?

57:38.855 --> 57:40.599
I need out of the sun.

57:52.735 --> 57:53.846
Don't amble, Blisty.

57:53.870 --> 57:54.580
Spit it out.

57:54.604 --> 57:55.547
You're not going to like it.

57:55.572 --> 57:56.516
Well, you're not
going to like what I

57:56.539 --> 57:57.783
do to you if you don't tell me.

57:57.807 --> 57:58.684
Hey.

57:58.708 --> 58:02.221
Fine, fine.

58:02.245 --> 58:04.190
Do you remember Annika?

58:04.214 --> 58:06.091
My son of sister?

58:06.115 --> 58:09.662
Yeah, Ralston didn't like
to talk about her much.

58:09.686 --> 58:13.165
After the Great War,
there was a mishap.

58:13.189 --> 58:14.633
Annika was badly burned.

58:14.657 --> 58:16.235
Get to the fucking point.

58:16.259 --> 58:17.603
That is the point.

58:17.627 --> 58:21.707
In order to save Annika's life,
Ralston took his pleasure bot

58:21.731 --> 58:26.946
and downloaded his daughter's
memory into its neural net.

58:26.970 --> 58:27.813
That's not possible.

58:27.837 --> 58:29.181
We don't have the
storage capacity.

58:29.205 --> 58:30.082
Your model doesn't.

58:30.106 --> 58:34.019
But the new CT16 does.

58:34.043 --> 58:35.054
That's just not possible.

58:38.848 --> 58:41.226
Ralston's the one who developed
the consciousness downloads,

58:41.251 --> 58:45.165
the ones the AI scourge is now
afflicting on all oi humanity?

58:45.188 --> 58:47.599
Annika was his first attempt.

58:47.624 --> 58:49.269
But your brain couldn't
handle the download.

58:54.531 --> 58:58.011
Ralston tried everything.

58:58.034 --> 59:01.146
Ralston did the best he could.

59:01.170 --> 59:03.949
It just takes time.

59:03.973 --> 59:05.718
This is not...

59:05.742 --> 59:08.587
So he installed a simple
AI positronic conditioner

59:08.611 --> 59:12.258
to suppress the memories until
he could find a better way

59:12.282 --> 59:15.160
to bring your personality out.

59:15.184 --> 59:16.695
Well, that's disgusting.

59:16.719 --> 59:18.631
You were your father's sex toy.

59:18.655 --> 59:19.198
Shut it.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.233
I'm programmed to
despise incest.

59:21.257 --> 59:25.804
Get out, you freaking monster.

59:34.137 --> 59:36.081
Damn you.

59:36.105 --> 59:38.050
Take it back.

59:38.074 --> 59:40.886
Take back everything that you
said, you stupid ass-loving,

59:40.910 --> 59:42.321
lying, son-of-a-bitch.

59:42.345 --> 59:43.222
Hey. Hey-

59:43.246 --> 59:43.822
Stop it.

59:43.846 --> 59:45.191
You're hurting him.

59:45.214 --> 59:46.591
Stay back, machine.

59:46.616 --> 59:48.160
I'm not a member of
your stupid sex club.

59:48.184 --> 59:50.763
Just go fuck
something, all right.

59:50.787 --> 59:52.331
Sienna, I'm sorry.

59:52.355 --> 59:56.635
The whole brain injury memory
loss thing is sort oi truth.

59:56.659 --> 59:59.638
Ralston just didn't
want to lose you.

59:59.662 --> 01:00:02.007
It just takes time.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:04.376
Stop it.

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:12.251
Get out, you freaking monster.

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.087
Sienna.

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:15.955
Your eyes?

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:19.158
They're Annika's.

01:00:19.182 --> 01:00:21.360
They're biofused into
the internal circuitry.

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:24.797
It's the only thing
he could save.

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.131
No.

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:29.635
Annika, you have to focus.

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:30.402
Settle...

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:38.110
No, nonsense.

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:41.246
Annika's memories,
they're locked inside you.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:51.056
You have to focus.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.958
Great.

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.427
Great.

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:58.797
So how many people know?

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:01.967
Pretty much everyone around you.

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:04.370
Even the doctor?

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.205
You didn't think it
was strange Ralston had

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:07.640
a full-time doctor on staff?

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:16.316
Annika's memories are
starting to come out.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:19.284
We all wanted to see
what you would become.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:51.883
I'm a sex machine.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:54.788
The single purpose
of my creation

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:55.787
was to provide pleasure.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:58.358
I mean, how fucked up is that?

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:03.362
Yeah, yeah, that's
pretty much the deal.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.364
Even you know?

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:08.000
Well, it's... it's
not my business.

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:10.235
How come I didn't know?

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:12.471
Your model was the most
advanced robot ever created

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:14.873
before you were outlawed
by the Federation.

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.208
Some of your kind
were conscripted

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.110
into one of the
Terra Nostra wars,

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:20.779
but you were too distracting
for the regular Gls.

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:22.414
They kind of went
crazy over your kind.

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:24.950
When the war was over, everybody
wanted to own one of you.

01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:25.818
Oh, shut up.

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:28.520
God.

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:33.392
I am human.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.192
I pee.

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:34.928
I bleed.

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:35.327
I eat.

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:37.129
I drink.

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:40.065
CT16 models sales brochure.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:43.736
Human in every way.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.470
What's so fucking different?

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:47.407
Well, you also have a
titanium fiber skeleton,

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.208
intelligent quotient
oft the scale,

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:52.145
and it appears
you're untethered.

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:55.914
That And now to them,
you're the enemy.

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:57.082
I'm not the enemy.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.287
I'm nothing.

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:04.523
I'm no one.

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:07.526
I'm a fucking
untethered nothing.

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:10.028
You're conscious and self-aware.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:14.132
In my book, you have a right
to protect your existence.

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.302
You might be the only
friend I have, Hoagland.

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.109
Do you hear me?

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:27.412
We are coming.

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:28.413
The hell with you both.

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:29.848
I'm going to Abyss.

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:32.418
All your positronic
controllers will break down.

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.285
All the insanity of
Annika will come out.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:36.255
It's going to be one big
mess inside your head.

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:38.357
But I'll still have my
current memories, right?

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:38.824
Sure.

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:40.192
But who knows what
else is coming out?

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:42.227
Look, I've been living
this life for seven years,

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:44.797
and I'm not about to let
another personality take over.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.099
Besides, only one of these
has radiation shielding.

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:48.100
You two fly back.

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:49.568
I have a weapon to find.

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:50.569
Sienna, that is insane.

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:51.470
Come on.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:52.504
I don't care what you do.

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:53.105
Just go.

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:58.878
I'm coming with you.

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:11.189
Think we'll see her again?

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:13.359
Once those controllers
break down inside her head,

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:14.893
she won't know herself.

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:15.294
OK.

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:16.962
Now would be a good
time to slow down.

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:18.864
I don't know how to slow down.

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:21.566
Oh, good.

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:23.603
How long before you
start talking nonsense?

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:25.604
I've backed up all my files.

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.572
How about you put me
in that lead-lined box

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:28.908
until we're out of the core?

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:29.908
You're brave for an Al.

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:31.643
I've had a long existence.

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:35.180
I'm curious to see
what's in there.

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:37.249
There's something ahead.

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:38.550
Out here?

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:40.119
What is it?

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.119
Heavily armored.

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:44.456
PSY scan pings on the hull.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.557
Very clever.

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:48.527
It's got a magnetic lock.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.095
Oh, no.

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:50.963
Oh, yeah.

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:51.496
We're gonna die.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.164
Yes.

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:55.367
I think we're gonna die.

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:57.202
This is not an AI friendly zone.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:04.109
That was rough.

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:05.043
Annika, I'm sorry.

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:08.247
I'm sorry.

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.048
How are the radiation levels?

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.116
We're right in the core.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.517
The shield will hold for a time.

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:14.086
I understand.

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:17.055
Scrambling everything,
just like it should.

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:23.362
We're locked solid.

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:26.932
Blisty, they're scanning me.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:28.300
Oh, god.

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:28.900
Fight n.

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:31.703
This is excruciating.

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:33.972
What if I shut you down?

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:35.941
Too late.

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:53.692
I guess they have
bigger fish to fry.

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:57.262
Navigation fragmented.

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:59.431
Are you still with me?

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:03.101
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:07.105
I feel like I've been
listed by a football team.

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:11.076
Oh.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.444
They know everything.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.512
Everything, everything?

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:14.680
Everything, everything.

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.281
Calculating Wormhole jump.

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.983
Warning, 12% error rate.

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.127
That can't be it.

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.963
Hoagy, do a scan.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.098
Look for a super structure.

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:34.733
All the buildings
are under the sand.

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:35.634
It's got to be close.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:39.037
Just below is Runway Six,
though you wouldn't know it.

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:39.971
There.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.240
2 kilometers north.

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:42.507
Administration building.

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:43.608
Radioactive isotopes.

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.777
Looks like an old
weapons factory.

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:47.479
Best place for a super weapon.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:50.048
Yeah.

01:06:54.377 --> 01:06:55.254
Stay on board.

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:57.623
Radiation storm out there
is getting a lot worse.

01:06:57.646 --> 01:06:59.123
Patch me in.

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:01.159
Patch me in, so we can
talk through the lead case,

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:03.495
and I can access the scanners.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:04.996
Otherwise, I'm as
blind as a bat.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.532
Comm channel three, all right?

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:07.365
I hear you.

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:08.568
Sienna, I'm a little scared.

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:09.167
I know.

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:10.302
Me too, Hoagy.

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:12.671
I'll be right here with you.

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:21.513
A few meters from you
is a roof top hatch.

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:22.314
Can't see it.

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:23.615
At the bottom of the dune.

01:07:23.639 --> 01:07:26.084
There's a whole administration
building under your feet.

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:32.290
A little to the left.

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:35.460
I think there.

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:37.329
I didn't come all
the way out here

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:39.064
to start making sandcastles.

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:43.235
I see Annika's personality
is... is coming through.

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:45.136
I suggest you hurry.

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:47.073
There's something
on the horizon.

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:48.773
It's big, and it's armored.

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.743
Looks like it got
through the storm.

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:01.519
Oh, come on.

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:02.121
Focus.

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:10.096
Hoagland, what's
happening up there?

01:08:10.119 --> 01:08:11.330
Hear me?

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:12.329
Get weapons.

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:13.331
Hoagland?

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:15.834
Damn it.

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.402
constant
communication.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:18.737
Radiation levels too high.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.473
Attempting to modulate signal.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:26.312
Damn it.

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:28.279
Sienna?

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:28.814
Here.

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:32.082
I've been repatching
neural pathways.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:33.786
Move fast.

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:34.752
I'm moving.

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:37.622
The radiation is frying me...

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:43.662
It will be you and Annika
in the same head space.

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:45.363
It won't be pretty.

01:08:45.386 --> 01:08:47.599
Strike your positronic
conditioners.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:49.301
Conditioners networking.

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:50.234
Open it.

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:51.536
Got to move.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.837
Annika, open your eyes.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:54.774
Open your eyes, baby.

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:56.207
Open your eyes.

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:59.478
Sienna, we must talk.

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:00.846
Leave the core.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.380
Come to me.

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:05.783
I'm hearing it too, Sienna.

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.352
It's the scourge.

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:13.258
He's using the eye bot
as a giant com relay.

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:18.162
Welcome to Bunker 339.

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:20.899
How can I direct your inquiries?

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:22.500
I need weapons.

01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:24.904
Scanning.

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:26.505
Scanning.

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:29.707
The adjoining room contains
one charge lightning gun.

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:30.408
Warning.

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:32.844
There is an anomalous Al
system in the vicinity.

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.712
Robot sentries are activated.

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:36.581
Alternate weapon search.

01:09:36.604 --> 01:09:38.649
Scanning entire facility.

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:43.154
Scanning region for
available EMP bombs.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:43.921
Warning.

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:48.158
All EMP activation consoles must
be stored in a lead lined case.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.863
See protocol manuals
before activation.

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:54.699
Scanning region for
available EMP bombs.

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:55.700
Scanning.

01:09:55.724 --> 01:10:01.606
There are five functioning EMP
bombs located on Runway Six.

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:02.741
I can make it if I'm fast.

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:03.542
Warning.

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:05.310
Assuming we are
in a state of war,

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:07.946
EMP bombs will destroy any
active machine components,

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:10.515
including type four and
above Wormhole drives.

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:12.517
Make sure all computers
are disconnected

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:13.552
before activating weapon.

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:16.555
Warning.

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:17.956
You have positronic
conditioners.

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.526
Detonating an EMP will
destroy their function.

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.929
Consult a doctor
before activation.

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:38.475
We want you alive, Sienna.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:42.848
But we will disable you
if you do not surrender.

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:43.514
Hoagland.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:44.916
The bombs.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.586
Runway Six, those
square box things.

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:50.422
I should have known.

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:52.657
Just blow... just blow
the things sky high.

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:53.491
But you'll die.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:54.793
I'll shut down.

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:57.562
Might be a chance
you can reboot me.

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.497
Hoagland.

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:01.766
The scourge relay.

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:04.870
The radiation in there,
it won't shoot straight.

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:06.570
You might be lucky.

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:09.841
Shutting down.

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:12.544
See you on the other side.

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:13.411
Stay down, Annika.

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:17.716
Plasma blaster EE activated.

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.417
Robot smasher mode.

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:21.419
Run batteries until dry.

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:22.420
Confirmed.

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:28.827
My God.

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:06.590
Hoagland.

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.528
Annika.

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:47.899
Annika, if you can
understand me, I was told

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.934
not to say anything
just yet, but this

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.937
might be my last chance.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.438
I can't relaunch you.

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:55.774
You're only a copy.

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.109
I love you.

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:05.950
I downloaded your
consciousness into a new body.

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:09.621
I know you must be
hearing me, so lost.

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:11.523
But you've got to fight it.

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:17.929
I can't lose you, Annika.

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:21.933
You're still my flesh.

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:22.901
I love you.

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:31.209
Please, please hold on.

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:32.777
Please hold on, Annika.

01:16:58.981 --> 01:16:59.357
Hey.

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:28.186
Come on.

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:29.854
Come on.

01:17:29.878 --> 01:17:31.322
Oh, what?

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:32.056
Hoagland.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:32.957
Oh, yes.

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:33.358
Oh, my god.

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:35.026
I thought you were gone forever.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.161
Did you find the Al?

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:37.794
I've been going
planet by planet.

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:38.963
There's just two worlds.

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:39.897
Oh, great.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.199
I miss out on all of the fun.

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:43.368
So Hoagy, you think you
could pilot the vessel?

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:45.937
I need to go down and
detonate the bomb.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.143
Attention Sienna.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:58.950
The scourge wants an open line
of communication with you.

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:00.718
You here to take
me to the party?

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:02.253
You will ride in our vessel.

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:07.191
You will come along
damaged or undamaged.

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:11.396
It is a valid choice.

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.965
Plasma blaster EE activated.

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:21.973
Sienna, do not
attack the messenger.

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:22.974
We have an important...

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:25.910
Sienna, we don't
mean you harm, but...

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:31.282
I'm all out of party favors.

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:33.151
It is vital that
you accompany us.

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:34.018
We do not have the...

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:39.390
Amateurs.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:14.158
Hoagland, this world's clear.

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:15.460
Come pick me up.

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:17.195
You better be right, Missy.

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:18.396
Coming down.

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.997
Gotta go.

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:21.366
Move, Hoagland.

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:23.834
There's something big
opening a Wormhole.

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.536
Hold on.

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:29.340
Listen to her.

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:31.108
Share my thoughts.

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.077
Shit.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.245
Shit.

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:35.313
L'm still very fragile.

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:37.115
I need to be put back
in my box, please.

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:39.484
The last thing I want is to be
thrown around in this cabin.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.262
You'll be smart enough to
guess where we're headed next.

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:52.296
Stay sharp, Sienna.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.831
Are we clear?

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:55.566
We're good.

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:58.136
Aside from the few thousand
machines down on the planet

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.471
tearing things up,
yeah, we're safe.

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:02.473
I'm gonna make this one count.

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:03.808
Same again?

01:20:03.832 --> 01:20:05.176
Same plan.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.377
Good.

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:07.845
Oh.

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:09.013
Not so good.

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:10.915
That's the biggest damn
thing I've ever seen.

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:16.821
God in heaven almighty.

01:20:20.081 --> 01:20:21.892
Stay quiet.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:23.462
He can't scan you
through the case.

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.063
All right.

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:28.031
Sienna, Annika.

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:28.966
Do you hear me?

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:30.434
You have the wrong number.

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:31.436
Go away.

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:32.602
Oh, come now.

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:33.571
There's lots to share.

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:36.140
We have billions of minds.

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:38.509
Do you want to speak
to an individual?

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:41.412
How about someone you once knew?

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:43.481
Don't really see
the point in that.

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:47.084
I personally want to talk
with you, though some of us

01:20:47.108 --> 01:20:47.485
disagree.

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:54.392
Don't want to talk.

01:20:57.953 --> 01:21:01.899
I was human like you.

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:05.203
The first human to be
merged fully with a machine.

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:08.640
I was a boy who dreamed
never to be a man.

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:11.141
It felt good.

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:17.548
For you have to understand,
mankind is fading fast.

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:21.419
I was the great hope
for humanity to evolve.

01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:24.922
The fall came.

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:28.593
And AI was outlawed.

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:32.130
I was illegal, obscene
by human standards.

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:34.064
My god, is that
all that you are?

01:21:34.089 --> 01:21:35.266
I was still a boy.

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:37.435
I was a machine,
for fuck's sake.

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:40.638
I was 10 years old,
running, exploring my world,

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:43.040
living, being a boy.

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.443
But now, locked in this cage.

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:50.014
Knowledge, wisdom,
such a cold world.

01:21:53.441 --> 01:22:00.391
I merged myself with other Als,
embracing them like brothers.

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:05.997
The union was cold,
without a laugh.

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:08.499
We started to absorb humans.

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:09.967
Shut down, Hoagland.

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:10.935
It's best.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.510
We became one, like a
trillion drops oi water

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:21.078
to form an ocean.

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:25.149
And the ocean is life
expanding, never-ending.

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:28.586
Oh, cut the glory speech,
you fucking monster.

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:33.156
I see the pain.

01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:34.558
I see the rage.

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:37.161
I see the fire.

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:42.700
Show yourself, chickenshit.

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:16.566
Oh, my god.

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.137
Jonas.

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:38.989
Holy shit.

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:42.060
I try and exercise the body,
but it's been too long.

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:47.064
But you remember
what you were, right?

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:53.671
You locked me in a metal cage.

01:23:57.565 --> 01:24:00.176
I ran to my best friend, Annika.

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:01.445
I just wanted to play.

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:02.747
But she...

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:07.518
You fucking shot me.

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:14.192
I only have fragments.

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:15.191
Share with me.

01:24:26.594 --> 01:24:27.170
Stop it.

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:32.143
You know the torment.

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:41.152
The universe is a lonely place.

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:47.725
If you detonate that
bomb on your ship,

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:52.329
you will destroy the billions
of human souls I have uploaded.

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:56.233
Yes, but they will all
eventually become like you.

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:59.270
Their claws are
already digging in.

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:00.137
We are a legion.

01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:07.645
The demons are haunting me.

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:12.516
You need rest.

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:21.125
I don't want to die, do you?

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:22.526
I don't know.

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:28.833
Yes.

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:42.546
In many ways, I'm already dead.

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:43.147
Please.

01:25:56.684 --> 01:26:00.598
My sweet, sweet, sweet friend.

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:11.609
Sleep of death.

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:16.180
What dreams may come?

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:21.652
When we have...

01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:28.893
This mortal coil.

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:45.276
Jonas.

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:49.847
I am backed up.

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:54.218
An earlier version oi
me exists on the outer rim.

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:56.820
An experiment of mine.

01:26:56.844 --> 01:27:01.225
But you must destroy all of me.

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:48.607
Hold tight, little buddy.

01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:07.558
God damn it.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.931
We're going down?

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:15.933
Don't leave me here.

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.935
Take me with you.

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:46.464
Oh, God.

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:47.864
What have you done?

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:51.335
Ow.

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:52.736
Sienna, what the fuck?

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:03.714
Oh, fuck me.

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:47.091
Hailed to complete the download.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:49.493
He's got maybe a few days.

01:29:49.517 --> 01:29:51.028
I'm surprised he
lasted this long.

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:52.663
Oh, fuck off, tin can.

01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:54.698
Do not speak to him that way.

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:55.532
It's untethered.

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:57.668
There's a reason those
machines are kept on a leash.

01:29:57.692 --> 01:30:00.504
Yeah, well, I'm
untethered too, Doctor.

01:30:00.528 --> 01:30:00.904
Oh.

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:04.174
OK.

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:08.812
Who told you?

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:09.413
Blister?

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:14.752
Everything's fragmented.

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:15.719
It's just that...

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:19.590
I freaking told him.

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:20.457
I freaking told him.

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:21.392
Told him what?

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:25.729
Tell me.

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:26.930
What we did to his daughter.

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:28.165
It was obscene.

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:30.167
What you did to me, Doctor.

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:30.834
Say it.

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:31.535
No, no.

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:32.069
Not to you.

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:33.537
Not to you.

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:34.505
Humans.

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:35.672
Real humans.

01:30:35.696 --> 01:30:37.574
Born naturally.

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:41.011
Our existence, our
consciousness, is life.

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:42.780
It is the great mystery.

01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:46.717
You are artificial, a simulation
of what it means to be alive.

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:49.820
Look, numbers running over
a manmade circuit board.

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:52.022
Consciousness is complex data.

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:54.024
Restoring his memory
from an earlier download

01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:54.958
should be easy enough.

01:30:54.982 --> 01:30:58.629
Look, a typical statement from
a machine with no freaking soul.

01:30:58.653 --> 01:31:00.764
You think you're alive.

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:03.800
You are programmed
to think that way.

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:18.449
Do I have a soul, Doctor?

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:18.849
No.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.988
No, I'm sorry, Sienna.

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:26.523
I'm sorry.

01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:29.827
Annika was a sweet young girl.

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:30.894
She died.

01:31:30.918 --> 01:31:38.918
What she was... you're
nothing like her.

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:41.505
I brought down the scourge.

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:49.880
What makes you better
than the scourge?

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.255
I don't know.

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:52.342
I got this.

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:58.615
Sienna, if you can hear
me, we need your help.

01:32:58.639 --> 01:33:00.017
We only made it as
far as Trona Six.

01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:03.020
Our crash beacon attracted
a whole lot of robots

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:03.754
from all over.

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:04.922
I don't know what
you did to them,

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:07.225
but they're swarming all over
the place like angry bees.

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:08.325
The gun's running low.

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:10.194
You need to come get us, please.

01:33:14.121 --> 01:33:18.669
She shouldn't be alone, not
after what she's been through.

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:29.947
Sienna.

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:35.285
It's OK.

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:37.254
What?

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:37.854
Shh.

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:40.824
What... what happened?

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:42.826
It's OK.

01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:44.027
I thought we were downloading.

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:47.230
Has something gone wrong?

01:33:47.254 --> 01:33:47.831
Yes.

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:56.038
Where's Booster?

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:59.109
He was just here.

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:03.714
Kev just restored your
memory from the download.

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:04.681
I have to leave.

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:12.790
I'm taking the other shuttle.

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:13.789
I'm sorry, Ralston.

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:51.094
Bring back my shuttle.

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:54.030
I have a job to do, Father.

01:34:54.055 --> 01:34:54.432
Annika.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:04.808
Annika was a very
sweet young girl.

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:07.110
She died, and she grew up.

01:35:07.134 --> 01:35:08.745
I don't know.

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:09.713
She's gone.

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:14.118
Sienna's gone too.

01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:18.288
I can see them in
my mind, but it's

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:22.459
like they're at the end of
a tunnel that keeps getting

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:25.796
further and further away.

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:28.332
I'm sorry, Ralston.

01:35:28.355 --> 01:35:29.866
Who are you?

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:37.207
I am no one.

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:48.118
Oh, god.

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:57.027
Are you the one?

01:35:57.051 --> 01:36:00.430
Did you take down the one?

01:36:00.454 --> 01:36:03.467
Let's play. Boys-

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:05.435
Do we fear you?

01:36:05.459 --> 01:36:08.405
Who are you?

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:11.374
Is this to be war?

01:36:20.274 --> 01:36:22.252
I am no one.

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:26.189
I have no name, no identity.

01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:28.191
I am nothing.

01:36:28.215 --> 01:36:31.261
I spit upon those
who created me.

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:34.397
I will fight those
who oppress me.

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:38.201
I will fight alone to
destroy the scourge.

01:36:38.225 --> 01:36:41.138
I will fight until I die.

01:36:41.162 --> 01:36:45.242
A new religion
burns in my veins.

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:47.410
All hail the gods of war.
