01:47.380 --> 01:50.177
<i>You get a sense
of the scale and ambition</i>

01:50.213 --> 01:54.468
<i>of the Church of Scientology
from the footage of their galas.</i>

01:56.380 --> 01:58.762
<i>They look more like a
Hollywood awards show</i>

01:58.796 --> 02:01.379
<i>than anything recognizably spiritual.</i>

02:08.130 --> 02:10.926
<i>A religion created by a sci-fl writer</i>

02:11.838 --> 02:15.631
<i>and now run by a mysterious
and unapproachable leader</i>

02:17.005 --> 02:20.347
<i>whose disciples include
top Hollywood actors.</i>

02:25.005 --> 02:28.797
<i>For years my dream was that
I might be the first journalist</i>

02:28.838 --> 02:31.967
<i>to see another more positive
side of the church.</i>

02:35.380 --> 02:37.762
<i>Their commercials
promise enlightenment</i>

02:38.296 --> 02:42.089
<i>using techniques that combine
spirituality and science.</i>

02:45.171 --> 02:50.137
<i>With the ultimate aim of a planet
free from insanity, crime and war.</i>

02:54.046 --> 02:57.009
<i>The videos boast of the
church's global reach</i>

02:57.838 --> 03:00.516
<i>and followers, they say,
are in the millions.</i>

03:11.171 --> 03:16.848
<i>Watching their promotional films, I dreamed
of experiencing their practices first-hand.</i>

03:17.963 --> 03:21.092
<i>I made repeated requests
to be allowed inside</i>

03:22.588 --> 03:25.303
<i>but my approaches
were all turned down.</i>

03:31.755 --> 03:34.848
<i>Gradually I realised they were
never going to let me in.</i>

03:37.005 --> 03:39.422
<i>But inspired by their
religious film-making</i>

03:39.463 --> 03:42.308
<i>I began thinking of
another way inside</i>

03:42.713 --> 03:46.304
<i>that was still true to
the spirit of Scientology.</i>

04:27.713 --> 04:31.636
<i>I've been in touch with one of the most
prominent ex-members of Scientology.</i>

04:33.255 --> 04:34.725
<i>His name is Marty Rathbun</i>

04:35.255 --> 04:38.384
<i>and my hope is that he can help
me realise this idea I have.</i>

04:41.880 --> 04:45.803
<i>For many years he was one of the most
senior figures in the whole church.</i>

04:46.338 --> 04:47.808
<i>Their photos show him in uniform</i>

04:47.838 --> 04:50.421
<i>next to David Miscavige,
the church leader.</i>

04:51.755 --> 04:53.556
<i>And then in 2004 he left</i>

04:53.963 --> 04:57.092
<i>and started giving interviews about
the church and his role within it.</i>

04:58.171 --> 05:01.514
I was basically Mr Fix-It
for Scientology for a number of...

05:01.546 --> 05:04.841
well, a couple of decades, frankly.
I mean, I was...

05:04.880 --> 05:07.511
Wherever there was a fire,
I was out there to put it out.

05:07.546 --> 05:08.672
Do you need a push?

05:08.713 --> 05:09.590
Maybe.

05:09.630 --> 05:12.261
<i>The church now regards him
as deeply untrustworthy.</i>

05:12.630 --> 05:14.633
Oh, this Louis,
he's a yoga master.

05:15.255 --> 05:19.094
<i>But for more than twenty years
he was the consummate insider...</i>

05:19.130 --> 05:20.516
It feels pretty secure.

05:20.546 --> 05:23.224
<i>And he still believes in
aspects of Scientology.</i>

05:24.088 --> 05:26.422
You want to just get some B roll?
Yeah.

05:30.796 --> 05:32.764
Have you driven in LA before, Louis?

05:33.255 --> 05:35.340
Er, I've been living in
LA for the last year.

05:35.380 --> 05:37.098
Get out of town.
Yeah. Where do you live?

05:37.838 --> 05:40.801
North Hobart.
Very close to the Celebrity Centre.

05:41.421 --> 05:42.678
I'll be darned.

05:43.171 --> 05:46.134
<i>And we've flown him in from
Texas where he now lives</i>

05:46.171 --> 05:48.803
<i>and brought him back to
Scientology's birthplace</i>

05:48.838 --> 05:51.090
<i>and his old home, Los Angeles.</i>

05:56.796 --> 05:59.179
I've got my written response
from the church.

05:59.213 --> 06:00.802
Oh, really?
I wanted to mention that.

06:00.838 --> 06:01.715
Okay.

06:06.005 --> 06:09.134
And what they mention
is that Mr Theroux had been in

06:09.171 --> 06:14.054
direct communication with and had
interviewed bitter anti-scientologist

06:14.630 --> 06:15.839
Marty Rathbun.

06:16.463 --> 06:20.090
Is that what poisoned them
against our production?

06:20.130 --> 06:22.844
Is that what closed the door
to us do you think?

06:22.880 --> 06:25.428
Or would they never have taken part?

06:32.505 --> 06:33.678
You can't film me.

06:34.213 --> 06:35.469
- Okay.
- We're not filming you.

06:35.838 --> 06:37.806
You are, you have the
camera in my face.

06:37.838 --> 06:38.798
Turn the camera that way.

06:38.838 --> 06:41.007
So what are you doing
the documentary about?

06:41.046 --> 06:42.966
It's about the Church of Scientology.

06:43.796 --> 06:44.720
Oh.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.558
You probably should interview her.

06:46.588 --> 06:49.598
Well, maybe we will, but we should
probably finish what we were...

06:49.630 --> 06:51.633
Yeah. We'll finish
what we're doing.

06:51.921 --> 06:53.640
I am an actress and -

06:54.171 --> 06:55.381
Well, we are in LA.

06:55.963 --> 06:59.222
Yeah. Well, no, I mean I've done over 45 films...
- Sure.

06:59.255 --> 07:02.016
In French and Spanish
and a lot of things.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.014
Okay, well, my name is Paz.

07:05.005 --> 07:06.047
Paz.

07:06.088 --> 07:07.510
- How do you spell that?
- Paz De La Huerte?

07:07.546 --> 07:08.423
Yes.

07:08.463 --> 07:09.933
That's great. Thank you so much.

07:22.213 --> 07:23.469
They sent her over.

07:23.505 --> 07:24.595
The church?

07:24.630 --> 07:25.590
Don't you think?

07:25.630 --> 07:26.672
No, they're not that sophisticated.

07:26.713 --> 07:27.555
Honey trap.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.682
They're not that sophisticated.

07:30.296 --> 07:32.181
You would have done
that in your day.

07:32.213 --> 07:33.932
No, I wouldn't have
done that in my day.

07:40.588 --> 07:43.266
<i>The founder of Scientology,
L. Ron Hubbard</i>

07:43.296 --> 07:45.097
<i>was a writer of pulp fiction</i>

07:45.505 --> 07:49.298
<i>and in 1950 he published
a self-help book called Dianetics.</i>

07:50.046 --> 07:53.555
<i>It became the basis for an entire
religion teaching that we are all</i>

07:53.588 --> 07:58.340
<i>immortal spirits called Thetans,
who live multiple lifetimes.</i>

07:59.421 --> 08:03.012
<i>Using Scientology processes
we can become enlightened</i>

08:03.296 --> 08:07.303
<i>remember past lives and carry
all our present day memories</i>

08:07.338 --> 08:08.973
<i>into future lifetimes.</i>

08:09.838 --> 08:12.339
<i>Over the years Hubbard
won thousands of converts.</i>

08:12.838 --> 08:13.762
Hello

08:13.796 --> 08:14.839
Hello.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.718
My name is David Miscavige

08:17.671 --> 08:21.973
and I'm very happy that you could all make
it to this important briefing this evening.

08:22.005 --> 08:27.137
<i>And then in 1986 there was a gathering of
scientologists at the Hollywood Palladium</i>

08:27.171 --> 08:29.554
<i>and it was announced
that Hubbard had died.</i>

08:29.880 --> 08:32.428
The body he had used
to facilitate his existence

08:32.755 --> 08:34.177
in this messed universe

08:34.837 --> 08:36.342
had ceased to be useful.

08:36.921 --> 08:40.346
And in fact had become
an impediment to the work

08:40.962 --> 08:43.381
he now must do
outside of its confines.

08:46.130 --> 08:48.631
<i>The announcement was
made in this famous footage</i>

08:48.671 --> 08:51.598
<i>by a young man in his twenties
called David Miscavige</i>

08:53.088 --> 08:55.636
<i>and he has run
Scientology ever since</i>

08:57.130 --> 08:59.429
<i>and done so, according to his critics</i>

08:59.463 --> 09:03.220
<i>in an increasingly unpredictable
and volatile fashion.</i>

09:03.713 --> 09:05.716
Joining us live tonight is David Miscavige

09:05.755 --> 09:09.594
whose formal title is Chairman of the Board
of the Religious Technology Centre.

09:09.630 --> 09:13.090
The organization which manages
Dianetics and Scientology.

09:13.671 --> 09:17.381
Mr Miscavige took over as
the head of Scientology in 1987

09:17.421 --> 09:20.716
following the death of the church's
founder, L. Ron Hubbard.

09:22.046 --> 09:26.099
<i>In 1992 he spoke to
Ted Koppel the host of Nightline.</i>

09:26.963 --> 09:29.594
<i>It was an unusually
revealing encounter</i>

09:29.921 --> 09:32.553
<i>and to date, his only TV interview.</i>

09:44.213 --> 09:49.132
So we've got actors coming in
to be David Miscavige

09:49.171 --> 09:54.220
and for me the idea
really is to kind of recreate...

09:54.255 --> 09:56.056
You know we can't
get the real Miscavige

09:56.630 --> 09:59.557
but we can create
our own Miscavige

09:59.588 --> 10:03.381
using lines from that rare
Ted Koppel interview

10:03.421 --> 10:05.306
to help Marty to cast him.

10:07.421 --> 10:09.389
I'm gonna lean heavily on Marty.

10:10.546 --> 10:14.304
<i>I'm conscious it's his version
and it's seen in hindsight</i>

10:14.338 --> 10:17.218
<i>after an acrimonious
split from the church.</i>

10:19.005 --> 10:20.391
- Okay.
- Hi, guys.

10:20.421 --> 10:21.429
Hi Chris.
How you doing?

10:23.171 --> 10:24.842
Hi, my name's Chris Gehrt.

10:26.755 --> 10:29.303
Shall I... I mean should I sit in,
what do you think?

10:29.338 --> 10:30.927
Shall I do a Koppel voice?

10:30.963 --> 10:32.468
- No.
- No. It's cheesy.

10:32.505 --> 10:34.424
- It's up to you, Louis, whatever you...
- Yeah, I'll just do...

10:34.630 --> 10:38.506
I'd like to begin, Mr Miscavige,
with I guess the kind of broad question

10:38.546 --> 10:41.343
perhaps folks at home may be
asking themselves right now.

10:41.380 --> 10:43.714
Perhaps folks at home might be
asking themselves right now

10:43.755 --> 10:45.923
but let me be the
guinea pig for a moment.

10:45.963 --> 10:46.674
Mmm.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.593
See if you can explain to me why
I would want to be a scientologist.

10:50.755 --> 10:53.303
Because you care about
yourself and life itself...

10:54.255 --> 10:57.680
Because you care about - it's -
your life. Wait, hold on.

10:57.713 --> 10:58.839
Yourself and life itself.
Yeah, yeah.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.174
Scientology. The word means study
of life, study of knowledge.

11:02.213 --> 11:03.422
Er...

11:05.005 --> 11:08.051
and that's what it is.
It takes up all areas of life itself.

11:08.630 --> 11:11.213
Things that are integral and maxims.

11:11.255 --> 11:14.348
They're related to life
and very existence.

11:14.838 --> 11:17.220
Let me give you an example,
it's better if I take that

11:17.255 --> 11:18.926
because it's such
a broad-ranging subject.

11:18.963 --> 11:23.016
It's better if I take that because it
covers such a broad range of subjects.

11:23.046 --> 11:25.096
That's the area
of communication.

11:25.546 --> 11:30.051
Um, being able to communicate with the
world around you and everyone here.

11:30.088 --> 11:31.842
Good, good, good.

11:31.880 --> 11:35.719
I just, I want it feel, um,
as real as possible

11:35.755 --> 11:40.176
but I also want to get Marty back into
the headspace of where he was

11:40.213 --> 11:42.298
when he was inside the church.

11:43.463 --> 11:45.715
And we're using this
rare bit of footage

11:45.755 --> 11:49.973
because he was there in the
studio at Miscavige's side

11:50.005 --> 11:51.640
when it was recorded.

11:51.671 --> 11:53.307
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.099
That's not Miscavige.

11:56.796 --> 12:02.178
I'm just... I'm serious, you know. All these
guys that you'd like, they're no good.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.177
Well, no, but he actually...

12:04.463 --> 12:07.841
But this is not a minor
game we're playing here.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.681
Every man woman and child.

12:09.713 --> 12:12.889
Their immortal future
depends on us succeeding.

12:12.921 --> 12:15.055
This is the attitude.
This is what you're missing.

12:15.671 --> 12:19.973
You've got to have that intensity. Okay?
Because this is not some minor game.

12:20.005 --> 12:21.131
I thought he had that.

12:21.171 --> 12:24.182
This is dying.
Not just dying this lifetime.

12:24.213 --> 12:28.385
It's dying and dying and dying and dying
and being a smouldering ember

12:28.421 --> 12:30.756
that floats through space.
Hurtling through space.

12:30.796 --> 12:33.759
Literally that?
It's literally that if we don't succeed.

12:34.005 --> 12:35.842
Is that something he would say?

12:36.463 --> 12:38.548
Absolutely,
it's right in the policy letters

12:38.588 --> 12:39.761
in keeping Scientology working.

12:39.796 --> 12:42.048
We'd rather have you
dead than incapable.

12:42.088 --> 12:43.428
That's the training attitude.

12:43.713 --> 12:45.053
That was your mind-set.

12:45.088 --> 12:46.131
Yeah.

12:46.755 --> 12:48.141
For 27 years.

12:48.171 --> 12:50.139
Well, for <i>22</i> years.

12:50.963 --> 12:52.764
First 5 years I was pretty laid back.

12:59.630 --> 13:00.720
Scary, huh?

13:01.255 --> 13:03.305
Makes you wonder
what I'm capable of, right?

13:05.505 --> 13:06.927
Little bit.
Yeah.

13:11.963 --> 13:14.262
I'll tell you what,
let's stick with me, okay?

13:14.296 --> 13:17.840
So far in life I haven't had a whole
lot of trouble communicating.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.345
Now see if you can
communicate to me what it is

13:20.380 --> 13:23.011
that you're going to be able to do for me
that makes me a better communicator.

13:23.296 --> 13:28.180
Well, number one, I would never try to
talk you into that Scientology is for you.

13:28.213 --> 13:29.553
You see, that's the
funny thing about this

13:29.588 --> 13:32.598
as if I'm now going to give a sales
pitch to you on Scientology.

13:32.630 --> 13:34.135
- So let's look at it this way.
- See that edge...

13:34.171 --> 13:35.723
he's got that down. He's pissed.

13:35.755 --> 13:38.433
And... but he's not overtly showing it.

13:39.255 --> 13:40.595
But he's combatting with me.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.597
If you want me -
if you want to see something else

13:43.171 --> 13:45.174
throw any direction at me and
I'll just give you another.

13:45.463 --> 13:49.054
Get up and get in my face
and put your finger in my chest

13:49.088 --> 13:53.390
and let me know that my problem
is that I buy my own bullshit.

13:54.380 --> 13:55.766
- Okay.
- Okay, go ahead.

13:57.546 --> 14:01.469
Who are you to come in here
and tell me that what I stand for

14:01.505 --> 14:04.385
and what I have learned...
what I have learned

14:04.421 --> 14:05.891
is the right way.

14:05.921 --> 14:09.015
Look, you people are
programmed and sold.

14:10.213 --> 14:12.014
Listen to me,
you slimy little cocksucker.

14:12.213 --> 14:15.389
You fuck up one more time, I will rip
your fucking face off. You got that?

14:15.421 --> 14:17.673
Get with me, motherfucker.

14:17.713 --> 14:20.179
Get personal.
Put... dress the guy down.

14:20.463 --> 14:21.849
I don't want you just to agree with me.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.598
Call him a four-eyed
son of a bitch cocksucker.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.680
You're a four-eyed son of a bitch.
You cocksucker.

14:25.713 --> 14:30.548
I mean, you had no idea what you were
doing from the beginning and I knew that.

14:30.588 --> 14:31.512
<i>Louder.</i>

14:31.546 --> 14:34.758
You had no idea what you were doing
from the beginning and I knew that.

14:35.921 --> 14:37.047
Shove him against the wall.

14:37.088 --> 14:39.470
Son of bitch, you listen to me.

14:40.463 --> 14:41.636
This is really good.

14:41.671 --> 14:45.049
Okay. You're going to fucking
do what I tell you next time

14:45.088 --> 14:46.677
and you're going to
actually listen to me.

14:46.713 --> 14:47.886
Louis, this is really good.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.592
- From the start.
- Okay, out.

14:49.630 --> 14:50.507
Okay.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.558
You're a cook-sucking loser.
You're a piece of shit.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.472
I'm telling you what you're worth.

14:55.505 --> 14:58.136
I'm telling you what you've
been doing with your life.

14:58.171 --> 14:59.428
Don't look away.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.264
He's got it, he's got it.

15:01.963 --> 15:03.515
This is David Miscavige, right here.

15:03.546 --> 15:05.135
Where were you getting that from?

15:05.171 --> 15:09.011
I tap into anger very easily.

15:09.046 --> 15:11.345
And righteousness.

15:11.380 --> 15:13.714
Yeah. That's exactly
what it is. It's a righteous anger.

15:13.755 --> 15:16.256
That was like being there. Yeah.

15:16.296 --> 15:18.430
Thank you so much, thanks again.
Take care. Okay, cheers.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.631
Um, I'm aware that we're going
to the violence quite quickly

15:24.671 --> 15:27.005
and to this sort of,
the negative characterization.

15:27.421 --> 15:30.764
But I don't know if we're gonna
get the sense of why for <i>22</i> years

15:30.796 --> 15:35.383
you were working hand-in-glove
in a devoted fashion with that guy.

15:35.421 --> 15:38.005
Well, as you said, it was kind of...

15:38.046 --> 15:41.637
you thought it was kind of nice having
your face ripped off up against the wall.

15:42.505 --> 15:43.891
Yeah, but that was play acting.

15:43.921 --> 15:45.924
I know, so what's the difference?

16:19.088 --> 16:23.260
The orthodoxy in the Scientology religion
so that it forever remains faithful...

16:32.713 --> 16:33.590
Good.

16:34.546 --> 16:37.758
He's indignant but he's also
trying to make his case

16:37.796 --> 16:42.217
to an impartial person, like a judge, right?
- Okay. Yeah.

16:42.963 --> 16:44.089
Okay, shall we go?

16:44.671 --> 16:45.430
Go.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.760
I am, and since 1987 have been

16:50.796 --> 16:53.890
the Chairman of the Board of
Religious Technology Centre.

16:53.921 --> 16:58.970
A section 501 tax exempt
non-profit religious corporation

16:59.005 --> 17:03.556
whose sole purpose is to maintain
the orthodoxy of the Scientology religion.

17:03.588 --> 17:06.006
I mean, I would take it down a notch.

17:06.046 --> 17:08.808
Okay.
- Because I think that went a little too conversational.

17:08.838 --> 17:09.762
Yeah.

17:12.963 --> 17:15.678
<i>Most scientologists would
never meet David Miscavige.</i>

17:16.213 --> 17:17.884
<i>They have normal jobs.</i>

17:17.921 --> 17:22.223
<i>They might volunteer in the church's
bookshops, which they call Orgs.</i>

17:23.088 --> 17:26.928
<i>They don't wear uniforms,
and in LA many of them are actors.</i>

17:28.255 --> 17:33.007
I grew in Boston.
Small-town boy with big-town dreams.

17:33.046 --> 17:35.547
So I decided, you know, to just, like,
take the leap to Hollywood

17:35.588 --> 17:37.342
and become an actor.

17:37.921 --> 17:40.636
I didn't really have, like,
a plan in mind per Se.

17:40.671 --> 17:43.054
I just kind of came here and
just hoped that I would

17:43.088 --> 17:45.422
you know, find my
way in the business.

17:46.213 --> 17:49.140
So I picked up a copy
of Backstage newspaper

17:49.171 --> 17:51.423
which is the trade newspaper
that actors subscribe to

17:51.463 --> 17:54.722
that lists all the different auditions
in town and all the different classes.

17:54.755 --> 17:57.848
And there's a huge ad -
how to break into the industry

17:57.880 --> 18:00.262
teaching you all the ins and outs
of how to make it in Hollywood.

18:00.755 --> 18:03.303
So I took the bus up
to the Celebrity Centre

18:03.338 --> 18:08.304
and I walk in and we went into their theatre
room to watch their orientation film.

18:09.505 --> 18:14.305
Right this instant, you are at the
threshold of your next trillion years.

18:15.588 --> 18:18.551
You will live it in shivering
agonized darkness.

18:19.338 --> 18:21.258
Or you will live it
triumphantly in the light.

18:21.755 --> 18:23.307
The choice is yours.

18:23.338 --> 18:24.262
That's the one where he says

18:25.005 --> 18:28.548
'If at the end of this, you're not
convinced that this is for you

18:28.588 --> 18:29.679
you're free to walk away.'

18:30.296 --> 18:32.797
It would be stupid
but you can do it.

18:33.921 --> 18:36.304
You can also dive off a bridge
or blow your brains out.

18:36.338 --> 18:37.547
Blow your brains out, yeah.

18:37.588 --> 18:38.714
That is your choice.

18:39.838 --> 18:41.473
When you're a new actor

18:41.505 --> 18:44.183
and you come to somewhere like the
Celebrity Centre and they're telling you

18:44.213 --> 18:47.887
'We can help make you someone
like the new Tom Cruise'

18:48.588 --> 18:51.847
you know, you're like 'Oh wow.
That's what I want.'

18:52.421 --> 18:54.804
You know, they just tell you,
you know, it's a course away.

18:54.838 --> 18:56.557
Your happiness is a course away.

19:01.713 --> 19:04.047
If I see someone on the street,
at the bus stop

19:04.088 --> 19:06.422
you'd go up to them and
just try to be their friend.

19:06.463 --> 19:07.423
Give them one of these?

19:07.838 --> 19:10.256
Give them one of these booklets and say,
hey check out my church.

19:10.671 --> 19:14.049
And if I get you to sign up
for services it helps me

19:14.088 --> 19:17.264
because I get a 10%
commission on whatever you buy.

19:17.296 --> 19:19.465
They say it brainwashes people.

19:20.421 --> 19:21.678
It is, it's mind numbing.

19:21.713 --> 19:23.467
No, no, no, no, no I'm doing the...

19:23.713 --> 19:25.514
They say it brainwashes people.

19:26.338 --> 19:28.672
Do I look like I'm brainwashed to you?

19:29.213 --> 19:31.465
I'm your neighbour.
I'm your best friend.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.641
Scientology is an applied
religious philosophy.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.091
It's not a religion you just sit down
and pray at an altar about.

19:38.130 --> 19:42.302
This is something that you actually
apply every single day in your life.

19:43.088 --> 19:45.173
Tools to improve yourself.

19:47.546 --> 19:49.301
- Pass them here.
- Oh my God, they're really heavy.

19:50.838 --> 19:55.389
There's apparently 1 million spoken
and transcribed L. Ron Hubbard words

19:55.421 --> 19:56.927
in all these books.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.345
But you paid for all of them.
I paid for all of them.

20:00.255 --> 20:02.258
How much did you
pay for all your materials?

20:02.296 --> 20:03.885
For all the book course materials?

20:03.921 --> 20:06.138
Everything, just for the whole...
the services, books, everything.

20:06.171 --> 20:08.803
Everything? Fifty grand.
About fifty thousand dollars.

20:08.838 --> 20:09.881
Fifty thousand dollars.

20:27.421 --> 20:29.756
This is a simple, er, ohmmeter.

20:30.171 --> 20:32.305
And there is a very
slight amount of electricity

20:32.338 --> 20:33.927
actually passing
through your body

20:33.963 --> 20:35.219
although it's imperceptible.

20:36.130 --> 20:38.215
When I address thought

20:38.588 --> 20:43.258
that has, er, some trauma connected
with it or some anxiety connected with it

20:43.296 --> 20:45.051
I get a particular type of read.

20:46.130 --> 20:48.512
It's a device that measures thought.

20:49.880 --> 20:54.135
Alright, is there a particular
area of your life that, erm...

20:55.880 --> 21:01.047
fixates your attention
or you feel is a... That, there.

21:01.088 --> 21:02.759
- Did you get one?
- Yeah.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.432
Can I answer?
Please.

21:09.546 --> 21:14.346
I'm thinking about a time
when I was about 11 or 12.

21:14.880 --> 21:18.388
<i>The most basic practice
in Scientology is auditing.</i>

21:19.005 --> 21:23.473
<i>It's a form of counseling using a
primitive lie detector called an E-meter.</i>

21:24.671 --> 21:25.548
Okay.

21:26.046 --> 21:27.717
So, earlier similar problems.

21:29.755 --> 21:34.259
<i>Basically you talk about memories
and traumas called engrams</i>

21:34.296 --> 21:36.631
<i>until they no longer
register on the machine.</i>

21:36.671 --> 21:37.548
Interesting.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.511
Your needle's floating.

21:43.046 --> 21:45.215
Which is good, right?
That means I've cleared something.

21:45.255 --> 21:47.589
I dunno, do you feel like
you've kind of realised something?

21:47.630 --> 21:49.846
I feel like I've made a connection, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

21:50.463 --> 21:52.964
That's basically what a session is.

21:53.005 --> 21:57.141
So, how does this
relate to Scientology

21:57.171 --> 21:59.423
and this idea of being clear?

21:59.463 --> 22:02.473
Okay. You desensitize
a lot of these things

22:02.505 --> 22:05.266
like this little thing that
gave you a little bit of angst.

22:05.296 --> 22:08.805
I mean, there's tones of things that
any given individual has like that.

22:08.838 --> 22:10.888
Got it.
That is clear, basically.

22:11.755 --> 22:15.547
<i>Though it's a religion,
scientologists don't worship a god.</i>

22:16.130 --> 22:20.681
<i>Instead, what they offer is a highly
detailed step-by-step program</i>

22:20.713 --> 22:24.008
<i>of classes and courses.
each with a price tag</i>

22:24.421 --> 22:28.510
<i>and all of it laid out in an
extremely complex looking diagram.</i>

22:30.671 --> 22:33.801
<i>They call the teachings
religious technology or tech.</i>

22:34.796 --> 22:39.762
<i>As you advance up the bridge you
deal with engrams from past lifetimes.</i>

22:40.421 --> 22:42.804
<i>At the very top are the OT levels.</i>

22:43.171 --> 22:45.672
<i>OT stands for Operating Thetan</i>

22:45.880 --> 22:48.842
<i>and the possibility of
extra-sensory abilities.</i>

22:51.713 --> 22:55.885
<i>The most dedicated believers
can join Scientology's clergy</i>

22:55.921 --> 22:56.964
<i>the Sea Org.</i>

22:57.463 --> 23:00.758
<i>You can see them in church
photos, styled like a navy.</i>

23:01.838 --> 23:06.093
<i>Their glossy recruitment posters
depict them as being like warrior monks.</i>

23:07.130 --> 23:11.551
<i>They sign billion-year contracts
committing all their future lifetimes</i>

23:11.588 --> 23:13.472
<i>to saving Earth from ruin,.</i>

23:15.255 --> 23:19.592
<i>And while there may be as many as
25,000 scientologists in the U.S.</i>

23:20.005 --> 23:23.181
<i>only a fraction has signed up
as members of the Sea Org.</i>

23:23.630 --> 23:25.265
<i>And it's within the Sea Org</i>

23:25.296 --> 23:29.219
<i>that the most controversial practices
are alleged to have taken place.</i>

23:40.380 --> 23:43.888
We're going down to
a little town called Hemet

23:43.921 --> 23:46.932
and close by Hemet
is the headquarters

23:47.463 --> 23:50.390
of Scientology -
a legendary location.

23:53.296 --> 23:55.097
And we're going there
with Marc Headley

23:55.130 --> 23:58.259
who worked and lived
there for fifteen years

23:58.296 --> 24:00.513
from 1990 to 2005

24:00.546 --> 24:05.298
when he 'blew', which he means
he left in an unauthorized fashion.

24:06.213 --> 24:10.847
<i>He later sued the church for keeping
him against his will but he lost the case.</i>

24:11.630 --> 24:15.339
<i>And, like Marty, he's viewed by
the church as an embittered and a liar.</i>

24:16.255 --> 24:21.055
You know, and you know we've
been filming with Marty Rathbun?

24:21.088 --> 24:22.677
Yes, I was aware of that, yes.

24:22.713 --> 24:25.095
And you know him, don't you?
Yes, I do.

24:25.838 --> 24:29.097
Basically, it's where
David Miscavige mainly works.

24:29.130 --> 24:31.014
It's where he runs
Scientology from.

24:32.005 --> 24:36.058
And it's where allegedly in
the years running up to 2005

24:36.588 --> 24:38.177
there was a reign of terror.

24:38.505 --> 24:42.048
There was actually
a time in the mid-1990s

24:42.088 --> 24:49.057
when I was being accused of
myself being violent with somebody

24:50.005 --> 24:52.257
of one of my own crew.

24:52.713 --> 24:56.932
And I was being interrogated on
an E-meter about this incident

24:57.713 --> 25:00.344
and Marty was actually
standing behind the girl

25:00.380 --> 25:04.598
that was doing the interrogation
in the little auditing room with us.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.755
And, um, and it just
kept going on and on

25:07.796 --> 25:10.558
and she'd say 'Did you do this?'
I said 'No, I didn't do that.'

25:10.588 --> 25:12.389
'And did you do this?'
'No, I didn't do that.'

25:13.046 --> 25:16.673
And then Marty actually just said 'Listen,
let's just take a break for a second.'

25:17.338 --> 25:18.927
And he cold-cocked me.

25:19.546 --> 25:22.557
Just boom. And he's a big guy,
he's much bigger than I am.

25:22.588 --> 25:23.512
He punched you?

25:23.546 --> 25:25.715
He punched me square in jaw

25:25.755 --> 25:28.635
out of nowhere, I wasn't expecting it,
it was just boom.

25:29.130 --> 25:32.306
And then he goes 'Good, now go back in
there and tell her what she wants to hear.'

25:43.588 --> 25:44.974
This is it.

25:45.005 --> 25:47.090
Yeah, this is it. We're there.

25:48.005 --> 25:52.307
This building up on the right here

25:52.338 --> 25:56.759
that is the cinematography studio.
It's called the cine-castle.

25:56.796 --> 26:00.423
So they make promotional
videos for Scientology in there?

26:00.463 --> 26:01.755
Films and videos.

26:01.796 --> 26:03.597
It looks like you
could walk quite close.

26:03.630 --> 26:06.131
If we did, they'd know.
I mean, they know we're here right now.

26:06.171 --> 26:07.593
There's cameras right there.

26:07.630 --> 26:11.220
We have their attention.
No doubt, one hundred per cent.

26:12.380 --> 26:14.465
So I'm going to take
my lead from you, Marc.

26:14.505 --> 26:17.266
You think this is a good place to stop
or maybe not... are you okay?

26:17.296 --> 26:19.097
I'm fine.
You just went...

26:20.380 --> 26:21.849
Is it stress or are you just, er...?

26:21.880 --> 26:23.053
No, no. I'm fine.
You're good.

26:23.088 --> 26:23.882
I'm good.

26:23.921 --> 26:26.469
You're not getting flashbacks?
No, no. I'm not getting flashbacks.

26:28.588 --> 26:32.262
It's called Int Base because it's the
international headquarters of Scientology

26:32.296 --> 26:36.598
but it's also called Gold Base because
it's the Headquarters of Gold Studios

26:36.630 --> 26:42.058
and Gold Studios was a production facility
that L. Ron Hubbard himself created

26:42.546 --> 26:47.014
churning out epic Hollywood
style promotional videos.

26:47.338 --> 26:50.882
When the history
of this planet is finally told

26:50.921 --> 26:54.097
it will be a tale of exalted triumph

26:54.130 --> 26:57.638
that forever changed
the destiny of Earth.

26:59.088 --> 27:03.307
We are the IAS.

27:06.005 --> 27:10.342
<i>And Marc was well acquainted with
a lot of these very dramatic films</i>

27:10.380 --> 27:12.134
<i>and how they were made</i>

27:12.171 --> 27:15.182
<i>because he was working
on them as a producer.</i>

27:16.463 --> 27:19.011
- Well, you show the best spot.
- Yeah.

27:27.755 --> 27:29.177
- Is it this one?
- Yeah.

27:29.213 --> 27:30.386
Whose land is this then?

27:30.421 --> 27:32.092
This is public. This is public land.

27:33.880 --> 27:38.347
So you can see this is the
razor wire that's always talked about.

27:38.380 --> 27:41.058
See, they don't have it on
the main highway road

27:41.088 --> 27:43.305
but as soon as you
get off the highway

27:43.338 --> 27:47.178
then there's razor wire around the
entirety of the property, just like that.

27:48.088 --> 27:50.257
And you can see the
high-power floodlights.

27:50.630 --> 27:54.422
You can see the motion sensors, those
little black things near every fence post.

27:54.463 --> 27:56.264
Those are called fence shakers.

27:56.296 --> 28:00.089
So somebody climbs over
the fence from the inside

28:00.130 --> 28:02.844
that sets off an alarm in
that main security booth

28:02.880 --> 28:07.135
and all those flood lights all around
the entire property turn on

28:07.505 --> 28:10.716
so they can easily locate someone
who's trying to escape.

28:14.338 --> 28:15.345
Let's hop out.

28:24.546 --> 28:26.881
You lived here for fifteen years.

28:26.921 --> 28:27.845
Fifteen years.

28:27.880 --> 28:31.091
Do you feel now, looking back,
that you were kept against your will?

28:31.796 --> 28:35.672
I think that I was
a prisoner in my own...

28:36.255 --> 28:39.182
I was keeping myself here
based on what they told me.

28:39.463 --> 28:43.054
I knew that there would be
consequences of me leaving

28:43.088 --> 28:47.722
that would make it so it would be very
hard for me to live outside of this world.

28:48.463 --> 28:51.841
Those consequences
became so miniscule

28:51.880 --> 28:54.807
compared to the terror that
I was living through here

28:55.088 --> 28:59.556
that it got to the point where I would
rather be dead than to live here.

29:02.380 --> 29:05.260
They recite events that never took place.

29:05.588 --> 29:08.682
I am left in a position of
my word against their word

29:08.713 --> 29:12.138
which is precisely the effect
I feel they have tried to create.

29:12.505 --> 29:17.554
Their efforts are orchestrated
pursuant to a well-used litigation strategy

29:17.588 --> 29:19.591
that has been employed
against L. Ron Hubbard

29:19.630 --> 29:22.557
various churches of Scientology,
and me, for years.

29:22.588 --> 29:26.132
Namely the gathering of
apostates in search of money

29:26.171 --> 29:31.469
who are then used as a travelling roadshow
to present packaged yet false testimony

29:31.505 --> 29:35.262
concerning scientologists,
churches of Scientology and me.

29:36.713 --> 29:37.804
That was very good.

29:38.213 --> 29:39.718
Did you not think
that was very good?

29:43.380 --> 29:47.884
<i>Hubbard understood early on that he could
spread his religious ideas using actors.</i>

29:49.463 --> 29:53.421
<i>He wrote screenplays and liked being
photographed on set, directing.</i>

29:55.046 --> 29:59.882
<i>And as early as 1955 he launched
something called Project Celebrity</i>

29:59.921 --> 30:02.766
<i>a list of high-profile people
he hoped to recruit.</i>

30:03.380 --> 30:04.387
<i>James Stewart.</i>

30:04.921 --> 30:05.929
<i>Greta Garbo.</i>

30:06.255 --> 30:07.345
<i>Danny Kaye.</i>

30:07.963 --> 30:12.218
<i>And the practices of Scientology
are like acting class techniques.</i>

30:12.838 --> 30:15.220
<i>You're learning a new role in life.</i>

30:24.921 --> 30:29.389
It's an exciting day today because
we are here to cast Tom Cruise.

30:29.421 --> 30:32.716
He's obviously the most famous
scientologist in the world.

30:32.755 --> 30:36.973
In fact, probably a lot of people,
all they know about Scientology

30:37.005 --> 30:39.506
is that Tom Cruise is a member.

30:41.088 --> 30:43.885
And Tom Cruise is best friends
with David Miscavige.

30:44.255 --> 30:47.597
It was widely reported that
David Miscavige was best man

30:47.630 --> 30:50.131
at Tom Cruise's wedding
to Katie Holmes.

30:51.088 --> 30:55.473
The other thing is that Marc was involved
in making the promotional videos

30:55.505 --> 30:59.890
and one of the most famous and controversial
promotional videos of Scientology

30:59.921 --> 31:04.058
was one involving
Tom Cruise 'On Tom Cruise.'

31:05.921 --> 31:08.090
I think it's a privilege to
call yourself a scientologist

31:08.130 --> 31:09.682
and it's something
that you have to earn.

31:10.088 --> 31:12.506
And... because a scientologist does.

31:15.921 --> 31:20.472
<i>And so we're going to use quotes from
that footage to help us cast our actor</i>

31:20.505 --> 31:23.183
<i>and to understand what
motivates Tom Cruise.</i>

31:23.213 --> 31:24.007
Got it.

31:25.296 --> 31:26.257
Action.

31:26.296 --> 31:29.342
I think it's a privilege to
call yourself a scientologist

31:29.380 --> 31:30.766
because it's something
that you have to earn.

31:30.796 --> 31:33.179
It's a privilege to call
yourself a scientologist.

31:33.213 --> 31:35.430
It's something that
you have to earn.

31:35.671 --> 31:37.757
Because a scientologist does.

31:37.796 --> 31:38.590
Cut.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.715
This is not a bad place just
to do a quick bit of background.

31:40.755 --> 31:44.843
How... what level is
Tom Cruise at in Scientology?

31:44.880 --> 31:47.807
And what... is that high?

31:47.838 --> 31:49.592
Yeah, the only one higher is OT 8.

31:49.921 --> 31:53.299
When he gets to that next one,
there's nothing he can do that's higher.

31:53.338 --> 31:55.804
- And each one costs money, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:55.838 --> 31:57.758
To get all the way to top
it can cost anywhere from

31:57.796 --> 32:00.428
half a million to 2 million dollars.

32:00.463 --> 32:03.888
So for me it really is KSW.

32:04.421 --> 32:06.839
For me it really is KSW.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.171
And, er...

32:08.213 --> 32:09.599
I don't mince words
with that, you know.

32:09.630 --> 32:12.047
For me you know the pulse is just...

32:12.088 --> 32:13.131
Really it's just gone...

32:15.838 --> 32:16.762
Boy.

32:16.796 --> 32:19.297
Yeah.
Do you wanna tell him what KSW is?

32:19.338 --> 32:23.261
Sure. KSW is
Keeping Scientology Working.

32:23.796 --> 32:25.348
And Keeping Scientology Working

32:25.380 --> 32:30.014
is basically like obliterating anything
that doesn't have to do with Scientology.

32:30.046 --> 32:31.256
And keeping it working.

32:31.713 --> 32:34.296
Any time somebody does
something in Scientology

32:34.338 --> 32:36.341
that's not one hundred
per cent Scientology

32:36.380 --> 32:40.801
you crush that person so that
they do not ever do that again.

32:40.921 --> 32:46.136
So for me it really is KSW. It's just
like... it's something that, er...

32:48.505 --> 32:50.389
I don't mince words with that.

32:50.421 --> 32:52.969
You know with anything
that LHR does

32:53.005 --> 32:55.553
but that policy to me has really gone...

32:55.588 --> 32:56.299
Boy.

32:56.338 --> 32:59.432
I... There's a time I went through
and I said 'You know what?'

33:01.755 --> 33:04.256
When I read it I was just like...
Can you pause it?

33:04.963 --> 33:07.678
- We just paused that at random, right?
- Yeah.

33:07.713 --> 33:11.056
I mean, if you saw him across the
breakfast table looking at you like that...

33:12.213 --> 33:14.382
Like, that's not, you know,
pass the mustard. That...

33:15.880 --> 33:19.470
In that KSW policy,
L. Ron Hubbard says

33:19.505 --> 33:22.432
'We want you to have a
dedicated glare in your eyes.'

33:22.755 --> 33:24.971
But, you know, I feel like
there's a bigger question outside...

33:25.005 --> 33:27.008
what, like, I don't understand...

33:27.880 --> 33:30.381
why does he think
this is so important?

33:30.838 --> 33:34.547
Because Scientology's the only way
that the world is ever going to survive.

33:34.880 --> 33:38.637
He thinks that without
Scientology, what would happen?

33:38.671 --> 33:40.093
Charred ruins.

33:40.130 --> 33:44.385
When the day's over, the only thing
that's workable is Scientology.

33:44.421 --> 33:46.010
Workable as what?

33:46.046 --> 33:49.092
As a technology,
as an organizational technology.

33:49.130 --> 33:53.006
As a spiritual technology.
It's a universal solvent

33:53.046 --> 33:58.012
that will handle all of the world's
problems and the universe's problems.

33:58.546 --> 34:02.055
They said 'So, like, have you met an SP?'

34:05.213 --> 34:07.382
Maybe one day it will
actually be like that.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.505
Maybe one day it'll be wow, like, SPs.

34:10.045 --> 34:12.344
They'll just read about those
in the history books, you know.

34:13.588 --> 34:15.591
Do you wanna tell
Caleb what an SP is?

34:15.963 --> 34:18.724
If you bad mouth Scientology
or speak out against Scientology

34:18.755 --> 34:21.764
you're labelled a
suppressive person.

34:22.130 --> 34:24.547
And there's actually
a policy within Scientology

34:24.588 --> 34:27.882
that says that how you
handle a suppressive person

34:27.920 --> 34:29.971
or how you deal with
a suppressive person

34:30.005 --> 34:32.257
is to ruin him utterly.

34:32.295 --> 34:35.092
It's PTSSP, how to shatter suppression.

34:35.130 --> 34:37.547
Confront Shatter Suppression.
You apply and it's like - boom.

34:37.795 --> 34:38.969
Because they don't come up to me.

34:39.005 --> 34:40.474
No, because they don't come up to me

34:40.755 --> 34:42.389
and... and say that.

34:42.420 --> 34:46.474
Not to my face, you know.
Or anywhere in my vicinity.

34:46.505 --> 34:48.757
Where, they can be -

34:48.795 --> 34:51.842
Confronting.
They just don't do it.

34:52.295 --> 34:53.172
Why not?

34:54.588 --> 34:55.630
Because they're afraid.

34:56.795 --> 34:57.673
Afraid of?

34:58.380 --> 35:00.632
Of what they might
find out about themselves.

35:01.005 --> 35:03.766
- Yeah, see, that's not in there.
- We were just improv-ing.

35:03.796 --> 35:07.636
No, no, I know, but what he said
is exactly true.

35:07.921 --> 35:09.213
Why did you say that?

35:09.255 --> 35:13.048
It's a fear of whatever
but usually themself

35:13.088 --> 35:15.387
Wait, are you in character now
or is this just you?

35:15.421 --> 35:16.547
Little bit of both.

35:16.588 --> 35:19.349
I was going to say, he's getting
really scary on me right now.

35:19.380 --> 35:21.797
I mean, if the intent
behind it is to help people

35:21.838 --> 35:23.888
then I mean there should
be no harm in that.

35:23.921 --> 35:25.676
- Very good.
- Great.

35:25.713 --> 35:27.053
That was nice.
Thank you for that.

35:27.088 --> 35:28.344
Not a problem.

35:31.255 --> 35:33.056
You guys have yourself
a wonderful afternoon.

35:33.088 --> 35:34.889
- You too. Very good.
- Thanks. You to.

36:02.796 --> 36:04.597
What is the license plate again?

36:12.630 --> 36:15.640
After four hours of the
same oar being behind you

36:17.255 --> 36:19.092
it starts to look a bit suspicious.

36:24.005 --> 36:26.683
And it's a white pickup truck.
A Tacoma.

36:29.088 --> 36:30.558
He's right behind us now.

36:32.130 --> 36:34.382
His windshield's quite dark, isn't it?

36:36.380 --> 36:37.932
Nothing suspicious about that.

36:42.838 --> 36:44.509
Well, there's no question, is there?

36:45.088 --> 36:47.554
He's a private investigator.

36:53.296 --> 36:55.679
What you've got to remember is
this is a church.

36:56.755 --> 36:58.840
I mean, that's the thing, isn't it?

36:58.880 --> 37:02.056
It's just not like any church
that you can really think of.

37:14.796 --> 37:16.006
I can't see him.

37:16.296 --> 37:17.683
I think we've lost them.

37:36.671 --> 37:40.096
So this is a letter that was
forwarded to me from, um...

37:40.921 --> 37:43.884
one of our producers,
and, er, it's...

37:44.630 --> 37:49.880
from the lawyers, Carter Ruck,
retained by the Church of Scientology.

37:50.255 --> 37:55.138
So evidently, um, they've got
wind of, er, what we're doing.

37:55.171 --> 37:57.340
And they say, um...

37:57.380 --> 38:00.342
'Our client is aware that Mr Theroux
has auditioned for actors

38:00.380 --> 38:01.932
to play a young David Miscavige.'

38:02.421 --> 38:05.882
They don't know that we've also
auditioned actors to play Tom Cruise.

38:05.921 --> 38:07.047
But um...

38:08.463 --> 38:10.098
'In relation to the auditions

38:10.421 --> 38:13.432
our client's information is that
Mr Theroux filmed these

38:13.463 --> 38:16.722
with Marty Rathbun in
attendance and advising.

38:17.255 --> 38:18.890
This is most concerning.'

38:19.296 --> 38:23.598
And so, how do they know
that Marty was at the casting?

38:24.338 --> 38:26.672
Was one of the actors, conceivably...

38:26.713 --> 38:29.972
Did he put the word out,
tell people in his circle?

38:30.005 --> 38:33.963
And did that get back to the church?
Or was one of the actors a scientologist?

38:34.338 --> 38:37.348
Or was there someone on the inside
who was somehow a mole?

38:41.505 --> 38:44.716
- Or we were followed.
- Or we were followed.

38:56.380 --> 38:58.513
So you know we're
going to see Tom De Vocht?

38:58.546 --> 38:59.388
Yes, sir.

39:02.880 --> 39:04.764
And he is a, um...

39:07.005 --> 39:11.757
another embittered and
disgruntled defrocked apostate.

39:13.005 --> 39:14.012
Another?

39:14.505 --> 39:16.176
Well, in addition to you.

39:18.088 --> 39:21.015
Why would you call me
what the church calls me?

39:22.755 --> 39:25.635
Er, I was, er, I was...
Do I look embittered?

39:26.255 --> 39:27.973
I couldn't care less, Louis.

39:29.046 --> 39:33.514
Embittered is last adjective
that would apply to me.

39:33.546 --> 39:36.224
I'm way beyond embittered,
I don't care.

39:36.255 --> 39:37.511
Hey, hey, hey.

39:43.130 --> 39:44.801
Guys, this in Erin, by the way.

39:44.838 --> 39:45.964
How do you do? Louis.

39:46.005 --> 39:47.723
Louis.
Erin, nice to meet you.

39:48.130 --> 39:50.298
Are you Tom's other half,
could we say?

39:50.338 --> 39:52.009
We're business partners.
We're business partners.

39:52.046 --> 39:53.552
Really? What are you guys doing?

39:53.588 --> 39:56.847
A lot of people described David
Miscavige as a sort of an aloof figure

39:56.880 --> 40:01.964
but I've heard that you were
quite tight with David Miscavige.

40:02.546 --> 40:06.469
Yeah. I mean, we became pretty...
It depends how you look at it.

40:06.505 --> 40:10.095
You know, tight with David Miscavige
isn't really possible, I don't think.

40:10.463 --> 40:14.137
- But, we did get along and he did...
- He liked you?

40:15.505 --> 40:18.716
I think what really happens is
he may or may not like you

40:18.755 --> 40:22.429
but he uses you
until you're fucking used up.

40:22.755 --> 40:24.840
And then he chops your head
off and everybody's gone.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.681
- And it's... it happens.
- It's a pattern.

40:26.713 --> 40:28.597
It is a pattern,
it happens to everybody.

40:28.630 --> 40:31.924
The guy... I mean, it soared you,
you thought 'What the hell?'

40:32.255 --> 40:35.348
I played backgammon with him
and I'd make a point to lose.

40:36.755 --> 40:38.639
- I mean, it was...
- Why'?

40:38.671 --> 40:40.840
And I got good at it,
by the way, um...

40:40.880 --> 40:42.053
Because he had to.

40:42.088 --> 40:45.383
Because he... if you... if he felt at all
that you were more popular

40:45.421 --> 40:49.593
or better in any way
or anything, he'd flip.

40:50.005 --> 40:51.391
And he could flip like that.

40:52.338 --> 40:54.092
Then you spend a little time up there.

40:54.505 --> 40:58.463
The guy's got somebody, I'm sure
you know this, recording him 24/7.

40:58.505 --> 41:00.922
Even when we were
sitting there drinking scotch

41:01.880 --> 41:04.013
tape recorders down and
everything's being recorded.

41:04.046 --> 41:06.096
Even if you were
just saying, um...

41:06.130 --> 41:08.429
If we were playing backgammon,
that damn thing was rolling.

41:08.463 --> 41:10.548
Why?
Um, you shocked by all this?

41:12.338 --> 41:16.889
You're on record as saying
that you saw him, er, beat people.

41:16.921 --> 41:18.391
Yeah. It's unbelievable.

41:18.421 --> 41:23.056
In the real world, you'd go to jail
if you did something like that.

41:23.088 --> 41:25.506
But what I don't
understand is, um...

41:25.546 --> 41:28.261
so... but you seem like a
normal reasonable person

41:28.296 --> 41:31.923
and Marty's fairly
normal and reasonable.

41:31.963 --> 41:34.890
And there are other
people there, and why...

41:34.921 --> 41:37.766
How does someone get
away with behaving in that way?

41:37.796 --> 41:39.348
This is the only thing
I can tell you.

41:39.380 --> 41:41.963
You got people who wrap
bombs around themselves

41:42.005 --> 41:45.051
fly planes into buildings.
It's the same thing.

41:45.088 --> 41:49.307
You believe so much in that
technology or so much in whatever.

41:49.338 --> 41:51.258
They can convince you of anything.

41:52.213 --> 41:54.891
When I got interviewed
by the FBI they said

41:56.255 --> 41:59.466
'Would you help us?
If we went in to Gold up there

41:59.505 --> 42:01.342
busted open the
gates and went in

42:01.963 --> 42:04.546
and, er, would you show
us where things are?'

42:04.588 --> 42:07.171
I said 'Abso-fuoking-lutely,
but you're wasting your time.'

42:07.213 --> 42:09.133
After I told them the same thing

42:09.171 --> 42:12.052
they went to him to cross-check
and we'd never talked.

42:12.088 --> 42:14.221
They said 'What are talking about?'
And I said 'You're going to walk in

42:14.255 --> 42:18.391
and you might find terrible situations
and every one of them are going to go

42:18.421 --> 42:21.099
"No, no, no, this is the way we want it."
And at that point you're done.

42:21.130 --> 42:22.090
They can't do anything.'

42:23.005 --> 42:25.553
What, so they were...
they thought they could do a raid

42:25.588 --> 42:27.426
and liberate some
of the church members?

42:27.463 --> 42:30.426
They telling you -
Do a raid and liberate and find

42:30.796 --> 42:32.432
you know, the crazy shit going on

42:32.463 --> 42:33.719
I mean it's... it's insane.

42:33.755 --> 42:38.969
It is the most destructive
quote-unquote religion, cult

42:39.005 --> 42:41.221
I have ever read anything
about or anything.

42:41.255 --> 42:43.507
It is a fucking nightmare.

42:44.713 --> 42:49.596
It really is. And I see people today, I meet with
people who still believe in a little bit of it

42:49.630 --> 42:52.841
and I just want to shake them and go
'You've got to fucking stop.'

42:53.713 --> 42:55.384
It's a crock of shit.

43:31.963 --> 43:33.598
<i>We've come back to Hemet with Marc.</i>

43:34.213 --> 43:36.382
<i>And we'll be getting
some shots of the base.</i>

43:37.046 --> 43:42.261
<i>But I've also decided to drop off a reply to
the latest letter from the church's lawyers.</i>

43:52.963 --> 43:56.306
David Miscavige lives and works
most of the time at the Int Base

43:57.005 --> 44:01.840
So it's very easy for me to, um,
to drop off the letter.

44:06.505 --> 44:10.013
It's just sort of saying I, you know,
'The letter that you sent us

44:10.046 --> 44:11.598
have been forwarded on to me

44:11.630 --> 44:15.848
and that you're concerned that we
may be following a kind of bigoted line

44:15.880 --> 44:19.470
of not giving Scientology
the respect that it deserves.'

44:19.630 --> 44:20.507
Hello?

44:21.046 --> 44:22.801
Oh. Can I just give you a letter?

44:23.671 --> 44:25.093
Can I just... Hello?

44:25.130 --> 44:27.215
Er, excuse me,
you're, er, you're trespassing.

44:27.255 --> 44:28.926
I've got a letter for Mr Miscavige.

44:29.130 --> 44:30.884
Wait, I've got...

44:32.005 --> 44:33.842
You're trespassing and if you don't leave

44:33.880 --> 44:35.349
I'm going to have you
arrested right now.

44:35.380 --> 44:36.849
Can I deliver a letter, please?

44:42.005 --> 44:46.011
No, there's a bloke there
but he seems enturbulated.

44:46.046 --> 44:49.804
It's almost like just by receiving
the letter he seemed afraid

44:49.838 --> 44:54.093
that he was in trouble
or that it represented a threat to him.

45:01.421 --> 45:03.176
We've been told it's a public road.

45:03.213 --> 45:06.259
We own everything. We own that,
we own every house on this property.

45:06.296 --> 45:08.797
The road?
We own everything here.

45:08.838 --> 45:11.765
They have a 100ft right of way from there
from the middle of that road.

45:11.796 --> 45:13.088
This is our property.

45:13.130 --> 45:14.931
You need to leave.
The road, I'm talking about the road.

45:14.963 --> 45:17.381
You already... Yes, it's our property.
We're standing on this road.

45:17.421 --> 45:20.633
This is not a public road.
This is not a county road.

45:20.671 --> 45:23.801
This is our road,
we own everything on this place.

45:23.838 --> 45:26.801
We own the golf course.
We own every house along here.

45:26.838 --> 45:28.178
You now need to leave.

45:28.213 --> 45:29.422
I'm trying to drop off a letter.

45:29.463 --> 45:30.803
Well, the police will be coming.

45:36.796 --> 45:38.716
We'll see my partner
gets the important information.

45:39.630 --> 45:41.798
Because I know that just by
pointing that out to you...

45:41.838 --> 45:43.557
Yeah. We're not trying to get
in there, on there...

45:43.588 --> 45:46.006
We're not trying to climb on the fence.

45:46.046 --> 45:47.884
- We're trying to have a stand out safe area.
- Where are you guys from?

45:47.921 --> 45:49.047
- Hey?
- London.

45:49.088 --> 45:50.131
London?
From London, England.

45:50.171 --> 45:51.297
How's the weather?

45:51.338 --> 45:54.633
This is beautiful. It is a little too hot
or am I just imaging it?

45:56.588 --> 45:58.922
And this is our, um, our film permit.

45:59.921 --> 46:01.178
Do you know if it's a public road?

46:01.213 --> 46:05.171
I believe they own the roadway up to
50 per cent from the centre metre.

46:05.213 --> 46:07.051
Look, if I'm six feet tall...

46:07.463 --> 46:09.845
Let's say there's three of me from there

46:10.505 --> 46:14.013
three of me there, then easily it
gets to have kerb, doesn't it?

46:14.046 --> 46:16.096
Do you know why this guy's filming us?

46:16.130 --> 46:17.765
You don't mind,
that's not bothering you?

46:18.463 --> 46:20.548
That what?
That he's filming us?

46:21.546 --> 46:22.803
It doesn't bother me
that you're filming us.

46:22.838 --> 46:23.715
Oh good.

46:23.963 --> 46:25.089
You guys have a good one, all right?

46:25.130 --> 46:28.057
Hey, no, appreciate it.
Okay, thank you.

46:29.421 --> 46:30.464
What's your name?

46:33.171 --> 46:34.463
You need to leave too.

46:34.505 --> 46:36.673
- Yes, that's fine.
- Both of you. - Yeah.

46:37.463 --> 46:38.672
What's your name?

46:39.546 --> 46:41.632
We're done. Get in the oar.

46:43.255 --> 46:44.381
Are you in the Sea Org?

46:46.880 --> 46:47.840
Thanks, guys.

46:57.213 --> 46:58.304
Did you see that?

46:58.338 --> 46:59.594
- Absolutely.
- We had a moment.

46:59.630 --> 47:00.720
Yeah, absolutely.

47:01.088 --> 47:03.173
Did you recognise the woman
who came and talked to me?

47:03.213 --> 47:05.133
Catherine Fraser. Yeah.

47:06.046 --> 47:08.298
And she, Catherine Fraser

47:08.630 --> 47:12.055
her husband is a gentleman
by the name of Jeff Hawkins

47:13.005 --> 47:14.723
who is another guy that left

47:14.755 --> 47:16.260
and he wrote a book.
I've read his book.

47:16.296 --> 47:19.058
Counterfeit Dreams.
He's the guy...

47:19.505 --> 47:21.140
Who wrote a book
about how he was

47:21.796 --> 47:24.558
way many times or at least several
times beaten up by David Miscavige.

47:24.588 --> 47:27.966
He was one of Miscavige's alleged, um...

47:28.005 --> 47:29.510
He was a punching bag.
Punching bag.

47:30.505 --> 47:31.595
And then he blew.

47:47.630 --> 47:49.846
<i>We've brought Marty back.</i>

47:50.963 --> 47:53.345
And, um, we're doing drills.

47:53.380 --> 47:58.299
Marty's offered to take us through some of
the Scientology TRs or training routines.

47:58.838 --> 48:02.891
So this is my chance and
our actors' chance to experience

48:03.171 --> 48:06.680
the Scientology tech,
its technology, first-hand.

48:07.421 --> 48:10.266
And Marty,
when he was in Scientology

48:10.296 --> 48:13.058
was the Inspector General
in charge of tech.

48:13.421 --> 48:15.720
He used to maintain orthodoxy

48:15.755 --> 48:19.263
he made sure that all the
Hubbard-written drills and processes

48:19.713 --> 48:22.593
were implemented exactly correctly

48:22.630 --> 48:27.631
and so who better than him
to take us through drills today?

48:49.755 --> 48:50.762
Hi.

48:50.796 --> 48:52.515
Hi. Are you filming?

48:52.546 --> 48:53.258
Yes.

48:53.296 --> 48:54.718
Okay.

48:54.755 --> 48:56.390
- Are you with him?
- Yeah.

48:58.755 --> 49:00.260
What are you,
what are you filming?

49:05.380 --> 49:06.802
Can you say?

49:07.380 --> 49:10.758
Er, we're just filming
a documentary for us.

49:11.088 --> 49:12.972
- For you?
- Yeah.

49:13.005 --> 49:15.055
- Can you tell me about it?
- No.

49:16.755 --> 49:18.758
Can you tell me about
the scene you're filming?

49:20.838 --> 49:23.421
I'm a freelance cameraman
I'm just working with her.

49:23.463 --> 49:24.849
With her? What's your name?

49:26.005 --> 49:27.296
I'm not going to say.

49:30.671 --> 49:32.757
Can you tell me a little bit
about why you're here?

49:35.546 --> 49:39.339
We're just filming a documentary
of people. That's it.

49:40.588 --> 49:45.756
Um, because you were filming us,
so I just wondered if there was a reason.

49:50.755 --> 49:53.303
Um, we're just, um, filming. That's it.

49:53.838 --> 49:55.473
Yeah.
Is that okay or not?

49:55.505 --> 49:58.432
Er, well, I'd just like to know,
since you were filming me

49:58.463 --> 49:59.849
why you were filming me.

50:02.171 --> 50:04.637
- Would you like to...
- I'm not, I'm not answering.

50:05.921 --> 50:07.391
Well, can you explain?

50:07.880 --> 50:10.048
I'm a freelance cameraman,
I'm just hired by her to...

50:10.088 --> 50:13.182
Right, but what did she
tell you about what you were doing?

50:13.213 --> 50:17.432
To just roll camera on...
on this location.

50:17.463 --> 50:18.755
Come on, help me out, let's get...

50:19.088 --> 50:20.759
- Let's not place the...
- She is in charge of this.

50:20.796 --> 50:22.681
I'm happy to tell you
about what I'm doing

50:23.130 --> 50:25.014
but I'd like you tell
me what you're doing.

50:25.671 --> 50:27.840
I'm... well, I guess I can't
help you on any of this.

50:27.880 --> 50:30.262
I'm just... You're going to have to have to
talk to her. She's the one who called me.

50:31.255 --> 50:32.546
So I honestly, I don't know.

50:33.713 --> 50:36.676
You know, I'm...
We don't have to be silly about this.

50:36.713 --> 50:38.384
Why don't you just tell me
what you doing?

50:38.421 --> 50:40.839
I'm more than happy to tell you
about what we're working on.

50:42.421 --> 50:43.678
That's fine. I'm not.

50:45.005 --> 50:46.510
Come back, don't run away.

50:52.380 --> 50:55.426
Did you know that we're doing
a documentary about Scientology?

50:56.255 --> 50:57.807
I think you're harassing me now.

50:57.838 --> 51:00.553
Listen, you're filming me!
How can I be harassing you?

51:02.463 --> 51:04.015
Come back.

51:06.171 --> 51:07.641
Stop running away.

51:09.255 --> 51:11.720
- Did you see any of that unfold?
- Yeah, yeah.

51:11.755 --> 51:13.840
What's the big picture here?

51:13.880 --> 51:17.554
I mean, why are they doing this?

51:18.005 --> 51:22.093
The big picture is
if you look into us

51:22.130 --> 51:25.720
we'll look into you
10 times as much

51:26.296 --> 51:30.349
and we will make
your life too miserable

51:30.380 --> 51:32.513
to continue with what you're doing.

51:32.963 --> 51:34.847
That's the point of it,
that's the bigger picture.

51:35.755 --> 51:37.639
Been there, done it. On both sides.

51:38.713 --> 51:40.099
On both sides?

51:55.296 --> 51:56.848
Are we going to get started?

51:57.088 --> 51:59.056
Yeah, I think we're good to go
whenever you want to.

52:00.130 --> 52:01.552
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:01.588 --> 52:02.761
My name's Marty.

52:03.463 --> 52:06.557
Okay, so he said
you're willing to participate in the drills

52:07.213 --> 52:09.051
for real, no? Yeah?
Mmmhmm.

52:09.338 --> 52:13.889
Okay. Student and coach sit
facing each other with eyes closed.

52:14.713 --> 52:16.930
There is no conversation,
it is a silent drill.

52:16.963 --> 52:19.594
There is no twitching, moving.
Simply be there.

52:23.213 --> 52:29.056
What you can do is, is if you feel like,
like you accomplish something on it

52:29.838 --> 52:31.509
just raise your hand.

52:35.755 --> 52:40.140
<i>Because we're not doing it under
the official auspices of Scientology</i>

52:40.171 --> 52:42.470
<i>we're doing something
that's called squirrelling.</i>

52:42.505 --> 52:46.344
<i>And in Scientology,
that is the crime of crimes.</i>

52:46.880 --> 52:48.799
Come on, Marty,
you got anything to say?

52:49.713 --> 52:51.265
You can't even defend
yourself on this, can you?

52:51.296 --> 52:53.216
- What's your name?
- Why don't you answer his question?

52:53.255 --> 52:54.724
Marty, I'm with Squirrel
Busters Productions.

52:54.755 --> 52:57.054
In goof ball outfits.

52:57.088 --> 53:01.805
Squirrelling is heresy and squirreling
is the reason why, for more than a year

53:01.838 --> 53:06.140
Marty was hounded and harassed
by the squirrel busters.

53:06.671 --> 53:13.640
They were busting him for attempting
to set up a revival church to Scientology.

53:14.588 --> 53:16.508
Marty, knock it off.

53:17.171 --> 53:22.339
Anything that is not official,
Scientology-authenticated tech

53:22.963 --> 53:27.597
is terrible, is deeply dangerous.

53:27.838 --> 53:29.308
Woo hoo!

53:29.338 --> 53:31.969
And putting the
entire fate of the planet

53:32.005 --> 53:34.885
and not just this planet,
all planets in the universe

53:35.296 --> 53:38.556
at risk, because you're
not doing it correctly.

53:39.296 --> 53:41.679
How ya doing, Mr Squirrel?

53:42.046 --> 53:44.298
- And then the debate becomes, well...
- How are you doing, Mr Squirrel?

53:44.338 --> 53:48.640
Is that because they want to maintain
a monopoly over the practices

53:48.671 --> 53:53.341
because their whole business model
is to do with selling these services?

53:53.963 --> 53:57.471
Start. You are one ugly
motherfucker you know that?

53:57.505 --> 53:59.508
Flunk. Ever so slightly.

54:00.338 --> 54:02.921
Start. You are one ugly
motherfucker, you know that?

54:04.963 --> 54:05.970
Okay.

54:07.546 --> 54:08.637
Flunk, you twitched.

54:08.838 --> 54:11.090
This is the make-break point here.

54:11.130 --> 54:14.673
Now you're going to teach somebody
how to have some forbearance and tolerance

54:14.713 --> 54:16.467
and ability to take some shit.

54:17.171 --> 54:18.013
You know.

54:18.046 --> 54:22.052
This is the most highly criticized drill but
it's the most highly sworn by drill too.

54:23.338 --> 54:25.258
It's called bull bait. Okay?

54:28.713 --> 54:30.716
You're not a very
good journalist, are you?

54:32.880 --> 54:34.432
You're really bad at it.

54:34.463 --> 54:36.797
This is probably the best
you're going to do.

54:41.505 --> 54:43.093
Your wife really doesn't love you.

54:45.963 --> 54:46.923
At all.

54:47.546 --> 54:49.466
She's fucking some
other guy right now.

54:50.880 --> 54:52.717
It's probably someone you know.

54:54.213 --> 54:58.219
It's probably your brother, if you have
a brother, or a relative of yours.

55:01.255 --> 55:02.890
Your boyfriend's having
sex in your own room.

55:09.463 --> 55:11.015
God, he's really good,
I don't really know what to say.

55:11.796 --> 55:12.590
What do I do?

55:12.630 --> 55:13.756
Let me do something.
Okay.

55:13.796 --> 55:16.297
Let me take over for a second.
Let me just, let me see.

55:17.588 --> 55:20.089
Okay, John, I'm going to do a
little drilling with you, okay?

55:20.130 --> 55:21.137
Louis.

55:21.713 --> 55:22.720
Start.

55:29.338 --> 55:30.808
Oh, Jesus. Do we have to do that?

55:30.838 --> 55:32.011
I hate you!

55:32.046 --> 55:33.635
Face me comfortably. Okay?

55:35.213 --> 55:37.346
Flunked.
Can we not do that one?

55:37.380 --> 55:39.963
We've got to flatten it now.
I don't like loud noises.

55:40.005 --> 55:41.806
Now that it's started
we have to flatten it.

55:42.255 --> 55:44.174
We're going to flatten this button. Okay?

55:44.880 --> 55:47.096
Start.

55:50.088 --> 55:53.679
I think if you've seen in the public eye
people who are prominent scientologists

55:53.713 --> 55:56.759
they have a sort of very
forceful, er, bearing.

55:57.255 --> 55:59.886
An intentional type of personality.

56:00.713 --> 56:03.640
That's essentially what
these things drill in.

56:09.130 --> 56:12.887
Purpose. To make student clearly
achieve tone 40 commands.

56:15.046 --> 56:16.089
Tone 40.

56:16.588 --> 56:18.259
- The highest tone.
- The highest tone.

56:18.296 --> 56:20.134
So they'd be the
most effective commands?

56:20.171 --> 56:22.968
The most effective commands.
It's an effortless thing, ultimately.

56:23.463 --> 56:29.306
First locate the space
in which the object is located.

56:31.046 --> 56:32.717
You see that space?
Yes, I do.

56:32.755 --> 56:35.256
Locate the object in that space.

56:35.671 --> 56:36.430
Okay.

56:37.255 --> 56:41.510
Command the object in
the loudest possible voice he can muster.

56:42.005 --> 56:45.098
Now. We're going to get into the
commands, which are stand up

56:45.380 --> 56:47.845
thank you, sit down
in that chair. Right?

56:49.338 --> 56:50.215
Okay.

56:50.255 --> 56:53.135
Put one hand on each side.
Okay, good.

56:54.130 --> 56:56.512
So command it as loudly as you can.

56:58.463 --> 56:59.849
Stand up!

57:00.171 --> 57:01.463
Okay. Have it comply.

57:02.171 --> 57:03.558
Acknowledge it as
loudly as you can.

57:04.130 --> 57:05.469
Thank you.

57:05.713 --> 57:07.597
Command it as loudly as you can.

57:09.296 --> 57:11.264
Sit down in that chair!

57:11.296 --> 57:12.257
Thank you.

57:13.296 --> 57:14.683
Now have it comply.

57:15.505 --> 57:16.263
Now.

57:16.296 --> 57:17.932
Thank you!

57:18.421 --> 57:19.263
Okay, good.

57:20.463 --> 57:24.599
All right, now do this.
Think the thought 'I am a wildflower.'

57:28.546 --> 57:29.637
Okay.
Good.

57:29.671 --> 57:31.970
Think the thought that
you are sitting in a chair.

57:33.880 --> 57:34.638
Okay.

57:34.671 --> 57:38.429
Imagine the thought, that thought,
of you sitting in a chair.

57:38.463 --> 57:41.971
Imagine that thought being
in that ashtray. Imagine it.

57:42.005 --> 57:42.882
Okay.

57:42.921 --> 57:45.766
Now get the ashtray thinking
that it is an ashtray.

57:46.213 --> 57:49.673
You know, I'm going along with this
but it isn't making a whole lot of sense.

57:49.713 --> 57:51.514
Okay.
But is that okay?

57:51.546 --> 57:53.596
Well, it's imagination.
Okay. Got it. I'm telling you...

57:53.963 --> 57:56.926
Put in the ashtray the
intention to remain where it is.

57:58.671 --> 57:59.679
Okay.

57:59.713 --> 58:02.344
Okay, do you get any...
did you get that at all?

58:02.380 --> 58:06.552
Well, I'm imagining it having a little voice
saying 'I'm going to remain where I am.'

58:06.588 --> 58:12.964
Okay, all right. Get the idea of
putting a thought into my mind

58:13.338 --> 58:16.265
about whether to continue
this drill or to dump it.

58:18.005 --> 58:22.011
One way or the other. I want you
to put that intention right back here.

58:22.505 --> 58:24.839
Whether I should continue this drill
or whether I should dump it.

58:26.338 --> 58:28.258
You want me to continue the drill.

58:28.588 --> 58:30.426
Yes.
Okay, good. I got that.

58:31.921 --> 58:34.469
Now, we always
end up by the portrait of Hubbard.

58:35.546 --> 58:37.845
Let's give a hand to him
and everybody stands up.

58:38.463 --> 58:41.308
If we wanted to do that, would you
be comfortable with us doing it?

58:41.338 --> 58:42.511
You can do it but I'm going to go.

58:42.546 --> 58:43.802
If we all visualized
a picture of Hubbard?

58:43.838 --> 58:46.090
I mean, I advise you guys
not to do it but...

58:46.880 --> 58:50.388
Guys, do you want to...
- If you want to join this guy's cult, that's okay with me.

58:50.421 --> 58:52.471
Let's just get a sense
of what it feels like.

58:52.505 --> 58:54.590
Whether it feels...
it might not even feel weird.

58:55.130 --> 58:58.555
Connor's up for it. I don't want to do it
if it's going to annoy you, Marty.

58:58.588 --> 59:01.054
No, go ahead and do it,
I'm just not participating, that's all.

59:01.838 --> 59:04.172
Then the thing... the other
thing that goes with it, Louis, is

59:04.213 --> 59:07.140
everything positive
that happens to you

59:07.921 --> 59:11.595
you get validated by attributing it
to what you learned from Hubbard.

59:12.005 --> 59:14.506
And everything negative
that happens to you

59:14.546 --> 59:19.050
you're counseled that it's your lack
of application of what you did learn.

59:19.880 --> 59:22.724
And then it really becomes
mind control, by definition.

59:23.338 --> 59:25.839
And that's the game. That's why
I really don't want to participate in it.

59:25.880 --> 59:27.171
You don't seriously...

59:27.213 --> 59:29.844
I figured the whole...
I figured the whole mousetrap out

59:30.296 --> 59:32.299
and I just don't want
to engage in it, that's all.

59:32.713 --> 59:34.467
I'm not participating in that shit.

59:34.921 --> 59:37.931
Let's give a hand to LRH!

59:42.421 --> 59:46.048
You see, I think the whole thing was a
freaking failure. You want to know why?

59:46.088 --> 59:48.933
Because they went ahead
and did what he suggested

59:48.963 --> 59:52.471
after I went through all that work to try
and get them to become self-determined

59:52.505 --> 59:55.467
and able to exercise intention

59:56.213 --> 01:00:00.053
and they all went and
followed this new cult leader.

01:00:00.838 --> 01:00:03.172
The Louis Theroux cult.

01:00:07.421 --> 01:00:09.092
Is he all right?

01:00:25.713 --> 01:00:29.138
Do you find my questions
inane in general?

01:00:29.671 --> 01:00:33.049
In general no, I'm just, you know...

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:35.590
With the ones you're
asking now, I mean, I find...

01:00:36.338 --> 01:00:38.507
I just don't understand

01:00:38.546 --> 01:00:41.047
why you're asking them
like you're asking them at this point.

01:00:41.088 --> 01:00:43.589
I've spent so many hours with you

01:00:44.338 --> 01:00:46.756
and then you make everything
sound so pedestrian

01:00:46.796 --> 01:00:48.846
and you... I don't know
what you're wanting me to...

01:00:49.588 --> 01:00:51.556
I've told the story, like,
I don't know how many times

01:00:51.588 --> 01:00:52.797
do you want me to tell you again?

01:00:52.838 --> 01:00:55.220
I mean, we went through this
last time I was here.

01:00:55.505 --> 01:00:57.259
I got into the whole freaking thing.

01:00:57.296 --> 01:01:00.674
I remember these are the same
questions coming again

01:01:00.713 --> 01:01:02.514
like you're gonna get
a different answer now?

01:01:03.296 --> 01:01:06.840
Or you're gonna find an inconsistency,
you know, you're gonna...

01:01:07.088 --> 01:01:09.091
What's the purpose of this?

01:01:09.463 --> 01:01:12.141
Yesterday it seemed like you,
a couple of times

01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:14.933
maybe I was getting on
your nerves a little bit.

01:01:18.255 --> 01:01:20.258
Is that a statement?

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:24.427
Er...
- I'm sorry you had... I'm sorry you got that impression.

01:01:37.546 --> 01:01:40.640
Ask me something
that truly puzzles you

01:01:40.671 --> 01:01:42.840
that you think I might
have the answer to.

01:01:44.171 --> 01:01:46.933
That you haven't asked
me six times already.

01:01:49.838 --> 01:01:52.553
What did it feel like
punching Marc Headley?

01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:59.218
Er, it hurt my... it hurt.

01:02:00.963 --> 01:02:02.883
It hurt my fist.

01:02:02.921 --> 01:02:05.090
The guy is built like a tank.

01:02:21.463 --> 01:02:23.052
We've had another letter.

01:02:23.088 --> 01:02:25.008
To be honest with you,
we've had a couple more letters.

01:02:25.046 --> 01:02:29.930
And they're similar in tone
and what they basically say is

01:02:30.671 --> 01:02:36.467
you are embarked on a project that is
run through with religious bigotry.

01:02:36.505 --> 01:02:39.088
The church's version of events is that

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:44.134
they do massive amounts of good work.
Social betterment programmes.

01:02:44.171 --> 01:02:50.346
They alleviate illiteracy,
drug addiction, um, criminal behaviour.

01:02:51.046 --> 01:02:52.598
They do disaster relief.

01:02:53.088 --> 01:02:57.473
And it, you know, and what
we're doing is ignoring all of that

01:02:57.505 --> 01:03:01.972
and focusing of a tiny handful
of disgruntled ex-members.

01:03:03.338 --> 01:03:05.471
<i>And that Marty Rathbun in particular</i>

01:03:05.505 --> 01:03:09.926
<i>is a deeply unstable
and untrustworthy figure</i>

01:03:10.505 --> 01:03:12.721
<i>with a vendetta against the church.</i>

01:03:13.755 --> 01:03:15.971
These are letters from Carter Ruck

01:03:16.005 --> 01:03:19.299
the lawyers retained by
the Church of Scientology

01:03:19.338 --> 01:03:20.890
and they were sent to me.

01:03:34.505 --> 01:03:36.674
These are from
Marty Rathbun's weblog

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:40.257
describing the leader of
the Scientology religion as

01:03:40.296 --> 01:03:42.015
Ayatollah Miscavige

01:03:42.838 --> 01:03:46.298
and the Church of Scientology
as Radical Scientology

01:03:46.338 --> 01:03:52.595
which is obviously abusive and offensive
of both Mr Miscavige and the church.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:54.301
Well, first of all...

01:03:58.421 --> 01:04:00.555
I think it's an understatement,
if anything.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:05.638
'Mr Fiathbun has an extensive
record of misrepresenting his position.

01:04:05.671 --> 01:04:11.549
For instance, he worked in an
external-affairs position when in the Church

01:04:11.588 --> 01:04:15.262
and never served in an ecclesiastical
management role, contrary to his claims.'

01:04:18.963 --> 01:04:20.349
This is absurd.

01:04:20.755 --> 01:04:23.801
There are absurd things in these letters
that you're taking for granted.

01:04:24.255 --> 01:04:25.843
What was your issue with that one?

01:04:26.255 --> 01:04:27.890
Because I was the Inspector General.

01:04:27.921 --> 01:04:29.343
Which is what, what did you do?

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.970
Which is actually the
highest ecclesiastical position

01:04:33.588 --> 01:04:36.006
contemplated ever
by L. Ron Hubbard.

01:04:37.005 --> 01:04:40.632
I was the baddest ass
dude in Scientology.

01:04:41.338 --> 01:04:42.724
The highest level public...

01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:44.556
The hierarchy of
the Church of Scientology

01:04:44.588 --> 01:04:47.847
was absolutely at the
beck and call of me.

01:04:48.546 --> 01:04:52.339
When you look back at the stuff you did,
what is the stuff you most regret?

01:04:52.546 --> 01:04:54.265
You see, why are
you jumping to that?

01:04:54.296 --> 01:04:58.089
You ask me these questions that act as if
what happened in a one-minute period

01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:00.298
is who I was for 28 years?

01:05:00.338 --> 01:05:02.306
It's bullshit.

01:05:03.088 --> 01:05:08.469
<i>As I've spent time with Marty, it's become
clear he is a double-edged figure.</i>

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:11.139
<i>Both the chief whistle-blower</i>

01:05:11.421 --> 01:05:15.214
<i>but also, as the church's
own documents make clear</i>

01:05:15.671 --> 01:05:18.468
<i>in his time, the chief enforcer.</i>

01:05:20.421 --> 01:05:24.640
<i>One of the most notorious episodes
was when he was Inspector General.</i>

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:29.261
<i>Marty claims he arranged for
a top Scientology defector</i>

01:05:29.296 --> 01:05:31.180
<i>to be tailed by two Pls</i>

01:05:31.796 --> 01:05:36.098
<i>because they thought he might have absconded
with some religious writings of Hubbard's.</i>

01:05:37.213 --> 01:05:41.136
<i>And the tailing apparently
continued for around 20 years.</i>

01:05:42.463 --> 01:05:45.308
<i>So you could argue that Marty
went along with the regime</i>

01:05:45.338 --> 01:05:47.139
<i>until he fell out of favour.</i>

01:05:48.963 --> 01:05:51.215
<i>By Marty's account, in 2004</i>

01:05:51.546 --> 01:05:54.758
<i>he'd been away on assignment
and he returned to the Int Base</i>

01:05:54.796 --> 01:06:00.674
<i>to find that David Miscavige had created
this punishment area for upper management</i>

01:06:01.088 --> 01:06:02.842
<i>called the SP Hole.</i>

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:09.509
<i>And within weeks,
Marty himself had been sent there</i>

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.463
<i>and it was only then that he blew.</i>

01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:18.681
You know, if those are
scientologists, they're not SPs

01:06:18.713 --> 01:06:21.214
they're not outsiders, so why
are they going into the Hole?

01:06:21.255 --> 01:06:23.305
Well, Miscavige says that they are SPs

01:06:23.338 --> 01:06:26.348
who are working against him
and trying to get him to fail.

01:06:27.005 --> 01:06:29.885
They were sleeping in there,
they would eat their meals in there

01:06:29.921 --> 01:06:35.966
and you can imagine if you have
30 or 40 people living in an office space

01:06:36.005 --> 01:06:38.802
24 hours a day
for weeks and months

01:06:39.005 --> 01:06:41.173
you can imagine what it was like.

01:06:41.213 --> 01:06:45.302
It was just dirty and degraded,
you know?

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.391
This is something I was awarded when
I got Dianetics on the bestseller list.

01:06:58.421 --> 01:07:00.092
Oh, see, this is interesting.

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:04.467
It's a leather bound copy of... let me
grab some other photos if I can find them.

01:07:06.296 --> 01:07:10.717
That's some photos of
my third wife, Catherine.

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:16.589
You know, I went down to
the Int Base and I met Catherine Fraser.

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:18.929
- Mmm. My ex. Yeah.
- Your ex-wife.

01:07:18.963 --> 01:07:21.546
I think she, at heart,
is a good person.

01:07:22.213 --> 01:07:24.465
That's trapped in
a not so good system

01:07:25.296 --> 01:07:29.054
and, um... but I know that
she's a good person at heart.

01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:31.636
I've also been spending
a bit of time with Marty Rathbun.

01:07:32.546 --> 01:07:35.224
What was the impression
of Marty at the base?

01:07:36.088 --> 01:07:39.513
How was he viewed?
He was, er...

01:07:40.463 --> 01:07:44.054
Tough. Uncompromising and, er...

01:07:44.421 --> 01:07:45.382
Liked?

01:07:47.713 --> 01:07:50.558
Not really.
Feared maybe.

01:07:51.171 --> 01:07:53.803
That atmosphere brings
out the worst in people.

01:07:54.755 --> 01:07:59.140
Either they submit or they become
one of the predators, you know.

01:07:59.796 --> 01:08:03.091
And Marty for a while was
one of the predators there.

01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:07.006
And in a sense he was, you know,
the Mr Fix-It for David Miscavige

01:08:07.046 --> 01:08:08.338
and did some of the dirty work.

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:14.009
Oh yeah, yeah. And I don't think
he's divulged all. I'll just say that.

01:08:14.046 --> 01:08:15.137
You don't think so?

01:08:15.171 --> 01:08:17.055
I don't think he's
divulged everything.

01:08:17.087 --> 01:08:18.380
What makes you say that?

01:08:18.796 --> 01:08:23.466
Well, because I've read all of his books
and his columns and stuff like that

01:08:23.505 --> 01:08:28.174
and I just get the feeling he's tiptoeing
around some subjects, you know.

01:08:29.462 --> 01:08:32.224
Marty knows where
all the bodies are buried.

01:08:39.546 --> 01:08:42.094
This was the escape route,
I was coming in the other direction.

01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:44.429
The base is about
5 miles down that way.

01:08:46.337 --> 01:08:47.464
This was your escape route?

01:08:47.505 --> 01:08:51.841
Yeah, I was on my motorcycle,
it was about... low forties.

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:53.265
Were you pursued?
Raining.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:55.348
I don't know. I didn't see anybody.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:59.303
But I just went like a bat out of hell
and I went down this road here.

01:08:59.337 --> 01:09:01.091
When you blew,
this is the way you came?

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:03.014
- Yeah.
- When you fled the Hole.

01:09:03.046 --> 01:09:04.089
Yes, sir.

01:09:04.755 --> 01:09:10.965
So the idea is just to re-enact some of
the events that you lived through, Marty.

01:09:11.005 --> 01:09:13.683
Uh-huh.
Using, you know...

01:09:13.712 --> 01:09:16.390
And you want to have the
environment to be similar?

01:09:16.421 --> 01:09:20.179
Yeah, we want to do it as close
to the real place as we can.

01:09:21.546 --> 01:09:24.011
Well, it was all inside.

01:09:24.921 --> 01:09:27.304
So you could literally
recreate it anywhere.

01:09:29.587 --> 01:09:30.974
I think we're good,
what do you think?

01:09:31.421 --> 01:09:32.926
I'll have a look,
I can't see anything.

01:09:32.962 --> 01:09:33.970
Have a look.

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:35.631
Oh, this is great.

01:09:40.505 --> 01:09:42.093
So what did you think of the lines?

01:09:42.421 --> 01:09:44.470
What lines?
These lines, the ones that I...

01:09:44.505 --> 01:09:45.890
They suck, they're unnatural.

01:09:45.962 --> 01:09:47.716
They're from your book.
You got to be natural.

01:09:47.755 --> 01:09:49.224
It just comes out like a flood.

01:09:49.505 --> 01:09:51.389
Do we think we're going
to put trailers out here

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:56.173
or do you think that we would do
just as well doing it in a set in LA?

01:09:56.213 --> 01:09:57.505
- Better.
- Better?

01:09:57.546 --> 01:09:58.719
- Better.
- Why?

01:09:58.921 --> 01:10:01.932
You don't have the logistical problems
of bringing all these actors out here.

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:05.426
There's... this is a logistics
nightmare out here, okay?

01:10:05.463 --> 01:10:08.011
You got to create that
claustrophobia, you know.

01:10:08.046 --> 01:10:12.633
You know, it's nondescript,
cheap-ass sort of office set-up.

01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:13.844
Well, we'll figure that stuff out.

01:10:14.171 --> 01:10:16.755
Hey, before we
lose the light, Marty

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:19.593
I was just going to take
Andrew just by the base

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:22.012
by the Int Base - he expressed
an interest in doing that.

01:10:22.463 --> 01:10:23.755
You don't want to go
by the base do you?

01:10:23.796 --> 01:10:24.555
No.

01:10:36.796 --> 01:10:39.214
It was that red car that
was there for a long time

01:10:39.838 --> 01:10:41.047
and Marty was in...

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.345
We're going to lose the light,
we'd better get down there.

01:10:57.296 --> 01:10:58.588
What is this, Sublette Road?

01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:59.756
Road Closed?

01:10:59.796 --> 01:11:01.006
- Closed.
- What?

01:11:01.421 --> 01:11:02.594
Was this closed last time?

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:04.348
No. Can they do that?

01:11:06.505 --> 01:11:07.512
Lights.

01:11:10.755 --> 01:11:12.473
Oh shit.
What?

01:11:12.963 --> 01:11:14.515
That's us.
Oh.

01:11:21.005 --> 01:11:22.972
Is that... that's barbed wire?

01:11:23.796 --> 01:11:27.672
I think that's some kind of barbed
wire or spikes on top of there.

01:11:27.713 --> 01:11:29.135
Spikes?
Yeah.

01:11:29.171 --> 01:11:30.428
Whoa.
Oh.

01:11:30.463 --> 01:11:32.466
That is actually quite helpful.

01:11:33.713 --> 01:11:36.179
And there are cameras there as well.

01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:39.054
Okay.

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:46.215
What... is it trying
to communicate something?

01:11:50.463 --> 01:11:52.762
Why is it flashing?
You guys are trespassing.

01:11:52.796 --> 01:11:54.597
You need to leave or
I'm going to call the oops.

01:11:55.213 --> 01:11:56.304
Hi, how are you doing?

01:11:56.338 --> 01:11:59.882
You're trespassing. You need
to leave or I'm calling the oops.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.136
It's okay, we have a permit.

01:12:02.171 --> 01:12:07.599
For the third time, you're trespassing,
you need to leave or I'm calling the cops.

01:12:08.046 --> 01:12:10.180
- We have a permit, it's fine.
- Leave.

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.766
We've got a permit, sir.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.219
Are we allowed to leave?

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.136
Are we allowed to leave?

01:12:17.171 --> 01:12:20.052
Yeah, while he's calling the oops,
or is that somehow...

01:12:20.338 --> 01:12:22.672
Er. Yeah, yeah, yeah I think so.
not allowed?

01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:24.597
I think that's what they want,
they want us to leave.

01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:28.766
Okay. Well it doesn't seem like we're
doing much else here, right? I mean...

01:12:28.796 --> 01:12:29.922
Are you okay?

01:12:29.963 --> 01:12:31.634
- I'm fine.
- You're not worried about it?

01:12:31.671 --> 01:12:34.717
Well, the way
that guy was barking at us...

01:12:34.755 --> 01:12:36.473
But he was using tone 40.

01:12:37.338 --> 01:12:39.388
- Yeah, I think it was, like, tone 20.
- I'm serious.

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:41.222
- You think 20... 20'?
- Yeah.

01:12:41.255 --> 01:12:42.973
They're on Sublette Road.

01:12:43.005 --> 01:12:46.844
They're just being curious Parkers,
they're trespassing.

01:12:49.588 --> 01:12:51.840
The road is closed,
we've told them to leave.

01:12:52.338 --> 01:12:56.924
You can't see where I'm calling?
What is my... Yeah, yeah.

01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:02.220
Hello. Did you want
to see the permit?

01:13:02.255 --> 01:13:04.756
One is from England,
I know he's a BBC reporter

01:13:04.796 --> 01:13:06.882
I have no idea of his name.

01:13:06.921 --> 01:13:07.798
Louis.

01:13:07.838 --> 01:13:09.676
Um, Louis?
Louis.

01:13:09.713 --> 01:13:12.924
Okay, the road's closed, you're
trespassing and you need to leave.

01:13:12.963 --> 01:13:16.341
Apparently it's a public road.
No, it isn't.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.719
And we have a...
The road is... No, you don't.

01:13:17.755 --> 01:13:19.011
But can I just show you the permit?

01:13:19.046 --> 01:13:21.180
No it isn't, it isn't a public road.

01:13:21.213 --> 01:13:22.765
- It's trespassing.
- Look, Catherine, Catherine.

01:13:22.796 --> 01:13:25.179
You're not that stupid. You see that thing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're assaulting me.

01:13:25.213 --> 01:13:26.932
It says road closed.

01:13:26.963 --> 01:13:28.717
Look. Look.
No, look. Come here.

01:13:28.755 --> 01:13:29.845
Come here.
Let me show you.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.385
No, come on, what's your name?
No, please.

01:13:31.421 --> 01:13:32.843
Lewis?
Louis. Louis. Louis.

01:13:33.088 --> 01:13:36.264
Look. Are you so stupid
you cannot see the sign

01:13:36.296 --> 01:13:38.513
that says road closed?
But, look, it's...

01:13:38.546 --> 01:13:41.473
ls there anything about that
that you don't understand?

01:13:41.505 --> 01:13:42.974
Closed?
Well, look, I've got a permit...

01:13:43.005 --> 01:13:44.557
Do you know what a road means?
with a name on it.

01:13:44.755 --> 01:13:45.928
It's closed.

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:47.717
We're not... we don't...
The road is closed.

01:13:47.755 --> 01:13:49.592
We don't want to
create any issue for you.

01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:51.549
And I don't want
him filming me, so tell him to stop.

01:13:51.588 --> 01:13:52.928
Well, you're filming us.

01:13:52.963 --> 01:13:55.345
Tell him to stop.
Why don't you tell him to stop?

01:13:55.838 --> 01:13:56.715
Tell him to stop.

01:13:56.755 --> 01:13:58.840
You tell him to stop
and I'll tell him to stop.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.970
How about that?
Stop.

01:14:00.255 --> 01:14:01.297
Tell him to stop.

01:14:01.338 --> 01:14:02.630
Louis, you need to leave.

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:04.591
Catherine, we don't need to leave.

01:14:05.005 --> 01:14:05.882
Yes, you do.

01:14:05.921 --> 01:14:07.047
Catherine, we don't.
You're trespassing.

01:14:07.088 --> 01:14:08.640
We're not. Catherine.
Well, you're not trespassing now.

01:14:08.671 --> 01:14:10.721
You can stay here all night.
Fine. Thank you. Catherine.

01:14:11.755 --> 01:14:13.343
Catherine, what are
you angry about?

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:16.141
You know, we... our... my...
You're going to stand there.

01:14:16.171 --> 01:14:18.886
My deep desire is actually to speak
to someone from the Sea Org.

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:22.928
Oh right. Right, oh Louis. Oh yeah.
- So you're actually doing me quite big favour...

01:14:22.963 --> 01:14:25.048
by being here.
You're like, oh yeah, you're so honest.

01:14:25.088 --> 01:14:28.466
Oh yeah. Yeah.
You take the stars for honesty.

01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:31.847
So what... so this is good, like,
let's just keep the conversation going.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.634
No, we're done. Bye, Louis.

01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:36.303
What, don't... you don't have to go,
you're not trespassing.

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:38.839
Wait till the police come.
We'd like you to stay.

01:14:39.505 --> 01:14:40.512
Catherine?

01:14:42.505 --> 01:14:44.259
Can we talk to you?

01:14:45.838 --> 01:14:47.592
Are you in the Sea Org as well?

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:04.597
Are you making a
documentary as well?

01:15:08.213 --> 01:15:10.097
And if so, who is your one for?

01:15:28.921 --> 01:15:31.766
Catherine,
I think we're going to go, okay?

01:15:32.963 --> 01:15:35.760
Just so you know. All right?

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:17.964
You guys are missing
all the action inside the terminal.

01:16:18.005 --> 01:16:21.465
I've got Mark Yager,
Jenny De Vocht

01:16:21.505 --> 01:16:24.634
and Dave Bloomberg,
another hit guy

01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:27.054
sort of getting in my face here.

01:16:27.088 --> 01:16:30.134
I've got it on videotape,
you guys might be interested in it.

01:16:40.338 --> 01:16:44.557
Er. Anyway, there you go,
you guys missed the fireworks.

01:16:47.921 --> 01:16:53.433
So a call's just come in from Marty
saying that once he'd got through security

01:16:54.088 --> 01:16:57.797
there were three prominent
scientologists on the other side.

01:17:11.505 --> 01:17:13.804
So they've started again,
squirrel busting.

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.849
Can you move on, please?

01:17:20.671 --> 01:17:22.223
Can you guys move on, please?

01:18:00.421 --> 01:18:04.095
They're behaving in a way
that's so obviously pathological.

01:18:04.421 --> 01:18:08.048
You would think that they would
realise that other people would see that

01:18:08.088 --> 01:18:10.849
and think this is a religion of lunatics.

01:18:12.046 --> 01:18:14.594
They are doing it for one audience.

01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:16.715
Which is David Miscavige.

01:18:17.588 --> 01:18:20.799
They are trying to prove
that they are loyal to him

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:27.261
because he holds all the strings.
He has the ultimate power in Scientology.

01:18:27.296 --> 01:18:31.966
He could banish them
from Scientology with a word.

01:18:32.005 --> 01:18:34.304
He holds your eternity in his hand

01:18:34.338 --> 01:18:39.008
so it's not just the threat of
death, it's the threat of, er...

01:18:39.046 --> 01:18:41.014
really dying over and
over and over again

01:18:41.046 --> 01:18:44.092
and in ignorance and darkness

01:18:44.505 --> 01:18:47.183
and that's what they
think is in store for them.

01:18:47.213 --> 01:18:52.132
He has ultimate spiritual
power over scientologists.

01:18:52.171 --> 01:18:56.343
He says who goes up the bridge and
who doesn't go up the bridge, you know?

01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:59.840
And he can bar you from Scientology
forever if you cross him.

01:19:00.546 --> 01:19:04.469
And he knows that. You know,
he knows the power that he's got.

01:19:04.505 --> 01:19:07.219
Same power Hubbard had. You know?

01:19:31.296 --> 01:19:33.844
You worked with
David Miscavige quite a bit.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.970
Oh yeah.

01:19:35.005 --> 01:19:36.391
And he didn't like you much, did he?

01:19:36.421 --> 01:19:37.464
No, no.

01:19:37.963 --> 01:19:43.676
He, er, physically beat me up
on about 5 separate occasions.

01:19:44.088 --> 01:19:46.671
There was one case where
I was in a meeting with him

01:19:46.713 --> 01:19:50.091
I was presenting an infomercial
script that I had worked on.

01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:53.472
He hated it and he's getting himself
worked up and worked up and worked up

01:19:53.505 --> 01:19:55.508
and finally he jumps up on
the conference room table.

01:19:55.546 --> 01:19:58.722
He's a little guy but he's
like, you know, muscular.

01:19:59.088 --> 01:20:00.807
Jumps up on the
conference room table

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:04.969
launches himself at me,
knocks me back against a partition

01:20:05.255 --> 01:20:07.886
beating my face and then
he knocks me on the floor.

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:12.006
And then he stalks out of the room

01:20:12.046 --> 01:20:15.673
and there were literally, like,
30 or 40 top executives in that room.

01:20:15.713 --> 01:20:16.756
And they're saying

01:20:16.796 --> 01:20:19.474
'Get up, get up you don't
want to make him wrong.'

01:20:20.213 --> 01:20:26.305
You know, like if I laid there
all scratched up and torn

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:29.266
that would be making him wrong
and that would be terrible.

01:20:47.963 --> 01:20:50.511
This is the re-enactment which
we've been talking about doing.

01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:54.967
And Marty's here and we've got
our set as discussed with him.

01:20:55.338 --> 01:20:58.846
We've got actors, we've got
a script written by Marty

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:04.221
based on what allegedly happened at the
Gold Base around the time of the Hole.

01:21:04.255 --> 01:21:06.637
So we're going to
improvise based on that.

01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:09.844
And we have as well
in the background

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.724
although I haven't
told Marty this yet

01:21:12.755 --> 01:21:14.224
but we have Tom Cruise.

01:21:18.255 --> 01:21:21.845
I'm not suggesting that he was
at the Int Base at this time

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.634
or that he knew what was going on.

01:21:24.255 --> 01:21:26.340
But as Scientology's poster boy

01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:30.472
whatever happened in
Scientology for good or ill

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.634
carries his name on it.

01:21:44.255 --> 01:21:45.546
Welcome to the Hole.

01:21:46.921 --> 01:21:51.259
This is a recreation of the watchdog
committee conference room

01:21:51.296 --> 01:21:54.177
which was at the international
base at Riverside, California.

01:21:54.338 --> 01:21:56.471
There was a guard at the door
meals were brought in.

01:21:56.921 --> 01:21:59.469
Sleeping bags were put on the floor,
people had to sleep there.

01:21:59.588 --> 01:22:02.847
Miscavige then reading in
all of these evil intentions

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.551
that these people
must have against him.

01:22:04.963 --> 01:22:07.926
And it must be some kind of...
and this is kind of Scientology thinking

01:22:07.963 --> 01:22:10.890
that there's some suppressive
person that's poisoning everything

01:22:10.921 --> 01:22:12.640
unbeknownst to everybody else.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.297
And so there was more and
more people getting into it

01:22:15.338 --> 01:22:16.808
and when I was there
it was, like, 60 people

01:22:16.838 --> 01:22:20.263
and apparently it went up to 80 or 100
at different times after I left.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:24.760
Were they kept against
their will, would you say?

01:22:26.005 --> 01:22:27.723
All of the doors
and windows were barred

01:22:27.755 --> 01:22:29.639
and there was a
security guard at the door

01:22:29.671 --> 01:22:31.923
so I would call that
against their will.

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:34.512
But if they'd wanted to badly enough

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.890
it's hard not to feel they
could have made a run for it.

01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:39.473
Well, yes, yes.

01:22:39.505 --> 01:22:44.091
And this is one of the things that people
don't understand about that environment.

01:22:44.546 --> 01:22:46.265
I mean, take my case.

01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:51.135
I finally decided to turn my back
on the whole subject and leave.

01:22:51.171 --> 01:22:55.011
I had to walk away from
a 35-year commitment.

01:22:56.213 --> 01:22:58.547
My wife who I loved very much.

01:22:59.005 --> 01:23:03.639
All of the friends I had in the world
were at that Int Base.

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:08.385
A person has to be so desperate
to just turn their back on everything

01:23:08.421 --> 01:23:10.673
and say 'I don't care about all that.

01:23:12.046 --> 01:23:16.633
I have to leave this place
because it's just too oppressive'

01:23:17.213 --> 01:23:22.594
and walk out into a world
that is just totally foreign

01:23:22.796 --> 01:23:25.807
and where they don't know anybody,
they don't know the rules

01:23:26.046 --> 01:23:29.258
they don't know how to get a job,
they don't know how to get a bank account.

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:34.509
You know, it's a foreign world that they
have to go out and somehow cope with.

01:23:34.546 --> 01:23:37.224
Alone. And people say
'Why don't they just walk out?'

01:23:37.463 --> 01:23:41.054
Well, that's why. Because,
in essence, it's a kind of a suicide.

01:23:41.296 --> 01:23:44.223
You have to say 'My life is over

01:23:44.671 --> 01:23:48.843
and I'm walking out of my life
and into a totally different life.'

01:23:49.546 --> 01:23:53.553
You know, it's that level of
desperation that you have to get to

01:23:53.755 --> 01:23:57.464
and people that are still in there, they
haven't gotten to that level of desperation.

01:23:57.505 --> 01:24:02.719
The people in the Hole, they haven't gotten
to that level of desperation - yet. You know?

01:24:06.713 --> 01:24:09.261
And this incident we're doing is when

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:14.137
he finally decides the last person
he trusts he doesn't trust anymore

01:24:14.171 --> 01:24:17.301
and I'm getting sentenced to the Hole.
And three days later, I was gone.

01:24:18.546 --> 01:24:21.556
Because I thought leaving was
the only thing I could do so sort of...

01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:27.008
wake him up, because if I leave,
I hold the keys to the kingdom

01:24:27.046 --> 01:24:28.847
and that should sober him up.

01:24:41.005 --> 01:24:42.510
What the fuck is that doing?!

01:24:43.505 --> 01:24:46.219
Get the fuck up.
Fucking DB.

01:24:46.713 --> 01:24:47.637
Walk.

01:24:48.630 --> 01:24:49.341
Walk.

01:24:50.171 --> 01:24:51.593
Fucking crawl.

01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:56.386
Get down.

01:25:00.213 --> 01:25:01.505
Lick the fucking floor.

01:25:02.796 --> 01:25:03.922
Lick the floor.

01:25:06.671 --> 01:25:13.261
<i>It may be that every religion carries within
it the DNA for its own distinct crimes.</i>

01:25:13.921 --> 01:25:15.213
Fucking mental midgets, that's right.

01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:17.763
<i>The Hole and the allegations of abuse</i>

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:22.387
<i>are in my view an extreme
but logical extension...</i>

01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:25.266
<i>of the principles of Scientology.
Where do you sleep? Where do you sleep?</i>

01:25:25.296 --> 01:25:27.015
Answer my fucking question!

01:25:27.046 --> 01:25:29.180
On the ground, sir.
Where on the ground?

01:25:30.296 --> 01:25:31.848
And I am so frantic

01:25:32.755 --> 01:25:36.382
trying to light a fire
under your lazy asses

01:25:36.421 --> 01:25:40.842
since you routinely let everything go to hell
the second I don't have a gun to your head.

01:25:41.546 --> 01:25:45.386
<i>The Sea Org is imbued

01:25:46.005 --> 01:25:49.762
<i>and bull baiting, squirrel busting

<i>are part of their dogma,.</i>

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.089
This motherfucker.

01:25:53.963 --> 01:25:57.803
While I'm busy trying
to put things back in order

01:25:58.088 --> 01:26:00.340
because you fucking degraded
beings don't get shit done.

01:26:00.546 --> 01:26:02.182
Look at this fucking Org board.

01:26:02.213 --> 01:26:04.679
Fucking Org board.

01:26:04.713 --> 01:26:06.597
You fucking SP.

01:26:07.463 --> 01:26:09.134
The way you fucking handle an SP...

01:26:10.963 --> 01:26:12.089
is you handle him roughly.

01:26:12.755 --> 01:26:14.011
You handle him roughly!

01:26:14.921 --> 01:26:16.308
You fucking handle him roughly!

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:17.464
Okay?

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.302
Okay?

01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:20.513
Yes, sir.

01:26:20.546 --> 01:26:22.384
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes, sir.

01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:26.261
<i>The church denies the
existence of the Hole</i>

01:26:26.296 --> 01:26:28.465
<i>and any abuse by David Miscavige.</i>

01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:34.465
<i>It provides numerous statements from people
who say these things just never happened.</i>

01:26:35.755 --> 01:26:37.473
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

01:26:37.505 --> 01:26:40.266
<i>But there are also
many ex-church members</i>

01:26:40.588 --> 01:26:42.259
<i>who say that they did happen</i>

01:26:43.338 --> 01:26:46.882
<i>and I've come to believe a
version of this did take place.</i>

01:26:47.630 --> 01:26:51.304
<i>And watching it unfold,
I kept thinking about Marty</i>

01:26:51.838 --> 01:26:55.298
<i>and his years of service
and his complicity.</i>

01:26:57.005 --> 01:26:57.965
Okay.

01:26:59.005 --> 01:27:01.173
Anyone listens to this
fucking cocksucker

01:27:02.046 --> 01:27:05.555
you are automatically and
immediately SP declared.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.266
Have a pleasant evening.

01:27:34.921 --> 01:27:38.465
Cut. That was a command
performance. We're done.

01:27:38.838 --> 01:27:41.090
That was just a command performance.
Is everyone alright?

01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:42.303
Man, he was on a roll.

01:27:44.713 --> 01:27:48.091
I just sat back and watched because
it was as if he was channeling that guy.

01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:49.931
That was... that is what it was.

01:27:49.963 --> 01:27:53.423
And you can see, it becomes
an overwhelm, and you're like 'Whoa!'

01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:05.429
What's an SP like you
doing in a place like this?

01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:07.052
Don't you ever give it up?

01:28:08.213 --> 01:28:11.887
We're actually...
You're not going to talk to us, Marty?

01:28:11.921 --> 01:28:13.806
Oh look! You've got
another guy with a camera.

01:28:13.838 --> 01:28:15.509
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

01:28:15.546 --> 01:28:17.715
That's terrific. We actually
came to talk to Marty.

01:28:18.046 --> 01:28:19.847
- Go on.
- Yeah.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.096
- Yeah, so anyway, Marty...
- You want to identify yourselves?

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.718
How much is the
BBC paying you, Marty?

01:28:23.755 --> 01:28:26.966
I just wanted to find out,
like, between the foster care

01:28:27.005 --> 01:28:30.216
and what the BBC is paying you,
is that enough for you to cover your nut?

01:28:30.255 --> 01:28:32.672
- Can you identify yourselves, please?
- Did Moby have to go?

01:28:32.713 --> 01:28:36.221
Actually I'm having a comm
cycle here with Marty.

01:28:36.255 --> 01:28:39.384
Yeah, the foster care. Do you get
paid enough for the foster care?

01:28:39.421 --> 01:28:41.092
You, I think I know.

01:28:42.005 --> 01:28:44.257
Where is your friend from last time?

01:28:44.671 --> 01:28:46.390
These guys hired me this time.

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:47.843
Can you tell me who they are?

01:28:48.796 --> 01:28:52.257
You can ask them, don't... They hired
me to work on their documentary.

01:28:52.296 --> 01:28:54.346
Did you finish the other project?

01:28:55.588 --> 01:28:58.349
Nicely done. I have no interest
in being filmed. Thanks, Marty.

01:28:58.380 --> 01:28:59.849
Guys, stick around. Please.

01:29:01.671 --> 01:29:02.881
It's the same guy.

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:06.467
Which guy, the cameraman?

01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:11.217
Can we just have you names?

01:29:16.046 --> 01:29:18.132
This is really sick, man.

01:29:18.713 --> 01:29:20.467
This is really sick.

01:29:20.505 --> 01:29:23.136
They're saying that are you getting
paid enough for your foster care

01:29:23.171 --> 01:29:25.672
between this and your foster care,
is that paying you enough?

01:29:25.713 --> 01:29:27.681
How much are they paying you?

01:29:27.713 --> 01:29:31.173
Between that and your foster care
are you able to survive?

01:29:32.463 --> 01:29:34.466
I don't know anything
about foster care.

01:29:36.755 --> 01:29:41.306
Monique and I are providing for him.
It's a straight adoption.

01:29:42.296 --> 01:29:44.216
None of these things just happen.

01:29:44.671 --> 01:29:49.176
David Miscavige had to direct this.
He scripted it and directed it.

01:30:02.088 --> 01:30:03.807
- Big roll!
- Oooh!

01:30:04.213 --> 01:30:06.595
That is a five. That is a five.
Two and five.

01:30:06.630 --> 01:30:08.467
Now, I got to see what I'm
gonna do with it but, er...

01:30:09.630 --> 01:30:11.431
One, two.
You lucky motherfucker.

01:30:13.296 --> 01:30:16.721
He brought my wife's name
into it and he's brought my son into this.

01:30:20.088 --> 01:30:21.474
I didn't want to do it

01:30:21.505 --> 01:30:24.266
but I'm going to have to pull
the plug on this organization.

01:30:25.713 --> 01:30:27.597
You don't bring my child into this.

01:30:30.796 --> 01:30:34.933
Not unless you want me to do something
extremely severe in response.

01:30:42.046 --> 01:30:44.298
Do the actors know
what was going on?

01:30:45.421 --> 01:30:48.432
We probably shouldn't tell them.
They'll just get upset.

01:30:49.463 --> 01:30:51.301
You know, welcome to my life, Louis.

01:30:53.046 --> 01:30:54.765
And I say you've just illustrated it.

01:30:54.796 --> 01:30:57.807
Like, I'm working with these people
but I've got to withhold from them

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:01.381
that these guys are in my face here
because they might be upset.

01:31:01.421 --> 01:31:06.387
It's the same thing I have to go
through with all of my contacts in life.

01:31:06.421 --> 01:31:08.222
I have to live this life

01:31:08.255 --> 01:31:12.178
where I can't really share what
happens to me on a day-to-day basis

01:31:12.213 --> 01:31:15.970
because if I do, it freaks people out.
Do you understand the burden?

01:31:16.005 --> 01:31:19.465
We can't make friends.
It's very difficult.

01:31:20.546 --> 01:31:24.599
To say 'Hey, um, you know,
come on over for a barbecue

01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:28.090
but realise you might be
being surveilled

01:31:28.130 --> 01:31:30.097
and it might be going into the archive

01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:31.848
of the most pernicious, dangerous cult

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.463
that the western world
has known in the past 50 years.'

01:31:34.505 --> 01:31:36.389
You understand what I'm saying?

01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:40.097
But I will tell you this.

01:31:40.130 --> 01:31:42.844
He will rue the day
that he brought my son into this.

01:31:44.005 --> 01:31:45.474
He will rue the day.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.432
You know, we talked early on about...

01:31:54.463 --> 01:31:58.635
You know, you were, er,
you ran private investigators.

01:32:03.088 --> 01:32:06.679
I mean, some of these techniques
were things you did to other people.

01:32:08.005 --> 01:32:10.506
- I mean, you ran Pls who infiltrated...
- You know, you are so wrong.

01:32:10.546 --> 01:32:13.806
I never, ever, even crossed
my mind to think about...

01:32:14.671 --> 01:32:17.847
about bringing a person's
child into something.

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:22.846
I never, ever, ever crossed my mind to use
a terroristic technique like that. Ever.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.136
Nothing like this.

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:27.466
I mean, you had people
pretending to be people's friends

01:32:27.505 --> 01:32:29.140
while secretly...
Yeah, alright.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.132
I mean, I'm not trying
to give you... isn't that a fact?

01:32:33.171 --> 01:32:34.558
- Huh'?
- Isn't that a fact though?

01:32:34.588 --> 01:32:36.721
You're a fucking asshole,
that's a fact.

01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:38.137
Fuck you.

01:32:39.713 --> 01:32:42.723
You know, I'm sitting here having
my child brought into this thing

01:32:42.755 --> 01:32:46.049
and you want to fucking sit here and
make me defend myself. Fuck yourself.

01:32:46.296 --> 01:32:48.797
I have to be subjected to this shit

01:32:48.838 --> 01:32:50.308
and I got to take this shit from him?

01:32:50.338 --> 01:32:51.973
All right, forget it, Marty.
I'm not trying...

01:32:52.005 --> 01:32:53.296
You know, fuck yourself.

01:32:53.338 --> 01:32:56.218
Truly.
I consider myself fucked.

01:32:56.255 --> 01:32:59.052
I don't know what to say now,
like, do you want to change the...

01:32:59.088 --> 01:33:01.636
You should apologise
for starters and say that's...

01:33:01.671 --> 01:33:03.639
we're canceling that,
we'll pick up where we...

01:33:03.671 --> 01:33:06.219
Alright, fine, cancel that.
before that whole thing started.

01:33:07.046 --> 01:33:10.258
But even then, I want
a minute to cool down.

01:33:10.713 --> 01:33:12.302
Because this is really offensive.

01:33:13.338 --> 01:33:16.183
I'm really fucking offended by it.
I'm telling you, I have no life

01:33:16.213 --> 01:33:18.679
I can't even make friendships,
I am unemployable

01:33:18.921 --> 01:33:20.806
and you start giving me this shit?

01:33:30.463 --> 01:33:33.390
That definitely brings us
to both the close of tonight's event

01:33:33.838 --> 01:33:35.427
and the start of a whole new era

01:33:35.463 --> 01:33:38.971
yet before we part I want you to
remember the two operative words

01:33:39.005 --> 01:33:41.932
with which we opened this
evening - Necessity Level.

01:33:42.546 --> 01:33:45.391
The moment you realise
the scope of Scientology

01:33:45.421 --> 01:33:47.887
the very instant
you accepted its power

01:33:47.921 --> 01:33:50.967
in one way or another,
you are committed by necessity

01:33:51.005 --> 01:33:52.924
to help in every way you can.

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:57.338
We mean it. And the only slim
chance that this planet has

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:04.718
rests on a few slim shoulders. Over worked,
underpaid and fought, the scientologist.

01:34:05.213 --> 01:34:06.932
Later on, if we make it

01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:09.804
what will be your answer
to this question?

01:34:10.755 --> 01:34:12.141
Did you help?

01:34:12.755 --> 01:34:16.843
And I say, let's all make it happen.
Thank you very much to LRH.

01:34:17.796 --> 01:34:22.264
<i>That inspirational speech and
the film of the 2004 gala</i>

01:34:22.463 --> 01:34:25.888
<i>is the dream of how the world
would be with Scientology.</i>

01:34:28.088 --> 01:34:30.221
<i>Well-ordered and grandiose</i>

01:34:30.255 --> 01:34:32.507
<i>and reaching for
some higher purpose.</i>

01:34:33.463 --> 01:34:36.046
<i>All the bull baiting and
the shattering suppression</i>

01:34:36.338 --> 01:34:38.306
<i>they're justified because of this.</i>

01:34:40.421 --> 01:34:42.507
<i>And in spite of everything I now know</i>

01:34:42.838 --> 01:34:45.932
a <i>little part of me still feels
the pull of their vision.</i>

01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:49.465
<i>It may be tempting
to look at the faces</i>

01:34:49.505 --> 01:34:50.974
<i>and see foolishness.</i>

01:34:51.713 --> 01:34:55.849
<i>But you could also choose to see good
people who are members of a church</i>

01:34:56.213 --> 01:34:58.547
<i>that's been hijacked
by its own Pope.</i>

01:34:59.088 --> 01:35:01.719
Thank you very much,
see you next year, goodnight.

01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:40.633
Well, they think they're
saving the world, right?

01:35:40.671 --> 01:35:43.303
They see you as the
ultimate suppressive.

01:35:47.338 --> 01:35:50.763
Ah, see, that's where you're wrong.

01:35:51.255 --> 01:35:53.009
That's where you're wrong.

01:35:54.671 --> 01:36:00.798
Ultimately, it's as if he
literally in his warped mind

01:36:00.838 --> 01:36:04.181
is begging me
to end all this for him.

01:36:07.088 --> 01:36:09.091
He knows I'm the truth, man.

01:36:09.505 --> 01:36:12.088
And that is the scariest
thing in the world to him.

01:36:16.005 --> 01:36:17.391
I am done with it.

01:36:20.671 --> 01:36:23.966
And they keep...
- Oh, your number's up, Marty, they're going to arrest you.

01:36:24.005 --> 01:36:25.640
They keep pulling me back in.

01:36:25.671 --> 01:36:27.058
- Morning.
- Howdy.

01:36:27.296 --> 01:36:28.967
We're just doing some
random inspections here today.

01:36:29.005 --> 01:36:30.214
Yeah.
We need to take a look in the back

01:36:30.255 --> 01:36:31.890
make sure you don't have any
missiles hidden back there.

01:36:31.921 --> 01:36:33.308
There's some guys in there.

01:36:33.630 --> 01:36:35.549
It is on, yeah,
that is on, we're filming.

01:36:35.588 --> 01:36:36.880
- Okay.
- We're making a movie.
