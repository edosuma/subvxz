00:07.845 --> 00:09.161
Sunscreen.

00:09.493 --> 00:10.994
Hot dog costumes!

00:11.064 --> 00:12.313
I'm sorry, what?

00:12.371 --> 00:14.264
You know, in case
we get lost at sea

00:14.322 --> 00:15.679
and one of us...
Probably Louie...

00:15.737 --> 00:17.484
Goes mad with hunger,
we'll put these on!

00:17.542 --> 00:19.814
Louie hates hot dogs,
so he probably won't eat us.

00:19.987 --> 00:23.009
Are you saying that Louie would
rather eat us than hot dogs?

00:23.095 --> 00:24.587
I do hate hot dogs.

00:24.682 --> 00:26.040
I think we'll be good.

00:27.673 --> 00:29.415
So what do you
need me to do?

00:29.501 --> 00:31.548
I think that's everything.
Louie's got the canteens,

00:31.622 --> 00:32.651
Dewey's got the paddles...

00:32.708 --> 00:34.808
Nautical leap! Yar!

00:35.017 --> 00:37.212
- Oof!
- And nailed it.

00:38.433 --> 00:40.056
Relax, we've taken
this old kayak

00:40.134 --> 00:41.931
out dozens of times...
We got this.

00:41.989 --> 00:43.744
Maybe I could be
in charge of the map.

00:43.802 --> 00:45.186
Oh, Huey always
handles the map,

00:45.244 --> 00:46.836
thanks to old
Captain Lost here.

00:46.871 --> 00:50.712
Hey! That's Captain Lost, sir,
to you.

00:50.770 --> 00:52.879
Captain Lost!
Captain Lost!

00:54.481 --> 00:56.720
I don't know why we're laughing!

00:56.840 --> 00:58.470
Ah, it's this whole crazy story

00:58.528 --> 01:00.369
where we all went kayaking,
and Louie...

01:00.427 --> 01:01.978
Got lost?

01:02.072 --> 01:04.423
Yeah. You sorta had
to be there, I guess.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.017
But now you will be!

01:08.025 --> 01:10.759
Onward, to adventure!

01:10.884 --> 01:13.611
Pardon me.

01:13.681 --> 01:16.532
Come on, why aren't we
"to adventuring"?

01:16.642 --> 01:18.455
Oof!

01:18.623 --> 01:21.134
I guess we never had to stick
four people in this thing.

01:21.205 --> 01:22.560
Here, Webby, you can
take my spot.

01:22.635 --> 01:24.635
- No, no, it's okay.
- Are you sure?

01:24.694 --> 01:27.212
Yeah, I'll just go
when you guys get back.

01:27.273 --> 01:31.150
Unless Captain Lost
gets us lost again!

01:31.237 --> 01:33.415
Captain Lost!

you get this game.

Hi, I'm Webby.

03:41.270 --> 03:42.843
Mm. Hey.

03:43.667 --> 03:46.288
Is that a vintage
Sumerian talisman?

03:46.346 --> 03:48.390
Dunno. Found it
at a thrift shop.

03:49.070 --> 03:51.371
How... ha! You got
some pink in your hair.

03:51.429 --> 03:52.813
I-I think someone
pranked you.

03:52.897 --> 03:54.187
It's supposed
to look this way.

03:54.265 --> 03:57.421
Oh! Oh...
I like your shirt!

03:57.487 --> 03:58.863
Mm, not my shirt.
Actually got it

03:58.921 --> 04:00.960
off the lead singer
of the Featherweights

04:01.101 --> 04:02.631
after a gig in Paris.

04:02.708 --> 04:04.632
You've been
to Paris?!

04:04.820 --> 04:05.878
You haven't?

04:05.936 --> 04:07.561
Oh, you gotta go.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.658
It's like here,
only fancier.

04:09.716 --> 04:11.132
I've always wanted
to go to Paris,

04:11.249 --> 04:12.889
crawl around
in the catacombs,

04:12.998 --> 04:14.951
maybe touch a skull.

04:17.911 --> 04:19.166
Welp, game over.

04:19.225 --> 04:20.279
I got it!

04:26.694 --> 04:27.718
Here!

04:27.776 --> 04:30.756
That was actually
pretty cool.

04:30.834 --> 04:32.388
Are you, like,
in the circus?

04:32.446 --> 04:35.102
Circus acrobats keep elephant hairs
in their pockets for good luck!

04:35.160 --> 04:37.704
I don't know why I just told you
that, or why I'm still talking,

04:37.762 --> 04:39.909
or why I pointed out
the fact I'm still talking, or...

04:39.967 --> 04:41.670
- Whoa, easy, Flippy.
- Webby!

04:41.740 --> 04:43.432
Lena. Thanks
for the bottle.

04:45.509 --> 04:48.904

04:52.917 --> 04:54.225

for "party."

04:54.283 --> 04:55.670
Yep! Totally knew that.

04:56.147 --> 04:57.667
Could we just wait
for my friends

04:57.725 --> 04:59.350
so I could let them know
where I'm going?

04:59.408 --> 05:01.108
But the party could
be over by then.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.506

an adventure!

are at burnt-out junkyards.

Wait, aren't you invited?

05:24.322 --> 05:27.076
It's not an adventure
if you're invited.

05:35.142 --> 05:36.897
- Got it!
- Nice.

05:38.205 --> 05:41.303
Oh... yeah!

a pond to you?

10:44.885 --> 10:46.682
I don't think
she could swim.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.570
I don't even think
she showers!

10:48.647 --> 10:50.002
I smell a rat.

10:50.060 --> 10:53.557
We're from England, guv,
just a little Cockney, innit?

10:53.626 --> 10:57.025

bangers and mash...

10:57.150 --> 10:59.322

10:59.380 --> 11:00.605

11:06.732 --> 11:08.283

Englabeth.

11:12.853 --> 11:15.142
She talks fancy.
I trust her.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.033
Well, they are family.
I mean, why would they lie?

11:18.091 --> 11:20.791
Marvelous! Well, it was
wonderful to meet you.

11:20.932 --> 11:23.283
- I'm taking this.
- Well, um...

11:23.350 --> 11:26.713
A keepsake
of our serendipitous meeting!

11:26.893 --> 11:29.307
Stupendous!

11:31.401 --> 11:32.830
Ta-ta!

11:34.455 --> 11:35.821
Wait, was that them?

11:41.932 --> 11:43.752
You totally
clowned those jokers,

11:43.845 --> 11:46.624
and we got a radio
so we can track them!

11:46.682 --> 11:49.017
Where did you get
that tea-and-crumpets talk?

11:49.075 --> 11:51.932
I live with my British granny
in a Scottish mansion.

11:51.990 --> 11:55.686
I didn't hear an American accent
till I was, like, seven.

11:58.189 --> 12:02.017
With my brains and your weirdly
specific super-brains,

12:02.075 --> 12:03.314
we could run this town!

12:03.393 --> 12:04.885
Innit that right,
Englabeth?

12:04.943 --> 12:07.400
Most indubitably,
Brittania!

12:07.807 --> 12:10.610
Hah! Wait until the guys
hear my new nickname!

12:10.687 --> 12:13.588
You mean those three nerds
who ditched you on a beach?

12:13.665 --> 12:16.258
Yeah, they sound
real fun.

12:17.114 --> 12:18.396
Oh, no, no!

12:18.454 --> 12:20.150
There were only three spots
on the boat,

12:20.208 --> 12:21.379
so I let them go.

12:21.437 --> 12:23.658
We're cool like that.
It's a family thing.

12:23.736 --> 12:26.330
Family, huh?
Not really my thing.

12:26.578 --> 12:28.416
But family is the best!

12:28.605 --> 12:30.252
You go on adventures together,

12:30.310 --> 12:31.541
make inside jokes!

12:31.599 --> 12:34.439
Like there was
this hilarious joke

12:34.572 --> 12:37.799
where they went out boating
and Huey got them lost,

12:37.869 --> 12:41.353
and since then, they call
him Captain Lost!

12:41.411 --> 12:44.361
Yeah, I don't get it, either.

12:44.454 --> 12:48.189
Uff! Sometimes it's like they
have their own secret language.

12:48.247 --> 12:50.014
It's just...
I don't know.

12:50.072 --> 12:51.775
They have so much
history together.

12:51.864 --> 12:54.103
Well, now
we have history.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.266
Lena, no!

13:06.343 --> 13:08.610
These are the guys
I was talking about!

13:08.687 --> 13:10.077
Oh.

13:10.420 --> 13:13.670
Lena, this is Huey,
Dewey, and Louie.

13:13.736 --> 13:16.142
Webby, we've been looking
for you everywhere!

13:16.284 --> 13:19.580
Cute, with the names
and the color-coded outfits.

13:19.705 --> 13:22.490
Is that, like, your thing,
you're all exactly the same?

13:22.567 --> 13:25.318
Hah! No way!
We're all unique snowflakes!

13:25.471 --> 13:26.869
Well, this usually
never happens!

13:26.927 --> 13:29.061
This is really weird!
Okay, stop talking!

13:29.320 --> 13:31.245
Antidisestablishmentarianism!

13:31.315 --> 13:33.142
Seriously? Gah!

13:34.324 --> 13:36.161
Seriously, Webby,
where have you been?

13:36.242 --> 13:37.676
We've been worried
out of our minds!

13:37.749 --> 13:40.167
Well, uh, Lena and I...

13:40.244 --> 13:43.242
Right, you were so worried
that you left her on a beach

13:43.300 --> 13:45.133
and didn't show up
for four hours?

13:45.191 --> 13:46.242
We got lost!

13:46.300 --> 13:48.199
Thanks to old
Captain Lost!

13:48.257 --> 13:50.297
Why would you put me
in charge of the map again?

13:50.354 --> 13:51.524
This is not on me.

13:51.582 --> 13:54.110
Captain Lost!
Captain Lost!

13:54.168 --> 13:56.774
Ooh, you change
the tone of that chant!

13:56.832 --> 13:59.289
Ye

13:59.414 --> 14:03.313
Guys, easy! We were
just having a little adventure.

14:08.602 --> 14:09.641
What was that?

14:09.699 --> 14:11.457
Shh!

14:14.700 --> 14:16.086
<i>Ma to the Tumblebums.</i>

14:16.202 --> 14:18.302
<i>The rugrats have been spotted
in your turf.</i>

14:18.590 --> 14:21.156
<i>Make 'em sorry
they crashed our party!</i>

14:21.260 --> 14:23.426
The Tumblebums?
They sound adorable!

14:33.369 --> 14:34.524
Never mind.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.860
- No way! You check!
- No, you check!

14:39.937 --> 14:41.288
- Ohh...
- You go right now!

14:47.896 --> 14:49.887
Why are the Beagle Boys
even after you?

14:49.945 --> 14:51.755
Because we shoved
their mother's face in a cake.

14:51.812 --> 14:53.205
Try to keep up, Louie.

14:53.354 --> 14:55.984
Heh! Well, we've kind of
been having a girls' night.

14:58.744 --> 15:00.127
We need a plan.

15:00.185 --> 15:02.909
Okay, we've got a compass,
a half-empty canteen,

15:03.060 --> 15:05.052
three old banana peels...
Wait, wait, three?

15:05.137 --> 15:06.044
Did you eat my banana? -

15:06.102 --> 15:07.627
Yeah,
it's called stress eating, okay,

15:07.685 --> 15:09.607
and it's a stressful situation.

15:12.774 --> 15:15.279
Hey, I need
my potassium!

15:15.847 --> 15:17.898
Let's make
a break for it.

15:17.967 --> 15:19.833
- What?
- Let the boy band be bait

15:19.891 --> 15:21.015
while we sneak out.

15:21.073 --> 15:22.771
I can't leave them!

15:22.829 --> 15:25.318
You mean like they left
you alone on that beach?

15:25.568 --> 15:27.606
Come on, don't
you trust me?

15:33.021 --> 15:34.521
Wait right here.

15:35.346 --> 15:36.669
Whatever.

15:37.591 --> 15:38.662
Stop.
Think.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.334
Okay, how do you get rid of
an evil clown?

16:05.130 --> 16:06.915
Yah!

16:11.535 --> 16:13.251
Lena, did you see that?

16:13.695 --> 16:15.070
Lena?

16:26.455 --> 16:27.594
You okay?

16:27.652 --> 16:28.918
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:29.019 --> 16:30.103
It's dumb.

16:30.180 --> 16:32.167
I just...
I thought Lena and I

16:32.277 --> 16:34.597
could maybe have
what you three have.

16:35.425 --> 16:37.777
I promise we'll never leave
you off the boat again.

16:37.874 --> 16:40.331
We'll leave Louie.
He's bad at most things.

16:43.894 --> 16:46.831
"Webby, I've been kidnapped
by the Beagle Boys."

16:46.964 --> 16:49.386
Wait, is this another prank?

16:50.646 --> 16:53.226
"This is not a prank.
Lena."

16:53.284 --> 16:55.909
She didn't ditch me!
She was captured!

16:55.979 --> 16:57.964
Oh, wait,
she was captured.

17:02.824 --> 17:03.879
Aah!

17:05.848 --> 17:07.847
<i>I'm on my way, boys.</i>

17:08.050 --> 17:10.166
<i>I may not have gotten
to eat my birthday cake,</i>

17:10.284 --> 17:12.877
<i>but at least I'll get
a little slice of revenge.</i>

17:13.029 --> 17:14.545
We have to help her!

17:14.603 --> 17:15.741
We should go
get Uncle Scrooge

17:15.798 --> 17:17.948
and Beakley
and a couple of tanks.

17:18.089 --> 17:19.472
There's no time.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.339
Look, me and Lena
fought a truck

17:21.405 --> 17:23.425
and beat the Taquitos
and were British together.

17:23.483 --> 17:25.058
I don't know what
any of that means.

17:25.242 --> 17:27.636
Now you know how I feel
half the time.

17:27.694 --> 17:28.887
You wouldn't leave
each other behind

17:28.944 --> 17:30.284
and I'm not leaving her.

17:30.402 --> 17:31.737
Now, come on!

17:31.795 --> 17:35.105
And this time I'm getting
a spot in the stupid boat!

17:42.046 --> 17:44.947
Uh, guys, I kind of got
a situation here.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.446
A little help?

17:48.789 --> 17:50.046
Rough day, huh?

17:50.132 --> 17:51.571
Well, here.

17:51.629 --> 17:53.876
Courtesy of the
Sixth Avenue Friendlies.

17:54.048 --> 17:56.790
Courtesy of the
Sixth Avenue Meanies.

17:58.884 --> 18:01.010
Psst, over here!

18:03.620 --> 18:05.493
Webby, you came!

18:05.551 --> 18:07.032
Like I would ditch you.

18:07.152 --> 18:09.329
We're the Beagle Birds.

18:21.987 --> 18:25.480
You two ladies have given us
a lot of trouble tonight.

18:25.556 --> 18:28.392
But it'll be worth it
when Ma sees her birthday gift.

18:28.450 --> 18:30.834
And we got some early
Mother's Day shopping

18:30.892 --> 18:32.681
out of the way, too.

18:33.106 --> 18:35.536
Big Time to Ma, Big Time
to Ma, what's your 10-20?

18:35.642 --> 18:39.602
Seriously, your rescue plan
was to throw yourself blindly

18:39.660 --> 18:42.169
into the middle of the
entire Beagle Family?

18:42.227 --> 18:45.271
How is that any different than
what you did at the junkyard?

18:45.329 --> 18:48.267
I wasn't tied up
at the junkyard.

18:48.884 --> 18:50.524
Now they have
what we have.

18:50.792 --> 18:53.128
Now I remember
why I avoid family.

18:53.186 --> 18:56.313
- All they do is...
- Fight?

18:56.828 --> 18:59.415
Okay, Ma should be here
any second.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.340
When Botched Job
gives the signal,

19:01.398 --> 19:03.462
we all leap out
and yell surprise.

19:03.567 --> 19:05.977
- Any questions?
- Yeah, I got one.

19:06.058 --> 19:08.529
Which one of you
gets to hand us over?

19:08.587 --> 19:09.665
Say what, now?

19:09.723 --> 19:11.649
I mean, you could
all hand us over

19:11.707 --> 19:13.634
and share the credit,
or...

19:13.715 --> 19:16.128
Well, obviously
we should do it.

19:16.186 --> 19:17.901
I mean, we're, like,
the main guys, right?

19:17.959 --> 19:20.009
- Give someone else a chance.
- Yeah.

19:20.079 --> 19:21.912
We're, like,
anti-authority, bro.

19:21.970 --> 19:23.408
We don't believe
in following.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.557
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure
they was adopted.

19:25.615 --> 19:27.909
Now that was uncalled for,
Mister.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.800
Even if I have heard
the same rumor.

19:35.899 --> 19:38.000
Oh ho hoh!, finally!

19:39.296 --> 19:41.172
Hey, who threw that?

19:41.230 --> 19:43.871
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

19:46.943 --> 19:49.043
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

19:49.101 --> 19:51.060
Fight! Fight! Fight!

19:54.757 --> 19:56.567
Whoa...

19:58.054 --> 19:59.334
Whoa!

20:19.427 --> 20:21.735
- Yah! Yoh!
- Let go!

20:21.794 --> 20:23.028
Whoa!

20:43.792 --> 20:44.914
Hey!

20:46.003 --> 20:47.235
Where are the brats?

20:47.312 --> 20:49.762
Um...

20:49.839 --> 20:51.998
For the love of...
That's it.

20:52.129 --> 20:54.242
None of you get birthdays
this year.

20:54.402 --> 20:57.011
Aww.

20:59.687 --> 21:01.504
That was awesome!

21:01.562 --> 21:03.362
How you made the Beagle
Boys fight each other

21:03.420 --> 21:04.767
so we could escape,
and then...

21:04.825 --> 21:07.316
Well, you shimmied up
that pillar like a pro.

21:07.374 --> 21:09.196
You turned the entire
Beagle family

21:09.254 --> 21:10.769
against each other
with a question.

21:10.827 --> 21:12.652
You are my new favorite.

21:12.862 --> 21:14.050
No big.

21:14.108 --> 21:16.301
That's what family's
about, eh, Englabeth?

21:16.413 --> 21:19.684
Oh, I knew you'd come through
in a spot, Brittania.

21:19.742 --> 21:22.074
A lil Penny-come-quick
to get ya yet to be.

21:22.170 --> 21:23.828
Fluff and nonsense.

21:26.574 --> 21:29.051
You kinda
had to be there.

21:40.775 --> 21:43.152
Summoned spirit from the dark,

21:43.285 --> 21:46.270
show thyself before this arc.

21:46.426 --> 21:49.230
Free thy dread soul
from its prison,

21:49.363 --> 21:53.059
Once more shall thee be risen!

21:53.363 --> 21:56.301
Aunt Magica, I'm in.
