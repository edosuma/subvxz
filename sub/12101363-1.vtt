00:08.759 --> 00:11.676
(slow music plays)

00:28.769 --> 00:30.279
(gasps)

00:30.279 --> 00:32.680
- Good to see you again, Mr. Thomas.

00:32.680 --> 00:33.620
- You scared me to death.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.320
- I didn't mean to startle you.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.889
They told me I could store
a few things out here.

00:37.889 --> 00:38.820
- Yeah.

00:38.820 --> 00:40.543
Yeah, I guess I'd be okay.

00:42.350 --> 00:45.748
Considering everything else
has been stored out here.

00:45.748 --> 00:48.665
(slow music plays)

01:06.935 --> 01:09.352
(wind blows)

01:10.615 --> 01:13.532
(students chatter)

01:19.507 --> 01:20.787
- With us?

01:20.787 --> 01:22.308
Eew, today?

01:22.308 --> 01:23.371
- Wattup bruh.

01:23.371 --> 01:24.204
- Wattup.

01:24.204 --> 01:25.331
- Did you see the ending to the premier?

01:25.331 --> 01:26.164
(background noise drowns other sounds)

01:26.164 --> 01:28.810
- All right, ladies and
gentlemen, I know it's been awhile

01:28.810 --> 01:29.750
but that was the bell.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.053
So let's get going.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.701
Well, welcome back.

01:34.701 --> 01:35.810
(students cheer)
- Yeah.

01:35.810 --> 01:36.643
- It's been what?

01:36.643 --> 01:39.570
11 months since we've
seen each other in person?

01:39.570 --> 01:44.230
But the pandemic is slowing
down, we're back to school.

01:44.230 --> 01:45.900
We've only missed a couple
of months this semester,

01:45.900 --> 01:49.341
but we're back and good to
see your guys' smiling faces.

01:49.341 --> 01:52.370
In fact, I see a couple
of new faces in the crowd.

01:52.370 --> 01:55.440
We have Olivia and her brother Maddox.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.640
They're from West Virginia.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.460
Let's welcome them to our drama class.

01:59.460 --> 02:00.540
(students clap)

02:00.540 --> 02:02.160
Oh, that was great guys.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.581
Maddox, are you okay, buddy?

02:04.581 --> 02:05.581
- He's fine.

02:06.880 --> 02:07.910
- Okay.

02:07.910 --> 02:08.743
All right.

02:08.743 --> 02:13.682
Well, so the good news is
we still have a drama class.

02:13.682 --> 02:15.224
(student's cheer)

02:15.224 --> 02:17.573
- Hey yoh, Mr. T, are
we going to be able--

02:17.573 --> 02:19.470
- I already know what
you're going to ask me.

02:19.470 --> 02:23.530
And the answer is yes, I believe so.

02:23.530 --> 02:27.321
Now, according to the
governor, and as of right now,

02:27.321 --> 02:30.466
we will be able to put
on a play this spring.

02:30.466 --> 02:31.682
(students cheer)

02:31.682 --> 02:33.580
But, but, but, but, we
still got a few things

02:33.580 --> 02:34.470
we got to worry about.

02:34.470 --> 02:36.950
First and foremost, we had
to find out how much money

02:36.950 --> 02:39.737
is in the school budget for
the theater class this year.

02:39.737 --> 02:42.360
Then we've got a few other
administrative things

02:42.360 --> 02:43.550
that have to be taken care of.

02:43.550 --> 02:46.137
But those are for me to
worry about not you guys.

02:46.137 --> 02:47.180
All right?

02:47.180 --> 02:51.200
The big thing we have to take
care of is this mess up here.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.560
Like they've been using the area

02:52.560 --> 02:54.470
for storage since we went out of school.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.920
So it is an absolute mess.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.210
And we're going to have to get that clean

02:58.210 --> 03:00.120
before we can do anything.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.990
And we've got what?

03:01.990 --> 03:03.790
12 weeks left in the semester.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.870
So if we're going to put together a play,

03:05.870 --> 03:07.670
we got to get working on it.

03:07.670 --> 03:10.875
But I'm not going to decide the
play for you guys this year.

03:10.875 --> 03:12.974
It's going to be up to you.

03:12.974 --> 03:14.280
All right.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.620
Well, I see a few excited faces and a few

03:16.620 --> 03:19.900
not so excited faces, but
hey guys, that's creativity.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.090
So I want you guys to be thinking

03:22.090 --> 03:23.270
about what you're going to do.

03:23.270 --> 03:28.270
Talk amongst yourselves while
you're cleaning the stage.

03:28.594 --> 03:29.700
(students sigh)
(ukulele plays)

03:29.700 --> 03:30.533
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:30.533 --> 03:31.366
I know.

03:31.366 --> 03:32.199
Come on everybody.

03:32.199 --> 03:33.710
We got to get cleaning.

03:33.710 --> 03:38.188
Grab a broom, grab a brush,
grab a towel, grab a flan.

03:38.188 --> 03:41.271
(upbeat music plays)

04:33.610 --> 04:35.710
- What if we did Oklahoma?

04:35.710 --> 04:37.550
- We already did that
though, thus the hat.

04:37.550 --> 04:39.479
- Well, that's why it's perfect.

04:39.479 --> 04:40.660
We already have everything.

04:40.660 --> 04:42.563
- It still seems a little much.

04:45.809 --> 04:46.978
- What do you think?

04:46.978 --> 04:47.975
- I like it.

04:47.975 --> 04:49.137
(laughs)

04:49.137 --> 04:50.580
- We could make our
own original Star Wars.

04:50.580 --> 04:53.660
First, we start with a
black backdrop as space,

04:53.660 --> 04:55.378
then poke holes in it for stars.

04:55.378 --> 04:59.150
And then we raid the junkyard

04:59.150 --> 05:01.370
and make a bunch of robot costumes.

05:01.370 --> 05:04.720
It could be the day
after Obi wan Kenobi dies

05:04.720 --> 05:07.240
but before he comes alive and
all those visions, you know.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.487
So it'll be the day after the, the, the...

05:11.719 --> 05:12.552
You know, whatever.

05:12.552 --> 05:13.950
It'll be cool.

05:13.950 --> 05:16.370
We'll have the cool
laser swords, we'll be...

05:16.370 --> 05:19.180
Make all the newbies
all the aliens we kill.

05:19.180 --> 05:20.013
- Laser swords?

05:20.013 --> 05:21.380
- We could really pull this off guys.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.970
- Light slavers.

05:22.970 --> 05:26.530
- What if we just pull a random
script and keep it simple?

05:26.530 --> 05:27.600
Like a two act play.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.670
- That's boring.

05:28.670 --> 05:29.740
- You heard them.

05:29.740 --> 05:30.600
We get to choose.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.860
Why not make it something crazy?

05:31.860 --> 05:33.780
You know, something original?

05:33.780 --> 05:35.437
- Something happy?

05:35.437 --> 05:37.997
- Mama Mia makes me happy.

05:37.997 --> 05:39.254
♪ Mama Mia ♪

05:39.254 --> 05:40.950
♪ Here I go again ♪

05:40.950 --> 05:43.170
- Mama Mia is not an original.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.870
- We need something
with a positive message.

05:45.870 --> 05:47.698
- Mary Poppins.

05:47.698 --> 05:50.220
♪ supercalifragilistic XVI ♪

05:50.220 --> 05:52.760
- Mary Poppins is not an original.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.760
- Guys, think about this past year.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.660
I mean, we need something with meaning

05:58.690 --> 06:01.655
Something that will make a difference.

06:01.655 --> 06:04.572
(soft music plays)

06:16.353 --> 06:17.910
- Hey guys, what if we do
a play about the Shining?

06:17.910 --> 06:19.330
It's got different
kinds of axes and blood.

06:19.330 --> 06:22.274
- I think, we should do One Fish Two Fish.

06:22.274 --> 06:25.491
Fish Nutry and Maddie
should be the Fish Nutry.

06:25.491 --> 06:26.810
- Okay.

06:26.810 --> 06:28.014
Be serious.

06:28.014 --> 06:28.847
- Yoh.

06:29.891 --> 06:31.326
Ratatouille.

06:31.326 --> 06:34.310
(laughs)
- Ratatouille.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.780
Guys, look at all these curls.

06:36.780 --> 06:37.880
- [Boy] I know, right?

06:40.330 --> 06:41.682
- Better.

06:41.682 --> 06:42.515
- Leave him alone.

06:42.515 --> 06:43.348
- [Boy] Wow.

06:43.348 --> 06:45.892
- [Boy] Does she just fight your fights?

06:45.892 --> 06:47.233
- [Boy] See you later rat boy.

06:47.233 --> 06:49.316
(laughs)

06:57.433 --> 06:59.369
- They're just some jerks.

06:59.369 --> 07:02.619
(dramatic music plays)

07:06.210 --> 07:07.400
- I totally understand.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.900
(door knocks)

07:11.013 --> 07:12.110
- Okay.

07:12.110 --> 07:12.943
Yeah,

07:12.943 --> 07:14.080
I'll I'll, I'll call you back then.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.520
Thank you.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.390
What can do you for?

07:16.390 --> 07:17.500
- Sorry to bother you.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.180
Do you have just a minute?

07:19.180 --> 07:21.260
- No, I never have a minute,
but for you I'll make it.

07:21.260 --> 07:22.093
What can I do?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.270
- Well, I just wanted to talk with you

07:24.270 --> 07:26.070
since the governor has released a lot

07:26.070 --> 07:27.570
of the COVID restrictions,

07:27.570 --> 07:29.860
wanting to see what we might
be able to do for the budget

07:29.860 --> 07:31.170
for this year's play.

07:31.170 --> 07:32.570
The kids are super...

07:32.570 --> 07:34.220
- Let me cut you off right there.

07:35.060 --> 07:36.130
I don't want to be harsh about this,

07:36.130 --> 07:39.370
but there's no possible way right now

07:39.370 --> 07:41.600
that we can afford to do that.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.790
- But the restrictions have been lifted...

07:43.790 --> 07:45.540
- No, I know the governor has re...

07:46.943 --> 07:47.790
That doesn't change the fact
that we've had to make cuts

07:48.999 --> 07:50.633
across every single
department, not just the arts.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.700
- What am I supposed to tell the kids?

07:59.762 --> 08:02.790
- No, don't tell them anything right now.

08:02.790 --> 08:05.470
I will do my very best to try to come up

08:05.470 --> 08:09.750
with some extra money, but
I wouldn't keep my hopes up

08:09.750 --> 08:10.583
if I were you.

08:12.340 --> 08:13.640
- Okay.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.473
Fair enough.

08:16.170 --> 08:17.003
Thanks Robert.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.083
- Becky, can you give
me Dr. Anderson, please?

08:33.610 --> 08:34.443
- Hey.

08:34.443 --> 08:35.420
- Hey.

08:35.420 --> 08:38.031
- So welcome to Henderson.

08:38.031 --> 08:39.360
- Thanks.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.710
- Maybe I could share
around the town sometime?

08:42.600 --> 08:43.683
- There's a town?

08:46.330 --> 08:47.163
- Sure.

08:47.163 --> 08:50.045
(cheeky music plays)

08:59.050 --> 09:00.950
- So hun, tell me about your day today.

09:00.950 --> 09:01.793
How did it go?

09:02.664 --> 09:03.887
- It was fine.

09:03.887 --> 09:04.962
I don't know.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.030
- Oh yeah?

09:06.030 --> 09:07.920
Well, you know, I love you

09:07.920 --> 09:10.960
but I have to say with everybody
going back to school today

09:10.960 --> 09:12.900
I had the best day.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.440
I went and got coffee.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.860
I get to go shopping.

09:15.860 --> 09:17.170
Man, it was good.

09:17.170 --> 09:18.210
Good day.

09:18.210 --> 09:19.410
- Okay.

09:19.410 --> 09:20.243
That's great.

09:24.420 --> 09:27.230
We have to come up with our
own play and drama this year.

09:27.230 --> 09:28.260
- Oh, is that right?

09:28.260 --> 09:29.810
That sounds exciting.

09:29.810 --> 09:30.650
Is it a drama?

09:30.650 --> 09:31.483
Is it a comedy?

09:31.483 --> 09:32.936
What's the deal with it?

09:32.936 --> 09:33.769
- We don't know.

09:33.769 --> 09:34.872
I mean, I suggest something heart felt,

09:34.872 --> 09:37.016
because of COVID and everything,

09:37.016 --> 09:40.180
but I'm pretty sure everybody
wants to do a comedy.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.290
- Oh, can you not do both?

09:42.290 --> 09:44.160
I think you can just do both.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.510
I think that would be fine.

09:46.431 --> 09:49.160
Do you have like a deadline
as to when it's due?

09:49.160 --> 09:51.803
- No, he just said he
wanted it done in May.

09:52.790 --> 09:53.623
- Okay.

09:53.623 --> 09:54.456
You know what?

09:54.456 --> 09:55.289
I got an idea.

09:55.289 --> 09:57.130
How about if you did May...

09:57.130 --> 09:58.350
Like a theme of May.

09:58.350 --> 09:59.820
Something that happens in may.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.080
- Like Easter?

10:01.080 --> 10:02.130
- No, no, no.

10:02.130 --> 10:02.963
It's not Easter.

10:02.963 --> 10:04.150
Easter is in April.

10:04.150 --> 10:06.700
Sometimes it's in March,
but usually April,

10:06.700 --> 10:07.873
never May though.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.593
- Okay.

10:11.110 --> 10:11.943
- Okay.

10:11.943 --> 10:14.440
So, you know, I just want
to tell you what happened.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.750
It was the funniest thing.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.940
So I go to the coffee shop today.

10:17.940 --> 10:19.070
I'm getting out of the car

10:19.070 --> 10:20.671
and you will not believe what happened.

10:20.671 --> 10:21.504
(phone rings)

10:21.504 --> 10:22.464
I was getting ready to...

10:22.464 --> 10:23.901
- Hey, hang on?.

10:23.901 --> 10:24.750
- Okay.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.910
Well, I guess we're done talking.

10:29.839 --> 10:32.922
(cheeky music plays)

10:38.640 --> 10:39.473
- Yeah, dude.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.040
I don't know what to
do because we signed up

10:41.040 --> 10:44.060
to take Home-EC, but my mom
always looks at my schedule.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.110
She's going to see that on there

10:45.110 --> 10:46.896
and she's not going to let me keep it.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.313
(bell rings)

10:51.740 --> 10:52.730
- Good day

10:52.730 --> 10:53.873
Step in, sir.

10:53.873 --> 10:54.950
- Hoy, how you doing?

10:54.950 --> 10:56.720
- Put it her, please.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.553
- Thank you.

10:57.553 --> 10:59.056
- Yeah, whatever.

10:59.056 --> 11:00.837
Hey, did you happen to
write down the pages

11:00.837 --> 11:02.150
we're supposed to read
tonight for history?

11:02.150 --> 11:03.814
Just really quick, tell me.

11:03.814 --> 11:04.960
Thanks.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.460
(cheeky music plays)

11:07.460 --> 11:08.680
- Pretty sweet house you got here

11:08.680 --> 11:09.513
- Whatever.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.130
- Have a good one.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.030
- Hello.

11:20.030 --> 11:21.230
And how are you doing today?

11:21.230 --> 11:23.838
My name is Winston I'm with
ServPro it's my understanding

11:23.838 --> 11:24.671
that...

11:24.671 --> 11:25.504
- Thank you for coming.

11:25.504 --> 11:26.340
Quincy can show you to the cellar.

11:26.340 --> 11:27.920
Thank you.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.340
- Okay.

11:29.340 --> 11:30.173
- Right this way, sir.

11:30.173 --> 11:31.006
- Yes, sir.

11:33.558 --> 11:38.558
- Madison, can you come in here, please?

11:39.705 --> 11:42.205
Madison, can you come in here?

11:58.604 --> 11:59.437
Schedule.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.800
Are these your assignments for tonight?

12:07.800 --> 12:08.723
- Yes, ma'am.

12:11.750 --> 12:12.653
- Home-EC?

12:13.650 --> 12:15.303
- Home Economics.

12:16.580 --> 12:17.677
It's an elective.

12:17.677 --> 12:20.270
We get to pick one our senior year.

12:20.270 --> 12:21.646
So--

12:21.646 --> 12:22.680
- I thought theater was an elective.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.990
- It is.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.170
It's an arts elective.

12:25.170 --> 12:26.755
This is just something--

12:26.755 --> 12:28.051
- It's a waste.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.083
Pencil, pencil.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.973
I'm going to sign you up
for two semesters of Latin

12:34.973 --> 12:36.020
and French.

12:36.020 --> 12:37.830
That should get you to
the end of the year.

12:37.830 --> 12:38.663
- But...

12:38.663 --> 12:40.000
Why are you doing this?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.620
- Honey, the economics of home is simple.

12:42.620 --> 12:46.150
You hire people to do things
for you and the theater.

12:46.150 --> 12:48.453
Well, the theater is dead.

12:51.710 --> 12:53.600
- Mom, that's not fair.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.533
- Oh, life's not fair.

13:07.530 --> 13:10.223
That's all Quincy, you may go.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.320
- Yes, madam.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.570
(dramatic music plays)

13:26.998 --> 13:29.498
(pencil rubs)

13:40.015 --> 13:42.348
(car hoots)

13:53.757 --> 13:56.507
(people chatter)

14:24.210 --> 14:25.043
- Hey mom.

14:25.043 --> 14:25.876
- Hey Carson.

14:25.876 --> 14:26.709
Hey, how was it?

14:26.709 --> 14:27.610
- It was the same.

14:27.610 --> 14:28.800
- Did you have to wear a mask?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.420
- No, some kids did though.

14:30.420 --> 14:31.980
- Well, you should, you know.

14:31.980 --> 14:33.370
My baby's growing up so fast.

14:33.370 --> 14:34.720
He's going off to college soon.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.234
I'm so proud of you.

14:36.234 --> 14:37.210
(laughs)

14:37.210 --> 14:38.550
Hey, I have to work a double tonight.

14:38.550 --> 14:39.383
- No worries.

14:39.383 --> 14:40.340
I'll just pick you up later.

14:40.340 --> 14:41.600
- Okay.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.777
Hey, hey, hey.

14:44.356 --> 14:46.939
(kisses cheek)

14:49.076 --> 14:51.826
(exhales loudly)

14:55.397 --> 14:56.230
- Hey mom.

14:56.230 --> 14:57.087
- Hey hun.

14:58.239 --> 15:00.240
- I think I'll give you
guys some alone time.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.073
- Thanks.

15:03.530 --> 15:05.420
- Didn't Dana come with the kids?

15:05.420 --> 15:07.040
- No, it's first day of school.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.610
So back to home work for them.

15:09.610 --> 15:11.210
- You're back to school too.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.677
- Yeah, that's a good day.

15:12.677 --> 15:14.340
I got good kids.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.460
- Good, good.

15:16.460 --> 15:18.294
- Mom, how are you feeling?

15:18.294 --> 15:19.127
(throat clears)

15:19.127 --> 15:21.670
- Son, I think you should know.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.870
I'm ready.

15:22.870 --> 15:24.878
- Oh mom, don't talk like that.

15:24.878 --> 15:26.190
- What?

15:26.190 --> 15:29.560
- You know what I don't like
when you talk like that.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.020
- What?

15:31.020 --> 15:33.650
I'm ready for my stories to start.

15:33.650 --> 15:34.483
- Mom.

15:35.555 --> 15:36.388
(laughs)

15:36.388 --> 15:37.977
- What'd you think I meant?

15:37.977 --> 15:39.300
- You know what I thought you meant?

15:39.300 --> 15:40.133
- I got you.

15:40.133 --> 15:41.589
- You're always the prankster.

15:41.589 --> 15:42.586
(laughs)

15:42.586 --> 15:44.340
- [Announcer] America's
favorite family announcements.

15:45.490 --> 15:46.700
- It's not working.

15:46.700 --> 15:49.300
- Well, that's what you get
for getting a cheap one.

15:51.766 --> 15:55.070
- It's asking for like rational numbers.

15:55.070 --> 15:56.469
Do you know what that means?

15:56.469 --> 15:57.302
- I got it.

15:57.302 --> 15:59.220
So you're just going to add this one here.

16:00.370 --> 16:02.530
- So how was school?

16:02.530 --> 16:03.393
- It was fine.

16:04.470 --> 16:05.400
- And the theater program?

16:05.400 --> 16:06.253
Did you get in?

16:07.350 --> 16:09.350
- Yeah, I guess we'll see how that goes.

16:10.725 --> 16:11.825
- We're the kids nice?

16:14.124 --> 16:15.660
- It's different.

16:15.660 --> 16:16.493
- Of course it's different.

16:16.493 --> 16:17.326
It's a new school.

16:17.326 --> 16:19.807
- There's punks at every
school, Maddox get over it.

16:19.807 --> 16:21.670
- What's that about?

16:21.670 --> 16:23.570
- Just a couple of kids picked on him.

16:25.210 --> 16:26.810
- You know I'll call the principal.

16:26.810 --> 16:27.996
- Yeah.

16:27.996 --> 16:29.153
That's exactly what you can't do.

16:31.970 --> 16:32.803
He'll be fine.

16:32.803 --> 16:34.440
But no offense.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.683
Let me handle this.

16:40.490 --> 16:41.791
- What's two times two.

16:41.791 --> 16:43.110
- I mean they're fine, but like I said,

16:43.110 --> 16:45.210
we going to need to finish this deal soon.

16:46.070 --> 16:48.980
We're going to have to, or
we're going to loose it.

16:48.980 --> 16:51.356
Alright, we'll talk soon.

16:51.356 --> 16:52.497
Bye-bye.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.517
Hey guys.

16:55.517 --> 16:57.061
- Hey mom.

16:57.061 --> 16:58.063
- How was school?

16:58.063 --> 16:59.141
- It was good, mom.

16:59.141 --> 17:00.321
- First day.

17:00.321 --> 17:01.154
- Yeah.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.333
- You like your teachers?

17:02.333 --> 17:03.335
- Yeah.

17:03.335 --> 17:04.168
- Is it good to see all your friends?

17:04.168 --> 17:05.001
- Yeah.

17:05.001 --> 17:05.834
- Oh good.

17:05.834 --> 17:06.667
Are you guys doing homework?

17:06.667 --> 17:08.480
- Yes, they gave her
homework on the first day.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.210
- And math?

17:10.210 --> 17:11.810
I'm sorry.

17:11.810 --> 17:13.855
Well, I'm glad your brother can help you.

17:13.855 --> 17:15.575
Because you know momma can't.

17:15.575 --> 17:17.400
So where's dad.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.853
- I think he's in the garage.

17:19.853 --> 17:20.686
- Okay.

17:22.060 --> 17:23.533
- Okay.

17:23.533 --> 17:25.773
Now what haven't we memorized already?

17:25.773 --> 17:27.032
(dramatic music plays)

17:27.032 --> 17:31.532
(background music drowns other sound)

17:36.391 --> 17:38.308
- Jacob, wait a second.

17:39.851 --> 17:40.871
Where are you going?

17:40.871 --> 17:41.720
- I'm going out with Carson, Judy.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.754
- Well, what time will you be back?

17:43.754 --> 17:44.587
- I don't know, like an hour.

17:44.587 --> 17:45.513
- Wait a second.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.740
It's cold out there.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.490
Dinner is at six.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.155
- Six?

17:56.155 --> 17:57.995
- How about seven?

17:57.995 --> 18:02.995
(sighs)
(dramatic music plays)

18:58.791 --> 19:01.208
(wind blows)

19:02.913 --> 19:05.830
(students chatter)

19:33.280 --> 19:34.630
- Settle down, settle down.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.473
Well, good morning again.

19:37.473 --> 19:38.306
- [Students] Good morning.

19:38.306 --> 19:40.003
- So any thoughts on the play?

19:40.913 --> 19:43.108
(students chatter)

19:43.108 --> 19:43.941
All right.

19:43.941 --> 19:44.972
All right.

19:44.972 --> 19:47.409
What about something Kentucky?

19:47.409 --> 19:49.772
(students chatter)

19:49.772 --> 19:51.191
Okay guys, settle down.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.280
What about my West Virginia folks?

19:54.280 --> 19:55.490
Do you guys have any ideas?

19:55.490 --> 19:57.610
- How about a coal miner's daughter?

19:57.610 --> 19:58.443
(laughs)

19:58.443 --> 19:59.680
- Jacob.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.910
- Deliverance was filmed here, wasn't it?

20:01.910 --> 20:04.711
With your corn fields and straw hats?

20:04.711 --> 20:06.153
- All right, settle down.

20:06.153 --> 20:07.940
Settle down.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.550
Hey, listen guys.

20:09.550 --> 20:11.840
You've got to come up
with an idea for the play.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.276
I told you.

20:13.276 --> 20:14.540
I'm not going to make
that decision for you.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.290
If you guys don't come up with something,

20:16.290 --> 20:17.610
we're going to spend
the rest of the semester

20:17.610 --> 20:19.310
just cleaning this theater.

20:19.310 --> 20:20.650
And speaking of that,

20:20.650 --> 20:22.910
we still have quite a
bit of cleaning to do.

20:22.910 --> 20:25.060
So I'm going to break
you guys into groups.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.870
You three gentlemen, over here and Dex.

20:29.870 --> 20:32.210
You guys are going to help me up on stage.

20:32.210 --> 20:37.210
Then Maddie, Bri, and Olivia, you guys

20:40.770 --> 20:44.960
are going to go up top, do some
cleaning, sweep the floors.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.490
- Can my brother come with me?

20:47.490 --> 20:48.500
- Yeah, sure.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.910
That'd be fine.

20:49.910 --> 20:52.113
The rest of you let's
find something to do.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.560
Come on.

20:54.560 --> 20:55.778
Yes.

20:55.778 --> 20:56.611
(claps)

20:56.611 --> 20:57.444
Let's go.

20:57.444 --> 20:58.277
Let's go.

20:58.277 --> 20:59.480
Let's go.

20:59.480 --> 21:00.840
- What's up?

21:00.840 --> 21:02.370
- Nothing.

21:02.370 --> 21:03.203
- No, what's up.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.260
- I have another hearing.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.443
Another review hearing.

21:09.270 --> 21:11.140
Every so often I have to go before a judge

21:11.140 --> 21:13.160
to see if I'm in the right place,

21:13.160 --> 21:15.110
you know, with the right family.

21:15.110 --> 21:15.943
- Well, are you?

21:16.791 --> 21:17.841
- I mean, I guess so.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.620
- Dude, could they actually take you away?

21:20.620 --> 21:23.113
- If they really didn't want me, I guess.

21:24.027 --> 21:26.933
- Now, who wouldn't want you?

21:34.538 --> 21:36.538
(cries)

21:42.295 --> 21:43.550
- Hey, hey.

21:43.550 --> 21:44.420
- Hey.

21:44.420 --> 21:45.253
- What's wrong?

21:46.850 --> 21:47.900
- Nothing.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.583
- Come on, tell me.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.050
- I'm fine.

21:52.050 --> 21:52.883
- Come on.

21:53.836 --> 21:57.270
(soft music plays)

21:57.270 --> 22:02.270
- Last night, my mom overdosed, again.

22:05.690 --> 22:07.220
You know, for once, I wish

22:07.220 --> 22:08.720
she would just take care of me

22:09.615 --> 22:10.448
instead of taking care of herself.

22:10.448 --> 22:11.353
- Is she okay?

22:12.240 --> 22:13.700
- I'm sure she's fine.

22:13.700 --> 22:14.900
Just like she always is.

22:15.759 --> 22:20.300
- Well, I got another text
about a review hearing.

22:21.199 --> 22:22.495
I have another one.

22:22.495 --> 22:24.559
So I have that to look forward to.

22:24.559 --> 22:27.653
Hey, I'm sure your mom will be just fine.

22:29.018 --> 22:30.160
Come on.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.713
We've got to go clean this theater.

22:42.280 --> 22:43.343
- [Students] Hey.

22:50.156 --> 22:52.323
(mumbles)

23:02.120 --> 23:05.880
- Hey guys, I think this
lady invented Mother's Day.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.450
- I don't think so.

23:07.450 --> 23:08.743
- It says it right there.

23:09.670 --> 23:11.890
- Mother's day was
created in West Virginia.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.260
Everyone knows that.

23:13.260 --> 23:15.560
In fact Father's Day was too.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.340
- Kentucky legislator
recognized her as the originator

23:18.340 --> 23:19.173
of the idea.

23:19.173 --> 23:22.101
"Years later, they adopted
the second Sunday of May

23:22.101 --> 23:23.780
making that Mother's Day."

23:23.780 --> 23:24.930
May.

23:24.930 --> 23:27.182
Hey, that's when we have
to do a performance.

23:27.182 --> 23:28.188
- Oh.

23:28.188 --> 23:29.200
- We should do it on Mother's Day.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.580
- Like perform it on Mother's Day.

23:30.580 --> 23:31.413
- Well, why not?

23:31.413 --> 23:33.058
It's perfect.

23:33.058 --> 23:33.891
I mean, Kentucky basically
invented Mother's Day.

23:33.891 --> 23:35.233
- No it didn't.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.630
- It says it right there.

23:37.630 --> 23:38.463
- You're wrong.

23:38.463 --> 23:40.300
It's just another fake Kentucky lie.

23:40.300 --> 23:41.980
- It's not a lie.

23:41.980 --> 23:43.170
What is your deal?

23:43.170 --> 23:44.593
Seriously?

23:44.593 --> 23:45.426
Why are you so difficult?

23:45.426 --> 23:47.310
Why do you care?

23:47.310 --> 23:49.240
- We learned this in school, back at home.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.770
It was some lady named Jarvis.

23:51.770 --> 23:53.620
Look, we don't have much in West Virginia,

23:53.620 --> 23:54.929
but what we have, we keep.

23:54.929 --> 23:56.350
- Obviously.

23:56.350 --> 23:57.900
- Hey, hey, hey, what's going on here?

23:57.900 --> 23:59.660
- I was just cleaning this lady's plaque--

23:59.660 --> 24:02.670
She's trying to say that
Mother's Day was created here,

24:02.670 --> 24:03.590
but it wasn't.

24:03.590 --> 24:04.537
It was in West--

24:05.390 --> 24:06.570
(both shout)

24:06.570 --> 24:08.340
- Excuse me Mr. Thomas.

24:08.340 --> 24:11.090
I couldn't have been over
here this conversation.

24:11.090 --> 24:12.580
I know both of you disagree

24:12.580 --> 24:14.730
with how Mother's Day was invented,

24:14.730 --> 24:18.410
but you both are right
to a certain extent.

24:18.410 --> 24:20.920
Both West, Virginia and
Kentucky did play a part

24:20.920 --> 24:22.750
in the first Mother's Day.

24:22.750 --> 24:24.700
And I think that you
both would be surprised

24:24.700 --> 24:26.810
about those two pioneer women.

24:26.810 --> 24:29.170
They both had a lot in
common with each other.

24:29.170 --> 24:30.180
- Yeah.

24:30.180 --> 24:32.040
Ray is 100% correct.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.403
In fact, that gives me an idea.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.490
I think we should do a play

24:37.490 --> 24:39.993
about Mother's Day on Mother's Day.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.000
It'd be brilliant.

24:43.370 --> 24:47.534
We could call it "The
Story of Mother's Day."

24:47.534 --> 24:48.800
Yeah.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.170
I like that.

24:50.170 --> 24:51.003
Okay.

24:51.003 --> 24:52.696
As an assignment, you and you

24:52.696 --> 24:55.000
are both going to write the script

24:55.000 --> 24:59.176
and the rest of you guys can
get back to cleaning, please.

24:59.176 --> 25:02.990
I'm going to let the
class know we have a play.

25:02.990 --> 25:05.610
All right guys, go find a room,

25:05.610 --> 25:08.810
hug it out or whatever,
but get to writing.

25:08.810 --> 25:10.930
Because the sooner you give us a script,

25:10.930 --> 25:13.313
the sooner we can all stop being janitors.

25:14.630 --> 25:17.400
I mean it, go for real.

25:18.536 --> 25:21.619
(upbeat music plays)

25:42.830 --> 25:44.620
- You can go back to the theater.

25:44.620 --> 25:45.563
I won't be long.

25:51.260 --> 25:52.540
What?

25:52.540 --> 25:53.974
- Nothing.

25:53.974 --> 25:57.224
(dramatic music plays)

26:08.063 --> 26:09.293
What if we do a musical?

26:10.480 --> 26:13.000
- No, it needs to be a drama.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.650
An emotional drama is what I see.

26:26.940 --> 26:28.943
- Well, I want to be in it.

26:30.940 --> 26:32.340
- Cool.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.463
I don't, I hate acting.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.460
I want to direct it.

26:38.064 --> 26:38.897
- Okay.

26:42.241 --> 26:43.670
- You know, I wrote and directed

26:43.670 --> 26:45.930
the last two theater performances at home.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.303
So I know what I'm doing.

26:48.278 --> 26:49.111
- Okay.

26:49.111 --> 26:52.361
(dramatic music plays)

27:01.040 --> 27:03.210
How about we write two scripts.

27:03.210 --> 27:05.660
One from West Virginia and
the other one from Kentucky,

27:05.660 --> 27:07.257
then let the team decide.

27:07.257 --> 27:11.683
- I mean you have the home
foot advantage, but whatever.

27:12.630 --> 27:13.463
Best story wins?

27:15.737 --> 27:16.570
- Deal.

27:16.570 --> 27:19.487
(soft music plays)

27:27.975 --> 27:29.691
- So how'd it go?

27:29.691 --> 27:31.250
- You'll see Monday.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.083
- Cool.

27:34.491 --> 27:35.548
- What is he doing?

27:35.548 --> 27:37.135
- I don't know.

27:37.135 --> 27:39.220
- He's pretty good.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.053
- Yeah.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.743
- So how about that tour
of the town this weekend?

27:45.092 --> 27:47.090
- I have a play to write.

27:47.090 --> 27:48.700
- You know, some local attractions

27:48.700 --> 27:50.720
might help with your creativity.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.233
- You mean local distractions.

27:55.058 --> 27:56.620
- Oh.

27:56.620 --> 27:57.453
- I'll meet you.

28:03.090 --> 28:08.063
- That's a nice shade of black on black.

28:11.990 --> 28:12.823
Great job.

28:15.824 --> 28:18.074
(chatters)

28:20.526 --> 28:22.087
- Yeah, it was.

28:22.087 --> 28:23.106
- Shut up!

28:23.106 --> 28:23.939
(clears throat)

28:23.939 --> 28:24.772
- Let's pray.

28:27.490 --> 28:28.670
Dear heavenly father.

28:28.670 --> 28:30.053
Thank you for this day.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.750
Thank you for this food.

28:32.750 --> 28:35.100
We ask that you give us the strength

28:35.100 --> 28:37.663
and the wisdom to seek your will, amen.

28:38.570 --> 28:39.543
- [Sandra] Amen.

28:39.543 --> 28:40.376
That was a good one, dad.

28:40.376 --> 28:41.552
- Okay.

28:41.552 --> 28:42.385
Highlights of the day.

28:42.385 --> 28:45.790
- Well, mine really wasn't
the highlight of this day,

28:45.790 --> 28:47.712
but last night, guess what?

28:47.712 --> 28:48.710
- What?

28:48.710 --> 28:49.543
- Rascal slept with me.

28:49.543 --> 28:50.480
- Oh, he did?

28:50.480 --> 28:51.750
- He sure did.

28:51.750 --> 28:53.840
- How did you even get any sleep?

28:53.840 --> 28:54.673
- I don't know.

28:54.673 --> 28:55.947
He's so big, but he sleeps
at the end of the bed

28:55.947 --> 28:57.750
and it works so...

28:57.750 --> 28:59.580
- Well, my highlight was
I didn't get a wedgie

28:59.580 --> 29:01.963
but they still stole my lunch money.

29:01.963 --> 29:03.060
- [Judy] These kids.

29:03.060 --> 29:03.893
- Okay.

29:03.893 --> 29:05.670
Well, my highlight was getting a star

29:05.670 --> 29:07.519
for good work in Math class.

29:07.519 --> 29:09.721
- [Sandra] Good job.

29:09.721 --> 29:10.853
- [Paul] Good job, good job.

29:11.881 --> 29:12.714
- [Judy] That's great.

29:12.714 --> 29:15.076
- I was elected as class representative.

29:15.076 --> 29:17.326
(applause)

29:18.813 --> 29:20.613
- Excellent, excellent.

29:20.613 --> 29:21.446
- I'm proud of you.

29:21.446 --> 29:22.279
Jacob.

29:27.054 --> 29:29.760
- We have a new theater
play that we're going to do.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.986
I don't know what it is yet.

29:31.986 --> 29:34.400
And I have a girlfriend...

29:34.400 --> 29:39.400
A friend who I think is
going through some stuff

29:42.780 --> 29:45.090
- Jacob, what's her name?

29:45.090 --> 29:46.681
- Molly.

29:46.681 --> 29:48.217
- We'll pray for her.

29:53.678 --> 29:55.595
And Jacob, this review.

29:58.350 --> 30:00.170
You don't have anything to worry about.

30:00.170 --> 30:02.370
- If you guys don't want me
here, you can just tell me.

30:02.370 --> 30:03.203
- Jacob.

30:04.690 --> 30:09.430
Mom, dad, what's going on?

30:09.430 --> 30:10.263
What's a...

30:10.263 --> 30:11.096
What review?

30:12.880 --> 30:13.810
- We'll tell you later.

30:13.810 --> 30:14.660
Go ahead and eat.

30:21.742 --> 30:24.825
(somber music plays)

30:56.573 --> 31:00.490
- You know, I wish we
went to church more often.

31:00.490 --> 31:01.463
What do you think?

31:03.674 --> 31:04.507
- I guess.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.748
- I remember, we're volunteering at this

31:08.748 --> 31:12.780
small group outreach and I
didn't really want to go.

31:12.780 --> 31:16.163
But Paul insisted, I think
he wanted to make deacon.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.210
And then there you were.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.490
And I knew...

31:20.490 --> 31:22.840
I knew at that moment
you were going to be part

31:24.133 --> 31:25.300
of our family.

31:26.509 --> 31:28.554
- I always thought I was too much.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.674
(laughs)

31:29.674 --> 31:31.309
- You are too much.

31:31.309 --> 31:33.359
But I wouldn't change one thing about you

31:34.320 --> 31:37.354
and listen this review.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.810
Don't worry about it.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.220
Okay?

31:41.220 --> 31:42.913
You're not going anywhere.

31:44.373 --> 31:46.090
(sniffs)

31:46.090 --> 31:49.007
(soft music plays)

31:52.611 --> 31:54.778
(mumbles)

32:02.150 --> 32:03.453
- Dex, come here.

32:03.453 --> 32:04.537
Come here son.

32:04.537 --> 32:05.370
Son.

32:05.370 --> 32:08.287
(soft music plays)

32:29.905 --> 32:30.960
- I can see you found the place.

32:30.960 --> 32:31.880
- It's a small town.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.240
It wasn't that hard to find.

32:33.240 --> 32:36.410
- Well, small towns have a
lot of history, you know?

32:36.410 --> 32:37.828
- Really?

32:37.828 --> 32:38.661
Like what?

32:38.661 --> 32:41.580
- Well, take this park, for instance.

32:41.580 --> 32:43.470
It's over 200 years old

32:43.470 --> 32:46.665
making it one of the oldest
central parks in America.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.083
Come on, I'll show you some more.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.446
All right.

32:57.446 --> 32:59.060
Now look at this.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.660
- It's a library.

33:00.660 --> 33:02.430
- Not just any library.

33:02.430 --> 33:04.690
The money donated for
the library was donated

33:04.690 --> 33:06.920
by that old billionaire guy.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.430
Carney, you know the steel guy.

33:09.430 --> 33:11.380
- You mean Carnegie.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.483
- Yeah, I've heard it both ways.

33:14.370 --> 33:15.711
All right, let's go.

33:15.711 --> 33:18.794
(upbeat music plays)

33:58.244 --> 34:01.260
So it's the old train station.

34:01.260 --> 34:04.244
Well, it's a replica, obviously.

34:04.244 --> 34:07.700
The original was something
big back in the day

34:07.700 --> 34:09.547
or at least something like that.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.720
And the caboose is actually
from that train yard.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.052
And--

34:14.052 --> 34:15.284
- What are you?

34:15.284 --> 34:16.667
Some walking Encyclopedia?

34:16.667 --> 34:17.500
- What?

34:17.500 --> 34:18.333
I just liked my town.

34:18.333 --> 34:19.483
- I was joking, Carson.

34:22.510 --> 34:24.393
- So are you close to your brother?

34:25.350 --> 34:26.690
- Yeah.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.600
What about you and your
brothers or sisters?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.213
- No, I'm an only child.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.110
Do you like theater?

34:33.110 --> 34:36.160
Yeah, I've been doing it my whole life.

34:36.160 --> 34:36.993
What about you?

34:37.910 --> 34:39.957
- I had some friends that were doing it,

34:39.957 --> 34:40.993
so thought I'd tag along.

34:42.344 --> 34:43.177
- That's cool.

34:43.177 --> 34:45.173
- So how is the play going?

34:46.800 --> 34:49.570
- Honestly, not so good.

34:49.570 --> 34:51.900
It's hard to write a
play about Mother's Day

34:51.900 --> 34:54.800
when you don't have a mom.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.580
My parents died last year.

34:56.580 --> 34:59.156
My brother and I live with my aunt.

34:59.156 --> 35:04.156
- Well, you do have a
mother she's just not here.

35:05.110 --> 35:07.040
Like I have a father.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.463
I just haven't seen him in three years.

35:11.780 --> 35:13.122
All right.

35:13.122 --> 35:14.904
There's one more place I want to take you.

35:14.904 --> 35:17.987
(upbeat music plays)

35:38.350 --> 35:40.283
- My mom would have loved this.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.360
You know, other than hand made cards,

35:44.360 --> 35:47.240
I don't think she ever got
her real Mother's Day gift,

35:47.240 --> 35:48.073
ever.

35:50.710 --> 35:52.300
The dance factory.

35:52.300 --> 35:53.997
Is that a dance studio?

35:53.997 --> 35:55.336
- Yeah.

35:55.336 --> 35:56.243
- Let's go look.

36:11.298 --> 36:14.631
(classical music plays)

36:35.250 --> 36:37.580
I used to take dance when I was younger.

36:37.580 --> 36:39.013
I loved it.

36:39.997 --> 36:41.950
And this place looks really cool.

36:41.950 --> 36:42.820
- Yeah.

36:42.820 --> 36:44.380
It's nice.

36:44.380 --> 36:45.960
I used to come here a
lot when I was younger.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.070
- You used to say dance lessons?

36:48.070 --> 36:51.150
- No, I went to mixed martial arts.

36:51.150 --> 36:52.860
- Seriously?

36:52.860 --> 36:55.530
I'm even more surprised
that you took TaeKwonDo.

36:55.530 --> 36:56.851
- Really?

36:56.851 --> 37:00.101
(dramatic music plays)

37:07.289 --> 37:09.160
- Look, Carson, I got to go.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.456
- Okay.

37:10.456 --> 37:12.300
I'll see you at school?

37:12.300 --> 37:13.370
- Yeah.

37:13.370 --> 37:15.416
Thanks for showing me around town.

37:15.416 --> 37:17.471
- Yeah, no problem.

37:17.471 --> 37:20.804
(classical music plays)

37:30.850 --> 37:35.850
(cheeky music plays)
(keyboard clicks)

39:02.320 --> 39:05.623
- Hey, I got you something.

39:06.829 --> 39:08.680
Listen, I know it's hard.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.580
Maybe that'll be a little inspiration.

39:17.090 --> 39:20.007
(soft music plays)

39:47.787 --> 39:49.090
- No, Dr. Stone, I understand.

39:49.090 --> 39:50.189
I absolutely do.

39:50.189 --> 39:51.950
No, it's just that these
kids been working their tails

39:51.950 --> 39:53.730
off for this performance.

39:53.730 --> 39:54.563
Yes, sir.

39:54.563 --> 39:57.340
And they haven't been able
to perform in over a year.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.723
Is there no way at all
we can find the funds?

40:02.808 --> 40:03.803
Yes, sir.

40:05.448 --> 40:08.910
I, I, there's no way whatso...

40:08.910 --> 40:10.820
There's no leeway anywhere in the budget

40:10.820 --> 40:11.720
that you can find?

40:13.048 --> 40:15.430
And I'm not, I'm not--

40:15.430 --> 40:16.263
Correct.

40:16.263 --> 40:17.096
Okay, sir.

40:17.096 --> 40:18.260
I understand.

40:18.260 --> 40:19.714
No, I'm just...

40:19.714 --> 40:21.373
I'm trying to the best for our kids

40:21.373 --> 40:23.790
and we'll keep looking
for alternative ways.

40:23.790 --> 40:24.623
Thank you, sir.

40:27.609 --> 40:30.526
(students chatter)

40:40.111 --> 40:42.160
- Hey, is everything okay?

40:42.160 --> 40:42.993
- I'm fine.

40:45.643 --> 40:46.476
- Okay.

40:46.476 --> 40:48.350
So he left a note.

40:48.350 --> 40:50.180
I'm in my office, please work together

40:50.180 --> 40:52.500
and decide on a performance
by the end of class.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.333
And let me know.

40:54.190 --> 40:55.200
You all ready?

40:55.200 --> 40:56.033
- Yes we are.

40:57.319 --> 41:00.620
So Olivia and I had prepared
two separate scripts

41:00.620 --> 41:03.040
for you guys today and
we're going to present them.

41:03.040 --> 41:06.135
And then you all will
decide as a team and whoever

41:06.135 --> 41:08.052
is the best will win.

41:08.052 --> 41:09.690
You ready?

41:09.690 --> 41:11.079
- Yeah.

41:11.079 --> 41:12.540
- Go ahead.

41:12.540 --> 41:14.640
- I propose this year
with perform a celebration

41:14.640 --> 41:18.760
on Mother's Day in a play I'm
calling "The Second Sunday."

41:18.760 --> 41:20.870
You see, it was The second Sunday of May

41:20.870 --> 41:24.210
that a West Virginia lady
named Anna Maria Jarvis

41:24.210 --> 41:27.313
founded Mother's Day in
the United States in 1914.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.230
I propose we tell her
story on how she heard

41:30.230 --> 41:32.710
of smaller school Mother's Day gatherings

41:32.710 --> 41:35.210
but it was her, Anna Jarvis,
that led the movement

41:35.210 --> 41:37.370
to make it a national holiday.

41:37.370 --> 41:39.470
We can tell her story
on how she grew up poor,

41:39.470 --> 41:42.680
was a school teacher, and
how she adored her mother.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.300
Also how she named the Carnation,

41:44.300 --> 41:46.020
the official flower a Mother's Day

41:46.020 --> 41:47.370
since it's petals do not drop

41:47.370 --> 41:49.698
and how they're hugged to the heart

41:49.698 --> 41:52.476
of the flower to represent
the enduring love of a mother.

41:52.476 --> 41:54.630
We can show the economic advancements

41:54.630 --> 41:56.730
she pioneered in creating Mother's Day,

41:56.730 --> 41:59.350
our antagonist of the story
will be her political struggles

41:59.350 --> 42:03.010
she endured, and in closing
and my favorite part,

42:03.010 --> 42:04.647
it turned her crazy.

42:04.647 --> 42:07.210
She died broke, and in an insane asylum

42:07.210 --> 42:10.730
paid for by the greeting
card manufacturers.

42:10.730 --> 42:11.916
Thank you.

42:11.916 --> 42:12.749
(coughs)

42:12.749 --> 42:15.499
(crowd applauds)

42:18.220 --> 42:20.810
- If you all, please
look under your chairs.

42:20.810 --> 42:23.842
I provided a full report
of my presentation today.

42:23.842 --> 42:26.673
If you will turn to
page one, we will begin.

42:29.010 --> 42:31.830
Mary Towles Sassoon Wilson,

42:31.830 --> 42:34.050
a name that adorns our very own theatre,

42:34.050 --> 42:37.520
was the originator and
creator of Mother's Day.

42:37.520 --> 42:39.640
Now, history does confirm
that a West Virginian woman

42:39.640 --> 42:41.920
named Anna Jarvis was the
catalyst and the effort

42:41.920 --> 42:44.350
to organize Mother's Day as a holiday,

42:44.350 --> 42:46.710
but it was the Mary that planted the seeds

42:46.710 --> 42:49.830
for a nationally recognized
holiday, Mother's Day.

42:49.830 --> 42:51.963
Long before Jarvis even had a mother.

42:51.963 --> 42:52.796
(laughs)

42:52.796 --> 42:55.707
I call my play, "Something about Mary."

42:57.250 --> 42:58.370
If you'll read in your report,

42:58.370 --> 43:01.070
you will see Mary was
also a school teacher.

43:01.070 --> 43:04.210
She also invented the first
ever Mother's Day card.

43:04.210 --> 43:08.920
It was 32 pages long, but
still, the first card ever.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.430
I want to create a musical,

43:10.430 --> 43:13.344
a momtastic approach to
this wonderful holiday.

43:13.344 --> 43:16.033
Please vote for my story.

43:17.370 --> 43:18.907
Thank you.

43:18.907 --> 43:21.657
(crowd applauds)

43:22.610 --> 43:23.443
- Okay.

43:23.443 --> 43:25.050
So do we even really need a vote?

43:25.050 --> 43:27.020
I mean, both are so similar.

43:27.020 --> 43:29.610
Love their mothers, school teacher, poor,

43:29.610 --> 43:34.610
and I don't know about you,
but that seems perfect.

43:34.720 --> 43:37.035
And don't look at me like that.

43:37.035 --> 43:39.440
- I really liked both approaches too.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.880
Especially the part
about the insane asylum.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.300
And I can be be the clown.

43:43.300 --> 43:44.600
- What clown?

43:44.600 --> 43:47.371
- There's always a clown
in the insane asylum.

43:47.371 --> 43:48.204
(laughs)

43:48.204 --> 43:51.110
- Look, this is due today
and Mother's Day is perfect.

43:51.110 --> 43:52.893
So can you all work this out?

43:54.575 --> 43:55.612
- [Boy] Come on, it's not that hard.

43:55.612 --> 43:56.871
- [Boy] I think we got it.

43:56.871 --> 43:58.914
(chatters)

43:58.914 --> 43:59.864
- So is that a yes?

44:03.660 --> 44:04.493
- Sure.

44:05.730 --> 44:06.910
- Fine.

44:06.910 --> 44:08.351
- We got a play.

44:08.351 --> 44:10.601
(applauds)

44:11.580 --> 44:12.980
- So what do we have?

44:12.980 --> 44:15.840
So if we start with
very grassroots efforts

44:15.840 --> 44:18.090
in the 1890s we conclude

44:18.090 --> 44:19.920
with Anna Jarvis getting Mother's Day

44:19.920 --> 44:22.310
as a national holiday in 1914.

44:22.310 --> 44:23.788
Sound good?

44:23.788 --> 44:24.991
- Sounds perfect.

44:24.991 --> 44:26.583
Now, should I play Mary or Anna?

44:29.588 --> 44:32.400
- You know, you're not such bad writer.

44:32.400 --> 44:34.133
- I do enjoy the writing part.

44:35.290 --> 44:36.523
- Okay.

44:36.523 --> 44:37.640
What about music?

44:37.640 --> 44:39.080
- We don't have a whole lot of time.

44:39.080 --> 44:40.900
Maybe a couple of mother theme songs

44:40.900 --> 44:43.550
but not the wind beneath my wings crap.

44:43.550 --> 44:44.383
- Okay.

44:44.383 --> 44:45.216
Sounds fair.

44:47.230 --> 44:49.163
- You live here with your mom and dad?

44:50.060 --> 44:50.893
- Yeah.

44:53.460 --> 44:54.880
- My brother sings.

44:54.880 --> 44:55.713
- What?

44:55.713 --> 44:57.040
- My brother, Maddox.

44:57.040 --> 44:57.873
He sings.

44:59.430 --> 45:00.540
- Hey, that's great.

45:00.540 --> 45:02.240
He should sing in the play.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.380
- I mean, I can try, but I
don't know if he'd want...

45:04.380 --> 45:06.313
- I mean it wouldn't hurt, right?

45:10.150 --> 45:10.983
- Okay.

45:10.983 --> 45:14.460
So with your opening and my
closing, merging those stories

45:14.460 --> 45:18.020
and characters, that's about 15 pages.

45:18.020 --> 45:21.130
Add a song or two it's only 30 minutes.

45:21.130 --> 45:22.356
- Okay.

45:22.356 --> 45:23.189
Well it's short and sweet.

45:24.155 --> 45:25.955
- 30 minutes is a sit-com not a play

45:31.057 --> 45:32.120
You know, Mother's Day.

45:32.120 --> 45:35.070
Now we give them flowers cards,

45:35.070 --> 45:39.570
go to lunch or dinner back
then they didn't do that.

45:39.570 --> 45:42.713
You said you wanted
more momtastic approach.

45:44.050 --> 45:45.410
I have an idea.

45:45.410 --> 45:46.243
- Okay.

45:47.170 --> 45:48.189
- Okay.

45:48.189 --> 45:49.634
So we can do this.

45:49.634 --> 45:50.670
- Up here?

45:50.670 --> 45:53.289
- But it has to be here.

45:53.289 --> 45:54.889
- [Children] Grandma.

45:54.889 --> 45:56.067
- Kids.

45:56.067 --> 45:57.090
(coughs)

45:57.090 --> 45:58.588
Timmy and Jenny.

45:58.588 --> 46:01.930
Oh, Dana.

46:01.930 --> 46:04.451
I'm so glad to see all of you.

46:04.451 --> 46:05.893
- It's so good to see you, mom.

46:07.551 --> 46:10.230
- And you brought me flowers.

46:11.507 --> 46:14.190
I'm not dead yet.

46:14.190 --> 46:15.450
- Mom.

46:15.450 --> 46:17.730
- We really miss you, grandma.

46:17.730 --> 46:21.510
- I missed you too, Timmy
and Jenny, the sweet face.

46:21.510 --> 46:25.053
Oh, I'm so glad to see all of you.

46:26.787 --> 46:29.704
(soft music plays)

46:32.262 --> 46:33.095
- [Ms. Hendricks] Good morning David.

46:33.095 --> 46:35.182
- [David] Good morning Ms. Hendricks.

46:35.182 --> 46:36.483
- [Man] Take it easy with that arm though.

46:37.502 --> 46:38.644
- [David] I will.

46:38.644 --> 46:39.999
It still bothers me a little,

46:39.999 --> 46:41.905
but the doctor said it
would be okay in a few days.

46:41.905 --> 46:42.738
- [Man] Good.

46:42.738 --> 46:43.585
Could take the sling off,

46:43.585 --> 46:45.262
but it's more comfortable this way.

46:45.262 --> 46:46.095
I'll be in touch with you.

46:46.095 --> 46:49.678
- [David] Good, I'll
wait to hear from you.

46:52.489 --> 46:55.156
(thunder claps)

48:02.343 --> 48:05.260
(students chatter)

48:06.940 --> 48:08.964
- And then they said, oh,
you know, Jabber Walkie.

48:08.964 --> 48:10.841
He isn't just a fictional
character anymore.

48:10.841 --> 48:12.110
It's actually a whole crew.

48:12.110 --> 48:14.543
- Yeah, well you would know.

48:14.543 --> 48:16.597
- Hey Clive, what can I do for you?

48:16.597 --> 48:20.050
- Hey, I'm sorry to keep
bothering you and asking this

48:20.050 --> 48:24.898
but kind of any luck
getting money for the play?

48:24.898 --> 48:26.480
- No, I haven't.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.780
I literally have tried everywhere.

48:28.780 --> 48:30.040
I called the superintendent.

48:30.040 --> 48:32.119
I talked to the school board.

48:32.119 --> 48:33.501
There is nothing anywhere.

48:33.501 --> 48:34.810
And I'm sorry I tried
everything I could, but--

48:34.810 --> 48:37.000
- But I'm supposed to
literally meet with the girls

48:37.000 --> 48:38.950
right now about the play.

48:38.950 --> 48:40.140
How am I supposed to tell
them that it's another year

48:40.140 --> 48:41.460
without a play?

48:41.460 --> 48:42.820
- Clive, you're not the only department

48:42.820 --> 48:44.170
that has had this problem at all.

48:44.170 --> 48:45.480
We've cut from every department.

48:45.480 --> 48:46.930
I'm sorry.

48:46.930 --> 48:48.930
There's nothing I can do

48:51.640 --> 48:52.883
- Have a good day everybody.

48:54.230 --> 48:57.020
- He takes it so personally,
but there's nothing.

48:57.020 --> 48:57.853
We've all cut.

49:06.890 --> 49:07.723
- That's good.

49:08.610 --> 49:10.973
It's a little light.

49:12.260 --> 49:15.020
I did notice the ending
just says "Finale."

49:15.020 --> 49:18.570
- We're going to let our
creative juices rest right now.

49:18.570 --> 49:19.690
- Okay.

49:19.690 --> 49:20.740
Well who's directing?

49:21.911 --> 49:22.910
- Olivia is.

49:22.910 --> 49:26.350
- And I see you have already casted.

49:26.350 --> 49:27.353
Well, that's great.

49:27.353 --> 49:28.533
Good work ladies.

49:29.411 --> 49:33.363
You probably better get to
work on having some pages here.

49:36.850 --> 49:38.314
Just one other thing

49:38.314 --> 49:43.314
if you would hold off on all
of the set design, please.

49:43.390 --> 49:44.490
- Yeah.

49:44.490 --> 49:45.460
- Well you only got a few weeks left

49:45.460 --> 49:47.270
so you guys better get to writing.

49:47.270 --> 49:48.103
- Thank you.

49:48.103 --> 49:48.936
- Thank you.

49:48.936 --> 49:49.973
All right, ladies.

49:59.633 --> 50:02.550
(students chatter)

50:16.760 --> 50:17.593
- Okay.

50:17.593 --> 50:20.690
We have decided a role and
a job for the entire class

50:20.690 --> 50:24.530
but we only have nine weeks,
so we cannot argue about it.

50:24.530 --> 50:25.960
So no complaining.

50:25.960 --> 50:26.830
Okay?

50:26.830 --> 50:28.852
The theater is a team effort.

50:28.852 --> 50:31.030
- Then that means that you're the lead.

50:31.030 --> 50:34.510
- No, I'm the co-lead with Molly.

50:34.510 --> 50:36.650
- Let's not forget what
the great theater performer

50:36.650 --> 50:38.793
Zac Efron once said.

50:38.793 --> 50:41.972
♪ We're all in this together ♪

50:41.972 --> 50:42.969
- Okay.

50:42.969 --> 50:46.027
- Hi, I'm Woodrow Wilson.

50:46.027 --> 50:48.983
- I'm Senator Henry Moore Teller.

50:50.490 --> 50:51.323
- Seriously?

50:51.323 --> 50:52.550
I'm student number one.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.350
- Oh, I'm student number four.

50:54.350 --> 50:56.703
- Student number seven over here.

50:56.703 --> 50:58.653
- Ooh. I get to play Anna Jarvis's mom.

51:00.250 --> 51:02.033
Wait, doesn't she die?

51:03.600 --> 51:05.020
- Wait, what about the ending?

51:05.020 --> 51:07.880
You have a finale, but nothing's written.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.520
We're still working on that.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.290
- There's nothing in
here about set design.

51:11.290 --> 51:12.223
- Or wardrobe.

51:13.151 --> 51:14.567
- Mr. Thomas asked us to wait

51:14.567 --> 51:15.951
on those until everything gets finished.

51:15.951 --> 51:17.087
So...

51:17.087 --> 51:17.920
- Well, my character
doesn't even have a line.

51:19.231 --> 51:22.660
- Hey guys, guys, the
theater is a team effort.

51:22.660 --> 51:23.530
Come on.

51:23.530 --> 51:24.363
Let's go.

51:25.268 --> 51:26.101
Come on.

51:26.101 --> 51:29.284
(upbeat music plays)

51:29.284 --> 51:30.560
- Don't worry about it.

51:30.560 --> 51:31.739
It's under control.

51:31.739 --> 51:34.822
(upbeat music plays)

52:13.560 --> 52:14.710
- Hello class.

52:14.710 --> 52:16.639
My name is Ms. Towels,

52:16.639 --> 52:18.990
and I will be your theater teacher today.

52:18.990 --> 52:19.950
Theater teacher.

52:19.950 --> 52:21.516
I'm sorry.

52:21.516 --> 52:22.349
Do you want me to do it again?

52:23.279 --> 52:24.536
- No, that's perfect.

52:24.536 --> 52:25.369
That's a cut on rehearsal.

52:25.369 --> 52:26.425
Good job everyone.

52:26.425 --> 52:27.428
(phone rings)

52:27.428 --> 52:28.560
- Was great.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.610
- [Carson] How was I?

52:33.550 --> 52:35.749
- Mom, don't call me when you're...

52:35.749 --> 52:40.640
(background noise drowns out other sounds)

52:40.640 --> 52:42.100
- Shut up, Maddie.

52:42.100 --> 52:43.560
You don't know what's going on.

52:43.560 --> 52:45.220
Her mom is addicted to pain meds.

52:45.220 --> 52:46.510
It's not her fault.

52:46.510 --> 52:48.763
- I didn't say anything about--

52:48.763 --> 52:50.179
- It's not like you can keep
your mom out of a bottle.

52:50.179 --> 52:51.012
- Jacob.

52:51.012 --> 52:52.618
- At least I have a mom.

52:52.618 --> 52:53.900
- Guys, guys, hod on.

52:53.900 --> 52:55.750
This is supposed to be
about celebrating mothers.

52:55.750 --> 52:58.450
Not tearing them down and
certainly not tearing us down.

52:58.450 --> 53:00.000
- Well at least they're alive.

53:00.000 --> 53:00.833
- Maddox.

53:00.833 --> 53:02.110
- What!

53:02.110 --> 53:02.943
- Maddox.

53:02.943 --> 53:03.776
- No.

53:03.776 --> 53:04.609
- Maddox.

53:04.609 --> 53:05.442
- No.

53:08.970 --> 53:10.303
- All right guys.

53:10.303 --> 53:11.136
Have a seat, please.

53:13.010 --> 53:14.560
I have an announcement to make.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.793
Listen, I've been trying to find a way to

53:21.793 --> 53:26.010
tell you guys this, but
a play has been canceled.

53:26.010 --> 53:27.370
- [Students] What?

53:27.370 --> 53:29.080
- Listen, listen.

53:29.080 --> 53:30.500
I know you guys are disappointed.

53:30.500 --> 53:32.270
I'm just as disappointed as you are.

53:32.270 --> 53:36.570
But unfortunately the school
budget just doesn't allow

53:36.570 --> 53:38.220
for a production this year.

53:38.220 --> 53:40.500
Now I've been working with
principal Ellis for weeks

53:40.500 --> 53:41.810
trying to find an alternative

53:41.810 --> 53:44.780
but culverts put such a
strain on the school's budget.

53:44.780 --> 53:47.514
That money just isn't there.

53:47.514 --> 53:48.850
- But the play is in a few days.

53:48.850 --> 53:49.790
- I know.

53:49.790 --> 53:52.640
And I know you guys
have worked really hard

53:52.640 --> 53:57.640
on this, but I'm sorry, I'm
going to giving you guys just

53:58.540 --> 54:01.260
a few minutes to kind of let this process

54:01.260 --> 54:04.443
and then I'll see you
guys in class tomorrow.

54:05.289 --> 54:09.563
I'm really, really sorry.

54:25.955 --> 54:28.410
- [Anne Voiceovers] I'm
going to sign you up

54:28.410 --> 54:32.293
for two semesters of Latin
and French that should get you

54:32.293 --> 54:33.649
to the end of the year.

54:33.649 --> 54:35.517
- [Madison Voiceovers] But
why are you doing this?

54:35.517 --> 54:38.409
- [Anne Voiceovers] Honey,
economics is pretty simple.

54:38.409 --> 54:40.360
You hire people to do things for you.

54:40.360 --> 54:44.893
And the theater, well the theater is dead.

54:46.785 --> 54:49.585
- [Madison Voiceovers]
Mom that's not fair.

54:49.585 --> 54:51.847
- [Anne Voiceovers] Well, life's not fair.

54:51.847 --> 54:54.764
(soft music plays)

55:12.720 --> 55:14.260
- So you thought that was the best time

55:14.260 --> 55:16.110
to speak your first words?

55:16.110 --> 55:17.890
- I'm just keeping it real, Liv.

55:17.890 --> 55:19.240
- What does that even mean?

55:20.546 --> 55:22.730
- I mean, you have been so preoccupied

55:22.730 --> 55:24.620
running around with your stupid theater.

55:24.620 --> 55:25.453
So I just wanted--

55:25.453 --> 55:28.530
- You just wanted to make sure
I didn't forget about you.

55:28.530 --> 55:29.510
What's the last scene you go

55:29.510 --> 55:31.661
into every production production?

55:31.661 --> 55:32.494
- What production Olivia?

55:32.494 --> 55:34.320
There's not going to be a production.

55:35.521 --> 55:37.060
- Yes there is Mr.Thomas will find a way.

55:37.060 --> 55:37.893
I know it.

55:39.040 --> 55:40.310
Here's the script.

55:40.310 --> 55:41.570
You see it in action.

55:41.570 --> 55:43.470
Now compose it.

55:43.470 --> 55:45.619
- I can do what else with my time.

55:45.619 --> 55:47.437
- What else do you have to do?

55:47.437 --> 55:50.354
(soft music plays)

56:51.379 --> 56:52.260
- What?

56:52.260 --> 56:54.263
- Do you remember when I got this for you?

56:55.680 --> 56:56.513
- No.

56:57.857 --> 56:59.593
- Okay.

57:02.540 --> 57:04.127
So how's school?

57:10.050 --> 57:11.400
- It's fine, I guess.

57:11.400 --> 57:12.700
- You guess?

57:12.700 --> 57:13.533
What's going on?

57:15.230 --> 57:16.330
- What are you doing?

57:16.330 --> 57:17.875
- Nothing.

57:17.875 --> 57:19.620
I just wanted to see
how, how school's going.

57:19.620 --> 57:21.070
How, how things are with you.

57:21.912 --> 57:23.032
How are your friends?

57:23.032 --> 57:23.949
How's life?

57:25.510 --> 57:28.900
- Mom, I didn't tell you this before

57:28.900 --> 57:31.570
because I know you don't
support it or whatever

57:31.570 --> 57:34.820
but I kept my classes the way they were

57:34.820 --> 57:36.640
so that I could stay in theater.

57:36.640 --> 57:38.920
- What you're saying you lied to me?

57:38.920 --> 57:43.920
- I'm sorry, mom, but I love
theater and I love my friends

57:44.493 --> 57:47.030
and I do everything you ask me to do

57:47.030 --> 57:48.850
because I know you only
want the best for me

57:48.850 --> 57:52.250
but acting is my passion mom.

57:52.250 --> 57:55.417
And I know you don't understand,

57:55.417 --> 57:57.590
but it means everything to me.

57:57.590 --> 58:01.010
- Madison, Maddie...

58:07.992 --> 58:09.409
Honey, I'm sorry.

58:12.171 --> 58:13.004
I just--

58:14.270 --> 58:17.993
- It doesn't matter anyway,
our show is canceled.

58:18.915 --> 58:20.853
Theater class is ruined.

58:22.470 --> 58:23.610
I'll just go back to Latin.

58:23.610 --> 58:25.120
Like you wanted in the first place.

58:25.120 --> 58:26.890
- What do you mean the show's canceled?

58:26.890 --> 58:27.723
What's going on?

58:29.010 --> 58:31.250
- Apparently there's no
money in the school budget

58:31.250 --> 58:33.162
for the theater department.

58:33.162 --> 58:34.713
So it's all over.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.093
No play again this year.

58:41.209 --> 58:42.300
- Oh, honey.

58:42.300 --> 58:43.150
- It's not fair, mom.

58:43.150 --> 58:44.922
It's just not fair.

58:44.922 --> 58:46.172
- I know honey.

58:50.190 --> 58:52.360
- [Man] What level of drug
use goes on in this house?

58:52.360 --> 58:54.740
- [Mom] Well, I have prescription drugs,

58:54.740 --> 58:55.990
they're prescribed to me.

58:56.846 --> 58:57.679
- Is this your house ma'am?

58:57.679 --> 58:58.512
- Yes, sir.

58:58.512 --> 58:59.490
- We're talking to your mom for a second.

58:59.490 --> 59:00.761
Everything's okay.

59:00.761 --> 59:01.594
We're just talking to her.

59:01.594 --> 59:02.427
- Is she okay?

59:02.427 --> 59:03.564
- Yes, she's okay.

59:03.564 --> 59:05.731
We're just talking to her.

59:11.370 --> 59:12.410
- Mom?

59:12.410 --> 59:13.400
- Honey, it's fine.

59:13.400 --> 59:15.695
Somebody called and said there were drugs

59:15.695 --> 59:17.410
but they're prescription drugs,
they're prescribed to me.

59:17.410 --> 59:19.090
- Mom, this is our home.

59:19.090 --> 59:20.880
- Honey, it's going to be fine.

59:20.880 --> 59:24.357
- If you need to help you
could have just said something.

59:47.204 --> 59:50.121
- I'm so sorry, she didn't make it.

59:52.055 --> 59:54.305
(sniffles)

1:00:04.703 --> 1:00:06.953
- It's grandma, she's gone.

1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:25.190
- Robert, it's Anne.

1:00:25.190 --> 1:00:26.850
I'm calling about your
school's theater program

1:00:26.850 --> 1:00:28.633
and the play that they want to put on.

1:00:31.305 --> 1:00:33.722
(foot steps)

1:00:35.604 --> 1:00:37.225
- Good morning class.

1:00:37.225 --> 1:00:38.100
- [Students] Good morning.

1:00:38.100 --> 1:00:40.600
- Sorry to tell you, Mr.
Thomas won't be in today.

1:00:41.444 --> 1:00:44.324
His mother passed away last night.

1:00:44.324 --> 1:00:47.465
We don't know any of the details just yet.

1:00:47.465 --> 1:00:49.270
Sorry to tell you guys this.

1:00:49.270 --> 1:00:51.903
I know you care an awful lot about him.

1:00:51.903 --> 1:00:54.730
- Well, this is just great
first our play's canceled.

1:00:54.730 --> 1:00:56.518
And now this.

1:00:56.518 --> 1:00:57.351
Poor Mr. Thomas.

1:00:57.351 --> 1:00:58.750
- He did have an announcement
he wanted me to share

1:00:58.750 --> 1:01:01.086
with you guys about your play.

1:01:01.086 --> 1:01:03.800
(students chatter)

1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:04.633
- It's on.

1:01:05.991 --> 1:01:08.680
(laughs)

1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:10.430
- But how is that possible?

1:01:10.430 --> 1:01:13.130
- There was an anonymous
benefactor who donated the money.

1:01:13.130 --> 1:01:14.363
So the play is on.

1:01:15.390 --> 1:01:17.506
- Like for real?

1:01:17.506 --> 1:01:18.506
- 100%?

1:01:19.762 --> 1:01:20.933
- For real you get to perform.

1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:21.810
Make sure each of the
motors are getting a flower

1:02:21.810 --> 1:02:24.460
and that they are seated
in the right-hand corner

1:02:24.460 --> 1:02:25.658
at the front.

1:02:25.658 --> 1:02:26.491
They know who they are.

1:02:26.491 --> 1:02:27.324
Do you need more flyers?

1:02:27.324 --> 1:02:28.157
Anymore flowers?

1:02:28.157 --> 1:02:28.990
- We have to hurry.

1:02:28.990 --> 1:02:29.823
We'll be okay.

1:02:29.823 --> 1:02:30.656
Just take a deep breath.

1:02:30.656 --> 1:02:31.489
- Okay.

1:02:31.489 --> 1:02:33.219
- You got this.

1:02:33.219 --> 1:02:34.052
- You're going to love it, I promise.

1:02:34.052 --> 1:02:35.640
You're going to love it.

1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:36.680
Happy Mother's Day.

1:02:36.680 --> 1:02:37.513
Hi, welcome.

1:02:37.513 --> 1:02:38.346
You're going to love it.

1:02:38.346 --> 1:02:39.960
Happy Mother's Day.

1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:40.793
Hi, welcome.

1:02:40.793 --> 1:02:41.710
Happy Mother's Day.

1:02:41.710 --> 1:02:42.543
You're going to love it.

1:02:42.543 --> 1:02:43.393
I promise.

1:02:44.250 --> 1:02:45.114
Hi, welcome happy Mother's Day.

1:02:45.114 --> 1:02:47.864
(people chatter)

1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:52.273
- What was that?

1:02:52.273 --> 1:02:53.106
"Happy Mother's Day?"

1:02:53.106 --> 1:02:55.310
You're telling me Lady
of darkness has a mood

1:02:55.310 --> 1:02:56.403
other than gloom.

1:02:58.110 --> 1:02:59.400
Look what we did.

1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:00.693
Look what you did?

1:03:01.672 --> 1:03:02.822
It's going to be great.

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:09.623
- Hey, can we get the
house side stemmed a bit?

1:03:10.810 --> 1:03:11.954
- Hey.

1:03:11.954 --> 1:03:14.160
- Hey, sorry about your mother.

1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:15.223
- Oh, thank you.

1:03:16.290 --> 1:03:17.930
- I didn't think y'all
were going to make it.

1:03:17.930 --> 1:03:21.565
- Well, of course opening
night with my best class ever.

1:03:21.565 --> 1:03:24.890
So I am so, so proud of you guys.

1:03:24.890 --> 1:03:26.500
Is there anything else you need from me?

1:03:26.500 --> 1:03:27.550
- I think we're good.

1:03:27.550 --> 1:03:28.994
- All right.

1:03:28.994 --> 1:03:30.514
Well then we're gonna grab our seats.

1:03:30.514 --> 1:03:31.554
- Enjoy.

1:03:31.554 --> 1:03:34.520
- Hey, break your legs every body.

1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:35.353
- Thank you.

1:03:37.726 --> 1:03:41.059
(classical music plays)

1:03:48.663 --> 1:03:50.670
- It's a packed house out there.

1:03:50.670 --> 1:03:52.300
Are you sure we know what we are doing?

1:03:52.300 --> 1:03:53.393
- Too late now.

1:03:54.490 --> 1:03:57.130
- Okay guys, the theater
has not seen a performance

1:03:57.130 --> 1:03:59.923
like this in over a
year, so let's show them

1:03:59.923 --> 1:04:01.527
what we can do.

1:04:01.527 --> 1:04:02.560
(students cheer)

1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:04.530
- At the end of act three is the finale.

1:04:04.530 --> 1:04:05.610
It is already planned.

1:04:05.610 --> 1:04:07.265
So just go with it.

1:04:07.265 --> 1:04:10.015
(people chatter)

1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:26.380
- Let's do this.

1:04:26.380 --> 1:04:27.340
- You all ready?

1:04:27.340 --> 1:04:28.850
Mother's Day on three, ready?

1:04:28.850 --> 1:04:33.850
- [Students] One, two three Mother's Day.

1:04:35.207 --> 1:04:37.457
(applause)

1:04:43.607 --> 1:04:45.400
- Good evening everyone.

1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:47.640
And welcome to the Towels theater.

1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:49.459
My name is Bri Ferguson
and this is Olivia Bell.

1:04:49.459 --> 1:04:52.900
And tonight we bring
you something special.

1:04:52.900 --> 1:04:54.755
It's an original play called...

1:04:54.755 --> 1:04:57.106
- [Bri and Olivia] "Mother's Day."

1:04:57.106 --> 1:04:59.430
(crowd applauds)

1:04:59.430 --> 1:05:02.650
- Now you may be wondering
why did we choose Mother's Day

1:05:02.650 --> 1:05:05.240
as a topic of this year's performance?

1:05:05.240 --> 1:05:07.370
Well, if you didn't
already know, Mother's Day

1:05:07.370 --> 1:05:10.450
is this weekend and this
theater, the Towel's theater

1:05:10.450 --> 1:05:13.503
plays a huge significance
in the creation of it.

1:05:13.503 --> 1:05:15.141
(screams)

1:05:15.141 --> 1:05:17.903
- Well, let's get to it.

1:05:17.903 --> 1:05:20.653
(crowd applauds)

1:05:25.261 --> 1:05:26.930
(piano plays)

1:05:26.930 --> 1:05:28.070
- Hurry, Mary, hurry.

1:05:28.070 --> 1:05:31.630
Oh, no you're going to be
late for your first day.

1:05:31.630 --> 1:05:33.200
- Mom, I'm so nervous.

1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:34.282
- You'll be fine.

1:05:34.282 --> 1:05:36.383
Just remember what I told you.

1:05:36.383 --> 1:05:40.933
Say what you'd like to
say and always smile.

1:05:43.381 --> 1:05:44.823
- I don't know what I do without you.

1:05:50.432 --> 1:05:53.182
(crowd applauds)

1:05:58.925 --> 1:05:59.758
- Good morning class.

1:05:59.758 --> 1:06:00.800
- [Students] Good morning.

1:06:00.800 --> 1:06:03.477
- My name is Ms. Towels, I'm your teacher.

1:06:03.477 --> 1:06:06.910
Now, my mom did always say to
greet everybody with a smile.

1:06:06.910 --> 1:06:09.823
So let's see them, beautiful.

1:06:10.660 --> 1:06:12.563
Well, I'm from Henderson, Kentucky.

1:06:12.563 --> 1:06:13.710
Like I said, my name is Ms. Towels.

1:06:13.710 --> 1:06:15.500
I'm an only child

1:06:15.500 --> 1:06:17.260
and now we have a go around the room

1:06:17.260 --> 1:06:19.010
and tell each other a
little bit about ourselves.

1:06:19.010 --> 1:06:21.520
But first we do have work to do.

1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:22.950
So let's get to it.

1:06:22.950 --> 1:06:23.910
- Sounds good.

1:06:23.910 --> 1:06:24.864
- All right.

1:06:24.864 --> 1:06:27.364
(piano plays)

1:06:31.630 --> 1:06:33.640
- Olivia, we've a problem.

1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:34.750
Molly left.

1:06:34.750 --> 1:06:36.250
- What do you mean she left?

1:06:36.250 --> 1:06:37.570
- She just walked out.

1:06:37.570 --> 1:06:38.880
- Go find her.

1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:39.830
- Where?

1:06:39.830 --> 1:06:41.393
- She has scenes.

1:06:41.393 --> 1:06:42.226
You go left.

1:06:42.226 --> 1:06:43.393
I'll go right.

1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:48.610
- Did you know that part?

1:06:48.610 --> 1:06:50.080
- Where is she?

1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:51.730
- You're bringing our mom's on stage.

1:06:51.730 --> 1:06:52.850
That's the Finale?

1:06:52.850 --> 1:06:53.837
- Why didn't you tell us?

1:06:53.837 --> 1:06:54.990
- It was a surprise.

1:06:54.990 --> 1:06:57.130
That how the first
Mother's Day was organized.

1:06:57.130 --> 1:06:58.870
Moms would make surprise visits to school

1:06:58.870 --> 1:07:01.130
and the students would introduce them.

1:07:01.130 --> 1:07:02.561
What's the big deal?

1:07:02.561 --> 1:07:03.394
I thought everyone would love it.

1:07:03.394 --> 1:07:04.370
- I mean, it's a good idea.

1:07:04.370 --> 1:07:06.370
- Molly doesn't have the best home line.

1:07:08.698 --> 1:07:10.350
Molly bolted.

1:07:10.350 --> 1:07:11.700
She heard about the Finale.

1:07:12.595 --> 1:07:14.373
- Well I have to get back out there.

1:07:14.373 --> 1:07:15.206
Can you find her?

1:07:15.206 --> 1:07:17.049
Listen, if she doesn't do this, you're on.

1:07:17.049 --> 1:07:17.882
- Okay.

1:07:19.853 --> 1:07:21.510
Come here, I'll help you with your lines.

1:07:21.510 --> 1:07:25.660
- So that's your first line.

1:07:25.660 --> 1:07:27.110
- Let's move on to poetry.

1:07:27.110 --> 1:07:29.760
How about we write it
inspired by our mothers?

1:07:29.760 --> 1:07:31.230
Any ideas?

1:07:31.230 --> 1:07:32.230
Yes.

1:07:32.230 --> 1:07:35.533
- Well, on Saturdays after
I finished my chores,

1:07:35.533 --> 1:07:38.120
my mom always makes time for us.

1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:39.420
She makes the best cakes.

1:07:39.420 --> 1:07:42.856
- My mother used to make the
most delicious chocolate cake.

1:07:42.856 --> 1:07:43.990
And what about you Sarah?

1:07:43.990 --> 1:07:46.010
- Well, my mother does
everything for my brother

1:07:46.010 --> 1:07:48.910
and I, I don't know what I do without her.

1:07:48.910 --> 1:07:51.000
- Mothers are very important.

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:51.833
And what about you?

1:07:51.833 --> 1:07:52.770
- Well, my mom.

1:07:53.699 --> 1:07:55.939
She always makes me the
best lunches for school.

1:07:55.939 --> 1:07:57.895
(laughs)

1:07:57.895 --> 1:07:59.380
- And you?

1:07:59.380 --> 1:08:00.899
- Molly.

1:08:00.899 --> 1:08:04.133
Molly.

1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:08.953
There you are.

1:08:15.699 --> 1:08:16.650
What's wrong?

1:08:16.650 --> 1:08:19.003
Hey, what's wrong?

1:08:21.450 --> 1:08:22.313
- I can't do it.

1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:25.620
We're all going to have to get up there

1:08:25.620 --> 1:08:28.020
and talk about our moms

1:08:28.020 --> 1:08:30.603
and I just can't.

1:08:32.780 --> 1:08:37.096
- Last week I had to go before a judge.

1:08:37.096 --> 1:08:42.096
See if I could keep the same parents.

1:08:43.660 --> 1:08:45.430
Think about that.

1:08:45.430 --> 1:08:47.370
I had to have some old dude tell me

1:08:47.370 --> 1:08:49.903
if I could keep the only
parents that I know.

1:08:52.220 --> 1:08:54.880
- Jacob, please don't think I'm ungrateful

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:57.837
or minimizing your situation.

1:08:57.837 --> 1:09:00.533
It's just, you don't know my mom.

1:09:02.096 --> 1:09:04.597
- You know what he said?

1:09:05.597 --> 1:09:10.597
He said, "Young man, no one
gets to pick their family.

1:09:10.890 --> 1:09:14.937
Your family is God's gift
designed specifically for you."

1:09:16.300 --> 1:09:17.393
God's gift, he said.

1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:23.800
So that means that God
created my crazy foster mom

1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:26.883
for me because she's crazy.

1:09:27.800 --> 1:09:29.660
She's not perfect.

1:09:29.660 --> 1:09:31.395
Just the other day.

1:09:31.395 --> 1:09:34.373
She lost the only set of car
keys we have, but she's mom.

1:09:36.747 --> 1:09:41.747
- So you think God designed
my mom specifically for me?

1:09:45.110 --> 1:09:49.413
- Yeah, she's not
perfect, but she's yours.

1:09:50.413 --> 1:09:53.330
(soft music plays)

1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:56.313
Now, come on.

1:09:57.570 --> 1:10:00.170
Olivia's in wardrobe,
she's going to do your part

1:10:00.170 --> 1:10:02.936
and don't be mad at her
for calling your mom.

1:10:02.936 --> 1:10:03.950
She didn't know.

1:10:03.950 --> 1:10:05.550
- She could do the finale too.

1:10:05.550 --> 1:10:08.020
- Well, she can't act to save her life

1:10:08.020 --> 1:10:09.470
and I'll be right beside you.

1:10:14.590 --> 1:10:15.850
- And how did the students react?

1:10:15.850 --> 1:10:17.660
- Oh darling, they loved it.

1:10:17.660 --> 1:10:20.632
Think about a day where
we all celebrate mothers.

1:10:20.632 --> 1:10:23.800
I just wish my mother was here to see it.

1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:26.136
- And what are you writing there?

1:10:26.136 --> 1:10:27.290
- A little something.

1:10:27.290 --> 1:10:28.123
- A new book

1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:29.873
- Maybe.

1:10:31.507 --> 1:10:32.850
- "Mother's Day"

1:10:32.850 --> 1:10:35.380
A celebration written by Mary Towles,

1:10:35.380 --> 1:10:38.117
Henderson, Kentucky 1893.

1:10:38.117 --> 1:10:41.220
"A mother's love is
unconditioned and is unmatched.

1:10:41.220 --> 1:10:44.210
Their influence to their
children is immeasurable.

1:10:44.210 --> 1:10:46.827
celebrating Mother's
Day, once a year, much

1:10:46.827 --> 1:10:50.450
to the veneration, love,
and respect due to parents

1:10:50.450 --> 1:10:52.760
might be song, verse, and story

1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:54.900
be inculcated in the next generation.

1:10:54.900 --> 1:10:57.132
Well said, well said, darling.

1:10:57.132 --> 1:10:59.882
(crowd applauds)

1:11:02.508 --> 1:11:03.341
- You got this?

1:11:03.341 --> 1:11:04.174
- No.

1:11:04.174 --> 1:11:05.007
- Yeah you do.

1:11:05.007 --> 1:11:05.911
- Yes, you can, just listen to me,

1:11:05.911 --> 1:11:08.551
remember what we rehearsed.

1:11:08.551 --> 1:11:10.030
Thank you.

1:11:10.030 --> 1:11:13.090
I am so sorry I didn't
tell you about the finale.

1:11:13.090 --> 1:11:14.252
- It's okay.

1:11:14.252 --> 1:11:15.900
Do you want to do this?

1:11:15.900 --> 1:11:17.123
- No, you have to.

1:11:17.990 --> 1:11:18.840
- You're awesome.

1:11:20.255 --> 1:11:22.338
(laughs)

1:11:29.350 --> 1:11:32.100
(crowd applauds)

1:11:46.150 --> 1:11:48.420
- I love West Virginia in the fall.

1:11:48.420 --> 1:11:49.573
- I do too, darling.

1:11:52.090 --> 1:11:53.440
Anna, what are you reading?

1:11:54.470 --> 1:11:55.303
- A school teacher

1:11:55.303 --> 1:11:58.450
from Kentucky is conducting
these mother celebrations

1:11:58.450 --> 1:12:00.370
in her classrooms.

1:12:00.370 --> 1:12:03.223
It looks like all over
Tennessee and Ohio too.

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:06.720
- Well, I like the sound of that.

1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:10.730
- She chooses April 20th of
every year for the celebration.

1:12:10.730 --> 1:12:12.740
Her mother's birthday.

1:12:12.740 --> 1:12:14.293
- Well, mine is in May.

1:12:15.140 --> 1:12:16.730
- She wrote a book about it.

1:12:16.730 --> 1:12:19.940
Listen to this mom, "Every man and woman,

1:12:19.940 --> 1:12:21.730
whom the world has called great,

1:12:21.730 --> 1:12:23.970
whose words have been
treasured for their goodness

1:12:23.970 --> 1:12:26.350
and wisdom, have cherished the memories

1:12:26.350 --> 1:12:27.303
of their mothers.

1:12:28.420 --> 1:12:31.010
These celebrations are
in fact an awakening

1:12:31.010 --> 1:12:32.810
on the part of the child.

1:12:32.810 --> 1:12:35.100
A deeper appreciation of her.

1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:37.337
Who's the central figure of the home."

1:12:38.321 --> 1:12:39.571
- Mother's Day.

1:12:40.501 --> 1:12:43.418
(soft music plays)

1:13:01.118 --> 1:13:03.701
(crowd cheers)

1:13:24.460 --> 1:13:27.440
- This Mother's Day proclamation is absurd

1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:29.550
and will not be passed by the Senate.

1:13:29.550 --> 1:13:32.750
- Senator, I have a very
important question for you.

1:13:32.750 --> 1:13:34.660
- Make it quick.

1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:36.442
- Do you have a mother?

1:13:36.442 --> 1:13:38.525
(laughs)

1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:47.680
- I, President Woodrow Wilson on this day

1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:52.550
May 9th, 1914 do declare

1:13:52.550 --> 1:13:56.837
that every second Sunday
in May, Mother's Day.

1:13:56.837 --> 1:13:59.420
(crowd cheers)

1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:06.360
- And that was how the story
of Mother's Day came to be

1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:08.820
from what school teacher
in Kentucky to another

1:14:08.820 --> 1:14:11.060
in West Virginia, all the
way to the White House.

1:14:11.060 --> 1:14:12.992
- And today it has become

1:14:12.992 --> 1:14:13.880
one of our most celebrated holidays

1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:15.810
in the world and around the nation.

1:14:15.810 --> 1:14:18.060
- To end this performance,
we have a surprise.

1:14:18.060 --> 1:14:19.750
You see the first Mother's Day

1:14:19.750 --> 1:14:22.860
or the Celebration of Mothers,
as they called it back then

1:14:22.860 --> 1:14:25.140
wasn't conducted with flowers, cards,

1:14:25.140 --> 1:14:26.680
or even lunch in a restaurant.

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:27.513
It was simple.

1:14:27.513 --> 1:14:29.660
- It was April 20th, 1887

1:14:29.660 --> 1:14:31.210
when a Henderson, Kentucky school teacher,

1:14:31.210 --> 1:14:34.190
Mary Towels Sassoon Wilson
surprised her students

1:14:34.190 --> 1:14:35.710
when she invited their moms

1:14:35.710 --> 1:14:37.870
into their classrooms for the holiday.

1:14:37.870 --> 1:14:40.410
- Here, the students
would introduce their moms

1:14:40.410 --> 1:14:41.350
to their schoolmates.

1:14:41.350 --> 1:14:43.980
They would write poems about
them and sing songs together.

1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:46.300
And that is exactly what
we have planned tonight.

1:14:46.300 --> 1:14:47.780
Please, if you are a parent

1:14:47.780 --> 1:14:50.163
of a student who is on
stage tonight, come up.

1:14:53.092 --> 1:14:55.842
(crowd applauds)

1:15:10.030 --> 1:15:13.460
- Well, my mom's my hero.

1:15:13.460 --> 1:15:16.610
See, our dad left us three
years ago and it was really hard

1:15:16.610 --> 1:15:19.550
and she's trying to make
a difference in my life.

1:15:19.550 --> 1:15:23.060
- See, she works double
shifts almost every day.

1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:28.060
And she's a warrior in motherhood
and just my best friend.

1:15:30.450 --> 1:15:33.200
(crowd applauds)

1:15:36.310 --> 1:15:40.430
- We have a busy household and my mom,

1:15:40.430 --> 1:15:43.350
she knows how to multitask, like no other.

1:15:43.350 --> 1:15:44.650
My dad has problems

1:15:44.650 --> 1:15:48.123
and my mom knows what to say,
to protect us and guard us.

1:15:48.969 --> 1:15:51.540
My mom is more than just a mom.

1:15:51.540 --> 1:15:54.748
She's the glue that binds
our family together.

1:15:54.748 --> 1:15:57.498
(crowd applauds)

1:16:02.910 --> 1:16:06.260
- My mom has been my role model since

1:16:06.260 --> 1:16:08.750
before I knew what that was.

1:16:08.750 --> 1:16:12.180
Her guidance, her perseverance,

1:16:12.180 --> 1:16:17.180
and her stubbornness are
unmatched, but she loves me.

1:16:18.670 --> 1:16:21.927
I feel if the night she
still thinks me to see

1:16:21.927 --> 1:16:24.593
I feel it in her desire to help me.

1:16:26.087 --> 1:16:28.087
Mom, I love you.

1:16:28.087 --> 1:16:29.964
- I love you.

1:16:29.964 --> 1:16:32.714
(crowd applauds)

1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:39.310
- This is Judy and she's my...

1:16:41.210 --> 1:16:42.073
She's my mom.

1:16:43.350 --> 1:16:46.260
She didn't give birth to me

1:16:46.260 --> 1:16:50.733
which makes it more special
because she picked me.

1:16:52.550 --> 1:16:53.503
She picked me.

1:16:54.487 --> 1:16:57.237
(crowd applauds)

1:17:02.180 --> 1:17:03.673
- Mom, I love you.

1:17:13.788 --> 1:17:16.538
(crowd applauds)

1:17:21.084 --> 1:17:24.501
- Mom, I don't say it enough, I love you.

1:17:26.444 --> 1:17:29.194
(crowd applauds)

1:17:33.290 --> 1:17:34.923
- That's my brother over there.

1:17:37.150 --> 1:17:38.030
My mom...

1:17:38.030 --> 1:17:40.783
Well, our parents died last year.

1:17:43.380 --> 1:17:44.323
I love you, mom.

1:17:45.330 --> 1:17:47.470
No one could ever take your place,

1:17:47.470 --> 1:17:49.603
but someone did.

1:17:50.910 --> 1:17:54.360
You see my mom's younger sister stepped in

1:17:56.028 --> 1:17:57.028
and she is an angel.

1:18:01.143 --> 1:18:03.893
(crowd applauds)

1:18:17.260 --> 1:18:19.563
- Wait, we have one more surprise.
