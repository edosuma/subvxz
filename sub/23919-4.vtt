00:40.707 --> 00:43.043
Are you getting paranoid?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.212
You're paranoid, huh?

00:45.212 --> 00:47.923
No. I just don't think
you're gonna like it up there.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.132
Where, Helen?

00:49.216 --> 00:50.217
I've been there before.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.677
Fourth grade. Field trip.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.136
Tamika Rich threw up.

00:53.220 --> 00:57.140
No, the festivities, <i>Fastnacht.</i>

00:57.224 --> 00:58.517
It's really traditional.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.602
Oh. Well,

01:00.686 --> 01:03.063
if we don't like it, we can just
go back to the lodge,

01:03.063 --> 01:04.398
and do lodge stuff.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.525
"Lodge stuff"?

01:06.525 --> 01:08.235
Yeah, lodge stuff.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.112
I know it sounds gross,

01:10.112 --> 01:12.072
but it's pretty much
what we were doing this morning.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.826
And you'll be high, so you'll
have more tongue confidence.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.745
You notice that?

01:22.332 --> 01:24.251
Now <i>I'm</i> paranoid.

01:26.170 --> 01:29.673
This is gonna sound like
a high question, but it's not.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.134
Got it.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.845
Are black women
considered brunettes?

01:56.533 --> 01:59.369
Is it weird
that made me hungry?

02:01.455 --> 02:03.457
You, too?

02:11.298 --> 02:15.010
Oh, shit.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.683
This is nice.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.977
We're gonna be the only
black people here, aren't we?

02:24.061 --> 02:25.229
Christina's half.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.233
The important thing
is the <i>Faschingstanz,</i>

02:29.233 --> 02:31.360
and make sure you mix in
some actual dance moves

02:31.360 --> 02:34.321
with the traditional ones.
They'll love that.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.782
- All right.
- We're gonna win for sure.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.325
Christina's gonna be so mad,

02:38.325 --> 02:39.952
'cause Dave can't dance
for shit.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.204
I'm not that great, either.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.206
I don't know.
You got some swag.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.167
It's weird swag,
but people like it.

02:47.251 --> 02:51.630
Oh, by the way, traditionally,
there's a moor character

02:51.630 --> 02:53.799
that people show up
in blackface, so...

02:53.799 --> 02:55.217
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.135
When you were a kid,
didn't you feel, like,

02:57.219 --> 02:59.054
weird about all that?

02:59.054 --> 03:00.973
Hmm, I used to.

03:00.973 --> 03:04.142
But I'm kind of like the Serena
Williams of the festivities.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.854
They hate, but they can't
deny the stats.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.230
You're so competitive.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.358
I know. And you love it.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.536
Hey, baby.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.079
Hey!

03:24.079 --> 03:25.998
- Oh, my God. Hi.
- It is so good to see you.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.291
- What's up, Van? How are you?
- Hey, Dave.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.168
I'm good. Ha, look.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.377
- Hey, yo!
- Amazing.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.670
- That looks good.
- Love it.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.422
Look at you.
Look, I told you she'd dress up.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.548
Earn.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.008
Earn!

03:36.008 --> 03:37.384
You want to take our picture?

03:37.384 --> 03:38.886
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, um...
- Huh.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.430
There we go.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.015
- I took three.
- Thank you.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.391
Where is your costume?

03:44.391 --> 03:45.642
Oh, yeah. That's not me.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.019
I'm not really into...

03:47.019 --> 03:48.270
Y-Yeah, but you
got to dress up, man.

03:48.270 --> 03:51.106
I mean, like, why are you here?

03:51.190 --> 03:53.442
- Look at me. I'm wearing lederhosen, dawg.
- Yeah.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.818
I-I get it. I don't know.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.904
Van likes it.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.697
- Where-where'd she go, though?
- Yo.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.115
- I got a spare mask in the whip.
- I'm...

04:00.199 --> 04:01.408
- I'm all right, man.
- You sure?

04:01.408 --> 04:02.701
- I'm sure, man.
- You'd look good in it.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.620
I feel good like this.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.375
What the hell is that?

04:10.459 --> 04:12.294
It's a <i>Schnappviecher.</i>
It's a demon thief.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.087
Every <i>Fastnacht,</i>
he steals something

04:14.171 --> 04:15.923
from one unlucky villager.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.257
No way!

04:17.341 --> 04:19.468
You look so good!

04:23.555 --> 04:26.016
Oh.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.435
You look great.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.354
And I'm sorry.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.694
Where's that mask
you were talking about?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.029
Yeah, it's in the whip.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.364
Cool.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.283
Welcome to another <i>Fastnacht.</i>

04:43.367 --> 04:44.409
Here, take these, please.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.619
- Game on.
- Thank you.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.454
We've got some
excellent prizes tonight,

04:47.538 --> 04:49.248
provided by Dixie Gas.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.959
Big shout-out to Dixie Gas
for these two movie gift cards.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.757
And I don't know
about the rest of you,

04:58.841 --> 05:00.467
but I'm ready to Hootz-Kutz.

05:06.682 --> 05:09.351
Just bounce
the ball to me when it comes,

05:09.351 --> 05:12.437
but don't say "Hootz-Kutz"
unless you have to. Okay.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.483
- He's never played.
- Okay, okay.

05:16.567 --> 05:17.901
Are we ready to Hootz-Kutz?

05:17.985 --> 05:18.986
Yeah!

05:18.986 --> 05:21.905
On-on my count. Ready,

05:21.989 --> 05:23.657
set, go.

05:27.578 --> 05:28.704
Oh!
Come on, Earn.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.497
You're supposed to
catch it, okay?

05:30.581 --> 05:32.374
- I'm sorry. All right, sorry.
- It's okay.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.751
Go.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.670
There it is!

05:39.840 --> 05:41.466
We're supposed to pass them.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.302
Don't just...
Oh, my God!

05:43.302 --> 05:45.888
Switch!

05:45.888 --> 05:47.973
Hold, hold.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.815
Thank you.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.610
Earn, you're just
standing there, dude.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.403
Earn.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.946
Earn, don't just stand there. Earn.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.200
What'd you-- whoa, whoa. Whoa.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.409
Whoa. That was crazy.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.369
How'd you do that?

06:09.453 --> 06:11.371
I just put the...

06:11.455 --> 06:13.498
I just held the balls
and put them in the jug.

06:13.582 --> 06:14.583
Shh, no, no. No, hold on.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.127
I've been playing Hootz-Kutz

06:17.211 --> 06:18.420
since I was a little kid,
and I've...

06:18.504 --> 06:20.547
I've never seen anyone do that.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.550
Shit, dude.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.472
No, seriously, man.
How-how did you do that?

06:30.265 --> 06:33.477
I just held the balls
and-and put them in the jug.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.649
Oh, my goodness.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.990
Earnest <i>"Halten"</i> Marks!

06:47.074 --> 06:48.951
Give it up for Earn!

06:55.040 --> 06:56.959
ALL
Earn! Earn!

06:56.959 --> 06:59.419
Earn! Earn! Earn!
Earn! Earn!

07:05.884 --> 07:07.427
What's <i>"halten"?</i>

07:07.511 --> 07:09.263
It just means "to hold."

07:09.263 --> 07:11.181
You really should learn German.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.976
Yeah, I know.
It's so useful.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.478
You got lucky as fuck
back there.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.564
You should listen to me
next time.

07:18.564 --> 07:21.191
You're starting to sound more
like Serena Williams's dad.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.401
Hello.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.236
What can I get you?

07:24.236 --> 07:25.445
- Wow.
- Uh...

07:31.660 --> 07:33.453
No.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.622
Okay.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.334
Did you understand that?

07:39.418 --> 07:41.211
No.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.337
Okay.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.677
The mask, maybe...?

07:48.677 --> 07:50.262
Mm... yeah.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.651
Ding, ding.
How about some service?

08:06.737 --> 08:07.738
Wow.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.541
Here you go.

08:50.614 --> 08:51.865
There's always gonna be
more girls, man.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.242
I get that, but...

08:56.036 --> 08:57.287
But how are you supposed to
know what you want

08:57.371 --> 08:58.413
the rest of your life
right now?

08:58.497 --> 09:00.082
Sometimes I feel like
she wants me to be lame.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.751
I mean, like, this isn't me.
I mean, like...

09:02.835 --> 09:05.170
You know, I don't know,
maybe she wants

09:05.254 --> 09:06.797
a guy who could speak German.
You know what I'm say--

09:06.797 --> 09:10.300
a guy who enjoys dancing
to polka music.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.344
I'm not that dude.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.596
I-I don't know why she wants me
to pretend like I'm that dude.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.809
Well, she just, you know, wants
to spend more time with you,

09:18.809 --> 09:20.811
and that's what girls do
when they like you.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.396
They just want to twist
their life up with yours.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.522
That way, it's harder
to disconnect.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.148
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.943
Um, so, the guys are dancing
in three minutes.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.653
You want to go over some moves?

09:29.653 --> 09:32.322
Yeah, actually,
let's go over here for a sec.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.616
Okay.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.750
Ping-Pong.

09:43.834 --> 09:47.171
No. This is obviously a
traditional Pingen-Pong...

09:47.171 --> 09:49.631
tablisch... <i>- Tischtennisplatte.</i>

09:49.715 --> 09:51.842
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- Mm-hmm.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.552
Yeah, I was just thinking

09:53.552 --> 09:55.387
we could spend some
one-on-one time together.

09:55.387 --> 09:58.640
Can we spend some
one-on-one time dancing?

09:58.724 --> 10:01.435
It's just one game.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.771
Come on. It's the only
white game I know.

10:07.024 --> 10:10.944
Okay. But one game.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.821
If I win,

10:12.905 --> 10:15.199
no more complaining.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.658
We dance

10:16.742 --> 10:20.662
and my name is on the front
of the trophy.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.414
- Fair.
- Okay.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.374
- And if I win...
- Mm...

10:24.458 --> 10:26.210
- Come on.
- Oh.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.003
- Mm, mm. Mm-hmm.
- Okay, well,

10:28.003 --> 10:29.963
don't be upset when you're
in a weird sexual position.

10:30.047 --> 10:31.798
You need a warm-up?
Come on.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.634
Let's go. Best out of three.

10:33.634 --> 10:34.760
Ready?

10:34.760 --> 10:36.845
- Okay.
- Ready?

10:39.848 --> 10:42.100
Baby, I thought
you used to play.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.727
Yeah, okay.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.729
Come on.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.314
Come on, Serena.
Let's do it. You got it.

10:59.743 --> 11:00.994
Fuck.

11:01.078 --> 11:04.206
That's two out of three, baby.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.333
Mm-hmm. Come on.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.794
Let's go dancing.
It's match point.

11:08.794 --> 11:11.713
Why'd you do that?

11:11.797 --> 11:14.007
What're you talking about?
This was your idea.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.676
Yeah, but when
we play basketball,

11:15.676 --> 11:17.803
I don't just destroy you
in front of everybody.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.516
There's nobody here.
They're all dancing.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.728
Oh, my God.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.525
I'm sorry.
Was he here the whole time?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.902
He was standing
right next to me?

11:35.904 --> 11:37.823
Let's go. Come on.
You lost. Let's go.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.533
I'm-I'm not in the mood.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.453
Seriously?

11:44.955 --> 11:47.749
You're being a fucking baby.

11:47.833 --> 11:51.378
Fine. I'll do it
if I fucking have to.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.713
This is typical.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.091
- Whatever.
- Wait. Hold up. I'm sorry. What?

11:56.175 --> 11:58.177
I said I'll do it
if we fucking have to.

11:58.177 --> 12:01.597
You don't have to do shit.

12:01.597 --> 12:03.390
We do your shit
all the fucking time.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.100
We went to a strip club.

12:05.184 --> 12:06.852
- You like the strip club.
- I like going to a strip club?

12:06.852 --> 12:10.063
I'm a woman. I need to go
fucking look at titties?

12:10.147 --> 12:11.940
- Then just say you don't enjoy it.
- No.

12:12.024 --> 12:13.901
- You didn't like that.
- I want to just spend time with you.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.152
- It doesn't matter to me.
- Well, I was trying

12:15.152 --> 12:16.987
- to fucking spend time with you.
- I wanted to go dancing.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.947
It's fucking stupid.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.949
I don't like it.

12:21.033 --> 12:24.161
But you can't do it for me?

12:24.161 --> 12:26.580
I'm not trying to go
to fucking Alfred's concerts

12:26.580 --> 12:27.915
every fucking weekend.

12:27.915 --> 12:28.999
I wouldn't shit on that.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.834
That's paying
your fucking bills.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.838
Wow.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.465
Yeah.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.932
You can be real mean, man.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.319
Fuck you.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.870
<i>♪ One: don't pick up the phone,
you know he's only calling</i> ♪

13:06.954 --> 13:07.955
<i>'Cause he's drunk and alone ♪</i>

13:07.955 --> 13:10.791
Where'd Earn go?

13:10.791 --> 13:14.878
Ugh. He's being a baby.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.548
I don't understand what...

13:17.548 --> 13:19.049
he wants from me.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.884
- Christina. Oh, my God.
- Oh! Hi.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.970
- How are you, Flo?
- It's so good to see you. So good!

13:22.970 --> 13:24.888
- I'm so glad you're here.
- What's going on?

13:24.972 --> 13:26.223
Oh, just everything.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.058
- Yeah?
- I know. It's so good to see you.

13:28.058 --> 13:31.436
- It's so good to see you, too.
- Did you see Jen here?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.021
I vaguely remember.
I think I saw her.

13:33.105 --> 13:34.273
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! Oh.

13:34.273 --> 13:36.650
This is Flo.
Flo, this is Lottie's mom.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.360
Oh, my God.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.987
So nice to finally meet you.

13:39.987 --> 13:43.031
- Mm-hmm.
- Kai is in love with Lottie.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.158
She's just so polite and sweet
when she's at our house.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.035
Oh. She better be.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.037
Uh, hi. I'm Tek.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.914
- It's nice to meet you.
- You, too.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.458
Babe, this is Lottie's mom.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.044
- Right. Okay, Earn's girl.
- Yes.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.838
Yes.
- Right. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.923
You know, Earn's making
some really cool moves

14:00.007 --> 14:02.092
with Paper Boi.
People are really impressed.

14:02.176 --> 14:03.302
Thank you. So...

14:03.302 --> 14:04.887
Tek hears all the tea
at the label.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.013
Yeah, a lot of tea.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.056
I handle his publishing.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.975
So, do you work with Earn,

14:09.975 --> 14:12.102
or you an artist?

14:12.186 --> 14:15.689
No, I'm sort of
in between things right now.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.733
I stay at home mostly.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.401
Oh, she used to be a teacher.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.695
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.197
You're so lucky.

14:23.197 --> 14:26.074
Thank you. Yeah.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.287
Babe. What's going on?

14:30.287 --> 14:31.663
- Wait. W-W-Wait.
- I just need a drink.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.040
No. No, no, no, no, no.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.124
Let-Let's sit down.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.834
Let's sit--
no, no, no, seriously.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.961
Come. Sit down.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.756
It's gonna be fine.

14:41.757 --> 14:43.926
What's going on?

14:43.926 --> 14:45.969
I don't know why
you have to introduce me

14:46.053 --> 14:48.096
as Lottie's mom.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.349
- You know my first name.
- Yeah, but...

14:50.349 --> 14:51.975
And that's not all
that I'm gonna be

14:52.059 --> 14:53.894
for the rest of my life,
is Lottie's mom.

14:53.894 --> 14:57.105
Of course not. I know that.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.942
But you make that shit
look good.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.944
Like, it's different for you.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.780
What do you... what do you mean?

15:04.780 --> 15:06.114
You know,
it just seems like something

15:06.198 --> 15:08.992
that you're more ready for.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.247
- What do you mean?
- Because...

15:13.247 --> 15:16.458
you know, like, you chose Earn.

15:16.542 --> 15:19.962
I chose Dave.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.258
Mm-hmm.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.134
Yeah, like, since we were kids.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.345
Like, I chose white.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.972
You chose black. Like, it's...

15:29.972 --> 15:33.141
Okay.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.352
- No.
- You... Yeah.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.437
I didn't choose black.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.942
Yes, you did.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.152
You never hung out
with me and Melanie

15:44.236 --> 15:45.737
when we invited you.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.322
And you only went
to the black parties.

15:47.406 --> 15:48.949
I mean...

15:48.949 --> 15:51.034
it's like you needed
that identity.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.286
Yeah, but you...

15:52.286 --> 15:55.038
But Melanie
was never nice to me.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.124
Well, I mean,

15:57.124 --> 15:58.959
you never invited me
to your parties.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.587
That's because, um,

16:01.587 --> 16:04.715
you always acted
like you were better than us,

16:04.715 --> 16:08.510
and you would pander to us

16:08.594 --> 16:11.013
and say shit like,
"I wish I had kinky hair."

16:11.013 --> 16:13.640
Which you do.
You just... you straighten it.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.142
So it's, like, weird to...

16:15.142 --> 16:16.351
it's weird to say.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.353
- Do you know what I mean?
- I didn't, and I think

16:18.437 --> 16:19.605
- you're going way too far.
- What?

16:19.605 --> 16:20.981
- Like, seriously?
- You literally just told me

16:20.981 --> 16:23.150
that I'm gonna be a baby mama,

16:23.150 --> 16:25.152
and that's okay
because I "chose black."

16:25.152 --> 16:26.820
- Well, of course...
- - Are you serious?
- Babe!

16:26.904 --> 16:28.614
We won, babe!

16:28.614 --> 16:30.991
- Will you take a pic? My phone's died.
- Yeah.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.409
Yay.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.746
Shit. I don't know
where my phone is.

16:35.746 --> 16:37.164
I thought I had it.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.624
I just had it.
For real? Really?

16:38.624 --> 16:40.626
- Yeah.
- Did someone get Schnapped?

16:42.920 --> 16:45.339
It is now the witching hour.

16:45.339 --> 16:46.840
Who here has been struck

16:46.924 --> 16:48.008
- by the <i>Schnappviecher?</i>
- Right here!

16:48.008 --> 16:49.801
Right here!

16:49.885 --> 16:51.803
<i>Wudeljagd!</i>

16:53.889 --> 16:55.057
<i>Wudeljagd!</i>

16:57.476 --> 17:00.854
<i>Wudeljagd, Wudeljagd!</i>

17:02.481 --> 17:05.484
<i>Wudeljagd,
Wudeljagd, Wudeljagd!</i>

18:21.518 --> 18:22.811
Okay.

18:58.889 --> 19:00.807
Hello?

19:10.859 --> 19:12.152
Hi.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.125
You find it?

20:09.710 --> 20:11.628
Uh-huh.

20:11.712 --> 20:14.381
Vanessa Keifer
is this year's warrior!

20:33.984 --> 20:35.694
You want a rematch?

20:38.447 --> 20:41.450
What do you want?

20:42.492 --> 20:45.287
A rematch.

20:45.287 --> 20:48.874
I mean in our relationship.

20:51.335 --> 20:53.212
This feels like a trap.

20:53.212 --> 20:56.089
It's not a trap.

20:56.173 --> 20:59.426
No bullshit. What do you want?

21:06.141 --> 21:08.310
You want me to go first?

21:08.310 --> 21:10.229
Please.

21:10.229 --> 21:12.481
I want to be...

21:12.481 --> 21:14.942
in a committed relationship

21:14.942 --> 21:17.277
where I'm valued
as a human being

21:17.361 --> 21:21.365
and not as an accessory
that you can fuck.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.956
That's a good answer.

21:30.541 --> 21:32.793
Um...

21:34.545 --> 21:37.464
I don't know what I want. I...

21:37.548 --> 21:41.426
I know this...
arrangement works for me.

21:45.556 --> 21:48.433
So it works for you.

21:50.018 --> 21:53.397
So, you don't want
to change anything?

21:54.857 --> 21:57.651
This definitely feels
like a trap.

21:59.570 --> 22:02.614
I don't want to keep having
this conversation.

22:03.657 --> 22:05.576
I'm really tired.

22:05.576 --> 22:08.078
Well, we don't have to have
this conversation now.

22:08.078 --> 22:09.496
We can talk about it
in the morning.

22:09.580 --> 22:12.082
Well, I don't want to keep
waiting around for you.

22:14.877 --> 22:17.963
And I don't want you
to waste any more of your time.

22:23.093 --> 22:25.304
Then let's settle it.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.476
If I win,

22:31.560 --> 22:34.479
you only have to see me
if it's about Lottie or money.

22:34.563 --> 22:36.481
That's not what I meant.

22:36.565 --> 22:38.859
Then beat me.

22:41.445 --> 22:43.739
I don't see
what this is gonna prove.

22:43.739 --> 22:47.075
It's gonna prove that I'm tired.

22:56.043 --> 22:57.252
All right.

22:57.336 --> 22:58.712
Best of five.
