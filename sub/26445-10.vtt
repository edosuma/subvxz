WEBVTT

00:06.548 --> 00:08.550
[Tyler crying]

00:10.677 --> 00:11.970
Jesus! Tyler!

00:12.345 --> 00:13.471
What the hell, man?

00:13.555 --> 00:17.600
I've been fired for working
with the Shame Wizard!

00:17.684 --> 00:20.353
Well, yeah. That makes perfect sense,
you screwed up.

00:20.437 --> 00:24.691
I know, but I really wanted to be there
when you squinched your first load.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.860
So hold on, wait, wait, wait.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.654
If you're fired, who's gonna be
my new Hormone Monster?

00:29.738 --> 00:31.448
Well, I'm not in charge of that.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.034
Your puberty's just on hold
until they figure it out.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.369
-On hold?
-I shouldn't even be here.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.620
Stupid Tyler!

00:37.704 --> 00:39.956
-They're gonna be so mad at me.
-Who's gonna be mad?

00:40.040 --> 00:42.834
Give your mom's big naturals
one last honk for me.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.461
Smell her!

00:45.378 --> 00:46.588
What the...?

00:48.423 --> 00:49.758
Whoa.

00:54.679 --> 00:55.513
Okay.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.756
Good morning, students.

01:29.839 --> 01:35.011
I have 87 days until I retire and move in
with my sister in Clearwater, Florida.

01:35.095 --> 01:35.929
[thud]

01:36.012 --> 01:37.847
And we thank you, Principal Baron.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.765
Okay,

01:38.848 --> 01:42.644
a lot of debauchery went down here
during the lunar eclipse.

01:42.727 --> 01:45.396
I mean, there was a goddamn fire in here.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.233
And one of you mongrels
shat right through the basketball hoop.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.568
-[kids laughing]
-Don't laugh.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.695
This slam dunk dookie kid is sick!

01:52.779 --> 01:54.864
By that he means
the kid is medically unwell.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.784
Yes, we are worried
'cause the turd kept its heat.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.619
-Three days, it kept warm.
-[kids laughing]

01:59.702 --> 02:00.870
Come on, goddammit.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.498
I'm still seeing a lot
of smiling faces out there.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.125
You think this is fucking funny?

02:05.208 --> 02:08.211
Look, if any of you have information
about who started the fire,

02:08.294 --> 02:10.338
please, rat out your fellow students.

02:10.421 --> 02:14.175
Spill your guts like that sick dookie kid
did out on the basketball court.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.510
[bell rings]

02:16.302 --> 02:19.347
Oh, Andrew, there you are. You gotta
come over to my house after school.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.932
I have something crazy to show you.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.768
Oh, my God, you found Diane Lane's
beach house on Google Maps?

02:23.852 --> 02:25.270
-What? Who?
-Diane Lane.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.273
Nick, do yourself a favor
and see Unfaithful.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.357
Yes, it's sexy,

02:29.440 --> 02:32.152
but it's got a real story
and it is beautifully shot.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.863
-Well, her lover has this loft--
-Andrew, just come over.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.948
I'd love to,
but I don't wanna see your sister.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.200
It'll be so weird because of the whole...

02:39.701 --> 02:41.327
Yeah, it'll be fine.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.830
That Shame Wizard guy is gone,
remember?

02:43.913 --> 02:45.957
Yeah, come on, I miss Nick's house.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.126
They have DirecTV
and name brand cookies.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.836
-Yeah.
-And your dad's not there.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.714
No, I know. My house is a nightmare.
Okay, Nick, let's do it.

02:52.797 --> 02:53.715
No more shame.

02:53.798 --> 02:57.385
And why does your dad keep a bucket
of power tools in the bathroom?

02:57.468 --> 02:59.512
So, how about that lunar eclipse?

02:59.596 --> 03:00.680
Yeah, pretty crazy.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.682
Something really awoke inside of me.

03:02.765 --> 03:03.933
Eyebrows, eyebrows.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.727
Um, listen, I got to go.
[sighs]

03:05.810 --> 03:07.353
My mom's making me do this thing.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.855
Well, I got a thing, too.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.024
It's a book about female sensuality

03:11.107 --> 03:13.818
called Ripples From the Inside Out.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.570
Oh, good for you.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.280
Yeah, it is good for me.

03:17.363 --> 03:20.283
And so, it turns out,
is the faucet of my bathtub.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.368
[sighs] Eyebrows, eyebrows.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.245
Hey, Matthew.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.206
-Hello, Jay.
-[chuckles softly]

03:26.289 --> 03:29.083
Epic game of Smooch or Share, huh?
[chuckles softly]

03:29.167 --> 03:30.001
Uh-huh.

03:30.084 --> 03:33.254
Especially when we continued the game
later on when we were in private,

03:33.338 --> 03:35.381
but it was still part of the game
and not real life.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.926
Okay, I see you're dealing with us
making out really well.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.093
Is that what we did?

03:39.177 --> 03:42.555
Okay, I barely remember
or think about it at all all the time.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.557
Relax. It was a one-time thing.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.975
[sighs deeply] Great.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.810
See you at the Manhole in ten years.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.897
Yeah, right!
I'll see you at the Manhole in ten years!

03:50.980 --> 03:51.898
Oh, God.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.900
What? Oh. Wha...? Argh!

03:53.983 --> 03:55.235
Hey, Coach Steve,

03:55.318 --> 03:57.153
we got a few questions for you.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.821
You got questions? For me?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.824
I feel terrible,
I didn't get you anything.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.451
Any idea who started the fire?

04:03.534 --> 04:07.163
'Cause we're looking for this so-called
"Arson Person."

04:07.247 --> 04:09.249
That's nothing.
That's a nothing nickname.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.210
Okay, then,
how about The Pyro Maniac?

04:12.293 --> 04:13.544
That's already a goddamn word!

04:13.628 --> 04:17.090
You know what's not a word:
"cunther." So...

04:17.632 --> 04:20.843
So this therapist
is supposed to be very cool.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.053
Just give her a chance.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.846
-I don't wanna give her a chance.
-Yeah!

04:23.930 --> 04:26.099
You're not the boss of us, Shannon.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.935
Just 'cause you're taller
and you got a big-ass purse.

04:29.018 --> 04:31.104
I'm not gonna talk about my private life

04:31.187 --> 04:33.564
with some random person
I've never met before.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.901
Well, maybe you should've thought
of that before you decided to run away

04:36.985 --> 04:39.070
and shoplift and do drugs.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.614
-She made a list?
-I could keep going.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.284
This cunther made a goddamn list!

04:44.534 --> 04:46.911
Well, if anyone needs a therapist,
it's you, Mom.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.122
Sweetheart, you don't have a choice.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.665
You're going. End of story.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.625
No. No, no, no.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.420
Hit her! Hit her while she's driving!

04:55.503 --> 04:58.881
Will you please stop it
with the terrible ideas?

04:58.965 --> 05:01.134
Oh, God, I'm so tired of both of you!

05:01.217 --> 05:03.094
Jessi, what the hell are you doing?

05:03.177 --> 05:05.596
Yeah, what you doing, Lady Bird?

05:05.680 --> 05:08.850
Don't leave me alone
with Shitshow Shannon!

05:10.643 --> 05:13.146
-Well, if it isn't Andrew Glouberman.
-Hi, sweetie.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.981
Oh, we have missed you.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.107
Oh, yeah.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.026
Yeah, well, I got a job.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.903
I'm working nights at... the museum.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.448
-Oh, the museum. That sounds real.
-[screams]

05:23.531 --> 05:26.117
-I mean, hi, Leah.
-Nice to see you again, Andrew.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.161
And to be seen by you,

05:28.244 --> 05:30.747
a pleasure and a blessing.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.624
It's always cool between us.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.085
Okay, well, hang loose, dude.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.420
Very smooth.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.756
Okay, we'll be upstairs.
See y'all at dinner.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.674
Have fun fucking, shitheads.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.635
[chuckles] From the twisted mind
of Judd Birch. I love it.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.221
[Brad sniffs] Damn!

05:47.305 --> 05:49.849
Look at that fine Mediterranean ass.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.100
[stammering] Who are you?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.186
I'm Brad. You're Jay, right?

05:53.269 --> 05:54.771
You look nice, bro.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.857
So fit. Mr. Perfect. You exercise?

05:57.940 --> 06:00.568
I mean, I jump on the trampoline
in my backyard.

06:00.651 --> 06:03.529
Hell yeah, you do. I bet
you have the best body in your grade.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.156
I don't know exact--

06:05.239 --> 06:07.367
Wait, what do you want, Brad?

06:07.450 --> 06:09.035
What do you think I want, bro?

06:09.118 --> 06:11.329
I'm thirsty for that olive pecker.

06:11.412 --> 06:15.416
Listen, as much as I'd love to dump
a full load of tzatziki in you,

06:15.500 --> 06:18.503
I don't know that I should.
I have a girlfriend, Suzette.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.796
Oh, I know that pillow.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.881
So does every cake-boy at GNC.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.800
Besides, I can keep a secret, bro.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.677
My lips stay shut
when I'm not sucking you off.

06:26.761 --> 06:27.678
Oh, wow.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.555
[laughs] I mean, right, okay.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.933
Very cool. Okay.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.811
Are you insane?
I'm not going in there.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.688
Come on, Andrew.
They put my puberty on hold.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.607
I know, that does sound bad.

06:39.690 --> 06:43.528
I need a new Hormone Monster,
and this time I want someone good.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.947
Yeah, but you don't even know
where this portal leads.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.407
It's safe, okay?

06:47.490 --> 06:49.867
I tied a rope to a tennis ball,
threw it in there,

06:49.951 --> 06:51.911
and when I pulled it back,
it was totally fine.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.789
This tennis ball is covered in pubes.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.374
-Yeah, I guess that's weird.
-It is.

06:56.457 --> 06:59.419
-Like, whose pubes are they, right?
-Just shut up and do it already, pussies.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.795
-Jessi?
-What are you doing here?

07:00.878 --> 07:03.131
I came over to get away
from my stupid mom,

07:03.214 --> 07:06.134
but then I overheard you dweebs
talking about your portal,

07:06.217 --> 07:07.427
and I want in.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.511
You want in?

07:08.594 --> 07:10.346
Did you not see the ball of pubes?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.515
Who even cares? Life sucks ass.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.308
-Interesting take.
-Fuck it.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.226
-No!
-Argh!

07:15.309 --> 07:17.311
-Oh, my God, I can't believe--
-Come on, Andrew.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.980
Don't be a pussy!

07:19.063 --> 07:20.064
No, Nick, don't...

07:20.148 --> 07:23.025
Have you both lost your minds?
I'm not going in.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.111
I'm not gonna do it. I'm not--
[screams]

07:25.361 --> 07:27.363
[screaming, grunts]

07:27.822 --> 07:30.116
Well, my chapstick broke in my pocket,

07:30.199 --> 07:32.368
so these jeans,
yeah, they're ruined.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.327
Whoa.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.873
[Jessi] What is this place?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.834
"Welcome to Human Resources.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.377
We manage people."

07:41.461 --> 07:42.962
"Presented by Acura"?

07:43.045 --> 07:44.547
-What does that even mean?
-Look!

07:44.630 --> 07:46.132
"The Department of Puberty."

07:46.215 --> 07:49.177
I bet that place is chock-full
of Hormone Monsters.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.094
-Let's go.
-Wait.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.596
Are we even supposed to be here?

07:51.679 --> 07:53.014
Just try to blend in.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.015
Be casual.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.558
Yes, be casual.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.977
Okay. Hang cool, everyone.

07:58.060 --> 07:58.978
Cowabunga.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.771
Be Andrew.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.065
[indistinct chattering]

08:07.028 --> 08:08.321
[Andrew] Oh, my God.

08:08.404 --> 08:11.240
Hey, check it out:
Hormone Division, floor 13.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.158
Come on.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.951
-How you doing, Bob?
-There you are.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.703
-My mother-in-law's in town.
-Oof.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.788
Yeah. She said something
so insulting.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.207
-What'd she say?
-She goes,

08:19.290 --> 08:22.585
"You couldn't get a kid a boner
if you jerked him off yourself."

08:22.668 --> 08:23.544
Jesus.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.254
Listen, she's right, but you know--

08:25.338 --> 08:27.256
-She say it in front of your kids?
-No, in front of me!

08:27.340 --> 08:28.508
-That's awful.
-[elevator dings]

08:28.591 --> 08:30.092
-There's my floor.
-Okay, see you later.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.761
HORMONE
DIVISION

08:32.428 --> 08:35.139
Holy shit. It's Maury at work.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.933
Aww. He has a whole life.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.602
Yeah, just got my pilot's license.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.562
You gotta come up with me
sometime, Lorraine.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.773
All you need to do is bring your bikini.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.733
-And money to pay for your trip.
-[giggles]

08:46.442 --> 08:47.902
What the...?

08:48.152 --> 08:50.154
Wow, Maury! Was that you flirting?

08:50.238 --> 08:51.864
-Blow it out your ass, Gavin.
-[chuckles]

08:51.948 --> 08:53.032
Lorraine already did.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.034
-[giggling]
-She laughs at everything.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.245
-You wanna chew on a door jamb.
-[giggling]

08:57.328 --> 08:59.163
All right, well,
I gotta get back to work.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.414
My dick don't quit.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.751
I just got two 13-year-olds laid,
on a school night no less.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.128
I want him. That's my guy.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.006
He does seem confident.
New Jersey confident.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.800
I'm gonna find his office
and talk to him.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.301
Wait here with--
Where did Jessi go?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.970
Hey, what the hell are you two
doing here?

09:14.053 --> 09:15.763
Maury! Look, Nick made us come--

09:15.846 --> 09:17.890
I'm taking you home right now.
Let's go, butt-fucks.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.184
But we lost Jessi, she came here with us.
We can't go.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.563
Shit, you kids are like dogs.
I need to put you on a leash.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.065
-[giggling]
-I am enamored with you, Lorraine.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.275
[giggling]

09:27.567 --> 09:28.776
-[door opens]
-Tyler.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.362
Of course that little shit left
a portal open.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.115
That's exactly why I need
a new Hormone Monster.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.242
Maybe you could introduce me
to that guy Gavin?

09:36.325 --> 09:38.244
You want to work with that chode?

09:38.327 --> 09:40.830
It doesn't matter. You don't have
the time to talk to him anyway.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.540
-Why not?
-Humans can't stay in this world

09:42.623 --> 09:43.749
for longer than an hour.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.084
If you do, it'll be--

09:45.167 --> 09:48.588
Oh, fuck! Our dicks will age rapidly
and fall off

09:48.671 --> 09:50.214
like a bunch of rotten nectarines?

09:50.298 --> 09:53.050
-Where do you come up with this shit?
-[softly] I don't know.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.594
Look, the point is, if you stay here,

09:54.677 --> 09:56.887
you will be developmentally
stunted forever.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.432
Either physically,
like child weightlifters,

09:59.515 --> 10:02.476
or mentally, like my dear friend's son,
Michael Jackson.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.728
But I want to grow up.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.063
I have big plans to be a regular man.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.024
I'm going to go find Jessi.
Stay here.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.692
Do not leave this office. Capiche?

10:09.775 --> 10:12.069
You got it, Maury.
Capiche to the max!

10:12.153 --> 10:14.655
-I'm gonna go talk to Gavin.
-But we don't have time.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.532
I can't be stuck halfway through puberty.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.743
I don't wanna look like this
for the rest of my life.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.911
You mean like the assistant manager
at a bowling alley?

10:20.995 --> 10:22.079
That's what I look like?

10:22.163 --> 10:24.040
-Yeah, you really do.
-[door opens, closes]

10:24.457 --> 10:28.252
[moaning] Holy shit, man!

10:28.586 --> 10:31.297
See? I told you I could do things
Suzette couldn't.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.674
I'm a dude.
I'm familiar with the equipment.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.676
-Yeah...
-What is it, bro?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.677
I don't know.

10:36.761 --> 10:40.181
Is it a weird coincidence
that I made out with Matthew,

10:40.264 --> 10:41.557
and now you show up?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.392
I don't see the connection, man.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.561
I just think it's so funny to suck dick.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.687
Yeah, of course.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.189
It's hilar--
Oh, my God, Suzette!

10:48.272 --> 10:49.398
How could you?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.150
And with a couch cushion?

10:51.233 --> 10:52.943
You basically fucked a fart, Jay.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.905
Suzette, I swear to God,
all he did was suck me off.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.698
And mostly as a joke.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.284
It was Logan Paul-level hilarious.

11:00.368 --> 11:03.788
Jay, look at you.
You're literally in a closet.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.414
What the hell are you doing?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.792
I don't know! Everybody wants me!

11:07.875 --> 11:10.461
I'm very confused. And hard again?

11:10.544 --> 11:12.505
[chuckles] Okay. Wow.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.798
Let me get this straight.

11:13.881 --> 11:18.052
While the students were engaging
in all kinds of debaucherous depravity,

11:18.135 --> 11:19.011
you were busy.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.763
Talking to the floating grandpa!

11:20.846 --> 11:22.640
This is the "Shane Lizard"?

11:22.723 --> 11:23.557
That's right.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.560
And then it says here that
you rolled away on golf balls.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.062
Oh, it's not the first time.

11:28.145 --> 11:31.440
I once made it to LaGuardia on marbles.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.067
Okay, I've heard enough.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.236
Steve, we're gonna have
to let you go.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.029
Okay, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.322
No, we're firing you.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.824
Cool! Out of which cannon?

11:39.907 --> 11:41.450
Steve! You are fired.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.704
Yeah, I'm fired up
to meet Nick Cannon, baby.

11:45.913 --> 11:49.041
Okay, I think I finally understand.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.584
Because of what I did,

11:50.668 --> 11:54.505
you never want me to come back
to this school... of fish.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.006
Close enough! I'll take it.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.300
I guess these fish don't like soda!

11:58.384 --> 12:00.094
[laughs] More for me.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.267
[sighs]

12:07.184 --> 12:09.729
Connie, since you took over
as Jessi's number one,

12:09.812 --> 12:12.398
things have gone off the rails.
Okay?

12:12.481 --> 12:14.775
I put together a projection
of what she'll look like

12:14.859 --> 12:16.902
if she continues on her current path.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.070
[all gasping]

12:18.154 --> 12:20.156
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, no!

12:20.239 --> 12:23.409
Her neck tat says "I love codeine"?

12:23.492 --> 12:25.953
We're doomed!
What a waste of genetic potential!

12:26.036 --> 12:27.288
[howling]

12:27.371 --> 12:29.582
It makes me want to throw my shit
against the wall!

12:29.665 --> 12:33.377
Well, I'm sorry. I just wanted to make
my Jess-bear feel good.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.629
Feeling good is not the only thing
that's important.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.590
We were supposed to be
the next Elizabeth Warren!

12:37.673 --> 12:39.800
We need to make a change.
That's why we've been working...

12:39.884 --> 12:41.802
-[door opens]
-...with an outside consultant.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.845
Oh, no.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.472
[Intellect Sphinx] This is Kitty.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.390
She's from the Depression Division.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.142
Not the Depression Kitty.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.810
Hello, everyone.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.188
It's so nice to be part of the team.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.147
Oh, come on!

12:53.230 --> 12:55.649
Get your velvet Froot Loop
out of my face!

12:57.693 --> 12:59.361
-[doorknob clicks]
-Uh, sir, you can't go--

12:59.445 --> 13:01.363
[shouts] Nick!
[softly] You shouldn't be here.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.700
You'll turn into a child weightlifter
with veiny cock arms.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.202
Hold on, you're Gavin's assistant?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.287
Can you get me a meeting with him?

13:08.370 --> 13:10.247
[laughing] Yeah, right.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.792
A meeting with Gavin?
You're funny, Nick.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.919
-You should do comedy.
-You got to get me in there.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.754
-You owe me.
-Oh, man.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.506
Okay, I'll slip Gavin your headshot.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.341
[Nick] Did you take that
while I was sleeping?

13:20.424 --> 13:24.553
Are you mad at Ty-Ty for snapping
a picky of Nicky

13:24.637 --> 13:26.514
taking a snooze in his Underoos?

13:26.597 --> 13:28.808
Tyler, please just get me
the meeting.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.851
Wow, Maury's office.

13:30.935 --> 13:34.730
"San Diego Bartending College,
certificate of attendance."

13:35.147 --> 13:37.233
Now, what would Maury's
password be?

13:37.316 --> 13:38.984
C-U-M, cum.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.653
Yeah, okay, that worked.
[gasps]

13:40.736 --> 13:41.821
"Andrew Glouberman.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.030
Classic pervert.

13:43.113 --> 13:46.617
Projected profession:
manager at a bowling alley.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.786
First girlfriend:
Missy Forman-Greenwald."

13:48.869 --> 13:50.538
Yes, "Missy Forman-Greenwald:

13:50.621 --> 13:52.081
burgeoning horny spaz.

13:52.164 --> 13:55.751
Projected profession:
Ambassador to the Moon." [gasps]

13:55.835 --> 13:58.921
"Still has a thing for Andrew Glouberman."

13:59.004 --> 14:03.092
[chuckles] Well, I wonder if they'll have
bowling alleys on the Moon.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.176
[laughs]

14:04.635 --> 14:05.678
Wait, was that...

14:06.929 --> 14:09.515
Hey, I can't find Jessi--
Oh, shit.

14:09.598 --> 14:10.766
Where the hell are they?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.601
These kids really are like dogs.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.103
-[Lorraine giggling]
-Oh, Lorraine.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.147
I'd like to cook you up in a spoon
and mainline you.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.149
It's time for a new approach.

14:19.233 --> 14:22.444
We just want things to be... easier.
Don't we?

14:22.820 --> 14:23.863
-Uh-huh.
-Yes.

14:23.946 --> 14:24.780
Yeah.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.240
I think so, too.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.410
I'd like to take over
as Jessi's number one.

14:29.493 --> 14:30.786
What? No!

14:30.870 --> 14:34.123
We can't hand Jessi over
to this pouty pussy!

14:34.206 --> 14:36.542
Connie, you had your...
[howling] opportunity.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.002
Let's not be rude.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.546
Some of us just aren't cut out
for this type of work.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.299
Connie, I have a cousin in Body Odor.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.800
He says they're hiring.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.010
Oh, that's it.

14:46.093 --> 14:49.138
I'm gonna piss in your lasagna,
Garfield.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.973
-[growling]
-[Jessi] Connie! Stop!

14:51.056 --> 14:52.725
Jessi! You can't be here!

14:52.808 --> 14:54.476
I-- I want to go with Kitty.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.478
-What? No!
-[chuckles softly]

14:56.562 --> 14:57.563
Kitty's right.

14:57.646 --> 15:01.942
I am so tired of fighting
and feeling bad.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.193
Oh, no!

15:03.277 --> 15:04.612
I can help you.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.031
No, you just make things worse.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.158
I've got it from here, love.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.910
[crying]

15:10.993 --> 15:15.247
Jessi, have you ever laid on your side,
facing away from the television...

15:15.331 --> 15:18.083
-[exhales deeply]
-...listening to a Friends marathon?

15:18.167 --> 15:22.588
It's raining outside
and you're wearing double socks.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.423
Yeah, let's do that.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.884
There you go, sugar plum.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.052
[farting] Oh!

15:28.135 --> 15:30.012
I'm sorry. I'm just so comfortable.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.472
That's okay.

15:31.555 --> 15:34.475
-Let go of everything.
-[Jessi snoring]

15:34.975 --> 15:35.809
Coach Steve?

15:35.893 --> 15:37.603
-Jay!
-What are you doing? What is this?

15:37.686 --> 15:39.647
Oh, I got fired. Did you not hear?

15:39.730 --> 15:41.732
-No.
-Yeah, I got fired big time.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.817
-From the school?
-Yeah, from the school.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.611
Not from Nick Cannon, you know,

15:45.694 --> 15:47.863
so for all intensive porpoises,

15:47.947 --> 15:49.073
I'm pretty bummed.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.741
Fuck, that sucks.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.534
Yeah, it really does, man.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.119
[exhales] I need some advice.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.413
Well, hit me, kiddo! Don't hit me!

15:56.497 --> 15:57.831
Well, last night

15:57.915 --> 16:00.250
I got a blowjob from a couch cushion.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.627
So far, of course.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.337
And now I feel weird about it, because,

16:03.420 --> 16:05.172
well, the cushion is a dude.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.256
-Cool!
-It is?

16:06.340 --> 16:07.883
I don't know. Did you like it?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.301
Yeah, I guess I did.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.971
He, like, said my name
in, like, a really cool way.

16:12.054 --> 16:12.972
How'd he do it?

16:13.222 --> 16:14.807
-"Jay"
-I get it.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.142
I mean, for someone to know your name?
Woof.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.603
-Yeah.
-Well, you know what I always say...

16:19.687 --> 16:20.771
Let's go Mets!

16:20.854 --> 16:21.772
That's it?

16:21.855 --> 16:23.065
It's just that simple?

16:23.148 --> 16:25.359
Even if it's not,
I can't offer you more.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.277
-Thanks, Steve.
-Thank you, Jay.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.029
Thanks for being my friend.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.949
It's gonna be weird not to be
Coach Steve anymore.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.617
I guess now, I'm just...

16:33.993 --> 16:34.827
Coach.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.663
Gavin, this is Nick--

16:37.746 --> 16:39.540
Yeah, I know who the fuck he is.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.166
Nick. I've seen your cock.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.918
-You have?
-And there's potential there.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.587
I'm gonna make it so big and thick,
it's gonna be a problem.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.631
I don't think he wants a problem cock.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.009
Don't speak unless you have
something to say.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.511
You know the kid who basted
Mary Kay Letourneau?

16:52.594 --> 16:53.429
Mine.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.514
I think Nick might be a little young
to remember--

16:55.597 --> 16:56.682
-Tyler!
-[thud]

16:57.057 --> 16:58.559
Nick, what do you want, huh?

16:58.642 --> 17:01.520
-A thick neck? A nice high ass?
-Huh?

17:01.603 --> 17:03.272
You wanna pistol-whip a dumb nun?

17:04.023 --> 17:07.067
I guess I'm more focused
on just cuming for the first time.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.277
Jesus Christ!

17:08.360 --> 17:09.570
-You haven't cum yet?
-No.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.530
Oh, man.
When I'm done with you...

17:11.613 --> 17:13.907
You know when a car crashes
into a fire hydrant?

17:13.991 --> 17:16.785
No, no, no. You know when
they power wash a sidewalk?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.955
No, no, no! You ever get mad at your mom
on Thanksgiving,

17:20.039 --> 17:22.207
and smash a jar of mayo against the wall?

17:22.291 --> 17:23.625
Goodness, not Diane!

17:23.709 --> 17:26.628
Tyler! I'm gonna pull that horn
out of your fucking head

17:26.712 --> 17:28.547
and finger fuck the hole.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.008
All right, um, this has been amazing.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.760
And so relaxing...

17:33.135 --> 17:34.261
Now, to make it official,

17:34.344 --> 17:37.389
I'm going to superglue your dick
to your stomach so you piss up your nose.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.559
[laughing] I'm kidding!

17:40.642 --> 17:41.977
You're so serious, Nick.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.271
Whoa! Relax!

17:44.354 --> 17:46.190
I think you're scaring him.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.901
Tyler, I move my heel, you die.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.153
All right, sweet lips,
I got your home address.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.073
I'll show up whenever the fuck I want.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.158
Oh, my God, it's him.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.826
Stan the man!

17:57.910 --> 18:01.121
How were the bright lights
of Las Vegas, Nevada?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.665
I'm not telling you.
You'll just make me feel shitty.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.125
Hey, Grace!

18:05.209 --> 18:07.127
Are we doing a cake for Linda's birthday?

18:07.211 --> 18:08.796
We did it two hours ago.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.172
Oh, I didn't realize.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.425
Yeah, 'cause I didn't need you telling me
it was gonna go straight to my hips.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.677
I like my ass and you can kiss it.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.304
I wouldn't mind,

18:17.513 --> 18:19.932
for I am in love with you, Grace.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.267
Yeesh.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.229
This feels so nice.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.649
You want to drink some more
soupy ice cream?

18:28.732 --> 18:29.691
Mmm. Okay.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.443
Mmm, yeah.

18:31.735 --> 18:32.694
That's right.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.029
How 'bout another blanket?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.072
I should get up.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.533
It's kind of weird to be in bed
in the middle of the day.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.326
No, it's not.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.620
Oh, you're a little heavy.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.539
I can't really move.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.542
Hello, Andrew.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.377
I thought we were rid of you.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.587
No, you can't get rid of me.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.631
That's why when you saw Leah,

18:52.714 --> 18:54.633
you still felt like a skeevy little--

18:54.716 --> 18:56.885
Creep? Pervert? Masturbator?

18:56.969 --> 18:58.178
Yeah, I get it.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.139
I jerk off quite a lot.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.474
But why do you have to be
such an asshole?

19:02.558 --> 19:03.433
[chuckles softly]

19:03.517 --> 19:05.644
Perhaps I'm too harsh sometimes,

19:05.727 --> 19:08.272
but I only want you to be
a better person.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.731
-You do?
-Of course.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.317
I don't want you to grow up
to be one of those men

19:12.401 --> 19:15.571
who wait six months
for a customized sex doll.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.657
Six months?
That seems like a ridiculously long time.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.576
Yeah, well, they have to get
the eyes right.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.411
That's not the point.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.579
Look, I get it.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.497
I want to be a good person too,
I do.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.540
I know you do.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.750
You see, we're not so different,
are we?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.544
-Come here.
-Why, what you gonna do to me?

19:30.627 --> 19:33.088
-I'm gonna give you a hug.
-Oh.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.340
Because you seem
like you need a friend.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.467
-This is nice, right?
-It really is.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.385
There you are.

19:38.468 --> 19:41.138
Jesus Christ, you're the horniest kid
I've ever met.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.724
-No! We were just-- It wasn't--
-It doesn't matter.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.726
We've got ten minutes to get you
out of here.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.477
But I do want the deets.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.021
Goodbye, Andrew.

19:49.104 --> 19:49.980
Goodbye...

19:50.063 --> 19:51.523
I don't think I ever got your name.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.442
You can call me Shane Lizard.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.943
That's what my friends call me.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.529
-You're friends with Coach Steve?
-Isn't everybody?

19:57.613 --> 19:58.447
No.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.992
[grunting, moaning]

20:02.075 --> 20:03.952
I am drained.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.621
Better than Brad, right?

20:05.704 --> 20:06.622
Well...

20:06.705 --> 20:07.956
It's different.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.083
I kind of like it with both of you.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.043
That's bullshit.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.545
If you say you like boy pillows
and girl pillows,

20:13.629 --> 20:15.380
it means you really just like
boy pillows.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.633
No, I like you so much, Suzette.

20:17.841 --> 20:20.052
In fact, I love you?

20:20.135 --> 20:22.387
Yeah, that sounds right.
I love you.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.765
Then prove it. Burn Brad.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.475
-What?
-If you love me,

20:26.558 --> 20:29.144
you'll light him on fire
and throw him in the garbage.

20:29.269 --> 20:32.231
But he's a good dude!
And he's part of our couch.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.150
Well, what's it gonna be, Jay?
Him or me?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.526
You can't have both.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.903
Ah, fuck!

20:37.986 --> 20:39.905
So Gavin's pretty great, huh?

20:39.988 --> 20:41.949
I don't know. He's really intense.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.325
Can I tell you a secret?

20:43.408 --> 20:46.119
When you're not around,
Gavin's actually pretty mean to me.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.246
Look what he did.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.206
[Nick] Is that a lit cigarette
in your butt?

20:49.289 --> 20:51.416
He calls it his "ass tray."

20:51.500 --> 20:52.376
My God.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.670
He's like the Suge Knight
of Hormone Monsters.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.005
Believe it or not,
I think I'd rather have you.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.882
Oh, Nicky, that's so nice,

20:58.966 --> 21:01.260
but I'm pretty sure
you don't have a choice.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.678
[Gavin] Tyler! Get in here!

21:02.761 --> 21:04.596
How the fuck do I minimize Safari?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.139
Sorry, Nick. I got to go.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.975
Ow, ee, aye, oh, ewe!

21:08.058 --> 21:09.559
And sometimes Y!

21:09.643 --> 21:11.228
Nick, we're running out of time.

21:11.311 --> 21:14.189
-We need to find Jessi now.
-But she could be anywhere.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.108
I think I know someone
who could help.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.693
[Maury] Connie, there you are.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.153
-Boys, this is Jessi's Hormone Monstress.
-Hello.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.446
-Ms. Monstress.
-Hey.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.824
We have to get these kids out.
Do you know where Jessi is?

21:23.907 --> 21:25.200
It's too late, Maury.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.786
They took my boo-boo
to the Depression Ward!

21:27.869 --> 21:30.038
Depression Ward? Jessi's depressed?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.999
I knew it. Looking back, I knew it.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.876
-Then why didn't you say anything?
-Oh, honey, it wasn't my place.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.963
We still have time to get her out,
but we need your help, Connie.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.465
Nuh-uh. I'd just make things worse.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.134
We can't leave Jessi here.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.635
-What will we do?
-[Rick] Yeah...

21:45.178 --> 21:46.638
What are you gonna do?

21:46.722 --> 21:48.598
Rick! I thought you retired.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.559
Yeah, but this place is great.

21:50.642 --> 21:54.021
I get my big coffee, I do my Sudoku,
eat some cake,

21:54.104 --> 21:56.023
can't miss Linda's birthday, baby!

21:56.106 --> 21:57.941
-[Nick] Okay.
-Constance, do you remember

21:58.025 --> 21:59.776
-your horny swearsies?
-Rick, honey.

21:59.860 --> 22:03.196
-I can never understand you.
-That's why they have subtitles.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.699
I think he's talking about
the Jizz-ocratic Oath.

22:06.033 --> 22:09.703
"I do solemnly swear to counsel,
develop,

22:09.786 --> 22:11.079
and make horny

22:11.163 --> 22:14.207
the adolescents of the tri-state area

22:14.291 --> 22:15.792
now and forever."

22:15.876 --> 22:17.753
The keyword is always.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.130
-I think he means forever.
-Rick, you're right!

22:20.213 --> 22:21.757
I sworesie!

22:21.840 --> 22:23.592
Now let's go help my Jessi!

22:24.051 --> 22:24.885
Watch this.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.388
Look at that,
that's awesome, baby.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.475
-[Nick] Jessi!
-Come on, baby, stop hiding!

22:31.558 --> 22:34.061
-[Andrew] Where are you?
-I can't see you but I can smell you.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.646
Oh, God, there are
a billion rooms in here!

22:37.064 --> 22:38.815
-[Connie] Jessi-bear!
-[Andrew] Where are you?

22:38.899 --> 22:40.025
What?

22:40.108 --> 22:42.152
-Nick? Andrew?
-Shh.

22:42.235 --> 22:45.072
You belong in here, with me.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.365
[Jessi] Let me out!

22:46.448 --> 22:47.491
Wait, did you hear that?

22:47.574 --> 22:49.826
Someone help! I need help!

22:49.910 --> 22:51.661
-I'm in here--
-[Andrew] It's her.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.872
There's no doorknob.
How do we open this thing?

22:53.955 --> 22:55.499
Maury, you still got that laser dick?

22:55.582 --> 22:57.584
You kidding me? Of course I do.
Let me see.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.836
Got the can opener dick,
my Cool Ranch dick,

22:59.920 --> 23:02.005
my dick that looks like U2's The Edge,

23:02.089 --> 23:04.007
my dick with a dick,
and here it is.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.133
I got an idea.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.010
Dance, pussy, dance!

23:07.094 --> 23:08.595
Ooh! Little red dot!

23:08.678 --> 23:11.014
Gimme! Little red dot!

23:11.098 --> 23:12.724
Oh, where'd you--?
No, stop!

23:13.058 --> 23:14.518
[bellowing]

23:15.352 --> 23:16.186
[grunts]

23:16.853 --> 23:18.688
-Get back here.
-[Connie] Keep fighting, baby!

23:18.772 --> 23:19.689
Let go of me!

23:20.232 --> 23:22.442
Let her go, you kitty bitch!

23:22.526 --> 23:23.402
Let go!

23:24.111 --> 23:25.445
[yowling]

23:25.904 --> 23:27.906
Yeah! The men saved her!

23:27.989 --> 23:28.824
Ugh.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.325
[all screaming[

23:31.576 --> 23:33.578
Oh, yes, we made it!

23:33.662 --> 23:35.956
Goddammit, pubes everywhere.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.666
Am I the only one
with pubes on them?

23:37.749 --> 23:39.167
You guys came looking for me.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.169
Of course we did, Jessi,
you're our friend.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.046
We didn't realize
you were depressed.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.048
And that's on us. But also on you.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.050
-Honey, you should have said something.
-Andrew.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.677
No, it's fine.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.470
I do need to figure some shit out.

23:50.554 --> 23:53.390
Interrupting, but do I have
any pubes on my back?

23:53.473 --> 23:56.268
Can one of you give me ride
to train station?

23:56.601 --> 23:58.395
[Jessi] Mom, I'm sorry.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.230
-You were right.
-Really?

24:00.313 --> 24:02.190
Wow. What am I right about?

24:02.274 --> 24:05.193
I do need help.
I want to talk to that therapist.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.779
Oh, Jessi, I'm so glad to hear that.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.490
-[sighs] You're not a shitshow, Mom.
-Thank you.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.784
-You're not too short-neck bitch either.
-Okay.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.745
And also, like, who knows if you
and Cantor Dina scissor each other.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.456
-What's scissoring?
-You don't know?

24:17.539 --> 24:20.750
Scissoring, it's like what lesbians do
to, like, get their vaginas to meet.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.128
-It was a word I wasn't familiar with--
-Like two scissors--

24:23.211 --> 24:25.213
You know what, sweetie,
let's save this for therapy.

24:26.631 --> 24:29.009
[sighs deeply]
Okay, you can do this, Jay.

24:29.384 --> 24:30.302
[Suzette moaning]

24:30.385 --> 24:32.012
-What the fuck?
-Jay!

24:32.345 --> 24:34.639
I couldn't help it.
She was irresistible.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.058
She's still heavy with your musk, bro.

24:37.142 --> 24:40.520
And if you want Brad,
then I want him, too.

24:40.604 --> 24:41.688
Why don't you join us?

24:41.771 --> 24:43.773
We want to suck the honey
out of your baklava.

24:43.857 --> 24:47.360
If everybody wants me,
then they can have me!

24:47.694 --> 24:48.987
-[Jay] Whoo!
-[Suzette moaning]

24:49.070 --> 24:50.030
[Brad] Oh, bro!

24:50.113 --> 24:51.323
-Jay!
-[Brad] Yes, bro.

24:51.698 --> 24:52.782
[barking]

24:53.658 --> 24:55.702
Proud!

24:55.785 --> 24:57.579
I'm proud of Jay.

24:57.954 --> 24:58.788
LUNA LANES
BOWLING

25:02.042 --> 25:04.628
Well, hello, Ambassador Forman-Greenwald.

25:04.711 --> 25:05.962
Well, well, well!

25:06.046 --> 25:08.006
Bowling Alley Manager Glouberman.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.467
I'm so glad you found out
I was still into you

25:10.550 --> 25:12.385
and completely over Nathan Fillion.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.847
Sir, if you need me, I'll be flinging shit
out of the window by hand,

25:15.931 --> 25:17.974
because that's the way we do it
here on the Moon.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.643
You're goddamn right, you loser.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.394
So, what do you think, Andrew?

25:21.478 --> 25:22.854
Shall we hump a lot?

25:22.938 --> 25:25.690
All right, my friend.
Let's grip it and rip it.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.776
No, no, no,
I don't want to do this now.

25:27.859 --> 25:30.445
But you found out Missy's still into you.
Pump your stump.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.405
Actually, I don't think
I'm gonna jerk off

25:32.489 --> 25:34.366
inches from my best friend's face tonight.

25:34.449 --> 25:35.408
I am better than that.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.744
-You gonna go to the bathroom?
-In the middle of the night.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.329
-Good call.
-I'm gonna run the water.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.957
Goodnight, sweet perv.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.500
Goodnight.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.128
[rattling]

25:47.212 --> 25:49.297
Who's there? Tyler?

25:49.381 --> 25:50.799
Oh, shit. Gavin?

25:52.926 --> 25:56.179
Hello, my tasty little tortellini.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.014
Connie? What are you doing here?

25:58.098 --> 26:00.684
I'm your new Hormone Monster.

26:00.767 --> 26:03.603
What? That's not possible,
I'm a boy.

26:03.687 --> 26:04.688
Not for long.

26:04.771 --> 26:07.774
-I'm here to make you a man.
-I'm listening.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.277
Baby, you are in very good hands.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.194
I am?

26:11.486 --> 26:13.071
Yeah. Your own.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.699
Oh my God, this is happening!

26:16.074 --> 26:18.785
Not how I Imagined it
or even wanted it at all, but...

26:18.868 --> 26:20.787
Oh, this feels really good.

26:20.870 --> 26:22.622
That's right, sweet lips.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.959
You're gonna be president of cum-edy!

26:26.042 --> 26:27.544
