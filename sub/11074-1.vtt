01:54.563 --> 01:58.158
Today, while the earth shakes
beneath the heels of marching troops...

01:58.333 --> 02:00.563
...while a great portion
of the world trembles...

02:00.736 --> 02:03.296
...before the threats
of acquisitive, power-mad men...

02:03.472 --> 02:05.940
...we of America have little time
to remember...

02:06.108 --> 02:08.668
...an astounding era in our own
recent history...

02:08.844 --> 02:12.974
...an era which will grow more and more
incredible with each passing generation...

02:13.148 --> 02:18.051
...until someday people will say
it never could've happened at all.

02:18.220 --> 02:20.381
April, 1918.

02:20.556 --> 02:23.889
Almost a million American young men
are engaged in a struggle...

02:24.059 --> 02:28.519
...which they have been told
will make the world safe for democracy.

02:54.056 --> 02:58.220
- You always come into a rathole like that?
- What do you want me to do, knock?

03:02.598 --> 03:04.657
Cost me the last cigarette I had.

03:04.833 --> 03:09.099
Well, can I offer you a nice Turkish
prettiest? Number-nine cork tip.

03:11.106 --> 03:12.403
Yeah.

03:12.574 --> 03:14.371
Hey. Hey, where'd you get those?

03:14.543 --> 03:17.774
A friend of mine in Mineola
sends me a fresh batch every week.

03:17.946 --> 03:19.470
Look at that.

03:19.648 --> 03:22.549
Them cooties is getting desperate.
They're feeding off tobacco.

03:22.718 --> 03:24.811
How much can a cootie smoke?

03:25.787 --> 03:27.311
Got a light?

03:35.364 --> 03:39.630
There's 10,000 shell holes around here, and
everybody's gotta come diving into this one.

03:39.801 --> 03:41.393
No privacy in this war anymore.

03:41.570 --> 03:43.504
Sorry. I didn't know anyone was in here.

03:43.672 --> 03:45.833
Ought to put up a sign:
"No hunting, shooting or trespassing. "

03:49.912 --> 03:54.349
There goes me prettiest number-nine
cork tips. Where are they?

03:56.652 --> 03:59.849
- What's the matter, kid?
- Nothing.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.887
You scared?

04:02.057 --> 04:03.786
Yes, I am.

04:04.760 --> 04:08.059
- No heart, huh?
- I'm beginning to think so.

04:08.230 --> 04:10.027
At least I haven't any heart for this.

04:10.199 --> 04:13.066
I hoped this business would be
over with before I got here.

04:13.235 --> 04:16.829
- What are you, a college kid?
- I just finished law school.

04:17.072 --> 04:20.564
A lawyer, huh? Can you think of anything
that can get us out of this hole?

04:20.742 --> 04:22.232
He wouldn't if he could.

04:22.411 --> 04:25.073
He's the type that cheers back home.
When they get here...

04:25.247 --> 04:27.340
- ... and things get tough, they fold.
- Shut up.

04:27.516 --> 04:29.882
- I'm talking to him.
- And I'm talking to you.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.781
I don't like heroes or bigmouths.

04:31.954 --> 04:33.854
We're all scared.
And why shouldn't we be?

04:34.022 --> 04:36.149
What do you think we use
in war, water pistols?

04:36.658 --> 04:38.455
You're all right, kid.

04:38.627 --> 04:41.323
I like guys who are honest
with themselves. Stay that way.

04:41.496 --> 04:44.863
Come on. Looks like it's quieted down.

04:54.142 --> 04:57.737
Mailman, boys! Come and get it!
Goodies from home!

04:58.247 --> 04:59.874
- Rothmore.
- Here, right here.

05:00.048 --> 05:02.175
- Fletcher.
- Here I am.

05:02.351 --> 05:04.285
- Tilton.
- Here.

05:05.420 --> 05:07.183
- Aloysius Toohey.
- Here.

05:07.356 --> 05:08.755
Bartlett.

05:08.924 --> 05:10.551
Right, buddy.

05:16.431 --> 05:19.798
Here's mine. Here you are, big and
good-looking. Try your luck on those.

05:19.968 --> 05:21.162
- Thanks.
- That's for you.

05:21.336 --> 05:23.236
Yeah, that's all I've been getting.

05:23.405 --> 05:25.805
Anything good, I'll split it with you.

05:29.311 --> 05:30.835
Oh, now, look at that.

05:31.013 --> 05:34.380
Thousands of dames writing us letters
that are supposed to pep us up.

05:34.549 --> 05:36.517
Get a load of that kisser.

05:38.053 --> 05:40.851
Hey, somebody must've sent him
some dough.

05:43.325 --> 05:44.917
Hey, now, that's more like it.

05:45.093 --> 05:46.788
- Very pretty.
- Yeah.

05:46.962 --> 05:51.763
A million guys in the Army, a babe
like her has gotta pick out a mug like him.

05:51.933 --> 05:54.766
- Who she ain't met.
- When you write, ask if she has a friend.

05:54.936 --> 05:57.598
Put in, "Having a wonderful time.
Wish we was in Mineola. "

05:57.773 --> 05:59.434
What do you mean, "we"?

06:02.611 --> 06:06.206
Bugle too vulgar for you guys?
Maybe you need a harp to call you out.

06:06.381 --> 06:08.349
Come on! Move out!

06:09.584 --> 06:11.745
What's the matter? You hard of hearing?

06:11.920 --> 06:14.218
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Keep your shirt on.

06:14.389 --> 06:17.017
When you get an order in the Army,
buddy, you jump.

06:17.192 --> 06:20.684
Like you did when you worked for my dad,
and he caught you stealing nickels?

06:20.862 --> 06:23.194
I ain't working for him.
I ain't working for you.

06:23.365 --> 06:25.526
Yeah, well, you might be.

06:25.701 --> 06:26.929
I'm gonna give you a break.

06:27.102 --> 06:29.570
I'll let you stand behind the bar
with your medals on...

06:29.738 --> 06:31.831
...and tell the drunks how
you won the war.

06:32.007 --> 06:33.201
Fall in!

06:33.375 --> 06:36.435
- I said, fall in!
- Where's the sergeant?

06:41.049 --> 06:42.846
Come on. Shake it up! Shake it up!

06:43.018 --> 06:46.510
Someday I'll catch that ape without
those stripes on and kick his teeth out.

06:46.688 --> 06:48.280
Fall in.

06:48.457 --> 06:50.482
Come on, move along!

06:50.726 --> 06:52.956
You must be quite a guy back home.

06:53.128 --> 06:55.096
I do all right.

07:04.039 --> 07:07.304
What is this armistice they've
been talking about the past four days?

07:07.476 --> 07:10.502
It's just another rumor.
This brawl's gonna go on forever.

07:10.679 --> 07:14.012
I ever get back, I'll have a swell law office
in the Woolworth Building.

07:14.182 --> 07:16.582
Have it all picked out on the 28th floor.

07:16.752 --> 07:19.516
You can see the whole city,
the bay, Brooklyn.

07:19.688 --> 07:21.747
What do you wanna look at Brooklyn for?

07:21.923 --> 07:25.051
- What are you going to do, George?
- Just a minute.

07:27.195 --> 07:31.495
That sucker jumped 3 feet in the air
and come down stiff as a board.

07:31.666 --> 07:34.134
Me? I'll still be in the saloon business.

07:34.603 --> 07:36.195
Prohibition law goes in next year.

07:36.371 --> 07:38.931
It's one thing to pass a law,
another to make it work.

07:39.107 --> 07:42.634
- There'll always be guys wanting to drink.
- They'll enforce that law.

07:42.811 --> 07:44.403
No, they haven't got a chance.

07:44.579 --> 07:46.069
How about you, Eddie?

07:46.248 --> 07:48.512
I'm gonna get my old job back
in that garage.

07:48.683 --> 07:50.708
Save my money,
someday have a shop of my own.

07:50.886 --> 07:52.478
It's my idea of heaven, boys.

07:52.654 --> 07:55.919
A grease bucket, a wrench
and a cracked cylinder.

07:56.224 --> 07:58.192
You wanna make a living the hard way.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.796
All I know is, I don't want
any more trouble. I've had some.

08:05.634 --> 08:07.568
What's the matter, Harvard?
Lose the Heinie?

08:07.736 --> 08:10.068
No, but he looks like a kid
about 15 years old.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.900
He won't be 16.

08:18.780 --> 08:23.410
Hey, it's all over, boys, cease firing!
The armistice has been signed!

08:26.154 --> 08:27.883
Woolworth Building, here I come!

08:28.056 --> 08:30.149
It's gonna be good to look
into a motor again.

08:31.359 --> 08:34.885
You know, I like this.
I think I'll take it with me.

08:36.231 --> 08:39.631
1919. The war is over,
and the people of New York...

08:39.801 --> 08:43.328
...are tiring of the constant triumphal
procession of returning troops.

08:43.505 --> 08:45.405
And still not all of them are back.

08:45.574 --> 08:49.032
There is alarming news that women's skirts
are going to become shorter...

08:49.211 --> 08:51.611
...already they are 6 inches
above the ankle.

08:51.780 --> 08:54.214
Bobbed hair is introduced,
but very timidly.

08:54.382 --> 08:57.374
A young upstart named Jack Dempsey
will meet Jess Willard...

08:57.552 --> 08:59.782
...for the heavyweight championship
of the world.

08:59.955 --> 09:03.356
People are talking about the high cost
of living. Everything is going up:

09:03.658 --> 09:06.058
Food, rent, clothing, taxes.

09:06.228 --> 09:09.755
The Prohibition amendment is ratified
by the necessary 36 states...

09:09.931 --> 09:11.831
...and becomes the law of the land.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.491
People are dancing
to the strains of "Dardanella. "

09:14.669 --> 09:16.136
Finally, late in the year...

09:16.304 --> 09:20.866
...the last detachments of the American
forces come back from policing the Rhine...

09:21.042 --> 09:24.773
...almost forgotten by all
but their relatives and friends.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.658
It's Eddie Bartlett!

09:46.835 --> 09:49.770
- You ain't dead?
- If I am, they forgot to bury me.

09:49.938 --> 09:53.396
Well, when you didn't come back
with the others, we thought you was dead.

09:53.575 --> 09:55.805
They kept me in Germany
to straighten things out.

09:55.977 --> 09:57.774
- Danny Green still live here?
- Sure.

09:57.946 --> 10:01.939
But if you're thinking of moving in again,
the rent's higher than it used to be.

10:02.117 --> 10:06.349
- Oh, yeah? How much?
- Four dollars from each of you every week.

10:06.521 --> 10:07.920
That's fair enough.

10:08.089 --> 10:10.148
I won't have it anyway.

10:42.991 --> 10:44.515
Here's your coffee, Danny.

10:44.693 --> 10:47.184
Oh, thanks.

10:47.963 --> 10:50.397
- Tired?
- Yeah.

10:51.199 --> 10:54.532
I drove some goofer
all over Times Square...

10:55.003 --> 10:56.527
Eddie!

10:56.705 --> 10:58.036
- How are you?
- Hello, Danny.

10:58.206 --> 10:59.969
- I'm glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.

11:00.141 --> 11:03.008
- Well, I thought that-
- Yeah, I know. You thought I was dead.

11:03.244 --> 11:04.472
Yeah.

11:04.646 --> 11:06.739
Gee, kid, I'm glad to see you.

11:06.915 --> 11:09.748
Yeah, I- I thought you was bumped off.

11:09.918 --> 11:14.184
Why didn't you tell me you was coming? I'd
have went down to the boat to meet you.

11:14.356 --> 11:17.189
Well, you could've wrote to me
if you'd have tried hard.

11:17.359 --> 11:20.328
- Who's gonna read it to you?
- I got friends.

11:20.829 --> 11:23.320
- Well, the same cheesy old joint, huh?
- Yeah.

11:23.498 --> 11:27.093
- You look healthy.
- Oh, I feel fine now that the war's over.

11:27.268 --> 11:30.999
Eddie, you never saw a sicker guy
in your life the day I was-

11:31.172 --> 11:33.037
When I got my number for the draft.

11:33.208 --> 11:36.666
Flat feet, peepers all gone.
I even had a touch of the palsy.

11:36.845 --> 11:39.473
- No bad heart?
- Well, I was working up to that.

11:39.648 --> 11:42.515
- Same old Danny. How's hacking?
- Oh, bad.

11:42.684 --> 11:45.118
- Yeah?
- Things ain't good in the taxi business.

11:45.286 --> 11:47.345
Everybody's walking
where they wanna go.

11:47.522 --> 11:49.319
Hey, how's things in France?

11:49.491 --> 11:52.153
Oh, I'm glad you reminded me.
Brought you a souvenir.

11:52.327 --> 11:55.956
You needn't have done that.
I didn't expect anything. What is it?

11:56.498 --> 11:58.489
German trench helmet. Hope it fits.

11:58.667 --> 12:01.636
I had an awful time finding
a Heinie with your head size.

12:01.803 --> 12:04.271
Say, that's swell.

12:05.173 --> 12:07.869
It just doesn't fit.
It's a little too small.

12:08.043 --> 12:10.568
I can send it to the cleaners
and get it stretched.

12:10.745 --> 12:14.078
- How do I look?
- You're just the girl to wear it.

12:14.849 --> 12:18.512
Oh, boy, I'm gonna give this to my kids.
You know, if I ever have any.

12:18.687 --> 12:20.154
Tell them how I captured it.

12:20.321 --> 12:22.516
Charging the enemy!

12:23.692 --> 12:27.526
I gotta hide this so no one will cop it.
Where will I put it?

12:28.196 --> 12:29.424
Here's the place.

12:29.597 --> 12:31.724
She never sweeps under here.

12:32.634 --> 12:34.261
Can you see it?

12:35.503 --> 12:37.095
Oh, yeah.

12:38.273 --> 12:40.571
You hungry, Eddie?
Come on out, we'll eat.

12:40.742 --> 12:43.040
I got a meal ticket.
We'll shoot it full of holes.

12:43.211 --> 12:45.042
- I'll make it look like a sieve.
- Come on.

12:45.213 --> 12:48.876
Wait, I gotta go over to the garage,
get my old job back. Run me over?

12:49.050 --> 12:50.847
Sure, in the cab.

12:51.019 --> 12:52.316
Hey, Eddie.

12:52.487 --> 12:54.387
Did you learn to parlez-vous?

12:54.556 --> 12:56.080
Just enough.

13:07.001 --> 13:09.265
- Hey, bud, where's Fletcher?
- In the office.

13:09.437 --> 13:11.029
Oh, thanks.

13:12.373 --> 13:16.742
That guy thinks he'll get my job just because
he's got a uniform on. He used to work here.

13:16.911 --> 13:19.573
Those monkeys are gonna find out
what a picnic they had...

13:19.748 --> 13:21.613
...on Uncle Sam's dough while we worked.

13:21.783 --> 13:23.216
- Hello, Mr. Fletcher.
- Hi.

13:23.384 --> 13:25.284
- When did you blow in?
- Just now.

13:25.453 --> 13:26.920
- Sure good to be back.
- I'll bet.

13:27.088 --> 13:29.682
- What are you gonna do?
- Rest a few days, see the boys.

13:29.858 --> 13:31.450
- Then I'll be ready to work.
- Fine.

13:31.626 --> 13:33.890
What are you gonna do?
Where you gonna work?

13:34.062 --> 13:35.962
What do you mean,
"Where am I gonna work?"

13:36.131 --> 13:39.931
- I was gonna come back here.
- Sorry, Eddie. I haven't anything for you.

13:40.135 --> 13:41.329
What?

13:41.503 --> 13:44.700
Well, wait a minute.
Maybe I'm in the wrong garage.

13:44.873 --> 13:47.774
What was that line about my job
always waiting for me?

13:47.942 --> 13:51.434
Times have changed. That boy over there
has been working almost two years.

13:51.613 --> 13:54.912
What do you want me to do?
Can him just because you came back?

13:56.951 --> 13:58.384
No.

13:58.720 --> 14:01.245
No, I couldn't ask you
to do that, could I?

14:01.956 --> 14:04.186
All right. Thanks.

14:04.692 --> 14:09.026
Left, I had a good job
And I left, left

14:09.197 --> 14:10.960
Don't tell me you won't be with us.

14:11.132 --> 14:13.828
If you brought a band and a gun,
you might've got the job.

14:14.002 --> 14:16.493
I don't need any gun, you-

14:18.907 --> 14:20.738
Two for one.

14:23.978 --> 14:27.379
Back in this country,
the boys who had returned from overseas...

14:27.549 --> 14:32.680
...begin to find out that the world has moved
on during the time they spent in France.

14:32.854 --> 14:34.754
Sorry, buddy. Nothing doing.

14:34.923 --> 14:38.723
Everywhere things have changed,
but particularly in New York.

14:38.893 --> 14:43.762
The old Broadway is only a memory,
gone are many of the famous landmarks.

14:43.932 --> 14:47.231
For already, America is feeling
the effects of Prohibition.

14:47.402 --> 14:51.702
There's a concentrated effort at
readjustment to normal peacetime activity...

14:51.873 --> 14:54.740
...but unemployment, coming in the wake
of the wartime boom...

14:54.909 --> 14:56.809
...is beginning to grip the country.

14:56.978 --> 15:01.540
The soldiers find they've returned to face,
on a different front, the same old struggle:

15:01.716 --> 15:04.184
The struggle to survive.

15:09.457 --> 15:11.322
Yes, sir, where to?

15:11.492 --> 15:12.891
Where to?

15:13.061 --> 15:16.588
- How about a flat rate back to France?
- Oh, hi, Eddie.

15:16.764 --> 15:18.163
How are you?

15:18.533 --> 15:21.764
- You didn't land yourself no job, huh?
- Somebody must've told you.

15:21.936 --> 15:23.870
No. I figured that all out by myself.

15:24.038 --> 15:26.700
You know, on account of your face.
You look kind of tired.

15:27.375 --> 15:30.435
I am tired, Danny.
Tired of being pushed around.

15:30.612 --> 15:34.605
Tired of having doors slammed in my face.
Tired of being another guy back from France.

15:34.782 --> 15:36.511
Take it easy, Eddie. Take it easy.

15:36.684 --> 15:38.174
I can't, Danny. I can't.

15:38.353 --> 15:41.550
I can't go around shadowboxing anymore.
I gotta find something to do.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.315
- I've gotta.
- Wait a minute.

15:43.491 --> 15:46.756
Don't- Don't break that.
The landlady will charge us for it.

15:46.928 --> 15:49.988
If you gotta break something,
smack me on the chin. It's cheaper.

15:50.164 --> 15:52.928
Look, Eddie.
I only use my cab 12 hours a day.

15:53.101 --> 15:57.094
The rest of the time, it's laying in the garage.
Why don't you hustle it the other 12?

15:57.272 --> 16:01.436
We'll split the gas and the oil,
and you got yourself a job.

16:04.512 --> 16:07.003
It may work out, Danny. It may work out.

16:07.515 --> 16:09.278
I gotta do something.

16:09.584 --> 16:11.347
- Who's there?
- Mrs. Gray.

16:11.519 --> 16:13.419
We ain't home!

16:15.423 --> 16:18.984
Here's a letter for you, Eddie.
Forward all the way from France.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.288
- There's three cents' postage due.
- Put it on the bill.

16:22.463 --> 16:26.263
- Don't think I won't.
- And don't you think I think you won't.

16:30.805 --> 16:33.035
Well, who's that from?

16:38.146 --> 16:39.738
Oh, say, she's pretty.

16:40.615 --> 16:43.550
- One of them French peasants, huh?
- No, it's an American gal.

16:43.718 --> 16:45.845
Lives in Mineola, Long Island.

16:47.188 --> 16:50.180
- Well, I won't hold that against her.
- Danny...

16:50.358 --> 16:53.850
- ... how far is it to Mineola?
- Depends upon if you know the way.

16:54.028 --> 16:57.464
For a wise guy, it's 15 miles.
For a gilpin, it's 30 miles.

16:57.632 --> 17:01.124
Pal, you're driving to Mineola. I think
a change of scenery will do me good.

17:01.302 --> 17:04.237
This kind of scenery
never did anybody any harm.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.965
- Got enough gas?
- Gas?

17:07.141 --> 17:09.769
Old Bridget can make Mineola
on her reputation.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.411
Let's go.

17:21.055 --> 17:23.454
- Wait here, my man.
- Hey...

17:23.624 --> 17:28.152
- ... where do you get that "my man" stuff?
- I'm trying to make an impression, you dope.

17:29.263 --> 17:31.561
Hello. Does Jean Sherman live here?

17:31.733 --> 17:35.499
- Yes. What is it you want? I'm her mother.
- I'm- I'm Eddie Bartlett.

17:35.670 --> 17:37.194
Eddie Bart-

17:37.372 --> 17:39.340
Oh, come in.

17:39.507 --> 17:43.534
- Eddie Bartlett, her dream soldier.
- Her what?

17:43.711 --> 17:47.545
That's her name for you. She'll be thrilled
to death to see you when she gets home.

17:47.715 --> 17:49.706
- She's not here?
- She'll be back any minute.

17:49.884 --> 17:52.182
- Won't you come in?
- That's nice, Mrs. Sherman.

17:52.353 --> 17:54.821
This is my buddy, Danny Green.
He drove me down here.

17:54.989 --> 17:56.547
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

17:56.724 --> 17:58.419
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

17:58.593 --> 18:00.254
You see?

18:03.331 --> 18:05.196
Jean and I often used to talk about you.

18:05.366 --> 18:09.302
And at night we'd pray for you.
We felt almost as though you were family.

18:09.470 --> 18:12.337
Sometimes Jean would play the piano.
She's very talented.

18:12.507 --> 18:15.874
We'd sing hymns.
She got her voice from me.

18:16.044 --> 18:19.172
- I'll get you some more.
- No, thanks. This is quite enough, really.

18:19.347 --> 18:21.907
Don't be bashful. I'll be right back.

18:25.653 --> 18:29.851
If I drink another glass of lemonade,
it's gonna run out of my ears.

18:30.024 --> 18:32.015
Why didn't she think
to offer us a sandwich?

18:32.193 --> 18:33.854
She's probably building up to that.

18:34.028 --> 18:36.428
I'm beginning to wonder
if this trip was worthwhile.

18:36.597 --> 18:38.064
Let me be the judge of that.

18:38.232 --> 18:42.225
Find out right away if she's got a friend.
If she has, give me the great big buildup.

18:42.403 --> 18:44.166
One thing at a time. Now, look...

18:44.338 --> 18:46.898
...when this gal gets here,
watch what you say and do.

18:47.075 --> 18:49.066
Way I figure it, she's got plenty of class.

18:49.243 --> 18:52.440
You hear what her mother said?
She goes to school, sings and dances.

18:52.613 --> 18:54.080
Look, that means she's no mug.

18:54.248 --> 18:57.445
Now, that kind of material
needs plenty of delicate handling.

18:57.618 --> 19:00.143
As a matter of fact,
the more I think about this...

19:00.321 --> 19:02.482
...the more I think
you should take a long walk.

19:02.657 --> 19:04.488
Hey, wait a minute.

19:04.659 --> 19:07.560
Hey, Ma, I got an A in algebra!

19:09.163 --> 19:10.391
Hello.

19:10.565 --> 19:12.294
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:12.467 --> 19:16.995
- Well, are you waiting for somebody?
- Yeah, waiting for your big sister.

19:17.171 --> 19:20.572
My big sister?
Why, I haven't got any big sister.

19:22.210 --> 19:24.735
- No big sister?
- Wait a minute.

19:24.912 --> 19:28.541
- Don't tell me you're Eddie? Eddie Bartlett?
- Yeah.

19:28.716 --> 19:31.776
My dream soldier.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.421
Oh, I wondered if I was ever
gonna get to see you.

19:34.589 --> 19:37.353
Oh, Mr. Bartlett, you look
just like I pictured you.

19:37.525 --> 19:41.291
Brave, strong, romantic
and handsome.

19:43.498 --> 19:45.830
Speaking of looks, how about this?

19:47.435 --> 19:49.801
That was taken when
I was in our high-school play.

19:50.438 --> 19:52.463
It was The Fortune Teller
by Victor Herbert.

19:55.276 --> 19:58.837
- But you said that you sang and danced.
- I do.

19:59.113 --> 20:00.273
Where?

20:00.448 --> 20:04.009
I sing in the choir every Sunday, and
I had the lead in our high-school play.

20:04.185 --> 20:08.212
Once in a while, I sing and dance
for the Elks Club. Everybody says I'm good.

20:08.389 --> 20:11.449
- Would you like to hear me?
- Oh, no, no. No, thanks.

20:11.626 --> 20:13.218
I have absolutely no ear for music.

20:13.494 --> 20:16.986
- Well, it was nice to see you.
- You aren't really leaving, are you?

20:17.165 --> 20:19.998
We gotta get back to town,
important meeting with the general.

20:20.168 --> 20:23.296
Aren't you gonna tell me about the war
and how you suffered?

20:23.471 --> 20:24.733
Honey...

20:24.906 --> 20:26.840
...you'll never know how I've suffered.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.168
So long.

20:28.342 --> 20:29.673
Well, will I see you again?

20:29.844 --> 20:31.607
- I'll call you.
- When?

20:31.779 --> 20:34.577
In two or three years,
when you get to be a great big girl.

20:34.749 --> 20:36.512
- So long.
- Bye.

20:36.684 --> 20:39.619
You should've stayed
and helped her with her homework.

20:40.388 --> 20:43.585
1920. For the first two weeks of the year...

20:43.758 --> 20:46.283
...men can still get a drink
more or less publicly...

20:46.494 --> 20:50.555
...because although the 18th Amendment
is in effect, the law has no teeth.

20:51.065 --> 20:54.899
But on the 16th of January,
the Volstead Act takes effect...

20:55.136 --> 20:57.661
...and traffic in liquor
goes completely undercover...

20:58.005 --> 21:00.132
...to stay there for many long years.

21:00.641 --> 21:03.474
The word "speakeasy"
begins to appear in our language.

21:03.811 --> 21:08.305
And the forces of the underworld, who
best know how to operate outside the law...

21:08.482 --> 21:13.784
...are moving in on a new source of revenue,
the magnitude of which no man dare guess.

21:21.729 --> 21:23.390
Sixty cents.

21:23.564 --> 21:24.997
Say, will you do me a favor?

21:25.166 --> 21:28.431
Take these into Henderson's and collect
12 bucks. Ask for Panama Smith.

21:28.603 --> 21:30.127
- What's her name?
- Panama Smith.

21:30.304 --> 21:32.272
- I'm taking these across the street.
- Okay.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.704
- Meet you back here at the cab.
- Yeah.

21:37.945 --> 21:40.812
Hey, Panama, how about something
to go with this ginger ale?

21:41.015 --> 21:42.243
On the way.

21:43.951 --> 21:46.010
- You Panama Smith?
- That's me, brother.

21:46.187 --> 21:47.552
Package for you. Twelve bucks.

21:47.788 --> 21:49.415
Oh, yes. The meat.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.221
Come on.

21:51.392 --> 21:54.361
Hey, what are you trying to do?
Get us both tossed in the cooler?

21:54.528 --> 21:56.257
There's a law against that dry goods.

21:56.430 --> 21:59.194
I don't know what's in here,
and I don't care. Twelve bucks.

21:59.367 --> 22:01.665
Just a minute. Just a minute.

22:01.836 --> 22:04.532
You bootleggers are gonna learn
the law is being enforced.

22:04.705 --> 22:05.967
What are you talking about?

22:06.941 --> 22:09.273
You're under arrest
for violating the Volstead Act.

22:09.443 --> 22:10.910
I don't know anything about it.

22:11.078 --> 22:15.481
We know. You came in with a load of soda
water, and on the way it distilled into gin.

22:15.650 --> 22:17.515
And you were delivering it for a friend.

22:17.685 --> 22:19.710
- That's right.
- You can tell it to the judge.

22:19.887 --> 22:21.514
Come on. You too, Panama.

22:21.689 --> 22:24.089
- What for, snooper?
- For handling this laughing soup.

22:24.258 --> 22:27.318
- This means a padlock for you.
- But I'm not handling it. He had it.

22:27.495 --> 22:30.953
And now he has it. Besides, I didn't know
anything about it. Did I, buster?

22:32.266 --> 22:33.426
That's the way it was.

22:33.601 --> 22:37.059
I drive a guy in my cab, he asked me
to deliver that to a customer in here.

22:37.238 --> 22:39.331
I forget his name.
I asked if she knows him.

22:39.507 --> 22:41.941
You got me crying for both of you.
Now, come on.

22:42.109 --> 22:44.043
I delivered for a guy
who's waiting outside.

22:44.211 --> 22:46.372
This guy's on the up and up.
He's no bootlegger.

22:46.547 --> 22:49.448
- I never saw him before.
- You see him this time. That's enough.

22:49.617 --> 22:51.380
Now, get out of here.

22:51.886 --> 22:53.786
Hey, buster, who do you know?

22:53.954 --> 22:56.718
- I know a lawyer.
- It'd be better if you knew a judge.

22:56.891 --> 22:58.916
Panama Smith, in view of the evidence...

22:59.093 --> 23:01.789
...presented in your behalf
by your codefendant...

23:01.962 --> 23:04.556
...and because the arresting
officers failed to detect...

23:04.732 --> 23:08.600
...you actually selling intoxicating
liquors, I find you not guilty.

23:08.769 --> 23:13.297
Edward Bartlett, I find you guilty
of violation of the Volstead Act.

23:13.741 --> 23:16.369
I fine you $100 or 60 days in jail.

23:18.679 --> 23:22.809
Order. And I give you warning that another
offense won't be treated so lightly.

23:23.484 --> 23:24.781
Court is adjourned.

23:25.486 --> 23:27.613
Thanks, buster. Thanks a lot.

23:27.788 --> 23:29.722
I'll do the same for you someday.

23:32.059 --> 23:34.527
Well, how do you like that dame?

23:34.695 --> 23:36.162
"Thanks," she says.

23:37.665 --> 23:41.601
I help her beat the rap, and she never even
asked if I got enough dough for the fine.

23:41.769 --> 23:44.067
What a first-class gilpin
I turned out to be.

23:45.072 --> 23:46.835
A hundred bucks.

23:47.007 --> 23:49.066
That judge might as well
have said 10,000.

23:49.276 --> 23:51.904
I'd hock the cab, Eddie,
only it's already in hock.

23:52.079 --> 23:53.671
I guess I'm not a very good lawyer.

23:53.848 --> 23:55.475
Oh, you're all right, kid.

23:55.716 --> 23:58.184
You just went to bat
for the wrong guy, that's all.

23:58.352 --> 24:01.082
Next time, make sure your client
really committed a crime.

24:01.288 --> 24:04.451
- Whole lot easier getting him off.
- All right, what's it gonna be?

24:04.625 --> 24:07.185
- Well, I haven't got any dough.
- This way.

24:07.361 --> 24:10.489
- Say, do you give any credit around here?
- Sure we do.

24:10.664 --> 24:13.428
You get 60 days to pay.
This way. Come on.

24:14.435 --> 24:15.834
Well...

24:18.005 --> 24:20.235
So long, Eddie.
I'll see you in September.

24:31.819 --> 24:33.844
- Shut up!
- That won't help.

24:34.121 --> 24:35.315
I tried it.

24:35.489 --> 24:37.514
This ain't no jail, it's a madhouse.

24:38.159 --> 24:40.127
- Have you been a soldier?
- Yeah.

24:40.294 --> 24:41.921
- How do you know?
- I been one too.

24:42.096 --> 24:44.428
We all got the stamp on us.
We can't sit still.

24:44.598 --> 24:46.862
We've seen too much action,
too much blood.

24:47.034 --> 24:50.435
They think after that we can
just sit and twiddle our thumbs. We can't.

24:50.871 --> 24:53.840
- What are you in for?
- Stickup with a gun.

24:54.241 --> 24:55.674
Things got too tough.

24:56.143 --> 24:58.577
If they'd just give me
back that gun, I'd use it...

24:58.746 --> 24:59.940
...on myself.

25:00.114 --> 25:02.844
Come on, grab yourself some sense.
Don't talk that way.

25:03.017 --> 25:04.314
- Hey, Bartlett.
- Yeah?

25:04.485 --> 25:05.850
Step out.

25:06.687 --> 25:09.815
- Your friend here paid your fine.
- Danny boy, glad to see you.

25:09.990 --> 25:11.548
- Glad to see you.
- So long, buddy.

25:11.725 --> 25:13.693
And get rid of those silly notions.

25:13.861 --> 25:15.089
So long.

25:17.498 --> 25:20.831
It's good to get out of that rathole.
Haven't slept in three nights.

25:21.001 --> 25:22.730
- Where'd you get the dough?
- I didn't.

25:22.903 --> 25:24.200
Hello, buster.

25:24.572 --> 25:26.005
Just the gal I wanted to see.

25:26.173 --> 25:29.665
Got a few things I want to say to you.
Of all the double-crossing-

25:29.844 --> 25:31.675
- She paid the fine.
- I didn't walk out.

25:31.846 --> 25:33.473
I just had to rustle up the dough.

25:33.647 --> 25:36.480
You'll get it back, if I have to
give it in nickels and dimes.

25:36.650 --> 25:37.810
I can wait.

25:37.985 --> 25:39.418
What's your angle, sister?

25:39.954 --> 25:42.514
What bank do you want me to rob?
Who do you want killed?

25:42.690 --> 25:43.987
Which do you want first?

25:44.158 --> 25:45.785
First, let's have a drink.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.393
Hop in the cab. I'll drive you.

25:47.561 --> 25:49.995
- Taxi.
- Just a minute. Business before pleasure.

25:50.164 --> 25:52.325
- See you later, Eddie.
- Get that room rent.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.161
- Where to, mister?
- Any Turkish bath.

25:54.335 --> 25:55.563
Right. Get in there.

26:06.213 --> 26:07.703
Going to do a little painting?

26:07.882 --> 26:10.009
Yeah, sort of. A little interior decoration.

26:10.184 --> 26:11.913
- How are you, Panama?
- Hello, Charlie.

26:12.086 --> 26:14.384
- This is Eddie Bartlett.
- How are you?

26:23.864 --> 26:25.764
- What'll it be, Panama?
- Gin Buck.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.831
What's yours?

26:28.869 --> 26:30.530
Glass of milk.

26:34.041 --> 26:36.407
You always order milk
when you go to a speakeasy?

26:37.077 --> 26:38.374
I don't go into speakeasies.

26:38.546 --> 26:40.514
Well, some people like spinach.

26:40.681 --> 26:43.650
Say, you've got something
on your mind. What's the gag?

26:44.051 --> 26:45.245
There's no gag.

26:45.419 --> 26:47.353
I think you're a pretty decent guy.

26:47.521 --> 26:49.011
I like to talk to decent guys.

26:49.623 --> 26:50.851
They're hard to find.

26:52.026 --> 26:53.357
All right, let's talk.

26:55.062 --> 26:58.031
- Things have been tough, haven't they?
- They could be tougher.

26:58.198 --> 27:00.792
A guy in the cell with me
wanted to bump himself off.

27:00.968 --> 27:03.232
Till I get around to that,
I'm doing all right.

27:03.837 --> 27:05.600
Milk. That's all I got.

27:07.341 --> 27:09.070
Here we go again.

27:09.476 --> 27:11.603
I hope he thinks to sample
what's in my glass.

27:11.779 --> 27:14.179
Hey, who owns the car
with the Vermont license on it?

27:14.348 --> 27:15.576
I do.

27:18.752 --> 27:22.586
Don't you know you're breaking the law
parking your car in front of a fire hydrant?

27:22.756 --> 27:25.020
Where do you think you are,
in a little hick town?

27:25.225 --> 27:28.194
If you weren't from out of town,
I'd give you a ticket.

27:28.429 --> 27:32.229
- Get out there and move it.
- Sorry, officer. I'll move it right away.

27:34.635 --> 27:36.398
Hey, Joe.

27:36.704 --> 27:38.399
Come on, let's sit down.

27:38.572 --> 27:41.336
See, buster, it's easy.
All you gotta do is pay off.

27:41.508 --> 27:43.271
- With what?
- Sucker money.

27:43.444 --> 27:47.346
Ever since Prohibition, it's been floating
around, waiting to get picked up.

27:47.514 --> 27:50.381
- Now, a bright guy like you-
- Look, will you stop conning me?

27:50.551 --> 27:52.644
Tell me what goes on. Right now.

27:53.187 --> 27:57.487
You've been nice. You took a rap I couldn't
afford. It would've put me out of business.

27:57.825 --> 28:01.784
I'd hate to see someone like you
banging his head against a stone wall.

28:01.962 --> 28:05.864
The liquor business is gonna grow big,
and it's gonna grow fast.

28:06.133 --> 28:09.296
So get in line, buster.
Hack drivers are a dime a dozen.

28:09.970 --> 28:12.461
- But you gotta know people.
- I know people.

28:12.640 --> 28:16.167
- It takes money.
- I can get it, if you start small.

28:17.544 --> 28:18.772
Tell me.

28:19.079 --> 28:21.445
What's in this for you?
What's your take?

28:22.349 --> 28:23.577
Nothing.

28:24.451 --> 28:26.851
That story about the guy
in the cell was a sad one.

28:27.988 --> 28:30.616
I'd hate to have somebody
tell me that about you.

28:30.791 --> 28:32.019
Why?

28:34.561 --> 28:37.029
I once knew a soldier like you
who went to France.

28:37.765 --> 28:39.164
He never came back.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.630
I never got over it.

28:41.802 --> 28:43.030
That's why.

28:43.537 --> 28:45.198
Is that all of it?

28:46.073 --> 28:49.236
If you don't like that story,
I'll try to think of another one.

28:50.277 --> 28:52.074
It'll do for now.

28:52.246 --> 28:55.443
And so the Eddie of this story
joins the thousands and thousands...

28:55.616 --> 28:57.481
...of other Eddies throughout America.

28:58.085 --> 29:02.112
He becomes a part of a criminal army,
an army that was born of a marriage...

29:02.289 --> 29:05.156
...between an unpopular law
and an unwilling public.

29:05.325 --> 29:07.293
Liquor is the password in this army.

29:07.494 --> 29:12.659
And it's a magic password that spells the
dollar sign as it spreads from city to city...

29:12.833 --> 29:14.357
...from state to state.

29:14.935 --> 29:18.837
The public is beginning to look upon the
bootlegger as an adventuresome hero...

29:19.339 --> 29:23.469
...a modern crusader who deals
in bottles instead of battles.

29:23.644 --> 29:26.204
And so, because
of the grotesque situation...

29:26.547 --> 29:29.175
...this new kind of army grows and grows...

29:29.516 --> 29:33.213
...always gaining new recruits
who care nothing about tomorrow...

29:33.387 --> 29:35.947
...just so long as money is easy today.

29:48.068 --> 29:49.763
I'll take two dozen of those.

29:51.772 --> 29:54.172
- Got a little bad news for you, Eddie.
- Yeah? What?

29:54.341 --> 29:57.037
Little price hike.
It's up a dollar a bottle from here in.

29:57.478 --> 29:59.446
Oh, you don't say. No kidding.

30:00.114 --> 30:02.514
Well, you're not gonna make
a sucker out of me.

30:02.683 --> 30:06.244
I can make this tiger-sweat myself.
I've got a bathtub too.

30:06.687 --> 30:07.915
Come on, Danny.

30:11.058 --> 30:12.355
So long, fellas.

30:47.461 --> 30:49.486
This is the real stuff.
They can't fool me.

30:49.963 --> 30:51.396
1922.

30:51.632 --> 30:55.762
By now, the Prohibition law
is firmly a part of American life...

30:56.036 --> 30:58.266
...but so is the evasion of that law.

30:58.605 --> 31:00.630
College students, male and female...

31:00.808 --> 31:04.107
...and even high-school boys and girls
who never drank before...

31:04.378 --> 31:08.371
...find themselves willing and able to buy
hard liquor with the greatest of ease.

31:08.949 --> 31:12.510
The hip flask becomes an integral part
of the national scene...

31:12.686 --> 31:16.213
...at football games, in automobiles.

31:18.992 --> 31:21.620
In the meanwhile,
the supply of good alcohol...

31:21.795 --> 31:24.889
...fails to keep up with
the ever-increasing demand for liquor.

31:25.065 --> 31:28.728
But in the undercover liquor industry,
crude stills make their appearance.

31:29.169 --> 31:33.697
Wood alcohol is recooked, and the product
of this loose and ineffective process...

31:34.007 --> 31:36.942
...is put on the market in
a constantly swelling flood.

31:46.520 --> 31:47.851
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi, Danny boy.

31:48.021 --> 31:49.147
Hi, Lloyd.

31:49.323 --> 31:50.950
Holy smoke, Eddie, another one?

31:51.258 --> 31:54.284
Yeah, sure. We'll get more as
fast as Lloyd can pick them up.

31:54.494 --> 31:58.225
Soon we'll have so many cabs,
we'll have to pick up passengers again.

31:58.398 --> 32:00.161
That might not be a bad idea.

32:06.473 --> 32:09.306
- Which one is Bartlett?
- Me. Why?

32:09.476 --> 32:11.341
Hally told us to come here and see you.

32:11.979 --> 32:13.947
Oh, yeah. When did you get out?

32:14.214 --> 32:15.408
Yesterday.

32:15.582 --> 32:17.140
- What were you up for?
- Stickup.

32:18.051 --> 32:20.019
- You drive?
- Why not?

32:21.221 --> 32:23.246
- What about you?
- I worked in a bank.

32:24.124 --> 32:25.352
Oh, I see.

32:25.759 --> 32:27.158
Took a few samples, huh?

32:27.461 --> 32:28.689
Sort of.

32:29.897 --> 32:31.558
Can use you in the office.

32:32.132 --> 32:34.532
- What was your rap?
- They didn't have a thing on me.

32:34.701 --> 32:35.793
I was framed.

32:38.572 --> 32:39.834
Sorry. Can't use you.

32:40.007 --> 32:41.474
- Say, now-
- Beat it.

32:45.012 --> 32:48.812
Look, I don't care what you did before,
or if you've got a record a mile long.

32:49.182 --> 32:52.811
But remember this. When you're working
for me, you keep your nose clean.

32:53.420 --> 32:54.751
- You hear?
- Sure.

32:54.955 --> 32:56.923
All right.
This is Danny Green.

32:57.090 --> 33:00.025
- Danny, show them the layout.
- Glad to meet you, fellas.

33:00.193 --> 33:03.526
- Some of my best friends are in jail.
- All right, Danny. All right.

33:03.697 --> 33:05.187
Lloyd, let's go in the office.

33:05.365 --> 33:08.095
Do you have a prejudice against
hiring honest citizens?

33:08.435 --> 33:11.563
In this booze business,
you can't hire any geraniums.

33:11.872 --> 33:15.808
A couple of years in the stir
seems to ripen them for the job. Come on.

33:16.843 --> 33:19.073
I tell you, he's on his way
over there right now.

33:19.246 --> 33:20.577
Hello. Two cases, yeah.

33:20.747 --> 33:22.305
- Send it right up.
- How you doing?

33:22.482 --> 33:26.714
- They lap it up faster than we can deliver.
- That means you gotta deliver it faster.

33:26.887 --> 33:30.948
Here you are, big and good-looking.
Buy yourself a new set of law books.

33:31.325 --> 33:33.793
Wait a minute, Eddie.
This is too much for what I did.

33:33.961 --> 33:36.191
Buying a couple of taxicabs
doesn't rate this.

33:36.363 --> 33:39.992
You saved me dough. Take it.
It's a beginner. Hang on to my shirttails...

33:40.167 --> 33:42.965
- ... you'll be using that for wallpaper.
- Listen, Eddie...

33:43.136 --> 33:46.128
...you should use those cabs as cabs.
You're on the wrong track.

33:46.306 --> 33:47.603
This dough says I'm not.

33:47.774 --> 33:51.642
While the gravy's flowing, I'm gonna be
there with my kisser under the faucet.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.177
This isn't my kind of law.

33:53.347 --> 33:55.645
I started out to be a corporation lawyer.

33:55.816 --> 33:58.444
- This is a corporation. It's making money.
- Yeah.

33:58.618 --> 34:00.609
Eddie, for you.

34:02.990 --> 34:04.821
Yeah? Yeah?

34:05.225 --> 34:09.217
Oh, no. No, no. Sorry.
No, can't use it.

34:09.396 --> 34:12.922
Don't be a sap. You want to chase
ambulances for the next 10 years?

34:13.100 --> 34:16.934
Take what you can get while you can get it.
Nobody's gonna drop it in your lap.

34:17.103 --> 34:18.833
Chuck, here's a grand from Moore.

34:19.005 --> 34:20.405
- How'd you make out?
- Okay.

34:20.574 --> 34:24.806
- Did you get that dough from Masters?
- Can't collect from a guy you can't catch.

34:24.978 --> 34:28.675
Anybody who can put on a $100,000
musical comedy can afford to pay me.

34:28.849 --> 34:30.077
I'll get it.

34:31.618 --> 34:32.744
I'll see you later.

34:32.918 --> 34:37.686
Don't think everything's all wrong because
you're not starving to death, you hear?

34:37.858 --> 34:40.554
Yeah? Sure. Sure, it's good stuff.

34:40.726 --> 34:44.891
- We just got it off the boat.
- This is bonded stuff, 12 years old.

34:59.079 --> 35:00.979
- Masters here?
- Who wants to see him?

35:01.148 --> 35:03.309
- Me.
- Just a minute. You can't go in there.

35:03.483 --> 35:07.749
Take it easy. Take it easy. It's a hot night.
Here. Buy yourself a couple of suds.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.357
- Hello, Masters.
- Hello.

35:11.525 --> 35:14.358
You've seen this before.
How about paying attention to me?

35:14.528 --> 35:17.053
Eddie, I don't need any liquor
right now. I got plenty.

35:17.230 --> 35:19.698
I know, you haven't paid for it.
Seven hundred bucks.

35:19.866 --> 35:21.493
I'm not taking any runaround.

35:21.668 --> 35:24.831
You know I'm always good for it.
I'll send you a check tomorrow.

35:25.005 --> 35:27.974
Oh, no. I'll take the cash right now.

35:28.141 --> 35:30.609
Well, wait till this number's over.

35:42.522 --> 35:45.923
That's a pretty cute bundle you got
on the end of the line there.

35:46.626 --> 35:49.026
Maybe I could wrap it up for you.

35:50.430 --> 35:52.830
I think I can wrap that up myself.

36:10.417 --> 36:12.180
Hi, Mineola.

36:12.352 --> 36:14.411
Remember me?
Bartlett, your dream soldier?

36:14.588 --> 36:16.647
Oh, yes, I remember.

36:16.823 --> 36:18.450
- You haven't changed.
- You have.

36:18.625 --> 36:20.217
Three years make a big difference.

36:20.393 --> 36:23.260
- My character has changed, hasn't it?
- It's filled out.

36:23.430 --> 36:24.727
I have to change.

36:24.898 --> 36:26.490
Will I see you after the show?

36:26.666 --> 36:29.191
- I have an engagement.
- How about tomorrow night?

36:29.369 --> 36:31.303
- I'm busy.
- Then Thursday or Friday.

36:31.471 --> 36:33.132
- I'm busy then too.
- Busy all week?

36:33.306 --> 36:36.707
- Yes.
- Do you mind if I drive by and blow my horn?

36:36.877 --> 36:39.937
You do that, I won't hear it.
Good night, Mr. Bartlett.

36:47.320 --> 36:50.847
Masters, I'll be back tomorrow night
to pick up that check.

37:03.370 --> 37:05.895
I'll bet you thought I'd never show up.

37:06.072 --> 37:08.336
I'm sorry. My date'll meet me on the corner.

37:08.508 --> 37:12.376
I'll walk down there with you. Lot of fresh
guys out. Something might happen to you.

37:12.546 --> 37:15.447
Oh, really, I'm catching
a 12:00 train to Mineola.

37:15.615 --> 37:19.381
I know you're big now, but don't forget,
I knew you when you danced for the Elks.

37:19.553 --> 37:21.817
I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just let me prove it.

37:21.988 --> 37:24.718
In fact... I might even
help you with your algebra.

37:25.425 --> 37:26.949
That's what I wanna see.

37:27.127 --> 37:31.530
Look, I still have to catch that 12:00 train
because the next one isn't until 3:30.

37:31.698 --> 37:34.599
Mind if I walk down to the station,
sort of wave goodbye?

37:34.768 --> 37:36.030
I can do that, can't I?

37:59.526 --> 38:01.994
Sing that again.
I'm a sucker for that. Go ahead.

38:02.162 --> 38:04.494
- I'm liable to wake him up.
- Who, him?

38:04.664 --> 38:08.156
If he's been drinking the kind of booze
I make, it'll take more than a song.

38:08.368 --> 38:09.960
Come on, sing it again.

38:10.503 --> 38:12.733
Not now, it's too sad.
And I feel too good.

38:12.906 --> 38:15.773
- Did you enjoy yourself?
- Oh, I've never had a better time.

38:15.942 --> 38:19.469
You know, tonight was the first time
I've ever been in a speakeasy.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.371
What're you doing, singing in baby shoes?

38:22.549 --> 38:23.777
What?

38:23.950 --> 38:26.180
No, no. Never mind.
I was just talking to myself.

38:26.353 --> 38:28.685
A habit I picked up in France
during the war.

38:28.855 --> 38:32.291
I suppose you like to spend
your spare time baking a cake...

38:32.459 --> 38:35.121
...or fooling around in the garden
or sewing a dress.

38:35.295 --> 38:38.059
Did you make that hat?
It's very pretty. Very pretty.

38:38.231 --> 38:40.927
I wish I did have time to do
all those things. But I don't.

38:41.101 --> 38:42.625
I spend my spare time studying.

38:42.802 --> 38:46.329
- Someday I'll be a musical-comedy star.
- Oh, I see. I see.

38:46.506 --> 38:49.441
And you're dancing in the chorus
to get money for lessons.

38:49.609 --> 38:52.737
You'd rather not, but a girl has to
live somehow, doesn't she?

38:52.912 --> 38:54.880
You sound as if you don't believe me.

38:55.048 --> 38:57.573
I do, I certainly do.
Why wouldn't I?

38:57.751 --> 39:00.117
Mineola. Mineola.

39:00.287 --> 39:02.118
I'm so tired I can hardly get up.

39:02.289 --> 39:05.281
I suppose you're very sleepy
and wanna go right to bed...

39:05.458 --> 39:07.722
...because you've got
a lesson in the morning.

39:07.894 --> 39:10.192
- That's right, I do.
- I see.

39:17.537 --> 39:18.936
Well, here we are.

39:19.105 --> 39:20.333
Yeah.

39:22.442 --> 39:24.307
Here we are.

39:29.716 --> 39:32.276
You're kind of old
to play with dolls, aren't you?

39:32.452 --> 39:34.818
No, not too old if they're cute.

39:34.988 --> 39:37.286
Well, good night.
I've had a wonderful time.

39:37.457 --> 39:40.483
- Hey, it's kind of a quick brushoff, ain't it?
- What do you mean?

39:40.660 --> 39:43.595
It's a long trip to Mineola,
and I like to relax between trains.

39:43.763 --> 39:45.856
It's 4:00 in the morning.

39:46.032 --> 39:48.330
You certainly have learned
all the answers.

39:48.501 --> 39:50.560
Well, you seem to know all the questions.

39:50.737 --> 39:54.468
Well, if you really want to stay,
we could sit here on the porch for a while.

39:54.641 --> 39:57.940
The night air doesn't agree with me.
I take cold kind of easy.

39:58.111 --> 40:00.443
I'm strictly an indoor man myself.

40:00.814 --> 40:03.977
- Well, all right, we can go in, then.
- That's a whole lot better.

40:05.118 --> 40:07.814
We got to be careful
not to disturb your mother.

40:08.855 --> 40:10.345
What's the matter?

40:10.523 --> 40:14.425
Of course, you had no way of knowing,
but Mother passed away over a year ago.

40:14.594 --> 40:16.858
Oh, I'm sorry, kid.

40:18.398 --> 40:19.990
You live here all by yourself?

40:20.166 --> 40:22.896
Well, I have to until I can
sell the house or get a break.

40:23.069 --> 40:24.468
You mean get a break singing?

40:26.806 --> 40:29.206
- How long you been with the show?
- Three weeks.

40:29.376 --> 40:31.105
It's closing the end of next week.

40:31.277 --> 40:34.576
- Then what?
- Then I'll just have to look for another job.

40:34.981 --> 40:37.677
- Won't you come in?
- Oh, no, thanks. No.

40:37.851 --> 40:40.411
As you said, it is getting late.
And I'll call you.

40:40.587 --> 40:42.953
- In another three years?
- No, no.

40:43.123 --> 40:44.920
Most likely another three hours.

40:46.426 --> 40:48.860
- You want this, don't you?
- Oh, yes. Thanks.

40:49.028 --> 40:51.121
I think I'm gonna like this doll.

40:51.297 --> 40:52.821
I know I am.

40:52.999 --> 40:55.797
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:05.545 --> 41:07.410
Well, when did you two sneak in?

41:07.580 --> 41:08.842
What are you doing here?

41:09.015 --> 41:13.816
Rachmaninoff and I are going to audition
a dream, one of the better kind.

41:16.289 --> 41:18.484
Now, there's not a thing
to worry about, kid.

41:18.658 --> 41:21.092
You just wait right here.

41:21.261 --> 41:23.525
Hi, Panama. Hi, Henderson.

41:23.696 --> 41:26.324
Okay, buster, what are you selling,
and what's her name?

41:26.499 --> 41:29.764
I've got a gal here with class,
which is something this joint needs.

41:29.936 --> 41:31.460
Disregard the guy's insinuations.

41:31.638 --> 41:34.664
No kidding, lot of stuff on the ball.
Sounds just like Nora Bayes.

41:34.841 --> 41:37.071
All right, Ziegfeld,
let's see the prize package.

41:37.243 --> 41:38.972
Jean.

41:43.016 --> 41:44.813
This is Panama Smith.

41:44.984 --> 41:47.680
And the man here with
the worried look is Pete Henderson.

41:47.854 --> 41:49.287
Jean Sherman.

41:49.522 --> 41:52.889
- I hope Eddie hasn't built me up too much.
- So do I.

41:53.092 --> 41:54.855
All right, Jean. Come on, honey.

41:55.028 --> 41:57.588
Show them how a song should be sung.

42:02.669 --> 42:04.364
What are you gonna sing?

42:04.537 --> 42:08.701
What key do you want it in?
And how do you want it played?

42:08.875 --> 42:11.469
"Melancholy Baby" in the key of G.

42:11.644 --> 42:14.204
- And not too fast, please.
- Gotcha.

42:14.380 --> 42:17.281
You're among friends, now.
Don't tighten up.

42:19.018 --> 42:22.784
Sit down, Eddie.
Let's get a chump's-eye view of her.

43:35.929 --> 43:37.556
- Thanks.
- Nice going, kid.

43:37.730 --> 43:41.359
You really did it, baby. You really did it.
Sounded like a trio.

43:41.834 --> 43:45.031
Thanks for listening, Miss Smith,
and you too, Mr. Henderson.

43:45.204 --> 43:46.671
You wait outside for me, honey.

43:46.839 --> 43:48.773
I'll handle this for you.

43:49.275 --> 43:51.835
- Well, great, wasn't she?
- I've heard worse.

43:52.011 --> 43:55.503
- I don't know one note from another.
- You heard all the good ones that time.

43:55.682 --> 43:59.482
- Eddie, I ain't got room for any more singers.
- You're wrong. You'll make room.

43:59.652 --> 44:01.620
When does she start?

44:01.788 --> 44:03.722
Well, I can only pay her 35 bucks a week.

44:03.890 --> 44:07.519
- Wrong again. You'll pay her 100.
- A hundred? Say, I don't pay myself 100.

44:07.694 --> 44:11.152
You can't sing. Don't worry,
Petty Larceny, I'll make up the difference.

44:11.331 --> 44:14.789
- Only she's not supposed to know.
- I don't care, as long as I don't pay it.

44:14.968 --> 44:17.630
Now you can stop crying.
When do you want her to begin?

44:17.804 --> 44:19.897
Let's say a week from tonight, Galahad.

44:20.073 --> 44:21.768
Maybe you'll be over it by then.

44:21.941 --> 44:23.340
I doubt it.

44:23.509 --> 44:25.943
Well, I'll see you around.

44:26.546 --> 44:29.481
Especially next week. So long, presh.

44:30.149 --> 44:33.585
She seems like a nice kid.
I hope she can outtalk him.

44:33.753 --> 44:36.153
I hope she can outrun him.

44:36.723 --> 44:39.817
Sure. Eddie imports all of his wines.

44:40.026 --> 44:41.789
I'll send it right over.

44:41.961 --> 44:43.053
Hello.

44:43.229 --> 44:45.220
- It's on its way.
- Hi, big and good-looking.

44:45.398 --> 44:47.798
- Hello, Eddie.
- This is Lloyd Hart, our legal brain.

44:47.967 --> 44:50.527
If you want to sue anybody, see him.

44:50.703 --> 44:52.102
- Jean Sherman.
- How do you do?

44:52.538 --> 44:53.630
Hello.

44:53.806 --> 44:57.537
Oh, Eddie, I can pick up five more cabs
for you, but it'll take straight cash.

44:57.710 --> 44:59.803
What do we use? Cigar-store coupons?
Get them.

44:59.979 --> 45:03.437
This is where we take orders for the booze.
I'll show you where we make it.

45:03.616 --> 45:05.607
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

45:06.986 --> 45:08.817
This is a still.

45:08.988 --> 45:12.754
Some of the alcohol we get around here
is not so good, so we recook it.

45:12.925 --> 45:14.654
Jiggers here is making Scotch.

45:14.827 --> 45:17.887
A little alcohol, a little water,
a little color, a little flavor.

45:18.064 --> 45:21.522
Tonight we deliver it at six bucks
a quart. Costs half a buck.

45:22.635 --> 45:23.966
Louie here's an artist.

45:24.137 --> 45:27.038
He gives it that saltwater smell.
You know, right off the boat?

45:27.206 --> 45:29.071
- Smell it up good, Louie.
- Right.

45:29.242 --> 45:31.335
- Hi, Danny.
- Hello, Eddie.

45:31.511 --> 45:33.240
- Hello, Mineola.
- Hello.

45:33.413 --> 45:35.506
- Where's your manners?
- Hello, Miss Mineola.

45:35.682 --> 45:37.377
No. The dicer. The skimmer.

45:37.550 --> 45:39.245
Excuse me.

45:39.419 --> 45:40.886
Hello.

45:41.054 --> 45:44.387
This is the deluxe department.
The boy here is making champagne.

45:44.557 --> 45:48.186
Tonight, it will be delivered
at the best circles. Fifteen bucks a quart.

45:48.361 --> 45:51.694
- Is it real champagne?
- No, it's diluted New Jersey applejack.

45:51.864 --> 45:55.493
The chumps will think it's vintage stuff
off the boat, bottled in France.

45:55.668 --> 45:57.363
It's kind of cheating, isn't it?

45:57.537 --> 46:00.995
Cheating? Yes, if you get caught.
But you don't get caught if you...

46:01.174 --> 46:04.974
...take care of the right people.
And this is big business. Very big business.

46:14.987 --> 46:16.921
Hello, Eddie.
How about a drink?

46:17.090 --> 46:18.489
Not during office hours.

46:19.092 --> 46:20.457
How are you?

46:20.626 --> 46:23.993
- Hello, Ed. How are you?
- Hello, Eddie.

46:26.766 --> 46:29.326
- What's the-? Hi.
- When you're told to do something...

46:29.502 --> 46:33.233
...why don't you do it? Instead of sitting
around drinking rotgut you're to sell.

46:33.406 --> 46:36.603
I did it, Eddie. I got the joint jammed
with professional applauders.

46:36.776 --> 46:38.266
Two bucks a head and drinks.

46:38.444 --> 46:41.140
One of the guys even brought
a dishpan to pound on.

46:41.314 --> 46:44.010
Throw him out.
We need to keep this thing smart.

46:44.183 --> 46:47.619
Tell these monkeys if they sit
on their hands, I'll chop them off.

46:47.787 --> 46:49.277
You hear? Now, go on, get moving.

46:49.455 --> 46:52.856
For the last time, I'm telling you,
ginger ale is cheaper than liquor.

46:53.025 --> 46:54.253
Mix them accordingly.

46:54.427 --> 46:58.227
Is this kid a draw or isn't she? You haven't
had such a crowd since you opened.

46:58.397 --> 47:01.230
Why shouldn't it be full?
Most of them are here on rain checks.

47:01.400 --> 47:02.662
Getting paid, ain't you?

47:02.835 --> 47:05.804
I don't expect to get
a sucker like you every night.

47:08.107 --> 47:11.565
Don't you ever say that
to me again, do you hear? Never.

47:23.289 --> 47:25.223
- You having a good time?
- Swell.

47:25.391 --> 47:29.191
Shouldn't have told me that, chump.
That'll be 10 bucks extra on your check.

47:30.530 --> 47:32.430
She's just kidding.

47:33.132 --> 47:35.657
Well, she goes on in a couple of minutes.

47:35.868 --> 47:37.028
Oh, yeah.

47:37.203 --> 47:39.501
- What's eating you, Eddie?
- Nothing. Why?

47:39.672 --> 47:41.469
I've never seen you like this before.

47:41.641 --> 47:44.838
You act like a kid who's going to
try on his first pair of long pants.

47:45.244 --> 47:48.771
Panama, I'll let you in on something.

47:49.115 --> 47:51.208
Here. Throw a lamp on that.

47:52.952 --> 47:55.011
What a load of ice.

47:55.588 --> 47:57.146
So, what's this kid got on you?

47:57.723 --> 48:01.250
I don't know. Whatever it takes
to get a guy like me, she's got.

48:01.427 --> 48:02.985
She know about this?

48:03.162 --> 48:05.426
No. I'm gonna tell her after the show.

48:05.631 --> 48:07.155
You might be moving too fast.

48:07.333 --> 48:10.894
Sometimes you get over these things,
and you're sorry.

48:11.070 --> 48:14.631
- I don't think I'll ever get over this.
- You're batting out of your league.

48:14.807 --> 48:19.471
You're used to traveling around
with dames like me.

48:20.479 --> 48:21.878
You sure got it bad.

48:22.048 --> 48:23.675
Suppose she turns you down?

48:25.051 --> 48:26.848
Turn me down?

48:27.019 --> 48:28.646
Why should she turn me down?

48:28.988 --> 48:31.013
Suppose you tell me about that later.

48:35.761 --> 48:37.786
Okay, Roy!

48:38.731 --> 48:42.792
All right, now that we got quiet, get your
hands out of your pockets. You'll need them.

48:42.969 --> 48:45.233
Tonight we're gonna do
a Christopher Columbus.

48:45.404 --> 48:49.272
We're bringing you a little gal that's new
to nightclubs and almost everything else.

48:49.442 --> 48:51.967
And she's gonna sing.
And if anybody makes any noise...

48:52.144 --> 48:54.942
...the waiters have been told
to slip them a mickey.

48:55.114 --> 48:59.380
Here she is, folks. Her name is Jean Sherman.
The song is "I'm Wild About Harry. "

48:59.552 --> 49:02.077
And when she finishes,
you'll be wild about Jean.

49:02.255 --> 49:04.280
So come on out, honey.

50:31.177 --> 50:34.271
What's going on here, anyway?

50:34.447 --> 50:36.142
Applaud, you stewbum!

50:36.315 --> 50:37.304
Oh, I see.

50:38.617 --> 50:40.778
Oh, Eddie. It's beautiful.

50:41.320 --> 50:43.550
That ain't what I wanna hear.

50:44.423 --> 50:48.291
- They seemed to like me, didn't they?
- You're stalling me, Jeanie.

50:49.929 --> 50:52.864
- You've been awfully good to me.
- I improve with age.

50:53.032 --> 50:57.492
If you want the Brooklyn Bridge,
just ask for it. If I can't buy it, I'll steal it.

50:57.670 --> 50:59.035
Well?

51:01.307 --> 51:02.831
Eddie, I don't know.

51:03.009 --> 51:04.533
What do you mean, you don't know?

51:04.710 --> 51:06.473
I haven't had time to think about it.

51:06.645 --> 51:09.842
You've had plenty of time.
I didn't have to say how I felt about you.

51:10.016 --> 51:11.677
You must've seen it a million ways.

51:11.851 --> 51:14.513
- I have.
- Well?

51:15.354 --> 51:17.117
I don't know, Eddie. I just don't know.

51:17.289 --> 51:20.816
You ought to know how you feel about me,
whether you like me or not.

51:20.993 --> 51:22.221
I do like you, but...

51:22.395 --> 51:23.987
But what?

51:24.163 --> 51:26.529
I just can't tell you.

51:29.368 --> 51:31.063
I know what's bothering you.

51:31.237 --> 51:33.034
Maybe Panama was right.

51:33.205 --> 51:36.106
Baby, you and me
don't play in the same league.

51:37.276 --> 51:41.372
Yeah, that's it. You don't like the racket
I'm in, the people I know, the things I do.

51:41.547 --> 51:43.845
It's not me, it's what I stand for.
Am I right?

51:44.016 --> 51:47.144
- Why, I-
- Yeah, I am right.

51:47.319 --> 51:49.514
I'm not letting that
stand between you and me.

51:49.688 --> 51:52.248
Not the way I feel about you. I'll get out.

51:52.425 --> 51:56.691
A few more years, I'll have enough dough
so we can settle down and forget all this.

51:57.163 --> 51:58.824
How does that sound to you?

51:59.932 --> 52:02.400
Why, it sounds all right.

52:02.568 --> 52:05.059
Yeah. Well, you hang on to that ring.

52:05.304 --> 52:07.966
You'll use it a whole lot sooner
than you expected.

52:22.455 --> 52:27.188
Get that yard of clothesline out of your kisser
and try to pay some attention for a minute.

52:27.393 --> 52:30.851
Look, Brown, here it is.
The stuff I sell has a very limited market.

52:31.030 --> 52:33.760
People with dough
don't wanna buy the poison I make.

52:33.933 --> 52:36.697
Now, I want to get in
on that good market.

52:38.003 --> 52:39.698
I know you're head of a syndicate...

52:39.872 --> 52:42.898
...that's running the high-class
merchandise sold in this country.

52:43.075 --> 52:46.067
All I want you to do is sell me some.

52:47.880 --> 52:49.745
Well, what do you say?

52:51.117 --> 52:52.982
- No.
- Why not?

52:53.152 --> 52:57.111
I don't sell to penny-ante guys.
I got distribution of my own.

52:58.057 --> 53:01.720
Well, don't forget, this penny-ante guy
asked you in a nice way.

53:01.894 --> 53:04.021
I'll try and remember.

53:24.817 --> 53:28.719
You're supposed to be Coast Guard men.
Try to act it till you get onboard.

53:28.888 --> 53:31.322
When you do get on,
get that booze off fast.

53:31.490 --> 53:33.981
- And don't use your guns.
- Unless it's a tie.

53:34.160 --> 53:35.855
Unless it's a-

53:36.028 --> 53:38.121
Now, remember what you've been told.

53:47.206 --> 53:49.538
Boat coming up two points off port bow.

53:49.708 --> 53:51.801
That must be Nick's boys.

53:58.517 --> 54:00.508
Cut it down to half speed.

54:05.391 --> 54:07.086
Hey, that ain't none of our mob.

54:07.259 --> 54:09.193
Looks like a Coast Guard.

54:12.998 --> 54:14.829
Ahoy, freighter!

54:15.000 --> 54:18.595
You'd better stop. They can't do nothing.
We're more than 12 miles out, right?

54:18.771 --> 54:19.931
We're in the clear.

54:20.105 --> 54:22.039
Get that line over.

54:25.711 --> 54:28.202
Stand by!
We're coming aboard!

54:28.581 --> 54:32.108
You can't touch us!
We're outside the 12-mile limit!

54:32.284 --> 54:34.252
Go home and rescue a swimmer!

54:39.291 --> 54:40.986
Come on, boys, rip into it.

54:41.160 --> 54:43.128
Get those hatches open.

54:44.230 --> 54:46.892
You can't get away with this.
We're on the outside.

54:47.066 --> 54:49.398
I wouldn't care
if we were in the Suez Canal.

54:49.568 --> 54:51.798
Get off of this boat,
or we'll throw you off.

55:11.123 --> 55:13.250
Hey, get them up there!

55:13.425 --> 55:14.653
Come on, get them up!

55:14.994 --> 55:17.554
This guy ain't no fed.

55:17.863 --> 55:19.228
Hey, what outfit is this?

55:19.398 --> 55:20.956
Come on, men, move that stuff.

55:21.133 --> 55:22.361
- Who's taking us?
- I am.

55:22.534 --> 55:24.331
Well, you can't get away-

55:24.503 --> 55:26.471
- Hello, George.
- Eddie.

55:26.639 --> 55:29.767
- Hey, I thought you was running a garage.
- Kept me indoors too much.

55:29.942 --> 55:32.877
- Doc decided I needed a sea trip.
- I got the same doctor.

55:33.045 --> 55:35.479
I don't know why,
but I'm glad to see you.

55:35.648 --> 55:37.115
So am I.

55:37.549 --> 55:41.315
Before you go through with this, we'd
better talk. You're heading for trouble.

55:41.520 --> 55:43.852
This is Nick Brown's boat.

55:44.023 --> 55:47.959
Ernie, keep that stuff moving fast.
We gotta get it all off before daylight.

55:48.127 --> 55:49.526
It's moving.

55:50.863 --> 55:53.127
Let's you and me have a little drink.

55:56.802 --> 55:58.565
- It's real stuff, Danny?
- Maybe not...

55:58.737 --> 56:01.433
...but it'll get into a lot better homes
than we ever will.

56:02.041 --> 56:03.269
What'll you have?

56:03.442 --> 56:05.410
Oh, nothing for me.

56:05.577 --> 56:08.944
You don't have to be afraid of this stuff.
This is the McCoy. I drink it.

56:09.114 --> 56:10.342
I still don't like it.

56:10.516 --> 56:14.145
You like it enough to knock over this boat
for $100,000 worth of it.

56:14.320 --> 56:16.948
A dress salesman doesn't have to
wear dresses, does he?

56:17.189 --> 56:18.747
Sorry I have to clip you, George.

56:18.924 --> 56:22.690
You ain't clipping me, you're clipping
Nick Brown, the guy I work for.

56:22.861 --> 56:24.658
He's gonna be awful sore at you, Eddie.

56:24.830 --> 56:27.298
I'm in too much of a hurry
to worry about that.

56:27.466 --> 56:30.560
- He's a mean guy.
- I'll take my chances.

56:33.005 --> 56:34.472
You know...

56:35.074 --> 56:37.201
...I think I'd like to take mine with you.

56:37.376 --> 56:39.503
Between us, we ought to do
all right together.

56:39.678 --> 56:41.009
I'm doing all right now.

56:41.180 --> 56:43.705
Look here, Eddie.
It won't be so easy the next time.

56:43.882 --> 56:47.818
Brown ain't gonna stand for you hijacking
his boat. Next time he'll be ready for you.

56:47.986 --> 56:52.047
One fine night, a 5-inch shell
is gonna blow the top of your head off.

56:52.558 --> 56:55.391
You can't spend your profits
in the bottom of the ocean.

56:55.561 --> 56:58.655
- Go on.
- Well, it's like this.

56:59.665 --> 57:03.260
I got the organization to bring the stuff in,
and I know where to get it.

57:03.435 --> 57:05.995
You've got the organization to peddle it.

57:09.007 --> 57:11.202
You mean you want to double-cross Brown.

57:11.510 --> 57:13.137
It's been done before, you know.

57:17.716 --> 57:19.411
What do you say?

57:21.453 --> 57:23.683
I don't trust you, George.

57:24.923 --> 57:27.653
You could stand
a little watching yourself.

57:28.727 --> 57:31.753
That sounds like
a pretty good basis for a partnership.

57:32.131 --> 57:33.598
You're on, it's a deal.

57:33.766 --> 57:35.063
Right.

57:39.919 --> 57:45.619
1924. By now, America is well launched
into an era of amazing madness.

57:45.792 --> 57:48.761
Bootlegging has grown from small,
individual effort...

57:48.962 --> 57:52.955
...to big business, embodying
huge coalitions and combines.

57:53.133 --> 57:57.365
The chase after huge profits is followed
closely by their inevitable partners...

57:57.537 --> 58:00.097
...corruption, violence and murder.

58:00.273 --> 58:03.401
A new and powerful tool
appears, the Tommy...

58:03.576 --> 58:06.170
...a light, deadly, wasp-like machine gun...

58:06.346 --> 58:10.146
...and murder henceforth is parceled out
in wholesale lots.

58:57.330 --> 58:58.820
What's the matter? Are you nuts?

58:58.998 --> 59:01.193
You want the other guard, don't you?

59:18.184 --> 59:20.209
You got those keys?
Open up for Danny.

59:20.386 --> 59:22.217
Take good care of those guys.

01:00:19.445 --> 01:00:22.437
All right, boys. Come on.
Get moving, and fast.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.883
- Uncle Sam working for us.
- The government takes it from Nick Brown.

01:00:31.057 --> 01:00:33.048
We take it from the government.
Pretty neat.

01:00:33.226 --> 01:00:37.560
Danny, you go outside and watch.
There may be some trouble around.

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:39.630
- I don't want you here.
- I ain't afraid.

01:00:39.799 --> 01:00:41.699
I don't care.
You're not cut out for this.

01:00:41.868 --> 01:00:44.063
Now, go on, do as you're told. Get outside.

01:00:59.085 --> 01:01:03.249
- I'd say there's about 4000 cases.
- Eddie, the relief watchman just came up.

01:01:04.023 --> 01:01:07.117
Now, look. Get those trucks moving
and stay with them.

01:01:07.293 --> 01:01:08.590
All right, boys, wash it up.

01:01:08.761 --> 01:01:10.422
Get in the trucks.
Get ready to move.

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:05.983
Well...

01:02:06.152 --> 01:02:08.484
...if it ain't my old sergeant.

01:02:08.755 --> 01:02:10.916
Come on, chop him again.
Let's get out of here.

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:12.990
It's Sergeant Leather Lungs, our old pal.

01:02:13.159 --> 01:02:17.528
I told you we'd meet sometime when you had
no stripes on your sleeve, and here we are.

01:02:22.335 --> 01:02:25.566
- You didn't have to do that.
- He had it coming to him.

01:02:28.074 --> 01:02:29.939
Get in back with the boys.

01:02:30.143 --> 01:02:32.976
Someday that heater of yours
will blast you into the hot seat.

01:02:33.146 --> 01:02:35.808
Well, if it does, you'll be sitting
right in my lap.

01:04:06.606 --> 01:04:08.471
Nice, isn't she?

01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:10.609
She sings well.

01:04:11.144 --> 01:04:13.339
See quite a lot of her lately, don't you?

01:04:13.513 --> 01:04:16.038
I can't help seeing her.
I have to be here quite a bit.

01:04:16.215 --> 01:04:18.206
It's all right. You don't have to get sore.

01:04:18.384 --> 01:04:19.942
Why shouldn't you see her?

01:04:20.119 --> 01:04:21.984
She's your kind of kid.

01:04:22.188 --> 01:04:26.488
You both like the same things,
talk the same language.

01:04:26.859 --> 01:04:29.020
Just like me and Eddie.

01:05:06.866 --> 01:05:09.198
All right, chumps.
You've had your entertainment.

01:05:09.368 --> 01:05:11.893
Now you can dance.
Because when you dance, you get hot.

01:05:12.071 --> 01:05:15.097
When you get hot, you get thirsty,
and that's the way we want you.

01:05:15.274 --> 01:05:18.334
So come on! Dance and drink, folks.
Come on, dance and drink.

01:05:22.615 --> 01:05:24.139
- Packing them in, huh?
- Oh, so-so.

01:05:24.317 --> 01:05:27.081
He can't be happy.
He ain't got no tables on the ceiling.

01:05:27.253 --> 01:05:29.118
Too bad, because
we got new stuff for you.

01:05:29.288 --> 01:05:32.416
- Cut a pint into two quarts.
- We're sending you 100 cases.

01:05:32.592 --> 01:05:34.822
- I don't need 100 cases.
- You'll take them.

01:05:34.994 --> 01:05:37.724
You don't want
to hurt our feelings, do you?

01:05:40.633 --> 01:05:43.864
Can you imagine that guy,
saying business is just so-and-so?

01:05:44.036 --> 01:05:46.527
That guy'd beef if he won a sweepstake.

01:05:46.706 --> 01:05:48.037
- Hello, kiddies.
- Hello, boys.

01:05:48.207 --> 01:05:49.572
- Hi, Panama.
- Hello, George.

01:05:49.742 --> 01:05:50.800
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi.

01:05:50.977 --> 01:05:53.138
Eddie, I've been trying
to locate you for hours.

01:05:53.312 --> 01:05:56.076
There's several important matters
we should discuss tonight.

01:05:56.249 --> 01:05:57.307
They can wait.

01:05:57.517 --> 01:06:01.578
Wouldn't be a bad idea to pay more attention
to our business instead of them cabs.

01:06:01.754 --> 01:06:03.745
We're doing okay.
What are you beefing about?

01:06:03.923 --> 01:06:07.415
I wanna buy 10,000 cabs, I'll buy them.
Besides, they're a good front.

01:06:07.593 --> 01:06:09.857
Maybe something to fall back on
in my old age.

01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:12.554
In this business
you shouldn't worry about old age.

01:06:12.732 --> 01:06:13.960
- More cabs, huh?
- Yeah.

01:06:14.133 --> 01:06:16.795
- Yeah, that brings it up to 2000.
- Piker.

01:06:16.969 --> 01:06:20.871
- Excuse me. I'll see if I can grab a dance.
- That'll be a break for some dame.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.941
- Mr. Hart, you're wanted on the telephone.
- Thank you.

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:25.577
- Excuse me.
- Stick around, Lloyd.

01:06:25.745 --> 01:06:27.645
She's coming on again soon.

01:06:29.315 --> 01:06:30.805
He's a good kid.

01:06:30.983 --> 01:06:32.473
- You hope so.
- What do you mean?

01:06:33.486 --> 01:06:37.081
Far be it from me to start any trouble,
but I'll lay you 8-to-5 right now...

01:06:37.256 --> 01:06:39.417
...that kid's going to move in
on your gal.

01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:42.958
- I hope you know what you're talking about.
- Sure I do.

01:06:43.129 --> 01:06:45.222
Listen, Eddie.
I'm trying to steer you right.

01:06:45.398 --> 01:06:49.562
Listen, gals like her go for guys like that.
You know, with all that Joe College stuff.

01:06:50.002 --> 01:06:52.470
He'll take her to football games,
fraternity dances.

01:06:52.638 --> 01:06:54.333
All that rah-rah stuff.

01:06:54.507 --> 01:06:55.940
A kid like him can't miss.

01:06:57.143 --> 01:06:58.337
Calm down, Eddie.

01:06:58.511 --> 01:07:00.001
Maybe George is right.

01:07:00.179 --> 01:07:02.477
If he is, there's nothing
you can do about it.

01:07:02.648 --> 01:07:04.138
Shut up.

01:07:05.451 --> 01:07:06.918
I trust my friends.

01:07:13.492 --> 01:07:14.891
You know, he's a sucker.

01:07:15.061 --> 01:07:16.289
I don't trust mine.

01:07:16.629 --> 01:07:17.823
It's mutual, chump.

01:07:17.997 --> 01:07:19.589
They don't trust you, either.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.400
Tonight, I'll tell you a story.
What shall it be?

01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:26.333
- Little Freddie.
- But you've heard all about Little Freddie.

01:07:26.505 --> 01:07:27.870
Come in.

01:07:31.244 --> 01:07:34.077
- It was sweet of you to send me this radio.
- Does it work?

01:07:34.447 --> 01:07:37.939
Sure. I can hear every word as clear
as if the man was in the room.

01:07:38.117 --> 01:07:39.641
Are you able to get a lot of gab?

01:07:39.819 --> 01:07:42.379
Well, before my last number,
I had a band from Brooklyn.

01:07:42.555 --> 01:07:43.954
Yeah, that's science.

01:07:44.123 --> 01:07:47.718
Guy has to invent radio so you can pick up
a broken-down outfit in Brooklyn.

01:07:47.893 --> 01:07:50.453
How are-? How are your
singing lessons coming along?

01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:53.656
All right, but I don't think you
ought to waste your money on me.

01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:55.960
It's my money.
Besides, I ain't wasting it.

01:07:56.469 --> 01:07:59.131
- Say, you know where we're going Saturday?
- Where?

01:07:59.305 --> 01:08:01.398
New Haven. Going to see
that football game.

01:08:01.674 --> 01:08:04.199
Football? I didn't know
you liked football.

01:08:04.377 --> 01:08:08.973
I don't. But you can get to like anything
if you stick at it long enough, can't you?

01:08:09.548 --> 01:08:12.039
Yes, I suppose you can.

01:08:12.652 --> 01:08:13.710
Come in.

01:08:14.754 --> 01:08:17.689
Pardon me, but Panama told me
I'd find Eddie here.

01:08:18.124 --> 01:08:19.591
What do you want?

01:08:19.825 --> 01:08:23.693
You forgot to sign the checks for the
new cabs. I'll need them in the morning.

01:08:26.032 --> 01:08:27.897
I thought you gave a great show tonight.

01:08:28.067 --> 01:08:30.899
- Thank you.
- I see you have a new crystal set.

01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:34.095
- How's the reception?
- Ought to be good. Paid a lot for it.

01:08:34.774 --> 01:08:36.366
I guess that makes it good.

01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:38.169
That makes anything good.

01:08:39.444 --> 01:08:42.175
- Goodbye.
- Listen, I've got the news broadcast.

01:08:42.348 --> 01:08:43.712
You boys listen to it.

01:08:45.785 --> 01:08:49.243
- A whole lot easier reading the papers.
- Your news broadcaster is on the air.

01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:51.582
Here's a late news dispatch
that just came in.

01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:55.716
United States government warehouse
number 7 in New York was hijacked tonight.

01:08:55.895 --> 01:08:58.455
A quarter million dollars worth
of liquor was removed...

01:08:58.631 --> 01:09:00.599
...after two watchmen were shot down.

01:09:01.133 --> 01:09:05.627
One of the watchmen, Pete Jones, 42, was
already dead of bullet wounds when found.

01:09:05.805 --> 01:09:07.432
Jones was a World War veteran.

01:09:12.978 --> 01:09:16.243
- What did he say the watchman's name was?
- I didn't get it.

01:09:16.415 --> 01:09:18.781
It sounded like Pete Jones.

01:09:18.951 --> 01:09:21.511
That was the name of our
loudmouthed sergeant, remember?

01:09:21.687 --> 01:09:23.848
There are a lot of Joneses, ain't there?

01:09:24.223 --> 01:09:26.282
Eddie...

01:09:26.459 --> 01:09:28.426
...where were you
and George tonight?

01:09:29.495 --> 01:09:30.689
With you.

01:09:30.863 --> 01:09:33.798
Or maybe I don't remember.
Ain't that always the correct answer?

01:09:34.166 --> 01:09:37.430
Hey, Eddie. I just got tipped off.
Nick Brown's on his way over.

01:09:37.603 --> 01:09:39.729
- What'll I do?
- I'll handle him.

01:09:40.339 --> 01:09:41.828
See you later.

01:09:42.006 --> 01:09:43.837
You seem to be in an awful hurry.

01:09:44.009 --> 01:09:45.475
I have a lot of work tomorrow.

01:09:45.644 --> 01:09:47.111
I go on again in a few minutes.

01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:50.180
It'd be nice if you'd stay and
keep me company till then.

01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:52.180
I haven't seen so much of you lately.

01:09:52.818 --> 01:09:55.048
You're doing all right
without any help from me.

01:09:55.221 --> 01:09:56.449
Don't say that, Lloyd.

01:09:56.622 --> 01:09:58.487
You're afraid of the truth?

01:09:58.824 --> 01:10:02.419
I've told you time and time again
I can't hurt him.

01:10:02.628 --> 01:10:03.993
He's been so good to me.

01:10:04.163 --> 01:10:07.155
You'll get yourself in so deep,
you'll never be able to get out.

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:10.268
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Tell him the truth.

01:10:10.436 --> 01:10:13.132
Tell him that you don't love him,
that you-

01:10:14.173 --> 01:10:15.435
That I what, Lloyd?

01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:19.873
Just tell him that you don't love him.

01:10:20.045 --> 01:10:22.513
Lloyd, you're gonna stay
and see the show, aren't you?

01:10:22.681 --> 01:10:24.376
- Yeah.
- Oh, there's my cue.

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:26.142
I'll see you out there.

01:11:37.022 --> 01:11:38.250
Here he comes.

01:11:45.798 --> 01:11:47.857
You two guys think you're pretty cute.

01:11:48.033 --> 01:11:51.196
- Shut up. The girl is singing.
- Now, you listen to me.

01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:55.329
You tipped off the feds I was running in
a load last night, and they took it from me.

01:11:55.508 --> 01:11:57.601
He makes noise
when he eats spaghetti too.

01:11:57.776 --> 01:12:01.177
- And you lifted it from them.
- Quit talking through your hat.

01:12:02.214 --> 01:12:04.648
The watchman you knocked off
didn't die right away.

01:12:04.817 --> 01:12:07.081
- He talked.
- He was off his nut.

01:12:07.253 --> 01:12:10.347
You're cute, but not cute enough.

01:12:25.671 --> 01:12:26.865
Hey, wait a minute, folks!

01:12:27.039 --> 01:12:30.770
You're not gonna go home just because
some of the boys have a friendly argument!

01:12:30.943 --> 01:12:33.468
Come on, stick around.
We're gonna give away more loot.

01:12:33.646 --> 01:12:36.547
- What's your hurry?
- Man, get your boss.

01:12:36.949 --> 01:12:39.076
Come on.
Get this guy out of here.

01:12:39.685 --> 01:12:41.585
Throw him out in the street.

01:12:46.959 --> 01:12:48.551
Put your hat on. You'll catch cold.

01:12:48.727 --> 01:12:50.354
I hope.

01:12:50.796 --> 01:12:52.491
Wait a minute.

01:12:53.098 --> 01:12:55.066
Put these in water for me...

01:12:55.234 --> 01:12:56.462
...tramp.

01:12:58.604 --> 01:13:01.164
- Don't be frightened. It's all over.
- You all right?

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:03.501
Yes, but there were
innocent people there.

01:13:03.676 --> 01:13:07.009
I didn't have time to think of them.
Get to your dressing room, rest up.

01:13:07.179 --> 01:13:08.942
Take it easy. Go ahead. Go on.

01:13:09.114 --> 01:13:12.049
You can't come in my club
and make a shooting gallery out of it.

01:13:12.217 --> 01:13:13.980
I'll bet there's over $5000 of damage.

01:13:14.153 --> 01:13:17.350
Oh, crying again, huh? I'll tell you
what I'll do. You make a price...

01:13:17.523 --> 01:13:19.923
- ... on this rattrap and I'll buy it.
- You'll buy it?

01:13:20.092 --> 01:13:22.993
Yeah. I think a big boy like me
should have his own playground.

01:13:23.162 --> 01:13:26.131
- You two get together, draw up a contract.
- I'm not drawing up...

01:13:26.298 --> 01:13:27.663
...any more contracts for you.

01:13:27.833 --> 01:13:31.735
What's the matter? The shooting
give you the jitters too? Go on, beat it.

01:13:33.572 --> 01:13:36.132
Eddie, you stuck up that warehouse
tonight, didn't you?

01:13:36.308 --> 01:13:38.401
- You have good ears.
- You killed the watchman.

01:13:38.577 --> 01:13:40.909
- I wasn't anywhere near him.
- You were responsible.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.911
It couldn't be helped.

01:13:43.082 --> 01:13:45.710
You're getting excited over nothing.
Let's talk it over.

01:13:45.884 --> 01:13:48.444
No, Eddie, it won't work.
This is where I draw the line.

01:13:48.621 --> 01:13:50.555
I said I'm through, and I mean it.

01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:54.691
- Don't you wish it was that easy?
- Get out of my way.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:57.021
- Put that gun away.
- When I get good and ready.

01:13:57.196 --> 01:14:00.461
Friendship don't mean a thing to me.
This guy's got enough on us to-

01:14:00.633 --> 01:14:02.965
- He won't talk.
- He'd better not.

01:14:03.135 --> 01:14:05.603
Listen, you came into this racket
with your eyes open.

01:14:05.771 --> 01:14:07.398
You learned a lot and know a lot.

01:14:07.573 --> 01:14:11.475
If any of it gets out, you'll go out with
your eyes open, only with pennies on them.

01:14:11.644 --> 01:14:14.442
Now, scram. Get out of here.
Go on home and chase ambulances.

01:14:18.317 --> 01:14:20.979
- Where do you think you're going?
- To look for excitement.

01:14:21.153 --> 01:14:23.178
There's a lull in the joint.

01:14:31.096 --> 01:14:34.497
Now, look. Now that we got things fixed
with the right people in office...

01:14:34.667 --> 01:14:37.636
...we got to sort of arrange things
among ourselves, you hear?

01:14:37.803 --> 01:14:41.830
Which means that instead of shooting
things out, we gotta talk things out.

01:14:42.007 --> 01:14:44.305
We got to get a setup where
we work together.

01:14:45.978 --> 01:14:48.003
- Where's Nick Brown?
- I sent Danny after him.

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.613
I figured he might have forgot.

01:14:49.782 --> 01:14:52.842
There's no sense in going on without him.
He's gotta be in on this.

01:14:53.018 --> 01:14:56.283
Look, you guys go out to the bar,
get yourselves a drink on the house.

01:14:56.455 --> 01:14:59.185
- Good idea.
- I'd enjoy a good drink.

01:15:03.495 --> 01:15:05.895
You must have been reading
about Napoleon.

01:15:06.398 --> 01:15:07.422
What's bothering you?

01:15:07.599 --> 01:15:11.399
First, you used to ask me about things,
then you told me, now you ignore me.

01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:13.435
My feelings is getting hurt.

01:15:14.173 --> 01:15:16.471
Oh, my poor, delicate, little rosebud.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:18.735
Ain't that a shame?

01:15:19.111 --> 01:15:22.706
Just as long as your bankroll ain't hurt,
you got nothing to squawk about.

01:15:23.315 --> 01:15:26.910
When Brown comes, you can call me.
I'll be out in the club.

01:15:30.689 --> 01:15:32.680
Lefty, how do you like being a stooge?

01:15:32.858 --> 01:15:34.450
Oh, chief, I don't care.

01:15:34.626 --> 01:15:35.820
Well, I do.

01:15:35.994 --> 01:15:38.861
I think maybe I'll have to
do something about it.

01:15:46.538 --> 01:15:49.974
- I'm going in with you.
- Please, Lloyd, I want to tell him.

01:15:50.142 --> 01:15:51.404
All right, but tell him.

01:15:51.577 --> 01:15:55.138
I'm getting tired of sneaking around
back alleys in order to see you.

01:15:55.314 --> 01:15:57.179
If you don't tell him tonight, I will.

01:15:57.349 --> 01:15:59.249
I'll tell him. Tonight.

01:15:59.418 --> 01:16:01.181
Bye, darling.

01:16:01.353 --> 01:16:03.514
- I'll meet you here after the show.
- Okay.

01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:11.022
- Good evening, Miss Sherman.
- Good evening.

01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:24.736
- Eddie! Eddie!
- What's the matter?

01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:26.468
Danny!

01:16:27.412 --> 01:16:29.437
Go on inside.

01:16:45.998 --> 01:16:48.057
Bartlett, is this one of your boys?

01:16:48.233 --> 01:16:49.791
Yeah.

01:16:49.968 --> 01:16:51.629
He was.

01:16:57.276 --> 01:16:58.709
Well, Danny...

01:16:59.378 --> 01:17:01.903
...I told you this wasn't your racket.

01:17:12.691 --> 01:17:15.626
Get back there, now. Get back.
Come on. Get back there.

01:17:22.534 --> 01:17:24.331
What was all the screaming about?

01:17:24.503 --> 01:17:26.630
Brown just delivered Danny's body.

01:17:27.472 --> 01:17:29.872
- Get the boys together. We're on our way.
- Where?

01:17:30.042 --> 01:17:32.704
- Brown's.
- Not me. You're the big shot around here.

01:17:32.878 --> 01:17:34.869
I'm only the office boy.

01:17:35.047 --> 01:17:36.207
All right, little man.

01:17:36.381 --> 01:17:40.215
Polish up the cuspidors. When you
get through with your work, go home early.

01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:47.217
He'll be home early, feet first.

01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:50.788
Hello. Hello. Get me Orchard-8591.

01:17:52.264 --> 01:17:56.724
You know, I hate to do this to Eddie.
Him and me have been such good pals.

01:17:57.269 --> 01:18:00.261
- Hello, Nick Brown?
- Yeah. Yeah, this is Brown.

01:18:00.439 --> 01:18:03.340
- Who is this?
- It's your Aunt Sadie from Jersey City.

01:18:03.508 --> 01:18:07.171
Listen, Eddie Bartlett's
on his way over to pay you a call.

01:18:07.346 --> 01:18:09.507
Yeah. Okay.

01:18:10.282 --> 01:18:13.308
I always say when you got a job to do,
get somebody else to do it.

01:18:14.553 --> 01:18:16.714
Dinner's over. Get out.

01:18:16.889 --> 01:18:18.322
- Just a minute.
- I said, get out.

01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:20.390
The check is on me.
I hope you enjoyed it.

01:18:20.559 --> 01:18:22.493
Come on.
We're closing up the place.

01:18:22.661 --> 01:18:25.630
- But we haven't eaten yet.
- We've run out of food. Get out of here.

01:18:25.797 --> 01:18:28.595
Go on. Beat it. Scram, sisters,
spaghetti ain't good for you.

01:18:28.767 --> 01:18:31.235
Puts fat on the wrong places.
Get rid of these people.

01:18:31.403 --> 01:18:33.303
What's wrong?
You try to ruin my business?

01:18:33.472 --> 01:18:35.235
That ain't all that's gonna be ruined.

01:18:35.407 --> 01:18:37.875
Hey, wait a minute. You stay.

01:18:38.076 --> 01:18:41.102
- It's all right. We've finished.
- No. You're wrong. You're hungry.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.373
Bring these people another
order of spaghetti.

01:18:43.548 --> 01:18:46.312
But I've eaten
all the spaghetti that I can take.

01:18:46.485 --> 01:18:49.420
You'll eat more spaghetti and like it.
Now, shut up and sit down.

01:18:49.588 --> 01:18:52.216
Luigi, keep that electric piano going.

01:18:52.391 --> 01:18:54.325
Boys, Bartlett's on his way over.

01:18:54.493 --> 01:18:55.790
Now, you know what to do.

01:18:55.961 --> 01:18:57.519
Charlie, in the kitchen.

01:18:57.696 --> 01:19:00.859
Manny, under the counter.
Rocco, the phone booth, but keep low.

01:19:01.033 --> 01:19:03.593
Joey, you take the cloakroom.

01:19:03.769 --> 01:19:07.296
That's it. You stand around with that towel
as if nothing was going on.

01:19:07.472 --> 01:19:09.463
Now, eat as if you enjoyed it.

01:19:09.975 --> 01:19:13.570
When Bartlett arrives, give him
the courtesy of the place.

01:19:13.745 --> 01:19:16.737
Show him that old Southern hospitality.

01:19:32.197 --> 01:19:33.528
- Where's Brown?
- Brown?

01:19:33.699 --> 01:19:37.328
Oh, yes. He go out one hour ago,
but he's coming back.

01:19:38.103 --> 01:19:39.297
We can wait.

01:19:39.471 --> 01:19:42.065
Take it easy, boys.
Make yourselves comfortable.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.935
What are you sweating about?

01:19:44.643 --> 01:19:46.008
Nothing.

01:19:46.178 --> 01:19:47.839
It's hot here.

01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:54.051
- What's the matter, Mama?
- We want to get out of here.

01:19:54.219 --> 01:19:56.050
We want to get out of here!

01:20:47.072 --> 01:20:49.199
We have a special news bulletin.

01:20:49.374 --> 01:20:51.865
Gang violence flared up again
in New York tonight...

01:20:52.044 --> 01:20:55.070
...when three men died in a spaghetti
restaurant on the East Side.

01:20:55.247 --> 01:20:57.841
All were the victims of a gang battle
which transpired...

01:20:58.016 --> 01:21:01.281
...when one mob was trapped
in the restaurant by another faction.

01:21:01.453 --> 01:21:05.355
Among those who met their deaths are Nick
Brown, powerful East Side gang leader...

01:21:05.524 --> 01:21:08.755
...also Rocco, Brown's lieutenant,
and Manny Eckert.

01:21:08.927 --> 01:21:11.794
We return you now to the
marine room of the Edgecomb Hotel...

01:21:11.963 --> 01:21:14.557
...for music by Don McNeil
and his orchestra.

01:21:14.733 --> 01:21:18.362
That's right, George, you didn't get me.
Take your hand off that heater, Lefty.

01:21:20.639 --> 01:21:23.836
The only thing saving your neck is
I can't prove you dealt me a second.

01:21:24.009 --> 01:21:27.638
If I ever find out, I got one in
here with your name on it.

01:21:27.813 --> 01:21:29.474
Remember that.

01:21:39.291 --> 01:21:41.156
Well, good night, folks, and come again.

01:21:41.326 --> 01:21:44.853
Don't forget, next Friday night
we're gonna give away a Shetland pony.

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:46.827
Good night, folks.

01:21:49.701 --> 01:21:52.693
- I paid off for Danny.
- Yeah, I know. I heard it on the radio.

01:21:52.871 --> 01:21:54.532
Sit down.

01:21:57.042 --> 01:21:59.237
You know, I think I'll take Jean home.

01:21:59.644 --> 01:22:00.872
Jean's gone.

01:22:01.613 --> 01:22:03.171
She said she'd wait here for me.

01:22:03.348 --> 01:22:05.509
Eddie, I'll tell you something
you won't like.

01:22:05.684 --> 01:22:07.914
Jean's quit the club. Gave her notice.

01:22:08.086 --> 01:22:09.610
Quit? What for?

01:22:09.788 --> 01:22:12.086
Do I have to draw you a diagram?

01:22:12.257 --> 01:22:16.387
Now, look, if you're trying to say
something, get it off your chest and say it.

01:22:17.162 --> 01:22:19.027
Jean's in love.

01:22:19.197 --> 01:22:22.997
Now you're being full of news.
Sure she is. With me.

01:22:26.371 --> 01:22:28.999
Eddie, this is gonna be
kind of hard to take...

01:22:29.307 --> 01:22:31.502
...and I don't want you to get mad.

01:22:32.177 --> 01:22:34.077
Jean was never in love with you.

01:22:34.246 --> 01:22:37.682
She went hook, line and sinker
for that Lloyd guy the minute she saw him.

01:22:37.849 --> 01:22:40.716
And she's been seeing him every time
your back was turned.

01:22:40.886 --> 01:22:44.219
I tried to give you the steer,
but I guess I didn't get it over.

01:22:45.223 --> 01:22:46.850
Everybody knew it but you.

01:22:51.296 --> 01:22:53.856
Look, Eddie, as far as Jean
is concerned, you've been-

01:22:54.032 --> 01:22:55.863
Shut up!

01:22:56.201 --> 01:22:57.793
Okay.

01:23:06.011 --> 01:23:09.344
- Lloyd, did you hear about Danny?
- Yes, I did.

01:23:09.514 --> 01:23:11.778
All the more reason
you should leave that club.

01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:13.815
- I quit.
- Did you see Eddie?

01:23:13.985 --> 01:23:15.782
He didn't show up.

01:23:19.424 --> 01:23:21.358
We'll go back and wait for him.

01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:29.559
- Cab, Mr. Bartlett?
- Yeah, please.

01:23:42.614 --> 01:23:44.241
Never mind.

01:23:44.416 --> 01:23:46.179
I'll walk.

01:23:55.227 --> 01:23:56.660
Beat it.

01:23:58.063 --> 01:23:59.792
Beat it.

01:24:01.866 --> 01:24:05.233
- Eddie, listen to me-
- What are you trying to prove?

01:24:12.777 --> 01:24:14.540
Nothing, kid.

01:24:15.714 --> 01:24:17.045
Nothing.

01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:20.511
I'm sorry.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.210
Sorry.

01:24:41.172 --> 01:24:43.800
Does Eddie know that Jean walked out?

01:24:43.975 --> 01:24:46.603
I don't think so.
Suppose you tell him.

01:24:47.345 --> 01:24:49.506
- Here he is.
- Hey, look...

01:24:49.681 --> 01:24:51.945
...how's that booze
I've been peddling? Any good?

01:24:52.117 --> 01:24:55.052
- Better than most.
- All right, let's sample a bottle.

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:58.155
No, make it two.
One for you and one for me.

01:24:58.323 --> 01:25:00.018
Who can tell? I might like it.

01:25:00.492 --> 01:25:03.393
Hey. Come here.

01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:09.023
1929. As the dizzy decade nears its end...

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.065
...the country is stock-market crazy.

01:25:11.670 --> 01:25:14.901
The great and the humble,
the rich man and the working man...

01:25:15.073 --> 01:25:19.442
...the housewife and the shopgirl
all take their daily flier in the market...

01:25:19.611 --> 01:25:22.307
...and no one seems to lose.

01:25:24.215 --> 01:25:26.911
Then, like a bombshell,
comes that never-to-be-forgotten...

01:25:27.085 --> 01:25:29.918
...Black Tuesday, October 29th.

01:25:30.088 --> 01:25:33.717
Confusion spreads through the canyons
of New York City's financial district.

01:25:33.892 --> 01:25:37.157
And men stare wild-eyed
at the spectacle of complete ruin.

01:25:37.562 --> 01:25:42.124
More than 16.5 million shares change hands
in a single day of frenzied selling.

01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:44.768
The paper fortunes built up
over the past few years...

01:25:44.936 --> 01:25:47.200
...crumble into nothing
before this disaster...

01:25:47.372 --> 01:25:50.307
...which is to touch every man, woman
and child in America.

01:25:53.912 --> 01:25:55.243
Hey, boys!

01:26:03.321 --> 01:26:06.449
- Now what do you want?
- I need 200,000 to cover your account.

01:26:06.624 --> 01:26:09.684
- I gave you 200 grand.
- I need it again. I'll give you an hour.

01:26:09.861 --> 01:26:13.297
- If you don't have it, I'll have to sell you out.
- All right, I'll get it.

01:26:17.902 --> 01:26:19.460
There you are. That's five more.

01:26:19.637 --> 01:26:22.367
You must be sneaking lessons
on the side.

01:26:23.942 --> 01:26:27.309
- What, are you still around?
- George, I've got no time to waste.

01:26:27.479 --> 01:26:29.071
I need 200 grand.

01:26:29.247 --> 01:26:31.078
Yeah? What am I
supposed to do about it?

01:26:31.249 --> 01:26:32.876
Will you put away that thing?

01:26:33.051 --> 01:26:35.884
Look, I'll sell you 40 percent
of my cab company for 200,000.

01:26:36.054 --> 01:26:37.715
I don't want 40 percent of anything.

01:26:37.889 --> 01:26:40.084
- That's a lot of cabs, chief.
- Over 6000.

01:26:40.258 --> 01:26:43.352
I'll tell you what. I'll give you
250 grand for the whole company.

01:26:43.528 --> 01:26:47.123
Are you nuts? Those guys from Chicago
offered me two million three months ago.

01:26:47.298 --> 01:26:48.629
Okay, then. Sell it to them.

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:51.064
But I can't get to them.
I need the money now.

01:26:51.236 --> 01:26:54.637
You heard my offer: 250 grand.
Take it or leave it.

01:26:55.507 --> 01:26:56.940
I'll take it.

01:26:57.108 --> 01:26:58.803
Okay, it's a deal.

01:26:58.977 --> 01:27:01.468
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
for you, Eddie.

01:27:01.913 --> 01:27:03.847
I ain't gonna take all your cabs away.

01:27:04.015 --> 01:27:05.209
What's the hitch?

01:27:05.383 --> 01:27:07.908
I'm gonna leave you one, just one...

01:27:08.086 --> 01:27:10.953
...because you're going to need it, pal.

01:27:12.657 --> 01:27:16.457
First to feel the effects of the economic
disaster which sweeps the country...

01:27:16.628 --> 01:27:20.120
...are the nightclubs, the speakeasies,
and the bootleggers who serve them.

01:27:20.298 --> 01:27:23.324
With the falling off of profits
in the illegal liquor industry...

01:27:23.501 --> 01:27:26.061
...the mobsters have difficulty
in paying protection.

01:27:26.237 --> 01:27:29.729
And the number of raids, arrests
and convictions double and quadruple.

01:27:30.542 --> 01:27:33.909
Then in the depth of the economic despair
that has gripped the country...

01:27:34.112 --> 01:27:37.081
...Franklin Delano Roosevelt
is elected president...

01:27:37.348 --> 01:27:40.283
...partially on the basis of his promise
to end Prohibition.

01:27:41.085 --> 01:27:45.988
In New York City, thousands of jubilant
citizens march in a great beer parade...

01:27:46.157 --> 01:27:49.615
...and shortly, 3.2 beer becomes legal.

01:27:49.794 --> 01:27:52.820
Finally comes the national
referendum on repeal.

01:27:53.131 --> 01:27:57.192
Tired of years of violence, corruption,
and loss of personal liberty...

01:27:57.435 --> 01:28:00.666
...Americans go to the polls
and overwhelmingly rout the dry forces.

01:28:01.606 --> 01:28:05.337
After 13 years, Prohibition is dead...

01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:08.968
...leaving in its wake a criminal element
used to wealth and power...

01:28:09.147 --> 01:28:12.480
...but unable, for the most part,
to cope with the new determination...

01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:16.279
...by an aroused public that
law and order should once more reign.

01:28:22.126 --> 01:28:24.594
- Taxi.
- Hey, taxi.

01:28:28.666 --> 01:28:32.727
- Where to, lady?
-331 Quigley Place, Forest Hills.

01:28:32.904 --> 01:28:35.372
331 Quigley Place, Forest Hills.

01:28:51.289 --> 01:28:52.813
Eddie.

01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:56.188
Yeah, I heard.
331 Quigley Place, Forest Hills.

01:28:56.427 --> 01:28:57.894
Eddie, it's me, Jean.

01:28:59.564 --> 01:29:02.499
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:29:03.034 --> 01:29:04.695
How have you been getting along?

01:29:05.637 --> 01:29:07.195
I eat.

01:29:07.805 --> 01:29:10.638
- How's Panama?
- All right.

01:29:10.808 --> 01:29:12.332
Where is she now?

01:29:13.912 --> 01:29:15.436
She's around.

01:29:18.116 --> 01:29:19.708
Lloyd's been doing pretty well.

01:29:19.884 --> 01:29:21.943
He's with the district attorney's office.

01:29:22.587 --> 01:29:25.852
So I've been reading in the papers.
He should do all right in that job.

01:29:26.024 --> 01:29:28.458
I don't suppose you knew,
but we have a baby now.

01:29:28.626 --> 01:29:30.821
A boy. He's over 4.

01:29:41.072 --> 01:29:44.769
We'd better hide this sleigh someplace
or the kid's gonna want to go for a ride.

01:29:44.943 --> 01:29:47.639
- Just put it behind the sofa.
- Over here?

01:29:51.549 --> 01:29:54.575
- Let me take your coat.
- No, thanks. I can stay only a minute.

01:29:54.786 --> 01:29:57.914
- How about some coffee?
- No, I don't care for anything, honestly.

01:30:01.926 --> 01:30:04.019
- Hello, Mommy!
- Hello, darling.

01:30:04.195 --> 01:30:07.289
- You been a good boy today?
- I just killed three Indians.

01:30:07.599 --> 01:30:09.066
Stick them up, mister.

01:30:09.233 --> 01:30:11.599
You got me, pal. You got me.

01:30:11.769 --> 01:30:14.567
Bobby, this is Mr. Bartlett,
a friend of mine and your dad's.

01:30:14.739 --> 01:30:16.604
Hello. Can you shoot a gun?

01:30:16.774 --> 01:30:18.742
Yeah, I can, but I haven't done it lately.

01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:21.879
Come over someday,
and shoot Indians with me.

01:30:22.113 --> 01:30:23.341
It's a date.

01:30:23.514 --> 01:30:25.243
It's Daddy!

01:30:27.485 --> 01:30:30.215
- Hello, Daddy!
- Hello there, Buffalo Bill.

01:30:30.388 --> 01:30:31.616
How's my cowboy today?

01:30:31.789 --> 01:30:34.485
- Fine. How about the funny papers?
- Oh, sure.

01:30:34.659 --> 01:30:37.287
- Here they are.
- Thank you.

01:30:40.031 --> 01:30:41.259
Why, Eddie.

01:30:41.766 --> 01:30:44.735
Well, this is a surprise.

01:30:45.703 --> 01:30:48.001
- It's nice to see you.
- Hi.

01:30:48.172 --> 01:30:49.537
- Hello, dear.
- Hello.

01:30:49.974 --> 01:30:51.202
Well, you're looking great.

01:30:51.376 --> 01:30:54.243
Thanks. I drove Jean out from town,
with her Christmas shopping.

01:30:54.412 --> 01:30:57.472
- Well, good.
- It was good to see you. I guess I'll be going.

01:30:57.649 --> 01:31:00.311
- Won't you stay for dinner?
- No, I can't. I've got a date.

01:31:00.485 --> 01:31:03.454
Oh, come on, Eddie. It'll be fun.
We could talk over old times.

01:31:03.655 --> 01:31:05.646
No, I- Really, I got to get back to town.

01:31:05.823 --> 01:31:08.018
Oh, that's too bad.
Some other time, maybe.

01:31:08.359 --> 01:31:11.055
- Yeah. We'll do it some other time.
- Oh, Eddie...

01:31:12.563 --> 01:31:14.087
If there's anything I can do...

01:31:14.265 --> 01:31:17.598
Oh, there's... I'm not looking
for any favors from nobody.

01:31:17.769 --> 01:31:21.466
I just ran into a streak of bad luck,
that's all. I'll be up there on top again.

01:31:21.639 --> 01:31:25.735
- I just got to figure a new angle.
- Eddie, the days of the rackets are over.

01:31:25.977 --> 01:31:27.945
Don't you kid yourself about that.

01:31:28.112 --> 01:31:31.946
There will always be guys trying to get up
there quick, and I'm one of them.

01:31:33.985 --> 01:31:38.422
I know you take your job very seriously,
and I'll give you some good advice.

01:31:38.589 --> 01:31:41.581
The papers say the district
attorney's office is building up...

01:31:41.759 --> 01:31:44.557
- ... a case against our friend George.
- It's already built up.

01:31:44.729 --> 01:31:47.197
Remember what George said
would happen if you talked?

01:31:47.365 --> 01:31:48.992
I remember.

01:31:49.867 --> 01:31:51.596
So does he.

01:31:54.105 --> 01:31:56.596
Eddie, if I don't see you again,
merry Christmas.

01:31:57.175 --> 01:31:59.200
- Thanks.
- Same here, Eddie.

01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:01.310
Merry Christmas to you.

01:32:01.479 --> 01:32:04.209
Oh, Eddie, I didn't pay you.
Lloyd, I owe him $3.20.

01:32:04.415 --> 01:32:07.612
Never mind. Buy a
Christmas present for the kid.

01:32:16.928 --> 01:32:20.022
Hey, what time do these lawyers
go to work, anyhow?

01:32:23.101 --> 01:32:25.092
- That's him now, ain't it?
- Yeah.

01:32:25.269 --> 01:32:26.634
Yeah.

01:32:27.705 --> 01:32:30.071
- Bring me back something.
- All right, Bobby.

01:32:30.641 --> 01:32:32.734
Come on, honey. In you go.

01:32:46.357 --> 01:32:49.383
- What do you want?
- We got a message for you from George.

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.529
He says your boyfriend should bury
what the D.A.'s got on him...

01:32:52.697 --> 01:32:56.030
...because if your boyfriend don't bury it,
he'll get buried instead.

01:32:56.534 --> 01:32:57.933
That's all.

01:33:06.377 --> 01:33:09.107
Pardon me. Do you know a taxi driver
named Eddie Bartlett?

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.510
- He picked me up here about a week ago.
- I don't.

01:33:11.682 --> 01:33:14.583
- Why don't you ask one of those drivers?
- Well, thanks.

01:33:15.753 --> 01:33:18.085
- Do either of you know Eddie Bartlett?
- I know him.

01:33:18.256 --> 01:33:20.656
- Where can I find him?
- I haven't seen him in a week.

01:33:20.825 --> 01:33:24.818
Last time I saw him, he shouldn't have been
driving his cab. He was oiled to the gills.

01:33:24.996 --> 01:33:27.897
Ask the boys at the Royal Hotel.
They might have seen him.

01:33:28.065 --> 01:33:29.259
Thanks.

01:33:29.433 --> 01:33:32.368
I saw him a couple of days ago,
and is he on that bottle.

01:33:32.537 --> 01:33:34.869
If you want to find him,
look in the saloons.

01:33:35.039 --> 01:33:37.872
- Don't you know where he lives?
- Yeah. In the saloons.

01:33:38.042 --> 01:33:39.805
- Well, which one?
- Search me, lady.

01:33:39.977 --> 01:33:42.377
You might ask some of the boys
over at Grand Central.

01:33:42.547 --> 01:33:43.605
Thanks.

01:33:43.848 --> 01:33:46.408
Maybe he's at that dive
where that off-key canary sings.

01:33:46.584 --> 01:33:49.052
Yeah, that's right.
Flannigan's joint on Third Avenue.

01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:51.347
- Flannigan's joint?
- Come on, I'll take you.

01:33:51.522 --> 01:33:52.511
Thanks.

01:34:51.315 --> 01:34:53.340
All right, professor, fold it up.

01:34:53.784 --> 01:34:57.151
Of all the dog-and-pony joints
I've worked in, this tops them all.

01:34:57.355 --> 01:34:59.152
Never mind, honey.
I like you.

01:34:59.390 --> 01:35:01.551
Well, happy New Year.

01:35:02.159 --> 01:35:03.319
It's a wet one, anyway.

01:35:06.297 --> 01:35:07.924
They sure had a swell kid.

01:35:08.099 --> 01:35:09.464
Yeah, you told me.

01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:11.295
And Jean...

01:35:11.469 --> 01:35:14.165
- Jean looks-
- Yeah, you told me about that too.

01:35:14.338 --> 01:35:15.896
Jean gets prettier all the time.

01:35:16.607 --> 01:35:19.474
I've heard the same thing
day after day for the past week.

01:35:19.810 --> 01:35:23.075
I'm sick of watching you try to put out
that torch you carry for her...

01:35:23.247 --> 01:35:24.737
...with a lot of cheap hooch.

01:35:30.521 --> 01:35:32.250
Who's the kid look like?

01:35:32.757 --> 01:35:33.985
Like her.

01:35:34.625 --> 01:35:36.217
And they got a nice house?

01:35:36.394 --> 01:35:39.192
Yeah, it's a nice house,
if you like that kind of a house...

01:35:39.463 --> 01:35:41.624
...but for me, I'll take a hotel anytime.

01:35:41.799 --> 01:35:44.029
- You know that.
- Me too.

01:35:44.201 --> 01:35:49.070
Ain't it funny how our tastes have always run
the same, ever since the first time we met?

01:35:49.407 --> 01:35:51.568
I can just picture you living
in the suburbs...

01:35:51.742 --> 01:35:54.438
...working in a garden,
raising flowers and kids.

01:35:54.612 --> 01:35:56.512
Would that be a laugh.

01:35:57.048 --> 01:35:59.016
Yeah, wouldn't I look cute?

01:36:14.498 --> 01:36:17.592
- Hello, Jean.
- We were just talking about you. Sit down.

01:36:17.768 --> 01:36:20.293
- Why are you here?
- I've been looking for you all day.

01:36:20.504 --> 01:36:22.529
A taxi driver finally told me
where you were.

01:36:22.707 --> 01:36:24.004
- I'm in trouble.
- What is it?

01:36:24.175 --> 01:36:26.735
You were right about George.
Today two of his men came-

01:36:26.911 --> 01:36:29.106
- Knock over Lloyd?
- No, but they threatened to.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.942
- You've got to help me.
- What do you want me to do?

01:36:32.116 --> 01:36:33.549
Go to George. Talk to him.

01:36:34.251 --> 01:36:35.878
Why should I?

01:36:36.053 --> 01:36:37.680
Lloyd will be killed.

01:36:37.855 --> 01:36:39.584
He won't be if he does as he's told.

01:36:39.757 --> 01:36:42.555
Oh, but he can't. It's his duty.

01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:46.552
Yeah, sure it's his duty.
And it's George's duty to stop him.

01:36:47.598 --> 01:36:52.467
- I'd do the same thing in George's place.
- Eddie, please. For my sake.

01:36:56.807 --> 01:36:58.035
Sit down.

01:37:01.012 --> 01:37:05.642
Same old story. Same old story. Anytime
she wants anything, she comes to me.

01:37:05.816 --> 01:37:08.614
I suppose that's all I ever
meant to you anyway.

01:37:09.387 --> 01:37:11.252
No soap, no.

01:37:11.422 --> 01:37:13.822
Maybe a patsy once, but never twice.

01:37:13.991 --> 01:37:16.755
I don't see how it's gonna
do any harm to talk to George.

01:37:16.927 --> 01:37:19.589
Talk? There's only one language
George understands.

01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:23.459
If you think I'm gonna walk into a bullet
just because that husband of hers...

01:37:23.634 --> 01:37:26.398
...doesn't know enough to keep his trap
shut, you're crazy.

01:37:29.907 --> 01:37:32.501
- No dice, Jean. No dice.
- Now, look.

01:37:32.676 --> 01:37:33.904
No.

01:37:35.446 --> 01:37:39.314
All right, Eddie.
I just thought I'd ask.

01:37:44.789 --> 01:37:47.223
Well, go ahead and say it.

01:37:47.391 --> 01:37:49.484
You just said it all.

01:37:49.693 --> 01:37:53.823
Eddie, you've got to do something for them.
She's got something to look forward to.

01:37:53.998 --> 01:37:56.523
- Well, so have I.
- What?

01:37:57.301 --> 01:37:58.825
I'll be up there again.

01:37:59.370 --> 01:38:01.634
Eddie, you're kidding yourself.
The race is over.

01:38:01.806 --> 01:38:04.240
We're both finished out of the money.

01:38:04.975 --> 01:38:08.001
- Maybe for you, but not for me.
- It's over for all of us...

01:38:08.179 --> 01:38:10.170
...you, me and George.

01:38:10.347 --> 01:38:12.008
Eddie, something new is happening.

01:38:12.450 --> 01:38:13.940
Something you don't understand.

01:38:14.118 --> 01:38:16.552
Hey, what's going on here?

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.314
Come on, break it up.
Am I paying you to sing or gab?

01:38:19.490 --> 01:38:22.755
Now, just a minute.
You remember me. I'm Eddie Bartlett.

01:38:22.927 --> 01:38:24.519
Used to sell you your booze.

01:38:25.396 --> 01:38:27.626
Yeah, sure I remember.

01:38:27.798 --> 01:38:31.165
And fine poison it used to be too,
at fancy prices.

01:38:31.335 --> 01:38:35.032
Yeah, you used to be quite a guy
in the old days, didn't you?

01:38:35.206 --> 01:38:37.003
That's right.
Practically ran this town.

01:38:37.174 --> 01:38:38.732
Well, you don't now, so beat it.

01:38:38.909 --> 01:38:40.137
Wait a minute.

01:38:41.312 --> 01:38:43.246
On your way before I
have you kicked out.

01:38:43.514 --> 01:38:46.210
- Start singing.
- Get yourself a phonograph, jughead.

01:38:46.383 --> 01:38:49.648
I'm with him.
Come on, Eddie. I'll get my coat.

01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:28.055
You're right, Panama.

01:39:28.459 --> 01:39:30.757
We have finished out of the money.

01:39:45.643 --> 01:39:47.042
You wait here for me, huh?

01:39:47.211 --> 01:39:48.576
I'd better go with you.

01:39:48.779 --> 01:39:52.180
- No, you better stay right where you are.
- Eddie...

01:39:52.349 --> 01:39:53.543
...be careful.

01:39:53.717 --> 01:39:55.548
Don't worry about me, baby.

01:39:56.187 --> 01:39:57.848
I can take care of myself.

01:39:58.022 --> 01:40:00.354
And maybe George too.

01:40:22.379 --> 01:40:25.314
- What do you want?
- I want to see George. It's important.

01:40:25.482 --> 01:40:28.974
I don't know, Eddie.
I don't know if he'll see you or not.

01:40:30.187 --> 01:40:33.122
Sure. Take him up.
Give the boss a laugh.

01:40:35.259 --> 01:40:36.726
Come on.

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.631
How do you like that?

01:40:44.802 --> 01:40:46.235
He sure hit the skids.

01:40:46.403 --> 01:40:49.395
The rags of his pants are beating
him to death.

01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:55.005
Well, well, well.

01:40:58.249 --> 01:41:00.183
When did you get out?

01:41:00.718 --> 01:41:04.415
Oh, I get it. Taking advantage of my
good nature on New Year's Eve, huh?

01:41:04.588 --> 01:41:06.488
All right, I'll go for it. How much?

01:41:06.657 --> 01:41:08.591
I don't want no money.

01:41:08.759 --> 01:41:11.387
Don't tell me you came
to wish me happy New Year?

01:41:11.562 --> 01:41:12.824
Something like that.

01:41:13.297 --> 01:41:15.731
All right, many thanks
and the same to you.

01:41:16.033 --> 01:41:17.398
Goodbye, now, Eddie. I'm busy.

01:41:17.568 --> 01:41:19.695
I came to talk to you about Lloyd.

01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:22.634
- There ain't nothing to talk about.
- I think there is.

01:41:23.674 --> 01:41:25.164
Get him out of here, Lefty.

01:41:25.743 --> 01:41:27.210
All right, Eddie, on your way.

01:41:27.378 --> 01:41:31.712
Wait a minute, George. If you get rid of Lloyd
there'll always be someone to take his place.

01:41:31.882 --> 01:41:35.181
- I'll worry about that when it happens.
- But they got a kid.

01:41:38.622 --> 01:41:41.022
Still carrying a torch for that dame, huh?

01:41:41.392 --> 01:41:43.553
- Suppose I am?
- Then what are you beefing about?

01:41:43.727 --> 01:41:45.695
I'm doing you a favor by knocking him off.

01:41:45.863 --> 01:41:48.263
- I warned him to keep his mouth shut.
- But he can't.

01:41:48.432 --> 01:41:50.696
There's a new kind of setup
you don't understand.

01:41:50.868 --> 01:41:53.393
Guys don't go tearing things apart
like we used to.

01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:57.563
People try to build things up. That's what
Lloyd's trying to do. In this new setup...

01:41:57.741 --> 01:41:59.572
...you and me don't belong.

01:41:59.743 --> 01:42:03.042
Maybe you don't.
I do all right, anytime, anyplace.

01:42:05.382 --> 01:42:06.849
Well...

01:42:07.017 --> 01:42:09.508
...I guess we'll let it go at that, George.

01:42:10.988 --> 01:42:12.853
Where are you going, Eddie?

01:42:13.791 --> 01:42:15.349
Home.

01:42:17.261 --> 01:42:18.489
It's late.

01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:21.427
Lefty and a couple of the boys
will go with you.

01:42:21.932 --> 01:42:25.026
I don't want you walking the streets
alone at night.

01:42:28.706 --> 01:42:31.641
- Really going to take good care of me, huh?
- Yeah.

01:42:32.309 --> 01:42:35.938
You said you didn't belong in this setup,
so I'm getting you out of it fast.

01:42:36.113 --> 01:42:39.378
Sorry, but this is how it adds up.
You're still in love with that girl.

01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:41.211
You'd do anything to help her.

01:42:41.618 --> 01:42:43.643
You got more on me
than any guy in this town.

01:42:43.821 --> 01:42:47.814
And I'll lay you odds that you'll go
to the cops and spill everything you know.

01:42:48.292 --> 01:42:50.954
Well, I'm just gonna beat you
to the finish.

01:42:51.228 --> 01:42:54.254
Goodbye, Eddie, and happy New Year.

01:42:59.269 --> 01:43:02.261
Get them up, George.
So you thought I'd yell copper, huh?

01:43:02.439 --> 01:43:04.407
I never did that in my life
and never will.

01:43:04.575 --> 01:43:07.271
If I want anything done, I do it myself.

01:43:07.711 --> 01:43:08.905
Yeah.

01:43:09.079 --> 01:43:10.979
You always was a fair guy, Eddie.

01:43:11.148 --> 01:43:13.480
I'll make a deal with you.
We'll be partners again.

01:43:14.818 --> 01:43:18.720
I'll take the heat off Lloyd,
beat the rap some other way.

01:43:22.092 --> 01:43:23.923
Eddie... Crazy...

01:43:24.094 --> 01:43:25.322
Eddie, don't-

01:43:25.829 --> 01:43:27.729
- Eddie.
- This is one rap you won't beat.

01:43:32.703 --> 01:43:34.830
Sounds like Eddie talked out of turn.

01:43:36.373 --> 01:43:37.601
Get up.

01:43:44.248 --> 01:43:45.545
Open that door.

01:43:49.353 --> 01:43:51.048
Get them up.

01:43:51.622 --> 01:43:53.146
You like to laugh, do you?

01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:55.251
See if you think this is funny.

01:44:18.515 --> 01:44:19.914
Eddie! Eddie!

01:44:23.387 --> 01:44:24.979
Eddie!

01:44:34.598 --> 01:44:36.691
Drop it! Drop it!

01:44:46.877 --> 01:44:48.708
Eddie.

01:45:01.358 --> 01:45:02.848
Eddie.

01:45:15.272 --> 01:45:16.466
He's dead.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:18.767
Who is this guy?

01:45:19.076 --> 01:45:20.805
This is Eddie Bartlett.

01:45:20.978 --> 01:45:22.741
How were you hooked up with him?

01:45:26.650 --> 01:45:28.880
I'll never figure it out.

01:45:29.052 --> 01:45:31.077
What was his business?

01:45:36.727 --> 01:45:38.991
He used to be a big shot.
