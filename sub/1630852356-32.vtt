Uh, they're dangerous
and expensive.

08:27.724 --> 08:30.510
Only noisy idiots
love those dinky boats.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.512
Well, I must be
a noisy idiot then,

08:32.555 --> 08:34.601
because I got Jet Ski fever!

08:34.644 --> 08:36.385
It really is you guys.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.039
Now, come on,
we've got to download you

08:38.082 --> 08:39.519
back into your bodies.

08:39.562 --> 08:40.781
[Cricket]
But sister dearest,

08:40.824 --> 08:42.826
those bodies belong to us:

08:42.870 --> 08:44.872
the flawless family.

08:44.915 --> 08:47.875
Oh, yeah? Just try and stop us,
Mr. Hoity-Toity.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.747
We will mow you clowns down.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.053
As you wish.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.185
- Let's go, family.
- [all] Yeah!

08:54.229 --> 08:55.709
Go get 'em!

08:55.752 --> 08:57.537
[all yell]

08:58.625 --> 09:00.931
[grunting]

09:02.063 --> 09:03.368
We're perfectly matched.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.935
How are we going to beat them?

09:04.979 --> 09:07.547
Use what they don't have:
your flaws.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.810
Got it. Hey,
look over there: dirty laundry.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.173
Oh, I'd better start
washing the--

09:11.202 --> 09:12.595
Yeah!

09:12.639 --> 09:15.119
Boy, oh, boy,
I could do this all day.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.687
Gee, I bet you're so strong,
you could take a hit to the face

09:17.731 --> 09:18.993
and feel nothing.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.777
You're darn tooting.

09:20.821 --> 09:21.996
Watch this.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.041
[laughs]

09:24.085 --> 09:26.696
Why don't we sit down over tea
and talk this through?

09:26.740 --> 09:28.002
Hm. Nah!

09:28.045 --> 09:29.917
[yells]

09:29.960 --> 09:31.919
I got to get
to the control console-- Ah!

09:31.962 --> 09:34.027
[Gwendolyn] Hold it right there,
Little Miss Mess It Up.

09:34.051 --> 09:37.577
Admit that you're flawed
already and let me fix you.

09:37.620 --> 09:41.624
I admit it. My flaw was wanting
to make my family perfect.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.844
But there's no such thing
as a perfect family,

09:43.887 --> 09:46.063
because being flawed
is what makes us human.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.456
[gasps]

09:47.499 --> 09:49.284
Ah-ha! The flaw!

09:50.677 --> 09:52.069
[computerized voice]
Error.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.897
If wanting to erase flaws
is a flaw,

09:53.941 --> 09:56.596
then would flawlessness mean
embracing flaws?

09:56.639 --> 09:58.249
- [rumbling]
- Does not compute.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.816
System crash imminent.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.078
Whoa! Huh?

10:02.253 --> 10:03.907
Fascinating.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.127
The system is resetting itself
with all of us in it.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.913
What a fun way go out,
huh, Tilly?

10:09.957 --> 10:12.220
Oh, my stars!
We've got to get out of here.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.701
You marshmallows
didn't stand a chance.

10:14.744 --> 10:17.225
We have to get back
into our bodies, now!

10:17.268 --> 10:19.531
I don't feel so good.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.055
[all panting]

10:22.056 --> 10:23.623
I'm losing ground! Aah!

10:24.972 --> 10:26.495
[all grunt and yell]

10:29.019 --> 10:30.891
[all]
Whoa!

10:30.934 --> 10:32.675
[Tilly]Got it!

10:32.719 --> 10:34.155
[gasps]
Whew!

10:34.198 --> 10:35.939
That sure was messed up.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.246
I'm so sorry for trying
to fix you guys.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.640
I like you just the way you are.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.008
Thanks, sweetie,
but we could work on

10:42.032 --> 10:43.643
improving ourselves a bit.

10:43.686 --> 10:44.968
- Speak for yourself.
- Speak for yourself.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.471
[Gwendolyn]
I can't believe it.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.822
There was a flaw
inside of Flawless You.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.433
Gwendolyn? You didn't die
in the computer?

10:51.476 --> 10:52.913
Oh, I definitely died.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.045
Luckily, my brain was restored
from a backup.

10:55.089 --> 10:58.266
Always back up your brain,
that's what I like to say.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.050
[cackles maniacally]
