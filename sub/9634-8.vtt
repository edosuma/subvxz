01:51.292 --> 01:54.500
[NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon
Ball, Goku and Chi-Chi searched

01:54.584 --> 01:57.542
for the island home of
Master Roshi, who possesses

01:57.625 --> 02:01.750
a magic fan capable of putting
out the flames of Fire Mountain.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.042
[GOKU] I see it
down there, ChiChi!

02:05.125 --> 02:06.084
[GOKU] Hold on.

02:07.125 --> 02:08.292
[GOKU] Hello!!

02:08.375 --> 02:09.334
[ROSHI] Hmm? 

02:10.250 --> 02:11.375
Hi!

02:12.584 --> 02:14.500
What the...
Well, I'll be darned!

02:14.584 --> 02:17.167
It's my young friend
with the Flying Nimbus!

02:17.500 --> 02:20.834
[GOKU laughing]

02:20.917 --> 02:21.875
[GOKU] Here we come!

02:23.459 --> 02:25.417
You're clear for landing!

02:27.792 --> 02:30.750
That old guy is Master Roshi?

02:31.292 --> 02:33.750
[ROSHI laughing]

02:41.500 --> 02:43.334
[ROSHI] I had a feeling
I'd see you again.

02:43.417 --> 02:44.834
I still have the
Flying Nimbus!

02:44.917 --> 02:45.625
It's great!

02:45.709 --> 02:46.584
[ROSHI] Still have it?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.084
[GOKU] Uh-huh.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.584
[ROSHI] I'm not surprised.
Why, if I didn't know better,

02:49.667 --> 02:52.417
I'd say that cloud
was made for you!

02:52.500 --> 02:55.792
Yeah, we get along great!
We're friends now!

02:58.709 --> 03:01.250
Hey Goku? What happened
to your friend here?

03:01.334 --> 03:05.834
Last time I saw her she was
taller, and, uh, prettier, and,

03:05.917 --> 03:08.334
well, you know, she
bigger too... heh...

03:08.959 --> 03:10.625
Now she's, uh, not!

03:12.584 --> 03:14.792
Oh, yeah.
Well, that was Bulma,

03:14.875 --> 03:16.167
but this girl's ChiChi.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.792
[GOKU] Her dad's
the Ox-King!

03:17.875 --> 03:18.959
[CHICHI] Mm-hmm!

03:19.042 --> 03:20.209
[ROSHI] Really?

03:20.292 --> 03:21.709
[GOKU] He's the one who
asked us to come here.

03:21.792 --> 03:23.584
[CHICHI] Mm-hmm.

03:23.667 --> 03:27.542
[ROSHI] Hmm. Well,
the Ox-King, huh?

03:27.625 --> 03:30.334
[ROSHI] Why, I haven't
heard from him in years.

03:30.417 --> 03:32.042
[ROSHI] You know, I used
to train that little guy!

03:32.125 --> 03:34.000
--[ROSHI rambling]
--Psst! Hey, Goku!

03:34.084 --> 03:36.417
Are you sure this guy's Roshi?

03:36.500 --> 03:37.834
That's him!

03:37.917 --> 03:40.125
Well, we'll just
see about that!

03:41.250 --> 03:44.584
Before I believe that
he's a Martial Arts Master.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.500
He's gonna have to prove it!

03:46.584 --> 03:48.125
Huh?

03:48.209 --> 03:52.250
[ROSHI rambling]

03:59.542 --> 04:02.084
If he can avoid
it, then he's Roshi!

04:07.500 --> 04:08.959
[crack]

04:09.042 --> 04:12.292
[whimpering]

04:12.375 --> 04:13.750
[screaming]

04:13.834 --> 04:15.584
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.375
The real Master Roshi
would have dodged it!

04:20.459 --> 04:22.959
Why you--Nobody
could have ducked that in time!

04:23.042 --> 04:24.334
Not even me!

04:24.417 --> 04:26.375
That's 'cause
you're not Master Roshi!

04:26.459 --> 04:28.459
Now tell us who you really are!

04:28.542 --> 04:32.667
[ROSHI] Look! It's
me! I am Roshi!

04:32.750 --> 04:37.500
[CHICHI] Oh no! Papa's going
to kill me! I'm sorry.

04:38.625 --> 04:41.000
Here, I'll get it.

04:41.084 --> 04:42.375
Crazy kids!

04:46.917 --> 04:49.584
The Bansho Fan?
Yes, I have that.

04:49.667 --> 04:53.334
It's a magic fan. Wave it
once and it causes a heavy wind.

04:53.417 --> 04:55.584
The second time it's
waved a rain cloud appears.

04:55.667 --> 04:58.042
And the third
time? It rains. A lot.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.167
Perfect!

05:00.250 --> 05:02.042
[ROSHI] Now hold on!
The fan is very dangerous.

05:02.125 --> 05:04.292
[ROSHI] I'm not sure
you kids could handle it.

05:04.375 --> 05:07.250
But we have to put out
the flames on Fire Mountain!

05:07.334 --> 05:10.209
[CHICHI] They're so hot that me
and my Papa can't get back into

05:10.292 --> 05:14.292
our castle.
Please help us, Master Roshi.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.709
Well, the Bansho Fan
definitely could put

05:16.792 --> 05:21.167
out that fire. And since one
good turn deserves another...

05:21.250 --> 05:22.625
[ROSHI] Hmm... 

05:24.542 --> 05:28.125
[ROSHI] Now, let's
get this straight.

05:28.209 --> 05:31.625
I'm going to help you with the
Bansho Fan, but I'm going to

05:31.709 --> 05:34.125
need you to help me with
something, all right?

05:34.209 --> 05:35.792
[ROSHI] Remember that
other girl you were with?

05:35.875 --> 05:37.292
You mean Bulma?

05:37.375 --> 05:40.000
Yeah! I was hoping you
could convince her to

05:40.084 --> 05:43.542
pay an old man a visit. Perhaps
take a romantic moonlight stroll

05:43.625 --> 05:45.000
around the island?

05:45.459 --> 05:46.584
But Master!

05:46.667 --> 05:48.750
You know that dating
is against your code!

05:48.834 --> 05:54.084
Shhh! Shhh! And it's not a
date, it's a walk. Do-gooder...

05:54.167 --> 05:56.417
Oh, hopeless...

05:56.834 --> 05:59.667
Who asked you,
you goodie-goodie?!

05:59.750 --> 06:01.959
Besides, can't a
fragile old man near the end

06:02.042 --> 06:05.667
of his end have a
little fun before he goes?

06:06.292 --> 06:09.250
But Master, you drank
from the Fountain of Youth,

06:09.334 --> 06:12.459
so you know you're not
anywhere near your end!

06:12.542 --> 06:14.459
Why you rotten, little traitor!

06:14.542 --> 06:17.875
A walk's no big deal.
I'm sure Bulma won't mind.

06:17.959 --> 06:20.459
There, heh, you see?

06:23.709 --> 06:25.875
[ROSHI] Now listen, kid. Don't
say anything to ChiChi,

06:25.959 --> 06:27.667
'cause I don't
want her dad to know.

06:27.750 --> 06:29.667
Right. It's a secret!

06:29.750 --> 06:32.584
[GOKU] Hey ChiChi, we get
to borrow the Bansho Fan!

06:33.834 --> 06:36.042
[CHICHI] Yaay!

06:43.834 --> 06:45.250
[ROSHI] Hey, Turtle?

06:45.334 --> 06:47.334
[ROSHI] Do you remember what
I did with that blasted fan?

06:47.417 --> 06:49.084
[ROSHI] I can't find it anymore!

06:49.167 --> 06:52.500
You were using it as a place
mat the last time I saw it.

06:52.584 --> 06:53.917
A place mat?!

06:54.000 --> 06:57.292
Dear me! That
was the Bansho Fan?

06:57.375 --> 07:00.292
Oh, I spilt some juice
on it, so I threw it away

07:00.375 --> 07:02.042
'cause it was all sticky.

07:03.084 --> 07:04.917
[GOKU] No...

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Here come the tears.

07:07.084 --> 07:08.959
[wailing]

07:09.042 --> 07:10.917
We can't put out the fire!

07:11.000 --> 07:12.584
[GOKU] No Dragon Ball, either.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.042
[ROSHI] Enough!

07:14.125 --> 07:16.459
It looks like I'll just
have to go to Fire Mountain

07:16.542 --> 07:19.000
and put out those flames myself.

07:19.417 --> 07:22.084
You mean,
you can really do that?

07:22.167 --> 07:27.000
Well, of course! There's
nothing Master Roshi can't do.

07:29.084 --> 07:31.000
[ROSHI] All right. Let's go.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.959
[GOKU] Why'd you
change your clothes?

07:34.042 --> 07:35.709
Gotta look sharp.

07:35.792 --> 07:38.125
There's no telling
what the day might bring!

07:39.625 --> 07:41.250
Wait a second.

07:41.334 --> 07:44.042
You can't ride the
Flying Nimbus, can you?

07:45.459 --> 07:47.500
Don't worry about that, son.

07:47.584 --> 07:49.875
I think I can find another ride.

07:51.292 --> 07:53.875
[ROSHI] Come to me, Baby Gamela!

08:04.417 --> 08:05.959
At your service.

08:06.042 --> 08:08.084
I need to take
an express spin

08:08.167 --> 08:09.334
over to Fire Mountain.

08:09.417 --> 08:10.542
Sure!

08:10.625 --> 08:13.084
Okay, behave yourself.

08:13.167 --> 08:16.542
Hey, I don't find that
the least bit funny.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.209
Now don't forget:
promise me we'll have our

08:18.292 --> 08:20.750
little talk with Bulma
as soon as we get there.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.917
Okay, I promise.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.084
[GOKU] We'll go on ahead
and meet you there.

08:24.167 --> 08:25.292
Okay?

08:25.375 --> 08:27.792
[ROSHI] Okay, kids!
I'll be along shortly!

08:28.500 --> 08:30.334
[grunting]

08:30.750 --> 08:32.042
[CHICHI] Do you think
he can really

08:32.125 --> 08:33.958
put out Fire Mountain, Goku?

08:34.042 --> 08:37.375
[GOKU] I'll bet he can. He
said he could do anything.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.667
[ROSHI] ♪ Buffalo gals won't
ya come out tonight, ♪

08:39.750 --> 08:42.250
♪ come out tonight... ♪
I'm getting' dizzy...

08:48.667 --> 08:51.584
What?!
The Bansho Fan is ruined?!

08:51.917 --> 08:53.625
[GOKU] Yes, but it's
okay! He told us he

08:53.709 --> 08:55.459
could put the fire out himself!

08:55.542 --> 08:58.792
That's funny, kid.
You actually fell for that?

08:58.875 --> 09:00.292
I don't believe it.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.625
[GOKU] There he is now!!

09:07.417 --> 09:13.417
[gasping]

09:15.417 --> 09:22.042
[ROSHI yelling]

09:32.334 --> 09:38.875
Oh, Master Roshi!
It's really you! Ahh.

09:38.959 --> 09:42.584
Master? Are you... Are you okay?

09:45.334 --> 09:47.875
[CHICHI] I'm sorry, Papa.
He wasn't like this when

09:47.959 --> 09:49.125
we found him.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.292
[ROSHI] That's the one
drawback to riding Gamela.

09:52.375 --> 09:56.500
He makes you so darn
dizzy it's hard to adjust.

09:56.584 --> 09:59.000
Are you going to
put out the fire now?

09:59.084 --> 10:01.417
Wait! First thing's first!

10:01.500 --> 10:03.792
[ROSHI] I've heard about
you, you big, old ox,

10:03.875 --> 10:05.667
hurting people
over a silly treasure!

10:05.750 --> 10:08.750
Is that how you show respect
to the master who taught you?!

10:08.834 --> 10:12.459
[OX KING] I'm so sorry,
Master! Please forgive me!

10:12.917 --> 10:15.000
I guess I'm not worthy.

10:16.542 --> 10:19.959
And here I thought
I'd seen it all.

10:20.042 --> 10:24.125
[OX KING] I beg of you,
please forgive me Master!

10:24.209 --> 10:26.375
[ROSHI] Oh, stop your
blubbering, you big oaf!

10:26.459 --> 10:27.375
I forgive you.

10:28.667 --> 10:31.542
[ROSHI] Now, you mean to
tell me that you can't

10:31.625 --> 10:34.959
put out that fire yourself?
What's wrong, too old?

10:35.042 --> 10:37.417
[OX-KING] Oh, ha ha.
Yes, Master Roshi.

10:37.792 --> 10:40.709
Psst!
Hey, kid. The promise.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.917
Oh.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.750
[BULMA] Okay, okay. Now what's
all this hush-hush about?

10:44.834 --> 10:47.709
[ROSHI] Well, uh. I-I
can, uh, explain.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.375
[GOKU] He wants to go
on a walk with you.

10:49.459 --> 10:50.542
[BULMA] What?

10:50.625 --> 10:51.875
[ROSHI] Well, a moonlight
stroll, really.

10:51.959 --> 10:53.750
[BULMA] You mean like a date?!

10:54.917 --> 10:56.625
[ROSHI] Well,
something like that.

10:58.084 --> 11:00.709
Now listen! I don't
where you got the idea that

11:00.792 --> 11:03.042
I'd wanna go on a date
with you, but I don't!

11:03.959 --> 11:05.917
[ROSHI] I must confess,
our young friend here

11:06.000 --> 11:07.500
had something to do with it.

11:10.292 --> 11:12.000
[ROSHI] He said you'd walk
around my island with me

11:12.084 --> 11:13.959
if I put out the fire.

11:14.042 --> 11:16.584
What's the big deal?
It's just a little walk.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.375
You be quiet!

11:19.000 --> 11:21.792
[ROSHI] 'Course, I s'pose
I could just go home...

11:24.125 --> 11:25.834
Fine. A walk.

11:25.917 --> 11:28.375
But, that's as far
as it goes, mister!

11:28.459 --> 11:30.917
And don't get the wrong
idea! I'm only agreeing because

11:31.000 --> 11:33.750
I need those flames
put out! If you do that,

11:33.834 --> 11:36.084
I'll go on a walk
with you. A short one.

11:36.834 --> 11:40.167
[ROSHI] You got it! It's
a deal! Now promise!

11:41.209 --> 11:44.750
[ROSHI] Earth, water, sea air,
I declare a pinky swear!

11:45.792 --> 11:48.292
How do I get
myself into these things?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.125
[CHICHI] Hey, here they come!

11:51.209 --> 11:53.000
[OOLONG] It's about time!

11:53.084 --> 11:56.084
[ROSHI] It's time to cool
this mountain down!

11:56.167 --> 11:59.209
Sounds like he's ready
for action, doesn't it?

11:59.292 --> 12:00.750
Yeah!

12:03.417 --> 12:04.875
I gotta see this!

12:07.959 --> 12:09.959
[BULMA] I almost hope he
can't pull this thing off!

12:30.584 --> 12:32.459
[clattering]

12:45.209 --> 12:47.000
Well, here goes!

12:47.084 --> 12:49.167
[groaning]

12:52.500 --> 12:54.667
Get ready for that walk!

12:54.750 --> 12:56.084
Yeah, yeah.

12:58.959 --> 13:02.084
[ROSHI] Hey kid, could
you give me a boost?

13:03.417 --> 13:04.584
[OOLONG] Oh boy!

13:05.042 --> 13:07.625
So he can really do this, huh?

13:07.709 --> 13:09.792
Don't underestimate the Master!

13:12.542 --> 13:13.542
Okay. Ready.

13:17.959 --> 13:23.250
[grunting]

13:24.459 --> 13:26.709
[whimpering]

13:36.125 --> 13:37.459
[squealing]

13:46.292 --> 13:49.667
Now watch this! It's
the Master's Kamehameha Wave!

13:50.334 --> 13:53.084
[grunting]

13:53.167 --> 13:54.209
What's he doing?!

13:54.292 --> 13:56.834
Oh, I think we should
get out of here!

13:57.917 --> 13:59.959
[YAMCHA] Wait. I've heard
of this technique.

14:00.042 --> 14:03.375
Right now he's gathering all of
the latent energy in his body.

14:03.459 --> 14:06.125
Then he's going to
release it all at once!

14:06.209 --> 14:10.209
But I've... I've never
seen it in action before!

14:18.709 --> 14:19.667
Ka...

14:21.000 --> 14:22.334
me...

14:22.959 --> 14:23.709
ha...

14:27.959 --> 14:29.542
me....

14:31.125 --> 14:33.875
haa!

14:42.417 --> 14:47.375
[explosion]

14:50.584 --> 14:51.834
Oh, I'm pooped.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.042
Wowee.

14:55.500 --> 15:00.167
M-M-Master, look the fire,
it's out. But you kinda...

15:00.250 --> 15:01.709
Spit it out!

15:01.792 --> 15:03.959
Well, the mountain,
and my castle...

15:06.084 --> 15:08.750
[ROSHI] Hey, not
bad for an old man.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.167
[ROSHI] I'm not as
rusty as I thought...

15:10.250 --> 15:13.584
[BULMA, CHICHI, GOKU, OOLONG]
But...it's gone!

15:13.667 --> 15:15.542
Whoops. Sorry about that.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.417
[OOLONG] Just look at
this rubble heap!

15:23.500 --> 15:25.625
How on Earth are we going
to find that Dragon Ball?

15:25.709 --> 15:28.625
[BULMA] Don't worry. My trusty
radar will find it for us.

15:28.709 --> 15:31.459
I'll just adjust the
scale here. and voila!

15:31.542 --> 15:34.750
[BULMA] See, I've already
got a reading. It should be

15:34.834 --> 15:37.834
fifty yards in that
direction over there.

15:38.709 --> 15:41.209
[OX-KING] Thank you so much for
putting the fire out, Master.

15:41.292 --> 15:43.042
It feels better here already.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.000
[ROSHI] Oh, don't
thank me. I feel bad

15:45.084 --> 15:46.500
about wrecking your castle.

15:46.917 --> 15:48.667
[CHICHI] Don't feel bad,
we can always build

15:48.750 --> 15:50.167
ourselves a new one.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.500
[YAMCHA] So that little, old
man really is the great

15:52.584 --> 15:55.167
Master Roshi! Extraordinary!

15:55.250 --> 15:59.042
That was incredible!
Can you teach me how to do that?

15:59.125 --> 16:01.084
Sure, but it'll probably
take you 50 years to learn

16:01.167 --> 16:03.500
the Kamehameha Wave.

16:03.584 --> 16:05.042
Aww, Fifty years.

16:11.334 --> 16:12.542
[OOLONG] Are we there yet?

16:12.625 --> 16:14.667
[BULMA] Almost. We're
really close now.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.084
[OX-KING] Master, won't you
stay here and live with us?

16:18.167 --> 16:21.334
Thanks, but I really
do enjoy living by myself.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.625
Ka...

16:26.375 --> 16:28.500
me...ha...me...

16:30.417 --> 16:32.584
ha!

16:41.709 --> 16:45.500
Aww, but it wasn't even close
to what the Turtle Hermit did.

16:45.584 --> 16:48.709
Excellent!
Well, that's Gohan's grandson!

16:48.792 --> 16:51.042
What?
Goku is Gohan's grandson?!

16:51.125 --> 16:53.959
Yes. But I thought
you knew that already.

16:54.042 --> 16:55.917
No, I didn't.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.584
[ROSHI] Ohh, I remember Gohan
speaking of a child with a tail.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.334
[ROSHI] So that's him, huh?

17:04.375 --> 17:08.000
[ROSHI] Gohan must be
training the boy himself.

17:08.666 --> 17:11.541
So tell me, kid. How
is your Grandpa doing?

17:11.625 --> 17:14.000
Grandpa died
a long time ago.

17:14.084 --> 17:19.959
He did! Oh, I see.
I'm very sorry to hear that.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.666
Hey. I've got
a great idea.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.959
Why don't you come to
stay with me on my island

17:26.041 --> 17:27.584
and I'll train you personally!

17:27.666 --> 17:29.417
Ooh, it would be
a great honor to have

17:29.500 --> 17:31.959
the same teacher my Grandpa had!

17:32.834 --> 17:34.792
[YAMCHA] What's this?
Master Roshi doesn't

17:34.875 --> 17:37.542
take on students
easily. And there he is,

17:37.625 --> 17:39.959
asking little monkey boy.

17:40.042 --> 17:42.500
[PUAR] Maybe we should just
forget about the Dragon Balls.

17:42.584 --> 17:44.292
Hey, no wait. All
we have to do is grab that

17:44.375 --> 17:46.042
stupid little tail
of his and he'll be

17:46.125 --> 17:47.709
like putty in our hands.

17:47.792 --> 17:51.209
But what if we're not
able to get to his tail, Yamcha?

17:51.292 --> 17:54.375
Just leave that to
me and my Wolf Fang Fist.

18:01.250 --> 18:04.792
[OOLONG] This is ridiculous,
Bulma. I'm calling it quits.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.375
[BULMA] Well, it's got
to be here somewhere.

18:09.917 --> 18:10.834
I found it!

18:12.417 --> 18:16.042
[BULMA] Yeah! Check it out!
Now there's only one more to go!

18:16.125 --> 18:18.084
Fabulous!

18:18.167 --> 18:21.125
[BULMA] Woo-hoo! Yippee!

18:21.209 --> 18:23.500
[GOKU] Sounds like
Bulma found it.

18:25.209 --> 18:27.250
Hey, who did this?

18:27.334 --> 18:28.292
I did!

18:28.375 --> 18:30.667
You blew up our car,
you dummy!

18:30.750 --> 18:32.417
Please, take one of my cars.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.750
[BULMA] Oh my gosh.

18:33.834 --> 18:37.000
[OX-KING] The boy has
done so well today.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.209
I think he deserves a
little reward, don't you?

18:42.625 --> 18:45.667
Oh my. Thank you!

18:45.750 --> 18:48.542
Thanks Ox-King!
I really like it!

18:48.625 --> 18:52.667
That last ball's
pretty far... Wow.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.417
[BULMA] I'm going to have
to switch my radar over

18:54.500 --> 18:56.209
to long range.

18:58.375 --> 19:01.042
[BULMA] Ah, there it is.
All right you guys.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.292
C'mon, let's go!

19:04.667 --> 19:07.792
--Goodbye! You've been great!
--Goodbye! Thanks for the ride!

19:07.875 --> 19:10.459
[BULMA] And thank you so
much for the Dragon Ball!

19:10.542 --> 19:14.250
Hold it!! Have you
forgotten something?

19:14.334 --> 19:15.709
Your promise!

19:16.542 --> 19:20.000
Yeah, I remember.
The promise. Right.

19:21.667 --> 19:22.500
[BULMA] Oolong!

19:24.750 --> 19:26.584
[BULMA] Quiet! Listen!

19:26.667 --> 19:29.334
I promised that old goat
I'd take some stupid walk

19:29.417 --> 19:32.084
with him around his
island. Well, I just don't have

19:32.167 --> 19:34.167
the time for that. I
need you to change shape

19:34.250 --> 19:35.917
and take my place.

19:36.959 --> 19:37.959
No arguing!

19:38.042 --> 19:39.459
You do it or I'll
say the "P" word!

19:39.542 --> 19:41.334
Now you listen
here, sister!

19:41.417 --> 19:43.875
Go ahead and do your worst,
because I will not stoop

19:43.959 --> 19:47.750
that low! I do have some
semblance of dignity left.

19:47.834 --> 19:50.500
Okay, have it
your way, piggy.

19:50.584 --> 19:52.917
Alright, alright,
I'll do it!

19:54.250 --> 19:56.125
[ROSHI] ♪ Buffalo girls won't
you come out tonight. ♪ 

19:56.209 --> 19:58.417
[ROSHI] ♪ Doot doo doo... ♪

20:01.625 --> 20:02.625
How's this??

20:02.709 --> 20:05.292
That looks nothing
like me you moron!

20:05.917 --> 20:07.709
Well, excuse me.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.375
There, how's this?
You satisfied?

20:11.459 --> 20:13.875
Great! That's perfect!
Now, you just disguise your

20:13.959 --> 20:16.959
voice make sure that old geezer
doesn't know the difference!

20:17.042 --> 20:18.000
Dumb bunny.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.250
[OOLONG] Master Roshi!

20:21.250 --> 20:24.875
[OOLONG] All right. Let's
see how Bulma likes this!

20:24.959 --> 20:26.625
Now I know we only planned
on a moonlight stroll,

20:26.709 --> 20:27.667
but as long as you're
coming to the island--

20:27.750 --> 20:29.209
Master Roshi...

20:29.292 --> 20:32.000
Yes, what is it,
my sweet?

20:32.084 --> 20:36.167
You are so incredibly sexy.

20:36.250 --> 20:39.250
I just loved the way
you blew up that mountain!

20:39.334 --> 20:41.709
Well you know,
just one of the things I do.

20:41.792 --> 20:44.959
Even now, my heart's
still beating like a drum!

20:45.042 --> 20:47.125
--Boom-boom!
--Boom-boom! Boom-boom!

20:47.209 --> 20:50.917
What does that stupid
pig think he's doing?!

20:51.000 --> 20:52.625
Just look...

20:53.792 --> 20:58.375
[OOLONG] can't you tell?

20:58.459 --> 20:59.834
[ROSHI] Boom-boom!

21:01.459 --> 21:02.834
[ROSHI] Boom-boom!

21:05.584 --> 21:07.125
[ROSHI] Boom-boom!

21:07.209 --> 21:11.584
Roshi, you are truly
the luckiest man alive.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.459
[BULMA] What were you
thinking, Oolong?!

21:13.542 --> 21:16.750
I'm so mad at you right
now I could just--ooh!

21:19.667 --> 21:20.750
What's up?

21:20.834 --> 21:21.917
Oh, nothing.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.834
I was just wondering
if you're ever going

21:23.917 --> 21:26.209
to think about me again.

21:26.292 --> 21:27.959
Yeah, I think so.

21:28.042 --> 21:30.042
Oh my, you're so funny.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.792
Do you think you're
ever going to think

21:32.875 --> 21:34.709
about me again, ChiChi?

21:34.792 --> 21:36.125
Oh my gosh!

21:38.500 --> 21:40.750
--[BULMA] Bye-bye!
--[OOLONG] See you later!

21:40.834 --> 21:43.625
--Thanks again!
--We'll miss you!

21:44.375 --> 21:46.542
[GOKU] Thanks for
the Dragon Ball!

21:49.917 --> 21:52.167
Looks like it's time
to be on our way, Puar.

21:52.250 --> 21:55.584
We've got to follow those three
to the last of the Dragon Balls.

21:55.667 --> 21:56.959
Okay!

21:57.584 --> 21:58.542
[PUAR] Ready for takeoff!

22:05.417 --> 22:06.792
[BULMA] Whoa!

22:09.250 --> 22:11.875
Flying's definitely the
way to go! This is great!

22:11.959 --> 22:13.584
It's incredible!

22:16.334 --> 22:18.959
[NARRATOR] Yamcha will be
keeping a close eye on our

22:19.042 --> 22:22.042
heroes as they embark on their
journey towards the seventh,

22:22.125 --> 22:25.042
and final, Dragon
Ball. Tune in next time,

22:25.125 --> 22:27.292
