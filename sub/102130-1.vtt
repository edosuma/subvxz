this is Lindsey Cohen

02:39.985 --> 02:41.248
from the Legacy Home.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.640
I'm calling because I saw you
pulled Emmy

02:42.684 --> 02:44.468
from the waiting list.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.340
- Yes, I know.
- Look, I worked hard

02:46.383 --> 02:49.821
to get this exception, with
your circumstances and all,

02:49.865 --> 02:52.433
it's very rare that a
space opens up so quickly.

02:53.651 --> 02:54.870

changed.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.351
I had to go to Canada for a few
weeks.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.483

unfortunately once you release

02:59.527 --> 03:02.225
Emmy's spot she starts
at the bottom again.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.314
Are you sure you wanna do this?

03:04.358 --> 03:05.185

03:05.228 --> 03:06.490
It's what Sarah wanted.

I just want to say, I'm so
sorry.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.885
I got to know Sarah over the
last year.

She was quite an incredible
woman.

With everything you've been
through.

Raising a girl without her
mother can be incredibly hard.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.641
Do you have any family to help?

15:46.684 --> 15:48.121
- My parents died and

15:49.035 --> 15:51.167
Sarah's parents hate me, so,

15:52.125 --> 15:53.387
it's just me.

15:53.430 --> 15:56.520
- Listen, it's really
just a learning curve.

Emmy.

time.

I'm sorry.

16:08.532 --> 16:10.970
- Also, no cell phones.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.322
- Yeah, I still have to work.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.932
- 30 minutes a day.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.629
That's all we ask.

16:18.673 --> 16:19.979
It affects the equipment.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.243
- Fine, fine.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.548
- All right.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.550
So just some quick
family history questions.

16:26.594 --> 16:29.205
Sarah already answered but
I just need you to confirm

16:29.249 --> 16:31.425
and have you signed a release.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.296
Are you taking any medications?

16:33.340 --> 16:34.950
- Why?

16:34.994 --> 16:38.040
- Emmy can't tell us what's
going on, but genes might.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.522
- Yeah, some SSRI's for
depression

16:41.565 --> 16:44.307
and Xanax for the obvious.

16:44.351 --> 16:47.049
- Is that a situation
of depression or chronic

16:48.050 --> 16:50.357
- Situation, is this completely
necessary.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.662
- Yes, I'm sorry,

16:51.706 --> 16:53.882
but we need all the
information we can get.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.103
Do you have any history of

16:58.539 --> 17:00.019
mental illness in your family?

17:01.455 --> 17:02.282
- I don't know.

17:03.587 --> 17:07.809
I'm adopted, so I have no
idea of my family history.

17:07.852 --> 17:08.679
- Okay.

17:09.811 --> 17:13.162
Do you have any history of
alcohol abuse or any addictions?

17:13.206 --> 17:14.033
- No.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.473
- Oh, excellent.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.562
This is so excited, Emmy, isn't
it?

17:22.606 --> 17:25.696
Understand that this is an
experimental

17:25.740 --> 17:28.308
treatment completely voluntary.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.614
There's no guarantees of
results,

17:30.658 --> 17:33.400
although we've been seeing
some promising outcomes.

17:33.443 --> 17:37.491
All right, so I'm gonna have
you sign here and there,

17:37.534 --> 17:39.319
and then we'll get started.

17:39.362 --> 17:44.411
Also, Dr. Helmond uses
this touch app in tandem

17:44.454 --> 17:45.847
with the treatment.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.153
It's very simple.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.938
It might expand Emmy's
level of communication.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.593
So you just press the picture.

17:52.636 --> 17:53.637
- [Female] House.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.378
- And the app gives her voice.

- And you did the treatment
and let's happily ever after.

33:33.185 --> 33:34.708
- Not quite.

33:34.751 --> 33:39.626
I was angry at my boy, at
life, at the man who left me.

33:43.499 --> 33:45.327
I tried to drink myself to
death.

33:47.199 --> 33:48.983
- My deal is different.

33:49.027 --> 33:49.853
- Maybe.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.901
Dr. Helmond taught me
that I live in the noise

33:53.944 --> 33:55.163
in the middle.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.774
The autistic lives in the now.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.428
- Well, I like the noise.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.952
And oh, I mean, it makes life
interesting, don't you think?

34:01.996 --> 34:05.043
- All I wanted was a normal
child,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.437
a child who didn't hit
themselves.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.483
A child who didn't wake up
screaming.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.095
I wanted a child who
could be seen in public

34:14.139 --> 34:15.618
without embarrassing me.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.666
I got tired of resenting him.

34:20.928 --> 34:23.191
I felt like God had abandoned
me.

34:24.236 --> 34:27.152
And so I thought I had no
choice but to commit him.

34:29.110 --> 34:33.201
- Sandra, you know, my
expectations are pretty damn
low.

34:34.246 --> 34:37.379
I would be happy just
hearing the word daddy.

34:37.423 --> 34:40.774
- But what I'm saying is if
you can't quiet the noise,

34:40.817 --> 34:42.993
then you will never
hear that word, Richard.

34:44.473 --> 34:47.824
- So, what did you need?

34:49.783 --> 34:52.742
- Well, as part of the
treatment, we do house checks

34:52.786 --> 34:55.484
to see how our patients are
progressing.

34:55.528 --> 34:56.572
How is she doing so far?

34:56.616 --> 34:58.574
Do you notice any changes?

34:58.618 --> 34:59.836
- No, nothing really.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.621
I mean, I actually think
she's getting worse.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.144
- While the effects are
cumulative,

35:03.188 --> 35:05.146
it's only the second treatment.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.061
You might not see changes right
away.

35:08.367 --> 35:09.194
Let's see.

35:11.631 --> 35:12.458

35:14.329 --> 35:15.243

35:15.287 --> 35:16.679

35:18.203 --> 35:19.160
- [Female] Sandwich.

35:20.466 --> 35:22.772
- It's okay, it's okay.

35:22.816 --> 35:24.992
She might not get it right away.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.428
But keep trying.

35:26.472 --> 35:28.256

35:28.300 --> 35:29.649
There you go, sweetie.

35:35.176 --> 35:37.526
Do you not know how
she likes her sandwich?

35:37.570 --> 35:39.093
- No.
- She likes her sandwich

35:39.137 --> 35:41.835
with a lot of mayo, one slice of
turkey,

35:41.878 --> 35:44.490
one slice of tomato, cut in
half.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.056
- And how did you know that?

35:46.883 --> 35:48.450
- Look closer Richard.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.757
The answer is right in front of
you.

35:52.237 --> 35:55.849
- All right, I cannot spend
my entire day analyzing

35:55.892 --> 35:58.504
volumes of mayonnaise on
sandwiches, okay?

35:58.547 --> 36:00.158
- I'm not shaming you.

It's just a reality.

you and Emmy need to get

36:04.771 --> 36:05.989

- You know, honestly, I just,

36:07.948 --> 36:09.471
I don't have time for all this,
okay.

36:09.515 --> 36:12.692
Sarah is the one who spent her
entire life

36:12.735 --> 36:14.476
trying to fix Emmy, not me.

36:16.130 --> 36:19.699
- Maybe it's not about fixing
her, but accepting her.

36:20.961 --> 36:23.616
I thought I had to let my child
go,

36:23.659 --> 36:26.662
because I didn't think I had a
choice.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.186

with because once you do,

you can't get rid of it.
