(PANTING)

00:06.507 --> 00:08.372
He wasn't the wolf.

00:08.593 --> 00:09.582
It was me?

00:10.219 --> 00:12.426
Be careful! You almost
shattered my wolf thing, Billy.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.299
I'm sorry, Ruby, but look, it's fine.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.338
Tell me about this.

00:16.434 --> 00:18.095
It's the hat that pulled
your loved ones away.

00:18.561 --> 00:20.802
There ’3 magic here now.
There have to be ways to follow them.

00:21.105 --> 00:23.187
Without fairy dust to guide us,
it's hopeless.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.105
Family is everything, my dear.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.933
Charming could have been
that hope for me.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.684
But, instead, he made
my suffering worse.

00:28.779 --> 00:31.111
He must know pain, my pain.

Come on, Leroy.
We're gonna miss happy hour.

00:47.006 --> 00:49.418
Granny's running
a two-for-one special on mead.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.375
Just 'cause it's called "happy hour,"
Happy, don't mean you got to be there.

00:52.929 --> 00:54.544
We got work to do.

00:54.639 --> 00:58.223
But you're tired. We all are.
A break could help.

00:58.309 --> 01:00.140
Charming asked us to mine for dust,

01:00.436 --> 01:04.099
fairy dust, to help bring
Snow and Emma back home.

01:04.774 --> 01:10.360

what I'm gonna do!

01:42.895 --> 01:44.010
Are those...

01:44.105 --> 01:48.599
Diamonds. They're back.
The magic brought them back.

01:48.693 --> 01:50.934
You mean the kind
that become fairy dust?

01:51.028 --> 01:53.861
Indeed. We just need to refine them,
grind them up.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.731
Do you still have what remains
of Jefferson's hat?

02:00.329 --> 02:02.194
You will lock this up. Keep it safe.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.454
Because, by this time tomorrow,

02:04.542 --> 02:07.454
we'll have enough magic dust
to make it work again.

02:07.545 --> 02:09.536

02:09.672 --> 02:10.787

(CHEERS AND LAUGHTER)

02:33.779 --> 02:34.859
(LAUGHS) That was quite a spill.

-What? Where?

02:46.083 --> 02:47.539
(CHUCKLES) No.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.753
I meant me.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.420
l was a mouse. My name was Gus.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.963
I lived in Cinderella's pantry,
I ate cheese, I gnawed on wood.

02:58.054 --> 02:59.544
But I preferred the cheese.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.299
Why are you telling me this?

03:01.599 --> 03:06.263
Uh, we haven't had a chance to talk
since things changed.

03:07.104 --> 03:10.096
ljust wanted you to know
who I was back home.

03:10.775 --> 03:13.767
Uh, can I, um, still call you Billy?

03:13.861 --> 03:16.147
You can call me whatever you want,

03:16.238 --> 03:18.399
as long as you let me
buy you a drink after your shift.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.821
I already know Ruby.
I want the chance to meet Red.

03:25.456 --> 03:28.289
Um, tonight's actually not great.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.832
(SIGHS) Because...

03:29.919 --> 03:32.956
Uh, we, uh, we have plans.

03:33.798 --> 03:37.131
That's right. Um, it's girls' night.
I'm bringing the cheese.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.004
Which has nothing to do
with you being a mouse.

03:39.095 --> 03:41.632
It has to do with the wine.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.885
Okay. Um, maybe next time.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.397
(SIGHS) Thank you.

(STAMMERING) It's complicated.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.155
Is that coffee?

04:05.830 --> 04:06.990
No.

04:10.126 --> 04:11.787
Trying to stay up, huh?

04:13.504 --> 04:15.369
Still worried about those nightmares?

04:16.841 --> 04:18.081
Well, don't be.

04:18.175 --> 04:22.009
'Cause when you go to sleep tonight,
I'm gonna be right in the next room.

Quite a celebration.

04:45.536 --> 04:49.370
You may have taken care of me
in the old world, but in this one?

04:49.457 --> 04:50.867
We get another go at each other.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.073
Whenever you're ready.

04:53.377 --> 04:57.746
It's a big moment for you, isn't it?
On your way to getting your family back.

04:58.090 --> 05:03.050
Yeah. Yeah, it must be hard for you.
You know, watching good win.

05:03.179 --> 05:05.921
(LAUGHS) "Good"? So sure of yourself.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.464
But I know the truth.

05:08.559 --> 05:11.175
You're still just a shepherd
pretending to be a prince.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.680
You weren't fit to run the kingdom

05:12.771 --> 05:14.853
and you sure as hell
aren't fit to run this town.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.556
Well, I think the people of Storybrooke
might disagree with you.

05:18.527 --> 05:22.111
Today. But I'm gonna see to it
that they see things my way.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.070
That they see you for who you really are.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.407
By the time I'm done with you,

05:27.495 --> 05:29.736
you'll wish you'd killed me
when you had the chance.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.749
The people of this town
know who I really am.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.115
And they've seen me defeat you before.

05:36.170 --> 05:40.789
So if you wanna try and take me down,
they'll see it again.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.353
Almost done.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.105
Let's finish clearing out
those perishables.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.311
What the hell is this?

06:03.572 --> 06:04.778
We're making a cage.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.857
You know anybody who might want
38 frozen lasagnas?

06:07.993 --> 06:09.073
I'm sorry, what?

06:09.161 --> 06:11.618
I know. Nobody would believe it
if you told them my lasagna was frozen.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.412
No. Why are you building a cage?

06:14.500 --> 06:17.242
Tonight's the first full moon
since the curse broke.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.621
It's the first night of Wolfstime.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.795
I thought you'd figured out
how to control the wolf in you ages ago.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.124
Yeah, but, thanks to the curse,
I haven't turned in 28 years.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.970
I might be rusty.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.295
I can't let what happened last time,

06:29.390 --> 06:31.301
what happened to Peter,
happen to anyone else.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.348
What about your red hood?
That could keep you from turning.

06:33.435 --> 06:36.598
If I had it. I've looked everywhere,
I even went to Gold.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.346
It's not in town.
I don't think it came over with the curse.

Snow trusted you.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.771

you won't hurt anyone tonight.

There's a full moon tonight.

takes over me, I can't control it.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.668
Please, Snow, find shelter.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.421
I'll go further into the woods
and find a place to hide.

so you never have to be afraid
of what you might do again?

14:04.428 --> 14:05.884
Is that possible?

14:06.430 --> 14:07.419
Follow me.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.730
Is this some kind of trick?

14:42.049 --> 14:45.883
It used to be the grand hall of a castle,
until it sunk underground.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.672
Now, it's all ours.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.639
Are they...

14:56.813 --> 14:59.520
Yes. We are all the same.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.435
Come. Anita's expecting you.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.233
Who's Anita?

15:08.325 --> 15:09.314
WOMAN: That would be me.

15:16.958 --> 15:20.667
Well done, Quinn. You finally found her.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.379
You've grown so much.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.583
You know me?

15:27.719 --> 15:29.095
(CHUCKLES)

15:29.179 --> 15:30.464
I'm your mother.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.525
That's Billy's truck.

15:44.194 --> 15:47.686
Great. Who do I call to tow a tow truck?

15:51.034 --> 15:52.535
What is it, Ruby? What's wrong?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.701
I smell blood.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.620
(SIGHS)

16:03.213 --> 16:04.703
-Where's Billy?
-GRAN NY: Here.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.752
(RUBY SCREAMING)

16:16.309 --> 16:17.810
It was the wolf!

16:19.396 --> 16:21.102
(CRYING) It was me!

16:26.653 --> 16:29.395
Oh, yes. You were quite right to call me.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.277
So, you can help? It was just a dream?

16:33.368 --> 16:36.326
Well, what you're describing
is certainly not a dream.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.493
Then what was it?

16:37.664 --> 16:38.744
A side effect.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.491
You know, it's remarkable you'd cast
a curse you know so little about.

16:42.586 --> 16:45.077
My victims are not supposed to wake up.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.376
So I certainly never cared
what happened to them after.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.673
Until now.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.464
GOLD: When people fall
under a sleeping curse,

16:53.597 --> 16:56.430
the soul travels to a nethen/vorld,

16:56.516 --> 16:58.802
where it resides until awoken.

17:00.270 --> 17:03.433
Now, this world
is between life and death.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.564
And it's very real.

17:08.069 --> 17:11.857
However, even when
the curse is broken,

17:12.782 --> 17:15.319
sometimes, in sleep,

17:16.036 --> 17:18.994
the victims find their way
back to that world.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.779
Victims like you.

17:22.167 --> 17:26.831
This other world is tormenting my son
every time he sleeps.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.167
I want you to give him something
that will keep him from going there.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.214
Well, I'm afraid that's not possible.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.131
I can, however,
provide you with something

17:35.222 --> 17:39.431
that will allow him to control his actions
whilst in that world.

17:40.143 --> 17:44.637
And once one controls something,
one no longer need fear it.

17:46.524 --> 17:47.730
A necklace?

17:47.901 --> 17:50.358
You wear this while you're sleeping.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.858
Once you control the journey,
the fear will stop.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.982
And then, you can come and go
as you please.

18:00.247 --> 18:04.160
Everything comes at a price with you.
What do you want for this?

18:04.709 --> 18:08.167
For a house call? You couldn't afford it.

18:10.006 --> 18:13.248
But this is for Henry. This one's on me.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.094
DAVID: It had to be
something else, Ruby.

18:22.185 --> 18:25.598
No, I did this. We both know it.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.225
No. A few months ago,

18:27.315 --> 18:29.226
everyone thought
Mary Margaret was guilty of murder.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.853
She needed someone to believe in her,
I didn't do that.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.106
I am not gonna make
the same mistake with you.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.360
Mary Margaret never killed anyone.
Ihave.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.441
I know who you really are, Ruby,

18:40.745 --> 18:43.031
even if you've lost sight of it.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.701
It doesn't change the fact
that I'm gonna turn again tonight.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.532
And somebody else could get hurt.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.458
Maybe this isn't the place
to have this discussion.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.785
It's okay. I'll protect her.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.667
No! Lock me up.

18:54.217 --> 18:57.050
If the freezer couldn't hold me,
maybe a jail cell will.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.423
I don't need to be protected
from other people, David.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.846
Other people need to
be protected from me.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.343
(SNIFFLES)

19:05.603 --> 19:07.059
Granny lied to me.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.731
That story about you
being killed by hunters.

19:12.736 --> 19:15.523
She's been lying to you
ever since she stole you away from me

19:15.613 --> 19:17.069
when you were just a baby.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.906
Why would she do that?

19:20.618 --> 19:24.406
Because she didn't want you to find out
the truth about who you really are.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.907
She believed the wolf
is something to be ashamed of.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.124
I see things differently.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.799
Humans want us to believe
we are the monsters.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.884
The moment you believe them,
that's when you become one.

19:46.394 --> 19:50.353
You're not the first to learn the truth
about yourself through tragedy.

19:51.024 --> 19:54.266
So many of us spend so much of our life
suppressing the wolf.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.476
They have no idea how to control it.

19:56.571 --> 19:57.777
(EXHALES)

19:58.531 --> 19:59.941
Theyjust need help.

20:01.368 --> 20:04.280
Help embracing their true nature.

20:06.414 --> 20:09.030
The only way
you will ever control the wolf

20:10.251 --> 20:12.742
is by accepting it as a part of you.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.126
You can teach me to do that?

20:19.469 --> 20:21.175
Indeed,|can.

20:23.848 --> 20:24.883
How?

20:26.059 --> 20:28.801
You can start by getting rid of that.

21:00.718 --> 21:03.255
DAVID: You'll be safe in here tonight.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.046
Thank you, David.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.553
Thank me in the morning.

21:08.643 --> 21:11.180
By then, I'll have found
whoever really killed Billy.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.519
GEORGE: You already have.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.562
It's that thing. That she-wolf.

(SLAMS DRAWER) Get out!

21:20.113 --> 21:22.195
Whatever issues you have with me
don't involve her.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.648
There's no proof Ruby had anything
to do with what happened.

21:24.742 --> 21:27.654
It seems to me
that you're allowing your emotions

21:27.745 --> 21:28.871
to cloud yourjudgment.

21:29.914 --> 21:30.994
Leave him alone.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.915
Protecting your friend
at the peril of everyone else.

21:38.548 --> 21:39.503
What do you want?

21:39.591 --> 21:44.381
Justice. Hand her over to me
and let the town decide her fate.

21:44.512 --> 21:47.675
Never. I know exactly what kind of
justice you have in mind.

21:48.349 --> 21:49.964
GEORGE: This town is bigger
than you think.

21:50.393 --> 21:53.100
I start telling people that
you're putting their lives in danger

21:53.188 --> 21:55.474
to protect your own interests,
you'll have a mutiny on your hands.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.600
Yeah, we'll see.

21:58.943 --> 22:02.106
You want her?
You have to go through me.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.781
I look fon/vard to that.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.304
Your mind won ’t want to believe it.

22:34.771 --> 22:37.387
It will tell you a wolf
is invading your body,

22:37.482 --> 22:38.767
trying to take over.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.108
And if you believe that,
for even a moment,

22:42.195 --> 22:45.232
you’ll black out and lose control.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.778

every other night you’ve turned.
