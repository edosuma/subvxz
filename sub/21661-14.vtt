01:00.685 --> 01:03.521
MARCH 2, 2017

01:30.381 --> 01:32.342
-It's cold outside. Be careful.
-Okay.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.554
Mr. Han.

01:37.013 --> 01:37.847
Yes?

01:41.100 --> 01:42.685
And your name is?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.689
My name?

01:48.733 --> 01:52.112
I'm sorry.
I'm bad at remembering people's faces.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.074
Yes, well... I'm...

01:56.157 --> 01:56.991
Mr. Han!

01:57.784 --> 02:00.453
I'm so sorry, but I need to go now.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.038
Sorry.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.625
Look. Please leave me
your contact information.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.210
I'm sorry.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.088
-I'll see you later.
-Be careful.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.636
It would have been better
if you had called first.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.471
What's your name?

02:25.562 --> 02:29.399
Hyo-jin Moon

02:52.463 --> 02:56.843
FINALE
THEIR MIRRORS #SoLongSeeYouTomorrow

02:58.344 --> 02:59.429
It's been so long.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.931
-Right?
-How long has it been?

03:02.682 --> 03:04.267
You look good.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.103
Let's meet up more often.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.022
-It's nice to see everyone.
-It is.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.358
Thank you for making time
in your busy schedules

03:12.442 --> 03:14.527
to come and join us today.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.447
Now, we will begin
the appreciation banquet to celebrate

03:17.530 --> 03:21.409
Mr. Gwan-young Han's 38th year
in teaching.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.540
Please come out, sir!

03:31.252 --> 03:32.462
We love you!

03:33.463 --> 03:35.006
You look so handsome!

03:37.175 --> 03:38.468
You look great!

03:42.722 --> 03:44.349
JI-WON SONG

03:50.438 --> 03:52.690
-Congratulations, Grandpa.
-Thanks.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.651
We will now give him the plaque

03:54.734 --> 03:56.736
his students prepared
to show our appreciation.

03:56.819 --> 04:00.240
Mr. Han's best friend
and the director of this gallery,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.575
Mr. Hyun-chul Jung, will do the honors.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.536
"We were happy
to share the time with you."

04:11.209 --> 04:14.420
-Thank you, Mr. Gwan-young Han!
-Thank you, Mr. Gwan-young Han!

04:15.880 --> 04:19.050
Next, let us hear a few words
from our guest of honor,

04:19.384 --> 04:20.927
Mr. Gwan-young Han.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.978
This is why
I didn't want to have a banquet.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.521
No, sir.

04:31.688 --> 04:35.149
I'm a terrible public speaker,
but you keep making me talk.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.192
You can do this!

04:36.442 --> 04:39.487
I first started to draw

04:39.988 --> 04:41.489
when I was a child.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.700
I think I started during grade school.

04:44.200 --> 04:48.246
Actually, I started
before I entered school,

04:48.663 --> 04:51.708
so I guess
I was about six years old or so.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.045
While the other kids were wrestling,
playing with toy guns,

04:56.129 --> 04:57.839
and running around everywhere,

04:58.423 --> 05:01.301
I would spend my time
drawing on the ground

05:01.426 --> 05:03.344
with a branch or something.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.762
Then my sister said,

05:04.846 --> 05:08.266
"Gwan-young, you're good at drawing."

05:08.641 --> 05:11.477
That's when I thought,
"Oh, so I'm good at drawing?"

05:14.897 --> 05:17.275
I'm embarrassed to say this,

05:18.067 --> 05:20.194
but I didn't become a teacher

05:20.278 --> 05:23.573
because I had a special philosophy
or passion for teaching.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.618
But among my students are assemblymen,

05:28.369 --> 05:29.871
professors, and whatnot,

05:30.246 --> 05:33.666
so I think I was more talented in teaching

05:34.125 --> 05:36.711
than I was in drawing.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.925
Anyway, I would like
to thank you all today.

05:43.718 --> 05:47.180
I wouldn't be here today
if it weren't for all of you.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.684
A teacher is only valued
if he has successful students.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.064
Thank you all for coming today

05:56.647 --> 05:58.357
and for giving your time.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.992
Okay, next up. Professor Heon-kyung Park.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.453
He will speak on behalf of the students.

06:13.372 --> 06:16.626
I agree with one thing
that Mr. Han had said.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.630
Mr. Han didn't seem to realize
that he was a teacher.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.635
I remember the best compliment
he gave me back then.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.179
He said, "I envy you."

06:28.846 --> 06:30.807
What teacher envies his student?

06:32.058 --> 06:35.144
Please keep envying me, sir.
And please stay healthy.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.438
And next...

06:45.363 --> 06:48.324
It was such an honor to learn from you.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.576
Thank you, Mr. Han.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.041
Okay, thank you.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.544
We'll end up doing this all night.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.295
Let's move on. Next up is...

07:10.638 --> 07:12.974
There is something I really want to say.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.393
Well...

07:18.312 --> 07:19.564
Please.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.320
Sure.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.032
Well...

07:35.037 --> 07:37.039
I was in the third grade.

07:38.499 --> 07:39.917
It was the summer.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.670
All the classes were over.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.798
My friend and I were playing
in the schoolyard.

08:06.861 --> 08:07.862
Kids.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.866
Mr. Han said...

08:12.450 --> 08:16.245
Can one of you help me a little?

08:21.667 --> 08:24.712
I wanted to say, "I will."

08:25.463 --> 08:26.547
But...

08:28.466 --> 08:30.009
I was too shy.

08:32.803 --> 08:37.058
So, I waited without saying anything,
hoping he would say, "You."

08:43.814 --> 08:44.649
You.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.697
I...

08:53.115 --> 08:55.201
was jealous of my friend.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.664
I was so jealous that I even hated
her at that moment.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.878
A little later...

09:05.962 --> 09:07.171
Run and hide!

09:07.255 --> 09:09.465
The other students arrived.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.302
One, two, three, four,

09:13.761 --> 09:18.724
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

09:18.808 --> 09:19.725
Here I come!

09:20.601 --> 09:21.686
Where are you?

09:22.603 --> 09:23.604
Where are you?

09:24.146 --> 09:25.106
Come here.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.108
I'm sorry.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.542
Come here.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.669
Please let me go.

09:48.838 --> 09:49.880
I'm sorry.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.340
Come here.

09:55.303 --> 09:58.014
Come here. Let's go.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.325
Okay, next up...

10:17.408 --> 10:19.118
That day, Mr. Han...

10:22.121 --> 10:24.206
Do you know what he did next...

10:28.210 --> 10:29.211
in the art room,

10:30.087 --> 10:33.591
or what that child suffered after that?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.511
Do you even know who that child was?

10:40.681 --> 10:43.434
Hyo-jin Moon. It was Hyo-jin Moon.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.436
Please stop and sit down.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.438
I don't know what you're saying.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.398
Goodness.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.278
I don't know what other people may think,

10:54.403 --> 10:57.865
but this is a very special event for me,
and a big honor.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.076
Why are you...

11:01.077 --> 11:02.787
Why are you doing this to me?

11:04.789 --> 11:06.123
Please, Mr. Han.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.836
Please admit what you did

11:12.254 --> 11:13.422
and apologize.

11:18.719 --> 11:19.678
I... I'm sorry.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.973
You know, she came a while ago

11:23.557 --> 11:26.852
and said she was my student
and said some strange things.

11:27.228 --> 11:31.690
Either there is a misunderstanding
or perhaps she's not well.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.653
I saw it! I saw it myself!

11:36.362 --> 11:39.365
I saw what you did in the art room.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.951
I saw it. And...

11:53.671 --> 11:54.547
Bye.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.883
-Come visit during vacation.
-See you again.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.640
You aren't wearing them today.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.727
The pretty shoes.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.524
I...

12:15.734 --> 12:16.569
I...

12:17.778 --> 12:18.946
I saw it.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.993
I saw it.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.413
Hyo-jin knew that I saw!

12:32.209 --> 12:35.504
I don't believe your lies.
Do you know why?

12:40.176 --> 12:41.886
Because I know my father.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.096
No one here believes you. Do you know why?

12:45.222 --> 12:47.558
Because everyone here knows my father.

12:51.145 --> 12:55.691
I'm sorry. Someone please call the police.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.110
Someone please call the police.

13:04.742 --> 13:05.743
CASE REPORT

13:05.826 --> 13:07.203
Any witnesses or evidence?

13:13.167 --> 13:15.711
So, your memories
from 13 years ago are all you have?

13:21.884 --> 13:23.177
He lied.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.638
On March 2 of this year,

13:26.055 --> 13:30.935
Hyo-jin went to see Mr. Han. But he said
he didn't know who Hyo-jin was.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.019
Why?

13:32.853 --> 13:34.480
Because he has something to hide.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.691
Mr. Han wasn't home that day.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.193
His daughter confirmed it.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.402
They're lying.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.655
Hyo-jin went to that house.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.157
How does that prove sexual assault?

13:47.535 --> 13:49.161
What about her putting down my name?

13:50.246 --> 13:54.250
She put down my name and address
to invite me to the banquet.

13:54.917 --> 13:55.918
Why?

13:58.045 --> 14:00.631
She wanted to call me there,
the only witness.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.055
Hyo-jin

14:09.306 --> 14:11.517
died right after she went to see him.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.728
She died the very next day. Why?

14:14.812 --> 14:16.313
I heard she was depressed.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.568
You're a reporter for the school paper.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.946
You should know how it looks
from what we have so far.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.336
-Here.
-Here?

14:40.880 --> 14:44.008
Yes, I understand. Okay.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.599
Mr. Gwan-young Han just called.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.476
He apparently looked you up.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.980
Did you get psychiatric treatment?

14:59.565 --> 15:00.566
Excuse me?

15:00.649 --> 15:03.485
You were treated for insomnia, anxiety,
and mythomania.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.282
That was...

15:10.534 --> 15:12.953
That was a long, long time ago,
when I was in grade school.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.539
He says that if you promise

15:16.040 --> 15:18.834
to get therapy again and apologize
officially, he won't press charges.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.963
Look. I'm not taking his side.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.924
I'm not doing this
because I don't want to work.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.010
It's because it's a waste.
It would be a waste of your life.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.346
You're a student reporter
at a top university.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.349
You should get a job as a reporter
and write news articles.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.726
You can't if you have a criminal record.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.146
-Ji-won!
-Ji-won!

15:41.732 --> 15:42.858
What happened?

15:43.067 --> 15:46.445
Why did you all come?
I only needed one person.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.238
Who...

15:49.531 --> 15:50.824
We're her housemates.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.829
Talk to her. You should stop her
from going to jail at her age.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.249
Ji-won.

16:04.755 --> 16:05.965
Is there anywhere to sit?

16:08.634 --> 16:09.468
I guess not.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.055
-Do you want to sit?
-It's okay. Sit down.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.855
What did you take to come here?

16:23.148 --> 16:24.149
A taxi.

16:25.275 --> 16:28.153
The taxi fare must have been
very expensive.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.949
-It was 40,000...
-That doesn't matter now.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.830
So? Did you talk to her?

16:51.802 --> 16:52.886
I'm sorry.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.349
Good. I'm glad...

16:57.433 --> 16:58.684
I won't apologize.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.526
I can't apologize.

17:12.072 --> 17:12.906
I...

17:14.074 --> 17:16.702
I don't know what I did wrong.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.372
How can I apologize?

17:26.128 --> 17:28.255
Do you think he'll really press charges?

17:28.881 --> 17:29.798
Yes.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.717
I heard that with slander,

17:32.134 --> 17:34.762
you're guilty even if you tell the truth.

17:35.512 --> 17:36.638
That's right.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.931
That's ridiculous.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.225
Then will you really go to jail?

17:41.143 --> 17:42.144
Aren't I incredible?

17:42.478 --> 17:44.980
I'm the first person you know
who was charged with a crime, right?

17:45.439 --> 17:46.690
This is how I roll.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.406
Hey, why you...

17:56.325 --> 17:57.242
Why you...

17:57.910 --> 17:59.411
You should have told me...

17:59.495 --> 18:00.871
You would have stopped me.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.291
Get in.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.835
How many people can fit in your car?

18:11.256 --> 18:12.549
-Hello.
-Hello.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.277
Ji-won, seriously...

18:32.903 --> 18:34.696
How could she sleep right now?

18:35.739 --> 18:38.534
I know. She's sleeping so peacefully.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.495
She hasn't been able to sleep lately.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.883
You should have gone in his car
if you were so tired.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.426
How could I?

19:02.724 --> 19:04.726
Who was that guy?

19:05.477 --> 19:07.980
Sung-min? A friend from the school paper.

19:08.772 --> 19:11.358
He's the guy from before, right?

19:11.650 --> 19:12.484
Yes.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.570
Is he just a friend?

19:17.573 --> 19:19.158
He isn't just a friend.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.205
He's my friend

19:26.039 --> 19:27.082
and underling.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.209
What the heck?

19:29.793 --> 19:31.044
Be honest.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.631
An underling can become a boyfriend
and then a husband.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.094
-I like him.
-I approve.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.639
Gwan-young Han

19:42.723 --> 19:46.935
Chiefs of administration:
Mi-young Ahn, Seung-il Jung, Jae-won Kim

19:47.019 --> 19:50.272
Yado Elementary School
Nangsum Elementary School

19:50.355 --> 19:52.733
Ganae Elementary School in Gwangcheon

19:52.816 --> 19:55.068
Hyo-jin Moon, Ji-won Song

19:55.152 --> 19:56.945
Transferred to Okcheon.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.531
Year 2013. December...

19:59.615 --> 20:03.285
Yes. I'm looking for someone
who attended Shinki Elementary School...

20:03.368 --> 20:05.204
Then Nangsum Elementary...

20:05.287 --> 20:07.372
-Yes, okay.
-Just a minute.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.750
-Chungju...
-Just a minute.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.711
Yes, go ahead.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.716
Yes. Alright. Thank you.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.767
How may we help you?

20:28.560 --> 20:29.519
Ji-won Song...

20:30.229 --> 20:31.897
I came to help Ji-won...

20:32.439 --> 20:33.815
Here.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.114
You didn't have to.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.783
I wanted to thank you.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.077
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.996
-Thank you.
-Please come this way.

20:48.705 --> 20:49.539
Okay.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.459
This way.

20:55.545 --> 20:56.463
Have a seat.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.344
Where is Ji-won?

21:02.761 --> 21:05.222
She just left to meet with her attorney.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.268
What should I do to help?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.520
You just have to write about Ji-won.

21:11.812 --> 21:15.691
About how this Hyo-jin Moon incident
affected her.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.026
So, for example,

21:18.360 --> 21:21.196
-I heard she said she saw ghosts.
-Yes.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.657
That could have been more than just lies.

21:23.740 --> 21:26.118
It might have been
her suppressed memories of Hyo-jin.

21:26.785 --> 21:30.038
If we backtrack,
we can see that she started lying

21:30.122 --> 21:32.124
after seeing what she saw in the art room.

21:34.626 --> 21:38.338
I heard you were with her
when she got her memory back, Eun-jae.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.758
Please write what happened then.
Make it simple and easy to understand.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.385
It will be submitted to the court.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.764
How do you know my name?

21:51.977 --> 21:53.562
We went on a blind date together.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.650
I'm so sorry.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.737
I wasn't myself back then.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.119
Well...

22:10.704 --> 22:11.997
I'm Choong-hwan Cho.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.042
Hello.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.294
HJ LAW FIRM

22:17.377 --> 22:18.462
CASE STUDY ON SEXUAL ASSAULT

22:23.633 --> 22:24.968
I looked through the documents.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.890
To be honest, the odds are against you.

22:31.058 --> 22:31.892
I see.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.352
The sexual assault victim already died,

22:35.187 --> 22:36.855
and you're the only witness.

22:36.938 --> 22:40.942
They'll probably use your past
medical history against you.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.154
That was because I was traumatized
by what I witnessed...

22:44.237 --> 22:45.113
I know.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.740
What I want to confirm is

22:47.365 --> 22:49.326
whether you can fight until the end.

22:51.078 --> 22:51.912
I can.

22:52.662 --> 22:53.497
Okay.

22:53.580 --> 22:57.542
Then the first thing we must do
is to go public.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.670
The surefire way is to report it
through the media.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.968
Will you be okay if this goes public?

23:11.932 --> 23:14.226
You know what happens
when things like this get publicized.

23:16.978 --> 23:19.439
I know.
People will say bad things about me.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.066
Not just me,

23:21.441 --> 23:23.652
but my family and friends as well.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.739
It might hurt you, too.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.329
To be honest,

23:36.123 --> 23:37.374
I'm terrified.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.544
You said you were confident.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.838
How could I say I wasn't
in front of the lawyer?

23:50.637 --> 23:51.680
Those shoes...

23:52.764 --> 23:53.849
Those pretty shoes.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.894
I wore them for the first time that day.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.606
And I never wore them again
because I was afraid.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.319
I felt like what happened that day

24:07.988 --> 24:09.990
could have happened to me,

24:11.241 --> 24:12.409
so I never wore them again.

24:36.057 --> 24:38.643
-A bug spray?
-Yes, a mosquito repellent.

24:38.727 --> 24:42.105
Bug spray, sunscreen, arm warmers.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.940
They usually send stuff like that.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.692
Don't they provide them?

24:45.775 --> 24:47.694
I'm sure they do. But still.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.947
My friends all sent them that stuff.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.241
What else?

24:54.951 --> 24:56.995
Don't people usually do something special?

24:57.078 --> 24:59.372
Like taking a trip
before he goes into the army.

25:00.957 --> 25:01.833
A trip?

25:04.920 --> 25:07.130
You haven't gotten that far, right?

25:09.549 --> 25:11.551
What about kissing? Did you kiss yet?

25:16.139 --> 25:19.601
That's strange.
Most people kiss by this time.

25:23.438 --> 25:27.317
Don't compare yourself to others.
It's not like there is a formula for that.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.612
"After dating one month, you kiss.
After a year, do something else.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.656
And if you stray from it,
you're doing it wrong."

25:33.240 --> 25:34.449
That's nonsense.

25:35.075 --> 25:39.162
I know so much now.
Why was I like that back then?

25:39.704 --> 25:42.290
I feel like I can do much better
if I date again.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.167
See you later.

25:47.504 --> 25:48.463
Hi.

25:48.546 --> 25:49.714
-Welcome home.
-Hey.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.842
What are you up to?

25:55.553 --> 25:56.805
The character witness testimony?

25:57.389 --> 26:00.100
You aren't being completely honest
with what you're writing, are you?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.352
Make it interesting. Make me sound good.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.648
You saw Choong-hwan today, right?

26:07.941 --> 26:10.151
Choong-hwan Cho? Yes.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.404
He said you changed a lot.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.198
He said you seemed completely different
from the blind date.

26:15.782 --> 26:17.492
He seemed very interested.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.371
-Should I set something up?
-What?

26:23.415 --> 26:25.250
Date him. He's a nice guy.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.377
I don't think I can.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.130
Why not? You aren't over him yet?

26:31.464 --> 26:32.507
No.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.761
You get over a guy with another guy.

26:37.345 --> 26:40.181
It's weird trying so hard
to forget him though.

26:41.224 --> 26:45.145
I'm sure I'll forget him eventually,
even if I don't.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.605
Hey. Don't give up
after one failed relationship.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.734
That's no fun. You should try some more.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.035
When do you shave off your hair?

27:01.411 --> 27:03.371
I don't know, but I have to at some point.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.624
Should I do it for you?
I'll shave it all off like a monk.

27:06.791 --> 27:07.751
Forget it.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.086
Why? I'm a hairdresser's daughter.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.845
Look at those high schoolers.
They must be skipping night class.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.431
They should be studying.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.308
Seriously.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.812
I was really good looking
when I was in high school.

27:36.237 --> 27:37.072
Excuse me.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.506
What?

27:57.717 --> 27:59.761
-What?
-I don't want to talk to you.

28:00.470 --> 28:01.471
Why not?

28:02.013 --> 28:03.848
I don't want to say. It hurts my pride.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.393
Why? What is it?

28:09.729 --> 28:12.982
Why won't you touch me?

28:14.651 --> 28:16.528
Because I'm not like a girl?

28:17.278 --> 28:20.740
No. You're a girl.
You're totally a girl to me.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.118
Then why?

28:25.495 --> 28:27.038
I told you the other day.

28:27.664 --> 28:28.790
What?

28:30.750 --> 28:33.461
Being physical before joining the army...

28:34.504 --> 28:36.339
I'll feel like I would be pushing you.

28:37.590 --> 28:39.467
You might regret it later, too.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.178
Why are you worried about my regrets?

28:42.721 --> 28:44.305
What's the big deal about the army?

28:45.348 --> 28:47.100
You can make phone calls
from the army, now.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.852
And people can visit every weekend.

28:48.977 --> 28:52.981
You don't know
how a guy going to the army feels.

28:56.484 --> 28:57.569
You don't want to go?

28:59.446 --> 29:02.741
Who wants to go?
They go because they have to.

29:02.907 --> 29:03.742
Are you depressed?

29:05.326 --> 29:06.453
I can't even sleep.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.881
I didn't want to show you

29:19.340 --> 29:21.843
My awkwardly short new haircut

29:21.968 --> 29:22.802
Hey.

29:23.261 --> 29:26.514
I don't want to leave you

29:26.598 --> 29:27.474
Stop it.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.643
In the sea of people waving

29:30.727 --> 29:31.770
I told you to stop.

29:31.853 --> 29:34.522
Will you forget me

29:34.606 --> 29:35.690
I said to stop.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.286
In those three years

29:49.746 --> 29:53.249
When I told you not to wait for me

29:54.083 --> 29:56.961
It was because I felt bad

30:46.719 --> 30:48.054
Jin-myung!

30:49.889 --> 30:51.766
Hey. Guys, it's Jin-myung.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.226
-Hello.
-Hello.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.688
We got our costumes. Don't we look great?

30:58.022 --> 30:59.107
Wow.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.109
It's tomorrow already.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.697
But why won't you tell us
where we're performing?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.533
Well... The thing is...

31:10.451 --> 31:11.494
It's a surprise?

31:13.830 --> 31:14.914
Seriously...

31:15.707 --> 31:18.334
You might make me cry
if you keep doing this.

31:18.793 --> 31:19.627
Me too.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.756
We talked about it,
and we're dedicating this song to you.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.387
Don't do that.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.517
-Hi, Jin-myung.
-Hey.

31:37.854 --> 31:40.982
-Is Ji-won back?
-Yes, she's in her room.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.612
Your stomach hurts again?

31:46.362 --> 31:47.196
Yes.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.992
-You should get it checked.
-Yes.

31:54.954 --> 31:58.249
You don't need the other person's consent
when you record a conversation,

31:58.583 --> 32:00.251
as long as you're a participant.

32:01.544 --> 32:02.378
Yes.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.589
I don't know about that.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.175
I'll ask the lawyer.

32:07.800 --> 32:08.676
Okay.

32:09.636 --> 32:10.678
Thanks.

32:12.847 --> 32:13.806
You must be tired.

32:14.390 --> 32:15.558
Yes, I am.

32:16.225 --> 32:19.479
Don't let anyone press charges
against you, okay?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.027
You have something to say?

32:31.240 --> 32:32.325
Well...

32:32.951 --> 32:35.203
That thing I asked you. How did it go?

32:35.828 --> 32:37.413
About Heimdallr's farewell stage.

32:39.874 --> 32:40.708
Right...

32:41.918 --> 32:43.294
-Hold on.
-Sure.

32:44.253 --> 32:45.380
Mom?

32:46.172 --> 32:47.298
Are you crying?

32:48.383 --> 32:50.843
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

32:53.388 --> 32:56.099
-Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
-Okay.

32:56.182 --> 32:58.935
Mom. It's not like that.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.437
Who said something to you?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.107
That's ridiculous.

33:04.565 --> 33:07.443
Mr. Tae-kwon said that? I won't die, okay?

33:11.656 --> 33:13.116
It's a karaoke bar!

33:17.036 --> 33:18.162
A karaoke bar?

33:19.497 --> 33:20.707
Oh, a karaoke bar.

33:21.874 --> 33:24.210
-I knew it.
-Are you kidding me?

33:27.380 --> 33:31.384
Right? We're only good enough
for a karaoke bar.

33:32.301 --> 33:33.136
It's okay.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.230
Mom?

33:52.822 --> 33:54.490
Are you all right?

33:58.369 --> 33:59.203
Ji-won!

34:02.415 --> 34:04.917
She left early this morning.

34:09.255 --> 34:10.423
Isn't it today?

34:12.383 --> 34:15.261
-Yes.
-How could you not know yet?

34:16.763 --> 34:18.514
I asked, but she said

34:19.098 --> 34:20.558
she would take care of it.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.102
Still, you should have checked.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.855
But Ji-won

34:26.481 --> 34:28.858
seemed really busy with her stuff, too.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.110
I felt bad bothering her.

34:31.194 --> 34:34.238
Still, you should ask what you need to.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.116
You're surprisingly frustrating.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.618
Yes. It's so stupid.

34:44.874 --> 34:47.376
-What?
-I guess you're human after all.

34:48.586 --> 34:50.588
What exactly is my image to you?

34:50.671 --> 34:52.757
Hey. It's me.

34:52.840 --> 34:53.841
Yes.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.302
What happened with Asgard's farewell show?

34:57.512 --> 34:58.638
"Ah"?

34:59.722 --> 35:02.850
"Ah"? What's that? What does that mean?

35:02.934 --> 35:05.520
Jin-myung is stressed out because of that.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.939
Be honest. You forgot, didn't you?

35:10.233 --> 35:11.234
What?

35:12.401 --> 35:13.402
What did she say?

35:15.905 --> 35:16.864
Hold on.

35:20.576 --> 35:21.494
JI-WON

35:22.245 --> 35:23.788
Say that again.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.915
The location is...

36:04.203 --> 36:08.249
Okay. This is your last time
taking the stage as Asgard,

36:08.332 --> 36:09.584
so let's do our best.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.460
-Okay.
-Let's do this!

36:14.338 --> 36:15.173
Are you ready?

36:16.424 --> 36:17.508
When do we go on?

36:18.134 --> 36:20.928
You're up last. It was last minute,
so you aren't in the program.

36:21.804 --> 36:24.390
-Then we're the finale?
-This is insane.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.809
It's not really the finale...

36:29.395 --> 36:30.521
It is the finale.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.441
Jin-myung. I can't do it.

36:34.859 --> 36:35.902
What?

36:36.611 --> 36:40.031
I'm not good enough
for something like this. I'm just...

36:40.448 --> 36:41.532
Just what?

36:41.866 --> 36:44.911
I was expecting a small theater,
a community center,

36:45.661 --> 36:47.538
or maybe even a karaoke bar.

36:48.915 --> 36:49.874
But...

36:50.917 --> 36:52.710
I'll mess everything up. I can't do it.

36:52.793 --> 36:55.922
Shut it! Do you know
what I went through for this?

36:58.424 --> 36:59.926
Who cares if you mess up?

37:00.426 --> 37:02.094
It's your last time anyway.

37:03.554 --> 37:08.017
Whatever happens, sing your heart out.
That's all that matters, okay?

37:16.692 --> 37:17.735
See you later.

37:18.319 --> 37:19.445
Okay.

37:20.154 --> 37:21.322
You can do it.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.532
-We can do it.
-We can do it.

37:24.784 --> 37:25.618
Okay.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.518
-Did you have trouble finding the place?
-Not at all.

37:51.185 --> 37:52.186
Let's go.

37:52.895 --> 37:55.523
-You've come this far.
-We're finally together.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.985
WE ARE YOUNG
WE ARE ONE WITH YONSEI

38:11.122 --> 38:12.498
Jin-myung! You've come!

38:25.553 --> 38:26.387
Hello!

38:39.275 --> 38:41.944
Okay. The Fifth Column!

38:45.114 --> 38:47.658
-Encore!
-Encore!

38:47.742 --> 38:50.161
What? Encore? Hold on. No.

38:50.244 --> 38:53.914
They sang three encore songs already.
They can't do another one.

38:54.332 --> 38:58.336
Okay. I know you're sad,
but let me introduce the next group.

38:58.419 --> 39:01.213
The next group is Asgard?

39:01.297 --> 39:03.466
A group named Asgard.

39:03.549 --> 39:05.634
-They're up.
-We will end our show

39:05.718 --> 39:07.470
-Get ready.
-with their performance.

39:07.553 --> 39:11.182
-Get ready to cheer.
-We'll see you again next year.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.309
Thank you for coming.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.979
Asgard! Please come on out!

39:26.322 --> 39:27.656
YONSEI UNIVERSITY CHEERING SQUAD

39:42.338 --> 39:44.799
-Asgard!
-Asgard!

39:44.882 --> 39:47.301
-You are so awesome!
-You are so awesome!

39:48.010 --> 39:52.681
-Asgard! You are so awesome!
-Asgard! You are so awesome!

40:11.492 --> 40:12.493
-What!
-What!

40:24.713 --> 40:27.716
-Asgard! You are so awesome!
-Asgard! You are so awesome!

40:36.225 --> 40:38.769
I say "As," you say "gard."

40:38.853 --> 40:40.938
-As...
-Gard!

41:07.423 --> 41:08.591
Thank you, everyone.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.136
Thanks to God.

41:13.387 --> 41:14.763
Thanks to you guys.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.726
Special thanks to...

41:19.310 --> 41:20.311
Special.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.355
Jin-myung Yoon!

41:26.734 --> 41:29.612
She's here! Right here!

41:33.949 --> 41:35.117
Thank you.

41:35.201 --> 41:36.285
Thank you!

41:39.413 --> 41:40.706
Okay.

41:41.290 --> 41:42.374
Great job, everyone!

41:42.458 --> 41:43.834
Cheers!

42:28.712 --> 42:31.257
-General Cho!
-Why are you back already?

42:31.799 --> 42:33.801
We said goodbye at the bus stop.

42:34.843 --> 42:35.886
Why?

42:38.430 --> 42:42.351
He didn't want to leave you
in the sea of people waving?

42:42.685 --> 42:44.937
No. He said he was afraid he would cry.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.441
What about you? Aren't you sad?

42:49.775 --> 42:50.609
What for?

42:51.860 --> 42:56.740
I didn't want to show you

42:57.533 --> 43:00.869
My awkwardly short new haircut

43:03.163 --> 43:07.918
-I don't want to leave you
-I don't want to leave you

43:08.502 --> 43:12.673
-In the sea of people waving
-In the sea of people waving

43:13.507 --> 43:17.469
Will you forget me

43:18.137 --> 43:21.223
In those three years

43:22.224 --> 43:27.062
-When I told you not to wait for me
-When I told you not to wait for me

43:28.022 --> 43:31.191
It was because I felt bad

43:34.862 --> 43:37.990
TO NONSAN

43:45.914 --> 43:46.915
Enlisting?

43:48.626 --> 43:49.460
Yes.

43:51.962 --> 43:52.796
Who is that?

43:54.840 --> 43:55.799
My girlfriend.

44:09.521 --> 44:16.320
The day I left home and boarded the train

44:17.029 --> 44:22.826
To the army training camp

44:24.119 --> 44:30.709
After I bowed to my parents

44:31.669 --> 44:35.255
Are you making fried eggs?
Make me one too, please.

44:35.547 --> 44:39.051
And walked out the door

44:39.635 --> 44:43.222
There was a sadness

44:43.305 --> 44:47.017
That I could not understand

44:48.352 --> 44:49.186
Eun.

44:49.478 --> 44:53.982
Which filled my heart

44:54.066 --> 44:55.275
Eun.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.735
The grass

44:56.819 --> 44:57.778
Are you crying?

44:58.529 --> 45:00.114
Faces of friends

45:00.197 --> 45:01.240
Are you crying?

45:02.616 --> 45:03.742
What's wrong?

45:03.826 --> 45:06.412
Everything feels new

45:06.495 --> 45:08.539
Stop it! You're making her cry!

45:20.050 --> 45:20.884
Me?

45:34.690 --> 45:37.609
BRIGHT WORLD WITH JUSTICE

45:37.693 --> 45:40.821
If you have any evidence to produce,

45:41.363 --> 45:44.324
please submit them in advance
before the deadline.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.410
We will adjourn here today.

45:48.036 --> 45:49.872
Next case.

45:49.955 --> 45:53.750
Case number, 2007PA100465.

45:53.876 --> 45:56.336
Complainant Sun-young Oh.
Defendant Jae-man Park.

45:56.628 --> 45:57.588
Please come forward.

46:02.050 --> 46:03.260
I'm going to use the restroom.

46:19.067 --> 46:20.110
Are you positive?

46:27.451 --> 46:29.661
You don't have even one percent of doubt?

46:33.123 --> 46:34.583
Are you a hundred percent sure

46:35.959 --> 46:37.961
that you're right?

46:42.925 --> 46:43.759
What about you?

46:47.429 --> 46:49.806
Are you a hundred percent sure?

46:50.265 --> 46:51.266
Yes.

46:55.145 --> 46:55.979
You...

46:59.066 --> 47:00.817
shouldn't have done that.

47:20.295 --> 47:21.547
Excuse me.

47:27.094 --> 47:28.303
I...

47:30.013 --> 47:31.890
I thought a lot about it.

47:34.601 --> 47:36.895
I wanted to tell people,

47:37.980 --> 47:39.231
but at the time,

47:39.731 --> 47:45.028
my parents had just separated,
and they weren't very attentive to me.

47:47.322 --> 47:48.907
He was my art teacher.

47:50.701 --> 47:55.163
I told him about my situation...

48:05.090 --> 48:06.508
I want to hear it one more time.

48:13.599 --> 48:16.560
VOICE MEMO
NEW RECORDING

48:16.643 --> 48:18.228
May I record our conversation?

48:19.688 --> 48:20.522
Yes.

48:21.648 --> 48:23.108
Please state your name.

48:24.610 --> 48:28.447
My name is Ji-young Lim.

48:38.290 --> 48:39.166
Back then...

48:42.210 --> 48:43.962
I couldn't ask anyone

48:45.172 --> 48:47.507
to help me back then.

48:49.009 --> 48:51.803
I couldn't trust any adult.

49:10.030 --> 49:12.115
I was so nervous that I wanted to die.

49:13.283 --> 49:15.202
Not because I was afraid
of losing the trial,

49:16.828 --> 49:19.873
but because I was afraid
that I was mistaken.

49:23.043 --> 49:24.419
But...

49:25.379 --> 49:27.673
when I heard that woman talk,

49:29.841 --> 49:33.345
I was actually relieved on the inside.

49:34.221 --> 49:35.764
That isn't right,

49:38.266 --> 49:40.143
but I felt relieved.

49:42.521 --> 49:43.355
Dang it.

49:45.607 --> 49:47.776
I was so afraid.

49:52.030 --> 49:53.365
-Are you done crying?
-Yes.

49:55.701 --> 49:56.702
Your nose is running.

50:12.050 --> 50:13.510
-Mom.
-Hi.

50:13.593 --> 50:14.428
Hello.

50:15.345 --> 50:16.596
You're pretty.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.889
I told you she was.

50:18.598 --> 50:19.850
Come in.

50:20.600 --> 50:21.893
Thank you.

50:22.018 --> 50:24.396
-Is that for me?
-Yes, it is.

50:25.605 --> 50:26.648
How lovely.

50:26.940 --> 50:30.986
How did you know I liked hydrangeas?
Did Ho-chang tell you?

50:31.069 --> 50:33.780
No. I just chose what I like.

50:33.864 --> 50:36.742
Really? This feels really nice.

50:36.825 --> 50:38.827
We must have similar taste.

50:39.870 --> 50:42.706
Why don't you sit here and wait?
I'm almost done.

50:43.039 --> 50:44.666
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

50:47.878 --> 50:50.756
-Aren't you a nutritional science major?
-Yes, ma'am.

50:50.839 --> 50:53.049
I just made rice cake and dumpling soup.

50:53.425 --> 50:56.470
It's all about flavor for me.
Don't judge how it looks, okay?

50:57.053 --> 50:57.888
Okay.

51:02.434 --> 51:04.853
-I can speak casually, right?
-Of course.

51:09.816 --> 51:10.817
I'm going to the bathroom.

51:27.083 --> 51:30.295
Ho-chang. Your sisters must be here.

51:30.629 --> 51:32.714
They came?

51:35.175 --> 51:36.343
Hi.

51:36.426 --> 51:39.471
-Hey, Ho-chang!
-Hey, Ho-chang!

51:39.554 --> 51:42.390
-Why did you come?
-I heard you brought a girl home.

51:42.724 --> 51:45.227
Uncle's girlfriend is here.

51:45.310 --> 51:46.269
Where is she?

51:46.394 --> 51:48.855
-I have to get back to the office.
-Let's go see her.

51:57.656 --> 51:58.824
Hello.

52:02.828 --> 52:04.120
Hello.

52:05.205 --> 52:06.623
Hello.

52:07.415 --> 52:08.542
Hi.

52:08.625 --> 52:10.961
You girls are impossible.
Why did you come?

52:11.044 --> 52:12.128
You'll scare Ye-eun.

52:12.212 --> 52:14.089
She's Ho-chang's first girlfriend.

52:14.422 --> 52:17.050
In-soo wanted to take the day off to come.
I barely stopped him.

52:18.260 --> 52:21.179
-This looks so good.
-It's a feast!

52:21.930 --> 52:23.640
-Help me with these.
-Okay.

52:24.015 --> 52:25.350
It looks yummy.

52:26.142 --> 52:27.894
You all made these, Mom?

52:28.103 --> 52:29.729
Hi, Shi-eun.

52:30.188 --> 52:31.606
-Come to Grandma.
-Here.

52:31.690 --> 52:33.859
-Okay, that's it.
-Come here.

52:39.698 --> 52:40.949
-Sit down.
-Okay.

52:41.449 --> 52:42.784
She really sat down.

52:44.035 --> 52:46.329
-I was just kidding
-Hey.

52:46.413 --> 52:47.831
Stop that.

52:48.331 --> 52:50.250
-Sit down and eat.
-It's good.

52:50.876 --> 52:52.377
-Thank you.
-Sure.

52:52.460 --> 52:55.213
-Our mom really is the best cook.
-She sure is.

52:55.881 --> 52:57.382
Ho-chang's a little frustrating, right?

52:57.465 --> 52:58.550
Yes... No.

52:58.633 --> 53:00.510
But he's a good kid, so be nice to him.

53:01.011 --> 53:02.846
-Please be good to him.
-Please be good to him.

53:05.473 --> 53:07.976
Ho-chang, you changed a lot
since you started dating.

53:08.268 --> 53:09.811
Wearing stocking-like pants, too.

53:09.936 --> 53:13.565
He even wore contacts,
although his eyes got infected.

53:13.648 --> 53:15.317
Look at that playboy haircut.

53:15.400 --> 53:19.070
Ye-eun, say something.
He won't listen to us at all.

53:19.154 --> 53:22.908
Stop making Ye-eun uncomfortable.
She can't even eat.

53:22.991 --> 53:24.284
She took me...

53:26.828 --> 53:28.455
Mom, this tastes good.

53:28.538 --> 53:29.831
-Does it?
-Yes.

53:29.915 --> 53:31.791
-It's delicious.
-Eat up.

53:32.334 --> 53:34.002
It's delicious.

53:35.462 --> 53:36.713
Can you pack some of these, Mom?

53:36.796 --> 53:38.381
-Okay.
-I want too.

54:00.362 --> 54:01.821
JIN-GWANG

54:01.905 --> 54:04.282
Jin-myung. We finished
renovating the interior.

54:04.866 --> 54:07.285
Come visit.
You get a number one fan discount.

54:14.918 --> 54:17.587
Should we go visit Jin-gwang?

54:18.713 --> 54:20.507
Let's go. Exams are over, anyway.

54:20.674 --> 54:24.302
Is this his parents' bed and breakfast?
It's nice.

54:25.136 --> 54:26.554
It's really nice.

54:26.930 --> 54:29.140
-But it looks familiar.
-I know, right?

54:29.349 --> 54:31.017
All bed and breakfasts look alike.

54:41.111 --> 54:43.530
Find out if any payment is due.

54:44.572 --> 54:46.992
If they need the guardian's signature
for something, sign it.

54:48.284 --> 54:50.578
Stop by often,
even if the private nurse is there.

54:50.954 --> 54:52.747
Don't let just anyone in.

54:54.833 --> 54:55.917
What?

54:56.292 --> 54:57.252
Okay.

55:14.102 --> 55:14.936
How is that?

55:16.062 --> 55:17.439
-Is that good?
-Yes.

55:21.985 --> 55:24.029
-I'll go get more water.
-Okay.

55:35.707 --> 55:38.043
What should we eat?
How about that place we went last time?

55:38.126 --> 55:38.960
Sounds good.

55:48.595 --> 55:49.429
Hi.

55:50.805 --> 55:51.848
Hi.

55:54.225 --> 55:55.226
Let's go.

56:09.157 --> 56:10.992
We used to say, "Let's not change."

56:13.078 --> 56:16.706
We swore we wouldn't change
until the day we died.

56:16.790 --> 56:18.750
-Hello.
-Hello.

56:18.833 --> 56:20.418
-Are you going home?
-Yes.

56:22.545 --> 56:26.132
If you live with Ji-won,
you must never be bored.

56:26.257 --> 56:27.634
You're right. Ji-won...

56:28.218 --> 56:31.554
-You live in Yeonnam, right?
-Yes, I do.

56:32.222 --> 56:33.556
I also live in Yeonnam.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.517
-You do?
-Yes.

56:38.061 --> 56:39.604
I thought we wouldn't change.

56:39.687 --> 56:42.398
There is a restaurant in Yeonnam
that I go to all the time.

56:42.482 --> 56:45.610
I thought as long as we had each other,
it would be enough.

56:48.863 --> 56:50.198
Who was the bad one?

56:50.281 --> 56:53.159
I'm sorry. What did you say?

56:53.284 --> 56:55.078
Is it the one who changed?

56:55.161 --> 56:56.538
It's okay.

56:57.330 --> 56:59.833
Or is it the one who couldn't?

57:13.805 --> 57:16.975
You and I are like two pieces of a puzzle
that don't fit.

57:19.727 --> 57:23.273
If you try to force them to fit,
you'll end up hurting them.

57:25.942 --> 57:29.612
If you try to shrink away
because you're afraid

57:29.696 --> 57:31.322
of hurting the person that you like,

57:32.407 --> 57:34.701
the pointy edges will stab you.

57:37.328 --> 57:40.665
It hurts if you get closer,
but if you grow apart,

57:41.624 --> 57:42.917
it feels like you'll die.

57:46.671 --> 57:49.048
What? You're sleeping here again?

57:49.674 --> 57:50.592
You didn't go home?

57:51.217 --> 57:54.471
It seems futile.
I have to come back tomorrow anyway.

58:01.394 --> 58:03.521
You like Ji-won, don't you?

58:06.274 --> 58:07.192
Why don't you two date?

58:11.237 --> 58:13.072
Is being a boyfriend better
than being a friend?

58:13.156 --> 58:14.657
Well that's...

58:15.909 --> 58:18.620
What if she ends up getting a boyfriend?

58:21.539 --> 58:22.665
At least tell her.

58:27.504 --> 58:30.507
It's okay.
I like things the way they are now.

58:32.967 --> 58:36.221
-That's nonsense. You're scared...
-Quiet.

58:37.055 --> 58:40.558
Sleep. I'm depressed enough as it is.
Why did you have to come?

58:44.479 --> 58:46.022
-Why did you come, anyway?
-What?

58:46.147 --> 58:46.981
Why?

58:47.398 --> 58:48.691
Why? Do you know anything?

58:49.192 --> 58:50.860
Why are you lecturing me?

58:51.736 --> 58:53.988
Do you have any idea how I feel?

59:07.252 --> 59:09.128
-Yi-na.
-Why is the door open?

59:09.587 --> 59:10.588
-Hey.
-Hi.

59:11.005 --> 59:12.799
-I'll take that.
-Is that food?

59:13.716 --> 59:15.051
-Hello.
-Hello.

59:15.134 --> 59:17.053
-Are you coming from abroad?
-Yes.

59:17.470 --> 59:20.723
Nice. This is the most comfortable place
in the world.

59:23.643 --> 59:25.979
This looks yummy. You're the best.

59:29.399 --> 59:30.733
Can we eat first?

59:49.002 --> 59:49.836
What?

59:51.045 --> 59:53.965
I'll be back. Make sure to eat.

1:00:01.681 --> 1:00:03.224
Well, I...

1:00:04.434 --> 1:00:07.645
I'm not ready yet,
but you said it was the end, so...

1:00:08.146 --> 1:00:11.107
It... It was nice to meet you, but...

1:00:14.527 --> 1:00:17.280
It will be nice if we meet again.
Whatever. Bye.

1:00:26.247 --> 1:00:28.207
Saying goodbye all of a sudden?

1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:30.501
Okay, then.

1:00:31.753 --> 1:00:33.880
Bye! Thank you for everything.

1:00:34.380 --> 1:00:35.423
I was happy.

1:00:35.506 --> 1:00:36.716
Adieu.

1:00:38.509 --> 1:00:39.719
Have a good life.

1:00:49.729 --> 1:00:52.148
Make sure to eat well every day.

1:00:53.524 --> 1:00:55.401
Let's be happy every day.

1:00:56.778 --> 1:00:57.654
I'll be back.

1:00:58.488 --> 1:01:00.490
I have changed a lot, haven't I?

1:01:00.907 --> 1:01:03.660
They say people and love change.

1:01:05.953 --> 1:01:07.246
Thank you for everything.

1:01:10.166 --> 1:01:11.125
Bye.

1:01:31.854 --> 1:01:34.899
Thank you for watching
