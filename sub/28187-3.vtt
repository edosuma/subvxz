WEBVTT

00:05.632 --> 00:07.550
Mr. World wants to know why

00:07.717 --> 00:10.345
Mr. Wednesday would bring
a nobody into his tribe.

00:10.512 --> 00:12.055
I'm just a bodyguard.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.644
There's a devil in the French
Quarter of New Orleans.

00:17.811 --> 00:20.814
None better with the spice
of life than the old Baron.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.899
I need the eyes of Argus

00:23.066 --> 00:25.527
on my side to see my enemies.

00:25.819 --> 00:27.904
Make the connection for me.

00:28.405 --> 00:31.032
Ifrit, Grimnir needs you
at the Corn Palace.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.909
Ask for Old Iktomi.

00:33.076 --> 00:35.328
- To what end?
- Gungnir.

00:35.995 --> 00:37.622
Find Media.

00:37.789 --> 00:39.040
Oh, Media!

00:39.207 --> 00:41.459
Come on.
Mr. World wants you.

00:41.626 --> 00:43.670
We will meet in
your reincarnation.

00:43.837 --> 00:45.880
Be proud, Betty.

02:27.524 --> 02:29.442
Betty the Barbarian,

02:30.693 --> 02:31.861
a Berserker!

02:42.497 --> 02:43.957
Be proud!

02:51.339 --> 02:52.674
Be proud!

03:00.598 --> 03:01.933
Valhalla!

03:02.976 --> 03:04.727
Betty the Barbarian.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.897
A Berserker!

03:36.968 --> 03:38.344
Shadow!

03:46.352 --> 03:47.645
Shadow!

03:50.607 --> 03:51.691
Shadow!

03:53.902 --> 03:55.653
Laura!

04:00.199 --> 04:02.160
Laura!

04:06.789 --> 04:08.708
Ah, Mrs. Moon.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.043
Fuck.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.253
Did we sit on a wall?

04:12.420 --> 04:15.632
Did we have
a great fall?

04:15.798 --> 04:18.051
Shadow's here somewhere.
We have to find him.

04:18.217 --> 04:20.803
Sweeney, pick up the arms
and the talkie bits, would you?

04:24.182 --> 04:25.308
Laura!

04:25.475 --> 04:26.684
Don't do this.

04:26.851 --> 04:28.436
I've always been a leg man
myself, Laura.

04:29.771 --> 04:31.564
- Don't help him.
- Pipe down!

04:31.981 --> 04:34.025
Believe it or not,
I'm helping you.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.656
C'mon! Put her in the trunk!

04:39.822 --> 04:41.366
Motherfucker!

04:45.370 --> 04:46.871
I trusted you.

04:48.915 --> 04:50.708
Fucking vultures!

04:57.382 --> 04:59.425
Welcome back, Betty.

04:59.592 --> 05:02.595
Shadow! Shadow!

05:04.472 --> 05:06.474
You sure you wanna
leave the oaf?

05:06.641 --> 05:08.059
Shadow!

05:08.226 --> 05:09.769
Am I the only one
that has faith in Shadow?

05:09.936 --> 05:11.896
My faith is waning.

05:12.063 --> 05:14.357
The quickest way for Shadow
to get where he's going

05:14.524 --> 05:17.068
- is sometimes the longest.
- Motherfucker!

07:00.505 --> 07:02.381
Cairo! Cairo!

07:02.548 --> 07:03.925
Cairo...

07:07.303 --> 07:08.638
Cairo.

07:08.805 --> 07:10.223
Egyptian.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.724
Egyptian?

07:16.437 --> 07:17.980
No more.

07:30.368 --> 07:32.120
What's the news, Muninn?

07:33.996 --> 07:37.041
Did you find our boy?

07:37.208 --> 07:39.168
Excellent.

07:40.253 --> 07:42.630
Okay. You can fuck off now.

07:50.847 --> 07:53.015
Right arm.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.767
Five pounds, two ounces.

07:54.934 --> 07:59.689
Loss of one ounce to necrosis
plus a quarter ounce of maggots

08:00.273 --> 08:02.942
Nature's way of saying
you've overstayed your welcome.

08:06.112 --> 08:07.947
You just gonna lie there,

08:08.114 --> 08:09.532
let nature have her way
with you?

08:09.699 --> 08:11.075
Hey!

08:11.242 --> 08:12.535
Snap out of it,
ya fuckin' cunt!

08:16.414 --> 08:19.000
- Told you not to call me that.
- Ah.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.793
There she is.

08:24.839 --> 08:26.716
Are you eating me?

08:26.883 --> 08:29.635
The funerary arts
we practice are ancient.

08:29.802 --> 08:32.180
The deceased don't generally
witness them.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.973
Ugh.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.018
You've changed
since I last worked on you.

08:37.185 --> 08:39.270
The first time we met,
you didn't believe in anything.

08:39.437 --> 08:41.022
But now... well...

08:42.064 --> 08:43.524
It's definitely something.

08:44.192 --> 08:45.943
I believe in Shadow.

08:46.110 --> 08:48.696
And as soon as you've
got me all stitched up,

08:48.863 --> 08:50.031
I'm gonna do

08:50.198 --> 08:51.657
what the Cowardly Lion
over there

08:51.824 --> 08:53.743
wouldn't let me do before,
and I'm gonna save him.

08:53.910 --> 08:55.119
Coward?

08:55.286 --> 08:56.245
I saved you.

08:56.412 --> 08:57.705
I'm dead, Coward.

08:57.872 --> 08:59.874
Well, you're welcome
for picking up all your gory

09:00.041 --> 09:02.210
little fuckin' pieces
up off the road!

09:03.878 --> 09:06.005
I wonder how much longer
I'm gonna be fixable.

09:06.172 --> 09:09.050
I mean, how long until all this
is just... maggots?

09:11.093 --> 09:13.346
Can you stop
chewing, please?

09:13.512 --> 09:16.557
God! Just finish me up!

09:16.933 --> 09:18.601
And can ya hurry it up, Ibis?

09:18.768 --> 09:21.229
Mrs. Moon and I
have a date with Argus.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.147
That old dog?

09:23.314 --> 09:25.441
No, not Odysseus's mutt.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.526
The man with all the eyes.
Argus Panoptes.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.320
- Argus?
- Mm.

09:29.487 --> 09:33.032
- To what end?
- Sorry, why should I help you?

09:33.199 --> 09:35.243
Well, those stitches
ain't gonna last forever.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.578
I give it another week.

09:37.745 --> 09:42.124
My old friend Argus
can recharge your coin.

09:42.667 --> 09:43.918
Stop the rot.

09:44.085 --> 09:45.461
He's lyin' to ya.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.755
Argus is nothing
but a standard-issue

09:47.922 --> 09:49.006
peeping fuckin' Tom.

09:49.173 --> 09:50.841
I'm going to New Orleans,
dead wife.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.843
I suggest
you come with me.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.595
I can get you
what you actually need.

09:55.638 --> 09:58.307
Your man works for me,
Mrs. Moon.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.017
Mark my words.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.603
You're gonna need the Baron,
dead wife.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.022
I'll see you in New Orleans.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.818
Let's go, Mr. Wednesday.
Thank you.

10:09.944 --> 10:12.154
You're a bigger fool
than I thought you were!

10:12.321 --> 10:14.115
If you still trust him after...

10:21.706 --> 10:23.749
Keep an eye out
for her dearly beloved.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.502
A little bird told me
Shadow's on his way.

10:37.096 --> 10:38.180
Fuck.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.364
Oh-ho.

10:56.032 --> 10:57.950
Oh, this is heavenly.

10:58.576 --> 11:00.870
And a beautiful angel too.

11:01.037 --> 11:04.707
My goodness,
it is so humid out there.

11:04.874 --> 11:07.084
Y'all should get a water.
It's 69 cents plus tax,

11:07.251 --> 11:09.295
but it ain't gonna help
with the humidity.

11:09.462 --> 11:11.672
Perfect. And
please ignore this.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.133
I went hiking,
I may have fallen over.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.801
It's a little bit
embarrassing.

11:16.469 --> 11:18.888
Um, I only have a 20 on me.
You got enough singles?

11:19.055 --> 11:20.473
Oh, yeah,
no problem.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.475
Great, thanks.

11:23.059 --> 11:26.437
So, the water and the map
together is $7.02.

11:26.604 --> 11:27.772
Great.

11:28.647 --> 11:29.815
Oh, uh...

11:29.982 --> 11:31.359
I may have

11:31.525 --> 11:34.862
something
a little bit smaller.

11:35.029 --> 11:36.822
'Cause, no, I-I
don't wanna...

11:37.656 --> 11:39.492
I don't wanna get
all your change there.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.327
So, if I give you
three singles,

11:41.494 --> 11:43.746
then you can just
give me my 20 back.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.707
And I'll take
a beautiful smile.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.292
I'll tell you what.

11:48.459 --> 11:50.920
My two kids wiped that smile
off my face a long time ago.

11:51.087 --> 11:53.339
- No.
- Hey.

11:53.506 --> 11:55.007
That's not right.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.053
He never paid you
for that pretty smile.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.930
He don't owe me for that.

12:01.097 --> 12:02.765
Then you don't mind
if I take it.

12:02.932 --> 12:04.642
Give me 20 on Pump 2.

12:04.809 --> 12:06.644
Well, that's not up to me.
It's his money.

12:06.811 --> 12:08.687
Trust me.
He doesn't mind.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.731
Well, do you two
know each other?

12:11.690 --> 12:13.025
Oh, I know him.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.825
Ah, there you go.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.953
Um... thank you.
Thank you.

12:30.209 --> 12:31.252
Hey.

12:32.545 --> 12:35.840
So, uh... how far is that
20 gonna take me?

12:36.006 --> 12:38.259
From where you were standing
to where you are now.

12:40.386 --> 12:42.805
Look, I... I just need
to get to Cairo.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.642
- It's Cay-row.
- Cay-- Cay-row?

12:53.649 --> 12:54.942
You homeless
or something?

12:55.109 --> 12:58.487
Ah, heh, no, no, no.
It's just...

13:00.573 --> 13:04.452
I was just hiking and, and I,
I just, I slipped on this rock.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.746
I busted my ass. Ended up
just tearing all down here.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.582
You're a liar.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.673
Hey, can...

13:19.341 --> 13:21.635
- What's that about?
- Evidence.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.472
Case you turn into
a psycho down the road.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.224
Get in.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.145
Why Argus?

13:33.189 --> 13:36.317
Well, even before
her union to Zeus,

13:36.484 --> 13:40.404
Hera, Goddess of marriage
and childbirth,

13:40.571 --> 13:43.532
ruled over the heavens
and the Earth.

13:46.202 --> 13:49.788
The wisdom of Zeus
is best exemplified

13:49.955 --> 13:52.124
in the fear he had
of his sister,

13:53.042 --> 13:55.044
for she was also his wife.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.672
They fought frequently

13:58.839 --> 14:02.051
over his many
extramarital affairs

14:02.218 --> 14:04.178
and illegitimate children,
but in the end,

14:04.345 --> 14:08.933
all Gods fall victim
to their thirst for worship.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.364
The advantage of love
at first sight...

14:25.783 --> 14:28.160
...is it doesn't require
a second look.

14:35.251 --> 14:38.087
Zeus saw the River God's
beautiful daughter Io,

14:38.254 --> 14:40.214
and fell madly in love.

14:42.550 --> 14:44.426
He consummated his desires

14:44.593 --> 14:47.096
without any consideration
of the consequences.

14:48.347 --> 14:50.683
Displeased with
Zeus's infidelity,

14:50.849 --> 14:54.353
Hera turned Io into a cow
and summoned her servant Argus

14:54.520 --> 14:58.148
to keep the heifer
away from her husband.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.318
Frustrated by his own desires,

15:01.485 --> 15:05.614
Zeus sent Hermes to deliver
a fatal message to Argus.

15:07.324 --> 15:12.037
The death of the All-Seeing One
angered the Queen of Goddesses.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.956
In an act of vengeance,

15:14.123 --> 15:17.585
she channeled her will
and Argus was reborn,

15:17.751 --> 15:21.964
in America, as the God
of Surveillance.

15:22.131 --> 15:25.801
But as his believers waned,
so did his sight.

15:26.677 --> 15:29.054
Only his memories remain intact

15:29.722 --> 15:33.851
An alliance with the New Gods
seems imminent.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.777
This was an hour ago.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.363
He was heading south
into Illinois, of all places,

15:46.530 --> 15:50.576
with an unidentified female
before we lost connection.

15:50.743 --> 15:52.286
I've got nine more
on the way.

15:52.453 --> 15:54.330
They'll notify me

15:54.496 --> 15:56.915
as soon as they relocate
Wednesday's little minion.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.043
And the drone that went down?

16:00.377 --> 16:02.463
I can't confirm
the exact location.

16:02.630 --> 16:05.174
The GPS logs were corrupted.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.344
If the network
had been upgraded...

16:09.428 --> 16:12.598
First of all, fuck you.

16:12.765 --> 16:17.895
Second, I told Argus to upgrade
this hub eons ago.

16:18.062 --> 16:22.358
I am not some
ant-fucking micromanager.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.656
Have you heard of the...

16:29.323 --> 16:30.699
...broken-window theory?

16:31.950 --> 16:34.078
A broken window in
a nice neighborhood...

16:35.329 --> 16:39.500
...signals to all who see it
that the norms have slipped.

16:39.875 --> 16:44.171
Your broken window
has signaled to every God

16:44.338 --> 16:46.173
that has not chosen a side

16:46.340 --> 16:49.093
that my house is not in order.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.845
Get your man in line!

16:56.100 --> 16:59.186
You do not want me
to solve this.

17:06.443 --> 17:07.695
Right.

17:09.822 --> 17:12.783
- I'm texting--
- You will go to him in person.

17:12.950 --> 17:15.536
- Why?
- Tradition!

17:17.955 --> 17:20.791
We build the new world

17:22.543 --> 17:25.546
on top of the ruins
of the old.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.138
<i>Download complete.</i>

17:35.222 --> 17:36.390
<i>Compiling.</i>

17:39.184 --> 17:40.769
<i>Run program.</i>

18:28.442 --> 18:29.818
Media.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.653
Oh, that's just so old.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.990
This here is New.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.827
New Media.

18:38.994 --> 18:42.164
Ah, and that's a...

18:43.040 --> 18:46.835
...happy birthday to me.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.923
So, what's our play, boys?

18:52.549 --> 18:55.719
- Argus.
- Ah, fuck, yes!

18:55.886 --> 18:58.639
The man with the fiber optics!

18:59.097 --> 19:01.433
You know, that's my jam.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.561
- Good.
- Ah.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.025
Uh...

19:11.151 --> 19:13.987
How the fuck
is that an upgrade?

19:16.698 --> 19:18.283
What is this place again?

19:18.450 --> 19:20.536
Oh, ask the local
tinfoil-hat brigade.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.621
They'll tell you
it's the secret HQ for

19:22.788 --> 19:24.498
the Deep State,
the Illuminati,

19:24.665 --> 19:26.416
the men in black.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.585
Ask the local council,
city hall, they'll tell you,

19:28.752 --> 19:30.671
"Ah, it's just a warehouse
full of computers."

19:30.838 --> 19:33.507
- What's the truth?
- Truth is Argus,

19:33.674 --> 19:36.426
and the truth doesn't care
which version you prefer.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.637
The truth is just
information.

19:38.804 --> 19:40.973
And information will win the war
for you, if you let it.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.933
- I'm not in a war.
- Oh, you are

19:43.100 --> 19:45.018
if you wanna get
that heart ticking.

19:45.185 --> 19:48.981
Come on! We're taking
the scenic route.

19:53.819 --> 19:55.946
Interesting choice.

19:56.989 --> 19:59.533
- Old school.
- The fuck are we?

19:59.700 --> 20:01.410
We're in a field.

20:02.619 --> 20:05.205
Well, memory of a field.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.044
- Is he dead?
- Oh, deader than you.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.964
What did you come
back for, anyway?

20:14.131 --> 20:15.966
Who is he?

20:16.425 --> 20:19.511
That's an old version
of Argus,

20:20.012 --> 20:21.763
a cast-off husk

20:21.930 --> 20:24.391
after he changed
into something else.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.393
Now, you revenants,

20:26.560 --> 20:28.395
and that's what you are,
my dear,

20:28.562 --> 20:31.023
you tend to be single use.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.066
You come back
to do the one thing,

20:33.233 --> 20:35.736
and then slip back off
the mortal coil.

20:36.028 --> 20:39.239
So, what's your mission?

20:39.406 --> 20:42.284
You know what
my mission is: Shadow.

20:42.451 --> 20:45.078
Oh, so, marriage, kids,

20:45.245 --> 20:47.789
summer house? I mean,
how do you see this ending?

20:47.956 --> 20:49.833
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.501
So, you're working
on faith, huh?

20:51.668 --> 20:53.295
I definitely wouldn't use
that word, but...

20:53.462 --> 20:55.088
You, uh, came back
from the dead,

20:55.255 --> 20:56.924
but you're not even curious why?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.926
I see a golden beam
of light wherever he is,

20:59.092 --> 21:01.053
so from where I'm sitting
it's pretty cut and dry.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.554
Oh.

21:04.056 --> 21:05.557
Do you, uh...

21:07.392 --> 21:08.936
Do you see one here?

21:10.312 --> 21:12.731
- No.
- Interesting.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.988
Shadow made my heart
beat again.

21:21.031 --> 21:23.241
He kissed me and my dead
fucking heart beat.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.202
That has to count
for something.

21:25.369 --> 21:28.163
Uh-huh. In death as in life,
it's all about Laura Moon.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.248
You saw a light.
Your heart beats.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.126
What about Shadow?
What about his heart, huh?

21:33.293 --> 21:35.337
He's got a nice stretch of road
ahead of him now.

21:35.504 --> 21:37.506
He doesn't want
to spend it with a corpse.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.467
You really think you can compete
with what I can show him?

21:40.968 --> 21:42.511
Yeah, I do actually.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.138
You were beautiful,

21:45.305 --> 21:46.848
and kind,

21:47.015 --> 21:49.476
and your lover will
remember you forever.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.232
Odin thanks you
personally for this gift.

22:17.713 --> 22:19.047
Jesus Christ.

22:29.891 --> 22:32.227
Change requires sacrifice.

22:50.203 --> 22:51.705

I didn't picture
the Corn Palace like this.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.001
In my head it was
a lot more yellow.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.128
Like corn.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.297
Roadside attractions

Alright, guys,

24:26.091 --> 24:27.509
you've been waitin'

24:27.676 --> 24:31.972
Welcome to the stage
the beautiful Tamara!

24:41.648 --> 24:44.109
Is Old Iktomi
a Jinn like you?

24:45.402 --> 24:49.281
Iktomi is a shapeshifter
and a spider like Mr. Nancy.

24:49.447 --> 24:51.324
He controls humans
like puppets

24:51.491 --> 24:54.244
so, whatever you do,
do not look him in the eyes.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.705
How did he get
Gungnir?

24:57.914 --> 25:00.250
Trickster Gods always
seem to find a way.

25:10.844 --> 25:12.179
Ifrit.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.058
You smell of sex with humans.

25:18.810 --> 25:21.313
Well, maybe that's because
I like to fuck humans!

25:23.273 --> 25:25.317
- How are you, my friend?
- I'm good, my friend.

25:25.942 --> 25:29.988
Iktomi will grant
Votan's request,

25:30.155 --> 25:32.908
but expects
a favor in return.

25:33.074 --> 25:34.242
Follow me.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.226
I was listening
to this audiobook

25:59.392 --> 26:01.144
before you bought
a ticket to ride.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.147
You ever hear
of the Crow Nation warrior

26:04.314 --> 26:05.815
named Finds Them
and Kills Them?

26:07.192 --> 26:09.653
No, but he sounds
very efficient.

26:13.323 --> 26:15.033
He was different.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.827
Like me: two-spirited.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.088
You're human, right?

26:29.547 --> 26:32.133
You're not
some buffalo queen,

26:32.842 --> 26:35.595
pulling coins outta hoards,
turn into fucking spiders?

26:35.762 --> 26:38.682
Not yet.

26:40.350 --> 26:41.977
Although, if this were
back in the day,

26:42.143 --> 26:43.520
I would've been godlike.

26:43.687 --> 26:45.438
Why?

26:48.400 --> 26:49.943
Two spirits
in one body,

26:50.944 --> 26:52.654
both masculine
and feminine.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.865
It was considered a gift
from the Creator.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.665
Yeah, well,
Gods only give gifts

27:03.832 --> 27:05.709
when they get
something in return.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.212
Okay.

27:10.547 --> 27:12.340
The only gift
my people ever got

27:12.507 --> 27:15.385
was a cozy smallpox
blanket and genocide.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.553
Fuckin' hell!

28:06.102 --> 28:08.188

28:40.762 --> 28:43.264
Have you never
been in a library?

28:43.890 --> 28:45.433
I love libraries.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.812
I miss libraries.
This is not a library.

28:49.229 --> 28:50.897
Oh, this is a library.

28:51.731 --> 28:54.484
This is a memory of a library.

28:54.651 --> 28:56.277
Is that the same
guy from the field?

28:56.444 --> 28:58.738
Oh, don't feel sorry for him.
He's moved on.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.574
So, the game is that we follow
the trail of dead bodies

29:01.741 --> 29:04.786
until we get to the most recent
version of your friend Argus?

29:04.953 --> 29:06.579
Smart dead girl.

29:06.955 --> 29:09.165
I can see
what Shadow saw in you.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.793
You don't know
the first thing about me.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.379
Oh, I know everything
about you.

29:14.546 --> 29:16.172
Everything.

29:16.339 --> 29:18.174
You say you miss libraries.

29:18.341 --> 29:21.845
Remember that book you kept
and said it was lost?

29:22.011 --> 29:24.222
When you were 10,
you took it home,

29:24.389 --> 29:28.059
your dad got drunk, as usual,
spilled some booze on it.

29:28.226 --> 29:30.812
It stunk and stained so bad you
were ashamed to take it back.

29:30.979 --> 29:32.480
What was the title of it?

29:34.065 --> 29:35.733
Tiger Eyes. Judy Blume.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.404
And have you
visited a library since?

29:41.906 --> 29:43.491
It's a cool party trick.

29:44.033 --> 29:47.078
You know a story about me.
You don't know me.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.584
You know,
your friend isn't exactly

29:52.750 --> 29:54.627
rolling out
the red carpet for us.

29:54.794 --> 29:58.298
He... is not expecting us.

30:00.592 --> 30:03.511
I want it to be a surprise.

30:08.766 --> 30:11.769
You know you don't want
Shadow, don't you?

30:11.936 --> 30:14.105
Please, tell me more
about what I want.

30:14.272 --> 30:15.982
You want to feel.

30:16.441 --> 30:18.234
You want that rush of blood
to the head

30:18.401 --> 30:20.028
when you stand up too fast.

30:20.195 --> 30:23.156
Fuck too hard.
Kill those guys on the train.

30:23.448 --> 30:26.910
You gotta get that ticker
ticking, by hook or by crook.

30:27.785 --> 30:30.288
Shadow is frightened
of that girl, isn't he?

30:31.164 --> 30:32.832
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.667
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

30:34.834 --> 30:38.213
You are not the girl he fell
in love with anymore.

30:38.379 --> 30:39.839
Are you?

30:43.801 --> 30:45.553
You know, that's really
none of your business.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.514
So, why don't you
just tell me

30:47.680 --> 30:49.349
how the fuck we can
get out of here?

30:50.642 --> 30:52.560
Well, that is obvious, huh?

30:54.604 --> 30:55.939
Sacrifice.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.025
Okay, well, this guy's
already dead.

30:59.192 --> 31:00.860
So, are there rats or something?

31:01.027 --> 31:02.946
What's the worst thing
you can do to a book?

31:03.112 --> 31:06.407
Um... Ignore it?

31:10.245 --> 31:14.123
This is a memory of the Great
Library of Alexandria.

31:14.582 --> 31:17.085
It contained a copy
of every book ever written.

31:17.252 --> 31:19.837
You could spend a lifetime
in here and many did.

31:20.004 --> 31:22.006
Until Caesar
came to town.

31:23.132 --> 31:25.802
He laid siege
to the city.

31:27.512 --> 31:29.347
When he was backed
into a corner,

31:30.723 --> 31:32.559
he set fire
to his own ships.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.644
His own men.

31:35.687 --> 31:37.730
They died looking up

31:37.897 --> 31:40.191
to as much of the sky
as they could see

31:40.358 --> 31:42.527
through the smoke
and the flames.

31:43.111 --> 31:45.405
Some must have lasted
long enough

31:45.572 --> 31:49.951
to see the fire roll up
to the Great Library.

31:52.996 --> 31:54.622
Oh, that was sacrifice.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.045
Burn, baby, burn.

33:46.526 --> 33:47.735
You hungry?

33:51.197 --> 33:53.032
Yeah. I could eat.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.473
Tell Votan not to forget
who his friends are

34:17.640 --> 34:19.517
when this is over.

34:19.684 --> 34:21.185
That motherfucker
has no friends.

34:26.649 --> 34:28.359
Iktomi is here.

34:31.863 --> 34:33.448
Whoa.

34:33.614 --> 34:36.159
This place is definitely
about the green.

34:43.875 --> 34:45.960
You've brought me
a sacrifice?

34:49.422 --> 34:52.133
Votan offers no worship.

34:55.428 --> 34:56.971
I'm Salim.

34:58.097 --> 35:01.017
Can I offer you drink
or smoke?

35:01.184 --> 35:02.560
Come now.

35:02.727 --> 35:06.105
Your tricks, your potions.

35:06.731 --> 35:09.817
They do not work on me.
Remember?

35:10.818 --> 35:12.403
When the time comes,

35:12.862 --> 35:15.281
Votan must pay homage.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.791
Iktomi.

35:41.474 --> 35:43.643
Gungnir's an
instrument of death.

35:45.061 --> 35:46.395
Will Thoth allow it?

35:47.855 --> 35:49.565
That...

35:49.732 --> 35:53.236
...my very, very,
very old friend,

35:54.362 --> 35:56.447
is not your motherfucking
concern.

36:00.785 --> 36:02.912
He's gonna need this too.

36:21.514 --> 36:22.765
Leave me.

36:26.310 --> 36:27.645
Choukrane.

36:27.812 --> 36:29.313
Iktomi.

36:56.799 --> 36:58.467
You a fan of catfish?

37:00.011 --> 37:02.263
Uh, fish is fish in my book.

37:02.430 --> 37:05.391
Yeah, I'm pretty sure not
all sushi was created equal.

37:09.437 --> 37:11.314
I will take
your word for it.

37:12.982 --> 37:15.526
So, what's in Cairo?

37:18.779 --> 37:21.240
I gotta find
the Egyptians?

37:22.199 --> 37:23.868
The Egyptians
in Cairo?

37:26.454 --> 37:27.955
I actually know
a place.

37:28.122 --> 37:30.583
It's been there
forever.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.460
I guess sleeping
with the dead

37:32.627 --> 37:34.462
is better than sleeping
with the fishes.

37:37.048 --> 37:38.341
Yeah, well...

37:43.387 --> 37:44.764
What's her name?

37:48.017 --> 37:49.101
Who?

37:50.227 --> 37:51.479
You know who.

37:54.690 --> 37:56.317
Laura.

37:56.484 --> 37:57.818
Mmm.

37:58.861 --> 38:00.613
Yeah, I know a few Lauras.

38:00.780 --> 38:02.698
Every one of them's
been a pain in my ass.

38:06.577 --> 38:08.537
Well, this Laura's dead, but...

38:11.999 --> 38:14.502
I'm just gonna let that
sink in for a minute.

38:16.420 --> 38:20.007
Okay, I got four cats,
two shakes, two fries!

38:26.472 --> 38:29.308
Just a hot second,
new girl.

38:30.434 --> 38:31.894
We need
a plan of attack.

38:32.061 --> 38:34.855
Mm. Man with a plan.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.483
Love it.

38:37.942 --> 38:40.152
- I'm in charge.
- I'll sing backup.

38:40.319 --> 38:44.991
Got it! #NotMe, #You!

38:45.157 --> 38:46.492
Cool.

38:46.659 --> 38:48.077
Follow my lead.

38:48.244 --> 38:50.871
These Old Gods
need special handling.

38:55.584 --> 38:58.212
It is kinda weird that he sent
us both, though, isn't it?

38:58.504 --> 39:00.214
I mean, we're basically...

39:01.090 --> 39:02.216
...redundant.

39:03.926 --> 39:04.969
Hm?

39:05.720 --> 39:06.929
We're different enough.

39:08.097 --> 39:10.433
Different audiences, for sure.

39:11.809 --> 39:13.519
What I really need...

39:15.104 --> 39:16.313
Bandwidth.

39:17.481 --> 39:19.316
You think you
could hook me up?

39:38.544 --> 39:40.254
Dude! You all right?

39:49.346 --> 39:51.682
So, you're going all the way
to New Orleans, then?

39:52.349 --> 39:55.144
Yeah, we're bringing
our message there tonight.

39:55.603 --> 39:58.064
We are just so happy
to have you.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.985
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

40:05.237 --> 40:07.156
♪ Yeah ♪

40:07.323 --> 40:12.369
♪ Now I fully
rely on God ♪

40:12.536 --> 40:14.038
Fuck...

40:14.205 --> 40:19.085
♪ I fully rely on God.
Yeah ♪

40:28.260 --> 40:30.137
I'm really trying

40:30.304 --> 40:31.972
to see things
from your perspective.

40:32.139 --> 40:34.600
Then I remembered that
you're literally fucking blind

40:34.767 --> 40:36.560
so I might have
to spell this out for you.

40:36.727 --> 40:39.063
May I remind you,
one word from me

40:39.230 --> 40:42.399
and you go back to trolling
the Dark Web on IRC bots

40:42.566 --> 40:44.443
and Geocities pages.

40:44.610 --> 40:48.114
The ingratitude.
It hurts me.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.908
How many other Gods
would love the access

40:51.075 --> 40:53.244
that I've given to Mr. World?

40:53.410 --> 40:58.332
No, no, no, no.
That you've given me, Argus.

40:58.874 --> 41:02.545
Me! You're tech, okay?

41:03.045 --> 41:06.507
And tech is my bitch, okay?

41:06.674 --> 41:11.971
That makes you
my fucking bitch, okay?

41:12.138 --> 41:15.975
I need you to do
something I can't.

41:18.269 --> 41:20.563
- I need you to kill him.
- What?

41:20.729 --> 41:22.189
He's been playin'
both sides,

41:22.356 --> 41:24.358
and I need to get him
off the field.

41:24.775 --> 41:27.945
Go for the tattoo on the neck.
That's where the magic is.

41:28.112 --> 41:30.197
He dies,
your coin recharges.

41:30.364 --> 41:32.825
Live to see the future
with Shadow

41:32.992 --> 41:35.703
that you've put so much
unearned faith in.

41:37.079 --> 41:38.497
You're a fucking liar.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.583
I wanna go home now.

41:41.625 --> 41:42.793
All right.

41:43.210 --> 41:44.670
Don't believe me.

41:45.212 --> 41:48.215
But you're still gonna need
a sacrifice to get outta here.

41:51.677 --> 41:53.596
I am not like Shadow.
I see right through you.

41:53.762 --> 41:55.389
I know you're a fucking fraud.

41:55.556 --> 41:57.558
Oh, can't con a con,
is that it?

41:57.725 --> 42:02.479
Well, I did, and you were
such an easy mark, hmm?

42:02.646 --> 42:05.149
You sleepwalked through
your life while you had one.

42:05.316 --> 42:07.568
I had you killed. Now you're
sleepwalking through your death.

42:07.735 --> 42:11.322
It's my hand
up your skirt, puppet.

42:14.450 --> 42:17.369
Because for all that
gaga-goo-goo

42:17.536 --> 42:19.622
about coming back
for love,

42:19.955 --> 42:23.167
I know what makes you tick and
isn't our dearly beloved Shadow.

42:23.334 --> 42:26.754
It's self-interest,
like any other mere mortal.

42:27.922 --> 42:29.715
I'm just making sure that...

42:30.507 --> 42:33.844
...what I'm having you do is
what is right for Laura McCabe.

42:40.768 --> 42:43.854
Entropy leads logically
to disorder.

42:44.021 --> 42:47.566
All systems evolve
towards chaos.

42:47.733 --> 42:50.110
Even alliances with Gods.

42:50.277 --> 42:53.489
Listen to me, you cosmically
inconsequential sack of shit--

42:53.656 --> 42:55.449
Let me handle this.

43:02.498 --> 43:03.874
Hi, big guy.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.085
Nice to meet you.

43:08.295 --> 43:10.339
I don't think
we realized how...

43:10.506 --> 43:12.174
big,

43:12.341 --> 43:15.469
how powerful
your network really is.

43:17.805 --> 43:21.350
Now that I'm here, it occurs
to me that we could,

43:21.517 --> 43:23.435
you know,

43:24.478 --> 43:26.355
do something on our own.

43:34.154 --> 43:36.490
Forget Mr. World.

43:36.657 --> 43:39.702
You're someone who can
handle my demands.

43:40.911 --> 43:44.123
What the fuck, Media?

43:52.548 --> 43:54.591
You would join me?

43:54.758 --> 43:56.176
Leave Mr. World?

43:56.343 --> 43:58.679
I have millions of subscribers.

43:58.846 --> 44:01.557
Thousands of likes and
shares per minute.

44:01.724 --> 44:06.020
Everyone watches me, but I need
someone who can watch them back

44:06.186 --> 44:08.188
We were made for each other.

44:08.355 --> 44:10.232
Connect.

44:11.442 --> 44:14.278
Merge. Be me.

44:15.988 --> 44:17.823
See the world through
the eyes of everyone

44:17.990 --> 44:19.742
who has ever watched me.

44:19.908 --> 44:21.869
Together, we can usher in
the new wave

44:22.036 --> 44:25.873
of synergistic, expansive...

44:26.040 --> 44:30.794
...marketing opportunities.

44:34.006 --> 44:35.382
I can see.

45:01.075 --> 45:02.993
Um, guys...

45:07.289 --> 45:08.499
Never mind.

45:29.603 --> 45:31.230
Your loss,

45:31.397 --> 45:33.482
my gain, you fucking nerd.

45:34.316 --> 45:36.360
I wasn't done.

45:36.527 --> 45:37.820
Come on.

45:38.862 --> 45:41.073
Wednesday's move, am I right?

45:43.033 --> 45:46.495
Tell the old cunt
he's fucking welcome.

45:52.167 --> 45:54.169
Hey, it's done.
You can come out.

45:54.336 --> 45:55.921
Coming!

46:00.092 --> 46:02.052
Nothing's happening.

46:02.219 --> 46:05.556
You are so impatient!

46:06.390 --> 46:08.100
Who the fuck were
those people?

46:08.267 --> 46:09.685
World's people.

46:09.852 --> 46:12.146
I told you he'd gone
over to the other side.

46:13.313 --> 46:14.606
Wednesday.

46:16.066 --> 46:20.946
Well, I am so sorry,
Argus, my old friend.

46:21.321 --> 46:24.032
This war business,
nothing personal.

46:24.199 --> 46:26.535
But I'm sure
you'll come back somehow.

46:26.702 --> 46:29.288
And just remember when you do,
which side you're on.

46:53.729 --> 46:55.981
Well, lookie here.

46:56.148 --> 46:58.901
I guess it wasn't
all about Shadow, after all.

47:01.445 --> 47:03.739
Now, that should hold
the rot for a while

47:03.906 --> 47:06.116
and that makes us
square. So...

47:07.910 --> 47:09.495
Ciao, baby.

47:09.661 --> 47:11.663
I'm, I'm coming with you.

47:11.830 --> 47:13.457
Why?

47:14.249 --> 47:16.210
- Shadow.
- No, no, no.

47:16.376 --> 47:18.795
You can't come back, not after
everything you've been through.

47:18.962 --> 47:20.547
No, no, no, no, no.

47:20.714 --> 47:23.634
Your dead little
heartbeat and Shadow

47:23.800 --> 47:25.761
had fuck all to do with it!

47:25.928 --> 47:27.638
And what a mercy that is, huh?

47:27.804 --> 47:29.640
He doesn't love the girl
that wants to be alive

47:29.806 --> 47:31.725
and will kill to get
what she wants, no.

47:31.892 --> 47:34.728
He loved the girl that tried
to off herself with bug spray.

47:34.895 --> 47:36.897
And that girl...

47:38.190 --> 47:40.359
...well, she doesn't exist
anymore, does she?

47:41.235 --> 47:43.904
Oh, I just love a happy ending.

47:44.655 --> 47:49.368
Goodbye and good luck,
Miss Laura McCabe Moon.

48:17.604 --> 48:19.147
It's funny.

48:23.193 --> 48:25.195
A lot of my dreams
are nightmares.

48:29.032 --> 48:31.618
Buffalos and skulls and...

48:34.413 --> 48:36.164
...all kinds of weird shit.

48:39.459 --> 48:41.211
I just don't understand.

48:44.256 --> 48:46.800
Well, good luck with that.

48:49.261 --> 48:52.848
Yeah. I don't want luck.

48:57.686 --> 48:59.396
I want peace.

49:05.110 --> 49:07.863
My father was
a full-blood Cherokee,

49:08.030 --> 49:10.240
and he called me a half-breed.

49:11.575 --> 49:14.661
My mother raised me
with the Bible by her side.

49:17.331 --> 49:19.166
There was
no peace for me.

49:19.333 --> 49:21.251
Not in their worlds.

49:23.920 --> 49:29.051
But I found my home
in the stories of my ancestors.

49:32.179 --> 49:33.388
Keep searching...

49:37.142 --> 49:38.477
...or give up.

50:30.946 --> 50:33.532
Hey. I never did
catch your name.

50:35.492 --> 50:36.827
I'm Shadow Moon.

50:39.162 --> 50:40.664
Sam Blackcurl.

51:03.395 --> 51:05.105
Friends of yours?

52:06.249 --> 52:08.001
Shadow Moon.

52:09.711 --> 52:11.129
Well, look at you.

52:13.089 --> 52:15.175
Trial and tribulation
make you stronger,

52:15.342 --> 52:18.845
but you look like
you have been through it.

52:21.932 --> 52:23.642
So, this is
how it's gonna go.

52:26.394 --> 52:28.271
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

52:29.773 --> 52:31.525
And you're gonna give me
some answers.

52:33.860 --> 52:38.573
Revelations come when ready,
not when requested.

52:39.533 --> 52:40.659
Fine.

52:41.618 --> 52:43.411
Then just tell me why.

52:43.578 --> 52:45.539
Can you just,

52:45.705 --> 52:48.625
just tell me why these sadistic
motherfuckers are after me?

52:48.792 --> 52:51.211
Oh, could be your face,
could be your shoes. Who knows?

52:51.378 --> 52:53.547
All I know is that,
in the morning,

52:53.713 --> 52:56.550
you're gonna wake up
and wanna seize the day.

52:57.175 --> 52:59.469
No, Shadow, listen.
Listen to me.

53:01.513 --> 53:03.181
If you don't wake up
in the morning

53:03.348 --> 53:05.058
feeling like a million bucks,

53:06.101 --> 53:09.062
you can take Betty
and leave, with my blessing.

53:11.273 --> 53:12.315
