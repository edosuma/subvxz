<i>Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:03.438 --> 00:04.874
The Phantoms attack
with Fear Visions.

00:04.917 --> 00:06.310
Use grounding techniques.

00:06.354 --> 00:09.313
You start by naming things
that you know are real.

00:09.357 --> 00:12.012
Without my mom,
all I have are questions.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.362
Like there's
a whole part of yourself
you'll never understand?

00:14.405 --> 00:17.843
You are Alex Danvers.
Remember what's real.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.456
Kelpies are a myth. Mother.

00:21.499 --> 00:24.546
You are free
of the Phantom's powers.
You all did it!

00:24.589 --> 00:28.941
I was naive to think
that I could ever
actually fix anything.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.073
You fixed me.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.644
That's my family.
They're really here!

00:41.650 --> 00:44.087
Eagle One,
the package is in hand.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.871
<i>Return to the Tower,
immediately.</i>

00:45.915 --> 00:47.264
<i>The Golden Sleeper is stirring.</i>

01:00.495 --> 01:02.366
Hey, buddy,
what are you doing?

01:13.769 --> 01:16.076
-Am I late?
-Thank you.

01:16.119 --> 01:18.774
-Did I miss it?
-No, you're right on time.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.693
The cake is intact.

01:25.389 --> 01:26.738
Where's Supergirl?

01:26.782 --> 01:28.349
She's still
under the sun lamps.

01:28.392 --> 01:29.698
Getting through
the Phantom Zone

01:29.741 --> 01:31.178
to the Tower last night
took all her strength.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.396
You told me
the clock was ticking.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.267
Uh...

01:34.355 --> 01:37.749
Uh... we thought
you'd eat the cake.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.099
You thought I would
eat the cake?

01:39.142 --> 01:40.926
What am I? An animal?
I would never!

01:40.970 --> 01:43.190
I want things to be perfect
for when Supergirl wakes up.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.148
Let's not rush her.

01:45.192 --> 01:48.108
Hopefully, she's having
the first restful night
she's had in a while.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.117
Hey. Hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.554
It was just a nightmare, okay?

01:59.597 --> 02:03.340
It was so dark and horrible.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.429
Was it about the Phantom Zone?

02:05.473 --> 02:08.432
I don't...
I don't want to talk about it.

02:08.476 --> 02:10.652
No, no, no,
y-y-you don't have to, okay?

02:10.695 --> 02:13.742
It's, it's all over.
We've got you. I've got you.

02:18.094 --> 02:19.835
It's all behind us now.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.880
Good.

02:21.924 --> 02:26.537
Oh, 'cause I don't think
I ever wanna hear
the word "Phantom" ever again.

02:26.581 --> 02:30.454
Not in an opera,
not in a <i>Star Wars</i> prequel.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.848
Especially, not in
a <i>Star Wars</i> prequel.

02:32.891 --> 02:36.156
I don't even think
I could handle an episode
of <i>Scooby-Doo</i> right now.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.418
It's...

02:39.855 --> 02:41.465
I'm sorry.

02:41.509 --> 02:44.816
It's so good to have you home.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.472
Now, uh, come on.
You've got some folks
that are waiting to see you.

02:48.516 --> 02:51.649
-Alex?
-Yeah?

02:51.693 --> 02:55.349
-Can I have
another hug, please?
-Always.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.677
Oh, Brainy.

03:19.721 --> 03:23.377

thinking we might
not ever see you again...

03:24.465 --> 03:27.294

Well, um, apologies from Kelly,
she really wishes
she could be here,

03:58.586 --> 04:01.110
but she had a full day
of orientation
at Social Services.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.068
It's okay.

04:03.808 --> 04:04.896

Father.

04:06.811 --> 04:09.901
-How long have you been awake?
-Not long.

04:09.945 --> 04:13.035
Just long enough to try out
the perks of your yellow sun.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.558
A man can get used to flying.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.560
Oh, wait until I teach you

04:16.604 --> 04:19.607
-Cold coffee? Not anymore.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.393
I also had a minute
to check out this headquarters.

04:23.437 --> 04:25.134
Very Impressive, J'onn.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.397
The technology here
dwarfs what we had on Krypton.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.530
-Hmm.
-We could have used
a man like you.

04:29.573 --> 04:34.622
Thank you. We're lucky enough
to draw on a variety
of alien technology here.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.232
I am eternally grateful.

04:36.276 --> 04:40.149
My daughter has such smart,
innovative, heroic friends.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.934
I am in your debt.

04:42.978 --> 04:46.547
-I'm just glad
we found each other.
-It really is a miracle.

04:46.590 --> 04:51.029
Not many people get to reunite
with lost loved ones
after so long.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.815
And in the Phantom Zone,
no less.

04:56.470 --> 05:01.301
Uh, Zor-El, I'm sure that Alura
would be overjoyed to know
that you're still alive.

05:01.344 --> 05:04.042
Yes, you must be anxious
to get back to Argo City.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.827
I am, of course.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.568
But before I go,

05:07.611 --> 05:08.743
I'd like to see
what my daughter's been up to
here on Earth.

05:08.786 --> 05:11.006
I think that can be arranged.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.751
Okay, so, remember,

05:16.794 --> 05:21.233
you are my Uncle Archie,
visiting from Midvale. Okay.

05:21.277 --> 05:24.976
Don't worry. I promise no one
will even know I'm there.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.588
I'm starting to understand
my strength.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.460
I'm, I'm sorry about your door.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.810
No, no.
It's not that, I'm just...

05:32.854 --> 05:34.899
I'm just nervous, you know?

05:34.943 --> 05:36.597
I disappeared without a trace,

05:36.640 --> 05:39.251
I'm surprised
I still even have a job.

05:39.295 --> 05:43.430
And William, I left him hanging
without so much as a good bye.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.301
Oh. Don't worry about him,

05:45.345 --> 05:46.607
it's not like
you chose to get...

05:49.523 --> 05:51.307
He'll understand.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.744
And don't worry
about Andrea, okay?
I covered for you, remember?

05:53.788 --> 05:55.833
Right. Uh, what did you
tell her exactly?

05:55.877 --> 05:57.792
That Cat Grant reached out
to you personally

05:57.835 --> 06:00.664
to do a profile
on Darien resistance leader
Miguel de Miranda.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.057
Okay.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.493
And that you've been off-grid,
imbedded with him.

06:03.537 --> 06:04.712
-Wait, what?

06:04.755 --> 06:05.930
It was
the best I could do.

06:05.974 --> 06:09.804
-I was--
-Hi. Andrea,
good morning. Um...

06:10.979 --> 06:13.547
Coffee cart.
Best part of CatCo.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.418
Come on, Uncle Archie.
Bye, Kara.

06:15.462 --> 06:19.204
-Hi, Andrea.
-Kara Danvers. Welcome back.

06:19.248 --> 06:21.424
-Thank you.
-Nia told me
what you've been cooking up,

06:21.468 --> 06:24.209
-and well,
I smell another Pulitzer.
-Oh.

06:24.253 --> 06:26.037
And that's gonna be
great for business.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.865
I can't wait
to read it immediately.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.215
Well, uh, I'm not
exactly done with it yet.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.869
Of course.
End of the day, then.

06:31.913 --> 06:35.917
That's the weird thing, though.
There is no story.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.311
-What?
-Yeah, Mirando...

06:39.355 --> 06:41.879
Miranda changed his mind...

06:41.923 --> 06:43.315
at the last minute.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.883
He said he would
take everything off the record,

06:45.927 --> 06:47.407
he would deny everything.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.452
The funny thing
about these resistance leaders,

06:49.496 --> 06:53.325
they think they want fame,
but their lives
depend on secrecy.

06:53.369 --> 06:56.807
-You know, it's--
-Well, that is disappointing.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.593
Kara, you're late
for the staff meeting.

07:05.599 --> 07:10.125
Uncle Archie insisted on
reading all your old articles.
It's adorable.

07:11.561 --> 07:14.999
Good, we're all here.
Finally.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.697
Can anyone tell me
what this is?

07:16.740 --> 07:19.482
It's the current
media tracker's latest ranking

07:19.526 --> 07:21.223
of the top ten news outlets
in the country.

07:21.266 --> 07:24.748
Yes.
And CatCo is number eight.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.620
Number eight!

07:26.663 --> 07:29.405
Does anybody know
what else ranked number eight?

07:30.754 --> 07:32.626
No, you don't.

07:32.669 --> 07:35.455
Because no one ever
remembers number eight.

07:35.498 --> 07:38.022
Look, I know
that our reputation took a hit

07:38.066 --> 07:42.897
after our little slip-upcovering the Lex Luthor trial...

07:42.940 --> 07:45.290
but we must do better.

07:45.334 --> 07:48.990
CatCo had the tradition
of being the go-to news source.

07:49.033 --> 07:53.385
Trusted and respected.
We need more breaking news.

07:53.429 --> 07:55.475
More hard-hitting journalism.

07:55.518 --> 08:01.611
We must rebuild.
Find new sources, dig deeper.

08:01.655 --> 08:05.615
We will be number one
by the end
of next month's ranking...

08:05.659 --> 08:07.356
or I will get a new staff.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.618
Am I clear?

08:09.532 --> 08:11.795
Good. Now, back to work.

08:13.971 --> 08:15.625
Kara.

08:15.669 --> 08:19.107
I have been shockingly patient
with your long absence,

08:19.150 --> 08:23.154
which resulted in
exactly zero stories,
so, you owe me.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.026
I want you to call Supergirl.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.593
I want an exclusive with her

08:26.636 --> 08:29.509
about how she stopped
the National City
Phantom attacks.

08:29.552 --> 08:32.512
The... the what?

08:32.555 --> 08:35.297
The Phantom attacks.
And I want a whole series.

08:35.340 --> 08:39.040
Interviews with Supergirl
and everyone who was
turned into a Phantom.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.651
Here's a list of the victims,
and I want all the details.

08:41.695 --> 08:44.001
Don't let them skip
a single thing, okay?

08:44.045 --> 08:45.655
-Okay.
-Thanks.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.095
Why did no one tell me
that Phantoms
attacked National City?

08:52.706 --> 08:55.404
-Alex didn't want us
to burden you.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.885
She knew you'd be worried,
and for no reason.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.887
The Phantom is gone,
this is in the past.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.498
Yeah, but how did it
even get here?

09:02.542 --> 09:09.287
We... sort of released it...
the first time we tried
to rescue you.

09:09.331 --> 09:12.987
So, all these people
suffered because of me?

09:13.030 --> 09:14.641
No. Kara, no.

09:14.684 --> 09:18.253
It is Lex's fault.
He is the one
that sent you there.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.083
Yeah, it, uh...

09:22.126 --> 09:25.347
It doesn't matter.
Like you said, that's over.
It's done now.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.131
So, I'll go talk to Andrea.

09:30.352 --> 09:33.790
And I will go
talk to Uncle Archie

09:33.834 --> 09:37.315
and remind him
that humans cannot lift
800 pounds of machinery.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.186
Oh...

09:39.317 --> 09:41.363
-Oh, dear.
-Welcome back, Kara.

09:41.406 --> 09:43.017
William.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.368
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:46.411 --> 09:50.415
Look, I'm really sorry
that I left
without saying goodbye,

09:50.459 --> 09:53.462
or without even
giving you a call. I...

09:53.505 --> 09:55.769
-I had to go undercover--
-Kara.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.248
You do not owe me an apology.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.946
When we first met,
I was undercover. I get it.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.078
Of course you do.

10:02.689 --> 10:06.170
Hey, we should get coffee
after work, catch up.

10:06.214 --> 10:10.522
I'd love to,
but I have plans. Um...

10:10.566 --> 10:14.352
I've been seeing someone,
her name's Mary,
she's a pediatrician.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.354
We actually met
at a charity bake-off.

10:16.398 --> 10:19.314
Her apricot couronne
very narrowly beat
my famous banoffee pie.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.796
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm. Well deserved,
I must say.

10:22.839 --> 10:26.190
That's wonderful.
I'm really happy
for you, William.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.062
Thank you.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.759
-But coffee soon.
-Yes.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.588
I know you can't divulge much
about the secret profile,

10:32.632 --> 10:35.156
but I must hear
some of the details.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.898
-Okay.
-It's good to have you back.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.553
<i>There was
a moment in there,</i>

10:41.597 --> 10:45.383
when I could hear
the other side of ten
different phone conversations.

10:45.427 --> 10:48.169
These powers are... intense.

10:48.212 --> 10:50.519
It takes time.

10:50.562 --> 10:53.261
Especially, when your powers
come to you all at once.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.915
And without a manual.

11:04.315 --> 11:06.274
What a difference a sun makes.

11:08.929 --> 11:09.973
What is that?

11:12.019 --> 11:13.977
Something has broken through
the Earth's atmosphere.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.980
Looks like
a large piece of machinery.

11:17.024 --> 11:19.504
It's speeding towards us.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.681
You really wanna see
what Kara's life is like?

11:21.724 --> 11:23.639
Suit up and get ready to fly.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.085
J'onn, I've got eyes
on the satellite.

11:35.129 --> 11:39.176
<i>Do you need backup?
-No, we've got this.</i>

11:52.189 --> 11:55.366
-I'll go get it.
-Try your freeze breath.

12:14.472 --> 12:17.780
Nice job.
Thanks for
the suggestion.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.913
I also X-rayed
the garbage patch.

12:19.956 --> 12:22.045
It was covered
in toxic chemicals.

12:22.089 --> 12:25.657
Looks like we have Luthor Corp
and the former DEO
to thank for that.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.020
<i>While we've seen upswings</i>

12:40.063 --> 12:42.587
<i>for</i> The Times <i>
and the</i> Daily Planet <i>
this quarter,</i>

12:42.631 --> 12:45.416
<i>there's been
a major downward trend
for CatCo Media.</i>

12:45.460 --> 12:48.245
Andrea. Is this a bad time?

12:48.289 --> 12:51.901
I just got a lead on a major
environmental disaster story.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.773
As it relates to Phantoms?

12:53.816 --> 12:55.818
No, a thousand miles
off the coast of National City,

12:55.862 --> 12:58.429
there is a literal island
of garbage.

12:58.473 --> 13:02.607
Kara, that's hardly news,
there's garbage masses
in every ocean.

13:02.651 --> 13:07.438
Right, yes, but this one was
hit by a neglected satellite
today, and caught fire

13:07.482 --> 13:12.313
because this garbage island
has heavy amounts of debris

13:12.356 --> 13:16.839
illegally dumped
by multiple corporations,
including the DEO.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.188
You mean Lex caused this?

13:20.147 --> 13:23.019
William?

13:23.063 --> 13:25.326
I want you to go investigate
this trash island fire

13:25.369 --> 13:27.632
as it relates to Lex Luthor
and his misdeeds.

13:27.676 --> 13:28.938
-Me?
-Him?

13:28.982 --> 13:32.637
Yes. This is the one-two punch
the paper needs.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.944
Two Pulitzer-winning writers
combating crises,

13:34.988 --> 13:36.859
both frightening and domestic.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.339
Not only will we focus

13:38.382 --> 13:40.645
on local security and safety
with the Phantom story,

13:40.689 --> 13:44.040
but also,
we continue exposing Lex

13:44.084 --> 13:46.173
for the global threat
that he is.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.566
William, you still have
contacts at Luthor Corp, right?

13:48.610 --> 13:50.264
Yes, but I've been
having trouble

13:50.307 --> 13:52.353
getting them to disclose
anything since the trial.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.876
Well, make them talk.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.139
Just don't tell me about it.
Plausible deniability.

13:56.183 --> 13:59.403
Andrea, I really think that
because I brought
the trash island story,

13:59.447 --> 14:01.623
and I really should be
the one to cover it--

14:01.666 --> 14:07.716
Kara, every single news source
currently outranking us
is still covering the story.

14:07.759 --> 14:13.287
But thanks to your connections,
CatCo has something
no one else has.

14:13.330 --> 14:17.552
Supergirl. No one has been able
to sit down with her.

14:17.595 --> 14:20.903
You can get us back on top.

14:20.947 --> 14:24.733
Unless for some reason,
you have a problem
covering the Phantoms?

14:26.213 --> 14:29.520
No. No, of course not.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.000
Great.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.549
<i>Kara.</i>

14:58.593 --> 15:02.118
<i>Kara. It's me, your dad.</i>

15:02.162 --> 15:05.034
Uncle Archie?
What is it?

15:05.078 --> 15:08.168
After you told me of
Earth's environmental crisis,

15:08.211 --> 15:09.604
I couldn't shake the feeling

15:09.647 --> 15:12.259
that Earth was headed down
the same path as Krypton.

15:12.302 --> 15:16.437
So, I analyzed your oceans,
and I'm afraid
the prognosis is grim.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.396
Your oceans are dying,
just like ours did.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.007
I know, Father.

15:21.050 --> 15:24.967
And I understand your fears,
but it's not just our oceans.

15:25.011 --> 15:29.058
We've been trying to manage
Earth's environmental crises
for years...

15:29.102 --> 15:31.278
but it's... it's complicated.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.193
Supergirl,
I'm glad you're here.

15:33.236 --> 15:36.065
I'm afraid the fire
from this morning
has reignited.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.286
We had it contained.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.331
The fuel leak
is coming from
a Dominator Warp Drive.

15:41.375 --> 15:45.031
Brainy and I can break it down
on the molecular level,
rendering it inert.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.946
That should put the fire out.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.774
That should have been done
during the cleanup
after the DEO imploded.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.124
I'm not surprised it wasn't.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.996
Men like Lex
all ascribe to the same motto.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.347
"Cheaper, faster, easier,"
no matter the damage.

15:57.391 --> 16:00.002
Neglect like this
is what destroyed Krypton.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.178
The death of the oceans,
that was the tipping point.

16:02.222 --> 16:05.225
And you're already here.
We have to stop it.

16:05.268 --> 16:09.011
This doesn't have an easy fix,
it's a complicated problem.

16:09.055 --> 16:12.710
Of course.
But if I could access
Krypton's records,

16:12.754 --> 16:15.061
I could really compare
the data and analysis.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.106
Maybe there's something
I missed on Krypton.

16:19.500 --> 16:23.765
Kara, the pod we used
to send you to Earth.
Do you still have it?

16:23.808 --> 16:26.637
It should have retained data
from your launch date.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.814
Actually, I have something
a lot better.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.996
Welcome to Krypton on Earth.

16:45.439 --> 16:49.138
Hey, Lena, have you seen Kara?
I know Zor-El
asked her back here,

16:49.182 --> 16:50.835
but Andrea's
asking about her article,

16:50.879 --> 16:52.620
and she's not
picking up her phone.

16:52.663 --> 16:55.840
That is because she
and Zor-El went to
the Fortress of Solitude.

16:57.799 --> 17:01.020
That's really great
that they get to share that.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.760
Wait, Nia.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.198
How are you doing?

17:06.199 --> 17:07.852
I'm fine.

17:07.896 --> 17:11.856
I-I know Kara and her father
coming back must be hard.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.511
After everything
we talked about
on the way to the Phantom Zone,

17:14.555 --> 17:17.036
I know how much
you must miss your mother.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.953
I'm really happy for Kara.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.695
Really, I am, it's just...

17:24.739 --> 17:27.046
Reminds you of all the things
you missed out on?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.395
Yeah.

17:28.438 --> 17:29.787
You know I get it.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.616
I know.

17:34.575 --> 17:37.143
Lena, I would do anything
to have another day
with my mom.

17:40.407 --> 17:43.236
I would do anything
to just know my mom.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.718
You know,
my Phantom Fear Vision
was about her?

17:47.762 --> 17:51.766
The water monster?
Did you conquer it?

17:51.809 --> 17:55.944
Didn't we all? Isn't that how
we defeated the Phantoms?

17:55.987 --> 18:00.383
Right. But, I mean,
how did you defeat it?

18:03.169 --> 18:08.826
I let it overtake me, and...
the Kelpie
turned into my mother.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.698
What do you think it means?

18:10.741 --> 18:13.135
I don't know,
you're the dream expert here.

18:13.179 --> 18:17.183
No, no, that's different.
This is personal to you.

18:17.226 --> 18:21.100
But you'll figure it out.
And I'm here
to help any way I can.

18:27.976 --> 18:31.153
I remember when your aunt
and uncle made the plan
for this place.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.591
I just didn't think
it was possible.

18:34.635 --> 18:38.160
Yeah, Kal-El tried to get me
to come here for years.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.206
I thought it would
make me homesick.

18:40.249 --> 18:44.123
That it would be too painful
to face all those memories.

18:45.254 --> 18:48.692
I can understand that.

18:52.653 --> 18:57.223
I am so sorry, Kara.
I should have done more
to save our planet.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.790
You did everything you could.

18:59.834 --> 19:04.621
You sacrificed yourself
to save us.
You were a hero, Father.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.147
I ripped you from your home.

19:08.190 --> 19:11.933
And I found a new one. Here.

19:11.976 --> 19:16.416
And I promise you.
This time, I will save it.

19:16.459 --> 19:19.070
I will not let what happened
to Krypton happen here.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.988
If Kal-El is anything
like his father,

19:24.032 --> 19:26.339
all of Krypton's records
should be stored in here.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.700
Kara! No!

19:42.703 --> 19:44.661
Kara, are you okay?

19:45.314 --> 19:46.402
Yes.

19:48.230 --> 19:52.191
I'm just surprised
that everything's
still in order after--

19:52.234 --> 19:55.890
Of course it is.
That's what I'm here for.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.326
You have a Kelex!

19:59.067 --> 20:02.026
Kelex, my father is looking for
scientific data about Krypton.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.681
Specifically, from the time
right before
the planet exploded.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.727
I will pull up
everything I have.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.904
Kara...

20:11.384 --> 20:13.908
I think I know
how to save your oceans.

20:16.084 --> 20:20.001
"Determining who's
responsible for these
so-called garbage islands

20:20.044 --> 20:23.526
proves just as messy
as cleaning up
the islands themselves."

20:23.570 --> 20:25.572
You sound like
a human sleep-aid.

20:25.615 --> 20:28.749
-What happened to
the Luthor Corp angle?

20:28.792 --> 20:32.361
We know Lex's mismanagement
of the DEO
is responsible for this.

20:32.405 --> 20:33.971
We actually don't.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.060
When I finally got
my Luthor Corp source
on the phone,

20:36.104 --> 20:39.673
he said Lex had hired
a third party to
dispose of the DEO waste.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.109
And it wasn't even illegal.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.938
They exploited a loophole
in government regulations.

20:43.981 --> 20:46.245
If anything, the system's
to blame for the fire.

20:46.288 --> 20:51.075
The unseen toxicity of Lex
is the fire. Figure it out.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.481
The fire is 100% contained.

21:05.525 --> 21:08.658
Good. I am running a scan
on that garbage mass.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.312
Just cataloguing
what other DEO remnants

21:10.356 --> 21:12.532
might not have
been properly disposed of.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.882
I can only imagine
how long that list is gonna be.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.930
Hey, how was the Fortress?

21:19.974 --> 21:23.194
I mean, since you've been back.
Are you okay?

21:23.238 --> 21:25.806
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.764
But this planet isn't.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.679
At the Fortress,
we ran a full comparison

21:29.723 --> 21:33.379
of Earth's oceanic readings
to Krypton's
just before it exploded.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.468
As I thought,

21:35.511 --> 21:37.818
your oceans' toxicity levels
have put Earth in the same
trajectory as Krypton.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.254
But perhaps, he can help.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.826
This is Oscar.

21:45.869 --> 21:51.658
Looks like Kelex,
just with some ugly
'80s style shoulder pads.

21:51.701 --> 21:56.315
It was Kelex, but my father
figured out a way
to add some modifications

21:56.358 --> 21:59.100
that will enable him to clean
Earth's oceans right now.

21:59.143 --> 22:01.450
-Is Oscar an acronym?
-Oh, no. He's named

22:01.494 --> 22:04.323
after that irritable
green creature who lives
with the garbage.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.281
Yes, he binge-watched <i>
Sesame Street</i>

22:06.325 --> 22:08.152
while I was recovering
under the sun lamps.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.285
Crash course in Earth customs.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.243
Did you upgrade him
with Coluan technology?

22:12.287 --> 22:14.333
I would hardly
call it an upgrade.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.291
I...

22:16.335 --> 22:18.075
I attached
a Coluan energy core,

22:18.119 --> 22:21.296
so Oscar can shrink trash
and convert it
into energy in seconds.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.168
Oscar will then
absorb that energy,
rendering it harmless.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.831
Okay. I will admit that
that is very impressive.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.834
But the Earth
is covered in 70% water.

22:37.878 --> 22:40.315
Do you really think
that Oscar can handle that?

22:40.359 --> 22:43.971
Yes. And this is something
I could never have
achieved on Krypton.

22:44.014 --> 22:45.799
Your planet has
an amazing melting pot

22:45.842 --> 22:48.584
of alien technology that we
never had access to on Krypton.

22:48.628 --> 22:51.152
That's what concerns me.

22:51.195 --> 22:54.416
Some alien technology
interacts poorly with others.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.158
-Plus, I saw Kryptonite
out there.
-Kryptonite?

22:57.201 --> 23:01.031
Yes, but you must have been
too far away from the garbage
to feel its effect.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.251
But that's my point.
We don't know the full scope

23:03.294 --> 23:05.514
of the garbage
on those islands.

23:05.558 --> 23:06.776
We should run
a full system check

23:06.820 --> 23:08.865
before we release
Zor-El's invention.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.084
I understand
your concern.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.738
I wish I could give you
an exact timeline

23:11.781 --> 23:14.218
of when Earth will reach
Krypton's tipping point.

23:14.262 --> 23:15.611
But that's the thing.

23:15.655 --> 23:18.397
Once you can see
the tipping point,
it's too late.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.747
That's why we need to act now.

23:23.750 --> 23:27.406
Okay. But I want him recalled
at the first sign of distress.

23:28.494 --> 23:29.625
Of course.

23:50.994 --> 23:53.344
-It's working.
-So it would seem.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.130
Brainy?

23:56.173 --> 23:59.350
Uh, Oscar is converting
the garbage
even more efficiently

23:59.394 --> 24:02.658
than Zor-El's model suggested.

24:02.702 --> 24:05.487
I apologize for my skepticism.

24:05.531 --> 24:08.838
That's not necessary.
I'm just happy
I'm able to help.

24:13.060 --> 24:16.150
No, they can't pull their ads.
We're turning things around.

24:16.193 --> 24:18.239
-You... Tell them.

24:21.764 --> 24:22.939
Let me call you back.

24:55.581 --> 24:59.236
William's source
was telling the truth.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.675
There's got to be
something here.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.513
Jackpot.

25:28.701 --> 25:30.180
What is it?

25:30.224 --> 25:34.184
Getting some odd fluctuations
in Oscar's energy core.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.404
His mass is increasing, too.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.537
He seems to be adding garbage
to his body,

25:38.580 --> 25:39.842
not converting it to energy.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.148
We need to bring him back.

25:41.191 --> 25:42.410
I'll recall him.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.023
I've issued the return command,
but he's not responding.

25:57.468 --> 25:58.644
I'll go get him.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.297
-Brainy, the coordinates?
-I've lost him.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.648
Visuals are gone, and he's
disappeared off the radar.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.258
There are major shipping lanes
in that area.

26:04.301 --> 26:07.217
If Oscar malfunctions,
he could endanger cargo ships.

26:07.261 --> 26:08.567
Try satellite imaging.

26:09.872 --> 26:12.396
There's no trace of him.
He's gone.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.876
J'onn and I will find him.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.617
Brainy, you stay here
with my father,

26:15.661 --> 26:17.967
figure out what went wrong
and how to fix it.

26:18.011 --> 26:19.403
Don't forget,
there's Kryptonite.

26:27.934 --> 26:30.240
-You lost a radioactive Kelex?
-Oscar.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.460
Supergirl and J'onn are out
scanning for him right now.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.897
We're looking for anything
that he might have absorbed

26:34.941 --> 26:36.464
that would
corrupt his programming,

26:36.507 --> 26:37.813
and make him disappear.

26:39.728 --> 26:40.947
The DEO
had Daxamite tech?

26:42.601 --> 26:43.645
-Yeah.
-That might explain

26:43.689 --> 26:44.733
his new cloaking abilities.

26:44.777 --> 26:46.169
I have some experience
with that.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.388
I should be
able to de-cloak him

26:47.431 --> 26:49.912
by sending out
a signal wave blast.

26:49.956 --> 26:52.785
Zor-El, you used
Coluan shrinking tech. Smart.

26:52.828 --> 26:55.526
I did something similar
with a high-pressure
energy compactor

26:55.570 --> 26:56.919
at L-Corp.

26:56.963 --> 26:59.879
It's a attractive idea,
but a delicate process.

26:59.922 --> 27:03.447
Shrinking energy
doesn't get rid of it.
It still has to go somewhere.

27:03.491 --> 27:07.060
That energy
is what powers Oscar.
He's self-sufficient.

27:07.103 --> 27:10.106
Unless he's been compromised
by one of my brother's
unholy experiments.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.720
That's Oscar's
Coluan energy core.
Why is it red?

27:14.763 --> 27:16.635
All that energy
has overloaded him.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.114
If it gets any higher,
it's going to detonate

27:18.158 --> 27:19.725
with the force
of an atomic bomb.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.291
We have to find him.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.250
-His trail's gone cold.

27:23.293 --> 27:25.905
A cold. That's it.
That's how we can reset him.

27:25.948 --> 27:28.429
We give him a virus.
A computer virus.

27:28.472 --> 27:29.691
Brainy, that's genius.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.606
If we can't restore
Oscar's programming,

27:31.650 --> 27:33.782
we can give him a virus
and shut him down completely.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.305
I know Kelex's
operating frequencies,

27:35.349 --> 27:37.046
so we just need
to get the virus

27:37.090 --> 27:38.918
within a few centimeters
of his hard drive
for it to take effect.

27:38.961 --> 27:40.136
I can deliver it with a drone.

27:40.180 --> 27:41.660
But a virus will destroy Oscar.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.314
If we don't destroy him,
he will destroy us.

27:44.358 --> 27:47.535
No! I can still fix him!
He can still save Krypton!

27:53.497 --> 27:57.893
Earth. He can still save Earth.

27:57.937 --> 28:00.330
My signal wave blast
is nearly complete.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.158
Oscar should be
de-cloaking any second.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.551
Brainy, get that virus ready.

28:03.594 --> 28:04.726
-Wait.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.815
No, we don't
have time to wait.

28:06.859 --> 28:09.992
You heard Lena.
This thing could
explode at any minute,

28:10.036 --> 28:12.560
killing hundreds
of thousands of people.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.737
Look, I know that you wanted
to help. I get that.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.174
But we have to
shut this robot down now

28:18.218 --> 28:21.700
before he does
any more damage. So...

28:21.743 --> 28:25.225
all due respect,
but you either help Brainy
with the virus,

28:25.268 --> 28:26.748
or you step aside.

28:33.059 --> 28:35.888
I altered
Kelex's programming frequency
when I made the upgrades.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.237
Let me show you.

28:39.326 --> 28:41.154
When Oscar reappears,
we need to be ready.

29:12.315 --> 29:13.708
My God.

29:14.970 --> 29:17.843
You said he bonded
with the trash, but this...

29:17.886 --> 29:19.714
He's picked up a Teallian
along the way.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.672
Lex must have brought one
to the DEO.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.326
It's a parasitic creature
that forces

29:23.370 --> 29:25.807
even inanimate objects
to adapt to survive.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.462
It's impossible to remove
once it's attached to a host.

29:28.505 --> 29:30.769
So, now,
Oscar's protecting the garbage.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.466
His Coluan energy core
is spiking.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.511
If that detonates,
the atomic blast
is going to spread inland.

29:34.555 --> 29:37.514
Copy that. Dreamer and I will
evacuate the civilians.

29:37.558 --> 29:39.908
Brainy, launch that drone, now.

29:42.693 --> 29:44.043
Sprock.

29:44.086 --> 29:45.871
Lena, I lost the drone
with the virus in it.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.524
<i>-Can you recall it?
-Standby.</i>

29:49.265 --> 29:51.964
<i>Brainy, I'm trying,
but I can't control it.</i>

29:52.007 --> 29:56.142
-I think we can grab the drone.
-Wait. I did a psychic scan.

29:56.185 --> 29:58.231
Oscar is protected
by a force field.

29:58.274 --> 30:00.189
He must have acquired it
from the DEO tech.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.235
And trying to breach it
could cause a backlash.

30:02.278 --> 30:04.759
Brainy, that force field
is keeping me
from accessing the drone.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.326
<i>You've to find
a way to get close enough</i>

30:06.369 --> 30:08.197
to the drone
to release the virus manually.

30:08.241 --> 30:09.372
On it.

30:09.416 --> 30:10.591
How will you
get close enough?

30:10.634 --> 30:12.636
I need to get him
to think I'm trash.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.943
Kelex!

30:14.987 --> 30:17.511
Kelex, you stupid idiot!
Can you hear me?

30:18.947 --> 30:20.035
Wow!

30:20.079 --> 30:21.863
Look how big and dumb you are!

30:23.734 --> 30:26.302
A junkyard? Come on!

30:26.346 --> 30:29.001
You sorry excuse for a Roomba!

30:29.044 --> 30:30.524
I know you know the truth.

30:30.567 --> 30:34.833
Without that Coluan power core,
you're nothing!

30:38.532 --> 30:40.490
I regret nothing!

30:40.534 --> 30:42.275
-We need to help him.

30:43.319 --> 30:44.407
<i>Brainy, are you okay?</i>

30:44.451 --> 30:45.669
I'm shifting
through trash.

30:45.713 --> 30:47.106
Just a little further to Kelex.

30:51.414 --> 30:53.590
-Supergirl!

30:53.634 --> 30:55.462
Supergirl, that is
a Teallian proto-ray.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.072
Your suit's been breached.

30:57.116 --> 30:58.334
<i>It's not gonna protect you
from the Kryptonite.</i>

31:11.739 --> 31:13.567
Kara! No!

31:15.395 --> 31:17.876
I'm not gonna be the reason
Kara's trapped in here.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.548
<i>Brainy,
where are you with the virus?</i>

31:38.592 --> 31:39.419
I'm working on it.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.381
<i>I think I got it.</i>

31:45.425 --> 31:47.644
Virus has been deployed.
The Coluan energy core
is shutting down in three...

31:48.558 --> 31:50.343
<i>two, one.</i>

31:50.386 --> 31:51.257
Everyone, take cover.

31:58.699 --> 32:01.789
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, we're all right.
Right, Supergirl?

32:14.149 --> 32:15.455
I got him.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.413
-You did it.
No, we did it.

32:17.457 --> 32:19.633
Brainy would never have
been able to make that virus
without your help.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.770
You didn't really
mean all those things
you said, did you?

32:26.814 --> 32:27.989
I meant every word.

32:28.685 --> 32:29.860
What a mess.

32:30.470 --> 32:31.297
I got this.

32:53.275 --> 32:55.974
I took Kelex
back to the Fortress.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.193
He'll be all right.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.239
We can go see him tomorrow,
if you want.

33:03.764 --> 33:04.808
No.

33:07.507 --> 33:12.947
I need to return to Argo City,
and finally face your mother.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.340
Face her?

33:14.383 --> 33:16.646
When I found out you
and your mother were alive...

33:18.039 --> 33:20.824
it was the happiest moment
of my life.

33:21.869 --> 33:24.002
And I miss her so much, Kara.

33:24.872 --> 33:26.743
In the Phantom Zone,

33:26.787 --> 33:29.746
the memory of her and you
were what kept me alive.

33:29.790 --> 33:34.012
But now seeing her again,
isn't just some far off dream.

33:36.362 --> 33:38.886
It's... an inevitability.

33:41.193 --> 33:42.846
And the thought
of looking her in the eye

33:42.890 --> 33:45.806
and seeing all of my mistakes
reflected back on me...

33:49.897 --> 33:52.030
I didn't think I could handle
the weight of that guilt.

33:53.901 --> 33:56.599
You did everything you could
to save Krypton.

33:57.644 --> 34:00.081
I did.

34:00.125 --> 34:03.519
And that made me
part of the problem.

34:03.563 --> 34:08.089
I made rash decisions
out of hubris
and made everything worse.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.613
Then when I saw your planet
heading in the same direction,

34:10.657 --> 34:14.313
I thought,
if I could just fix Earth,

34:14.356 --> 34:17.229
I could
earn my way back to her.

34:18.273 --> 34:20.058
I was so focused
on avoiding the past,

34:20.101 --> 34:22.756
I ran headfirst
into all my old mistakes.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.108
I definitely understand that.

34:28.762 --> 34:31.286
I may have made
a lot of mistakes in my life.

34:32.461 --> 34:36.422
But the one thing
that went right, was you.

34:36.465 --> 34:40.165
You are strong and caring
and have built
a beautiful life.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.342
But, Kara...

34:45.431 --> 34:47.737
you don't need to carry
the weight of this world

34:47.781 --> 34:51.001
or any world on your shoulders
every moment of every day.

34:55.702 --> 34:58.966
Sometimes, even though
you're Kryptonian...

35:01.229 --> 35:03.492
it's okay to be human.

35:07.670 --> 35:12.371
Zor-El, Brainy's set
to take you back to Argo City
whenever you're ready.

35:18.507 --> 35:20.553
Almost 40 years
in the Phantom Zone

35:20.596 --> 35:23.469
was worth it
just to see you again.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.863
I'm gonna miss you
so much, Father.

35:39.876 --> 35:42.401
Andrea, you published
my article.

35:43.793 --> 35:47.232
I thought you wouldn't do it
unless I trashed Lex.

35:47.275 --> 35:50.452
Your article was good, William.
It didn't need
the Luthor Corp angle.

35:50.496 --> 35:53.629
Not to mention
the photo you got
of this giant trash robot.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.805
-It's a real attention-grabber.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.807
-It is?
-Yes.

35:57.851 --> 35:59.461
But I also realized something.

35:59.505 --> 36:04.162
These attacks on National City,
we've been killing ourselves

36:04.205 --> 36:07.252
trying to cover them
like every other news outlet.

36:07.295 --> 36:11.517
But the real story...
is who's stopping them.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.478
Supergirl and her friends?

36:16.522 --> 36:19.960
"Super Friends?" Huh.

36:20.003 --> 36:22.528
That's good. I like that.
Let's run with that.

36:23.529 --> 36:24.965
Run with what, exactly?

36:25.008 --> 36:26.184
Our future.

36:27.315 --> 36:30.144
CatCo made Supergirl.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.843
And they have enjoyed
a mutually beneficial
relationship ever since.

36:33.887 --> 36:37.238
But like Supergirl,
we need to think bigger.

36:37.282 --> 36:41.199
It's not just
how these heroes save the day.

36:41.242 --> 36:45.203
It's why. What drives them
to do what they do.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.031
I want a full profile
on these heroes,

36:48.075 --> 36:50.512
and I want a lasting
relationship with all of them.

36:50.556 --> 36:53.254
Track their every move,
until we're the ones they call

36:53.298 --> 36:56.649
before they go fight
a giant robot or a Phantom.

36:56.692 --> 37:00.522
Okay. But they're superheroes,
and we're only human.

37:00.566 --> 37:03.395
How do we
cover their every move?

37:03.438 --> 37:06.833
Well, you're
the investigative journalist.
You'll figure it out.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.418
Hey, Lena, is everything okay?

37:26.461 --> 37:28.811
<i>Yeah, everything's
actually good.</i>

37:28.855 --> 37:32.946
<i>I just got off the phone
with Kara,
but I wanted to call you.</i>

37:32.989 --> 37:35.165
I finally understand
what the Kelpie means.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.907
Y-You did? What's it mean?

37:37.951 --> 37:39.953
<i>That I don't have to
feel guilty anymore.</i>

37:39.996 --> 37:42.172
I've spent my entire life
feeling responsible

37:42.216 --> 37:47.090
for my mother's death,
even though I know
it's not true, but...

37:47.134 --> 37:50.746
every time I thought about her,
I would just
be drowning in guilt.

37:52.574 --> 37:56.230
Facing that Phantom
allowed me to break through
and finally let go.

37:57.492 --> 37:59.712
-That's great. <i>
-It also made me realize</i>

37:59.755 --> 38:03.237
that all of that guilt was
keeping me from knowing
who my mother really was.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.719
So... I've decided
to change that.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.288
I'm gonna go home.

38:11.985 --> 38:13.987
-Uh, to Luthor Mansion? <i>
-No.</i>

38:14.814 --> 38:15.989
To where I was born.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.385
Thank you, Nia.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.169
Sure.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.448
Okay. I'm not going to
let the chopsticks
defeat me tonight.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.755
But you, you're gonna
have to open the wine.

38:44.191 --> 38:47.194
I, I tried. There we go.

38:48.108 --> 38:49.979
Okay.

38:53.113 --> 38:56.856
It was so cold in there.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.858
-When?
-In the...

39:00.076 --> 39:02.035
Phantom Zone.

39:03.036 --> 39:05.691
-Oh, Kara--
-So empty.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.258
Every breath felt like...

39:10.086 --> 39:11.218
like ice.

39:14.526 --> 39:16.484
And I was so weak.

39:16.528 --> 39:19.182
It's okay. You don't have to
talk about this, okay?

39:19.226 --> 39:21.620
-Remember?
-No, no, no, I-I want to.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.319
I need to.

39:26.276 --> 39:27.452
Okay.

39:31.151 --> 39:34.197
I don't want
to be alone anymore.

39:34.241 --> 39:38.071
You are not alone.
You've got me.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.208
It's okay.

39:45.252 --> 39:48.864
I think I just, I just...

39:48.908 --> 39:52.128
so desperately wanted
to get away from
the Phantom Zone, that I...

39:53.434 --> 39:55.741
didn't let myself process...

39:57.612 --> 39:59.397
how much I went through...

40:00.963 --> 40:03.139
how afraid I was.

40:09.755 --> 40:12.584
What if that fear
never goes away?

40:14.673 --> 40:16.936
You know...

40:16.979 --> 40:21.984
when I, uh, when I thought
that we couldn't
get you back...

40:22.028 --> 40:25.901
I just wanted to give up.
I mean, like...

40:25.945 --> 40:27.816
Like I couldn't get out of bed.
I couldn't...

40:28.948 --> 40:31.646
You know? And now,
that we did get you back,

40:31.690 --> 40:36.477
I still feel like
you could slip away
at any moment.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.610
I felt that way today, too.

40:39.611 --> 40:42.309
And I'm so sorry.

40:42.352 --> 40:45.094
Because all I want to do
is just shield you
from any more pain,

40:45.138 --> 40:47.967
that I just
didn't even think...

40:49.316 --> 40:52.667
the only way out, is through.

40:54.626 --> 40:57.367
And we're going
to get through this together.

41:01.067 --> 41:02.372
Healing together.

41:03.983 --> 41:04.897
Yeah.

41:08.509 --> 41:11.338
Iris West-Allen wrote a piece
for the <i>Central City Citizen</i>

41:11.381 --> 41:14.341
about how the city
came together after an attack.

41:16.169 --> 41:17.997
That's what I need
to write my piece on.

41:20.565 --> 41:24.133
That is a very noble
and a very courageous
thing to do.

41:26.005 --> 41:27.006
Thank you.

41:29.835 --> 41:32.054
And we need to get you a fork
because I am not gonna

41:32.098 --> 41:35.318
let you embarrass yourself
trying to use these chopsticks.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.451
I'll show you chopsticks.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.496
Oh, no.

41:50.246 --> 41:51.247
Nyxly.
