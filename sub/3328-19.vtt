WEBVTT

00:02.530 --> 00:04.395
BELL:
Holmes?

00:07.440 --> 00:09.499
Holmes.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.269
Thoughts?

00:11.310 --> 00:13.471
Well, your working theory
is obviously that

00:13.510 --> 00:15.102
this man was interrupted

00:15.140 --> 00:17.643
in the performance
of his duties by the thief,

00:17.680 --> 00:21.070
who then brained
the unfortunate mortician

00:21.120 --> 00:24.089
and made off with
all of his clients' jewelry.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.781
So how, then,
do we explain these

00:25.820 --> 00:27.754
bite marks?

00:27.790 --> 00:29.758
It's an oddly personal
means of attack,

00:29.790 --> 00:31.155
is it not?

00:31.190 --> 00:32.623
Especially for
a transaction conducted

00:32.660 --> 00:34.799
solely in the name of
the profit motive.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.695
Yeah, we thought it was weird.

00:36.730 --> 00:39.437
Maybe the robbery
was just a cover?

00:39.470 --> 00:41.131
You said the owner
found his body

00:41.170 --> 00:42.501
exactly like
this, right?
Mmm.

00:42.540 --> 00:43.700
(knocking)

00:43.740 --> 00:45.628
Excuse me,
Detective.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.377
Leslie Loughlin,
from the 5-3 squad.

00:48.410 --> 00:50.105
Oh, I'm Detective Bell.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.118
This is Holmes, Watson,
our consultants.

00:52.150 --> 00:53.640
What brings you down
from the Bronx?

00:53.680 --> 00:54.817
The MO.
you got here.

00:54.850 --> 00:56.386
In the last
couple of weeks,

00:56.420 --> 00:57.648
we've had two young
women turn up dead

00:57.690 --> 00:59.510
with bite marks
on their shoulders.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.187
Looks a lot like a pair of
killings we thought we closed

01:01.220 --> 01:02.721
back in '05, but...

01:02.760 --> 01:04.523
now I'm starting to think
we got the wrong guy.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.720
Excuse me, you said
young women with

01:05.760 --> 01:07.125
bite marks on
their shoulders?

01:07.160 --> 01:08.855
Was this in Pelham?
Yeah.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.527
Anyway, I figured
if my guy

01:10.570 --> 01:11.821
did this,
maybe the NYPD

01:11.870 --> 01:13.758
only needs one
vampire hunter.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.336
This is not a murder.

01:15.370 --> 01:17.304
It's an accidental death.

01:18.470 --> 01:20.506
Mr. Robertson was

01:20.540 --> 01:22.269
standing on the table,

01:22.310 --> 01:23.709
and he fell off

01:23.750 --> 01:25.172
and hit his head.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.713
The robber broke in
several hours later.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.786
(sniffing)
This... scent.

01:29.820 --> 01:31.310
Do you smell that?

01:31.350 --> 01:33.716
Honestly, I've been
trying not to breathe.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.113
Well, if you did,

01:35.160 --> 01:36.479
you might detect
the faintest trace of...

01:36.530 --> 01:37.679
(sniffing)

01:37.730 --> 01:40.426
...marijuana laced
with embalming fluid.

01:40.460 --> 01:41.654
When your toxicology report
comes back,

01:41.700 --> 01:43.167
I'm quite certain
it will confirm

01:43.200 --> 01:44.792
that our young mortician here

01:44.830 --> 01:46.798
was experimenting with "wet."

01:46.840 --> 01:48.489
The kick is something
like, uh, PCP.

01:48.540 --> 01:49.700
So I'm told.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.537
So he was high.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.834
How, uh, how do you
explain the biting?

01:53.880 --> 01:56.144
This young lady here.

01:56.180 --> 01:57.647
Our mortician

01:57.680 --> 01:59.409
has his shirt off as quite a...

01:59.450 --> 02:00.610
quite a sensible precaution

02:00.650 --> 02:01.844
against the stink.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.609
He fell against her open mouth,

02:03.650 --> 02:05.845
the weight caused
her mandible to clamp...

02:05.890 --> 02:07.710
Oh.

02:11.660 --> 02:13.196
Is the pin important?

02:13.230 --> 02:14.891
Oh, crucially so.

02:14.930 --> 02:16.466
We know that

02:16.500 --> 02:17.626
our robber gained access

02:17.670 --> 02:18.864
via bathroom window,

02:18.900 --> 02:20.492
but there's no evidence
whatsoever

02:20.540 --> 02:23.338
that he gained egress
from the building.

02:25.340 --> 02:26.705
I think
he stumbled

02:26.740 --> 02:29.504
upon this scene
just moments before the owner.

02:29.550 --> 02:34.169
Not wishing to have
to explain his role in this...

02:34.220 --> 02:36.518
the burglar sought
a place to hide.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.854
Aahl
Sorry.

02:39.890 --> 02:41.255
I mistook you
for a corpse.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.754
The good news is,
you won't be charged

02:43.790 --> 02:45.326
with the murder
of the mortician.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.191
But I'm guessing that
the jewels in question

02:47.230 --> 02:48.492
are still in_
your possessron.

02:48.530 --> 02:49.895
Hmm?

02:52.270 --> 02:53.498
Wow.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.236
Guess I wasted
a trIp.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.365
Thank you
for your time.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.771
OFFICER:
This way. This way.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.386
Detective Loughlin.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.342
That case in 2005...

03:11.390 --> 03:12.948
did it involve someone
named Aaron Colvnlle?

03:12.990 --> 03:14.389
Actually...

03:14.420 --> 03:15.614
yeah, it did.
Do you remember it?

03:15.660 --> 03:17.525
Can I take a look
at your files?

03:18.590 --> 03:19.796
Colville
copped a plea

03:19.830 --> 03:21.252
to the two homicides
backin'05.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.790
He died later that year.

03:22.830 --> 03:25.492
Now, to me it looks like
the bite marks

03:25.530 --> 03:26.963
in these two most
recent cases

03:27.000 --> 03:28.536
match the marks from '05.

03:28.570 --> 03:29.969
Which, considering

03:30.010 --> 03:31.534
Colville's been dead
gomg on ten years,

03:31.570 --> 03:33.504
argues against him
being the doer.

03:34.980 --> 03:37.244
Can I make a copy
of these files?

03:37.280 --> 03:38.679
Sure.

03:38.710 --> 03:40.712
Uh, do you mind ifI
ask your interest here?

03:40.750 --> 03:44.641
Were you involved in
the original case?

03:44.690 --> 03:47.511
MAN:
So the world wants us
to be solemn.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.448
Right? We tackle big problems,

03:49.490 --> 03:51.788
we're surgeons,
and so people feel better

03:51.830 --> 03:53.491
if we have just
the right demeanor.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.748
And that's fine,
that's fine out there.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.290
But in here?

03:57.330 --> 03:59.332
This is where
the rubber meets the road.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.497
Now, the solemnity of
the surgeon's work

04:01.540 --> 04:03.360
follows us into this room
no matter what we do.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.299
And it'll eat you up
if you let it.

04:06.340 --> 04:09.275
So part of your job is...

04:09.310 --> 04:10.846
not to let it, okay?

04:10.880 --> 04:13.940
Dr. Karthik?

04:13.980 --> 04:15.538
*

04:40.380 --> 04:42.746
Dr. Watson.

04:42.780 --> 04:44.475
My gosh, it's
been years.

04:44.510 --> 04:45.807
Yes.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.818
So... it's nice to see you.

04:47.850 --> 04:49.613
Uh... how's your practice?

04:49.650 --> 04:53.484
Uh, actually, I haven't
practiced medicine since 2011.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.454
Oh, really?
Well, um...

04:55.490 --> 04:56.752
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.451
Thanks.

04:58.490 --> 05:00.924
Um, I'm here to talk
about Aaron Colville.

05:02.530 --> 05:05.363
Okay, I... I am...
not discussing Colville.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.038
What happened
that night?

05:07.070 --> 05:08.799
Nothing happened that night.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.034
I treated my patient.

05:10.070 --> 05:11.435
I was there.

05:13.010 --> 05:15.001
He might not have
killed those women.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.348
We may have let
an innocent man die.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.073
WOMAN:
Patient's coming out of Rikers
with four stab wounds,

05:56.120 --> 05:58.111
all punctures
to the thoracic region.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.458
WATSON:
Give me the stats.

05:59.490 --> 06:00.559
BP'S 65/45.

06:00.590 --> 06:02.080
We hung two units
on the way over,

06:02.120 --> 06:03.951
but he's losing
a lot of blood.
Can I see that?

06:03.990 --> 06:05.389
The doc at Rikers
gave me hIS chart.

06:05.430 --> 06:06.692
Guy's name's
Aaron Colville.

06:06.730 --> 06:08.049
From the news?

06:08.100 --> 06:09.965
Don't know if you saw
on there or not,

06:10.000 --> 06:11.592
but he's an
organ donor.

06:11.630 --> 06:12.790
Okay, on three.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.161
One, two, three.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.906
Good.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.059
Okay...

06:19.110 --> 06:20.475
Now, nurse,
I need him intubated.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.978
And let's get his chest open.

06:42.130 --> 06:43.620
What did he say?

06:43.670 --> 06:44.819
Uh, nothing.

06:44.870 --> 06:47.168
Come on, let's go.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.931
(monitor beeping steadily)

06:56.810 --> 06:58.038
(monitor flatlines)

06:58.080 --> 06:59.570
He's arresting.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.871
DOCTOR:
Yeah, I'm looking
right at it.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.013
Starting massage.
Lynn...

07:03.050 --> 07:04.984
go get Dr. Reed,
please.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.510
Really?
We might need her.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.879
If we can't bring
him back, we're

07:07.920 --> 07:09.456
definitely going to need
an extra set of hands.

07:09.490 --> 07:10.582
Lynn, please.

07:10.630 --> 07:11.779
Go get Dr. Reed.

07:17.030 --> 07:18.588
Dr. Fleming,
he needs the epi.

07:18.630 --> 07:19.892
Just hold on.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.067
Let me see if _I can't
get this gomg.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.831
He needs the epi.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.529
All right,
I'm calling it.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.720
It's 1:04.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.053
WATSON:
That epinephrine
could've saved his life.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.795
We let him die.

07:50.830 --> 07:52.092
We've been
over this.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.496
I gave that man
the same standard of care

07:54.540 --> 07:57.634
I provide anyone who comes
through the doors of my O.R.

07:57.670 --> 08:00.639
I didn't even know
who Aaron Colville was.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.205
A psychotic murderer,
bludgeoning and biting women

08:03.250 --> 08:05.673
ten blocks from the neighborhood
where you lived and worked.

08:05.710 --> 08:07.871
I... I didn't make
the connection

08:07.920 --> 08:09.217
till after he passed.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.081
Why are we talking
about this?

08:11.120 --> 08:12.985
If you had an issue
with my behavior,

08:13.020 --> 08:14.681
you should have
filed a complaint.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.779
We're talking about
a decade ago.
Listen,

08:16.830 --> 08:18.980
I am consulting
with the NYPD now.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.895
Police are investigating
two new murders,

08:20.930 --> 08:23.262
and everything about them
looks like the crimes

08:23.300 --> 08:24.699
that Colville
was charged with.

08:24.730 --> 08:26.163
Then it was a copycat.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.168
I mean, that's the term, right?
All the victims

08:28.200 --> 08:29.701
were bitten.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.105
We are waiting for
official confirmation,

08:31.140 --> 08:33.176
but it looks like
the same bite marks to me.

08:33.210 --> 08:34.700
Okay, well,

08:34.740 --> 08:36.139
if that's what you
came here to say,

08:36.180 --> 08:37.545
you know, consider
me informed.

08:37.580 --> 08:38.774
Listen.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.540
He said something
to you that night.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.810
If there was any clue
as to what he said,

08:43.850 --> 08:45.181
if he thought
he was being framed...

08:45.220 --> 08:46.915
Dr. Fleming,
please.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.814
There's nothing anyone
can do to you now.

08:49.990 --> 08:51.651
It wasn't anything like that.

08:51.690 --> 08:53.055
It was gibberish. Okay?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.250
He was coding, for God's sakes.

08:55.300 --> 08:58.269
What do you think, you're
gonna set things right here?

08:58.300 --> 09:00.234
Surgeons make
calls, Joan.

09:00.270 --> 09:01.737
It's part of the job.

09:01.770 --> 09:03.101
I-I do it all the time.

09:03.140 --> 09:04.300
I don't lose sleep over it.

09:06.910 --> 09:09.299
(phone chiming)

09:19.790 --> 09:21.815
You know, you could just
move the ladder, too, right?

09:21.860 --> 09:24.886
Here we are! Ha!

09:24.930 --> 09:28.024
You know, I've been cursing
Ms. Hudson for misplacing this.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.596
Turns out_ she's
recategorlzed It

09:29.630 --> 09:30.767
under historical meteorology.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.689
Clever.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.833
Tradewinds and Ocean Currents,
first published in 1914.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.360
Out of print,
if you can believe it.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.900
That's a travesty.

09:38.940 --> 09:40.305
You jest, but this atlas

09:40.340 --> 09:42.877
may soon come in very handy.

09:42.910 --> 09:44.969
I do wish you wouldn't leave
my texts unanswered.

09:45.010 --> 09:46.307
Well, I do wish that
you wouldn't keep writing

09:46.350 --> 09:47.749
when I don't respond.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.316
We have an offer to consider.

09:49.350 --> 09:50.988
Several of the trust fund brats

09:51.020 --> 09:52.988
that Mycroft aligned
himself with at university

09:53.020 --> 09:54.783
are underwriting
a treasure hunt of sorts.

09:54.820 --> 09:57.254
An expedition in search
of a sunken ship.

09:57.290 --> 09:58.757
And we've
been invited.

09:58.790 --> 09:59.996
Are you serious?

10:00.030 --> 10:02.055
Our quarry, the 5.5. Waratah,

10:02.100 --> 10:04.068
has been called
Australia's Titanic.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.397
It is, unquestionably,

10:05.430 --> 10:07.068
the_most famous
mIssmg shipwreck.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.658
It disappeared
in 1909

10:08.700 --> 10:10.008
carrying 211 souls

10:10.040 --> 10:12.008
and a safe stuffed full
of their valuables.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.803
Now, I'm not suggesting
we be motivated

10:13.840 --> 10:16.673
by anything as vulgar
as an enormous finder's fee,

10:16.710 --> 10:18.803
but I just thought
you might like to bid adieu

10:18.850 --> 10:20.169
to our 17th straight
month of winter

10:20.220 --> 10:22.074
and join me in sunnier climes
for a week.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.280
That sounds fun.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.686
You should go.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.859
It's only fun
in the right company.

10:31.990 --> 10:33.855
Where did you disappear to?

10:36.330 --> 10:39.766
So, Aaron Colville took
a plea bargain in 2005

10:39.800 --> 10:43.031
and was then stabbed
to death in prison.

10:43.070 --> 10:45.959
He we are nine years later.

10:46.010 --> 10:48.808
Two new murders appear
to have been committed.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.047
Hmm.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.844
Well, you know,
as I always say,

10:53.880 --> 10:55.677
bite-mark analysis
is only slightly more scientific

10:55.720 --> 10:57.847
than casting chicken bones about
to see the future.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.711
But I'm unaware of any case
where two suspects have

11:00.760 --> 11:03.320
identical teeth.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.884
I suppose we should proceed

11:04.930 --> 11:06.727
under the assumption
that the same party

11:06.760 --> 11:09.399
is responsible
for both sets of murders.

11:09.430 --> 11:11.864
So, Aaron Colville was innocent?

11:11.900 --> 11:13.891
Of these particular crimes,
probably.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.896
But there is a reason
he was a suspect.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.760
You seem distressed. Why?

11:17.810 --> 11:20.779
Well, I just stood there
and watched him die.

11:20.810 --> 11:24.405
You... Watson, you didn't
stab Aaron Colville

11:24.450 --> 11:26.771
on Rikers Island.
Nor did you fail to administer

11:26.820 --> 11:28.310
the epinephrine shot
in what you judged to be

11:28.350 --> 11:29.817
a timely fashion.

11:29.850 --> 11:32.341
That was your colleague,
your superior.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.278
Yes.
So what would've happened

11:34.320 --> 11:36.823
if you had filed a complaint
against your attending surgeon?

11:36.860 --> 11:38.020
Do you think
that would've been wise?

11:38.060 --> 11:39.027
"Wise"?

11:39.060 --> 11:41.051
Does that matter?

11:41.100 --> 11:42.761
Of course_it_ matters.
You're chastlsmg yourself

11:42.800 --> 11:46.429
for failing to make
a futile gesture a decade ago.

11:46.470 --> 11:48.097
Amway,

11:48.140 --> 11:49.437
your feelings are trivial

11:49.470 --> 11:52.030
'cause we have
a murderer to catch.

11:52.070 --> 11:54.334
The bite mark,
timeless expression

11:54.380 --> 11:56.029
of the frustration of impotence.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.446
And for us,
a stroke of luck.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.971
Our man did not leave
a suitable DNA sample,

12:01.020 --> 12:02.442
but he did sign his work.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.516
And as soon as we match these
to a person,

12:04.550 --> 12:06.108
we can put this behind us.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.378
Well, it's not that easy.

12:07.420 --> 12:08.910
There's no
law enforcement agency

12:08.960 --> 12:10.484
that keeps a database
of dental records.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.986
No, they're medical records,

12:12.030 --> 12:13.349
and that would be illegal.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.322
And that's
why they use consultants.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.328
We'll need someone
with state-of-the-art

12:17.370 --> 12:20.032
computing skills.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.059
What?

12:21.100 --> 12:22.499
My regular contact in London

12:22.540 --> 12:24.269
has forsworn the practice.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.528
Something about not wanting
to go to jail.

12:26.570 --> 12:28.174
So we'll have

12:28.210 --> 12:31.008
to contact them.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.075
I thought we left
on good terms with Everyone.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.247
Well, as far as you
can be on good terms

12:35.280 --> 12:37.316
with an anonymous collective
of immature hackers,

12:37.350 --> 12:39.318
we did.

12:39.350 --> 12:42.114
They are still an anonymous
collective of immature hackers.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.526
If we come to them, cap in hand,
asking for medical records,

12:44.560 --> 12:47.358
they're always
gonna have their price.

12:48.460 --> 12:49.427
I don't get it.

12:49.460 --> 12:50.791
You don't have to get it.

12:50.830 --> 12:52.525
(grunts)

12:55.900 --> 12:56.969
Do you need ice yet?

12:57.010 --> 12:58.864
No.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.309
They're already an hour late.

13:00.340 --> 13:02.535
I don't know how much more
of this you can take.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.309
(sighs)

13:11.150 --> 13:14.017
Sorry, sorry,
one go a day. Sorry.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.085
What about my boys?

13:16.120 --> 13:18.987
All right, come on.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.891
Happy hunting.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.007
These are transparencies taken
from the dental records

13:31.040 --> 13:33.235
provided by Everyone.
The photograph,

13:33.280 --> 13:34.577
of course, depicts bite marks

13:34.610 --> 13:37.249
left by our killer.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.114
This one's close, but
the lateral incisor is crooked.

13:41.150 --> 13:43.141
Just a few thousand more to go.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.249
(sighs)
27,000.

13:45.290 --> 13:47.019
An overwhelming
majority of killers

13:47.060 --> 13:49.051
strike wit_hin three_miles
of their primary re5idence.

13:49.090 --> 13:51.888
While it's true that we're
looking for a psychopath,

13:51.930 --> 13:54.524
it's unlikely that he commuted
to the next borough

13:54.560 --> 13:56.869
for his dental care.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.595
One of the hundreds
in the Bronx

13:58.630 --> 14:01.133
most likely flosses our madman.

14:01.170 --> 14:03.035
Why don't you rest?
I'll take the first shift.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.461
As you wish.

14:08.310 --> 14:09.948
(sighs)

14:18.990 --> 14:21.288
(birds chirping)

14:24.260 --> 14:26.581
Hey, wake up!

14:26.630 --> 14:29.019
Take a look
at this slide.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.391
We got him.

14:31.430 --> 14:33.159
It appears we do.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.566
His name is Alan Vikner, 52.
He is a patient

14:35.600 --> 14:37.329
at Olinville Dentistry,
which happens to be

14:37.370 --> 14:39.031
within a mile
of both recent murders.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.072
As is his mailing address.

14:41.110 --> 14:42.407
He's an ex-con,
served four years

14:42.440 --> 14:45.568
for aggravated assault.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.146
Must be a new patient.

14:47.180 --> 14:48.647
One visit, no X-rays.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.669
Someone should teach him
the importance

14:49.720 --> 14:51.312
of regular checkups.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.215
And not killing people.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.511
The officer
who brought me in said

14:54.560 --> 14:56.448
you found my prints
at the scene of a murder.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.082
That isn't possible.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.279
I'm living clean now.

14:59.330 --> 15:01.298
I'm a deacon at my church.

15:01.330 --> 15:04.026
Not your prints, Alan.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.437
Your bite marks.

15:07.470 --> 15:10.234
Oh, thank God.

15:10.270 --> 15:12.500
You relieved to see
these pictures?

15:12.540 --> 15:15.202
ALAN VIKNER: I told you,
you had the wrong guy.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.300
Lots of people make
these bite marks.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.944
I got my teeth knocked out

15:20.980 --> 15:23.483
in a fight in the yard
at Newgate Correctional.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.580
They gave me these.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.713
This doesn't make any sense.
Aaron Colville had

15:28.760 --> 15:30.489
all of his own teeth
when he died.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.952
You can put those
back in your mouth.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.628
Colville was
in Newgate from 2001

15:33.660 --> 15:35.355
to 2004-- that's one year

15:35.400 --> 15:37.664
before the first murders.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.396
And it also coincides
with Mr. Vikner's stay.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.499
GREGSON:
How did you wind up

15:42.540 --> 15:45.259
with a set of dentures
that match a killer's?

15:45.310 --> 15:49.076
I can't tell you that, but these
are standard issue up there.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.499
Colville was the model.

15:51.550 --> 15:54.212
The prison dentist
used his teeth

15:54.250 --> 15:56.548
to make a model
set of dentures.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.287
God only knows how many sets

15:59.320 --> 16:01.515
of Colville's teeth
are out there.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.098
MAN: _
I've only been the dentist here
for a few years.

16:09.130 --> 16:11.769
But the prison system doesn't
provide inmates with dentures.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.496
It just...
We don't have the funds.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.429
Official policy is
to pull problem teeth.

16:17.470 --> 16:18.698
We've just seen
a set of dentures

16:18.740 --> 16:20.628
which originated in this office.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.046
Uh, the guy who had
the job before me,

16:23.080 --> 16:24.502
his name was Conrad Nolan.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.041
And he was-- I don't...
I don't know-- a saint.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.570
He took it on himself

16:28.620 --> 16:30.508
to manufacture dentures
on his own.

16:30.550 --> 16:32.245
God love him, butI have kids

16:32.290 --> 16:33.712
to go home to
at the end of the day.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.580
Do you have Dr. Nolan's
contact information?

16:35.620 --> 16:37.053
Uh, he died
a few years ago.

16:37.090 --> 16:38.580
Pancreatic cancer.
Hold on a second.

16:38.630 --> 16:39.722
Stan?

16:39.760 --> 16:41.193
Yeah?
Come here a second.

16:41.230 --> 16:42.322
This is Stan Divac,

16:42.360 --> 16:44.191
and he's one of my assistants.

16:44.230 --> 16:45.367
He's been here a lot
longer than I have.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.469
Used to work for Dr. Nolan.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.592
Can you tell us

16:47.640 --> 16:49.198
about your denture program?

16:49.240 --> 16:51.663
Wouldn't really call it
a "program."

16:51.710 --> 16:54.474
Uh, Dr. Nolan
didn't like the idea

16:54.510 --> 16:55.738
of grown men gumming their food,

16:55.780 --> 16:57.338
and he figured out
a way to make them

16:57.380 --> 16:59.200
cheap enough so he could
foot the bill himself.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.218
And they modeled the dentures

17:01.250 --> 17:03.514
after an inmate named
Aaron Colwlle?

17:03.550 --> 17:06.212
Maybe.
Uh, Dr. Nolan picked someone

17:06.250 --> 17:07.751
with a good set of teeth.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.758
I don't think Doc Nolan
even told the guy he did it.

17:09.790 --> 17:12.657
He just made the dentures
based on an impression he took.

17:12.690 --> 17:13.827
How many sets of dentures

17:13.860 --> 17:15.748
did you distribute
based on the model?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.064
Maybe eight?

17:18.100 --> 17:21.069
Ten?

17:21.100 --> 17:22.738
GREGSON:
All these guys

17:22.770 --> 17:24.567
have Aaron Colville's teeth?

17:24.610 --> 17:26.566
The warden let us
sift through

17:26.610 --> 17:28.407
the inmate medical records.
We pulled every prisoner

17:28.440 --> 17:30.408
who had been fitted
for a full set of dentures.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.543
Eight suspects?

17:32.580 --> 17:33.672
Actually we are down to four.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.778
Alan Vikner has an alibi.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.310
Tash is dead.

17:36.350 --> 17:37.681
And Lalayanis and Parker

17:37.720 --> 17:39.085
have been locked up
the whole time.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.314
The remaining four settled

17:40.360 --> 17:41.588
near the city
after their release.

17:41.620 --> 17:44.327
Bring them in.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.624
I'll tell Detective Loughlin

17:46.660 --> 17:48.298
that she whiffed in '05

17:48.330 --> 17:50.423
and we've brought in
a set of fresh eyes.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.721
I'll also let
the commi55ioner know

17:51.770 --> 17:53.328
he'd better warm up to lawyers.

17:53.370 --> 17:54.337
Lawyers?

17:54.370 --> 17:55.667
We're about
to re-open

17:55.700 --> 17:58.567
a couple of homicide cases
from '05.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.339
Every plaintiff's
attorney in the city

18:00.380 --> 18:01.699
is gonna be lining up to sue

18:01.740 --> 18:03.401
on behalf
of Aaron Colville's family.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.319
This good?

18:12.350 --> 18:13.783
Yes, Mr. Pohlua.

18:13.820 --> 18:15.412
Those are the dentures
we're looking for.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.189
You can stop smiling now.

18:19.590 --> 18:21.126
Not bad, huh?

18:21.160 --> 18:23.299
Very nice.

18:23.330 --> 18:25.127
You can look
as long as you want.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.331
But I think the_ dentures
you're looking for

18:27.370 --> 18:29.588
are right here.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.562
You maintain more
than one set of dentures?

18:31.610 --> 18:34.135
The set I got in prison
never fit very well.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.671
I replaced them
as soon as I could.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.803
But I held on to them

18:38.850 --> 18:42.672
to remind myself how bad
it got when I was using.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.142
Can you tell us where you were

18:44.190 --> 18:45.817
on the 12th and the 16th
of last month?

18:45.850 --> 18:48.318
You said the 16th, right?

18:48.360 --> 18:50.385
Is it okay if I take
my shirt off?

18:52.190 --> 18:53.748
HOLMES: That's an inspiring
story, Mr. Deer.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.722
Unfortunately, it's
not a suitable alibi.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.489
You could've
switched dentures.

18:57.530 --> 18:58.861
Not really, though.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.289
When I bought the case,
I realized

19:01.340 --> 19:04.730
that the dentures
was too tall for it.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.635
See?

19:06.670 --> 19:07.830
I had to sand them down

19:07.880 --> 19:10.440
just to get them
to fit in there.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.313
I couldn't wear them
ifI wanted to.

19:14.950 --> 19:17.441
So...

19:17.490 --> 19:19.879
shingles was no fun.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.718
But if the hospital stay
takes me out of the running

19:22.760 --> 19:25.649
in your manhunt, uh,
it was worth it.

19:25.690 --> 19:28.193
You can go now, Mr. Pohlua.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.666
(door opens)

19:35.740 --> 19:37.901
Aside from the fact I find
your taste abhorrent,

19:37.940 --> 19:39.737
it does appears you are,
in fact, innocent.

19:39.770 --> 19:40.976
I know that.

19:41.010 --> 19:42.500
How do you know that?

19:42.540 --> 19:43.939
Your dentures are chipped.

19:43.980 --> 19:45.402
By the looks
of your left bicuspid,

19:45.450 --> 19:46.849
you broke it several years ago,

19:46.880 --> 19:48.518
and you haven't stopped
drinking coffee since.

19:48.550 --> 19:49.847
So?

19:49.880 --> 19:52.383
You can go.

19:56.660 --> 19:57.820
(door opens)

19:57.860 --> 19:59.725
(door closes)

19:59.760 --> 20:01.250
Three suspects interviewed,

20:01.300 --> 20:02.699
three suspects exonerated.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.425
So, who's the guy
we can't find?

20:04.470 --> 20:06.461
Daniel Escalante.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.661
Three arrests for
aggravated sexual assault.

20:08.700 --> 20:09.894
Apparently,
he's no longer

20:09.940 --> 20:11.567
at the address
parole has on file.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.599
Missed the last couple
of meetings

20:12.640 --> 20:13.777
with his PO, too.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.835
He's the only one left,

20:15.880 --> 20:18.940
so I guess he's
our new lead suspect.

20:18.980 --> 20:21.517
*

20:22.980 --> 20:25.585
(thud nearby)

20:25.620 --> 20:27.781
Your medical records
have arrived.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.959
Why are you looking

20:29.990 --> 20:32.550
into the recent case history
of Dr. Jonathan Fleming?

20:33.860 --> 20:35.953
Once again, opening my packages.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.592
We have enemies, Watson.
I needed to make sure

20:37.630 --> 20:38.961
_ there was _
nothing dangerous in here.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.695
Well, when I went to see
Dr. Fleming yesterday,

20:40.740 --> 20:42.696
he said me he "makes
calls all the time."

20:42.740 --> 20:45.538
There was just something
about the way he said it.

20:45.570 --> 20:48.403
So you think he routinely
denies adequate care

20:48.440 --> 20:50.579
to people he deems unworthy?

20:50.610 --> 20:53.044
I don't know.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.809
Something just wasn't right.

20:54.850 --> 20:57.546
I asked an old friend to
copy some records for me.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.809
So, unable to do anything
about the unprovable incident

21:00.860 --> 21:03.328
that you witnessed personally,
you thought you'd get

21:03.360 --> 21:05.385
to the bottom of some
that you weren't

21:05.430 --> 21:07.898
involved in at all.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.422
We're investigating
the so-called

21:11.470 --> 21:13.062
"Colville murders."

21:13.100 --> 21:15.330
Once the police track down
Daniel Escalante,

21:15.370 --> 21:17.429
we'll most likely have
the person responsible.

21:17.470 --> 21:19.665
Why is that not enough for you?

21:19.710 --> 21:21.974
What were you thinking

21:22.010 --> 21:23.341
when the paramedics
brought Aaron Colville

21:23.380 --> 21:24.972
into the operating room?

21:29.120 --> 21:32.886
(sighs)

21:32.920 --> 21:34.888
He was an organ donor.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.081
And yes, for a second,
I wondered

21:37.120 --> 21:40.897
if the world would be
better off if...

21:40.930 --> 21:42.818
if we just let him die.

21:42.860 --> 21:46.489
Hmm. So it's possible that your
colleague had exactly the same

21:46.530 --> 21:47.758
thought process that you did

21:47.800 --> 21:49.597
but decided
to go through with it.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.359
It's also possible
that he's saying

21:52.410 --> 21:55.379
the truth; that he had no idea
who Colville was,

21:55.410 --> 21:56.775
and that you're
just projecting

21:56.810 --> 21:59.370
your hesitation
onto Dr. Fleming.

21:59.410 --> 22:02.516
As it stands at the moment,
we'll never know, will we?

22:02.550 --> 22:04.040
Now, is it possible

22:04.090 --> 22:06.581
that you'll find a piece
of evidence in there

22:06.620 --> 22:08.383
which suggests
that he's a multiple offender?

22:08.420 --> 22:10.786
Well, yes,
I suppose it is.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.559
But I don't think
that catching Dr. Fleming

22:12.590 --> 22:14.797
is at the heart
of this particular matter.

22:14.830 --> 22:16.718
I think it's about you
forgiving yourself

22:16.760 --> 22:18.421
for a less than noble,

22:18.470 --> 22:20.461
if entirely understandable,
thought

22:20.500 --> 22:22.559
Which, I'll remind you,

22:22.600 --> 22:24.704
you didn't act on.

22:33.110 --> 22:34.839
Watson.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.417
Hmm?
Have you slept?

22:37.450 --> 22:39.941
Did you know the surviving
members of the Grateful Dead

22:39.990 --> 22:41.719
occasionally tour together
under the name Furthur?

22:41.760 --> 22:43.978
No.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.622
The name derives
from the placard

22:45.660 --> 22:47.127
atop Ken Kesey's infamous bus,
of course.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.991
Anyway, just got off the phone
with Detective Bell.

22:49.030 --> 22:52.090
Apparently, Daniel Escalante
is a major fan of the band

22:52.130 --> 22:54.098
and he's following them on tour
for the past several months.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.461
It's why he wasn't at the
address we have on file for him

22:56.500 --> 22:58.536
and why he hasn't checked in
with his parole officer.

22:58.570 --> 23:00.709
So, if Escalante
has been out of town...

23:00.740 --> 23:02.105
I personally have seen
an undoctored image

23:02.140 --> 23:03.471
of the man selling
grilled cheese sandwiches

23:03.510 --> 23:04.909
from a parking lot in Tennessee.

23:04.950 --> 23:05.974
He's not the man
we're looking for.

23:07.650 --> 23:09.572
we're looking for.
Not at the moment, no.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.485
So why do I have to get dressed?

23:11.520 --> 23:12.839
We're going back
to Newgate Correctional.

23:12.890 --> 23:14.187
The dentures which match
Aaron Colville

23:14.220 --> 23:16.085
were only made
and manufactured there.

23:16.120 --> 23:20.056
So we're going to spend some
quality time with their files.

23:26.770 --> 23:29.659
Uh, this is pretty much
everything we've got.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.531
If you could tell me

23:31.570 --> 23:33.504
what you're looking for,
maybe I could, uh,

23:33.540 --> 23:35.178
I don't know,
narrow it down for you.

23:35.210 --> 23:37.440
Would that we could, Stan.
Would that we could.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.471
Unfortunately, it's not
that kind of search.

23:39.510 --> 23:42.047
We won't know what we're
looking for until we find it.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.480
Okay. Well,
everything's alphabetical.
Mm-hmm.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.545
Pretty much.
Mm-hmm.

23:47.860 --> 23:51.648
Right. I suppose
I'll take, uh...

23:51.690 --> 23:53.419
this half.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.641
Watson.
(groans)

24:12.680 --> 24:14.614
I'm taking a break.

24:14.650 --> 24:16.515
Actually, we're finished here.
Have a look.

24:22.520 --> 24:26.923
It's the inmate file
of one Stanislav Divac.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.099
Stan was an inmate here?

24:29.130 --> 24:30.893
For a time.
He started working here

24:30.930 --> 24:32.192
while he was incarcerated.

24:32.230 --> 24:34.198
When he was freed,
he held onto his job.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.196
Who else was gonna hire
a convicted sex offender?

24:36.240 --> 24:37.764
There's
absolutely nothing

24:37.810 --> 24:39.061
in his dental records,

24:39.110 --> 24:41.101
but his file says he was treated
in the infirmary

24:41.140 --> 24:43.199
for a savage beating he received
in the yard in 2000.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.673
According to the report,

24:44.710 --> 24:46.541
he lost virtually all
of his teeth.

24:46.580 --> 24:50.038
So you think Dr. Nolan replaced
all of Stan's teeth for him.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.547
He did it with no
official record

24:51.590 --> 24:52.818
so that his valued assistant

24:52.850 --> 24:54.181
would not have
to wait for treatment.

24:54.220 --> 24:55.949
I'd do the same for you
if you lost

24:55.990 --> 24:57.218
all your teeth
in a prison fight.

25:06.730 --> 25:08.960
(knocking)

25:09.000 --> 25:10.831
I need to see
your a55istant.

25:10.870 --> 25:12.804
Oh, uh, Stan went home
a while ago...

25:12.840 --> 25:14.239
right when
you guys got here.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.975
He said it was
an emergency.

25:16.010 --> 25:17.238
Is everything all right?

25:17.280 --> 25:18.907
No, not really, no.

25:18.950 --> 25:20.872
I think you may have been
employing a murderer,

25:20.920 --> 25:23.912
and in all likelihood,
he just became a fugitive.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.823
That's interesting.

25:30.860 --> 25:33.795
Our Mr. Divac castrated himself.

25:33.830 --> 25:35.695
Have a look. It's right
here in the photographs

25:35.730 --> 25:36.799
the Rockland
County Police took

25:36.830 --> 25:38.969
when they raided
his home.

25:39.000 --> 25:39.762
How about I take
your word for it?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.131
No, no, no,
don't be squeamish.

25:41.170 --> 25:42.990
He did it chemically.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.201
The officers who invaded
Stan's place didn't take

25:45.240 --> 25:47.902
special notice, but if you
look at the medicine cabinet,

25:47.940 --> 25:49.976
he has a prescription
for MPA.

25:50.010 --> 25:50.977
That's medrowprogesterone
acetate.

25:51.010 --> 25:52.739
MPA...

25:52.780 --> 25:55.146
That's the drug they force
sex offenders to take.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.785
Could explain how he went
dormant for so long.

25:57.820 --> 26:00.243
He probably couldn't believe his
luck when Colville took the rap

26:00.290 --> 26:02.758
for the first
two murders in 2005.

26:02.790 --> 26:05.327
Decided to do everything
he could to suppress his urges.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.089
Mmm, ingesting
mass quantities

26:07.130 --> 26:08.927
of synthesized progesterone
will generally do the trick.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.928
Looks like it was
self-prescribed.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.961
The bottle has
a Medis RX label,

26:13.000 --> 26:14.763
which is a British
mail-order company.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.199
_ No doctor's
Signature reqUIred.

26:16.240 --> 26:18.959
Have a look at the date.
The bottle is half full.

26:19.010 --> 26:20.671
He should have run out
two months ago.

26:20.710 --> 26:22.701
Well, if he stopped
taking the drug 60 days ago,

26:22.740 --> 26:24.799
it'd take about that long
for his body to flush it.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.841
I just got off with
the Rockland County sheriff.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.347
Divac is in the wind.

26:28.380 --> 26:29.972
His social media accounts
have been deleted,

26:30.020 --> 26:32.238
and he hit up an ATM
near the prison.

26:32.290 --> 26:33.814
Sheriff says

26:33.860 --> 26:35.111
her roadblocks
are qUIet.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.650
I mean, maybe
we're lucky,

26:36.690 --> 26:38.954
and he's laying low
inside the radius,

26:38.990 --> 26:40.252
but chances are
he's long gone.

26:40.290 --> 26:41.951
We already put it out

26:42.000 --> 26:43.058
to the TSA.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.692
Spotlight on Croatia.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.721
Divac came over from there
when he was a kid.

26:46.770 --> 26:48.829
You emigrate from a
non-extradition country,

26:48.870 --> 26:50.861
probably where you head
when it hits the fan.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.730
WATSON:
Well, that wasn't
his first stop.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.203
He left the prison in a hurry,

26:54.240 --> 26:55.935
but his toiletries were missing
from his house,

26:55.980 --> 26:57.800
and_there was
no swtcase there.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.408
He obviously went back
to his home

26:59.450 --> 27:01.418
even though he knew
he was taking a risk.

27:01.450 --> 27:04.647
I think that he might have
gone back to pick up his dog.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.749
Did Rockland PD mention

27:06.790 --> 27:08.758
anything about animals
at the residence?

27:08.790 --> 27:10.678
Rings where the bowls
would have been.

27:12.390 --> 27:13.789
That's well-spotted,
Watson.

27:13.830 --> 27:15.149
GREGSON:
I'll revise the BOLO.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.758
Advise them the suspect

27:16.800 --> 27:20.167
may be traveling with his pet.

27:20.200 --> 27:23.294
No, I did not know they made
a model for dentures

27:23.340 --> 27:27.231
based on Aaron's mouth.
None of us did.

27:27.270 --> 27:30.899
This has all been
such a nightmare.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.838
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.041
Everybody's telling me to sue,

27:35.080 --> 27:37.913
but that's not going
to give me my son back.

27:37.950 --> 27:39.781
(footsteps approach)

27:39.820 --> 27:41.048
I'm sure time spent
with Aaron Colville's mother

27:41.090 --> 27:42.352
is just the thing
to cheer you up.

27:42.390 --> 27:44.187
Actually, if you are
going to be wallowing

27:44.230 --> 27:46.323
in your own guilty feelings
for the next 20 minutes or so,

27:46.360 --> 27:47.952
it's going to work out nicely
if you'd just

27:48.000 --> 27:49.695
stay out of the library
while you're doing it.

27:49.730 --> 27:51.994
I'm not wallowing.
I'm watching a news report

27:52.030 --> 27:53.930
on the case we're working.

27:53.970 --> 27:55.938
Is that a giant prom dress?

27:55.970 --> 27:57.961
It seems to me that
Stan Divac must have deleted

27:58.010 --> 27:59.261
his social media pages
for a reason

27:59.310 --> 28:00.709
before he went
on the run.

28:00.740 --> 28:02.105
There must be
something in there.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.949
So I reached out to
our friends at Everyone

28:03.980 --> 28:06.039
to see if they could
unearth some cached copies.

28:06.080 --> 28:07.399
And in return,
you're going to...?

28:07.450 --> 28:09.179
I meant to record myself
performing the songs

28:09.220 --> 28:10.369
from something called Frozen.

28:10.420 --> 28:12.183
Oh. Break a leg.

28:26.330 --> 28:29.493
Why did you dress Clyde up
like a shark?

28:29.540 --> 28:31.508
Ms. Hudson
is concerned the winter

28:31.540 --> 28:33.030
has been unduly harsh on him,

28:33.070 --> 28:34.731
so she knitted him
several turtle cozies.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.099
I find them amusing to look at.

28:36.140 --> 28:38.074
Thought it would be
a nice way to wake up.

28:38.110 --> 28:40.374
We need to get
to a veterinarian's office

28:40.410 --> 28:42.378
in Rockland County.
Excuse me?

28:42.420 --> 28:44.115
My performance
was extraordinary.

28:44.150 --> 28:46.015
Everyone concerned seemed
to agree that it rivaled,

28:46.050 --> 28:48.883
if not surpassed, the original.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.854
So everyone sent you copies
of Divac's stuff?

28:50.890 --> 28:52.983
Mmm. There will come_a
day when criminals realize

28:53.030 --> 28:54.395
that they shouldn't
use social media,

28:54.430 --> 28:57.297
but I just hope
I don't live to see it.

28:57.330 --> 29:00.766
Everyone was able to uncover
a rather large album

29:00.800 --> 29:02.529
of cached images
from Stan's page.

29:02.570 --> 29:05.539
Hundreds of photographs,
all perfectly innocuous,

29:05.570 --> 29:07.231
most of them featuring

29:09.580 --> 29:11.445
Mmm. He's cute.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.145
Is he sick?

29:14.180 --> 29:16.011
The captions tell

29:16.050 --> 29:17.847
the rather harrowing tale

29:17.890 --> 29:20.381
of Max's brave battle with
canine prostate cancer.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.388
He's been undergoing
chemotherapy.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.854
Now, the good news is
he's responded rather well

29:24.890 --> 29:26.426
to the first two treatments.

29:26.460 --> 29:29.429
The even better news is his
third treatment is scheduled

29:29.460 --> 29:31.166
for this morning.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.568
BELL:_
My guys are getting antsy.

29:39.610 --> 29:41.305
How much longer
you want to stay here?

29:41.340 --> 29:43.171
As long as it takes.

29:43.210 --> 29:45.440
His Web page didn't specify
the time of the appointment.

29:47.580 --> 29:50.447
Good morning. My friend here
has an appointment at 10:30.

29:52.990 --> 29:54.582
The dog looks familiar,

29:54.620 --> 29:56.918
but I don't
recognize the guy.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.587
I've seen him before.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.929
There were a bunch of pictures
of him on Divac's profile.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.928
They're friends
from the dog park.

30:03.970 --> 30:08.066
Okay, so Divac gave his dog
away and then skipped town?

30:08.100 --> 30:09.931
Let's find out.

30:11.610 --> 30:15.330
Excuse me. _
Are you housmg one Stan Divac?

30:15.380 --> 30:17.200
Uh, who?

30:17.240 --> 30:19.299
That was terrible.
Do you want another go?

30:19.350 --> 30:20.578
Your friend Stan

30:20.610 --> 30:22.168
may have told you
he's in trouble.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.518
Did he also tell you
it has to do with murder

30:24.550 --> 30:25.983
and that you're exposing
yourself

30:26.020 --> 30:27.510
to felony charges
by helping him?

30:29.390 --> 30:31.620
(groans)
Please, can you take these off?

30:31.660 --> 30:33.127
My hand really hurts.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.856
Sure... if you can give us
an alibi

30:35.900 --> 30:38.095
for the 12th and the 16th
of last month.

30:38.130 --> 30:39.529
I told you. I was home.

30:39.570 --> 30:41.037
I'm home most nights.

30:45.540 --> 30:47.132
alone?

30:47.170 --> 30:50.503
Yes. I live alone.
I forgot it was a crime.

30:50.540 --> 30:53.600
I'm sorry.
My hand really hurts.

30:53.650 --> 30:55.208
Is there something
you can give me for...?

30:55.250 --> 30:56.478
Stan, we know
about the MPA.

30:56.520 --> 31:00.115
We know you
stopped taking it.

31:04.260 --> 31:07.024
I made some mistakes
when I was young,

31:07.060 --> 31:08.948
but I did my time.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.298
When I got out,
I didn't want to slip.

31:11.330 --> 31:14.595
The medicine helped,
but it is terrible stuff.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.359
I've had kidney problems.
I gained some weight.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.209
I thought, you know,

31:19.240 --> 31:23.006
if the old...

31:23.040 --> 31:25.645
spark came back,

31:25.680 --> 31:28.012
I'm smarter now.

31:28.050 --> 31:30.314
I could control it.

31:30.350 --> 31:34.013
But then I quit the stuff...

31:34.060 --> 31:36.187
and there was nothing.

31:36.220 --> 31:40.554
I don't know if being on it
all those years changed me

31:40.590 --> 31:42.649
or if I just got old.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.225
But I don't want
to hurt anybody anymore.

31:47.570 --> 31:49.561
I just want to play
with my dog, you know?

31:49.600 --> 31:50.931
GREGSON:
Stan.

31:50.970 --> 31:52.938
You ran from the police.

31:52.970 --> 31:54.301
I know how it looks.

31:54.340 --> 31:55.705
I should have just told them

31:55.740 --> 31:57.605
when they asked about
the dentures, but I...

31:57.640 --> 31:59.369
I thought,
"How's it gonna look?" You know?

31:59.410 --> 32:00.570
I'm registered.

32:00.610 --> 32:03.044
I've got the same
teeth as this guy.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.719
I thought,
"Nobody's gonna believe me."

32:05.750 --> 32:07.980
Now nobody does.
I didn't do...

32:08.020 --> 32:10.113
Oh, God!
God, my hand...

32:10.160 --> 32:11.718
Something's
really wrong.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.159
GREGSON:
Just hold on.

32:13.190 --> 32:14.350
(moans)

32:18.470 --> 32:20.461
(Stan moaning)

32:23.770 --> 32:25.328
She was a
doctor, Stan.

32:25.370 --> 32:26.564
Let her
look at it.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.073
Be careful.

32:35.050 --> 32:36.074
Ow!

32:36.120 --> 32:37.747
Yeah, uh,
uh... okay.

32:37.780 --> 32:39.486
Looks like he might
have fractured

32:39.520 --> 32:41.317
his second metacarpal.
When did this happen?

32:41.360 --> 32:43.749
Uh, it hurt when they
put me in the car.

32:43.790 --> 32:45.758
Got worse as we drove over.

32:45.790 --> 32:47.758
I mean, you kind of have
to sit on your hands, you know?

32:47.790 --> 32:50.156
All right, all right.
Let's get him to the hospital.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.498
It's hardly a mortal wound.

32:52.530 --> 32:54.361
We have rules.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.231
And our lavwers
are already busy this week.

32:56.270 --> 32:58.238
(Stan signs in relief)

32:58.270 --> 32:59.567
Thanks.

32:59.610 --> 33:02.033
You're still under
arrest for murder.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.105
This way. Come on.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.401
(Stan moans)

33:08.350 --> 33:09.510
Come on,
turn here.

33:09.550 --> 33:11.643
He was gonna crack.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.043
Actually, I don't think he was.

33:14.290 --> 33:15.655
I don't think he did it.

33:15.690 --> 33:18.079
I don't think he killed
any of those women.

33:22.660 --> 33:25.595
WATSON:
The most recent victim's
name was Alexandra Stine.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.325
When her body
was found,

33:27.370 --> 33:28.689
her torso wasn't
scratched or bruised.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.129
It wasn't her body that
shattered this glass.

33:31.170 --> 33:32.535
She fought back
against her killer

33:32.570 --> 33:34.208
and slammed him
into that mirror.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.605
If that was Stan Divac,

33:35.640 --> 33:37.528
he would still be in
a full body cast.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.740
I don't follow.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.304
He has osteoporosis.

33:40.350 --> 33:42.272
The MPA.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.446
Stan's system was ravaged

33:43.480 --> 33:44.742
by the chemical
castration drugs.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.678
Bone loss is
a common Side effect.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.085
(phone chiming)

33:48.120 --> 33:49.280
When his left leg

33:49.320 --> 33:50.582
was in a cast last year,

33:50.620 --> 33:52.485
he told his 13 followers

33:52.530 --> 33:54.293
that he'd "stepped awkwardly
on the curb."

33:54.330 --> 33:55.695
He's a brittle man.

33:55.730 --> 33:57.288
WATSON:
Dr. Murray said

33:57.330 --> 33:58.592
he hasn't missed one day
of work this year.

33:58.630 --> 34:00.291
So there is no way

34:00.330 --> 34:02.093
that he was rammed
into this wall last month.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.165
GREGSON:
Let's just review.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.337
The guy's teeth
match all four murders.

34:06.370 --> 34:08.634
He's got no alibi,

34:08.680 --> 34:11.205
he's got a history
of violent sexual assault,

34:11.250 --> 34:12.706
he's off his meds,

34:12.750 --> 34:14.172
he lied to you,

34:14.220 --> 34:15.744
and he went on the run.

34:15.780 --> 34:17.668
You two find someone else
that checks all those boxes,

34:17.720 --> 34:19.085
come find me.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.384
(phone chiming)

34:21.420 --> 34:22.648
Who keeps texting you?

34:22.690 --> 34:24.783
The captain can
be brought round.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.183
We'll regroup at home.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.551
Actually, I have to go.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.669
FLEMING:
Did you have Carol Patton

34:35.700 --> 34:37.463
send copies of
my records to you?

34:37.500 --> 34:38.728
It wasn't her fault.

34:38.770 --> 34:40.761
No. She thought
she was complying

34:40.810 --> 34:43.404
with an official
investigation.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.544
That's illegal
in so many different ways.

34:45.580 --> 34:46.672
Why would you do that?

34:46.710 --> 34:47.699
You said that you...

34:47.750 --> 34:49.377
you "make calls" all the time.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.615
So you thought I was
admitting to killing people?

34:51.650 --> 34:54.778
Given what you said to me
a few days ago,

34:54.820 --> 34:58.221
I-I thought it was reasonable
to review your history.

34:58.260 --> 35:00.319
I don't know
that a court will agree.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.259
So let me _
ask you something:

35:03.300 --> 35:06.497
Do you think
that I'm a serial killer?

35:08.670 --> 35:10.888
So I'm going to tell you
something, Joan,

35:10.940 --> 35:13.602
because I hold
all the cards here.

35:13.640 --> 35:16.768
But maybe if you hear
what really happened that night,

35:16.810 --> 35:18.641
it'll give you some peace

35:18.680 --> 35:20.773
and, uh, I don't know,
let you end this.

35:20.810 --> 35:23.540
I will not ever admit
to saying this.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.608
I knew who Colville was.

35:27.650 --> 35:31.484
And he did say something to me.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.282
It was his last words.

35:33.330 --> 35:34.922
I mean,
he was doped up.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.621
I don't know if
he thought I was a priest,

35:36.660 --> 35:39.823
but he said
that he wanted to confess.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.290
He'd murdered two women.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.278
So...

35:48.310 --> 35:49.800
did I withhold treatment?

35:52.950 --> 35:55.168
I honestly don't know.

35:57.420 --> 35:59.547
So Aaron Colville
confessed to the murders

35:59.590 --> 36:00.784
with his dying words?

36:00.820 --> 36:02.458
Dr. Fleming said he confessed.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.378
I would take that
with a heaping pile of salt.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.751
Why? Does he have a particular
reason to lie to you?

36:06.790 --> 36:08.428
There's no need

36:08.460 --> 36:10.451
for him to change his story now.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.661
As he said,
he holds all the cards.

36:12.700 --> 36:14.258
He'd be best served

36:14.300 --> 36:15.597
by hewing to what
he's said all along.

36:15.640 --> 36:16.834
So you think
Dr. Fleming

36:16.870 --> 36:18.508
really wanted to tell me
what happened?

36:18.540 --> 36:19.734
I think_it's worth
con5idering.

36:19.770 --> 36:21.306
May I remind you
we're looking for

36:21.340 --> 36:22.637
fresh perspective on this case?

36:22.680 --> 36:24.443
I had been considering
burning the files,

36:24.480 --> 36:26.209
but this is less melodramatic.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.309
Aaron Colville
has been dead for years,

36:28.350 --> 36:30.238
but someone with his teeth
killed two women a month ago.

36:30.280 --> 36:35.559
Yes, but if Colville
killed those woman in 2005,

36:35.590 --> 36:37.717
this may
suggest motive.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.489
Whoever's committing
the murders in the present day

36:39.530 --> 36:41.555
wants us to know
about the dentures.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.999
They want to cast doubt

36:43.030 --> 36:44.588
on who killed those women
all those years ago.

36:44.630 --> 36:46.621
Why would anybody do that?

36:46.670 --> 36:47.819
I don't know.

36:47.870 --> 36:49.497
Not yet.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.861
The question becomes:
Who stands to benefit most

36:51.910 --> 36:54.435
from Aaron Colville's
exoneration?

36:55.910 --> 36:58.299
(birds twittering)

37:08.790 --> 37:10.519
(sighs)

37:12.060 --> 37:13.459
WOMAN:
...based on Aaron's mouth.

37:13.490 --> 37:15.629
None of us did.
This has all been

37:15.660 --> 37:17.628
such a nightmare.

37:17.660 --> 37:20.493
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.328
Everybody's telling me to sue,

37:23.370 --> 37:25.736
but that's not going
to give me my son back.

37:25.770 --> 37:27.738
Colville's mother.

37:27.770 --> 37:31.979
She's just filed a nine-figure
lawsuit against the city.

37:32.010 --> 37:35.468
And she bludgeoned
two women half her age?

37:35.520 --> 37:37.715
Ruth Colville raised
a psychopathic killer.

37:37.750 --> 37:40.310
Do you think Aaron's
childhood home was a happy one?

37:40.350 --> 37:42.454
I'm sure she's more
than capable.

37:42.490 --> 37:44.981
You have questions.
So do I.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.986
I'm sure a thorough search
of her residence

37:47.030 --> 37:48.895
will clear them up.

37:48.930 --> 37:50.921
No judge is gonna issue a
warrant based on a lawsuit

37:50.960 --> 37:52.518
she has every
right to file.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.538
We don't need a warrant.

37:54.570 --> 37:56.993
She's going to invite us
in quite graciously.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.008
That's all it was.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.907
The detectives.
I blame the detectives.

38:01.940 --> 38:04.500
(shudders)

38:04.550 --> 38:06.871
Thank you for speaking
to us, Mrs. Colville.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.616
I didn't say
I'd talk to you.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.743
I just didn't leave you
standing at the door.

38:10.780 --> 38:12.611
(chuckles)
Well, I think
it's a conversation

38:12.650 --> 38:13.947
that you'll
want to have.

38:13.990 --> 38:15.958
It's about
your son.

38:15.990 --> 38:19.687
I should have my lavwer here.
WATSON:
Yes,

38:19.730 --> 38:21.789
you should call your lawyer.
We have an offer for you.

38:23.130 --> 38:25.098
I guess you can wait
in the living room.

38:25.130 --> 38:27.098
Would it _be a terrible
inconvenience for me

38:27.130 --> 38:29.098
to use your facilities?

38:29.140 --> 38:30.960
Not a well man.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.865
It's just
down the hall.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.901
Right.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.019
My lawyer said this is unusual.

38:43.050 --> 38:44.779
An offer so early.

38:44.820 --> 38:47.516
It's a... unusual case.

38:47.550 --> 38:52.123
But it's obvious that there
was a... wrong committed here.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.128
Well, she'll be here
in a couple of minutes.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.128
I'm not supposed
to talk until then.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.752
Where's the other one?

38:57.800 --> 38:59.995
I'm here. Not a moment too soon.

39:00.030 --> 39:01.998
This grotesquerie's
gone on long enough,

39:02.040 --> 39:03.359
don't you think?

39:03.400 --> 39:05.504
What is this?

39:05.540 --> 39:07.030
It's your undoing.

39:07.070 --> 39:09.038
These are the snap-on dentures
she used

39:09.080 --> 39:11.605
to bite Alexandra Stine
and Veronica Sutter.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.744
I've never
seen those before.

39:14.780 --> 39:16.418
A DNA test will contradict you,
but I don't think

39:16.450 --> 39:17.712
that's going to be necessary.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.388
They're form-fitted
to your mouth.

39:19.420 --> 39:22.082
Your upper right bicuspid
is quite distinctive.

39:22.120 --> 39:24.156
Oh, look. A perfect match.

39:24.190 --> 39:27.455
You have no right. Those were
in a locked box under my bed.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.026
I thought you never
saw them before.

39:30.700 --> 39:33.589
I found these resting
on your bathroom sink.

39:33.630 --> 39:36.428
And as an invited guest,
I'm perfectly entitled

39:36.470 --> 39:38.097
to inspect any items
in plain view.

39:38.140 --> 39:40.404
(doorbell rings)
Oh, that must
be your attorney.

39:40.440 --> 39:43.079
You might want to find someone
with experience in criminal law.

39:43.110 --> 39:44.509
Tell me,

39:44.550 --> 39:46.177
how did you learn
of the existence

39:46.210 --> 39:48.440
of dentures
that match your son's teeth?

39:48.480 --> 39:50.914
It's the only thing
I can't piece together.

39:52.950 --> 39:55.589
That's fine.

39:55.620 --> 39:58.088
You can tell us about it
at the station.

40:11.470 --> 40:13.836
Ruth Colville
took a plea deal.

40:13.870 --> 40:16.805
Captain Gregson said
the transcript

40:16.840 --> 40:19.445
of her confession came in
at 24 pages.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.539
Hmm.
Apparently,
Dr. Nolan,

40:21.580 --> 40:24.071
the dentist at Newgate
who fashioned the dentures

40:24.120 --> 40:25.940
based on Aaron Colville's teeth,

40:25.990 --> 40:28.208
only found out
about the bite-mark murders

40:28.250 --> 40:30.013
in his dying days.

40:30.060 --> 40:32.881
He wrote to Ruth
and he told her to take heart--

40:32.930 --> 40:35.091
her son may not be a monster
after all.

40:35.130 --> 40:39.669
She made these snap-on dentures
using her son's dental records.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.668
Apparently, she approached
the young women

40:41.700 --> 40:43.190
by asking for help
with her groceries.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.698
Once they took her bags,
she pulled a hammer out.

40:46.740 --> 40:49.868
Oh. The Colvilles,
such a lovely family.

40:49.910 --> 40:52.504
Those are your files
on Fleming.

40:52.550 --> 40:53.869
Yep.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.969
I know as much
as I ever Will.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.908
And your role
in the matter?

40:57.950 --> 41:00.111
Aaron Colville was guilty.

41:00.150 --> 41:02.209
Does that change things?
I don't know.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.909
I do know

41:03.960 --> 41:05.825
that I was standing
over a dying patient

41:05.860 --> 41:07.725
and I was thinking
about justice.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.250
A doctor's not supposed
to do that.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.895
_ That sounds more _
like a consulting detective.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.598
Yeah.
