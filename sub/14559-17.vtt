00:08.609 --> 00:11.112
* Call me the juice
when I'm at a strip club *

00:11.145 --> 00:13.414
* I put down a hundred
or a dub *

00:13.447 --> 00:15.483
* I'm a mac to a playa,
I'm a stud *

00:15.516 --> 00:17.585
* Cuz when I leave the club,
I'ma ... *

00:17.618 --> 00:19.453
* Ride with the man
and be giving up the ... *

00:19.487 --> 00:21.522
* Little skinny, ride with ya,
I don't even know your name *

00:21.555 --> 00:23.624
* There's a whole lotta room
in the front of the Range *

00:23.657 --> 00:25.659
* Like Barack Obama said,
it's time for a change *

00:25.693 --> 00:28.496
* Pull over on the roll,
on the back seat *

00:28.529 --> 00:30.164
* Pop that body,
now ya got me *

00:30.198 --> 00:31.665
* You'll find a chick
kinda classy *

00:31.699 --> 00:33.634
* Said her name was ten,
now I'm grabbin' *

00:33.667 --> 00:35.569
* Now she got a grip
on the whip *

00:35.603 --> 00:36.737
* With her big round booty,
with the silicone ... *

00:36.770 --> 00:39.540
* She bouncin' on my lap
And she tryin'a own the six *

00:39.573 --> 00:41.809
* I whispered in her ear,
yo, it's hard for a pimp *

00:41.842 --> 00:43.611
Yeah, happy birthday.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.579
Come on, give
it up for "B"!

00:45.613 --> 00:46.814
Yeah.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.816
Happy birthday,
"B," give it up!

00:48.849 --> 00:49.650
Yeah!

00:49.683 --> 00:51.452
- Happy birthday, "B."
- All right.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.787
All right, all right,
listen up.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.856
I know tonight's about me,
but I got something to say

00:55.889 --> 00:57.725
to these two artists
on stage here.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.727
Okay, true and heartfelt.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.395
(laughing):
These two guys...

01:01.429 --> 01:03.464
Hunter
and 2BY4.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.566
Without ya'll,
we wouldn't be here.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.101
(cheering)

01:07.135 --> 01:09.870
They're the cornerstones
of Center Mass Records,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.805
brought us a whole lot
of business

01:11.839 --> 01:13.407
and attention, and, man...

01:13.441 --> 01:14.608
I just love ya'll.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.144
I love you.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.645
I love you.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.114
All right, give it up,
give it up

01:20.148 --> 01:21.649
for Hunter and 2...

01:21.682 --> 01:23.117
Yo, people, what ya'll
clapping for, huh?

01:23.151 --> 01:24.818
This mediocrity?
(crowd booing)

01:24.852 --> 01:26.220
You giving it up for a sellout
and a wannabe?

01:26.254 --> 01:27.388
Cut the mic!

01:27.421 --> 01:28.889
- You's a chump!
- I'm tired of this fool.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.724
Get this bitch
off the stage!

01:30.758 --> 01:32.493
All right, all right,
all right, all right, yo!

01:32.526 --> 01:35.129
(all clamoring)

01:35.163 --> 01:36.897
All right, hey,
it's enough, it's enough!

01:36.930 --> 01:38.332
It's not the place.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.801
It's not the place,
get him out-- back up!

01:40.834 --> 01:41.735
(grunting)

01:41.769 --> 01:43.904
Yo, that's 'cause
I'm real witty, yeah!

01:43.937 --> 01:46.207
I got skills!

01:46.240 --> 01:47.608
I ain't no wangster,
ain't no punk bitch, either!

01:47.641 --> 01:49.177
Get him out, get him out.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.678
We came to have
a good time, right?

01:50.711 --> 01:51.812
All right, it's
my damn birthday.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.647
Let's get this
thing started.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.850
Come on.
Hey, hit the music!

01:56.884 --> 01:57.885
(hip-hop music begins)
Yeah.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.224
* That lolli, lolli, lolli

02:03.257 --> 02:06.160
* Please, Lord,
have some mercy *

02:06.194 --> 02:08.429
* This girl is throwing Judy,
I think she... *

02:09.830 --> 02:11.699
Hey, so what do you think?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.867
I mean, I can probably just
take the 110 to the 105,

02:13.901 --> 02:15.603
and there shouldn't be
too much traffic, right?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.205
Yeah, yeah, the Dodgers
are in Houston.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.539
The rush hour will be long over.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.573
Okay.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.474
If you want,
we can run

02:20.508 --> 02:21.342
an aggregated speed
density function,

02:21.375 --> 02:22.810
do a mesoscopic
traffic simulation...

02:22.843 --> 02:23.911
Charlie, give
the abacus a rest.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.579
The 110 to the 105
will be

02:25.613 --> 02:26.580
just fine,
Amita.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.648
Do you want me to come with you?

02:27.681 --> 02:29.650
Uh, I mean, my parents
are going to be exhausted.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.219
They're getting off
such a long flight.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.720
I think we should just hold off
till tomorrow.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.188
You're worried they're
not gonna like me?

02:34.222 --> 02:35.723
No.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.758
I think we should
just wait till tomorrow night.

02:37.791 --> 02:38.859
Um, what are you
gonna wear tomorrow?

02:38.892 --> 02:40.794
She is worried they're
not gonna like me.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.962
Charlie, you're gonna
make her late.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.531
All right, I'll
wait up for you.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.233
Oh, um, no, no,
I don't know.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.634
I mean, I think
it's kind of weird

02:46.667 --> 02:47.901
me staying here
while my parents are here.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.903
Well, they'll be at a hotel.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.605
I mean, how would they
ever know?

02:51.639 --> 02:53.374
Yeah, I know, I didn't say
it was rational.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.708
You know, I just...
it feels weird.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.210
My dad knows
you spend the night.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.811
That's never
been weird.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.281
Well, it's weird now,
thank you very much.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.682
I'll call you later.

03:01.715 --> 03:02.916
Okay.

03:02.950 --> 03:03.917
- Bye.
- Drive safe.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.220
- Okay, thanks.
- Bye, Alan.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.522
Good-bye, Amita.
(door shuts)

03:08.556 --> 03:11.625
(hip-hop music playing)

03:11.659 --> 03:13.561
Hey, Hunter,
what about it, man?

03:13.594 --> 03:15.663
You coming up to B's house,
keep this thing going?

03:15.696 --> 03:16.964
No, man, I'm gonna
head on home, man.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.666
- Ya'll take it easy, man.
- Thank you, brother.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.301
Hey, man, everything cool,
you good?

03:20.334 --> 03:21.702
Yeah, I'm good-- what
ain't good, right?

03:21.735 --> 03:22.703
I guess, man.

03:22.736 --> 03:23.771
Ya'll take it easy, man.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.339
Yo, chill.

03:30.010 --> 03:30.911
(engine starts)

03:33.547 --> 03:36.284
(rapid gunshots, glass
shattering, people screaming)

03:39.287 --> 03:41.522
(sustained horn honking)

03:41.555 --> 03:44.358
(crowd exclaiming)

03:44.392 --> 03:45.793
(horn honking)

03:51.599 --> 03:54.001
Agent Warner,
what brings you out?

03:54.034 --> 03:55.803
Hey, I'm the one
who called you, Granger.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.037
What do you
say, Liz?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.273
Hey. So the victim's
a multiplatinum rap star

03:59.307 --> 04:00.741
on Center Mass Records.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.844
FBI drug squads have had an eye
on the label

04:03.877 --> 04:05.813
for about six months--
can't say it's related,

04:05.846 --> 04:06.947
but LAPD's agreed to let us

04:06.980 --> 04:08.382
roll on this one,
see where it goes.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.050
DON: Any idea if it was random,
targeted, what?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.485
LIZ: Well, one of the valets

04:11.519 --> 04:13.020
noticed the shooter's car idling
in the lot

04:13.053 --> 04:15.055
over there, so it sounds
like it was waiting for him.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.790
They didn't get
a plate number, though.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.591
No other witnesses?

04:17.625 --> 04:20.060
Probably, but none
talking to us.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.495
That's my husband in there!
That's my husband!

04:21.529 --> 04:24.332
Ma'am, you don't need
to see this.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.534
Easy, ma'am, just relax,
just step back, okay?

04:26.567 --> 04:29.303
LIZ: Mrs. Hunter, listen to me,
do you know

04:29.337 --> 04:31.372
who might have done this
to your husband?

04:31.405 --> 04:32.172
Rival crew, gang?

04:32.205 --> 04:34.375
My husband
wasn't like that, okay?

04:34.408 --> 04:35.876
He wasn't a gang member,
didn't pretend to be.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.578
DON: Okay, all right, what was
he? Wait, how about...?

04:37.611 --> 04:38.846
Why don't you help us out, then?

04:38.879 --> 04:40.013
What good is that gonna do me
helping you out?

04:40.047 --> 04:41.515
It's not gonna
bring Hunter back.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.351
Well, don't you want
to see his killer caught?

04:43.384 --> 04:44.718
That's your job.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.720
Mine is to make arrangements
to bury my husband.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.796
What have you
got there?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.030
This guy's a musician.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.732
Having two iPods,
is that weird?

05:01.435 --> 05:02.570
(beeps)

05:02.603 --> 05:06.340
(electronic whirring)

05:06.374 --> 05:08.676
I don't care what your taste is.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.678
That is not music.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.593
Yeah, this
encryption code

05:25.626 --> 05:27.728
is somewhat
elementary.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.898
Okay, there.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.634
Looks like some kind
of similarity

05:33.667 --> 05:35.536
or a string metric,
I'm pretty sure.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.737
Does that mean
like an algorithm?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.706
Yeah, uh, it looks
for commonalities

05:38.739 --> 05:39.707
in complex systems.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.008
It's used
in a lot of things.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.476
Plagiarism detection programs,

05:42.510 --> 05:43.644
for one.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.746
You know, a book
is a complex system.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.881
It's made up of individual
words and letters,

05:47.915 --> 05:49.750
but comparing those words
and letters

05:49.783 --> 05:51.151
would be meaningless.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.655
To detect plagiarism, you need
to look at the larger strings:

05:54.688 --> 05:56.990
sentences, paragraphs,
entire pages.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.528
A string metric allows us
to compare two systems

06:00.561 --> 06:02.563
and expose the plagiarist.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.432
Okay, so what would
a rap star be doing

06:04.465 --> 06:05.499
with one of
these equations?

06:05.533 --> 06:06.900
Well,
the narc guy said

06:06.934 --> 06:09.002
they had an eye
on Center Mass.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.170
So, what,
maybe drugs?

06:10.203 --> 06:12.139
Could be... I don't know yet.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.708
I did a full run on the
victim, Robert Hunter,

06:14.742 --> 06:16.444
and like his wife says,
um, he's clean.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.446
I mean, even his music,
it's no more violent

06:18.479 --> 06:20.481
or provocative than anything
else that's out there.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.550
Well, look, something
got him killed.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.754
(hip-hop music playing)

06:26.787 --> 06:28.856
LIZ: Here's my card-- if you
hear anything,

06:28.889 --> 06:31.759
I'd appreciate a call.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.927
All right,
how'd you do?

06:33.961 --> 06:36.497
I think if these
were Travis Tritt fans,

06:36.530 --> 06:37.631
I might
have better luck.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.132
Huh. Not your peeps, huh?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.668
Hey, for what
it's worth,

06:40.701 --> 06:42.002
by the way, I just wanted
to tell you,

06:42.035 --> 06:43.537
I'm glad you're working
this one.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.105
I mean, I get you
transferring out,

06:45.138 --> 06:46.807
the whole thing with Don
and all that,

06:46.840 --> 06:48.776
but I've always liked
working with you.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.644
Oh, thanks, Granger.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.046
Now, I wish I could say
the same thing about you.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.752
Who's this guy?

06:58.786 --> 06:59.953
Name's 2BY4.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.422
He's another artist
on Center Mass Records.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.858
Hunter, you were loved

07:04.892 --> 07:06.960
and will be missed, homie.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.797
And this won't go unanswered.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.934
Excuse me.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.102
Might as well

07:15.135 --> 07:16.804
pack that badge and go home.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.872
We handle our own
family business.

07:18.906 --> 07:19.907
Yeah, what business
is that?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.709
Cycle's in motion.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.211
Hunter got killed 'cause
of what went down at the party.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.780
Now there's gonna be
retaliation for that.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.716
That's the cycle, baby,

07:28.749 --> 07:31.485
Circle of Life,
know what I'm sayin'?

07:31.519 --> 07:32.920
What's up, baby?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.722
So what went down at the party?

07:34.755 --> 07:35.756
Guess it's just

07:35.789 --> 07:36.990
one of those things
where you had to be there.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.962
MAN: Mr. Blanchard, those Feds
are here.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.531
Over here.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.265
I have
a very busy schedule.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.768
Hope you don't mind if I
do this while we talk.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.537
For Hunter's funeral?

07:49.570 --> 07:51.672
Yeah, I gotta show
him all the respect.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.741
We'll be mourning his
loss for a long time.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.743
Financial loss,
too, I would imagine.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.811
He's one of your
top money makers, right?

07:57.845 --> 07:58.912
See, that's the
bitter irony.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.148
Hunter's new album pops
in three weeks.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.850
And when it does,

08:02.883 --> 08:04.217
it'll be
our biggest release ever

08:04.251 --> 08:05.853
because he got shot.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.154
And tell me how
I'm supposed

08:07.187 --> 08:08.789
to feel good about that.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.824
LIZ: Maybe you do something for
him in return.

08:10.858 --> 08:11.992
Help us catch his killer.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.027
I'm sorry, I wasn't out there

08:14.061 --> 08:15.696
- when he got shot.
- Come on.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.264
Someone of
your stature?

08:17.297 --> 08:20.534
I gotta figure nothing goes down
without you hearing about it.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.169
Oh, I might hear,
but I don't point fingers.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.004
Ah.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.173
Look, you already lost
one artist to the grave.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.307
2BY4 goes for revenge,

08:27.340 --> 08:30.778
you're gonna
lose another.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.547
Yo, Howe,
take a break.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.687
You might want to check
out a dude named Derek.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.555
All right, who's he?

08:41.589 --> 08:42.856
A hothead with limited talent.

08:42.890 --> 08:46.059
Always pestering me
to sign him to the label.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.195
He showed up that night.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.698
Look, I'm not saying
anything happened,

08:50.731 --> 08:52.833
but an event
like that,

08:52.866 --> 08:54.067
a lot of people
with cell phones.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.869
People shooting video.

08:55.903 --> 08:59.873
Maybe one of these videos
winds up on a Web site.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.077
BLANCHARD (on video):
2BY4! Whoo!

09:04.111 --> 09:06.780
All right,
so that's him right there.

09:06.814 --> 09:07.881
His full name's
Derek Raines.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.583
He's no Boy Scout,
but nothing big.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.984
Mainly juvie stuff.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.953
Vandalism, minor assault.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.287
DAVID: Anybody ever heard about
this guy?

09:14.321 --> 09:15.656
Apparently, he's
been rapping for years

09:15.689 --> 09:17.625
and puts his own stuff out
independently.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.027
But not even in the same
league as Hunter and 2BY4.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.796
Seems a little pissed about it,
don't you think?

09:22.830 --> 09:24.965
(shouting and fighting on video)

09:24.998 --> 09:26.333
Oh... you know, why don't you

09:26.366 --> 09:27.935
grab Liz
and go check him out, huh?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.637
Okay.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.973
Hey, Colb'.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.876
You, uh, talk to
Megan, by any chance?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.377
You know she asked ASAC
for a week off?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.912
No, she didn't say
anything to me.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.814
I can give her a call
if you want.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.182
Yeah, why don't
you do that?

09:42.215 --> 09:44.017
DEREK (on video): That's 'cause
I'm real witty!

09:44.051 --> 09:45.085
Yeah, I got skills!

09:45.118 --> 09:46.854
I ain't no wangster,
ain't no punk bitch, either!

09:52.325 --> 09:54.327
(knocking on door)

09:54.361 --> 09:55.128
Hey, Larry.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.864
How was the departmental
breakfast?

09:56.897 --> 09:57.898
It was less
than stellar.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.132
I was running late.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.369
And the only available seat
was next to Professor Hindslaus.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.904
The slurper.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.273
You know, all he had
was the fruit plate,

10:06.306 --> 10:07.741
and he was deafening.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.309
(chuckles)
Have you had time

10:09.342 --> 10:12.112
to distill any of my data
from the Hadron collider?

10:12.145 --> 10:13.280
Ooh, no, I haven't.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.281
Sorry, it's just that

10:14.314 --> 10:15.415
Don's got me doing this,

10:15.448 --> 10:17.050
and I've been so preoccupied

10:17.084 --> 10:18.185
over my dinner
with Amita's parents.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.887
- So...
- Oh, that's right.

10:19.920 --> 10:20.921
They're in town.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.055
I spent the whole night

10:22.089 --> 10:23.924
plotting a dinner strategy.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.893
A little game theory.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.060
A little Sun Tzu.

10:27.094 --> 10:27.961
The Art of War?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.062
What are you so

10:29.096 --> 10:30.230
worried about?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.331
I'm not Indian,

10:31.364 --> 10:32.800
for one.

10:32.833 --> 10:33.901
Listen,

10:33.934 --> 10:35.368
her parents were both
schooled here.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.070
They raised her here.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.939
I'm sure
they're very intelligent,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.240
cosmopolitan people.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.975
They tried to arrange
a marriage for her.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.010
Yeah,

10:43.043 --> 10:44.344
that had slipped my mind.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.879
What ever happened to him?

10:45.913 --> 10:46.914
He married some

10:46.947 --> 10:48.415
French chick he met in Belgium.

10:48.448 --> 10:51.251
It doesn't mean they don't
have someone else in mind.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.254
I'm sure all they want is
what is best for Amita.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.923
They will spend
some time with you,

10:55.956 --> 10:59.126
and they will soon be
singing your praises.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.997
That's why
he had the algorithm.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.266
So, this program

11:06.299 --> 11:07.935
is meant to analyze music.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.269
No kidding.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.938
And its mechanism
is inspired.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.072
It's brilliant, actually.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.240
It can process any song

11:13.273 --> 11:15.242
and predict its expected
level of success.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.944
You're saying
it can tell

11:16.977 --> 11:18.411
whether a song's going
to be a hit or not?

11:18.445 --> 11:19.947
- Yeah. Yeah.
- What?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.281
Within a certain,
uh, level

11:21.314 --> 11:22.883
of statistical
probability, yeah.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.017
No, no,
come on, look.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.052
Music is subjective.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.253
It's visceral.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.788
There's no way an
equation can tell you

11:27.821 --> 11:29.256
if a song's good or not.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.858
Well, we all like to think

11:30.891 --> 11:32.926
that we have our own unique
tastes, but we don't.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.061
There are certain

11:34.094 --> 11:35.896
rhythms, certain
key changes,

11:35.929 --> 11:39.199
chord patterns that we all,
as humans, respond to.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.368
Just like there are-are
smells that we all find

11:41.401 --> 11:42.602
pleasant or not.

11:42.635 --> 11:46.006
This program samples thousands
and thousands of hit songs,

11:46.039 --> 11:47.841
analyzes what they all have
in common,

11:47.875 --> 11:49.877
and then from there
creates a fairly accurate

11:49.910 --> 11:51.745
statistical guess
as to what will be a hit

11:51.779 --> 11:53.046
- and what won't.
- I agree

11:53.080 --> 11:54.181
with him; where's the art?

11:54.214 --> 11:55.515
It's not art.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.150
This is about business.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.986
Okay, so you're saying
that Hunter was carrying

11:59.019 --> 11:59.820
this thing around, trying

11:59.853 --> 12:01.321
to engineer his songs to be
hits?

12:01.354 --> 12:03.123
Maybe,
but from what I can tell,

12:03.156 --> 12:04.825
he hadn't analyzed
his own tracks yet.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.794
I mean, the data
folders were set up,

12:06.827 --> 12:08.962
for his album
and for 2BY4's as well.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.231
But, but the analysis
was never run.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.066
All right, so how
about you run it?

12:13.100 --> 12:14.401
Well, the albums haven't
been released yet.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.536
- So...
- Get a subpoena.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.271
Okay.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.506
(knocking on door)

12:19.539 --> 12:21.441
FBI, Mr. Raines.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.947
Mind stepping outside
so we can chat?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.081
I got a choice?

12:28.115 --> 12:29.316
You got a choice

12:29.349 --> 12:30.183
where we chat.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.156
Ah, you've done this before.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.859
You grow up around here,
cops just looking for a chance,

12:38.892 --> 12:39.960
know what I'm saying?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.796
What's this? You carrying?

12:44.231 --> 12:47.467
Right away you just
assume I got a gun.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.136
No, it's my recorder.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.070
I use it

12:50.103 --> 12:51.171
for my rhymes.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.106
Step inside.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.111
(hip-hop music playing)

13:00.147 --> 13:02.816
Gotta say, you're not someone
I expected

13:02.850 --> 13:04.985
to find here.

13:05.018 --> 13:05.986
Nina Hunter. The victim's wife.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.020
So what?

13:07.054 --> 13:08.956
Love triangle's the oldest
motive in the book.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.390
Hold on, man,
you got that all wrong.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.059
Mrs. Hunter, why
don't you and I

13:12.092 --> 13:14.928
go talk in the other
room here, okay?

13:14.962 --> 13:17.230
Come on.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.999
Figures the FBI
sent a brother

13:19.032 --> 13:20.133
to come talk to me.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.070
What, you, like,
the resident rap expert?

13:23.103 --> 13:24.537
I go the more Curtis Mayfield,

13:24.571 --> 13:26.206
James Brown,
early Stevie direction.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.208
You know, guys you're
always stealing from.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.543
All right, you said
you wanted to chat. Chat.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.579
I saw a video

13:32.612 --> 13:34.481
of what went down at
the party last night.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.916
You have an alibi

13:35.949 --> 13:38.251
for where you were after
you got tossed out?

13:38.285 --> 13:39.319
Derek and Hunter
were inseparable.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.254
All three of us were.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.090
I used to hang out
while they worked

13:43.123 --> 13:45.592
on rhymes together
and laid down tracks.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.628
But you were always
with Hunter.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.999
There's nothing going on
between Derek and me,

13:52.032 --> 13:53.166
if that's what you mean.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.501
Why are you so angry, Derek?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.436
Your magic career didn't
blow up like Hunter's?

13:56.469 --> 13:58.471
Nah, man,
that's not even my style.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.073
I taught Hunter
everything he knows.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.174
Yeah.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.977
Yeah, we used to be real tight
before he sold out.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.879
I'm here because I wanted
to be around somebody

14:05.913 --> 14:07.180
who knew Hunter
the way I did.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.515
Were Derek and Hunter
still in contact?

14:08.548 --> 14:09.950
No.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.252
Hunter tried reaching
out, but Derek

14:12.285 --> 14:13.253
wouldn't return
his calls.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.221
Too much pride.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.925
Why was Hunter reaching out?
I mean, why now?

14:17.958 --> 14:19.259
DAVID:
Let me ask you something.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.294
I mean, you got so much
spite for these guys.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.562
Right? Why'd you
crash their party?

14:22.595 --> 14:24.097
Yo, I ain't crash nothin'.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.198
I was invited.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.267
Yeah, Blanchard's
been sweatin' me

14:27.300 --> 14:29.269
for years, trying to get me
to sign to Center Mass Records.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.570
He knows
I'm the superior product.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.105
Is that so?

14:32.139 --> 14:34.174
So, but you chose all of this

14:34.207 --> 14:35.442
here instead.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.011
What do you know about a complex
math program he was carrying?

14:38.045 --> 14:39.679
An analytical program?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.481
Nothing at all.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.985
I chose to make my music
my way, so I control everything.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.054
(rapid gunfire)

14:47.087 --> 14:50.991
(glass shattering)

14:51.024 --> 14:51.558
(gunfire ceases)

14:51.591 --> 14:53.193
(car tires squealing)

14:53.226 --> 14:54.127
- You okay?
- Yeah!

14:57.497 --> 14:58.465
Damn it!

14:58.498 --> 14:59.499
You see the shooter?

14:59.532 --> 15:01.501
No, not enough.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.472
Derek!

15:05.505 --> 15:06.673
This is Agent David Sinclair.

15:06.706 --> 15:07.507
Yeah.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.676
I need an ambulance
to, uh, 632...

15:13.580 --> 15:17.650
DAVID: Get this. 2BY4's real
name is Theodore Durenberger.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.652
Bad-conduct discharge
from the army.

15:19.686 --> 15:20.988
Assault charge
from Vegas PD.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.355
He as good as promised

15:22.389 --> 15:23.490
he was going to go after Derek.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.058
Yeah, but you guys can't ID him.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.259
And Raines,
how's he?

15:26.293 --> 15:27.394
He's gonna
pull through.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.430
All right, so what, Derek pulls
a drive-by on Hunter,

15:30.463 --> 15:32.265
and-and 2BY4 returns the favor?

15:32.299 --> 15:33.666
DAVID: I don't know about that.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.735
Derek grows up in a really
rough neighborhood, right?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.604
He defies the odds
all these years,

15:37.637 --> 15:39.306
stays out of any real trouble.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.341
Then he pulls off
a drive-by execution

15:41.374 --> 15:43.676
in front
of a crowded club.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.178
I mean, that's a hell
of a first step.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.246
I'd still
like to know

15:46.279 --> 15:48.448
what Hunter was working on
before he was killed.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.582
We get anywhere
with that iPod yet?

15:49.616 --> 15:50.750
Speak of the devil.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.485
- What do you got?
- Got the subpoena.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.988
So, Charlie can run the
analysis on the music,

15:55.022 --> 15:59.459
but the catch is, the recordings
can't leave Center Mass Records.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.461
(hip-hop music playing)

16:01.494 --> 16:04.397
All right, guys,
I'll let them know you're here.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.601
So much for
popular culture.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.073
WOMAN:
Yo, yo, check this out.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.707
The comic book store's
down the street.

16:14.741 --> 16:18.011
(laughter)

16:18.045 --> 16:19.646
I haven't heard of
any of these artists.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.681
And it's not like I've
been living in a cave.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.084
No, just a space station
and a monastery.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.153
And, oh, yeah,
the steam tunnels.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.487
All right, point taken.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.322
This is Professor
Eppes and Fleinhardt.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.324
They're the ones who'll actually
be doing the analysis.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.125
- Hey.
- Pleasure.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.126
- Hey.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.761
Sorry you had to come
all the way down here.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.796
It's just, uh, I'm
kind of nervous.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.666
These albums are set to drop
in a couple weeks, and...

16:39.699 --> 16:41.401
I don't want to let
them out of my sight.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.535
It's no problem.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.770
- We totally understand.
- Good.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.173
Well, Kilo here should be able
to help you with everything

16:46.206 --> 16:47.507
you need. Thank you.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.244
All right,
see you later, guys.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.781
Follow me.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.119
(Charlie clears throat)

16:59.152 --> 17:00.487
So, I, uh... All right.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.721
Well, I guess
we'll just, uh...

17:01.754 --> 17:03.723
Is it okay if we
set up here?

17:03.756 --> 17:05.725
I know you, you know.

17:05.758 --> 17:06.693
You know me?

17:06.726 --> 17:07.794
No.

17:07.827 --> 17:08.628
You--

17:08.661 --> 17:09.529
Eppes.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.797
I bought your book.
The one on making

17:10.830 --> 17:12.799
- friends.
- Oh, my goodness.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.135
Uh, did it help you out
at all?

17:15.168 --> 17:16.803
I'm a fairly charismatic guy
to begin with,

17:16.836 --> 17:17.737
you know what I mean?

17:17.770 --> 17:19.272
Now, this here
is Reese.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.274
And that cat there,
that's Repete.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.610
They're gonna run
the joints for us.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.278
We're gonna start with one of
Hunter's cuts. Is that cool?

17:25.312 --> 17:26.479
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.

17:26.513 --> 17:27.714
let's, uh, kick it off

17:27.747 --> 17:29.349
with one of Hunter's joints.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.651
Man, first hibbie's
so tight,

17:31.684 --> 17:33.320
heads'll be losing they minds

17:33.353 --> 17:34.854
while we stack chips

17:34.887 --> 17:36.789
- like Lays, you heard?
- Yeah.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.291
(laughing)
Oh.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.460
My man. All right,
drop the joint.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.129
(hip-hop music blaring)

17:42.162 --> 17:44.331
* Let me see you pop that body

17:44.364 --> 17:47.434
* Lotsa lolli, jolly lolli...

17:47.467 --> 17:48.535
Feel the vibe?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.703
*

17:52.539 --> 17:54.807
(hip-hop playing)

18:00.580 --> 18:04.184
Sugar, you want to get with
the playa, just say so.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.518
You ain't gotta
be chasing me

18:05.552 --> 18:06.653
around like this.

18:06.686 --> 18:07.854
Thanks, yeah,

18:07.887 --> 18:09.122
I'll make a note of it.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.723
You go for a drive
earlier today?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.725
Maybe by Derek
Raines's house?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.495
Yeah, I heard someone 'bout
put his punk ass down.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.497
But you had nothing
to do with it, right?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.432
Nothing you could prove.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.833
Yeah, well, what if it hit Nina?

18:20.867 --> 18:22.335
You think
you'd be showing

18:22.369 --> 18:24.904
Hunter some great respect
by capping his wife?

18:24.937 --> 18:27.407
If Nina was at Derek's,
bitch gets what she deserves.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.441
Sleeping with
the enemy.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.277
Not with us, against us,

18:30.310 --> 18:31.911
- know what I'm saying?
- MAN: We're ready.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.348
Love to talk some mo,
but life is calling.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.417
I got to roll.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.785
MAN: All right,
let's go, let's go.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.488
I don't forget being
shot at, okay?

18:41.521 --> 18:44.791
Next time I come to see you,
you are done.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.426
MAN:
All right, quiet on the set.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.562
(hip-hop music playing)

18:54.401 --> 18:55.868
* You're a club girl, huh

18:55.902 --> 18:57.337
* Corruptin' the world, yeah

18:57.370 --> 18:59.239
* You're a club girl,
corruptin' the world *

18:59.272 --> 19:01.541
* You're a club girl,
I love you, girl *

19:01.574 --> 19:03.610
* You're a club girl,
corruptin' the world... *

19:03.643 --> 19:05.612
I'm sorry.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.647
Just for clarification
here, please.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.881
You know, earlier we said

19:08.915 --> 19:11.384
that being "corrupt"
was a good thing.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.753
But now here,
suddenly it carries this,

19:13.786 --> 19:15.588
uh, negative connotation.

19:15.622 --> 19:16.823
It's not about what

19:16.856 --> 19:19.326
you say, it's about how
you say it, right, Kilo?

19:19.359 --> 19:21.728
Look at the Professor
droppin' knowledge.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.796
Hey, maybe you ought
to come through

19:23.830 --> 19:25.332
the lab one day, lay down some

19:25.365 --> 19:26.833
friendship
math rhymes.

19:26.866 --> 19:27.867
- Oh.
- Trust me, I don't

19:27.900 --> 19:29.669
think either of us wants to hear

19:29.702 --> 19:30.870
that happen.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.872
(blipping)

19:32.905 --> 19:33.973
Hey, you what?
I think I have it.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.742
I-I think we got
what we need.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.710
Okay, well, thank you
for the education.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.579
- No doubt, my man.
- Okay.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.480
Uh...

19:40.513 --> 19:41.648
Word!

19:47.287 --> 19:50.457
The hit prediction algorithm
from Hunter's iPod correlates,

19:50.490 --> 19:52.525
within a fairly narrow range,

19:52.559 --> 19:55.362
with how commercially
successful a song will be

19:55.395 --> 19:56.429
over 80% of the time.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.897
The problem is,

19:57.930 --> 20:00.433
2BY4's songs invariably fall
into that other 20%, so...

20:00.467 --> 20:02.769
Yeah, you lost me,
Charlie.

20:02.802 --> 20:03.736
CHARLIE:
Okay.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.906
Uh... Candy bar, nice.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.641
And... What is that?

20:08.675 --> 20:10.843
Flavored tofu chips.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.413
This is perfect.
So I tested both rappers' music.

20:13.446 --> 20:16.015
Hunter's scored high marks.

20:16.048 --> 20:16.916
His raps are like candy bars.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.919
At least, according
to the algorithm,

20:19.952 --> 20:22.289
they're exactly what you'd
expect people to want.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.923
They're big sellers.

20:23.956 --> 20:27.394
However, 2BY4's songs
scored significantly lower.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.462
So, according to the algorithm,
2BY4's stuff

20:29.496 --> 20:30.863
is like musical tofu.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.365
Aah, you stole my punch line.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.767
Ho-Ho-Hold on.
So why do they sell?

20:34.801 --> 20:37.970
Well, maybe some
people like tofu.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.972
Not enough
to make him rich,

20:40.006 --> 20:41.608
not enough to make
him a star.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.775
(cell phone rings)

20:42.809 --> 20:46.479
Oh, no... Oh, my dinner.
Uh, bye.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.014
Dad... Yeah, no, I'm on my way.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.583
I know. I just
looked at my watch.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.985
Okay, so maybe 2BY4 found out,
right?

20:53.019 --> 20:54.621
And he was scared that
Hunter would out him.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.456
You know, tell the world
his music was crap?

20:56.489 --> 20:57.590
So you're thinking
you can make a case

20:57.624 --> 20:59.592
against him for doing Hunter?

20:59.626 --> 21:01.060
I don't know. I just was never
sold on Derek as the killer.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.629
And keeping Hunter quiet

21:02.662 --> 21:03.763
would definitely be a strong
motivator.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.031
Right.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.599
With Hunter gone, 2BY4 becomes
the number one act at the label,

21:06.633 --> 21:08.901
and tofu or not,
the son of a bitch was

21:08.935 --> 21:10.503
soaking up the spotlight today.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.838
Okay, run with it,
see what we get.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.809
Hey, Colb, so,
you talk to Megan?

21:16.843 --> 21:19.479
I left messages for her on
her home machine and her cell,

21:19.512 --> 21:21.414
but I haven't heard
anything back.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.085
There was a minimal probability
that we'd be late.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.020
I-I don't know
how I let this happen.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.822
Charlie, there's nothing
you can do about it right now,

21:29.856 --> 21:31.658
so just breathe and relax.

21:31.691 --> 21:35.528
Last thing you want to do
is show up late and sweaty.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.764
- Come on.
- Yeah.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.566
Hi. Good evening.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.435
Hey, listen. I'm, uh,
really very sorry.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.103
I started what I thought
was going to be

21:44.136 --> 21:46.038
a very simple, um,
plumbing repair.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.408
And before I knew it,
I was up to my knees.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.009
My sincere apologies.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.811
Oh, it's
quite all right.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.680
Our clocks are still
getting used

21:53.713 --> 21:55.948
to the time
change ourselves.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.016
Mom, this is Charlie's father,
Alan.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.486
And, uh, these are my parents,
Tapti and Sanjay.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.953
It's nice
to meet you both.

22:00.987 --> 22:01.788
Nice to meet you, too.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.755
And, uh,
this, obviously, is Charlie.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.992
Hi. It's a real pleasure
to meet both of you.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.027
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for quite some time.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.463
And us, you,
believe me.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.999
Okay, well,
why don't we all sit down.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.502
Charlie.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.604
All righty.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.981
I'm sorry... What?
(chuckles nervously)

22:29.015 --> 22:32.485
He's even cuter in person.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.822
(chuckles)

22:38.024 --> 22:39.726
We worry about Amita,

22:39.759 --> 22:40.993
especially now
that our work has us

22:41.027 --> 22:42.895
spending so much time
back in Delhi.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.764
It's a great comfort

22:44.797 --> 22:46.733
knowing there are people here
that really care about her.

22:46.766 --> 22:47.800
Very much.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.502
ALAN: Oh, yeah, we all do.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.471
Having raised two boys,
let me tell you,

22:51.504 --> 22:53.873
it's a real treat to
have Amita around.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.042
It's very impressive, Charlie,
all that you've accomplished.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.109
Oh, thank you, thank you.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.711
You know, Amita's been
a big part of a lot of it.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.146
Well, you're going to make

23:00.179 --> 23:02.148
some lucky girl
very happy someday.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.717
(chuckling)

23:05.585 --> 23:06.953
MAN:
Amita!

23:06.986 --> 23:08.921
Oh, my God, Kapil?!

23:08.955 --> 23:10.823
How are you?
(chuckling)

23:10.857 --> 23:11.891
(chuckles)

23:11.924 --> 23:13.993
- Hi!
- Oh, my God, look at you.

23:14.026 --> 23:14.994
AMITA:
What a surprise!

23:15.027 --> 23:16.128
It's so good to see you!

23:16.162 --> 23:17.697
KAPIL:
It's been a long time.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.499
Yes!
Charlie, Alan, this is Kapil.

23:19.532 --> 23:22.635
Um... we've known each other
pretty much forever.

23:22.669 --> 23:24.671
We grew up together.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.105
How you doing?
I'm Alan...

23:26.138 --> 23:28.174
TAPTI: I hope it's okay.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.176
We're going to be in town
such a short period of time,

23:30.209 --> 23:31.744
and when we found out

23:31.778 --> 23:32.311
Kapil was going to be here on
business, too,

23:32.344 --> 23:34.146
we couldn't not see him.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.682
We invited him

23:35.715 --> 23:38.485
to join us for dessert.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.653
Yeah, no, of course.
I'm gonna go grab a chair.

23:40.687 --> 23:43.690
It's so good to see you.
Do you live here?

23:43.723 --> 23:45.057
I'm thinking
about relocating.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.026
I got an offer from UCLA
Medical,

23:47.059 --> 23:48.227
and I think I'm going to take
it.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.197
I'm moving over here. I got to
get out to the West Coast.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.165
- Really?
- Yeah, I just love it out here.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.034
It's such a nice
surprise, you guys.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.136
I don't care
what the doctor said!

23:57.169 --> 23:59.171
And I don't care what orders
the FBI left!

23:59.205 --> 24:01.941
I want to see him!
Let me through!

24:01.974 --> 24:04.243
Mrs. Hunter... They won't let me
see Derek!

24:04.276 --> 24:05.912
Okay, talk to them.
Tell them who I am.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.614
Okay, first thing you need
to do is calm down.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.750
Thanks for the call.
I got it now.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.520
Why don't you tell me
what's going on? What happened?

24:13.553 --> 24:14.754
I didn't come here
to talk to you.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.123
I came here to talk to Derek.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.125
Come on.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.664
(heart monitor beeping
rhythmically)

24:27.233 --> 24:28.568
Understand now?

24:28.601 --> 24:31.604
He's in no shape
to talk to anyone.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.109
Mrs. Hunter,
what's going on?

24:37.143 --> 24:39.712
You found something out,
didn't you?

24:39.746 --> 24:41.514
I don't know.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.650
Is that your husband's computer?

24:43.683 --> 24:46.619
Is there something on there
I should know about?

24:46.653 --> 24:49.155
Mrs. Hunter, please.
You have to trust me.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.524
Why would I trust you?
I don't even know you.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.795
Look, if you know something
about Hunter's death,

24:55.828 --> 24:58.197
or you know
what he was working on,

24:58.230 --> 24:59.532
you have to tell me.

24:59.566 --> 25:00.967
I don't have to
tell you anything.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.201
You owe it to your husband.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.270
Don't you tell me
what I owe my husband.

25:04.303 --> 25:07.306
You don't know
anything about us.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.543
(keyless entry remote chirps)
(sighs)

25:18.618 --> 25:20.987
(car alarms blaring)

25:33.833 --> 25:35.668
Hey, how you doing?
You all right?

25:35.702 --> 25:37.336
I was thinking we should
duck you into the ER,

25:37.369 --> 25:38.871
have somebody
check you out.

25:38.905 --> 25:39.939
I'm fine... fine.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.307
(indistinct radio broadcast)

25:45.144 --> 25:47.013
I played it wrong, Colby.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.715
I said the wrong things.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.623
I talked to
the bomb squad.

25:56.656 --> 25:59.626
Um, it wasn't
a sophisticated device.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.927
It was tied
to the ignition.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.362
She turned the key,
and, uh, boom.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.797
COLBY: Still,
that's a little above

26:04.831 --> 26:06.799
2BY4's pay grade, no?

26:06.833 --> 26:07.800
He had some military training.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.902
I mean, it could have
included demolitions.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.872
MAN: Sir, we got
something here.

26:12.905 --> 26:13.706
You okay?

26:13.740 --> 26:14.741
Yeah.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.809
It's the laptop
Nina was carrying.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.945
I got the feeling
she knew something.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.914
She figured out
what Hunter was working on.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.249
This thing is pretty trashed.
(phone rings)

26:23.282 --> 26:26.919
We'll have to see what the lab
can salvage from it.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.020
Sinclair.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.889
I'll be right up.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.924
Be back.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.598
In there?

26:42.001 --> 26:43.369
What are you doing?

26:43.402 --> 26:45.071
What does it look like, man?
How far do you think

26:45.104 --> 26:47.106
you're gonna get before you're
right back in here?

26:47.139 --> 26:49.141
Far enough to do right
by Hunter and Nina.

26:49.175 --> 26:52.078
Don't... Don't do this.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.413
Okay, man, don't fall
into this now.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.749
Ain't no fall, man.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.317
I was pushed.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.122
It was a disaster.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.991
It was an unmitigated disaster.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.794
I mean,
no other way to explain it.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.796
Oh, come on.
It couldn't have been that bad.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.097
You should've seen this guy.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.765
I mean, he was handsome.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.200
He was, like, tall
with the perfect hair,

27:14.233 --> 27:15.434
the perfect teeth.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.037
Hmm... He was like
a Hindu Adonis.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.405
Really? Oh, dear.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.140
And did I mention
he's a doctor?

27:21.173 --> 27:22.909
Because Amita's mother
certainly did.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.410
Alan, you're just in time.

27:24.443 --> 27:25.678
Give us some objectivity.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.980
I think Charlie
may be overreacting.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.181
Did he mention
the word "disaster?"

27:29.215 --> 27:30.717
Numerous times.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.352
- It was a disaster.
- Thank you.

27:33.385 --> 27:36.355
Oh, hey. Excellent. Charlie...

27:36.388 --> 27:37.757
Can you do me a favor?
Take a look at this.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.860
We think it's a spreadsheet
for Center Mass.

27:43.395 --> 27:46.165
What are all those
holes in the data?

27:46.198 --> 27:47.266
It's from a messed-up
hard drive.

27:47.299 --> 27:48.200
It's the best
the lab could do.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.468
But I figure, maybe,
you can fill it in.

27:49.501 --> 27:53.105
We may not need to fill it in to
know what we're looking at here.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.141
You're thinking
of a Groebner basis?

27:55.174 --> 27:57.109
It's regularly used
used in long-distance

27:57.143 --> 28:00.012
astrophotography-- those amazing
images we get from the Hubble.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.313
Sure.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.015
It's a way to infer
the missing information

28:03.049 --> 28:05.017
without having
all the data.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.986
You know, like, uh,
remember when were kids,

28:07.019 --> 28:09.155
and we used to sit in the cheap
seats at Dodger Stadium,

28:09.188 --> 28:10.356
under the Jumbotron?

28:10.389 --> 28:12.124
It wasn't because
the seats were cheap.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.060
It was the best place
to catch a home run ball.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.261
Oh, yeah.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.063
- We had gloves on.
- Oh, yeah.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.831
The point is,
we couldn't see

28:18.865 --> 28:21.233
the screen because
we were sitting under it.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.301
We were too close. Right?

28:22.334 --> 28:24.103
So think of your
missing information

28:24.136 --> 28:27.106
as burned-out panels
on the Jumbotron.

28:27.139 --> 28:30.142
At that range, at a data level,
it's impossible to know

28:30.176 --> 28:31.443
what the panels should be.

28:31.477 --> 28:34.113
Using the Groebner basis
is like sitting way back,

28:34.146 --> 28:36.749
and seeing the screen
from the box seats.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.117
Despite the missing
information,

28:38.150 --> 28:39.185
we can see the overall picture.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.087
We can see what the system is,

28:41.120 --> 28:42.922
and once we understand
the system,

28:42.955 --> 28:45.324
we're far better equipped
to fill in the holes.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.759
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

28:46.793 --> 28:47.827
How about you take it with you?

28:47.860 --> 28:48.527
Yeah.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.163
Hey, what's going on with Megan?

28:51.197 --> 28:53.432
I assume she arranged
for time off.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.400
That's what I'm talking about.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.102
Is it something I need
to be worried about?

28:56.135 --> 28:59.505
No. She... She's fine.

28:59.538 --> 29:02.141
She's back in New York.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.076
Listen, more
I dare not say.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.178
Well, I will clear.

29:10.216 --> 29:13.185
* The boy got a lot of cheddar
and it only gets better *

29:13.219 --> 29:15.221
* Paid full grand
for the sweater *

29:15.254 --> 29:17.489
* Stacks in my hand,
gave money to my man... *

29:22.862 --> 29:25.932
* Little money in the stack,
market that, don't hurt... *

29:25.965 --> 29:28.167
Theodore Durenberger.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.236
This is the FBI!
We have a warrant!

29:30.269 --> 29:32.438
You have one minute
to show yourself

29:32.471 --> 29:34.941
before we enter by force.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.876
Liz, got anything around back?

29:36.909 --> 29:39.178
LIZ (over radio):
All clear.

29:39.211 --> 29:42.014
You think I'm scared of you?!
Like I'm some bitch?!

29:43.015 --> 29:44.183
You got a warrant?!

29:44.216 --> 29:46.518
Let me see your warrant!

29:50.957 --> 29:52.224
(quietly):
I want protection.

29:52.258 --> 29:53.459
You want what?

29:53.492 --> 29:56.162
I want help. Take me in.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.130
Derek's out, man.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.398
He's gunning for me.

29:59.431 --> 30:03.836
Please? You can't
let him get me.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.876
Yo, be cool!

30:09.909 --> 30:11.610
These jakes can't hold me.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.980
I'll be out in an hour!

30:14.013 --> 30:16.215
Word up!

30:19.185 --> 30:21.187
Hey, Charlie.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.588
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.857
I think that went really
well last night, don't you?

30:24.891 --> 30:25.691
Yeah.

30:25.724 --> 30:26.625
I think my parents really liked
you.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.327
Oh, they're sweet,
and the food was good.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.129
- Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

30:30.162 --> 30:33.199
Did you get to try
Kapil's pomegranate tart?

30:33.232 --> 30:35.868
Actually, I, uh...

30:35.902 --> 30:37.336
I couldn't get
a spoon in edgewise.

30:37.369 --> 30:38.570
Amita, I have to run.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.306
I have to go drop off
some results for Don...

30:40.339 --> 30:41.941
Charlie, is something wrong?

30:41.974 --> 30:43.876
Um, let's think.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.577
A guy shows up in the
middle of our dinner.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.214
Pretty much sweeps
you off your feet.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.917
Uh, wha-- You can't seriously
be jealous of Kapil.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.185
Of course not. He's only
handsome and successful,

30:53.219 --> 30:54.954
and he makes you... giddy.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.889
Charlie, he's gay.

30:56.923 --> 30:59.391
Oh.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.393
Well, how the hell
was I supposed to know that?

31:03.329 --> 31:04.630
You're right.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.265
I guess you couldn't.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.134
Which means
the whole thing

31:08.167 --> 31:10.536
must have seemed really bad.
I'm so sorry.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.041
So...

31:15.074 --> 31:17.376
do your parents know
that Kapil's gay?

31:17.409 --> 31:19.011
I don't know.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.079
Probably not.

31:21.513 --> 31:24.350
Oh, my God.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.585
They were trying
to set me up with him.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.691
2BY4:
This is whack.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.227
You don't need to treat me
like a criminal.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.662
I came in voluntarily, remember?

31:36.695 --> 31:38.230
Yeah, well, because
you're scared.

31:38.264 --> 31:39.031
The thing I don't

31:39.065 --> 31:40.399
understand is,
I thought you were

31:40.432 --> 31:42.201
supposed to be
this tough guy, right?

31:42.234 --> 31:43.502
- This hard-ass.
- Oh, man...

31:43.535 --> 31:46.038
Look, I was playing a part,
all right?

31:46.072 --> 31:47.039
Going through

31:47.073 --> 31:48.407
the motions to sell

31:48.440 --> 31:50.509
- some records.
- Two murders? An attempted

31:50.542 --> 31:52.478
third at Derek's house?
That's "going through

31:52.511 --> 31:53.412
the motions"?

31:53.445 --> 31:54.947
What murders?
All we did was spray down

31:54.981 --> 31:56.048
Derek's house a little.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.084
Had to meet
my fans' expectations.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.018
DON:
What about

31:59.051 --> 32:00.252
- Hunter and Nina?
- Everyone knows Derek

32:00.286 --> 32:01.553
did Hunter.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.323
Nina?

32:04.356 --> 32:06.325
- I got nothing there.
- All right, you know what?

32:06.358 --> 32:08.127
Cut him loose.
Derek can have him.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.429
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

32:10.462 --> 32:12.064
What about Blanchard?

32:13.432 --> 32:14.967
He and Hunter
were fighting over money.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.335
Hunter said
he was being ripped off.

32:16.368 --> 32:17.403
Blanchard has an alibi.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.504
Does Kilo?

32:18.537 --> 32:20.106
Blanchard's shadow,

32:20.139 --> 32:22.208
big, massive cat--
does whatever Blanchard says.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.409
Yeah, but you got
the bomb training.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.277
Kilo handles all

32:25.311 --> 32:26.645
the pyrotechnics
for the music videos.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.215
Dude loves to blow stuff up.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.220
Don't listen to me.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.254
Neither did Derek.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.457
Wait a minute.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.292
You told Derek
that Kilo killed Nina?

32:40.326 --> 32:42.194
Hell yeah, I did.
Dude called me,

32:42.228 --> 32:43.429
said he's coming
to kill me.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.097
You think I'm gonna
keep that a secret?

32:45.131 --> 32:47.033
Don't move.

32:47.066 --> 32:50.002
Looks like our boy 2BY4
handed Kilo over to Derek.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.437
So you coordinate
with LAPD.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.472
I got Kilo's and you guys
the record label, all right?

32:53.505 --> 32:56.275
All right.
Let's go.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.643
DAVID: Now, if Blanchard stole
Hunter's money,

32:57.676 --> 32:59.278
then he only has
two options, right?

32:59.311 --> 33:01.247
- Either he pays him back...
- Or he has him killed.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.414
- Yeah.
- Right.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.050
- Hey, I figured it out.
- Hey, come on.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.284
- Tell us in the elevator.
- Okay.

33:05.317 --> 33:09.388
Um, so remember how we were
stumped by 2BY4's record sales?

33:09.421 --> 33:10.456
That according
to the algorithm, his music

33:10.489 --> 33:12.624
- shouldn't be selling.
- Yeah, the musical tofu?

33:12.658 --> 33:15.227
Right, those spreadsheets you
gave me belonged to Center Mass,

33:15.261 --> 33:16.162
but they weren't meant

33:16.195 --> 33:17.496
- for anyone to see.
- What do you mean?

33:17.529 --> 33:18.664
It's an accounting log.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.432
It's a list of payola.

33:20.466 --> 33:21.467
Blanchard's been

33:21.500 --> 33:25.304
paying off radio stations
to play 2BY4's rap.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.440
You flood the airways enough,
people will buy anything.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.742
That explains why
2BY4's music's so popular.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.112
DON: Where did Blanchard get the
money he used?

33:33.145 --> 33:34.713
He skimmed it off
the artists' percentages.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.082
Right, so then he was

33:36.115 --> 33:37.283
stealing from
Hunter, right?

33:37.316 --> 33:39.051
Wait, wait, hold on--
where are you going?

33:39.085 --> 33:40.519
- Well, I have more to tell you.
- That's all right.

33:40.552 --> 33:41.387
You can just call me, okay?

33:41.420 --> 33:43.555
Hey, man, I took
the FBI training course.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.124
All right,
I'm more than

33:45.157 --> 33:46.225
qualified to ride with you.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.361
- You got to put this on.
- Awesome.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.731
(hip-hop music playing)

33:52.764 --> 33:54.433
* Let's roll, let's roll

33:54.466 --> 33:55.501
* Let's rock, let's rock

33:55.534 --> 33:56.468
* Keep the move...

33:56.502 --> 33:58.337
(groaning)

33:58.370 --> 33:59.771
Don't, Kilo. You're done.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.376
Oh, man, he took--
he took Blanchard.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.078
- Derek?
- Ooh, I got him.

34:06.112 --> 34:08.180
- I got him good.
- Yeah, just like

34:08.214 --> 34:09.181
you got Hunter and Nina?

34:17.723 --> 34:19.325
(cell phone ringing)

34:19.358 --> 34:19.758
(phone beeps on)

34:19.791 --> 34:21.127
DON:
Eppes.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.129
Don, Derek hit the record label.

34:23.162 --> 34:24.096
He's got Blanchard.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.197
Looks like they took off
in Blanchard's car.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.398
And Kilo?

34:26.432 --> 34:28.134
We got him and the gun
that I'm guessing

34:28.167 --> 34:29.501
is going to tie him
to Hunter's murder.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.270
Wait, what?!
Kilo killed Hunter?

34:31.303 --> 34:32.638
- Why?
- I just

34:32.671 --> 34:35.207
can't believe that
Kilo would do that.

34:35.241 --> 34:36.708
What about Derek?
Any idea where he's headed?

34:36.742 --> 34:38.144
- No, not a clue.
- Well, listen.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.010
If we can get him on his

34:39.044 --> 34:39.911
cell phone and keep him
on long enough,

34:39.945 --> 34:42.181
- we can track him, right?
- All right.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.816
It's just a suggestion.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.220
Okay, we're all set up.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.755
I've got Derek's
cell number.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.457
DON: All right, dial it up,
patch us through.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.159
David, you've got the most
juice with the guy,

34:53.192 --> 34:54.760
so try keeping him
on the line, all right?

34:54.793 --> 34:56.662
All right, I'll do what I can.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.366
(speed dialing)
We're dialing.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.134
All right,
I'm going on mute.

35:02.168 --> 35:04.203
(line ringing)

35:10.242 --> 35:12.244
(phone ringing)

35:13.612 --> 35:15.647
- Who's this?
- Derek, it's Agent Sinclair.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.283
I don't want to talk to you,
Sinclair.

35:17.316 --> 35:18.917
All right, then how about
you just listen, okay?

35:18.950 --> 35:20.686
It's not too late
to turn this thing around.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.188
Kilo's going
to be fine.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.555
You haven't killed anybody yet.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.424
That's about to change.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.893
Blanchard, he had Hunter
and Nina killed.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.198
This has got to be.

35:33.865 --> 35:34.866
LIZ:
All right, guys, we got him.

35:34.900 --> 35:38.237
They're headed east
on Washington near LaBrea.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.775
All these years, you've
kept it about the music.

35:43.809 --> 35:44.843
You stayed clean.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.212
And for what, huh?

35:46.245 --> 35:47.413
What was the payoff?

35:47.446 --> 35:48.847
I got to stop kidding myself.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.350
DAVID: No, no-- don't throw it
away like this.

35:51.383 --> 35:52.484
Derek, don't do it.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.220
You should listen
to him, Derek.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.387
Shut your mouth!

35:55.421 --> 35:57.389
LIZ:
They're turning onto Crenshaw.

35:57.423 --> 35:58.490
Going south.

35:58.524 --> 35:59.658
- All right, got it.
- DAVID: Don't throw it away.

35:59.691 --> 36:02.428
DEREK: I'm done hearing you,
Sinclair. I'm hanging up.

36:02.461 --> 36:03.295
Wait!
(beeps)

36:03.329 --> 36:04.896
Hey, Derek, don't
hang up. Not yet.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.198
Who's this?

36:06.232 --> 36:07.499
CHARLIE:
You don't know me, but I have

36:07.533 --> 36:08.900
information for you, all right?

36:08.934 --> 36:10.669
I know why your music isn't
selling like it should.

36:10.702 --> 36:11.970
What you talking about, man?

36:12.003 --> 36:13.605
It's Blanchard.
Just like he's been paying

36:13.639 --> 36:16.308
radio stations
to play 2BY4's music,

36:16.342 --> 36:18.277
he's been paying them
not to play yours.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.279
You been suppressing me, man?

36:20.312 --> 36:22.314
That's what I was going
to tell you. Hunter found

36:22.348 --> 36:23.982
the proof and now I have it.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.651
You've been holding me back?!

36:25.684 --> 36:28.454
Why? 'Cause I wouldn't sign
to your little corny-ass label?

36:28.487 --> 36:31.357
Yo, Derek, we can make
this all good. All right?

36:31.390 --> 36:33.325
I can fix this thing.

36:33.359 --> 36:34.393
LIZ:
Don, they're now east

36:34.426 --> 36:35.461
on Adams.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.896
(tires screeching)

36:39.331 --> 36:40.799
Look, I'm done talking to y'all.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.368
- I'm tired.
- Derek.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.236
- I'm hanging up.
- Derek!

36:48.407 --> 36:49.375
LIZ:
Don, signal's gone. We lost him.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.477
Last we had,

36:51.510 --> 36:52.478
they were east on Adams.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.212
Sorry, man, I tried to
keep him on long enough.

36:57.283 --> 36:59.251
I think I know
where they're headed.

37:00.486 --> 37:02.554
Yo, Derek,

37:02.588 --> 37:04.022
you look real bad, man.
Let me get you to the hospital.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.657
Shut your mouth.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.326
Go where I told you.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.863
Yo, D, man, just imagine.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.266
All right? We join forces...

37:14.300 --> 37:15.934
Man...

37:15.967 --> 37:17.369
you can have it all, D.

37:17.403 --> 37:18.770
It's too late.

37:18.804 --> 37:21.307
Nah, it's too late
for all of that.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.642
It's over for Hunter and Nina.

37:25.744 --> 37:26.845
Now, it's over for you.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.682
Stop the car.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.021
(brakes screeching)

37:36.054 --> 37:38.424
Just stay in the car!
Just stay in the car!

37:38.457 --> 37:39.825
Okay.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.393
Derek! Do you
hear me?!

37:41.427 --> 37:42.994
Derek!

37:46.398 --> 37:47.799
You think you can
jump out of this car

37:47.833 --> 37:48.867
before I bust a cap
in your head?

37:51.703 --> 37:52.804
I can't make them out.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.973
Just keep dialing.
(speed dialing)

37:55.006 --> 37:57.008
This is stupid, Derek.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.310
What a waste.

37:58.344 --> 37:59.445
What you did to Hunter
was a waste!

37:59.478 --> 38:00.512
Man, it was business.

38:00.546 --> 38:01.547
He was going to
bring the whole

38:01.580 --> 38:02.581
damn label down.
(phone ringing)

38:06.117 --> 38:07.453
(ringing continues)
What about Nina, huh?

38:08.554 --> 38:10.021
That hurt me, too.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.423
All right, but...

38:11.457 --> 38:13.392
the ball was in motion.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.327
(ringing)
I couldn't stop it.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.437
He's got something in his hand!

38:25.471 --> 38:27.339
No, it's okay! Don't shoot!

38:27.373 --> 38:28.407
It's just a recorder!

38:30.476 --> 38:31.877
I got it.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.945
I got it all.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.314
Get out of the car! Get out!

38:38.850 --> 38:41.086
(chuckles):
What'd you think I was gonna do?

38:42.721 --> 38:43.855
It's okay.
(groans)

38:45.757 --> 38:47.659
You did good.

38:49.761 --> 38:52.063
COLBY:
Hey, you been at the hospital?

38:52.097 --> 38:54.900
Yeah. Guy's either
tough or lucky,

38:54.933 --> 38:56.835
or maybe he's a little bit
of both, but, uh...

38:56.868 --> 38:59.004
he's gonna pull
on through.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.105
No way of getting around

39:00.138 --> 39:01.607
what he did, though.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.641
He's definitely going away.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.376
Not forever, though.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.977
Yeah.

39:08.547 --> 39:09.915
I'll catch up
with you later.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.419
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.487
So I just got off the phone
with your girlfriend

39:15.521 --> 39:16.655
- in the U.S. Attorney's Office.
- Oh, did you?

39:16.688 --> 39:18.457
She's putting together
a deal for 2BY4.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.958
- What's he got?
- Says he has

39:19.991 --> 39:21.693
info on Blanchard's
drug business.

39:21.727 --> 39:23.161
Time will tell.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.096
All right.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.401
What's the matter?
You worried about Megan?

39:29.435 --> 39:30.869
I don't know.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.538
I mean, she'll be back
tomorrow, we'll see.

39:32.571 --> 39:35.441
Probably just needed
a little break.

39:35.474 --> 39:36.942
Everybody does
once in a while.

39:38.176 --> 39:40.479
Hey, guys, so David's
bailing on me.

39:40.512 --> 39:41.780
Anyone up for grabbing a beer?

39:41.813 --> 39:43.749
Oh, I would,

39:43.782 --> 39:45.083
but I'm hooking
up with Robin.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.086
Leaves just the two of us,

39:48.119 --> 39:50.422
huh, Granger?

39:50.456 --> 39:52.023
Well, go for it.
He's not going

39:52.057 --> 39:53.692
- to mess with you.
- Yeah, I'm just heading out

39:53.725 --> 39:55.861
to this little dive
honky-tonk in the valley.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.729
You know, me and my peeps.

39:57.763 --> 40:00.532
Ah! All right,
curiosity's killing me.

40:00.566 --> 40:01.533
All right, I'm in.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.502
All right.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.040
Okay. Here we go.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.542
What is this?

40:10.576 --> 40:12.110
- You baked us cookies?
- Yes.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.479
- I did.
- Aw.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.581
Because I feel...

40:15.614 --> 40:17.082
ALAN: Amita, you don't have to
pay

40:17.115 --> 40:18.484
penance for what happened
at dinner last night.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.085
It wasn't your fault.
(knocking)

40:20.118 --> 40:22.120
Oh, now, Dad, don't let
her off the hook so easy.

40:22.153 --> 40:24.556
My abject suffering is worth
a lot more than cookies.

40:24.590 --> 40:25.591
I don't know, Charlie.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.925
These cookies are awfully good.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.460
Thank you, Alan.

40:28.494 --> 40:30.496
- Charlie.
- Hey. Uh, yeah, come on in.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.233
Hi. What are you guys
doing here?

40:35.266 --> 40:37.536
Amita, we wanted
to talk to you

40:37.569 --> 40:38.904
before we flew out again.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.205
Charlie, I think we should give
them some privacy.

40:40.238 --> 40:42.708
- No, no, that's okay. Stay.
- No problem at all.

40:42.741 --> 40:43.909
Actually, I wanted
to apologize

40:43.942 --> 40:46.578
to everyone
for how awkward

40:46.612 --> 40:48.514
- things were last night.
- But, Mom, the problem

40:48.547 --> 40:50.048
isn't that things were awkward.

40:50.081 --> 40:52.250
The problem is that you tried
to set me up with Kapil.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.486
Kapil comes
from a wonderful family,

40:54.520 --> 40:56.622
and we've known
his parents a long time.

40:56.655 --> 40:57.422
CHARLIE:
I'm sorry, but you're lobbying

40:57.455 --> 41:00.125
for Kapil right here
in my house.

41:00.158 --> 41:01.827
No, not at all.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.662
What Tapti was going
to say is that

41:03.695 --> 41:05.096
we arranged for Kapil
to be there,

41:05.130 --> 41:07.232
and, yes, it was
our intention.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.234
But this was
before we met Charlie.

41:10.602 --> 41:11.737
And that's your defense?

41:11.770 --> 41:13.138
That's a pretty good defense,

41:13.171 --> 41:14.272
when you think about it.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.608
Until last night,

41:16.642 --> 41:19.778
we didn't realize how well
you'd done for yourself.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.548
Thank you.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.583
Why don't we all
just come in and sit down?

41:24.616 --> 41:26.585
We would, Alan,
but we can't.

41:26.618 --> 41:27.886
- Our flight's early.
- Yeah.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.020
Okay, well,
I'll walk you guys out, then.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.055
- Yes.
- Hey, listen, it was

41:30.088 --> 41:31.523
really nice to finally

41:31.557 --> 41:32.624
meet both of you.

41:32.658 --> 41:33.458
All right.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.761
- Have a safe flight.
- Thank you.

41:35.794 --> 41:38.063
Yeah, once again,
even briefly.

41:38.096 --> 41:39.598
- Good night.
- Good-bye.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.570
- So what do you think?
- Hmm?

41:44.603 --> 41:45.971
- I'm in?
- Oh, yeah, you're in.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.739
Yeah, but you must realize,
of course,

41:47.773 --> 41:49.675
that now you have to marry her.

41:51.877 --> 41:54.112
I think I'll have
one of those cookies now.
