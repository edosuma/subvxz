00:00.960 --> 00:05.260
[upbeat music]

00:05.360 --> 00:06.940
- Chapter one.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.460
This is the story
of the Hayworth family.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.420
- Oh, no.
- Oh!

00:10.520 --> 00:12.020
- Three siblings who loved
each other.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.180
- What do I owe you?
- $1,150, brother.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.540
- Oh, dang.
- Okay.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.700
But money sometimes got
in the way.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.100
Sarah was the middle child

00:18.200 --> 00:19.780
and the one
with the least money.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.580
She lived in a tiny apartment
with her wife, Denise,

00:21.680 --> 00:22.940
and their two kids.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.860
They were always on top
of each other.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.460
Literally.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.940
- Hi, I was just calling
about the counselor position.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.540
Oh, you got the job.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.300
So you were supposed
to fill the position,

00:34.400 --> 00:35.820
but you gave it to yourself.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.140
That's fun.
Quick question.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.860
Why did you even have me
come in?

00:38.960 --> 00:40.660
I mean, you didn't even
validate my parking, so--

00:40.760 --> 00:42.420
- And we are so happy for you.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.500
It's a tough job market
out there right now.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.180
Good luck, and let us know
if anything else opens up.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.540
- Can I just say
one more thing?

00:47.640 --> 00:49.060
- There is a better job
out there for you.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.580
In the meantime, do you want
to bake some cookies

00:51.680 --> 00:53.100
and look at pictures
of Cate Blanchett in suits?

00:53.200 --> 00:55.020
- [laughs]
Yes, I would.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.700
- I thought we were going
to Uncle Connor's place.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.100
- Yeah, his house has
a second floor.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.940
- We have a second floor.
- You're sitting on it!

01:02.040 --> 01:03.740
- A few minutes away,

01:03.840 --> 01:06.100
Sarah's younger brother Connor
had moved to the Bay Area

01:06.200 --> 01:07.420
with his wife and daughter.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.100
He'd made a fortune
in finance,

01:09.200 --> 01:10.940
so much that he bought
his house from Matt Damon.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.780
Yes, that Matt Damon.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.740
They even had a live-in nanny.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.020
- Lupe, can you do the thing?

01:19.120 --> 01:21.660
- A nanny who took care of all
of them.

01:21.760 --> 01:22.900
- [laughs]

01:23.000 --> 01:24.420
- Daddy, when do the cousins
get here?

01:24.520 --> 01:27.060
- Soon, baby.
Today's gonna be epic.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.700
Whole family together...
- Yeah, it's gonna be lit.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.220
- That's my girl.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.020
Lupe.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.420
Come on.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.260
You're the best, Lupe!

01:36.360 --> 01:38.620
- In between Connor and Sarah
financially

01:38.720 --> 01:40.180
was the oldest sibling,

01:40.280 --> 01:42.060
Tom.

01:42.160 --> 01:46.300
He was middle-class, but
definitely not middlebrow.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.180
[toddler babbling]

01:48.280 --> 01:50.420
What?

01:50.520 --> 01:52.060
- Yeah, you know what?
You're right.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.820
It's the wrong kind of funny.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.660
- [babbles]
- Good point.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.020
Tom grew up the golden child
of the family,

01:59.120 --> 02:01.060
and actually became
a bestselling novelist.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.300
But his latest novel had sold
about five copies,

02:03.400 --> 02:05.620
as the public had failed
to appreciate its subtlety,

02:05.720 --> 02:09.900
and the author photo was not
the one the author chose.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.140
With the expenses piling up,
he now faced the humiliation

02:13.240 --> 02:16.220
of having to ask
his little brother for a loan.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.740
- [laughs]

02:19.840 --> 02:21.220
- What, you're a critic, too?

02:21.320 --> 02:22.860
- Mom!

02:22.960 --> 02:25.020
- Also...
- I'm bored!

02:25.120 --> 02:27.540
- He had too many kids.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.140
- Investigators said
they'd never seen

02:29.240 --> 02:30.620
a murder so gruesome,

02:30.720 --> 02:32.580
but what they found
under the floorboards

02:32.680 --> 02:34.380
was even more disturbing.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.820
- Well, got in almost half
a page

02:36.920 --> 02:38.300
before they started crying.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.580
- Your secret book about
Uncle Connor and Aunt Sarah?

02:40.680 --> 02:42.580
- Oh, no, no, no, sweetie.
It's not a secret.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.220
I'm just--I'm...

02:44.320 --> 02:46.300
hiding it from them.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.100
- Que gallina es tu papá?

02:48.200 --> 02:50.620
- Mom said you're a chicken.
- [gasps]

02:50.720 --> 02:53.860
- Well, that's just
nasty in two languages.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.780
Don't forget, we're going
to Connor's at 3:00.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.260
- Great, that'll give me
enough time

02:58.360 --> 03:01.140
to keep doing laundry
for the rest of my life.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.540
- Love you, honey!

03:02.640 --> 03:06.060
Yo, bro, comma, psyched
to see your new dump,

03:06.160 --> 03:07.820
exclamation point.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.260
Smiley face.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.860
- Yeah, did you buy it
from someone famous?

03:10.960 --> 03:12.420
I can't remember.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.160
- Ha ha, very funny.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.460
You do know it was
Matt Damon though, right?

03:18.560 --> 03:19.580
- [chuckles]

03:19.680 --> 03:21.880
[upbeat music]

03:23.960 --> 03:25.460
[upbeat music]

03:25.560 --> 03:27.380
- I wouldn't want someplace
this big--it's too big!

03:27.480 --> 03:29.620
I mean, who would want
all this space?

03:29.720 --> 03:32.540
So many rooms, no one would
ever find you.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.860
- I'm going for it.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.060
I'm just gonna look him
right in the eye.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.460
I'm gonna say "Connor,

03:37.560 --> 03:39.180
I know everyone thinks
my career is thriving--"

03:39.280 --> 03:42.260
- Honey, I support you whether
you decide to ask for the loan

03:42.360 --> 03:44.540
or you don't, but I just can't
keep hearing about it.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.780
- It's hard to ask
your baby brother for money.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.660
- Well, don't think of him
as your baby brother.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.380
Think of him as a cartoon duck

03:50.480 --> 03:52.540
swimming in a pool
of gold coins.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.060
- He has a pool of gold coins?

03:55.160 --> 03:57.220
- No.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.740
I don't think so.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.700
- Hey!
- Hi.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.300
- Hey.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.300
- So are we still not telling
your brothers

04:05.400 --> 04:06.340
that you lost your job?

04:06.440 --> 04:07.740
- Not today, no.
- Okay.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.020
- Oh, your cheese cave
has a wine cellar?

04:10.120 --> 04:12.060
Cool, I'm unemployed.
- Okay.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.380
- I just--I don't need
Tom's advice

04:13.480 --> 04:15.660
or Connor's sympathy fist bump.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.060
- Okay, Lulu, we haven't seen
Connor in over a year,

04:18.160 --> 04:19.380
so maybe let's not get
in a fight

04:19.480 --> 04:20.740
and storm out this time.

04:20.840 --> 04:22.180
Okay, I know your brothers
are Scorpios,

04:22.280 --> 04:23.660
but they're still good people.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.020
- You know I don't believe
in that stuff.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.100
- That's a very Capricorn thing
to say.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.860
- Okay.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.180
- Oh, wow, look!

04:30.280 --> 04:32.280
- Dibs on tiny Porsche!

04:34.120 --> 04:35.660
- Ready for this?
- Do I have a choice?

04:35.760 --> 04:37.300
- No.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.300
[screaming]

04:39.400 --> 04:41.340
- Oh, my God!

04:41.440 --> 04:42.860
- Hey.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.380
- Oh, my gosh, come on,
you have to see my dolls.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.820
- Cool, what are
their pronouns?

04:45.920 --> 04:47.500
- Come on!
- Whoa!

04:47.600 --> 04:49.820
- So cool!
- Oh, thank you.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.940
- You got it, right?
- Yeah.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.100
[light percussive music]

04:55.200 --> 04:56.340
- De dónde eres?

04:56.440 --> 04:57.500
- Colombiana, y tú?

04:57.600 --> 04:58.780
- Quería, Mexicana.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.580
- Nobody's perfect.
- Oh.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.380
- Okay.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.740
- This is obscene.
- I feel dirty.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.940
- So what do you guys think?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.540
- So nice.
- It's really tasteful.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.220
- Mm-hmm.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.860
- I can't believe I'm finally
so close to you guys.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.580
We went stir-crazy in Seattle
this past year.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.660
- Ugh, I'm sure it was so hard
for you and Emily

05:16.760 --> 05:18.740
to be quarantined
with an infinity pool.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.580
- No, my pool guy blew up
on TikTok.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.740
So he's like a full-time
pool boy influencer now,

05:24.840 --> 05:27.140
just doing all like, you know,
this kinda...

05:27.240 --> 05:29.180
I don't know, but we had
to throw the tarp on.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.860
The pH balance got all out
of whack.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.340
It's--
- Ugh, I'd move, too.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.820
- Hey, where is Emily?
She traveling for work again?

05:35.920 --> 05:38.580
- Yeah, her firm owns
a pipeline

05:38.680 --> 05:41.300
in one of the Dakotas.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.380
I don't know.
Someone's got to pay the bills.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.340
- Didn't you make,
like, $5 million last year?

05:46.440 --> 05:49.580
- Yeah, but Em makes,
like, real money.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.860
- I don't even want to know
what you think real money is.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.420
- Oh, Tom, by the way,
finally read your book.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.780
- You did?

05:56.880 --> 05:58.580
- Yeah--well, first chapter,
but, man.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.780
So far I got to say it is...

06:01.880 --> 06:04.540
a much anticipated follow-up.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.420
- We talk about how problematic
it is?

06:06.520 --> 06:07.820
- Oh, should I not read it?

06:07.920 --> 06:09.700
- Well, there's exactly
zero women.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.940
- It's about
a prison baseball team in 1906.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.220
- That sounds dope.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.340
- I thought you read
the first chapter.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.900
- It's a long chapter, Tom.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.060
- Look, Sarah, obviously I'm
an ally.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.180
- Yeah, Sarah, he married
a Latina.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.380
Doesn't he get points for that?

06:22.480 --> 06:23.900
- I didn't actually do it
for points.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.260
- Just the idea of points
is so toxic.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.440
- Okay, well definitely not
less points.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.300
- Fewer points.
- You have a problem.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.480
- Oh, my God, we get it.
You're a bestselling writer.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.740
- And this is the playroom.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.660
- Huh, okay, whoo.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.260
- Wow.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.940
- Shamiah, you got all the
orange and all the railroads.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.740
Guys, let me save you
six hours.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.540
Shamiah's already won the game.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.460
- All right!
- But I've got both utilities.

06:53.560 --> 06:56.220
- [sighs]
Oh, Camila.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.700
All that means is that you just
spent $300

06:58.800 --> 07:00.900
on investments
with zero upgrade potential.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.580
Let me guess, you got Baltic,
too?

07:02.680 --> 07:04.020
Yeah, you got Baltic.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.580
- It's like
a Willy Wonka fever dream.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.900
- It's like an American Girl
store knocked up a Sephora.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.540
- It's like we're inside
Barbie's uterus.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.380
- It's like a rave
meets an ice cream shop,

07:13.480 --> 07:15.100
and they...

07:15.200 --> 07:16.180
I lost it.
- You tried.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.260
- Yeah, I lost it.
- You tried.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.700
- You got a lot of cash.
That's good.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.120
But it's not like the bank
is gonna pay you interest.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.860
- Go off, king.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.460
- Thank you, Kelvin.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.780
But let's talk about
your situation over here, bud.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.060
I mean, what's your strategy?
You're all over the place.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.500
The name of the game
is Monopoly.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.540
I'm seeing one of each color.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.220
- In chapter three,
add a flashback

07:35.320 --> 07:37.260
where Connor's greed is stoked
by Monopoly,

07:37.360 --> 07:39.140
a game which is ironically
designed to teach

07:39.240 --> 07:41.240
about income inequality.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.580
I'm writing a book.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.500
- Hm, I'm making
chicken fingers.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.860
- Yo, Tom, we're gonna call
Mom and Dad.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.300
And this is the kitchen.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.140
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.460
- We love it.
- Yes.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.100
- Is that Matt Damon's juicer?

08:00.200 --> 08:01.580
- Hey, what's he like?

08:01.680 --> 08:03.620
- Who, MD?
Oh, he was great.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.620
Yeah, I mean, when my realtor
emailed his realtor

08:06.720 --> 08:09.940
about the inspection,
he responded like, so fast.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.780
- Wow.
- That is so Matt Damon.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.260
- And to think you and Tom
shared that tiny little room

08:15.360 --> 08:17.340
growing up together.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.780
My millionaire
and my big shot writer.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.900
- Hi, I'm here, too.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.860
- Of course, you are.
How's work, sweetie?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.700
- Oh, so great.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.100
- Oh, I love seeing all
of you together.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.060
My kids, my grandkids,

08:31.160 --> 08:33.420
my wonderful ethnic
daughter-in-laws.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.780
- Mom, why would you say that?
- Mom, come on.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.100
- What?
They know I love them.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.100
Hola, Marina.
Café con leche.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.060
- That's right, Grandma.
Those are Spanish words.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.900
- Hey, mom.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.740
I know that Thanksgiving
is a couple months off,

08:46.840 --> 08:49.220
but I would like to try again
with the vegan turkey.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.500
I think the problem last time
was mostly in the taste

08:51.600 --> 08:53.220
and the texture area.

08:53.320 --> 08:56.140
- Oh, Sarah...

08:56.240 --> 08:58.180
- Okay, fine,
there was a slight odor.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.780
- I thought you told them.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.300
- No, Connor, you were
supposed to tell them.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.420
- Told us what?

09:04.520 --> 09:07.180
- Connor's taking us
to the Turks and the Caicos!

09:07.280 --> 09:08.660
- What?

09:08.760 --> 09:10.420
- I don't understand.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.220
- She said it wrong.
There's no "the."

09:12.320 --> 09:13.660
- Dad.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.140
- He's taking us
to Turks and Caicos?

09:15.240 --> 09:16.860
- No, the one "the" is fine.

09:16.960 --> 09:17.800
- But we always have
Thanksgiving

09:17.880 --> 09:19.380
at Mom and Dad's place.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.380
- Yeah, it's a tradition.
- It's like our only tradition.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.340
- So you're saying
it's Turks and the Caicos.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.580
That sounds crazy.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.100
- Guys, we'll call you back.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.200
- Now you got me confused.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.220
- What, I can't take
Mom and Dad on a vacation?

09:32.320 --> 09:34.460
- Connor, there's
51 other weeks of the year.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.340
- Okay, but on Thanksgiving,
all we do is fight.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.940
Why do you guys even care?

09:39.040 --> 09:40.860
- Because it's our special day
of fighting.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.180
- And it's our special day
of drinking.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.100
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, I'll fix this.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.020
You guys wanna come
to Turks and Caicos?

09:46.120 --> 09:47.860
I'll bring everyone.
- That's not the point.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.260
- Yeah, you're not getting it,
man.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.060
So just airfare or you cover
hotel, too?

09:52.160 --> 09:53.100
- Everything.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.200
- Whew.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.900
- Tom.
- What? No.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.420
No, no, no.
Yeah, no, Sarah's right.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.700
That's not the point.
- Okay, Connor, you know?

10:01.800 --> 10:03.620
I didn't say anything

10:03.720 --> 10:06.420
about your ridiculous
Matt Damon house

10:06.520 --> 10:08.140
with its screening room,
and a backyard

10:08.240 --> 10:10.020
that's inside the house,
and a closet

10:10.120 --> 10:12.180
just for your kid's pajamas.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.620
- It's a lot of pajama.
- You know what?

10:13.720 --> 10:14.940
- Should we check out
the Japanese soaking tub?

10:15.040 --> 10:16.100
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.540
- Okay?
Kelvin! Shamiah!

10:18.640 --> 10:20.060
- Sarah!
- Come on.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.140
- Well, she lasted an hour.
I owe Shamiah ten bucks.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.620
- After the year we've all had!

10:23.720 --> 10:25.660
- It was so great seeing
all of you,

10:25.760 --> 10:27.760
and she's gonna be back
for one more zing.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.860
- And Matt Damon hasn't made
a good movie

10:31.960 --> 10:33.700
since "We Bought a Zoo."

10:33.800 --> 10:35.100
- And we're done.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.740
Okay, Marina, I'm gonna send
you that link

10:36.840 --> 10:38.580
to the seven-minute workout,
and Connor,

10:38.680 --> 10:40.020
welcome to the city.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.740
- Thank you.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.840
[electronic music]

10:45.280 --> 10:47.280
- Wait, did she say
"We Bought a Zoo"?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.580
- Why did we have to leave?

10:50.680 --> 10:52.460
- I didn't even get to drive
the Bentley

10:52.560 --> 10:54.540
- So, Lulu, to recap--
- Please, no recap.

10:54.640 --> 10:55.620
- You said
you weren't gonna storm out,

10:55.720 --> 10:57.720
and then what happened?

10:58.720 --> 10:59.860
- I stormed out.
- Yeah.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.140
But I can tell you're
reconsidering

11:01.240 --> 11:03.340
because we haven't left yet.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.420
- No. I forgot the keys inside,
and I'm too embarrassed

11:06.520 --> 11:08.260
to go back in and get them.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.820
I think they're
on the towel warmer

11:09.920 --> 11:11.020
next to the robot toilet.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.100
- Didn't get to use that
either.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
[knock on the window]

11:20.840 --> 11:23.500
- Found these over
by the Sokito 5000.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.020
You know it's got
a built-in Bluetooth?

11:25.120 --> 11:26.380
- I've got to poop in that.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.620
- Look, I know you and Tom
were upset.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.180
But when we were kids,

11:30.280 --> 11:32.020
did we solve our problems
by running away?

11:32.120 --> 11:33.180
No.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.740
We'd figure it out.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.660
And then we'd make up
by singing our favorite song.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.500
You know?
♪ Mmm bop ♪

11:39.600 --> 11:41.580
♪ Mmm, mmm, mmm bop ♪

11:41.680 --> 11:43.020
♪ Duba du duba du ♪

11:43.120 --> 11:44.700
- Okay, stop,
you're butchering it.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.580
- Look, I don't want her to go,

11:46.680 --> 11:48.820
but make it a lot easier
to ask Connor for that loan.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.740
Unless this puts him
in a bad mood.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.300
- If you don't want to ask him
for the loan,

11:52.400 --> 11:54.380
I could always go back to work
at the firm.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.900
- I thought you hated
the firm.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.220
- I hate a lot of things, Tom,
yet here I am.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.900
- Come on, I've got
this whole day planned out.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.620
Let's just go inside.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.780
- I mean, he usually doesn't
put this much effort in.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.380
And that toilet sounds
really cool.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.020
- Yes, obviously we all want
to poop in that toilet.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.580
- Let's go talk.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.680
I've got the perfect room
where we can work this out.

12:16.399 --> 12:19.416
[quirky music]

12:19.516 --> 12:22.893
- Okay, so you meant
literally work it out.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.292
- This is where I do
my best thinking.

12:24.392 --> 12:25.571
- This is great.

12:25.671 --> 12:26.890
I haven't been to a gym
in eight months.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.768
- You guys can use it anytime
you want.

12:28.868 --> 12:30.326
Just wipe off the equipment
when you're done.

12:30.426 --> 12:31.885
- What's that smell?

12:31.985 --> 12:33.923
- Oh, Matt Damon used to use
this room to dry meat.

12:34.023 --> 12:35.642
Yeah, after "Monuments Men,"

12:35.742 --> 12:37.320
he got real
into German cuisine.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.278
- Okay, next time
just say sweat.

12:39.378 --> 12:41.357
- Look, Connor.
Connor.

12:41.457 --> 12:43.874
The reason why I'm upset
about Thanksgiving

12:43.974 --> 12:45.873
is that you didn't even
consult us.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.871
It just feels like,
since I make less money--

12:47.971 --> 12:49.709
- Well, fewer money.

12:49.809 --> 12:51.308
Right, Tom?

12:51.408 --> 12:53.825
- It feels like my opinion
matters less.

12:53.925 --> 12:57.702
- Look, I'm sorry I have like
a ridiculous amount of money.

12:57.802 --> 12:58.861
You want me to give it all
away?

12:58.961 --> 13:00.300
I'll give it all away.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.057
Obviously not all of it.
That'd be crazy.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.975
- Come on, ask him.
- No, now is not the time.

13:06.075 --> 13:07.973
- This is exactly the time.
- Hey, what's up?

13:08.073 --> 13:09.691
- Hi.
- No secrets in the meat room.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.290
Spit it out.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.808
- Well...
- It--

13:13.908 --> 13:17.204
We're actually having
a sexual problem.

13:17.304 --> 13:18.683
- Ew.
- What?

13:18.783 --> 13:19.702
- I agree, we probably
shouldn't talk about it

13:19.782 --> 13:21.161
in front of other people.

13:21.261 --> 13:22.680
- We need to borrow money,
but Tom's afraid to ask.

13:22.780 --> 13:23.799
- What?
- You do?

13:23.899 --> 13:26.356
- No, no, no, no.
Look.

13:26.456 --> 13:28.514
I know everyone thinks
that my career is thriving,

13:28.614 --> 13:30.073
but the tru--ahh!

13:30.173 --> 13:31.791
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

13:31.891 --> 13:32.870
- Tom.

13:32.970 --> 13:35.068
- I'm good.
I'm good.

13:35.168 --> 13:36.867
I'm okay.
I just--

13:36.967 --> 13:38.905
I hurt my elbow a little bit.

13:39.005 --> 13:41.003
And my face.

13:42.162 --> 13:45.060
- Wait, you need to borrow
money, why didn't you just ask?

13:45.160 --> 13:48.217
- I've been trying,
but it's embarrassing.

13:48.317 --> 13:50.575
It makes me feel
like a failure.

13:50.675 --> 13:52.853
Nobody bought my last book.

13:52.953 --> 13:54.951
- But the first three pages
were so good.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.287
- I don't know what happened
to my life.

13:59.387 --> 14:02.164
I mean, I was the A student,
right?

14:02.264 --> 14:04.762
I'm the one who went
to an Ivy League school.

14:04.862 --> 14:06.281
- Well...
- Cornell.

14:06.381 --> 14:09.078
- I'm almost 40 and clipping
supermarket coupons

14:09.178 --> 14:11.076
while my younger brother
subscribes to a magazine

14:11.176 --> 14:13.194
about private jets.

14:13.294 --> 14:15.233
- I don't subscribe
to that, Tom.

14:15.333 --> 14:17.111
They send that for free.

14:17.211 --> 14:19.868
- Every month
we fall further behind.

14:19.968 --> 14:22.546
And three kids
are not cheap.

14:22.646 --> 14:25.224
- Okay, I'm sorry that you're
going through this,

14:25.324 --> 14:28.141
but you are not the only one
who's struggling.

14:28.241 --> 14:30.059
- Okay, Lulu,
it's not a competition.

14:30.159 --> 14:32.297
- And we could really
use the help.

14:32.397 --> 14:34.895
- Well, we could also
use the help.

14:34.995 --> 14:36.493
- Oh, I thought you said
it's not a competition.

14:36.593 --> 14:38.332
- Well, Marina, you're
a corporate lawyer,

14:38.432 --> 14:39.890
and I'm a public school
teacher,

14:39.990 --> 14:41.889
and my savings account
is a mug.

14:41.989 --> 14:44.087
- I'm not working anymore,
and you two have dual income,

14:44.187 --> 14:46.285
and we just have Tom's
$12 royalty checks.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.643
Sorry, honey.

14:47.743 --> 14:48.842
- We don't have dual income
anymore

14:48.942 --> 14:50.281
because I lost my job
last week.

14:50.381 --> 14:51.560
- Ooh.

14:51.660 --> 14:54.038
- They fired you from the...

14:54.138 --> 14:56.516
- The school thing.
- The school thing?

14:56.616 --> 14:57.555
- Do you even know what I do?

14:57.655 --> 14:58.953
- Yeah.
- Yes.

14:59.053 --> 15:00.832
- You're like a child--
- You do guidance--

15:00.932 --> 15:02.470
- Research.
- Counseling.

15:02.570 --> 15:04.988
- I'm a therapist
for low-income, at-risk kids.

15:05.088 --> 15:06.626
- Yes, you are.
- Yeah.

15:06.726 --> 15:07.925
- That's what I just said.
- That is exactly what you do.

15:08.005 --> 15:09.264
- I wish I'd known
you were unemployed

15:09.364 --> 15:10.263
before I asked for a loan.

15:10.363 --> 15:11.862
Now I feel like a jerk.

15:11.962 --> 15:14.499
- Oh, I'm sorry that the timing
of my getting laid off

15:14.599 --> 15:15.898
was inconvenient for you.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.377
- That's not what I--
- Guys.

15:17.477 --> 15:19.535
We're family, okay.
It's not a big deal.

15:19.635 --> 15:21.014
I can float you both.

15:21.114 --> 15:22.532
- Connor, I don't want
your money, okay?

15:22.632 --> 15:24.610
Not from big pharma, fossil
fuels, or blood diamonds--

15:24.710 --> 15:25.849
- Okay, okay.

15:25.949 --> 15:26.928
- But Tom shouldn't get it
either.

15:27.028 --> 15:28.167
- Whoa!

15:28.267 --> 15:29.086
- Oh, that's
a healthy attitude.

15:29.186 --> 15:30.525
- How is that not toxic?

15:30.625 --> 15:32.763
- Oh, the golden boy hits
his first speed bump

15:32.863 --> 15:34.242
and immediately asks
for a bailout?

15:34.342 --> 15:35.720
I mean, white privilege much?

15:35.820 --> 15:37.079
- Mm-mm.
- I'm sorry, I heard it.

15:37.179 --> 15:39.197
- Guys, can we please,
for once, just not fight?

15:39.297 --> 15:40.436
- I don't think
that's possible.

15:40.536 --> 15:41.415
- I've been asking that
for 13 years.

15:41.495 --> 15:42.594
- Honestly, it's a good thing

15:42.694 --> 15:43.534
that we're canceling
Thanksgiving.

15:43.613 --> 15:45.032
- Guys.
