WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.717
I'm Danny Rubin,
and I'm running for State Assembly.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.594
-Daddy, TV!
-This is my beautiful wife, Sheila,

00:10.677 --> 00:13.222
-and our daughter, Maya.
-That's right, sweetie. Daddy's on TV.

00:13.305 --> 00:16.600
Did you hear that, babe? She said,
"Daddy, TV." Is that cute or what?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.227
-Save Our Wave…
-Huh? Yeah. It's cute.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.145
Hey, babe.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.147
You did this.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.316
Credit where credit's due.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.028
That's probably one of your fans.

00:28.904 --> 00:30.197
Let's see.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.365
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.867
Is this Rubin for assembly headquarters?

00:33.951 --> 00:35.494
May I ask who's calling, please?

00:35.577 --> 00:38.163
Certainly.
This is Maggie from KTSD Accounting.

00:38.247 --> 00:39.498
How are you doing today?

00:40.541 --> 00:41.542
I'm well.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.627
We had a problem
with the check you sent for payment.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.420
It looks like it got returned to us.

00:47.005 --> 00:51.009
That must have been
a clerical mistake on our end.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.428
We'll send another one out to you
right away.

00:53.512 --> 00:56.139
Great. If you wouldn't mind
sending that as soon as possible

00:56.223 --> 00:59.685
so we can avoid having to pull the ad
off the air, that would be terrific.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.437
We'll take care of this right away.
I'm so sorry for the mix-up.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.498
That bitch is gonna love this.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.342
Tanya, it's Sheila.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.511
Sheil, hi. Did you hear I was pregnant?

01:34.595 --> 01:41.518
Oh, yes. I got your card.
It's beautiful. The house, you.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.145
Oh, my God. I know, right?

01:43.228 --> 01:45.230
I'm just so happy for you both.

01:45.314 --> 01:49.735
Life is sweet. Life is sweet.
And how are you and Danny doing?

01:49.818 --> 01:55.032
Not so good. Thank you for asking.
Danny and I could really use your help.

01:57.534 --> 02:01.914
We hate LA.
We're LA haters. At least we were.

02:01.997 --> 02:05.709
Yeah, we still are. LA is the land
of the phonies and the sellouts.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.628
And we have three events
on this weekend already.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.341
Like the Pacific Beach weenie roast
that five people showed up to?

02:12.424 --> 02:14.218
Those were five voters.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.763
Nobody in LA can even vote for you,
even if they could read the ballot.

02:17.846 --> 02:21.308
I think Jer's got a point here, babe.
I mean, the clock is ticking.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.102
Time is running out,
and I'm wasting that time, you know,

02:24.186 --> 02:27.231
shaking hands and kissing babies
outside the constituency.

02:27.314 --> 02:32.277
Listen, you wanna go to La-La Land
and hang with Loni Anderson, be my guest.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.488
But wait until you've been elected.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.532
All right?
Right now it's just a distraction.

02:36.615 --> 02:39.159
You are not letting
that hippie turd derail this.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.411
Hey, I don't like the place
any more than you do,

02:41.495 --> 02:44.039
but LA is where the big money is.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.333
We can make more in one night
at Jack and Tanya's

02:46.416 --> 02:49.002
than we can in a month
of San Diego weenie roasts.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.172
It's a better use of your time and energy.

02:52.256 --> 02:54.758
We're just building some momentum.
We can't stop now.

02:55.801 --> 02:56.802
Okay!

02:59.137 --> 03:01.390
Great workout, guys.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.395
Hey, dude! I mean, sup?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.940
Just, you know, you haven't been by,
like, in a little bit.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.442
Yeah. Sorry about that, Tyler.

03:12.943 --> 03:16.405
My tape guy's set to dupe us more copies
as soon as we nail down the cover art.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.782
So I was playing around
with a couple options.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.201
Are you stoked on either of these. I--

03:21.785 --> 03:24.246
Feel free to be just, like, super honest.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.712
But you don't have to go
out of your way to be hurtful.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.756
-These are great.
-Seriously?

03:36.175 --> 03:37.176
That means…

03:38.802 --> 03:41.013
I mean, that feels rad that you like them.

03:41.597 --> 03:44.808
-Yeah, especially this one.
-That's by far my fave as well.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.895
If I'm being fully honest,
this other one is total dog shit.

03:48.395 --> 03:52.482
I mean, it's just not what I expected.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.193
It's-- It's very cool.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.946
Two grand should cover the first run.
Four if we're feeling good.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.157
These things are gonna sell like hot…

04:00.240 --> 04:01.575
You don't have two grand.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.577
You barely have two nickels
to rub together.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.661
What are you thinking?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.747
So, I'm actually out of town
for a few days.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.124
-I was hoping that Bunny can--
-You're leaving.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.045
That makes sense.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.130
-Yeah, just for a few days.
-Yeah, Bun.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.214
For a few days.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.926
And when I get back,
we'll get things rolling.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.261
Yeah, Bun. When she gets back.

04:21.345 --> 04:24.056
-Motherfucking piece of shit.
-Here you go, hon.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.560
I already got it, but thanks.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.687
My pleasure.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.855
You packed a lot.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.024
You sure you're just going away
for the weekend?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.484
I like to have options.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.361
And I like to wear underwear. Heard of it?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.571
Gonna go visit your parents
while you're up there?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.826
I'm sure Danny will love that.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.206
I don't talk to my parents.

04:52.251 --> 04:56.171
You know, Danny is smarter
than I am about a lot of things.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.841
Big picture stuff, ideas.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.303
But he's got his blind spots too.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.187
Have a great weekend, Jerry.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.738
What did you do?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.866
If we're gonna do this,
might as well do it right.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.952
-But how much did this cost?
-No, no, relax. Relax.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.328
No, no charge at all.

05:28.412 --> 05:31.456
Yeah, jogging buddy let me borrow it.
I saved his life.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.958
Ended up being an ankle sprain.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.586
But, you know, either way,
I was the one there with the ice, so.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.629
Come on.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.506
Here, come on.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.466
Yeah. You go over there.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.970
-Is this not the best?
-What do you think? You like it?

05:45.053 --> 05:47.055
-Well, I got work to do, so.
-Yeah?

05:47.139 --> 05:48.891
-Have a great trip.
-You do, huh?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.144
All right, Jerry.

05:52.227 --> 05:56.732
Happy birthday to you

05:56.815 --> 05:57.858
Thank you, everybody.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.485
Thank you, darling.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.614
What? You didn't make a wish.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.991
Well, I'm a little old for that now,
don't you think?

06:06.074 --> 06:07.618
You're never too old for a wish.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.702
Fine.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.165
I wish for the continued good health
of my family.

06:13.248 --> 06:16.210
You can't say it out loud.
It's terrible luck.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.337
And this year of all years,

06:18.420 --> 06:21.632
when you're turning the age
when your father was called back.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.676
We are a family of faith,
not superstition,

06:24.760 --> 06:26.720
but there's no reason
not to cover your bases.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.597
Mother. Thank you.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.739
Here. Have some cake.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.367
Anyone else? Cake?

06:49.993 --> 06:51.078
Yeah. I'll have a piece.

06:55.832 --> 07:00.087
Who else? Anyone else? Cake?

07:02.089 --> 07:05.217
You sure you don't have to go potty,
sweetie? Now's your chance.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.011
Hey.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.724
You are beautiful.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.477
What? No, I'm disgusting.

07:15.561 --> 07:18.021
-My hair-- The wind.
-No. No, no, no. It's too late.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.731
You already smiled.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.024
Can't take it back.

07:28.991 --> 07:30.742
You know, none of this is promised.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.621
The water, the land, the sky.

07:36.415 --> 07:39.334
Not unless we take steps now
to protect it for Maya.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.419
So true.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.213
Are you high?

07:43.297 --> 07:45.382
Did you have a puff of grass
when I wasn't looking?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.633
Yeah.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.468
I drive better when I'm high.

07:48.552 --> 07:49.553
Just more focused.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.805
Let me drive.

07:51.889 --> 07:52.890
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.351
-All right. It's up to you.
-Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.153
Just a sec!

08:06.236 --> 08:07.696
All right. Let me in.

08:08.906 --> 08:09.907
Yeah.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.248
-Hey, I'm gonna go for a swim.
-Hey.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.416
You want to come?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.709
I don't think so.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.670
Remind me not to have those chili dogs
they serve at the ninth hole.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.214
They never sit right.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.227
Welcome to paradise, folks.
Watch your step.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.352
So the house was built

08:39.436 --> 08:43.232
by a Holocaust survivor
by the name of Joseph Solokoff.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.942
And after all that darkness he endured,

08:45.025 --> 08:48.820
you can really feel the embrace of light

08:48.904 --> 08:50.781
in his California architectural works,

08:50.864 --> 08:53.283
their sensuality, it's just life itself.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.578
Joni Mitchell lives in a Solokoff.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.372
-It's true.
-We're pretty sure that she does.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.707
It's breathtaking…

09:00.791 --> 09:02.668
…how pretentious you've both become.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.003
How many necklaces is he wearing?

09:05.087 --> 09:06.755
You're gonna wanna keep an eye on Maya.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.173
-Yeah.
-There's no railings.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.717
-That's part of the Solokoff philosophy.
-That's right.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.886
Yeah. Quite a drop you got over there.

09:12.970 --> 09:16.056
I know, I know. Sometimes I get vertigo.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.476
-It's so funny.
-She does. It's actually pretty serious.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.688
We don't-- It's so fun.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.023
I wonder what she'd look like
falling down the canyon,

09:25.107 --> 09:27.150
holding on for dear life,
and then letting go…

09:27.234 --> 09:30.737
Seventy-six feet.
Yeah, and at the bottom, mountain lions.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.656
-What?
-The rest of the world has guard rails.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.241
But not up here.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.243
Here, we're still wild, untamed.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.620
And don't forget unappealing. Ungroomed.

09:38.704 --> 09:43.375
Okay, so every level of the house
has a different view.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.587
Do any of 'em have bathrooms?

09:46.670 --> 09:47.754
They all do.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.340
-They all have bathrooms.
-There's bathrooms.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.135
Well good, 'cause it was a long drive,
and I hope it was worth it.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.803
Okay, I'll be back.

09:54.887 --> 09:55.888
-Come here, honey.
-Okay.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.650
What's up?

10:09.401 --> 10:11.403
-Sup?
-What's happening?

10:11.486 --> 10:13.655
Nada mucho, dude. Dipping, shaping.

10:13.739 --> 10:17.451
-Dude, living the dream, bro.
-In the zone, bro.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.453
So, what's up, man?

10:19.536 --> 10:22.623
You got work for me? We duping?
I'm almost done with my last run.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.541
I could really use the cash flow too.

10:24.625 --> 10:25.751
Nah, sorry.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.754
I've been a little held up
in the cash department.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.839
-Gonna have to wait.
-Dude.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.132
I know, dude.

10:33.175 --> 10:38.138
Well, I guess I gotta call the porn guys
and see if they got any work for me.

10:38.222 --> 10:41.975
I just don't love doing that stuff, man.
I mean, I'm a Christian, bro.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.978
-Hurts the soul.
-I hear you.

10:45.479 --> 10:49.775
I mean, not on the Christian thing,
I'm a Buddhist atheist, but on the soul.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.653
I mean,
I pray like a motherfucker too, dude.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.947
Just, shit just keeps not going my way.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.741
Like a couple weeks ago,
little dude comes in,

10:57.824 --> 10:59.868
orders a 5'8" thruster.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.537
I work on it for weeks.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.580
It's the prettiest one I've ever made.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.415
And then guess what happens?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.626
Little dude disappears. He stiffs me.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.337
I mean, what am I supposed to do
with a 5'8" thruster?

11:15.968 --> 11:18.095
That's my size.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.304
It's all right.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.934
Sadly, though,
I just don't have the dough.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.644
I mean, my old lady would kill me.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.563
We're supposed to be saving up, you know?

11:27.646 --> 11:28.689
It's all cool.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.023
I get it.

11:30.107 --> 11:32.401
We do take credit cards now,
if that helps.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.152
But anyway.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.197
Pot churro? My girlfriend makes 'em.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.616
I gotta do shit today, or I would.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.369
Good choice. It's a good choice.
They're pretty intense.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.205
But anyway. Later, dude.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.456
Christ be with you.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.335
You know what? I--

11:50.836 --> 11:55.132
On the other hand,
they do smell pretty fucking killer.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.302
Dude, help yourself, man.

11:59.636 --> 12:00.888
Thank you again.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.307
It just makes
such a difference to the campaign

12:03.390 --> 12:04.808
that you're helping and doing this.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.351
-It's my pleasure.
-Thank you.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.188
Oh, my God. I can't stop.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.772
I've been so hungry.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.442
Were you like this with Maya?

12:14.026 --> 12:15.194
I think so, yeah.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.278
In this trimester,

12:16.361 --> 12:17.446
I'm so horny.

12:20.032 --> 12:20.908
Poor Jack.

12:20.991 --> 12:25.495
I'm just running him ragged,
begging for sex day and night.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.290
-Do you wanna go over the guest list?
-I don't know if it's to do with

12:28.373 --> 12:31.001
all the extra blood
that's running in my veins or if this is,

12:31.084 --> 12:35.380
like, a normal thing for pregnancy,
but I just feel flush with desire.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.969
Good Lord.
What won't she put in her mouth?

12:41.053 --> 12:43.222
…animal, just sex.

12:43.305 --> 12:46.433
Like, I-- Like, just meat.
You know what I mean?

12:46.517 --> 12:47.768
Meat coming together.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.311
Are you gonna get that?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.105
I didn't hear it.

12:54.900 --> 12:55.901
Hello.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.070
May I ask who's speaking?

12:58.820 --> 13:00.280
Sure. One second.

13:00.364 --> 13:03.033
Sheila, it's for you. It's Jerry.
Someone named Jerry.

13:04.618 --> 13:08.038
Wait, is that Jerry Goldman?
From the Berkeley days? The quad streaker?

13:08.121 --> 13:11.917
-Oh, my God. He's still alive?
-I know.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.085
Wow.

13:13.168 --> 13:16.338
Jer bear, it's Tanya. Yeah.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.382
-Guess what? I'm pregnant.
-Give me.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.801
Hey, Jer.

13:20.884 --> 13:24.137
Hey. Hey, Sheil.
Look, we got a problem, okay?

13:24.221 --> 13:28.267
I've been sitting here
watching the boob tube all damn day,

13:28.350 --> 13:30.310
and I haven't seen our guy.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.312
Well, you probably just missed it.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.398
I've seen the Schmidt schmuck three times.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.150
They haven't played our ad once. Not once.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.069
Do you know what's going on here?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.029
A lot of jerking off, I'm guessing.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.991
That asshole is paying them off, okay?

13:44.074 --> 13:46.952
Giving them double to kill our ad.

13:47.035 --> 13:50.372
So I think I'm gonna go down
to the TV station,

13:50.455 --> 13:51.999
and give them a piece of my mind.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.376
Oh, no, Jerry. No. No. Look. Look.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.337
You're probably right,
but when you get this passionate,

13:57.421 --> 14:01.091
you tend to get into trouble.
Legal trouble.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.176
I know.

14:02.259 --> 14:05.137
We can't risk losing you
at this point in the campaign.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.222
You're too valuable.

14:07.306 --> 14:09.850
I'll talk to them.
I'll see what's going on.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.268
Okay.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.691
Hey, you don't have any hand lotion
in the house, do you?

14:17.774 --> 14:19.109
My hands are dry.

14:19.193 --> 14:21.236
Yeah. Yeah, in the guest bathroom.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.529
Thanks, hon.

14:22.613 --> 14:23.614
Okay.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.867
You called that one.

14:28.076 --> 14:31.413
-I have the thank-you notes done.
-You're so good.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.415
They just need your signature.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.002
I like to get them done right away.

14:37.085 --> 14:40.547
Otherwise, it never seems to happen.
It just gets pushed one day after another.

14:42.841 --> 14:43.717
Were you happy?

14:45.219 --> 14:47.763
-Excuse me?
-With the party.

14:47.846 --> 14:50.474
I tried to make it nice.
I know it looked simple.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.101
You did a tremendous job as always.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.271
Good. Great. I just wanted to make sure.

14:57.648 --> 15:01.527
Because it seemed like
you were burdened emotionally.

15:02.361 --> 15:06.490
Like, there might be stress
in your mind and heart.

15:07.074 --> 15:11.245
Perhaps because of your father
and certain memories.

15:11.328 --> 15:15.082
Thank you, but it's-- it's not about that.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.209
It's about the election.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.294
I have quite a bit
riding on the marina project,

15:19.378 --> 15:22.381
and if we don't win,
it could all be in peril.

15:22.881 --> 15:29.137
So the stress that I'm feeling
is quite real and external.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.182
That's what I thought. Just making sure.

15:45.070 --> 15:48.198
That's gotta be an animal.
That can't be her.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.577
But what animal makes that sound?

15:53.078 --> 15:55.247
We're only a few blocks from Sunset.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.959
Well, if you listen to Jack,
we're in the Serengeti.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.046
Oh, no. That-- That's--

16:04.548 --> 16:05.549
That's all her.

16:07.885 --> 16:09.428
What is he doing to her?

16:11.388 --> 16:12.806
How should I know?

16:14.641 --> 16:18.103
Oh, come on.
That was so long ago. We were kids.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.938
Well, it wasn't that long ago.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.275
How was he?

16:26.195 --> 16:27.321
Unmemorable.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.410
-Okay. Okay, okay.
-Okay, now she's…

16:33.952 --> 16:36.121
She's just embarrassing herself.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.337
I think--

16:43.420 --> 16:44.755
I think we can do better.

16:45.255 --> 16:48.050
I don't know. You gotta prove that.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.926
This looks so much better.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.611
He thinks I didn't see that?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.321
Hey.

17:52.865 --> 17:56.201
Danny, Sheila, I want you to meet
some great pals of mine.

17:57.828 --> 17:58.912
I wonder how they fuck.

17:58.996 --> 18:01.039
That monster on top of her, pounding away.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.250
Or maybe he just lays on his back
like a manatee,

18:03.333 --> 18:05.252
and she has to climb on top
and finish him--

18:05.335 --> 18:06.712
-Honey. Yeah.
-Yeah?

18:06.795 --> 18:09.381
How many years have Jack and I
known each other? You remember?

18:09.464 --> 18:11.633
Ten, or-- I mean, since college.

18:11.717 --> 18:13.635
So-- Well, we were in college.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.888
And I was just in the dorms,
hanging around.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.057
I'm bad at math too.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.602
But I'm really good at puzzles.
I'm a visual learner.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.937
-That can't be real.
-It's a pink diamond.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.940
I had it appraised to be sure.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.818
…local representation
is the foundation of democracy.

18:30.569 --> 18:33.447
Jack, who's your local state assemblyman
up here?

18:33.530 --> 18:37.159
You really putting me on the spot
'cause we just moved up here.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.619
-But…
-Okay.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.704
I have-- I really don't have any idea.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.247
Not sure? You don't know?

18:42.331 --> 18:44.666
-No.
-Well, that's all right. You're not alone.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.878
There's a lot of progressive people,
especially here in California,

18:47.961 --> 18:50.881
that just get lazy, disengaged.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.758
That's how the conservatives
get away with it.

18:52.841 --> 18:57.262
And I'm talking redistricting,
I'm talking gutting social services.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.556
-Can you believe that?
-Let's let people maybe get a drink

18:59.640 --> 19:01.350
-before we get too political.
-That's right.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.726
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.937
-Yeah, let's get these guys some drinks.
-Come with me.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.731
All right, we're gonna talk, Brian.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.108
You know, I vote for another margarita.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.153
-Jesus.
-It's good. This is good.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.364
-There's so many people here.
-Yeah. No, it's really--

19:15.447 --> 19:17.991
-really going swell.
-It's going great.

19:30.879 --> 19:33.507
-Oh, dude.
-Hey, dude.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.800
I thought we lost you there.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.428
How long was I sleeping?

19:39.096 --> 19:40.556
I don't know.

19:40.639 --> 19:43.809
You took a full churro,
which I've never seen done.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.436
It's unprecedented, guy your size.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.480
Yeah. I guess I was hungry.

19:48.564 --> 19:51.567
Dude, never a good call with edibles.

19:51.650 --> 19:54.736
But it's all good.
And we can settle up on the board later.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.322
The board?

19:57.823 --> 20:00.492
Dude, look,
don't tell me you don't remember.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.370
I spent all night
airbrushing your tag on it.

20:03.453 --> 20:08.625
It's an extra three hundo,
but it looks so damn sweet.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.219
-Hey.
-Try one. They're divine.

20:19.303 --> 20:21.889
Oh, no. Vegetarian, I can't.
I think it might be time for the ask.

20:21.972 --> 20:23.765
No. They're potato and cheese, no meat.

20:23.849 --> 20:25.767
-You need to have one.
-No, I'm good. I don't want to.

20:25.851 --> 20:29.354
But I feel like there's enough guests
here now, so it's a good time.

20:29.438 --> 20:31.106
And if you don't wanna introduce Danny,

20:31.190 --> 20:33.650
-I could do it.
-Look, Sheila.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.402
-Just do it here in this circle.
-Sheila.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.531
Listen, I am so sorry if I gave you
the wrong idea.

20:39.615 --> 20:44.203
But passing the hat around just,
I mean, it seems like kind of a drag.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.287
Well…

20:46.580 --> 20:51.210
But I was very clear on the phone
that we needed to raise funds.

20:51.293 --> 20:54.463
Yeah, and I said I'd be happy
to introduce you to people.

20:54.546 --> 20:58.383
But putting people on the spot,
I mean, that's not really our scene.

20:58.467 --> 21:01.053
You absolute moron.
She was never gonna help you.

21:01.136 --> 21:02.846
She just wanted to rub your face in it.

21:02.930 --> 21:05.140
The power of personal narrative

21:05.224 --> 21:10.687
really boils down to taking charge
of the most important story we tell:

21:11.188 --> 21:13.982
the story of our own lives.

21:14.066 --> 21:18.320
Politics, industry, diplomacy, right?

21:18.403 --> 21:22.366
It's not what we do,
it's the story that we tell about it.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.993
Now, to put it another way, it's--

21:25.077 --> 21:26.578
Lying. It's lying.

21:27.162 --> 21:30.499
You're telling people
that facts don't matter.

21:30.582 --> 21:31.583
No, I'm sorry.

21:31.667 --> 21:36.004
Actually, you are selling people
that facts don't matter.

21:36.088 --> 21:39.091
You'll have to forgive my friend Danny,
he gets upset

21:39.174 --> 21:41.093
when no one's paying attention to him.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.761
Belinda. Belinda.

21:42.845 --> 21:45.806
-I have a surprise for you.
-How do you know Belinda Westbrook?

21:45.889 --> 21:48.016
We're in the same water fitness class.
She says anything.

21:48.100 --> 21:52.354
-Hi! Yes.
-Sheila Dale Norton!

21:52.437 --> 21:53.981
-Rubin now.
-Right. Rubin.

21:54.064 --> 21:56.275
-Yeah.
-Sorry. I forgot.

21:56.358 --> 21:59.945
You married that Jewish hippie
to piss off your parents.

22:00.779 --> 22:02.447
-She says anything.
-Oh, God.

22:02.531 --> 22:07.077
That wasn't-- I didn't really--
I didn't do that. I didn't do that.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.205
You are still the skinniest in the room,
like always.

22:10.289 --> 22:11.415
You know, Tanya,

22:11.498 --> 22:16.003
I am the one who taught her
how to throw up before ballet class.

22:16.086 --> 22:17.546
We all used to do it back then.

22:17.629 --> 22:20.007
-No, that's terrible.
-It's terrible.

22:20.090 --> 22:21.091
-Wow.
-Oh, God.

22:21.175 --> 22:23.552
It took me many years
to get over that nonsense.

22:24.928 --> 22:30.017
Luckily for me,
I met the most amazing psychologist…

22:30.100 --> 22:31.894
Dr. Salvator Amani,

22:32.519 --> 22:35.981
and he cracked me open.

22:39.526 --> 22:43.197
You are worse than Reagan. Truly, you are.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.866
I mean, he would have us believe
that he fought in wars

22:45.949 --> 22:48.327
instead of acting in movies about them.

22:48.410 --> 22:51.330
My book is not at all political.

22:51.413 --> 22:54.541
Everything is political. Everything.

22:54.625 --> 22:59.338
It was political when Reagan called in
the national guard to fire weapons

22:59.421 --> 23:01.089
at American students.

23:01.757 --> 23:06.220
Citizens who were peacefully protesting
the war of aggression in Vietnam.

23:06.303 --> 23:08.972
Here we go. Here we go with the Vietnam.

23:09.056 --> 23:12.643
You don't still do it, do you?
Sneak off and barf?

23:13.143 --> 23:15.562
What? Oh, my God. Of course not.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.898
That's teenage stuff.

23:18.524 --> 23:20.943
And I'm not a teenager,
obviously. Anymore.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.945
No, you're old and still sick.

23:23.028 --> 23:24.154
You're worse.

23:24.238 --> 23:28.534
You know, Dr. Amani helped me see
that it was never really about food.

23:29.493 --> 23:30.494
It's about control.

23:30.577 --> 23:31.578
Control.

23:31.662 --> 23:34.414
It's a fact. I was there and so were you.

23:34.498 --> 23:37.125
Till you took off, and ran for the hills

23:37.751 --> 23:40.671
while the rest of us were getting beaten
and arrested.

23:41.338 --> 23:44.842
And yet you begged us to invite you
into our home.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.802
My wife begged you.

23:47.886 --> 23:50.681
That's your narrative, not mine.

23:52.516 --> 23:54.768
Which is sort of exactly
what I'm talking about

23:54.852 --> 23:57.729
if you think about it
because this is Danny's story.

23:57.813 --> 24:01.692
I've actually really gotten into fitness.
Aerobics. I'm teaching it.

24:01.775 --> 24:06.321
And it's, I mean, it's so addictive.
In a good way.

24:06.405 --> 24:08.991
But, it's-- You're teaching?

24:09.074 --> 24:12.077
Like, what, just… as, like, a hobby?

24:12.160 --> 24:14.830
Or like, just, you know,
something to keep busy?

24:15.664 --> 24:19.001
No, a job. Yeah, a business.
I met this talented--

24:19.084 --> 24:20.544
Why didn't I know about this?

24:20.627 --> 24:23.547
I don't know, maybe because
you never shut the fuck up about yourself.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.008
You were always the best at ballet.

24:26.091 --> 24:30.429
And then you quit,
and none of us knew why.

24:31.471 --> 24:32.973
We had our theories though.

24:33.056 --> 24:35.684
Yeah, I can't really remember.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.769
And it's none of your
fucking business, cow.

24:37.853 --> 24:40.063
Gosh. I… You know what?

24:40.147 --> 24:43.108
-Let me check on Maya.
-Oh, no, she's good.

24:43.192 --> 24:44.860
Our girl's with her, they're watching…

24:44.943 --> 24:47.571
-…a Disney video on the big screen.
-Oh, good. Okay.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.744
Oh, gosh. Sorry. I'm sorry.

25:30.822 --> 25:34.409
You dumb bitch. Stop! Stop right now!

25:35.911 --> 25:36.912
Stop!

25:37.663 --> 25:40.415
Stop! Stop! Stop!

25:43.210 --> 25:46.672
You don't need this.
You don't need this anymore.

26:06.817 --> 26:08.485
You can fucking do this.

26:09.069 --> 26:10.362
You know you can.

26:12.781 --> 26:13.991
You can do this.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.523
You can fucking do this. You know you can.

26:47.566 --> 26:48.775
You can do this.

27:16.053 --> 27:17.054
Hi, Mom.
