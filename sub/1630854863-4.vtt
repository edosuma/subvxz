WEBVTT

00:11.502 --> 00:13.732
I'd like you to
supply me with product.

00:13.860 --> 00:14.711
Heroin?

00:14.801 --> 00:17.476
- Cocaine.
- Whoever hear of pot dealer needing shop?

00:17.583 --> 00:18.882
Maybe he's branching out.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.292
I've got a game changer
coming up.

00:21.292 --> 00:23.087
I want twice as much
as Terry got.

00:26.764 --> 00:28.841
There's this cocaine
vending machine

00:28.841 --> 00:30.303
in the middle of
Kings Cross.

00:30.303 --> 00:31.991
You've asked me
to your house,

00:31.991 --> 00:33.766
and then you stab me
in the heart.

00:37.028 --> 00:38.465
You're fucking dead!

00:38.465 --> 00:41.324
If you're looking for a
pad to match this place,

00:42.790 --> 00:43.737
you give me a call.

00:44.184 --> 00:46.887
You say the sale price
is 2.3 mil.

00:47.991 --> 00:49.666
I want to take over
his club.

00:50.379 --> 00:51.706
Fat fuck George,
he's all yours.

00:51.706 --> 00:53.092
Your lease
has been terminated.

00:53.525 --> 00:54.945
Steph is the
new lease holder.

00:55.211 --> 00:56.473
Me and Sam are her partners.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.901
Hey Molly, Molly,
you are burning them.

00:58.901 --> 01:00.876
The key is to get in quick.

01:01.411 --> 01:02.531
What happened?

01:03.762 --> 01:04.789
Get in.

01:05.327 --> 01:06.620
No, mate, this is crazy.

01:06.620 --> 01:07.667
Dude, okay, okay.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.485
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.060
Mate, hey.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.124
In a hurry?

01:20.217 --> 01:23.274
Never, just work.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.332
Are you feeling okay?

01:26.424 --> 01:28.215
Yeah, I feel fine.

01:28.660 --> 01:30.208
Just a little indigestion.

01:30.443 --> 01:31.807
- Don't worry.
- Mm.

01:37.179 --> 01:38.752
Hmm.

02:53.312 --> 02:54.756
The cash flow
from the new club

02:54.756 --> 02:56.300
is going to pay
off the house,

02:56.300 --> 02:57.940
and then when I get over
the initial hump,

02:57.940 --> 03:00.057
I can think about
buying another house.

03:00.057 --> 03:02.225
It'll be a little
Ibrahim empire.

03:03.085 --> 03:08.196
- Just think about it.
- You know, you can
stay whenever you like.

03:08.830 --> 03:10.218
Close to your uni.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.331
No more dodging your
parents all the time.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.746
You just call 'em and you say,

03:15.746 --> 03:18.509
"Hey, listen,
going to my friend's place."

03:18.983 --> 03:20.510
You come here and we can...

03:23.469 --> 03:24.758
Hang.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.543
I don't fit in
with all of this.

03:32.023 --> 03:33.207
Oh, you think I do?

03:33.784 --> 03:36.061
I've never been to a house
with more than one toilet.

03:42.498 --> 03:44.126
Is this about your boss?

03:52.077 --> 03:53.389
If I don't stop him,

03:54.263 --> 03:56.580
he's going to do what he
did to you to another girl.

03:56.790 --> 04:01.931
The only way to stop a bully
is to bully them yourself.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.084
- It's not that.
- What is it then?

04:05.084 --> 04:07.366
God, I've thought about
stuffing that dickhead

04:07.366 --> 04:09.516
in the boot and doing
donuts, heaps of times.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.635
Good.

04:16.093 --> 04:17.538
Molly, what's going on?

04:23.683 --> 04:26.360
You'll never be
satisfied with just me.

04:29.476 --> 04:30.983
What are you talking about?

04:33.347 --> 04:34.547
Look at you.

04:36.052 --> 04:38.419
You're already talking
about the new club

04:39.382 --> 04:43.022
and the new car
and the new girl.

04:44.661 --> 04:46.394
I'm only going to
get in the way.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.028
Molly.

04:50.270 --> 04:51.560
You don't know that.

04:54.013 --> 04:55.169
But you do.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.620
That's my taxi.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.749
I asked him to wait.

05:49.007 --> 05:50.941
Hey, hold up, Constable.

05:50.941 --> 05:52.287
Cafe's closed.

05:52.683 --> 05:54.584
Fuck off,
you fucking muppet.

05:54.942 --> 05:56.194
It's Mullet.

05:57.797 --> 05:58.732
Get what?

05:59.177 --> 06:00.610
Hey mate,
this a private meeting.

06:00.753 --> 06:03.393
Just getting a couple of
coffees for the boss, carry on.

06:18.424 --> 06:19.600
Hold up.

06:21.123 --> 06:22.392
Who are you?

06:22.643 --> 06:24.906
Mullet, I got to pat you down.

06:25.623 --> 06:26.976
You know who you're talking to?

06:26.976 --> 06:27.991
Yeah, I'm talking to you, mate.

06:27.991 --> 06:29.616
Joey said, all right,
so just...

06:29.616 --> 06:30.673
Get your hands
off him.

06:30.673 --> 06:32.525
Hey relax,
kid's doing his job.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.954
Oh, you want to see
me do mine, Joey?

06:33.954 --> 06:36.640
- Yeah, go. Have a go, have a crack.
- Mullet, relax!

06:37.551 --> 06:39.006
Come on,
let's go inside.

06:51.810 --> 06:53.494
What the fuck he doing here?

06:53.598 --> 06:54.679
He's good.

06:55.283 --> 06:56.114
Take a seat.

06:57.519 --> 06:58.869
You want coffee?

07:00.790 --> 07:02.635
No, I don't want
a fucking coffee.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.135
Okay, who wants to start?

07:11.071 --> 07:12.352
What do you think
you're doing?

07:13.792 --> 07:16.978
Making a living,
just like you, Nasa.

07:17.349 --> 07:20.086
No, not like me.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.380
I call the shots around here.

07:22.380 --> 07:24.766
You, you're just a drug dealer.

07:24.766 --> 07:26.803
Yeah, well, maybe I
don't need you anymore.

07:28.755 --> 07:30.397
Maybe I'll talk to Ezra direct.

07:30.397 --> 07:31.642
He'll spit on you.

07:31.963 --> 07:35.373
Hey, you okay with this
drugs on the street bullshit?

07:35.373 --> 07:37.922
For fucks sake, we're getting
the drugs off the street!

07:38.290 --> 07:39.525
Wake the fuck up.

07:40.086 --> 07:41.847
All right,
coke's the new game.

07:41.847 --> 07:44.093
I know it, Ezra knows it,
you fucking know it too.

07:44.093 --> 07:45.251
You're just too fucking stupid.

07:47.270 --> 07:49.330
Nasa, put the fucking gun away.

07:50.336 --> 07:53.693
Fuck! Nasa.
Nasa, just put...

07:53.786 --> 07:54.499
Nasa!

07:54.499 --> 07:55.916
What the fuck
you say to me, huh?

07:57.310 --> 08:01.135
I'll teach you some respect,
you fucking drug peddling scum.

08:01.237 --> 08:02.296
Hmm?

08:02.667 --> 08:03.941
Last chance, Nasa.

08:03.941 --> 08:06.033
Put the fucking
gun away, mate.

08:06.593 --> 08:07.775
Put it away.

08:11.996 --> 08:14.266
Police, drop the weapon.
Drop it!

08:14.266 --> 08:16.097
Put the gun down,
do it now.

08:16.097 --> 08:18.688
- I'll shoot.
- Oy, you're not shooting anyone.

08:18.688 --> 08:19.891
Same team.

08:19.891 --> 08:21.131
Hold your fire.

08:21.698 --> 08:24.603
Nasa, hand the gun over,
nice and easy.

08:40.209 --> 08:42.059
Out you go,
out you go.

08:42.059 --> 08:43.809
Hey!

08:45.023 --> 08:46.219
Shit.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.241
That's the thing.

08:54.241 --> 08:55.767
You're not listening
to me, Nasa.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.507
This is fucking
bullshit. Stop him.

08:57.507 --> 08:58.927
No, I do nothing.

08:58.927 --> 09:01.238
Well, who's the
fucking idiot who pulled out a piece?

09:01.238 --> 09:03.350
You can't do that
shit in broad daylight, brother.

09:03.350 --> 09:06.278
Okay? I should be fucking
arresting you.

09:06.278 --> 09:08.142
But I'm only
confiscating your weapon

09:08.142 --> 09:09.744
and sending you home
with these boys.

09:09.744 --> 09:11.365
No, my driver,
he take me home.

09:11.365 --> 09:13.394
I need you out of here so
I can sort this shit out.

09:13.394 --> 09:14.856
Get in the fucking car.

09:16.458 --> 09:17.655
Who the fuck are you?

09:17.655 --> 09:19.619
Detective Doyle, AFP.

09:19.619 --> 09:21.301
Of course you're
a fucking Fed.

09:21.301 --> 09:22.922
You could've started
a shootout there.

09:22.922 --> 09:24.156
What, you think I had a choice?

09:24.156 --> 09:26.150
I walk passed and
see a guy waving a gun.

09:26.864 --> 09:28.203
What do you expect me to do?

09:28.203 --> 09:29.674
Read the fucking room.

09:29.774 --> 09:31.564
We're in a month's
long operation,

09:31.564 --> 09:34.670
and you have just
royally fucked us.

09:34.670 --> 09:37.427
Look, I'm sorry, but I don't know what else
I could have done.

09:40.158 --> 09:41.241
Okay.

09:42.292 --> 09:44.254
All right, I'll let you
get back to it.

09:44.254 --> 09:45.651
That's a good idea.

09:46.290 --> 09:48.059
Guess I owe you
a few cold ones.

09:48.290 --> 09:49.732
Yeah, we'll hold you to that.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.143
Fuckable.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.916
But with a step ladder though.

10:13.214 --> 10:14.900
I can make more in
a week with this stuff

10:14.900 --> 10:16.665
than I can in a year
with this stuff.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.420
Fucking genius invention.

10:20.842 --> 10:23.055
Dealer gets sprung,
they just swallow the lot.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.494
Why am I here, Joey?

10:25.494 --> 10:27.148
Fuck.

10:28.557 --> 10:30.390
Everyone wants in on this, Sammy.

10:31.410 --> 10:34.025
Amateurs, cowboys,
fucking Viets.

10:35.754 --> 10:37.542
I need you to keep 'em out.

10:38.661 --> 10:39.636
Oh really?

10:39.636 --> 10:41.933
- Yeah, really.
- I already got a job.

10:42.603 --> 10:43.686
Fuck.

10:44.765 --> 10:47.374
I can pay fucking 10 times
more than Nasa.

10:48.095 --> 10:49.179
Hmm?

10:50.235 --> 10:53.910
And as much of this
shit as you can hammer.

10:55.745 --> 10:57.156
Go on, it's not going to bite.

11:01.568 --> 11:02.829
I don't do any
of this shit.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.253
Fuck.

11:04.890 --> 11:07.955
Okay, well,
how about cash then?

11:09.662 --> 11:10.945
What do you reckon?

11:17.290 --> 11:18.614
I reckon you need help.

11:27.762 --> 11:30.186
Hey, what the fuck's
wrong with you?

11:30.291 --> 11:31.428
Sammy!

11:56.369 --> 11:58.715
Excuse me, may I join you?

11:59.374 --> 12:00.773
You remember me?

12:01.096 --> 12:02.514
May I sit?

12:02.970 --> 12:04.252
Thank you.

12:08.919 --> 12:11.926
I was just walking past,
and I saw you sitting here,

12:11.926 --> 12:16.039
and I'm here to
offer you a proposition.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.763
Go on then.

12:20.029 --> 12:21.353
Joey Romano.

12:22.016 --> 12:23.133
His cocaine.

12:23.399 --> 12:24.892
I have guaranteed supply

12:24.892 --> 12:27.553
far better than anything
that he could provide.

12:28.113 --> 12:29.979
And you have the
venues to distribute.

12:30.527 --> 12:32.628
Your lot is not welcome here.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.786
We don't mix.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.098
Change is coming,
Mr. Shipman.

12:42.883 --> 12:44.075
We'll see.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.281
You know what, this is over.

12:47.374 --> 12:48.776
Fuck off.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.391
If you change your mind.

13:03.576 --> 13:05.024
She's got some front,
hasn't she?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.505
PK!

13:19.290 --> 13:20.449
Spare a twenty?

13:20.449 --> 13:22.685
Jesus, Jools,
get over here.

13:23.843 --> 13:25.825
What's going on with you, huh?

13:26.778 --> 13:28.782
You got to straighten
yourself out, all right?

13:28.782 --> 13:31.499
Yeah, I am, I am, I am, I am. Please.

13:32.703 --> 13:34.565
Jesus, fuck.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.017
Here, get yourself a feed,
all right?

13:37.017 --> 13:39.201
- Thank you.
- Before you blow away.

13:39.201 --> 13:40.625
Thank you so much.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.266
Where the fuck
is she going?

13:48.266 --> 13:50.442
- Hey.
- Hey, I want to see the man.

13:50.442 --> 13:52.519
- Fuck off, Jools.
- Oh, don't be a prick.

13:52.519 --> 13:54.936
I told you.
No pay, no play.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.209
Unfucking believable.

13:59.315 --> 14:01.976
Hey, big spender.
Go on, get in there.

14:01.976 --> 14:04.136
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Club's closed, boys.

14:04.136 --> 14:05.767
- We just want to go in.
- Go on, piss off, Bigfoot.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.018
- Come on.
- Piss off!

14:07.018 --> 14:08.267
What's with you, mate?

14:12.655 --> 14:13.753
Hey.

14:13.970 --> 14:16.119
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

14:18.210 --> 14:19.551
Thanks, lovely.

14:26.023 --> 14:27.292
Fucker!

14:27.502 --> 14:28.444
Move!

14:33.416 --> 14:35.071
Oi, oi!

14:36.658 --> 14:38.014
Oi!

14:38.014 --> 14:41.185
Come here, get in here!
Use your fucking legs!

14:59.661 --> 15:00.728
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

15:18.869 --> 15:20.575
Got it, let's go!

15:30.168 --> 15:32.863
Ah, fuck yes, fuck!

15:32.863 --> 15:35.126
- What the fuck Joey?
- Fuck!

15:35.126 --> 15:36.466
What! What?

15:37.345 --> 15:38.946
Fuck!

15:39.083 --> 15:40.726
What the fuck did they get?

15:41.196 --> 15:44.277
- What the fuck did they get?
- They took everything!

15:44.374 --> 15:45.672
Fuck!

15:45.983 --> 15:48.167
- Mullet!
- Joey!

15:49.404 --> 15:50.358
Who the fuck was it?

15:50.358 --> 15:52.872
I don't know.
They had fucking balaclavas on.

15:52.872 --> 15:54.199
Fuck!

15:54.199 --> 15:56.265
- Fucking hell!
- Joey, I'm fucking sorry.

15:56.265 --> 15:58.535
- Fuck!
- Fuck.

16:23.919 --> 16:25.765
They don't know who
the fuck we are!

16:43.008 --> 16:44.463
Hey, spender!

16:54.209 --> 16:57.242
So 1967,
I was a 10 pound Pom.

16:57.242 --> 16:58.737
You know 10 pound Pom?

16:58.737 --> 17:02.118
All right,
so ass out of my pants,

17:02.118 --> 17:04.855
and nothing in my pockets, right?

17:04.855 --> 17:08.709
And here you are, you see that
building down there

17:08.709 --> 17:09.878
on the corner, the brick one?

17:10.921 --> 17:11.900
It's mine now.

17:12.875 --> 17:17.530
And then that one,
the one next to it.

17:17.530 --> 17:18.642
You see that one?

17:18.642 --> 17:20.087
That's mine and all.

17:20.667 --> 17:23.252
And then further down
the street, right?

17:23.252 --> 17:24.893
- And...
- Yours?

17:24.893 --> 17:27.617
Yeah, yeah, it's all mine.

17:28.444 --> 17:32.181
The real estate thing is,
you know,

17:32.181 --> 17:36.682
it's up and down, man,
but it's really fucking fun.

17:36.682 --> 17:38.294
- You called me?
- Yeah.

17:39.056 --> 17:40.236
Yeah.

17:40.236 --> 17:42.392
Someone took a shot at...

17:42.803 --> 17:44.135
- Lasers.
- Lasers, yeah.

17:44.135 --> 17:45.517
- I heard.
- Yeah, was it you?

17:46.037 --> 17:48.807
They were wearing balaclavas.
I wouldn't ruin my hair.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.815
So, is Nasa...?

17:53.065 --> 17:54.445
- No.
- No?

17:54.445 --> 17:56.623
You saw him slam
a gun in Romano's face.

17:56.623 --> 17:59.146
It wasn't Nasa. He would've
asked me and Sam. He didn't.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.339
I don't know why we don't
shut this place down.

18:01.339 --> 18:02.980
Put Joey back in his place.

18:04.007 --> 18:05.951
A man's got a right to
earn a living, don't he?

18:05.951 --> 18:07.615
Yes, he does,
but he's creating chaos.

18:07.615 --> 18:09.401
We should be backing Nasa
because it's business

18:09.401 --> 18:10.329
we actually understand.

18:10.329 --> 18:13.208
John, cocaine's here
whether you like it or not.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.732
It's not fucking going anywhere.

18:17.827 --> 18:21.744
Maybe it's time for Nasa
to step down, right?

18:23.395 --> 18:24.684
He's not going to retire.

18:24.684 --> 18:26.642
It would look like
he was pushed.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.022
Well, and he'd be right,
wouldn't he?

18:29.935 --> 18:32.865
No, okay, you and Sam,
you step up as shot callers,

18:32.865 --> 18:35.726
and Nasa, he gets
to put his feet up.

18:35.726 --> 18:37.613
Talk to him, Johnny.
He trusts you.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.318
That's not going to happen.

18:42.976 --> 18:44.389
Do you want this?

18:46.263 --> 18:50.127
You really, you really
want all of this?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.362
'Cause it can hurt.

18:53.365 --> 18:56.534
John, it can really
fucking hurt.

19:03.099 --> 19:04.300
John.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.680
Go home.

19:07.381 --> 19:09.048
Think about what Ezra said.

19:09.666 --> 19:11.252
Think really fucking hard.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.517
It's never going
to happen, Johnny.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.575
That's what I told him, but
Nasa might not have a choice.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.727
You do some push-ups.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.512
You understand that he brought
us into this game, yeah?

19:48.045 --> 19:49.019
I know that.

19:49.019 --> 19:50.266
He's like family, John.

19:50.733 --> 19:53.504
Yeah, if we don't give him
a nudge, someone else might.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.410
At least this way
we can look after him.

19:56.036 --> 19:58.350
Joey Romano wants to
get rid of him as well.

19:58.547 --> 19:59.970
You know he offered me a gig?

20:04.713 --> 20:05.947
What, you too?

20:07.664 --> 20:09.664
- Did you say yes?
- No.

20:10.413 --> 20:11.830
- Did you?
- No.

20:13.308 --> 20:14.635
- Good.
- Good.

20:17.094 --> 20:18.896
All right, show me this combo, dickhead.

20:28.335 --> 20:29.395
Not bad.

20:29.522 --> 20:30.441
What do you mean not bad?

20:30.441 --> 20:31.661
Technique's fucked.

20:33.960 --> 20:38.028
Okay. I don't trust any of these
pieces of shit, especially Ezra.

20:38.886 --> 20:40.380
Yeah, well, the weird
old fuck, I never know

20:40.380 --> 20:42.149
whether he's threatening
me or coming onto me.

20:42.782 --> 20:44.185
You think everyone's
coming onto you.

20:44.185 --> 20:46.417
It's just this charisma
and charm of mine, man.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.465
- Oh no, John.
- No seriously, it's a curse.

20:47.465 --> 20:48.073
John, please don't
start this shit.

20:48.073 --> 20:50.064
They're out there floating around.
It's affecting everybody.

20:50.064 --> 20:51.414
- Someone might get hurt, Sam.
- Stop!

20:51.414 --> 20:52.635
No, I'm serious...

20:57.045 --> 20:58.559
- That was good, huh?
- Uh huh.

20:59.033 --> 21:01.012
You liked that?
You want another one?

21:01.012 --> 21:01.678
No, I don't
want another...

21:01.678 --> 21:02.602
If you want
another one, keep talking.

21:02.602 --> 21:03.465
No, it was a good one.

21:03.465 --> 21:04.751
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.008
You know who I'd love
to fucking slap?

21:10.666 --> 21:11.707
Your mate, Ezra.

21:11.707 --> 21:12.951
He's not my fucking mate.

21:14.364 --> 21:17.890
Listen, we don't get
into bed with anybody.

21:18.814 --> 21:21.291
We should play this out
and we see what happens.

21:22.418 --> 21:24.043
We need to get ourselves
into a position

21:24.043 --> 21:27.545
where we don't need anyone,
and that's why I buy stuff.

21:29.335 --> 21:31.875
Yeah, what, like this million
dollar house you can't afford.

21:33.451 --> 21:35.631
- Don't show Dad.
- He's going to think
you're a wanker, John.

21:36.603 --> 21:38.050
Don't worry,
I'm not planning on it.

21:39.384 --> 21:40.781
Any way, it's not about him.

21:41.696 --> 21:42.947
Yeah, I know.

21:43.821 --> 21:45.004
It's about that.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.190
Listen, whatever you decide,
I'll...

21:54.414 --> 21:56.445
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Sam.

21:56.445 --> 21:58.226
Hey, good to see you brother.

21:58.226 --> 21:59.642
Good to see ya.

22:00.095 --> 22:02.403
I'm Sam, pleasure to meet you.

22:02.403 --> 22:04.240
Oh good, another fucking Sam.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.573
I'm Tongan Sam.

22:06.337 --> 22:09.614
Listen John,
I can't be everywhere.

22:09.614 --> 22:11.096
I can't keep up
with all the shit

22:11.096 --> 22:12.434
they're just stirring
around town.

22:12.434 --> 22:13.640
You need a minder.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.270
- I don't need a fucking minder.
- You almost got shot

22:16.270 --> 22:17.307
getting a coffee the other day.

22:17.307 --> 22:19.143
- That was bad luck.
- Bad luck?

22:19.320 --> 22:21.108
You need 10 people
looking after you.

22:22.068 --> 22:23.981
Sam's the closest
to that as I can get.

22:24.768 --> 22:26.100
It's true.

22:29.219 --> 22:32.228
Now, if I see you guys
in the Cross

22:32.228 --> 22:34.065
more than 10 feet away
from each other,

22:34.786 --> 22:36.191
I'll shoot the both of youse.

22:37.238 --> 22:38.448
- Okay.
- Good?

22:38.448 --> 22:39.613
Good.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.243
Thank you, Arianna.

22:54.092 --> 22:55.705
You want to give
me heart attack?

22:55.791 --> 22:56.947
No, it's good for you.

22:58.991 --> 23:00.453
Why are you here, Johnny?

23:02.710 --> 23:03.919
What do you want?

23:07.768 --> 23:11.125
This thing, does it
really keep you safe?

23:12.622 --> 23:14.985
Stop bullshitting, hmm?

23:17.492 --> 23:18.836
I want to say
something to you.

23:18.836 --> 23:20.096
Yeah?! Say it.

23:22.797 --> 23:24.237
I think you should
speak to Ezra.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.276
Clear the bad blood
between you and Joey.

23:26.949 --> 23:28.642
Fuck you. You don't
tell me what to do, okay?

23:28.642 --> 23:31.173
- Before things get out of hand.
- Out of hand how?

23:32.261 --> 23:34.893
Before someone gets killed, Nasa.

23:35.267 --> 23:37.017
So this is what
it's about, huh?

23:37.430 --> 23:38.852
They want to get rid of me.

23:39.439 --> 23:40.925
They think I passed it.

23:43.268 --> 23:44.422
How about you, Johnny?

23:45.008 --> 23:46.577
You want to get rid of me too?

23:46.897 --> 23:50.291
You know we're solid,
me and Sam.

23:51.058 --> 23:52.893
You know that,
that's why I am here.

23:52.893 --> 23:54.994
Yeah, we're solid?

23:56.007 --> 23:57.266
Well, fuck you.

23:57.423 --> 23:59.393
And fuck sucking Ezra's dick.

24:01.036 --> 24:02.101
Just think about it.

24:02.101 --> 24:03.576
Get out of my house.

24:27.392 --> 24:28.740
You all right?

24:29.479 --> 24:30.706
No, I'm good.

24:30.917 --> 24:32.563
Stubborn prick won't listen.

24:33.727 --> 24:35.309
You can only do so much, Johnny.

24:35.631 --> 24:36.926
What the fuck does that mean?

24:37.750 --> 24:39.230
Nothing.

24:51.804 --> 24:54.719
And we eat it, too.
Evening, Nasa.

24:58.962 --> 25:00.484
All right.

25:10.323 --> 25:12.234
You have something
you want to say to me?

25:17.917 --> 25:19.045
You want to do this here?

25:19.644 --> 25:20.880
Here, now.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.501
Okay, go on then, okay.

25:26.872 --> 25:29.571
I build a world, make everybody
here a lot of money...

25:30.763 --> 25:32.259
...but no drugs.

25:34.042 --> 25:35.684
We agreed, this was our honour.

25:36.302 --> 25:39.813
And now you want to fuck me
over for this shit, Joey Romano?

25:41.458 --> 25:42.618
We have system.

25:43.136 --> 25:44.362
It works.

25:44.826 --> 25:46.892
I'm the system.

25:50.408 --> 25:51.728
Just...

25:55.458 --> 25:56.811
Just go away.

26:00.397 --> 26:01.676
All right, call it.

26:24.491 --> 26:25.825
Mate, how are ya?

26:26.103 --> 26:27.455
All right.

26:28.209 --> 26:30.708
So the boss pointed John
Ibrahim in Nasa's direction.

26:30.708 --> 26:33.693
Now either the kid didn't
fucking understand the message,

26:34.260 --> 26:36.226
or Nasa chose to ignore it.

26:36.737 --> 26:39.851
So now it needs to be done in
a way that can't be ignored.

26:39.851 --> 26:40.763
Yeah.

26:40.763 --> 26:42.222
With the kid present.

26:42.707 --> 26:44.265
All right, no worries.

26:44.613 --> 26:45.692
- Yep.
- - All right.
- Thanks

26:45.692 --> 26:47.054
- I'll see you soon.
- See you mate.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.513
Fuck, here comes Charlene.

27:06.513 --> 27:08.270
You think I should
fucking talk to her?

27:09.196 --> 27:11.593
All you'd ever get
is the friend zone, mate.

27:11.593 --> 27:12.453
- At best.
- What the fuck do

27:12.453 --> 27:13.955
they keep in those cases?

27:14.042 --> 27:16.710
Dildos, frangers, cut lunch?

27:17.936 --> 27:20.266
Jesus, check out the one with
the fucking hoop earrings.

27:20.266 --> 27:21.910
She's beautiful.

27:23.374 --> 27:24.772
Yeah, he's the sort.

27:25.192 --> 27:26.238
What?

27:26.238 --> 27:27.986
For fuck's sake,
it's a bloke.

27:28.386 --> 27:30.895
Jesus Christ, you can't
tell these days, man.

27:30.895 --> 27:31.995
Fucking hell.

27:36.553 --> 27:37.654
Here.

27:38.181 --> 27:40.472
Oh, hang on, here they are.

27:41.403 --> 27:42.685
Showtime.

27:43.958 --> 27:45.628
Give him a second to go in.

27:50.273 --> 27:51.957
Come on, come on.

28:06.458 --> 28:08.264
- You're late.
- Am I?

28:08.264 --> 28:09.736
Speak to Ezra yet?

28:10.490 --> 28:12.031
Fuck Ezra, okay.

28:12.138 --> 28:14.457
- Is all the money here?
- Yeah, all the money's there.

28:15.343 --> 28:16.927
What are you guys doing here?

28:16.927 --> 28:20.771
- Crellan.
- Nasa Kalouri, we believe

28:20.771 --> 28:23.648
you're in possession of a prohibited drug
listed under Schedule 1

28:23.648 --> 28:25.412
of the Drug Misuse
and Trafficking Act.

28:25.412 --> 28:26.266
Take a stand.

28:26.266 --> 28:27.378
- That's fucking bullshit.
- Get out of my office, huh?

28:27.378 --> 28:28.524
Get out from behind the desk.

28:28.524 --> 28:29.544
- Stand up.
- Where are your warrant?

28:29.544 --> 28:32.874
I don't need a warrant if I believe you
have a firearm or drugs on your person.

28:32.874 --> 28:35.175
You fucking dog.
I know who send you, huh?

28:35.175 --> 28:36.843
You do this to me now,
Crellan, huh?

28:36.843 --> 28:38.703
Look what we got here?

28:38.703 --> 28:40.876
- You just fucking planted that.
- You are done.

28:40.876 --> 28:43.298
- Let go of me.
- You stay still, stay still.

28:43.298 --> 28:44.713
You do this to me now, Crellan?

28:44.713 --> 28:46.681
This is not a good idea
doing this to him.

28:48.082 --> 28:49.669
- Let's go!
- Are you seriously going to do

28:49.669 --> 28:52.662
that to him, of all people?
Let go of me, you fucking dogs!

28:52.662 --> 28:54.936
Crellan, you'll
fucking regret this.

28:55.878 --> 28:59.207
- Let go of me!
- Just be careful with him.

29:00.624 --> 29:02.523
Stop being so fucking
rough with him.

29:05.731 --> 29:07.950
You want to get done for
assaulting police, mate?

29:10.458 --> 29:11.638
What fucking police?

29:13.866 --> 29:14.930
Fuck, hey?

29:14.930 --> 29:17.267
Fucking smart ass, get down.

29:17.267 --> 29:21.322
Huh, yeah, want to get
done, fucking stupid?

29:21.322 --> 29:22.490
Huh?

29:22.708 --> 29:23.843
Watch your head.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.458
Get the fuck out of here.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.414
You get the fuck out
of here too.

30:06.877 --> 30:08.317
Lucky I'm fit.

30:14.535 --> 30:16.621
Why do I never see you
with a girl?

30:19.539 --> 30:21.542
I don't know, maybe
they're scared of me.

30:23.828 --> 30:25.481
Don't you like girls?

30:27.833 --> 30:29.220
It depends on the girl.

30:30.679 --> 30:31.924
I like you.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.848
You ever had sex with this?

30:48.444 --> 30:49.845
It's wild.

30:50.911 --> 30:52.418
I don't do any of that shit.

30:53.650 --> 30:55.550
Well, you've got to try it once.

31:26.523 --> 31:28.031
All right, you're free to go, mate.

31:35.978 --> 31:37.626
What the fuck was that about?

31:38.758 --> 31:40.201
Why roll Nasa?

31:44.739 --> 31:47.850
You know, for a smart fella,
you're acting pretty dumb, John.

31:52.419 --> 31:54.268
You backed the
wrong horse, mate.

32:08.416 --> 32:10.227
They are the criminals, okay?

32:10.227 --> 32:11.960
This is how crooked
the cops are.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.217
They're loading me up and they
couldn't even get that right.

32:14.217 --> 32:16.039
Wait, is this an example
of police corruption?

32:16.039 --> 32:17.501
Nasa, is that
what you're saying?

32:17.501 --> 32:18.594
Who are these policemen?

32:18.594 --> 32:19.671
No more comments.

32:19.671 --> 32:22.055
Is there corruption within the
New South Wales police force?

32:22.661 --> 32:25.107
Answer my question. Why would
they want to frame you?

32:50.440 --> 32:52.880
- Ah.
- Ah, you must be Doyle.

32:53.290 --> 32:55.025
- Doug Kemp.
- Inspector.

32:55.025 --> 32:56.794
Nice to have a girl on the team.

32:57.791 --> 33:00.224
Welcome to Taskforce HQ.

33:00.737 --> 33:03.614
Early days, but we'll
be up and running soon.

33:03.614 --> 33:05.999
- Great.
- Legals and accounts
are over there.

33:05.999 --> 33:08.659
We've got the investigators
down here on the shop floor,

33:08.659 --> 33:11.229
and tech heads
through that door.

33:11.930 --> 33:14.244
I kid you not, they must have
brought at least a truckload

33:14.244 --> 33:15.684
of surveillance gear with them.

33:16.075 --> 33:18.238
Still, best to keep
them as far as possible

33:18.238 --> 33:19.675
from the humans, huh?

33:21.795 --> 33:24.068
Okay, find yourself a desk.

33:25.171 --> 33:26.479
Okay.

33:26.856 --> 33:29.169
I heard a rumour you've
been out and about already,

33:29.625 --> 33:30.752
bailing up the locals?

33:30.752 --> 33:33.209
That was, that was a misunderstanding.

33:33.209 --> 33:34.780
Well, let's hope there
aren't any more.

33:35.546 --> 33:36.773
Yes, sir.

33:36.773 --> 33:38.022
Ah, here he is.

33:38.128 --> 33:40.627
I'm assuming you two
haven't met yet.

33:40.627 --> 33:41.711
- No.
- Luke O'Neill,

33:41.711 --> 33:43.418
on loan from our friends in WA.

33:43.418 --> 33:46.210
Liz Doyle, AFP, you'll be
partnering up on this one.

33:46.210 --> 33:48.287
- Doug Kemp.
- Good to meet you, sir.

33:48.680 --> 33:49.740
So this is it?

33:49.904 --> 33:52.439
Yeah, wait till the rest of
the team fly in from interstate.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.236
Right, and what's
our current status?

33:55.236 --> 33:56.853
We're still in the zombie zone.

33:57.380 --> 33:59.408
Waiting on official go
ahead, but don't worry.

33:59.408 --> 34:00.837
We won't be sitting
on our hands.

34:00.837 --> 34:02.050
We start work
right now.

34:02.050 --> 34:04.951
Oh, and if we don't get the
green light, sir?

34:05.415 --> 34:07.266
Then nothing will ever change,
will it?

34:07.497 --> 34:10.392
So how are we supposed to
function without official sanction?

34:11.179 --> 34:13.258
Well, we use our fucking
initiative Doyle.

34:13.606 --> 34:14.804
Don't we, Luke?

34:15.983 --> 34:17.190
You want to do
something useful?

34:17.190 --> 34:19.309
Familiarise yourself
with the neighbourhood.

34:19.636 --> 34:21.267
It's going to be
your second home.

34:22.126 --> 34:25.245
Oh, and ask the
detective to tell you

34:25.245 --> 34:27.298
about her morning
coffee break the other day.

34:37.057 --> 34:39.266
I can show you
around if you like.

34:39.266 --> 34:40.459
I'm staying there.

34:40.968 --> 34:42.025
In the Cross?

34:42.396 --> 34:43.709
You live in Kings Cross?

34:45.763 --> 34:47.877
Come on, let's get
some fresh air.

34:51.724 --> 34:54.203
So what's the go with
the morning coffee break?

34:54.290 --> 34:55.154
Oh god.

35:00.084 --> 35:03.650
There's a system operating
here, believe it or not.

35:07.625 --> 35:09.763
Actually, it's more than that.

35:09.763 --> 35:12.954
Now, this is going to sound
nuts, but it's an ecosystem.

35:12.954 --> 35:14.691
So everyone feeds
on everyone else,

35:14.691 --> 35:17.185
and it keeps it all
in balance somehow.

35:17.797 --> 35:19.791
Ecosystem, really?

35:20.458 --> 35:21.818
Yeah, you'll see.

35:23.825 --> 35:25.097
That's new.

35:26.064 --> 35:28.296
The Vietnamese dealer
operating here.

35:29.655 --> 35:32.003
A foreign element
in the ecosystem?

35:32.513 --> 35:33.970
Watch.

35:44.384 --> 35:45.629
Wait, did I just?

35:47.286 --> 35:48.372
Keep watching.

36:06.456 --> 36:10.284
What, that was a random
act of violence?

36:11.530 --> 36:13.633
There's nothing random
about it, Lukey.

36:21.122 --> 36:23.445
- They had half their bloody team there.
- Yeah, but you're not taking into account

36:23.445 --> 36:24.843
that it was at Lang Park.

36:24.843 --> 36:26.738
Yeah, mate, but they should
have smashed him, seriously.

36:26.738 --> 36:27.867
Come in if you're good looking.

36:27.867 --> 36:29.548
I don't think the Bunnies
are going to make it, mate.

36:29.548 --> 36:30.619
They're fucked.

36:31.552 --> 36:33.027
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:33.027 --> 36:35.072
Oh, Ms. Doyle.

36:35.290 --> 36:36.640
Plastic fantastic.

36:36.786 --> 36:38.172
Guilty as charged.

36:39.190 --> 36:40.250
Grab a seat.

36:40.930 --> 36:43.434
Friend of mine, Detective
Sergeant Luke O'Neill.

36:43.940 --> 36:46.104
Declan Mooney,
Detective Senior Constable.

36:46.104 --> 36:46.950
Good to meet you.

36:46.950 --> 36:48.812
Detective Senior
Sergeant Crellan.

36:48.812 --> 36:50.131
Another plastic?

36:50.293 --> 36:52.306
No, state copper, WA.

36:52.306 --> 36:55.121
Ah, jeez, you're a long
way from home, mate.

36:55.121 --> 36:56.287
What brings you to this
side of the country?

36:56.287 --> 36:57.947
Ah, bit of work experience.

36:57.947 --> 37:00.779
Look, I just wanted
to apologise again

37:00.779 --> 37:02.794
for my major stuff up
the other day.

37:04.777 --> 37:06.360
I appreciate it.

37:06.930 --> 37:08.017
No worries.

37:08.190 --> 37:10.458
I know what it's like to
lose all that groundwork.

37:11.389 --> 37:12.491
It happens.

37:12.893 --> 37:15.454
Well, now I have to fill
in a detailed report

37:15.454 --> 37:18.239
on the whole thing because
I drew my gun, blah, blah.

37:18.239 --> 37:19.674
It's just a pain in the ass.

37:19.674 --> 37:20.974
I might as well have shot him.

37:20.974 --> 37:22.427
You almost bloody did.

37:26.512 --> 37:27.841
Ugly looking crew
at that table.

37:27.841 --> 37:29.136
Were they club owners?

37:29.136 --> 37:30.459
Some.

37:31.031 --> 37:33.161
That fella with the gun,
is he the main man?

37:33.161 --> 37:35.396
- What's his name?
- You ask a lot of questions, don't you?

37:36.980 --> 37:39.033
Yeah, it comes
with the territory.

37:39.125 --> 37:40.646
Yeah, he is the main man.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.881
His name is Nasa Kalouri.

37:44.105 --> 37:45.178
How do I spell that?

37:45.290 --> 37:47.791
K-A-L-O-U-R-I.

37:47.791 --> 37:49.341
Is this important
to your investigation?

37:53.189 --> 37:54.815
Yeah, it could be.

37:57.028 --> 37:58.766
Did you ping him
for gun charges?

37:59.077 --> 38:00.851
No, we're looking
further up the chain.

38:04.086 --> 38:06.103
Afraid I can't say
any more than that.

38:10.268 --> 38:12.239
It's a little bit
like you not telling us

38:12.239 --> 38:13.636
what you're doing here,
isn't it?

38:17.528 --> 38:18.906
Fair enough.

38:30.857 --> 38:32.187
Thanks for dropping by.

38:32.779 --> 38:35.925
Oh, I still owe you that drink.

38:36.542 --> 38:37.836
I look forward to it.

38:51.907 --> 38:53.782
The fuck up at the Cosmopolitan.

38:53.976 --> 38:54.992
Yeah?

38:56.386 --> 38:57.874
The cop
that intervened,

38:58.634 --> 39:00.022
turns out she's a Fed.

39:00.637 --> 39:01.869
Oh yeah?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.630
She's followed up on Crellan.

39:06.027 --> 39:09.367
The question is,
what's a Fed doing

39:09.367 --> 39:10.610
sniffing around the Cross?

39:12.505 --> 39:16.311
Well, what are you asking
me for? You're a copper.

39:16.311 --> 39:19.935
I'm just a shit kicking
state copper, Ezra.

39:19.935 --> 39:23.575
The Feds don't speak to me
unless they absolutely need to.

39:23.575 --> 39:25.030
In fact, no one's
talking about it,

39:26.050 --> 39:29.785
which suggests to me we
might have a problem.

39:30.507 --> 39:32.053
What the fuck am I
paying you for?

39:32.053 --> 39:34.410
Your lot sticking guns
in each other's faces

39:34.410 --> 39:37.009
in fucking broad daylight
isn't helping much.

39:39.707 --> 39:41.219
You know, I love chickens.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.027
My mum kept chickens.

39:49.003 --> 39:50.643
- Your mother?
- Yeah.

39:52.209 --> 39:53.465
She still alive?

39:54.864 --> 39:56.806
I have no idea.

40:12.378 --> 40:13.586
All right.

40:14.318 --> 40:15.374
Take a pew.

40:19.175 --> 40:20.601
So you want to do this thing?

40:24.290 --> 40:26.450
I'm happy where things are.

40:28.708 --> 40:30.434
Oh, that's disappointing.

40:32.664 --> 40:33.923
Disappointing because
I'm not going to do

40:33.923 --> 40:35.123
your dirty work for you?

40:35.812 --> 40:36.954
Yeah.

40:40.857 --> 40:44.143
So what do you know about
these Vietnamese dealers then?

40:44.576 --> 40:46.673
They turn up sometimes,
we sort them out.

40:48.881 --> 40:50.516
Well, you might want
to sort 'em out

40:50.516 --> 40:52.069
before they get here next time.

40:54.041 --> 40:56.231
You know this
group here, Tien?

40:57.544 --> 40:58.628
Yeah.

40:59.214 --> 41:01.684
Well, find her
and tell her to stay

41:01.684 --> 41:04.405
in Cabramatta where
she fucking belongs.

41:05.766 --> 41:07.120
And take your brother with you.

41:08.317 --> 41:14.222
And could you try
a bit harder this time?

41:17.258 --> 41:18.299
Sure.

41:20.282 --> 41:21.407
Thanks.

41:25.453 --> 41:26.536
Hey.

41:28.290 --> 41:29.549
That's her number.

41:31.017 --> 41:32.213
Don't lose it.

41:42.967 --> 41:45.185
Sure this is the
right address, Johnny?

41:45.290 --> 41:46.853
Oh, that's what he said.

41:48.416 --> 41:49.837
Doesn't look right to me.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.339
Oh, I knew it, this is fucked.

41:55.719 --> 41:56.699
What?

41:56.699 --> 41:58.630
Ezra wanted me to bring Sam.

41:59.340 --> 42:00.989
You know why?

42:01.929 --> 42:04.348
Because he wants us to
take these pricks on.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.100
Obviously start a war.

42:06.438 --> 42:07.734
How come?

42:08.847 --> 42:11.063
He wants us doing Joey's
dirty work for him.

42:12.117 --> 42:13.350
Cunning old fuck.

42:13.350 --> 42:14.609
It's okay, we go inside.

42:14.609 --> 42:16.451
No, no, no, hey,
just you stay here.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.239
I don't want to start anything.

42:18.239 --> 42:19.792
And what if they do?

42:21.469 --> 42:23.355
Just stay and look out,
will ya?

42:32.125 --> 42:33.435
I don't know
what you're saying.

42:35.176 --> 42:37.922
Hey, buy me a drink first.

43:40.426 --> 43:43.261
What the fuck is this?

43:53.833 --> 43:56.999
Oh, you like to
play with guns, hey?

43:56.999 --> 43:59.816
Okay, I have one for you too.

44:01.203 --> 44:03.555
Huh?
And you?

44:04.352 --> 44:07.272
And what about you, pretty
girl, you want one, huh?

44:07.943 --> 44:09.187
Good.

44:11.902 --> 44:14.236
I will help you
with that today.

44:15.890 --> 44:18.411
That's cool,
I have one too.

44:19.697 --> 44:22.277
I have a bullet
for you and you,

44:22.277 --> 44:24.708
and your fucking
girlfriend over here.

44:24.851 --> 44:26.700
How about it, hey?

44:28.683 --> 44:30.143
I can't hear you.

44:32.329 --> 44:34.407
What the fuck is wrong
with these people?

44:36.937 --> 44:39.410
You want to lick something?
Here, you can lick this.

44:39.716 --> 44:43.395
Come, put your mouth here, huh?

44:48.917 --> 44:51.497
I'm Tongan, you racist fuck.

44:52.311 --> 44:53.628
I'm not Maori.

45:03.167 --> 45:04.617
Get the fuck out of here.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.888
Come on, go inside.

45:09.985 --> 45:11.605
Fucking kids.

45:19.776 --> 45:20.995
Tea?

45:22.625 --> 45:24.150
You're our guest.

45:25.669 --> 45:27.486
You don't strike me
as a rev head.

45:28.500 --> 45:30.923
A good solid business.

45:31.616 --> 45:33.485
A good solid way
to wash drug money.

45:35.884 --> 45:38.325
You are not here for
friendly talk, are you?

45:39.292 --> 45:42.151
You're here to tell me to
stay away from Kings Cross.

45:42.311 --> 45:44.235
- Yeah.
- Or?

45:44.958 --> 45:46.234
It's not really a choice.

45:46.234 --> 45:48.605
Too late,
we are already there.

45:49.290 --> 45:50.322
My brother, Anh.

45:50.322 --> 45:51.717
Well, mate, you wish you were.

45:52.925 --> 45:58.146
Listen, my advice, just stay
out of this before people get hurt.

45:58.146 --> 45:59.322
Your people.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.839
This is Ezra speaking.

46:02.583 --> 46:04.031
I can hear his voice.

46:04.578 --> 46:06.599
Are you happy to be
a messenger boy?

46:08.212 --> 46:09.458
I'm no one's messenger.

46:09.458 --> 46:11.049
Aren't you delivering a
message?

46:11.049 --> 46:12.095
I'm delivering a message,

46:12.095 --> 46:13.941
but it's on behalf
of my brother and I

46:13.941 --> 46:15.847
because that's who
you'll be dealing with.

46:17.041 --> 46:19.615
Now look, I'm just,
I'm trying to avoid drama,

46:20.288 --> 46:22.708
because that's what smart
business people do.

46:22.708 --> 46:27.109
But, I'm beginning to see
that might not be possible.

46:27.917 --> 46:29.542
Where does Ezra fit?

46:29.542 --> 46:31.227
I don't know,
you'd have to ask him.

46:33.860 --> 46:37.759
I've been watching you,
even before your first club.

46:38.331 --> 46:40.371
- I've been watching you.
- I like you.

46:41.198 --> 46:42.668
I respect you.

46:43.128 --> 46:47.498
We are both children of war,
refugees trying to make good.

46:48.365 --> 46:51.197
We should be on the same
side, working together.

46:55.333 --> 46:56.511
You've been warned.

47:01.552 --> 47:02.702
Thanks for the tea.

47:19.336 --> 47:21.033
I'll be seeing
you again, shithead.

47:43.736 --> 47:45.621
Turn on your TV right now.

47:48.893 --> 47:51.022
Just to be
clear, you are alleging

47:51.022 --> 47:55.174
that this is not a case of one
or two corrupt police officers.

47:55.443 --> 47:56.380
No.

47:56.380 --> 47:57.864
What are
we talking then?

47:58.424 --> 47:59.837
The whole thing corrupt.

48:00.357 --> 48:02.622
The entire New South Wales
Police Force?

48:03.475 --> 48:06.392
That's an extraordinary claim.
What evidence do you have?

48:06.595 --> 48:09.883
I keep a list of
every cop I pay off.

48:09.883 --> 48:12.152
You're admitting
that you've been involved

48:12.152 --> 48:15.187
in illegal payments to
corrupt police officers?

48:15.944 --> 48:17.333
For protection?

48:18.708 --> 48:20.084
I have all their names.

48:20.630 --> 48:23.429
Maybe 80 cops,
they take my money.

48:23.769 --> 48:25.287
80?

48:25.625 --> 48:26.890
Why speak up now?

48:27.224 --> 48:30.420
There was always the
corruption, but now the cops,

48:30.507 --> 48:32.591
they are working
with drug dealers.

48:32.591 --> 48:34.266
They're worse than criminals.

48:34.650 --> 48:38.449
And because of these cops,
my Kings Cross is dying.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.995
And this break my heart.

48:46.693 --> 48:48.739
Aren't you worried
for your own safety?

48:51.290 --> 48:55.726
If anybody come near me,
I will tell their names.

48:56.419 --> 48:59.076
Do you think that'll
be enough to keep you safe?

48:59.715 --> 49:01.580
No, not enough.

49:19.708 --> 49:21.596
- Can we sit down?
- No.

49:26.374 --> 49:28.032
No one sent us, Nasa.

49:31.104 --> 49:33.188
We think you should
go away for a while.

49:33.788 --> 49:35.012
You do, huh?

49:35.290 --> 49:37.158
This Ibrahim's best advice.

49:37.158 --> 49:38.818
Yeah.
You and Arianna.

49:40.203 --> 49:43.079
Go to Lebanon, go to France.

49:43.079 --> 49:45.222
Go anywhere else,
just you can't be here.

49:45.222 --> 49:46.729
It's not safe anymore.

49:47.489 --> 49:50.767
You want me out of the way
for speaking the truth, hmm?

49:53.973 --> 49:55.650
Why don't you come stay
at my place tonight?

49:55.650 --> 49:57.092
Both of you?

49:57.290 --> 49:58.559
Yeah, we'll make dinner.

49:58.907 --> 50:00.996
I'll make some calls,
book some tickets.

50:01.316 --> 50:03.848
Whatever you need, you just
tell us, we'll help you.

50:03.848 --> 50:05.579
Why I take help
from you, huh?

50:05.579 --> 50:07.580
You two, you're never
there for me anymore.

50:07.580 --> 50:09.929
You, you're too busy
making business deals.

50:10.057 --> 50:12.149
And you, I don't know
where you go.

50:12.149 --> 50:16.266
Nasa, we're not trying
to push you out.

50:16.266 --> 50:17.581
We care about ya.

50:19.290 --> 50:20.590
We can wait our turn.

50:22.014 --> 50:24.053
Me in Lebanon,
your turn come fast.

50:24.053 --> 50:25.937
Come on, you know
that's not true.

50:27.492 --> 50:29.325
I not run away from nobody.

50:29.325 --> 50:31.086
Nasa, you know these people.

50:32.528 --> 50:33.968
They're not going
to let this go.

50:34.441 --> 50:36.774
2 Million people
watch me on TV, okay?

50:37.021 --> 50:39.185
If something happened to me,
they know who did it.

50:39.185 --> 50:40.955
But you'd be fucking dead.

50:41.521 --> 50:45.898
Listen, out here is
safest place for me to be.

50:45.898 --> 50:46.817
In the open.

50:47.186 --> 50:50.669
Don't worry,
I not name their names.

50:50.669 --> 50:52.329
I just say this to scare them.

50:53.616 --> 50:56.166
Why are you being
so fucking stupid?

50:58.122 --> 50:59.574
- Leave.
- Okay.

51:01.311 --> 51:02.311
Nasa.

51:04.216 --> 51:05.239
Go.

51:07.050 --> 51:08.376
I want you to go.

51:09.999 --> 51:11.226
No.

51:17.806 --> 51:18.924
John.

51:38.989 --> 51:40.206
Are you sure?

52:31.438 --> 52:32.855
Come here.

52:33.966 --> 52:35.230
You're scaring me.

52:35.444 --> 52:37.996
Fucking old bastard.
I should shoot him myself.

52:41.328 --> 52:43.352
Well, no one's going
to believe him anyway.

52:43.352 --> 52:45.187
How do I know, huh?

52:45.848 --> 52:47.154
How do I fucking know?

52:57.363 --> 52:58.919
Jesus, you're in knots.

53:06.917 --> 53:08.029
Where's the remote?

53:09.082 --> 53:11.253
Where's the fucking remote
for this thing, man?

53:12.283 --> 53:13.443
Where's the fucking
remote, man?

53:13.443 --> 53:14.716
Found it, here.

53:36.365 --> 53:37.834
Hey, Nasa!

53:52.838 --> 53:54.137
Nasa?

53:55.037 --> 53:56.617
Nasa?

53:57.361 --> 53:58.820
Nasa.

53:59.224 --> 54:02.200
Nasa, Nasa!

54:07.047 --> 54:09.711
Nasa!

54:17.297 --> 54:19.634
In breaking news,
a man has been killed

54:19.634 --> 54:21.741
in a drive-by shooting
earlier tonight

54:21.741 --> 54:24.891
in a quiet suburban street
here in Lindfield.

54:25.844 --> 54:29.266
The dead man is Kings Cross
identity Nasa Kalouri.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.098
Oh, fuck.

54:30.098 --> 54:30.900
Recently
at the centre

54:30.900 --> 54:33.901
of serious allegations against
New South Wales Police.

54:33.901 --> 54:35.503
I knew it,
I fucking knew it.

54:35.503 --> 54:38.154
I knew it, man!
I fucking knew it!

54:38.154 --> 54:39.542
It wasn't your fault.

54:40.125 --> 54:41.675
It's not your fault, Sam.

54:41.675 --> 54:43.639
Police have
established a crime scene at...

54:43.639 --> 54:45.314
- Look at me.
- Fuck off!

54:45.314 --> 54:47.677
...at the
sight of the shooting.

54:50.083 --> 54:52.429
Go, get the fuck out of here.

54:53.156 --> 54:54.613
Get the fuck out of here!

55:52.214 --> 55:54.506
A burned out
Mazda, police believe to be

55:54.506 --> 55:56.405
involved, has been
found in Zetland

55:56.405 --> 55:57.930
shortly after the incident.

55:57.930 --> 55:59.185
Far out.

55:59.558 --> 56:01.431
Acting Detective
Chief Inspector...

56:01.431 --> 56:02.413
What's it mean for us?

56:02.413 --> 56:05.196
Homicide says
the rise in shooting deaths

56:05.196 --> 56:06.514
in Sydney appears to...

56:06.514 --> 56:11.021
I don't know yet, but
that turf war I mentioned,

56:12.872 --> 56:14.902
a lot of folks are
going to get burned.
