WEBVTT

01:11.733 --> 01:14.150
- Stay on the beacon!
- Manolo, we lost the beacon.

01:14.317 --> 01:16.233
My God! My God!

01:17.233 --> 01:19.358
- What's our heading?
- I don't know.

01:19.525 --> 01:21.192
We lost all navigation.

01:22.233 --> 01:24.275
- Pull the nose up!
- I can't!

03:28.608 --> 03:30.733
Come on, pool is closed, everyone.
Out of the water.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.525
Stow that gear and get out of here.

03:32.692 --> 03:36.650
Get these divers out of the water.
Let's go, let's go. Come on, back here.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.983
- Taking too long.
- Watch your step. Here you go.

03:39.150 --> 03:41.817
- Assholes and elbows, that's all.
- You all right?

03:41.983 --> 03:45.275
Where's that fat guy's weight belt?
That's coming out of your pay, Jared.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.025
Would you shut up for two seconds?

03:47.233 --> 03:49.692
If I wanted that kind of lip,
I'd drop my fly. Let's go.

03:49.858 --> 03:52.692
What about my weight belt?
Those are 60 bucks a pop.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.858
You want me to take that out
of your paycheck?

03:55.067 --> 03:57.608
I'll tell you what, Bob.
I got him in, you get him out.

04:04.733 --> 04:08.525
Here at the Atlantis, we have the
largest marine habitat in the world.

04:08.733 --> 04:11.733
The nurse sharks in this habitat
grow up to 14 feet...

04:11.900 --> 04:14.442
... and feed differently
than most other sharks.

04:14.608 --> 04:18.024
They suck in their prey
with one powerful inhalation...

04:18.192 --> 04:20.358
... and they swallow it
pretty much whole.

04:21.567 --> 04:23.692
- Do you guys hear that?
- Yeah.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.275
Did you ever get bit?

04:25.442 --> 04:28.942
Yeah, Gina here got a little too frisky
with me one day last year.

04:29.108 --> 04:33.233
But for the most part, shark attacks are
just a simple case of mistaken identity.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.525
Hey, Boone.

05:08.317 --> 05:09.817
What's your daddy up to?

05:24.900 --> 05:27.233
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.983
- Smells good over there.
- What?

05:30.358 --> 05:31.817
Smells good in there.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.192
Yeah, that's my famous chili
and corn bread.

05:39.067 --> 05:40.358
What?

05:40.525 --> 05:42.567
Last time you made your chili
and corn bread...

05:42.733 --> 05:44.150
...your ex-girlfriend was here.

05:44.692 --> 05:47.358
Then, the time before that,
you brought home a pregnant...

05:47.567 --> 05:49.692
...flea-infested, three-legged dog.

05:49.983 --> 05:53.067
Last time a storm came through here,
like that last one...

05:53.233 --> 05:55.067
Kam Jackson...
You remember Kam Jackson?

05:55.233 --> 05:58.817
Found that golden cross, remember,
on the north side of the island?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.358
That hurricane that came through
moved so much sand...

06:01.567 --> 06:03.525
...who knows how many
shipwrecks it uncovered?

06:03.733 --> 06:06.483
So this is where
your chili comes in?

06:06.650 --> 06:08.483
I'm saying I should be
out prospecting.

06:08.650 --> 06:10.233
Quit your job?

06:10.400 --> 06:12.692
No, I was fired,
but it's all part of the plan.

06:12.858 --> 06:16.608
I'm just gonna get this thing going,
get the boat shaped up...

06:16.775 --> 06:20.317
...make a big find, and we'll live
the rest of our lives on our own clock.

06:20.483 --> 06:23.275
- I thought we already were.
- Yeah, but we'll be rich.

06:25.150 --> 06:26.650
You okay?

06:28.900 --> 06:30.275
Here, let me see.

06:34.358 --> 06:35.858
I'm all right.

06:36.067 --> 06:38.400
- Honey...
- Stinking boat.

06:39.108 --> 06:42.400
You know I'd live on this
broken boat with you, right?

06:43.942 --> 06:46.400
I love it when you say stuff like that.

06:59.233 --> 07:01.150
Hey. Hey.

07:02.692 --> 07:04.025
You guys okay?

07:05.358 --> 07:06.650
Yeah.

07:06.817 --> 07:10.025
Yeah, we're good, man.
Just plugging a few holes, you know?

07:10.858 --> 07:13.483
- Sea Robin looks great.
- Yeah, we just finished it.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.567
We got her out to sea
before the storm hit.

07:15.733 --> 07:18.525
- We've been working every day since.
- What are you looking for?

07:18.733 --> 07:20.567
They found the Titanic.
You didn't hear?

07:20.733 --> 07:22.358
Oh, you mean the one
with the dishes?

07:22.567 --> 07:25.775
No, I only hunt for stuff that comes
in gold and silver. You know that.

07:25.942 --> 07:27.775
Hey, Sam.

07:29.317 --> 07:31.025
Here.

07:33.608 --> 07:36.067
Found it this morning
where we were blowing a site.

07:36.233 --> 07:38.650
Maybe this guy can find a stone
to put in that thing.

07:38.817 --> 07:42.150
Hey, I'm sorry about your boat.
You want my guy to take a look at it?

07:42.442 --> 07:44.567
I think it's looking good.
Got it under control.

07:44.733 --> 07:46.858
All right.
Well, the least I can do is offer.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.233
Word on the water
is you're out of work.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.400
You can always come back
and work for me.

07:51.567 --> 07:53.150
No. I got my own thing going now.

07:53.692 --> 07:55.817
But if you wanna subcontract me,
that's cool.

07:55.983 --> 07:58.817
We can work something out.
Like a fifty-fifty thing, you know?

07:59.150 --> 08:02.567
You don't just take a rowboat out and
find a treasure chest filled with gold.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.733
It took me almost 10 years of scraping
till I found my first haul.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.150
Hey, I mean what I say.

08:08.317 --> 08:10.692
You need help getting back
in the water, let me know.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.858
- Move it out.
- Hey, Quinn.

08:13.067 --> 08:16.192
You wanna come work for a real
captain, you let me know, all right?

08:16.400 --> 08:19.650
Are you a captain now? You know,
the water goes outside of the boat.

08:22.150 --> 08:24.067
We'll see you, Sam.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.525
You know I can't slave
for Bates again.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.733
I know that.

09:00.317 --> 09:04.067
There's no way I'm gonna
bust my ass while he gets rich.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.108
Meanwhile, he's blasting holes
in the reef.

09:06.275 --> 09:09.108
- I just don't operate that way.
- I know, honey.

09:09.275 --> 09:11.608
I just want you to be happy, okay?

09:11.775 --> 09:13.067
You know that.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.733
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:47.692 --> 09:50.025
Welcome to the Bahamas.
It's a pleasure having you here.

09:50.233 --> 09:51.858
- Thank you.
- Welcome to paradise.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.692
It's a pleasure having you here, sir.

09:53.900 --> 09:56.358
It's a pleasure having me here too.
Thank you.

09:56.817 --> 09:57.983
Business or pleasure?

09:59.067 --> 10:01.275
Come on, bro, what do you think?

10:03.275 --> 10:04.567
Enjoy your stay.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.025
No way.

10:11.775 --> 10:13.400
It's Mr. OG Wannabe.

10:13.567 --> 10:15.817
What's up, you scruffy
little beach rat?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.275
Okay.

10:18.358 --> 10:20.358
I'm gonna throw your ass
right now. Watch.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.858
- Go to sleep, go to sleep.
- Okay, okay.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.858
All right.

10:26.233 --> 10:28.192
You've been spending
too much time in court.

10:28.358 --> 10:30.608
Wait, hold on, hold on.
Don't move for a second.

10:31.567 --> 10:33.525
Oh, that feels really good.

10:33.983 --> 10:35.483
You sick-ass.

10:35.650 --> 10:37.317
- What's up?
- Good to see you.

10:37.483 --> 10:39.983
- Good to see you too, bro.
- How's New York treating you?

10:40.192 --> 10:43.025
It's paying me. A lot of bad guys
need defending, I defend them.

10:43.192 --> 10:46.442
- That's what I do.
- That's still a scary thought.

10:46.608 --> 10:49.317
Oh, my God. Can I get a what-what
and a side of french fries?

10:49.483 --> 10:53.067
Look at that body.
It's ridiculous. Holy shit.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.400
- How much have you missed me?
- Oh, every minute.

10:55.567 --> 10:59.358
Oh, my God, it's so tight too.
It's like that everywhere, even.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.192
It's good to see you, Sam.
If we had met first, you and I...

11:02.400 --> 11:04.442
...things would be a lot different,
you know.

11:04.608 --> 11:06.358
Easy, cheesy.

11:06.567 --> 11:09.442
Anyway. Okay, so you must be Lisa?

11:10.233 --> 11:14.150
- Who's Lisa?
- Yeah, who the hell is Lisa?

11:14.317 --> 11:17.025
Amanda. Amanda.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.692
- Amanda.
- Hi, Amanda. I'm Sam.

11:19.858 --> 11:22.150
- Welcome to the Bahamas.
- Hi. Nice to meet you, Sam.

11:22.317 --> 11:23.650
- I'm Jared.
- Amanda.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.275
- Sorry about that.
- Let's go. These guys are ridiculous.

11:28.567 --> 11:31.067
- You're such an idiot.
- Decent save. You did good.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.525
No, that was horrible.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.108
I love the Caribbean.

11:34.275 --> 11:36.817
Too hot to wear shirts,
too hot to wear pants...

11:36.983 --> 11:39.442
...and we're two hot young ladies.

11:39.608 --> 11:42.858
- You dive?
- Yeah, I can keep up.

11:43.025 --> 11:45.483
So how long you known
this one for?

11:45.942 --> 11:48.400
I don't know, about 14 hours now.

11:48.567 --> 11:50.317
Picked her up last night
at The Mercer...

11:50.483 --> 11:54.025
I picked you up last night.
Don't start lying already.

11:54.733 --> 11:58.317
- So you and Bryce.
- I think I'm in love. Serious.

11:59.233 --> 12:01.108
I'm not serious.

12:03.067 --> 12:06.192
The guy who owned this place got hit
with 44 counts of racketeering...

12:06.400 --> 12:08.858
...and money laundering.
Our firm represented him.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.650
- This is how he floated the bill.
- You gotta be kidding me.

12:11.817 --> 12:16.442
Boat problem? No problem.
Boat and skis come with the crib.

12:16.817 --> 12:18.817
- We get the boat?
- You know how Daddy does it.

12:18.983 --> 12:20.567
- We get the boat?
- We get the boat.

12:20.733 --> 12:23.275
We get the boat! We get the boat!

12:56.192 --> 12:58.733
- Let's see it, bro, come on.
- Oh, my gosh.

13:05.233 --> 13:06.858
There he goes.

13:09.525 --> 13:11.858
How you like me now?

13:13.567 --> 13:15.692
That was so hot.

14:05.025 --> 14:07.233
- How sick was that?
- That was amazing.

14:29.108 --> 14:31.067
- Where are we?
- It's our secret spot.

14:31.233 --> 14:33.025
Amazing, isn't it?

14:53.942 --> 14:56.525
Shark, dude. Get out of the water.
There's a shark.

14:56.733 --> 14:58.108
Come on.

14:58.525 --> 14:59.900
Jared, get out. It's a shark.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.400
Come on, swim. Swim to me,
swim to me, Jared, swim to me.

15:03.567 --> 15:05.650
Get out, get out.
Come on, come on, get out.

15:05.817 --> 15:09.025
What are you laughing at? Get out.
There are sharks everywhere, look.

15:09.233 --> 15:10.900
Give me my mask
and my fins real quick.

15:11.067 --> 15:14.400
You... No, you don't need a mask.
There's a shark. He looks like Jaws.

15:14.608 --> 15:16.192
- Get out.
- Yeah, but I lost my watch.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.317
You lost...?
You need an arm to wear a watch.

15:18.483 --> 15:20.192
Would you get out
of the water, stupid?

15:20.358 --> 15:22.983
- Sam gave me it for my birthday.
- I don't care. Sam, get...

15:23.150 --> 15:25.233
- What are you doing?
- They're just curious.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.067
Curious as to what? As to what?
What his ass tastes like?

15:28.233 --> 15:31.150
Dude, get out. Seri...
Oh, my God, look at that. That shark.

15:31.317 --> 15:34.317
- Hold on. Hold.
- Sam, what is he doing?

15:35.150 --> 15:36.733
Right there, right there.

15:38.233 --> 15:39.525
You cool?

15:40.442 --> 15:43.275
Don't do that.
Come on, don't do that.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.900
- It's not funny?
- No.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.442
Look. Look what I found.

16:54.275 --> 16:55.650
No way. That's a rock, honey.

16:55.817 --> 16:58.358
Three-minute breath-hold
and the guy comes up with a rock.

16:58.567 --> 17:02.650
I mean, what are the odds of that?
Wait till I tell the boys at the office.

17:02.817 --> 17:04.983
No, that's a ballast stone, man.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.317
Ships used to carry them
in their hull.

17:07.733 --> 17:10.733
Wow, right.
Well, I got a box of Cohibas...

17:10.900 --> 17:14.983
...and some rum from back in the day
over on the land part of Earth. Let's...

17:15.150 --> 17:16.775
Let's handle it over there,
you know?

17:16.942 --> 17:19.900
He always finds these things.
It's the ship that's always missing.

17:20.067 --> 17:23.108
Help me out. Let's get back in
the water before the sun goes down.

17:23.275 --> 17:25.358
Really? You think there's
something down there?

17:25.525 --> 17:26.858
I don't know. Grab your stuff.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.192
Hold on. Are you insane?

17:28.400 --> 17:31.400
You think I'm going back in there
with those things? I'm mad at you.

17:31.567 --> 17:34.192
They're not aggressive.
It's tiger sharks you should avoid.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.025
Yeah, she's right.
Those tiger sharks are bad news.

17:37.192 --> 17:40.067
Those are the ones that are furry
and have the stripes on them.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.900
That was a joke.
He's funny now, this guy. Okay.

17:43.067 --> 17:45.067
Yeah, no,
I'm not getting in the water.

19:35.817 --> 19:37.817
It's gold, right?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.275
You find something?

21:39.733 --> 21:41.192
Yeah.

21:41.858 --> 21:44.775
- What?
- A plane.

21:45.192 --> 21:47.317
Like an airplane?

21:47.483 --> 21:49.817
Yeah, like an airplane.

21:50.525 --> 21:52.108
Well, that's odd.

23:39.025 --> 23:40.983
How many of these
do you think are down there?

23:41.192 --> 23:43.692
I don't know, enough bricks
to build a house.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.942
A multimillion-dollar
cocaine palace.

23:47.858 --> 23:52.275
With a pool and a waterfall and
a giraffe nibbling on the front yard.

23:52.442 --> 23:54.858
How about a prison cell
with no sunlight for 10 years?

24:02.567 --> 24:04.400
Yeah, we're out of here.

24:05.733 --> 24:07.817
Jared, what about this?

24:10.108 --> 24:12.525
- What-y-what-what?
- Come on, Amanda, don't be stupid.

24:12.733 --> 24:15.275
- Oh, we're not gonna get caught.
- You're right, we're not.

24:15.442 --> 24:17.067
Come on. It's for us.
Come on, relax.

24:17.233 --> 24:19.067
- I am.
- We'll save it for a rainy day.

24:19.233 --> 24:21.025
- Or a rainy month.
- Come on, seriously.

24:21.192 --> 24:23.192
- Maybe a sunny day?
- Let me see it real quick.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.817
Hey, Sam. Come here.
Hey. Wait, wait.

24:26.442 --> 24:28.067
Come here, come here.
Sam, Sam, stop.

24:28.692 --> 24:31.400
Let's just let the defense present
its case for a second.

24:31.567 --> 24:33.150
- All right.
- I don't do drugs.

24:33.358 --> 24:34.692
- I hate drugs.
- Sure.

24:34.900 --> 24:38.275
But throwing this away, I don't know.
Maybe I object. Silly, right?

24:38.442 --> 24:40.192
Throwing it away,
doesn't it seem silly?

24:40.650 --> 24:42.733
Throwing it in the...
In the ocean?

24:42.900 --> 24:44.483
- Trash?
- Wait, let me see this.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.400
I think, you know, it would be...
What are you doing?

24:47.567 --> 24:49.525
It's going away.

24:50.233 --> 24:51.483
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:52.192 --> 24:54.067
Wow, that's intense.

24:56.692 --> 24:58.067
That's a new boat, Jared.

24:58.900 --> 25:02.025
That's a new b...
Threw away a new boat. Okay.

25:02.192 --> 25:05.025
- We're out of here.
- Threw a new boat into the ocean.

25:05.525 --> 25:07.900
You guys are a lot of fun.

25:09.025 --> 25:10.858
You're gonna keep this,
though, right?

25:11.067 --> 25:13.358
Yep. Jackass.

25:13.525 --> 25:14.733
Okay, good.

25:17.233 --> 25:20.275
What do you think, Jared? You think
there's more treasure down there?

25:20.692 --> 25:24.858
- Big storms bring big treasure.
- Oh, good. What does that mean?

25:26.233 --> 25:29.567
What she's saying is that hurricanes
like the one that came through here...

25:29.733 --> 25:32.775
...sometimes what they do is they sift
stuff out that's been buried.

25:33.567 --> 25:35.858
Good, so we go back tomorrow
and we dig.

25:36.067 --> 25:38.192
Not if we report that plane crash.

25:38.358 --> 25:40.025
The place will turn
into a crime scene.

25:40.233 --> 25:43.650
Coast Guard, DEA. They'll be all over
it and we'll never get near it again.

25:43.817 --> 25:45.983
What happened to
"finders keepers, losers weepers"?

25:46.150 --> 25:48.192
The law down here
doesn't play by those rules.

25:48.608 --> 25:51.150
See, the thing of it is,
you have to file a claim.

25:51.358 --> 25:53.942
In order to file a claim,
you have to identify the wreck.

25:54.108 --> 25:58.775
We have to be able to name
what it was and where it came from.

25:59.192 --> 26:02.733
So like I keep saying, we go down
tomorrow and we dig and we find out.

26:02.900 --> 26:05.108
- What about the plane?
- What about the plane?

26:05.733 --> 26:08.233
We found bodies. Don't you think
we should tell someone?

26:08.567 --> 26:11.192
They're drug dealers, Sam.
They're not missionaries...

26:11.400 --> 26:14.233
...flying care packages
to starving kids in Africa. Okay?

26:14.400 --> 26:16.733
Don't worry. Their girlfriends
will have new pimps...

26:16.900 --> 26:19.525
...before the milk in the refrigerator
goes bad. It's fine.

26:19.775 --> 26:22.192
Don't you think somebody
wants their lost luggage?

26:22.400 --> 26:24.358
I'm sure that they do,
I'm sure that they do.

26:24.567 --> 26:26.942
All the more reason we need to
keep our mouths closed.

26:27.233 --> 26:30.775
Yeah, because, you know,
loose lips, they sink ships.

26:31.108 --> 26:33.275
That's right, baby.
Loose lips do sink ships.

26:33.442 --> 26:37.650
Now, look, what we do is we go down,
we identify the wreck...

26:37.817 --> 26:40.317
...and then we call in the plane.

26:40.483 --> 26:43.858
Right? Unless... Unless you don't have
a problem with somebody else...

26:44.025 --> 26:46.275
...laying claim on your treasure.

26:46.775 --> 26:50.317
These aren't like those shipwrecks
you have at the bottom of a fish tank.

26:50.525 --> 26:54.358
I mean, it could be spread
all over the ocean floor.

26:54.567 --> 26:56.483
She's right.

26:58.733 --> 27:01.358
But, Sam, I really think
we can do this.

27:02.733 --> 27:05.192
And the equipment we need
and don't have?

27:05.942 --> 27:08.358
That's where Mr. Deep Pockets
comes in.

27:08.525 --> 27:09.900
- Right?
- That's right.

27:10.067 --> 27:11.775
The Kid.

27:14.442 --> 27:17.025
The bottom line is we could
spend the rest of our lives...

27:17.233 --> 27:19.983
...waiting for another
opportunity like this.

27:23.775 --> 27:25.525
- All right.
- What?

27:25.733 --> 27:28.567
- All right.
- Come on, excitement, a little bit.

27:28.733 --> 27:30.775
- Can we have some fun...?
- Under one condition.

27:30.942 --> 27:32.983
- Fine.
- We report that plane...

27:33.150 --> 27:35.317
...as soon as we can
make a claim...

27:35.483 --> 27:38.233
...and we stay the hell away
from it until then.

27:39.817 --> 27:41.067
Don't look at me.

27:41.817 --> 27:44.567
Come on, guys. I'll just stay here
and suck on my thumb...

27:44.733 --> 27:46.608
...while you play
Pirates of the Caribbean.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.067
All right, one more thing, though.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.608
Not a word to anyone.

27:52.775 --> 27:54.358
Okay?

27:54.900 --> 27:57.775
Got it, got it, got it. We're good.
Can we drink to this, please?

27:58.692 --> 28:01.192
- We're gonna be rich, people.
- Cheers, big ears.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.942
- Cheers.
- Cheers to being loaded.

28:06.567 --> 28:09.192
Check it out, though,
I need a... I need a compressor...

28:09.400 --> 28:13.400
...air lifts, four sets of AGA gear,
hookah rigs.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.275
- You got all that?
- Ain't no thing.

28:15.442 --> 28:18.358
No? What about a boat that's
already dialed in with electronics?

28:18.525 --> 28:20.858
- Not a problem.
- Please don't put me on hold.

28:21.067 --> 28:24.442
I need a magnetometer,
I need a side scan sonar.

28:24.608 --> 28:26.733
I can set you up with
that whole boat over there.

28:26.900 --> 28:29.192
Sonar, blower,
the whole ball of wax, man.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.192
But you gotta pay.

28:31.358 --> 28:33.025
- How much?
- Thirty grand.

28:33.192 --> 28:36.692
Hello? Hello? Are you there?

28:37.192 --> 28:38.900
What's he doing?
He's tripping me out.

28:39.067 --> 28:42.192
No, he's the bank. He's putting
together the funds. Thirty grand?

28:42.400 --> 28:44.067
Thirty grand.
I'll give you two weeks.

28:44.483 --> 28:48.525
I'll carry the note.
You do good, you get the toys.

28:48.733 --> 28:50.775
What do you mean, a meeting?
He's a criminal.

28:50.942 --> 28:52.858
Criminals don't have meetings.

28:53.025 --> 28:54.775
- Look, no, don't hang...
- What's up?

28:54.942 --> 28:58.358
I can't believe this guy. The nerve.
I cannot understand it.

28:58.525 --> 29:00.400
I basically saved this guy's life.

29:00.567 --> 29:02.567
Ten years at Leavenwon'th,
and I get him off.

29:02.733 --> 29:05.150
He can't float me
a couple thousand dollars.

29:05.317 --> 29:06.817
So, what are you saying?

29:06.983 --> 29:09.150
You don't have any money?
You're tapped out?

29:09.317 --> 29:12.275
- Dude, I told you about Vegas.
- But you told me it was no big deal.

29:12.442 --> 29:15.150
- You told me it wasn't a problem.
- I lied. Yeah.

29:15.317 --> 29:18.025
- I lied. I got a pride problem.
- Why didn't you tell me that?

29:18.192 --> 29:20.483
Tell you what? What do you
wanna hear, my sob story?

29:20.650 --> 29:23.192
Here it is, Jared. I borrowed money
from the wrong people.

29:23.400 --> 29:26.150
I took out a loan
and now I'm really weighed down.

29:26.317 --> 29:28.733
Yeah, you should've told me
you didn't have any money.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.233
You gonna float my marker?

29:30.400 --> 29:33.442
You gonna cash in
all your Subway stamps?

29:34.567 --> 29:36.275
I'm just...

29:37.150 --> 29:39.025
Why didn't you tell me, bro?

29:39.192 --> 29:41.317
Why did we come here
if you don't have any money?

29:41.692 --> 29:43.400
Wasting our time.

29:43.567 --> 29:45.400
This is bullshit.

29:48.567 --> 29:50.317
Bye.

29:51.775 --> 29:53.317
Hey, it's me.

29:53.483 --> 29:56.525
I got some info that might kick you
in the balls and make you cough.

32:59.317 --> 33:00.900
Yo, check this out.

33:01.067 --> 33:02.108
- Look.
- Where's Amanda?

33:02.275 --> 33:04.108
- She's with you.
- Give me your tank.

33:04.275 --> 33:05.733
- What's going on?
- Give me a tank.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.233
She's not with you?

33:07.400 --> 33:09.400
- Give me that tank. Come on.
- Jesus Christ.

33:09.567 --> 33:10.900
- Come on.
- Tank, tank, tank.

34:08.150 --> 34:10.817
- What are you doing in here?
- What do you think I'm doing?

34:11.317 --> 34:12.900
I was looking for your stupid ship.

34:13.067 --> 34:16.983
I turned around, and you disappeared.
So I came in here looking for you.

34:19.275 --> 34:22.442
- What?
- I told you to stay away from the plane.

34:22.858 --> 34:24.942
I didn't take anything.

34:26.775 --> 34:29.858
You wanna search me?
Here, go ahead.

34:32.567 --> 34:34.317
We're out of here.

34:41.317 --> 34:43.692
Salt water converts silver
into silver sulfide...

34:43.900 --> 34:46.233
...and electrolytic reduction
reverses the process.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.442
Whatever, bro. Just hurry up
and turn it back into treasure.

34:52.775 --> 34:56.525
It's an old cap-and-ball.
That's a old-school gun right there.

34:56.692 --> 34:59.817
- Let me see that.
- See the hammer, the trigger?

34:59.983 --> 35:02.442
What is this...? These markings?

35:02.608 --> 35:04.525
Give it to the Mexican.
What does that say?

35:04.692 --> 35:06.358
You're such an ass.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.567
- That's not Spanish.
- Let me see it.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.358
Oh, it's Latin. "Sic semper tyrannis."

35:14.817 --> 35:17.400
"Thus always a tyrant."

35:18.733 --> 35:20.817
What? Catholic boarding school.

35:20.983 --> 35:23.192
So, what, it's a Roman ship?

35:23.358 --> 35:25.650
Seventeenth-century Indian dagger?
I don't think so.

35:26.067 --> 35:27.733
No, this is an American ship.

35:28.567 --> 35:30.150
Here it is, right here.

35:30.317 --> 35:33.233
"Sic semper tyrannis:
Thus ever to tyrants."

35:33.400 --> 35:35.483
You were close.
"The motto of Virginia...

35:35.692 --> 35:37.983
...said to have been shouted
by John Wilkes Booth...

35:38.150 --> 35:42.192
...after he had assassinated
Abraham Lincoln in 1865."

35:42.400 --> 35:44.900
Jared. Check this out.

35:46.483 --> 35:48.525
Doesn't that look like a map
of New Providence?

35:48.733 --> 35:51.108
- That's this island, right?
- Yeah.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.192
Silver powder horn.

35:54.900 --> 35:58.525
- Silver horn and two silver guns.
- What?

35:58.692 --> 36:00.817
"Later they confirmed it was
the slave-pirate...

36:00.983 --> 36:03.817
...by the silver horn and two
silver guns he was never without."

36:03.983 --> 36:05.692
And this was his, right here.

36:05.900 --> 36:07.275
- Whose?
- Tillman Thorp's.

36:07.442 --> 36:10.608
- The runaway slave turned pirate.
- He was crazy. He ran the Everglades.

36:10.858 --> 36:13.650
He and his crew were gnarly.
They ate alligators, drank lead...

36:13.817 --> 36:17.275
...pissed musket balls, gave the
Confederates hell. It was like revenge.

36:17.442 --> 36:18.650
He just worked them.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.775
So this is Snoop Dogg Silver.

36:24.942 --> 36:27.067
These are the homies
over here, chilling.

36:27.233 --> 36:29.108
- Look at that guy drinking a 40.
- Chilling?

36:29.275 --> 36:30.567
Chilling. Yeah.

36:30.733 --> 36:32.150
So, what do you think we got?

36:32.317 --> 36:36.025
Some Confederate flags and old
Skynyrd tapes down there or what?

36:36.233 --> 36:39.900
No, I don't think we found his ship.
I think we found the Zephyr.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.942
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:42.692 --> 36:45.108
The Zephyr was a clipper ship
owned by this wealthy...

36:45.275 --> 36:48.942
...French trader, lived in New Orleans.
The war broke out, and he freaked out.

36:49.108 --> 36:51.192
He takes his ship, family,
throws them onboard.

36:51.400 --> 36:54.317
His antiques, valuables, gold, silver,
whatever he's got, onboard.

36:54.483 --> 36:56.150
They try to make a beeline
for France.

36:56.317 --> 37:01.150
Okay, but Mr. Two Guns and a Horn
here screws up his itinerary, right?

37:01.317 --> 37:04.358
The ship wasn't all he took. He also
took the Frenchman's daughter.

37:04.567 --> 37:07.858
- He kidnapped her?
- No. She ran away with him.

37:08.067 --> 37:10.275
Long after the ship was sunk...

37:10.442 --> 37:12.733
...they were spotted living together
in Eleuthera.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.858
Oh, my God, this is a fairy tale.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.733
They knew the French
would catch up...

37:16.900 --> 37:20.233
...so they sunk the ship
to throw them off their trail.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.942
Right. Gave up the gold for a girl.

37:24.108 --> 37:26.775
Stop kissing.
First of all, it's disgusting.

37:26.942 --> 37:31.525
Stop kissing. No self-respecting pirate
would do that, okay?

37:31.692 --> 37:35.150
That's ridiculous.
Ten-to-one, this guy got so deep...

37:35.358 --> 37:39.067
...into that fine,
white, French "poo-needy"...

37:39.233 --> 37:41.942
- "Needy"?
- "Needada," that he took his eyes...

37:42.108 --> 37:44.733
...off the road and crashed,
splash, right into a rock.

37:44.900 --> 37:46.233
- Guys.
- That's what happened.

37:46.567 --> 37:50.275
- This is my new Romeo, right here.
- It's reality.

37:50.442 --> 37:51.983
I really don't care what happened.

37:52.150 --> 37:54.150
The bottom line is,
the Zephyr's down there.

37:54.358 --> 37:55.900
And if we found it...

37:56.067 --> 37:59.650
...we have hit the mother lode
of mother lodes.

37:59.817 --> 38:03.525
What kind of mother lode are we
talking about here? For real. Reality.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.608
Tens of millions.

38:08.442 --> 38:10.067
In 1861.

38:12.483 --> 38:15.650
- Sounds like hundreds of millions.
- More.

38:15.817 --> 38:17.317
That's insane.

38:17.525 --> 38:19.275
Okay, this is the hook, though.

38:19.442 --> 38:21.400
If we want it to be ours,
clean and clear...

38:21.567 --> 38:23.817
...like, legal, no ifs, ands or buts...

38:23.983 --> 38:27.483
...we have to come up with something
that says "the Zephyr" on it. Anything.

38:27.692 --> 38:30.108
No, no.
What we need to do...

38:30.567 --> 38:34.067
...is figure out what thousands
of millions divided by four equals.

38:34.233 --> 38:36.233
That's what we need to figure out.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.275
- God, it's so crazy.
- I can't imagine.

38:50.108 --> 38:52.650
Hey, Amanda,
you're gonna stay topside.

38:53.150 --> 38:54.692
Why?

38:55.650 --> 38:58.400
Because you need to keep
an eye open for visitors.

38:58.567 --> 39:00.858
- Well, I still get my cut, right?
- Of course, baby.

39:01.025 --> 39:02.275
We're all equal partners.

39:03.858 --> 39:08.192
All right. I'll stay up here
and I will work on my tan.

41:21.858 --> 41:23.317
Tie on.

41:23.775 --> 41:25.733
Everything okay out here?

41:25.900 --> 41:27.942
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You sure?

41:28.108 --> 41:30.775
Yeah, you know, just trying
to even out my naughty bits.

41:33.025 --> 41:34.608
Can you cover yourself up, miss?

41:35.400 --> 41:36.483
Sure.

41:50.567 --> 41:53.858
Do you have any drugs
or weapons onboard?

41:54.025 --> 41:56.358
- No, I don't.
- This is Bahamian water.

41:56.525 --> 41:58.108
We have the right
to search the boat.

43:05.858 --> 43:08.192
Sir, I found something.

43:09.775 --> 43:11.608
Looks like prescription drugs to me.

43:14.900 --> 43:16.692
Are these yours?

43:16.858 --> 43:19.150
No, they're not mine.

43:53.275 --> 43:54.483
What's your name, miss?

43:56.442 --> 43:57.483
Amanda.

44:40.692 --> 44:42.192
Yo, is everything cool?

44:43.108 --> 44:45.192
- Jared?
- Hey.

44:45.983 --> 44:48.358
Yeah, everything is cool.
I didn't recognize the boat.

44:48.692 --> 44:50.192
Yeah, it's a friend of mine's.

44:50.400 --> 44:53.608
- Hey, Sam, how you doing?
- Hey, Roy.

44:55.608 --> 44:56.858
Good.

44:57.025 --> 44:59.317
- How's Allison and Emily?
- They're good, good.

44:59.483 --> 45:01.358
All right, guys, wrap it up.

45:01.525 --> 45:03.108
Roy, this is my friend, Bryce.

45:03.817 --> 45:05.900
- Hey, Bryce.
- How you doing?

45:06.067 --> 45:09.275
- That's Amanda up there.
- We met. How you doing?

45:09.442 --> 45:11.567
What happened
to your friend's arm?

45:11.733 --> 45:15.233
Oh, I just... Got a little too close
to the fire coral.

45:15.650 --> 45:17.525
Better wrap that up good.

45:17.983 --> 45:19.733
Why didn't you have
a "diver down" flag?

45:19.900 --> 45:22.692
Yeah, I know, I just...
I got lazy, man, you know.

45:22.858 --> 45:25.983
There's not a lot of boat traffic
out here, just a bunch of jellyfish.

45:26.192 --> 45:29.025
And drug traffickers.
Flying their planes in from Colombia...

45:29.192 --> 45:31.775
...dropping loads in the water.
You know. Boat like this...

45:31.942 --> 45:34.733
We just saw a shark fin and,
I don't know, I couldn't resist.

45:34.900 --> 45:37.317
Wanted to show these mainlanders
a real shark.

45:37.483 --> 45:39.775
- Yeah.
- Didn't really think too much about it.

45:39.942 --> 45:42.233
- Right. Nice.
- Yeah.

45:42.400 --> 45:45.067
Came a little too close.
I almost pissed in my Speedo.

45:46.692 --> 45:48.817
You crazy. If I saw a shark...

45:49.025 --> 45:51.608
...l'd be like Jesus of Nazareth
and run across that water.

45:51.775 --> 45:53.525
You hear what I'm saying?

45:53.692 --> 45:55.692
All right, brother. All right, girl.

45:55.858 --> 45:57.650
- Can't wait to see the girls.
- All right.

45:58.858 --> 46:00.525
Take care of that arm.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.858
- I will.
- See you, Roy.

46:03.025 --> 46:07.025
- All right, guys, let's go.
- Bye, guys. Have a good day.

46:07.442 --> 46:09.983
Bye. Bye, boys. Thanks.

46:28.067 --> 46:32.692
If everything pans out correctly,
we're gonna be doing a fifty-fifty split.

46:32.858 --> 46:34.900
That's half for me,
and half for you and Sam.

46:35.067 --> 46:38.233
- Well, what do you mean?
- Don't say it. Do not say it.

46:38.400 --> 46:42.275
Amanda? Not family. You, I? Family.
Amanda, not family.

46:42.442 --> 46:44.150
- You'd cu...? You'd cut her out?
- Yeah.

46:44.317 --> 46:47.025
- Guaranteed, she's telling everyone.
- She's gonna talk?

46:47.192 --> 46:48.900
- Yeah.
- No, if she talks, we'll...

46:49.067 --> 46:52.358
We'll have her in the Special Olympics
next year. She's not gonna talk.

46:52.525 --> 46:54.067
Guys.

46:56.192 --> 46:57.692
Let's go. Now. Come on.

46:57.858 --> 47:00.358
- What?
- Protect my ass. Come on.

47:25.108 --> 47:29.817
- Hey. I gotta go cool off.
- What?

47:42.817 --> 47:44.692
- Hey, Jared.
- Hey, what's up, Danny?

47:44.858 --> 47:47.275
Listen, some pointy-looking dreads
been asking for you.

47:47.442 --> 47:48.900
It was freaking me out a little.

47:49.067 --> 47:52.108
They was all up in my mouth, like,
you know, "Where you been diving?

47:52.275 --> 47:55.150
- Who you been hanging out with?"
- What did you tell them?

47:55.317 --> 47:59.483
I didn't say shit. I don't know nothing.
I got your back, dog. Trust me on that.

48:00.358 --> 48:03.817
But they don't look like they
from around here, that's for sure.

48:05.900 --> 48:07.900
Yeah, well, I appreciate
the heads up. Thanks.

48:08.067 --> 48:10.358
- Everything cool?
- Yeah.

48:10.525 --> 48:13.358
Yeah, everything's cool. Thanks,
though, Danny. I appreciate it.

48:13.900 --> 48:16.483
Wet white guy coming through.

48:17.692 --> 48:20.192
Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

48:21.442 --> 48:23.108
Where's Amanda?

48:23.275 --> 48:24.567
I don't know.

48:25.858 --> 48:27.358
No?

48:54.650 --> 48:57.025
Hey, my man. My man.

48:57.442 --> 48:59.400
My man. Girl's with me.

48:59.567 --> 49:01.317
Just talking to the lady, my boy.

49:01.483 --> 49:03.858
- I'm just telling you she's with me.
- Baby, it's cool.

49:04.025 --> 49:06.858
- What's cool?
- This is Primo. He owns this joint.

49:07.025 --> 49:09.525
- What's up, my man?
- No, we're good, bro. We're good.

49:09.900 --> 49:11.858
- Great.
- Come on.

49:12.025 --> 49:15.150
Hey, you wanna...?
You wanna do a little...? Little bump?

49:16.233 --> 49:17.525
Yeah, yeah, let's do a bump.

49:17.692 --> 49:20.775
That shit's for losers.
You know what I mean? Let's go.

49:21.483 --> 49:23.525
Ask her how she was
gonna pay for it.

49:23.692 --> 49:27.067
- How she was gonna pay for it?
- Yeah. Ask how she was gonna pay.

49:27.567 --> 49:29.108
Here, hold this.

49:30.192 --> 49:31.858
Hey, hey.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.733
Oh, shit.

49:37.942 --> 49:39.858
Watch out. Watch out.
Get out of the way.

49:40.025 --> 49:41.233
Get out of the way!

49:47.358 --> 49:48.858
Hey.

49:49.650 --> 49:51.067
Hey, cut it out.

49:52.650 --> 49:54.108
- Talk to your boy, Jared.
- Primo...

49:54.275 --> 49:56.192
- Talk to your boy.
- Come on.

49:56.358 --> 49:58.692
- Chill out.
- You're a bitch.

49:58.858 --> 50:00.483
- Don't.
- I'll murder you, boy.

50:05.483 --> 50:07.900
- Jared, this just sucks.
- What's your problem, Bryce?

50:08.067 --> 50:10.233
- I ain't got a problem.
- What's your problem?

50:10.400 --> 50:12.275
What are you looking at?

50:12.608 --> 50:14.400
He's not the guy to pick a fight with.

50:14.567 --> 50:16.858
- I didn't pick a fight.
- No, he didn't pick a fight.

50:17.025 --> 50:18.983
- I didn't do it.
- He just punched the guy.

50:19.150 --> 50:21.233
- Shut up. Shut up.
- You're awesome. Real tough.

50:21.400 --> 50:24.358
You know what, you shut up.
And don't screw this up.

50:24.525 --> 50:27.275
Okay, I'm so... I'm sorry, okay?

50:27.442 --> 50:31.150
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- All set, let's go, come on.

51:33.025 --> 51:34.275
Come on.

52:12.650 --> 52:14.567
You all right? You all right?

52:14.775 --> 52:18.400
All right, let's go, let's go.
Get the heck out of here, man.

52:25.733 --> 52:28.650
Mother flip.
My jaw must be broken.

52:30.358 --> 52:32.608
What the hell was that all about?

52:37.692 --> 52:41.358
Okay, let's gather around here.
You wanna stay away from the ropes.

52:41.525 --> 52:44.400
- Now, you guys know what these are?
- No.

52:44.567 --> 52:46.192
They're called "mailboxes."

52:50.775 --> 52:52.358
Hit it.

52:52.525 --> 52:53.775
Now, watch this.

52:54.567 --> 52:57.942
We use the mailboxes to deflect
the prop wash, right?

52:58.108 --> 53:02.858
To blow away sand and debris
so we can find sunken ships.

53:03.025 --> 53:06.067
All right? Now... Hey.
Oh, my God, what is that?

53:06.233 --> 53:08.192
- What is that?
- It's a pirate.

53:08.358 --> 53:09.858
- It's a pirate.
- It's a pirate.

53:10.025 --> 53:12.025
- What does he have?
- Treasure.

53:12.192 --> 53:14.025
Treasure.

53:14.192 --> 53:15.608
There we go.

53:16.358 --> 53:18.442
Yeah, enough chocolate
for everybody.

53:19.650 --> 53:22.358
Like I told you,
I'm not a treasure hunter, I'm a?

53:22.525 --> 53:25.817
- Treasure finder.
- Finder! Yeah.

53:25.983 --> 53:28.650
- Bye, pirates.
- Bye.

53:30.025 --> 53:33.358
- Bye. Thank you.
- Hey, absolutely. It was a blast.

53:33.525 --> 53:36.233
- I hope you guys come back.
- Thank you.

53:36.858 --> 53:39.692
- See you guys later.
- Bye.

53:39.858 --> 53:41.067
Have fun back at school.

53:42.483 --> 53:45.525
Hey, Jared. What's up, man?

53:45.692 --> 53:49.358
The Bonzel was that wreck
you found off Mysterioso Bank.

53:49.525 --> 53:51.275
- What's going on, captain?
- Don't know.

53:52.858 --> 53:56.442
Jared here found a hat. Seems pretty
excited about it, you know?

53:56.608 --> 54:00.275
I don't normally buy back
old souvenirs I sell, but, you know...

54:00.442 --> 54:02.692
...if you need the dough
and, you know...

54:02.858 --> 54:04.442
Just tell your boys to back off.

54:05.358 --> 54:07.067
My boys?

54:07.233 --> 54:10.692
- You boys been bothering this man?
- No, sir, captain.

54:10.858 --> 54:13.525
I got over 100 people that worked
for me on the Bonzel.

54:13.692 --> 54:15.983
I sold a shitload of hats...

54:16.150 --> 54:18.733
...so this could belong to anybody.

54:21.108 --> 54:22.983
Just stay away from us, okay?

54:23.400 --> 54:26.942
Look, you're the one who boarded
my boat without permission.

54:27.108 --> 54:30.317
You realize people still get shot
for that down here?

54:34.192 --> 54:36.483
Time and money, Jared.

54:36.650 --> 54:40.817
That's what it takes to bring stuff up
from the bottom of the sea. I got both.

54:41.317 --> 54:42.900
What do you got?

54:43.067 --> 54:46.150
Borrowed time and a borrowed dime?
That must suck.

54:49.192 --> 54:50.817
All right, you take care.

54:52.483 --> 54:54.150
Drive safe.

55:01.442 --> 55:04.608
Do you realize it's just a matter of time
until Bates finds that wreck.

55:04.775 --> 55:07.317
Meantime, we're crawling around
the bottom of the ocean...

55:07.525 --> 55:09.650
...digging for treasure
with spoons, man.

55:09.858 --> 55:12.108
Yeah, and I know...

55:12.442 --> 55:15.900
...where to get the money
to get the stuff that we need...

55:16.067 --> 55:19.150
...only I can't go down
and get it by myself.

55:20.067 --> 55:22.442
No, we've already talked
about that.

55:22.942 --> 55:24.858
But what are we talking about?

55:25.025 --> 55:27.567
What are we talking about?
We're not talking about a lot.

55:27.733 --> 55:30.525
We're talking about just enough
to get what we need.

55:32.650 --> 55:36.692
Look at me right now in my face and
tell me you haven't thought about it.

55:37.525 --> 55:39.692
Well, you know I've thought about it.

55:39.858 --> 55:42.858
But have you thought about
the penalties here for drug trafficking?

55:43.025 --> 55:45.483
- I know what they are.
- They throw you under the prison.

55:45.650 --> 55:47.150
Nope. Nope. Maximum...

55:47.358 --> 55:49.817
Maximum first-time offense
for trafficking, Jared?

55:50.025 --> 55:52.567
You know what it is? Five years.
Five years, Jared.

55:52.733 --> 55:55.483
It took me longer to get through
law school and pass the bar.

55:55.650 --> 55:56.858
- Only five years, huh?
- Yeah.

55:57.025 --> 55:59.650
Man, you wouldn't last five days
in Fox Hill Prison.

55:59.817 --> 56:01.733
You know what, man?
We're risking our lives.

56:01.900 --> 56:03.775
We're risking our lives
every single day...

56:03.942 --> 56:06.525
...looking for a 150-year-old ship
that might be buried...

56:06.692 --> 56:10.608
...under the bottom of the ocean,
while 100 million, easy...

56:10.775 --> 56:13.025
...easy, sits in a plane
200 yards away.

56:13.858 --> 56:16.067
We could get that money we need
to get that boat.

56:16.233 --> 56:19.525
And what do we do? Keep swimming
on by it like it doesn't even exist.

56:19.692 --> 56:21.400
Tell me what's crazy.

56:21.608 --> 56:23.733
Jesus Chri...
Jared, I've dealt with these people.

56:23.900 --> 56:25.442
I defended these people.

56:25.608 --> 56:27.608
These people who move
tons of this shit.

56:27.775 --> 56:31.650
They're not gifted people, Jared.
This is not rocket science.

56:32.192 --> 56:35.692
- And I'm not a drug dealer.
- No. You are not a drug dealer.

56:36.108 --> 56:37.900
You're a 29-year-old dive bum.

56:38.942 --> 56:40.483
You are.

56:40.650 --> 56:43.817
I'm serious, man. What's so funny?
You live in a trailer.

56:44.192 --> 56:46.358
You got a boat on blocks.

56:46.525 --> 56:49.817
Okay? And you got 50 bucks
to your name on a good day.

56:49.983 --> 56:52.442
I mean, come on. Well, Sam... Sam.

56:52.608 --> 56:56.025
How long you think a girl like Sam
will stick around if you don't fix that?

56:56.192 --> 56:58.150
- Sam is not like that.
- They're all like that.

56:58.358 --> 57:00.275
- Sam isn't.
- Okay.

57:00.442 --> 57:01.608
Look, I love you to death.

57:01.775 --> 57:04.275
The whole flip-flop-and-board-short
thing is cute now...

57:04.442 --> 57:07.233
...but what about when you're
the old man sitting at the bar...

57:07.400 --> 57:09.400
...and nothing in your pocket
but sand...

57:09.567 --> 57:12.567
...and you're drooling and you're
going on and on about how you...

57:12.733 --> 57:14.817
You were the one
who found the Zephyr.

57:14.983 --> 57:18.400
It was you until Bates came along...

57:18.567 --> 57:23.150
...and he stole that shit right from
under you. You gonna be that guy?

57:25.733 --> 57:27.067
You know what, Jared? Winners.

57:27.233 --> 57:30.942
Winners make the rules,
and losers live by them.

57:32.233 --> 57:34.358
What are we talk...?
It's a one-time thing, man.

57:34.525 --> 57:38.900
It's a one-time thing.
Means to an end.

57:39.067 --> 57:40.817
That's all it is.

57:48.525 --> 57:50.317
Where are you going?

57:50.858 --> 57:53.608
What, the conversation's
done now, Jared?

57:56.067 --> 57:57.692
Jared?

58:07.192 --> 58:08.400
He didn't go for it.

58:11.525 --> 58:14.025
You wanna keep tricking
or you wanna start pimping?

58:19.317 --> 58:21.025
I think it matters.

58:21.192 --> 58:22.900
What matters?

58:23.067 --> 58:24.525
The legend.

58:24.692 --> 58:27.233
About the pirate and the girl.

58:28.858 --> 58:31.942
I think it matters that he gave up
the treasure for love.

58:33.275 --> 58:36.108
- You do?
- Sure.

58:36.275 --> 58:38.692
Don't let Bryce hear you say that.

58:39.858 --> 58:41.775
What about you?

58:42.358 --> 58:45.442
Would you give up treasure
for love?

58:52.275 --> 58:53.983
Like it's even a question.

58:58.567 --> 59:01.900
- I'd definitely take the treasure.
- You're an ass. You would.

59:02.067 --> 59:04.650
- No way. No way.
- Yes, you would.

59:05.025 --> 59:07.650
We have a good life. A great one.

59:08.525 --> 59:11.108
You should ask yourself
what's missing in your life...

59:11.275 --> 59:13.400
...that money will get you.

59:30.692 --> 59:32.608
All right, hit it.

59:48.233 --> 59:51.483
- We good?
- Hold on. Hold on. Now.

01:00:49.483 --> 01:00:50.983
Hey, guys.

01:00:51.358 --> 01:00:52.858
How's it going?

01:00:54.275 --> 01:00:57.525
Like shit.
What you gonna do about it?

01:00:57.983 --> 01:01:00.567
I have a feeling I'm gonna
make it all better, baby.

01:01:00.733 --> 01:01:04.692
Winning. Winning. What's that, bro?

01:01:05.775 --> 01:01:07.317
What you gonna do?

01:01:07.483 --> 01:01:09.650
What'd you do if I sock you
in your face, homeboy?

01:01:09.858 --> 01:01:11.817
What if I sock you...?
What if I sock you in...?

01:01:12.025 --> 01:01:14.317
What if I sock you
right in your head?

01:01:15.442 --> 01:01:18.567
Yeah. No, no.
We're good, right? It's all good?

01:01:18.733 --> 01:01:20.483
What's that?
You want the one-two-three?

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:22.983
One-two-three?
What are you gonna do, bro?

01:01:27.525 --> 01:01:29.900
Get out of the car, Opie.

01:01:34.025 --> 01:01:35.525
What?

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.275
- I gotta go, man.
- You gotta go?

01:01:38.442 --> 01:01:41.192
I gotta go to work. My baby mama
harassing me for a new weave.

01:01:41.358 --> 01:01:42.525
All right, see you, Danny.

01:01:42.692 --> 01:01:44.983
- I'll see you later, all right?
- Yeah.

01:02:02.608 --> 01:02:05.650
- Yeah?
- Hey. What's up, bro? It's me.

01:02:05.858 --> 01:02:07.067
Hey, what's going on?

01:02:07.233 --> 01:02:10.192
- Can you meet me somewhere now?
- Yeah, where at?

01:02:22.192 --> 01:02:23.275
Now, stop that.

01:02:29.317 --> 01:02:30.817
Hey, what's up?

01:02:47.692 --> 01:02:49.025
This him?

01:02:49.192 --> 01:02:51.067
Yeah. He's a local. I know him.

01:02:52.567 --> 01:02:53.942
He's okay.

01:02:54.817 --> 01:02:57.233
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

01:03:03.942 --> 01:03:06.817
Here's the deal. Don't give me
that look. Everything's fine.

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:09.358
It's fine. It's fine.
These guys... Everything's cool.

01:03:09.525 --> 01:03:11.442
They thought I was Babylon,
I'm clearly not.

01:03:11.608 --> 01:03:13.858
So everything's good now,
right, brothers? Right?

01:03:14.025 --> 01:03:15.817
Come on. Hey, come on.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.067
Mr. Nobody, from nowhere,
tried to crash my party...

01:03:19.233 --> 01:03:21.192
...without an invitation.

01:03:21.608 --> 01:03:24.900
I need someone to vouch for him
before we nail his coffin shut.

01:03:27.358 --> 01:03:28.733
You found my plane, didn't you?

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:32.025
Okay, now, you see that?
Look, let... Do we have a deal or not?

01:03:32.192 --> 01:03:33.733
Because I mean, it's...

01:03:34.192 --> 01:03:35.650
No, we don't.

01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:40.192
So what's...? I mean, F you.
Is there a problem?

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:41.692
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah.

01:03:41.858 --> 01:03:46.358
You sound like you work in retail.
Yes, there is a problem.

01:03:55.358 --> 01:03:59.400
It takes balls, stealing my cocaine
and trying to sell it back to me.

01:03:59.567 --> 01:04:01.858
Your cocaine. Okay.
That's something we didn't know.

01:04:02.025 --> 01:04:03.983
- Now, listen up. Listen up.
- I swear on my...

01:04:04.692 --> 01:04:07.525
I don't care how my stuff
found its way back to me.

01:04:07.692 --> 01:04:10.483
I just want it back. All of it.

01:04:13.025 --> 01:04:16.858
- That is all of it.
- No, this stuff don't come in six-packs.

01:04:17.025 --> 01:04:19.108
Well, that's all we found.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.525
That's all we found.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.483
There is 800 kilos in that plane...

01:04:34.692 --> 01:04:37.567
...and I want every brick of it
in 12 hours' time.

01:04:39.525 --> 01:04:42.900
Primo tells me the ocean
is your soccer field.

01:04:44.108 --> 01:04:46.608
Me, I never leave this boat.

01:04:47.733 --> 01:04:50.108
So this is how it's gonna be.

01:04:50.942 --> 01:04:54.483
You are gonna swim back down
to the octopus's garden...

01:04:54.692 --> 01:04:58.733
...get the rest of it and bring it to me.
Then we'll talk numbers.

01:04:59.108 --> 01:05:02.692
There's a lot of boats buzzing around
out there, looking for my plane.

01:05:02.858 --> 01:05:06.525
If you get caught
and you give them my name...

01:05:07.442 --> 01:05:09.483
...l'm gonna come after those
you love most.

01:05:13.942 --> 01:05:15.483
Okay?

01:05:18.608 --> 01:05:19.900
No, it's not okay.

01:05:24.692 --> 01:05:26.150
Did you say something?

01:05:27.317 --> 01:05:29.983
We don't have the equipment
we need to haul the rest up...

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:31.775
...and it's gonna cost...

01:05:32.483 --> 01:05:35.858
...30,000, nonrefundable,
to get the rest of it.

01:05:40.567 --> 01:05:42.025
Give him the money.

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:54.567
You have 12 hours.

01:05:56.358 --> 01:05:58.317
Spend it wisely.

01:06:18.108 --> 01:06:20.692
- That was intense.
- Hey, hey.

01:06:20.858 --> 01:06:22.400
Hey. Okay.

01:06:22.567 --> 01:06:26.025
- I can't believe you.
- Okay. All right.

01:06:27.358 --> 01:06:29.483
You put everyone's life in jeopardy.

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:31.483
What's wrong with you?

01:06:32.025 --> 01:06:34.817
I don't understand. I don't
understand what the problem is.

01:06:34.983 --> 01:06:37.358
We go down there,
we go down in that wreck...

01:06:37.525 --> 01:06:39.942
...we bring up some coke,
we deal with these morons...

01:06:40.108 --> 01:06:42.733
...and then in a month
we're on the Discovery Channel...

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:45.483
...up to our knees in treasure,
smiling, like this.

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:47.692
What's the problem?

01:06:52.192 --> 01:06:54.192
It better be that simple.

01:06:55.192 --> 01:06:57.817
And if anything happens to Sam,
I swear I'm gonna kill you.

01:07:02.192 --> 01:07:03.858
Come on.

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:10.525
Sam, it's all good. This helps.
This is not a problem.

01:07:10.692 --> 01:07:12.442
Jared hooked it up. It's all good.

01:07:12.608 --> 01:07:16.525
I told you she wouldn't be into it.
She's so clean, she squeaks.

01:07:16.692 --> 01:07:18.733
- Shut up, you coke whore.
- Sam.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.317
- Very nice.
- Amanda, stop. All right?

01:07:21.483 --> 01:07:25.150
- We're all in this together now, right?
- Not me. Not anymore.

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.983
- Bye.
- Sam.

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:29.775
Hey, Sam.

01:07:30.817 --> 01:07:32.733
- Sam.
- See you on the 10:00 news.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.817
- What?
- You heard me.

01:07:34.983 --> 01:07:37.817
- Sam, come on, what are you doing?
- What is wrong with you?

01:07:37.983 --> 01:07:40.733
A week ago you had too much integrity
to work for Scuba Bob...

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.192
...and now you're working
for frigging drug dealers?

01:07:44.067 --> 01:07:45.567
Yeah, but...

01:07:46.108 --> 01:07:50.775
I believe in you more than
in the prospect of any treasure.

01:07:52.358 --> 01:07:56.775
If we do this just this one time...

01:07:57.192 --> 01:08:01.067
...we salvage the Zephyr
and it's over. That's it.

01:08:04.067 --> 01:08:06.317
It's already over.

01:08:09.317 --> 01:08:11.567
Oh, come on,
what are you talking about?

01:08:12.358 --> 01:08:14.150
Sam, come on.

01:08:23.692 --> 01:08:25.692
Sam, come on.

01:08:35.067 --> 01:08:38.358
- Yeah, you ready, Bryce?
- All right, hit it, Jared.

01:08:52.192 --> 01:08:54.817
Turn it off. Turn it...

01:08:56.942 --> 01:08:58.233
Hey, Bryce, you okay?

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:02.067
Let me get the sand out of my ass
and I'll tell you exactly how I am.

01:09:03.192 --> 01:09:04.899
You see anything?

01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:06.858
Bryce, you hear me?

01:09:07.024 --> 01:09:08.983
I see something.

01:09:09.358 --> 01:09:12.149
Keep it going, keep it going,
keep it going. Yes, yes, yes.

01:09:12.358 --> 01:09:13.899
Keep it going.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.233
Bingo, baby.

01:09:21.733 --> 01:09:24.067
Cut it, cut it, cut it.

01:09:24.233 --> 01:09:25.899
Bryce, how are we doing?

01:09:26.067 --> 01:09:27.817
Come down, come down.

01:09:36.817 --> 01:09:39.024
Baby, here we come.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:42.358
Yes, yes.

01:09:42.524 --> 01:09:45.649
Oh, my God, look at this.

01:09:45.858 --> 01:09:49.149
Let's go find the gold,
the G-old.

01:09:56.108 --> 01:09:58.400
Blow, baby, blow.

01:10:02.775 --> 01:10:04.067
All right, now suck.

01:10:22.275 --> 01:10:24.650
- Hey, over here.
- What? What is it?

01:10:24.817 --> 01:10:27.275
You got gold? What?

01:10:35.442 --> 01:10:36.650
Hell, no.

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:40.817
What's that say? What's that say?
Read that shit, bitch.

01:10:40.983 --> 01:10:43.483
Look at that. What's that say?

01:10:44.525 --> 01:10:48.817
Zephyr. Zephyr. Zephyr.

01:10:49.025 --> 01:10:51.358
That's what we need,
the name on something, right?

01:10:52.608 --> 01:10:55.275
That's it right there, baby,
that's the claim and the fame.

01:10:55.442 --> 01:10:57.192
Now let's go find the gold
and get paid.

01:10:57.525 --> 01:11:01.650
Where's the cheddar? The golden
cheddar? The old-gay eddar-chay?

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.358
Jared, where are you going? We need
to find the cheddar cheese, the gold.

01:11:22.233 --> 01:11:24.317
Amanda, come here, come here.

01:11:24.525 --> 01:11:27.692
Look at... Look at the P. Diddy juice.

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.983
1853. Good year.

01:11:31.192 --> 01:11:32.900
Keep it crispy. Pop the top.

01:11:34.567 --> 01:11:37.275
I can't take this mask off.

01:11:37.442 --> 01:11:40.733
- Let's go upstairs. Come on.
- Whatever.

01:11:42.442 --> 01:11:44.733
Would you give up treasure
for love?

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.358
Would you give up treasure
for love?

01:11:48.733 --> 01:11:51.067
I love you.

01:12:05.317 --> 01:12:06.983
Give me the bags.

01:12:09.442 --> 01:12:12.650
Hey. Hey, Chico, get the yeyo, man.

01:12:12.817 --> 01:12:15.817
I've never seen so much yeyo
in my life.

01:12:16.108 --> 01:12:18.650
Lots of cheese.
Look at all the cheese.

01:12:18.817 --> 01:12:20.317
Come on, let's just get this done.

01:12:22.025 --> 01:12:25.025
- Take it to the line.
- It's heavier than I thought it would be.

01:12:35.733 --> 01:12:38.192
All right, I need another bag.

01:12:44.775 --> 01:12:48.817
Listen, I'm gonna bring up this load
and the bell. Keep filling the bags.

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:34.317
Bryce, I need another one, come on.

01:13:38.608 --> 01:13:39.817
Here you go.

01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:19.275
Jesus Christ. Shit. Jared!

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.483
Hey, Bryce, come back.

01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:27.983
- Jared!
- Oh, no.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.525
What? What's wrong?

01:14:33.692 --> 01:14:37.983
- Jared. Jared, you gotta...
- Oh, no. Oh, no, what happened?

01:14:38.150 --> 01:14:39.817
Take off her BC.

01:14:42.692 --> 01:14:44.692
Help me out.
Get her on the boat.

01:14:52.233 --> 01:14:53.525
Turn her over.

01:14:53.692 --> 01:14:55.025
Oh, dear God.

01:14:55.192 --> 01:14:58.358
Oh, shit. We're getting
out of here, come on.

01:15:35.775 --> 01:15:37.733
Was she a certified diver?

01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:41.317
You know, I don't know.

01:15:41.525 --> 01:15:43.650
What about yourself?
Are you a certified diver?

01:15:43.817 --> 01:15:47.983
Look, ma'am... Ma'am, I'm a lawyer.

01:15:55.775 --> 01:15:57.025
I'm sorry.

01:15:57.567 --> 01:16:01.608
I'm just glad you're okay. I love you.

01:16:05.692 --> 01:16:07.442
We gotta get back down there
and get it.

01:16:07.608 --> 01:16:10.733
- It's down there, just waiting for us.
- Shut up, Bryce.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.358
Why don't you shut up, Sam.
Why don't you shut up, okay?

01:16:13.525 --> 01:16:15.317
- You put us through all this.
- Would you...?

01:16:15.483 --> 01:16:17.983
This wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for you. Get it?

01:16:18.192 --> 01:16:21.150
Yes, I got it. Great.
Now we're here, so let's go.

01:16:21.317 --> 01:16:23.858
The quicker we go down there
and get them off our backs...

01:16:24.025 --> 01:16:25.733
...the quicker we can get
our treasure.

01:16:26.275 --> 01:16:29.483
Amanda's dead, and you're
still thinking about treasure.

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:33.317
I've known her for five days.
Five days.

01:16:33.483 --> 01:16:34.900
You are such an asshole.

01:16:35.067 --> 01:16:38.608
Why am I an asshole?
What do you want me to do, Sam?

01:16:38.775 --> 01:16:41.692
You want me to wear an armband?
Go into mourning? Plan a funeral?

01:16:41.858 --> 01:16:44.900
I'm a terrible person. That's what it is.
I'm a terrible person, Sam.

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:46.650
- Yeah.
- You got it?

01:16:46.817 --> 01:16:48.483
- Who is it?
- You got the product?

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:51.775
- Wait, who is it?
- Man, we ran into some complications.

01:16:51.942 --> 01:16:54.025
- You got it or not?
- No.

01:16:55.442 --> 01:16:57.317
Then we have a problem,
Scuba-Doo.

01:16:57.608 --> 01:16:59.150
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.150
- He's got a gun.
- Go, go, go.

01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:06.442
Go, Jared. Watch those kids.

01:17:07.608 --> 01:17:09.233
Make a right, make a right.

01:17:14.192 --> 01:17:15.983
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

01:17:16.150 --> 01:17:19.650
- Come on, Jared. Jared.
- I'm going for it.

01:17:21.733 --> 01:17:24.025
- Jared.
- Oh, shit.

01:17:24.483 --> 01:17:25.483
Shit.

01:17:30.942 --> 01:17:34.150
- You okay?
- Jared? Jared?

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:36.400
- Jared, he's coming.
- Jared?

01:17:36.567 --> 01:17:39.317
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Jared, here he comes. Get in the car.

01:17:40.025 --> 01:17:41.983
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna take him out.

01:17:42.192 --> 01:17:45.233
- Jared?
- Yo, he's gonna hit the car. Back up.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.900
- Back up, man.
- I'm going, I'm going.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.608
- You'll hit my car. What you doing?
- Jesus' sake.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.983
I got it, I got it.

01:17:58.108 --> 01:17:59.400
Get him. The man move.

01:18:02.275 --> 01:18:03.692
Oh, man.

01:18:07.775 --> 01:18:10.317
- What are you doing?
- Go to Shoreline Cove. I'll meet you.

01:18:10.525 --> 01:18:11.817
- Jared...
- Sam, you drive.

01:18:11.983 --> 01:18:15.442
- No. Jar... It's not safe.
- Bro, don't be a hero. Be a coward.

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:18.150
- Be a coward, get in the car.
- Drive. I need you to drive.

01:18:18.358 --> 01:18:20.317
- Sam, get in the car.
- What are you gonna do?

01:18:20.525 --> 01:18:25.650
I'll meet up with you. Bryce, you drive.
I'll see you there. I'll be okay. Drive.

01:18:25.817 --> 01:18:29.650
No. No... Fuck.

01:18:35.692 --> 01:18:39.525
This boy a madman.
Him a madman here.

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:44.692
- Sam, where is this place?
- Right up here.

01:18:45.358 --> 01:18:46.817
All right, slow down.

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:51.192
Where you going?

01:18:51.358 --> 01:18:53.442
This is what we should've done
a long time ago.

01:18:59.608 --> 01:19:01.692
- Hey.
- Oh, what are you doing?

01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:05.525
What's going on? Where you been?
Where's Jared?

01:19:07.358 --> 01:19:09.942
- Can we talk for a minute?
- What's going on?

01:19:12.692 --> 01:19:16.358
Stupid. So stupid.

01:19:16.525 --> 01:19:19.317
Go. Just go. Just go.

01:19:20.233 --> 01:19:21.983
Sorry, Sam.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.650
- Here you go.
- What this?

01:19:49.858 --> 01:19:52.858
This is from a sunken ship
full of treasure.

01:19:53.025 --> 01:19:56.358
Easily won'th 10 times more
than your boss's coke.

01:19:56.525 --> 01:20:01.317
And you guys can have all of it,
if you forget you ever met us.

01:20:03.483 --> 01:20:05.358
Let's see if we can make a deal.

01:20:09.942 --> 01:20:11.358
This is serious, Sam.

01:20:12.358 --> 01:20:15.067
If I go to the wrong person
with this, right?

01:20:15.858 --> 01:20:18.983
I got the chief of police in my
back yard right now. We're coworkers.

01:20:19.150 --> 01:20:21.150
And I don't even know
if I can trust them.

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:27.192
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to drag you into this.

01:20:27.358 --> 01:20:31.692
I just... l... I didn't know
who else to go to.

01:20:33.108 --> 01:20:34.858
Let me make a call.

01:20:35.733 --> 01:20:38.483
I might know somebody
who may be able to help.

01:20:39.567 --> 01:20:41.025
Okay?

01:21:05.525 --> 01:21:07.108
Get down.

01:21:07.775 --> 01:21:09.358
Memo.

01:23:01.025 --> 01:23:03.358
Well, I see you've met
my business partner.

01:23:06.525 --> 01:23:09.317
You have something
that belongs to me, Jared?

01:23:31.525 --> 01:23:32.817
No, don't shoot.

01:23:38.692 --> 01:23:41.525
There he is. Use the solid.
Go get him.

01:24:43.858 --> 01:24:46.858
Man, this boy, he gotta be
around here somewhere.

01:24:54.233 --> 01:24:55.483
See him over there, mate?

01:25:25.567 --> 01:25:26.817
What it is, man.

01:25:34.983 --> 01:25:37.358
No sign of him yet, boss.
Brother's got skills.

01:25:37.525 --> 01:25:39.817
Forget about him.
Get back to the boat.

01:25:46.483 --> 01:25:48.317
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- What about Jared?

01:25:48.483 --> 01:25:54.275
Oh, Jared, he'll be okay.
Trust me, Reyes is done. Over.

01:25:54.442 --> 01:25:56.483
He won't be a problem anymore
for anyone.

01:25:56.692 --> 01:25:58.400
Thank you, Roy.

01:25:58.567 --> 01:26:01.317
You don't have to thank me, Sam.
This is the guy right here.

01:26:05.233 --> 01:26:06.983
Bates?

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.608
Hey, Bryce.

01:26:25.983 --> 01:26:28.108
- Where's Sam?
- What the hell happened to you?

01:26:28.275 --> 01:26:31.442
- The hell with that. Where's Sam at?
- She went to... To the cops, bro.

01:26:31.608 --> 01:26:35.025
She went to Roy. I couldn't stop her.
She just jumped right out of the car.

01:26:35.192 --> 01:26:37.400
- Give me your phone.
- Why? What's up?

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:39.650
- I'm gonna call Sam.
- What's going on?

01:26:39.858 --> 01:26:41.525
Reyes and Primo are dead.

01:26:41.692 --> 01:26:43.317
Bates killed them.

01:26:43.525 --> 01:26:45.483
What do you mean,
Bates killed them?

01:26:45.692 --> 01:26:47.150
Reyes and Bates were partners.

01:26:47.358 --> 01:26:50.733
We found their lost coke, and Reyes
tried to cut Bates out of the deal.

01:26:51.525 --> 01:26:54.150
So Bates doesn't look
for treasure, really.

01:26:54.358 --> 01:26:57.650
No, he's been looking for his plane,
been moving drugs this whole time.

01:27:03.692 --> 01:27:06.317
- Hello.
- Hey, who's this?

01:27:06.483 --> 01:27:09.358
Jared. Hi. Listen,
I just wanted to say...

01:27:09.525 --> 01:27:12.400
... that I am really, really sorry
about all this.

01:27:12.567 --> 01:27:15.150
Your girlfriend says she doesn't
know where my plane is.

01:27:15.317 --> 01:27:17.525
Either she's a good liar
or she likes pain.

01:27:17.692 --> 01:27:20.358
Not sure. You know her better
than I do. What do you think?

01:27:20.733 --> 01:27:22.817
Hey, Derek, why don't you
just let her go.

01:27:23.608 --> 01:27:26.358
Well, you tell me where my plane is
and she walks.

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.317
- Let me talk to her for a minute.
- I would.

01:27:29.483 --> 01:27:34.817
I would let you talk to her right now,
but she's got this thing in her mouth.

01:27:37.025 --> 01:27:39.150
Look, you want me to show you
where your coke is?

01:27:39.358 --> 01:27:43.567
No, no, no. Not show, Jared. Tell.

01:27:43.817 --> 01:27:47.150
You give me the coordinates right now
and Sam walks off this boat.

01:27:47.317 --> 01:27:49.192
No, I'm gonna tell you
how it's gonna go.

01:27:49.358 --> 01:27:50.775
This isn't a partnership, Jared.

01:27:50.942 --> 01:27:53.192
No, that's exactly what this is.
Fifty-fifty.

01:27:53.358 --> 01:27:57.900
If you want your coke, meet me
three klicks due south of Easter Point.

01:27:58.067 --> 01:28:01.317
All right. I will see you there.

01:28:01.525 --> 01:28:02.692
Oh, and Jared...

01:28:03.275 --> 01:28:06.817
... you saw what happened to the
last partner who tried to screw me.

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:17.692
Remember when I said if anything
happened to Sam, I'd kill you?

01:28:17.858 --> 01:28:20.358
Oh, don't do that.
Don't hit me with the fucking chair.

01:28:29.650 --> 01:28:32.608
You told me this would be easy.
This would be a one-time thing.

01:28:32.775 --> 01:28:36.483
Yeah. Okay, it didn't go the way
I planned it. All right? It went wrong.

01:28:36.692 --> 01:28:38.150
Yeah, this was all wrong.

01:28:41.025 --> 01:28:44.192
If I didn't have such a sweet tooth...

01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:52.275
...I would kill you. Right now.

01:28:52.442 --> 01:28:54.108
Bates.

01:28:56.275 --> 01:28:57.900
Yes, Roy?

01:29:02.025 --> 01:29:04.900
- What?
- You got what you wanted, right?

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:09.150
She's had enough.

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.525
I see.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.483
You're the one
who was right on top of it...

01:29:15.692 --> 01:29:17.775
...when you stopped them
the other day, right?

01:29:17.942 --> 01:29:20.067
And you're the one
that didn't log the location.

01:29:20.233 --> 01:29:24.483
- Was that you?
- I told you it didn't merit the attention.

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:26.567
I believe them.

01:29:26.858 --> 01:29:28.483
They're friends of mine.

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:39.483
They are friends of mine too.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.483
I'm not the one who put the gun
to your head.

01:29:47.692 --> 01:29:51.192
Did I make you settle with those guys
for that extra cash? Did I do that?

01:29:51.358 --> 01:29:54.442
Oh, no, you did. You were there,
Jared, too, just like me.

01:29:54.608 --> 01:29:58.400
Your eyes were spinning.
Gold bars. Same as mine. No?

01:30:02.525 --> 01:30:04.608
I'm sorry, Jared.

01:30:06.108 --> 01:30:08.025
I screwed up.

01:30:10.317 --> 01:30:12.442
Man, I screwed up.

01:30:13.525 --> 01:30:15.483
I was the one that screwed up.

01:30:20.192 --> 01:30:22.567
Bates know I'm still here?

01:30:36.608 --> 01:30:37.817
Hey, Danny, we need a favor.

01:30:38.025 --> 01:30:41.025
Jared? Bryce?
What are y'all doing here?

01:30:41.192 --> 01:30:43.525
- Come on, help me tie on.
- Oh, yeah, man, no problem.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.525
There he comes.

01:31:05.317 --> 01:31:07.150
Sam!

01:31:08.358 --> 01:31:11.025
All right. She's job security.

01:31:11.358 --> 01:31:14.192
Now, if you want her to live,
you take me to my plane...

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.317
...you dive with us.
It'll be like old times.

01:31:17.483 --> 01:31:19.525
Let her go and I'll sweeten the deal.

01:31:19.692 --> 01:31:24.858
Sweet...? With what? That shipwreck
in your back yard? What, your dog?

01:31:25.025 --> 01:31:26.942
You have nothing to give me, Jared.

01:31:27.108 --> 01:31:29.025
- I found the Zephyr.
- What?

01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:31.192
And I'll let you have the claim.

01:31:31.358 --> 01:31:33.983
I brought you here to save her life,
not to get her killed.

01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:36.400
- Hundreds of millions...
- The Zephyr doesn't exist.

01:31:36.567 --> 01:31:39.483
...it's all yours, if you want.
If you let Sam go. It does exist.

01:31:39.650 --> 01:31:41.233
- It's not a myth.
- It's not a myth?

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.192
- You want it? Then let her go.
- Okay.

01:31:43.358 --> 01:31:46.025
Then let her go right now.
Sam, let's go. We're out of here.

01:31:46.192 --> 01:31:47.483
- Go.
- Let her go.

01:31:47.692 --> 01:31:50.233
Sam, he gave up the gold
and they got away.

01:31:52.692 --> 01:31:54.442
He found the Zephyr.

01:31:55.150 --> 01:31:58.858
Maybe we'll meet up
in Never-Never Land...

01:31:59.025 --> 01:32:02.233
...because I heard the tooth fairy
was gonna be there.

01:32:03.108 --> 01:32:07.025
Santa Claus is coming, you know,
with my coke.

01:32:24.275 --> 01:32:26.317
So how long you been
a drug trafficker?

01:32:26.608 --> 01:32:29.317
I'm a salvor, Jared,
the same as I've always been.

01:32:29.483 --> 01:32:31.608
But investors don't like it
when you come back...

01:32:31.775 --> 01:32:34.483
...to shore with nothing
but empty fuel tanks and a sunburn.

01:32:35.192 --> 01:32:37.692
- All right, is this it?
- Throttle down.

01:32:38.483 --> 01:32:40.192
Throttle down.

01:32:40.942 --> 01:32:44.567
Why did you have to put me
in this situation, Jared?

01:32:45.525 --> 01:32:48.775
I mean, what am I supposed to do
with you and Sam now?

01:32:48.942 --> 01:32:50.817
Pay us a finder's fee.

01:32:50.983 --> 01:32:54.067
Yeah, see, now you sound like
a man who has a future.

01:32:55.358 --> 01:32:58.567
The way I see it, Bates, you're the one
whose days are numbered.

01:32:59.233 --> 01:33:02.483
You got this big ship and crew,
all this fancy gear...

01:33:02.650 --> 01:33:05.275
...and you couldn't even find
your own plane.

01:33:05.650 --> 01:33:06.650
That must suck.

01:33:29.858 --> 01:33:32.400
Hey, captain,
there's something up ahead.

01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:35.608
Do you see it?
Right up there, 2 o'clock.

01:33:36.733 --> 01:33:38.733
Raolo, slow down, man.

01:33:44.025 --> 01:33:45.817
Right here, captain.

01:33:47.858 --> 01:33:50.150
Now who's the treasure finder?

01:33:50.692 --> 01:33:53.775
- What the hell is this, Jared?
- That's half your coke, captain.

01:33:53.942 --> 01:33:56.108
Now I'm gonna go down
and destroy the rest of it.
