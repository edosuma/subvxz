- You here to try and cheer me up?
- No, you still have our insulin.

09:55.999 --> 09:59.166
We're all on the edge
of diabetic shock.

09:59.168 --> 10:01.168
I was just trying
to be a great counselor,

10:01.170 --> 10:05.006
and you all hate me.
I'm not fit to wear this shirt.

10:05.008 --> 10:09.377
[grunting]

10:09.379 --> 10:12.213
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

10:12.215 --> 10:14.315
- We don't hate you.
- Really?

10:14.317 --> 10:17.318
Being a great counselor isn't
about locking us in a cabin.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.986
If we wanted to be smothered,

10:18.988 --> 10:21.155
we could have stayed at home
with our parents.

10:21.157 --> 10:23.624
You got to relax.
Let us have some fun.

10:24.827 --> 10:26.928
You're right. 
I thought being the world's

10:26.929 --> 10:29.030
best counselor meant keeping you safe,

10:29.032 --> 10:31.332
but it really means giving you
the best summer ever,

10:31.334 --> 10:35.036
even if it means a little danger.
Let's go have some fun!

10:35.038 --> 10:36.504
[all cheering]

10:36.506 --> 10:38.672
Wait!
You forgot your sunscreen.

10:38.674 --> 10:41.742
No, Steve. Let it go.

10:43.846 --> 10:47.048
Oh, God! I'm burning!

10:47.050 --> 10:49.817
I'm burning!

10:49.819 --> 10:51.519
You smell delicious.

10:51.521 --> 10:54.055
[all chomping]

10:54.056 --> 10:56.787
[music]

10:59.829 --> 11:02.063

11:02.065 --> 11:06.789
Yes! Burn, 
normal-size people! Burn!

11:07.537 --> 11:10.071
<i>[Woody] Listen, dickhead,
you don't tell me what to do.</i>

11:10.073 --> 11:13.007
We are not going to jail again
because of you.

11:13.009 --> 11:14.909
Don't give me that look, now.

11:14.911 --> 11:17.845
Aw, I can't stay mad at you.

11:17.847 --> 11:19.580
You want to kiss and make up?

11:19.582 --> 11:21.215
[chuckles]
Come here.

11:21.217 --> 11:23.851
Aah!
It's a white walker!

11:23.853 --> 11:28.022
<i>[Denzel] Okay, let me
tell y'all a ghost story.</i>

11:28.024 --> 11:30.191
Legend has it
that right over that hill

11:30.193 --> 11:32.960
is a cursed Native American
burial ground.

11:32.962 --> 11:35.029
And any dead thing
that's buried there

11:35.031 --> 11:39.233
- comes back to life!
- I hate true ghost stories.

11:39.235 --> 11:42.069
But the ground is sour.

11:42.071 --> 11:45.806
And when the dead come
back, they ain't the same.

11:45.808 --> 11:48.142
They eat mother[bleep] brains!

11:48.144 --> 11:49.310
<i>[all] Boo!</i>

11:52.982 --> 11:54.248
Listen up, Muskogees.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.983
Chief Woody says
the winner of this event

11:55.985 --> 11:59.487
- gets 50 tribal shield points!
- Yeah, sure, whatever.

11:59.489 --> 12:01.322
This will be
the most goddamn important

12:01.324 --> 12:03.157
potato-sack race of your lives!

12:03.159 --> 12:05.659
I don't have a partner.

12:05.661 --> 12:09.163
Chief Woody would love
to be your partner.

12:09.165 --> 12:12.399
Yeah, come hop
in the sack with me.

12:12.401 --> 12:16.070
It's tight inside, but it's warm.

12:16.072 --> 12:18.672
T-T-T-Tight?
W-W-W-Warm?

12:18.674 --> 12:21.642
- Points!
- Aah!

12:23.980 --> 12:25.813
Down boy!
Down boy!

12:25.815 --> 12:27.815
Ooh! Whoa!

12:27.817 --> 12:30.651
- Not so big now, are you?
- Hello, Woody.

12:30.653 --> 12:33.320
Tiffany, shouldn't you be
with the other campers?

12:33.322 --> 12:35.156
There's something
between us, Woody.

12:35.158 --> 12:38.025
- Don't you feel it?
- That's my raging frozen penis.

12:38.027 --> 12:40.828
I mean I didn't notice.
Besides, you're just a kid.

12:40.830 --> 12:44.865
Not for much longer.
I turn 18 in two days.

12:44.867 --> 12:48.769
- You do?
- Think you can last till then?

12:51.007 --> 12:52.606
[Ethel] Woody, we have a problem.

12:52.608 --> 12:55.009
I know. We blew through
our liquid-nitrogen budget.

12:55.011 --> 12:57.845
- The campers hate it here.
- My kids are having fun.

12:57.847 --> 12:59.480
Now, see?
Now, why can't your kids

12:59.482 --> 13:01.649
be more like Steve's
four happy "queerdos"?

13:01.651 --> 13:03.350
The rest of the kids are saying
that they want to go home.

13:03.352 --> 13:05.319
No one is going home!

13:05.321 --> 13:07.888
I'm not giving any goddamn refunds.

13:10.993 --> 13:14.361
Hello, Mom?
This place sucks nuts.

13:14.363 --> 13:16.397
[high-pitched voice] Which is
a good thing because I'm gay.

13:16.399 --> 13:18.832
<i>[woman]
What? You're dead to me!</i>

13:18.834 --> 13:20.334
[grunts]

13:20.336 --> 13:22.503
Kids, don't make me take away points

13:22.505 --> 13:25.206
on the tribal shield
'cause of low morale.

13:25.208 --> 13:26.674
There's nothing in here...

13:26.676 --> 13:29.343
just all these drawings
of hairy footballs!

13:29.345 --> 13:32.346
- Malloy!
- Ain't I a stinker?

13:32.348 --> 13:34.481
The point system is bullshit.

13:34.483 --> 13:37.151
This is no fun.
 We want to go home.

13:37.153 --> 13:40.321
All right. All right!
You kids want fun?

13:40.323 --> 13:42.356
Let's have some goddamn fun!

13:42.358 --> 13:46.160
Tomorrow we are going to
unretire an old camp tradition...

13:46.162 --> 13:48.162
a little blood-and-guts
obstacle course

13:48.164 --> 13:52.833
that we like to call... the Gauntlet.

13:52.835 --> 13:55.369
- Woody, no!
- Shut up, Steve!

13:55.371 --> 13:58.072
<i>It's the most treacherous
obstacle course known to man.</i>

13:58.074 --> 14:00.341
[roaring]

14:00.343 --> 14:01.742
And since my points system

14:01.744 --> 14:04.178
has been revealed
as complete bullshit,

14:04.180 --> 14:08.082
the winner of the Gauntlet will
be awarded the tribal shield!

14:08.084 --> 14:10.417
[all cheering]

14:10.419 --> 14:12.519
I want that shield, do you hear me?

14:12.521 --> 14:16.090
Yeah! We can't wait to
compete in the Gauntlet.

14:16.092 --> 14:18.292
No way.
You four won't be competing.

14:18.294 --> 14:21.629
- It's too dangerous.
- We deserve a chance to win.

14:21.631 --> 14:24.298
We're gonna do it
whether you like it or not.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.467
Well, you can't compete
if you don't have a counselor.

14:26.469 --> 14:28.969
And guess what. I quit.

14:28.971 --> 14:31.872
You are the worst counselor ever.

14:31.874 --> 14:35.275
Watch me poop!

Hey, man, what gives?

14:56.968 --> 14:59.135
You were just blowing up
my spot back there.

14:59.137 --> 15:01.304
I don't understand what
the [bleep] you just said,

15:01.306 --> 15:04.573
but listen and listen good.
Tiffany is my piece.

15:04.575 --> 15:06.475
Then why is she going to
the camp dance with me?

15:06.477 --> 15:08.144
Find a girl your own age.

15:08.146 --> 15:09.979
Got to be a graveyard
somewhere nearby.

15:11.082 --> 15:12.982
Are you gonna kill him?

15:12.984 --> 15:15.818
No, I'm not giving that little
bastard's parents a refund.

15:15.820 --> 15:18.854
Well, the one thing Chad
does have is youth.

15:18.856 --> 15:20.690
If you want to impress Tiffany
at tonight's dance,

15:20.692 --> 15:23.159
you need to learn how to act younger.

15:23.161 --> 15:24.994
Well, how the hell do I do that?

15:24.996 --> 15:28.564
Trust me, I know what the
kids are into these days.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.372
Malloy, are you sure about this?

15:36.374 --> 15:38.808
Just relax.
I'll tell you what to say.

15:38.810 --> 15:41.644
- Woody?
- Tiffany, uh...

15:41.646 --> 15:44.013
You looking cray cray like
a noob says no one ever come

- Whoa.

gave a senior discount.

their feet, not their fists.

Challenge him to a dance-off!
Tell him this...

Oh, hiya, Chad.
What's a child like you doing

16:15.796 --> 16:17.246
out of your cabin at this hour?

16:17.248 --> 16:20.309
Where's Tiffany?
I wrote her a song for her birthday.

16:20.344 --> 16:23.652
Not happening, but I know someone
else who'd love to hear it.

16:23.654 --> 16:26.489
Ma? Dad?
What are you doing here?

16:26.491 --> 16:28.157
You're in big trouble, young man.

16:28.159 --> 16:30.993
- Mr. Johnson told us what you did.
- What did I do?

16:30.995 --> 16:33.829
No son of mine
is gonna jack off a raccoon

16:33.831 --> 16:36.399
unless I get to watch
with a hairbrush up my ass.

16:36.401 --> 16:37.833
Right, honey?

16:37.835 --> 16:39.335

16:39.337 --> 16:42.218
Well, ain't you gonna open
your present?

16:42.573 --> 16:44.673
Why did you get me a cane?

16:44.675 --> 16:48.043
Because after tonight, you are
going to be walking funny.

We're getting ready
for the Gauntlet.

17:04.362 --> 17:05.961
How?
 You don't have a counselor.

17:05.963 --> 17:08.798
Yeah, we do.
Woody assigned us this guy.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.532
F-First lesson.

17:10.535 --> 17:13.368
F-F-Fire can't hurt
you when you're...

17:13.371 --> 17:17.705
- when you're drunk.
- Are you nuts?

17:17.708 --> 17:19.909
You can't run the Gauntlet
with that drunken hobo.

17:19.911 --> 17:21.544
Sure, we might die.

17:21.546 --> 17:23.813
But that's better than
giving up like you did.

17:23.815 --> 17:26.882
- And who else would run with us?
- I will.

17:26.884 --> 17:29.318
I didn't realize winning
this thing meant so much to you.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.654
We've never won anything before.

17:31.656 --> 17:33.255
Well, it's not going to be easy.

17:33.257 --> 17:34.924
Look at those kids over there.

<i>[Steve] They're bigger,
faster, stronger, blacker.</i>

17:37.328 --> 17:38.594
Now look at yourselves...

an albino, a crazy
midget, a clubfoot gimp,

17:41.165 --> 17:42.665
and a Puerto Rican blind kid.

17:42.667 --> 17:45.134
What?
I'm a [bleep] Puerto Rican?

17:45.136 --> 17:46.969
My parents told me I was Japanese.

17:46.971 --> 17:50.353
Guys, we're going to go out
there and win tomorrow!

17:50.388 --> 17:53.309
Do you know why?
Because your legs, eyes, skin,

17:53.311 --> 17:55.411
and general appearance may be crippled.

17:55.413 --> 17:58.147
But you know what isn't?
Your hearts.

17:58.149 --> 18:00.349
Ho... Hobo Larry's
gonna show you

18:02.487 --> 18:05.488
and a...
and a fr... free breakfast.

18:07.158 --> 18:09.158
All right, kids, the only
rule of the Gauntlet is...

18:09.160 --> 18:12.161
no rules!
First team to grab the flag wins.

18:12.663 --> 18:14.997
On your mark, get set...

18:21.005 --> 18:22.671
We're never going to win.

18:22.673 --> 18:24.673
Not necessarily.
I know a shortcut.

18:24.675 --> 18:26.842
Hey, isn't that how
your campers got killed?

18:26.844 --> 18:29.512
Yes, but it's the perfect plan.

18:29.514 --> 18:33.716
It's time we use your
disabilities to our advantage!

18:37.321 --> 18:40.685
[explosion]
[music]

18:41.158 --> 18:42.725
We made it.

18:42.727 --> 18:45.327
No, that's just the entrance
to the shortcut.

18:45.329 --> 18:47.196
To the death cave!

- Still you.

Whoa!

18:56.874 --> 18:58.741
Ugh!

19:00.378 --> 19:02.678
Just wanted you to feel included.

19:02.680 --> 19:08.584
There's the finish line!
The tribal shield is as good as mi...

One, two, three, four.
No dead kids!

19:18.195 --> 19:19.695
I can't believe I'm saying this,

19:19.697 --> 19:22.197
but Steve's tribe is the winner!

19:22.199 --> 19:24.500
Is this a [bleep] trash can lid?

19:24.502 --> 19:27.336
Here you go, Steve.
You finally deserve this.

19:27.338 --> 19:29.171
You are the world's
best counselor.

19:29.173 --> 19:31.507
Wow. Thanks, guys.

19:31.509 --> 19:32.841
To be honest,
we all were pretty sure

19:32.843 --> 19:34.677
you'd find some way to kill us.

19:34.679 --> 19:37.880
I think this shrunk up a little.

Aah!

19:53.713 --> 19:55.980
You must feel terrible
for killing all those kids...

19:55.982 --> 19:58.315
- again.
- Actually, I feel fine.

19:58.317 --> 19:59.950
Last night I put their bodies

19:59.952 --> 20:02.653
in that Native American burial
ground that raises the dead.

20:02.655 --> 20:04.789
Steve, you dumbass,
that was just a ghost story.

20:04.791 --> 20:07.458
Oh, yeah?
Tell that to them.

20:07.460 --> 20:10.661
[all moaning]

20:10.663 --> 20:13.564
Oh, Garebear, I missed you!

20:13.566 --> 20:15.399
Oh, let's not bite.

20:15.401 --> 20:17.835
Sharon? Is that you?

20:17.837 --> 20:21.906
- Woody! So nice to see you.
- What are you doing here?

20:21.908 --> 20:23.474
I haven't seen you since we...

20:23.476 --> 20:27.078
Had unprotected sex 18 years
and 9 months ago to the day?

20:27.080 --> 20:29.413
Oh, I'm here picking up
my daughter Tiffany.

20:29.415 --> 20:31.215
- What?
- Oh, there she is now.

20:31.217 --> 20:35.386
Tiffany, sweetie.
Have you met Mr. Johnson?

20:35.388 --> 20:37.555
I sure have.

20:37.557 --> 20:40.057
Ow. Ow.

20:40.059 --> 20:41.559
<i>Ow.</i>

20:41.561 --> 20:44.061
I'm gonna kill you,
you son of a bitch!

20:44.063 --> 20:47.231
Aah!
Ooh!

20:47.233 --> 20:48.971
Aah!

20:50.981 --> 20:53.524
