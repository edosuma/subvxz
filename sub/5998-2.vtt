00:00.670 --> 00:03.776
Your buddy Jack Nesbitt...
he's into some nasty business.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.866
These guys traffic
Eastern European women

00:05.890 --> 00:06.590
against their will.

00:06.780 --> 00:07.896
They killed Katya.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.366
She gathered information
on the whole operation.

00:10.390 --> 00:11.996
What happened at the club

00:12.020 --> 00:14.506
when that guy
put his gun to my head...

00:14.530 --> 00:15.906
I've been spinning out.

00:15.930 --> 00:19.076
I don't ever want to let
you out of my life again.

00:19.100 --> 00:22.546
I'm pregnant.

00:22.570 --> 00:23.616
What's going on?

00:23.640 --> 00:25.216
Severide, we're stripping you
of your rank.

00:25.240 --> 00:26.047
What?

00:26.071 --> 00:28.316
Captain Patterson will
be taking over Squad 3,

00:28.340 --> 00:30.080
effective immediately.

01:11.050 --> 01:13.426
We're sticking to
the plan, right?

01:13.450 --> 01:16.460
Definitely.
We're not saying a thing.

01:24.430 --> 01:26.330
Hey, hey,
what can I do for you?

01:27.340 --> 01:30.540
So I... I know
this is all of a sudden,

01:31.440 --> 01:34.510
but I want to be
detailed to Arson.

01:39.450 --> 01:41.026
Lieutenant?

01:41.050 --> 01:44.296
I support the decision 100%.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.096
Severide already made a call
on my behalf,

01:46.120 --> 01:47.866
and there's
a spot open at OFI,

01:47.890 --> 01:49.436
and I need to jump on
it if I'm gonna get it.

01:49.460 --> 01:52.136
Why?

01:52.160 --> 01:53.436
You unhappy?

01:53.460 --> 01:54.706
No, no, Chief, no.

01:54.730 --> 01:56.806
I'm gonna hate
losing you off 81,

01:56.830 --> 01:59.730
after everything you did
to become a firefighter.

02:01.940 --> 02:04.200
I'm pregnant.

02:07.180 --> 02:10.086
Gabriela Dawson,
get your ass over here.

02:10.110 --> 02:12.826
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

02:12.850 --> 02:13.827
Congratulations...

02:13.851 --> 02:15.126
- Thanks.
- To both of you.

02:15.150 --> 02:18.066
I mean, that's the
greatest thing in the world.

02:18.090 --> 02:20.696
- Thanks, Chief.
- We're not going public yet.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.496
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.866
We thought we'd wait
at least six weeks.

02:24.890 --> 02:28.736
We're not telling anybody?

02:28.760 --> 02:30.200
Right.

02:32.700 --> 02:35.846
Hey! Look at that! Oh!

02:35.870 --> 02:37.416
Hey, remember, people,

02:37.440 --> 02:39.646
the outside world is
on a need-to-know basis.

02:39.670 --> 02:41.786
Not a word goes beyond
51, right, Lieutenant?

02:41.810 --> 02:42.886
Right.

02:42.910 --> 02:44.440
That goes
especially for you, Connie.

02:47.780 --> 02:49.996
Hey. Congratulations.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.496
Thank you.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.726
Oh, thanks for hooking
me up with Nick Duffy.

02:53.750 --> 02:54.836
He seemed great
on the phone.

02:54.860 --> 02:56.066
Yeah, Duffy's the best.

02:56.090 --> 02:59.760
He's like family,
just without the drama.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.416
There's no need to hide,
Lieutenant.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.046
We're just
an ordinary couple, for once.

03:12.070 --> 03:13.416
You're gonna do great.

03:13.440 --> 03:14.756
Keep your badge off the wall.

03:14.780 --> 03:16.580
I will.

03:33.090 --> 03:34.436
Hear me out.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.376
You and I are on
the same side.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.946
You got to believe that.

03:37.970 --> 03:39.976
We got in this thing
for the same reason...

03:40.000 --> 03:42.076
to put an end to it.

03:42.100 --> 03:44.816
- Why are you here?
- Katya's notebook.

03:44.840 --> 03:45.916
What about it?

03:45.940 --> 03:47.756
If we are gonna nail
these bastards,

03:47.780 --> 03:49.056
we gotta find it.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.556
Now, what exactly did she
say about where it was?

03:51.580 --> 03:52.950
I already told the cops.

03:53.050 --> 03:54.956
Oh, I know, but if there's
any detail you remember,

03:54.980 --> 03:58.580
even something about
the way she said it...

04:00.590 --> 04:01.836
I have everything
written down.

04:01.860 --> 04:05.430
- Let me see them.
- I don't have it with me.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.246
Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

04:11.270 --> 04:12.460
Vehicle accident.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.466
Hey, Capp,
go check out the front...

04:34.490 --> 04:36.366
My bad, Captain, how do
you want to work this?

04:36.390 --> 04:38.736
Severide, check the rear
of that truck for stability.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.406
Capp, Tony, struts,
front and rear.

04:40.430 --> 04:43.530
Cruz, chain that frame
to the Squad's tow hook.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.970
Hey, I got a guy in here,
looks critical.

04:51.970 --> 04:53.716
Got another guy
in the front.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.256
Mouch, short roof ladder.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.456
- Got it.
- Let's get him out.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.156
Okay,
what do we got?

04:58.180 --> 05:00.426
Got two victims, one in
the cab, one in the back.

05:00.450 --> 05:01.826
How long to get inside?

05:01.850 --> 05:02.856
Severide.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.626
Doors are reinforced.
Could take a minute.

05:04.650 --> 05:07.096
We may not have it, especially
if that railing fails.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.166
What about the other car?

05:08.190 --> 05:10.236
Herrmann,
get the roof off that car.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.790
- Take Jimmy with you.
- Okay.

05:26.210 --> 05:30.286
Help!
Get me out of here!

05:30.310 --> 05:32.526
Damn it.
Otis, get the K-12.

05:32.550 --> 05:34.280
Got it.

05:36.350 --> 05:39.520
Hey, uh, Chief?
We got company.

05:41.720 --> 05:45.566
Okay, people, step back
from the scene, please.

05:45.590 --> 05:47.376
Step back, please.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.130
Thank you.

06:06.890 --> 06:08.790
Help!

06:10.360 --> 06:13.266
Coming,
Casey!

06:13.290 --> 06:14.506
I'm sorry!

06:14.530 --> 06:16.076
It got away from me
before I could hook it in.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.560
- You got it?
- Yeah!

06:26.570 --> 06:28.156
You got this. You can do this.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.886
Come on. Come on.

06:29.910 --> 06:31.216
Don't let me go. Come on.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.280
Come on!

06:41.920 --> 06:43.860
Give me your arm. Give me your arm.

06:47.590 --> 06:50.400
Come on! Come on!

06:52.800 --> 06:55.070
Okay, great.
Come on, come on.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.616
Thanks.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.516
Capp, Tony,
lock those struts in.

07:04.540 --> 07:07.326
Halligans.

07:07.350 --> 07:10.056
It is locked in for now,
but it could go at any time.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.096
- Let's get him out.
- Get me out of here!

07:12.120 --> 07:13.320
Help!

07:26.130 --> 07:28.830
Ow, ow, my leg!

07:50.490 --> 07:53.160
All right, Capp, Cruz, give
Tony a hand with that door.

07:58.630 --> 08:00.370
Go, go.

08:04.340 --> 08:05.616
Hey, hey, hey,
you heard what he said.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.386
Stay back.
Stay back. Back.

08:08.410 --> 08:09.786
You don't own
this street, man.

08:09.810 --> 08:11.886
Hey, there a problem here?

08:11.910 --> 08:14.996
Hey, need a hand in here.
This guy's bleeding out.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.550
Go ahead.

08:25.990 --> 08:28.160
Hey!

08:30.860 --> 08:32.806
Stay down!

08:32.830 --> 08:34.746
Hey, don't even think about it.

08:34.770 --> 08:36.676
Hands!
Let's see your hands!

08:36.700 --> 08:39.946
Down on the ground.
Get down.

08:39.970 --> 08:41.370
Stay down.

08:43.340 --> 08:45.340
Here we go. Here we go.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.766
There we go.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.080
Up to your knees.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.370
Check out the floorboard.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.126
He was gonna
"Mad Max" this thing.

09:17.150 --> 09:20.520
Hey, you're kidding me, right?

09:22.950 --> 09:24.926
For the love of God,
will someone get over here

09:24.950 --> 09:27.190
and arrest this moron?

09:36.130 --> 09:38.146
- Dawson, yeah?
- Oh, Commander Duffy.

09:38.170 --> 09:39.176
Hey, it's great to meet you.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.276
Skip the Commander bit.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.286
- Duffy's fine.
- Okay.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.016
Severide told me
you were like an uncle.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.456
'Cause I taught him how to
throw a split-fingered fastball.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.387
His old man

09:47.411 --> 09:48.716
wanted him to run track.

09:48.740 --> 09:49.687
Can you imagine?

09:49.711 --> 09:51.016
I don't know
if he mentioned it,

09:51.040 --> 09:53.556
but we worked on an arson
case together last year.

09:53.580 --> 09:54.826
The victim
was a friend of ours.

09:54.850 --> 09:56.726
Paramedic, yeah.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.056
Yeah, I remember.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.396
He said you were
a natural.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.496
Well, I'm really grateful
to be here.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.536
Welcome aboard.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.606
Thanks.

10:05.630 --> 10:09.806
My one pearl of wisdom
for newbies: Pace yourself.

10:09.830 --> 10:11.976
We're not running into
burning buildings here.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.370
It's a game of patience.

10:17.340 --> 10:18.546
Hey, neighbor.

10:18.570 --> 10:20.416
I hear congratulations
are in order.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.386
Oh, thanks, yeah,
it's great to be here.

10:22.410 --> 10:26.086
No, your baby.

10:26.110 --> 10:27.186
How'd you hear?

10:27.210 --> 10:28.187
Oh, I just got off with Connie.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.426
We do SoulCycle together.

10:29.450 --> 10:31.756
She is so excited.

10:31.780 --> 10:33.626
Yeah, me too.

10:33.650 --> 10:36.796
- Birthday party at four bells.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:36.820 --> 10:39.536
See you there... Mama.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.530
Okay.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.306
Riddle has summoned me
to headquarters

10:47.330 --> 10:49.546
for an inquiry hearing
into our response times.

10:49.570 --> 10:51.986
We couldn't get through
the blockade any faster.

10:52.010 --> 10:54.346
51 did nothing wrong at
that crack house fire, Chief.

10:54.370 --> 10:55.916
Doesn't matter.

10:55.940 --> 10:57.516
You know how this works.

10:57.540 --> 11:00.426
As incident commander, it's
on me to explain our actions.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.856
Everyone from squad will
have their story straight.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.726
- Trust me.
- Don't talk to them yet.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.326
I want to keep lid on it until...

11:07.350 --> 11:09.866
until it plays itself out.

11:09.890 --> 11:11.690
Understood.

11:14.660 --> 11:18.060
What the hell's Jack Nesbitt
doing at 51 without his handler?

11:18.970 --> 11:20.036
I give up.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.276
He's trying to get to Katya's
notebook before the Feds do.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.276
You know why?

11:24.300 --> 11:26.446
'Cause it'll bury him.

11:26.470 --> 11:27.746
It's their case.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.356
He's running a game
on all of you, Voight.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.226
Girls are being trafficked.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.326
Nesbitt's wiping his ass
with your badge.

11:34.350 --> 11:35.596
Maybe you didn't hear me.

11:35.620 --> 11:38.456
I saw Katya get shot and
killed in front of me.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.626
I did what I had to do
to stay alive.

11:40.650 --> 11:43.196
What you're telling me
you're doing is nothing.

11:43.220 --> 11:45.320
Casey...

11:47.290 --> 11:50.206
I know what
you went through,

11:50.230 --> 11:52.246
but you got to back off.

11:52.270 --> 11:54.906
You're gonna get yourself
jammed up.

11:54.930 --> 11:58.170
Either you do something,
or I will.

12:09.378 --> 12:12.218
What you looking at?

12:12.710 --> 12:14.846
All right, tell me that
isn't the cutest little guy

12:14.870 --> 12:15.886
you've ever seen.

12:15.910 --> 12:19.626
You went back to the
hospital to check on the baby?

12:19.650 --> 12:20.627
Yeah.

12:20.651 --> 12:22.866
Brett, you can't do that.

12:22.890 --> 12:24.426
We talked about this.

12:24.450 --> 12:26.436
I know.
You're totally right.

12:26.460 --> 12:29.296
Excuse me.
Kelly Severide... he work here?

12:29.320 --> 12:30.466
Yeah.

12:30.490 --> 12:31.866
He expecting you?

12:31.890 --> 12:33.976
- No, I'm just dropping in.
- Oh, cool.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.876
Well, I'm sure he'll be thrilled.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.906
Where am I going?

12:38.930 --> 12:40.370
Great, thanks.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.886
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

12:48.910 --> 12:50.526
I'm here to get you
back on track,

12:50.550 --> 12:51.926
you troubled manager, you.

12:51.950 --> 12:54.526
- How are you?
- I'm good.

12:54.550 --> 12:56.296
Do you have an office
we can huddle up in?

12:56.320 --> 12:57.766
I did.

12:57.790 --> 12:59.566
Now I have a bunk.

12:59.590 --> 13:01.836
Then we'll just have
to study our asses off,

13:01.860 --> 13:03.436
so we can run
this poacher out of here.

13:03.460 --> 13:04.536
Yeah.

13:04.560 --> 13:07.776
Or you can copy my
worksheet and owe me one.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.506
My old man
always warned me:

13:09.530 --> 13:11.176
Never owe a favor
to a lawyer.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.406
Well, then I'm going to sue him
for defamation.

13:13.430 --> 13:15.516
Funny.

13:15.540 --> 13:17.886
Can I see you later?

13:17.910 --> 13:20.940
If you play
your cards right.

13:28.150 --> 13:31.266
Like it's not bad enough
that 51's under siege.

13:31.290 --> 13:33.166
Now they're gunning
for Molly's?

13:33.190 --> 13:34.296
Who?

13:34.320 --> 13:36.906
The Portland jagoffs next door.

13:36.930 --> 13:38.406
- The canoe people?
- Yeah.

13:38.430 --> 13:40.576
They reported us for violating
the city's noise ordinance.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.906
- Can you believe that crap?
- What?

13:42.930 --> 13:44.576
They seem
completely harmless.

13:44.600 --> 13:47.516
Yeah, beneath those
beards and the baby Bjorns,

13:47.540 --> 13:49.216
they're flesh-eating
piranhas.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.016
They want a war,
they're gonna get a war.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.316
Easy there, Crazy Horse.

13:54.340 --> 13:57.056
Let's talk
this one out, yeah?

13:57.080 --> 13:59.286
- What's Molly's?
- Molly's?

13:59.310 --> 14:01.156
It's the best damn refuge
in the city,

14:01.180 --> 14:02.626
a salt-of-the-earth
kind of joint

14:02.650 --> 14:06.366
where we serve cold comfort
to red-blooded Americans.

14:06.390 --> 14:09.336
So a bar?

14:09.360 --> 14:10.566
An amazing bar.

14:10.590 --> 14:13.406
Just go clean some pots
and pans, candidate.

14:13.430 --> 14:15.160
Go.

14:17.130 --> 14:19.616
I don't think we go thermonuclear
on this one, Herrmie.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.046
Why not?

14:21.070 --> 14:24.740
Don't... don't take
the Chicago to them.

14:25.640 --> 14:29.140
Take the...
Take the Portland.

14:31.650 --> 14:33.456
That's good.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.220
I like that.

14:39.990 --> 14:42.090
Thanks for coming. Only one.

14:44.090 --> 14:46.006
Get them while
the getting's good, Dawson.

14:46.030 --> 14:48.876
Your license to get fat and
sassy only lasts nine months.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.706
Looks delicious.

14:51.730 --> 14:53.576
Borderline criminal...
I'd have seconds,

14:53.600 --> 14:57.040
but the Tums is duking
it out with the meatballs.

14:57.740 --> 15:01.286
Is that the crack house
fire on West 24th Street?

15:01.310 --> 15:03.226
51 worked it, right?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.186
Yeah, they're being
looked at for negligence.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.256
May I take a look?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.320
Go for it.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.766
"Suspicious unknown."

15:14.790 --> 15:17.306
Translation: Looks a
hell of a lot like arson.

15:17.330 --> 15:19.036
We just can't prove it.

15:19.060 --> 15:21.836
Possible to do a walk-through?

15:21.860 --> 15:23.900
What do you say, Duffy?

15:25.870 --> 15:27.770
Do it.

15:29.740 --> 15:32.746
Crack house was here,
north side of West 24th.

15:32.770 --> 15:35.916
Blockade of abandoned vehicles
was at this intersection.

15:35.940 --> 15:37.886
Truck 81 approached
from the east.

15:37.910 --> 15:40.326
Your 30 eyewitnesses...
where the hell are they?

15:40.350 --> 15:41.656
Look, obviously,
the neighborhood

15:41.680 --> 15:42.856
is circling the wagons.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.016
Nobody wants to catch the blame
for the death of the squatter.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.586
And you can't produce a
single cell phone video?

15:46.610 --> 15:49.710
You know as well as I do
this accusation is absurd.

15:50.710 --> 15:53.186
Some neighbor probably
torched that place

15:53.210 --> 15:56.956
- and then blocked the street.
- That'll be all, Chief Boden.

15:56.980 --> 15:58.456
Quite frankly,
I think I deserve

15:58.480 --> 16:01.520
a little bit more support
from my Deputy District Chief.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.296
You know
how things work, Chief.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.136
I serve different masters.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.606
Be that as it may.

16:09.630 --> 16:11.676
We'll be in contact as
soon as Internal Affairs

16:11.700 --> 16:13.806
makes its preliminary findings.

16:13.830 --> 16:15.870
IAD is involved now?

16:26.140 --> 16:28.186
Benny Severide's kid.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.586
Graduated top of your class,

16:29.610 --> 16:32.296
voted by your peers Gene
Blackmon award winner,

16:32.320 --> 16:34.550
youngest guy
ever assigned to squad.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.766
- That it?
- One more thing.

16:37.790 --> 16:40.366
- The crack house fire.
- What about it?

16:40.390 --> 16:42.366
Well, if this investigation
goes any further,

16:42.390 --> 16:43.906
I don't want any surprises.

16:43.930 --> 16:46.236
Anybody asks what happened,
I'll tell them, same as always.

16:46.260 --> 16:49.406
Which is what?

16:49.430 --> 16:51.246
We rolled up.
Cars blocked it.

16:51.270 --> 16:53.316
You hopped behind the wheel,
shoved them out of the way.

16:53.340 --> 16:56.140
After I gave fair warning.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.880
After you gave fair warning.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.596
Ambulance 61, man down
from unknown causes.

17:08.619 --> 17:10.990
12th Street at Lake Michigan.

17:14.460 --> 17:15.836
Excuse us.

17:15.859 --> 17:18.205
Back up, please.

17:18.230 --> 17:21.445
- Oh, thank God.
- I got it.

17:21.470 --> 17:22.906
What happened?

17:22.930 --> 17:24.346
I took his paddle board out.

17:24.369 --> 17:27.185
When I came back, Mikey...
he was grabbing his chest,

17:27.210 --> 17:30.586
and he collapsed onto
the sand face-first.

17:30.610 --> 17:32.116
He doesn't have a pulse.

17:32.140 --> 17:33.426
Is he dying?

17:33.450 --> 17:35.880
- What, are you guys friends?
- He's my fiancé.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.436
Charging.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.460
Clear.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.136
Still in V-tach.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.506
61 to Main,
I need a manpower assist.

17:55.530 --> 17:58.070
Keep doing compressions.
I'll intubate.

18:15.020 --> 18:16.896
I'm in.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.960
Stop compressions.

18:22.290 --> 18:24.106
- Still in V-tach.
- What does that mean?

18:24.130 --> 18:25.530
We need an EPI.

18:28.630 --> 18:31.116
Pushing EPI.

18:31.140 --> 18:34.200
- Clear.
- Oh, my God, God, please...

18:35.540 --> 18:37.610
Does she not know
what "clear" means?

18:39.020 --> 18:40.390
Stay on him. I got her.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.206
61 to Main, we need
a second ambo now.

18:45.230 --> 18:48.130
Copy that, 61.
Second ambo on the way.

18:57.410 --> 18:59.086
- She's in V-fib.
- I'm gonna push an EPI.

18:59.110 --> 19:01.726
Do it. Charging.

19:01.750 --> 19:04.550
Clear.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.196
She's got a rhythm.

19:08.220 --> 19:10.596
I got him.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.336
- Still nothing?
- Uh-uh.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.960
Push another EPI.

19:21.630 --> 19:23.676
61 to Main,
hold off on the assist company.

19:23.700 --> 19:24.497
Copy that.

19:24.521 --> 19:26.456
Accidental V-fib,
shocked her one time.

19:26.480 --> 19:27.846
How many EPIs
have you given this guy?

19:27.870 --> 19:30.346
- This is the fourth.
- Push one more and call it.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.856
- He's not gonna make it.
- No, I'm not doing that.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.910
I don't give a damn
what the SMOs say.

19:37.350 --> 19:40.396
- Last shot.
- Okay.

19:40.420 --> 19:42.150
Pushing EPI.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.936
Stop.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.236
I got a pulse.

19:49.260 --> 19:53.376
Praise the Lord.
Seriously, thanks.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.660
He's got a shot.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.500
Excuse me,
can we get help over here?

20:08.480 --> 20:09.956
Cardiac arrest,
five rounds of EPI,

20:09.980 --> 20:11.656
unconscious for
at least 17 minutes.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.980
Got him.
Someone call respiratory.

20:18.090 --> 20:21.136
Aw.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.990
Just this once?

20:27.060 --> 20:29.360
Okay.

20:32.340 --> 20:35.116
Little guy is pretty cute, huh?

20:35.140 --> 20:37.200
He's beautiful.

20:39.180 --> 20:40.656
Yeah, he is.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.426
You guys need help?

20:43.450 --> 20:46.726
No, actually,
we're the paramedics.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.096
We saved the little guy.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.566
Oh, yeah, right.

20:49.590 --> 20:51.266
Has the family
come to visit yet?

20:51.290 --> 20:53.596
No, not yet.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.590
Thanks.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.576
We had a deal.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.206
It's the last time.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.670
Last time.

21:30.430 --> 21:32.676
- Watch your step.
- Thanks.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.406
Point of ignition
was directly below us,

21:34.430 --> 21:36.276
so the floor joists
are weakened.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.530
Right.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.316
You can see from
the burn patterns

21:44.340 --> 21:46.056
how it spread to
the upstairs bedroom.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.556
That track with
what you remember?

21:47.580 --> 21:51.510
Oh, I was in the building
next door.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.836
Dawson,
the fire's over here.

22:02.860 --> 22:04.930
Well, what's that?

22:10.570 --> 22:13.670
Let's check the basement.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.170
Hey.

22:33.140 --> 22:34.616
Is that a kick hole?

22:34.640 --> 22:37.756
Looks like someone booted
through the Sheetrock.

22:37.780 --> 22:39.710
Open it up.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.976
It must have been starved
for a lack of oxygen,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.946
but it definitely
burned inside this wall.

22:58.970 --> 23:00.706
No, no, no,
it doesn't make sense,

23:00.730 --> 23:04.400
unless this was done
by a professional.

23:05.610 --> 23:09.270
Who torched both sides to
make sure that it burned.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.096
I have everything
written down.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.096
- Let me see them.
- I don't have it with me.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.490
Katya!

23:25.320 --> 23:26.866
Hey.

23:26.890 --> 23:29.006
Hey.

23:29.030 --> 23:31.000
How's it going
with Patterson?

23:33.200 --> 23:34.706
I don't know.

23:34.730 --> 23:35.946
Maybe they're right.

23:35.970 --> 23:38.276
Maybe I'm better off as
a smoke-eater than a boss.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.546
Tell you one thing, I
don't miss the paperwork.

23:40.570 --> 23:43.456
Forget that, man.
It's all politics.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.426
You're getting sucked
into this Riddle BS.

23:45.450 --> 23:47.280
Yeah, maybe.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.766
Is that her?
The girl that died?

23:53.790 --> 23:57.320
Yeah, didn't even spell
her name right.

23:58.220 --> 24:01.306
Casey, Severide,
these men

24:01.330 --> 24:03.776
are gonna need statements
from everyone here at 51.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.806
Give them
your full cooperation.

24:05.830 --> 24:07.046
What's the deal, Chief?

24:07.070 --> 24:08.646
Just answer their questions.

24:08.670 --> 24:10.430
They're from Internal Affairs.

24:16.980 --> 24:18.356
You're aware that
you're under oath,

24:18.380 --> 24:20.026
that the following
interview will be recorded?

24:20.050 --> 24:21.286
Yeah.

24:21.310 --> 24:24.396
And would you like a union
rep or attorney present?

24:24.420 --> 24:26.066
No.

24:26.090 --> 24:29.196
Where exactly was Truck
81 when the call came in

24:29.220 --> 24:31.596
for the crack house fire
on West 24th?

24:31.620 --> 24:34.106
We were the first company
on the scene.

24:34.130 --> 24:36.706
In fact, we were closer
because of where we started.

24:36.730 --> 24:40.046
Just answer the question,
Lieutenant.

24:40.070 --> 24:41.976
Stilettos.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.946
That's a strip club,
is that correct?

24:43.970 --> 24:46.116
It was an off-duty
construction job,

24:46.140 --> 24:49.610
and I was involved in an undercover
investigation for the CPD.

24:49.910 --> 24:51.416
That can be verified.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.486
We want to get
the facts straight.

24:53.510 --> 24:54.786
You fellas want to know
what happened,

24:54.810 --> 24:56.696
why don't you ask the guy
we pulled out next door?

24:56.720 --> 24:57.856
Carl Nash?

24:57.880 --> 24:59.266
I don't know his name,

24:59.290 --> 25:01.826
but he said the place was "a
blight on the neighborhood."

25:01.850 --> 25:03.996
That's a direct quote.

25:04.020 --> 25:05.466
The City
wasn't doing anything.

25:05.490 --> 25:07.806
The people were pissed off,
so that's why they let it burn.

25:07.830 --> 25:09.676
Nash is no longer
at that residence.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.776
You guys try the hospitals,
his relatives?

25:11.800 --> 25:13.606
We've canvassed
the entire neighborhood,

25:13.630 --> 25:16.476
and as of now, not a single
person's come forward...

25:16.500 --> 25:17.846
Yeah, sounds like they're
covering their asses.

25:17.870 --> 25:21.640
Perhaps Firehouse 51
should do the same.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.756
This is a serious allegation.

25:26.780 --> 25:28.996
If it's determined that
you slow-walked that fire,

25:29.020 --> 25:31.326
Chief Boden will be charged
with dereliction of duty

25:31.350 --> 25:33.880
and relieved
of his command.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.970
Anyone here?

26:34.690 --> 26:36.856
- Hey.
- You lost or something?

26:36.880 --> 26:39.746
No, I'm looking for the guy
who lives next door, Carl.

26:39.770 --> 26:41.216
- Do you know him?
- What do you want him for?

26:41.240 --> 26:42.456
I'm a firefighter.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.516
We pulled him out of a
blaze about a week ago.

26:44.540 --> 26:46.986
I just got a few questions.
That's all.

26:47.010 --> 26:50.450
Carl didn't see nothing,
and Carl don't know nothing.

26:51.250 --> 26:53.566
That's not
what I asked you.

26:53.590 --> 26:55.466
Do you know
where he is or not?

26:55.490 --> 26:58.060
Step off, fireman.

27:14.610 --> 27:16.156
My name's Kelly Severide.

27:16.180 --> 27:17.286
Do you remember me?

27:17.310 --> 27:19.626
Yeah, I remember.

27:19.650 --> 27:23.250
Okay, well, I wouldn't be
here unless it was important.

27:24.150 --> 27:26.566
We risked our lives
running into that house.

27:26.590 --> 27:29.166
Now they're saying
we were slow to respond.

27:29.190 --> 27:32.206
We need someone to come
forward and tell the truth

27:32.230 --> 27:35.860
that the neighbors were
blocking the streets.

27:42.170 --> 27:45.846
Like the man said,
I didn't see anything,

27:45.870 --> 27:49.410
and I don't know anything.

27:57.180 --> 27:58.596
Hey, got a minute?

27:58.620 --> 28:01.126
What's up?

28:01.150 --> 28:03.096
Whoever torched that
place wasn't an amateur.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.366
- You put it in a report?
- Yeah.

28:05.390 --> 28:08.406
Can I see it?

28:08.430 --> 28:09.690
Sit.

28:24.540 --> 28:28.110
I've been at OFI, what,
coming on 12 years now?

28:28.820 --> 28:30.526
I'm what they call
a short-timer.

28:30.550 --> 28:32.496
I applaud your
get-up-and-go, Dawson.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.566
Genuinely, I do,

28:34.590 --> 28:36.866
but you need to understand
the reality of working here.

28:36.890 --> 28:40.390
99 out of 100 cases get
stamped "suspicious unknown"

28:40.990 --> 28:44.960
for a reason, because arson's
damn near impossible to prove.

28:45.470 --> 28:48.946
And even if you catch a guy
holding a can full of gas

28:48.970 --> 28:52.870
and a box full of matches,
it's tough to make it stick.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.816
So you want me
to drop the case?

28:57.840 --> 28:59.626
Hell, no.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.496
Just...

29:02.520 --> 29:04.750
manage
your expectations.

29:07.220 --> 29:08.650
Thanks.

29:09.990 --> 29:12.160
He slammed the door
in my face.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.106
It was all I could do to
stop from kicking it down

29:14.130 --> 29:15.606
and just
shaking him.

29:15.630 --> 29:19.160
Well, you know what they
tell you in class, right?

29:19.770 --> 29:22.446
Step back,
take a deep breath,

29:22.470 --> 29:27.546
scan your body from head to
toe for any signs of stress.

29:27.570 --> 29:31.240
Personally, I find this
much more effective.

29:33.550 --> 29:36.196
Come, sit.

29:36.220 --> 29:40.096
Let's buckle down and take that
corner office back from him.

29:40.120 --> 29:43.320
This is the evolution.

29:44.220 --> 29:47.366
You know what works
even better than scotch?

29:47.390 --> 29:50.276
No, tell me.

29:50.300 --> 29:52.406
Love.

29:52.430 --> 29:55.746
Any way she can.

29:55.770 --> 30:00.746
These brutal games.

30:00.770 --> 30:04.386
Are driving me away.

30:04.410 --> 30:09.456
We should be great.

30:09.480 --> 30:11.180
But you're too afraid.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.366
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:19.390 --> 30:20.706
What's up?

30:20.730 --> 30:22.106
Feds dropped off my tools.

30:22.130 --> 30:25.206
Apparently, Stilettos is no
longer an active crime scene.

30:25.230 --> 30:26.476
You okay?

30:26.500 --> 30:28.816
I was just going through
them once more in case Katya

30:28.840 --> 30:30.276
stashed the notebook inside.

30:30.300 --> 30:33.516
No luck, huh?

30:33.540 --> 30:36.086
I'm sorry.

30:36.110 --> 30:38.616
I'm so ready to start this
life with you, me, and the baby.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.086
I'm just trying
to put this behind me,

30:41.110 --> 30:42.256
and it hasn't been easy.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.880
No, it's fine, it's fine.
I totally get it.

30:46.890 --> 30:48.966
Didn't even ask
how your day was.

30:48.990 --> 30:50.166
It was good.

30:50.190 --> 30:51.796
I started looking into
the crack house fire,

30:51.820 --> 30:53.790
- and I found something interesting.
- Yeah?

30:59.970 --> 31:02.670
Okay.

31:02.770 --> 31:04.616
So the fire started here,
right...

31:04.640 --> 31:06.946
but I found a kick hole in
the basement on the other side.

31:06.970 --> 31:09.216
When I pried it open, I found
the remains of a second fire

31:09.240 --> 31:11.110
inside the walls.

31:14.820 --> 31:17.750
It was framed up.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.396
But there was no
Sheetrock at the time.

31:22.420 --> 31:25.620
What? No, there was Sheetrock.
Are you listening to me?

31:27.934 --> 31:31.864
I'll be back in a bit.

32:06.637 --> 32:08.667
Katya!

34:34.377 --> 34:37.516
I told you to stay out
of my business.

34:59.870 --> 35:02.946
Drop your weapon.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.470
- You don't understand.
- Last time.

35:14.910 --> 35:17.256
I'm a protected
federal informant.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.066
No kidding.

35:19.090 --> 35:21.720
Now, get your ass
against that truck.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.766
Your boy Casey is jeopardizing
an ongoing investigation,

35:26.790 --> 35:29.130
and he threatened my life.

35:30.130 --> 35:33.106
You know
how you drown a rat, Jack?

35:33.130 --> 35:35.816
You just toss his dumb ass
in the deep end,

35:35.840 --> 35:39.246
and you wait for him to sink.

35:39.270 --> 35:41.810
You're under arrest
for human trafficking

35:43.810 --> 35:45.386
and obstruction of justice.

35:45.410 --> 35:46.880
Let's go.

35:54.220 --> 35:57.436
Hey, you okay?

35:57.460 --> 35:58.960
Yeah.

36:00.930 --> 36:04.476
You were following me?

36:04.500 --> 36:08.376
Oh! Congratulations,
by the way.

36:08.400 --> 36:12.316
There's nothing better
than being a father.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.370
Go for Voight.

36:26.690 --> 36:27.966
- Hey.
- Look...

36:27.990 --> 36:31.496
Athena,
I'm here to apologize.

36:31.520 --> 36:34.006
I mean, having a little one...
I know what that's like.

36:34.030 --> 36:36.606
Those first six months
can be murder.

36:36.630 --> 36:38.000
Yeah, right.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.506
You got my word, we're gonna
keep the noise to a minimum.

36:40.530 --> 36:41.706
You can take that to the bank.

36:41.730 --> 36:44.646
Oh, well, that's not
so much what I had...

36:44.670 --> 36:46.546
Can you hear me out,
please?

36:46.570 --> 36:47.986
Okay.

36:48.010 --> 36:50.216
This place, Molly's...

36:50.240 --> 36:51.616
more than just a bar.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.386
It's a beacon of hope for
every firefighter and cop

36:54.410 --> 36:55.556
and paramedic
in the city,

36:55.580 --> 36:58.480
and when
that sign says "open,"

37:00.490 --> 37:03.636
no matter what somebody lived
through that day on the job,

37:03.660 --> 37:05.596
they know that
the beers are cold

37:05.620 --> 37:07.636
and that the
Blackhawks are on.

37:07.660 --> 37:11.150
It's the beating heart
of this neighborhood.

37:12.180 --> 37:16.266
So it's a token
of our respect.

37:16.290 --> 37:17.766
What is this?

37:17.790 --> 37:19.296
Blueberry crumble.
It's homemade.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.536
My wife, Cindy, made it,

37:20.560 --> 37:24.166
and it's for you and Ian
and your little guy, so...

37:24.190 --> 37:25.976
That's got sugar in it, right?

37:26.000 --> 37:27.836
It's what
makes it so sweet.

37:27.860 --> 37:31.246
My son is allergic to sugar.

37:31.270 --> 37:34.116
I'm pretty sure it's impossible
to be allergic to sugar.

37:34.140 --> 37:35.476
You telling me
how to raise my kid?

37:35.500 --> 37:37.546
As a matter of fact, I've
raised five of my own,

37:37.570 --> 37:39.556
- but, no, I never would.
- Oh, boy.

37:39.580 --> 37:42.540
No, I shudder to imagine
how they turned out.

37:43.650 --> 37:46.096
- Excuse me?
- I think you heard me.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.356
You're insulting my family?

37:47.380 --> 37:48.856
Look, it's Chris, right?

37:48.880 --> 37:52.190
No offense, but I just am not
interested in your wife's baking

37:53.190 --> 37:54.966
or your tips about
how to raise my kid

37:54.990 --> 37:57.266
or your empty promises
about your obnoxious bar.

37:57.290 --> 37:58.436
If you have something
to say to me,

37:58.460 --> 38:00.406
you can speak
to my attorney.

38:00.430 --> 38:01.830
Uh, lady.

38:03.800 --> 38:06.800
You can take that high and
mighty attitude back to Portland.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.510
This is Chicago.

38:25.820 --> 38:27.350
So...

38:30.330 --> 38:31.436
First shift.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.736
What do you have to say
for yourself, candidate?

38:33.760 --> 38:36.036
- Best job in the world.
- Cheers.

38:36.060 --> 38:39.076
And Herrmann was right.

38:39.100 --> 38:41.976
To Molly's, best refuge
in all of Chicago.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.016
Aw, there's no need
to suck up, Borrelli.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.356
They're gonna bust your
balls no matter what.

38:46.380 --> 38:47.986
You're the candidate, son.

38:48.010 --> 38:50.756
For real.
Feels like family.

38:50.780 --> 38:53.556
Speaking of which, what
crimes against humanity

38:53.580 --> 38:54.896
is your brother
perpetrating tonight?

38:54.920 --> 38:55.727
Danny's all right.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.926
That was just big brother
little brother stuff.

38:57.950 --> 38:59.636
- Everybody goes through it.
- You sure?

38:59.660 --> 39:01.036
'Cause I have a little brother,

39:01.060 --> 39:04.066
and I never toilet paper-mummied
him on his first day on the job.

39:04.090 --> 39:07.336
It's cool.
I got a handle on it.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.506
Hey, you.

39:09.530 --> 39:12.816
- Hey, look at you.
- What's up?

39:12.840 --> 39:14.046
When did you get back?

39:14.070 --> 39:15.146
Last week.

39:15.170 --> 39:18.170
- So how was it?
- Amazing, amazing.

39:18.570 --> 39:21.116
You know, there's only one
thing better than trekking

39:21.140 --> 39:22.626
all over this big blue world:

39:22.650 --> 39:24.126
Coming home to Chicago.

39:24.150 --> 39:25.426
Sorry to interrupt.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.756
Severide,
can I get a word?

39:27.780 --> 39:29.696
Uh, sure, yeah.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.826
Good to see you.

39:31.850 --> 39:33.590
You too.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.306
What's up?

39:38.330 --> 39:39.336
Heard you went
to see the old man

39:39.360 --> 39:40.476
who lives next
to the crack house.

39:40.500 --> 39:41.676
Yeah, I tried.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.176
The neighbors are
turning the screws on him.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.846
He stonewalled me.

39:44.870 --> 39:48.046
Told you I hate surprises, right?

39:48.070 --> 39:49.546
This was off duty.

39:49.570 --> 39:52.040
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.416
Next time you go making a
move that affects Squad 3,

39:55.440 --> 40:00.826
be that on or off shift,
you clear it with me first.

40:00.850 --> 40:03.580
Understood?

40:08.520 --> 40:11.930
All right, people, this
next round is on me.

40:17.700 --> 40:20.100
How'd it go?

40:30.380 --> 40:32.896
When the U.S. Marines
stormed Panama

40:32.920 --> 40:36.426
to run that crook
Noriega out on a rail,

40:36.450 --> 40:40.090
he was holed up in the Holy
See, so how did we smoke him out?

40:43.360 --> 40:45.466
A little piece
of something special,

40:45.490 --> 40:51.076
PSYOPS called noise warfare.

40:51.100 --> 40:54.816
These Portland pinheads are
about to get a little taste

40:54.840 --> 40:59.216
of Panama City circa 1989.

40:59.240 --> 41:02.910
It is karaoke night,
everyone!

41:04.380 --> 41:06.750
Man your battle stations!

41:09.290 --> 41:10.496
Hit it, Mouch.

41:10.520 --> 41:11.896
You know the tune.

41:11.920 --> 41:14.336
Simple Minds'
"Don't You Forget about Me" plays.

41:14.360 --> 41:17.836
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:17.860 --> 41:20.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:20.630 --> 41:23.160
Whoa, whoa.

41:29.770 --> 41:32.316
Don't you.

41:32.340 --> 41:35.886
Forget about me.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.456
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.210
Don't you.
