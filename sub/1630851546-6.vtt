00:23.110 --> 00:24.589
Hannah, it's Nancy again.

00:24.633 --> 00:28.637
The real Frozen Hearts Killer
is a supernatural entity.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.813
Ten-year-old Richard Trott
came across it

00:30.856 --> 00:33.337
on his paper route in 1992.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.600
A friend from theLedger
slipped me some records

00:35.644 --> 00:37.211
from back in the day.

00:37.254 --> 00:40.736
I managed to piece together
Trott's childhood route.

00:40.779 --> 00:43.913
Problem is I can't seem to crack

00:43.956 --> 00:47.134
where the supernatural killer
might be.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.050
[bike bell rings]

01:19.688 --> 01:21.211
[sighs]

01:22.517 --> 01:23.648
[phone beeps]

01:23.692 --> 01:25.650
Hi, Hannah. Me again.

01:25.694 --> 01:28.349
Uh, turns out my map
was only half right.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.090
Shouldn't surprise me.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.917
Town's changed a lot.

01:31.961 --> 01:35.747
What I really needed was a map
of Horseshoe Bay from 1992.

01:35.791 --> 01:38.315
That should get me through
the rest of Trott's paper route.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.491
However, I do need your help

01:40.535 --> 01:42.537
to make sure this thing
doesn't kill again,

01:42.580 --> 01:44.800
so please call me back.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.474
Mm.

02:24.927 --> 02:28.278
[sighs]
Gotcha.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.324
â™ª

02:41.726 --> 02:43.206
[George sighs]

02:43.250 --> 02:44.860
You don't make enough money
to keep covering supplies

02:44.903 --> 02:46.688
for the youth center, and
I'm not giving you a raise.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.124
[phone vibrates]So make sure that
you get reimbursed

02:48.168 --> 02:49.343
next time.Oh.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.519
Nick has just Chimed me.

02:51.562 --> 02:52.781
It's all good.Nice.

02:52.824 --> 02:55.087
At least he's
Chiming someone.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.567
Wait, he owes you money,

02:56.611 --> 02:58.917
too?Not money, but he sure owes me.

02:58.961 --> 03:01.006
An apology,
a good night's sleep.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.052
We haven't talked
since our argument last night.

03:03.095 --> 03:04.314
This is all
about that little lie

03:04.358 --> 03:06.360
about going to see that dentist?

03:06.403 --> 03:08.188
It wasn't a little lie, okay?

03:08.231 --> 03:10.407
I did go to a dentist.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.453
He just wasn't my dentist.No,

03:12.496 --> 03:13.845
it was your biological father.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.456
You didn't tell Nick
that bit at first.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.762
It's kind of like a lie
without lying.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.982
Am I supposed to alert Nick
to every single thing I do

03:20.025 --> 03:21.244
in the moment that I do it?

03:21.288 --> 03:22.941
Sometimes my timeline
takes precedence,

03:22.985 --> 03:24.204
like right now.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.075
I'm spending the day
finding a way

03:26.118 --> 03:27.511
to make sure that I don't die
in ten years.Wait,

03:27.555 --> 03:30.993
you think you can untangle
your soul from Odette's?

03:31.036 --> 03:33.038
Hannah said that was impossible.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.866
Nothing is impossible
is what I learned

03:34.910 --> 03:36.346
from confronting
George Sr., DDS.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.261
Bess, I need to fight harder
for my life,

03:38.305 --> 03:40.785
and I am not giving up
until I look under every rock.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.744
Or book.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.487
[sighs]

03:49.272 --> 03:52.884
Uh, Ryan, why are you sat
in the crafts corner?

03:52.928 --> 03:54.799
That's usually where, uh,
what's her name?

03:54.843 --> 03:56.845
Addy sits, right?

03:56.888 --> 03:58.716
Yeah, yeah, Addy's sick,
so I'm subbing in.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.066
Oh, no. Is it a cold?

04:01.110 --> 04:02.285
What?Something worse

04:02.329 --> 04:04.200
than a cold. Mono?
It's not mono, is it?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.289
Wait, wait, hold up.
Mono's going around here?BESS: Okay,

04:06.333 --> 04:07.638
Ryan,
let's not play these games.

04:07.682 --> 04:08.944
If you want to ask, just ask.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.380
Ask what?BESS:
I just want

04:10.424 --> 04:11.686
to make sure I didn't
get what she had.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.122
You know, I barely know her.

04:13.165 --> 04:15.211
It was just a coffee date
and a meaningless hookup,

04:15.255 --> 04:16.691
but... [chuckles]
Did we kiss?

04:16.734 --> 04:18.388
Yes, sure, we kissed.Okay. Okay, um...

04:18.432 --> 04:21.130
Was saliva exchanged?
Yes, sure, it was, but, uh...

04:21.173 --> 04:23.219
You know, so,
germs would be the only thing

04:23.263 --> 04:24.786
that I'm worried about
because it went nowhere,

04:24.829 --> 04:25.700
and that's fine
because I'm not looking

04:25.743 --> 04:26.788
for a relationship.

04:26.831 --> 04:29.094
[chuckles]

04:30.095 --> 04:30.966
Okay.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.663
I am so sorry
that I sat here.

04:32.707 --> 04:36.276
[sighs]Oh, thanks for bringing
the art supplies over.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.321
You're welcome. Um...

04:38.365 --> 04:42.151
Is there anything that you
wanted to talk to me about?

04:42.934 --> 04:45.676
I had to fix the
vacuum cleaner again.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.288
That is twice this week.

04:50.072 --> 04:52.161
That's what you wanted
to talk about

04:52.204 --> 04:53.336
this morning?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.905
This about last night?

04:56.948 --> 04:59.168
Oh, you are unbelievable.

04:59.211 --> 05:01.344
You want to know why
your vacuum keeps breaking?

05:01.388 --> 05:02.650
It's getting clogged

05:02.693 --> 05:03.477
from everything
you keep sweeping under the rug.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.175
[phones vibrate]

05:08.656 --> 05:11.659
Ah. Yeah, me and George,
um, we can't do this.

05:11.702 --> 05:14.052
Uh, we have a...

05:14.096 --> 05:17.229
goddess manifestation
chakra class to go to.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.275
Can't be late. No refunds,
so just have to tell Nancy

05:19.319 --> 05:21.277
that she'll have to make do
with you and Ace.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.366
Where's Ace?Uh,

05:23.410 --> 05:25.629
he's not here. He said he
has some personal errand.

05:25.673 --> 05:28.632
All right, Ryan. You're up.
Cover for us. Thank you.

05:28.676 --> 05:29.894
See you.Thanks.

05:29.938 --> 05:32.244
What?NANCY:
All hands on deck

05:32.288 --> 05:34.029
to track down
a supernatural killer.[door opens]

05:36.814 --> 05:38.599
Where is everybody?Uh,

05:38.642 --> 05:40.601
Ace had to go take
care of something,

05:40.644 --> 05:44.387
and George just went with
Bess to manifest a goddess.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.302
Okay. So,
here's where we are.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.826
The real Frozen Hearts Killer
is supernatural.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.175
The cops don't know this.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.612
They wouldn't believe it
even if they did.

05:51.655 --> 05:54.092
So they won't be able
to catch the actual killer.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.094
You're going after this thing?

05:56.138 --> 05:57.661
Weare.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.271
Ryan,

05:59.315 --> 06:02.753
if you want to listen,
just come over here,

06:02.797 --> 06:04.276
because you are
making me crazy.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.409
Did you say
"supernatural killer"?

06:06.453 --> 06:08.106
You and I encountered it
in Icarus Hall.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.021
It's the same entity
that came after us.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.545
[growls]

06:11.588 --> 06:12.807
The-the one with the hat.

06:12.850 --> 06:13.982
It used to be locked up

06:14.025 --> 06:16.637
in an occult cage
underground.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.074
I saw it in Trott's
childhood memories.

06:19.857 --> 06:20.902
RYAN:
Wait, what?

06:20.945 --> 06:23.513
So, you're reading minds now?

06:23.557 --> 06:24.862
It was a one-off.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.342
My creepy
200-year-old great-aunt

06:26.386 --> 06:28.039
talked me into doing
a very strange ritual.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.389
It won't happen again.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.738
So, where exactly

06:30.781 --> 06:32.522
is this underground
occult cage?

06:32.566 --> 06:35.395
Mm.And where do you find someone
to make one of those?

06:35.438 --> 06:37.440
Did a little research.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.660
Scoped out the area.

06:39.703 --> 06:43.707
There used to be long dirt
road between here and Trenton,

06:43.751 --> 06:46.710
but now it's blocked with
a housing development.

06:46.754 --> 06:49.104
But right here...

06:49.147 --> 06:52.890
That is where
the real Frozen Hearts Killer...

06:52.934 --> 06:54.631
The thing in the hat.Yeah.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.938
Used to be locked up.

06:56.981 --> 07:00.637
And sometime between 1992
and now, it got out.

07:00.681 --> 07:02.726
So, if you do
find that cage,

07:02.770 --> 07:05.816
are you sure the Frozen
Hearts Killer won't be there?

07:05.860 --> 07:07.818
In Trott's memory,
the thing was being locked up

07:07.862 --> 07:09.080
against its will. I...

07:09.124 --> 07:10.691
No matter how it got out,

07:10.734 --> 07:11.996
I don't think
it would risk coming back.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.434
Why do you
keep saying "you"?

07:14.477 --> 07:17.611
Uh... Okay, I probably
should have led with this,

07:17.654 --> 07:18.742
but you were on a roll.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.265
I can't come.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.572
I got back-to-back tutoring
sessions scheduled,

07:22.616 --> 07:24.269
and I don't want to
cancel on the kids.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.489
I... I can go.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.013
You know, i-if you'll...
If you'll spare me.

07:29.057 --> 07:32.147
Hey. Hey, not a problem
at all. In fact,

07:32.190 --> 07:34.149
great idea, and you can

07:34.192 --> 07:36.586
keep each other
out of trouble.

07:36.630 --> 07:39.154
Hmm? Hmm?

07:39.197 --> 07:43.288
You wantto come with me
on a quest to track down

07:43.332 --> 07:46.509
a supernatural
heart-freezing killing machine?See,

07:46.553 --> 07:49.120
when you say it like that,
it sounds super cool.

07:49.164 --> 07:50.818
Okay.Yeah.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.341
One hand on deck.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.561
Mm-hmm.The town is counting on us.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.432
We can't let another person die.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.442
When I noticed he had
blood on his hands,

08:06.486 --> 08:08.096
I told Mr. Bobbsey
to get out of my car,

08:08.139 --> 08:10.446
and that's the last
that I saw of him.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.797
I haven't heard from him since.
I have no idea where he is.

08:13.841 --> 08:16.365
Okay. Just sign here
verifying your statement.

08:16.408 --> 08:19.150
Wait. Don't sign anything yet.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.721
Where's Ace's
immunity agreement?

08:25.548 --> 08:28.159
That was my stipulation
with Jean.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.335
Ace testifies
as the State's witness

08:30.379 --> 08:32.686
in exchange for immunity.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.557
I can't speak for the D.A.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.778
Well, if she reneges on our deal
and this was just a ploy

08:37.821 --> 08:39.736
to get Ace to admit
what he knows on the record,

08:39.780 --> 08:43.566
you can forget about using that
unsworn statement against him.

08:43.610 --> 08:46.047
I'll take it up with the judge.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.789
Suit yourself.

08:48.832 --> 08:51.400
[door opens, closes]

08:51.443 --> 08:54.838
Look, n...
This isn't over yet.

09:00.278 --> 09:03.238
ACE:
What are my parents doing here?

09:03.281 --> 09:05.980
Hey. What's going on? Mom?

09:06.023 --> 09:08.286
Um...

09:09.723 --> 09:11.463
What happened?

09:11.507 --> 09:14.205
Someone threw a brick

09:14.249 --> 09:17.034
into your window last night

09:17.078 --> 09:19.297
with the message

09:19.341 --> 09:20.603
"rat" on it.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.865
This Bertram Bobbsey,

09:21.909 --> 09:23.998
he knows that I'm talking
to the police.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.565
He's at the top
of our list of suspects.

09:25.608 --> 09:28.611
Are you sure there's
nothing else you can tell us?

09:28.655 --> 09:31.353
You think Ace is withholding
information from you?

09:31.396 --> 09:33.921
That's why the D.A.
pulled our immunity deal?

09:33.964 --> 09:36.053
No, forget me. I just...

09:36.097 --> 09:38.403
I want
my parents protected.

09:40.971 --> 09:43.234
JOYCE:
Let's get your statement.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.197
Don't worry about us.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.634
I need you to stay safe.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.114
Thank you.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.598
[sighs]
I know what you're gonna say.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.208
That I should let the
cops do their job and...

10:00.251 --> 10:02.732
You need to find
Mr. Bobbsey.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.255
What?

10:04.299 --> 10:07.432
Without immunity, you're looking
at accessory to assault.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.218
Even if the D.A. lets you plead
that down to a misdemeanor,

10:10.261 --> 10:12.133
it still means jail time.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.526
The only route I see?

10:14.570 --> 10:16.267
Find Bobbsey.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.530
How am I supposed to do that?

10:19.531 --> 10:20.794
Look behind you.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.013
[chuckles]:
Ace!

10:23.057 --> 10:24.928
Amanda, what are you... Mm.Hi.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.930
[Amanda chuckles]Mm.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.106
Yeah. Okay,
I'm gonna get going.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.934
I'll call you
with any updates.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.936
Mm.[chuckles]

10:32.980 --> 10:34.938
When did you get in town?

10:34.982 --> 10:36.287
Oh, I took a red-eye.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.159
I got a call
from the Horseshoe Bay PD

10:38.202 --> 10:39.377
about my dad's whereabouts.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.857
I got worried,
so I came straight here.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.206
I was gonna call you
when I was done.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.078
What are you telling the cops?

10:44.121 --> 10:46.341
That I don't know
where he is.

10:46.384 --> 10:50.650
When my dad goes off the grid,
he commits.

10:50.693 --> 10:55.089
Hey, what were you talking
to Carson Drew about?

10:57.221 --> 11:00.137
Can I answer that over coffee?

11:02.879 --> 11:05.447
RYAN:
This is like you
in your element, right?

11:05.490 --> 11:08.493
Following clues,
searching for secret hideouts.[Nancy chuckles]

11:08.537 --> 11:11.671
I can just imagine you
as a kid.

11:11.714 --> 11:14.151
It's got to bring back some
girl detective memories, huh?

11:14.195 --> 11:16.676
Uh, I mean...

11:16.719 --> 11:19.548
When I was in eighth
grade, I did save a woman

11:19.591 --> 11:22.116
from a forest-based
naturopath, so...[chuckles]

11:22.159 --> 11:23.683
See? I knew it.

11:23.726 --> 11:24.988
Naturopaths. Right.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.686
What-what are...
What's a naturopath?

11:26.729 --> 11:29.166
Uh, in this case,
he was a con artist.

11:29.210 --> 11:32.169
He was selling fiddlehead
soup as love potion,

11:32.213 --> 11:33.997
and then he started
spiking the soup

11:34.041 --> 11:36.217
with an addictive
substance.

11:36.260 --> 11:40.264
And you probably don't care
about the details, so...

11:40.308 --> 11:42.745
Uh, actually, I...
I really do.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.878
You know, because I missed out
on all that...

11:44.921 --> 11:48.446
that time in your life,
I-I like to hear the stories.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.840
Okay. Um...

11:50.884 --> 11:52.842
Well, I searched the woods,

11:52.886 --> 11:56.716
and I found his-his illegal
pharmaceutical stash,

11:56.759 --> 12:00.458
proved he was a fraud,
and stopped that woman

12:00.502 --> 12:01.982
from spending her
college savings

12:02.025 --> 12:04.854
on his forest
remedies, so...[chuckles]

12:04.898 --> 12:07.074
You were a little badass
when you were a kid.[chuckles]

12:07.117 --> 12:09.467
Not-not that you
aren't now, of course.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.731
Well, thank you.
[chuckles]

12:11.774 --> 12:13.776
Uh, your turn for a story.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.387
Tell me something
I don't know.

12:16.431 --> 12:19.695
Tell me about my mother.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.698
Lucy.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.789
[chuckles]
Well, Lucy...

12:26.833 --> 12:28.878
She was really funny.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.533
A lot of people didn't
know that about her.

12:32.316 --> 12:35.798
She made me laugh all the time.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.715
I love knowing that.

12:42.979 --> 12:47.027
Uh, I think
it's just up this way.Yeah. Yeah.

12:51.335 --> 12:54.861
This fast-moving river looks
a lot smaller on this map.

12:54.904 --> 12:58.255
How did a ten-year-old
cross this?

13:07.743 --> 13:10.224
It was winter 30 years ago.

13:10.267 --> 13:14.010
Uh, with less global warming,
it would have been frozen over.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.405
There's got to be a
way around it, right?

13:17.448 --> 13:20.800
Mm. Well,
daylight's wasting.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.977
Sometimes the only way around it
is through.

13:24.020 --> 13:27.067
Come on. Roll your pants up.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.460
Gonna get muddy.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.914
Astrological Soul Mapping.
Nope.

13:47.957 --> 13:51.787
Demonic and Astral Regression,
Part 2.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.833
There's a part one?

13:53.876 --> 13:55.660
Hey, you having any luck?

13:56.661 --> 13:57.924
Hello?

13:57.967 --> 13:59.055
You're supposed
to be helping me,

13:59.099 --> 14:00.796
not stalking Addy's
dating profile.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.624
Uh, wasn't stalking.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.713
She updated her bio,
and I was just curious.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.368
Okay, why don't I
just ask her out again for you?No.

14:07.411 --> 14:08.630
Don't you dare.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.545
What if she doesn't reciprocate?Well,

14:10.588 --> 14:12.199
that's just a fact of life,
then, Bess.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.766
Death, taxes, rejection.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.073
Hmm.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.683
Oh, my God.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.425
Have you never
experienced rejection?

14:21.469 --> 14:22.731
[chuckles]:
Okay, you're saying it

14:22.774 --> 14:24.733
like I care about Addy. I don't.Right.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.561
All I care about right now
is untangling your soul

14:26.604 --> 14:28.650
from Odette's.Right.

14:28.693 --> 14:32.828
So, think I might
have found something.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.787
It's a footnote.
Says, "The DÃ­az Case:

14:35.831 --> 14:38.399
"A 46-year-old woman
in Buenos Aires

14:38.442 --> 14:39.617
"alleged to be entwined

14:39.661 --> 14:41.750
"with the spirit
of a deceased nun,

14:41.793 --> 14:43.491
"causing the subject
to sleepwalk

14:43.534 --> 14:45.928
and commit crimes
she was unaware of."

14:45.972 --> 14:48.713
Does that sound
like someone you know?

14:50.498 --> 14:52.587
It says, "Subject was healed

14:52.630 --> 14:54.806
"by a rigorous,
three-day release ritual

14:54.850 --> 14:56.547
and prayer of liberation."

14:57.331 --> 14:58.680
Damn.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.029
Why didn't Hannah
point us towards this case

15:00.073 --> 15:01.378
when I asked her?You know,

15:01.422 --> 15:03.815
we were keeping her busy.
Saving Nancy from dying

15:03.859 --> 15:05.600
and a parasitic Wraith,
et cetera.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.645
Well, who wrote the book? Maybe
they have the answers for me.

15:07.689 --> 15:11.301
BESS:
It was written by Father Shane.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.348
The-the priest who sold us the
holy water for Larkspur Lane.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.002
And there's an inscription

15:16.045 --> 15:17.351
dedicated to Hannah.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.482
"Dearest Hannah,

15:18.526 --> 15:20.006
"I was inspired by you
to write this

15:20.049 --> 15:21.355
"after our last talk.

15:21.398 --> 15:22.660
"I wish we'd had more time,

15:22.704 --> 15:24.227
"and I hope
whenever you read this,

15:24.271 --> 15:26.447
"you'll think of me.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.753
Yours truly, Jonathan."

15:28.797 --> 15:30.451
How lovely.Okay.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.322
Is it me, or does it look
like Father Shane

15:32.366 --> 15:33.889
had the hots for Hannah?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.195
Let's hope so.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.848
Because that's
how we're gonna get him here.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.807
Mm-hmm.

15:43.725 --> 15:47.120
The "X" marks the
creepy, abandoned house.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.992
Looks like no one's
lived here for decades.

15:50.036 --> 15:54.127
Yeah, we can get in through
that window over there.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.173
Wait. Oh, wait. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

15:57.217 --> 15:58.696
Before we go
destroying property,

15:58.740 --> 15:59.828
maybe we can just spend

15:59.871 --> 16:02.048
30 seconds and-and look around.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.311
You know?
We might find a way in.Okay,

16:04.354 --> 16:05.703
you're the one
who wanted to know

16:05.747 --> 16:06.835
what I was like
when I was younger.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.576
This is a pretty good example.

16:08.619 --> 16:11.796
Hey, Nancy! I
found something!

16:11.840 --> 16:13.885
[sighs]

16:17.063 --> 16:18.368
Hey, check this out.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.761
Whoa!

16:19.804 --> 16:21.328
[gasps]
Oh, my God, Ryan!

16:25.941 --> 16:29.771
Ryan?RYAN:Yeah!

16:29.814 --> 16:32.121
Down here! [groans]NANCY:
Okay, I'm coming!

16:32.165 --> 16:34.428
RYAN:
Okay. [panting]

16:34.471 --> 16:35.690
[groans, grunts]

16:35.733 --> 16:37.474
Are you okay?Yeah, yeah.

16:37.518 --> 16:40.782
Okay, good. At least you didn't
land on your shoulder first!Yeah.

16:40.825 --> 16:44.003
[groaning]Here, let me
see. Let me see.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.483
Okay. Let me see.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.746
[grunting]

16:48.790 --> 16:51.053
It's dislocated, and the
pain's gonna be a lot worse

16:51.097 --> 16:52.489
if I don't reset
it now, okay?Okay.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.056
Wait, what?
You know how to do that?

16:54.100 --> 16:56.058
I actually have a
question for you.Yeah? What?

16:56.102 --> 16:59.105
Have you been outsourcing
the chore wheel to Ace?What?

16:59.148 --> 17:00.323
[bones crack]Ow!

17:00.367 --> 17:02.586
Oh! Oh. Oh.

17:02.630 --> 17:05.024
Oh, that-that feels better.Okay. All right.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.808
[panting]You need some
medical attention,

17:06.851 --> 17:08.679
so I think we should
just go back up,

17:08.723 --> 17:10.812
uh, and-and try and
get some help, okay?No.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.292
No, that-that's gonna be
a challenge.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.729
We can't go up that way.
We got to find another way out.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.948
Plus now you can, you
can find your-your hat killer's

17:16.992 --> 17:18.211
hideout like you wanted to.

17:18.254 --> 17:20.778
[grunting]Here.

17:24.956 --> 17:26.175
Thank you.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.090
So how about
that chore wheel, huh?

17:28.134 --> 17:30.614
I'm not gonna answer that.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.272
When will Hannah
be joining us?

17:36.316 --> 17:38.579
Uh, she'll be here,
uh, in a minute.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.581
But she wanted us to get
started, please, um...

17:40.624 --> 17:42.365
take a seat.Oh, thank you.

17:42.409 --> 17:44.759
Uh, yeah, we've heard
all about your expertise

17:44.802 --> 17:47.109
in soul entwinement,
so who better

17:47.153 --> 17:49.285
to be our interview subject

17:49.329 --> 17:51.374
of this month's
newsletter focusing

17:51.418 --> 17:52.941
on possessions?

17:52.984 --> 17:55.639
I didn't know
she published a newsletter.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.251
Oh, your writings
gave her the idea.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.296
Ah.
So...

18:00.340 --> 18:03.125
the... release ritual

18:03.169 --> 18:06.259
and prayer of liberation that
you mentioned in your book...

18:06.302 --> 18:08.348
what is that
about exactly?

18:08.391 --> 18:10.263
Hannah knows the answer to that.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.700
That's the reason
we stopped speaking.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.790
I'm surprised she'd want
to interview me on the topic.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.705
Where did you say
she went again?

18:17.748 --> 18:19.837
Uh, she just had to do
a bit of research...

18:19.881 --> 18:21.665
Okay, look, forget Hannah.

18:21.709 --> 18:22.840
Give me this.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.755
Hannah's not coming.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.453
I have the spirit
of an old French lady

18:26.496 --> 18:28.672
trapped inside me,
and my lifeline got cut short.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.805
Do you know of anything
that could excavate a soul

18:30.848 --> 18:32.676
from a person's body
permanently?

18:34.548 --> 18:37.159
How familiar are you
with the, uh, concept

18:37.203 --> 18:38.987
of exorcism?

18:39.030 --> 18:41.337
You'd be surprised.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.472
Many believed that...

18:45.515 --> 18:48.301
aberrant behavior was caused
by demonic corruption

18:48.344 --> 18:50.390
of human souls.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.957
To combat that,
ritualists created

18:53.001 --> 18:55.917
a device called a soul-splitter.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.745
Okay, so can we use this
soul-splitter on George?

18:57.788 --> 19:00.748
To-to split off the French ghost
that's tethered to her soul

19:00.791 --> 19:03.229
and-and restore
George's natural life span?

19:03.272 --> 19:05.666
When the clergy discovered that
the soul-splitter was created

19:05.709 --> 19:07.537
through dark magic...

19:07.581 --> 19:09.887
all of the devices
were banished.

19:09.931 --> 19:13.326
All the soul-splitters were
destroyed in the early 1800s.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.328
But some must have survived
somewhere.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.504
Your book talks
about soul liberations

19:17.547 --> 19:19.288
in-in modern times.

19:19.332 --> 19:20.898
There were reports
of soul-splitters

19:20.942 --> 19:22.335
in the Civil War era.

19:22.378 --> 19:25.207
A metalsmith
named Beckett Dow

19:25.251 --> 19:27.035
designed his own version,
with the help

19:27.078 --> 19:29.037
of occult practitioners.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.821
Like a knockoff purse.
Hmm.

19:30.865 --> 19:33.433
Okay, so-so how do we find
one of these knockoffs?

19:33.476 --> 19:36.218
Any soul-splitter
that exists today

19:36.262 --> 19:39.265
was not designed
to untangle souls.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.745
The device wasn't called
a soul-untangler.

19:41.789 --> 19:44.052
With or without it,
I am dead anyway.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.836
So, Father Shane, please...

19:45.880 --> 19:48.012
if you know where one
of these knockoffs are,

19:48.056 --> 19:50.798
just tell me! Please.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.803
The last one

19:55.846 --> 19:58.545
was in a private art collection
in New Hampshire.

19:58.588 --> 20:01.678
I wrote about
this collection.

20:01.722 --> 20:04.420
Unfortunately,
the books attracted

20:04.464 --> 20:07.554
the attention of black-market
operatives

20:07.597 --> 20:10.209
who targeted those objects.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.690
The entire collection
was stolen.

20:15.039 --> 20:17.216
Hannah never forgave me

20:17.259 --> 20:19.783
for writing those books.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.308
And... no one...

20:22.351 --> 20:24.832
knows where the soul-splitter
went after that?

20:24.875 --> 20:26.747
That's a blessing.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.316
Trust me.

20:30.359 --> 20:33.057
Tell Hannah I warned you away

20:33.101 --> 20:35.190
from a very dangerous relic.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.367
I know she'd want
to keep you both safe.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.552
Stolen for the black market?

20:49.596 --> 20:52.076
Bess, how are we gonna
find this thing?

20:52.120 --> 20:53.861
I might have a lead.

20:53.904 --> 20:55.558
Okay?

20:57.734 --> 20:59.258
[line ringing]

20:59.301 --> 21:01.564
Hey, Bess.Hi!

21:01.608 --> 21:03.523
George needs
a supernatural relic,

21:03.566 --> 21:05.829
uh, that was used
during the Civil War

21:05.873 --> 21:07.657
and stolen
by black-market traffickers.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.877
I don't suppose you came
across a soul-splitter

21:09.920 --> 21:11.661
in your journey
to the Bobbsey dark side?

21:11.705 --> 21:14.360
No, but Mr. D said that the guys

21:14.403 --> 21:17.014
who got arrested the other night
had some relics seized,

21:17.058 --> 21:19.278
so I can ask him
to keep an eye out.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.236
I got to call you back.Okay.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.499
Thanks.Mm-hmm.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.676
Hey... everything okay?

21:27.721 --> 21:29.505
George needs a
soul-splitter.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.899
Some kind of relic
from the Civil War.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.901
But that's a problem
for another time.

21:33.944 --> 21:36.512
How was the Camino
de Santiago?

21:36.556 --> 21:38.514
Ah, transcendent.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.342
You would've loved it.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.126
Should've came with me.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.867
Yeah, I should have.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.869
Hey, what's wrong?

21:45.913 --> 21:49.133
Is it about whatever you wanted
to tell me over coffee?

21:51.658 --> 21:54.138
Does it have something
to do with my dad?

21:56.967 --> 21:58.882
While you were gone, I started

21:58.926 --> 22:01.232
doing some small favors for him.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.365
Like giving him rides,
that kind of thing.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.236
Why?

22:05.280 --> 22:07.630
[children clamoring nearby]

22:07.674 --> 22:09.719
'Cause he asked, and...

22:09.763 --> 22:13.549
it's a way for me to
stay connected with you.

22:14.898 --> 22:17.118
The story doesn't
end well.

22:18.815 --> 22:21.122
Yeah, none of his stories do.

22:21.165 --> 22:24.560
He assaulted someone,
and then, as it turns out,

22:24.604 --> 22:28.259
I was with him at
the scene of the crime.

22:28.303 --> 22:31.088
So now he's
a fugitive.

22:31.132 --> 22:34.396
And if you get him arrested,
you're off the hook?

22:34.440 --> 22:36.485
Amanda, your dad is...

22:36.529 --> 22:38.922
A repeat offender
who belongs in jail?

22:39.923 --> 22:41.229
Maybe.

22:41.272 --> 22:44.101
But he's also the guy
who spoon-fed me soup

22:44.145 --> 22:46.190
when I had pneumonia.

22:46.234 --> 22:47.540
The guy who taught Gil and I

22:47.583 --> 22:49.063
that we're just
as smart and worthy

22:49.106 --> 22:51.979
as anyone else even though
we lived in a trailer.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.811
I don't know where he is.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.858
If I did, I wouldn't tell you.

23:04.165 --> 23:06.210
Sorry I asked.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.214
You should've come to Spain.

23:12.826 --> 23:15.306
NANCY:
These look like mining tunnels.

23:15.350 --> 23:19.441
RYAN:
Were these on a map
of the town yet?

23:19.485 --> 23:22.139
Well, I didn't ask
for the subterranean part.

23:41.507 --> 23:42.986
Okay.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.467
Here's something I never thought
I was gonna have to ask,

23:45.511 --> 23:48.688
but which way to
the monster cage?

23:52.692 --> 23:55.651
Hey, we might be close, look.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.305
RYAN:
Yeah.

23:57.348 --> 23:59.394
NANCY:
I wonder if Trott
left these here

23:59.438 --> 24:01.657
when he came to visit the cage.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.579
Oh, my God.

24:11.711 --> 24:13.495
Okay, take as many
pictures as you can.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.280
And then, uh, grab anything
you can fit in your pockets.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.282
Okay.

24:19.719 --> 24:21.938
Wow, the-the cage held.

24:21.982 --> 24:23.897
None of the bars
are broken.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.681
Well, how'd this thing get out?

24:25.725 --> 24:27.988
Monster picka lock?

24:36.213 --> 24:39.565
I found a...
I found a part of a key.

24:45.745 --> 24:48.225
Someone released the monster.

24:48.269 --> 24:50.358
But who?

24:50.401 --> 24:53.013
[camera clicking]

24:56.190 --> 24:58.235
[exhales]

25:02.022 --> 25:04.285
Hey, these tracks look new.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.767
Look at this.

25:10.465 --> 25:13.207
Looks like blood,
maybe a day or two old.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.427
I was wrong-- this thing's
been coming back to the cage

25:16.471 --> 25:19.256
ever since it got out.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.345
We need to hurry.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.916
Huh.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.054
[whispering voices]

25:45.892 --> 25:47.850
[Ryan exhales]

25:47.894 --> 25:49.678
What's that?!

25:49.722 --> 25:52.115
Hang on,
I'll get the flashlight.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.816
[screams]
Run!

25:56.859 --> 25:58.295
[panting, whimpering]

26:04.563 --> 26:06.608
Go! Go! Go!

26:06.652 --> 26:08.828
[monster growling]

26:11.091 --> 26:13.484
[panting]

26:20.274 --> 26:21.580
It's a dead end!

26:21.623 --> 26:24.583
[growling]

26:43.558 --> 26:46.474
He wants the doll.

26:46.517 --> 26:49.564
So give it to him.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.312
Go! Go! Go!

26:58.355 --> 27:00.053
[panting]
Are you okay?

27:00.096 --> 27:02.142
Yeah.Why did you have that doll?

27:02.185 --> 27:03.970
Because I thought that
Hannah might need it

27:04.013 --> 27:05.798
to figure out
its origin story.

27:05.841 --> 27:07.756
That thing had
a chance to kill us,

27:07.800 --> 27:10.019
and it didn't want either of us,
so what does that mean?

27:10.063 --> 27:12.239
Let's not stay and find out,
come on.

27:20.551 --> 27:23.511
AMANDA:
Dad?

27:23.554 --> 27:25.774
Panda Bear?

27:27.080 --> 27:29.560
Is that you?

27:31.562 --> 27:33.869
[Bobbsey chuckles]

27:35.262 --> 27:37.612
[whispers]: You always
know how to find me.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.571
Thought you might be
running low.

27:45.272 --> 27:48.101
Bet the cops had
a lot of questions for you.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.495
You didn't tell anyone
where I was, did you?

27:51.539 --> 27:53.323
No.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.152
I came because I wanted
to see you.

27:57.371 --> 27:59.590
That's my girl.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.725
That's a lot of protein bars.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.988
Provisions for two.

28:07.076 --> 28:09.296
I'm hitting the water tomorrow--
you want to come along?

28:11.124 --> 28:13.300
No.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.737
Look, Dad, I-I...

28:15.781 --> 28:17.565
I was hoping that...

28:17.608 --> 28:19.610
maybe you would come with me?

28:21.090 --> 28:23.919
I don't think I care for the
destination you have in mind.

28:23.963 --> 28:26.922
But it's where
you're gonna end up.

28:26.966 --> 28:29.098
There or worse, and...

28:29.142 --> 28:32.058
and I was thinking that,
that if you do the time, then...

28:32.101 --> 28:33.755
You want me to turn myself in?

28:33.799 --> 28:35.801
If you cooperate,
you'll get a shorter sentence.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.890
And when you're out,
we can be a family again.

28:37.933 --> 28:40.109
We're already a family.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.984
Look, it's a, it's a full moon.

28:45.027 --> 28:47.551
Let's not wait
till morning to go.

28:47.595 --> 28:50.641
Bring my boat around to the dock
and I'll meet you there, okay?

28:54.123 --> 28:56.735
If you don't help me, who will?

28:59.563 --> 29:01.348
[sighs]

29:02.697 --> 29:04.307
ACE:
Amanda, wait!

29:04.351 --> 29:05.787
[sirens wailing]

29:05.831 --> 29:07.615
You set me up?

29:07.658 --> 29:08.964
No, I-I swear.

29:11.924 --> 29:14.143
[indistinct radio chatter]

29:18.626 --> 29:20.933
You followed me?

29:22.151 --> 29:23.762
He played you!

29:28.244 --> 29:30.159
Bertram Bobbsey,
I have a warrant

29:30.203 --> 29:32.901
for your arrest.
I thought
you were smarter than this!

29:37.036 --> 29:38.864
Me, too.

29:41.388 --> 29:43.346
You have the right
to remain silent.

29:43.390 --> 29:44.783
Anything you
say can...

29:46.785 --> 29:48.308
Maybe we should
retrace our steps,

29:48.351 --> 29:50.049
go back up the
way we came in?

29:50.092 --> 29:52.355
But there...
there is no way

29:52.399 --> 29:54.836
that that thing fits
through the crawl space.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.144
It has to be going
in and out some other way.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.407
Wait.

30:06.761 --> 30:09.329
I saw moths.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.157
So...

30:11.200 --> 30:14.900
they'd be coming through
an entirely different entrance.

30:20.383 --> 30:22.864
Someone put this here.

30:24.561 --> 30:26.563
Wait, wait, wait, wait--
are we, are we sure

30:26.607 --> 30:29.001
that, that there's
not something worse up above?

30:29.044 --> 30:31.307
I'm never sure of that.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.885
[door creaks][Nancy grunts]

30:46.409 --> 30:48.107
Whoa.

31:01.337 --> 31:04.079
RYAN:
This feels like an escape room.

31:06.777 --> 31:08.997
NANCY:
Hold that thought.

31:10.042 --> 31:12.261
[door creaks open]

31:20.791 --> 31:23.142
[gasps]

31:23.185 --> 31:25.144
George?

31:27.102 --> 31:29.409
You see them, too, right?

31:37.983 --> 31:40.115
Just spoke with
D.A. Rosario.

31:40.159 --> 31:43.075
She has agreed
to full immunity

31:43.118 --> 31:45.729
for your part in getting
Bertram Bobbsey arrested.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.949
You're in the clear.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.212
Thank you.

31:51.257 --> 31:53.302
Hey, um...

31:53.346 --> 31:56.305
the other night when the cops
busted those relic traffickers?

31:56.349 --> 31:59.656
Mm-hmm.Was there anything
called a soul-splitter

31:59.700 --> 32:01.963
in the stuff
that they confiscated?

32:02.007 --> 32:03.791
Uh...

32:03.834 --> 32:06.533
I don't remember seeing
that on the exhibit list.

32:07.882 --> 32:09.884
A friend is doing some research.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.060
Don't worry about it.

32:12.104 --> 32:14.541
Your dad wanted to take a look

32:14.584 --> 32:17.109
at the wording of your deal.

32:25.595 --> 32:27.336
Captain.

32:37.085 --> 32:39.653
Yeah, Mom thinks
that I'm not eating.

32:58.019 --> 33:02.067
Thank you, but...

33:02.110 --> 33:04.417
I'm looking for another job.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.550
So-so really I'm,
I'm good, I'm okay.

33:20.302 --> 33:22.652
I won't disappoint her.

33:35.491 --> 33:37.667
[crickets chirping]

33:38.973 --> 33:40.627
We're gonna need more furniture.

33:40.670 --> 33:43.369
Then it just kind
of sniffed the air...

33:43.412 --> 33:45.806
and decided
to leave us alone.

33:45.849 --> 33:48.113
Guess our hearts didn't smell
good enough to freeze.

33:48.156 --> 33:49.766
NANCY:
My takeaway was...

33:49.810 --> 33:51.203
it doesn't kill at random.

33:51.246 --> 33:53.205
It-it has some sort
of hard-wiring

33:53.248 --> 33:55.294
that dictates who it murders
and who it doesn't.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.122
So how is it finding
its victims, then?

33:57.165 --> 33:58.645
They must have
something in common, right?

33:58.688 --> 34:01.082
There's one other thing.

34:01.126 --> 34:04.346
So the supernatural killer has
some sort of attachment

34:04.390 --> 34:06.696
to this doll.
It was laser-focused

34:06.740 --> 34:08.742
on it, it clearly
wanted it back.

34:08.785 --> 34:11.614
And it was the same doll
in the vision with Trott.

34:11.658 --> 34:14.313
And Temperance had
a really weird reaction to it.

34:14.356 --> 34:16.054
Like she
recognized it.

34:16.097 --> 34:17.838
So that means Temperance was
the one who let the killer out?

34:17.881 --> 34:19.709
No, no, no, sh-she
wouldn't do that.

34:19.753 --> 34:22.103
Oh, what, she draws the line
at bathing in blood?

34:22.147 --> 34:23.887
I'm still trying to wrap
my mind around tunnels

34:23.931 --> 34:25.976
being connected
to the Historical Society.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.588
I mean, did Hannah ever mention
a secret door being in the wall?

34:28.631 --> 34:30.329
No, not to me, she didn't.

34:30.372 --> 34:31.939
What if this thing's
being unleashed

34:31.982 --> 34:33.767
by coming up through
the Historical Society?

34:33.810 --> 34:35.334
You know, I mean, like we did?

34:35.377 --> 34:37.205
I set up surveillance cameras
all over this building.

34:37.249 --> 34:38.685
We can see
who's been coming and going.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.382
Let's start with the most
recent surveillance footage,

34:40.426 --> 34:41.905
and then work our way
backwards from there.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.168
Great.

34:43.211 --> 34:45.170
[distant siren wailing]

34:45.213 --> 34:47.650
[indistinct radio chatter]

34:47.694 --> 34:49.739
[sighs]

34:51.654 --> 34:53.787
I know that I'm probably
the last person

34:53.830 --> 34:55.267
you want
to see right now.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.572
I wouldn't say that.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.052
I was glad to see you
at the boatyard tonight.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.272
You were?Yeah.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.752
I knew you'd follow me
and get my dad arrested.

35:02.796 --> 35:05.015
If I had to turn him in myself,
he'd never forgive me.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.800
Now he's safe,
and he doesn't hate me.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.497
Okay, well, I would still like
to explain to you

35:08.541 --> 35:09.672
why I did what I did.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.631
Yeah, I bet
you would.

35:13.546 --> 35:16.201
This is a key
to my dad's storage locker.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.420
There's a million things
in there that he's

35:18.464 --> 35:20.814
stolen, traded, or hoarded.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.773
There's a ton
of Civil War stuff in there.

35:23.817 --> 35:26.907
Cross street's Pinecrest
and Greenview, number nine.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.692
What, is this for the case?

35:29.736 --> 35:31.172
No. It's for George.

35:31.216 --> 35:34.088
You said she's looking
for a soul-splitter.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.785
If my dad ever had
a relic like that,

35:35.829 --> 35:37.526
it'd be in his
storage locker.

35:37.570 --> 35:39.485
I really appreciate this.

35:39.528 --> 35:43.053
I'm paying my brother's
karmic debt.

35:43.097 --> 35:46.361
Since Gil wanted to use a shroud
that would've killed George.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.973
Now the Bobbseys are even.

35:50.931 --> 35:54.108
Amanda...
no-nobody's keeping score.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.371
If they weren't keeping score,
you would've trusted me

35:56.415 --> 35:59.244
to make the right choice
tonight, but instead...

36:01.507 --> 36:04.379
...you made that choice for me.

36:05.772 --> 36:07.904
You know what
your problem is?

36:07.948 --> 36:11.430
You always think
that you're the good guy.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.915
Can we... talk about this?

36:18.959 --> 36:20.003
No.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.051
Ace, we're done.

36:25.444 --> 36:26.793
Amanda...

36:26.836 --> 36:28.882
Goodbye.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.284
How's it going in here?

36:39.327 --> 36:41.503
Oh, we just went
through the security footage

36:41.547 --> 36:42.852
the night
Jake Cazine was murdered,

36:42.896 --> 36:45.246
and nobody came in or out

36:45.290 --> 36:48.031
through that wall panel.Let's go back farther.

36:48.075 --> 36:51.121
[sighs deeply]

36:52.862 --> 36:54.255
[gasps]Oh, my God.
[chuckles]

36:54.299 --> 36:56.605
Well, well, well.Uh,

36:56.649 --> 36:58.477
why don't I just take over
for a bit, yeah?

36:58.520 --> 37:00.609
[chuckles]Yeah. Uh, just call us

37:00.653 --> 37:03.438
whenever you see
something suspicious.Yeah.

37:03.482 --> 37:04.657
About the case.Got it.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.050
Uh, supernatural entity.
Wears a big hat.

37:07.094 --> 37:08.748
Won't miss it.

37:08.791 --> 37:12.055
Oh, my God.[door closes]

37:12.099 --> 37:13.970
Bess...

37:14.014 --> 37:17.060
take it from a girl who only has
ten years left to live.

37:17.104 --> 37:18.453
Risk the rejection.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.716
You and Addy deserve more
than a one-night stand.

37:20.760 --> 37:24.242
[chuckles softly] Meaning
that if you can face down death,

37:24.285 --> 37:27.245
then maybe I can initiate
a second date?

37:27.288 --> 37:30.248
She'd be crazy to say no.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.337
Oh, God.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.600
["The Crooked Kind"
by Radical Face playing]

37:38.952 --> 37:40.258
How's the arm?

37:40.301 --> 37:43.435
You know,
I can probably rock a sling.Yeah?

37:44.305 --> 37:46.307
Still glad I came, though.

37:46.351 --> 37:49.005
Oh, you have
a weird sense of fun.

37:50.006 --> 37:51.399
For what it's worth,

37:51.443 --> 37:55.316
Carson never dislocated
his shoulder for me.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.622
Oh, cool.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.667
'Cause I need all the dad points
I can get.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.843
I mean,
he also never fell down a hole,

38:00.887 --> 38:03.411
so...[grunts, chuckles]

38:03.455 --> 38:06.109
[knock on door][door opens]

38:06.153 --> 38:08.286
Hey.Hey.

38:08.329 --> 38:09.983
Got the group text.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.290
You okay?

38:15.118 --> 38:16.859
Undecided.

38:16.903 --> 38:18.557
â™ª Simple hands

38:18.600 --> 38:20.950
â™ª Some walk
the common paths... â™ª

38:20.994 --> 38:22.648
Hey.

38:22.691 --> 38:23.997
Hey.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.956
â™ª But all folks
are damaged goods... â™ª

38:27.000 --> 38:29.350
Um...

38:29.394 --> 38:31.700
I wanted to apologize to you.

38:31.744 --> 38:33.789
â™ª When and how...

38:33.833 --> 38:38.577
For accusing me
of bad vacuum maintenance?

38:38.620 --> 38:40.143
[scoffs softly]
No.

38:40.187 --> 38:43.712
For holding on to our argument
this morning.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.366
â™ª Go scratch your name
into the clouds... â™ª

38:45.410 --> 38:47.368
I was still a little mad
from last night

38:47.412 --> 38:48.891
because you...

38:48.935 --> 38:52.155
kind of called me out
on not sharing things.

38:52.199 --> 38:54.854
I was worried
it was becoming a pattern.

38:54.897 --> 38:57.509
Okay, well, you know, sometimes
you don't share things, either.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.815
Like how you've never been back
to visit Florida,

38:59.859 --> 39:02.731
not even once, since you
came to Horseshoe Bay.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.561
Look, my point is,

39:06.605 --> 39:08.476
I don't pressure you
to talk about things

39:08.520 --> 39:10.043
that you're not ready to share.

39:10.086 --> 39:14.352
And yes, I was going to ask
you to try my approach,

39:14.395 --> 39:16.441
but after I had some time
to think

39:16.484 --> 39:18.834
and because of
some new discoveries,

39:18.878 --> 39:22.795
I decided that I'm going to try
your approach

39:22.838 --> 39:25.232
and share things instead.

39:25.275 --> 39:29.410
Okay, firstly, I-I wasn't trying
to pressure you before.

39:29.454 --> 39:33.414
I just... I just wanted
to feel connected to you.Nick,

39:33.458 --> 39:35.851
we areconnected.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.812
It means a lot
to hear you say that.

39:39.855 --> 39:42.031
â™ª The thunder
plays its drum... â™ª

39:42.075 --> 39:44.425
And second,

39:44.469 --> 39:46.862
what new discoveries?

39:46.906 --> 39:49.865
Okay. So...

39:49.909 --> 39:52.868
Bess and I spent the whole
day looking for a cure

39:52.912 --> 39:54.566
to get Odette's
soul out of me.

39:54.609 --> 39:58.047
And now I am finally ready
to tell you.

39:58.091 --> 40:00.528
We found an actual lead.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.401
That's amazing.

40:03.444 --> 40:05.446
Uh-huh.
[laughs]

40:05.490 --> 40:07.405
[laughs]

40:07.448 --> 40:09.450
A-And...
[clears throat]

40:09.494 --> 40:12.105
Here's something
I'm ready to tell you.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.456
I admire

40:15.500 --> 40:19.199
that you had the guts
to go face your biological dad.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.463
And I hope

40:22.507 --> 40:25.118
some of that
could rub off on me.

40:27.686 --> 40:30.515
And that's what I should've said
last night.

40:30.558 --> 40:32.560
Or this morning.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.954
Or any time since then.

40:34.997 --> 40:38.131
I think I'm ready
to stop fighting now.

40:43.310 --> 40:46.269
Oh, my God! You're never gonna
believe this. Oh, my God!

40:46.313 --> 40:47.706
Oh, my God!

40:47.749 --> 40:50.012
Okay. Okay,
this footage was dated

40:50.056 --> 40:53.755
one night after our meeting
with Myrtle/Temperance Hudson.

40:53.799 --> 40:56.149
The-the night
of the weird blackouts.BESS: Yeah. Watch.

40:56.192 --> 41:00.632
There's Hannah
in this very room.

41:02.416 --> 41:04.636
The blackout happens.

41:05.724 --> 41:08.640
She-she takes a key out.

41:10.424 --> 41:12.644
And look where she goes.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.777
GEORGE:
Hannah knew about the door.

41:15.821 --> 41:18.780
I found this
in the underground prison cell.

41:18.824 --> 41:21.827
Play that first part again.

41:36.842 --> 41:39.671
That's part of the key that
unlocked the monster's cage.

41:39.714 --> 41:42.804
All this time,
I thought that Hannah

41:42.848 --> 41:45.111
was gonna help us protect
the town.

41:45.154 --> 41:48.288
But she's the one who released
the supernatural killer.
