WEBVTT

00:07.220 --> 00:08.553
What?

00:08.553 --> 00:10.095
No, I didn't steal this shit.

00:10.095 --> 00:12.011
If you bothered to watch
last week's episode,

00:12.011 --> 00:13.470
you'd know that.

00:15.261 --> 00:16.679
Police!

00:16.679 --> 00:18.720
Police!

00:18.720 --> 00:20.303
-  Jesus!

00:20.303 --> 00:21.887
- What the fuck, asshole?
- Shit!

00:21.887 --> 00:23.637
What the fuck

00:25.470 --> 00:26.553
Mikey?

00:26.553 --> 00:28.053
Frank.

00:28.053 --> 00:29.345
I deserve to feel special.

00:31.470 --> 00:33.136
Don't look at me like that.

00:33.136 --> 00:36.261
I've got a system.
It's all going back.

00:36.261 --> 00:37.970
You're a disgrace,
Gallagher.

00:37.970 --> 00:40.178
I never, ever want
to see your face again,

00:40.178 --> 00:43.261
not on my campus
and not ever in my army.

00:43.261 --> 00:44.136
We clear, son?

00:44.136 --> 00:45.428
Crystal, sir.

00:47.887 --> 00:49.887
Boy or girl?

00:49.887 --> 00:51.970
-  Boy.
-  Tami?

00:51.970 --> 00:55.220
We don't know yet.
She's still in surgery.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

02:19.804 --> 02:21.553
Hey, any of those
glazed doughnut holes

02:21.553 --> 02:23.345
left down in the break room?

02:23.345 --> 02:24.595
Mm-hmm.

02:45.387 --> 02:50.011
Mm.

02:50.011 --> 02:51.595
Hey.

03:14.970 --> 03:18.053
Ugh!
Get the fuck off me!

03:19.553 --> 03:21.303
What's your problem?

03:21.303 --> 03:22.220
I'm sick of the smell
of goddamn mayonnaise.

03:22.220 --> 03:23.512
It's like getting screwed

03:23.512 --> 03:25.095
by a bowl of potato salad
every morning.

03:25.095 --> 03:27.136
It's the only lube
we have in this shithole.

03:27.136 --> 03:29.345
Well, it makes me wanna gag
every time you come near me.

03:29.345 --> 03:31.220
Oh, yeah, 'cause you taking
a shit every night at 8:15

03:31.220 --> 03:33.387
is a real fuckin' bed of roses.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.053
At least my shit
gets flushed,

03:35.053 --> 03:36.887
unlike your
coleslaw-smellin' dick.

03:36.887 --> 03:39.303
Can't be 8:30, can it?
Or seven o'clock?

03:39.303 --> 03:41.261
No, Mickey has to shit
every night

03:41.261 --> 03:42.470
at the exact same time.

03:42.470 --> 03:43.679
That's annoying.

03:43.679 --> 03:44.929
-  Shut up!
-  Is it?

03:44.929 --> 03:46.804
Is it as annoying as the way
you lick your finger

03:46.804 --> 03:48.595
every single time
you turn the page

03:48.595 --> 03:50.095
of whatever faggety-ass
book you're reading?

03:50.095 --> 03:51.595
- Okay.
- "My name's Ian.

03:51.595 --> 03:53.595
I can't turn the page
like a normal human being.

03:53.595 --> 03:55.595
I have to put my whole
goddamn paw in my mouth."

03:55.595 --> 03:57.512
You know what? If you
actually knew how to read,

03:57.512 --> 03:59.762
maybe you'd understand,
not, "Look at these fucking

03:59.762 --> 04:02.261
squiggle-dings all over
this piece of paper!"

04:02.261 --> 04:03.929
Every morning,
the same shit!

04:03.929 --> 04:05.595
You're like old women!

04:05.595 --> 04:07.595
I came to prison
to get  away  from my parents.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.679
Eat my cornhole, cocks!

04:09.679 --> 04:11.512
Not if it smells
like mayonnaise.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.970
- Exactly!

04:13.970 --> 04:16.303
Let's go! Line it up!

04:20.595 --> 04:22.512
Hey.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.470
I wanna see the warden
about getting a new roommate.

04:24.470 --> 04:26.095
What is this,
fuckin' summer camp?

04:26.095 --> 04:28.095
Get your ass to breakfast.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.345
Hey, we made it, huh?

05:16.345 --> 05:17.720
No problem.

05:29.845 --> 05:31.720
Asses up
if you want coffee!

05:38.595 --> 05:40.720
You start bonin' dudes
while I was away at school?

05:40.720 --> 05:44.011
Occasionally,
if the mood strikes.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.345
I was talkin' to Frank.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.720
Can't two grown men
share a bed together

05:47.720 --> 05:49.220
without it being sexual?

05:49.220 --> 05:51.804
- No.

05:53.637 --> 05:55.387
Go for Carl.

05:55.387 --> 05:56.720
Yeah, yeah,
it's still available.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.679
All right.
I'll send you the address.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.720
Stinky, dirty, wet!

06:03.720 --> 06:06.136
Wash your own shit!

06:06.136 --> 06:07.720
You both owe me
rent money.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.136
Oh, come on.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.387
Thirty-seven bucks a night,

06:10.387 --> 06:12.220
plus five if you'll be
showering.

06:12.220 --> 06:14.595
- What about Carl?
- I'm selling my military gear

06:14.595 --> 06:16.387
- to get some cash.
-  Electricity, gas,

06:16.387 --> 06:18.303
and water for the month
is 48 bucks.

06:18.303 --> 06:20.053
Let me know
if you'll be eating here.

06:20.053 --> 06:22.512
I have various
meal plans available.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.804
You don't need
to pay rent, Frank.

06:24.804 --> 06:26.970
You're the patriarch
of this family.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.762
He is?

06:28.762 --> 06:30.595
I'm keeping the
coffee warm for ten minutes.

06:30.595 --> 06:32.178
Then I'm dumping it.

06:32.178 --> 06:33.679
- Little Red Riding Twat

06:33.679 --> 06:36.845
needs to understand
who's boss around here.

06:36.845 --> 06:38.428
Me?

06:38.428 --> 06:41.345
Yes, you.

06:52.553 --> 06:54.929
- What's goin' on?

06:54.929 --> 06:57.220
Tryin' to figure out
who I am,

06:57.220 --> 07:00.553
what's my identity
Dr. King, Dr. Dre?

07:00.553 --> 07:02.136
Maybe you should
set your sights lower,

07:02.136 --> 07:04.387
you know, like Tiga, Nelly,

07:04.387 --> 07:05.804
or maybe one
of the Wayans brothers.

07:05.804 --> 07:07.303
Or Lester Holt.

07:41.845 --> 07:44.428
- You Carl?
- Who's asking?

07:44.428 --> 07:46.303
I answered an ad
on Craigslist.

07:46.303 --> 07:48.345
Lookin' to buy
some military gear.

07:48.345 --> 07:50.095
- It's all right here.
- Cool.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.970
You take 75?

07:51.970 --> 07:53.178
Ad said 100.

07:53.178 --> 07:55.178
I figured I'd try.

07:55.178 --> 07:56.553
- Figured I'd walk away.
- Wait, no, no, no.

07:56.553 --> 07:57.845
Here, here.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.428
It's fine.
Hundred bucks.

08:01.303 --> 08:03.261
It's all there.
I promise.

08:03.261 --> 08:05.512
I'm starting ROTC
in the fall.

08:05.512 --> 08:06.845
- I gotta train this summer.
- Mm.

08:06.845 --> 08:08.679
So what got you interested
in becoming an officer?

08:08.679 --> 08:10.136
Went down
to the recruiting offices,

08:10.136 --> 08:11.345
played them shoot-'em-up
video games?

08:11.345 --> 08:13.887
Something like that.

08:13.887 --> 08:15.929
Can I have the bag?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.470
What, the recruiters
make you think

08:17.470 --> 08:18.637
you're gonna become
this officer,

08:18.637 --> 08:20.970
big war hero,
leading men into battle?

08:20.970 --> 08:22.762
I don't know. Maybe.
I guess.

08:22.762 --> 08:24.637
They tell you that you
could be one of the very few,

08:24.637 --> 08:25.970
make a difference,

08:25.970 --> 08:27.303
that you could
do something your life,

08:27.303 --> 08:28.637
change your destiny?

08:28.637 --> 08:30.679
Hey, might even become
a general one day.

08:30.679 --> 08:33.804
My mom's gonna start worrying
if I don't get home soon.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.720
You know that's a bunch
of horseshit.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.886
They don't want guys like us
to enlist as officers

08:37.886 --> 08:39.720
you know,
guys from the South Side,

08:39.720 --> 08:42.720
guys who aren't very smart,
kinda slow.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.595
They're just trying
to fill their quota,

08:44.595 --> 08:47.637
gettin' us hooked
on the thrill of the kill.

08:47.637 --> 08:49.345
Then they spit us out
when we can't handle

08:49.345 --> 08:51.387
quantum physics or even read.

08:51.387 --> 08:52.387
- I can read.
- And then they leave us

08:52.387 --> 08:53.387
on the side of the road

08:53.387 --> 08:55.095
with the taste of blood
in our mouths,

08:55.095 --> 08:56.136
and what do we do?

08:56.136 --> 08:57.804
We enlist as grunts.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.261
And while they get
all the medals

08:59.261 --> 09:01.720
and cushy postings
up in Japan and Germany,

09:01.720 --> 09:04.053
where are we, poor boys
from disadvantaged backgrounds

09:04.053 --> 09:05.720
like you and me?

09:05.720 --> 09:08.553
Somalia, Fallujah,
that's where.

09:08.553 --> 09:10.220
And then when we finally
get sent home,

09:10.220 --> 09:12.887
it's in a body bag.

09:12.887 --> 09:14.303
Not me.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.261
Not Carl Gallagher.
No, thank you.

09:16.261 --> 09:17.261
I ain't no one's
human shield.

09:17.261 --> 09:18.470
Can I just have my money back

09:18.470 --> 09:19.762
if you're not gonna
sell me the shit?

09:27.595 --> 09:30.845
Only thing left in these
Oxy bottles is dust.

09:30.845 --> 09:33.428
You have a toothbrush
I can use, Frank?

09:33.428 --> 09:35.679
They're communal.
Just grab one.

09:37.095 --> 09:39.387
The fuck is that?

09:43.679 --> 09:45.804
How 'bout we head over
to that Russian bakery

09:45.804 --> 09:48.929
and snag some of those muffin
samples for breakfast, huh?

09:48.929 --> 09:50.637
No can do, partner.

09:50.637 --> 09:53.136
We gotta hit the streets,
do some work.

09:53.136 --> 09:54.220
What? Why?

09:54.220 --> 09:56.178
You heard Debbie.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.553
- Rent money.
- You're not seriously gonna do

09:58.553 --> 10:00.679
what she told you to do,
are you?

10:00.679 --> 10:04.720
That girl's got a serious dose
of her mother's crazy DNA.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.720
We come home
with empty pockets,

10:06.720 --> 10:08.553
she may cut our tits off.

10:08.553 --> 10:09.679
How 'bout your kids?
They got any money

10:09.679 --> 10:11.470
- we could bum off 'em?
- Not a cent.

10:11.470 --> 10:13.261
I went through
their backpacks last night

10:13.261 --> 10:15.387
while they were sleeping.

10:15.387 --> 10:17.303
Me too.

10:17.303 --> 10:20.470
Mm, I'm afraid
it's an honest day's work

10:20.470 --> 10:22.303
for you and me, mi amigo.

10:22.303 --> 10:24.595
Any scams you wanna try?

10:24.595 --> 10:26.804
How 'bout
the Distract and Grab?

10:26.804 --> 10:27.970
Could do the Melon Drop.

10:27.970 --> 10:29.637
Old-fashioned
Pig in the Poke?

10:29.637 --> 10:33.470
I'm always down for a classic
Ukrainian Peekaboo.

10:33.470 --> 10:34.929
All good by me.

10:34.929 --> 10:36.136
All right.

10:38.303 --> 10:40.428
It's just a crime,
that's all,

10:40.428 --> 10:42.261
that-that Debbie
doesn't give you

10:42.261 --> 10:45.470
the respect you deserve.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.053
Tell me about it.

10:47.053 --> 10:50.679
You know, you sacrificed
so much for her.

10:50.679 --> 10:52.428
That, I did.

10:52.428 --> 10:54.261
You know,
she's ungrateful...

10:54.261 --> 10:55.679
- Yep.
- ...entitled...

10:55.679 --> 10:57.178
- Mm-hmm.
- ...spoiled.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.720
You know her well.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.011
Too bad there's not a way

11:00.011 --> 11:01.720
we could take control
away from her,

11:01.720 --> 11:03.970
you know, make you...
make you the king of the house,

11:03.970 --> 11:06.095
you know,
you set the rules here.

11:06.095 --> 11:09.178
Y-yeah, but how?

11:09.178 --> 11:12.553
I'm not sure. I mean,
wishful thinking, I guess.

11:12.553 --> 11:14.053
I gotta go get dressed.

11:14.053 --> 11:16.011
I don't wanna be late
for work.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.345
Check it out, Franny.

11:29.345 --> 11:31.720
I've worn these guys,
like, 15 times,

11:31.720 --> 11:33.929
and they're in perfect...
condition.

11:33.929 --> 11:35.303
Ha.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.637
Ready to be returned
to the store today.

11:37.637 --> 11:40.220
The key is plastic
sole protectors.

11:40.220 --> 11:42.428
Your mama's a genius.

11:42.428 --> 11:45.845
- Can I get 125 bucks?
- I'm sure you can,

11:45.845 --> 11:47.512
if you got a job
instead of lounging around

11:47.512 --> 11:49.220
watching YouTube videos
all summer.

11:49.220 --> 11:51.303
From my share
of the Fiona money.

11:51.303 --> 11:53.303
Mm...no.

11:53.303 --> 11:55.804
- Why not?
- It's in the bank...

11:55.804 --> 11:57.720
getting two point four percent
compound interest.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.053
Isn't it supposed to be
all of our money?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.804
What do you need it for
anyways?

12:01.804 --> 12:03.762
You get some girl
in trouble or something?

12:03.762 --> 12:06.053
No! I'm ten.

12:06.053 --> 12:08.387
Besides, abortions
are free anyway.

12:08.387 --> 12:09.929
They are?

12:11.220 --> 12:12.595
The state of Illinois

12:12.595 --> 12:15.595
supports women having control
of their bodies.

12:15.595 --> 12:16.970
What do you need it for,
then?

12:16.970 --> 12:18.804
A DNA test.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.553
Monica already
did one of those.

12:20.553 --> 12:21.929
Your hers...
and Frank's.

12:21.929 --> 12:23.679
Sorry to tell you.

12:23.679 --> 12:27.345
An africanancestry.com
DNA test.

12:27.345 --> 12:29.261
Wanna see where I come from.

12:29.261 --> 12:31.762
You come from Africa.
Happy?

12:31.762 --> 12:33.887
Are you ready to go?

12:34.553 --> 12:36.095
Let's go.

12:39.261 --> 12:41.845
-  Let go, baby.

12:48.470 --> 12:51.011
-  Hey, Debs.
- Hey.

12:51.011 --> 12:52.136
Here's the new daddy.

12:52.136 --> 12:54.011
Hey, Franny.

12:54.011 --> 12:55.637
What's up with that glove?

12:55.637 --> 12:57.303
Oh, I stole a few
from the hospital

12:57.303 --> 13:00.011
so I'm not touching him with
a smoky hand later, you know?

13:00.011 --> 13:02.303
Or you could just quit.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.679
Oh, hi!

13:04.679 --> 13:07.387
There's my sweet
little nephew.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.595
What'd you decide to name him?

13:08.595 --> 13:09.762
Freddie.

13:09.762 --> 13:11.970
Like Kruger?

13:11.970 --> 13:14.428
Uh...Fred, then.

13:14.428 --> 13:16.470
-  Fred Flintstone?
- I don't know.

13:16.470 --> 13:17.762
I was tired as shit
when I filled out the forms

13:17.762 --> 13:19.136
at the hospital.

13:19.136 --> 13:20.637
It was the first name
I thought of.

13:20.637 --> 13:23.303
It's my professor's name,
Clyde Fred Youens.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.845
Hopefully Tami likes it.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.303
We didn't really have
a chance to discuss it.

13:27.303 --> 13:29.762
- How's she doin'?
- She's got a bad infection.

13:29.762 --> 13:31.512
She's all jacked up
on drugs.

13:31.512 --> 13:33.095
It's a little touch-and-go.

13:35.220 --> 13:37.136
I think she'll be fine.

13:37.136 --> 13:39.637
You know,
hopefully she'll be fine.

13:39.637 --> 13:41.762
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

13:43.637 --> 13:46.136
All right, well...

13:46.136 --> 13:47.679
...see you later.

13:47.679 --> 13:49.679
- Come on, Franny.
- Bye. Wait, whoa.

13:49.679 --> 13:51.053
You're not gonna
help me out today?

13:51.053 --> 13:52.679
No can do.
I got shit to do.

13:52.679 --> 13:54.345
The new couch is getting
delivered today.

13:54.345 --> 13:56.178
Can you make sure
to let the delivery guy in?

13:56.178 --> 13:58.762
Come on, Debs, I-I need a nap.
I been up, like, 27 hours.

13:58.762 --> 14:01.011
Get used to it.
It's your new normal.

14:01.011 --> 14:03.553
Fine.
Yeah, no, we'll be...

14:03.553 --> 14:05.762
we'll be fine.

14:08.387 --> 14:10.428
Shit! Hey.

14:19.887 --> 14:21.887
Good-bye, LeBrons.

14:23.804 --> 14:26.720
Here you go.
Take 'em.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.303
Thought they were gonna
help me play b-ball better,

14:28.303 --> 14:30.053
but...

14:30.053 --> 14:32.845
I guess I'm, uh,

14:32.845 --> 14:33.887
past my prime.

14:35.053 --> 14:36.887
Just the middleman here,
amigo.

14:36.887 --> 14:39.387
- Got a can in this place?

14:39.387 --> 14:40.720
Yeah, right over there.

14:43.095 --> 14:45.220
I'll take a beer and a shot
of Jaeger when I'm out.

14:45.220 --> 14:46.428
Okay.

14:50.053 --> 14:51.970
He just leaves them here?

14:51.970 --> 14:54.553
Maybe he's telling you
it's okay to pull a Scamazon.

14:54.553 --> 14:56.261
- A what?
- Scamazon.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.345
I returned my microwave,

14:59.345 --> 15:03.345
except I put a brick in the box
instead of the microwave.

15:03.345 --> 15:05.804
Soon as On Board Shipping
scanned the return,

15:05.804 --> 15:08.845
my money was instantly
credited back to me.

15:08.845 --> 15:10.428
They never checked
inside the box.

15:10.428 --> 15:12.720
That's genius.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.136
...ly stupid
is what I was gonna say.

15:15.136 --> 15:17.470
- Why's that again?
- Because it's wrong.

15:17.470 --> 15:18.720
It's wrong.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.261
Not if it's a big
corporation.

15:20.261 --> 15:21.428
Yeah, he's right.

15:21.428 --> 15:22.929
I'd never do it
to a little guy, you know,

15:22.929 --> 15:25.011
like some mom-and-pop place.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.845
But a big company,
they factor that stuff in.

15:27.845 --> 15:30.220
It's stealing no matter
who you do it to.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.512
Then I guess
you don't wanna know

15:31.512 --> 15:33.136
about another way
to Scamazon.

15:33.136 --> 15:34.178
- No.
- Yes.

15:34.178 --> 15:35.470
I ordered shit,

15:35.470 --> 15:37.136
told them that I didn't
receive it,

15:37.136 --> 15:38.553
even though I did.

15:38.553 --> 15:40.261
So they sent me another.

15:40.261 --> 15:42.136
You mean I coulda got
two pairs of sneakers?

15:42.136 --> 15:43.970
That's why I have
two fleshlights.

15:43.970 --> 15:46.011
You saying flashlight
or fleshlight?

15:46.011 --> 15:48.220
I think you know
what I'm sayin'.

15:48.220 --> 15:49.845
That delivery guy's dead.

15:49.845 --> 15:51.804
Can I have another beer,
please?

15:53.762 --> 15:55.095
What?

15:55.095 --> 15:57.136
He said he wants
another beer.

15:58.929 --> 16:01.637
-  Aw, jeez.
-  Oh, jeez.

16:01.637 --> 16:03.261
What's he doing
with a belt around his neck

16:03.261 --> 16:05.303
- while he was taking a piss?
- He was jacking off, Kev.

16:05.303 --> 16:06.970
And strangling himself
at the same time.

16:06.970 --> 16:08.512
Why?

16:08.512 --> 16:10.637
- 'Cause it feels good.
- Mm.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.387
Is that that
autoerotic shit?

16:12.387 --> 16:13.178
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

16:13.178 --> 16:15.804
Aw, dude, come on!

16:15.804 --> 16:17.178
I never had
the courage.

16:17.178 --> 16:18.261
Why the fuck's he doing
it in our bathroom?

16:18.261 --> 16:19.845
Couldn't he wait
till he got home?

16:19.845 --> 16:22.345
- When the urge hits...
- You guys are idiots.

16:22.345 --> 16:24.011
He didn't use
a lemon.

16:24.011 --> 16:25.845
Even I don't know that one.

16:25.845 --> 16:27.929
Y-you keep a lemon
in your mouth.

16:27.929 --> 16:30.053
That way, when you pass out
and start to seize,

16:30.053 --> 16:32.720
you bite into the lemon,
wake yourself up.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.053
Maybe I should try that
sometime, then.

16:35.053 --> 16:37.178
- So what do we do now?
- Call the cops.

16:37.178 --> 16:38.970
Or we could
raid his truck first.

16:38.970 --> 16:40.261
- Yes.
- Yeah.

16:40.261 --> 16:42.011
- I mean, dead is dead.
- Yeah.

16:42.011 --> 16:43.345
What's a couple of hours?

16:43.345 --> 16:44.387
That's a good point.
Let's go.

16:44.387 --> 16:45.470
Yeah.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.387
Hold on!
Stop.

16:47.387 --> 16:49.178
V's right.
Stop.

16:49.178 --> 16:51.095
This joker comes
into my bathroom,

16:51.095 --> 16:53.053
jacks off, chokes himself,

16:53.053 --> 16:54.970
then was gonna have
a shot and a beer,

16:54.970 --> 16:57.220
go back on his big truck
to work

16:57.220 --> 16:59.970
all hammered and jizzed out
do I have this right?

16:59.970 --> 17:00.887
- Absolutely correct.
- Yeah.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.053
One hundred percent.

17:03.553 --> 17:05.095
Fuck him.
He coulda killed a kid.

17:05.095 --> 17:06.804
He deserves to have
his truck ransacked.

17:06.804 --> 17:09.053
Move. I got first dibs.

17:09.053 --> 17:11.387
- That's my girl.

17:15.011 --> 17:17.220
One-eighty over 120.

17:17.220 --> 17:20.387
That's high, Ernesto.
You gotta cut out the salt.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.261
Salt's the only edible thing
in this place.

17:22.261 --> 17:23.720
Yeah, well...

17:23.720 --> 17:25.804
About halfway finished
there, Chester.

17:25.804 --> 17:29.011
Put some Drano in the line,
take me outta my misery.

17:29.011 --> 17:30.428
Hey, come on, now.

17:30.428 --> 17:31.845
You're up for a compassionate
release, right?

17:31.845 --> 17:35.178
Compassionate release,
my ass.

17:35.178 --> 17:37.553
The only person my release
would be compassionate to

17:37.553 --> 17:40.804
is Mr. Johnny Dingleberry
taxpayer

17:40.804 --> 17:42.261
who doesn't wanna
foot the bill

17:42.261 --> 17:45.053
for my medical expenses
in here.

17:45.053 --> 17:47.053
You get to see your family,
your friends.

17:47.053 --> 17:48.595
They're all dead.

17:48.595 --> 17:51.553
Why do you think they put me
in here in the first place?

17:51.553 --> 17:52.929
Make new friends.

17:52.929 --> 17:55.762
I been in here
for 30 years.

17:55.762 --> 17:57.637
I wouldn't survive
two days out there.

17:57.637 --> 17:59.178
I'm pissin' blood.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.470
My shingles
are flarin' up.

18:01.470 --> 18:04.970
And I've got dementia...
I think.

18:04.970 --> 18:08.720
Hey, let me ask you
a question.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.261
How'd you and Marco survive
in that cell all those years

18:11.261 --> 18:13.220
- without killing each other?
- Oh, that's easy.

18:13.220 --> 18:14.595
You ju

18:14.595 --> 18:17.512
Oh, wait, now.

18:17.512 --> 18:18.762
Who's Marco?

18:18.762 --> 18:20.887
Your prison wife.

18:20.887 --> 18:23.178
You were together,
like, 12 years.

18:23.178 --> 18:26.679
He's six-foot-five,
Hispanic.

18:26.679 --> 18:28.553
He likes to eat
people's faces.

18:28.553 --> 18:30.929
Does sound like someone
I'd date.

18:30.929 --> 18:32.261
Okay, never mind.

18:32.261 --> 18:34.804
Are you talkin'
about you and Mickey?

18:34.804 --> 18:37.470
Okay, you remember Mickey
but not Marco?

18:37.470 --> 18:39.470
Who's Marco?

18:39.470 --> 18:41.470
- Forget about it.
- Uh, you and your fella

18:41.470 --> 18:43.553
just need
a little time apart,

18:43.553 --> 18:45.470
a temporary separation.

18:45.470 --> 18:47.637
A mini vacation.

18:47.637 --> 18:49.595
How am I supposed
to do that in prison?

18:49.595 --> 18:50.595
I'll tell ya how.

18:53.053 --> 18:55.178
But you need to stab me.

18:55.178 --> 18:57.804
Just deep enough
so they have to keep me here,

18:57.804 --> 19:01.970
and then you can go to solitary
for a couple of weeks.

19:04.804 --> 19:06.637
Let's go
while I'm middle-aged, huh?

19:06.637 --> 19:08.387
- Hurry up, Kev!
- I'm trying.

19:08.387 --> 19:10.220
He's got, like,
a million keys.

19:10.220 --> 19:11.679
Let's go.
I'm losin' my beer buzz.

19:11.679 --> 19:14.095
Okay, I hear all of you!

19:14.095 --> 19:15.929
Dude, let's go,
come on.

19:15.929 --> 19:17.512
Got it.
Jackpot!

19:17.512 --> 19:19.762
Stand back.

19:24.053 --> 19:26.845
- Oh, wow.
- Holy shit.

19:26.845 --> 19:27.845
Gimme some!

19:30.136 --> 19:31.720
This is like
rich people Christmas.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.345
God is great!

19:34.345 --> 19:36.178
I been praying for this moment
since I was six years old.

19:36.178 --> 19:37.970
My good karma
is finally paying off.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.136
Shut up, Kevin.
Hoist me up.

19:41.512 --> 19:43.095
Yeah,
that one right there.

19:43.095 --> 19:46.220
Lyft should be here
in a sec.

19:46.220 --> 19:48.637
Silver..."Ha-wan-day."
Is that how you say that?

19:48.637 --> 19:49.762
"Hundye."

19:49.762 --> 19:52.845
I think it's "Hunday."

19:52.845 --> 19:54.845
You wanna get hit
or cut?

19:54.845 --> 19:56.261
Let's flip a coin.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.929
If we had a coin,
we wouldn't be out here.

19:58.929 --> 20:00.804
- I'll get cut.
- Sounds good.

20:00.804 --> 20:02.053
I'll get hit.

20:02.053 --> 20:03.220
- Okay.

20:03.220 --> 20:04.929
See you around the corner.

20:08.470 --> 20:10.720
Mickey?

20:10.720 --> 20:12.970
It's Mikey.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.053
Who the fuck is Mickey?

20:25.011 --> 20:26.011
How's your day going
so far?

20:26.011 --> 20:28.136
Oh, uh, fine.

20:28.136 --> 20:30.929
Um, could you put on
a little classical music?

20:30.929 --> 20:32.679
Yeah, sure thing.

20:36.804 --> 20:38.470
- Oh, shit!

20:38.470 --> 20:40.762
Ahh! Ohh! Ahh!

20:40.762 --> 20:42.845
Watch what you're doing,
lady!

20:42.845 --> 20:44.929
You just hit that man!

20:44.929 --> 20:47.470
- Oh, God!
- Are you okay?

20:47.470 --> 20:49.303
I think you broke
my leg.

20:49.303 --> 20:51.720
- Oh, God!
- And my face, it's bleeding!

20:51.720 --> 20:54.428
Um, okay, stay right there.
I'll call the police

20:54.428 --> 20:55.804
- and an ambulance.
- Oh, oh, oh! Oh, no!

20:55.804 --> 20:57.845
I-I-I can go
to the ER myself.

20:57.845 --> 21:00.053
I'll probably hobble there
myself too.

21:00.053 --> 21:02.178
No, but your leg!
I'll drive you both.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.970
No disrespect, but...

21:03.970 --> 21:06.220
I'm too scared to get
in your death mobile again.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.679
Hey, what are they hitting
ya for at the ER these days?

21:08.679 --> 21:10.261
Couple hundy.

21:10.261 --> 21:12.136
Oy. I'm no Rockefeller.

21:12.136 --> 21:15.136
I-I'm just gonna wait
till my leg heals.

21:17.011 --> 21:20.637
Unless...you wanted
to make things right.

21:24.345 --> 21:26.804
You fools are a couple
of scam artists, aren't you?

21:26.804 --> 21:28.970
- What are you talking about?
- No!

21:28.970 --> 21:30.261
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

21:30.261 --> 21:33.136
You old farts
need to get fresh.

21:34.804 --> 21:36.428
Hey, wait.
You're leaving...

21:36.428 --> 21:38.387
you're leaving
a crime scene!

21:40.136 --> 21:41.804
Fresh?

21:43.929 --> 21:45.970
You wanna go again?

21:45.970 --> 21:48.011
I'll get cut this time.

21:48.011 --> 21:49.470
Fresh.

21:52.637 --> 21:54.553
Dude, your kid
is totally white.

21:54.553 --> 21:57.679
Doesn't even look like he has
one drop of black blood in him.

21:57.679 --> 22:00.220
Yeah, well,
have you seen his parents?

22:00.220 --> 22:01.345
You know, when we screwed,

22:01.345 --> 22:03.011
it was like two pieces
of chalk fucking.

22:03.011 --> 22:04.804
Isn't it easier
just to quit smoking?

22:04.804 --> 22:06.261
Plannin' on it, but...

22:06.261 --> 22:07.387
I thought I'd have
a lot more time

22:07.387 --> 22:09.804
before the baby came,
and, you know, besides,

22:09.804 --> 22:12.095
the nicotine's
keeping me awake and...

22:12.095 --> 22:13.553
calm my nerves.

22:13.553 --> 22:15.428
This dad shit's scary.

22:15.428 --> 22:16.845
- You raised us.
- Yeah, but I didn't care

22:16.845 --> 22:18.512
if I killed you guys.

22:18.512 --> 22:19.762
I wanna keep Freddie alive.

22:21.220 --> 22:23.136
Why am I the only one
in the family

22:23.136 --> 22:24.595
that has black skin?

22:24.595 --> 22:26.595
Think it has something to do
with Monica's granddad,

22:26.595 --> 22:29.845
although we never really
got a straight answer.

22:29.845 --> 22:31.970
Sucks not knowing
my family tree.

22:31.970 --> 22:33.595
Who cares?

22:33.595 --> 22:35.679
- You're a Gallagher.
- Yeah.

22:35.679 --> 22:37.512
In this house, I am,
but out there,

22:37.512 --> 22:40.011
I'm a black kid that lives
on the South Side of Chicago.

22:41.887 --> 22:43.720
I went to Urban Outfitters,

22:43.720 --> 22:46.387
and a security guard
followed me for 20 minutes.

22:46.387 --> 22:48.428
Says "urban" in their title.

22:48.428 --> 22:50.887
-  Okay, he's hungry.

22:50.887 --> 22:53.553
Uh, this is gonna be
his first feeding at home.

22:53.553 --> 22:55.387
You have a bottle or something
I can warm up?

22:55.387 --> 22:58.220
Nope. Tami wants me
to breastfeed him.

22:58.220 --> 22:59.970
How?

23:02.095 --> 23:03.679
Oh.

23:03.679 --> 23:06.595
I know it's ridiculous,
but...

23:06.595 --> 23:11.637
Tami says he needs to learn
how to latch onto the boob.

23:11.637 --> 23:14.887
Yeah, it's also good
for attachment and shit.

23:14.887 --> 23:17.470
Here we go. Let's show Liam
how we do it, huh?

23:17.470 --> 23:20.095
- You wanna show Uncle Liam?

23:20.095 --> 23:21.804
You wanna show Uncle Liam?
Here we go. Here we go.

23:21.804 --> 23:23.303
Here we go. Shh, shh, shh.

23:23.303 --> 23:25.679
A little suck.
A little suck.

23:25.679 --> 23:28.220
- Little suck, little suck.

23:28.220 --> 23:31.011
And shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

23:32.220 --> 23:33.428
He-e-ey!

23:33.428 --> 23:35.303
Hey, he did it!

23:35.303 --> 23:37.512
He did it.
He's sucking. He latched!

23:37.512 --> 23:40.220
You're like a walking PSA
to wear a condom.

23:54.637 --> 23:57.512
Okay, so that's three
Cap'n Bob's fish specials,

23:57.512 --> 24:00.470
one with tots, one with fries,
and one with slaw.

24:00.470 --> 24:01.804
Be ready in 15.

24:03.345 --> 24:04.637
Yo, where do you think
you're going?

24:04.637 --> 24:06.136
Are you deaf or something?

24:06.136 --> 24:08.637
I'm looking for Lori.
She, uh, doing a bank run?

24:08.637 --> 24:10.679
You want me to cap
your ass or what?

24:10.679 --> 24:13.053
- I'd like to see you try.
- Don't think I won't.

24:13.053 --> 24:13.970
Carl Gallagher.

24:13.970 --> 24:16.720
Hey.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.679
Mm. Smells as good
as the day I met ya.

24:19.679 --> 24:21.470
You're Carl.

24:21.470 --> 24:23.387
Yeah.
Heard of me?

24:23.387 --> 24:25.762
This is Anne Gonzalez,
assistant manager.

24:25.762 --> 24:28.679
Tough as nails.
She keeps everybody in line.

24:32.095 --> 24:33.553
So...

24:33.553 --> 24:35.095
you ready to get back
to work?

24:35.095 --> 24:37.345
- Yeah.
- Great.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.011
Hey, Dirk,

24:41.011 --> 24:43.136
Carl's back.

24:43.136 --> 24:45.011
Arrivederci,  buddy.

24:45.929 --> 24:47.553
Oh, shit.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.136
I'm sorry, Wheels.

24:49.136 --> 24:51.011
I told you this day
was gonna come.

24:51.011 --> 24:52.220
You firing me, Lori?

24:52.220 --> 24:53.387
You should be
collecting disability.

24:53.387 --> 24:55.261
What you wanna work for
anyway?

24:55.261 --> 24:57.595
- Have a purpose in life?
- Overrated.

24:59.095 --> 25:00.929
I'll go get your uniform.

25:00.929 --> 25:03.345
I been savin' it.

25:03.345 --> 25:04.637
-  Can I help you?
- Picking up an order

25:04.637 --> 25:06.095
for Pedro.

25:08.387 --> 25:11.720
Uh, two shrimp tacos.
That's $7.70.

25:11.720 --> 25:15.387
Friend said I should ask
for extra tartar sauce.

25:15.387 --> 25:17.303
It's 26 bucks
for the tartar sauce.

25:17.303 --> 25:18.845
And $7.70 for the tacos.

25:24.887 --> 25:26.136
Here you go.

25:26.136 --> 25:28.512
Did you get my letters?

25:28.512 --> 25:31.178
Yeah. Why'd you send me
dick pics?

25:31.178 --> 25:34.387
It wasn't my dick, silly.

25:34.387 --> 25:35.929
Now, get your cute keister
to work.

25:35.929 --> 25:37.387
Fryolator's calling your name.

25:59.512 --> 26:00.136
Okay, would you stop
doing that?

26:00.136 --> 26:01.595
Stop fucking doing that.

26:01.595 --> 26:03.762
For the love of Christ,
not again!

26:03.762 --> 26:06.220
Mind your business,
Enzo!

26:06.220 --> 26:07.762
We need to talk.

26:07.762 --> 26:09.428
- About what?
- About the fact

26:09.428 --> 26:11.220
that we wanna kill
each other.

26:11.220 --> 26:12.136
I don't know what you
want from me.

26:12.136 --> 26:13.512
Stop bein' so annoying!

26:15.345 --> 26:17.720
You remember
when we first got here?

26:17.720 --> 26:19.345
We had fun together.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.887
Yeah.
All we did was bang.

26:21.887 --> 26:24.011
We laughed too.

26:24.011 --> 26:26.428
What happened to us?

26:26.428 --> 26:28.303
This place happened.

26:29.345 --> 26:31.762
Gets to ya.

26:31.762 --> 26:33.512
I don't want it to.

26:33.512 --> 26:36.845
Well, don't really
have much of a choice.

26:39.261 --> 26:41.637
How 'bout, like, a...

26:41.637 --> 26:43.679
temporary separation?

26:43.679 --> 26:47.136
- How we supposed to do that?
- Well, I could stab Chester.

26:47.136 --> 26:48.679
What you wanna stab
Chester for?

26:48.679 --> 26:50.428
- He's gonna get released soon.
- Who gives a shit?

26:50.428 --> 26:52.011
So if I stab him,
he gets to stay and

26:52.011 --> 26:53.303
What are you
talking about right now?

26:53.303 --> 26:55.804
And I get sent
to solitary.

26:58.136 --> 27:00.762
Wait. A-are you dumpin' me?

27:02.261 --> 27:04.512
- We need a break.
- Fuck you.

27:04.512 --> 27:05.804
We can't keep goin' on
like this.

27:05.804 --> 27:08.136
Okay, you want a break?
I'll give you a break.

27:08.136 --> 27:10.220
I'm gonna stab Chester,
and I'm gonna go to solitary.

27:10.220 --> 27:11.637
- What are you talking about?
- You're not dumping me.

27:11.637 --> 27:13.804
I'm dumping you.
Where's the shiv?

27:13.804 --> 27:15.470
Where'd you put it?

27:15.470 --> 27:17.345
And no, you're not
stabbing him. I am.

27:17.345 --> 27:19.178
Free country.

27:19.178 --> 27:20.845
You're an asshole.

27:20.845 --> 27:22.303
Takes one to know one,
bitch.

27:28.387 --> 27:29.762
God.

27:30.887 --> 27:33.053
Ah!

27:33.053 --> 27:34.428
Found it, bitch.

27:34.428 --> 27:37.053
-  Lockdown.

27:37.053 --> 27:39.387
Oh, you're kidding me.

27:45.929 --> 27:47.637
Hey.

27:47.637 --> 27:49.762
I'm here
to return these shoes.

27:52.804 --> 27:54.804
- Anything wrong with them?
- No.

27:54.804 --> 27:57.345
I've just got so many
of them at home.

27:57.345 --> 28:00.303
- Do you have the receipt?
- Sure do.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.053
Here you go.

28:04.220 --> 28:06.428
Thirty days exactly.

28:06.428 --> 28:07.512
Mm.

28:07.512 --> 28:09.470
Why don't I just
process this return?

28:09.470 --> 28:11.053
Cool.

28:11.053 --> 28:13.845
But first...

28:13.845 --> 28:15.261
What's that?

28:15.261 --> 28:16.845
Black light.

28:16.845 --> 28:18.720
Need to check
if they've been worn.

28:18.720 --> 28:21.679
Oh, uh, well,
I mean, look at them.

28:21.679 --> 28:23.553
They've never
been worn before.

28:23.553 --> 28:25.720
- You see?
- Yes, to my naked eye.

28:25.720 --> 28:29.553
But my naked eye can't see
invisible bodily fluids.

28:29.553 --> 28:31.553
You wouldn't imagine
what lengths people go to

28:31.553 --> 28:32.762
trying to make it look like

28:32.762 --> 28:34.929
they've never worn
a pair of shoes.

28:34.929 --> 28:37.637
Everyone trying
to cheat the system.

28:39.553 --> 28:41.011
Including you.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.762
- Excuse me?
- Check it out.

28:44.762 --> 28:47.095
Toddler urine.
Blood.

28:47.095 --> 28:49.428
Surprise, surprise.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.470
- A little bit of vomit.
- You can tell all that?

28:52.470 --> 28:54.428
Sorry, I can't accept
these returns.

28:55.220 --> 28:58.261
No, but, sir,
your thingy's wrong.

28:58.261 --> 28:59.929
I've never worn
those shoes before.

28:59.929 --> 29:02.929
Don't make me look you up
on Instagram.

29:02.929 --> 29:05.011
I'm sure you posted plenty
of selfies in these shoes.

29:07.261 --> 29:09.387
Please, sir,

29:09.387 --> 29:12.845
I'm a single mother
struggling to make ends meet.

29:12.845 --> 29:16.387
I just wanted something nice
for once in my life.

29:16.387 --> 29:18.637
I promise you, I will
never do this again,

29:18.637 --> 29:20.929
but these shoes are 800 bucks.

29:20.929 --> 29:22.595
I can't afford that.

29:23.804 --> 29:26.553
Suppose I could
make an exception.

29:26.553 --> 29:28.845
- Thank you.
- Under one condition.

29:28.845 --> 29:31.637
- Anything.
- You blow me after my shift.

29:31.637 --> 29:34.595
Why does everything
have to come down to sex?

29:34.595 --> 29:36.679
'Cause sex is awesome.

29:36.679 --> 29:39.220
No. You just wanna feel
like you have power over me.

29:39.220 --> 29:41.303
That's awesome too.

29:41.303 --> 29:44.720
Can't I just, like,
wash your car

29:44.720 --> 29:47.178
or something?

29:47.178 --> 29:48.804
Mm...

29:48.804 --> 29:51.887
not as satisfying.

29:51.887 --> 29:53.929
So it's all about
degrading me, then.

29:55.261 --> 29:58.178
I...guess.

29:58.178 --> 30:01.428
Yes, it-it probably is.

30:06.428 --> 30:08.345
Okay.

30:08.345 --> 30:10.970
How 'bout...

30:10.970 --> 30:13.553
how 'bout I  give  you
a blow job?

30:13.553 --> 30:14.845
You just said
it was degrading.

30:14.845 --> 30:17.470
It is, when you ask for it.

30:17.470 --> 30:19.345
It's different
if you do?

30:19.345 --> 30:22.136
Yeah.
'Cause then it's my choice.

30:22.136 --> 30:24.887
It's my decision.
And I have the power.

30:24.887 --> 30:27.470
Okay.

30:27.470 --> 30:29.095
Then sure.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.637
I'd love a blow job.

30:30.637 --> 30:33.011
- Deal.
- I get off in two hours.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.929
See you in two hours.

30:37.929 --> 30:39.679
Have a good day!

30:39.679 --> 30:41.762
- Shh.

30:41.762 --> 30:45.929
Whoa! Oh, you sound like
your Grandpa Frank.

30:45.929 --> 30:48.595
Yes, you do.

30:48.595 --> 30:50.720
Let's see what's going on
in that diaper, huh?

30:50.720 --> 30:53.720
'Cause that's...
a little smelly.

30:53.720 --> 30:56.804
Pee-yew!

30:56.804 --> 30:58.053
- I got you. I got you.

30:58.053 --> 30:59.720
I got you.

31:02.303 --> 31:03.970
Whoa!

31:03.970 --> 31:06.970
How'd that much poop
come outta you, huh?

31:06.970 --> 31:10.136
One sec, all right?
One sec.

31:10.136 --> 31:12.637
Okay, here we go.

31:12.637 --> 31:14.845
Here we go.

31:14.845 --> 31:16.762
Ooh, that's black.

31:16.762 --> 31:18.345
Yeah, they said
that'd be black.

31:18.345 --> 31:20.512
I'm really just
smushing it around, aren't I?

31:20.512 --> 31:22.428
Uh...

31:22.428 --> 31:25.178
hey, I got an idea, all right?

31:32.804 --> 31:34.595
- I got you.

31:34.595 --> 31:36.762
Ready?

31:36.762 --> 31:38.387
Here we go.

31:40.345 --> 31:43.220
That's good.
Okay.

31:44.178 --> 31:45.261
Okay.

31:46.595 --> 31:47.929
Yeah?

31:47.929 --> 31:49.428
Hey.

31:49.428 --> 31:51.470
Good as new.

31:51.470 --> 31:53.887
All right?

31:53.887 --> 31:55.762
Let's get a new diaper on you

31:55.762 --> 31:57.762
and then we can have our nap,
okay?

31:57.762 --> 32:00.762
I'm just gonna find
a new diaper.

32:04.387 --> 32:06.637
Hospital only gave us
one diaper.

32:06.637 --> 32:11.136
Buddy,
what are we gonna do?

32:12.804 --> 32:15.553
I know.

32:17.887 --> 32:19.845
Here goes another one!

32:19.845 --> 32:22.637
Open it! Open it!

32:22.637 --> 32:24.679
Open it! Open it!

32:24.679 --> 32:26.970
I bet it's another one of those
essential oil diffusers.

32:26.970 --> 32:30.261
It's crazy how many people
ordered that piece of crap.

32:30.261 --> 32:33.428
Hey, I'm excited to use my
piece of crap when I get home.

32:33.428 --> 32:35.762
Another Vitamix!

32:35.762 --> 32:37.136
- Yes!

32:37.136 --> 32:39.095
- Let's take it, V.
- We already have one, Kev.

32:39.095 --> 32:41.095
Oh, right.
All right, who wants it?

32:41.095 --> 32:43.428
- Oh, me!
- Me, me, me, me!

32:43.428 --> 32:44.804
Here you go, Kermit.

32:44.804 --> 32:45.970
You haven't had anything
in a while.

32:45.970 --> 32:48.053
- Thank you, Kev.
- You're welcome, buddy.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.303
All right, V.

32:49.303 --> 32:51.053
- Bring the next box out.
-  Yeah!

32:51.053 --> 32:54.804
-  Come on, now!
-  Come on.

32:54.804 --> 32:56.970
- There's nothin' left.
- What?

32:56.970 --> 32:59.220
- Don't be greedy.

32:59.220 --> 33:01.095
You just got a bunch
of free stuff.

33:02.053 --> 33:03.512
What about the returns?

33:04.720 --> 33:06.470
- The what?
- Yeah.

33:06.470 --> 33:08.970
OBS guys have to drive
around picking up packages.

33:10.261 --> 33:11.845
That's right.

33:11.845 --> 33:14.095
There must be tons
of stuff out there!

33:14.095 --> 33:16.345
Yeah, well, we're not giving
it away for free this time.

33:16.345 --> 33:17.845
- We're not?
- No! We're gonna

33:17.845 --> 33:19.637
auction that off, make some
money off these ingrates.

33:19.637 --> 33:21.303
Go get that scanner thing
from the dead guy, Kev,

33:21.303 --> 33:23.345
- and pick up the packages.
- Can I drive the van?

33:23.345 --> 33:24.679
Knock yourself out.

33:24.679 --> 33:26.679
I'm gonna take this bassinet
over to Lip.

33:26.679 --> 33:28.929
How attached are you
to that pool?

33:34.679 --> 33:36.220
How's it going?

33:36.220 --> 33:38.011
Good. Good.

33:39.512 --> 33:41.011
Well, shit.

33:41.011 --> 33:43.220
Ah, don't let the collar
scare you.

33:43.220 --> 33:45.845
Just trying to make extra money
for the CYO basketball team.

33:45.845 --> 33:48.011
Not here to take you
to heaven...yet.

33:48.011 --> 33:50.470
Or worse,
the downstairs place.

33:52.095 --> 33:54.053
- Abort mission!
- What?

33:54.053 --> 33:55.261
It's a priest!

33:57.804 --> 33:59.679
Ooh!

33:59.679 --> 34:00.387
Heavens to Betsy.

34:03.762 --> 34:04.845
Are you okay?

34:04.845 --> 34:07.804
My leg.
My leg is broken.

34:07.804 --> 34:09.387
Oh, my Go
Oh, uh, uh...

34:09.387 --> 34:10.887
a priest,
a priest.

34:10.887 --> 34:12.929
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

34:12.929 --> 34:14.719
Oh.

34:16.136 --> 34:17.969
Wait.
What's going on here?

34:17.969 --> 34:19.428
Uh...we're good, Padre.

34:19.428 --> 34:21.094
Praise Jesus.

34:21.094 --> 34:22.969
I've been healed!

34:22.969 --> 34:24.594
Were you two
trying to scam me?

34:24.594 --> 34:26.053
Nah, it's just
a misunderstanding.

34:26.053 --> 34:27.094
We'll be on our way.

34:28.929 --> 34:31.344
If you're in need of money
for a meal, I can help.

34:32.094 --> 34:33.929
- Come again?
- The Lord, of course,

34:33.929 --> 34:36.512
wants you to promise
you won't use it on drugs.

34:38.261 --> 34:41.011
That would be a sin.

34:41.011 --> 34:42.594
- Thank you, Padre.
- Let's get outta here

34:42.594 --> 34:44.929
- before he changes his mind.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

34:44.929 --> 34:46.469
Okay, okay.

34:46.469 --> 34:48.512
Booze or coke
or a little of both, Frank?

34:48.512 --> 34:50.344
What do you say?
What do you say?

34:52.594 --> 34:54.553
What happened?

34:54.553 --> 34:56.762
Why ain't you happy?

34:56.762 --> 34:58.053
We got ten dollars.

34:58.053 --> 35:01.303
Ten dollars is not
gonna solve our problem.

35:01.303 --> 35:02.804
She's gonna kick us out.

35:02.804 --> 35:04.720
We gotta find a place
to sleep.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.470
It pisses me off.

35:06.470 --> 35:08.345
I got an inheritance
waiting for me,

35:08.345 --> 35:10.804
and Debbie's
holding it hostage.

35:11.970 --> 35:13.970
You know what
your problem is?

35:13.970 --> 35:16.220
You let women
run your life

35:16.220 --> 35:18.303
your daughters,
your dead wife,

35:18.303 --> 35:19.929
your mother too, I bet.

35:19.929 --> 35:21.970
It's true.

35:21.970 --> 35:23.303
She made me pee sitting down.

35:23.303 --> 35:26.136
Said I splashed
on her magazines.

35:26.136 --> 35:28.887
Those female types
have pussy-whipped

35:28.887 --> 35:32.637
the masculinity from your soul.

35:32.637 --> 35:34.720
They have.

35:34.720 --> 35:37.136
You know,
because of men like you,

35:37.136 --> 35:40.970
women like Debbie
feel entitled and empowered.

35:40.970 --> 35:42.303
They do.

35:42.303 --> 35:44.762
You need to break
the cycle, Frank!

35:44.762 --> 35:47.011
Press the reset button.

35:47.011 --> 35:49.428
You need to reclaim
your patriarchy.

35:51.512 --> 35:53.345
Let's go back
to the house,

35:53.345 --> 35:56.804
storm that castle,
and take back what's yours.

35:56.804 --> 35:59.011
- Yes!
-  Yes!

36:02.220 --> 36:03.470
You're hurting me.

36:03.470 --> 36:05.428
- Whoa, whoa.
- Come on!

36:24.720 --> 36:27.762
- All right.

36:27.762 --> 36:29.845
- All right.

36:29.845 --> 36:31.720
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.887
It's all right, buddy, okay?

36:33.887 --> 36:36.136
It's all right.

36:36.136 --> 36:38.553
It's all right.
You can stop crying, all right?

36:38.553 --> 36:40.845
Here we go.

36:40.845 --> 36:43.762
Here we go. Here we go.

36:43.762 --> 36:46.053
Hey, there you go, okay?

36:46.053 --> 36:48.887
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
real quick, okay, okay?

36:48.887 --> 36:50.679
Then I'm gonna come
right back.

36:50.679 --> 36:52.136
We'll take a nap together,
all right?

36:52.136 --> 36:54.387
- All right, shh, shh.

36:54.387 --> 36:55.804
Stay right there, okay?

36:55.804 --> 36:57.303
Stay right there.
Stay right there.

36:57.303 --> 36:58.804
- Okay.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.428
All right, I'm going
to the bathroom now, okay?

37:11.720 --> 37:14.428
I don't know how people go
to the bathroom with babies.

37:17.303 --> 37:20.595
I don't know how people do much
of anything with babies.

37:24.136 --> 37:26.470
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to...

37:28.428 --> 37:30.970
...take a shower till your mom
gets outta the hospital,

37:30.970 --> 37:33.595
- you know?

37:39.595 --> 37:40.887
Shit.

37:45.970 --> 37:48.679
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:48.679 --> 37:50.720
Where'd you go?

37:50.720 --> 37:51.970
Where'd you...go?

37:51.970 --> 37:53.970
How...does this even happen?

37:53.970 --> 37:55.637
You were right...here.

37:55.637 --> 37:58.011
You were right here.

37:58.011 --> 37:59.553
Are you serious?
I lost my baby?

37:59.553 --> 38:01.303
Fuck.
Freddie?

38:01.303 --> 38:04.845
Maybe he ran away
because you named him Freddie.

38:04.845 --> 38:06.220
Hey.

38:06.220 --> 38:08.136
Hey.

38:08.136 --> 38:11.136
And he has on
a sanitary pad with wings?

38:11.136 --> 38:13.136
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I ran outta diapers.

38:13.136 --> 38:15.136
You can't leave a baby
alone like that.

38:15.136 --> 38:17.470
- I fell asleep.
- You can't fall asleep.

38:17.470 --> 38:18.804
Hey, it was two seconds.

38:18.804 --> 38:20.553
Something could have
fell on him.

38:20.553 --> 38:21.970
Someone could have
stepped on him.

38:21.970 --> 38:23.387
Yeah, well, there's
no one else here, so...

38:26.095 --> 38:29.345
When's Tami gettin' out?

38:29.345 --> 38:32.679
She's still in ICU.
I-I don't know.

38:36.136 --> 38:38.470
I brought you
a baby gift.

38:38.470 --> 38:41.929
It's a bassinet,
but you need to assemble it.

38:45.679 --> 38:48.887
V...I'm tired, you know?

38:48.887 --> 38:51.428
Welcome to parenthood.

38:51.428 --> 38:52.679
You're only supposed to wear

38:52.679 --> 38:55.178
one of those nicotine patches
at a time.

39:00.804 --> 39:02.679
So...here we are.

39:02.679 --> 39:04.887
Yup.

39:04.887 --> 39:07.011
Do you do this with a lot
of women at the store?

39:07.011 --> 39:09.303
I get a fair amount
of play.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.387
Really?

39:11.387 --> 39:13.929
Why do you say it
like that?

39:13.929 --> 39:15.512
Shoe salesman?

39:15.512 --> 39:17.178
I'm actually a violinist.

39:17.178 --> 39:19.804
Oh! Yeah?

39:19.804 --> 39:21.220
Classically trained.

39:21.220 --> 39:22.720
Studied at Berkeley
School of Music.

39:22.720 --> 39:25.053
Oh...that's cool.

39:25.053 --> 39:26.887
I bet you're pretty good.

39:26.887 --> 39:29.011
Bring my violin to work
with me every day,

39:29.011 --> 39:32.220
thinking I'll...
play it at lunch.

39:32.220 --> 39:34.136
Instead I go
to Wetzel's Pretzel.

39:34.136 --> 39:36.220
I'm sure lots
of famous musicians

39:36.220 --> 39:37.387
hang out at the food court.

39:38.929 --> 39:40.428
- You ready?

39:40.428 --> 39:42.011
Wait.

39:42.011 --> 39:44.553
You think I like
looking at feet all day?

39:44.553 --> 39:47.136
Isn't that your job?

39:47.136 --> 39:50.387
I hate it.
I hate myself.

39:50.387 --> 39:53.303
That's why I try
to get women to blow me.

39:53.303 --> 39:55.178
Does it make you feel
any better about yourself?

39:55.178 --> 39:56.428
For a few minutes.

39:58.345 --> 40:00.595
Until
the self-loathing comes back.

40:00.595 --> 40:02.595
- Shall we do this?
- No, don't.

40:05.011 --> 40:06.679
I don't want...

40:06.679 --> 40:09.178
blow jobs from
random women anymore.

40:09.178 --> 40:10.428
No?

40:13.178 --> 40:15.387
I'm gonna give my notice.

40:15.387 --> 40:16.762
- What about my shoes?
- Keep 'em.

40:16.762 --> 40:18.011
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

40:19.553 --> 40:21.553
I'm going back
to the violin.

40:26.011 --> 40:28.970
Hey. What's goin' on?

40:28.970 --> 40:32.387
Why am I different
from everyone in my family?

40:32.387 --> 40:35.720
It's like, if I was adopted,
I would understand.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.178
but it's like I spun
the roulette wheel

40:37.178 --> 40:38.553
and landed on black.

40:38.553 --> 40:42.428
Because once upon a time,
a slave owner raped a slave.

40:42.428 --> 40:44.512
But now I'm being raised
by a bunch of crackers,

40:44.512 --> 40:46.637
and they won't even
give me the talk.

40:46.637 --> 40:48.345
You don't know about
the birds and the bees yet?

40:48.345 --> 40:50.804
Yeah. I've known
since I was six.

40:50.804 --> 40:53.720
The talk of how to survive
as a black man in America.

40:56.845 --> 40:58.470
Yo, yo, yo.

40:58.470 --> 41:00.428
That's a lotta returns.

41:00.428 --> 41:01.929
Yeah, this scanner machine
thingy

41:01.929 --> 41:03.679
is fun as shit.

41:11.470 --> 41:13.553
-  Can I help you?

41:26.637 --> 41:29.011
- Bye, Lori.
- See ya tomorrow.

41:29.011 --> 41:32.261
Unless I see you tonight when
you sneak into my apartment,

41:32.261 --> 41:34.345
'cause you know I leave
my key under my mat.

41:34.345 --> 41:35.804
Isn't that sexual harassment?

41:35.804 --> 41:37.553
It doesn't count
when you're a dude.

41:37.553 --> 41:38.512
Oh.

41:43.136 --> 41:44.178
So what's your deal?

41:45.762 --> 41:47.178
Meaning?

41:47.178 --> 41:49.512
- Well, you look like a chola.
- Excuse me?

41:49.512 --> 41:51.387
And there's been a whole lot
of little Mexican kids

41:51.387 --> 41:52.887
coming in here
to get takeout food today.

41:52.887 --> 41:54.595
You're making this
a race thing.

41:54.595 --> 41:55.762
No. I'm just wondering
if you're running

41:55.762 --> 41:58.303
some type of game up in here.

41:58.303 --> 42:00.053
The only game I'm running

42:00.053 --> 42:02.053
is expanding the Captain Bob
shrimp business

42:02.053 --> 42:04.053
to the Hispanic community.

42:12.929 --> 42:14.553
Tartar sauce.

42:18.303 --> 42:20.929
Vape?
Damn, girl.

42:22.887 --> 42:24.553
I am man!

42:24.553 --> 42:26.929
- Hear me roar!

42:26.929 --> 42:27.970
Rahh!

42:29.136 --> 42:31.053
Oh, shit.

42:32.261 --> 42:34.220
They're takin' my couch!

42:34.220 --> 42:36.804
Hey, leave that right there!

42:36.804 --> 42:38.762
That's my couch!

42:38.762 --> 42:40.762
Perfect.
Couch is perfect right there.

42:40.762 --> 42:43.095
We do not need this couch.

42:43.095 --> 42:45.553
Now, take it back right now.

42:45.553 --> 42:47.428
Sorry, man.
We just deliver shit.

42:47.428 --> 42:49.512
Ah, so comfy.

42:49.512 --> 42:51.553
And look, no fecal stains.

42:51.553 --> 42:53.303
That's my money
you're sittin' on.

42:53.303 --> 42:55.929
We needed a new couch, Frank.
So I took care of it.

42:55.929 --> 42:58.053
How 'bout you thank me
instead of bitching at me?

42:59.345 --> 43:01.136
- $600?
-  Wait, what?

43:01.136 --> 43:02.595
-  What?
-  Nice things cost.

43:02.595 --> 43:03.929
Yeah, but it's
our money too.

43:03.929 --> 43:06.178
Yeah, we should have a say
in what we buy.

43:06.178 --> 43:07.303
Yeah, I mean, it'd be nice

43:07.303 --> 43:08.428
to have some cash
to buy diapers

43:08.428 --> 43:10.387
instead of using
your sanitary pads.

43:10.387 --> 43:14.095
I, for one, am tired of being
repressed and controlled

43:14.095 --> 43:16.220
by the women in this family.

43:16.220 --> 43:17.679
Are you with me, gentlemen?

43:17.679 --> 43:19.220
It might just be
the sleep deprivation,

43:19.220 --> 43:21.303
but I kind of agree
with Frank.

43:21.303 --> 43:22.929
You know, me too.
Debbie and Fiona

43:22.929 --> 43:24.345
have been bitching at us
our whole lives.

43:24.345 --> 43:26.136
Look what you've done.

43:26.136 --> 43:27.512
Are you proud of yourself?

43:27.512 --> 43:29.428
No one wants you
to be in charge.

43:29.428 --> 43:31.512
We didn't elect you.

43:31.512 --> 43:34.470
We're on best behavior
for this little infant boy

43:34.470 --> 43:37.637
who still stands a chance
of feeling like a man someday.

43:37.637 --> 43:39.762
Oh, fuck you guys.
I don't need this shit.

43:39.762 --> 43:42.887
Fiona left me the money.
You don't like it, leave.

43:42.887 --> 43:45.970
Just like a bully
to say something like that.

43:48.970 --> 43:51.261
Who wants a beer and chicken?

43:52.637 --> 43:54.303
Ah, dude, your kid
smells like an ashtray.

44:24.595 --> 44:27.679
- Dude, I'm stabbing him.
- Not if I get there first.

44:27.679 --> 44:29.303
I have the shiv.

44:29.303 --> 44:31.512
Enzo slipped me his
through the vent, bitch.

44:36.470 --> 44:38.136
Oh!
Shit!

44:38.136 --> 44:40.011
Christ on a cross!

44:40.011 --> 44:41.512
Ohh!

44:41.512 --> 44:44.011
The arm?
Weak.

44:44.011 --> 44:45.428
-  Oh!
- Chester, it's Ian.

44:45.428 --> 44:47.136
You get to stay.
I stabbed you.

44:47.136 --> 44:48.345
No, no, no.

44:48.345 --> 44:49.804
Jesus Christ!

44:49.804 --> 44:51.512
Mick, you're gonna
fucking kill him!

44:51.512 --> 44:53.261
What are you two morons
doing?

44:53.261 --> 44:55.720
Hey, I stabbed Chester.
Send me to solitary, okay?

44:55.720 --> 44:57.220
No, no, no.
He's taking the fall for me.

44:57.220 --> 44:58.845
Thank you.
I-I stabbed this piece of shit.

44:58.845 --> 45:00.595
- No, I fuckin' stabbed in.
-  Jesus, Chester.

45:00.595 --> 45:02.512
You got two of them
to do it this time?

45:02.512 --> 45:03.762
This time?

45:03.762 --> 45:05.720
He does this
every couple months.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.470
Makes a deal with an inmate
to stab him

45:07.470 --> 45:09.387
so he can postpone his release.

45:11.762 --> 45:13.720
You two idiots
are comin' with me. Go.

45:13.720 --> 45:15.720
- Y
- Hey, I'm bleedin' out

45:15.720 --> 45:17.387
- over here.
- Calm down, Chester.

45:17.387 --> 45:19.303
I'll call the medic.

45:45.637 --> 45:49.011
What are you up to...
Deb-or-ah?

45:57.428 --> 46:00.929
Your mommy's gonna love you
so much, you know?

46:00.929 --> 46:03.762
She is.
Maybe not as much as me, but...

46:03.762 --> 46:06.178
it's gonna be pretty close.

46:06.178 --> 46:09.970
She's gonna gobble up
those teeny-tiny hands.

46:09.970 --> 46:11.845
Yeah.

46:11.845 --> 46:15.637
And those teeny-tiny ears too.
Huh? I'm sorry.

46:15.637 --> 46:18.387
And then you know
what she's gonna do?

46:20.303 --> 46:23.053
One, two, three,

46:23.053 --> 46:24.887
four, five.

46:24.887 --> 46:27.637
- Oh, shit, dude.

46:31.845 --> 46:33.637
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

46:33.637 --> 46:35.553
I got you, bud. I got you.

46:35.553 --> 46:37.720
I got you. I got you.

46:42.595 --> 46:43.929
Everything okay in there?

46:45.011 --> 46:47.220
I almost dropped him.

46:47.220 --> 46:49.011
Ah.

46:49.011 --> 46:50.470
Don't worry if you do.

46:50.470 --> 46:52.679
They're made of Jell-O
the first few months.

46:55.679 --> 46:58.845
He'll be fine.
You won't hurt him.

47:02.136 --> 47:03.762
Get some sleep, son.

47:06.053 --> 47:07.845
You look tired.

47:30.595 --> 47:33.512
Well, well.

47:33.512 --> 47:35.261
What do we have here?

47:35.261 --> 47:36.929
Mikey?

47:36.929 --> 47:39.178
I'm not Mikey.

47:39.178 --> 47:41.345
Jesus,
did you follow me here?

47:41.345 --> 47:43.345
I'm a dangerous man

47:43.345 --> 47:46.345
with a scary knife.

47:46.345 --> 47:48.512
And...and...

47:48.512 --> 47:50.970
I can't breathe
in this thing.

47:50.970 --> 47:52.970
A little help here,
please.

47:52.970 --> 47:55.970
- Ooh!
- What the hell do you want?

47:58.553 --> 47:59.804
Huh.

48:11.303 --> 48:13.345
You steal all this stuff?

48:14.470 --> 48:16.178
None of your business.

48:17.261 --> 48:18.720
"Purchase date."

48:21.261 --> 48:22.929
"Return by date."

48:24.178 --> 48:26.387
So you're buying this shit,

48:26.387 --> 48:28.053
using it,

48:28.053 --> 48:30.053
and returning it, aren't you?

48:31.595 --> 48:33.303
Get out of my she-shed.

48:33.303 --> 48:35.261
Oh, I will.

48:35.261 --> 48:39.011
I will, as soon as you answer
this one question for me.

48:41.095 --> 48:43.553
Who's your daddy?

48:43.553 --> 48:45.595
Why are men so pervy?

48:45.595 --> 48:47.095
I am not blowing you!

48:48.762 --> 48:50.970
Who said anything
about blowing me?

48:50.970 --> 48:52.970
You just asked,
"Who's your daddy?"

48:52.970 --> 48:55.845
I meant that in a real way,
not a sexual way.

48:55.845 --> 48:59.178
Frank is my best friend!
You're practically my daughter.

48:59.178 --> 49:02.637
Uh, yeah, no, I'm not.

49:02.637 --> 49:04.887
Who's your daddy?

49:04.887 --> 49:09.095
As in, you need
to respect him.

49:09.095 --> 49:11.095
Hell no.

49:12.595 --> 49:14.720
Well, then...

49:14.720 --> 49:16.512
you leave me no choice.

49:16.512 --> 49:17.970
No!

49:17.970 --> 49:20.261
Don't.

49:20.261 --> 49:24.011
You get these back when Frank
is head of the household

49:24.011 --> 49:26.053
and in charge
of the family money.

49:26.053 --> 49:28.303
You don't think I can
deck you right now?

49:28.303 --> 49:30.637
You don't think I could eat
these receipts right now?

49:30.637 --> 49:32.220
Don't eat that!

49:32.220 --> 49:34.345
You know what you
have to do.

49:37.345 --> 49:39.512
You got 24 hours.

49:39.512 --> 49:41.595
Make things right.

49:48.053 --> 49:49.679
Fuck!

50:18.679 --> 50:20.553
Quit tomorrow, okay?

50:58.095 --> 51:00.595
Sleep well, my prince,

51:00.595 --> 51:02.387
for tomorrow...

51:02.387 --> 51:04.053
you shall be king.

51:05.428 --> 51:07.470
Yeah.

51:16.512 --> 51:18.095
Wake up!

51:18.095 --> 51:20.512
Get up, Gallaghers.

51:20.512 --> 51:21.929
I just got Freddie
back down.

51:21.929 --> 51:23.387
You wake him,
so help me, God.

51:23.387 --> 51:25.053
Yeah, I know you're gonna
throw out my breakfast

51:25.053 --> 51:27.428
- if I'm not down in time.
- What is it this time, Debs?

51:27.428 --> 51:28.845
Cover your tits,
everyone.

51:28.845 --> 51:30.512
- She may have a knife.
- Shh!

51:30.512 --> 51:33.011
No knives.
What I do have, however,

51:33.011 --> 51:35.512
are ATM cards,
one for the each of you.

51:35.512 --> 51:37.220
What?

51:37.220 --> 51:39.512
Hundred bucks on each,
to be replaced weekly.

51:39.512 --> 51:40.804
- Sweet.
- 'Bout time.

51:40.804 --> 51:42.470
Well, I really should get
more on mine.

51:42.470 --> 51:43.970
I realized that I've been
holding power over all of you

51:43.970 --> 51:46.428
because I feel shitty
about myself.

51:46.428 --> 51:48.136
Uh, you only pull wings
off a fly

51:48.136 --> 51:50.178
because you're dead inside,
right?

51:53.303 --> 51:55.762
So...one for you...

51:55.762 --> 51:57.470
and you...

51:57.470 --> 51:58.845
you.

51:58.845 --> 52:00.470
Frank,

52:00.470 --> 52:02.637
if you wanna take over
as head of the household,

52:02.637 --> 52:03.720
please do.

52:03.720 --> 52:05.512
It's a shit job.

52:10.470 --> 52:12.970
My receipts.

52:27.178 --> 52:29.387
I can't believe that's
what you wanted to buy

52:29.387 --> 52:30.512
with your money.

52:30.512 --> 52:32.011
Gotta start a business, son.

52:32.011 --> 52:33.887
Can't get ahead
on a fry cook's salary.

52:33.887 --> 52:35.679
Plus, it's better than
that shitty ancestry kit

52:35.679 --> 52:37.261
you wanted to buy.

52:37.261 --> 52:39.011
- Just wanna know who I am.
- You're a Gallagher.

52:39.011 --> 52:41.428
- Same as me.
- I'm black.

52:41.428 --> 52:42.720
Yeah, and you get
to check the black card

52:42.720 --> 52:43.929
for the rest of your life.

52:43.929 --> 52:45.470
Move to the front of the line.
You got it made.

52:45.470 --> 52:47.512
Except I can't walk down
the street wearing a hoodie

52:47.512 --> 52:50.679
without worrying that a cop's
gonna put me in a chokehold.

52:50.679 --> 52:52.512
You can just pick up
your order over there.

52:54.512 --> 52:56.887
Hey, Anne,
I got a proposition for you.

52:56.887 --> 52:58.345
I know you're selling
vape pens

52:58.345 --> 53:00.303
to little Mexican kids.

53:00.303 --> 53:02.387
- That is not what I'm d
- Don't argue.

53:02.387 --> 53:03.970
I already looked
in your tartar sauce box.

53:03.970 --> 53:05.512
- Is than a euphemism?
- No.

53:05.512 --> 53:07.637
And I wanna go
into business with you.

53:07.637 --> 53:10.303
Why would I do that?

53:10.303 --> 53:12.220
Well, because you only have
the Hispanic market,

53:12.220 --> 53:13.845
and if you wanna expand
your business,

53:13.845 --> 53:15.720
you gotta tap into the underage
white kids that I know

53:15.720 --> 53:18.053
- and black kids...
- That I know.

53:18.053 --> 53:21.261
So you and I are partners now.
We'll split profits 50-50.

53:21.261 --> 53:22.387
Liam and I will go
to the playground,

53:22.387 --> 53:23.845
round up new buyers.

53:23.845 --> 53:25.887
And here's your supplies.

53:31.970 --> 53:33.679
Menthol?

53:33.679 --> 53:35.387
Trust me, my customers
will love it.

53:47.011 --> 53:48.136
- I stabbed him first.
- No, you did not.

53:48.136 --> 53:49.553
- Oh, shut up.
- You shut up.

53:49.553 --> 53:50.679
Don't fuckin' tell me
what to do.

53:50.679 --> 53:51.970
If you shut
your fuckin' pie hole,

53:51.970 --> 53:53.095
I wouldn't have
to tell you what to do.

53:53.095 --> 53:54.428
Yeah, please,
that'll be the day,

53:54.428 --> 53:56.011
when Ian Gallagher doesn't
nag the shit outta my ass

53:56.011 --> 53:57.595
and tell me what to do
about somethin'!

53:57.595 --> 53:59.011
You know, if you just
wiped the toilet seat

53:59.011 --> 54:00.553
for once in your life,
I wouldn't fuckin' nag you.

54:00.553 --> 54:01.762
If you just, like, picked up
your nail clippings

54:01.762 --> 54:02.512
Who gives a shit
about any of that?

54:02.512 --> 54:03.679
We're in fuckin' prison!

54:03.679 --> 54:05.428
- I do, you fuckin' pig.
- That's the problem.

54:05.428 --> 54:07.261
You sound like
a couple of old broads.

54:07.261 --> 54:09.095
I'ma murder you two
if you don't stop talkin'.

54:19.845 --> 54:21.553
Hi, Frank.

54:22.470 --> 54:24.512
Give us a hand here,
would you, kid?

54:27.011 --> 54:29.261
Hey, Frank, do you know
who banged a black person

54:29.261 --> 54:30.970
in our family lineage?

54:30.970 --> 54:34.220
Yeah, someone from your
mother's grandfather's

54:34.220 --> 54:36.970
side of the family
had a mistress.

54:36.970 --> 54:38.845
- And she was black?
- She is black.

54:38.845 --> 54:40.512
She's still alive?

54:40.512 --> 54:42.220
Lives down the street.

54:42.220 --> 54:43.553
What?

54:51.136 --> 54:53.595
Why didn't you tell me?

54:55.136 --> 54:56.261
Get away from the house,
Frank.

54:56.261 --> 54:57.595
You know the rules.

55:00.887 --> 55:02.303
That's why, son.
