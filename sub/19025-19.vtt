00:02.250 --> 00:04.000
(J.D.)
<i>I can't stop thinkin' about last night.</i>

00:04.500 --> 00:07.333
<i>I mean, it's incredible</i>
<i>how fast things can go</i>

00:07.417 --> 00:09.291
<i>from amazing to complete disaster.</i>

00:09.375 --> 00:10.458
(knock on door)

00:11.417 --> 00:12.458
-Sean?
-Sean?

00:12.542 --> 00:14.417
I have been looking all over for you.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.750
What are you doin' back from New Zealand?

00:17.375 --> 00:19.166
(giggling)

00:26.375 --> 00:27.208
Morning.

00:27.291 --> 00:28.458
What's up with him?

00:29.417 --> 00:31.166
He slept with Elliot last night.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.583
It's<i> that </i>time of year again.

00:32.667 --> 00:36.125
Dude, ignore her. That's 3 years in a row.
Who's feeling you?

00:36.667 --> 00:38.333
-You be.
-(snorts)

00:38.417 --> 00:39.542
She's already back with Sean.

00:39.625 --> 00:40.959
How soon after you guys hooked up?

00:41.041 --> 00:43.083
-About 90 seconds.
-Ooh.

00:43.792 --> 00:44.625
What should I do?

00:45.500 --> 00:46.583
(J.D.) <i>That was a huge mistake...</i>

00:46.667 --> 00:49.083
<i>Because the closer</i>
<i>Turk and Carla got to their wedding,</i>

00:49.166 --> 00:51.125
<i>the more they became</i>
<i>one of those annoying couples</i>

00:51.208 --> 00:53.542
<i>that thought they knew</i>
<i>everything about relationships.</i>

00:54.125 --> 00:55.375
-Look, J.D...
-Look, J.D...

00:56.000 --> 00:56.959
You first, honey.

00:57.041 --> 00:59.792
J.D., love is like a butterfly.

01:00.250 --> 01:03.000
Hold it too tight,
and... you'll crush it...

01:04.041 --> 01:05.709
Too loose, and it flies away.

01:05.792 --> 01:06.875
(sighs)

01:12.000 --> 01:14.500
(telephone rings)

01:14.583 --> 01:17.750
(J.D.) <i>The phone call was Elliot</i>
<i>asking me to meet her so we could talk.</i>

01:17.834 --> 01:18.667
<i>I was nervous,</i>

01:18.750 --> 01:22.041
<i>but I felt better the moment I saw</i>
<i>good old Irv at the security gate.</i>

01:22.125 --> 01:22.959
Irv.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.917
Howdy, Dr. Dorian.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
(cute action music)

01:39.625 --> 01:40.917
I'm sorry, sir...

01:41.000 --> 01:43.709
But there's no parking allowed
at the emergency curb.

01:43.792 --> 01:47.667
But I'd be happy to park your car for you
and run the keys up to you in a jiff.

01:47.750 --> 01:51.375
Yeah... Except this is my only set,
and I'm afraid you might eat them.

01:51.458 --> 01:53.041
Okay? See ya, Tubbs.

01:55.542 --> 01:59.000
I've been tryin' like the dickens
to cut down on my snacking, but it just...

01:59.083 --> 02:02.125
Epp, epp, epp... You look great, Irv.

02:02.709 --> 02:05.250
(J.D.)<i> Irv </i>didn't<i> look great,</i>
<i>but I didn't have time to talk.</i>

02:05.834 --> 02:06.709
Danni?

02:07.291 --> 02:08.959
(J.D.) <i>When you run into someone</i>
<i>you used to date,</i>

02:09.041 --> 02:11.917
<i>either you find them totally annoying,</i>
<i>or enough time has passed</i>

02:12.000 --> 02:13.583
<i>that you've idealized</i>
<i>everything about them.</i>

02:13.667 --> 02:14.625
Hey, J.D.

02:14.709 --> 02:15.917
(J.D.) <i>"Hey, J.D."</i>

02:16.375 --> 02:18.458
I'm actually on my way
to see somebody, so I gotta...

02:18.542 --> 02:19.959
Oh, okay. I'll see you later.

02:20.709 --> 02:21.875
(J.D.) <i>Oh, be nice.</i>

02:21.959 --> 02:22.834
Danni, wait.

02:25.375 --> 02:26.375
How've you been?

02:26.458 --> 02:28.834
-Well, actually I...
-Ooh. Gotta go.

02:28.917 --> 02:30.792
(J.D.) <i>And there she was... My lady.</i>

02:30.875 --> 02:31.875
Hey, Elliot.

02:32.625 --> 02:34.125
J.D., I can't talk right now.

02:34.709 --> 02:36.792
Shall we just hold each other?

02:36.875 --> 02:39.333
Sorry. Sorry.
I couldn't find a parking spot.

02:39.417 --> 02:40.750
(chuckles)

02:42.458 --> 02:43.792
Hey, J.D. What's up?

02:44.375 --> 02:45.208
What's up?

02:45.875 --> 02:48.542
Attention, Sacred Heart.
Everyone, please gather around.

02:48.625 --> 02:50.750
Doctors, nurses, patients,
hear ye, hear ye.

02:50.834 --> 02:54.667
Everyone should know that last night,
Elliot Reid and I made passionate love

02:54.750 --> 02:56.166
for a good hour and a half.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.667
Check that. A<i> great </i>hour and a half.

02:58.750 --> 02:59.792
-Ooh. Ooh.
-Mmm...

02:59.875 --> 03:00.792
(chuckles)

03:00.875 --> 03:02.458
No, I can't... I can't do it.

03:02.542 --> 03:03.834
That is all.

03:08.417 --> 03:10.333
Aw. Bambi freeze up again?

03:10.417 --> 03:11.792
It's not our problem, honey.

03:11.875 --> 03:12.792
Ohhh...

03:13.792 --> 03:17.500
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

03:17.583 --> 03:20.291
<i>♪ No, I know I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:24.000 --> 03:25.625
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:32.875 --> 03:35.834
-You've got something on your face.
-What?

03:35.917 --> 03:37.166
(J.D.) <i>The love of my life.</i>

03:37.250 --> 03:38.375
You got it.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.542
So, I'll see you after work.

03:40.625 --> 03:41.875
Okay.
(chuckles)

03:42.458 --> 03:43.333
Bye, J.D.

03:43.417 --> 03:44.917
Peace out, Sean.

03:45.500 --> 03:49.959
Listen... J.D.,
last night was really important to me.

03:50.333 --> 03:51.166
I know.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.583
I mean, you don't want to be rusty at sex

03:53.667 --> 03:56.208
before you throw down
with your real boyfriend, do you?

03:56.291 --> 03:57.792
Look, you and I
have been down this road before,

03:57.875 --> 03:59.291
and we both know where it ends.

04:00.166 --> 04:03.542
I'm sorry. I just...
I really want to make this work with Sean.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.417
So... please don't say anything to him.
Okay?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.625
I totally understand. You know...

04:09.166 --> 04:11.000
Danni and I are gettin' back together,
too.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.333
(J.D.) <i>We are?</i>

04:12.417 --> 04:16.417
Danni? Danni... Danni... Danni...
What's her last name?

04:16.500 --> 04:17.875
(J.D.) <i>Damn! I should know this.</i>

04:17.959 --> 04:20.125
-Blond hair!
-Yes. Raspy voice.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.250
Oh, yeah.
That incision's healing up nicely.

04:24.667 --> 04:25.875
Thanks again, Dr. Miller.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.834
I'm gonna have my band
write a song about you.

04:28.917 --> 04:31.542
Well... I'm glad I struck a chord.
(chuckles)

04:31.625 --> 04:33.166
(both laugh)

04:33.250 --> 04:35.625
Yeah, listen,
while you were proving once and for all

04:35.709 --> 04:37.834
that pretty girls do not, in fact,
need to be funny,

04:37.917 --> 04:41.417
I went ahead and took a look
at your little rock star's chart.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.291
-Oh, did you?
-Yes, I did.

04:43.375 --> 04:46.917
And his urine output is dropping,
so you should probably start him on Lasix.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.417
You amuse me.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.041
So even though he's post-op
and still technically my patient,

04:51.125 --> 04:54.792
I'm gonna pretend to consider your opinion
before I walk away and do whatever I want.

04:54.875 --> 04:56.375
Hmm. No.

04:57.959 --> 04:58.959
(makes explosion sound)

05:03.625 --> 05:07.041
(loud beeping)

05:08.709 --> 05:10.208
-Are you all right?
-Are you all right?

05:10.875 --> 05:13.583
Some hooligan keeps disconnecting
the alarm.

05:15.083 --> 05:18.041
Unhh! I told security to look into it...

05:18.125 --> 05:20.792
But no, no. They'd rather catch the guy

05:20.875 --> 05:22.750
who's stealin' organs
from the transplant ward.

05:22.834 --> 05:23.667
(sniffles)

05:24.375 --> 05:27.500
If I was a security guard around here,
things would be different.

05:27.583 --> 05:29.250
You really want to be a security guard?

05:29.333 --> 05:33.208
Who around here commands more respect
than the men who wear blue and green?

05:33.291 --> 05:35.041
The uniforms are black and gray.

05:35.125 --> 05:37.625
You got me.
I don't see colors well. Happy now?

05:37.709 --> 05:41.375
Look, if you're really into security,
Irv's position just opened up.

05:41.458 --> 05:42.417
What happened to Irv?

05:49.083 --> 05:50.125
Tubbs?

05:50.208 --> 05:52.125
Aah! Who's tubby now?

05:52.208 --> 05:53.792
-Ha ha ha ha!
-Irv! Stop it!

05:53.875 --> 05:54.792
Uhh!

05:54.875 --> 05:57.083
(indistinct fighting shouts)

05:57.166 --> 05:58.875
So I'm tubby, huh?!

05:58.959 --> 06:01.625
-Unhh! Ohh!
-Uhhh... Okay.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.000
(gasping)

06:03.083 --> 06:04.125
(coughs)

06:04.917 --> 06:06.375
He had to be let go.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.542
(J.D.) <i>Okay, Elliot really hurt me.</i>

06:11.625 --> 06:13.458
<i>Still, right now,</i>
<i>I need to keep a level head.</i>

06:13.542 --> 06:15.208
<i>My emotions are all over the place,</i>

06:15.291 --> 06:17.125
<i>and it's important</i>
<i>that I don't do anything rash.</i>

06:17.834 --> 06:19.792
(coughing)

06:19.875 --> 06:21.250
Do you have to do that here?

06:21.333 --> 06:23.625
What? I like smoking after sex.

06:23.709 --> 06:24.583
And during.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.917
God, you never used to smoke.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.750
Yeah, but back then,
I was pretendin' to be someone

06:28.834 --> 06:30.000
that I thought you wanted me to be.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.417
<i>That </i>didn't work. So now...

06:33.291 --> 06:34.583
(coughs)

06:34.667 --> 06:36.458
I'm gonna let the real me come out.

06:36.542 --> 06:40.291
And the real me wants to do it again,
and she wants to do it rough.

06:40.417 --> 06:42.208
Oh, I don't know, Danni.

06:42.291 --> 06:44.083
The real me's not really into that.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.875
-Give it to me!
-Aah!

06:46.834 --> 06:49.000
Oh, my God, Danni, I'm so sorry.
I thought that's what you wanted.

06:49.083 --> 06:50.083
It was.

06:50.667 --> 06:52.458
Yaaahhhh!

06:53.250 --> 06:54.458
-(crying)
-Quick question.

06:54.542 --> 06:56.166
Will my son ever stop crying?

06:56.250 --> 06:59.291
-(loud crying)
-(mutters)

06:59.375 --> 07:03.500
You know what's so sweet?
This morning, Jack called her da da.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.291
Um, I'm... I'm sorry.

07:05.375 --> 07:07.625
Look,
there's a new doctor at the hospital,

07:07.709 --> 07:11.417
and she is such a relentless chore
that every time she's harpin' at me,

07:11.500 --> 07:13.458
I actually see your face.

07:13.542 --> 07:16.041
I love that you think about me at work.

07:16.125 --> 07:19.166
Honestly, Jordan,
I've never despised anyone more.

07:21.291 --> 07:22.750
Oh, my God. You have a crush on her.

07:23.333 --> 07:24.333
Who said who to what now?

07:24.417 --> 07:26.333
It is so typical.

07:26.417 --> 07:27.875
We have an amazing son.

07:27.959 --> 07:29.959
We're totally getting along for a change.

07:30.041 --> 07:33.333
But that's too boring for you.
It's too nice.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.250
So you have to go
and blow the whole thing up, don't you?

07:35.333 --> 07:39.542
Well, brav-o, Perry. Oh, fantastic.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.750
Now, I know you say
you love us all equally...

07:44.375 --> 07:45.917
But you don't... Do you?

07:46.917 --> 07:47.917
I'm onto you, big man.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.375
Oh, ho ho. Mmm...

07:50.792 --> 07:53.333
And this badge is now yours.

07:53.917 --> 07:55.542
I just want to thank you
for believing in me.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.208
And I want to assure you that I'm gonna be
guarding these hospital gates

07:58.291 --> 08:00.250
the way Cerberus
guarded the gates of hell.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.000
Yeah. That's terrific.

08:02.834 --> 08:03.834
Huh?

08:03.917 --> 08:06.166
Look at you in your new uniform.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.667
And they gave you a nightstick?

08:07.750 --> 08:09.625
Well, actually, this is my dad's.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.208
He used to use this baby
every day at work.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.417
-Unhh! Yahh!
-Was he a cop?

08:14.500 --> 08:15.834
Uh, no. Cat trainer.

08:15.917 --> 08:17.667
-Mmm.
-Oh.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.417
Meow.

08:23.083 --> 08:23.917
That way.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.000
Shh.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.125
(whispering)
You stay here. I'll go.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.959
(J.D.)
<i>I felt bad about hooking up with Danni,</i>

08:33.041 --> 08:34.166
<i>but luckily, no one knew.</i>

08:34.250 --> 08:35.166
You want any water?

08:37.583 --> 08:39.208
Well? Do you guys?

08:39.291 --> 08:42.166
Bambi.
We know you were in there with Danni.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.291
We heard you say her name.

08:43.375 --> 08:47.667
Oh, no. No. I was... I was in there
with my buddy Danny from the gym.

08:47.750 --> 08:50.375
But we heard you say,
"Take it all, Danni."

08:51.000 --> 08:53.375
He's a... really... good buddy.

08:57.208 --> 08:59.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.875
Movin' a little quick there,
aren't we, bub?

09:01.959 --> 09:03.583
Got a story to tell me?

09:03.667 --> 09:04.709
<i>Here's </i>a story...

09:05.375 --> 09:08.667
it's called <i>The Security Guard Who Was</i>
<i>Sodomized With His Own Nightstick.</i>

09:08.750 --> 09:11.083
Why don't we just consider this a warning.

09:12.417 --> 09:13.458
Yeah.

09:13.542 --> 09:14.375
(muffled explosion)

09:15.834 --> 09:18.041
My cousin's a bank teller,

09:18.125 --> 09:20.291
and he gave me one
of those exploding ink cartridges

09:20.375 --> 09:22.709
they put in stolen money
so I could figure out

09:22.792 --> 09:24.959
who's been disconnecting
the emergency exits.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.083
Nice work.

09:29.458 --> 09:31.375
Okay. That's all for me, Jeff.

09:31.458 --> 09:34.125
Any other questions you might have
you can direct to Dr. Cox here.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.834
I'm sure you'll find him to be quite...
something.

09:36.917 --> 09:37.917
Hi.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.500
You think it's cool
if I broke out tomorrow

09:39.583 --> 09:41.041
and play a set with the band?

09:41.125 --> 09:42.667
They're goin' on tour in Europe,

09:42.750 --> 09:45.000
and I won't get a chance
to play with them for a whole year.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.792
I think we can work somethin' out.

09:47.709 --> 09:50.000
Don't worry about it.
I will drive him out there myself.

09:50.083 --> 09:52.291
He can play with his friends for an hour,
and then I'll drive him back.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.083
I<i> won't </i>worry about it,
mostly because he's not goin'. You see...

09:55.166 --> 09:56.792
I'm his doctor now.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.542
Oho. I didn't listen to you before,

09:58.625 --> 10:00.083
so now you're gonna take it out
on the patient.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.625
Look, I honestly don't think
that goin' to some dive bar

10:02.709 --> 10:05.750
is necessarily appropriate
for somebody who just had kidney surgery.

10:05.834 --> 10:08.542
Although... don't get me wrong...
the fact that it seems

10:08.625 --> 10:11.750
to be pissing you off so much
is the true definition of an added perk.

10:11.834 --> 10:14.208
Seriously. You can...
you can look it up in the dictionary.

10:14.291 --> 10:16.000
It's under "p" for "perk."

10:16.083 --> 10:17.667
It's right next to "pain in the ass,"

10:17.750 --> 10:19.792
and curiously enough,
your picture's right next to it.

10:22.834 --> 10:25.125
Bambi, when you broke up with Danni,

10:25.208 --> 10:27.583
you said it was the happiest day
of your life.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.166
No. That was only because
<i>Barney Miller </i>came out on DVD.

10:30.250 --> 10:33.208
And Wojo's commentary on it... priceless.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.792
Look, maybe Danni's not
the love of my life. All right?

10:35.875 --> 10:37.959
But she's... she's beautiful
and she's quirky,

10:38.041 --> 10:39.875
and she's... very sweet.

10:39.959 --> 10:43.333
Man, I get so gassy after havin' sex.

10:43.917 --> 10:44.834
-Mmm.
-Ehh...

10:44.917 --> 10:46.959
Oh, by the way,
some skank named Barbara called,

10:47.041 --> 10:48.250
and I told her to back off.

10:50.834 --> 10:51.750
Barbara's my mom.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.083
(J.D.) <i>In life,</i>
<i>there are personal realizations...</i>

10:55.500 --> 10:56.583
I hate my girlfriend.

10:58.667 --> 10:59.709
(J.D.) <i>And professional ones.</i>

10:59.792 --> 11:03.333
Listen, Serpico, I go 4 steps
out that door to my car every day,

11:03.417 --> 11:06.000
and that's important
because if I don't beat Enid home

11:06.083 --> 11:08.834
from her thighs and buns class,
I have to help her peel off her leotard.

11:08.917 --> 11:12.375
So remember this:
I hired you, and I can fire you.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.625
(J.D.) <i>But the worst are the realizations</i>
<i>that sneak up on you.</i>

11:23.709 --> 11:25.458
Ahem. Excuse me. I need to get a, uh...

11:25.542 --> 11:29.500
Book about supply closet etiquette?
Yeah, look, I'm kinda using this... area.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.500
Oh. Oh, you are so annoying.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.208
You must drive your wife insane.

11:33.750 --> 11:34.625
Are you married?

11:34.709 --> 11:37.208
(J.D.) <i>Like when you realize</i>
<i>you just might have a crush after all.</i>

11:37.917 --> 11:39.625
No. No, I'm not.

11:45.125 --> 11:47.458
(J.D.) <i>In a big hospital,</i>
<i>you can hide from almost anything...</i>

11:48.291 --> 11:49.375

11:49.458 --> 11:50.542
-Hello.
-Oh. Hey.

11:50.625 --> 11:51.542
Yeah, Jordan.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.917
-You know what's weird?
-Tell me.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.959
We're so close,
and yet if anybody asks if we're married,

11:57.041 --> 11:59.834
all either one of us can say is... Is no.

11:59.917 --> 12:02.917
Actually, I say we were married
for 5 years, then got divorced.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.500
Now we're back living together,
have a child,

12:04.583 --> 12:06.542
but we're in a long-term
committed relationship.

12:06.625 --> 12:10.000
Yeah, that's what I say, too.
That or... no.

12:10.083 --> 12:12.542
Oh... Mr. Midlife.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.083
We both know what this is about.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.417
And you should just go ahead
and enjoy your crush.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.125
Because, honestly, I don't care.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.208
I don't.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.875
-Mmm, mmm, mmm.
-Sad.

12:26.834 --> 12:27.792
Hey, Q-tip.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.750
Some girl who says she's your girlfriend's
on the phone.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.417
Oh. Uh...

12:32.500 --> 12:33.500
Tell her I'm not here.

12:34.291 --> 12:37.208
(both) Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm,
mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.458
Godspeed, sir.

12:46.542 --> 12:49.667
-(both) Mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.
-What? I'm in a pickle!

12:50.542 --> 12:51.834
A pickle!

12:59.458 --> 13:00.583
(both slurping)

13:02.250 --> 13:04.166
(both) Mmmmm! Mmmmm!

13:04.250 --> 13:06.208
(distant laughter)

13:06.291 --> 13:07.750
-Hey, you wanna play darts?
-Sure.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.333
Great. Have fun. I'll be over here.

13:10.166 --> 13:12.208
Do you even enjoy spending time with me?

13:13.250 --> 13:15.500
"Enjoy" is such a strong word.

13:15.583 --> 13:17.834
I... I'm used to it.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.750
You know, like... cafeteria food or...

13:20.834 --> 13:22.792
The constant threat of terrorism.

13:23.834 --> 13:26.375
But you don't...
Enjoy hangin' out with<i> me, </i>do you?

13:26.458 --> 13:29.125
Not really.
I'm more into tough guys. You know?

13:29.208 --> 13:31.250
Last night in bed,
I knocked you unconscious.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.166
For, like, 5 seconds.

13:33.750 --> 13:35.250
So I guess... this is over.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.333
Why?

13:36.917 --> 13:40.166
So you'd rather hang out with someone
you don't even like than be alone?

13:40.250 --> 13:41.625
Yeah, pretty much.

13:41.709 --> 13:43.125
Yeah, me, too.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.959
I mean, come on, how many couples
out there actually have fun together?

13:47.709 --> 13:51.750
Guys... Elliot and I are in the middle
of a marathon game of hide-and-go-seek.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.792
If she comes in... you didn't see me.

13:56.458 --> 13:57.417
99...

13:58.000 --> 13:58.792
100!

13:59.375 --> 14:00.333
Have you guys seen Sean?

14:00.417 --> 14:01.417
Yeah, he's r...

14:02.750 --> 14:03.583
Where'd he go?

14:06.625 --> 14:09.166
Oh, he's a dynamite hider.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.166
(both) Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm,
mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm.

14:13.250 --> 14:16.291
Oh, don't even start, Tarla or... Curk,

14:16.375 --> 14:19.500
or whatever you're callin' this
little 2-headed judgmental freak show.

14:19.583 --> 14:20.834
Why don't I do a little piece for you

14:20.917 --> 14:24.417
I like to call
<i>Your First Year Of Marriage.</i>

14:24.500 --> 14:28.750
"I do." "Oh, kiss, kiss, kiss."
"Why can't we have a baby?"

14:28.834 --> 14:30.458
"Why you spendin' so much money
on clothes?"

14:30.542 --> 14:31.959
"Why you sleepin' with my sister?"

14:32.041 --> 14:33.542
"Why can't I hang out with my peeps?"

14:33.625 --> 14:35.709
(makes explosion sound)

14:36.458 --> 14:37.583
-Baby...
-Hmm?

14:37.667 --> 14:39.291
I would never sleep with your sister.

14:39.709 --> 14:40.500
She's hideous.

14:40.583 --> 14:43.750
And I would never have a crush
on someone else.

14:43.834 --> 14:45.750
I do not have a crush.

14:45.834 --> 14:46.667
What is<i> this?</i>

14:46.750 --> 14:50.125
That is a form allowing
Mr. Stockton's band to come visit him

14:50.208 --> 14:53.083
so that Dr. Miller will be happy
that I did a nice thing for her.

14:53.166 --> 14:54.333
(makes whining sound)

14:54.417 --> 14:57.750
Turk, he wants to be with Dr. Miller
because he thinks it'll make him what?

14:57.834 --> 14:59.208
-Happy.
-Exactly.

14:59.291 --> 15:01.750
-But he's really only happy when he's...
-Miserable.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.250
Right. So why does he really want
to be with Dr. Miller?

15:04.333 --> 15:06.750
'Cause she got big-ass boobies.

15:06.834 --> 15:09.333
No, no, no.
Because he likes being miserable.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.333
If I actually enjoyed being miserable,

15:11.417 --> 15:13.709
then why wouldn't I stay here
talking to you two?

15:13.792 --> 15:14.959
(whistles)

15:18.875 --> 15:21.959
(J.D.) <i>Okay, let's see how Elliot likes it</i>
<i>when I'm all over my lady.</i>

15:22.500 --> 15:24.417
Hey. I've got something for you.

15:25.000 --> 15:25.834
What?

15:36.208 --> 15:38.375
(sputtering and coughing)

15:38.458 --> 15:40.417
Okay, I'm gonna buy the next round.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.291
Which one of you handsome boys
want to help me carry it?

15:42.375 --> 15:44.500
We're both good-looking guys. Am I right?

15:44.583 --> 15:47.625
-We'll sort this out when I get back.
-Okay, sort away, Seanny Sean Sean.

15:47.709 --> 15:48.542
Oh, God.

15:48.625 --> 15:49.959
How could you do this to me?

15:50.041 --> 15:51.667
-Do... what?
-Oh, I don't know.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.542
Come over to my house, sleep with me,
and then dump me the minute Sean shows up

15:54.625 --> 15:56.500
so I feel like a complete loser.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.917
Oh, you seem real crushed.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.667
I mean, you jumped into bed with Danni
so quick,

15:59.750 --> 16:01.125
you didn't have time to change the sheets.

16:01.208 --> 16:02.542
You know I only have one set.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.333
Look. J.D., can I ask you a favor?

16:04.375 --> 16:05.458
Can I ask<i> you </i>one?

16:05.542 --> 16:07.083
Sure. Anything. What is it?

16:07.166 --> 16:08.709
(J.D.) <i>Damn. I don't have one.</i>

16:08.792 --> 16:10.542
Didn't have one, did ya?

16:11.500 --> 16:12.917
Look, Elliot, what do you want?

16:13.917 --> 16:16.417
How about you rememberin'
that you're supposed to be my friend?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.166
Why'd you page me? What do you want?

16:25.250 --> 16:28.041
Just, uh... Just watch his face.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.583
No way.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.000
-How you feelin'?
-Hey, Rick...

16:32.083 --> 16:34.166
Audrey, Ryan, Tim,

16:34.250 --> 16:36.125
Jamie... Toby.

16:36.208 --> 16:37.583
-Hey, Jeff.
-Joe.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.375
(all laughing and chatting)

16:39.458 --> 16:40.542
(excited chatter)

16:40.625 --> 16:42.041
I hope this won't be awkward for you,

16:42.125 --> 16:44.375
but I promised the whole band
you'd have sex with them.

16:45.291 --> 16:47.000
(clapping and chatter)

16:48.166 --> 16:49.333
Don't look at me like that.

16:49.959 --> 16:51.250
This is your fault, anyway.

16:52.375 --> 16:53.917
You two made me dream again.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.917
Hey, we weren't the ones
who caved in to Kelso.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.083
I do not owe you an explanation for that.

16:58.166 --> 17:00.041
You're right.
You don't owe<i> us </i>an explanation.

17:00.125 --> 17:01.542
Lay some truth on him, baby.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.667
-You owe one to yourself.
-Ouch.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.583
Now I'm gonna let my husband-to-be
tell you what life's really all about

17:06.667 --> 17:09.000
