WEBVTT

00:03.528 --> 00:07.405
Get ready to hear the scariest
story you've ever heard.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.250
Is it the one about Gladys
skinny dipping in the lake?

00:11.987 --> 00:15.088
If you listen closely, you can
still hear the fish screaming.

00:17.834 --> 00:21.845
No! It's the tale
of my ancestor, Olga.

00:21.880 --> 00:26.366
The daughter of Kikiwaka
founder, Jedediah Swearengen.

00:26.402 --> 00:29.911
Olga was the camp fox.
Much like me.

00:29.947 --> 00:32.107
This story just went
from scary to delusional.

00:34.318 --> 00:36.827
But Olga loved
another counselor, Roland,

00:36.829 --> 00:39.846
and they used to meet
in secret at the tool shed.

00:39.881 --> 00:43.783
Nothing says romance
like rat poison.

00:43.819 --> 00:47.061
Roland would bring Olga candy, and they
would signal each other with a whistle.

00:47.097 --> 00:50.699
(GASPS) That's a good idea. Our duck
calls draw way too much attention.

00:50.734 --> 00:54.011
Specifically, from ducks.

00:54.013 --> 00:56.979
But a camper told Jedediah
about their meetings,

00:57.015 --> 01:00.184
so Jedediah sent Roland away.

01:00.186 --> 01:03.604
Soon after, Olga ran away
to elope with Roland.

01:03.606 --> 01:05.463
But a freak storm hit,
trapping her in the woods!

01:05.499 --> 01:10.226
And she died there. Cold,
bitter, and without a man.

01:10.262 --> 01:11.502
Like Gladys on Saturday nights.

01:14.066 --> 01:17.308
Legend has it, on stormy
summer nights,

01:17.344 --> 01:20.937
Olga's ghost returns,
whistling in the wind.

01:20.972 --> 01:23.665
She haunts Camp Kikiwaka,

01:23.667 --> 01:26.634
seeking revenge on campers
for telling her father

01:26.670 --> 01:28.128
by snatching them in the night...
(GASPS)

01:28.163 --> 01:29.705
Feeding off their fear

01:29.740 --> 01:32.574
and their legs!

01:32.610 --> 01:36.711
Oh, no! Next to my hair, my
legs are my best feature.

01:39.357 --> 01:41.397
So heed this warning.
If you hear a whistle...

01:42.502 --> 01:43.952
Run.

01:43.987 --> 01:45.667
(WHISTLING) (SCREAMING)

01:51.036 --> 01:54.396
(CHUCKLES) Nailed it, Hazel! We really
scared the pants off those campers.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.607
Jorge, put your pants back on!

01:59.502 --> 02:01.862
Huh, he really does
have nice legs.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.007
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

02:06.043 --> 02:08.810
<i>¶ We're leaving the city
behind right now</i>

02:08.845 --> 02:10.779
<i>¶ Let's gather by
the campfire light</i>

02:10.814 --> 02:12.723

02:12.758 --> 02:13.832

02:18.121 --> 02:21.189

02:21.225 --> 02:22.816

(CAMERA CLICKS)

02:59.813 --> 03:00.937
TIFFANY: Don't go!

03:00.973 --> 03:03.381
Tiffany, I know you're scared,

03:03.416 --> 03:05.024
but you can't come
to the bathroom with me.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.252
It's okay, I'll close my eyes.

03:07.287 --> 03:10.138
Never mind, I'll hold it.

03:10.173 --> 03:12.073
And you should know
ghosts don't exist.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.950
I thought you believed
in that thing...

03:13.986 --> 03:14.818
You have to take it in school,

03:14.853 --> 03:18.572
with those wrinkly white coats
and ugly goggles...

03:18.607 --> 03:20.327
Science? Oh, that's the one.

03:21.968 --> 03:24.161
I do. And Einstein proved

03:24.196 --> 03:25.836
that energy can't
be created or destroyed.

03:25.864 --> 03:30.183
So what does that energy
become when we die? Ghosts.

03:30.218 --> 03:34.046
Yeah, I see ghosts
in New York all the time.

03:34.048 --> 03:37.039
Blank stares on their faces,
moaning creepily...

03:37.075 --> 03:38.208
Zuri, those are models.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.171
Guys, there's no such
thing as ghosts.

03:43.206 --> 03:44.789
I don't know.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.175
That story about Olga
really freaked me out.

03:47.211 --> 03:51.946
You thought that was scary? I once found
a loose thread on my favorite sweater.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.190
I kept pulling and pulling...

03:54.225 --> 03:55.976
And then, there was no sweater!

03:58.713 --> 04:02.590
She also gets freaked out when
ice disappears in her drink.

04:02.626 --> 04:03.626
Where does it go?

04:07.706 --> 04:09.447
(SNORING)

04:14.238 --> 04:18.097
Jorge, is this really necessary?

04:18.133 --> 04:20.792
Yes! I'm scared Olga's
gonna get me!

04:20.827 --> 04:22.907
And I am scared of getting
athletes' face.

04:25.106 --> 04:29.042
Well, no offense, but
your sheets smell weird.

04:29.077 --> 04:31.669
That is called detergent.

04:31.705 --> 04:35.690
Do not worry, Jorge, the
ghost of Olga is not coming.

04:35.725 --> 04:36.899
No need to be scared.

04:36.935 --> 04:39.802
Then why did you run away screaming
when we heard the whistle?

04:39.837 --> 04:42.837
Everyone else was doing it, and
I am a natural-born follower.

04:44.434 --> 04:48.136
But trust me, that was
just a silly ghost story.

04:48.171 --> 04:50.680
Oh. So, there wasn't
really an Olga?

04:50.716 --> 04:52.156
Oh, no, there was.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.574
And did that storm
really happen?

04:53.610 --> 04:55.090
Big time.
It was a record-breaker.

04:57.439 --> 04:59.790
So, Olga did die alone
in the woods?

04:59.825 --> 05:01.708
No, not alone.

05:01.743 --> 05:04.728
I'm sure there was a family of
bears feeding on her corpse.

05:04.763 --> 05:05.763
(WHIMPERS)

05:07.824 --> 05:10.064
I am not very good
at this, am I?

05:10.427 --> 05:13.203
(WHISTLING)

05:13.238 --> 05:16.706
JORGE: Ahhh!
Olga's whistling again!

05:16.741 --> 05:21.061
Ravi, hold me! RAVI: Fine,
but you must shower first.

05:21.096 --> 05:23.422
(ALL CHUCKLING)

05:23.457 --> 05:26.608
That was some mighty fine
lip tootin', Hazel. Thanks.

05:26.643 --> 05:30.579
You know, Xander, my lips
are good for kissing, too.

05:30.614 --> 05:33.281
You're supposed to be scaring
the campers, not me.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.807
(GROANS) Rise and shine!

05:41.842 --> 05:44.142
Chuck-a-doodle-doo!

05:44.178 --> 05:46.578
Ugh, I have a giant knot
in my back.

05:46.613 --> 05:47.813
That's my elbow.

05:49.424 --> 05:51.465
Why didn't one of you
sleep with Lou?

05:51.501 --> 05:54.494
Because she's a kicker.

05:54.529 --> 05:56.849
Well, if you don't get out,
then I'm gonna be a puncher.

05:58.708 --> 06:01.301
Hey...

06:01.336 --> 06:03.353
Where did all this dirt
come from?

06:03.388 --> 06:06.147
Maybe something got
in here last night.

06:06.183 --> 06:08.216
You mean like a raccoon?

06:08.251 --> 06:10.202
TIFFANY: But, those
are high-heel shoe prints.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.037
Maybe the raccoon
was going out on a date!

06:14.500 --> 06:16.983
And look at these letters
scratched on the door!

06:17.018 --> 06:18.392
So the raccoon can spell?

06:18.428 --> 06:19.668
Forget the raccoon!

06:21.098 --> 06:24.458
O-L-G-A?

06:24.493 --> 06:25.750
(SCREAMS) Olga!

06:25.786 --> 06:27.193
(DOOR OPENS) (GASPS)

06:27.228 --> 06:29.904
Guys, we were haunted
last night!

06:29.940 --> 06:31.573
Us, too!

06:31.608 --> 06:33.088
Man, that ghost
really gets around.

06:33.886 --> 06:35.385
I'm so scared!

06:37.005 --> 06:39.472
(CHUCKLES) Look, a bra.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.153
Olga obviously had
a restless night.

06:45.188 --> 06:47.272
She's not the only one.

06:47.307 --> 06:51.493
Hey, Lou, isn't there supposed
to be a storm tonight?

06:51.495 --> 06:54.195
(GASPS) Jeepers creepers,
Xander, you're right.

06:54.231 --> 06:56.714
Olga's coming back for revenge!

06:56.750 --> 06:59.284
She's gonna rip our legs off,

06:59.319 --> 07:01.945
dip them in honey mustard,
and eat them!

07:01.980 --> 07:04.330
Jorge, that is ridiculous.

07:04.365 --> 07:06.845
Yeah, everyone knows
ghosts prefer ranch!

07:11.807 --> 07:14.657
Oh, uh, guys,
we need to talk to you.

07:14.692 --> 07:17.260
Were you guys haunted
by Olga last night, too?

07:17.296 --> 07:18.887
Yup. We were way mega haunted!

07:21.517 --> 07:22.517
Dial it down.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.143
All right, guys, admit it.

07:25.178 --> 07:28.171
You're behind the ghost
pranks, and it's gone too far.

07:28.206 --> 07:29.564
You're making
the campers miserable.

07:29.599 --> 07:33.026
And me! You try sleeping while Jorge
turns your bed into a fart fort.

07:34.629 --> 07:38.089
Okay, okay, but the Olga story
is a really fun tradition.

07:38.124 --> 07:42.127
Our first year, the counselors
scared us so bad, I peed my pants.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.762
I remember.
You were sitting on my bed.

07:46.124 --> 07:47.565
I wasn't that scared.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.592
You were crying for a week!

07:48.627 --> 07:52.203
Pfft! I was upset about
my guitar string breaking.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.806
You told me it was because
you lost your favorite sock.

07:54.841 --> 07:58.943
There was a lot going on!
It was an emotional time!

07:58.978 --> 08:03.698
Guys, forget Xander's guitar-sock trauma.
You need to stop this.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.568
Why should we stop just because
some whiny CITs tell us to?

08:07.603 --> 08:09.303
Okay, do what you want.

08:09.339 --> 08:11.798
But Xander, I'll have to
comfort Zuri and Tiffany,

08:11.833 --> 08:14.067
so I won't be able to go with
you to The Spot tonight.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.102
Prank's over!

08:18.940 --> 08:20.506
Well, I guess we'll set up
for breakfast,

08:20.542 --> 08:22.742
then not prank the kids.
Good times.

08:23.961 --> 08:27.171
Okay, that's weird. Look at
all those candy wrappers.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.032
I suppose you want us to believe that
Olga left those, because she loves candy.

08:30.067 --> 08:34.904
And no doubt "Olga" was the one
who wrote "Angry" on the canoe?

08:34.939 --> 08:36.447
Everybody's angry
in the mess hall.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.002
The apple juice
is just rusty water.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.871
Guys, I didn't do any of this.
Did one of you two go rogue?

08:43.906 --> 08:46.146
No way.
I would never betray you!

08:47.961 --> 08:50.044
Is that written in blood?

08:50.080 --> 08:54.941
Okay, I'm all for recreational
bloodshed, but this is messed up.

08:54.976 --> 08:58.036
Yeah, this is officially the creepiest
thing I've ever seen in here.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.554
And I once found
a book entitled,

08:59.589 --> 09:01.269
<i>How to Cook a Sick Racehorse.</i>

09:02.684 --> 09:04.524
Hmm, that explains
the Triple-Crown chowder.

09:07.514 --> 09:10.998
Well, if you guys didn't
do this, then who did?

09:11.034 --> 09:13.517
Maybe it really is Olga!

09:13.553 --> 09:14.719
Lou, there's no such
thing as ghosts.

09:14.754 --> 09:17.238
I'm sure there's a simple
explanation for all this.

09:17.273 --> 09:20.133
Yeah, the simple explanation
is, "Ghost mad, want to kill!"

09:27.484 --> 09:31.686
I just finished torturing...
I mean, questioning

09:31.721 --> 09:34.139
all the other campers,
counselors, and CITs.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.840
Everyone says they didn't do it.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.617
I'm telling you, it's Olga!
She loved candy,

09:37.653 --> 09:40.186
and she wrote "angry" on the canoe,
because her dad ruined her life.

09:40.221 --> 09:43.381
Can't she just get a tattoo, like
any other rebellious daughter?

09:44.742 --> 09:46.867
I still think we're just
being pranked.

09:46.903 --> 09:47.927
If we had surveillance cameras,

09:47.962 --> 09:50.655
we could set them up tonight,
after everyone else is asleep.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.331
Then, if
the guilty party returns,

09:52.367 --> 09:54.041
we could catch them red-handed.

09:54.076 --> 09:56.285
Hopefully not red-handed
from our blood!

09:56.320 --> 09:59.122
Where are we going to get a bunch of
cameras in the middle of nowhere?

09:59.157 --> 10:02.500
Actually, Gladys has a whole bunch
of cameras set up around the woods.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.844
She calls them
"Lumberjack Cams."

10:04.879 --> 10:07.119
Let's hope she doesn't have
the cameras at The Spot.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.302
Okay, I will go get
the cameras and set them up.

10:13.338 --> 10:17.306
If anything strange happens
tonight, we shall see it.

10:17.341 --> 10:20.661
The only thing we're gonna see is a
ghost coming down from a sugar high.

10:21.437 --> 10:24.688
Lou, how can you believe
some ghostly relative of mine

10:24.724 --> 10:26.715
is lurking around camp,
terrorizing kids?

10:26.751 --> 10:28.201
Uh, have you met your family?

10:33.182 --> 10:36.142
Uh-oh. Did you see
something suspicious?

10:36.178 --> 10:38.018
Nope, just a moose pooping
in a kayak.

10:40.314 --> 10:41.673
We all owe Jorge an apology.

10:45.495 --> 10:46.953
Okay, we've been here for hours,

10:46.988 --> 10:48.537
and all we've seen is
an incontinent moose.

10:48.573 --> 10:52.742
Yeah, we need to speed this up.
Good thing I'm a ghost whisperer.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.795
This better not be like the time you
said you were a bear whisperer.

10:55.830 --> 10:58.857
We were lucky to make it
out of that cave alive.

10:58.892 --> 11:02.485
If you can talk to ghosts, why
did you not mention it before?

11:02.520 --> 11:03.670
I didn't want you
to think I was weird.

11:03.705 --> 11:04.865
That ship has sailed.

11:07.625 --> 11:12.595
Anyway, back on the farm, I contacted
the spirit of my first pet pig, Snorty.

11:12.631 --> 11:14.905
And what did your
dead pig tell you?

11:14.941 --> 11:17.525
That's a sentence I never
thought I'd say.

11:17.560 --> 11:21.303
Turns out he was pretty peeved
about ending up as a BLT!

11:21.339 --> 11:25.199
The point is, if I can contact Snorty,
then maybe he can contact Olga.

11:25.234 --> 11:27.710
But what if Olga
doesn't speak oink?

11:27.746 --> 11:30.913
And that's something
I never thought I'd say.

11:30.949 --> 11:33.933
Okay, this won't work unless we're
all completely still and quiet.

11:35.787 --> 11:36.787
Soo-ee!

11:39.031 --> 11:42.111
Okay, you probably woke the
dead, and most of New England.

11:43.904 --> 11:47.989
Snorty, I know you're probably
steamed about gettin' smoked.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.453
But here get, piggy, piggy,
piggy, piggy, piggy!

11:55.749 --> 11:58.433
Soooo-eeee!

11:58.468 --> 12:01.544
The only thing she is going to conjure
up is an angry piece of bacon.

12:06.609 --> 12:07.609
(SNORES)

12:09.429 --> 12:11.880
Ow! I fell on something pointy.

12:11.915 --> 12:13.355
That's what's left
of my ribcage.

12:15.042 --> 12:16.417
Lou, are you okay?

12:16.452 --> 12:17.894
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

12:20.231 --> 12:22.857
I was having a nightmare
about Snorty.

12:22.892 --> 12:24.892
He was eating me
with lettuce and tomato.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.804
We were supposed
to be on ghost watch.

12:28.839 --> 12:31.140
I cannot believe
we all fell asleep!

12:31.175 --> 12:33.095
I can. These tables
are softer than our bunks.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.021
Guys, let's look at the footage
and see if we got anything.

12:42.211 --> 12:43.669
Wait! Did you see that?

12:46.941 --> 12:48.892
It's Olga! I told you, guys!

12:48.927 --> 12:52.269
No, it's not her. If it were,
she'd be whistling.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.971
(WHISTLING)

12:55.533 --> 12:57.433
Maybe it is Olga.

12:57.468 --> 13:01.154
I can't tell. Ravi is shaking the
screen too much because he's scared.

13:01.189 --> 13:03.389
While I am scared,
my arms are shaking

13:03.425 --> 13:06.267
because this tablet
is exceedingly heavy.

13:06.303 --> 13:08.820
Dude, you really should keep
these things to yourself.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.580
(DOOR OPENS)

13:11.615 --> 13:13.658
Guys, when we woke up,

13:13.693 --> 13:17.619
you weren't there, and now
our blankets are missing!

13:17.655 --> 13:19.313
We think Olga took them.

13:19.348 --> 13:20.998
Along with my fartin' quilt.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.961
Well, if she wasn't angry
before, she will be now.

13:27.198 --> 13:30.791
Maybe Olga did take them. She
was cold right before she died.

13:30.827 --> 13:35.904
Kids, we have some bad news.
The ghost of Olga is real!

13:35.940 --> 13:39.342
No duh. Welcome to yesterday!

13:39.377 --> 13:43.279
No, he means, before, we were just
pranking you guys with a ghost story,

13:43.281 --> 13:44.922
but now it has literally come
back to haunt us.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.907
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

13:46.943 --> 13:48.651
(SCREAMING)

13:50.997 --> 13:53.188
Olga's here! She's going
to start eating campers!

13:53.224 --> 13:54.991
This is horrible!
Wait, just campers, right?

14:02.517 --> 14:05.851
Guys, I called town for help, but they
told me the roads are washed out.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.711
And then the phone went dead!

14:07.747 --> 14:11.432
It's Olga! She's cut us off from the world,
so she can take us out of the world!

14:11.467 --> 14:12.467
Snorty, I'm a-comin'!

14:14.837 --> 14:16.877
Don't worry, Xander,
I'll keep you safe.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.775
This actually makes me
feel less safe.

14:21.952 --> 14:24.679
Perhaps Olga is benevolent.

14:24.714 --> 14:28.783
I don't care
what religion she is.

14:28.818 --> 14:31.252
She's gonna kill us.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

14:31.288 --> 14:33.720
I meant, she may just
be looking for our help.

14:33.756 --> 14:38.008
According to ghostologists, a
spirit only roams this mortal plane

14:38.044 --> 14:40.060
if it has unfinished business.

14:40.096 --> 14:44.039
Olga's unfinished business is that she
never got the chance to marry Roland!

14:44.074 --> 14:45.207
But how can we help
a ghost get married?

14:45.242 --> 14:47.960
And where will they honeymoon?
Death Valley? (LAUGHS)

14:50.456 --> 14:54.241
Obviously, we should throw a wedding,
and have someone stand in for Olga.

14:54.276 --> 14:56.594
Someone like
her descendant... Hazel.

15:00.024 --> 15:03.383
Oh, no! No, no, no!

15:03.419 --> 15:05.619
I'm not gonna be in some
freaky ghost wedding

15:05.655 --> 15:08.422
just to appease
a cranky dead chick.

15:08.457 --> 15:10.575
Xander could stand in
for Roland.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.703
<i>¶ Here comes the bride! ¶</i>

15:13.705 --> 15:16.185
This is gonna be a whole
new level of bridezilla.

15:19.319 --> 15:23.930
I really wish we'd had time for your
bachelor party. I had big plans.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.347
Like what?

15:25.383 --> 15:28.042
We were gonna be human chips,

15:28.078 --> 15:31.237
diving into a tub of queso dip!

15:31.272 --> 15:33.592
So, we finally know what it
takes to get you into a tub.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.732
Enough about the queso.
Let's put a ring on it.

15:39.088 --> 15:40.262
Let us begin.

15:42.333 --> 15:43.975
(PLAYING <i>BRIDAL MARCH)</i>

15:48.514 --> 15:50.289
Oh... Okay...

15:50.324 --> 15:53.800
I know you love making a mess,
but this is hardly the time.

15:53.836 --> 15:57.613
I'm the flower girl. And this
cauliflower is the best I could do!

16:02.103 --> 16:03.802
Don't be scared, Lou.
We're gonna be okay.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.229
No, I always cry at weddings!

16:05.264 --> 16:07.915
(SOBS) Even if the bride is
a vicious, vengeful she-devil.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.329
Lou, do not speak
of Olga that way!

16:13.364 --> 16:14.484
I was talking about Hazel.

16:15.967 --> 16:19.860
EMMA: I am not going out there
in Gladys' old prom dress!

16:19.896 --> 16:22.146
It's ugly, and it reeks
of tears and rejection!

16:22.181 --> 16:23.965
HAZEL: It's for
the good of the camp!

16:24.000 --> 16:25.683
Plus, it makes me look prettier!

16:25.718 --> 16:26.718
Oh!

16:29.213 --> 16:31.547
Here come the waterworks!

16:31.582 --> 16:32.742
Trust me, I wanna cry, too.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.527
(VIOLIN PLAYING WEDDING MARCH)

16:40.616 --> 16:42.158
Nice dress. Thanks.

16:42.193 --> 16:45.036
Gladys keeps it in case her pen
pal ever breaks out of prison.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.560
(GASPS)

16:55.823 --> 16:59.917
Friends, family, undead...

16:59.952 --> 17:04.805
We are gathered here to unite Olga
Swearengen with her lost love, Roland...

17:06.159 --> 17:07.433
Last name unknown.

17:09.553 --> 17:13.314
Please post all wedding pictures
with the tag "Rolgaforever."

17:15.543 --> 17:18.244
They were torn apart
100 years ago,

17:18.246 --> 17:22.073
and Olga is apparently
still quite peeved about it.

17:22.108 --> 17:25.188
Now, the dictionary defines marriage
as an equal... (THUNDER CRACKS)

17:28.681 --> 17:30.581
Wow, Ravi, even ghosts
think you talk too much.

17:32.869 --> 17:35.319
Message received, Olga.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.314
Now, we will quickly
hear the vows.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.308
Olga, I'm being you!

17:40.343 --> 17:44.545
And like you, I found a man
at camp who loves me.

17:44.580 --> 17:45.762
No, you didn't.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.682
And we are soulmates...

17:47.717 --> 17:49.817
No, we're not.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.768
Destined to walk beside
each other for eternity!

17:51.804 --> 17:53.044
You'll be walking alone.

17:55.257 --> 17:56.273
Okay...

17:57.735 --> 17:59.068
Now for Roland's vows.

18:01.338 --> 18:03.218
That... That's you. Oh!

18:03.633 --> 18:05.407
Right... I'll pass.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.912
Moving right along.

18:09.947 --> 18:13.749
Does anyone object to the
union of these two people?

18:13.784 --> 18:15.467
I do. Ditto.

18:15.502 --> 18:16.742
Then if no one objects,

18:18.806 --> 18:21.057
by the power not-vested in me,

18:21.092 --> 18:25.436
I pronounce you, Olga
and Roland, husband and wife.

18:25.471 --> 18:26.551
You may kiss the bride.

18:28.332 --> 18:30.549
Olga, please
don't make me do this!

18:30.585 --> 18:32.018
Show us a sign that
you're ready to move on!

18:32.053 --> 18:33.652

18:33.688 --> 18:34.812

18:38.701 --> 18:40.809
(GAGGING)

18:40.845 --> 18:45.122
(LAUGHS) Kissing you sure
beats kissing my Xander doll.

18:45.157 --> 18:46.582
Does anybody have any
soap I can eat?

18:46.618 --> 18:48.284
(WHISTLING)

18:51.947 --> 18:56.959
Oh, no! Olga's still here! The
wedding ceremony didn't work!

18:56.994 --> 18:59.920
Probably because Xander didn't kiss back.
Let's try again!

18:59.956 --> 19:00.862
Again, I have to object!

19:00.898 --> 19:01.898
So do I.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.551
Wait a minute, where's Jorge?

19:07.864 --> 19:09.622
Olga has taken him!

19:09.657 --> 19:12.683
She probably wanted someone
who smelled worse than her!

19:14.995 --> 19:16.835
We have to save Jorge
from that angry ghost!

19:18.090 --> 19:19.106
Do we?

19:22.728 --> 19:24.570
This seems more like
a counselor problem.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.672
Yeah, I kissed Hazel! I've
already tasted death tonight!

19:31.004 --> 19:32.210
Emma's right!
If we don't save Jorge,

19:32.246 --> 19:34.686
then he'll be haunting us with
ghost farts for all eternity.

19:40.154 --> 19:41.487
How do we know these
are Jorge's footprints?

19:41.522 --> 19:43.923
They're short, wide, and the
shoes are on the wrong feet.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.350
(WHISTLING)

19:46.386 --> 19:47.793

19:47.828 --> 19:49.670
EMMA: I think I see Jorge.

19:49.705 --> 19:54.183
But I can't see the ghost. Right.
That is kind of their thing.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.573
Look, Olga's leading him
into the tool shed!

20:00.608 --> 20:04.392
So she can get a shovel
and dig his grave! (SOBS)

20:04.428 --> 20:06.348
Or maybe she's just
totes into gardening?

20:09.300 --> 20:10.300
(GASPS)

20:13.145 --> 20:15.896
(SNORING) (WHISTLING)

20:15.931 --> 20:17.665
Wait, so Jorge
was just sleepwalking?

20:19.660 --> 20:20.927
This explains where
all our blankets went.

20:20.962 --> 20:24.496
And why there were candy
wrappers in the mess hall.

20:24.532 --> 20:26.340
And this jam must be
the blood on the canoe.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.032
This blood needs
a little peanut butter.

20:31.923 --> 20:34.898
So the ghost was Jorge?

20:34.934 --> 20:37.859
It must have been him in the camera
footage, wrapped in a blanket.

20:37.895 --> 20:41.688
And the whistle must have been
from Jorge's deviated septum.

20:41.723 --> 20:44.307
Sometimes he makes
that noise in his sleep.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.076
And you didn't think
to tell us this before?

20:46.111 --> 20:47.528
I am no gossip, madam!

20:49.681 --> 20:50.681
(YAWNS)

20:51.233 --> 20:52.233
Hi!

20:55.646 --> 20:58.230
What am I doing
in the tool shed?

20:58.265 --> 21:00.190
(GASPS) Did the ghost
bring me here?

21:00.225 --> 21:02.834
Did she turn my legs
into taquitos?

21:02.870 --> 21:05.195
No, Jorge, you are fine.

21:05.230 --> 21:08.015
And you are also the ghost.

21:08.050 --> 21:10.809
Everything that happened
was just you sleepwalking.

21:10.844 --> 21:14.522
Oh, that makes sense.

21:14.557 --> 21:17.099
That Olga ghost story
really scared me,

21:17.135 --> 21:18.842
and I sleepwalk when I'm scared.

21:18.877 --> 21:22.454
But why were you also sleep-stealing
our blankets and candy?

21:22.490 --> 21:25.199
Obviously, after hearing
the ghost story,

21:25.201 --> 21:27.459
he was stealing things
that Olga would have wanted.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.503
She was cold and loved candy.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.865
I feel I should point out, Jorge
also steals candy when he's awake.

21:35.645 --> 21:37.545
I can't believe I wore this
hideous dress for nothing.

21:37.580 --> 21:41.040
Hmph, not for nothing.
You look ridiculous! (LAUGHS)

21:42.551 --> 21:44.218
Actually, she looks gorgeous.

21:44.253 --> 21:45.493
I know. (STOMPS FOOT)

21:47.856 --> 21:50.324
By the way, Emma,
if I die first,

21:50.359 --> 21:51.901
I'm gonna haunt
the heck out of you!

21:51.936 --> 21:55.220
Just think, in 100 years, some poor
campers will be throwing Hazel a wedding.

22:00.761 --> 22:03.195
There's just one thing
I still don't get.

22:03.230 --> 22:11.230
Jorge, why did you write the word "angry"
in jam on the canoe in the mess hall?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.631
I didn't. I must've written But you still
forgot the letter "u" in "hungry."

22:14.667 --> 22:16.374
I'm also a really bad speller.

22:16.410 --> 22:20.579
Plus, I was asleep, and writing in jam.
Get off my back!

22:22.683 --> 22:24.363
(FOOTSTEPS) (ALL SCREAM)

22:25.837 --> 22:27.469
Who is that?

22:27.505 --> 22:28.937
It's a ghost!

22:28.973 --> 22:30.631
Not yet, no thanks to you guys.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.668
It's me, Timmy!

22:34.703 --> 22:36.203
I got the check from my parents!

22:36.238 --> 22:37.462
I can finally come to camp!

22:37.497 --> 22:40.240
Great.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.676
Aww, this check is made out
to "Camp Kikiwoka",

22:42.711 --> 22:44.144
so back to the front gate.

22:49.351 --> 22:50.351
Wait! Timmy...

22:52.163 --> 22:53.403
That blanket is camp property.

22:56.491 --> 23:02.963
Now that is just cold.
