02:10.187 --> 02:11.166
Keep it moving.

02:17.862 --> 02:20.365
All right. I put two bottles of HEET in
and pulled your battery cable.

02:20.465 --> 02:22.934
The engine light should stay off long
enough for you to pass the smog check,

02:23.034 --> 02:24.836
- but you gotta go, like, right now.
- Yo! Hurry it up!

02:24.936 --> 02:26.371
That's gonna be 15 for the HEET,
10 for the labor.

02:26.471 --> 02:27.472
Un minuto, huh?

02:27.572 --> 02:29.774
And drive slow, all right?
Like abuela slow.

02:29.874 --> 02:31.478
Hey! I got places to go. Let's go!

02:31.743 --> 02:33.086
Can I open now?

02:33.211 --> 02:35.247
Yo! Let's go! Hurry it up!

02:35.347 --> 02:36.849
Hey, un minuto!

02:37.115 --> 02:39.484
Chill out, man, I'm working here!
You'll get out in a bit.

02:39.584 --> 02:41.553
You never even talk to him.

02:41.653 --> 02:43.321
Don't worry about it. Come here.

02:43.421 --> 02:45.398
Hey, I don't wanna make you late
for your costume party.

02:53.398 --> 02:54.666
Hey, how much you got for me today?

02:54.766 --> 02:58.213
Hey, Hector, you know,
if I had a penny I'd give it to you.

03:00.438 --> 03:02.714
Better have something tomorrow.

03:08.580 --> 03:09.854
You okay?

03:11.649 --> 03:13.856
It's just, the floor's slippery.

03:14.419 --> 03:16.021
Whatever, it's fine.

03:16.121 --> 03:17.429
It's fine.

03:19.958 --> 03:20.936
Careful.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.936
The U.S. Armed Forces and NASA
are the proud sponsors

03:32.036 --> 03:35.206
of the Fifth Annual
Underwater Robotics Competition.

03:35.306 --> 03:39.477
This prestigious contest to be held this year
in Santa Barbara, California

03:39.577 --> 03:41.784
highlights student innovation
in technology.

03:42.914 --> 03:45.485
- Participants could get scouted...
- Oscar Vazquez?

03:47.719 --> 03:52.065
Here I have my application
and all of my JROTC certificates.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.426
I made my way up to Staff Sergeant.

03:54.526 --> 03:58.963
Sir, I was told with my service
I could enlist E3, Private First Class?

03:59.063 --> 04:00.632
An advanced ranking
shouldn't be a problem.

04:00.732 --> 04:03.802
Just give me your birth certificate
and I'll start a file on you.

04:03.902 --> 04:06.007
Sir, I have a friend in Iraq.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.207
And he tells me that it's so hard
to recruit right now...

04:09.340 --> 04:13.914
He says that sometimes
it's okay if a paper or two are missing.

04:15.513 --> 04:16.786
Your friend is mistaken.

04:24.489 --> 04:27.792
Look, if you find your birth certificate,
please come back.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.530
You'd make a great recruit.

04:29.961 --> 04:32.498
If not, if it's permanently unavailable,

04:33.231 --> 04:35.711
don't go presenting yourself
to any government office.

04:36.468 --> 04:37.970
For your own well-being.

04:38.102 --> 04:41.743
You've heard of immigration
Customs Enforcement, right, son?

04:42.540 --> 04:45.248
ICE. Yes, sir.

04:52.317 --> 04:53.318
Storm.

05:04.395 --> 05:06.500
Dad finds out you've been stealing,
he'll kill you.

05:06.865 --> 05:08.811
- It was just, like, once.
- What was once?

05:11.269 --> 05:14.182
I was just saying, I got a new job.

05:14.305 --> 05:15.648
It's nothing regular though.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.394
- You skim?
- No, that's all of it.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.931
You're getting really good at this.

05:39.697 --> 05:41.040
People are gonna think
you're my daughter.

06:17.769 --> 06:18.870
They're gonna have to double-check.

06:18.970 --> 06:22.645
So, it may take a little bit longer
to process the papers.

06:27.946 --> 06:29.084
Oscar.

07:25.169 --> 07:26.137
Karen, please. Just one minute.

07:26.237 --> 07:29.480
I am so sorry. I apologize.

07:30.274 --> 07:32.345
Fire Marshal. Don't ask.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.314
So...

07:35.013 --> 07:38.416
No formal teaching experience.

07:38.516 --> 07:40.818
No. But I did train people sometimes.

07:40.918 --> 07:44.491
And new engineers aren't always
the most adjusted people.

07:46.290 --> 07:48.927
And the training that you did,
this was at Aerotech,

07:49.027 --> 07:51.963
or you were at NextCorp for four months,

07:52.063 --> 07:54.566
or the three months at InterCon?

07:54.899 --> 07:58.176
You probably guess
what my follow-up question is gonna be.

07:58.569 --> 08:00.571
Where do I get my stamina?

08:03.541 --> 08:07.990
In the engineering world, it's quite common
to jump from project to project.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.380
Really?

08:09.480 --> 08:14.020
Because prior to all that you worked
at the same firm for 15 years.

08:14.419 --> 08:18.731
What, all of a sudden, makes Mr. Stability,
with a Ph.D., by the way,

08:19.090 --> 08:21.661
careen, you know,
from job to job to job?

08:21.893 --> 08:24.862
Do you always grill
potential substitutes like this?

08:24.962 --> 08:30.139
Look, Mrs. Lawson is on maternity leave
for another four months.

08:30.735 --> 08:34.615
If you last that long, it'll be longer
than most of my permanent hires.

08:34.739 --> 08:36.684
Then you can't be choosy, can you?

08:38.076 --> 08:40.249
I don't have to make you pee
in a cup, do I?

08:40.378 --> 08:44.258
No. Unless that's how
you get your kicks.

08:44.882 --> 08:48.489
So, why teaching? I mean, why now?

08:49.020 --> 08:51.956
You know, I've always wanted
to give back.

08:52.056 --> 08:56.402
You know, mold young minds,
do good in an under-served community.

08:58.996 --> 09:01.833
It's almost impossible
to estimate how many of our students

09:01.933 --> 09:03.401
go on to higher education.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.970
Probably a third
claim they're going to college.

09:06.070 --> 09:08.640
But most of them drop out
after a semester or two.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.008
I mean, it's not easy.

09:10.108 --> 09:11.442
Half of them are undocumented.

09:11.542 --> 09:16.748
And then, every once in a while,
one of their classmates disappears

09:16.848 --> 09:19.192
and is deported to Mexico the next day.

09:23.454 --> 09:26.958
Well, tell them Principal Lowry
would like to see them try.

09:27.759 --> 09:29.594
It's a crazy system.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.139
Stop it. Now.

09:32.063 --> 09:36.234
And you're gonna wanna start drinking tea
'cause your throat will get sore.

09:36.334 --> 09:38.169
Even if you're not a yeller.
It happened to me.

09:38.269 --> 09:39.237
- Karen!
- Yeah.

09:39.337 --> 09:41.372
The computers in the library are fried.

09:41.472 --> 09:45.076
We are down to three machines now
for 2,000 students.

09:45.176 --> 09:49.313
Okay. So, 1,997 of them will have
to play videogames somewhere else.

09:49.413 --> 09:52.587
This is Gwen Kolinsky. She... Hold up.

09:54.285 --> 09:56.765
Wait. It was in the meatloaf?

09:58.856 --> 10:00.301
What do you think was in the meatloaf?

10:01.259 --> 10:02.393
Who are you again?

10:02.493 --> 10:04.729
I'm Fredi Cameron.
I'm the new science sub.

10:04.829 --> 10:07.832
Thank God.
Last one was a global warming denier.

10:07.932 --> 10:09.536
That's crazy.

10:10.001 --> 10:12.379
Now, the moon landing.
Now that, I just don't see it.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.775
That's a nice suit
for a substitute teacher.

10:17.875 --> 10:18.876
Is it too much?

10:18.976 --> 10:22.549
I didn't know about the dress code
and I never really taught before.

10:23.281 --> 10:24.949
Private sector guy.

10:25.049 --> 10:26.824
Is that a bad thing?

10:28.786 --> 10:29.764
Excuse me.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.145
God.

10:51.008 --> 10:52.510
What, your car overheat?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.817
The temperature safety sensor.

10:55.213 --> 10:58.490
Well, here goes a couple hundred bucks.
That's nice.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.651
Can I have the number
for a local towing company?

11:00.751 --> 11:02.120
Hey, look man,
you don't gotta scrap the whole thing.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.290
You just gotta override it.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.628
What'd you say your name was?

11:07.024 --> 11:09.660
Lorenzo Santillan.
I'll do it for 20 bucks.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.395
How about you let me
borrow your tools for 10?

11:11.495 --> 11:13.765
Man, if you don't like my prices,
go see what it costs you for the tow.

11:13.865 --> 11:15.139
Fine. 20.

11:18.402 --> 11:20.814
Hey, this ain't a social call.
I get paid in advance.

11:25.209 --> 11:26.187
All right.

11:28.913 --> 11:30.782
You went to all the trouble
of reversing my sensor wires

11:30.882 --> 11:32.953
and all you're taking
for it is 20 bucks?

11:38.589 --> 11:40.591
This is Theresa Cruz
from Cruz and Associates.

11:40.691 --> 11:42.994
I just wanted to let you know
that our positions are currently filled,

11:43.094 --> 11:45.029
but go ahead
and check back in three months.

11:45.129 --> 11:47.439
We may have another opening.
Thanks so much.

11:48.966 --> 11:50.568
Hi, this is a message for Fredi Cameron.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.937
This is Bob Board returning your call.

11:53.037 --> 11:55.873
Unfortunately, we do not have
any openings right now.

11:55.973 --> 11:58.009
But if you'll check back with us
in about three months,

11:58.109 --> 11:59.884
maybe something will appear then.
Thank you.

12:01.979 --> 12:04.152
Newton's first law of motion.

12:05.483 --> 12:08.396
A body at rest will stay at rest.

12:09.587 --> 12:13.558
A concept, in the last 45 minutes,
you seem to understand very well.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.172
Really, nobody's gonna crack open
a book, nothing?

12:18.296 --> 12:19.468
They're in there.

12:25.236 --> 12:26.237
Why do they lock this?

12:26.370 --> 12:27.474
So we don't steal 'em.

12:27.905 --> 12:28.883
Great.

12:30.841 --> 12:34.679
A reminder that academic clubs
begin today after school.

12:34.779 --> 12:35.913
To see which ones count

12:36.013 --> 12:38.416
toward mandated community service,

12:38.516 --> 12:40.962
please consult the list
outside the main office.

12:44.588 --> 12:46.290
Versatility is crucial.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.727
This ROV from last year
utilized multiple hinges on its gripper

12:49.827 --> 12:51.329
for greater range of motion.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.385
Hey...

13:04.742 --> 13:06.312
Oh, man, really?

13:06.944 --> 13:07.912
Sorry I'm late, sir.

13:08.012 --> 13:10.253
- I had to wait for a computer.
- Are you for the club?

13:11.449 --> 13:12.427
The Engineering Club?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.794
Yeah, you're Dr. Cameron, right?

13:14.919 --> 13:17.399
When Ms. Lowry told me
that I had to oversee a club,

13:17.722 --> 13:20.703
she also assured me
that no one would show up.

13:20.925 --> 13:24.161
With all due respect, sir,
is this club on or not?

13:24.261 --> 13:28.732
Because I just spent an hour researching
this competition that I would like to enter.

13:36.440 --> 13:41.583
Okay, you see, in order
to enter this competition,

13:42.279 --> 13:46.250
we would have to build a remotely-operated
vehicle that swims underwater.

13:46.350 --> 13:50.127
I mean, you know
this is the desert, right?

13:51.422 --> 13:53.629
- Permission to speak freely, sir?
- Sure.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.960
There's an ROV up on Mars.

13:56.193 --> 13:58.901
I'm pretty sure
it wasn't built up on Mars. Sir.

13:59.597 --> 14:01.132
Okay.

14:01.232 --> 14:03.834
Well, this is a highly
advanced piece of machinery.

14:03.934 --> 14:07.074
And as you can see,
last year's winner was MIT.

14:07.538 --> 14:11.350
So, you wanna go up against
the best tech school in the country

14:11.876 --> 14:13.878
- in an engineering contest?
- No, no. Sir, sir.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.013
There is a separate division
for high schools.

14:16.113 --> 14:17.786
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

14:18.349 --> 14:20.418
- Oscar Vazquez.
- Okay, Oscar.

14:20.518 --> 14:23.554
It's not that I'm not into
playing the whole Don Quixote thing.

14:23.654 --> 14:27.261
It's just... I'm not gonna
be here that long.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.406
The competition's in three months.

14:31.595 --> 14:33.199
You're here for four, right?

14:35.633 --> 14:38.637
It says they scout
for internships and jobs.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.712
But it's getting harder for kids like me
to get anywhere near that stuff.

14:47.611 --> 14:49.215
You know what, Oscar?

14:51.315 --> 14:54.319
Find a couple more kids and it's on.

14:56.087 --> 14:59.023
A reminder.
Those assigned to Anger Management

14:59.123 --> 15:02.468
must report fifth hour, room L-345

15:02.793 --> 15:04.895
for the especially angry.

15:04.995 --> 15:08.332
You're not recruiting
on school grounds, are you,

15:08.432 --> 15:10.343
Private Vazquez?

15:11.268 --> 15:12.303
No, ma'am.

15:15.139 --> 15:16.914
There's no "private."

15:19.243 --> 15:21.348
Things just didn't work out.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.681
Don't worry about me.

15:24.115 --> 15:27.790
I got this going on
with the new sub, Dr. Cameron.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.996
This looks really great.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.537
I'm not so sure
how long he plans on staying around.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.503
I think I'll take my chances.

15:39.463 --> 15:40.965
That's what I like about you.

15:41.265 --> 15:42.505
I'm leaving you guys this.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.406
Y'all gotta check it out, okay?

15:45.402 --> 15:47.245
- Have you talked to Cristian yet?
- Hey, here's a...

15:48.572 --> 15:49.744
Who's Cristian?

16:01.652 --> 16:04.688
No! I almost cracked
Bertrand's postulate.

16:04.788 --> 16:05.892
Do you know how many steps that is?

16:06.023 --> 16:09.835
Doing you a favor. You really want
people seeing you do math for fun?

16:17.101 --> 16:21.072
Hey, you want me to program
the cheat codes so you can't die?

16:21.505 --> 16:22.813
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

16:35.653 --> 16:37.223
Cristian, you little...

16:38.722 --> 16:39.700
Hey!

16:45.296 --> 16:46.697
Hey, you seen that little twit Cristian?

16:46.797 --> 16:48.799
He's got, like, a striped shirt?

17:18.028 --> 17:19.564
It's all to scale.

17:20.396 --> 17:24.435
I... And for materials,
I was thinking syntactic flotation foam?

17:24.535 --> 17:28.073
I sourced a grade
that's stable up to 1,000 meters.

17:31.709 --> 17:33.086
Did you do this by yourself?

17:33.277 --> 17:37.214
Well, I used a picture
from the flyer that I saw.

17:37.314 --> 17:39.988
I just corrected its design flaws.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.388
It's elegant.

17:44.455 --> 17:47.561
Great. Okay.
So, we can start building, right?

17:47.958 --> 17:48.926
Yeah, well, hang on, guys.

17:49.026 --> 17:53.364
The first rule of engineering is
you never build anything with real material

17:53.464 --> 17:55.375
until you build
a proof-of-concept model.

17:58.736 --> 18:00.147
We can use hangers for the frame.

18:00.704 --> 18:01.876
Styrofoam for ballast?

18:05.309 --> 18:06.879
Toggle switches.

18:13.851 --> 18:15.452
Your mission,
if you choose to accept it,

18:15.552 --> 18:18.795
is to explore a sunken World War II
submarine and the surrounding area.

18:19.456 --> 18:21.292
Using your on board cameras
for guidance,

18:21.392 --> 18:23.160
you must navigate
through an eight-part course

18:23.260 --> 18:25.467
that will test your ROV's agility
and efficiency.

18:26.930 --> 18:29.600
Your ROV should be prepared
to measure the length,

18:29.700 --> 18:32.369
width and temperature
of designated objects,

18:32.469 --> 18:35.172
diffuse any potential threats
from artillery or biochemical warfare...

18:35.272 --> 18:37.841
Did you get to the part
where you have to retrieve a liquid

18:37.941 --> 18:41.980
from some kind of drum
without getting any pool water in it?

18:43.514 --> 18:45.983
Well, now that you've ruined the ending.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.257
You know, Oscar Vazquez thinks you're
really going to see this thing through.

18:49.386 --> 18:51.229
You say that like he's wrong.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.791
He already ran into one brick wall.

18:53.891 --> 18:56.360
I don't want him running
face first into another.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.629
You want me to shut this down
so I don't disappoint him.

18:58.729 --> 19:00.538
- Is that what you came to say?
- No.

19:00.664 --> 19:02.733
I came to ask if you know PBASIC,

19:02.833 --> 19:05.736
because you're going to need it
to program your robot.

19:05.836 --> 19:07.611
Is that different than basic BASIC?

19:11.208 --> 19:12.414
It's been a while.

19:13.844 --> 19:15.118
Come by Wednesday night.

19:15.946 --> 19:20.190
Not to brag or anything,
but I'm kind of a coding savant.

19:21.151 --> 19:23.131
That's great. Thanks.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.228
What time do you want me there?

19:27.358 --> 19:28.530
7:00 it is.

19:38.202 --> 19:40.239
The paint's chipped,
but they still work.

19:40.671 --> 19:42.072
I just need the motors inside.

19:42.172 --> 19:44.345
These are great. Thank you.

19:46.610 --> 19:50.922
I can help with clothes, too,
if you want to fix all of that.

19:52.449 --> 19:53.587
What's wrong with this?

19:54.218 --> 19:55.322
Everything.

19:55.786 --> 19:57.388
If you're not gonna wear
a uniform anymore,

19:57.488 --> 19:59.156
you gotta figure out
what kind of guy you are.

19:59.256 --> 20:01.167
Are you a preppy guy?

20:01.325 --> 20:02.926
Not a grungy guy.

20:03.026 --> 20:06.166
Wait a minute.
How do you know what I wear?

20:06.463 --> 20:08.340
I've decided you're a good guy.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.811
Take your shirt off.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.313
Right here?

20:13.103 --> 20:14.173
Yeah.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.401
No, no, no.

20:34.558 --> 20:36.469
You can't. Don't tuck it in.

20:42.099 --> 20:44.268
All right. You got 11 weeks.

20:44.368 --> 20:48.646
Okay, so I drew up weekly targets.
Four weeks for R&D and two for...

20:52.943 --> 20:53.921
You okay?

20:58.282 --> 21:00.262
I didn't close the circuit, did I?

21:00.484 --> 21:02.225
I'd put money on no.

21:02.586 --> 21:04.327
I thought you were a genius.

21:05.889 --> 21:09.393
I'm more of a theory guy.
I don't really make anything.

21:10.260 --> 21:11.830
Are you allowed to build for us, sir?

21:12.129 --> 21:15.466
If you think you have a chance to make it
to the competition in California, no.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.137
'Cause you guys would be disqualified.

21:19.536 --> 21:22.142
Then you're gonna have to
help us find someone who can.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.943
You need a better angle.

21:25.542 --> 21:26.612
Here.

21:29.046 --> 21:31.982
You see the control I got?
That's all geometry.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.885
I mean, that's all stuff
that you can learn in the Robotics Club.

21:34.985 --> 21:36.828
Nerd club? No gracias.

21:45.362 --> 21:47.968
Hey, they really need someone like you.

21:48.365 --> 21:49.867
It's not my problem.

21:50.200 --> 21:53.181
You know whose car this is? Yeah?

21:53.737 --> 21:58.482
Well, let's see what Ms. Lowry thinks
about you casing her Lucinda Williams CDs.

22:00.544 --> 22:01.522
Hey.

22:03.013 --> 22:06.017
Santillan, I have missed you.

22:06.149 --> 22:08.051
How long has it been? Two weeks?

22:08.151 --> 22:09.987
Come on in. Come on.

22:10.087 --> 22:12.397
No, not you. Just him. Thank you.

22:12.523 --> 22:14.366
So, Lorenzo...

22:15.325 --> 22:18.704
What do you know about Tuscany?

22:21.265 --> 22:22.866
Nothing. I know, me neither.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.636
I don't know anything about it.
But I intend to.

22:25.736 --> 22:27.704
Because, by the end of the school year,

22:27.804 --> 22:30.808
I'm gonna have enough miles
to get myself a free ticket,

22:30.908 --> 22:35.220
and I plan on eat, pray,
loving my way through the place.

22:36.046 --> 22:38.682
You're looking at me like,
why is she telling me this?

22:38.782 --> 22:40.617
It's because it means

22:40.717 --> 22:43.821
absolutely nothing can happen to my car,

22:43.921 --> 22:45.696
that's gonna cost me any money.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.291
Look, like I was telling him.

22:47.391 --> 22:49.126
Him? You mean, Dr. Cameron?

22:49.226 --> 22:52.969
Because I would strongly suggest
that you be respectful to him.

22:53.096 --> 22:55.966
- Okay, so Dr. Cameron was the...
- Because in case you don't realize it,

22:56.066 --> 23:00.105
he is the one who stands between you

23:00.537 --> 23:03.609
and a jail cell in the country
of his choosing.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.959
Anytime, kid.

23:15.252 --> 23:17.630
I apologize for, like, what I did.

23:18.088 --> 23:19.066
And...

23:23.360 --> 23:26.637
And I'll do anything you say
to make it right.

23:28.865 --> 23:32.176
I know this is wrong,
but this is my favorite part of the job.

23:34.071 --> 23:35.049
Bye.

23:38.008 --> 23:40.386
Lorenzo, right?

23:42.079 --> 23:43.956
These are snap-action switches.

23:45.616 --> 23:48.118
It's what regulates
a refrigerator light.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.720
My fridge light doesn't do anything.

23:49.820 --> 23:50.890
What's he doing here?

23:51.421 --> 23:52.923
This is our new mechanic, Lorenzo.

23:53.023 --> 23:55.833
No. Not gonna happen.
Cannot have him on the team, sir.

23:55.959 --> 23:57.661
All right, cool. See you guys.

23:57.761 --> 24:00.503
Hey, come on. Sit down. All right?

24:05.302 --> 24:08.681
You don't know this kid, sir.
He's a weak link.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.515
Well, actually, I do kinda know the kid.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.244
He's your linchpin.

24:13.744 --> 24:16.247
Which means we're not gonna
have any attitude, right, linchpin?

24:18.415 --> 24:21.419
Lorenzo, there are four motors.

24:22.819 --> 24:26.857
The two on the bottom control forward
and backward and also left and right.

24:26.957 --> 24:28.664
These two on top...

24:30.293 --> 24:32.068
Control up and down.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.723
Can I go now?

24:49.946 --> 24:51.357
You can if it works.

24:51.748 --> 24:53.489
Front, back,

24:53.984 --> 24:55.520
left, right.

24:56.086 --> 24:58.589
If you want up down,
you've gotta get another switch.

24:58.689 --> 25:01.692
If you wanna control speed,
I'd spring for a joystick,

25:01.792 --> 25:04.136
you know, and all the stuff
that comes with it.

25:11.234 --> 25:14.147
Lorenzo, this is really great work.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.618
Whatever.

25:17.941 --> 25:20.512
I guess if we can get him
to perform like this regularly...

25:22.546 --> 25:23.513
I'm sitting right here.

25:23.613 --> 25:25.182
Did you want to be
part of the planning process?

25:25.282 --> 25:27.150
Do you really want
to help us work out our timeline?

25:27.250 --> 25:29.457
Okay, great team spirit. Okay.

25:29.953 --> 25:31.660
You know, when we're done
with the timeline,

25:32.155 --> 25:33.964
you guys ought to think
about some personnel

25:34.124 --> 25:37.127
to lift the full-size ROV out of the water,
and it's not gonna be light.

25:37.227 --> 25:38.662
Usually, it takes two guys.

25:38.762 --> 25:42.209
And I'd love to help you,
but we'd all be disqualified.

25:44.735 --> 25:46.737
Did you pay for this with my money?

25:46.837 --> 25:47.975
It's free, Hector.

25:50.540 --> 25:53.477
So you don't mind
if I just play with it like that?

25:53.577 --> 25:56.080
Hey! He ask you to do that?

25:57.748 --> 25:59.316
We're just playing, Luis.

25:59.416 --> 26:01.418
We're just playing, right?

26:01.518 --> 26:03.293
But we're done for now, huh?

26:21.271 --> 26:23.581
What are you doing after school?

26:24.474 --> 26:27.944
Take a good look at this
'cause everything that's on here

26:28.044 --> 26:30.414
is something
that you guys don't have money for.

26:30.514 --> 26:33.316
- What's MIT?
- Massachusetts institute of Technology.

26:33.416 --> 26:34.851
A school full of hims.

26:34.951 --> 26:37.397
Yeah, but you're not up against them.

26:37.554 --> 26:40.524
You're up against all the kids
who will go there eventually.

26:40.624 --> 26:43.393
Probably have access
to more money than you do, so, yeah.

26:43.493 --> 26:45.796
You guys got some ground
to make up, okay?

26:45.896 --> 26:49.933
If I were you, I would start
by hitting up the local businesses first.

26:50.033 --> 26:52.035
Okay, wait. Real quick.

26:52.135 --> 26:54.838
How much can we put you down for, sir?

26:54.938 --> 26:57.607
I'd really love to help,
but advisors aren't allowed to donate.

26:57.707 --> 26:58.675
Big disqualifications.

26:58.775 --> 27:00.444
But I'm sure you guys
will have good luck out there.

27:00.544 --> 27:03.423
No, I'll fix stuff, but I'm not gonna
be that poor kid begging.

27:04.548 --> 27:06.249
All right, look, I get it.
Okay, my last job,

27:06.349 --> 27:08.752
I had to beg rich guys for money
all the time, and you're right.

27:08.852 --> 27:12.856
It does suck, and it makes you feel
all low and pathetic, but you gotta do it.

27:12.956 --> 27:15.625
You gotta put yourself out there
or you're never gonna get the grant,

27:15.725 --> 27:17.534
you're never gonna get the job...

27:18.762 --> 27:21.064
And you're never gonna get the girl.

27:21.164 --> 27:22.370
Like that one?

27:22.499 --> 27:24.167
Really, is that all you guys
think about?

27:24.267 --> 27:26.804
In other words,
she's out of your league.

27:28.138 --> 27:30.345
Yeah, she's out of everyone's league,
thank you.

27:31.007 --> 27:31.975
You should go talk to her.

27:32.075 --> 27:33.877
You guys want me
to go over there and ask her out?

27:33.977 --> 27:36.150
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Go!

27:37.147 --> 27:38.524
Are we looking at a teachable moment?

27:38.648 --> 27:39.716
Sure.

27:39.816 --> 27:41.386
You're so inspiring.

27:42.352 --> 27:43.387
All right.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.523
But remember,
this is gonna be harder than anything

27:46.623 --> 27:47.891
you guys are gonna ask for today.

27:47.991 --> 27:49.698
- Yeah, we'll keep that in mind.
- Okay.

27:50.694 --> 27:52.002
Hey, Gwen.

27:52.662 --> 27:53.640
Yeah.

27:53.964 --> 27:58.106
I need you to slap me. Hard.
Like I said something offensive to you.

28:01.304 --> 28:02.544
Okay.

28:02.706 --> 28:04.975
Who is gonna look bad here though,
you or me?

28:05.075 --> 28:06.611
Oh, no. Definitely me.

28:07.143 --> 28:11.248
Okay. Well... Just...
I can't just slap you out of nowhere.

28:11.348 --> 28:13.049
- Just say something to me.
- Okay, you mean...

28:13.149 --> 28:14.951
- Get a little more motivation.
- You need to get in character?

28:15.051 --> 28:16.520
Yes, you got it.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.099
I think women are all horrible teachers.

28:18.421 --> 28:20.190
- Not bad. Keep going.
- Okay.

28:20.290 --> 28:22.031
All school funding should be slashed.

28:22.192 --> 28:24.628
All the heroes in the school system
are really the politicians.

28:24.728 --> 28:25.996
They deserve all the credit.

28:26.096 --> 28:27.230
And girls doing math?

28:27.330 --> 28:28.365
I mean, really?

28:34.504 --> 28:35.772
Was that good?

28:35.872 --> 28:38.809
- Did you like that?
- Yes, I liked it. Thank you. I liked it.

28:38.909 --> 28:39.887
Sorry.

28:45.282 --> 28:47.922
All right. You see? Somehow I survived.

28:51.087 --> 28:52.566
How much do we need?

28:53.156 --> 28:55.592
I'm raising money for my Robotics Club.

28:55.692 --> 29:00.130
Every cent of your donation would go
towards robotics parts and travel expenses.

29:00.230 --> 29:02.141
I'm sorry, man. Can you read?

29:19.649 --> 29:21.351
Myself and my fellow soldiers
really appreciate it.

29:21.451 --> 29:22.896
It's the least we can do.

29:23.420 --> 29:24.621
Thank you for your help, ma'am.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.758
No, thank you for your service.

29:43.773 --> 29:46.652
It's always a pleasure to support
the young people in our community.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.218
So, now let's see what we can...

29:49.446 --> 29:52.482
Gosh, you know, it looks like
we're kicked for this calendar year.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.027
Do you plan on entering next year?

29:54.150 --> 29:56.586
Ma'am, we're really focused
on this year.

29:56.686 --> 29:59.623
Okay. Well, I can give you
what we have left.

29:59.723 --> 30:01.703
But it's only about $100.

30:03.059 --> 30:04.595
I hope that's okay.

30:05.528 --> 30:06.666
Who should I make it out to?

30:06.796 --> 30:08.104
Carl Hayden Robotics.

30:10.166 --> 30:11.144
Here you go.

30:13.770 --> 30:14.942
Thank you very much.

30:40.663 --> 30:42.438
Hi, is your mom home?

30:43.133 --> 30:44.908
We have a coding lesson.

30:45.368 --> 30:47.279
That's not even a euphemism.

30:48.171 --> 30:50.310
It's okay, honey. You can let him in.

31:01.418 --> 31:02.953
Do you like cats?

31:03.053 --> 31:06.967
'Cause I see a little figure of a cat.

31:10.693 --> 31:13.640
That's a beautiful name, Maddy.

31:14.030 --> 31:15.338
My dad named me.

31:16.633 --> 31:17.611
Well.

31:18.268 --> 31:19.872
- You made it.
- Yeah.

31:22.705 --> 31:24.641
So you'd put an analog-like
function here?

31:24.741 --> 31:26.584
Now you're getting it.

31:26.776 --> 31:28.812
Maybe I'm not as dumb as I look.

31:28.912 --> 31:31.950
Or maybe you are.
I'm just that good a teacher.

31:32.649 --> 31:36.953
I don't think so because you missed
a bracket five lines up.

31:37.053 --> 31:39.363
I was just too nice to say anything.

31:43.059 --> 31:44.928
- I don't know what you mean.
- I got it!

31:45.028 --> 31:46.234
Good save.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.364
- No, that's not...
- It's Dad.

31:52.969 --> 31:54.312
Take your time.

31:55.305 --> 31:56.613
What's up?

31:58.108 --> 31:59.917
Hello... Again.

32:00.777 --> 32:02.620
She's not gonna date you, you know.

32:03.947 --> 32:05.648
This is a school thing.
I'm not trying to...

32:05.748 --> 32:07.350
She doesn't date anybody.

32:07.450 --> 32:08.551
I find that hard to believe.

32:08.651 --> 32:11.588
Maddy! Maddy, Maddy,
get your little butt in here, now.

32:11.688 --> 32:16.330
Three Maddys. I'm gonna pick this up
and I'll take it into the kitchen, Maddy.

32:20.497 --> 32:22.632
Why did you tell your father
this was a date?

32:22.732 --> 32:25.611
If he gets jealous enough,
he'll come back.

32:28.905 --> 32:32.045
I don't know
if you heard any of that back there.

32:34.177 --> 32:35.247
Yeah.

32:36.646 --> 32:41.026
You don't need to explain anything.
I mean, we all have our stuff.

32:42.318 --> 32:43.286
Yes?

32:43.386 --> 32:44.521
- What's your stuff?
- Me?

32:44.621 --> 32:46.862
Now that you've heard my stuff.

32:47.323 --> 32:50.133
I don't have stuff.
I mean, I meant everybody but me.

32:51.427 --> 32:55.131
So, hey, thanks for the coding lesson.
That was great.

32:55.231 --> 32:59.611
Yeah, I wanted to see how serious
you were about all this robotics stuff.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.511
Did I pass the test?

33:03.640 --> 33:06.644
You showed up. That's not nothing.

33:07.744 --> 33:10.224
All right, well,
have a good night, Gwen.

33:12.982 --> 33:15.758
You gonna be safe walking in
by yourself?

33:17.220 --> 33:19.325
You can keep your eye on me.

33:19.856 --> 33:21.096
Will do.

33:23.426 --> 33:25.829
You know, nobody forced you
to take me out or anything.

33:25.929 --> 33:28.531
You could've saved yourself seven bucks
if you weren't into it.

33:28.631 --> 33:31.339
I brought you here
'cause this place means a lot to me.

33:33.269 --> 33:34.304
It does.

33:34.871 --> 33:38.409
I was six and my mom hid me
and my cousin in the back of this van.

33:38.908 --> 33:42.321
I must have spent, like,
eight hours hunched in there.

33:43.046 --> 33:45.492
Just trying not to throw up or cry.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.557
And once we crossed the border,

33:50.286 --> 33:51.287
they got us all burgers.

33:51.754 --> 33:53.423
I was way too carsick to eat.

33:53.523 --> 33:54.695
I mean,

33:56.192 --> 33:57.728
way carsick.

33:59.395 --> 34:00.567
So, I fell asleep.

34:01.164 --> 34:04.577
When I woke up, I was starving.

34:05.935 --> 34:07.414
But my burger was gone.

34:08.204 --> 34:13.347
And all that was left
was just this little tiny wrapper.

34:14.643 --> 34:16.123
Wanna know what happened?

34:17.679 --> 34:19.047
- Somebody ate it.
- Yes.

34:19.148 --> 34:21.754
My stupid cousin ate it
while I was sleeping.

34:22.284 --> 34:23.661
No burger for me.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.797
My abuelita came over like that.

34:26.155 --> 34:30.501
I mean, no stupid cousin
or anything, but it's similar.

34:31.995 --> 34:32.996
So, even though

34:34.664 --> 34:37.474
it's never happened,
I kind of get what you're saying.

34:40.303 --> 34:41.610
Thank you.

34:42.705 --> 34:43.706
For what?

34:44.239 --> 34:47.312
For knowing
I'm the kind of girl who'd get that.

35:02.091 --> 35:04.694
Yo, big guy. Coach wants to see you.

35:04.794 --> 35:06.569
All right, yo, peace!

35:07.630 --> 35:09.371
See you later, bro.

35:24.681 --> 35:26.388
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey!

36:00.083 --> 36:02.018
Like beating little kids?
How do you like this?

36:02.118 --> 36:04.120
Pick on someone your own size!

36:28.378 --> 36:30.179
I've never carried around
this much money before.

36:30.279 --> 36:33.920
- I still can't believe you made $652.
- And 53 cents.

36:34.083 --> 36:36.686
Waterproof electric motors.
Aren't they spectacular?

36:36.786 --> 36:40.290
They're small, they're powerful,
they're $299.99.

36:40.857 --> 36:41.858
Times four?

36:41.958 --> 36:45.337
$1,199.96.

36:45.928 --> 36:47.130
I'll go get change for the bus.

36:47.230 --> 36:49.642
No! We're not giving up.

36:52.769 --> 36:55.271
Wait a minute.
What if we get a bunch of tiny motors

36:55.371 --> 36:57.214
and just hook 'em up together
and cluster them together?

36:59.809 --> 37:00.777
Okay, fine.

37:00.877 --> 37:02.812
What if we just get
one of these motors and...

37:02.912 --> 37:04.289
Trolling motors.

37:06.649 --> 37:10.324
They gotta be strong, right, to move boats.
And they're cheap as hell.

37:11.721 --> 37:14.998
We can buy four
and then we can hack off the poles.

37:16.659 --> 37:21.369
But they're a lot larger. I mean,
we'd need more metal to fill the frame.

37:21.798 --> 37:23.243
Who says they gotta be metal?

37:47.089 --> 37:49.225
Hey, this is great work, guys.

37:49.325 --> 37:51.236
And $20.

37:56.432 --> 37:59.777
Sir, you're still short $432.54.

38:01.537 --> 38:03.744
What if we got rid of these?

38:05.575 --> 38:09.245
Sorry, we can't do anything
without the fuse panels,

38:09.345 --> 38:12.918
or the micro-controllers, or the batteries,
or the laser tape measure.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.151
It'll run without
the laser tape measure.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.819
Dr. Cameron,
if we don't have the laser tape measure,

38:16.919 --> 38:18.287
- I don't think...
- We'll figure it out later.

38:18.387 --> 38:21.425
Can you remove the laser tape measure?
Thank you.

38:23.493 --> 38:26.770
You are still short $134.63.

38:29.131 --> 38:30.576
Can I borrow your pen?

38:32.602 --> 38:34.237
I thought you couldn't donate.

38:34.337 --> 38:37.284
It's a robotics contest,
not a fundraising contest.

38:38.341 --> 38:40.042
Besides, who's gonna know?

38:40.142 --> 38:43.146
Hey, and my man
ate a couple ice creams on the way in.

38:45.481 --> 38:46.653
Can I have an ice cream?

38:46.782 --> 38:48.955
Too late. I already wrote the check.

39:04.233 --> 39:05.610
It's for NASA.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.783
You got something here, Lorenzo.

39:15.645 --> 39:18.455
What's your story, Camerones?
Why are you here?

39:19.348 --> 39:20.793
The bus ride isn't long enough.

39:22.418 --> 39:25.121
No, but I mean, seriously,
what are you doing here?

39:25.221 --> 39:27.792
I mean, did you screw up
your real job or something?

39:29.692 --> 39:30.898
Or something.

39:39.535 --> 39:41.604
Well, can I ask you one more thing?

39:41.704 --> 39:43.012
All right.

39:44.173 --> 39:46.551
If we win this contest,
can we go to Hooters?

39:50.446 --> 39:52.892
If we win,
I'll get you a date with one of them.

39:54.850 --> 39:56.319
Mrs. Vazquez?

39:56.419 --> 39:57.489
Yes.

39:58.287 --> 40:01.791
Ms. Kolinsky.
I was Oscar's math teacher last year.

40:01.891 --> 40:03.893
Of course, how are you?

40:03.993 --> 40:06.929
He left this at home
and I know how strict they are.

40:07.029 --> 40:10.010
I just wanted to say I'm so sorry
about how all that worked out.

40:10.566 --> 40:11.874
What do you mean?

40:23.646 --> 40:24.716
Mama, what are you doing here?

40:32.922 --> 40:34.526
Excuse me, Oscar.

40:45.334 --> 40:46.836
With this man who speaks Spanish
like a 3 year old?

40:47.036 --> 40:48.208
SeÃ±ora Vazquez?

40:48.337 --> 40:49.839
This isn't just for play.

40:50.673 --> 40:53.279
A student who won last year
got a job at Teledyne.

40:53.676 --> 40:57.556
- And they got scouted by a lot of other jobs.
- They had papers.

40:58.614 --> 41:01.751
You think they're gonna let you work
or go to college

41:01.851 --> 41:04.229
if they won't even let you serve?

41:23.239 --> 41:26.015
Mama. Mama!

41:27.143 --> 41:28.213
Mama!

41:40.122 --> 41:41.791
Come on.

41:41.891 --> 41:44.560
No, it's a very attractive offer,

41:44.660 --> 41:47.096
and you know I would love
to work with you guys.

41:47.196 --> 41:49.472
It's just bad timing.

41:51.100 --> 41:54.971
Yeah, you know,
a substitute is temporary by definition,

41:55.071 --> 41:58.441
but, I'm gonna try to see it
all the way through here.

41:58.541 --> 42:02.878
The oral questioning part of the competition
is worth 30% of the final score.

42:02.978 --> 42:06.248
Each team member
will be interviewed separately to ensure

42:06.348 --> 42:10.296
that everyone knows
the structural and mechanical concepts.

42:13.656 --> 42:15.294
- What?
- Nothing.

42:16.792 --> 42:19.830
Here, why don't we
walk you through this?

42:20.663 --> 42:23.473
The first thing is ROV electronics.

42:23.733 --> 42:25.041
It's gotta stay on dry land.

42:25.301 --> 42:28.337
You know,
the micro-controllers, the fuse panel,

42:28.437 --> 42:30.139
the battery as a kind of command center.

42:30.239 --> 42:32.041
Just call it all a brain.

42:32.141 --> 42:33.876
Does that make sense?

42:33.976 --> 42:36.012
The brain. I got it.

42:36.112 --> 42:37.246
All right.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.782
Stick close. We'll take it slow.

42:39.882 --> 42:42.652
See, underwater video cameras
are a couple hundred bucks.

42:42.752 --> 42:46.889
But, we're taking standard ones
that we got for 19 bucks.

42:46.989 --> 42:49.425
Putting them inside PVC pipe

42:49.525 --> 42:51.360
and then topping them
with plumbing unions.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.905
Smells like Luis' armpit.

42:55.064 --> 42:56.372
This glue stinks!

42:59.835 --> 43:01.570
We know we have to pick things up.

43:01.670 --> 43:03.305
Some teams will have mechanical claws.

43:03.405 --> 43:04.713
We'll have this.

43:07.243 --> 43:09.314
Video said something
about retrieving a liquid.

43:09.612 --> 43:11.480
So we'll suck it up
with this copper tubing,

43:11.580 --> 43:15.995
fill up the balloon, and use the milk jug
to secure the balloon

43:16.519 --> 43:18.624
which you'll retrieve, Luis.

43:25.661 --> 43:28.164
That's where a laser
tape measure would go.

43:28.264 --> 43:29.665
If we had one.

43:29.765 --> 43:32.535
Well, any laser measurement
would have to be adjusted

43:32.635 --> 43:35.237
by the index of refraction of water,
which is 1.33.

43:35.337 --> 43:37.180
Although, right now
that seems a little moot.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.655
All right. We'll go analog.

43:44.180 --> 43:46.683
We'll hook this into the hull
and point a camera at it.

43:47.216 --> 43:49.162
No index refraction of anything.

43:52.254 --> 43:53.255
Good job, that's waterproof.

43:53.355 --> 43:54.490
You see that seal right there?

43:54.590 --> 43:55.728
We should name it.

44:01.397 --> 44:04.400
After you guys are done painting tonight,
make sure you get a good night's rest.

44:04.500 --> 44:06.275
Tomorrow you got a big day.

44:07.036 --> 44:08.606
What's tomorrow?

44:09.171 --> 44:10.775
Stinky's baptism.

44:34.830 --> 44:36.707
And then, there's that.

44:37.967 --> 44:39.844
He's full of surprises.

44:54.149 --> 44:56.220
Ma'am, let me get that for you.
Here, let me help.

44:56.886 --> 44:58.331
Thank you.

45:03.192 --> 45:05.227
I saw something like this
in a horror movie once.

45:05.327 --> 45:08.865
Hey, she'll get you there. I think.

45:09.265 --> 45:13.903
So, obviously any gas
in the tank, up for grabs.

45:14.003 --> 45:16.172
Anything you put in,
you won't be reimbursed.

45:16.272 --> 45:18.808
And I suggest you stick
to the speed limit

45:18.908 --> 45:21.354
with four undocumented kids in the back.

45:22.711 --> 45:25.157
I have no idea how you got these keys.

45:26.749 --> 45:28.319
Good luck, boys.

45:31.020 --> 45:32.988
How long did your uncle say
we could be here?

45:33.088 --> 45:35.357
An hour, two.

45:35.457 --> 45:37.334
As long as we don't disturb the guests.

45:40.229 --> 45:42.368
Hey, what's that down there?

45:42.998 --> 45:43.966
Where?

45:44.066 --> 45:45.511
Hey, look. Camerones, look.

45:47.970 --> 45:48.971
There.

45:49.204 --> 45:50.410
- Can that hurt Stinky?
- What?

45:56.312 --> 45:57.513
Camerones.

45:57.613 --> 45:59.217
Did you see... Did you guys...

46:00.916 --> 46:02.987
Okay, wait a minute,
does he not know how to swim?

46:08.757 --> 46:09.992
He's not dead.

46:10.092 --> 46:11.435
He's not dead.

46:29.211 --> 46:30.588
Can you take our picture?

46:38.354 --> 46:39.389
Is it even on?

46:41.657 --> 46:43.261
Luis, pull it up.

46:45.761 --> 46:48.030
How could the motors
not have enough power? They're huge.

46:48.130 --> 46:49.098
It's not the size.

46:49.198 --> 46:51.300
It's the efficiency
not reaching its full potential.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.636
The power's degrading
over the length of the tethers.

46:53.736 --> 46:55.137
- We could make the tethers shorter.
- Can't.

46:55.237 --> 46:57.573
We need the length
to maneuver around the course.

46:57.673 --> 46:59.708
All right, then we get better cable.
I mean, how much could it be?

46:59.808 --> 47:01.515
Cable is cable. Even I know that.

47:01.977 --> 47:03.545
Well, then why don't you
think of something then?

47:03.645 --> 47:05.614
- Why does it have to be on me?
- Don't turn on each other, okay?

47:05.714 --> 47:08.160
Don't turn on each other.
Nobody's expecting any miracles. Relax.

47:08.751 --> 47:09.991
So, what do we do?

47:10.419 --> 47:12.592
I suggest you continue
to study my notes.

47:17.760 --> 47:21.674
And the rest of us? We'll think.

47:40.149 --> 47:41.822
Stay here, mijo.

47:46.688 --> 47:48.634
Do you think I'm stupid?

47:49.358 --> 47:51.429
Everyone thinks I'm stupid.

47:52.461 --> 47:56.705
There's a world of difference
between quiet and slow.

47:57.800 --> 48:01.213
You'll show everyone
which one you are in time.

48:10.846 --> 48:12.689
Was that a yes or a no?

48:20.389 --> 48:22.767
Look, I'm telling you, it was me.

48:23.592 --> 48:26.095
You're a much better artist than that.

48:28.297 --> 48:29.898
Plus, the description that they have

48:29.998 --> 48:32.234
is of a kid who's much shorter, right?

48:32.334 --> 48:35.471
So, if we do find out
who's responsible for it,

48:35.571 --> 48:38.575
we will handle it internally.
Thank you for coming out.

48:39.775 --> 48:40.943
Nice try.

48:41.043 --> 48:43.345
You go tell that brother of yours,
he's mine after school.

48:43.445 --> 48:44.480
On the record or not.

48:44.813 --> 48:45.814
Go.

48:50.252 --> 48:51.322
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

48:51.820 --> 48:55.624
I would kill to get Lorenzo's father to
show up for a parent-teacher conference

48:55.724 --> 48:57.626
or at least not hang up on me.

48:57.726 --> 48:59.831
To tell him he has two sons.

49:01.497 --> 49:04.166
He makes Lorenzo take the rap
for the younger brother.

49:04.266 --> 49:06.335
Ramiro was born here and Lorenzo wasn't,

49:06.435 --> 49:08.704
so he figures, the one with the papers,

49:08.804 --> 49:10.305
he should keep his record clean.

49:10.405 --> 49:14.009
Where I grew up, the kid with the papers
always took care of the family.

49:14.109 --> 49:15.713
Hence my problem.

49:16.078 --> 49:17.379
You know,

49:17.479 --> 49:19.891
I hear Picasso started the same way,

49:20.349 --> 49:22.522
without the hacking cough.

49:29.491 --> 49:33.862
Hey, so there's a rumor going around
that you asked me out,

49:33.962 --> 49:36.065
and then I kicked you in the groin.

49:36.165 --> 49:38.400
- Okay, that's weird.
- Yeah.

49:38.500 --> 49:40.502
A knee is really more my style.

49:40.602 --> 49:42.271
Well, it's a better angle.

49:42.371 --> 49:44.442
Geometrically.

49:45.707 --> 49:46.675
So, what is this?

49:46.775 --> 49:48.477
Well, since the marching band
only got like, four people,

49:48.577 --> 49:50.488
I was thinking
of getting an accordion...

50:01.623 --> 50:02.591
No. No, no, no.

50:02.691 --> 50:05.561
We are not changing
the school anthem to a nacho corrida.

50:05.661 --> 50:07.029
- Narcocorrido.
- Narcocorrido.

50:07.129 --> 50:08.163
- Narcocorrido.
- I know.

50:08.263 --> 50:09.465
Sorry. Have a jellybean.

50:09.565 --> 50:11.633
- I have another idea.
- Okay. What is it?

50:11.733 --> 50:13.702
We can get a tambura. It'd be fun.

50:13.802 --> 50:15.611
Tambura, tuba, accordion,

50:16.505 --> 50:17.573
tololoche.

50:17.673 --> 50:18.743
You don't like tambura?

50:36.325 --> 50:37.759
Mom. Did you talk to Uncle Rigo?

50:37.859 --> 50:39.861
Is he gonna do the camping thing
with me next month?

50:50.806 --> 50:52.752
Can I stay here a little bit longer?
It's kind of cold outside.

51:25.407 --> 51:28.744
In the water. You wanna put the batteries
and the electrics and stuff in the water.

51:28.844 --> 51:30.979
No. In a waterproof case, okay?

51:31.079 --> 51:33.682
And the cables are gonna be short,
so we won't have a power issue.

51:33.782 --> 51:35.584
Think about how well
it's going to handle.

51:35.684 --> 51:37.452
And listen,
would you rather hold the camera

51:37.552 --> 51:39.554
with one thin wire or four thick ones?

51:40.389 --> 51:43.192
Well, good handling's not gonna matter
if we flood the battery.

51:43.292 --> 51:45.661
I mean, one leak
and the whole thing's dead.

51:45.761 --> 51:48.298
Guys. If we can't make
something waterproof,

51:49.431 --> 51:51.809
then what are we doing
in an underwater contest?

52:01.877 --> 52:03.145
So, that's gonna keep the brain dry?

52:03.245 --> 52:04.246
Freaking better.

52:04.346 --> 52:06.915
We've got what,
three days before the contest?

52:07.015 --> 52:08.417
Two and a half, but who's counting?

52:08.517 --> 52:10.224
All right. Who's gonna do it?

52:10.952 --> 52:12.397
It's all you.

52:29.404 --> 52:30.712
We did it!

52:31.840 --> 52:33.217
Yes.

52:33.875 --> 52:36.745
Putting the brain on Stinky was genius.

52:36.845 --> 52:39.281
Our brain isn't in the water
in that new case,

52:39.381 --> 52:41.327
our brain is right here!

52:48.790 --> 52:51.426
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second, privately?

52:51.526 --> 52:52.494
Sure.

52:52.594 --> 52:55.234
All right, let's practice opening
and closing the claw.

52:56.131 --> 52:57.766
But, you gotta keep it there.

52:57.866 --> 52:59.334
Yeah, I know, but...

52:59.434 --> 53:00.469
What's up?

53:01.169 --> 53:02.944
This might be stupid.

53:03.538 --> 53:05.142
But, I just...

53:06.174 --> 53:09.155
There's this thing
I've been hearing about for, like, ever.

53:10.645 --> 53:11.988
What thing?

53:14.282 --> 53:15.852
It's like an outdoors thing

53:16.585 --> 53:17.853
for fathers and sons.

53:17.953 --> 53:20.355
They got these high-powered telescopes,

53:20.455 --> 53:22.457
so you can see all the constellations.

53:23.658 --> 53:25.035
Wow.

53:28.296 --> 53:30.606
I'm really flattered
that you thought of me.

53:32.634 --> 53:34.503
Let me,

53:34.603 --> 53:36.742
you know, check the schedule
and see if the...

53:37.606 --> 53:39.051
timing works out.

53:40.108 --> 53:43.021
I knew you wouldn't be able
to do it anyway.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.891
No, no, no. Hey.

53:48.817 --> 53:50.228
I'm thinking.

53:50.852 --> 53:53.924
It's not a big thing.
Dr. Cameron, I'm sorry.

53:58.226 --> 53:59.895
Right over there.

53:59.995 --> 54:01.030
Oscar.

54:02.697 --> 54:04.299
You got a minute?

54:04.399 --> 54:05.673
Give us a second.

54:07.969 --> 54:08.970
What's up?

54:10.105 --> 54:12.040
Immigration came
by the office this morning.

54:12.140 --> 54:13.983
Six files of interest were taken.

54:14.509 --> 54:17.149
Any chance
you gave us a phony home address?

54:17.712 --> 54:19.247
My mother's there right now.

54:19.347 --> 54:20.382
She's okay.

54:20.482 --> 54:22.217
They want you, not her.

54:22.317 --> 54:25.059
If I were you,
I'd crash at a friend's for a while.

54:28.089 --> 54:29.295
Thank you for the heads up, sir.

54:29.424 --> 54:32.132
Don't thank me for something
that never happened.

54:35.931 --> 54:37.999
I thought
you weren't leaving until Thursday.

54:38.099 --> 54:40.101
We found out if we get there early,

54:40.202 --> 54:42.604
there's a lot more practice time.

54:42.704 --> 54:44.445
It's gonna be great.

54:46.608 --> 54:48.744
More practice time

54:48.844 --> 54:51.757
and time to talk
to all those tech companies.

55:02.324 --> 55:03.359
Yes.

55:04.059 --> 55:05.231
What are you doing?

55:06.094 --> 55:08.370
I fixed the fridge light.

55:08.964 --> 55:10.944
Look. A micro-switch.

55:12.100 --> 55:13.602
The thing that does that.

55:13.702 --> 55:16.512
I'm learning about stuff
like this in Robotics Club.

55:16.972 --> 55:18.440
They teach you about electricity?

55:18.540 --> 55:20.409
Yeah, and all kinds of stuff like that.

55:20.509 --> 55:23.319
Yeah? They didn't teach you
it costs money?

55:29.651 --> 55:30.652
Where's your brother?

55:31.720 --> 55:32.821
I don't know.

55:32.921 --> 55:34.127
Are you gonna find out?

55:40.362 --> 55:42.898
Any of you guys seen Ramiro?
Seen my stupid brother?

55:42.998 --> 55:44.375
He just left.

55:45.934 --> 55:48.107
Him and Asher went
to get money at the Tri-H.

55:48.603 --> 55:50.105
There's no ATM at the Tri-H.

55:50.639 --> 55:52.084
There is now.

55:54.843 --> 55:56.413
Oh, man.

56:04.119 --> 56:05.187
You want the guy,

56:05.287 --> 56:07.656
or are you gonna pussy out
and go for the register?

56:07.756 --> 56:09.997
- I'll do the guy. I don't care.
- All right.

56:11.793 --> 56:12.931
Just to scare him.

56:20.602 --> 56:21.970
Yo! You're out of Funyuns!

56:22.070 --> 56:23.242
You got more in back?

56:23.371 --> 56:25.851
Ran out. We'll get more on Thursday.

56:26.775 --> 56:28.276
What do they got here? 30 bucks?

56:28.376 --> 56:29.945
- What are you, stupid?
- Bro, you're messing everything.

56:30.045 --> 56:31.346
- You got nothing to prove.
- You're a pussy, man.

56:31.446 --> 56:33.081
- Now, dude! Now!
- Hey, don't move, cabrÃ³n!

56:33.181 --> 56:34.159
Don't move.

56:41.523 --> 56:42.757
Go, go, go.

56:42.857 --> 56:43.858
I'm being robbed!

56:44.059 --> 56:46.728
What's wrong with you?
Why would you do something like this?

56:46.828 --> 56:48.563
- Get away from me!
- Why? Why did you do that?

56:48.663 --> 56:50.432
Okay, run away!

56:50.532 --> 56:51.943
Oh, man!

56:54.603 --> 56:55.673
Crap!

57:19.127 --> 57:20.231
Can I come in?

57:22.564 --> 57:24.733
You need to talk to him. Your father.

57:24.833 --> 57:26.001
No, look, he's gonna kill me, okay?

57:26.101 --> 57:29.471
Look, the only job I got for my whole life
is to protect my little brother, okay?

57:29.571 --> 57:30.777
And I messed that all up.

57:31.539 --> 57:33.375
If you think that babysitting
your brother

57:33.475 --> 57:35.610
is gonna be your life's work,

57:35.710 --> 57:37.145
it's not you that's messing it up.

57:37.245 --> 57:38.383
Could you tell him that?

57:38.913 --> 57:39.948
What?

57:40.048 --> 57:41.149
He doesn't listen to me.

57:41.249 --> 57:44.025
Maybe you can get him
to see that, you know.

57:48.123 --> 57:51.400
Lorenzo, it's really not my place

57:52.193 --> 57:54.529
to get in the middle
of your family business.

57:54.629 --> 57:55.903
Camerones.

57:56.331 --> 57:58.208
I can't face him alone right now.

58:11.446 --> 58:12.857
Can I come in?

58:14.382 --> 58:17.488
I'm gonna let you know right now,
seven is my limit.

58:17.986 --> 58:19.654
Okay. I'll try to keep it down.

58:19.754 --> 58:21.022
Yeah, that's a good pour.

58:21.122 --> 58:22.260
I'm gonna try to keep it down, too.

58:33.034 --> 58:34.877
Like I could breathe fire.

58:40.175 --> 58:42.678
This is good tequila.
Why are we drinking it?

58:47.482 --> 58:50.452
Ramiro might call you later from jail

58:50.552 --> 58:52.930
depending on whether they can get
any of his prints off the gun.

58:54.089 --> 58:55.432
No, you got the wrong house.

58:58.159 --> 58:59.763
You got the wrong kid.

58:59.961 --> 59:01.596
I'm not trying to get
into your business.

59:01.696 --> 59:03.031
I just think you need
to know what's happening.

59:03.131 --> 59:05.077
No. You don't know anything about us.

59:05.567 --> 59:07.342
Actually, I do.
I know your son very well.

59:07.736 --> 59:09.738
And I know that he wrestled
a gun away from his brother

59:09.838 --> 59:12.182
in a botched robbery
a couple of hours ago.

59:13.141 --> 59:14.415
Lorenzo was there?

59:16.711 --> 59:19.191
Lorenzo, get your ass out here now!

59:23.818 --> 59:26.855
Your brother got picked up?
What's wrong with you?

59:26.955 --> 59:28.590
What's wrong with you?

59:28.690 --> 59:30.759
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know if they got him. He ran...

59:30.859 --> 59:34.229
I sent you to go find him
and you don't protect him?

59:34.329 --> 59:35.808
Hey, don't talk to him like that!

59:36.364 --> 59:39.200
No, you don't tell me
how to talk to my son!

59:39.300 --> 59:41.569
Okay, look. I don't want to,
but if I have to, I will.

59:41.669 --> 59:42.771
- What?
- You know who you're looking at?

59:42.871 --> 59:43.838
Who the hell do you think you are?

59:43.938 --> 59:45.173
- You know who you're looking at?
- What?

59:45.273 --> 59:47.048
You're looking at your son in 30 years!

59:47.842 --> 59:48.946
That's right!

59:49.577 --> 59:52.353
My father was a belligerent ass, too!

59:57.352 --> 59:59.020
- Get out.
- I don't think you understand

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.655
- the potential he has.
- Get out!

01:00:00.755 --> 01:00:01.856
Don't talk to me.

01:00:01.956 --> 01:00:03.858
Listen, your son is an intelligent kid.

01:00:03.958 --> 01:00:05.794
I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:08.563
Before it gets ugly.

01:00:08.663 --> 01:00:10.939
Get the... Get out of my house.

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:20.141
Listen, Lorenzo's gonna be fine.

01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:22.610
He's gonna survive you.
He's doing great.

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:24.846
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So, I understand now.

01:00:24.946 --> 01:00:27.119
You wanna be his father, huh?

01:00:27.882 --> 01:00:30.385
Is that what this is?
You wanna be his father?

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:32.231
Let me tell you what that means.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:35.056
That means you gotta be there every day

01:00:35.156 --> 01:00:37.525
even if you have nothing. Okay?

01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:42.597
And you gotta be there
and hide him when ICE comes

01:00:42.697 --> 01:00:45.433
and knocks on your door
and takes your wife.

01:00:45.533 --> 01:00:48.303
And every time
that he gives you disrespect,

01:00:48.403 --> 01:00:50.305
or he misbehave, or get into trouble,

01:00:50.405 --> 01:00:52.173
you gotta wonder to yourself,

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:54.253
maybe I saved the wrong one?

01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:56.444
Okay?

01:00:56.544 --> 01:00:58.012
And you still gotta look
over your shoulder

01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:00.782
every day in case they come back.

01:01:00.882 --> 01:01:03.385
Is that what you want?
You want this job?

01:01:06.154 --> 01:01:07.792
I didn't think so.

01:01:19.167 --> 01:01:20.407
Let's go.

01:01:26.774 --> 01:01:29.220
Mr. Santillan, I just don't think
we need to end things like this.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.950
What was that?

01:01:35.049 --> 01:01:37.495
You invited...

01:01:37.919 --> 01:01:39.262
My house?

01:01:39.387 --> 01:01:41.765
And you treat him like
some kind of hero of yours?

01:01:43.224 --> 01:01:45.994
Don't ever do that to me
or disrespect in this house!

01:01:46.094 --> 01:01:47.505
I work hard for you!

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:52.277
I give you one job to take care of
your brother and you screw that up!

01:01:52.533 --> 01:01:55.013
Don't ever talk to me like that again!

01:02:14.622 --> 01:02:16.795
Hello, John Densmore, please.

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:19.330
Fredi Cameron calling.

01:02:20.995 --> 01:02:24.265
Can you let John know
that I've been thinking about it,

01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:28.136
and, I wanted to check
and see if the job was still available.

01:02:28.236 --> 01:02:31.115
I'm an engineer.
That's what I know how to do.

01:02:32.106 --> 01:02:33.374
Thank you, that's great.

01:02:33.474 --> 01:02:34.976
Yeah, he can reach me here anytime.

01:02:35.076 --> 01:02:37.579
I appreciate it. Thank you. Bye-bye.

01:02:38.947 --> 01:02:41.416
No, no, no, no. You're going.

01:02:41.516 --> 01:02:42.654
Hey, I can't.

01:02:43.184 --> 01:02:45.019
Lorenzo, we cannot do this without you.

01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:46.387
Like I said, I can't.

01:02:46.487 --> 01:02:48.823
I need this. It has to happen!

01:02:48.923 --> 01:02:49.901
Yeah, screw you!

01:02:51.993 --> 01:02:53.597
What did you say?

01:02:54.862 --> 01:02:56.097
I dare you to say it to my face.

01:02:56.197 --> 01:02:57.265
Look, I'm not afraid of you.

01:02:57.365 --> 01:03:01.069
All right, some paisano think he's gonna
be Captain America, huh?

01:03:01.169 --> 01:03:02.403
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah?

01:03:02.503 --> 01:03:04.983
Hot shot. Think you're a big man?

01:03:05.306 --> 01:03:06.580
You think you're better than me?

01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:09.477
Come on, guys, cut it out!

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:10.612
Now!

01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:16.119
What's going on?

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:18.029
You really have to ask?

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.173
You know what?

01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:31.910
We keep going.

01:03:32.567 --> 01:03:34.638
The rest of us. Without him.

01:03:35.236 --> 01:03:38.172
We'll just spend the next day and a half
splitting up Lorenzo's stuff.

01:03:38.272 --> 01:03:40.252
Bro. You good with that?

01:03:41.376 --> 01:03:43.083
It's a blow to the team.

01:03:45.179 --> 01:03:47.489
If you guys still wanna compete,

01:03:48.816 --> 01:03:50.251
I guess we could go if you want to.

01:03:50.351 --> 01:03:51.819
Are you even gonna be there?

01:03:51.919 --> 01:03:53.421
Of course I am.
What are you talking about?

01:03:53.521 --> 01:03:55.467
You know what I'm talking about,
Mr. Cameron.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:56.962
He was talking on the phone.

01:03:57.592 --> 01:03:59.661
With some guy named John-somebody.

01:03:59.761 --> 01:04:00.899
What's he talking about?

01:04:02.764 --> 01:04:04.499
It's got nothing to do
with the competition.

01:04:04.599 --> 01:04:06.467
What's got nothing to do
with the competition?

01:04:06.567 --> 01:04:10.037
He's taking a job. He's leaving us.

01:04:11.239 --> 01:04:12.440
I haven't decided yet.

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:13.541
Are you or not?

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:14.745
Just tell us.

01:04:17.245 --> 01:04:19.514
You know, what if I am? Okay?

01:04:19.614 --> 01:04:22.383
I'm an engineer.
I'm not a teacher. It's not what I do.

01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:25.828
It's not gonna interfere with Santa Barbara,
so what's the big deal?

01:04:27.188 --> 01:04:28.690
Right, it's not a big deal.

01:04:40.201 --> 01:04:41.339
Hey, go get 'em.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.120
Hell!

01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:22.744
You almost ruined your surprise!

01:05:22.844 --> 01:05:25.154
Come here. Hi.

01:05:25.613 --> 01:05:27.024
Can we talk?

01:05:28.182 --> 01:05:29.252
Yeah.

01:05:37.692 --> 01:05:39.394
Are you trying to break up with me?

01:05:39.494 --> 01:05:42.532
Without a dead weight,
you can have a normal life.

01:05:43.297 --> 01:05:45.199
- Real jobs. College.
- I don't think so.

01:05:45.299 --> 01:05:47.735
If you don't wanna be with me,
then let that be that.

01:05:47.835 --> 01:05:50.111
Don't be trying to set me free.

01:05:51.105 --> 01:05:53.408
I don't give up that easily
and neither do you.

01:05:53.508 --> 01:05:55.076
I can't go home!

01:05:55.176 --> 01:05:58.646
I slept on the school floor last night.
In the bathroom!

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.887
It is not fair to you.

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:04.852
You do not wanna be with someone
who can get picked up anytime, anywhere!

01:06:04.952 --> 01:06:07.228
I do if that guy's you!

01:06:15.363 --> 01:06:17.765
There are things that I can't change.

01:06:17.865 --> 01:06:19.100
You know what?

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.647
If you find Oscar,
tell him to open that in California.

01:06:32.813 --> 01:06:33.791
Excuse me!

01:06:34.815 --> 01:06:36.260
Can I talk to you a second?

01:07:09.584 --> 01:07:12.565
You should know upfront,
it's not possible to make me feel any worse.

01:07:13.221 --> 01:07:14.632
We'll see.

01:07:17.225 --> 01:07:19.296
I heard you got a real job.

01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:22.641
That's nice for you.

01:07:23.231 --> 01:07:25.837
Okay, I was wrong. I could feel worse.

01:07:26.367 --> 01:07:29.405
Here's the thing
about winning someone's trust.

01:07:30.805 --> 01:07:32.284
You don't break it.

01:07:33.574 --> 01:07:35.510
Every day in a hundred ways,

01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:38.216
they are told that they are worthless.

01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:41.417
That they are beyond hope.

01:07:42.583 --> 01:07:45.119
Just when they think
that maybe they're wrong,

01:07:45.219 --> 01:07:47.495
you just straightened them out.

01:07:49.724 --> 01:07:52.762
They're not adults. They're kids.

01:07:55.663 --> 01:07:57.438
They need protection.

01:08:06.941 --> 01:08:07.976
Who's that?

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:15.054
That was my daughter, Rosie.

01:08:16.651 --> 01:08:18.252
My wife was driving her to Gymboree

01:08:18.352 --> 01:08:20.764
and a Range Rover ran a red light.

01:08:21.522 --> 01:08:23.001
She was three.

01:08:26.761 --> 01:08:29.063
And the worst thing,

01:08:29.162 --> 01:08:33.077
where my wife was at in the accident,

01:08:33.634 --> 01:08:34.805
she wasn't hurt at all.

01:08:38.706 --> 01:08:40.652
She never got over that.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:46.990
We never got over it.

01:08:47.548 --> 01:08:48.618
So...

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.620
I go from job to job.

01:08:52.553 --> 01:08:56.433
And then I show up here.
And I find these kids.

01:09:06.634 --> 01:09:08.636
And the more they need me,

01:09:10.136 --> 01:09:12.207
the more I start to wonder,

01:09:14.475 --> 01:09:16.078
am I up for this?

01:09:20.014 --> 01:09:21.993
Am I gonna let them down?

01:09:35.863 --> 01:09:37.274
Are you?

01:09:44.772 --> 01:09:45.978
In five years,

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:49.277
you guys might not even
remember my name.

01:09:49.377 --> 01:09:52.654
But you'll always regret
that you had a chance to see the ocean,

01:09:53.413 --> 01:09:55.052
and you didn't go.

01:09:58.753 --> 01:10:00.562
You sure you got time for us?

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:10.566
More than anything else in the world.

01:10:14.769 --> 01:10:17.579
You really wanna smuggle
four illegals across state lines?

01:10:19.807 --> 01:10:22.076
Yeah, put you guys on top of the van.

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:24.211
Cover you with a blanket.

01:10:24.311 --> 01:10:25.949
You'll look like picnic equipment.

01:10:53.474 --> 01:10:55.010
Welcome to California, guys!

01:11:10.858 --> 01:11:12.769
Look! The Pacific Ocean!

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:46.928
This is it.

01:11:47.561 --> 01:11:50.097
Hey. That line's shorter.

01:11:50.197 --> 01:11:51.432
That's the Explorer class.

01:11:51.532 --> 01:11:53.808
That's the division
that's meant for colleges.

01:11:54.635 --> 01:11:55.943
Meant for?

01:11:57.371 --> 01:12:00.784
Could we enter with them
if we wanted to?

01:12:02.576 --> 01:12:04.745
If we come in last
against other high schools,

01:12:04.845 --> 01:12:06.547
then it'll be humiliating.

01:12:06.647 --> 01:12:08.482
But if we come in last
against other colleges, then,

01:12:08.582 --> 01:12:10.562
it'll be, like, expected.

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:14.822
Plus, look, even if we beat one college,

01:12:14.922 --> 01:12:17.825
we'd have to feel pretty good
about ourselves, right, guys?

01:12:17.925 --> 01:12:20.661
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's a good idea.

01:12:20.761 --> 01:12:21.831
I like it. Come on.

01:12:22.329 --> 01:12:23.637
You guys in high school?

01:12:24.532 --> 01:12:25.866
Carl Hayden Community.

01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:27.701
After the senator from Arizona?

01:12:27.801 --> 01:12:31.146
Yeah. It was renamed after him in 1957.

01:12:31.605 --> 01:12:32.777
He's our brain.

01:12:33.407 --> 01:12:35.409
But, not exclusively.

01:12:35.509 --> 01:12:36.920
I'm kind of a rounded kind of guy.

01:12:37.945 --> 01:12:39.346
That's different.

01:12:39.446 --> 01:12:42.950
No, I mean, it's like analog, you know.
Old school.

01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:45.252
Is that a CCD camera in there?

01:12:45.352 --> 01:12:46.353
Yes.

01:12:48.088 --> 01:12:49.990
The male side of the PVC union

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:51.859
holds it with the O-ring
in the face plate,

01:12:51.959 --> 01:12:52.993
and the female side is the

01:12:53.093 --> 01:12:55.539
- polycarbonate cover.
- Polycarbonate cover.

01:12:57.398 --> 01:12:59.605
Very cool. Have you seen MIT's yet?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.535
Apparently, it's under
a tarp or something.

01:13:01.635 --> 01:13:03.376
But it looks like the Death Star.

01:13:03.771 --> 01:13:05.546
Anyway, good luck out there.

01:13:26.894 --> 01:13:30.331
Okay, guys, let's surface
and put Stinky into position.

01:13:30.431 --> 01:13:32.638
Okay. Pitch 40 degrees up, Lorenzo?

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:35.803
I'm trying. It's not, like, working.

01:13:35.903 --> 01:13:37.382
Okay, wait a minute.
I can't go left either.

01:13:39.139 --> 01:13:40.243
What's going on?

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:42.479
Look, I'm pulling it all the way back,
but it won't go up.

01:13:45.346 --> 01:13:46.620
Pull Stinky. Pull him now.

01:14:11.171 --> 01:14:12.673
A millimeter, maybe two.

01:14:12.773 --> 01:14:14.548
But enough to short your electrical
during your run.

01:14:14.675 --> 01:14:15.976
Can't we just smooth it out?

01:14:16.076 --> 01:14:19.246
No, if you mess with the seal,
you always make it worse.

01:14:19.346 --> 01:14:20.689
How do we fix it?

01:14:23.684 --> 01:14:25.753
Wait. Who says we gotta fix it?

01:14:25.853 --> 01:14:26.854
Luis, give me your sock.

01:14:29.023 --> 01:14:30.057
So, what do you think, sir?

01:14:30.157 --> 01:14:31.458
I mean, I like it.

01:14:31.558 --> 01:14:33.227
It at least buys you time
for a longer run,

01:14:33.327 --> 01:14:35.362
but, I think we could do better
than a sock,

01:14:35.462 --> 01:14:38.699
a towel or a sponge?
I mean, let's think.

01:14:38.799 --> 01:14:41.370
What's small and really absorbent?

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:43.270
Not it.

01:14:43.537 --> 01:14:44.538
What's not it?

01:14:45.039 --> 01:14:46.347
It's not gonna be me.

01:15:18.205 --> 01:15:20.174
Men buy women tampons
all the time, guys.

01:15:20.274 --> 01:15:21.912
It's not a big deal.

01:15:22.676 --> 01:15:23.916
So, why don't you go do it?

01:15:24.044 --> 01:15:25.614
I ain't going in there.

01:15:33.087 --> 01:15:34.788
Excuse me, lady?

01:15:34.888 --> 01:15:36.423
Sorry to bother you.

01:15:36.523 --> 01:15:39.026
We're with this robotics competition
with NASA.

01:15:39.126 --> 01:15:41.662
And our robot had a leak in the brain.

01:15:41.762 --> 01:15:46.871
We were wondering if we could
soak the water up with something.

01:15:47.367 --> 01:15:49.142
You want my help with what exactly?

01:15:49.636 --> 01:15:53.743
You know, the things, that ladies use.

01:15:56.076 --> 01:15:57.282
You mean tampons.

01:16:22.469 --> 01:16:25.506
Hey, hey, guys?
These things are amazing.

01:16:25.606 --> 01:16:28.382
This just absorbed 80 cc's of water.

01:16:29.343 --> 01:16:32.546
Yeah, the lady said these were best for us
'cause they don't got applicators.

01:16:32.646 --> 01:16:34.421
What does that mean?

01:16:44.892 --> 01:16:47.805
Damn. Guys, guys!

01:16:48.495 --> 01:16:49.565
Come and take a look at this.

01:16:50.531 --> 01:16:52.511
Come on. That was perfect when I did it.

01:16:52.633 --> 01:16:54.201
The sun was beating down
on it the whole time.

01:16:54.301 --> 01:16:56.270
Please tell me that we can fix this.

01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:59.073
Well, you'd have to start fresh.
You'd have to lose all this,

01:16:59.173 --> 01:17:02.776
re-strip the wires and you'd have
to re-solder every one of the pins.

01:17:02.876 --> 01:17:04.545
Okay, let's go, come on. Let's do it.

01:17:04.645 --> 01:17:06.124
Hey, it took me five hours
the first time.

01:17:06.513 --> 01:17:07.681
So?

01:17:07.781 --> 01:17:09.049
So, it's late.

01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:12.186
You know, if I nod off and nick one pin,
the whole connector would be shot.

01:17:12.286 --> 01:17:13.353
I mean, Stinky'd be dead.

01:17:13.453 --> 01:17:15.490
Stinky's as good as dead
if you don't do anything.

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:18.532
Our chances are a lot better
if you help.

01:17:28.202 --> 01:17:29.579
Right there.

01:17:33.173 --> 01:17:34.942
Look, I said some stuff about you

01:17:35.042 --> 01:17:37.277
and the army and everything
and it wasn't cool.

01:17:37.377 --> 01:17:38.879
It's all right.

01:17:40.347 --> 01:17:42.486
I didn't mean it when I called you
a pinche pendejo either.

01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:46.195
- You never said that.
- You weren't around.

01:17:50.891 --> 01:17:52.928
Why'd you wanna join
the army so bad, anyways?

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:56.297
I wanted to serve
ever since I was a little kid.

01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:57.898
They don't want us here.

01:17:57.998 --> 01:17:59.875
They're the ones
that are trying to kick us out.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.676
They took my mom back to Mexico.

01:18:03.704 --> 01:18:06.480
I mean, I haven't seen her
for six years.

01:18:09.743 --> 01:18:11.051
I'm sorry.

01:18:13.914 --> 01:18:17.054
I can't even imagine
how hard that must be.

01:18:19.152 --> 01:18:22.429
All right, there. One down, 31 to go!

01:18:34.635 --> 01:18:36.512
Come on, buddy, get up.

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:43.177
Oscar, I know
it's not the uniform you wanted to wear.

01:18:43.277 --> 01:18:45.546
But you're a team
and I wanted you to look like one.

01:18:45.646 --> 01:18:48.217
I'm proud of you. I love you. Karla.

01:18:59.293 --> 01:19:00.738
Hey, buddy. Hey, here!

01:19:01.595 --> 01:19:02.972
Hey! I'm up!

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:27.256
Welcome, everyone, to the Fifth
Annual Underwater ROV championship!

01:19:28.455 --> 01:19:30.791
Gathered here today
are some of the best and brightest

01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:33.660
from 32 schools and 17states!

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.129
At the bottom of this pool
lies Mystery Reef

01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:39.642
where a World War II sub
has been lodged for 50 years.

01:19:40.167 --> 01:19:43.270
Each team will conduct
an eight-part mission with tasks

01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:47.978
worth between five and 15 points
for a total of 100 points.

01:19:48.575 --> 01:19:50.521
Now, every time you hear this...

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:54.081
A team has successfully
completed a task.

01:19:54.181 --> 01:19:55.216
But if you hear this...

01:19:56.383 --> 01:19:57.584
Not so successful.

01:19:57.684 --> 01:19:59.586
But with any luck, when time is up

01:19:59.686 --> 01:20:02.155
they've made it onto our leader board.

01:20:02.255 --> 01:20:06.894
Now, remember, this mission test
is worth 70% of the final score.

01:20:06.994 --> 01:20:10.771
Which leaves 30% for the oral
questioning with our judges.

01:20:11.198 --> 01:20:13.867
Here we go, folks.
Let's get to the first team.

01:20:13.967 --> 01:20:17.608
Mission order has been randomly selected,
and the first school up is,

01:20:18.005 --> 01:20:19.039
Virginia Tech.

01:20:19.139 --> 01:20:23.349
With 15 minutes on the clock,
your time starts now.

01:20:23.477 --> 01:20:27.514
It's worth noting that teams
are allowed to come back to any task

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:29.883
that they might have missed
the first time around.

01:20:29.983 --> 01:20:32.619
Now, all the tasks down there
can be completed in any order

01:20:32.719 --> 01:20:34.288
except the first one.

01:20:34.388 --> 01:20:35.555
Opening the hatch.

01:20:35.655 --> 01:20:39.059
Teams must complete
that first task within 60 seconds.

01:20:39.159 --> 01:20:40.627
If they fail to do so,

01:20:40.727 --> 01:20:45.403
then a diver will be forced
to do it for them for a five point loss.

01:20:53.106 --> 01:20:54.107
Yes!

01:20:55.042 --> 01:20:56.783
And we're off! That's five points.

01:21:10.123 --> 01:21:11.397
Ten more points.

01:21:19.066 --> 01:21:20.367
And five more points.

01:21:20.467 --> 01:21:22.640
This bar is going to be set high.

01:21:22.969 --> 01:21:25.072
That's all right.
Don't let it rattle you.

01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:27.743
They did the first three things, like,
in two minutes!

01:21:28.308 --> 01:21:29.509
One minute and 42 seconds.

01:21:29.609 --> 01:21:31.316
Maybe it's not that hard.

01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:39.687
Next up is Cornell University.

01:22:15.922 --> 01:22:17.265
Give us more tether!

01:22:19.025 --> 01:22:20.629
It's not helping.

01:22:24.431 --> 01:22:26.342
Next up, Duke University.

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:33.149
Stanford!

01:22:34.274 --> 01:22:35.480
Florida!

01:22:36.676 --> 01:22:40.556
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the reigning champs, MIT!

01:22:56.963 --> 01:23:00.376
- What's that?
- School full of hims.

01:23:02.135 --> 01:23:05.207
Last year, they doubled the score
of their closest competitor.

01:23:06.773 --> 01:23:11.244
Wow! This year, MIT has incorporated
modularity into their design.

01:23:11.611 --> 01:23:15.559
What an elegant way for them to access
all their different components.

01:23:19.653 --> 01:23:21.963
And you may begin now.

01:23:28.862 --> 01:23:31.103
A quick five points for MIT!

01:23:35.368 --> 01:23:36.470
That's another 10 points!

01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:38.880
It's the quickest pace we've seen yet.

01:23:39.105 --> 01:23:42.209
Do you remember when I said that this
division would be less embarrassing for us?

01:23:42.309 --> 01:23:43.543
- Yeah.
- Yeah, maybe next time,

01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:45.054
you shouldn't listen to me.

01:23:46.947 --> 01:23:47.948
What are they doing?

01:23:48.048 --> 01:23:49.282
This is interesting.

01:23:49.382 --> 01:23:52.219
They seem to be
bypassing two tasks entirely.

01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:54.821
If that's a strategy, it's a strange one

01:23:54.921 --> 01:23:56.423
to go that far off course

01:23:56.523 --> 01:23:57.891
and then have to double back.

01:23:57.991 --> 01:23:59.561
Activate the dual lasers.

01:24:01.861 --> 01:24:05.732
That's what you get for doubting
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:07.968
At this point, the only question
seems to be

01:24:08.068 --> 01:24:10.437
how fast they'll complete the tasks.

01:24:10.537 --> 01:24:11.811
That makes 70!

01:24:13.873 --> 01:24:15.978
Engage the LED floods on my count.

01:24:16.376 --> 01:24:19.255
Three, two, one.

01:24:25.085 --> 01:24:28.488
That's 85 points.
They've taken over first place, people!

01:24:28.588 --> 01:24:31.762
Just one task away now
from a perfect score.

01:24:32.092 --> 01:24:33.493
Remember, there's the oral questioning.

01:24:33.593 --> 01:24:36.963
You can make up the ground there
if you need to.

01:24:37.063 --> 01:24:39.669
English isn't even our first language.

01:24:45.672 --> 01:24:46.776
Additional tether, please.

01:24:50.477 --> 01:24:51.444
Hang on here a moment.

01:24:51.544 --> 01:24:54.024
Looks like MIT has run
into some trouble.

01:24:55.915 --> 01:24:59.158
They appear to be caught,
putting their cage out of reach.

01:25:11.931 --> 01:25:16.846
Wow! MIT has determined
the final task to be impossible.

01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:19.873
So, with six minutes left,
they're stopping!

01:25:19.973 --> 01:25:22.809
But they've still taken
the lead with 85 points.

01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:25.645
Let's see if that score holds up
with our final team,

01:25:25.745 --> 01:25:27.725
- Carl Hayden Community High School.
- Let's go, guys, all right!

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:29.818
Carl Hayden?

01:25:32.452 --> 01:25:35.522
Okay, guy, come on!
Stay focused and work together, okay?

01:25:35.622 --> 01:25:38.899
Carl Hayden, your time starts now.

01:25:39.559 --> 01:25:41.129
All right, Luis, drop Stinky.

01:25:43.563 --> 01:25:45.232
Okay, guys. We got this.

01:25:45.332 --> 01:25:47.133
All right, going straight ahead.

01:25:47.233 --> 01:25:50.077
Three meters down.
Okay, controllers are reliable now.

01:25:50.337 --> 01:25:51.571
Okay, but we gotta move fast.

01:25:51.671 --> 01:25:53.340
They're only giving us 60 seconds
for the first task.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.475
I got no problem with fast.

01:25:57.177 --> 01:25:58.713
Steady.

01:25:59.879 --> 01:26:01.324
Come on. Come on!

01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:04.455
It looks as though Carl Hayden
is having a difficult time

01:26:04.584 --> 01:26:05.756
with the very first task.

01:26:06.186 --> 01:26:08.321
Guys, we can still make it.
We still can. Come on.

01:26:08.421 --> 01:26:10.190
Man, get out of there, dude.
We're not gonna need you.

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:12.736
Not a very promising start
for this young team.

01:26:13.593 --> 01:26:15.161
- Come on!
- We still can, come on.

01:26:15.261 --> 01:26:16.329
Focus, focus.

01:26:16.429 --> 01:26:17.772
Ten seconds!

01:26:20.633 --> 01:26:21.701
They're out of time!

01:26:21.801 --> 01:26:23.503
There goes the diver to open the hatch.

01:26:23.603 --> 01:26:25.505
That's a five point loss.

01:26:25.605 --> 01:26:28.508
But, you know, Ken, isn't it a win
just to get on the course at all?

01:26:28.608 --> 01:26:31.278
Guys, it's only five points.
There are 95 more in there.

01:26:31.378 --> 01:26:33.380
Hey, enough with the red light.
Turn it off.

01:26:38.551 --> 01:26:40.186
- Come on, come on.
- Okay, Lorenzo,

01:26:40.286 --> 01:26:41.488
I'm going three degrees down.

01:26:41.588 --> 01:26:43.829
- Could you be more exact?
- 2.73 degrees.

01:26:47.527 --> 01:26:49.596
- Steady, steady.
- Clamp! Clamp!

01:26:49.696 --> 01:26:51.398
Come on. Just a little more.

01:26:51.498 --> 01:26:53.171
We got it! Yes! Yes!

01:26:54.467 --> 01:26:56.310
Correct! That's 10 points
for Carl Hayden.

01:26:56.436 --> 01:26:57.574
There you go!

01:27:00.974 --> 01:27:02.214
Steady.

01:27:02.876 --> 01:27:05.186
All right, easy, easy, easy!

01:27:06.846 --> 01:27:08.154
Grab it!

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:10.450
There's half the task, folks.

01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:13.586
Let's see if they can complete
the second half for a full 10 points.

01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:15.825
- Pick it up!
- We got this.

01:27:17.724 --> 01:27:18.825
Come on!

01:27:18.925 --> 01:27:21.428
Just forget the bell.
We'll come back for it.

01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:23.030
Time to go recover the Enigma.

01:27:23.329 --> 01:27:25.565
Looks like they're bypassing
the second part, folks.

01:27:25.665 --> 01:27:27.144
That's another five point loss.

01:27:27.267 --> 01:27:30.805
But they did get those first 5 points,
so they're up to 20 points.

01:27:32.472 --> 01:27:33.542
Five points ain't nothing.

01:27:36.976 --> 01:27:38.211
Watch yourself.

01:27:38.311 --> 01:27:40.484
- Steady, stay steady!
- I'm gonna fix it.

01:27:41.314 --> 01:27:43.157
Go! Yes!

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.621
I love that sound.

01:27:48.721 --> 01:27:50.990
And Carl Hayden has another 10 points.

01:27:51.090 --> 01:27:53.161
That's 30, with half
of the course still to go.

01:27:53.993 --> 01:27:57.440
You hear that? It's halftime, boys.
Let's finish strong.

01:27:58.198 --> 01:28:00.700
There they go, toward the hard stuff.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.144
Come on, Stinky, get it on there.
Drop it steady.

01:28:03.603 --> 01:28:05.038
Easy! Easy!

01:28:05.138 --> 01:28:07.550
Come on, there we go, there we go.

01:28:08.541 --> 01:28:10.612
Come on! Come on!

01:28:10.977 --> 01:28:12.178
Steady, yes, yes!

01:28:12.278 --> 01:28:13.713
There we go. There we go.

01:28:13.813 --> 01:28:15.749
All right, guys.
How far are we from the back wall?

01:28:15.849 --> 01:28:17.784
Well, if we knew,
we wouldn't have to measure it.

01:28:17.884 --> 01:28:19.591
Well, we need to be careful
not to because...

01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:23.158
- Wait, hold on! Is it broken?
- No, look, it's still on.

01:28:24.157 --> 01:28:25.693
Easy, easy.

01:28:29.562 --> 01:28:30.663
Analog.

01:28:30.763 --> 01:28:32.832
Another 15 points for Carl Hayden!

01:28:32.932 --> 01:28:35.001
That's 45 points.

01:28:35.101 --> 01:28:36.944
All right, Lorenzo, toggle to the camera
near the thermometer.

01:28:37.337 --> 01:28:40.546
And it looks like
it's one meter down and 15 degrees left.

01:28:51.251 --> 01:28:53.697
Guys, we need to remove the blue wire.

01:28:54.187 --> 01:28:55.564
That light one
probably isn't blue, right?

01:28:55.688 --> 01:28:57.031
We should've sprang for a color monitor.

01:28:59.325 --> 01:29:02.363
It's 50-50. Which one do you like?

01:29:03.296 --> 01:29:04.531
That one.

01:29:04.631 --> 01:29:06.702
No, no, no, wait!
That one! That one! That one!

01:29:11.671 --> 01:29:13.740
They disconnected the wrong wire!

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:16.184
That's a 15 point loss.

01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:19.556
- Damn it! Sorry, guys.
- We got time left?

01:29:20.446 --> 01:29:22.315
- Let's go get the bell.
- Wait, isn't there one more thing?

01:29:22.415 --> 01:29:25.185
- Whatever's in the cave.
- All right! Let's go do it.

01:29:25.285 --> 01:29:27.629
Oscar? Nobody else got it!

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:29.656
MIT said it was impossible.

01:29:29.756 --> 01:29:31.724
Good thing we're dumb high school kids
who don't get that.

01:29:31.824 --> 01:29:35.161
Okay! Based on what we already did,

01:29:35.261 --> 01:29:38.868
the process of elimination means
the task inside is extracting the liquid.

01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:42.971
Just a little more tether!

01:29:44.237 --> 01:29:45.238
Luis, more tether!

01:29:48.508 --> 01:29:50.343
We got this! We got this!

01:29:50.443 --> 01:29:52.081
All right, keep going straight.
Two more meters.

01:29:53.947 --> 01:29:56.018
You got it. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:29:57.016 --> 01:29:59.087
- I can't.
- We must be caught.

01:29:59.619 --> 01:30:01.020
It cannot be the tether.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.655
Guys, try another angle.

01:30:02.755 --> 01:30:05.258
Go back. Back 10 degrees.

01:30:08.461 --> 01:30:11.169
Ten degrees left! Stay steady!

01:30:11.798 --> 01:30:15.075
It looks like their thinner tether
is enabling them to get inside the cave!

01:30:15.501 --> 01:30:18.243
Wow! We're in
unchartered territories now, folks.

01:30:19.038 --> 01:30:20.073
All right, we're in now!

01:30:20.473 --> 01:30:21.679
Take it easy!

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:25.523
All right, Lorenzo, pump.

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:28.915
The pump's working!

01:30:29.015 --> 01:30:30.483
We got fluid and pressure!

01:30:30.583 --> 01:30:32.352
All right, vamos, surface,
surface, come on!

01:30:32.452 --> 01:30:34.821
Okay, 2.5 meters up and 30 degrees left!

01:30:34.921 --> 01:30:36.423
Luis, stand by to grab the balloon.

01:30:42.595 --> 01:30:43.665
Yeah!

01:30:44.764 --> 01:30:45.742
All right!

01:30:48.968 --> 01:30:51.804
Those are my boys! My boys!

01:30:51.904 --> 01:30:53.606
Wow! With 75 points,

01:30:53.706 --> 01:30:57.243
Carl Hayden has risen to fourth place
with 40 seconds left!

01:30:57.343 --> 01:30:58.711
- We still have the bell, right?
- Yeah.

01:30:58.811 --> 01:31:00.780
Luis, put Stinky back in the water!
Hurry!

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:01.915
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:31:02.015 --> 01:31:04.284
Carl Hayden is going back for the bell.

01:31:04.384 --> 01:31:05.552
Come on, Stinky, come on!

01:31:05.652 --> 01:31:08.755
If they find that bell,
they'll be in the top three.

01:31:08.855 --> 01:31:10.490
What are you doing?

01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:11.758
Well, the monitors are dead.

01:31:11.858 --> 01:31:13.426
We're not gonna stop
until the clock runs out.

01:31:13.526 --> 01:31:15.563
Okay, grab the bell
and get it back on the hook.

01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:19.866
- Come on, come on!
- Ten, nine...

01:31:19.966 --> 01:31:21.467
The engines are at full power.

01:31:21.567 --> 01:31:23.569
- Balance it out.
- Eight, seven...

01:31:23.670 --> 01:31:26.573
Six, five, four...

01:31:26.673 --> 01:31:28.983
Three...

01:31:29.409 --> 01:31:31.116
Two, one!

01:31:32.645 --> 01:31:34.814
Time's up! So, here are the standings

01:31:34.914 --> 01:31:36.983
after the mission portion
of the competition.

01:31:37.083 --> 01:31:40.353
MIT is in first place with 85 points!

01:31:40.453 --> 01:31:43.723
Cornell and Virginia Tech
are tied for second with 80!

01:31:43.823 --> 01:31:47.669
And in fourth place,
Carl Hayden Community with 75.

01:31:58.905 --> 01:32:00.748
Guys, wait up!

01:32:04.744 --> 01:32:06.018
Don't tell me you're upset.

01:32:06.512 --> 01:32:07.780
We were so close.

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.582
You're in fourth place!

01:32:09.682 --> 01:32:11.753
You beat more than 12 colleges.

01:32:12.485 --> 01:32:16.661
You have a chance to take home a bronze
trophy if you do well in the orals.

01:32:18.524 --> 01:32:19.867
He's right.

01:32:23.763 --> 01:32:24.831
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening.

01:32:24.931 --> 01:32:25.966
Is Oscar Vazquez at home?

01:32:26.365 --> 01:32:27.400
What is this about?

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.702
I'm here to talk to him
about the application he filed

01:32:29.802 --> 01:32:31.372
to enlist in the United States Army.

01:32:31.871 --> 01:32:33.172
Is he being reconsidered?

01:32:33.272 --> 01:32:35.377
Well, that's what I'd like
to talk to him about.

01:32:36.075 --> 01:32:37.777
He'll be so sorry he missed you.

01:32:37.877 --> 01:32:38.978
He's away this weekend.

01:32:39.078 --> 01:32:41.058
But he'll be back to this address?

01:32:45.418 --> 01:32:48.399
I'm sorry,
did I make you think he lives here?

01:32:49.288 --> 01:32:53.327
No, he and his mother
moved a couple months ago.

01:33:05.238 --> 01:33:08.014
All right, guys. Time to caffeinate.

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:18.187
You know, before we hit the books too hard,
let's take a field trip.

01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:31.497
So your mom doesn't think
you should come back at all, huh?

01:33:31.597 --> 01:33:33.338
She just doesn't think it's safe.

01:33:35.401 --> 01:33:38.280
I'm sorry, I just don't see
how this works out for any of us.

01:33:42.608 --> 01:33:45.144
I mean, this is definitely not
how I thought my life would be.

01:33:45.244 --> 01:33:46.951
There was a time not too long ago,

01:33:47.246 --> 01:33:50.420
when I saw my whole life
stretched out before me.

01:33:51.217 --> 01:33:52.628
And honestly, I...

01:33:53.119 --> 01:33:55.224
I didn't see any good in it.

01:33:55.822 --> 01:33:56.989
And you know what happened?

01:33:57.089 --> 01:34:01.128
This pushy kid with a bad haircut
and a flyer walked into my club.

01:34:03.963 --> 01:34:06.773
It's not so bad.
The haircut's not so bad.

01:34:07.667 --> 01:34:09.442
For a guy like you?

01:34:10.403 --> 01:34:12.576
A finish line always appears.

01:34:17.176 --> 01:34:18.450
MIT!

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:25.755
Hey!

01:34:35.761 --> 01:34:37.897
And pulse-width modulation, or PWM,

01:34:37.997 --> 01:34:41.167
controls analog circuits
with digital outputs.

01:34:41.267 --> 01:34:45.938
Right! The motors pulse and the speed
changes by the duration of the pulse.

01:34:46.038 --> 01:34:47.106
Okay.

01:34:47.206 --> 01:34:50.243
Luis, are you sure that you get this,
because we can go over it again.

01:34:50.343 --> 01:34:52.118
Yeah, PWM, I'm good.

01:34:55.548 --> 01:34:57.585
- Okay.
- All right, so...

01:34:57.750 --> 01:35:00.520
Let's talk about weight,
mass and density.

01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:02.355
- Okay.
- All right?

01:35:02.455 --> 01:35:05.664
Mass is like a numerical measure
of its composition.

01:35:06.525 --> 01:35:08.232
All right, guys! I'll be back.

01:35:08.828 --> 01:35:11.035
Let me open to this chapter.

01:35:12.798 --> 01:35:14.539
Gwen? Gwen!

01:35:16.636 --> 01:35:17.671
They're fourth!

01:35:18.304 --> 01:35:19.605
- What?
- Against college kids.

01:35:19.705 --> 01:35:22.542
Yes! How are the boys?
What else did he say?

01:35:22.642 --> 01:35:25.378
He said that they might get the bronze.

01:35:25.478 --> 01:35:27.113
You should be there.

01:35:27.213 --> 01:35:28.848
- They don't need me.
- No! No!

01:35:28.948 --> 01:35:29.983
You need it!

01:35:30.616 --> 01:35:32.351
Here! It's my frequent flyer account.

01:35:32.451 --> 01:35:36.055
There's more than enough miles for two
adults and a kid to get to Santa Barbara.

01:35:36.155 --> 01:35:39.959
No, no, Karen, I can't take this!
You've been saving up forever for this.

01:35:40.059 --> 01:35:42.562
Just let me do this! Please!

01:35:43.029 --> 01:35:44.508
Okay.

01:35:46.332 --> 01:35:49.336
- Mr. Santillan?
- Hey!

01:35:51.304 --> 01:35:52.874
Mr. Santillan.

01:35:57.777 --> 01:35:59.757
Hi! How can I help you?

01:35:59.879 --> 01:36:03.486
I'm Gwen Kolinsky.
I'm from Lorenzo's school.

01:36:04.617 --> 01:36:08.221
We've had a number
of extremely brief conversations.

01:36:08.321 --> 01:36:11.461
- At least the other guy, he brought tequila.
- Mr. Santillan, don't...

01:36:16.796 --> 01:36:19.902
Do you even know
which state your son is in right now?

01:36:23.135 --> 01:36:26.241
Tell us about the materials
you used to construct your ROV.

01:36:26.605 --> 01:36:29.575
Our strain gauge
measured the pressure differential

01:36:29.675 --> 01:36:32.178
across a flexible piece of material

01:36:32.278 --> 01:36:34.724
whose resistance changed
with deflection.

01:36:34.981 --> 01:36:38.155
A welded aluminum box frame,
which facilitated our modular design.

01:36:38.317 --> 01:36:41.354
Well, we used PVC
'cause it's, like waterproof

01:36:41.454 --> 01:36:44.731
and, like buoyant when you seal it off.

01:36:46.225 --> 01:36:48.330
But we had to offset it
with pool noodles.

01:36:51.831 --> 01:36:54.004
Pool noodles.

01:36:56.769 --> 01:36:59.438
Every motor speed controller
and position relay

01:36:59.538 --> 01:37:02.144
has a 20 amp auto reset circuit breaker.

01:37:02.475 --> 01:37:05.845
We had five cameras, sir,
all connected to one video line,

01:37:05.945 --> 01:37:08.687
and we could switch between the cameras
depending on what we needed to see.

01:37:09.015 --> 01:37:10.983
The force is normal
to the surface of the object

01:37:11.083 --> 01:37:14.360
and thus collinear with the radius
of curvature for the gripper at that point.

01:37:14.854 --> 01:37:17.835
Great! Can you explain that
in layman's terms?

01:37:20.092 --> 01:37:22.495
Why did you decide
to put the ROV electronics on board?

01:37:22.595 --> 01:37:25.698
Due to the inefficiency of the motors.
They were 12 volts, 20 amps.

01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:27.500
Why did you use inefficient motors?

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:30.137
'Cause we didn't have money
for the efficient ones.

01:37:32.838 --> 01:37:34.977
Our budget was $12,540.

01:37:35.408 --> 01:37:39.254
The ROV itself? $18,863.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.585
- Just under eight, sir.
- 8,000?

01:37:43.849 --> 01:37:45.453
No, sir! $800.

01:37:46.685 --> 01:37:48.824
Really, $787.16.

01:37:50.923 --> 01:37:53.460
But that doesn't include the tampons,
I don't know how much they cost.

01:37:55.161 --> 01:38:00.474
We had a leak and tampons can, like,
absorb, you know, like 80 cc's of water.

01:38:05.971 --> 01:38:09.851
What's the difference between
weight, mass and density?

01:38:13.579 --> 01:38:16.992
Weight is how much the Earth pulls on you.
Gravity and everything.

01:38:17.316 --> 01:38:20.490
Mass is how much stuff
you're made out of.

01:38:21.087 --> 01:38:24.068
Like, I got a lot of mass,
but I'm not dense,

01:38:24.757 --> 01:38:28.170
'cause density is
how close together all the stuff is.

01:38:30.196 --> 01:38:32.107
No, sir. No outside help at all.

01:38:32.498 --> 01:38:36.844
We had to use 22 gauge wire
for the tether.

01:38:40.272 --> 01:38:42.241
Nope! Did it all ourselves.

01:38:42.341 --> 01:38:43.911
I know that one.

01:38:46.378 --> 01:38:48.324
And just one last thing.

01:38:50.616 --> 01:38:54.996
Are you sure that your advisor
didn't do anything he wasn't supposed to?

01:38:56.388 --> 01:38:57.458
No.

01:38:57.656 --> 01:38:58.691
No?

01:38:59.325 --> 01:39:00.326
Not really.

01:39:00.426 --> 01:39:01.598
Not really, Luis?

01:39:02.361 --> 01:39:04.163
It wasn't anything big,
I swear, it's just...

01:39:04.263 --> 01:39:05.298
Just what?

01:39:08.167 --> 01:39:12.616
Mr. Cameron donated $134.63

01:39:13.239 --> 01:39:15.048
when we were short
at RAKS hardware store.

01:39:17.343 --> 01:39:18.444
Thank you, that's all we need.

01:39:18.544 --> 01:39:20.148
- No, but...
- That's all we need.

01:39:33.692 --> 01:39:35.961
- How'd it go?
- Did you answer their questions?

01:39:36.061 --> 01:39:38.731
You knew everything about the ROV
electronics and the control console?

01:39:38.831 --> 01:39:39.832
Yeah.

01:39:39.932 --> 01:39:40.900
I'm really proud of you, Luis.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.412
Yeah, come here, big guy. Come on.

01:39:50.176 --> 01:39:52.747
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

01:39:59.518 --> 01:40:01.429
I was fully clothed!
I was pulled out of the bottom.

01:40:04.456 --> 01:40:06.759
I was like,
I was gonna eat this, but if I go home,

01:40:06.859 --> 01:40:08.494
I don't want my mom
to be cleaning up after me.

01:40:08.594 --> 01:40:10.733
My mom always told me,
stop after the third piece.

01:40:12.665 --> 01:40:16.302
Hey, and just so you know,
we did look great in your T-shirts.

01:40:16.402 --> 01:40:17.437
I bet you did.

01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:20.414
You remember everything you said?

01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:22.876
About you and me, about not giving up?

01:40:23.776 --> 01:40:24.910
You were right.

01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:26.512
I have to face

01:40:26.612 --> 01:40:29.252
whatever comes my way
and I can't hide anymore.

01:40:30.115 --> 01:40:32.925
- I realize something else, too.
- What's that?

01:40:36.755 --> 01:40:38.098
I love you.

01:40:39.692 --> 01:40:42.962
Hey, that's your girl, right there,
from Cornell. Go talk to her.

01:40:43.062 --> 01:40:45.231
- Come on.
- I'm waiting for the right time.

01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:47.641
- She's right there!
- Okay, okay, I'm going!

01:40:58.344 --> 01:41:01.348
Okay, folks,
everybody take your seats, please.

01:41:03.949 --> 01:41:06.395
On to the awards.

01:41:08.787 --> 01:41:10.357
But before we get to the top three,

01:41:11.190 --> 01:41:14.560
the judges have added an award
for Special Achievement.

01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:17.663
Now this award goes to
a team that really surprised us.

01:41:17.763 --> 01:41:20.466
We've never given an award
to a high school team

01:41:20.566 --> 01:41:22.045
during the college competition before.

01:41:22.334 --> 01:41:25.037
And there's never been
a team quite like them.

01:41:25.137 --> 01:41:26.639
And they are...

01:41:27.239 --> 01:41:28.877
Carl Hayden Community High School.

01:41:31.577 --> 01:41:33.445
So, it's a pity prize.

01:41:33.545 --> 01:41:35.915
Come on up, Carl Hayden,
and receive your special award.

01:41:36.015 --> 01:41:38.222
Special, like,
we're on the short bus or something.

01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:40.921
You guys are in the big leagues, okay,
so hold your heads up.

01:41:41.053 --> 01:41:42.123
Go get the award.

01:41:43.455 --> 01:41:44.763
Go get it.

01:42:06.011 --> 01:42:07.149
Felicidades, guys!

01:42:07.846 --> 01:42:10.019
Did that guy just say "felicidades"?

01:42:10.482 --> 01:42:11.483
There goes third, I guess.

01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:14.420
Forget about the judge
and forget about all of it.

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:16.055
And think about how far we've come.

01:42:16.155 --> 01:42:19.568
And everything that we've gained
that no one can take away from you.

01:42:19.925 --> 01:42:22.303
Third place goes to Cornell.

01:42:41.914 --> 01:42:43.518
Second place goes to...

01:42:43.882 --> 01:42:45.020
MIT.

01:42:49.755 --> 01:42:53.259
Wow, so,
that means Virginia Tech overtook MIT.

01:42:56.895 --> 01:42:59.298
Hey, this is just the beginning.

01:42:59.398 --> 01:43:00.466
Okay, I promise you guys.

01:43:00.566 --> 01:43:02.468
One day, a team from Carl Hayden
is gonna win this thing.

01:43:02.568 --> 01:43:06.572
And when they do, know it was
because of what we started together.

01:43:06.672 --> 01:43:11.043
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor
to announce that first prize

01:43:11.143 --> 01:43:13.646
in the U.S.
Underwater Robotics Championship

01:43:13.746 --> 01:43:15.681
goes to...

01:43:15.781 --> 01:43:17.750
Carl Hayden Community High School.

01:43:17.850 --> 01:43:20.262
Carl Hayden Community High School.

01:43:28.227 --> 01:43:30.138
Carl Hayden Community High School!

01:43:33.465 --> 01:43:34.637
We won?

01:43:46.845 --> 01:43:48.614
No matter what happens up there,

01:43:48.714 --> 01:43:50.990
I don't want the word "Hooters"
coming out of your mouth.

01:44:00.692 --> 01:44:02.069
- Amazing!
- We did it.

01:44:06.398 --> 01:44:07.638
It's Fredi! Guess what?

01:44:08.767 --> 01:44:11.077
What? Yes!

01:44:11.470 --> 01:44:13.347
Dr. Cameron, come here!

01:44:26.418 --> 01:44:28.420
You did it, guys! You did it.

01:44:40.766 --> 01:44:43.502
Attention, students and faculty.

01:44:43.602 --> 01:44:45.411
I have a special announcement.

01:44:46.004 --> 01:44:49.713
Just moments ago, placing first

01:44:50.476 --> 01:44:54.686
in the Fifth Annual
Underwater Robotics Competition,

01:44:56.081 --> 01:44:59.756
Carl Hayden Community High School!

01:45:03.288 --> 01:45:04.631
Hey, Fredi!

01:45:07.059 --> 01:45:09.300
Wow! You made it!

01:45:12.698 --> 01:45:13.836
Do you guys need a moment?

01:45:15.234 --> 01:45:16.668
Thanks for making it awkward.

01:45:16.768 --> 01:45:20.339
Are you guys hungry 'cause I have
an uneaten chicken dinner on my table.

01:45:20.439 --> 01:45:23.242
No, thanks.
The three of us ate on the plane.

01:45:23.342 --> 01:45:24.946
The three of you?

01:45:27.379 --> 01:45:30.849
Spent the whole plane ride
telling him who his son is.

01:45:32.150 --> 01:45:34.653
Gwen, how did you get him on the plane?

01:45:35.921 --> 01:45:39.158
I told him he could take a swing at you

01:45:39.258 --> 01:45:40.862
when he got here.

01:45:43.629 --> 01:45:44.972
Thank you, thank you.

01:46:12.090 --> 01:46:14.229
Did you catch the...

01:46:18.030 --> 01:46:19.065
Yeah.

01:46:58.503 --> 01:47:00.205
Lorenzo! Get your butt over here!
Come on!

01:47:00.305 --> 01:47:02.478
Where is he? Lorenzo!

01:47:10.882 --> 01:47:11.883
Go.

01:47:29.735 --> 01:47:31.237
Hey!

01:47:39.845 --> 01:47:41.017
It's good to see you.

01:47:41.446 --> 01:47:42.925
I'm Cristian.

01:47:43.949 --> 01:47:46.293
- Hi. Lizzy.
- Lizzy.

01:47:46.918 --> 01:47:50.889
Hey, Luis! Fantastic job, man.
You rocked that interview.

01:47:51.223 --> 01:47:54.259
I just wanna thank you
for not disqualifying us.

01:47:54.359 --> 01:47:55.460
For what?

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.267
Mr. Cameron giving us that money.

01:47:59.031 --> 01:48:02.205
Everyone gets their materials paid for.
Why would you think that disqualifies you?

01:48:03.602 --> 01:48:05.946
'Cause when we asked him for money,
that's what he told us.

01:48:07.205 --> 01:48:08.946
Well, maybe he's just cheap.

01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:55.524
In 2009, he graduated
from Arizona State University

01:48:55.654 --> 01:48:57.895
with a degree in mechanical engineering.

01:49:19.311 --> 01:49:22.053
This story of Oscar Vazquez
is a story of America,

01:49:22.481 --> 01:49:24.085
and it's the story of the Dream Act.

01:49:24.816 --> 01:49:28.090
This young man determined
to serve in our military

01:49:28.186 --> 01:49:30.496
was turned away as undocumented.
