00:15.449 --> 00:17.017
BUT REALLY, THEY'RE
JUST TITLES, GUYS.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.253
TITLES ARE MEANINGLESS

00:40.774 --> 00:43.311
THIS IS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO
RELIVE YOUR COLLEGE YEARS.

00:43.344 --> 00:47.448
GOING TO THAT REUNION WOULD HAVE
JUST BEEN ASKING FOR TREBLE.

00:47.481 --> 00:51.152
- WHO SAYS I'M NOT GOING?
- WELL, I MEAN COME ON. YOU HAD A ROUGH YEAR.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.154

DATE, DIDN'T YOU?

01:12.473 --> 01:15.443
BURNED MY TONGUE, YEAH.
SINGED MY EYEBROWS.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.810
THAT'S NOT THE REASON
WHY I'M GOING.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.579

"JOE LONGO, ONE DAY

IT'S OKAY. SOMETIMES EVEN I
DON'T UNDERSTAND MY ART.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.625
ONE THING I DO UNDERSTAND

07:44.131 --> 07:46.166
THE INTERESTING PEOPLE

07:46.199 --> 07:47.868
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE INTERESTING.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.696
AND THANKS FOR NOT TIPPING.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.998
ALL THAT EXTRA MONEY WOULD
HAVE JUST WEIGHED ME DOWN.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.701
YOU'RE SNARKY. I LIKE SNARKY.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.703

NO OFFENSE, JAMIE.

08:50.898 --> 08:54.868

09:18.158 --> 09:22.863

09:32.873 --> 09:34.975
I HEAR COMMENTS LIKE THAT

09:44.117 --> 09:46.887
JIFFY POP FOR GIANTS?
I'VE BEEN SAVING THEM UP.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.556
I'M FLATTERED YOU'VE PUT SO
MUCH THOUGHT INTO MY WORK.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.825
GUSTAVO, YOU KNOW, I THINK
TOLEDO WOULD BE VERY LUCKY

09:51.859 --> 09:53.226
TO HAVE YOUR NEXT INSTALLATION.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.129
I THINK IT WOULD BE
VERY STIMULATING.

09:56.163 --> 10:00.000
- OH?
- FOR THE CITY, NOT JUST ME.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.670
- ( ringing )
- DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT?

10:02.703 --> 10:04.838
NO, IT'S JUST MY NANNY.
HE CAN LEAVE A MESSAGE.

10:04.872 --> 10:08.008
- WHAT IF IT'S ABOUT YOUR KIDS?
- NAH, I LEFT THEM HOME ALONE.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.310
YEAH, THEY'RE FINE. MY NANNY'S
AT HIS COLLEGE REUNION.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.079
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
HE'S CALLING TO SAY.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.914
"I'M HERE HAVING THE
TIME OF MY LIFE.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.582
YOU WERE WRONG, I WAS RIGHT."

10:15.615 --> 10:17.918
YOU WERE RIGHT, I WAS WRONG.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.988
I KNOW I DON'T SAY
THAT VERY OFTEN, MEL.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.957
ALL RIGHT, I'VE NEVER SAID
THAT, BUT WHAT CAN I SAY?

10:23.991 --> 10:25.993
I AM LITERALLY HAVING THE
WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.996
THE ONLY GOOD NEWS IS
THERE'S AN OPEN BAR HERE.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.998
ANYWAY, I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY.
NOPE.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.866
I AM GOING DOWN SWIGGIN'.

10:32.900 --> 10:37.204
I MEAN... I MEAN SWINGIN'.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.874
AW HELL, I MEAN SWIGGIN'.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.610
THE MAYOR SAYS HE'LL GIVE
YOU THE KEY TO THE CITY.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.113
WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY A KEY.
IT'S A MAGNETIC SWIPEY THING,

10:46.146 --> 10:49.016
BUT IT'LL GIVE YOU 10% OFF
ANYTHING AT THE CHILDREN'S MUSEUM.

10:49.049 --> 10:52.285
MEL, PLEASE LISTEN
TO THAT MESSAGE.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.988
THAT BLINKING LIGHT
IS QUITE INSISTENT.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.390
I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST...

10:57.424 --> 10:59.960
You were right, I was wrong.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.962
I know I don't say
that very often, Mel.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.932
All right, I've never said
that, but what can I say?

11:04.965 --> 11:07.034
I am literally having the
worst night of my life.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.171
ISABEL? ISABEL RYAN.

11:11.204 --> 11:14.174
OH MY GOD. JOE LONGO?

11:14.207 --> 11:16.176
- HEY.
- HI.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.346
WOW, YOU ARE NOT FAT AND OLD
LIKE HALF THESE PEOPLE.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.081
AND YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.850
YOU LOOK GREAT.
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.985
THANK YOU. SO DO YOU.

11:25.018 --> 11:29.189
- WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?
- YEAH, LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.759
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW?

11:31.792 --> 11:34.795
UM, WELL, LET'S JUST SAY

11:34.828 --> 11:37.931
I'M SORT OF IN A
POST-AWESOME PHASE.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.667
MM. WELL, YOU AND ME BOTH.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.936
SO LET'S SEE, LAST
TIME I TALKED TO YOU

11:42.970 --> 11:44.838
YOU WERE GONNA GET
MARRIED TO STEVE, RIGHT?

11:44.872 --> 11:46.907
THEN YOU WERE GONNA HEAD TO NEW
YORK TO BECOME AN ACTRESS.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.441
( laughs ) WAS THAT ME?

11:48.475 --> 11:52.445
OKAY WELL, STEVE IS NOW
HAPPILY MARRIED TO ERIC.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.715
- YEP. AND YOU KNOW THAT MUSICAL "LEGALLY BLONDE"?
- YEAH.

11:55.749 --> 11:59.119
I DID 500 PERFORMANCES
AS LEFT MEZZANINE USHER.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.454
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
LIFE HAPPENS, RIGHT?

12:01.488 --> 12:04.925
YOU PICK YOURSELF UP, YOU PICK ON YOUR
LIPSTICK AND YOU GO TO YOUR REUNION.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.160
I DID THAT TOO.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.229
NOT THE LIPSTICK PART THOUGH.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.766
I'VE HAD A FEW CAREER
SETBACKS MYSELF AS OF LATE

12:12.800 --> 12:16.469
AND CURRENTLY I'M
WORKING AS A...

12:16.503 --> 12:20.073
WELL, AS A NANNY.

12:20.107 --> 12:24.144
NANNY! BEIGE MINIVAN!

12:24.177 --> 12:28.748
RECEPTIONIST AT MY BROTHER'S
LAW FIRM AND I TAKE THE BUS!

12:28.782 --> 12:31.284
- ( chuckles )
- HOW COME YOU AND I NEVER WENT OUT?

12:31.318 --> 12:33.987
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS
HAD A GIRLFRIEND,

12:34.021 --> 12:35.422
SOMETIMES MORE THAN ONE.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.791
NOT THAT GUY ANYMORE.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.292
HE WAS SOMETHING THOUGH, HUH?

12:39.326 --> 12:42.395
DO YOU WANT TO FIND A TABLE

12:42.429 --> 12:44.731
AWAY FROM ALL THESE
ANNOYING SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.733
I'D LOVE TO. JUST LET ME
MAKE A QUICK PHONE CALL.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.768
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.943
This is Mel. Leave a message.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.513
( rings )

13:00.547 --> 13:02.149
HELLO, JOE?

13:02.182 --> 13:05.352
STEPH, HEY LOOK, I LEFT
MEL A MESSAGE EARLIER

13:05.385 --> 13:07.487
AND I TOLD HER I WAS HAVING
A TERRIBLE TIME HERE.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.423
BUT MY NIGHT IS SORT OF
TURNING AROUND A LITTLE BIT

13:10.457 --> 13:13.326
AND I MAY BE HOME LATE,

13:13.360 --> 13:15.896
SO CAN YOU JUST
TELL HER THAT I...

13:15.929 --> 13:17.764
( chanting ) CHUG
CHUG CHUG CHUG...

13:17.797 --> 13:21.301
JOE? JOE? WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S TERRIBLE?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.936
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.306
JUST TELL HER TO DISREGARD
THE PREVIOUS MESSAGE, OKAY?

13:26.339 --> 13:28.475
( men chanting ) Chug
chug chug chug...

13:28.508 --> 13:31.211
STEPHANIE? CAN YOU HEAR ME?

13:31.244 --> 13:33.780
STEPHANIE, HELLO?

13:33.813 --> 13:36.483
STEPHANIE... IS THAT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

13:36.516 --> 13:40.020
NO NO, I DO NOT
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.022
I'M JOE LONGO'S GIRLFRIEND.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.924
I NEED TO GET IN THERE.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.193
- I DON'T THINK YOU'RE ON THE LIST.
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

13:46.226 --> 13:49.362
UM, SAYID ALFABI.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.465
- YOU LOOK DIFFERENT.
- SOME OF US WORK OUT.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.837
- TWO MORE COMING UP, ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.308
- MEL.
- JOE!

14:01.341 --> 14:03.443
DARLING, IT'S ME,

14:03.476 --> 14:07.147
YOUR BEAUTIFUL, SMART AND
SUCCESSFUL GIRLFRIEND.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.366
( dance music playing )

14:26.399 --> 14:28.068
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.403
JOE, SWEETHEART, I MISSED YOU.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.540
LOOK, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE. IT SOUNDED
LIKE YOU WERE HAVING A TERRIBLE TIME.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.342
SO COME ON, SHOW ME OFF.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.446
- I SO WANNA MEET ALL OF MY BOYFRIEND'S CLASSMATES.
- MEL!

14:39.479 --> 14:42.482
OH, IS THIS ONE OF THEM?
HI. HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

14:42.515 --> 14:44.551
I'M MEL BURKE, CITY
COUNCILPERSON,

14:44.584 --> 14:47.287
BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW,
JOE'S GIRLFRIEND.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.391
- NO, SHE IS NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.394
I HAVE TO BE HONEST, I'M
NOT HIS GIRLFRIEND.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.196
- I'M HIS FIANCEE.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.231
I JUST CAN'T GET USED
TO SAYING IT OUT LOUD.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.934
- ( squeals )
- NOT THAT GUY ANYMORE, HUH?

15:00.968 --> 15:03.103
- YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL.
- WAIT... WAIT A MINUTE.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.204
NICE MEETING YOU. GREAT SHOES.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.372
SEE YOU AT THE WEDDING.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.874
OOH, WHO'S THAT?
SHE'S PRETTY CUTE.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.410
YEAH, SOMEBODY REALLY GREAT THAT
I WAS JUST RECONNECTING WITH

15:10.443 --> 15:13.913
UNTIL THE LOVE OF MY LIFE SHOWED UP...
MY FAKE FREAKING FIANCEE.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.416
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. NOT TO WORRY.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.119
I'M GREAT WITH PEOPLE. I WILL JUST
GO OVER THERE AND TALK TO HER.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.653
AND I WILL STRAIGHTEN
THIS OUT IN A JIFF,

15:20.687 --> 15:22.322
WHICH IS SHORTER THAN A JIFFY.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.957
THAT'S HOW GOOD I AM.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.095
HEY. HI, ISABEL.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.231
SORRY, I... FUNNY STORY, I HOPE.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.167
I'M NOT ACTUALLY JOE'S
GIRLFRIEND OR HIS FIANCEE.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.436
HE WORKS FOR ME AND I
THOUGHT IF I CAME DOWN HERE

15:36.469 --> 15:38.205
AND TOLD PEOPLE WE
WERE A COUPLE THAT...

15:38.238 --> 15:41.241
LOOK THE POINT IS JOE'S
A GREAT GUY, YOU KNOW?

15:41.274 --> 15:44.111
HE'S HANDSOME AND
SMART AND FUNNY

15:44.144 --> 15:47.147
AND HE'S GONNA MAKE SOME
LUCKY LADY VERY HAPPY.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.150
YOU KNOW, THAT KISS BACK THERE
WAS AWFULLY CONVINCING.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.684
WHAT THAT? THAT KISS.
NO NO NO NO NO.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.553
THAT WAS OUR FIRST
AND LAST, OKAY?

15:53.586 --> 15:56.556
AND RIGHT AFTER WE'RE DONE TALKING,
I'M GONNA GO PURELL MY LIPS.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.326
COME ON, YOU TWO
OBVIOUSLY HIT IT OFF.

15:59.359 --> 16:02.029
WELL, WE WERE SORT OF CLICKING.

16:02.062 --> 16:05.065
GOOD. GO, CLICK SOME MORE.
CLICK YOUR ASSES OFF.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.202
UH, HI.

16:09.236 --> 16:13.506
- DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?
- I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.012
SO YOU HAVE A PRETTY NICE BOSS.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.714
OH, SHE'S NOT MY BOSS.

16:21.748 --> 16:26.086
TECHNICALLY SHE'S MY FRIEND.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.721
ACTUALLY I'M REALLY
MORE FREELANCE.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.990
AND I'M SORRY THAT
I DOUBTED YOU.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.559
I JUST REMEMBERED
THE OLD JOE LONGO,

16:32.592 --> 16:34.294
THE ONE WHO HAD GIRLS
FIGHTING OVER HIM.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.730
THAT GUY IS NOT ME.
THAT GUY IS LONG GONE.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.999
GET OUT OF MY WAY!
OUT OF MY WAY!

16:40.033 --> 16:43.436
- I'M MRS. JOE LONGO!
- ( music stops )

16:43.470 --> 16:47.240
JOE, HONEY, IT'S ME, YOUR
WIFE FROM OUR MARRIAGE.

16:47.274 --> 16:51.311
- STEPHANIE.
- STEPHANIE.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.581
- DON'T WORRY, BABY. MAMA'S HERE.
- I...

16:56.649 --> 16:59.452
AND TO THINK I
ALMOST MISSED THIS.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.495
WELL, WASN'T THAT EPIC? WE
HAD MORE PIZZAS THAN PEOPLE.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.130
THAT WAS NOT MY FAULT.

17:10.163 --> 17:13.366
I TWEETED A GREAT INVITE. LOOK,
IT WAS WITTY AND CLEVER.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.668
NOBODY CAME BECAUSE THEY
DIDN'T KNOW WHEN TO SHOW UP.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.605
YOU PUT THE PARTY TIME AS
QUESTION MARK TO QUESTION MARK.

17:18.638 --> 17:23.576
NO, THAT IS NOT WHY... OH YEAH.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.412
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
PROOFREAD THIS BEFORE?

17:25.445 --> 17:28.081
YOU DON'T PROOFREAD A TWEET.
IT'S 140 CHARACTERS.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.183
HOW DO YOU SCREW THAT UP?

17:30.217 --> 17:32.185
WELL, I GUESS WE'D
BETTER CLEAN UP.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.622
NO ONE WAS HERE TO MAKE A MESS.

17:35.655 --> 17:39.259
WE'RE A DISAPPOINTMENT
TO TEENAGERS EVERYWHERE.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.262
ALL RIGHT, I SENT
STEPHANIE HOME.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.331
THAT GIRL SERIOUSLY
NEEDS TO GET A LIFE.

17:44.364 --> 17:49.035
ALWAYS TRYING TO SAVE THE
DAY, COME TO THE RESCUE.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.103
WHAT?

17:50.137 --> 17:52.439
OKAY, I KNOW I CAN
BE OVERPROTECTIVE

17:52.472 --> 17:55.041
AND OVERINVOLVED
AND OVERDRAMATIC,

17:55.074 --> 17:58.445
BUT THAT'S ONLY
BECAUSE I OVER-CARE.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.647
WELL, YOU NEED TO
GET OVER YOURSELF.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.182
- I CAN TAKE CARE OF ME.
- OH?

18:02.215 --> 18:04.384
DID YOU GET ISABEL TO
GIVE YOU HER NUMBER?

18:04.417 --> 18:07.154
NO. AFTER STEPHANIE'S ONE-WOMAN
SHOW, I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.622
WELL THEN, I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
BE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

18:12.225 --> 18:16.263
- BY 10 FRO-YOS, GET THE 11th FREE?
- WHOOPS, WRONG CARD.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.698
HERE.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.268
- ISABEL RYAN? IS THIS HER PHONE NUMBER?
- YES, SIR. YEAH.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.669
I DON'T MESS EVERYTHING UP.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.472
I RAN INTO HER IN THE PARKING LOT,
TOLD HER WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.740
SHE SAID A STORY AS LAME
AS THAT HAS GOTTA BE TRUE.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.842
THANK YOU, BURKE, FOR REPAIRING

18:29.876 --> 18:31.711
ALMOST ALL THE
DAMAGE THAT YOU DID.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.747
YOU'RE WELCOME. I GUESS
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.651
Joe: OH GREAT.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.520
JUST WHEN MY NIGHT
WAS LOOKING UP,

18:40.553 --> 18:43.590
KYLE FREAKIN' COOKLER...

18:43.623 --> 18:45.725
YOU SEE THAT, MEL? A YEAR
AGO THAT WAS MY LIFE.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.727
I WAS THAT GUY.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.864
YEAH WELL, HE'S JUST
ANOTHER TALL, RICH,

18:51.898 --> 18:55.535
EXTREMELY HANDSOME LOSER.

18:55.568 --> 18:59.339
- COME ON, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
- NO, I CAN HANDLE IT.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.875
JOE LONGO, MIGHTY JOE LONGO.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.811
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE GRADUATION.

19:04.844 --> 19:08.348
A FEW THINGS HAVE CHANGED, HUH?
I READ THE PAPERS.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.882
YEAH, A LOT OF
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.784
- HOW'VE YOU BEEN, KYLE?
- ( ringing )

19:11.818 --> 19:14.287
OH, CAN YOU HOLD ON, JOE?
THIS IS BUSINESS.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.356
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

19:16.389 --> 19:19.125
YES, MR. DREXEL? WHAT?

19:19.158 --> 19:21.328
YES, OF COURSE. I CAN BE
AT THE OFFICE IN THE HOUR.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.463
NO, SIR, NOT A PROBLEM.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.833
YES, WITH THE ENTIRE
COST BREAKDOWN, BUT...

19:26.866 --> 19:29.336
SURE. NO NO.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.571
I AM NOT AT A PARTY.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.740
I'M ON MY WAY, SIR.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.376
LOOK, JOE, I GOTTA RUN.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.245
TAKE CARE, KYLE. WE'LL
SEE YOU AROUND.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.213
ALYSSA.

19:40.247 --> 19:43.483
REALLY? HERE?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.518
COME ON.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.359
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR
BUDDY HAS QUITE THE LIFE.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.593
YEAH.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.563
IS IT TERRIBLE I FEEL
SO GREAT ABOUT THAT?

19:56.596 --> 19:58.931
NOT AT ALL. YOU KNOW WHAT? I
WAS WRONG ABOUT REUNIONS.

19:58.965 --> 20:02.402
THAT RIGHT THERE...
TOTALLY WORTH YOU COMING.

20:02.435 --> 20:06.406
SO HOW DID YOUR DINNER
WITH THE FOIL GUY GO?

20:06.439 --> 20:08.308
OH MY GOD.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.876
HE'S IN A TAXI OUT FRONT!

20:28.495 --> 20:31.564
( locks click )

20:31.598 --> 20:33.800
BYE, GUSTAVO. THANK YOU.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.436
HEY, GIVE ME THAT TAXI RECEIPT.
I CAN DEDUCT IT.

20:36.469 --> 20:40.673
LENNOX, RYDER, WHAT
HAPPENED HERE?

20:40.707 --> 20:42.342
DID YOU GUYS HAVE A PARTY?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.544
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
IT IF WE TOLD YOU.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.945
WE INVITED EVERYONE FROM SCHOOL,

20:45.978 --> 20:47.914
BUT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE CONFUSION.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.750
THE CONFUSION WAS TWO
PEOPLE NOT LISTENING TO ME.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.885
UPSTAIRS. I'LL DEAL WITH
YOU TWO IN THE MORNING

20:52.919 --> 20:55.388
IF YOU WILL KINDLY REMIND ME.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.993
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THEY TOTALLY
JUST DIDN'T LISTEN TO YOU.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.863
YEAH. IT'S SO CUTE.
THEY'RE GROWING UP.

21:05.332 --> 21:08.301
- OH MAN.
- WHOO, WHAT A NIGHT.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.702
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.
BY THE WAY,

21:09.736 --> 21:11.538
WHEN YOU WENT IN FOR THAT
ATTACK KISS OF YOURS,

21:11.571 --> 21:12.872
I THINK YOU CHIPPED
MY FRONT TOOTH.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.574
WELL, I DIDN'T EXPECT
YOU TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.843
MY JAW WAS DROPPING IN SHOCK.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.445
GOD, YOU REALLY WENT FOR IT.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.646
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SELL IT.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.280
YEAH WELL, YOU WERE
PRETTY CONVINCING.

21:21.314 --> 21:22.582
I'M A GOOD SALESPERSON.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.750
NEXT TIME GIVE ME A
LITTLE WARNING, OKAY?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.352
WHAT DO YOU MEAN NEXT TIME?

21:25.385 --> 21:26.486
I DON'T MEAN NEXT
TIME, NEXT TIME.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.988
I MEAN... LOOK, JUST
DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

21:29.021 --> 21:31.324
( muffled ) HA, YOU
SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.330
( theme music playing )
