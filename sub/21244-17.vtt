00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:04.250 --> 00:06.330
Previously...

00:06.330 --> 00:08.120
I'm still kinda freaked out
about my mission last night.

00:08.120 --> 00:09.620
I actually thought that
I was gonna die,

00:09.620 --> 00:12.120
and it made me realize,
the one thing

00:12.120 --> 00:14.880
- that I'm missing
in my life is Darien.
- A manicure.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.750
- Wait, what? Darien?
- I still have
feelings for him.

00:16.750 --> 00:20.250
Then why are you
telling me this?
You should be telling him.

00:20.250 --> 00:22.460
Wow, you really don't
want anything to do
with me, do you?

00:22.460 --> 00:24.330
I can't help it,
but I do.

00:24.330 --> 00:26.040
I'm also scared.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.750
Maybe we can
take it slow.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.210
I'm cool with that.

00:29.210 --> 00:31.040
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:35.420 --> 00:38.330
Okay, Darien, are you meant
to be my boyfriend or not?

00:38.330 --> 00:40.290
Give me a signal.
Any signal.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.460
I am ready to respond.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.330
- What?
- Nothing.

00:45.330 --> 00:46.460
You were staring at me.

00:46.460 --> 00:49.170
I was not staring at you.

00:49.170 --> 00:50.880
I was staring at nothing.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.250
No, I'm not saying
you're nothing.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.250
I mean, you're
definitely something.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.670
I'm just saying that
I wasn't staring at you.

00:56.670 --> 00:59.290
I was staring past you,

00:59.290 --> 01:01.330
at the pinball machine.

01:01.330 --> 01:04.790
There's so many...
beautiful... colors.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.120
Can I ask you
a question?

01:08.120 --> 01:10.210
Yeah. Oh, sure.
Absolutely.

01:10.210 --> 01:12.790
Whatever you ask me,
I will probably say yes.

01:14.380 --> 01:16.330
I once fell asleep in class,

01:16.330 --> 01:18.620
and woke up in the middle
of a chess club meeting.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.620
Does that count as
an extracurricular activity?

01:20.620 --> 01:23.170
No, that counts
as narcolepsy.

01:24.330 --> 01:26.330
You might wanna
see a doctor about that.

01:26.330 --> 01:28.420
Why are you asking?

01:28.420 --> 01:30.500
Trying to beef up
my application to
Morehouse College.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.290
He doesn't have
the grades for that,

01:32.290 --> 01:34.960
and that's probably why
this isn't gonna work out.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.620
Wait, but if
you think about it,

01:37.620 --> 01:40.920
Morehouse, that's right next
to where I wanna go to school.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.330
Wait a minute,
that's a signal.

01:44.580 --> 01:46.250
Okay, Darien, look,

01:46.250 --> 01:48.580
I get it.

01:48.580 --> 01:49.580
You like me.

01:51.290 --> 01:53.710
- Excuse me?
- You're applying to go
to Morehouse,

01:53.710 --> 01:56.330
which is right next
to the school I wanna
go to, Spelman,

01:56.330 --> 01:58.960
and you want us to be
girlfriend and boyfriend,

01:58.960 --> 02:01.040
and you're clearly afraid
of long-distance relationships.

02:01.040 --> 02:04.290
I mean, I'm not stupid.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.920
Actually, I wanna go
to Morehouse

02:05.920 --> 02:08.710
because my father went there,
and my grandfather,

02:08.710 --> 02:10.830
and three of my uncles.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.120
Okay, maybe I'm
a little stupid.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.710
What's going on
with you, KC?

02:14.710 --> 02:16.790
Sorry.
I'm a little embarrassed.

02:16.790 --> 02:19.080
I just thought that you
were giving off signals

02:19.080 --> 02:21.290
that you wanted to be
a couple or something.

02:21.290 --> 02:22.250
I'm really bad at this.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.290
Maybe not as bad
as you think.

02:26.290 --> 02:30.120
Maybe we should give
the dating thing
another try.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.000
I'm sorry,
just to be clear,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.500
when you say that you
wanna give the dating
thing another try,

02:34.500 --> 02:36.250
you mean that we--

02:36.250 --> 02:39.880
We should give the dating
thing another try.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.830
- Cool.
- Cool.

02:41.830 --> 02:44.250
I knew he wanted
to be my boyfriend all along.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.380
I don't know
what I was worried about.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.620

good-for-nothing nincompoop.

03:48.380 --> 03:49.380
Now what?

03:49.380 --> 03:51.540
Mr. Vita failed me.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.500
I got an F in
creative writing.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.210
Like his writing
is any better.

03:55.210 --> 03:57.500
It's so bad that it...

03:57.500 --> 03:59.170
isn't good.

04:00.710 --> 04:04.210
Wow, hard to believe
you got an F.

04:04.210 --> 04:07.170
Let me see your paper.

04:07.170 --> 04:09.250
"There once was
a man who died

04:09.250 --> 04:11.540
because he was
carbon based."

04:13.830 --> 04:16.380
"The end."

04:16.380 --> 04:18.080
There is nothing
wrong with that.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.880
It's 100% factual.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.460
Yeah, but
it's not fun,
or creative.

04:22.460 --> 04:23.960
Who needs to be
creative?

04:23.960 --> 04:26.790
Humans need to be
creative to generate
new ideas.

04:26.790 --> 04:28.460
If someone hadn't said,

04:28.460 --> 04:31.290
"What if I build
a walking insult machine?"

04:31.290 --> 04:33.420
you wouldn't
even be here.

04:33.420 --> 04:36.040
And you wouldn't be here
if Agent Kira had just said,

04:36.040 --> 04:39.420
"I scored with KC.
Why don't I quit
while I'm ahead?"

04:45.830 --> 04:47.420
( knocking on door )

04:49.250 --> 04:50.880
Oh, hello, Darnell.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.420
It's Darien, Mr. Cooper.

04:52.420 --> 04:53.380
Hey, same thing.
Come on in.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.420
Far enough.

04:56.420 --> 04:58.330
I'm here to pick up
KC for our date.

04:58.330 --> 05:00.880
And you show up here
in jeans and a T-shirt?

05:00.880 --> 05:03.170
Haven't you ever heard of
the expression "dress to
impress"?

05:03.170 --> 05:05.250
We're going to
the baseball game.

05:05.250 --> 05:08.250
Huh. In that case,
cool duds.

05:10.460 --> 05:11.920
Now look here.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.960
I like you, son.
I always have.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.290
But if you break
my daughter's heart
one more time,

05:16.290 --> 05:18.080
I will break you.

05:18.080 --> 05:21.500
Mr. Cooper, actually,
she was the one
who broke my heart.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.330
And you came back
for more?

05:23.330 --> 05:25.040
What's wrong
with you, boy?

05:25.040 --> 05:27.210
Get some self-respect
and move on.

05:27.210 --> 05:29.460
Okay, what Mr. Cooper's
trying to say

05:29.460 --> 05:31.460
is have a nice time.

05:31.460 --> 05:34.380
But if KC's not home
by 11:00, you'll be
in jail by 12:00.

05:34.380 --> 05:36.250
- You ever been in jail, boy?
- I don't think he has.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.420
Hey, Mom, Dad.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.420
Hey, hey.

05:40.420 --> 05:43.120
I do not need you to
embarrass me in front
of my date.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.380
I can do that
all on my own.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.250
Yeah, let's go.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.170
BOTH: So cute!

05:56.170 --> 05:58.960
- Remember our first date?
- Of course I do.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.670
We took the train downtown,
and I forgot my jacket.

06:01.670 --> 06:05.250
I was a perfect gentleman
and lent you mine.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.830
We went to the arcade,
and we played air hockey.

06:07.830 --> 06:09.290
That's right.

06:09.290 --> 06:11.790
And I whupped
your butt.

06:11.790 --> 06:13.620
That's wrong.

06:13.620 --> 06:15.540
As I recall,
I beat you.

06:15.540 --> 06:18.120
Well, then, you're not
recalling very well,

06:18.120 --> 06:20.210
because the score
was eight to three.

06:20.210 --> 06:24.210
It was, only I had
eight, and you had three.

06:24.210 --> 06:26.380
Okay, this is silly,

06:26.380 --> 06:29.420
because the point is,
we had a great date.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.290
It was.
It was very great.

06:31.290 --> 06:34.750
Especially because
you were such a good
sport when I beat you!

06:34.750 --> 06:36.380
Ha! Now I know
you're lying,

06:36.380 --> 06:38.210
'cause I've never been
a good sport in my life.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.710
- These seats are
pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.

06:47.710 --> 06:48.920
Want some popcorn?

06:48.920 --> 06:50.750
Oh, I'm good.
Nachos.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.620
You know,
this is nice.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.920
Just the two of us,
chillin'...

06:54.920 --> 06:56.790
Hey, hey, I saw that, blue.

06:56.790 --> 06:58.580
Listen, I've seen potatoes
with better eyes.

06:58.580 --> 07:01.210
The strike zone
is chest to knees.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.210
That's right,
chest to knees.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.210
Sorry. I get
carried away.

07:09.210 --> 07:11.250
Doesn't bother me.

07:18.920 --> 07:24.000
CROWD: Kiss, kiss, kiss,
kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss...

07:35.210 --> 07:37.460
Sorry about that.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.790
I just ruined
our first kiss,
didn't I?

07:39.790 --> 07:43.500
Actually, you ruined
our first kiss last year.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.420
You just ruined
our second first kiss.

07:48.830 --> 07:52.380
BOTH: This date is not going
as well as I thought it would.

07:58.210 --> 08:01.670
Ugh! This creative writing
assignment is impossible.

08:01.670 --> 08:05.380
Okay, I'm gonna help you
get in touch with
your creative side

08:05.380 --> 08:08.210
- by doing some
improvisation.
- What's that?

08:08.210 --> 08:10.120
It's when you make up
characters and scenes

08:10.120 --> 08:12.380
right on the spot.
Let's give it a shot.

08:12.380 --> 08:14.420
You pretend
you're a teacher,

08:14.420 --> 08:16.960
and I'll pretend
I'm a new student.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.330
Hello. Are you my teacher?

08:19.330 --> 08:21.000
No.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.540
Judy, you have to say yes.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.960
The number one rule
in improv

08:25.960 --> 08:28.210
is always to say "yes and..."

08:28.210 --> 08:30.710
Now, let's try again.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.540
Hello. Are you my teacher?

08:32.540 --> 08:35.540
Yes and.

08:35.540 --> 08:39.380
You can't just say
"yes and."

08:39.380 --> 08:40.920
You have to add
words to it.

08:42.210 --> 08:44.250
Hello. Are you my teacher?

08:44.250 --> 08:47.380
Yes, and...
are we done?

08:49.750 --> 08:51.540
I can see we have
more work to do.

08:51.540 --> 08:54.540
Yes, and...
I hate this.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.420
Hey, Marisa, are you free
to talk for a second?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.420
I'm on a little break
from my date.

09:07.420 --> 09:09.380
Let me guess.

09:09.380 --> 09:12.290
You just went to the ladies
room to de-cheesify your face?

09:12.290 --> 09:14.670
How do you know that?

09:14.670 --> 09:17.420
They're playing your epic
kissing fail on TV.

09:17.420 --> 09:21.210
Now it's on the big screen.

09:21.210 --> 09:24.290
( laughing )
It's in slow motion.

09:25.210 --> 09:27.210
Are you serious?

09:27.210 --> 09:30.420
Sorry, KC,
I can barely hear you here

09:30.420 --> 09:31.880
over all the laughter.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.420
I'll have to call you
later. Bye.

09:34.420 --> 09:36.540
That's fine. I'm actually
really busy right now.

09:36.540 --> 09:38.210
I'm just dying
from embarrassment.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.670
You're not goin'
anywhere.

09:40.670 --> 09:43.250
Regina Honey, what
are you doing here?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.580
I was here watching the game,
and I saw your cheesy mug

09:46.580 --> 09:48.380
up on the big screen,
and thought to myself,

09:48.380 --> 09:50.460
this was the perfect
time for revenge.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.580
- My date--
- Is over.

09:52.580 --> 09:54.290
Technically, it was over

09:54.290 --> 09:57.330
with that sad, pathetic
attempt at kissing.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.290
You're already abducting me
at laser point.

09:59.290 --> 10:00.830
Do you really have
to be so mean about it?

10:00.830 --> 10:02.380
Go!

10:08.290 --> 10:09.460
Okay, so what's
your plan here?

10:09.460 --> 10:12.080
All I know is,
you ruined my life,

10:12.080 --> 10:14.540
and now, I'm gonna
ruin yours.

10:14.540 --> 10:15.830
How did I do that?

10:15.830 --> 10:17.420
By busting me.

10:17.420 --> 10:19.380
I spent the last two years
in prison because of you.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.290
Sorry, but when you threaten
to destroy the entire world,

10:22.290 --> 10:25.290
that's kinda my job
to stop you.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.290
We're like peanut butter
and jelly in that way.

10:29.290 --> 10:31.080
Apart,
two popular condiments.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.580
Together,
the number one sandwich

10:32.580 --> 10:34.790
in school cafeterias
across America.

10:34.790 --> 10:36.790
And lunch every day
in prison.

10:36.790 --> 10:38.170
By the way,

10:38.170 --> 10:41.880
I hate peanut butter
and jelly.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.540
( cell phone rings)

10:43.540 --> 10:45.710
Okay, that's
probably my date.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.380
Can I just pick up
and tell him I'm okay?

10:49.170 --> 10:50.420
Sorry.

10:52.170 --> 10:53.880
When you wanna do something,

10:53.880 --> 10:55.790
kinda my job to stop you.

10:57.420 --> 10:59.670
We're like peanut butter
and jelly that way.

10:59.670 --> 11:01.460
Right, peanut butter?

11:01.460 --> 11:03.710
Okay, listen, if one of us
is gonna be peanut butter,

11:03.710 --> 11:06.880
it's definitely you, 'cause
you're the one that's nuts.

11:10.290 --> 11:12.290
MARISA: You have reached
KC's phone.

11:12.290 --> 11:14.710
This is Marisa's
melodious voice

11:14.710 --> 11:16.750
leaving the outgoing message,
because KC's voice

11:16.750 --> 11:19.250
is bland and monotonous.
Leave a message.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.380
KC: Marisa, what are
you doing with my phone?

11:21.380 --> 11:23.080
( beep )

11:23.080 --> 11:24.460
Hey, it's me again.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.880
Where are you?

11:26.880 --> 11:29.120
I'm starting to get
a little worried.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.830
Call me.

11:32.880 --> 11:36.830
Okay, Judy, you've got
the hang of "yes and."

11:36.830 --> 11:39.170
So let's try to build
a full scene.

11:39.170 --> 11:41.920
It may seem intimidating,
but just remember,

11:41.920 --> 11:43.670
say whatever
pops in your head.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.170
You're a mouth breather.

11:46.170 --> 11:48.330
Okay, not that.

11:48.330 --> 11:50.250
I haven't even given you
a suggestion yet.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.460
Let's try an easy one.

11:52.460 --> 11:55.670
You be a doctor,
and I'll be a patient.

11:59.670 --> 12:03.290
Doc, I think there's
something wrong with me.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.120
Yeah. It's your brain.

12:07.540 --> 12:11.330
I'm diagnosing you with
a severe case of stupidity.

12:13.330 --> 12:15.000
You know, Judy,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.420
name calling is very
unprofessional for a doctor.

12:17.420 --> 12:20.330
New scene. We'll both
be firefighters.

12:22.170 --> 12:24.290
Whoa, this fire's
getting big.

12:24.290 --> 12:26.830
Yeah, you shouldn't
have lit it.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.040
But it's not your fault,

12:31.040 --> 12:34.790
because you were recently
diagnosed with a severe
case of stupidity.

12:34.790 --> 12:36.830
Can we please move
away from that?

12:36.830 --> 12:38.380
This is a different scene.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.290
Now help me
put out this fire.

12:40.290 --> 12:41.580
And be creative.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.330
Was that creative
enough for you?

12:51.290 --> 12:53.000
Okay, come on,
what's your plan?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.040
I don't know.

12:55.040 --> 12:59.420
I mean, it's not like
I thought this thing through.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.830
Really? 'Cause I figured
that two hours ago.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.830
It's not like I have
anywhere to go anyway.

13:05.830 --> 13:09.120
Darien probably hates me,
because he thinks

13:09.120 --> 13:11.210
I walked out on him
and don't like him anymore.

13:11.210 --> 13:13.620
I cannot believe
this is happening again.

13:13.620 --> 13:15.210
What do you mean, again?

13:15.210 --> 13:17.210
Darien and I
used to date.

13:17.210 --> 13:19.830
Everything was great,
like, really, really great,

13:19.830 --> 13:21.500
and then, spying
got in the way,

13:21.500 --> 13:23.380
and I had to
break up with him.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.210
Then I got
a second chance with him,

13:25.210 --> 13:28.000
and I promised myself that
I would not break his heart,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.290
but here I am, doing
the same thing all over again.

13:30.290 --> 13:32.290
( sighs )

13:32.290 --> 13:34.210
I don't know why
I'm telling you.

13:34.210 --> 13:36.040
It's not like you would
understand or even care.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.620
Are you crying?

13:39.620 --> 13:41.040
No.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.500
Maybe a little.

13:44.330 --> 13:48.210
Okay, 'cause I was
thinking about kicking
my way out of this,

13:48.210 --> 13:50.920
but, uh, I can't really
kick you if you're crying.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.710
His name was
Joey Damico.

13:55.710 --> 13:59.790
We started seeing each other
when we were about your age.

13:59.790 --> 14:04.420
He was so sweet and cute,

14:04.420 --> 14:08.210
and he was the first boy
in my grade who had
to shave every day.

14:10.290 --> 14:13.670
And he breathed through
his mouth like a little puppy.

14:13.670 --> 14:15.420
So what happened?

14:15.420 --> 14:17.540
I don't know.

14:17.540 --> 14:20.330
I guess I fell in
with the wrong crowd,

14:20.330 --> 14:22.670
and started committing
petty larcenies,

14:22.670 --> 14:24.710
and light racketeering,

14:24.710 --> 14:26.750
toppling a few
foreign governments.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.540
You know, the uzhe.

14:28.540 --> 14:32.210
Joey didn't want
any part of that.

14:32.210 --> 14:33.250
He moved on.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.330
I let my job
get in the way of love.

14:44.170 --> 14:47.120
Uh... I'm not really
complaining,

14:47.120 --> 14:49.170
but what are you doing?

14:49.170 --> 14:51.670
Go.
Be with Joey.

14:51.670 --> 14:53.500
Uh... Darien.
Whatever his name is.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.380
Okay.

14:55.380 --> 14:57.500
I just hope he's still
there waiting for me.

14:59.210 --> 15:01.290
Um, thank you,
by the way.

15:03.210 --> 15:05.670
Oh, I'm too late.

15:05.670 --> 15:08.080
Although in retrospect,
the empty parking lot

15:08.080 --> 15:10.420
should've been
the first tip-off.

15:17.830 --> 15:19.380
Craig, what's that?

15:19.380 --> 15:20.880
The truth!

15:22.290 --> 15:23.790
We are gonna
settle the score

15:23.790 --> 15:26.000
right here,
right now.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.380
Okay, let me
get this straight.

15:27.380 --> 15:30.620
You're so cheap,
you won't buy
name-brand soda,

15:30.620 --> 15:34.120
but you'll buy
an air hockey table
to settle a dispute?

15:34.120 --> 15:36.120
Because I'm tired
of drinking 6-Up
and Mountain Don't.

15:37.830 --> 15:39.420
It's on.

15:39.420 --> 15:41.330
Oh, baby.

15:41.330 --> 15:42.960
Oh, baby,
that's right.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.620
- Are you ready, Craig?
- Show me what you got.

15:44.620 --> 15:46.580
BOTH: Show me what you got.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.460
Come on, Craig.
What's happening?

15:48.460 --> 15:51.000
( chattering indistinctly )

15:51.000 --> 15:52.670
Whoo!

15:52.670 --> 15:55.000
Oh, yeah.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.830
Oh, yeah.
Come on, Craig,
let's go.

15:57.830 --> 16:00.210
- Ha ha.
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.290
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.880
Ooh! Ooh!
Watch out.

16:19.210 --> 16:22.330
All right, Craig.
Next goal wins.

16:22.330 --> 16:23.880
- Are ya ready?
- I'm ready.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.460
I don't think you're ready.

16:27.380 --> 16:28.290
I beat ya!

16:28.290 --> 16:30.040
In your face!

16:30.040 --> 16:32.460
I beat you like
I beat you 20 years ago.

16:32.460 --> 16:35.500
Ha ha! Now admit it, Craig.
Say I beat you.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.460
Yeah, you beat me.

16:37.460 --> 16:38.960
( laughing )

16:38.960 --> 16:40.960
Yeah, thank you
very much.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.880
Because I let you win.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.330
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
Best two out of three?

16:45.330 --> 16:47.620
Okay, it's on
like Donkey Kong.

16:47.620 --> 16:50.250
And as I recall,
I beat you at that as well.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.420
You never beat me
at no Donkey Kong.

16:52.420 --> 16:53.830
- Come on!
- Let's go.

16:56.290 --> 16:59.580
Marisa, it's over.

16:59.580 --> 17:02.080
Okay? I broke
his heart again,

17:02.080 --> 17:03.290
- and he hates me.
- Ow!

17:03.290 --> 17:05.210
Snap out of it, KC.

17:05.210 --> 17:07.420
I'm not gonna let you
give up this easily.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.790
All you have to do is
come up with a good reason
for why you left.

17:09.790 --> 17:12.250
Marisa, I tried, okay,
and nothing sounds believable.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.750
All good lies
are based in truth,

17:13.750 --> 17:16.040
so let's start with that.
You got up because...

17:16.040 --> 17:17.420
I went to
the ladies room.

17:17.420 --> 17:19.000
And that is where
you say you were.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.290
For six hours?

17:22.120 --> 17:23.920
That is disgusting.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.330
Exactly. Nobody asks
follow-up questions

17:26.330 --> 17:28.920
when the story
is that gross.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.380
Wait, what are you guys
talking about?

17:30.380 --> 17:32.000
We're trying to come up
with a good cover story

17:32.000 --> 17:33.380
for why KC left Darien
on their date.

17:33.380 --> 17:34.380
Okay, Judy, you ready?

17:34.380 --> 17:36.040
I am ready.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.500
Two people
at a ballgame,

17:37.500 --> 17:40.170
and one of them
disappears.
What happened?

17:40.170 --> 17:42.170
You were at
the baseball game,

17:42.170 --> 17:44.210
and you went to
the restroom to
fix your hair.

17:44.210 --> 17:48.000
While inside, there
was an earthquake

17:48.000 --> 17:50.380
that caused a pillar
to fall down,

17:50.380 --> 17:53.290
trapping you
inside the bathroom.

17:53.290 --> 17:57.210
So why didn't Darien
feel this earthquake?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.620
Because it was
a micro quake.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.750
Barely registered
on the Richter scale,

18:01.750 --> 18:04.380
but it was strong enough
to open up a sinkhole

18:04.380 --> 18:06.500
right under
the bathroom sink.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.210
And why wasn't this
on the news?

18:09.210 --> 18:12.620
Because the stadium
made sure of it.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.500
Oswald Moneypenny,
the new owner,

18:14.500 --> 18:16.250
was over-leveraged with
this real estate purchase,

18:16.250 --> 18:18.790
and called the publisher of
the newspaper, his cousin...

18:18.790 --> 18:21.080
Larrabee Moneypenny.

18:21.080 --> 18:24.420
Yes, and Larrabee Moneypenny,
who covered it up,

18:24.420 --> 18:28.250
because his cousin Oswald
had dirt on him

18:28.250 --> 18:30.250
from something that happened
to them when they were teenagers

18:30.250 --> 18:32.330
on a fishing expedition
that I will not go into.

18:34.290 --> 18:36.210
Boom.

18:36.210 --> 18:39.080
Improv.

18:39.080 --> 18:42.580
Well, I guess it's better
than saying I was on
the toilet for six hours.

18:47.710 --> 18:51.830
So that's why you
didn't hear about
the earthquake

18:51.830 --> 18:54.380
on the news,
because

18:54.380 --> 18:56.120
Mr. Moneypenny...
remember him...

18:56.120 --> 18:58.250
he called his cousin,

18:58.250 --> 19:01.210
and I'm not really
at liberty to say

19:01.210 --> 19:03.500
what happened on
that fishing expedition,

19:03.500 --> 19:06.250
but, uh, suffice to say,

19:06.250 --> 19:09.290
three went out,
two came back.

19:11.580 --> 19:14.540
Yeah, how dumb do
you think I am?

19:14.540 --> 19:16.080
Okay, fine.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.790
I was constipated
for six hours,

19:18.790 --> 19:21.290
and I shouldn't have
eaten all that cheese.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.500
KC, stop, all right?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.120
I know exactly where
you disappeared to.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.460
- You do?
- Yeah.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.120
It's 'cause
I tried to kiss you.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.460
What?

19:31.460 --> 19:33.500
I was the one who said
we should go slow,

19:33.500 --> 19:35.170
and I went too fast.

19:35.170 --> 19:38.420
Guess I got caught up by
the whole Kiss Cam thing.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.670
But that's no excuse.
I never should've done that.

19:42.210 --> 19:45.620
'Cause I don't even know
if this is right.

19:45.620 --> 19:47.540
Oh, thank goodness.

19:47.540 --> 19:50.330
Wait, excuse me.

19:50.330 --> 19:52.120
I am so glad
you said that,

19:52.120 --> 19:54.170
because, well,
honestly,

19:54.170 --> 19:56.920
I was feeling
that way, too.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.540
This is not
right, Darien,

19:58.540 --> 20:01.080
and I don't know,
I just didn't say anything,

20:01.080 --> 20:04.710
because last time,
I'm the one who
disappointed you.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.790
Honestly, I just think
we're better off as...

20:09.790 --> 20:11.420
BOTH: Friends.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.120
Yeah.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.500
- We cool?
- Yeah, we're cool.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.750
Uh, maybe we should...

20:17.750 --> 20:19.790
There we go.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.960
You know what? Sometimes,
things don't work out.

20:26.290 --> 20:28.330
But sometimes, they do.

20:33.380 --> 20:34.960
( knocking on door )

20:37.380 --> 20:38.960
Regina.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.960
It's me, Joey Damico.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.920
Joey!

20:42.920 --> 20:45.710
What are you
doing here?

20:45.710 --> 20:48.000
I came over because...

20:48.000 --> 20:50.170
after all these years,
I realized

20:50.170 --> 20:51.670
I still love you.

20:51.670 --> 20:53.960
Really? Wait.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.920
How did you find me?

20:57.250 --> 21:00.420
Some girl contacted me
and gave me your address.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.420
Said something about
peanut butter and jelly.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.380
Anyway, I thought
I'd come over

21:06.380 --> 21:08.170
and ask you if
you, you know,

21:08.170 --> 21:11.170
you wanna grab some coffee
