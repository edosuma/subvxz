WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:04.036
Kind of unique
on this car is we typically
don't do a restoration.

00:04.071 --> 00:06.372
We're skipping
the modification step.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.741
Heard that before.

00:08.776 --> 00:11.110
I haven't seen
any damage to it,
the car drives straight.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.645
It looks like to me
that the car was crashed
at one point.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.081
-You know--
-no, no, no. Not this one.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.683
A correct restoration,
if you will.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.118
We got to go this way.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.719
They just don't make them
like they used to.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.187
So you're saying
there's a chance.

00:24.425 --> 00:28.193
[kevin] oh, what
a great day to be alive.
Triple black corvette.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.929
-I like that.
-You're not supposed to do it
while you're driving.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.031
[dave] whee!

00:35.436 --> 00:39.605
[dave]<i> when I look</i>
<i> at a blank canvas,</i>
<i> I see endless possibilities.</i>

00:39.640 --> 00:43.709
<i> As the ideas come to mind,</i>
<i> the lines start to fall</i>
<i> into place.</i>

00:43.744 --> 00:46.779
<i> And before you know it,</i>
<i> we have a bitchin' ride.</i>

00:48.315 --> 00:50.749
<i> A bitchin' ride</i>
<i> has intense color.</i>

00:50.785 --> 00:52.284
[man] this is gorgeous.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.753
-[dave]<i> performance.</i>
-[man] it's fantastic.

00:54.789 --> 00:58.824
[dave]<i> stance. Wheels. Sound.</i>

00:58.859 --> 01:00.826
<i> There's one thing</i>
<i>that makes our cars stand out.</i>

01:00.861 --> 01:03.395
<i> Ours are bitchin' rides.</i>

01:03.431 --> 01:04.830
[kevin] that never gets old.

01:04.865 --> 01:05.898
[dave laughing]

01:09.737 --> 01:12.838
[dave]<i> today we have an actual</i>
<i> 1966 corvette,</i>

01:12.873 --> 01:15.307
four, 27 four speed
kick butt car.

01:15.342 --> 01:16.975
It's actually
in very good shape.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.848
<i> So the cool thing about</i>
<i> this particular car</i>
<i> is the owners of the cars</i>

01:22.883 --> 01:25.884
<i> are actually old friends</i>
<i> and old clients of ours,</i>
<i> but more importantly</i>

01:25.920 --> 01:29.021
<i> this car has a very special</i>
<i>place in both of their hearts.</i>

01:29.056 --> 01:31.090
<i> It was actually</i>
<i> a wedding gift.</i>

01:31.125 --> 01:35.394
So we get the opportunity
to freshen up this car,
make sure it's perfect,

01:35.429 --> 01:36.929
but not modify it.

01:36.964 --> 01:40.766
That's right, I said we're
gonna leave it stock. Weird.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.268
Well, you ain't wasting
any time, are you, dog?

01:43.304 --> 01:46.505
No. This one should be
pretty straightforward.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.908
I mean, the more and more
we tear this thing down,
it's a nice car.

01:49.944 --> 01:54.179
Yeah, well, you know I drove
this the other day before
they backed it into this spot.

01:54.215 --> 01:57.049
Car, I mean, everything,
the brakes feel good,

01:57.084 --> 01:59.785
the car's got plenty
of power, it's quiet,
there's no exhaust leaks.

01:59.820 --> 02:03.422
You know we talked about this,
I know that she wanted
air conditioning.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.291
-Yes.
-So what I do think
is gonna be the best

02:06.327 --> 02:09.728
-is let's do a factory style
air conditioning.
-That's... Exactly.

02:09.763 --> 02:13.065
So it doesn't take anything
away, we're not putting
modern stuff in it.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.969
We will have the original
air conditioning that it would
have maybe came with.

02:17.004 --> 02:19.438
-We're gonna
do electric wipers.
-Yes.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.840
-[kevin] electric headlights.
-Please.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.842
And then we'll just repaint it
and rebuild.

02:23.878 --> 02:26.879
That's it. Really the outward
appearance other than

02:26.914 --> 02:29.148
the paint looking
a little bit shabby.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.749
These tires are going
in the garbage.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.317
-[kevin] mmm-hmm.
-[dave chuckles]

02:32.353 --> 02:33.952
[dave] that's the only
thing that really
needs to be done.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.721
I'm going to have justin
look at the top,

02:35.756 --> 02:38.524
make sure that it can
come clean, it looks
like it's in great shape.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.592
So no point in changing it,

02:40.628 --> 02:43.662
if we have to change it,
I'm gonna talk them into
doing a black top.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.398
Okay. I don't think this
is going to be a problem,
I mean,

02:46.433 --> 02:48.600
I think that's the only
downfall of this car

02:48.636 --> 02:50.502
is like the lines just aren't
very sharp.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.271
-It's kind of soft.
-Right.

02:52.306 --> 02:55.073
So a nice new paint job
on this thing,
kind of rebuild everything,

02:55.109 --> 02:57.643
-make sure it's clean and
nice. It's gonna be money.
-Mmm-hmm.

02:57.678 --> 03:01.113
Yeah, I haven't seen
any damage to it,
the car drives straight.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.581
I mean everything
works really, really well.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.651
Every time you hit the key,
it fires right up so I mean,

03:05.686 --> 03:08.787
it's a solid car
and like I said,
minus the paint.

03:08.822 --> 03:12.824
Powder coat black
on the chassis just so
it's gonna last a lot longer.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.227
I think the car
has already had disk brake
conversion done.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.029
-That is correct.
-Which is fine.

03:17.064 --> 03:22.668
Because it stops
just perfectly. So, I want
to repaint the engine.

03:22.703 --> 03:26.171
Let's clean up and make
sure the transmission
is properly done.

03:26.207 --> 03:29.942
And let's strip all of the old
lacquer and paint off of it.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.110
Let's make sure there's
no stress cracks

03:32.146 --> 03:33.545
and we'll just bring
it back up from there.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.280
[kevin] I'll just sharpen
it up and I think
that we'll probably

03:35.316 --> 03:39.351
find some filler or something
that softens these up.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.020
-I think they'll come back
when we get it stripped.
-[dave] yeah.

03:42.056 --> 03:46.358
So that's kind of unique
on this car is we typically
don't do a restoration.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.993
It's like we're skipping
a whole step.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.127
It's a nice car.

03:49.163 --> 03:51.129
We're skipping
"the modification" step.

03:51.165 --> 03:52.798
-"I'm hip." cool.
-Okay.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.866
[dave]<i> cutting out</i>
<i> an entire step.</i>

03:54.902 --> 03:58.503
<i> Kevin, I'd say was pretty</i>
<i> optimistic about having</i>
<i> a restoration in the shop.</i>

03:58.539 --> 04:01.940
Now some of the other guys
might not feel the same way.

04:01.976 --> 04:05.477
-Restotion,
bitchin' or lame?
-Restorations suck.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.379
-Lame.
-It's bitchin'.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.548
-100% bitchin'.
-Lame.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.450
-Bitchin' all the way.
-Custom.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.185
Hot rod all the way.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.720
Why would you ever
want to recreate it?

04:14.755 --> 04:17.122
Restorations all the way.
Making it...

04:17.157 --> 04:18.757
Is pringle making funny faces
behind me?

04:18.792 --> 04:20.125
Yeah.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.028
-Why?
-Full custom. That's where
the true artists are.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.931
Either go all out,
or put it back to stock.

04:25.966 --> 04:30.202
Restorations are bitchin'
but resto mod
is where it's at.

04:30.237 --> 04:33.372
I'd like to see it in a museum
like once, maybe.

04:33.407 --> 04:36.808
Every day, day in
and day out. No way.

04:36.844 --> 04:40.145
-[dave]<i> whether you love</i>
<i> restorations or full customs.</i>
-Restorations are lame.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.913
You know, there's an ass
for every seat.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.984
But I can say for sure
that this one
is gonna be bitchin'.

04:48.255 --> 04:52.291
[kevin]<i> so on this corvette,</i>
<i> we're not getting crazy</i>
<i> with any of these panels,</i>

04:52.326 --> 04:54.993
we're not putting a kick ass
chassis under this thing,

04:55.029 --> 04:56.962
<i> we are just</i>
<i> going to restore this car.</i>

04:56.997 --> 04:59.731
<i> But with every car here</i>
<i> at kindig-it design,</i>
<i> starts with a tear down.</i>

04:59.767 --> 05:02.301
It's actually a really
clean car for what it is.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.603
[kevin]<i> so the tricky part</i>
<i> about these tear downs,</i>

05:04.638 --> 05:07.839
especially on these
restorations is you have
to be super careful

05:07.875 --> 05:10.542
<i> with all of the parts</i>
<i> because you don't know</i>
<i> what you can get,</i>

05:10.577 --> 05:12.878
<i> you don't know</i>
<i> what you need to save.</i>

05:12.913 --> 05:16.581
We're trying to retain
as many parts as we possibly
can on this thing.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.518
So we're just trying to be
really careful. But we
also have to weigh it out.

05:19.553 --> 05:24.089
<i> If it costs a ton to restore</i>
<i> the part versus buying it,</i>

05:24.124 --> 05:26.525
<i> we was probably going</i>
<i>to just buy it because we want</i>
<i> to try to keep the cost down</i>

05:26.560 --> 05:28.960
<i> on the car. But at the same</i>
<i>time, the big important parts,</i>

05:28.996 --> 05:32.030
engine trans,
really cool trim,
we want to save

05:32.066 --> 05:34.700
because it just don't make
them like they used to.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.268
<i> And it's going to go back</i>

05:37.604 --> 05:39.838
90% of its
original parts. So,

05:39.873 --> 05:44.643
if anything we did any
different it was just
making sure we cataloged

05:44.678 --> 05:47.746
all of the original parts
because that's what's
going to go back on it.

05:47.781 --> 05:51.717
So usually we send
the cars out to dip but this
one we sending out to blast

05:51.752 --> 05:54.820
because that dip stuff
that they dip it in,

05:54.855 --> 05:57.522
the fiberglass will be gone.
Are we good
on that side, ira?

05:57.558 --> 05:59.991
-[ira] yeah, we're good.
-[kevin] perfect.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.327
-That'll work. Yep.
-[ira] right there?

06:02.363 --> 06:03.695
Thank you guys
so much.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.638
[dave]<i> with the car out</i>
<i> to media blast, now it's time</i>
<i> to go through and categorize</i>

06:13.674 --> 06:17.142
<i> everything that needs</i>
<i> to either get refinished,</i>
<i> redipped,</i>

06:17.177 --> 06:19.711
<i> or especially this trim,</i>
<i> it's important that we use</i>

06:19.747 --> 06:21.446
<i> as much of the original trim</i>
<i> as possible.</i>

06:21.482 --> 06:25.717
This is gonna entail us
calling up the trim whisper.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.821
[upbeat music playing]

06:37.831 --> 06:40.832
right now, I'm trying
to get rid of all
the little impressions

06:40.868 --> 06:43.034
and dings and whatnot.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.104
This is all the original trim,
basically saving it.

06:46.140 --> 06:49.474
It will look better once
it gets polished.

06:49.510 --> 06:53.645
You got to be gentle with it
because you can go way
too far, way too fast,

06:53.680 --> 06:56.982
in no time whatsoever.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.551
<i> So basically, these are all</i>
<i> made out of stainless steel,</i>

06:59.586 --> 07:03.155
<i> sometimes there's some out</i>
<i>of aluminum, you can polish it</i>
<i> and it won't rust.</i>

07:03.190 --> 07:06.324
<i> That's why they use it</i>
<i> for the trim and bright work</i>
<i> and whatnot.</i>

07:06.360 --> 07:09.361
A lot of time, we'll chrome
them but not this car.

07:09.396 --> 07:12.831
This one we're gonna keep it
all nice and original.

07:12.866 --> 07:16.301
Because of the shape of all
the different kinds of trim
and everything there is,

07:16.336 --> 07:19.971
you kind of need to have
different assortment of tools,

07:20.007 --> 07:23.442
whatnot, I've got a lot
of jewelry tools

07:23.477 --> 07:27.279
to try and help tap out all
the little areas and whatnot.

07:27.314 --> 07:30.749
I got kind of a rather
semi large assortment.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.019
Get more as I need to go,
a lot of times you have
to make them.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.490
<i> It's kind of like doing</i>
<i> bodywork,</i>

07:38.525 --> 07:41.726
<i> shaping metal, but obviously,</i>
<i> a little different.</i>

07:41.762 --> 07:43.528
For the age of the car,

07:43.564 --> 07:47.332
the trim's in a lot better
shape than others I've seen

07:47.367 --> 07:50.602
and had to work on.
So it shouldn't be too bad.

07:50.637 --> 07:54.473
I'm getting pretty close
to being done. You can see
those spots almost gone now.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.242
It's pretty much gone.
I just I get rid
of the scratches.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.044
And to do this
you have to have patience.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.014
Since I have patience,
I get stuck doing it.

08:05.319 --> 08:09.421
Every time I see pringle
doing some trim restoration,
I have to stop by

08:09.456 --> 08:11.957
just to see how he's doing.
To see if he needs some help.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.227
<i> But most importantly,</i>
<i> make sure he's having fun.</i>

08:15.262 --> 08:16.795
[kevin laughs]

08:16.830 --> 08:19.564
it's not bad,
I don't mind it.
It's kind of fun.

08:37.317 --> 08:40.752
[kevin]<i> well, I know dave</i>
<i> is super excited to get</i>
<i> this restoration done,</i>

08:40.787 --> 08:43.021
so we got it all
stripped down,
I got the car to the blast,

08:43.056 --> 08:45.090
I just picked it up,

08:45.125 --> 08:46.958
I gotta let dave in
on some news.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.166
It's kind of cool to get a car
that we're just gonna not
like go all nuts on.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.501
Here it is.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.371
No, it doesn't look bad.

08:59.406 --> 09:04.809
It's 80% good, 20% bad.
This is the good side.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.746
-Is it really is that bad?
-Yeah, but basically, so

09:07.781 --> 09:10.415
it looks like to me
that the car was crashed
at one point.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.791
[dave]<i> our '66 corvette</i>
<i> is finally back</i>
<i> from soda blast</i>

09:19.826 --> 09:22.694
<i> and now we can</i>
<i> check and make sure</i>
<i> there's no damage.</i>

09:22.729 --> 09:25.931
If there is any damage
to the fiberglass,
we'll make some good repairs

09:25.966 --> 09:30.669
and then get on
with the program, but so far
this car looks pretty clean.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.638
It's kind of cool to get a car
that we're just gonna not like
go all nuts on.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.073
Here it is.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.776
No, it doesn't look bad.

09:37.811 --> 09:43.214
It's 80% good, 20% bad.
This is the good side.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.351
-Is it really is that bad?
-Yeah, but basically, so

09:46.386 --> 09:47.953
it's really good.
We got it back.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.888
It's on all new bushings
on the frame.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.289
All the doors are hung.

09:51.325 --> 09:53.792
Yeah, it looks like gaps look
pretty decent, really, I mean.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.528
So you get a little bit
of body filler there, so

09:56.563 --> 09:59.130
it looks like to me
that the car was crashed
at one point.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.900
On this side.
We got two new panels--

10:01.935 --> 10:04.235
[dave] it's got a crack
right here too. Yep,
on that header panel.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.439
[kevin] we got two new panels,
you know some kind of,

10:07.474 --> 10:12.577
kind of sub-par work down
there but like I said,
it's 20%.

10:12.613 --> 10:16.348
-I think that's
more like 17%.
-Okay.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.350
-I mean, we're under 20%.
-Okay, dave.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.218
-We're in great shape.
-Okay, dave.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.686
And these are all
original panels,

10:21.722 --> 10:23.755
obviously, this has been
replaced at some point.

10:23.790 --> 10:28.259
Probably a very early repair
but all in all, I mean,
the back's good too?

10:28.295 --> 10:31.296
The back's totally good.
There's no other panels
that have been replaced

10:31.331 --> 10:32.764
except for these two
right here.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.133
I can actually see this
car getting done very quickly.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.769
Yeah, that's real life, dave.
This is a great car.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.606
So what's next,
what do you wanna do?

10:41.642 --> 10:44.909
All right, so we'll work on
just the repairs, you know
we got a couple holes.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.478
I don't think we need
to order any panels.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.946
[dave] I really
wouldn't either.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.483
And we'll get this thing
in vinyl ester and
they'll start the bodywork.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.485
This is pretty crazy really.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.121
I'm trying to think
of the last time that we
restored something.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.523
-It was the futurliner.
-Right.

10:58.558 --> 11:02.193
Aside from that we typically
don't do, what we're going
to do to this car

11:02.229 --> 11:05.030
-and that's actually put
it all back to...
-The way we got it.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.899
-The way it came in. Stock.
-Just shinier.

11:07.934 --> 11:11.536
So the guys have
the engine going,
they tearing that thing down

11:11.571 --> 11:14.839
so we'll have it all prepped,
all sealed back up,
obviously, we'll repaint it.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.209
And the trans I believe
is just a natural thinness,
but we'll check.

11:18.245 --> 11:21.312
Housing gets painted,
natural finish
on the housing.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.847
We will recondition
the whole frame

11:22.883 --> 11:25.216
and have it powder coated
and then we should be
good to go.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.218
-Far out.
-It's just easy-peasy
on this one.

11:27.254 --> 11:31.256
-[whoops]
-don't add anything.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.258
-You know--
-no, no, no, not this one.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.694
Let's go talk
about another one.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.997
-It needs air conditioning.
-We maybe can talk
about air conditioning later.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.533
And maybe we'll get rid
of that california
emissions pump.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.568
Yeah. Okay, come on,
come on, come on.

11:43.603 --> 11:44.969
[dave] we can lower it though.
We can lower it.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.104
[both laughing]

11:53.346 --> 11:55.246
[kevin]<i> yes,</i>
<i> it is a restoration.</i>

11:55.282 --> 11:59.217
<i> But I still have all the guys</i>
<i> sanding every square</i>
<i> of this thing.</i>

11:59.252 --> 12:03.121
Making it laser straight,
making sure the gaps
are dialed,

12:03.156 --> 12:06.157
and we're gonna put
a kindig-it paint job on this
even if it is a restoration.

12:08.695 --> 12:12.964
Well, we're taking care
of any major deviations

12:12.999 --> 12:16.468
in the body with fiberglass
with fiberglass filler.

12:16.503 --> 12:21.272
I had to add quite a bit here
to match the surface
of the hood.

12:21.308 --> 12:26.678
Just taking care of the area
in between where I added
fiberglass and the original.

12:26.713 --> 12:29.080
Skinned it close before we go
into our first primer

12:29.116 --> 12:31.683
so we have less work
to do afterwards.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.452
It's nice not having
to go full on fabrication
on one of these,

12:34.488 --> 12:35.720
keep it more original.

12:42.729 --> 12:47.432
This is called hugger orange.
This is the standard
orange color used on

12:47.467 --> 12:50.769
most early gm muscle cars,
v8s and stuff.

12:52.639 --> 12:57.008
Get in there
and get these parts
for this '66 vette painted.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.644
<i> I'm a ford guy.</i>
<i> I like ford blue.</i>

12:59.679 --> 13:02.847
But gm decided to use orange,
so here we go.

13:09.823 --> 13:13.558
In true good fashion,
kindig-it design is now
in the restoration business.

13:13.593 --> 13:17.529
Well, at least for this car.
And in that case, the engine
is going hugger orange

13:17.564 --> 13:21.299
<i> just like original.</i>
<i> And this will look great</i>
<i> with a black exterior.</i>

13:21.334 --> 13:25.370
It turned out great.
Definitely orange.

13:25.405 --> 13:30.375
For what it is, it gives
it that authentic look,
I would say.

13:30.410 --> 13:35.046
Back in the '60s, if you
had a v8 from chevrolet,
it was likely hugger orange.

13:35.081 --> 13:40.051
Take it over to the assembly
side, we'll let them put it
back together.

13:40.086 --> 13:43.788
They'll slide back in the
car once we get the car
bumped up.

13:43.824 --> 13:47.525
[frank]<i> '66 corvette,</i>
<i> it's a cool car, it's the</i>
<i> first year for the 427</i>

13:47.561 --> 13:52.163
that chevy introduced, I think
this is a 11-to-1 compression
motor on this one.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.399
So it's you know,
a lightweight car
450 horsepower,

13:54.434 --> 13:55.934
<i> independent rear suspension.</i>

13:55.969 --> 13:58.770
<i> It's a restoration, we're not</i>
<i> doing anything exotic</i>
<i> with this one</i>

13:58.805 --> 14:01.172
<i> which is cool, so it's a body</i>
<i> and five other parts</i>

14:01.208 --> 14:03.508
that I've primed
so far instead of c10,

14:03.543 --> 14:06.678
which has got like 700 parts
scattered around the shop.

14:06.713 --> 14:10.215
<i> So we're spraying vinyl ester</i>
<i> on the '66 corvette today.</i>

14:10.250 --> 14:12.917
<i> The reason why we do this,</i>
<i> it's a high-build primer,</i>

14:12.953 --> 14:15.920
<i> it's kind of the same</i>
<i> as like a poly primer that we</i>
<i> would do on a metal car.</i>

14:15.956 --> 14:18.489
<i> Being that this</i>
<i> is fiberglass, we don't need</i>
<i> to do an epoxy primer</i>

14:18.525 --> 14:22.060
<i> to lock in and save metal</i>
<i> from rusting because there</i>
<i> is none. Makes it easier.</i>

14:22.095 --> 14:25.330
<i> Just pack it nice and thick,</i>
<i> this way we can</i>
<i> actually pump through after</i>

14:25.365 --> 14:28.900
<i>and block out the body and not</i>
<i> have to worry about doing</i>
<i> too much filler after that.</i>

14:28.935 --> 14:31.603
<i> So it's already been</i>
<i> straightened out</i>
<i> pretty well before here.</i>

14:31.638 --> 14:34.372
<i> This is just gonna get</i>
<i> those minor imperfections,</i>
<i> you know the fiberglass</i>

14:34.407 --> 14:36.908
<i> leaves little marks</i>
<i> with strands in it</i>
<i> when you sand it.</i>

14:36.943 --> 14:40.111
<i> So this will fill all</i>
<i> that up. And then after</i>
<i> this essentially we should be</i>

14:40.146 --> 14:43.481
pretty much good to go,
blocking it out, little things
here and there

14:43.516 --> 14:48.152
and get this thing sealed up
and actually painted. So yeah,
we'll shoot this stuff down,

14:48.188 --> 14:51.189
<i> lay five coats, get a nice</i>
<i> and thick, pull it out</i>
<i> of here and block it out.</i>

14:53.526 --> 14:55.526
So the car's primed,
looks like it came out
really good.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.630
Right now we'll just get
the booth up the temperature
and get this thing baking.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.365
Right on.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.933
Turn.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.801
[kevin]<i> to finish</i>
<i> the paint job.</i>

15:03.837 --> 15:06.671
<i> We're gonna go ahead</i>
<i> and split this car apart</i>
<i> from the chassis,</i>

15:06.706 --> 15:09.874
<i> this does a couple of things</i>
<i> for us, we can finish</i>
<i> the paint job,</i>

15:09.910 --> 15:11.643
we can powder coat
the chassis,

15:11.678 --> 15:14.512
we can take care
of a couple of problem spots
on the bottom of the car,

15:14.547 --> 15:16.314
get everything prepped
and when everything
looks good,

15:16.349 --> 15:17.916
we're going to put them
both together.

15:17.951 --> 15:21.419
[jason]<i> so we had this</i>
<i> corvette come over.</i>
<i> We're gonna split it apart.</i>

15:21.454 --> 15:23.988
This is just bone stock build
from what I understand.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.357
We haven't really done
anything to it over here.

15:26.393 --> 15:30.295
So we're just gonna brace
the center a little bit just
because it's a convertible

15:30.330 --> 15:32.764
<i> so it doesn't move too much</i>
<i> on the rotisserie,</i>

15:32.799 --> 15:34.332
and then split it,
get it mounted.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.968
I'm pretty confident
this one's gonna be easy.

15:39.072 --> 15:42.173
Yeah, we're gonna brace
this thing up pretty
rudimentary though,

15:42.208 --> 15:43.641
we're not going
to get too crazy.

15:43.677 --> 15:46.844
[jason] just a little
left and right,
front and back action.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.313
Mind your fingers.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.686
It's stronger than
the fiberglass,
that's for sure.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.529
[dave]<i> now that the body</i>
<i> work's pretty much finished</i>
<i> up, jason and his team</i>

16:04.564 --> 16:07.265
are now going to get the car
over to the metal shop
and get a separated

16:07.300 --> 16:09.133
from the chassis and put it on
the rotisserie.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.668
[jason] that's good.

16:10.704 --> 16:13.905
-What are we doing
to this thing?
-Paint job, that's it.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.708
-As far as I know.
-I've heard that before.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.480
[kevin]<i> this will be</i>
<i> the easiest thing</i>
<i> that we do all day.</i>

16:22.515 --> 16:24.615
We don't
have any modifications.

16:24.651 --> 16:28.219
There's no panels, there's
no flanges, the body should
just come right off.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.595
Those ones got a nut
on them.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.105
[jason] yahtzee!

16:48.108 --> 16:49.140
Get it.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.946
All right, now go up
about four inches.

16:54.981 --> 16:55.947
Let's just go up real slow.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.854
[jason] any cracking?

17:02.889 --> 17:04.088
[eric] looking good over here.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.494
[jason] I'm clear.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.134
Easy, man.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.636
It's only three o'clock,
we'll be done
before we go home.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.839
-Most def.
-[laughs]

17:21.875 --> 17:24.575
now we're gonna roll
the rotisserie under,
mount it up and be done.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.553
Cool, thanks.

17:35.588 --> 17:42.093
We gotta get all these
little extension arms
hanging from the car.

17:42.128 --> 17:46.130
<i> And then we're gonna</i>
<i> lower the car down</i>
<i> to the rotisserie,</i>

17:46.166 --> 17:49.267
<i> and then weld it</i>
<i> to the rotisserie,</i>
<i> tighten them down</i>

17:49.302 --> 17:51.135
and balance it,
and call it good.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.639
<i> Shoot it</i>
<i> pretty straightforward.</i>

17:54.674 --> 17:56.474
[upbeat music playing]

18:12.459 --> 18:15.460
at least halfway.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.396
To distribute
the weight or whatever
so it swings really nice.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.631
We're gonna bring it up
so we can

18:22.035 --> 18:23.668
move it mo' better.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.107
It feels better already.

18:31.010 --> 18:34.212
I think we gotta go up
a little more still,
it's better, but...

18:34.247 --> 18:35.813
Probably another four inches.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.186
Yeah, that feels
really good.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.125
Yeah, let's call it there,
tighten them all up.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.461
I like it.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.598
[kevin]<i> with the</i>
<i> bodywork complete</i>
<i>and the car on the rotisserie,</i>

18:53.633 --> 18:57.068
<i>the car is headed back over so</i>
<i>they can take care of a couple</i>
<i> spots on the bottom</i>

18:57.103 --> 18:59.971
and paint the entire car
black hole black.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.640
Record time.
Same day delivery.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.108
Let's go home.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.450
[kevin]<i> so we're not usually</i>
<i> in this situation a lot.</i>

19:12.485 --> 19:15.253
-[dave]<i> I know--</i>
<i>-what do we do with the bottom</i>
<i> of the car?</i>

19:15.288 --> 19:17.889
Because normally we would
bodywork it and smooth it out

19:17.924 --> 19:19.357
and paint it
and make it perfect.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.260
Well, we're doing
a restoration on this one.
So I was a little tossed

19:22.295 --> 19:24.829
and actually,
I've talked to a bunch
of corvette "gurus."

19:24.864 --> 19:29.433
the correct way to do it
is to leave it in the beige
looking fiberglass.

19:29.469 --> 19:33.571
So we're keeping it pretty
well close to the original,
but we're over restoring it.

19:33.606 --> 19:37.375
The body is perfected.
There's absolutely no reason
to do anything more

19:37.410 --> 19:39.577
-than what's already there.
-It's really solid, too.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.546
-It's actually
a really nice car.
-Really nice.

19:41.581 --> 19:45.416
[dave]<i> so cars</i>
<i> from the late '60s</i>
<i> aren't really that old.</i>

19:45.451 --> 19:49.654
I mean, the car, yes, is old,
and it's just barely any older
than I am.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.788
Right?

19:53.092 --> 19:55.226
-'66.
-Yeah.

19:57.697 --> 20:01.732
Okay, I was born in '71,
that's five years earlier than
'66, so let's just do math.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.834
You're right.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.237
-I'll be 50 next year.
-You're gonna be 60.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.805
Shut the front door.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.909
Let's just embrace it.
Look at this great car.
This is a great car, right?

20:11.945 --> 20:15.613
It's in great shape.
As old as it is,
it's in really great shape.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.516
It's got a couple of fractures
and a little bits been
replaced.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.985
So don't get down
on yourself because you're 60.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.787
But it's still
all original parts.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.823
-You know what, you're right.
-Yeah. You good, dude.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.758
-[dave mumbles]
-[kevin laughs]

20:27.794 --> 20:28.626
[dave] all right.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.664
Oh, god.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.699
[kevin laughs]

20:39.205 --> 20:43.074
so this is a stock '66
corvette chassis.

20:43.109 --> 20:45.576
The body is on the rotisserie
now in final paint.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.578
We got this over here,
we're going to get it all,

20:47.614 --> 20:50.548
obviously the chassis
stripped down,
ready to go to powder.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.718
We're doing this because he
really loves this car.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.787
I think they drove
this car on their honeymoon,
I believe.

20:56.823 --> 21:01.158
We're gonna go through
the parts and see what I can
powder and what I can't.

21:01.194 --> 21:04.328
And we'll get it all out,
and when it comes back,
it'll be beautiful.

21:07.267 --> 21:11.936
All the parts, panels, frames
need to be disassembled
and brought back to life.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.904
Spindles and hubs.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.474
A lot of the stuff's
not in bad shape.

21:16.509 --> 21:19.677
It would be way easier
for me to just take
this car apart,

21:19.712 --> 21:22.480
throw the parts
that don't look the greatest
in the garbage.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.316
<i> But this is a restoration,</i>
<i> we want to keep as many</i>
<i> original parts</i>

21:25.351 --> 21:28.052
<i> on this car</i>
<i> as we possibly can.</i>

21:30.790 --> 21:34.025
So, yeah,
we're gonna clean that,
we won't paint that.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.926
See, like these can go.

21:41.334 --> 21:44.869
<i>Saving and reusing these parts</i>
<i> on these restorations</i>
<i> can be a bear.</i>

21:44.904 --> 21:47.772
<i> You know, all the seals,</i>
<i> all the rubber,</i>
<i> all these crusty bearings,</i>

21:47.807 --> 21:49.373
<i> they gotta go.</i>

21:49.409 --> 21:52.343
These are the kinds of
things that make restorations
a little bit difficult.

21:52.378 --> 21:53.811
You got to decide,
what's got to go,

21:53.846 --> 21:55.880
<i> and what can stay.</i>

21:55.915 --> 21:56.981
This thing won't budge.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.083
[bleep]

22:04.891 --> 22:06.991
damn,
this thing's not coming out.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.495
There we go. Finally.

22:11.531 --> 22:15.399
I haven't had this much
trouble since I tried to get
out of the womb.

22:15.435 --> 22:18.969
<i> This '66 corvettes</i>
<i> been stripped down,</i>
<i> re-body-worked,</i>

22:19.005 --> 22:20.905
and is better than new.
And now it is finally
ready to paint.

22:23.843 --> 22:27.211
[dave]<i> so this car originally</i>
<i> was black with black interior</i>
<i> and a white top.</i>

22:27.246 --> 22:29.980
<i> And of course, all of these</i>
<i> cars had an orange engine.</i>

22:30.016 --> 22:33.150
So we're gonna
go back to the original
except for one thing,

22:33.186 --> 22:35.519
we're gonna
go black on the top,
triple black it is.

22:43.129 --> 22:46.797
No, that's from all
the bondo and
primer and

22:46.833 --> 22:49.066
a little bit of everything,
probably time for a new one.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.202
[chuckles]

22:52.905 --> 22:56.440
connector and then
we'll throw
in some slow reducer.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.976
It should be good to stir up
and lay out.

23:00.546 --> 23:01.946
Now we get to mix.

23:07.954 --> 23:10.321
[dave]<i> the original black</i>
<i> has a little bit</i>
<i> of a brown hue to it,</i>

23:10.356 --> 23:13.257
whereas my black
is a little bit more
on the blue side

23:13.292 --> 23:17.294
which makes it deeper,
darker, and colder and that is
so much more preferred,

23:17.330 --> 23:18.963
<i>especially on a car like this.</i>

23:18.998 --> 23:20.765
[brian] add some mixer.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.367
Basically,
everything's just going black.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.102
Gloss black up top.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.671
And then a satin black
underneath.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.774
Pretty straightforward.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.676
Put some paint
in some spray cups
and load it in the gun,

23:32.712 --> 23:35.112
I'll suit up
and get ready to lay
some color down.

23:41.287 --> 23:44.422
<i> Coverage would be</i>
<i> number one for me, obviously,</i>
<i> how it looks at the end,</i>

23:44.457 --> 23:46.524
<i> but coverage</i>
<i> is also a big thing.</i>

23:46.559 --> 23:49.894
<i> You should get away</i>
<i> with two coats and then go</i>
<i> in and kind of do</i>

23:49.929 --> 23:53.130
<i> some denibbing and then one</i>
<i>good coverage coat after that.</i>

24:03.576 --> 24:06.277
It's going good,
it's going down real nice.

24:06.312 --> 24:09.713
We'll get this rotisserie
turned and get the top
of it sprayed

24:09.749 --> 24:12.082
and let it flash,
and come into our second coat.

24:15.388 --> 24:17.388
[upbeat rock music playing]

24:36.175 --> 24:40.911
just doing a quick
denib before my next
coat of base.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.414
The black, it gets pretty
dirty. So...

24:43.449 --> 24:46.684
Go on ahead and kind of
toughen up most
of the cars

24:46.719 --> 24:48.986
to get the big dirt nibs
knocked down.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.258
All we have to do,
after the next coat, seal it,

24:54.293 --> 24:56.327
and then go ahead
and do the final phase.

24:56.362 --> 24:57.394
<i> We'll get the clear.</i>

25:00.766 --> 25:04.001
People don't realize how much
I appreciate a good paint job.

25:04.036 --> 25:07.371
<i> It's not about the actual</i>
<i> paint itself that I get</i>
<i> excited about,</i>

25:07.406 --> 25:09.974
<i> it's about what comes</i>
<i> after that.</i>

25:10.009 --> 25:13.644
The chassis's back. Mmm!

25:13.679 --> 25:17.448
Even though this is a stock
chassis, I'm super excited
to put it all together,

25:17.483 --> 25:18.816
<i> and stand back and look</i>
<i> at this sexy chassis.</i>

25:20.786 --> 25:23.621
Everybody knows kevin's
a sucker for old chassis.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.290
And for him, this one's like
a fine wine.

25:26.325 --> 25:29.560
This is the 1966 corvette
chassis.

25:29.595 --> 25:31.896
And this is kind of more
of a restored build.

25:31.931 --> 25:35.966
We still have a kindig-it
quality here, we want it to be
as nice as it possibly can be.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.902
But we're not polishing
anything,

25:37.937 --> 25:40.871
we're not changing hardware,
so it looks the same.

25:40.907 --> 25:44.275
We're basically putting
everything back just
the way it came.

25:44.310 --> 25:48.178
And that's kind of more
of the goal. So it's
a complete like gearshift.

25:48.214 --> 25:52.416
<i> A stock chassis has a lot</i>
<i> of extra things that we would</i>
<i> normally get rid of.</i>

25:52.451 --> 25:56.020
<i> But you know what, this stock</i>
<i> chassis has some character,</i>
<i> you can see how it was built,</i>

25:56.055 --> 25:59.056
you can imagine this thing
getting built back
in the '60s.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.693
It's pretty cool,
I appreciate it.
In a way this is easier.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.729
But we also have to be really
careful that we want
it to be exactly

26:05.765 --> 26:09.767
how it came from the factory.
So things are completely
different for us over here

26:09.802 --> 26:12.036
in the assembly area.
There's no polish washers.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.573
There's not a lot of chrome
parts on the chassis at all,
there's a lot of zinc,

26:15.608 --> 26:18.742
there's a lot of just brass,
the lines are stainless
and nice

26:18.778 --> 26:22.313
but we didn't polish them,
you can see it's just got
standard hardware in it,

26:22.348 --> 26:25.449
we didn't put them
on the buffer, we didn't
smooth any of the welds off,

26:25.484 --> 26:28.819
we left them just the way
they were, we basically
just blasted the chassis

26:28.854 --> 26:32.423
and we had it powder coated
and maybe even powder coating
was a step too far,

26:32.458 --> 26:35.392
but we thought that it needed
the optimum protection.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.128
So we went ahead
and did that, but if you
look close you can see

26:38.164 --> 26:41.098
just how these are welded
at the factory back in 1966.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.634
There's just slag everywhere.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.769
You know, they're kind of
just welded quickly.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.539
We just kind
of left it raw factory bare,

26:48.574 --> 26:50.941
everything's going back,
you know, we've got
the steering box,

26:50.977 --> 26:54.011
we didn't upgrade the rack
and pinion, we didn't
upgrade to anything.

26:54.046 --> 26:57.214
Basically just going
to be stock 1966.

26:57.249 --> 27:01.619
It's just supposed
to look factory. Factory,
but maybe a little bit better.

27:01.654 --> 27:06.323
[dave]<i> no chassis is complete</i>
<i> without its drive train and</i>
<i>this 427 big block is perfect,</i>

27:06.359 --> 27:11.061
especially being restored back
to its original hugger orange
with all of the fine details.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.963
<i> It's going to look beautiful</i>
<i> sitting in this car.</i>

27:18.771 --> 27:21.205
[pringle] one second.
I can almost
get a bolt in here.

27:23.509 --> 27:26.610
That there is...

27:26.646 --> 27:28.078
-[roy] we're in.
-[pringle] there you go.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.113
How's that?

27:30.416 --> 27:32.650
-[pringle] yeah. Sweet.
-We're good.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.685
My main worry
is not scratching stuff.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.954
This is a lot of stuff
to hook up.

27:39.392 --> 27:42.292
[kevin] this has
got the big block
with the four-speed. I mean,

27:42.328 --> 27:45.596
this is just true, iconic
american muscle car
right here.

27:50.803 --> 27:55.005
<i>Everything is coming together.</i>
<i> The chassis is all put</i>
<i>together, the body's polished.</i>

27:55.041 --> 27:57.474
Let's marry these things.

27:57.510 --> 28:02.446
It's gonna look amazing
with all the restored parts
and the wheels.

28:02.481 --> 28:06.083
Okay, perfect.
Thank you, guys.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.819
-[man] happy hanukkah.
-[kevin] that's dead sexy
there, boys.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.320
[man] it's christmas.

28:10.356 --> 28:13.457
-[kevin] that's really nice.
-Can't beat black.

28:13.492 --> 28:17.695
Dude, that's shinier and
deeper than it ever thought
about being from the factory.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.163
That thing looks sweet.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.333
[kevin] the chassis
looks amazing.
The car looks amazing.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.502
We'll put the two together.
They're gonna have
amazing babies.

28:25.538 --> 28:26.970
That's how that works.

28:27.006 --> 28:28.605
Little baby corvettes.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.142
In and as soon as we're ready,

28:32.178 --> 28:35.512
we'll cut this thing loose
and get it down
on the chassis. I'm excited.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.614
<i> The chassis is complete,</i>
<i> the body's polished,</i>

28:37.650 --> 28:39.416
<i> we're ready to put these</i>
<i> things together.</i>

28:39.452 --> 28:41.652
<i> When the customers brought</i>
<i> this car here,</i>

28:41.687 --> 28:44.354
they had one condition,
that we added
air conditioning.

28:46.726 --> 28:50.127
[justin] so this car didn't
have air conditioning
from the factory.

28:50.162 --> 28:53.597
You know we're trying to make
this a correct restoration,
if you would.

28:53.632 --> 28:57.101
It's a factory ac unit
that we've just restored
in house.

28:57.136 --> 28:59.903
<i> You know, the fit's great,</i>
<i> it's pretty heavy,</i>

28:59.939 --> 29:02.439
<i> but it's gonna make</i>
<i> it easier in the long run</i>
<i> to get this in.</i>

29:02.475 --> 29:04.541
<i> You know, and the wipers</i>
<i> mounted in here because</i>

29:04.577 --> 29:06.710
this is a big block car
and there's not a lot of room.

29:12.818 --> 29:15.319
[kevin]<i> so this car</i>
<i> originally didn't come</i>
<i> with air conditioning.</i>

29:15.354 --> 29:17.421
To add it in is
a little bit tricky,

29:17.456 --> 29:19.857
but you know,
it's gonna be worth it.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.325
[kevin] let's go your way now.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.327
Watch that back, roy.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.863
[roy] I almost hit the body.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.531
I'm gonna get my saws off.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.566
Oh, it looks like we got
to cut it up here then.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.538
[kevin] there we go.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.607
If you see something
you don't like, call it out.

29:39.712 --> 29:41.411
Wait, hold it.

29:41.447 --> 29:42.579
[roy] it should be free
and clear, right?

29:42.615 --> 29:44.481
[kevin] let's just
keep an eye on everything.

29:47.353 --> 29:48.385
We got to go this way.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.054
[kevin] let's try it out.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.122
[roy] put us in the ball park.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.590
Okay, bring it on down
to chinatown.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.593
Am I good
to go more?

29:56.629 --> 29:58.395
I'm not gonna hit anything,
so, yeah.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.664
[kevin] how's the front
of that gas tank?

30:00.699 --> 30:02.766
[roy] it looks really close
from what I see.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.201
[kevin] coming down.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.703
[roy] the back should be
contacting right now.

30:06.739 --> 30:10.974
I think we're good. As long as
we're not getting hung up
on anything. We're good.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.610
[justin] three, two, one,
contact.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.548
Oy] to the moon, alex.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.651
[kevin]<i> the '66 corvette</i>
<i> is now in assembly.</i>

30:20.686 --> 30:22.986
All the parts have been
restored or replaced.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.822
Now it's time to get
these things all back
on the car.

30:28.727 --> 30:31.995
[dave]<i> you know, it's really</i>
<i> been a while since we've done</i>
<i> a stock restoration,</i>

30:32.031 --> 30:35.265
<i> but this is actually</i>
<i> refreshing. We've got roy,</i>
<i> our good old boy</i>

30:35.301 --> 30:38.068
<i> doing the assembly</i>
<i> on this car, it's going</i>
<i> right together.</i>

30:38.103 --> 30:40.003
There's not a lot
of custom panels.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.905
There's not a lot
of things that are out
of the ordinary.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.874
<i> This thing's going</i>
<i> together slick.</i>

30:46.846 --> 30:53.283
All right, roy. I took
a moment last night and I
drew up this wiring diagram.

30:53.319 --> 30:56.153
<i> Everybody around the shop</i>
<i> knows I like to nerd out</i>
<i> with wiring.</i>

30:56.188 --> 30:59.556
So I took just a couple
of minutes and I whipped
up this wiring diagram

30:59.592 --> 31:00.958
to give the roy this morning.

31:00.993 --> 31:03.560
-I thank you so much for that.
-I know right. You're welcome.

31:05.497 --> 31:08.365
The wiring is completely
different than we normally do.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.235
-So normally, we buy...
-Wire by wire.

31:11.270 --> 31:15.105
100% wire by wire,
it's all custom. Well,
we didn't change anything.

31:15.140 --> 31:18.942
They already make
a complete replacement
harness.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.845
So this isn't really
like a wiring job.
This is more just like--

31:21.881 --> 31:25.682
plug and play. It's not
that bad. It's just that we're
not scratch wiring.

31:25.718 --> 31:27.351
So this should be interesting.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.585
It should be.

31:35.394 --> 31:39.196
This is an iconic car
because this is a 427
big block car.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.764
One of my favorites.

31:40.799 --> 31:44.635
The new corvettes,
don't even ask me about that.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.605
You have to work
for nasa to work
on those cars.

31:48.641 --> 31:51.408
It looks like you're making
amazing progress
on this thing.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.845
You have about, what 99%
of the wires in this thing?

31:54.880 --> 31:56.546
-Ninety-nine.
-I like it. I like it.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.015
Does the headlights work?

31:59.518 --> 32:01.151
[kevin] oh, yeah, boy.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.687
I like it.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.022
[honks]

32:05.057 --> 32:06.423
got a horn.

32:06.458 --> 32:09.226
So we're starting...
Those are the basics,
we have lights.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.661
-[roy] turn signal.
-We have horn,

32:10.696 --> 32:12.029
we have turn signals.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.430
Back brake and...

32:15.100 --> 32:17.301
Yep, good. You got it.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.669
Reverse.

32:18.704 --> 32:19.836
Does it run?

32:21.106 --> 32:22.105
[engine roaring]

32:24.343 --> 32:27.110
[kevin] just like it ran
before we took it apart.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.545
That's awesome.

32:28.580 --> 32:29.846
Go ahead and shut her down.

32:29.882 --> 32:32.683
What saved me is that
schematic you gave me...

32:32.718 --> 32:35.085
Oh, yeah, I do what I can.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.420
[laughing]

32:41.427 --> 32:43.927
and come out...

32:43.963 --> 32:47.631
[dave]<i> hanging and aligning</i>
<i> these doors in this corvette</i>
<i>is actually one of the biggest</i>

32:47.666 --> 32:51.501
<i> last steps of the assembly.</i>
<i>One of the big keys is getting</i>
<i> the door gaps</i>

32:51.537 --> 32:54.438
<i> perfect on this car.</i>
<i> Now it was perfect when</i>
<i> it was body-worked.</i>

32:54.473 --> 32:57.841
Now that it's going back
together with paint on it,
it should be flawless.

32:57.876 --> 33:00.110
We'll pull these out
and we'll see where we live.

33:02.715 --> 33:04.648
[roy] it actually looks
like it fits well.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.117
But then again,
this is a fiberglass car

33:07.152 --> 33:09.553
and when you bolted
the chassis, things move.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.521
We're hoping for the best.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.924
One down, one the go.

33:13.959 --> 33:17.394
[dave]<i> back in the '60s,</i>
<i> the cars weren't built</i>
<i> by a computer. So,</i>

33:17.429 --> 33:20.464
every one of these cars might
have had a little bit
difference in the shims

33:20.499 --> 33:22.766
or the fitment of the doors.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.702
Right here we're kind of
touching there.
So we might need to adjust.

33:25.738 --> 33:27.471
Push it up.

33:27.506 --> 33:31.675
I think we're 1/8 inch in here
and one over here,

33:31.710 --> 33:35.412
just to get it just right,
just got to kind of
be patient with it.

33:35.447 --> 33:36.480
Theoretically.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.651
This one in particular,
we got to make sure
that we split the hairs

33:41.687 --> 33:43.620
and make sure that it has just
the right amount of shims

33:43.655 --> 33:44.821
to make this door
fit perfectly.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.625
It's too hard to slide
it in right there.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.395
All right.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.597
-You ready to test her out?
-Be very careful with it.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.034
Yep.

33:59.304 --> 34:00.670
Doors on.

34:04.309 --> 34:07.144
[dave]<i> even though we're</i>
<i> putting a new black</i>
<i> cloth top on this,</i>

34:07.179 --> 34:08.745
<i> as well as velour carpet,</i>

34:08.781 --> 34:11.281
the rest of the car's really
in great shape, and we're
gonna go ahead

34:11.316 --> 34:14.551
and utilize
the original seat covers
and door panels.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.987
To me, this is like
the ultimate convertible
right here.

34:17.022 --> 34:18.822
Triple black
with the red lines.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.359
I got to build the convertible
top pads,

34:22.394 --> 34:24.261
because they don't make
those the way I want them.

34:24.296 --> 34:26.530
The first thing we're gonna do
is we gonna build those
so they match

34:26.565 --> 34:28.865
<i> the safe house canvas</i>
<i> with the top we ordered.</i>

34:28.901 --> 34:31.701
<i>I'll put the hardware on this,</i>
<i> get a bow height set,</i>

34:31.737 --> 34:35.605
we'll get the convertible
top pads built to our 18
and a half inch bow height.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.507
And then we'll install
this top.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.643
Awesome. I think
that black canvas top's gonna
look so much better

34:39.678 --> 34:41.244
-than the white vinyl one.
-I agree.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.980
[dave]<i> I'm changing this top</i>
<i> from white to black canvas</i>

34:44.016 --> 34:47.451
and also going to velour
mercedes carpet because
it's just a bit nicer.

34:47.486 --> 34:49.419
But you know what?
Justin's got this.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.922
-Yeah, we'll make that happen.
-It's pretty easy?

34:51.957 --> 34:53.156
No. It's not.

34:53.192 --> 34:55.192
[laughs]

34:55.227 --> 34:58.829
so you're saying
there's a chance though, okay.

34:58.864 --> 35:03.166
[justin] the trickiest part is
making sure though, the frame
itself is all set up right.

35:03.202 --> 35:07.003
If you're going to go
install at top to a bent out
frame or a crooked frame,

35:07.039 --> 35:10.073
you're going to have
some problems.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.676
The most important step
to this convertible top
on this corvette

35:12.711 --> 35:15.011
is to find the bow height.

35:15.047 --> 35:18.548
Bow height, very, very,
very important.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.784
Everything's got to start
with the bow height.

35:20.819 --> 35:24.721
This doesn't change,
that's got to stay within
a quarter-inch tolerance,

35:24.756 --> 35:27.190
or the pre fit top
will not fit.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.459
The next thing we got
to do is we got to build
convertible top pads.

35:31.029 --> 35:32.729
<i> When this top folds up,</i>

35:32.764 --> 35:34.731
<i> and all these areas</i>
<i> fold together,</i>

35:34.766 --> 35:37.534
it doesn't pinch the top,
it pinches the pad itself.

35:40.272 --> 35:42.706
<i> Okay, so we got</i>
<i> the convertible top pads on.</i>

35:42.741 --> 35:45.242
<i> It'll give it a nice clean</i>
<i> look like this.</i>

35:45.277 --> 35:48.211
The foam in there will
help protect all these hinges.

35:48.247 --> 35:52.149
And then we're ready to start
putting a top on this.

35:52.184 --> 35:55.552
The last thing we got to do
here is install this top
by gluing it into place,

35:55.587 --> 35:59.623
a few staples, a little bit
of glue, make sure it's
stretched out really nice.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.325
The key here is, make sure
this edge is all even.

36:02.361 --> 36:05.929
But I took
that pre-measurement
and I got to make sure

36:05.964 --> 36:09.199
when this comes around,
we're at this line.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.234
And we are.

36:13.672 --> 36:17.307
I got all this tucked in.
We're gonna screw
this back on and then

36:17.342 --> 36:20.877
we'll pull this thing forward
and see what it looks like.

36:20.913 --> 36:22.812
It's fitting really nice,
actually.

36:23.549 --> 36:24.915
I like it.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.316
Let's see how this side is.

36:27.619 --> 36:28.885
This side's on the money.

36:30.255 --> 36:32.889
A couple things I want
to check though.

36:32.925 --> 36:36.426
This being a convertible top,
sometimes if there's
enough pressure on this,

36:36.461 --> 36:39.229
it'll pull that windshield
frame back

36:39.264 --> 36:41.998
which will screw up
all your door alignments.

36:42.034 --> 36:45.368
So you want
to come in here and check

36:45.404 --> 36:48.705
your door gaps. We still got
a real good door gap there.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.808
Here, this is good
so that's telling me

36:51.843 --> 36:54.377
there's not a ton
of pressure on this side,
and this side to me,

36:55.948 --> 36:56.947
was the tightest.

37:01.119 --> 37:04.287
[dave]<i> the black top looks</i>
<i> beautiful on this car and</i>
<i> now alls he's got left</i>

37:04.323 --> 37:06.723
<i> is to wrap-up</i>
<i> this mercedes carpet.</i>

37:06.758 --> 37:09.926
Hey, we're almost done
with this car and ready
to give it back to the client.

37:09.962 --> 37:14.798
And with the high-end carpet
that we're putting in this,
we can't mold it so,

37:14.833 --> 37:17.767
I've got to pre-fit stuff
or there's not going
to be binding

37:17.803 --> 37:21.471
and still make it look
somewhat factory, and then
I'm gonna try to bind it

37:21.506 --> 37:24.874
with all the factory stuff...
So, I'm going replicate that

37:24.910 --> 37:28.144
but I'm going to replicate
it with the mercedes
cup car.

37:32.618 --> 37:35.051
Oh, man, that's looking
beautiful buddy.

37:35.087 --> 37:38.688
Those are three great things
a car should do, it runs,
it drives and it stops.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.957
I have to tell you, roy,
you did an amazing job.

37:40.993 --> 37:43.860
You know I'm very excited
to how this '66 corvette's
turned out.

37:43.895 --> 37:47.530
I challenged roy and all
the rest of the guys here
to do a great restoration

37:47.566 --> 37:49.866
<i> and they've not disappointed.</i>

37:49.901 --> 37:52.168
I can't wait to take
this old bad boy for a spin

37:52.204 --> 37:53.770
and then give it back
to the client.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.473
I'm going to probably grab
it first thing in the morning

37:56.508 --> 37:58.141
-and head up to park city
and drop it off.
-Great.

38:04.383 --> 38:05.749
[eagle screeching]

38:12.557 --> 38:14.958
you know what?
This looks like
a great place.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.961
Here we are in not beautiful
downtown salt lake city,

38:17.996 --> 38:21.164
<i>but rather up in the mountains</i>
<i> which is better than</i>
<i> anywhere else on this planet.</i>

38:21.199 --> 38:24.167
Man, what a beautiful day.

38:24.202 --> 38:26.936
-A beautiful day.
Look at this beautiful place.
-[eagle screeches]

38:26.972 --> 38:29.539
[dave] he agrees.
He's loving the car.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.908
-It's really nice up here.
-I know, we should
stay up here.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.844
-Forever?
-Yeah, with this car.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.413
[dave] I'm gonna miss
this car.

38:36.448 --> 38:39.082
I am gonna miss this car too.
Restorations are the most
exciting thing,

38:39.117 --> 38:41.284
but the way that this thing
turned out...

38:41.320 --> 38:44.721
[dave]<i> the story behind</i>
<i> the car and, yes, the fact</i>
<i> that it's triple black</i>

38:44.756 --> 38:46.156
<i> is like priceless.</i>

38:46.191 --> 38:47.957
I mean, I wear triple black
every day.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.360
Hey, I'm almost there.
I'm double black
with a little gray.

38:50.395 --> 38:52.395
-Double black.
-And not up here.

38:52.431 --> 38:55.432
We might have gone overboard
on the restoration
it's so nice, I think.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.933
-But that's what we do.
-That's what we do.

38:56.968 --> 38:59.336
[dave]<i> at the end of the day,</i>
<i> we didn't have</i>
<i> a lot of stuff to do</i>

38:59.371 --> 39:02.038
<i> as far as fiberglass repair</i>
<i> and replacement.</i>

39:02.074 --> 39:04.607
The bumpers look beautiful.
Let's take a look
under the hood.

39:04.643 --> 39:07.243
You know this is a little bit
different, jewelry box

39:07.279 --> 39:10.580
from what we're normally doing
because we didn't go, bam,

39:10.615 --> 39:13.550
actually, we did
just the opposite,
but we did it so nicely.

39:13.585 --> 39:16.152
-[eagle screeches]
-he agrees. [bleep]

39:16.188 --> 39:18.555
-dude, he's coming down.
-He's coming to get you.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.524
I've learned a lot
about corvette engine base.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.493
-Right.
-Well, when they put
air conditioning

39:23.528 --> 39:26.029
in the factory, they moved
the battery to the left side.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.598
-See, I would never
have known that.
-Neither did I.

39:28.633 --> 39:32.435
And it's almost impossible
to get that ac unit in the car
without taking the motor out.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.838
Oh, 100%. And so we got rid
of the smog pump,

39:34.873 --> 39:37.574
<i> and we added</i>
<i> the air conditioning pump</i>
<i> but again,</i>

39:37.609 --> 39:40.910
<i> this is as factory-looking</i>
<i> as it should be. I mean,</i>
<i> down to the line</i>

39:40.946 --> 39:43.279
on the gm hoses,
the gm heater lines.

39:43.315 --> 39:45.648
[dave]<i> this really</i>
<i> looks beautiful</i>
<i> under the hood</i>

39:45.684 --> 39:48.351
with a couple
of chrome accents and all
of the original lettering

39:48.387 --> 39:50.620
and stripes back on the hoses,
the way it should be.

39:50.655 --> 39:52.455
I mean, honestly the car,

39:52.491 --> 39:55.692
it looks and smells
like a brand-new '66.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.627
Mmm-hmm.
And '66 was a great year.

39:57.662 --> 39:59.329
-That's when you
were born, right?
-Stop.

39:59.364 --> 40:00.463
[laughs]

40:02.834 --> 40:05.402
you know, overall, I think
doing a restoration
on this car,

40:05.437 --> 40:08.171
-it sits actually really nice
for a stock vehicle.
-100%.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.807
All the suspension
is new too, but like I said,
it's all factory.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.176
That black canvas top looks
so much better

40:13.211 --> 40:15.178
<i> than that crappy</i>
<i> old white vinyl.</i>

40:15.213 --> 40:18.415
[kevin]<i> it was like the white</i>
<i> vinyl was trying to match</i>
<i> the white walls on the tire.</i>

40:18.450 --> 40:20.750
[dave]<i> tires got to go,</i>
<i> same with that top.</i>

40:20.786 --> 40:23.820
But one of my very
favorite parts has always
been red line wheels

40:23.855 --> 40:25.855
-on something like this.
-Remember when it came in,

40:25.891 --> 40:27.657
it had those like weird
white wall things.

40:27.692 --> 40:30.527
[dave]<i> I was really hoping</i>
<i> for a tire fire because those</i>
<i> sucked so bad.</i>

40:30.562 --> 40:33.763
<i> It's the worst looking</i>
<i> tires I've ever seen</i>
<i> in my life.</i>

40:33.799 --> 40:35.498
This was really nice that
they allowed us to put

40:35.534 --> 40:37.767
a proper tire on the car.
It's a radial.

40:37.803 --> 40:41.604
It has a great looking
red line and it really makes
those knockoff wheels

40:41.640 --> 40:45.008
look beautiful, all restored.
It's a nice finishing touch.

40:45.043 --> 40:48.044
[kevin] I don't think you can
go wrong with red lines
on a triple black car period.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.513
Nope. Speaking
of triple black, let's take
a look at the interior.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.215
Oh, totally it came
out so good.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.717
[dave]<i> changing up the</i>
<i> steering wheel was a nice</i>
<i> thing because the other one</i>

40:54.753 --> 40:57.053
<i> was pretty beat up. It just</i>
<i> so happened we had that one</i>
<i> in the shop</i>

40:57.088 --> 40:58.688
<i> and it looks beautiful--</i>

40:58.723 --> 41:00.690
[kevin]<i> that was one thing</i>
<i> I was kind of disappointed</i>
<i> about.</i>

41:00.725 --> 41:02.859
-Not having the wood
for the sex appeal.
-That's true.

41:02.894 --> 41:05.495
-The only piece of wood
in the whole car.
-I totally get it.

41:05.530 --> 41:08.631
This one looks way better,
I agree, but I was a little
bummed to see it go.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.234
So one of the really cool
things about this interior

41:11.269 --> 41:13.536
is a lot of it was so nice
that we didn't have
to replace it,

41:13.572 --> 41:16.773
like the seats. We just
cleaned the seats up,
one of the backs

41:16.808 --> 41:19.776
was broken, so we got
a new back for it
and then, obviously,

41:19.811 --> 41:22.011
you can see we've added
the ducts underneath the dash.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.514
Those are actually
another part that comes
with the ac.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.950
Most guys that add
air conditioning
to these cars,

41:26.985 --> 41:29.953
don't use the center vent
because it's too difficult
to put in.

41:29.988 --> 41:33.156
-We are professionals.
-Well, look. We have
a center vent.

41:33.191 --> 41:34.524
[dave] that's right.

41:34.559 --> 41:36.493
<i> Last but not least,</i>
<i> down to the very bottom</i>
<i> of the cabin,</i>

41:36.528 --> 41:38.962
<i> well, that's velour carpet</i>
<i> from a mercedes.</i>

41:38.997 --> 41:42.198
<i> It's black, it's deep,</i>
<i> and it is super soft.</i>

41:42.234 --> 41:44.667
And it'll stay looking great
for a very long time.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.236
It's such a nice day.

41:46.271 --> 41:48.037
Why don't we put the top down
and go for ride?

41:48.073 --> 41:49.973
Well, I got a lot to do.
But we might as well,
we're here.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.641
[laughs]

41:51.676 --> 41:54.611
-let's do it.
-Let's do it.

41:54.646 --> 41:57.046
We didn't do
any custom at all,
we did a full restoration.

41:57.082 --> 42:00.850
<i> And this is exactly that.</i>
<i> One bitchin' restoration.</i>

42:00.886 --> 42:02.719
-That's why
I love my job.
-[kevin chuckles]

42:07.559 --> 42:08.758
[engine roaring]

42:10.362 --> 42:12.128
[kevin] oh, what a great day
to be alive.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.197
-A triple black corvette--
-I'll tell you what...

42:14.232 --> 42:15.899
-And it has plenty of power.
-Totally.

42:15.934 --> 42:19.202
Which is great.
And it sounds awesome.
Those tail pipes are rad.

42:21.172 --> 42:24.107
[kevin]<i> it's raw,</i>
<i> you can feel the road,</i>
<i> you can hear the engine,</i>

42:24.142 --> 42:25.875
you can feel the shift
from first to second.

42:25.911 --> 42:29.579
I mean, you can just feel it,
it's just a raw american
sports car,

42:29.614 --> 42:32.615
[dave] you got to drive
this car. This certainly
isn't a prius.

42:32.651 --> 42:35.885
[kevin] they're gonna get
the feeling that they
had back in the day.

42:35.921 --> 42:38.288
And that to me is really,
really, really important.

42:38.323 --> 42:41.057
The memories that they
had in this car and how long
it has been the family,

42:41.092 --> 42:42.559
like it's just really cool.

42:42.594 --> 42:44.761
The owners of the car have had
it for over 25 years

42:44.796 --> 42:47.830
and I bet they're gonna have
it for at least another
25 years.

42:47.866 --> 42:50.133
The engine just purrs,

42:50.168 --> 42:53.803
ac feels good,
the updated bluetooth stereo
feels great. I mean.

42:53.838 --> 42:55.038
Speaking of that,

42:56.575 --> 42:57.774
let's turn that on.

42:57.809 --> 42:59.776
[upbeat music playing]

42:59.811 --> 43:01.678
-it sounds great.
-That's perfect.

43:01.713 --> 43:04.047
It's perfect.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.649
This was a great
experience for me
driving kevin around

43:06.685 --> 43:09.552
in a car that I'm not going
to actually scare
the complete crap out of him.

43:09.588 --> 43:12.088
Telescopic is a really cool
feature on this car.

43:12.123 --> 43:14.891
I think it is super cool
because it's actually, it just
makes it so much easier

43:14.926 --> 43:16.559
-to get your car--
-you're not supposed to do
it while you driving.

43:16.595 --> 43:17.594
It doesn't really matter.

43:17.629 --> 43:18.828
I like that.

43:19.798 --> 43:21.931
[dave] whee!
It drives straight too.

43:21.967 --> 43:24.133
[kevin] it's 25 in here, bro.
You're gonna get
us in trouble.

43:24.169 --> 43:25.635
[dave] I forgot
about that...
