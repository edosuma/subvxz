02:42.598 --> 02:47.269
On behalf of your commanding officer,
I'm sure I can tell Mr. JosÃ© Iturbi

02:47.436 --> 02:50.164
that the officers and crew
of this ship are grateful to him

02:50.431 --> 02:53.567
for coming here to lead
our Navy bands in this ceremony.

02:53.734 --> 02:58.364
Along with every other civilian,
it is I who am grateful to you

02:58.530 --> 03:01.200
and to all the men
in the United States Navy.

03:01.367 --> 03:04.453
The men who are to be decorated
are present, sir.

03:06.872 --> 03:09.291
Joseph Brady,
Gunner's Mate Second Class.

03:09.458 --> 03:12.378
Clarence Doolittle, Seaman First Class.

03:14.922 --> 03:17.883
During the action aboard
the USS cruiser <i>Knoxville</i>

03:18.050 --> 03:20.219
these two men
remained at their stations

03:20.386 --> 03:23.055
serving their gun
until the ammunition was exhausted.

03:23.222 --> 03:26.183
When by force of explosion,
Doolittle was blown overboard

03:26.392 --> 03:29.895
Joseph Brady, without regard
for his own personal safety

03:30.062 --> 03:32.773
dived into the sea
and rescued his shipmate.

03:33.482 --> 03:38.904
Acting for the secretary of the Navy,
I award you both the Silver Star.

03:45.869 --> 03:48.789
- Congratulations, Brady.
- Thank you, sir.

03:57.089 --> 04:00.175
- Congratulations, Doolittle.
- Thank you, sir.

04:08.767 --> 04:11.186
To the men who formally
served on the <i>Knoxville</i>

04:11.353 --> 04:13.314
including those I've just decorated

04:13.522 --> 04:16.608
you'll be granted four days' leave,
effective immediately.

04:16.817 --> 04:18.861
Leave your quarter.

04:28.662 --> 04:30.956
Let me through, boys.

04:31.290 --> 04:33.250
Yeah, I'm hopeful.

04:42.301 --> 04:44.428
The poor little fellas.

04:44.595 --> 04:47.097
They gotta stay and mind the ship
for the admiral.

04:47.264 --> 04:49.725
- That's right.
- That's it, rub it in.

04:49.933 --> 04:52.144
They don't get to go to Hollywood

04:52.311 --> 04:54.730
where the beautiful dames
grow like oranges.

04:54.897 --> 04:58.817
Where all you gotta do is reach out
and pick them right off the street.

04:58.984 --> 05:00.653
- Congratulations, Joe.
- Thanks.

05:00.819 --> 05:02.529
You'll probably visit the studios

05:02.696 --> 05:05.532
if you see those stars,
will you get me some autographs?

05:05.699 --> 05:08.118
Oh, no, not this baby.
After eight months at sea

05:08.285 --> 05:11.288
it ain't a bunch of autographs
I'm gonna wind up with. Here.

05:11.455 --> 05:14.333
- I got plans.
- What kind of plans, Joe?

05:14.500 --> 05:19.380
Well, in Hollywood,
I've got a little plan named Lola.

05:21.674 --> 05:23.217
Oh, that Lola.

05:23.384 --> 05:25.511
I tell you, she's a...

05:26.887 --> 05:30.557
Well, it isn't exactly that,
but it's a...

05:31.308 --> 05:33.978
- No, it isn't that either.
- Tell us about her, Joe.

05:34.144 --> 05:35.688
- Yeah.
- Well

05:35.854 --> 05:39.233
notice how different the band
sounded with that guy Iturbi leading?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.443
- That was good.
- Lola's kind of like that.

05:41.610 --> 05:44.113
Put her with the most beautiful dames
in the world

05:44.279 --> 05:46.115
she's the one you'd see, that's all.

05:46.281 --> 05:49.493
You mean she's different, huh, Joe?

05:50.202 --> 05:51.704
I wouldn't say that.

05:51.870 --> 05:55.749
If you like dames, what's the point of
getting one different from other dames?

05:55.916 --> 06:00.838
No, I guess it's just that whatever
the others have, Lola has more of it.

06:01.005 --> 06:02.339
Does she got a sister?

06:02.506 --> 06:05.009
Hey, what makes you think
this Lola is still waiting?

06:05.175 --> 06:06.927
Dames have been known to wander.

06:07.094 --> 06:12.308
From me? Please, sailor,
leave us not talk mutiny.

06:14.393 --> 06:17.896
<i>Fall in to the port side of the hangar</i>
<i>deck for special leave.</i>

06:18.939 --> 06:21.942
Oh, do you think
we can tear ourselves away?

06:22.109 --> 06:24.236
Yeah, but it'll be tough.

06:24.403 --> 06:27.823
- We hate to leave.
- We hate to leave.

06:27.990 --> 06:31.910
<i>But when they give you leave</i>
<i>You gotta leave</i>

06:32.077 --> 06:35.664
<i>Oh, our hearts bleed</i>
<i>For all of you guys aboard</i>

06:35.831 --> 06:38.792
<i>But right now</i>
<i>Sympathy is a thing we can't afford</i>

06:38.959 --> 06:40.711
<i>- We hate to leave</i>
<i>- We hate to leave</i>

06:40.878 --> 06:42.546
<i>- We hate to leave</i>
<i>- We hate to leave</i>

06:42.713 --> 06:44.381
<i>Without you guys along</i>

06:44.548 --> 06:46.508
<i>We'll grieve and grieve</i>

06:46.675 --> 06:50.262
<i>But we'll be back, yes, we'll be back</i>
<i>Before we're even missed</i>

06:50.429 --> 06:53.724
<i>And tell you guys about the countless</i>
<i>Dames that we have kissed</i>

06:53.891 --> 06:55.559
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

06:55.726 --> 06:57.436
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

06:57.603 --> 07:01.315
<i>We really hate to leave</i>

07:02.566 --> 07:05.903
You know, Clarence,
I think it's awful, us going ashore

07:06.070 --> 07:08.614
leaving these guys here
in their undershirts

07:08.781 --> 07:10.824
and we gotta go meet beautiful dames

07:10.991 --> 07:12.618
in their soft silk dresses.

07:12.785 --> 07:15.996
Yeah, but duty is duty,
and an order is an order.

07:16.163 --> 07:18.457
You know, I know some guys
that get a thrill

07:18.624 --> 07:21.168
out of meeting a gorgeous gal
every night.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.921
<i>We hate to leave</i>

07:24.088 --> 07:26.090
<i>We hate to leave</i>

07:26.298 --> 07:27.716
<i>But when they give you leave</i>

07:27.883 --> 07:29.301
<i>You gotta leave</i>

07:30.427 --> 07:33.722
<i>No more pinup gals</i>
<i>That we so enjoy</i>

07:33.889 --> 07:37.059
<i>Tonight, fair boys</i>
<i>We get to meet the real McCoy</i>

07:37.267 --> 07:38.978
<i>We hate to leave</i>

07:39.144 --> 07:40.729
<i>We hate to leave</i>

07:40.896 --> 07:42.731
<i>But we'll be back before</i>

07:42.898 --> 07:44.858
<i>The anchors heave</i>

07:45.025 --> 07:48.654
<i>We wanna stay, we wanna stay</i>
<i>Our hearts are with the ship</i>

07:48.821 --> 07:52.157
<i>But the admiral made us take this leave</i>
<i>He beat us with a whip</i>

07:52.324 --> 07:54.201
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

07:54.368 --> 07:56.120
<i>Believe us, mate</i>

07:56.286 --> 07:58.831
<i>We really</i>

08:00.040 --> 08:03.669
<i>Hate to leave</i>

08:16.724 --> 08:20.811
But, honey, I saved every minute
of my leave for you.

08:21.603 --> 08:24.023
Oh, why shouldn't I have?

08:24.523 --> 08:27.818
Oh, you're the only one any place
I wanna see.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.778
What's he doing wrong, Joe?

08:29.945 --> 08:31.822
He's dead, that's all. Watch.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.323
But ho...

08:33.490 --> 08:37.160
But, honey, I don't wanna meet
your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.

08:37.328 --> 08:39.496
I wanna meet you.

08:40.246 --> 08:42.875
Well, you'll be sorry.

08:44.335 --> 08:47.338
You'll be sorry.

08:51.175 --> 08:53.177
Hello, Ms. Laverne?

08:53.510 --> 08:55.471
Ms. Lola Laverne?

08:58.182 --> 09:02.394
Is this the face that launched
a thousand ships?

09:03.354 --> 09:06.273
Yeah. Yeah, it's Joe, all right.

09:06.899 --> 09:10.569
Don't anybody even want
a cup of coffee?

09:13.656 --> 09:15.199
No business.

09:15.366 --> 09:18.827
Well, it'll be a couple hours
before I hit Hollywood.

09:18.994 --> 09:20.704
Can you wait?

09:21.955 --> 09:25.918
Oh, I know what you mean, baby.

09:26.085 --> 09:27.503
But you just try.

09:28.212 --> 09:31.090
Let's decide that later,
after eight months at sea

09:31.256 --> 09:36.011
all I wanna do is just look at you
for a long, long time.

09:42.810 --> 09:45.938
Oh, you'll like. For sure.

09:50.985 --> 09:53.445
- Come on, get a move on.
- Come on.

09:54.905 --> 09:58.742
Come on, eight months
is a long enough time to wait.

10:01.662 --> 10:03.330
Hello?

10:04.331 --> 10:07.084
Hello, you beautiful creature.

10:07.251 --> 10:12.381
When you hear the tone, the time
will be exactly 6:10 and one quarter.

10:12.548 --> 10:14.258
Buy war bonds.

10:15.801 --> 10:18.345
Thank you, I will.

10:18.721 --> 10:21.432
Hey, you guys,
the buses for Hollywood pulled up!

10:21.598 --> 10:24.852
- Get me to Hollywood.
- Here we come.

10:25.019 --> 10:27.146
- Here we go, boys. Come on.
- Hey.

10:27.313 --> 10:31.108
- Give my regards to Lana Turner.
- Who needs a house in Hollywood?

10:40.743 --> 10:44.163
<i>Anchors Aweigh</i>

10:44.330 --> 10:49.001
<i>Farewell to college joys</i>
<i>We sail at...</i>

10:59.595 --> 11:01.263
Hey, sonny.

11:01.430 --> 11:03.599
- Hello.
- What's the matter?

11:03.766 --> 11:05.142
Nothing. Why?

11:05.309 --> 11:07.311
It's late at night,
where are you going?

11:07.478 --> 11:10.272
- To join the Navy.
- Oh, well, you...

11:10.439 --> 11:14.652
- Gonna what?
- I said, I'm going to join the Navy.

11:17.321 --> 11:19.198
- Wait a minute.
- I'm in a hurry.

11:19.365 --> 11:21.992
Take it easy. Where do you live?

11:22.159 --> 11:24.161
- Why?
- Well, I wanna take you home.

11:24.745 --> 11:28.457
But I'm not going home.
I've just come from there.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.168
What's your name?

11:33.462 --> 11:35.965
Look, it's my job
to find little boys that are lost.

11:36.131 --> 11:38.342
Lost is when you don't know
where you're going.

11:38.509 --> 11:41.553
And I do know,
I'm going to join the Navy.

11:41.762 --> 11:43.138
- All right.
- Good night.

11:43.305 --> 11:46.475
If that's the way you want it, okay.
You're coming to the station.

11:46.642 --> 11:49.687
I don't wanna join the police.
I wanna join the Navy.

12:56.962 --> 12:58.797
Stop there.

13:01.634 --> 13:04.219
Are you following me?

13:10.851 --> 13:12.436
What's with you?

13:12.603 --> 13:14.188
Come on, spill it.

13:14.355 --> 13:16.440
Well, you see, it's like this, Joe.

13:16.607 --> 13:18.567
I've been in the Navy
a year and a half.

13:18.734 --> 13:20.903
Every time we hit port and get liberty

13:21.070 --> 13:23.530
all I do is go to the library.

13:23.697 --> 13:26.033
All right, so you like books,
what's the beef?

13:26.200 --> 13:29.411
Well, I thought it'd be fun
to try something different

13:29.578 --> 13:31.246
like going out with girls.

13:31.413 --> 13:34.166
- Okay, good luck.
- But I don't know how to begin.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.627
Oh, no, wait a minute.
Don't give me that "but."

13:36.794 --> 13:39.797
After all, you're no yokel.
You're from Brooklyn.

13:40.005 --> 13:42.800
Even in Brooklyn, things can go wrong.

13:42.967 --> 13:44.426
What do you mean?

13:44.593 --> 13:46.387
Well, right from boys' high school

13:46.553 --> 13:49.098
I went to the
Cathedral of Saint John the Divine

13:49.264 --> 13:51.308
assistant choirmaster.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.228
And out of there, I went into the Navy.

13:54.603 --> 13:56.897
I wouldn't tell that
to anyone but you, Joe.

13:57.106 --> 13:58.607
Sure, sure, I'll keep it quiet.

13:58.774 --> 14:00.859
What do you want,
a couple of phone numbers?

14:01.026 --> 14:03.237
Oh, no, I'd be too scared to use them.

14:03.404 --> 14:06.031
- When you mentioned Lola, I thought...
- Lola?

14:06.198 --> 14:07.533
- Yeah.
- Hey, are you kidding?

14:07.700 --> 14:09.034
Oh, not what you think, Joe.

14:09.201 --> 14:11.537
I thought I'd like
to string along and learn.

14:11.704 --> 14:14.873
After all, you're the best wolf
in the whole Navy.

14:15.040 --> 14:18.293
Well, you are.
And besides, you gotta help me, Joe.

14:18.460 --> 14:21.297
You saved my life
and you owe me something.

14:21.463 --> 14:25.384
I saved your life
so now I owe you something?

14:25.551 --> 14:27.094
Have you gone crazy?

14:27.261 --> 14:30.973
Look, I didn't ask you to save my life,
but you did.

14:31.140 --> 14:34.810
- Now I figure you're responsible for me.
- Well, I don't.

14:34.977 --> 14:39.231
What's the sense of having your life
saved if you can't have any fun with it?

14:43.485 --> 14:46.030
Look, I got a lot to do
in the next four days.

14:46.196 --> 14:47.740
I don't want anybody tailing me.

14:47.948 --> 14:49.658
You say I owe you something.

14:49.825 --> 14:52.995
Well, I don't see it,
but if I find a dame for you

14:53.162 --> 14:55.497
and get you started,
will you call it quits?

14:57.791 --> 15:01.003
Okay, let me see.

15:07.843 --> 15:09.928
Well, we'll have to do
with what you've got.

15:10.471 --> 15:12.556
First place, fix your hat.

15:18.228 --> 15:20.064
Let me see a sample of your technique.

15:20.230 --> 15:22.983
You're you, see?
And I'm a dame coming down the street.

15:23.150 --> 15:24.860
Pick me up.

15:26.487 --> 15:29.782
I'm a dame, see? I'm coming down
the street, now come on.

15:29.948 --> 15:32.409
I beg your pardon, miss.
Lady, could I possibly...?

15:32.576 --> 15:35.204
Oh, no. No.

15:35.412 --> 15:36.872
You gotta give it more:

15:55.641 --> 15:59.186
Listen, Brooklyn, when you're going
hunting it's how you feel that counts.

15:59.353 --> 16:02.064
If you feel like a mouse,
you'll be looking for cheese

16:02.231 --> 16:04.942
that's what you'll get.
But if you feel like a wolf

16:05.109 --> 16:07.111
nothing can go wrong,
you're in control.

16:07.277 --> 16:10.406
Hey, sailors, one of you guys gotta
come down to station with me.

16:10.572 --> 16:13.450
- Any choice? You'll do. Come on.
- Hey, wait a minute.

16:13.617 --> 16:15.619
Please, let's not have
any unpleasantness.

16:15.786 --> 16:18.706
I'll go with you, Joe.
How can this happen to me?

16:18.872 --> 16:21.625
Just when I'm beginning
to feel like a wolf.

16:23.127 --> 16:25.629
The secretary of the Navy
will have a say about this.

16:25.796 --> 16:27.256
Washington will hear about it.

16:27.423 --> 16:29.717
Who's in charge here?
That's what I wanna know.

16:29.883 --> 16:32.386
- Ship ahoy!
- Are you the guy that had me pulled in?

16:32.553 --> 16:35.764
- Pardon me for not getting up.
- What's the charge? What's the idea?

16:35.931 --> 16:38.309
- What are you...?
- If you've been inconvenienced

16:38.475 --> 16:39.810
I'm sorry.

16:39.977 --> 16:42.604
You see, this young man
thinks he should join the Navy.

16:42.771 --> 16:44.315
We think he should go home.

16:44.481 --> 16:47.276
Since he won't tell us where he lives

16:47.860 --> 16:49.862
we thought that maybe a sailor...

16:50.029 --> 16:51.572
See?

16:59.705 --> 17:01.373
So you wanna join the Navy, huh?

17:02.374 --> 17:03.709
Aye, aye, sir.

17:05.586 --> 17:07.421
Attention.

17:07.588 --> 17:09.589
- Name?
- Don Martin, sir.

17:09.757 --> 17:13.176
- Where do you live?
- 1515 Foothill Road.

17:20.142 --> 17:21.602
My daddy was in the Navy

17:21.769 --> 17:24.313
and he said that when
I was grown up, I could join.

17:24.521 --> 17:27.066
And now I am grown up, so I want to.

17:29.068 --> 17:32.029
Well, sure, mate, but...

17:32.196 --> 17:35.449
Well, look, it's this way.
There's sort of a rule in the Navy.

17:35.658 --> 17:40.496
Before they'll take you, you need a letter
from your mom or dad saying it's okay.

17:41.038 --> 17:43.624
But I don't have
a mother or father anymore.

17:46.001 --> 17:48.212
I live with my Aunt Susie.

17:48.420 --> 17:51.006
You think a letter from an aunt
would be all right?

17:51.215 --> 17:55.928
Well, sure, that would be perfect.
Why don't you talk to her about it.

17:56.095 --> 17:58.305
One of these guys
will take you home and...

17:58.472 --> 18:00.516
- You.
- But I got...

18:01.266 --> 18:05.229
- Gotta be a nursemaid and everything...
- Aunt Susie may not give me the letter

18:05.396 --> 18:07.690
but if you asked her...

18:07.856 --> 18:09.984
- You better come along too.
- Oh, no, I can't.

18:10.150 --> 18:11.610
- You come along.
- No, I can't.

18:11.777 --> 18:13.404
What am I gonna do about Lola?

18:18.325 --> 18:20.953
I guess Aunt Susie must be asleep, huh?

18:21.120 --> 18:23.956
- She isn't home yet.
- I suppose the door is locked too.

18:24.123 --> 18:25.582
Yes.

18:26.458 --> 18:28.460
- But we can get in.
- How?

18:28.627 --> 18:30.921
The way I got out.

18:38.637 --> 18:41.181
Look out for my wagon.

18:48.564 --> 18:51.650
"Dear Ms. Abbott,
Donald was a very good boy.

18:51.817 --> 18:54.111
He's fast asleep.

18:54.486 --> 18:57.323
So I went home. Mrs. Murphy."

18:57.948 --> 18:59.408
I'll get you some candy.

18:59.575 --> 19:02.036
- I know where Aunt Susie hides it.
- Wait a second.

19:02.202 --> 19:04.747
- You think your aunt will be back soon?
- Oh, sure.

19:04.913 --> 19:07.875
What do you mean, "oh, sure"?
How do you know?

19:08.042 --> 19:10.169
Well, she lives here.

19:11.587 --> 19:13.756
You know, sometimes he talks like you.

19:25.976 --> 19:27.561
Look, fellas...

19:27.728 --> 19:32.691
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
I don't want you to think I'd walk out...

19:32.900 --> 19:36.737
Well, you gotta stay here with the kid
anyhow and talk to his aunt and...

19:36.945 --> 19:40.532
Well, I got a date with a girl,
and there's no sense in all of us just...

19:40.699 --> 19:44.453
Well, that's great. That's just dandy.

19:44.620 --> 19:48.165
He's got a date with a girl. What's he
think I've got a date with, a duck?

19:48.666 --> 19:50.709
Goodbye. Thanks, fellas.

19:51.418 --> 19:53.837
Brooklyn, I'm blowing,
the baby's all yours.

19:54.004 --> 19:56.090
Joe. Hey, Joe!

19:56.298 --> 19:58.801
You can't leave me here,
what about my being a wolf?

19:58.968 --> 20:02.054
- You promised me.
- You promised you'd talk to Aunt Susie.

20:02.221 --> 20:07.101
If you don't help me, what will I do?
What will become of me?

20:10.938 --> 20:13.732
Okay. Okay.

20:21.115 --> 20:23.367
Who's he calling?

20:23.534 --> 20:25.452
A girl.

20:26.829 --> 20:29.498
Lola, baby.

20:30.290 --> 20:31.834
Forgotten you?

20:32.001 --> 20:33.919
Oh, honey.

20:34.086 --> 20:37.006
With the picture of you
I've got in my mind?

20:37.172 --> 20:40.968
Why, even across the phone,
I can see every...

20:43.262 --> 20:45.139
Look, let me tell you what happened.

20:45.306 --> 20:49.435
- I found a kid that was lost.
- Joe, I wasn't lost.

20:52.229 --> 20:55.691
So I had to take him home.
I won't be long.

20:57.776 --> 21:03.532
As long as I get there?
Oh, honey, you know I'll get there.

21:07.036 --> 21:09.955
Look, we better talk
about that later, huh?

21:10.164 --> 21:13.792
- Yeah, goodbye.
- What are you going to talk about later?

21:15.377 --> 21:17.087
Things, sailor. Things.

21:17.254 --> 21:19.006
You'll understand when you get older.

21:19.173 --> 21:24.470
- Everybody keeps saying that to me.
- Yeah, they used to say that to me too.

21:24.637 --> 21:27.556
Well, did you understand
when you got older?

21:27.681 --> 21:29.391
Nope.

21:29.933 --> 21:32.269
I wonder what could be keeping
that Aunt Susie.

21:32.436 --> 21:34.688
What can an old lady
be doing out this late?

21:51.330 --> 21:53.999
Susan, don't you wish
that you were up there?

21:54.166 --> 21:58.087
I've never heard his voice sound so
beautiful. There's something about him.

21:58.253 --> 22:02.758
He always gets so much from a singer.
I'd give anything to work with him.

22:38.335 --> 22:40.421
Cut it! Print that.

22:40.629 --> 22:43.757
Okay, children, you go home now
and thanks very much for the day.

22:43.924 --> 22:45.718
No callback.

22:47.845 --> 22:49.179
Good night.

22:49.346 --> 22:51.765
- Mr. Iturbi, I...
- Good night, Susie.

22:51.932 --> 22:53.267
Good night, Tom. I...

22:53.434 --> 22:55.769
- How's that for camera?
- Right on the nose.

22:55.936 --> 22:58.856
Tell me, Bill, when are we going
to shoot the boogie-woogie?

23:03.235 --> 23:05.696
- Good night. Thanks a lot.
- Good night, dear.

23:05.863 --> 23:08.657
- Good night.
- Good night.

23:27.843 --> 23:29.595
Hi, Aunt Susie.

23:33.974 --> 23:37.978
Well, what got you home so early,
your feet give out?

23:38.771 --> 23:40.939
- What?
- Dames like you kill me.

23:41.106 --> 23:43.233
Don't you ever think of anybody
but yourself?

23:43.400 --> 23:47.279
Leaving the little kid alone while you're
out chasing around, having a big time.

23:47.446 --> 23:49.782
Would you mind telling me
just who you are

23:49.948 --> 23:51.408
and what you're doing here?

23:51.617 --> 23:54.495
I'm a guy the police called
when they picked this kid up

23:54.662 --> 23:56.830
wandering around the boulevard,
that's all.

23:56.997 --> 23:59.667
That wouldn't interest you,
so if you step aside, lady...

23:59.833 --> 24:02.878
- Well, just a moment. I don't...
- Don't apologize.

24:03.045 --> 24:05.756
Just clear the deck.
Come on, Brooklyn.

24:06.131 --> 24:08.092
But I...

24:08.258 --> 24:09.677
- Bye.
- Aunt Susie.

24:09.843 --> 24:13.597
- But, Aunt Susie...
- Joe. Hey, Joe. Listen, the kid's crying.

24:13.764 --> 24:16.892
Well, if I had to live
with a dame like that, I'd cry too.

24:17.059 --> 24:18.811
I thought she was sort of nice.

24:18.978 --> 24:21.647
A dame that leaves a kid
alone that way ain't nice.

24:21.814 --> 24:24.233
Wait a minute, please.
You didn't give me a chance.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.068
- Donald explained and...
- Okay, okay.

24:26.235 --> 24:28.112
It was all a mistake, and you're sorry.

24:28.278 --> 24:30.322
But my pal and I got plans
for the night.

24:30.489 --> 24:33.033
- We'd like to get going.
- I haven't got a thing to do.

24:33.200 --> 24:37.538
Well, I thought, if you didn't mind,
that you could come back for a while.

24:37.788 --> 24:40.582
It's Donald, he's so upset
and it's way past his bedtime.

24:40.749 --> 24:44.295
Well, sure we will.
We didn't even say goodbye.

24:46.046 --> 24:48.215
Is something wrong, Joe?

24:55.055 --> 24:56.807
I thought you'd gone.

24:56.974 --> 24:59.601
Hey, hey, sailor, what is this?
What's with you?

24:59.768 --> 25:01.645
You forgot about me.

25:01.812 --> 25:06.191
About what you promised.
You know, the letter.

25:06.817 --> 25:09.445
Oh, sure, the letter.

25:09.611 --> 25:11.113
You see, it's this way.

25:11.280 --> 25:14.825
The kid here wanted to join the Navy,
but I told him about the rule.

25:14.992 --> 25:18.579
You know, the rule about needing a
letter from your folks saying it's okay.

25:18.746 --> 25:21.123
Donald thought
if Joe asked you for the letter...

25:21.290 --> 25:24.293
Oh, Donald, suppose you and I
talk about that in the morning.

25:24.752 --> 25:28.797
If you give it to me now,
I can go right with Joe.

25:28.964 --> 25:31.091
You want me to go with you, don't you?

25:32.676 --> 25:35.054
Well, sure, kid, but...

25:35.638 --> 25:37.931
Wait a second,
there are a couple of things

25:38.098 --> 25:40.893
you need beside the letter,
you gotta have a...

25:41.852 --> 25:43.896
Can you read and write?

25:45.898 --> 25:48.609
No, he can't.
He plays hooky all the time.

25:48.776 --> 25:50.819
You mean to say
you can't read and write?

25:50.986 --> 25:53.197
You think the Navy takes dopes?

25:53.364 --> 25:54.698
Not ever?

25:56.200 --> 26:00.788
Well, maybe sometimes. But even the
dopes have to be able to read and write.

26:00.954 --> 26:03.540
No, I'm sorry, kid, it's just no soap.

26:03.874 --> 26:06.919
Joe, now what will I do?

26:11.256 --> 26:15.094
Well, the first thing you gotta do,
you gotta go to school and study hard.

26:15.302 --> 26:17.262
Before you know it,
you won't be a dope.

26:17.471 --> 26:20.432
Now, young man,
how about going to bed, huh?

26:20.933 --> 26:25.270
All right,
but I want Joe to put me to bed.

26:25.437 --> 26:26.772
Oh, really, Donald.

26:26.939 --> 26:30.317
We can't keep these gentlemen any
longer, they have other things to do.

26:30.484 --> 26:32.695
No, they haven't. They're on leave.

26:32.861 --> 26:35.823
We'd be very happy to put him to bed,
wouldn't we, Joe?

26:35.990 --> 26:38.909
Oh, thank you,
but you've done enough already.

26:40.953 --> 26:42.287
Joe?

26:45.082 --> 26:48.460
Okay, okay, but no stalling.

26:50.421 --> 26:53.590
Come on, you helper, you.

26:55.551 --> 26:58.679
<i>Anchors aweigh, my boy</i>

26:59.221 --> 27:01.515
<i>Anchors aweigh</i>

27:03.934 --> 27:06.645
Hey, hit the sack, sailor.
Get in there.

27:07.438 --> 27:10.482
Joe, you're coming back
to see me, promise?

27:10.649 --> 27:13.986
Sure, sure, sure, that's a deal.
Come on, now, get in bed. Come on.

27:14.153 --> 27:18.907
- All set?
- No, I always get sung to sleep.

27:20.659 --> 27:22.911
Look what wants to join the Navy.

27:23.078 --> 27:26.248
Hey, listen, bub, do you think
anybody sings us sailors to sleep?

27:26.415 --> 27:28.250
But I'm not in the Navy yet.

27:28.417 --> 27:31.211
So it's all right for me to be sung to.

27:31.795 --> 27:34.673
Well, he's right. He's right.

27:35.132 --> 27:36.884
All right.

27:37.051 --> 27:38.385
You sing to him.

27:38.552 --> 27:41.847
After all, you're the choirmaster
around here, not me.

27:42.014 --> 27:43.599
Oh, Joe.

27:43.766 --> 27:46.268
I told you that
in the strictest of confidence.

27:46.477 --> 27:49.355
And you promised never to bring it up.

28:05.663 --> 28:08.457
<i>Lullaby</i>

28:08.666 --> 28:11.460
<i>And good night</i>

28:12.711 --> 28:18.676
<i>With roses bedight</i>

28:19.760 --> 28:23.222
<i>Bright angels</i>

28:23.389 --> 28:29.520
<i>Around my darling</i>

28:30.354 --> 28:33.065
<i>Shall stand</i>

28:33.482 --> 28:38.153
<i>Lay thee down now</i>

28:38.320 --> 28:40.656
<i>And rest</i>

28:41.240 --> 28:45.369
<i>May thy slumber</i>

28:46.078 --> 28:48.789
<i>Be blessed</i>

28:49.331 --> 28:53.794
<i>Lay thee down now</i>

28:53.961 --> 28:56.422
<i>And rest</i>

28:57.381 --> 29:00.801
<i>May thy slumber</i>

29:01.427 --> 29:05.514
<i>Be blessed</i>

29:25.659 --> 29:28.871
- They're asleep.
- Your friend too?

29:29.788 --> 29:32.041
Well, I made some coffee.

29:33.250 --> 29:36.754
Oh, you shouldn't have.
I mean, it's swell, but...

29:36.920 --> 29:38.714
Oh, it's nothing.

29:43.802 --> 29:45.471
Is something wrong?

29:45.638 --> 29:47.514
Oh, no.

29:49.016 --> 29:51.435
- Well, did you have a nice nap?
- Come on, Brooklyn.

29:51.602 --> 29:54.563
- But I have coffee and sandwiches.
- Sorry, gotta blow. Thanks.

29:54.730 --> 29:57.274
- Well, you've been awful nice.
- Forget it. So long.

29:57.441 --> 29:59.151
Goodbye. Thanks. Thanks again.

30:00.277 --> 30:03.656
Hey, Joe, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

30:03.822 --> 30:05.491
I know you're not gonna like this.

30:05.658 --> 30:07.493
Remember what you were gonna do for me?

30:07.660 --> 30:11.789
About getting a girl, I mean.
I've seen the one I want.

30:13.707 --> 30:17.711
- Oh, no. No, Brooklyn.
- But, Joe, you promised me.

30:17.878 --> 30:20.214
Okay, I promised you,
but not Aunt Susie.

30:20.381 --> 30:23.008
I didn't promise you Aunt Susie.

30:28.472 --> 30:30.182
Good night.

30:37.398 --> 30:41.485
But, Lola, it's not that late.
It's never that late.

30:41.652 --> 30:45.614
Oh, baby, I know you're tired, but...

30:45.781 --> 30:47.992
What do you mean, it's for my sake?

30:48.158 --> 30:51.036
Well, honey,
I wouldn't be disappointed in you.

30:51.203 --> 30:54.164
Oh, baby, I couldn't be.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.835
Okay. Okay.

30:58.002 --> 31:01.672
No, no, no, I'm not sore.
I'll be by tomorrow.

31:02.214 --> 31:04.091
Twelve o'clock?

31:04.258 --> 31:06.385
In the morning?

31:07.094 --> 31:10.848
Well, all right,
if that's what you want.

31:12.725 --> 31:14.018
Goodbye.

31:19.273 --> 31:22.776
- Gee, Joe, that's tough.
- Yeah. Hurry up, huh?

31:31.577 --> 31:35.914
- What's the Navy coming to, bud?
- I ask myself that.

31:36.498 --> 31:38.292
Say, Joe...?

31:38.459 --> 31:41.462
Joe, I don't wanna
keep messing up your plans.

31:41.629 --> 31:44.923
What I mean is, we won't have to look
for a girl for me tomorrow.

31:45.090 --> 31:46.592
We've already found Aunt Susan.

31:46.759 --> 31:50.429
Listen, Brooklyn, I didn't save your life
to hand it over to that character.

31:50.596 --> 31:52.473
I'm gonna get you a dame that's a dame.

31:52.640 --> 31:56.226
Right now we gotta find
a place to sleep, so relax. Come on.

31:56.894 --> 31:58.812
Oh, hello, fellas.

32:09.531 --> 32:11.116
Shut up.

32:16.121 --> 32:19.458
- Couple of empties down there, fellas.
- Thanks, pal.

32:19.625 --> 32:21.627
- First night's leave for you guys?
- Yeah.

32:21.794 --> 32:23.128
Well, do you wanna talk?

32:23.295 --> 32:25.714
Sure, but we got in trouble,
we picked up a kid.

32:25.923 --> 32:28.717
Yeah, yeah,
and what a little kid that was.

32:28.926 --> 32:32.179
And what another little kid she had
waiting for us when we got home.

32:32.346 --> 32:35.015
Such trouble we should run into
every night of our life.

32:35.182 --> 32:37.518
- Hiya, Joe.
- Hiya, Pittsburgh, how are you?

32:37.685 --> 32:40.938
- Oh, boy, what a town this is.
- How do you like that?

32:41.105 --> 32:45.442
I walk my feet off all night
and end up with a glass of beer.

32:45.734 --> 32:47.069
You don't live right.

32:47.236 --> 32:50.072
Oh, never in all my life
have I seen such dames.

32:50.239 --> 32:51.573
This blond...

32:51.740 --> 32:54.660
Not that there was anything wrong
with that redhead of yours.

32:55.494 --> 32:59.039
Oh, no. No, no.
She was rather interesting.

32:59.206 --> 33:02.209
Oh, interesting.
You should have seen the kid work.

33:02.751 --> 33:05.713
- I'll tell you, we took the dames home.
- You took them home.

33:05.879 --> 33:08.424
- Little slow at first. A little slow.
- Little slow.

33:08.590 --> 33:10.467
I asked my girl for a kiss.

33:10.634 --> 33:12.761
- She said no.
- Skip the details.

33:12.928 --> 33:15.639
- What happened?
- Well, I'll tell you.

33:15.806 --> 33:19.893
<i>I begged her</i>

33:20.060 --> 33:21.770
That's the way he started.

33:21.937 --> 33:25.858
<i>I pleaded</i>

33:26.025 --> 33:28.736
You should have seen this boy.

33:28.902 --> 33:34.908
<i>I told her,</i>
<i>"Baby, come out of your shell"</i>

33:35.242 --> 33:40.581
<i>I told her,</i>
<i>"Maybe you'll find that it's swell"</i>

33:40.748 --> 33:42.082
What technique.

33:42.249 --> 33:45.544
<i>I argued</i>

33:45.711 --> 33:48.088
I never saw such a stubborn dame
in my whole life.

33:48.255 --> 33:52.301
<i>I threatened</i>

33:52.468 --> 33:54.261
And he's got muscles, too.

33:55.012 --> 34:00.851
<i>I said,</i>
<i>"You can't send me home, not like this"</i>

34:01.018 --> 34:06.148
<i>And I finally got that kiss</i>

34:06.357 --> 34:08.442
Tell them, Brooklyn.
Tell them how it is.

34:08.609 --> 34:13.364
<i>She begged me</i>

34:13.530 --> 34:15.199
- True?
- True. True.

34:15.366 --> 34:19.495
<i>She pleaded</i>

34:19.661 --> 34:21.830
Got down on her bended knee to him!

34:21.996 --> 34:26.627
<i>She told me,</i>
<i>"Baby, come out of your shell"</i>

34:26.793 --> 34:28.963
Oh, this boy was sensational.

34:29.129 --> 34:33.717
<i>She told me,</i>
<i>"Maybe you'll find that it's swell"</i>

34:33.884 --> 34:36.094
- Tell them all, Brooklyn.
- I'm telling them.

34:36.261 --> 34:39.848
<i>She argued</i>

34:40.014 --> 34:41.976
What like a wildcat.

34:42.141 --> 34:46.397
<i>She threatened</i>

34:46.563 --> 34:48.690
Practically drew a gun on the boy.

34:48.857 --> 34:54.071
<i>She said,</i>
<i>"You can't send me home, not like this"</i>

34:54.237 --> 34:55.572
What happened?

34:55.739 --> 35:00.119
<i>She finally got her kiss</i>

35:03.580 --> 35:06.333
- Look at this.
- Give them the floor, boys.

35:08.627 --> 35:10.421
<i>What a time we had tonight</i>

35:26.353 --> 35:28.772
<i>What a dish, what a dream</i>
<i>What a dame</i>

35:31.317 --> 35:33.110
<i>And she lives alone</i>

36:46.850 --> 36:48.477
What time is it?

36:48.644 --> 36:50.813
Oh, it's early yet.

36:51.563 --> 36:53.983
Yeah, I know, but what time is it?

37:04.827 --> 37:06.662
What happened to that clock?

37:10.499 --> 37:12.584
The phone! Where's the phone?

37:23.762 --> 37:28.058
Hello. Hello, Lola. Listen, honey, I...
Well, then, who is it?

37:28.225 --> 37:31.603
Oh, well, listen, this is Joe Brady.
Where's Lola?

37:33.022 --> 37:35.274
Did she leave a message for me?

37:35.441 --> 37:38.902
Never mind what you'd say!
What did Lola say?

37:39.486 --> 37:42.281
Well, that's too bad
about you too, sister...!

37:42.448 --> 37:43.949
Hey. Hey, don't hang up on me.

37:44.116 --> 37:46.952
Let's leave a note, will you?
Tell her I'll call at 10...

37:56.837 --> 37:58.839
Honest, Joe,
I can explain the whole thing.

37:59.006 --> 38:00.758
Just give me a second, I can explain.

38:00.924 --> 38:03.886
You were sleeping like a baby,
and I didn't wanna disturb you.

38:04.053 --> 38:08.098
I know you need your rest very badly.
I know you don't look good unless...

38:08.265 --> 38:10.934
Joe, help! Help! Help!

38:11.101 --> 38:12.561
Joe, help!

38:13.562 --> 38:16.899
It's against the rules, really,
but we thought just this once

38:17.066 --> 38:18.942
we ought to serve breakfast up here.

38:19.109 --> 38:21.487
After all, you've been through so much.

38:22.029 --> 38:23.489
Oh, thanks a lot.

38:23.656 --> 38:25.949
You must appreciate
a buddy like Clarence.

38:26.116 --> 38:28.994
Do you know he wouldn't let anyone
make a sound all morning?

38:29.536 --> 38:32.373
We just crept around like little mice
so as not to wake you.

38:32.539 --> 38:34.249
I never saw such devotion.

38:34.416 --> 38:38.963
Oh, don't think I don't appreciate it.
And don't think I won't pay him back.

38:39.129 --> 38:41.840
Oh, I'm sure Clarence
doesn't expect it.

38:42.007 --> 38:45.052
Oh, no. Really, I don't. I'd hate it.

38:45.219 --> 38:47.429
You poor, poor boy.

38:47.596 --> 38:50.391
Forty-eight days and nights
on a raft.

38:50.599 --> 38:51.934
Isn't this thrilling?

38:52.101 --> 38:54.561
If you want any more coffee,
just let us know.

38:54.770 --> 38:57.272
- And he looks so shy.
- I know, he's so sweet.

39:03.946 --> 39:07.282
Joe. Joe, don't you think you ought
to eat some of this food?

39:07.449 --> 39:09.159
It gets cold very quickly, you know.

39:09.326 --> 39:11.495
Why don't you try the eggs.
They're very good.

39:11.662 --> 39:14.415
Joe, I left you a razor in the shower,
there's a towel...

39:14.581 --> 39:17.334
Clarence, you can wait on me
hand and foot.

39:17.501 --> 39:20.087
You can polish my shoes,
you can be my slave.

39:20.963 --> 39:22.756
But, Clarence

39:23.340 --> 39:26.719
it won't do you any good.

39:26.885 --> 39:30.431
Because I'm not going to help you
with Aunt Susan. Get it?

39:30.597 --> 39:31.974
But, Joe...

39:32.141 --> 39:34.268
Joe, it isn't Aunt Susan, it's Donald.

39:34.435 --> 39:36.562
You promised him
you'd go back to see him.

39:36.729 --> 39:38.897
Why, it's like breaking
the word of honor

39:39.064 --> 39:41.400
of the whole United States Navy.

39:42.568 --> 39:44.278
Clarence

39:44.445 --> 39:47.031
I'm not going back to that house!

39:57.082 --> 39:59.418
Look, I get you a date with her,
it washes us up.

39:59.585 --> 40:01.420
I don't owe you a thing, right?

40:01.587 --> 40:04.923
Okay. Here, take all this stuff.

40:05.090 --> 40:07.259
It'll make an impression.

40:09.970 --> 40:11.847
Let me look at you.

40:16.769 --> 40:19.021
Well, it'll have to do.

40:19.438 --> 40:21.315
Now, try, will you?

40:21.482 --> 40:23.984
- Hello, Aunt Susie.
- Why...

40:24.234 --> 40:27.279
Hello. Won't you come in?

40:27.696 --> 40:30.574
We promised Donald
we'd come back and, well...

40:30.741 --> 40:33.369
Brooklyn spent the whole afternoon
getting him toys.

40:33.535 --> 40:35.788
Oh, that's awfully kind of you.

40:35.955 --> 40:38.624
- Let's put them over here, huh?
- Where's he hiding?

40:38.791 --> 40:41.293
Donald? Oh, he's down in school.

40:41.460 --> 40:43.671
Thanks to you,
he went almost willingly today.

40:43.837 --> 40:45.339
Oh, good.

40:45.506 --> 40:49.677
Say, aren't you a little young
to be bringing up a kid all by yourself?

40:49.843 --> 40:52.805
Well, I'm all the family he has.

40:52.972 --> 40:56.183
His mother died when he was a baby,
and then his father.

40:56.392 --> 41:00.688
His father left us this house,
and that helps quite a lot.

41:01.230 --> 41:02.940
You see, I work, and that keeps me

41:03.107 --> 41:05.275
from being with Donald
as much as I'd like.

41:05.818 --> 41:08.153
I never know when the studio
is going to call me.

41:08.320 --> 41:12.074
- Gee, are you an actress?
- I wanna be a singer.

41:12.241 --> 41:14.660
But right now
I'm doing extra work in the movies.

41:14.827 --> 41:17.121
You ever get a chance
to do any singing?

41:17.288 --> 41:20.457
No, but there are some
really great musicians.

41:20.624 --> 41:24.545
There's Stokowski and JosÃ© Iturbi and
people like that who work in pictures.

41:24.712 --> 41:27.840
There's always a chance that
I might get to sing for one of them.

41:28.007 --> 41:30.217
- Any luck so far?
- No.

41:31.343 --> 41:34.638
That's awful. That's terrible.

41:34.805 --> 41:36.890
Thank you, Clarence.

41:37.391 --> 41:40.185
Oh, I didn't realize it was so late.

41:40.352 --> 41:44.398
Please forgive me, but I really
should run up and dress now.

41:44.690 --> 41:47.276
I'm sorry you missed Donald,
he'll be disappointed.

41:47.443 --> 41:51.572
Well, as a matter of fact, we didn't
come just to see Donald, we...

41:52.072 --> 41:56.410
Clarence, I'm going to tell her
whether you like it or not.

41:56.619 --> 41:58.746
Clarence didn't sleep all night,
you know.

41:58.912 --> 42:02.166
And do you know why?
Because he was thinking about you.

42:02.333 --> 42:03.917
Why, Clarence.

42:04.126 --> 42:07.588
I told him that you'd understand
how it is, getting to a strange town

42:07.755 --> 42:09.298
when you've been away at sea.

42:09.465 --> 42:11.967
"She'll understand," I said,
"how important it is

42:12.134 --> 42:15.054
when you finally do get
a little leave, to meet someone..."

42:15.220 --> 42:19.558
Clarence, do you wanna take me out?
Is that what all this is leading up to?

42:19.725 --> 42:22.936
- "She's a girl with a heart," I said...
- Well, I'd love to.

42:24.188 --> 42:25.522
Honest?

42:27.107 --> 42:30.402
I wish I could make it tonight,
but I'm busy.

42:30.986 --> 42:32.321
- Boyfriend?
- Oh, no.

42:32.488 --> 42:34.365
Just someone I met at the studio.

42:34.531 --> 42:37.368
He should be here now,
so I really have to run up and dress.

42:37.534 --> 42:39.828
You did mean what you said
about my calling you?

42:39.995 --> 42:43.415
Well, of course. Any night that
you're free, you just give me a ring.

42:43.707 --> 42:47.127
Goodbye.
And thank you again for Donald.

42:47.294 --> 42:48.921
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

42:51.840 --> 42:54.885
You know, I bet she's not so bad.

42:55.052 --> 42:57.262
Gee, I'm glad you like her.

42:57.429 --> 43:00.391
I didn't say I liked her,
I said she wasn't bad.

43:00.557 --> 43:03.435
Yeah, but coming from you.

43:42.308 --> 43:46.520
Well, I guess if Aunt Susie likes him,
he must be okay.

43:47.730 --> 43:49.898
Gee, that's a nice car, isn't it?

43:50.065 --> 43:52.776
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Aren't you even worried?

43:52.943 --> 43:56.322
Once she goes out with him,
she'll turn up her nose at any place we...

43:56.488 --> 43:58.157
I mean, that you could take her to.

43:58.324 --> 44:01.535
Look, this means nothing to me,
I'm telling you for your own good.

44:01.702 --> 44:04.496
Once she goes out with him,
brother, you're dead.

44:04.663 --> 44:07.374
- Gee, you think so, Joe?
- Sure.

44:09.251 --> 44:11.879
There isn't anything I can do about it.

44:12.838 --> 44:16.175
Brooklyn, there's always something
you can do about everything.

44:16.342 --> 44:17.801
Come on.

44:29.521 --> 44:31.982
Did you want to see Ms. Abbott?

44:33.525 --> 44:37.029
- She's upstairs dressing, I'll call her.
- Oh, I wouldn't do that, bud.

44:37.196 --> 44:40.574
Susie hates to be bothered
when she's dressing.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.292
Yeah, she hates it.

45:03.138 --> 45:06.934
- Something wrong, jack?
- Oh, no. Nothing at all.

45:07.142 --> 45:10.354
Well, then squat someplace, jack,
you're making me nervous.

45:19.488 --> 45:21.156
My name is Bertram Kraler.

45:22.908 --> 45:24.618
Bertram?

45:30.040 --> 45:33.043
Are you good friends of Ms. Abbott's?

45:35.671 --> 45:38.215
You might call it that.

45:41.969 --> 45:44.555
- Are you?
- I just met her.

45:44.722 --> 45:46.223
I'm taking her to dinner.

45:46.390 --> 45:49.226
Maybe you know
what you're doing, Bertram

45:49.393 --> 45:52.313
but I don't think
the boys will like it.

45:54.815 --> 45:57.776
I beg your pardon? The boys?

45:58.902 --> 46:03.073
The Navy. I don't think they're
gonna like Susie branching out this way.

46:04.533 --> 46:06.493
But I don't quite...

46:06.660 --> 46:08.912
Ms. Abbott knows
a great many Navy men?

46:10.956 --> 46:14.877
Maybe some she doesn't know,
say a dozen or two maybe.

46:16.545 --> 46:18.172
It's a funny thing.

46:18.714 --> 46:20.716
You get onboard a new ship

46:20.883 --> 46:25.054
don't know a soul,
kind of lonesome even.

46:25.220 --> 46:30.517
Then at chow somebody says,
"Anybody seen Susie lately?"

46:30.684 --> 46:33.270
And right away
everybody's talking about her.

46:33.896 --> 46:36.899
You know, it's kind of homey,
if you see what I mean.

46:37.066 --> 46:42.988
Yes. Yes, I do. But, well,
she seems such a quiet girl.

46:44.490 --> 46:46.784
Susie? Quiet?

46:52.539 --> 46:55.668
Well, that's not what the song says
when the boys sing about her.

46:55.834 --> 46:57.795
They never even mention
the word "quiet."

46:57.962 --> 47:00.631
They sing about her?
The Navy's got a song about her?

47:00.798 --> 47:03.300
- Sure.
- I don't believe it.

47:03.467 --> 47:08.138
- Well, okay.
- All right, let me hear it.

47:08.555 --> 47:13.560
Well, I don't think you'd better, Bertram.
It's strictly for sailors, see?

47:13.727 --> 47:15.688
Yeah. Yeah, it's not
your type of a song.

47:15.854 --> 47:18.190
I insist on hearing it.

47:20.567 --> 47:23.070
All right, Brooklyn,
if the man insists, let's play.

47:23.237 --> 47:25.406
But, Joe, I don't think we ought to.

47:25.572 --> 47:30.160
- Go ahead. Play that Susie song.
- Well, you start and I'll find you a key.

47:30.327 --> 47:33.831
<i>If you knew Susie</i>
<i>Like we know Susie</i>

47:34.039 --> 47:37.251
<i>Oh, oh, oh, what a gal!</i>

47:37.459 --> 47:41.088
<i>She's not so choosy</i>
<i>No, not our Susie</i>

47:41.255 --> 47:44.758
<i>- Oh, oh...</i>
<i>- Susie is a lollapaloozie</i>

47:46.260 --> 47:49.680
<i>- When Susie kisses</i>
<i>- It never fails</i>

47:49.888 --> 47:51.223
<i>When Susie kisses</i>

47:51.390 --> 47:52.933
<i>She takes the wind</i>
<i>Right out of your sails</i>

47:53.100 --> 47:56.145
<i>- So in conclusion</i>
<i>- Beware of Susion</i>

47:56.312 --> 47:59.440
<i>Oh, oh, oh, what a gal!</i>

48:01.317 --> 48:04.320
<i>S is for sincerity</i>

48:05.112 --> 48:07.489
<i>Which she's got none of</i>

48:07.656 --> 48:11.869
<i>U is for you-know-what-l-mean</i>

48:12.453 --> 48:15.247
<i>- S is for...</i>
<i>- Sincerity</i>

48:15.414 --> 48:19.668
<i>Which she's got none of</i>

48:19.835 --> 48:25.382
<i>I is for the Irish in her smile</i>

48:27.593 --> 48:34.016
<i>Her Irish smile</i>

48:34.767 --> 48:39.355
<i>E is for her eagerness to please us</i>

48:39.521 --> 48:41.523
<i>That is how she won her Navy E</i>

48:42.858 --> 48:45.319
<i>Put them all together</i>

48:45.527 --> 48:51.116
<i>They spell Susie</i>

48:51.325 --> 48:54.495
<i>The sweetheart of the boys at sea</i>

48:54.662 --> 48:57.414
<i>Oh, that Susie</i>
<i>She's a doozy</i>

48:57.581 --> 49:00.292
<i>She's not choosy</i>
<i>You won't lose-y</i>

49:00.501 --> 49:03.337
<i>- Don't care who-sie</i>
<i>- I mean you-sie</i>

49:03.504 --> 49:06.674
<i>You'll get woozy</i>
<i>After just one date with Susie</i>

49:06.840 --> 49:09.051
<i>When you take her home about 10</i>

49:09.218 --> 49:12.471
<i>Another gob is waiting there</i>
<i>To take our Susie out again</i>

49:12.638 --> 49:15.182
<i>- So in conclusie</i>
<i>- Beware of Susie</i>

49:15.349 --> 49:17.059
<i>She belongs to you and you and me</i>

49:17.226 --> 49:18.268
<i>And the U.S. Navy</i>

49:18.477 --> 49:20.980
<i>S, S-U, S-U-S</i>

49:21.146 --> 49:27.403
<i>S- U-S-I, S-U-S-l-E</i>

49:29.446 --> 49:31.532
Well, well, well.

49:31.699 --> 49:34.451
I don't know what's the matter
with him, do you, Brooklyn?

49:34.618 --> 49:35.995
Yes, and I wish I didn't.

49:36.161 --> 49:38.914
Will you please tell Ms. Abbott
that Mr. Kraler regrets...

49:39.081 --> 49:42.209
Regrets what?
What on earth is the matter?

49:43.836 --> 49:46.297
What are you two doing here?

49:48.465 --> 49:50.342
Mr. Kraler regrets what?

49:50.509 --> 49:52.636
I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding.

49:52.803 --> 49:56.056
Knowing your taste as I do now,
I'm sure the kind of evening

49:56.223 --> 49:58.017
I'd planned wouldn't interest you.

49:58.183 --> 50:01.395
S-U-S, S-U...

50:01.562 --> 50:03.439
But, Mr. Kraler, I...

50:07.484 --> 50:09.361
What did you say to him?

50:09.528 --> 50:11.864
- What difference does it make?
- I'd like to know.

50:12.031 --> 50:14.241
- What did you say to him?
- I kind of figured

50:14.408 --> 50:17.828
you were stuck with him and...
It wasn't Brooklyn, really. It was me.

50:17.995 --> 50:20.664
I don't understand why you think
I was stuck with him.

50:20.831 --> 50:23.917
Well, I thought that you'd be glad
to get him off your hands.

50:24.084 --> 50:27.630
- I thought you'd be grateful if I...
- And you thought I'd be grateful.

50:28.172 --> 50:32.301
Well, yes, maybe, I...
I mean, if I were a dame and that...

50:32.509 --> 50:36.305
If you were a dame and for one solid year
you'd been trying to get someplace

50:36.472 --> 50:40.059
and you met a man whose mother
was in the philharmonic society

50:40.225 --> 50:43.020
and who could introduce you
to very important people.

50:43.187 --> 50:45.606
People like Iturbi. I mean

50:45.773 --> 50:49.068
I think this is the meanest
and the cruelest...

50:50.277 --> 50:53.155
Don't cry. Please, don't cry.

50:57.326 --> 50:58.994
Aunt Susie.

50:59.161 --> 51:02.414
- Oh, go away.
- No.

51:02.623 --> 51:07.127
I'm sorry. I had no right to brush
Bertram off without your okay.

51:08.420 --> 51:11.548
Honest, I'm sorry. Please don't cry.

51:12.800 --> 51:14.635
Oh, I know you didn't mean it

51:14.802 --> 51:18.639
but it's just that
I might never get another chance.

51:26.271 --> 51:29.942
We've got a better chance for you.
That is, Clarence has.

51:30.109 --> 51:32.861
It's... Well, it's a surprise.

51:33.028 --> 51:36.740
- Well, what kind of a surprise?
- Oh, he'd never tell you.

51:36.907 --> 51:38.742
That's Clarence all over.

51:38.909 --> 51:41.328
You know what he did
before he went into the Navy?

51:41.495 --> 51:43.372
- He was the assistant...
- Joe!

51:43.539 --> 51:45.207
Joe, remember what you promised me.

51:45.416 --> 51:48.961
Okay. At least I can tell her
you were in music, can't I?

51:49.128 --> 51:50.754
And he was a big shot too.

51:50.921 --> 51:53.632
Why, when you went upstairs
to change, he said to me:

51:53.799 --> 51:56.385
"You know, if meeting Iturbi
would do her any good

51:56.552 --> 51:59.763
well, after all,
he's a friend of mine and..."

51:59.930 --> 52:03.100
- He is, Clarence?
- They're pals.

52:03.267 --> 52:06.395
As a matter of fact,
I once even heard Iturbi say:

52:06.562 --> 52:10.357
"It is I who should be grateful
to you, Clarence."

52:10.941 --> 52:13.861
Remember? At San Diego?

52:14.069 --> 52:16.447
Well, you know what Clarence did?

52:17.990 --> 52:20.993
He just went to the phone
and called his pal Iturbi

52:21.160 --> 52:25.456
and arranged for you
to have an audition, that's all.

52:27.791 --> 52:29.877
Oh, Clarence, you didn't.

52:30.044 --> 52:33.505
Well, when...? When did he say?

52:34.632 --> 52:37.301
- When?
- Go ahead, tell her when, Clarence.

52:39.303 --> 52:42.056
Saturday. Saturday morning at 11:15.

52:42.222 --> 52:44.058
Oh, Clarence.

52:47.144 --> 52:48.479
I'm sorry.

52:48.646 --> 52:53.484
It's just that it's the nicest thing
that anyone has ever done for me and...

52:53.651 --> 52:55.945
What did he say?
What did you tell him about me?

52:56.111 --> 52:58.030
- What does he...?
- Look, I've got an idea.

52:58.197 --> 52:59.531
No.

52:59.698 --> 53:02.368
He has many things to tell you,
why don't you go out

53:02.534 --> 53:04.119
have dinner and talk it over.

53:04.286 --> 53:08.332
- I think that'd be a wonderful idea.
- Well, you come too.

53:08.499 --> 53:09.833
- Please do, Joe.
- Look

53:10.000 --> 53:12.920
you haven't got a thing to do
until 10:00, remember?

53:13.087 --> 53:14.672
- Joe!
- Hiya, sailor.

53:14.838 --> 53:17.549
You came! You came!

53:17.716 --> 53:20.135
Don't tell me you've been
at school all this time?

53:20.302 --> 53:25.683
Sure, I stayed to tell the teacher
what I had to study for the Navy.

53:25.849 --> 53:27.810
She sure doesn't know much.

53:27.977 --> 53:29.979
You mean you kept the teacher
until now?

53:30.145 --> 53:32.648
- Of course. Hiya, Clarence.
- Hiya, Donald.

53:32.815 --> 53:35.234
Come on, I'm gonna march you
over to Mrs. Murphy's.

53:35.401 --> 53:36.944
- We're going out.
- I'll come too.

53:37.111 --> 53:39.697
- Oh, no, you won't.
- But I gotta talk to Joe.

53:39.863 --> 53:41.782
You can just talk to Joe
some other time.

53:41.949 --> 53:44.493
- When? Tomorrow?
- Sure. Sure.

53:44.618 --> 53:46.287
Will you come in school to see me?

53:46.704 --> 53:50.708
- Aunt Susie is coming tomorrow.
- Okay, it's a promise.

53:52.876 --> 53:54.878
Come along, darling.

53:55.045 --> 53:57.589
Hey, you dope.
You wanted a date with her, didn't you?

53:57.756 --> 54:00.426
Wanted to be alone?
What do you wanna drag me along for?

54:00.592 --> 54:04.430
Because I don't know
what Iturbi said to me on the phone.

54:52.019 --> 54:53.437
It's a wishing well.

54:53.604 --> 54:56.565
Every time I pass by,
I always toss a coin in and make a wish.

54:57.858 --> 55:00.069
Thanks to you, I got my wish.

55:00.235 --> 55:02.780
Oh, but should I still toss a coin in?

55:04.907 --> 55:06.784
You better play it safe.

55:18.003 --> 55:19.546
Now it's your turn.

55:19.713 --> 55:23.592
No, no, not me. I got a theory called
"Wishing Don't Make It So."

55:23.801 --> 55:26.845
You decide what you want
and then you go out and get it.

55:27.012 --> 55:29.014
Come on.

55:33.018 --> 55:36.563
- Oh, no, not again enchiladas.
- What else?

55:36.730 --> 55:39.149
Enchiladas for all of us
and all the trimmings.

55:39.358 --> 55:40.985
All right.

55:41.151 --> 55:45.364
- Now, listen, gentlemen, this is on me.
- But you can't spend your money on us.

55:45.531 --> 55:47.741
- I'm not.
- What are you gonna do? Wash dishes?

55:47.908 --> 55:49.952
- Polish the silver?
- Scrub the floors?

55:50.119 --> 55:53.872
That sounds reasonable.
Now, listen, you stay right here

55:54.039 --> 55:56.709
and no matter what happens, be brave.

55:58.502 --> 56:01.213
- You're all set, I'm gonna go.
- You can't leave me alone.

56:01.380 --> 56:03.716
How are you gonna get to know her
if you're never alone with her?

56:03.882 --> 56:05.801
Besides, I wanna phone Lola.

56:07.720 --> 56:10.848
We have Ms. Susan Abbott
to sing for you.

56:38.208 --> 56:40.544
<i>Jealousy</i>

56:40.711 --> 56:44.298
<i>You constantly hurt me</i>

56:44.465 --> 56:48.010
<i>I sometimes wonder</i>

56:48.177 --> 56:52.264
<i>If this spell that I'm under</i>

56:52.431 --> 56:56.226
<i>Can only be a melody</i>

56:56.435 --> 56:59.980
<i>For I know no one but me</i>

57:00.189 --> 57:03.400
<i>Has won your heart</i>

57:04.109 --> 57:09.198
<i>But when the music starts</i>

57:09.406 --> 57:11.742
<i>My peace departs</i>

57:11.951 --> 57:17.957
<i>From the moment they play</i>
<i>That languorous strain</i>

57:18.207 --> 57:21.377
<i>And we surrender</i>

57:21.543 --> 57:25.464
<i>To all its charm once again</i>

57:25.673 --> 57:28.717
<i>This jealousy</i>

57:29.468 --> 57:32.972
<i>That tortures me</i>

57:33.180 --> 57:36.892
<i>Is ecstasy</i>

57:37.059 --> 57:42.481
<i>Mysterious pain</i>

57:42.690 --> 57:48.821
<i>We dance to a tango of love</i>

57:49.446 --> 57:55.953
<i>Your heart beats with mine</i>
<i>As we sway</i>

57:56.328 --> 58:02.209
<i>Your eyes give the answer</i>
<i>I'm dreaming of</i>

58:03.252 --> 58:06.964
<i>That soft word</i>
<i>Your cruel lips</i>

58:07.131 --> 58:12.052
<i>Will never say</i>

58:12.261 --> 58:18.267
<i>I fear that the music will end</i>

58:18.851 --> 58:25.274
<i>And shatter the spell it may lend</i>

58:25.733 --> 58:29.028
<i>To make me believe</i>

58:29.236 --> 58:33.282
<i>When your eyes just deceive</i>

58:33.490 --> 58:40.372
<i>And it's only the tango you love</i>

58:59.183 --> 59:03.270
<i>To make me believe</i>

59:03.437 --> 59:08.275
<i>When your eyes just deceive</i>

59:08.484 --> 59:13.739
<i>And it's only the tango</i>

59:13.948 --> 59:20.829
<i>You love</i>

59:30.339 --> 59:33.217
- Where is the phone?
- Oh, right up here.

59:34.343 --> 59:37.096
Gee, I thought
you were wonderful, honest.

59:37.596 --> 59:39.181
Joe went to make a phone call.

59:39.390 --> 59:41.350
- He's a busy guy.
- He is?

59:41.517 --> 59:43.560
He's the biggest wolf
in the whole Navy.

59:43.769 --> 59:46.355
Yeah, they call him the sea wolf.

59:47.022 --> 59:49.650
Well, that's what they call him.

59:50.985 --> 59:55.281
Clarence, do you realize
that I don't know anything about you?

59:55.447 --> 59:58.534
I mean, other than you're very nice

59:59.576 --> 01:00:01.453
but tell me about yourself.

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:05.207
I'm fine.

01:00:06.292 --> 01:00:09.461
Well, what sort of work
do you do in the Navy?

01:00:10.004 --> 01:00:13.757
- Gun crew.
- Is it interesting?

01:00:14.216 --> 01:00:16.218
It's keen.

01:00:33.068 --> 01:00:35.654
- Well, we missed you.
- Susita

01:00:35.821 --> 01:00:39.408
it was not bad this time.
It was great.

01:00:39.575 --> 01:00:41.285
Well, I have wonderful news for you.

01:00:41.493 --> 01:00:44.997
Guess for whom I'm going to sing
this Saturday morning at 11:15.

01:00:45.247 --> 01:00:48.834
JosÃ© Iturbi. The JosÃ© Iturbi.

01:00:49.877 --> 01:00:52.296
- No.
- Yes.

01:00:52.504 --> 01:00:56.258
Clarence is one of his best friends,
and he arranged it for me.

01:00:56.467 --> 01:01:00.512
Wait, I must run. I must tell Mama.
I must tell Pedro. I must tell Manuel.

01:01:00.679 --> 01:01:03.182
- I must tell everybody.
- But it's only an audition...

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:06.685
It's no use, it'll be all over
the street in five minutes.

01:01:08.896 --> 01:01:10.939
Susan, you think
you ought to tell people?

01:01:11.106 --> 01:01:12.775
I know you have a wonderful voice...

01:01:12.942 --> 01:01:15.569
Yeah, but what if everything
didn't go just right?

01:01:15.778 --> 01:01:19.448
Well, you've given me the opportunity,
and I want everyone to know about it.

01:01:19.657 --> 01:01:24.453
If I fail, it's... Well, it's right
that they should know that too.

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.206
Yeah, I guess she's right.

01:01:27.748 --> 01:01:31.126
Say, Clarence,
why don't you dance with Susan.

01:01:31.961 --> 01:01:37.007
Sure. Do you wanna?
I mean, I'd like to if you'd like to.

01:01:37.174 --> 01:01:38.509
I'd love to.

01:01:49.395 --> 01:01:51.438
I only know how to waltz

01:01:52.314 --> 01:01:53.816
and this isn't a...

01:01:55.234 --> 01:01:59.196
Well, that's too bad.
Maybe they'll play one later on.

01:02:17.881 --> 01:02:21.218
You know, you're a strange team,
you two.

01:02:21.385 --> 01:02:24.638
Clarence is so shy

01:02:24.847 --> 01:02:26.598
and you're so...

01:02:28.017 --> 01:02:31.812
Well, you're a sea wolf.
Clarence told me you were.

01:02:37.776 --> 01:02:41.030
Yeah, well,
dames are plenty crazy about him.

01:02:41.363 --> 01:02:42.823
Nice dames, that is.

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:46.327
And not about you?
Nice dames, that is.

01:02:46.493 --> 01:02:50.664
Well, I'm an altogether different
kind of a guy. You know, I...

01:02:50.831 --> 01:02:53.876
Well, I'm never serious about things

01:02:54.043 --> 01:02:57.004
but, well, Clarence,
he's always on the level.

01:03:02.968 --> 01:03:07.014
All right, all right,
I know I should have tried, but I didn't.

01:03:09.683 --> 01:03:12.061
Okay, so I'm a coward.

01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:16.106
I don't know why, you tell me.

01:03:17.274 --> 01:03:20.903
Gee whiz, why do I freeze
when she looks at me?

01:03:21.236 --> 01:03:24.323
What makes people act this way
about people?

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:28.035
What makes anything?

01:03:29.203 --> 01:03:32.915
<i>What makes the sun set?</i>

01:03:33.165 --> 01:03:36.669
<i>What makes the moon rise?</i>

01:03:36.877 --> 01:03:40.339
<i>What makes the tide</i>
<i>Remember to hide</i>

01:03:40.506 --> 01:03:43.884
<i>And why does it soon rise?</i>

01:03:44.969 --> 01:03:48.555
<i>What makes a star fall?</i>

01:03:48.764 --> 01:03:51.976
<i>Where does it fall to?</i>

01:03:52.476 --> 01:03:56.563
<i>Why does its flight</i>
<i>Make us stop in the night</i>

01:03:56.981 --> 01:04:00.192
<i>And wish as we all do?</i>

01:04:00.943 --> 01:04:08.867
<i>And what holds a cloud together?</i>

01:04:11.036 --> 01:04:17.876
<i>What makes the sky so blue?</i>

01:04:18.711 --> 01:04:22.423
<i>What makes the sun set?</i>

01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:26.218
<i>What makes the moon rise?</i>

01:04:26.427 --> 01:04:30.139
<i>Is it my love</i>

01:04:30.764 --> 01:04:34.435
<i>For you?</i>

01:04:39.231 --> 01:04:47.656
<i>And what holds a cloud together?</i>

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:55.748
<i>And what makes the sky so blue?</i>

01:04:57.583 --> 01:05:01.462
<i>What makes the sun set?</i>

01:05:02.046 --> 01:05:05.424
<i>What makes the moon rise?</i>

01:05:05.633 --> 01:05:08.969
<i>Is it my love</i>

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:16.226
<i>For you?</i>

01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:30.032
Gee, you sing just like a bird.

01:05:30.574 --> 01:05:33.160
- Brooklyn!
- Yeah, how do you know?

01:05:33.369 --> 01:05:37.081
- Flatbush.
- Go on. Greenpoint.

01:05:38.082 --> 01:05:40.334
- How do you like that?
- How do you like that?

01:05:40.501 --> 01:05:43.379
Imagine meeting a dame
all the way from Brooklyn.

01:05:43.587 --> 01:05:46.882
Ain't it a small world?
Like my old lady used to say.

01:05:47.299 --> 01:05:51.303
Hey, mister, you better sit down, huh?
The manager.

01:05:51.929 --> 01:05:56.767
- Gee, are you all alone?
- No, I'm here with a girl. She's dancing.

01:06:01.146 --> 01:06:03.649
Oh, he's my best friend.

01:06:05.025 --> 01:06:07.945
Okay, maybe you know what you're doing.

01:06:08.279 --> 01:06:12.950
She's a swell one, all right, that girl.
And what a voice.

01:06:13.284 --> 01:06:15.744
Yeah, she's wonderful.

01:06:15.953 --> 01:06:18.455
She's just about the loveliest...

01:06:18.664 --> 01:06:21.834
Only, you know something?
I can never talk to her.

01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:24.837
I can never talk to girls at all.
I never know what to say.

01:06:25.004 --> 01:06:27.923
What's the matter with you?
You're talking to me, ain't you?

01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:29.717
Oh, you...

01:06:29.883 --> 01:06:32.845
Oh, I mean... I mean, you're different.
You're from Brooklyn.

01:06:33.095 --> 01:06:36.181
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.603
Most girls are so easy
to figure out, see?

01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:45.941
- They are?
- Yeah, but you are...

01:06:46.692 --> 01:06:50.029
One time you look kind of as if
you knew all the answers

01:06:50.237 --> 01:06:54.158
and then 10 minutes later
you're just like a little kid.

01:06:54.617 --> 01:06:57.536
Just when a guy starts thinking
he ought to buy you a doll

01:06:57.703 --> 01:06:59.747
or an ice cream cone or something

01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:03.959
then all of a sudden
you're all grown up again.

01:07:05.169 --> 01:07:06.920
I am?

01:07:07.838 --> 01:07:09.423
Yeah.

01:07:10.883 --> 01:07:16.138
And everything gets all kind of
mixed up and interesting.

01:07:21.644 --> 01:07:24.730
I mean... Well, that's what Clarence
said about you.

01:07:24.897 --> 01:07:28.025
You know,
he thinks about you all the time.

01:07:28.233 --> 01:07:30.027
He does?

01:07:31.695 --> 01:07:33.197
Yeah.

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:35.991
Yeah.

01:07:36.241 --> 01:07:37.868
All the time.

01:08:06.021 --> 01:08:09.191
I guess I'll be seeing you again
tomorrow night at the restaurant?

01:08:09.358 --> 01:08:14.446
- If you don't mind going back there.
- Oh, I don't mind. It's a swell place.

01:08:16.198 --> 01:08:17.616
Well.

01:08:17.866 --> 01:08:19.576
Well.

01:08:21.578 --> 01:08:23.956
It's been a lovely evening

01:08:24.163 --> 01:08:27.126
and I don't know when
I've been so happy.

01:08:34.383 --> 01:08:36.176
Good night.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.685
Joe, did you hear what she said?
She's never been so happy.

01:08:44.852 --> 01:08:47.062
Yeah, and if you stop to think
for a minute

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:49.564
maybe you'll figure out why.

01:08:52.693 --> 01:08:54.862
- You mean Iturbi?
- Yeah.

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:58.073
Why shouldn't she be happy,
with that big, beautiful audition

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.575
you fixed coming up?

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:29.563
<i>All of a sudden my heart sings</i>

01:09:29.813 --> 01:09:33.776
<i>When I remember little things</i>

01:09:34.068 --> 01:09:37.947
<i>The way you dance</i>
<i>And hold me tight</i>

01:09:38.238 --> 01:09:43.202
<i>The way you kiss</i>
<i>And say good night</i>

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:47.790
<i>The crazy things we say and do</i>

01:09:47.997 --> 01:09:51.877
<i>How fun it is to be with you</i>

01:09:52.627 --> 01:09:57.841
<i>The magic thrill</i>
<i>That's in your touch</i>

01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:03.681
<i>Oh, darling, I love you so much</i>

01:10:04.098 --> 01:10:08.519
<i>The secret way you press my hand</i>

01:10:08.769 --> 01:10:13.482
<i>To let me know you understand</i>

01:10:13.691 --> 01:10:18.237
<i>The wind and rain upon your face</i>

01:10:18.737 --> 01:10:24.285
<i>The breathless world</i>
<i>Of your embrace</i>

01:10:24.493 --> 01:10:29.873
<i>Your little laugh and half-surprise</i>

01:10:30.749 --> 01:10:36.547
<i>The starlight gleaming in your eyes</i>

01:10:36.714 --> 01:10:42.845
<i>Remembering all those little things</i>

01:10:44.221 --> 01:10:45.723
<i>All of a sudden</i>

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:53.272
<i>My heart sings</i>

01:11:06.452 --> 01:11:09.204
Yes, Mr. Banick, I understand.

01:11:10.706 --> 01:11:13.584
You've gotta have a pass
to get in, sailor.

01:11:15.419 --> 01:11:18.881
I'll take care of that right away,
Mr. Banick. Yes, sir.

01:11:24.637 --> 01:11:26.430
- Mr. Iturbi work here?
- Yes.

01:11:26.639 --> 01:11:30.476
- Well, I'd kind of like to see him.
- Is Mr. Iturbi expecting you?

01:11:30.893 --> 01:11:34.438
- Well, not exactly.
- Well, I'm sorry, but it's impossible.

01:11:39.693 --> 01:11:43.155
I gotta talk to him. It's important.
Even just for a minute, can't you?

01:11:43.322 --> 01:11:47.117
Really, there's nothing I can do. He's
very busy. He's on the stage, recording.

01:11:49.745 --> 01:11:52.247
Gentlemen, bar 95, please.

01:11:52.665 --> 01:11:55.584
- Roll it, Jim, please.
- Speed.

01:14:37.997 --> 01:14:41.625
So the admiral went up on deck,
said to him, he said, "Gunner's Mate

01:14:41.792 --> 01:14:44.753
Second Class Joe Brady,
what do you think we should do?"

01:14:44.962 --> 01:14:48.173
So Joe said, "Well, sir..."
Because even in a battle

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:50.843
if you talk to an admiral,
you have to say "sir."

01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:54.596
So Joe said...
Joe! Come on, kids, it's Joe.

01:14:54.763 --> 01:14:56.098
Hi.

01:14:56.265 --> 01:14:59.977
- I was just telling them about you.
- Yeah, so I heard.

01:15:00.185 --> 01:15:03.355
- Where's Aunt Susie? I thought she...
- She had to go to the studio.

01:15:03.522 --> 01:15:07.818
Listen, Joe, I told the kids you'd tell us
all about your adventures.

01:15:10.112 --> 01:15:12.740
Oh, look, I... Honest...

01:15:12.948 --> 01:15:14.992
All right, all right.
Sit down, sit down.

01:15:15.159 --> 01:15:17.119
Oh, boy.

01:15:19.496 --> 01:15:21.999
Tell us how you got your medal.

01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:25.336
All right,
I'll tell you how I got my medal.

01:15:25.586 --> 01:15:27.421
Now, close your eyes

01:15:28.464 --> 01:15:32.718
and try to imagine the most
beautiful day you've ever seen.

01:15:32.841 --> 01:15:35.552
The greenest grass
and the singing-est birds

01:15:35.719 --> 01:15:38.763
and the shining-est sun.
Can you see it?

01:15:38.972 --> 01:15:40.307
Yeah.

01:15:40.473 --> 01:15:44.811
Good. Now, try to imagine me there,
walking along, playing a tin whistle

01:15:44.978 --> 01:15:47.522
just as happy as can be.
Do you see me?

01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:49.316
Yeah.

01:15:49.482 --> 01:15:53.069
Good. Of course,
I was in the Pomeranian navy then

01:15:53.236 --> 01:15:55.655
<i>and we wore white suits.</i>

01:15:55.864 --> 01:16:00.493
<i>With blue stripes and a white hat</i>
<i>with a little red ball on top.</i>

01:16:02.662 --> 01:16:06.708
<i>Oh, I was so happy</i>
<i>that I ran and jumped</i>

01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:11.630
<i>and leaped and played,</i>
<i>just for the fun of it.</i>

01:16:13.214 --> 01:16:15.550
<i>My, I felt good.</i>

01:16:15.967 --> 01:16:19.638
<i>It was such a wonderful, wonderful day.</i>

01:16:19.846 --> 01:16:23.141
<i>When all of a sudden</i>
<i>I stepped into a big hole and fell</i>

01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:25.226
<i>right to the bottom of it.</i>

01:16:29.648 --> 01:16:32.359
<i>I seemed to be in a long tunnel.</i>

01:16:33.068 --> 01:16:36.988
<i>Way ahead, I could see light,</i>
<i>so I started towards it.</i>

01:16:39.908 --> 01:16:45.080
<i>Finally, I reached the end</i>
<i>and found myself in a strange land.</i>

01:16:45.246 --> 01:16:46.706
<i>It looked...</i>

01:16:46.873 --> 01:16:50.794
<i>Well, it looked just like a page</i>
<i>out of a storybook</i>

01:16:51.503 --> 01:16:54.589
<i>and everything was hushed and still</i>

01:16:55.507 --> 01:16:59.302
<i>like your room at night</i>
<i>after you've gone to sleep.</i>

01:17:06.393 --> 01:17:08.687
Hello!

01:17:08.895 --> 01:17:10.939
Hello!

01:17:11.147 --> 01:17:14.567
Hello!

01:17:14.734 --> 01:17:18.905
Is anybody here?

01:17:44.598 --> 01:17:45.932
No music?

01:17:47.809 --> 01:17:49.978
I can't sing if I want to?

01:17:57.694 --> 01:17:59.446
Can I dance?

01:18:06.828 --> 01:18:11.625
- It's a law. It's a law. It's a law.
- It's a terrible law.

01:18:12.584 --> 01:18:18.006
<i>I'll sing and dance whenever I will</i>
<i>No law on Earth can keep me still</i>

01:18:25.513 --> 01:18:28.516
Young man, there is such a law.

01:18:28.767 --> 01:18:32.604
Our king forbids us to sing and dance.

01:18:32.812 --> 01:18:36.191
Wait. Where dwells
this monster of a king

01:18:36.358 --> 01:18:38.735
whose people may not dance and sing?

01:18:38.902 --> 01:18:43.323
In yonder castle,
but none can reach him.

01:18:47.869 --> 01:18:53.291
<i>Trust in me, my honored friend</i>
<i>I'll bring your sadness to an end</i>

01:19:25.907 --> 01:19:28.785
- Hello.
- Hello. Who are you?

01:19:28.994 --> 01:19:33.373
- What are you doing here?
- Just a sailor come a-visiting.

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.874
Why are you sad?

01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:36.376
- I'm not sad.
- Yes, you are.

01:19:36.543 --> 01:19:37.586
- I am not.
- You are so.

01:19:37.752 --> 01:19:39.170
- Not.
- Yes, you are.

01:19:39.337 --> 01:19:41.506
I'm lonesome.

01:19:41.673 --> 01:19:44.676
Well, you deserve to be lonesome.

01:19:44.884 --> 01:19:47.345
Lonesome's too good for you.

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.600
Passing a law like that,
not letting people sing and dance

01:19:51.766 --> 01:19:53.935
- aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- I had to.

01:19:54.102 --> 01:19:57.397
- What do you mean you had to?
- Well...

01:19:58.273 --> 01:20:02.569
A king's gotta do everything
his subjects do, see? Only better.

01:20:02.736 --> 01:20:09.451
Well, I can't sing and I can't dance,
so there had to be a law. I had to.

01:20:10.285 --> 01:20:13.496
You can so sing and dance.
Anybody can.

01:20:13.663 --> 01:20:17.667
Well, not anybody that's cranky
and gloomy and grumpy.

01:20:17.876 --> 01:20:22.422
But anybody whose heart is big
and warm and happy, they can.

01:20:22.631 --> 01:20:26.760
Go on. Try it, just for a minute.
Try being happy.

01:20:26.968 --> 01:20:29.179
<i>If you worry, if you worry</i>

01:20:29.346 --> 01:20:31.556
- <i>If you bother your head</i>
- I do.

01:20:31.723 --> 01:20:33.892
<i>It won't help you, it won't help you</i>

01:20:34.059 --> 01:20:36.102
- <i>It will hurt you instead</i>
- It will?

01:20:36.269 --> 01:20:38.521
<i>Grouchers, groaners</i>
<i>Cranks and moaners</i>

01:20:38.688 --> 01:20:40.690
- <i>They're so unfair</i>
- I know.

01:20:40.857 --> 01:20:45.028
<i>If you can't be gay and merry</i>
<i>Lock yourself in solitary</i>

01:20:45.236 --> 01:20:47.405
<i>Though it hurts you</i>
<i>Though it hurts you</i>

01:20:47.572 --> 01:20:49.449
<i>Be a pleasanter guy</i>

01:20:49.616 --> 01:20:51.826
<i>You may even learn to like it</i>

01:20:51.993 --> 01:20:54.079
- <i>If you give it a try</i>
- I'll try.

01:20:54.245 --> 01:20:57.707
<i>You could laugh and sing and dance</i>
<i>As gaily as an elf</i>

01:20:57.874 --> 01:21:02.337
<i>But don't expect to get much help</i>
<i>If you don't help yourself</i>

01:21:02.504 --> 01:21:04.631
- Will you try?
- If you show me.

01:21:04.798 --> 01:21:06.466
- I'll show you.
- I'll try.

01:21:06.633 --> 01:21:08.009
Good. One, two, three, four.

01:21:08.176 --> 01:21:10.095
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three.

01:21:10.262 --> 01:21:11.596
One, two, three.

01:21:13.014 --> 01:21:15.934
- You see?
- It's easy.

01:22:48.735 --> 01:22:51.529
Look at me. I'm dancing.

01:23:24.062 --> 01:23:28.650
- That's a beautiful story.
- And that's how I got my medal.

01:23:32.237 --> 01:23:35.156
I'm sorry, recess is over.

01:23:35.949 --> 01:23:40.537
Goodbye.

01:23:41.788 --> 01:23:43.206
Joe? Joe?

01:23:43.373 --> 01:23:45.292
What would you like most for a present?

01:23:45.917 --> 01:23:49.879
Well, don't tell Aunt Susie
I told you, now, because it's a secret

01:23:50.130 --> 01:23:53.174
and she said that you and Clarence
fixed it up with a man

01:23:53.383 --> 01:23:55.802
for her to get a new job
and make lots of money.

01:23:55.969 --> 01:23:59.306
So she's gonna buy us all the most
wonderful presents in the world.

01:23:59.472 --> 01:24:04.060
Joe, what would you rather have
than anything?

01:24:04.853 --> 01:24:07.522
Well, I'll sort of think it over
and let you know.

01:24:07.731 --> 01:24:10.317
Don't tell Aunt Susie I told you, now.

01:24:10.567 --> 01:24:12.694
No, no, I won't.

01:24:18.742 --> 01:24:20.452
- Hiya, Brooklyn.
- Hello.

01:24:20.619 --> 01:24:23.079
Joe. Am I glad to see you.

01:24:23.246 --> 01:24:25.332
Never mind about me.
What about you?

01:24:25.498 --> 01:24:28.168
I got a feeling you didn't
get in to see Iturbi.

01:24:28.335 --> 01:24:30.837
We're sunk.
I can't get through that gate.

01:24:31.004 --> 01:24:33.548
What do you mean you can't?

01:24:34.507 --> 01:24:37.427
Look, Joe, honest.
I've tried and tried, but it's no use.

01:24:37.594 --> 01:24:40.263
You have to have an appointment
or something.

01:24:42.474 --> 01:24:44.184
- Hello.
- Yes?

01:24:44.351 --> 01:24:46.978
My name is Joe Brady,
I'd like to see JosÃ© Iturbi.

01:24:47.145 --> 01:24:49.606
- Is he expecting you?
- Yes.

01:24:49.773 --> 01:24:52.275
Just a minute
and I'll let you talk to his secretary.

01:24:52.442 --> 01:24:54.402
Thank you very much.

01:24:55.904 --> 01:24:59.699
Hello, Jean. A Mr. Brady
from the United States Navy

01:24:59.866 --> 01:25:02.118
to see Mr. Iturbi,
says he's expected.

01:25:05.038 --> 01:25:06.456
Gee, I don't know, Joe.

01:25:06.623 --> 01:25:09.843
Sometimes when I watch you,
I feel that something's wrong with me.

01:25:09.943 --> 01:25:13.255
Look, Brooklyn, you just gotta learn
not to get scared, that's all.

01:25:14.422 --> 01:25:18.927
Hey, you! You, stop.
Wait a minute.

01:25:19.094 --> 01:25:23.807
Hey, I got a pass.
Brooklyn, I got a pass!

01:25:24.307 --> 01:25:25.976
Wait a minute. Stop.

01:25:26.142 --> 01:25:29.145
Now, wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute.

01:25:30.272 --> 01:25:32.440
- Stop.
- Brooklyn!

01:25:44.744 --> 01:25:48.248
- I guess everybody's out.
- Okay, let's go.

01:25:54.379 --> 01:25:57.048
Pardon me, can you tell me
where Mr. Iturbi's office is?

01:25:57.215 --> 01:26:00.051
- Sure, right over there.
- Thanks.

01:26:14.733 --> 01:26:16.192
Mr. Brady?

01:26:16.443 --> 01:26:19.195
I expect Mr. Iturbi at any moment.
Won't you sit down?

01:26:19.362 --> 01:26:20.864
Thanks.

01:26:23.533 --> 01:26:26.202
- Have you been at sea recently?
- Yeah, I'm on leave.

01:26:26.411 --> 01:26:29.247
I suppose you're having
a wonderful time.

01:26:29.956 --> 01:26:32.709
My name is Susan Abbott
and someone made an appointment

01:26:32.959 --> 01:26:35.879
for me to have an audition
with Mr. Iturbi this Saturday...

01:26:36.046 --> 01:26:40.008
- Ever speak to sailors, lady?
- Hello, Joe. What are you doing here?

01:26:40.216 --> 01:26:43.803
Clarence is off having a little chat
with JosÃ© and I was waiting for him.

01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:45.472
We can go out and have a Coke.

01:26:45.639 --> 01:26:47.599
- I was just...
- Ms. Abbott, I'm afraid...

01:26:47.766 --> 01:26:51.061
Hold on, that's all right, Jean.
Tell Mr. Iturbi she'll be back.

01:26:51.227 --> 01:26:53.438
- But Mr. Iturbi...
- Don't worry, I'll be back.

01:26:53.605 --> 01:26:55.357
Tell him to wait for me.

01:26:57.859 --> 01:27:00.528
Aunt Susie, you almost made
a terrible mistake.

01:27:00.695 --> 01:27:03.448
I just wanted to ask Mr. Iturbi
if there was any song

01:27:03.615 --> 01:27:05.617
that I should prepare for the audition.

01:27:05.784 --> 01:27:07.869
That's just what I thought you wanted.

01:27:08.036 --> 01:27:10.205
Boy, am I glad I was there to stop you.

01:27:10.413 --> 01:27:12.582
Believe me, Aunt Susie,
take my word for it.

01:27:12.749 --> 01:27:16.753
You shouldn't go even near that guy
until the very minute you're ready.

01:27:16.962 --> 01:27:18.463
But, Joe, why?

01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:22.676
Well, look, you go see him now,
you try to talk to him.

01:27:22.842 --> 01:27:25.804
He's polite, but he's busy.
It's just no good.

01:27:26.012 --> 01:27:28.807
But you wait till Saturday
at 11:15

01:27:28.974 --> 01:27:31.726
Iturbi is expecting one
of these big, beefy characters.

01:27:31.893 --> 01:27:35.105
Instead, you walk in.
You're all dressed up.

01:27:35.272 --> 01:27:36.982
You look like a million dollars.

01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:41.361
Go, Aunt Susie.
Believe me, you'll kill him, huh?

01:27:41.528 --> 01:27:43.446
Come on, sailor, I owe you a Coke.

01:27:45.323 --> 01:27:48.493
You're sort of Clarence's
guardian angel too, aren't you?

01:27:48.618 --> 01:27:50.078
What I mean is...

01:27:50.245 --> 01:27:54.666
Well, you're always with him
or talking about him. Why, Joe?

01:27:54.874 --> 01:27:58.837
Well, I... I figured he needed a girl

01:27:59.963 --> 01:28:02.090
but Clarence didn't want just any girl

01:28:02.257 --> 01:28:05.844
he wanted somebody
he could think about and write to

01:28:06.303 --> 01:28:07.971
and, you know, come home to.

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.851
I guess he found her, huh?

01:28:13.727 --> 01:28:16.062
What about you, Joe?
What do you want?

01:28:16.271 --> 01:28:19.107
- Me?
- What kind of girl do you like?

01:28:19.316 --> 01:28:21.026
Why?

01:28:21.234 --> 01:28:23.862
I guess I'm just curious.

01:28:24.029 --> 01:28:28.575
Well, the kind of girl I like
is a very definite kind of a girl.

01:28:28.742 --> 01:28:31.244
Take for example
the one I know here in Los Angeles.

01:28:31.411 --> 01:28:34.539
- You mean Lola.
- How...?

01:28:37.459 --> 01:28:39.961
Well, yeah. Take her, then.

01:28:40.295 --> 01:28:42.589
Nothing serious about her...

01:28:43.632 --> 01:28:47.052
I mean, nothing serious,
strictly for laughs.

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:50.472
She sees you, great. If she doesn't,
great, she'll find somebody

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.557
it doesn't tie you down at all.

01:28:52.724 --> 01:28:54.059
I see.

01:28:54.225 --> 01:28:56.811
You don't want to be tied down, do you?

01:28:57.062 --> 01:29:00.941
That's for guys like Clarence.
Nice guys.

01:29:01.107 --> 01:29:02.984
What I like is...

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.236
Yes, what do you like?

01:29:06.988 --> 01:29:08.531
Oh, I don't know, Aunt Susie.

01:29:08.698 --> 01:29:12.077
Right now I'm a little confused
about what I like, it's...

01:29:12.285 --> 01:29:15.872
- I have a feeling that everything is...
- Yes?

01:29:16.081 --> 01:29:18.458
Back on the set, kids, let's go.
Come on, Susie.

01:29:18.708 --> 01:29:21.127
Everybody works in the next shot,
come on.

01:29:21.336 --> 01:29:23.797
Joe, why don't you come down
to the cafÃ© tonight.

01:29:23.964 --> 01:29:25.799
You could bring your girl, you know.

01:29:25.966 --> 01:29:28.802
Well, maybe Clarence
would like to see you alone.

01:29:30.512 --> 01:29:32.138
All right.

01:29:41.856 --> 01:29:44.776
Call the Victory Committee
and tell them I'll be at the camp.

01:29:44.943 --> 01:29:47.153
But, Mr. Iturbi,
you have to be at the studio.

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:50.240
- How are you gonna get to the camp?
- I'll be able to make it.

01:29:50.407 --> 01:29:53.076
Please tell them not to expect me
until the last minute.

01:29:53.243 --> 01:29:55.912
Remember, later on you have
an appointment with Carlos.

01:29:56.079 --> 01:29:58.832
Yes, I remember. I'll be there.
And I'll be there on time.

01:29:58.999 --> 01:30:01.668
Please, stop worrying.
Give me the Tchaikovsky concerto.

01:30:01.835 --> 01:30:04.004
Go and get yourself
a double chocolate sundae.

01:30:04.170 --> 01:30:06.006
- Your next appointment...
- With walnuts.

01:30:06.172 --> 01:30:07.507
With walnuts.

01:30:53.261 --> 01:30:54.930
Again?

01:31:20.497 --> 01:31:22.582
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:31:22.832 --> 01:31:26.670
- Ahoy.
- Oh, I'm doing fine. Fine.

01:31:32.592 --> 01:31:35.637
You tune pianos or play them?

01:31:35.804 --> 01:31:37.722
A little bit of both.

01:31:51.152 --> 01:31:53.863
Hey, buddy. Hey, I know that song.

01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:55.782
- Oh, you do, huh?
- Sure.

01:31:55.949 --> 01:32:01.663
<i>Tonight we love while the moon beams</i>
<i>Down in dreamland</i>

01:32:01.913 --> 01:32:06.293
<i>Tonight we touch the stars</i>
<i>Love was ours</i>

01:32:07.252 --> 01:32:10.839
- Oh, sure, I like that.
- You like Tchaikovsky?

01:32:11.047 --> 01:32:13.300
- Who?
- Tchaikovsky, the composer.

01:32:13.466 --> 01:32:16.011
You must be mistaken, buddy.
Freddy Martin wrote that.

01:32:16.511 --> 01:32:18.972
I heard it on the radio
at least a thousand times.

01:32:19.139 --> 01:32:22.601
Well, you know, all those fellows,
they steal from each other.

01:32:23.935 --> 01:32:25.895
<i>Meant to borrow</i>
<i>But tomorrow</i>

01:32:27.063 --> 01:32:28.523
<i>I forgot the words</i>

01:32:32.652 --> 01:32:35.405
- Yeah, that's nice.
- I'm glad you like it.

01:32:35.614 --> 01:32:37.866
Say, do you know
what I would do if I were you?

01:32:38.033 --> 01:32:41.411
I'd quit this piano tuning,
ain't no future in it.

01:32:41.953 --> 01:32:43.705
- You play very well.
- Thank you.

01:32:43.872 --> 01:32:47.000
It's very nice to be encouraged.
You seem pretty good yourself.

01:32:47.167 --> 01:32:49.461
- Thank you.
- Well, I got to go now.

01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:51.296
I have a few more pianos to tune.

01:33:07.228 --> 01:33:08.939
Well, goodbye, sailor. Thanks again.

01:33:09.105 --> 01:33:10.982
- Keep plugging.
- Okay.

01:33:20.659 --> 01:33:24.788
Senor Clarence, friend of Susita.

01:33:24.996 --> 01:33:26.665
Senor Clarence.

01:33:26.873 --> 01:33:30.669
The whole street is talking
of what you are doing for our Susita.

01:33:30.835 --> 01:33:32.629
Yeah. I got a date with her.

01:33:32.796 --> 01:33:36.508
Oh, how happy she will be
to see you. Come.

01:33:36.758 --> 01:33:39.052
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

01:33:39.261 --> 01:33:42.931
But I must rush
and tell her that you are here.

01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:47.644
Senor Iturbi. He is well, yes?

01:33:47.852 --> 01:33:49.938
Oh, sure. Sure, he's well.

01:33:56.194 --> 01:33:58.363
Well, for heaven's sakes,
look who's here

01:33:58.571 --> 01:34:01.116
- and looking like he's at a wake.
- Hiya, Brooklyn.

01:34:01.283 --> 01:34:02.867
Yeah, I got a date with Susan.

01:34:03.034 --> 01:34:07.998
- What's the matter? Don't you like her?
- Sure, I like her. I think she's wonderful.

01:34:08.248 --> 01:34:12.294
Only, I'm gonna be all alone with her.
And I'll sit here like a dope, I know it.

01:34:12.502 --> 01:34:15.630
- I won't even know what to say.
- What are you worrying about?

01:34:15.797 --> 01:34:17.465
The first note I heard you sing

01:34:17.632 --> 01:34:20.051
I knew you were
the romantical-type fella.

01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:23.763
Quit your kidding. Think I'm just gonna
walk up to her and start singing?

01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:27.726
Of course you don't just walk up to her
and start singing. Look.

01:34:30.604 --> 01:34:32.230
I'm her.

01:34:32.772 --> 01:34:37.110
I'm just finishing dinner,
toying with my coffee.

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.364
The fellas are beating
their brains out playing soft music.

01:34:42.282 --> 01:34:43.783
I'm looking at you

01:34:44.701 --> 01:34:46.578
you're looking at me.

01:34:47.329 --> 01:34:49.664
Okay, take it.

01:34:51.207 --> 01:34:52.751
Gee, you're swell.

01:34:54.002 --> 01:34:56.463
Gee, thanks.

01:34:58.089 --> 01:35:01.176
That's right, that's the way.

01:35:08.475 --> 01:35:12.020
<i>The charm of you</i>

01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:15.565
<i>Is comparable to</i>

01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:21.404
<i>A Christmas tree with toys</i>

01:35:23.114 --> 01:35:26.743
<i>With little girls and boys</i>

01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:31.122
<i>When first they see</i>

01:35:32.082 --> 01:35:34.501
<i>The tree</i>

01:35:34.876 --> 01:35:38.672
<i>The thrill of you</i>

01:35:38.838 --> 01:35:41.716
<i>Is comparable to</i>

01:35:43.009 --> 01:35:48.181
<i>The thrill I felt when I</i>

01:35:48.807 --> 01:35:54.479
<i>First learned the heart could sigh</i>

01:35:55.689 --> 01:36:01.569
<i>And you were the reason why</i>

01:36:02.529 --> 01:36:08.493
<i>And yet, and yet</i>

01:36:09.452 --> 01:36:16.293
<i>If we two had never met</i>

01:36:16.501 --> 01:36:23.174
<i>I'd know your grace</i>
<i>That warms the face</i>

01:36:24.759 --> 01:36:29.764
<i>That only the angels get</i>

01:36:29.931 --> 01:36:35.895
<i>And so comparing you</i>

01:36:37.022 --> 01:36:41.901
<i>With all of these things is all</i>

01:36:42.068 --> 01:36:46.865
<i>That I can do</i>

01:36:48.617 --> 01:36:54.998
<i>Because they add up to</i>

01:36:56.082 --> 01:37:02.839
<i>The charm of you</i>

01:37:10.388 --> 01:37:12.807
Gee, I'd give a month's tips

01:37:12.974 --> 01:37:16.019
to have somebody sing
words like that to me.

01:37:16.227 --> 01:37:19.606
Somebody will, Brooklyn.
What do you bet?

01:37:19.814 --> 01:37:23.360
Some girls, when a fella comes
to see her, he brings flowers

01:37:23.526 --> 01:37:27.030
orchids even.
I'm the other type girl.

01:37:27.197 --> 01:37:32.911
Me, a fella brings four bottles of beer.
What's the sense of kidding myself?

01:37:33.078 --> 01:37:36.581
What are you talking yourself down for?
You're a terrific girl.

01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:38.583
Oh, go on.

01:37:44.756 --> 01:37:48.051
- I'd better get working.
- Hey, Brooklyn. Hey, I think you're...

01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:51.554
Oh, hello, Clarence.
I hope you haven't been waiting long.

01:37:51.805 --> 01:37:54.766
- Well, I...
- What did you say?

01:37:55.016 --> 01:37:57.394
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say a word.

01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.896
Did you have a nice time
with Mr. Iturbi today?

01:38:00.772 --> 01:38:04.276
I... I saw Joe at the studio
and he said you were there.

01:38:05.318 --> 01:38:07.404
You know, Clarence

01:38:07.570 --> 01:38:11.366
I feel as though Saturday
will never come. I can hardly wait.

01:38:11.574 --> 01:38:13.368
Well, it's natural, I guess.

01:38:13.618 --> 01:38:15.036
Until I'm doing it, I...

01:38:15.245 --> 01:38:19.708
I just can't believe that
I'm really going to sing for Mr. Iturbi.

01:38:19.916 --> 01:38:22.460
Susan, look,
there's something I've got to tell you.

01:38:22.627 --> 01:38:25.839
It may make a difference in the way
you feel about seeing me, even.

01:38:26.047 --> 01:38:27.591
But I've got to tell you.

01:38:27.757 --> 01:38:31.052
Well, please, Clarence,
don't tell me now.

01:38:31.219 --> 01:38:33.221
I like you very much

01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:35.974
but we haven't known
each other very long

01:38:36.182 --> 01:38:39.102
and sometimes it's a mistake
to say things too soon.

01:38:39.269 --> 01:38:41.855
- Do you think so?
- Oh, yes, I do.

01:38:43.565 --> 01:38:45.525
Now I feel better.

01:38:46.526 --> 01:38:48.945
I was afraid to tell you anyway.

01:38:50.196 --> 01:38:52.866
By the way, where is Joe tonight?

01:38:53.074 --> 01:38:57.454
Joe probably has a date with Lola.
He's crazy about her.

01:38:58.496 --> 01:39:03.668
I mean, she's crazy about him,
and he doesn't seem to mind it.

01:39:33.031 --> 01:39:34.366
That's just to hold you.

01:39:34.532 --> 01:39:37.077
Now, don't forget,
I got one wish coming.

01:39:53.385 --> 01:39:55.971
Let's keep the whole thing quiet, huh?

01:40:16.241 --> 01:40:17.742
Clarence, you're wonderful.

01:40:30.046 --> 01:40:33.675
You know, Clarence, I can't begin
to tell you how grateful I am.

01:40:33.883 --> 01:40:36.553
Oh, gee, Aunt Susan,
it's really nothing, I...

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.764
But I've waited all my life
for a chance like this.

01:40:40.515 --> 01:40:44.436
- Oh, mister, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right. It hardly touched me.

01:40:44.603 --> 01:40:45.937
Wanna come to the kitchen?

01:40:46.104 --> 01:40:48.523
Couple minutes next to that oven
and you'll be dry.

01:40:48.690 --> 01:40:50.775
Yes, Clarence,
you'd better go ahead. Hurry.

01:40:52.861 --> 01:40:56.489
So I says to myself,
"Half of every year for 18 years

01:40:56.656 --> 01:40:59.367
your feet get cold,
hands get chapped, nose gets blue.

01:40:59.534 --> 01:41:04.873
Get smart, get out of town," I said.
So here I come to sunny California.

01:41:05.081 --> 01:41:10.503
Sure, my nose don't get blue anymore,
but the rest of me is blue all the time.

01:41:11.379 --> 01:41:13.590
You're homesick, that's what.

01:41:13.757 --> 01:41:15.467
Yeah.

01:41:16.509 --> 01:41:19.220
I guess you're dry, I guess.

01:41:20.138 --> 01:41:21.806
I guess.

01:41:25.936 --> 01:41:27.520
Well...

01:41:38.782 --> 01:41:40.533
She's gone.

01:41:40.742 --> 01:41:42.410
No kidding?

01:41:42.577 --> 01:41:45.747
Don't worry, she must have gone up
to her dressing room to change.

01:41:45.914 --> 01:41:47.624
She'll be back in a minute.

01:41:48.959 --> 01:41:50.293
You know something?

01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:53.505
With you around, even with
the palm trees and this stuff

01:41:53.672 --> 01:41:55.757
this feels like Brooklyn.

01:41:55.924 --> 01:41:57.801
Gee, thanks.

01:41:57.968 --> 01:41:59.761
You're welcome.

01:42:01.972 --> 01:42:05.350
The customers are sitting in the inside
and the waitress sits outside.

01:42:28.915 --> 01:42:31.209
- Hiya, Joe.
- Oh, hi.

01:42:31.418 --> 01:42:34.462
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you. You having fun?

01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:38.300
- Oh, I'm having a swell time.
- Sure. All you needed was a girl.

01:42:38.466 --> 01:42:41.177
- Yeah.
- Say, you'd better get back to her.

01:42:41.386 --> 01:42:43.888
What are you doing out here, anyway?

01:42:44.973 --> 01:42:47.309
Listen, Joe, it's kind of tough

01:42:47.517 --> 01:42:50.604
what with the excitement and all
about her audition.

01:42:50.812 --> 01:42:52.772
Don't you think I'd better tell her?

01:42:53.398 --> 01:42:55.525
Oh, that's what I came down
to see you about.

01:42:55.692 --> 01:42:58.945
I thought not getting to Iturbi
might cramp your style with Susie

01:42:59.112 --> 01:43:01.031
so I found out where we could see him.

01:43:01.197 --> 01:43:04.701
Tomorrow, the first thing,
at the Hollywood Bowl.

01:43:04.868 --> 01:43:08.371
So don't worry, everything's gonna be
okay with you and Susan.

01:43:10.165 --> 01:43:12.459
- Thanks, Joe.
- Yeah.

01:43:12.667 --> 01:43:16.129
- Hollywood Bowl.
- Yeah, Hollywood Bowl.

01:47:09.362 --> 01:47:11.573
- Mr. Iturbi is in there, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:13.742
We're friends of his,
we'd like to see him.

01:47:13.909 --> 01:47:16.578
I'm sorry, boys,
I wish I could let you in, but I can't.

01:47:16.745 --> 01:47:18.997
Nobody is allowed in there
during rehearsals.

01:47:23.418 --> 01:47:26.671
I got a dream I dream all the time,
I go up to a cop and he says:

01:47:26.838 --> 01:47:29.257
"Glad to see you, come right in."

01:47:29.424 --> 01:47:32.969
- So we give up, huh?
- So we don't give up, huh.

01:48:52.757 --> 01:48:55.093
Come on, we got him cornered.

01:51:45.055 --> 01:51:47.307
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, all. Goodbye.

01:51:47.474 --> 01:51:49.768
- Goodbye, goodbye.
- Hey, where's Iturbi?

01:51:50.018 --> 01:51:56.024
Oh, he just left.
And he's eight minutes late. Oh, dear.

01:51:56.191 --> 01:51:57.609
Hey.

01:51:58.568 --> 01:52:01.112
Even you can be late, Joe.

01:52:01.279 --> 01:52:04.991
We just tell Susan the truth.
That's all there is to do.

01:52:08.495 --> 01:52:10.080
Okay, I'll go.

01:52:10.247 --> 01:52:11.706
Joe?

01:52:12.415 --> 01:52:14.000
I'll tell her.

01:52:14.167 --> 01:52:16.628
It's up to me to do it, not you.

01:52:19.714 --> 01:52:24.386
Now, look, I'll go out to the studio
and tell her it's all a phony.

01:52:24.552 --> 01:52:28.181
She'll be good and sore,
but at me, right?

01:52:28.473 --> 01:52:30.475
I'll tell her how I pulled you into it

01:52:30.642 --> 01:52:33.478
and how it all happened
because you're crazy about her.

01:52:33.645 --> 01:52:36.564
What's the use, Joe? We're due
back in San Diego tomorrow

01:52:36.731 --> 01:52:39.442
- and our leave is up.
- What difference does that make?

01:52:39.609 --> 01:52:41.778
Susan's not a girl just for a leave.

01:52:41.945 --> 01:52:43.530
Well...

01:52:43.738 --> 01:52:46.408
She's the kind you come home to and...

01:52:46.908 --> 01:52:49.327
- Well, this will do it.
- Joe?

01:52:49.494 --> 01:52:50.954
Yeah?

01:52:51.788 --> 01:52:53.748
There's something I've been...

01:52:55.792 --> 01:52:58.253
Yeah, yeah,
I guess you're right. Okay.

01:53:00.171 --> 01:53:03.091
I'll meet you at that little barn
near Susie's house about 6.

01:53:03.258 --> 01:53:05.677
That way I can tell you
how she took it.

01:53:05.844 --> 01:53:07.762
Unless you wanna come with me.

01:53:10.515 --> 01:53:12.892
Are you just gonna sit here?

01:53:13.685 --> 01:53:16.229
Yeah, yeah, I'm tired.

01:53:34.205 --> 01:53:38.585
<i>I fall in love</i>

01:53:38.752 --> 01:53:44.132
<i>Too easily</i>

01:53:45.759 --> 01:53:49.262
<i>I fall in love</i>

01:53:49.429 --> 01:53:52.223
<i>Too fast</i>

01:53:54.267 --> 01:53:57.646
<i>I fall in love</i>

01:53:57.812 --> 01:54:02.025
<i>Too terribly hard</i>

01:54:02.609 --> 01:54:09.366
<i>For love to ever last</i>

01:54:10.742 --> 01:54:17.165
<i>My heart should be well-schooled</i>

01:54:17.666 --> 01:54:22.087
<i>'Cause I've been fooled</i>

01:54:23.964 --> 01:54:27.717
<i>In the past</i>

01:54:27.884 --> 01:54:36.434
<i>And still I fall in love too easily</i>

01:54:42.190 --> 01:54:47.571
<i>I fall in love</i>

01:54:47.737 --> 01:54:54.494
<i>Too fast</i>

01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:14.556
Brooklyn, I love you.

01:55:14.723 --> 01:55:17.142
Oh, no. No, you love Susie.

01:55:17.309 --> 01:55:19.269
I did, but I don't.

01:55:19.436 --> 01:55:22.480
I know it's awful, but I can't help it.
I love you.

01:55:22.647 --> 01:55:24.816
I don't think it's so terrible.

01:55:24.983 --> 01:55:26.735
Yes, it is.

01:55:26.943 --> 01:55:30.780
There is Joe, off telling Susie
that I want to come home to her

01:55:30.947 --> 01:55:33.491
and here I want to come home to you.

01:55:33.658 --> 01:55:35.827
Gee, I got a feeling I'm...

01:55:35.994 --> 01:55:38.371
I got a feeling I'm fickle.

01:55:44.210 --> 01:55:46.546
You're gonna marry me, aren't you?

01:55:48.048 --> 01:55:50.008
But, Brooklyn...

01:55:50.175 --> 01:55:53.929
Before I say for sure,
there's something I gotta tell you.

01:55:54.095 --> 01:55:56.222
So that everything will be
on the level, see?

01:55:56.389 --> 01:55:59.476
No, no. Whatever happened
before you met me, it doesn't count.

01:55:59.643 --> 01:56:01.978
But this was after I met you.

01:56:02.145 --> 01:56:03.772
It was?

01:56:04.147 --> 01:56:06.358
I don't care.
You still don't have to tell me.

01:56:06.524 --> 01:56:09.277
But I wanna. I gotta.

01:56:10.195 --> 01:56:15.867
Well, last night, when I dropped
the soup on you by accident

01:56:16.034 --> 01:56:18.411
it wasn't no accident.

01:56:18.578 --> 01:56:21.539
I didn't want you
to sit there with her.

01:56:22.707 --> 01:56:24.751
Why, Brooklyn

01:56:24.918 --> 01:56:29.172
that's just about the nicest thing
that anyone has ever done for me.

01:56:29.339 --> 01:56:31.758
Imagine, you were jealous.

01:56:36.137 --> 01:56:41.017
But, honey, you better tell your pal
to stop fixing it up with Susan.

01:56:41.601 --> 01:56:45.272
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right.
- Yeah.

01:56:45.438 --> 01:56:47.983
Because bigamy, I don't believe in.

01:56:50.527 --> 01:56:53.405
Everybody on the set for the morning
at 9:00 sharp.

01:56:53.530 --> 01:56:55.282
Susie.

01:56:55.490 --> 01:56:57.826
Can I speak to you for a minute?

01:56:58.451 --> 01:57:00.704
What would you like to say?

01:57:01.788 --> 01:57:04.874
- Well, I...
- Perhaps I could tell you.

01:57:05.041 --> 01:57:08.461
Clarence is a very fine boy,
that I know.

01:57:08.878 --> 01:57:12.465
You saved his life,
so you owe him something.

01:57:13.133 --> 01:57:15.468
You've decided
that he's just about right for me.

01:57:15.635 --> 01:57:17.512
Does that cover everything?

01:57:17.679 --> 01:57:19.806
No, that doesn't come anywhere near it.

01:57:19.973 --> 01:57:24.644
Oh, I forgot.
You like a very definite type of girl

01:57:24.811 --> 01:57:28.023
and I'm very definitely not it.

01:57:28.273 --> 01:57:30.817
Oh, don't be mad, Aunt Susie.

01:57:35.155 --> 01:57:36.573
I'm sorry.

01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:38.491
What is it, Joe?

01:57:41.328 --> 01:57:43.997
Susie, what I wanna say...

01:57:45.665 --> 01:57:48.126
Well, it's not awfully...

01:57:51.212 --> 01:57:53.757
Same thing happens every time
I'm with you.

01:57:53.924 --> 01:57:56.301
I hear myself saying words

01:57:56.968 --> 01:58:00.347
that never have anything to do
with the things I feel about you.

01:58:00.513 --> 01:58:04.768
All I know are the things you say, Joe,
and I don't like them.

01:58:08.104 --> 01:58:10.190
Susan, I've never said to you

01:58:10.357 --> 01:58:13.026
what I really wanted to say because...

01:58:14.861 --> 01:58:18.573
I guess because my way of saying it
just isn't good enough.

01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:23.161
- Then there must be some other way.
- Sure there is.

01:58:23.328 --> 01:58:28.750
Comes right out of <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>
<i>Three Musketeers</i>

01:58:28.959 --> 01:58:31.586
and all the books and poems.

01:58:31.753 --> 01:58:33.630
Those are the words I wanna say, but...

01:58:35.757 --> 01:58:37.509
I can't. You'd laugh at me.

01:58:37.676 --> 01:58:40.136
- I don't think so.
- Well, then I'd laugh at myself.

01:58:40.303 --> 01:58:42.430
Words like that don't go
with sailor suits

01:58:42.597 --> 01:58:45.725
and three-day leaves
and the world we live in.

01:58:45.976 --> 01:58:50.230
They go with that world,
cloaks and swords and...

01:58:50.397 --> 01:58:52.274
Oh, I don't know.

01:58:53.024 --> 01:58:56.069
If you lived in that house,
then I could tell you.

01:58:56.236 --> 01:58:58.446
But I do live in that house.

01:59:02.117 --> 01:59:04.411
If you lived in that house

01:59:05.662 --> 01:59:08.373
in some other time, you'd be...

01:59:08.915 --> 01:59:11.126
You'd be a princess

01:59:11.418 --> 01:59:16.506
and I'd be a bandit chief
who had to hide out in the hills.

01:59:17.215 --> 01:59:20.260
A bandit who had seen the princess once

01:59:20.427 --> 01:59:23.263
and having seen her,
could never forget her.

01:59:23.972 --> 01:59:28.393
Then one night,
he'd risk his life to see her again.

01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:33.607
Hiding in a shadow here,
a patch of darkness there...

02:04:29.277 --> 02:04:31.363
Hiya, Clarence.

02:04:32.322 --> 02:04:33.865
- Joe.
- Yeah?

02:04:34.032 --> 02:04:35.575
You...

02:04:36.451 --> 02:04:38.161
Nothing.

02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:41.373
- Clarence.
- Yeah, Joe?

02:04:42.916 --> 02:04:45.043
It's been a hot day.

02:04:46.086 --> 02:04:48.922
Give me a Scotch. A double.

02:04:53.593 --> 02:04:56.012
Are you used to that stuff?

02:04:56.179 --> 02:04:59.766
No, I never touch it.
It cuts down on your wind.

02:05:10.735 --> 02:05:12.445
Yeah.

02:05:12.612 --> 02:05:14.823
It's been a hot day.

02:05:15.073 --> 02:05:18.743
- Look, Joe...
- No, Clarence, you look.

02:05:18.910 --> 02:05:24.624
Clarence, sometimes things happen
and you just can't help them, see?

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.128
You meet somebody and you don't think
it's anything, and then

02:05:28.295 --> 02:05:29.963
all of a sudden it is something.

02:05:30.130 --> 02:05:32.674
Gee, that's exactly
the way it happened.

02:05:33.133 --> 02:05:35.051
Don't I know.

02:05:35.218 --> 02:05:37.012
It's...

02:05:37.178 --> 02:05:39.306
It's wonderful, though.

02:05:39.472 --> 02:05:41.349
It could be.

02:05:41.516 --> 02:05:44.311
But not when you double-cross a pal.

02:05:46.563 --> 02:05:48.940
When did you find out, Joe?

02:05:49.190 --> 02:05:50.692
Today.

02:05:50.859 --> 02:05:53.987
But I've had a hunch about it
pretty nearly from the beginning.

02:05:54.154 --> 02:05:56.865
- You did?
- Yeah.

02:05:57.824 --> 02:06:00.076
It's funny, I didn't.

02:06:00.243 --> 02:06:03.622
Not for sure. Not till I kissed her.

02:06:04.247 --> 02:06:08.001
Of course, last night
when she dropped her soup on me

02:06:08.209 --> 02:06:10.211
I should have known.

02:06:14.466 --> 02:06:16.134
The waitress?

02:06:16.301 --> 02:06:17.886
Yeah.

02:06:18.345 --> 02:06:20.847
Gee, she's a terrible waitress.

02:06:24.643 --> 02:06:26.728
You mean you're not sore, Joe?

02:06:26.895 --> 02:06:30.857
No, no. I'm not sore.
No, I forgive you.

02:06:32.817 --> 02:06:34.778
Is she sore? Susan?

02:06:35.445 --> 02:06:40.075
Susan? No, I wouldn't say
she acted sore. No, not at all.

02:06:40.242 --> 02:06:43.828
Even when you told her that there
wasn't gonna be any audition?

02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:50.126
Joe.

02:06:50.293 --> 02:06:52.545
You mean you didn't tell her?

02:06:54.381 --> 02:06:56.967
Well, what did you tell her?

02:06:57.133 --> 02:07:00.345
What could you be talking about
all this time?

02:07:04.266 --> 02:07:08.520
Just things.
You know how it is with things.

02:07:11.022 --> 02:07:15.277
Joe, you're in love
with Susan yourself.

02:07:21.616 --> 02:07:24.953
- You gonna ask her to marry you?
- Sure.

02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:28.999
Well, when? Before or after
she doesn't have her audition?

02:07:36.339 --> 02:07:37.966
Iturbi.

02:07:38.174 --> 02:07:41.636
Iturbi. I gotta get to Iturbi.

02:07:42.178 --> 02:07:45.181
But where? I don't know where.

02:07:45.348 --> 02:07:48.685
Oh, Clarence, where can he be?
He's gotta light someplace sometime.

02:07:48.852 --> 02:07:51.646
There's gotta be someplace
he calls home.

02:07:53.356 --> 02:07:54.774
Home.

02:07:55.734 --> 02:07:56.943
Home.

02:08:15.587 --> 02:08:19.466
Good morning. Well, thank you.

02:08:19.716 --> 02:08:21.593
Can I help you gentlemen?

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:26.389
Well, we were looking for Mr. Iturbi.
Will he be in this morning?

02:08:26.556 --> 02:08:29.434
He gave a concert
at Bakersfield last night.

02:08:29.601 --> 02:08:32.520
And when he returns
he'll probably go straight to the studio.

02:08:32.687 --> 02:08:34.439
Is there any message?

02:08:35.565 --> 02:08:37.317
Well...

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:40.779
- No. No, thanks.
- Very well.

02:08:43.865 --> 02:08:46.117
Gee, that's awful.

02:08:49.913 --> 02:08:52.249
What are you gonna do, Joe?

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:59.130
Well, I'll go to her house
and stop her before she leaves.

02:08:59.547 --> 02:09:01.883
Now, look,
don't let this spoil it for you, kid.

02:09:02.050 --> 02:09:04.719
You go see your girl,
you haven't got much time.

02:09:04.886 --> 02:09:06.763
I'll meet you at the bus.

02:09:06.930 --> 02:09:08.682
You want me to go with you?

02:09:08.848 --> 02:09:10.267
No.

02:09:21.486 --> 02:09:24.531
Joe, I was afraid
I wouldn't get to see you again.

02:09:24.698 --> 02:09:28.118
What, you think I'd go away
without saying goodbye?

02:09:28.285 --> 02:09:32.080
Aunt Susie isn't home.
She went to the studio.

02:09:40.630 --> 02:09:42.132
Look.

02:09:42.632 --> 02:09:44.259
Donald.

02:09:44.926 --> 02:09:46.803
I've gotta go back to my ship

02:09:46.970 --> 02:09:49.973
and I don't know if I'll get to see
Aunt Susan again or not.

02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:53.643
- So will you tell her something for me?
- Sure.

02:09:53.852 --> 02:09:56.980
- Sure, Joe.
- Okay, you tell her that

02:09:57.772 --> 02:10:02.485
I tried awfully hard to make things
come out right and that

02:10:03.612 --> 02:10:06.948
I'm awfully sorry
that it had to end this way.

02:10:07.324 --> 02:10:08.658
You got that?

02:10:16.374 --> 02:10:18.335
- Good morning, Mr. Iturbi.
- Good morning.

02:10:18.501 --> 02:10:20.921
- Here's your coffee and doughnut.
- Thank you, dear.

02:10:35.435 --> 02:10:37.062
Mr. Iturbi, I'm so excited.

02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:39.814
Imagine running into you this morning
of all mornings.

02:10:40.607 --> 02:10:44.027
Do so hope I won't be
a disappointment to you.

02:10:44.194 --> 02:10:48.657
- A disappointment? To me?
- How silly of me.

02:10:48.823 --> 02:10:50.867
You don't even know who I am, do you?

02:10:51.034 --> 02:10:55.580
- Well, I'm Susan Abbott.
- Oh, that's nice.

02:10:56.373 --> 02:10:59.251
You know,
your friends told you about me.

02:10:59.417 --> 02:11:00.794
Clarence and Joe.

02:11:01.461 --> 02:11:04.547
And, well, this is going to be
quite a day for me.

02:11:04.714 --> 02:11:08.468
It looks like quite a day for me too.

02:11:08.718 --> 02:11:12.681
You know, I had rather expected
that Joe would be with you today

02:11:12.889 --> 02:11:16.643
but I'm sort of glad he isn't,
that would make me too nervous.

02:11:17.143 --> 02:11:21.856
- You don't know him very well, do you?
- Not really well.

02:11:22.023 --> 02:11:25.777
You'd love him
because he's really a wonderful person.

02:11:25.944 --> 02:11:28.321
Well, what I mean is that...

02:11:28.488 --> 02:11:34.703
- Well, he's Clarence's best friend and...
- Oh, he's Clarence's best friend?

02:11:34.869 --> 02:11:36.830
And I know Clarence very well, don't I?

02:11:36.997 --> 02:11:39.958
You'd hardly be giving me
an audition if you didn't.

02:11:40.333 --> 02:11:42.168
An audition.

02:11:42.335 --> 02:11:44.546
And when is it going to be,
this audition?

02:11:45.213 --> 02:11:50.010
11:15 this morning.
You didn't remember it?

02:11:51.386 --> 02:11:55.223
Well, it isn't exactly
that I didn't remember.

02:11:55.390 --> 02:11:57.350
It's that...

02:11:57.601 --> 02:12:01.396
It's that you didn't know
anything about it.

02:12:04.107 --> 02:12:07.527
That there never was really
an audition at all.

02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:14.367
Oh, Mr. Iturbi, I'm terribly sorry.
See, it's just that Joe and Clarence...

02:12:14.576 --> 02:12:17.829
Joe and Clarence told me
that they had arranged for...

02:12:17.996 --> 02:12:19.956
What I mean is that...

02:12:20.123 --> 02:12:23.627
It is a joke. I can see that now.

02:12:23.793 --> 02:12:25.795
Please forgive me.

02:12:26.379 --> 02:12:29.507
Wait. Wait for a minute.

02:12:30.842 --> 02:12:34.930
These boys,
you like them very much, yes?

02:12:35.138 --> 02:12:37.849
Especially this Joe. Don't you?

02:12:38.016 --> 02:12:39.684
Yes.

02:12:40.226 --> 02:12:44.773
To throw away a friend in anger,
this is not good.

02:12:45.190 --> 02:12:48.902
And perhaps, if we talk a little
about this terrible situation

02:12:49.027 --> 02:12:52.197
perhaps it will turn out
not to be so terrible.

02:12:55.533 --> 02:12:58.453
- Camera ready.
- All right.

02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:10.131
<i>From the heart of a lonely poet</i>

02:13:10.298 --> 02:13:14.135
<i>Came a song for the girl he adored</i>

02:13:14.302 --> 02:13:17.681
<i>Though she tried very hard</i>
<i>Not to show it</i>

02:13:17.847 --> 02:13:22.894
<i>She was terribly, terribly bored</i>

02:13:25.313 --> 02:13:29.734
<i>But then the poet asked her</i>
<i>If she'd like a walk</i>

02:13:29.901 --> 02:13:34.739
<i>And her eyes shone</i>
<i>And the moon shone</i>

02:13:34.906 --> 02:13:37.325
<i>And the stars shone</i>

02:13:37.534 --> 02:13:41.621
<i>Up above</i>

02:13:41.788 --> 02:13:47.335
<i>And they walked</i>
<i>Through the evening together</i>

02:13:47.502 --> 02:13:54.301
<i>They were swaying</i>
<i>To the music of a drum and violin</i>

02:13:54.467 --> 02:13:58.263
<i>He held her and told her he'd love her</i>

02:13:58.430 --> 02:14:01.975
<i>Till the moon faded above her</i>

02:14:14.821 --> 02:14:18.325
<i>As they walked</i>
<i>Though she tried not to show it</i>

02:14:18.491 --> 02:14:25.373
<i>She was certain</i>
<i>She'd fallen in love</i>

02:14:45.727 --> 02:14:50.315
<i>And her eyes shone</i>
<i>And the moon shone</i>

02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:53.485
<i>And the stars shone</i>

02:14:53.652 --> 02:14:58.406
<i>Up above</i>

02:14:58.573 --> 02:15:02.953
<i>And they walked</i>
<i>Through the evening together</i>

02:15:03.161 --> 02:15:09.542
<i>They were swaying</i>
<i>To the music of a drum and violin</i>

02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:13.171
<i>The spell of the moon</i>
<i>Fell upon them</i>

02:15:13.338 --> 02:15:17.092
<i>And the stardust</i>
<i>Breathed upon them</i>

02:15:30.438 --> 02:15:34.025
<i>As they walked</i>
<i>Though she tried not to show it</i>

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:37.946
<i>You could see in her eyes a light</i>

02:15:38.154 --> 02:15:41.825
<i>She was certain</i>
<i>She'd fallen in love</i>

02:15:41.992 --> 02:15:45.287
<i>As they walked</i>
<i>Through the thrill of the night</i>

02:16:16.651 --> 02:16:21.031
- Why don't you write her a letter.
- Because there isn't anything to say.

02:16:21.197 --> 02:16:22.991
Well, tell her you're sorry.

02:16:23.158 --> 02:16:25.785
- She knows I'm sorry.
- How does she know?

02:16:25.952 --> 02:16:28.914
Oh, Clarence, will you
write Brooklyn a letter

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:32.500
or wash some socks
or go to sleep or something?

02:16:36.879 --> 02:16:38.505
Carry on.

02:16:38.673 --> 02:16:42.552
You boys were looking for me.
What did you want to see me about?

02:16:43.011 --> 02:16:45.555
Well, I...

02:16:49.768 --> 02:16:52.603
- It's too late now.
- That, of course, I can tell.

02:16:52.771 --> 02:16:54.731
Come, come along. We'll talk it over.

02:16:54.897 --> 02:16:58.151
- Come on, I haven't got much time.
- Go ahead.

02:17:05.492 --> 02:17:08.912
- Brooklyn, what are you doing here?
- Are you complaining, honey?

02:17:10.621 --> 02:17:13.666
Joe, you stay right here.
Don't go away.

02:17:25.428 --> 02:17:30.225
Ladies and gentlemen,
today I invited myself to your concert.

02:17:30.392 --> 02:17:34.396
And because I felt it might be
of special interest to you

02:17:34.563 --> 02:17:39.066
I requested Admiral Hammond to grant
a young artist permission

02:17:39.234 --> 02:17:41.111
to make her debut right here.

02:17:41.653 --> 02:17:43.822
Therefore, allow me to introduce to you

02:17:43.989 --> 02:17:46.907
a singer discovered
by the United States Navy.

02:17:47.075 --> 02:17:48.410
Miss Susan Abbott.

02:17:59.879 --> 02:18:02.507
In about five minutes,
I will introduce to you

02:18:02.674 --> 02:18:06.011
a young singer discovered
by the United States Navy.

02:18:08.763 --> 02:18:15.395
<i>Anchors aweigh, my boys</i>
<i>Anchors aweigh</i>

02:18:15.603 --> 02:18:21.942
<i>Farewell to college joys</i>
<i>We sail at break of day</i>

02:18:22.152 --> 02:18:28.407
<i>Through our last night on shore</i>
<i>Drink to the foam</i>

02:18:28.575 --> 02:18:31.452
<i>Until we meet once more</i>

02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:38.376
<i>Here's wishing you</i>
<i>A happy voyage home</i>

02:18:39.209 --> 02:18:45.967
<i>Anchors aweigh</i>

02:19:08.615 --> 02:19:10.700
