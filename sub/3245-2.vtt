WEBVTT

00:04.463 --> 00:05.510
Run.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.310
I'm the Doctor, by the way.
What's your name?

00:10.427 --> 00:13.101
- Rose.
- Nice to meet you, Rose. Run for your life!

00:19.269 --> 00:20.862
It's gonna follow us!

00:20.938 --> 00:23.316
The assembled hoards of Genghis Khan
couldn't get through that door,

00:23.398 --> 00:24.775
and believe me, they've tried.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.077
- Are you alien?
- Yes.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.081
You could come with me.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.410
- Is it always this dangerous?
- Yeah.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.927
Right, Rose Tyler,
you tell me, where do you wanna go?

00:44.002 --> 00:48.303
Backwards or forwards in time?
It's your choice. What's it gonna be?

00:49.841 --> 00:51.013
Forwards.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.605
- How far?
- One hundred years.

01:09.278 --> 01:12.452
There you go! Step outside those
doors, it's the 22nd century.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.161
- You're kidding.
- That's a bit boring, though.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.333
Do you wanna go further?

01:15.492 --> 01:16.664
Fine by me.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.258
Ten thousand years
in the future.

01:27.337 --> 01:31.683
Step outside,
it's the year 12005. The new Roman Empire.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.635
You think you're so impressive.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.892
- I am so impressive.
- You wish!

01:36.221 --> 01:39.725
Right, then. You asked for it.
I know exactly where to go.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.445
Hold on!

02:00.287 --> 02:02.039
Where are we?

02:04.583 --> 02:06.335
What's out there?

02:37.407 --> 02:41.628
You lot... You spend all your
time thinking about dying.

02:41.703 --> 02:46.425
How you're gonna get killed by eggs or beef
or global warming or asteroids.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.963
But you never take time
to imagine the impossible.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.797
That maybe you survived.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.978
This is the year 5.5/Apple/26.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.147
Five billion years
in your future.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.770
And this is the day...

03:02.974 --> 03:04.396
Hold on...

03:11.608 --> 03:13.736
This is the day
the sun expands.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.032
Welcome to
the end of the world.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.803
Shuttles
five and six now docking.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.881
Guests are reminded
that Platform One

04:15.964 --> 04:19.685
forbids the use of weapons,
teleportation and religion.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.681
Earth-death
is scheduled for 15:39,

04:23.764 --> 04:26.643
followed by drinks
in the Manchester Suite.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.236
So when it says
"guests", does that mean people?

04:30.312 --> 04:31.780
Depends what you mean
by people.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.734
- I mean people. What do you mean?
- Aliens.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.658
What are they doing
on board this spaceship? What's it all for?

04:38.737 --> 04:41.832
It's not really a spaceship,
more like an observation deck.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.956
The great and the good
are gathering to watch the planet burn.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.662
- What for?
- Fun!

04:50.540 --> 04:54.295
Mind you, when I say "the great and the
good", what I mean is the rich.

04:54.377 --> 04:59.099
But... Hold on, they did this
once on Newsround Extra, the sun expanding,

04:59.174 --> 05:01.677
- that takes hundreds of years.
- Millions.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.808
But the planet's now
the property of the National Trust.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.013
They've been
keeping it preserved.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.942
See down there?
Gravity satellites holding back the sun.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.236
The planet looks
the same as ever.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.530
I thought the continent
shifted and things.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.734
They did, and the Trust
shifted 'em back! That's a classic Earth.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.912
But now
the money's run out, nature takes over.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.243
How long's it got?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.701
About half an hour.
Then the planet gets roasted.

05:26.409 --> 05:30.004
Is that why we're here?
I mean, is that what you do?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.503
Jump in at the last minute
and save the Earth?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.926
I'm not saving it. Time's up.

05:35.418 --> 05:39.013
- But what about the people?
- It's empty. They've all gone. All left.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.934
- Just me, then.
- Who the hell are you?

05:46.054 --> 05:49.058
- Oh, that's nice. Thanks.
- But how did you get in?

05:49.391 --> 05:51.860
This is a maximum
hospitality zone.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.609
The guests have disembarked!
They're on their way any second...

05:54.729 --> 05:57.107
No! That's me. I'm a guest.
Look, I've got an invitation.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.280
Look, there you see?
It's fine. You see?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.451
"The Doctor, plus one."

06:00.527 --> 06:03.030
I'm the Doctor,
this is Rose Tyler, she's my "plus one".

06:03.113 --> 06:04.535
Is that all right?

06:04.614 --> 06:06.457
Well, obviously.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.377
Apologies, et cetera.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.205
If you're on board,
we'd better start.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.088
Enjoy.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.638
The paper's slightly psychic.
It shows them whatever I want them to see.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.639
Saves a lot of time.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.804
- He's blue.
- Yeah.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.059
Okay.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.890
We have in attendance,
the Doctor and Rose Tyler!

06:28.972 --> 06:31.816
Thank you.
All staff to their positions.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.943
Hurry now! Thank you!
Quick as we can, come along, come along!

06:38.398 --> 06:41.151
And now, might I introduce
the next honoured guest

06:41.276 --> 06:45.907
representing
the Forest of Cheem, we have trees.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.160
Namely Jabe, Lute and Coffa.

06:49.242 --> 06:53.167
There will be an exchange
of gifts, representing peace.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.795
If you could keep the room
circulating, thank you.

06:56.166 --> 07:02.173
Next, from the solicitors Jolco and
Jolco, we have the Moxx of Balhoon.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.676
And next,
from Financial Family Seven,

07:05.800 --> 07:08.770
we have the Adherents
of the Repeated Meme.

07:09.429 --> 07:14.777
The inventors of hyposlip travel systems,
the brothers Hop Pyleen! Thank you.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.353
Cal "Sparkplug"...

07:16.478 --> 07:18.025
Mr and Mrs Pakoo.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.195
The ambassadors from
the City State of Binding Light...

07:22.192 --> 07:27.039
The gift of peace. I bring you
a cutting of my grandfather.

07:28.615 --> 07:32.290
- Thank you.
- Yes, gifts, urn...

07:32.369 --> 07:35.964
I give you in return
air from my lungs.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.803
How intimate.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.551
There's more
where that came from.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.890
I bet there is.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.479
The sponsor
of the main event, please welcome...

07:51.554 --> 07:53.227
the Face of Boe.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.312
The Moxx of Balhoon.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.570
My felicitations upon this
historical happenstance.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.655
I bring you the gift
of bodily salivas.

08:06.695 --> 08:07.992
Thank you very much.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.918
Ah! The Adherents
of the Repeated Meme!

08:12.993 --> 08:15.087
I bring you air from my lungs.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.589
A gift of peace.
In all good faith.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.590
And last but not least,
our very special guest.

08:25.714 --> 08:31.847
Ladies and gentlemen and trees and
multiforms, consider the Earth, below.

08:32.429 --> 08:36.730
In memory of this dying world,
we call forth...

08:37.433 --> 08:39.607
the last human.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.741
The Lady Cassandra O'Brien
Dot Delta Seventeen.

08:45.442 --> 08:49.618
Oh, now don't stare!
I know, I know. It's shocking, isn't it?

08:50.196 --> 08:54.793
I've had my chin completely taken
away and look at the difference!

08:54.909 --> 08:59.710
Look how thin I am.
Thin and dainty!

09:00.081 --> 09:02.300
I don't look a day over 2,000.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.758
Moisturise me, moisturise me!

09:06.963 --> 09:09.933
Truly, I am the last human.

09:10.467 --> 09:15.064
My father was a Texan,
my mother was from the Arctic desert.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.650
They were born on the Earth

09:18.767 --> 09:22.442
and they were the last
to be buried in its soil.

09:23.480 --> 09:28.828
I have come
to honour them and say goodbye.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.781
Oh, no tears, no tears...

09:33.490 --> 09:34.912
I'm sorry.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.502
But behold!
I bring gifts!

09:40.955 --> 09:45.802
From Earth itself,
the last remaining ostrich egg.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.181
Legend says, it had
a wingspan of 50 feet!

09:50.256 --> 09:52.600
And blew fire
from its nostrils.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.766
Or was that my third husband?

09:54.844 --> 09:59.099
Oh, no, oh, don't laugh,
I'll get laughter-lines.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.276
No, stop!

10:03.019 --> 10:04.942
Mercy!

10:05.355 --> 10:08.359
And here! Another rarity.

10:09.150 --> 10:13.030
According to the archives,
this was called an iPod.

10:13.154 --> 10:17.375
It stores classical music from
humanity's greatest composers.

10:17.659 --> 10:18.911
Play on!

10:29.295 --> 10:31.468
The refreshments
will now be served.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.476
Earth-death in 30 minutes.

10:34.551 --> 10:40.229
♪ Sometimes I feel
I've got to run away

10:40.306 --> 10:44.903
♪ I've got to get away
from the pain

10:44.978 --> 10:48.482
♪ That you drive
into the heart of me

10:48.565 --> 10:54.914
♪ The love we share
seems to go nowhere

10:55.029 --> 10:58.499
♪ And I've lost my light

10:58.575 --> 11:02.500
♪ For I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night... ♪

11:02.579 --> 11:05.253
- Doctor.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.753
Thank you.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.342
A gift of peace
in all good faith.

11:11.421 --> 11:14.345
No, you're very kind,
but I'm just the steward.

11:14.424 --> 11:18.099
A gift of peace
in all good faith.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.439
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Of course.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.437
Identify species.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.063
Please identify species.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.943
Now stop it!

11:30.023 --> 11:32.776
Identify his race.
Where's he from?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.247
It's impossible.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.068
Sorry, am I allowed
to be in here?

12:11.814 --> 12:14.613
You have to give us
permission to talk.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.992
Urn...

12:19.489 --> 12:23.335
- You have permission.
- Thank you.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.621
And, no, you're not in the way.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.378
- Guests are allowed anywhere.
- Okay.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.844
- What's your name?
- Raffalo.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.718
- Raffalo?
- Yes, miss.

12:40.927 --> 12:44.181
I won't be long, I've just got
to carry out some maintenance.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.438
There's a tiny little glitch
in the Face of Boe's suite.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.979
There must be something
blocking the system.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.440
He's not getting any hot water.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.528
- So, you're a plumber?
- That's right, miss.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.947
They still have plumbers?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.953
I hope so,
else I'm out of a job!

13:04.325 --> 13:07.249
- Where are you from?
- Crespallion.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.420
That's a planet, is it?

13:11.791 --> 13:14.715
No, Crespallion's part of
the Jaggit Brocade,

13:14.794 --> 13:17.843
affiliated to the
Scarlet Junction, Convex 56.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.301
And where are you from, miss?
If you don't mind me asking.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.599
No, not at all. Um...

13:24.929 --> 13:28.058
I don't know. A long way away.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.816
I just sort of hitched a lift
with this man...

13:34.272 --> 13:38.823
I didn't even think about it.
Don't even know who he is.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.456
He's a complete stranger.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.708
Anyway,
don't let me keep you. Good luck with it!

13:49.120 --> 13:54.126
Thank you, miss.
And thank you for the permission.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.381
Not many people are
that considerate.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.304
Okay. See you later.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.143
Now, then.

14:08.222 --> 14:11.897
Control, I'm at junction 19.
I think the problem's coming from in here.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.899
I'll go inside and have a look.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.317
What's that?
Something in there?

14:19.067 --> 14:20.990
Ooh. Who are you, then?

14:21.402 --> 14:22.574
Hold on!

14:24.238 --> 14:27.583
If you're an upgrade,
I just need to register you, that's all.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.126
Oh, come back.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.706
Ah, there you are.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.545
Now, I just need
to register your ident.

14:36.918 --> 14:41.264
Aw, there's two of ya!
Got yourself a little mate?

14:43.466 --> 14:46.265
I think I'd better
report this to control.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.722
How many of you are there?

14:50.098 --> 14:51.520
What are you?

14:52.433 --> 14:55.186
Oh, no! No!

15:07.365 --> 15:09.333
- What's that?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.787
- Well, how should I know?

15:14.288 --> 15:18.543
Would the owner
of the blue box in private gallery 15

15:18.626 --> 15:21.095
please report to
the steward's office immediately.

15:22.547 --> 15:26.597
Guests are reminded
that the use of teleportation devices

15:26.676 --> 15:32.228
is strictly prohibited under
Peace Treaty 5.4/Cup/16. Thank you.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.982
Earth-death in 25 minutes.

15:36.060 --> 15:39.064
Earth-death in 25 minutes.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.241
Oh, thanks.

15:47.738 --> 15:48.990
Hello!

15:49.407 --> 15:52.877
My name's Rose.
That's a sort of plant.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.921
We might be related.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.842
I'm talking to a twig.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.983
Oi, now, careful with that,
park it properly. No scratches.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.591
Rose, are you in there?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.220
Aye-aye!

16:46.589 --> 16:49.889
- What d'you think, then?
- Great, yeah. Fine.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.891
Once you get past
the slightly psychic paper.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.768
They're just so alien!

16:59.852 --> 17:02.401
The aliens are so alien.

17:04.232 --> 17:07.202
You look at 'em,
and they're alien.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.779
Good thing I didn't take you
to the deep south.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.493
- Where are you from?
- All over the place.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.460
- They all speak English.
- No, you just hear English.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.791
It's a gift of the Tardis.
It's the telepathic field,

17:21.874 --> 17:24.002
gets inside your brain,
translates.

17:24.085 --> 17:27.055
- It's inside my brain?
- Well, in a good way.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.800
Your machine gets
inside my head?

17:29.882 --> 17:33.352
It gets inside and it changes my
mind and you didn't even ask.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.396
I didn't think
about it like that.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.896
No, you were too busy thinking up cheap
shots about the deep south!

17:40.017 --> 17:42.111
Who are you then, Doctor.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.068
What're you called?
What sort of alien are you?

17:45.147 --> 17:47.650
- I'm just a Doctor.
- From what planet?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.531
Well, it's not as if
you'd know where it is.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.533
- Where're you from?
- What does it matter?

17:51.612 --> 17:53.455
- Tell me who you are!
- This is who I am.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.078
Right here, right now.
All right?

17:55.157 --> 17:57.910
All that counts
is here and now, and this is me!

17:57.994 --> 18:02.295
Yeah, and I'm here too 'cause you
brought me here! So just tell me!

18:10.756 --> 18:13.930
Earth-death in 20 minutes.

18:15.386 --> 18:18.811
Earth-death in 20 minutes.

18:26.397 --> 18:27.865
All right.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.074
As my mate Shireen says,

18:32.153 --> 18:35.032
"Don't argue with
the designated driver."

18:37.199 --> 18:39.122
Can't exactly call for a taxi.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.875
There's no signal.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.716
We're out of range.
Just a bit.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.177
Tell you what,
with a little bit of jiggery-pokery...

18:51.255 --> 18:53.508
Is that a technical term,
"jiggery-pokery"?

18:53.591 --> 18:55.889
Yeah, I came first
in jiggery-pokery. What about you?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.517
- No, I failed hullabaloo.
- Aw.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.767
There you go.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.031
- Hello?
- Mum?

19:17.114 --> 19:20.493
Oh, what is it?
What's wrong? What have I done now?

19:20.576 --> 19:24.171
Ooh, this red top's falling
to bits! You should get your money back.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.123
Go on, there must be something.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.925
You never phone
in the middle of the day.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.298
- What's so funny?

19:30.378 --> 19:32.426
Nothing.
You all right, though?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.098
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

19:34.674 --> 19:39.350
- What day is it?
- Wednesday all day. You got a hangover?

19:39.428 --> 19:42.056
Oh, I tell you what,
put a quid in that lottery syndicate.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.561
I'll pay you back later.

19:43.641 --> 19:48.363
Yeah, um, I was just calling
'cause I might be late home.

19:48.729 --> 19:49.946
Is there something wrong?

19:50.231 --> 19:54.156
No, I'm fine.
Top of the world!

19:59.156 --> 20:02.706
If you think that's amazing,
you wanna see the bill.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.208
That was five billion
years ago.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.627
So...

20:07.707 --> 20:09.254
She's dead now.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.464
Five billion years later,
my mum's dead.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.386
Bundle of laughs, you are.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.773
That's not supposed to happen.

20:23.848 --> 20:27.603
Well, what was it?
I'm just getting green lights at this end.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.983
Honoured guests
may be reassured

20:30.062 --> 20:34.488
that gravity pockets
may cause slight turbulence. Thanking you.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.446
The whole place shook!
I felt it!

20:37.528 --> 20:41.249
I've hosted all sorts of events on
platforms one, three, six and fifteen

20:41.323 --> 20:43.542
and I've never felt
the slightest tremor!

20:43.617 --> 20:46.496
I warn you, if this lot
decide to sue...

20:46.579 --> 20:48.377
I'm gonna scan
the infrastructure.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.467
What's that?

20:56.547 --> 20:59.471
Control, I don't want to worry
you, but I'm picking up readings...

21:01.093 --> 21:05.815
I have no idea! They're small.
The scan says they're metal...

21:05.890 --> 21:08.393
I don't know what they look like!

21:11.270 --> 21:15.070
Although I imagine they might
look rather like that.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.866
You're not on the guest list.
How did you get on board?

21:27.912 --> 21:30.882
- No! No!
- Sunfilter deactivated.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.171
Sunfilter descending.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.586
Sunfilter up! No, no, no!

21:34.710 --> 21:37.429
External temperature
430 degrees.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.344
- Control! Respond!
- Sunfilter descending.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.767
- Sunfilter up!
- Sunfilter descending.

22:08.244 --> 22:12.294
That wasn't a gravity pocket. I know gravity
pockets, and they don't feel like that.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.375
What do you think, Jabe?

22:14.458 --> 22:16.699
Listen to the engines,
they're pitched up about 30 Hertz.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.345
Is that dodgy or what?

22:18.420 --> 22:21.094
It's the sound of metal,
that doesn't make any sense to me.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.845
- Where's the engine room?
- I don't know.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.727
But the maintenance duct is just behind our
guests' suite, I could show you.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.150
And your wife.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.735
Oh, she's not my wife.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.483
- Partner?
- No.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.947
- Concubine?
- Nope.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.114
Prostitute?

22:39.358 --> 22:42.157
Whatever I am,
it must be invisible! Do you mind?

22:42.778 --> 22:44.997
Tell you what,
you two go and pollinate.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.912
I'm gonna catch up
with the Family.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.868
Quick word
with Michael Jackson.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.249
Don't start a fight.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.046
I'm all yours.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.502
And I want you home
by midnight!

22:59.044 --> 23:04.346
Earth-death in 15
minutes. Earth-death in 75 minutes.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.855
Who's in charge of Platform One?
Has it got a captain or what?

23:17.980 --> 23:20.233
There's just the steward
and the staff.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.865
All the rest is controlled
by the metal mind.

23:22.985 --> 23:25.454
You mean, the computer?
Well, who controls that?

23:25.529 --> 23:26.997
The Corporation.

23:27.072 --> 23:30.872
They move Platform One
from one artistic event to another.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.587
Well, there's no one
from the Corporation on board.

23:33.662 --> 23:37.542
They're not needed.
This facility is purely automatic.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.384
It's the height of
the Alpha Class.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.970
- Nothing can go wrong.
- Unsinkable?

23:42.046 --> 23:45.300
If you like. The nautical
metaphor is appropriate.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.510
You're telling me!
I was on board another ship once.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.057
They said that was unsinkable.

23:49.178 --> 23:52.728
I ended up clinging to an iceberg.
It wasn't half cold.

23:52.848 --> 23:57.979
So, what you're saying is, if we get in
trouble, there's no one to help us out?

23:58.062 --> 24:00.565
- I'm afraid not.
- Fantastic!

24:01.565 --> 24:05.365
I don't understand.
In what way is that fantastic?

24:11.075 --> 24:15.000
Soon the sun
will blossom into a red giant,

24:15.079 --> 24:17.047
and my home will die.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.714
That's where I used to live,
when I was a little boy. Down there.

24:20.834 --> 24:24.884
Mummy and Daddy had a house built into the
side of the Los Angeles Crevasse.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.349
I'd have such fun.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.510
What happened to everyone else?

24:29.593 --> 24:31.721
The human race,
where did it go?

24:32.596 --> 24:36.476
They say mankind has touched
every star in the sky.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.401
So you're not the last human.

24:39.019 --> 24:42.239
I am the last pure human.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.276
The others mingled.

24:45.776 --> 24:48.575
Oh, they call themselves
New-humans and Proto-humans

24:48.696 --> 24:50.744
and Digi-humans,
even Human-ish!

24:50.864 --> 24:53.367
But do you know
what I call them?

24:53.450 --> 24:54.793
Mongrels.

24:55.536 --> 24:58.085
Right. And you stayed behind.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.042
- I kept myself pure.
- Hmm.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.711
How many operations
have you had?

25:04.044 --> 25:09.050
708. Next week, it's 709.
I'm having my blood bleached.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.469
Is that why you wanted a word?

25:12.886 --> 25:15.059
You could be flatter, Rose.

25:15.139 --> 25:18.268
You've got a little bit
of a chin poking out.

25:18.392 --> 25:21.737
- I'd rather die.
- Honestly, it doesn't hurt.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.357
I mean it. I would rather die.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.661
It's better to die
than to live like you, a bitchy trampoline.

25:28.777 --> 25:31.280
Oh, well, what do you know?

25:32.114 --> 25:34.208
I was born on that planet!

25:34.283 --> 25:36.706
And so was my mum
and so was my dad.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.789
And that makes me, officially,
the last human being in this room.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.790
'Cause you're not human.

25:41.957 --> 25:46.007
You've had it all nipped and tucked and
ﬂattened till there's nothing left.

25:46.128 --> 25:47.926
Anything human
got chucked in the bin!

25:48.005 --> 25:51.350
You're just skin, Cassandra!
Lipstick and skin.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.636
Nice talking.

26:01.643 --> 26:06.570
So, tell me, Jabe, what's a tree like
you doing in a place like this?

26:06.648 --> 26:08.742
- Respect for the Earth.
- Come on!

26:08.817 --> 26:11.161
Everyone on this platform
is worth zillions!

26:11.236 --> 26:15.742
Well, perhaps it's a case of
having to be seen at the right occasions.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.667
In case your share prices drop?

26:17.743 --> 26:21.338
I know you lot. You've got massive forests
everywhere, roots everywhere!

26:21.413 --> 26:23.507
And there's
always money in land.

26:23.624 --> 26:25.251
All the same.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.928
We respect the Earth as family.

26:28.003 --> 26:31.928
So many species evolved from that planet.
Mankind is only one.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.429
I am another.

26:33.509 --> 26:37.013
My ancestors were transplanted
from the planet down below.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.270
And I'm a direct descendant
of the tropical rainforest.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.192
Excuse me.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.156
And what about your ancestry,
Doctor?

26:49.024 --> 26:51.823
Perhaps you could tell
a story or two.

26:53.529 --> 26:58.706
Perhaps a man only enjoys trouble
when there's nothing else left?

27:00.536 --> 27:02.538
I scanned you earlier.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.960
The metal machine had trouble
identifying your species.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.885
It refused to admit
your existence.

27:09.294 --> 27:12.639
And even when it named you,
I wouldn't believe it.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.683
But it was right.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.137
I know where you're from!

27:20.347 --> 27:24.397
Forgive me for intruding,
but it's remarkable that you even exist!

27:26.019 --> 27:28.067
I just want to say...

27:29.356 --> 27:31.404
how sorry I am.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.226
Is it me, or is it a bit nippy?

28:28.415 --> 28:30.793
Fair dos, though,
that's a great bit of air-conditioning.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.549
Sort of nice and old fashioned.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.130
Bet they call it retro.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.636
Gotcha!

28:43.805 --> 28:47.480
- What the hell is that?
- Is it part of the "retro"?

28:47.601 --> 28:49.820
I don't think so, hold on.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.497
- Hey, nice Liana!
- Thank you.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.245
Not supposed to
show them in public.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.668
Don't worry,
I won't tell anybody.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.542
Now, then, who's been
bringing their pets on board?

29:07.621 --> 29:09.749
- What does it do?
- Sabotage...

29:09.831 --> 29:12.254
Earth-death in 10 minutes...

29:12.334 --> 29:15.008
And the temperature's
about to rocket. Come on.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.387
The planet's end!

29:19.466 --> 29:21.935
Come gather, come gather!

29:22.010 --> 29:25.640
Bid farewell to the cradle
of civilisation.

29:25.722 --> 29:29.397
Let us mourn her
with a traditional ballad.

Earth-death in five minutes.

31:53.286 --> 31:55.709
The metal machine confirms...

31:55.789 --> 31:58.838
the spider devices
have infiltrated the whole of Platform One.

32:00.252 --> 32:03.426
How's that possible? Our private rooms

32:03.505 --> 32:05.724
Moisturise me, moisturise me.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.718
Summon the steward!

32:07.801 --> 32:09.553
I'm afraid the steward is dead.

32:14.307 --> 32:15.854
Who killed him?

32:15.934 --> 32:19.484
This whole event was sponsored
by the Face of Boe! He invited us.

32:19.563 --> 32:21.486
Talk to the face!
Talk to the face!

32:21.565 --> 32:24.660
Easy way of finding out.
Someone brought their little pet on board.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.529
Let's send him back to master.

32:49.050 --> 32:52.270
The Adherents of
the Repeated Meme!

32:52.387 --> 32:55.015
That's all very well
and really kinda obvious.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.226
But if you stop
and think about it...

32:59.019 --> 33:01.272
A Repeated Meme
is just an idea.

33:01.521 --> 33:03.819
And that's all they are,
an idea.

33:07.819 --> 33:11.824
Remote-control droids. Nice little
cover for the real troublemaker.

33:12.282 --> 33:14.410
Go on, Jimbo. Go home.

33:18.580 --> 33:21.675
I bet you were the school swot
and never got kissed.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.218
At arms!

33:23.418 --> 33:25.011
What you gonna do,
moisturise me?

33:25.128 --> 33:26.471
With acid.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.298
Oh, you're too late anyway.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.514
My spiders have control
of the main frame.

33:31.635 --> 33:36.641
Oh, you all carried them
as gifts, tax-free, past every code-wall.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.772
I'm not just a pretty face.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.775
Sabotaging a ship while you're still
inside it, how stupid is that?

33:42.938 --> 33:45.908
I'd hoped to manufacture
a hostage situation.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.030
With myself
as one of the victims.

33:48.818 --> 33:51.662
The compensation
would've been enormous.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.408
Five billion years,
and it still comes down to money.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.418
Do you think it's cheap,
looking like this?

33:57.494 --> 33:59.997
Flatness costs a fortune!

34:01.164 --> 34:02.916
I am the last human, Doctor.

34:03.750 --> 34:07.721
Me, not that
freaky little kid of yours.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.177
Arrest her! The infidel!

34:10.257 --> 34:14.558
Oh, shut it, pixie!
I've still got my final option.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.889
Earth-death in three minutes.

34:16.972 --> 34:21.273
And here it comes.
You're just as useful dead, all of you.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.149
I have shares in
your rival companies.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.447
And they'll triple in price
as soon as your dead.

34:27.107 --> 34:30.610
My spiders are primed
and ready to destroy the safety systems.

34:30.944 --> 34:33.618
How did that old Earth song go?

34:33.697 --> 34:35.199
"Burn baby, burn."

34:35.282 --> 34:36.875
Then you'll burn with us!

34:36.949 --> 34:39.123
Oh, I'm so sorry!

34:39.452 --> 34:44.208
I know the use of teleportation
is strictly forbidden, but...

34:44.291 --> 34:46.134
I'm such a naughty thing.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.761
Spiders, activate!

34:58.388 --> 35:02.643
Force-fields gone,
with the planet about to explode...

35:02.726 --> 35:04.353
At least it'll be quick.

35:04.728 --> 35:07.277
Just like my fifth husband...

35:07.355 --> 35:11.235
Oh, shame on me!
Bye-bye, darlings.

35:11.318 --> 35:14.117
- Safety systems failing.
- Bye-bye, my darlings!

35:14.738 --> 35:17.161
Heat levels rising.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.959
- Reset the computer!
- Only the steward would know how.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.878
No, we can do it by hand.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.957
There must be
a system restore switch. Jabe, come on!

35:25.040 --> 35:26.542
You lot, just chill.

35:26.666 --> 35:27.667
Heat levels rising.

35:32.339 --> 35:37.140
Earth-death in two minutes.
Earth-death in two minutes.

35:39.012 --> 35:44.439
Heat levels critical.
Heat levels critical.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.069
Oh, and guess
where the switch is.

35:51.066 --> 35:55.037
Heat levels rising.
Heat levels rising.

36:04.954 --> 36:09.300
External temperature
5,000 degrees.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.892
You can't, the heat's gonna
vent through this place.

36:21.971 --> 36:24.190
- I know.
- Jabe, you're made of wood.

36:24.265 --> 36:27.439
Then stop wasting time,
Time Lord.

36:30.730 --> 36:34.826
Heat levels rising.
Heat levels rising.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.788
Heat levels hazardous.

36:38.863 --> 36:42.538
- We're going to die!
- Heat levels hazardous.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.809
Shields malfunction.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.433
Shields malfunction.

37:04.806 --> 37:08.310
Shields malfunction.

37:08.393 --> 37:11.237
Shields malfunction.

37:16.818 --> 37:22.621
Heat levels critical.
Heat levels critical.

37:35.336 --> 37:40.058
Heat levels rising.
Heat levels rising.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.621
Planet explodes in...

38:10.538 --> 38:12.211
ten,

38:12.832 --> 38:14.425
nine,

38:16.044 --> 38:17.762
eight,

38:19.881 --> 38:21.428
seven,

38:23.301 --> 38:24.803
six,

38:27.180 --> 38:28.648
five,

38:30.433 --> 38:31.935
four...

38:35.522 --> 38:36.819
Raise shields!

38:37.774 --> 38:39.026
One.

38:55.542 --> 39:00.013
Exoglass repair.
Exoglass repair.

39:04.175 --> 39:08.851
Exoglass repair.
Exoglass repair.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.066
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.568
I'm full of ideas.
I'm bristling with 'em!

39:59.647 --> 40:03.117
Idea number one,
teleportation through 5,000 degrees

40:03.192 --> 40:05.035
needs some kind of feed.

40:05.111 --> 40:08.706
Idea number two.
This feed must be hidden nearby.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.624
Idea number three.

40:13.703 --> 40:18.083
If you're as clever as me,
then a teleportation-feed can be reversed.

40:19.542 --> 40:24.173
Oh, you should've seen
their little alien faces...

40:26.382 --> 40:28.760
- Oh.
- The last human.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.892
So, you passed
my little test. Bravo!

40:31.971 --> 40:35.145
This makes you eligible
to join the... the Human Club.

40:35.224 --> 40:38.068
People have died Cassandra,
you murdered them.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.317
It depends on your definition
of people!

40:40.396 --> 40:44.276
And that's enough of a technicality to keep
your lawyers dizzy for centuries!

40:44.359 --> 40:49.331
Take me to court then, Doctor,
and watch me smile and cry...

40:51.032 --> 40:52.784
- ...and ﬂutter.
- And creak?

40:53.326 --> 40:56.045
- And what?
- Creak! You're creaking.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.044
What?

40:59.123 --> 41:01.046
I'm drying out!

41:01.292 --> 41:05.047
Oh, sweet heavens!
Moisturise me, moisturise me!

41:05.129 --> 41:08.099
Where are my surgeons?
My lovely boys!

41:08.174 --> 41:11.053
- It's too hot!
- You raised the temperature.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.438
Have pity!

41:13.513 --> 41:15.231
Moisturise me!

41:15.306 --> 41:17.604
Oh, Doctor!

41:17.684 --> 41:19.186
Help her.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.817
Everything has its time
and everything dies.

41:22.647 --> 41:26.948
I'm too young!

41:39.789 --> 41:42.713
Shuttles four and six departing.

41:43.126 --> 41:46.630
This unit now closing
dawn for maintenance.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.984
The end of the Earth.

42:05.815 --> 42:07.488
It's gone.

42:10.403 --> 42:13.907
We were too busy
saving ourselves. No one saw it go.

42:18.536 --> 42:22.586
All those years, all that history,
and no one was even looking!

42:24.584 --> 42:26.586
It's just...

42:27.795 --> 42:29.138
Come with me.

43:12.381 --> 43:14.258
Big Issue!

43:15.510 --> 43:17.512
Big Issue!

43:17.845 --> 43:22.271
You think it'll last forever,
people and cars and concrete.

43:23.101 --> 43:25.103
But it won't.

43:25.186 --> 43:27.234
One day, it's all gone.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.782
Even the sky.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.449
My planet's gone.

43:39.826 --> 43:41.373
It's dead.

43:43.830 --> 43:45.798
It burned, like the Earth.

43:46.290 --> 43:48.418
It's just rocks and dust.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.845
Before its time.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.099
What happened?

43:57.301 --> 44:00.020
There was a war, and we lost.

44:00.096 --> 44:02.019
A war with who?

44:05.685 --> 44:07.608
What about your people?

44:09.147 --> 44:11.195
I'm a Time Lord.

44:11.274 --> 44:13.652
I'm the last of the Time Lords.

44:14.443 --> 44:17.868
They're all gone.
I'm the only survivor.

44:19.907 --> 44:22.160
I'm left travelling on my own
'cause there's no-one else.

44:23.995 --> 44:25.372
There's me.

44:29.292 --> 44:32.171
You've seen
how dangerous it is. Do you wanna go home?

44:36.382 --> 44:37.929
I don't know.

44:39.552 --> 44:41.395
I want...

44:44.599 --> 44:46.897
Oh. Can you smell chips?

44:47.727 --> 44:51.106
- Yeah! Yeah.
- I want chips.

44:51.355 --> 44:52.481
Me too!

44:52.565 --> 44:55.819
All right then, before you can get me in
that box, chips it is and you can pay.

44:56.569 --> 44:59.743
- No money.
- What sort of date are you?

44:59.822 --> 45:01.870
Come on then, tightwad.
Chips are on me.

45:03.409 --> 45:05.832
We've only got
five billion years till the shops close.

45:16.505 --> 45:18.803
Now, you've seen the future, so
let's have a look at the past.

45:18.883 --> 45:21.227
1860. How does 1860 sound?

45:21.302 --> 45:23.725
- What happened in 1860?
- I don't know! Let's find out.

45:25.514 --> 45:26.811
I can't believe she's gone.

45:26.891 --> 45:30.646
Not gone, Mr Redpath, sir.
Merely sleeping.

45:31.604 --> 45:33.777
She's up and on her feet
and out there somewhere!

45:33.856 --> 45:37.360
Mr Sneed, for shame,
how many more times? It's ungodly!

45:38.569 --> 45:40.617
Excuse me, sir.
Mr Dickens, this is your call.

45:41.030 --> 45:45.627
Use the sight.
Find the old lady or you're dismissed.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.334
What phantasmagoria is this?

45:51.249 --> 45:52.592
That's more like it!
