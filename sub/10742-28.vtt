You sent for me, sir?

01:11.504 --> 01:13.671
       Oh, yes, Major Nelson.
   I have an assignment for you.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.740
An assignment?
Well, I'm already working

01:15.775 --> 01:17.408
on the ballistic-
control simulator.

01:17.444 --> 01:18.576
  Well, for the next few days,

01:18.611 --> 01:20.478
       you're going to be
        working on this.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.751
Well, well, well.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.521
     She's a lot prettier than
  a ballistic-control simulator.

         Uh, I don't understand.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.758
Well, I'm going to
explain it to you.

The Princess Tarji

01:34.795 --> 01:36.528
is the daughter of
the sultan of Pakuait.

The United States is very
anxious to make a deal

01:38.532 --> 01:40.365

tracking station there.

                         Uh-huh.

The princess is on her way
for her first trip to America.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.739
         And the sultan
      has indicated to us

01:47.774 --> 01:50.475
that it would please him
    if we saw to it

01:50.511 --> 01:52.811
that she had a good time
  while she was here.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.513
      Naturally,
we want to please him.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.615
Uh, do you follow me, major?

01:56.650 --> 01:58.883
     Yes, sir. I think I'm ahead
    of you, as a matter of fact.

                  Uh, why me?

02:00.754 --> 02:03.255
Now, that's exactly what
I said to General Peterson.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.756
    Why you?

02:04.792 --> 02:07.425
But he feels
you're the man for the job

02:07.460 --> 02:09.526
and General Peterson is not
one to be argued with.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.196
                Yes, I-- I know.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.732
However, if you prefer
not to show the princess around

02:13.767 --> 02:14.966
while she's in Cocoa Beach,

02:15.002 --> 02:16.834

General Peterson that.

                Just work, sir.

              I can clear it up.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.252
Good. Uh, here is a dossier
on the princess and her family.

02:34.287 --> 02:35.954
It will fill you in
with her background.
