(SIGHS)

00:41.583 --> 00:42.917
(GASPS)

00:44.544 --> 00:45.754
Dad?

01:16.242 --> 01:17.827
Dad?

02:02.247 --> 02:03.456
Ellie?

02:05.417 --> 02:06.835
I just saw my dad.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.545
-What?
-I just saw my dad in my room.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.174
Where are you going?

02:13.258 --> 02:15.677
Yeah, I was, um...

02:15.759 --> 02:18.680
I was going to knock
on your door but I didn't
want to disturb you.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.182
You think sneaking
out the front door
wouldn't disturb me?

02:21.266 --> 02:25.770
I thought I'd save you trying
to write something witty
in the leaving card.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.689
Look,
I spoke to my friend Laura

02:27.772 --> 02:30.108
and she said
I can stay with her until
I find something long-term.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.610
-Is this about the abortion?
-No.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.947
Max, I just...
I just want to
get on with my life.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.450
Eve was trying to
tell me who I am
and now I know.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.868
You don't know
why it happened.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.369
You don't know why
Joseph kept you hidden...

02:41.453 --> 02:43.246
No. I know enough!

02:45.498 --> 02:48.835
(SCOFFS) Well, good for you.

02:48.918 --> 02:52.839
My dad who's been
dead for 15 years
was just sitting on my bed.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.469
You have to tell
me what he wants.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.816
I don't know why
I'm doing this, Max.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.241
MAX: That wasn't there before.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.910
Look at that.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.248
I lost this. This is unreal.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.878
-Is that your dad?
-Yeah.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.255
He left this for
me and before...

03:36.758 --> 03:38.008
he left this.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.055
He was wearing this
when he was killed.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.475
The hospital gave it to me.
I never look at this.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.727
Not anymore.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.814
Remember I told you I saw him
right after he died?

03:50.897 --> 03:55.151
Well, he was sat on my bed
exactly the way
he was just now.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.736
I mean...

03:59.989 --> 04:01.491
is he here now?

04:02.742 --> 04:03.910
No.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.667
Please.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.837
-Max.
-Even if you can't see him yet

04:13.920 --> 04:15.422
it might spark off something,
a vision...

04:15.505 --> 04:16.798
I know.

04:19.134 --> 04:22.387
Listen, I I think that...

04:22.470 --> 04:24.889
maybe you
wanted this to happen
a bit too much.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.933
Your dad was
never in the asylum.

04:27.015 --> 04:28.517
But then, you thought
you'd never been here...

04:28.601 --> 04:31.021
Sorry, Max, I can't help you.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.565
I don't want to
get your hopes up.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.067
Yeah, well,
it's a bit late for that.

04:36.151 --> 04:39.362
I've been
wanting this every day
since I was eight years old.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.576
I hardly have any pictures
of the two of us.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.619
And I think this
is the only one.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.706
Oh, well,
I'm glad you found it again.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.959
-I didn't just find it, did I?
-Well, I'm just saying.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.837
It is a precious picture,
maybe that's all it should be.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.257
Ellie, there was no reason
for this to turn up like that.

04:59.341 --> 05:03.011
Look, I don't want to
put any pressure on you.

05:05.513 --> 05:09.601
Just hold it in your hands.
I mean, see what happens.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.312
Don't be afraid
of letting me down.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.400
I can hold the end,
if it helps.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.153
Not really.

05:31.831 --> 05:32.957
Yeah?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.422
No.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.386
-You sure?
-Very.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.181
Let's try
something else, yeah?

05:53.228 --> 05:55.146
Where have you been?

06:02.445 --> 06:04.614
He had a blackout.
He didn't know I was there.

06:04.698 --> 06:08.827
He just... He just got up
and started walking.

06:08.910 --> 06:12.163
There's these tunnels under
the building.
I followed him and...

06:14.290 --> 06:16.751
-I think I saw Kate.
-How?

06:18.044 --> 06:19.713
KIERA: Has someone hurt her?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.464
-I don't know if
it was her body.
-What?

06:21.548 --> 06:22.799
It just looked like her.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.468
You saw a body?
You've got to call the police.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.762
I need to be sure
about what I saw.

06:31.766 --> 06:32.934
Here.

06:40.692 --> 06:44.112
What happened to your dad?

06:44.195 --> 06:47.490
You're probably
going to find out
in a few seconds.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.167
-Max, I'm sorry. Nothing.
-But... No, give it a try.

06:57.249 --> 07:00.211
I don't want to see any more
ghosts, I don't want to
have any more visions!

07:00.295 --> 07:02.088
Is that why
you're running away?

07:02.172 --> 07:04.215
I just found out
that I spent
the first years of my life

07:04.299 --> 07:07.676
kept in a cage by
some twisted sadist.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.179
Wouldn't you want to run?

07:10.764 --> 07:14.809
-Please.
-Max, I can't. I'm sorry.

07:14.893 --> 07:18.396
Okay.
Now you got what you wanted.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.486
I am happy for you.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.489
Liar.
I'll just get
the rest of my stuff.

(DOOR CLOSES)

07:46.633 --> 07:48.343
Eve...

07:56.768 --> 07:58.687
-You still shouldn't go.
-Max.

07:58.769 --> 08:02.357
Look, I'm not asking you
to stay for me. I mean,
you owe it to yourself.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.858
You came here
looking for answers

08:03.942 --> 08:06.152
and you won't be satisfied
until you find out everything.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.905
-It's just the way you are.
-I am satisfied.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.031
You're braver than that.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.241
-Am I?
-Yeah.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.909
I spent six
months seeing ghosts

08:12.992 --> 08:14.911
before I decided to do
anything about it.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.247
Yeah, and then you gave up
your whole life to come here.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.126
-I was suspended from my job.
-Even so,
you still chose to be here.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.877
Well,
it didn't feel like a choice.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.171
(SCOFFS) Neither does this!

08:25.255 --> 08:27.549
I mean, I don't think
you've thought this through.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.509
Thanks for your concern.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.885
How are you going to feel
when there's no
one you can talk to

08:30.969 --> 08:32.679
about anything that
really matters, huh?

Why did you go to that place?

09:14.387 --> 09:17.515
-I saw you.
-I don't know.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.726
I had a blackout.

You knew she was there.
Did you put her there?

-What?
-Warren, did you kill her?

09:26.066 --> 09:29.319
No! Of course not.
I'd never hurt
my own daughter.

You just said,
"It was my fault."
Why? Why was it your fault?

09:34.783 --> 09:36.368
Warren, come on.
I told you the truth about me.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.744
It was Joseph!

-Who's Joseph?
-Joseph Bayle. He worked here.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.959
He was an evil, evil man.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.462
Warren,
that was 20-odd years ago.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.590
He made people think
he could
communicate with the dead.

09:50.674 --> 09:55.720
And then he used it
to terrorize them.
Not just the inmates.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.808
-He's come back for revenge.
-Revenge for what?

10:00.725 --> 10:03.144
You wouldn't understand.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.647
He did some terrible,
terrible things.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.691
So why didn't you stop him?

10:07.774 --> 10:10.360
When I found out,
I did stop him.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.907
(SOBBING) But it was too late.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.494
Too late for what?

10:19.577 --> 10:23.123
-And this is definitely him?
-It must be.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.625
But I thought he was dead.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.795
So how could it be him?
How do you know?

10:28.878 --> 10:30.964
'Cause this is what he does.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.258
Warren,
this doesn't make sense.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.552
He kills girls.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.982
You're not leaving?

10:49.065 --> 10:50.984
-Yeah.
-Why?

10:51.067 --> 10:53.862
Well, it was only
supposed to be temporary.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.489
Has Warren said
something to upset you?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.783
-Like what?
-Has he spoken to you?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.702
What exactly are
you getting at?

it was me who told him
you've got the same symbol

-he has on his arm.
-Sorry?

11:07.334 --> 11:09.085
I apologize if I
spoke out of turn.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.420
I didn't think
it was a big deal.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.671
But the way he reacted
was so weird.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.173
Why? What did he say about me?

11:13.256 --> 11:15.091
It wasn't what he said,
it's the way he reacted.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.968
What did he say about me?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.304
Nothing.

I don't believe you.

-He's part of

-Yeah, and you know this how?

talking to Kiera about me.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.259
But then,
why would he keep evidence?

12:39.342 --> 12:41.928
It was all about covering up
and secrecy.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.389
Yeah, but Warren
might not have known
anything about you.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.808
But Kiera said
that he acted weird
when she mentioned me.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.893
Yeah, Warren and weird
kind of go hand in hand.

Well, she wouldn't have
mentioned me unless she was
freaked out by it.

she stumbled across something
that he thought

ever find out about.

No, I can't.

15:51.034 --> 15:54.287
-I don't think I
can do this, Max.
-Why?

15:54.371 --> 15:55.955
You need to go on your own,

15:56.039 --> 15:59.376
if your dad wants to
get through to you,
then he will.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.836
I'm sorry but this is nothing
to do with me.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.172
How can you say that?

16:04.255 --> 16:06.758
Why hasn't he showed himself
to you again?

16:06.841 --> 16:08.176
He knows you're waiting.

16:08.259 --> 16:11.805
He knows that I've got someone
who can help me.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.474
And maybe that's
why he came today.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.685
'Cause he knows I'm
going to lose you.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.620
I think we might be close.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.875
Max, this is it.
That's the sun dial
that I saw in my vision.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.711
I could see it
in the distance.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.839
What do you mean?
Where did you see it from?

16:48.758 --> 16:52.721
I don't know.
It felt like it was from here.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.393
You all right?

17:00.145 --> 17:01.980
It's Eve.

17:02.063 --> 17:05.025
She's here now.
She's standing
right in front of us.

17:05.108 --> 17:08.111
Why is she here, Max?
I thought she did
what she came for.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.532
Eve, I know who I am.
I know I'm you.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.492
I don't know.
Maybe she wants something.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.163
What is it you want, Eve?

17:18.246 --> 17:19.998
Look,
we've got to keep moving!

17:20.080 --> 17:24.294
I know that you
want to find your dad
but this isn't just about him.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.630
Eve, if you want something
I can try to help you.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.842
But you can't keep
following me around
for the rest of my life.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.886
-Ellie?
-What?

17:32.969 --> 17:35.055
There's a door.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.557

coming out of the darkness
into the light, right?

17:37.640 --> 17:38.933

-Kate?

Oh, God. Um...

18:54.467 --> 18:57.762
Um, what happened to her?

18:59.848 --> 19:01.182
He said...

19:02.600 --> 19:04.269
He told me there was
someone called Joseph

19:04.352 --> 19:06.896
who used to
work in the asylum.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.898
He says he's come back.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.693
And he's saying
this man killed Kate?

19:11.776 --> 19:13.611
Warren says
he's after revenge.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.239
Revenge? What for?

19:17.782 --> 19:19.200
I don't know.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.578
So he knows its revenge
but he doesn't know why?

19:21.661 --> 19:24.039
That's what he's saying.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.540
And what are you saying?

19:27.709 --> 19:30.170
'Cause I know what I'm saying.

19:31.963 --> 19:35.091
-You can't
seriously believe him?
-I don't know!

19:35.175 --> 19:39.262
Just because he's fed you
some bullshit story.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.682
Clearly he's lost his mind
and killed her.

19:44.309 --> 19:47.062

called the police?

19:47.145 --> 19:49.105

if he had, right?

36:27.062 --> 36:30.190
Let's just say there's guilt
where it's needed.

36:30.273 --> 36:32.859
An employee from 20 years ago
just did his best
to suffocate me.

36:32.942 --> 36:34.486
I mean, I thought you might be
a bit surprised.

36:34.569 --> 36:37.030
-He's done worse!
-Oh, nice.

36:37.113 --> 36:39.240
Why'd he attack me, though?

36:39.324 --> 36:41.284
Just get me out of the way
so he could get to Ellie?

36:41.368 --> 36:43.536
-It doesn't make sense.
Warren!
-What?

36:44.746 --> 36:47.082
You know about her, don't you?

36:47.165 --> 36:50.627
You know what happened to her
when she was a baby.

36:50.710 --> 36:52.587
Why did they
bring her down here,
Warren?

36:52.671 --> 36:56.424
I didn't know it was her.
It was a long time ago.

36:56.508 --> 36:59.886
See? I think you do know.
I mean, I would've
believed you before...

36:59.969 --> 37:01.012
I don't care what you believe.

37:01.096 --> 37:02.972
Yeah,
did you ever care about her?

37:03.056 --> 37:06.601
Or did you just stand by
and watch as Joseph took her
away from her mother?

37:06.685 --> 37:08.937
Did you know who she was
when she got here?

37:09.020 --> 37:10.522
Do you want to
save her or not?

37:10.605 --> 37:12.232
(SOBBING)

37:12.315 --> 37:15.568
I worked hard
to get this place just the way
you liked it, Eve.

37:15.652 --> 37:17.320
Stop calling me Eve.
My name's Ellie.

37:17.404 --> 37:20.115
-I named you Eve.
-I'm Ellie!

37:20.198 --> 37:22.117
I made you.

37:23.743 --> 37:28.915
I had a hard life
before you
brought comfort to it.

37:28.998 --> 37:30.834
Well, I never meant to.

37:32.127 --> 37:34.546
I know what to do.

37:34.629 --> 37:38.049
Let's swap memories, hmm?

37:46.808 --> 37:47.934
(GRUNTING)

37:54.983 --> 37:56.484
(SOBBING)

37:56.568 --> 37:57.736
(JOSEPH MURMURING)

38:00.363 --> 38:01.531
(GRUNTING)

38:04.451 --> 38:06.828
Joseph!
Joseph, for God's sake,
let her go.

38:08.496 --> 38:11.041
You knew and you
let him do this to me.

38:11.124 --> 38:13.877
No, Ellie, I didn't.
I didn't know you were Eve.

38:13.960 --> 38:16.338
Warren,
awful to hear about Kate.

38:16.421 --> 38:19.215
I'm going to kill you.
Properly this time.

38:19.299 --> 38:20.633
You took Eve.

38:20.717 --> 38:23.595
Remember the rule that kept
the scum in check?

38:23.678 --> 38:27.057
-An eye for an eye...
-You didn't need an excuse.

38:27.140 --> 38:30.727
I know about Zoe.
All the other
girls who disappeared.

38:30.810 --> 38:33.396
Losing you left
a hole in my life.

38:33.480 --> 38:36.566
And it turned out,
no one could take her place.

38:36.649 --> 38:38.651
Don't you dare
put that down to me.

38:38.735 --> 38:40.820
You were at it years
before she was even born.

38:40.904 --> 38:42.614
Get that knife away from her.

38:42.697 --> 38:44.240
Put it down now!

38:44.324 --> 38:47.494
Your Dad died
after 43 minutes,

38:47.577 --> 38:50.246
with a steering column
through his pancreas,

38:50.330 --> 38:55.168
begging for you, your mum
and for death, in that order.

38:55.251 --> 38:58.463
Is that really what you wanted
all these years?

38:59.255 --> 39:00.799
(GRUNTS)

39:00.882 --> 39:02.217
WARREN: Ellie!

39:03.218 --> 39:04.386
Get out! Now!

39:04.469 --> 39:06.179
-(GROANING)
-MAX: Ellie, come on!

39:08.640 --> 39:10.350
This is the end, Joseph.

39:15.647 --> 39:16.898
(PANTING)

39:20.485 --> 39:21.653
You okay?

40:03.278 --> 40:06.489
Don't be afraid.
I've come to get
you out of here.

40:15.790 --> 40:20.628
-What was he, Ellie?
A ghost? Human?
-I don't know.

40:35.310 --> 40:38.188
I killed you.
How did you come back?

40:55.663 --> 40:58.208
(SIREN WAILING)

40:59.709 --> 41:02.337
Warren saved me
when I was a little girl.

41:03.296 --> 41:05.799
He rescued me from Joseph.

41:05.882 --> 41:07.550
So, he wasn't one of them.

41:10.011 --> 41:13.264
-Warren Bettany?
-I'm Dan. I'm his son.

41:13.348 --> 41:14.808
Look, I've just seen him.

41:14.891 --> 41:17.310
He's in the basement through
the door in the outhouse. Go.

41:31.324 --> 41:34.160
I knew Joseph was my dad
before he told me.

41:35.745 --> 41:37.872
I could just see
it in my vision.

41:41.209 --> 41:42.627
Pure evil.

41:46.631 --> 41:48.508
That's who I came from.

41:52.137 --> 41:53.805
-It's okay.
-(SOBBING)

41:55.682 --> 41:57.100
It's okay, yeah?

42:04.149 --> 42:05.525
Is this him?

42:07.944 --> 42:09.279
Oh, God.

42:14.743 --> 42:18.663
Can you confirm
this is Warren Bettany?
Sir?

42:26.880 --> 42:28.548
I'm sorry about your dad.

42:30.342 --> 42:31.760
You were spot-on.

42:33.094 --> 42:35.513
I just wanted it too much.

42:35.597 --> 42:39.476
Well, don't give up hope.
He'll come.

42:39.559 --> 42:42.062
How's that going to happen
without you around?

42:42.145 --> 42:44.481
Just trust your instincts.

42:44.564 --> 42:46.232
You'll know when it's real.

42:50.862 --> 42:53.573
Oh, my God,
it's Warren, not Joseph.

42:58.495 --> 43:00.330
They found
a suicide note on him.

43:02.123 --> 43:03.958
He's left all this to me.

43:17.222 --> 43:19.057
Why would Warren
commit suicide, huh?

43:19.140 --> 43:21.017
He didn't. Joseph did this.

43:22.268 --> 43:23.853
He's still out there.

43:26.231 --> 43:27.774
I'm the only one
who can stop him.

43:27.857 --> 43:30.276
I'm going to make him wish
he never had a daughter.

43:31.695 --> 43:35.240
-Are you staying?
-You coming?

43:36.866 --> 43:38.076
Yeah.
