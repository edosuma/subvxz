JEN'S YOUR PRODUCER.

00:04.959 --> 00:06.208
YEAH. YEAH. I MEAN, YOU'RE BUSY.

00:08.375 --> 00:10.208
I HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED
THE BLACK SHEEP OF MY FAMILY.

00:10.208 --> 00:13.000
I COULD BRING HOME
THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE,

00:13.000 --> 00:15.041
AND IT WOULDN'T MAKE
THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

00:15.041 --> 00:17.291
LET ME POSE FOR YOU.
YOU WANT TO POSE FOR ME NAKED?

00:17.291 --> 00:18.625
I SHOULD JUST
GIVE YOU THIS AND GO.

00:21.667 --> 00:22.708
TELL HER I WAS
OVERWHELMED

00:22.708 --> 00:24.667
BY HER TALENT

00:24.667 --> 00:25.959
SO WAS I.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.375
I CAN BE YOUR
FATHER, DAWSON,

00:27.375 --> 00:29.667
AND, IF YOU'LL LET ME,
YOUR FRIEND.

00:29.667 --> 00:30.250
YOUR CALL.

00:34.458 --> 00:37.500
YOU KNOW, I THINK DARTS
MAY BE MY DESTINY, DAWSON.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.834
TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD

00:38.834 --> 00:41.041
AS AN INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED
MASTER OF THE DARTS.

OVER THERE?

00:47.166 --> 00:48.542
HEY, I'VE REWATCHED
A BUNCH OF MOVIES

00:48.542 --> 00:49.875
THAT I THINK
REALLY DELVE

00:49.875 --> 00:51.583
INTO SOME COMPLICATED
RELATIONSHIPS.

00:51.583 --> 00:53.041
I'M TRYING TO,
YOU KNOW,

00:53.041 --> 00:55.458
FIND SOME COMPLEXITIES
IN THE CHARACTERS IN MY MOVIE,

00:55.458 --> 00:58.375
LAYER THEM
A LITTLE BIT.

01:01.875 --> 01:03.792
WHAT'S THE GREAT
SANTINI?

01:03.792 --> 01:06.917
CLASSIC DYSFUNCTIONAL
FATHER-SON RELATIONSHIP.

01:06.917 --> 01:08.875
IT'S A FATHER WHO THINKS
HIS SON'S A SCREW-UP, HUH?

01:08.875 --> 01:11.333
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.667
YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN SKIP
THE BLOCKBUSTER MOMENT, DAWSON.

01:13.667 --> 01:15.875
YOU'RE GOING TO GET PLENTY
OF INSIGHT INTO THAT

01:15.875 --> 01:17.875
ON OUR LITTLE FISHING TRIP
THIS WEEKEND.

01:17.875 --> 01:19.583
OH, COME ON.

01:19.583 --> 01:21.834
GRANTED, YOUR FATHER'S
A LITTLE INTENSE, BUT, YOU KNOW,

01:21.834 --> 01:23.333

01:25.375 --> 01:26.750
OFF HIS SON'S HEAD

01:26.750 --> 01:28.875
AT LEAST YOUR FATHER RESPECTS
YOU ENOUGH NOT TO DO THAT.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.417
AH, YES, RESPECT.

01:31.417 --> 01:33.750
DO YOU RESPECT
YOUR FATHER, DAWSON?

01:33.750 --> 01:34.959
I'D HATE TO LIVE IN A WORLD
WHERE I DIDN'T.

01:34.959 --> 01:37.417
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER.

01:37.417 --> 01:38.917
DO YOU RESPECT YOUR FATHER?

01:38.917 --> 01:40.166
OH, WELL, I MEAN...

01:40.166 --> 01:41.583

ACROSS THE STREET.

01:49.834 --> 01:52.000
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
NOT RESPECT A MAN LIKE THAT?

01:52.000 --> 01:52.250
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER EITHER.

01:54.792 --> 01:58.875
A GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED
FATHER-SON FISHING TRIP.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.625
WHY DO I SENSE DISASTER?

02:02.834 --> 02:04.583
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

02:04.583 --> 02:05.792
WHY DON'T WE

02:05.792 --> 02:06.959

OBVIOUSLY KIDDING.

JUST PUTTING OUT FIRES
BEFORE THEY EVEN IGNITE.

05:09.250 --> 05:12.959
HMM. WELL, SHE'S NEVER WORKED
IN A FILM IN THIS CAPACITY.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.542
I MEAN, HOW DOES SHE
EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO?

05:14.542 --> 05:16.291

SPEAKS THEIR MIND

BOUNDLESS, MYSTERIOUS.

07:00.125 --> 07:03.333
I'LL TELL YOU, LIFE AT SEA
IS AS ROMANTIC AS LOVE.

07:03.333 --> 07:06.417
KIND OF MAKES YOU WANT
TO CHUCK IT ALL AND BECOME
A FISHERMAN, YOU KNOW?

07:06.417 --> 07:08.458
YOU THINK FISH IS
A VIABLE CAREER OPTION FOR YOU?

07:08.458 --> 07:09.542
OH, MAYBE.

FORGOT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING YESTERDAY,

07:28.375 --> 07:30.875

A GREAT IDEA, JEN.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.750

DON'T YOU THINK?

08:52.583 --> 08:54.250
I GUESS MY LITTLE
SECRET'S OUT.

08:57.041 --> 08:59.792
THEY DON'T EXACTLY
CALL ME ISHMAEL.

08:59.792 --> 09:03.083
YOU GET IT?
ISHMAEL? MOBY DICK?

09:03.083 --> 09:05.375
YEAH. I READ IT.

09:05.375 --> 09:07.750
RIGHT.

09:07.750 --> 09:10.750
YEAH, WELL, THIS IS
GOING TO BE A FUN WEEKEND.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.667
SO WHY'D YOU COME, JACK?

09:12.667 --> 09:16.458
LOOK, DAWSON, I DIDN'T
REALIZE YOU WERE
GOING TO BE HERE.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.208
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR ME TO MAKE AN EXIT
NOW, AND, UM...

09:18.208 --> 09:20.708
SURVIVE, SO...

09:20.708 --> 09:24.125
WHY DON'T YOU AND I
TRY TO DEAL WITH
OUR LITTLE PROBLEM.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.291
THERE'S NO PROBLEM HERE, JACK.

09:25.291 --> 09:28.208
I--I'M JUST...

09:28.208 --> 09:29.250
AMAZED AT YOUR CONFIDENCE.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.917
YOU KNOW...

09:31.917 --> 09:35.083
TO LEAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND
ALONE THIS WHOLE WEEKEND

09:35.083 --> 09:36.542
THIS EARLY ON
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP,

09:36.542 --> 09:38.375
WHILE THINGS ARE STILL NEW
AND--AND VULNERABLE,

09:38.375 --> 09:40.041
AND YOU'RE STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT,

09:40.041 --> 09:41.417
BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT ABOUT NOW
THAT SOME NEW GUY,

09:41.417 --> 09:46.625
SOME BUMBLING, NAIVE, ARTSY-TYPE
IS JUST GOING TO COME ALONG

09:46.625 --> 09:48.667
AND STEAL HER AWAY
RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER YOUR NOSE.

09:48.667 --> 09:49.750
AND TRUST ME...THAT SUCKS.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.875
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE

10:10.875 --> 10:13.125
FACING TEENAGERS TODAY?

10:13.125 --> 10:14.625
JOEY?

10:23.166 --> 10:23.875
ANYONE ELSE?

10:28.708 --> 10:31.917
JEN, COULD I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

10:31.917 --> 10:31.959
YEAH, SURE, GALE.

10:38.542 --> 10:39.959
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS
ALL AFTERNOON,

10:39.959 --> 10:42.625
AND WE'VE STILL
GOT NOTHING.

10:42.625 --> 10:45.917
DO YOU THINK THE FORMALITY'S
MAKING EVERYBODY UNCOMFORTABLE?

10:45.917 --> 10:47.959
I THINK THAT JUST HAVING
EVERYBODY IN ONE ROOM

10:47.959 --> 10:50.834
IS MAKING EVERYBODY
UNCOMFORTABLE.

10:50.834 --> 10:53.083
THAT CAMERA EQUIPMENT
LOOKS REALLY HEAVY.

10:53.083 --> 10:54.625

20:45.959 --> 20:47.708
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE FOR YOU,
IS IT, DAWSON?

20:47.708 --> 20:49.667
YOU CAN JUST GO UP
TO YOUR DAD AND SAY,

20:49.667 --> 20:51.208
"GEE WHIZ, POP,
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.458
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS
HEART-TO-HEART, MAN-TO-MAN."

20:53.458 --> 20:56.875
THAT'S YOUR
WONDERFUL LIFE, NOT MINE.

20:56.875 --> 20:58.000
YOU'VE GOTTEN A GLIMPSE
INTO THE HELL THAT IS MY LIFE.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.041
SO WHY IS MY MERE PRESENCE

21:00.041 --> 21:02.375
SUDDENLY A DETRIMENT
TO YOUR HAPPINESS?

21:02.375 --> 21:04.750
BECAUSE MR. WITTER'S PUT YOU UP
ON SUCH A TOWERING PEDESTAL

21:04.750 --> 21:07.041
THAT YOU'RE A WHAT,
MERE PRESENCE, DAWSON?

21:07.041 --> 21:09.625
COME ON. IT'S AN ICON PACEY
CAN'T POSSIBLY LIVE UP TO.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.166
IT'S YOUR SHOT.

21:20.375 --> 21:22.417
ADULTS IDEALIZE THEIR
CHILDHOOD,

21:22.417 --> 21:23.708
AND THAT LEADS TO CENSORSHIP.

21:23.708 --> 21:24.917
THANK YOU, ABBY.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.208
SO, ANDIE,

21:27.208 --> 21:29.208
WHY DO YOU THINK TEENAGE GIRLS
ARE SUCH TREND-SETTERS?

21:29.208 --> 21:31.250
WELL--
Abby: WELL, IT'S NOT BECAUSE

21:31.250 --> 21:32.583
THEY'RE SO CUTTING-EDGE.
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE INSECURE,

21:32.583 --> 21:34.500
AND POPULAR CULTURE
CAPITALIZES ON THAT.

21:34.500 --> 21:37.542
GIRLS THINK, "IF I GO OUT
AND BUY THIS LIPSTICK,

21:37.542 --> 21:39.792
"OR IF I WATCH
THAT TV SHOW

21:39.792 --> 21:41.125
"OR LISTEN
TO THIS MUSIC,

21:41.125 --> 21:42.417
I'LL BE POPULAR."

21:42.417 --> 21:44.458
I MEAN, LOOK
AROUND THIS ROOM.

21:44.458 --> 21:45.667
EVERY ONE
OF THESE GIRLS

21:45.667 --> 21:47.291
IS INCREDIBLY
INSECURE.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.208
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN
SPEAK MY MIND ANYMORE

21:49.208 --> 21:50.667
WITHOUT STOMPING
ON SOMEBODY'S FEELINGS.

21:50.667 --> 21:54.583
I MAKE A CANCER JOKE,
AND JOEY GETS UPSET,

21:54.583 --> 21:56.375
OR I MAKE
A CRAZY JOKE,

21:56.375 --> 21:57.500
AND ANDIE GETS UPSET,

21:57.500 --> 21:59.291
OR YOU MAKE A CRACK
ABOUT HO-BAGS,

21:59.291 --> 22:00.166
AND JEN STARTS
HUMPING THE COUCH.

22:00.166 --> 22:03.083
OH, SCREW YOU, ABBY.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.208
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

22:04.208 --> 22:06.333
OKAY, STOP ROLLING, PERRY.

22:06.333 --> 22:09.834
ABBY, I THINK THAT WE'VE HEARD
ENOUGH OF YOUR OPINIONS,

22:09.834 --> 22:11.542
SO THANK YOU FOR COMING.

22:11.542 --> 22:13.542
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO LEAVE?

22:13.542 --> 22:16.917
UH, YOU CAN'T
BE KICKING ME OUT,

22:16.917 --> 22:18.667
BECAUSE WHAT ABOUT SISTERHOOD

22:18.667 --> 22:20.208
AND ALL THAT BUNK
ABOUT FEMALE BONDING?

22:20.208 --> 22:21.708
GOOD NIGHT, ABBY.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.959
WHAT KIND OF
JOURNALIST ARE YOU?

22:23.959 --> 22:25.333
OH, I KNOW,
A TRASHY ONE

22:25.333 --> 22:26.667
THAT SLEEPS AROUND.

22:29.333 --> 22:29.625
[DOOR SLAMS]

22:41.792 --> 22:44.667
HEY.

22:52.166 --> 22:56.083
HEY, DAD?

22:56.083 --> 22:57.959
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

22:57.959 --> 22:59.750
WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D JUST SLEEP RIGHT OUT HERE

22:59.750 --> 23:01.041
UNDER THE STARS.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.041
I MEAN, WITH, YOU KNOW...

23:03.041 --> 23:06.041
WITH THE RESTAURANT,

23:06.041 --> 23:07.750
AND, UM, YOUR LIFE.

23:07.750 --> 23:10.041
OH.

23:10.041 --> 23:12.166
I WISH I KNEW.

23:12.166 --> 23:15.083
ARE YOU OKAY FOR MONEY?

23:16.208 --> 23:19.458
YEAH, FOR NOW.

23:27.375 --> 23:29.291
I'VE GOT
TO BE HONEST.

23:29.291 --> 23:30.291
I MEAN, UH...

23:30.291 --> 23:32.625
AS GLAD AS I AM THAT
WE CAN HAVE THIS...

23:32.625 --> 23:35.375
THIS FATHER-SON
BONDING MOMENT,

23:35.375 --> 23:38.208
I'D THINK A WEEKEND
FISHING TRIP

23:38.208 --> 23:40.417
WOULD BE THE LEAST
OF YOUR PRIORITIES.

23:40.417 --> 23:44.083
I MEAN, SHOULDN'T YOU
BE OUT TRYING TO...

23:44.083 --> 23:46.458
PROCURE SOME KIND
OF EMPLOYMENT,

23:46.458 --> 23:48.083
OR AT LEAST ESTABLISH
A GAME PLAN?

23:48.083 --> 23:50.792
I'M SORRY
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

23:50.792 --> 23:52.917
I...

23:52.917 --> 23:54.250
WANT TO BE
THE KIND OF MAN

23:54.250 --> 23:58.375
THAT YOU CAN RESPECT,

23:58.375 --> 23:59.417
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

23:59.417 --> 24:00.750
I MEAN...

24:00.750 --> 24:02.834
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING OUT
THERE, MUSTN'T THERE?

24:02.834 --> 24:04.083
SOMETHING FOR ME.

24:04.083 --> 24:06.083
SOMETHING THAT I CAN

24:06.083 --> 24:09.208
PUT MY HEART
AND MY PASSION BEHIND.

24:11.291 --> 24:14.917
NOW, I CAN'T STOP
LOOKING FOR THAT...

24:14.917 --> 24:17.333
UNTIL I FIND IT.

24:21.125 --> 24:25.166
GOOD GAME, PETE.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.333
WHERE'D EVERYBODY GO?

24:26.333 --> 24:27.917
THEY ALL WENT BACK TO THE BOAT.

24:27.917 --> 24:30.500
COME ON, PACE. YOU AND ME.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.000
A GOOD OL' FATHER
AND SON ONE-ON-ONE.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.125
YOU'RE DRUNK, DAD.

24:37.667 --> 24:40.375
LOOK, PACE...

24:40.375 --> 24:42.375
I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M BEING HARD ON YOU,

24:42.375 --> 24:44.500
BUT IT'S MY JOB
TO PROTECT YOU.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.041
COME ON. SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

24:47.041 --> 24:48.625
LET'S GO.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.291
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO.

24:50.291 --> 24:53.625
THIS IS YOUTH
AGAINST THE MASTER, HUH?

24:53.625 --> 24:54.625
YOU READY?

24:54.625 --> 24:56.083
MASTER, HUH?

24:56.083 --> 24:57.792
WATCH THIS.

24:57.792 --> 25:00.041
YEAH, WATCH THIS HERE.

25:00.041 --> 25:00.583
READY?

25:00.583 --> 25:02.959
NOW, THERE.

25:02.959 --> 25:03.959
THAT'S JUST

25:03.959 --> 25:04.500
TO WARM YOU
UP A LITTLE BIT.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.166
WARM ME UP, HUH?

25:06.166 --> 25:07.166
WATCH THIS, GUYS. WATCH.

25:07.166 --> 25:09.166
SHAKE OUT THAT ARM,
YOU KNOW?

25:09.166 --> 25:10.708
COME ON.

25:13.083 --> 25:15.667
SORRY, YOU KNOW?

25:15.667 --> 25:16.375
DON'T TRY OR NOTHING THERE,
PACE.

25:16.375 --> 25:20.291
YOU GOT TO...
COME ON.

25:20.291 --> 25:22.000
WATCH HOW IT'S DONE.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.083
BEAT THAT.

25:31.542 --> 25:33.625
MUST BE TOUGH LOSING
TO YOUR SECOND BORN, HUH?

25:33.625 --> 25:34.250
ALL RIGHT, WATCH THIS.
WATCH THIS.

25:34.250 --> 25:37.250
IT'S DONE VERY SIMPLY.

25:37.250 --> 25:39.000
YES!

25:39.000 --> 25:42.667
BEAT THAT!

25:42.667 --> 25:44.750
BEAT THAT.

26:02.708 --> 26:05.542
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH LOSING, PACE,

26:05.542 --> 26:07.792
AS LONG AS YOU
DO IT GRACEFULLY.

26:07.792 --> 26:10.208
GREGORY, GIVE ME
A DRINK! I WON.

26:10.208 --> 26:11.875
[JOHN LAUGHS]

26:11.875 --> 26:15.875
THANK YOU, ROBERT,
THANK YOU, THANKS.

26:33.708 --> 26:36.250
I THINK THAT ABBY WAS RIGHT.

26:36.250 --> 26:38.291
I MEAN, ABOUT THE FACT THAT...

26:38.291 --> 26:39.667
THAT THE REASON

26:39.667 --> 26:40.250
THAT TEENAGE GIRLS
ARE SUCH CONSUMERS

26:40.250 --> 26:42.875
IS THE FACT...

26:42.875 --> 26:44.917
I MEAN, IT STEMS
FROM INSECURITY.

26:44.917 --> 26:50.000
I, UH, HAVE THIS NEED
TO LOOK AND BE PERFECT.

26:51.792 --> 26:54.250
MY HOME LIFE
IS IN TOTAL CHAOS,

26:54.250 --> 26:56.000
AND I FEEL LIKE
IF I GET STRAIGHT AS,

26:56.000 --> 26:57.917
OR IF I'M INVOLVED
IN EVERY ACTIVITY, THEN...

26:57.917 --> 27:02.792
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WON'T KNOW
THAT I'M THIS FRAUD

27:02.792 --> 27:07.000
AND THAT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING

27:07.000 --> 27:08.125
AND WHERE I'M GOING.

27:08.125 --> 27:09.875
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE
FROM NEW YORK,

27:09.875 --> 27:11.667
I FELT RELIEF.

27:11.667 --> 27:14.708
TRYING TO COMPETE IN THAT...

27:14.708 --> 27:16.625
HYPER ACCELERATED WORLD...

27:16.625 --> 27:17.458
I MEAN, I WAS IN THE FAST LANE,

27:17.458 --> 27:19.625
TO SELF-ANNIHILATION.

27:19.625 --> 27:21.125
AND THEN WHEN
I GOT HERE,

27:21.125 --> 27:23.166
I FIGURED

27:23.166 --> 27:24.834
THAT MAYBE I DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO PROVE

27:24.834 --> 27:26.291
AND THAT I COULD
FINALLY SLOW DOWN,

27:26.291 --> 27:29.333
BUT HAVING ALL THAT EXPERIENCE
JUST CAME BACK TO HAUNT ME.

27:29.333 --> 27:31.625
I MEAN, IN NEW YORK,
I WAS THE...

27:31.625 --> 27:33.875
PRECOCIOUS INGENUE,

27:33.875 --> 27:36.542
AND IN CAPESIDE,

27:36.542 --> 27:41.333
ALL I'LL EVER BE KNOWN AS
IS THE NEW YORK WILD CHILD

27:41.333 --> 27:42.959
AND THE TOWN SLUT
AND THE BAD GIRL.

27:42.959 --> 27:45.834
SO WHEN SOMEBODY COMES ALONG
WHO HAS...

27:45.834 --> 27:47.208
HAS SEEN THINGS
THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN

27:47.208 --> 27:52.166
OR EXPERIENCED THINGS
THAT I'VE ONLY DREAMED ABOUT,

27:52.166 --> 27:54.125
MY DEFENSES GO UP BECAUSE...

27:54.125 --> 27:57.333
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.458
UH, I JUST...

27:59.458 --> 28:00.500
I THINK I'M JUST
JOEY POTTER.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.500
YOU KNOW,

28:01.500 --> 28:02.917
THE SMALL-TOWN GIRL

28:02.917 --> 28:04.667
WHO WILL LIVE AND DIE
IN THE CREEK,

28:04.667 --> 28:06.041
AND, YOU KNOW,

28:06.041 --> 28:10.458
AS MUCH AS I COMPLETELY
DISDAIN THAT IDENTITY,

28:10.458 --> 28:14.166
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL I'VE GOT
AND...

28:14.166 --> 28:15.166
AND I DON'T KNOW,

28:15.166 --> 28:18.625
SO IF I EVER FEEL
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

28:18.625 --> 28:19.667
SOMEBODY IS
GOING TO STEAL

28:19.667 --> 28:21.417
THAT MEASLY BIT
OF SELF THAT I HAVE

28:21.417 --> 28:21.875
OR...

28:25.083 --> 28:27.917
YOU KNOW, THAT...
THAT SMALL AMOUNT OF LOVE

28:27.917 --> 28:32.875
THAT I'VE SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO ACCUMULATE, I...

28:32.875 --> 28:35.125
I FEEL THREATENED AND...

28:35.125 --> 28:37.208
AND I GO FOR THE JUGULAR.
I ADMIT IT.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.917
I ADMIT IT.

28:48.375 --> 28:49.375
HEY, DAWSON?

28:49.375 --> 28:51.375
JACK...

28:51.375 --> 28:53.542
WHATEVER IT IS, I'M TIRED.

28:53.542 --> 28:54.667
I'VE HAD ENOUGH DRAMA
FOR ONE DAY.

28:54.667 --> 28:56.708
NO, I THINK
I'M GOING TO BE NAUSEOUS.

28:56.708 --> 28:57.959
YOU'RE SICK?

28:57.959 --> 28:59.583
YEAH.

28:59.583 --> 29:00.834
YEAH, IT'S...

29:00.834 --> 29:03.208
THE BOAT'S JUST
STILL ROCKING.

29:03.208 --> 29:06.291
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO PLAY IT COOL, BUT...

29:06.291 --> 29:08.208
EVER SINCE I SET FOOT
ON THIS BOAT,

29:08.208 --> 29:09.834
I'VE JUST WANTED TO BARF.

29:09.834 --> 29:11.708
I KNOW THE FEELING.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.667
THIS WASN'T EXACTLY
HOW I ENVISIONED

29:13.667 --> 29:15.959
THIS WHOLE FATHER-SON OUTING.

29:15.959 --> 29:17.125
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

29:17.125 --> 29:18.417
I HAVEN'T HAD
A FATHER-SON WEEKEND

29:18.417 --> 29:19.667
IN A LONG TIME.

29:19.667 --> 29:21.750
WHERE IS YOUR DAD, JACK?

29:21.750 --> 29:23.458
I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE HE'S NOT.

29:23.458 --> 29:25.375
HE'S NOT HERE.

29:25.375 --> 29:27.000
OF COURSE IF YOU ASK
MY MOTHER OR MY SISTER,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.792
THEY'LL TELL YOU
HE'S UP IN PROVIDENCE,

29:30.792 --> 29:32.500
TAKING CARE OF THE BUSINESS.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.917
THE TRUTH IS,

29:33.917 --> 29:34.625
HE'S UP IN PROVIDENCE
BECAUSE HE LEFT US.

29:34.625 --> 29:37.917
I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS.

29:37.917 --> 29:40.917
DAWSON, YOUR FATHER
MOVED UP THE STREET.

29:40.917 --> 29:43.625
MY FATHER'S GONE.

29:43.625 --> 29:46.333
TRY AND PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE,
HUH?

29:56.500 --> 30:00.166
WHOA! WE'VE RUN AGROUND.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.375
[LAUGHS]

30:05.458 --> 30:08.667
I GUESS THIS IS AS
GOOD A TIME AS ANY

30:08.667 --> 30:09.667
TO HAVE THAT
FATHER-SON TALK.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.834
[IMITATING FATHER]
SO...

30:11.834 --> 30:14.792
HOW YOU DOING IN SCHOOL, PACEY?

30:14.792 --> 30:16.291
[AS HIMSELF] WELL...

30:16.291 --> 30:18.875
ACTUALLY, DAD,
I'M DOING ALL RIGHT.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.667
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY
TURNING THINGS AROUND.

30:20.667 --> 30:23.125
IT TURNS OUT I'M PRETTY SMART.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.250
MAYBE I'M COLLEGE-BOUND.

30:24.250 --> 30:27.125
[IMITATING FATHER]
GOOD MAN, PACEY. I ALWAYS KNEW

30:27.125 --> 30:27.959
YOU'D TURN OUT
TO BE SOMETHING.

30:27.959 --> 30:31.375
HOW ARE THE LADIES TREATING YOU?

30:31.375 --> 30:34.500
[AS HIMSELF]
WELL, I MET THIS WOMAN.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.125
[IMITATING FATHER] IS SHE CUTE?

30:37.125 --> 30:40.500
[AS HIMSELF] CUTE? MAN...

30:40.500 --> 30:43.000
OH, ANDIE'S BEAUTIFUL.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.750
SHE'S SMART, SHE'S FUNNY...

30:49.458 --> 30:52.000
I TELL YOU, THIS GIRL IS
REALLY SOMETHING SPECIAL, DAD...

30:52.000 --> 30:54.708
AND FOR WHATEVER REASON,

30:54.708 --> 30:57.792
SHE SEEMS TO THINK
I'M PRETTY SPECIAL TOO.

30:57.792 --> 31:01.667
SO WHY CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

31:01.667 --> 31:04.208
HMM? WHY CAN'T YOU SEE ME, MAN?

31:04.208 --> 31:06.875
WHEN DID YOU GIVE UP ON ME?
WHEN I WAS 5?

31:06.875 --> 31:08.875
HMM? 10, 12?

31:08.875 --> 31:12.208
I'M 16 YEARS OLD, DAD,

31:12.208 --> 31:14.834
AND I'M HERE,
AND I'M NOT PERFECT, MAN,

31:14.834 --> 31:18.250
BUT I TRY SO HARD FOR YOU.

31:18.250 --> 31:20.041
I JUST...

31:22.625 --> 31:26.291
IT'S YOUR JOB.
