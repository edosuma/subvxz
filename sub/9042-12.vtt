WEBVTT

00:14.900 --> 00:16.200
- HEY. READY?
- YEAH.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.533
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
LET'S GO.

00:17.533 --> 00:18.533
HEY. HI, AMY.

00:18.533 --> 00:20.433
- HEY, RAY.
HEY, BE CAREFUL.

00:20.433 --> 00:23.567
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOOD NOW.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.900
- DEB ISN'T HOME, IS SHE?

00:34.900 --> 00:36.433
- NO.

00:36.433 --> 00:38.100
- WELL, TELL HER I SAID HI.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.433
HAVE A GOOD TIME TODAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:40.433 --> 00:43.400
THANKS FOR BRINGING ME BY.
SEE YA.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.733
- HOW 'BOUT A KISS?
- OH.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.467
DID YOU SEE HOW I PLAYED IT
THERE WITH AMY, NICE AND COOL?

01:00.467 --> 01:04.300
SHE DOESN'T SUSPECT A THING.

01:04.300 --> 01:07.767
- LIKE WHAT,
THAT YOU'RE A DWARF ON STILTS?

01:12.567 --> 01:15.767
- WHAT THE LOVELY AMY
DOES NOT SUSPECT

01:15.767 --> 01:17.900
IS THAT HER BOYFRIEND, ROBERT,

01:17.900 --> 01:21.767
IS ABOUT TO PROPOSE TO HER!

01:25.767 --> 01:27.200
- WHAT?

01:27.200 --> 01:28.900
- YEAH, YEAH, I'M GONNA ASK HER
TO MARRY ME.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.433
- YEAH?

01:30.433 --> 01:31.800
- ALL RIGHT,
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.267
"ARE YOU SURE, ROBERT?

01:33.267 --> 01:34.967
"YOU DON'T HAVE EXACTLY
THE BEST TRACK RECORD.

01:34.967 --> 01:36.867
"PEOPLE WHO DO NOT
REMEMBER HISTORY

01:36.867 --> 01:38.167
ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT."

01:38.167 --> 01:40.467
- NO, NO.
I WAS GONNA SAY CONGRATULATIONS.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.267
- WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
BE HAPPY FOR ME?

01:43.267 --> 01:45.333
- I AM.
I'M HAPPY, ROBERT.

01:45.333 --> 01:48.467
I REALLY AM.
IT'S--IT'S GREAT.

01:53.933 --> 01:57.033
HA HA!
OH, MAN!

01:57.033 --> 01:58.367
WOW.
WAIT'LL DEBRA HEARS ABOUT THIS.

01:58.367 --> 01:59.567
- NO!

02:01.567 --> 02:04.000
- WHAT?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.333
- YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYBODY.

02:06.333 --> 02:09.300
I DON'T WANT AMY TO GET ANY WIND
OF THIS UNTIL I'M READY.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.633
- ALL RIGHT,
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY!

02:11.633 --> 02:13.033
GOD.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.867
COME ON.
ARE WE HITTING A BUCKET OR WHAT?

02:14.867 --> 02:16.400
- OH, NO DRIVING RANGE TODAY.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.733
THIS WAS ALL JUST
TO THROW HER OFF.

02:17.733 --> 02:19.900
I GOT A LOT OF THINGS
I GOT TO DO.

02:19.900 --> 02:22.733
SEE YOU LATER.

02:22.733 --> 02:26.200
- WELL, WHAT DO I DO NOW?
I'M ALL HORNY FOR GOLF!

02:34.033 --> 02:38.367
- LOOK, HONEY, I FOUND
ANOTHER PIECE OF JESUS' BEARD.

02:40.100 --> 02:43.467
- OH, GOOD.
PUT THAT IN THE PILE.

02:43.467 --> 02:46.600
I'M STILL WORKING
ON THE SANDALS.

02:48.467 --> 02:49.733
[doorbell rings]

02:49.733 --> 02:51.200
- I'LL GET IT.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.667
- I WONDER WHO THAT COULD BE
AT THIS HOUR.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.167
- HELLO, MR. MACDOUGALL.

03:02.167 --> 03:04.000
- ROBERT?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.200
MAY I?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.933
- UH...SURE.

03:10.933 --> 03:12.567
AMY'S NOT HERE, YOU KNOW.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.133
- OH, NO,
I'M HERE TO SEE YOU.

03:15.133 --> 03:16.533
MRS. MACDOUGALL.

03:16.533 --> 03:19.767
SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR EVENING.

03:19.767 --> 03:23.100
- HELLO, ROBERT.
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.567
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO PENNSYLVANIA?

03:25.567 --> 03:28.500
- MY CAR.

03:30.033 --> 03:32.700
[both chuckle]

03:37.867 --> 03:40.300
- WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME WARM CIDER?

03:40.300 --> 03:41.767
- OH, NO,
NO, THANK YOU.

03:41.767 --> 03:45.700
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP
TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME.

03:48.833 --> 03:51.800
ANYWAY...UM...

03:51.800 --> 03:54.733
THE REASON THAT I'M HERE...

03:58.833 --> 04:01.767
[breathing deeply]

04:09.600 --> 04:12.267
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT AMY,

04:12.267 --> 04:15.100
AND SHE MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.

04:15.100 --> 04:19.333
IN FACT, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

04:19.333 --> 04:21.367
I WANT TO DO THINGS RIGHT.

04:21.367 --> 04:24.333
AND OUT OF RESPECT FOR HER

04:24.333 --> 04:25.633
AND YOU,

04:25.633 --> 04:30.767
I WOULD LIKE
TO FORMALLY REQUEST

04:30.767 --> 04:36.033
YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAND
IN MARRIAGE.

04:40.533 --> 04:42.033
- NO.

04:55.067 --> 04:56.600
- WHAT?

04:56.600 --> 05:00.433
- NO.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.633
- NO?

05:04.200 --> 05:08.033
- WE DON'T THINK
IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.533
- IT'S NICE TO
SEE YOU AGAIN, THOUGH.

05:17.467 --> 05:19.733
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A LONG DRIVE BACK.

05:19.733 --> 05:22.100
I'LL PUT SOME CIDER
IN A CUP FOR YOU.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.500
- [stammering]

05:23.500 --> 05:27.733
PLEASE.
MAY I ASK--I--WHY?

05:27.733 --> 05:29.267
- WHY?

05:32.633 --> 05:35.867
HE WANTS TO KNOW WHY.

05:35.867 --> 05:37.367
- OH, PETER.

05:37.367 --> 05:39.567
ROBERT, HAVE YOU MET
AMY'S BROTHER PETER?

05:39.567 --> 05:42.467
- NO.
WE'VE NEVER HAD THE PLEASURE.

05:44.167 --> 05:46.133
I MET HIS BROTHER
RAYMOND ONCE.

05:46.133 --> 05:49.233
HE CAME
INTO MY COMIC BOOK STORE.

05:49.233 --> 05:52.400
I LIKED HIM.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.167
- OH, IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, PETER.

05:54.167 --> 05:56.500
I'VE HEARD A LOT
OF GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOU.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.233
- IS THAT A NEW SHIRT?

06:01.233 --> 06:04.367
- YES, IT IS, MAMA.
DO YOU LIKE IT?

06:11.200 --> 06:13.800
- VERY MUCH.
YOU LOOK HANDSOME.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.200
- THANK YOU, MAMA.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.533
- [clears throat]
I'M SORRY.

06:16.533 --> 06:20.467
BUT YOU KNOW...
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.967
- WELL, ROBERT,
YOU JUST DON'T SEEM TO HAVE

06:23.967 --> 06:26.800
THE STABILITY WE'D PREFER

06:26.800 --> 06:29.833
IN A HUSBAND FOR OUR AMY.

06:29.833 --> 06:32.200
- WELL, LOOK, YOU KNOW, WE'VE
HAD OUR UPS AND DOWNS, BUT--

06:32.200 --> 06:35.333
- IT'S JUST THAT
OVER THE YEARS, ROBERT,

06:35.333 --> 06:39.433
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY TIMES
WHEN AMY WAS VERY UNHAPPY.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.967
- YOU DON'T KNOW
THE HALF OF IT, MAMA.

06:41.967 --> 06:43.767
SO OFTEN SHE WOULD COME
INTO THE STORE

06:43.767 --> 06:45.733
AND CURL UP
IN THE USED COMIC SECTION

06:45.733 --> 06:49.200
AND CRY LIKE LITTLE LOTTA.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.167
- OH, MY.

06:51.167 --> 06:53.467
SO YOU COULD SEE, ROBERT,

06:53.467 --> 06:56.267
I THINK ANY PARENT
WOULD NOT WANT THEIR DAUGHTER

06:56.267 --> 06:58.967
TO HAVE A LIFE OF...

06:58.967 --> 07:01.200
YOU.

07:07.233 --> 07:09.833
- BUT I'M--I'M DIFFERENT NOW.
I--I FEEL--

07:09.833 --> 07:12.267
- ROBERT, I'M THE KIND OF FELLOW
WHO LOVES A GOOD DISCUSSION.

07:12.267 --> 07:15.567
ASK ANYBODY.
I'M THAT KIND OF GUY.

07:15.567 --> 07:19.933
BUT THIS IS NOT OPEN
FOR DISCUSSION.

07:19.933 --> 07:22.367
OKAY?

07:23.767 --> 07:25.067
- I'LL SHOW HIM THE DOOR.

07:25.067 --> 07:27.067
- WAIT--WAIT.
JUST--UH!

07:29.533 --> 07:32.300
LET ME--OKAY,
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

07:32.300 --> 07:34.733
I CAN'T MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER?

07:34.733 --> 07:37.300
- THAT'S CORRECT.

07:37.300 --> 07:40.667
BUT THANKS FOR ASKING.

07:47.933 --> 07:49.200
- HEY.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.600
- HI, ROBERT.
- HEY.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.733
- ROBBIE, YOU'RE OUT
LATE TONIGHT.

07:53.733 --> 07:54.967
WHERE WERE YOU?

07:54.967 --> 07:56.500
- UH, NOWHERE, MA.
I WAS JUST OUT.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.633
RAYMOND, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
COULD I--

08:00.767 --> 08:02.300
- WHAT?

08:02.300 --> 08:07.133
- SOMETHING IS WRONG.

08:07.133 --> 08:10.733
WHAT IS IT?

08:10.733 --> 08:13.233
IS IT SOMETHING WITH AMY?

08:14.633 --> 08:16.167
I KNEW IT!

08:16.167 --> 08:17.433
THAT'S THE LOOK YOU HAVE

08:17.433 --> 08:19.067
EVERY TIME
YOU BREAK UP WITH HER.

08:19.067 --> 08:21.733
- OH, ROBERT, NOT AGAIN!

08:21.733 --> 08:23.133
- YOU BROKE UP WITH AMY.

08:23.133 --> 08:26.167
DO YOU KNOW THAT
YOU'RE KILLING ME, ROBBIE?

08:26.167 --> 08:29.033
DO YOU EVEN CARE
THAT YOU'RE KILLING ME?

08:29.033 --> 08:32.100
- MA!
- DIG A GRAVE AND THROW ME IN.

08:34.267 --> 08:37.400
- I'VE GOT A SHOVEL.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.500
- WHY DID YOU BREAK UP WITH AMY?

08:40.500 --> 08:42.233
- MA, I DIDN'T BREAK UP
WITH AMY!

08:42.233 --> 08:44.733
I WANT TO ASK HER TO MARRY ME!

08:44.733 --> 08:46.867
- MARRY YOU?

08:46.867 --> 08:49.600
- REALLY?

08:49.600 --> 08:53.667
- YES.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.600
[both scream-laughing]

09:01.433 --> 09:04.933
- I'M SO HAPPY!
SO HAPPY!

09:04.933 --> 09:08.067
- YEAH, SON.
HOLY CRAP!

09:11.200 --> 09:13.567
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA MARRY AMY.

09:13.567 --> 09:16.533
- LISTEN, MA.
I SAID I WANT TO MARRY AMY.

09:16.533 --> 09:18.800
BUT I WENT TO
ASK HER PARENTS FIRST,

09:18.800 --> 09:20.367
AND THAT'S WHERE I WAS TONIGHT.

09:20.367 --> 09:22.133
- OH, HOW ARE HER PARENTS?

09:22.133 --> 09:24.033
I'M SURE THEY'RE VERY NICE.

09:24.033 --> 09:25.067
- THEY ARE VERY NICE,

09:25.067 --> 09:27.300
AND THEY VERY NICELY SAID NO.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.667
- WHAT?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "NO"?

09:29.667 --> 09:32.267
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW COULD THEY SAY THAT?

09:32.267 --> 09:34.500
- I COULD SEE THAT.

09:34.500 --> 09:39.000
- STOP IT, FRANK.
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

09:39.000 --> 09:40.733
- WHY'D YOU GO TO HER PARENTS?

09:40.733 --> 09:43.433
- IT WAS JUST A FORMALITY.
I NEVER THOUGHT THEY'D SAY NO.

09:43.433 --> 09:45.967
AND HER BROTHER PETER,
HE HATES ME.

09:45.967 --> 09:50.867
- OH, I MET THAT GUY ONCE.
HE'S LIKE A PSYCHO NUT JOB.

09:50.867 --> 09:52.133
- YEAH?
HE'S FOND OF YOU.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.700
- YEAH? WHAT'D HE SAY?

09:54.700 --> 09:57.833
- WHO CARES ABOUT HER FAMILY?
- EXCUSE ME.

09:57.833 --> 10:01.700
WHEN YOU MARRY A PERSON,
YOU ALSO MARRY THE FAMILY.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.333
- I'VE HEARD.

10:15.033 --> 10:17.033
OKAY, YOU LISTEN TO ME, ROBERT.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.400
THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND AMY.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.500
HER PARENTS ARE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO GET USED TO THE IDEA.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.867
BUT IT'S YOUR LIFE.
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

10:24.867 --> 10:25.967
- UNTIL YOU GET MARRIED.

10:25.967 --> 10:28.300
THEN YOU DO WHAT
SHE WANTS TO DO.

10:37.667 --> 10:40.000
- AND HOW ABOUT
THAT CHOCOLATE CAKE?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.367
- FANTASTIC.

10:41.367 --> 10:43.100
IT ALWAYS TASTES BETTER
WITHOUT THE FAMILY.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.500
[both laugh]

10:44.500 --> 10:47.433
[siren blaring]

10:52.667 --> 10:54.667
- WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS AMY MACDOUGALL?

10:54.667 --> 10:58.433
- SHE--SHE IS.
- PLEASE STEP BACK, MA'AM.

10:58.433 --> 11:01.400
- AMY MACDOUGALL, YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SINGLE.

11:03.100 --> 11:06.933
ANYTHING YOU SAY MAY BE USED
AGAINST YOU IN A CHURCH OF GOD.

11:06.933 --> 11:10.400
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A HUSBAND,
ONE MAY BE PROVIDED FOR YOU.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.100
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THESE RIGHTS
AS I HAVE READ THEM TO YOU?

11:13.100 --> 11:16.000
- HUH?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.700
- SHE DOESN'T GET IT.

11:17.700 --> 11:21.033
- ALL RIGHT.
WHO'S GONNA CUFF HER?

11:30.567 --> 11:32.033
- HI, AMY.

11:37.467 --> 11:40.967
I LOVE YOU, AMY.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.300
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

11:44.833 --> 11:47.533
- HUH?

11:47.533 --> 11:50.933
- I LOVE YOU.
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

11:50.933 --> 11:53.100
- BUT, ROBERT,

11:53.100 --> 11:56.167
WE--WE NEVER
EVEN TALKED ABOUT--

11:56.167 --> 12:00.800
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

12:00.800 --> 12:03.733
- I'M READY TO BE HAPPY.

12:06.167 --> 12:11.467
- I AM TOO.

12:11.467 --> 12:13.800
- IS THAT A YES?

12:13.800 --> 12:15.000
- HUH?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.400
OH, HI.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.800
YES!

12:18.800 --> 12:20.467
YES!
- YES!

12:20.467 --> 12:21.600
- YES!

12:21.600 --> 12:23.867
- YES! YES!

12:23.867 --> 12:27.000
[all laughing]

12:35.333 --> 12:38.267
- WHOO!

12:42.033 --> 12:44.333
- OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

12:44.333 --> 12:46.767
- DON'T YOU WANT
TO PUT THIS ON?

12:46.767 --> 12:50.133
- OH.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

12:50.133 --> 12:53.167
I JUST LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

12:53.167 --> 12:54.900
I'M GETTING MARRIED!

12:54.900 --> 12:55.933
[squeals]

12:55.933 --> 12:57.700
TO YOU!

12:57.700 --> 12:59.867
"ROBERT AND I
ARE GETTING MARRIED."

12:59.867 --> 13:03.033
THERE'S GOING TO BE A MARRIAGE,
AND I WILL BE THE WIFE.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.633
A BRIDE! WITH A DRESS!

13:05.633 --> 13:08.900
THANKS FOR MARRYING ME!

13:08.900 --> 13:11.033
- MY PLEASURE.

13:11.033 --> 13:12.467
- CAN YOU DO
ONE THING FOR ME?

13:12.467 --> 13:14.400
- FOR YOU,
I'LL DO TWO THINGS.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.200
- I KNOW IT SOUNDS QUEER,
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.567
CAN YOU ASK MY FATHER
FOR MY HAND?

13:19.567 --> 13:22.700
IT WOULD MEAN
SO MUCH TO THEM.

13:33.267 --> 13:35.133
- NO PROBLEM.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.567
- WELL, THERE WE ARE.

13:44.567 --> 13:49.133
IS THAT NOT OUR LORD
IN ALL HIS GLORY, OR WHAT?

13:49.133 --> 13:53.000
- IT IS A GLORIOUS PUZZLE.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.767
[doorbell rings]

13:54.767 --> 13:55.833
I'LL GET IT, HONEY.

13:55.833 --> 13:57.367
- NOW, WHO COULD THAT BE?

14:00.067 --> 14:02.367
- OH, MY...

14:04.900 --> 14:06.533
HELLO.

14:06.533 --> 14:10.733

14:15.733 --> 14:17.267

14:17.267 --> 14:18.933
I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO MEET SOMEONE

14:18.933 --> 14:20.933
WHO I BELIEVE
WILL MAKE YOU FEEL

14:20.933 --> 14:23.167
A HECK OF A LOT BETTER
ABOUT ME,

14:23.167 --> 14:26.067
BECAUSE YOU WILL SEE
THE TYPE OF PERSON

14:26.067 --> 14:29.100
WITH WHOM I ASSOCIATE WITH.

14:30.533 --> 14:34.100
THIS IS
AN AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST,

A WHOLESOME FAMILY MAN,

14:35.733 --> 14:37.867
AND ONE OF LYNBROOK,

14:56.233 --> 14:57.633
PLEASE COME IN.

14:57.633 --> 15:00.733

15:00.733 --> 15:02.133
IT'S A LOVELY HOME,

15:02.133 --> 15:03.533

15:06.067 --> 15:08.500

15:08.500 --> 15:09.400

15:09.400 --> 15:11.000
RAY BARONE, SPORTSWRITER,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.600
"NEWSDAY" NEWSPAPER,
PRIZEWINNER.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.767
WON A PRIZE.

15:17.400 --> 15:21.267
- I'LL GET THE CIDER.

15:21.267 --> 15:25.233
- LISTEN, UH,

15:25.233 --> 15:26.633
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU FELLAS

15:26.633 --> 15:28.733
COMING ALL THE WAY
BACK HERE, BUT--

15:28.733 --> 15:30.700
- GO AHEAD, RAYMOND.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.533
- YOU KNOW,
I DID WANT TO MEET YOU TWO.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.267
OH, THANK YOU THERE.
THANK YOU.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.200
UM...I--PLEASE, COULD WE SIT?

15:37.200 --> 15:40.367
LET'S JUST SIT
FOR A SECOND, OKAY?

15:47.333 --> 15:50.767
GOOD. GOOD.
THIS IS NICE.

15:50.767 --> 15:52.000
- YES.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.367
- HEY, ISN'T HE THE GUY

15:53.367 --> 15:56.567
WHO SELLS TIE-DYED SHIRTS
AT THE BEACH?

16:04.667 --> 16:06.200
THAT WAS JUST A JOKE.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.333
THAT'S--I--

16:09.333 --> 16:11.300
HE'S GREAT.
I HAVE HIS BOOK.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.433
ANYWAY--

16:19.433 --> 16:21.767
- RAYMOND IS MARRIED.
HE HAS CHILDREN.

16:21.767 --> 16:23.733
- YES, I DO, ROBERT.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.333
- GOOD, GOOD FAMILY.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.900
GOD-FEARING, RIGHT?

16:27.900 --> 16:29.900
CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.033
ALL OF US,
GOD-FEARING PEOPLE.

16:32.033 --> 16:35.367
WE'RE SCARED TO DEATH.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.133
- HELLO AGAIN.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.200
RAYMOND!
HOW WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU!

16:49.233 --> 16:51.900
HE'S THE GOOD ONE, MAMA.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.367
- THANKS THERE, PETER,
BUT ROBERT'S GOOD TOO.

16:54.367 --> 16:56.667
HE'S A GOOD PERSON.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.367
LIEUTENANT IN
THE NEW YORK POLICE FORCE.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.200
HE'S LIKE A HERO.

17:00.200 --> 17:04.833
HE'S ALSO THE KINDEST
AND SWEETEST GUY I KNOW.

17:04.833 --> 17:08.500
AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HE LOVES AMY VERY MUCH,

17:08.500 --> 17:14.333
AND I KNOW THAT HE WOULD DEVOTE
HIS WHOLE LIFE TO HER.

17:14.333 --> 17:17.233
- OH, I THINK MISS PUSS
HAS A KISS FOR YOU, RAYMOND.

17:20.367 --> 17:22.533
- HEY.

17:22.533 --> 17:25.367
HI, THERE.

17:25.367 --> 17:27.267
MRS. PUSS.
THAT'S VERY NICE.

17:27.267 --> 17:29.167
I WAS JUST, UH,
TELLING THEM ABOUT--

17:29.167 --> 17:30.433
- ABOUT YOUR BROTHER?

17:30.433 --> 17:32.467
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.
OKAY, FINE.

17:32.467 --> 17:35.900
THEN WHY DON'T WE REALLY TELL
ABOUT HIM THEN, SHALL WE?

17:35.900 --> 17:37.800
- PETER, DON'T GET EXCITED.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.267
- NO, MAMA, I'M SORRY.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.100
I HAVE TRIED TO KEEP
CERTAIN DETAILS FROM YOU,

17:41.100 --> 17:43.000
BUT NOW YOU HAVE TO KNOW.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.267
ISN'T IT TRUE,
LIEUTENANT BARONE,

17:46.267 --> 17:48.500
THAT WHILE YOU
WERE SEEING AMY,

17:48.500 --> 17:51.833
YOU WERE ALSO SEEING
TWO OTHER WOMEN?

17:51.833 --> 17:53.267
- WHAT?

17:53.267 --> 17:55.767
- NO, NO, THAT WAS JUST,
LIKE, FOR A MINUTE.

17:55.767 --> 17:58.800
YOU SEE, THE FIRST GIRL I MET
WAS WHEN I WENT TO ITALY,

17:58.800 --> 18:02.233
AND IT WAS REALLY JUST
AN INTERNATIONAL MIX-UP.

18:02.233 --> 18:06.200
AND--AND THEN THE OTHER GIRL
WAS MY EX-WIFE, WHICH--

18:06.200 --> 18:07.467
- EX-WIFE?

18:07.467 --> 18:09.567
- OH, MY.
YOU'RE DIVORCED?

18:09.567 --> 18:11.200
- SHE WAS A STRIPPER,
WASN'T SHE?

18:11.200 --> 18:12.400
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.100
SHE WAS A DANCER
OF THE EXOTIC TRADITION.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.500
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:17.500 --> 18:19.067
WHY DON'T WE JUST
CUT TO THE CHASE HERE

18:19.067 --> 18:20.833
SO YOU CAN BE
ON YOUR WAY, OKAY?

18:20.833 --> 18:23.600
ROBERT TOOK AMY'S VIRGINITY.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.333
- OH...

18:26.333 --> 18:27.967
- WHAT?

18:27.967 --> 18:29.833
WHAT?

18:29.833 --> 18:31.567
- [whimpering]

18:39.367 --> 18:42.400
- LISTEN, REALLY,
THAT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.233
- HER VIRGINITY, MAMA.

18:44.233 --> 18:45.867
HER VIRGINITY!

18:45.867 --> 18:49.033
- STOP SAYING IT!

18:49.033 --> 18:53.833
- THIS IS A TERRIBLE EVENING.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.267
- I DON'T FEEL WELL.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.800
- W-W-WAIT, PLEASE,
IF YOU WOULD.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.100
- LISTEN, ROBERT'S REALLY
NOT THAT KIND OF GUY.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.433
I MEAN, IF ANYTHING,

19:00.433 --> 19:02.333
I REMEMBER HE WAS AFRAID
TO TOUCH YOUR DAUGHTER.

19:02.333 --> 19:03.733
SHE WAS THE ONE
WHO WANTED IT.

19:03.733 --> 19:06.667
- OH!

19:12.800 --> 19:15.000
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.167
- I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

19:17.167 --> 19:18.467
I'M IN PENNSYLVANIA!

19:18.467 --> 19:20.500
- I'M GONNA GET MOTHER UPSTAIRS.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.233
PERHAPS YOU BOYS SHOULD GO NOW.

19:22.233 --> 19:24.700
- I'M DIZZY.
- LEAN ON ME, PAT.

19:24.700 --> 19:28.333
WE SHOULD'VE NEVER LET
AMY GO TO THE CITY.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
- WELL...

19:31.500 --> 19:35.267
WE SHOULD DO THIS
AGAIN SOMETIME.

19:35.267 --> 19:36.667
BUT NOW,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

19:36.667 --> 19:40.000
MISS PUSS AND I HAVE
SOME COCOA ON THE STOVE.

19:47.733 --> 19:49.067
- OH.

19:49.067 --> 19:52.200
WELL.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.567
IT'S TOO LATE TO USE
THE BATHROOM, RIGHT?

19:54.567 --> 19:57.433
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

20:04.867 --> 20:06.900
- OH, HEY.
- HEY, GUYS.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.233
- OH, HI.

20:08.233 --> 20:09.733
- BETTER HEAD
FOR THE HILLS, ROBERT.

20:13.433 --> 20:15.000
- COULD WE GO TALK
FOR A COUPLE MINUTES?

20:15.467 --> 20:16.933
- OH, SURE.

20:16.933 --> 20:20.900
- OH, ROBBIE, I FOUND A PLACE
THAT CAN MAKE YOU A TUXEDO.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.600
THEY DO THE CIRCUS.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.267
- LISTEN, AMY,
I WENT TO YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE.

20:33.267 --> 20:35.700
- YOU DID?
DID YOU ASK THEM?

20:35.700 --> 20:37.600
OH, THEY MUST'VE BEEN
SO THRILLED.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.733
- YOUR MOTHER
COULDN'T STOP CRYING.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.700
LISTEN, AMY.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.500
THEY SAID NO.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.733
- WHAT?

20:49.733 --> 20:54.733
- THEY DON'T APPROVE OF ME,
OF MY PAST.

20:54.733 --> 20:57.367
THEY SAID NO TO ME.

20:57.367 --> 20:59.733
- WHAT?

20:59.733 --> 21:01.233
REALLY?

21:01.233 --> 21:02.800
- AMY, THEY LOVE YOU,

21:02.800 --> 21:06.100
AND THEY WANT WHAT'S BEST
FOR YOU, AND...

21:06.100 --> 21:09.900
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

21:09.900 --> 21:15.367
SO I'M SORRY.

21:15.367 --> 21:19.667
- WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

21:19.667 --> 21:23.567
I WANT TO GET MARRIED.

21:23.567 --> 21:27.400
AND WE CAN FIX THIS.
I KNOW WE CAN.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.400
MY PARENTS WILL LEARN
TO LOVE YOU

21:29.400 --> 21:32.567
THE WAY
YOUR PARENTS LOVE YOU.

21:43.700 --> 21:45.367
- GREAT.

21:50.867 --> 21:54.267
- I KNOW.
I'LL TALK TO MY BROTHER PETER.

21:54.267 --> 21:55.700
HE'LL HELP US.
