One more time.

01:25.219 --> 01:28.787
Thunder and lightning!
All hands on deck!

01:28.789 --> 01:32.624
It's Red Jessica's ship,
<i>The Rose!</i>

01:32.626 --> 01:37.563
That means Red Jessica
has accepted your invitation
to go on a treasure hunt.

01:37.565 --> 01:41.600
Yes, Mr. Smee.
Isn't it wonderful?

01:41.602 --> 01:45.404
She and I are going to look
for the legendary treasure

01:45.406 --> 01:50.042
of The Ruby Heart
of Hearts... together!

01:50.044 --> 01:53.579
Aye, Captain. I've heard
she's quite the pirate gal.

01:53.581 --> 01:57.616
[Red Jessica] Gangway!
[chuckles]

01:57.618 --> 01:59.718
<i>¶ Gangway </i>

02:09.730 --> 02:12.498

02:12.500 --> 02:14.766
<i>¶ She's gonna knock you</i>
<i>for a loop-the-loop ¶</i>

02:14.768 --> 02:17.736

<i>than a pair of boots ¶</i>

02:17.738 --> 02:21.640

<i>Oh, what a pirate gal ¶</i>

02:21.642 --> 02:24.309
<i>¶ She don't need no map</i>

02:24.311 --> 02:28.714
<i>¶ To find the way</i>

02:29.616 --> 02:31.850
Ahoy, Captain Hook.

02:31.852 --> 02:37.022
Red Jessica, it's so good
to set me salty eyes on ye.

02:37.024 --> 02:40.492
You brighten up me ship
like the sunrise.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.462
Ah, scuttle me boots,
look at ya!

02:43.464 --> 02:45.764
You haven't changed at all.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.666
Although the
last time I saw you,

02:47.668 --> 02:50.969
you were swimming away
from that old Tic-Tock Croc.

02:50.971 --> 02:55.474
Oh, that. I was, um...
[nervous chuckles]

02:55.476 --> 02:58.710
...just having a
bit of fun that day.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.679
Speaking of fun, Captain Hook...

03:00.681 --> 03:04.116
Please, call me James.

03:04.118 --> 03:08.987
James, I can't wait to find
the Ruby Heart of Hearts.

03:08.989 --> 03:13.058
I've heard it's the
most beautiful gem
in all of Never Land.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.528
- No pirate has ever found it.
- Until now!

03:16.530 --> 03:20.632
You see, I, the great
and glorious Captain Hook,

03:20.634 --> 03:25.270
know the way straight
to the Heart!

03:26.906 --> 03:30.008
Gee, Izzy, how many
seashells do you need?

03:30.010 --> 03:32.411
What are you gonna do
with all these shells?

03:32.413 --> 03:35.013
I can't tell you yet. [giggles]

03:35.015 --> 03:36.815
It's a surprise for later.

03:36.817 --> 03:41.186
Look alive!
Old Feather Hat, dead ahead!

03:41.188 --> 03:44.456
[Jake] And it looks like he's
got a new pirate friend!

03:46.392 --> 03:49.161
Boys, you stay here and keep
an eye on the <i>Jolly Roger</i>

03:49.163 --> 03:54.066
- while I assist the...
- No, no, Mr. Smee,
you all wait here.

03:54.068 --> 03:58.036
- I can handle this.
- Oh. Aye-aye, sir.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.771
Follow me, m'lady,

03:59.773 --> 04:03.709
and we shall soon find
the Ruby Heart of Hearts.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.611
Right glad to hear that,

04:05.613 --> 04:08.280
because I always
get my treasure.

04:08.282 --> 04:12.184
And, with your help, James,
I know we won't fail.

04:12.186 --> 04:15.787
[chuckles]
Captain Hook fail?

04:15.789 --> 04:18.690
Ha-ha! Never!

04:19.692 --> 04:21.026
Shiver me timbers!

04:21.028 --> 04:23.929
Hook is actually helping
someone besides himself!

04:23.931 --> 04:28.734
Wow! He's finally
doing the right thing.
We should help him.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.570
Say, mateys, want to go
on a treasure hunt with us,

04:31.572 --> 04:34.339
and help Captain Hook find
the Ruby Heart of Hearts?

04:35.808 --> 04:39.544
Great! Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

04:39.546 --> 04:43.081
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.718
Then we'll collect them and put
them in our Team Treasure Chest!

04:46.720 --> 04:48.654
Is everybody ready?

04:48.656 --> 04:51.223
- I got my sword!
- I got my map!

04:51.225 --> 04:53.759
And I've got my pixie dust!

04:53.761 --> 04:57.229
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.064
But only in emergencies!

04:59.066 --> 05:01.633
Yo-ho, let's go!

05:03.603 --> 05:06.571
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away </i>

05:06.573 --> 05:09.074
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

05:09.076 --> 05:10.575
<i>¶ Let's go! </i>

05:10.577 --> 05:13.745
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

05:13.747 --> 05:16.515
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land pirates ¶</i>

05:16.517 --> 05:18.684
<i>¶ And me </i>

05:20.320 --> 05:21.586
[birds chirping]

05:21.588 --> 05:24.956
[Hook] The Ruby Heart
of Hearts is this way,

05:24.958 --> 05:28.193
through Cupid's Grove.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.995
I'm impressed, James.

05:29.997 --> 05:33.365
You certainly know
exactly where you're going.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.601
[giggles] I do, don't I?

05:36.603 --> 05:38.303
Ah, coconuts!

05:38.305 --> 05:41.306
Hook is heading right
toward Stinkpot Swamp!

05:41.308 --> 05:43.175
That's the wrong path.

05:43.177 --> 05:46.545
He's got to take the path
to the Valley of the Roses.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.113
We need to get
ahead of Hook,

05:48.115 --> 05:50.282
and block the path
that goes to the swamp,

05:50.284 --> 05:54.186
so that he doesn't go
the wrong way. And I know how!

05:55.855 --> 05:58.290
Mateys, let's shake
a bunch of fruit

05:58.292 --> 06:00.692
down onto the path
to Stinkpot Swamp.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.895
Then Hook will have
to go down the other path!

06:06.733 --> 06:10.035
[Hook] Watch your step,
Red Jessica.

06:10.037 --> 06:15.640
The safe way to go
is this way, m'lady!

06:15.642 --> 06:19.678
Why, thank you, James.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.414
Yay-hey! We put Hook
on the right path

06:22.416 --> 06:26.718
through Cupid's Grove,
and we got two gold doubloons!

06:26.720 --> 06:29.421
Let's grab them
and go help Captain Hook

06:29.423 --> 06:31.056
find the Ruby Heart of Hearts.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.429
If I weren't in such a hurry
to find the treasure,

06:37.431 --> 06:40.031
I would stop and
smell the roses.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.833
Oh, so would I.

06:41.835 --> 06:46.037
The roses are ever so
lovely this time of year.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.573
- [squeaking]
- [groans]

06:48.575 --> 06:53.245
- Giant love bugs.
- Come on, James,
we can jump over them.

06:53.247 --> 06:58.583
Giant love bugs bug me.
I'm not jumping anywhere.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.752
Hook's gotta get past
those love bugs

07:00.754 --> 07:02.854
or he'll never
find the treasure.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.689
I've got an idea.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.359
Why don't we sing a song
to the love bugs

07:07.361 --> 07:10.629
and tell them to fly away.
Like this...

07:10.631 --> 07:14.466
<i>¶ Love bugs, fly away</i>
<i>Shoo, shoo ¶</i>

07:14.468 --> 07:17.803
<i>¶ Help us now</i>
<i>to clear the way</i>
<i>Shoo, shoo ¶</i>

07:17.805 --> 07:21.072
<i>[all] ¶ Love bugs, fly away</i>
<i>Shoo, shoo ¶</i>

07:21.074 --> 07:24.342
¶ Come again, some other day

07:26.479 --> 07:28.580
Well, fancy that.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.650
The love bugs
are flying away.

07:31.652 --> 07:36.054
Come, Red Jessica!
We have us a treasure to find!

07:36.056 --> 07:40.058
All right! We got
the love bugs to fly away,

07:40.060 --> 07:42.561
and we got three
more gold doubloons!

07:42.563 --> 07:46.731
Let's grab them and go follow
Captain Hook and Red Jessica!

07:49.969 --> 07:52.571
It should be right this way.

07:52.573 --> 07:57.476
A-ha! I, the great
and glorious Captain Hook,

07:57.478 --> 08:01.313
have found the
Ruby Heart of Hearts!

08:01.315 --> 08:06.518
I've got to hand it ya,
James, you found what
I've always wanted.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.788
And I shall get it for you!

08:09.790 --> 08:12.424
Let's do this
together, James.

08:12.426 --> 08:15.494
[crumbling]

08:15.496 --> 08:17.796
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

08:17.798 --> 08:19.531
Blasted bridge!

08:19.533 --> 08:23.635
Whoa! That didn't make getting
the treasure any easier.

08:23.637 --> 08:28.273
[sighs] Well, looks like our
treasure hunt ends here.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.109
Never!
I'll simply swing across!

08:31.111 --> 08:34.946
As long as there's a vine,
I'll be fine. [grunts]

08:36.048 --> 08:37.282
[grunts]

08:38.518 --> 08:41.953
[exhales]
Sunken shipwrecks!

08:41.955 --> 08:45.724
This is impossible!
James, I've tried my best

08:45.726 --> 08:48.693
to get the Ruby Heart
of Hearts, and so have you.

08:48.695 --> 08:52.163
Our best, however,
isn't good enough. [sighs]

08:52.165 --> 08:56.134
I always get my treasure,
but not this time.

08:56.136 --> 08:59.304
- But...
- Farewell, James.

08:59.306 --> 09:03.708
It does indeed look like
our treasure hunt ends here.

09:03.710 --> 09:07.045
Red Jessica, wait!

09:07.047 --> 09:11.983
I will find a way to get
the treasure for her, I will!

09:11.985 --> 09:15.654
[stammers] My word!
What was I thinking?

09:15.656 --> 09:18.823
[exhales] Getting that
treasure is impossible!

09:18.825 --> 09:21.426
- [crumbling]
- Whoa!

09:21.428 --> 09:22.727
[gasps]

09:22.729 --> 09:25.897
Yay-hey, no way!
We've got to save Hook!

09:25.899 --> 09:29.167
- It's pixie dust time!
- [screams]

09:31.604 --> 09:34.839
What? How?
Puny pirates?

09:34.841 --> 09:37.342
Finish your treasure hunt,
Captain Hook.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.779
Fly over and get the Ruby Heart
of Hearts for Red Jessica.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.682
[grunts] Got it!

09:43.684 --> 09:45.951
Yay-hey, yes way!

09:45.953 --> 09:49.754
We helped Captain Hook and we
got five more gold doubloons.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.657
Let's grab them and go!

09:55.861 --> 09:57.596
Forget something?

09:57.598 --> 10:00.699
Captain Hook?
Uh, James?

10:00.701 --> 10:05.103
The one and only!
This is for you.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.906
The Ruby Heart of Hearts!

10:07.908 --> 10:10.976
You truly are great
and glorious!

10:10.978 --> 10:13.712
I always get my treasure, but...

10:13.714 --> 10:16.081
...you got the treasure for me.

10:16.083 --> 10:19.718
The Ruby Heart of Hearts
is all yours,

10:19.720 --> 10:25.490
- to keep forever.
- Oh, James!

10:25.492 --> 10:28.293
- Good work, Hook!
- Hooray for Captain Hook!

10:28.295 --> 10:29.494
Whoo-hoo!

10:29.496 --> 10:31.429
Oh, my!

10:31.431 --> 10:34.633
The captain has finally
found his treasure.

10:34.635 --> 10:39.070
- He's happy!
- And that makes me happy, too!

10:39.072 --> 10:41.306
[sobbing]

10:42.908 --> 10:44.776
Yo-ho, way to go!

10:44.778 --> 10:46.578
Thanks for helping
Captain Hook

10:46.580 --> 10:48.446
find the Ruby Heart
of Hearts.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.649
Now let's put all our
gold doubloons

10:50.651 --> 10:53.018
into our
Team Treasure Chest.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.661
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:02.663 --> 11:04.796
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:04.798 --> 11:06.798
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:06.800 --> 11:09.501
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:09.503 --> 11:12.037
Come on. Count with us!

11:13.039 --> 11:14.739
[all] Yeah!

11:16.008 --> 11:17.809
[Jake] One, two...

11:17.811 --> 11:20.278
[Cubby] Three, four, five...

11:20.280 --> 11:24.716
[Izzy] Six, seven,
eight, nine, ten!

11:24.718 --> 11:27.786
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:27.788 --> 11:31.056
we got ten gold doubloons!

11:31.058 --> 11:34.025
And I've got something
for all of you.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.696
Awesome! Friendship bracelets
made out of seashells.

11:37.698 --> 11:41.700
So that's why you collected
so many seashells today!

11:41.702 --> 11:46.771
Sweet crackers! I hope Captain
Hook is as happy as we are!

11:48.741 --> 11:51.743
Oh, woe is me!

11:53.679 --> 11:59.651
[inhales deeply] Do you think I
will ever see Red Jessica again?

11:59.653 --> 12:01.886
[Smee] Of course
you will, Captain.

12:01.888 --> 12:06.257
You can look at her picture
every day until... [grunts]

12:07.026 --> 12:11.796
- Whoopsie.
- [Hook] Smee!

12:14.900 --> 12:18.203
<i>[Jake]</i> The Never Land
Pirate Ball.

12:18.205 --> 12:21.005
[Hook] Mr. Smee,
full speed ahead!

12:21.007 --> 12:22.674
I don't want to
miss a moment

12:22.676 --> 12:26.578
of Red Jessica's
Never Land Pirate Ball.

12:26.580 --> 12:30.381
When Red Jessica sees me dance,

12:30.383 --> 12:34.686
she's certain to honor me with
the Best of the Ball prize:

12:34.688 --> 12:37.922
A rose from her garden.

12:37.924 --> 12:42.727
Uh, Captain, perhaps you should
practice the "Never Land Waltz."

12:42.729 --> 12:46.865
[stammers] Me? Practice?
[chuckles] Ridiculous!

12:46.867 --> 12:52.871
I am the finest dancer
in Never Land. Observe.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.839
[down-tempo music plays]

12:57.710 --> 13:00.578
- Oh! [grunts]
- Oh, dear.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.615
I'm afraid our captain
will be very disappointed

13:03.617 --> 13:06.584
if he doesn't win
that Best of the Ball Rose.

13:06.586 --> 13:11.322
Crimson Castle,
Home of Red Jessica.

13:11.324 --> 13:15.627
Come on, mateys!
Let's practice the "Never
Sea Waltz" one more time.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.328
[up-tempo music plays]

13:17.330 --> 13:21.432
<i>¶ Take three steps</i>
<i>Slide your foot to the side ¶</i>

13:21.434 --> 13:24.969
<i>¶ Hop three times</i>
<i>Hop, hop, hop ¶</i>

13:24.971 --> 13:28.673
<i>¶ Twirl this-a way</i>
<i>Twirl that-a way ¶</i>

13:28.675 --> 13:33.077
<i>¶ Now turn to your partner</i>
<i>and curtsey or bow ¶</i>

13:33.079 --> 13:36.314
[Smee] You sea pups
certainly can dance.

13:36.316 --> 13:41.019
- [all] Ahoy, Mr. Smee!
- Hello, puny pirates.

13:41.021 --> 13:44.689
Will you be there
to see Red Jessica award me

13:44.691 --> 13:47.592
the Best of the
Ball Rose?

13:47.594 --> 13:51.362
- We will be at the ball.
- All of us were invited.

13:51.364 --> 13:54.632
Splendid. Ta-ta, popinjays.

13:54.634 --> 13:59.437
- See you at the ball.
- Captain has his heart
set on winning.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.873
But he doesn't know
any dance steps.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.209
I know!
Me and my crew

14:04.211 --> 14:06.611
can teach Hook to do
the "Never Sea Waltz."

14:06.613 --> 14:08.379
We'll show him
the dance steps

14:08.381 --> 14:10.515
on the way up to
Red Jessica's Castle,

14:10.517 --> 14:12.984
and he'll never
know we helped.

14:12.986 --> 14:16.521
Mateys, will you help us teach
Captain Hook the dance steps

14:16.523 --> 14:18.223
to the "Never Sea Waltz"?

14:19.792 --> 14:23.728
Great! Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

14:23.730 --> 14:27.165
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

14:27.167 --> 14:30.969
Then we'll collect them and put
them in our Team Treasure Chest!

14:33.806 --> 14:36.908
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away </i>

14:36.910 --> 14:39.077
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

14:39.079 --> 14:40.545
<i>¶ Let's go! </i>

14:40.547 --> 14:44.082
<i>¶ Heave-ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

14:44.084 --> 14:47.218
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land pirates ¶</i>

14:47.220 --> 14:49.153
<i>¶ And me </i>

14:53.058 --> 14:55.693
[grunts] There!

14:55.695 --> 14:57.929
That should send Hook
up the twisty path,

14:57.931 --> 15:00.231
where we'll be
waiting for him.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.468
- [Hook] Follow me, boys!
- Quick! Hide!

15:04.603 --> 15:07.138
[Hook] The sign
points this way.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.608
Old Feather Hat fell for it!

15:10.610 --> 15:16.414
First we have to teach
Hook to take three steps,
and slide to the side.

15:16.416 --> 15:21.119
I know just the place to do
that: Bouncing Rock Ravine.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.422
[rumbling]

15:24.424 --> 15:27.759
Blast! A rumbling
river of rock.

15:27.761 --> 15:31.629
- How am I to get across this?
- [Jake] I know!

15:31.631 --> 15:36.234
- Jake, the puny pirate?
- Don't want to be
late to the ball.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.470
I can step, step,
step, slide.

15:39.472 --> 15:43.241
Step, step, step, slide.
Step, step, step, slide.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.543
See you mateys at the ball!

15:45.545 --> 15:47.612
Looks like Jake
knew how to...

15:47.614 --> 15:50.748
I don't need help
from a popinjay, Smee!

15:50.750 --> 15:53.785
I was going to do
exactly what he did!

15:53.787 --> 15:57.822
Step, step, step, slide.
Step, step, step, slide.

15:57.824 --> 16:02.293
All right! We helped Hook learn
the three-steps-and-slide move.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.595
And we got three gold doubloons.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.899
Let's grab them and go show him
the next dance move.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.571
- [croaking]
- [groans in disgust]

16:13.573 --> 16:18.343
Smee, there are big,
red frogs in this pool!

16:18.345 --> 16:21.746
Ahoy, Captain Hook!
Mind if I go first?

16:21.748 --> 16:24.849
We play leapfrog all the
time on Pirate Island.

16:24.851 --> 16:28.753
Hop and hop and hop!

16:28.755 --> 16:32.423
So long!
See you at Crimson Castle.

16:32.425 --> 16:37.962
Oh, Izzy hopped over the
icky frog tongues, Captain.

16:37.964 --> 16:42.467
I see that! But I have
another way in mind.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.868
Follow me, men!

16:43.870 --> 16:47.138
Jump and jump and jump!

16:47.140 --> 16:49.440
Yo-ho, way to go!

16:49.442 --> 16:53.845
Hook can hop, or jump,
three times forward.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.547
That's one more
dance move he's got down.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.384
And we got three
more gold doubloons!

16:59.386 --> 17:02.587
Let's grab them and go show
Hook the last dance move.

17:05.457 --> 17:08.993
Oh. 'Tis Spinning
Vine Forest!

17:08.995 --> 17:10.528
I've heard
tell of vines

17:10.530 --> 17:13.197
that hug
unsuspecting pirates,

17:13.199 --> 17:16.200
- and never let go!
- We must push on.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.002
- [yells]
- You first, Smee.

17:18.004 --> 17:22.440
Coming through, Captain Hook!
See you at the big fancy dance!

17:25.244 --> 17:27.478
Ah, coconuts!

17:27.480 --> 17:31.082
Only way to wriggle free
is to twirl this-a way.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.584
[giggles] And twirl that-a way.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.223
Twirl this-a way!
Twirl that-a way!

17:39.225 --> 17:42.527
Oh, seems Cubby's
twirling motions

17:42.529 --> 17:45.663
- got him through, Captain.
- Well, let me see.

17:48.434 --> 17:51.402
Twirl this-a way,
twirl that-a way.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.672
twirl that-a way.
Twirl this-a way,

17:54.674 --> 17:57.675
Come along,
ye louts, and twirl!

17:58.577 --> 18:00.044
It worked!

18:00.046 --> 18:02.713
We got Hook to learn
the dance move.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.516
And we got three
more gold doubloons!

18:05.518 --> 18:07.785
Let's grab them
and go have fun

18:07.787 --> 18:09.754
at the Never Land
Pirate Ball.

18:12.891 --> 18:16.027
Crimson Castle!
I've made it!

18:16.029 --> 18:19.430
Red Jessica! Captain Hook...

18:19.432 --> 18:23.067
I mean, James is here!

18:23.069 --> 18:25.703
Hi, Mr. Smee,
Sharky and Bones.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.573
Well, howdy-do, sea pups!

18:28.575 --> 18:31.609
What a beautiful ballroom.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.078
[Red Jessica] Ahoy,
pirates of Never Land!

18:34.080 --> 18:36.814
Welcome to my Pirate Ball!

18:39.318 --> 18:43.054
Ahoy, James.
You look quite dashing.

18:43.056 --> 18:46.657
[stammers]
Thank you, Red Jessica.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.993
[up-tempo music plays]

18:50.796 --> 18:54.098
Ah! The "Never Sea Waltz"!

18:54.100 --> 18:56.801
James, shall we dance?

18:56.803 --> 19:00.571
- [stammering]
- Why, he'd love to! [chuckles]

19:00.573 --> 19:03.774
Smee, I was wrong.
I can't dance!

19:03.776 --> 19:07.745
Red Jessica will soon
know I've got two left feet.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.982
Now, Captain,
I'm sure if you concentrate,

19:10.984 --> 19:14.619
you'll find you know more
of the steps than you think.

19:14.621 --> 19:18.823
Mateys, looks like Hook's
gonna need a little more help.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.925
Let's hit the floor!

19:20.927 --> 19:25.596
See, Captain, the first move
is three steps and a slide.

19:25.598 --> 19:29.700
You used that very move
crossing Bouncing Rock Ravine.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.470
Step, step, step, slide.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.505
Yes, Smee, I remember!

19:34.507 --> 19:37.708
Go on, sir,
dance with Red Jessica.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.577
It will come back to you.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.882
Step, step, step, slide.

19:44.884 --> 19:48.786
Remember, Cubby,
the next move is three hops.

19:48.788 --> 19:53.624
It's the move I used to get
past those big red frogs today.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.394
Jump, jump, jump.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.496
Get ready to twirl, mateys,

19:58.498 --> 20:02.366
like I did today
at Spinning Vine Forest!

20:02.368 --> 20:06.170
Twirl this-a way,
twirl that-a way.

20:06.172 --> 20:09.807
And this I know
how to do well.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.547
James, you can
really move.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.150
You commanded
the "Never Sea Waltz."

20:19.152 --> 20:23.421
And so, this year's
Best of the Ball Rose

20:23.423 --> 20:25.923
goes to... you!

20:25.925 --> 20:27.992
Hooray for Captain Hook!

20:27.994 --> 20:30.361
- Hip-hip...
- [all] Hooray!

20:30.363 --> 20:33.531
Thank you for the
wonderful honor.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.901
Thank you for the
shipshape waltz.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.538
Oh, it came easy after
the challenging obstacles

20:40.540 --> 20:42.540
on the path
to your castle.

20:42.542 --> 20:46.410
- Obstacles?
- Bouncing Rock Ravine.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.779
Icky Big Red Frog Pond.

20:48.781 --> 20:52.683
And, of course, the
Forest of Spinning Vines.

20:52.685 --> 20:56.687
James, why did you take
the long way to the castle?

20:56.689 --> 21:00.424
- But I followed the sign.
- Oh, James!

21:00.426 --> 21:03.361
Someone played
a pirate prank on you.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.264
Red roses,
that's a good one!

21:06.266 --> 21:09.700
Yes. Hilarious.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.269
Would you excuse me?

21:11.271 --> 21:15.139
I know what you popinjays did.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.742
And I thank you all!
[chuckles]

21:17.744 --> 21:19.610
For teaching me those steps,

21:19.612 --> 21:23.414
and helping me to win
the Best of the Ball Rose

21:23.416 --> 21:26.651
from my sweet Red Jessica.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.553
Oh, you're welcome,
Captain Hook.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.789
Who wants to join me
in the next dance?

21:31.791 --> 21:35.826
One anyone can do.
The "Rattle Your Bones"!

21:35.828 --> 21:38.162
[up-tempo music plays]

21:38.164 --> 21:40.231
<i>¶ You've got to</i>
<i>shake it up, wake it up ¶</i>

<i>Wake it up ¶</i>

21:45.271 --> 21:47.738
¶ Rattle them skeleton bones

21:49.608 --> 21:52.810
Mateys, thanks for helping
teach Captain Hook the steps

21:52.812 --> 21:55.646
he needed to win
that prize rose.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.682
Let's count our gold doubloons

21:57.684 --> 21:59.984
and put them in our
Team Treasure Chest.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.593
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

22:09.595 --> 22:11.662

22:16.703 --> 22:19.070
Come on! Count with us.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.672
[all] Yeah!

22:22.841 --> 22:25.142
[Jake] One, two, three...

22:25.144 --> 22:27.712
[Izzy] Four, five, six...

22:27.714 --> 22:30.681
[Cubby] Seven, eight, nine!

22:30.683 --> 22:33.684
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:33.686 --> 22:36.187
we got nine gold doubloons.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.457
Let's keep on dancing!

22:39.459 --> 22:40.624
Hit it, Skully!

What a wonderful time!

22:50.236 --> 22:53.738
I could have danced all night.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.740
- [screams]
- [splashing]
