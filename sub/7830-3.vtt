You know, on the series

we were always trying
to kill the Cartwrights.

Look, Marge!

01:27.378 --> 01:29.923
They opened a new
high-tech gadget store!

01:30.006 --> 01:32.175
-You love high-tech gadgets.
-No, I don't.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.385

Come on.

Homer, please!
You're hurting my arm!

(laughs)
No, I'm not!

01:38.264 --> 01:39.516
Hey, Lis.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.810
Check out this
space-age toothbrush.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.395
That's an electric
nostril groomer.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.563

Night vision goggles?

A bathroom scale

01:51.027 --> 01:53.279
A suede briefcase case?

01:53.363 --> 01:56.324
Mm. Anyone who needs
this kind of status symbol

01:56.407 --> 01:59.160

Show everybody!

02:08.503 --> 02:09.838
Yes, finally!

02:09.921 --> 02:12.841
I would like to return
your "ultimate belt."

02:12.924 --> 02:15.844
I see. Do you have
a "receipt," sir?

02:15.927 --> 02:17.387
No, I do not have
a receipt.

02:17.470 --> 02:20.223
I won it as a door prize
at the Star Trek convention

02:20.306 --> 02:23.059
although I find their choice
of prize highly illogical

02:23.143 --> 02:24.435
as the average Trekker

02:24.519 --> 02:26.688
has no use for
a medium-sized belt.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.065
Whoa, whoa! A fat,
sarcastic "Star Trek" fan.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.442
You must be a devil
with the ladies.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.862
Hey, I-- that-- Oh...

02:33.945 --> 02:36.197
Gee, I hate to let
you down, Casanova,

02:36.281 --> 02:38.449
but no receipt,
no return.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.911
I'll give you
four bucks for it.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.079

02:43.163 --> 02:44.455
Very well.
I must hurry back

02:44.539 --> 02:46.124

02:46.207 --> 02:49.502

rather than absorb them.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.463
Wow! I bet if God
wore pants

02:52.547 --> 02:54.674
he'd have a belt
like that!

02:54.757 --> 02:56.092
This isn't a belt.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.011
It's a tactical
pants-retaining system.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.929
Check it out:
Compass, matches,

03:00.013 --> 03:02.390
whistle, saw,
panic button, squirrel snare,

radon/lie detector,
sphygmomanometer,

turn signals.

a piece of extension cord.

Hey, dude, he's ragging
on your cord.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.243

03:25.413 --> 03:27.123
No running.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.125

evasive action.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.788
Hey! What happened
to your belt?

04:06.871 --> 04:09.290
Some bullies beat me up
and took it.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.085
Son, there's only one thing
punks like that understand--

04:12.168 --> 04:13.336
squealing.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.672
You've got to squeal
to every teacher

04:15.755 --> 04:17.548
and every grown-up
you can find.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.467
Coming to me
was a good start.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.720
But then they'll just
beat me up even worse!

04:22.804 --> 04:26.099
Yes. They are a clever bunch.

04:26.182 --> 04:29.477
I know. I'll squeal for you--
to their parents.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.729
(grunting)

04:31.813 --> 04:33.356
JIMBO'S FATHER: That's for telling me
how to raise my lousy kid.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.566

the crummy life

04:36.693 --> 04:38.695
The thing is--

04:38.778 --> 04:41.364
Bart really loves
that belt, and--

04:41.447 --> 04:42.865
Hey, something's wrong
with this guy.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.450
He's not falling down!

04:44.534 --> 04:46.661
-(shotgun cocking)
-MOE: Fun's over, fellas.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.955
If you're gonna beat up
my friend in my bar

04:49.038 --> 04:51.332
there's a
two-drink minimum.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.836
Geez, Homer,
I never seen

04:54.919 --> 04:57.338
a guy stand up to that
kind of punishment.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.465
I mean, you took
a three-man pounding

04:59.549 --> 05:01.467
and didn't even fall down.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.470
Big deal. I didn't even
get my kid's belt back.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.140
The only thing a loser
like me is good for

05:07.223 --> 05:08.516
is taking beatings.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.768
There you go!
That's the spirit!

05:10.852 --> 05:12.437
Homer, I've seen
prizefighters

05:12.520 --> 05:15.356
couldn't take a punch
half as good as you.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.067
You know, boxing might be
right up your alley.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.111
-Really?
-Oh, please!

05:20.194 --> 05:21.195
It's
the good life, Homer.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.156
Some of these boxers

05:23.239 --> 05:25.950
they eat steak and
lobster and salad bar

05:26.034 --> 05:27.201
all in a single meal.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.037
(gasps)
Dressing?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.289
Their choice.

05:31.372 --> 05:33.291
You really think
I could do it?

05:33.374 --> 05:35.168
Well, I don't know.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.919
Are you man enough to test
every one of your limits?

05:37.003 --> 05:39.505
-Yes.
-And are you man enough

05:39.589 --> 05:41.090
to throw a punch,
should the opportunity arise?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.092
-Yes!
-And are you

05:43.176 --> 05:44.344
man enough to give me
a 60% cut?

05:44.427 --> 05:45.845
-Yes!
-I'll take it.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.305
Woo-hoo!

05:50.099 --> 05:51.601
MOE: Now Homer,

05:51.684 --> 05:53.019
if I'm going to manage
your boxing career,

05:53.102 --> 05:54.312
I want you to have
complete faith in me.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.230
Here, let me show you something.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.358
Wow, I've never
been in here before.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.109
Yeah, well, when I realized

06:00.193 --> 06:02.487
we hadn't had no ladies in here
since 1979

06:02.570 --> 06:04.030
I turned it into an office.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.327
You used to be a boxer
just like me?

06:09.410 --> 06:11.287
Yep. They called me
"Kid Gorgeous."

06:11.371 --> 06:13.623
Later on, it was
"Kid Presentable."

06:13.706 --> 06:14.957
Then "Kid Gruesome,"

06:15.041 --> 06:16.292
and finally, "Kid Moe."

06:16.376 --> 06:17.752
Hey, what's this?

06:17.835 --> 06:20.129
Aw, that's my old
spit bucket.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.299
Yeah, I've been meaning
to empty that out.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.802
(gasps)
You know Lucius Sweet?!

06:25.885 --> 06:28.304
He's one of
the biggest names in boxing.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.598
He's exactly as rich
and as famous

06:30.681 --> 06:33.434
as Don King and he looks
just like him too.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.061
Yeah, he was my manager.

06:35.144 --> 06:37.855
Back when I was gorgeous,
everybody wanted a piece of me,

06:37.939 --> 06:39.774
but somehow I just never made it
to the big time.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.192
Why not?

06:41.275 --> 06:43.194
'Cause I got knocked out
40 times in a row.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.655
That plus politics.
You know, it's all politics.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.240
Lousy Democrats.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.200
(Marge growling)

06:49.283 --> 06:51.577
Homer, of all
the crazy ideas you've had

06:51.661 --> 06:54.539
this one ranks
somewhere in the middle.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.873
You're 38 years old.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.500
You don't know how to box

06:57.583 --> 07:00.711
and you haven't gotten
any exercise since grade school.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.673
Before you even consider this,
I insist you consult a doctor.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.551
No <i>problemo.</i>

07:06.634 --> 07:08.094
A competent doctor!

07:08.177 --> 07:09.554
HOMER: D'oh!

07:09.637 --> 07:11.931
Well, sir, you more than meet

07:12.014 --> 07:14.392
every one of this state's
requirements

07:14.475 --> 07:16.686
to box, wrestle
or be shot out of a cannon.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.688
(growling)
That's what we get

07:18.771 --> 07:21.315
for living in a state
founded by circus freaks.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.193
You have an absolutely unique
genetic condition

07:24.277 --> 07:26.320
known as
"Homer Simpson syndrome."

07:26.404 --> 07:27.947
Oh, why me?!

07:28.030 --> 07:29.449
Don't worry,
it's quite beneficial.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.617
Your brain is cushioned
by a layer of fluid

07:31.701 --> 07:33.578
one-eighth of an inch thicker
than normal.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.413
It's almost as if you're wearing

07:35.496 --> 07:36.998
a football helmet
inside your head.

07:37.081 --> 07:40.668
Why, I could wallop you all day
with this surgical 2x4

07:40.751 --> 07:44.505
without ever knocking you down,
but I have other appointments.

07:44.589 --> 07:48.134
All right, Homer
let's see the left.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.427
(grunts)

07:50.803 --> 07:52.930
O-kay.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.015
Let's see the right.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.558
(panting)

07:55.641 --> 07:56.642
Just a second.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.727
When you're ready.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.020
All right.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.354
I'm ready.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.439
Wait a minute.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.607
All right.

08:02.690 --> 08:05.401
Wait a minute.
Just a second.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.446
Okay, punching isn't your thing,
but that's okay.

08:08.529 --> 08:09.906
You're not that kind
of fighter.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.407
What you're going to do
is stand there

08:11.491 --> 08:14.327
while your opponent gets
exhausted from overpunching.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.078
Then I can just push him over.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.830
That's right, and if the ref's
not looking

08:17.914 --> 08:19.749
you can kick him
a couple of times.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.710
-Who's gonna knock you down?
-No one.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.587
-When are you gonna fight back?
-Never!

08:24.670 --> 08:26.589
-What are you gonna do?
-Nothing!

08:26.672 --> 08:27.673
That's my boy!

08:30.551 --> 08:33.471
Man, you'd never get me
into a ring.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.848
Boxing causes brain damage.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.645
Okay, you're fighting
a guy named Boxcar Bob.

08:40.728 --> 08:43.231
Brawled his way up
from the boxcars, did he?

08:43.314 --> 08:44.482
No, not yet.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.442
He still lives
at the train yard

08:46.526 --> 08:48.486
but he's a hungry
young fighter.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.614
In fact, he's actually
fighting for a sandwich.

08:51.697 --> 08:55.159
Homer, I want you to
have my lucky mitts.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.912
I hope you do better
with them than I did.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.121
Gee, thanks, Moe.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.456
What's this?

09:00.540 --> 09:01.707
Ah, that's the barbed wire.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.043
We called that
"the stinger."

09:04.126 --> 09:06.379
They don't let you
use that no more.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.340
Now, no matter
how much he hits you,

09:09.423 --> 09:11.050
you don't do
nothing, okay?

09:11.133 --> 09:12.301
You don't want
to get drawn

09:12.385 --> 09:13.803
into a boxing
match here.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.892
(bell rings)

09:25.565 --> 09:27.608
Way to go, Dad!
Take those punches!

09:27.692 --> 09:29.735
Man, that tramp's
got the energy of a hobo.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.445
Yeah, he never
stops punching

09:31.529 --> 09:33.281
except to check
out his bindle.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.793
Okay, Homer, he's tired.
He's tired.

09:45.876 --> 09:49.005
Now's your chance.
Nudge him, nudge him.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.730
Hello, Moe.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.983
Delightful to see you again.

10:51.067 --> 10:54.737
Lucius! Hey, what's a glitterati
like you doing in my dump?

10:54.820 --> 10:56.947
I thought you were managing
the champ.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.202
Yes, managing Drederick
has been my highest priority

11:01.285 --> 11:03.663
even though he is
temporarily incarcerated

11:03.746 --> 11:05.831
for pushing his mother
down the stairs,

11:05.915 --> 11:07.833
but with his
impending release

11:07.917 --> 11:10.336
I've been strategizing
for his glorious return

11:10.419 --> 11:11.879
to the shores of fistiana.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.798
Uh... what?

11:13.881 --> 11:15.549
His comeback fight.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.093
You know-- boxing?

11:17.176 --> 11:18.761
Oh, man. Yeah.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.681
Well, who's donating his body
for that one, huh?

11:21.764 --> 11:25.643
Well, word is you manage
a stalwart young pugilist

11:25.726 --> 11:27.520
who cannot be knocked down.

11:27.603 --> 11:28.854
Homer?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.564
You want Homer to fight Tatum?

11:30.648 --> 11:33.484
Well, the fans are weary
of fights that are over

11:33.567 --> 11:35.194
before they have
an opportunity

11:35.277 --> 11:37.321
to even get drunk.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.572
I just need a body

11:38.656 --> 11:40.491
who can sustain
verticality

11:40.574 --> 11:41.909
for three rounds.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.953
Yeah, but Homer's no boxer.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.705
He's just a freak.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.331
Tatum will fustigate him.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
Well, fustigation aside, Moe,

11:49.208 --> 11:50.793
you've got a choice.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.962
You can either sit here
in the ladies' room

11:53.045 --> 11:54.797
with your faded memories,

11:54.880 --> 11:58.718
or you can take your last shot
at the big time

11:58.801 --> 12:00.511
and I can make it happen.

12:00.594 --> 12:01.846
(jingling)

12:01.929 --> 12:04.432
Three rounds.
That's all I ask.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.568
I got to be honest
with you, Homer.

12:15.651 --> 12:18.738
I didn't bring you up here
to show you my new tar paper.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.739
You didn't?

12:19.822 --> 12:21.741
No. Homer,
how would you like

12:21.824 --> 12:23.868
to be heavyweight champion
of the world?

12:23.951 --> 12:25.453
-Oh, sure.
-Great.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.997
All you got to do
is fight Drederick Tatum.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.707
It's this Saturday.
Here's your parking pass.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.876
Ooh. "General."

12:31.959 --> 12:33.878
Who's Drederick Tatum,
anyway?

12:33.961 --> 12:36.005
-Is he another hobo?
-Uh... you know what?

12:36.088 --> 12:37.965
I'm gonna have to
check on that.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.508
Well, I trust you, Moe.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.968
If you say I can
beat this guy

12:41.051 --> 12:42.845
then he doesn't
stand a chance.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.931
(alarm wailing)

12:46.015 --> 12:48.517
(shouting)

12:48.601 --> 12:50.311
Hey, guys, come on.
Shut up.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.771
(silence)

12:51.854 --> 12:53.773
We didn't know
you were here.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.358
-Sorry, champ.
-It was Jerry.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.740
MAN 1:
Champ, champ.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.492
Do you feel remorse
for your crime?

13:04.575 --> 13:06.410
Oh, yes.
Believe me, my God,

13:06.494 --> 13:09.455
if I could turn back the clock
on my mother's stair pushing,

13:09.538 --> 13:11.332
I would certainly reconsider it.

13:11.415 --> 13:14.418
MAN 2: Drederick, what do you think
of Homer Simpson?

13:14.502 --> 13:15.461
I think he's a good man,
I like him.

13:15.544 --> 13:17.254
I got nothing against him,

13:17.338 --> 13:19.256
but I'm definitely gonna
make orphans of his children.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.342
MAN 3: You know,
they do have a mother, champ.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.136
Yes, but I would imagine
that she would die of grief.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.513
(reporters shouting)

13:25.596 --> 13:27.056
Thank you, thank you

13:27.139 --> 13:29.683
but the champ has no time
for further queries.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.644
This parole hearing
is over.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.312
(reporters groaning)

13:33.395 --> 13:35.856
I wanted to know what it was
like in prison.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.902
Homer,
why are they saying

13:39.985 --> 13:42.696
you're going to fight
Drederick Tatum?

13:42.780 --> 13:43.948
(gulps)

13:44.031 --> 13:46.867
Uh... well...

13:46.951 --> 13:50.579
I was gonna
surprise you, but...

13:50.663 --> 13:52.122
happy anniversary, baby!

13:52.206 --> 13:53.916
Have you lost your mind?!

13:53.999 --> 13:55.543
Oh, come on!

13:55.626 --> 13:57.586
I'll make a fortune
for one night's work.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.339
We can have all the things
we always dreamed of--

14:00.422 --> 14:02.174
a snooty butler,
carpeted carports,

14:02.258 --> 14:04.718
those blue cupcakes
they sell sometimes--

14:04.802 --> 14:05.970
But you'll get killed.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.680
Marge, will you
let me finish?

14:07.763 --> 14:09.223
Plug-in room
deodorizers,

14:09.306 --> 14:11.475
front and rear spoilers
for the car.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.935
Mom's right, Dad.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.646
The odds against you winning
are a thousand to one.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.147
I don't think
it's that unlikely.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.149
Those are the odds
they're giving in Vegas.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.609
All right

14:20.693 --> 14:23.821
I think we've heard
just about enough

14:23.904 --> 14:25.698
from Mr. Newspaper today.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.326

BART:
You'll be okay, Dad.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.607
Just make sure he hits you
an even number of times

14:59.690 --> 15:01.191

with amnesia.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.700
Moe, I'm so glad
I found you.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.328
Please, promise me
you won't let Homer get hurt.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.413
Hey, I'm not the
villain here, okay?

15:14.496 --> 15:15.956
If Homer gets killed
in the ring tonight,

15:16.040 --> 15:17.541
it will be because of
your negative attitude.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.461
-There, I said it.
-Listen to me!

15:20.544 --> 15:22.338
The instant that Homer's
in any kind of danger,

15:22.421 --> 15:23.881
I want you to
throw in this towel

15:23.964 --> 15:25.341
and stop the fight!

15:25.424 --> 15:28.010
All right, all right,
all right, I promise, okay?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.137

16:26.026 --> 16:27.987
Now I've got to comb
this side over.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.575
All right, Homer,
I'm not gonna lie to you--

16:33.659 --> 16:36.245
there's a good chance
you can beat Tatum

16:36.328 --> 16:39.581
but you've got to visualize
how you're gonna win, okay?

16:39.665 --> 16:40.874
Gotcha.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.918
(crowd cheering)

16:43.002 --> 16:46.547
A congenital heart defect
has apparently felled Tatum

16:46.630 --> 16:49.591
moments before he could
step into the ring.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.845
And now, please welcome back

Because if he goes down

-No.
-Uh-oh.

You know what's great there

19:05.060 --> 19:07.312
Homer, he's not going
to get tired.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.273
You've got
to hit him back.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.150
Hit him back!

19:11.233 --> 19:13.944
HOMER:
<i>That cactus is right.</i>

<i>I've only got one chance.</i>

20:13.253 --> 20:15.214
Simpson's manager

20:15.297 --> 20:18.467
has flown into the ring
and is airlifting him out.

Ladies and gentlemen,

20:20.010 --> 20:22.888

remained in boxing

the window.

20:25.807 --> 20:26.934
Are you an angel?

20:27.017 --> 20:28.769
Yes, Homer, I'm an angel.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.854
All us angels
wear Farah slacks.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.731
But you stopped the fight.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.942
Won't everyone
be mad at you?

20:35.025 --> 20:36.151
Let them be mad.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.528
The only thing
that matters to me

20:38.612 --> 20:39.738
is you're safe.

20:39.821 --> 20:40.781
D'oh!

20:40.864 --> 20:42.157
Sorry.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.331
Homer, your manager

20:49.414 --> 20:51.208
obviously loves
you very much.

20:51.291 --> 20:54.419
Lucius, would you
do that for me?

20:54.503 --> 20:55.879
Absolutely, I would.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.256
Now get in the van.

20:59.049 --> 21:02.552
You couldn't even give me
one lousy round, Moe.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.388
You will always
be a loser.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.765
Now take your check
for $100,000

21:06.848 --> 21:08.642
and get out
of my sight.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.936
I don't need
your stinking money.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.399
Oh, Homie, are you okay?

21:15.482 --> 21:18.819
I can't remember
where we parked.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.404
That's all right.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.864
We'll just wait till
everyone else leaves.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.574
I got your tooth, Dad.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.787
Uh, not mine.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.247
Thank you, Moe.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.833
I know you gave up
your dreams for Homer.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.961
Well, what do dreams
matter, Marge?

21:36.044 --> 21:38.839
I was able to stick up
for a pal.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.799
Well, so long, Springfield.

21:40.882 --> 21:41.842
Where are you going?

21:41.925 --> 21:44.594
Nowheres in particular.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.388
I just need some time to think.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.225
Hey, there you are!

21:50.309 --> 21:51.852
You give me
that contraption back!
