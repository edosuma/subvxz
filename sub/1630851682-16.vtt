BIBLICAL VENGEANCE TO WASH AWAY
THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY ALL THE

LAST WEEK GOVERNOR DeSANTIS

04:44.818 --> 04:47.787
I'M HEARING WE ACTUALLY HAVE A

HELLO?

04:50.490 --> 04:54.961
MR. PRESIDENT, ARE YOU ON THE
FACE-TIME?

04:54.961 --> 04:58.798
HELLO, FRIENDS.

>> MR. PRESIDENT.

04:58.798 --> 05:04.037
WOW.

THANKS FOR FITTING US INTO YOUR

05:04.037 --> 05:08.208

05:08.208 --> 05:13.046
AND THE WEDDING RECEPTIONS AND
GETTING CLUMPS OF BACON WITH
TONGS AT BREAKFAST BAR.

05:13.046 --> 05:17.050
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WELL, SO MUCH TO DISCUSS, BUT
I'VE GOT TO ASK, SIR, DID YOU

05:17.050 --> 05:23.890
SEE THE FAMOUS SLAP?
>> YOU KNOW, I DID SEE SLAP.
I ENJOYED SLAP.

05:23.890 --> 05:30.430
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY HITCH.
QUITE AN ARM ON HITCH.
I ALWAYS KNEW HITCH HAD AN ARM.

05:30.430 --> 05:35.068
BACK IN "PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS,"
HE'S LUGGING THE MACHINE ON AND
OFF THE SUBWAY.

05:35.068 --> 05:39.239
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.
THEY SLEPT IN THE BATHROOM IN
THAT MOVIE.

05:39.239 --> 05:43.510
IT'S SO SAD.
IT'S SO SAD.
[ LAUGHTER ]

05:43.510 --> 05:45.812
BUT IT'S A SAD NIGHT FOR HITCH
TOO.
THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS NOT

05:45.812 --> 05:48.782
GOING TO HELP KEVIN JAMES GET A
DATE WITH ALLEGRA COLE.
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

05:48.782 --> 05:56.456
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AMEN TO THAT, SIR.

05:56.456 --> 06:00.727
>> NOW, SIR, THE JANUARY 6th
COMMITTEE IS GEARING UP TO MAKE
ALL SORTS OF CLAIMS.

06:00.727 --> 06:03.663
SO LET'S JUST PUT THIS TO REST.
DID YOU COMMIT A COUP, SIR?
>> NO.

06:03.663 --> 06:06.566
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE WAS NO COUP.
IT WAS AN EVENT.

06:06.566 --> 06:13.540
PERHAPS A TAKEBACK EVENT.
A COUP PERHAPS.
BUT I DON'T LIKE COUP.

06:13.540 --> 06:20.246
I JUST DON'T LIKE COUP.
I DON'T LIKE THE P AT THE END OF
COUP.

06:20.246 --> 06:23.850
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE P AND PUSH
IT.
IF YOU TAKE OFF P YOU HAVE COW

06:23.850 --> 06:30.857
WHICH GOES MOO, WHICH IS
PERHAPS WHERE THEY GET COUP.
BUT COULD COUP.

06:30.857 --> 06:35.695
WHO DO?
DO WHAT?
REMIND ME OF THE BABE.

06:35.695 --> 06:39.099
BUT IT WAS AN INTENTIONAL
PLANNED COUP, YES.
[ LAUGHTER ]

06:39.099 --> 06:44.304
>> RIGHT.
OKAY.
>> BUT THEY'RE SAYING THERE IS

06:44.304 --> 06:48.074
THIS SEVEN-HOUR GAP IN WHITE
HOUSE CALL LOGS THAT DAY.
YOU DIDN'T USE A BURNER PHONE,

06:48.074 --> 06:50.610
DID YOU, SIR?
>> NO.
NOT TRUE.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.645
NEVER USED BURNER PHONE EXCEPT
PERHAPS ON JANUARY 6th DURING
THAT SEVEN-HOUR PERIOD.

06:52.645 --> 06:56.783
[ LAUGHTER ]
I COULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT A
BURNER PHONE LOOKS LIKE,

06:56.783 --> 07:00.086
HONESTLY.
I WAS TOO BUSY WITH PHONE CALL
AND BURNER PHONE AND COUP.

07:00.086 --> 07:05.325
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> OKAY.
GOT YOU.

07:05.325 --> 07:08.528
BUT LET'S BE REAL, SIR.
THE LEFT WANTS TO PAINT JANUARY
6th AS SOME VIOLENT REVOLUTION.

07:08.528 --> 07:13.233
IT WASN'T.
>> COULD HAVE BEEN.
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE.

07:13.233 --> 07:17.604
VIOLENT IS -- VIOLENT IS PERHAPS
GOOD.
YOU KNOW, THEY USED TO DO

07:17.604 --> 07:25.378
VIOLENT ALL THE TIME.
YOU'D LINE UP THE OPPONENTS,
YOU'D GO BING, BING, BING,

07:25.378 --> 07:28.048
SHOOT THEM DEAD.
SO EASY.
[ LAUGHTER ]

07:28.048 --> 07:30.083
SOLVE SO MANY PROBLEMS.
YOU SHOOT THEM DEAD.
WITH A BIG FAT BEAUTIFUL

07:30.083 --> 07:37.390
UNCIRCUMCISED GUN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL A COUP.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.492
HEY, BY THE WAY, DID YOU HEAR
THIS?
I GOT A HOLE IN ONE.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.696
DID ANYBODY HEAR THAT?
>> YES, YES.
CONGRATS, SIR.

07:42.696 --> 07:48.301
PLEASE TELL US ABOUT IT.
>> YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE TO.
I'D LOVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT,

07:48.301 --> 07:50.704
BUT MY PHONE IS GETTING VERY,
VERY HOT TO THE TOUCH.
>> YOU'VE GOT TRUTH SOCIAL, SIR.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.373

07:53.373 --> 07:58.678

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.

10:46.046 --> 10:59.426
[ CHEERS ]
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT.
I WANT TO BE CLEAR UP TOP.

10:59.426 --> 11:05.398
I TALKED ABOUT IT ENOUGH.
KEPT TALKING ABOUT IT.
KEPT THINKING ABOUT IT.

11:05.398 --> 11:10.737
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
AND YOU CAN'T MAKE ME TALK ABOUT
IT.

11:10.737 --> 11:17.110
BUT -- I'VE GOT A QUESTION.
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
LIKE AREN'T YOU SICK OF TALKING

11:17.110 --> 11:20.080
ABOUT IT?
ISN'T IT KIND OF CRAZY -- IT
FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN TALKING

11:20.080 --> 11:30.357
ABOUT IT FOR SO LONG.
I HAVE -- THIS IS GOING TO
REALLY BLOW YOUR MINDS.

11:30.357 --> 11:34.394
CAN YOU BELIEVE --
IT'S BEEN SIX DAYS.
[ LAUGHTER ]

11:34.394 --> 11:36.429
SIX DAYS.
THIS HAPPENED A WEEK AGO.
DOESN'T IT FEEL LIKE IT HAPPENED

11:36.429 --> 11:39.632
YEARS AGO?
LIKE DOESN'T IT FEEL LIKE IT
HAPPENED WHEN WE WERE ALL IN

11:39.632 --> 11:52.145
HIGH SCHOOL?
[ LAUGHTER ]
LIKE IT FEELS LIKE IT HAPPENED

11:52.145 --> 11:59.219
BETWEEN JAMIROQUAI AND 9/11.
A LONG, LONG TIME AGO.
[ LAUGHTER ]

11:59.219 --> 12:07.193
IT HAPPENED ON SUNDAY.
SUNDAY.
IT'S SATURDAY, BRO.

12:07.193 --> 12:09.329
[ LAUGHTER ]
ON MONDAY IT WAS EXCITING.
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

12:09.329 --> 12:18.405
MONDAY -- IF THIS WERE MONDAY,
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET ME
TO SHUT UP ABOUT IT.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.641
I WAS TALKING ABOUT IT ALL
MONDAY.
TUESDAY, STILL TALKING ABOUT IT.

12:21.641 --> 12:25.245
A LITTLE LESS EXCITING BECAUSE
IT STOPPED BEING ABOUT IT ON
TUESDAY.

12:25.245 --> 12:32.419
IT STARTED BEING ABOUT A LOT OF
PROXY ARGUMENTS.
HAIR AND BLACK MEN AND WHITE

12:32.419 --> 12:39.192
PEOPLE ON TWITTER.
IT WAS JUST -- IT WAS TOO MUCH
BY TUESDAY.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.962
BY WEDNESDAY I WANTED TO KILL
MYSELF.
[ LAUGHTER ]

12:42.962 --> 12:48.635
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
THURSDAY.
BUT BY FRIDAY, BY FRIDAY I MADE

12:48.635 --> 12:53.940
A VOW TO MYSELF.
I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD NEVER,
EVER TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

12:53.940 --> 13:04.050
THEN LORNE CAME INTO MY DRESSING
ROOM.
[ LAUGHTER ]

13:04.050 --> 13:07.787
HE WAS LIKE, "I THINK YOU NEED
TO TALK ABOUT IT."
HE SAID THE NATION NEEDS TO

13:07.787 --> 13:16.429
HEAL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON ME,

13:16.429 --> 13:23.970
LORNE.
THE NATION NEEDS TO HEAL.
I SAID THE NATION NEEDS TO WHAT?

13:23.970 --> 13:33.980
YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT?
THE NATION DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.
THE NATION HAS NO CLUE WHO I AM.

13:33.980 --> 13:45.425
I HAVE TO BE THE LEAST FAMOUS
HOST IN "SNL" -- LIKE THE LEAST.
I WAS SO EXCITED TO COME HERE.

13:45.425 --> 13:54.601
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

13:54.601 --> 14:01.574
JUST KNOW THOSE CLAPS DID
NOTHING FOR MY SELF-ESTEEM.
[ LAUGHTER ]

14:01.574 --> 14:05.845
ALL YOU WERE DOING WAS -- WERE
YOU MAKING IT BETTER?
[ LAUGHTER ]

14:05.845 --> 14:09.649

VIRUS ITSELF PHYSICALLY

17:09.896 --> 17:13.800
SHRINKING OUR BRAINS, ONE
THING'S FOR SURE, WE GOT STUPID.
[ LAUGHTER ]

17:13.800 --> 17:16.936

17:34.387 --> 17:38.758
HOW ARE YOU?
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> UH-OH.

17:38.758 --> 17:42.896
AND VICTOR FROM NEW MEXICO.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY?
>> TIRED FOR NO REASON.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.798
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> TERRIFIC.
NOW, YOU ALL KNOW HOW THE GAME

17:44.798 --> 17:49.502
WORKS.
EVERY ANSWER IS SOMETHING YOU
DEFINITELY KNEW BEFORE COVID.

17:49.502 --> 17:53.239
BUT DOES YOUR BRAIN STILL
REMEMBER IT?
LET'S FIND OUT.

17:53.239 --> 17:59.179
FIRST QUESTION, WHAT IS THIS
CALLED?
[ LAUGHTER ]

17:59.179 --> 18:02.682
REMEMBER?
SOMETHING YOU USE TO CARRY
THINGS.

18:02.682 --> 18:06.286
>> BICYCLE?
>> NO.
NO.

18:06.286 --> 18:10.924
MIGHT SEE IT IN THE BACKYARD.

IT'S GOT A WHEEL IN THE FRONT.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.599
>> OOH.
SORRY.
WE WERE LOOKING FOR WHEELBARROW.

18:19.599 --> 18:23.503
>> I KNEW THAT.
>> YOU DID.
YOU DID KNOW THAT.

18:23.503 --> 18:28.475
IN 2019.
NOW IT'S JUST A FARM BICYCLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]

18:28.475 --> 18:33.580
OKAY, NEXT QUESTION, WHAT DAY OF
THE WEEK IS IT?
>> THAT'S EASY.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.783
TUESDAY?
>> NOPE.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.820
>> WHAT IS THURSDAY?
>> NO.
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PHRASE IT

18:40.820 --> 18:45.692
AS A QUESTION.
>> NO, I WAS GENUINELY ASKING.
WHAT IS THURSDAY?

18:45.692 --> 18:51.064
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> DEREK, WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK
IS IT?

18:51.064 --> 18:53.600
>> OKAY.
I REMEMBER YESTERDAY WAS MY
BIRTHDAY.

18:53.600 --> 18:58.071
AND MY BEST FRIEND TEXTED,
"BIRTHDAY ON A FRIDAY NIGHT,
DOG, WHAT ARE WE DOING TO

18:58.071 --> 19:03.043
CELEBRATE?"
AND I GOT SO ANXIOUS, I DIDN'T
RESPOND AND WENT TO SLEEP BEFORE

19:03.043 --> 19:06.746
5:00 P.M.
SO TODAY MUST BE SATURDAY?
>> CORRECT!

19:06.746 --> 19:12.018
YES.
[ APPLAUSE ]
AND BONUS FOLLOW-UP, DEREK.

19:12.018 --> 19:18.491
WHAT MONTH IS IT?
>> JUNE.
>> OOH.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.761
SORRY.
WE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED FEBRUARY,
MARCH, APRIL, OR MAY.

19:21.761 --> 19:28.568
BUT LET'S PUT 100 POINTS ON THE
BOARD FOR DEREK.
WHOEVER HAS THE MOST POINTS AT

19:28.568 --> 19:32.672
THE END WILL HAVE THAT NUMBER OF
STEM CELLS INJECTED INTO THEIR
BRAIN IN THE HOPES OF -- WHAT'S

19:32.672 --> 19:36.910
THE WORD?
THE THING YOU DO WITH CARS.
>> TIRES.

19:36.910 --> 19:42.949
>> NO.
WHEN THE BATTERY'S DEAD YOU'VE
GOT TO LIKE --

19:42.949 --> 19:46.286
>> SELL THE CAR.
>> NO.
IT -- WHAT YOU DO WITH THE

19:46.286 --> 19:51.725
CABLE.
>> WHEELBARROW?
>> NO.

19:51.725 --> 19:54.427
JUMPSTART.
YEAH.
THE STEM CELLS WILL JUMPSTART

19:54.427 --> 19:59.065
YOUR BRAIN AGAIN.
DAMMIT, WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
>> YOU'RE DEPRESSED.

19:59.065 --> 20:03.370
>> NO, NO.
I WASN'T REALLY ASKING.
>> YOU NEVER FELT MORE ALONE?

20:03.370 --> 20:06.706
>> STOP GUESSING.
>> YOU WANT TO CALL YOUR
THERAPIST BUT SHE BLOCKED YOUR

20:06.706 --> 20:10.477
NUMBER.
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
>> YOU JUST GIVE OFF THAT EXACT

20:10.477 --> 20:12.679
AURA.
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GIVE DEREK 100 MORE

20:12.679 --> 20:16.783
POINTS.
GREAT.
WHICH MEANS HE'S UNLOCKED A

20:16.783 --> 20:25.191
BONUS QUESTION THAT INVOLVES A
MYSTERY GUEST.
DEREK, WHO IS THIS?

20:25.191 --> 20:27.560
>> OH, THAT'S EASY.
THAT'S ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS
FROM COLLEGE.

20:27.560 --> 20:32.632
>> UH-HUH.
AND WHAT'S HIS NAME?
>> HE WAS ONE OF MY BEST

20:32.632 --> 20:37.637
FRIENDS.
>> YOU SAID THAT.
BUT WHAT'S HIS NAME?

20:37.637 --> 20:43.343
>> I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING REGULAR
LIKE GREG OR -- STEVE, RIGHT?
>> WE LIVED TOGETHER FOR THREE

20:43.343 --> 20:50.283
YEARS, MAN.
>> OOH.
SORRY, DEREK.

20:50.283 --> 20:53.987
THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS DEREK.
>> WE'VE GOT THE SAME NAME?
[ LAUGHTER ]

20:53.987 --> 20:57.857
>> THAT WAS OUR WHOLE THING,
MAN.
D-1, D-2.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.927
>> DAMN, THAT'S REALLY BAD, MAN.
I'M SORRY.
WE SHOULD GRAB A DRINK OR

21:00.927 --> 21:07.434
SOMETHING SOMETIME AND CATCH UP.
>> UH-OH.
THE SOUND OF SOMEONE INVITING A

21:07.434 --> 21:13.073
FRIEND TO DRINKS WHEN THEY HAVE
NO INTENTION OF EVER GETTING
DRINKS MEANS WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

21:13.073 --> 21:14.841
SO LET'S GO TO THE FINAL
QUESTION TO DETERMINE IF YOUR
BRAIN IS OKAY.

21:14.841 --> 21:18.978
CONTESTANTS, WRITE DOWN YOUR
ANSWERS, PLEASE.
IF YOU HAD TO TALK TO A PERSON,

21:18.978 --> 21:24.284
IF YOU HAD TO TALK TO A PERSON,
WHAT'S A GOOD WAY TO START?
AND GO.

21:32.125 --> 21:32.859
**

21:32.859 --> 21:37.097
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SEE YOUR IDEA OF HOW TO
START A CONVERSATION.

21:37.097 --> 21:40.633
JENNIFER, I NOTICED YOU WROTE
WITH YOUR TONGUE.
>> WELL, THERE'S STILL ONE

21:40.633 --> 21:47.007
VARIANT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN.
>> OKAY.
JENNIFER SAID, "LET ME BE INSIDE

21:47.007 --> 21:54.114
YOU, NOW."
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND JENNIFER, WHO DO YOU IMAGINE

21:54.114 --> 21:57.250
SAYING THAT TO?
>> ANYONE FROM STRANGERS TO
PARENTS.

21:57.250 --> 22:00.387
>> OKAY.
SORRY.
THAT'S INCORRECT.

22:00.387 --> 22:04.224
YOUR BRAIN IS NOT OKAY.
VICTOR, HOW WOULD YOU START A
CONVERSATION?

22:04.224 --> 22:07.060
LET'S SEE.
"HEAVEN MUST BE MISSING AN ANGEL
BECAUSE WHEN I WOKE UP THERE WAS

22:07.060 --> 22:10.930
A GLOWING FIGURE HOVERING OVER
MY BED.
I GUESS IT COULD HAVE BEEN A

22:10.930 --> 22:16.636
GHOST.
I'M WORRIED I'M LOSING MY GRIP
ON REALITY.

22:16.636 --> 22:21.641
HA-HA-HA."
>> YES, I'VE GIVEN THE GHOST A
NAME.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.710
BLUEBAR.
>> OKAY, WELL THAT'S VERY
INCORRECT.

22:23.710 --> 22:29.649
YOUR BRAIN IS ALSO BAD.
>> WHEN YOU TALK, ALL I PICTURE
IS THE SKELETON INSIDE YOUR

22:29.649 --> 22:34.421
HEAD.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WELL, MAMA.

22:34.421 --> 22:38.792
OKAY.
DEREK, IT'S DOWN TO YOU.
AND YOU WROTE, "IF YOU SET THE

22:38.792 --> 22:43.096
CLOCK AHEAD YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
ALIVE AS LONG."
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

22:43.096 --> 22:49.235
YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> OH, MY GOD, I WON?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

22:49.235 --> 22:52.806
YOU CAME UP WITH A GREAT WAY TO
MINIMIZE THE TIME WE'RE AWAKE
AND ALIVE.

22:52.806 --> 22:59.112
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR PRIZE.
A TWO-WEEK ALL-INCLUSIVE TRIP TO
HAWAII OR YOU CAN GO BACK TO

22:59.112 --> 23:06.286
YOUR APARTMENT AND STAY THERE.
>> APARTMENT.
>> THEY ALWAYS SAY APARTMENT.

23:06.286 --> 23:09.889
THANKS FOR WATCHING "IS MY BRAIN
OKAY?"
IF YOU'VE GOT TO ASK, IT'S

23:09.889 --> 23:13.560
PROBABLY NOT.
GOOD NIGHT.

>>> THESE DAYS WHEN I SIT DOWN
TO WATCH A MOVIE, I CAN FIND

23:23.737 --> 23:28.241

"SEX AND THE CITY 2" WAS 2 HOURS

25:59.159 --> 26:05.365
AND 26 MINUTES LONG.
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, THE
MOVIE "JURASSIC PARK" WAS TWO

26:05.365 --> 26:09.536
HOURS AND SEVEN MINUTES LONG.
THAT WAS A MOVIE THAT TOLD THE
HISTORY OF DINOSAURS, HOW DNA

26:09.536 --> 26:12.772
WORKS AND EXPLAINED THE SCIENCE
OF BRINGING DINOSAURS BACK TO
LIFE.

26:12.772 --> 26:16.710
AND "SEX AND THE CITY 2," YOU
KNOW, WHICH WAS A MOVIE ABOUT
FOUR WOMEN WE ALREADY KNEW, WAS

26:16.710 --> 26:22.749
20 MINUTES LONGER.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S BAD OR
ANYTHING.

THOSE MINUTES.

>> SURE LOOKS LIKE ONE TO ME.
THAT'S A 1970s RAINBOW BUSH.

SO MANY GREAT, SMART QUESTIONS.

45:01.401 --> 45:07.607
ARE BABIES RACIST?

PERIOD.
UNLESS YOU'RE OLD OR YOUNG.

RELEVANT TO A CONFIRMATION
HEARING?

IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
FOR A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

47:11.831 --> 47:16.036
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A

58:36.416 --> 58:45.658
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> YEAH, YEAH.
ANYWAY, I LOOKED OVER.

58:45.658 --> 58:48.161
WHO'S SITTING AT THE BAR WITH A
SLY GRIN ON HIS FACE?
>> THE FRENCH WAITER.

58:48.161 --> 58:50.296
>> NO.
>> OBAMA?
>> WHAT?

58:50.296 --> 58:53.500
NO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> OKAY, WAIT, WAIT.

58:53.500 --> 58:57.871
DON'T TELL ME IT WAS FRANK.
>> IT WAS FRANK.
>> OH, MY GOD, FRANK.

58:57.871 --> 59:02.042
>> THAT IS HILARIOUS.
>> FRANK?
WAIT.

59:02.042 --> 59:06.780
WHO'S FRANK?
>> HE'S JUST OUR FRIEND.
HE'S A BIT OF A PRANKSTER.

59:06.780 --> 59:10.383
>> WOW.
THAT IS -- I'VE NEVER HEARD
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

59:10.383 --> 59:12.118
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> YEAH.
KIND OF FUNNY.

59:12.118 --> 59:13.520
RIGHT?
ANYWAY, HOW ARE YOU GUYS?
HOW WAS MEXICO?

59:13.520 --> 59:17.490
>> OH, MY GOD.
IT WAS SO FUN --
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

59:17.490 --> 59:20.427
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> DID YOUR BOSS JUST WIG OUT?

59:20.427 --> 59:30.770
HE'S LIKE KNOCKING OVER THE
TABLE LIKE AH, EVERYONE'S FIRED!
>> NOPE.

59:30.770 --> 59:32.872
IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE END OF THE
STORY, MAN.
>> OH.

59:32.872 --> 59:34.774
BUT THE FRENCH WAITER WAS HIGH
ON DOPE, RIGHT?
[ LAUGHTER ]

59:34.774 --> 59:37.944
>> WHAT?
HIGH ON DOPE?
>> NO.

59:37.944 --> 59:40.180
EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL.
IT WAS JUST A DUMB STORY.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING

59:40.180 --> 59:42.849
ELSE?
>> OH.
SORRY.

59:42.849 --> 59:45.118
I THOUGHT THE FRENCH WAITER WAS
HIGH ON DOPE THE WHOLE TIME.
[ LAUGHTER ]

59:45.118 --> 59:50.957
STILL AMAZING.
>> THE PLACE WAS FRENCH.
NOT THE WAITER.

59:50.957 --> 59:55.328
I NEVER SAID THE WAITER WAS
FRENCH.
>> OH.

59:55.328 --> 59:59.432
SORRY.
>> IT'S FINE.
ANYWAY, YOU SAID MEXICO WAS

59:59.432 --> 1:00:02.235
GOOD?
>> SO GOOD.
YEAH.

1:00:02.235 --> 1:00:04.337
TURNS OUT YOGA RETREATS ARE
RELAXING.
WHO KNEW?

1:00:04.337 --> 1:00:07.941
>> DIDN'T MEAN TO CALL THE
WAITER FRENCH.
[ LAUGHTER ]

1:00:07.941 --> 1:00:10.543
MY BAD.
SORRY AGAIN.
>> ALL GOOD, DUDE.

1:00:10.543 --> 1:00:17.117
LET'S JUST DROP IT.
WE'RE MOVING ON.
>> WELL, BRADFORD HAD A GREAT

1:00:17.117 --> 1:00:23.156
TIME AT THE MET.
IT WAS SO COOL, RIGHT?
>> I REALLY DID LOVE THE STORY,

1:00:23.156 --> 1:00:25.191
MAN.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THANKS.

1:00:25.191 --> 1:00:28.495
I APPRECIATE THAT.
>> WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE
CRAZY BOSS AGAIN?

1:00:28.495 --> 1:00:34.200
WAS IT ANDERSON?
>> IT WAS ANTHONY.
WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT

1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:36.369
ANYMORE REALLY.
>> ANTHONY.
IT'S JUST LIKE THE PERFECT NAME

1:00:36.369 --> 1:00:39.072
FOR IT.
REALLY SORRY IF I SCREWED UP THE
STORY.

1:00:39.072 --> 1:00:43.510
>> BRADFORD.
IT'S FINE.
>> NO.

1:00:43.510 --> 1:00:50.650
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT.
BRIAN, YOUR STORY WAS AMAZING.
IT HAD GREAT CHARACTERS.

1:00:50.650 --> 1:00:56.056
AND THE PART WHERE THE CREPE
ISN'T CHEESE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
AND THEN I MESSED THE WHOLE

1:00:56.056 --> 1:01:01.361
THING UP.
I DON'T DESERVE TO BE YOUR
FRIEND.

1:01:01.361 --> 1:01:07.100
>> DUDE, WE JUST MET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
HONESTLY, IT'S FINE.

1:01:07.100 --> 1:01:10.704
>> NO, IT'S NOT.
LUNCH IS ON ME.
AND I WANT TO PAY YOUR RENT FOR

1:01:10.704 --> 1:01:13.473
THE REST OF THE YEAR, TOO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> WHAT?

1:01:13.473 --> 1:01:18.778
THAT'S SUPER GENEROUS, MAN.
>> HERE'S A CHECK FOR $1,000.
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

1:01:18.778 --> 1:01:21.181
>> THAT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH FOR
ONE MONTH'S RENT.
>> OH, OKAY.

1:01:21.181 --> 1:01:32.392
DIDN'T KNOW.
WELL, SEE YOU.
HEY.

1:01:32.392 --> 1:01:33.493
