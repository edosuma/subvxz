00:27.041 --> 00:29.464
On behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency,

00:29.838 --> 00:33.214
a grateful nation thanks you for your father's sacrifice.

00:34.195 --> 00:36.856
This star on the wall is in some ways

00:36.950 --> 00:38.563
too small a gesture.

00:39.404 --> 00:42.113
Bill Vaughn dedicated his life in service

00:42.345 --> 00:44.434
and commitment for his country.

00:44.994 --> 00:49.181
His death in the line of duty is a tragedy for his loving wife

00:49.227 --> 00:50.650
and his young son.

04:33.890 --> 04:34.739
Did you see the front page?

04:35.486 --> 04:35.981
Yeah.

04:36.635 --> 04:38.008
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

04:44.502 --> 04:46.401
So Laughton called me back from CIA archives.

04:47.193 --> 04:48.566
- About Nightingale?
- Yeah.

04:48.661 --> 04:50.033
- When?
- Yesterday morning.

04:50.172 --> 04:51.213
Why didn't you tell me?

04:52.146 --> 04:55.095
I was going to. He didn't find anything.

04:56.727 --> 04:57.814
We'll keep looking.

05:02.205 --> 05:03.198
I should get dressed.

05:08.242 --> 05:09.186
There could be a hundred reasons

05:09.278 --> 05:11.701
your father didn't register Nightingale with the CIA.

05:11.794 --> 05:12.691
Yeah, I know.

05:12.785 --> 05:14.349
Listen, have you seen my jacket anywhere?

05:14.488 --> 05:16.004
It's a setback, but

05:16.190 --> 05:17.849
there are people we can talk to.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.364
No, no, there aren't.

05:20.110 --> 05:21.436
Keys. Where the hell are my keys?

05:21.528 --> 05:24.142
We could bring it to A.P.O. They might be able to help us track --

05:24.188 --> 05:25.132
We're not bringing this to A.P.O.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.744
The last thing I want is Sloane knowing I was investigating my father's death

05:27.818 --> 05:29.097
and him using that against me.

05:29.236 --> 05:30.609
We don't know your father's dead.

05:32.169 --> 05:34.355
Yeah. At this point, I do.

05:34.448 --> 05:36.061
After all the progress you've made, how can you just --

05:36.153 --> 05:38.623
How can I just what? What have I got?

05:38.716 --> 05:41.044
Some journals in his handwriting that shouldn't even exist?

05:41.230 --> 05:43.798
And a word. One word. Nightingale.

05:43.889 --> 05:45.740
What the hell does that even mean?

05:45.926 --> 05:47.347
Some random woman mentioned it to me.

05:47.393 --> 05:50.198
I would have been better off asking for the goose that lays golden eggs.

05:50.292 --> 05:53.430
It wasn't some random woman. She was the woman who raised Nadia.

05:54.363 --> 05:56.692
I want to get to the bottom of this as badly as you do.

05:56.784 --> 06:00.829
We always thought my mother killed your father, but what if we were wrong?

06:00.969 --> 06:02.582
What if there was some other plan?

06:08.514 --> 06:10.509
- Do you have a minute?
- Certainly.

06:10.693 --> 06:12.020
I need to ask you a favor.

06:13.466 --> 06:16.319
I was wondering if I could use your level six clearance

06:16.598 --> 06:17.876
to look at some files.

06:18.734 --> 06:21.001
In reference to what?

06:21.514 --> 06:23.938
They're not for me. They're --

06:24.263 --> 06:26.352
It's for Vaughn, actually.

06:26.444 --> 06:27.485
I see.

06:29.586 --> 06:34.441
A month ago, Vaughn found a journal that belonged to his father.

06:35.048 --> 06:37.853
The entries ended in 1982.

06:37.993 --> 06:40.844
Mom killed bill Vaughn in '79,

06:40.983 --> 06:42.550
but we authenticated the handwriting.

06:42.641 --> 06:44.157
That proves nothing.

06:44.437 --> 06:47.528
Counterfeit artists are experts at graphoanalysis.

06:47.621 --> 06:50.188
I know, but it doesn't explain Nightingale.

06:50.748 --> 06:52.839
- What's Nightingale?
- We don't know.

06:52.930 --> 06:56.071
Vaughn followed a lead in the journal that took him to a woman in Lisbon

06:56.209 --> 06:57.631
who knew all about Vaughn's dad --

06:57.771 --> 07:00.051
that he rescued Nadia when she was a baby.

07:00.189 --> 07:01.659
She said that shortly after that

07:02.124 --> 07:04.547
he left looking for Nightingale.

07:04.780 --> 07:08.110
It could be a code name, it could be an operation.

07:08.622 --> 07:10.282
I know I'm asking for a lot.

07:13.178 --> 07:15.697
But I understand what Vaughn's going through.

07:15.976 --> 07:18.398
You also know how dangerous that search can be.

07:19.379 --> 07:20.800
Yeah, I do.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.246
Thank you.

07:36.180 --> 07:38.556
I appreciate you trusting me with this.

07:41.264 --> 07:43.068
It seems like we haven't really talked since --

07:43.159 --> 07:44.009
Mom died.

07:46.718 --> 07:49.331
Feel free to come to me anytime.

08:30.094 --> 08:31.534
Looks like you have an audience.

08:32.514 --> 08:33.169
Not bad.

08:34.712 --> 08:37.755
Nightingale is the brainchild of Dr. Josef Vlachko,

08:37.849 --> 08:40.366
russian émigré we recruited into D.A.R.P.A.

08:40.460 --> 08:44.458
He vanished 25 years ago after running tests on human subjects.

08:44.504 --> 08:45.256
Nice guy.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.103
When he left,

08:46.195 --> 08:48.475
he took all the records of project Nightingale with him.

08:48.707 --> 08:50.748
That's  why you couldn't find anything.

08:50.935 --> 08:53.405
D.A.R.P.A. had to cover up the security breach.

08:53.590 --> 08:55.012
So if we find Vlachko,

08:55.433 --> 08:57.188
we might find something on my dad.

08:59.148 --> 09:01.762
Hans Dietrich, german money launderer.

09:02.089 --> 09:05.017
Last year he started branching out into higher-risk investments,

09:05.112 --> 09:06.961
mainly new weapons systems.

09:07.054 --> 09:08.570
He funneled over a million euros

09:08.663 --> 09:11.849
into an encrypted bank account labeled "Nachtigall" --

09:12.128 --> 09:13.072
Nightingale.

09:14.986 --> 09:17.268
Dietrich's  office is located in Munich.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.448
He runs a beer hall on the ground floor.

09:19.588 --> 09:22.440
If we can get to his records, we might be able to find a lead --

09:22.533 --> 09:24.908
something on Vlachko. Who knows?

09:25.889 --> 09:27.072
Syd, how'd you get all this?

09:28.472 --> 09:30.256
- My dad.
- What?

09:30.348 --> 09:32.534
- He has clearance --
- Did you tell him everything?

09:32.766 --> 09:34.043
I had to.

09:40.630 --> 09:42.243
How much do they know?

09:42.970 --> 09:44.467
Uncertain.

09:45.261 --> 09:47.921
Apparently there were journals we couldn't account for.

09:48.668 --> 09:51.759
Hmm. Well, this should shut them down.

09:51.898 --> 09:53.320
We could turn this to our advantage.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.264
Let sydney and Vaughn obtain intelligence for us.

09:58.459 --> 09:59.451
I see.

10:01.085 --> 10:03.317
And you have no problem with that?

10:03.643 --> 10:05.159
Of course I do.

10:05.812 --> 10:08.999
But given our current obstacles,

10:09.092 --> 10:11.802
they might provide a lead we couldn't get on our own.

10:13.950 --> 10:16.660
All right, Jack. Give them a long leash.

10:17.639 --> 10:19.300
But just so we're clear,

10:20.466 --> 10:22.413
we cannot afford to be compromised,

10:23.299 --> 10:25.677
not even by your daughter.

10:25.768 --> 10:27.332
It won't come to that.

11:08.954 --> 11:10.328
No, I'm fine, thanks. Don't help.

11:10.467 --> 11:11.840
Ah, boo-hoo.

11:12.074 --> 11:14.020
"I'm gonna go up north and drink wine for two days

11:14.113 --> 11:15.868
while my friends stay here and work."

11:16.100 --> 11:18.381
It's called accumulated vacation, man. You use it or lose it.

11:18.475 --> 11:20.753
So you'll water the plants, and you'll send out --

11:20.845 --> 11:22.505
Sydney, go. Have a good time.

11:22.644 --> 11:24.734
You know what? We could actually drive up and meet you guys.

11:25.339 --> 11:26.808
- We're busy.
- Yeah.

11:26.902 --> 11:28.085
You got to eat. One meal.

11:28.170 --> 11:29.880
Yeah, that's what room service is for.

11:29.970 --> 11:31.490
Don't mind him. Have fun.

11:31.670 --> 11:34.820
We're crazy this weekend anyway. We got plans.

11:35.004 --> 11:37.666
You know, we're doing the, um, there's that, uh...

11:37.712 --> 11:38.418
Yeah.

12:00.890 --> 12:01.690
That's Dietrich.

12:02.951 --> 12:04.419
He's with his bodyguards.

12:04.979 --> 12:07.785
On the right is Dietrich's second-in-command, Carl Goedde.

12:09.278 --> 12:10.556
This'll be fun.

12:10.649 --> 12:13.196
No toys from Marshall. Cell phones instead of comms.

12:13.289 --> 12:15.903
Yeah. Now all we have to do is get Dietrich alone,

12:15.997 --> 12:18.277
convince him to show us his files on Nightingale.

12:21.126 --> 12:22.358
I can get him alone.

12:46.331 --> 12:46.847
Ja.

13:01.323 --> 13:01.745
Yeah?

13:01.791 --> 13:03.357
They're getting the check. They're almost out the door.

13:03.496 --> 13:05.090
Okay, okay, I'm almost there.

13:43.058 --> 13:43.764
Olga.

13:45.771 --> 13:46.621
Komm mit mir.

13:52.066 --> 13:52.882
Yeah?

13:52.975 --> 13:53.899
Hey, man, quick question.

13:53.993 --> 13:55.176
Eric, this is a really bad time.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.689
Where are you? Is that a party?

13:56.830 --> 13:57.964
Look, I'm gonna have to call you back.

13:58.057 --> 13:59.812
Romantic getaway's going that good, huh?

14:00.138 --> 14:02.608
Braids, fishnets. It's pretty spectacular.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.170
Somebody's getting lucky tonight.

14:04.729 --> 14:05.626
Bye!

14:38.514 --> 14:39.887
Where do you keep your financial records?

14:39.980 --> 14:41.257
- What?
- Your business files.

14:41.351 --> 14:42.103
Where do you keep them?

14:42.242 --> 14:44.571
God! On my computer!

14:44.663 --> 14:45.703
Show me, or I'll break your neck.

14:45.795 --> 14:46.644
I will.

14:51.783 --> 14:53.932
Please don't hurt me.

15:09.396 --> 15:11.485
The guys down here are getting pretty antsy.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.458
- How you doing?
- Give me 30 seconds.

15:20.808 --> 15:24.712
Uh, Mr. Goedde? Enacio Maldini, Europol liaison, organized crime unit.

15:24.945 --> 15:26.031
We've received complaints --

15:26.124 --> 15:27.640
Don't tell me. Take it up with our lawyers.

15:27.780 --> 15:32.017
We have, and unless you want my entire office down here tomorrow, you'll listen to me.

15:51.145 --> 15:53.855
Low wages, no overtime, rampant sexual harassment.

15:53.947 --> 15:55.607
What? Sexual harassment?

16:07.849 --> 16:08.744
Auf wiedersehen.

16:19.583 --> 16:20.670
Okay, try it now.

16:25.295 --> 16:26.048
It's there.

16:26.234 --> 16:27.941
It's encrypted. It's gonna take a while.

16:28.079 --> 16:29.215
Yeah, well, as long as it's in there.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.103
Hello?

16:35.290 --> 16:37.332
- Say it's Weiss.
- What?

16:37.423 --> 16:41.279
Tell your girlfriend that it's Weiss if you want to know about your father.

16:42.585 --> 16:43.243
Weiss.

16:45.439 --> 16:46.765
You got lucky in Munich,

16:47.136 --> 16:49.321
but Nightingale won't answer your questions.

16:49.414 --> 16:50.406
Only I can.

16:51.339 --> 16:55.529
Sherwood library. UCLA campus. Get there in an hour.

16:55.620 --> 16:58.806
The library will be closed, but the side door will be open.

16:59.413 --> 17:01.837
Yeah, you know what? I'll see if I can.

17:01.929 --> 17:03.780
What I have is for you alone.

17:03.873 --> 17:05.180
If you tell your girlfriend,

17:05.506 --> 17:07.787
she'll be dead by the time you get back.

17:10.448 --> 17:11.915
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

17:13.131 --> 17:14.074
What's going on?

17:14.446 --> 17:17.443
Um, nothing. He just wanted to grab a burger.

17:17.627 --> 17:19.431
You should go. I'll work on this.

17:19.554 --> 17:21.548
Besides, if Weiss gets suspicious...

17:21.641 --> 17:22.920
Yeah, yeah, okay.

17:29.602 --> 17:30.403
You want anything?

17:30.496 --> 17:31.917
No, thanks, I'll grab something later.

17:32.056 --> 17:32.905
All right. I won't be long.

17:34.448 --> 17:35.247
Take your time.

17:36.929 --> 17:37.872
Tell Weiss I said hi.

17:38.806 --> 17:39.321
I will.

18:01.076 --> 18:02.021
Yeah?

18:02.252 --> 18:05.630
"Through the looking glass." The illustrated edition.

18:41.983 --> 18:43.357
You've got to be kidding me.

18:48.496 --> 18:51.348
Listen, if you think I'm gonna inject myself, you're out of your mind.

18:51.441 --> 18:53.626
If I wanted you dead, I'd kill you right now.

18:53.998 --> 18:55.324
You want to know about your father?

18:55.416 --> 18:57.745
I give you two minutes to do the right thing.

19:58.259 --> 20:01.254
I traced Sydney and Vaughn's movement. They went to Munich.

20:01.627 --> 20:02.810
What did they find?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.181
Undetermined at this point.

20:04.368 --> 20:07.364
Jack, the plan was to let Sydney and Vaughn open doors

20:07.455 --> 20:10.575
that we couldn't go through and to pull them back if they got too far.

20:11.322 --> 20:13.554
I don't see much here in the way of containment.

20:13.648 --> 20:14.830
We have an option.

20:15.483 --> 20:17.477
I can go to Sydney, engender her trust,

20:17.570 --> 20:19.611
convince her to bring the case to A.P.O.

20:20.921 --> 20:23.248
Hmm. No, she's too intuitive.

20:23.994 --> 20:25.559
Considering your relationship,

20:26.352 --> 20:29.538
she'll see right through you, through us.

20:29.584 --> 20:30.386
No, she won't.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.432
I know exactly how to approach her.

20:46.087 --> 20:47.777
- Hello?
- It's me.

20:48.430 --> 20:49.470
Dad, hi.

20:49.562 --> 20:52.606
I realize this is short notice, but

20:53.026 --> 20:56.165
I was wondering if you'd join me at Miceli's this evening.

20:57.846 --> 20:58.694
Um...

20:59.441 --> 21:00.576
Is it bad timing?

21:00.669 --> 21:01.518
No. I --

21:01.611 --> 21:04.846
Hey, I was just hoping you might be free for dinner.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.134
I'll meet you there in 30 minutes.

21:08.649 --> 21:09.641
See you there.

21:51.229 --> 21:52.172
Mr. Vaughn.

21:58.105 --> 21:59.098
Welcome back.

22:02.181 --> 22:02.792
Don't worry.

22:02.836 --> 22:03.685
It's temporary.

22:04.042 --> 22:07.657
The paralysis should wear off in about 4 minutes, 20 seconds.

22:08.574 --> 22:10.998
Might sting a little, though. You know, the re-entry.

22:12.632 --> 22:13.718
Who are you?

22:14.324 --> 22:16.796
A man that could tell you about your father.

22:17.495 --> 22:18.582
But first what I want.

22:19.002 --> 22:22.427
That intel you stole from Dietrich will lead you to Nightingale.

22:22.847 --> 22:26.272
What I'm interested in is the transforming coil inside Nightingale.

22:27.487 --> 22:29.225
Are you out of your mind?

22:31.328 --> 22:34.421
I'm not the one who injected myself with an unknown substance.

22:35.820 --> 22:38.532
So now that we've established your desperation,

22:38.607 --> 22:40.696
it's a matter of how far you're willing to go.

22:43.451 --> 22:45.494
Why should I believe anything you say?

22:45.866 --> 22:46.906
Phillip Burke.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.933
B-U-R-K-E.

22:52.428 --> 22:53.420
Who's that?

22:55.803 --> 22:56.699
You look him up.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.246
And when you're done, you contact me.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.920
One time only.

23:03.694 --> 23:04.687
Make it count.

23:32.976 --> 23:33.740
Thanks for coming.

23:36.261 --> 23:38.923
I took the liberty of ordering a bottle of pinot noir.

23:39.436 --> 23:39.999
Okay.

23:46.727 --> 23:49.484
- You look very nice.
- Thank you.

23:50.325 --> 23:51.108
So...

23:52.414 --> 23:53.025
Yes.

23:53.818 --> 23:54.905
Everything okay?

23:56.727 --> 23:57.339
It's fine.

23:59.019 --> 24:01.061
How's your investigation going? Vaughn's father?

24:03.070 --> 24:04.395
It's complicated, actually.

24:05.095 --> 24:05.896
You found something?

24:07.998 --> 24:10.660
The  intel on the hard drive makes it seem like

24:10.799 --> 24:13.128
Nightingale is an active project.

24:13.221 --> 24:13.878
Active?

24:13.971 --> 24:17.397
Vlachko was running it out of an abandoned nuclear reactor in Siberia.

24:18.312 --> 24:20.689
He's jerry-rigged enough nuclear power to drive what he needs.

24:20.735 --> 24:21.393
For what purpose?

24:21.439 --> 24:24.533
I'm not sure exactly, but the experiments are molecular.

24:24.671 --> 24:27.668
They're altering human DNA.

24:28.602 --> 24:31.121
There was a list of over a dozen human test subjects.

24:31.213 --> 24:32.491
All of them died.

24:32.630 --> 24:35.150
There's mention of the genetic markers AD9,

24:35.242 --> 24:37.284
but I don't know what it all means.

24:41.723 --> 24:43.478
Sydney, you have to bring this to A.P.O.

24:43.572 --> 24:44.564
Not until I talk to Vaughn.

24:44.703 --> 24:47.365
Vaughn doesn't know that people may be dying because of it.

24:49.141 --> 24:51.563
I gave you level six clearance because I trusted you.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.364
I'm asking you to trust me now.

24:54.764 --> 24:56.234
Bring this to A.P.O.

24:56.886 --> 25:01.027
If you really want to find answers, use the resources A.P.O. can provide.

25:04.812 --> 25:08.237
You have to discuss this with Vaughn first. I respect that.

25:08.564 --> 25:10.320
But the longer you keep this off-book,

25:10.644 --> 25:12.764
the worse this will look for both of you.

25:12.857 --> 25:17.046
The only way to proceed is honestly, above board.

25:18.803 --> 25:21.178
Promise me you'll tell Vaughn that.

25:24.541 --> 25:25.438
I promise.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.511
- She told you this?
- Yes.

25:31.212 --> 25:31.822
Hmm.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.330
For 20 years, Josef Vlachko has been off the grid.

25:35.656 --> 25:38.032
Now we find him through Sydney, of all people.

25:40.863 --> 25:42.762
Well, I have to hand it to you, Jack.

25:43.069 --> 25:47.164
I never thought that you would be capable of exploiting your own daughter.

25:48.285 --> 25:49.850
I certainly couldn't do that.

25:50.503 --> 25:54.406
I could have a strike team on the ground in Siberia in 72 hours.

25:54.591 --> 25:56.539
That's a foolish course of action.

25:57.941 --> 26:00.268
Vlachko's our strongest lead to Yelena Derevko.

26:00.903 --> 26:02.994
With this intel, we need to act quickly.

26:03.086 --> 26:05.272
Sydney cannot know that I've betrayed her confidence.

26:05.317 --> 26:07.455
We wait for her to bring this in.

26:09.744 --> 26:10.975
And if she doesn't?

26:11.068 --> 26:12.823
She will. I asked her to.

26:13.852 --> 26:18.662
When she does, we'll draw up an ops plan requiring me to go along on the mission.

26:19.344 --> 26:19.954
Once there,

26:20.326 --> 26:23.609
I'll interrogate Vlachko without Sydney or Vaughn knowing.

26:23.888 --> 26:27.074
If our assumption is correct, Vlachko is communicating with Yelena.

26:28.288 --> 26:31.619
Once you've completed the interrogation, he needs to be eliminated.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.917
That's a little extreme, don't you think?

26:35.009 --> 26:37.672
No, I consider it a necessary precaution.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.319
He could alert Yelena to our agenda,

26:41.019 --> 26:42.488
or even worse,

26:42.908 --> 26:44.568
he could talk to Sydney,

26:44.753 --> 26:46.892
which would be a disaster.

26:47.264 --> 26:48.686
Unless, of course,

26:49.339 --> 26:52.432
you want to destroy everything we've worked for.

27:08.726 --> 27:12.796
"Phillip Burke killed in Laos. 10/21/79."

27:16.440 --> 27:17.290
They're identical.

27:17.569 --> 27:18.703
His name's Phillip Burke.

27:19.029 --> 27:22.980
CIA black ops agent killed in Laos the exact same date my father was killed.

27:23.447 --> 27:26.871
The autopsy reports show that Burke was shot with a Makarov pistol,

27:26.964 --> 27:29.675
the exact same make and model your mother used to kill my father.

27:30.374 --> 27:31.272
And there's more.

27:32.158 --> 27:34.058
Dental records.

27:34.478 --> 27:37.522
The ones on the left are Burke's, the set on the right are my father's.

27:38.876 --> 27:39.917
Oh, my god.

27:40.010 --> 27:41.669
I mean, we've always thought your mother killed my father,

27:41.716 --> 27:44.091
but what if she killed Phillip Burke instead?

27:47.083 --> 27:48.885
How would the CIA -- how would anyone --

27:48.978 --> 27:51.498
Maybe the CIA didn't know, and someone wanted the world to think Bill Vaughn died

27:51.543 --> 27:53.490
and replaced him with Phillip Burke.

27:58.631 --> 28:00.987
Vaughn, where did you get this information?

28:01.594 --> 28:02.968
That phone call from before --

28:03.014 --> 28:04.293
it wasn't Weiss.

28:04.386 --> 28:05.904
I went to see a guy named Roberts.

28:05.995 --> 28:08.657
I made a deal with him because he said he had information about my father.

28:11.508 --> 28:12.787
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.777
Syd, he said he'd only talk if I came alone.

28:14.851 --> 28:16.274
I don't care. What you did was crazy.

28:16.365 --> 28:17.455
Yeah, and it paid off.

28:17.546 --> 28:18.779
This guy knows more, and he'll tell me.

28:18.871 --> 28:20.007
In return for what?

28:20.099 --> 28:22.476
He wants me to give him Nightingale. Some transformer coil.

28:22.568 --> 28:25.328
We don't even know what Nightingale is yet, and you want to just hand it over?

28:25.421 --> 28:26.461
We're just gonna shut down the testing.

28:26.508 --> 28:27.977
We're not gonna hand over the entire program.

28:28.069 --> 28:30.351
Just a part of it. Syd, we do missions like this all the time.

28:30.397 --> 28:32.247
Not on our own. Not rogue.

28:34.396 --> 28:36.918
My father wants us to bring this in to A.P.O.

28:38.272 --> 28:39.741
You talked to him again.

28:40.253 --> 28:43.774
Your father and Sloane will never let me keep technology like this for myself.

28:43.915 --> 28:45.558
And besides, I don't trust them.

28:45.650 --> 28:47.071
I don't trust anybody --

28:47.211 --> 28:48.204
except you.

28:48.671 --> 28:50.186
Then what do you suggest?

28:51.073 --> 28:53.212
We come clean with A.P.O. like your father wants,

28:53.350 --> 28:54.963
we drop a mission that'll get us Nightingale,

28:55.103 --> 28:57.050
and then we run a countermission.

28:57.188 --> 28:58.323
Like the old days.

28:58.417 --> 29:00.124
Our stated goal is to retrieve the coil.

29:00.216 --> 29:01.734
But instead we keep it for ourselves.

29:01.965 --> 29:04.055
The only problem is, there's no way we can make a duplicate.

29:04.148 --> 29:05.999
We won't have time to make a fake one.

29:06.093 --> 29:07.276
So we have a plan "B."

29:12.695 --> 29:15.072
We need to retrieve the coil and shut down Nightingale.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.779
Assuming you enter the facility undetected, what then?

29:17.871 --> 29:19.800
Once inside, Vaughn and I will split up.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.700
I'll recover the coil while Vaughn takes care of security.

29:23.024 --> 29:25.400
Now, each door in the facility is key-code operated,

29:25.541 --> 29:27.820
but Vlachko operates out of the security station here.

29:27.913 --> 29:29.143
So I'll subdue him.

29:29.312 --> 29:30.828
I'll override all the locking mechanisms.

29:30.921 --> 29:33.155
That should get Sydney into the control room where the coil's held.

29:33.246 --> 29:35.242
What configuration did you say the reactor was running?

29:35.334 --> 29:35.992
RBMK.

29:36.038 --> 29:38.271
Then you'll need two people to retrieve the coil --

29:38.457 --> 29:41.072
one to ensure the reactor stays in standby mode

29:41.119 --> 29:43.590
while the other enters the test chamber to grab the coil.

29:43.636 --> 29:45.344
Yeah. That's right.

29:45.483 --> 29:48.336
That means you're missing one man to override security.

29:48.430 --> 29:49.707
Then I'll join the team.

29:49.801 --> 29:50.507
As third man,

29:50.598 --> 29:53.405
I'll access the security system while you and Vaughn recover the coil.

29:53.964 --> 29:56.961
Once the mission is complete, we can bring Vlachko back for questioning.

29:57.007 --> 29:59.239
If we need a third man, Dixon is more than capable.

29:59.332 --> 30:01.804
Actually, Jack's experience will serve you well --

30:02.598 --> 30:05.450
unless there's something about this mission that you haven't told me.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.290
No, sounds good.

30:30.842 --> 30:32.216
Home plate, we're in.

30:32.355 --> 30:34.303
Copy, five by five, Phoenix. Standing by.

31:05.006 --> 31:06.047
I'm going to the security room.

31:06.139 --> 31:07.370
We'll meet you back here with the coil.

31:30.792 --> 31:33.597
The more you cooperate, the less pain you'll endure.

31:35.279 --> 31:36.032
Sit down.

31:37.433 --> 31:38.377
Sit down!

31:42.396 --> 31:43.291
Shutting down security.

31:44.085 --> 31:45.507
Jack, are you with Dr. Vlachko?

31:45.739 --> 31:46.874
Yes, he's been subdued.

31:48.697 --> 31:52.265
Shotgun, Phoenix, unlocking the door to the control room now.

31:52.358 --> 31:53.446
Copy. Almost there.

32:01.465 --> 32:02.934
Okay, Marshall, we're at the control panels.

32:03.027 --> 32:04.258
Is the reactor online?

32:04.398 --> 32:06.487
Negative. We can see the transformer inside now.

32:06.626 --> 32:08.381
All right, open up the containment shield.

32:08.521 --> 32:09.655
That's where the coil is.

32:09.888 --> 32:10.499
Copy.

32:21.294 --> 32:22.954
Now release the lock to the test chamber.

32:30.243 --> 32:32.191
We've got the chamber open. I'm going in.

32:37.425 --> 32:39.324
Dismantling the pressure shield now.

32:43.624 --> 32:45.045
This will take a couple minutes.

32:46.588 --> 32:48.916
I need information, and I need it very quickly.

32:49.009 --> 32:50.526
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:53.936 --> 32:55.024
I know about Nightingale.

32:58.443 --> 33:02.449
If you know about Nightingale, what else can I possibly tell you?

33:02.588 --> 33:04.440
The location of Yelena Derevko.

33:05.559 --> 33:06.504
Yelena?

33:07.017 --> 33:09.977
- Tell me where she is.
- I don't know.

33:14.143 --> 33:16.340
Ready to remove the coil.

33:20.919 --> 33:21.816
Where's Yelena?

33:21.909 --> 33:23.284
I told you, I don't know.

33:23.422 --> 33:25.132
You worked for her. You've been in contact.

33:25.223 --> 33:26.933
You couldn't have set this up without her help.

33:27.444 --> 33:28.483
That was years ago.

33:28.716 --> 33:30.138
I don't have time for this.

33:55.108 --> 33:55.718
Vaughn.

33:56.325 --> 33:57.509
Syd, the controls are fried.

33:57.928 --> 33:58.922
Can you get me out of here?

33:59.106 --> 34:01.384
- Tell me where she is.
- I don't know!

34:01.478 --> 34:04.429
Home base, the reactor's coming online. It's coming online now.

34:04.521 --> 34:06.135
Vaughn, bypass the nuclear fusion switch.

34:06.181 --> 34:07.747
It's on the panel under the main controls.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.395
I have to run a bypass.

34:33.194 --> 34:34.980
Okay, is there an ethernet port next to the motherboard?

34:36.288 --> 34:36.755
Yeah.

34:36.989 --> 34:37.792
Okay, plug it in there.

34:38.818 --> 34:40.956
That should give me access to...

34:41.777 --> 34:43.152
All right, nice. That did it.

34:44.646 --> 34:45.543
I'm on their server.

34:46.570 --> 34:49.040
Vaughn, fuse the blue and yellow wire together to open the door.

34:51.284 --> 34:52.418
Syd, try the door now.

34:53.304 --> 34:54.344
It's still locked.

34:55.886 --> 34:56.592
Vaughn!

34:56.824 --> 34:58.199
Marshall, I can't bypass the door.

34:58.291 --> 34:59.570
Sydney is in the room with the reactor.

34:59.850 --> 35:01.557
Is there another way to shut down the core?

35:01.651 --> 35:03.071
Only if you remove the fuel rods.

35:08.352 --> 35:10.012
Marshall, I'm headed toward the core.

35:10.106 --> 35:11.335
No, no, no, do not do that.

35:11.428 --> 35:13.567
Exposure to that amount of radiation could kill you, okay?

35:13.659 --> 35:14.604
I can slow down the countdown,

35:14.696 --> 35:16.117
buy enough time to corrupt the reactor mainframe.

35:16.211 --> 35:17.107
Just give me some time.

35:21.931 --> 35:22.618
Take cover.

35:39.145 --> 35:40.949
No, Mr. Bristow, I see what you're doing. Don't go in there.

35:41.463 --> 35:43.933
I've almost got it. I can keep the reactor from coming online. I can.

35:44.306 --> 35:46.301
It's getting a little warm in here.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.005
Hang on, I'm working on it.

35:58.715 --> 35:59.612
Marshall, come on.

35:59.939 --> 36:02.001
Okay, almost there, almost there, almost there.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.515
Got it. The countdown's slowing down.

36:15.455 --> 36:21.298
Work some magic, work some magic, work some magic, work some magic, ...

36:39.637 --> 36:40.630
Marshall, what just happened?

36:40.816 --> 36:42.907
Total system shutdown due to core corruption.

36:45.804 --> 36:46.508
I did it.

36:49.872 --> 36:50.912
We did it. We --

36:52.266 --> 36:54.310
All right, Marshall, Marshall, just free Sydney, would you?

36:54.401 --> 36:55.967
Oh, right, sorry. System's in reset.

36:56.013 --> 36:59.057
That shouldn't be a problem and free at last.

37:00.925 --> 37:01.728
Sydney.

37:05.186 --> 37:07.746
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

37:08.494 --> 37:09.583
"Plan B."

37:10.470 --> 37:11.414
I hate this.

37:11.787 --> 37:12.538
Vaughn.

37:14.969 --> 37:15.819
Are you sure?

37:24.416 --> 37:25.218
I love you.

37:26.273 --> 37:28.106
Yeah? Still?

37:40.023 --> 37:41.158
Remember what you promised?

37:42.932 --> 37:44.069
I'll let you know when I get there.

37:44.722 --> 37:45.524
Okay.

37:54.359 --> 37:55.111
Sydney.

37:58.896 --> 38:00.126
I couldn't stop him.

38:05.641 --> 38:07.588
It was Vaughn. He took the coil.

38:08.756 --> 38:10.131
I couldn't stop him, dad.

38:27.004 --> 38:28.711
Well, I don't understand this.

38:28.851 --> 38:32.040
Vaughn assaulted Sydney and stole the coil?

38:32.319 --> 38:33.121
Yes.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.095
And you believe her?

38:36.963 --> 38:39.149
Vaughn wouldn't go against us without a reason.

38:40.082 --> 38:43.079
From his father's journals to this rash action,

38:43.265 --> 38:45.117
someone must be feeding him information.

38:45.211 --> 38:47.062
A third party we're not aware of.

38:47.154 --> 38:50.006
Yeah, well, obviously this complicates our situation.

38:50.146 --> 38:53.430
Yes, I imagine this might bequite upsetting for you, Arvin.

38:54.270 --> 38:59.175
My not anticipating Sydney and Vaughn's deceit could be greater than your own.

39:00.858 --> 39:03.616
Have you thought about how we're going to deal with this?

39:10.953 --> 39:11.706
Jack?

39:12.501 --> 39:13.158
Hmm?

39:13.718 --> 39:14.711
Are you all right?

39:15.176 --> 39:15.930
Fine.

39:16.629 --> 39:17.192
Just tired.

39:19.202 --> 39:22.388
I'll work up some options retrieving Vaughn and the coil.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.139
Uh, Mr. Bristow? Mr. Bristow?

40:08.231 --> 40:11.611
Hi. Listen, I ran the diagnostics on the core reactor shutdown.

40:11.657 --> 40:14.128
- Remember, Marshall saves the day?
- Marshall, this is not the time.

40:14.269 --> 40:15.738
Well, but I re-ran security protocols,

40:15.784 --> 40:17.540
and I checked them and rechecked them twice, believe me,

40:17.586 --> 40:19.152
because I couldn't quite understand --

40:19.245 --> 40:19.950
Marshall, what is it?!

40:20.043 --> 40:21.370
I didn't shut down that reactor at all.

40:21.464 --> 40:22.742
- That's impossible.
- No, it isn't.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.113
The printouts -- Listen, it is physically impossible for me

40:25.208 --> 40:26.819
to shut down that reactor from a remote location.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.284
I mean, given its particular status,

40:28.424 --> 40:29.655
it would have to be shut down manually.

40:29.748 --> 40:33.173
But that's impossible, too, because that would mean that someone -- that --

40:36.677 --> 40:37.574
I mean, you.

40:39.723 --> 40:44.200
The only way it could happen is if you went in the reactor yourself.

40:49.994 --> 40:52.370
It was my daughter's life.

40:58.212 --> 41:01.209
Between us.

41:05.412 --> 41:09.209
