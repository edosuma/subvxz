00:11.098 --> 00:12.360
[exhales]

00:35.122 --> 00:37.385
A CRANE COLLAPSED
IN DOWNTOWN TRENTON.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.039
DON'T CARE.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.088
THAT'S MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER.

00:45.132 --> 00:48.004
NO, IT'S JUST A BOOK
HE WROTE.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.137
OPEN IT UP.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.838
SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE GIVING
THIS TO US?

00:55.881 --> 00:57.448
IT'S A BIG STEP
YOU'RE TAKING.

00:57.492 --> 00:58.884
I WANTED
TO CONGRATULATE YOU.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.365
I UNDERSTAND THAT'S
THE ADULT THING TO DO.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.758
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

01:02.801 --> 01:04.107
I'VE KNOWN FOR A WHILE.

01:04.151 --> 01:06.501
THE FACT THAT YOU DECIDED
TO COHABITATE

01:06.544 --> 01:08.590
IS NOT EXACTLY A SPOILER.

01:08.633 --> 01:11.114
UNLESS MY INTEL IS WRONG.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.463
TROUBLE IN PARADISE?

01:12.507 --> 01:15.249
WE HAVE TO GET
TO TRENTON.

01:17.164 --> 01:20.906

02:49.473 --> 02:50.866
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

02:50.909 --> 02:52.172
HMM?

02:52.215 --> 02:54.261
THAT SOUND LIKE A YES?

02:54.304 --> 02:56.350
SIR, WE HAVE TO GET YOU
TO THE O.R.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.221
YOU HAVE A BAD WOUND,
BUT WE'RE GONNA PACK IT

02:58.265 --> 03:00.397
AND TRANSPORT YOU
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

03:01.311 --> 03:04.184
SKULL FRACTURE.
GLASGOW COMA SCORE OF 11.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.273
SHE'S IMMEDIATE.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.535
MOVE ON.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.450
THIS GUY'S DEAD.
HIS WOUNDS AREN'T SO--

03:09.493 --> 03:11.016
FORGET THE WOUND.
LOOK AT HIS TOES.

03:11.060 --> 03:15.195
ATHEROSCLEROTIC EMBOLI.
HE'LL NEVER SURVIVE THE SURGERY.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.458
MAYBE HIS SHOES
WERE TOO TIGHT.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.329
IT'S NOT THE SHOES.
SKIN SHOWS SMOKER'S FACIES.

03:19.373 --> 03:20.461
HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT
TILL MORNING.

03:20.504 --> 03:21.984
HE'LL JUST TAKE UP
AN AMBULANCE RIDE,

03:22.027 --> 03:25.292
SURGEON'S TIME,
AND AN ICU BED.

03:25.335 --> 03:29.600
HE'S EXPECTANT.
LEAVE HIM.

[man]
I ONLY NODDED OFF FOR A SECOND.

03:32.603 --> 03:35.389
I LOST CONTROL OF THE LOAD.
I'M SO SORRY.

03:35.432 --> 03:37.347
DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU OUTTA HERE.

03:37.391 --> 03:38.827
I'M SORRY.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.045

03:40.089 --> 03:41.264
READY?
THREE, TWO, ONE.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.266
[man groaning]

03:43.310 --> 03:45.312
THAT'S IT.

03:45.355 --> 03:48.619
CRANE OPERATOR.
MADE IT THROUGH AMAZINGLY WELL.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.753
LUCID AND RESPONSIVE.
STABLE FRACTURE, RIGHT HUMERUS.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.581
HAVEN'T GOTTEN
TO HIS LOWER HALF YET.

03:53.624 --> 03:54.930
TELL ME
WHEN SOMETHING HURTS.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.454
I FELL ASLEEP.
KILLED ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

03:57.498 --> 04:00.936
SOMETHING OTHER THAN
YOUR CONSCIENCE.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.461
IS THAT A PILL IN YOUR POCKET,
OR ARE YOU JUST...

04:04.505 --> 04:07.290
HAPPY TO HAVE A
TINY PILL-SHAPED PENIS?

04:08.900 --> 04:10.293
CAFFEINE PILLS.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.947
YOU FELL ASLEEP
TAKING THESE?

04:11.990 --> 04:13.862
I DRANK TWO CUPS
OF COFFEE TOO.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.342
IS THAT NORMAL FOR YOU?

04:15.385 --> 04:17.300
NO, I HATE COFFEE.
I'M WORKING ON NO SLEEP.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.519
MY DAUGHTER HAS THE FLU.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.608
THIS MUCH CAFFEINE
FOR A COFFEE VIRGIN.

04:20.651 --> 04:23.524
THERE'S NO WAY HE FELL ASLEEP.
HE PASSED OUT.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.830
WHICH MEANS
A NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER

04:25.874 --> 04:27.397
CAUSED THE CRASH,
NOT FATIGUE.

04:27.441 --> 04:30.487
HEY.

04:30.531 --> 04:33.142
WE'RE TAKING THE CRANE
OPERATOR BACK TO PRINCETON.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.013
THEY SAID HE WAS BARELY
HURT--HE CAN WAIT.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.406
STEAL AN AMBULANCE.
AND CALL THE TEAM.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.712
TELL 'EM WE GOT A CASE.

04:37.755 --> 04:40.845
HOUSE. NO!
I NEED YOU HERE.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.544
AND HE NEEDS ME THERE.
AND HE MOANS LOUDER THAN YOU DO.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.502
THERE WERE OVER 100 PEOPLE
IN THAT BUILDING.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.199
ONLY 76 HAVE BEEN
ACCOUNTED FOR.

04:47.243 --> 04:51.508
FOREMAN AND YOUR TEAM CAN HANDLE
THE CRANE OPERATOR FOR NOW.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.614
[cell phone ringing]

05:12.616 --> 05:13.530
HAVING FUN DOWN THERE?

05:13.574 --> 05:14.749
[House]
LOTS!

05:14.792 --> 05:17.534
EVERY TIME CUDDY
LEANS OVER A PATIENT,

05:17.578 --> 05:21.277
IT'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
FOR A DOWN BLOUSE NIP SLIP.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.497
WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN HER AND LUCAS?

05:23.540 --> 05:24.933
BESIDES THEM MOVING IN
TOGETHER?

05:24.976 --> 05:26.282
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

05:26.326 --> 05:29.372
I GAVE HER
THE HOUSEWARMING GIFT EARLIER.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.896
AND SHE PAUSED
FOR A SPLIT SECOND,

05:31.940 --> 05:33.768
LIKE SHE WAS HIDING SOMETHING.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.465
IT'S PROBABLY
HER MORAL REVULSION

05:35.509 --> 05:36.727
AT HOUSEWARMING GIFTS.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.512
OR MAYBE SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO ACCEPT A GIFT

05:38.555 --> 05:40.340
FOR SOMETHING
SHE WASN'T GONNA DO.

05:40.383 --> 05:44.387
YOU ACTUALLY THINK
THEY'RE NOT MOVING IN TOGETHER?

05:44.431 --> 05:47.434
WHAT WAS THAT?
YOU OKAY?

05:47.477 --> 05:50.219
YEP. VENDING MACHINE
COLLAPSED.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.917
SHE STILL USING
YOUR EX-WIFE AS A REALTOR?

05:52.961 --> 05:54.441
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

05:54.484 --> 05:55.877
WELL, KNOW A LITTLE
FARTHER, WILL YOU?

05:55.920 --> 05:58.227

IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,

06:40.878 --> 06:43.141
TAP THREE TIMES,
OR CALL OUT.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.190
IS ANYONE THERE?

06:50.540 --> 06:52.020
I'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.196
I HEARD SOMETHING. THERE'S
GOTTA BE A VOID DOWN THERE.

06:54.239 --> 06:55.502
THERE'S A MILLION VOIDS
DOWN THERE.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.025
IT WAS THE PARKING GARAGE.

09:34.051 --> 09:36.793

AT THE FRAMERS.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.621
IT'S ON ELM.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.057
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD ME EARLIER.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.711
I COULD HAVE PICKED IT UP
ON THE WAY.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.061
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

09:44.105 --> 09:45.497
IT'S A PICTURE
FROM OUR TORTOLA TRIP.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.977
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.197
I'M NOT ASKING YOUR NAME
BECAUSE I WANNA BECOME FRIENDS.

I'M TRYING TO GAUGE
YOUR MENTAL STATE.

09:58.815 --> 09:59.860
[Hanna]

09:59.903 --> 10:02.123
BETTER STILL.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.733
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:03.777 --> 10:07.389
YOU KNOW THAT GIANT
CONSTRUCTION CRANE NEXT DOOR?

10:07.432 --> 10:10.566
IT'S KIND OF

OKAY, I'M GONNA TRY

10:26.843 --> 10:28.584
NO, STAY!
SOMEONE ELSE WILL COME.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.934
NO ONE KNOWS I'M DOWN HERE.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.110
PLEASE!
STAY WITH ME.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.909
WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO START A DIFFERENTIAL.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.562
PERFECT!
LET'S START RIGHT NOW.

10:50.606 --> 10:51.912
PUT ME ON SPEAKER.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.742
[shouting over drilling]
WHAT CAUSES SYNCOPE?

10:55.785 --> 10:57.744
YOUR GUY'S STABLE.
THE TWO DOZEN OTHER PATIENTS--

10:57.787 --> 10:59.180
DON'T NEED
TO BE DIAGNOSED.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.095
THEY JUST NEED
TO BE BANDAGED.

11:01.138 --> 11:04.185
WHAT CAUSES SYNCOPE?

11:04.228 --> 11:05.229
VASOVAGAL REACTION...

11:05.273 --> 11:07.188
MENINGIOMA.
SICK SINUS SYNDROME.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.625
[Taub]
OR YOU'RE WRONG,
AND HE JUST FELL ASLEEP.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.497
HOW'S HE GONNA SLEEP
WITH 50 CUPS OF COFFEE
GOING THROUGH HIS VEINS?

11:12.541 --> 11:13.716
WERE YOU NEVER
A MEDICAL RESIDENT?

11:13.760 --> 11:15.979
I HEAR TEN, ELEVEN,
AND TWELVE.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.589
WHERE'S THIRTEEN?SHE'S NOT HERE.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.461
AND THE ANSWER TO YOUR
NEXT QUESTION IS NO.

11:19.504 --> 11:20.897
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.725
DO YOU HAVE THE ANSWER
TO MY QUESTION AFTER THAT?

11:22.769 --> 11:25.685
SPACE-OCCUPYING LESION
IN HIS BRAIN IS MOST LIKELY.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.121
MRI WILL PROVE I'M RIGHT.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.296
OR IT'LL JUST PROVE

11:28.339 --> 11:29.732
HE SUFFERED HEAD TRAUMA
FROM THE CRASH.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.255
WHICH
WE'D WANNA FIND ANYWAY.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.655
PALER?
NO, NO. SHE'S STABLE.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.961
THAT MEANS HER BLOOD
LOSS IN MINIMAL.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.484
BUYS US SOME TIME.

11:42.527 --> 11:43.920
GET THE I.V. INTO HER TIBIA.

11:43.964 --> 11:47.097
IT'S ALMOST HOLLOW,
FEEDS INTO THE VENOUS SYSTEM.

11:48.838 --> 11:52.450

TEACH YOU IN EMT SCHOOL.

THIRSTY.

HIGH COMPRESSION CONCRETE.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.000
I CAN'T BREAK IT UP.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.218
YOU CAN'T GET ME
OUTTA HERE?

12:21.262 --> 12:23.090
NAW. JUST MEANS
WE GOTTA MOVE ON

12:23.133 --> 12:24.744
TO A DIFFERENT PIECE
OF EQUIPMENT.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.963

12:34.449 --> 12:36.756
I'D LIKE SOMEBODY

12:36.799 --> 12:38.148
LOOK, THE GUY WHO JUST LEFT
IS THE ONE

12:38.192 --> 12:39.802
WHO'S GONNA BE HOLDING YOUR HAND
THROUGH ALL THIS.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.282
YOU TALK TO HIM.

12:41.325 --> 12:42.805

12:42.849 --> 12:44.720
AAH! OH!

12:46.853 --> 12:49.725
OH...OKAY. BIG PINCH.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.946
I GOTTA CALL MY HUSBAND.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.295
CAN I USE YOUR PHONE?

12:54.338 --> 12:56.123

13:18.928 --> 13:20.843
OF COURSE...

13:20.887 --> 13:22.497
IS NOW LATER?

13:23.498 --> 13:25.543
MAYBE THINGS AREN'T GOING
SO WELL WITH LUCAS.

13:25.587 --> 13:26.762
IF SO, I'M SORRY.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.981
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO STEP INTO ANYTHING.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.331
THERE'S NO PROBLEMS.
WE'RE DOING JUST GREAT.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.506
THANK YOU.

13:31.549 --> 13:34.726
SO WHY THE WEIRDNESS?

13:34.770 --> 13:36.990
CAN YOU HELP?

13:40.167 --> 13:41.385
WHEN I OPENED IT,

13:41.429 --> 13:44.867
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
A HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.739
I THOUGHT IT WAS
AN ENGAGEMENT PRESENT.

13:52.396 --> 13:55.269
IT JUST HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.100
NO WONDER YOU WANNA
HIDE THIS FROM ME...

14:00.143 --> 14:01.884
SINCE I'M SUCH
A DELICATE FLOWER.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.060
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.235
AND I'VE BEEN
SLIGHTLY DISTRACTED.

14:05.279 --> 14:06.933
WELL, THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE,

14:06.976 --> 14:08.325
'CEPT YOU'RE NOT
WEARING THE RING.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.371
SO...YOU ARE HIDING IT,

14:10.414 --> 14:12.373
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION--

14:12.416 --> 14:14.897
HOUSE...IT'S IN
MY OFFICE DRAWER

14:14.941 --> 14:16.899
BECAUSE I KNEW
I WAS COMING HERE.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.466
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

14:18.509 --> 14:21.121
THERE'S NO MYSTERY.

14:21.164 --> 14:24.864
I'M JUST GETTING MARRIED.

14:24.907 --> 14:27.040
EXCUSE ME.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.217
HOW MUCH LONGER?

14:30.260 --> 14:31.522
[Taub]
UH, LESS THAN A MINUTE.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.524
ARE YOU IN ANY PAIN?

14:33.568 --> 14:36.397
NOTHING NOW.
JUST A LITTLE CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.139
SHOULDN'T YOU BE TAKING CARE
OF THOSE OTHER PEOPLE,

14:39.182 --> 14:41.576
THE ONES THAT I HURT?

14:44.405 --> 14:46.886
[Chase]
EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT OKAY.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.154
MY NOSE IS BLEEDING.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.983
IT'S EXPECTED, GIVEN
THE TRAUMA YOU'VE SUSTAINED.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.811
THAT'S NOT EXPECTED.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.996
[McCreaney]
THE WAY THINGS FELL,
THIS SUPPORT BEAM

15:10.039 --> 15:11.998
IS NOW HOLDING UP
A GIANT PILE OF RUBBLE.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.827
WE CAN'T LIFT IT WITHOUT
JEOPARDIZING EVERYONE DOWN HERE.

15:15.871 --> 15:18.352
SO IT'S TIME TO DISCUSS
AMPUTATION.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.013
NO.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.492
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

15:28.536 --> 15:31.017
WE'VE BEEN DOWN HERE
ALMOST TWO HOURS.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.149
BY THE TIME
THEY CLEAR AWAY THE RUBBLE--

15:33.193 --> 15:35.108
WE ARE NOT CUTTING OFF
HER LEG.

15:35.151 --> 15:36.805
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUSH
THROUGH THIS

15:36.848 --> 15:39.460
JUST TO MAKE HIS JOB EASIER.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.331
YOU KIDDING ME?

15:41.375 --> 15:43.116
WE LEAVE THE LEG PINNED,
WE'RE RISKING CRUSH SYNDROME.

15:43.159 --> 15:45.770
[Hanna]
WHAT'S THAT?

15:45.814 --> 15:47.120
YOUR LEG ISN'T GETTING
ENOUGH CIRCULATION.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.078
THE LONGER IT'S PINNED
THE MORE THE MUSCLE DIES.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.645
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
LIKE A LIMP?

15:50.688 --> 15:52.995
[Cuddy]
DYING MUSCLES
RELEASE POISONS.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.779
WE FREE YOUR LEG,

15:54.823 --> 15:56.259
THE POISONS RUSH BACK
INTO YOUR SYSTEM.

15:56.303 --> 15:59.219
IT COULD STOP YOUR HEART.SO COULD CHEESEBURGERS.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.656
LET'S GET YOUR LAZY FRIENDS
TO START MOVING THAT PILE.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.571
SHE'S GOT TWO MORE HOURS
BEFORE CRUSH SYNDROME

16:03.614 --> 16:05.094
COULD POSSIBLY SET IN.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.835
WE'RE DIGGING UP THERE
BY HAND.

16:06.878 --> 16:09.055
I CAN'T GUARANTEE
I CAN GET 10 TONS OF DEBRIS

16:09.098 --> 16:12.101
PULLED OFF IN TWO HOURS.WELL, YOU NEED TO TRY.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.147
IT'S MY LEG.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.975
[McCreaney]
IT'S NOT JUST CRUSH SYNDROME
YOU GOTTA WORRY ABOUT, OKAY?

16:16.018 --> 16:17.628
THERE'S GAS LEAKS.
THERE'S FIRE.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.500
WE CAN NEVER RULE OUT
SECONDARY COLLAPSES,

16:19.543 --> 16:21.110
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
WE SHORE THIS THING UP.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.546
YOU THINK CHOPPING OFF
SOMEONE'S LIMB

16:22.590 --> 16:24.331
INSIDE A PILE
OF DIRTY ROCKS IS SAFE?

16:24.374 --> 16:26.028
SEPSIS, FAT EMBOLISM,
A HEMORRHAGE.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.725
THOSE RISKS ARE NOTHING
COMPARED TO THE RISK

16:27.769 --> 16:29.989
OF THIS THING
COMING DOWN AGAIN.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.251
CAPTAIN, HE'S A JERK.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.079
BUT IT'S WHAT
THE PATIENT WANTS.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.384
CAN WE PLEASE

16:34.428 --> 16:37.257
JUST GIVE IT
A COUPLE MORE HOURS?

16:40.390 --> 16:42.871
[softly]
YEAH.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.351
I GOTTA
GET UP TO TRIAGE.

16:48.094 --> 16:51.532
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.055
HOUSE.

16:53.099 --> 16:56.189
YOU DON'T NEED
TO THANK ME.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.321
JUST MAKES SENSE.

16:58.365 --> 17:01.107
JUST PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
LET THEM CUT OFF MY LEG.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.196
I PROMISE.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.241
DOES THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER?

17:05.285 --> 17:07.591
FOR SOME REASON,
IT DOES.

17:07.635 --> 17:10.203
[cell phone rings]

17:10.246 --> 17:12.640
YOUR PHONE IS WORKING
DOWN HERE.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.990
SWITCHED CARRIERS.
BETTER ROLLOVER MINUTES.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.165
TALK.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.775
[Foreman]
MRI WAS CLEAN, BUT AFTERWARDS,

17:17.819 --> 17:19.864
HE STARTED BLEEDING
OUT OF HIS EYES AND NOSE.

17:19.908 --> 17:22.084
SO THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
BEFORE THE COLLAPSE.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.869
UNLESS IT'S JUST CONJUNCTIVE
COAGULOPATHY FROM THE TRAUMA.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.958
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH--YOU DON'T
THINK HE WAS SICK BEFORE.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.308
WE GET IT!
YOU'RE WRONG.

17:28.351 --> 17:29.396
[Chase]
BRAIN INFECTION?

17:29.439 --> 17:31.050
SORRY I'M LATE.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.313
WHERE WERE YOU?PHYSICAL THERAPY.

17:33.356 --> 17:34.966
I LEFT MY PHONE
IN MY LOCKER.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.186
[Chase]
THE INFECTION CAUSES
NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS,

17:37.230 --> 17:38.883
GOES SYSTEMIC,
AND D.I.C. CAUSES THE BLEED.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.189
GOOD THEORY.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.712
EXCEPT FOR THE PART
THAT THERE'S NO FEVER.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.453
GET AN X-RAY VENOGRAM.

17:43.497 --> 17:45.325
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
A REASON FOR YOUR EXISTENCE.

17:45.368 --> 17:47.675
ALSO LOOK FOR
VENOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.285
WOULD HAVE SEEN IT
ON THE MRI.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.287
NOT IF YOU WERE TOO BUSY
NOT LOOKING FOR IT.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.333
WE SHOULD X-RAY
FOR A FACIAL FRACTURE FIRST.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.117
THIS COULD ALL BE
SIMPLE TRAUMA.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.423
JUST DO WHAT I TELL YOU.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.642
BE BACK IN TEN MINUTES.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.297
YOU'RE LEAVING?

18:01.341 --> 18:03.125
THERE'S A DOZEN PEOPLE HERE
WHO CAN SAVE YOU.

18:03.169 --> 18:06.085
I'M APPARENTLY THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SAVE THIS OTHER GUY.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.261

18:20.186 --> 18:22.188
SHE'S HAVING
A PANIC ATTACK,

18:22.231 --> 18:24.190
SHE CAN'T BREATHE, SHE'S GONNA
RIP OUT ALL HER I.V.s.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.669
SO CALM HER DOWN.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.193
SHE WANTS YOU.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.717
I'M FLATTERED.
GIVE HER OXYGEN.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.198
THEY WON'T LET O2
DOWN THERE.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.243

18:34.287 --> 18:36.376
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.160
SHE NEEDS YOU, HOUSE.

[Velcro ripping]

18:56.396 --> 18:58.093
YOU ONLY CAME BACK
BECAUSE I FREAKED OUT.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.268
RIGHT?

18:59.312 --> 19:00.574
OH, NO.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.184
I JUST REALIZED HOW...

19:02.228 --> 19:05.405
BIG AND SCARY THE WORLD IS,

19:05.448 --> 19:09.235
AND HOW COZY AND SAFE
THIS LITTLE PLACE IS.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.411

I'M SORRY I NEEDED YOU.

19:37.437 --> 19:40.440

THEY'RE HELPING ME.

19:45.271 --> 19:49.318
ARE YOU COMING?
[breathing hard]

19:49.362 --> 19:53.235
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.237
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.
I'M SO SORRY.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.413
SEE? THIS IS WHY
I LIED ABOUT THE PHONE.

19:57.457 --> 19:58.762
YOUR BP IS SPIKING,

19:58.806 --> 20:00.242
SO YOU'RE BLEEDING FASTER
FROM YOUR LEG WOUND.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.896
I'M GONNA HAVE
LESS TIME TO SAVE IT.

20:01.939 --> 20:03.158
HANG UP.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.379
OKAY. OKAY, THEY'RE
TELLING ME I HAVE TO GO.

20:07.641 --> 20:11.427
[whimpering]

20:11.471 --> 20:13.821
THAT WAS STUPID OF ME.

20:13.864 --> 20:16.563
IT WAS NICE.

20:16.606 --> 20:19.783
I DON'T SEE THAT
AS A CONTRADICTION.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.351
HE WAS ALREADY
ON HIS WAY.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.092
HE WAS IN BALTIMORE,

20:24.135 --> 20:26.703
AND THEY ALL SAW IT
ON THE NEWS.

20:26.747 --> 20:29.445
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE HURT?

20:29.489 --> 20:33.493
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT
NOT RAISING YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE?

20:36.452 --> 20:39.063
CAN I ASK
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR LEG?

20:39.107 --> 20:40.369

20:43.242 --> 20:45.809
YOU COULD HAVE
JUST SAID NO.

20:45.853 --> 20:48.682
I'LL REMEMBER THAT
FOR MY NEXT HUMAN CONTACT.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.427
WOULD YOU PRAY WITH ME?

20:54.470 --> 20:56.167
NO.

20:56.211 --> 20:59.258
I'M NOT IN THE HABIT
OF ENCOURAGING

I DON'T EITHER.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.449
PLEASE?

21:31.681 --> 21:34.205
I ALWAYS THOUGHT...

21:34.249 --> 21:36.120
IF I DID THE RIGHT THING,

21:36.164 --> 21:38.253
IF I TREATED PEOPLE RIGHT,

21:38.297 --> 21:42.431
THEN GOOD THINGS
WOULD HAPPEN TO ME.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.303
YOU THINK THAT'S HOW IT WORKS?

21:46.740 --> 21:50.178
I DIDN'T USED TO.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.615
THEN RECENTLY I TRIED...

NOW I DON'T KNOW.

24:32.079 --> 24:33.689
MAIN TUNNEL IS FINE.
A TEAM'S ON THE WAY.

24:33.733 --> 24:36.692
[McCreaney]
LIFT THIS UP.

24:36.736 --> 24:37.737
ONE, TWO--

24:37.780 --> 24:39.869
[groaning]

24:48.704 --> 24:50.663
KIT.
GIMME THE KIT.

24:50.706 --> 24:52.534
ALL RIGHT.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.667
NO BREATH SOUNDS
ON THE LEFT SIDE.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.103
TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX.

24:56.146 --> 24:59.715
OKAY, HANNA.
ONE OF YOUR LUNGS IS COLLAPSED.

24:59.759 --> 25:02.675
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO REINFLATE IT, OKAY?

25:08.855 --> 25:11.597
UH...[coughs]

25:11.640 --> 25:15.557
[wheezing]

25:15.601 --> 25:16.602
HEY.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.081
YOU BETTER GET BACK
UP TOP

25:18.125 --> 25:20.519
AND MAKE SURE YOU DIDN'T
NICK AN ARTERY.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.652
[Hanna breathing quickly]

25:27.743 --> 25:29.745
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.535
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.582
YOU'RE LUCKY
THIS ISN'T WORSE.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.629
YOU KNOW
WHO'S EVEN LUCKIER?

25:43.672 --> 25:45.456
YOU AND JUST ABOUT
EVERY OTHER HUMAN BEING

25:45.500 --> 25:48.024
[cell phone rings]WHO WASN'T DOWN THERE.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.591
WHAT DID THE VENOGRAM SAY?

25:49.635 --> 25:50.810
[Thirteen]
CLEAN.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.725
NOW THE GUY'S STARTING
TO SPIKE A FEVER.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.161
SUBARACHNOID BLEED.

25:54.204 --> 25:55.641
NO HEADACHES,
MENINGITIS?

25:55.684 --> 25:56.990
HE DIDN'T SAY
HIS NECK WAS SORE.

25:57.033 --> 25:58.600
THAT'S 'CAUSE EVERYTHING'S
SORE.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.647
HE JUST TOOK A 15-STORY
SWAN DIVE INTO CONCRETE.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.823
DO AN LP.
WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER
OTHER INFECTIONS.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.302
SO YOU'RE SUGGESTING
WE DO AN LP.

26:05.346 --> 26:06.695
I GUESS I AM.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.044
GENIUS.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.785
HEY, BAD NEWS.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.961
BECAUSE OF THE COLLAPSE,
WE CAN'T TRY THE AIRBAG AGAIN

26:12.005 --> 26:14.224
UNTIL WE GET EVERYTHING
OFF THE TOP.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.009
BE FIVE,
SIX HOURS AT LEAST.

26:16.052 --> 26:17.445
THEN WE HAVE TO AMPUTATE.

26:17.488 --> 26:18.751
NO.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.317
IT'S BEEN FOUR HOURS
ALREADY.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.885
IT USED TO BE A LONG SHOT.
NOW IT'S...CRAZY.

26:22.929 --> 26:25.714
CRUSH SYNDROME IS BASICALLY
A BUILDUP OF POTASSIUM.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.977
IF WE REMOVE POTASSIUM--
WE'RE ALREADY TREATING
WITH SODIUM BICARBONATE.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.762
BUT NOT WITH GLUCOSE
AND INSULIN.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.067
WE HAVE GLUCOSE IN THE KIT.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.765
THERE'S GOTTA BE A DIABETIC
HERE SOMEWHERE.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.201
YOU WANNA
DOSE THE INSULIN

26:34.244 --> 26:36.551
HERE
IN A NON-HOSPITAL SETTING?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.684
THAT IS INSANE!
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

26:38.727 --> 26:40.686
REALLY?
'CAUSE I THINK

26:40.729 --> 26:43.079
I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE
WHO KNOWS WHAT A LEG IS WORTH.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.647
AND FORTUNATELY, YOU'RE NOT
THE ONE WHO'S IN CHARGE--HE IS.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.562
AND HE KNOWS
THAT I'D TESTIFY AGAINST HIM

26:47.606 --> 26:49.651
IF HANNA SUED
FOR CUTTING OFF A LEG

26:49.695 --> 26:51.261
WITHOUT EXHAUSTING
EVERY OPTION.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.699
GIVE US A MINUTE?

26:56.397 --> 26:57.790
I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY,

26:57.833 --> 26:59.879
BUT PLEASE DON'T PUT
HER LIFE AT RISK

26:59.922 --> 27:01.228
JUST TO GET BACK AT ME.

27:02.490 --> 27:05.362
REALLY? WOW.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.321
SO THIS IS ALL ABOUT
YOU NOW.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.889
YOU TOOK HER SIDE
AGAINST ME

27:09.932 --> 27:11.586
RIGHT AFTER YOU HEARD
ABOUT MY ENGAGEMENT.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.935
YEAH. THAT MUST BE IT.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.807
IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE
A PATHETIC NARCISSIST.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.852
I DON'T LOVE YOU.

27:16.896 --> 27:19.812
SO JUST...ACCEPT IT

27:19.855 --> 27:20.943
AND MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE

27:20.987 --> 27:22.597
INSTEAD OF MAKING EVERYONE
MISERABLE.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.990
THAT'S GREAT.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.296
A LIFE LESSON FROM
A MIDDLE-AGED SINGLE MOM

27:26.340 --> 27:27.776
WHO'S DATING A MAN-CHILD.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.822
SCREW YOU.

27:29.865 --> 27:32.215
I'M SICK OF MAKING
EXCUSES FOR YOU.

27:32.259 --> 27:35.741
I'M SICK OF OTHER PEOPLE
HAVING TO TIPTOE AROUND YOU

27:35.784 --> 27:36.959
AND MAKE
THEIR OWN LIVES WORSE

27:37.003 --> 27:40.876
WHILE THEY TRY TO KEEP YOU
FROM COLLAPSING.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.705
I'M DONE.

27:43.749 --> 27:44.967
FANTASTIC.

27:45.011 --> 27:47.187
JUST STAY AWAY
FROM MY PATIENT.

27:48.231 --> 27:51.017
WHAT ARE YOU
CLINGING TO, HOUSE?

27:51.060 --> 27:53.802
YOU'RE GONNA RISK HER LIFE
JUST TO SAVE HER LEG?

27:53.846 --> 27:56.065
REALLY WORKED OUT WELL
FOR YOU, DIDN'T IT?

27:56.109 --> 27:57.719
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
IN YOUR LIFE, HONESTLY?

27:57.763 --> 27:59.678
TELL ME.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.027
I'M MOVING ON.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.985
WILSON IS MOVING ON.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.292
AND YOU...YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING, HOUSE.

28:05.335 --> 28:07.294
NOTHING.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.252
I'M GOING DOWN THERE,

28:09.296 --> 28:12.952
AND I'M GONNA CONVINCE HER
TO LET ME CUT HER LEG OFF.

28:12.995 --> 28:15.911
IF YOU HAVE ANY DECENCY LEFT,
YOU'LL JUST STAY OUT OF IT.

28:23.092 --> 28:25.791
NO.

28:25.834 --> 28:28.184
DR. HOUSE PROMISED.

28:28.228 --> 28:30.186
IF THERE WAS ANY OTHER WAY--

28:30.230 --> 28:32.188
IT DOESN'T HURT RIGHT NOW.

28:32.232 --> 28:34.234
I CAN WAIT.

28:36.889 --> 28:39.195
DR. HOUSE.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.894
TELL HER.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.246
HANNA...

28:48.770 --> 28:51.381
WE HAVE TO AMPUTATE
YOUR LEG.

28:51.425 --> 28:52.600
NO.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.994
YOU SAID...
THAT THERE WAS TIME.

28:55.037 --> 28:57.736
THERE WAS.
AND IT'S RUN OUT.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.783
NO.

29:01.827 --> 29:05.787
YOU ASKED ME
HOW I'D HURT MY LEG.

29:05.831 --> 29:10.705
I HAD A BLOOD CLOT,
AND THE MUSCLE WAS DYING.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.099
AND I HAD ALL THESE DOCTORS
TELLING ME I SHOULD AMPUTATE,

29:13.142 --> 29:15.841
AND I SAID NO,
AND THEY DID THIS...

29:15.884 --> 29:16.972
VERY RISKY OPERATION.

29:17.016 --> 29:19.279
I ALMOST DIED.

29:19.322 --> 29:20.933
BUT YOU SAVED YOUR LEG.

29:20.976 --> 29:22.848
[Hanna shivering]

29:22.891 --> 29:25.198
I WISH I HADN'T.

29:25.241 --> 29:28.897
THEY CUT OUT A CHUNK OF MUSCLE
ABOUT THE SIZE OF MY FIST,

29:28.941 --> 29:31.682
AND THEY LEFT ME
WITH THIS MUTILATED,

29:31.726 --> 29:34.816
USELESS THING.

29:34.860 --> 29:39.908
AND I'M IN PAIN...
EVERY DAY.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.389
IT CHANGED ME.

29:42.432 --> 29:45.914
MADE ME A HARDER PERSON,

29:45.958 --> 29:48.221
A WORSE PERSON.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.614
AND NOW...

29:50.658 --> 29:53.966
NOW I'M ALONE.

29:59.014 --> 30:02.148
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
LIKE ME.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.195
YOU GOT A HUSBAND
WHO LOVES YOU.

30:06.239 --> 30:09.242
YOU HAVE FRIENDS.
YOU CAN START A FAMILY.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.984
YOU HAVE A LIFE.

30:13.637 --> 30:17.511
AND THIS...
THIS IS JUST A LEG.

30:34.310 --> 30:37.618
OKAY.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.585
I GOT IT.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.900
I CAN'T PUT YOU OUT.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.771
IT COULD DEPRESS
YOUR RESPIRATION TOO MUCH.

31:00.815 --> 31:02.817
THIS SHOULD TAKE AWAY
SOME OF THE PAIN.

31:09.563 --> 31:11.478
WILL IT BE QUICK?

31:13.610 --> 31:17.005
I'LL USE A SCALPEL
TO SLICE THROUGH THE SKIN,

31:17.049 --> 31:19.573
MUSCLE, AND FAT.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.227
THAT SHOULD GO PRETTY FAST.

31:21.270 --> 31:22.968
THEN I'LL SWITCH OVER
TO THE ELECTRIC SAW

31:23.011 --> 31:24.360
WHEN I GET TO THE BONE.

31:24.404 --> 31:27.189
IT'S TWO BONES...
ABOUT AS THICK AS A BROOMSTICK.

31:27.233 --> 31:30.149
TAKES ABOUT AS LONG
TO GET THROUGH.

31:30.192 --> 31:33.152
I'M GONNA CUT AS CLOSE
TO THE CONCRETE AS I CAN,

31:33.195 --> 31:35.589
TO SAVE AS MUCH OF YOUR LIMB
AS POSSIBLE.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.591
THEN THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS
BACK AT THE HOSPITAL

31:37.634 --> 31:40.333
WILL CLEAN YOU UP, HAVE YOU
FITTED FOR A PROSTHETIC.

31:40.376 --> 31:43.771
YOU'LL BE RUNNING CIRCLES
AROUND ME IN NO TIME.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.729
[chuckling]

31:49.995 --> 31:52.562
HOW BAD WILL IT HURT?

31:54.042 --> 31:57.002
LIKE NOTHING
YOU'VE EVER FELT BEFORE.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.961
[groaning]

33:04.199 --> 33:07.202
AAH!

33:10.075 --> 33:13.687
[distant wailing]

33:48.113 --> 33:49.810
HANNA.

33:49.853 --> 33:51.420
OH...BABY.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.074
I'M SO SORRY.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.816
SHUT UP.YOU ALWAYS LOVED MY LEGS.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.905
BABY, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR LEG.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.863
BABY, I LOVE YOU.

33:59.907 --> 34:01.213
I LOVE YOU.

34:01.256 --> 34:02.866
I LOVE YOU.I LOVE YOU.

34:19.274 --> 34:22.843
[siren wailing]

34:37.162 --> 34:40.556
[cell phone rings]

34:40.600 --> 34:42.341
WHAT?

34:42.384 --> 34:43.603
[Foreman]
HE'S FALLEN INTO A COMA.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.300
LP WAS CLEAN, BUT...

34:45.344 --> 34:46.736
WHAT ARE HIS VITALS?

34:46.780 --> 34:48.303
EXCUSE ME, OFFICER.

34:48.347 --> 34:49.435
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, OFFICER?

34:49.478 --> 34:51.089
HOW LONG HAS THERE
BEEN A COP THERE?

34:51.132 --> 34:52.655
I DON'T KNOW.
TEN MINUTES.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.657
HE WAS BEING QUESTIONED
WHEN HE FELL INTO THE COMA.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.485
WAS ANYTHING ELSE
MAKING HIM NERVOUS

34:56.529 --> 34:58.705
OR WORRIED
BEFORE HIS OTHER SYMPTOMS?

34:58.748 --> 35:00.141
HE WAS CLAUSTROPHOBIC
RIGHT BEFORE THE BLEED

35:00.185 --> 35:01.795
AND BEFORE THE FEVER.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.840
WE TOLD HIM THAT HE PROBABLY
DID FALL ASLEEP.

35:03.884 --> 35:06.060
[House]
WAS HIS BP SPIKING?

35:06.104 --> 35:07.975
BUT THAT DIDN'T CAUSE
HIS FIRST SYMPTOM.

35:08.018 --> 35:10.847
YEAH, IT DID.
ALL THE CAFFEINE.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.414
WE THOUGHT THE PROBLEM
WAS IN HIS TOILET--

35:12.458 --> 35:14.112
BY THAT, OF COURSE,
I MEAN HIS HEAD.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.678
WHICH DISTRACTED US
FROM THE FACT

35:15.722 --> 35:17.898
THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN
JUST A CLOG IN HIS SEWER PIPE,

35:17.941 --> 35:20.466
AND BY THAT, OF COURSE,
I MEAN HIS SPINAL CORD.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.642
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
YOU GET THE IDEA.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.252
AN ARACHNOID CYST
ON HIS LOWER SPINE.

35:24.296 --> 35:25.645
THAT'S WHY WE MISSED IT.

35:25.688 --> 35:27.081
HE'S BEEN SITTING
TEN HOURS A DAY.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.865
SPIKED HIS SPINAL FLUID
PRESSURE.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.563
RUN A CT--[Hanna wheezing]

35:32.434 --> 35:35.437
BP'S 72 OVER 42.
[Charles]
HANNA?

35:35.481 --> 35:36.917
HANNA?I CAN'T BREATHE.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.962
I CAN'T BREATHE.

35:39.006 --> 35:41.530
[rapid wheezing]

35:41.574 --> 35:44.751
BILATERAL BREATH SOUNDS.
IT'S NOT ANOTHER PNEUMOTHORAX.

35:44.794 --> 35:47.841
NECK VEINS FLAT.
THERE'S NO TAMPONADE.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.408
[wheezing]

35:49.451 --> 35:51.192
DAMN IT.
I WAITED TOO LONG.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.325
HANNA, YOU'VE GOT
A CLOT IN YOUR LUNG.

35:53.368 --> 35:54.761
I'M GONNA FIX THIS.

35:54.804 --> 35:56.371
I.V. STREPTOKINASE.

35:56.415 --> 35:59.157
WHAT'S HAPPENING.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:59.200 --> 36:01.594
HER BODY WON'T GET ANY OXYGEN
UNLESS WE CAN BUST THE CLOT.

36:01.637 --> 36:04.205
THIS IS A BLOOD THINNER.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.252
[grunts]

36:07.295 --> 36:08.905
IS SHE GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT?

36:08.949 --> 36:12.909
IT'S GONNA MAKE HER BLEED MORE.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT NEXT.

36:12.953 --> 36:16.304
[continues wheezing]

36:16.348 --> 36:19.568
IT'S NOT BUSTING THE CLOT.

36:19.612 --> 36:21.962
MAYBE IT'S HER HEART.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.457
WHAT?

36:38.500 --> 36:41.373
IT'S NOT A CLOT.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.331
IT'S A FAT EMBOLISM.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.899
FROM THE AMPUTATION.

36:49.511 --> 36:53.123
OKAY. SO--SO WHAT
CAN WE DO?

36:55.038 --> 36:56.126
COME ON.

36:58.346 --> 37:00.392
DO SOMETHING.
PLEASE, PLEASE, DO SOMETHING.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.307
COME ON, GUYS, DO SOMETHING.
COME ON.

37:02.350 --> 37:05.135
COME ON. PLEASE, COME ON,
DO SOMETHING!

37:05.179 --> 37:07.312
COME ON, DO SOMETHING!
DO SOMETHING!

37:17.626 --> 37:20.368
[flatline tone]

37:39.213 --> 37:41.476
THERE'S NO WAY TO PREVENT
A FAT EMBOLISM.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.565
EVEN IF YOU'D DONE THIS
IN AN O.R.,

37:43.609 --> 37:46.438
COULDN'T HAVE SAVED HER.

38:00.452 --> 38:03.324
YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF
FOR HER DEATH.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.760
THIS WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

38:04.804 --> 38:06.284
[shouting]
THAT'S THE POINT!

38:06.327 --> 38:09.112
I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.
SHE DIED ANYWAY.

38:09.156 --> 38:12.942
WHY THE HELL DO YOU THINK THAT
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL ANY BETTER?

38:22.604 --> 38:24.650
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
ALONE RIGHT NOW.
