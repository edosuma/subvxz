00:01.302 --> 00:03.071
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:03.104 --> 00:06.407
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.776
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.809 --> 00:10.578
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.611 --> 00:12.346
are members of an elite squad

00:12.380 --> 00:14.248
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.016
These are their stories.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.153
When we get home,

00:19.187 --> 00:20.554
Mommy's going to fix you
a nice piece of toast.

00:20.588 --> 00:21.655
Would you like that?

00:21.689 --> 00:24.192
Yes, you would.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.359
Oh, good doggie.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.362
I think I'll just
leave that right there.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.098
No one's even going to notice.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.400
Come on,
we're going home now.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.636
( barking )
Tootsie,
come back here.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.639
Where are you go--...
Tootsie!

00:38.672 --> 00:40.108
Oh, you bad doggie.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.409
You know you're not
supposed to dig

00:41.442 --> 00:43.377
in other
people's garbage.
( barks )

00:43.411 --> 00:45.646
Is that a fur coat?

00:45.679 --> 00:47.548
Oh, yes it is.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.783
Why would anyone

00:49.817 --> 00:51.419
throw away...?

00:57.225 --> 00:58.526
Oh, no...

00:58.559 --> 01:00.761
Tootsie, get away.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.564
Get away from her right now!

01:03.597 --> 01:05.799
( siren blaring )

01:07.335 --> 01:10.171
Victim's Livia Tellez,
23, from Queens.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.572
Found her naked,
pocketbook in the trash,

01:11.605 --> 01:13.341
money and cards
still in it.

01:13.374 --> 01:13.874
Find her clothes?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.309
Just wearing
the fur.

01:15.343 --> 01:18.179
Old bat wants it
when you're done.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.647
BENSON:
What's the story?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.682
Hasn't been dead more
than 12 hours.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.784
No stab or gunshot wounds.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.553
You can see the trauma

01:25.586 --> 01:27.255
to the left side of her face
and torso.

01:27.288 --> 01:27.855
Beat her to death.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.257
Rape kit?

01:29.290 --> 01:31.325
Positive for fluids.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.127
She was moved
postmortem, too.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.329
Lividity looks like
she died on her back,

01:35.363 --> 01:36.230
but she was on her side

01:36.264 --> 01:37.265
when they found her.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.366
Sounds like a dump job.

01:38.399 --> 01:41.169
Question: why here?

01:41.202 --> 01:43.171
She's got a boyfriend
in the neighborhood.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.738
He starts
smacking her around.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.207
She grabs the coat
and tries to leave.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.708
STABLER:
Or she's
a high-priced call girl.

01:47.741 --> 01:48.842
John's got some fantasy
of her

01:48.876 --> 01:50.478
showing up wearing
nothing but the coat.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.779
Only this time,
the john's a psycho.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.281
I'm guessing
whatever she was,

01:53.314 --> 01:54.748
she said something
she shouldn't have.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.284
How do you
figure that?

01:56.317 --> 01:58.386
Guy cut out her tongue.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.554
I don't see it around here.

02:00.588 --> 02:01.922
You might want to check out
that dog.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.691
Tootsie was such a big help.
Weren't you?

02:54.975 --> 02:56.444
Dug up the tenant application.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.512
I didn't know her,
but she seemed nice.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.613
Pretty... pretty girl.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.449
How long Ms. Tellez
live here?

03:01.482 --> 03:02.616
Little more than two years.

03:02.650 --> 03:03.917
No problems,
paid on time.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.553
I don't see
any references

03:05.586 --> 03:06.854
or previous addresses.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.989
Same with half the people
in this building.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.258
I figured she was illegal,

03:10.291 --> 03:13.594
but then I say, "Hey, this whole
country was founded by illegals

03:13.627 --> 03:14.595
so who am I to judge?"

03:14.628 --> 03:16.230
Where is she from?

03:16.264 --> 03:17.331
Puerto Rico maybe,
or Mexico.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.732
I can't tell.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.967
You say
she lived here two years?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.469
This place doesn't look
very homey.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.936
MAN:
Wasn't home much.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.638
Probably had
a boyfriend,

03:24.672 --> 03:26.274
but I never saw anybody.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.975
Look, I got
a leaky pipe to look at.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.643
We'll let ourselves out.

03:29.677 --> 03:30.644
Okay, you live
like a monk.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.645
How come somebody

03:31.679 --> 03:32.646
wouldn't have any pictures

03:32.680 --> 03:33.781
or knickknacks around?

03:33.814 --> 03:35.249
Some of us
appreciate simplicity.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.350
Others of us lost
the knickknacks

03:36.384 --> 03:37.385
in the divorce
settlement.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.419
Look at this.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.787
An airplane ticket stub
from Miami,

03:39.820 --> 03:41.021
dated the day she died...

03:41.054 --> 03:43.891
This is where
she spent all her money.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.793
Dolce & Gabbana, Versace...

03:45.826 --> 03:48.962
Gotta be 50 grand
worth of ho gear here.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.931
The hooker pays taxes:
social security card.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.400
She's not illegal.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.036
STABLER:
TRW and Equifax
both show no activity

03:56.069 --> 03:57.738
on that social
prior June 2001.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.274
No bank accounts,
no student loans, no jobs.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.475
All of her credit cards

04:01.509 --> 04:03.844
were issued around
the same time also.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.778
DMV says that Livia Tellez

04:04.812 --> 04:06.947
was issued a New York State
driver's license

04:06.980 --> 04:08.716
same month, same year.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.651
No prior driving record
in any other state.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.320
And nobody knew anything
about this girl?

04:12.353 --> 04:14.355
Neighbors were
just passing acquaintances.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.923
Vital statistics doesn't have
anything on her

04:15.956 --> 04:17.658
or any living relatives.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.360
We can rule out
identity theft.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.528
Can't steal an identity

04:20.561 --> 04:22.029
that didn't exist till
a couple of years ago.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.531
BENSON:
Everything that we've found

04:23.564 --> 04:25.633
says that Livia Tellez
just appeared out of nowhere.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.401
What about
witness protection?

04:27.435 --> 04:29.002
We checked.
She's not one of theirs.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.672
Feel free to express
your derision and ridicule,

04:31.705 --> 04:33.374
but I'm gonna say it:
spook.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.608
I'm not ridiculing.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.510
We probably got spies
from every country

04:36.544 --> 04:37.578
all over this city.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.780
Before we call in the CIA,

04:39.813 --> 04:40.848
let's see if the body can shed
some light

04:40.881 --> 04:42.015
on who this girl
really was.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.621
WARNER:
Tox screen came back positive
for cocaine.

04:47.655 --> 04:48.856
She have any tattoos,

04:48.889 --> 04:50.324
anything that could help us
identify her?

04:50.358 --> 04:52.326
No prominent scarring
or birthmarks.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.762
But I did find this
tangled in her hair.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.531
The chain was broken,
I imagine during the attack.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.500
No prints on it
other than her own.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.903
Madonna and child,
but I don't recognize
the image.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.071
STABLER:
That's a woman

05:04.104 --> 05:05.038
with a halo
holding a baby.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.106
My mother
had ten of them.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.641
So she's
a Catholic Latina.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.842
That'll narrow it down.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.744
Other than the face
and torso wound,

05:10.778 --> 05:12.413
there's a scrape on her leg.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.915
I found slivers
of fiberglass in it.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.049
Well, that doesn't
match anything CSU

05:16.083 --> 05:17.518
found at the dump site.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.586
Maybe it happened
where she was attacked.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.488
WARNER:
Maybe this will help you
with the location.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.757
Lab said they found
a powdery substance

05:23.791 --> 05:24.892
embedded in the fur.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.960
I asked them to send it over--

05:26.994 --> 05:29.062
I wanted to test
my theory.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.364
Cobalt thiocyanate.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.705
Cocaine?

05:37.738 --> 05:40.674
She was covered in it.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.744
That much coke,
could be a dealer.

05:43.777 --> 05:44.845
Maybe in a room
wearing that fur

05:44.878 --> 05:45.813
when they were
cutting the base.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.881
Well, she wasn't living
the life of a dealer.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.950
No drugs, no money,
no assets were found
in her apartment.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.051
Call girl still works

05:51.084 --> 05:52.920
if she was helping
the dealer distribute.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.588
Explains the trip
down to Miami.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.589
Let's keep walking.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.890
What is it?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.025
Gray Chevy Caprice
across the street,

05:58.058 --> 06:00.594
two white males inside.

06:00.628 --> 06:01.962
Sitting on us?

06:01.995 --> 06:02.796
They were here before
we went to go see Warner.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.599
Who?

06:05.633 --> 06:06.867
I don't know.
Let's go ask them.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.473
( tires squealing )

06:12.506 --> 06:14.107
BENSON:
What the hell
is this,

06:14.141 --> 06:14.908
Internal Affairs?

06:14.942 --> 06:16.910
Let the rat squad
spin their wheels.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.849
Let me take a look at
that necklace again, huh?

06:24.585 --> 06:27.488
So Livia Tellez is
a hooker with a soul, huh?

06:29.523 --> 06:32.626
Sounds like someone
Sister Peg would want
to save, doesn't it?

06:37.865 --> 06:40.000
SISTER PEG:
Sorry, Detectives.
I've never seen her.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.503
But I'll say a prayer.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.204
She went by Livia Tellez,
from Queens.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.106
Can you show this
to some of the girls

06:46.139 --> 06:47.207
and see if they knew her?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.576
Of course.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.177
"Dental dams,
1,000 count."

06:50.210 --> 06:51.779
Business must be booming.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.714
Can't keep them
on the shelves.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.049
Sister Peg, ever see
this image before?

06:57.618 --> 07:00.554
Looks like the Blessed Virgin
of the Rosary.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.089
Our Lady of Chiquinquira.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.891
Never heard
of her.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.827
The image is based
on a miraculous painting.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.963
See how she's standing
on the crescent moon?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.465
Our victim was wearing this.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.000
Does it mean anything
significant?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.869
Our Lady of Chiquinquira
is the patroness of Colombia.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.971
I'd guess that's where
your victim was from.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.709
Father Castrillon is the pastor
of St. Augustine's

07:21.742 --> 07:23.243
in Queens.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.879
A lot of his congregation
is Colombian.

07:25.913 --> 07:29.883
If she practiced her faith,
maybe he knew her.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.553
MAN:
Last time I saw Livia,
she seemed so troubled,

07:32.586 --> 07:33.921
but she wouldn't let me help.

07:33.954 --> 07:34.922
When was that,
Father?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.557
Two or three months ago.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.493
She stopped coming to mass
around then.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.828
I bet she was
a member

07:40.861 --> 07:42.129
of the parish
for, like,
two years?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.831
That's right.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.533
She tell you
where she was before that?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.100
No, she was very secretive.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.537
I think she wanted
to tell me.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.171
That's why I asked her
to come to confession,

07:51.204 --> 07:53.774
that God would forgive all.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.876
She promised as soon
as she finished
her work.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.811
She say what kind
of work?

07:57.845 --> 07:59.813
No, but it must
have paid well.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.550
When she first came
to this parish,

08:02.583 --> 08:05.886
she donated all her furniture
for our charity drive

08:05.919 --> 08:07.521
and wouldn't
take a cent for it.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.189
Just asked us
to pick it up from storage.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.257
Do you happen
to remember

08:10.290 --> 08:11.792
where the storage
facility was?

08:11.825 --> 08:14.928
We hired a moving van
to go get it,

08:14.962 --> 08:16.730
but I believe
we have the invoice

08:16.764 --> 08:20.033
from the moving company,
so perhaps it has the address.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.905
BENSON:
Okay, here we go:
Livia Tellez's unit.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.940
Paid for in cash,
three years in advance.

08:32.813 --> 08:36.083
Everything we want
to know about her,
all in one room.

08:42.189 --> 08:45.225
Ah, 1999 taxes.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.603
Filed under Livia Sandoval.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.807
It's a different social
altogether.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.642
But she didn't change
her first name.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.246
There's something here
from 2001.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.783
That's the year she changed
to her new identity.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.687
Liv.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.594
She was a cop.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.428
MAN:
Detectives?

09:23.096 --> 09:24.932
I didn't know
there were rats in here.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.199
It's the gray Chevy
Caprice boys.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.601
BENSON:
Why are you tailing us?

09:27.635 --> 09:28.902
Agents Jack Hammond,
Tim Donovan,

09:28.936 --> 09:30.604
Drug Enforcement
Administration.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.272
I think it's time
we all had a sit-down.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.174
Don't you?

09:40.313 --> 09:42.149
Why is the DEA
following my detectives?

09:42.182 --> 09:43.917
We needed to make sure
that they weren't

09:43.951 --> 09:45.886
working for the people
we were investigating.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.887
STABLER:
You sure now?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.221
If I weren't,
you'd already be

09:48.255 --> 09:50.624
in federal lockup,
Detective Stabler.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.959
Officer Sandoval's
prints were

09:51.992 --> 09:53.126
red-flagged
in the system.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.728
When you ran them,
it tipped us off.

09:54.762 --> 09:55.729
BENSON:
And it never

09:55.763 --> 09:57.064
occurred to you
that we ran them

09:57.097 --> 09:58.365
because we were
investigating her murder?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.767
At the time,

09:59.800 --> 10:01.001
I didn't know
she was dead.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.302
Officer Sandoval
checked in

10:02.335 --> 10:04.004
every two weeks
with Agent Donovan

10:04.037 --> 10:05.205
to minimize exposure.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.841
A week ago, she
was alive and did not

10:07.875 --> 10:08.408
indicate
any problems.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.977
She got burned?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.812
DONOVAN:
We have two other
operatives inside.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.714
They say her cover
was intact.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.716
We're not sure
why she was killed.

10:15.749 --> 10:16.817
They cut her tongue out.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.018
That seems like a message.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.287
HAMMOND:
We can't comment
on that.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.255
Well, then, maybe
you can comment

10:22.289 --> 10:24.725
on what Livia Sandoval
was doing for the DEA.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.093
She was part
of an intel case

10:26.126 --> 10:28.395
that intersected
with our own investigation.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.396
NYPD loaned her to us.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.698
What case?

10:30.731 --> 10:31.999
We can't say.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.102
Well, let's see,
a Colombian undercover

10:35.135 --> 10:37.437
with a key of cocaine
on her fur coat

10:37.470 --> 10:38.571
working
for the DEA?

10:38.605 --> 10:42.242
I wonder who could she possibly
have been investigating?

10:42.275 --> 10:43.343
Let's cut the crap.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.845
An NYPD officer was raped

10:44.878 --> 10:46.113
and murdered on your watch.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.148
If you think
we're gonna let this slide,

10:48.181 --> 10:49.349
you're dreaming.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.184
Hey, nobody wants
this guy to skate,

10:51.218 --> 10:52.953
but this is two years of work,

10:52.986 --> 10:55.022
hundreds of thousands
of dollars invested...

10:55.055 --> 10:56.023
DONOVAN:
Our operatives

10:56.056 --> 10:58.391
were introduced into the
organization by Livia.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.761
If word gets out
she was a cop, they're dead.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.063
BENSON:
And if we do nothing
on a case that's been

11:03.096 --> 11:05.132
all over the papers,
it's just as conspicuous.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.368
Okay, we can play ball here.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.004
We investigate the murder
of Livia Tellez,

11:11.038 --> 11:13.240
a hooker who was
dating a drug dealer.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.943
Nobody has to hear about
the DEA or the undercover job.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.715
Nothing written
regarding DEA involvement

11:21.749 --> 11:23.216
or Livia's true identity.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.353
It'd be subject
to subpoena by the defense.

11:26.386 --> 11:29.056
And not a word to your ADA.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.791
Fine. You want to give us
a place to start?

11:30.824 --> 11:31.759
HAMMOND:
No, we don't.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.728
You wanted this case,
Captain. You got it.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.931
Good luck.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.903
From now on, this room
is command central.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.272
Everything pertinent
to this case stays in here.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.041
The fewer people who know the
particulars, the better.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.910
We got plenty reasons
to be paranoid.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.011
Colombian
drug organizations

11:51.044 --> 11:52.913
got a lot of people
on the payroll.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.515
What do we know about the
victim's true identity?

11:55.548 --> 11:56.616
Livia Sandoval.

11:56.649 --> 12:00.520
Entered this country in 1993
from Medellin, Colombia

12:00.553 --> 12:02.289
at the age of 13.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.892
At 18 she
became a citizen.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.960
She attended Hudson
University two years,

12:06.994 --> 12:09.863
and then in 2000 she took the
police exam and nailed it.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.031
MUNCH:
We're thinking Intel

12:11.064 --> 12:12.900
snapped her up
out of the applicant pool

12:12.933 --> 12:13.967
to the Police Academy.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.002
So we can assume
at some point

12:15.035 --> 12:16.069
she made friends
with a member

12:16.103 --> 12:16.937
of a Colombian
organization.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.172
We have any idea
who she was looking at?

12:19.206 --> 12:20.540
FIN:
It could be
anyone, anywhere.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.541
In Narcotics
we found

12:21.574 --> 12:23.543
Colombian stash houses

12:23.576 --> 12:26.146
in Yonkers, Queens,
Jersey, Manhattan...

12:26.179 --> 12:27.781
CRAGEN:
You got an old pal
in Narcotics

12:27.815 --> 12:29.149
you can trust?

12:29.182 --> 12:31.084
I got one guy I came up
through the ranks with.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.921
He's as straight
as they come.

12:33.954 --> 12:37.024
You gotta be kidding me
with this deep throat crap.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.826
You got any
better ideas?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.493
Yeah. Stay the hell
away from this case.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.528
These are bad guys.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.096
That can't be helped.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.932
They dropped a rape
victim in my lap.

12:44.965 --> 12:45.933
What'd you find?

12:45.966 --> 12:47.400
Two-year DEA investigation.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.803
Dead girl living in Jackson
Heights from Medellin.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.204
Sounds like they're
looking to extradite.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.405
Who?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.074
Cesar Velez.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.408
Oh, I remember
that name.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.477
He whacked a judge
and a CIA informant

12:57.510 --> 12:59.279
in Bogota a couple
of years back.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.480
He's a major player.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.983
Supplies 10% of the coke
coming into the U.S.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.551
Who handles his
business on this side?

13:04.584 --> 13:06.086
Well, he has some cousins

13:06.119 --> 13:07.554
running the wholesale
side in Queens,

13:07.587 --> 13:10.057
cutting and distributing
to the Dominican dealers.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.125
We popped a few of them
on small possession beefs,

13:12.159 --> 13:14.094
but we can't get
a handle on the big stuff.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.096
Collar anybody
that'll cooperate?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.165
You looking to steal
a snitch from me?

13:18.198 --> 13:19.833
I just want
to talk to him.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.402
Your name
never comes up.

13:22.435 --> 13:23.403
Dominican dealer.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.605
Felix Santos.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.942
He sells up in Washington
Heights by the bus terminal.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.944
He's a punk, but
if you bust him

13:30.978 --> 13:32.880
for possession, he'll talk.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.347
You know I owe you.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.248
Hey, be careful, man.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.851
These guys blow up
commercial airliners

13:37.885 --> 13:39.086
just to kill one person.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.253
There's no rules.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.557
There you go, Felix.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.492
Papa, that's regular.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.960
I said diet.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.429
You're gonna want
the sugar, so drink it.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.532
Okay. You people wanna treat me
like that, that's fine.

13:52.565 --> 13:56.103
I'll just make my phone call to
some very influential peoples.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.437
They tell you
what my rate is.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.972
Rate for what?

13:59.006 --> 14:01.041
My assistance,
and let me tell you,

14:01.074 --> 14:03.376
the price is going
up by the second.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.278
Say we don't
pop you for possession

14:05.312 --> 14:06.479
with intent
to distribute?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.249
Whatever.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.383
You know her?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.920
Yeah. That Livia.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.087
Biscocha.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.056
Why you call her a cream puff?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.057
Rafael made it up.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.391
Yeah, well,
she's dead.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.927
Who's Rafael?

14:22.429 --> 14:23.663
Rafael Zapata.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.266
Lieutenant for
Cesar Velez.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.401
FIN:
How did Rafael
and Livia know each other?

14:28.435 --> 14:31.638
She was banging him. I mean,
one of the girls banging him.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.073
Look, I only met her

14:33.106 --> 14:34.141
a couple of times.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.076
She was hot
and everything,

14:36.109 --> 14:37.945
but when she got high,
she got mouthy.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.246
Rafael doesn't like that.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.580
Define "mouthy."

14:40.613 --> 14:42.149
I saw them a
couple of weeks ago.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.650
She's going on
about how Rafael

14:43.683 --> 14:45.452
couldn't get it up
in the bedroom.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.586
I mean, come on.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.955
What kind of stupid girl

14:47.988 --> 14:49.589
is going to say that
about a man?

14:49.622 --> 14:50.991
In front of his friends?

14:51.024 --> 14:53.026
And what would a man like Rafael

14:53.060 --> 14:54.494
do in this situation?

14:54.527 --> 14:57.497
That time,
he smacked her up good.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.601
STABLER:
Rafael Zapata Gaviria, 34,

15:01.634 --> 15:03.603
the number one guy
in Cesar Velez's organization.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.505
Zapata's a Colombian national

15:05.538 --> 15:08.175
in this country
on a legitimate work visa.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.476
Purchased for ten Gs

15:09.509 --> 15:11.078
in Bogota most likely.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.246
Zapata was arrested
twice in Queens

15:13.280 --> 15:16.016
for murder and conspiracy to
commit murder, never indicted.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.151
It seems somebody always
conveniently came forward

15:18.185 --> 15:19.486
and confessed to the crimes.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.520
Yeah, somebody
with family

15:20.553 --> 15:21.688
back in Colombia.

15:21.721 --> 15:22.990
Velez holds them
as collateral.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.324
He could slaughter
them at will.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.193
It's a big incentive
to do what you're told.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.028
I ran Zapata's financials.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.197
He's quite the businessman.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.065
He owns several
cellular phone and pager stores,

15:32.099 --> 15:33.600
real estate
both here and in Miami,

15:33.633 --> 15:37.971
and recently spent $1.5 million
on oil-drilling equipment.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.272
Money laundering.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.074
You pay 30 times
more than it's worth.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.176
It looks like
a legitimate transaction.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.979
The Feds have gotta have
all of this stuff already.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.714
So what we need to do
is corroborate

15:47.747 --> 15:50.183
Santos's statement
and tie Zapata to Livia.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.485
BENSON:
Well, we've got
his credit card charges

15:52.519 --> 15:54.321
on the day of Livia's murder.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.024
He flew back from Miami
on the same flight that she did,

15:57.057 --> 15:58.391
spent four grand shopping,

15:58.425 --> 16:00.127
going to dinner
and seeing a show.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.394
Well, that's
a lot of cash

16:01.428 --> 16:02.429
to spend in one day.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.132
If she was with him,
somebody's gotta remember.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.170
MAN:
Two for lunch?

16:10.203 --> 16:12.272
I'd like to speak with
the manager, please.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.373
That's me. What about?

16:13.406 --> 16:14.374
A customer of yours.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.543
He was here the other
night-- Rafael Zapata?

16:16.576 --> 16:19.212
I'm sorry,
I don't know that person.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.782
We'll keep your name
out of this.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.218
Now... was he here
with this woman?

16:25.252 --> 16:26.153
No, he wasn't.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.055
Look, we can charge you
with obstruction.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.256
We don't want to do that.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.458
Then charge me.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.761
I have a wife and three children
and I can't help you.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.096
( phone ringing )

16:36.129 --> 16:37.364
Either Zapata paid
him real well,

16:37.397 --> 16:38.498
or scared the
piss out of him.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.499
Or both.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.701
Benson.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.103
Agent Donovan.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.271
I didn't expect
to hear from you.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.609
What's he want?

16:49.642 --> 16:51.211
A meeting. Now.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.412
Where?

16:52.445 --> 16:54.447
Apparently, on the
roof across the street.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.119
You talked to my informant.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.187
Yeah. We were
investigating

17:00.220 --> 17:01.554
our rape case,
as instructed.

17:01.588 --> 17:02.589
Who gave him to you?

17:02.622 --> 17:04.557
Oh, so now we're supposed
to share information

17:04.591 --> 17:05.658
with you because
you've been

17:05.692 --> 17:06.726
so forthcoming
with us? Screw you.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.461
He's working with DEA.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.028
You guys are putting

17:09.062 --> 17:09.829
everything in jeopardy.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.598
Well, then he must
be moonlighting

17:11.631 --> 17:12.399
with NYPD Narcotics,

17:12.432 --> 17:14.033
'cause that's how
we found him.

17:15.835 --> 17:16.803
You're off him.

17:16.836 --> 17:17.804
Oh, yeah?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.206
Yeah.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.707
Yeah. Nobody
from your squad

17:20.740 --> 17:22.309
contacts Santos again.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.078
Felix has been apprised
of the situation.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.247
We warned you to use caution.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.481
And we have.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.084
Santos doesn't know
that Livia was a cop.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.652
Nobody said a word about DEA.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.387
Keep it that way. We're done.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.758
Hey, did you
tell Livia to do coke

17:38.791 --> 17:39.792
and screw Zapata
to make your case,

17:39.826 --> 17:41.761
or was that her idea?

17:41.794 --> 17:43.563
You don't know
anything about her.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.831
I know you
were supposed

17:44.864 --> 17:46.733
to protect her
and you let her die!

17:49.269 --> 17:50.803
And I know you
feel so guilty,

17:50.837 --> 17:53.440
that you'd rather
let her killer get away with it

17:53.473 --> 17:56.143
than think about what you
didn't do to help her.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.246
I didn't tell her
to do drugs.

17:59.279 --> 18:03.116
I didn't tell her
to do any of that.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.083
She wanted to
nail those guys

18:04.117 --> 18:05.885
and she did what she
thought she had to do.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.155
And you didn't you see
how bad it was getting?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.088
She was getting
the job done.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.823
I didn't think she
was in over her head.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.228
I should've pulled her.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.430
I didn't.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.467
That's my responsibility.
My... my mistake.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.703
Hey!

18:23.736 --> 18:25.172
We have no intention

18:25.205 --> 18:26.206
of tanking your case,

18:26.239 --> 18:29.142
and we realize that
other lives are at stake,

18:29.176 --> 18:30.910
but we're flying blind here.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.512
And you don't
tell us something

18:32.545 --> 18:33.446
to implicate Zapata,

18:33.480 --> 18:35.815
then we are never
gonna make this right.

18:37.484 --> 18:41.154
Your ME found bits
of fiberglass on her body.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.757
Then I know where he killed her.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.261
BENSON:
Zapata's love boat.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.929
Keeps it in Battery Park.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.564
He must be compensating
for something

18:51.598 --> 18:52.732
to need a yacht that big.

18:52.765 --> 18:53.866
What's the connection?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.768
Well, ME found
slivers of fiberglass

18:55.802 --> 18:56.903
in the victim's leg.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.406
The hull of that yacht
is made of the same material.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.408
Now, we just found out
that Zapata owned it.

19:01.441 --> 19:02.909
We didn't know
because all his assets

19:02.942 --> 19:04.577
are held under
shell companies.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.279
How'd you find out?

19:06.313 --> 19:07.113
Confidential informant.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.715
Now, is that
enough for a warrant?

19:08.748 --> 19:10.850
As long as
the informant's reliable.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.252
Beyond reproach.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.486
Has he provided
accurate information

19:13.520 --> 19:14.621
for you in the past?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.357
No. But the nature of his job
puts him in a position

19:17.390 --> 19:18.891
to receive
sensitive information,

19:18.925 --> 19:20.193
and, Alex,
we believe him.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.494
Well, that's very comforting.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.230
Now tell me something
that will actually

19:23.263 --> 19:24.331
help me get the warrant.

19:24.364 --> 19:27.200
Alex, you've gotta trust us.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.605
Police! Put your hands up
where I can see them!

19:32.639 --> 19:33.606
Hands! Now!

19:33.640 --> 19:35.708
( salsa music playing )

19:35.742 --> 19:37.277
Move.

19:37.310 --> 19:41.448
Rafael Zapata Gaviria!

19:41.481 --> 19:42.449
( music stops )

19:42.482 --> 19:43.216
Zapata!

19:46.286 --> 19:47.754
I am Rafael Zapata.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.290
You may put your weapons away.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.558
We are all peaceful here.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.792
Mr. Zapata, we
have a warrant

19:52.825 --> 19:53.793
to search this vessel.

19:53.826 --> 19:54.727
Everybody out, now!

19:54.761 --> 19:56.429
Line 'em up on the docks.
That means you.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.730
Let's go. Out.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.866
May I ask what's
this regarding?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.801
I have nothing to hide.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.471
You sure about that?

20:04.504 --> 20:08.275
Law enforcement is always
searching my private property.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.476
They never find anything.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.244
Well, this time,
you don't know

20:11.278 --> 20:12.445
what we're looking for.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.253
Smell that?

20:20.287 --> 20:21.388
Bleach.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.422
Yeah.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.761
Flip it.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.298
Okay.

20:36.769 --> 20:37.604
It's damp here.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.947
Bleach worked
on the surface.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.617
It just didn't go deep enough.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.588
Hey! Rafael Zapata,
you're under arrest

20:55.622 --> 20:57.290
for the murder
of Livia Tellez.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.090
Get up.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.592
Put your hands
behind your back.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.560
You're under arrest.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.795
You're making a very
big mistake, Detective.

21:02.829 --> 21:03.730
You don't even know

21:03.763 --> 21:05.432
how many mistakes
you've made. Let's go.

21:10.737 --> 21:14.774
Docket ending 644: People v.
Rafael Zapata Gaviria.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.009
One count each,
murder in the second degree,

21:17.043 --> 21:18.445
rape in
the first degree.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.413
Lionel Granger for the defense,
Your Honor.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.881
How does
the defendant plead?

21:21.914 --> 21:23.015
Not guilty.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.451
Ms. Cabot?

21:24.484 --> 21:25.852
The defendant is
a Colombian national

21:25.885 --> 21:27.954
with known ties
to major drug organizations.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.390
He has unlimited resources
at his disposal,

21:30.423 --> 21:31.958
and we consider him
a flight risk.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.726
We request remand,
Your Honor.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.827
My client
has never been

21:34.861 --> 21:37.430
charged with
anything related
to drug trafficking,

21:37.464 --> 21:39.632
and I consider
the People's
baseless accusation

21:39.666 --> 21:41.634
slanderous and bigoted.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.870
Noted, Mr. Granger.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.539
But I'd really like to hear your
thoughts on the matter of bail.

21:46.573 --> 21:47.374
Mr. Zapata is

21:47.407 --> 21:49.676
a respected business
and family man.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.078
He has no intention
of fleeing this jurisdiction

21:52.111 --> 21:54.414
and is willing
to turn over his passport

21:54.447 --> 21:55.615
for the pendency of the case.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.617
The defendant has
among his assets

21:57.650 --> 21:58.951
a Gulfstream jet,
Your Honor,

21:58.985 --> 22:00.520
as well as
personal airstrips

22:00.553 --> 22:02.589
in the Caribbean
and South America.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.091
Turning over his
passport is a
meaningless gesture.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.627
He's blessed with wealth,
so he must be guilty?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.896
He has a clean
record, Your Honor.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.600
And his passport won't be
the only thing he turns over.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.102
Bail is set at $5 million.
Next case.

22:16.135 --> 22:19.472
Docket ending 872: People...

22:20.840 --> 22:24.611
Arnold, Zapata still
has you on retainer, I see.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.480
That explains
the $3,000 suit.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.482
How did you
get the blood out?

22:29.516 --> 22:31.451
My wife bought
me this suit.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.986
Everybody deserves
a defense, Alex.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.622
I would
believe your idealism

22:35.655 --> 22:37.924
if you weren't enjoying
yourself so much.

22:37.957 --> 22:38.891
I'm just
a naturally

22:38.925 --> 22:41.027
happy person.

22:41.060 --> 22:41.961
What is this?

22:41.994 --> 22:44.431
Motion to controvert
the search warrant.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.065
And I will enjoy this.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.840
The warrant to search my
client's private property

22:53.873 --> 22:55.442
was executed
based on information

22:55.475 --> 22:57.143
received from
a confidential informant.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.144
Which is a
common occurrence.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.178
It was a warrant

22:59.211 --> 23:00.046
you signed yourself,
Your Honor.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.048
Based upon
your detectives' affidavit

23:02.081 --> 23:03.683
that the informant met the test

23:03.716 --> 23:04.984
for reliability.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.519
Look, there's
no reason
to belabor this.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.386
Produce the guy,

23:07.420 --> 23:08.555
show me he knows
what he's talking about,

23:08.588 --> 23:09.489
and I'll be satisfied.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.458
Your Honor, this defeats
the entire purpose

23:11.491 --> 23:12.525
of the use of C.I.s.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.761
People v. Goggins:
the identity of an informant

23:14.794 --> 23:15.695
may be kept confidential

23:15.728 --> 23:17.697
to protect both the
flow of information

23:17.730 --> 23:18.998
and the safety
of the informant.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.900
How do we even know
this person exists?

23:20.933 --> 23:22.001
Let's start with
the fact that

23:22.034 --> 23:23.770
the information was accurate.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.572
That doesn't
prove the
informant's

23:25.605 --> 23:27.039
legal veracity,
and you know that, Ms. Cabot.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.040
The forensic
evidence

23:28.074 --> 23:29.809
supported the C.I.'s statement.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.579
A couple pieces
of fiberglass?

23:32.612 --> 23:33.279
Do you know
how many things

23:33.312 --> 23:34.213
are made out
of fiberglass?

23:34.246 --> 23:36.649
She could have been killed
in a Corvette.

23:36.683 --> 23:39.018
The fibers matched
the hull of
Mr. Zapata's yacht.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.087
I can show you ten yachts
in that marina

23:41.120 --> 23:42.655
made of the same material.

23:42.689 --> 23:43.923
But you can't show me
the mattress

23:43.956 --> 23:45.224
soaked in the victim's blood.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.158
That possession is unique

23:46.192 --> 23:47.594
to your client.

23:47.627 --> 23:48.995
This person knew
the location

23:49.028 --> 23:50.597
of a homicide.
That's it.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.931
For all we know,
the so-called informant

23:51.964 --> 23:53.666
could have committed
the murder himself.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.968
Your Honor, I hope you can
see this for what it is--

23:56.002 --> 23:59.071
a scare tactic
to intimidate an informant.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.840
I'm ordering
a Darden hearing.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.776
Ms. Cabot, you are
to produce the informant,

24:03.810 --> 24:06.012
and I will interview him
in camera.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.914
If I find
that he meets

24:07.947 --> 24:09.949
the test
for reliability,

24:09.982 --> 24:13.620
the evidence
from the search stays.

24:13.653 --> 24:14.887
Your informant
would only have

24:14.921 --> 24:16.489
to talk to the judge
in chambers.

24:16.523 --> 24:17.790
No one else
would be present.

24:17.824 --> 24:18.591
No good, Alex.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.126
Elliot, it's
going to have to be.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.127
I put my neck
on the line

24:21.160 --> 24:22.128
for you two people.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.162
I would like it back.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.697
He could lose his job.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.065
Worst case,
he could get killed.

24:26.098 --> 24:26.666
Well, he should
have thought
about that

24:26.699 --> 24:28.167
before he talked
to you.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.902
Who is he?

24:37.744 --> 24:39.145
Alex Cabot, with
the D.A.'s office.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.179
Were you followed?

24:40.212 --> 24:41.213
I beg your pardon?

24:41.247 --> 24:42.615
Did anyone follow you

24:42.649 --> 24:44.216
from your office
to the DEA?

24:44.250 --> 24:45.117
I don't believe so,

24:45.151 --> 24:47.787
but I can't be sure.

24:47.820 --> 24:48.755
And now you're going to tell me

24:48.788 --> 24:49.956
how you know all about my job,

24:49.989 --> 24:51.123
and how you know
this is dangerous

24:51.157 --> 24:52.925
but you can protect me.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.093
Is that about right?

24:54.126 --> 24:56.095
I freely admit
I know very little

24:56.128 --> 24:57.764
about the dangers
of your job.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.231
But that doesn't change the fact

24:59.265 --> 25:02.034
that you gave information
as a confidential informant,

25:02.068 --> 25:04.136
and now that information
has to be verified.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.539
You won't have
to testify in open court.

25:06.573 --> 25:08.074
The answer's no.

25:08.107 --> 25:11.010
Let me tell you a little bit
about my job, Agent Donovan.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.244
After I tell the judge

25:12.278 --> 25:14.614
that I cannot
produce the informant,

25:14.647 --> 25:17.083
she is going to issue
John Doe material
witness order.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.718
If I don't
give her your name,

25:18.751 --> 25:20.319
I will be found in contempt.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.022
That's your call.
Your conscience.

25:23.055 --> 25:23.990
I can tell
you right now,

25:24.023 --> 25:24.957
I'm not
going to jail

25:24.991 --> 25:27.059
for you or
for my conscience.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.194
Then drop the case.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.996
I can't.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.331
Look, you do what you
gotta do, Ms. Cabot.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.166
But when things go down,

25:34.200 --> 25:36.869
the blood's
gonna be on your hands.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.971
There has to be
a way to work this out

25:39.005 --> 25:40.740
so that everyone
is protected.

25:42.341 --> 25:45.311
You really don't know anything
about this, do you?

25:51.083 --> 25:54.186
Your SVU detectives got you
in a real mess, Alexandra.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.223
They were trying to cooperate
with a Federal investigation.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.058
They didn't have much
of a choice.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.293
I'm not asking you
to defend them.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.596
I'm just trying to figure how
you're going to get out of it.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.731
There's nothing
to get out of.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.766
Petrovsky will subpoena
the DEA agent,

26:06.799 --> 26:08.134
the warrant will stand,

26:08.167 --> 26:10.269
and Zapata will go away
for 25 to life.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.838
That easy, huh?

26:11.871 --> 26:13.906
Everyone understands

26:13.940 --> 26:16.342
the sensitive nature
of the DEA investigation.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.811
Petrovsky has no reason
to jeopardize that.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.212
All efforts will be made

26:20.246 --> 26:22.815
to maintain
the witness's confidentiality.

26:22.849 --> 26:24.817
So you're operating
under the theory that

26:24.851 --> 26:26.385
if we don't see
the immediate threat,

26:26.418 --> 26:27.620
then it must not be real.

26:27.654 --> 26:28.955
I know it's real.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.957
An NYPD officer is dead
because of it.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.659
Yes. That's true.

26:32.692 --> 26:36.228
And how many people would you
guess know that information now?

26:36.262 --> 26:37.830
I'm not sure.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.932
A dozen, maybe more.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.100
Yeah, that

26:41.133 --> 26:42.234
sounds about right.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.003
Now, you know as well as I do

26:44.036 --> 26:46.305
that "confidential"
is a relative term,

26:46.338 --> 26:48.741
directly proportionate
to how interesting

26:48.775 --> 26:50.910
said confidential
information is.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.881
And this is too
interesting, Alexandra.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.916
Cut Zapata a deal.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.186
Manslaughter:
eight to ten.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.888
Pass.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.656
Maybe you should ask
your client what he thinks.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.157
I also pass.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.759
What are you even
bargaining with, Alex?

27:06.793 --> 27:08.194
You don't have a case.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.797
You certainly
don't have your
alleged informant.

27:10.830 --> 27:14.000
I will have the informant once
the judge issues her subpoena.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.035
You are assuming that
the informant will comply

27:16.068 --> 27:17.704
with the judge's request.

27:17.737 --> 27:20.740
And why wouldn't
he, Mr. Zapata?

27:20.773 --> 27:23.976
Who can say why people do
what they do?

27:24.010 --> 27:25.311
It's a mystery.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.346
You don't know
who the informant is,

27:27.379 --> 27:30.016
so how can you possibly know
what he might do?

27:30.049 --> 27:31.017
So you say.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.084
I'll tell
you what.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.853
You get your informant
lined up,

27:33.886 --> 27:35.187
I promise we'll take the deal.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.288
Take it now
or it's gone.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.423
And, for future reference,

27:37.456 --> 27:39.826
if your client intimidates
the informant in any way,

27:39.859 --> 27:41.060
I will have his bail revoked

27:41.093 --> 27:43.763
and his ass thrown in Rikers
for the duration of the trial.

27:43.796 --> 27:46.465
You can't threaten me, bitch.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.300
I just did.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.836
We're going.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.838
You allow this?

27:51.871 --> 27:54.106
A woman says
these things,

27:54.140 --> 27:55.875
and you do nothing?

27:55.908 --> 27:58.344
Yes, Mr. Zapata.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.246
You will also find
that a woman can say

28:00.279 --> 28:03.249
whatever she wants to about your
performance in the bedroom,

28:03.282 --> 28:05.284
and you aren't actually
allowed to kill her.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.127
Let's not do anything stupid.

28:15.161 --> 28:18.030
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

28:21.067 --> 28:24.370
Okay, that was fun.

28:26.305 --> 28:27.807
Let's go, Rafael.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.522
STABLER:
You're out of your mind.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.425
I was hoping he would think
about that information
coming out in open court.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.294
And he pissed you off.
Yeah. That too.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.429
What does Branch say
now that the deal's
been shut down?

28:50.462 --> 28:53.900
We move forward with the trial.
We give the DEA's office
fair warning,

28:53.933 --> 28:56.502
and they have the opportunity
to pull their undercovers
if they think it's necessary.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.104
You're going to
blow a two-year
investigation?

28:58.137 --> 29:01.073
This is the best option
of only bad options.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.441
We either
prosecute Zapata ourselves

29:02.474 --> 29:04.443
or we drop it,
give him back his passport,

29:04.476 --> 29:07.146
he leaves the country, and
the DEA's case is blown anyway.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.081
Look, the fact
of the matter is
Hello.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.950
that Zapata
blew the DEA's
investigation wide open

29:10.983 --> 29:12.484
when he raped
and murdered
Livia Sandoval.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.020
There you go.
Okay. Bye.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.122
I just got called
to an ex parte meeting

29:16.155 --> 29:17.523
in Judge Petrovsky's chambers.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.158
What do you think
that's about?

29:19.191 --> 29:20.492
Nothing good.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.028
Excuse me.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.933
ADA Cabot, I'm
George Reilly with the DOJ,

29:26.966 --> 29:28.935
and this is Daniel Clark
and Brian Sullivan

29:28.968 --> 29:31.037
with the United States
Attorney's Office.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.005
You might be wondering
what this is about.

29:33.039 --> 29:36.809
Can I guess? The federal
government is about
to steamroll New York.

29:36.843 --> 29:39.278
This is a protective order
issued by a federal judge

29:39.311 --> 29:41.513
in the southern district
of New York State

29:41.547 --> 29:43.883
barring Judge Petrovsky
from subpoenaing

29:43.916 --> 29:45.317
a federal law
enforcement agent

29:45.351 --> 29:48.254
on the grounds that
it would jeopardize
an ongoing investigation.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.922
There's nothing
we can do about this?

29:49.956 --> 29:51.590
Not unless
you have other evidence

29:51.623 --> 29:53.292
to support probable cause.

29:53.325 --> 29:54.493
Your search is out.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.428
Your honor, it's...
I don't like it
either, Ms. Cabot.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.966
And, Mr. Reilly, I don't ever

29:59.999 --> 30:02.334
want this many lawyers
in my chambers again,

30:02.368 --> 30:03.836
so, next time,

30:03.870 --> 30:06.205
leave the dog and pony show
at home.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.040
Understood, Your Honor.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.611
BENSON:
They can just

30:12.644 --> 30:14.613
go over the
judge's head,
and that's it?

30:14.646 --> 30:17.216
I'm going to appeal it
to the Second Circuit.

30:17.249 --> 30:20.086
Now we're getting
into a violation
of states' rights.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.453
Ms. Cabot...
I thought
you didn't want

30:21.487 --> 30:22.889
to show your face
around here.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.056
We've received
a credible threat.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.324
It didn't come from us.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.493
We have kept your
identity confidential.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.896
The threat was made against you.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.537
MAN 1:
Hey. How's my girlfriend?

30:38.570 --> 30:40.372
MAN 2:
Good. Very good.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.008
The second guy's an inmate

30:42.041 --> 30:43.876
incarcerated at
a federal penitentiary

30:43.910 --> 30:45.377
in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.

30:45.411 --> 30:46.645
One of Cesar Velez's guys.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.048
This call was recorded
six hours ago.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.050
We haven't yet
identified the other man.

30:51.083 --> 30:54.286
MAN 1:
I'm gonna pick her up--
maybe this week.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.523
MAN 2:
All right. She's living
at 235 West 78th,

30:57.556 --> 30:59.225
apartment "C" like "Charlie."

30:59.258 --> 31:00.392
Gets home around 8:00.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.894
That's my address.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.395
MAN 1:
What are her mornings like?

31:03.429 --> 31:04.396
MAN 2:
Jogs at 6:00.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.898
Son of a bitch.

31:05.932 --> 31:08.234
MAN 2:
You could go jogging with her.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.102
Central Park.

31:10.136 --> 31:12.371
MAN 1:
I was thinking
I could visit her mother.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.673
MAN 2:
That's an idea. Mom lives
upstate-- East Amherst.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.375
Oh, my God.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.210
MAN 2:
But you should really try
to see your girlfriend.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.678
It's important.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.447
How do they know this?

31:21.480 --> 31:23.549
Cesar Velez
has a network

31:23.582 --> 31:25.417
in the federal prisons.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.987
We're trying to ascertain where
the information's coming from.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.355
Have you noticed anyone
following you?

31:29.388 --> 31:30.689
Any problems with your

31:30.722 --> 31:33.592
telephone service
at the office or your home?

31:33.625 --> 31:36.162
Uh... no. Not
that I can remember.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.596
Okay. So, as of now,

31:37.629 --> 31:38.664
we get a protective detail.

31:38.697 --> 31:41.333
You step foot outside,
you have an armed escort.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.102
We're going to have
to rig a security system

31:43.135 --> 31:44.436
at the office and the apartment.

31:44.470 --> 31:45.471
Federal Marshal's
already

31:45.504 --> 31:46.638
lined up to escort you.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.274
Should be here within the hour.

31:48.307 --> 31:51.343
No. I want to go home now.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.345
Okay. We'll take you.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.221
Ms. Cabot?

32:03.722 --> 32:05.691
We're going
to find the guy.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.561
And we'll
tie him to Zapata.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.163
He'll go away for life.

32:11.197 --> 32:13.399
Okay.

32:13.432 --> 32:17.436
And if we can't,
I'll go to your judge.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.139
I'll testify
in open court.

32:20.172 --> 32:23.075
So I don't
want you to worry.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.710
This is handled.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.245
Got it?

32:28.014 --> 32:30.016
Got it.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.418
Good night.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.725
Alex, why don't you
stay with me tonight

32:39.758 --> 32:41.527
until we figure this
whole thing out?

32:41.560 --> 32:43.562
No. It'll be okay.
But thanks.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.764
Okay, let's do a drive-by first,

32:45.797 --> 32:47.599
make sure nothing looks off.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.473
( car alarm beeping )

33:27.506 --> 33:33.779
( people talking,
sirens blaring )

33:33.812 --> 33:36.115
BENSON:
Hey...

33:36.148 --> 33:38.117
come on, let's go.

33:39.618 --> 33:43.322
Alex, you couldn't have done
anything differently.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.523
Donovan made a choice.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.258
We all did.

33:46.292 --> 33:47.426
HAMMOND:
How?

33:47.459 --> 33:49.695
I-I don't know.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.230
You don't know?

33:51.263 --> 33:52.764
He had two kids.
Did you know that?

33:52.798 --> 33:54.266
Knock it off.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.567
You were careless.
You didn't listen.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.436
Do you get it now?
Is it sinking in?

33:57.469 --> 33:59.105
Enough. Enough.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.641
You got to get yourself
off this case.

34:02.674 --> 34:03.775
End of story.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.545
HAMMOND:
Oh, you don't have a case.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.414
It blew up
with Tim Donovan.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.389
Initial report
from the bomb squad

34:17.423 --> 34:19.158
turned up evidence of C-4

34:19.191 --> 34:21.193
and part of the detonator
in the debris field.

34:21.227 --> 34:23.362
They believe the trigger
was rigged to the ignition,

34:23.395 --> 34:25.564
the explosive was placed
under the driver's seat.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.366
Every bomb-maker
has a signature.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.835
FBI lab is running
the individual components

34:29.868 --> 34:32.238
through their database
looking for a match.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.473
Well, it doesn't matter.
We know who did it.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.442
Cesar Velez,
fixing things for Zapata.

34:36.475 --> 34:37.809
The more important question is

34:37.843 --> 34:39.645
how did Velez
know Donovan was the C.O.?

34:39.678 --> 34:41.113
Same way he knows
where you live,

34:41.147 --> 34:42.414
and where your mother lives.

34:42.448 --> 34:43.715
He's got the money
and the power.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.184
STABLER:
And he's not gonna stop

34:45.217 --> 34:46.485
until you back off,
or until you're dead.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.719
CABOT:
I have a
protective detail,

34:47.753 --> 34:49.455
my mom has a
protective detail.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.190
I'm not backing off.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.659
Alex, there's no reason
for you to die for this case.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.662
Men like Zapata and Velez
live on other people's fear.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.664
It doesn't matter
if I try this case

34:58.697 --> 35:00.566
or somebody else
in my office does.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.401
The intimidation
is always there.

35:02.434 --> 35:06.505
So I can either accept
it as a part of my job,

35:06.538 --> 35:08.174
or concede everything.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.178
But I don't want to put
any of that on you.

35:12.211 --> 35:13.712
The DA's office
has investigators...

35:13.745 --> 35:16.182
Who are a bunch
of punks. I'm in.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.249
So am I.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.220
Okay.

35:21.253 --> 35:24.223
Let's start by dragging
in every single guest

35:24.256 --> 35:26.358
from Zapata's
little boat party.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.860
Somebody knows about
Livia's murder.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.663
Alex, can I see you
in my office?

35:33.532 --> 35:36.668
I figured you were too gung ho
to let this die.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.704
Don, I appreciate
the concern.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.172
My old service revolver.

35:40.206 --> 35:42.874
Straight shot, won't jam up.

35:42.908 --> 35:46.445
Had the license division
expedite a carry permit for you.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.713
Without my signature?

35:47.746 --> 35:49.215
Your prints are on file.

35:49.248 --> 35:52.318
Cragen.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.320
Yeah, she's here.

35:54.353 --> 35:55.921
I'll let her know.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.889
Boss is looking for you.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.325
( knock on door )

35:59.358 --> 36:00.926
BRANCH:
Come on in.

36:00.959 --> 36:03.829
Your ears still ringing?

36:03.862 --> 36:05.831
Yeah, a little.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.899
That'll pass.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.701
You know, I had a buddy

36:09.735 --> 36:12.838
that did three
years in Bogota
at the Embassy.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.906
There was a time
when one police officer

36:14.940 --> 36:16.608
got murdered
every single day.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.210
Over a two month period,

36:18.244 --> 36:20.312
Pablo Escobar set
off nine car bombs.

36:20.346 --> 36:23.449
Well, it's a good thing
we live in the United States.

36:23.482 --> 36:24.550
Yes, it is.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.385
And there are
plenty of judges

36:26.418 --> 36:29.321
and prosecutors and former law
enforcement in this country

36:29.355 --> 36:30.589
walking around every day,

36:30.622 --> 36:32.591
the rest of their lives,
with bodyguards

36:32.624 --> 36:34.893
because they stood up
against a Colombian cartel

36:34.926 --> 36:36.962
that will do anything
to protect its business.

36:36.995 --> 36:38.464
That's all
the more reason

36:38.497 --> 36:40.899
to continue to fight them.

36:40.932 --> 36:44.603
We've been fighting them since
before you were born, Alexandra.

36:44.636 --> 36:47.573
Now, we're going to drop
the Zapata case.

36:47.606 --> 36:50.609
Why? How bad
does this have to get?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.544
How many more people
have to die?

36:52.578 --> 36:55.247
From what I hear, the Feds have
a much better case against him

36:55.281 --> 36:57.383
than we would ever have now.

36:57.416 --> 37:01.553
And to answer your question, too
many people have died already.

37:07.426 --> 37:10.562
CABOT:
At this time, Your Honor, the
People are unable to proceed

37:10.596 --> 37:12.798
and are asking that
the indictment
against Rafael Zapata

37:12.831 --> 37:15.701
Gaviria be dismissed
with leave to re-present.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.970
The charges are dismissed,
Mr. Zapata.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.672
Court is adjourned.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.652
U.S. Marshals, Mr. Zapata.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.054
You are under arrest
for the murder of
a federal agent.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.023
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.057
Anything you say can

37:39.090 --> 37:41.960
and will be used
against you in
a court of law.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.895
You have the right to
speak to an attorney

37:43.929 --> 37:46.432
and to have an attorney
present during any
questioning.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.066
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

37:48.099 --> 37:50.336
one will be provided
for you.

37:50.369 --> 37:53.772
The FBI connected
the car bomb to Zapata.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.974
He's gonna flip on Cesar Velez.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.576
If the DEA can get
an indictment,

37:57.609 --> 37:58.910
the Colombians will arrest Velez

37:58.944 --> 38:00.679
and start
the extradition process.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.348
What does Zapata get
for his troubles?

38:02.381 --> 38:03.815
FIN:
A reduced sentence

38:03.849 --> 38:06.585
and a new identity
in Scottsdale,
Arizona probably.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.953
If he lives that long.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.621
And on that note,
I'll say good night.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.423
You have to give me a ride
early tomorrow morning.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.458
You need some sleep.

38:12.491 --> 38:13.759
You need to hire a driver.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.494
ALL:
Good night.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.728
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.063
Bye.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.602
STABLER:
Look, we had
a good run.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.837
Conviction rates are up.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.474
We had to get
screwed sometime.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.042
Cesar Velez can probably do
more damage to Zapata now

38:31.076 --> 38:32.844
than the justice system
ever could.

38:34.446 --> 38:37.616
It just... it never seems
like enough, you know?

38:37.649 --> 38:39.851
The Feds'll get Zapata
for killing Donovan,

38:39.885 --> 38:41.587
but what about
Livia Sandoval?

38:41.620 --> 38:42.888
She dies without any justice

38:42.921 --> 38:44.923
and we're supposed
to be happy about it?

38:44.956 --> 38:46.992
We tell ourselves that
we speak for the victims,

38:47.025 --> 38:49.027
but we don't.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.630
We can close cases,
but the victims,

38:51.663 --> 38:54.633
even if they survive,
their lives are ruined.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.602
I just get so sick of it.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.970
Alex, we can't always win.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.872
But that's just it.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.709
Even when we win, we don't.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.747
Come on...

39:08.780 --> 39:10.782
let's get out of here.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.654
Get you a cab?

39:15.687 --> 39:17.556
No, I'm not far.
I'll walk.

39:17.589 --> 39:18.957
Thanks though.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.692
Look, I'm sorry I'm
such a buzz kill.

39:20.726 --> 39:21.727
Oh, don't be silly.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.728
It's late.

39:22.761 --> 39:23.729
( gunshot )

39:23.762 --> 39:24.730
Get down!

39:25.196 --> 39:26.798
Go! Go! Go!

39:33.204 --> 39:34.706
Alex!

39:36.675 --> 39:40.111
No, no, no, no, no, no.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.448
Somebody, call an ambulance!

39:42.481 --> 39:43.715
Call 9-1-1 now!

39:43.749 --> 39:46.184
Alex, it's okay, Alex.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.553
Alex, look at me.

39:47.586 --> 39:50.088
It's okay, sweetheart,
stay with me.

39:50.121 --> 39:52.090
Stay with me, Alex,
they're coming right now.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.124
You're going
to be okay.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.594
Alex, you're going
to be okay.
Look at me.

39:55.627 --> 39:58.430
You're going to be just fine.
You're going to be just fine.

39:58.464 --> 39:59.498
Now just stay with me.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.839
Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex,
it's okay.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.941
Look at me.
Look at me.

40:09.975 --> 40:12.010
Look at me. Look at me.

40:24.856 --> 40:27.793
( phone ringing in distance )

40:53.084 --> 40:55.220
We get a trial date yet
on that Richmond case?

40:55.253 --> 40:56.655
It's postponed.

40:56.688 --> 40:57.789
We're gonna lose
that witness.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.024
She was already
shaky to begin with.

40:59.057 --> 41:00.258
Well, nothing we can do.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.762
You got SVU cases being handled
by ADAs from other bureaus.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.665
They don't give a damn.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.066
Well, isn't that nice.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.836
What?

41:10.869 --> 41:13.238
Rafael Zapata Gaviria was found
dead in a holding cell

41:13.271 --> 41:14.806
awaiting a hearing.
No witnesses.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.675
There goes Velez's
extradition.

41:16.708 --> 41:19.545
I long for the old days
when the government
would just send in

41:19.578 --> 41:21.146
the Delta Force
assassin squad.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.048
DEA Agent Hammond
wants to see you guys tonight.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.082
There's the address.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.116
STABLER:
What for?

41:25.150 --> 41:27.252
CRAGEN:
Something about
closing out the case.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.530
Nice location.
Convenient.

41:38.564 --> 41:40.131
Sorry. Only way to do this.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.967
Do what?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.936
Wouldn't take no for an answer.
Real pain in the ass, this one.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.851
I am so sorry about all of this.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.192
Your funeral's tomorrow.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.960
And you're both expected
to attend.

42:08.994 --> 42:09.995
For the time being,

42:10.028 --> 42:11.029
Ms. Cabot's
better off dead.

42:11.062 --> 42:13.599
If Velez can get to Zapata,
he can get to her.

42:13.632 --> 42:16.067
Witness protection.

42:16.101 --> 42:20.739
Until Velez is extradited,
or otherwise dealt with.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.842
How long?

42:34.019 --> 42:36.121
MARSHAL:
We're on the move.

42:36.154 --> 42:37.355
Sorry, folks.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.724
( vehicles starting )

42:38.757 --> 42:41.159
Okay,
let's move 'em out!
