( music playing )

00:09.210 --> 00:11.179
( sighing )

00:19.153 --> 00:21.155
( groans )

00:30.798 --> 00:34.502
( gasping, whimpering )

00:40.541 --> 00:41.775
Come on.

00:51.419 --> 00:55.123
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:55.156 --> 00:58.559
and CBS

01:32.260 --> 01:33.093
( laughs )

01:33.127 --> 01:34.662
Yeah, 'cause I always
get that confused.

01:34.695 --> 01:35.763
No, no, it's simple.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.431
If the groundhog
sees his shadow,

01:37.465 --> 01:38.432
six more weeks of winter.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.369
If he doesn't, spring's
right around the corner.

01:41.402 --> 01:44.572
Are you sure that it's not
the other way around.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.407
Trust me, I know what
I'm talking about.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.408
See you later.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.177
Thanks.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.679
All right-- Thursday,
11:00 a.m.

01:51.712 --> 01:52.780
WOMAN:
Sharp.

01:52.813 --> 01:53.847
I'll be there.

01:53.881 --> 01:54.882
You'll make it this time?

01:54.915 --> 01:56.250
( groans ) I promise.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.351
WOMAN:
See you then.

01:57.385 --> 02:00.288
You okay?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.922
Yeah.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.257
No.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.792
I hate going
to the dentist.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.660
I've had a phobia
since I was a child

02:06.694 --> 02:08.662
and now I need a root canal.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.299
Mm.
That doesn't sound like fun.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.501
No, I've canceled
my appointment three times.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.836
What's not fun?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.771
Nothing.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.177
Who's Dr. Jackson?

02:23.211 --> 02:25.446
You read that upside down?

02:25.479 --> 02:26.814
A talent that serves me well.
What's wrong with you?

02:26.847 --> 02:29.483
Uh... he-he's
a dentist.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.853
Ooh, and our Ms. Todd
is afraid of dentists.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.488
Who told you that?

02:34.522 --> 02:35.656
Ethically, I can't
reveal my source.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.391
It's the same person
who told me

02:37.425 --> 02:39.460
Probie wasn't potty-
trained till he was six.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.395
Get the sedan, McGee.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.896
Uh, where
we going, boss?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.965
Not we. You.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.567
Apartment building
in Georgetown.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.668
A woman reported

02:47.701 --> 02:50.204
seeing a sailor
being strangled.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.872
Me, uh, alone?

02:51.905 --> 02:53.574
Metro police don't
think it's anything,

02:53.607 --> 02:54.908
but the woman's insistent.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.844
Um, what do you
want me to do?

02:56.877 --> 02:57.845
GIBBS:
Investigate, McGee.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.880
It's what we do.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.782
If there's anything, call in.

03:01.815 --> 03:02.950
McGEE:
Right.

03:09.823 --> 03:10.991
Our little boy's growing up.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.593
Cut it out, DiNozzo.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.827
It's a vote of confidence.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.397
Really? You think so?

03:16.430 --> 03:17.998
It's a test.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.933
Don't listen to him.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.777
( both chuckling )

03:40.788 --> 03:41.755
Excuse me, sir.

03:41.789 --> 03:42.823
Yeah?

03:42.856 --> 03:44.758
NCIS.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.760
Special Agent McGee.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.028
So you're what they sent me.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.797
Geez, I'm feelin' old.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.898
NCIS is here.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.833
Say good-bye
to the little lady.

03:52.866 --> 03:53.867
OFFICER:
Copy that.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.403
Uh, so, uh...

03:55.436 --> 03:57.338
what have you got?

03:57.371 --> 03:59.473
There's no need
to write it down, kid.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.609
Woman up there says
that she saw a sailor

04:01.642 --> 04:03.311
being strangled
across the way.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.745
Never happened.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.881
You checked it out?

04:07.915 --> 04:08.782
( chuckling )

04:08.816 --> 04:11.051
Yeah, the apartment
manager let us in.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.620
No sign of struggle,

04:12.653 --> 04:13.721
nobody was even there.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.988
No forcible entry.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.758
Neighbors didn't
see or hear anything.

04:17.791 --> 04:21.429
So why did you call us?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.464
She wouldn't let it go.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.567
I think she was up a
little bit too late.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.602
Had a little
too much to drink, you know?

04:28.636 --> 04:29.737
Look, I got some other

04:29.770 --> 04:31.739
real cases
to investigate.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.807
Her name is Erin Kendall.
Apartment 2-B.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.909
Make sure you ask her
to show you the video.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.711
( chuckles )

04:49.990 --> 04:52.793
Hi.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.662
Hi.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.063
Uh, you're the cop from NCIS?

04:56.096 --> 04:57.731
Special Agent McGee.

04:57.765 --> 05:00.100
Come on in;
maybe I can

05:00.133 --> 05:01.535
get somewhere with you.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.944
Well, by the time I started
to record, they were gone.

05:10.978 --> 05:14.014
And, yes, I'd had a few
glasses of wine, but I saw

05:14.047 --> 05:15.983
a sailor being strangled.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.551
You're sure
it was a sailor?

05:17.585 --> 05:19.887
Yes, he was wearing
his service dress blues.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.990
I work for DOD.
I know military uniforms.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.597
( groans )

05:33.033 --> 05:36.770
Infinite-Dimensional
Homological Algebra

05:36.804 --> 05:38.672
for Binary Systems.

05:38.706 --> 05:39.707
You read this?

05:39.740 --> 05:40.774
Oh, yeah.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.744
I had the author, Sidnitski,
in graduate school.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.379
You went to MIT?

05:45.413 --> 05:46.414
Yes.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.015
Me, too.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.917
( anxious laugh )

05:51.919 --> 05:53.921
The root canal?

05:55.489 --> 05:58.125
I have an appointment with
the dentist in the morning.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.693
You gonna keep it this time?

06:03.497 --> 06:06.066
TONY:
I can help you.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.536
I have a friend
who had a fear of flying.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.003
He was cured by a hypnotist.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.172
A hypnotist.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.407
I don't think so.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.708
( phone rings )

06:14.742 --> 06:16.109
Yeah, Gibbs.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.578
Boss, it's McGee.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.946
Yeah?

06:18.979 --> 06:21.181
I think there may be
something here.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.483
You think?

06:22.516 --> 06:24.017
Well, uh...

06:24.051 --> 06:25.185
Do we roll

06:25.218 --> 06:26.487
or not, McGee?

06:34.928 --> 06:36.964
Roll, boss.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.169
DiNozzo.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.504
Get the truck.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.185
Ah, is that the witness?

06:58.218 --> 07:00.087
Yeah, Tony.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.088
Crime scene?

07:01.121 --> 07:04.057
Uh, second floor of this
apartment building here.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.460
Occupant is a civilian
named Thorne.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.662
Robert J.
He's not at home.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.230
Let's check it out.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.567
I hope you have more to go on
than her sweet smile.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.609
The police already
checked this out.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.677
Thorne's one of my best tenants.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.212
I don't want
to lose him.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.949
This gonna take
you guys long?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.784
I got a meeting with my
doctoral committee, here.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.486
When was the last time

07:32.520 --> 07:33.587
you saw Mr. Thorne?

07:33.621 --> 07:35.155
I don't know.
About a week ago?

07:35.188 --> 07:37.257
He travels a lot.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.693
We can let ourselves out.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.698
GIBBS:
You made the call.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.800
What were you basing
your decision on?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.836
The credibility of the witness.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.938
MIT graduate.
Phi Beta Kappa.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.173
Builds computer
models for DOD.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.242
We've all seen
the credentials.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.610
That's it?

07:56.644 --> 07:57.978
No, no, uh,

07:58.011 --> 07:59.780
to get a closer
look at the assault,

07:59.813 --> 08:00.781
Erin used a camcorder

08:00.814 --> 08:02.916
with a 200-to-one zoom lens.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.251
Let's see the video.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.287
Well, she didn't actually,
uh, start recording

08:07.320 --> 08:09.757
until after the men had
moved away from the window,

08:09.790 --> 08:11.258
but it does show that
the lights were on.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.259
When the Metro Police

08:12.292 --> 08:13.961
got here, they were off.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.096
That would
do it for me.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.766
Boss, the truth?

08:18.799 --> 08:21.869
That would be good.

08:21.902 --> 08:25.072
If there's one thing
I've learned from you,

08:25.105 --> 08:28.809
it's that sometimes an agent
has to go with their gut.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.946
Okay.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.782
What would you do now, McGee?

08:37.217 --> 08:39.119
I'll dust
for prints.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.688
I'll shoot.

08:40.721 --> 08:44.792
We're not going to spend
a lot of time on this.

08:48.328 --> 08:51.164
I can't work like this, McGee.
Get off my back.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.166
Sorry.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.735
It's just,
everything is riding on you

08:54.768 --> 08:56.269
finding something
that places a sailor

08:56.303 --> 08:57.871
in that apartment.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.206
I wish I were a magician.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.909
DiNozzo says
the boss is testing me.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.076
DiNozzo says a lot of things.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.077
Actually, this time

09:04.111 --> 09:05.913
he's probably right.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.916
Gibbs tested me.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.284
Really?
Yeah.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.953
What happened?
Nothing.

09:12.986 --> 09:13.721
I passed.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.056
Your problem is,
the crime scene--

09:16.089 --> 09:18.659
if it really is a crime scene--

09:18.692 --> 09:19.827
is too clean.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.094
It didn't produce
any quality prints.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.865
Abby, it is a crime scene.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.801
Then it is.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.837
Now get out of here
and let me finish my work.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.806
Thank you, Abs.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.844
Photos from

09:36.877 --> 09:38.779
the scene of the crime.

09:44.852 --> 09:48.021
Annual performance reviews
are next week.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.192
Two sailors
in the National

09:52.225 --> 09:54.361
Capital Region
were reported UA today.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.796
One female.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.297
I'm getting the particulars
on the other.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.032
( phone ringing )

09:59.066 --> 10:01.001
McGee.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.269
ABBY:
Good news, I think.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.004
Did you get a match?

10:04.037 --> 10:06.039
Put her on
the speaker.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.041
I ran the only clean print

10:08.075 --> 10:09.777
from the apartment through AFIS.

10:09.810 --> 10:13.714
It belongs to Petty Officer
First Class Keith Dillon, USN.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.884
He your missing sailor, Kate?

10:16.917 --> 10:19.219
Dillon comma Keith.
Sure is.

10:20.888 --> 10:21.889
Boss...

10:21.922 --> 10:23.356
boss, Erin was right.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.992
GIBBS:
What does that
mean, McGee?

10:25.025 --> 10:27.795
Well, she wasn't
imagining it.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.931
It also means a sailor
may be dead.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.343
Keith Dillon,

10:43.376 --> 10:45.412
32, single, never married.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.247
Lives in Anacostia.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.749
Assigned
to Pax River.
What's he do?

10:48.782 --> 10:50.417
Motor pool. Driver.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.119
I talked to Dillon's CO.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.020
He's still a no-show.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.387
We're going back
to Thorne's apartment.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.655
I'll get the truck.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.127
You did want me
to get the truck, yes?

11:11.739 --> 11:15.275
I'm going to enjoy this.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.010
ERIN:
The attacker's back

11:17.044 --> 11:19.780
was to me most of the time.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.415
Like this?

11:22.449 --> 11:25.385
Yeah, and then he pulled
the sailor off, to your right.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.120
TONY ( over radio ):
Gosh, I can't tell you

11:27.154 --> 11:28.789
how may times
I've thought of doing this.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.490
I dare you, DiNozzo.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.259
Oh, yeah?

11:32.292 --> 11:33.927
( both grunting )

11:35.462 --> 11:37.731
KATE:
DiNozzo!

11:37.765 --> 11:38.799
( groaning )

11:41.068 --> 11:44.805
That's just what
it looked like.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.339
( choking )

11:48.809 --> 11:50.844
( groaning )

11:54.447 --> 11:58.118
There are so many things
I could say right now.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.422
Probie.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.058
Get the ALS up here.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.507
Yeah, it's urine.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.775
McGEE:
Boss...

12:21.809 --> 12:24.077
Tenant does not
appear to have a pet.

12:24.111 --> 12:27.781
Have Abby do a DNA analysis.

12:27.815 --> 12:30.884
In the meantime, we go over
this place, top to bottom.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.853
I'll get the equipment.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.323
Excuse me.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.528
I want all
the information

12:41.561 --> 12:43.563
you have
on your tenant, Thorne.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.498
Contact numbers,
place of employment,

12:45.532 --> 12:47.234
apartment lease,
everything.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.135
I'm just the manager.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.170
I call a plumber
when the toilet backs up.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.906
The building's owned by Hawley
Street Holding in Boston.

12:52.940 --> 12:53.907
They got all that.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.375
Get it for me.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.483
Did you find anything?

13:03.516 --> 13:04.484
Urine. On the carpet.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.220
Urine?!

13:07.254 --> 13:08.388
Evacuation.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.058
When somebody dies, their
sphincter and bladder relax.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.861
Probably more than
she wants to know, McGee.

13:13.894 --> 13:17.264
Special Agent Gibbs
believe me now?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.298
More than he did before.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.299
McGee!

13:19.332 --> 13:20.167
I'll... I'll...

13:20.200 --> 13:21.969
let you know what's
going on, okay?

13:22.002 --> 13:23.036
Okay.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.457
Clear.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.595
Boss, I already vacuumed
the couch for fibers.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.864
It's a convertible sofa, McGee.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.333
Slept on one for seven months.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.036
That would be
after the third wife?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.006
That would be
none of my business.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.525
( camera shutter clicking )

14:23.096 --> 14:24.197
( camera shutter clicking )

14:25.198 --> 14:28.535
The missing Mr. Thorne
is even more mysterious.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.303
And dangerous.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.943
What do you think
was in there?

14:35.976 --> 14:39.412
Drugs?

14:39.446 --> 14:40.413
( camera clicking )

14:40.447 --> 14:43.650
Oh, um, Hawley Street
Holding faxed over a copy

14:43.683 --> 14:47.287
of Thorne's lease agreement
and rental application.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.956
You're gonna need
Thorne's permission

14:48.989 --> 14:50.257
if you want
to remove property.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.526
When he shows up,
tell him to call me.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.062
Well, I'm gonna
need a receipt.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.140
( Tony whistles )

15:07.174 --> 15:08.608
You can handle
something that big?

15:08.641 --> 15:10.710
You'd be surprised
at what I can handle.
Really!

15:10.743 --> 15:13.947
Now, you think I could
drive a truck like this?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.215
Not much I can tell you.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.216
Petty Officer Dillon

15:16.249 --> 15:17.484
did his job
and that's about it.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.220
Didn't hang around.
Didn't socialize.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.421
He ever been late
before?

15:21.454 --> 15:22.990
No, this is a first.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.657
I waited till noon
to report him UA.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.694
He ever mention
a man named Thorne?

15:27.727 --> 15:30.130
Not that I remember.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.999
What's happened?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.666
Dillon's only been UA
a couple hours,

15:33.700 --> 15:35.035
and NCIS is involved?

15:35.068 --> 15:36.303
According to
his service records,

15:36.336 --> 15:38.972
Petty Officer Dillon
washed out of SEAL training.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.141
Yeah, I heard
he rang the bell.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.976
Agent Gibbs,
I'm his CO.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.045
I want to know
what's going on.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.749
We have a report
of a sailor being strangled.

15:49.782 --> 15:53.386
And you think it was
Petty Officer Dillon?

15:53.420 --> 15:55.755
We found his prints
at the scene.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.190
No body.

15:57.224 --> 16:00.060
That's all I can tell you.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.735
GIBBS:
Hey!

16:08.768 --> 16:09.769
DiNozzo!

16:09.802 --> 16:11.238
I gotta go.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.373
Check you later.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.008
Get her number?

16:15.042 --> 16:16.443
I wasn't hitting on her,

16:16.476 --> 16:18.145
and neither was
Petty Officer Dillon.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.579
She was interested
in him, but uh,

16:19.612 --> 16:20.647
he has a girlfriend.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.648
Did you get her name?

16:21.681 --> 16:24.417
Meg. Fits a hot
chick like that.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.485
( groans )

16:25.518 --> 16:26.786
You meant
Dillon's girlfriend.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.788
Check out his
place in Anacostia.

16:28.821 --> 16:29.489
ABBY:
I enjoy going
to the dentist.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.691
What could you
possibly enjoy?

16:31.724 --> 16:34.327
A little pain is
a good thing, Kate.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.696
That's why people put
hot sauce on tacos.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.598
What'd the urine tell you, Abby?

16:38.631 --> 16:39.632
Oh, all kinds of stuff.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.301
We had a really good talk.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.272
I was able to extract
epithelialcells.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.607
It's human urine, Boss.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.109
What else?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.810
No recreational drugs.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.079
Not diabetic.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.080
Male or female?

16:53.113 --> 16:54.747
Wasn't pregnant.
DNA?

16:54.781 --> 16:56.749
You're never satisfied,
are you?

16:56.783 --> 16:58.151
I'm working on it

16:58.185 --> 16:59.652
and the ballistics
from Thorne's gun.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.653
But I found
something interesting

17:00.687 --> 17:02.289
in the mattress cutout--
Do you wanna come see?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.624
I'll be down
in a minute.
Okay.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.426
I need an assistant.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.361
It's not in the budget.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.731
The name Robert J. Thorne
has to be an alias.

17:11.764 --> 17:14.467
Nothing on his
apartment rental
application checks out.

17:14.501 --> 17:18.071
His driver's license,
social, references
are all phony.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.839
He lists his occupation
as a "sales representative"

17:19.872 --> 17:20.907
but the company doesn't exist.

17:20.940 --> 17:24.111
The owners of the building
didn't verify anything?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.546
He paid the first month,
last month,

17:26.579 --> 17:29.082
and every payment since in cash.

17:29.116 --> 17:30.317
Apparently,
dead presidents

17:30.350 --> 17:31.784
are the only
reference they needed.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.855
Ran the serial number
on Thorne's Sig

17:35.888 --> 17:37.690
by the manufacturer.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.726
It was sold, 15 months ago,
to a Virginia dealer.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.494
He works gun shows.
Trying to track him down.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.296
What'd you find?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.732
Couldn't tell when
Petty Officer Dillon

17:45.765 --> 17:46.833
was last in his apartment.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.802
The bed wasn't made, but
from the looks of the place,

17:49.836 --> 17:50.670
it never is.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.871
GIBBS:
What about the
girlfriend?

17:51.904 --> 17:52.805
Ah. Indications are

17:52.839 --> 17:55.308
they're in the
not-ready-to-commit stage.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.743
Indications...?

17:56.776 --> 17:57.710
Yeah, she keeps
her cosmetics

17:57.744 --> 17:58.711
and her toothbrush there,
but no clothes.

17:58.745 --> 18:03.550
And they are intimate...
but not at the moment.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.717
( laughs )

18:04.751 --> 18:07.320
Okay, now how
would you know that?

18:07.354 --> 18:08.888
Gyne-Lotrimin.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.191
TONY:
Jill Meyers

18:11.224 --> 18:13.193
has a yeast infection.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.295
I'm gonna call the pharmacy
and get her address.

18:16.696 --> 18:21.534
You may not admire his methods,
but you gotta love the results.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.735
I'm with Abby.

18:23.836 --> 18:24.737
Uh, boss, can I come?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.806
Come on.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.713
What do you got, Abbs?

18:36.249 --> 18:37.384
Do I have to
answer the newbie?

18:37.417 --> 18:38.385
Humor him.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.353
ABBY:
There were traces

18:40.387 --> 18:41.521
of cocaine found
inside the box.

18:41.554 --> 18:45.225
So, Tony was right.
He wa dealing drugs.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.394
Maybe not.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.662
The traces were microscopic.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.431
So it could just be
from hiding money.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.634
He calls himself
a federal agent.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.868
The U.S. money supply

18:55.902 --> 18:57.804
is contaminated
with traces of cocaine.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.806
I thought that
was an urban myth.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.274
Give me a bill.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.342
Huh?

19:02.375 --> 19:03.310
Give me a bill.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.817
A hundred?

19:10.850 --> 19:12.552
Yeah.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.753
I like... like
to be prepared,

19:13.786 --> 19:14.887
for any emergency.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.756
You're such a Boy Scout.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.426
Money is a great receptor.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.628
Because the ink
never really dries.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.531
One bill used
to snort cocaine,

19:24.564 --> 19:25.665
and then going
through an ATM

19:25.698 --> 19:28.668
leaves minute traces of the drug
on thousands of others.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.870
Four out of five bills
in circulation

19:30.903 --> 19:32.372
are contaminated
to a level

19:32.405 --> 19:33.773
that can be detected
by drug dogs.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.480
Um, Abs?

19:40.513 --> 19:41.481
Yeah?

19:41.514 --> 19:42.882
Forgetting something?

19:42.915 --> 19:44.884
No.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.353
Hey, McGee!

19:50.457 --> 19:51.558
( phone rings )

19:53.926 --> 19:55.828
One sec.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.364
Special Agent McGee.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.266
Hey, kid.
This is Detective Floyd.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.334
We found something
you might be interested in.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.436
Step out of there.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.281
I knew Erin saw
what she saw.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.549
That feeling in my gut
was right.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.251
That feeling you experienced

20:18.285 --> 20:20.453
was lower than
your gut, probie.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.726
( camera shutter clicking )

20:28.928 --> 20:29.996
( camera shutter clicking )

20:30.029 --> 20:30.997
Whew!

20:31.030 --> 20:32.632
All right, Ducky, you're up.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.501
Thanks, Caitlin.

20:34.534 --> 20:35.868
I'd have to be
really desperate

20:35.902 --> 20:37.270
to use one
of these things.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.539
Yeah. Wretched,
aren't they?

20:39.572 --> 20:40.740
Looks like
your missing sailor

20:40.773 --> 20:42.609
was dumped here
over the weekend.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.712
His watch and his
wallet are missing.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.979
Killer didn't
know he was seen

20:47.013 --> 20:48.681
strangling
Petty Officer Dillon.

20:48.715 --> 20:49.816
He made it look
like a mugging.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.318
DETECTIVE FLOYD:
Makes sense.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.320
Any luck tracking
Thorne down?

20:53.353 --> 20:55.888
Name's an alias.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.857
The kid's got
good instincts,
you know.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.659
Yeah, you think
so, huh?

20:59.692 --> 21:00.560
Mm-hmm.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.761
McGee!

21:01.794 --> 21:03.330
Yeah!

21:03.363 --> 21:04.731
You leave my coffee
in the truck?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.933
Oh, uh, I'm
getting it now, boss.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.869
Keep me posted.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.605
Duck?

21:12.639 --> 21:14.674
Well, based on lividity
and blood-pooling

21:14.707 --> 21:16.776
the body was most
definitely moved.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.077
The ligature marks

21:18.110 --> 21:19.346
indicate strangulation

21:19.379 --> 21:20.880
as the cause of death.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.749
These parallel lines

21:22.782 --> 21:23.850
suggest an electrical cord.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.017
Time of death...

21:27.920 --> 21:30.590
...12 to 14 hours ago.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.591
That would confirm

21:31.624 --> 21:32.659
the witness' story.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.893
Yeah.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.995
Bag his head and
hands, Mr. Palmer.

21:37.830 --> 21:41.801
Hey, you want to help me
with the grid?

21:41.834 --> 21:43.670
( groaning )

21:43.703 --> 21:46.673
Give me
the hypnotist's number.

21:46.706 --> 21:49.509
Here you go, boss.

21:51.711 --> 21:54.781
What's next?

21:54.814 --> 21:55.982
What?

21:56.015 --> 21:58.818
How do we proceed, McGee?

21:58.851 --> 22:00.953
Right.

22:02.855 --> 22:06.393
McGEE:
Well, uh, we've got
to figure out who Thorne is

22:06.426 --> 22:07.293
and find the connection

22:07.326 --> 22:09.762
between him
and Petty Officer Dillon.

22:09.796 --> 22:10.930
Probably the money.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.098
And I think it would be

22:12.131 --> 22:13.666
a smart move to keep an eye

22:13.700 --> 22:14.734
on Thorne's apartment.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.469
If he doesn't know
we're on to him, he'll be back.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.904
What else?

22:17.937 --> 22:18.938
I think Erin

22:18.971 --> 22:20.373
and the building manager

22:20.407 --> 22:22.775
should work on
a composite sketch.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.577
Am I forgetting anything?

22:24.611 --> 22:27.980
Just to keep
my coffee hot, McGee.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.125
Would you bring me
an evidence vial,

22:39.158 --> 22:41.561
please, Mr. Palmer?

22:42.595 --> 22:45.465
This fiber appears synthetic.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.966
Most likely the petty officer

22:46.999 --> 22:50.437
didn't pick it up
from the portable loo.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.906
You know, making your
death appear a robbery

22:53.940 --> 22:57.577
was a very amateurish attempt
at a red herring.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.679
I've always found that
a very curious expression.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.847
Yes, it is, isn't it?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.649
You know the derivation?

23:02.682 --> 23:04.517
Fox and hounds.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.653
How's that, Dr. Mallard?

23:06.686 --> 23:09.956
Well, the only practical way
to cure a herring

23:09.989 --> 23:12.659
is by smoking and salting.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.661
Yes, it turns the
fish a crimson red

23:14.694 --> 23:17.497
and gives it
a very distinctive smell.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.998
In the early 15th century,

23:19.031 --> 23:22.902
they used to train their hounds
to hunt foxes

23:22.935 --> 23:25.004
by dragging a red herring
along the ground

23:25.037 --> 23:26.706
on a piece of string

23:26.739 --> 23:29.141
to leave a trail of scent
for the dogs to follow.

23:29.175 --> 23:32.011
Then, later on,
they would drag a red herring

23:32.044 --> 23:34.547
across the scent trail
of a real fox

23:34.581 --> 23:39.986
to test the dog's ability
to ignore a false scent

23:40.019 --> 23:41.954
or false clue.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.458
Hence the term "red herring"
became to mean "a false clue

23:45.492 --> 23:47.727
designed to fool
one's opponent."

23:47.760 --> 23:49.562
That's fascinating.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.797
Yeah.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.568
Thank you.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.570
Do you know the etymology

23:57.604 --> 23:59.906
of the phrase
"white elephant"?

23:59.939 --> 24:02.174
I should really get
this up to Abby...

24:04.210 --> 24:05.912
Oh.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.780
Because of its rarity,

24:07.814 --> 24:10.483
the King of Siam
declared all white elephants

24:10.517 --> 24:12.619
his personal property.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.588
( two gunshots )

24:15.622 --> 24:17.957
( gunshot )

24:22.595 --> 24:23.596
How's that?

24:23.630 --> 24:25.097
Yes. Excellent.

24:26.933 --> 24:30.770
( Erin talking quietly )

24:31.804 --> 24:33.640
( Erin giggling )

24:33.673 --> 24:37.009
This is as far as you've gotten?

24:37.043 --> 24:39.946
Uh, yeah, that's as far
as we're going to get.

24:39.979 --> 24:40.847
I'm sorry.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.650
I just can't remember
what he looks like.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.284
Show her the composite
the manager did.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.219
McGEE:
I did. It's a waste of time.

24:47.253 --> 24:48.721
It could've been anyone.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.957
Let me try something.
Okay.

24:52.592 --> 24:55.061
What are you doing?

24:55.094 --> 24:57.029
Erin is incredible.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.031
She has rewritten
the software code

24:59.065 --> 25:01.133
to the MAU program to
incorporate hyper-threading.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.202
But I thought you were working
on the composite.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.937
It's not going to happen.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.172
Erin,

25:06.205 --> 25:09.008
any idea on how to over-clock
the processors?

25:09.041 --> 25:10.943
Yeah, um, you got two options.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.212
Changing either the FSB
or the multiplier locks.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.549
Oh. A gift from
Dr. Mallard.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.051
( Erin and McGee
continue talking )

25:21.087 --> 25:23.055
( Erin laughing )

25:23.089 --> 25:25.324
ERIN:
There it is.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.759
That's amazing.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.806
KATE:
Jill Meyers?

25:41.173 --> 25:42.308
NCIS.

25:42.341 --> 25:44.310
Special Agent Todd,
DiNozzo.

25:44.343 --> 25:45.678
TONY:
We'd like to talk to you

25:45.712 --> 25:46.946
about a Petty Officer
Keith Dillon.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.784
When's the last time
you saw him?

25:52.819 --> 25:54.687
A couple days ago.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.889
So how did you find out
that I know Keith?

25:56.923 --> 25:59.125
Did he... he tell you?

26:00.159 --> 26:03.029
Petty Officer Dillon
has been murdered.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.133
What?

26:08.167 --> 26:10.069
( sniffles )

26:11.103 --> 26:13.673
What happened?

26:13.706 --> 26:15.341
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.376
How long have you
and Petty Officer Dillon been

26:17.409 --> 26:18.978
seeing each other?

26:19.011 --> 26:20.747
Keith came in
a couple months ago.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.315
So he's dead?

26:23.349 --> 26:24.817
Yeah.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.185
You're married.

26:28.220 --> 26:31.090
Uh, yeah.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.659
Your husband
know about Keith?

26:32.692 --> 26:33.960
Uh-uh.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.663
He's, uh, he's in Iraq.

26:36.696 --> 26:37.997
Been there eight months.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.999
Any way he could've found out?

26:40.032 --> 26:41.367
Uh-uh.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.236
Were things getting
serious with Keith?

26:44.270 --> 26:45.838
I was going to send my husband
an e-mail...

26:45.872 --> 26:48.040
breaking up.

26:48.074 --> 26:51.177
Good thing I didn't.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.980
Keith wanted me to quit my job

26:54.013 --> 26:56.348
and move in with him.

26:56.382 --> 26:57.316
He was going
to support you?

26:57.349 --> 26:58.718
Yeah.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.753
He was coming
into a lot of money.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.322
Guess I'm stuck here, now.

27:03.355 --> 27:06.759
Keith ever talk about a guy
named Robert Thorne?

27:06.793 --> 27:08.360
Keith didn't talk
about anything.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.898
Our relationship was more,
mm... physical

27:11.931 --> 27:13.332
than anything else.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.367
I do know he was pissed

27:15.401 --> 27:17.904
he didn't make it
as a Navy SEAL.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.272
Anything else?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.208
Mm...

27:22.241 --> 27:27.213
My husband doesn't need
to find out about Keith, right?

27:29.148 --> 27:30.883
( quietly ):
A "Dear John" by e-mail?!

27:30.917 --> 27:32.384
What a calculating witch.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.452
She gives all
women a bad name.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.754
I'm never getting married.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.455
There's no upside to it.
That's not true.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.457
Statistically,
married men live longer.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.726
They don't actually
live longer--

27:39.759 --> 27:40.893
it just seems longer.

27:40.927 --> 27:41.894
You're so cynical.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.295
Am I? Marriage
was never intended

27:43.329 --> 27:44.997
to last
more than a few years.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.398
Where did you get that?

27:46.432 --> 27:47.466
Anthropology 101.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.201
The concept
was invented by cavemen

27:49.235 --> 27:50.903
with a life expectancy
of 25 years.

27:50.937 --> 27:53.405
"Till death do us part"
meant four or five years, tops.

27:53.439 --> 27:54.807
( chuckles )

27:54.841 --> 27:57.376
That was very
enlightening, DiNozzo.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.078
And I do understand now.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.113
You think like
a Neanderthal.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.416
( laughs softly )

28:04.450 --> 28:08.420
( loud music playing )

28:16.428 --> 28:18.064
( turns music off )

28:18.097 --> 28:19.231
Hey!

28:19.265 --> 28:20.266
Geez!

28:20.299 --> 28:21.433
Don't mess
with my music.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.434
How do you work
with that?

28:22.468 --> 28:23.402
It helps me to
concentrate.

28:23.435 --> 28:24.771
On what?

28:24.804 --> 28:27.106
Fibers that Ducky
found on Dillon.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.941
Definitely from
the trunk lining
of a car.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.376
I'm going to run them

28:30.409 --> 28:31.443
through the FBI's
MAU database

28:31.477 --> 28:33.780
and try to narrow it down
to make, model and year.

28:33.813 --> 28:34.413
What's this?

28:34.446 --> 28:35.815
Thorne's original Virginia

28:35.848 --> 28:37.449
gun-purchase application
for his Sig.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.118
See if you can lift
a print off it.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.519
( Gibbs turns on loud music )

28:40.552 --> 28:42.421
As soon as
I am finished with this.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.824
No, Abby, do it now.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.968
I have a dentist appointment
tomorrow morning.

28:56.002 --> 28:57.336
You see the hypnotist?

28:57.369 --> 28:58.771
You weren't going
to tell me.

28:58.805 --> 28:59.939
I don't like crutches.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.507
I hope you never break a leg.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.444
Who's sitting
Thorne's apartment?

29:05.477 --> 29:06.445
Special Agent Balboa.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.047
I'm on my way to relieve him.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.248
Did you find the girlfriend?

29:09.281 --> 29:10.316
KATE:
She's a piece of work,

29:10.349 --> 29:12.484
but we did find...
It's all about
the money, boss.

29:12.518 --> 29:15.221
Petty Officer Dillon told his
girlfriend he was gonna be rich.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.189
A career E-6?

29:17.223 --> 29:18.858
It wasn't
coming from the Navy.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.160
We figure Thorne
killed him for the money.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.461
You think?

29:22.494 --> 29:23.996
What are you thinking?

29:24.030 --> 29:26.065
Where's the money?

29:26.098 --> 29:28.300
Thorne took it.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.501
Why'd he leave his weapon?

29:29.535 --> 29:31.070
He's coming back.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.543
ERIN:
Well, I am fascinated.

29:37.576 --> 29:40.246
You have multiple degrees,

29:40.279 --> 29:42.348
including computer science
from MIT.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.484
How did you end up
a federal agent?

29:45.517 --> 29:47.820
( over phone ):
Uh...

29:47.854 --> 29:49.588
it was, uh, by design.

29:49.621 --> 29:53.192
I always wanted
to be in law enforcement.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.161
I never thought
I'd be talking like this

29:55.194 --> 29:56.863
with someone who carries a gun.

29:56.896 --> 29:57.997
( chuckles )

29:58.030 --> 29:59.365
( giggles )

29:59.398 --> 30:01.400
( rustling, clattering )

30:05.071 --> 30:07.039
Erin?

30:07.073 --> 30:08.374
Hold on.

30:08.407 --> 30:09.575
What is it?

30:09.608 --> 30:12.879
( clattering )

30:12.912 --> 30:14.546
I'll be right back.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.015
Okay.

30:16.048 --> 30:18.918
( clattering continues )

30:21.487 --> 30:24.556
( clicking )

30:25.591 --> 30:27.026
( doorknob rattling )

30:29.896 --> 30:32.464
( panicked panting )

30:36.602 --> 30:40.539
There's... somebody's trying
to break into my apartment.

30:40.572 --> 30:41.974
I'll be right there.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.342
( Erin screaming )

30:43.375 --> 30:44.443
( Erin cries out )

30:44.476 --> 30:46.378
( Erin choking )

30:46.412 --> 30:48.347
Don't hang up. I'm coming.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.482
( strained grunting )

31:02.294 --> 31:05.231
( panting )

31:09.268 --> 31:10.970
( glass shattering )

31:11.971 --> 31:14.640
( gunshots )

31:23.615 --> 31:24.616
( blowing air )

31:26.518 --> 31:28.554
( grunts )

31:36.128 --> 31:37.063
( indistinct radio
communication )

31:37.096 --> 31:39.298
You'll be fine.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.701
FLOYD:
The boy witnessed the murder?

31:42.734 --> 31:43.802
( camera clicking )

31:43.835 --> 31:46.172
GIBBS:
He was staked-out
in Thorne's apartment.

31:46.205 --> 31:49.041
Could he pick the killer
out of a line-up?

31:49.075 --> 31:50.076
You have a suspect?

31:50.109 --> 31:51.143
No.

31:51.177 --> 31:52.979
But if I did, I'd like
to find out if your boy...

31:53.012 --> 31:55.147
His name is
Special Agent McGee.

31:55.181 --> 31:56.515
If Special Agent McGee

31:56.548 --> 31:59.151
could make a positive I.D.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.253
Get a suspect
and we'll find out.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.622
I'll secure
the crime scene.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.324
My M.E. will be here
in about ten min...

32:05.357 --> 32:06.425
She was my witness.

32:06.458 --> 32:09.996
This is still my case.

32:10.029 --> 32:13.232
A civilian kills
another civilian?

32:13.265 --> 32:15.701
I do not think so.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.537
Nobody gets in here
but our forensic team.

32:18.570 --> 32:19.671
Mm-hmm. Right.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.673
( distant siren wailing )

32:23.075 --> 32:25.077
( indistinct conversations,
radio communications )

32:27.213 --> 32:29.381
Hey.

32:36.322 --> 32:39.458
I should have been watching
from Erin's apartment.

32:39.491 --> 32:43.529
No. You were exactly where
you were supposed to be, McGee.

32:47.599 --> 32:50.436
( sighs )

32:50.469 --> 32:52.371
I saw Erin lying there,

32:52.404 --> 32:55.174
and I rushed in
without clearing the room.

32:58.110 --> 33:01.213
He hit me from behind
with something.

33:01.247 --> 33:05.051
A lamp.

33:05.084 --> 33:07.753
McGEE:
I should have got him.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.655
KATE:
You tried.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.524
I tried to save Erin,
and I didn't.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.027
I tried to shoot her killer,

33:15.061 --> 33:16.228
and I missed.

33:16.262 --> 33:21.200
Her death is not
your fault, Tim.

33:21.233 --> 33:25.037
All I can see is Erin
lying on the floor.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.715
A shot woke me up, and...

33:36.748 --> 33:38.184
I looked out the window,

33:38.217 --> 33:40.819
and I saw a guy
in a dark jumpsuit

33:40.852 --> 33:43.555
running towards...
uh, "S" Street.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.159
I'll take over here.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.763
( phone rings )

33:51.797 --> 33:53.299
( phone beeps )

33:53.332 --> 33:54.666
FLOYD:
So, what happened?

33:54.700 --> 33:56.168
What?

33:56.202 --> 33:57.269
I got a match on the slug

33:57.303 --> 33:58.837
that I fired
from the gun found

33:58.870 --> 34:00.072
in Thorne's apartment.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.140
Yeah...?

34:01.173 --> 34:03.209
I ran it through ATF.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.211
It was used
in two unsolved murders.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.445
( beeping )

34:08.514 --> 34:10.682
What's up, boss?

34:10.716 --> 34:13.319
Cancel Ducky.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.388
Let's get out of here.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.326
TONY:
Bowers.
MAN ( on phone ):
Bowers?

34:20.359 --> 34:21.327
TONY:
B-O-W-E-R-S.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.361
MAN:
Got it.

34:22.394 --> 34:23.462
TONY:
Can you fax me

34:23.495 --> 34:24.563
a copy of
the files?

34:24.596 --> 34:27.333
Great.

34:27.366 --> 34:30.336
Thanks, Lieutenant.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.806
Some advice.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.808
You can sit there
and second-guess

34:36.842 --> 34:38.777
what you should
or shouldn't have done

34:38.810 --> 34:40.379
and never get the answer.

34:40.412 --> 34:43.782
Or you can get back on the job
and catch the bastard.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.419
The Sig in Thorne's sofa bed

34:47.453 --> 34:48.320
was used to murder

34:48.354 --> 34:49.888
a Carole Anne VanBuren
in suburban Raleigh

34:49.921 --> 34:52.624
and a Thomas Roy Bowers
in Baltimore.

34:52.658 --> 34:53.759
Any tie between them?

34:53.792 --> 34:55.727
Just the Sig.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.429
VanBuren was involved
in a messy divorce.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.564
Husband's a lot richer
with her dead.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.367
Bowers was a tough union steward
leading a long strike.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.302
Both hits?
Sounds like it.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.304
Have the local LEOs
in Raleigh and Baltimore...

35:05.337 --> 35:06.572
Fax the files?
Already did, boss.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.908
How was the root canal?

35:09.941 --> 35:12.144
Nothing to it.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.712
TONY:
Thanks to...?

35:13.745 --> 35:14.913
You, Tony.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.482
I have to give
you credit,

35:16.515 --> 35:19.451
the hypnotist really worked.

35:19.485 --> 35:20.786
Thank you.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.489
You know, Gibbs,

35:23.522 --> 35:25.924
this hypnotist consults
with police departments

35:25.957 --> 35:27.759
on cases of repressed memory.

35:27.793 --> 35:28.860
She might be able

35:28.894 --> 35:30.662
to help McGee
recall details.

35:30.696 --> 35:31.863
GIBBS:
Yeah?

35:31.897 --> 35:34.400
Why don't we just use
a Ouija board?

35:34.433 --> 35:35.434
( chuckles )

35:35.467 --> 35:36.602
Hypnotism isn't

35:36.635 --> 35:38.837
a parlor game, Gibbs.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.407
GIBBS:
Could have fooled me.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.374
Can we at least try?

35:42.408 --> 35:43.742
No.

35:43.775 --> 35:46.645
Ah, hell, why not?

35:48.814 --> 35:50.916
Boss...

35:50.949 --> 35:53.552
I don't think
I can be hypnotized.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.889
WOMAN:
He's ready.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.391
Now, traumatic memories
are permanent.

35:59.425 --> 36:00.359
The biggest barrier

36:00.392 --> 36:02.328
to recalling them is stress.

36:02.361 --> 36:04.396
Well, McGee was certainly under
a lot of stress last night.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.465
Probie's always
under stress, Kate.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.466
Well, with hypnosis,

36:07.499 --> 36:08.767
we bypass the stress,

36:08.800 --> 36:11.437
go into the subconscious,
where the memories are.

36:11.470 --> 36:14.473
Being here, where the incident
occurred, will help.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.442
So does a good
whack to the head.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.477
May I continue,
Agent Gibbs?

36:24.516 --> 36:26.318
Agent McGee,

36:26.352 --> 36:28.487
when I touch your forehead,
you will open your eyes

36:28.520 --> 36:30.489
and remain fully relaxed.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.990
It'll be last night,

36:32.023 --> 36:35.461
when you were talking to
Erin on your cell phone.

36:35.494 --> 36:38.564
You will see and hear
everything clearly.

36:47.005 --> 36:50.242
What is it?

36:50.276 --> 36:51.843
What's happening?

36:51.877 --> 36:54.380
She's heard a sound.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.415
She's scared.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.750
What is she saying?

36:58.784 --> 37:01.253
McGEE:
She's talking low.

37:01.287 --> 37:03.889
Sounds frightened.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.824
Her exact words.

37:05.857 --> 37:09.361
"Someone's trying to break
into my apartment."

37:09.395 --> 37:10.696
What did you do?

37:10.729 --> 37:12.598
Went to the window.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.733
Do it.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.445
HYPNOTIST:
What do you see?

37:26.478 --> 37:29.781
( Erin screaming, choking )

37:29.815 --> 37:32.684
Erin's being assaulted.

37:32.718 --> 37:35.287
I have to help her.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.789
Just stay with this feeling.

37:37.823 --> 37:41.493
Now, you're looking
at the attacker's face.

37:41.527 --> 37:42.494
Describe it.

37:42.528 --> 37:46.298
( Erin choking )

37:46.332 --> 37:47.566
I can't see it.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.368
How is he dressed?

37:49.401 --> 37:51.970
Jumpsuit.

37:52.003 --> 37:53.972
Hooded jacket.

37:54.005 --> 37:57.042
What else can you see?

37:57.075 --> 37:59.445
His hands...

37:59.478 --> 38:02.381
putting something
around her throat.

38:02.414 --> 38:03.315
( phone rings )

38:03.349 --> 38:05.384
ABBY:
Gibbs.
Hold on.

38:06.585 --> 38:08.554
McGEE:
A watch.

38:08.587 --> 38:11.490
Describe the watch.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.959
Large.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.362
It's on his right wrist.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.565
I've got to help her!

38:19.598 --> 38:20.432
It's all right.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.568
You're going to sit down.

38:22.601 --> 38:25.103
When I touch your forehead,

38:25.136 --> 38:27.506
you will be fully aware.

38:27.539 --> 38:28.440
Your memory

38:28.474 --> 38:31.343
sharp and clear.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.452
Yeah, go ahead.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.588
ABBY ( on phone ):
I don't know what you're doing,

38:42.621 --> 38:44.590
but it can't be more important
that what I've got.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.525
Eh, just say it,
will you, Abbs?

38:46.558 --> 38:48.760
You asked, I lifted.

38:48.794 --> 38:49.828
It wasn't easy,

38:49.861 --> 38:51.062
but got a partial

38:51.096 --> 38:52.531
off Thorne's gun application.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.765
You ran it through AFIS?

38:53.799 --> 38:54.933
I didn't have to.

38:54.966 --> 38:55.801
Why not?

38:55.834 --> 38:57.135
Because I already know

38:57.168 --> 38:59.738
everything that you
need to know about him.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.707
The fingerprint belongs
to Dillon...

39:01.740 --> 39:02.708
( muffled words )

39:02.741 --> 39:06.478
Good work, Abbs.

39:06.512 --> 39:07.813
Can you give us
a minute, please?

39:07.846 --> 39:08.647
HYPNOTIST:
Sure.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.481
No problem.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.587
Abby found Thorne.

39:15.621 --> 39:16.822
Where?

39:16.855 --> 39:19.024
In Ducky's cold storage vault.

39:19.057 --> 39:20.158
TONY:
He's dead?

39:20.191 --> 39:22.528
I don't, I don't understand.

39:22.561 --> 39:26.164
Abby matched a print taken from
Dillon's corpse to one taken

39:26.197 --> 39:28.534
from Thorne's
gun application.

39:28.567 --> 39:31.470
Petty Officer Dillon and
Thorne are the same guy.

39:31.503 --> 39:32.638
Dillon was the hit man?

39:32.671 --> 39:34.039
Probably used
the name Thorne

39:34.072 --> 39:37.175
when he was hired to
kill those two people.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.945
A macho, washed-out SEAL,

39:39.978 --> 39:42.047
trying to prove his worth.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.683
Creates a fictitious persona,
Thorne,

39:44.716 --> 39:46.652
to freelance as a killer.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.086
If there's no Thorne,

39:48.119 --> 39:50.656
who murdered Erin and Dillon?

39:50.689 --> 39:53.492
Whoever stole the money
from the sofa.

39:53.525 --> 39:54.726
( Erin groaning )

39:56.495 --> 39:58.564
Boss...

39:58.597 --> 40:04.402
the killer was wearing
his watch on his right wrist.

40:14.045 --> 40:16.748
JEREMY PRYOR:
Hey, what's going on?

40:19.718 --> 40:21.052
Hey, you guys find Thorne?

40:21.086 --> 40:21.453
Yeah.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.021
We found him.

40:25.591 --> 40:28.460
You bastard. You wear your watch
on your right hand.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.597
A lot of people do.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.131
You have a keys
to Thorne's apartment.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.734
I'm the manager. I got keys
to all the apartments.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.503
GIBBS:
Detective Floyd tell you

40:37.536 --> 40:38.770
that the young woman

40:38.804 --> 40:40.138
across the street
witnessed the murder

40:40.171 --> 40:41.473
in Thorne's apartment?

40:42.941 --> 40:46.545
We're gonna match the fibers
found on Dillon's body

40:46.578 --> 40:48.680
to the trunk fibers
in your car.

40:48.714 --> 40:50.081
What do you think
about that?

40:50.115 --> 40:52.684
( scoffs )

40:55.186 --> 40:56.622
( grunts )

41:01.860 --> 41:02.861
( tires screech )

41:03.829 --> 41:04.996
WOMAN:
What are you doing?!

41:05.030 --> 41:07.465
( tires screech )

41:09.701 --> 41:11.102
( grunts )

41:14.039 --> 41:15.106
No, no, no, don't, don't!

41:15.140 --> 41:16.675
Don't, don't!

41:16.708 --> 41:19.845
( cocks gun )

41:23.181 --> 41:24.816
McGee!

41:26.685 --> 41:27.653
If you're gonna shoot him,

41:27.686 --> 41:29.588
you should've done it
while he was running.

41:29.621 --> 41:33.759
( siren approaching )

41:39.097 --> 41:41.567
Turn over.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.701
( grunts )

41:48.874 --> 41:49.975
KATE:
You are so....

41:50.008 --> 41:51.242
Coordinated?

41:51.276 --> 41:52.811
Adolescent.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.045
I prefer the term "fun-loving."

41:54.079 --> 41:55.246
( peanut clatters )

41:55.280 --> 41:56.047
( laughs )

41:56.982 --> 41:58.116
Oh, hey.

41:58.149 --> 41:59.685
( laughs )
Food fight!

41:59.718 --> 42:01.319
( both laughing )

42:01.352 --> 42:02.220
( Kate screams )

42:02.253 --> 42:03.955
( laughs )

42:03.989 --> 42:04.956
( laughter continues )

42:04.990 --> 42:05.724
Guys.

42:05.757 --> 42:07.759
Guys!

42:07.793 --> 42:09.060
Guys!

42:09.094 --> 42:11.262
( laughter ceases )

42:11.296 --> 42:12.931
Please, I'm trying to write.

42:12.964 --> 42:14.199
KATE:
Sorry, McGee.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.767
TONY:
Need any help?

42:15.801 --> 42:18.103
No, thank you.
Just some quiet.

42:18.136 --> 42:19.738
No problema.

42:19.771 --> 42:20.739
Shh.

42:20.772 --> 42:22.674
( peanut clatters )

42:24.142 --> 42:25.844
( clears throat )

42:25.877 --> 42:28.614
( loudly ):
Remember your fir...

42:28.647 --> 42:29.915
Shh.

42:29.948 --> 42:32.718
( quieter ):
Remember your
first report, Kate?

42:32.751 --> 42:35.186
Yes. Gibbs made me rewrite it.
Twice.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.222
Felt like I was
in grammar school again.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.858
Are you going to pick
up those carrot sticks?

42:39.891 --> 42:41.693
I didn't throw
any carrot sticks.

42:41.727 --> 42:42.861
KATE:
I can't stand working

42:42.894 --> 42:44.763
in a pig sty.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.097
( oinking )

42:46.131 --> 42:47.699
( coughs )

42:47.733 --> 42:49.701
He only made you redo it twice?

42:49.735 --> 42:51.069
I forgot to spell-check.

42:51.102 --> 42:52.838
Huh.

42:52.871 --> 42:54.606
How many times, Tony?

42:54.640 --> 42:56.942
Can I catch a peanut in my mouth
without missing?

42:56.975 --> 42:58.109
Ha.

42:58.143 --> 43:01.680
Did you have to
redo your first
report for Gibbs?

43:01.713 --> 43:02.280
A few.

43:02.313 --> 43:03.281
What's a few?

43:03.314 --> 43:04.850
Five. Would have been more,

43:04.883 --> 43:06.284
but I took pity on him.
Oh.

43:06.317 --> 43:07.919
McGee.

43:07.953 --> 43:09.621
Good job.

43:09.655 --> 43:10.822
Send it up to the director.

43:10.856 --> 43:12.924
Will do, boss.

43:12.958 --> 43:14.893
Any more food fights in here,
I'm joining in-- with peas.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.662
Frozen peas?
Nope.

43:16.695 --> 43:17.729
In the can.
