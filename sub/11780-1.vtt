{\an8}- OH, JESUS.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.054
{\an8}THIS IS GONNA BE INTERESTING.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.724
{\an8}AND NOW I CAN'T STAND HIM.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.476
- YOU TAKE THE TIME
AND LISTEN TO ME,

06:33.559 --> 06:36.062
IT'LL COME OUT
AND BE A GOOD TATTOO.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.647
- THAT'S THE KIND OF
DISRESPECTFUL [bleep] THAT'S--

06:37.730 --> 06:38.981

IN THIS POSITION NOW

06:40.233 --> 06:42.068
THAT I CAN'T STAND
BEING AROUND YOU.

RYAN ETERNAL REPRESENTS

06:43.444 --> 06:44.987
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE TATTOO
INDUSTRY THAT I HATE.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.198
CAME UP GETTING FAMOUS ON SOCIAL
MEDIA AS A TATTOO MODEL?

06:47.281 --> 06:49.450
THAT'S NOT PAYING YOUR DUES.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.119
{\an8}- MARK THINKS HE TAUGHT ME
ALL THESE TRICKS,

06:51.202 --> 06:52.870
{\an8}HE GAVE ME ALL THE INSIDE SCOOP.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.163
{\an8}THAT IS NOT TRUE.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.498
{\an8}MY STYLE'S NEW SCHOOL,

06:55.581 --> 06:56.499
{\an8}BRIGHT, BOLD COLOR,
MAKE YOU WANT TO SLAP YOUR MOM

06:56.582 --> 06:59.252
{\an8}RIGHT ACROSS THE FACE KIND
OF CARTOONS.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.212
- I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
OVERRUN THE FIRST TATTOO

07:01.295 --> 07:02.964
WE DO HERE AND MAKE IT LOOK BAD.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.298
RYAN'S JUST A COPYCAT.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.800
HE TATTOOS WHAT'S TRENDY,
WHAT'S HOT.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.552
{\an8}I TATTOO THE THINGS I'M
PASSIONATE ABOUT FROM MY HEART.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.429
{\an8}I'M KNOWN FOR A STYLE
CALLED TROPI STYLE.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.014
{\an8}IT'S A STYLE
THAT I'VE COME UP WITH

07:12.098 --> 07:14.433
{\an8}WHERE I INFUSE JAPANESE
AND TROPICAL DESIGNS.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.810
- WE NEED TO GET
PAST THIS [bleep] ROUND.

07:15.893 --> 07:16.686
THAT'S ALL I GIVE
A [bleep] ABOUT.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.188
AFTER THAT, IT'S OPEN SEASON.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.523
[buzz]
- PERFECT.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.817
MAKE SURE
ALL MY BABIES STILL WORK.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.402
[buzz]
PERFECT.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.320
I'M KNOWN
FOR MY NEW SCHOOL TATTOOING,

07:26.404 --> 07:27.738
BUT I'LL KNOCK ANYTHING
OUT OF THE PARK.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.032
PORTRAITS, BLACK AND GRAY,
I'LL DO IT ALL.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.161
{\an8}TIM HAS A GRUDGE AGAINST ME.
HE USED TO WORK AT MY SHOP.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.372
{\an8}TERRIBLE WITH CLIENTS,
AND I JUST HAD TO FIRE HIM.

07:36.455 --> 07:37.748
DUDE, THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO,
AND THAT WAS--

07:37.832 --> 07:40.042
- YES, IT WAS, BUT MY ISSUE
WITH YOU OVER THAT WHOLE THING,

07:40.126 --> 07:41.377
HONESTLY,
WAS NOT TAKING ME ASIDE

07:41.460 --> 07:43.671
AND HAVING A CONVERSATION
WITH ME, LIKE, A STRAIGHT UP MAN

07:43.754 --> 07:45.047
INSTEAD OF PUTTING ME ON BLAST.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.550
I WANTED TO SOCK YOU
IN THE [bleep] JAW THAT DAY.

07:47.633 --> 07:48.718
- GOD.

07:48.801 --> 07:49.802
- I HELPED HIM BUILD HIS SHOP
IN VEGAS,

07:49.886 --> 07:50.970
AND THEN HE TRIED TO BASICALLY

07:51.053 --> 07:51.929
PUNK ME IN FRONT
OF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.890
NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO PAY HIM BACK.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.224
{\an8}IT WILL BE A BLOODBATH,

07:55.308 --> 07:56.893
{\an8}AND I'M GONNA END UP MOPPING
THE FLOOR WITH HIS ASS.

07:56.976 --> 08:01.189
{\an8}I SPECIALIZE IN SURREALISM
TATTOOS MIXED WITH FULL REALISM

08:01.272 --> 08:02.982
{\an8}AND PORTRAIT STYLE DETAILS.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.151
{\an8}IT'S ABOUT TO BE
ON LIKE DONKEY KONG, MAN.

08:14.493 --> 08:15.995
- YOU ARE OUR CANVAS?
- YES.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.246
- OH, AWESOME.
- OKAY, COOL.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.748
{\an8}- EMILY, REALLY NICE
TO MEET YOU.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.042
{\an8}- I'VE REALLY LIKED
THIS SAMURAI THEME.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.752
{\an8}I THINK
IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.670
{\an8}- IT WOULD BE,
HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING

08:24.754 --> 08:26.255
{\an8}ELSE ORIENTAL THOUGH.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.090
{\an8}- CAROLINE AND I HAVE WORKED
AT THE SAME SHOP

08:28.174 --> 08:30.218
{\an8}FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.302
{\an8}SHE LIKES TO TALK A LOT OF
[bleep]

08:31.385 --> 08:33.638
{\an8}AND THEN ACT NICE TO MY FACE

08:33.721 --> 08:35.264
{\an8}WHEN REALLY SHE'S JUST JEALOUS

08:35.347 --> 08:36.265
{\an8}THAT I DO BETTER TATTOOS
THAN HER.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.934
- BLACK AND GRAY WOULD BE GOOD

08:39.018 --> 08:41.520
TO GO ALONG WITH THE REST
OF HIS BLACK AND GRAY.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.438
- I'M NOT LOVING IT.

08:43.522 --> 08:45.441
I'M NOT GOING TO TATTOO
HER [bleep] IDEA.

08:45.524 --> 08:47.443
I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
FOR FIVE YEARS,

08:47.526 --> 08:49.654
AND I'M KNOWN
FOR REALISM AND COLOR.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.155
IF WE DID JAPANESE,

08:51.239 --> 08:54.367
I THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER TO
BLEND OUR STYLES TOGETHER.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.576
{\an8}- JULIA'S FAKE.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.787
{\an8}EVEN THAT VOICE
THAT SHE USES, THAT'S FAKE.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.289
{\an8}SHE SHOULD RESPECT ME
BECAUSE I HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE

09:00.373 --> 09:01.999
{\an8}IN THIS INDUSTRY THAN SHE DOES.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.334
{\an8}MY SPECIALTIES ARE FINE LINE,

09:03.417 --> 09:06.629
{\an8}REALISM, COVER UP,
AND CELTIC WORK.

09:06.712 --> 09:12.093
{\an8}- JUST REMEMBER
WE GOT TO DO IT IN SIX HOURS.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.010
{\an8}- OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
IS YOU,

09:13.094 --> 09:14.679
{\an8}SO YOU KNOW--
- APPRECIATE THAT.

09:14.762 --> 09:16.222
{\an8}- WE TYPICALLY KIND OF HATE
EACH OTHER.

09:16.305 --> 09:17.431
{\an8}- WAY TO MAKE ME FEEL GREAT.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.809
{\an8}- I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU
A COMPLIMENT, [bleep]HOLE.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.227
{\an8}CALM THE [bleep] DOWN.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.520
{\an8}- MY BROTHER AND I ARE RIVALS
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T THINK

09:22.603 --> 09:24.647
{\an8}I TAKE TATTOOING
SERIOUSLY ENOUGH.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.816
{\an8}- I'M DEFINITELY
THE BETTER TATTOOER.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.442
{\an8}I'VE GOT 18 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.

09:28.526 --> 09:29.652
{\an8}I LOVE THIS [bleep].

09:29.735 --> 09:31.445
{\an8}I WILL KILL FOR THIS [bleep].

09:31.529 --> 09:34.573
{\an8}HE JUST DOES IT BECAUSE
IT'S COOL AND GETS HIM [bleep].

09:34.657 --> 09:36.325
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT
OURSELVES IN THE FOOT

09:36.409 --> 09:37.785
BECAUSE I'M FASTER
AND YOU'RE SLOWER.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.996
- DUDE, THAT'S WHY WE'RE GONNA
DO IT A GOOD SIZE.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.330
- WELL, I'M TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT THE SIZE--

09:41.414 --> 09:43.249
- WHERE IT'S NOT TOO BIG.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.835
- ME AND JAYVO USED TO WORK
TOGETHER AT THE FAMILY STUDIO.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.670
AFTER ABOUT 15 YEARS
OF BEING THERE,

09:47.753 --> 09:48.838
I WANTED TO EXPAND,

09:48.921 --> 09:50.840
AND MY FAMILY
TRIED TO HOLD ME BACK.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.800
{\an8}- ROBBIE JUST THINKS HE'S
TOO GOOD FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.802
{\an8}HE PUTS HIMSELF
ABOVE ALL THE REST OF US.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.679
{\an8}I'VE BEEN
TATTOOING FOR 13 YEARS.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.431
{\an8}I'M TIRED OF LIVING
IN MY BROTHER'S SHADOW.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.766
{\an8}I JUST WANT HIM TO SHOW ME
THE RESPECT I DESERVE.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.143
NOT TO SCARE YOU OR ANYTHING,

10:02.226 --> 10:03.769
BUT DO WE NEED TO COME UP
WITH A BACKUP PLAN?

10:03.853 --> 10:06.814
- AH, DUDE, SET A GOAL,
MAKE A PLAN, STICK TO IT.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.900
{\an8}[instrument buzzing]

10:09.984 --> 10:10.901
{\an8}- YOUR HEAD BETTER BE
IN THE GAME.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.904
{\an8}- MINE?
- I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE

10:13.988 --> 10:15.239
{\an8}CARRYING US OVER.
- LIKEWISE.

10:15.323 --> 10:19.285
{\an8}MY RIVALRY WITH LT STARTED WHEN
HE BEAT ME IN A COMPETITION.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.245
{\an8}HE DID NOT DESERVE TO WIN.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.331
{\an8}I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE THE NEXT INK MASTER

10:23.414 --> 10:25.374
{\an8}BECAUSE ANY STYLE
YOU COULD THROW AT ME,

10:25.458 --> 10:26.542
{\an8}I CAN DO A KICK-ASS JOB.

10:26.625 --> 10:27.793
{\an8}- I'M NOT LEAVING
THIS COMPETITION.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.713
{\an8}- I GOT IT.
- EVER SINCE I BEAT TY'ESHA,

10:30.796 --> 10:32.631
{\an8}SHE'S BEEN RUNNING HER MOUTH
TALKING [bleep],

10:32.715 --> 10:33.716
{\an8}SAYING THAT MY ARTWORK'S
NOT UP TO PAR,

10:33.799 --> 10:35.885
{\an8}SO I'M HERE TO SHUT HER UP
FOR GOOD.

10:35.968 --> 10:36.886
{\an8}I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
FOR 2 1/2 YEARS,

10:36.969 --> 10:39.555
{\an8}SO I'M OBVIOUSLY CONSIDERED
ROOKIE,

10:39.639 --> 10:42.224
{\an8}BUT I'M COMING GUNS BLAZING.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.017
- SO YOU'RE GOING BLACK
AND GRAY.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.727
- YEAH. GOT TO STAND OUT.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.520
- THE GIRL'S HEAD
LOOKS [bleep] UP.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.022
- BUT IT'S NOT GONNA
LOOK [bleep] UP.

10:48.105 --> 10:51.108
- OKAY, THAT'S WRONG, AND THEN
THAT SKULL'S [bleep] UP.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.234
- YOUR OPINION DOESN'T MATTER.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.903
- DON'T [bleep] UP.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.238
- HEH.
YOU DON'T [bleep] UP.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.573
EVERYBODY'S DOWNSIZING US.

10:57.656 --> 10:59.784
- YEAH,
TILL WE PUT THAT PIECE OUT,

10:59.867 --> 11:00.910
THEN THEY'RE GONNA FEEL STUPID.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.703
- I'M STARTING TO GET PISSED.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.705
JUST KIND OF GETTING
ON MY NERVES NOW.

11:07.833 --> 11:11.587
- ARTISTS, YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TAG TEAM WITH YOUR RIVAL,

11:11.670 --> 11:14.256
AND REMEMBER,
YOU WILL BE JUDGED AS A TEAM,

11:14.340 --> 11:17.093
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.303
- LET'S DO THIS.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.389
- THIS WAY A LITTLE BIT.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.432
- RIGHT THERE?
PERFECT.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.725
{\an8}- FOR THE TAG TEAM CHALLENGE,

11:24.809 --> 11:26.352
{\an8}IF YOU AND YOUR RIVAL
CAN'T GET ALONG,

11:26.435 --> 11:28.020
{\an8}YOU'RE DEFINITELY GONNA MAKE
THIS CHALLENGE MORE DIFFICULT.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.648
{\an8}THE PEOPLE THAT BUTT HEADS,
THEY'RE GONNA BE SCREWED.

11:30.731 --> 11:31.607
{\an8}I'M LOOKING
FOR STRONG FUNDAMENTALS

11:31.690 --> 11:34.860
{\an8}SO I CAN KNOW
WHO DESERVES TO BE HERE

11:34.944 --> 11:35.903
{\an8}AND WHO NEEDS TO GO HOME.

11:35.986 --> 11:36.445
- GOOD?
- GOOD, MAN.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.072
LET'S GO.

11:45.204 --> 11:49.083
{\an8}- WHAT I WAS THINKING, BLACK
DOWN, AND LEAVE THAT WHOLE.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.502
{\an8}- DON'T STAND OVER ME.
- I'M JUST WATCHING.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.712
{\an8}- I WANT YOU TO STAND
THE [bleep] AWAY FROM ME.

11:53.796 --> 11:54.713
{\an8}AARON'S ON MY SHOULDER
LIKE A HAWK.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.883
{\an8}BIRD, BE GONE.
I DON'T NEED YOU.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.053
{\an8}I'M KNOWN FOR BEING ABLE
TO DO ANY KIND OF TATTOO.

12:01.137 --> 12:04.932
{\an8}IT IS MY GOAL TO BE THE FIRST
FEMALE WINNER OF <i> INK MASTER.</i>

12:05.015 --> 12:06.308
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO CRAZY
WITH THE BLACK EITHER.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.435
{\an8}- YOU'RE STRESSING ME
OUT THOUGH.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.728
{\an8}- EMILY IS A BITCH.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.273
{\an8}SHE USES HER BREASTS,
SHE USES HER LOOKS TO GET AHEAD,

12:12.356 --> 12:14.066
{\an8}AND IT'S RIDICULOUS.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.027
- I'M GONNA STUFF MY TITS
BACK IN MY SHIRT.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.487
- I SPENT 16 YEARS

12:18.571 --> 12:20.322
BUSTING MY ASS TO GET
WHERE I'M AT AS A TATTOOER,

12:20.406 --> 12:21.657
AND SHE'S WORKING
THE SAME CONVENTIONS I AM

12:21.740 --> 12:23.325
WITH A CORSET ON,

12:23.409 --> 12:26.328
WITH A PORTFOLIO THAT'S LACKING
BECAUSE HER SKILL SET SUCKS.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.913
I'M KNOWN FOR MY REALISM,

12:27.997 --> 12:30.833
BUT LATELY I'VE BEEN EXPANDING
INTO SACRED GEOMETRY

12:30.916 --> 12:32.293
AND DOT WORK.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.545
ARE YOU GONNA DO ANY OF THAT
LIGHTER BIT ON THE EYEBROWS?

12:34.628 --> 12:35.629
- YEAH.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.593
{\an8}- FIVE HOURS REMAINING,
SWITCH ARTISTS.

12:40.676 --> 12:41.719
{\an8}- YOU WEREN'T PLANNING
TO HIGHLIGHT THAT SPOT, DUDE?

12:41.802 --> 12:43.762
{\an8}- NAH,
WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN [bleep].

12:43.846 --> 12:45.347
{\an8}- DON'T GET MAD
IF I ACTUALLY GET IN THERE

12:45.431 --> 12:47.391
{\an8}AND JUST LIGHTEN IT UP FOR YOU.
- DUDE, DON'T TOUCH MY SIDE.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.476
{\an8}THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE CHALLENGE.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.519
{\an8}YOU DO YOUR OWN [bleep],
AND I DO MY OWN [bleep].

12:50.603 --> 12:52.021
{\an8}- BRO,
WE'RE IN IT TOGETHER, MAN.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.022
{\an8}YOU CAN TAKE THE SUGGESTION.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.148
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.357
{\an8}WHEN I'M IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT,

12:55.441 --> 12:56.692
{\an8}I'LL LISTEN TO YOUR IDEAS,

12:56.775 --> 12:59.320
{\an8}BUT AT THE END,
IT'LL BE MY WAY.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.988
I SPECIALIZE IN BLACK AND GRAY.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.282
CRIS ELEMENT WAS A LITTLE
BACKSTABBING,

13:03.365 --> 13:04.283
STAIR CLIMBING WEASEL.

13:04.366 --> 13:05.367
HE USED TO WORK FOR ME,

13:05.451 --> 13:07.036
AND ONE DAY HE JUST QUIT.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.662
CRIS HAS NO LOYALTY,

13:08.746 --> 13:10.080
AND I'M HERE TO SEEK REVENGE.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.374
- I'LL FIX UP EVERYTHING
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.210
IT'S ALL RIGHT. DON'T WORRY.
- YEAH, OKAY.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.794
{\an8}- I JUST UP
AND LEFT ANGEL'S SHOP

13:15.878 --> 13:17.463
{\an8}JUST BECAUSE I
COULDN'T TAKE HIS ATTITUDE.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.465
{\an8}I'M COMPLETELY SELF TAUGHT.

13:19.548 --> 13:20.633
{\an8}I PRACTICE ON MY WIFE.

13:20.716 --> 13:21.842
{\an8}I PRACTICE ON MYSELF.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.010
{\an8}I PRACTICE ON MY FRIENDS.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.428
{\an8}I'M BETTER THAN ANGEL.
I'M BETTER

13:24.512 --> 13:27.348
{\an8}THAN EVERYTHING HE DOES
AND EVERYTHING THAT HE CAN DO.

13:29.808 --> 13:34.396
- OH, I'M DOING GREAT,
BUT I DO FEEL LIKE [bleep].

13:34.480 --> 13:37.566
- TWO HOURS LEFT,
SWITCH ARTISTS.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.526
- I JUST NEED SOME AIR.
REALLY [bleep].

13:38.609 --> 13:40.778
I'M STRESSED, AND I'M PISSED.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.154
{\an8}IT'S THROWING ME OFF MY GAME.

13:42.238 --> 13:42.821
{\an8}I'M NOT FEELING GOOD.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.823
{\an8}I'M FREAKING OUT.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.700
UGH.
[bleep].

13:49.787 --> 13:51.664
[vomits]

13:52.623 --> 13:53.874
{\an8}- YOU KEEP GOING ROGUE.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.584
{\an8}- WHAT DO I NEED TO FOLLOW YOU
FOR? I DO MY OWN [bleep].

13:55.668 --> 13:57.127
{\an8}- I KNOW
I COULD HAVE HANDLED IT.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.337
{\an8}- COME OUT OF YOUR WET DREAM.
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE BACK.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.180
{\an8}- UGH.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.098
{\an8}- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:10.516 --> 14:12.351
- YOU?
- YEAH.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.812
- YOU ALREADY SUCK,
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE SICK?

14:14.895 --> 14:16.939
THIS TATTOO'S GOING FROM BAD
TO WORSE FAST.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.234
{\an8}- IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT SIDE,
LEAVE THIS SIDE,

14:20.317 --> 14:21.902
{\an8}AND THEN MAYBE START
ON THE BOTTOM JAW.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.571
{\an8}MY RIVAL'S NAME IS ERIK SIUDA.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.072
{\an8}I'VE ONLY MET HIM A FEW TIMES
IN PERSON.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.907
{\an8}ONE DAY HE PUT HIS [bleep]
COMMENT ON MY INSTAGRAM.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.285
{\an8}I'M LIKE,
"WHO THE [bleep] IS THIS GUY?"

14:29.368 --> 14:30.869
{\an8}AND WE'VE BEEN
BACK AND FORTH EVER SINCE.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.415
YOU'LL NEVER MEET A MORE
TECHNICAL TATTOOER THAN ME.

14:34.498 --> 14:38.252
CLEAN LINE WORK, SOLID COLOR,
MY ARTWORK IS MIND-BLOWING.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.628
- IS THIS JAPANESE INSPIRED?

14:39.712 --> 14:40.963
- YES.
- THAT'S YOUR THING?

14:41.046 --> 14:42.798
- I STARTED OUT DOING A LOT
OF JAPANESE.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.091
- OKAY, 'CAUSE YOU KNOW CHRIS--
- HE'S A BIG--

14:44.174 --> 14:46.635
- YEAH, HE'S GONNA
GO OVER THOSE FINGER WAVES

14:46.719 --> 14:47.970
WITH A FINE-TOOTHED COMB.

14:48.053 --> 14:48.971
{\an8}- OH, YEAH. I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
SINCE I'M 15,

14:49.054 --> 14:50.973
{\an8}BEFORE I WAS LEGAL
IN NEW YORK CITY,

14:51.056 --> 14:52.808
{\an8}AND MY STYLE OF TATTOOING
IS THE ERIK SIUDA STYLE,

14:52.891 --> 14:55.811
{\an8}JAPANESE TRADITIONAL
AND REALISM.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.313
I'M DEFINITELY GOING HOME
WITH THE PRIZE.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.148
THERE'S NO HESITATION
OR DOUBT IN MY MIND

14:59.231 --> 15:00.899
THAT I'M GONNA
WIN THIS WHOLE COMPETITION.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.527
- FINAL HOUR, GUYS,
SWITCH ARTISTS.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.865
- NO PRESSURE.

15:07.948 --> 15:08.991
LESS THAN AN HOUR,
DON'T SCREW IT UP.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.160
- IF ANYTHING,
I'M FIXING EVERYTHING.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.454
- IT'S JUST OUR FIRST FRICKING
CHALLENGE.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.747
- DUDE, WE GOT 20 MINUTES.

15:14.830 --> 15:15.914
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME?
- I'LL JUST GO BACK TO--

15:15.998 --> 15:17.374
- I MEAN, I CAN DO SOME WHITE,
BUT I GOT TO DO

15:17.458 --> 15:18.500
THAT PURPLE STILL.
- NO, DO THAT PURPLE FIRST.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.210
{\an8}JOSH AND I ARE ACTUALLY
WORKING TOGETHER HERE.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.546
{\an8}WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TALK [bleep] TO EACH OTHER.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.882
{\an8}OH, I MISSED A SPOT.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.383
{\an8}FILL IN THAT LITTLE SPOT
IN THE MIDDLE.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.635
{\an8}THAT'S THE ONE I MISSED.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.011
THE GAME IS ON NOW,
AND WE NEED TO GET BUSY.

15:33.474 --> 15:39.104
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.523
MACHINES DOWN,
NO MORE TATTOOING.

15:41.607 --> 15:42.858
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:42.941 --> 15:43.484
- OH, MY GOD.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.903
IT LOOKS AMAZING.

15:45.986 --> 15:49.031
- OH, THAT IS COOL.
- THERE YOU GO.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.866
WRAP THIS WOMAN UP.

15:50.949 --> 15:52.201
- I AIN'T WRAPPING [bleep] UP.
YOU WRAP IT UP.

15:52.284 --> 15:52.951
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU READY TO SEE IT?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.287
- OH, THAT'S BADASS.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.538
THAT IS BADASS.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.291
{\an8}- TY'ESHA AND LT'S TATTOO
IS BUSTED.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.585
{\an8}THE CHICK'S FACE
IS LIKE A COMPLETE V.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.836
{\an8}SHE LOOKS LIKE AN ALIEN,

16:02.920 --> 16:05.339
{\an8}AND THE SHADING,
IT'S HAMMERED.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.554
- WELL, WASN'T THAT FUN?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.890
ANYBODY ELSE ENJOY THEMSELVES?

16:14.973 --> 16:17.851
- WHO THINKS THEY MIGHT BE
GOING HOME, RAISE YOUR HAND.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.107
- LT SCREWED THE POOCH
ON THIS ONE.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.234
- I'M DISAPPOINTED, MAN.
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.654
- YOU CAME IN HERE SO CONFIDENT.
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:28.737 --> 16:29.947
- YOU GUYS
TELLING ME THIS AND THAT.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.241
IT'S NOT HELPING ME, ALL RIGHT?
IT'S REALLY NOT.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.701
- YOU BLAMED YOUR POOR ARTWORK

16:33.784 --> 16:35.744
AND YOUR POOR TECHNICAL QUALITY
ON BEING NAUSEOUS.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.414
BITCH, YOU CAN'T TATTOO!

16:38.497 --> 16:39.790
- I CAN [bleep] TATTOO,
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING

16:39.873 --> 16:41.959
[bleep] PROVE TO EVERYBODY.
- THEN YOU PROVE IT, DUMMY!

16:42.042 --> 16:43.711
- THAT'S WHY I'M GETTING
[bleep] PISSED.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.421
- 'CAUSE YOU [bleep] SUCK!
- THAT'S WHY I'M GETTING PISSED

16:45.504 --> 16:46.088
BECAUSE I GOT A LOT
OF [bleep] TO PROVE,

16:46.171 --> 16:48.132
AND THAT'S IT.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.466
- THE GUY THAT WALKS AROUND LIKE
THIS IS GONNA GET PICKED ON.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.343
THE GUY THAT WALKS AROUND PROUD
WITH CONFIDENCE DOESN'T.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.430
- THEY'RE NOT JUDGING IF
YOUR HEAD'S WALKING AROUND LOW.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.889
THAT'S JUST YOU GUYS
TALKING [bleep] TO HIM.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.725
I'M GONNA TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,
IT'S [bleep] TATTOOS

16:57.808 --> 17:00.269
IS WHAT SENDS YOU HOME.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.271
- AND THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.709
- TODAY YOU HAD TO WORK WITH
YOUR RIVAL ON THE SAME TATTOO,

17:23.791 --> 17:26.627
AND REMEMBER,
YOU'RE BEING JUDGED AS A TEAM.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.506
ANGEL AND CRIS,
LET'S START WITH YOU.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.635
SO HOW WAS IT WORKING TOGETHER
AS RIVALS?

17:33.719 --> 17:34.803
- HONESTLY,
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SWALLOW.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.013
CRIS DON'T KNOW HOW TO LISTEN.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.140
I GIVE A LITTLE PIECE
OF ADVICE--

17:38.223 --> 17:39.349
- I KNOW HOW TO LISTEN, MAN.
YOU DON'T--

17:39.433 --> 17:40.559
- WELL, YOU CAN AT LEAST
FOLLOW IT, MAN.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.060
- NO, WHAT DO I NEED TO FOLLOW
YOU FOR?

17:42.144 --> 17:43.645
I'LL DO MY OWN [bleep].
- YOU KEEP GOING ROGUE, MAN.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.355
- ONCE WE DO OUR OWN STUFF, THEN
WE'LL SEE WHO'S THE WEAKER LINK.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.067
- I THINK THERE'S PROBLEMS
THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE TATTOO,

17:48.150 --> 17:50.360
SO I DON'T THINK THE BLAME
IS ON ANY ONE PERSON.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.154
FROM AFAR,
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.698
YOU GET IN HERE AND REALLY
NITPICK THIS TECHNICALLY,

17:54.782 --> 17:56.158
THERE'S SOME BLOWN OUT OUTLINES,

17:56.241 --> 17:57.993
A LOT OF SOFT COLOR
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE SOLID.

17:58.076 --> 17:59.661
TECHNICALLY IT'S A PRETTY WEAK
TATTOO.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.289
- YOU GUYS DIDN'T
COME TOGETHER WELL AS A TEAM,

18:02.372 --> 18:04.208
AND IT REFLECTED IN YOUR TATTOO.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.754
- DON AND ERIK.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.841
- THIS TATTOO SHOWS A LOT
OF PROMISE,

18:12.925 --> 18:13.675
SHOWS A LOT
OF GOOD TECHNICAL PRECISION.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.011
THE OUTLINE'S STRONG.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.387
- OLLIE SAYS
HE LIKES THE OUTLINES ON THIS,

18:17.471 --> 18:18.806
BUT SOME OF THE OUTLINE'S
NOT SO HOT.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.184
THE WHOLE TOP OF THE SKULL'S
HEAD IS JUST A WIGGLY,

18:22.267 --> 18:23.477
NOT-SOLID LINE.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.187
IF IT WASN'T SO BIG,
YOU WOULD HAVE MORE TIME

18:25.270 --> 18:27.356
TO REALLY MAKE
THAT SMOOTH AND SOLID.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.732
- ALL SHE WANTED
WAS A HALF-SLEEVE.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.442
- IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF SERVING THE CLIENT,

18:30.526 --> 18:34.696
MAKE SURE
THAT YOU DON'T HURT YOURSELF.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.824
- JOSH AND JASON.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.954
- THE COLOR SATURATION,
THE OUTLINE,

18:42.037 --> 18:44.748
AND THE WAY YOU MADE THE TATTOO
BREATHABLE, STANDS OUT.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.543
- VERY BEAUTIFULLY DRAWN,
THIS THING IS TECHNICALLY SOUND.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.169
YOU GAVE US SOMETHING
RIGHT OFF THE BAT

18:49.253 --> 18:50.546
THAT'S GONNA SET THE BAR
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. GOOD JOB.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.841
- THANK YOU.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.968
- MARK AND RYAN.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.557
- IF THERE'S ANY ARROGANCE
BETWEEN EITHER ONE OF YOU,

19:01.640 --> 19:03.308
LOOKING AT THAT SCREEN
SHOULD BE VERY HUMBLING.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.894
THERE'S NOT SMOOTH,
SOLID AREAS OF BLACK.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.563
THERE'S NOT SUPER CLEAN
LINE WORK.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.772
- AS FAR AS THE LINE WORK GOES,

19:08.856 --> 19:09.773
HE STARTED OFF LINING,

19:09.857 --> 19:11.483
AND HIS HAND
WAS SHAKING LIKE A LEAF.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.610
I MEAN, IT LOOKED LIKE
A LITTLE WET CHIHUAHUA.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.863
- YOU HAVE SO MUCH GOING ON
IN THE FOREGROUND

19:15.946 --> 19:18.031
WITH ALL THE TEXTURE,
AND THE COLOR, AND THE BLENDING,

19:18.115 --> 19:19.408
THAT IT'S MESSY AND CONFUSING.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.327
- THIS TATTOO IS NOT
BY ANY MEANS IMPRESSIVE.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.998
- CAROLINE AND JULIA.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.041
- THIS TATTOO DOESN'T GIVE
US A LOT TO GO ON.

19:28.125 --> 19:28.876
IT'S A MESSY DESIGN,
AND IT LOOKS LIGHT

19:28.959 --> 19:31.086
AND FEATHERY AND SCRATCHY.

19:31.169 --> 19:32.588
- THIS TATTOO
NEEDED A STRONGER OUTLINE.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.423
THE LITTLE BIT OF OUTLINE
THAT IS THERE IS NOT COMPLETE.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.593
THEY DON'T CONNECT,
AND IT'S PRETTY SHAKY.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.844
THESE SKULLS LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE MADE OUT OF RUBBER.

19:38.927 --> 19:41.471
THEY DON'T LOOK HARD.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.098
THEY DON'T LOOK RIGID,
AND THEY DON'T LOOK REALISTIC.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.225
- IF YOU WANT TO SHOW OFF
AND IMPRESS, THIS ISN'T THE WAY.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.940
- EMILY AND AARON.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.610
- TECHNICALLY IT'S A VERY SOLID
TATTOO, CLEAN OUTLINES,

19:54.693 --> 19:56.153
SOLID BLACK, SMOOTH COLOR.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.946
ARTISTICALLY THE FINGERS

19:58.030 --> 20:01.241
AT THE BOTTOM LOOK
TOTALLY WONKED, BROKEN, WEIRD.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.368
- THE OVERALL COMPOSITION
OF THE DRAWING IS SLOPPY, LOOSE,

20:03.452 --> 20:06.955
AND HAPHAZARD.
DON'T DO HAPHAZARD THINGS.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.917
DO THINGS
THAT ARE GONNA BE SOLID.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.837
- ROBBIE AND JAYVO.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.089
- OVERALL THIS TATTOO,

20:16.173 --> 20:17.174
YOUR OUTLINE

20:17.257 --> 20:19.009
IS DEFINITELY STRONG.
- THANK YOU.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.178
- NOT REALLY CRAZY
ABOUT THE COMPOSITION.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.512
I DON'T REALLY GET THE FEELING

20:22.596 --> 20:23.889
THAT THIS APE
IS SWINGING FROM A TREE.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.849
IT'S JUST STANDING THERE
YANKING HIS CHAIN BASICALLY

20:25.933 --> 20:28.185
IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.353
AS FAR AS THE QUALITY
OF THE TATTOO,

20:29.436 --> 20:31.063
THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOME GOOD LINES IN HERE,

20:31.146 --> 20:32.648
AND BRIGHT, VIBRANT COLOR

20:32.731 --> 20:39.237
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR
THROUGHOUT THIS COMPETITION.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.199
- LT AND TY'ESHA.

20:42.282 --> 20:44.826
- BEST OF LUCK.

20:46.119 --> 20:48.497
- THE IMPERFECTIONS
STAND OUT PRETTY STRONG.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.165
THOSE OUTLINES AROUND THE EYES,

20:50.249 --> 20:52.376
THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM
TO BE SHAPED THE SAME.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.835
YOU WOULD HAVE
BEEN WAY BETTER OFF

20:53.919 --> 20:55.921
WITHOUT THOSE SKETCHY LINES
ON THERE AT ALL.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.214
- IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS STUFF,

20:57.297 --> 20:58.882
MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S YOUR STRONG SUIT.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.343
- HE TOLD ME
THAT THIS WAS HIS SPECIALTY.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.344
- A FACE?
- HE DOES FACES,

21:02.427 --> 21:04.680
SO I LET HIM TAKE THE REINS
ON THAT.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.348
- THE EYES ARE SO FAR APART,

21:06.431 --> 21:09.017
THEY'RE MORE ON HER TEMPLES
THAN ON THE FRONT OF HER FACE.

21:09.101 --> 21:09.851
- EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE
BEEN READY

21:09.935 --> 21:11.019
TO DO WHAT THEY'RE GOOD AT.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.272
THIS IS A ROUGH TATTOO.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.692
- WHAT A JOKE.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.819
- TIM AND CLEEN.

21:22.406 --> 21:26.034
- FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE [bleep]
YOURSELF GOING THIS BIG.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.953
TO DO THIS BIG A TATTOO
IS STUPID.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.163
- WELL, I KNOW I COULD HAVE
HANDLED IT. I DREW IT. I--

21:30.247 --> 21:31.873
- WE BOTH DID A COUPLE
OF DESIGNS, BUT I DIDN'T--

21:31.957 --> 21:33.875
- BUT YOURS WAS TERRIBLE.
- IT WASN'T TERRIBLE.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.335
COME OUT OF YOUR WET DREAM.
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE BACK.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.879
- I PROBABLY COULD HAVE DONE THE
WHOLE TATTOO IN HALF THE TIME

21:37.963 --> 21:39.881
THAT BOTH OF US DID THE TATTOO,
BUT HE WAS COCKY AND SAID,

21:39.965 --> 21:40.966
"OH, I CAN DO THIS."
- BUT IT WASN'T

21:41.049 --> 21:42.092
A DO-IT-BY-YOURSELF CHALLENGE.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.844
- YEAH, BUT IF YOU HAVE A GUY
THAT'S--

21:43.927 --> 21:45.470
- IT WAS A DO IT WITH YOUR TEAM.
IT WAS MAKE SMART DECISIONS

21:45.554 --> 21:47.848
FROM THE START,
WHICH NEITHER OF YOU DID,

21:47.931 --> 21:50.517
AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THIS
HUGE TATTOO THAT'S MEDIOCRE.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.354
SECOND OF ALL, THE BACKGROUND,
WHAT THE [bleep]?

21:54.438 --> 21:55.564
IT'S HUGE,

21:55.647 --> 21:57.607
AND IT'S JUST SENSELESS,
GRAY SCRIBBLE

21:57.691 --> 21:58.942
ALL OVER THIS GUY'S BACK.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.236
- TIE THE BACKGROUND
INTO THE FOREGROUND

22:01.319 --> 22:02.863
IF YOU'RE GONNA
DO THIS MUCH BACKGROUND

22:02.946 --> 22:04.322
SO IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE AN AFTERTHOUGHT.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.324
RIGHT NOW,
YOU HAVE A BIG AFTERTHOUGHT.

22:08.618 --> 22:11.246
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

22:11.329 --> 22:12.414
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.839
{\an8}- THERE IS A CATCH.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.549
{\an8}- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
HOW LOUD YOU GET!

22:22.632 --> 22:23.967
{\an8}YOU WANT TO [bleep]
TALK TO ME LIKE THAT?

22:24.051 --> 22:25.886
{\an8}- I'M TALKING TO YOU.
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.686
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
TAG TEAM TATTOOING HERE,

22:34.770 --> 22:39.107
RIVALS TATTOOING WITH EACH OTHER
ON THE SAME CANVAS.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.358
- WE SAW SOME SERIOUS BATTLES

22:40.442 --> 22:42.861
BETWEEN THE TWO RIVALS
TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER,

22:42.944 --> 22:45.405
AND THEN WE SAW OTHER RIVALS
WORK TOGETHER REALLY WELL.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.616
- IT DID SEEM THAT WAY,
BUT THERE WERE ALSO SOME TATTOOS

22:47.699 --> 22:48.867
THAT REALLY SEEMED TO SUFFER

22:48.950 --> 22:51.495
FROM THE FACT
THAT THESE ARTISTS COULDN'T GET

22:51.578 --> 22:53.705
PAST THEIR PERSONAL ISSUES.
- RIGHT.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.874
- WELL, LET'S START OFF
WITH MARK AND RYAN.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.417
- THE TIKI LOOKS BEAT.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.752
IT LOOKS ROUGH.

22:58.835 --> 23:00.712
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY
WERE FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER

23:00.796 --> 23:02.964
ON THIS PERSON'S SKIN.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.634
- CLEEN AND TIM,
WHO DID THIS OWL BACK PIECE.

23:05.717 --> 23:08.929
- THE BACKGROUND
MAKES THIS TATTOO IMPASSABLE.

23:09.012 --> 23:11.139
- CAROLINE AND JULIA.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.682
- THE LEAVES LOOK WEAK.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.017
THE OUTLINE'S NOT GOOD,

23:14.101 --> 23:17.145
AND OVERALL
THIS IS AN UNAPPEALING TATTOO.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.148
- TY'ESHA AND LT.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.984
JUST LOOKS UNFINISHED, TOO DARK.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.653
- THERE'S NO EXCUSE
FOR THE OUTLINES.

23:24.736 --> 23:27.155
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SPLIT UP THESE ARTISTS,

23:27.239 --> 23:30.033
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEE WHO
IS PUTTING OUT THE STRONG WORK,

23:30.117 --> 23:31.409
AND WHO IS PUTTING OUT
THE WEAK WORK.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.495
WE'LL KNOW WHO STAYS, WHO GOES.
- ALL RIGHT.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.996
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A DECISION.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.164
WANT TO GO GET THEM?

23:38.291 --> 23:40.252
- DUDE, YOU LOOK SICK
LIKE YOU'RE GONNA VOMIT

23:40.335 --> 23:41.878
OR SOMETHING FOR A DIFFERENT
REASON THIS TIME.

23:44.172 --> 23:46.091
- UH-OH.
- OH, MAN.

23:46.174 --> 23:47.551
- OH, DAMN.

23:51.054 --> 23:54.850
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THE JUDGES
WANT TO SEE EVERYBODY.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.768
SEE YOU ALL DOWNSTAIRS.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.355
- WELL, LET'S NOT WASTE
THE MAN'S TIME.

24:00.438 --> 24:02.190
SHALL WE?

24:08.697 --> 24:13.201
- TODAY YOU HAD
TO FACE A MAJOR OBSTACLE,

24:13.285 --> 24:16.538
TAG TEAM TATTOOING
WITH YOUR RIVAL.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.832
SOME OF YOU PROVED
YOU HAVE THE ESSENTIAL SKILLS

24:18.915 --> 24:20.917
TO CREATE A GREAT TATTOO,

24:21.001 --> 24:22.669
BUT SOME OF YOU CLASHED,

24:22.752 --> 24:25.213
AND IT SHOWS IN YOUR WORK.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.757
JULIA, CAROLINE,

24:27.841 --> 24:30.468
TY'ESHA, LT,

24:30.552 --> 24:33.221
MARK, AND RYAN,

24:33.305 --> 24:34.639
PLEASE STEP FORWARD.

24:41.980 --> 24:47.569
ALL OF YOU HAD THE WORST TATTOOS
OF THE DAY.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.446
IF I DIDN'T CALL YOUR NAME,

24:49.529 --> 24:54.409
YOU'RE SAFE FROM ELIMINATION
FOR NOW.

24:54.492 --> 24:56.745
THE SIX OF YOU ARE GOING
TO HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE TO PROVE

24:56.828 --> 25:01.249
YOU HAVE THE ESSENTIAL SKILLS
TO CONTINUE IN THIS COMPETITION.

25:01.333 --> 25:06.922
YOU MUST NOW FACE OFF
AGAINST YOUR RIVAL.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.174
YOU AND YOUR RIVAL
MUST TATTOO HEAD-TO-HEAD.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.593
ONE RIVAL WILL WIN,

25:11.676 --> 25:13.929
AND ONE RIVAL WILL LOSE.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.513
LOSE AND YOU COULD END UP
BEING THE FIRST ARTIST

25:15.597 --> 25:18.725
TO PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.102
YOU'VE BEEN RANDOMLY ASSIGNED
AN OPEN CANVAS,

25:21.186 --> 25:23.730
AND YOU WILL HAVE FOUR HOURS
TO TATTOO,

25:23.813 --> 25:26.942
BUT THERE IS A CATCH.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.860
YOUR RIVAL WILL IMPACT YOUR FATE

25:28.944 --> 25:34.616
BECAUSE YOUR RIVAL WILL PICK
THE STYLE YOU MUST TATTOO.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.915
- THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

25:41.998 --> 25:45.126
- THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO EXPOSE YOUR RIVAL'S WEAKNESS,

25:45.210 --> 25:48.296
SO CHOOSE WISELY.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.842
JULIA, WHAT STYLE DO
YOU PICK FOR CAROLINE?

25:52.926 --> 25:54.719
- NEOTRADITIONAL.

25:56.096 --> 25:59.683
- CAROLINE, WHAT STYLE
DO YOU PICK FOR JULIA?

25:59.766 --> 26:01.559
- BIOMECHANICAL.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.232
- TY'ESHA,
WHAT STYLE DO YOU PICK FOR LT?

26:07.315 --> 26:09.359
- COLOR REALISM.

26:10.735 --> 26:14.781
- LT, WHAT STYLE
DO YOU PICK FOR TY'ESHA?

26:18.576 --> 26:19.619
- CURSIVE LETTERING.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.208
- MARK,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA GIVE RYAN?

26:25.292 --> 26:29.296
- I PICK JAPANESE.

26:29.379 --> 26:33.341
- AND FINALLY, RYAN,
WHAT STYLE DO YOU PICK FOR MARK?

26:33.425 --> 26:37.095
- I PICK COLOR REALISM.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.389
- YOU CAME HERE TO PROVE

26:39.472 --> 26:41.182
THAT YOU'RE A BETTER ARTIST
THAN YOUR RIVAL.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.978
IF YOU BLOW THIS, YOU
COULD BE PACKING YOUR MACHINES.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.104
LET'S HEAD TO THE SHOP
AND MEET YOUR CANVASES,

26:46.187 --> 26:49.566
AND GOOD LUCK.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.613
- I'M JULIA.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

26:55.697 --> 26:56.698
- HOW ARE YOU?

26:56.781 --> 26:59.868
- I WAS ASSIGNED
TO DO CURSIVE LETTERING.

26:59.951 --> 27:03.371
- DO YOU HAVE
ANY PARTICULAR TYPE OF IMAGERY

27:03.455 --> 27:05.123
THAT YOU'RE INTO
AS OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER?

27:05.206 --> 27:07.834
- I LIKE SKULLS.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.044
SKULLS, ROSES.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.379
- ANY OTHER IMAGERY
BESIDES SKULLS AND ROSES,

27:11.463 --> 27:12.756
OR THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE--
- NAH.

27:12.839 --> 27:16.384
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
AGAIN I'M DOING SKULL AND ROSES

27:16.468 --> 27:18.887
{\an8}WHICH I GOT YELLED AT
FOR BEFORE, AND I'M DOING IT

27:18.970 --> 27:22.057
{\an8}IN NEOTRADITIONAL, WHICH I'VE
NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.309
{\an8}BUT I DID GIVE JULIA
BIOMECHANICAL,

27:24.392 --> 27:26.353
{\an8}AND I KNOW SHE SUCKS AT IT.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.062
- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TATTOOED
BY A LADY BEFORE?

27:27.145 --> 27:29.314
- UH, NO.

27:29.397 --> 27:32.067
- IT'LL BE LIKE GETTING TATTOOED
BY AN ANGEL.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.693
- I AM GONNA BEAT JULIA.

27:33.777 --> 27:37.864
EXPERIENCE
ALWAYS TRUMPS INEXPERIENCE.

27:37.947 --> 27:38.782
- SO, ALREADY KNOW

27:38.865 --> 27:40.909
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
- OKAY.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.452
- HE THINKS
I CAN'T DO COLOR REALISM.

27:42.535 --> 27:43.578
I DO A LOT OF OCEAN THEME STUFF,

27:43.661 --> 27:46.623
SO I'M GONNA DO
A SEA TURTLE ON YOU.

27:46.706 --> 27:47.749
- OKAY.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.334
- WHAT YOU GOT GOING ON
OVER THERE?

27:49.417 --> 27:51.586
- UM, I'M THINKING WE'RE
GONNA GO WITH A HANNYA MASK.

27:51.669 --> 27:52.921
- ARE YOU GONNA
ACTUALLY DRAW IT?

27:53.004 --> 27:55.924
- YOU KNOW I CAN DRAW.

27:56.007 --> 27:56.966
- ANY SPECIFIC ANIMALS YOU LIKE?

27:57.050 --> 27:58.468
- MAYBE LIKE
PEACOCK OR SOMETHING?

27:58.551 --> 28:00.804
- YEAH, THAT'S A LOT OF WORK...

28:00.887 --> 28:01.805
{\an8}I'M STRESSING THE [bleep] OUT.

28:01.888 --> 28:04.432
{\an8}CAUSE I HAVE TO GO
FULL COLOR ON IT.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.850
{\an8}- LT, HE DOESN'T REALLY LOOK
LIKE HE HAS IT.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.728
{\an8}I LOVE WATCHING HIM SHAKE
AND GET ALL NERVOUS.

28:08.812 --> 28:11.231
- I'M THINKING
ABOUT DOING A HUMMINGBIRD.

28:11.314 --> 28:13.233
- I'M NOT LOVING THAT.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.318
- TY'ESHA'S ASSIGNED
ME COLOR REALISM,

28:15.402 --> 28:16.361
AND I'M A BLACK AND GRAY ARTIST.

28:16.444 --> 28:19.239
I'M SCREWED.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.289
- I HOPE IT'S A DOUBLE
ELIMINATION, BECAUSE THEN

28:28.373 --> 28:31.793
IT'S TWO LESS PEOPLE THAT I
HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY DAY.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.670
- EMILY IS SUCH A BITCH.

28:33.753 --> 28:34.796
- I KNOW I'M NOT GOING HOME.

28:34.879 --> 28:38.925
Y'ALL ON THE OTHER HAND,
BEST OF LUCK.

28:39.008 --> 28:41.010
- I DOUBT I'M GOING HOME TODAY.

28:41.094 --> 28:43.471
- I REALLY WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.098
- WHATEVER, BITCH.
- GO HOME.

28:45.181 --> 28:47.392
I'LL MAKE SURE TO PACK
YOUR BAGS FOR YOU EVEN.

28:47.475 --> 28:49.352
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT YOU CAN DO BY YOURSELF.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.813
- GIRL, I WILL TATTOO CIRCLES
AROUND YOU,

28:51.896 --> 28:52.981
BUT I WON'T HAVE TO
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE GONE BY THEN,

28:53.064 --> 28:55.650
SO IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.
- [bleep] TWIT.

28:55.733 --> 28:58.027
- YOU ARE GOING HOME.
PACK YOUR BAGS.

28:58.111 --> 29:00.780
I MEAN, YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO
DO IT NOW, I'M JUST SAYING.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.365
- I'M DONE
WITH THIS CONVERSATION.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.033
- GOOD-BYE.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.326
ARE YOU GONNA GO CRY?

29:06.578 --> 29:09.664
- [chuckles]
BARBIE? PLEASE.

29:09.747 --> 29:10.832
BARBIE WISHED SHE HAD THESE.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.137
- ARTISTS, YOUR RIVALS
HAVE CHALLENGED YOU WITH A STYLE

29:24.220 --> 29:27.474
THAT THEY THINK WILL TAKE YOU
OUT OF THE COMPETITION.

29:27.557 --> 29:30.852
YOU HAVE FOUR HOURS TO TATTOO,

29:30.935 --> 29:34.355
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.316
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.
- LET'S GET IT POPPING.

29:36.399 --> 29:37.901
{\an8}- GOING INTO THESE
HEAD-TO-HEAD TATTOOS,

29:37.984 --> 29:40.028
{\an8}IT'S GONNA BE GOOD FOR US
TO REALLY SEE THESE PEOPLE

29:40.111 --> 29:41.488
{\an8}WORK BY THEMSELF.

29:41.571 --> 29:43.990
WE'LL BE ABLE TO PICK OUT
WHO WAS THE WEAK PARTNER.

29:44.073 --> 29:45.867
THIS IS THE TATTOO
THAT YOU GOT NO EXCUSES.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.911
- ALL RIGHT, MAN,
LET'S GET ABOUT IT.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.458
- OH, GREAT.
- BIOMECHANICAL.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.543
HAVE YOU EVER
DONE ONE BEFORE THIS?

29:55.627 --> 29:56.211
- ONE.
- ONE?

29:56.294 --> 29:58.379
- ONE.

29:58.463 --> 30:02.091
{\an8}I'M SO ANGRY
THAT I HAVE TO DO BIOMECHANICAL.

30:02.175 --> 30:06.429
{\an8}I GOT THE HARDEST
TATTOO DESIGN OUT OF EVERYONE.

30:06.513 --> 30:08.014
{\an8}- BEST OF LUCK.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.682
{\an8}YOU'LL NEED IT.

30:09.766 --> 30:10.850
- CAROLINE
REALLY TRIED TO SCREW ME,

30:10.934 --> 30:13.728
BUT I'M GOING TO RISE
TO THE OCCASION,

30:13.811 --> 30:15.730
AND I'M GONNA BLOW HER
OUT OF THE WATER.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.984
- AW, YOU WENT FOR THE SKULL
AND THE ROSE.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.194
SKULLS AND ROSES AGAIN?

30:21.277 --> 30:24.656
{\an8}CAROLINE, DID YOU NOT LEARN
FROM THE LAST CHALLENGE?

30:24.739 --> 30:25.823
{\an8}IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO REDEEM YOURSELF,

30:25.907 --> 30:27.742
{\an8}YOU NEED TO GO BACK
TO THE DRAWING BOARD.

30:27.825 --> 30:30.828
- YOU HAVE TWO MORE HOURS
TO TATTOO.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.585
{\an8}- OBVIOUSLY I
SHOWED MY WEAKNESSES

30:37.669 --> 30:39.128
{\an8}VERY EARLY IN THE COMPETITION,

30:39.212 --> 30:40.922
{\an8}AND WHAT I HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW
IS JUST TRY TO STAY FOCUSED

30:41.005 --> 30:44.259
{\an8}AND SHOW
THAT I'M BETTER THAN TY'ESHA.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.635
- IF YOU HAD THE BALLS,

30:45.718 --> 30:47.220
YOU COULD HAVE PICKED SOMETHING
THAT, YOU KNOW,

30:47.303 --> 30:48.638
WE CAN GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH.
- YO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:48.721 --> 30:50.390
I SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID COLOR.

30:50.473 --> 30:52.517
{\an8}- LT GAVE ME LETTERING.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.768
{\an8}COME ON.

30:53.851 --> 30:55.395
{\an8}LIKE, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

30:55.478 --> 30:56.854
{\an8}EVERYONE LEARNED
HOW TO DO LETTERING

30:56.938 --> 30:58.481
{\an8}IN THE BEGINNING OF TATTOOING.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.817
LT THOUGHT
HE WAS REALLY SCREWING ME,

31:00.900 --> 31:01.859
BUT I'M DEFINITELY GONNA
HAVE THE LAST LAUGH.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.406
- THIS IS YOUR FINAL HOUR.

31:06.489 --> 31:08.533
ONE HOUR LEFT.

31:10.243 --> 31:13.413
- STILL SAY YOU NEED TO ADD SOME
FINGER WAVES TO THAT TATTOO.

31:13.496 --> 31:14.998
NUNEZ WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED.

31:15.081 --> 31:15.832
- OH, I THINK I'LL IMPRESS.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.041
THIS IS THE MOST INTENSE THING

31:17.125 --> 31:18.626
I'VE EVER HAD
TO DO IN MY TATTOO CAREER.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.004
{\an8}I'M GOING AGAINST MY RIVAL,

31:21.087 --> 31:23.339
{\an8}AND I'M HAVING TO DO
A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE TATTOO.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.340
{\an8}THIS IS HEAVY.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.466
{\an8}ME OR HIM.

31:26.884 --> 31:29.137
{\an8}- RYAN JUST PUT ME
IN THE BOTTOM,

31:29.220 --> 31:30.138
{\an8}SO I STILL HAVE TO GO

31:30.221 --> 31:31.306
{\an8}HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH HIM RIGHT NOW.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.349
{\an8}I'M GONNA SHOW HIM WHO'S BOSS.

31:33.433 --> 31:34.601
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

31:34.684 --> 31:35.935
- HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S REST.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.103
FEELING 110%.

31:37.186 --> 31:40.982
{\an8}- THE TURTLE SEEMS TO ONLY
HAVE TWO FLIPPERS,

31:41.065 --> 31:44.110
{\an8}SO THE TURTLE IS PERMANENTLY
GONNA TURN TO THE LEFT.

31:44.193 --> 31:44.986
{\an8}IT JUST LOOKS ROUGH FOR MARK.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.071
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON,

31:47.155 --> 31:48.281
{\an8}BUT HE IS STRUGGLING.

31:48.364 --> 31:50.742
- I DEFINITELY DIDN'T EXPECT
MYSELF HERE.

31:50.825 --> 31:52.744
- I DIDN'T EITHER.
I CAN'T LIE.

31:53.828 --> 32:00.627
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE,

32:00.710 --> 32:04.130
THAT'S IT, MACHINES DOWN,
NO MORE TATTOOING.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.090
- ALL RIGHT, CHECK IT OUT.

32:06.174 --> 32:08.509
- YO, YOU KILLED IT, MAN.

32:08.593 --> 32:09.510
WHAT'S UP?
NICE.

32:09.594 --> 32:10.511
- THAT'S BADASS, YO.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.180
- FEELING THAT?
- YEAH. HELL YEAH.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.182
- BIG, TOUGH TATTOO?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

32:14.265 --> 32:15.975
- LOOKS AWESOME.
- ALL RIGHT, SWEET.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.393
- LOOKS REAL GOOD.

32:17.477 --> 32:21.356
- CAROLINE'S TATTOO HAS HORRIBLE
LINES, HORRIBLE SHADING.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.441
THE DESIGN IS JUST GARBAGE.

32:23.524 --> 32:24.442
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE'LL WRAP YOU UP.

32:24.525 --> 32:27.695
- OKAY.
- THERE IS NO CHANCE IN HELL

32:27.779 --> 32:30.782
THAT CAROLINE IS GOING TO BEAT
ME IN THIS FACE-OFF CHALLENGE.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.452
- I'M DYING TO SEE WHAT
THE JUDGES ARE GONNA SAY

32:34.535 --> 32:36.287
'CAUSE I DID
A BETTER TATTOO THAN RYAN.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.665
HE TRIED TO THROW ME
UNDER THE BUS WITH SOME REALISM,

32:38.748 --> 32:40.083
AND I NAILED IT.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.584
- MARK,

32:41.668 --> 32:45.213
HONESTLY I THINK MY TATTOO'S
DEFINITELY UP THERE WITH YOURS.

32:45.296 --> 32:46.881
- UP THERE, LIKE,
RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT?

32:46.964 --> 32:48.508
UP THERE EXACTLY THE SAME LEVEL?
- LIKE, WE'RE NECK AND NECK.

32:48.591 --> 32:51.427
- THERE IS NO WAY.

32:51.511 --> 32:52.887
IF YOU THINK YOUR TATTOO
IS NECK AND NECK WITH THAT,

32:52.970 --> 32:56.474
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY [bleep]
INSANE.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.017
- YOUR DRAWINGS BLOW.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.352
- THAT'S IT. I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHAT ANYBODY HAS TO SAY.

32:59.435 --> 33:02.146
I DON'T HAVE TO PROVE MYSELF
TO ANY OF YOU GUYS.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.981
- WHY THE [bleep] SHOULDN'T
YOU GO HOME RIGHT NOW?

33:04.065 --> 33:05.608
YOU REALLY THINK YOU GOT THIS?
- YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT, MAN.

33:05.692 --> 33:06.859
IT'S JUST SO FUNNY.
- I AM BECAUSE I PUT IN

33:06.943 --> 33:09.153
MAD YEARS IN THIS [bleep].
I WAS WHERE YOU ARE.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.699
- SO HOW YOU GONNA FEEL
WHEN I BEAT YOUR ASS ON IT, HUH?

33:12.782 --> 33:15.076
HOW YOU GONNA FEEL?
I'M COMING FOR YOU.

33:15.159 --> 33:18.329
- YO, COME FOR ME.
YOU'RE GONNA GET SHUT DOWN.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.623
- I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATING ME

33:20.707 --> 33:22.041
AND NOT RESPECTING ME.

33:22.125 --> 33:22.875
DON'T BE MAD BECAUSE MY TATTOO
IS BETTER THAN YOURS.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.293
EVERYBODY'S SO CONFIDENT,

33:24.377 --> 33:27.213
BUT HONESTLY I HAVEN'T
SEEN ANYBODY'S TATTOO--

33:27.296 --> 33:28.923
- THAT'S HOW IT IS THOUGH.
THAT'S HOW IT IS.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.633
LOOK AT HOW MUCH EXPERIENCE IS
SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO RIGHT NOW.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.093
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT--
- THAT'S WHY

33:32.176 --> 33:32.969
WE'RE [bleep] CONFIDENT.
- THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.137
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep] ABOUT--

33:34.220 --> 33:36.431
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
HOW LOUD YOU GET!

33:36.514 --> 33:37.682
YOU WANT TO THINK YOU CAN
[bleep] TALK TO ME LIKE THAT?

33:37.765 --> 33:39.267
- LISTEN, YEAH! YEAH.
- YEAH?

33:39.350 --> 33:40.768
- YEAH. WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

33:40.852 --> 33:42.228
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- WELL, TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

33:42.311 --> 33:43.730
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.
- I'M TALKING TO YOU!

33:43.813 --> 33:45.064
I'M TALKING TO YOU!
I'M TALKING TO YOU, BRO.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.150
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO THE [bleep] I AM.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.276
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHO
THE [bleep] I AM!

33:48.359 --> 33:50.445
- OH!

33:50.528 --> 33:51.946
- JUST PART OF THE GAME, BUDDY.

33:52.029 --> 33:53.322
JUST PART OF THE GAME.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.157
YOU GOT TO GET OVER IT.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.963
- TODAY, YOUR RIVAL
ASSIGNED YOU A STYLE

34:09.047 --> 34:12.967
THAT THEY THOUGHT WOULD GET YOU
OUT OF THE COMPETITION FOR GOOD.

34:13.050 --> 34:15.553
LET'S SEE HOW YOU DID.

34:15.636 --> 34:17.513
CAROLINE, LET'S START WITH YOU.

34:19.474 --> 34:23.811
JULIA, WHY DID YOU ASSIGN
NEOTRADITIONAL FOR CAROLINE?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.688
- BECAUSE SHE HAS HORRIBLE
LINE WORK,

34:25.772 --> 34:28.024
AND SHE NEVER USES
THICK LINES.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.984
- WELL, CAROLINE,
I FEEL LIKE YOUR RIVAL

34:30.067 --> 34:32.195
DEFINITELY PICKED A WEAK POINT
TO SHOW US.

34:32.277 --> 34:33.780
DEFINITELY HAVE A STRUGGLE
WITH THE OUTLINE,

34:33.862 --> 34:34.739
YOUR ROSE SITS VERY FLAT,

34:34.822 --> 34:35.697
NO LEAVES AT ALL.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.534
THIS SAME TAN, BEIGE,

34:38.618 --> 34:40.161
SANDALWOOD,
WHATEVER THE [bleep]

34:40.244 --> 34:42.455
YOU WANT TO CALL IT COLOR THAT
YOU JUST PUT INTO THE SKULL,

34:42.538 --> 34:44.373
IT'S VERY LACKLUSTER.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.168
- JULIA.

34:50.713 --> 34:53.925
- THE FLOW IN THIS TATTOO
FOR ME IS A MAJOR HINDRANCE.

34:54.007 --> 34:55.967
THIS THING IS SO STIFF
AND RIGID, AND THE GEARS,

34:56.052 --> 34:57.303
THEY ALL HAVE TO BE PERFECT

34:57.386 --> 34:59.555
BECAUSE EACH PIECE
HAS TO INTERLINK WITH THE OTHER.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.515
- ONE OF THE THINGS
I REALLY LIKE ABOUT WHAT YOU

35:00.598 --> 35:02.725
DID IN THIS TATTOO
IS THE CONTRAST.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.143
WHERE YOU A LITTLE BIT
MISSED THE MARK

35:04.227 --> 35:06.020
IS IN THAT LIGHT SHADING.

35:06.103 --> 35:10.441
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO GET SMOOTH, SOFT GRAYS.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.027
IF YOU CAN'T DO SMOOTH,
SOFT GRAYS,

35:13.110 --> 35:14.237
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

35:15.613 --> 35:18.366
- MARK.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.829
- IT HAS A VERY PAINT
BY NUMBER FEEL TO IT.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.414
WHAT SURPRISED ME IS THAT
THE COLOR'S JUST NOT VIBRANT.

35:25.498 --> 35:26.707
THE COLOR'S NOT BRIGHT.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.501
THE LIGHT COLORS,
THE BLUES AND THE YELLOWS,

35:28.584 --> 35:30.211
AREN'T SOLID.
- THIS IS CRAZY.

35:30.294 --> 35:32.713
THIS IS THE MOST EMBARRASSING
THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.173
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M IN THE BOTTOM.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.758
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
YOU JUST LOOK NERVOUS.

35:35.842 --> 35:36.884
THIS ISN'T THE YOU
THAT I THINK

35:36.968 --> 35:38.803
MOST OF THE PEOPLE
IN THE ROOM KNOW ABOUT.

35:38.886 --> 35:40.763
- I KNOW MY HATERS
ARE VERY HAPPY RIGHT NOW,

35:40.847 --> 35:42.765
BUT I'M GONNA
PROVE THEM WRONG.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.562
- RYAN.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.188
- ESPECIALLY IN JAPANESE
TATTOOING,

35:49.272 --> 35:51.524
HOW CLEAN YOU DO SOMETHING
IS THE TRUE TEST

35:51.607 --> 35:54.944
OF WHETHER OR NOT
YOU'RE TECHNICALLY SOUND.

35:55.027 --> 35:56.320
- DUDE, THERE'S A LOT
OF HICCUPS.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.738
YOU CAN SEE IN THE LINE OF
THE LIPS WHERE IT HITS THE CHIN,

35:57.822 --> 35:59.073
PRETTY BIG HICCUP THERE.

35:59.156 --> 36:02.493
THE BLACK IN THE HAIR
IS NOT SOLID.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.245
- I STILL STAND BY IT
NO MATTER WHAT.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.080
WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE HICCUPS.
IT'S AN IMPERFECT SCIENCE.

36:06.163 --> 36:07.623
- THIS TATTOO ON JAPANESE DAY,

36:07.707 --> 36:09.709
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BEAT OUT
THE REST OF THE FIELD.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.088
- TY'ESHA.

36:16.757 --> 36:18.759
LT GAVE YOU CURSIVE LETTERING.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.386
- IT WAS A LITTLE
ON THE STUPID SIDE.

36:20.469 --> 36:23.097
THE FIRST THING YOU LEARN IN THE
TATTOOING INDUSTRY IS LETTERING.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.849
- I THINK THAT LT
MADE A WISE CHOICE

36:24.932 --> 36:26.350
IN GIVING YOU THIS CHALLENGE.

36:26.434 --> 36:29.103
LOOKING AT YOUR LETTERING UP
CLOSE, THERE'S NOT A SINGLE LOOP

36:29.186 --> 36:31.939
OR SWIRL
THAT WE DON'T SEE A HICCUP IN.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.274
- LET'S LOOK AT YOUR TWO Ls
IN BELLA.

36:33.357 --> 36:36.068
YOU SEE THAT REDNESS
AROUND THAT?

36:36.152 --> 36:37.111
- YES.
- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S FROM?

36:37.194 --> 36:37.904
A LOT OF PASSES.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.448
THIS IS A ONE PASS TATTOO

36:40.531 --> 36:42.825
WITH ANYBODY WHO'S PROFICIENT
AT DOING AN OUTLINE.

36:44.577 --> 36:47.580
- LT.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.582
- MY MAIN COMPLAINTS
WITH THIS IS THERE'S NO KIND

36:49.665 --> 36:50.625
OF DESIGN AND COMPOSITION.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.460
YOU DID JUST A FLOWER,
AND THEN YOU

36:52.543 --> 36:56.047
PUT THIS BLUE BORDER EQUALLY
AROUND THE ENTIRE TATTOO

36:56.130 --> 36:59.300
JUST BECAUSE YOU
NEEDED ANOTHER COLOR.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.636
- IF I GO OUTSIDE, AND I
SHOOT A PHOTO OF THIS FLOWER,

37:01.719 --> 37:02.261
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THIS.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.263
MAKE IT LOOK REAL.

37:04.347 --> 37:06.307
BEING AN INK MASTER
MEANS BEING ABLE TO DO IT ALL,

37:06.390 --> 37:08.267
SO IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT
PAST THIS,

37:08.351 --> 37:09.977
THE FUTURE DOESN'T LOOK BRIGHT.

37:15.274 --> 37:17.318
- IT'S TIME
TO SEE WHO WON EACH FACE-OFF.

37:17.401 --> 37:22.365
LT AND TY'ESHA,
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

37:26.911 --> 37:31.040
LT, YOU WON THE FACE OFF.

37:31.123 --> 37:31.999
- LT, YOU ENDED UP
WINNING THIS FACE-OFF

37:32.083 --> 37:34.293
BECAUSE WE HAD TO PICK A WINNER.

37:34.377 --> 37:37.338
I PERSONALLY COULDN'T SAY
WHICH EVIL

37:37.421 --> 37:40.549
WAS THE LESSER OR THE GREATER.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.009
- RYAN AND MARK,

37:42.093 --> 37:45.972
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED...

37:48.933 --> 37:50.768
RYAN, YOU WON THE FACE-OFF.

37:52.311 --> 37:53.354
- WE SAW FLAWS IN BOTH TATTOOS.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.357
DEFINITELY MORE VISIBLE MISTAKES
IN YOURS, MARK.

37:59.318 --> 38:02.321
- JULIA AND CAROLINE,
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED,

38:07.243 --> 38:09.954
JULIA, YOU WON THE FACE-OFF.

38:10.037 --> 38:12.415
- THE QUALITY OF TATTOOING
WAS A LITTLE MORE COHESIVE.

38:12.498 --> 38:14.709
IT'S NOT A HUGE LANDSLIDE
OF A WIN,

38:14.792 --> 38:16.168
BUT YOU PULLED IT OUT.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.461
- THANK YOU.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.755
- RYAN, JULIA,

38:19.839 --> 38:21.924
AND LT, YOU ARE SAFE,

38:22.008 --> 38:24.218
AND YOU CAN JOIN
THE OTHER ARTISTS.

38:31.892 --> 38:34.729
MARK, TY'ESHA, AND CAROLINE,

38:34.812 --> 38:36.647
PLEASE STEP FORWARD.

38:38.566 --> 38:39.984
YOUR RIVALS DEFEATED YOU,

38:40.067 --> 38:43.279
AND ANY ONE OF YOU
COULD BE ELIMINATED.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.448
TY'ESHA.
- IF YOU COULD SIT DOWN

38:45.531 --> 38:46.741
AND TATTOO RIGHT NOW, WOULD IT
LOOK COMPLETELY DIFFERENT?

38:46.824 --> 38:48.993
- ABSOLUTELY.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.536
THIS ISN'T ME.
THAT'S NOT MY WORK.

38:50.619 --> 38:53.039
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.749
- MARK.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.751
- THROUGHOUT THIS COMPETITION,
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF ARTISTS

38:56.834 --> 38:58.294
COME IN HERE
THAT WE KNOW ARE STRONG.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.963
THEY GET RATTLED FROM THE START
AND DO NOT GET TO OPERATE

39:01.047 --> 39:02.506
AT THE LEVEL OF ART
THAT WE'RE EXPECTING.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.925
- I'M GLAD I'M AT THE BOTTOM.
NOW I GOT THAT OVER WITH,

39:05.009 --> 39:06.761
AND YOU KNOW I'M THE BEST
OF THE WORST.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.596
I'M NOT HERE TO PUKE.
I'M HERE TO TATTOO.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.265
I KNOW I'M BETTER
THAN HALF THESE KOOKS HERE,

39:11.348 --> 39:12.600
AND THE OTHER BADASS GUYS,

39:12.683 --> 39:15.561
I'M READY TO GO
TOE-TO-TOE WITH.

39:15.644 --> 39:16.645
- CAROLINE.

39:16.729 --> 39:18.189
- THIS IS ONE
OF THOSE CRAZY SHAKEUPS

39:18.272 --> 39:20.733
WHERE EXPERIENCE IS GETTING
BEAT OUT BY INEXPERIENCE.

39:20.816 --> 39:22.318
BEING ABLE
TO OPERATE UNDER PRESSURE

39:22.401 --> 39:24.487
IS WHAT THIS COMPETITION
IS ALL ABOUT.

39:24.570 --> 39:25.821
- I'VE HAD A LOT--

39:25.905 --> 39:29.116
A LOT GOING ON
FOR A VERY LONG TIME,

39:29.200 --> 39:32.119
AND IT SORT OF TAKES YOU OUT.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.413
YOU KNOW,
YOU LET OTHER OBSTACLES IN LIFE

39:34.497 --> 39:35.915
GET IN YOUR WAY, YOU KNOW?

39:37.875 --> 39:39.335
- I'LL JUST SAY TO EVERYBODY,

39:39.418 --> 39:41.212
LEAVE YOUR WORRIES AT HOME
AND FOCUS ON THIS COMPETITION.

39:41.295 --> 39:42.630
IT'S A BEAT DOWN EVERY DAY,

39:42.713 --> 39:45.132
AND IT AIN'T GONNA CHANGE.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.051
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED,

39:52.223 --> 39:56.185
CAROLINE, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

39:56.268 --> 39:57.645
- THIS TATTOO'S NOT

39:57.728 --> 39:59.438
A MILLION TIMES WORSE
THAN YOUR RIVAL'S TATTOO,

39:59.522 --> 40:02.108
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE KIND
OF TATTOO THAT SOMEBODY'S GONNA

40:02.191 --> 40:03.984
WIN THIS COMPETITION
IS GONNA PUT OUT.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.821
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:09.198 --> 40:12.326
- I HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE
THAN A LOT OF THE ARTISTS HERE,

40:12.409 --> 40:16.831
AND I FEEL EMBARRASSED
TO BE THE FIRST TO GO.

40:16.914 --> 40:19.917
I'M GOING HOME BECAUSE
I DIDN'T BRING MY A-GAME.

40:24.004 --> 40:26.423
- ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF INK MASTER.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.508
- THAT'LL DO IT.
- I GOT THIS.

40:27.591 --> 40:30.970
- THIS CHALLENGE ISN'T OVER YET.
- WHAT?

40:31.053 --> 40:32.054
- THIS LAST CHALLENGE
WENT FROM REALLY NAKED

40:32.138 --> 40:34.765
TO REALLY NERVE WRACKING.

40:34.849 --> 40:35.850
- TRY NOT TO HAVE THEM QUICK,
LITTLE TWITCHES.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.977
- I DON'T WANT
YOU TO MESS UP THAT ASS.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.854
- THIS GUY IS PERMANENTLY
[bleep] UP FOR THE REST

40:39.937 --> 40:42.022
OF HIS LIFE.

40:42.106 --> 40:43.649
- [bleep] YOU BOTH.
- I MADE A SMART CHOICE.

40:43.732 --> 40:45.693
YOU DIDN'T.
- BITCH-ASS LIAR.

40:45.776 --> 40:48.028
YOU MOTHER[bleep]!

40:48.112 --> 40:49.405
- IT'S AN UNAPPEALING TATTOO.

40:49.488 --> 40:50.906
- IT'S NOT COOL TO DO
THAT TO YOUR CLIENT.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.033
- I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS
IS NOT EVERYBODY'S BEST WORK.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.035
GET READY TO GO HOME.
