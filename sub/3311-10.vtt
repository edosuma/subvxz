WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:08.008
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED

00:08.042 --> 00:10.644
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.647
HEY, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO TURN
THE POWER OFF BEFORE YOU DO THAT?

00:13.681 --> 00:15.449
- WHAT AM I, A GIRL?
- ( zaps )

00:15.483 --> 00:17.518
OW!

00:17.551 --> 00:20.788
- IT'S NOTHING.
- IF YOU HAD HAIR, IT'D BE STANDING UP.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.691
( laughing )

00:25.793 --> 00:28.629
- HI.
- YEAH, WE'RE JUST GONNA BE...

00:28.662 --> 00:31.732
- YOU KNOW.
- ( laughing )

00:33.701 --> 00:35.503
DID YOU SEE THAT?
DID YOU SEE THAT?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.671
I CAN ALREADY TELL YOU
REALLY LIKE THEM.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.307
AND DID YOU SEE ALL
THOSE PIERCINGS?

00:39.340 --> 00:41.642
I'M PRETTY SURE I COULD HEAR THE
WIND WHISTLING THROUGH THEM.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.545
AND THEY NEVER SAY HELLO. HOW
COME THEY NEVER SAY HELLO?

00:44.578 --> 00:47.047
BECAUSE THEY'RE TEENAGERS.
THAT'S WHAT THEY DON'T DO.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.417
YOU'RE ALSO NOT ALLOWED TO SIT
AT THEIR LUNCH TABLE EITHER.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.452
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M NOT
GONNA PUT UP WITH IT.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.221
I'M GOING UP TO LENNOX'S
ROOM RIGHT NOW.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.723
AND LECTURE HER IN FRONT OF HER FRIENDS?
THAT'LL BE REALLY EFFECTIVE.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.259
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
- YOU'RE ASKING ME?

00:58.292 --> 01:00.294
- I DON'T HAVE KIDS.
- NEITHER DO I.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.296
THEY WERE ABANDONED
BY MY SISTER.

01:02.330 --> 01:05.733
( huffs ) THAT WAS MY BIG
MISTAKE: HAVING A SISTER.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.735
RELAX, ALL RIGHT?
LENNOX IS A GOOD GIRL.

01:07.768 --> 01:10.238
YEAH, BUT I'M JUST WORRIED.
WHEN I WAS HER AGE,

01:10.271 --> 01:11.605
IF SOMEONE TOLD ME NOT TO DO IT,

01:11.639 --> 01:14.608
I WOULD SMOKE IT,
DRINK IT OR DATE IT.

01:14.642 --> 01:18.279
YES, WE KNOW. WHEN YOU GRADUATED
HIGH SCHOOL THEY RETIRED YOUR THONG.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.751
LOOK, THE FRIENDS YOU HAVE IN HIGH SCHOOL
ARE CRITICAL. GOOD FRIENDS INSPIRE YOU.

01:23.784 --> 01:27.555
BAD FRIENDS TEACH YOU HOW TO REPLACE
YOUR DAD'S SCOTCH WITH ICED TEA.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.291
MEL, I SERIOUSLY DOUBT ALL THE
POOR CHOICES YOU MADE IN LIFE

01:30.324 --> 01:33.361
- WERE BECAUSE YOU HAD A BAD FRIEND.
- I DIDN'T HAVE A BAD FRIEND.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.796
I WAS THE BAD FRIEND.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.433
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

01:39.467 --> 01:41.369
♪ WITH ME ♪

01:45.339 --> 01:48.742
HEY YOU. SURPRISE.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.612
- WHAT'S WITH THAT?
- LAST TIME I WORE IT, YOU SAID YOU LIKED IT

01:51.645 --> 01:55.249
- SO I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT IT.
- OH, IT'S SO PRETTY.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.585
DOES IT COME WITH AN AGENDA?

01:57.618 --> 02:00.488
A LITTLE BIT. THERE'S A
PARTY TONIGHT AT CITY HALL

02:00.521 --> 02:03.257
THAT IS GONNA BE OFF DA HOOK.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.627
ANYWAY, THERE'S GONNA BE
A BUNCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE

02:06.660 --> 02:08.596
AND SINCE YOU'RE A
YOUNG PEOPLE...

02:08.629 --> 02:11.432
THERE'S GONNA BE MUSIC.
CUTE BOYS?

02:11.465 --> 02:13.201
PROBABLY SUSHI.

02:13.234 --> 02:16.737
SURE... IF I CAN
BORROW SOME SHOES.

02:16.770 --> 02:20.341
LIKE MAYBE THOSE RED PEEP-TOES YOU SAID
YOU'D DIE BEFORE YOU'D LET ME WEAR?

02:20.374 --> 02:22.810
( forced laugh ) OKAY.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.345
COOL.

02:24.378 --> 02:28.582
BUT PANTYHOSE ARE A MUST!
CLEAN FEET, NOT TEEN FEET!

02:28.616 --> 02:31.619
- VERY SUBTLE, PUPPETMASTER.
- WHAT?

02:31.652 --> 02:34.154
IN THE OLD COUNTRY WHEN
MARRIAGES WERE ARRANGED,

02:34.188 --> 02:36.690
THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE
OF BEADS AND LIVESTOCK.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.892
THIS IS JUST BE A FUN EVENT
WITH THE ADDED BENEFIT

02:38.926 --> 02:41.362
THAT MAYBE LENNOX CAN
MAKE A FEW NEW FRIENDS.

02:41.395 --> 02:44.798
ONES THAT CAN'T BE CONVENIENTLY
THREADED TOGETHER.

02:51.539 --> 02:55.443
UH, YOU SAID SUSHI. I LIKE SUSHI.
WHAT IS THIS?

02:55.476 --> 02:57.645
IT'S PIGS IN A BLANKET.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.880
OH, MMM.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.650
IT'S E. COLI IN A BLANKET.
GIVE ME THAT.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.752
DON'T EVER EAT THOSE EVER.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.720
THIS IS ACTUALLY AWESOME.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.789
IT'S THE BEST FUNERAL
I'VE EVER BEEN TO.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.692
ARE YOU KIDDING? THIS IS
A VERY EXCITING EVENING.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.495
THEY'RE GIVING PUBLIC SERVICE AWARDS
TO THE "FUTURE LEADERS OF TOLEDO,"

03:14.528 --> 03:17.231
OR AS THEY'RE KNOWN, THE FLOTS.

03:17.265 --> 03:20.668
THEY USED TO BE CALLED THE
"TOLEADERS," BUT THEY WERE MOCKED.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.804
- NO, REALLY?
- GO, MIX, MINGLE.

03:23.837 --> 03:27.608
OH, SO THAT'S YOUR GAME. YOU'RE
PIMPING ME OUT TO NERDS.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.777
THIS IS A NICE GROUP
OF CIVIC-MINDED,

03:29.810 --> 03:32.446
CLEAN-CUT, OPTIMISTIC TEENS.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.715
SO YES, NERDS.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.351
BUT SOME OF THESE NERDS ARE HOT...
ISH.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.555
YEAH, SUPER FOXY. I'M
GONNA CALL A CAB.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.692
HI, ACCORDING TO THIS
DORKY NAMETAG, I'M BRETT.

03:44.725 --> 03:48.396
YOU MUST BE... "BITE ME."

03:48.429 --> 03:50.964
I'M LENNOX. MY AUNT
DRAGGED ME HERE.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.601
MEL BURKE, REPRESENTATIVE
FOR THE 7th DISTRICT

03:53.634 --> 03:55.769
AND OFFICIAL NIECE-DRAGGER.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.372
AND THE ENGINE BEHIND FUNDING FOR
THE TWO NEW ANIMAL SHELTERS.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.374
YES, I MIGHT BE THAT ENGINE.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.743
OH GOOD, I THOUGHT THEY WERE
ALL GONNA BE RAGING GEEKS.

04:02.776 --> 04:06.614
SO HAS THE DECISION BEEN MADE WHETHER
OR NOT THESE WILL BE NO-KILL SHELTERS?

04:06.647 --> 04:09.283
THAT IS A VERY ASTUTE
AND HANDSOME QUESTION.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.352
BUT I WILL HAVE TO GET
BACK TO YOU ON THAT LATER

04:11.385 --> 04:13.587
BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY WAITING
TO TALK TO THE MAYOR

04:13.621 --> 04:15.756
IF ONLY THOSE
BUTT-KISSING BROWN-NOSING

04:15.789 --> 04:18.659
ASS... OCIATES OF MINE BACK OFF.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.495
- LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT. HEY, MAYOR, GET OVER HERE!
- WHAT?

04:21.529 --> 04:23.431
- NO... OH MY GOSH.
- WHAT ARE YOU YELLING AT?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.466
UH, I'M SORRY, SIR.
SHOULD I CALL SECURITY?

04:25.499 --> 04:28.769
- NO, I THINK I CAN HANDLE HIM.
- DAD, MS. BURKE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.805
OH, YOU'RE HIS DAD!

04:31.839 --> 04:35.476
OF COURSE. BECAUSE A PERSON CAN
BE BOTH A MAYOR AND A DAD,

04:35.509 --> 04:37.978
AND IN THAT CASE THAT
WOULD BE YOU, MAYOR DAD.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.614
- I'LL INTRODUCE YOU AROUND.
- SO NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR EAR,

04:40.648 --> 04:42.783
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A
CRITICAL HEALTH INITIATIVE...

04:42.816 --> 04:45.719
LIGHTEN UP, COUNCILWOMAN,
THIS IS A PARTY.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.655
FORGET ABOUT WORK...

04:47.688 --> 04:50.424
AND EX-WIVES AND ALIMONY.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.794
ENJOY YOURSELF.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.664
SO I'M PROPOSING A MOBILE CLINIC
TO BRING FREE DENTAL CARE

04:56.697 --> 04:59.800
TO DOWNTOWN TOLEDO. I LIKE
TO CALL IT THE SMILEMOBILE.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.335
LOOK AT THAT.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.003
THE KIDS ARE HITTING IT OFF.

05:03.036 --> 05:07.307
THOSE ARE TOMORROW'S
TOLEADERS...

05:07.341 --> 05:09.743
TODAY.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.679
FILLS YOU WITH HOPE, DOESN'T IT?

05:11.712 --> 05:13.947
YUP, I AM COVERED IN HOPE BUMPS.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.316
OH, THANK YOU.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.386
OH.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.621
I JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.961
WHAT WAS THAT, LIKE FIVE MILES?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.398
FIVE MINUTES.

05:30.431 --> 05:33.567
GIVE IT TO ME IN TERMS
I CAN UNDERSTAND.

05:33.601 --> 05:37.070
HOW MANY COOKIES CAN I EAT NOW?

05:41.709 --> 05:43.544
LET'S GO.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.446
MRS. GELLER, HELLO.

05:45.479 --> 05:48.949
HELLO, MEL. MY, I
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU

05:48.982 --> 05:52.920
SINCE THAT INCIDENT WITH THE
ELECTION SIGN ON MY LAWN.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.989
MRS. GELLER, I WAS NOT
REMOVING MY OPPONENT'S SIGN;

05:56.023 --> 05:58.091
IT BLEW OVER IN THE WIND.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.529
THE WIND WHICH YOU
CREATED BY KICKING IT?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.431
HI, MRS. GELLER.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.333
- YOU LIVE ACROSS THE STREET, REMEMBER?
- I KNOW THAT.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.969
- I'M MEETING MY DATE.
- UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.639
I'M GOING TO CALL YOUR
DAUGHTER ELLEN RIGHT NOW.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.007
OOOH, THERE'S MY YOUNG MAN!

06:14.041 --> 06:17.678
WHO'S CRAZY NOW?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.913
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BLAST TONIGHT, MRS.
GELLER.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.550
HEY, WHAT'S WITH YOUR
GREAT-GRAND-COUGAR?

06:22.583 --> 06:26.420
THE SCHOOL HAS THIS DUMB RULE
THAT IN ORDER TO "GRADUATE"

06:26.454 --> 06:29.356
I NEED 40 HOURS OF COMMUNITY
SERVICE BY THE END OF THE TERM.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.959
WHICH IS MONDAY. MRS.
GELLER'S DAUGHTER NEEDED

06:31.992 --> 06:34.595
SOMEONE TO KEEP HER COMPANY
WHILE SHE WENT TO VEGAS.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.130
SINCE SHE'S GOING TO BE STAYING FOR
DINNER, I'LL SET ANOTHER PLATE.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.132
OH, I NEED 40 HOURS.
SHE'S HERE TILL MONDAY.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.068
OH, LUCKY US.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.705
COME ON, MRS. G, YOU PROMISED YOU'D
TEACH ME HOW TO PLAY PINOCHLE.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.508
HOPEFULLY IT'S MORE
FUN THAN IT SOUNDS.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.042
IT'S NOT.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.781
- I'M GOING TO THE MALL.
- WAIT... WAIT A SECOND.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.083
I DON'T THINK I LIKE THE IDEA OF
YOU WANDERING AROUND AIMLESSLY

06:56.116 --> 06:57.685
WITH YOUR COLORFUL
GROUP OF FRIENDS.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.488
AS IT HAPPENS, I'LL BE
WANDERING AROUND AIMLESSLY

07:00.521 --> 07:02.089
WITH BRETT AND THE OTHER FLOTS.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.558
OH, THEN FANTASTIC.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.695
GO, WANDER SUCCESSFULLY.
FLOT TILL YOU DROP.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.429
WILL DO.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.404
OOH, SMELLS DELICIOUS!
BANANAS FOSTER?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.673
BACK OFF MY BANANA, LADY.

07:19.707 --> 07:23.577
THESE ARE PERSONAL CONSUMPTION ONLY.
FIRE IN THE HOLE, EVERYBODY.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.747
WHOO... WHOA! WHOO!

07:26.780 --> 07:29.783
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
YEAH.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.719
WHOO!

07:33.654 --> 07:35.589
- GOOD NIGHT.
- HEY... HEY HEY HEY, WAIT.

07:35.623 --> 07:38.091
COME BACK OVER HERE. SO
HOW DID EVERYTHING GO

07:38.125 --> 07:39.960
WITH THOSE CRAZY COOL FLOT KIDS?

07:39.993 --> 07:41.662
COME ON, GIRLFRIEND, SHARE.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.797
I JUST, YOU KNOW,

07:43.831 --> 07:45.666
I DIDN'T FIT IN. GOOD NIGHT.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.100
WHOA WHOA, MAYBE NOT RIGHT AWAY,

07:47.134 --> 07:49.570
BUT YOU SHOULD GIVE THOSE
KIDS ANOTHER CHANCE.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.572
MAYBE START A WICKED
COOL STUDY GROUP.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.741
BURKE, YOU KNOW THAT LINE
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO CROSS?

07:53.774 --> 07:56.710
IT'S RIGHT THERE BEHIND YOU. SO
JUST SCOOCH BACK A LITTLE BIT.

07:56.744 --> 08:00.614
THEY JUST AREN'T THE KIND OF PEOPLE
I'M INTERESTED IN SPENDING TIME WITH.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.449
LENNOX, THAT IS SO JUDGMENTAL.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.518
YOU SHOULD BE OPEN TO
TRYING NEW THINGS.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.554
REALLY REALLY? LIKE
DRINKING AND DRUGS?

08:06.587 --> 08:09.256
FINE, AUNT MEL, NEXT TIME I'LL
STICK AROUND FOR A SHOT AND A HIT.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.871
"SHOT" "HIT"? OKAY, WHAT
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:23.904 --> 08:27.207
I WANT DETAILS...
NAMES, PLACES, TIMES.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.178
WELL, AFTER THE MALL, A BUNCH
OF THOSE CRAZY COOL FLOT KIDS

08:31.211 --> 08:33.180
WANTED TO GET DRUNK AND HIGH.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.948
OH MY GOSH, WHAT ABOUT BRETT?

08:34.982 --> 08:37.117
- OH, HE WAS PRETTY UPSET...
- GOOD.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.087
...BECAUSE HE BROUGHT ALL THE
BEER AND NOBODY PAID HIM BACK.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.690
AND THEN HE GOT PISSED BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WANT TO DRINK.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.158
OH, HE'S GONNA GET
PAID BACK ALL RIGHT.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.728
SO I CALLED A CAB.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.898
- WAS I WRONG?
- NO! YOU WERE VERY VERY RIGHT.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.901
- SO GOOD NIGHT?
- YES, GOOD NIGHT.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.806
OKAY, SO HERE'S MY PLAN:
STEP ONE, FIND BOY.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.774
STEP TWO, BEAT BOY SENSELESS.

09:00.808 --> 09:04.812
STEP THREE, ENJOY THE SATISFACTION
OF STEPS ONE AND TWO.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.114
YEAH, I HAVE AN
EVEN SIMPLER PLAN.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.617
LET BOY HANG WITH HIS CROWD AND
BE GLAD LENNOX DIDN'T WANT

09:09.650 --> 09:11.284
- TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM.
- WHAT?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.854
THIS LITTLE DWEEB OFFERS A
15-YEAR-OLD DRUGS AND ALCOHOL

09:13.887 --> 09:15.723
- AND HE'S GONNA GET AWAY WITH IT?
- NOTHING HAPPENED.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.725
LENNOX TOOK CARE OF HERSELF.
THIS IS A GOOD THING.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.559
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THIS GUY IS STILL OUT THERE.

09:19.593 --> 09:23.063
OUT THERE WHAT? OFFERING
GIRLS BEER THEY CAN REFUSE?

09:23.096 --> 09:25.198
I'M PROTECTING LENNOX,
BUT I SEE YOU HAVE A LOT

09:25.232 --> 09:27.768
OF OTHER THINGS GOING ON
HERE, LIKE WORK AND STUFF.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.638
WAIT, SO YOU THINK I'M BACKING OFF
BECAUSE HE'S THE MAYOR'S SON?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.305
- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD THINK?
- NO!

09:32.339 --> 09:35.075
THIS IS THE WAY I'D HANDLE THE
SITUATION WITH ANYONE'S SON.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.910
YOU THINK I DON'T
CARE ABOUT LENNOX?

09:36.944 --> 09:39.079
SHE'S UP THERE RIGHT
NOW, CLEAN AND SOBER

09:39.112 --> 09:42.716
WITH HER HONOR INTACT. I DON'T KNOW
HOW I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH MYSELF.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.718
THAT BOY'S GONNA PAY...

09:44.752 --> 09:46.854
WITH BLOOD.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.657
OKAY, JOE, YOU KNOW THAT
LINE YOU SHOULDN'T CROSS?

09:49.690 --> 09:52.926
I CAN'T EVEN SEE IT FROM HERE. YOU
SHOULD SCOOCH BACK ABOUT A MILE OR TWO.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.331
GOOD NIGHT, MEL DEAR.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.734
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. GELLER.

10:00.768 --> 10:04.337
ALL RIGHT, DEAR.

10:04.371 --> 10:08.108
AM I A SCRAPPY LITTLE TRAMP

10:08.141 --> 10:11.679
WITH A BOWLER HAT
AND A MUSTACHE?

10:11.712 --> 10:14.882
UH, NO. AM I WILL SMITH?

10:14.915 --> 10:17.217
UGH, I WISH.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.693
- HEY, JOE.
- HEY.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.361
JOE! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:28.395 --> 10:29.997
I'M HERE TO TALK TO THE
MAYOR, WORK THINGS OUT.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.700
- YOU CAN'T JUST WALK IN THERE.
- I KNOW, I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.902
HOW? I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET
ON HIS CALENDAR FOR WEEKS.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.709
HEY, LOIS.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.244
PRETTY... PENCIL CUP.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.379
OH, THANK YOU, MS. BURKE.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.116
LISTEN, THIS GENTLEMAN DOESN'T
REALLY NEED TO SEE THE MAYOR,

10:49.149 --> 10:51.051
- SO HIS APPOINTMENT IS CANCELED.
- OKAY.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.987
- NO IT'S NOT.
- OKAY.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.957
LOOK, THE MAYOR NEEDS TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, MEL.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.860
NO, HE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON. HE'S THE MAYOR.

10:59.893 --> 11:03.363
WHAT IS GOING ON OUT HERE?
I'M TRYING TO TAKE A NAP.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.233
- WHO ARE YOU?
- JOE LONGO, SIR.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.169
- OH, ARE YOU THE COUNCILWOMAN'S HUSBAND?
- GOD NO.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.205
I'M HER... NANNY.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.908
OKAY.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.811
WHY DON'T YOU BOTH COME IN?

11:17.845 --> 11:19.646
( sighs ) LOIS, HOLD MY CALLS

11:19.679 --> 11:22.415
AND GET ME A FALAFEL.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.984
OKAY.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.193
SO? I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.764
WELL, SIR, THERE'S NO EASY
WAY TO BRING THIS UP...

11:36.797 --> 11:39.132
WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH LENNOX AND YOUR SON AT THE PARTY.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.836
- OKAY, ONE EASY WAY.
- OH, THE PARTY ISSUE.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.972
YEAH, I GUESS WE CAN'T DODGE IT.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.408
IT'S ALWAYS TOUGH WHEN YOUR OWN CHILD
IS INVOLVED IN SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.143
I FEEL FOR YOU, COUNCILWOMAN.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.212
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU TOOK
IN THOSE TROUBLED KIDS

11:52.245 --> 11:54.915
- AFTER THEIR PARENTS ABANDONED THEM.
- PLEASE...

11:54.948 --> 11:56.416
DON'T MAKE ME OUT TO BE A HERO.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.418
I WASN'T GONNA.

11:58.451 --> 12:01.688
LOOK, I'M SURE YOU'RE DOING
THE VERY BEST YOU CAN.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.125
BUT TEENAGERS WITH ISSUES CAN
BE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.828
THEY ACT OUT WITH
ROWDY BEHAVIOR,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.763
THEY USE DRUGS,
EXPERIMENT WITH SEX...

12:09.797 --> 12:11.698
I'M SORRY, WHEN YOU SAY

12:11.731 --> 12:14.134
"TEENAGERS WITH ISSUES,"
WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.936
LENNOX.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.305
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING SHE
SUPPLIED THE ALCOHOL.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.173
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?
- JOE.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.409
- WE KNOW THERE WAS ALCOHOL THERE...
- MY SON BRETT

12:22.442 --> 12:24.878
ALSO REPORTED THAT SHE WAS...

12:24.912 --> 12:28.148
- OOH, HOW CAN I PUT THIS?
- VERY CAREFULLY.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.251
THROWING HERSELF AT THE BOYS.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.220
DID YOU REALLY JUST SAY THAT?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.923
THAT JUST DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE LENNOX.

12:35.956 --> 12:39.226
YOU NEED TO PULL YOUR HEAD
OUT OF YOUR KEISTER...

12:39.259 --> 12:41.194
BEFORE THAT LITTLE
MILK SHAKE SUCCEEDS

12:41.228 --> 12:43.396
IN GETTING ONE OF THOSE
FINE YOUNG MEN IN TROUBLE.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.398
YOU SHOULD REALLY JUST
STOP RIGHT THERE.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.500
SHE MAY BE WILLING TO
THROW HER LIFE AWAY,

12:47.534 --> 12:50.904
BUT SHE SHOULDN'T DRAG ONE OF THOSE
FINE YOUNG MEN DOWN WITH HER.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.372
( laughs )

12:52.405 --> 12:54.875
- SON OF A...
- JOE, JOE, JOE!

12:54.908 --> 12:56.944
LOIS, SECURITY! LOIS, LOIS!

12:58.879 --> 13:01.448
YOU KNOW THESE NANNIES TODAY WITH
THEIR HIGH LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.226
HEY, SO,

13:13.260 --> 13:16.029
GOOD NEWS... THE MAYOR'S NOT
GOING TO PRESS ANY CHARGES.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.831
YOU KNOW WHY? HE
FELT SORRY FOR US

13:17.865 --> 13:19.900
BECAUSE WE HAVE A TEENAGE SEX
ADDICT LIVING IN OUR HOUSE.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.235
YOU'RE LUCKY I DIDN'T
TAKE THAT GUY'S HEAD OFF.

13:22.269 --> 13:25.839
- JOE, YOU ACTED CRAZY.
- OH, I WASN'T ACTING.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.441
I HAD TO PROTECT LENNOX
FROM ALL THESE LIES.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.879
YEAH, ABOUT THOSE LIES... I HAD
THIS SMALL UNSETTLING FEELING,

13:31.912 --> 13:35.115
AS YOU WERE SAILING ACROSS THE
MAYOR'S DESK LIKE A BALD EAGLE...

13:37.150 --> 13:40.888
HOW DO WE KNOW... I MEAN HOW CAN WE BE
SURE THAT LENNOX IS TELLING THE TRUTH?

13:40.921 --> 13:43.090
BECAUSE SHE'S LENNOX.

13:43.123 --> 13:46.259
LISTEN, I LIED PRETTY MUCH EVERY
MOMENT OF MY TEENAGE LIFE.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.862
LYING IS LIKE EYESHADOW
TO TEENAGE GIRLS.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.464
ONCE THEY DISCOVER IT,
THEY USE IT ALL THE TIME.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.103
- SO YOU DON'T THINK SHE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH?
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.537
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S POSSIBLE.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.240
IF SHE WASN'T...
AND THEN I WENT...

14:00.273 --> 14:03.443
OH BOY.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.812
DID I JUST ASSAULT THE
MAYOR FOR NO REASON?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.581
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING LENNOX WAS LYING.
I'M JUST SAYING...

14:08.615 --> 14:10.884
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.153
CAN YOU FIGURE IT OUT BEFORE
YOU START TO SAY SOMETHING?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.555
IT'D BE REALLY HELPFUL TO
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.892
OKAY, THE TRUTH IS WE'RE JUST NOT
GOING TO KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.028
OH, WE'RE GONNA KNOW.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.333
MEL, GET IN HERE.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.168
- OH, THIS IS WRONG!
- GET IN HERE,

14:28.201 --> 14:29.970
COME ON! WHAT IS YOUR PLAN, HUH?

14:30.003 --> 14:32.505
WHAT, LIVE WITH THE DOUBT AND
THE CONSTANT GNAWING ANXIETY?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.541
YEAH, YOU GET USED TO IT. OKAY?

14:34.574 --> 14:38.011
THERE'S NO PROBLEM TOO BIG THAT YOU
CAN'T SWEEP UNDER AN ENORMOUS RUG.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.013
PREFERABLY WITH A VODKA BROOM.

14:40.047 --> 14:43.016
MAYBE YOU CAN LIVE LIKE THAT, BUT
I CAN'T, ALL RIGHT? I NEED PROOF.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.553
OKAY, HERE WE GO. NOW LOOK,
HER INBOX IS ALREADY OPEN.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.855
NO. IF WE READ HER EMAILS,
WE'RE VIOLATING HER TRUST.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.890
SHE'S NEVER GONNA KNOW
WE'RE VIOLATING HER TRUST.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.926
SO FROM HER PERSPECTIVE,
SHE'S UNVIOLATED.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.561
- INVIOLATE.
- REALLY?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.629
YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT NOW?

14:56.663 --> 14:59.266
EXCUSE ME. HELLO, DEAR.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.335
- HI.
- IS THE KITCHEN STILL OPEN?

15:02.369 --> 15:05.505
YEAH, GIVE ME A MINUTE. I'LL COME
DOWN AND COOK YOU SOMETHING.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.909
- WHAT, DOES SHE THINK SHE'S ON A CRUISE SHIP?
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.478
NINE HOURS AND SHE'S GONE, OKAY?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.413
HOW ABOUT THIS? HOW ABOUT THIS:

15:13.446 --> 15:15.382
I'LL OPEN UP THE EMAIL,
BUT I WON'T READ IT.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.450
THEN YOU CAN CASUALLY WALK
BY AND YOU CAN READ IT.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.386
YEAH, HOW IS THAT NOT
VIOLATING HER TRUST?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.554
OH, IT'S DEFINITELY VIOLATING
HER TRUST BIG TIME.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.590
- I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS.
- REALLY?

15:23.623 --> 15:25.325
OKAY WELL...

15:25.358 --> 15:27.560
- TOO LATE.
- NO!

15:27.594 --> 15:29.629
OKAY, THIS ONE'S
ABOUT THE PARTY.

15:29.662 --> 15:33.066
REALLY? WHAT IS "AYSOS"?

15:33.100 --> 15:37.270
- ARE YOU STUPID OR SOMETHING?
- I'M SORRY, I DON'T SPEAK THIS NET LINGO.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.974
A.Y.S.O.S.... "ARE YOU
STUPID OR SOMETHING?"

15:42.075 --> 15:43.710
OH, THANK YOU.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.280
- OKAY, HERE'S ONE FROM BRETT.
- NO!

15:47.314 --> 15:48.982
OH, WHAT?

15:49.016 --> 15:52.019
"DON'T NARC ME OUT, LENNOX. IF
MY DAD FINDS OUT I WAS BUYING,

15:52.052 --> 15:54.021
HE'LL TAKE AWAY MY CAR."

15:54.054 --> 15:56.589
THAT'S GREAT! THAT MEANS
LENNOX WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.026
- OH, WHAT A RELIEF.
- I TOLD YOU.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.628
Lennox: ANYBODY HOME?

16:08.635 --> 16:11.004
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN MY ROOM?

16:11.038 --> 16:13.106
JUST CHECKING OUT THESE LIGHTS.
SEEING HOW MANY

16:13.140 --> 16:15.208
COMPACT FLUORESCENTS WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO PUT IN HERE.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.677
- ONE, TWO...
- THREE.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.679
- WE'RE DONE.
- YEP, ALL GOOD.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.023
HEY LENNOX, YOU GOT A LOT
OF HOMEWORK TONIGHT?

16:30.057 --> 16:32.059
- EH.
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?

16:32.092 --> 16:34.361
YEAH, SHE KNOWS WE SNOOPED.
THAT'S IT, I'M CONFESSING.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.330
COME HERE! YOU'RE NEVER GONNA DO IT
AGAIN, SO DON'T GO RUIN THE RELATIONSHIP.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.232
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT!

16:39.266 --> 16:41.501
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'D JUST START
EVERY DAY WITH THAT PREMISE,

16:41.534 --> 16:43.636
YOUR LIFE WOULD JUST
BE SO MUCH EASIER.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.338
DINNER'S READY, EVERYBODY.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.109
HERE WE GO, ALL RIGHTY.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.644
YUM.

16:51.678 --> 16:55.382
BEFORE WE BEGIN, I WOULD
LIKE TO SAY GRACE.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.217
OH.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.589
DEAR GOD, PLEASE
BLESS THIS BOUNTY

17:02.622 --> 17:04.457
AND THESE GENEROUS PEOPLE

17:04.491 --> 17:06.426
WHO HAVE TAKEN ME
INTO THEIR HOME...

17:06.459 --> 17:08.595
TEMPORARILY.

17:08.628 --> 17:11.564
BUT NOT FOR LESS THAN 40 HOURS.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.434
...AND PLEASE FORGIVE
OUR DAILY TRESPASSES,

17:14.467 --> 17:17.737
PARTICULARLY EARLIER TODAY
WHEN JOE AND MEL TRESPASSED

17:17.770 --> 17:20.707
INTO LENNOX'S ROOM
AND READ HER EMAIL.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.710
- WHAT?!
- OH, SHE'S NOT ALL THERE.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.812
THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.682
YOU TWO WERE SNOOPING
AND YOU KNOW IT.

17:29.716 --> 17:34.154
AND YOU ATE AN ENTIRE BAG
OF SLIM JIMS FOR BREAKFAST,

17:36.189 --> 17:39.259
AND YOU WERE LOOKING AT
BOOBIES ON THE INTERNET.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.534
WOW, NOBODY LEFT STANDING.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.068
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

17:49.102 --> 17:51.204
I THOUGHT YOU PEOPLE TRUSTED ME.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.473
( huffs )

17:54.607 --> 17:56.476
AMEN.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.114
- ( cell phone beeps )
- UGH, ANOTHER TEXT FROM LENNOX.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.650
- "I'M BRUSHING MY TEETH."
- ( beeps )

18:03.683 --> 18:05.818
- "I'M RINSING."
- ( beeps )

18:05.852 --> 18:07.454
"I'M SPITTING."

18:07.487 --> 18:09.722
WOW, SHE CAN TYPE THAT
FAST WITH ONE HAND?

18:09.756 --> 18:12.659
YEAH, SHE WON'T TALK TO ME, BUT
SHE'S TEXTS ME EVERY SIX SECONDS

18:12.692 --> 18:15.495
TO PROTEST HER LACK OF PRIVACY.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.831
- ( beeps )
- "I HAD AN IMPURE THOUGHT ABOUT JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT."

18:21.401 --> 18:24.337
THIS IS GREAT. YOU KNOW, I ONLY
READ HER EMAIL BECAUSE YOU MADE ME.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.773
AND THAT SENTENCE SHOULD HAVE ENDED
WITH, "AND I THANK YOU, JOE.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.608
I THANK YOU FOR
GETTING ME THE TRUTH.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.643
I NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE IT
BECAUSE I'M A BIG WUSS."

18:30.677 --> 18:34.281
THANK YOU, JOE, FOR FIXING
EVERYTHING SO THAT LENNOX HATES ME.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.616
YOU JUST HAVE THIS
PATHOLOGICAL NEED TO BE LIKED.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.751
- CLEARLY YOU DON'T.
- NO!

18:38.785 --> 18:40.787
YOU GOTTA REPAIR THE RUPTURE.
SO YOU GO UP THERE

18:40.820 --> 18:43.656
AND YOU APOLOGIZE AND START MEND
YOUR RELATIONSHIP. YOU CAN DO IT.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.193
( sighs ) YOU KNOW, I
DON'T NEED TO BE LIKED.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.195
MRS. GELLER HATES ME AND
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.697
WHY DOES SHE HATE ME?

18:52.765 --> 18:54.567
LENNOX, CAN I COME IN?

18:54.601 --> 18:56.102
( beeps )

18:56.135 --> 18:58.205
"OPENING THE DOOR."

19:00.607 --> 19:02.875
OKAY, YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT.
YOU CAN STOP TEXTING ME NOW.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.877
OH REALLY? BECAUSE I
THOUGHT YOU NEEDED TO KNOW

19:04.911 --> 19:08.215
WHAT I'M DOING EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY
AND NIGHT SINCE YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.350
HEY LOOK, I WAS 15 ONCE TOO

19:10.383 --> 19:12.118
AND I DID CRAZY THINGS

19:12.151 --> 19:15.722
AND I LIED LIKE A BASEBALL
PLAYER IN FRONT OF CONGRESS.

19:15.755 --> 19:19.626
BUT I DIDN'T LIE. I'M
NOT YOU, AUNT MEL.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.562
YOU KNOW, THAT'S TRUE.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.697
FOR STARTERS YOU'RE A
LOT SMARTER THAN I WAS.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.667
I MADE SOME BAD CHOICES AND I'M
NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT BACK THEN.

19:27.700 --> 19:31.404
TODAY WHEN I READ YOUR EMAIL...
THAT JOE OPENED...

19:31.438 --> 19:33.840
I VIOLATED YOUR TRUST.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.443
YOU SURE DID.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.711
SO HOW ABOUT I EVEN THE SCORE?

19:38.745 --> 19:41.381
I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.583
IT'D BETTER BE A GOOD ONE.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.752
OH, IT'S A GOOD ONE.

19:45.785 --> 19:49.389
ALL RIGHT, I HAVE A
LITTLE CUTE TATTOO

19:49.422 --> 19:51.391
ON MY LEFT BUTT CHEEK

19:51.424 --> 19:54.494
THAT SAYS, "MEL AND
SIMON FOREVER."

19:54.527 --> 19:56.729
- SO?
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHO SIMON IS.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.598
( laughs )

19:58.631 --> 20:01.401
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

20:01.434 --> 20:05.538
SERIOUSLY, LENNOX, I DO TRUST YOU AND
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE WHAT WE HAVE.

20:05.572 --> 20:08.408
I KNOW. AND IT MEANS A
LOT, YOU TELLING ME THAT.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.478
SO SIMON WILL BE
OUR LITTLE SECRET?

20:11.511 --> 20:12.879
PINKY PROMISE?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.350
GOOD NIGHT, LEN.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.851
GOOD NIGHT, AUNT MEL.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.187
SO HOW'D IT GO?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.323
GOOD. PRETTY GOOD.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.658
I THINK WE'VE REESTABLISHED
OUR BOND OF TRUST.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.498
I JUST GOT A MESSAGE
FROM LENNOX.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.967
"MEL BURKE HAS A GUY'S
NAME TATTOOED ON HER BUTT
