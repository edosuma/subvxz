00:14.200 --> 00:15.600
Son of a bitch!

00:18.400 --> 00:22.160
Murderer!

00:24.440 --> 00:27.640
COURTHOUSE

00:28.320 --> 00:29.200
<i>Hi, Antonio.</i>

00:29.280 --> 00:32.440
<i>Javier, your brother</i>
<i>has revised his statement today, okay?</i>

00:32.520 --> 00:35.880
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-The motorcycle story wasn't full-proof.</i>

00:35.960 --> 00:38.480
<i>He's said that there was a third person</i>
<i>and a car, okay?</i>

00:38.560 --> 00:40.280
MIGUEL'S LAWYER TO JAVIER
FEB 14, 2009

00:40.360 --> 00:42.280
<i>But beyond that, is it the same version?</i>

00:42.360 --> 00:44.920
<i>Yes, from then on,</i>
<i>it's the same version, so it's okay.</i>

00:45.000 --> 00:47.840
<i>But of course,</i>
<i>the one who drove the car is 15.</i>

00:47.920 --> 00:48.800
<i>Sorry?</i>

00:48.880 --> 00:51.000
<i>The one who drove the car is 15 years old.</i>

00:51.080 --> 00:53.600
<i>I think his name is "Cuco."</i>

00:58.520 --> 01:00.800
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

01:40.840 --> 01:44.240
"YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW I SAW YOU EAT THEM THREE AT A TIME?"

01:44.320 --> 01:48.360
"IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS EATING THEM
TWO AT A TIME AND YOU KEPT QUIET."

01:52.200 --> 01:56.200
When Marta was born,
she looked a bit yellow

01:56.280 --> 01:58.200
because of a bilirubin problem,

01:58.280 --> 02:00.680
so they put her in an incubator.

02:00.760 --> 02:05.600
I remember I had just bought
a video camera,

02:05.680 --> 02:09.560
and since we had
to watch over her day and night...

02:09.640 --> 02:10.480
MARTA'S FATHER

02:10.560 --> 02:11.400
...I recorded her.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.360
We were longing for a child
because we'd been married for a year,

02:22.440 --> 02:26.480
and we'd been saying
that the house was big

02:26.560 --> 02:29.440
and we needed to hear some laughter there.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.320
She had a very happy childhood.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.840
She was always coddled.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.200
She was our first niece, so...

02:42.280 --> 02:44.120
MARTA'S UNCLE

02:44.200 --> 02:47.160
My wife and I took her
to the movies for the first time.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.960
We played at the beach a lot.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.840
She was a child that you couldn't help
but love. She was so sweet, so loving.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.240
That's what

02:57.240 --> 03:00.720
makes the loss so much deeper, you know?

03:02.400 --> 03:06.560
My first granddaughter
was wonderful, loving...

03:07.080 --> 03:11.800
With her grandad, she was a sweetheart.
She was the best thing in my life.

03:12.440 --> 03:16.520
Those happy moments stay with you,
and those moments are a gift from her.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.160
I think that whenever you lose someone,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.880
you should remember
the good times you had together.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.520
Look, look at the camera. Hello!

03:25.480 --> 03:26.960
Hello!

03:30.560 --> 03:34.600
<i>Breaking news in the disappearance</i>
<i>of Marta del Castillo from Seville.</i>

03:34.680 --> 03:38.360
<i>The Civil Guard has now begun searching</i>
<i>the Guadalquivir River for her.</i>

03:39.480 --> 03:41.560
FEBRUARY 14, 2009

03:41.640 --> 03:44.400
When Miguel Carcaño
confessed that he'd killed Marta,

03:44.480 --> 03:48.000
I spoke with the Minister of the Interior
and I told him

03:48.080 --> 03:51.560
that I was going to get the army involved.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.880
This was probably the beginning

03:55.960 --> 03:59.160
of the largest search operation
for a person ever.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.520
POLICE

04:02.520 --> 04:05.720
It's a really difficult river,

04:05.800 --> 04:08.440
a river with really murky waters,

04:09.240 --> 04:13.560
and a layer of mud at the bottom
that can be as deep as two meters.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.880
You can't see anything in that river.

04:15.960 --> 04:19.720
The divers were searching blindly
for Marta's body.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.600
WE ARE ALL MARTA

04:23.760 --> 04:28.160
First of all, I'd like to thank
all the security forces,

04:28.240 --> 04:30.120
everyone that is doing all they can

04:30.640 --> 04:33.920
to locate my daughter's body,
which I hope will be found.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.440
My priority is to be at home,

04:35.520 --> 04:39.200
so that when they find my daughter's body,
I'll be the first to know,

04:39.280 --> 04:40.960
and so I can be with my wife.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.520
The search in the river
was a very stressful time.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.080
I remember
I was in contact with several people

04:48.160 --> 04:50.520
from the state security forces,

04:50.600 --> 04:54.760
and they told me, "The river always
returns the bodies. It always turns up."

04:54.840 --> 04:58.240
POLICE THROW THREE DEAD PIGS INTO RIVER
IN SEARCH OF CLUES ABOUT MARTA

04:58.320 --> 05:00.560
ALL THREE FLOAT AND BECOME STUCK

05:00.640 --> 05:02.800
They used pigs, with GPS,

05:02.880 --> 05:04.960
because from a biological perspective,

05:05.040 --> 05:08.320
in water, they behave
in a similar way to a human body, right?

05:08.400 --> 05:13.800
They attempted
to do a simulation of January 24th,

05:13.880 --> 05:16.480
when Miguel Carcaño
said they threw her in the river.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.520
It didn't provide any real answers,

05:20.040 --> 05:22.680
because the experiment
was done several times,

05:22.760 --> 05:24.640
and it produced inconsistent results.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.360
640 kilometers of the area
have been scoured on foot,

05:33.440 --> 05:35.320
on both sides of the river.

05:35.400 --> 05:40.680
The National Police helicopter
has done more than 80 hours of flying.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.360
Dogs are searching the area,

05:42.440 --> 05:44.800
and more than 50 dives
have been carried out

05:44.880 --> 05:48.600
by divers from the National Police,
the Civil Guard,

05:48.680 --> 05:50.600
and the Military Emergencies Unit.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.840
<i>Good afternoon, Antonio.</i>

05:57.920 --> 06:00.800
<i>Javier, I think your brother</i>
<i>is telling them more and more,</i>

06:00.880 --> 06:04.480
<i>but he's not saying everything,</i>
<i>and since they're comparing statements...</i>

06:04.560 --> 06:07.360
<i>And the kid? Have they got him yet?</i>

06:12.520 --> 06:15.080
The situation is becoming
more shocking and perplexing

06:15.160 --> 06:17.520
due to the number of young men
potentially involved

06:17.600 --> 06:19.600
in the murder of Marta del Castillo.

06:19.680 --> 06:23.120
One of them is a minor, who will
be sent to a juvenile detention center.

06:24.120 --> 06:30.160
<i>When the minor asked us</i>
<i>why we had moved him to Seville,</i>

06:30.240 --> 06:35.040
<i>we told him that we had found</i>
a <i>mix of genetic profiles,</i>

06:35.120 --> 06:37.240
<i>his with Marta's,</i>

06:37.320 --> 06:40.280
<i>and then he immediately burst into tears.</i>

06:40.360 --> 06:46.800
<i>He was inconsolable, crying,</i>
<i>but not in a normal way.</i>

06:46.880 --> 06:50.760
<i>He said that</i>
<i>he had seen Marta covered in blood.</i>

06:50.840 --> 06:55.080
<i>He said he went outside</i>
<i>to make a call from a payphone.</i>

07:01.600 --> 07:04.400
Francisco Javier García,
better known as "El Cuco,"

07:04.480 --> 07:08.480
was the youngest in the gang,
and his family was a bit strange.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.880
He basically came from a broken home.

07:10.960 --> 07:15.840
He was always with Miguel and Samuel,
trying to copy everything they did.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.680
He went everywhere by bike,

07:20.760 --> 07:23.640
and he also had
a very special relationship with Marta.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.920
I said, "Marta, who's that boy
who comes to pick you up from school?"

07:28.000 --> 07:31.520
"I think he must like you.
But he's just a kid."

07:31.600 --> 07:33.760
She said,
"Mom, he's really young, isn't he?"

07:34.280 --> 07:36.240
And then her friends told me

07:36.320 --> 07:39.880
that he had
a bit of a crush on my daughter.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.840

07:40.920 --> 07:43.920

07:54.160 --> 07:55.000
<i>Yes, that's me.</i>

07:55.080 --> 07:57.120
<i>I'm calling</i>
<i>from the Medina Azahara Center.</i>

07:57.200 --> 07:59.240
<i>I'd like to pass on a call from your son.</i>

07:59.320 --> 08:00.440
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

08:00.520 --> 08:01.480
<i>How's it going?</i>

08:02.000 --> 08:04.240
<i>How's it going?</i>
<i>I wasn't expecting you to call.</i>

08:04.320 --> 08:05.880
<i>-Mom.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

08:05.960 --> 08:06.960
<i>I was just thinking,</i>

08:07.040 --> 08:10.160
<i>didn't you say that you were going</i>
<i>to throw away all the knives?</i>

08:12.000 --> 08:16.040
<i>Javier, I don't think this is something</i>
<i>we should be talking about on the phone.</i>

08:16.120 --> 08:17.080
<i>No, no, listen--</i>

08:17.160 --> 08:18.240
<i>No, listen.</i>

08:18.320 --> 08:22.560
<i>I don't know if you know,</i>
<i>but they're listening on the phone.</i>

08:22.640 --> 08:23.600
<i>Who?</i>

08:23.680 --> 08:28.120
<i>Remember in the movies, they say,</i>
<i>"I've put a whatever-you-call it..."?</i>

08:29.280 --> 08:31.160
<i>I don't understand, Mom.</i>

08:32.200 --> 08:34.200
<i>-They tap the phones.</i>
<i>-Oh.</i>

08:34.280 --> 08:36.040
<i>-Do you get what I'm saying?</i>
<i>-What?</i>

08:36.120 --> 08:39.040
<i>Everything we say</i>
<i>is being recorded by the police.</i>

08:40.520 --> 08:43.160
<i>-Do you understand me now?</i>
<i>-Oh, okay, yeah.</i>

08:43.240 --> 08:46.720
<i>I didn't know. You should have</i>
<i>told me before, Mom. Come on...</i>

PHOTOGRAPH 2 FROM TUENTI:
FIVE KNIVES OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND TYPES

08:51.640 --> 08:53.920
THE SECOND FROM THE TOP
IS MOST SIMILAR TO...

08:56.680 --> 09:01.040
That kid had a strange obsession
with knives, blades,

09:01.120 --> 09:02.720
and everything like that.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.840
Very cocky, really sure of himself,

09:05.920 --> 09:08.200
but it seemed like it was a front.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.640
He wanted to be like his idols,
Miguel and Samuel.

09:17.840 --> 09:22.160

"EL CUCO'S" VERSION OF EVENTS

09:40.600 --> 09:41.600
I went in...

09:42.520 --> 09:44.040
Samuel came through here.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.120
Wait a second.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.040
-Yes, continue.
-Samuel came through here.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.200
Wait, Francisco Javier.
Francisco Javier, one moment, please.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.000
-Is this the bedroom?
-Yeah.

09:57.080 --> 10:01.320
There's a hole.
He also punched it. There's a hole.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.400
And behind, there's another
bigger one that Miguel did.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.160
We can verify those incidents now.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.360
Shall I remove this?

10:16.160 --> 10:17.680
Samuel was here.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.440
Then Miguel was there,
and I was here. I stayed here.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.200
-So, what did you see from here?
-Miguel and the body were there.

10:26.280 --> 10:30.240
I was looking there,
at what Miguel was doing.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.040
And I looked straight at Francisco Javier.
I looked him in the eyes.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.640
POLICE OFFICER

10:42.720 --> 10:45.800
<i>"El Cuco" showed us</i>

10:48.520 --> 10:51.800
<i>Miguel was there with Francisco Javier,</i>
<i>Miguel's brother.</i>

10:51.880 --> 10:57.720
<i>And he said to him,</i>
<i>"If you say anything about this,</i>

SURNAME: DELGADO MORENO
FIRST NAME: FRANCISCO JAVIER

11:09.880 --> 11:13.040
Murderer, son of a bitch!

11:17.200 --> 11:19.720
They arrested me there and then,

11:19.800 --> 11:22.400
without an explanation
of why they were arresting me.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.720
They put me in a room with eight officers.

11:25.800 --> 11:31.440
They kept saying over and over that,
since I'm the brother,

11:31.520 --> 11:35.480
if I've covered something up,
then I haven't committed a crime,

11:35.560 --> 11:37.400
but they wanted a quick confession.

11:38.160 --> 11:44.200
I'm convinced that if they put that same
kind of pressure on a 15-year-old kid,

11:44.280 --> 11:46.240
he would sing like a canary.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.800
I took it and left.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.640
And when I was over there...

11:52.680 --> 11:54.720
<i>Of the four suspects</i>
<i>arrested in this case,</i>

11:54.800 --> 11:58.240
<i>one has yet to tell</i>
<i>his version of events before the judge.</i>

11:58.320 --> 12:01.960
<i>He's being held at the police station and</i>
<i>is the brother of the alleged murderer.</i>

12:05.040 --> 12:08.680
FRANCISCO JAVIER'S VERSION OF EVENTS

12:08.760 --> 12:11.120
On January 24th, Miguel came home,

12:11.840 --> 12:14.800
and I asked him,
"What's up? Are you alone?"

12:14.880 --> 12:18.960
And he told me he was with someone.
And so, I left, so he can be alone.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.000
LEÓN XIII STREET
8:40 p.m.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.880
Then I went to the house
on Tharsis Street,

12:23.960 --> 12:27.520
and my ex-wife arrived shortly after.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.720
I was there until...

12:29.800 --> 12:33.920
It would've been around 11:30 at night

12:34.000 --> 12:36.320
when María picked me up

12:36.400 --> 12:38.560
to take me to the bar.

12:38.640 --> 12:42.080
I got to the bar at around 11:50 p.m.

12:42.160 --> 12:48.000
I took over for my colleague,
María left for León XIII Street,

12:48.080 --> 12:52.240
and I stayed at the bar
until around 3:00 in the morning.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.320
03:00
DSEDA BAR

12:53.400 --> 12:55.320
I closed up and took a taxi

12:55.400 --> 13:01.240
to a bar that I'd normally go to
after mine closed.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.320
I had a quick drink

13:03.400 --> 13:05.480
and then went
to the flat on León XIII Street.

13:05.560 --> 13:09.000
I got there at around 4:00.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.880
María let me in, and we went to bed.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.400
And that's it.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.720
Aside from El Cuco's statement,

13:20.800 --> 13:25.520
Javier Delgado was held in jail
because several calls were received,

13:25.600 --> 13:28.080
placing him in the flat
on León XIII Street,

13:28.160 --> 13:31.680
at a time when the police believed
that Marta was already dead.

13:31.760 --> 13:36.760
THIS MEANS THAT HIS BROTHER,
FRANCISCO JAVIER,

13:36.840 --> 13:40.440
WAS IN THE FLAT
WHEN THE EVENTS OCCURRED.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.080
<i>What's up, darling? How are you?</i>

13:49.160 --> 13:50.720
FRANCISCO JAVIER TO HIS GIRLFRIEND

13:50.800 --> 13:52.680
<i>Well, bad. How else would I be?</i>

13:52.760 --> 13:55.400
<i>I can't be good but, you know, I'm coping.</i>

13:55.480 --> 13:58.800
<i>Anyway, in any case,</i>
<i>they don't have anything on me.</i>

13:58.880 --> 14:03.880
<i>I called you at 8:40 p.m.</i>
<i>Shit, if they look at 8:40 p.m...</i>

14:03.960 --> 14:06.800
<i>Check the call at 9:05 p.m.</i>
<i>I'm at the house on Tharsis Street.</i>

14:06.880 --> 14:11.720
<i>Well, you know, it's always the same.</i>
<i>But it's normal, as well. I get it.</i>

14:11.800 --> 14:14.760
<i>With everything going on,</i>
<i>they're not just going to let me go.</i>

14:14.840 --> 14:15.680
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

14:15.760 --> 14:20.160
<i>It's all just come down on us</i>
<i>from nowhere, you know.</i>

14:20.720 --> 14:22.640
<i>It's all a mess and that's it.</i>

14:22.720 --> 14:25.760
<i>Take it easy. They'll let you go</i>
<i>in the end, you'll see. Okay?</i>

14:25.840 --> 14:28.120
<i>-I miss you so much.</i>
<i>-I love you, honey.</i>

14:28.200 --> 14:30.240
<i>I love you, darling. Take care, okay?</i>

14:30.320 --> 14:31.760
<i>Bye. Keep your chin up.</i>

14:31.840 --> 14:33.040
<i>Talk to you soon.</i>

14:37.840 --> 14:40.680
When I went to prison,
at first, I couldn't believe it.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.600
I said, there's something
here that... This isn't...

14:43.680 --> 14:45.520
Like, what am I doing here?

14:45.600 --> 14:49.480
You don't believe that this
could be happening to you, you know?

14:49.560 --> 14:53.520
Sorry, we're live right now,
at the press conference

14:53.600 --> 14:57.440
with Andalusia's government
representative, Juan José López Garzón.

14:57.520 --> 15:01.680
He's there with Enrique Àlvarez,
the Chief of Police in Seville.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.520
It's best that no one watches
that press conference again,

15:04.600 --> 15:07.320
because, if you were to watch it now,
in retrospect,

15:07.400 --> 15:11.200
it seems almost ridiculous, you know,
with everything that happened there.

15:11.280 --> 15:15.040
The police carried out an investigation

15:15.120 --> 15:17.760
as it needed to be carried out:

15:17.840 --> 15:21.160
discreetly, seriously, and efficiently.

15:22.040 --> 15:25.160
I'll now give the floor
to the Chief of Police,

15:25.240 --> 15:28.240
who will discuss the details
of the investigation.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.480
The information
that we're going to give you

15:30.560 --> 15:32.600
has been corroborated and is accurate.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.760
There are no hunches,
assumptions or intuitions.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.680
Suddenly, there was a press conference

15:37.760 --> 15:41.160
with all the heads of police
in official uniform.

15:41.240 --> 15:45.880
To me, this seemed
completely inappropriate and unhelpful,

15:45.960 --> 15:49.600
in terms of the effectiveness
of the investigation.

15:50.400 --> 15:55.160
On the 24th,
at around 5:00 in the evening,

15:56.520 --> 15:57.840
Miguel left his home,

15:57.920 --> 16:01.120
a home that he shared with his girlfriend,
in the town of Camas,

16:01.200 --> 16:02.600
and he headed to Seville.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.680
Actually, he fancied himself up,

16:04.760 --> 16:06.840
even putting in blue contact lenses,

16:06.920 --> 16:10.480
which he used to change
his eye color from time to time.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.760
There was an argument,
and in the course of the argument,

16:14.520 --> 16:18.640
in the spur of the moment,
he hit her on the head with an ashtray,

16:18.720 --> 16:20.920
and Marta collapsed to the ground.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.440
We have irrefutable
scientific evidence of this.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.800
Are you convinced,

16:24.880 --> 16:27.320
despite the statements of the accused,

16:27.400 --> 16:30.440
that Marta del Castillo
is in the Guadalquivir River?

16:30.520 --> 16:31.680
CHIEF OF POLICE SPEAKS

16:31.760 --> 16:35.160
We are 99% sure that she is there.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.440
The Chief of Police in Seville

16:37.520 --> 16:40.680
was very clear in his statement.

16:40.760 --> 16:45.080
He has refuted rumors
that the ashtray has been found,

16:45.160 --> 16:46.640
which hasn't been found...

16:46.720 --> 16:50.520
He also clearly stated
that Marta never went home.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.040
-Information...
-...that was given...

16:54.120 --> 16:57.920
...and that we were the first
to reveal on this show.

16:58.000 --> 16:58.960
Suddenly,

16:59.040 --> 17:02.640
the Chief of Police in Andalusia,
Enrique Àlvarez Riestra, appears, saying,

17:02.720 --> 17:06.800
"We've solved the case!
We have all the proof."

17:06.880 --> 17:08.360
I said, "Shit, it's solved."

17:10.520 --> 17:13.400
Three weeks feel like an eternity,
but three weeks...

17:13.480 --> 17:15.840
I'd like all cases
to be solved in three weeks.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.080
NEWS

17:20.160 --> 17:23.320
A drastic turn of events
in the Marta del Castillo investigation.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.240
Miguel Carcaño, suspected of killing
the girl from Seville,

17:26.320 --> 17:27.880
has retracted his confession

17:27.960 --> 17:31.280
and accused the minor, nicknamed
"El Cuco," of having murdered Marta.

17:31.360 --> 17:34.600
The authorities are trying to verify
if he lied before or is lying now,

17:34.680 --> 17:36.560
or whether he has lied on both occasions.

17:38.800 --> 17:43.800
MIGUEL'S THIRD VERSION
MARCH 17, 2009 - 5:00 p.m.

17:43.880 --> 17:47.320
The purpose of this is to reconstruct
the version of events

17:47.400 --> 17:49.560
that you provided in your last statement.
Okay?

17:49.640 --> 17:50.840
Okay.

17:50.920 --> 17:54.800
When I got here,
Marta was sitting on the bed,

17:54.880 --> 17:57.000
and Javi was in front of her,

17:57.080 --> 17:59.280
with the knife, more or less there.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.280
He started to take off her pants.

18:04.080 --> 18:08.680
She was telling him not to do anything,
that she wouldn't tell anyone,

18:08.760 --> 18:10.120
and to leave her alone.

18:10.200 --> 18:13.360
Then Javi slapped her here.

18:14.360 --> 18:20.000
Then he took...
He took off her underwear as well.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.680
Can you tell me
how that would be possible,

18:23.760 --> 18:27.120
how he could do that with one hand
if Marta was sitting down?

18:27.200 --> 18:31.200
How could Cuco take off
Marta's pants and underwear?

18:31.280 --> 18:33.160
What I saw was that he was here,

18:33.240 --> 18:37.560
and with his left hand,
he started to pull down her clothes.

18:37.640 --> 18:42.120
He threw her on the bed
and got on top of her.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.840
Okay. So, what did Cuco do then?

18:45.920 --> 18:46.840
What happened?

18:46.920 --> 18:50.120
He got down, grabbed Marta by her hair

18:50.200 --> 18:52.920
and put her on her knees, on the floor.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.360
With the knife in the same hand,
he took out the electrical tape.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.600
He told her to stay still
and to put her hands behind her.

19:03.840 --> 19:09.560
Then he bent over
and taped her hands together.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.200
And he took the extension cable

19:11.280 --> 19:14.360
and wrapped it a couple of times
round her neck.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.880
He took her and pushed her back,

19:17.960 --> 19:21.240
where she stayed,
and then he got on top of her.

19:21.320 --> 19:25.680
You could hear her trying to scream.

19:25.760 --> 19:31.520
Then she stopped screaming,
and I saw her leg was moving.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.960
Where were Marta's arms?

19:33.040 --> 19:37.080
This one was pointing that way,
and this one was around here,

19:37.160 --> 19:39.280
or a bit under the desk.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.840
Her arms were behind her back, I think.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.360
Ah, her arms were behind her.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.720
Why did you say
they were in that position?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.600
So, the arms weren't spread out.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.040
So, explain to me,

19:53.120 --> 19:57.200
how was the blood pressure monitor used,
the one you said was used?

20:02.560 --> 20:03.760
I went out...

20:06.960 --> 20:09.400
CUCO WENT TO THE BATHROOM
FOR A BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR

20:09.480 --> 20:11.240
THAT HIS ILL MOTHER HAD USED.

20:11.320 --> 20:12.920
CUCO TOOK IT TO THE BEDROOM,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.880
TOOK MARTA'S PULSE,
AND SAW SHE WAS DEAD.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.800
NATIONAL POLICE FORCE
FORENSIC DEPARTMENT

20:21.880 --> 20:24.560
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
OF BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR

20:24.640 --> 20:26.160
DNA OF MARTA AND MIGUEL

20:26.240 --> 20:29.920
So, you can't tell me how
the blood pressure monitor was put on?

20:30.000 --> 20:33.360
Yes, it was put on her left hand.

20:35.800 --> 20:40.360
But Marta had her hands
behind her back the whole time.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.000
In a decubitus supine position:
lying face up.

20:44.800 --> 20:45.760
Miguel...

20:47.720 --> 20:49.000
What's up with that?

20:49.080 --> 20:52.640
I'm not lying. I'm just nervous and...

20:52.720 --> 20:56.080
It's not that... I'm forgetting
some things. It's not that...

20:56.920 --> 20:58.200
I'm not lying to you.

20:59.120 --> 21:02.080
So, when the issue of the rape came up...

21:04.480 --> 21:08.080
the guy started coming out
with such horrific details that...

21:13.680 --> 21:15.160
I didn't want to picture it.

21:23.040 --> 21:23.960
Now, now!

21:35.560 --> 21:39.200
Miguel said one thing, then another.
Suddenly, there was a third version.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.880
It was a strangulation,
then suddenly it was a rape.

21:41.960 --> 21:46.000
I finished that reconstruction
at around 10 p.m., and we left.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.600
And as Miguel
was being returned to prison,

21:48.680 --> 21:50.880
he says he wants
to give another statement.

21:52.040 --> 21:56.480
MIGUEL'S FOURTH VERSION OF EVENTS
MARCH 17, 2009 - 11:00 p.m.

21:58.280 --> 22:02.680
Look me in the eyes, you son of a bitch!
Look me in the eyes!

22:02.760 --> 22:06.480
At first, he said
that it had been "El Cuco"

22:06.560 --> 22:09.680
who had sexually assaulted Marta
and killed her,

22:09.760 --> 22:12.760
and that he was
little more than a witness.

22:12.840 --> 22:16.880
But that night, Miguel also
implicated himself in the sexual assault.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.480
Bastard!

22:20.080 --> 22:22.040
First, he said it was "El Cuco."

22:23.160 --> 22:25.440
When he said it was both of them,

22:25.520 --> 22:29.120
then I said,
"My God, if it was both of them..."

22:30.880 --> 22:35.200
Murderer!

22:36.080 --> 22:38.680
That was a version...

22:38.760 --> 22:41.960
Well, I think
that he gave it for a reason,

22:42.040 --> 22:45.120
to not have to face a public jury

22:45.200 --> 22:47.760
that he already knew
was going to be against him,

22:47.840 --> 22:50.320
because the public
were more than against him.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.280
He was one of the most hated people
in Spain at the time.

22:54.920 --> 22:57.320
A MURDERER LIVES HERE

22:57.400 --> 23:00.680
Miguel Carcaño
has claimed there was a sexual assault.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.200
I don't know if you know,

23:02.280 --> 23:06.080
but public juries in Spain
are not used for sexual offenses.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.720
It has been decided,
the court has decided,

23:08.800 --> 23:12.560
that Marta's death was a result
of a sexual offence, perpetrated or not,

23:12.640 --> 23:14.200
because it hasn't been proven,

23:14.280 --> 23:18.280
and that has freed all defendants
from a jury trial.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.360
The craziest thing

23:20.440 --> 23:24.800
is that this version of Marta's murder,
as unbelievable as it is,

23:25.440 --> 23:29.040
is the only realistic version
in terms of getting rid of the body.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.360
How did you get the body out of the house?

23:33.440 --> 23:35.400
I brought the bags.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.280
I brought the bags.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.600
I took out two.

23:49.080 --> 23:52.600
<i>A dramatic turn of events in the search</i>
<i>for Marta del Castillo's body.</i>

23:52.680 --> 23:54.880
<i>The young girl's confessed murderer</i>

23:54.960 --> 23:57.960
<i>now says that they disposed</i>
<i>of the body in a dumpster</i>

23:58.040 --> 24:01.880
<i>barely a hundred meters from the flat</i>
<i>where she was supposedly murdered,</i>

24:01.960 --> 24:04.280
<i>and that they did not</i>
<i>throw her in the river.</i>

24:05.280 --> 24:07.040
How did you get Marta in the chair?

24:07.120 --> 24:09.640
Samuel and I did it,

24:09.720 --> 24:13.760
and Javi was back here, holding the chair.

24:15.480 --> 24:16.440
WITNESS

24:16.520 --> 24:20.600
<i>I went to toss the trash in the dumpsters</i>
<i>outside to the left of the bar.</i>

24:20.680 --> 24:25.680
<i>I noticed two people pushing a wheelchair</i>

24:26.440 --> 24:32.080
<i>with a large object on it,</i>
<i>and I thought it was carpet or a rug.</i>

24:32.160 --> 24:38.000
<i>And I thought, "How strange for someone</i>
<i>to take out the trash at this time."</i>

24:38.600 --> 24:40.840
<i>It was at around 2:00 a.m.,</i>
<i>or five minutes to, </i>

24:40.920 --> 24:43.280
<i>because during that time,</i>

24:43.960 --> 24:46.680
<i>the show </i>Se llama Copla
<i>on Canal Sur,</i>

24:46.760 --> 24:49.040
<i>would do the challenge,</i>

24:49.120 --> 24:54.320
<i>which is when I'd go take out the trash,</i>
<i>while my wife watched the end of the show.</i>

25:03.240 --> 25:06.600
<i>So, now we're going to see</i>
<i>who is the winner tonight.</i>

25:06.680 --> 25:11.280
<i>The jury and the audience</i>
<i>have decided that tonight's winner is...</i>

25:11.360 --> 25:14.800
THE SEARCH FOR MARTA MOVES
FROM THE RIVER TO SEVILLE'S LANDFILL

25:14.880 --> 25:17.760
MINISTER OF INTERIOR:
SEARCH WILL USE "ALL MEANS NECESSARY"

25:17.840 --> 25:20.920
Moving on
from the financial crisis to Seville.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.440
The police have already begun searching
the landfill to find Marta's body.

25:25.520 --> 25:29.520
<i>That's right,</i> <i>Marta's body may be buried</i>
<i>under 40,000 tons of garbage...</i>

25:29.600 --> 25:31.720
<i>They need to search one bag at a time.</i>

25:31.800 --> 25:34.920
<i>All garbage has been cordoned off</i>
<i>and is being guarded by the police.</i>

25:35.600 --> 25:37.160
<i>What everyone is wondering is,</i>

25:37.240 --> 25:39.440
<i>could Marta's body</i>
<i>really be at the landfill?</i>

25:39.520 --> 25:42.520
<i>It could. The day Marta disappeared,</i>
<i>it was raining heavily.</i>

25:42.600 --> 25:45.200
<i>So, she didn't pass through</i>
<i>the filter, through the chute,</i>

25:45.280 --> 25:48.440
<i>where it was previously believed</i>
<i>that Marta's body had passed through.</i>

25:51.600 --> 25:56.040
I thought, "They threw my daughter away
like a piece of trash,

25:57.520 --> 26:00.600
like a piece of garbage in a trash can."

26:00.680 --> 26:02.680
You wouldn't even do that to an animal.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.880
MARTA'S EX-BOYFRIEND ADMITS HE RAPED HER
AND THREW HER INTO A DUMPSTER

26:07.960 --> 26:09.120
MARTA'S EX-BOYFRIEND...

26:09.200 --> 26:11.720
THE EX-BOYFRIEND...

26:11.800 --> 26:12.680
EX-BOYFRIEND

26:17.200 --> 26:19.800
First and foremost,
I'm going to appeal to you...

26:21.320 --> 26:23.200
I'd like to ask you a favor, please.

26:23.800 --> 26:27.600
We have seen the word
"ex-boyfriend" in the headlines.

26:27.680 --> 26:28.840
I ask you, please...

26:30.120 --> 26:33.200
Stop using that word,

26:33.280 --> 26:35.800
in both your articles and your headlines,

26:36.320 --> 26:39.880
because a one-month relationship
between my niece and that murderer

26:40.520 --> 26:42.720
doesn't even deserve
the term "ex-boyfriend."

26:45.800 --> 26:48.480
For now, this is classified as a homicide,

26:48.560 --> 26:54.320
but obviously, we could also even be
talking about a crime of domestic abuse.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.480
Well, I don't quite agree with that.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.920
I've spoken with prosecutors
for domestic violence,

27:00.000 --> 27:03.080
and they're not sure
that this is a case of domestic violence,

27:03.160 --> 27:04.720
although some claim that it is.

27:04.800 --> 27:05.760
That's the problem,

27:05.840 --> 27:08.440
and that's why I have
to disagree with you, Javier,

27:08.520 --> 27:10.840
and consider it a case
of domestic violence

27:10.920 --> 27:13.680
because it's the death of a woman
at the hands of a man,

27:13.760 --> 27:15.640
as a result of a relationship.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.000
If we want justice to be done,

27:18.080 --> 27:21.000
we have to start calling it
by the right name,

27:21.080 --> 27:23.320
and it's clearly
a case of gender violence,

27:23.400 --> 27:27.120
because he has murdered his ex-partner.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.720
At that time, it was deemed

27:31.800 --> 27:35.240
that this type of romantic relationship
that had existed

27:35.320 --> 27:40.120
between the main accused
and the victim, Marta,

27:40.200 --> 27:44.400
wasn't serious enough for the crime
to be considered gender violence.

27:46.200 --> 27:50.640
It's clear that within our society,
we still need to make a lot of progress,

27:50.720 --> 27:54.200
because the situation
and the image of women

27:54.280 --> 27:57.360
continue to be viewed with disrespect,

27:57.440 --> 28:01.600
vulnerability and submission
in relation to men.

28:01.680 --> 28:06.760
That is why we still see attitudes
that justify violence against women

28:06.840 --> 28:11.040
and, even worse, place the blame
on the women who suffer this violence.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.160
I would hear comments like,

28:15.240 --> 28:19.600
"What was she looking for in that house?
Why did she go there alone?"

28:20.480 --> 28:21.920
It was her friend's house.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.960
"Look at how she was dressed
or how she was behaving..."

28:25.040 --> 28:27.080
What difference does it make how I dress?

28:27.160 --> 28:28.920
What happened is this:

28:29.000 --> 28:34.240
three guys, kids, men,

28:35.640 --> 28:37.000
killed a young girl.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.400
That hurt us.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.880
It's hurtful that people
could have imagined Marta

28:46.200 --> 28:47.960
as some wild teenager,

28:48.040 --> 28:51.160
a teenager that...
She wasn't like that.

28:54.480 --> 28:57.120
<i>-Hey, what's up?</i>
<i>-Hey, big man.</i>

29:04.920 --> 29:06.880
<i>Today was a crucial day in the search</i>

29:06.960 --> 29:10.320
<i>for the body of Marta del Castillo</i>
<i>in this landfill.</i>

29:10.400 --> 29:12.360
<i>It was expected</i>
<i>to either find the body</i>

29:12.440 --> 29:14.840
<i>or to rule out</i>
<i>that she was there,</i>

29:14.920 --> 29:17.040
<i>but the rain has made that impossible.</i>

29:21.440 --> 29:24.720
They're screwing around
with the justice system, with us,

29:25.240 --> 29:29.120
with the entire population,
because this makes absolutely no sense.

29:29.200 --> 29:33.040
I don't know how hard it is
to get a confession

29:34.000 --> 29:36.240
from these kinds of people or...

29:37.280 --> 29:39.760
Today, they say one thing.
Tomorrow, something else.

29:39.840 --> 29:43.560
And there's nothing written
in the law about this, you know?

29:43.640 --> 29:46.280
Antonio, did you know
that this very morning,

29:46.360 --> 29:48.880
-the police went to León XIII Street?
-Yes.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.560
And it looks like
they've found something in the drain.

29:51.640 --> 29:52.880
Did you know?

29:52.960 --> 29:56.560
No, this is the first I've heard of it.
What did they find in the drain?

30:11.840 --> 30:13.840
POLICE

30:20.880 --> 30:23.040
CHIEF OF THE JUVENILE POLICE UNIT (GRUME)

30:23.120 --> 30:27.200
<i>The forensic police unit and members</i>
<i>of the underground search unit</i>

30:27.280 --> 30:33.680
<i>were ordered to inspect the drains</i>
<i>near number 78 León XIII Street.</i>

30:33.760 --> 30:37.120
<i>And in this drain,</i>
<i>they found a butterfly knife.</i>

30:47.960 --> 30:51.800
<i>We found that "El Cuco,"</i>
<i>I mean, Francisco Javier García Marín,</i>

30:51.880 --> 30:55.280
<i>had posted his knife collection</i>
<i>on the social network Tuenti.</i>

30:55.360 --> 30:59.480
<i>And this collection included a knife</i>
<i>that was the same as the one we found.</i>

31:00.280 --> 31:01.480
MY PHOTOS

31:03.440 --> 31:05.680
SAMPLE 81: BUTTERFLY KNIFE

31:07.480 --> 31:10.520
When they said that "El Cuco"
threatened her with a knife

31:10.600 --> 31:12.240
and then they found the knife...

31:14.160 --> 31:17.840
everything just became too much for me,

31:17.920 --> 31:21.000
because I no longer had the relief

31:21.080 --> 31:23.720
of knowing that
it was just one blow and nothing else.

31:27.520 --> 31:30.400
With all the different versions
that Carcaño kept telling,

31:30.480 --> 31:34.280
as soon as he gave a new version
involving sexual assault,

31:34.360 --> 31:36.520
the lawyer that he'd had
up until that point

31:36.600 --> 31:39.160
decided that he'd had enough and quit.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.960
<i>After his lawyer stepped down,</i>

31:42.040 --> 31:45.080
<i>a second lawyer</i>
<i>has also declined to defend him.</i>

31:45.160 --> 31:49.520
<i>The Bar Association has yet to find</i>
<i>someone to defend the young man.</i>

31:50.480 --> 31:53.600
Finding a lawyer to defend

31:53.680 --> 31:57.640
someone who is so despised by the public

31:57.720 --> 31:59.360
is difficult.

32:01.080 --> 32:04.960
I took on the case
through the public defender's office.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.240
My mother said to me,

32:07.320 --> 32:10.920
"How can you defend that man?
Don't you feel sorry for Marta's parents?"

32:11.560 --> 32:15.560
I worked with Paloma, and when she said,

32:15.640 --> 32:17.440
"We're defending Miguel Carcaño..."

32:19.120 --> 32:21.800
Well... "Paloma,
we have our work cut out for us."

32:24.240 --> 32:26.120
<i>-Hello, my darling!</i>
<i>-How are you doing?</i>

32:26.200 --> 32:27.560
<i>How are you, my love?</i>

32:27.640 --> 32:29.720
<i>Good. I just got back from the yard.</i>

32:29.800 --> 32:32.200
<i>Are those journalists</i>
<i>still being a pain in the ass?</i>

32:32.280 --> 32:33.640
<i>No. They've stopped now.</i>

32:33.720 --> 32:35.320
<i>-You know what I think?</i>
<i>-What?</i>

32:35.400 --> 32:38.080
<i>That he killed her with the ashtray,</i>
<i>like he said at first,</i>

32:38.160 --> 32:40.960
<i>but instead of the river,</i>
<i>he threw her in the garbage.</i>

32:41.040 --> 32:43.880
<i>And he's trying to pin it</i>
<i>on everyone else.</i>

32:43.960 --> 32:47.240
<i>Isn't he ashamed that</i>
<i>he's landing everyone else in the shit?</i>

32:47.320 --> 32:50.160
<i>But he's covering for his brother</i>
<i>or someone, you know?</i>

32:50.240 --> 32:51.520
<i>He's a son of a bitch.</i>

32:54.120 --> 32:58.040
<i>We keep going round and round in circles</i>
<i>with all of Miguel's various lies.</i>

32:58.120 --> 33:00.160
<i>He's Marta del Castillo's alleged killer.</i>

33:00.240 --> 33:03.480
<i>What's the reason behind</i>
<i>all the different contradictory stories?</i>

33:03.560 --> 33:04.640
<i>It doesn't make sense,</i>

33:04.720 --> 33:08.720
<i>unless he's doing it</i>
<i>just to drive the police crazy.</i>

33:10.920 --> 33:14.800
Could you say that Miguel was a liar?

33:14.880 --> 33:18.600
Yeah, it's true that he could mislead you,

33:19.160 --> 33:23.920
and he could tell the odd lie,
like any other teenager,

33:24.000 --> 33:25.720
at least up until a certain point.

33:26.360 --> 33:27.560
Miguel?

33:27.640 --> 33:29.560
He's a compulsive liar.

33:29.640 --> 33:33.000
By making people feel sorry for him,
he achieved everything he wanted.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.680
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

33:34.760 --> 33:37.600
He said that his mother died
in a car accident

33:37.680 --> 33:39.600
with his stepfather and half-sister.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.200
It was all a lie.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.760
I know that his mother
sold lottery tickets,

33:44.840 --> 33:46.320
that she was in a wheelchair.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.240
As far as I know,
his mother died from an illness.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.800
He couldn't accept...

33:50.880 --> 33:52.080
MARTA'S FRIEND

33:52.160 --> 33:53.640
...any kind of criticism.

33:53.720 --> 33:56.040
And his way of dealing with it

33:56.120 --> 33:57.560
was being destructive.

33:57.640 --> 34:01.200
I've literally seen him
punch fire extinguishers.

34:01.280 --> 34:04.360
I know that he caused a lot of damage
at his brother's place.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.520
But he was a person that,

34:06.600 --> 34:08.640
despite all the bad things about him,

34:08.720 --> 34:13.160
we still found it really hard to believe
was capable of doing what he did.

34:14.160 --> 34:15.440
She was like this, and...

34:15.520 --> 34:17.880
Miguel is showing who he really is.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.320
He's a compulsive liar,

34:19.400 --> 34:22.400
and he'll say one thing today
and another tomorrow.

34:22.480 --> 34:28.960
I've also wondered if maybe this guy
doesn't even know where the body is,

34:29.040 --> 34:33.760
that he got someone else to deal with it,

34:33.840 --> 34:36.360
to move it or get rid of it,

34:36.440 --> 34:38.040
someone that he trusts,

34:38.120 --> 34:41.240
and now he's misleading
the police investigation

34:41.320 --> 34:43.480
to avoid giving the name
of this individual.

34:43.560 --> 34:46.320
POLICE

34:46.400 --> 34:51.120
Sources in the judicial sphere
have just given us some new information,

34:51.200 --> 34:53.440
which Ana Rosa Quintana
will provide details on.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.240
Nacho Abad's sources have once again

34:56.320 --> 35:00.040
shown themselves to be very well informed.

35:00.120 --> 35:01.440
Revealing details today

35:01.520 --> 35:04.800
from Marta del Castillo's case
that were previously unknown, until now.

35:04.880 --> 35:08.640
We're going to give you
their exclusive version of events.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.680
We have more exclusive images

35:10.760 --> 35:13.080
and some documents
that have never been seen before.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.400
UNEDITED INFORMATION

35:14.480 --> 35:15.960
EXCLUSIVE STATEMENTS

35:18.360 --> 35:23.160
Unfortunately, leaks are something
that we have to deal with constantly,

35:23.240 --> 35:27.280
as society demands information.

35:27.360 --> 35:31.240
JUDGE ON MARTA DEL CASTILLO CASE
ORDERS INVESTIGATION INTO MEDIA LEAKS

35:31.320 --> 35:34.400
JUDGE CALLS FIVE JOURNALISTS
TO TESTIFY ABOUT LEAKS IN CASE

35:34.480 --> 35:36.800
PRESS ASSOCIATION:
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE FOR JOURNALISTS

35:36.880 --> 35:39.160
TO BE CALLED TO TESTIFY
ON LEAKS IN MARTA'S CASE

35:39.240 --> 35:43.160
There were a lot of media outlets
providing information,

35:43.240 --> 35:48.160
lots of journalists calling their sources,
a lot of sources, and lots of information,

35:48.240 --> 35:52.280
so this led to a lot of leaks.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.240
Some of them were self-serving,

35:54.320 --> 35:55.840
and others were inaccurate

35:55.920 --> 35:57.200
or completely false,

35:57.880 --> 35:59.240
and some were actually true.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.480
FRIEND CONFESSES TO KILLING MARTA

36:01.560 --> 36:04.560
CASE GROWS MORE COMPLICATED
AS SUSPECTS' CALL LOGS ARE REVEALED

36:04.640 --> 36:09.400
Perhaps the most important foundation
for the argument of our case

36:09.480 --> 36:11.520
was the statements from people,

36:11.600 --> 36:15.760
and the leaks could obviously
influence or change these statements,

36:15.840 --> 36:20.320
so there was a game of minute details
where I'm sure they were analyzing them

36:20.400 --> 36:22.880
to end up with a story
of what happened that day.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.920
You can hamper the police investigation

36:25.000 --> 36:27.480
by warning third parties
about what's happening.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.120
There's no culture of respect

36:30.200 --> 36:33.120
for an investigation
that is still open and developing.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.480
THE POLICE PUT "PRESSURE" ON JOURNALISTS

36:35.560 --> 36:39.800
TO REVEAL THEIR SOURCES
IN THE MARTA DEL CASTILLO CASE.

36:43.880 --> 36:48.160
What we ask now, because we no longer
think we'll get our daughter back,

36:48.240 --> 36:49.920
is for a public referendum,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.840
because if the people of this country
want a life sentence,

36:52.920 --> 36:55.000
it would be democratic to ask them, right?

36:55.720 --> 36:57.480
And then, what I ask for is justice,

36:57.560 --> 37:00.640
that they apply
the maximum sentence possible.

37:01.400 --> 37:06.400
We'd like to ask Mr. Rajoy from
the opposition, and the Prime Minister,

37:06.480 --> 37:08.400
to find time in their schedules for us,

37:08.480 --> 37:11.800
so we can speak with them
over the coming week.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.520
Politicians were also getting involved,

37:18.600 --> 37:22.160
but they won't do anything either,
unless you push them.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.840
I've told the Prime Minister
and the Minister

37:25.920 --> 37:29.520
that the people
want the words "life sentence"

37:29.600 --> 37:32.080
written in the criminal code.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.760
It's a chain. All of it is a chain.

37:34.840 --> 37:39.360
Unless you move one domino piece
and it falls, the next one won't fall.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.640
Okay. Careful.

37:40.720 --> 37:43.840
VISIT WITH THE LEADER
OF THE OPPOSITION, SEVILLE

37:43.920 --> 37:49.240
This family, with the support behind them,
made the authorities take action,

37:49.320 --> 37:51.480
even the government ministers,

37:51.560 --> 37:53.960
and they gained their express support.

37:54.040 --> 37:59.000
What a contrast from those initial hours
where not even one police officer

37:59.080 --> 38:01.000
went out to search for Marta, right?

38:01.720 --> 38:03.640
Rajoy! Life sentence.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.720
JUSTICE FOR MARTA

38:04.800 --> 38:06.640
We have to ask for a life sentence.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.760
Life sentence!

38:09.840 --> 38:11.400
LIFE SENTENCE FOR THE MURDERS

38:12.200 --> 38:14.080
I want to ask the politicians

38:14.160 --> 38:17.440
to please listen to what
the people want from time to time.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.120
So, now we're getting somewhere.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.400
CONGRESS OF DEPUTIES

38:21.480 --> 38:26.120
All those signatures, I entered into
the Congress of Deputies' record

38:26.200 --> 38:28.720
to make them debate the issue.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.680
Your Honors, as you well know,

38:31.760 --> 38:35.560
applying a life sentence in our country

38:35.640 --> 38:39.920
is difficult to reconcile
with the terms of the constitution.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.200
You said yourself
on the radio this morning

38:42.280 --> 38:45.560
that asking this question
is playing politics

38:45.640 --> 38:48.920
with the victims' feelings
and with people's hearts.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.600
Your Honors, silence, please.

38:50.680 --> 38:53.400
You need to implement
a special protection plan,

38:53.480 --> 38:56.800
so that the relevant
legal amendments can be made

38:56.880 --> 38:59.280
to increase the sentences,
to make an example,

38:59.360 --> 39:02.360
of those accused of crimes against women

39:02.440 --> 39:05.720
and for the sentences
to be served in full.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.600
Do your part, Minister.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.040
Thank you...

39:09.120 --> 39:12.520
Politicians were
also impacted by the case.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.000
They were swept along
by the mobilization of society,

39:15.080 --> 39:19.720
partly due to the political opportunity

39:19.800 --> 39:24.480
of getting close to and showing support
for Marta del Castillo's parents.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.000
It's normal for parents
to ask for a life sentence.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.720
What's not normal is for a state...

39:28.800 --> 39:30.760
JUVENILE JUDGE FROM GRANADA

39:30.840 --> 39:34.120
...to amend laws due to an emotional plea.

39:34.200 --> 39:37.640
Life sentence!

39:37.720 --> 39:38.960
MURDERERS
LIFE SENTENCE

39:39.040 --> 39:40.840
In cases like these,

39:40.920 --> 39:45.600
there can be a desire
for more severe sentences to be served,

39:45.680 --> 39:48.920
in a way that perhaps
doesn't involve enough reflection.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.280
JAN. 21, 2015

39:52.280 --> 39:56.680
REVISABLE, PERMANENT IMPRISONMENT
HAS BEEN APPROVED TODAY IN CONGRESS.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.120
THANK YOU TO EVERYONE

39:59.200 --> 40:03.920
WHO HAS HELPED TO ACHIEVE THIS
WITH THEIR SIGNATURES.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.320
<i>More surprising news</i>
<i>in the last few hours:</i>

40:08.400 --> 40:12.040
<i>Marta del Castillo's accused killer,</i>
<i>Miguel Carcaño,</i>

40:12.120 --> 40:15.240
<i>has attempted to commit suicide</i>
<i>by hanging himself.</i>

40:15.320 --> 40:18.000
"IF THEY HAD TAKEN
EVEN A FEW SECONDS LONGER

40:18.080 --> 40:20.200
TO REALIZE WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

40:20.280 --> 40:22.600
CARCAÑO WOULD CERTAINLY BE DEAD"

40:22.680 --> 40:26.120
Just think how sorry I would be
if he had killed himself...

40:27.400 --> 40:29.480
My daughter still hadn't been found.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.240
I'm not going to lie,
if he had killed himself...

40:36.640 --> 40:39.640
it's horrible to say,
very horrible to say,

40:39.720 --> 40:40.920
but I wouldn't have cared.

40:45.960 --> 40:51.040
HOLY WEEK 2009

41:03.600 --> 41:08.320
Marta del Castillo, Seville is with you!

41:12.760 --> 41:15.320
<i>The Ministry of Interior</i>
<i>has confirmed today</i>

41:15.400 --> 41:17.800
<i>that, as of June,</i>
<i>the search for missing minors</i>

41:17.880 --> 41:20.520
<i>will begin from the very moment</i>
<i>they are reported missing.</i>

41:21.640 --> 41:26.080
I'm very happy about that change, because
although it won't help my daughter,

41:26.160 --> 41:28.320
it will help someone else in the future.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.600
Marta del Castillo, Seville is with you!

41:39.160 --> 41:41.320
DEFICIENT LAWS
NON-EXISTENT JUSTICE

41:41.400 --> 41:43.120
We're in pieces. As a family,

41:43.200 --> 41:46.280
we just want to have her with us
and for this nightmare to end.

41:47.480 --> 41:50.200
The only thing I ask
is that you don't forget my Marta.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.840
It's not just
that they murdered my daughter,

41:54.920 --> 41:57.320
but they are now
living comfortably in prison

41:57.400 --> 41:59.800
and if they don't want to say
where my daughter is,

41:59.880 --> 42:01.440
we'll keep doing this forever.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.120
WE ARE ALL MARTA

42:03.200 --> 42:05.680
A bit more.

42:06.520 --> 42:09.800
A bit more. Come on!

42:19.080 --> 42:21.960
APRIL 14, 2009

42:23.760 --> 42:24.720
<i>Three months</i>

42:24.800 --> 42:28.320
<i>after the death or disappearance</i>
<i>of Marta del Castillo,</i>

42:28.400 --> 42:32.520
<i>the judge who presided over the case</i>
<i>has ordered the arrest of this woman.</i>

42:33.200 --> 42:36.880
<i>She is Miguel Carcaño's</i>

HOMICIDE POLICE OFFICER

<i>García Mendaro claims</i>
<i>she was at the house the whole night.</i>

42:44.800 --> 42:47.960
<i>We have doubts about the truth</i>
<i>of García Mendaro's statements,</i>

42:48.040 --> 42:51.040
<i>because she says</i>
<i>she was at home from 11:30 p.m.,</i>

42:51.120 --> 42:55.080
<i>that no one came in, no one arrived,</i>
<i>and no one knocked on the shutters.</i>

42:57.240 --> 42:58.680
María García Mendaro...

42:58.760 --> 43:01.080
There are many contradictions
in her statement.

43:01.160 --> 43:04.640
She says that she was at home
when Antonio went there and knocked.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.840
No one answered and the lights were off.

43:10.200 --> 43:13.080
It's impossible
that she knew nothing about it.

43:13.160 --> 43:15.320

43:26.240 --> 43:27.280
<i>You look drained.</i>

43:27.360 --> 43:29.000
<i>And you? How are you doing?</i>

43:29.080 --> 43:30.400
<i>It's hard.</i>

43:31.120 --> 43:32.200
<i>But, you know...</i>

43:32.720 --> 43:35.440
<i>As long as you're okay</i>
<i>and you get out soon...</i>

43:36.240 --> 43:41.480
<i>I think I've now got authorization</i>
<i>to see people without a glass barrier.</i>

43:41.560 --> 43:43.680
<i>Does the "other one" come as well?</i>

43:43.760 --> 43:44.800
<i>No...</i>

43:44.880 --> 43:46.360
<i>Why is she lying?</i>

43:47.240 --> 43:48.400
<i>Lying about what?</i>

43:48.480 --> 43:50.720
<i>Why did she say</i>
<i>she was there at 1:30 a.m.?</i>

43:50.800 --> 43:52.040
<i>She was there.</i>

43:52.560 --> 43:54.560
<i>Well, then, why didn't she open the door?</i>

43:55.080 --> 43:56.000
<i>What door?</i>

43:56.080 --> 43:58.520
<i>When they came over.</i>
<i>Why didn't she open the door?</i>

43:58.600 --> 44:00.640
<i>-When who came over?</i>
<i>-The family.</i>

44:01.920 --> 44:03.920
<i>Don't trust everything you hear.</i>

44:04.440 --> 44:06.600
<i>But that's why</i>
<i>you could be in here for longer.</i>

44:06.680 --> 44:10.880
<i>Right now, your main problem</i>
<i>is that your friend was there at 1:30 a.m.</i>

44:11.520 --> 44:16.440
AT AROUND 1:30 a.m.,
ON THE DAY MIGUEL CARCAÑO WAS SEEN

44:16.520 --> 44:20.040
IN THE HALLWAY OF THE BUILDING
AT NO. 78 LEÓN XIII STREET

44:20.120 --> 44:21.800
WITH THE WHEELCHAIR...

44:21.880 --> 44:23.720
THIS INFORMATION ENABLES US TO ASSUME

44:23.800 --> 44:26.680
THAT, AT THE TIME MARÍA GARCÍA MENDARO
SAID SHE WAS AT HOME,

44:26.760 --> 44:29.360
THE VICTIM'S BODY
WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN INSIDE,

44:29.440 --> 44:32.800
IMPLICATING HER IN THE DEATH
AND DISAPPEARANCE OF THE TEENAGER.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.960
It all clicked when they arrested
María García Mendaro.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.720
They should have put her in prison
right there and then.

44:41.800 --> 44:43.960
CRIME OF DISAPPEARANCE

44:46.120 --> 44:49.200
THE PROVISIONAL RELEASE
OF MARÍA GARCÍA MENDARO IS AGREED

44:50.600 --> 44:53.400
APRIL 14, 2009

44:54.560 --> 45:00.080
I think that what
should have been done was not done.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.960
I reproached my lawyer for that.

45:04.040 --> 45:09.160
I said, "How is it possible that
all the others have gone to prison,

45:09.240 --> 45:11.440
but María García is still out there,

45:12.400 --> 45:14.160
while accused of the same crime?"

45:14.240 --> 45:16.200
REASON FOR ARREST:
MURDER, CONCEALMENT

45:16.280 --> 45:21.560
Truth be told, I couldn't see any reason

45:22.360 --> 45:24.200
for-- Well...

45:24.280 --> 45:27.200
To start with, keeping someone in custody

45:27.280 --> 45:30.320
prevents them
from tampering with evidence,

45:30.400 --> 45:36.200
prevents them
from attacking the victim again

45:36.280 --> 45:41.560
or, the most common reason, to stop them
from leaving if they're a flight risk.

45:42.200 --> 45:46.360
As far as I know, none
of these circumstances applied to María.

45:48.480 --> 45:51.280
That makes you think.

45:52.160 --> 45:55.520
Not because she's any worse
or better than the others,

45:55.600 --> 45:57.160
but because of who she was.

45:57.240 --> 46:02.600
Because she was the daughter of
an important politician here in Andalusia.

46:04.360 --> 46:10.240
I honestly never gave much credence
to all those conspiracies

46:11.720 --> 46:14.760
about outside influences,
legal influences...

46:14.840 --> 46:18.680
To be honest, it just seemed
as if they had no grounds to detain her.

46:19.960 --> 46:22.120
<i>Surprising news</i>
<i>from the courts in Seville:</i>

46:22.200 --> 46:25.680
<i>Marta del Castillo's</i>
<i>accused killer's brother</i>

46:25.760 --> 46:29.440
<i>has been released</i>
<i>after the investigating judge</i>

46:29.520 --> 46:31.840
<i>found that he played</i>
<i>a lesser role in the events</i>

46:31.920 --> 46:33.720
<i>than the other three accused in prison.</i>

46:33.800 --> 46:35.640
<i>This is a contradiction by the judge,</i>

46:35.720 --> 46:38.120
<i>who jailed him</i>
<i>for being the ringleader of the group,</i>

46:38.200 --> 46:39.840
<i>but has now released him</i>

46:39.920 --> 46:43.520
<i>because his involvement was limited and</i>
<i>he didn't play a main role in the crime.</i>

46:43.600 --> 46:46.280
<i>The family</i>
<i>does not understand the decision.</i>

46:46.360 --> 46:47.960
This doesn't make any sense.

46:48.040 --> 46:52.120
How was he guilty three months ago
and today he's practically innocent?

46:52.200 --> 46:53.760
Before we realize it,

46:53.840 --> 46:56.000
all the blame will be placed on Marta,

46:56.520 --> 46:58.640
and she'll be the one accused of things.

46:58.720 --> 47:04.040
When I got out of prison,
I realized the scale of the case.

47:04.120 --> 47:08.840
During those 90 days,
there was no one who could speak for me.

47:09.800 --> 47:11.040
I didn't kill Kennedy

47:11.120 --> 47:15.640
because I wasn't in Dallas
the year he was killed.

47:16.240 --> 47:20.760
They even said that I wasn't talking
because I was protecting some drug dealer.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.320
Outrageous things.

47:22.400 --> 47:26.080
And worst of all, because it's said on TV,

47:26.160 --> 47:29.080
people think everything
that's said on TV is true.

47:30.360 --> 47:34.000
CLEVER MICE

47:34.080 --> 47:35.640
Do you think there's a ringleader?

47:35.720 --> 47:36.960
MARTA'S FATHER

47:37.040 --> 47:38.800
A ringleader? Yes.

47:38.880 --> 47:41.000
Someone making the decisions? Yes.

47:41.520 --> 47:46.120
And I think it's Javier,
the older brother.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.480
This is an unusual interview,

47:50.280 --> 47:52.040
where the interviewee

47:52.120 --> 47:55.440
has expressly asked to appear disguised

47:56.120 --> 47:58.480
and for his voice to be distorted,

47:58.560 --> 48:00.480
so that he's not recognized,

48:00.560 --> 48:04.000
because he fears
being lynched by the public.

48:05.280 --> 48:07.280
He is Francisco Javier Delgado,

48:08.680 --> 48:10.680
Miguel Carcaño's half-brother.

48:10.760 --> 48:13.680
Miguel is Marta del Castillo's
confessed killer.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.480
Do you claim to be innocent?

48:16.560 --> 48:19.040
Always, and that will never change.

48:19.120 --> 48:22.760
There is no evidence
to show that I have committed a crime.

48:22.840 --> 48:28.720
I had nothing to do with the murder,
nor with the disappearance of the body,

48:29.240 --> 48:32.320
nor in covering anything up,
in any way, at all.

48:32.400 --> 48:35.440
I'd do anything
to prove that I'm telling the truth.

48:35.520 --> 48:39.240
If a so-called truth serum really existed,

48:39.320 --> 48:41.640
I'd have no problem taking it.

48:41.720 --> 48:46.520
If hypnosis could be used,
I'd have no problem with that.

48:46.600 --> 48:48.400
I'm only interested in the truth.

48:48.480 --> 48:51.560
If you knew the whole truth,
you'd tell it to the authorities?

48:51.640 --> 48:54.400
I would've done it 10 months ago, not now.

48:56.120 --> 48:58.400
Even knowing that your brother was there?

48:59.320 --> 49:00.360
Of course.

49:00.440 --> 49:01.440
Who knows...

49:03.320 --> 49:05.000
where Marta's body is?

49:06.200 --> 49:08.800
Well, I suppose the person
who got rid of it, right?

49:09.640 --> 49:13.560
If he doesn't know,
then someone has to know,

49:13.640 --> 49:14.920
but I certainly don't.

49:18.200 --> 49:20.200
Like in Tarantino movies,

49:20.920 --> 49:22.880
some people kill,

49:22.960 --> 49:25.640
and others arrive afterwards
to clean up the evidence.

49:26.120 --> 49:29.120
SEVILLE WON'T FORGET YOU

49:34.480 --> 49:37.520
SEPTEMBER 13, 2009

49:43.080 --> 49:45.920
Excuse me, are you still saying
what you said on Monday?

49:48.160 --> 49:50.440
<i>Miguel told me</i>
<i>that he was going to his house</i>

49:50.520 --> 49:53.840
<i>to deal with a problem with his brother</i>
<i>and get rid of some evidence.</i>

49:53.920 --> 49:57.760
<i>I asked him what evidence,</i>
<i>and he said there was a pool of blood.</i>

49:57.840 --> 50:00.880
<i>He said he'd been with Marta</i>
<i>that afternoon,</i> <i>they argued,</i>

50:00.960 --> 50:02.840
<i>and that his brother was in the room.</i>

50:02.920 --> 50:05.680
<i>He'd quarreled with Marta</i>
<i>and, in a fit of rage,</i>

50:05.760 --> 50:07.240
<i>he hit her with the ashtray.</i>

50:07.320 --> 50:11.960
<i>And once she was on the floor,</i>
<i>they both started hitting her.</i>

50:12.040 --> 50:14.000
<i>I asked him what he'd done,</i>

50:14.080 --> 50:17.320
<i>and Miguel told me</i>
<i>that they got rid of her.</i>

50:17.400 --> 50:20.880
<i>I asked Miguel</i>
<i>to tell me where Marta was</i>

50:20.960 --> 50:22.640
<i>because I didn't believe him.</i>

50:22.720 --> 50:26.960
<i>The following day, Miguel took me to Camas</i>
<i>and pointed to an area there.</i>

50:48.200 --> 50:49.840
SEPTEMBER 30, 2009

50:54.120 --> 50:58.920
There was a court order
to search a plot of land near Camas,

50:59.000 --> 51:02.520
and the police went to search there,

51:02.600 --> 51:05.320
as if it was the first time
they had done so.

51:10.560 --> 51:12.880
Then, all the friends
went there to search.

51:14.600 --> 51:17.680
The girl said that she was in this area,
so we'll search here.

51:17.760 --> 51:20.960
We don't know if she was lying or not.

51:21.040 --> 51:24.680
<i>Some neighbors</i>
<i>have started the search on their own</i>

51:24.760 --> 51:27.400
<i>and have found fragments</i>
<i>of a sheet with red stains on it,</i>

51:27.480 --> 51:29.040
<i>and pieces of tape.</i>

51:34.000 --> 51:36.400
It was hard to pull the blanket
out from the mud.

51:36.480 --> 51:39.680
It weighed so much that not even
five of us couldn't get it out.

51:39.760 --> 51:42.080
POLICE

51:42.160 --> 51:43.320
God, let her be there.

51:47.240 --> 51:50.320
Information started to come out
and hope began to grow.

51:51.160 --> 51:55.120
We were really hopeful
because it was close, it was logical,

51:55.200 --> 51:58.080
and it made a lot more sense
than the other previous versions.

52:02.640 --> 52:04.560
But that didn't pan out either.

52:21.400 --> 52:23.600
APRIL 12, 2010
THE INVESTIGATION COMES TO A CLOSE

52:23.680 --> 52:24.920
Everything was rushed.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.440
The judge also wanted
to finish the investigation,

52:27.520 --> 52:30.000
find out where Marta was,
and uncover the perpetrator.

52:30.080 --> 52:34.160
It was a live broadcast. Everything that
was happening was being shown on TV.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.760
CHIEF OF GRUME AND A COLLEAGUE

52:35.840 --> 52:39.240
<i>Don't overwhelm me like you have done</i>
<i>over the past year and a half.</i>

52:39.320 --> 52:41.960
<i>Give me a bit of time.</i>
<i>You're not letting me work.</i>

52:42.040 --> 52:43.920
<i>They haven't let us work.</i>

52:44.000 --> 52:45.920
<i>Things aren't being done</i>
<i>as they should be.</i>

52:46.000 --> 52:50.840
<i>Let's see if they can give us enough time,</i>
<i>so things don't get screwed up even more.</i>

52:50.920 --> 52:54.200
COURTHOUSE

52:54.280 --> 52:57.360
<i>There is major news today</i>
<i>in the Marta del Castillo case.</i>

52:57.440 --> 53:00.360
<i>The main suspects accused</i>
<i>of the alleged murder of the young girl</i>

53:00.440 --> 53:03.040
<i>have learned the charges</i>
<i>that they will be tried for.</i>

53:03.120 --> 53:05.280
Murder and rape for Miguel Carcaño,

53:05.360 --> 53:08.400
and concealment of a crime
for the other accused.

53:08.480 --> 53:11.720
We also heard some interesting comments
from the judge,

53:11.800 --> 53:15.400
who says the Marta del Castillo case
has been a highly unusual situation,

53:15.480 --> 53:17.360
plagued with unfortunate events,

53:17.440 --> 53:20.400
and which has never been seen before
in our criminal history.

53:20.480 --> 53:24.080
THE MARTA CASE: ONE CRIME, TWO TRIALS

53:24.160 --> 53:26.040
In the Marta case, there were two trials:

53:26.120 --> 53:29.120
one for "El Cuco,"
who, at that time, was a minor,

53:29.200 --> 53:30.720
and another for the adults.

53:30.800 --> 53:34.480
The legal treatment,
legislation, sentences...

53:34.560 --> 53:37.920
everything is different
when it comes to a trial for a minor.

53:43.720 --> 53:45.000
<i>We're live in Seville.</i>

53:45.080 --> 53:48.720
<i>It's the first day of the trial</i>
<i>in the disappearance and death of Marta.</i>

53:48.800 --> 53:52.880
<i>"El Cuco" arrived at the court in Seville</i>
<i>by car at 8 a.m., from the juvenile unit.</i>

53:52.960 --> 53:54.720
We are all Marta!

53:54.800 --> 53:58.400
<i>As he is a minor, he is facing</i>
<i>a maximum penalty of six years in prison,</i>

53:58.480 --> 54:00.160
<i>plus three years of probation.</i>

54:00.240 --> 54:02.440
Tell us already! It's been two years!

54:02.520 --> 54:05.400
<i>More than 100 reporters</i>
<i>have been approved to attend the trial.</i>

54:05.480 --> 54:09.560
<i>The court has been surrounded by dozens</i>
<i>of police officers to keep the peace.</i>

54:09.640 --> 54:11.360
<i>There is a tense atmosphere.</i>

54:11.440 --> 54:14.440
<i>The lawyer representing Carcaño's brother,</i>
<i>José Manuel Carrión,</i>

54:14.520 --> 54:16.760
<i>received a fierce reaction</i>
<i>from the public.</i>

54:21.400 --> 54:25.440
It was the first time in my life
that I'd entered a courthouse.

54:25.520 --> 54:28.640
I didn't know what it would be like inside
or what I would find.

54:32.040 --> 54:35.840
<i>Samuel Benítez, called to testify</i>
<i>as a witness in "El Cuco's" trial,</i>

54:35.920 --> 54:38.200
<i>entered unperturbed, his face uncovered.</i>

54:38.880 --> 54:43.760
Samuel, you have been called
to testify as a witness in this trial.

54:43.840 --> 54:45.440
Will you testify or not?

54:45.520 --> 54:47.560
-I won't testify.
<i>-</i>You won't testify.

54:47.640 --> 54:51.880
<i>Francisco Javier and girlfriend María</i>
<i>entered hugging and hiding their faces.</i>

54:51.960 --> 54:57.040
With all due respect to this court
and with the advice of my lawyer,

54:57.120 --> 55:00.240
I will not answer any questions
that are asked of me.

55:04.400 --> 55:07.120
-You are Miguel Carcaño Delgado, correct?
-Yes.

55:07.200 --> 55:09.720
You have the right
to not respond to anything

55:09.800 --> 55:12.480
that you believe
may be detrimental to your trial.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.840
Do you understand?

55:13.920 --> 55:15.800
-I won't testify.
-You won't testify.

55:17.520 --> 55:22.840
Naturally, I told Miguel
to invoke his right to not testify.

55:22.920 --> 55:26.760
Why? Because he still hadn't been tried.

55:31.600 --> 55:32.680
Good morning.

55:32.760 --> 55:36.040
Francisco Javier García Marín,
are you aware of the charges against you?

55:36.560 --> 55:38.360
-Are you aware of them, yes or no?
-Yes.

55:38.440 --> 55:41.240
Yes. How do you plead?
Guilty or innocent of the charges?

55:41.320 --> 55:42.480
Innocent.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.960
-On to the private prosecution.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

55:46.040 --> 55:49.160
So, Francisco Javier,
are you going to continue hiding the body?

55:49.240 --> 55:51.520
Isn't it time
you ended the family's suffering?

55:51.600 --> 55:53.120
Do you want me to make it up?

55:53.200 --> 55:56.480
Shall I do what Miguel does:
say she's in one place and then another?

55:56.560 --> 55:58.120
No, I'm telling the truth,

55:58.200 --> 55:59.800
whether you believe me or not.

55:59.880 --> 56:01.160
No further questions.

56:01.760 --> 56:04.640
The trial shall continue
when you're ready, Madame Prosecutor.

56:04.720 --> 56:05.840
Thank you, Your Honor.

56:05.920 --> 56:09.400
Francisco Javier, can you tell us why,
in Miguel's bedroom,

56:09.480 --> 56:11.800
there was a stain containing DNA

56:11.880 --> 56:14.480
with your genetic profile,
alongside that of Marta's?

56:14.560 --> 56:16.800
I was practically living
in that apartment.

56:16.880 --> 56:20.400
It's like going to my home
and saying my DNA is there.

56:20.480 --> 56:21.840
Would my DNA not be there?

56:21.920 --> 56:24.680
Francisco Javier, you admitted to helping

56:24.760 --> 56:28.120
Miguel and Samuel, up to four times,

56:28.200 --> 56:30.720
and in the presence of his brother
who threatened you,

56:30.800 --> 56:32.520
to get rid of Marta's body.

56:32.600 --> 56:34.640
But today, you say you didn't do it.

56:34.720 --> 56:36.680
Then why did you make those statements?

56:36.760 --> 56:38.840
I was under pressure from the police.

56:38.920 --> 56:40.200
Did you threaten the minor,

56:40.280 --> 56:42.680
saying that if he didn't
say what you wanted to hear,

56:42.760 --> 56:44.000
you'd arrest his mother?

56:44.080 --> 56:46.280
Never. I never threatened anyone.

56:46.360 --> 56:50.160
They were feeding me everything.
All that detailed information that I gave

56:50.240 --> 56:52.760
was everything
they'd told me that afternoon.

56:52.840 --> 56:55.360
But there were some things
that didn't make sense.

56:55.440 --> 56:57.400
You didn't say anything to your lawyer?

56:57.480 --> 57:00.440
No, because he knew
there were things that didn't make sense,

57:00.520 --> 57:01.920
like the times of the calls.

57:04.720 --> 57:08.080
It was very important
to know where each of them was

57:08.160 --> 57:09.760
when the events occurred.

57:09.840 --> 57:14.240
And we did that by tracking the positions
of the cell phone antennas.

57:15.080 --> 57:17.640
That also revealed inconsistencies...

57:18.880 --> 57:21.560
At around 11 p.m., I decided to go home

57:21.640 --> 57:25.640
and connect to Messenger for a while,
and then I went to sleep.

57:25.720 --> 57:27.280
And you didn't go out again?

57:27.360 --> 57:29.840
Not as far as I remember,
since I went to sleep.

57:29.920 --> 57:33.120
So you couldn't have been in the area

57:33.200 --> 57:37.080
of Avenida San Francisco Javier
at around 12:10 a.m.?

57:38.640 --> 57:40.000
As far as I remember, no.

57:40.080 --> 57:41.920
Where were you at that time?

57:42.000 --> 57:43.480
-At home.
-At his home.

57:43.560 --> 57:44.480
"EL CUCO'S" HOME

57:45.480 --> 57:49.240
You have studied all the call logs

57:49.320 --> 57:51.880
provided by the telephone companies.

57:51.960 --> 57:55.640
Could you tell us the minor's location
during the call at 12:10 a.m.?

57:55.720 --> 57:58.640
At 12:10 a.m.?
At Avenida San Francisco Javier.

57:58.720 --> 58:01.600
He said that he was at home at 11:30 p.m.

58:01.680 --> 58:04.840
So, if you're at home at 11:30 p.m.
and you don't go out again,

58:04.920 --> 58:07.480
but at 12:10 a.m.,
a repeater antenna shows

58:07.560 --> 58:10.640
that you're at Ave. San Francisco Javier,
what are you doing?

58:11.600 --> 58:13.600
You can take Francisco Javier away now.

58:15.600 --> 58:19.160
<i>The only minor</i>
<i>accused of the rape and murder</i>

58:19.240 --> 58:21.840
<i>of Marta del Castillo</i>
<i>is now ready for sentencing.</i>

58:21.920 --> 58:23.800
The prosecution and Marta's parents

58:23.880 --> 58:27.200
ask for six years in prison
and three years of probation.

58:28.680 --> 58:35.080
JANUARY 24, 2011 – MARCH 24, 2011

58:36.920 --> 58:41.080
<i>We now have a sentence in the first trial</i>
<i>of Marta del Castillo,</i>

58:41.160 --> 58:43.520
<i>the teenager murdered in Seville.</i>

58:43.600 --> 58:45.840
I remember I was working.

58:47.040 --> 58:49.520
Antonio called me on my cell phone,

58:49.600 --> 58:52.320
and I burst into tears there and then.

58:54.960 --> 58:56.040
Hello, good afternoon.

58:56.120 --> 58:58.760
The judge seems to have given
at least some credibility

58:58.840 --> 59:01.920
to the seventh version of Marta's death

59:02.000 --> 59:04.360
because, Elídice Benito,
there is new information.

59:05.680 --> 59:08.000
Yes, the judge
could call Francisco Javier,

59:08.080 --> 59:13.080
Miguel Carcaño's brother,
to testify tomorrow as a defendant,

59:13.160 --> 59:16.200
because Miguel Carcaño
has testified before the judge today

59:16.280 --> 59:19.760
and said that it was his brother
who murdered Marta del Castillo,

59:19.840 --> 59:21.040
and not him.

1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:44.240
