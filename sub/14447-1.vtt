00:27.773 --> 00:29.849
<i>Where's it all begin?</i>

00:29.949 --> 00:32.753
<i>Violence. The gun.</i>

00:32.854 --> 00:35.597
- Isabelle!
- <i>The knife. The axe.</i>

00:35.697 --> 00:39.784
- Isabelle, come here.
- <i>How's it born? How's it start?</i>

00:39.884 --> 00:44.810
<i>We all just wanna make it.
To live. To exist.</i>

00:44.910 --> 00:47.099
<i>Stay out of the hoosegow.</i>

00:47.199 --> 00:49.462
<i>We love if we're lucky.</i>

00:49.562 --> 00:53.365
<i>We lose, we're damaged. Hardened.</i>

00:53.465 --> 00:56.995
- Isabelle.
- <i>We do what we have to.</i>

00:57.235 --> 00:59.071
<i>What we are compelled to do.</i>

00:59.171 --> 01:02.908
Not true. I like Sidney
on account of his small prick.

01:03.008 --> 01:05.911
- Like a little mushroom.
- Easiest coin I ever earned.

01:06.011 --> 01:09.014
Barely even know it's in,
don't matter which hole.

01:09.114 --> 01:12.751
- He's a disgusting little man.
- With a perfect little prick.

01:12.851 --> 01:17.171
- Try not to talk so much like a whore.
- Try not to talk so much like a bitch.

01:17.371 --> 01:21.275
- I got a bad itch this week.
- It's those fat railway fucks.

01:21.375 --> 01:24.446
Dirtiest pricks in the entire county.

01:43.580 --> 01:45.059
Hey!

01:50.755 --> 01:53.344
Wait! Please, no!

01:58.562 --> 02:01.354
Grab the goddamn bag, goddammit!

02:06.636 --> 02:08.924
Don't shoot!

02:16.847 --> 02:19.602
Come on, don't dillydally!

02:29.429 --> 02:32.294
Get outta there, kid!

02:54.952 --> 02:58.774
Samuel! Get up here and thread this mark.

03:07.697 --> 03:10.600
- What do you think?
- They pretty far shucked.

03:10.700 --> 03:15.734
- And I got these old eyes.
- Sam, you slower than molasses in January.

03:27.317 --> 03:29.660
How the fuck these pricks
get the bulge on a lawman?

03:29.760 --> 03:32.498
We was just making a deposit, is all.

03:33.025 --> 03:35.101
A deposit.

03:35.726 --> 03:39.531
- I wasn't ready.
- Mayor Bishop is dead.

03:39.631 --> 03:41.633
Goddammit!

03:42.033 --> 03:44.401
Bled out real fast.

03:44.501 --> 03:46.185
Fuck all.

03:50.574 --> 03:53.110
Post the bounties,

03:53.210 --> 03:55.712
then get Josiah on it.

03:55.812 --> 03:58.750
Top coin. I don't give a shit how much.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.971
Just get it done.

04:47.865 --> 04:49.753
Josiah?

04:52.470 --> 04:56.436
They dragged him off somewhere.
No time to bury him.

04:58.309 --> 05:00.911
Mayhap I should have the men
start peeking for the body?

05:01.011 --> 05:03.381
Yeah, have them round it up,
chop off the top.

05:03.481 --> 05:06.628
If he sees fit, he can keep the coin.
I don't care.

05:06.728 --> 05:09.185
We gotta keep heading south.

05:09.285 --> 05:11.422
Don't wanna give them any time to breathe.

05:11.522 --> 05:15.078
We slag any longer,
we're going to lose the track.

05:17.327 --> 05:21.698
Boys, saddle up.
We ain't but a half day behind 'em.

05:21.798 --> 05:24.836
I ain't used my axe in a while...

05:24.936 --> 05:28.861
and I'd be lyin' if I said
I wasn't looking forward to it.

06:02.072 --> 06:04.659
Charlie, what you playing at?

06:08.813 --> 06:11.534
Bang, bang, bang.

06:14.786 --> 06:17.187
- Look like hell, boy.
- Yeah, we're here, ain't we?

06:17.287 --> 06:20.691
- The worst is comin' soon.
- Shut your yap.

06:21.091 --> 06:23.393
Boys'll be fine. Be prepared, is all.

06:23.493 --> 06:26.197
Sure is good to see you, Aunt Esther.
You ain't aged a day.

06:26.297 --> 06:29.666
I don't like it one bit
what you boys got yourselves into.

06:29.766 --> 06:32.154
Shut your yap!

06:33.069 --> 06:35.507
Don't listen to her, Charlie.
She don't know nothin'.

06:35.607 --> 06:39.202
- You better keep your hands off that lady.
- It's fine, boys.

06:39.302 --> 06:44.081
I don't make no habit, but a woman
needs discipline at the proper time.

06:44.181 --> 06:47.317
Just hand over the supplies,
we'll be on our way.

06:47.417 --> 06:51.856
No need to bulldoze, son. Me and Esther
came and done this on our own accord.

06:51.956 --> 06:56.078
I didn't come nowhere
on nobody's own accord.

06:57.427 --> 07:00.230
I think all y'all be on-the-shoot.

07:00.330 --> 07:03.434
All y'all gonna have to answer
to the Good Lord soon.

07:03.534 --> 07:06.222
Shut your yap!

07:09.471 --> 07:11.887
Now you listen here, old man.

07:11.987 --> 07:14.344
- I'm big bug around here.
- No, no! Let him be!

07:14.444 --> 07:17.785
You try that again, I'm gonna clean
your plow real good. You understand?

07:17.885 --> 07:20.636
Henry, he can't breathe.

07:27.190 --> 07:30.178
I'm fine, woman, I'm fine!

07:30.911 --> 07:32.783
Well?

07:33.663 --> 07:35.364
Hey!

07:36.300 --> 07:38.870
You're gonna wanna go down
on the east side,

07:38.970 --> 07:42.907
through Rock Canyon... and White Sands.

07:43.007 --> 07:45.475
Cross over outside of El Paso.

07:45.575 --> 07:49.247
West trail's better.
Through Deming, cross in Columbus.

07:49.347 --> 07:52.166
Ain't nothing on the east side
from here to the border. We'll dies.

07:52.266 --> 07:57.021
Exactly. Ain't nobody dumb enough
to track you that way.

07:57.321 --> 08:01.626
- Who says they're tracking?
- There's bounty on your heads.

08:01.726 --> 08:05.058
- Eight thousand, all in.
- You're joshin'.

08:05.158 --> 08:09.781
I wish I was...
for my nephew's sake, but I ain't.

08:10.001 --> 08:13.021
That man y'all shot, he died.

08:13.121 --> 08:17.775
Government official.
Right and proper from another county.

08:17.875 --> 08:21.180
Bad luck!
He was a friend of Sheriff Mckay.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.281
- They was compadres.
- Dammit all to hell!

08:24.381 --> 08:27.219
- I told you not to shoot that...
- Hobble your lip, Charlie.

08:27.319 --> 08:30.339
And that poor young woman, too.

08:31.622 --> 08:34.174
We didn't kill no woman. That's a lie.

08:34.274 --> 08:38.365
You see how cruel you is?
You didn't even notice!

08:41.765 --> 08:45.236
- Two-thousand each?
- Thousand on each of the boys.

08:45.336 --> 08:46.970
The rest is on you.

08:47.070 --> 08:50.208
They don't know us. No way they could.

08:50.308 --> 08:55.109
Tall man with the ivory grips
is what they call you.

08:55.209 --> 08:58.149
- And the... the fat man.
- Who's the fat man?

08:58.249 --> 09:01.079
Masks don't cover all it up.

09:01.179 --> 09:03.721
If they don't catch you now,
you be alright.

09:03.821 --> 09:07.993
They don't know your faces,
but they gonna come at you hard,

09:08.093 --> 09:11.762
especially you,
until you're good and gone.

09:14.430 --> 09:17.100
- East trail it is.
- Horses can't make it.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.471
- We can't carry enough water...
- If they die, we'll foot it.

09:20.571 --> 09:22.473
You can't foot if you can't drink.

09:22.573 --> 09:24.308
Well...

09:24.408 --> 09:27.744
let's hope that don't happen
till the final stretch.

09:27.844 --> 09:30.899
Plenty of green patches on the other side.

09:44.028 --> 09:46.097
Fuck all, Henry!

09:46.197 --> 09:49.051
Man, you done fucked the rooster.

09:50.467 --> 09:52.888
Dammit all to hell!

09:54.104 --> 09:55.906
No.

09:56.006 --> 09:59.844
Sorry, ma'am. I truly am.

10:00.144 --> 10:02.479
Goddammit, Henry.

10:02.579 --> 10:05.268
You can't shoot no woman.

10:07.518 --> 10:09.185
Joe.

10:09.285 --> 10:11.401
Joe! Joe!

10:11.501 --> 10:14.643
Don't you do it, you fuckin' cow head.

10:21.731 --> 10:26.170
My kin! They's my goddamn kin!
You done crossed the line.

10:26.270 --> 10:30.727
You know as well as I do,
$8,000's enough to turn anyone.

10:31.942 --> 10:34.963
Even kin, Henry. Even kin.

10:48.058 --> 10:50.459
Alright, hand it to your sister.

10:50.559 --> 10:54.164
- But I wanna do it again, Papa.
- Now, Charlotte, let's give a turn.

10:54.264 --> 10:57.552
- Papa!
- Don't talk back to me, girl.

11:12.282 --> 11:15.181
Well... I'll be.

11:15.281 --> 11:17.588
All youse good at is boy things,
you ugly rut.

11:17.688 --> 11:19.757
Hush up.

11:20.157 --> 11:22.510
I'll fetch more rounds.

11:47.617 --> 11:52.349
You disgusting bitch.
You got clitchy chuck all over my fingers.

11:56.894 --> 11:58.981
Get up.

12:06.636 --> 12:08.890
You alright, Button?

12:09.840 --> 12:11.927
Alright, then.

12:16.197 --> 12:18.200
Hey, now.

12:18.949 --> 12:23.188
Never, ever point a gun at somebody
unless you intend to bed 'em down.

12:24.088 --> 12:26.574
You bitch, I dare you.

12:28.459 --> 12:31.060
Florence Ethel Tildon!

12:31.160 --> 12:33.664
You put that gun down at once,

12:33.764 --> 12:37.286
or you're gonna get a whoopin'
like you've never had.

12:39.769 --> 12:42.357
I was just kiddin', Daddy.

16:34.238 --> 16:37.760
- Flo, you go to your daddy now.
- I'll go.

16:38.541 --> 16:42.112
Best get in there, give your daddy a rubdown
before supper unless you want a whippin'.

16:42.212 --> 16:45.230
- I'll go, Mama.
- Hush now, Charlotte. It's Flo's turn.

16:45.330 --> 16:48.785
- But she got to...
- No buts. You do as you're told and shut it.

16:48.885 --> 16:51.822
- Let her go, Mama. I don't...
- No buts for you either, young lady!

16:51.922 --> 16:54.209
Now git!

16:59.929 --> 17:02.184
That's a good girl.

17:18.714 --> 17:22.671
These bodies been out here
a lot longer than I like.

17:26.123 --> 17:28.958
Josie. There's something over yonder.

17:29.058 --> 17:31.312
In the bushes.

17:34.731 --> 17:36.585
Alright.

17:37.267 --> 17:40.303
Whoever you be, I implore you,
reveal yourself.

17:40.403 --> 17:42.339
We ain't gonna hurt you,

17:42.439 --> 17:45.440
long as you come out slow-like.

17:47.677 --> 17:49.964
Last chance.

18:01.090 --> 18:03.611
What's your name, little girl?

18:04.177 --> 18:06.864
Don't be scared. Come here.

18:08.264 --> 18:10.651
All's good now.

18:10.967 --> 18:12.975
What's your name?

18:13.075 --> 18:14.889
Lulu.

18:16.672 --> 18:18.542
Well...

18:18.842 --> 18:22.097
that's a pretty name. Lulu.

18:23.446 --> 18:25.781
What happened out here?

18:25.881 --> 18:27.918
And who are you to those folks?

18:28.018 --> 18:30.668
My Grammy and Grampy got shot good.

18:30.988 --> 18:34.492
- Yeah. Who shot 'em, honey?
- I couldn't see them good,

18:34.592 --> 18:37.460
but I could hear them. Bad men.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.130
Yeah, bad men.

18:40.230 --> 18:45.200
Now, do you know why the bad men
wanted to shoot your grandfolks?

18:45.300 --> 18:48.406
Not sure.
I thought they were good at first,

18:48.506 --> 18:52.509
and just getting Grampy
'cause he beat on us, but...

18:52.809 --> 18:54.678
But what, honey?

18:54.778 --> 18:57.380
But then they bed down Grammy.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.916
And that ain't right. I loved my Grammy.

19:00.016 --> 19:03.320
When I heard them do that,
I sunk down in the brush.

19:03.420 --> 19:06.747
I prayed Jesus till they went away.
They did.

19:06.847 --> 19:10.561
But then the horses run off
and I was stuck. I can ride.

19:10.661 --> 19:13.364
If the horses was here, I could've!

19:13.464 --> 19:17.134
Now, I know this is hard, Lulu, but...

19:17.234 --> 19:19.570
I need to know what those men said.

19:19.670 --> 19:22.873
They said a lot of bad words
I shouldn't say.

19:22.973 --> 19:26.611
No, not like that.
I need to know where they went.

19:26.711 --> 19:30.380
They said they was going east,
through White Sands.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.488
- That's impossible.
- That's what they said! I ain't lying!

19:33.588 --> 19:37.186
No... that makes sense.

19:37.286 --> 19:40.723
They know we'd have to be cracked
to follow 'em down those parts.

19:40.823 --> 19:43.092
Well, I ain't cracked.

19:43.192 --> 19:45.748
Ain't no coin worth that.

19:51.035 --> 19:52.668
Goddamn.

19:52.768 --> 19:56.725
What you get for talking
out your neck, yellow scamp.

20:02.813 --> 20:07.216
- Sorry, Lulu.
- It's okay. He had it comin'.

20:07.316 --> 20:11.437
Yeah. Now, we're gonna have
the yellow man take the girl back to town,

20:11.537 --> 20:13.689
we'll push on.

20:13.789 --> 20:15.625
Boss...

20:16.125 --> 20:18.681
maybe we should think about this.

20:19.462 --> 20:21.330
I thought about it.

20:21.430 --> 20:26.214
I think you oughta get on your
fucking horse, we'll go get some heads.

20:41.249 --> 20:44.354
I'm starting to wonder
if we's dead and gone to hell.

20:44.454 --> 20:45.956
Left rung...

20:46.056 --> 20:47.858
firebug...

20:47.958 --> 20:49.825
snatch... wart.

20:49.925 --> 20:53.162
You go and you get the pillow.

20:53.262 --> 20:55.865
What the hell you yappin' about?

20:55.965 --> 21:00.460
Build it! Build it strong with the logger
and the roots, big John!

21:00.560 --> 21:02.890
You okay, Maddie?

21:03.807 --> 21:07.238
Probably too late to save myself
from the fire, but I'm gonna die tryin'.

21:07.338 --> 21:10.472
Hallelujah and praise Jesus.

21:12.181 --> 21:14.617
You mind your place.

21:14.717 --> 21:17.019
I was just joshin'.

21:17.119 --> 21:19.140
I wasn't.

21:19.755 --> 21:23.994
- I need some water, boys.
- I'm hungry, goddammit.

21:24.617 --> 21:28.450
Sun up, sundown
and back again with no eats.

21:29.098 --> 21:33.121
- Steak'd be nice.
- Now he's joshin'.

21:40.209 --> 21:42.096
Henry?

21:48.819 --> 21:51.105
He gone.

21:51.555 --> 21:53.409
Almost.

21:54.124 --> 21:56.459
Whole side of his head's rotten.

21:56.559 --> 21:59.063
Yeah, well, better him than us.

21:59.763 --> 22:02.084
I didn't mind him.

22:02.499 --> 22:07.036
I'm not gonna talk ill of the dead,
but I didn't care for him much anyway.

22:07.136 --> 22:09.939
You just spoke ill of a dead, Charlie.

22:10.039 --> 22:12.427
Shut the fuck up, Joe.

22:15.111 --> 22:18.499
He's not quite dead yet,
but he's almost there.

22:19.114 --> 22:23.286
- Put him out?
- Waste of a good round, if you ask me.

22:24.921 --> 22:27.341
Well, that ain't nice at all.

22:56.552 --> 22:58.840
Goddammit!

23:01.257 --> 23:03.711
You happy now?

24:10.360 --> 24:14.764
- I gots to have eats, Henry.
- What we needs is some whores.

24:14.864 --> 24:18.969
No eats or we die. If we die,
whores won't gonna matter.

24:19.569 --> 24:22.409
- You're a smart one, kid.
- That's real funny.

24:22.509 --> 24:24.808
Henry might as well dropped
a pile a shit in your mouth.

24:24.908 --> 24:26.743
Shut your yap, Charlie.
I'll kills ya dead.

24:26.843 --> 24:30.246
- I'll make you a goner, you dirty halfwit.
- Hobble your lips.

24:30.346 --> 24:32.148
Can't go much farther
without horses, Henry.

24:32.248 --> 24:35.052
My foot's swole
and these bags is like lead.

24:35.152 --> 24:36.973
Back.

24:39.088 --> 24:41.175
Get down.

24:46.463 --> 24:48.684
Well, I'll be.

24:49.399 --> 24:51.901
That ain't no town, Henry.

24:52.001 --> 24:53.569
Nope.

24:53.669 --> 24:56.038
Town can't be too far.

24:56.138 --> 24:58.775
Gotta get their congregation somewhere.

24:58.875 --> 25:01.262
They might have eats.

25:02.411 --> 25:04.865
They'll have eats.

25:05.515 --> 25:07.969
And they'll have horses.

25:09.685 --> 25:11.906
Alright, boys.

25:13.056 --> 25:15.310
We hit 'em at dark.

25:34.377 --> 25:37.531
- Cackleberries?
- Yes, dear.

25:49.025 --> 25:50.826
No, no. That'll do just fine.

25:50.926 --> 25:53.647
- Charlotte?
- Yes, please.

25:54.931 --> 25:57.234
- Florence?
- Can't handle no more cackleberries.

25:57.334 --> 26:00.003
I can't handle any more cackleberries
is the proper way, Florence.

26:00.103 --> 26:04.739
- I know, Mama, but Daddy always says it.
- Do as I say, not as I do, girl.

26:04.839 --> 26:07.250
- Yes, Papa.
- You acts like you all big and smart,

26:07.350 --> 26:10.327
- but you can't even says it right.
- Leave me alone, Sissy.

26:10.427 --> 26:12.649
I'll leave you alone
when I want to, you dirty whore.

26:12.749 --> 26:16.518
- Hey, now!
- Watch your language, young lady!

26:16.618 --> 26:19.055
She should get a soap mouth
for saying that curse.

26:19.155 --> 26:21.958
Only dumb ugly girls like you
get soap mouths.

26:22.058 --> 26:25.213
Hey! Cut it out now!

26:25.761 --> 26:28.583
One more word and I will get the stick.

26:32.168 --> 26:34.889
Please say grace, Georgie.

26:40.844 --> 26:46.565
Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest,
and let these gifts to us be blessed.

26:46.665 --> 26:49.599
- Amen.
- Amen.

26:56.625 --> 27:00.033
- Tastes real nice, Mama.
- Well, thank you, honey.

27:00.663 --> 27:02.598
Yep, mighty nice.

27:02.698 --> 27:06.635
- Are we gonna have milk again soon?
- Cow looks bony.

27:06.735 --> 27:09.939
Can't figure if it's old age
or just not enough feed.

27:10.139 --> 27:14.710
The good Lord will always get us through.
Just testing us, that's all.

27:14.910 --> 27:18.199
Yep, testing us good.

27:19.816 --> 27:23.420
In all that plagues us in this world,
all the darkness,

27:23.520 --> 27:27.041
there will always be a little God to find.

27:27.857 --> 27:30.177
And it's a beauty to behold. Praise Jesus.

27:30.277 --> 27:32.818
Praise Jesus.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.971
Hold on. Hold on now.
Stop eating right quick.

27:41.071 --> 27:43.338
Mama, I'm hungry.
Can I please just finish...

27:43.438 --> 27:46.608
Your mama's feelin'
the Holy Spirit now, Flo.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.955
Ain't no way to plan for when it comes.

27:49.055 --> 27:50.847
Here it is.

27:50.947 --> 27:55.184
"He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
and herb for the service of man,

27:55.284 --> 27:57.555
"that he may bring forth food
out of the earth,

27:57.655 --> 28:01.457
and wine that maketh glad
the heart of men..."

28:02.957 --> 28:07.863
Well, that's for some men,
in the biblical times. Not for you, Georgie.

28:07.963 --> 28:10.799
- 'Course not.
- Nor for you girls.

28:10.899 --> 28:13.503
I reckon that's stated proper,
'cause it says men, not women.

28:13.603 --> 28:15.861
Women ain't allowed
to do nothing in that book.

28:15.961 --> 28:19.275
Back in those times,
back in those times...

28:19.375 --> 28:21.376
drink was different.

28:21.476 --> 28:25.866
Now it's the whiskey, got the devil in it.

28:27.283 --> 28:29.519
The devil's work.

28:29.619 --> 28:33.423
The devil's work is not right.

28:33.523 --> 28:35.777
It's not right.

28:37.393 --> 28:40.868
Sweetheart...
don't let yourself get all worked up.

28:40.968 --> 28:43.187
It's gotta stop.

28:43.899 --> 28:46.936
Go on there, read us the rest.

28:47.036 --> 28:50.373
Yes, of course.
"Thou makest darkness, and it is night,

28:50.473 --> 28:53.542
"wherein all the beasts
of the forest do creep forth.

28:53.642 --> 28:58.148
"The young lions roar after their prey,
and seek their meat from God!"

28:58.248 --> 29:00.450
They seek their meat,

29:00.550 --> 29:05.421
they seek their meat from He, God, Him.

29:05.521 --> 29:08.123
Only He can bring us the grass
for the cow.

29:08.223 --> 29:10.958
Only he can bring healing to the town

29:11.058 --> 29:14.204
and steady congregation to us once again.

29:15.230 --> 29:18.820
We do the work, but He decides.

29:19.101 --> 29:22.455
- You must always remember that.
- Always, Mama.

29:22.555 --> 29:26.108
Be thankful, no matter how dark the time.

29:26.208 --> 29:28.411
And worship.

29:28.511 --> 29:31.733
- Praise Jesus.
- Praise Jesus.

29:45.595 --> 29:47.529
You may eat.

30:03.312 --> 30:05.315
Go! Go!

30:10.786 --> 30:13.107
Well, I'll be.

30:14.090 --> 30:16.010
Dinnertime.

30:16.110 --> 30:18.445
Back in your chair, ma'am.

30:21.846 --> 30:24.067
Take a settle.

30:25.634 --> 30:28.991
- Flo, get your hands up!
- No need for that, mister.

30:30.171 --> 30:32.660
Y'all can put your hands down.

30:36.379 --> 30:38.281
You heeled?

30:38.381 --> 30:40.935
Just my scatter gun over yonder.

30:45.421 --> 30:47.061
There's another.

30:47.161 --> 30:50.112
Under the bed in the sleep room.
Six-shooter.

30:55.665 --> 30:58.633
- Daddy, look what she did!
- They found it, they'd kill us.

30:58.733 --> 31:00.703
It's okay, honey.

31:00.803 --> 31:03.038
Smart young lady you got there.

31:04.138 --> 31:06.459
Now, mister...

31:07.842 --> 31:12.399
Mister, I'm trying real hard
to be as nice as I damn well can.

31:13.115 --> 31:15.619
Ain't gonna tell you more than once.

31:16.019 --> 31:18.354
Don't you ever lie to me.

31:18.454 --> 31:20.542
Yes, sir.

31:21.423 --> 31:23.460
That it?

31:24.160 --> 31:25.847
Alright, then.

31:29.597 --> 31:32.534
- He isn't gonna kill us?
- Hush now.

31:32.634 --> 31:35.304
Can I ask what exactly it is
we can do for you boys?

31:35.404 --> 31:39.809
You look like good boys. Good Christians.
You wouldn't hurt us, now would you?

31:39.909 --> 31:42.878
I can assure you, ma'am,
these ain't good boys I got here.

31:42.978 --> 31:47.568
And I myself, well, I's a hard case.

31:50.352 --> 31:54.024
- But we ain't here to do no killin'.
- I gots to have eats.

31:54.124 --> 31:56.325
Well, ses, sir. We have...

31:56.425 --> 32:00.981
hens' eggs and bean sludge for you.
Nice and hot.

32:06.169 --> 32:08.673
I think we strike gold, Henry.

32:08.773 --> 32:13.194
If you're all finished, I'd ask you
to slide yourselves down yonder.

32:14.410 --> 32:17.198
Get a wiggle on. Come on.

32:31.526 --> 32:34.815
Keep your fire pointed
at their noggins, Joe!

32:42.837 --> 32:45.248
- Where'd all that blood come from?
- Shut it now, girl!

32:45.348 --> 32:49.941
Why's she trying to get us
full of bullets? Quit pokin' at 'em.

32:50.346 --> 32:54.416
Nothin' wrong with the young lady
wanting to have a little conversation.

32:54.516 --> 32:57.658
She's just a dumb, stupid kid, sir.

33:02.392 --> 33:05.693
Looks like a lady to me
if I ever seen one.

33:08.330 --> 33:11.886
- She's just stupid.
- You're stupid.

33:13.836 --> 33:15.605
Alright.

33:15.705 --> 33:18.374
Let's be nice to each other
as we pass the time.

33:18.474 --> 33:21.209
- I'm sorry, Sissy.
- No, you ain't.

33:21.309 --> 33:24.247
- Well, yes, I am.
- No, you ain't.

33:24.347 --> 33:26.833
Yes, she is already!

33:34.257 --> 33:38.961
- How many horses, mister?
- Only two, sir, and they's crows' bait.

33:39.061 --> 33:41.230
Other two died in the freeze-out.

33:41.330 --> 33:43.942
Dammit! Dammit all to hell!

33:44.042 --> 33:46.553
I got two pack mules, sir.
Mayhap that'll help.

33:46.653 --> 33:49.255
I ain't ridin' no pack ass.

33:49.405 --> 33:53.761
We'll take the horses,
put Little Joe on one of them mules.

33:54.743 --> 33:56.745
Mighty slow movin'.

33:56.845 --> 33:59.333
It'll get us to the meet-up.

34:03.485 --> 34:05.339
Alright.

34:07.622 --> 34:09.958
Listen here, mister.

34:10.059 --> 34:15.364
We ain't gonna hurt you none
as long as you go along. Alright?

34:15.465 --> 34:18.922
We're gonna have a breath, wash up,
get some shuteye.

34:19.023 --> 34:22.377
Then, at daylight,
we're gonna light a shuck outta here.

34:22.476 --> 34:25.859
Well, what if the lawmen comes tonight?

34:26.808 --> 34:31.080
- That's the smartest thing he's ever said.
- They wouldn't track us this far.

34:31.179 --> 34:35.344
If they had the sand to do it,
they'd be tracking dead horses.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.554
We got time.

34:38.654 --> 34:40.511
You don't know that.

34:40.610 --> 34:43.824
I don't care a continental
what you think I know or don't know.

34:43.925 --> 34:46.931
- What'd y'all do to get in a fix like this?
- What'd I tell you, girl?

34:47.031 --> 34:49.598
It's their own, private business, Flo.

34:49.697 --> 34:52.857
I know what you're thinking, mister.
But we ain't like that.

34:52.956 --> 34:55.471
- Like what?
- We ain't killers.

34:55.571 --> 34:59.085
We bank thieves. We only beefed them
'cause they was trying to beef us.

34:59.185 --> 35:01.328
I knew we should've held off
when we saw who was in there.

35:01.428 --> 35:04.012
- Rather be in a bone orchard?
- Might as well be.

35:04.112 --> 35:07.467
More money on our noggins
than Jesse James.

35:09.085 --> 35:12.652
- Hobble that lip, Joe.
- We didn't hear nothin', sir.

35:12.752 --> 35:16.826
I'm sure you's good boys...
just had to do what you had to do.

35:16.926 --> 35:21.412
- How much? How much money on your heads?
- Keep it shut now!

35:28.037 --> 35:32.694
Only way we're gonna kill you
is if you don't go along.

35:34.408 --> 35:37.347
Liar. You'll kill us either way.

35:37.447 --> 35:41.052
- That one there's got a lip on her.
- A mighty fine lip.

35:42.652 --> 35:44.973
You sure got sand, lady.

35:49.392 --> 35:51.627
Most cases...

35:51.727 --> 35:53.586
you'd be right.

35:53.686 --> 35:55.620
But...

35:56.020 --> 36:00.068
- we ain't up for doin' that no more.
- You ain't into doin' that no more.

36:00.168 --> 36:04.107
- Unless need be, of course.
- How you know we won't squeal?

36:04.207 --> 36:07.376
Because he knows we won't. Right, sir?

36:07.576 --> 36:10.245
We're gonna make you flush, honey.

36:10.345 --> 36:13.615
Rich people... they don't like to squeal.

36:13.715 --> 36:17.473
That's mighty generous of you,
mighty generous.

36:17.573 --> 36:20.757
- We've never been flush before, have we?
- No, honey. No, we haven't.

36:20.857 --> 36:24.226
Make us lighter for the ride,
won't it, Charlie?

36:24.326 --> 36:27.797
- Sure will, big bug.
- How far to the border?

36:28.397 --> 36:32.501
Little less than a day's ride.
Maybe a little longer, draggin' plow.

36:32.601 --> 36:35.088
Might be nice to get roostered.

36:36.037 --> 36:38.431
Please, Henry?

36:38.531 --> 36:42.535
A few nips couldn't hurt.
You got any red eye?

36:44.546 --> 36:48.370
There's some for medicinal matters
in the sleep room.

37:06.268 --> 37:08.804
What is it you called, ma'am?

37:09.204 --> 37:11.901
Her name's Ada,
but that don't seem important.

37:12.174 --> 37:17.007
Just be a good boy. I know you's
a good boy who believes in Jesus.

37:18.346 --> 37:20.817
I'll show you a good boy.

37:20.917 --> 37:23.919
Come here, sit in my lap.

37:24.419 --> 37:26.089
I will do no such thing.

37:26.189 --> 37:30.059
You best not be making a mash
on no married woman loves Jesus.

37:30.159 --> 37:33.269
- I'm just having a little...
- You ain't having nothing unless I say so.

37:33.369 --> 37:35.197
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

37:35.297 --> 37:37.830
You should go for that one.

37:38.067 --> 37:39.935
I'd rather die
than to let you put your fil...

37:40.035 --> 37:42.866
Shut it, gyp face. I'd rather die than
to put my filthy hands on your pasty...

37:42.966 --> 37:47.042
- Throw up the sponge, kid.
- She laid into me first!

37:47.742 --> 37:50.197
You ain't seen what I saw.

37:51.974 --> 37:55.268
She been givin' me the eye
ever since we walked in here.

37:56.786 --> 37:59.689
Just tell me which one I'm sticking it in.

37:59.789 --> 38:02.926
Then I'll get right to it
soon as I'm done washing up.

38:03.026 --> 38:05.961
You behave yourself
and be a good ol' boy, Joseph.

38:06.061 --> 38:08.685
Need you to keep outside watch tonight.

38:18.907 --> 38:22.144
- Mister, is the girl married?
- No, I'm not.

38:22.244 --> 38:25.882
But I don't have any interest
in boys or leavin' home.

38:25.982 --> 38:29.987
She can't get in the family way.
Fever got her when she's young.

38:30.087 --> 38:32.304
Makes it hard.

38:32.855 --> 38:35.241
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:36.290 --> 38:38.980
- But when I asked, I meant her.
- Her?

38:39.080 --> 38:41.295
Yeah, her.

38:41.395 --> 38:43.164
She hitched?

38:43.264 --> 38:45.485
No, sir.

38:46.135 --> 38:48.571
She's only 15.

38:48.671 --> 38:51.240
Seems like she got some time.

38:51.924 --> 38:55.029
Most boys in the town with consumption.

39:01.817 --> 39:04.304
What's your name, little bug?

39:05.654 --> 39:08.074
We call her Florence.

39:10.191 --> 39:12.413
Well, I'll be.

39:12.828 --> 39:16.498
That's a sweet little name
for such a sweet little bug.

39:16.598 --> 39:19.002
Please leave our girls to themselves, sir.

39:19.102 --> 39:22.857
We keep 'em pure
and in the path of Christ.

39:24.707 --> 39:26.674
She a pretty lady.

39:26.774 --> 39:31.113
- I don't like where this is going.
- She ain't no lady. She's just a girl.

39:31.213 --> 39:35.244
- Ain't any lady is the proper way, Mama.
- This ain't time for joking, Flo.

39:35.344 --> 39:38.587
- This man intends...
- I intend to what, ma'am?

39:38.887 --> 39:41.489
- I don't like what you're getting at.
- Don't mind my wife, sir.

39:41.589 --> 39:44.245
She knows you don't intend
nothing sinister.

39:47.462 --> 39:49.798
Why don't you hop up here on my lap now?

39:50.998 --> 39:55.111
Now you wait a second there, sir!
You leave my daughter be,

39:55.211 --> 39:58.056
or you gonna have to fight me
like Kilkenny cats, guns or no guns!

39:58.156 --> 40:00.544
That's rich.

40:11.454 --> 40:15.023
- Georgie! Christ in Heaven!
- Papa!

40:15.523 --> 40:19.562
- Papa! Papa!
- Ain't gonna be no fight, mister.

40:19.662 --> 40:22.497
- You ain't a good man.
- Never said I was.

40:22.597 --> 40:25.560
- You're a curly wolf.
- Maybe.

40:26.035 --> 40:28.171
You killed him!

40:28.571 --> 40:31.892
He ain't dead. He's just boogered up.

40:33.708 --> 40:35.674
Now pony up, little bug.

40:35.774 --> 40:38.018
I ain't gonna hurt you.

40:39.681 --> 40:43.606
- Come on, missy.
- No! No, don't you touch her!

40:44.821 --> 40:46.673
Hey!

40:47.089 --> 40:49.542
No need for that, Charlie.

40:50.959 --> 40:53.747
She was comin' on her own legs.

40:54.596 --> 40:56.766
Maybe I was, maybe I wasn't.

40:56.866 --> 40:59.701
Still don't like him pushing me places.

40:59.801 --> 41:02.122
That's fair enough, bug.

41:04.472 --> 41:07.827
Florence. Florence! No!

41:10.544 --> 41:12.481
You best stay where you is.

41:12.581 --> 41:16.668
Be a good boy and make him stop,
on account of Jesus!

41:17.987 --> 41:19.789
Joe!

41:19.989 --> 41:22.654
I don't know nothin' about Jesus.

41:24.158 --> 41:26.546
No need for that shit.

41:29.932 --> 41:32.152
Sorry, Henry.

41:41.876 --> 41:44.097
Alright now.

41:44.947 --> 41:49.170
Go on, little bug...
take yourself a nice nip.

41:57.191 --> 42:00.597
- He needs a doctor.
- Broke nose don't need no doctor.

42:00.797 --> 42:03.565
Keep that flannel mouth shut, girl.

42:03.865 --> 42:06.100
Everything's fine.

42:06.200 --> 42:09.522
I... I don't need no doctor.

42:10.039 --> 42:14.376
- I'm just fine.
- You see? Told you so.

42:15.877 --> 42:19.699
He only hit me
on account of my threatening.

42:20.816 --> 42:24.753
- It's my own damn fault.
- Now, that's the spirit, mister.

42:25.953 --> 42:28.341
My apologies, ma'am.

42:28.656 --> 42:31.526
No excuse for what he done.

42:31.926 --> 42:34.214
I'm alright.

42:35.297 --> 42:38.519
You just as fine as cream gravy.

42:40.001 --> 42:42.489
You like sitting up here?

42:44.606 --> 42:47.828
Like it better
if you didn't stink so darn bad.

42:51.814 --> 42:54.415
Young lady's got a point.

42:54.515 --> 42:58.201
- I'll bet we smell worse than pigs in shit.
- I told you I need a wash.

42:58.301 --> 43:00.656
My parts itches.

43:00.756 --> 43:03.476
Where's the bathing happen around here?

44:25.539 --> 44:27.541
You boys get watered up.

44:27.641 --> 44:30.698
We'll trade posts
when you're done cleanin'.

44:56.804 --> 45:01.694
You wanna... get yourself
washed up, you best do it now.

45:02.810 --> 45:05.216
Your family should pony up, as well.

45:06.146 --> 45:09.669
They'd like to water up now,
that's their concern.

45:45.069 --> 45:48.158
What in Jesus's name
does she think she doing?

45:49.757 --> 45:52.426
That's a smart girl.

45:52.526 --> 45:56.264
It's mighty fine, what she's layin' out.
Don't you reckon?

45:56.664 --> 45:58.952
Reckon what?

46:01.102 --> 46:04.057
She's trying to save our lives.

46:23.392 --> 46:26.160
If you told I'd gotten a chill...

46:26.260 --> 46:30.283
six marks on a clock ago,
I'd have laughed you down.

46:31.566 --> 46:35.788
Wind's coming at night beast-like
this time of the year.

46:37.806 --> 46:40.194
Fire feels nice.

46:43.911 --> 46:48.634
- What's your trade, mister?
- Mr. Tildon preaches the Good Lord's word.

46:53.355 --> 46:55.724
In that little church house?

46:55.824 --> 46:58.845
Yes, sir. When it's full.

47:02.797 --> 47:05.867
We gonna run into
any funny business in the morning?

47:05.967 --> 47:08.036
People walking about?

47:08.570 --> 47:11.672
No, sir. Town's a few miles in.

47:11.772 --> 47:14.376
We ain't had... nobody at morning service,

47:14.476 --> 47:17.531
or any other service for months now.

47:18.413 --> 47:22.503
Like I says, town's got the consumption,
everyone's shut in.

47:23.618 --> 47:25.888
I'm gonna get some shuteye,

47:25.988 --> 47:29.309
get myself a nice rubdown. I'm sore deep.

47:31.126 --> 47:33.614
You know how, little bug?

47:33.996 --> 47:36.854
Sir, may I say my piece?

47:42.103 --> 47:44.324
Much obliged.

47:45.107 --> 47:49.144
I wanted to plead with you
one last time, man to man,

47:49.244 --> 47:52.646
please leave my little Flo's purity
for her husband,

47:52.746 --> 47:55.394
- whomever that may be.
- Please just be a good boy.

47:55.494 --> 47:59.305
- I ain't no boy.
- Let me handle this.

48:01.589 --> 48:04.259
Your daughters give you rubdowns,
I take it.

48:04.359 --> 48:07.630
Why, yes, sir. That's the frontier way.

48:07.730 --> 48:10.151
Daddy likes it when I do it best,
'cause my hands are strong.

48:10.251 --> 48:13.429
Yes, yes, honey. Just... quiet down.

48:14.369 --> 48:18.171
All I want's a rubdown, same as you.

48:18.271 --> 48:21.105
Nothing sinister. Nothing...

48:22.249 --> 48:24.063
sexual.

48:25.880 --> 48:29.084
This is a house of God.
We do not speak of such things.

48:29.554 --> 48:32.707
What kind of things? Sexual things?

48:36.273 --> 48:39.378
Joe, you keep outside watch tonight.

48:39.478 --> 48:41.932
Take the other girl with you.

48:45.434 --> 48:49.071
Daddy? Daddy! Daddy, stop him, Daddy!

48:49.171 --> 48:53.241
- He'll behave himself.
- Charlotte, Charlotte, you just go along.

48:53.341 --> 48:56.744
- Everything'll be fine.
- I'll try.

48:56.844 --> 48:59.514
Honey. Honey, look at me.

49:00.014 --> 49:01.850
I love you.

49:01.950 --> 49:04.394
I love you, Daddy.

49:05.120 --> 49:09.409
Joe, you behave yourself.
No funny business.

49:17.131 --> 49:19.620
Pony up, little bug.

49:27.109 --> 49:29.678
First light, we move.

49:30.278 --> 49:33.781
We're lucky if they ain't dead.
They didn't find no horses.

49:33.881 --> 49:37.719
You have to prepare
for a stretch like that to make it.

49:38.319 --> 49:41.356
Well, maybe they was prepared.

49:41.456 --> 49:45.393
I doubt it.
They're bank robbers, not trackers.

49:45.493 --> 49:49.497
I doubt it, too, but... they're gonna
come across some horses soon.

49:49.597 --> 49:53.301
And if they're still kicking,
they might kill for 'em.

49:53.801 --> 49:57.571
I don't think it's smart,
us going in only two like this.

49:57.671 --> 50:00.641
With surprise, we'll get the bulge on 'em.

50:00.741 --> 50:04.980
When we get to Mesilla,
I plan to picking up some more muscle.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.333
That'll help.

50:10.885 --> 50:13.522
Honest, I don't miss the boys.

50:13.622 --> 50:17.711
Their water's been more use than
they'd have been crossing this stretch.

50:20.394 --> 50:22.283
Yeah.

51:44.478 --> 51:46.383
Get up.

52:38.732 --> 52:40.335
Alright.

52:41.488 --> 52:43.561
Come on.

52:44.272 --> 52:46.775
You have the oils?

52:46.875 --> 52:49.328
We use chicken fat.

52:52.045 --> 52:54.566
We'll do it dry.

52:59.587 --> 53:02.041
Well, now take it up.

53:06.361 --> 53:08.882
Get positioned proper, honey.

53:45.899 --> 53:47.736
Shit.

53:48.136 --> 53:51.991
- What the dickens got into you, little bug?
- I'm sorry.

53:53.475 --> 53:55.695
Son of a bitch.

53:58.246 --> 54:00.500
I should've asked.

54:04.586 --> 54:06.457
Girl...

54:06.557 --> 54:08.489
even if I'm...

54:08.589 --> 54:10.325
belly fired,

54:10.425 --> 54:12.878
I ain't partial to that.

54:16.730 --> 54:18.820
I'm sorry.

54:27.676 --> 54:29.563
Shit.

54:37.885 --> 54:39.920
What are you doin'?

54:40.020 --> 54:41.855
What's wrong?

54:41.955 --> 54:44.544
Am I not doin' it proper?

54:54.768 --> 54:57.857
I ain't opposed to relations with you.

55:00.909 --> 55:03.229
As a matter of fact...

55:07.115 --> 55:10.303
I have a fire in my belly right now.

55:12.386 --> 55:14.974
But this ain't the way I want it.

55:16.190 --> 55:18.678
I wanna bed you proper.

55:21.662 --> 55:24.366
But you're here acting more like...

55:24.466 --> 55:27.102
an adventuress than a lady.

55:27.402 --> 55:29.890
You been with one of them?

55:32.106 --> 55:35.495
Been with a couple in my day, I reckon.

55:37.511 --> 55:39.847
But you gotta remember, I'm old.

55:39.947 --> 55:42.250
You're not old.

55:42.950 --> 55:45.304
For a lawbreaker...

55:45.819 --> 55:47.873
I'm ancient.

55:49.857 --> 55:52.560
What was it like with the painted ladies?

55:52.660 --> 55:55.015
Did they do it good?

55:58.065 --> 56:00.553
They have their own way.

56:04.906 --> 56:07.994
But if I wanted those kind of relations...

56:08.709 --> 56:11.230
I could have 'em any time I want.

56:15.083 --> 56:17.838
Now, what got into you, little bug...

56:18.353 --> 56:20.958
make you do a thing like that?

56:26.093 --> 56:29.348
Youse likes to talks about anything?

56:34.636 --> 56:36.490
Alright.

56:38.872 --> 56:42.596
Youse real lucky Henry called me off...

56:43.411 --> 56:46.499
or I'd be fucking you silly right now.

01:01:26.793 --> 01:01:29.148
Where'd that come from?

01:01:31.865 --> 01:01:33.752
Knife.

01:01:35.468 --> 01:01:37.890
Where'd those come from?

01:01:44.244 --> 01:01:46.581
I think you know.

01:01:46.681 --> 01:01:49.102
I suppose I do.

01:01:49.783 --> 01:01:52.004
Did it hurt?

01:01:52.686 --> 01:01:54.973
Every time.

01:01:56.957 --> 01:01:59.726
Better than not hurting, though.

01:01:59.826 --> 01:02:02.381
That means it's all over.

01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:06.319
I never met a man like you.

01:02:07.801 --> 01:02:10.637
I reckon you ain't met many men.

01:02:10.737 --> 01:02:13.140
Not many, but some.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.395
I thought they were all like my daddy.

01:02:19.914 --> 01:02:22.249
I was wrong.

01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:24.836
You are a good man.

01:02:28.222 --> 01:02:31.191
I ain't never been accused of such.

01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:33.778
Well, I'm accusing you.

01:02:40.334 --> 01:02:42.754
How's your riding legs?

01:02:43.471 --> 01:02:45.673
Better than most girls,

01:02:45.773 --> 01:02:48.543
worse than most boys, I suppose.

01:02:48.843 --> 01:02:52.098
- That'll do.
- I'm tough enough.

01:02:56.584 --> 01:02:59.405
You ever been down Mexico way?

01:03:00.487 --> 01:03:02.222
No.

01:03:02.322 --> 01:03:05.344
Mighty pretty in the right spots.

01:03:10.564 --> 01:03:12.385
Henry?

01:03:13.766 --> 01:03:15.987
Yes, darlin'.

01:03:17.972 --> 01:03:20.092
You fancy me?

01:03:23.977 --> 01:03:26.266
I reckon I do.

01:03:27.147 --> 01:03:30.718
I fancied you soon the moment
you walked through that door,

01:03:30.818 --> 01:03:33.539
even though I knew I shouldn't.

01:03:34.722 --> 01:03:37.125
But it's different now.

01:03:37.625 --> 01:03:40.645
Now that I know you're a good man.

01:03:46.801 --> 01:03:48.636
Henry?

01:03:49.636 --> 01:03:51.956
Yes, darlin'.

01:03:53.641 --> 01:03:56.262
I never been kissed before.

01:04:45.259 --> 01:04:48.081
Damn near Apache country.

01:04:48.962 --> 01:04:51.399
Maybe they got 'em already.

01:04:51.499 --> 01:04:53.301
Maybe.

01:04:53.401 --> 01:04:55.336
I doubt it, though.

01:04:55.436 --> 01:05:00.059
That stretch would've got 'em
before the Apache did.

01:05:03.911 --> 01:05:06.113
I just wanna collect 'em.

01:05:06.213 --> 01:05:09.091
I don't care if they're dead already
or alive as June Wiggles,

01:05:09.191 --> 01:05:11.686
I just wanna collect 'em.

01:05:12.086 --> 01:05:13.888
Josiah.

01:05:14.288 --> 01:05:16.823
It's okay to lose out once.

01:05:16.923 --> 01:05:19.193
Hell, we're done flush already.

01:05:19.293 --> 01:05:21.929
Nobody's gonna hold it against us.

01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:26.334
No, it ain't,
and that ain't what it's about.

01:05:26.434 --> 01:05:28.503
You oughta think about
shutting your cock-holster,

01:05:28.603 --> 01:05:31.956
'less you wind up
like old yellow man over there.

01:05:32.806 --> 01:05:34.807
You back down, Josiah.

01:05:34.907 --> 01:05:37.463
I'm not one of your whores.

01:05:38.045 --> 01:05:41.081
I won't quit until you do.
I'm just saying.

01:05:41.181 --> 01:05:43.602
Yeah, just sayin'.

01:05:44.518 --> 01:05:47.407
Let's light a shuck. Come on.

01:06:13.881 --> 01:06:16.368
Take a sit on your seat.

01:06:36.469 --> 01:06:38.758
Alright now.

01:06:40.341 --> 01:06:42.243
We all clear?

01:06:42.343 --> 01:06:44.563
We's good.

01:06:46.012 --> 01:06:48.501
Time to hightail it.

01:06:49.682 --> 01:06:52.586
I knew that bastard'd keep
the woman the whole damn night.

01:06:52.686 --> 01:06:57.023
Well, if my knob was slimy with done
cunny, I'd have stayed in there too.

01:06:57.123 --> 01:07:00.531
Wake it up now, Henry.
Time to light a shuck!

01:07:03.263 --> 01:07:05.165
Dammit, come on.

01:07:05.265 --> 01:07:09.235
Already late. Don't wanna tempt fate.

01:07:09.435 --> 01:07:11.739
Them's rhymin' words, Charlie!

01:07:11.839 --> 01:07:14.227
Well, ain't you smart.

01:07:32.725 --> 01:07:35.863
Take a settle... knuckleheads.

01:07:36.063 --> 01:07:38.517
What the fuck is this?

01:07:40.567 --> 01:07:44.005
- What do you think?
- Who's she think she is, Calamity Jane?

01:07:44.105 --> 01:07:46.039
Well...

01:07:46.139 --> 01:07:48.541
this here's the new member of our gang.

01:07:48.641 --> 01:07:50.976
What's gotten into you, Sissy?

01:07:51.076 --> 01:07:53.927
- You got rocks in your noggin, Henry?
- I'd mind your tone.

01:07:54.027 --> 01:07:57.518
I'll mind my tone just fine, but I'm worried
about you givin' fire to this girl.

01:07:57.618 --> 01:08:00.604
- You don't know her.
- I'd mind your tone a little more.

01:08:00.704 --> 01:08:04.623
- That's my wife-to-be.
- Wife-to-be?

01:08:04.723 --> 01:08:08.362
- Ain't nobody gonna say nothing?
- Ain't nothing nobody can say, missy.

01:08:08.462 --> 01:08:12.320
First church we find across the border,
we're gonna stop and do it proper,

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.919
ain't we now, Henry?

01:08:15.636 --> 01:08:18.658
Why, yes, we is, little bug.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:22.728
That way, I'm keeping my promise, old man.

01:08:23.377 --> 01:08:25.742
- Save her for her husband.
- Charlotte.

01:08:26.312 --> 01:08:31.203
No, no, honey, I done got my nose
boogered, but my legs are just fine.

01:08:36.238 --> 01:08:41.031
Flo, you're upsetting your mama.
Why don't you come on back to earth now?

01:08:43.731 --> 01:08:46.733
I'm already right here on earth, Papa.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:49.069
Henry and I are going off together.

01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:52.237
Please, sir. I beg you.

01:08:52.437 --> 01:08:54.826
In the name of the Good Christ.
She's just a baby.

01:08:54.926 --> 01:08:58.060
She don't know what she's doin'.
Now I can tell...

01:08:58.161 --> 01:09:00.250
that you are a good man.

01:09:05.535 --> 01:09:08.055
Just like your husband?

01:09:10.224 --> 01:09:12.258
Yes, sir.

01:09:12.358 --> 01:09:16.296
Now, I know you don't wanna lead her
to the fire when she's just a young'un.

01:09:16.397 --> 01:09:19.133
She deserves a chance
to lead a righteous life.

01:09:19.233 --> 01:09:22.621
You shut it, Mama.
I've had about enough of you.

01:09:24.371 --> 01:09:26.872
Honey, I love you.

01:09:26.973 --> 01:09:31.578
- You're my little baby!
- Honey, my sweetest, darling little girl.

01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:36.316
I know you're just making a mash to
save us, but this here's a fair man.

01:09:36.416 --> 01:09:39.986
He got no need to bed us down.
He would've done it already.

01:09:40.086 --> 01:09:42.942
Henry, we gots to cut stick.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:47.060
Flo... you just tell this man...

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:50.296
that you love your family
and that we need you.

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:52.569
You tell him you can't go.

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:56.188
- Yes.
- I see here a man that...

01:09:56.969 --> 01:09:59.107
he wants to make his way
away from the fire.

01:09:59.207 --> 01:10:03.110
I see a man that wants
to lead the righteous way.

01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:06.297
- Yes.
- I see a man here that might...

01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:11.953
Sissy, why you playing
such devilish games?

01:10:12.053 --> 01:10:15.740
- I ain't playin'.
- Well, hell!

01:10:16.623 --> 01:10:19.075
Ain't she a firecracker.

01:10:19.625 --> 01:10:23.830
Honey... why you wanna point
a gun at your daddy?

01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:28.219
What I ought to do is open a crater
in your face with this here pistol.

01:10:28.319 --> 01:10:30.603
What you think about that, Papa?

01:10:30.703 --> 01:10:35.242
Well... it sounds to me
like he done bamboozled you...

01:10:35.792 --> 01:10:37.328
turned you against your own pa.

01:10:37.428 --> 01:10:39.714
Sissy, that's just about enough!
Now, you leave Daddy alone!

01:10:39.814 --> 01:10:42.442
Be a good girl, honey,
put the gun down. Just remember...

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:47.257
that the good Lord is testing us.
We can still serve him, honey,

01:10:47.357 --> 01:10:51.525
- and make everything better.
- Honey, we got to stick together as a family.

01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:54.146
- Yes.
- Alright.

01:10:57.697 --> 01:10:59.919
That's enough.

01:11:08.075 --> 01:11:10.663
You wanna do this right, sweets.

01:11:20.554 --> 01:11:22.841
Sit down.

01:11:28.962 --> 01:11:30.497
Fresh?

01:11:30.597 --> 01:11:32.600
Hold on.

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:35.167
We got 'em, alright.

01:11:35.267 --> 01:11:38.405
They're on foot, headed to Mesilla,
and this boy here...

01:11:38.505 --> 01:11:41.375
he's bleeding like a wag tail on the rag.

01:11:41.475 --> 01:11:44.877
I wouldn't be surprised
if we come up on another stiff.

01:11:44.977 --> 01:11:46.812
Which way?

01:11:46.912 --> 01:11:49.233
Well, from here in...

01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:52.820
there's only one way that men can trek.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:58.309
By the looks of this, they ain't
but two hops and a holler away.

01:11:59.192 --> 01:12:03.833
- Do we ride?
- Hell, yes. Let's cut stick.

01:12:07.267 --> 01:12:10.571
- Can I sit with my family, sir?
- I ain't gonna tell you twice.

01:12:10.671 --> 01:12:13.926
Sit... down.

01:12:20.246 --> 01:12:23.369
You too, missy, other side of the table.

01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:32.593
Henry, what the hell's going on here?

01:12:32.693 --> 01:12:34.762
- We need to cut stick.
- It'll just take a few minutes.

01:12:34.862 --> 01:12:37.073
But it ain't arguable.

01:12:37.778 --> 01:12:40.173
Best grab a chair.

01:12:40.933 --> 01:12:42.570
What in the Good Christ's name is being...

01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:46.225
You shut your fucking mouth
till I tell you different!

01:12:47.373 --> 01:12:49.594
Hey, bug...

01:12:50.743 --> 01:12:53.832
the things we talked about,
what do you wanna do first?

01:12:54.482 --> 01:12:58.387
First thing... or the second thing?

01:12:59.886 --> 01:13:02.173
The second thing.

01:13:03.824 --> 01:13:06.111
Alright, then.

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.981
Makes sense.

01:13:11.298 --> 01:13:13.385
Have at it.

01:13:16.304 --> 01:13:18.139
No!

01:13:19.339 --> 01:13:22.493
Sit down! She ain't fucking around.

01:13:22.593 --> 01:13:24.810
No, she ain't!

01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:26.648
Charlotte!

01:13:40.493 --> 01:13:44.411
I'm sorry, Sissy.
I meant to hit you up higher.

01:13:47.601 --> 01:13:50.543
Move it, Mama,
'less you wanna get sprayed.

01:14:03.282 --> 01:14:05.137
Bug.

01:14:13.961 --> 01:14:17.329
We're all damned to eternal burning.

01:14:17.429 --> 01:14:20.767
All of us, all of us. All damned.

01:14:20.867 --> 01:14:25.366
And the devil that deceived us was thrown
into the lake of fire and brimstone,

01:14:25.466 --> 01:14:28.876
- where the beast...
- Shut up, woman!

01:14:29.676 --> 01:14:33.137
- ...into the lake of fire and brimstone...
- Take a settle now, woman!

01:14:33.587 --> 01:14:36.635
- Shut your fucking yammer box.
- Shut!

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.488
God!

01:14:49.029 --> 01:14:51.798
What you've done is unforgivable!

01:14:52.198 --> 01:14:54.401
The devil's in you now!

01:14:54.501 --> 01:14:58.090
There ain't nothing can keep
your soul outta the fires.

01:14:58.604 --> 01:15:02.091
Ain't nothing more demonic than
striking down your own flesh and blood,

01:15:02.191 --> 01:15:05.196
- your own kin!
- Shut it, mister.

01:15:09.982 --> 01:15:14.472
I'd like to exchange words now,
man to man.

01:15:17.757 --> 01:15:20.093
Take off your vest.

01:15:20.193 --> 01:15:22.329
- Pardon?
- You do as you're told.

01:15:22.429 --> 01:15:24.883
Take off your vest.

01:15:34.874 --> 01:15:37.696
Get that thing outta here, will you?

01:15:39.612 --> 01:15:41.699
Backdoor.

01:16:16.283 --> 01:16:19.038
You look at me when I talk to you.

01:16:19.953 --> 01:16:23.856
Yes, sir. I'm ready to talk.

01:16:24.181 --> 01:16:26.792
Now don't be a lickfinger.

01:16:26.892 --> 01:16:30.215
I wasn't licking no finger... sir.

01:16:32.365 --> 01:16:37.371
Why don't you tell me how it is your
oldest daughter got all twisted up inside.

01:16:37.471 --> 01:16:40.493
Why she couldn't be in the family way.

01:16:43.043 --> 01:16:45.464
I told you that already.

01:16:46.013 --> 01:16:48.314
She got the fever.

01:16:48.414 --> 01:16:50.768
You sure about that?

01:16:52.152 --> 01:16:54.773
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.

01:17:00.259 --> 01:17:02.128
Now...

01:17:02.728 --> 01:17:05.132
you have two choices, you son of a bitch.

01:17:05.232 --> 01:17:07.786
Humiliation or death.

01:17:08.768 --> 01:17:12.471
Now, you either speak truth...

01:17:12.871 --> 01:17:15.359
or I'll pull the trigger.

01:17:17.811 --> 01:17:19.698
Well?

01:17:22.349 --> 01:17:24.769
She was pregnant.

01:17:25.185 --> 01:17:27.006
What?

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:33.359
- She was in the family way.
- When? When was she in the family way?

01:17:33.459 --> 01:17:36.480
- Please, sir, don't make me...
- You say it!

01:17:37.998 --> 01:17:41.467
I was sick.
I was sick with the devil's seed!

01:17:41.567 --> 01:17:44.122
I was sick with the drink!

01:17:44.471 --> 01:17:46.773
- There was a demon living here with us!
- How old?

01:17:46.873 --> 01:17:48.408
A demon!

01:17:48.508 --> 01:17:51.445
God have mercy on us all.

01:17:51.545 --> 01:17:54.032
How old was she, mister?

01:17:55.781 --> 01:17:57.601
Eleven.

01:18:05.492 --> 01:18:09.348
Eleven... years old.

01:18:13.899 --> 01:18:16.654
And I speak the truth when...

01:18:17.703 --> 01:18:22.771
when I say digging that baby out of her
is what twisted her all up inside.

01:18:25.144 --> 01:18:27.431
You look at me.

01:18:29.314 --> 01:18:31.885
Who put her in the family way?

01:18:31.985 --> 01:18:34.973
Who planted that filthy seed?

01:18:37.624 --> 01:18:41.294
That was the devil's work.
That was the drink.

01:18:41.903 --> 01:18:45.666
You... you frontier folk is wrong,
if there ever was such a word.

01:18:45.766 --> 01:18:50.455
- The devil's work? The drink?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

01:18:51.238 --> 01:18:53.406
And I guess that you...

01:18:53.506 --> 01:18:56.777
you just... done fixed that, right?

01:18:56.877 --> 01:19:00.163
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah? Long time ago?

01:19:01.782 --> 01:19:04.083
Yes, sir. I...

01:19:05.204 --> 01:19:07.320
We brought Jesus back into our home.

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:11.254
I quit the drink. We drove the demon out.

01:19:14.027 --> 01:19:16.596
So now the demon's clean gone?

01:19:17.096 --> 01:19:18.998
And you repent?

01:19:19.098 --> 01:19:22.286
So all's good, you know? Good with God?

01:19:23.002 --> 01:19:26.571
Yes, sir. Christ forgives.

01:19:26.771 --> 01:19:28.040
He forgives.

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.543
Well, yes, he does, mister.

01:19:30.643 --> 01:19:34.598
Well, yes, he does!

01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:39.603
So I have one more question.

01:19:40.954 --> 01:19:44.276
If the... the devil...

01:19:45.358 --> 01:19:48.147
if he's gone from this house...

01:19:50.697 --> 01:19:53.418
well, then, that must've been you...

01:19:54.201 --> 01:19:56.670
getting your dirty ass licked...

01:19:56.770 --> 01:20:02.175
and your tiny prick slopped on
by my bride-to-be last week,

01:20:02.275 --> 01:20:05.611
and the week before that
and the week before that!

01:20:05.711 --> 01:20:08.065
Hey, you shush!

01:20:09.982 --> 01:20:12.217
I might just pump you full of lead

01:20:12.317 --> 01:20:15.722
on account of you knowin'
it was goin' on all these years.

01:20:16.518 --> 01:20:18.809
Yeah, that's right.

01:20:29.803 --> 01:20:32.024
You see...

01:20:39.745 --> 01:20:41.999
Here's the thing.

01:20:51.624 --> 01:20:53.878
You see...

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.929
Christ forgives.

01:20:57.029 --> 01:20:59.150
He does.

01:21:01.134 --> 01:21:03.355
But I don't.

01:21:07.373 --> 01:21:09.176
Hey!

01:21:09.376 --> 01:21:10.644
Joe.

01:21:10.744 --> 01:21:12.145
- Yes, sir.
- Here you are, old boy.

01:21:12.245 --> 01:21:14.715
I need you to do something for me.

01:21:14.815 --> 01:21:17.628
I need you to fuck this man proper,
right there in that shit hole.

01:21:17.728 --> 01:21:20.621
- What did you fuckin' say?
- Please don't!

01:21:20.721 --> 01:21:23.489
- Keep your heads down!
- What did you fuckin' say?

01:21:23.589 --> 01:21:26.794
Charlie, you mind the ladies
for me, will ya?

01:21:26.894 --> 01:21:29.261
Take 'em outside a spell.

01:21:29.661 --> 01:21:31.815
My pleasure.

01:21:35.401 --> 01:21:39.157
I don't need to put eyes
on this sick shit.

01:21:42.342 --> 01:21:46.880
I don't know about this, boss.
I ain't never done nothin' like it.

01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:51.051
You'll be fine as cream gravy.
Now whip out that knob, boy.

01:21:52.618 --> 01:21:56.390
You so much as move a muscle, I'm gonna
put two bullets in the back of your head

01:21:56.490 --> 01:21:59.745
before you can say eat my asshole.

01:22:04.496 --> 01:22:08.134
- Okay.
- Where's that chicken fat?

01:22:09.334 --> 01:22:11.623
We're all out!

01:22:12.839 --> 01:22:14.674
Shame.

01:22:15.174 --> 01:22:17.795
Looks like Joe's going in dry.

01:22:18.495 --> 01:22:22.267
Henry... I don't like some man ass.

01:22:23.583 --> 01:22:25.652
You put it in the back
of a woman, I reckon.

01:22:25.752 --> 01:22:29.557
Yes, sir, once or twice,
with the old ladies at Miss Rita's.

01:22:29.657 --> 01:22:32.559
There you go. Alright.

01:22:32.659 --> 01:22:37.181
Now you just close your eyes
and you imagine it's that...

01:22:37.697 --> 01:22:40.067
nice lady's ass.

01:22:41.467 --> 01:22:44.422
Alright, I reckons I can do that.

01:22:45.537 --> 01:22:47.791
Alright, then.

01:22:53.478 --> 01:22:55.799
You stay right there.

01:23:07.527 --> 01:23:09.747
Hey, mister.

01:23:10.063 --> 01:23:12.298
You ready?

01:23:12.998 --> 01:23:15.591
- No!
- Alright, go.

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:20.307
Now you hit him nice and hard.
Make sure he knows it's in him.

01:23:20.507 --> 01:23:23.810
I ain't worked up, Henry.
I gots to get it ready.

01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:26.512
Alright. That's fine.

01:23:26.612 --> 01:23:30.367
And you... take your time.

01:23:31.784 --> 01:23:34.138
You stay comfortable.

01:23:52.368 --> 01:23:54.240
You shush.

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:56.608
You know...

01:23:57.008 --> 01:23:59.963
usually I'd wait till after.

01:24:00.747 --> 01:24:03.167
But this is too good.

01:24:05.717 --> 01:24:08.138
Ain't I the matchmaker?

01:24:10.622 --> 01:24:14.226
All set. It's ready, Henry.

01:24:14.326 --> 01:24:16.127
Alright, old boy,

01:24:16.227 --> 01:24:19.965
now you shove it in there nice and deep.

01:24:20.065 --> 01:24:23.008
No! Please! Please! Just shoot me!

01:24:23.108 --> 01:24:26.004
Please! Please! Shoot me!

01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:30.577
Stop! Stop. Joe, stop.

01:24:30.977 --> 01:24:32.679
You done good, boy.

01:24:32.779 --> 01:24:36.648
- I don't gotta gets it in, Henry?
- No. No, you don't.

01:24:37.048 --> 01:24:39.552
I just wanted to scare him, is all.

01:24:39.652 --> 01:24:42.487
Now put that thing back
in your riding pants.

01:24:42.587 --> 01:24:44.572
Thank you!

01:24:44.672 --> 01:24:47.092
Thank you from the bottom of my gullet!

01:24:47.192 --> 01:24:48.861
Hey, Joe...

01:24:48.961 --> 01:24:51.215
fetch Florence.

01:24:53.532 --> 01:24:55.335
And you...

01:24:55.435 --> 01:24:58.870
get your ass up off the table
and sit down.

01:25:00.057 --> 01:25:02.374
You not gonna kill me?

01:25:03.074 --> 01:25:07.879
Thank you, sir! Thank you. Thank you.

01:25:07.979 --> 01:25:11.884
I'm gonna clean the devil out...
proper this time.

01:25:11.984 --> 01:25:14.339
How you doin', little bug?

01:25:15.721 --> 01:25:18.310
You think about what you wanna use?

01:25:19.792 --> 01:25:22.079
Alright, then.

01:25:30.637 --> 01:25:33.124
I reckon this'll do.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.260
She gonna shoot me?

01:25:37.476 --> 01:25:40.431
No, no, no, Nancy pants.

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.216
You see... she wanted to at first.

01:25:44.316 --> 01:25:49.306
Then I told her, y'know,
gunshot's quick, it's easy.

01:25:49.821 --> 01:25:52.309
Gunshot's a good death.

01:25:53.859 --> 01:25:56.313
You deserve to feel it.

01:26:13.946 --> 01:26:16.415
Holy hell, girl!

01:26:16.615 --> 01:26:18.851
You still have doubts
about our new member?

01:26:18.951 --> 01:26:21.173
Hell no!

01:26:29.361 --> 01:26:31.683
You okay, honey?

01:26:31.898 --> 01:26:34.065
You alright?

01:26:34.165 --> 01:26:35.568
Water.

01:26:35.668 --> 01:26:38.490
Hey, Joe, grab some water, will you?

01:26:42.207 --> 01:26:44.010
Alright?

01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:46.197
I'm sorry.

01:26:46.778 --> 01:26:49.115
For what, little bug?

01:26:49.215 --> 01:26:52.835
You done mighty fine. Thanks, Joe.

01:27:00.426 --> 01:27:02.561
I never seen anything like that.

01:27:02.661 --> 01:27:06.465
I suppose the look of it
just... turned my stomach.

01:27:06.565 --> 01:27:08.619
It's normal.

01:27:10.736 --> 01:27:14.625
You done real good. Real good.

01:27:17.909 --> 01:27:20.447
No. No.

01:27:22.547 --> 01:27:25.869
- I wanna finish it.
- Ma'am...

01:27:26.653 --> 01:27:29.073
can I indulge?

01:27:30.956 --> 01:27:33.011
Alright.

01:27:37.562 --> 01:27:39.765
Now, don't take this the wrong way,

01:27:39.865 --> 01:27:42.469
but there are better ways to finish.

01:27:42.569 --> 01:27:45.674
Now, you cracked him mighty hard, but...

01:27:46.004 --> 01:27:47.940
he's still alive.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.177
I thought he'd be dead
after I broke his eye like that.

01:27:51.277 --> 01:27:53.513
Yeah, you'd think so?

01:27:53.613 --> 01:27:58.218
But it don't always work that easy.
You gotta hit in the proper place.

01:27:58.318 --> 01:28:02.386
Now... do you want to finish him now...

01:28:02.886 --> 01:28:05.624
or you wanna make him suffer
a little bit more?

01:28:05.724 --> 01:28:07.759
Not much more.

01:28:07.859 --> 01:28:11.249
Alrighty. Lookie here.

01:28:11.663 --> 01:28:15.267
You hit him here, he dies immediate-like.

01:28:15.367 --> 01:28:17.937
You hits him right here, right here,

01:28:18.037 --> 01:28:20.870
just make him squeal like a pig.

01:28:21.673 --> 01:28:26.387
- A thousand thanks, sir.
- Call me Charlie. We're friends now.

01:28:31.182 --> 01:28:33.503
Finish him, darlin'.

01:30:00.471 --> 01:30:03.408
Now that's a show if I ever seens one.

01:30:03.508 --> 01:30:05.796
Quiet, old boy.

01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:10.668
Alright.

01:30:11.417 --> 01:30:13.653
Let's get you cleaned up.

01:30:13.753 --> 01:30:16.955
- Missy?
- Yes, Charlie?

01:30:17.055 --> 01:30:19.771
Why'd you bed down your sis?

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.988
She liked it.

01:30:35.507 --> 01:30:37.310
<i>Violence...</i>

01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:39.945
<i>how does it all begin?</i>

01:30:40.045 --> 01:30:42.332
<i>The violence.</i>

01:30:42.448 --> 01:30:45.584
<i>We're either on one side of it
or the other.</i>

01:30:45.684 --> 01:30:48.019
<i>Sometimes both.</i>

01:30:48.119 --> 01:30:50.623
<i>Where's the innocence go?</i>

01:30:50.723 --> 01:30:52.525
<i>Is it gone?</i>

01:30:52.625 --> 01:30:55.995
<i>Or is it always there
beneath the darkness?</i>

01:30:56.195 --> 01:30:59.431
<i>Trying to remind us who we are.</i>

01:30:59.531 --> 01:31:02.067
<i>How do we lose ourselves?</i>

01:31:02.167 --> 01:31:05.405
<i>Or we find in our true selves?</i>

01:31:05.805 --> 01:31:08.707
<i>The innocence or the darkness?</i>

01:31:08.807 --> 01:31:11.295
<i>Which are we?</i>

01:31:17.816 --> 01:31:20.505
You got some blood on your face.

01:31:41.573 --> 01:31:43.642
I'm leaving, Mama.

01:31:43.742 --> 01:31:45.912
I was gonna kill you.

01:31:46.012 --> 01:31:47.780
- Why...
- Stubborn.

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:52.603
- Why would you kill...
- Shut your yap, I beg.

01:31:53.752 --> 01:31:57.790
I was going to kill you,
but Henry convinced me not to.

01:31:57.890 --> 01:32:00.292
He said he didn't wanna
spill no more blood,

01:32:00.392 --> 01:32:03.214
didn't want me getting too used to it.

01:32:07.099 --> 01:32:10.035
Now, I reckon there gonna be
bounty-hunters and lawmen here

01:32:10.135 --> 01:32:13.257
on account of that big reward
they're offering.

01:32:14.407 --> 01:32:17.394
You best keep your mouth shut, Mama.

01:32:18.611 --> 01:32:21.346
Remember, this is a gift Henry gave you.

01:32:21.446 --> 01:32:23.867
The gift of life.

01:32:31.723 --> 01:32:34.060
And also best remember...

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.228
that you will not know where I am...

01:32:37.328 --> 01:32:39.799
and I will know where you are.

01:32:39.899 --> 01:32:42.320
You understand?

01:32:42.635 --> 01:32:44.522
Yes.

01:32:47.639 --> 01:32:50.060
Henry told me to leave you that.

01:32:56.983 --> 01:32:59.237
I wish I...

01:33:00.553 --> 01:33:03.041
I would wish...

01:33:12.031 --> 01:33:14.352
I know, Mama.

01:35:45.051 --> 01:35:47.218
Those boys fucked a rooster.

01:35:47.318 --> 01:35:49.572
It's a mess.

01:35:50.722 --> 01:35:53.744
Let's take a look-see around the property.

01:37:33.359 --> 01:37:36.027
I need you to tell me everything.

01:37:36.127 --> 01:37:38.515
Where'd they go?

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.368
Woman!

01:37:51.477 --> 01:37:53.731
Where'd they go?

01:38:04.991 --> 01:38:07.727
Well... that's that.

01:38:07.827 --> 01:38:11.596
Did you wanna make a run?
You know I'm with you.

01:38:11.696 --> 01:38:15.352
The border's close
and they hours ahead of us.

01:38:16.902 --> 01:38:19.839
- We're beat.
- We're not beat.

01:38:19.939 --> 01:38:23.060
They just got our goat, just once.

01:38:24.909 --> 01:38:27.612
It's up to you. You're the boss.
We could stay.

01:38:27.712 --> 01:38:30.482
Or we could cross over
and we could look for 'em.

01:38:30.582 --> 01:38:33.853
No, I think you oughta
get on back to your family.

01:38:33.953 --> 01:38:37.688
And I'm gonna poke around
Mesilla a little bit,

01:38:37.788 --> 01:38:41.027
get a hot bath, you know,
kinda linger, see if I...

01:38:41.127 --> 01:38:44.061
Hey, hey, I'll stay.

01:38:44.161 --> 01:38:46.113
I know you will.

01:38:46.213 --> 01:38:48.881
I'm well-upped, though.

01:38:48.981 --> 01:38:53.185
You cut on out, get back to your family.

01:38:54.372 --> 01:38:56.794
You're the boss.

01:38:58.810 --> 01:39:02.533
- At least we got two of them.
- Yeah, we did.

01:39:25.637 --> 01:39:29.593
<i>Sometimes we decide
to take the wrong path.</i>

01:39:30.341 --> 01:39:32.945
<i>We think we're righteous.</i>

01:39:33.045 --> 01:39:35.846
<i>Surprise ourselves.</i>

01:39:35.946 --> 01:39:38.535
<i>We go toward the fire.</i>

01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:41.538
<i>Make the wrong choice.</i>

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.274
<i>And we're beat.</i>

01:41:23.554 --> 01:41:25.908
<i>It's all over.</i>

01:41:29.895 --> 01:41:32.248
<i>It's all over.</i>

01:43:35.187 --> 01:43:37.588
Open your eyes, little bug.

01:43:38.088 --> 01:43:39.942
Mexico.

01:43:40.591 --> 01:43:42.813
You and me.

01:43:43.261 --> 01:43:45.930
- You and me.
- Come on, love birds!

01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:49.886
Let's get a wiggle on!
We cross, then we rest easy!

01:43:54.004 --> 01:43:57.760
I'll never be able to show you
how grateful I am.

01:43:58.644 --> 01:44:02.448
You will. And I will.

01:44:03.048 --> 01:44:05.669
Got all the time in the world.

01:44:06.552 --> 01:44:08.439
No.

01:44:10.556 --> 01:44:12.443
Henry!

01:44:39.216 --> 01:44:41.038
Henry?

01:44:51.145 --> 01:44:53.533
I'm sorry, Henry.

01:44:54.098 --> 01:44:56.200
I wanted to, I really did.

01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:58.556
I just couldn't.

01:45:04.876 --> 01:45:07.265
That reward money is good, clean coin.

01:45:11.482 --> 01:45:13.370
Well...

01:45:14.885 --> 01:45:17.139
that's it.

01:52:43.468 --> 01:52:46.955
Didn't Daddy ever tell you
about revolvers?

01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:53.378
You always, no matter what,

01:52:53.478 --> 01:52:56.833
gotta leave one chamber empty.
You know why?

01:52:58.583 --> 01:53:00.903
You know why?

01:53:03.954 --> 01:53:09.044
It's 'cause if you're addle-handed and you
stack up all six and the gun drops...

01:53:09.761 --> 01:53:13.382
Then you've got yourself
in a real bad box.

01:53:18.301 --> 01:53:20.790
Hell, Henry told me...

01:53:21.671 --> 01:53:25.297
he knew a man who shot off his own ball.

01:53:27.511 --> 01:53:30.332
Never could have relations again.

01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:41.845
Poor thing.

01:53:43.028 --> 01:53:45.348
Are you alright, Mother?

01:53:46.063 --> 01:53:48.484
You look balled up.

01:53:54.838 --> 01:53:57.026
I know.

01:53:58.492 --> 01:54:00.613
I know.

01:54:02.981 --> 01:54:06.203
I reckon today's been a bag of nails.

01:54:08.653 --> 01:54:11.106
Lots of changes.

01:54:16.226 --> 01:54:18.680
Lots of changes.

01:59:28.404 --> 01:59:30.825
Mighty nice, Joe.

01:59:32.410 --> 01:59:34.631
Mighty nice.
