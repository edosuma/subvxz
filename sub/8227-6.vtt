WEBVTT

00:00.567 --> 00:01.900
The stuff we do is dangerous.

00:01.902 --> 00:03.035
Don't try this at home.

00:03.037 --> 00:05.871
We're
what you call experts.

00:05.873 --> 00:10.542
On this episode of
"Mythbusters"...

00:10.544 --> 00:14.046
...Adam and Jamie
go full throttle...

00:14.048 --> 00:17.716
...For the most dangerous stunt
in "Mythbusters" history...

00:17.718 --> 00:21.186
Did such an aggressive wheelie,
his head fell off.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.421
...Testing the viral video

00:22.423 --> 00:26.792
That a motorcycle could
surf the surface of a lake.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.394
I want to try it.

00:28.896 --> 00:31.463
But will it be man over bike?

00:31.465 --> 00:33.365
Could he
plant himself right here

00:33.367 --> 00:34.099
And just start flying?

00:34.101 --> 00:38.237
Or will Jamie torque on water?

00:39.139 --> 00:40.873
Meanwhile, kari, tory, and grant

00:40.875 --> 00:44.309
Get the drop on
a free-fall free-for-all...

00:44.311 --> 00:45.077
Oh!

00:45.079 --> 00:47.146
I don't even want to know
what the g's are on that.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.048
...Finding out if a criminal

00:49.050 --> 00:49.848
Could make a parachute

00:49.850 --> 00:53.419
Out of the paraphernalia
inside a hotel room.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.287
What is that,
the new fall fashion?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.388
Ah!

00:56.390 --> 00:58.724
But will their crazy canopies...

00:58.892 --> 01:00.025
Gonna be
a lot of wet floors

01:00.027 --> 01:01.193
With all these shower curtains
missing.

01:01.195 --> 01:05.096
...Let buster
skydive and survive?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.965
Come on.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.167
Open!

01:08.169 --> 01:10.135
Oh!

01:12.205 --> 01:15.007
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:15.542 --> 01:16.241
Adam savage...

01:16.243 --> 01:18.677
This is science in action.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.712
...And Jamie hyneman.

01:20.714 --> 01:21.180
Buh-bye.

01:21.182 --> 01:26.418
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.654
Together with grant imahara...

01:28.656 --> 01:30.055
That is crazy.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.790
...Kari byron...

01:31.792 --> 01:32.624
Aw!

01:32.626 --> 01:33.959
...And tory belleci.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.094
It's about to get real.

01:35.096 --> 01:38.597
They don't just tell
the myths.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.899
They put them to the test.

01:40.901 --> 01:44.036
... <font color="#ffff00">Captions by vitac</font> ...
<font color="#00ffff">www.vitac.com</font>

01:44.038 --> 01:48.107
Captions paid for by
discovery communications

01:53.079 --> 01:53.745
Jamie, you remember when

01:53.747 --> 01:55.080
Kari, grant, and tory
did the episode about

01:55.082 --> 01:57.916
A sports car
skipping across the lake?

01:57.918 --> 01:58.283
I do.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.919
50 miles an hour.

02:04.191 --> 02:05.624
That car didn't skip!

02:05.626 --> 02:06.158
It flipped!

02:06.160 --> 02:08.393
We got one similar to that
this time,

02:08.395 --> 02:09.695
Except this time,

02:09.697 --> 02:12.331
It's a motorcycle
riding on the water.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.968
A motorcycle actually
riding on top of water.

02:15.970 --> 02:16.502
Apparently.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.369
We got a motorcyclist,

02:17.371 --> 02:19.805
He's riding down the freeway
way too fast,

02:19.807 --> 02:20.472
He comes to a bend,

02:20.474 --> 02:22.774
And when he comes to the bend,
he can't make it.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.377
So he plows right through it,
and there is a lake,

02:25.379 --> 02:27.446
Except that
he stays on top of the lake

02:27.448 --> 02:29.715
And makes it
safely to the other side.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.717
Sounds dangerous and fun.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.253
I'm in.
Excellent.

02:35.355 --> 02:35.988
I can't stop it.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.689
Motorbikes and water

02:37.691 --> 02:41.093
Seem like
a catastrophic combination.

02:42.428 --> 02:43.896
Yet, according to this myth,

02:43.898 --> 02:46.231
If you take the lake
at freeway speeds,

02:46.233 --> 02:50.636
You could burn aqua
all the way to the other side.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.138
But will
this physics-defying feat

02:53.140 --> 02:55.574
Prove more sink than skim?

02:56.076 --> 02:58.243
Clearly,
this episode ends with

02:58.245 --> 03:00.746
One of us...
I'm guessing it's you ...

03:00.748 --> 03:02.581
Riding a big, powerful
motorcycle

03:02.583 --> 03:05.417
And attempting to
keep it on top of the water.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.185
Yeah, but I don't think

03:06.187 --> 03:07.753
We should just
jump right into this,

03:07.755 --> 03:11.156
Because it involves
high speed, crashes,

03:11.158 --> 03:13.258
Drowning, broken bones.

03:13.260 --> 03:13.792
It's risky.

03:13.794 --> 03:14.660
All right, well,
they do make

03:14.662 --> 03:16.695
Some very powerful
r.C. Motorcycles.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.730
What say we take one of those
out into the field,

03:18.732 --> 03:20.132
Ride them
over a small body of water,

03:20.134 --> 03:23.001
And see what we can learn
on the high-speed camera.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.703
Sure, why not.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.577
Now, we're not gonna be going
stampeding towards full scale

03:31.579 --> 03:32.844
Right away in this story.

03:32.846 --> 03:36.882
We've come to a, basically,
off-road motorcycle park

03:36.884 --> 03:39.785
Not far the "Mythbusters" shop,
and we're gonna be doing

03:39.787 --> 03:42.921
A little bit of experimenting
with these.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.424
These are the little
radio-controlled motorcycles,

03:45.426 --> 03:48.794
And they happen to have
a gyroscope in the rear wheel

03:48.796 --> 03:50.529
To help them stabilize
as they go.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.765
The top speed on them
is about 20 miles an hour.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.835
What that'll do in water,
I have no idea,

03:56.837 --> 03:59.471
But that's what
we're here to find out.

04:01.308 --> 04:04.977
Well, our scale bikes
require a scale pool,

04:04.979 --> 04:06.411
And that's just what this is.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.513
With a nice, gentle transition
over there,

04:08.515 --> 04:09.648
It's only
a couple of inches deep,

04:09.650 --> 04:10.949
And with the aid of
our high-speed camera,

04:10.951 --> 04:15.287
Hopefully, it will illuminate
some key things we need to know

04:15.289 --> 04:18.656
About whether or not bikes
can stay on top of the water.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.360
And with the h20 ready to go,

04:21.362 --> 04:23.962
It's time for
the wheels to meet the water.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.230
Here we go.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.499
Oh!

04:28.902 --> 04:29.768
Oh!

04:31.938 --> 04:33.472
Nice!

04:35.808 --> 04:38.243
Mr. Hyneman delivers.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.578
No riding a bike through water.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.179
He <i>wheelies</i> through water.

04:41.181 --> 04:43.982
It's not quite the "wheel" deal,

04:43.984 --> 04:48.020
As this myth is about
skimming on <i>two</i> wheels, not one.

04:48.022 --> 04:51.456
But luckily,
they don't have long to wait.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.959
Yeah, this is it.

04:53.961 --> 04:54.426
Whoo!

04:54.428 --> 04:57.896
As the hyneman
masters the two-wheel maneuver.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.698
Yeah!

04:59.700 --> 05:00.866
Whoo!

05:01.969 --> 05:04.236
And four triumphant trips later,

05:04.238 --> 05:06.838
It's time to see if
the bike's riding

05:06.840 --> 05:09.474
The top of the pond
or the bottom,

05:09.476 --> 05:11.276
Thanks to the high-speed review.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.346
Let us
see what we can learn.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.647
Wow.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.083
Sort of on the surface
right in the beginning

05:18.085 --> 05:20.719
'cause it's coming off of
that initial ramp.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.954
The rear wheel is down,
though.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.690
And it's
going down further.

05:24.692 --> 05:29.127
At this point, it's clear that
both wheels are down.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.562
It is definitely
deep in the water.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.098
It's almost deep enough
where I can say

05:33.100 --> 05:35.334
It really feels like
it's riding on the bottom.

05:35.336 --> 05:38.036
It's not
the news they were looking for.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.305
On each and every run,
their bike is

05:40.307 --> 05:43.875
Driving <i>through</i> the water
and not over it.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.279
And that means,
for this myth to stay afloat,

05:47.281 --> 05:52.217
Adam and Jamie are
going to need a plan "b."

05:54.520 --> 06:00.425
Next, kari, tory, and grant
shoot the breeze.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.561
All right, so,
this next one

06:02.563 --> 06:05.230
Sounds like
a hollywood action movie,

06:05.232 --> 06:07.599
But apparently,
it's totally legit.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.867
All right,
let's hear it.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.069
All right, so, wanted criminal,
surrounded by police,

06:11.071 --> 06:14.172
Tracked down to
the 20th floor of a hotel.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.874
After
a protracted negotiation,

06:15.876 --> 06:18.410
They break down the door,
and guess what they find?

06:18.412 --> 06:21.079
Money, jewels.

06:21.081 --> 06:21.413
Yes.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.515
But also
a homemade parachute.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.216
That one sounds familiar.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.917
The guy was stuck in
his hotel room for three hours,

06:25.919 --> 06:28.053
And he started
making a homemade parachute

06:28.055 --> 06:29.988
Out of
sheets and shower curtains,

06:29.990 --> 06:30.756
But he never made the jump

06:30.758 --> 06:33.892
Because the police broke in and
caught him before he could.

06:33.894 --> 06:34.493
So, he never jumped.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.795
We don't know if
the parachute actually works.

06:36.797 --> 06:37.262
Exactly.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.530
Can you make
a homemade parachute

06:38.532 --> 06:41.700
Out of things you can find
in a standard hotel room.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.268
Cool.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.004
Yep,
this audacious escape escapade

06:46.006 --> 06:48.874
Comes straight from
the criminal mind.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.442
Supposedly, this bad guy

06:50.444 --> 06:53.712
Was going to wing it
with a makeshift chute.

06:53.714 --> 06:54.379
But could he have

06:54.381 --> 06:56.481
Defeated gravity
for this getaway?

06:56.483 --> 06:59.384
Is there any way
an improvised parachute

06:59.386 --> 07:01.720
Could let you down safely?

07:01.722 --> 07:03.221
All right, guys,
how about this?

07:03.223 --> 07:03.722
We get all of

07:03.724 --> 07:04.956
The standard contents
from a hotel room.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.226
You know, drapes, sheets,
shower curtains, lamp cords.

07:08.228 --> 07:12.030
And then we have three hours
to build a parachute.

07:12.032 --> 07:12.664
Oh, that's great.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.932
We can connect
each of our chutes to buster

07:13.934 --> 07:16.268
And drop him from 20 stories,
just like in the myth.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.136
All right, well,
we better get crackin'.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.838
The police
are on their way.

07:21.141 --> 07:21.706
Where's he going?

07:21.708 --> 07:25.777
Yep. First, it's
a build-off, or "chute-out."

07:25.779 --> 07:28.213
We're working on the myth that
you can make a parachute

07:28.215 --> 07:30.849
Out of common things
you might find in a hotel room.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.717
Now, that gives us
so much material.

07:32.719 --> 07:35.020
We've got
the bedding on the beds,

07:35.022 --> 07:36.488
The curtains,
the blackout curtains,

07:36.490 --> 07:37.189
The rods, the strings,

07:37.191 --> 07:41.393
Any cords you can find from
lamps or tvs or ethernet cables,

07:41.395 --> 07:42.761
And the wealth
that is the bathroom.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.796
I mean, we have
shower curtains, towels ...

07:44.798 --> 07:46.097
Anything you can think of.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.066
Now, we have
three hours to do this,

07:48.068 --> 07:50.168
Because the burglar
only had three hours,

07:50.170 --> 07:52.237
To see which of us
can come up with

07:52.239 --> 07:54.105
The most successful parachute.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.974
And the clock starts now.

07:55.976 --> 08:00.712
So, the first decision is to
choose their weaving of choice.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.348
So, what I'm gonna use is
this blackout curtain.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.250
It's fabric coated by plastic.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.385
That's gonna
give me a lot of wind resistance

08:07.387 --> 08:09.654
And not only that ...
that plastic coating

08:09.656 --> 08:11.690
Is gonna give me more strength.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.891
Hopefully, this'll work.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.593
I'm starting out with
the lightest,

08:14.595 --> 08:16.595
Least-porous materials
that I could find,

08:16.597 --> 08:19.731
Which are the shower curtains,
the liners.

08:19.733 --> 08:20.565
I'm going to attach them

08:20.567 --> 08:22.634
And make them
the base of my parachute.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.036
I figure they'll
hold the air the best.

08:25.038 --> 08:25.804
What I'm doing is

08:25.806 --> 08:27.739
Using these curtain rods
to make a frame.

08:27.741 --> 08:31.610
And, then, from that, I'm gonna
drape this duvet cover over it.

08:31.612 --> 08:35.046
The reason I chose a duvet cover
as opposed to regular sheets is

08:35.048 --> 08:36.313
I didn't want to sew any seams.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.450
I think
if I have any seams on there,

08:38.452 --> 08:40.751
It's going to be not as strong.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.087
Indeed,
because strength is vital,

08:43.090 --> 08:46.491
Considering what their
improvised chutes have to mimic.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.093
Now, the way a parachute works

08:48.095 --> 08:50.695
Is by increasing the
surface area of a falling object

08:50.697 --> 08:53.598
So that way,
it has more contact with air.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.533
And it's this air resistance

08:54.535 --> 08:56.601
That decelerates
the terminal velocity of a human

08:56.603 --> 09:00.605
From 120 miles an hour
to less than 5 miles per hour

09:00.607 --> 09:01.706
For a soft landing.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.241
So that's
what we're trying to match.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.510
Yep,
it's a head-to-head challenge

09:05.512 --> 09:09.281
That's going to require
some clever crafting.

09:09.283 --> 09:10.181
Whoa.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.150
What hotel
are you staying in?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.585
The ritz?
I don't know.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.120
This looks more like
the kind of hotel

09:15.122 --> 09:17.289
Where you could
rent the hot tub by the hour.

09:17.291 --> 09:20.025
And each mythbuster
is opting for

09:20.027 --> 09:21.459
A different shape of canopy.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.294
It's quite a challenge,

09:22.296 --> 09:25.297
Especially with
shower curtains and sheets.

09:25.299 --> 09:29.434
Grant's going for
144 square feet of fabric.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.504
I already ripped it.

09:32.506 --> 09:33.238
That's not a good thing.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.273
While kari is
sewing sheets into

09:35.275 --> 09:37.175
A more traditional dome design.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.511
I'm using the cord from
the curtains to tie it together,

09:39.513 --> 09:41.580
And then I'm leaving
a hole right in the middle

09:41.582 --> 09:45.584
So that it should
sail down straight.

09:45.586 --> 09:46.618
If that doesn't work, I'm gonna

09:46.620 --> 09:48.753
Tie a pillow to my head
like a helmet.

09:48.755 --> 09:49.454
And tory is

09:49.456 --> 09:51.856
Patching together
a rectangular chute.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.259
So, we're already
one hour into this challenge,

09:54.261 --> 09:56.361
And I'm looking at
the size of my parachute.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.330
I don't think
this is gonna be good enough.

09:58.332 --> 10:00.932
I don't think
I'm gonna get this done.

10:02.568 --> 10:03.335
It's my harness.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.736
What is that,
the new fall fashion?

10:04.738 --> 10:06.705
Okay, time pressure
is starting to get to me

10:06.707 --> 10:08.907
Because I just don't think
I can get this done.

10:08.909 --> 10:12.110
I don't think I can
get this done in three hours.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.880
With less than
five minutes to go,

10:15.882 --> 10:19.217
The guys race to
stitch up this challenge.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.452
So, what I've done is
I've ripped out

10:20.454 --> 10:23.788
All the electrical wiring
in my hotel room.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.623
Saw macgyver do this once.

10:24.625 --> 10:28.059
And I'm gonna use that as
my stringers for my parachute.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.128
I am feeling
pretty darn confident.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.031
And with
some last-minute adjustments...

10:33.033 --> 10:34.566
If this is
knotting on the ground,

10:34.568 --> 10:37.068
What's it gonna do in the air?

10:37.070 --> 10:38.903
Oh, man!

10:38.905 --> 10:40.472
I got 60 seconds.

10:40.474 --> 10:44.776
...The cutting,
taping, sewing, and sweating

10:44.778 --> 10:45.310
Comes to an end.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.878
And...

10:46.880 --> 10:47.746
Done!

10:47.748 --> 10:49.481
Done.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.148
Done.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.816
Three hours, three Mythbusters,

10:51.818 --> 10:55.387
And three hotel rooms
full of fabric later,

10:55.389 --> 10:58.423
And they've got three parachutes
ready for the drop zone.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.059
You might think
it looks a little flimsy,

11:01.061 --> 11:03.028
But, hey,
it's only got to work once.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.963
Is this gonna save
buster's life? I don't know.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.431
But if I had to
jump off a building

11:06.433 --> 11:09.234
And I had a choice between
no parachute and this parachute,

11:09.236 --> 11:10.969
I guarantee you,
I'll take this choice.

11:10.971 --> 11:15.106
Wow, kari, that's a
nice-looking parachute you made.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.208
It actually
looks like a parachute.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.644
Yeah, it's an artistic rendition
of a parachute.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.513
Let's see if it
actually flies like one.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.380
All right.
Are you ready?

11:22.382 --> 11:25.383
Let's do it.
All right.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.853
Later, buster goes down...

11:28.855 --> 11:30.188
- Whoa!
- Hey!

11:30.190 --> 11:31.289
Look at him!
Hey!

11:31.291 --> 11:33.191
...And the tension ramps up.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.226
Let's launch the beast.
It's now or never.

11:35.228 --> 11:39.964
But can a motorcycle
ever turn motorboat?

11:44.904 --> 11:47.872
It's a myth that's
hell on two wheels,

11:47.874 --> 11:51.376
But could a motorbike
ever turn motorboat?

11:51.378 --> 11:54.813
Well, so far,
you can lead a bike to water,

11:54.815 --> 11:56.548
But you can't make it skim.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.350
However, all is not lost.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.786
Well, I, for one,
learned a lot from that test.

12:01.788 --> 12:04.322
Yeah, who knew that
you could wheelie across water

12:04.324 --> 12:06.057
And that your head
would fall off?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.093
Look,
I want to somehow see

12:08.095 --> 12:10.161
If a motorcycle wheel
at speed

12:10.163 --> 12:13.131
Gains real buoyancy
on the water's surface,

12:13.133 --> 12:14.332
But how are we gonna
get one of these

12:14.334 --> 12:16.501
Going 60 or 70 miles an hour
on water

12:16.503 --> 12:17.969
Under
controlled conditions?

12:17.971 --> 12:20.004
Well, riding on water
says "boat" to me,

12:20.006 --> 12:22.540
So why don't we hang a wheel
off the side of a boat?

12:22.542 --> 12:25.944
They make boats that
go 70 or 80 miles an hour?

12:25.946 --> 12:26.644
You bet they do.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.981
With top speeds of
over 90 miles per hour,

12:29.983 --> 12:33.418
Powerboats sure can
pace across a pond.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.521
But before they
feel the need for speed,

12:36.523 --> 12:41.092
First they need to rustle up
the wheel in the water.

12:41.094 --> 12:41.693
What you got?

12:41.695 --> 12:44.429
Well, at its most basic,
this is the boat.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.931
This is the motorcycle wheel
in scale to that boat.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.000
Obviously, it can
sit in the water like this,

12:49.002 --> 12:50.935
And when we
get up to speed,

12:50.937 --> 12:54.405
If the wheel does get buoyancy,
it would rise up.

12:54.407 --> 12:58.209
And then the question is,
how much weight can it support?

12:58.211 --> 12:59.677
And that's
where this comes in.

12:59.679 --> 13:03.715
We can put on barbell weights
of various sizes

13:03.717 --> 13:05.717
Until we
determine how much weight.

13:05.719 --> 13:06.084
Sure.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.286
I think this is
pretty straightforward.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.321
It may be
straightforward for Adam,

13:10.323 --> 13:12.924
But for the rest of us,
here's a graphic.

13:12.926 --> 13:16.761
The weight of a motorbike
means that in water, it'll sink.

13:16.763 --> 13:20.565
But if its wheels were
spinning at highway speeds,

13:20.567 --> 13:22.867
Could that keep it afloat?

13:22.869 --> 13:24.035
To find out, the plan is to

13:24.037 --> 13:27.105
Attach a motorbike wheel
to a speedboat.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.907
Then, as the boat accelerates,

13:28.909 --> 13:32.510
The wheel should
spin up onto the surface.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.212
But will it stay above water

13:34.214 --> 13:38.082
If the weight of a rider
is added to it?

13:38.584 --> 13:41.753
It's a dastardly design,

13:41.755 --> 13:42.453
But in the workshop,

13:42.455 --> 13:45.190
Adam's
galloping through the build.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.826
I don't know, for some reason,

13:47.828 --> 13:49.527
It reminds me of
a horse rearing up.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.298
a horse made of steel.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.434
And before
you can say "chrome pony,"

13:56.436 --> 14:00.672
His steel-rim rig
is ready to saddle up.

14:01.073 --> 14:05.310
And at a local lake,
it's time to put it to the test.

14:05.745 --> 14:06.878
The open air, the sun ...

14:06.880 --> 14:09.480
There's just nothing not to love
about boating.

14:09.482 --> 14:09.948
Honestly.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.550
Let's get this thing
in the water.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.017
Okay.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.386
This here
is our test platform ...

14:15.388 --> 14:18.723
20 feet long with
a 300 horsepower outboard engine

14:18.725 --> 14:20.024
And a tunnel-hull design.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.527
She is built for racing,
built for speed

14:22.529 --> 14:25.830
And will go between
85 and 90 miles per hour ...

14:25.832 --> 14:27.765
Perfect for
our testing purposes.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.001
First up, we need to
get our rig bolted to it.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.170
The plan here is simple ...

14:32.172 --> 14:33.171
Bolt the wheel to the boat...

14:33.173 --> 14:38.343
I claim this scientific rig
in the name of "Mythbusters."

14:39.078 --> 14:41.279
...Lower the boat
into the water...

14:41.281 --> 14:42.480
Perfect.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.983
...And then take it for a spin.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.517
Let's
get this party started.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.719
All right.

14:49.255 --> 14:51.422
Are you ready?
Ready.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.924
Go!

14:52.926 --> 14:55.193
But almost immediately,

14:55.195 --> 14:57.161
It's clear that
there's a problem.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.063
The tail end is so heavy that

14:59.065 --> 15:01.666
The boat's not only
taking on water...

15:01.668 --> 15:04.269
You're spilling water
over the side there.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.437
...Its top speed has plummeted.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.740
Our problem is,
there's so much drag,

15:08.742 --> 15:11.242
The boat's not able to
get up on a plane,

15:11.244 --> 15:12.844
Where it
sits on top of the water.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.846
That's
where the real speed happens.

15:14.848 --> 15:17.015
Jamie's gonna
crawl up to the bow,

15:17.017 --> 15:18.416
I'm gonna rig the wheel up,

15:18.418 --> 15:20.151
And we'll see if it works.

15:20.153 --> 15:20.852
So, with Jamie

15:20.854 --> 15:22.887
Clinging on
as a counterbalance...

15:23.590 --> 15:27.258
I've actually done this before
to hang on top of a car.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.628
...It's the moment of truth.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.629
Okay.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.897
All right, here we go.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.300
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

15:35.302 --> 15:37.035
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

15:37.037 --> 15:39.837
At first,
it all hangs in the balance,

15:39.839 --> 15:42.173
But when Adam
gives the wheel a heave,

15:42.175 --> 15:43.841
They finally pick up speed.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.543
There he goes.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.544
Yes!

15:48.180 --> 15:50.214
As the boat clocks 50...

15:50.216 --> 15:52.583
Yes! Yeah!

15:52.585 --> 15:54.585
...Then 60 miles per hour...

15:54.587 --> 15:55.186
Totally works!

15:55.188 --> 15:59.924
...It's clear that
the wheel is riding the water,

15:59.926 --> 16:02.660
Which is great for the myth.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.962
What's less great is that

16:03.964 --> 16:07.298
This crazy contraption
is so dangerous...

16:07.300 --> 16:09.133
Yeah!

16:09.135 --> 16:10.768
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.103
Wait up.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.271
It's scary.

16:13.273 --> 16:18.743
...That the guys decide to
quit while they're ahead.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.011
Ooh.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.481
Whoo!

16:24.084 --> 16:26.818
All right, I've got
some good new and some bad news.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.987
I am going to
start with the bad.

16:28.989 --> 16:29.787
The bad news is is that

16:29.789 --> 16:31.522
Our rig didn't quite
work as planned.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.092
We had really wanted to
start to add weight

16:34.094 --> 16:36.527
And experiment with
different speeds of the boat

16:36.529 --> 16:37.261
To come up with a graph

16:37.263 --> 16:39.063
Of speed-to-weight ratio
that would tell us

16:39.065 --> 16:42.033
Exactly how fast
we'd have to hit the water at

16:42.035 --> 16:44.969
For the motorcycle wheel
to support its rider.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.904
And we didn't quite get that.

16:46.906 --> 16:47.438
The good news is

16:47.440 --> 16:49.474
Is that even though
it took everything we had,

16:49.476 --> 16:51.676
We were able to
get the boat up on a plane

16:51.678 --> 16:53.378
And the wheel
skipping across the water,

16:53.380 --> 16:55.146
Which means that
there is something to this,

16:55.148 --> 16:58.116
And it means we can proceed
with some confidence

16:58.118 --> 17:01.919
To full scale
that this might just work.

17:03.088 --> 17:07.157
Cornered by the cops,
could you improvise a parachute,

17:07.160 --> 17:11.095
Defeat the free fall,
and flee to freedom?

17:11.097 --> 17:11.628
To find out,

17:11.631 --> 17:14.365
Kari, tory, and grant
have unraveled the rip cord

17:14.367 --> 17:18.202
And now have three
makeshift chutes to deploy.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.170
It's time to find out

17:19.172 --> 17:21.705
If any of our
do-it-yourself hotel parachutes

17:21.708 --> 17:23.875
Can decelerate buster
gently to the ground.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.511
We've come out to treasure
island on a beautiful day

17:26.512 --> 17:29.781
With a crane that could lift him
20 stories into the air.

17:29.783 --> 17:32.316
We're going to drop him
with each of our designs,

17:32.318 --> 17:35.253
But first, the control ...
no parachute.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.954
Now, to find out
exactly what buster

17:36.956 --> 17:39.057
Is going to be experiencing
in this drop,

17:39.059 --> 17:40.825
We're gonna attach
an accelerometer.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.693
Now,
for him to survive this fall,

17:42.695 --> 17:44.796
He has to withstand
less than 100 g's.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.931
For him to
survive the fall without injury,

17:46.933 --> 17:49.801
He has to withstand
less than 10 g's.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.636
Don't look so sad, buddy.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.470
Yep, once again,

17:52.472 --> 17:54.539
Buster will have to
do what he does best

17:54.541 --> 17:57.708
And take the fall from 200 feet.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.643
All right, here we go.

17:58.645 --> 18:02.680
Bye-bye, buster,
in three, two, one...

18:04.416 --> 18:07.085
Ohh.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.820
Oh!

18:08.887 --> 18:11.022
God,
I don't even want to know

18:11.024 --> 18:12.123
What the g's are on that.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.792
Well,
thanks to the accelerometer...

18:14.794 --> 18:16.794
All right,
let's see what we got.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.130
...It's easy enough to find out.

18:19.132 --> 18:21.866
Wow, look at that ...
500 g's.

18:21.868 --> 18:25.069
And he hit the ground
at 83 miles an hour.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.338
He definitely
did not survive that.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.307
But will jumping from 20 stories

18:29.309 --> 18:33.077
With a homemade chute
be any better?

18:33.079 --> 18:33.678
Oh!

18:33.680 --> 18:35.680
Here's why we're hoping
our parachutes will work ...

18:35.682 --> 18:39.150
Gravity acts on all objects,
no matter how much they weigh,

18:39.152 --> 18:41.652
Causing them to
fall at the same rate.

18:42.921 --> 18:43.988
Go, go, go!

18:43.990 --> 18:44.655
Yeah!

18:44.657 --> 18:46.057
The only reason why
two objects

18:46.059 --> 18:47.725
Won't fall at the same rate

18:47.727 --> 18:49.193
Is because of air resistance.

18:49.195 --> 18:51.496
These two pieces of paper,
in fact,

18:51.498 --> 18:52.964
Do weigh the same amount.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.199
But this one
has a lot more surface area.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.536
It has to push a lot more
air molecules out of the way

18:58.538 --> 19:00.838
To fall down, and thus...

19:01.907 --> 19:03.708
In order for
this myth to be confirmed,

19:03.710 --> 19:06.310
This is what our parachutes
will have to do.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.545
You ready?

19:07.547 --> 19:08.179
I'm ready.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.747
And first to attempt that

19:09.749 --> 19:12.049
Is tory's
blackout-curtain canopy.

19:12.051 --> 19:15.119
That's something
you don't see every day.

19:16.054 --> 19:18.489
Blackout-curtain
parachute drop,

19:18.491 --> 19:21.492
In three, two, one...

19:22.127 --> 19:24.662
Whoo!
Oh!

19:25.330 --> 19:26.964
Yeah!

19:27.299 --> 19:31.669
Amazingly, tory's chute deployed
and slowed buster down,

19:31.671 --> 19:36.908
But unfortunately, not enough
to head off the impact.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.910
Oh, buster
lost his head.

19:38.912 --> 19:40.411
Oh, no.
And his hand.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.747
Oh, that is a bad sign.

19:43.549 --> 19:46.651
So, we just dropped
the blackout-curtain parachute.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.451
And there's some good news,

19:47.453 --> 19:48.719
But there's
some really bad news.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.388
The good news is,
the parachute opened

19:50.390 --> 19:53.858
And it
decelerated buster's descent.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.525
However, the bad news ...

19:54.527 --> 19:58.196
When he hit the ground,
he hit it with 160 g's.

19:58.198 --> 20:01.132
That's well over 100 g's.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.366
Therefore, buster is dead.

20:02.368 --> 20:06.170
That
brings the curtain down on tory.

20:06.172 --> 20:09.807
But grant's frame-up
is still to go.

20:09.809 --> 20:10.508
Aah!

20:10.510 --> 20:11.609
Hey-oh!
Whoa!

20:11.611 --> 20:12.543
Oh!
Ah!

20:12.545 --> 20:14.612
We got
a technical difficulty.

20:14.614 --> 20:15.680
Oh, boy.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.415
Trouble in "mythbuster" land.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.951
The wind has picked up,
and apparently,

20:19.953 --> 20:22.720
Grant's rig does not like that.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.722
Had to be a windy day,
didn't it?

20:24.724 --> 20:28.092
Grant and his frame
are all bent out of shape.

20:28.094 --> 20:32.296
But can the parachute
still bring buster down safely?

20:32.298 --> 20:33.364
Look! It's batman!

20:33.366 --> 20:35.433
you guys.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.168
He's gonna be "flat-man"
in a second.

20:37.170 --> 20:38.703
Oh, man.

20:38.705 --> 20:39.804
Oh, boy.

20:39.806 --> 20:40.705
here we go.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.207
This is
canopy parachute,

20:43.209 --> 20:46.811
In three, two, one...

20:47.779 --> 20:51.616
Hey! Hey!
Look at it!

20:52.719 --> 20:55.052
Hey!
That kind of worked!

20:55.054 --> 20:55.553
Whoo-hoo!

20:55.555 --> 20:57.388
Yep, as it turns out,

20:57.390 --> 20:59.624
That was an impact of 144 g's ...

20:59.626 --> 21:04.829
A quarter of the control,
but still a lethal landing.

21:04.963 --> 21:07.131
He hit the ground
at 29 miles an hour.

21:07.133 --> 21:11.002
That is well above
our benchmark of 100 g's,

21:11.004 --> 21:11.602
Which is survivable.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.704
So, buster died
with that parachute.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.773
And for buster's final flight,

21:15.775 --> 21:18.976
It's time to put
kari's six sheets to the wind.

21:18.978 --> 21:22.146
Look, I like my design,
but honestly,

21:22.148 --> 21:24.715
I wish I had
thought of kari's design.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.417
I mean, look at it ...
it looks like

21:26.419 --> 21:28.619
A real modern day parachute.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.121
Come on, criminal!

21:30.123 --> 21:31.255
It's got
a huge amount of surface area,

21:31.257 --> 21:35.526
And it's got a vent at the top
to direct the air through,

21:35.528 --> 21:37.528
So it's gonna have
great stability.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.296
I think this one has

21:38.298 --> 21:41.265
A really good chance of
saving buster.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.067
This is curtain parachute,

21:43.069 --> 21:45.903
In three, two, one...

21:45.905 --> 21:47.505
There you go!

21:47.507 --> 21:49.006
Oh!

21:49.574 --> 21:50.808
Aw!

21:50.810 --> 21:52.543
You had
a little deployment issue.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.478
Late deployment!

21:54.480 --> 21:58.649
Kari's late-deploying chute
did decelerate buster,

21:58.651 --> 22:02.053
But he still hit the ground
at 160 g's ...

22:02.055 --> 22:04.188
Well above the lethal limit.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.924
Okay, this is not
looking good for the myth.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.893
I mean, we looked at the data
for all the drops.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.828
There is not
one survivable fall.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.063
We have to
start from scratch.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.331
Well, maybe
we try different fabrics,

22:13.333 --> 22:15.966
Pick out the best parts
of each of our designs.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.668
All right, well,
let's go back to the shop

22:17.670 --> 22:18.703
And see if we can
figure out how to

22:18.705 --> 22:21.238
Make a parachute
that actually works.

22:23.000 --> 22:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:33.985 --> 22:37.521
Youtube says "yes."

22:37.523 --> 22:39.990
The Mythbusters say "maybe."

22:39.992 --> 22:41.392
Yeah!

22:41.394 --> 22:41.992
Whoo!

22:41.994 --> 22:47.431
But can a motorbike really
skate the surface of a lake?

22:50.335 --> 22:53.804
I think I might...
Have beat Jamie.

22:54.439 --> 22:55.172
Maybe not.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.841
Well, it's time for this myth

22:56.843 --> 22:58.242
To surf up or ship out.

22:58.244 --> 23:00.845
Ever since we first started
talking about doing this story,

23:00.847 --> 23:03.347
We knew, of course,
we'd finish on a lake.

23:03.349 --> 23:05.850
And we had a very specific
list of attributes

23:05.852 --> 23:08.185
We considered critical
for this lake to have

23:08.187 --> 23:10.454
In order for us to
have any chance of success.

23:10.456 --> 23:13.457
Number one, the lake
needed to be smooth and calm.

23:13.459 --> 23:17.261
Two, we needed
the land-to-water transition

23:17.263 --> 23:18.229
To be incredibly gentle,

23:18.231 --> 23:19.964
And, three,
we needed that transition

23:19.966 --> 23:23.134
Between land and water
to be not too muddy.

23:23.136 --> 23:26.504
And amazingly,
we found everything we need

23:26.506 --> 23:28.906
In this lake
in ione, california,

23:28.908 --> 23:31.542
And in a few minutes,
what looks like a lake

23:31.544 --> 23:34.145
May end up, in fact,
being a motocross course.

23:34.147 --> 23:38.282
But before Jamie
"trips the lake fantastic,"

23:38.284 --> 23:43.087
They first need a rider
with some serious grunt

23:43.089 --> 23:46.724
And some serious
stunt expertise.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.359
Meet eric mccrummen.

23:48.361 --> 23:50.461
What do you think, eric?
Are you up for it?

23:50.463 --> 23:50.828
Sure.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.330
Eric is the designated driver,

23:53.332 --> 23:56.467
But there's
one last thing to clarify.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.436
I am currently standing in

23:58.438 --> 24:00.070
The path our motorcyclist

24:00.072 --> 24:01.439
Is going to take
across the water,

24:01.441 --> 24:04.074
And it is
38 inches deep in the middle.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.777
If that motorcycle
makes it across,

24:06.779 --> 24:08.045
It rode on the water.

24:08.047 --> 24:08.612
That's official.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.681
Yep, it'll be official,

24:10.683 --> 24:12.383
But only if it works,

24:12.385 --> 24:13.384
Which means it's time for

24:13.386 --> 24:16.187
The rubber
to meet the reservoir.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.021
Well, he's all set.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.923
He's 375 feet away.

24:18.925 --> 24:19.857
You want to wave him in?

24:19.859 --> 24:21.358
Let's launch the beast.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.626
It's now or never.

24:22.628 --> 24:23.761
Okay.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.203
Here he comes.

24:35.373 --> 24:36.207
Whoa!

24:36.209 --> 24:38.709
that worked!

24:42.547 --> 24:44.415
He totally
stayed on top of the water.

24:44.417 --> 24:45.115
That was beautiful.

24:45.117 --> 24:48.152
He, like, parted it,
like a little red sea.

24:49.355 --> 24:50.788
That was amazing!

24:50.790 --> 24:52.022
Amazing is right.

24:52.024 --> 24:55.226
Remember,
the lake is over 3 feet deep.

24:55.228 --> 24:56.627
Yet, instead of sinking,

24:56.629 --> 25:01.632
Eric sailed 50 feet
at 60 miles per hour.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.568
But now
Adam and Jamie want more.

25:04.570 --> 25:07.271
Do you feel like
you could go a little longer?

25:07.273 --> 25:07.938
I think so.

25:07.940 --> 25:08.739
Excellent!

25:08.741 --> 25:11.175
I have to say, I'm pretty
pleased about this so far.

25:11.177 --> 25:15.846
Eric successfully just
crossed 50 feet of open water,

25:15.848 --> 25:17.815
Not fake water
with land underneath ...

25:17.817 --> 25:20.885
Deep, open water ...
50 feet on a motorcycle.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.887
So, now we're gonna
cross 100 feet.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.623
He's gonna go for
a 100-foot length of water,

25:25.625 --> 25:27.424
And we're just gonna
see how far we can get.

25:27.426 --> 25:30.361
Yep, they're
doubling down on the dirt bike.

25:30.363 --> 25:33.898
But will eric make it
to the other side this time?

25:33.900 --> 25:35.132
I'm excited ...
100 feet.

25:35.134 --> 25:38.002
It's time to put our money
where our mouth is.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.069
Let's do it!

25:39.971 --> 25:44.041
The pressure is on
as eric revs the bike...

25:44.810 --> 25:48.846
...Gets it
up to 60 miles per hour...

25:49.581 --> 25:50.781
...And...

25:51.816 --> 25:54.084
Wow! Yeah!

25:54.086 --> 25:57.288
...Leaves the lake in his wake.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.256
He was
on top of the water.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.658
He was totally!
I mean, he was actually ...

26:00.660 --> 26:03.494
I saw him do this
on top of the water.

26:03.496 --> 26:05.162
That was beautiful!

26:05.164 --> 26:07.064
It's clear
from what we're seeing ...

26:07.066 --> 26:09.133
When this bike
goes across the water,

26:09.135 --> 26:10.868
It's riding on the water.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.504
Because we can see
the wheel is bouncing.

26:13.506 --> 26:14.204
It's just like it was

26:14.206 --> 26:16.907
When we were on the speedboat
doing our bench test.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.209
That means that
it's hitting the water

26:19.211 --> 26:20.311
And rebounding off of it.

26:20.313 --> 26:21.745
It means that
we're riding on water.

26:21.747 --> 26:25.683
And that means this myth
is well and truly confirmed.

26:25.685 --> 26:29.086
But it's not
the end of the road yet.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.454
Dude,
I believe we have proven

26:30.456 --> 26:33.357
That you can ride a motorcycle
across the water.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.158
I think we have.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.926
But, you know,
I have a question.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.460
What's that?

26:36.462 --> 26:38.095
Is what is happening there

26:38.097 --> 26:40.497
Actually
due to his momentum,

26:40.499 --> 26:42.866
Like skipping a stone
across the water,

26:42.868 --> 26:46.070
Or is a bike this powerful
capable of actually

26:46.072 --> 26:47.504
Going out like a watercraft

26:47.506 --> 26:51.208
And continuing to power its way
across the top of water?

26:51.210 --> 26:53.911
That is
a good question.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.713
I want to try it.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.117
Okay.

27:03.221 --> 27:07.725
Pulling the cords on
peculiar parachutes is not new.

27:08.327 --> 27:11.261
But could you source
a successful chute

27:11.263 --> 27:12.930
From your hotel room?

27:14.233 --> 27:17.868
After
a free-fall free-for-all...

27:19.504 --> 27:20.137
...Maybe not.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.506
Buster did not
survive any of these drops.

27:22.508 --> 27:26.176
So now they want to know if
anything in a hotel room

27:26.178 --> 27:27.911
Could let you down safely.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.380
Since our
do-it-yourself parachutes

27:29.382 --> 27:31.749
Didn't quite
give us the results we wanted,

27:31.751 --> 27:32.750
We've come back to the shop

27:32.752 --> 27:33.817
To do some
small-scale experiments.

27:33.819 --> 27:37.821
We're gonna test every fabric
you might find in a hotel room.

27:37.823 --> 27:38.922
I'm gonna make small parachutes,

27:38.924 --> 27:41.492
Put them on top of
a big, industrial fan,

27:41.494 --> 27:42.493
Blow it upwards,

27:42.495 --> 27:43.260
And see which parachute is

27:43.262 --> 27:45.496
Actually going to
yield the best results.

27:45.498 --> 27:49.099
Now, our benchmark for this test
will be real parachute material.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.801
In the end,
what we're looking for

27:50.803 --> 27:52.503
Is the material
that best matches

27:52.505 --> 27:54.371
A parachute's loft and weight.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.374
Oh, yeah, and something that can
also be found in a hotel room.

27:57.376 --> 28:00.144
Now, instead of having
our parachute falling down,

28:00.146 --> 28:01.378
We're gonna have it stationary

28:01.380 --> 28:04.281
And have the fan
blow air up into the chute,

28:04.283 --> 28:06.550
Acting as if
the parachuter were falling.

28:06.552 --> 28:07.384
And then we're gonna find out

28:07.386 --> 28:09.953
Which material
has the best wind resistance

28:09.955 --> 28:12.489
So we can see which material
makes the best parachute.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.224
Yep, it's all about the fabric

28:14.226 --> 28:17.728
With the most air resistance,
or loft.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.463
So, with a force meter attached,

28:19.465 --> 28:22.800
They fire up the fan
for the control ...

28:22.802 --> 28:24.368
The real parachute.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.402
Hey!

28:25.837 --> 28:28.872
All right,
it looks good and stable.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.809
1.79 for the control.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.644
So, that's
our ideal performance.

28:33.646 --> 28:35.546
1.79 is the lift to beat,

28:35.548 --> 28:40.451
And the first makeshift chute
is the shower curtain.

28:40.453 --> 28:41.752
We're at 1.86.

28:41.754 --> 28:45.255
This has better wind resistance
than the parachute material.

28:45.257 --> 28:48.592
Then they try
the blackout curtain.

28:48.594 --> 28:50.694
2.0.
2 pounds?!

28:50.696 --> 28:52.529
That is our best performer
so far.

28:52.531 --> 28:55.399
And finally,
the remaining swatches.

28:55.401 --> 28:59.536
Okay, we've settled at 1.37
for the polyester drape.

28:59.538 --> 29:03.140
All right, 1.67
for the cotton sheet.

29:03.142 --> 29:03.507
Next.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.843
Okay, looks like
we got 1.65.

29:05.845 --> 29:08.045
Canvas curtain
pretty good as a parachute.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.848
That's five pocket parachutes

29:10.850 --> 29:13.350
And five
impressive lift results.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.285
But that's not
all they're looking for.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.588
We have a winner ...
the blackout curtain.

29:17.590 --> 29:18.689
It was the most air-resistant,

29:18.691 --> 29:20.758
And gave us
2 pounds of pulling force.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.427
However, the problem here is
it's heavy.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.094
So, what I need to do is

29:24.096 --> 29:26.029
Weigh each of these
parachute materials

29:26.031 --> 29:27.164
And see
which one is the lightest

29:27.166 --> 29:32.035
And has similar air resistance
to our parachute material.

29:54.893 --> 29:57.828
So it turns out,
the winner is ... shower curtain.

29:57.830 --> 29:58.562
This is what we're gonna

29:58.564 --> 29:59.997
Build our final parachute
out of.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.232
So, while the blackout curtain

30:02.234 --> 30:03.467
Had the most air resistance,

30:03.469 --> 30:05.569
The shower curtain was lighter.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.337
And that, coupled with its lift,

30:07.339 --> 30:10.440
Makes it the best material
for full scale.

30:10.442 --> 30:11.742
So, we've chosen
the shower curtain

30:11.744 --> 30:14.978
As our final material
for our parachute.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.848
And now that means
we have to scale up.

30:17.850 --> 30:18.982
Here's how it goes.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.851
Gravity over rho.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.853
9.8 meters per second squared.

30:22.855 --> 30:26.156
Diameter is
2 times the square root of...

30:26.158 --> 30:30.227
A diameter equivalent to
17.4 feet.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.796
Now, you could never get that
much shower curtain

30:32.798 --> 30:33.831
Out of one room.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.465
But if you had a whole floor?

30:35.467 --> 30:36.133
Now you're talking.

30:36.135 --> 30:39.102
With a diameter of 17.4 feet,

30:39.104 --> 30:42.406
Their shower-curtain chute
is gonna be giant.

30:42.408 --> 30:45.809
So they've opted for
the classic dome design.

30:45.811 --> 30:49.479
But making a hemisphere
out of square curtains

30:49.481 --> 30:51.481
Means they need a plan.

30:51.483 --> 30:52.649
This is
a little pattern model of

30:52.651 --> 30:54.852
What our finished parachute
should actually look like.

30:54.854 --> 30:57.955
We're actually going to
take each of these pieces

30:57.957 --> 31:01.592
And make a large pattern
out of paper

31:01.594 --> 31:04.361
And then construct each one
out of shower curtain.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.630
Now, it's hard to
actually figure the scale

31:06.632 --> 31:09.700
Till you really
see the pattern laid out.

31:09.702 --> 31:12.936
This is going to be
a huge parachute.

31:12.938 --> 31:14.504
It's a mammoth task of

31:14.506 --> 31:17.608
Attaching 24 curtains
with duct tape...

31:17.610 --> 31:20.878
If this duct tape doesn't hold,
buster's doomed.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.882
...And then
cutting out the six panels.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.984
Now we stitch them
all together, right?

31:26.986 --> 31:28.185
Oh, yeah.

31:28.187 --> 31:28.952
All right.

31:28.954 --> 31:30.153
Now, after actually

31:30.155 --> 31:31.755
Making our pattern,
cutting it all out,

31:31.757 --> 31:35.792
I think our original parachutes
were a lot more labor-intensive

31:35.794 --> 31:37.895
And took a lot longer
to put together.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.363
Is that all...
The pieces?

31:39.365 --> 31:40.998
Yeah, that's it.
That's the pieces.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.499
That's it
for the main chute.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.534
Now to
bring in the reinforcements.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.871
Our next job is to
reinforce this hole at the top,

31:47.873 --> 31:51.375
Which is actually gonna
bear a large amount of the load.

31:51.377 --> 31:54.912
With a little curtain cord
taking up the slack,

31:54.914 --> 31:56.880
The last element is the lines.

31:56.882 --> 31:58.081
almost done.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.550
This is it ...
the last two lines.

32:00.552 --> 32:01.118
And with that,

32:01.120 --> 32:05.589
It looks like this canopy caper
is all stitched-up.

32:07.558 --> 32:08.492
That might work.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.427
Shower curtains
and duct tape ...

32:10.429 --> 32:11.762
Who would have thought?

32:11.764 --> 32:15.065
Next stop ...
30 stories high.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.366
Cool.

32:20.305 --> 32:22.005
Please don't try
anything you see us do at home.

32:22.007 --> 32:25.242
This is dangerous work,
and we're professionals.

32:28.713 --> 32:31.548
So far
in this parachute escapade,

32:31.550 --> 32:37.821
For buster, it's been
more high dive than skydive.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.256
But will that change with their

32:39.258 --> 32:42.092
Best-case scenario
shower-curtain chute?

32:42.094 --> 32:44.828
Dude,
this is super cool.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.097
We're at
the mare island shipyard,

32:47.099 --> 32:50.901
Where we've been given access to
a 50-ton crane.

32:50.903 --> 32:52.436
Now, this is gonna
give us the ability to

32:52.438 --> 32:56.473
Raise our parachute and buster
30 stories into the air.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.775
We're going to drop him
into this dry dock

32:58.777 --> 33:01.044
With all his accelerometers
and find out

33:01.046 --> 33:03.246
If this is going to be
an effective parachute.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.682
That's an extra 10 stories

33:05.684 --> 33:08.151
To decelerate
their shower-chute.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.254
Chin up, buddy.

33:11.256 --> 33:14.558
So first, they need a frame
of reference at this height,

33:14.560 --> 33:18.762
With the most successful chute
from their previous test.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.697
All right,
go ahead and take it up.

33:20.699 --> 33:24.067
Just like
its drop from 20 stories,

33:24.069 --> 33:26.837
The frame
buckles under buster's weight.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.038
The good news is,
it's doing

33:28.040 --> 33:30.674
Exactly what it did
last time.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.142
But now it has
more time to decelerate.

33:32.144 --> 33:37.547
Okay, this is
hotel parachute with the frame,

33:37.549 --> 33:40.851
In three, two, one...

33:41.019 --> 33:42.819
Yeah.
Whoo!

33:43.921 --> 33:44.955
Hey!

33:44.957 --> 33:46.923
Oh. Oh!
Wow!

33:46.925 --> 33:49.659
Dang,
he hit the ground hard.

33:50.995 --> 33:53.830
Well, let's check the data
and see if he survived the fall.

33:53.832 --> 33:57.801
Look, I'm not a doctor,
but that does not look right.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.703
Yep, and closer examination

33:59.705 --> 34:01.505
Proves that
even from 30 stories,

34:01.507 --> 34:06.843
Buster still clocked
over 140 g's on his landing.

34:06.845 --> 34:10.547
Clearly, a 1-room parachute
is a flop,

34:10.549 --> 34:14.818
But can a 24-room
shower-curtain canopy

34:14.820 --> 34:15.851
Do any better.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.219
There's gonna be
a lot of wet floors

34:17.222 --> 34:18.655
With all these shower curtains
missing.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.757
I think they're gonna
bill it back to our room.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.192
This is it ...
the final experiment

34:22.194 --> 34:25.328
To see if you could take
materials from your hotel room,

34:25.330 --> 34:28.197
Make a parachute,
jump out, and survive.

34:28.199 --> 34:28.732
Now, we've taken

34:28.734 --> 34:30.199
Everything we've learned
from our small scale.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.002
We're gonna use
our shower curtain.

34:32.004 --> 34:34.103
We've made
a dome-shaped parachute,

34:34.106 --> 34:36.106
We put a hole in the top,
and we have a drag chute.

34:36.108 --> 34:38.809
This time, we're gonna be
dropping from 30 stories

34:38.811 --> 34:41.878
To see if
buster will actually survive.

34:41.880 --> 34:42.946
This is gonna be so awesome.

34:42.947 --> 34:45.815
Now, we know
from our initial experiment

34:45.818 --> 34:46.917
That without a parachute,

34:46.918 --> 34:49.786
Buster's impact
can get to 500 g's,

34:49.788 --> 34:51.487
And that's from 20 stories.

34:51.489 --> 34:52.956
The goal for today with our

34:52.958 --> 34:55.158
Super-final experiment
shower-curtain chute

34:55.159 --> 34:59.696
Is to get that number
down to 100 g's from 30 stories.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.399
Bonus is if we can
get that down to 10 g's ...

35:02.401 --> 35:04.334
That's a landing
you can walk away from.

35:04.336 --> 35:05.569
The team preps the canopy

35:05.571 --> 35:07.704
And, for stability,
adds a drag chute.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.106
Now, I know
what you're thinking ...

35:09.108 --> 35:10.407
"why do you guys
have a drag chute?

35:10.409 --> 35:10.941
That's no fair."

35:10.943 --> 35:12.309
Well, actually,
it's my laundry bag,

35:12.311 --> 35:13.643
And I travel with it
all the time.

35:13.645 --> 35:16.246
Then the lines are attached.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.914
All of these are 18-feet long,

35:17.916 --> 35:21.318
Which should give us
the minimum our lines should be

35:21.320 --> 35:24.521
So that it opens
to the perfect circumference

35:24.523 --> 35:26.556
And drops
at the most stable rate.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.325
I love
your optimism.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.560
Let's take it up.

35:31.262 --> 35:32.062
It's crazy, but a parachute

35:32.064 --> 35:33.997
Made out of
shower curtains and duct tape ...

35:33.999 --> 35:34.664
I think it's gonna work.

35:34.666 --> 35:38.401
Our science is sound.
The calculations all work out.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.035
It works on paper.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.138
I think buster
might actually land safety.

35:41.140 --> 35:44.908
Well, buster will have to
find that out the hard way,

35:44.910 --> 35:49.079
Or, if kari is right,
the soft way.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.714
Suspended from 30 stories,

35:50.716 --> 35:54.217
It's time for this myth's
shower-curtain call.

35:54.219 --> 35:55.152
All right, here we go.

35:55.154 --> 36:00.190
Shower-curtain parachute,
in three, two, one...

36:00.992 --> 36:02.559
Come on.

36:02.561 --> 36:03.293
Open.

36:03.295 --> 36:06.062
Open!
Oh!

36:08.000 --> 36:09.432
Do you think
it might have worked?

36:09.434 --> 36:12.169
Did you see
how light he landed?

36:12.171 --> 36:13.737
Let's go check the data.
Yes!

36:13.739 --> 36:17.174
Initially,
buster was on a crash course,

36:17.176 --> 36:18.575
But meters from the ground,

36:18.577 --> 36:21.711
Amazingly,
the shower curtains opened

36:21.713 --> 36:23.980
And gently slowed his drop.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.850
The question now is,
did he survive?

36:26.852 --> 36:29.553
Am I ... am I seeing
what I'm seeing?

36:29.555 --> 36:31.788
Yeah, that's the peak
right there.

36:31.790 --> 36:32.255
4 g's?!

36:32.257 --> 36:35.158
He survived the landing
without injury.

36:35.160 --> 36:35.825
That's so cool.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.728
Our parachute worked,
and the best part is,

36:38.730 --> 36:40.630
Buster received 4.2 g's,

36:40.632 --> 36:42.766
Which means
not only did he survive,

36:42.768 --> 36:44.968
He survived without injury.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.503
However, the problem here is,

36:46.505 --> 36:48.138
He had way more shower curtains

36:48.140 --> 36:49.506
Than the criminal
would have had,

36:49.508 --> 36:50.774
Way more time to build it,

36:50.776 --> 36:51.942
And the criminal didn't have

36:51.944 --> 36:54.444
The engineering
that we used to make this.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.947
So, even though
buster isn't busted,

36:56.949 --> 36:57.547
This myth is.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.749
Next, we hook this up
to the ironing board

36:59.751 --> 37:00.917
And go kite surfing!

37:00.919 --> 37:02.652
Come on!
Whoo!

37:03.422 --> 37:04.487
I can't pull it.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.590
It's too strong.

37:09.860 --> 37:11.328
After the break,

37:11.330 --> 37:14.297
Jamie puts his life on the line.

37:14.299 --> 37:14.898
Here he comes.

37:14.900 --> 37:19.502
But can he motocross over
4,000 feet of water?

37:19.504 --> 37:20.637
Whoa!

37:24.575 --> 37:25.141
Obviously,

37:25.143 --> 37:26.710
If you're gonna
ride a motorcycle on water,

37:26.712 --> 37:28.178
Weight is a huge issue,
as is power.

37:28.180 --> 37:30.447
And that's why I've chosen
this particular motorcycle ...

37:30.449 --> 37:33.183
Because it's made by
a company in indiana

37:33.185 --> 37:34.117
Called service power sports,

37:34.119 --> 37:37.754
And what they do is, they take
a lightweight aluminum chassis

37:37.756 --> 37:41.558
That normally only has
a 250cc engine on it.

37:41.560 --> 37:45.595
Instead, they put a 500cc,
high-performance,

37:45.597 --> 37:46.896
2-cycle motor on it,

37:46.898 --> 37:50.033
And that makes it,
power-for-pound,

37:50.035 --> 37:53.136
About as good as you can get
in a dirt bike.

37:53.138 --> 37:54.904
It's a rocket.

37:59.510 --> 38:00.076
Welcome back.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.911
All episode long,
we have been testing a story

38:01.913 --> 38:06.750
That a motorcycle might just
be a viable water vehicle.

38:06.752 --> 38:07.517
Seriously.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.619
And with a motorcycle wheel
strapped to

38:09.621 --> 38:12.522
The outside of
a high-powered speedboat

38:12.524 --> 38:13.890
Going 70 miles an hour,

38:13.892 --> 38:14.991
It really seemed like

38:14.993 --> 38:17.794
There might be
something to this story.

38:17.796 --> 38:18.261
Yeah!

38:18.263 --> 38:20.830
So, then we got
a professional motocross rider,

38:20.832 --> 38:23.933
And we gave him
100 feet of open water to cross,

38:23.935 --> 38:26.936
And he was able to do it.

38:27.805 --> 38:30.006
Wow! Yeah!

38:30.008 --> 38:32.842
But now mr. Hyneman
has a brand-new question ...

38:32.844 --> 38:33.410
Is the motorcycle

38:33.412 --> 38:35.745
Skipping across the water
on its own momentum

38:35.747 --> 38:39.783
Or does it have enough power
to continue indefinitely?

38:39.785 --> 38:41.184
And Jamie wants to try it.

38:41.186 --> 38:45.422
Yep, while eric
crossed a mere 100 feet,

38:45.424 --> 38:46.790
Jamie wants more.

38:46.792 --> 38:47.657
It's
a nice flat run.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.061
He wants to see if the bike can
get such a grip on the water

38:51.063 --> 38:55.298
That he can
speed across the entire lake.

38:55.866 --> 38:59.769
To do so, he'll literally be
putting his life on the line,

38:59.771 --> 39:03.273
But not without
some modifications.

39:04.775 --> 39:08.278
First, the run up to the water
needs to be smoother

39:08.280 --> 39:11.081
To let Jamie really let rip.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.115
I think that ought to do it.

39:12.117 --> 39:15.085
Then the bike
needs a flotation device

39:15.087 --> 39:17.821
So it doesn't drag him
to the bottom if he fails.

39:17.823 --> 39:20.457
I believe
I've got enough flotation here

39:20.459 --> 39:23.226
To make it float.

39:23.228 --> 39:23.660
Maybe.

39:23.662 --> 39:28.665
And finally,
a lifeguard team is on standby.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.001
This is
where it's all about to happen,

39:32.003 --> 39:33.770
But what exactly
is going to happen

39:33.772 --> 39:36.539
Here at the transition
between land and water?

39:36.541 --> 39:37.841
By the time
Jamie reaches this point,

39:37.843 --> 39:41.745
He should be going
between 55 and 75 miles per hour

39:41.747 --> 39:42.779
When he enters the water.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.315
Could he just skip
all the way across the water

39:45.317 --> 39:47.217
To the opposite side
of the lake,

39:47.219 --> 39:48.885
About 3/4 of a mile away?

39:48.887 --> 39:52.355
Or could he plant himself
right here and just start flying

39:52.357 --> 39:56.092
And become his own cautionary
discovery channel documentary

39:56.094 --> 39:57.227
About what not to do?

39:57.229 --> 40:00.830
It's one of
the most dangerous experiments

40:00.832 --> 40:04.200
In "Mythbusters" history.

40:06.303 --> 40:07.904
Here he comes.

40:10.641 --> 40:14.177
At breakneck speed,
Jamie hits the water,

40:14.179 --> 40:15.545
And then...

40:15.547 --> 40:16.246
Whoa!

40:16.248 --> 40:18.314
It's man over bike.

40:18.316 --> 40:20.016
Let's go over to him.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.552
Adam and the medic team rush in.

40:23.921 --> 40:24.421
He's good.

40:24.423 --> 40:28.391
But it'll take more than
a 70-mile-an-hour high dive

40:28.393 --> 40:29.759
To hurt the hyneman.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.095
You all right, sir?

40:32.097 --> 40:34.164
I'm just fine.

40:34.166 --> 40:36.399
I think
it did a little bit of a ...

40:36.401 --> 40:38.635
What is it,
a half-gainer or something

40:38.637 --> 40:41.171
Into the water?

40:41.539 --> 40:44.207
Definitely no broken bones
or anything.

40:44.209 --> 40:44.574
Good.

40:44.576 --> 40:47.444
The good news is that
Jamie's fighting fit.

40:47.446 --> 40:50.747
The bad news is that
he traveled only 80 feet,

40:50.749 --> 40:53.082
Far less than eric's effort.

40:53.084 --> 40:53.950
So, what went wrong?

40:53.952 --> 40:55.251
This is one of those cases where

40:55.253 --> 40:57.086
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.388
We added this foam, just so that

40:58.390 --> 41:01.191
We could retrieve the bike
without drowning it afterwards,

41:01.193 --> 41:04.594
But it turned out that the spray
coming up off of the wheel

41:04.596 --> 41:07.230
Was providing a certain
amount of lift back here,

41:07.232 --> 41:11.000
Which, in turn, made more stress
on the front wheel,

41:11.002 --> 41:13.603
Which made it plunge
and made me do a somersault.

41:13.605 --> 41:17.440
So, I'm gonna go back to
the original type of bike ...

41:17.442 --> 41:18.975
We have a second one ...

41:18.977 --> 41:22.145
And have another try.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.414
You heard that right.

41:24.416 --> 41:28.351
Jamie's getting
straight back on the horsepower.

41:28.353 --> 41:29.285
And what's more,

41:29.287 --> 41:33.490
This time,
he's upping the speed to 80.

41:33.492 --> 41:38.428
But will that allow him to
burn aqua all the way across?

41:40.798 --> 41:42.098
Yeah!

41:42.100 --> 41:44.200
Yeah!

41:44.202 --> 41:46.503
Oh!

41:47.338 --> 41:49.272
He's good!

41:49.274 --> 41:51.074
Beautiful!

41:51.076 --> 41:52.342
That was amazing!

41:52.344 --> 41:54.777
It seemed to go on forever!

41:54.779 --> 41:56.880
Riding, riding, riding, riding.

41:56.882 --> 42:00.049
That's, like,
easily 300 feet or more, buddy.

42:00.051 --> 42:01.551
That was amazing.

42:01.553 --> 42:03.152
Piece of cake.

42:07.324 --> 42:08.191
How you feeling?

42:08.193 --> 42:11.628
Relieved it's over
and I'm alive.

42:13.398 --> 42:16.165
Incredibly, Jamie hit the water,

42:16.167 --> 42:21.571
Throttled the throttle,
and surfed for over 300 feet.

42:21.573 --> 42:22.772
And while he wasn't able to

42:22.774 --> 42:25.308
Get a good enough grip
to carry on across,

42:25.310 --> 42:28.745
It's still myth,
well and truly, confirmed.

42:28.747 --> 42:32.682
In case there's any doubt,
I'm standing on the bike.

42:32.684 --> 42:35.785
It's in
about 8 feet of water, maybe.

42:35.787 --> 42:41.591
So I was riding on water
for about 300 feet.

42:45.696 --> 42:48.164
So, riding a motorcycle
across the water ...

42:48.166 --> 42:50.567
Busted, plausible,
or confirmed?

42:50.569 --> 42:51.100
Confirmed.

42:51.102 --> 42:53.036
Not recommended,
but it's confirmed.

42:53.038 --> 42:55.872
Yes,
but only for 300 feet.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.707
I was
hoping for further.

42:57.709 --> 43:00.176
I'll settle for that.

43:00.544 --> 43:01.778
And so will we,

43:01.780 --> 43:06.549
So why not cue the music
for a motocross water montage?

43:08.019 --> 43:09.385
Yeah!

43:16.894 --> 43:18.094
Yeah!

43:18.096 --> 43:20.096
Yeah!

43:21.298 --> 43:24.334
That was amazing!

43:24.336 --> 43:25.501
Have you had enough?

43:25.503 --> 43:26.369
Of course you haven't!
