08:16.562 --> 08:17.863
- Absolutely the best
suspension.

08:17.896 --> 08:20.766

real problems with them.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.901

is the ending.

And that's not the way it went.

09:15.620 --> 09:20.058
Wobble kind of drove us crazy,
the flexibility,

09:20.091 --> 09:23.663
because suspensions
are always really rigid.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.163
- Right.

09:25.197 --> 09:26.499
- They have to be really rigid
because of the way it works,

this flexibility in there.

11:57.182 --> 11:58.149
[cheers and applause]

11:58.183 --> 11:59.518
- Thank you.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.620
Thank you so much.
It's such an honor to be here.

12:01.653 --> 12:05.924
And as much as I would love to
perform the most mind-blowing,

12:05.957 --> 12:09.095
ass-kicking trick
you've ever seen.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.730
I think Alyson should do it.
Guys, give it up for Alyson.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.198
Alyson, will you join me?
[applause]

12:13.231 --> 12:15.868
Will you step into my office,
please? Yeah.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.102
- This could be a mistake.

12:17.135 --> 12:19.804
[laughter]
- No, no. I love mistakes. Yes.

12:19.838 --> 12:22.707
Alyson, it's such an honor.
Thank you for being here.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.643
Are you ready
to possibly perform

12:24.677 --> 12:27.513
the most kickass trick
ever on this stage?

12:27.546 --> 12:29.014
- Sure.
- Okay, fantastic.

12:29.048 --> 12:30.548
So, Alyson, for this to work,

12:30.582 --> 12:33.384
I want you to be as still
and relaxed as possible.

12:33.418 --> 12:35.520
- Oh!
[laughter]

12:35.553 --> 12:37.155
- So, Alyson, as you know,

12:37.188 --> 12:39.091
all the cards are separated
into two groups.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.827
Okay? They are all either black
or they are red.

12:42.861 --> 12:43.962
Alyson, makes sense to you?

12:43.995 --> 12:45.264
- Yes.
- Cool.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.999
Makes sense to you guys?
Pretty simple. Here we go.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.735
Oh, Alyson, will you mix up
the cards, please?

12:49.769 --> 12:52.504
Yeah, just give it a quick--I
want to see the Alyson shuffle.

12:52.538 --> 12:53.972
- Oh-oh.
[laughter]

12:54.005 --> 12:55.274
- I have nothing
but faith in you.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.476
Yes, the Alyson shuffle.
I've seen this on YouTube.

12:58.510 --> 12:59.778
But--oh, but never in person.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.846
This is very exciting.
Alyson, I love it.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.615
I love your style.
You're doing great.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.017
Yeah, and you can stop
at any time.

13:05.049 --> 13:07.318
You're doing great.
The Alyson shuffle.

13:07.352 --> 13:09.355
Give it up for the Alyson
shuffle. That was wonderful.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.490
All right, so here we go.
Here we go. Are you ready?

13:11.524 --> 13:15.961
All right, here we go.
Black or red, Alyson?

13:15.995 --> 13:17.897
- Black.
- Nice.

13:17.929 --> 13:18.898
- Yeah, look at this,
pretty good.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.099
Now, she had a 50-50 shot.

13:20.131 --> 13:21.667
We would expect
that kind of luck.

13:21.700 --> 13:22.768
But, Alyson,
that was very good.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.068
That's was very good.
Here we go.

13:24.102 --> 13:27.539
Next card.
Black or red?

13:27.572 --> 13:29.975
- Red.
[applause]

13:30.009 --> 13:31.243
- Have you ever done
this before?

13:31.277 --> 13:32.845
- No.
- This is amazing.

13:32.878 --> 13:34.580
Now twice in a row. I mean,
that could have been lucky.

13:34.613 --> 13:38.116
But still that's very good.
Here we go. Black or red?

13:38.149 --> 13:41.787
Alyson?
- Red.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.188
[applause]

13:43.221 --> 13:44.657
- Alyson, this is incredible.
Now, here's the thing.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.024
Alyson, did you have any idea

13:46.057 --> 13:47.293
you were gonna be
a part of this?

13:47.326 --> 13:48.427
- No.
- No, no, no.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.828
And that's part
of the rules, right?

13:49.861 --> 13:51.397
You can't--this isn't a setup.
But what would happen

13:51.429 --> 13:53.298
if I remove myself
from the equation?

13:53.331 --> 13:58.070
Alyson, next card,
black or red?

13:58.102 --> 13:59.804
- Oh.
- Just call it.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.173
- Black.
- Yes.

14:01.206 --> 14:03.008
And I love your instincts.
Will you do the honors?

14:03.042 --> 14:04.876
I don't want to touch it.
What did you say, black?

14:04.909 --> 14:05.878
- Oh.

14:05.910 --> 14:07.078
- Oh, okay.
[applause]

14:07.111 --> 14:08.147
All right, Alyson,
let's do another one.

14:08.179 --> 14:11.082
Black or red? Alyson?

14:11.115 --> 14:12.518
- Red.

14:12.551 --> 14:14.620
- There's only one way
to find out.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.054
Get out! This is incredible.
[applause]

14:16.087 --> 14:19.057
- Okay, Alyson, black or red?

14:19.091 --> 14:20.525
- Red.
- I'm freaking out too.

14:20.558 --> 14:22.727
[laughter]
You are doing amazing.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.397
Will you do the honors?
What do we got?

14:25.431 --> 14:27.265
- Oh!
- This is incredible! Okay.

14:27.298 --> 14:29.235
Black or red, Alyson?

14:29.268 --> 14:34.840
- Red.
- Okay. You said red. Yeah?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.808
- I don't...
[applause]

14:36.841 --> 14:39.544
Okay, Alyson.
You've never done this before?

14:39.577 --> 14:40.946
- No.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.147
- This might be one of
the greatest mentalism things

14:42.181 --> 14:44.015
ever,
and you're the one doing it.

14:44.048 --> 14:47.485
I'm merely a vessel.
Alyson, here's the thing.

14:47.519 --> 14:50.556
Why would you stop
at the color?

14:50.588 --> 14:54.793
Right? Suspense, Alyson.

14:54.826 --> 14:58.197
Suspense, suspense.
Black or red, Alyson?

14:58.230 --> 14:59.631
- Red.
- Red?

14:59.664 --> 15:04.602
- Yeah.
- Okay. Diamonds or hearts?

15:04.636 --> 15:06.171
- Diamonds.
- Okay?

15:06.205 --> 15:10.042
I like how you said diamonds.
It was almost evil. I love it.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.846
Okay, diamond. Number diamond
or letter diamond?

15:13.879 --> 15:15.547
- You know, number being
self-explanatory. Letter--

15:15.581 --> 15:17.950
yeah, you're an old hat
at this. Yeah.

15:17.982 --> 15:19.217
- Number.
- Number. Okay.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.120
Low number diamond
or high number diamond?

15:22.153 --> 15:23.187
- Low.

15:23.221 --> 15:24.657
- Low number diamond?
- Yeah.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.860
- That'll make this a two
diamonds, a three of diamonds,

15:27.893 --> 15:30.395
a four of diamonds,
a five of diamonds.

15:30.428 --> 15:32.298
I'll even throw in a six.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.667
- Two.
- Two of diamonds?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.735
Honestly, you claim
you've never done this before.

15:37.769 --> 15:41.539
That's your claim. Yeah?
Okay, here's--here's the thing.

15:41.572 --> 15:42.607
What was that the two
of diamonds?

15:42.640 --> 15:44.543
I put myself back
into the equation,

15:44.576 --> 15:46.010
I reintroduced the old problem.

15:46.044 --> 15:49.347
What would happen if Alyson
were completely on her own?

15:49.380 --> 15:51.716
Alyson, do you want
to mix up the cards any more?

15:51.750 --> 15:52.750
- Sure.

15:52.784 --> 15:54.052
- Yeah, I don't
trust you either.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.053
You're freaking me out.
This--yeah.

15:55.086 --> 15:56.721
- Let me just mix these.

15:56.754 --> 15:59.357
- Oh, oh. Okay.

15:59.390 --> 16:02.027
There's nothing disturbing
about any of this.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.928
[laughter]
You're doing great.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.931
Okay. Oh,
but you're very thorough.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.301
They always--they told me
that about you. Okay.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.702
- Did they?
- Yes, they did. Okay.

16:10.735 --> 16:15.640
So are you satisfied
they're mixed?

16:15.673 --> 16:17.442
The Alyson one-card burn,

16:17.475 --> 16:21.346
signature move,
you know, right?

16:21.379 --> 16:24.249
Alyson, Alyson,
will you spread out the cards?

16:24.283 --> 16:26.451
Yeah.
And will you touch any card?

16:26.485 --> 16:29.087
Yeah. Okay, get handsy.
That's cool.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.423
It's the finale? Why not?
Touch any card you wish.

16:31.456 --> 16:33.225
- Mmm. This one.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.326
- Do you want to change
your mind?

16:34.360 --> 16:35.727
- Sure.
- Yeah, I don't trust you.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.794
- That one.
- Okay.

16:36.828 --> 16:37.796
Do you want
to change your mind?

16:37.830 --> 16:38.998
- No.
- Keep it facedown,

16:39.030 --> 16:39.999
so we slide it to the side,
separate it

16:40.032 --> 16:43.235
from the rest of the deck.

16:43.268 --> 16:46.071
Okay, Alyson,
this is the one that you like?

16:46.105 --> 16:50.775
Okay, here we go.
Black or red?

16:50.808 --> 16:54.645
- Red.
- Red? Okay. Okay. Red.

16:54.679 --> 16:57.915
Is it hearts or is it diamonds?
- Hearts.

16:57.950 --> 17:02.254
- Is it--is it a number card
or a letter card?

17:02.287 --> 17:03.288
- Letter.
- Letter?

17:03.322 --> 17:04.890
Okay, yeah. That's cool.

17:04.923 --> 17:09.595
Letter card. That would
make this a jack of hearts,

17:09.627 --> 17:16.268
a queen of hearts,
a king of hearts, or an ace?

17:16.300 --> 17:18.202
- I'll go queen.
- You'll go queen? Oh, oh.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.438
- I'll go queen.

17:19.471 --> 17:22.473
- Okay. Okay, did you look
at this card?

17:22.508 --> 17:24.009
- Underneath? No. No.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.076
- Exactly.
Did you show it to me?

17:25.109 --> 17:26.244
- No.
- Did you show it to them?

17:26.278 --> 17:27.846
- No.
- If this is the queen

17:27.880 --> 17:30.982
of hearts you've done
the most amazing thing ever.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.451
No one's looked at this card
from a deck that you shuffled.

17:33.484 --> 17:34.920
But only if it's
the queen of hearts.

17:34.952 --> 17:37.388
Alyson, will you do the honors?

17:37.423 --> 17:40.325
And I'm nervous.
Will you show us first?

17:40.358 --> 17:45.029
- Show us first?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.266
Alyson, I don't know, you--

17:47.298 --> 17:48.366
[cheers and applause]

17:48.400 --> 17:51.103
- Micah, everyone!
[applause]

17:51.135 --> 17:52.604
Oh, my goodness.

17:52.637 --> 17:53.771
- You were incredible.

17:53.806 --> 17:57.375
- Oh. That was ridiculous.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.945
- Alyson, how long have
you been a magician?

18:00.979 --> 18:04.348
- Wait, we've reversed.
Are you trying to get my job?

18:04.383 --> 18:05.784
- I think you're trying
to get my job.

18:05.817 --> 18:07.286
[laughter]
- What would you say

18:07.318 --> 18:09.654
the number one talent
a magician needs?

18:09.688 --> 18:12.124
- I think going
with your feelings,

18:12.156 --> 18:14.125
going with your gut,
and trusting yourself.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.661
That's what you did tonight.

18:15.693 --> 18:19.597
- So what do you mean when you
say everyone has magic inside?

18:19.631 --> 18:20.898
- I think you just proved it.

18:20.932 --> 18:23.000
Everyone can do things
that they never thought

18:23.035 --> 18:25.037
they could do.
You had no idea

18:25.069 --> 18:27.405
you were gonna do this
at all until that moment.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.473
- Yeah.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.174
- And you knocked it
out of the park.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.910
- Why, thank you.
- Well, thank you.

18:31.943 --> 18:34.645
I can't guarantee everyone
will be as good as you.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.615
But it is proof that people
can make magic happen

18:37.648 --> 18:39.785
without even knowing
how they're doing it.

18:39.817 --> 18:42.753
And to me that is real magic.
- All right, Micah.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.655
Let's see if the boys
figured out your trick.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.491
- Fair enough.

18:46.525 --> 18:47.492
- Hey, Micah.
- Yeah.

18:47.526 --> 18:48.894
- What a great, great routine.

18:48.926 --> 18:50.061
- Thank you so much.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.597
- I mean, no hoo-ha,
no counting cards,

18:52.631 --> 18:56.801
no stacking, no false shuffles,
none of that jive.

18:56.835 --> 18:59.270
Just you want to see a miracle,
we got one for you.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.372
- Thank you.

19:00.404 --> 19:01.740
- And it was really,
really beautiful.

19:01.772 --> 19:03.241
We've seen tricks like this,

19:03.275 --> 19:06.278
but this is really a marked
improvement on a lot of them.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.212
Really, really nice
and beautiful.

19:08.247 --> 19:11.083
But, you know,
when I see something like this,

19:11.115 --> 19:13.152
it really makes me laugh and
you're a really funny person.

19:13.184 --> 19:16.555
- Thank you.
- I go back to--to my heroes

19:16.587 --> 19:19.023
of comedy who are known

19:19.057 --> 19:20.959
as Horwitz, Horwitz,
and Feinstein.

19:20.992 --> 19:22.059
You know who
I'm talking about?

19:22.094 --> 19:23.628
- I think I do.
- Now, Micah,

19:23.662 --> 19:26.565
I see you smiling right away,
'cause you're an aficionado.

19:26.597 --> 19:28.467
But for those who don't know
all about it,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.602
I'm talking about
The Three Stooges,

19:30.635 --> 19:33.672
Moe, Larry, and Curly.
And actually it was Shemp,

19:33.704 --> 19:35.406
and then he was replaced
by Curly,

19:35.440 --> 19:37.009
and that's when
the act changed.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.710
When Babe Horwitz came in,

19:38.743 --> 19:41.246
Curly Howard, they went
from tapping each other

19:41.279 --> 19:43.080
to really smacking each other.
[laughter]

19:43.115 --> 19:45.416
They--oh, yeah, they went from
tapping to smacking.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.852
- It's true.

19:46.884 --> 19:49.387
- And that's when "The
Three Stooges" really took off.

19:49.421 --> 19:50.689
- Yes.
- I gotta tell you,

19:50.721 --> 19:52.156
it was really, really great.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.926
No jive, just went there
and killed

19:54.960 --> 19:57.596
and blew Alyson's mind,
blew our mind.

19:57.628 --> 20:01.666
But I think maybe we have
a pretty good idea,

20:01.700 --> 20:04.936
and I think I snuck it to you
in some of the Feinstein there.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.438
What do you think?

20:06.471 --> 20:08.941
- So, Micah, do they know
how you made me a magician?

20:08.973 --> 20:11.210
- Yeah. I think they do.
But it was such a pleasure.

20:11.242 --> 20:12.310

My name is Cameron Young.

20:49.647 --> 20:50.915
And I've been
a close-up magician

20:50.949 --> 20:52.384

because I also became
Penn's daughter's magic coach.

Yes.
I used to teach Moxie Jillette.

21:53.111 --> 21:56.181
- When I was 14 years old

21:56.213 --> 21:58.950
I watched "Penn & Teller:
Fool Us" for the first time.

21:58.983 --> 22:02.287
And at that moment,
I fell in love with magic.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.256
There was three things
I realized.

22:04.288 --> 22:07.092
One, how much I loved magic.

22:07.125 --> 22:11.063
Two, how amazing it would be
to be in a double act.

22:11.096 --> 22:13.498
And three, I loved it

22:13.531 --> 22:16.468
when a magician
would do a dangerous stunt.

22:16.500 --> 22:21.373

these four pieces of string.

this fishing hook.

to meet my double act partner.

22:38.757 --> 22:42.661
- Yes, I have my very own
double act partner.

22:42.693 --> 22:48.165
The reason why I need a partner
is because I have four strings

22:48.200 --> 22:53.137
and a fishing hook in my mouth.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.374
Each of you are going
to command me

22:55.406 --> 22:59.211

each of the strings red,

23:02.881 --> 23:05.817
blue, green, and white.

23:05.851 --> 23:09.921

as a dangerous game of fishing,

a largemouth me.

dangerous tricks do you do?

I didn't fit in. Every weekend,

26:12.170 --> 26:14.271
I would be watching
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

what? This is for me.

a stunt artist.

you found your people?

someone came to us
with this trick and said,

"Do you guys want to do this?"
So they explained it all to us.

So from the moment we saw that
you didn't have a chance,

27:47.632 --> 27:51.836

had considered doing ourselves.

kind of stuck with me.

Magic was just
like medicine for me.

32:28.046 --> 32:30.781
It was kind of an escape,
you know, and allowed me

32:30.815 --> 32:35.153
to make friends, of course,
and defuse situations at times.

32:35.185 --> 32:36.887
But it was, I don't know,
always with me.

32:36.921 --> 32:38.890

in the back pocket.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.590

to have something

32:40.625 --> 32:41.759
you were passionate about.

32:41.792 --> 32:42.759

an amazing woman.

to thank her

32:46.897 --> 32:48.700

- Here you are.

32:48.732 --> 32:50.401
- So, Mom, thanks so much
for everything,

32:50.434 --> 32:52.804
all you sacrificed
to get me here.

32:52.836 --> 32:54.404
Definitely couldn't have
done it without you.

32:54.439 --> 32:56.307
- Do you mainly do
close-up magic?

32:56.340 --> 32:58.041
- I perform at a casino
in Wisconsin.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.876
So I would do stage show
maybe every six months

32:59.911 --> 33:03.146
and then would do strolling
throughout the casino.

33:03.181 --> 33:04.816
Yeah, I've been doing that
for almost nine years now.

33:04.848 --> 33:06.750
- Does the casino get
a little nervous

33:06.784 --> 33:10.020
at how good you are
at hiding money?

33:10.054 --> 33:11.622

with what I show them.

33:11.655 --> 33:13.057

33:13.090 --> 33:14.258
- Not a lot of
gambling routines.

33:14.291 --> 33:15.792
- They might be watching you
extra close

33:15.826 --> 33:17.494
after they see this episode.

33:17.528 --> 33:19.596
- You know, but they've gotten
to know me by now.

33:19.630 --> 33:20.798

33:20.832 --> 33:22.767

maybe somewhat trust me.

Well, let's see

fooled Penn and Teller.

at the beginning.

something back,

33:54.965 --> 33:56.800

33:56.834 --> 33:58.970
And we were lucky enough
to have him on the show.

33:59.002 --> 34:00.304
- Yeah.

34:00.337 --> 34:01.772
- And you wanted to do this
as a tribute to him.

34:01.806 --> 34:03.007
He would have loved you.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.042
- Man, yeah, I wish I got
to--to meet him.

34:05.076 --> 34:06.877
- Yeah, he would have
absolutely loved you,

34:06.911 --> 34:08.445

34:08.478 --> 34:11.114

just beautifully.

went to the one-handed thing,

I can't compliment you enough.

they do behind a big table,

34:30.768 --> 34:33.938

covers a multitude of sins.

love you more.

would have loved you.

34:48.686 --> 34:50.454

that you know.
