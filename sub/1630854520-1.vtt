WEBVTT

01:19.580 --> 01:20.706
Go! Get in!

03:11.608 --> 03:14.194
Apologies once more,
but due to equipment failure,

03:14.278 --> 03:16.822
this train will terminate at High Wycombe.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.241
The bus replacement service
will take you to Oxford Pathway,

03:19.324 --> 03:21.493
where you can proceed to your journey.

03:21.577 --> 03:22.578
Thank you.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.163
Remaining passengers
arriving from Marylebone,

04:06.246 --> 04:10.209
the bus replacement service offers
a pathway available from the car park.

04:10.292 --> 04:13.253
It's just this way.
The bus replacement service.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.424
Run with your head down!

05:49.224 --> 05:50.559
Hey, we're here.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.188
Christ's sake.

05:59.276 --> 06:02.112
Come on, mate. Wake up for God's sake!

07:29.449 --> 07:31.243
Welcome to High Wycombe.

07:31.326 --> 07:34.872
The train currently
standing at platform two…

07:35.914 --> 07:40.085
…Bicester Village,
Oxford Parkway, and Oxford.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.307
Yeah, mate, I'm not working that day.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.350
They're expecting 100,000 people.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.102
The toilets are gonna be like a barn.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.980
Mate,
there is no way I'm working that day.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.315
Hang on.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.860
-Can I help?
-Yes.

08:04.943 --> 08:08.739
I'm wondering if you could tell me
where I might find the replacement buses.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.408
We don't have any today.
Everything's running.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.577
So, listen,
you tell Head Office, yeah--

08:15.662 --> 08:17.748
I need the bus because--

08:17.831 --> 08:20.709
Well, the other night my brother passed.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.586
I don't know whether you heard.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.213
Yeah--

08:24.296 --> 08:26.507
Hey, mate,
I'm gonna call you back, yeah?

08:27.466 --> 08:30.093
Yes, I did. My condolences.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.554
The buses are run
by a separate company.

08:32.638 --> 08:35.599
Well, perhaps you could
give me the name of the company.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.727
We use different ones. I'm not sure--

08:38.809 --> 08:44.399
Please. I-- I would very much like to see
the place from where he left this earth.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.736
All right--

08:49.613 --> 08:52.866
Let me make a few phone calls,
and I'll see if I can sort you out.

08:53.825 --> 08:54.826
Okay.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.259
Standish.

09:56.555 --> 09:57.848
This isn't working.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.933
Can you be more specific?

10:00.017 --> 10:02.561
Seniority dictates
I should have my own office.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.564
I wouldn't take length of service
in this shithole as a status symbol.

10:05.647 --> 10:06.815
Prisoners have hierarchies.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.901
Humans organize themselves
according to power.

10:08.984 --> 10:11.111
I'll be down shortly with today's work.

10:11.195 --> 10:14.740
Hurry up. If you don't give me
something to do, I'm gonna kill him.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.450
Or at least maim him.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.002
Morning.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.357
Has anyone seen Lamb?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.779
Ambulance driver said
it was a heart attack.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.822
Mercifully quick.

10:56.657 --> 10:59.868
Here one moment,
the next, with the angels.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.956
Found him down there,
second from the back.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.500
And I thought he was sleeping.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.295
Well, he was, wasn't he?

11:14.383 --> 11:18.136
Was there anything
out of the ordinary?

11:19.388 --> 11:20.597
Apart from him.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.725
Anything near him?

11:24.226 --> 11:26.687
Something he might've left?

11:26.770 --> 11:28.897
There was a hat. Seat next to him.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.691
Oh, well, that could well have been his.

11:30.774 --> 11:34.278
Could I take a look at it?
Be lovely to have a keepsake.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.029
Sure, it'd be in lost property.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.033
I'll go by when I'm done here.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.413
He looked quite calm-like. Your brother.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.292
Well, that's how he would've wanted to go.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.129
He liked buses.

11:54.381 --> 11:59.011
It's not that I believe
in a life-force, precisely.

12:00.762 --> 12:03.974
But I'm not positive
I don't believe in one.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.269
If you take my meaning.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.523
I'll-- I'll give you a moment.

12:50.729 --> 12:53.649
-Sorry to bother, but--
-Oh, yes.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.025
Will you be much longer?

12:57.861 --> 12:58.862
I've--

13:00.739 --> 13:04.034
I-- I've said my-- my final good-byes.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.371
Only we've just had a call.
Gonna need to use the bus.

13:08.622 --> 13:09.623
Of course.

13:23.971 --> 13:24.972
Fuck.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.740
Has anyone seen River?

13:44.783 --> 13:48.036
Yeah, I'm just really excited to take what
I've learned in government intelligence

13:48.120 --> 13:50.956
and apply it a bit more
to more concentrated, commercial--

13:51.456 --> 13:53.166
Taking what I've learned
in government intelligence

13:53.250 --> 13:56.962
and applying it to more commercial,
targeted goals. It's something that I've…

13:57.045 --> 13:58.797
They are ready for you now,
Mr. Cartwright.

14:03.760 --> 14:08.015
And actually, now, at a time
of real geopolitical uncertainty,

14:08.098 --> 14:12.519
private intelligence can fill
the gaps left by the national agencies.

14:12.603 --> 14:13.729
You know?

14:13.812 --> 14:15.063
Absolutely.

14:15.147 --> 14:18.442
And it-- it feels to me, actually,
that those are the really interesting,

14:18.525 --> 14:22.905
and often unorthodox areas of fieldwork
to which I'm probably best suited.

14:22.988 --> 14:24.114
Now, on your CV,

14:24.198 --> 14:27.701
it says that you're currently seconded
to a unit near Aldersgate.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.454
Yes, I am. Yes.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.664
It's a bespoke unit.

14:32.748 --> 14:36.418
Deals more in analog methods
of intelligence gathering

14:36.502 --> 14:39.880
that's actually given me
a real grounding in more database--

14:39.963 --> 14:44.885
Yeah, and-- That's great.
So you work at Slough House?

14:46.261 --> 14:47.262
Yes.

14:48.055 --> 14:51.433
I understand that it's not everyone's
first choice of assignment, I do.

14:51.517 --> 14:54.520
But actually, I've found it invaluable.

14:54.603 --> 14:56.104
So you work with Jackson Lamb?

14:57.981 --> 14:59.191
Yeah.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.484
What's he like?

15:07.741 --> 15:10.077
Where is everyone?

15:16.458 --> 15:18.377
Oh, Min, please can you sit down?

15:19.461 --> 15:21.922
Sorry, it's just that I'm trying
to get my steps in.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.383
I should never have given you that thing.

15:28.262 --> 15:29.680
Well, Lamb's gonna kill us.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.890
No, it's fine.
He wasn't even in this morning.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.643
Yeah. He's probably off
wanking in a morgue somewhere.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.855
Okay. What about this one?

15:42.818 --> 15:44.027
300.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.112
300?

15:45.904 --> 15:46.905
Min, it's got a garden.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.156
Okay, 310 then.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.410
I mean it's--
What, it's a "garden flat in Leytonstone."

15:51.493 --> 15:52.619
It can't be that much.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.872
-520.
-Oh, my god.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.123
I mean, that's a lot.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.583
-It's not.
-He's here.

16:04.673 --> 16:05.966
Here we go.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.092
It's gonna be fun.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.640
All right. Let's make this quick.

16:14.433 --> 16:15.809
I'm seconding you.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.228
Not for long, week or so.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.480
So you'll be reporting to me.

16:21.190 --> 16:22.441
On what sort of job?

16:22.983 --> 16:24.318
Security.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.777
For an off-the-books meeting.

16:26.278 --> 16:28.614
Oh, okay. So that's why we're meeting here
and not the Park.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.783
Yeah. And because you're not allowed
in the building.

16:32.284 --> 16:33.577
Who's the meeting between?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.078
Myself and Arkady Pashkin.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.164
Representative of Ilya Nevsky.

16:37.831 --> 16:38.832
The oligarch?

16:38.916 --> 16:40.375
Nah, the kid's puppeteer.

16:40.876 --> 16:42.085
Yeah, the oligarch.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.088
But I thought we were supposed
to stay away from him.

16:46.298 --> 16:47.925
You're supposed
to stay away from everyone, Min.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.928
I meant "we" as in MI5. He's a dissident.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.722
He opposes a regime in Moscow,
and we're not supposed to take sides.

16:53.805 --> 16:57.518
Well, Her Majesty's Government are
prepared to be pragmatic in this matter.

16:58.018 --> 17:01.772
Nevsky made his money in oil and gas.
We're worried about energy security.

17:01.855 --> 17:06.484
So, Nevsky's right-hand guy, Pashkin,
Taverner's right-hand guy, moi,

17:07.027 --> 17:09.570
are gonna sherpa a little meeting
between the two of them.

17:10.321 --> 17:14.742
Any face-to-face meetings are to
be held at a pre-agreed secure location

17:14.826 --> 17:16.578
which I need you to assess, sweep,

17:17.454 --> 17:19.122
take out the bins. Usual routine.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.040
Well, who made the approach?

17:21.124 --> 17:24.962
Pashkin. Via an intermediary.
Freelancer named Krimov.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.797
And does Krimov check out?

17:28.173 --> 17:30.843
I did the background. It's all in here.

17:34.513 --> 17:37.391
So, the meeting's this Saturday
in the Glasshouse.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.434
Same day as the Anti-Capitalist March.

17:39.518 --> 17:43.355
Is that a problem? Are you thinking
of making a placard and going along?

17:43.438 --> 17:45.357
No, no. Just getting up to speed.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.277
Good.
Well, I hope it's not too tall an order.

17:49.361 --> 17:50.821
But if you think you're too rusty

17:50.904 --> 17:53.866
or you're happy with the stale scraps
Lamb throws you, just say the word…

17:54.867 --> 17:56.451
and piss off back to Slough House.

17:57.369 --> 18:00.414
-Should we take the job?
-I think we just did.

18:00.497 --> 18:04.042
Well, yeah, I know. But Lamb's gonna
cough up a bollock when he finds out.

18:04.126 --> 18:07.087
-Well, we don't really have a choice.
-Well, we do. We can just not do it.

18:07.838 --> 18:09.339
Thing is, you're scared of Lamb.

18:10.382 --> 18:11.675
I'm not scared of Lamb.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.554
I mean, yeah, I am scared of Lamb. Yeah.

18:18.307 --> 18:21.935
You're looking at it.
I did what you asked without being asked.

18:22.019 --> 18:25.397
Be great if you could do that
without making me want to hit you.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.858
-Just don't say anything.
-Yes, okay.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.154
-What am I looking at?
-Soho street cam footage.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.239
This is Soho?

18:34.323 --> 18:37.242
But where's all the prostitutes
and the junkies?

18:37.326 --> 18:38.994
-Soho's changed.
-Shut up, Mike.

18:39.077 --> 18:40.329
Marcus.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.539
Yeah, it'll take me six months
to get your name right,

18:42.623 --> 18:45.083
and if I've done my job,
you'll be long gone by then.

18:45.167 --> 18:49.004
It looks like he's heading for
Marylebone. Can you pick him up there?

19:04.561 --> 19:06.146
Where's he gone? We lost him.

19:06.230 --> 19:08.440
We just need to switch to another camera.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.443
-Cause of death?
-What's going on?

19:11.527 --> 19:14.154
Ex-service agent found dead
on a bus in Oxford Parkway.

19:14.238 --> 19:15.739
Just got the coroner's report.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.907
Guy!

19:17.699 --> 19:18.700
Heart failure.

19:19.535 --> 19:20.702
That's bollocks.

19:20.786 --> 19:24.081
Well, he was in his 60s, smoked,
drank. Was probably on the cards.

19:24.164 --> 19:28.043
But I do all that and look at me.
I'm in my prime.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.379
Why would someone wanna kill this guy?

19:30.462 --> 19:33.465
Maybe he went for a job interview
without telling his boss.

19:33.549 --> 19:35.175
That's grounds for murder.

19:36.593 --> 19:37.845
Are you sure it's murder?

19:37.928 --> 19:40.639
He left a note on his phone
that tells me it was.

19:41.849 --> 19:42.975
And you gonna tell us
what it says?

19:43.058 --> 19:46.186
Yeah, well, I would if I thought
you could offer up any insights.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.522
Here's an angle by the ticket barriers.

19:53.819 --> 19:55.904
Dickie goes through
the barrier without buying a ticket.

19:55.988 --> 19:58.907
-So it's not a planned journey.
-Yeah, rewind.

19:58.991 --> 20:01.076
-Dickie?
-His real name was Richard Bough.

20:01.159 --> 20:04.413
He was an occasional in Berlin.
Kicked out just before the wall came down.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.749
He's following someone.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.753
I wanna see them getting on
the buses at High Wycombe station.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.301
Well, hang on. That-- That bus is closer,
but he walks over to that one.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.052
I think he's following the man in the hat.

20:19.136 --> 20:22.139
Well, this hat was found near where
Dickie snuffed it in the luggage rack.

20:22.222 --> 20:26.476
Ladies and gentlemen, the death bus is
now pulling into Oxford Parkway station.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.898
Well, there's no one in a hat.

20:31.732 --> 20:34.359
That's because the hat was left
on the fucking bus, you pillock.

20:34.443 --> 20:35.819
I'm holding it.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.698
Just show me the footage
from both platforms.

20:41.325 --> 20:42.784
It's the bald man.

20:42.868 --> 20:43.869
Which bald man?

20:43.952 --> 20:45.996
Center of screen,
on the northbound platform.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.415
He's got his back to the camera.
He doesn't want to be seen.

20:52.377 --> 20:53.837
Where did your bald man go?

20:53.921 --> 20:54.922
Must've got on the train.

20:55.005 --> 20:58.509
No, he's still on the platform.
Fast-forward to the next train, Roddy.

21:06.892 --> 21:11.230
Right. I want footage
from inside that Oxford Parkway train,

21:11.313 --> 21:13.899
so we can see where baldy gets off, okay?

21:13.982 --> 21:17.277
I wanna know who this fucker is
and where he fucking went.

21:17.361 --> 21:19.488
Footage from inside
the trains is stored on hard drives

21:19.571 --> 21:22.533
that are physically swapped out once
a week and are taken to a data center.

21:22.616 --> 21:24.910
I just fell asleep with my eyes open.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.996
Where they're copied and wiped,
then put back on the trains.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.331
It's legwork.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.667
You need a donkey for that,
and I'm a thoroughbred.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.962
You, Ho, are a massive horse's cock.

21:35.045 --> 21:38.215
But you're right. I need a donkey
to fetch those hard drives.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.299
Harper.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.719
You see that?

21:42.803 --> 21:43.971
-See what?
-No.

21:44.054 --> 21:47.057
Harper just shared a little look
with his girlfriend.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.517
I wonder what that means.

21:49.518 --> 21:51.186
We've been seconded.

21:51.270 --> 21:53.021
Who by? Twats "R" Us?

21:54.064 --> 21:55.691
-Webb.
-What-- Webb?

21:55.774 --> 21:57.860
You're gonna work for that dick
after he fucked me over?

21:57.943 --> 22:00.404
I don't know.
I think it shows excellent taste.

22:00.487 --> 22:04.783
What's the assignment, and please tell me
you can't give me any details?

22:05.659 --> 22:07.995
Security on a Russian back channel meet.

22:08.078 --> 22:09.079
Jesus Christ, Min.

22:09.162 --> 22:12.165
You were what,
549th on the list?

22:12.249 --> 22:16.712
You know, if it was anyone else
I'd go nuclear bananas, but I hate Webb,

22:16.795 --> 22:20.132
and you will doubtless fuck it up,
so I consider that a result.

22:20.215 --> 22:23.760
I'll get the hard drives then.
They're too busy working for the enemy.

22:23.844 --> 22:26.180
Fuck off.
You're planning to jump ship for Elessar.

22:26.263 --> 22:28.682
Don't grandstand when you're
chasing the private pound.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.184
Where the fuck are you going?

22:32.060 --> 22:33.478
I turned them down.
I didn't want to do it.

22:33.562 --> 22:35.981
Well, we just sorted out
your farewell present.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.065
Here.

22:37.983 --> 22:39.902
What am I supposed to do with this now?

22:41.236 --> 22:42.988
I'm not giving you any juicy action.

22:43.071 --> 22:46.575
I'm still laboring under the illusion
that Shelby…

22:46.658 --> 22:47.659
Shirley.

22:47.743 --> 22:50.162
…is only half shit and not full shit
like everyone else.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.246
So she's going.

22:51.330 --> 22:53.999
But why risk her when you know
I could do the job?

22:54.666 --> 22:57.169
Sorry, it's just this is in my wheelhouse.
I don't know what we're--

22:57.252 --> 22:59.254
-You have a wheelhouse?
-Yes, I do have a wheelhouse.

22:59.338 --> 23:03.175
Do you know why she's at Slough House?

23:03.258 --> 23:04.426
No.

23:04.510 --> 23:06.970
Well, consider yourself lucky
you stopped when you did.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.598
Wait, so what do I do then?

23:09.681 --> 23:12.684
Fuck off to the job center for all I care.

23:34.623 --> 23:36.583
You can think about getting a gardener.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.585
Too much for you?

23:38.669 --> 23:40.087
No, I'm just saying, you know.

23:41.255 --> 23:43.340
Maybe someone
to do stuff around the house too.

23:44.883 --> 23:46.176
If this is leading towards,

23:46.260 --> 23:47.761
"You'd be better off in a home,"

23:47.845 --> 23:51.306
I think I should warn you
I once killed a man with a pair of shears.

23:54.685 --> 23:55.769
Wait, really?

23:55.853 --> 23:58.230
No, but it's never too late.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.442
How did the interview go?

24:03.360 --> 24:04.903
Jesus Christ.

24:06.071 --> 24:09.074
God, spooks never do retire, do they?
How did you know that?

24:09.783 --> 24:11.743
The director got in touch with me.

24:12.452 --> 24:15.747
I said you'd prefer to be judged
on your own merits.

24:17.332 --> 24:20.002
Well, I was and I didn't get it.
So that's nice to know.

24:20.085 --> 24:23.213
I think they just got me in
to hear stories about Lamb anyway.

24:23.297 --> 24:25.841
I can't see you in private intelligence.

24:25.924 --> 24:28.218
Well, luckily neither can
the people in private intelligence

24:28.302 --> 24:29.720
because to them I'm still the dickhead

24:29.803 --> 24:32.014
who crashed Stansted
on a training exercise.

24:34.558 --> 24:36.351
I thought saving Hassan
would wipe the slate clean,

24:36.435 --> 24:39.146
but I'm still sat around
like a spare part.

24:40.105 --> 24:41.940
Well, something will turn up.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.194
Already has,
but Lamb's shut me out of that one too.

24:45.777 --> 24:47.613
Tracking an FSB wet squad.

24:47.696 --> 24:48.697
Who is the hit?

24:48.780 --> 24:50.199
Richard Bough.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.326
Christ.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.244
What?

24:55.579 --> 24:56.955
Oh, nothing. I'm just--

24:58.498 --> 25:00.876
I'm amazed he was still alive, is all.

25:02.127 --> 25:03.462
How did he die?

25:04.546 --> 25:06.798
Heart attack. On paper.

25:06.882 --> 25:09.384
Well, maybe it was just a heart attack.

25:09.927 --> 25:13.388
I mean, I don't see anyone wanting
to have Dickie Bough killed.

25:15.057 --> 25:16.391
Wait, so you knew him?

25:17.017 --> 25:18.477
Yeah, of him. Yeah.

25:19.686 --> 25:20.687
God.

25:23.482 --> 25:26.193
Come on. I need a drink for all this.

26:22.958 --> 26:24.001
Shit. Sorry.

26:24.084 --> 26:25.252
No worries.

26:38.265 --> 26:40.559
-Someone dropped this.
-Thank you.

26:48.984 --> 26:50.027
Yeah?

26:50.110 --> 26:53.030
I need you to cut the power
to the Datalok building at nine o'clock.

26:53.530 --> 26:56.408
-I've got a date in 30 minutes.
-No, you haven't.

26:56.491 --> 26:59.703
I just lifted a security guy's card, and
I need to get in there before he notices.

27:00.204 --> 27:02.497
Why do you need me to cut the power
if you've already got his card?

27:02.581 --> 27:04.041
It only gets me through the outer gate.

27:04.124 --> 27:06.418
It's facial recognition
on the door to the building.

27:07.419 --> 27:08.420
What's in it for me?

27:09.296 --> 27:10.797
A quick death.

27:22.017 --> 27:23.227
Cicadas.

27:24.811 --> 27:27.439
Sleeper agents embedded
in British society.

27:27.523 --> 27:30.984
So named because cicadas
spend years underground before hatching.

27:31.068 --> 27:34.404
And do you remember
how we concluded they were a hoax?

27:34.488 --> 27:36.573
Yes.
Because the spy master controlling them

27:36.657 --> 27:37.950
turned out to be a bogeyman, yeah.

27:38.033 --> 27:42.037
Alexander Popov.
My fearsome opposite number.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.790
Invented by the Russians
to keep us chasing our tails.

27:44.873 --> 27:46.166
Yeah, well.

27:46.250 --> 27:50.420
Dickie's big moment came when he
went AWOL before the wall came down.

27:50.504 --> 27:53.298
We thought he'd defected, and,

27:53.382 --> 27:56.134
to be frank,
the Germans were welcome to him.

27:57.135 --> 28:00.556
And then he came staggering back,
blind drunk,

28:00.639 --> 28:04.142
claiming that Popov
and a thug had abducted him

28:04.226 --> 28:07.688
and interrogated him
and poured brandy down his throat.

28:08.355 --> 28:11.316
I mean, obviously he'd been
on an enormous bender.

28:12.150 --> 28:15.571
And he came up with the worst
possible excuse imaginable.

28:16.154 --> 28:17.406
So we threw him out.

28:19.324 --> 28:22.536
Right, so there's no chance that Dickie
was actually telling the truth then?

28:23.203 --> 28:25.539
None. I mean, Popov was a ghost.

28:25.622 --> 28:27.791
We never found a single cicada.

28:27.875 --> 28:30.085
Well, it's definitely
getting Lamb worked up.

28:30.169 --> 28:33.589
Well, he's probably
doing due diligence on an old joe, but…

28:34.756 --> 28:37.968
you know, Dickie's death
was nothing out of the ordinary.

28:39.845 --> 28:41.680
He was following someone when he died.

28:42.306 --> 28:43.891
Maybe he saw someone
that he shouldn't have.

28:43.974 --> 28:45.392
No, in Berlin.

28:45.475 --> 28:47.144
And then now again in London.

28:47.227 --> 28:48.854
Look, I know you had a knock-back today

28:48.937 --> 28:50.689
and you're desperate
for something to happen.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.150
But believe me,
this doesn't sound like anything.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.234
Why not?

28:54.318 --> 28:57.196
Well, heart failure
isn't the FSB's style, is it?

28:57.279 --> 29:00.449
I mean, all their recent hits
have left a clear signature.

29:00.532 --> 29:02.284
Usually radioactive.

29:03.202 --> 29:05.412
No, they want us to see what they've done

29:06.538 --> 29:10.000
and dare us to come up
with a response that will never happen.

29:10.501 --> 29:12.669
-But what if this isn't the FSB?
-What?

29:13.212 --> 29:15.130
-What if it's KGB?
-Oh. No, no.

29:16.006 --> 29:17.841
Now you're chasing after your own tail.

29:17.925 --> 29:20.469
Yeah, I mean,
those guys, they left no trace.

29:20.552 --> 29:23.680
You wouldn't see them coming.
Brush past, a tap from an umbrella…

29:23.764 --> 29:26.558
No, no, no.
Dickie wasn't bothering anyone.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.479
Yeah. Maybe not.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.234
Right, I better go.

29:35.317 --> 29:38.278
Can I not offer you dinner?

29:38.362 --> 29:40.572
No. It's fine. I had something before.

29:41.281 --> 29:42.616
I'll clean all that up.

29:42.699 --> 29:46.161
No. Leave it. I'll do it later.
I enjoy the night air.

29:47.913 --> 29:49.081
Be careful, River.

29:52.251 --> 29:53.627
What made you say that?

29:55.295 --> 29:57.714
There's a streetlight out
at the end of the lane.

29:58.549 --> 30:01.635
There's a dark stretch between there
and the high street.

30:03.262 --> 30:07.266
Right. Don't drink too much.

30:36.461 --> 30:40.048
Right. This is the Glasshouse
where Webb has agreed to meet Pashkin.

30:40.132 --> 30:42.801
The entrance to the underground car park
is on the street behind.

30:44.344 --> 30:46.305
And then, for the meeting, we take a lift

30:46.388 --> 30:49.016
up to the boardroom
and disable the cameras.

30:49.099 --> 30:51.727
So we need to do a bug sweep
the night before.

30:51.810 --> 30:53.812
We could check it out now.
I bet the view's amazing.

30:53.896 --> 30:56.106
No. We can't get access
until Webb gives us passes.

30:56.190 --> 30:57.608
Or we just use the building opposite.

30:57.691 --> 30:59.943
Have a roofnic.
Scope it out from there.

31:00.027 --> 31:01.612
-Roofnic?
-Yeah.

31:02.571 --> 31:05.532
How come Lamb knew
about River's interview?

31:05.616 --> 31:08.660
Catherine said
that they called in for a reference.

31:09.161 --> 31:11.246
Fuck. Brutal.

31:11.747 --> 31:13.957
So what, did he just fart
down the phone?

31:14.041 --> 31:16.043
No. Apparently,
it was actually pretty good.

31:16.126 --> 31:17.794
-Really?
-Yeah.

31:20.547 --> 31:22.382
Pashkin is gonna meet Webb
in the boardroom

31:22.466 --> 31:25.552
above Nevsky's office
which is on the 42nd floor.

31:26.053 --> 31:28.055
Does that say… Almaz Trust?

31:28.680 --> 31:30.015
Nevsky's company.

31:30.891 --> 31:34.770
It's Russian for diamonds.
Made his first million as a gem trader.

31:37.731 --> 31:41.485
So, 42nd floor would be one, two, three,

31:41.568 --> 31:45.113
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
11, 12--

31:45.197 --> 31:47.115
Min, just count down from the top.

31:47.199 --> 31:49.868
It's 50 floors, boardroom's 47th floor,
Nevsky's five down from that--

31:49.952 --> 31:52.329
All right. Okay. Yeah.
I can do the maths, yeah.

31:53.205 --> 31:55.999
That's why he wants to have
the meeting in this building then?

31:56.083 --> 31:58.043
Yeah.
Once we establish the boardroom's secure,

31:58.126 --> 32:00.629
you can just sneak upstairs
and no one will ever know.

32:00.712 --> 32:03.590
Yeah. And it's not like anyone's going
to be looking through the windows, is it?

32:04.091 --> 32:05.551
What's above and below?

32:06.593 --> 32:07.636
Nothing above.

32:08.637 --> 32:11.348
Below, apart from Nevsky's,
there are private banks,

32:11.431 --> 32:15.644
investment companies,
and then 20 floors of luxury hotel.

32:16.311 --> 32:19.398
Well, maybe we should insist
on staying in the hotel as part of the op.

32:19.481 --> 32:20.691
Should we make that a deal breaker?

32:20.774 --> 32:22.234
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

33:27.508 --> 33:29.801
You are a fucking dead man, Ho.

33:30.344 --> 33:31.595
I said nine o'clock!

33:46.693 --> 33:47.945
Fuck.

34:29.319 --> 34:33.031
I only realized when I got home.
She lifted my wallet and handed it in.

34:33.114 --> 34:36.201
The card was gone. Fucking crazy.

35:42.684 --> 35:43.894
You go that way.

36:51.461 --> 36:53.255
-So did you get it?
-Yep.

36:55.632 --> 36:56.633
Good job.

36:57.885 --> 36:59.720
Guess I'm not full shit then?

36:59.803 --> 37:01.805
Oh, no. Definitely not full shit.

37:01.889 --> 37:04.057
Yeah. Full shit be crashing Stansted.

37:05.392 --> 37:08.353
Well, actually that was a setup,
so it-- Forget it.

37:10.230 --> 37:12.733
So you're here for--
Is it punching your case officer?

37:13.525 --> 37:14.693
Technically, no.

37:15.444 --> 37:17.529
I mean, I did punch him
after he made a pass at me,

37:17.613 --> 37:20.407
but I could've escaped that
with a reprimand and a note in my file.

37:21.033 --> 37:24.494
It was the second punch that did it,
after he said I hit like a girl.

37:25.162 --> 37:26.413
Didn't get up after that.

37:28.540 --> 37:29.833
Fair enough.

37:32.419 --> 37:36.507
He took a train from Oxford Parkway
to Stroud, Cotswolds.

37:39.176 --> 37:40.511
I checked the station CCTV.

37:40.594 --> 37:43.013
Our guy walks off camera
towards the taxi booth.

37:43.805 --> 37:45.974
Right. So we don't know
where he went after that?

37:47.601 --> 37:51.063
It's gonna sound strange, but did
anyone come near Dickie with an umbrella?

37:51.146 --> 37:52.439
Yeah. Loads of people.

37:52.523 --> 37:54.566
-It was raining earlier.
-Yeah, no. I meant--

37:54.650 --> 37:56.735
You meant like
in the Markov assassination.

37:56.818 --> 37:57.819
Yeah.

37:57.903 --> 38:00.989
Got a big wide-on for old-school hits,
but no one jabbed him with an umbrella.

38:03.742 --> 38:04.952
What about the bald man?

38:05.452 --> 38:07.871
Told you, we lose him at the taxi booths.

38:08.580 --> 38:10.666
Yeah, but how close did he get to Dickie?

38:29.518 --> 38:30.727
That seat's taken.

38:30.811 --> 38:32.521
Oh, yeah? By who?

38:32.604 --> 38:34.481
Gillian Anderson's in the lav.

38:35.107 --> 38:37.860
Well, I imagine she'll be a while
throwing up after watching you eat.

38:42.447 --> 38:47.244
Do you know how much it hurt me to
write you an even half-decent reference?

38:48.287 --> 38:51.039
And all for nothing.
I mean, you're still here.

38:51.790 --> 38:55.502
What you do, take a shit in the wastepaper
bin halfway through the interview?

38:55.586 --> 38:58.714
Actually, what went wrong was not having
anything interesting to say about you.

38:58.797 --> 39:01.216
Should've just told them
that you eat like a dying horse.

39:03.093 --> 39:05.387
It's my fault
no one wants to hire you?

39:08.974 --> 39:10.517
Dickie was murdered.

39:10.601 --> 39:11.977
I know that, you twat.

39:12.060 --> 39:13.520
Yes, but you don't know how.

39:15.022 --> 39:16.023
If you…

39:18.567 --> 39:19.943
Can I sit there or I'm gonna--

39:20.027 --> 39:21.028
I can't.

39:25.908 --> 39:28.744
Shirley got that footage
that you asked for from inside the train.

39:30.370 --> 39:31.371
So, look.

39:33.665 --> 39:35.209
Dickie's nearest the door, right?

39:35.292 --> 39:38.504
Meaning that he has to get off first if he
doesn't want to draw attention to himself.

39:38.587 --> 39:41.507
But what that means is that it puts
the man that he's following behind him

39:41.590 --> 39:43.008
when they get off at High Wycombe.

39:43.091 --> 39:45.677
But look. He's touching Dickie on the arm.

39:46.220 --> 39:49.473
And then, if you go to the footage
from inside the station…

39:52.100 --> 39:53.477
Dickie's rubbing his arm.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.938
Our man must have dosed him
with something untraceable

39:56.021 --> 39:57.481
that shows up as a heart attack.

39:58.607 --> 40:00.025
Unless you want to run a bunch of

40:00.108 --> 40:02.486
complicated and obscure tests,
which I imagine the Park

40:02.569 --> 40:04.863
wouldn't want to bother with
even if they thought it necessary.

40:04.947 --> 40:06.198
Now…

40:08.575 --> 40:12.496
I bet you 50 quid that I know
the message on Dickie's phone.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.081
Just one word.

40:15.123 --> 40:16.166
Cicada.

40:40.566 --> 40:41.567
Not bad.

40:42.943 --> 40:44.653
What, my pitch or your noodles?

40:46.113 --> 40:47.364
Yeah. Keep the change.

40:47.447 --> 40:48.866
Thank you, Mr. Lamb.

40:50.325 --> 40:52.578
You know, the fact
that I'm right means you give me 50 quid.

40:52.661 --> 40:54.663
I mean, that's how bets work, generally.

40:55.455 --> 40:58.250
Well, I'll take it as a fee
for writing your reference.

41:00.502 --> 41:04.047
Okay, clever bollocks, what's it all mean?

41:05.424 --> 41:08.468
What it means is that Dickie
wasn't lying all those years ago.

41:09.303 --> 41:11.388
It means he was grabbed,
force-fed a ton of booze

41:11.471 --> 41:14.558
and then questioned by someone
wanting to spread the myth of Popov.

41:17.477 --> 41:18.937
It's still a myth.

41:19.021 --> 41:21.899
Yes, Popov didn't exist,
but maybe the cicadas did.

41:21.982 --> 41:25.235
Do. Maybe they hid the truth in a lie.

41:26.486 --> 41:28.780
And Dickie has seen someone,
he's tailed them,

41:28.864 --> 41:30.908
they've not liked it
so they've killed him.

41:30.991 --> 41:34.703
Because maybe they've been reactivated
and maybe more people are gonna die.

41:52.596 --> 41:53.597
Where are you off to?

41:55.098 --> 41:56.517
Cotswolds.

41:58.644 --> 41:59.645
Good.

42:00.395 --> 42:02.481
Find out what the bald man did there,

42:03.190 --> 42:05.943
who he spoke to, and if he's still there.

42:07.819 --> 42:08.820
Yeah.

42:18.163 --> 42:19.331
Cheers, Mr. Lao.

42:21.166 --> 42:24.086
Can I get a couple
of those prawn buns to go?
