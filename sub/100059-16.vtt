WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:06.136
- For anyone who hasn't
already downloaded

00:06.180 --> 00:08.356
the Zephra employee app,
you need to.

00:08.399 --> 00:09.748
There's a bunch
of cool features.

00:09.792 --> 00:12.055
For one, you get points
for helping customers--

00:12.099 --> 00:13.143
- Ooh, I want points.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.623
- Ooh, me too.
- What do points do?

00:14.666 --> 00:16.233
- Looks like ten points
get you a badge,

00:16.277 --> 00:17.582
and ten badges
get you a banner.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.193
- Ooh.
- And what do banners get you?

00:19.236 --> 00:20.542
- I don't know, Jonah,
the moon.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.413
God, ten times a day
with this guy.

00:22.457 --> 00:23.719
"What do banners get you?"

00:23.762 --> 00:25.112
- It also uses your
location data

00:25.155 --> 00:26.461
to automatically clock you in

00:26.504 --> 00:27.853
when you enter the store,
so no need to swipe in

00:27.897 --> 00:29.507
in the mornings anymore.
- Really?

00:29.551 --> 00:31.727
Hello,
extra half-hour of sleep!

00:31.770 --> 00:33.511
- Extra half-hour?
Glenn, what is your

00:33.555 --> 00:36.079
clock-in process?
- Oh, it's very involved.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.516
- Can we all talk about whether
it's an invasion of privacy

00:38.560 --> 00:40.344
for Zephra to force us
to download something

00:40.388 --> 00:41.780
that can track our phones?

00:41.824 --> 00:43.391
- Do we have to?
- Who cares?

00:43.434 --> 00:44.783
- No, thank you.
- That's kinda boring.

00:44.827 --> 00:45.958
- That's what every app does.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.351
- Great debate, guys.
It's very useful.

00:47.395 --> 00:50.224
- Also there's a product
locator, an inventory map,

00:50.267 --> 00:52.356
and, uh, oh--
your Z-Shelf comes with

00:52.400 --> 00:55.098
the CEO's autobiography
and an audio version

00:55.142 --> 00:57.100
read by Emily Deschanel
from "Bones."

00:57.144 --> 00:58.319
- Wow.
- What?

00:58.362 --> 01:00.147
- Love her.
- I'm a total "Bones"-head.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.757
- How are we supposed to use
any of this stuff

01:01.800 --> 01:04.281
when we're not even allowed to
have our phones on the floor?

01:04.325 --> 01:07.893
- The new policy says that you
can have your phones now.

01:07.937 --> 01:11.332
In fact, you are expected
to carry them.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.205
- Holy .

01:15.249 --> 01:18.165
- I am so happy right now.

01:18.208 --> 01:21.342
- So to reiterate, we must
download an app that can

01:21.385 --> 01:23.344
track our phones,
and then we must carry

01:23.387 --> 01:25.215
our phones at all times.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.522
And everybody here is just,
like, fine with that?

01:27.565 --> 01:28.784
- Yes.
- Pretty much.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.133
- Yeah.
- What's the problem?

01:30.177 --> 01:32.614
- "Who Run the World? Me"

01:32.657 --> 01:35.312
by Kira Moon.
Read by Emily Deschanel.

01:35.356 --> 01:36.748
- I could listen to that lady

01:36.792 --> 01:38.359
read the phone book.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.317
- I had nothing but
a seed loan from my father...

01:46.889 --> 01:49.283
- I linked the app to my
Facebook and checking accounts.

01:49.326 --> 01:51.894
I got the Super Sharer badge.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.461
You hate this, don't you?

01:53.504 --> 01:56.333
- I just don't love handing
giant corporations a way

01:56.377 --> 01:58.901
to get my address, my contacts,
and all of my passwords.

01:58.944 --> 02:01.251
- I already gave all of that up
to figure out which cat

02:01.295 --> 02:02.731
from "Cats" I am.

02:02.774 --> 02:05.429
Macavity, the magical one.
- What do you think

02:05.473 --> 02:06.865
they're gonna do with
that information, anyway?

02:06.909 --> 02:08.040
- A lot.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.173
They can track
what you do, what you like.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.349
They can scan your internet
searches for keywords

02:12.393 --> 02:14.873
and then just send you ads for
things you were talking about.

02:14.917 --> 02:18.181
- That just seems thoughtful.
- Yeah, but then they can just

02:18.225 --> 02:21.271
package your data and sell it
to other companies.

02:21.315 --> 02:24.492
- And then those companies
would give you the free help?

02:24.535 --> 02:26.624
- I'm--I'm not doing it
justice.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.539
- So you think you're so
fascinating that Zephra's

02:28.583 --> 02:30.367
dying to learn which
Beach House album

02:30.411 --> 02:31.629
you just preordered?

02:31.673 --> 02:33.544
- Ah, the "I've got nothing
to hide" argument.

02:33.588 --> 02:35.807
Where have I heard that before?
- Bible camp.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.549
"In Christ I have nothing
to hide, nothing to prove,

02:38.593 --> 02:40.638
nothing to fear,
nothing to lose."

02:40.682 --> 02:43.772
- Hmm, is that where you
heard it, Jonah? Bible camp?

02:43.815 --> 02:44.903
- Maybe.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.993
- Hey, this cartoon thing
you sent me.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.691
Is it supposed to be you
or, like, a depressing,

02:49.734 --> 02:50.822
aged-up Dora?

02:50.866 --> 02:52.215
- No, it's me.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.782
You can design your own avatar
on the app.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.392
- And the purple streak
in your hair?

02:55.436 --> 02:57.089
- Well, yeah, that's just
for fun.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.613
To see what it would look like.
I mean, it's not like I could

02:58.656 --> 03:00.919
actually pull that off
in real life, right?

03:00.963 --> 03:02.660
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.532
- Yeah.
Look, I can make you one.

03:04.575 --> 03:06.316
- Oh, knock yourself out.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.753
I never got into the whole
texting fad.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.234
- Really? You've texted me.
- Yeah, to convey information,

03:11.278 --> 03:12.757
but, like, sending someone
a little picture or something?

03:12.801 --> 03:14.455
It's, like, what's the point?

03:14.498 --> 03:16.979
- Well, sometimes you just feel
like sending someone an emoji

03:17.022 --> 03:19.242
or, like, a GIF from a movie.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.984
- Why? Why would you do that
to someone?

03:22.027 --> 03:24.204
- Okay, never mind.
Here, look.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.903
- Huh. Oh, that does kinda
look like me.

03:27.946 --> 03:31.254
- Yeah, and you can change
the facial expressions.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.822
- Whoa, I can change my race.
- Yes, but you shouldn't.

03:33.865 --> 03:34.823
That's--
- See, I knew it.

03:34.866 --> 03:35.867
People are always telling me

03:35.911 --> 03:37.086
I'd be a beautiful
Indian woman.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.870
- You should really change
that back, Dina.

03:38.914 --> 03:41.003
Who--who--who says that?

03:41.046 --> 03:43.788
- ♪ Say to me,
whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪

03:45.486 --> 03:48.750
♪ I'll always be there
when you wake ♪

03:48.793 --> 03:50.621
- Every time you take a trip
back and forth

03:50.665 --> 03:52.362
to the stock room,
you earn points.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.059
I'm already at
"Stockroom Fiend."

03:54.103 --> 03:55.757
- Well,
I'm a "Stockroom Rockstar."

03:55.800 --> 03:57.933
If I ever get "Stockroom Fiend"
again, kill me.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.630
Seriously.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.589
- If you click on the little
clock on the bottom,

04:01.632 --> 04:04.287
it tells you how much time
you have left on your break.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.289
- Wait, what?
- Yup. Eight minutes.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.464
- Mine says six.

04:07.508 --> 04:08.900
- Wait, they're timing
our breaks now?

04:08.944 --> 04:10.946
- How do they even know that
we're in the break room?

04:10.989 --> 04:13.775
- Hold on.
- It's GPS probably.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.298
I bet it's GPS.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.908
- So we're only allowed
to be in the break room

04:16.952 --> 04:18.388
if we're actually on break now?

04:18.432 --> 04:19.868
- Okay, it stops counting
out here.

04:19.911 --> 04:22.349
- This isn't even a break.
This is just...

04:22.392 --> 04:23.915
unofficial break room time.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.656
- And now it's counting
down again.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.442
- GPS.
Global Positioning System.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.574
- You can't fit a whole
15-minute break

04:30.618 --> 04:31.967
into just 15 minutes.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.795
- I can't relax if
I know I'm being timed.

04:33.838 --> 04:34.926
It's too much pressure.

04:34.970 --> 04:38.060
- Stopped. Started. Stopped.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.889
- So what if we leave our
phones outside the break room?

04:40.932 --> 04:42.804
That way they won't know
when we're in here.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.720
- A break without your phone?
- Do you hear yourself?

04:45.763 --> 04:48.418
- Jesus, Justine,
either help or keep quiet.

04:48.462 --> 04:49.419
- Now it's stopped again.

04:49.463 --> 04:52.814
I'm 70% sure
this is what it is.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.731
- My man, I made something
for you.

04:56.774 --> 04:57.819
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, try it on.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.386
- What--what am I
looking at here?

04:59.429 --> 05:00.648
- It's a hat lined
with tin foil

05:00.691 --> 05:02.867
so Zephra can't hack
into your thoughts.

05:02.911 --> 05:05.479
- Okay, all right, I get it.
So I'm just some sort of, like,

05:05.522 --> 05:07.611
wacko conspiracy theorist
for thinking that

05:07.655 --> 05:10.788
a tech conglomerate
just might want to check out

05:10.832 --> 05:12.790
its employees' phone activity.
- Shh.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.663
The lizard people are all
around us; they'll hear you.

05:15.706 --> 05:18.100
Sorry, buddy. Not you.
You look totally normal.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.929
- Okay, so you're so sure
that nobody's looking

05:20.972 --> 05:22.496
you wouldn't mind if I took
your phone and just, like,

05:22.539 --> 05:24.672
Googled a bunch of weird
porn or something?

05:24.715 --> 05:25.934
Be my guest.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.849
If you think I haven't Googled
weird porn,

05:27.892 --> 05:29.546
you're in for a treat.
- Okay, all right, fine.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.461
Then what if I, uh,
what if I wrote

05:31.505 --> 05:33.071
"How to murder my coworkers"?

05:33.115 --> 05:35.030
- Doesn't bother me.
- You sure? 'Cause I--

05:35.073 --> 05:36.771
'Cause I'm doing it.
- Go for it.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.643
- Okay, I'm--here we go.
It's--I'm--I'm typing it.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.384
- Type it.
- Into your phone right now.

05:41.428 --> 05:42.820
- Great.
- Got it all queued up.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.039
- Okay.
- Ready to send.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.170
- Send it.
- I'm gonna send it.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.042
- Press it.
- Pressing it.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.565
- There you go.
- Boom.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.001
- And I'm still here.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.439
- Well, no one was saying
you would, like,

05:52.482 --> 05:54.702
immediately disappear.
- Yeah, no, I know that.

05:54.745 --> 05:57.008
I was just trying
to add some flair.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.488
- We got hit with
a ton of graffiti

05:58.532 --> 05:59.489
that we have to remove.

05:59.533 --> 06:00.751
I'm not sure if it was a bunch

06:00.795 --> 06:02.405
of different people...

06:02.449 --> 06:04.494
Or just one guy
with a lot of range.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.801
Sorry.
Text from Dina.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.542
"Heads up, spill in Produce,"

06:08.585 --> 06:10.413
with her avatar
surfing on a banana.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.851
- Ooh, 'cause Produce!
- Yup, I'm guessing so.

06:13.895 --> 06:17.028
At any rate, they spray painted
a pentagram in Toys & Games,

06:17.072 --> 06:18.682
which I've just been telling
the parents

06:18.726 --> 06:20.815
is a "Frozen" thing, so.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.947
Sorry.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.863
- Apple emoji, orange emoji,
grapes emoji...

06:25.907 --> 06:27.038
- She's good at this.
- Yeah.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.171
- Hey, Amy,
ignore the baseball.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.738
I thought it was
a shelled coconut.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.044
- All good.
Just, uh, trying to get through

06:33.088 --> 06:34.219
some assignments here.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.613
- Got it.
- Okay.

06:36.657 --> 06:40.008
Okay, um, where was I?
Uh...

06:40.051 --> 06:43.141
Oh, right--also, they
spray painted "Greta is God"

06:43.185 --> 06:44.882
in the changing rooms, now--

06:44.926 --> 06:48.886
Um, I'm not sure if they
meant Gerwig or Thunberg,

06:48.930 --> 06:50.888
but not that it matters.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.934
What I need is for you--
- Amy!

06:52.977 --> 06:54.979
Check your phone!
This is a good one!

06:56.546 --> 06:59.157
- It's a meme of Indiana Jones
cracking his whip.

06:59.201 --> 07:02.857
- It's you, the boss!
Apparently, it's from a movie!

07:02.900 --> 07:04.902
- Wow, generations
have changed, huh?

07:04.946 --> 07:07.992
If it were me, I'd find that
incredibly annoying.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.522
- It's obviously toothbrushes.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.263
- Or is it teethbrush?
Like attorneys general?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.527
Are you gonna answer
any of those?

07:20.570 --> 07:22.050
It's Dina.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.617
She won't stop texting.

07:23.660 --> 07:27.272
- It is crazy how people act
like the rules of human decency

07:27.316 --> 07:29.710
don't apply in the digital
space, especially be--

07:29.753 --> 07:31.407
you're not listening.
- Yeah, I'm sorry,

07:31.451 --> 07:34.018
I can only feign interest
in one conversation at a time.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.020
Everything's in caps.
And when she sends

07:36.064 --> 07:39.067
a long message, she sends
each word individually.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.416
- Maybe you should
just mute her.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.070
- You can mute people?
- Yeah, it's right here

07:42.113 --> 07:43.245
in the settings.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.377
- Ooh, that's a game changer.
- Boom.

07:45.421 --> 07:48.555
- I mean, I feel kinda bad,
but it's too much.

07:48.598 --> 07:49.991
- While we're at it, do you
maybe wanna change

07:50.034 --> 07:52.646
your passcode to something
besides "0000"?

07:52.689 --> 07:56.563
- Eh, if I did, I'd have to
change it on my debit card too.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.303
- I know that's a joke.
Right?

07:58.347 --> 07:59.479
- Not telling.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.179
- Hey, man.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.050
How's stuff been going
with you lately?

08:06.094 --> 08:08.226
Anything new?
- No, not really.

08:08.270 --> 08:12.100
- What are you writing?
A note to someone?

08:12.143 --> 08:15.233
- No, I'm just doodling.
- Oh, yeah, nice.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.061
Looks good, man.
You're talented.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.501
Well, hey, I should
get back to it.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.373
But I'm right over there if
there's any issues or anything.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.592
- What issues?

08:25.635 --> 08:27.115
- Well, I mean, not like
"issues," but, like,

08:27.158 --> 08:28.638
if you need to talk
or tell me something,

08:28.682 --> 08:31.293
or something happens
or whatever...

08:31.336 --> 08:33.556
I'm around.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.993
- Yeah, okay, thanks.
- No doubt.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.129
- Sandra, did you catch that?
- Yeah.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.653
Listened to the entire thing.
I'm always listening.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.568
- Well, did it sound
weird to you?

08:45.612 --> 08:48.310
He's never talked to me before.
- I don't know.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.747
A lot of people have never
talked to me before.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.537
- I didn't know people took
their breaks out here.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.626
- Mainly just smokers.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.715
Usually cigarettes,
but sometimes crack.

09:01.758 --> 09:04.761
- Oh, I would do anything
for some crack right now.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.328
Just for the warmth.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.591
- Well, the important thing
is we're not being timed.

09:08.635 --> 09:11.072
So, you know, we can just
sit back and relax.

09:14.162 --> 09:16.120
- I'm so fricking cold.
- I know.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.732
- I can't feel my hands.
- I'm also having a bad time.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.037
- It's not that bad.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.648
We're outside,
the sun is shining...

09:21.691 --> 09:23.040
- I mean, it's not shining,

09:23.084 --> 09:24.694
but whatever.
It's up there.

09:24.738 --> 09:27.262
- We should warm up
by combining body heat.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.177
Do you guys wanna press up

09:29.220 --> 09:30.526
against each other?

09:30.570 --> 09:33.398
- I'm going inside.
- Me too.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.318
- Hey, did you get the link
I texted you?

09:40.362 --> 09:42.451
- Uh, the link?

09:42.494 --> 09:45.149
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was funny.

09:45.193 --> 09:47.325
- Oh, what was it? It--
some rando emailed it to me.

09:47.369 --> 09:48.805
I was nervous it was a virus
or something.

09:48.849 --> 09:52.461
- Um, I'm trying to remember.

09:52.504 --> 09:55.507
You know, my brain is foggy.
Amy need coffee.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.205
Want caffeine.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.120
- I'm not sure what that was,

09:59.163 --> 10:00.643
but it is not banter-ready.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.733
- W-What are you doing?
- 0000.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.866
- How do you know my password?
- I'm looking for that link.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.345
Are you not getting
all my texts?

10:07.389 --> 10:09.217
- Uh, maybe not.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.219
You know, the service
around here is spotty.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.656
- Why does it say "mute"
next to my name?

10:13.700 --> 10:15.266
- Huh?

10:15.310 --> 10:16.790
- Says "mute" next to my name.

10:16.833 --> 10:21.142
- Oh, um, yeah.
Uh, so you were--

10:21.185 --> 10:22.665
you were texting me a lot,

10:22.709 --> 10:25.450
um, and my phone just kept
dinging and I couldn't really

10:25.494 --> 10:29.106
get my work done, so I just
temporarily muted you.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.763
- You--you muted me?
- Temporarily.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.243
- Wow.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.114
Didn't realize
I was so annoying.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.768
Maybe I should just sell my
voice to a sea witch,

10:38.812 --> 10:40.422
become nothing but
a pretty, pretty face.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.380
- N-no, Dina, come on.
It's not like that.

10:42.424 --> 10:43.773
- Wait, so you didn't get my
security memo

10:43.817 --> 10:44.774
about the Chafies?

10:44.818 --> 10:46.341
- Chafies?
- Yes.

10:46.384 --> 10:47.603
The fuel cans that
caterers use?

10:47.647 --> 10:48.735
Teens are drinking them
to get high.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.475
We have to put out red
label warnings.

10:50.519 --> 10:51.868
- Red label warnings?

10:51.912 --> 10:53.435
Dina, you can't just text me
something like that.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.915
We could get in
a lot of trouble.

10:54.958 --> 10:57.831
- Yeah, I know, that's why I
added my avatar like this.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.746
I thought it was screaming,
but I guess I was silent,

10:59.789 --> 11:02.357
because you muted me.
You took away my voice.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.229
- Okay, well--
that's dramatic.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.710
- So by that logic, it wouldn't
be a box of toothpicks,

11:07.754 --> 11:09.669
it would be a box
of teeth-pick?

11:09.712 --> 11:12.236
- No, no, because well--

11:12.280 --> 11:13.760
Yeah, maybe.

11:13.803 --> 11:16.676
- Yo, somebody broke
into my locker.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.721
- What?
- Did they take anything?

11:18.765 --> 11:21.332
- No, doesn't look like it.
Just looks like they

11:21.376 --> 11:23.552
went through everything.
- Huh.

11:23.595 --> 11:24.814
- You don't think this is
because of the Google search,

11:24.858 --> 11:25.815
do you?

11:25.859 --> 11:27.469
- N-no.
I mean, I--

11:27.512 --> 11:29.732
I don't think.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.386
- Sal used to break
into people's lockers.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.562
But usually just to lick
their stuff.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.825
- Yeah, that's probably it.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.873
- Wanna know a secret?
- Always.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.962
- I'm the one that broke
into his locker.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.267
- Oh.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.834
You're a locker-licker too?

11:44.878 --> 11:48.403
- No, no, it was revenge for
acting like I'm the crazy one.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.535
- Oh.
- Yeah, I even got Ken

11:50.579 --> 11:51.928
to act weird around him too.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.756
- Oh, this is genius.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.758
- Can I help? I'm never
on the happy end of a prank.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.456
- It's not a prank.
More like gaslighting.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.502
But, uh, yeah, sure, whatever.

12:00.545 --> 12:03.331
- Yes! Revenge of the losers!

12:03.374 --> 12:05.812
- Oh, we don't have
to call it that.

12:05.855 --> 12:08.858
- You got it, buddy.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.208
- Apparently, teens are
drinking the slushie stuff

12:11.252 --> 12:12.819
inside of these
for the alcohol.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.647
So starting now, if anybody
buys one of these

12:15.691 --> 12:17.998
without a warning and they die,
we're liable.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.651
- Actually, starting
an hour ago.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.958
We're a little delayed because
Amy was busy mean-girling me.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.699
- I really think you're
blowing this out of proportion.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.005
- I think I'm blowing
it into proportion.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.920
- What if someone already
bought those,

12:26.963 --> 12:29.009
but without a warning?

12:29.052 --> 12:31.838
'Cause I just sold six
24-packs to a teenager.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.797
- A teenager bought 144 cans
of chafing fuel,

12:34.841 --> 12:36.451
and you didn't think
that was suspicious?

12:36.494 --> 12:38.453
- I thought it was incredibly
suspicious!

12:38.496 --> 12:39.889
That's why I remembered.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.369
But look, he was
on a skateboard.

12:41.412 --> 12:42.674
You can probably
still catch him.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.851
- Well, we can try.
Come on, Dina.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.809
- Wow, first you mute me,
then you kill a child.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.506
Busy day for you.
- Nobody's dying.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.508
- She said as the child dies.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.688
- Do you see anybody?
Ooh, what about that guy?

12:56.732 --> 12:58.603
Oh, no, that's just
a bag of leaves.

12:58.647 --> 13:01.171
Kinda looked like
a person though, huh?

13:02.172 --> 13:03.260
Hello?

13:05.567 --> 13:07.525
Oh, right.

13:07.569 --> 13:10.180
'Cause I muted you.
Got it.

13:11.921 --> 13:15.664
You made your point.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.234
- And so then I said to her,

13:20.277 --> 13:21.888
"You're the one who
just got a raise.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.977
Why don't you buy
the dryer balls?"

13:24.020 --> 13:26.022
- Yeah, man, uh, I'm cool
to show you in silence.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.632
- Thanks, but I need to get
this out.

13:27.676 --> 13:30.984
And let me tell you, that is
not what she wanted to hear.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.289
So she starts in with,

13:32.333 --> 13:33.813
"You're just threatened
by a woman--"

13:33.856 --> 13:35.249
- Hold on a sec.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.994
What the hell?
- Oh, cool.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.561
Is this racism?
- No.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.346
And don't be so
excited about it.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.043
- Sorry.

13:47.087 --> 13:51.613
- We're going back, yeah, yeah.
And front, stop, turn around--

13:51.656 --> 13:53.354
oh, yeah, I can go
that way too, buddy.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.747
- Jonah, you are the new
prank king.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.663
- Again, it--it's not a prank.
I'm--I'm teaching Garrett

13:58.707 --> 13:59.795
a lesson.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.710
- We're gonna be legends
after this.

14:01.753 --> 14:05.975
"Jonah and the Kid"
I bet they'll call us.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.150
- Uh-huh.

14:11.633 --> 14:15.202
Oh.
Everyone's in the men's room.

14:15.245 --> 14:18.988
Even some ladies.
- The app can't track us here.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.685
- Okay, I'm just gonna--

14:20.729 --> 14:22.949
- You know, I actually prefer
this to the break room.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.385
- Excuse me.
- It's cozier,

14:24.428 --> 14:26.300
the lighting's better,
there's a nice little echo.

14:26.343 --> 14:27.867
Whoa, whoops.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.870
- Yeah, I just wish it didn't
smell so much like farts.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.741
- The break room
smelled like farts.

14:32.784 --> 14:35.222
- Yeah, but you didn't know
if that was from actual farts.

14:35.265 --> 14:37.050
You could just tell yourself
it was someone's gumbo

14:37.093 --> 14:38.181
or something.

14:38.225 --> 14:41.010
- How's the peeing going?
- Fine.

14:41.054 --> 14:43.186
- Really?
I can't hear anything.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.321
- Guys, I don't think
this is working, either.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.888
- Nope.

14:48.931 --> 14:52.326
- Do you guys look?
'Cause I would totally look.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.242
Maybe we should do another
lap around the park?

14:55.285 --> 14:57.113
'Cause teens still drink
in the park, huh?

14:57.157 --> 15:00.943
It's what they do, still?

15:03.815 --> 15:05.948
- Oh, so you do
read your texts.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.950
- I'm sorry, it's Jonah.
I thought it was important.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.952
- And what did that
androgynous sex robot say

15:09.996 --> 15:11.301
that was so important
you needed to read it

15:11.345 --> 15:13.086
while driving?

15:13.129 --> 15:15.958
- "Getting Garrett good."
With a GIF of Nancy Pelosi

15:16.002 --> 15:17.177
clapping from
the Speaker's chair.

15:17.220 --> 15:18.787
- Mmm.
Totally worth dying for that.

15:18.830 --> 15:22.399
- Dina, I am sorry, but you
were texting me so much

15:22.443 --> 15:24.010
that I couldn't even
do my work!

15:24.053 --> 15:25.098
- You could've just said,

15:25.141 --> 15:26.403
"Dina, you're texting
too much!"

15:26.447 --> 15:27.970
- Well, I didn't want to hurt
your feelings.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.016
And the moment anyone tries
to criticize you,

15:30.059 --> 15:31.669
you just explode.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.149
- Well, at least people know
where they stand with me, okay?

15:33.193 --> 15:34.368
I don't pretend to be
somebody's friend

15:34.411 --> 15:35.673
and then secretly
shut them out.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.111
It's called honesty.
- Oh, is it honest, Dina,

15:38.154 --> 15:39.982
or is it just you treating
people like garbage

15:40.026 --> 15:41.201
and calling it a virtue?

15:41.244 --> 15:42.680
- Oh, you're so pathetic.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.334
You're so worried about
having everyone's approval.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.206
I don't care if people like me.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.208
- Well, good,
because nobody does.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.959
- I'm sorry.

16:00.002 --> 16:03.005
I didn't mean that.
I--

16:03.049 --> 16:04.224
Can we--
- Watch out, watch out!

16:04.267 --> 16:06.226
- Oh, my God!

16:06.269 --> 16:08.793
What did I just hit?
- We hit a goose.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.013
- Oh, thank God.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.015
- We hit a goose.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.453
- ♪ What is wrong

16:16.497 --> 16:18.412
♪ What is wrong

16:18.455 --> 16:20.327
♪ Give me a sign

16:20.370 --> 16:21.328
♪ What is love?

16:26.072 --> 16:27.334
- Hey, man.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.031
- Wow, wound a little tightly
there, buddy.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.859
Everything all right?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.861
No, you know what?
Uh, everything's not all right.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.297
I think they're spying
on our phones.

16:34.341 --> 16:37.039
- What? I thought you said
I was the paranoid one.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.475
- I thought you were,
but then they started

16:38.519 --> 16:40.869
following me around; they
started searching my stuff.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.088
That woman in the café

16:42.131 --> 16:43.872
who's pretending to read
the newspaper?

16:43.915 --> 16:44.916
Nobody reads newspapers
anymore.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.092
- I do.
- No, you don't.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.963
You say you do, but you don't.
- Guys.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.530
Something crazy is happening.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.793
There are men in black suits
swarming the parking lot,

16:51.836 --> 16:53.795
saying things like,
"Quantico, this is Daniels"

16:53.838 --> 16:55.884
and "Uncle Phil is on the move,
I repeat,

16:55.927 --> 16:57.320
Uncle Phil is on the move."

16:57.364 --> 17:00.062
- Wow, that is too crazy.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.760
- The only question is,
who is Uncle Phil?

17:02.804 --> 17:04.371
Probably someone that looks
like Uncle Phil.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.895
- It's me!
I look like Uncle Phil!

17:06.938 --> 17:09.028
Man, why'd you do that
stupid Google search?!

17:09.071 --> 17:11.117
- Whoa, calm down.
- No, I'm not gonna calm down.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.032
You calm down.
You're always starting stuff!

17:13.075 --> 17:15.208
"Hey, Garrett, let's Google
how to murder somebody."

17:15.251 --> 17:16.861
Well, you happy now?
What's next?

17:16.905 --> 17:19.125
"Hey, Garrett, let's tell
Zephra to email the police

17:19.168 --> 17:21.083
and tell them I just planted
a bomb in the store!"

17:21.127 --> 17:22.867
- Emailing local police.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.521
"I just planted a bomb
in the store."

17:24.565 --> 17:26.871
- Oh.
- Would you like to send?

17:26.915 --> 17:27.916
- N--
- Yes.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.135
- What?
- No!

17:29.178 --> 17:31.963
- Okay, I've sent your email.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.487
- Why?

17:33.530 --> 17:35.793
- I just always say yes.

17:42.452 --> 17:43.975
- It's mating season.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.542
Her gander must be
worried sick.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.327
- How do you know it's a she?

17:47.370 --> 17:49.459
- The undercarriage.
The neck.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.895
The feather loss
on the back of her head

17:50.939 --> 17:52.593
where her mate pinned her down
during penetration.

17:52.636 --> 17:53.768
- Okay.

17:56.553 --> 17:59.861
Dina, I am sorry that I said
nobody likes you.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.428
That's just not true.

18:01.471 --> 18:02.994
I--
- It's okay.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.606
I overreacted to the whole
muting thing.

18:05.649 --> 18:08.087
I just had a really hard year.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.653
My birds flew away.

18:09.697 --> 18:12.439
my dad turned out
to be a big nothing.

18:12.482 --> 18:15.050
I can't even remember the
last time I had a boyfriend.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.532
Even Sandra got married.
Who saw that coming?

18:18.575 --> 18:21.578
- Yeah, but she married
Jerry, so...

18:21.622 --> 18:23.537
- Yeah, I recognize that.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.280
How does it work with geese?

18:27.323 --> 18:29.934
Do you think I can just
have this?

18:29.978 --> 18:32.067
- Um, I--
I don't know.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.721
I--I would ask.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.505
- Do you understand how badly
this could have gone?

18:35.549 --> 18:36.724
People could have been shot.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.726
- Again, we are so, so sorry.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.119
- Yeah, I guess this is
what happens

18:40.162 --> 18:41.424
when someone who doesn't know
how to do a prank

18:41.468 --> 18:42.556
tries to do a prank.

18:42.599 --> 18:43.992
- Not a prank.
It was comeuppance.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.342
It was an attempted
comeuppance.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.822
- People go to jail
for this kind of thing.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.519
- Jonah was the ringleader.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.782
- Seriously?
- I was intimidated.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.219
I'm a very weak person.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.089
- I'm gonna let you off
with a warning this time.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.786
But in the future,

18:55.830 --> 18:57.353
you should never joke
about bombs.

18:57.397 --> 18:58.615
- Right, sorry.
Yeah, no, I--

18:58.659 --> 18:59.877
I thought that was just
airplanes.

18:59.921 --> 19:02.837
- It's everywhere.
- It's everywhere, Jonah.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.889
- ♪ Sweet love

19:11.933 --> 19:13.978
- So then, okay,
we got to the restaurant--

19:14.022 --> 19:15.415
- Three minutes left.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.807
- Sweetie, I need to know
if this is going somewhere.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.635
- It is! Okay,
so then we get into our booth

19:18.679 --> 19:19.984
and you won't believe
who we saw.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.638
- We will believe it.
Just hurry up and say it.

19:21.682 --> 19:22.857
- Okay, just give me a second!

19:22.900 --> 19:23.858
- We don't have a second.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.033
- Two minutes, 30 seconds!

19:25.076 --> 19:26.165
- Just jump to the end!

19:26.208 --> 19:27.644
- Fine!
We get back to the party,

19:27.688 --> 19:28.819
Tish had my necklace,

19:28.863 --> 19:30.647
and K-Fai is making out
with Greg!

19:30.691 --> 19:31.822
- Who the hell is Greg?!

19:31.866 --> 19:32.823
- You would know if you didn't
make me

19:32.867 --> 19:33.998
skip to the end of the story!

19:34.042 --> 19:35.652
- Oh, my God.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.654
- Her heartbeat is stable,
so that's good.

19:37.698 --> 19:38.829
- She drank some water
in the car,

19:38.873 --> 19:40.657
which gives me hope
for her stomach.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.093
- She might have a broken leg,
so...

19:42.137 --> 19:44.008
I'd like to get an X-ray
while she's still sedated.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.359
An X-ray for a goose?

19:46.402 --> 19:47.795
How much is that gonna cost?

19:47.838 --> 19:48.970
- It'll probably be about $250.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.624
- $250?!

19:50.667 --> 19:54.410
That's like ten giant
buckets of KFC.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.759
Sorry, that sounded
really callous.

19:55.803 --> 19:56.978
I don't hate animals.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.980
- Yeah, well, most people
who hit geese

19:59.023 --> 20:00.111
don't even get out
of their cars,

20:00.155 --> 20:01.461
much less bring them to me,

20:01.504 --> 20:03.985
so it's actually nice to see.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.769
- Well,
I used to have 16 birds,

20:05.813 --> 20:07.684
so I guess you could call me
a softie.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.512
- 16?

20:09.556 --> 20:10.861
Wow, you do not look like
someone

20:10.905 --> 20:12.036
who would have that many birds.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.603
- The
is that supposed to mean?

20:13.647 --> 20:14.996
-  Nothing.

20:15.039 --> 20:18.042
Sorry, I meant to say that
I also have

20:18.086 --> 20:19.174
a lot of birds,

20:19.218 --> 20:21.002
and when women

20:21.045 --> 20:22.873
come in here with a lot
of birds,

20:22.917 --> 20:25.746
they're usually older
or not as attractive.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.182
I am so sorry

20:27.226 --> 20:28.444
that I said that.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.141
I'm gonna write up
the X-ray thing--

20:30.185 --> 20:33.493
try to do it very soon...

20:33.536 --> 20:35.625
- Uh, and your wife?

20:35.669 --> 20:38.106
Or girlfriend, what does she
think about all your birds?

20:38.149 --> 20:39.716
- Oh, I'm single.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.457
- What about the dudes you meet
on message boards

20:41.501 --> 20:42.937
and then bring home to bone?

20:42.980 --> 20:44.634
Do they like the birds?

20:44.678 --> 20:45.853
- I'm not gay.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.769
But I assume gay people
also like birds.

20:48.812 --> 20:52.729
Okay, so, radiograph
of a goose

20:52.773 --> 20:54.775
hit by car...

20:54.818 --> 20:56.080
not driver's fault.

20:56.124 --> 20:59.562
- Um,
I'm gonna go make a call

20:59.606 --> 21:01.695
to my insurance company
and see if they

21:01.738 --> 21:03.174
cover bird X-rays.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.872
- Oh, they don't.

21:04.915 --> 21:08.049
- Well, I'm gonna go do
something else then.

21:08.092 --> 21:10.269
- She's probably actually gonna
just take a giant dump.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.272
Anyway, uh,

21:13.315 --> 21:15.274
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to...

21:15.317 --> 21:17.450
walk me through
the spaying process?

21:17.493 --> 21:19.756
It's just something
I've always been interested in.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.455
- Yeah, for sure.
