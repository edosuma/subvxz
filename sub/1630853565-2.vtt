00:07.799 --> 00:09.759
Think that video
has a lot of views, Wendy?

00:09.843 --> 00:11.302
<i>I think this is my fault…</i>

00:11.386 --> 00:14.139
That depends on your
social media consumption.

00:14.222 --> 00:15.557
You know, influencing and whatnot.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.601
Would you plot eight million views
as a lot?

00:18.685 --> 00:22.022
Yes, I do. I mean, I only have Facebook
to message with my dad.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.898
So it's very high indeed for me.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.027
Tom, could you please stop staring at me?

00:27.110 --> 00:28.945
Oh, I'm sorry. But I'm preoccupied.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.824
This guy glows, our coworker.
He… he freaking glows. What the fuck?

00:32.907 --> 00:34.617
Yeah, well, that's an astute point.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.744
Um…

00:36.327 --> 00:39.998
But I'm pretty sure there's a reasonable
medical explanation for this?

00:40.081 --> 00:42.917
I mean, I also think
it's just really cool. We don't know--

00:43.001 --> 00:44.586
-Okay, I gotta know this--
-Tom!

00:44.669 --> 00:46.880
Stop interrupting me or I will end you.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.466
Amily, I'm not interrupting.
I'm collaboratively overlapping.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.676
-You're so full of shit.
-Maybe it's lead poisoning.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.304
Have you swallowed
any watch batteries lately?

00:55.138 --> 00:58.725
You know what? I gotta know. Can you do
anything else besides just glow?

00:58.808 --> 01:01.561
-Of course not.
-You can make that Harry Styles song play.

01:01.644 --> 01:04.647
Oh, but I think that was a coincidence,
because that song is popular.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.817
-Mm, 2017.
-Also, Harry Styles has a third nipple.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.694
I don't know if that's relevant.

01:09.778 --> 01:10.904
I don't-- I don't know.

01:10.987 --> 01:14.324
Gee whiz, Clark. You are getting
tons more views. You're blowing up.

01:14.407 --> 01:18.036
Okay, while we're on the topic, can you
make other Harry Styles songs play?

01:29.005 --> 01:31.049
-So, how you feelin', son? You okay?

01:31.132 --> 01:32.884
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:32.967 --> 01:33.927
Why do you ask?

01:34.010 --> 01:36.805
Uh, because you passed out
in your backyard the other night.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.807
Oh, right. Of course.

01:39.891 --> 01:44.562
You have to tell me something because
I'm very troubled, my precious son.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.106
Tell you what?

01:46.189 --> 01:48.149
I saw all that hubbub on Twitter.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.735
Oh, you saw that.
You saw the glowing thing?

01:50.819 --> 01:53.321
Yeah, I saw that.
A lot of people saw that.

01:53.404 --> 01:54.906
-Oh man.
-You have to tell me.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.574
How'd you do the trick?

01:56.658 --> 01:58.660
Um-- Well, Pop, it wasn't a trick.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.703
I don't know what it was
or what's happening.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.164
-But it wasn't a trick.
-Clark, please don't do that to me.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.499
Please.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.543
I mean, it's bullshit, son.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.962
You know, if you're not honest
with me, then…

02:09.462 --> 02:10.672
you know, it hurts my feelings.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.382
Pop, I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.676
But the point is, I'm just

02:15.301 --> 02:17.303
too old to be

02:18.096 --> 02:18.930
bullshat.

02:19.013 --> 02:19.848
Okay.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.810
Not sure you can change
the tense of the word like that,

02:23.893 --> 02:25.687
-but I understand what you're saying.
-Okay!

02:25.770 --> 02:27.897
-I'm not trying to quibble on grammar.
-Okay.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.400
It really… It kills me to say this.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.610
But when, and only when

02:33.528 --> 02:35.321
you can be honest with me,

02:35.405 --> 02:37.323
then, and only then

02:37.407 --> 02:39.242
will I give you the honor

02:39.325 --> 02:42.745
of a pleasurable sauna with me.

02:42.829 --> 02:43.705
Pop!

02:44.247 --> 02:47.250
I don't think you should phrase it
that way. I'm telling the truth!

02:47.333 --> 02:49.878
And hey, you left your pants in here.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.172
Keep 'em, son. Keep my pants!

02:52.255 --> 02:55.550
Keep everything
until we have no more secrets between us.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.052
Dang it.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.934
So has anybody learned anything
from Operation Why Does Clark Glow?

03:05.018 --> 03:06.686
Well, over here on Team Wendy,

03:06.769 --> 03:08.938
I have come back
with virtual tiddly-squat.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.274
Basically, I jumped down two wormholes.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.694
They were alien conspiracy theories
and ghost stories.

03:14.777 --> 03:18.239
-Oof.
-I'm sorry to say I haven't found much.

03:18.823 --> 03:22.035
Even people who, um,
supposedly spontaneously combust--

03:22.118 --> 03:24.871
Oh, my gosh, what?
Combust? I-- I'm gonna be blown up?

03:24.954 --> 03:27.707
No, no, no. You don't just simply blow up.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.877
The combustion is from
self-heating too quickly,

03:30.960 --> 03:33.630
which can then lead to auto-igniting,

03:33.713 --> 03:39.260
but you don't glow first, so unfortunately
we can scratch that one off the list.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.262
Okay, crossing off combustion.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.933
Plus, that's gotta be incredibly rare
if it's even a real thing at all.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.185
It's definitely a real thing.
It's very real.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.812
Three out of my four uncles combusted.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.942
I don't--
It's not gonna happen to you, though.

03:54.025 --> 03:57.070
For sure, because I had a, uh…
What's the pre-- If you think of--

03:57.153 --> 03:58.529
-Premonition.
-About them.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.323
All three of them, but not about you!

04:01.115 --> 04:04.202
So, Mohsin, stop freakin' out Clark.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.288
Tom, what are you reading?

04:07.372 --> 04:09.832
Yeah, Tom, I noticed
nobody in there is burning,

04:09.916 --> 04:11.167
so that's a good start.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.628
Um, did-- did you find some good stuff?

04:13.711 --> 04:17.215
Well, I thought maybe there could be
a religious angle to this whole thing,

04:17.298 --> 04:22.971
but I am finding
that I am unable to decipher its code.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.139
Did you really think
you were just gonna pick that up

04:25.223 --> 04:27.016
and be able to read an ancient language?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.519
Well, you know.
I learned pig latin pretty quickly.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.230
Pig latin's not the same
as learning a real language, Tom.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.482
-Agree to disagree.
-Here's what we do know.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.734
Om-Tay is an ipshit-day.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.947
-What was that?
-I knew you wouldn't even know pig latin.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.782
No, well, I know pig latin… I know--

04:42.865 --> 04:45.368
Okay, that was pig…
Your accent was terrible.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.577
God, you're an idiot.

04:46.661 --> 04:50.748
Okay, bringing it back
to Operation Why Does Clark Glow?

04:50.832 --> 04:53.584
I did a little bit
of cross-referencing to glowing

04:53.668 --> 04:56.170
and the New Testament,
and I came up with a quote.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.173
"A city on a hill cannot be hidden."

04:59.257 --> 05:02.051
"Neither do people light a lamp
and put it under a bowl."

05:02.135 --> 05:04.012
"Instead, they put it on its stand,

05:04.095 --> 05:06.889
and it gives light
to everyone in the house."

05:06.973 --> 05:10.393
"In the same way,
let your light shine before men

05:10.476 --> 05:14.188
that they may see your good deeds
and praise your Father in Heaven."

05:14.689 --> 05:16.399
Matthew five: 14 through 16.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.070
How-- how did you know that, Clark?

05:26.826 --> 05:29.245
Wait a minute. Same song.
Why the same song?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.331
I don't know, Tom.
I'm not-- I'm not doing it.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.291
You didn't not do it, though.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.003
I think I just need a little bit of air.

05:37.086 --> 05:37.962
Okay.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.297
Um…

05:39.380 --> 05:41.841
Keep it up, guys. You're doing great.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.803
That's for you, Tom.
Try not to uck-say so ad-bay.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.598
-Okay.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.727
Four fingers on that hand.
That's not even <i>atomically </i>correct, so…

05:52.810 --> 05:55.063
Hmm. It's not even <i>anatomically </i>correct,
either.

05:55.146 --> 05:58.524
-What did I say?

06:02.111 --> 06:04.113
Did that guy just take my picture?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.323
No.No.

06:05.907 --> 06:06.949
Asshole.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.535
I know this is all,
you know, pretty weird…

06:09.619 --> 06:13.456
Well, it's very weird, actually,
but, I mean, at least you…

06:14.582 --> 06:15.958
play music that you really love.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.587
I mean, imagine if it was all this
plus music you… hated.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.550
Oh…

06:25.385 --> 06:26.636
Well, that's a shame.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.682
I think I'm supposed to help that bird.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.018
Oh.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.979
Like you're getting a… Is there a--

06:37.063 --> 06:39.440
Is there a voice,
like, telling you that in your head?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.692
No. I mean, unless my own voice is going…

06:41.776 --> 06:43.903
-What your mind does, yeah…
-Doesn't count. I was…

06:43.986 --> 06:47.448
I was referring to, like, if you're
hearing a voice that is not your own…

06:47.532 --> 06:49.242
-No.
-…in your head, you could be insane.

06:49.325 --> 06:53.121
-But it doesn't seem like you are.
-Yeah. No, it's…

06:53.996 --> 06:56.416
It's definitely too late for him.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.544
Oh, it's not a him. It's a her.
That's a girl bird.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.130
-Girl bird.
-I don't know how I--

07:02.213 --> 07:05.133
-Give me a second. I'm gonna go down here.
-Sure.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.511
And I'm gonna see if I can help her out.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.139
Hi, friend. How are we, friend?

07:11.222 --> 07:12.223
-Oh!

07:12.306 --> 07:13.933
-Oh no!
-Oh, oh! Oh!

07:16.769 --> 07:17.687
She charged me.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.772
-Oh, she charged you.
-She charged me.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.109
-So she's okay.
-She's… Yeah. Holy shit!

07:23.192 --> 07:25.319
You're like Moses, man.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.404
-I mean, I think.

07:26.487 --> 07:29.031
I don't really know
who specifically Moses is.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.535
I know he's one of the white dudes
with a-- with a beard and stuff,

07:32.618 --> 07:35.997
but did Moses,
kind of, resurrect dead birds?

07:36.080 --> 07:39.375
I don't have any idea.
I was raised Episcopalian.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.965
Holy shit.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.724
-Oh!

07:57.685 --> 08:00.730
-Oh, my God.
-No, no, no, no. Not God.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.232
Just one of his humble servants.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.485
Are you an angel?

08:06.068 --> 08:07.487
-Yes.
-Oh!

08:07.570 --> 08:09.447
-Yeah.
-That's awesome.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.490
That is awesome.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.616
Clark.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.035
-Oh! Hello.
-Ah, there he is.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.162
-Hello.
-Sorry about that.

08:16.245 --> 08:19.290
I am an angel sent by God.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.417
Oh no.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.756
It's great that-- you're an angel
and that you're here.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.217
-This is mind-blowing, actually.
-Yeah.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.511
-I didn't-- didn't get your name.
-Chamuel.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.262
-Samuel.
-Chamuel.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.223
-Chamuel.
-Chamuel.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.474
Chamuel.

08:36.557 --> 08:40.728
Okay, well, Chamuel, um,
what in particular brings you by?

08:40.811 --> 08:43.314
Okay, you, Clark,

08:44.023 --> 08:46.817
have been chosen by God

08:46.901 --> 08:49.612
-to help the world.
-Oh no.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.948
Really? I was afraid
he was gonna say something like this.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.408
-That's all right--
-I was really nervous about exactly this.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.244
So, here's the CliffsNotes version.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.456
Lucifer is currently attempting
to, once again,

09:00.540 --> 09:02.083
take over the throne of Heaven,

09:02.166 --> 09:05.920
and it's not going great
for the good guys at present.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.547
-Oh no.
-Yeah.

09:07.630 --> 09:12.343
Um, quick question. What does being
chosen by God to help the world mean?

09:12.426 --> 09:14.428
I don't even know
which religion is the right one.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.098
-We know.
-The Pennsylvania Dutch would be my guess.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.269
-Mm.
-I have to ask. Why me?

09:21.852 --> 09:23.688
I mean, I'm not that guy.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.899
I was never picked in gym class,
even when the teams weren't even.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.610
-See, I can, like, visualize that.
-Yeah.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.780
I'm not authorized to tell you
why God picked you.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.700
I'll do, obviously,
whatever I'm supposed to do.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.911
But I don't know what I'm supposed to do,
so what am I supposed to do?

09:38.995 --> 09:41.539
Spread the message. Be yourself.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.208
You know, you guys
will hear more about this later.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.295
It's all, kind of,
part of the process, you know?

09:47.378 --> 09:49.338
-Sorry, guys. I gotta go.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.464
See ya later.

09:50.548 --> 09:54.677
Don't worry if things get weird.
Always the darkest before the dawn.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.179
Unless Lucifer wins.

09:58.014 --> 09:58.889
Yeah, then…

09:59.599 --> 10:00.474
it would be dark.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.102
People would burn.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.146
Yeah.

10:07.189 --> 10:10.276
Oh, don't tell anyone about me. Not yet.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.911
I can't believe it. I mean…

10:21.495 --> 10:24.540
-Uh… Wow.
-Holy shit, right?

10:24.624 --> 10:25.458
Yeah.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.260
-Hi, there.
-Oh, my gosh.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.721
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm Judy. I'm with USA Today.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.932
Um, I'm a reporter.
A junior reporter but still a reporter.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.393
Um, I just wanted
to ask you a few questions?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.021
-Really?
-You have a problem with the free press?

10:47.104 --> 10:50.024
No, no, no, no. I love the free press.
It's, like, the best press.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.485
You write things
that people need to read about.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.279
Well, if a kid falls in a well,
that's you guys.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.782
And good job on that amendment.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.493
-The one… The good one.
-The-- the first one?

11:01.035 --> 11:03.204
-What's that?
-The-- the first amendment?

11:03.287 --> 11:06.123
Yeah. I love that one.
I put it right up there with the, uh…

11:06.207 --> 11:07.667
"Thou shall not kill," which is cool.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.920
Well, that's not so much an amendment.
That's a commandment.

11:11.003 --> 11:14.006
Right. Anyway, Judy,
it's been a blast meeting you,

11:14.090 --> 11:16.133
but it's been a weird day,
and I feel a little blarfy,

11:16.217 --> 11:17.968
just on the tinge of blarfness,

11:18.052 --> 11:20.680
so I'm wondering if we could talk
at a time that's maybe not now?

11:20.763 --> 11:23.057
It can be quick.
I wanted to ask you a few questions

11:23.140 --> 11:25.685
about the situation you experienced
at the restaurant.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.187
-I have to go. Really nice meeting you.
-Oh, well…

11:28.270 --> 11:30.648
We could--
we could set up a time that works for you!

11:30.731 --> 11:33.067
Will-- will you--
will you at least take my card?

11:33.150 --> 11:35.528
It has been such a pleasure meeting you.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.206
Wake up.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.711
Hey, guys?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.462
Hey, Frisbee.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.297
Hey, I have noticed

11:55.881 --> 11:59.760
that you guys
have not been doing your actual job,

11:59.844 --> 12:03.597
helping people with
their computer problems and IT issues,

12:03.681 --> 12:05.558
-for a couple of days now.
-Uh…

12:05.641 --> 12:07.727
It's a lot more
than a couple days, Frisbee,

12:07.810 --> 12:10.479
but something really important
is going on with Clark, so…

12:10.563 --> 12:12.440
Yeah, the guy glows, Frisbee.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.692
Yeah. Yeah, I know that Clark glows.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.902
-You do?
-Yeah, it doesn't bother me.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.321
More importantly,
it doesn't bother corporate. Okay?

12:19.405 --> 12:22.158
As long as we all stay
HR compliant, it's fine.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.118
-Of course, if you have a grievance,

12:24.201 --> 12:26.954
please, please file the L2 waiver, right?

12:27.037 --> 12:29.832
Then you and I can sit down,
and we can have a very meaningful,

12:29.915 --> 12:32.793
blue-sky, guided dialogue.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.545
I'm sorry. Did you say somethin'?

12:35.796 --> 12:38.758
No. Let's, uh…
let's dare to be great today, guys.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.093
Hey, Clark.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.597
-HR approves of your glowing.
-Oh.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.766
-Okay, thank you, Frisbee.
-Okay.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.726
Hey, where have you been?

12:48.809 --> 12:50.352
-Oh, I was, um… back in the…
-No, no, no.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.146
You don't have to answer.
What are you doin'?

12:52.229 --> 12:55.149
We know where he's been. You don't
need to kick him while he's down.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.610
What are you talking about?
I was just asking him a question.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.988
Oh my goodness. Clark, if I may, we all
know you've been having tummy trouble,

13:01.071 --> 13:04.408
what with the social media hubbub
surrounding the glowing,

13:04.492 --> 13:06.160
-all that stuff, it's stressful.
-Yeah!

13:06.243 --> 13:08.788
Yeah, I mean, you know,
and my dad's still mad at me.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.124
There you go. And his dad's still mad
at him. Jesus, girlfriend, dish.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.252
Um, well, he thinks
that I'm lying about the glowing.

13:15.336 --> 13:19.173
You know, if this glowing thing is really
having some kind of religious connotation,

13:19.256 --> 13:24.345
it just seems that all the figures
that God sort of challenges or tests,

13:24.428 --> 13:26.889
well, they-- they all kind of
go through it, you know?

13:26.972 --> 13:29.433
I mean, Saint Bartholomew was--
he was skinned.

13:29.517 --> 13:33.354
Um, Hazrat Yusuf was thrown into a well
and sold to slavery by his brothers.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.438
Jesus, Mohsin.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.692
What are you trying to do?
Are you trying to give him more diarrhea

13:38.776 --> 13:41.445
than the level of diarrhea
that he currently is having?

13:41.529 --> 13:44.740
Of course I'm not trying to give him
more diarrhea than the current level.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.116
I'm not some kind of monster.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.118
Well, stop grilling him
while he's got diarrhea.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.995
-Yeah.
-That's not gonna help his system.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.831
-You're gonna be fine.
-Okay.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.916
You'll be fine.
Diarrhea rarely kills people.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.126
We don't even know
that this is a religious thing.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.212
Talking about all this stuff.
We don't know.

13:58.295 --> 14:01.298
Maybe Mohsin was right, maybe you're just
gonna spontaneously combust.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.758
-Mm. Maybe.
-What?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.594
I doubt it. I doubt it.
It's a low, low percentage.

14:05.678 --> 14:10.182
No, look, I think the religious angle is
the only thing that makes any sense to me.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.100
Okay?

14:11.600 --> 14:15.729
What I can't figure out, though,
and no offense for this one, my friend.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.398
But why would anybody pick Clark?

14:17.481 --> 14:20.150
That is-- No offense taken at all, Wendy.
What a great question.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.735
-Why would anyone choose me?
-Well--

14:21.819 --> 14:23.070
So there you go.

14:23.153 --> 14:26.240
I don't know if I think that's
a great question. No offense, Wendy.

14:26.323 --> 14:30.828
But just because Clark is the last person
that you would expect God to choose,

14:30.911 --> 14:33.414
doesn't mean that God chose the wrong guy.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.417
God would probably choose
someone simple. Sweet.

14:36.500 --> 14:40.588
Oh, well, that's not me. I mean, I'm not
simple and sweet. I'm very edgy, actually.

14:41.088 --> 14:44.466
If you're so edgy,
what are your favorite hobbies, Clark?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.051
Oh, thank you so much for asking.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.221
My favorite hobbies would be,
um, taking saunas with my father

14:49.305 --> 14:50.472
and having nice conversations.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.809
-Oh my gosh, I am simple.
-But you're sweet too.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.145
What does this mean?
Do I have to start a ministry?

14:56.228 --> 14:57.229
-No.
-I don't know how to.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.315
I'm not the kind of person
who joins clubs.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.818
I don't know. And if I'm supposed
to help God, I don't know how to do it.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.904
Who said you have to help God?

15:04.987 --> 15:08.657
Uh… no one. He didn't--
he didn't say that anyone said that.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.285
-No one said that. No <i>person </i>said that.
-I was--

15:11.368 --> 15:12.286
-I don't--
-You said it.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.370
He just said it.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.289
-Because you said it.
-I'm not being untruthful.

15:15.372 --> 15:19.376
You're a person. I'm a person.
No person said anything about that.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.629
Right, so no person, I think, but--

15:21.712 --> 15:25.758
Who said you need to help God?
Just getting back to the first question.

15:25.841 --> 15:26.759
You did.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.594
I did? I guess I did.

15:29.136 --> 15:32.348
I think what's happening here
is we've just been too tunnel-visioned.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.934
We're all feeling the stress of it.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.602
-Yeah.
-Maybe I should just take you home.

15:36.685 --> 15:37.895
I don't know if your…

15:38.520 --> 15:41.148
if your system can take
a scooter ride right now.

15:41.231 --> 15:44.360
Oh, actually, no, I-- that--
that sounds really good, and thank you.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.486
My system is actually fine.

15:45.569 --> 15:48.113
You guys were talking a lot about it,
but I don't actually have it.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.574
-You don't have what?
-I don't have…

15:51.241 --> 15:52.743
I don't have diarrhea.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.912
-You don't have what?
-I don't have diarrhea.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.914
Oh, he's saying
he doesn't have diarrhea.

15:56.997 --> 15:57.873
-I--
-Like, after all.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.417
-We thought he had diarrhea. He doesn't.
-I don't.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.586
-Doesn't have it after all.
-It went the other way.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.338
-Oh.
-You're plugged up.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.256
Yeah, but I don't even
like to talk about it.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.467
It's something that sort of--
It was brought to me…

16:08.550 --> 16:10.844
I feel like now I'm talking about it
more than I wanted to.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.513
-It's not--
-Oh my God. People poo!

16:12.596 --> 16:14.181
-Yuck, Tom.
-People poo.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.808
-It's a fact of life! A fact!
-Oh God.

16:15.933 --> 16:19.687
Whether a lot or a little. I poo seven
to eight times a day, and that's normal.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.022
-Jesus!
-Seven to eight times is not normal.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.816
All right, Wendy. The point is

16:23.899 --> 16:26.360
my man and our leader Clark
can keep that bound up if he wants.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.988
Okay, pause.
Since when was Clark our leader?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.656
Yeah, why is Clark our leader?

16:30.739 --> 16:32.658
I didn't make us our leader.
I-- I'm so sorry.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.828
No, no, no, you misunderstand.
Of course he didn't make himself leader.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.998
-And he glows!

16:39.540 --> 16:40.541
Can we go?

16:42.209 --> 16:43.502
Come on. Way ahead of you.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.962
Oh. Bye, guys.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.296
-Bye, Clark.
-See ya, Clark.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.548
On your side, bud.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.053
Hi, Skittles.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.264
Do you like cats?

16:57.850 --> 17:01.812
Um… I can honestly say
that I have almost no opinion of cats.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.897
Oh really? I have two. This is Skittles.

17:03.981 --> 17:07.026
And as you can see,
she's a real snack machine.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.153
They're so sweet. They're so sweet.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.612
Ah! There you go.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.032
All right. All right.
Go play. Go play.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.618
-Mm.
-How you doin', Clark?

17:17.745 --> 17:21.457
You know, uh… I think I'm doing
really good, really well.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.918
You know, just so good.
I'm just kinda… you know, just chillin'.

17:25.002 --> 17:28.172
Just enjoying the evening and just kinda…
Everything's really good.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.674
-You seem really anxious.
-Do I?

17:30.758 --> 17:33.469
You know, that might just be
because, I don't know, um…

17:34.344 --> 17:37.222
You know,
we met an angel, is one thing.

17:37.306 --> 17:41.101
And then, um, you know, apparently, uh…
there's a lot of responsibilities

17:41.185 --> 17:44.021
on my plate for some reason,
even though I didn't ask for it.

17:44.104 --> 17:47.608
It's fine, because who doesn't want them?
Because responsibility's a fine thing.

17:47.691 --> 17:50.903
But, then, also, how do you get God's
message out when you're supposed to--

17:56.200 --> 17:57.451
How do you feel now?

17:58.035 --> 17:59.703
-I feel a lot better. Thank you.
-Mm.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.708
I think everything's gonna be just fine.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.543
<i>Footage of an average-looking man</i>

18:06.627 --> 18:10.130
<i>who, as you can see,</i>
<i>seems to glow with a very bright light.</i>

18:10.214 --> 18:14.051
<i>Our own Susan Storm interviewed</i>
<i>the influential Reverend Milton Throp.</i>

18:14.134 --> 18:17.679
<i>So, Reverend, you're saying this glowing</i>
<i>has a religious reason behind it?</i>

18:18.180 --> 18:20.641
<i>No, I'm saying that</i>
<i>that is exactly what this…</i>

18:20.724 --> 18:24.186
<i>false witness, Clark Thompson,</i>
<i>is trying to make us believe.</i>

18:24.269 --> 18:28.190
<i>To see this deceiver</i>
<i>attempt to confuse our fellow citizens</i>

18:28.273 --> 18:32.194
<i>with false miracles and trickery,</i>
<i>well, it makes me very angry.</i>

18:32.277 --> 18:37.783
This shyster, whoever he is,
is, at best, a charlatan, and at worst

18:38.700 --> 18:40.494
a horrible agent of the Devil.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.037
Agent of the Devil.

18:42.121 --> 18:46.667
I didn't… That did not go
as positively as I had hoped for.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.336
I mean, come on, who is this guy?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.797
He's never met me. He doesn't know me.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.591
I mean,
I think God picked the wrong person.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.885
I don't think he picked the wrong person.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.806
We don't have to watch any more TV.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.934
We could do something entirely different.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.279
For the record, I did not mean to do that.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.322
I like it.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.450
-This is the place!
-I believe in you, Clark!

19:20.534 --> 19:21.743
You're a blasphemer!

19:21.827 --> 19:25.080
Blasphemers like you will burn in hell!
You will burn in hell forever!

19:25.789 --> 19:28.208
Clark, you're the messiah!

19:28.917 --> 19:30.752
I'm really sorry.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.464
I-- I can walk you to your scooter.
I can take you home. I'm so sorry.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.884
I can't say it's not weird, because it's…

19:37.509 --> 19:38.510
it's weird.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.512
I mean, it's-- Yeah, it's batshit.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.849
But maybe if we just drink enough tequila,
it'll seem okay.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.935
I don't really drink, so I'm okay.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.521
Well, you should consider starting.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.772
Charlatan!

19:51.273 --> 19:52.274
Clark!

19:52.357 --> 19:55.277
Clark! Clark!
Clark! Clark! Clark! Clark!

19:55.360 --> 19:57.696
Clark! Clark! Clark! Clark! Clark!
