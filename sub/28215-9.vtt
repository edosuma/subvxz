WEBVTT

00:00.594 --> 00:03.045
And of course the swastikas

00:03.070 --> 00:04.873
that were on the latest newsletter

00:04.898 --> 00:06.309
were supposed to have been octopuses.

00:06.333 --> 00:09.762
I am a very bad artist, and
I apologize to any student

00:09.787 --> 00:10.879
I may have offended.

00:10.904 --> 00:14.463
And... and finally, our
sinks are not urinals,

00:14.488 --> 00:16.376
and our urinals are not sinks.

00:16.402 --> 00:18.286
And that's the last
time I'm gonna say that.

00:18.311 --> 00:23.218
So, uh, our speaker
today taught at Harvard

00:23.251 --> 00:27.544
and very soon hopefully
will be doing a TED Talk.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.513
So we are all very
lucky to be the audience

00:30.538 --> 00:31.658
for his audition tape.

00:31.692 --> 00:33.761
Please welcome Jack Griffin.

00:34.862 --> 00:37.334
Shake.

00:37.359 --> 00:38.401
Thank you, Ralph.

00:38.426 --> 00:41.043
Uh, yes, you are all very
lucky to be here, okay?

00:41.068 --> 00:42.536
If I get this TED Talk gig,

00:42.570 --> 00:45.173
it could catapult my upcoming
book to the best-seller list.

00:45.206 --> 00:48.444
Okay, so, congratulations.
You knew me when.

00:49.626 --> 00:51.746
All right, roll cameras.

00:54.615 --> 00:57.886
Hi, everybody. Hi. Oh,
stop. Please. Thank you.

00:58.300 --> 01:01.738
Um, so my name is Dr. Jack Griffin

01:01.763 --> 01:04.611
and this is my presentation entitled,

01:04.635 --> 01:07.895
"The Pursuit of Happiness
Through Societal Regression."

01:08.369 --> 01:11.339
Now people often ask me, Doctor...

01:11.364 --> 01:12.472
Whoops.

01:15.833 --> 01:18.135
So, uh, uh, people will often ask me,

01:18.160 --> 01:19.260
you know, Doctor...

01:19.285 --> 01:20.508
whoopsie.

01:22.676 --> 01:24.279
Oh, my God, Jack! Jack!

01:24.312 --> 01:26.535
- Oh, my God...
- You okay?

01:26.560 --> 01:28.028
Ralph, Ralph, you gotta
get me out of here, man.

01:28.052 --> 01:29.840
- I'm really hurt.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:29.865 --> 01:31.652
Madison. Madison, come here.

01:31.686 --> 01:33.253
Oh, God! Oh, Ralph!

01:33.286 --> 01:34.338
Okay, we got him.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.590
We got you, it's okay.

01:35.622 --> 01:36.689
Here we go.

01:36.714 --> 01:38.458
Oh, God, Ralph, I'm really hurt.

01:38.491 --> 01:40.261
- Ooh, gosh.
- God, I'm really hurt.

01:40.294 --> 01:42.741
Oh, I'm really hurt.

01:42.766 --> 01:45.600
Ow, oh, oh, oh!

01:45.633 --> 01:47.898
- It's okay.
- Oh, God. Ralph.

01:47.923 --> 01:49.945
Oh, God. Hold my thigh. It's my thigh.

01:49.970 --> 01:51.882
Oh, God. Oh! I really cranked it, Ralph.

01:51.907 --> 01:53.969
No, no, no, don't touch it!
I cranked my thigh, Ralph!

01:53.993 --> 01:54.999
I'm just trying to help.

01:55.024 --> 01:56.919
Oh, but everything you're
doing is making it worse.

01:56.943 --> 01:58.889
Oh, I think there's, like,
a loose bone or something

01:58.913 --> 02:01.225
and my butt is... is... oh,
God, I think I smashed my butt.

02:01.249 --> 02:04.199
Oh, my smashed butt.
Oh, my smashed butt.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.576
Ohh, it's so smashed!

Oh, my God, dude was like, "Whoa!"

02:28.775 --> 02:30.277
"I'm wearing a suit."

02:30.310 --> 02:32.879
Whoopsie, whoopsie, whoopsie.

02:32.912 --> 02:34.348
Happy Monday, ladies.

02:34.382 --> 02:36.783
Jack, you're on WorldStar.

02:36.816 --> 02:38.552
What is WorldStar?

02:38.936 --> 02:40.672
Are you guys watching
a video of me falling?

02:40.697 --> 02:41.856
- Mm-hmm.
- That's not funny.

02:41.888 --> 02:45.259
It's pretty funny, especially
'cause you go, "Doctor whoops."

02:45.293 --> 02:46.761
Doctor Whoopsie!

02:48.353 --> 02:50.744
Like, who actually says
whoopsie when they fall?

02:50.778 --> 02:51.784
Right?

02:51.809 --> 02:54.001
Good morning, Mary, Stef, Michelle,

02:54.035 --> 02:55.803
Dr. Whoopsie.

02:55.835 --> 02:58.005
Hey!

02:58.038 --> 02:59.607
Yeah.

02:59.632 --> 03:02.140
- Are you okay?
- Well, finally somebody asks.

03:02.165 --> 03:03.626
Actually, I'm... I'm doing okay.

03:03.665 --> 03:05.477
Yeah, a little sore
but nothing's broken.

03:05.502 --> 03:06.776
- That's good.
- Yeah.

03:06.801 --> 03:09.058
I thought you were going to
have that smashed butt surgery.

03:09.082 --> 03:10.120
Yeah.

03:10.145 --> 03:12.387
Did you guys hear the
Smashed Butt remix?

03:13.953 --> 03:16.890
♪ Ow it's so smashed,
ow my smashed butt ♪

03:16.924 --> 03:19.627
Everyone, terrible news.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.496
The Daddy's back.

03:21.529 --> 03:23.715
- I'm sorry, what? The Daddy?
- The Sugar Daddy.

03:23.740 --> 03:26.660
Jack, this is Whitlock's
greatest mystery.

03:26.685 --> 03:29.004
Every few months, hundreds
of Sugar Daddy wrappers

03:29.029 --> 03:31.345
mysteriously appear around the school.

03:31.370 --> 03:33.272
This is the work of a real sick puppy.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.524
Perhaps he's not some elusive boogeyman

03:35.549 --> 03:38.079
as much as the 700 Garbage Pail Kids

03:38.104 --> 03:39.380
who roam these halls every day.

03:39.412 --> 03:41.810
You know, just a thought.

03:41.835 --> 03:43.383
You guys, he's not wrong.

03:43.417 --> 03:46.295
But the Sugar Daddy, uh,
he's a serial litterer.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.629
He's malicious, he's psychotic.

03:48.654 --> 03:50.410
I bet he doesn't even
eat the Sugar Daddies.

03:50.435 --> 03:53.215
My theory is based on the
fact that no one ever has.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.410
That can't be true. I mean...

03:54.435 --> 03:56.855
I'm with Lynette. I mean,
those things are gross.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.152
I'm a... I'm a big lollipop guy myself

03:59.177 --> 04:01.706
but I... have to eat them at home

04:01.731 --> 04:03.345
because people think I'm a little boy

04:03.370 --> 04:04.648
and I can't get into restaurants.

04:04.672 --> 04:05.940
Ohh.

04:05.972 --> 04:07.402
Well, all I know

04:08.441 --> 04:11.205
is that I'm determined to
catch this son of a bitch.

04:11.230 --> 04:12.377
Well, we'll help you.

04:12.603 --> 04:13.916
I always know the killer

04:13.941 --> 04:15.650
the first four minutes
of "Law and Order."

04:15.675 --> 04:17.947
Yup, it's never the
second guy they talk to.

04:17.971 --> 04:19.572
It's sometimes the first.

04:19.598 --> 04:20.730
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh!

04:20.755 --> 04:22.242
Ooh and if there's a stepfather,

04:22.266 --> 04:23.468
you know his ass did it.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.804
Mm-hmm.

04:26.605 --> 04:30.376
♪ Mm-hmm ♪

04:35.346 --> 04:36.614
Whoopsie.

04:39.216 --> 04:40.551
Marcus, I know where you live.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.008
I retract my whoopsie.

04:42.033 --> 04:43.117
Yeah.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.192
So I imagine you guys
have all seen this, uh,

04:47.225 --> 04:48.876
video of me that's been going around.

04:48.901 --> 04:50.136
Which version?

04:50.161 --> 04:52.127
My favorite is when
you fall off the stage

04:52.152 --> 04:54.320
into a shark's mouth.

04:54.345 --> 04:56.901
Oh, and then they cut
to a guy on Maury Povich

04:56.935 --> 04:59.052
doing an "I'm not the father" dance.

04:59.053 --> 05:00.766
Yeah, fun.

05:01.432 --> 05:03.069
So this is our mission for today.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.396
We need to delete that video.
Now how do we do that?

05:05.421 --> 05:07.057
Brother, you don't.

05:07.082 --> 05:08.761
It's like when you're
standing on a rooftop

05:08.785 --> 05:10.296
and you shake all the
feathers out of a pillow

05:10.320 --> 05:11.822
and then the next day you say,

05:11.847 --> 05:13.816
"I want to get all those feathers back."

05:14.052 --> 05:15.621
Did you just quote the movie "Doubt"?

05:15.653 --> 05:17.923
I just realized something wonderful.

05:17.956 --> 05:19.720
Whenever anyone looks up "Jack Griffin,"

05:19.745 --> 05:22.388
the first thing that's going
to come up is Doctor Whoopsie.

05:22.413 --> 05:23.420
Well, that's not good.

05:23.445 --> 05:25.396
I'm trying to become the
most famous philosopher

05:25.421 --> 05:27.149
of... of my generation, okay?

05:32.125 --> 05:33.853
Whoa, Vic.

05:33.878 --> 05:35.500
Where's your signature grandpa sweater?

05:35.968 --> 05:38.137
Where's your fancy Harvard job?

05:38.343 --> 05:40.679
Ooh!

05:40.711 --> 05:43.514
Ooh, okay! Nice comeback.

05:43.548 --> 05:46.151
I like this attitude.
I don't know what's going on.

05:46.184 --> 05:47.519
Cool.

05:47.552 --> 05:49.655
All right, so how do we
change the narrative, guys?

05:49.687 --> 05:51.522
You know... I know, I know.

05:51.555 --> 05:54.392
We need to make a more popular
video where I look cool.

05:54.425 --> 05:55.993
So how do we do that?

05:56.026 --> 05:58.096
Uh, Griff, my uncle
agreed to give his kidney

05:58.129 --> 05:59.347
to a total stranger.

05:59.372 --> 06:00.665
It was all over the news.

06:00.699 --> 06:02.668
Everyone in town was talking about it.

06:02.701 --> 06:04.536
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:04.569 --> 06:06.237
I like this, a heroic act.

06:06.271 --> 06:08.140
I mean, people love a feel-good story.

06:08.173 --> 06:10.542
Well, it turned out
the kidney went to a guy

06:10.574 --> 06:13.277
who murdered a bunch of
immigrants in rural Texas.

06:13.310 --> 06:15.346
- So that was a bummer.
- Hmm.

06:15.379 --> 06:18.182
One time I went to Texas and I hated it.

06:18.216 --> 06:20.451
Just like I hate everything else.

06:20.485 --> 06:22.054
Whatever.

06:22.086 --> 06:23.234
What's going on with you, bud?

06:23.258 --> 06:25.390
Somebody steal your
Magic: The Gathering cards?

06:26.057 --> 06:28.360
- You wanna go?
- Oh, my God.

06:28.393 --> 06:30.729
This is great. I like this very much.

06:30.761 --> 06:32.463
I really do. It's a nice new wrinkle.

06:32.488 --> 06:35.325
I mean, just when I thought
I'd get bored with you guys.

06:35.367 --> 06:37.468
All right, so what's
a powerful moving act

06:37.502 --> 06:39.304
that I could get caught on camera doing?

06:39.336 --> 06:41.105
Being a solider coming home to your kid.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.441
Get a cochlear implant

06:42.473 --> 06:44.276
and hear your mom's
voice for the first time.

06:44.308 --> 06:46.755
Okay, well that's for
babies and my mom is dead.

06:46.780 --> 06:47.786
Oh.

06:47.811 --> 06:49.787
I mean, we're building a
Habitat for Humanity house

06:49.811 --> 06:51.724
this Saturday and the
news is gonna be there.

06:51.749 --> 06:53.925
No, no! Guys, no!

06:53.950 --> 06:56.129
This has to be something that
really takes over the airwaves.

06:56.153 --> 06:57.827
You know, think O.J. Bronco.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.155
Think Thai soccer team rescue.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.215
Baby Jessica.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.571
Yeah, Baby Jess... Babe... yeah.

07:03.596 --> 07:05.837
Yes, that's good.

07:05.862 --> 07:07.164
Okay, guys, we got it. All right?

07:07.188 --> 07:08.338
Anybody who wants extra credit,

07:08.362 --> 07:09.962
meet me in the parking lot during lunch.

07:10.996 --> 07:13.366
So Baby Jessica got me thinking about

07:13.391 --> 07:15.347
the brave heroes that saved her.

07:15.372 --> 07:17.209
I mean, that's such a striking image.

07:17.242 --> 07:19.076
A strong noble person

07:19.110 --> 07:20.839
pulling someone up from the depths.

07:20.864 --> 07:23.032
So that's what I'm going to be.

07:23.057 --> 07:25.761
All right, now who's going to
get down in the sewers for me?

07:29.435 --> 07:31.070
Whatever, I'll do it.

07:31.489 --> 07:33.458
Yeah, I don't know, Vic.

07:33.483 --> 07:35.136
I mean, you've been acting
a little off today, bud.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.395
I said I'll do it.

07:36.427 --> 07:38.497
So just get out of my
way right now, please.

07:44.484 --> 07:46.805
This could work. I mean,
Victor makes a good victim.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.297
I mean, that sweet cherubic face.

07:48.321 --> 07:50.056
When the world sees this face

07:50.090 --> 07:53.995
being rescued by these
muscular arms, you know?

07:54.020 --> 07:56.090
All right, let's make this happen.

07:59.196 --> 08:00.864
Oh! Okay, yeah.

08:00.889 --> 08:02.162
You know what? I just remembered.

08:02.186 --> 08:04.498
The city, they started making
these things so that you need

08:04.522 --> 08:06.587
a special device to pull
these manhole covers up,

08:06.612 --> 08:08.762
'cause I think kids were just...

08:10.221 --> 08:11.490
Yeah, I got it, Mr. G.

08:11.717 --> 08:13.284
Yeah, well, I... you know, I...

08:13.309 --> 08:15.746
I loosened the pickle
jar for you there, so...

08:18.004 --> 08:20.006
- Sugar Daddy? Never heard of him.
- _

08:20.031 --> 08:21.265
Come on, Dale.

08:21.290 --> 08:23.539
You know every piece
of trash in this school.

08:23.564 --> 08:25.875
Sorry, can't help you. Janitor's code.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.072
We just want to know where you find

08:28.097 --> 08:29.766
the most Sugar Daddy wrappers.

08:29.791 --> 08:30.792
No can do.

08:30.817 --> 08:31.985
Wait, time out!

08:32.010 --> 08:33.746
What's going on with all these boxes?

08:33.770 --> 08:36.323
Yeah, like, what are you
loading up to leave the school?

08:36.347 --> 08:38.318
And why can't you stop
working for two seconds

08:38.351 --> 08:39.753
and talk to us?

08:39.778 --> 08:41.601
These are empty boxes
going to be recycled.

08:41.626 --> 08:42.895
Hmm.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.732
You know, a janitor really makes

08:44.757 --> 08:46.023
the best kind of litterer, right?

08:46.047 --> 08:47.048
Mm-hmm.

08:47.073 --> 08:49.405
It's like when the doctor
is making the patients sick.

08:49.430 --> 08:52.167
Or when the fireman is the arsonist.

08:52.192 --> 08:54.850
Oh, or when the waiter is rude to you.

08:54.875 --> 08:57.211
I am not the Sugar Daddy!

08:57.236 --> 08:59.773
My advice? Walk away.

08:59.946 --> 09:01.981
These wrappers have been
around for eight years,

09:02.006 --> 09:03.610
and I don't mind it.

09:03.635 --> 09:04.891
Eight years?

09:04.916 --> 09:06.618
Well, that means that
it's not a student.

09:06.643 --> 09:09.119
It certainly rules out
any seven-year-olds.

09:10.815 --> 09:13.422
All right, Bernie, we're all set!

09:13.447 --> 09:15.070
Drive it around to
the side of the school

09:15.095 --> 09:17.031
and leave it next to
the blue recycling bin,

09:17.056 --> 09:18.828
and then next week we'll
break down the boxes

09:18.853 --> 09:20.122
and put 'em in the bins!

09:20.147 --> 09:22.850
Yeah! Get a move on, huh? Make haste!

09:22.875 --> 09:25.611
Whoo!

09:25.636 --> 09:27.539
Ugh, I love this job.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:55.660 --> 09:57.297
All right, well, our little victim

09:57.322 --> 09:58.418
seems to be in place here.

09:58.443 --> 10:00.264
So who's going to call Channel 24

10:00.289 --> 10:02.005
and convince them to get
their camera crew down here?

10:02.029 --> 10:03.516
- I'll do it.
- Uh, you know what?

10:03.541 --> 10:04.759
Let me get somebody else to do it.

10:04.783 --> 10:06.807
Hello? Yes, I'm at Whitlock High

10:06.839 --> 10:07.908
and my friend just fell down a manhole,

10:07.932 --> 10:09.658
and oh, my God, I'm so
scared he's going to die!

10:09.682 --> 10:10.806
The ambulances are on their way.

10:10.830 --> 10:12.068
You're not going to want to miss this.

10:12.092 --> 10:13.499
You need to tell the world
'cause he's going to need

10:13.523 --> 10:14.903
a lot of prayers otherwise he might die.

10:14.927 --> 10:17.498
Hurry, hurry, hurry! They bought it.

10:17.523 --> 10:18.724
- Did they?
- Yes.

10:18.749 --> 10:21.000
Okay, well, as much as it devastates me

10:21.025 --> 10:22.794
to say this, Marcus, good job.

10:22.819 --> 10:23.898
Namaste.

10:23.923 --> 10:27.304
Oh! Oh, don't do that.
That is just the worst.

10:27.329 --> 10:29.365
All right, Victor, when I pull you...

10:31.138 --> 10:32.902
Victor?

10:32.927 --> 10:33.929
Victor?

10:33.954 --> 10:35.356
Oh, boy.

10:36.807 --> 10:38.210
Let me try something here.

10:38.235 --> 10:40.337
Victor!

10:40.362 --> 10:41.897
Victor?

10:42.240 --> 10:45.143
- Yo, Mr. G, you lost Victor!
- Yeah.

10:45.168 --> 10:47.708
Mr. Griffin, is it fair
to say that losing a kid

10:47.733 --> 10:49.635
wasn't the heroic act
you were looking for?

10:49.660 --> 10:51.793
Yeah, Sarika but, you
know, it's not over, okay?

10:51.818 --> 10:52.871
We're not giving up on Victor.

10:52.895 --> 10:54.829
Okay, I'm not giving up on Victor.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.756
Yeah.

10:56.955 --> 10:59.625
Unless we all agree not to say anything.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.252
Mr. Griffin!

11:01.277 --> 11:03.181
- Mr. Griffin!
- I know, that's what I'm saying.

11:03.206 --> 11:05.506
I... I so I should... we'll save him.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.867
Plus, you know, he might
still be alive down there.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.729
Yeah, Marcus, cancel the news crew, man.

11:09.754 --> 11:12.071
Oh, that's not possible.
Can't unring a bell.

11:12.096 --> 11:13.654
It's like when you stand on a rooftop

11:13.679 --> 11:15.124
and you try to shake out all
the feathers from a pillow...

11:15.148 --> 11:16.721
Yeah, from "Doubt"! From "Doubt."

11:16.746 --> 11:18.124
- You love that movie.
- It's a great movie.

11:18.148 --> 11:19.392
- It's great.
- Okay, guys, guys, guys.

11:19.416 --> 11:21.218
Can we just please find our friend?

11:21.243 --> 11:23.656
All right, everybody...
Everybody down in the hole.

11:23.681 --> 11:25.339
- Yep, everybody.
- Ugh.

11:25.364 --> 11:27.142
Lower yourselves into
the hole in the ground.

11:27.167 --> 11:28.968
He'll be somewhere in there.

11:31.872 --> 11:33.383
All right, um, why don't you guys

11:33.408 --> 11:35.315
check down this tunnel here
and I'm gonna look down here.

11:35.339 --> 11:37.241
All right? Here we go.

11:37.897 --> 11:38.983
Victor!

11:39.008 --> 11:41.108
- Victor!
- Victor?

11:41.133 --> 11:42.735
- Vic?
- Yo, Vic!

11:42.769 --> 11:44.905
- Victor?
- Hmm.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.840
Tony don't tango with tunnels.

11:46.872 --> 11:50.042
Uh, I'm gonna stay here and
sing every once in a while.

11:50.075 --> 11:52.745
It'll be like vocal bread crumbs.

11:55.334 --> 11:57.237
Victor!

11:57.262 --> 12:00.266
♪ Lay a whisper ♪

12:00.853 --> 12:03.622

12:30.949 --> 12:33.619
There's the doll heads.

12:33.652 --> 12:35.755
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.958
Oh, no, Ralph. Not this, not these.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.961
Helen! Helen!

12:40.993 --> 12:44.530
Hey, gals! What's up, what's up?

12:44.564 --> 12:46.466
Let me hear you now.

12:46.498 --> 12:48.534
Just the ladies. And scream!

12:48.568 --> 12:50.437
- Okay, hey!
- Hey!

12:53.072 --> 12:55.174
Helen, we've made a major
breakthrough in the case.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.292
Mm-hmm. Dale told us
that the Sugar Daddy

12:57.317 --> 12:59.370
has been doing this for eight years.

12:59.395 --> 13:00.602
It can't be a student.

13:00.627 --> 13:02.362
It's someone we work with!

13:02.387 --> 13:03.440
No, I don't think so.

13:03.465 --> 13:04.834
Oh, come on. Open your eyes.

13:04.859 --> 13:06.527
I mean, it makes perfect sense.

13:06.552 --> 13:09.538
The criminal's always some
sad, middle-aged man in khakis

13:09.563 --> 13:11.165
you would never expect.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.459
No. I think it's a student.

13:13.492 --> 13:17.196
Uh, what is that 22 year
old Sophomore's name, Lucas?

13:17.229 --> 13:18.798
Helen, it's not Lucas.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.801
But we're going to
find out who it is soon.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.935
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

13:27.573 --> 13:30.761
Oh, Ralph, you just got
these candies in here

13:30.786 --> 13:33.189
because you confiscated them, right?

13:34.850 --> 13:37.754
This can't be. This can't be.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.280
I have such doubts!

13:42.722 --> 13:44.424
Victor!

13:48.495 --> 13:50.163
Vic... hey. Vic.

13:50.195 --> 13:52.198
Hey, man, what the hell?

13:52.232 --> 13:53.732
Are you okay?

13:53.766 --> 13:54.833
Like you care.

13:54.867 --> 13:58.472
All you care about it
making love to pretty women.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.977
All right.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.100
This is lining up with
a lot of my nightmares.

14:07.125 --> 14:08.639
Are my teeth still in my mouth?

14:08.664 --> 14:10.700
I don't know, man. Feel
around with your tongue.

14:10.883 --> 14:12.795
Grace, are you sure you
know what you're doing?

14:12.819 --> 14:15.955
Guys, it's just a tunnel.
There's no reason to be afraid.

14:15.988 --> 14:18.023
Maybe we'll see the rat king!

14:18.056 --> 14:19.507
Excuse me? A rat what?

14:19.532 --> 14:20.534
The rat king.

14:20.559 --> 14:22.228
It's when a mob of 50 or more rats

14:22.253 --> 14:23.421
get their tails intertwined

14:23.446 --> 14:25.106
and it becomes an angry vicious creature

14:25.131 --> 14:27.086
that starts to understand
the idea of right and wrong.

14:27.110 --> 14:28.344
Oh, God.

14:28.369 --> 14:29.404
My glasses!

14:29.429 --> 14:31.212
- I'm so... I'm sorry.
- My glasses.

14:31.237 --> 14:32.280
Here, I got them. I got them.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.040
I got 'em.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.262
Here you go.

14:40.985 --> 14:42.154
Here you go.

14:45.708 --> 14:46.826
There you go.

14:46.851 --> 14:48.763
Oh, my God! What was that?

14:48.788 --> 14:50.178
No, no, no! That... that's the rat king!

14:50.202 --> 14:52.138
- The rat king!
- Rat king?

14:54.578 --> 14:56.272
- Rat king!
- Rat king!

14:56.297 --> 14:58.865
Rat king! Let me see! Let me see!

14:58.890 --> 15:01.425
♪ It must've been love ♪

15:01.725 --> 15:05.062
♪ But it's over now ♪

15:05.103 --> 15:08.073
♪ It must have been good ♪

15:08.107 --> 15:10.276
♪ But I lost it somehow ♪

15:10.309 --> 15:11.542
Hell no!

15:11.567 --> 15:13.425
What? We... we can't leave.

15:13.450 --> 15:14.652
Rat king! Rat king!

15:14.677 --> 15:16.769
- But... but Victor.
- Oh, my God, rat king.

15:16.794 --> 15:18.872
I'm gonna stay here and
keep singing for my friend.

15:18.897 --> 15:20.219
Something touched my leg!

15:20.244 --> 15:21.680
Oh, I think I got bit!

15:22.377 --> 15:23.812
That's probably not great.

15:23.837 --> 15:26.076
So what's with the game
of hide and seek, bud?

15:27.226 --> 15:29.996
This charade has gone on long enough.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.566
I'm not the rebel everyone thinks I am.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.464
I'm not heavy metal.

15:35.489 --> 15:39.305
Santana is really more sort
of smooth Latin American jazz.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.008
My parents are getting a divorce.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.679
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that, bud.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.847
So you were, what? Running away.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.117
I just thought that if I
went missing in the sewers,

15:51.150 --> 15:56.590
then my parents would both come
and they'd hug and cry and kiss

15:56.622 --> 15:59.959
and then pray I'm not
dead and then kiss again

15:59.992 --> 16:03.195
and it would be just like Epcot in 2015.

16:05.131 --> 16:08.300
Look, uh, I'm gonna tell you something

16:08.333 --> 16:10.337
as someone who comes
from divorced parents.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.372
Divorce is great, okay?

16:12.405 --> 16:14.874
I mean they probably hate each other.

16:14.906 --> 16:17.394
- They did say that a lot.
- Yeah.

16:17.419 --> 16:19.154
Yeah, and you probably
think that it's your fault

16:19.178 --> 16:22.783
that they're splitting up but it's not.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.627
It is your fault that they
probably stayed together

16:25.651 --> 16:27.086
as long as they did, though.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.164
You know, despite the fact
that you were all miserable.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.992
So hey, good news, you're
all about to be much happier.

16:33.586 --> 16:36.222
Yeah, but look, if... if...

16:36.247 --> 16:37.772
if you need to chat about it some more,

16:37.796 --> 16:39.865
come see me after class, all right?

16:40.332 --> 16:41.501
Yeah.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.170
Want to get out of
this disgusting place?

16:44.203 --> 16:46.039
Yeah, I really have to pee.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.674
Well, hey, we are in the sewer.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.643
You could just cut out the middleman.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.226
- He's here!
- Did you see the rat king?

16:52.251 --> 16:53.515
Sorry, guys.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.776
I've been dealing with a lot lately.

16:55.801 --> 16:57.470
But Mr. Griffin and I

16:57.495 --> 16:59.827
are going to have an
ongoing conversation about it

16:59.852 --> 17:02.254
because it's a very
painful thing for me.

17:02.288 --> 17:05.659
Okay, hey. All right.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.644
Oh, perfect timing.

17:07.669 --> 17:09.294
Now Vic, don't wander off.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.396
Oh!

17:11.431 --> 17:14.034
Whoopsie.

17:17.868 --> 17:19.148
Okay.

17:25.501 --> 17:27.236
Hello, Ralph.

17:27.261 --> 17:28.607
Helen, what are...

17:29.389 --> 17:30.524
What are you doing in here?

17:30.558 --> 17:33.927
Ralph Darius Durbin.

17:33.961 --> 17:36.564
I'm gonna ask you something.

17:36.597 --> 17:40.935
Just once over and over
again until you tell me.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.409
Are you the Sugar Daddy?

17:51.912 --> 17:53.447
I saw you do it.

17:55.155 --> 17:58.158
You messy son of a gun!

17:58.284 --> 17:59.820
Why, Ralph?

17:59.852 --> 18:02.522
Littering. [BLEEP] littering?

18:02.556 --> 18:04.559
I'll tell you why
because I'm sick of having

18:04.591 --> 18:06.627
to be this perfect person all the time.

18:06.659 --> 18:09.496
Mother Teresa wasn't
perfect. Mr. Rogers had flaws.

18:09.530 --> 18:12.833
Even President Trump has
a bit of a sweet tooth.

18:12.866 --> 18:14.435
You lied to me.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.570
I didn't want you
thinking any less of me!

18:16.604 --> 18:18.839
But every now and then,
I had to break a rule too

18:18.871 --> 18:21.541
and I give Dale $20 every time I do it.

18:21.575 --> 18:25.747
Ralph, I would never think less of you.

18:26.614 --> 18:28.616
So what happens now?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.593
Say goodnight to the Sugar Daddy.

18:42.707 --> 18:43.964
Wait a minute.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.666
Oh no! Ralph!

18:50.303 --> 18:51.538
No!

18:51.571 --> 18:54.541
Don't shoot him!

18:54.575 --> 18:56.544
Don't kill him, please!

18:56.577 --> 19:00.513
Oh, dear God, take me!

19:01.915 --> 19:04.618
- The hell?
- I... I've got to say.

19:04.652 --> 19:06.988
I'm very curious as to
why the ambulances and cops

19:07.021 --> 19:08.755
are actually here.

19:08.789 --> 19:11.025
Guys, guys, I'm fine.

19:11.058 --> 19:13.361
I'm just a little sore.

19:15.896 --> 19:18.965
Okay.

19:18.999 --> 19:21.769
Guys, is all this really necessary?

19:23.404 --> 19:24.638
Hey, I know you.

19:24.672 --> 19:25.949
Aren't you that guy Mr. Whoopsie?

19:25.973 --> 19:27.474
Doctor. Yes.

19:27.508 --> 19:29.277
Jesus, are you okay?

19:29.310 --> 19:30.645
Oh, oh yeah. Why?

19:30.677 --> 19:32.713
The stretcher and stuff.
The news is here.

19:32.745 --> 19:34.348
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:34.380 --> 19:35.715
I fell deep down into the sewer.

19:35.749 --> 19:37.360
I'm so glad you're here
to see me like this.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.761
You're very cute when you're injured.

19:38.785 --> 19:40.787
It's a good thing it happens so often.

19:40.820 --> 19:42.822
Oh, actually, if I'm gonna die,

19:42.856 --> 19:44.834
we should probably French
kiss goodbye, don't you think?

19:44.858 --> 19:47.361
No, thanks. Your lips
were just in a sewer.

19:52.098 --> 19:53.800
In what would be the saddest edition

19:53.833 --> 19:55.368
of "Where Are They Now?",

19:55.402 --> 19:58.234
recent internet
sensation, Doctor Whoopsie

19:58.259 --> 20:00.041
is back to his bumbling antics.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.542
This time, he's fallen into a sewer.

20:02.576 --> 20:06.105
The maladroit doofus, who some
claim was a Harvard professor,

20:06.130 --> 20:08.749
was just dragged from
the depths behind me.

20:08.781 --> 20:11.034
Now authorities were
initially called to the scene

20:11.059 --> 20:12.520
for a missing child alert.

20:12.552 --> 20:13.817
That was me!

20:14.554 --> 20:15.989
I was missing.

20:16.022 --> 20:18.559
We have a Channel 24 exclusive here.

20:18.591 --> 20:20.527
This is the missing sewer boy.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.530
What's your name? Are you okay?

20:22.562 --> 20:23.863
I'm Victor,

20:23.896 --> 20:25.765
and to be completely
honest with you, Sandra,

20:25.799 --> 20:27.368
I'm not doing great.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.446
Uh, hey, lipstick, I got
your sound bite right here.

20:29.470 --> 20:32.073
It appears another sewer
child is ready to speak.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.973
We never would've
gotten out of that sewer

20:34.006 --> 20:36.710
if it wasn't for our
teacher, Jack Griffin.

20:36.743 --> 20:38.945
He also helped me through
an emotional crisis

20:38.979 --> 20:40.948
and he has generously
offered me further counsel.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.009
Yeah, Mr. Griffin saved us.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.929
There's a legit rat king
down there. We saw it, Sandy.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.819
Oh, he dove into the massive
rats without any regard

20:48.844 --> 20:51.202
for himself effortlessly
detangling their tails

20:51.227 --> 20:52.893
and dethroning the rat king!

20:52.925 --> 20:54.729
We all could have gotten rabies,

20:54.762 --> 20:57.464
but instead we got a hero.

20:59.733 --> 21:01.469
Victor?

21:01.502 --> 21:02.736
Play it again.

21:02.770 --> 21:04.137
You got it.

21:04.171 --> 21:06.607
In what would be the saddest edition

21:06.639 --> 21:08.007
of "Where Are They Now?",

21:08.041 --> 21:10.043
recent internet
sensation, Doctor Whoopsie,

21:10.077 --> 21:12.146
is back to his bumbling antics.

21:12.178 --> 21:14.982
The maladroit doofus, who some
claim was a Harvard professor,

21:15.014 --> 21:17.918
was just dragged from
the depths behind me.
