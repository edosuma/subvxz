01:29.688 --> 01:33.325
What are you doing?
You want a burn
and a broken leg?

01:33.325 --> 01:36.762
Goodness. You are as stubborn
as the horse you fell off of.

01:36.762 --> 01:40.766
I thought I could at least
help you out with something
around here, you know.

01:40.766 --> 01:42.468
Oh, Dad, is this
breakfast for dinner again?

01:42.468 --> 01:44.236
You know, you know that.
That's my specialty.

01:44.236 --> 01:46.238
Everybody knows I like
breakfast for dinner.

01:46.238 --> 01:48.807
Besides, it's better
than watching everybody
else work around here.

01:48.807 --> 01:51.744
Oh, well, nothing would take you
away from your real work, Dad.

01:51.744 --> 01:53.212
Which is?

01:53.212 --> 01:55.414
Barking orders at
everyone else, of course.

01:55.414 --> 01:57.750
Samantha,
will you listen to me?

01:57.750 --> 02:00.786
Even with your sister
coming down with Ben
to help out around here,

02:00.786 --> 02:03.556
I don't know if we're going
to have enough help to take
care of the business.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.925
Dad, we'll be fine.
You and Mama raised
me right.

02:05.925 --> 02:07.093
That we did, you know.

02:07.093 --> 02:09.328
But you can't take on
the whole organization
by yourself.

02:09.328 --> 02:10.863
There's just too much to do.

02:10.863 --> 02:12.965
You haven't got enough
arms and legs to take care
of it all.

02:12.965 --> 02:15.367
Dad, we talked about that.

02:15.367 --> 02:17.870
Bottom line, we're just
going to need some more
help here.

02:17.870 --> 02:21.307
This a family operated
and owned business,

02:21.307 --> 02:22.875
and I would like it
to stay that way.

02:22.875 --> 02:26.312
Well, there's a wealthy
young man that could be
part of the family

02:26.312 --> 02:27.880
if you'd just marry him.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.682
You did not
just go there.

02:29.682 --> 02:30.683
Go where?

02:30.683 --> 02:33.752
Dad just wants to marry
me off to save the farm.

02:33.752 --> 02:35.825
That might not be
such a bad idea.

02:39.825 --> 02:41.362
Seriously?

02:43.362 --> 02:45.598
Good morning, Nikki.

02:45.598 --> 02:46.567
Good morning.

02:48.567 --> 02:52.438
So, Mr. Hampton called.
He wants to reschedule
for after the holidays.

02:52.438 --> 02:55.641
Oh, great. See, here we go.
The grand exodus.

02:55.641 --> 02:57.710
Doesn't anybody like
to work anymore?

02:57.710 --> 03:00.879
It's like the holidays
get here sooner
and sooner every year.

03:00.879 --> 03:02.915
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

03:02.915 --> 03:04.450
(sighs)

03:04.450 --> 03:05.018
I can't even begin
to imagine,

03:06.018 --> 03:09.455
what I'm supposed to get
a 12-year-old girl that's
going to make her happy.

03:09.455 --> 03:11.323
Mmm. Maybe some freedom.

03:11.323 --> 03:12.591
Oh, that's funny.

03:12.591 --> 03:14.330
That's funny.
You took a funny pill
this morning, Nikki.

03:18.330 --> 03:19.865
(knock on door)

03:19.865 --> 03:21.968
Chloe's school
is on the line.

03:22.968 --> 03:24.005
Michael Thompson.

03:26.005 --> 03:27.441
She did what?

03:29.441 --> 03:32.713
Yes. Yes,
I'll be right down.

03:34.713 --> 03:38.651
Apparently,
Chloe flushed a girl's
phone down the toilet.

03:38.651 --> 03:41.487
Well, Chloe's got
an early holiday, too.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.824
It appears so.

03:45.824 --> 03:46.992
(sighs)

03:46.992 --> 03:51.830
Okay... You know, maybe you
and Chloe need a holiday away,

03:51.830 --> 03:52.031
an escape from all this.

03:53.031 --> 03:56.035
Come on. People don't take
vacations during the holidays.

03:56.035 --> 03:57.303
You know how
expensive that is?

03:57.303 --> 03:59.738
Maybe you could make
a little extra income
while you're at it.

03:59.738 --> 04:00.839
What are you getting at?

04:00.839 --> 04:03.609
My cousins.
They own this horse farm.

04:03.609 --> 04:05.978
Actually, I spent a lot
of time out there when
I was growing up,

04:05.978 --> 04:09.348
and it is in the
middle of nowhere,
but it's great.

04:09.348 --> 04:11.350
It's fresh air
and good food.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.952
Maybe it's just the thing
you and Chloe need.

04:13.952 --> 04:15.021
Are you actually suggesting
that I go do farm work?

04:16.021 --> 04:17.790
(stammers) Yeah... No.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.725
But my uncle,
he called the other day,

04:19.725 --> 04:21.392
asked if I could
recommend an accountant.

04:21.392 --> 04:22.028
Maybe somebody from my
firm would be interested?

04:23.028 --> 04:24.997
And I didn't think much
about it at the time.

04:24.997 --> 04:28.334
Maybe you guys could
help each other out.

04:28.334 --> 04:31.103
Nikki, you know how many
accounts I have. You know
I can't leave the office.

04:31.103 --> 04:33.572
Aha! But you have this

04:33.572 --> 04:36.842
amazing executive assistant
who knows all your accounts

04:36.842 --> 04:39.912
and actually needs something
to do, since you forbade her
from going on coffee runs.

04:39.912 --> 04:41.814
You send me
the information,

04:41.814 --> 04:42.881
maybe I'll call them.

04:42.881 --> 04:45.451
I promise you,
you won't regret it.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.987
Thank you for
always looking out.

04:48.987 --> 04:50.490
Somebody needs to.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.129
This is beautiful.
Look at that horse.

05:30.129 --> 05:32.798
I said, look
at the horse.

05:32.798 --> 05:34.767
It's beautiful here.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.135
Yeah.

05:36.135 --> 05:38.804
I know I sprang this on
you at the last minute,

05:38.804 --> 05:41.173
and I took you away
from your favorite
TV shows,

05:41.173 --> 05:43.742
but this change is
going to do us good.

05:43.742 --> 05:46.413
It's going to give us
some father-daughter time.

05:47.413 --> 05:48.482
This is a big change.

05:50.482 --> 05:53.952
You know, if I put hay
in my teeth and wear denim
overalls, I'll fit right in.

05:53.952 --> 05:55.855
Don't be smart.

05:56.855 --> 05:58.426
Maybe, lose the
pink hair, will you?

06:00.426 --> 06:02.644
Sure, Dad.
I'm right on it.

06:18.644 --> 06:19.548
Michael: Hi!

06:22.548 --> 06:24.683
-This the Harrison farm?
-Maybe.

06:24.683 --> 06:26.151
I'm looking for
Cliff Harrison.

06:26.151 --> 06:27.753
Do you know where
I might find him?

06:27.753 --> 06:29.022
(clicks tongue)
He's unavailable.

06:30.022 --> 06:31.690
Uh...

06:31.690 --> 06:33.058
I'm Michael Thompson.

06:33.058 --> 06:36.595
I'm the accountant.
I-- I just spoke with Cliff.

06:36.595 --> 06:37.030
Yeah, must've
been that fall.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.965
You know he fell off
his horse and hit his head,

06:39.965 --> 06:42.634
and he's completely
cuckoo-bananas.

06:42.634 --> 06:45.170
I'm really sorry
you had to drive out here
and waste your time.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.740
Come on, Dad,
let's just go.

06:48.740 --> 06:49.007
If it's all the same to you,

06:50.007 --> 06:52.144
I just drove all the way
out here with my daughter,

06:52.144 --> 06:53.712
I would really like to speak
with your boss.

06:53.712 --> 06:54.981
I'm the boss.

06:55.981 --> 06:58.083
Not according
to my assistant, Nikki.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.918
Nikki is in
on this, too?

06:59.918 --> 07:02.889
Dad, does everybody know
about this, except for me?

07:03.889 --> 07:05.991
Michael, I'm glad to see
you made it okay, bud.

07:05.991 --> 07:08.994
There he is, Mr. Harrison.
A pleasure.

07:08.994 --> 07:10.029
Yeah, I see you've met
my daughter, Sam.

07:11.029 --> 07:12.633
Yes, it appears so.

07:14.633 --> 07:16.735
Why don't we go
inside and talk some?

07:16.735 --> 07:18.271
Chloe, do you want
to come inside with me?

07:19.271 --> 07:21.039
Um... Thanks, I'm good.

07:21.039 --> 07:22.274
Give me a few minutes.

07:22.274 --> 07:23.143
Chloe: Whatever.

07:25.143 --> 07:27.114
You know, my grandson's
out here somewhere. He'll be
happy to show you around.

07:29.114 --> 07:31.751
Okay. You want
to join us, Sam?

07:32.751 --> 07:34.187
No, thanks.
I'm good.

07:35.187 --> 07:37.823
Okay.
Right this way, Michael.

07:37.823 --> 07:38.617
Shall we?

08:05.617 --> 08:06.053
Hello!

08:08.053 --> 08:09.855
Hello?

08:09.855 --> 08:10.624
Anyone there?

08:12.624 --> 08:14.326
-Hey!
-There you are.

08:14.326 --> 08:15.694
Let's try this again.

08:15.694 --> 08:16.896
Hi, I'm Jackson.

08:17.896 --> 08:19.164
And?

08:19.164 --> 08:20.065
You are?

08:20.065 --> 08:23.068
Chloe. Happy now?

08:23.068 --> 08:25.203
So, are you here
for riding lessons?

08:25.203 --> 08:27.606
'Cause if so, you're not
really dressed for it.

08:27.606 --> 08:29.875
Riding lessons?

08:29.875 --> 08:32.177
No. I'm here
with my dad.

08:32.177 --> 08:34.913
Without choice, BTW.

08:34.913 --> 08:35.948
"BTW"?

08:35.948 --> 08:38.082
"By the way."

08:38.082 --> 08:39.889
How can you
not know that?

08:43.889 --> 08:46.592
So is your dad here
for riding lessons?

08:46.592 --> 08:48.895
No. He's an accountant.

08:49.895 --> 08:52.631
Actually, he's
meeting with someone.

08:52.631 --> 08:56.234
Even though he told me
that we are supposed to be
spending some time together.

08:56.234 --> 08:57.736
And here I am,

08:57.736 --> 08:59.037
alone,

08:59.037 --> 09:00.005
again.

09:01.005 --> 09:02.380
Yay.

09:08.380 --> 09:10.217
So is this your
first time on a farm?

09:12.217 --> 09:13.288
No...

09:16.288 --> 09:17.956
Yes.

09:17.956 --> 09:19.025
Well, what you think?

09:20.025 --> 09:23.096
Um, it's pretty and all.

09:24.096 --> 09:25.033
You guys do use
computers, right?

09:28.033 --> 09:30.035
-What?
-Hey, guys!

09:30.035 --> 09:31.970
You must be Chloe,
Michael's daughter.

09:31.970 --> 09:33.305
I'm Sydney.

09:33.305 --> 09:34.973
I guess you've already
met Jackson.

09:34.973 --> 09:37.342
Uh, yes, ma'am.
It's nice to meet you.

09:37.342 --> 09:39.144
Pleased to meet you.

09:39.144 --> 09:41.113
So what's her name?

09:41.113 --> 09:44.684
That's Holly.
Do you want to meet her?

09:45.684 --> 09:48.220
(chuckles) No.
I shouldn't.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.392
I'm waiting for my dad.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.059
You know what?
Yeah, I'd love to.

09:55.059 --> 09:56.929
Okay. Come on.

09:57.929 --> 10:01.967
My grand-daddy
started this place
with 40 acres

10:01.967 --> 10:04.870
and a little shack
out back on the pond.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.172
And he put all his
money he had into it.

10:07.172 --> 10:09.274
And my daddy did, too.

10:09.274 --> 10:11.410
So, that being said,
I think you can understand,

10:11.410 --> 10:12.978
I'd hate to be
the one to lose it.

10:12.978 --> 10:14.279
Absolutely, sir.

10:14.279 --> 10:16.748
It certainly is a...
It's a beautiful piece of land.

10:16.748 --> 10:17.016
Thank you.

10:18.016 --> 10:19.451
How deep is the trouble?

10:19.451 --> 10:21.854
It's, uh...

10:22.854 --> 10:24.291
My wife, some years back...

10:26.291 --> 10:27.759
she got very ill,

10:27.759 --> 10:31.296
and we had a flood
at the same time that
wiped out a lot of the barns

10:31.296 --> 10:33.265
and some of the land here,
on the property.

10:33.265 --> 10:37.269
I had to levy the farm
to take care of the repairs,

10:37.269 --> 10:40.807
and things started to turn
around. I thought we were
going to make it...

10:41.807 --> 10:44.409
And then when
my wife passed, I...

10:44.409 --> 10:48.814
things went downhill from there
and we never really recovered.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.182
We're lucky to still
be here today.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.851
Well, I'm sorry
for your loss.

10:52.851 --> 10:57.824
I'm not sure if you're
aware, I lost my wife
as well last year.

10:58.824 --> 11:03.161
Nikki told me.
I'm sorry for that. I...

11:03.161 --> 11:05.965
I hope things are better
for you and your little girl.
I really do.

11:06.965 --> 11:08.266
Not easy, is it?

11:08.266 --> 11:09.467
No, it's not.

11:09.467 --> 11:12.838
Well, why don't we
concentrate on something
we can control.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.206
Sounds good.

11:14.206 --> 11:17.375
Um, what is the bottom line?
What do you owe the bank?

11:17.375 --> 11:20.312
Well, right now we owe
the bank about $200,000.

11:20.312 --> 11:21.981
Okay.

11:21.981 --> 11:25.350
Thing is, they said
they want it by December 26th
or they're going to foreclose.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.319
Wow! Merry Christmas, huh?

11:27.319 --> 11:28.021
(scoffs) Yeah.

11:29.021 --> 11:33.291
Well, Mr. Harrison,
I'm going to need to get into
your books as soon as possible.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.460
Well, that's going to be
another problem.

11:35.460 --> 11:38.363
Our books are real messy
and they always have been,

11:38.363 --> 11:40.165
and they're probably
a little worse off now

11:40.165 --> 11:41.834
since my daughter has
tried to organize things.

11:41.834 --> 11:45.871
You're talking about Sam,
who I met outside? That's...
who's... handling... the books?

11:45.871 --> 11:47.339
Sam, yeah.
That's the one.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.274
You met my daughter
at her best, I think.

11:49.274 --> 11:51.511
No, she seems
really nice.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.046
She doesn't want me
here, does she?

11:55.046 --> 11:56.916
You're a smart man,
Mr. Thompson.

11:57.916 --> 11:59.085
Welcome to the family.

12:00.085 --> 12:01.356
Thanks.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.125
Hey! Not so fast.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.693
How come nobody
told me about this?

12:08.693 --> 12:13.231
You know that we need help
with the books. I can't do
this anymore all by myself.

12:13.231 --> 12:14.399
Then I'll help you.

12:14.399 --> 12:16.336
You failed algebra. Twice!

12:18.336 --> 12:20.472
But I got an
"A" in economics.

12:20.472 --> 12:24.976
Uh, yeah, that's because
Ray Ellis was in love with
you and helped you cheat.

12:24.976 --> 12:27.913
Look, I know that you
don't want to hear this,

12:27.913 --> 12:29.381
but we need help.

12:29.381 --> 12:32.450
Come on, Syd, did you
see the car that
he drove up in?

12:32.450 --> 12:34.286
You can't be any more
city than that.

12:34.286 --> 12:35.987
You can't trust
a man like that.

12:35.987 --> 12:37.155
He's Nikki's boss.

12:37.155 --> 12:40.158
She raved about him.
Maybe you should give
him a chance.

12:40.158 --> 12:42.260
Besides,
he's kind of cute.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.429
Okay, the fact that the man
is hot has nothing to do

12:44.429 --> 12:46.364
with whether we can trust
him with our farm or not.

12:46.364 --> 12:47.933
Oh! He's hot?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.034
Yeah, he's hot.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.370
The accountant
is hot?

12:52.370 --> 12:53.611
I didn't know
you cared.

12:59.611 --> 13:03.450
Never trust a man,
wing-tip-high
in horse manure.

13:05.450 --> 13:08.620
She means horse poop,
on your shoes.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.524
Welcome to the country,
city boy.

13:12.524 --> 13:13.366
Thanks.

13:21.366 --> 13:23.235
Hi.

13:23.235 --> 13:26.972
Your father asked me
to come and ask you to
take a look at the books.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.741
Well, it's fine.

13:28.741 --> 13:32.244
But just so you know, I still
think that your being here is
a complete waste of time.

13:32.244 --> 13:35.881
Yeah, you know,
I kind of gathered that.

13:35.881 --> 13:40.352
But why don't you just allow
me to do what I came here to do,
which is simply to help you.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.156
(sighs)

13:45.156 --> 13:46.958
Is there where
I'm going to be?

13:46.958 --> 13:49.227
No.

13:49.227 --> 13:50.596
Let me show you where
you're going to be.

13:51.596 --> 13:53.078
Great.

14:07.078 --> 14:08.680
Okay.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.582
This is where
you will be.

14:10.582 --> 14:13.386
This is your office.

14:14.386 --> 14:15.587
You've gotta be
kidding me.

14:15.587 --> 14:16.955
Uh-uh.

14:16.955 --> 14:20.592
Uh... I pulled everything,
so you should have
all the financials here.

14:20.592 --> 14:21.528
Good to go?

14:23.528 --> 14:24.931
Really?

14:25.931 --> 14:30.468
You know, I'm not so sure that
I'm cut out for this kind of...

14:30.468 --> 14:31.039
accounting.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.309
Well, at least somebody
agrees with me.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.210
How many cattle
do you have?

14:39.210 --> 14:42.047
And what's your expected
rate of return per head?

14:42.047 --> 14:45.483
Okay, we don't have cattle.
This is a horse farm.

14:45.483 --> 14:48.053
How do you make
money off horses?

14:48.053 --> 14:49.455
What?

14:50.455 --> 14:51.656
Hey, Sam!

14:51.656 --> 14:53.959
-Sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Parker just showed up.
-Hey!

14:53.959 --> 14:56.561
He said he needs to talk
to you. Seemed urgent.

14:56.561 --> 14:59.230
Oh, okay.
Thanks, Ben.

14:59.230 --> 15:02.200
Um, you... don't move!

15:02.200 --> 15:03.402
I'll be right back.

15:04.402 --> 15:06.504
Hey, I'm Ben.
Sydney's husband.

15:06.504 --> 15:09.274
-Sydney?
-Sam's sister,
little less cranky.

15:09.274 --> 15:12.510
Oh, right. Yeah!
Michael Thompson.
I'm your new CPA.

15:12.510 --> 15:13.979
Well, I, for one,
am glad you're here.

15:13.979 --> 15:16.414
Wow! That makes one of you.

15:16.414 --> 15:19.451
Sam, she's just
a little stubborn.
Give her some time.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.753
She didn't like me
back when I married
Sydney either.

15:21.753 --> 15:24.054
Worried about losing
her sister and all.

15:24.054 --> 15:25.523
We're good as
gravy now though.

15:25.523 --> 15:26.591
How long did that take?

15:26.591 --> 15:28.360
Ah, you know...
Five years.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.762
Mmm.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.197
Anyways, I gotta get
out to the runs. We'll
be seeing you around?

15:32.197 --> 15:34.632
Yeah. Hey,
nice to meet you.

15:34.632 --> 15:37.535
Go take care of those...

15:37.535 --> 15:38.408
runs.

15:43.408 --> 15:44.709
She's taller
than I thought.

15:44.709 --> 15:46.611
What? You've never
seen a horse before?

15:46.611 --> 15:49.247
Well, only the ones
in the parades.

15:49.247 --> 15:52.018
There's always that guy
who's, like, following behind
and picking up the horse crap.

15:53.018 --> 15:56.722
Ben: Somebody's got to do it.
Horses aren't really
housebroken.

15:57.722 --> 15:59.190
Who do we have here?

15:59.190 --> 16:01.059
Dad, this is Chloe,
the accountant's daughter.

16:01.059 --> 16:02.093
Hey!

16:02.093 --> 16:03.695
I see you're already
up on a horse.

16:03.695 --> 16:05.130
Holly here is one
of our favorites.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.033
She's out little
Christmas angel. Oh!

16:08.033 --> 16:09.501
And this here's King.

16:09.501 --> 16:12.370
He's real smart,
but he's also
real stubborn.

16:12.370 --> 16:14.239
Yeah, he's not
the only one.

16:14.239 --> 16:16.541
Mr. Parker just showed up
to talk to Sam.
It sounded serious.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.376
-Oh!
-Everything okay, Dad?

16:18.376 --> 16:20.078
Yeah, everything's fine.

16:20.078 --> 16:21.579
Has Chloe been
out for a ride yet?

16:21.579 --> 16:23.715
No, I just got
her up there.

16:23.715 --> 16:26.184
-Why don't I
take her around?
-That'd be great.

16:26.184 --> 16:27.719
Well, we tend
to think so.

16:27.719 --> 16:31.456
And if you stick around
for a little while, I'll even
give you riding lessons.

16:31.456 --> 16:35.627
Thanks, but I don't really
think that my dad would pay
for me to get on a horse.

16:35.627 --> 16:38.663
Well, you know,
just consider it
a Christmas gift.

16:38.663 --> 16:39.798
Around here,

16:39.798 --> 16:42.735
we believe that
anyone who wants
to ride, should.

16:43.735 --> 16:45.611
I like that.

16:53.611 --> 16:56.816
(laughing)
You've gotta be kidding me.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.685
Mr. Parker. Hi.
Heard something
was urgent.

17:00.685 --> 17:02.687
How are you doing?

17:02.687 --> 17:04.823
Well, Sam, we're
making some changes.

17:04.823 --> 17:07.694
We are moving our
horses to the K&T.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.865
Oh, wow! Mr. Parker...

17:13.865 --> 17:17.670
You have had your
mares here with us
for eight years.

17:18.670 --> 17:21.271
I'm sorry, I really am.

17:21.271 --> 17:25.276
I would like to stay here
with you, but you know,
times are hard.

17:25.276 --> 17:26.678
And honestly,

17:26.678 --> 17:29.182
K&T has made me
an amazing offer.

17:31.182 --> 17:34.119
It isn't because they
won two championships
in two years?

17:34.119 --> 17:38.189
No, no, no. Listen, Sam.
You know I've always had
my horses here with you.

17:38.189 --> 17:41.860
Heck, you even taught
my daughters how to ride.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.331
And that's what has made it
difficult for me to decide.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.366
Is there anything I can
say to change your mind?

17:48.366 --> 17:49.569
Sure, if you can
match their prices.

17:51.569 --> 17:52.705
I can't.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.807
I'm sorry,
I know you can't.

17:55.807 --> 17:58.910
Listen, this is
nothing personal, Sam.

17:58.910 --> 18:01.379
It's just business.

18:01.379 --> 18:03.882
So we will stick with you
through the holidays.

18:03.882 --> 18:04.017
Okay.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.556
-And give your
father my best.
-Oh, I will. No problem.

18:11.556 --> 18:13.193
(whispering) I thought
I told you to stay put.

18:15.193 --> 18:16.461
Maybe after I go
through the books,

18:16.461 --> 18:19.664
I can find a way
to make your prices
a little more competitive.

18:19.664 --> 18:22.233
Look, we don't
need an accountant,

18:22.233 --> 18:24.736
and we certainly don't need
a marketing director either,
okay?

18:24.736 --> 18:28.439
Look, Sam, I'm only here
because somebody asked me
to be here.

18:28.439 --> 18:29.774
-Okay?
-(sighs)

18:29.774 --> 18:32.877
I mean, if you're this
passionate about me
leaving, I can go.

18:32.877 --> 18:36.549
I'm just going to have to hear
it from your father, since he's
the one that hired me. Okay?

18:37.549 --> 18:38.816
Fine.

18:38.816 --> 18:39.789
Good.

18:44.789 --> 18:45.925
Chloe?

18:46.925 --> 18:49.628
Chloe! Chloe!

18:50.628 --> 18:53.298
Chloe RenÃ©e Thompson,
are you trying to get
yourself killed?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.900
Hold on, you're gonna
spook the horse.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.468
What do you think you're
doing, young lady? You get
down from there right now.

18:57.468 --> 18:59.637
Sydney, what is going on?
What is she doing up there?

18:59.637 --> 19:01.239
Did she sign a
liability release?

19:01.239 --> 19:03.208
A proof of insurance?
Anything?

19:03.208 --> 19:04.509
Come on, Sam!

19:04.509 --> 19:05.877
Is there a problem, Michael?

19:05.877 --> 19:08.479
You bet there is.
This whole adventure
has been a big mistake.

19:08.479 --> 19:09.847
Are you okay?

19:09.847 --> 19:11.816
I'm fine, Dad.
What's the big deal?

19:11.816 --> 19:14.986
The big deal is, is that
you got on a horse
without my permission.

19:14.986 --> 19:16.354
You could've fallen off.

19:16.354 --> 19:18.656
Mr. Harrison's been
riding for years and
he just broke his leg.

19:18.656 --> 19:20.327
He could've killed himself.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.795
You know what?

19:23.795 --> 19:25.863
Get your stuff.
We're gonna leave.

19:25.863 --> 19:27.899
What stuff?
I haven't even
unpacked yet!

19:27.899 --> 19:29.934
Then wait for me in the car.
I'm gonna get my briefcase.

19:29.934 --> 19:30.902
I'm sorry, Michael.

19:30.902 --> 19:33.338
I promise you, your daughter
was in good hands.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.273
And in my dad's defense,
he was on King,

19:35.273 --> 19:37.742
doing a trick that no man
his age should ever attempt.

19:37.742 --> 19:40.545
Look, I'm sure you're
all really nice people,

19:40.545 --> 19:44.782
but this whole situation
isn't exactly what I was
told it was going to be.

19:44.782 --> 19:45.917
I think you're right, Sam.

19:45.917 --> 19:48.419
I think us city folk probably
don't belong out here.

19:48.419 --> 19:49.988
Are you sure
about that?

19:49.988 --> 19:53.291
She's pretty good, Michael.
She really took to riding.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.329
She'd do great
with some training.

19:58.329 --> 20:01.366
And didn't my dad
already give you
a down payment?

20:01.366 --> 20:04.769
Yes, he gave me a retainer,
and I am happy to give it back.

20:04.769 --> 20:07.538
-Wait a minute,
he's already been paid?
-Mmm-hmm.

20:07.538 --> 20:09.407
Yeah, you think I would
drive all the way out here

20:09.407 --> 20:11.944
in the middle of
no-man's land for nothing?

20:12.944 --> 20:14.879
Okay, you can stay.

20:14.879 --> 20:16.781
Chloe: Really?

20:16.781 --> 20:17.816
Wait a minute...

20:17.816 --> 20:21.419
I'm the one who's leaving.
This is my decision.

20:21.419 --> 20:23.821
Fine, but you've
already been paid.

20:23.821 --> 20:25.857
So you can leave and ruin
your daughter's Christmas,

20:25.857 --> 20:28.860
or you could stay
and do the job you've
been hired to do.

20:28.860 --> 20:29.669
Your choice.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.304
Sam:
Hey!

20:39.304 --> 20:41.873
What are you doing, Dad?
Why are you awake?

20:41.873 --> 20:45.042
Now, I gotta ask you
the same thing, little lady.

20:45.042 --> 20:47.847
Ah, you know, spreading
my holiday cheer.

20:49.847 --> 20:51.649
(sighs) And you?

20:51.649 --> 20:54.719
Well, you know, the usual,
just moving money around.

20:54.719 --> 20:57.055
Make sure that
we don't have another
bounced check this month.

20:57.055 --> 21:00.391
Isn't that what you hired that
city slicker accountant to do?

21:00.391 --> 21:01.326
Yeah.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.394
Why don't you go to bed,
Dad? Get some rest.

21:03.394 --> 21:05.963
I will, I will, honey.
I just...

21:05.963 --> 21:08.933
need a few more minutes
to make sure that I haven't
missed anything.

21:08.933 --> 21:10.570
(sighs) Hey, Dad...

21:11.570 --> 21:14.407
you remember what Mom said
right before she passed away?

21:16.407 --> 21:20.945
"I want you to spread
my ashes across that farm

21:20.945 --> 21:24.850
so every piece of me
can protect and watch
over all of you."

21:25.850 --> 21:27.753
Remember that?

21:28.753 --> 21:29.989
Yeah, I remember, yeah.

21:31.989 --> 21:32.525
Dad...

21:34.525 --> 21:36.931
I'm not going
to let anything
happen to this farm.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.567
I know, yeah.

21:42.567 --> 21:45.136
-We'll figure it out.
-Yeah.

21:45.136 --> 21:46.707
Okay.

21:49.707 --> 21:52.377
Hey... I love you.

21:52.377 --> 21:53.779
I love you, too.

21:54.779 --> 21:55.694
(knocking on door)

22:09.694 --> 22:10.137
(sighs)

22:19.137 --> 22:20.477
(knocking continues)

22:26.477 --> 22:27.745
What time is it?

22:27.745 --> 22:29.747
What are you doing?
Why are you dressed?

22:29.747 --> 22:32.484
-(knocking continues)
-I'm expecting someone.

22:33.484 --> 22:34.953
What?

22:35.953 --> 22:37.021
Morning!

22:38.021 --> 22:40.858
-It is?
-It certainly is.
Chloe, are you ready?

22:40.858 --> 22:42.960
-Ready... for what?
-Yeah!

22:42.960 --> 22:46.798
Uh, jeans, warm coat,
everything you said...
Only I don't have gloves.

22:46.798 --> 22:48.833
We'll get you some
work gloves.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.034
"Work gloves"?

22:50.034 --> 22:53.069
But, wait a minute.
How hard did I just
hit my head?

22:53.069 --> 22:56.741
Ooh, Michael, I can see why
Sam thinks that you're hot.

22:56.741 --> 22:58.810
Ew! If by hot
you mean tragic!

22:58.810 --> 23:00.912
Ha-ha-ha!
Where do you
think you're going?

23:00.912 --> 23:03.079
She's going to come work
with me and Jackson today.

23:03.079 --> 23:04.649
Work?

23:04.649 --> 23:06.818
Oh, come on, Dad,
give me a break.

23:06.818 --> 23:08.586
Wait, it doesn't involve
riding horses, does it?

23:08.586 --> 23:10.955
No, no, not until
you sign off.

23:10.955 --> 23:12.924
But we're going to be
feeding horses.

23:12.924 --> 23:14.892
We're going to be
mucking their stalls.

23:14.892 --> 23:16.594
Mucking stalls?

23:16.594 --> 23:18.162
Do you know what
mucking stalls means?

23:18.162 --> 23:20.131
I can muck stalls.

23:20.131 --> 23:22.667
Come on, before it starts
to get light outside.

23:22.667 --> 23:23.802
-See you, Dad.
-Okay.

23:23.802 --> 23:27.172
Yeah, you guys go muck.
I'm gonna go back to sleep.

23:28.172 --> 23:30.115
-Chloe: What does
mucking stalls mean?
-(Sydney laughs)

23:38.115 --> 23:39.586
(knocking on door)

23:41.586 --> 23:43.059
You've gotta be kidding me.

23:49.059 --> 23:50.129
What did you forget?

23:52.129 --> 23:53.564
Good morning, sunshine.

23:53.564 --> 23:56.133
I would hardly
call this morning.

23:56.133 --> 23:57.171
Hmm.

24:00.171 --> 24:01.639
What is it
with this place?

24:01.639 --> 24:05.243
My daughter, who freaks
out when I ask her to
clean her room at home

24:05.243 --> 24:09.881
just happily marched
down to the door
to go muck stalls.

24:09.881 --> 24:12.049
Well, the farm does have
that effect on people.

24:12.049 --> 24:13.651
Thank you.

24:13.651 --> 24:15.887
Listen, I'm sorry
about yesterday.

24:15.887 --> 24:17.054
Oh, really?

24:17.054 --> 24:19.089
I know you're
trying to help,

24:19.089 --> 24:20.825
even though you
don't know anything.

24:20.825 --> 24:22.027
(laughs) Nice apology.

24:23.027 --> 24:25.796
No, I meant,
you don't know
anything about horses.

24:25.796 --> 24:27.833
I'm sure you're
a wonderful accountant.

24:28.833 --> 24:32.103
But I really wish you knew
how much this place meant
to us.

24:32.103 --> 24:34.238
Yeah, Nikki gave me
a pretty good idea.

24:34.238 --> 24:37.842
No, no, no, we're not
just a riding school.

24:37.842 --> 24:43.015
Right, you board,
train, and breed, as well.
Cliff told me.

24:44.015 --> 24:48.087
Yes, but did my dad
tell you how much these
horses mean to us?

24:50.087 --> 24:52.723
Like... they're family.

24:52.723 --> 24:55.193
And if we lose this farm,
we're going to be separated.

24:56.193 --> 24:57.795
So...

24:57.795 --> 24:59.865
my dad is right.

25:00.865 --> 25:02.833
We're going to need
your help.

25:02.833 --> 25:06.203
I promise that I am going
to try everything

25:06.203 --> 25:08.640
to get this done for you.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.077
Don't try. Do.

25:13.077 --> 25:14.746
Got it.

25:15.746 --> 25:16.013
As a peace offering,

25:17.013 --> 25:21.819
I have brought you
my legendary eggnog muffins,

25:21.819 --> 25:23.154
fresh from the oven.

25:23.154 --> 25:24.021
-Legendary, huh?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:25.021 --> 25:26.958
Come on, you cook, too?

25:26.958 --> 25:28.030
Well, I'm full
of surprises.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.165
These are amazing.

25:34.165 --> 25:35.000
I know. Thanks.
They're my mom's recipe.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.869
No, no, no. Seriously,
you need to give up
the horse business

25:38.869 --> 25:41.108
and sell these, because
you'll make a fortune.

25:44.108 --> 25:45.376
Sorry, that's--

25:45.376 --> 25:48.114
I'm just kidding.
I'm just saying,
these are crazy good.

25:50.114 --> 25:52.150
Have you ever been
on a horse, Michael?

25:53.150 --> 25:56.287
I was in a buggy
in Central Park once.
Does that count?

25:56.287 --> 25:59.290
No. I mean, have you
been on a horse?

25:59.290 --> 26:02.027
Because I think you'll have
a real understanding of how
much this place means to us

26:03.027 --> 26:05.963
if you could just get
your butt up on one and
you took a ride with me.

26:05.963 --> 26:08.167
No, thanks. I'm good
right here on old terra firma.

26:10.167 --> 26:12.036
Okay, well,
I'm not asking.

26:12.036 --> 26:14.171
Okay? So...

26:14.171 --> 26:16.641
I suggest you find
yourself some warm
clothes,

26:16.641 --> 26:20.745
some jeans, if you got 'em.
Maybe lose those snowman
pajama bottoms.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.246
What's wrong with
my pajama bottoms?

26:22.246 --> 26:24.818
Yeah, I'll see you
in the barn in an hour.

26:27.818 --> 26:29.088
This place is insane.

26:31.088 --> 26:32.891
Oh, my God,
these are good.

26:33.891 --> 26:35.960
Ugh, it stinks in here.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.862
(chuckles)
You get used to it.

26:37.862 --> 26:39.265
I don't think so.

26:41.265 --> 26:43.167
So where do you
go to school?

26:43.167 --> 26:45.871
You're looking at it.
I'm homeschooled.

26:46.871 --> 26:49.807
So, you don't get
to hang out with
kids your own age?

26:49.807 --> 26:51.342
Well, sure I do.
Kids are here all the time

26:51.342 --> 26:54.211
for riding lessons and...
I used to compete as well.

26:54.211 --> 26:56.814
Compete in what?
Mucking stalls?

26:56.814 --> 27:00.217
Ha-ha! I used to compete
in jumping and riding.

27:00.217 --> 27:02.720
You know, my mom used to
compete, too, and Aunt Sam.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.422
You know,
they were good.

27:04.422 --> 27:07.191
Why don't you guys
compete anymore?

27:07.191 --> 27:09.126
Running the farm
takes a lot of time.

27:09.126 --> 27:12.363
My mom and Aunt Sam
usually take turns helping
my dad out with the horses,

27:12.363 --> 27:15.332
or sitting in an office
yelling at each other.

27:15.332 --> 27:16.934
What does your
grandpa do?

27:16.934 --> 27:18.904
Not much
since he hurt his leg.

27:19.904 --> 27:21.174
What happened
to your grandma?

27:23.174 --> 27:24.309
She got sick.

27:24.309 --> 27:27.378
Now, she was tough.
Even tougher than
Aunt Sam.

27:27.378 --> 27:29.313
We thought she'd
beat it, but...

27:29.313 --> 27:32.083
-That's got to be hard.
-Yeah.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.384
But tougher than Sam?

27:33.384 --> 27:35.334
I don't think
that's possible.

27:50.334 --> 27:52.103
You ready?

27:52.103 --> 27:53.843
Ready as I'm gonna be.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.046
-Ho!
-Wow!

28:02.046 --> 28:03.681
You clean up nice.

28:03.681 --> 28:06.884
Oh, well, thank you.
You're just saying that 'cause
you want more of my muffins.

28:06.884 --> 28:08.486
I'm not gonna
touch that one.

28:08.486 --> 28:12.289
This is Miss Sally Jane,
and she will be your horse.

28:12.289 --> 28:14.227
We're going to take a ride
around the farm, so you can
see why it's so special.

28:16.227 --> 28:18.129
Why do I get
the little horse?

28:18.129 --> 28:20.331
Let's go, city boy.
Come on.

28:20.331 --> 28:21.502
Come on.

28:24.502 --> 28:26.337
Want a helmet?

28:26.337 --> 28:27.206
No, I don't
need a helmet.

28:29.206 --> 28:30.341
Sam: All right,
come over here.

28:30.341 --> 28:32.309
You're not supposed to walk
behind the horse, right?

28:32.309 --> 28:34.945
-No.
-'Cause they'll kick you?

28:34.945 --> 28:36.947
It's possible.
Not her though.
She's harmless.

28:36.947 --> 28:38.349
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

28:38.349 --> 28:40.186
So I'm going to put
the reins over her head...

28:42.186 --> 28:45.122
and what you're
going to do is...

28:45.122 --> 28:47.057
-And grab a little
bit of mane...
-Mmm-hmm.

28:47.057 --> 28:48.325
All with your left hand.

28:48.325 --> 28:49.527
-Okay?
-Yeah.

28:49.527 --> 28:51.495
Stick your left foot
in this stirrup.

28:51.495 --> 28:53.531
Try to put it on
the palm of your
foot. Okay?

28:53.531 --> 28:55.466
And swing your
right foot over.

28:55.466 --> 28:56.367
Really?

28:56.367 --> 28:58.002
Yeah. You up for it?

28:59.002 --> 29:00.505
-All right.
-Super easy.

29:01.505 --> 29:03.374
Okay, left hand...

29:03.374 --> 29:05.276
-on the mane...
-Okay, it's a little loose.

29:05.276 --> 29:07.512
Put your right hand
on the horn and swing
your leg over.

29:08.512 --> 29:10.183
Oh, goodness.

29:12.183 --> 29:13.387
Yeah.

29:16.387 --> 29:17.454
Good job.

29:17.454 --> 29:19.390
You okay?

29:19.390 --> 29:20.958
I got this.

29:20.958 --> 29:22.395
Okay, let's go.

29:24.395 --> 29:25.030
Charge. (chuckles)

29:26.030 --> 29:27.364
(Sam laughing)

29:27.364 --> 29:28.465
So this is what you do.

29:28.465 --> 29:31.068
When you're
ready to go... Okay?

29:31.068 --> 29:32.570
You just give her
a little bit of a nudge

29:32.570 --> 29:35.339
with your leg,
and say "Walk on."

29:35.339 --> 29:37.408
And use your reins
to direct her,

29:37.408 --> 29:39.243
right or left or straight.

29:39.243 --> 29:41.413
That's it. That's
all I have to do
to make her go?

29:42.413 --> 29:45.951
-Walk on.
-Sam: Come on.

29:46.951 --> 29:47.019
Sam: That's great.

29:48.019 --> 29:50.088
-What am I...?
-Okay, steer left.
Steer, yeah.

29:52.088 --> 29:54.391
-Direct her where
you want to go.
-Okay.

29:54.391 --> 29:57.394
She's harmless.
You're good. You're good.
Don't wiggle so much.

29:57.394 --> 29:59.897
-That's the way.
-I got this.

29:59.897 --> 30:02.933
Ride on, Cyclone.

30:02.933 --> 30:04.335
T-Biscuit...

30:04.335 --> 30:05.603
(laughing)
T-Biscuit...

30:05.603 --> 30:07.326
This maybe isn't
such a good idea.

30:29.326 --> 30:30.403
Is this heaven or what?

30:39.403 --> 30:41.543
-Come on.
-Incredible.

30:46.543 --> 30:48.446
Sam:
This is the spot, right...

30:49.446 --> 30:51.483
-Right here.
-Right here.

30:52.483 --> 30:54.220
That is spectacular.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.155
I mean,
it's beautiful.

30:58.155 --> 30:59.023
We're not in
the city anymore.

31:00.023 --> 31:03.428
This is my absolute
favorite place on the farm.

31:04.428 --> 31:07.564
My mom and I used to come here
and watch the sunrise together.

31:07.564 --> 31:09.934
Cliff told me
about your mom.

31:09.934 --> 31:12.436
I'm so sorry
about your loss.

31:12.436 --> 31:13.571
Thank you.

31:14.571 --> 31:15.839
(sighs) Yeah.

31:15.839 --> 31:18.642
Did Daddy tell you
that she did everything,
including the books?

31:18.642 --> 31:20.611
(chuckles) Not very well.

31:20.611 --> 31:22.080
Oh, well, I guess
I'm gonna find out.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.517
Yeah, he told me that
she handled everything.

31:26.517 --> 31:29.355
Yeah, she did.
Her only weakness was
her younger brother Buddy.

31:31.355 --> 31:33.223
You know,
he was one of those,

31:33.223 --> 31:35.627
get rich quick
scheme artists.

31:36.627 --> 31:38.262
And, uh,

31:38.262 --> 31:40.230
I don't know,
he just would always tell her,

31:40.230 --> 31:43.367
"One day we'll be rich
and you'll never have
to work again."

31:43.367 --> 31:44.535
She used to fall for it?

31:44.535 --> 31:47.237
No, not at all.
She never

31:47.237 --> 31:49.740
thought that being
on the farm was work,
so, she loved it.

31:49.740 --> 31:52.309
-I could see that.
-Yeah.

31:52.309 --> 31:54.044
Once your butt
gets used to it.

31:54.044 --> 31:56.647
(chuckling)

31:56.647 --> 31:58.048
Where's Uncle Buddy now?

31:58.048 --> 32:01.552
Is he Donald Trump
or a Bill Gates type of guy?

32:01.552 --> 32:05.222
Because we could really
work with that about now.

32:05.222 --> 32:07.725
No, he passed away
when Syd and I were kids.

32:07.725 --> 32:09.427
Oh.

32:10.427 --> 32:11.029
Cliff was telling me,

32:12.029 --> 32:15.468
some of the horses are worth
quite a bit of money.

32:17.468 --> 32:18.503
Mmm-hmm.

32:18.503 --> 32:22.773
Well, I know you said
they're like family, but...

32:22.773 --> 32:25.211
I mean, why couldn't you
just sell one of 'em?

32:27.211 --> 32:28.545
Well...

32:28.545 --> 32:31.682
Some of the
higher-priced animals...

32:31.682 --> 32:35.020
Well, they're just boarding.
They're not ours, and the four
that we do own,

32:36.020 --> 32:37.654
well, they are family.

32:37.654 --> 32:39.524
What about the one that
Chloe was on yesterday?

32:40.524 --> 32:41.026
Holly, yeah.

32:42.026 --> 32:43.694
Holly was my
mother's favorite.

32:43.694 --> 32:45.396
Ah, of course.

32:45.396 --> 32:48.165
And...

32:48.165 --> 32:51.635
I think it would just
kill Daddy to get rid of her.

32:51.635 --> 32:53.303
And me.

32:53.303 --> 32:55.105
Well, what you have to
understand is you're not going

32:55.105 --> 32:57.243
to have any horses
if we don't save the farm.

32:59.243 --> 33:00.811
We're not going
to lose the farm.

33:00.811 --> 33:03.079
I promised my daddy.

33:03.079 --> 33:05.550
Well, we better get back
and I better get
into the books.

33:06.550 --> 33:08.553
Thank you.
Let's do it.

33:09.553 --> 33:12.656
After I take a nice,
long, hot bath.

33:12.656 --> 33:14.558
Take care of the bruises.

33:14.558 --> 33:16.326
-Are you going to help me up?
-I'm trying to.

33:16.326 --> 33:18.298
-I'm so sore.
-Oh, thank you.

33:21.298 --> 33:23.200
Come here, Hollyberries.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.602
Come here, girl!

33:25.602 --> 33:27.738
Why do you call
her Hollyberries?

33:27.738 --> 33:29.740
Holly was born
on Christmas Eve,

33:29.740 --> 33:32.609
and Grandma loved
holly bushes.

33:32.609 --> 33:34.178
Oh, so her birthday
is coming up?

33:34.178 --> 33:36.480
Here. Maybe she's hungry.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.715
Mmm.
Yummy, yummy.

33:38.715 --> 33:40.252
Maybe she just
really likes you.

33:42.252 --> 33:44.254
Do you think
we can take a ride?

33:44.254 --> 33:46.123
Oh, I don't know.

33:46.123 --> 33:48.297
Come on, I thought
you were a horseman,
not a chicken.

33:53.297 --> 33:54.731
Whoa!

33:54.731 --> 33:56.600
Come on, Chloe,
I want to show you
something really cool.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.573
Let's go tie up
the horses.

34:02.573 --> 34:05.275
This is where my
grandparents used
to live.

34:05.275 --> 34:07.611
It must be really old.

34:07.611 --> 34:09.313
Yup.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.482
This was my grandma's
quiet place.

34:11.482 --> 34:13.152
She's to come here
to read or sew.

34:15.152 --> 34:16.820
So I guess nobody
comes here anymore?

34:16.820 --> 34:19.422
Nah. It burnt down.

34:19.422 --> 34:21.859
It didn't have running
water or cable.

34:21.859 --> 34:24.161
You know, like how all of us
country folk live, huh.

34:24.161 --> 34:26.364
Oh, ha-ha.
So, I was wrong.

34:28.364 --> 34:30.266
You want to check it out?

34:30.266 --> 34:32.737
-Yeah, sure.
-All right.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.806
Hey, watch out
for snakes.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.774
-What? (yelps)
-(hisses)

34:37.774 --> 34:39.280
Now who's the chicken?

34:43.280 --> 34:45.382
Wow, what a bunch of junk.

34:46.382 --> 34:49.424
Yeah. I used to come
up here all the time
when I was little.

34:54.424 --> 34:56.827
How long has it been
since you've been here?

34:56.827 --> 34:58.695
A long time.

34:58.695 --> 35:00.297
Well, we better
get going.

35:00.297 --> 35:02.366
-Okay.
-We gotta get back.

35:02.366 --> 35:04.370
-We can come back.
-Yeah, come on.

35:06.370 --> 35:07.938
(laughs) You mean to tell me,

35:07.938 --> 35:10.309
that you guys don't have
any accounting software?

35:12.309 --> 35:15.746
How did you guys do
receipts and payroll?

35:15.746 --> 35:18.549
I don't know,
my mom did it all.

35:18.549 --> 35:22.419
All right. Do you at least
know where the books
are from last year?

35:22.419 --> 35:24.788
-Well, actually, I do.
-Good.

35:24.788 --> 35:27.725
I gave you everything.
It should be here.

35:28.725 --> 35:30.862
Just...

35:31.862 --> 35:34.667
Oh, here, yeah.
Right there.

35:36.667 --> 35:38.669
You can't be serious.

35:38.669 --> 35:40.204
You can't be serious.

35:40.204 --> 35:42.441
-No, it's all here.
-Okay.

35:44.441 --> 35:47.878
I think I have about
all that I can handle
for the moment.

35:47.878 --> 35:51.848
So don't you have some
stalls to muck or horses
to ride or something?

35:51.848 --> 35:54.451
-I can take a hint.
-Good.

35:54.451 --> 35:57.287
You know, I can
just leave you to it.

35:57.287 --> 35:58.956
It's just...

35:58.956 --> 36:00.226
Got it.

36:02.226 --> 36:03.728
(sighs)

36:04.728 --> 36:05.765
(neighing)

36:08.765 --> 36:10.200
I can still hear you.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.870
Do you think that
I'm incapable of doing this
without your supervision?

36:13.870 --> 36:14.905
Is that it?

36:14.905 --> 36:15.245
(nickering)

36:21.245 --> 36:22.781
My new assistant.

36:24.781 --> 36:27.686
Oh, Daddy, can you take that?
Here, Daddy, thank you.

36:29.686 --> 36:31.421
Are you okay,
Aunt Sam?

36:31.421 --> 36:32.689
Yeah, why?

36:32.689 --> 36:35.559
-You smell nice, and
you're wearing earrings.
-Thank you.

36:35.559 --> 36:36.460
Do you like 'em?

36:36.460 --> 36:39.329
Yeah, but you have
lipstick on your teeth.

36:39.329 --> 36:41.966
Wow, something
sure smells good.

36:42.966 --> 36:44.768
-Hey! Here you go.
-Cliff: Hey!

36:44.768 --> 36:45.836
What have
we got over here?

36:45.836 --> 36:49.573
Oh! We have meatloaf
in the oven,

36:49.573 --> 36:51.475
and black-eyed peas,

36:51.475 --> 36:52.876
and green beans
and yams.

36:52.876 --> 36:54.912
Wow, that's really amazing.

36:55.912 --> 36:57.848
Why are you covering
your mouth with your hand?

36:57.848 --> 36:59.250
Oh, I burnt my tongue.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.752
Cliff: Hey, Michael,
how's that guest house
working out for you, buddy?

37:01.752 --> 37:04.755
-Oh, great.
-Cliff: That's good.

37:04.755 --> 37:06.723
Michael: It's perfect.

37:06.723 --> 37:09.693
Chloe: Daddy here fell asleep
in his bathtub last night.

37:09.693 --> 37:11.928
You know what, Chloe,
I asked you not to out me

37:11.928 --> 37:13.865
and it's the first thing
you do when I get here.

37:14.865 --> 37:16.500
-Oh, wow!
-First time on a horse?

37:16.500 --> 37:17.902
Oh, yeah.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.003
You're just going to
have to get over that
when you're out here.

37:20.003 --> 37:22.806
-Really?
-Really. Yeah.

37:22.806 --> 37:24.841
Hey, when was this?

37:24.841 --> 37:27.978
Oh, that's a holiday horse show
we had here a few years back.

37:27.978 --> 37:30.480
We had clients
and breeders,

37:30.480 --> 37:33.850
riders from all over
the state come here
for competition.

37:33.850 --> 37:36.753
We even held a black-tie
formal affair here.

37:36.753 --> 37:38.455
Like, with evening gowns?

37:38.455 --> 37:39.956
Sydney: Used to be
a pretty big affair.

37:39.956 --> 37:41.025
Chloe, if you go over
to that bookshelf
right there,

37:42.025 --> 37:45.529
there are some old photo
albums and scrapbooks

37:45.529 --> 37:46.932
that you might like.

37:48.932 --> 37:50.901
So have you had a chance
to look over our books yet?

37:50.901 --> 37:53.870
I'm going to have
a perfect assessment
tomorrow.

37:53.870 --> 37:56.072
I hope so.
You know, John Parker's
our biggest client,

37:56.072 --> 37:58.675
and he's out of this deal now.
I don't know what
we're going to do.

37:58.675 --> 38:00.944
Daddy, Daddy,
don't say that.

38:00.944 --> 38:02.746
Mr. Harrison,
we got this.

38:02.746 --> 38:06.950
Okay? But I'm going to need
to talk to you and your sister
tomorrow regarding the books.

38:06.950 --> 38:09.052
-Yeah.
-Cliff: I hope you can
come up with something.

38:09.052 --> 38:12.356
We've got the vultures
at the bank, gonna be here
tomorrow with another notice.

38:12.356 --> 38:15.559
Don't worry about those
guys from the bank
because I got a plan.

38:15.559 --> 38:16.893
I'm gonna buy us
some more time.

38:16.893 --> 38:18.729
Okay, no more work talk.

38:18.729 --> 38:20.897
-This...
-Look at that. Oh, yum!

38:20.897 --> 38:22.599
-Yum!
-Yes!

38:22.599 --> 38:24.101
-Oh, I almost forgot.
-Cliff: Thank you, honey.

38:24.101 --> 38:26.570
Okay, I think
that's everything.

38:26.570 --> 38:27.838
Shall we?

38:27.838 --> 38:29.506
-All right.
-Don't hurt yourself.

38:29.506 --> 38:30.941
Yeah. Yeah.

38:30.941 --> 38:32.844
Pass those around.

38:33.844 --> 38:34.945
Whoo!

38:34.945 --> 38:36.519
Good job.

38:42.519 --> 38:43.020
-Sam: You okay, Dad?
-Yeah.

38:44.020 --> 38:46.623
Sam, I gotta tell you,
that dinner was incredible.

38:46.623 --> 38:48.025
Yeah, it was really
great. Thank you.

38:49.025 --> 38:50.427
Oh, yeah!

38:50.427 --> 38:51.995
Of course.
My pleasure.

38:51.995 --> 38:54.965
Michael, Chloe was wondering
if maybe you'd sign a waiver,

38:54.965 --> 38:57.868
so that she could take some
beginner riding lessons.

38:57.868 --> 39:01.139
Well, honestly,
I was on a horse today
and it wasn't so bad.

39:02.139 --> 39:05.041
I shall sign the waiver
for Chloe to ride...

39:05.041 --> 39:07.978
-Thank you!
-...but you have to promise
me to be so careful. Okay?

39:07.978 --> 39:09.679
I promise. I promise.

39:09.679 --> 39:13.083
So, do you want
to go for a ride
with me tomorrow,

39:13.083 --> 39:14.518
while your dad
is working?

39:14.518 --> 39:16.820
Yeah, that'd be great.

39:16.820 --> 39:19.054
All right. I just hope
you're a better rider
than your dad is.

39:19.054 --> 39:20.624
Oh, okay.

39:20.624 --> 39:22.459
On that note,
we'll say good night.

39:22.459 --> 39:24.094
-Good night.
-Thank you.

39:24.094 --> 39:26.830
-Good night.
-Good night, you two.

39:26.830 --> 39:28.063
Good night.

39:28.063 --> 39:30.167
Poor guy.
I feel for him.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.102
You know,
having to raise
Chloe on his own.

39:32.102 --> 39:33.937
-Yeah.
-That can't be easy.

39:33.937 --> 39:35.872
What happened
to his wife?

39:35.872 --> 39:38.910
She was killed
in a car accident
last spring.

39:39.910 --> 39:42.846
Yeah. You never know
what, uh,

39:42.846 --> 39:45.451
someone else might
be carrying in their
saddle, you know?

39:47.451 --> 39:48.056
Let's go.

39:54.056 --> 39:55.108
(sighs)

40:45.108 --> 40:46.276
-Sam: Got it?
-Yup.

40:46.276 --> 40:47.011
Good job.

40:48.011 --> 40:50.180
You know, Chloe...

40:50.180 --> 40:52.916
I know we don't know
each other that well...

40:52.916 --> 40:55.786
but I know what it's like
to lose somebody that you love.

40:56.786 --> 40:59.155
And if you ever wanna talk,

40:59.155 --> 41:00.225
I'm here.

41:02.225 --> 41:03.728
Thanks, Sam.

41:04.728 --> 41:06.096
No problem.

41:06.096 --> 41:07.531
Now, shall we?

41:07.531 --> 41:09.005
-Yeah.
-Come on.

41:16.005 --> 41:18.808
Sydney, I don't...
We still don't have April.

41:18.808 --> 41:20.011
-I can't find it.
-Uh... Uh... Uh.

41:21.011 --> 41:23.780
-Um, April...
-See.

41:23.780 --> 41:25.949
-Where? This is not April.
-April!

41:25.949 --> 41:27.153
Aha! April.

41:30.153 --> 41:34.190
You keep April on a roll
of paper towels?

41:34.190 --> 41:36.226
We ran out of paper.

41:36.226 --> 41:39.296
And I think I might've
logged some smaller checks

41:39.296 --> 41:41.231
on a fence post outside.

41:41.231 --> 41:42.332
I'm joking!

41:42.332 --> 41:44.834
Oh... (laughs)
That's so funny!

41:44.834 --> 41:48.038
What's not funny
is that you keep records
on paper towels.

41:48.038 --> 41:49.172
It's pretty funny.

41:49.172 --> 41:51.207
(sighs)

41:51.207 --> 41:54.146
All right,
I need to ask you about...

41:56.146 --> 41:59.849
This is a letter addressed
to your mother regarding some
old airline stock options.

41:59.849 --> 42:01.251
What do you
know about that?

42:01.251 --> 42:04.220
Who knows? This is probably
some Uncle Buddy scheme.

42:04.220 --> 42:05.755
Did Sam ever
tell you about him?

42:05.755 --> 42:08.792
Yeah, she told me
all about good old
Uncle Buddy.

42:08.792 --> 42:11.127
I know that he tried
to sell Mom some
stock options

42:11.127 --> 42:13.330
on a little airline
that he used to work on.

42:13.330 --> 42:14.298
Maybe she bought some.

42:14.298 --> 42:15.699
Don't you think it's worth
giving them a call?

42:15.699 --> 42:19.803
I seriously doubt it.
Nothing Uncle Buddy ever
touched turned to gold.

42:19.803 --> 42:21.607
I'm gonna give them a call.

42:23.607 --> 42:25.275
What time does
the bank get here?

42:25.275 --> 42:26.910
2:00 p.m.

42:26.910 --> 42:30.714
Okay. What I'm going to do
is, I'm going to put together
a profit and loss statement

42:30.714 --> 42:32.115
and I'm going to try
and convince them

42:32.115 --> 42:34.083
that you're going to be
able to pay off some of
the debt

42:34.083 --> 42:36.085
after you get
your tax return.

42:36.085 --> 42:37.954
Do you really think
that'll work?

42:37.954 --> 42:39.256
They're sensible guys.

42:40.256 --> 42:41.663
It should work.

42:46.663 --> 42:48.365
Wow, she really likes you.

42:48.365 --> 42:50.834
Yeah, I think
she just wants
another apple.

42:50.834 --> 42:52.370
Nah, she likes you.

42:53.370 --> 42:55.338
I think she wants
her nails done.

42:55.338 --> 42:56.973
Hey, you want to paint
her hooves?

42:56.973 --> 42:58.908
-Really?
-Yeah.

42:58.908 --> 43:01.980
Horses get their hooves done,
just like you get your nails
done.

43:03.980 --> 43:07.283
Hear that, Holly?
You're gonna
get a mani-pedi.

43:07.283 --> 43:09.020
You know, with all
this manual work,

43:10.020 --> 43:12.422
I really think
that I could use
a mani-pedi, too.

43:12.422 --> 43:14.224
My nails look awful.

43:14.224 --> 43:16.233
Well, welcome to
the country, cowgirl.

43:23.233 --> 43:25.068
Hey.

43:25.068 --> 43:27.437
So, Sydney told me
you have a plan.

43:27.437 --> 43:30.240
Michael's gonna see
if they'll give us an
extension till tax time.

43:30.240 --> 43:33.343
Yeah. It's fairly
straightforward,
simple.

43:33.343 --> 43:36.413
I don't see any reason
why they should turn it down.

43:36.413 --> 43:38.848
I have Sydney's
signature and...

43:38.848 --> 43:39.983
if you approve.

43:39.983 --> 43:43.824
(sighs) All right, well.
Let's hope these guys go for it.

43:47.824 --> 43:48.863
(knock on door)

43:53.863 --> 43:55.063
-Bill.
-Yes.

43:55.063 --> 43:57.200
-Hey, how are you?
Come on in.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

43:57.200 --> 44:00.103
I'm Michael Thompson,
CPA, and...

44:00.103 --> 44:03.339
Let's just go out to my office,
maybe we could work
something out, huh?

44:03.339 --> 44:05.486
-Let's talk.
-All right.

44:16.486 --> 44:18.121
She's gorgeous.

44:18.121 --> 44:20.323
Mmm-hmm.
That's Holly.

44:20.323 --> 44:22.058
She's worth
a pretty penny.

44:22.058 --> 44:24.294
Holly?

44:24.294 --> 44:26.896
She's the one those
folks in Kentucky are
interested in, right?

44:26.896 --> 44:30.133
-Yes, sir.
-She'd make a nice
Christmas gift.

44:30.133 --> 44:33.303
Why do you think
we're ahead of schedule?

44:33.303 --> 44:35.839
I think it's about time
we collect our first asset.

44:35.839 --> 44:37.484
Her.

44:47.484 --> 44:48.952
Did you hear that?

44:48.952 --> 44:50.354
Let's go.

44:51.354 --> 44:52.522
Grandpa! Grandpa!

44:52.522 --> 44:54.157
-What's up, Jack?
-What? What?

44:54.157 --> 44:56.993
It's those sleazy bankers.
We heard them saying,
they were going to take Holly.

44:56.993 --> 44:58.228
-You won't let them, will you?
-Whoa!

44:58.228 --> 45:00.797
Just hold on. What exactly
did you hear them say?

45:00.797 --> 45:03.800
Just something about
Holly being a good
asset to take.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.001
Well, you know,
this is not the first time

45:06.001 --> 45:08.204
there's been a hefty offer
on the table for that horse.

45:08.204 --> 45:11.207
Yeah, but they can't just
take her, right? I mean,
she belongs to you.

45:11.207 --> 45:12.475
Yeah, Mom,
Holly is ours.

45:12.475 --> 45:16.112
Yes! Holly is ours!
And no, we're not gonna
let them take her.

45:16.112 --> 45:17.380
But how can you
be so sure?

45:17.380 --> 45:19.949
Your dad is trying to make
sure of that right now.

45:19.949 --> 45:23.186
So let's just wait
and see what happens.
Okay?

45:23.186 --> 45:25.295
-It's okay.
-Settle guys, all right.

45:32.295 --> 45:33.530
How did it go?

45:33.530 --> 45:36.399
Please tell me
they went for it.

45:36.399 --> 45:38.835
-(sighs) Wish I could.
-What happened?

45:38.835 --> 45:41.271
First of all,
let me tell you,
those two bankers...

45:41.271 --> 45:43.473
Not my favorite
people in the world.

45:43.473 --> 45:45.441
Not only are they not
going to give us more time,

45:45.441 --> 45:47.410
they want collateral now.

45:47.410 --> 45:49.412
They're talking
about next week.

45:49.412 --> 45:51.581
We know you did all you could,
Michael, we appreciate it.

45:51.581 --> 45:54.517
They didn't go for it
because of Holly,
because they want her.

45:54.517 --> 45:56.319
She's the down payment,
isn't she?

45:56.319 --> 45:58.021
Did they mention Holly,
when you met with them?

45:59.021 --> 46:03.393
They did suggest
a horse as a possible
first installment. Yeah.

46:03.393 --> 46:05.395
See, Chloe's right.

46:05.395 --> 46:08.298
Yeah, but they can't
just take her, right?

46:08.298 --> 46:10.967
We owe them $200,000.
They can take whatever
they want.

46:10.967 --> 46:13.436
Look, just hear me out
for a second.

46:13.436 --> 46:16.105
If you sold the horse,
couldn't you just buy
it back?

46:16.105 --> 46:20.243
No. Okay?
Horses are not like cars.

46:20.243 --> 46:22.879
And besides, we take Holly
over to those Kentucky folks,
they're gonna meet her,

46:22.879 --> 46:25.515
they're gonna fall in love
with her, and they're never
going to want to give her back.

46:25.515 --> 46:27.483
If it meant buying
us more time,

46:27.483 --> 46:30.119
I mean, would the farm
in Kentucky be so bad?

46:30.119 --> 46:33.423
You know, he's right.
They would take really
good care of her.

46:33.423 --> 46:35.090
Sydney, Holly's family.

46:35.090 --> 46:37.894
And sometimes family
needs to make sacrifices.

46:37.894 --> 46:39.262
Then can we sacrifice King?

46:39.262 --> 46:40.563
Don't even talk
about King.

46:40.563 --> 46:41.798
Okay, girls,
that's enough.

46:41.798 --> 46:45.468
The big questions is,
have we considered
every option?

46:45.468 --> 46:47.904
Are we overlooking
anything?

46:47.904 --> 46:50.273
Well, have you gone through
all the books?

46:50.273 --> 46:53.910
I guarantee you,
there's no help waiting
for us in any of the books.

46:53.910 --> 46:56.880
What about that
black-tie ball that you guys
used to throw years ago?

46:56.880 --> 46:59.415
Why don't we throw one this year
and make it a fund-raiser?

46:59.415 --> 47:00.817
Chloe, that ball
that we threw

47:00.817 --> 47:03.386
was to give something
back to the community
and for our friends.

47:03.386 --> 47:05.455
It just wouldn't be right
to charge them now.

47:05.455 --> 47:06.023
Hold on a second.

47:07.023 --> 47:09.125
I mean,
with all due respect,

47:09.125 --> 47:10.894
Mr. Harrison, uh...

47:10.894 --> 47:13.463
Your generosity has been
part of the problem here.

47:13.463 --> 47:17.133
I mean, you've allowed horses
to board for free when people
couldn't pay.

47:17.133 --> 47:21.304
You've allowed families
to go on payment plans
they really couldn't afford.

47:21.304 --> 47:25.308
Riding lessons for their kids,
I mean, when you think about it,
you've helped a lot of people.

47:25.308 --> 47:28.645
I don't think there's anything
wrong with allowing them
to give back to you.

47:28.645 --> 47:30.513
It's not a bad idea, Dad.

47:30.513 --> 47:32.448
It could work.

47:32.448 --> 47:33.983
You know, I like it.

47:33.983 --> 47:35.285
Me, too.

47:35.285 --> 47:36.320
(chuckles)

47:36.320 --> 47:38.454
Okay, how do you think
we're going to do all this?

47:38.454 --> 47:41.691
I mean, there's less than
three weeks before Christmas.

47:41.691 --> 47:43.993
We don't have any
invitations out.

47:43.993 --> 47:46.629
And what makes you think
anybody's going to show up
for this thing anyway?

47:46.629 --> 47:50.266
They'll remember how amazing
it was all those years ago.

47:50.266 --> 47:53.469
And they'll want to come back
and relive the moment, right?

47:53.469 --> 47:56.506
Look, I know what
you guys used to charge
for these tickets.

47:56.506 --> 47:59.976
I mean, you stand to
make a hefty sum here.

47:59.976 --> 48:04.079
$250 a head. Let's say...

48:04.079 --> 48:06.382
You know, talking
about 800 people.

48:06.382 --> 48:10.453
I don't know if we've
got room for 800 people
in the big hall.

48:10.453 --> 48:13.556
Well, then we'll charge
$350 per person,

48:13.556 --> 48:16.259
and we'll have
raffle prizes,

48:16.259 --> 48:18.628
and offer free riding lessons
for like, a year.

48:18.628 --> 48:20.630
Yeah, and we'll get
some sponsors

48:20.630 --> 48:23.633
for the food and anything
else we need, really.

48:23.633 --> 48:25.435
What a good idea.

48:25.435 --> 48:27.503
How are we gonna do
all this, huh?

48:27.503 --> 48:30.708
Well, you will do it,
because you have us.

48:31.708 --> 48:32.633
All of us.

48:57.633 --> 49:00.704
Okay, we'll see you then.
Thanks much.

49:01.704 --> 49:03.639
-Another one.
-All right.

49:03.639 --> 49:05.548
-How about that, man?
-(Jack laughs)

49:12.548 --> 49:15.518
Absolutely.
We'll see you then.
Okay. Thanks a lot.

49:15.518 --> 49:16.087
Got another one.

49:18.087 --> 49:19.094
All right.
We're on our way.

49:25.094 --> 49:26.032
All right.

49:29.032 --> 49:30.705
(laughing)

49:35.705 --> 49:38.816
(no audible dialogue)

49:46.816 --> 49:48.719
I'll help you down.

49:49.719 --> 49:51.624
Yes! Yes!

49:54.624 --> 49:58.194
-Hi, Mrs. Parker!
-Hey, Jackson Harrison.

49:58.194 --> 50:02.198
Oh, you tell your family
we're thrilled they're throwing
their ball again this year.

50:02.198 --> 50:03.270
-Yes, ma'am, will do.
-Good to see you.

50:07.270 --> 50:09.472
I can't believe how many
trees you guys have.

50:09.472 --> 50:11.607
Yeah. We have a lot.

50:11.607 --> 50:14.377
Do you think you'd have
an extra that we could
put in the guest house?

50:14.377 --> 50:16.679
Chloe, we don't need
a tree in the guest house.

50:16.679 --> 50:19.115
You guys have
so many in here.

50:19.115 --> 50:20.618
In fact...

50:22.618 --> 50:24.458
Looks like someone
needs some help.

50:28.458 --> 50:30.560
Do you think it's going
to snow this Christmas?

50:30.560 --> 50:32.228
It's been a warm year.

50:32.228 --> 50:34.430
I'd be surprised
if it snows.

50:34.430 --> 50:35.698
That'd take a miracle.

50:35.698 --> 50:39.368
You know, you really
shouldn't be on a ladder
without a spotter.

50:39.368 --> 50:43.239
Oh, well, I used
to jump out of trees
this size,

50:43.239 --> 50:44.574
and bigger.

50:44.574 --> 50:46.509
-That doesn't surprise me.
-(chuckles)

50:46.509 --> 50:49.378
But you missed a spot.

50:49.378 --> 50:51.147
Where?

50:51.147 --> 50:52.715
-What? You can't see?
-No.

50:52.715 --> 50:54.585
Here.

50:55.585 --> 50:58.654
It takes an
expert eye, but...

50:58.654 --> 51:01.657
-Right here.
-You're a show-off.

51:01.657 --> 51:03.426
-I'm a show-off.
-You're a show-off.

51:03.426 --> 51:05.795
-(gasps)
-(chuckles)

51:05.795 --> 51:07.465
Well, who needs
a spotter now?

51:09.465 --> 51:11.834
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

51:11.834 --> 51:13.436
Merry Christmas!

51:13.436 --> 51:15.705
-There he is!
-What?

51:15.705 --> 51:17.840
-Merry Christmas!
-All right!

51:17.840 --> 51:19.909
Jackson: Santa!

51:19.909 --> 51:22.278
-Merry Christmas, y'all.
-Merry Christmas.

51:22.278 --> 51:25.148
(indistinct chattering)

51:25.148 --> 51:26.716
Chloe,
I think this is yours.

51:26.716 --> 51:27.717
I'm gonna guess.

51:27.717 --> 51:29.685
-No, I'm fine.
-Take it, honey.
Merry Christmas.

51:29.685 --> 51:34.624
-Chloe! Open it!
-Wow. You have a really
great kid, Michael.

51:34.624 --> 51:37.827
-And she's so happy here.
-Yeah.

51:37.827 --> 51:41.330
You know, I have
a hard time getting
through to her at home?

51:41.330 --> 51:43.666
Like sometimes I'll...
come home from work early

51:43.666 --> 51:47.303
and she just locks
herself in her room.

51:47.303 --> 51:50.506
I wouldn't worry about it.
That's typical teenage stuff.

51:50.506 --> 51:51.807
I was the exact same way.

51:51.807 --> 51:53.676
Oh, that's reassuring.

51:53.676 --> 51:55.279
Excuse me?

51:56.279 --> 51:57.547
Oh, my gosh!

51:57.547 --> 52:00.249
No, I'm just saying that
it's really good to see
her like this.

52:00.249 --> 52:02.318
-Yeah.
-It feels good.

52:02.318 --> 52:05.821
Yeah, she's really taken
to the horses, especially
Holly.

52:05.821 --> 52:07.890
Yeah, you girls
and your horses.

52:07.890 --> 52:11.694
Yeah, I know,
it's so hard to explain.

52:11.694 --> 52:13.829
I don't know, it's just...

52:13.829 --> 52:15.865
It's so special...

52:15.865 --> 52:18.768
when you can make
that connection
with your horse.

52:18.768 --> 52:21.938
It's like...
It's like flying.

52:21.938 --> 52:23.741
(laughing)

52:25.741 --> 52:28.311
-What? What did I say?
-No... it's just...

52:28.311 --> 52:30.379
It's good to see your
softer side, that's all.

52:30.379 --> 52:32.782
Oh, well, I don't have
a soft side, so...

52:32.782 --> 52:34.617
Oh, yes, you do.

52:34.617 --> 52:36.719
No... No, I don't.

52:36.719 --> 52:38.554
Want to get some
country air?

52:38.554 --> 52:40.289
Yes, I do.

52:40.289 --> 52:41.727
After you, ma'am.

52:44.727 --> 52:47.263
I was talking to Sydney
and she said that

52:47.263 --> 52:49.398
you guys got an offer
on the farm a while back,

52:49.398 --> 52:50.766
something to do
with the neighbor.

52:50.766 --> 52:52.602
Yeah.

52:52.602 --> 52:55.538
And she also told me
that you were the one

52:55.538 --> 52:58.241
who refused
to consider selling.

52:58.241 --> 53:00.910
Yes, we did have
an offer on the farm,

53:00.910 --> 53:03.312
and the gentleman
that wanted to buy it

53:03.312 --> 53:05.681
also wanted a little
housewife to go with, and...

53:05.681 --> 53:09.285
-Ah!
-Yeah, and I don't need anybody
to take care of me, so...

53:09.285 --> 53:13.923
Yeah, well, I think we're...
we're pretty aware of that.

53:13.923 --> 53:15.858
(sighs) Look...

53:15.858 --> 53:18.494
You can't have your
guard up all the time.

53:18.494 --> 53:22.000
Sometimes you have to allow
people that care about you
to help you.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.034
What are you
getting at, Michael?

53:26.034 --> 53:29.405
I want to help you
with the farm.

53:29.405 --> 53:31.574
-Absolutely not.
-Just hear me out.

53:31.574 --> 53:33.476
-No!
-Just, please...

53:33.476 --> 53:36.979
To be honest, my business
back home, it actually does
pretty well.

53:36.979 --> 53:40.883
And I would not be giving
you the money. I would have
a stake here.

53:40.883 --> 53:41.784
-You and I would be--
-Stop.

53:41.784 --> 53:44.620
-We'd be partners.
-I don't want a partner.

53:44.620 --> 53:46.522
This is a family farm.

53:46.522 --> 53:48.527
I don't want you
to have a stake here.

53:51.527 --> 53:53.663
That came out wrong,
I didn't...

53:53.663 --> 53:57.032
(sighs) I'm sorry.
It's just...

53:57.032 --> 53:58.801
It wouldn't be right.

53:58.801 --> 54:01.304
Well, you tell me
what would be right?

54:01.304 --> 54:05.641
For me just
to stand here and watch you
give up everything you love?

54:05.641 --> 54:07.912
Is that right?

54:09.912 --> 54:11.982
I... I don't know.

54:12.982 --> 54:14.817
But I...

54:14.817 --> 54:17.353
This is a lot. I can't.

54:17.353 --> 54:19.588
Sam, wait.

54:19.588 --> 54:21.588
(sighs)

54:19.588 --> 54:21.023
Um...

54:22.023 --> 54:23.895
(sighs) I like you.

54:25.895 --> 54:27.730
I mean...
(stammering)

54:27.730 --> 54:29.032
I really like you.

54:30.032 --> 54:32.902
Wow, I'm bad at this.
(sighing)

54:32.902 --> 54:36.939
I haven't been able to say
anything like this to anyone
since my wife...

54:36.939 --> 54:40.109
And all I'm saying is,
I'd just like to try...

54:40.109 --> 54:41.979
Us.

54:43.979 --> 54:45.014
You can't just stand there

54:46.014 --> 54:48.488
looking beautiful like that
and not say anything.

54:52.488 --> 54:53.890
Um...

54:54.890 --> 54:57.993
With everything that's
going on right now,

54:57.993 --> 54:58.928
I just can't.

54:58.928 --> 55:00.429
You can't what?

55:00.429 --> 55:02.467
Allow yourself
to be happy for once?

55:04.467 --> 55:07.704
Look, Dad, I got
a makeup kit.

55:08.704 --> 55:09.939
Oh, that's nice, honey.

55:09.939 --> 55:12.041
Hey, guys!

55:12.041 --> 55:13.609
Time to light the tree.

55:13.609 --> 55:15.950
Sam:
That's great.

55:20.950 --> 55:21.794
(clears throat)

55:31.794 --> 55:33.629
I got you something.

55:33.629 --> 55:34.497
You did?

55:34.497 --> 55:36.501
Well, it's actually
for the both of you.

55:38.501 --> 55:40.102
I thought we could
give Holly a mani-pedi.

55:40.102 --> 55:41.003
-Seriously?
-Sure.

55:42.003 --> 55:44.840
This is a special paint
that works on hooves.

55:44.840 --> 55:47.410
You know, my Mom has
some in the same color.

55:47.410 --> 55:48.778
You and Holly could match.

55:48.778 --> 55:50.846
Thanks, Jackson.

55:50.846 --> 55:52.148
That was really sweet.

55:52.148 --> 55:54.683
Sure, don't mention it.

55:54.683 --> 55:57.597
Like seriously,
don't mention it
to anyone.

56:08.597 --> 56:09.965
So did we sell
enough tickets?

56:09.965 --> 56:13.836
Looks like we're still
going to be about...

56:13.836 --> 56:17.007
$45,000 short.

56:18.007 --> 56:19.742
Well, it was
a good try, everyone.

56:19.742 --> 56:21.510
It's not over yet,
Sydney.

56:21.510 --> 56:24.113
-(sighs)
-So, wait, what
does this mean?

56:24.113 --> 56:26.482
There's an auction on
the afternoon of the ball.

56:26.482 --> 56:28.551
Some people sell
their horses.

56:28.551 --> 56:30.152
So if we really had to, we--

56:30.152 --> 56:31.754
Not Holly!

56:31.754 --> 56:34.025
Sweetheart, there might
not be another way.

56:36.025 --> 56:39.128
I can't believe you all
would just give up on Holly.

56:39.128 --> 56:40.467
Just like that.

56:44.467 --> 56:46.535
Well, I'm with her.

56:46.535 --> 56:48.003
Getting rid of Holly
is not an option.

56:49.003 --> 56:51.474
Even if we set up
a promissory note
with the bank,

56:51.474 --> 56:55.045
these guys are gonna still want
Holly to make up the difference,
and that's just a fact.

56:56.045 --> 56:57.020
There's got to be another way.

57:05.020 --> 57:06.056
(scoffs)

57:08.056 --> 57:09.525
Come on, Jackson.

57:09.525 --> 57:10.993
You have to help me
get her out of here.

57:10.993 --> 57:12.361
I don't know.

57:12.361 --> 57:14.765
Please. I have to take her
somewhere where they can't
find her.

57:16.765 --> 57:17.658
Fine!

57:42.658 --> 57:44.794
Morning, folks.

57:45.794 --> 57:47.162
You're here to take
one of our horses?

57:47.162 --> 57:50.099
Well, unless you have
the money, yes.

57:50.099 --> 57:52.568
Carl Spencer will be over
later with his trailer.

57:52.568 --> 57:54.537
Well, you'll get your money
after the Christmas ball,

57:54.537 --> 57:57.139
the 26th,
per our agreement.

57:57.139 --> 58:00.276
Well, your first
installment's due today.

58:00.276 --> 58:02.645
(sighs)

58:02.645 --> 58:04.246
Jackson, go get
Holly ready.

58:04.246 --> 58:05.614
I haven't seen her.

58:05.614 --> 58:07.149
What do you mean
you haven't seen her?

58:07.149 --> 58:09.852
Chloe took her for a ride.
I don't know when they'll
be back.

58:09.852 --> 58:12.221
-Sam: What?
-Jackson: She said
they'd be gone for a while.

58:12.221 --> 58:16.292
Wait. What are you saying?
Chloe is on Holly by herself?

58:16.292 --> 58:18.727
Well, she kind of insisted.

58:18.727 --> 58:20.763
Bill: We'll be
back tomorrow.

58:20.763 --> 58:25.768
Make sure you have
your first installment
ready to go.

58:25.768 --> 58:28.938
Jackson, you tell me right now,
did she say where she was going?

58:28.938 --> 58:32.041
She just said she was taking
Holly somewhere that they
wouldn't find her.

58:32.041 --> 58:33.275
Where, Jackson?
Where?

58:33.275 --> 58:35.110
I don't know!

58:35.110 --> 58:38.184
We gotta go. Let's go.
We'll take the horses
and we'll go for a ride.

58:42.184 --> 58:44.989
I know.
I know you're hungry. I know.

58:46.989 --> 58:48.191
All right.

58:49.191 --> 58:50.693
Here's our last apple.

58:50.693 --> 58:53.329
Eat it slowly, so...

58:53.329 --> 58:55.798
That was not slowly.

58:55.798 --> 58:57.268
Do you want to go
to Kentucky?

58:59.268 --> 59:01.737
I just wish I didn't hurt
my arm, so we could mount up

59:01.737 --> 59:03.274
and not be stranded here.

59:05.274 --> 59:08.177
You know, maybe there's
something in the cabin.

59:08.177 --> 59:09.180
I'll be right back.

59:11.180 --> 59:12.682
I got nothing.

59:13.682 --> 59:15.083
Twelve-year-old girl,

59:15.083 --> 59:16.819
just learned how
to ride a horse...

59:16.819 --> 59:18.654
She should've been
back by now.

59:18.654 --> 59:20.155
Where do you think
she went, Sam?

59:20.155 --> 59:22.291
I don't know.
She could be anywhere.

59:22.291 --> 59:24.193
Okay, then I'm not
sitting here anymore.

59:24.193 --> 59:26.695
It's gonna get dark.
Can we go find her, please?

59:26.695 --> 59:28.797
Agreed, and it's about
to get really cold.

59:28.797 --> 59:30.199
Here, I got a map
of the farm.

59:30.199 --> 59:31.434
Oh, great.
Thank you.

59:31.434 --> 59:34.269
Okay, Michael,
you and I will take
the eastern expanse here.

59:34.269 --> 59:36.739
We'll split it in half.
I'll take the woods.

59:36.739 --> 59:40.409
Um, Ben and Sydney,
you go west, cover the fields.

59:40.409 --> 59:42.012
If we haven't heard from her
by then, we'll reconvene here

59:43.012 --> 59:44.780
and then we'll talk about
the north and south, okay?

59:44.780 --> 59:46.315
Wait, what about me?

59:46.315 --> 59:47.916
I want to help
look for her.

59:47.916 --> 59:49.151
Look, it's my fault
she's out there.

59:49.151 --> 59:51.253
-No!
-I should've tried
to stop her.

59:51.253 --> 59:54.890
No, you stay here with Grandpa.
You guys check the stables and
the barn.

59:54.890 --> 59:56.092
Okay.

59:58.092 --> 00:00.092
Okay, please.
Let's go.

59:58.092 --> 00:00.966
All right.

01:00:03.966 --> 01:00:05.001
-Okay. Let's go find
Chloe. Are you ready?
-Yeah.

01:00:06.001 --> 01:00:07.304
Let's go.

01:00:09.304 --> 01:00:10.340
-Chloe!
-Chloe!

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.776
Whoa!

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:15.244
Chloe!

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:16.280
Chloe!

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.723
Chloe!

01:00:27.723 --> 01:00:30.225
Grandpa, I know
where they went.

01:00:30.225 --> 01:00:31.180
Where are you going?

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.450
(thuds)

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:56.406
-Chloe!
-Chloe!

01:01:17.406 --> 01:01:19.241
Chloe! Chloe...

01:01:19.241 --> 01:01:21.477
-Chloe!
-Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:24.045
You all right?
What happened to your arm?

01:01:24.045 --> 01:01:26.081
Uh, I fell off
Holly earlier.

01:01:26.081 --> 01:01:27.449
Is it bad?

01:01:27.449 --> 01:01:29.318
Yeah, it hurts really bad.

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:30.419
And I'm hungry.

01:01:30.419 --> 01:01:31.854
Can we go back,
Jackson?

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.257
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.

01:01:35.257 --> 01:01:38.198
Come on.
You okay?

01:01:43.198 --> 01:01:45.404
Come on. Come on.
Reach right up.

01:01:49.404 --> 01:01:50.939
Whoa!

01:01:50.939 --> 01:01:53.275
Chloe, where have you been?
Do you know how worried
I've been about you?

01:01:53.275 --> 01:01:54.543
Are you okay?

01:01:54.543 --> 01:01:55.744
Chloe fell off Holly.

01:01:55.744 --> 01:01:58.247
She was going to
mount up, but she
sprained her arm.

01:01:58.247 --> 01:01:59.682
Don't you ever do
something like that again.

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:02.284
Do you understand me?
Do you know how worried
I've been about you?

01:02:02.284 --> 01:02:03.819
-Come here.
Are you hurt?
-I'm sorry.

01:02:03.819 --> 01:02:05.054
It hurts.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:07.856
We gotta take her to
the hospital right now.
Let's go.

01:02:07.856 --> 01:02:10.125
Let's go. I was so
worried about you.

01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:11.564
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:02:15.564 --> 01:02:17.534
Okay. Can you lift?

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:21.870
All right.
Nice and warm?

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.406
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:24.406 --> 01:02:26.843
I'm really sorry
I scared everyone today.

01:02:27.843 --> 01:02:29.413
All I care about
is that you're safe.

01:02:31.413 --> 01:02:32.915
I love you.

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.919
I love you, too, Dad.

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.611
-Sleep tight.
-Good night.

01:03:02.611 --> 01:03:03.515
(whispering) Hey!

01:03:06.515 --> 01:03:07.983
How's she doing?

01:03:07.983 --> 01:03:09.419
Just sleeping.

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:13.123
I'm so glad she only has
a sprain and didn't break
anything.

01:03:15.123 --> 01:03:17.125
I mean, she won't be able
to ride for a while, but...

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:18.561
She's not getting
on a horse.

01:03:19.561 --> 01:03:21.931
Not as long as I have
anything to do with it.

01:03:22.931 --> 01:03:24.933
No way.

01:03:24.933 --> 01:03:27.034
You're kidding, right?

01:03:27.034 --> 01:03:29.373
No. No, I'm not kidding.

01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:32.875
But...

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:35.377
But she's fine.
She...

01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:36.745
She's okay.

01:03:36.745 --> 01:03:40.115
It's just a sprain,
but spent the entire night
in the hospital.

01:03:40.115 --> 01:03:43.018
She could've...
broken her neck,
cracked her head open.

01:03:44.018 --> 01:03:45.954
But she didn't...

01:03:45.954 --> 01:03:47.056
She's fine.

01:03:49.056 --> 01:03:51.526
No need to overreact.

01:03:51.526 --> 01:03:52.396
Overreact?

01:03:54.396 --> 01:03:56.331
(sighs)

01:03:56.331 --> 01:03:58.400
Am I overreacting?

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.339
-A little bit.
-Because this is
your fault.

01:04:04.339 --> 01:04:06.541
This is my fault?

01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:07.976
Yeah, that's right.

01:04:07.976 --> 01:04:10.412
You're the one who pushed
her into horse-riding in
the first place.

01:04:10.412 --> 01:04:12.414
If it wasn't for you,
none of this would've
happened.

01:04:12.414 --> 01:04:15.651
I didn't push her
into anything.

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:19.554
Your little girl loves
riding horses as much
as I do.

01:04:19.554 --> 01:04:22.524
Can't you see that?

01:04:22.524 --> 01:04:23.759
You just don't get it,
do you?

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:26.495
-I don't get it?
-You don't, because that
little girl in there

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:29.063
is everything to me,
and you bet,

01:04:29.063 --> 01:04:32.467
'cause I'm not going to let
anything happen to her, ever.

01:04:32.467 --> 01:04:34.504
-Then nothing
will happen to her.
-Precisely.

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:38.476
No, I mean, then "nothing"
will happen to her.

01:04:41.476 --> 01:04:43.578
She'll learn nothing
about life.

01:04:43.578 --> 01:04:45.213
How to take care
of herself,

01:04:45.213 --> 01:04:46.581
responsibility.

01:04:46.581 --> 01:04:49.584
I mean, she's a teenager,
not a china doll that you
put on display.

01:04:49.584 --> 01:04:50.886
Maybe what I should do is,

01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:54.623
I should teach her to be
this hard-edged,
tough-talking bad girl.

01:04:54.623 --> 01:04:57.560
So strong, right?
She can't let anyone in.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.032
Like you.

01:05:05.032 --> 01:05:06.104
Is that what you
really think about me?

01:05:09.104 --> 01:05:10.608
(sighs)

01:05:13.608 --> 01:05:15.045
Wow!

01:05:18.045 --> 01:05:19.087
Okay, then.

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:26.221
Have a good night,
Michael.

01:05:26.221 --> 01:05:27.380
Yeah, good night.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.398
I wish this was
easier, Mr. Harrison.

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:11.500
I'm sorry.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.570
I'm sorry
Holly had to go.

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:17.206
Holly will be okay, hon.

01:06:18.206 --> 01:06:19.610
She'll be in good hands.

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:23.612
(crying) You promised...

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:25.149
You wouldn't let
them take her.

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:28.718
I know.

01:06:29.718 --> 01:06:31.353
Sometimes people make

01:06:31.353 --> 01:06:33.789
promises
with the best intentions,

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.059
and it's just impossible.

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:39.802
Chloe, come on.
Get your things.

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:48.472
You're not just gonna
let him leave, are you?

01:06:50.472 --> 01:06:52.842
You heard what he said.

01:06:53.842 --> 01:06:55.678
He wants to go.

01:06:56.678 --> 01:06:58.680
No, I heard him say,

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.849
Sam, you are
a pain in the butt,

01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:03.718
and if you don't shape up
and tell me how you feel
about me,

01:07:03.718 --> 01:07:05.787
I'm going to be
gone forever.

01:07:05.787 --> 01:07:09.191
And if you weren't such
a stubborn little mule,

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:10.806
you would've heard
the same thing.

01:07:24.806 --> 01:07:28.612
Maybe it's not the best
idea to leave without
trying to make up with Sam.

01:07:30.612 --> 01:07:31.880
How did you know
that we were fighting?

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.683
I heard that you were
fighting last night.

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:37.486
You know, every once
in a while I used to hear
Mom and you fighting,

01:07:37.486 --> 01:07:39.654
but by the next day,
you'd make up.

01:07:39.654 --> 01:07:41.524
Yeah, well,
she's not your mom.

01:07:42.524 --> 01:07:44.159
I know that.

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:46.128
But I like her.

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:48.631
And she's right,
I'm not a doll, Dad.

01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:51.333
You know what?
Okay, fine.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:55.504
Everybody wants to accuse me
of being over-protective,
so what?

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:57.639
It's not such
a bad thing.

01:07:57.639 --> 01:07:59.641
I mean, I get it,
she's got a point,

01:07:59.641 --> 01:08:02.845
but sometimes in life,
people are just
too different, Chloe.

01:08:03.845 --> 01:08:05.887
Or too alike.

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:14.173
I'm gonna get some
stuff at the office.

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:33.877
You're gonna have to get
a new boss, King.

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:37.214
You were right.

01:08:39.214 --> 01:08:40.582
I'm hard-edged...

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:42.785
pain in the butt.

01:08:43.785 --> 01:08:45.821
Yeah, that's true.

01:08:46.821 --> 01:08:49.724
What I said to you
the other night...

01:08:49.724 --> 01:08:51.662
(sighing) I was
way out of line.

01:08:54.662 --> 01:08:56.801
(sighs) Look...

01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:02.839
I don't want
you to go.

01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:06.809
I'd really like
you to stay...

01:09:07.809 --> 01:09:09.781
and go with me
to the ball.

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:14.452
I would love that.

01:09:17.452 --> 01:09:19.423
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:22.524
-Hey!
-Hey! Hi.

01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:24.326
Um, I forgot to
give this to you.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.560
-What is that?
-Um, I found it
in the old cabin.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.332
I think it belonged
to your mom, Sam.

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:32.768
My mom?

01:09:33.768 --> 01:09:35.937
Oh! (chuckles)

01:09:35.937 --> 01:09:37.738
Is that Uncle Buddy?

01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:39.874
-No! Is that him?
-With me and...

01:09:39.874 --> 01:09:42.644
Sydney, yeah.

01:09:42.644 --> 01:09:43.879
Oh, look at that.

01:09:44.879 --> 01:09:46.982
Wait a minute.

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:49.384
These are the
airline stock options.

01:09:49.384 --> 01:09:50.685
Yeah?

01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:53.723
Your mother got a letter
from this company a while
back...

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:56.558
and I forgot to call.

01:09:56.558 --> 01:09:58.527
I mean, is that a big deal?
Should we follow up?

01:09:59.527 --> 01:10:01.263
Worth a shot.

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:02.497
Okay.

01:10:02.497 --> 01:10:03.967
Well, let's follow up.
Let's give 'em a call.

01:10:05.967 --> 01:10:08.472
-You should've waited
for the cards to accumulate.
-I have one card!

01:10:10.472 --> 01:10:12.674
Guys! Guess what?

01:10:12.674 --> 01:10:13.942
-You're staying?
-Yeah!

01:10:13.942 --> 01:10:15.945
Not only are we staying...

01:10:16.945 --> 01:10:19.046
-The farm is safe!
-Sydney: Wait. What?

01:10:19.046 --> 01:10:23.318
Okay, it turns out that
Uncle Buddy's next big
thing finally paid off,

01:10:23.318 --> 01:10:26.488
and Mom's airline stock
is worth a fortune.

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:27.556
We're rich!

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.557
-We're like,
disgustingly rich!
-You're rich!

01:10:29.557 --> 01:10:30.024
-Congrats! Ben...
-Great job.

01:10:31.024 --> 01:10:33.561
-Cliff: What? Are you serious?
This is not a joke?
-No joke! No joke!

01:10:33.561 --> 01:10:35.830
Way to go, man.
Chloe found 'em.

01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:37.932
-Come here, Chloe!
Right here.
-All right.

01:10:37.932 --> 01:10:39.074
(excited chattering)

01:10:47.074 --> 01:10:48.613
(knock on door)

01:10:51.613 --> 01:10:53.481
-Good morning.
-Good morning!

01:10:53.481 --> 01:10:55.417
-Good morning.
-Guess where we're
going today?

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:57.452
We're going to spend
all day pampering

01:10:57.452 --> 01:10:59.521
and beautifying,
and by this afternoon,

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:01.456
-the boys won't even
recognize us.
-Sweet.

01:11:01.456 --> 01:11:03.560
-Come on.
-Bye, Dad.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.962
Nice shirt.

01:11:07.962 --> 01:11:09.598
Chloe: I gave it to him!

01:11:10.598 --> 01:11:12.935
-See you later.
-Bye.

01:11:13.935 --> 01:11:16.338
So, what you're telling me is,
you have no idea where he is

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:18.007
and you don't know
when he's gonna be back?
Is that what you're saying?

01:11:20.007 --> 01:11:22.042
Uh-huh.

01:11:22.042 --> 01:11:24.012
Okay, thanks...
for nothing.

01:11:25.012 --> 01:11:27.453
-Hey, Michael,
Cliff was wondering--
-One sec, Ben.

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.355
One sec.

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:34.624
-I've got you.
-You okay?

01:11:36.624 --> 01:11:37.992
I've got you.

01:11:37.992 --> 01:11:39.928
Do you know where
the bankers took Holly?

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.930
-Um, yeah. Why?
-How far away is it?

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.966
It's not far,
like 10 minutes.

01:11:44.966 --> 01:11:46.470
Come with me.

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.006
We're gonna see a man
about a horse.

01:11:53.006 --> 01:11:54.843
Would you like me
to do your hair?

01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.845
Yeah, sure.

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:58.513
Let's see.
Oh, wow.

01:11:58.513 --> 01:12:00.715
Beautiful hair.

01:12:00.715 --> 01:12:01.984
Hey, who's this?

01:12:02.984 --> 01:12:06.521
Oh! That's my mama
and Uncle Buddy.

01:12:06.521 --> 01:12:08.055
He's funny-looking.

01:12:08.055 --> 01:12:10.027
Yeah, we got our looks
from our mom's side of
the family.

01:12:13.027 --> 01:12:14.963
But he did save the farm.

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:17.070
I just wish that we wouldn't
have left Holly go so soon.

01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:24.907
So should we go up?

01:12:25.907 --> 01:12:28.042
Like that kind of thing?

01:12:28.042 --> 01:12:29.911
-Like French twists.
-Or down?

01:12:29.911 --> 01:12:31.179
You're gonna need
a lot of bobby pins.

01:12:31.179 --> 01:12:33.182
-And hairspray.
We got it.
-Oh, yeah.

01:12:34.182 --> 01:12:35.422
(car approaching)

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:41.790
Just waiting on
some paperwork

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:43.458
and then we'll get
Holly loaded up in
the trailer.

01:12:43.458 --> 01:12:44.660
Sounds good.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.861
You expecting someone?

01:12:46.861 --> 01:12:47.731
No.

01:12:49.731 --> 01:12:51.767
-Hey, Bill!
-What are you doing here?

01:12:52.767 --> 01:12:54.969
-Where's Holly?
-Holly?

01:12:54.969 --> 01:12:56.871
Well, I thought
we covered this, Michael.

01:12:56.871 --> 01:12:58.473
Holly's been ceased
for non-payment.

01:12:58.473 --> 01:13:00.009
She's being prepared
for transport as we speak.

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:04.212
Being that we're in
the country and all,
I gotta say this...

01:13:04.212 --> 01:13:06.850
We can do this the easy way
or we can do this the hard way.

01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:10.885
What are you
talking about?

01:13:10.885 --> 01:13:12.020
Ben, you ever heard
of Masters Folly?

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:16.524
I... Oh, yeah.
Wasn't that, that
famous race horse?

01:13:16.524 --> 01:13:18.860
Evidently. See, it turns out
that Holly could be

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:21.196
the surviving member
of Masters' lineage.

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:22.965
But you already knew that,
didn't you, Bill?

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:27.735
'Cause you were planning on
selling her, for what? Ten times
the amount you credited us for?

01:13:27.735 --> 01:13:30.738
And didn't you find
authentication
papers on Holly?

01:13:30.738 --> 01:13:33.174
Michael: Yes,
and I had them
verified this morning.

01:13:33.174 --> 01:13:35.543
Turns out you
were right, Bill.

01:13:35.543 --> 01:13:37.045
She is horse royalty.

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:39.681
And I'm sure the bank
would be very interested

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:42.819
to know that you were
planning on sticking the
difference in your own pocket.

01:13:44.819 --> 01:13:46.921
So, I'm gonna ask you,

01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:48.790
we can do this the easy way,

01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:50.292
or we can do this
the hard way.

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:52.961
-Ben: I like the hard way.
-Yeah, the hard way
is getting my vote, too.

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:55.063
Look, we can work
something out.

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:56.898
Good.

01:13:56.898 --> 01:13:58.040
Now get us our horse.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.981
Hey, girls, y'all better
get down here. I think you're
going to wanna see this.

01:14:12.981 --> 01:14:14.722
Well, I'll be...
(laughing)

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:23.132
I think we have
a missing family
member of yours.

01:14:31.132 --> 01:14:33.268
Thank you, Michael.

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:36.608
-You got it.
-I can't believe
you brought her back.

01:14:40.608 --> 01:14:43.879
(exclaiming)

01:14:44.879 --> 01:14:46.214
-Holly!
-Holly!

01:14:46.214 --> 01:14:48.151
Hi, baby.

01:14:50.151 --> 01:14:51.227
Good girl.

01:14:59.227 --> 01:15:00.395
(sighs)

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:03.798
Hey, Dad, I wanted
to give you your
Christmas present now.

01:15:03.798 --> 01:15:05.567
What?

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:06.768
Open it.

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:08.803
Sweetheart, you didn't
have to do that.

01:15:08.803 --> 01:15:10.138
-Come on.
-What? Now?

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:11.839
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:11.839 --> 01:15:13.213
Okay. All right.

01:15:19.213 --> 01:15:22.183
(laughing)

01:15:22.183 --> 01:15:24.686
"The World's Best Dad!"

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:27.889
I... love them!

01:15:27.889 --> 01:15:29.190
I love you, Daddy.

01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:31.259
Even when you
drive me nuts.

01:15:31.259 --> 01:15:33.761
And let's face it,
you needed better pajamas.

01:15:33.761 --> 01:15:36.798
Yes, and these are
very high-fashion.
So, thank you.

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.199
When did you do this?

01:15:38.199 --> 01:15:39.001
Oh, Sam helped me.

01:15:40.001 --> 01:15:41.636
-She did?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:15:41.636 --> 01:15:43.638
Wow.

01:15:43.638 --> 01:15:46.841
I happen to have
an early Christmas
present for you, too.

01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:48.988
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:01.890
That was your mom's.

01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:04.959
That was my gift to her

01:16:04.959 --> 01:16:07.930
for giving me... you.

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:10.331
Thanks, Dad.

01:16:10.331 --> 01:16:11.799
-I love it.
-Do you?

01:16:11.799 --> 01:16:14.140
-Mmm-hmm.
-Well, there's more. Here.

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:22.744
A year's worth of
riding lessons! Seriously?

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:24.412
Thanks, Dad.

01:16:24.412 --> 01:16:27.683
I'm going to work
on giving you some
more space. Okay?

01:16:28.683 --> 01:16:30.083
Okay. Thank you.

01:16:30.083 --> 01:16:30.019
Within reason.

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:34.322
-Of course.
-Because I'm still your dad.

01:16:34.322 --> 01:16:36.431
-I know.
-Now go get ready.

01:16:43.431 --> 01:16:45.267
Need to gain
some weight.

01:16:46.267 --> 01:16:47.402
(jazz music playing)

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.976
(no audible dialogue)

01:17:28.976 --> 01:17:32.772
(jazz music continuing)

01:17:57.772 --> 01:17:59.240
I gotta go.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.776
-Hey!
-(gasps) Oh, my gosh.

01:18:01.776 --> 01:18:03.344
-How'd I do?
Do you like it?
-Oh, my gosh,

01:18:03.344 --> 01:18:05.113
you look so beautiful!

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:06.219
Thank you. So do you.

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:13.321
-I just finished
talking to Michael.
-Yeah?

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:15.390
I think you should
give him a chance.

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.365
-Really?
-Really.

01:18:24.365 --> 01:18:25.101
(sighs) You're bad.

01:18:27.101 --> 01:18:29.337
Hi, Gilbert.
It's so good
to see you.

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:32.038
-Have you met my sister?
-Hello.

01:18:32.038 --> 01:18:33.376
-I'm gonna take him around.
-Yeah.

01:18:35.376 --> 01:18:37.345
See, I knew you
would like it here.

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:41.082
I never doubted my
executive assistant
for a second.

01:18:41.082 --> 01:18:42.450
That's right.

01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:43.286
Thanks, Nikki.

01:18:45.286 --> 01:18:48.122
-Hey!
-Michael, how you doing, buddy?

01:18:48.122 --> 01:18:51.058
Good. Good. Listen,
I'm looking for Sam.

01:18:51.058 --> 01:18:54.195
Well, you might try outside.
She's not big on large crowds.

01:18:54.195 --> 01:18:56.998
-Okay, I will.
-Hey, man, I want to talk
to you about something.

01:18:56.998 --> 01:18:58.366
Now that you're going
to be around a lot,

01:18:58.366 --> 01:19:00.002
you know, with Chloe's
riding lessons and all,

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.404
I'd like to see you
have your own space.

01:19:03.404 --> 01:19:05.473
You know that guest house...

01:19:05.473 --> 01:19:08.376
-Yeah?
-It's for you.

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:11.512
-Mr. Harrison...
-You call me Cliff.

01:19:11.512 --> 01:19:12.915
Cliff.

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:16.417
I mean, I don't know what
to say, thank you so much.

01:19:16.417 --> 01:19:18.153
You're welcome.
You've earned it.

01:19:19.153 --> 01:19:21.222
You really have.
I appreciate your help.

01:19:21.222 --> 01:19:22.323
Thank you, sir.

01:19:22.323 --> 01:19:24.826
One more thing,
on your next visit,

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:28.262
we'll sit down...
We'll talk about that
office in the barn.

01:19:28.262 --> 01:19:30.431
Well, I'm not so
sure about that.

01:19:30.431 --> 01:19:33.504
I'm kind of liking King
as my counting assistant,
you know?

01:19:36.504 --> 01:19:37.578
(sighing)

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:44.011
Thank you.

01:19:45.011 --> 01:19:46.247
You're welcome.

01:19:46.247 --> 01:19:47.582
Well...

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:49.284
Looks like we
saved the farm.

01:19:50.284 --> 01:19:52.353
Yes. By the skin
of our teeth.

01:19:52.353 --> 01:19:53.122
Yes.

01:19:55.122 --> 01:19:56.991
But you going the extra
mile like you did,

01:19:56.991 --> 01:19:58.361
and bringing Holly home...

01:20:00.361 --> 01:20:03.497
I really can't
thank you enough.

01:20:03.497 --> 01:20:05.466
Well, I couldn't leave
things the way they were.

01:20:05.466 --> 01:20:07.903
Holly wanted to be back
with her family.

01:20:08.903 --> 01:20:10.340
I'm really happy
for you guys.

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.808
Thank you.

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:17.511
You know, I had the most
interesting conversation
with Mrs. Parker earlier.

01:20:17.511 --> 01:20:19.413
Ah! Do tell.

01:20:19.413 --> 01:20:22.383
Oh, do you remember
Mr. Parker, the gentleman
that was gonna take his

01:20:22.383 --> 01:20:24.252
business down
the road to K&T?

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:25.419
Yes, of course.

01:20:25.419 --> 01:20:27.488
Well, he didn't tell
Mrs. Parker.

01:20:27.488 --> 01:20:29.457
-Ooh, that's bad.
-Yeah.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:30.625
That's real bad.

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:32.894
She's not having it.

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.428
So they aren't leaving.

01:20:34.428 --> 01:20:36.397
They even gave
a six month advance.

01:20:36.397 --> 01:20:38.501
Well, that is
a happy ending.

01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:42.503
Is it?

01:20:42.503 --> 01:20:43.442
What do you mean?

01:20:48.442 --> 01:20:50.011
Well, what's going
to happen with us?

01:20:51.011 --> 01:20:52.047
Are we going to have
a happy ending?

01:20:54.047 --> 01:20:55.984
According to your
father we are.

01:20:56.984 --> 01:20:59.923
My daddy gave you the keys
to the guest house and didn't
tell me?

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:04.562
You say the word
and I'm gonna give 'em
right back to him.

01:21:08.562 --> 01:21:10.464
Well, it just turns out,

01:21:10.464 --> 01:21:13.568
that I have a thing for
hot city boy accountants.

01:21:14.568 --> 01:21:15.448
That's good.

01:21:27.448 --> 01:21:28.950
Chloe, it's snowing!

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:30.551
It's snowing!

01:21:30.551 --> 01:21:32.122
It's snowing!
Dad, look, it's snowing!

01:21:35.122 --> 01:21:36.724
It wasn't supposed to snow!

01:21:36.724 --> 01:21:38.960
-Oh, my goodness!
-Would you look at this!

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.528
Merry Christmas, honey!

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:42.465
(excited chattering)

01:21:44.465 --> 01:21:47.068
Cliff:
Nobody said
anything about snow.

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:49.000
(chattering continuing) 

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:56.174
