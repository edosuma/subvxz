WEBVTT

00:15.056 --> 00:16.266
[door opens]

00:17.767 --> 00:20.395
-Will you stop breaking into my room?
-Time's up.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.480
-Hamish and Lilith are looking for you.
-Good.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.691
-Let them kill me.
-Whoa!

00:25.358 --> 00:27.902
As your RA,
it kind of sounds like you're depressed.

00:27.986 --> 00:31.072
And this whole look... supports my theory.

00:31.156 --> 00:35.076
I just killed my Ethics professor!
I woke up next to his dead body.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.247
I'm covered in his blood. I think one of
his tendons is stuck in my fucking teeth!

00:39.998 --> 00:40.999
Oh, yeah!

00:41.458 --> 00:43.793
-Flossing is your friend.
-That's all you have to say?

00:43.877 --> 00:45.920
If Silverback killed
your Ethics professor,

00:46.004 --> 00:47.589
he must have had a good reason.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.133
What's the last thing you remember?

00:51.259 --> 00:53.595
I was with Benson. Outside of her house.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.514
What if I killed her too?

01:01.478 --> 01:03.354
[Randall] Leaving evidence
of a transformation?

01:03.855 --> 01:06.191
Sloppy, dude. [tsks]

01:12.030 --> 01:12.864
[bangs on door]

01:12.947 --> 01:14.199
Professor Benson!

01:17.368 --> 01:18.203
[bangs on door]

01:18.286 --> 01:19.329
Professor! Hello!

01:19.871 --> 01:21.039
Looks clear to me.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.833
Why were you here anyway?

01:25.210 --> 01:27.837
-'Cause I thought she was in danger.
-What kind of danger?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.297
Magical danger, okay?

01:29.422 --> 01:31.925
-You let Silverback do his thing. Nice!
-No!

01:32.008 --> 01:35.220
No, not nice, because I slaughtered
my Ethics professor.

01:35.303 --> 01:36.638
Dude, relax.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.557
Everything looks normal,
and I don't smell any blood.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.645
The longer you wear the hide,
the stronger your senses become.

01:43.728 --> 01:46.523
-Oh, wow. Sign me up then.
-You'll say the oath?

01:46.606 --> 01:49.943
What part of "I slaughtered
my Ethics professor" did you miss?

01:50.026 --> 01:52.821
Well, nothing here tells me
you killed your English professor.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.198
-You're sure?
-Solid...

01:55.490 --> 01:57.158
-sixty percent.
-[sighs deeply]

01:57.992 --> 02:00.120
Okay, do me a favor and check around back.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.454
I'm telling you, dude...

02:03.373 --> 02:04.582
Okay, okay.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.585
[Randall]
Be right back. Don't go anywhere.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.462
You owe me!

02:11.840 --> 02:16.136
So, you want to resign as Jack's tutor?

02:16.511 --> 02:18.847
It's more like I need to.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.850
That's not very subservient.

02:21.933 --> 02:25.019
It's not for me. The Grand Magus wants me
to continue to assist him.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.021
Continue.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.732
So, you've solved his little riddle.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.277
[chuckles] It contained part of a book.

02:32.610 --> 02:33.736
I'm not sure what it is,

02:33.820 --> 02:37.490
but... it's old and someone definitely
wanted it to remain hidden.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.659
It was protected by an Echo Incantation.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.247
Hmm.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.624
You're on quite the adventure.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.793
Find out why that book is so important.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.005
Thank you.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.719
This is the part where you leave.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.805
He also asked me to tell you

03:01.264 --> 03:04.434
that he needs exclusive use of the temple
for the next few days.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.938
Well, you tell the Grand Magus
it would be my honor.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.401
Ms. Drake, one more thing.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.865
Edward has a way of making you feel

03:19.032 --> 03:23.119
like you are <i>the</i> most important person
in the universe.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.163
You are not.

03:33.504 --> 03:36.174
[quiet chatter]

03:36.257 --> 03:38.384
[Jack] Brandon! Where's Professor Benson?

03:38.468 --> 03:41.596
Relax. She's in the hospital.
Some kind of car accident.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.807
Relax? Look, she could have died,
and we could have killed her.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.394
We? Don't try to take credit for this.
This was all me and Gabrielle.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.354
It has to stop.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.190
[sniffs] You sound like my dad
when I slept with his trainer.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.441
[Randall] Hey, Jack!

03:54.150 --> 03:55.235
[Brandon] Who's that?

03:55.860 --> 03:56.861
It's my RA.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.029
Introduce me!

03:58.488 --> 04:00.031
Don't do that spell again.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.116
Why would we? It didn't even work.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.456
Thanks for ditching me. It's not like
I know exactly where to come.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.667
-That one of your Order buddies?
-That's Brandon.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.502
-What were you talking about?
-Never mind.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.672
I gotta tell you, dude,
so far, you are a lousy double agent.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.883
I am no one's agent.
Look, Benson is alive.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.052
-Great.
-But she's in the hospital.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.097
Werewolf attack?

04:24.180 --> 04:26.182
-Hit by a car.
-[sighs] That's a relief.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.685
After all this, it'd blow
if you had to kill her.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.021
-Kill?
-Come on, let's eat.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.274
We need to figure out
how to keep you alive.

04:39.612 --> 04:40.697
Sure you don't want one?

04:40.780 --> 04:42.282
[clears throat] Not hungry.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.450
Right. Ethics professor.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.412
-You probably filled up on his heart.
-That's not funny, man.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.790
Not a joke. Eating heart is
a Knights of Saint Christopher tradition.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.375
Why would you do that?

04:52.458 --> 04:54.085
I just told you. Tradition.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.671
[sighs deeply]

04:56.754 --> 04:58.840
I thought I had the transformation
under control.

04:58.923 --> 05:01.551
You said Benson was in danger, right?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.595
-So you were worried about her.
-Of course I was.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.265
Well, there you go. You're worried,
Silverback hates magic.

05:07.348 --> 05:08.808
Together, you fight crime.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.519
-I don't want this, Randall.
-Look, I get it.

05:11.602 --> 05:14.063
It's a big change.
It takes time to adjust.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.233
Hell, Greybeard killed three people
before I learned how to control him.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.484
What is wrong with you?

05:19.068 --> 05:22.947
I mean, you talk about murder the way
other people talk about picking a movie.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.575
-It wasn't me--
-Yeah, yeah. It was Greybeard.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.534
[Alyssa] Greybeard?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.747
-Yeah, my, uh...
-His...

05:30.913 --> 05:32.999
My D&D character.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.167
Battle Elf.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.837
With a plus thirty charisma.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.548
Rib?

05:41.215 --> 05:42.175
No, thanks.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.719
I won't be able to tutor you anymore.

05:44.802 --> 05:45.636
Oh, uh...

05:45.928 --> 05:48.806
I haven't been doing any of that, uh,
that stuff...

05:49.349 --> 05:50.850
you don't want me to, I swear.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.061
It's not that. It's...

05:54.228 --> 05:55.355
all that other stuff.

05:56.147 --> 05:56.981
Oh.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.525
I get it.

06:00.026 --> 06:00.985
I take it back.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.072
I mean, I don't,
but if it makes you feel better, I do.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.908
No. I'm working on a new project.
With someone else.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.368
Oh.

06:08.868 --> 06:12.872
And I need to put all my energy
into this... new project.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.165
I just...

06:15.708 --> 06:17.126
thought you should hear it from me.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.011
Dude, constructive criticism?

06:27.887 --> 06:29.764
You have to work on your game.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.432
And your charisma.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.392
[sighs]

06:33.601 --> 06:36.729
I can't live like this, Randall.
I'm a time bomb.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.357
I'm a wolf time bomb.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.485
<i>-</i>A killer wolf time bomb.
-You're a bomb, I get it.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.071
But I can help.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.198
You trust me?

06:47.615 --> 06:49.826
Not at all. But what choice do I have?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.494
That's the spirit.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.663
Um, check, please.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.831
[door opens]

06:56.124 --> 06:58.543
You're sure you can get Hamish
and Lilith on board?

06:58.626 --> 07:00.211
Oh, yeah. Absolutely, no problem.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.129
Hamish!

07:01.754 --> 07:02.755
Lilith!

07:03.047 --> 07:04.799
Great job, Randall.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.593
I thought for sure
you were going to help him run.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.429
You double-crossing bastard.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.432
Everyone calm down.
No one's killing anyone.

07:12.598 --> 07:16.018
We agreed. Best out of three.
You lost, he dies.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.146
Jack landed his first kill.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.897
Big bad magic.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.275
-Bullshit.
-Jack, tell them.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.237
Tell them how you heard the ringing
and transformed into Silverback

07:26.320 --> 07:28.906
and took down your professor
who was weaponized by bad magic.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.825
That… that happened.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.994
That's straight-up champion shit.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.913
And pretty impressive,
considering he hasn't even been trained.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.332
Doesn't change the fact
that he's been doing bad magic.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.418
-That was a mistake.
-[Randall] And he's very sorry.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.671
-You're a mistake.
-We need to discuss this alone.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.883
What are we gonna do about dick leak here?
We can't just let him go.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.801
She's right.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.138
-Randall!
-[Randall] Guys!

07:52.221 --> 07:53.890
Don't do anything weird.

07:54.265 --> 07:57.560
Like lock somebody in your basement while
you debate whether or not to kill them?

07:57.643 --> 07:58.936
Yeah, like that.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.400
[sighs deeply]

08:04.775 --> 08:06.444
Lie to them about what happened.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.571
-That was your plan?
-It's not lying.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.532
It's... optimistic expectation.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.118
I never said Clarke was
"weaponized by bad magic."

08:14.202 --> 08:15.536
You never said he wasn't.

08:16.078 --> 08:19.165
Look, it's going to be okay. I promise.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.584
It's gonna take a couple hours.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.960
[door bangs shut]

08:33.095 --> 08:34.138
Alyssa!

08:35.014 --> 08:36.349
Good afternoon.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.019
-How are you feeling?
-Oh, I'm good as new.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.396
Excellent.
You're gonna need your strength.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.525
All the magic I learned over the years,

08:45.608 --> 08:47.944
that's the one I use the most.
Never gets old.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.280
[sighing] Alyssa.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.450
Meet Sir Richard De Payne.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.169
You're pretty quiet.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.254
[Alyssa sighs]

09:07.338 --> 09:09.048
Out of respect, Grand Magus.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.968
Silence, subservience, observance.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.345
Hey, between you and me...

09:15.304 --> 09:17.974
I don't believe in unquestionable loyalty.

09:18.307 --> 09:21.143
I never gave it... I don't expect it.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.229
So...

09:23.896 --> 09:25.314
as my protégé...

09:26.315 --> 09:28.150
go ahead. Ask me anything you want.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.322
The book that was hidden
inside the obsidian,

09:33.739 --> 09:34.615
what was it?

09:34.699 --> 09:36.617
Part of The Vade Maecum Infernal.

09:37.577 --> 09:41.122
The most powerful incantation
ever created.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.083
What does it do?

09:44.959 --> 09:47.378
This is more
of a "what doesn't it do" scenario.

09:47.878 --> 09:48.713
[sighs]

09:48.921 --> 09:50.965
So it's in pieces for a reason.

09:51.507 --> 09:52.883
Centuries ago...

09:53.551 --> 09:57.013
a few practitioners decided that
The Vade Maecum was too powerful.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.724
So they broke it apart...

10:00.641 --> 10:01.809
and hid the pieces.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.730
That doesn't mean that people
haven't stopped trying to find it.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.693
And was Sir Richard
one of those practitioners?

10:11.485 --> 10:13.237
He's one of the hiding places.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.490
What? Like the obsidian?

10:21.329 --> 10:23.039
The book's hidden inside a corpse?

10:23.789 --> 10:24.915
Yes and no.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.085
[Sir Richard coughs]

10:28.794 --> 10:29.962
He's not really dead.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.216
[Lilith] Okay.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.552
So, I say we kill him.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.928
You always say that.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.057
-And I'm always right.
-Might be a waste of a good champion.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.558
He's no champion.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.728
He is a member of the Order.
He is our enemy.

10:46.062 --> 10:49.148
The guilt he's feeling
is punishment enough.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.359
The guy's a breakup song on repeat.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.277
Aw! He feels bad?

10:53.611 --> 10:56.447
-Why didn't you say so?
-Come up with a punishment

10:56.530 --> 10:59.825
that doesn't involve slicing open
an artery and we'll talk.

10:59.909 --> 11:04.121
Guys, we all know
there's only one way to solve this.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.873
[Randall] Woo!

11:06.207 --> 11:07.041
Drink.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.628
You realize your behavior borders
on pathological.

11:15.925 --> 11:16.967
[Lilith belches]

11:21.639 --> 11:24.350
Hey! This isn't a library.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.060
I was doing some research.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.771
Who doesn’t want to spend their
last day alive reading some old book?

11:29.438 --> 11:31.315
Your reliquary is almost as good
as the Order's.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.694
-Reliquary?
-Your collection of magical artifacts.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.780
-That's not ours.
-This is magical contraband.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.074
Confiscated by the Knights
over the centuries.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.784
Think of this as an evidence locker.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.704
Well, then you might wanna do
a better job of securing it.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.664
Some of this stuff is pretty valuable.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.791
It's in the basement of a house
with three werewolves.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.167
I think it's fine.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.087
-Have you ever read any of this stuff?
-Of course not.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.881
We fight bad magic. We don't perform it.

11:55.965 --> 11:56.841
[Jack] That's too bad.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.968
You might learn something.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.721
Do you know
why you eat your victims' hearts?

12:01.804 --> 12:04.515
Dude, how many times
do I have to tell you? Tradition.

12:04.598 --> 12:07.393
No. You do it
to stop the path of the magic.

12:07.601 --> 12:11.105
Okay. "If you don't eat the heart,
the magic continues on its way,

12:11.522 --> 12:15.109
following the necessary path
to perform thy practitioner's bidding."

12:17.278 --> 12:18.446
Well, fuck me.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.323
[Jack] There's a lot in here
about the hides and their champions.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.492
Greybeard is the fearless one.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.035
Sounds about right.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.746
Tundra, the most cunning.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.249
-Midnight is the reckless one.
-We call him "Cannon Fodder."

12:32.168 --> 12:34.962
I guess that makes you, Timber,
a loner.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.299
You got a problem
with an independent wolf?

12:38.382 --> 12:41.302
Not at all.
But here's the thing about Silverback.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.888
He's the most powerful.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.266
-You're saying you want to be in charge?
-No, thanks.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.810
But we do want the same thing.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.439
Look, you guys
want to take down bad magic.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.192
I want to take down a bad magician.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.361
I'm proposing an alliance.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.197
Who's your bad guy?

13:02.239 --> 13:03.199
Edward Coventry.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.910
He's the leader of The Order,
and he's...

13:06.660 --> 13:08.037
responsible for my mother's death.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.873
We don't do revenge.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.000
Yeah, you just kill people at random.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.712
-I'll kill you.
-Thank you for proving my point.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.800
Guys, we can help each other.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.180
He should've had a choice.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.557
We didn't give him one.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.104
We'll try an alliance.

13:35.606 --> 13:36.440
For now.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.153
Let's get to work, rookie.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.823
[Edward]
<i>Today we're going to try a potion.</i>

13:44.532 --> 13:46.283
<i>Somnus Adveniat.</i>

13:47.284 --> 13:49.453
-[Alyssa] A sleeping potion?
-[Edward] Close.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.205
[Alyssa] <i>Somnus Adveniat.</i>

13:52.623 --> 13:53.624
The dream realm.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.085
Sir Richard here

13:56.544 --> 13:59.672
is in the middle of a single,
never-ending dream.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.758
That's where someone placed
part of the book.

14:05.594 --> 14:09.139
The journey inside
requires two practitioners.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.016
You enter the realm...

14:12.643 --> 14:13.853
and I'll be your anchor.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.566
As long as you and I
are bound by this rope...

14:19.483 --> 14:21.902
I can pull you out
of Sir Richard's subconscious.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.660
I'll be right by your side.

14:30.744 --> 14:31.620
Alyssa.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.206
Do you trust me?

14:35.082 --> 14:35.958
Totally.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.004
Okay, this is actually part
of the incantation.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.756
In order for it to work,
you have to say, "I do."

14:45.050 --> 14:45.885
I do.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.230
Mm. Cinnamon.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.532
[Alyssa inhales]

15:09.491 --> 15:11.035
[exhales deeply]

15:12.494 --> 15:13.621
[ringing noise]

15:14.121 --> 15:16.832
-Do you hear that? The ringing?
-Don't worry about it.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.960
-Why must I wear a towel?
-So you don't ruin your clothes.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.171
-Why must you wear a towel?
-Because I'm body-positive.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.839
Now quit changing the subject.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.884
You've taught yourself
how to keep Silverback in.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.929
Now all you have to do is let him out.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.057
Okay?

15:33.140 --> 15:34.016
Okay.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.768
[sighs]

15:36.352 --> 15:38.354
[sputters then babbles]

15:38.771 --> 15:40.356
-Take your time.
-[Jack coughs] Yeah.

15:45.736 --> 15:49.531
[Jack grunting]

15:50.282 --> 15:53.077
-Looks like you're dumping one out.
-You're not helping.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.371
[chuckles] Jack, just...

15:56.038 --> 15:57.831
Stop. Just watch. Just watch.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.667
[clears throat]

16:01.460 --> 16:02.419
[sighs]

16:09.635 --> 16:10.844
[Randall snarls]

16:19.937 --> 16:21.563
That was mildly impressive.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.481
You kidding?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.149
How did you get turned?

16:25.150 --> 16:27.236
Freshman year, I was out for a run

16:27.319 --> 16:30.572
and saw this scumbag try to grab a kid
off a playground.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.867
I chased him down and held him
until the cops arrived.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.496
Hamish saw it. Asked me
if I wanted to join The Brotherhood.

16:38.163 --> 16:38.998
Asked?

16:39.081 --> 16:42.292
Yeah. He gave me this big speech
about power and responsibility,

16:42.376 --> 16:45.212
and I was like, "Dude,
are you talking about superpowers?"

16:45.295 --> 16:47.840
And he said, "Maybe."
And I said, "Sign me up."

16:48.590 --> 16:51.802
Then they took me into the hide locker
and Greybeard chose me.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.471
And you didn't know about the wolf part
until then?

16:54.555 --> 16:56.223
-Nah.
-And you weren't pissed?

16:56.724 --> 16:57.683
Are you kidding?

16:57.766 --> 17:00.728
What would you say if someone asked you
if you wanted to be a superhero?

17:00.811 --> 17:02.730
I don't know 'cause no one asked me.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.248
[echoing] Edward?

17:22.499 --> 17:23.333
Edward?

17:23.709 --> 17:24.585
I'm here.

17:26.670 --> 17:27.671
Look around.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.549
<i>Find a landmark.</i>

17:31.675 --> 17:32.801
<i>You're gonna need one.</i>

17:34.011 --> 17:36.013
-[bang]
-[screams, gasps]

17:36.180 --> 17:37.056
What happened?

17:40.809 --> 17:42.311
He scared me out of his mind.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.855
[Sir Richard groans]

17:49.151 --> 17:49.985
Let's go again.

17:57.910 --> 17:58.827
[sighs]

18:00.579 --> 18:04.917
[Alyssa breathes deeply]

18:13.342 --> 18:16.678
There was this old lady who turned her
husband into some kind of zombie servant.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.098
Found him with his hands
around the mailman's neck,

18:19.181 --> 18:20.933
so naturally I decapitate him.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.977
So, I tracked down the wife.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.396
One quick flick to her carotid

18:26.563 --> 18:29.650
and she's spraying a Jackson Pollack
all over the wall in her own blood.

18:30.734 --> 18:31.568
Cool.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.696
And I came across
three practitioners in the forest,

18:34.780 --> 18:36.824
they'd just sacrificed some rando.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.575
Rip the first one's neck out with my teeth

18:38.659 --> 18:41.328
while I clawed the other two down
simultaneously.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.579
[Lilith chuckles]

18:43.539 --> 18:48.252
So, your battle tactic
is basically "kill them all"?

18:49.002 --> 18:50.212
You go with what works.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.841
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

18:54.466 --> 18:55.384
[gasps]

18:55.467 --> 18:56.927
Grandma, no!

18:57.010 --> 18:59.471
Holy fucking shit balls!

19:00.013 --> 19:04.268
[Hamish] The key to a proper gimlet
is using the lime cordial.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.229
Spend the money on a quality product.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.647
Or better yet,

19:08.730 --> 19:13.110
make it yourself with fresh squeezed
lime juice and simple syrup.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.571
Shake to a foxtrot time.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.329
-And this is teaching me what, exactly?
-Après-kill cocktails.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.372
[Jack laughs]

19:25.455 --> 19:27.082
I never joke about cocktails.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.919
Well, maybe Alabama Slammers,
but they're absurd.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.130
To friends.

19:33.755 --> 19:34.965
Old and new.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.592
And not killing them.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.429
Mm!

19:42.222 --> 19:43.640
Life is like a cocktail.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.100
Complex,

19:45.475 --> 19:48.061
carries a kick, and doesn't last.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.731
So take the time to savor it.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.401
Doesn't last? How "doesn't last"
are we talking about?

19:55.319 --> 19:57.029
I've been a Knight for eight years.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.281
I'm practically geriatric.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.285
You hunt enough bad magic,
bad magic will end up hunting you.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.412
Or you get hit by a car.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.000
The champions are temporary,
but the Knights are eternal.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.794
And that's enough for you?

20:14.671 --> 20:15.881
You ready to try again?

20:18.467 --> 20:19.593
[sighs]

20:24.306 --> 20:25.265
[sighs]

20:26.600 --> 20:27.893
[gasps]

20:27.976 --> 20:29.853
Alyssa! Alyssa! You're all right.

20:30.854 --> 20:31.813
You're awake now.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.690
[Alyssa breathing heavily]

20:33.774 --> 20:34.942
You know where you are?

20:35.776 --> 20:36.902
[sighs]

20:37.402 --> 20:39.154
The temple. I know. Oh.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.200
Oh, man. That one was...
that was...

20:44.284 --> 20:45.160
intense.

20:45.994 --> 20:49.831
This guy's got one twisted imagination.

20:50.457 --> 20:51.917
-Right.
-On the plus side, I...

20:52.000 --> 20:53.669
I made it all the way into his castle.

20:54.586 --> 20:55.420
All right.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.923
[clicks tongue] Let's, uh,
let's call it a night.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.176
Just give me a few minutes.
We can go again.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.053
I saw the book. I...

21:03.971 --> 21:07.349
-I know where it is. I can do it now.
-I believe you. You need some rest.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.435
-I've been asleep all day.
-You know what I mean.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.187
Real rest.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.233
-But we'll try again tomorrow?
-I promise.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.444
[Sir Richard chuckles quietly]

21:28.495 --> 21:29.579
[Jack] It's no use.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.041
-Try again.
-We've been here all night.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.960
-Your point?
-It's not gonna work.

21:35.043 --> 21:38.255
I can't wolf out unless I hear
that damn ringing. I can't control it.

21:38.338 --> 21:41.133
It's 'cause you're throttling down
when you should be giving it some gas.

21:41.216 --> 21:45.053
Don't think of it as losing control.
You're gaining control.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.222
Of what? My homicidal nature?

21:47.306 --> 21:49.141
-Your strength, dumb-ass.
-Lil.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.144
Just let Silverback out.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.230
Accept everything he feels,
wants, remembers.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.898
Accept what I did to Professor Clarke?

21:56.982 --> 21:58.358
Yes, exactly.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.152
Whether you do this or not is up to you.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.862
But you have to choose it.

22:01.987 --> 22:02.821
Okay.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.365
Okay, I'm listening.

22:06.616 --> 22:07.451
Okay.

22:08.869 --> 22:09.911
Close your eyes.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.874
Feel the itch moving through you.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.001
-Can you feel it?
-Yeah.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.878
Okay, chase it.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.047
Grab it.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.800
Randall said to go with the flow.

22:23.884 --> 22:24.885
Randall's an idiot.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.720
Ah, an idiot who's pre-med.

22:26.803 --> 22:29.765
Look, we all have our own experiences
with transforming.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.558
Find yours.

22:34.686 --> 22:35.520
[sighs]

22:35.604 --> 22:39.149
How did you feel
when Benson was in danger?

22:40.942 --> 22:41.985
Worried.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.030
<i>Concerned.</i>

22:46.365 --> 22:48.575
I didn't want her to get... hurt.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.706
[dramatic roar]

22:55.332 --> 22:57.334
[crackling]

22:58.752 --> 23:00.754
[crackling continues]

23:13.100 --> 23:14.267
[crackling stops]

23:16.186 --> 23:19.481
-[piercing ringing]
-[Jack groans]

23:19.564 --> 23:20.399
Jack?

23:21.274 --> 23:22.442
-Jack?
-No...

23:22.526 --> 23:23.944
Tell me what did you take?

23:24.027 --> 23:25.320
[Jack groans]

23:26.488 --> 23:27.406
Eric!

23:28.824 --> 23:31.868
Eric, it's your student.
He's having some kind of episode.

23:33.120 --> 23:33.954
Eric?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.167
-[car revving]
-Eric!

23:39.251 --> 23:40.961
-[tires squealing]
-Eric!

23:41.044 --> 23:42.254
-[car crashes]
-[Benson screams]

23:44.297 --> 23:46.466
Clarke was under some kind
of magical control.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.928
-And I--
-You saved Benson.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.513
I killed someone, okay?

23:51.763 --> 23:53.974
You totally covered for this guy.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.976
-Twice.
-What does it matter?

23:56.059 --> 23:57.644
I still turned out to be right.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.521
How long was I turned?

24:00.063 --> 24:01.815
Not long. About three seconds.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.900
At least he made it
to full wolf this time.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.571
Yeah, but he'll never hold the wolf
unless he quits wallowing in his guilt.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.114
She's right.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.409
You have to trust Silverback.

24:12.492 --> 24:14.494
You keep saying that
like it's separate from me.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.454
It is.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.580
And it isn't.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.206
Totally cleared that up.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.502
Thanks for turning me into a murderer.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.672
What a shit show.
It's a total waste of time.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.924
I'm starting to think Lilith is right.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.634
-Of course I am.
-[Randall] Guys.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.012
He's Silverback.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.016
He's also in The Order.

24:36.516 --> 24:38.810
Maybe that's why Silverback chose him.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.456
Alyssa!

24:59.831 --> 25:01.416
-Hey. Jack.
-Hey.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.586
I... I really don't have time right now.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.381
Listen, I'm sorry
that I messed around with magic.

25:08.757 --> 25:09.841
Because you got caught?

25:09.925 --> 25:12.719
No, because you warned me
about the danger, and I didn't listen.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.264
Well, I'm just glad you figured that out
before somebody got hurt.

25:16.681 --> 25:17.516
Totally.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.392
Can I ask you a question?

25:20.352 --> 25:23.939
I... I have somewhere I have to be.
Edward's expecting me.

25:24.272 --> 25:25.482
That special project?

25:26.733 --> 25:27.943
Wrong question.

25:28.401 --> 25:32.113
Okay, look. I read somewhere that magic
travels along a path.

25:32.197 --> 25:35.659
And if you interrupt that path somehow,
it finds a new route, right?

25:36.409 --> 25:38.286
-Right.
-I was thinking, what if

25:38.703 --> 25:41.623
magic is like a river,
searching for a way to flow.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.584
If I dam up that river, it changes course

25:44.668 --> 25:48.672
and not all that water keeps flowing.
It... becomes a smaller river.

25:48.755 --> 25:49.756
Maybe even a trickle.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.425
Where is this river going?

25:52.842 --> 25:54.511
If I interrupt the magic enough,

25:54.594 --> 25:56.805
and it changes course...

25:57.556 --> 25:59.474
does it lose its strength? Peter out?

26:01.142 --> 26:03.311
Congratulations.
You just figured out a key lesson.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.064
Magic has a half-life.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.025
What are you up to?

26:09.359 --> 26:10.944
I haven't done a spell
since you caught me.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.488
-You promise?
-I promise.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.741
Thank you for not ratting me out.

26:18.827 --> 26:19.828
[Alyssa chuckles]

26:19.953 --> 26:21.121
You're welcome.

26:35.510 --> 26:36.511
[chuckles]

26:36.595 --> 26:39.764
That was wildly inappropriate.

26:41.141 --> 26:44.394
You mean an acolyte kissing his tutor
or his tutor kissing back?

26:45.020 --> 26:46.730
[both laugh]

26:46.813 --> 26:48.231
This never happened.

26:49.774 --> 26:50.692
No.

26:52.235 --> 26:53.320
Your lips are so soft.

26:53.903 --> 26:56.489
-What?
-Oh, okay. I'm...

26:57.532 --> 26:58.366
Bye.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.997
[ringing]

27:11.379 --> 27:13.006
[Jack]
I know who's performing this magic.

27:13.089 --> 27:15.842
-Gabrielle Dupres and Brandon Caruthers.
-How did you--

27:15.925 --> 27:18.470
[Randall] I saw you talking to them,
and they both got into The Order.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.513
Do you really think
I wouldn't figure that out?

27:20.805 --> 27:22.390
Yeah, thanks for the heads-up.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.351
-You can't kill them.
-We can if we hurry.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.687
Look, just let me talk to them first.
You at least owe me that much.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.522
[Jack gasps]

27:29.606 --> 27:31.399
Everything bad
that has happened up until now

27:31.483 --> 27:33.568
is because you haven't listened
to a word we've said.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.780
We don't owe you anything. You understand?

27:37.572 --> 27:38.490
Yes.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.408
[grunts then breathes heavily]

27:44.412 --> 27:45.872
We can stop the magic.

27:45.955 --> 27:48.083
-Without killing anyone.
-How?

27:48.166 --> 27:50.293
I didn't eat Clarke's heart
when I killed him.

27:50.377 --> 27:54.547
So the magic targeting Benson,
it kept going. It found a new path to her.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.925
-The person driving the car.
-[Jack] Exactly.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.094
But the magic started to wear out.
It wasn't...

27:59.219 --> 28:01.763
It was less effective,
that's why Benson wasn't killed.

28:02.097 --> 28:05.225
We can wear a spell down,
render it harmless.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.060
-I heard him.
-[Lilith] That's great,

28:07.227 --> 28:08.728
when we know the target.

28:08.812 --> 28:11.231
I can find out. Just let me talk
to Gabrielle and Brandon.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.859
-This will work.
-Says the expert.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.445
If it doesn't... go ahead and kill me.

28:17.862 --> 28:18.863
Sounds fair to me.

28:21.658 --> 28:22.951
[Hamish] All right, Jack.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.828
What's your plan?

28:54.357 --> 28:55.483
I think I found it.

29:11.916 --> 29:12.876
I can't move it.

29:13.626 --> 29:14.669
What should I do?

29:16.296 --> 29:18.256
Try removing what's underneath it.

29:26.890 --> 29:27.849
[gasps]

29:29.309 --> 29:31.728
-[gasps]
-[Sir Richard growls]

29:32.896 --> 29:35.148
[Sir Richard groans]

29:44.949 --> 29:47.494
[Alyssa grunts]

29:48.536 --> 29:51.790
[Edward gasping] Shut the door.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.168
[Edward gasps]

29:58.588 --> 30:00.799
[Alyssa grunting and panting]

30:04.260 --> 30:06.054
[grunting]

30:13.061 --> 30:13.895
Alyssa!

30:14.229 --> 30:15.063
Wake up!

30:15.897 --> 30:17.440
-Alyssa, wake up.
-[gasps]

30:17.524 --> 30:18.358
Wake up.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.652
[panting]

30:21.778 --> 30:22.779
You're okay.

30:23.988 --> 30:24.906
You're okay.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.209
Yes.

30:37.752 --> 30:38.628
Excellent.

30:40.797 --> 30:41.840
Excellent work.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.049
Thanks.

30:50.890 --> 30:51.724
[Alyssa] Is it?

30:54.227 --> 30:55.186
Let's find out.

31:08.116 --> 31:08.992
Two down.

31:10.618 --> 31:11.536
Two to go.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.166
[Edward sighs]

31:20.128 --> 31:21.212
[sighs]

31:23.131 --> 31:24.257
[chuckles]

31:27.719 --> 31:29.095
Oh, hello!

31:31.180 --> 31:32.557
Do any spells lately?

31:34.225 --> 31:35.310
Guys, come on.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.855
Yeah, not sharing.
Not sure if we could trust you anymore.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.857
We gave you a chance and you blew it.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.234
I need to know
what kind of magic you did.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.028
You might want to watch your tone.

31:45.445 --> 31:48.072
We found a spell
that will turn our enemies inside out.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.408
-Oh, I'm your enemy now?
-That's up to you.

31:50.783 --> 31:51.743
You're not the only one

31:52.327 --> 31:53.786
learning powerful magic.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.580
[both laugh]

31:55.663 --> 31:57.040
<i>Facies mutetur!</i>

31:57.332 --> 31:58.291
[gasps]

31:58.374 --> 32:01.085
[groans]

32:01.169 --> 32:02.128
What the fuck!

32:02.253 --> 32:03.796
[whimpers]

32:04.714 --> 32:07.133
Not the face! Not the face! Not the face!

32:07.216 --> 32:08.426
-Tell me.
-Okay, okay.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.970
We did a spell to not have
any more English tests.

32:11.846 --> 32:12.680
Ever.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.185
Oh, my God!

32:17.268 --> 32:19.270
[both panting]

32:19.687 --> 32:22.774
[Jack] <i>Look, Benson's colleagues</i>
<i>tweeted about a welcome home party.</i>

32:23.149 --> 32:25.234
[Randall] <i>Wow, Jack. Stalk much?</i>

32:27.236 --> 32:30.573
I thought knowing our target
was supposed to make our lives easier.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.534
-How do we know who we're looking for?
-You'll know.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.328
Guys, chill.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.789
English teachers over there.

32:38.581 --> 32:41.584
Knights on a mission out here.
We got this.

32:45.338 --> 32:46.255
[sighs]

32:47.590 --> 32:49.008
Oh. Here we go.

32:50.843 --> 32:51.719
He's mine.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.347
I call dibs on next one.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.393
[Jack] No killing.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.480
-[snarling]
-[gun cocks]

33:05.149 --> 33:07.151
[snarling]

33:12.865 --> 33:13.950
[Randall snarling]

33:15.326 --> 33:17.829
Jack! How long do you think
this is gonna take?

33:17.912 --> 33:20.999
Stop asking me that.
I don't know how long.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.209
But it's gonna be pretty awesome.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.169
No more pencils.

33:25.461 --> 33:26.587
No more books.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.756
And there's nothing Jack can do about it.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.178
There is nothing
he can do about it, right?

33:34.637 --> 33:35.471
Right.

33:39.475 --> 33:40.476
Even if he could...

33:41.602 --> 33:43.146
what's the worst that could happen?

33:43.521 --> 33:45.481
We'd have to take all our tests.

33:47.817 --> 33:50.194
[both sigh]

33:58.327 --> 33:59.495
I hate Jack Morton.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.915
Jack, it's been an hour!
The magic's got to be dead by now.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.333
Yeah. I think we're good.

34:06.461 --> 34:09.297
-[engine revs]
-[tires squeal]

34:10.465 --> 34:11.299
Or not.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.425
[engine revs]

34:13.718 --> 34:14.635
Oh, shit.

34:14.761 --> 34:16.262
[engine revs]

34:17.430 --> 34:19.932
Come on, Silverback. Come on, Silverback.
Come on, Silverback!

34:21.059 --> 34:22.477
[glass shattering]

34:23.394 --> 34:24.604
[Sliverback snarls]

34:26.522 --> 34:28.066
[man] It's outside.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.818
-[people gasping]
-[man 2] It was an accident.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.779
[man 3] An accident.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.031
[Benson gasps]

34:36.407 --> 34:38.618
I love you, Professor Benson!

34:39.118 --> 34:40.328
I love you!

34:41.537 --> 34:43.539
[Benson sighs]

34:46.125 --> 34:48.294
[Randall]
Doesn't have to be perfect, just booze.

34:48.961 --> 34:50.379
Seriously, Grandpa.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.381
[Hamish] Neanderthals.

34:56.052 --> 34:56.886
Jack.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.641
I kind of get
why we need these now.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.811
-It's hard work.
-It also used to be fun.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.688
Jack killed a car. That was fun.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.526
And you were right.
Eventually the magic petered out.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.277
It was a pretty long eventually.

35:13.736 --> 35:15.238
We saved ten people.

35:15.947 --> 35:16.864
Feels good.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.325
Saving people's okay, I guess.

35:20.993 --> 35:24.163
Nothing is going to change the fact
that I murdered a good man.

35:26.415 --> 35:29.168
You know, what do you do with all
the bad shit you have to carry around?

35:29.752 --> 35:30.753
You carry it.

35:32.463 --> 35:33.756
It's called being an adult.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.940
[Jack] Professor Clarke is dead.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.110
And it's all my fault.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.656
You've been practicing unsanctioned magic.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.117
I'll accept whatever punishment
you give me.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.370
If you wanna cancel my scholarship,
kick me out of school, or...

36:05.663 --> 36:07.415
[sighs] ...turn me over to the cops.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.794
Don't let it happen again, Jack.

36:13.754 --> 36:14.922
Wait, what?

36:15.381 --> 36:17.633
Well, we introduced you
to this amazing world.

36:17.717 --> 36:21.053
We'd be insane to think
you're not going to be... tempted.

36:21.762 --> 36:22.597
But I...

36:22.972 --> 36:24.348
I killed a man.

36:25.266 --> 36:29.145
And you should try to avoid doing that
in the future, okay?

36:29.228 --> 36:30.313
[drawer slides open]

36:32.106 --> 36:33.566
Did I say you could leave?

36:33.649 --> 36:34.775
[drawer slides shut]

36:37.737 --> 36:40.281
Killing your Ethics professor
is one thing.

36:40.823 --> 36:44.952
Harassing your English professor
is an entirely different issue.

36:46.746 --> 36:47.955
[sighs deeply]

36:51.542 --> 36:54.921
I hope you enjoy the sexual harassment
seminar you'll be attending.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.381
Off you go.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.680
[Jack]
I owe you an apology, Professor Clarke.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.142
Come to think of it, I owe you several.

37:08.684 --> 37:12.063
Starting with the fact that I have
to bury you in an unmarked grave.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.899
I’m also sorry
I missed your last lecture on...

37:15.149 --> 37:16.943
everything you need to know
about Ethics.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.613
And I'm really sorry I lied about...

37:21.072 --> 37:23.407
writing that paper
when I actually magicked it.

37:25.117 --> 37:28.120
And I’m... really sorry I killed you.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.582
But I think I learned a lot.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.377
I was given this awesome power

37:34.460 --> 37:37.338
and the first thing I did is get
everything I ever wanted.

37:38.673 --> 37:39.632
Not cool.

37:40.591 --> 37:41.717
Not ethical.

37:42.635 --> 37:43.511
[sighs]

37:44.845 --> 37:47.014
But I do promise you this,
Professor Clarke.

37:48.891 --> 37:50.309
Your death won't be in vain.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.026
How did you find me?

38:01.237 --> 38:02.405
[Lilith] Have you learned nothing?

38:02.989 --> 38:04.782
We smelled that corpse from a mile off.

38:05.741 --> 38:08.119
You're not thinking of eating
my Ethics professor?

38:08.202 --> 38:11.080
[chuckles] Relax. No one's gonna horn in
on your action.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.791
But... if you want to share--

38:13.874 --> 38:16.335
-No one is eating my Ethics professor!
-Guys, come on.

38:17.211 --> 38:18.087
Of course not.

38:19.505 --> 38:21.674
-But if you change your mind.
-We talked.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.802
We think your idea of an alliance
could still work.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.184
No.

38:33.227 --> 38:34.478
No alliance.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.987
I give my life to the cause.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.573
