WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:02.915
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.959 --> 00:05.831
-BELLAMY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
-CLARKE'S DEAD.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.007
JOSEPHINE?

00:07.050 --> 00:08.878
THIS BODY IS NOT
BIG ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US.

00:08.921 --> 00:11.272
REMEMBER WHEN PIKE
TAUGHT US MORSE CODE?

00:11.315 --> 00:12.969
IT MEANS CLARKE'S ALIVE.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.362
AND WE'RE GONNA GET
HER BACK.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.842
CLARKE'S ALIVE, BUT THE
BRAIN WE NOW SHARE IS DYING.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.670
FIND GABRIEL.
HE WAS ONE OF THEM,
BUT THEN HE BAILED.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.324
THIS IS A REALLY STUPID
PLAN, YOU KNOW?

00:20.368 --> 00:23.110
JOSEPHINE: THE CHILDREN OF
GABRIEL WILL KILL US BOTH.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.415
I SHOW THEM HOW TO MAKE
NIGHTBLOOD,

00:24.459 --> 00:26.243
THEY SAVE MARCUS.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.245
RAVEN: BY MURDERING THAT MAN
AND SHOVING KANE INTO HIS SKIN?

00:29.290 --> 00:31.118
-ABBY.
-MARCUS.

00:31.161 --> 00:32.858
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

00:32.902 --> 00:34.208
DIYOZA: I THOUGHT YOU SAID
RADIOS WERE NO GOOD HERE.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.166
GABRIEL: ALL SIGNALS GET
SUCKED UP BY THE ANOMALY.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.995
WE PICK THEM UP HERE IN
ENDLESS REPEATING WAVES.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.170
THE ANOMALY'S CALLING YOU.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.476
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.217
I JUST KNOW I HAVE
TO GO.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.088
OCTAVIA: IF YOU GO
IN THERE, YOU'LL DIE.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.872
DIYOZA, WAIT!

00:50.050 --> 00:51.877
GABRIEL: YOU'RE HEALED.

01:09.286 --> 01:11.941
GABRIEL:
WELCOME BACK.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.256
TELL ME WHAT YOU
REMEMBER.

01:22.299 --> 01:26.129
UM, NOTHING.

01:29.393 --> 01:30.612
NOTHING?

01:32.309 --> 01:35.530
NOTHING AT ALL?

01:35.573 --> 01:37.706
YOU FOLLOWED DIYOZA INTO
THE ANOMALY.

01:37.749 --> 01:40.317
COME ON. THINK.

01:40.361 --> 01:41.797
WHEN YOU CAME OUT,
YOU WERE RUNNING
FROM SOMETHING.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.059
WHAT WAS IT?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.453
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.672
I'VE BEEN WAITING
150 YEARS.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.766
MAYBE YOU NEED
A LITTLE HELP.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.144
WHAT IS THAT?

02:24.187 --> 02:27.190
RED SUN TOXIN, HIGHLY
CONCENTRATED. STAY BACK.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.279
THAT'S THE SAME STUFF
WE SAW IN THE AIR

02:29.323 --> 02:31.020
ON THE WAY TO THE ANOMALY.

02:31.063 --> 02:34.154
GOOD. YOU WERE PAYING
ATTENTION.

02:34.197 --> 02:37.200
THIS WILL BE MUCH
MORE INTENSE THAN THAT.

02:37.244 --> 02:40.725
IT'S AMAZING STUFF,
REALLY.

02:40.769 --> 02:41.770
PRODUCED DEEP
IN THE GROUND.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.989
IT'S GIVEN OFF
BY TREES.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.253
IT DRIVES EVERY
LIVING CREATURE
IN SANCTUM MAD.

02:46.296 --> 02:49.778
THEY KILL THEMSELVES,
AND THE MOON FEEDS
ON THEIR CORPSES. HEH.

02:49.821 --> 02:52.302
JOSEPHINE THEORIZED
THAT'S WHY LIFE HERE

02:52.346 --> 02:54.174
NEVER EVOLVED PAST
REPTILE PHASE.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.306
HUMANS WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO COME,

02:56.350 --> 02:57.394
BUT WE DID.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.701
AND AS WE DO, WE
MADE IMPROVEMENTS.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.050
TRUST ME, THIS WILL
HELP YOU REMEMBER.

03:01.093 --> 03:03.879
WHAT IF THERE'S NOTHING
TO REMEMBER?

03:03.922 --> 03:06.011
I WAS ONLY GONE
FOR A FEW SECONDS.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.796
RIGHT. AND YET YOU
CAME BACK HEALED.

03:07.839 --> 03:09.798
YOUR HAIR IS CLEAN,
OCTAVIA,

03:09.841 --> 03:11.452
MAYBE EVEN LONGER.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.105
YOU WERE RUNNING TOWARD
ME INSTEAD OF AWAY

03:13.149 --> 03:14.803
AS IF--I DON'T KNOW--

03:14.846 --> 03:17.545
SOMEONE OR SOMETHING WAS
CHASING YOU.

03:17.588 --> 03:20.243
LOOK, LISTEN TO ME,
UNTIL TONIGHT,

03:20.287 --> 03:22.332
NO ONE HAS EVER COME
OUT OF THE ANOMALY, OK?

03:22.376 --> 03:23.855
NO ONE.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.161
NOW, I BELIEVE YOU WERE
GONE FOR MUCH LONGER

03:25.205 --> 03:26.728
THAN JUST A FEW SECONDS

03:26.771 --> 03:28.991
AND THAT YOU CAME BACK
FOR A REASON.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.514
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE
YOU WENT

03:30.558 --> 03:32.603
AND WHY YOU RETURNED.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.431
WHY DON'T YOU?

03:37.652 --> 03:39.088
HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS?

03:39.131 --> 03:41.133
A LONG, LONG TIME AGO.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.744
RUSSELL AND I USED IT
TO FIND OUT

03:42.787 --> 03:46.400
WHETHER ANY TRACE OF
A HOST'S MIND REMAINED
AFTER RESURRECTION.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.923
THE ANSWER WAS NO.

03:47.966 --> 03:51.056
INSTEAD, IT UNLOCKED
PARTS OF OUR OWN MINDS,

03:51.100 --> 03:52.841
THINGS WE'D HIDDEN
FROM OURSELVES,

03:52.884 --> 03:55.409
ANSWERS TO WHAT OUR
GREATER PURPOSE WAS.

03:55.452 --> 03:58.063
HIS WAS TO TURN US
INTO GODS.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.370
MINE WAS TO MAKE SURE
THAT HE COULDN'T.

04:00.414 --> 04:03.373
WHAT'S MINE?

04:03.417 --> 04:06.637
MAYBE WE'LL FIND THAT
OUT, TOO.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.857
COME ON.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.296
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.646
I'LL BE MONITORING
YOU THE WHOLE TIME,

04:15.690 --> 04:17.039
ACTING AS
YOUR GUIDE,

04:17.082 --> 04:19.259
WHAT WE CALL
AN ADJUSTER.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.306
ONCE YOU'RE UNDER,

04:23.350 --> 04:27.179
YOU'LL WANT TO FOLLOW
SIGNS OF THE ANOMALY.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.572
SIGNS?

04:28.616 --> 04:30.879
WHAT SIGNS?

04:35.405 --> 04:37.102
GABRIEL?

04:39.148 --> 04:41.106
OCTAVIA.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.152
NOW THAT'S A SIGN.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.476
RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.739
OCTAVIA...

05:45.562 --> 05:48.348
MAN: YEAH!

05:51.351 --> 05:57.531
BLODREINA: YOU ARE WONKRU, OR
YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF WONKRU.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.366
OCTAVIA!

06:15.157 --> 06:16.898
WHAT IS THIS?

06:16.941 --> 06:19.509
NO!

06:21.903 --> 06:25.036
LET ME GO!

06:29.563 --> 06:31.913
HYAH!

06:31.956 --> 06:34.916
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

07:18.307 --> 07:21.919
I KNEW YOU'D
COME BACK TO ME.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.660
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

07:23.704 --> 07:26.054
AMAZING.

07:32.713 --> 07:35.106
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:35.150 --> 07:37.500
I REMEMBER
VINSON'S BITE.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.635
YOU DON'T EVER HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT AGAIN.

07:44.681 --> 07:47.554
CRUCIFIXION SCARS.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.774
COALITION BRAND.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.864
MARKS OF A PAINFUL PAST

07:53.908 --> 07:55.649
NOW GONE.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.520
GONE?

07:57.564 --> 07:59.522
I MEAN, THEY...

07:59.566 --> 08:01.698
THEY WERE A PART OF ME.

08:07.704 --> 08:10.881
WHO WAS THIS MAN?

08:10.925 --> 08:13.580
MARCUS, THIS IS
A GIFT,

08:13.623 --> 08:15.756
FOR EVERYTHING THAT
YOU GAVE TO US,

08:15.799 --> 08:18.236
FOR EVERYTHING
YOU GAVE TO ME.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.891
I COULDN'T LET YOU DIE
BECAUSE OF MY MISTAKES.

08:20.935 --> 08:25.548
PLEASE, PLEASE
ACCEPT THIS.

08:27.289 --> 08:30.597
EVERYTHING THAT
MADE ME WHO I AM.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.687
IT'S STILL IN THERE...

08:34.992 --> 08:37.560
THE MAN I FELL
IN LOVE WITH,

08:37.604 --> 08:40.737
THE MAN WHO RISKED
HIS LIFE FOR HIS PEOPLE

08:40.781 --> 08:43.131
TIME AND TIME AGAIN

08:43.174 --> 08:46.264
THE MAN WHO FOUND
REDEMPTION FOR HIS SINS

08:46.308 --> 08:48.745
AND GAVE ALL OF US HOPE

08:48.789 --> 08:52.009
THAT WE WOULD FIND
REDEMPTION, TOO.

08:54.838 --> 08:57.145
THAT'S WHO YOU ARE.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.759
THIS DOESN'T
CHANGE THAT.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.329
I WANT TO BELIEVE
THAT'S TRUE, REALLY.

09:07.372 --> 09:11.246
WELL, THEN,
BELIEVE IN US.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.397
WHAT IS IT?

09:33.877 --> 09:35.662
YOU TASTE DIFFERENT...

09:39.840 --> 09:42.190
FEEL DIFFERENT.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.586
EVERYTHING'S WRONG.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.737
IT'S OK.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.831
YOU JUST NEED SOME TIME.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.790
THINGS WILL BE
DIFFERENT ON THE GROUND,

10:16.833 --> 10:18.269
IN SANCTUM.

10:18.313 --> 10:21.708
WE'LL FINALLY HAVE
OUR CHANCE AT PEACE.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.326
BELLAMY: STOP FIGHTING.

10:31.369 --> 10:34.721
DON'T YOU GET IT,
YOU'RE KILLING ALL 3 OF US.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.592
NOT TO MENTION THE REST
OF YOUR FRIENDS

10:36.636 --> 10:38.681
WHEN MY FATHER FINDS OUT.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.901
IS CLARKE REALLY WORTH
ALL OF THAT?

10:57.352 --> 10:59.484
IT'S GETTING WORSE.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.443
YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME HOME.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.925
IF I TAKE YOU HOME,
YOU'LL USE AN EMP
AND KILL CLARKE.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.710
I TOLD YOU I WON'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.713
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL
WON'T HELP YOU.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.454
WHEN THEY FIND OUT
WHO I AM,

11:12.497 --> 11:14.717
THEY WON'T JUST DESTROY
MY MIND DRIVE,

11:14.761 --> 11:18.416
THEY'LL CUT OFF MY HEAD,
AND YOU'LL HAVE NOTHING.

11:24.596 --> 11:27.425
WELL, LET'S MAKE SURE

11:27.469 --> 11:30.907
THEY DON'T FIND OUT.

11:30.951 --> 11:33.127
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY TAUGHT YOU

11:33.170 --> 11:34.955
ON THAT HUNK OF METAL
YOU GREW UP IN,

11:34.998 --> 11:37.827
BUT WHERE I'M FROM,
WHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU
YOU'RE IN DANGER,

11:37.871 --> 11:39.916
YOU LISTEN.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.788
YEAH, WE DO THAT, TOO,

11:41.831 --> 11:44.181
UNLESS THE PEOPLE
WE CARE ABOUT
ARE IN TROUBLE,

11:44.225 --> 11:45.835
THEN WE DO WHAT
HAS TO BE DONE.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.750
NOW, COME ON.
LET'S GO.

11:47.794 --> 11:51.493
THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT
ARE IN TROUBLE.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.800
I GUESS YOU JUST CARE
ABOUT HER MORE.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.019
QUIET.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.978
YOU'RE IN OUR WOODS!

11:58.021 --> 11:59.153
A LONG WAY FROM HOME.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.415
BELLAMY: IT'S OK.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.416
I NEED TO SEE GABRIEL.

12:01.459 --> 12:02.722
ON THE GROUND!

12:02.765 --> 12:04.201
HE NEEDS TO KNOW
WHAT WE KNOW.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.768
GOD, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.204
MAN: HANDS UP!

12:19.956 --> 12:23.525
EW. WHAT IS
THAT SMELL?

12:23.568 --> 12:25.005
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS GABRIEL?

12:25.048 --> 12:27.355
WE HAVE INFORMATION
CRITICAL TO YOUR CAUSE.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.226
THEIR CAUSE IS
A JOKE.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.706
QUIET!

12:30.750 --> 12:33.883
WHAT DID THESE PEOPLE
EVER DO TO YOU, HMM?

12:33.927 --> 12:35.145
LET ME GUESS,

12:35.189 --> 12:36.799
THEY REFUSED REEDUCATION?

12:36.843 --> 12:37.757
BE QUIET.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.932
DOES THEIR FAITH
IN THE CRIMES

12:38.975 --> 12:41.543
REALLY THREATEN
YOU THAT MUCH?

12:41.586 --> 12:43.545
DO YOU THINK THAT
DRESSING UP IN
SCARY COSTUMES

12:43.588 --> 12:45.634
HELPS YOUR CAUSE?

12:45.677 --> 12:47.810
WE LAUGH AT YOU
IN SANCTUM.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.336
WHY AREN'T YOU
LAUGHING NOW?

12:52.380 --> 12:54.774
JUST WAIT.
THEY CAN MAKE HOSTS.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.996
AS MANY AS THEY WANT.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.174
DETAILS,

13:04.218 --> 13:05.872
OR YOUR RUDE
FRIEND DIES.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.222
BELLAMY:
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:08.265 --> 13:11.268
TOUCH HER, I'LL
TELL YOU NOTHING.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.009
SOMETHING TELLS ME
WE COULD MAKE YOU TALK.

13:13.053 --> 13:16.534
MAYBE, BUT BY THEN,
THE 12 PRIMES COULD
BE BACK.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.841
GABRIEL GETS THE DETAILS.
NO ONE ELSE.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.016
THERE WERE 13.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.757
CHAIN THEM UP.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.978
IF THE OLD MAN
DOESN'T RESPOND,

13:25.021 --> 13:27.197
YOU DIE LIKE HIM.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.285
MAN: LET'S GO.

13:28.329 --> 13:29.852
RADIOS.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.685
MAN: JERICHO TO PROVIDENCE.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.252
WE HAVE A PRISONER
THAT CLAIMS PRIMES

13:38.295 --> 13:40.167
CAN NOW MAKE HOSTS.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.734
IF YOU'RE OUT THERE...

13:42.778 --> 13:44.954
RADIOS DON'T WORK
ON THIS MOON.

13:44.998 --> 13:46.477
HOW COULD THEY
NOT KNOW THAT?

13:46.521 --> 13:50.481
THEY WORK IN ONE PLACE.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.874
WHAT IS IT?

13:51.918 --> 13:54.616
IF THEY'RE CALLING HIM,

13:54.659 --> 13:57.619
THAT MEANS HE'S ALIVE.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.970
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH YOU TWO?

14:01.014 --> 14:04.365
WHAT? ARE WE GONNA
BE FRIENDS NOW?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.889
DOUBTFUL.

14:09.587 --> 14:12.895
I'VE BEEN IN LOVE
WITH GABRIEL FOR 236 YEARS,

14:12.939 --> 14:15.767
THE LAST 70 OF WHICH HE'S
BEEN TRYING TO KILL ME.

14:15.811 --> 14:20.424
YOU KNOW, RELATIONSHIPS.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.913
MORSE CODE, HUH?

14:30.957 --> 14:33.873
SHE'S CRAFTY,
I'LL GIVE HER THAT.

14:33.916 --> 14:38.094
B-O-O...

14:38.138 --> 14:42.055
H-O-O.

14:43.491 --> 14:45.101
THAT'S HARSH.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.495
SHE CAN HEAR US?

14:47.538 --> 14:49.410
IT WOULD SEEM SO.

14:49.453 --> 14:52.195
WHICH MEANS THE WALL
SEPARATING OUR MINDS

14:52.239 --> 14:53.501
IS ALMOST GONE.

14:53.544 --> 14:54.937
WHEN THAT HAPPENS,

14:54.981 --> 14:57.635
SHE'LL STROKE OUT,
I'LL DOWNLOAD,

14:57.679 --> 15:00.116
AND YOU CAN SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR GENOCIDAL FRIEND.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.378
LET ME TALK TO HER.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.946
I'D HAVE TO GIVE OVER
CONTROL FOR THAT, SO NO.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.643
BUT SHE CAN HEAR ME?

15:05.687 --> 15:08.081
YES, SHE CAN HEAR YOU.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.869
FOR GOD'S SAKE, JUST SAY
WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.572
I WON'T LET YOU DIE.

15:40.069 --> 15:42.463
MMM.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.487
WAS IT WORTH IT?

16:08.445 --> 16:12.014
RAVEN, YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.278
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

16:15.322 --> 16:18.064
WHY DON'T WE ASK HIM?

16:21.154 --> 16:22.285
RAVEN.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.244
KANE, ARE YOU OK
WITH THIS?

16:29.292 --> 16:31.164
ABBY.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.079
GOOD, YOU'RE ALL HERE.

16:34.384 --> 16:37.474
MARCUS.

16:37.518 --> 16:40.216
ABBY: THIS IS ONE OF
THE LEADERS OF SANCTUM.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.176
SIMONE LIGHTBOURNE.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.351
HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

16:44.394 --> 16:45.787
ALL: HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.093
SIMONE: IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

16:47.136 --> 16:50.183
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M ANXIOUS TO GET HOME.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.532
YOU UNDERSTAND.

16:51.575 --> 16:54.187
YOU KNEW HIM.

16:56.406 --> 16:59.844
SIERRA,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.629
YES.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.761
GAVIN WAS MY HUSBAND.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.983
PLEASE TELL HIM
THAT I'M OVERJOYED
HE COULD HELP YOU

17:08.027 --> 17:11.073
AND BECOME ONE WITH
THE PRIMES.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.728
THANK YOU, SIERRA.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.730
PLEASE MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING'S PACKED.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.605
YOU LIED TO THEM.

17:21.649 --> 17:22.824
HE'S NOT ONE
WITH THE PRIMES.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.653
THAT'S ENOUGH.
WE'RE LEAVING.

17:25.696 --> 17:27.133
I'M SURE YOU'RE
LOOKING FORWARD

17:27.176 --> 17:28.438
TO EXPLORING
YOUR NEW WORLD.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.005
YOU DON'T WANT THEM
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.876
-MARCUS, PLEASE.
-IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.489
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERN,

17:35.532 --> 17:37.186
AND THIS MAY COME
AS A SURPRISE TO YOU,

17:37.230 --> 17:39.101
BUT GAVIN WANTED THIS
MORE THAN HE WANTED

17:39.145 --> 17:40.320
ANYTHING IN
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

17:40.363 --> 17:41.886
PLEASE.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.019
THOUGH I MAY LOOK LIKE HIM,

17:44.063 --> 17:46.152
I AM NOT ONE OF
THE SHEEP YOU RAISED

17:46.195 --> 17:48.067
TO FOLLOW YOU
INTO OBLIVION.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.940
MARCUS, PLEASE.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.904
I'M NOT SURE IT WAS
WORTH IT TO HIM.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.127
I'M SORRY.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.824
THERE'S ALWAYS
A PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT

18:06.868 --> 18:09.000
IN A NEW BODY, ESPECIALLY
THE FIRST TIME.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.263
IF YOU LIKE, I CAN HAVE
ONE OF MY GUARDS

18:10.306 --> 18:11.264
ESCORT HIM
ONTO THE SHIP.

18:11.307 --> 18:12.743
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY,

18:12.787 --> 18:13.788
BUT THANK YOU.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.920
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.705
HE'LL GET USED TO IT.

18:17.748 --> 18:20.316
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.380
RAVEN: WELCOME BACK.

18:40.423 --> 18:43.078
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.212
INDRA: WE?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.566
INDRA, MEET MARCUS KANE,

18:52.609 --> 18:54.307
THE SECOND.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.526
HELLO, MY FRIEND.

19:22.073 --> 19:25.599
GABRIEL:
ABOUT TIME. HERE WE GO.
GOOD LUCK.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.922
OCTAVIA: WHAT DO YOU WANT?

19:44.966 --> 19:47.273
LEAVE ME ALONE!

19:49.753 --> 19:52.756
I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T DO THAT.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.020
WE'VE GOT UNFINISHED
BUSINESS, YOU AND I.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.242
WRONG, PIKE.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.941
YOU KILLED LINCOLN,
AND YOU DIED FOR IT.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.422
END OF STORY.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.685
WAS IT?

20:08.729 --> 20:11.427
YOU THINK MURDERING
SOMEONE IN COLD BLOOD,

20:11.471 --> 20:13.777
EVEN SOMEONE YOU HAVE
REASON TO HATE,

20:13.821 --> 20:15.518
IS JUSTIFIABLE?

20:15.562 --> 20:18.956
YES.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.569
AND YET IT TURNED
YOU INTO THIS.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.571
THINK WHAT YOU WANT,

20:24.614 --> 20:26.486
I'M NOT HERE FOR YOU.

20:26.529 --> 20:27.443
PIKE: NO.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.402
YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE OF ME.

20:29.445 --> 20:32.709
THE PATH TO THE FUTURE
GOES THROUGH THE PAST,
MISS BLAKE.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.363
PSYCHOLOGY 101.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.191
WE ARE WHAT WE'VE DONE

20:36.235 --> 20:38.976
AND WHAT'S BEEN
DONE TO US.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.022
NOW, YOU'VE HAD
A ROUGH GO, I'LL
GIVE YOU THAT.

20:41.065 --> 20:44.025
AND IT'S MADE YOUR
DARK SIDE STRONG.

20:45.374 --> 20:48.290
I SUPPOSE YOU NEEDED THAT
TO PROTECT YOURSELF

20:48.334 --> 20:50.292
UNDER THE FLOOR.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.427
BUT WHAT ABOUT NOW?

20:54.470 --> 20:57.343
WHO ARE YOU NOW?

20:57.386 --> 20:59.301
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
OCTAVIA?

20:59.345 --> 21:00.302
I WANT YOU GONE.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.912
YOU TRIED THAT.
DIDN'T TAKE.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.479
IT HAS TO BE
SOMETHING ELSE.

21:03.523 --> 21:06.917
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED INSIDE THE ANOMALY.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.484
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.181
MAYBE NOTHING HAPPENED,

21:10.225 --> 21:12.836
OR MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO KNOW.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.621
THEY DON'T CALL IT
THE ANOMALY FOR NOTHING.

21:14.664 --> 21:17.493
WHAT I KNOW IS YOU
CHOSE THE RED BOX,

21:17.537 --> 21:19.147
SO STOP WASTING MY TIME

21:19.190 --> 21:20.801
AND ANSWER MY DAMN QUESTION.

21:20.844 --> 21:23.064
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:24.413 --> 21:26.023
OK.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.635
BECAUSE CLASS IS
IN SESSION,

21:28.678 --> 21:32.247
ALLOW ME TO FACILITATE
THE DISCUSSION.

21:34.380 --> 21:38.558
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO KNOW THAT...

21:38.601 --> 21:40.342
EVERYONE HATES YOU,

21:40.386 --> 21:44.781
EVERYONE YOU CARE ABOUT,

21:44.825 --> 21:47.349
EVEN YOUR BROTHER?

21:49.830 --> 21:51.571
NOT GOOD.

21:51.614 --> 21:54.095
OH, I EXPECT NOT.

21:55.879 --> 21:58.404
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE WORST PART, IS IT?

22:03.278 --> 22:06.150
YOU HATE YOURSELF, TOO.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.070
GOOD.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.072
ONE MORE TIME.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.554
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:20.556 --> 22:23.907
FORGIVENESS.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.040
DEEPER.

22:26.083 --> 22:29.391
MUCH, MUCH DEEPER.

22:31.741 --> 22:36.485
FORGIVENESS IS FOR
MINOR OFFENSES.

22:36.529 --> 22:39.488
YOU MURDERED PEOPLE

22:39.532 --> 22:43.623
TO GET THEM TO EAT THEIR
FRIENDS AND FAMILIES.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.016
AND THEN YOU
BURNED THE FARM

22:46.060 --> 22:47.409
TO GET THEM TO MARCH

22:47.453 --> 22:49.324
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T LIVE
WITH THE IDEA

22:49.368 --> 22:51.326
OF NOT GETTING
TO THAT VALLEY,

22:51.370 --> 22:53.284
EVEN WHEN THERE
WAS ANOTHER WAY.

22:53.328 --> 22:57.637
YOU GOT 400 PEOPLE
KILLED IN THAT GORGE.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.641
YOU CAUSED THE WORLD
TO BE DESTROYED.

23:01.684 --> 23:05.514
WHAT YOU WANT NEEDS
TO BE EARNED.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.516
NOW SAY IT!

23:07.560 --> 23:08.474
REDEMPTION.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.824
WHAT'S THAT?
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.739
REDEMPTION!

23:12.782 --> 23:14.610
DING DING DING!

23:14.654 --> 23:16.569
A GOLD STAR FOR
MISS BLAKE.

23:16.612 --> 23:19.354
I WAS TRYING
TO EARN MINE

23:19.398 --> 23:21.269
WHEN YOU PUT
A SWORD THROUGH ME.

23:21.312 --> 23:26.622
WHICH BRINGS US TO BIG
QUESTION NUMBER TWO--

23:26.666 --> 23:30.539
WHAT ARE YOU WILLING
TO DO TO GET IT?

23:30.583 --> 23:32.715
WHAT IF I DON'T DESERVE IT?

23:32.759 --> 23:34.674
DESERVE'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

23:34.717 --> 23:36.502
BLODREINA:
SHUT UP, PIKE.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.870
PICK UP THE SWORD
AND STRIKE HIM DOWN.

23:56.913 --> 23:59.916
DO WHAT YOU KNOW
HAS TO BE DONE.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.527
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

24:01.570 --> 24:05.487
DOING THE SAME THING
AND EXPECTING A
DIFFERENT RESULT

24:05.531 --> 24:08.098
IS THE DEFINITION
OF INSANITY.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.622
EINSTEIN SAID THAT.

24:09.665 --> 24:13.843
AND I SAY YOU ARE WONKRU
OR YOU ARE THE ENEMY

24:13.887 --> 24:15.497
OF WONKRU.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.977
OOH!

24:19.066 --> 24:20.633
PIKE: I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN.

24:20.676 --> 24:22.983
WHO ARE YOU NOW,
MISS BLAKE--

24:23.026 --> 24:24.724
YOUR BROTHER'S SISTER

24:24.767 --> 24:27.030
OR THE MONSTER
WHO WOULD HAVE
WATCHED HIM DIE

24:27.074 --> 24:28.510
IN THIS VERY ARENA?

24:28.554 --> 24:29.859
I'M NOT AFRAID.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.731
YES, YOU ARE.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.777
GOD, YOU'RE PATHETIC.

24:34.821 --> 24:37.258
I GUESS SHE NEEDS
ME AFTER ALL.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.303
OCTAVIA: I'M NOT AFRAID.

24:39.347 --> 24:45.266
CHARLES PIKE OF FARM STATION,

24:45.309 --> 24:46.702
YOU HAVE BEEN
SENTENCED TO DEATH

24:46.746 --> 24:48.835
IN ACCORDANCE TO
THE LAWS OF WONKRU.

24:48.878 --> 24:50.489
PIKE: YOU HAVE BEEN
SENTENCED TO DEATH

24:50.532 --> 24:53.622
IN ACCORDANCE TO
THE EXODUS CHARTER.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.450
ANY LAST WORDS?

24:55.494 --> 24:57.496
NOT FOR YOU.NOT FOR YOU.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.516
UHH!

25:20.910 --> 25:23.565
BLODREINA: BAD CHOICE.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.966
CONGRATULATIONS.

25:33.009 --> 25:35.534
YOU DIE INSTEAD.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.418
UHH!

26:01.777 --> 26:04.650
UHH!

26:45.429 --> 26:47.257
RAVEN: I DIDN'T KNOW
UNTIL WE GOT HERE,

26:47.301 --> 26:48.737
OR I WOULDN'T HAVE
FLOWN THE SHIP.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.522
THE DEAL WAS ABBY SHOWS
THEM HOW TO MAKE NIGHTBLOOD

26:51.566 --> 26:52.828
AND SIMONE BRINGS YOU BACK.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.090
I TRIED TO TALK
HER OUT OF IT.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.701
NOT HARD ENOUGH.

26:55.744 --> 26:59.400
WHY IS MY LIFE WORTH
MORE THAN THIS MAN'S?

26:59.443 --> 27:01.271
BECAUSE SHE LOVES YOU.

27:01.315 --> 27:04.579
INDRA, YOU CAN'T
BE OK WITH THIS.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.928
WHY NOT?

27:05.972 --> 27:09.410
ON THE ARK, YOU FLOATED
PEOPLE FOR STEALING FOOD.

27:09.453 --> 27:11.499
ON THE GROUND,
MY PEOPLE CHEERED

27:11.542 --> 27:14.850
AS CHILDREN FOUGHT
TO THE DEATH TO LEAD US.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.678
IS THIS SO MUCH WORSE?

27:16.722 --> 27:19.115
SO BECAUSE WE'VE
ALL DONE AWFUL THINGS,

27:19.159 --> 27:20.334
WE DO NOTHING?

27:20.377 --> 27:21.770
NO, WE SURVIVE.

27:21.814 --> 27:24.338
RAVEN SAYS THEY'RE
HELPING US DOWN THERE.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.514
I ASSUME WE NEED
THE HELP.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.212
LOOK AT ME.

27:29.256 --> 27:30.692
THIS MAN HAD A LIFE.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.868
THERE'S A WOMAN
WITH HIM, HIS WIFE.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.522
SHE BELIEVES HE'S
STILL INSIDE ME.

27:34.565 --> 27:36.350
THEY LIE TO THEM,
LET THEM THINK
THEY'RE GODS.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.961
THEY LIVE FOREVER.
IS THAT NOT GODLIKE?

27:39.005 --> 27:41.311
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, INDRA?

27:41.355 --> 27:42.791
YOU BELIEVE THEM?

27:42.835 --> 27:44.140
WHO CARES WHAT
I BELIEVE?

27:44.184 --> 27:47.187
WHAT I KNOW IS THAT
I AM LOOKING AT

27:47.230 --> 27:49.929
MY ONCE CRUCIFIED,
RESURRECTED FRIEND,

27:49.972 --> 27:53.541
AND I CAN SEE WHY SOME
MIGHT THINK THAT'S A MIRACLE.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.718
INDRA, THEY'RE
MURDERING PEOPLE.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.851
THEY GO WILLINGLY
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
KNOW THE TRUTH.

27:58.894 --> 28:02.463
YES, LIVES HAVE BEEN
LOST IN THE WORSHIPPING
OF FALSE GODS BEFORE,

28:02.506 --> 28:04.030
MORE THAN CAN
BE COUNTED.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.901
BUT IF WE LET IT STAND

28:05.945 --> 28:07.686
WHEN WE COULD STOP IT,

28:07.729 --> 28:09.426
THEN OUR NEW WORLD
WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT

28:09.470 --> 28:12.516
THAN THE ONE
WE LEFT BEHIND.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.823
THIS IS WHY WE
NEED YOU, KANE.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.260
NONSENSE.

28:17.304 --> 28:18.871
RAVEN, YOU'RE STRONG.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.394
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
WHAT'S RIGHT.

28:20.437 --> 28:21.917
THEN WHY DID I HELP ABBY?

28:21.961 --> 28:23.527
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

28:23.571 --> 28:26.792
THE QUESTION HERE IS,
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

28:28.054 --> 28:29.838
DESTROY
THE NIGHTBLOOD SERUM.

28:31.231 --> 28:32.885
THEY WOULD JUST
MAKE MORE.

28:32.928 --> 28:34.234
NOT IF WE FLOAT IT.

28:34.277 --> 28:36.758
ABBY USED ALL THE
AVAILABLE POLYMER
ON THE SHIP.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.281
THEY MIGHT FIND SOME
MORE ON THE GROUND,

28:38.325 --> 28:39.718
BUT UNLESS THEY
HAVE A PILOT,

28:39.761 --> 28:41.850
THEY'RE NOT GETTING
BACK TO ZERO-G.

28:43.983 --> 28:45.898
AND IF THEY DO,

28:45.941 --> 28:49.640
THEY'LL HAVE TO GET
PAST ME.

28:50.859 --> 28:52.513
HEH.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.658
WHAT?

29:08.877 --> 29:10.400
MY FATHER WAS A FOOL

29:10.444 --> 29:12.098
FOR LETTING
YOU PEOPLE STAY.

29:12.141 --> 29:17.494
ALL THAT TIME SPENT
BUILDING A SANCTUARY
FOR THE HUMAN RACE,

29:17.538 --> 29:19.496
AND HE DESTROYS IT

29:19.540 --> 29:22.630
BECAUSE OF THE MOST
HUMAN THING OF ALL--

29:22.673 --> 29:24.675
LOVE.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.115
I MEAN, WHO CAN
BLAME HIM?

29:29.158 --> 29:31.900
I AM AWESOME.
IT'S JUST...

29:31.944 --> 29:33.510
WELL, AND LOOK AT YOU.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.164
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
HOW THIS WOULD END.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.863
GUESS I'M JUST SAYING
ALL THIS BECAUSE

29:37.906 --> 29:39.908
I KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU NOW.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.084
HMM, YOU DO, HUH?

29:42.128 --> 29:43.782
MM-HMM.

29:43.825 --> 29:47.437
TAKE YOU AND CLARKE,
FOR INSTANCE.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.875
NOW THAT'S A WEIRD
RELATIONSHIP, ISN'T IT?

29:49.918 --> 29:53.835
FIRST YOU WANT TO KILL HER
TO SAVE YOUR OWN ASS,

29:53.879 --> 29:57.186
EVEN THOUGH IT MEANS
THE GENOCIDE OF YOUR
OWN PEOPLE ON THE ARK,

29:57.230 --> 30:00.059
AND THEN YOU
BECOME BESTIES,

30:00.102 --> 30:03.192
BONDING OVER THE ACTUAL
GENOCIDE AT MOUNT WEATHER.

30:03.236 --> 30:05.716
TOGETHER.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.023
YOU LOCK HER UP,
SHE LOCKS YOU UP,

30:08.067 --> 30:10.547
YOU LEAVE HER ON EARTH,
SHE LEAVES YOU TO DIE

30:10.591 --> 30:11.722
IN THE FIGHTING PITS.

30:11.766 --> 30:14.856
I MEAN, IT'S EXHAUSTING,
FRANKLY.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.031
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

30:18.555 --> 30:21.776
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT HOW
THIS ENDS, BY THE WAY.

30:21.820 --> 30:26.041
MMM. FIRST, WE GET BACK
INTO YOUR MIND DRIVE,

30:26.085 --> 30:30.263
AND THEN I'LL USE IT
FOR A PEACE DEAL
WITH YOUR FATHER.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.918
YOUR BELIEF
IN YOURSELF IS CUTE.

30:32.961 --> 30:37.618
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
PUTTING ASIDE ABOUT
A THOUSAND VARIABLES,

30:37.661 --> 30:41.578
CHIEF AMONG THEM CLARKE'S
NEWFOUND EVANGELICAL,

30:41.622 --> 30:44.625
DUE BETTER-ISM, MAKING IT
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO ACCEPT

30:44.668 --> 30:47.497
A PEACE DEAL WITH
THOSE AWFUL BODY SNATCHERS,

30:47.541 --> 30:49.673
ALL 3 OF US ARE
GONNA DIE IN THIS CAVE.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.806
YEAH, OK.
WE'LL SEE.

30:51.850 --> 30:56.071
OK, NOW YOUR CONFIDENCE
IS JUST PISSING ME OFF.

31:01.468 --> 31:02.904
GAG THE PRISONERS.

31:07.039 --> 31:10.912
EVERYBODY UP!
THE SANCTUM RIDERS ARE COMING.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.872
GET AWAY FROM ME.

31:15.525 --> 31:16.875
STAND HER UP.

31:21.662 --> 31:23.316
SHE'S GOT THE BLOOD.

31:23.359 --> 31:25.622
SHE'S GOT THE BLOOD!

31:28.582 --> 31:30.627
PUT HER ON HER KNEES.

31:30.671 --> 31:33.021
LEAVE HER ALONE!

31:36.416 --> 31:38.897
SHE'S A PRIME.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.858
UNCHAIN HER.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.121
PUT HER THERE.

31:46.165 --> 31:47.644
DON'T DO THIS, PLEASE.

31:47.688 --> 31:50.038
THE DRIVE IN HER HEAD,
IT'S JOSEPHINE.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.518
UHH!

31:51.561 --> 31:53.215
NOT HELPING.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.000
THINK! AS LONG AS
SHE'S ALIVE,

31:55.043 --> 31:56.610
YOU HAVE LEVERAGE
OVER RUSSELL.

31:56.653 --> 31:59.091
MAN: THIS IS NOT
A NEGOTIATION, IT'S A WAR.

31:59.134 --> 32:02.137
THE ANSWER IS
DEATH TO PRIMES.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.530
WAIT!

32:03.573 --> 32:05.836
GABRIEL LOVES HER.

32:05.880 --> 32:06.968
IS THIS WHAT
HE WOULD WANT?

32:07.012 --> 32:08.404
DON'T YOU USE HIS NAME.

32:08.448 --> 32:11.016
UHH!

32:21.417 --> 32:22.505
CLARKE.

32:22.549 --> 32:23.506
YEAH.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.073
SHE GAVE YOU CONTROL?

32:25.117 --> 32:27.380
IT WAS EITHER THAT
OR GET HER HEAD CUT OFF.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.425
MAN: I HEARD
SOMETHING!

32:31.340 --> 32:32.385
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

32:32.428 --> 32:33.560
YOU'VE GOT TO RUN.

32:33.603 --> 32:34.735
NO, I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.

32:34.778 --> 32:38.565
GO FIND GABRIEL. GO! NOW!

32:39.740 --> 32:41.307
LEADER: IT'S
JOSEPHINE PRIME.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.613
KILL HER BEFORE
SHE GETS TO THE RISE.

32:43.657 --> 32:48.096
DO NOT LET THEM
GET HER BACK. GO!

33:17.821 --> 33:20.085
HERE! I'M HERE!

33:28.354 --> 33:30.573
GUN! DOWN!

33:30.617 --> 33:32.706
JADE: DON'T SHOOT.
YOU'LL HIT JOSEPHINE.

33:32.749 --> 33:34.142
DOWN! GET DOWN!

33:38.494 --> 33:40.714
I GOT HER,
YOU GET THE REST.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.502
THANK GOD YOU'RE OK.

33:46.546 --> 33:50.289
COME ON, LET'S GET
YOU HOME.

33:50.332 --> 33:53.074
UHH!

33:53.118 --> 33:55.859
REALLY?

33:55.903 --> 33:57.600
SHE JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE.

33:57.644 --> 34:00.560
WHY CAN I SEE YOU?

34:00.603 --> 34:01.735
BECAUSE IT'S
GETTING WORSE,

34:01.778 --> 34:04.085
LIKE I SAID IT WOULD.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.000
LOOK, WHAT YOU DID
BACK THERE WAS AWESOME.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.349
DON'T LET IT BE
FOR NOTHING.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.090
GIVE ME BACK CONTROL.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.223
I'LL JUST GET IT ANYWAY
WHEN YOU FALL ASLEEP.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.660
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

34:15.314 --> 34:20.101
GABRIEL, MY NAME
IS CLARKE GRIFFIN.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.885
JOSEPHINE LIGHTBOURNE
IS IN MY HEAD.

34:21.929 --> 34:25.150
IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS,
WE'RE COMING TO YOU.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.716
THIS IS INSANE.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.718
HE DIDN'T RESPOND
TO THEIR CALL.

34:28.762 --> 34:30.242
HE'S PROBABLY DEAD.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.548
PLEASE, LET'S JUST
GO BACK TO SANCTUM.

34:32.592 --> 34:33.723
NOT A CHANCE.

34:33.767 --> 34:35.377
JEEZ. FINE, I'LL DRIVE.

34:35.421 --> 34:38.641
BUT FOR THAT, YOU DO
HAVE TO GIVE ME BACK CONTROL.

34:38.685 --> 34:39.729
CLARKE, YOU DON'T
KNOW HOW TO--

34:42.210 --> 34:44.821
WHAT ELSE OF MINE
HAVE YOU STOLEN?

34:56.268 --> 34:58.313
CLARKE, OVER RADIO:
GABRIEL, MY NAME
IS CLARKE GRIFFIN.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.272
MAN, OVER RADIO:
...WE HAVE
A PRISONER.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.803
OCTAVIA: I KNOW WHAT
I HAVE TO DO NOW.

35:09.846 --> 35:11.065
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:11.109 --> 35:12.240
WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE
THE ANOMALY?

35:12.284 --> 35:14.416
I STILL DON'T KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.375
WAIT.

35:16.418 --> 35:17.854
PLEASE.

35:17.898 --> 35:20.161
I THINK I DESERVE
AN EXPLANATION.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.076
DESERVE'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.470
THE ANOMALY GAVE ME
A SECOND CHANCE.

35:24.513 --> 35:27.995
AND NOW I NEED TO EARN IT.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.224
MAN: JERICHO TO PROVIDENCE,
WE HAVE A PRISONER

35:39.267 --> 35:41.095
THAT CLAIMS THAT PRIMES
CAN NOW MAKE HOSTS.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.011
IF YOU'RE OUT THERE...

35:45.534 --> 35:47.971
CLARKE, ON RADIO: GABRIEL,
MY NAME'S CLARKE GRIFFIN.

35:48.015 --> 35:50.060
JOSEPHINE LIGHTBOURNE
IS IN MY HEAD.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.846
IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS,
WE'RE COMING TO YOU.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.023
YOU KNOW HER?

35:57.242 --> 35:58.939
IF JOSEPHINE'S
IN HER HEAD,

35:58.982 --> 36:00.810
THEN SHE'S IN ALL
KINDS OF TROUBLE.

36:00.854 --> 36:03.552
THEN MY PEOPLE ARE, TOO.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.380
I HAVE TO GO.

36:05.424 --> 36:06.642
WHAT FOR?

36:06.686 --> 36:09.210
SHE'S COMING HERE.

36:09.254 --> 36:12.344
THINGS ARE ABOUT
TO GET WEIRD.

36:19.438 --> 36:20.961
RAVEN: ALL ABOARD
WHO'S COMING ABOARD.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.441
WE ARE GO FOR LAUNCH.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.399
ALL WE NEED NOW IS
THE SECOND COMING

36:24.443 --> 36:26.009
OF MARCUS KANE.

36:30.492 --> 36:31.711
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

36:31.754 --> 36:34.322
EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WAY.

36:34.366 --> 36:35.236
INDRA?

36:35.280 --> 36:36.368
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

36:36.411 --> 36:37.804
A FAVOR FOR A FRIEND.

36:37.847 --> 36:40.285
INDRA: RAVEN, NOW.

36:41.808 --> 36:44.071
ONE MORE STEP AND
THE QUEEN DIES.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.206
KEEP THEM HERE.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.816
STOP, THAT BELONGS
TO ME!

36:49.859 --> 36:51.339
MAN: DON'T MOVE.

36:51.383 --> 36:53.298
WE HAD A DEAL.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.430
LOOKS LIKE THE DEAL'S OFF.

36:55.474 --> 36:58.172
ABBY, PLEASE
DO SOMETHING.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.567
ABBY, PLEASE DON'T
FIGHT THIS.

37:01.610 --> 37:04.439
FIGHT WHAT?

37:06.398 --> 37:08.226
WHERE'S MARCUS?

37:09.879 --> 37:11.751
HE WANTS US TO
KEEP YOU HERE.

37:11.794 --> 37:14.841
ABBY, DON'T.

37:14.884 --> 37:17.235
YOU DON'T WANT TO
SEE THIS.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.022
YOU LET ME OFF THIS
BRIDGE RIGHT NOW.

37:22.065 --> 37:24.329
I PROMISED HIM, ABBY.

37:24.372 --> 37:27.288
RAVEN...PLEASE.

37:29.943 --> 37:32.380
I CAN'T LOSE HIM.

37:34.817 --> 37:37.646
ALL RIGHT.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.561
IF ANYONE ELSE
TRIES TO LEAVE,

37:39.605 --> 37:41.389
KILL THE PRIME.

37:43.826 --> 37:46.046
LET'S GO.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.536
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
AIRLOCK SEALED.

37:57.579 --> 37:59.320
NO!

37:59.364 --> 38:00.321
MARCUS, WAIT!

38:00.365 --> 38:02.410
ABBY, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HERE.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.456
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

38:08.373 --> 38:09.461
PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU.

38:09.504 --> 38:11.114
INDRA, IT'S OK.

38:11.158 --> 38:13.073
SHE DESERVES A CHANCE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.511
RAVEN: HE CAN
HEAR YOU NOW.

38:23.213 --> 38:26.391
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO SEE THIS, ABBY.

38:26.434 --> 38:28.218
NOT AGAIN.

38:29.481 --> 38:32.832
PLEASE, MARCUS,
I'M BEGGING YOU.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.445
DON'T DO THIS.

38:47.716 --> 38:50.545
IT'S ALREADY DONE.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.985
THIS...

38:56.029 --> 38:57.900
THIS IS WRONG, ABBY.

38:57.944 --> 39:00.381
I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT.

39:00.425 --> 39:04.037
I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU DID IT.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.908
IF I LOST YOU,

39:05.952 --> 39:10.391
I COULD GET YOU BACK,

39:10.435 --> 39:12.567
I'D PROBABLY
DO THE SAME.

39:14.439 --> 39:18.573
BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF

39:18.617 --> 39:19.661
AND NEITHER CAN I.

39:19.705 --> 39:22.403
MARCUS, PLEASE.
WE'RE SO CLOSE.

39:22.447 --> 39:25.667
WE CAN MAKE A NEW LIFE.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.800
WE CAN START OVER.

39:27.843 --> 39:30.585
NOT LIKE THIS.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.415
YOU TOLD ME ONCE THAT
YOUR JOB WAS

39:34.459 --> 39:36.678
TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE DESERVE TO SURVIVE.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.593
YOU REMEMBER?

39:40.334 --> 39:42.031
THAT'S WHAT
I'M DOING NOW.

39:42.075 --> 39:43.642
NO, PLEASE.

39:43.685 --> 39:45.426
I CAN'T DO THIS
ON MY OWN.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.646
YES, YOU CAN, ABBY.

39:47.689 --> 39:50.649
YOU'RE SO STRONG.

39:50.692 --> 39:53.303
YOU'RE SO MUCH
STRONGER THAN ME.

39:53.347 --> 39:57.003
YOU SAVED ME
SO MANY TIMES.

39:57.046 --> 40:00.789
NOT JUST MY LIFE,

40:00.833 --> 40:02.661
ME.

40:02.704 --> 40:04.619
I NEED YOU.

40:06.491 --> 40:08.797
I LOVE YOU.

40:08.841 --> 40:11.147
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

40:12.845 --> 40:16.239
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN
I EVER THOUGHT I
COULD LOVE ANYONE.

40:16.283 --> 40:18.198
BUT IF I DON'T
DO THIS NOW,

40:18.241 --> 40:20.113
THEN WE BOTH LIVE
TO REGRET IT,

40:20.156 --> 40:23.508
AND SO MANY MORE
INNOCENT LIVES
WILL BE LOST.

40:25.074 --> 40:28.034
THIS IS HOW WE GET
OUR HUMANITY BACK.

40:38.610 --> 40:42.396
IN PEACE, MAY YOU
LEAVE THE SHORE.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.573
BOTH: IN LOVE, MAY
YOU FIND THE NEXT.

40:45.617 --> 40:48.010
SAFE PASSAGE ON
YOUR TRAVELS,

40:48.054 --> 40:50.839
UNTIL YOUR FINAL
JOURNEY TO THE GROUND.

40:50.883 --> 40:54.495
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.628
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.
