00:52.218 --> 00:55.586
Good girl. Huh, Misty?

00:55.588 --> 00:56.722
Yeah, that's good.

01:04.662 --> 01:07.033
You're my best friend,
you know that?

01:08.200 --> 01:10.536
You know that?

01:22.513 --> 01:23.982
Misty.

01:54.746 --> 01:57.714

02:31.317 --> 02:34.451
No matter what happens,
I'm always proud of you.

02:34.453 --> 02:36.456
Thanks, Mom.

02:45.931 --> 02:48.431
- That's adorable.
- That was really nice.

02:48.433 --> 02:49.669
That's so cute.

02:53.038 --> 02:55.506
With only five spots
this year,

02:55.508 --> 02:58.608
I just wanna remind
all of you younger girls,

02:58.610 --> 03:01.546
if you don't make it this
year, don't lose heart.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.780
Keep trying,
and come back again.

03:03.782 --> 03:09.487
I wanna bring up Mary Higgins,
your team varsity captain!

03:09.489 --> 03:13.225
And now, your varsity squad,
in no particular order.

03:14.092 --> 03:16.295
Erica Murphy!

03:17.830 --> 03:20.033
Amy Tsai!

03:20.866 --> 03:22.668
Tammy Tilson!

03:25.037 --> 03:26.873
And last,
but not least,

03:28.007 --> 03:30.109
Lily Davidson!

03:31.711 --> 03:33.710
Thank you.

03:33.712 --> 03:36.613
Congratulations, girls, we
have a lot of work to do this summer.

03:36.615 --> 03:38.948
And congratulations
to all of you.

03:38.950 --> 03:42.388
Keep working hard, and we
will see you again next year.

03:44.622 --> 03:45.657
Thank you so much.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.495
- Lily!
- Hey.

03:51.497 --> 03:54.231
- Thank you so much for everything.
- See, what did I tell you?

03:54.233 --> 03:56.433
I can't believe it, but it wouldn't
have happened if it wasn't for you.

03:56.435 --> 03:57.567
What are you
talking about?

03:57.569 --> 03:59.036
Depending on how
the summer goes,

03:59.038 --> 04:01.241
I could be looking at
my new co-captain!

04:03.008 --> 04:05.411
- You were so great.
- Thanks.

04:07.579 --> 04:09.546
Yeah, you know what?
I literally just walked in.

04:09.548 --> 04:11.048
Let me get that
right to you.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.483
And, uh...

04:12.485 --> 04:14.417
Yeah, no, I'll do it
right now.

04:14.419 --> 04:16.019
- Thanks, Dad.
- Absolutely.

04:16.021 --> 04:19.091
Yep. Okay. I'm on it,
I'm on it now.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.461
I need to check one thing,
all right?

04:24.463 --> 04:26.430
<i>This is a
huge part of next year for us,</i>

04:26.432 --> 04:28.098
<i>so we gotta close
this deal down.</i>

04:28.100 --> 04:29.669
You know what? Just
give me a minute, okay?

04:31.536 --> 04:33.805
I'm so sorry. Five minutes,
and I'm all yours.

04:39.545 --> 04:42.045
<i>All right, listen, I can find someone
else if you aren't up for it.</i>

04:42.047 --> 04:43.680
Just still looking.
Give me another second.

04:43.682 --> 04:45.515
Hey! Wait,
wait, wait!

04:45.517 --> 04:47.286
How'd it go today?
I forgot to ask.

04:48.252 --> 04:50.086
I made the squad.

04:50.088 --> 04:51.921
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

04:51.923 --> 04:53.591
- That's amazing!
- I was so nervous!

04:53.593 --> 04:55.091
- That's awesome!
- Thanks, Dad.

04:55.093 --> 04:57.293
Oh, my gosh,
that's amazing!

04:57.295 --> 04:59.062
I mean, I was so nervous.

04:59.064 --> 05:01.065
I'm still the only person who
can't do a back handspring...

05:01.067 --> 05:03.601
It doesn't matter. You did it!
It's fantastic, you made it!

05:03.603 --> 05:05.672
- Thank you.
- <i>William? Hey, man, you there?</i>

05:07.238 --> 05:09.606
Yes, right here.

05:09.608 --> 05:11.142
<i>Will, I really need boots on the
ground floor for this one, man.</i>

05:11.144 --> 05:13.310
- Take it. You can take it.
- Okay.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.945
I'm gonna finish this up,
then I'm gonna come inside

05:14.947 --> 05:16.613
- and we're gonna celebrate, okay?
- Okay.

05:16.615 --> 05:18.214
- I love you.
- All right, I love you, too.

05:18.216 --> 05:20.419
All right. Hey.

05:21.620 --> 05:22.854
Okay.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.793
Great.

05:29.795 --> 05:32.127
- Dad!
- Sorry.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.433
- Hey there.
- Hi.

05:37.435 --> 05:39.269
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

05:39.271 --> 05:41.438
I'm sorry I couldn't
be there for you today.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.473
- Are you upset?
- Why would I be upset?

05:43.475 --> 05:46.276
Dad never knows
these kinda things.

05:46.278 --> 05:49.048
I mean, it would have
been nice.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.849
I knew it.

05:52.851 --> 05:56.452
But seriously, Dad, it's okay. I know
you're totally swamped with work.

05:56.454 --> 05:57.954
I'm excited for summer
to be here,

05:57.956 --> 06:00.723
and to be with my friends,
and go to camp.

06:00.725 --> 06:03.726
And about the summer...

06:03.728 --> 06:06.195
No, no, no. No, you're going
to cheer camp, rest assured.

06:06.197 --> 06:08.031
No questions about that.

06:08.033 --> 06:09.899
It's just that
it turns out that...

06:09.901 --> 06:11.502
That my work is gonna
keep me out of town

06:11.504 --> 06:13.702
a little more than I
thought it was going to.

06:13.704 --> 06:16.438
That's fine.
I can manage.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.140
Lily, you're 17.

06:18.142 --> 06:19.942
Yeah, which is technically
a young adult.

06:19.944 --> 06:22.178
I think you meant to say,
"Still a child."

06:22.180 --> 06:25.615
A child who's going away
to college in a year.

06:25.617 --> 06:27.317
What are you trying
to say, Dad?

06:27.319 --> 06:28.721
You wanna get me a
babysitter, or something?

06:29.988 --> 06:32.322
I actually already did.

06:32.324 --> 06:34.524
- No, you didn't.
- Honey, listen.

06:34.526 --> 06:36.560
- This is gonna be great.
- Please tell me this isn't happening.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.995
Look, at this point it is very important
to have a strong female persona,

06:38.997 --> 06:40.096
and who better
to take care of you...

06:40.098 --> 06:41.531
Please tell me
you didn't call...

06:41.533 --> 06:44.334
- Aunt Glo?
- Aunt Glo, yes.

06:44.336 --> 06:47.704
Are you kidding me?
My life's ruined!

06:47.706 --> 06:50.707
- Oh, come on. It's not gonna be that bad.
- My summer is ruined, Dad.

06:50.709 --> 06:53.310
Hey, apparently she has
a ranch now.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.245
Doomed. I'm doomed.

06:55.247 --> 06:57.180
All right, maybe it'll be
a little bad.

06:57.182 --> 06:58.848
But it's only gonna be
five weeks.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.450
It's like a Band-Aid,
you know?

07:00.452 --> 07:02.918
Just rip it off,
get it over with.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.288
Okay, for the record, Dad,

07:04.290 --> 07:07.390
a Band-Aid lasts three days,
maybe a week.

07:07.392 --> 07:10.793
- Think about it like an adventure.
- An adventure?

07:10.795 --> 07:12.497
An adventure in the middle
of nowhere?

07:14.934 --> 07:18.435
I'm protesting.
This is me protesting.

07:18.437 --> 07:20.336
Protesting right now.

07:20.338 --> 07:21.505
Oh!

07:21.507 --> 07:23.206
So, this is...

07:23.208 --> 07:24.841
This is what protesting
looks like.

07:24.843 --> 07:25.978
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hmm?

07:28.079 --> 07:29.649
Got it.

07:35.387 --> 07:36.954
Do you know how much further
this is?

07:36.956 --> 07:38.587
It feels really far out.

07:38.589 --> 07:41.892
Mmm-hmm. The nearest gas
station was five miles back.

07:41.894 --> 07:43.627
I pay attention now.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.730
Last week when I ran outta
gas, we had no water.

07:46.732 --> 07:49.800
No cell service. Phew.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.305
The customers
were not happy.

07:54.105 --> 07:57.707
- Do you ever get cell service?
- Not really.

07:57.709 --> 07:59.644
But don't worry,
I got plenty of gas today.

08:00.411 --> 08:01.947
Oh!

08:06.519 --> 08:09.586
Now, there's something you
don't see every day, huh?

08:09.588 --> 08:11.454
I love America.

08:37.984 --> 08:40.517
- Lily!
- Aunt Glo!

08:40.519 --> 08:43.020
- Please give me five stars.
- I will.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.122
I'm so glad you're here!

08:45.124 --> 08:47.791
It's so good
to see you.

08:47.793 --> 08:50.127
Look at you.
You're all grown up!

08:50.129 --> 08:52.728
I can't believe the last time I saw you
was right before my Tanzania trip.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.065
Wait. Maybe it was the Philippines.
No, it was Thailand.

08:55.067 --> 08:58.634
Whatever. Come on in, everyone
can't wait to meet you.

08:58.636 --> 09:00.005
"Everyone"?

09:02.374 --> 09:05.644
- Skip! Lily's here.
- Hi, Lily.

09:06.511 --> 09:07.679
Hi, Skip.

09:09.313 --> 09:10.946
He knows my name?

09:10.948 --> 09:13.617
Skip, don't you dare tell
her we've been practicing.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.789
Isn't he cute? He likes you already.
Yes, you do.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.791
And this is Henry.
Or Henrietta.

09:21.793 --> 09:23.560
We're not really sure
which one,

09:23.562 --> 09:25.031
so we're just goin' with
the one she responds to.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.835
She's so big!

09:31.370 --> 09:33.737
- Bunnies wear harnesses?
- Oh, yeah.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.507
And Henrietta's favorite color
is pink, isn't it, Henrietta?

09:37.509 --> 09:41.313
Oh, that reminds me. You're actually
ready for your afternoon walk.

09:45.850 --> 09:47.850
You two, don't worry.

09:47.852 --> 09:49.953
She is gonna be here all summer long.

09:49.955 --> 09:53.259
- Okay.
- They love you already.

10:04.735 --> 10:06.770
It's perfect, Aunt Glo.
I love it.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.903
- You do?
- Yes.

10:07.905 --> 10:10.507
I'm so glad.

10:10.509 --> 10:13.042
I really had you in mind
when I designed it,

10:13.044 --> 10:15.246
and I couldn't wait
for you to see it.

10:22.453 --> 10:24.921
That was
your mom's first pony.

10:24.923 --> 10:27.225
She got him
on her 10th birthday.

10:28.394 --> 10:31.460
The day she fell
in love with riding.

10:31.462 --> 10:34.229
That day changed
her life forever.

10:34.231 --> 10:37.401
She was so happy.

10:37.403 --> 10:40.373
- Thank you, Aunt Glo.
- You're welcome.

10:46.644 --> 10:49.848
I guess I'll put this
over here.

10:53.284 --> 10:56.419
Aunt Glo, who is that?

10:56.421 --> 11:00.022
Oh, yeah, that's Sam. He
stays in the guest bungalow.

11:00.024 --> 11:02.858
My only hired help.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.629
And he ain't too bad
to look at, is he?

11:07.732 --> 11:09.732
Honey, I know you didn't think
you were gonna be spending

11:09.734 --> 11:11.300
your summer here.

11:11.302 --> 11:14.403
But I promise
we'll make it fun, okay?

11:14.405 --> 11:16.573
- I know. It'll be fun.
- It will be.

11:16.575 --> 11:19.675
All right, I'm gonna run into
town to overnight something,

11:19.677 --> 11:23.012
and if you can,
please walk Henrietta.

11:23.014 --> 11:25.717
- She would love it.
- Okay.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.656
Come on, Henrietta.

11:34.359 --> 11:37.495
Sometimes, we have to go places
and do things we don't wanna do.

11:47.873 --> 11:48.908
Come on.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.086
Okay, let's go.

12:01.852 --> 12:04.253
Well, well, well.

12:04.255 --> 12:06.723
Look who's
on bunny duty already.

12:06.725 --> 12:09.228
Please tell me I don't have
to do this every day.

12:10.528 --> 12:14.129
Three times a day,
if you're lucky.

12:14.131 --> 12:16.501
Just be glad you're not
on stall duty.

12:17.668 --> 12:19.237
Lily, right?

12:20.238 --> 12:22.539
Sam Carver.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.708
Nice to meet you,
Cowboy Sam.

12:24.710 --> 12:28.344
Your Aunt Glo has been talking
about her Lily since day one.

12:28.346 --> 12:31.882
- Sorry about that.
- Doesn't bother me none.

12:31.884 --> 12:34.349
I'm just glad to see
the mysterious Lily

12:34.351 --> 12:38.321
finally came to pay
her Aunt Glo a visit.

12:38.323 --> 12:41.426
You always do your chores on
horseback, or just the sprinkler ones?

12:42.628 --> 12:44.727
Okay, smarty.

12:44.729 --> 12:48.031
I heard through the grapevine that I'm
gonna get an assistant this summer.

12:48.033 --> 12:51.734
And if she doesn't watch out,
she'll be doin' it on foot.

12:51.736 --> 12:54.403
Not knowin' how
to ride and all.

12:54.405 --> 12:56.474
Who says I don't know
how to ride?

12:58.610 --> 13:00.642
Okay.

13:00.644 --> 13:02.280
Call you hired.

13:03.381 --> 13:05.113
That just about does it.

13:10.489 --> 13:12.588
Dang kids.

13:12.590 --> 13:15.761
I told them they could ride here if
they remembered to shut the gate.

13:59.671 --> 14:03.175
Let me guess.
You must be a cheerleader.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.512
Why you gotta mess with
her like that, Ava?

14:09.514 --> 14:14.017
I apologize about my friend.
She thinks she's cool.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.652
Yeah, ever since her parents
got her the new DS 250

14:16.654 --> 14:18.588
and she can get
to the top the fastest,

14:18.590 --> 14:21.858
- she uh, thinks she owns it.
- That's okay.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.627
I could see how wearin'
all that black attire

14:23.629 --> 14:25.462
would make someone feel
really good about themselves.

14:25.464 --> 14:27.166
Oh, Snap!

14:28.500 --> 14:31.434
You ride, cheerleader?

14:31.436 --> 14:36.373
- She means a horse.
- Oh, yeah. I ride.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.675
And my name's Lily.
Lily Davidson.

14:39.677 --> 14:42.210
You should come
ride with us, then.

14:42.212 --> 14:45.982
Yeah, we come every Friday.

14:45.984 --> 14:49.855
- We promise to be nice.
- More importantly, we promise to be fun.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.388
Okay, sure. Why not?

14:53.390 --> 14:55.925
All right, we're going up
to Angel's Peak,

14:55.927 --> 14:57.962
so, you wanna meet here
like at 1:00?

14:59.431 --> 15:00.799
Cool.

15:02.033 --> 15:04.269
- See you then.
- Later.

15:18.649 --> 15:20.583
What'd they say?

15:20.585 --> 15:24.353
Nothing, they just asked if I wanted
to go riding with them on Friday.

15:24.355 --> 15:25.557
Did you tell 'em
to shut the gate?

15:27.359 --> 15:28.427
No.

15:30.662 --> 15:32.594
Okay.

15:32.596 --> 15:35.331
Well, let's get you
squared away on horseback

15:35.333 --> 15:38.236
if you're gonna be pow-wowing
with them all summer.

15:39.169 --> 15:40.438
Okay.

15:48.947 --> 15:51.948
Okay, it's time
to take your pick.

15:51.950 --> 15:54.617
You got this one.
Great temperament.

15:54.619 --> 15:56.219
She's really good.
Bomb-proof.

15:56.221 --> 15:59.191
Good to ride,
won't run off with you.

16:02.894 --> 16:04.994
Or we got this guy here.

16:04.996 --> 16:08.430
He's good to ride as well, but
a little stubborn at times.

16:08.432 --> 16:10.967
Nothing a girl like
you can't handle.

16:16.106 --> 16:18.177
What about him?

16:19.744 --> 16:20.946
Pistachio?

16:21.812 --> 16:23.246
Yeah.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.150
No, you don't
want Pistachio.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.818
Why not?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.254
He's a little rough
around the edges.

16:31.054 --> 16:33.422
Your Aunt Glo wants me
to tune him up a little bit,

16:33.424 --> 16:35.259
but I just haven't had
the time.

16:40.731 --> 16:43.769
Pistachio.
I choose Pistachio.

16:48.105 --> 16:49.972
Nah, you don't want him.

16:49.974 --> 16:51.708
Come on. Look at him.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.376
It's not his fault
he's so antsy.

16:53.378 --> 16:55.480
You said it yourself,
you don't have time for him.

17:06.857 --> 17:08.391
Fine.

17:08.393 --> 17:10.859
Looks like your
lucky week, buddy.

17:12.530 --> 17:15.366
Sorry, guys. Pistachio
just wanted it more.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.200
Supper's almost ready.

17:19.202 --> 17:21.403
- Sam, do you wanna stay for dinner?
- I would, but I'm beat.

17:21.405 --> 17:23.538
- Thank you, though.
- You're welcome.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.607
Aunt Glo, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna call my dad.

17:25.608 --> 17:28.546
Yeah, of course. You know what, use
the landline. It's right down there.

17:42.493 --> 17:44.527
<i>Lily, how's everything goin'?</i>

17:44.529 --> 17:47.630
Hey, Dad. Not too bad,
actually.

17:47.632 --> 17:49.231
Well, that's good to hear.

17:49.233 --> 17:51.867
Does that mean you're not
upset with me anymore?

17:51.869 --> 17:53.702
Oh, I'm still upset.

17:53.704 --> 17:55.438
Just not as much.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.707
I'll be right there.

17:57.709 --> 18:01.110
Um, so, you see, I told you Aunt Glo
is taking good care of you, right?

18:01.112 --> 18:03.112
William, gotta go.

18:03.114 --> 18:04.947
I'm coming.

18:04.949 --> 18:07.350
<i>Look, I'm actually on my way
to the airport, honey.</i>

18:07.352 --> 18:10.119
I gotta get on a flight, and I wanna
call you when we can talk more.

18:10.121 --> 18:12.389
<i>So can I call you
after I land?</i>

18:12.391 --> 18:14.524
- Sure, Dad.
- I love you.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.461
- Love you.
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>

18:22.134 --> 18:24.167
I introduced her
to all the horses, so...

18:24.169 --> 18:26.702
That's nice. Who did
she respond to?

18:26.704 --> 18:29.271
- Pistachio.
- Your favorite.

18:32.542 --> 18:35.344
Okay, in the morning.
See you bright and early.

18:35.346 --> 18:37.180
Bright and early,
Cowboy Sam.

18:37.182 --> 18:38.616
- Have a good night!
- Good night.

18:40.085 --> 18:42.821
This, my dear,
is your appetizer.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.659
Well?

18:50.028 --> 18:51.760
Special.

18:51.762 --> 18:53.363
That's what I like to
call "special," Aunt Glo.

18:53.365 --> 18:56.332
Okay, I'll take that. It's
nice, "special" is good.

18:56.334 --> 18:58.968
- Look who's here!
- Oh! Henrietta.

18:58.970 --> 19:00.506
We didn't forget
about you!

19:01.905 --> 19:03.274
Does it need
more ginger?

19:04.174 --> 19:05.376
Or another carrot?

19:09.346 --> 19:11.448
You know, this might be the
first home-cooked meal

19:11.450 --> 19:12.951
I've had in a really
long time.

19:13.951 --> 19:15.951
Honey, your dad tries.

19:15.953 --> 19:18.353
- He really does.
- I know. I know he does.

19:18.355 --> 19:20.789
It's just sometimes I wonder
what would it be like

19:20.791 --> 19:22.257
if my mom were
here, you know?

19:22.259 --> 19:23.961
Like what kind of stuff
she would make.

19:24.630 --> 19:25.631
Me too.

19:27.999 --> 19:29.731
Hey, you know what?

19:29.733 --> 19:32.234
Why don't I teach you how to
make her favorite recipes?

19:32.236 --> 19:34.804
Like this one.
She loved this dish.

19:34.806 --> 19:36.072
Really?

19:36.074 --> 19:38.007
We used to cook together
all the time.

19:38.009 --> 19:40.409
We made all kinds of things,
and she loved to bake.

19:40.411 --> 19:43.345
Cookies were
her favorite.

19:43.347 --> 19:46.081
I don't know, Aunt Glo. I'm
not really much of a cook.

19:46.083 --> 19:49.450
Well, then even more of a
reason for me to teach you.

19:49.452 --> 19:51.120
Besides, we have Sam,

19:51.122 --> 19:53.659
and anything that's not edible,
he'll get the leftovers.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.293
Okay.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.257
- Morning.
- Morning.

21:00.924 --> 21:02.024
Lily!

21:02.026 --> 21:02.995
Sam's here.

21:04.895 --> 21:07.296
Shoot. Shoot, shoot, shoot!

21:07.298 --> 21:08.400
Shoot.

21:10.434 --> 21:12.503
Oh, boy. Wonder what
she's doing up there.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.009
Girls.

21:18.308 --> 21:19.778
I'll be down in a second!

21:24.915 --> 21:26.615
What are we waiting for?

21:26.617 --> 21:27.752
I was wondering when you
were gonna show up.

21:32.589 --> 21:33.759
Have fun!

21:38.028 --> 21:39.929
I got some fences
to mend this morning.

21:39.931 --> 21:42.267
- You wanna help me?
- Sure.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.237
Okay, hop on.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.110
I thought you knew
how to ride.

21:54.112 --> 21:55.279
I got it.
I finally got it.

21:57.949 --> 21:58.950
Left foot.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.852
- All right, can you give me a boost?
- Yeah.

22:02.854 --> 22:04.655
One, two, three.

22:06.191 --> 22:08.958
- Okay.
- Phew. Okay.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.660
Now, don't go anywhere
until I tell you, okay?

22:11.662 --> 22:12.864
All right. All right.

22:18.502 --> 22:20.369
- Where you going?
- I wasn't going anywhere.

22:20.371 --> 22:21.769
I just...

22:21.771 --> 22:24.038
Whoa! Whoa!

22:24.040 --> 22:26.208
Hold him up.
Pull him back!

22:27.511 --> 22:29.380
- Gather your reins!
- Help!

22:34.419 --> 22:35.520
I'm okay!

22:37.422 --> 22:38.390
Lily!

22:39.757 --> 22:41.090
- What happened?
- I'm fine.

22:41.092 --> 22:42.361
He went to get
the horse.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.033
Did you know that he...

23:10.488 --> 23:11.456
Should've
known better.

23:13.657 --> 23:17.427
I don't understand.
She's ridden before.

23:17.429 --> 23:20.095
You can never trust 'em
when they say they can ride.

23:20.097 --> 23:21.930
That usually means

23:21.932 --> 23:24.232
they can't ride
a stick horse through water.

23:24.234 --> 23:26.436
Well, she's had lessons.

23:26.438 --> 23:30.205
Let me guess. Pony camp?

23:30.207 --> 23:34.410
Mr. P here took off with her before
she could even gather her reins.

23:34.412 --> 23:37.479
Yeah, you heard me.
You know what you did.

23:37.481 --> 23:40.315
Pistachio, what do you think
you're doing?

23:40.317 --> 23:41.752
Don't you know who she is?

23:47.025 --> 23:48.360
Do you know
who she is?

24:03.508 --> 24:04.709
Come here, honey.

24:07.077 --> 24:08.446
I'm not a rider.

24:09.547 --> 24:11.080
It's okay.

24:11.082 --> 24:12.751
I'm nothing like her.

24:15.420 --> 24:17.087
Nothing like her,
Aunt Glo.

24:18.556 --> 24:19.825
Honey.

24:22.326 --> 24:24.462
You are exactly like her.

24:25.762 --> 24:27.497
You are.

24:27.499 --> 24:29.931
You have her spunk.

24:29.933 --> 24:32.837
You look like her.
Her love of life.

24:34.238 --> 24:36.041
You are like her
in every way.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.644
And you don't
have to...

24:42.113 --> 24:45.115
You don't have to love
riding to know your mom.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.319
But that's
who she was.

24:49.487 --> 24:51.153
That's who she was.

24:51.155 --> 24:52.257
That's what she did
every day of her life.

24:56.126 --> 24:57.959
You don't have to.

24:57.961 --> 24:58.963
It's okay.

25:10.508 --> 25:12.373
What do we do, guys?

25:12.375 --> 25:14.677
There's no way that horse
is making it up this hill.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.014
I don't know.

25:28.358 --> 25:30.494
Come on, girl.
You can do it.

25:31.729 --> 25:32.931
Come on, you little thing.

25:35.165 --> 25:38.167
I say we head back down.

25:38.169 --> 25:42.671
Just kidding, you're not little.
You're mighty and the opposite of big.

25:42.673 --> 25:45.173
You guys see that? That's the
fastest she's moved all day.

25:45.175 --> 25:46.243
I call that a success.

25:47.211 --> 25:48.246
We made it.

25:51.281 --> 25:52.416
This is the top?

25:53.317 --> 25:54.385
Yeah.

25:59.022 --> 26:01.356
Shortest ride ever.

26:01.358 --> 26:03.060
We're going to tackle
this another day, Lily.

26:04.996 --> 26:06.996
- Is it something I did?
- No, no, no, no!

26:06.998 --> 26:09.234
- We're all just really hangry.
- Oh!

26:10.367 --> 26:12.200
Okay. Me too.

26:12.202 --> 26:13.238
Come on.

26:22.579 --> 26:24.680
Managed to get that pony
of yours squared off?

26:24.682 --> 26:26.349
Funny.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.217
You would've swore she was
staying in a five-star hotel

26:28.219 --> 26:30.518
the way she bolted past
me into her stall.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.389
I mean, she almost
ran me over.

26:33.857 --> 26:36.225
Well, I mean,
if I had to guess,

26:36.227 --> 26:39.798
she does two, maybe three
trail rides a year.

26:40.565 --> 26:41.566
No joke.

26:43.233 --> 26:44.734
Thanks for coming
out today.

26:44.736 --> 26:48.540
It's not often we see
any new faces around here.

26:50.674 --> 26:53.409
It's beautiful, huh?

26:53.411 --> 26:57.546
Yeah, for a bunch of country
bumpkins with no cell service,

26:57.548 --> 26:59.915
you sure know how to make
the mundane eventful.

26:59.917 --> 27:02.884
Hey. I actually have
two bars out here.

27:02.886 --> 27:05.554
Yeah, and excuse me,
"country bumpkins"?

27:05.556 --> 27:07.555
I'll have you know, cheerleader,
that I've been to almost every

27:07.557 --> 27:09.292
major city in the US.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.829
Probably more than the
three of you, combined.

27:12.863 --> 27:16.565
See, Ava comes from a
long line of riders,

27:16.567 --> 27:19.804
and let's just say she's
very proud of the fact.

27:21.739 --> 27:24.172
I guess I could
say that, too.

27:24.174 --> 27:26.010
The part about coming from
a long line of riders.

27:27.411 --> 27:29.076
Yeah, I heard, um...

27:29.078 --> 27:30.478
Your... Your mom rode?

27:30.480 --> 27:32.280
Mmm-hmm.

27:32.282 --> 27:35.284
Apparently, my mom was,
like, extremely talented.

27:35.286 --> 27:37.286
Or so they tell me.
I don't really remember.

27:37.288 --> 27:39.289
I was like two years old
when it happened.

27:42.826 --> 27:44.593
I'm sorry.

27:44.595 --> 27:45.663
It is what it is.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.967
Hey, you two!
Come sit with us.

27:54.305 --> 27:56.841
Hey, you should try this.
It's my family recipe.

27:59.176 --> 28:00.444
Okay, what is it?

28:02.346 --> 28:03.845
Mmm. What's in this?

28:03.847 --> 28:05.983
I think my aunt would
really like this recipe.

28:09.619 --> 28:10.621
What?

28:13.190 --> 28:14.558
Why are you
guys laughing?

28:18.028 --> 28:19.029
No, you didn't.

28:20.330 --> 28:21.532
No, you didn't.

28:23.534 --> 28:25.867
- You don't like it?
- No, you didn't!

28:25.869 --> 28:27.569
You fed me horse grain?

28:27.571 --> 28:30.338
I told you, it's my
family's secret recipe!

28:30.340 --> 28:34.043
- You can eat it, don't worry.
- Yeah, it's fine!

28:34.045 --> 28:35.447
This is part
of my everyday diet.

28:36.146 --> 28:37.313
Ew!

28:37.315 --> 28:39.849
Ava, you are so bad.

28:39.851 --> 28:41.850
- It's funny, right?
- It was funny.

28:41.852 --> 28:43.251
It wasn't that funny.

28:43.253 --> 28:44.419
Let's not pick on
the new girl

28:44.421 --> 28:46.255
every single chance
we get, okay?

28:46.257 --> 28:49.490
Let's, like, do it
every other chance.

28:49.492 --> 28:50.992
Ha-ha!

28:50.994 --> 28:52.496
You guys better watch
your back.

28:54.664 --> 28:57.132
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
- She's gonna get you.

28:57.134 --> 28:58.569
- Oh!
- I'm scared.

29:00.337 --> 29:02.004
I'm gonna get you guys.

29:02.006 --> 29:03.005
- She's coming for us.
- I think she's serious.

29:03.007 --> 29:04.409
Yeah, I am.

29:10.247 --> 29:12.914
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah.

29:12.916 --> 29:15.985
Um, by the way,
we go every week.

29:15.987 --> 29:20.957
So don't let today or Ava
deter you from coming back.

29:20.959 --> 29:21.960
We like you.

29:24.895 --> 29:25.896
I'll think about it.

29:32.368 --> 29:34.937
Although...

29:34.939 --> 29:37.509
You might wanna think about
getting a faster horse.

29:48.419 --> 29:49.684
Who was that?

29:49.686 --> 29:53.221
Just my lovely neighbor,
Chuck Fromer.

29:53.223 --> 29:56.091
He thinks he's the boss of me and
everyone else in the valley.

29:56.093 --> 29:57.859
He really is annoying.

29:57.861 --> 29:59.460
What does he want?

29:59.462 --> 30:01.630
Well, he thinks he controls
the easement along the road,

30:01.632 --> 30:04.767
but I keep telling him my sales
documents say that it's mine.

30:04.769 --> 30:06.201
But whatever.

30:06.203 --> 30:07.870
We don't need to worry
about old grumpy Chuck.

30:07.872 --> 30:09.939
I want to hear about your day.
How was it?

30:09.941 --> 30:12.076
- I had fun.
- Well, good!

30:34.365 --> 30:35.596
- <i>Hey!</i>
- <i>What's up, girl?</i>

30:35.598 --> 30:37.132
- <i>We miss you!</i>
- Hi.

30:37.134 --> 30:38.199
<i>We're hanging out
at the lake today.</i>

30:38.201 --> 30:40.134
<i>Amy's dad got a new boat.</i>

30:40.136 --> 30:41.370
Oh, fun.

30:41.372 --> 30:43.305
<i>What are you up to?</i>

30:43.307 --> 30:46.875
<i>Oh, you know, just
hanging out by the pool.</i>

30:46.877 --> 30:48.679
- <i>Let's see.</i>
- <i>Yeah, we wanna see.</i>

30:50.780 --> 30:51.950
Okay.

30:54.951 --> 30:56.985
Girl!

30:56.987 --> 30:59.153
<i>That looks kind of desolate.</i>

30:59.155 --> 31:00.654
<i>Yikes!</i>

31:00.656 --> 31:02.359
<i>Well, it's not that bad,
right, Lily?</i>

31:03.428 --> 31:04.395
Hold on, guys.

31:07.432 --> 31:08.466
I wanna show you guys
something.

31:11.769 --> 31:14.268
<i>Is that a bunny?
Look at his nose!</i>

31:14.270 --> 31:16.004
<i>I want a bunny!</i>

31:16.006 --> 31:19.173
- Isn't she cute?
- <i>She's so cute.</i>

31:19.175 --> 31:21.142
I miss you guys.
Have fun for me.

31:21.144 --> 31:22.844
<i>What's that, Lily?</i>

31:22.846 --> 31:24.546
I can't wait for camp.

31:24.548 --> 31:26.981
<i>You're cutting out.
I didn't quite hear you.</i>

31:26.983 --> 31:28.517
- I said, I can't wait for camp.
- <i>Hello?</i>

31:32.522 --> 31:33.523
Lost them.

31:35.526 --> 31:38.526
Good girl. Want a snack?

31:38.528 --> 31:40.565
What kinda snack are you
in the mood for, Henrietta?

31:41.531 --> 31:42.766
Ice cream sandwich?

31:54.377 --> 31:55.545
Don't tell on me.

32:00.884 --> 32:02.220
I knew we had a lot in common.

32:17.567 --> 32:18.735
Hey, there.

32:20.037 --> 32:21.105
I know, I know.

32:23.907 --> 32:26.642
I came to apologize.

32:26.644 --> 32:29.180
The incident the other day
wasn't entirely your fault.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.149
I told a fib and I'm sorry.

32:33.750 --> 32:37.321
I just figured that
I'd be able to hop on and...

32:40.490 --> 32:41.925
I don't know,
be like my mom.

32:44.228 --> 32:45.430
Sorry, P.

32:46.663 --> 32:47.765
Do you forgive me?

32:53.336 --> 32:54.972
Here, brought you something.

32:58.108 --> 32:59.109
There you go.

33:00.611 --> 33:02.411
Now I know this doesn't mean
we'll be riding off

33:02.413 --> 33:05.212
into the sunset
anytime soon,

33:05.214 --> 33:07.784
but I think a little distance
between us could be good.

33:13.723 --> 33:15.292
To be honest with you,
Pistachio,

33:18.328 --> 33:19.931
I'm just not much of a rider.

33:21.898 --> 33:24.101
I'll still come down and give
you guys treats though, okay?

33:26.135 --> 33:27.137
All you guys.

33:53.663 --> 33:55.398
So what is this?

33:55.400 --> 33:58.167
We consider this our version
of the community barbecue.

33:58.169 --> 33:59.834
- With a catch.
- Yeah.

33:59.836 --> 34:02.036
Every year, the valley
gets together to raise funds

34:02.038 --> 34:04.038
for the volunteer
fire department.

34:04.040 --> 34:06.040
And one of the draws
to get folks to come out is

34:06.042 --> 34:08.876
they have our best
in riders' race.

34:08.878 --> 34:11.947
Runners and racers,
on your mark!

34:11.949 --> 34:13.282
Come on, Ava!

34:13.284 --> 34:15.117
- Get set!
- Go, Ava!

34:15.119 --> 34:16.085
Go!

34:19.724 --> 34:21.556
Who's that?

34:21.559 --> 34:22.958
Chuck Fromer's grandson.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.726
He thinks he's
a real hotshot.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.862
Pretends to be a cowboy.

34:26.864 --> 34:28.463
How do you pretend
to be a cowboy?

34:28.465 --> 34:30.931
By acting like you love
living in the countryside

34:30.934 --> 34:32.367
when you actually
hate it,

34:32.369 --> 34:34.001
only to impress
your grandfather.

34:34.003 --> 34:35.405
To ensure that
you inherit his land.

34:36.239 --> 34:37.375
Got it.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.742
So how does this work?

34:40.744 --> 34:42.577
It's called
a "Ride and Tie."

34:42.579 --> 34:43.844
<i>This is a short one,
though.</i>

34:43.847 --> 34:45.079
<i>It's only five miles.</i>

34:45.081 --> 34:46.882
Yeah, I mean,
every race is different,

34:46.884 --> 34:49.885
but usually they're
15 to 20 miles or longer.

34:49.887 --> 34:53.121
Every team has, uh,
two runners and a horse.

34:53.123 --> 34:54.789
<i>And one person starts
on the horse</i>

34:54.791 --> 34:57.191
<i>while the other follows
behind on foot.</i>

34:57.193 --> 34:59.026
Oh, like Ava?
She's running?

34:59.028 --> 35:01.929
<i>Right. So Ava will run up
to her horse tied to a tree,</i>

35:01.931 --> 35:03.499
<i>untie the horse,</i>

35:03.501 --> 35:06.233
<i>get on the horse,
then start riding.</i>

35:06.235 --> 35:10.938
Yeah. Then she'll ride up to her partner
who is up the trail now on foot.

35:10.940 --> 35:13.675
Right. Then they'll switch horses
to relieve the one running.

35:13.677 --> 35:16.077
Or they'll just keep going,
passing their partner,

35:16.079 --> 35:18.282
<i>and then tie their horse
further down the trail.</i>

35:21.719 --> 35:24.753
<i>Then the runner will
reach the horse, hop on...</i>

35:24.755 --> 35:27.755
Repeating the process
over and over again.

35:27.757 --> 35:29.525
It sounds like
a really intense race.

35:29.527 --> 35:33.561
Yeah, uh, some of the best
runners think they can handle it

35:33.563 --> 35:35.932
and then once they get out here,
they realize that they can't.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.101
Hi.

35:39.103 --> 35:41.003
Look, the first team's
coming around the corner.

35:45.675 --> 35:46.710
Come on, Ava.

35:47.844 --> 35:49.713
Come on, come on.
Oh, man!

35:53.349 --> 35:55.219
Who's her partner?
Who are we looking for?

35:56.686 --> 35:59.588
Well, it would
have been me,

35:59.590 --> 36:01.623
but I'm already committed
to another team.

36:01.625 --> 36:04.226
And ever since
Jamie's ankle surgery,

36:04.228 --> 36:06.228
Ava's been looking
for a new good partner,

36:06.230 --> 36:07.662
but she hasn't been able
to find one.

36:07.664 --> 36:10.831
So she's training
for the next big race,

36:10.833 --> 36:12.233
auditioning
new partners.

36:12.235 --> 36:13.767
Yeah, but you have
to be really in sync

36:13.769 --> 36:15.336
with your horse
and your partner.

36:15.338 --> 36:17.072
And my doctor doesn't want
me running for a while.

36:17.074 --> 36:19.139
And I decided
to sit this one out,

36:19.141 --> 36:21.976
but Ava's fierce

36:21.978 --> 36:23.512
and she never
misses a race.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.216
So she's out here
trying someone new.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.583
I see.

36:28.585 --> 36:31.119
I hope her partner didn't take
a wrong turn on the trail.

36:31.121 --> 36:32.619
What do you mean?
That can happen?

36:32.621 --> 36:34.490
Oh, yeah.

36:34.492 --> 36:37.325
I've seen people just run
directly past their horse,

36:37.327 --> 36:39.628
just to catch up to
their partner on foot,

36:39.630 --> 36:42.296
all dehydrated,
and dying, and...

36:42.298 --> 36:44.633
Yeah, that's when you know
you missed your horse.

36:44.635 --> 36:46.233
So what do you do?

36:46.235 --> 36:47.504
- You run all the way back.
- Run all the way back.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.574
Well, thanks
for inviting me, guys.

36:52.576 --> 36:54.075
Yeah, of course.

36:54.077 --> 36:55.079
There she is!

37:13.496 --> 37:15.232
You guys see her out
there, anywhere?

37:17.800 --> 37:19.103
She probably made
a wrong turn.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.396
You know what, Pistachio?

37:51.568 --> 37:52.770
I'll be right back.

37:56.639 --> 37:57.738
Hey, kid.

37:57.740 --> 37:59.240
Sam.

37:59.242 --> 38:00.974
Just the cowboy
I was looking for.

38:00.976 --> 38:03.778
- You know more than one?
- No.

38:03.780 --> 38:05.248
I kind of need your help
with something.

38:07.150 --> 38:08.152
Please.

38:09.385 --> 38:11.786
Okay.

38:11.788 --> 38:12.789
Thank you, Sam.

38:21.565 --> 38:24.032
Horses are whip-smart.

38:24.034 --> 38:27.536
And each one of 'em has
their own personality.

38:27.538 --> 38:29.537
But they're animals
that can be trained,

38:29.539 --> 38:32.541
and for the most part,
they wanna be.

38:32.543 --> 38:35.146
You remember that and
you'll be good as gold.

38:37.447 --> 38:40.014
Now, horses like
to work, too.

38:40.016 --> 38:41.983
Don't be afraid
to make 'em sweat.

38:43.853 --> 38:44.855
Good boy.

38:48.291 --> 38:49.492
Giddy up! Giddy up!

38:52.362 --> 38:53.697
Good boy.

38:56.967 --> 38:57.968
Oh!

38:58.601 --> 39:00.668
Good boy.

39:00.670 --> 39:03.972
Goal here is to keep him
physically fit

39:03.974 --> 39:06.508
and remind him what
his cues are, okay?

39:06.510 --> 39:07.678
Okay, it's your turn.

39:10.813 --> 39:12.246
Get behind him.

39:12.248 --> 39:13.782
There you go.

39:13.784 --> 39:16.284
- Good. Good boy. Easy.
- That's faster?

39:16.286 --> 39:18.121
Get down low. There
you go, drive him.

39:18.956 --> 39:20.490
Good. Good.

39:21.625 --> 39:23.728
Good job. There you go.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.760
Good.

39:26.762 --> 39:28.762
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa! Whoa!

39:28.764 --> 39:30.030
Good boy.

39:30.032 --> 39:31.201
Good job!

39:31.934 --> 39:33.635
Good boy!

39:33.637 --> 39:34.638
Good boy.

39:36.639 --> 39:38.308
You and him will be
tuned up in no time.

39:44.014 --> 39:45.282
Good job.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.957
Okay, you're a messy
baker, but that's okay.

40:04.034 --> 40:05.769
Now, come in front
of him right here.

40:09.706 --> 40:11.671
- And I just, like, mold it?
- Yeah, but don't be lazy.

40:11.673 --> 40:12.942
Just make it... Yeah.

40:15.344 --> 40:16.613
There you go,
right there.

40:19.516 --> 40:20.518
Good boy!

40:30.693 --> 40:32.226
Those look good!

40:32.228 --> 40:34.762
- Good job! Your first batch!
- Thank you.

40:34.764 --> 40:35.965
Won't be your last here.

40:38.869 --> 40:40.400
All right.

40:40.402 --> 40:41.704
Don't break your neck.

40:51.382 --> 40:52.947
Pull your left rein,
left rein.

40:52.949 --> 40:53.951
- Now, "Whoa."
- Whoa.

40:55.219 --> 40:56.186
Good boy.

41:05.829 --> 41:07.162
Thanks, Aunt Glo.

41:07.164 --> 41:08.963
Oh, you're welcome.

41:08.965 --> 41:12.467
- You're a really good cook.
- Oh, thank you.

41:12.469 --> 41:14.401
- Yeah, thank you, Glo.
- You're welcome.

41:14.403 --> 41:16.905
If you guys don't mind, I'm
gonna try and call my dad.

41:16.907 --> 41:17.908
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

41:20.777 --> 41:23.947
So, what's the deal
with Lily's dad?

41:27.217 --> 41:30.918
Ever since my sister died,
he hasn't been the same.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.421
Uses work as a distraction.

41:33.423 --> 41:36.494
I think he's having a really hard time
keeping it together, to be honest.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.595
- Right there to...
- Okay. Yeah. All right.

41:41.597 --> 41:43.331
Excuse me one
second, okay?

41:43.333 --> 41:44.798
- All right.
- Okay.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.467
<i>You seeing me yet?</i>

41:46.469 --> 41:47.836
- Dad?
- <i>Lily?</i>

41:47.838 --> 41:49.202
Dad!

41:49.204 --> 41:51.606
Hey! How are you?

41:51.608 --> 41:53.108
<i>Listen, I'm at
a job site, okay?</i>

41:53.110 --> 41:54.608
- So if I lose you, don't...
- <i>Dad.</i>

41:54.610 --> 41:56.278
Yeah?

41:56.280 --> 41:57.813
<i>How's the whole
Aunt Glo experiment going?</i>

41:57.815 --> 41:59.548
- <i>Is she keeping you busy?</i>
- Yes.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.148
You're never going
to believe it,

42:01.150 --> 42:02.818
but I've actually been taking
riding lessons,

42:02.820 --> 42:04.488
and today I learned how to...

42:05.889 --> 42:07.121
Dad, can you
still see me?

42:07.123 --> 42:08.222
<i>Honey?</i>

42:08.224 --> 42:10.458
- Hello?
- <i>Hey...</i>

42:10.460 --> 42:12.459
You're cutting out.

42:12.461 --> 42:14.461
- <i>Lily?</i>
- Still see me?

42:14.463 --> 42:16.063
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Dad?

42:16.065 --> 42:17.697
- Honey?
- William.

42:17.699 --> 42:19.800
- Yeah, hold... Honey? I'm...
- We're finishing.

42:19.802 --> 42:21.869
- William, come on.
- Okay, all right.

42:21.871 --> 42:23.474
Sorry about that.

42:24.842 --> 42:25.843
Sorry.

42:35.485 --> 42:39.554
What did happen to your sister,
if you don't mind me asking?

42:39.556 --> 42:41.322
Brain aneurysm.

42:41.324 --> 42:44.157
And she was actually out
on a ride.

42:44.159 --> 42:46.860
And Lily was only one.

42:46.862 --> 42:48.496
He answered,
but the call dropped.

42:48.498 --> 42:50.499
I think he was headed
into a meeting or something.

42:50.501 --> 42:52.767
Oh, honey, he'll call you
when he can chat.

42:52.769 --> 42:55.836
I know. I think I'm gonna
go to bed, if that's okay.

42:55.838 --> 42:58.005
- Sure.
- All right. Good night.

42:58.007 --> 42:59.909
- Good night. See you in the morning.
- Good night.

43:04.882 --> 43:05.883
Quite the kid.

43:06.516 --> 43:07.715
She is.

43:07.717 --> 43:09.083
Hope her father knows that.

43:09.085 --> 43:10.320
Oh, he knows.

43:11.188 --> 43:12.552
He does.

43:12.554 --> 43:14.688
I think that's part
of the problem.

43:14.690 --> 43:17.592
He feels like he has to
provide for her whole future

43:17.594 --> 43:20.996
all in one year,
so he works a lot.

43:20.998 --> 43:22.398
But they'll get
through it.

43:24.601 --> 43:26.101
Would you like dessert?

43:26.103 --> 43:28.168
I'm full as a tick.

43:28.170 --> 43:30.807
"Full as a tick"? That doesn't
seem like you'd be very full.

43:48.391 --> 43:49.393
Aunt Glo?

43:50.693 --> 43:51.695
What are you doing?

43:52.461 --> 43:54.329
Huh?

43:54.331 --> 43:56.300
I mean, I know what you're doing,
but, what exactly are you doing?

43:57.266 --> 43:59.566
Exercising my brain.

43:59.568 --> 44:02.135
Well, teaching my brain
to relax.

44:02.137 --> 44:05.572
Ever since I started meditating,
I have been calmer, healthier,

44:05.574 --> 44:07.277
and more at peace.

44:09.179 --> 44:10.213
Do you wanna try it?

44:11.014 --> 44:12.947
Here, have a seat.

44:12.949 --> 44:14.414
Sit up straight.
Good job.

44:14.416 --> 44:16.517
You have good posture.
And then do that.

44:16.519 --> 44:20.121
Kind of relax your
hands, close your eyes.

44:20.123 --> 44:22.590
And the first thing is
just let it go

44:22.592 --> 44:23.961
and relax your body.

44:25.728 --> 44:30.231
Next, you wanna repeat
a phrase over and over,

44:30.233 --> 44:33.233
something that's really
meaningful to your heart.

44:33.235 --> 44:35.737
Like <i>"Carpe diem"?</i>

44:35.739 --> 44:37.405
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

44:37.407 --> 44:39.376
Or you could try one
of my favorites.

44:42.277 --> 44:45.782
Inner stillness is the
key to outer strength.

44:49.652 --> 44:52.489
Inner stillness is the key
to outer strength.

44:54.623 --> 44:56.891
And that's it? I just keep
repeating it over and over?

44:56.893 --> 44:59.193
Yeah, keep
repeating it.

44:59.195 --> 45:00.697
It's easier
than it sounds.

45:03.733 --> 45:06.168
The key is not to let
your mind wander.

45:06.170 --> 45:09.005
So if you do,
just take a deep breath

45:10.072 --> 45:11.942
and continue repeating.

45:20.217 --> 45:23.887
<i>Inner stillness is
the key to outer strength.</i>

45:40.402 --> 45:43.439
<i>The key is not to let
your mind wander.</i>

46:00.891 --> 46:03.124
I don't know how you can
do that for so long.

46:03.126 --> 46:04.425
Practice.

46:04.427 --> 46:06.927
Lots and lots
of practice.

46:06.929 --> 46:09.396
Well, I see why you live out
here in the countryside.

46:09.398 --> 46:11.066
Why is that?

46:11.068 --> 46:13.534
'Cause I could hear things
I haven't heard before.

46:13.536 --> 46:15.536
Ah! Yes, it's true.

46:17.239 --> 46:20.307
Come on, let's get some breakfast.
You ready?

46:20.309 --> 46:23.478
Remember, you're in charge,
not him.

46:23.480 --> 46:27.113
Just give him his cues
and he'll listen to you.

46:27.115 --> 46:28.282
Won't you, buddy?

46:32.355 --> 46:33.322
Yee-haw!

47:24.706 --> 47:27.008
So? How was it?

47:27.010 --> 47:29.276
Not good.

47:29.278 --> 47:33.113
Are you kidding me? I'm already
wondering when we can go again.

47:33.115 --> 47:35.184
- Good job, boy.
- Okay. All right, let's go.

48:16.025 --> 48:17.992
Okay, just do it.

48:17.994 --> 48:19.463
Oh, my God.

48:24.099 --> 48:27.534
I think I know what you're
doing, but I'm not sure.

48:27.536 --> 48:30.405
I'm like the only person on
the squad who can't do one.

48:30.407 --> 48:32.039
What, a back handspring?

48:32.041 --> 48:33.043
Yeah.

48:34.043 --> 48:36.177
Well, let me spot you.

48:36.179 --> 48:38.045
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

48:38.047 --> 48:40.048
- Don't mind?
- No, come on.

48:40.050 --> 48:41.315
- All right. Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

48:41.317 --> 48:42.416
- All right.
- Go.

48:42.418 --> 48:43.686
- Okay.
- And go!

48:47.090 --> 48:49.055
- There you go! See?
- Thank you.

48:49.057 --> 48:51.659
Too bad you're not gonna be
there all the time to spot me.

48:51.661 --> 48:53.427
I mean, I'm sure
you'll get there.

48:53.429 --> 48:54.929
Have no doubt.

48:54.931 --> 48:56.365
Especially after
seeing you ride.

48:58.068 --> 48:59.736
Have you been
spying on me?

49:01.538 --> 49:02.639
No.

49:03.438 --> 49:04.641
Maybe.

49:05.809 --> 49:07.110
Accidentally.

49:08.945 --> 49:10.478
Okay.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.045
Actually, I'm here

49:12.047 --> 49:14.517
because I think you can
help me with something.

49:15.650 --> 49:17.485
Okay, what?

49:17.487 --> 49:20.324
Not actually for me,
it's for someone else.

49:21.891 --> 49:23.758
- Okay.
- Yeah.

49:23.760 --> 49:26.459
You know how Ava has been looking
for a new partner to ride with?

49:26.461 --> 49:27.961
Yeah.

49:27.963 --> 49:30.967
Well, I think
I have an idea.

49:41.244 --> 49:44.778
Okay, first clue. "I
fly high, I fly low,

49:44.780 --> 49:48.282
"but there's only one place
I really like to go."

49:48.284 --> 49:50.251
Why are we
doing this again?

49:50.253 --> 49:52.356
To prove to Ava she's not the
only queen bee around here.

49:53.322 --> 49:54.655
Oh, right.

49:54.657 --> 49:56.324
I'm in.

49:56.326 --> 49:59.161
All right. First one back with
both cards is the winner.

49:59.829 --> 50:01.561
Riders?

50:01.563 --> 50:03.563
Pistachio, we can do this.

50:03.565 --> 50:04.831
On your marks.

50:04.833 --> 50:06.300
You and me, boy.

50:06.302 --> 50:07.504
Get set.

50:08.503 --> 50:09.505
Ride!

50:17.480 --> 50:18.815
Come on, boy.

50:20.650 --> 50:21.651
There it is!

50:23.786 --> 50:25.088
Whoa.

50:28.490 --> 50:29.492
We got it.

50:35.164 --> 50:36.798
Hey, are you okay?

50:36.800 --> 50:39.633
Yeah, I'm good.
I just...

50:39.635 --> 50:42.269
I hit my head coming in
on that branch.

50:42.271 --> 50:43.838
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

50:43.840 --> 50:46.742
- Just be lucky it's not a beehive.
- Yeah.

50:48.143 --> 50:49.578
Why, are you allergic?

50:50.679 --> 50:51.981
Something like that.

50:54.518 --> 50:57.184
All right, let's get on
with it.

50:57.186 --> 50:59.454
Well, if you want, we can
do the rest of it together.

50:59.456 --> 51:03.222
What, and miss the
opportunity of beating you?

51:03.224 --> 51:06.862
Well, I would rather do that and
let you win than go it alone.

51:08.030 --> 51:09.231
Where's the fun in that?

51:31.853 --> 51:33.220
Whoa.

51:33.222 --> 51:35.421
Did we win? Did we beat her?

51:35.423 --> 51:38.427
We thought you kind of fell and
bonked your head or something.

51:42.231 --> 51:44.398
Very funny, guys.

51:44.400 --> 51:46.833
So you really think
she can handle it, huh?

51:46.835 --> 51:49.903
I think she'd make a great partner,
especially with Pistachio.

51:49.905 --> 51:52.005
Yeah,
not only is Pistachio a gem,

51:52.007 --> 51:54.208
but Lily can probably
ride just as fast

51:54.210 --> 51:55.579
or even faster
than you, Ava.

51:56.778 --> 51:57.780
Hey, now.

52:00.849 --> 52:02.118
I'll think about it.

52:08.925 --> 52:10.327
Oh...

52:11.092 --> 52:12.793
Nice.

52:12.795 --> 52:13.961
Nice.

52:13.963 --> 52:14.965
Gotcha!

52:18.501 --> 52:21.101
Both shoes. Okay.

52:21.103 --> 52:23.804
You know you have to ask
my permission first, right?

52:23.806 --> 52:26.108
I may not wanna be in a race
or be somebody's partner.

52:31.648 --> 52:33.780
It would be kind of fun,
though, huh, boy?

52:33.782 --> 52:35.083
To do a Ride and Tie?

52:39.088 --> 52:41.255
I don't wanna come out.
I feel really weird.

52:41.257 --> 52:42.659
Let me see it.

52:43.826 --> 52:44.827
Please?

52:48.398 --> 52:52.298
Oh! You look so beautiful.

52:52.300 --> 52:53.967
I don't know. Do you really
think that Ava and Max

52:53.969 --> 52:55.302
are actually gonna wear
something like this?

52:55.304 --> 52:58.505
Oh yeah. I mean,
you'd be surprised.

52:58.507 --> 53:00.608
Honestly, I think if you don't
wear something like that,

53:00.610 --> 53:02.943
you're gonna really feel
out of place.

53:02.945 --> 53:04.881
- Really?
- You'll see.

53:06.681 --> 53:08.816
I don't know.
I feel really weird.

53:08.818 --> 53:10.287
You look so cute.

53:16.559 --> 53:18.827
My goodness, you remind
me so much of her.

53:20.329 --> 53:22.998
She's so proud of you.
You know that?

53:25.235 --> 53:27.534
- Thanks, Aunt Glo.
- You're welcome.

53:27.536 --> 53:29.403
Okay, let's go finish
getting ready.

53:29.405 --> 53:31.408
I gotta go put on
my dress!

53:40.315 --> 53:43.349
You look so cute. Hi!

53:43.351 --> 53:47.354
- Evening, Glo. So nice to see you!
- It's so good to see you.

53:47.356 --> 53:49.490
My darling.
Hi, darling.

53:49.492 --> 53:51.057
Ain't she precious?
Precious, precious.

53:51.059 --> 53:53.059
- She's a hugger.
- Very nice to meet you.

53:53.061 --> 53:54.597
- Same here.
- This is so great!

53:55.797 --> 53:57.530
We have a big turnout.

53:57.532 --> 53:58.965

54:21.423 --> 54:23.557
- Hi.
- Hey.

54:23.559 --> 54:26.394
- Hi!
- Well, look at you!

54:26.396 --> 54:29.130
You're really part
of the club now.

54:29.132 --> 54:31.735
Thanks, the club that I
didn't know existed.

54:34.771 --> 54:36.273
All right. Well, I'm
gonna go dance.

54:38.407 --> 54:40.809
- She knows what she wants.
- Yeah.

54:43.813 --> 54:46.045
- Glad you came.
- Thanks.

54:46.047 --> 54:48.449
I mean, it's a different
crowd, it's a little older.

54:48.451 --> 54:53.253
But it's tradition
and we like to play along.

54:53.255 --> 54:55.824
To be honest, I didn't know that
things like this still existed.

54:56.893 --> 54:57.894
Well...

55:03.565 --> 55:05.700
You wanna dance?

55:05.702 --> 55:09.235
Okay, but I'm warning you now, I
do not know how to square dance.

55:09.237 --> 55:11.438
Yeah, I'm sure, 'cause a
cheerleader couldn't keep up.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.972
I can't.

55:12.974 --> 55:14.374
Well, Max.

55:14.376 --> 55:18.012
You sure clean up nice.

55:18.014 --> 55:19.646
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Well, you're welcome.

55:19.648 --> 55:21.315
You can call me Glo.

55:21.317 --> 55:22.619
Well, have fun dancing.

55:24.320 --> 55:27.621
Guys, come on.
Get in here.

55:27.623 --> 55:28.956

I remember
being that young.

55:57.987 --> 56:01.854
Chuck, I told you.
I'm not budging.

56:01.856 --> 56:03.726
That easement isn't yours
and you know it.

56:05.161 --> 56:07.628
You know, you city folks
kill me.

56:07.630 --> 56:09.262
You're all the same.

56:09.264 --> 56:11.132
Move out here to the country
and you just think overnight

56:11.134 --> 56:12.635
you just know
how everything works.

56:15.304 --> 56:16.306
Hey!

56:20.876 --> 56:22.545
My grandsons
wanna meet you.

56:23.512 --> 56:24.847
Okay.

56:25.514 --> 56:26.914
Hi.

56:26.916 --> 56:28.715
We have a proposition
for you, Miss...

56:28.717 --> 56:31.086
Beecham. Gloria Beecham.

56:36.324 --> 56:38.224
Nice to meet you.

56:38.226 --> 56:41.195
My two grandsons are pretty
keen on one of your horses.

56:41.197 --> 56:43.532
Yeah, that nice
chestnut-looking one.

56:44.532 --> 56:47.101
Pistachio? Hmm.

56:47.103 --> 56:49.836
So are you all stalking me
and my horses?

56:49.838 --> 56:51.905
Pretty sure you can go
to jail for that.

56:51.907 --> 56:53.206
Really?

56:53.208 --> 56:54.411
Jail for what?

56:55.644 --> 56:57.010
Hey.

56:57.012 --> 56:58.345
You boys harassing
my friends again?

56:58.347 --> 56:59.746
Not at all.

56:59.748 --> 57:02.251
We are just offering
a neighborly opportunity.

57:03.353 --> 57:05.318
With a bet.

57:05.320 --> 57:07.722
Who doesn't like a little
bit of opportunity?

57:07.724 --> 57:10.557
It's real simple, Gloria.
I mean, we can do this clean

57:10.559 --> 57:13.726
or else I can call my lawyer,
and we can do it that way.

57:13.728 --> 57:15.329
Oh. You have a lawyer?

57:15.331 --> 57:18.034
Well, big whoop.
So does everyone else I know.

57:19.568 --> 57:21.769
- "Big whoop"?
- Yeah, big whoop.

57:21.771 --> 57:25.773
Well, I'm sorry we couldn't
settle this amicably,

57:25.775 --> 57:28.278
but I will be looking forward
to all that paperwork.

57:33.114 --> 57:34.450
Just ignore him.

57:37.286 --> 57:39.318
Double or nothing!

57:39.320 --> 57:41.657
Lily! No,
don't. Lily!

57:44.092 --> 57:46.260
You heard me.

57:46.262 --> 57:48.929
Well, what exactly are we
betting on, sweetheart?

57:48.931 --> 57:52.132
Your two grandsons against Ava and
I in our own Ride and Tie race.

57:52.134 --> 57:55.401
And if we win,
the easement is hers.

57:55.403 --> 57:59.740
And when we win, the
easement's ours, forever.

57:59.742 --> 58:01.441
As well as
that horse we like.

58:01.443 --> 58:03.244
- And a horse of yours that she likes.
- No, Lily...

58:03.246 --> 58:04.247
Deal.

58:06.581 --> 58:08.116
No, Lily, don't! Lily!

58:09.550 --> 58:10.519
Deal.

58:13.789 --> 58:15.758
Pleasure doing business
with you.

58:19.795 --> 58:21.094
What?

58:21.096 --> 58:23.095
We can beat them.

58:23.097 --> 58:24.632
Erm...

58:24.634 --> 58:27.367
Yeah. Yes,
we will beat them.

58:27.369 --> 58:28.371
We can beat them.

58:30.539 --> 58:33.641
I wanna ask you, are sure you
wanna go with Pistachio?

58:33.643 --> 58:37.144
- I'm game to try your horse.
- Yeah. Are you kidding me?

58:37.146 --> 58:41.048
Between you, me and P, we have
the ace team I've always wanted.

58:41.050 --> 58:43.115
It seems like you've been training
for this your whole life.

58:43.117 --> 58:44.650
He's a natural.

58:44.652 --> 58:46.052
You hear that, P?

58:46.054 --> 58:47.056
You're a natural.

58:52.894 --> 58:54.394
Pass it through.

58:54.396 --> 58:55.963
- Okay.
- Okay?

58:55.965 --> 58:56.929
And this is your
horse's head, right?

58:56.931 --> 58:58.233
So, safe.

59:00.168 --> 59:01.467
- Almost.
- No?

59:01.469 --> 59:03.336
- Okay. Here.
- Okay, okay.

59:03.338 --> 59:04.938
Up over yourself, okay?

59:04.940 --> 59:05.908
Go!

59:09.644 --> 59:13.682
This trail here that you see on
the map is this trail right here.

59:26.396 --> 59:28.061
- Add the tail.
- This?

59:28.063 --> 59:29.065
- Yeah.
- Or this?

59:31.199 --> 59:32.365
Hi, buddy!

59:33.436 --> 59:35.204
So you like kind
of like the...

59:39.041 --> 59:40.874
You first.

59:40.876 --> 59:41.878
You got it!

59:47.382 --> 59:49.516
Yes, I know that.

59:49.518 --> 59:52.120
You still have one hand
on one side and one hand...

59:57.260 --> 59:58.891
All right, hang on, hang on.
Oh, God!

59:58.893 --> 01:00:01.396
Oh, God, I actually
think I'm dying.

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:05.535
Oh, no!

01:00:07.869 --> 01:00:09.869
Okay, you gotta stretch.

01:00:09.871 --> 01:00:11.707
I don't think doing the splits
is part of the competition.

01:00:13.742 --> 01:00:15.909
What do you think
we do as cheerleaders?

01:00:15.911 --> 01:00:18.845
Do you think we just jump
up and down, and do dances?

01:00:18.847 --> 01:00:21.048
We run. We run every day.

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:24.684
I never got to be a cheerleader
or a dancer or any of that.

01:00:24.686 --> 01:00:26.088
Would you have wanted to?

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:28.858
Kind of.

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:30.460
Really?

01:00:32.827 --> 01:00:34.927
I mean, why couldn't
you do it?

01:00:34.929 --> 01:00:36.597
You strike me as the type that
could do whatever you want to.

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:38.298
Please.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.400
I can't do
whatever I want.

01:00:40.402 --> 01:00:43.302
I work for everything that I
have, before and after school.

01:00:43.304 --> 01:00:45.307
And everything that I have is
just so I can do more work.

01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:49.675
I always thought
you didn't like me

01:00:49.677 --> 01:00:51.213
'cause you thought
you were better than me.

01:00:53.315 --> 01:00:55.583
No, I...

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:57.519
I was mean to you because
I'm jealous of you.

01:01:00.322 --> 01:01:02.322
You get to live
near the city.

01:01:02.324 --> 01:01:06.459
And go to movies and drive-throughs,
and be a cheerleader.

01:01:06.461 --> 01:01:10.264
And I bet you never smell
like horse manure.

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:13.233
Yeah, and I have a dad who works
so much he forgets about me,

01:01:13.235 --> 01:01:16.338
and friends who totally forget I exist
when I don't have cell service.

01:01:17.972 --> 01:01:19.442
Not all your friends.

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:23.978
Thank you, Ava.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.313
Thank you for helping me
do all this.

01:01:26.514 --> 01:01:28.182
It really means a lot.

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.450
I really wanna win this.

01:01:30.452 --> 01:01:32.155
I really wanna win this
for Aunt Glo.

01:01:33.021 --> 01:01:34.822
No problem.

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:37.260
Any chance to beat those
Fromer boys, I'm down.

01:01:39.061 --> 01:01:40.526
All right,
start stretching.

01:01:40.528 --> 01:01:41.931
- Okay.
- Cheerleader.

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:45.865
I can stretch.

01:01:45.867 --> 01:01:47.235
- I can stretch like...
- Touch your toes.

01:01:48.869 --> 01:01:50.172
That hurts.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.909
<i>Hey, it's me.
I'm not here right now.</i>

01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:57.378
<i>Leave a message and I'll
get right back to you.</i>

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.381
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.548
Hey, Dad. It's Lily. Um...

01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:06.019
So I have this really big race
coming up next week

01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:08.956
and I know you're probably
not gonna be able to make it,

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:12.659
but I just thought I should
at least tell you about it.

01:02:12.661 --> 01:02:18.731
And I wanted to say thank you
for everything you do for me

01:02:18.733 --> 01:02:21.203
and everything you do
to keep our house running.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:23.840
I really appreciate it.

01:02:26.974 --> 01:02:28.277
And I really miss you.

01:02:30.846 --> 01:02:33.081
Okay. I love you.

01:02:34.416 --> 01:02:35.418
Bye.

01:02:46.894 --> 01:02:48.097
Pistachio!

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.568
Oh, no, boy.
What's the matter?

01:02:58.072 --> 01:02:59.341
Aunt Glo!

01:03:00.074 --> 01:03:02.142
Aunt Glo!

01:03:02.144 --> 01:03:03.943
There's something wrong
with Pistachio.

01:03:03.945 --> 01:03:05.711
- Oh, dear!
- He looks really bad.

01:03:05.713 --> 01:03:07.280
Okay.

01:03:07.282 --> 01:03:09.016
Sam's not here.
What are we gonna do?

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:11.286
Well, we're probably gonna
have to call the vet.

01:03:13.188 --> 01:03:14.590
I'm gonna call him.

01:03:24.465 --> 01:03:26.768
I understand. Thank you.
All right, bye-bye.

01:03:28.369 --> 01:03:30.871
He said it's not gonna be
for a couple of hours.

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:32.438
We can't wait that long.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.442
Well...

01:03:39.481 --> 01:03:40.780
Hello.

01:03:40.782 --> 01:03:43.349
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:03:43.351 --> 01:03:45.818
All right, get him up. Whatever
you do, keep him moving.

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.586
I'll be right there.

01:03:47.588 --> 01:03:49.289
Ava's on her way.

01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:50.324
She said no matter what,
we have to keep him moving.

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:51.561
We can't let him
lie down.

01:04:00.768 --> 01:04:03.202
All right. All right,
good boy. Come on.

01:04:03.204 --> 01:04:04.637
Good, you're up.

01:04:04.639 --> 01:04:06.373
You're up walking.
Come here, you.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.110
Good boy. Come here.

01:04:13.514 --> 01:04:17.519
You're able to walk. Good boy!
Look at you walking.

01:04:21.155 --> 01:04:24.994
Good boy! Yep, you're up walking.
Look at you!

01:04:44.012 --> 01:04:45.545
Hey, guys.

01:04:45.547 --> 01:04:46.847
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:47.981
Hi, buddy.

01:04:47.983 --> 01:04:49.619
Gotta check his color.

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:55.889
Gotta listen for some
gut sounds.

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:58.224
How long till
the vet gets here?

01:04:58.226 --> 01:05:00.526
All right, he's gotta have
Banamine now. Okay?

01:05:00.528 --> 01:05:03.262
Good boy. Good, good...
Good boy, good boy.

01:05:03.264 --> 01:05:06.166
There you go,
very good boy.

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.601
Good boy. Hey, hey.

01:05:08.603 --> 01:05:10.470
It's all right.

01:05:10.472 --> 01:05:12.170
It's all right. Hey.

01:05:12.172 --> 01:05:13.541
It's okay, buddy.

01:05:15.643 --> 01:05:16.778
Thanks.

01:05:41.869 --> 01:05:43.637
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:47.941
Thank you so much. His breathing
is labored and he won't eat.

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:50.346
- How long has he been like this?
- Well, about four hours.

01:05:58.286 --> 01:06:00.253
It's all we can
do for now.

01:06:00.255 --> 01:06:02.988
It's best to go inside
and get some rest.

01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:04.592
All we can do is wait.

01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:19.507
Hey,
it's gonna be okay.

01:06:21.443 --> 01:06:24.110
What are the chances that
he's not gonna make it?

01:06:24.112 --> 01:06:27.113
It's hard to say. It's a
really bad case of colic.

01:06:27.115 --> 01:06:30.717
Please, Doc, I cannot have
her lose anyone else.

01:06:30.719 --> 01:06:34.123
If you could do whatever you need
to do to save him, please do it.

01:06:38.893 --> 01:06:41.594
Give me a call
in three hours.

01:06:41.596 --> 01:06:43.829
- We should know more by then.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:06:43.831 --> 01:06:46.298
- I appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.700
I think she's gonna
wanna spend the night here.

01:06:48.702 --> 01:06:50.072
Yeah.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.409
I'm gonna go grab
some blankets.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:57.811
How you doing?

01:06:57.813 --> 01:07:01.481
- I'm tired.
- Yeah.

01:07:01.483 --> 01:07:04.383
I think I'm gonna go home
and try to get some sleep.

01:07:04.385 --> 01:07:05.818
You should, too.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:08.021
I'll try.

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:10.324
No, seriously,
thank you for coming.

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:12.325
He wouldn't be doing this
good if it weren't for you.

01:07:12.327 --> 01:07:15.297
He's gonna be okay.
Call me first thing?

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:17.199
I will.

01:07:37.652 --> 01:07:39.188
Please get better.

01:07:50.264 --> 01:07:52.365
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:07:52.367 --> 01:07:54.700
He's gonna be okay.

01:07:54.702 --> 01:07:55.938
I hope so.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.277
Do you remember when you asked
me how he got his name?

01:08:03.711 --> 01:08:05.581
Well, I didn't name him.

01:08:07.882 --> 01:08:12.488
He had a previous owner
before me, a much better one.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.693
When your mom was pregnant
with you,

01:08:21.694 --> 01:08:25.201
your dad used to call you
his little peanut.

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:31.004
Your mom was afraid
that nickname would stick,

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:35.207
so she wanted to change it.
And she said,

01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:38.078
"She's so much more special
than a peanut.

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:41.582
"She's a pistachio."

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:49.692
And Pistachio's mom was pregnant
the same time your mom was.

01:08:50.591 --> 01:08:52.627
And that was Misty.

01:08:54.429 --> 01:09:00.232
Misty was her favorite.
He was her best friend.

01:09:00.234 --> 01:09:03.104
<i>They were together
all the time.</i>

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:10.609
I remember seeing them at
the barn, under the mists,

01:09:10.612 --> 01:09:12.611
cooling off, because
they were both pregnant

01:09:12.613 --> 01:09:13.982
in the middle of summer.

01:09:14.814 --> 01:09:16.184
Pistachio came first.

01:09:19.386 --> 01:09:22.992
<i>And your mom, she was right
there with Misty, helping her.</i>

01:09:24.591 --> 01:09:28.761
And from the time
Pistachio was born

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:31.430
to the first time
he took his first trot,

01:09:31.432 --> 01:09:34.166
your mom helped
Misty with him.

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:36.171
And then you were born.

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:42.241
Misty knew how important
you were to your mom.

01:09:45.979 --> 01:09:49.318
<i>And your mom knew how important
Pistachio was to her.</i>

01:09:54.154 --> 01:09:56.024
It's a neat story, huh?

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:03.532
Thank you.

01:10:04.364 --> 01:10:05.833
You're welcome.

01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:26.654
Please, boy, get better.

01:10:28.222 --> 01:10:29.324
Please.

01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:45.370
Looks like he pulled it
through just fine.

01:10:45.372 --> 01:10:47.674
Yes, he did.

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:50.476
- Every night, in his grain.
- Okay, thank you.

01:10:50.478 --> 01:10:52.446
Does this mean
that he's gonna be okay?

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:53.449
Yeah.

01:10:58.552 --> 01:10:59.721
Thank you.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:05.394
Hey.

01:11:11.699 --> 01:11:13.031
Hi.

01:11:13.033 --> 01:11:15.067
Hi, buddy. Hey.

01:11:15.069 --> 01:11:17.970
Yes. Hello.

01:11:17.972 --> 01:11:19.608
Hi, you're
looking good.

01:11:21.476 --> 01:11:22.974
Do you think he's okay
to race?

01:11:22.976 --> 01:11:24.577
Yeah, I think so.

01:11:24.579 --> 01:11:27.548
Once the colic passes,
he should be good to go.

01:11:30.518 --> 01:11:32.552
You mind telling me
what's going on?

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.789
Why you've been so
worried about something?

01:11:37.792 --> 01:11:41.764
Lily didn't bet just the
easement, she bet Pistachio.

01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:44.865
And he was my sister's.

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:47.299
It took me five years
to get this horse back,

01:11:47.301 --> 01:11:52.907
and I'm afraid if Pistachio doesn't
win, Chuck is not gonna let this go.

01:11:54.341 --> 01:11:58.346
And losing Pistachio
could just...

01:11:59.847 --> 01:12:01.680
Hey.

01:12:01.682 --> 01:12:03.449
They're not gonna lose.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.753
- He looks better.
- Yeah.

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:08.420
You ready?

01:12:08.422 --> 01:12:10.290
- I guess.
- Yeah?

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:11.657
Think so.

01:12:11.659 --> 01:12:12.825
- Are you ready?
- Are you ready?

01:12:12.827 --> 01:12:13.862
Jinx.

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:31.680
Hey. Ride him like
you stole him.

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.349
Okay.

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:36.518
Dad!

01:12:41.456 --> 01:12:43.790
Our two teams
at the starting line.

01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:49.495
Riders and runners,
at your mark.

01:12:49.497 --> 01:12:51.296
Come on, Lily!

01:12:51.298 --> 01:12:52.533
You got this, Ava!

01:12:54.469 --> 01:12:55.636
We got this.

01:12:57.204 --> 01:12:59.004
Get set!

01:12:59.006 --> 01:13:00.108
You got this, Lily!

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:01.877
Go!

01:13:15.689 --> 01:13:18.525
- Come on, Lily!
- Come on, Pistachio!

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:19.592
You got this!

01:13:19.594 --> 01:13:20.762
Come on, Lily!

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:45.020
Where is Gil?

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.823
Hi, there.

01:14:23.557 --> 01:14:24.760
Hey, boy.

01:14:26.994 --> 01:14:28.928
Slow and steady wins the race.

01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:30.729
Say that to yourself,
sweetheart.

01:14:30.731 --> 01:14:32.734
You'll be losing that pretty
little horse of yours.

01:14:39.439 --> 01:14:41.074
What did you say?

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.541
What, your aunt didn't
tell you?

01:14:43.543 --> 01:14:45.314
Pistachio's the horse
we get when we win.

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:49.451
Best be careful
what you bet next time.

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:53.288
Ha! Yeah,
Giddy up! Giddy up!

01:14:55.155 --> 01:14:56.291
Come on. Come on, boy.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.692
Good job, Lily.

01:15:33.694 --> 01:15:34.862
Go, Lily!

01:15:35.596 --> 01:15:37.129
Good job.

01:15:37.131 --> 01:15:38.964
Hey, hey, hey.
Take the hilly path.

01:15:38.966 --> 01:15:40.767
- We can do that?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:42.300
That side, it's easier
but it's longer.

01:15:42.302 --> 01:15:44.603
That side, it's steeper
but it's shorter.

01:15:44.605 --> 01:15:45.573
Go, Lily, go!

01:16:11.498 --> 01:16:13.100
We're almost there, P.

01:16:20.675 --> 01:16:21.877
All right, brave up.

01:16:31.018 --> 01:16:33.121
All right, bud.
I think we're in the lead.

01:16:34.988 --> 01:16:37.959
Let's go, buddy. All right.
You ready? We gotta go.

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:46.232
Oh, no.

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:48.601
Oh, no. Oh, no.
All right, bud, we gotta go.

01:16:48.603 --> 01:16:50.204
We gotta go, we gotta go.

01:16:57.078 --> 01:16:58.146
Lily?

01:16:59.412 --> 01:17:01.148
Lily, I need help!

01:17:04.851 --> 01:17:07.753
- Are you okay? What happened?
- I got stung.

01:17:07.755 --> 01:17:09.821
What do you mean?
Do you have a pen?

01:17:09.823 --> 01:17:11.790
No, no. My mom has it at the finish.
I didn't bring it with me.

01:17:11.792 --> 01:17:13.893
Okay, don't worry about that.
You need to go get help.

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:16.595
What? No. We have to finish.
Come on, you can get on.

01:17:16.597 --> 01:17:18.498
He's faster with one.
You have to go.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.670
- Lily, we'll lose! If it's...
- Just go! You're gonna die.

01:17:24.305 --> 01:17:25.771
Go!

01:17:25.773 --> 01:17:29.675
Pistachio, listen, boy,
you've done so good,

01:17:29.677 --> 01:17:31.677
but Ava needs you
right now, okay?

01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:33.946
Go, boy! Go home!

01:17:33.948 --> 01:17:35.317
Go home!

01:17:52.766 --> 01:17:54.469
You should have stayed
in the city, little girl.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.946
I see someone.

01:18:07.948 --> 01:18:09.017
Something's wrong.

01:18:11.918 --> 01:18:13.152
I got stung!

01:18:13.154 --> 01:18:15.223
Hurry! She needs help!

01:18:24.198 --> 01:18:26.401
- Mom!
- I got you, honey. I got you, honey.

01:18:28.802 --> 01:18:30.535
You're gonna be okay.

01:18:38.378 --> 01:18:39.381
Go, buddy.

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:44.418
Go, Pistachio, go!

01:18:45.819 --> 01:18:49.157
Go, Pistachio.
Go! Go, get Lily!

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:16.952
Pistachio?

01:19:34.234 --> 01:19:35.336
Pistachio.

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:38.673
You came back.

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:44.445
Come on, buddy, let's go.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.015
Yee-haw.

01:19:49.216 --> 01:19:50.484
I see someone.

01:19:55.789 --> 01:19:58.025
No, it's the boys.

01:20:04.097 --> 01:20:06.264
Did you see 'em
stutter step?

01:20:06.266 --> 01:20:07.368
It was great.

01:20:07.935 --> 01:20:09.500
Wait!

01:20:09.502 --> 01:20:11.470
That's her!

01:20:11.472 --> 01:20:13.438
- It's Lily! It's Lily!
- That's her, right? Yeah?

01:20:28.789 --> 01:20:30.589
- Come on, Lily!
- You got this, honey!

01:20:30.591 --> 01:20:32.157
That's it, Lily!

01:20:32.159 --> 01:20:34.259
- Hey, Lily, come on!
- Come on, let's go!

01:20:34.261 --> 01:20:36.294
Go, Lily, go!

01:20:36.296 --> 01:20:37.595
Go! Go!

01:20:37.597 --> 01:20:38.964
Whoo!

01:20:38.966 --> 01:20:40.634
- You got this!
- Come on!

01:20:41.735 --> 01:20:42.770
Lily, go!

01:20:43.503 --> 01:20:44.506
Go!

01:20:54.247 --> 01:20:56.150
Good job, Lily!

01:20:57.917 --> 01:20:59.019
Yeah!

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.656
Yeah!

01:21:15.502 --> 01:21:18.336
I'll have my lawyer
send the paperwork.

01:21:18.338 --> 01:21:20.507
And I expect our horse to be
delivered by the weekend.

01:21:24.645 --> 01:21:26.411
Buddy, you did it.

01:21:26.413 --> 01:21:29.048
- You went back... He's like, "Yeah."
- Look, he's...

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.385
Yeah.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.722
Good race.

01:21:34.688 --> 01:21:37.322
Thanks. You, too.

01:21:37.324 --> 01:21:40.726
It's all thanks
to your lucky charm.

01:21:40.728 --> 01:21:44.065
He's not just a lucky charm.
He's Pistachio.

01:21:51.104 --> 01:21:54.238
I wanna say something
to you girls.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.878
You girls...
Tough as nails.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.714
Maybe tougher
than my grandsons.

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:05.116
A bet's a bet, you won
it fair and square.

01:22:05.118 --> 01:22:08.155
But if you ever wanna work on a
real ranch, you give me a call.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:13.959
I knew she was gonna like
being up here with you.

01:22:13.961 --> 01:22:15.260
- Guys.
- Thank you...

01:22:15.262 --> 01:22:16.896
You won!

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:19.165
- I can't believe it.
- I'm so proud of you.

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:20.402
Love you.

01:22:21.769 --> 01:22:23.102
I'm so proud of you, Lil!

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:25.037
Dad, thank you so much
for coming.

01:22:25.039 --> 01:22:26.571
- Are you kidding me?
- I can't believe that you made it.

01:22:26.573 --> 01:22:27.373
I wouldn't miss it
for anything in the world.

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:29.241
Hey. Heck of a race.

01:22:29.243 --> 01:22:30.244
Thanks.

01:22:33.346 --> 01:22:34.780
Lily!

01:22:34.782 --> 01:22:36.682
- Guys!
- Hey!

01:22:36.684 --> 01:22:38.550
Yeah. I got a little
surprise for you.

01:22:38.552 --> 01:22:40.619
I told Mary about
the race, she said,

01:22:40.621 --> 01:22:43.254
"Oh, the squad's gotta come down." And
I said, "Well, I'll drive you guys."

01:22:43.256 --> 01:22:45.892
And I thought maybe afterwards,
I could drive you all to camp.

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:47.226
I mean, if, you know,
you're okay with that.

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:49.027
- What? Really?
- Yeah!

01:22:49.029 --> 01:22:50.896
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, Lily!

01:22:50.898 --> 01:22:53.130
That was awesome.

01:22:53.132 --> 01:22:55.235
- Let's go.
- All right, I'll see you.

01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:59.370
Hey. I'm so
proud of you.

01:22:59.372 --> 01:23:02.777
I mean, you were just
amazing up there.

01:23:05.479 --> 01:23:07.648
You reminded me so much
of your mother.

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:11.584
- All right? You good?
- I'm good.

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.318
All happy today, right?

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.620
- All happy today.
- Nothing but happy today, okay?

01:23:15.622 --> 01:23:17.656
Congratulations!

01:23:17.658 --> 01:23:19.157
Thank you.

01:23:19.159 --> 01:23:20.992
I knew you three
would be the perfect team.

01:23:20.994 --> 01:23:22.827
Good to know that
I was right.

01:23:22.829 --> 01:23:25.598
Thanks, Max.
Uh... This is my dad.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.964
This is Max.

01:23:26.966 --> 01:23:29.000
He is one
of Aunt Glo's neighbors.

01:23:29.002 --> 01:23:32.169
- Yes.
- Nice to officially meet you, sir.

01:23:32.171 --> 01:23:33.638
Yes, right.

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:34.807
- We celebrated together.
- We did.

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.875
Really? That's nice.

01:23:36.877 --> 01:23:39.277
All right, I better go make sure
Ava goes and sees the doctor.

01:23:39.279 --> 01:23:41.213
You know how she can be.
Congratulations.

01:23:41.215 --> 01:23:42.217
All right.

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:46.554
Come on, Dad.
It's nothing.

01:23:48.021 --> 01:23:50.455
- He's just my friend.
- Right.

01:23:50.457 --> 01:23:53.125
He is! He's just a friend.
Don't tease me.

01:23:53.127 --> 01:23:55.727
Listen, I was talking
to your Aunt Glo,

01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:58.630
and she said that you can come
up here anytime you want.

01:23:58.632 --> 01:24:00.999
And you know what,
I thought, when I get busy

01:24:01.001 --> 01:24:03.835
- and my schedule gets crazy...
- Dad, just stop right there.

01:24:03.837 --> 01:24:05.737
- I wanna come up all the time.
- You do?

01:24:05.739 --> 01:24:07.473
Yes, all the time.

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:08.874
You wanna come back
all the time.

01:24:08.876 --> 01:24:10.241
I knew it. I knew it,
you see?

01:24:10.243 --> 01:24:12.343
What do you mean,
you knew it?

01:24:12.345 --> 01:24:14.546
You didn't know I was gonna like
it as much as I've liked it.

01:24:14.548 --> 01:24:16.014
Just 'cause you're getting older, it
doesn't mean I don't know things.

01:24:16.016 --> 01:24:16.581
I know things, all right?
Come on.

01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:17.551
I'm fine.

01:24:18.252 --> 01:24:19.420
Ohhh...

01:24:20.587 --> 01:24:23.054
Ava! Come here.

01:24:23.056 --> 01:24:24.356
- This is Ava.
- Hey!

01:24:24.358 --> 01:24:26.392
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:28.994
So, basically, Ava is
my partner in the race

01:24:28.996 --> 01:24:30.294
and she also
helped me train.

01:24:30.296 --> 01:24:32.231
She's a way better
rider than I am.

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:34.465
- That's so nice.
- It's not true.

01:24:34.467 --> 01:24:35.867
She's pro. If you wanna
see some good stuff...

01:24:35.869 --> 01:24:38.403
And then, Sam.
Sam. Come here.

01:24:38.405 --> 01:24:40.238
Um, this is
my cheer squad.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.839
- Sam is the person...
- Hey, girls.

01:24:41.841 --> 01:24:43.709
...who actually taught
me how to ride.

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:45.343
- Good job!
- That's awesome!

01:24:45.345 --> 01:24:46.947
But you girls prevailed.
