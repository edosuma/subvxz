WEBVTT

01:33.469 --> 01:35.054
Burn the Row!
Burn the Row!

01:35.054 --> 01:38.057
Burn the Row! Burn the Row!

01:46.607 --> 01:48.150
Looks like we kicked
the hornets' nest.

01:48.150 --> 01:51.111
That was the idea.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.364
Rile them up.

01:53.364 --> 01:54.740
Why draw them here?

01:54.740 --> 01:56.826
Let's go find out.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.216
How did I miss it?

02:12.216 --> 02:14.426
They've been playing us
for a fool all along.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.436
Vignette, we got to go.

02:29.984 --> 02:32.027
Philo. Philo, come back.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.737
Let's stick to the plan.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.364
The only chance of killing it
is back there.

02:35.364 --> 02:36.782
Don't you get it?
The Row is a diversion.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.284
They're out to slaughter Parliament.

02:38.284 --> 02:40.786
Fuck Parliament!
Fuck the New Dawn!

02:40.786 --> 02:42.621
It's Tourmaline I care about.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.416
- And we both know that Sparas
is after her.
- She knows.

02:45.416 --> 02:49.253
She agrees with me.
It has to be stopped.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.839
She cares too much about people.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.591
And you know that.

02:53.591 --> 02:56.135
And that's why you asked her to
lure it here in the first place.

02:56.135 --> 02:57.720
Didn't you?

02:57.720 --> 03:00.097
- Didn't you?!
- You're right.

03:00.097 --> 03:03.267
It's my fault she's in danger.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.894
I'm sorry.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.312
What do you want me to do?

03:13.944 --> 03:15.988
Tourmaline?

03:19.325 --> 03:21.118
Tourmaline.

03:23.162 --> 03:25.998
Philo was right. He had to go.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.708
Yeah, well, uh,

03:27.708 --> 03:30.461
the plan still works
without him.

03:30.461 --> 03:33.339
Last I heard...

03:34.548 --> 03:37.259
machine gun beats monster.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.346
- I want you to go.
- Right.

03:40.346 --> 03:44.099
Well, I'm not leaving you
to fight Sparas alone.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.519
You're not my protector.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.355
I'm sorry if you think
there's something between us,

03:49.355 --> 03:50.731
but there's not.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.442
Yeah, I know, I know.
You and Vignette.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.194
But I'm the one
who's still standing here.

03:55.194 --> 03:57.988
And if you get
hurt and turn Marrok,

03:57.988 --> 04:00.324
- what do I do then?
- You stop me.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.534
Like you did last time.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.954
I can't fight
two monsters at once.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.833
Is that how you see me?

04:09.833 --> 04:12.628
I'm safer without you.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.883
Did I not make myself clear?

04:17.883 --> 04:19.426
Go!

04:21.720 --> 04:23.222
Go!

04:47.538 --> 04:51.166
<i>Gentlemen,
it is an unwelcome surprise,</i>

04:51.166 --> 04:54.712
<i>but because Imogen Spurnrose
is a Burguish citizen,</i>

04:54.712 --> 04:58.215
<i>our entire government
is compelled to assemble.</i>

04:58.215 --> 04:59.717
<i>The session's</i>

04:59.717 --> 05:01.218
going to be a little late,
I'm afraid,

05:01.218 --> 05:03.929
because MPs are coming
from all over the city,

05:03.929 --> 05:05.806
and checkpoints
are causing chaos.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.726
- <i>Davorí.</i>
- I understand the need
for heightened security.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.644
Mr. Millworthy, should
the Pact be concerned

05:10.644 --> 05:12.563
that your entire government
is assembling

05:12.563 --> 05:13.897
to hear out our enemy?

05:13.897 --> 05:16.567
I assure you, Ambassador,
it's a legal protocol,

05:16.567 --> 05:18.318
nothing else.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.988
Cunning of them to
use your own laws against you.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.781
- Quite.
<i>- Mrázls.</i>

05:22.781 --> 05:24.908
And as soon as the New Dawn
has finished,

05:24.908 --> 05:27.453
you, of course,
will have the floor.

05:27.453 --> 05:29.038
This way, please.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.332
Forgive me,
Mr. Millworthy,

05:32.332 --> 05:34.668
does this mean that
we have to wait outside

05:34.668 --> 05:35.919
while the New Dawn speaks?

05:35.919 --> 05:37.546
I wouldn't add insult
to injury

05:37.546 --> 05:39.173
and make you
sit through that, no.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.716
Ambassador, if I may, uh,

05:40.716 --> 05:43.093
whatever lies the New Dawn
rebels plan to feed

05:43.093 --> 05:47.014
to our allies, we should
surely be at hand to hear them.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.974
How else will we counter them
with the truth?

05:48.974 --> 05:51.560
Major Vir is right.
As distasteful as it will be,

05:51.560 --> 05:53.479
we must insist on being present.

05:53.479 --> 05:55.939
I see. Well, um...

05:55.939 --> 05:58.442
I'll alert the members
to your request.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.819
A-And I'll lobby on your behalf.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.825
Meanwhile, please
make yourselves

06:06.825 --> 06:08.911
as comfortable as possible.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.920
As comfortable
as the circumstances permit.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.178
His Excellency,
the Pact ambassador.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.932
Prating, bourgeois fool.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.142
King's cousin, of course.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.187
I wonder how all that
finery will look

06:35.187 --> 06:38.065
rotting in a field.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.529
Don't expect sympathy.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.614
You won't fool me
a second time.

06:45.614 --> 06:48.200
You took his horn?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.621
All your fine words about
fighting for the oppressed,

06:52.621 --> 06:55.624
and you took a faun's horn?

06:57.167 --> 06:59.002
Your speech.

07:07.219 --> 07:10.305
How do I know you won't
hurt Agreus?

07:11.348 --> 07:12.933
You don't.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.166
Look at what
they done to him.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.378
He stood against us.

07:47.426 --> 07:48.886
<i>Thanks to the brave actions</i>

07:48.886 --> 07:50.888
<i>of our comrades last night,</i>

07:50.888 --> 07:52.598
the mob will come.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.516
Uh, a little suggestion,
if I may.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.561
Serve 'em up to the Sparas!

07:59.605 --> 08:02.316
Unfortunately,

08:02.316 --> 08:04.526
- his fight is elsewhere.
- What?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.197
The Sparas isn't coming
to the Row?

08:08.197 --> 08:11.408
- Correct. He is not.
- Shit.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.411
You might have mentioned
we'd be fighting without him.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.997
We have
all we need, Comrade.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.124
Weapons in our hands,

08:19.124 --> 08:21.418
courage in our hearts,

08:21.418 --> 08:24.838
and the attention
of the Burgue.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.341
So, what happens now?

08:29.760 --> 08:32.679
That rabble will soon
overrun the police

08:32.679 --> 08:35.140
and storm through into the Row.

08:37.434 --> 08:41.188
But how do we stop
them? There's so many.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.316
We don't want to stop them.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.485
We will let them come.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.655
Offer no resistance

08:49.655 --> 08:52.991
until they reach here,

08:52.991 --> 08:55.994
where we will open fire
and kill them all.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.666
If they get that far
they'll tear the Row apart.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.835
If we want
to defeat our enemies,

09:03.835 --> 09:05.796
we must be willing

09:05.796 --> 09:08.340
to make the greater sacrifice.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.343
Listen,
it'll work better

09:11.343 --> 09:13.220
in Oberon Square.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.265
Your plan, just like you said.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.600
There are more places to hide,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.560
more cover to shoot from.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.647
We can pick them off
from all sides.

09:23.647 --> 09:27.776
Only if the mob
move in that direction.

09:27.776 --> 09:30.654
Those men outside,
they're not looking for you.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.949
They're looking for the ones
who firebombed their friends.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.577
Go on, <i>ziska.</i>

09:38.787 --> 09:41.707
They will come there,
just like you said.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.709
But then I show myself,

09:43.709 --> 09:47.129
let them chase me
right into your trap.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.799
With this plan,
our entire victory

09:50.799 --> 09:52.718
depends on you.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.344
If you should fail

09:54.344 --> 09:57.180
or if they catch you...

09:57.180 --> 09:59.224
They'll be looking
for me, too.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.522
I'll go with her.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.110
We'll draw the bastards
right to you.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.843
Where you going, Critch?

10:48.357 --> 10:50.192
- No!
- Hold up.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.027
Wait!

10:54.321 --> 10:56.323
Say hello to Berwick
when you see him.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.159
- Bring him up, lads.
- Come on, now.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.244
Come on, string him up.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.748
Get him up! Come on!

11:04.748 --> 11:07.459
The time has come, Inspector.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.758
The time has finally come.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.083
I'll do it, for Agreus' sake.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.043
I'll read your speech out
word for word.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.545
But I have to ask,
who wrote this?

11:51.545 --> 11:53.922
Our finest diplomatic minds

11:53.922 --> 11:55.715
toiled day and night.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.551
Clearly, they have no idea
about how to address

11:57.551 --> 11:58.802
the Burguish Parliament.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.220
It requires a formality.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.888
If I read this out,
we're likely to be thrown out

12:01.888 --> 12:04.349
before there's any hope
of achieving the peace treaty.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.767
You know best.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.644
Put it in your own words
if you wish.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.521
In my own wor...

12:12.274 --> 12:14.693
This is a matter
of life and death.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.710
<i>You could refuse</i>

12:31.710 --> 12:33.587
the ambassador's request,
of course.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.589
The New Dawn wouldn't mind.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.341
Didn't the Foreign Office say
that would be improper?

12:38.341 --> 12:40.469
Hang diplomatic protocol.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.512
If it speeds up this
rotten business,

12:42.512 --> 12:44.139
I say let the Pact
and the New Dawn

12:44.139 --> 12:46.183
sit and stare each other
to death.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.028
It's time.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.449
Parliament awaits your address.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.418
Quick, get some water.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.963
I, uh, are you all right?

13:18.048 --> 13:20.091
Come on. Come on, quickly.
Water!

13:21.218 --> 13:24.638
- Miss... Miss Spurnrose...
- You have
no reason to believe me, but

13:24.638 --> 13:26.890
- something terrible
is about to happen.
- What do you mean?

13:26.890 --> 13:30.060
Kastor's been exchanging very
odd looks with that Pact envoy.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.646
I think they're working
together. I think he's New Dawn.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.483
I can't believe
that Major Vir...

13:36.483 --> 13:38.235
Oh...

13:38.235 --> 13:40.153
Oh.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.113
Oh, dreadfully embarrassing.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.409
I apologize for Comrade Imogen.

13:46.409 --> 13:49.120
She seems to fall ill
at the most inconvenient moment.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.081
That's all right. I think
we should give the young lady

13:51.081 --> 13:53.250
a moment to, uh,
catch her breath.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.459
That won't
be necessary.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.169
We are ready to proceed.

13:59.005 --> 14:06.137
Kill the Critch!
Kill the Critch!

14:06.137 --> 14:08.807
Kill the Critch!

14:24.906 --> 14:26.741
It's time.

14:36.835 --> 14:39.170
Major Vir, I have spent
my whole life in the theater,

14:39.170 --> 14:40.797
but you're a great performer.

14:40.797 --> 14:44.301
I can tell you
I was completely fooled.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.513
What exactly are you implying,
Mr. Millworthy?

14:48.513 --> 14:50.890
"A threat to the natural order.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.351
An offensive
peasant's daydream."

14:53.351 --> 14:55.228
Isn't that what you called them?

14:56.771 --> 15:00.400
Ah, yes. Yes, the, uh...
the New Dawn.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.450
How long have you been
working for them?

15:22.464 --> 15:25.050
The Pact is finished,
Mr. Millworthy.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.052
Everyone knows it.

15:27.052 --> 15:30.972
But my government would rather
fight to the last man

15:30.972 --> 15:32.766
than sue for peace.

15:32.766 --> 15:36.686
Well, if the war is lost,
what are you doing here today?

15:36.686 --> 15:39.939
Because I am a patriot, sir.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.566
Because...

15:41.566 --> 15:45.654
Because I don't want
to see my country in ruins.

15:47.656 --> 15:50.075
I plan to speak in support
of the peace treaty.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.411
Your ambassador
will call it treason,

15:53.411 --> 15:55.163
and you will be executed.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.915
Yes, but then I will die
with my principles intact.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.417
Surely you can understand, no?

16:00.418 --> 16:03.546
You're a defender of the fae,
Mr. Millworthy.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.674
Always have been.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.468
- Well, that...
- You are... you are

16:08.468 --> 16:11.262
a rare breed, Mr. Millworthy.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.015
A decent human being.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.351
If there were only time,
in a different world,

16:16.351 --> 16:18.019
then we might truly
have been friends.

16:18.019 --> 16:22.524
But yes,
I am working with the New Dawn.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.402
And yes, I am prepared
to risk everything for peace.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.862
So, will you stand with me

16:27.862 --> 16:30.782
or against me?

17:06.818 --> 17:08.820
Oh!

17:12.323 --> 17:13.700
Aah!

17:28.298 --> 17:29.758
Kill
the Critch!

17:29.758 --> 17:31.801
Kill the Critch!

17:31.801 --> 17:33.344
Kill
the Critch!

17:33.344 --> 17:35.138
Kill the Critch!

17:35.138 --> 17:36.598
Kill
the Critch!

18:11.132 --> 18:12.425
Sergeant.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.844
Constable.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.644
This takes it
too fucking far, Thatch.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.439
You do this,

18:26.439 --> 18:28.358
there will be a reckoning.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.823
This is the reckoning, Sergeant.

18:36.407 --> 18:40.078
Don't forget who you are
and what they are.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.877
Oi, what you want us
to do?

18:50.255 --> 18:51.714
Sarge?

19:02.225 --> 19:03.643
Open the gate!

19:33.548 --> 19:35.174
Come on!

19:35.174 --> 19:36.926
Go!

19:36.926 --> 19:38.469
Come on!

19:38.469 --> 19:40.346
Fucking have 'em!

19:55.361 --> 19:58.573
Fucking move.
Out of the fucking way!

19:58.573 --> 20:00.825
Hey! Come here.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.702
Fuck off.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.871
Come on!

20:06.581 --> 20:08.583
You fucking Critch scum.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.543
You're gonna get
all you fucking deserve!

20:10.543 --> 20:12.879
Chop her fucking head off!

20:12.879 --> 20:16.341
Oi!

20:16.341 --> 20:18.426
Oh, shit.

20:20.303 --> 20:23.139
Hey! Cut her fucking wings off!

20:23.139 --> 20:25.224
Hey! Hey,
get the fuck out of the way.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.353
Who else?
Get her fucking wings off!

20:30.063 --> 20:32.106
Oh, shit! Oh!

20:32.106 --> 20:34.400
- Oi! Stop!
- Out of the way!

20:34.400 --> 20:36.069
Official business!

20:36.069 --> 20:38.655
Come on! Halt!

20:44.077 --> 20:46.079
Official business!

20:47.246 --> 20:49.457
Are you mad?

20:50.541 --> 20:52.919
You're pointing those things
in the wrong direction.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.547
The Sparas is inside.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.634
At ease.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.096
- Sound the alarm!
- No!

21:04.681 --> 21:06.683
That's the worst thing
you can do.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.269
Where's Runyon Millworthy?

21:20.697 --> 21:22.699
Okay, smash his horns!

21:25.702 --> 21:27.620
Hold his head still, lads!

21:27.620 --> 21:29.163
- Kill him!
- Get him!

21:51.310 --> 21:52.812
Come on!

21:52.812 --> 21:54.897
Go!

21:56.315 --> 21:57.859
Come on!

22:03.072 --> 22:04.782
Find
the fucking vermin.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.952
Find 'em!

22:07.952 --> 22:09.620
Got to be here
somewhere!

22:10.621 --> 22:11.956
Wait.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.292
Let more of them come.

22:14.292 --> 22:16.586
Give me that fucking torch.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.629
Yeah, smoke 'em out.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.591
Gotta be here somewhere.

22:22.925 --> 22:25.428
Burn it down!

22:25.428 --> 22:28.514
- Burn it down!
- Burn it down!
All of it!

22:53.164 --> 22:54.665
Ladies,

22:54.665 --> 22:56.751
gentlemen, let's proceed.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.554
- Philo,
what are you doing here?
- I need you

23:08.554 --> 23:10.181
to keep your eyes on me
while I'm talking, all right?

23:10.181 --> 23:11.307
All right.

23:11.307 --> 23:12.600
- Major Vir is...
- I know.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.018
Major Vir, he told me.

23:14.018 --> 23:15.895
- He's New Dawn.
- The Sparas.

23:19.690 --> 23:22.485
What did you just say?

23:24.070 --> 23:27.615
Vir is the Sparas.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.661
Eyes.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.998
What do we...
What-what do we do?

23:35.998 --> 23:37.583
The guards
will evacuate Parliament.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.670
We just need to buy them time.

23:58.771 --> 24:02.733
What the devil
is the delay now?

24:02.733 --> 24:05.319
Major.

24:05.319 --> 24:07.613
What's taking the time?

24:57.747 --> 25:00.041
- What's going on?
- The Sparas is coming!

25:00.041 --> 25:03.002
The doors! Bar the doors!

25:15.723 --> 25:18.184
For Martyr's sake, help us!

25:18.184 --> 25:20.353
You heard him.
Hold the door!

25:20.353 --> 25:22.104
Hold the door!

25:27.401 --> 25:29.111
Hold it!

26:44.812 --> 26:46.230
That's a sight.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.606
That's not supposed to be here.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.735
Thank the gods it is.

26:50.735 --> 26:52.194
I have to go.

26:52.194 --> 26:53.946
- Vini!
- Get off me.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.407
No, you'll lead them away.

26:56.407 --> 26:58.034
Stick to the plan.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.827
Don't abandon us again, Vini.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.329
Let go of me, Kaine. Please.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.999
Vini, please don't do this.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.837
What's Vignette doing?

27:09.837 --> 27:11.380
- Stop!
- There they are!

27:11.380 --> 27:14.050
Vini!

27:14.050 --> 27:16.344
You fucking Critch.

27:16.344 --> 27:18.095
No!

27:18.095 --> 27:20.556
No, no.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.435
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. No.

27:24.435 --> 27:25.686
No.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.326
Someone shoot it!

27:40.326 --> 27:41.452
They've got snipers!

27:41.452 --> 27:42.703
You hear that?

27:48.459 --> 27:49.377
Fuck!

27:56.384 --> 27:57.927
Back to the...

27:58.928 --> 28:02.473
Fuck!

28:10.064 --> 28:11.399
Fuck.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.205
Darius?

29:15.588 --> 29:17.256
Darius?

29:22.803 --> 29:28.100
<i>Morr faélar isteag mit.</i>

30:11.060 --> 30:12.019
Vini!

31:52.369 --> 31:53.787
Darius.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.778
You did it.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.283
We did it.

32:42.670 --> 32:46.298
For we are soldiers
of the Burgue.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.261
Of...

32:51.261 --> 32:52.888
the...

33:17.788 --> 33:20.457
Sergeant,
we must put an end to this.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.752
Sarge,
what should we do?

33:44.231 --> 33:45.649
What have I done?

33:53.657 --> 33:55.159
You went with your heart.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.875
I've always loved her.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.503
I know.

34:12.843 --> 34:14.845
And I'll always love you.

34:20.434 --> 34:22.436
It will never be over, will it?

34:27.608 --> 34:29.318
Not for me.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.870
Please don't die
trying to stop them.

34:41.872 --> 34:43.457
Please.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.388
Hold your fire!

34:58.388 --> 34:59.848
He's got the Sparas.

34:59.848 --> 35:03.018
What's that?

35:27.543 --> 35:30.045
Parliament's safe!

35:32.631 --> 35:34.633
It's over!

35:36.260 --> 35:37.678
No.

35:38.679 --> 35:40.681
We fight another day.

35:46.353 --> 35:49.565
Hide for now, Comrades.

35:49.565 --> 35:51.650
We lost the battle,
but not the war.

36:45.162 --> 36:46.955
Comrade.

36:59.927 --> 37:02.179
You lost.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.563
But the seeds

37:11.563 --> 37:14.316
have been sown.

37:15.692 --> 37:18.111
Clear out
of the housing!

37:22.616 --> 37:24.743
She's here!

37:24.743 --> 37:27.829
I have the leader
of the New Dawn.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.462
Rovnost.

37:58.986 --> 38:01.488
All right,
clean this mess up!

38:01.488 --> 38:03.782
Daniel, put out that fire!

38:05.617 --> 38:07.619
Drag that man
out of here!

38:10.247 --> 38:12.124
Oi, you lot,
get up here!

39:32.037 --> 39:35.624
So,
is death the end?

39:37.042 --> 39:40.921
Death's the greatest leveler
of us all.

39:40.921 --> 39:42.923
Sole certainty

39:42.923 --> 39:45.842
in this uncertain life.

39:45.842 --> 39:48.220
So, what defines us?

39:48.220 --> 39:50.180
Is it our skin,

39:50.180 --> 39:52.265
soil, status

39:52.265 --> 39:54.309
or our strife?

39:54.309 --> 39:58.396
Our lives are shaped
by the hand of power.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.273
Our fate

40:00.273 --> 40:03.693
and future are balanced
on his knife.

40:03.693 --> 40:07.989
His blade cuts
both sweet and sour.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.867
Seems we've no choice
of skin, soil

40:10.867 --> 40:13.078
or strife.

40:13.078 --> 40:16.498
But do we not we all tread

40:16.498 --> 40:20.168
the same sweet, dark earth?

40:20.168 --> 40:25.298
Sleep neath the same
starred blanket of night?

40:25.298 --> 40:28.218
Do not we all love,
laugh, grieve

40:28.218 --> 40:30.428
and have worth?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.472
Well, the truth is

40:32.472 --> 40:35.976
our path is ours to define.

40:38.311 --> 40:41.398
Because our own flesh and blood

40:41.398 --> 40:44.484
will make their own line.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.370
What?
What do you think you're doing?

40:55.370 --> 40:57.789
That's undermined
two hours of work.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.625
That's it.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.039
Why am I standing here?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.460
I was told
you would never accept

41:43.460 --> 41:45.545
a half-fae chancellor.

41:46.963 --> 41:50.884
That the so-called birthright of...

41:50.884 --> 41:54.012
Absalom Breakspear's
eldest son...

41:55.055 --> 41:57.390
...didn't apply to me.

41:57.390 --> 41:58.892
Mm.

42:02.896 --> 42:05.899
So, thank you for the honor.

42:07.567 --> 42:09.903
But we should be honest.

42:09.903 --> 42:12.614
You see a human man,

42:12.614 --> 42:14.449
raised,

42:14.449 --> 42:17.285
conditioned

42:17.285 --> 42:19.871
by institutions

42:19.871 --> 42:22.082
that enforce your values:

42:22.082 --> 42:24.125
Burguish schools,

42:24.125 --> 42:25.543
the army,

42:25.543 --> 42:27.045
police.

42:29.631 --> 42:31.633
What you don't see...

42:35.053 --> 42:37.472
...are the scars on my back...

42:39.474 --> 42:41.476
...where my wings...

42:42.644 --> 42:44.646
...were mutilated and stolen.

42:47.691 --> 42:51.111
So it's easy for you to ignore
that part of me you hate.

42:52.696 --> 42:55.615
The part of me your institutions

42:55.615 --> 42:58.326
taught me to hate.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.334
I never felt right
hiding what I was...

43:07.919 --> 43:09.587
...just so that I could enjoy

43:09.587 --> 43:12.424
the privileges

43:12.424 --> 43:14.634
of being a human man

43:14.634 --> 43:18.638
while others like me were
being persecuted.

43:18.638 --> 43:21.725
Persecuted even by me.

43:24.561 --> 43:28.356
I suppose that makes me
your ideal candidate, hmm?

43:28.356 --> 43:30.942
A self-loathing fae

43:30.942 --> 43:33.945
who won't really
change anything.

43:33.945 --> 43:36.031
And that's the point, isn't it?

43:37.032 --> 43:38.616
Yeah.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.244
You have no intention
of changing.

43:41.244 --> 43:43.079
You have far too much invested

43:43.079 --> 43:47.208
in keeping things
exactly the way they are.

43:48.251 --> 43:51.004
But you underestimate
all faefolk.

43:52.005 --> 43:54.341
We...

43:54.341 --> 43:57.260
are a people
who know how to change.

43:58.887 --> 44:00.513
If I'd understood that
about myself,

44:00.513 --> 44:03.350
if I'd been able
to change sooner,

44:03.350 --> 44:07.354
maybe I wouldn't have had
to lose the love of my life.

44:07.354 --> 44:09.022
Hmm.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.442
She deserves better than me.

44:14.027 --> 44:16.029
So do all faefolk.

44:17.447 --> 44:20.367
They have as much right
to sit here

44:20.367 --> 44:22.452
as any of you.

44:28.041 --> 44:31.086
The next chancellor
should have horns.

44:31.086 --> 44:33.088
What?

44:33.088 --> 44:34.964
- Or wings.
- Are you kidding me?

44:34.964 --> 44:37.133
But it won't be me.

44:37.133 --> 44:41.388
I won't be your excuse
not to change.

45:45.660 --> 45:48.246
It shows every flaw.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.250
It's magnificent.

49:26.881 --> 49:28.633
You choose one.

49:28.633 --> 49:30.176
Here we go.

49:30.176 --> 49:31.803
Choose one, mate.

49:31.803 --> 49:34.222
Now, you put your money down, right.

49:34.222 --> 49:36.307
- There, you.
- Get the beer down.

49:40.561 --> 49:42.563
Where you going?

49:48.695 --> 49:50.196
Inspector now, is it?

49:50.196 --> 49:52.573
A credit to the force,
they said.

49:52.573 --> 49:54.450
Have they met you?

49:54.450 --> 49:56.577
Piss off.

49:56.577 --> 49:59.872
Anyway, I'll aim to be.

49:59.872 --> 50:02.375
Better late than never,
I suppose.

50:05.378 --> 50:08.881
You know, you might've mentioned

50:08.881 --> 50:11.926
that you were Breakspear's son.

50:12.927 --> 50:15.471
Would it have made you
any less of a prick?

50:15.471 --> 50:17.223
Of course.

50:19.225 --> 50:21.060
To your face.

50:37.702 --> 50:39.620
Yes. Look,

50:39.620 --> 50:40.788
I know.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.582
But it was a good show.

50:42.582 --> 50:44.667
It was. Philo!

50:48.588 --> 50:53.176
Did you ever dream
of seeing this?

50:53.176 --> 50:55.678
Peace on the Row.

50:56.679 --> 50:58.556
Peace.

50:58.556 --> 51:00.516
But for how long, I wonder.

51:00.516 --> 51:02.226
Well, things are changing.

51:02.226 --> 51:04.020
But you're right.
A little bit slowly.

51:04.020 --> 51:06.355
I mean,
how long will it be really

51:06.355 --> 51:09.859
before any faefolk
are elected to Parliament?

51:11.027 --> 51:13.654
You know, I did dream

51:13.654 --> 51:15.782
that it would be you
leading the charge.

51:15.782 --> 51:19.786
I think you would've made
a very good chancellor.

51:19.786 --> 51:21.871
No.

51:21.871 --> 51:23.664
It would've made
an interesting tale

51:23.664 --> 51:25.333
for your theater.

51:26.751 --> 51:29.670
And it's time we wrote
different stories around here.

51:29.670 --> 51:31.297
Yeah. No, no,
that's entirely right.

51:31.297 --> 51:32.882
It's the kind of thing
your mother would say.

51:32.882 --> 51:35.009
I can hear her voice.

51:36.010 --> 51:38.596
She'd be proud of you.

51:41.599 --> 51:43.309
You loved her, didn't you?

51:46.354 --> 51:47.772
I did.

51:49.774 --> 51:51.776
And she loved you back?

52:01.369 --> 52:02.787
Hmm.

52:04.372 --> 52:06.791
She'd have been proud
of you, too.

52:11.838 --> 52:15.716
Well, so much for your
glittering career in politics.

52:15.716 --> 52:18.386
What are you gonna do,
go back to the police?

52:19.804 --> 52:22.515
Or will the next chapter
be further afield,

52:22.515 --> 52:24.600
away from home?

52:26.185 --> 52:28.187
What happens next?

52:39.907 --> 52:42.535
I suppose
we'll have to find out.
