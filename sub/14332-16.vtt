17:24.108 --> 17:25.344
ARE YOU?

17:25.411 --> 17:26.912
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.313
HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN

17:28.380 --> 17:29.848
IN A PROM DRESS BEFORE?

17:29.915 --> 17:32.584
- "YOU'VE BEEN A FAILURE
SINCE THE DAY YOU WERE BORN."

17:32.651 --> 17:34.253
- THANKS.
IT REALLY TAKES THE EDGE OFF.

17:34.319 --> 17:37.022
- ALL THE WOMEN FROM OUR PLANET
HAVE DISAPPEARED.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.658
WE'VE BEEN WANDERING
AROUND OUR GALAXY LOST

17:39.725 --> 17:41.460
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AROUND
TO MAKE US STOP

17:41.527 --> 17:42.761
AND ASK FOR DIRECTIONS.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.630
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I LIVE.

17:44.696 --> 17:46.832
- I HEAR YOU, BROTHER.
FIST BUMP!

17:46.899 --> 17:50.035
WHAT DO I HAVE,
A HAND FUNGUS?

17:50.102 --> 17:51.537
OH, IT TURNS OUT
I DO.

17:51.603 --> 17:55.307
- WE ARE THE SNOB-ULACS
FROM THE PLANET SNOB-ULAN.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.409
- OUR SENSORS INDICATE
THAT YOU FOUR

17:57.476 --> 17:59.044
ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DISAPPEARANCE

17:59.111 --> 18:01.280
OF ALL THE FEMALES
IN THE UNIVERSE.

18:01.346 --> 18:04.116
- AND THANKS TO YOU,
WE ARE STARVING.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.784
WE TRIED TO MAKE
OUR OWN DINNER.

18:05.851 --> 18:08.287
BUT WHEN WE CALLED OUT,
"HONEY, I'M READY TO FEAST

18:08.353 --> 18:11.089
ON GLORNOCKS,"
NOTHING HAPPENED.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.592
- OUR MAGIC WORDS
DID NOT WORK.

18:13.659 --> 18:15.928
- WE ARE GOING
TO ANNIHILATE THE EARTH

18:15.994 --> 18:19.865
UNLESS YOU THROW US
A FORMAL DINNER PARTY.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.570
- DAD!
DO SOMETHING!

18:24.636 --> 18:26.505
- WOULD YOU GUYS SETTLE
FOR A RUBBER CHICKEN

18:26.572 --> 18:27.673
FROM MY CLOWN SUIT?

18:27.739 --> 18:30.375
- NO!
PREPARE TO BE DESTROYED.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.810
- HOLD IT, HOLD IT.

18:31.877 --> 18:34.379
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STALL
THESE GUYS FOR 23 HOURS

18:34.446 --> 18:37.282
UNTIL THE WOMEN COME BACK
AND PREPARE A MEAL.

18:37.349 --> 18:40.385
SNOB-ULACS, ON OUR PLANET,
IT IS CUSTOMARY

18:40.452 --> 18:43.288
TO HAVE 23 HOURS
OF ENTERTAINMENT BEFORE A MEAL.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.656
- BUT--BUT--

18:44.723 --> 18:46.391
- YOU DON'T WANNA BE RUDE,
DO YOU?

18:46.458 --> 18:49.061
AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE THE SNOB-ULACS.

18:49.127 --> 18:52.231
- WELL PLAYED, EARTH KETCHUP.
COMMENCE WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.899
{\an8}- I'LL START BY REGALING YOU

18:53.966 --> 18:56.802
{\an8}WITH STORIES
FROM MY COLORFUL PAST.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.838
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHEN
MY DRY CLEANER SAID,

18:59.905 --> 19:02.708
{\an8}"NO MORE CHILI BEFORE JOGGING."

19:03.842 --> 19:05.444
HER NAME WAS MITZY MALLONE,

19:05.511 --> 19:08.547
AND SHE COULD'VE BEEN MY WIFE
IF SHE WASN'T A HORSE.

19:10.349 --> 19:11.283
[all snoring]

19:11.350 --> 19:12.784
- WE'RE OFF THE HOOK.

19:12.851 --> 19:15.687
CROCKER'S SUPER BORING STORIES
PUT THE ALIENS TO SLEEP.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.155
- THEY MADE ME TENSE!

19:17.222 --> 19:18.557
[all gasp]

19:18.624 --> 19:20.859
- ENOUGH WITH THE STALLING.
WHEN'S DINNER?

19:20.926 --> 19:23.028
- UH, SOON.
OKAY, DAD, YOUR TURN.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.463
STALL FOR AS LONG
AS YOU CAN.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.765
- EH, UH--
ALL RIGHT, ALIENS.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.901
PREPARE TO BE WOWED
BY THE MUSICAL STYLINGS

19:28.967 --> 19:31.770
OF DAD AND HIS BONGOS.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.305

WE CAN ALL ENJOY--CHARADES?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.582

I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT.

THERE IS NO DINNER.

19:55.794 --> 19:58.030
AND NOW,
THERE WILL BE DESTRUCTION.
