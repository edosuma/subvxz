WEBVTT

00:01.142 --> 00:02.363
<i>Previously on "Bel-Air"...</i>

00:02.463 --> 00:03.645
- Everything okay, Geoffrey?
- Why do you ask?

00:03.745 --> 00:04.866
Just making sure
you're happy here, that's all.

00:04.866 --> 00:06.007
I'm just here
to do my job, Phil.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.169
<i>Something's not right.</i>

00:07.269 --> 00:08.530
This is a surprise.

00:08.630 --> 00:09.932
This is Will's decision
to make.

00:10.032 --> 00:11.534
Will deserves
a shot at his dreams.

00:11.634 --> 00:13.016
He'll play for your team
and help you win,

00:13.116 --> 00:14.337
but you don't get to own him.

00:14.437 --> 00:16.460
Didn't we agree that H2Ivy
would be

00:16.560 --> 00:17.701
the official drink
of the house?

00:17.801 --> 00:20.104
If I can just close
the Simply Spiked deal,

00:20.204 --> 00:21.105
it would be a game changer.

00:21.205 --> 00:22.867
Then H2Ivy is over with.

00:22.967 --> 00:24.910
The venue we selected
cannot accommodate that,

00:25.010 --> 00:27.433
and, yes, it's too late
to find another one.

00:27.533 --> 00:30.837
With this art show coming,
there's a million people

00:30.937 --> 00:32.399
with a million opinions.

00:32.499 --> 00:33.881
- Coming through?
- I was hoping to.

00:33.981 --> 00:35.162
You okay with that?

00:35.262 --> 00:36.283
I mean, I know
we're not together,

00:36.383 --> 00:37.885
but we're still cool, right?
- Of course.

00:37.985 --> 00:39.968
Do you ever feel
like we're too different?

00:40.068 --> 00:41.530
As long as we down
for each other,

00:41.630 --> 00:42.731
<i>doesn't matter what
anybody else thinks.</i>

00:42.831 --> 00:44.373
You know y'all wanted me
to marry LaMarcus,

00:44.473 --> 00:45.935
and now you have nothing to say
about Jazz?

00:46.035 --> 00:47.056
Faculty nominations

00:47.156 --> 00:48.218
for the Founder's Award
are coming out.

00:48.318 --> 00:49.539
Your actions the day
of the protest

00:49.639 --> 00:50.821
didn't go unnoticed.

00:50.921 --> 00:52.222
Bassin got to you,
and now your name's

00:52.322 --> 00:53.624
on the Founder's Award list.

00:53.724 --> 00:55.146
It's actually a lot more
complicated than that.

00:55.246 --> 00:57.268
I thought we were working
on the same agenda,

00:57.368 --> 00:59.491
but I guess you have
one of your own.

01:01.854 --> 01:05.038
<i>You see, it's two type
of people in life.</i>

01:05.138 --> 01:09.002
<i>It's people that wake up
and wish they had it.</i>

01:09.102 --> 01:11.245
<i>There's people that
wake up and go get it.</i>

01:11.345 --> 01:12.967
<i>We go get it, baby.</i>

01:13.067 --> 01:14.208
<i>Fine, let's go.</i>

01:14.308 --> 01:15.690
<i>♪ All my life,

01:15.790 --> 01:17.052

01:31.809 --> 01:32.951

01:33.051 --> 01:34.793
Do you know how many miles
an NBA player runs

01:34.893 --> 01:35.754
in the season?

01:35.854 --> 01:36.755
Over 100.

01:36.855 --> 01:39.559

01:39.659 --> 01:41.521

Well, well, well.

01:54.196 --> 01:56.218
Bel-Air got you looking soft
out here, bro.

01:56.318 --> 01:57.340
You tripping.
I'm from Philly.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.701
What's up?

01:58.801 --> 02:00.263
Man, that rich boy shit
don't mean nothing out here.

02:00.363 --> 02:01.705
Won't keep you
on the team either.

02:01.805 --> 02:03.467
Hey, look at him.
He about to get cut.

02:03.567 --> 02:04.829
- Snip, snip.
- So what y'all trying to do?

02:04.929 --> 02:05.990
Need to have
that same energy

02:06.090 --> 02:07.352
when you pick up
these weights, boy.

02:07.452 --> 02:08.473
- Real talk.
- Let's get this work, man.

02:08.573 --> 02:09.594
He ain't gonna make it.

02:09.694 --> 02:10.996
Later, Bel-Air.

02:11.096 --> 02:13.159

02:20.347 --> 02:22.049
Ah, thank you, Geoffrey.

02:22.149 --> 02:23.531
No problem.

02:23.631 --> 02:24.732
Almost ready for Janice.

02:24.832 --> 02:26.614
Mm-hmm.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.017
I didn't realize how hands-on
she was gonna be.

02:29.117 --> 02:32.461
Fellowship not as rewarding
as you had hoped, huh?

02:32.561 --> 02:34.784
Janice has made it very clear

02:34.884 --> 02:37.507
that she is not comfortable
with me pushing the envelope.

02:37.607 --> 02:39.189
Hmm.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.671
Real talk?

02:40.771 --> 02:42.033
She's lucky to have you, Viv,

02:42.133 --> 02:43.595
and they need you more
than you need them.

02:43.695 --> 02:46.518
Trust me.
- Can you tell her that for me?

02:46.618 --> 02:48.120
Oh, come on.

02:48.220 --> 02:49.722
She loves you.

02:49.822 --> 02:51.724
I think she has
a little crush on you.

02:51.824 --> 02:53.767
Whatever I can do, Viv.
I've got you.

02:53.867 --> 02:54.888
Well, you know we are hosting

02:54.988 --> 02:56.890
Phil's family reunion
this year.

02:56.990 --> 02:59.213
Oh, I'm gonna really need
your help then.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.615
Yep.

03:00.715 --> 03:02.898
The whole of the Banks crew.

03:02.998 --> 03:04.660
I'll stock up on the alcohol--

03:04.760 --> 03:05.661
for you, of course,
not for them.

03:07.723 --> 03:10.086
Oh, Geoffrey,
I have missed you.

03:13.370 --> 03:15.653
So how's everything been going?

03:19.377 --> 03:21.760
With me and Phil?

03:21.860 --> 03:25.605
In general, but, yeah,
with you two.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.088
- We're finding our way.
- Good.

03:28.188 --> 03:30.811
Because, with all this stuff
happening at the firm,

03:30.911 --> 03:33.414
you're the one
he trusts the most.

03:33.514 --> 03:37.699
He needs you right now.

03:37.799 --> 03:41.103
Ain't never been called soft.

03:41.203 --> 03:42.625
Don't fucking know me.

03:42.725 --> 03:43.826
Well, you don't
know them either.

03:43.926 --> 03:45.428
What are you talking about?

03:45.528 --> 03:47.831
Hudson took three buses
to get here

03:47.931 --> 03:51.075
and worked out before school
every day for a year.

03:51.175 --> 03:52.797
Now he's a starter.

03:52.897 --> 03:56.121
Brian--he was sleeping
in his car when Doc found him.

03:56.221 --> 03:59.024
Now he's got college coaches
beating down the door.

04:01.868 --> 04:05.031
Their hunger?
That's their edge.

04:07.234 --> 04:09.977
Look, I didn't come here
to ride the bench, Jackie.

04:10.077 --> 04:11.419
Okay.

04:11.519 --> 04:15.304
So show 'em you not just
some bougie kid from Bel-Air.

04:15.404 --> 04:18.828
What's your edge?

04:18.928 --> 04:21.050
First day's always rough.

04:22.612 --> 04:24.715
I give this book
to all my players.

04:24.815 --> 04:27.478
10,000 hours of practice
to be great.

04:27.578 --> 04:28.680
Just gotta keep
putting in the time.

04:28.780 --> 04:29.841
You know I will.

04:29.941 --> 04:31.363
I ain't scared of hard work.

04:31.463 --> 04:33.085
That's what I like to hear.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.687
Bring your swim trunks
next week.

04:34.787 --> 04:36.849
We gonna start with 50 laps.

04:36.949 --> 04:39.492
Jackie, don't be late
for school.

04:39.592 --> 04:40.934
I know.

04:41.034 --> 04:43.537
Shit.

04:43.637 --> 04:45.299
Laps?

04:45.399 --> 04:49.064
Don't tell me
you don't know how to swim.

04:50.886 --> 04:52.948
Can't catch a break.

04:53.048 --> 04:55.051
That's gonna be fun to watch.

04:58.495 --> 05:00.397
Hmm.
Morning, bumblebee.

05:00.497 --> 05:03.721
I've been waiting for you.

05:03.821 --> 05:05.924
- It's from Ms. Hughes.
- Mm-hmm.

05:06.024 --> 05:08.226
She got some offers in Chicago
closer to her family.

05:10.149 --> 05:11.931
She's not coming
back to Bel-Air?

05:12.031 --> 05:15.215
I know it's not exactly
what you wanted,

05:15.315 --> 05:16.817
but she got
a great opportunity.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.780
And she's gonna get
a very nice settlement,

05:19.880 --> 05:21.582
and you're a big part of that.

05:21.682 --> 05:23.064
Hmm?

05:23.164 --> 05:24.306
I love you.

05:24.406 --> 05:25.787
I love you, too.

05:35.058 --> 05:38.282
<i>Ashley, thank you
for using your voice</i>

05:38.382 --> 05:40.004
<i>and helping me be seen.</i>

05:40.104 --> 05:42.247
<i>Never lose that special spark.</i>

05:42.347 --> 05:45.931
<i>Remember, our excellence
is everywhere.</i>

05:46.031 --> 05:47.814
<i>Love, Ms. Hughes.</i>

05:51.358 --> 05:53.861
<i>So information
on the seniors' trip</i>

05:53.961 --> 05:55.423
<i>will be out next month.</i>

06:03.692 --> 06:05.555
You're late.

06:05.655 --> 06:08.398
Easy, C.
First day back.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.480
<i>And the moment
you've all been waiting for:</i>

06:10.580 --> 06:12.523
<i>the nomination period
for Bel-Air Academy</i>

06:12.623 --> 06:14.605
<i>Founder's Award is closed.</i>

06:14.705 --> 06:17.048
<i>To be nominated, a student

06:17.148 --> 06:18.530
<i>put forward by either
a faculty member...</i>

06:18.630 --> 06:20.252
- You got this.
<i>- Or a student organization.</i>

06:20.352 --> 06:21.413
It's all you.

06:21.513 --> 06:22.815
<i>Here are

<i>♪ It's like déjà vu ♪</i>

06:53.712 --> 06:55.794

07:08.529 --> 07:10.432
No, for real, though,
West Philly for the win.

07:10.532 --> 07:12.074
Okay, you got this, bro.

07:12.174 --> 07:13.515
Congrats.
- Thank you, thank you.

07:13.615 --> 07:15.638
- I'll catch y'all later, okay?
- Congrats, Will.

07:15.738 --> 07:17.280
Guess you're
this year's wild card.

07:17.380 --> 07:19.162
Do you even know what
the Founder's Award is?

07:19.262 --> 07:20.363
Carlton, relax.

07:20.463 --> 07:22.406
Okay, I don't even know
how I got nominated.

07:22.506 --> 07:24.809
The BSU nominated you.

07:24.909 --> 07:25.810
Wait, for real?

07:25.910 --> 07:27.132
Seriously?

07:27.232 --> 07:28.934
Congratulations, you guys.

07:29.034 --> 07:30.496
Oh, yo, Lisa, can I holla
at you for a second?

07:30.596 --> 07:31.937
Yeah.

07:32.037 --> 07:33.059
Wait, so I'm just
supposed to pretend

07:33.159 --> 07:35.341
like this isn't personal?

07:35.441 --> 07:37.864
Canceling me out by bringing
my cousin into the competition

07:37.964 --> 07:40.147
just feels like
unnecessary sabotage.

07:40.247 --> 07:43.911
Will brings a perspective
that we've never seen before.

07:44.011 --> 07:45.153
I mean, it's nothing personal.

07:45.253 --> 07:46.434
He's just the right choice.

07:46.534 --> 07:49.478
And, hey, two Black students
were nominated.

07:49.578 --> 07:52.001
I mean, no matter what,
that's a good thing.

07:57.548 --> 08:00.171
Um, I offered
my services months ago,

08:00.271 --> 08:01.412
and you never took me up on it.

08:01.512 --> 08:02.854
Why the rush?

08:02.954 --> 08:04.456
Well, my AAU team is doing
laps this week,

08:04.556 --> 08:05.978
and I cannot be clowned.

08:06.078 --> 08:08.020
But I have a secret weapon:

08:08.120 --> 08:09.382
the number-one swimmer
at Bel-Air.

08:09.482 --> 08:11.184
Oh, are you sure
you're ready for this?

08:11.284 --> 08:14.067
Listen, I'm positive I'm not.

08:14.167 --> 08:16.230
But, you know,
I feel like I'm in good hands.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.032
What, you gotta get Drew's
permission or something?

08:18.132 --> 08:19.914
Drew?
Please?

08:20.014 --> 08:21.396
The way he came at Carlton,
he is not the guy

08:21.496 --> 08:22.718
I thought he was.

08:22.818 --> 08:24.960
I mean, I told you he wasn't
good enough for you.

08:25.060 --> 08:26.562
But that's none of my business.

08:26.662 --> 08:28.444
Look, are you coming
by the crib later or not?

08:30.667 --> 08:31.728
All right, fine.

08:31.828 --> 08:33.090
Yes, saved.

08:33.190 --> 08:34.331
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.533
I knew I could count
on my girl.

08:35.633 --> 08:37.135
Oh, so I'm your girl
when you want something?

08:37.235 --> 08:38.656
Come on, you know
you're always my ace.

08:38.756 --> 08:40.659
A'ight? Hey, don't do that.

08:40.759 --> 08:43.022
Appreciate you, girl.

08:43.122 --> 08:44.624

Everyone was at
that Fenty party last night.

08:51.452 --> 08:55.436
Yep, another influencer event
we didn't get invited to.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.400
I mean, at least with Kylo,
we walked red carpets

08:58.500 --> 09:00.803
and got swag bags
and Getty Images.

09:00.903 --> 09:02.365
Hello.

09:02.465 --> 09:04.127
I'm right here.

09:04.227 --> 09:06.450
Catch you later, Phanta.

09:06.550 --> 09:10.054
Look, you and Phanta
need to be patient, okay?

09:10.154 --> 09:12.497
I'm so close to closing
the Simply Spiked deal.

09:12.597 --> 09:15.060
You said that last week.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.663
I know what I said.

09:17.763 --> 09:20.306
Listen, if we just get
our numbers up a little bit

09:20.406 --> 09:22.028
and get a little more
engagement, we're there.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.550
Well,
we could get there faster

09:23.650 --> 09:24.992
if we could actually count
on Ivy's followers.

09:25.092 --> 09:26.874
We don't need Ivy.

09:31.579 --> 09:34.683
Look, I'm working really hard
to get us there, okay,

09:34.783 --> 09:36.325
and I will.

09:36.425 --> 09:37.286
Just trust.

09:42.232 --> 09:44.815
Only you could get nominated
for a Founder Award

09:44.915 --> 09:46.177
the same day
you finished suspension.

09:46.277 --> 09:47.618
My man.
What up, Ty?

09:47.718 --> 09:48.580
How are we doing?

09:48.680 --> 09:49.901
Welcome back.

09:50.001 --> 09:51.463
The team misses you.

09:51.563 --> 09:53.025
That's cap.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.707
All right, well, maybe
they didn't say that,

09:54.807 --> 09:56.229
but I can feel it.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.831
I tried to talk Coach into
giving you a second chance,

09:57.931 --> 09:59.032
but he wasn't having it.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.073
Sorry, man.

10:00.173 --> 10:01.114
Look, it's all good.

10:01.214 --> 10:02.516
It actually worked out.

10:02.616 --> 10:04.318
You know I'm playing
for Zenith Hype now.

10:04.418 --> 10:05.680
I watch them
on "House of Highlights,"

10:05.780 --> 10:07.042
like, all the time.

10:07.142 --> 10:08.243
They're, like, top five
in the AAU circuit.

10:08.343 --> 10:10.686
Yes, sir, and your boy
is out there killing it.

10:10.786 --> 10:12.368
No way. Damn.

10:12.468 --> 10:16.132
Well, I'm glad you found
a team that appreciates you.

10:16.232 --> 10:17.454
Maybe we could have
done that more.

10:17.554 --> 10:19.456
Tyler, trust me,
it's all good, man.

10:19.556 --> 10:20.778
All right?

10:20.878 --> 10:22.540
I'm glad everything's
working out for you, Will.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.541
I'll see you around.

10:23.641 --> 10:25.643
Yes, sir.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.282
Been studying the numbers.

10:44.666 --> 10:47.129
Our billables
from last quarter are down 30%.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.212
Mm-hmm, most of it
because your firm lost

10:49.312 --> 10:50.934
the Garrison Construction account.

10:51.034 --> 10:54.258
Yeah.

10:54.358 --> 10:57.742
Our biggest client.

10:57.842 --> 11:00.145
You know what?

11:00.245 --> 11:02.628
I'm sure Robert Garrison
would agree to a sit-down,

11:02.728 --> 11:05.491
let him know
you're back on the throne.

11:09.255 --> 11:11.959
If I can get
that business back,

11:12.059 --> 11:13.561
it'd calm a lot
of partner nerves.

11:13.661 --> 11:15.663
Maybe press pause
on this acquisition.

11:16.864 --> 11:18.566
Hm.

11:24.954 --> 11:27.017
It's good
to have you back, G.

11:34.405 --> 11:36.868
Congrats on your nom'.

11:36.968 --> 11:39.832
Too bad your sorry ass
won't win.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.794
Why?
'Cause you're going to?

11:41.894 --> 11:43.356
Nah.

11:43.456 --> 11:45.559
Thanks to your cousin's
woke-ass Malcolm X stunt,

11:45.659 --> 11:48.322
we're both gonna lose.

11:48.422 --> 11:50.424
Speak for yourself.

11:53.988 --> 11:59.315
Anyway, thought you might be
looking for a little escape.

12:01.317 --> 12:05.342
Nah, I'm good.

12:05.442 --> 12:09.587
I know we're not boys,
but I know you, Carlton.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.730
There's no way
you're good right now.

12:14.293 --> 12:16.956
Fuck off, Connor.

12:17.056 --> 12:18.918
Okay, man, whatever you say.

12:20.300 --> 12:23.003
Consider it a peace offering.

12:25.626 --> 12:26.687
Shit.

12:35.678 --> 12:37.180
Fuck.

13:13.403 --> 13:14.785
Hi, there.

13:14.885 --> 13:15.946
- Hey.
- The usual?

13:16.046 --> 13:19.850
- Yeah, two this time, neat.
- You got it.

13:23.855 --> 13:24.917
Erika?

13:25.017 --> 13:26.078
Philip?

13:26.178 --> 13:28.080
What are you--

13:32.666 --> 13:33.807
What are you doing here?

13:33.907 --> 13:35.409
Last I heard,
you were still in New York.

13:35.509 --> 13:38.092
Well, I transferred
to my firm's LA office.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.415
Okay.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.778
Well, please sit.
You got a minute?

13:42.878 --> 13:45.141
I--I've got a minute
before my lunch starts.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.262
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

13:46.362 --> 13:48.565
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.730
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:59.017 --> 14:00.359
Oban.

14:00.459 --> 14:02.842
One of your favorites,
if I remember correctly.

14:02.942 --> 14:05.285
You know,
that was for my client.

14:05.385 --> 14:07.127
No, I think
you mean my client.

14:07.227 --> 14:09.549
And Garrison isn't coming.

14:13.434 --> 14:15.136
So it was your firm
that poached him?

14:15.236 --> 14:17.239
Guilty.

14:24.407 --> 14:25.448
And then these are also
some older works,

14:25.448 --> 14:27.511
focusing on the cleansing power
of water,

14:27.611 --> 14:29.113
from the Middle Passage

14:29.213 --> 14:31.396
to the spiritual renewal
of baptism.

14:31.496 --> 14:35.080
And that'll all be here,
on the east walls of the space.

14:35.180 --> 14:37.182
Uh-huh.

14:39.145 --> 14:42.208
And of course, there'll be
plenty of champagne,

14:42.308 --> 14:45.252
so it should all flow
quite nicely.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.734
It all sounds good.

14:46.834 --> 14:49.457
Oh, okay, great.

14:49.557 --> 14:51.620
Just a few thoughts.

14:51.720 --> 14:52.981
May I?

14:53.081 --> 14:55.084
Oh.

14:56.365 --> 14:59.990
The arrangement of the space
here is a bit disorienting.

15:01.611 --> 15:05.556
I feel that the series starts
with potential

15:05.656 --> 15:08.920
and then stops too abruptly.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.802
No, where is the ascension?

15:10.902 --> 15:15.007
If you start back here
with these...

15:17.270 --> 15:20.093
No, listen, listen,
I have to say out of respect,

15:20.193 --> 15:21.535
I would have never stolen Garrison

15:21.635 --> 15:22.897
if you were still at the firm.

15:22.997 --> 15:24.258
And you never would
have got him if I was.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.301
Ahh, there's that confidence.

15:28.563 --> 15:32.188
So I take it you're back.

15:32.288 --> 15:33.790
I am.

15:33.890 --> 15:36.993
Yeah, the DA race
didn't quite go my way.

15:37.093 --> 15:39.096
I heard.

15:41.218 --> 15:42.720
How's Viv?

15:42.820 --> 15:44.522
Very well.

15:44.622 --> 15:48.007
She's back focusing
on her art.

15:48.107 --> 15:50.409
And what about you
and... Chris, was it?

15:50.509 --> 15:51.811
Oh, yeah.

15:51.911 --> 15:53.894
Thought about kids,
a last-ditch effort

15:53.994 --> 15:55.696
to save our marriage.

15:55.796 --> 15:58.059
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

15:58.159 --> 15:59.260
And then there was Adam.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.062
Yeah, he didn't want kids.

16:01.162 --> 16:03.105
Now he's living
with his 25-year-old trainer

16:03.205 --> 16:04.106
with twins on the way.

16:04.206 --> 16:06.148
So there you go.

16:06.248 --> 16:10.473
Two failed marriages,
no kids, and a kick-ass job.

16:10.573 --> 16:12.576
Now you're up to date.

16:13.016 --> 16:14.758
Wow.

16:14.858 --> 16:17.762
Sad, I know.

16:17.862 --> 16:20.766
Guess I just didn't choose
the right guy.

16:20.866 --> 16:23.989
So should we address
the elephant in the room?

16:25.351 --> 16:27.934
Robert.

16:28.034 --> 16:30.016
Yes, Robert.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.702
I will get my client back.
- Hmm.

16:34.802 --> 16:35.623
Mm-mm-mm.

16:35.723 --> 16:36.945
He's a huge piece of business,

16:37.045 --> 16:39.468
and I'm not giving up
my client.

16:39.568 --> 16:41.790
But I'm reasonable.

16:41.890 --> 16:44.233
There is one way
you can get him back.

16:49.740 --> 16:51.402
Whenever you're ready.

16:51.502 --> 16:53.484
I'm gonna need you
to lean back again.

16:53.584 --> 16:54.806
All right.

16:54.906 --> 16:57.209
Remember,
your body's only tense

16:57.309 --> 16:58.971
'cause you're in your head.

16:59.071 --> 17:01.133
Just close your eyes
and think about something

17:01.233 --> 17:02.655
that brings you peace.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.217
I'm not gonna lie.

17:04.317 --> 17:05.519
The only thing that's
bringing me peace right now

17:05.519 --> 17:07.601
is your voice.

17:08.802 --> 17:11.426
So focus on my voice.

17:16.091 --> 17:20.516
Before you entered this world,
you were immersed in water,

17:20.616 --> 17:25.042
so you're just resisting
your natural state.

17:25.142 --> 17:29.287
And the water will always
carry you if you allow it to.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.816
Open your eyes.

17:36.916 --> 17:38.177
Oh, shit.

17:38.277 --> 17:39.179
Am I floating?

17:39.279 --> 17:40.420
You're floating.

17:40.520 --> 17:41.862
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

17:41.962 --> 17:42.943
All by myself?

17:43.043 --> 17:43.984
All by yourself.

17:46.407 --> 17:47.909
That's crazy.

17:48.009 --> 17:50.312
Whoo!

17:50.412 --> 17:52.755
As much as I love hearing
about your work problems,

17:52.855 --> 17:54.997
Janice just reworked
the entire show,

17:55.097 --> 17:58.962
and now I gotta make it
all make sense.

17:59.062 --> 18:01.886
Mom, seriously?

18:01.986 --> 18:05.610
Okay, you have
my undivided attention.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.652
Ten minutes, go.

18:07.752 --> 18:11.657
So, listen, if I had
Ivy's 10 million followers,

18:11.757 --> 18:13.740
I would've closed
this deal already.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.021
I mean, I don't know
what to do.

18:15.121 --> 18:16.663
Maybe I should just give up
and find

18:16.763 --> 18:18.305
another deal she can endorse.

18:18.405 --> 18:21.189
Or you can dig in.

18:21.289 --> 18:24.633
Look, if Phanta and Monica see
that you're the first

18:24.733 --> 18:28.798
to get the house sponsor
on your own, without Ivy,

18:28.898 --> 18:30.800
they'll see that you're a boss.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.683
Look, trust your gut.

18:33.783 --> 18:37.007
See where it takes you.

18:37.107 --> 18:39.450
Hmm.

18:39.550 --> 18:41.493
Okay, well, then in that case,

18:41.593 --> 18:43.415
I could use an opportunity
for the house

18:43.515 --> 18:45.257
to gain some publicity fast.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.860
Mm-hmm.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.264
You know,
like a high-end event,

18:51.364 --> 18:53.507
something in the next two days
if possible.

18:53.607 --> 18:54.869
Any ideas?
- Nothing comes to my mind.

18:54.969 --> 18:56.150
Mama!

18:56.250 --> 18:59.394
Okay, yes, you can use
my event however you need.

18:59.494 --> 19:00.796
Thank you.
Thank you.

19:00.896 --> 19:02.117
And I promise you
it'll be easy.

19:02.217 --> 19:03.359
We're not gonna mess up
your plans.

19:03.459 --> 19:05.201
Yeah, I mean,
I've pivoted a million times.

19:05.301 --> 19:07.524
What's one more?

19:07.624 --> 19:11.248
Listen, Mom,
you're a boss, too, okay?

19:11.348 --> 19:13.050
You need to flex a little bit.

19:13.150 --> 19:14.892
I mean, why should
everybody else

19:14.992 --> 19:18.377
get their vision if it means
losing sight of your own?

19:18.477 --> 19:21.700
You need to trust your gut,
see where it takes you.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.223
I see what you did there.

19:24.323 --> 19:26.546
Trying to be like you.

19:26.646 --> 19:28.068
Okay, let's go again.
Let's try again.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.350
Come on, swim to me.
- Come on, come on.

19:29.450 --> 19:30.351
I need a break. Chill.

19:30.451 --> 19:31.672
Oh, you need a break?

19:31.772 --> 19:33.154
Oh, sorry, let me just--

19:33.254 --> 19:34.556
no, no, no, no,
there's no breaks in my class.

19:34.656 --> 19:36.478
- Did you just--
- Let's go, Smith.

19:36.578 --> 19:37.559
What you gonna do about it?

19:37.659 --> 19:39.001
She did it again.

19:39.101 --> 19:40.763
Okay.
What am I gonna do about it?

19:40.863 --> 19:42.165
I'm gonna swim.

19:42.265 --> 19:46.690
<i>♪ Just that I'm
focusing on you and I ♪</i>

19:46.790 --> 19:49.133
<i>♪ Catching feelings so deep ♪</i>

19:49.233 --> 19:50.815
Really?
No, wait!

19:50.915 --> 19:54.299
Got yo' ass.

19:54.399 --> 19:55.821
Will!

19:55.921 --> 19:57.583
Look at what you just did.

19:57.683 --> 19:59.585
What?

19:59.685 --> 20:00.827
Oh, shit.

20:00.927 --> 20:02.149
Yo, I did that!
- Yes!

20:02.249 --> 20:03.790
How I get over here?
That's crazy!

20:03.890 --> 20:05.432
- Yes!
- Yay!

20:05.532 --> 20:06.954
You a great teacher.

20:07.054 --> 20:10.398
<i>♪ Just knowing
no one else above you ♪</i>

20:10.498 --> 20:13.562
<i>♪ You put in work
so I can trust you ♪</i>

20:13.662 --> 20:17.647
<i>♪ And now it's time
for me to love you ♪</i>

20:17.747 --> 20:20.370
So anyway,
you can just practice swimming

20:20.470 --> 20:22.613
for about an hour a day,
and you should be set

20:22.713 --> 20:24.455
for Zenith next week.

20:24.555 --> 20:26.337
Hey, thanks, Lis.

20:26.437 --> 20:27.338
I really appreciate this.

20:27.438 --> 20:28.900
I really owe you one.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.823
I mean, you're not gonna win
any relay races,

20:30.923 --> 20:32.465
but at least you won't drown.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.387
I'll take it.
I'll take it.

20:34.487 --> 20:36.950
I really need to make
this AAU thing work.

20:37.050 --> 20:39.393
I really don't have
any backup plans.

20:39.493 --> 20:43.438
I mean, anything can work
if you want it bad enough.

20:43.538 --> 20:46.601
<i>♪ Any question, you're
the answer, you the standard ♪</i>

20:46.701 --> 20:49.405
Yeah, guess you're right.

20:50.746 --> 20:53.169
Will!

20:53.269 --> 20:54.931
You deserve a Medal of Honor
for getting

20:55.031 --> 20:57.054
Will near the water,
much less in it.

20:57.154 --> 21:00.978
Amazing what we can do
when we are motivated.

21:01.078 --> 21:03.341
And I see you're on fire.

21:03.441 --> 21:05.624
I love the way
you're changing up the art show

21:05.724 --> 21:07.626
to make it your own.

21:07.726 --> 21:09.268
"Excellence Is Everywhere."

21:09.368 --> 21:10.830
I like it.

21:10.930 --> 21:13.433
Ah, it's the new theme,
inspired by Ashley,

21:13.533 --> 21:16.957
and the space is big enough
to feature all my art

21:17.057 --> 21:19.641
and share the limelight
with new talent.

21:19.741 --> 21:21.843
So what's Janice
think about all this?

21:21.943 --> 21:22.804
I don't know.
I guess we'll see

21:22.904 --> 21:24.366
when she shows up.

21:24.466 --> 21:26.489
I'll start mocking up
a new catalog.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.131
Oh, thank you, Lisa.

21:28.231 --> 21:31.575
I need all hands on deck
and a miracle from Jesus

21:31.675 --> 21:32.976
to pull this all off.

21:33.076 --> 21:35.259
And congrats, by the way.

21:35.359 --> 21:37.942
It's so cool that both Will
and Carlton got nominated

21:38.042 --> 21:39.624
for the Founder's Award.

21:39.724 --> 21:41.306
What?

21:41.406 --> 21:43.749
I had no idea.

21:43.849 --> 21:46.472
Maybe they were
making it a surprise.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.315
Forget I said anything.

21:48.415 --> 21:50.317
Just hopefully, they won't
be at each other's throats,

21:50.417 --> 21:53.340
especially after what happened
with Carlton at the protest.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.706
Wait, what happened
at the protest?

21:59.828 --> 22:01.831
Lisa.

22:06.556 --> 22:08.338
Yeah?

22:08.438 --> 22:10.701
Yo, C.

22:10.801 --> 22:13.144
Can I bother you for a second?

22:13.244 --> 22:15.147
What's up?

22:15.247 --> 22:17.950
I'm just checking
on you, man.

22:18.050 --> 22:21.154
Anything, um, interesting
happen in your day?

22:21.254 --> 22:22.756
You mean besides
you getting nominated

22:22.856 --> 22:25.679
for the school's highest award
and having no idea what it is?

22:25.779 --> 22:27.441
No.

22:27.541 --> 22:29.544
Is that what your boy Connor
was all in your ear about?

22:31.426 --> 22:33.168
You spying on me?

22:33.268 --> 22:34.169
No, man.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.271
I'm just making sure you good.

22:38.835 --> 22:41.338
Look, C, deading
that nut-ass friendship

22:41.438 --> 22:43.340
was the best thing to happen
to you, okay?

22:43.440 --> 22:44.902
I know how you and Connor
used to party,

22:45.002 --> 22:46.384
so I'm just making sure
you straight.

22:46.484 --> 22:48.466
Look, I don't want anything
to do with Connor

22:48.566 --> 22:50.568
or any of his bullshit.

22:52.130 --> 22:53.832
- Yeah?
- Yes.

22:53.932 --> 22:55.194
All right, that was the old me.

22:55.294 --> 22:57.156
I have no interest
in going back there.

22:57.256 --> 22:58.758
Okay.

22:58.858 --> 23:01.001
I believe you.

23:01.101 --> 23:03.103
Glad to hear it, man.

23:10.392 --> 23:12.134
Can I get back
to working out?

23:12.234 --> 23:14.237
Go ahead. Superman.

23:19.323 --> 23:23.127
Hey, honey,
I am so sorry I'm late.

23:25.210 --> 23:28.514
- We need to talk.
- What's going on?

23:28.614 --> 23:33.440
Carlton had another
panic attack at the protest...

23:33.540 --> 23:36.363
and Will knew all about it.

23:36.463 --> 23:39.567
Well, did you talk
to him yet?

23:39.667 --> 23:42.310
Just waiting on you
so we can game plan.

23:44.753 --> 23:46.976
Okay.

23:52.762 --> 23:57.388
Hey, heard the good news.

23:57.488 --> 23:59.631
Founder's Award?

23:59.731 --> 24:01.393
Congratulations.

24:01.493 --> 24:05.498
Um, why do I feel like
there's about to be a but?

24:06.899 --> 24:08.401
I heard about
the panic attack

24:08.501 --> 24:10.443
at the protest.

24:11.945 --> 24:13.247
<i>I'm sorry I didn't tell you.</i>

24:16.591 --> 24:19.654
Look, I realize
that I probably put you

24:19.754 --> 24:21.937
in a bad position.

24:22.037 --> 24:23.139
You're looking out
for your cousin

24:23.239 --> 24:25.221
without betraying his trust.
I get it.

24:25.321 --> 24:27.384
I mean, I thought I was
helping him find a new lane

24:27.484 --> 24:29.486
with this protest thing.

24:31.849 --> 24:33.851
I don't know.

24:35.053 --> 24:36.514
Maybe I pushed too hard.

24:36.614 --> 24:39.718
I just didn't want
you guys to overreact.

24:39.818 --> 24:42.482
And I know it was wrong
of me to keep it from you,

24:42.582 --> 24:44.884
and I'm sorry,
but even Dr. Richardson says

24:44.984 --> 24:46.807
it takes time.

24:46.907 --> 24:51.332
I'll have good days
and bad days.

24:51.432 --> 24:53.375
<i>We don't ask
to be role models.</i>

24:55.477 --> 25:00.583
Like it or not,
you're that person for Carlton.

25:00.683 --> 25:02.265
You know, he puts a lot
of pressure on himself

25:02.365 --> 25:04.508
to be stronger
because he sees you winning,

25:04.608 --> 25:06.830
like your nomination
for the Founder's Award.

25:08.933 --> 25:11.476
I just got thrown in the mix.

25:11.576 --> 25:13.158
I didn't ask for that.

25:13.258 --> 25:15.881
I don't want this
to overshadow your nomination

25:15.981 --> 25:17.884
for the Founder's Award.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.807
I mean, that is
a great accomplishment.

25:20.907 --> 25:23.691
Right, so why don't we
just focus on the good things

25:23.791 --> 25:25.172
that are happening in my life?

25:25.272 --> 25:28.216
Your father and I
are both very proud of you.

25:28.316 --> 25:30.859
I mean, we know how much
this means to you.

25:30.959 --> 25:32.901
<i>I don't care about
the Founder's Award, okay?</i>

25:33.001 --> 25:35.985
I'm focused on AAU,
and that's it.

25:36.085 --> 25:37.507
Founder's Award
is Carlton's thing.

25:37.607 --> 25:39.930
Well, it's still
an honor to be proud of.

25:43.374 --> 25:45.236
But, yes, if you're not
passionate about it,

25:45.336 --> 25:47.338
just know that it means
the world to Carlton.

25:48.099 --> 25:49.641
Easy.

25:49.741 --> 25:52.685
I will gladly take myself
out of the running.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.247
Look, trust me, Uncle Phil.

25:54.347 --> 25:56.489
I want what's best
for Carlton, too.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.051
Okay?

25:58.151 --> 25:59.453
Don't worry.

25:59.553 --> 26:01.736
Don't worry.

26:01.836 --> 26:05.140
I just need you to have faith
and believe in the decision

26:05.240 --> 26:06.902
that we've all made.

26:07.002 --> 26:11.147
Okay.

26:11.247 --> 26:14.150
I believe you.

26:25.784 --> 26:28.407
<i>♪ Saved from

26:28.507 --> 26:33.974

26:34.074 --> 26:36.657
<i>♪ If you feel just like me ♪</i>

26:36.757 --> 26:37.698
I talked to the bartenders.

26:37.798 --> 26:39.220
They're bringing out
more champagne.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.822
So far, so good.

26:40.922 --> 26:41.984
Better than good.

26:42.084 --> 26:43.906
Look at what you did.

26:44.006 --> 26:45.468
Uh-oh, incoming.

26:45.568 --> 26:47.190
What?

26:47.290 --> 26:49.913
Interesting
what you've done, Vivian.

26:50.013 --> 26:51.475
Different from what
we discussed.

26:51.575 --> 26:53.998
I have some questions
about these artists over here.

26:54.098 --> 26:56.481
Wow.
Afternoon, Janice.

26:56.581 --> 26:59.484
I must say, you are
looking stunning today.

26:59.584 --> 27:00.646
Thank you.

27:00.746 --> 27:02.448
Um, Janice,
you remember Geoffrey.

27:02.548 --> 27:03.970
You two met
at my last art exhibit.

27:04.070 --> 27:05.451
Oh, yeah.

27:05.551 --> 27:07.294
Pretty impressive
what she's achieved, right?

27:07.394 --> 27:09.456
- Absolutely.
- Well, Janice.

27:09.556 --> 27:11.539
Can I borrow you for a minute?

27:11.639 --> 27:12.980
I'd love to show you
my favorite piece.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.502
I'd be delighted.

27:14.602 --> 27:17.105
<i>♪ Find your own kind

27:17.205 --> 27:18.267

27:18.367 --> 27:19.788
Who's this one by?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.310
It doesn't say.

27:21.410 --> 27:23.473
This one is amazing.

27:23.573 --> 27:25.836
It really speaks
to the silencing

27:25.936 --> 27:27.878
of the female voice.

27:27.978 --> 27:29.240
Pretty powerful.

27:29.340 --> 27:31.322
That's perfect, you guys.
I love to see it.

27:31.422 --> 27:32.724
Keep posting, okay?

27:32.824 --> 27:34.646
Talk to the artists,
start conversations,

27:34.746 --> 27:35.968
and tag them, okay.

27:36.068 --> 27:38.130
Visibility for the artist,
visibility for the house.

27:38.230 --> 27:39.492
Well, who's this artist?

27:39.592 --> 27:40.934
We wanna tag them,
but it says anonymous.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.376
What?

27:43.476 --> 27:46.420
Hey, Doc.
So good to see you.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.262
And thank you so much again
for giving Will the opportunity

27:48.362 --> 27:49.304
to be on your team.

27:49.404 --> 27:50.425
Oh, it's no problem.

27:50.525 --> 27:51.987
I was just dropping
my niece off.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.348
I should be thanking you
for giving her

27:53.448 --> 27:54.830
this opportunity.
- Oh, please.

27:54.930 --> 27:56.312
Will told me how great she is.

27:56.412 --> 27:58.675
Besides I was looking
for a performative aspect

27:58.775 --> 28:01.558
to add to my art show
on the last minute.

28:01.658 --> 28:03.080
We should definitely take
a picture on this one.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.803
- Yo, uh, Hil?
- What?

28:05.903 --> 28:07.405
Like, this is super cool,

28:07.505 --> 28:09.207
and we love your mom
and all, but--

28:09.307 --> 28:11.450
And, like, we really
appreciate the invite,

28:11.550 --> 28:14.614
but this isn't exactly
the influencer splash

28:14.714 --> 28:15.815
we were hoping for.

28:15.915 --> 28:18.378
I totally get that,
but you guys trust me.

28:18.478 --> 28:20.501
I have a big surprise
coming, okay?

28:20.601 --> 28:22.343
- Okay.
- Let's take a picture first.

28:22.443 --> 28:24.465

you need anything.

28:33.456 --> 28:34.397

28:34.497 --> 28:36.079
Absolutely.
I can show you.

28:36.179 --> 28:38.382
I'm Lisa.
- Jackie.

28:39.503 --> 28:41.405
I don't know
why I'm so nervous.

28:41.505 --> 28:43.968
This couldn't be
a friendlier crowd.

28:44.068 --> 28:45.891

28:45.991 --> 28:47.993

28:48.554 --> 28:50.056

28:50.156 --> 28:52.478
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome, girl.

28:54.601 --> 28:56.704
Yo, Doc.

28:56.804 --> 28:58.346
Oh, just wanna tap in
with you real quick.

28:58.446 --> 29:01.029
Hey.

29:01.129 --> 29:03.592
Ah, you still feeling the pain
from that workout.

29:03.692 --> 29:06.235
I'm not gonna lie.
Sitting's a little rough.

29:06.335 --> 29:09.359
Look, I know the guys
are pretty tough on you.

29:09.459 --> 29:10.840
Don't let them get
in your head too much.

29:10.940 --> 29:11.962
Nah, it's all good.

29:12.062 --> 29:13.283
I ain't tripping, you know.

New kid from Bel-Air Academy
and all, I get it.

29:15.025 --> 29:17.769
Okay, but that academic piece
is important, too, man.

29:17.869 --> 29:20.171
That school's gonna open up
a lot of doors for you,

29:20.271 --> 29:22.534
doors those guys
will never see.

29:22.634 --> 29:24.497
Hmm.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.779
Yeah, I guess I never thought
about it like that.

29:26.879 --> 29:29.262
Well, you know, I actually
am nominated for

29:29.362 --> 29:30.784
the school leadership award.
- Okay.

29:30.884 --> 29:32.426
Yeah, it's
a pretty big deal, apparently.

29:32.526 --> 29:34.428
Yeah, but it's more
of my cousin's thing.

29:34.528 --> 29:38.473
You got leadership skills,
too, and D1 schools--

29:38.573 --> 29:40.476
they looking for that.

the first published

30:17.780 --> 30:22.445
She started writing poetry
in the 1700s,

30:22.545 --> 30:25.089
around the same age as you.

30:25.189 --> 30:26.450

Mm, no, she was enslaved.

We didn't choose that.

30:31.116 --> 30:32.978
Wow.

30:33.078 --> 30:35.261
I can't believe I never learned
about her in school.

30:35.361 --> 30:38.104
Yeah, well,
that's why it's important

30:38.204 --> 30:41.268
that we educate ourselves.

30:41.368 --> 30:45.353
I'm so happy Miss Hughes
taught you that too.

30:45.453 --> 30:47.455
Our excellence is everywhere.

30:52.301 --> 30:54.524
How'd it go with Garrison?

30:54.624 --> 30:58.088
He never showed, but the lawyer
who stole him did.

30:58.188 --> 31:00.010
Champagne, gentlemen?

31:00.110 --> 31:02.934
Thank you.
Erika Baker.

31:03.034 --> 31:05.577
- Boy...
- Exactly.

31:05.677 --> 31:08.060
She's working in LA.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.663
And how'd it go with that?

31:10.763 --> 31:12.705
Well, she said James
and the firm

31:12.805 --> 31:14.507
could have
the Garrison account,

31:14.607 --> 31:17.831
but she wants me to join
her firm as a senior partner

31:17.931 --> 31:19.934
or at least be open
to a meeting.

31:21.536 --> 31:23.638
Have you spoke
to Viv about this?

31:23.738 --> 31:26.822
Well, not until
there's anything to say.

31:35.993 --> 31:37.174
<i>Okay, wait.</i>

31:37.274 --> 31:38.336
Him?

31:38.436 --> 31:39.697
- Real estate agent.
- Okay.

31:39.797 --> 31:41.019
Single.

31:41.119 --> 31:42.340
Not from LA.
- Mm-hmm.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.782
Vegan.

31:45.364 --> 31:47.026
Your turn.
- All right.

31:47.126 --> 31:49.028
Ah, right here,

31:49.128 --> 31:51.471
the Shaft-looking motherfucker
right here,

31:51.571 --> 31:53.474
probably rode in
from some Midwestern town,

31:53.574 --> 31:55.236
trying to be an actor.

31:55.336 --> 31:56.477
He's bartending now,
though, you know,

31:56.577 --> 31:57.639
but you know how that go.

31:57.739 --> 31:59.120
He probably a life coach.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.368
Oh, shit.

32:05.468 --> 32:06.930
Yo, that's--

32:07.030 --> 32:08.972
LaMarcus Alton.

32:09.072 --> 32:11.074
Hilary Banks.

32:12.076 --> 32:13.417
Wait a minute.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.139
Oh, my God.

32:15.239 --> 32:18.183
I know this not LaMarcus "Most
Receptions in the Rose Bowl,

32:18.283 --> 32:19.985
Touchdowns Received" Alton.

32:20.085 --> 32:21.467
What's good, baby?

32:21.567 --> 32:23.830
Man, hey, I won big
this year in fantasy.

32:23.930 --> 32:25.472
You was my first pick,
dawg, for real.

32:25.572 --> 32:26.993
I appreciate you.

32:27.093 --> 32:28.495
Didn't you just get traded
from the Eagles to the Rams?

32:28.495 --> 32:30.438
Thanks, man. Yes.

32:30.538 --> 32:31.759
And I'm happy to be back in LA.

32:31.859 --> 32:33.281
Oh, man, that's dope.

32:33.381 --> 32:36.405
So, I mean, how you know
the Banks family?

32:36.505 --> 32:38.507
I'm Hilary's ex.

32:40.870 --> 32:42.852
Hillar--Hillary's ex.
Ex what?

32:42.952 --> 32:44.975
LaMarcus is my ex-boyfriend.

32:45.075 --> 32:49.780
But, LaMarcus,
meet Jazz, my boyfriend.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.883
Wow.

32:52.964 --> 32:54.967
Okay.

33:02.776 --> 33:05.239
Oh, thank you.
Hello, everyone.

33:05.339 --> 33:07.361
Thank you so much for coming.

33:07.461 --> 33:09.844
You know,
as this year's fellow,

33:09.944 --> 33:14.290
I get the opportunity
to mentor, lecture,

33:14.390 --> 33:19.215
and curate exhibits all thanks
to the support and resources

33:19.315 --> 33:20.897
of the Nieman Fellowship.

33:20.997 --> 33:23.000
Thank you.

33:24.522 --> 33:26.384
You know, I spent
my undergraduate years

33:26.484 --> 33:28.426
in Washington, D.C.,

33:28.526 --> 33:30.789
at Howard University,
the mecca--

33:30.889 --> 33:34.033
- HU!
- You know!

33:34.133 --> 33:35.675
And while I was there,

33:35.775 --> 33:38.158
I was exposed
to the rich legacy

33:38.258 --> 33:40.040
of the Barnett Aden Gallery,

33:40.140 --> 33:43.805
the first privately-owned
Black gallery in the U.S.,

33:43.905 --> 33:45.927
a space that helped launch

33:46.027 --> 33:49.451
the careers of Romare Bearden,
Charles White,

33:49.551 --> 33:52.215
Elizabeth Catlett,
and so many others.

33:52.315 --> 33:54.537
I wish to create a legacy

33:54.637 --> 33:56.300
that lives up
to that history...

33:58.041 --> 34:03.228
A place where we are all
respected, heard, and welcome.

34:03.328 --> 34:04.629
And listen, y'all,
that starts tonight.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.236
Tonight, I have curated
a collection that includes

34:10.336 --> 34:14.561
my own work, but also the work
of emerging photographers,

34:14.661 --> 34:18.125
painters, sculptors,
and, yes, even dance,

34:18.225 --> 34:22.411
speaking of which, please

So LaMarcus Alton's
your ex-boyfriend.

35:48.453 --> 35:49.955
Why'd y'all break up?

35:50.055 --> 35:52.197
Well, he got drafted
to Philly,

35:52.297 --> 35:54.920
and I didn't wanna do
the long distance anymore.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.562
Oh, so if he would
have never left,

35:56.662 --> 35:57.844
y'all would have still been
together, right?

35:57.944 --> 35:59.886
'Cause, I mean, he here.

35:59.986 --> 36:03.531
I don't care where
LaMarcus is, okay?

36:03.631 --> 36:05.012
I'm happy where I am.

36:05.112 --> 36:07.055
But you invited
him here, Hillary.

36:07.155 --> 36:09.538
Yes, but that was
strictly professional.

36:09.638 --> 36:11.140
I mean, I wanted this
to go viral.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.062
LaMarcus has millions
of followers.

36:13.162 --> 36:14.904
If he just tags
the influencer house,

36:15.004 --> 36:16.146
the whole world will know us.

36:16.246 --> 36:18.108
When you said
that you had a surprise,

36:18.208 --> 36:20.751
I did not know that you meant
a 6'5" god.

36:20.851 --> 36:22.473
The pic I just posted
of you and LaMarcus

36:22.573 --> 36:24.275
got 6,000 likes in 15 minutes.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.558
Like, this is--this is
gonna be huge for us.

36:26.658 --> 36:28.080
We should get
some footage, yeah.

36:28.180 --> 36:29.201
Um, yes.

36:29.301 --> 36:30.603
You guys go ahead,
and I'll just--

36:30.703 --> 36:31.804
just give me one second.

36:31.904 --> 36:33.126
No, no, hey, we good.

36:33.226 --> 36:34.327
Go do your thing.

36:34.427 --> 36:35.569
Are you sure?

36:35.669 --> 36:37.571
I'll be right here.

36:37.671 --> 36:39.673
Okay.

36:41.476 --> 36:43.478
Bye.

36:46.001 --> 36:47.943
Hey, what's up, Frat?

36:48.043 --> 36:49.265
Welcome back.
- Hey.

36:49.365 --> 36:51.428
- How you doing?
- Banks, how you doing?

36:51.528 --> 36:53.150
Good to see you.
Been a while.

36:53.250 --> 36:55.272
- How are your parents doing?
- Mrs. Banks.

36:55.372 --> 36:56.954
Please tell them
we said hello.

36:57.054 --> 36:58.716
It's been a minute.
- I know, I'm sorry.

36:58.816 --> 36:59.757
How you doing?

36:59.857 --> 37:01.239
We'll see.
How you been, man?

37:03.021 --> 37:03.742
Thank you so much
for being here.

37:03.742 --> 37:05.124
Yeah.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.646
Will you be hanging
around the house more?

37:06.746 --> 37:08.448
Congratulations, you guys.

37:08.548 --> 37:09.970
Thank you.
Thank you.

37:10.070 --> 37:12.413
- Wow.
- Hey, Lisa.

37:12.513 --> 37:14.495
Thank you for
the encouragement earlier.

37:14.595 --> 37:16.217
Of course.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.700
All of you did amazing, and I
told you they would love you.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.782
You did, and they did.

37:20.882 --> 37:22.585
- They did!
- Y'all killed it.

37:22.685 --> 37:24.187
Murdered it.
- Thank you.

37:24.287 --> 37:26.309
That was dope.
That was dope.

37:26.409 --> 37:28.311
- Hey, Little Miss Body Roll.
- Mm-hmm.

37:28.411 --> 37:30.874
I see you.

37:34.459 --> 37:38.644
Oh, Lisa, this is Jackie.

37:38.744 --> 37:41.287
This is my--
- We met.

37:41.387 --> 37:43.409
I didn't know you two

38:02.532 --> 38:03.673
We just friends.

38:07.778 --> 38:11.483
I mean, we--we had a thing,

38:11.583 --> 38:13.585
but we're cool.
Trust me.

38:16.749 --> 38:19.853
Maybe you are, but she ain't.

38:31.486 --> 38:33.269
Lisa!

38:33.369 --> 38:36.232
Aunt Viv told me
you were still here.

38:36.332 --> 38:39.276
Just taking care of things
before I head home.

38:39.376 --> 38:41.378
Nice.

38:45.543 --> 38:46.644
You need some help?

38:46.744 --> 38:48.747
Nope.

38:56.476 --> 39:00.461
Look, I'm sorry
about earlier with Jackie--

39:00.561 --> 39:03.504
Please stop.

39:03.604 --> 39:06.428
Stop what?

39:06.528 --> 39:08.190
Are you--are you mad?

39:08.290 --> 39:10.593
I mean, Lisa, I thought
you genuinely moved on.

39:10.693 --> 39:12.515
I mean, you been kicking it
with Drew this whole time.

39:12.615 --> 39:14.798
I'm not mad.

39:14.898 --> 39:20.004
I feel stupid
for being that girl.

39:20.104 --> 39:21.806
What are you talking about?

39:21.906 --> 39:23.889
That girl
that's holding out hope

39:23.989 --> 39:25.451
for the guy
that broke her heart

39:25.551 --> 39:27.553
who might still have feelings
for her too.

39:30.757 --> 39:34.181
Look, I'm sorry.

39:34.281 --> 39:36.504
You know I'd never
intentionally try to hurt you.

39:36.604 --> 39:38.146
It's not even on you.

39:38.246 --> 39:41.950
I got sucked back in.

39:42.050 --> 39:42.991
I mean, it's easy with us.

39:43.091 --> 39:44.994
I mean, I was just happy

39:45.094 --> 39:47.236
that we were trying
to be cool again.

39:47.336 --> 39:49.159
You know, you're literally
the best friend

39:49.259 --> 39:51.882
that I've made out here.

39:55.746 --> 39:58.690
And that's nice.

39:58.790 --> 40:01.934
But it's not gonna work
for me anymore, Will.

40:02.034 --> 40:04.417
I tried, and I can't.

40:10.083 --> 40:11.906
So what are you saying?

40:20.095 --> 40:23.359
We can't be friends anymore.

40:40.119 --> 40:43.323
I am really,
really proud of you.

40:48.930 --> 40:51.753
You worked hard,
and it paid off.

40:51.853 --> 40:54.356
Thank you.

40:54.456 --> 40:56.559
I know you said
you wanted your--

40:56.659 --> 41:00.483
your art to say something,
and this definitely does.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.925
Yeah.

41:02.025 --> 41:05.049
Well, Janice isn't ready

41:05.149 --> 41:08.553
for this Viv, not yet.

41:10.675 --> 41:12.678
I mean, it's powerful.

41:14.560 --> 41:17.344
I know you're focused
on giving other people a voice,

41:17.444 --> 41:20.107
but don't forget
about your own.

41:20.207 --> 41:22.590
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

41:22.690 --> 41:24.692
Baby steps.

41:29.578 --> 41:32.281
What's wrong?

41:32.381 --> 41:33.523
Well, I didn't wanna ruin
the night

41:33.623 --> 41:37.007
by saying anything
earlier, but...

41:37.107 --> 41:39.410
we have a problem
with Geoffrey.

41:43.755 --> 41:46.018
- Well, we did it.
- Yeah, we did.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.423
And our deal
is officially closed.

41:50.523 --> 41:53.386

41:53.486 --> 41:55.629
You know, that livestream
with LaMarcus

41:55.729 --> 41:56.951
really did the trick.

41:57.051 --> 41:58.913
I told you guys
I would handle it.

41:59.013 --> 42:00.355
We knew you would.

42:00.455 --> 42:02.677
Never doubted you, boss.

42:02.777 --> 42:04.480
Cheers.

42:04.580 --> 42:06.322
Okay, so post this
and then let me know

42:06.422 --> 42:07.884
