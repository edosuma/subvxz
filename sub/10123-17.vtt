WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:02.000
HI, DAD.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.200
WHOA, HO, HO.
WHAT, BASEBALL?

00:04.200 --> 00:08.300
IN THIS STORM?
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.300
DAD,
THAT'S A DRIZZLE.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.467
[THUNDER]

00:12.467 --> 00:15.133
A THUNDERY, STORMY
KIND OF DRIZZLE.

00:15.133 --> 00:16.467
MM-HMM. FORGET IT,
WISE GUY.

00:16.467 --> 00:17.667
FIND SOMETHING TO DO
AROUND HERE.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.400
I'VE BEEN SITTING
INSIDE ALL DAY.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.033
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO FOR FUN?

00:21.033 --> 00:23.500
HAVE TEA WITH YOUR SISTER.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.200
I MADE RED ZINGER.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.400
YEAH, ZING THIS.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.500
SOMEBODY NEEDS A NAP.

00:31.233 --> 00:34.100
MY LIFE BITES--

00:34.100 --> 00:35.934
BORING, PREDICTABLE,

00:35.934 --> 00:37.967
NEVER A SURPRISE.

00:39.133 --> 00:41.200
DON'T TURN ON
THE LIGHTS.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.600
SHAWN?

00:43.600 --> 00:45.133
THE COPS
ARE AFTER ME,

00:45.133 --> 00:46.700
MAYBE EVEN THE FBI.

00:46.700 --> 00:47.934
YOU'RE NOT INVOLVED,

00:47.934 --> 00:49.934
UNLESS
YOU WANT TO BE.

00:49.934 --> 00:53.233
[THUNDER]

00:53.233 --> 00:54.300
I'M IN!

01:57.834 --> 01:59.133
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY
I'M HERE.

01:59.133 --> 02:00.734
RIGHT, RIGHT.

02:00.734 --> 02:02.734
HOW'D YOU
GET IN HERE, ANYWAY?

02:02.734 --> 02:05.467
I CLIMBED UP THE TREE
INTO YOUR WINDOW.

02:05.467 --> 02:07.300
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO SEE ME.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.400
CORY, I'M A FUGITIVE.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.800
FUGITIVE? COOL!
GIVE ME DETAILS.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.967
OK.

02:14.967 --> 02:16.900
YOU REMEMBER
THAT CHERRY BOMB?

02:16.900 --> 02:17.900
OH, NO.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.734
FEENY FOUND IT.
YOU'RE SUSPENDED!

02:19.734 --> 02:22.600
NOTHING GOOD
EVER HAPPENS TO ME.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.934
ALL DAY I KEPT FEELING IT
IN MY POCKET,

02:24.934 --> 02:27.667
ALL ROUND AND WAXY,
JUST BEGGING ME TO LIGHT IT.

02:27.667 --> 02:29.834
I MEAN, I COULD ACTUALLY
HEAR IT SAYING,

02:29.834 --> 02:31.667
"LIGHT ME.
LIGHT ME, SHAWN.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.400
BLOW SOMETHING UP."

02:33.400 --> 02:34.500
WELL, WHAT DID YOU
BLOW UP?

02:34.500 --> 02:37.300
WELL, I WAS RIDING MY BIKE
DOWN "K" STREET--

02:37.300 --> 02:39.133
YOU BLEW UP "K" STREET?

02:39.133 --> 02:41.000
I PARK
AT THE MARKET GIANT--

02:41.000 --> 02:43.734
YOU BLEW UP
THE MARKET GIANT?

02:43.734 --> 02:45.033
THAT'S MY DAD'S STORE.

02:45.033 --> 02:47.300
I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.734
BUT THERE ON THE GROUND
BY THE SHOPPING CARTS--

02:49.734 --> 02:51.100
A MATCHBOOK.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.667
IT WAS LIKE A SIGN, YOU
KNOW, SAYING, "NOW, SHAWN.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.834
NOW.
LET THE SUCKER BLOW."

02:55.834 --> 02:57.400
SO YOU'RE HOLDING
THE LIT CHERRY BOMB--

02:57.400 --> 02:58.567
I DON'T REMEMBER
LIGHTING IT.

02:58.567 --> 02:59.900
BUT SUDDENLY THERE
IT WAS IN MY HAND,

02:59.900 --> 03:01.500
SPARKS
FLYING OFF THE FUSE,

03:01.500 --> 03:04.100
AND SUDDENLY,
I REALIZED,

03:04.100 --> 03:05.367
THIS THING'S
GOING TO GO OFF.

03:05.367 --> 03:07.700
I MEAN, I COULD LOSE
AN EYE, LOSE AN ARM,

03:07.700 --> 03:11.300
WIND UP LOOKING LIKE
OUR SHOP TEACHER.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.767
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST THROW IT?

03:13.767 --> 03:15.734
THERE WERE PEOPLE ALL AROUND.
I COULD'VE HURT SOMEBODY.

03:15.734 --> 03:19.133
I JUST KNEW I HAD TO GET IT
FAR, FAR AWAY,

03:19.133 --> 03:21.300
SO I MAILED IT.

03:21.300 --> 03:24.500
YOU BLEW UP
A UNITED STATES MAILBOX?

03:24.500 --> 03:25.967
WELL, IT'S STILL STANDING,

03:25.967 --> 03:28.400
ALTHOUGH THE SIDES
DID PUFF OUT

03:28.400 --> 03:30.500
LIKE A FAT GUY BURPING.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.000
ALL THE STUFF INSIDE
GOT TORCHED THOUGH.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.233
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE FLAMES

03:35.233 --> 03:38.967
AND THE FREAKED-OUT LOOK
ON PEOPLE'S FACES.

03:38.967 --> 03:40.400
WHY AM I NEVER AROUND

03:40.400 --> 03:42.100
WHEN THE GREAT STUFF
HAPPENS?

03:42.100 --> 03:44.200
I THINK I SHOOK THE COPS.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.800
WHAT DO I DO NOW?
I CAN'T GO HOME.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.867
WHY NOT? IT WASN'T LIKE
YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE.

03:49.867 --> 03:51.300
BUT I DID IT.

03:51.300 --> 03:54.400
THAT'S THE ONLY PART
MY OLD MAN'S GOING TO HEAR.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.767
I STEPPED OVER THE LINE
THIS TIME, CORY.

03:55.767 --> 03:58.200
I'M GOING TO GET
KILLED FOR THIS.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.600
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

03:59.600 --> 04:02.000
YOU THINK I COULD STAY
HERE FOR A COUPLE DAYS,

04:02.000 --> 04:03.500
JUST UNTIL
I FIGURE THINGS OUT?

04:03.500 --> 04:05.600
FINE WITH ME.
I'LL GO ASK MY MOM.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.734
YOU'RE REALLY NEW
AT THIS, AREN'T YOU?

04:08.734 --> 04:10.200
WHAT?

04:10.200 --> 04:11.300
NO ONE CAN KNOW
I'M HERE,

04:11.300 --> 04:12.834
ESPECIALLY
NOT YOUR FOLKS.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.467
THEY'LL TELL
MY MOM AND DAD.

04:14.467 --> 04:17.300
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
WHAT ABOUT ERIC?

04:17.300 --> 04:19.100
HE'S DUMB, BUT
I THINK HE'LL NOTICE

04:19.100 --> 04:21.000
A THIRD GUY IN THE ROOM.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I'LL HIDE IN THE CLOSET.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.800
HAVE YOU SEEN MY CLOSET?

04:28.233 --> 04:30.400
OK, UNDER THE BED.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.100
OK, BUT YOU MAY NOT BE

04:32.100 --> 04:35.200
THE ONLY LIVING THING
UNDER THERE.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.934
HI. HOW ARE YOU DOING?

04:37.934 --> 04:40.400
JEEZ, HOW DO YOU
LIVE LIKE THIS?

04:40.400 --> 04:42.100
<i>Mother: CORY, DINNER!</i>

04:42.100 --> 04:44.100
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?
CAN I STAY?

04:44.100 --> 04:45.767
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

04:45.767 --> 04:48.300
NOW GET OUT OF THAT WET STUFF
AND PUT ON SOME OF MY CLOTHES.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.667
I'LL SNEAK UP SOME FOOD.

04:49.667 --> 04:50.967
REMEMBER,
I'M YOUR ACCOMPLICE.

04:50.967 --> 04:52.967
I'M ACCOMPLICE BOY.

04:54.734 --> 04:55.767
THANKS A LOT, MAN.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.400
NO, THANK YOU.
IT'S ABOUT TIME

04:57.400 --> 04:59.767
THERE'S A LITTLE
EXCITEMENT AROUND HERE.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.900
LISTEN. LISTEN, COR.
YOU'RE GOING DOWNSTAIRS

05:02.900 --> 05:04.400
TO KEEP SOMETHING
FROM YOUR PARENTS,

05:04.400 --> 05:06.200
AND IF IT WAS ME,
I WOULDN'T WORRY,

05:06.200 --> 05:09.033
BUT I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE GOING TO ACT WEIRD.

05:09.033 --> 05:10.367
ATTEMPT TO STAY COOL, HUH?

05:10.367 --> 05:15.200
COOL? ME? HA!
THEY WON'T NOTICE A THING.

05:28.767 --> 05:31.233
DAD AND MOM,
I HAVE SO MUCH HOMEWORK.

05:31.233 --> 05:33.200
I'M GOING TO EAT IN MY ROOM,
AND I NEED FUEL.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.300
I NEED LOTS OF FUEL.
I NEED ENOUGH FUEL FOR TWO,

05:35.300 --> 05:36.400
ALTHOUGH THERE'S
ONLY ONE OF ME,

05:36.400 --> 05:37.834
WHICH IS SO INTERESTING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

05:39.867 --> 05:42.367
CORY, YOU'RE GROUNDED
FOR 2 WEEKS.

05:42.367 --> 05:43.767
WHAT DID I DO?
I DON'T KNOW,

05:43.767 --> 05:44.867
BUT THE WAY YOU'RE BEHAVING,

05:44.867 --> 05:46.834
IT'S GOT TO BE
AT LEAST 2 WEEKS.

05:46.834 --> 05:50.367
DAD, I CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU
<i>I </i>HAVEN'T DONE A THING.

05:50.367 --> 05:51.600
[THUMP]

05:51.600 --> 05:52.667
WHAT WAS THAT?

05:52.667 --> 05:55.834
MY HOMEWORK
FELL OFF MY DESK.

05:55.834 --> 05:57.934
THERE'S SO DARN
MUCH OF IT.

05:57.934 --> 05:59.800
HA HA HA.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.000
OK.

06:03.934 --> 06:07.300
WHAT ARE YOU,
BOWLING UP HERE?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.667
SHAWN?

06:13.233 --> 06:15.900
I GUESS MY PANTS ARE
A LITTLE SHORT ON YOU.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.000
NO, NO, NO,
THEY FIT GREAT.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
ANYONE EVER TELL YOU
YOU'RE BUILT LIKE A CHIMP?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.900
DID ANYBODY
EVER TELL YOU

06:23.900 --> 06:26.734
DON'T INSULT THE BOY
WITH THE FOOD?

06:26.734 --> 06:30.033
NO KETCHUP? I ALWAYS HAVE
KETCHUP ON MY MEAT LOAF.

06:30.033 --> 06:31.934
OH, YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.000
I'M GOING TO GO
DOWNSTAIRS RIGHT NOW

06:34.000 --> 06:35.367
AND TELL MY MOM
THAT SHAWN,

06:35.367 --> 06:37.200
THE CHERRY BOMB
MAILBOX KILLER,

06:37.200 --> 06:39.600
WOULD LIKE A LITTLE KETCHUP
ON HIS MEAT LOAF.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.367
FINE, FINE. I'LL EAT
THIS DRY MEAT BRICK.

06:42.367 --> 06:43.967
<i>Eric:</i>
<i>OH, CORY!</i>

THINK YOU'RE PRETTY
SMOOTH, DON'T YOU?

06:50.200 --> 06:51.600
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.200
YOU DO?

06:53.200 --> 06:55.500
UH-HUH. SMUGGLING FOOD,
STRANGE NOISES,

06:55.500 --> 06:57.200
THE SMELL IN HERE.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.233
SMELL?

06:58.233 --> 07:00.100
YEAH, I TRIED
THE SAME THING ONCE.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.467
YOU'RE HIDING A PUPPY, HUH?
WHERE IS HE?

07:02.467 --> 07:05.467
COME HERE, PUPPY.
WHERE'S THE CUTE LITTLE BOY?

07:07.200 --> 07:10.600
OH, IT'S A BIG PUPPY.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.700
OK, ERIC,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.133
I'M HIDING A PUPPY,

07:14.133 --> 07:16.000
BUT I LET IT GO.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.500
WHEN?

07:17.500 --> 07:18.700
UH, JUST A MINUTE AGO.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.800
YOU LET THE PUPPY GO?

07:20.800 --> 07:21.867
UH-HUH.

07:21.867 --> 07:24.000
OUT A SECOND STORY WINDOW?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.367
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

07:26.367 --> 07:28.100
HEY, GUYS.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.000
MOM, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.500
IT'S TIME
FOR MORGAN'S BATH,

07:31.500 --> 07:33.767
AND HER DOOR TO
THE BATHROOM IS LOCKED.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.600
WAIT A MINUTE. LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.934
[SHOUTING] YOU'RE GOING
INTO THE BATHROOM

07:37.934 --> 07:39.867
TO GIVE MORGAN A BATH?

07:39.867 --> 07:42.767
NOTHING GETS PAST YOU.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.600
HEY, COR?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.400
LASSIE CAME HOME.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.700
I CAN EXPLAIN
WHAT HE'S DOING.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.200
NO, NO, NO. LOOK,
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.300
I MEAN,
IF I KNOW THE TRUTH,

07:56.300 --> 07:57.700
I ONLY HAVE TO LIE
WHEN QUESTIONED.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.867
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU TWO.

07:59.867 --> 08:01.500
LET'S JUST CUT
TO MY BRIBE, SHALL WE?

08:04.367 --> 08:06.300
DRY BRICK OF MEAT?

08:06.300 --> 08:07.834
YEAH, THAT'S TEMPTING,

08:07.834 --> 08:09.600
BUT I WAS THINKING,
OH, I DON'T KNOW,

08:09.600 --> 08:12.400
YOU TWO TAKE OVER ALL
MY HOUSEHOLD CHORES?

08:12.400 --> 08:13.834
IN THE BIZARRO WORLD.

08:13.834 --> 08:16.100

YOU KNOW, DAD,
AN INTERESTING THING.

08:25.233 --> 08:26.233
SEE, WE WERE JUST--

08:26.233 --> 08:28.400
OH, NO! MY TURN, RIGHT?

08:28.400 --> 08:30.500
OH. HEY, THANKS.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.600
I THINK SHAWN
WAS MAKING

08:34.600 --> 08:36.567
A DARING
POLITICAL STATEMENT.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.000
AND WHAT STATEMENT WAS THAT,

08:38.000 --> 08:39.767
BUILD MORE PRISONS?

08:39.767 --> 08:42.500
YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.033
SORRY I'M LATE.

LITTLE STUNT YESTERDAY.

08:48.567 --> 08:50.200
I JUST SPOKE
WITH HIS PARENTS.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.934
EVIDENTLY, SHAWN DIDN'T
COME HOME LAST NIGHT.

08:52.934 --> 08:57.200
I IMAGINE NO ONE HERE
HAS HEARD FROM HIM.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.767
ME?

08:58.767 --> 09:00.600
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I HEARD FROM SHAWN?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.500

THE ENTIRE CLASS.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.000
YEAH, BUT YOU MAKE IT
SOUND LIKE

09:04.000 --> 09:06.500
I LIT THE CHERRY BOMB
AND STUCK IT IN THE MAILBOX

09:06.500 --> 09:08.600

09:13.734 --> 09:16.500
HE CLAIMS HE HASN'T
SPOKEN WITH SHAWN

09:17.767 --> 09:19.800
YET HE KNOWS
THE PRECISE LOCATION,

10:05.400 --> 10:07.600

10:12.300 --> 10:15.200
MR. MATTHEWS?
ANYTHING WRONG?

10:22.867 --> 10:25.967

10:25.967 --> 10:27.400

10:36.400 --> 10:38.000
I CHECKED OUTSIDE
THE STORE.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.300
I DIDN'T SEE IT
ANYWHERE.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.767
SEE WHAT?

10:40.767 --> 10:42.667
UH, IT.

10:42.667 --> 10:44.033
IT?

10:44.033 --> 10:46.233
IT-- ITALY.

10:46.233 --> 10:50.300
I DIDN'T SEE ITALY.
I DIDN'T SEE FRANCE.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.033
I DIDN'T SEE
ANYBODY'S UNDERPANTS.

10:53.033 --> 10:55.567
WELL, CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY.
I JUST DID THE LAUNDRY.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.600
AND WHILE I WAS
PUTTING IT AWAY,

10:57.600 --> 10:59.900
I DISCOVERED
A LITTLE SOMETHING

10:59.900 --> 11:01.000
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.700
[HEARTBEAT]
WHAT?

11:04.700 --> 11:07.567
YOU ORGANIZED
YOUR CLOSET.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.567
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

11:10.567 --> 11:12.567
PRACTICALLY
CLEANED ITSELF.

11:12.567 --> 11:15.300
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GIVE ME A HUG

11:15.300 --> 11:16.734
AND MOVE ALONG?

11:16.734 --> 11:21.200
OK. I'LL JUST
LEAVE YOU HERE

11:21.200 --> 11:24.800
ALL BY YOURSELF.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.200
BYE.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.834
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS,

11:29.834 --> 11:31.734
I ALMOST BLOW OFF MY HAND

11:31.734 --> 11:34.500
AND GET SUCKED
INTO A HOOVER.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.200
YOU ORGANIZED MY CLOSET?

11:36.200 --> 11:37.800
YEAH, WELL,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.767
JUST WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
TO DO IN THIS ROOM ALL DAY?

11:40.767 --> 11:41.967
LET ME TELL YOU,
YOU HAVE

11:41.967 --> 11:43.834
A VERY UP-TO-DATE
COLLECTION OF VIDEO GAMES.

11:43.834 --> 11:46.500
I ESPECIALLY ENJOYED PONG.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.600
FEENY SAID YOUR PARENTS
CAME BY SCHOOL.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.734
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
DID YOU?

11:51.734 --> 11:53.467
WELL, HE WAS WORKING ME,
ALL RIGHT,

11:53.467 --> 11:55.767
BUT I WAS A STONE.

11:55.767 --> 11:57.100
<i>Father:</i>
<i>CORY.</i>

11:57.100 --> 11:59.000
YEAH! I'M ALONE! HIDE.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.400
I FEAR FOR MY LIFE.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.600
HEY. HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

12:04.600 --> 12:08.467
QUIT PUMPING ME!
I KNOW NOTHING!

12:08.467 --> 12:11.667
WELL, ME--
I HAD A LOUSY DAY.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.900
YOU SEE, YESTERDAY
I PUT ABOUT, OH...

12:13.900 --> 12:18.000
26 BILLS IN THE MAILBOX
OUTSIDE MY STORE, AND...

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
TODAY I FOUND OUT THAT, UH--

12:21.000 --> 12:23.100
WELL, YOU KNOW THE REST.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.400
YEAH, I HEARD SOMETHING
ALONG THE LINES

12:25.400 --> 12:27.033
OF A MAILBOX
NATURAL DISASTER.

12:27.033 --> 12:29.100
YOU KNOW, THE GLUE
ON THOSE STAMPS

12:29.100 --> 12:31.300
IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.900
I HEARD THAT SHAWN
MAY BE INVOLVED

12:33.900 --> 12:36.200
TO THE EXTENT THAT, UM,

12:36.200 --> 12:37.934
HE DID IT.

12:37.934 --> 12:40.200
HUH. NOW THAT
I DID NOT HEAR.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.734
<i>Shawn:</i>
<i>AH-CHOO!</i>

12:45.767 --> 12:48.000
BLESS YOU.
THANK YOU.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.200
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,

12:49.200 --> 12:50.233
THERE WAS A KID
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD

12:50.233 --> 12:51.367
WHO WAS
A LOT LIKE SHAWN--

12:51.367 --> 12:53.233
ALWAYS GETTING
INTO TROUBLE.

12:53.233 --> 12:54.800
YOU KNOW,
SMALL THINGS AT FIRST--

12:54.800 --> 12:55.967
SHOPLIFTING CANDY,

12:55.967 --> 12:57.667
LETTING AIR
OUT OF TIRES...

12:57.667 --> 13:00.066
BUT PRETTY SOON,
HE GOT KIND OF BORED,

13:00.066 --> 13:04.100
MOVED ON TO MORE SERIOUS STUFF,
MORE DANGEROUS.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.400
DAD, SHAWN'S
NOT LIKE THAT.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.967
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK HE IS.

13:07.967 --> 13:09.300
IF HE WERE HERE NOW,

13:09.300 --> 13:11.834
I'D COME DOWN ON HIM
VERY HARD.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.500
<i>Shawn:</i>
<i>UH!</i>

13:14.500 --> 13:16.233
UH, THAT MEAT LOAF.

13:18.767 --> 13:22.400
BECAUSE WHAT SHAWN DID
WAS IRRESPONSIBLE AND DUMB.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.033
HOW COME YOU'RE
TELLING ME THIS?

13:24.033 --> 13:25.300
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW

13:25.300 --> 13:28.000
THAT IF YOU EVER
DO ANYTHING WRONG,

13:28.000 --> 13:29.500
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME HOME.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.100
I DON'T CARE
HOW BAD IT IS,

13:31.100 --> 13:34.767
IT CAN NEVER BE AS BAD
AS NOT COMING HOME.

13:34.767 --> 13:36.467
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME, DAD.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.934
I'M A COME-HOMER.

13:37.934 --> 13:41.033
FINE, BECAUSE I DON'T CARE
HOW TIGHT A SPOT YOU'RE IN...

13:41.033 --> 13:42.100
<i>Shawn:</i>
<i>OOH!</i>

13:44.000 --> 13:45.967
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

13:45.967 --> 13:47.000
DEAL?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.500
DEAL.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.767
OH, MAN.

13:55.767 --> 13:58.133
YOUR DAD REALLY HURT ME.

13:58.133 --> 13:59.467
THAT STUFF HE SAID?

13:59.467 --> 14:02.400
NO. HE SAT ON MY HEAD.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.900
YOU KNOW, SHAWN,
I BET IF WE EXPLAINED

14:04.900 --> 14:06.000
TO MY DAD
HOW THIS HAPPENED,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.100
HE COULD TALK TO YOUR DAD,
AND THEN--

14:08.100 --> 14:10.900
NO WAY. I CAN'T EVER
GO HOME, CORY.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.200
DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT
MY DAD WAS SAYING?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.834
NOT ALL OF IT.

14:14.834 --> 14:17.367
I BLACKED OUT
A COUPLE TIMES.

14:17.367 --> 14:18.467
ALL I'M SAYING IS,

14:18.467 --> 14:20.567
I THINK THAT IF BOTH
OUR DADS WORKED TOGETHER

14:20.567 --> 14:21.700
AND TALKED IT OVER

14:21.700 --> 14:23.567
AND MY DAD EXPLAINED
TO YOUR DAD

14:23.567 --> 14:24.667
THAT YOU'RE
STILL AN OK KID--

14:24.667 --> 14:26.233
IT WON'T WORK, COR.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.667
WHY NOT?

14:27.667 --> 14:30.400
BECAUSE MY DAD WILL KILL
YOUR DAD JUST TO GET TO ME.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.500
SHAWN, YOU'RE
OVERREACTING.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.834
CORY, ALL OUR LIVES WE'VE
DONE THESE LITTLE THINGS,

14:35.834 --> 14:38.834
BUT WE'VE ALWAYS STAYED
ON THIS SIDE OF THE LINE.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.567
WHAT LINE?

14:40.567 --> 14:43.000
THE LINE THAT SEPARATES
THE LITTLE BAD

14:43.000 --> 14:44.467
FROM THE BIG BAD--

14:44.467 --> 14:46.767
THE LINE I BLOW UP
WITH MY CHERRY BOMB.

14:46.767 --> 14:48.600
SHAWN, YOU'RE WRONG.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.100
WATCH.
I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.200
DAD?

14:52.200 --> 14:54.300
DAD, CAN YOU COME
HERE A SECOND?

14:54.300 --> 14:56.767
NO! CORY!

14:56.767 --> 14:58.834
DAD? ALL RIGHT,
MY DAD'S COMING.

14:58.834 --> 15:01.200
HE'LL FIX EVERYTHING.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.600
SHAWN?

15:03.600 --> 15:06.000
SHAWN!

15:06.000 --> 15:07.700
HEY, HUNTER!

15:07.700 --> 15:08.600
SHAWN!

15:14.233 --> 15:15.567
OK, HE'S GONE.

15:15.567 --> 15:17.200
YOU THINK
HE'S GOING HOME?

15:17.200 --> 15:19.500
I THINK EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OK.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.000
KNOW WHY?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.300
WHY?

15:22.300 --> 15:23.900
WELL, BECAUSE THAT TALK

15:23.900 --> 15:25.100
YOU GAVE ME UP IN MY ROOM--

15:25.100 --> 15:26.600
WELL, YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT,

15:26.600 --> 15:28.934
BUT SHAWN HEARD
THE WHOLE THING.

15:28.934 --> 15:31.000
REALLY?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.700
YEAH, HE WAS
UNDER MY BED.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.900
UNDER YOUR BED?

15:34.900 --> 15:38.000
NOT THE ONE I SAT ON?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.567
ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN
HIDING SHAWN UP THERE

15:41.567 --> 15:42.800
SINCE YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON.

15:44.934 --> 15:46.467
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?

15:46.467 --> 15:49.133
SINCE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

15:49.133 --> 15:51.100
THE NOISES COMING
FROM YOUR ROOM.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.300
THE FOOD YOU SNUCK UPSTAIRS.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.667
IT COULD'VE BEEN A PUPPY.

15:54.667 --> 15:58.700
CORY, NO ONE IS THAT NAIVE.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.567
UH, I HAPPEN TO LIKE
THE PUPPY THEORY.

16:05.100 --> 16:08.200
MR. FEENY SAW SHAWN
SNEAK IN YESTERDAY,

16:08.200 --> 16:10.033
AND HE PHONED US
TO LET US KNOW.

16:10.033 --> 16:11.300
IT'S A CONSPIRACY,

16:11.300 --> 16:13.300
AN INTERNATIONAL
ADULTS' HOT LINE.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.367
ANY KID ANYWHERE
MAKES A MOVE--

16:15.367 --> 16:17.767
THE PHONES ARE RINGING.

16:17.767 --> 16:21.000
WAIT. YOU GUYS DIDN'T TELL
SHAWN'S PARENTS, DID YOU?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.767
OF COURSE WE DID.

16:22.767 --> 16:24.000
CORY, DIDN'T YOU THINK

16:24.000 --> 16:25.500
HOW SCARED SHAWN'S
PARENTS WOULD BE

16:25.500 --> 16:28.300
NOT KNOWING WHERE
THEIR SON WAS?

16:28.300 --> 16:29.900
WAIT, I DON'T GET IT.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.667
IF YOU GUYS KNEW ALL ALONG,
WHY DIDN'T YOU BUST US?

16:32.667 --> 16:34.300
SURE WOULD'VE
BEEN EASIER ON ME.

16:34.300 --> 16:36.767
IT WAS KILLING ME
TRYING TO HIDE THIS FROM YOU.

16:36.767 --> 16:38.367
WELL, WE KNEW
HE WAS SAFE HERE

16:38.367 --> 16:39.700
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND,

16:39.700 --> 16:41.300
WHO WE HOPED WOULD HELP HIM
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION

16:41.300 --> 16:42.400
AND GO HOME.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.200
COR, I KNOW YOU
REALLY LIKE SHAWN.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.000
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN
YOUR BEST BUD

16:47.000 --> 16:48.033
SINCE HE TAUGHT YOU

16:48.033 --> 16:50.000
HOW TO PICK THE LOCK
ON YOUR PLAYPEN,

16:50.000 --> 16:51.767
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING

16:51.767 --> 16:53.467
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW
ABOUT HIM.

16:53.467 --> 16:55.300
YOU THINK
HE'S A CRIMINAL.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.900
I THINK HE HAS
ROUGH EDGES.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.567
I THINK HE'S AT
A POINT IN HIS LIFE

16:59.567 --> 17:02.367
WHERE HE CAN GO
ONE OF TWO WAYS.

17:02.367 --> 17:03.834
BACK ON MY SIDE
OF THE LINE

17:03.834 --> 17:08.233
OR GONE FOREVER
INTO CHERRY BOMB LAND.

17:08.233 --> 17:11.200
CORY, SHAWN HAS ALWAYS
REMINDED YOUR DAD

17:11.200 --> 17:13.767
OF SOMEONE HE KNEW
WHEN HE WAS A KID.

17:13.767 --> 17:16.233
YOU HAD A BEST FRIEND
LIKE SHAWN?

17:16.233 --> 17:18.100
UH-UH. I WAS LIKE SHAWN.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.300
I HAD A BEST FRIEND
LIKE YOU.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.033
YOU DID?
MM-HMM.

17:22.033 --> 17:24.133
AND WHEN I WAS
ABOUT 12 YEARS OLD,

17:24.133 --> 17:25.300
I GOT INTO TROUBLE ONCE,

17:25.300 --> 17:27.834
AND I CONSIDERED
MY OPTIONS--

17:27.834 --> 17:30.467
I COULD HOP A TRAIN
TO CALIFORNIA.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.033
I COULD START
MY LIFE AT 13,

17:32.033 --> 17:34.967
GET A JOB AT 14,
BE MARRIED AT 15,

17:34.967 --> 17:35.967
HAVE KIDS AT 16.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.400
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A GREAT IDEA.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.100
SOUNDS LIKE
A DUMB IDEA TO ME.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.567
OH, YOU THINK SO, HUH?

17:42.567 --> 17:45.600
YEAH. JUST BECAUSE YOU MAKE
ONE LITTLE MISTAKE,

17:45.600 --> 17:47.867
YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW
YOUR WHOLE LIFE AWAY.

17:47.867 --> 17:51.400
YOU SEE, GUYS LIKE YOU
AND MY BEST FRIEND RICHIE--

17:51.400 --> 17:52.900
THAT'S THE WAY YOU THINK.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.734
GUYS LIKE ME AND SHAWN--
WE DON'T THINK LIKE THAT.

17:55.734 --> 17:57.400
DID YOU EVER GO
TO CALIFORNIA?

17:57.400 --> 17:59.700
NO.
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

17:59.700 --> 18:02.400
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMEHOW I ENDED UP HERE

18:02.400 --> 18:05.500
IN A ROOM WITH YOU.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.667
LISTEN, SHAWN'S GOING
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.200
WHAT SHOULD I DO
WHEN HE DOES?

18:10.200 --> 18:12.600
A KID LIKE YOU--

18:12.600 --> 18:14.000
YOU'LL KNOW.

18:27.300 --> 18:28.767
WELL, I GUESS
THE ROOM IS EMPTY.

18:28.767 --> 18:33.900
WHAT A PERFECT TIME
TO SET FIRE TO MY DESK.

18:35.967 --> 18:39.300
WHAT, CORY TOLD YOU
I WAS HERE?

18:39.300 --> 18:41.300
DID HE RAT ON ME?

18:41.300 --> 18:42.800
ON THE CONTRARY,

18:42.800 --> 18:45.300
MR. MATTHEWS HAS BEEN
A TRUE AND LOYAL ALLY.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.667
IF ANYBODY HAS BETRAYED
THIS FRIENDSHIP,

18:47.667 --> 18:50.700
IT WAS YOU THE MOMENT
YOU ASKED HIM TO LIE.

18:50.700 --> 18:54.600
I WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME FOR HIM.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.600
MR. FEENY, ABOUT THE ONLY
THING I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT

18:57.600 --> 19:00.400
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW
IS CORY AND MY FRIENDSHIP.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.300
OH, HERE WE GO. I KNEW
IT WAS HERE SOMEWHERE.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.467
IN MY EAGERNESS TO DEPART
FOR THE WEEKEND,

19:05.467 --> 19:07.000
I FORGOT TO TAKE IT HOME.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.734
WHAT IS IT?

19:08.734 --> 19:12.033
CANVAS. I OFTEN PAINT
ON THE WEEKENDS.

19:12.033 --> 19:14.700
VERY STRONG MATERIAL.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.700
DIFFICULT TO RIP.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.467
GIVE IT A TRY.

19:18.467 --> 19:20.367

20:23.900 --> 20:25.700

CORY, OR--

20:51.000 --> 20:53.367
OR ELSE WHAT,

20:53.367 --> 20:56.467
FINE. GO AHEAD.
WIPE THE FLOOR WITH ME.

20:56.467 --> 20:58.200
CORY, JUST GET
OUT OF MY WAY.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.567

HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

21:19.100 --> 21:20.767
JUST GO HOME.

MY PARENTS ARE GOING
TO GROUND ME FOR,
LIKE, A YEAR.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.400
WELL, THEN,
I'LL SEE YOU IN A YEAR.

21:30.900 --> 21:33.100

TO ADJUST TO THE LIGHT THOUGH.

22:10.300 --> 22:11.500
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

22:11.500 --> 22:14.033
