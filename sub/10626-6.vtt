WEBVTT

00:02.215 --> 00:04.306
It is. So you heard about Steve?

00:04.346 --> 00:06.890
- He's requested a transfer.
- She's gorgeous.

00:06.902 --> 00:09.797
- What have you possibly got to complain about?
- I'm not sure.

00:09.827 --> 00:12.125
- That's the problem.
- Do I kill people?

00:12.180 --> 00:14.367
- Do you?
- What does my police record say?

00:14.410 --> 00:17.924
It's clean. Spotless.
Almost artificially so.

00:17.949 --> 00:19.759
My colleagues were telling
me about this mad woman,

00:19.760 --> 00:21.566
she jumped out in front of a car.

00:21.570 --> 00:23.670
It's a miracle they didn't
kill her, so they say.

00:23.689 --> 00:25.415
Harry!

00:25.445 --> 00:26.723
Is he dead?

00:28.942 --> 00:31.878
- Do you trust me now?
- I might be getting there.

00:33.635 --> 00:36.020
The man who killed her
children, what did she do to him?

00:36.069 --> 00:38.293
She nailed him to a
tree and slit his throat.

00:38.343 --> 00:40.954
Woe betide anyone who
crosses Isabella Augustine.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.477 --> 00:51.878
What do you call this?

00:53.739 --> 00:55.785
A way to get your attention.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.285
Torturing people?

00:58.636 --> 01:00.400
That's the wrong way, Eve.

01:00.405 --> 01:01.923
You needed to know.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.583
Not from you,

01:04.927 --> 01:06.795
not like this.

01:10.027 --> 01:11.704
I can handle Isabella.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.541
She's my problem.

01:13.578 --> 01:16.454
That's because she's made herself
your problem. That's what she does.

01:18.341 --> 01:21.339
She's a wildcat, Harry. Play
with her, you'll get bitten.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.071
Well, then.

01:23.329 --> 01:25.019
I'll have to bite back.

01:29.739 --> 01:32.180
Intercept the localiser
runway two eight right.

01:32.181 --> 01:34.530
Cleared ILS two eight right.

01:38.273 --> 01:39.476
Right, ladies and gentlemen,

01:39.482 --> 01:41.196
the seatbelt sign's now
has been switched off.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.918
So, if you'd like to
start gathering your things

01:42.924 --> 01:44.391
we'll have you disembarked in a jiffy.

01:44.397 --> 01:47.300
- OK, final honeymoon video.
- Yay! We made it home.

01:47.306 --> 01:49.839
Hi, guys. We're just back from
honeymoon. Had an amazing time...

01:55.681 --> 01:56.881
Oh, here we go.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.558
Good evening... argh!

02:06.000 --> 02:07.430
- What the...
- Oh, fuck!

03:24.922 --> 03:29.277
Well, well, well, if it isn't MIS's
very own welterweight champion.

03:29.283 --> 03:31.389
Please go on joking
about my anger issues.

03:31.395 --> 03:33.601
- I'm gonna get suspended.
- What?

03:33.829 --> 03:35.826
Winter gave me an official warning.

03:35.881 --> 03:39.377
If Cartmell's solicitor
presses assault charges,

03:39.420 --> 03:41.305
DPS will have no choice.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.480
I shouldn't have let this happen.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.877
I lost control. And I
don't do that! I don't.

03:46.932 --> 03:49.267
Hey, I still have to have my debrief.

03:49.273 --> 03:51.423
I'll talk to the DPS,
smooth things over.

03:51.429 --> 03:53.030
Ah, there'll be no talking
and smoothing of things.

03:53.036 --> 03:55.515
I'm going to keep my head down
and stay far away from trouble.

03:55.527 --> 03:58.444
I pray for a world where
that's possible, DS Chohan.

03:58.450 --> 04:00.481
Unfortunately, you're needed.

04:00.505 --> 04:04.751
Flight E307 from Oslo landed
just under four hours ago.

04:07.823 --> 04:09.315
Jesus Christ!

04:09.874 --> 04:11.938
We're still assessing the scene.

04:12.516 --> 04:14.753
Apparently, bullet
wipes around the wounds

04:14.765 --> 04:18.224
indicate the shooter
used a silenced pistol.

04:18.752 --> 04:20.305
Is this a terrorist attack?

04:20.827 --> 04:22.524
Doesn't seem likely.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.315
Not messy or loud enough, and
so far no one's claimed it.

04:26.327 --> 04:28.706
Wait a minute. "He"? This
was the work of one person?

04:28.729 --> 04:31.023
Yep. Got him right here.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.777
- He was dressed as ground crew.
- What's in the bag, I wonder?

04:36.092 --> 04:39.133
Well, the passengers' hand
luggage has all been gone through.

04:39.171 --> 04:41.944
He acted alone and
killed without hesitation.

04:42.141 --> 04:43.770
So who was he?

04:45.415 --> 04:47.110
What'd he take?

04:48.907 --> 04:51.155
A Norwegian import agent was on board

04:51.167 --> 04:53.875
carrying wonds worth 30,000 euros.

04:53.881 --> 04:55.217
And the backpack?

04:56.144 --> 04:57.840
It doesn't feel right.

04:59.413 --> 05:01.041
Would you break into an airport,

05:01.047 --> 05:03.520
kill nine people for
30,000 euros in change?

05:03.526 --> 05:04.762
Well, no.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.401
So you think he was after
something we don't know about.

05:07.419 --> 05:09.606
_

05:09.624 --> 05:11.265
_

05:11.332 --> 05:13.231
- What about their phones?
- All gone.

05:14.128 --> 05:16.862
- Why would he take them?
- Camera phones.

05:16.982 --> 05:18.490
Didn't want to be seen.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.788
Are we sure they're all...

05:21.812 --> 05:24.592
You hear that? It was a phone, right?

05:29.987 --> 05:31.320
Yeah.

05:45.575 --> 05:46.856
Got you.

05:47.384 --> 05:48.584
_

05:50.353 --> 05:53.040
Come on, Dai! Chop chop.
We wanna get a move on

05:53.040 --> 05:54.662
if we're going to be on time for this...

05:54.908 --> 05:56.265
I see.

05:56.271 --> 05:58.876
- No, Mum, no, Mum...
- Ah-ah-ah, what did I tell you?

05:59.009 --> 06:01.384
Anything you watch in
this house I get to watch.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.476
Right, what is this?

06:05.611 --> 06:08.124
It's real. Dad has superpowers.

06:08.793 --> 06:10.459
Nobody's that lucky.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.382
Look, watch it.

06:13.144 --> 06:14.821
Dais, this is just...

06:14.941 --> 06:17.469
- digitally manipulated nonsense.
- No, it's Dad.

06:17.493 --> 06:20.327
Thrown together by some
basement-dwelling computer geek

06:20.339 --> 06:22.698
- desperate for hits.
- He can do things. He's told me he can.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.714
Because Dad's going
through a mid-life crisis.

06:25.762 --> 06:28.926
- And imagining he's somehow special helps.
- He knew you'd be like this.

06:28.951 --> 06:30.389
- Daisy...
- OK, fine.

06:30.893 --> 06:32.355
You don't have to believe it,

06:32.475 --> 06:34.270
but he puts himself in danger every day

06:34.278 --> 06:35.686
and this is what helps him, Mum.

06:36.394 --> 06:38.760
He used to have us,
and now he's got this.

06:46.113 --> 06:48.654
Aargh! Ugh!

06:48.660 --> 06:50.134
Let me see, let me see.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.555
They don't tell you
that when you hit someone

06:52.575 --> 06:54.920
it hurts you as much
as the person you hit.

06:54.926 --> 06:56.739
Hmmm. Oh, Jesus.

06:56.859 --> 06:58.567
I wouldn't count on that.

06:59.309 --> 07:00.360
OK.

07:01.931 --> 07:03.400
Let me ask you something.

07:05.110 --> 07:06.344
Why are you here?

07:06.580 --> 07:07.543
Hm?

07:07.883 --> 07:09.126
Why are you

07:09.387 --> 07:10.950
in the police force?

07:12.027 --> 07:14.446
I suppose I wanted to make a difference.

07:14.765 --> 07:17.365
If you want to make a
difference, join the Girl Guides.

07:18.019 --> 07:20.359
We just saw nine dead bodies laid out.

07:20.536 --> 07:21.839
Why are you really here?

07:21.907 --> 07:24.729
- Because the world is a shitty place.
- Right,

07:24.753 --> 07:26.346
and how does that make you feel?

07:26.508 --> 07:27.904
- Angry.
- Exactly.

07:28.223 --> 07:31.104
We're all angry. Me, you,
Winter. Especially Winter.

07:31.139 --> 07:32.933
That's why we're police.

07:33.552 --> 07:35.621
You have to let it out. You do.

07:35.741 --> 07:38.044
The secret is to know when.

07:38.315 --> 07:40.072
Draw a line. Anyone steps over it,

07:40.078 --> 07:41.642
you give 'em a good
kick in the bollocks.

07:41.677 --> 07:43.457
And that'll stop me getting suspended?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.680
No.

07:44.914 --> 07:46.573
But it'll make you feel a lot better.

07:46.693 --> 07:48.780
Fine. When do I give you yours?

07:48.824 --> 07:51.076
- What, you owe me one, do you?
- Five, I'd say.

07:51.110 --> 07:52.477
At least five.

07:52.516 --> 07:55.263
Oh, listen, um, I need to take this.

07:57.579 --> 07:59.854
- Isabella, hi.
- Hello, stranger.

08:00.036 --> 08:01.663
You've been hard to reach.

08:02.498 --> 08:05.000
Work. Busy. You know how it is.

08:05.010 --> 08:06.892
I haven't heard from you in days.

08:06.898 --> 08:09.494
Besides, I seem to
remember saving your life,

08:09.500 --> 08:12.048
which in my book means
you owe me dinner at Nobu.

08:14.938 --> 08:16.127
Harry?

08:17.056 --> 08:18.751
Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

08:26.862 --> 08:28.971
Jurgen Bloch, 47.

08:29.035 --> 08:30.755
South African national.

08:31.160 --> 08:35.326
Started out in private military
companies in the Congo and Angola,

08:35.446 --> 08:37.883
then progressed to personal contracts.

08:38.664 --> 08:40.316
Interpol has a file on him

08:40.322 --> 08:43.720
that reads like a Tom
Clancy's Big Book of Ideas.

08:44.056 --> 08:45.452
Hong Kong.

08:45.702 --> 08:46.828
Prague.

08:47.050 --> 08:48.874
Mexico City.

08:49.143 --> 08:52.960
All high-profile, high-casualty hits.

08:53.080 --> 08:56.633
Eight years ago he was linked to
a car bombing on the Amalfi coast.

08:56.849 --> 08:58.555
Then the trail went cold.

08:58.717 --> 09:00.839
Bloch's been a ghost
up until three days ago,

09:00.845 --> 09:04.177
When Dutch police photographed
him at Schiphol Airport.

09:05.275 --> 09:07.345
So Flight E307 was a hit.

09:07.828 --> 09:11.179
But why kill everybody on board
if you've got a specific target?

09:11.185 --> 09:12.384
Well...

09:13.549 --> 09:16.124
nothing like a bit of
chaos to keep us busy.

09:16.130 --> 09:18.437
We've got our hands
full with nine bodies.

09:18.443 --> 09:20.822
We don't see that Bloch
had a particular target,

09:20.828 --> 09:22.696
but why does he go to all that effort

09:22.941 --> 09:24.666
to keep that target hidden?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.754
Because he has a second
target connected to the first.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.704
Exactly. He's planning another hit.

09:30.099 --> 09:31.215
Soon.

09:32.297 --> 09:33.738
Get on to Pathology.

09:33.744 --> 09:36.270
Tell them to look for any aberrations
in the victims' wound patterns.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.607
Anything that suggests a target.

09:38.676 --> 09:40.505
What was that mark on his neck?

09:45.464 --> 09:47.824
- Tattoo?
- No.

09:51.911 --> 09:53.465
That's not a tattoo.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.375
That's a scar.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.829
Tell me more about how
Isabella's children died.

10:06.835 --> 10:09.509
- Can't it wait? I'm going to dinner.
- I brought dinner.

10:09.629 --> 10:12.030
You're staying and you're talking.

10:16.907 --> 10:20.160
- They're somewhere in Italy.
- Yeah, Salerno on the Amalfi coast.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.257
Eight years ago, local
Mafia took a contract out

10:22.263 --> 10:23.605
on a judge who picked a fight.

10:23.725 --> 10:27.515
- Are you telling me or am I telling you?
- I'm sorry, but detail is important.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.685
The hit man obviously had
a taste for the dramatic

10:32.691 --> 10:35.183
'cause he put too much plastique
under Mr. Judge's motor,

10:35.188 --> 10:36.479
took out two cars either side of him

10:36.485 --> 10:38.813
and Isabella Augustine's
perfect life is over.

10:39.609 --> 10:41.122
But she didn't let it lie.

10:41.463 --> 10:43.308
She went after him
with everything she had,

10:43.332 --> 10:44.908
caught up with him in Morocco.

10:45.028 --> 10:46.864
Ran him off the road just outside Rabat.

10:46.874 --> 10:48.538
OK, and what did she do, Eve?

10:48.544 --> 10:50.845
She nailed him to a tree
by the palms of his hands,

10:50.851 --> 10:53.343
cut his throat and
left him there to die.

10:53.998 --> 10:55.336
And the killer's name?

10:55.342 --> 10:57.858
What was the killer's name Eve?

10:59.556 --> 11:00.917
It's Bloch.

11:01.764 --> 11:03.024
Jurgen Bloch.

11:05.884 --> 11:07.112
Take a look.

11:08.011 --> 11:09.831
See there? And there.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.160
His hands, those aren't stigmata.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.726
He survived.

11:14.291 --> 11:17.402
He's alive. And he's
in London right now.

11:20.493 --> 11:21.699
Bacon?

11:22.813 --> 11:24.215
I smell bacon.

11:24.509 --> 11:27.129
Thought that would
rise the savage beast.

11:27.135 --> 11:28.395
- Yeah.
- Here.

11:29.581 --> 11:31.031
You're a beautiful man. You know that?

11:31.037 --> 11:32.800
Ah, don't thank me...

11:32.806 --> 11:34.362
we've got company.

11:36.474 --> 11:39.327
They did not have strawberries, but...

11:39.766 --> 11:41.028
they had bagels.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.095
Rich?

11:43.478 --> 11:47.540
Um, yeah. I should
probably get some... jam.

11:48.211 --> 11:49.913
From the, um,

11:50.001 --> 11:51.501
jam shop.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.088
What are you doing?

11:57.489 --> 12:00.831
Well... I brought you breakfast.

12:01.337 --> 12:03.867
How close are we, Isabella?

12:04.492 --> 12:06.409
We spend all this time together.

12:08.814 --> 12:10.453
We have this connection.

12:11.421 --> 12:13.279
How well do I really know you?

12:15.042 --> 12:16.369
What do you want to know?

12:26.635 --> 12:28.950
People are dying every day in this city,

12:29.588 --> 12:31.144
always by accident.

12:31.715 --> 12:33.374
She is always there.

12:33.767 --> 12:34.924
How many?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.580
- I don't know.
- Eve...

12:37.887 --> 12:40.752
- She wants them dead and they die.
- Jesus.

12:41.602 --> 12:43.919
You can't seriously
think that means anything.

12:43.924 --> 12:46.604
I think it means you've been
murdering innocent people.

12:47.115 --> 12:48.438
Were you going to tell me?

12:48.444 --> 12:51.508
Your pain, your anger, just
letting it out like that.

12:51.514 --> 12:53.759
- Is that how you do it?
- I...

12:54.196 --> 12:55.825
don't do anything.

12:56.316 --> 12:58.350
Some people just get
the luck they deserve.

12:59.297 --> 13:01.596
I think it might be best if I...

13:01.973 --> 13:03.888
leave London for a while.

13:03.894 --> 13:06.366
- Oh.
- Yeah, get some time alone.

13:06.486 --> 13:10.636
Me with my anger and,
oh, you in your work.

13:10.642 --> 13:12.636
What? You're just going to walk away?

13:14.227 --> 13:15.409
Look...

13:19.232 --> 13:21.261
- What's this?
- Nothing.

13:23.368 --> 13:24.764
You know who this is?

13:25.772 --> 13:27.654
Jurgen Bloch...

13:29.177 --> 13:30.476
Gutted me.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.976
I was just trying to find
out what happened to you.

13:33.554 --> 13:34.926
When was this taken?

13:35.564 --> 13:36.863
I don't know.

13:38.562 --> 13:40.003
He's still alive.

13:43.662 --> 13:45.027
I'm, ah, going.

13:48.588 --> 13:51.106
We have something so good, Harry.

13:52.129 --> 13:54.745
You decide whether you
want to throw it away.

14:03.616 --> 14:05.650
Passengers were fish in a barrel.

14:05.859 --> 14:08.842
Bloch fired at them
indiscriminately. Quick kills.

14:09.366 --> 14:11.550
But there was one victim
he took his time with.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.831
Elliot Aimes was his target.

14:14.269 --> 14:16.438
See? One in the leg to floor him.

14:19.342 --> 14:21.059
Then he moves in close.

14:21.516 --> 14:25.092
Note the micro abrasions
around the second bullet wound.

14:28.230 --> 14:29.825
The end of the barrel.

14:30.722 --> 14:32.098
An execution.

14:40.098 --> 14:41.980
Elliot Aimes was a post-graduate

14:41.981 --> 14:44.265
art restoration student
at The Courtauld.

14:44.658 --> 14:46.999
He took a year out to go
travelling in the Far East

14:47.005 --> 14:48.909
on the bank of Mum and Dad.

14:48.915 --> 14:52.626
The suspicious thing is that he
spent a whole month coming home.

14:52.943 --> 14:55.345
Backwater routes, private charters.

14:55.598 --> 14:57.118
Like he didn't want to be noticed.

14:57.294 --> 14:58.633
There's something else.

14:58.906 --> 15:01.090
He boarded with a carry-on in Oslo

15:01.096 --> 15:03.099
and no sign of it at Docklands Airport.

15:03.434 --> 15:04.635
Right.

15:06.362 --> 15:09.257
So Bloch kills him, takes his backpack.

15:09.330 --> 15:10.468
Right.

15:10.497 --> 15:12.038
And I'm thinking drugs.

15:12.791 --> 15:14.056
Yeah, maybe.

15:15.133 --> 15:17.786
Anyone in London we can talk
to about Elliot and drugs?

15:17.792 --> 15:19.455
He has a girlfriend, Hannah Okoye.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.002
She runs a gallery on
Grove Street, Shoreditch.

15:22.015 --> 15:25.130
Good place to start. Up for
a bit of culture, Orwell?

15:25.975 --> 15:27.946
- A bit of what?
- Come on.

15:38.732 --> 15:40.006
Like it?

15:42.175 --> 15:45.418
It's pretty full of itself, but
I suppose it does have a certain...

15:45.627 --> 15:48.353
neo-Dadaist humour to
it. What do you think?

15:49.747 --> 15:52.042
Right, yeah. Good.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.441
Private view's tonight.

15:54.447 --> 15:57.038
- Invitation only.
- Hannah Okoye?

15:57.787 --> 15:59.134
DI Harry Clayton.

15:59.607 --> 16:03.082
We were hoping to have a word
with you about Elliot Aimes.

16:03.303 --> 16:06.271
Then you've got the wrong
person. I'm not with him any more.

16:06.404 --> 16:10.079
I'm afraid we have to tell you he
was murdered last night, Hannah.

16:16.363 --> 16:17.806
Jesus!

16:18.974 --> 16:20.633
Silly sod.

16:21.541 --> 16:23.512
Silly, silly sod.

16:28.915 --> 16:31.052
You went travelling
with him, didn't you?

16:31.086 --> 16:32.282
For a bit.

16:32.402 --> 16:33.664
While it was fun.

16:34.802 --> 16:38.041
Elliot was very good at
spending his parents' money.

16:38.263 --> 16:40.858
About five months in, they
cut off their credit card.

16:41.150 --> 16:42.517
We were in Macao.

16:42.929 --> 16:44.690
I thought, shit,

16:45.076 --> 16:46.676
that's it. Home time.

16:46.682 --> 16:50.438
- But Elliot had made some friends.
- Who?

16:50.482 --> 16:53.562
Anders and Livia. Backpackers.

16:53.899 --> 16:57.087
Bottom feeders living off
crumbs from the jet set crowd.

16:57.802 --> 17:00.823
They convinced Elliot they
could find him some work,

17:00.943 --> 17:05.250
so he got happy and stupid
and started shagging,

17:05.281 --> 17:07.098
probably both of them.

17:07.555 --> 17:08.882
And I came home.

17:09.002 --> 17:11.842
Anders Sorrenson and Livia Warren.

17:12.736 --> 17:14.303
I'll do a background.

17:15.699 --> 17:19.240
Hannah, do you know if, um,
Elliot was involved in drugs?

17:20.011 --> 17:22.080
I haven't spoken to him in months.

17:22.425 --> 17:25.627
Whatever he got up to out there
was down to him and his friends.

17:26.021 --> 17:30.171
Well, I officially love how easy
social media makes police work.

17:30.362 --> 17:33.493
OK, so Anders Sorrenson
is a Swedish national.

17:33.613 --> 17:35.208
Livia Warren's a Londoner.

17:35.214 --> 17:37.760
They both studied at
Central Saint Martins,

17:37.930 --> 17:40.411
and they both travel extensively.

17:40.699 --> 17:42.887
Where in the world are they right now?

17:42.893 --> 17:44.565
London, surprisingly.

17:44.571 --> 17:48.422
According to Customs, they both took
different routes back from Macao.

17:48.428 --> 17:50.193
They both arrived yesterday.

17:50.488 --> 17:52.567
If they're a couple why are
they travelling separately?

17:52.573 --> 17:53.579
Yeah.

17:53.585 --> 17:56.152
It may be easier to remain unnoticed.

17:56.602 --> 17:59.267
- They might be Bloch's next targets.
- Could be.

17:59.273 --> 18:02.527
So Warren has a studio
space in Shadwell,

18:02.533 --> 18:05.655
and Sorrenson's got a room
booked over in Hackney.

18:05.850 --> 18:09.484
See, look how useful DC
Orwell is, Suri, yeah?

18:09.490 --> 18:12.749
If everyone at MIS was that
informative and helpful...

18:12.755 --> 18:15.765
Yeah, I know what you're
doing. Still getting a transfer.

18:16.052 --> 18:17.252
Coin toss.

18:17.599 --> 18:18.645
Coin toss?

18:18.664 --> 18:20.518
It always leads me
to where I want to be.

18:20.637 --> 18:23.537
Heads, you and Suri take
Warren. Tails, Sorrenson.

18:29.786 --> 18:31.197
And away we go.

19:12.639 --> 19:13.839
Suri?

19:14.162 --> 19:15.735
Tell me good things.

19:15.769 --> 19:18.314
No good things to tell.
We're at Warren's place.

19:18.347 --> 19:20.071
Looks like someone got here first.

19:20.077 --> 19:21.931
Hard drive's gone from her computer.

19:22.235 --> 19:24.016
OK, so you need to get out of there.

19:24.045 --> 19:26.274
Bloch's been there, which
means he can come back

19:26.308 --> 19:28.049
which means you're dodging bullets.

19:28.127 --> 19:30.505
Right, yeah. Definitely not into that.

19:30.637 --> 19:31.980
- Sorrenson...
- What?

19:31.986 --> 19:33.489
He's here. I'll call you back.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.340
Anders Sorrenson?

19:47.373 --> 19:50.095
Aargh! Argh! Ugh!

19:50.101 --> 19:51.919
- Go! Go, go!
- Argh!

19:57.758 --> 19:58.799
Go!

19:59.256 --> 20:02.035
Aargh! No, please... !

20:08.262 --> 20:09.274
Go!

20:37.715 --> 20:38.950
Harry.

20:43.236 --> 20:44.793
I'm afraid he didn't make it.

20:45.265 --> 20:48.252
Bloch's bullet hit a
major artery in his leg.

20:52.265 --> 20:53.734
How many sugars are in it?

20:53.874 --> 20:55.179
At least four.

21:06.873 --> 21:09.490
Right, let's take a look at this stuff.

21:23.459 --> 21:25.436
Harry, what the hell are you doing?!

21:25.881 --> 21:27.445
That's evidence!

21:38.720 --> 21:40.004
What is that?

21:41.292 --> 21:42.634
I don't know.

21:44.460 --> 21:46.282
But I know a man who does.

21:48.268 --> 21:49.550
You're still in your jarmies?

21:49.556 --> 21:51.808
I'm still recovering
from this morning's drama.

21:51.913 --> 21:54.640
Action movie marathon,
best thing for it.

21:54.842 --> 21:58.837
Come, divest thyself
of those fine garments

21:58.843 --> 22:01.197
and join me in worship at
the church of John Wick.

22:01.203 --> 22:03.398
Little too close for comfort right now.

22:04.940 --> 22:06.409
What does that look like to you?

22:06.701 --> 22:08.617
Oh, well, on its own,

22:08.623 --> 22:10.314
I'd say about six million euros.

22:10.645 --> 22:12.027
- On its own?
- Yeah.

22:12.147 --> 22:13.510
It's a Francis Bacon sketch.

22:14.070 --> 22:17.110
Looks like prep work for Triptych 1973.

22:17.116 --> 22:19.761
It was a series of paintings he
did after his lover killed himself.

22:19.767 --> 22:23.254
All three sketches together would
be worth about 20, 30 million.

22:24.652 --> 22:26.106
- That's interesting...
- Mm.

22:26.215 --> 22:29.840
because this particular piece
is sat on my desk back in MIS.

22:29.846 --> 22:31.690
Jesus!

22:32.676 --> 22:34.692
That's one hell of a score.

22:35.190 --> 22:39.247
The world of the billionaire art
collector is a secret war zone.

22:39.498 --> 22:40.990
You get something stolen from you,

22:40.996 --> 22:42.406
you don't go through the authorities

22:42.412 --> 22:44.780
'cause that would make
you look weak, instead...

22:44.857 --> 22:48.099
- you set up a bounty.
- What? Our hitman?

22:48.105 --> 22:50.800
Maybe, if you're really pissed off.

22:50.806 --> 22:52.037
- Ah, here you go.
- Ai-ya.

22:52.043 --> 22:55.538
Three studies for
Triptych May-June 1973.

22:55.656 --> 22:59.311
- Stolen in Macao just over a month ago.
- From who?

22:59.317 --> 23:01.843
Well, it's unlikely we'll
ever be able to tell that.

23:02.168 --> 23:06.895
Well, this bounty notice was set
up by a shell of a shell of a shell.

23:06.901 --> 23:08.638
So all three were stolen?

23:08.854 --> 23:10.362
And given that you're...

23:10.640 --> 23:13.158
such an extremely
legitimate businessman,

23:13.164 --> 23:15.624
ah, you couldn't possibly have
any idea where these thieves

23:15.630 --> 23:17.564
might fence such desirable items?

23:17.570 --> 23:19.959
- No idea whatsoever.
- Uh-huh?

23:20.073 --> 23:22.907
But if you were to say the right name,

23:22.913 --> 23:26.284
it might trigger some
deeply repressed memory.

23:26.290 --> 23:27.545
Right.

23:28.557 --> 23:31.227
Suri, there are three sketches.

23:31.237 --> 23:33.150
Bloch must have taken
one from Aimes' backpack.

23:33.156 --> 23:36.002
- Are you eating popcorn?
- No.

23:36.238 --> 23:38.023
Livia Warren must have the third,

23:38.029 --> 23:39.847
so she'll be next on Bloch's list.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.624
Any luck on Sorrenson's phone?

23:41.630 --> 23:43.671
I'm looking for high-frequency hits,

23:43.677 --> 23:46.341
on names, regularly dialled
numbers over the last month.

23:46.347 --> 23:48.516
No go. His emails and
IMs have been scrubbed.

23:48.522 --> 23:49.899
We'll need more time to retrieve them.

23:49.905 --> 23:52.719
Ooh, try his appointments. Anything
in London over the next day or two?

23:53.102 --> 23:55.247
Ah, nope. Nothing.

23:56.220 --> 23:57.931
Wait. There's something here.

23:58.162 --> 24:00.351
On a book from Sorrenson's bag.

24:00.735 --> 24:03.775
"Stark, 1600." And then today's date.

24:03.932 --> 24:05.252
Andreas Stark.

24:05.258 --> 24:08.346
He's definitely the kind of
dealer who would buy stolen art.

24:08.352 --> 24:10.645
- He's in London now?
- In just a wee bit.

24:10.651 --> 24:12.981
He's opening a big new
gallery in Bermondsey.

24:12.987 --> 24:15.465
- It's called The Stark House.
- D'you hear that, Suri?

24:15.471 --> 24:17.077
We get to him before Bloch does.

24:17.083 --> 24:19.502
Get Winter to rally
the troops. Good man.

24:22.904 --> 24:24.804
- Hello there.
- I'm staying over.

24:24.810 --> 24:27.016
Me and Mum had an argument
about your superpowers.

24:27.022 --> 24:29.312
Oh. Right.

24:29.952 --> 24:32.906
Does Mum know about my... superpowers?

24:32.912 --> 24:35.458
Of course she does. I told her that
I'm extremely concerned about you.

24:35.464 --> 24:37.611
Brilliant. Um...

24:38.053 --> 24:40.787
Look, sweetheart. It's great

24:41.060 --> 24:44.061
that you're taking such
an interest in, um...

24:45.155 --> 24:49.587
ah, but, ah... I've got
to  go and... fight evil.

24:49.645 --> 24:52.739
Er, hey, Daisy. You're
not staying, are you?

24:52.745 --> 24:54.467
She's staying, I'm going.

24:54.864 --> 24:55.945
Here.

24:56.568 --> 24:57.663
Pizza money.

24:57.669 --> 24:59.562
Don't let him stay up too late.

25:04.225 --> 25:05.376
So,

25:06.088 --> 25:08.535
do you like the films of Keanu Reeves?

25:12.318 --> 25:16.031
We need to talk about
you torturing my staff.

25:17.610 --> 25:18.810
Ugh!

25:24.386 --> 25:25.491
Fine.

25:27.611 --> 25:28.926
Let's talk.

25:31.772 --> 25:33.043
Every time you throw one of these,

25:33.049 --> 25:36.194
it's a 50/50 chance
which way I need to dodge.

25:36.584 --> 25:38.072
Good odds.

25:44.497 --> 25:46.936
Good. Not perfect.

25:47.149 --> 25:49.233
Oof! Ugh!

25:50.321 --> 25:51.499
So...

25:52.817 --> 25:54.517
now you have a choice.

25:54.943 --> 25:56.519
We can continue

25:57.077 --> 26:00.291
or you can tell me what Harry
told you about Jurgen Bloch.

26:09.344 --> 26:10.838
You knew, didn't you?

26:11.148 --> 26:13.067
I know you don't mess
with John Wick's puppy.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.474
No, I meant about Dad

26:14.821 --> 26:16.674
- and the bracelet.
- Ah.

26:17.302 --> 26:19.336
That, yes.

26:19.563 --> 26:21.533
- 'Cause I've been thinking.
- Mm-hm?

26:21.617 --> 26:24.200
About how all superheroes
need a person to help them.

26:24.677 --> 26:26.169
Batman has Alfred,

26:26.175 --> 26:28.273
- Spider-Man has Aunt May.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:28.279 --> 26:29.808
I'm not your dad's Aunt May.

26:29.881 --> 26:31.652
No, but he does need someone.

26:32.703 --> 26:34.470
You know about old things.

26:34.872 --> 26:36.361
I like weird things.

26:36.608 --> 26:38.110
Maybe it should be us.

26:40.305 --> 26:41.602
Maybe it should.

26:42.422 --> 26:43.500
Yep.

26:44.420 --> 26:45.517
Hey!

26:45.523 --> 26:47.027
Leave some for me.

26:48.146 --> 26:49.400
Harry, we're moving.

26:49.406 --> 26:52.602
If Livia Warren's meeting Stark
at four. We're short on time.

26:53.464 --> 26:55.380
I'm minutes away, but
the traffic's heavy.

26:55.444 --> 26:58.052
We've gotta get there before Bloch
does, or she's in real trouble.

26:58.058 --> 26:59.265
Yeah, I got it.

27:03.231 --> 27:05.024
_

27:05.030 --> 27:06.236
Shit!

27:11.756 --> 27:13.959
I thought that might get your attention.

27:14.302 --> 27:15.803
Have you hurt Eve?

27:15.809 --> 27:17.412
She's a little scuffed around the edges,

27:17.418 --> 27:19.204
but now we're having a drink together.

27:19.895 --> 27:21.420
She has told me

27:21.426 --> 27:25.571
about our mutual friend being
in town and here's the deal.

27:26.306 --> 27:30.062
You step aside for 24
hours and let me handle him.

27:30.068 --> 27:32.157
I can't do that. You know I can't.

27:33.802 --> 27:36.725
I need you to think
carefully about this, Harry.

27:36.731 --> 27:39.280
We're approaching a
point of no return and

27:39.479 --> 27:42.996
if we don't start helping
each other, we might fall out.

27:43.084 --> 27:45.569
Isabella, listen to me.
I can do this for you.

27:45.575 --> 27:47.971
I can put Bloch away for the
rest of his shitty little life.

27:47.977 --> 27:51.580
I killed him eight years ago.
I shouldn't have to do it again.

27:51.586 --> 27:54.215
- You don't have to do it at all!
- But I will.

27:54.598 --> 27:57.152
He never deserved justice. Never.

27:58.790 --> 28:00.698
So, now you're going
to tell me where he is?

28:00.704 --> 28:01.904
It's never gonna happen.

28:01.910 --> 28:03.600
DS Chohan to DI Clayton.

28:03.606 --> 28:06.231
ETA five minutes to
Stark House, Bermondsey.

28:07.508 --> 28:09.414
Oh, bad luck.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.185
Isabella, that's got nothing to
do with Bloch. I'm telling you.

28:12.203 --> 28:15.764
For a man who loves to gamble,
you're a terrible liar, Harry.

28:16.085 --> 28:18.011
- I'll see you there.
- Isabella...

28:18.512 --> 28:19.874
What?!

28:44.182 --> 28:47.061
I'm DS Chohan. This is
my colleague DC Orwell.

28:47.181 --> 28:48.861
We're looking for Andreas Stark.

28:48.867 --> 28:50.387
Ah, he's in the White Room.

28:51.540 --> 28:53.272
It's, uh, through there.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.268
OK, you two cover the exits.

28:56.437 --> 28:57.944
He's not in trouble, is he?

29:12.634 --> 29:13.852
Mr Stark?

29:25.637 --> 29:26.876
Mr Stark?

29:27.494 --> 29:28.708
My co...

29:31.346 --> 29:32.554
Shit.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.755
Urgent medical assistance required.

29:34.830 --> 29:37.082
Adult male, believed Stark,

29:37.088 --> 29:38.464
fatally injured.

29:38.969 --> 29:40.459
Livia's backpack.

29:49.207 --> 29:51.141
Either you got here
too late or too early.

29:51.704 --> 29:53.266
I'm not sure which.

29:54.642 --> 29:56.383
- It's OK, Livia.
- Radios.

29:56.389 --> 29:58.377
Come on. Give me your radios.

30:01.962 --> 30:03.175
Come on.

30:05.069 --> 30:06.163
You.

30:06.860 --> 30:08.325
Pass me the bag, eh?

30:08.572 --> 30:10.532
The box in the bag. Pass it to me.

30:10.751 --> 30:12.140
Come on, do it!

30:18.681 --> 30:19.903
Take us.

30:20.321 --> 30:22.215
You're in control, OK?

30:22.282 --> 30:23.806
She's not important to you.

30:24.134 --> 30:26.204
You leave her, take us.

30:26.509 --> 30:27.761
Fair enough, bro.

30:28.129 --> 30:29.329
Ah!

30:29.335 --> 30:30.413
No!

30:31.149 --> 30:32.802
- Argh!
- Orwell?!

30:35.912 --> 30:38.794
Don't move! Don't you move.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.085
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to, sweetheart.

30:41.474 --> 30:42.739
Places to go.

30:42.913 --> 30:44.130
People to see, huh?

30:44.718 --> 30:46.530
So, you're going to have
to give me your best.

30:46.835 --> 30:48.635
You heard the man, Suri.

30:48.641 --> 30:50.829
Give him your best.

30:53.583 --> 30:55.723
I thought you didn't look the type.

30:57.216 --> 30:58.669
Argh! Oh!

30:59.193 --> 31:01.883
Shots fired! Repeat, shots fired!

31:01.889 --> 31:03.835
- Bloch is on the move!
- Steve?!

31:05.052 --> 31:06.678
Steve, are you OK?

31:14.910 --> 31:16.327
You should be dead.

31:18.838 --> 31:22.449
- Most people tell me that.
- I'm not most people.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.715
You remember me, don't you?

31:27.111 --> 31:29.139
I'm not sure I could forget you.

31:32.598 --> 31:34.723
Pulling those nails through my hands.

31:36.112 --> 31:38.058
Holding my throat closed.

31:38.707 --> 31:39.888
Hot.

31:40.114 --> 31:41.374
Sticky.

31:42.216 --> 31:44.426
Flies crawling inside me.

31:45.941 --> 31:48.504
- I walked miles like that.
- Good.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.981
So you remember why I did it?

31:51.418 --> 31:53.437
You see, that's the problem with my job.

31:54.277 --> 31:56.025
I make a lot of enemies.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.103
So you're going to have
to refresh my memory.

31:59.109 --> 32:00.325
Salerno.

32:00.844 --> 32:03.718
Two children caught in a car bomb blast.

32:04.936 --> 32:06.182
You killed them.

32:07.069 --> 32:09.486
My children, my loves.

32:09.994 --> 32:11.787
And I thought what I did
to you would be enough,

32:11.793 --> 32:13.494
but here we are again.

32:13.588 --> 32:16.011
So, what are you going
to do to me this time, eh?

32:17.369 --> 32:20.790
Why don't you point that
gun at me and find out?

32:21.689 --> 32:22.891
Pleasure.

32:29.005 --> 32:30.590
Bloch, no!

32:33.783 --> 32:34.983
Ugh!

32:44.896 --> 32:47.788
Welcome to the point of no return.

32:50.449 --> 32:51.578
Where's Bloch?

32:51.665 --> 32:54.081
Bloch's gone because you let him go.

32:55.860 --> 32:57.477
He was about to kill you.

32:57.483 --> 32:59.554
He was about to die.

32:59.949 --> 33:02.845
Now we're going to have
to start all over again.

33:03.452 --> 33:06.850
Or I call for our boys with the
big guns and have you arrested.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.839
For what exactly?

33:09.375 --> 33:12.533
It's not my fault if accidents
keep happening around me.

33:13.103 --> 33:14.827
See, Harry,

33:14.833 --> 33:16.960
you may be the law,

33:17.825 --> 33:19.368
but I'm above it.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.846
No one's above the law.

33:23.613 --> 33:25.228
I can't let you go.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.504
I might not be able to
prove what you've done,

33:30.394 --> 33:33.017
but I know what you are.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.727
That's a pity

33:37.222 --> 33:40.267
because I know exactly
where Bloch is going

33:40.519 --> 33:44.722
and I'm pretty sure you want
him almost as much as I do.

33:46.245 --> 33:47.910
Your choice, Harry.

33:48.551 --> 33:50.498
Bloch or me?

33:51.448 --> 33:54.053
You never know, you
might learn something.

33:55.698 --> 33:57.474
Clock's ticking.

34:01.370 --> 34:02.736
I'm driving.

34:17.436 --> 34:18.636
Argh!

34:22.998 --> 34:24.467
Ugghh!

34:36.342 --> 34:37.960
So what do you know that I don't?

34:37.966 --> 34:40.290
When it comes to Bloch, everything.

34:40.581 --> 34:42.708
After Salerno, I spent
months hunting him,

34:42.715 --> 34:45.873
so, I know he's on way too
many watch lists to travel.

34:46.091 --> 34:49.201
- So, smeone flew him in?
- No, he flew himself in.

34:49.279 --> 34:51.789
He has a plane, licensed under an alias.

34:51.795 --> 34:53.518
It's been stowed at Ripley Airfield,

34:53.524 --> 34:55.902
north of the city, for
the past three days.

34:56.078 --> 34:58.682
- There's no guarantee that's his exit.
- True.

34:58.945 --> 35:02.188
So, I paid an air traffic controller
an inordinate amount of money

35:02.194 --> 35:04.063
to keep an eye on his flight schedule.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.589
His has a departure
window in the next hour.

35:06.595 --> 35:08.891
60 minutes to the other
side of the M25? No chance.

35:08.897 --> 35:09.837
Really?

35:09.843 --> 35:11.953
All this time together
and it still amazes me

35:11.959 --> 35:13.544
how little you've learned.

35:24.195 --> 35:26.245
This isn't over. Not yet.

35:26.884 --> 35:29.314
We need a locator trace
marker out on Bloch,

35:29.320 --> 35:32.655
a visual ID sent out to every
major station and airport.

35:32.661 --> 35:35.135
- Sir, I shot him, sir.
- I know.

35:35.407 --> 35:37.195
Good work, DS Chohan.

35:37.314 --> 35:39.206
- And Steve got shot, too.
- Twice.

35:39.212 --> 35:41.625
Yup. Excellent work, too, DC Orwell.

35:41.631 --> 35:42.895
There should be second warnings,

35:42.901 --> 35:44.554
mandatory leave, and
three miles of paperwork.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.149
Well, there probably will
be. First, we finish this.

35:47.155 --> 35:48.654
Back to the station.

35:48.920 --> 35:50.959
Orwell, try not to get shot again.

35:50.965 --> 35:53.508
- Working on it, sir.
- And somebody find me Clayton!

36:01.164 --> 36:02.422
You're up.

36:05.390 --> 36:07.638
DI Harry Clayton. Got business
with one of your clients.

36:07.644 --> 36:08.844
Thank you, sir.

36:29.170 --> 36:30.408
Isabella...

36:31.483 --> 36:32.690
Listen to me.

36:33.775 --> 36:35.709
You don't have to kill this man.

36:36.236 --> 36:37.986
You don't. Bloch...

36:38.276 --> 36:39.872
- needs to answer for his actions...
- No.

36:39.878 --> 36:43.366
but that is my job. Please,
please, let me do it.

36:43.385 --> 36:46.361
No! You don't get to decide
what's enough for that man, Harry.

36:46.362 --> 36:47.462
You don't!

36:47.519 --> 36:49.583
Think about what he took from me.

36:50.646 --> 36:53.179
Their names were Aaron and Asa.

36:53.185 --> 36:55.959
And I am so sorry that
you have lived with this,

36:56.079 --> 36:58.402
I'm so sorry that this
is what you have become.

36:59.788 --> 37:01.479
But I can't let you do this.

37:05.085 --> 37:07.324
Don't you walk away, Harry!

37:08.336 --> 37:11.173
Don't you fucking walk away!

38:27.386 --> 38:28.586
Ugh!

38:28.690 --> 38:29.890
Oof!

38:29.896 --> 38:31.096
Argh!

38:31.230 --> 38:32.430
Ugh!

38:39.631 --> 38:40.831
Ugh...

38:40.837 --> 38:42.037
argh!

38:44.302 --> 38:46.576
Oh, oh, oh.

38:46.582 --> 38:48.313
Bad luck.

38:49.468 --> 38:54.700
What is it about men that makes
them so intent on screwing things up?

38:55.542 --> 38:57.792
I'm not sure I'm the man to ask.

38:59.354 --> 39:01.409
If you don't mind, I
have a plane to catch, eh?

39:01.678 --> 39:03.393
Actually, she's talking to me.

39:03.751 --> 39:05.843
See, we're having a bit of a row.

39:06.062 --> 39:08.397
And you somehow ended
up in the middle of it.

39:08.403 --> 39:09.782
So here's the thing.

39:09.951 --> 39:11.198
You can fight with her,

39:11.204 --> 39:14.552
that'll probably end when
she drops a helicopter on you,

39:15.360 --> 39:16.689
or you can come with me.

39:16.695 --> 39:18.492
You can't stop this, Harry.

39:18.792 --> 39:21.749
You two, you are both
completely insane, eh?

39:21.755 --> 39:23.603
Me a little less than her,

39:23.886 --> 39:25.786
but that's your fault, mostly.

39:25.792 --> 39:29.434
36 hours ago, I stood looking at
nine dead people that you shot.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.041
Nine people!

39:31.047 --> 39:33.565
And all because a billionaire
wanted three drawings back

39:33.571 --> 39:35.222
he's probably never looked at!

39:35.416 --> 39:37.066
What can I tell you, bro?

39:38.123 --> 39:39.541
This world is grim.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.250
This is the way it made me.

39:43.131 --> 39:46.169
You and me both.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.156
Go on.

39:48.629 --> 39:49.887
Go on, do it.

39:50.650 --> 39:51.869
Do it.

39:52.222 --> 39:54.266
- Do it!
- Isabella, don't!

39:54.550 --> 39:57.113
Please! I am begging you!

39:59.339 --> 40:01.357
I'm not a murderer, Harry.

40:01.542 --> 40:04.970
He'll get what he deserves even
if I don't pull the trigger.

40:05.041 --> 40:06.803
So, don't do it!

40:08.479 --> 40:09.748
Fine.

40:10.549 --> 40:11.802
Fine.

40:14.244 --> 40:15.845
We'll do it your way.

40:18.813 --> 40:19.985
No!

40:27.816 --> 40:29.161
Shit!

40:33.432 --> 40:36.511
Argh! Argh! Aaaargh!

41:25.434 --> 41:27.958
My radio was smashed at Stark House.

41:28.536 --> 41:29.952
I got to my car,

41:30.419 --> 41:32.575
I followed Bloch to Ripley Airfield.

41:34.044 --> 41:36.957
Do I wanna know how
you managed to do that?

41:39.753 --> 41:40.974
No, Alistair.

41:41.940 --> 41:43.282
I don't think you do.

41:47.339 --> 41:49.692
I intercepted him before
he could reach the plane,

41:50.773 --> 41:51.980
we struggled

41:51.986 --> 41:53.206
and then...

41:55.187 --> 41:57.113
Then the bad thing...

41:58.379 --> 41:59.580
happened.

42:01.047 --> 42:02.250
Yeah.

42:03.157 --> 42:04.579
The bad thing.

42:06.165 --> 42:07.804
So it was an accident?

42:08.423 --> 42:09.652
That's all.

42:13.446 --> 42:15.264
Because I've noticed, Harry,

42:17.043 --> 42:18.965
a lot of them seem to happen around you,

42:18.971 --> 42:21.333
so if there's anything
that you want to tell me,

42:23.721 --> 42:25.515
now would be the time.

42:26.604 --> 42:27.838
No, sir.

42:31.112 --> 42:33.244
S'pose I just need a change of luck.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.823
There they are.

42:48.445 --> 42:50.049
Bonnie and Clyde.

42:51.847 --> 42:53.492
I've got a present for you.

42:59.672 --> 43:01.780
My first official warning.

43:01.786 --> 43:03.078
You framed it.

43:03.084 --> 43:05.116
- You shouldn't have.
- These are for you.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.486
Ha! Jelly babies.

43:09.492 --> 43:11.812
- My favourite. How did you know?
- I know.

43:12.163 --> 43:14.458
- Well, thank you.
- Thank you.

43:14.562 --> 43:16.083
For looking after my partner.

43:16.089 --> 43:19.003
- That was pretty brilliant.
- Yeah, yeah, kind of was.

43:22.262 --> 43:23.631
I'm still getting a transfer.

43:23.637 --> 43:25.083
- Yeah.
- We know.

43:33.465 --> 43:34.782
I got bitten.

43:35.285 --> 43:36.485
We both did.

43:40.567 --> 43:41.845
When we were young,

43:42.304 --> 43:44.748
neither of us had much,
didn't want much either.

43:45.320 --> 43:48.437
And back then she seemed
so... good and kind.

43:48.929 --> 43:50.148
I thought

43:50.718 --> 43:53.226
if I gave her the bracelet, she would do

43:53.312 --> 43:55.630
good and kind things with it.

43:57.180 --> 43:58.536
It was my mistake.

43:58.821 --> 44:01.223
So, you gave me my bracelet to...

44:02.110 --> 44:03.391
clean it up?

44:03.602 --> 44:05.311
I thought you two might find each other.

44:05.318 --> 44:07.225
I didn't know what would happen next.

44:07.938 --> 44:09.206
I do.

44:10.032 --> 44:12.220
I've seen what she's capable of,

44:12.825 --> 44:14.225
but I can't prove it.

44:16.040 --> 44:18.337
So, what am I supposed to do with her?

44:20.686 --> 44:22.128
End the game.

44:33.690 --> 44:36.209
- Lily-Anne Lau. -
Business or pleasure?

44:37.368 --> 44:40.201
One dead body belonging to... ?

44:40.213 --> 44:42.858
Dean Adams, 47, property developer.

44:42.866 --> 44:45.478
We have so many
clients, don't we, Harry?

44:45.484 --> 44:46.895
She's put someone in amongst us and now

44:46.901 --> 44:48.812
we've all ended up fighting each other!

44:49.707 --> 44:54.246
If you are lucky, the caretaker
might find you in time.

44:54.252 --> 44:56.666
I think one of our officers is bent.

44:57.581 --> 44:59.876
The guilty will be punished, Harry.
