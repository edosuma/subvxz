00:00.125 --> 00:03.043
Previously on Bates Motel...

00:03.111 --> 00:04.945
Do you remember anything?

00:05.013 --> 00:07.481
I've never seen anyone
go into a hole like that.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.766
I mean, you were, like, not there.

00:09.797 --> 00:12.052
Your mom warned me not to
talk about your blackouts.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.121
You told her something
happens to me when I black out.

00:14.189 --> 00:16.155
You said I change, that I'm not myself.

00:16.258 --> 00:18.993
Who am I, mother? Who
am I and what do I do?

00:19.094 --> 00:20.194
Here I am. Talk.

00:20.295 --> 00:21.328
Zane Morgan.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.463
What about him?

00:22.564 --> 00:23.697
You can take him out.

00:23.765 --> 00:25.566
Dylan, Nick Ford has Norman.

00:25.667 --> 00:28.269
He kidnapped him. He
won't tell me where he is.

00:28.370 --> 00:31.038
You need to convince Dylan
to do what I want him to do.

00:31.139 --> 00:34.441
If you tell your friend
Sheriff Romero or anyone else,

00:34.509 --> 00:36.043
Norman will be dead.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.612
I couldn't get to him.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.581
I'm really sorry to hear that.

00:50.292 --> 00:52.593
Help me, please.

00:52.694 --> 00:54.461
Help me.

00:54.562 --> 00:56.497
Help me, please. Help me.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.266
Help me, please.

00:59.334 --> 01:00.634
Help me.

01:00.702 --> 01:03.437
Help me, please. Help me.

01:27.495 --> 01:29.763
Nick Ford's dead. I just killed him.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.701
He's got Norman, but I don't know where.

01:34.769 --> 01:36.636
Get in the car.

01:56.691 --> 01:58.892
- Stay out here.
- We've gotta find Norman.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.093
You're following instructions here.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.027
You're doing what I tell you.

02:01.128 --> 02:04.164
- Is that clear?
- Yeah, it's clear.

03:02.023 --> 03:03.957
No respect for the dead, eh?

03:04.025 --> 03:05.158
No, no. Stay down.

03:05.259 --> 03:07.928
Hands up. Up.

03:16.225 --> 03:17.637
You're Nick's security guy, aren't you?

03:17.739 --> 03:18.705
What's your name?

03:18.806 --> 03:20.674
- Ben.
- Ben.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.975
You want to help yourself?

03:22.076 --> 03:23.110
Tell me where Norman Bates is.

03:23.177 --> 03:24.711
I don't know a Norman Bates.

03:26.013 --> 03:28.048
Don't do that shit, Ben.
Come on, man. It's over.

03:28.116 --> 03:29.483
All of this is over.

03:29.550 --> 03:31.251
You get that, right?

03:31.352 --> 03:33.253
I know you do 'cause you're
looting your boss's safe.

03:33.354 --> 03:37.457
So don't piss me off and
force me to shoot you.

03:37.558 --> 03:41.561
Where's Norman Bates?

04:13.761 --> 04:15.562
Norman!

04:16.831 --> 04:18.964
Norman!

04:21.135 --> 04:23.236
Norman!

04:24.672 --> 04:27.240
Norman!

04:30.711 --> 04:32.612
Norman!

04:34.682 --> 04:36.049
They must know Nick Ford got killed.

04:36.150 --> 04:36.983
They've all cleared out.

04:37.051 --> 04:39.152
Norman!

04:45.126 --> 04:47.160
Norman!

04:48.329 --> 04:51.031
Norman!

04:51.132 --> 04:53.433
Dylan!

04:59.073 --> 05:01.608
Dylan!

05:03.711 --> 05:05.078
Dylan!

05:05.179 --> 05:06.046
Norman, where are you?

05:06.147 --> 05:10.283
Dylan!

05:13.788 --> 05:16.256
Dylan!

05:16.357 --> 05:19.159
Back up, back up, back up.

05:27.068 --> 05:28.068
- We got you.
- You're really here?

05:28.169 --> 05:30.604
Yeah, it's really us.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.072
- You're really here?
- Yes, of course.

05:32.173 --> 05:34.207
It's us.

05:36.177 --> 05:38.011
You're okay, son.

05:41.182 --> 05:44.117
You're all right. We got you out.

05:52.827 --> 05:54.895
Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go.

05:54.996 --> 05:57.664
Let's go.

06:16.346 --> 06:17.584
Excuse me.

06:17.652 --> 06:19.086
My son is in the E.R. Norman Bates?

06:19.187 --> 06:22.022
- Oh, he's through that door.
- Thank you.

06:35.503 --> 06:38.405
I think he's gonna be okay.

06:38.473 --> 06:41.642
How'd they find him?

06:41.709 --> 06:44.978
We did. I was with Romero.

06:45.046 --> 06:47.748
You found him?

06:47.849 --> 06:49.916
Yeah.

06:58.693 --> 07:02.429
I love you, Dylan. I love you so much.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.770
I'm gonna go find the
doctor so he can talk to you.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.013
Norman?

07:20.081 --> 07:24.317
Norman? Sweetie?

07:25.720 --> 07:28.055
Can you hear me?

07:28.156 --> 07:31.258
Can you hear me?

07:36.130 --> 07:38.498
I'm so sorry you had to go through this.

07:38.599 --> 07:41.435
I'm so sorry.

07:44.872 --> 07:46.373
I have to...

07:46.441 --> 07:48.542
I have to tell you something.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.981
It was Ms. Watson's father who had me...

07:55.083 --> 07:58.452
In the box, in the ground.

07:58.553 --> 07:59.920
I had these dreams.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.955
No.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.423
Norman, don't talk about it now.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.058
- Memories...
- No.

08:06.728 --> 08:07.894
Can't you tell me about the dreams later?

08:07.995 --> 08:11.064
They're just dreams.

08:13.067 --> 08:15.569
I want you to put it out of your head.

08:15.636 --> 08:18.038
It's all over.

08:18.106 --> 08:20.207
All over.

08:43.297 --> 08:44.931
- What happened?
- Is Norman okay?

08:45.032 --> 08:46.533
He just had the stomach flu.

08:46.601 --> 08:48.135
It got so bad we had
to take him to the E.R.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.536
But he'll be better now.

08:49.604 --> 08:51.104
When did he get the stomach flu?

08:51.205 --> 08:52.739
I thought yesterday you couldn't find him.

08:52.840 --> 08:53.907
Well, I found him.

08:54.008 --> 08:55.475
And then he got the stomach flu.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.512
I'm gonna bring him to bed.

09:02.216 --> 09:04.217
Okay.

09:04.318 --> 09:05.952
Emma's quitting.

09:06.053 --> 09:07.754
Why?

09:07.855 --> 09:09.256
'Cause she said she felt left out

09:09.323 --> 09:10.657
all the time because we never tell her

09:10.758 --> 09:12.125
what's going on with our lives.

09:12.226 --> 09:14.861
I mean, she's not wrong,
but what could I say?

09:14.962 --> 09:15.996
"Norman's been kidnapped

09:16.063 --> 09:17.130
"but I can't really tell you

09:17.231 --> 09:19.533
because then they'll kill him"?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.135
It's sad, but there's
nothing I can do about it.

09:22.236 --> 09:26.506
It sucks. I'm gonna miss her.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.975
Come on, we're almost up these damn steps.

09:32.713 --> 09:35.315
I'm gonna run to the market
and get stuff for dinner.

09:35.416 --> 09:38.885
I'll make you a pot roast.
You need to get strong.

09:38.986 --> 09:40.120
I'm not really hungry.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.721
Yeah, well, you need to eat.

09:41.823 --> 09:45.325
Can I get you something else?

09:48.229 --> 09:53.466
Please rest and get better.

09:53.534 --> 09:55.635
I don't know what I would've done

09:55.736 --> 09:57.971
if anything happened to you.

09:58.072 --> 10:01.274
I honestly don't know.

10:26.934 --> 10:28.802
Christine.

10:28.903 --> 10:30.570
Christine?

10:30.671 --> 10:32.706
Christine, I'm so sorry.

10:32.807 --> 10:34.474
George just caught me at a bad time.

10:34.575 --> 10:35.709
I shouldn't have have said all that stuff.

10:35.810 --> 10:37.344
You know, I'm just curious.

10:37.411 --> 10:40.080
Am I one of those people who
just "sleepwalks through life"?

10:40.181 --> 10:42.649
It was out of context. I was upset.

10:42.750 --> 10:43.984
You were upset? So what?

10:44.051 --> 10:45.719
Does that mean you didn't say it?

10:45.820 --> 10:47.454
When people are upset, they
say things they don't mean.

10:47.456 --> 10:50.624
Oh, I disagree. I am very upset.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.125
And I do mean this.

10:52.226 --> 10:54.561
How the hell dare you?

10:54.662 --> 10:56.463
You were a total stranger to me

10:56.564 --> 10:59.633
and I took you into my life, my family...

10:59.700 --> 11:00.901
I tried to help you.

11:00.968 --> 11:03.670
I know. Christine, I know. I'm sorry.

11:03.771 --> 11:05.538
- I'm so sorry.
- I thought you had just gotten

11:05.606 --> 11:07.941
a bad rap and you needed some good friends.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.743
But you are a train wreck.

11:09.844 --> 11:13.246
Don't talk to me again.

11:13.314 --> 11:14.714
Oh, and by the way, the mayor is coming

11:14.782 --> 11:16.883
to our house for dinner tomorrow so...

11:16.984 --> 11:21.154
Let's see how that city council
position works out for you.

11:39.807 --> 11:45.312
Dinner's ready, honey. Sit down.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.247
What's wrong?

11:47.348 --> 11:49.783
Christine's mad at me.

11:49.884 --> 11:52.085
I yelled at George and
said a bunch of stupid stuff

11:52.186 --> 11:54.154
I probably shouldn't have said.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.323
I'm sorry.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.991
I don't know how this is gonna shake out.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.094
She can do a lot of damage in this town.

12:01.195 --> 12:03.063
I don't know what people want from me.

12:03.164 --> 12:05.098
I even went out with her brother.

12:05.199 --> 12:08.468
Tried to sleep with him.

12:08.536 --> 12:10.270
Anyway.

12:10.371 --> 12:13.073
Doesn't matter.

12:13.174 --> 12:16.576
We're together and that's
all that ever matters.

12:19.914 --> 12:21.414
Mmm.

12:21.482 --> 12:23.917
There's something I
need to tell you, mother.

12:24.018 --> 12:27.921
What?

12:28.022 --> 12:30.457
It's something that the Sheriff told me.

12:30.558 --> 12:33.526
And something I began to
realize when I was in that box.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.228
Norman, he already talked to me about it,

12:35.296 --> 12:38.431
about Blaire Watson. And the...

12:38.499 --> 12:40.834
the semen sample.

12:40.935 --> 12:42.202
It doesn't mean anything

12:42.303 --> 12:43.903
except that she was seducing young boys.

12:44.005 --> 12:45.772
What did Romero say?

12:45.840 --> 12:47.207
He... he...

12:47.308 --> 12:48.241
you know, he just insisted on you

12:48.309 --> 12:49.943
taking a polygraph test.

12:50.044 --> 12:51.311
Don't worry about it. It'll be fine.

12:51.412 --> 12:52.645
They ask you questions.
And you answer them.

12:52.747 --> 12:54.080
Yeah, but questions about what?

12:54.148 --> 12:55.715
Norman, there's nothing to worry about.

12:55.783 --> 12:57.784
Okay? You slept with
her. You didn't kill her.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.427
I think I did, mother.

13:09.430 --> 13:11.965
Don't say that.

13:12.066 --> 13:14.934
Why would you say that?

13:19.140 --> 13:20.240
When I was in the box,

13:20.341 --> 13:22.575
I had these... these memories,

13:22.676 --> 13:25.011
of things I never remembered before.

13:25.079 --> 13:29.082
Norman, you were trapped
in a box in the ground.

13:29.150 --> 13:30.850
You were out of your mind hallucinating.

13:30.951 --> 13:32.352
No, you listen to me!

13:32.420 --> 13:34.120
Okay, it wasn't a hallucination.

13:34.221 --> 13:35.288
It was a memory!

13:35.356 --> 13:39.225
I could feel it! It happened!

13:39.326 --> 13:40.326
I can still feel it.

13:40.428 --> 13:43.463
I remembered it the way

13:43.531 --> 13:48.368
you remember how gingerbread
tasted at Christmas.

13:50.738 --> 13:54.441
I saw myself having sex with miss Watson.

13:57.912 --> 14:00.180
And then I killed her.

14:06.921 --> 14:10.090
It makes everything make sense.

14:10.191 --> 14:12.559
I do things when I black out, don't I?

14:12.660 --> 14:15.395
That's why you wouldn't tell me.

14:15.463 --> 14:19.332
This is ridiculous, Norman. So ridiculous.

14:19.433 --> 14:21.868
You're convincing yourself
of something impossible.

14:21.936 --> 14:23.736
- You're traumatized.
- Mother, have to face it.

14:23.838 --> 14:26.005
Norman, stop it! Stop it right now!

14:26.107 --> 14:27.907
Stop!

14:32.012 --> 14:33.847
God.

14:41.555 --> 14:42.489
Eat your pot roast, honey.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.657
Come on, it's getting cold.

16:31.183 --> 16:34.118
Hi, Alex.

16:34.186 --> 16:36.887
How's... how's Norman doing?

16:36.988 --> 16:38.222
He's much better.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.490
Still not quite himself though.

16:39.558 --> 16:44.195
Well, glad he's doing better.

16:45.530 --> 16:47.565
I, uh...

16:47.632 --> 16:50.101
I scheduled that polygraph test.

16:50.202 --> 16:53.079
Here's the address, date, and the time.

16:54.442 --> 16:56.879
This soon? He needs to rest.

16:56.908 --> 16:58.175
He's been through so much.

16:58.276 --> 16:59.843
No, Norma, it's got to happen.

16:59.911 --> 17:02.012
I'm not happy about
it, but we need to know.

17:02.113 --> 17:04.114
There's enough circumstances here.

17:04.214 --> 17:05.848
I can't look away. I'm sorry.

17:05.916 --> 17:08.018
But I may have sent the wrong guy to prison

17:08.118 --> 17:09.386
for a crime he didn't do.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.221
And I can't live with that.

17:11.289 --> 17:13.123
And the only way I'm not
gonna reopen this case

17:13.223 --> 17:16.859
is if he passes that test.

17:22.032 --> 17:23.867
Okay.

18:03.975 --> 18:06.076
You'll be in room nine.

18:06.144 --> 18:07.544
Let me know if you need anything.

18:07.612 --> 18:09.713
Thank you.

18:15.620 --> 18:18.155
- Bates Motel.
- Oh, it's me, Emma.

18:18.256 --> 18:19.623
Would you mind bringing up my book?

18:19.724 --> 18:21.525
I think I left it on
the desk in the office.

18:21.626 --> 18:22.993
Yeah. Yeah, it's right here.

18:23.094 --> 18:24.962
I'll run it up to you.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.964
Thanks.

18:33.705 --> 18:36.240
- Hi.
- Oh.

18:36.341 --> 18:38.208
Come on in.

18:38.276 --> 18:39.943
How are you feeling?

18:40.011 --> 18:42.145
I've been better.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.413
What are you doing?

18:43.515 --> 18:46.825
Just getting my things in order.

18:46.938 --> 18:48.300
Shouldn't you be in bed?

18:53.191 --> 18:56.293
Do you remember this? Thanks.

19:01.948 --> 19:04.161
"Tiger, tiger, burning bright,"

19:04.202 --> 19:06.170
"in the forest of the night."

19:06.271 --> 19:09.407
Seems like a long time ago.

19:09.474 --> 19:13.210
Well, we were different people then.

19:16.181 --> 19:18.649
Mom tells me you're quitting.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.751
Why do you have to leave?

19:20.852 --> 19:23.187
Because, Norman, it's hard being here.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.522
You're such a close family.

19:24.589 --> 19:26.457
And I care about you so much,

19:26.558 --> 19:28.426
but it just feels like I'm on the outside.

19:28.493 --> 19:32.196
Like there's things going on
that you won't tell me about.

19:36.234 --> 19:38.202
We couldn't tell you that

19:38.303 --> 19:40.671
because it had something to do with Dylan.

19:44.242 --> 19:48.679
Okay, it was something he
wouldn't want anyone to know.

19:51.516 --> 19:53.384
Except family.

19:53.485 --> 19:58.155
Well, I'll tell you, Emma.

19:58.223 --> 20:02.760
Just never let Dylan know
because it'd kill him.

20:02.861 --> 20:08.466
When my mother was a teenager,
her brother raped her.

20:08.533 --> 20:13.235
Dylan's their child.

20:13.336 --> 20:15.371
That's why we couldn't tell you.

20:15.438 --> 20:18.607
Oh, my God.

20:18.708 --> 20:20.175
I...

20:20.243 --> 20:22.511
your poor mother.

20:22.579 --> 20:24.480
Poor Dylan.

20:24.547 --> 20:26.515
I'm so sorry. I-I-I'll never...

20:26.616 --> 20:31.620
I'll never tell anyone.

20:31.721 --> 20:34.023
My mother loves you, Emma.

20:34.090 --> 20:37.960
She loves having you here.

20:38.061 --> 20:42.531
Will you please think about staying?

20:44.634 --> 20:48.270
I'll think about it.

20:48.371 --> 20:50.739
Good.

20:56.112 --> 20:58.113
How do you know that?

20:58.181 --> 21:01.650
Because Dylan Massett killed him.

21:01.751 --> 21:04.019
How'd that happen?

21:04.120 --> 21:05.621
How do you think it happened?

21:05.722 --> 21:07.690
I worked him up into doing it.

21:07.757 --> 21:09.558
And he went and he did it.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.460
So now everything's changed.

21:11.561 --> 21:12.795
We need to talk.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.196
What about Dylan?

21:14.297 --> 21:16.598
I don't care.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.400
Whatever you want to do with him.

21:18.468 --> 21:21.170
- Cold.
- Shut up.

21:21.271 --> 21:23.172
Can you come over?

21:23.273 --> 21:25.574
- Yeah.
- Can you come now?

21:25.675 --> 21:27.209
Yeah. All right.

21:27.310 --> 21:28.444
Okay.

21:28.545 --> 21:31.113
I'll see you in a little bit.

22:08.113 --> 22:09.814
Was amazing pie, mom.

22:09.915 --> 22:11.416
Thank you for making it.

22:11.484 --> 22:12.784
Of course, honey.

22:12.852 --> 22:14.786
I love to cook for you.

22:22.061 --> 22:24.829
Alex scheduled that polygraph test.

22:24.930 --> 22:26.030
Okay, then.

22:26.131 --> 22:27.832
It's gonna be okay.

22:27.933 --> 22:29.968
I know it will.

22:37.710 --> 22:39.844
I need to go upstairs.
I want to wash my hair.

22:39.945 --> 22:42.447
You can do that later.

22:42.515 --> 22:45.650
Let's spend some time together.

22:45.718 --> 22:48.219
Okay. What do you want to do?

22:57.897 --> 22:59.163
This is a good one.

23:03.636 --> 23:05.637
What?

23:05.704 --> 23:06.838
Let's dance.

23:07.907 --> 23:09.107
You want to dance?

23:09.174 --> 23:11.643
Yeah, like we used to in the kitchen

23:11.710 --> 23:13.311
when I was little.

23:15.014 --> 23:16.981
Come on.

23:43.842 --> 23:45.677
You're the best mother in the world.

23:46.812 --> 23:48.379
I don't know, Norman.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.781
I hope so.

23:56.088 --> 23:58.022
You mean everything to me.

23:59.224 --> 24:01.793
I love you more than my own life.

24:03.762 --> 24:05.363
Me too.

24:21.580 --> 24:23.581
All right, here we go.

24:38.230 --> 24:40.231
Okay, listen to me... wait right here.

24:40.332 --> 24:42.333
No matter what happens, right here.

24:47.506 --> 24:50.074
You got any guns anywhere?

24:50.175 --> 24:52.276
Oh, yeah, guest bedroom is
where I keep all my guns.

24:52.344 --> 24:54.145
No, but there's one downstairs,

24:54.246 --> 24:56.814
in a gun cabinet.

24:56.882 --> 24:58.983
I'll go get it.

25:02.154 --> 25:05.323
Jodi!

25:30.816 --> 25:33.151
Yeah, I should have figured
you'd do something like this.

25:33.252 --> 25:34.952
You son of a bitch.

25:35.020 --> 25:37.088
I helped you when no one else would,

25:37.189 --> 25:39.757
and now, you cause all this?

25:39.825 --> 25:41.959
Put down the blade, Jodi.

25:42.027 --> 25:44.028
I have a gun. You see that, right?

25:44.096 --> 25:45.830
You don't think I'll shoot you?

25:47.299 --> 25:49.701
He's here with you?

25:49.802 --> 25:51.803
Aah!

25:51.904 --> 25:53.805
You bitch!

26:15.194 --> 26:16.694
You remember what I said?

26:16.762 --> 26:18.196
About burning you down?

26:18.297 --> 26:21.165
Well, I'm a man of my word.

26:33.112 --> 26:36.914
What happens now?

26:36.982 --> 26:40.485
All right, okay. Here's, um...

26:40.586 --> 26:43.054
Here's... here's what the story's gonna be.

26:43.155 --> 26:46.157
I got a tip by a confidential informant

26:46.258 --> 26:49.293
that Zane and his men,
they just killed Nick Ford.

26:49.394 --> 26:52.230
Then I came here to find out
if Jodi had any information

26:52.331 --> 26:54.098
about where he was, and when I arrived,

26:54.166 --> 26:56.901
Zane was already here.

26:56.969 --> 27:01.606
And I took out his men, but by
the time I got inside the house,

27:01.707 --> 27:03.808
he had shot her before
I could take him out.

27:08.614 --> 27:10.615
- What about me?
- You were never here.

27:18.624 --> 27:21.225
Why are you giving me a free pass?

27:21.326 --> 27:23.194
Not that I don't appreciate it.

27:25.330 --> 27:27.665
Because I think you get it.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.567
I think you're smart enough to understand

27:29.635 --> 27:32.036
how things work around
here. What you can do,

27:32.104 --> 27:35.106
what you can't do.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.610
And right now...

27:39.711 --> 27:42.380
right now, there's a vacuum.

27:42.481 --> 27:44.448
Somebody's gonna fill that vacuum.

27:44.550 --> 27:45.650
That's as inevitable as the
sun rising in the morning...

27:45.751 --> 27:47.351
I'm not your guy.

27:47.452 --> 27:48.319
I didn't sign on for any of this.

27:48.387 --> 27:50.188
Well, somebody's going to,

27:50.289 --> 27:52.256
and I want to be sure that
person who fills that vacuum,

27:52.357 --> 27:53.991
Dylan, understands the rules,

27:54.092 --> 27:56.894
because the rules are what make it possible

27:56.995 --> 28:01.799
for all of us to live here
together in a peaceful manner.

28:01.900 --> 28:04.836
Does that make sense to you?

28:04.937 --> 28:06.037
Dylan?

28:25.954 --> 28:27.921
Thanks for meeting me.

28:27.989 --> 28:30.123
What's going on?

28:33.962 --> 28:37.464
Norman had these... These memories

28:37.532 --> 28:40.567
when he was trapped in that box.

28:40.635 --> 28:43.136
He thinks that he killed Blaire Watson.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.107
I know, Dylan. I'm sorry
to dump this on you,

28:47.175 --> 28:49.042
but you're the only one I can tell.

28:49.143 --> 28:51.845
I don't know what to do.

28:51.913 --> 28:54.348
Romero wants him to take
a polygraph test tomorrow.

28:54.449 --> 28:56.883
He's gonna ask him if
he killed Blaire Watson.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.085
Norman's gonna go to prison.

28:58.186 --> 29:00.087
He... that can't happen.

29:00.188 --> 29:01.421
Can you imagine Norman in prison?

29:01.522 --> 29:03.557
He'll just dissolve.

29:05.093 --> 29:06.760
It just... it's not his fault.

29:06.828 --> 29:10.297
He doesn't even know he does these things.

29:10.365 --> 29:12.866
I bought tickets to Montreal, to fly.

29:12.967 --> 29:14.368
We can leave tonight.

29:14.469 --> 29:16.069
You can't do that. That's insane.

29:16.170 --> 29:19.172
I don't know what else to do.

29:22.777 --> 29:25.278
I got three tickets. I want you to come.

29:26.914 --> 29:28.815
You bought me a ticket?

29:33.955 --> 29:35.789
I'm sorry, Dylan.

29:35.857 --> 29:39.026
I'm so sorry, for everything.

29:39.127 --> 29:43.063
For how you were born, how I handled it.

29:43.131 --> 29:45.932
How I shut you out...
it was horrible of me,

29:46.034 --> 29:48.035
and I'm so sorry.

29:48.136 --> 29:49.970
It's not your fault,
Norma. You were just a kid.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.738
I didn't know what I was doing,

29:51.839 --> 29:54.408
but as horrible as it
was, I-I wouldn't trade it

29:54.475 --> 29:55.909
for anything, because you're here now,

29:56.010 --> 29:57.611
and you're beautiful,

29:57.678 --> 29:59.746
and you're a miracle, that someone like you

29:59.847 --> 30:02.449
could come out of all that.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.318
And I wouldn't give you up for anything.

30:28.076 --> 30:31.678
Listen to me.

30:31.779 --> 30:33.080
You can't leave town.

30:33.147 --> 30:37.150
He... he's innocent. He doesn't know.

30:37.251 --> 30:38.752
Then he's mentally ill.

30:38.853 --> 30:40.120
They'll send him to an institution...

30:40.221 --> 30:43.890
I don't want him in an institution.

30:46.961 --> 30:50.330
If he did this thing, then...

30:50.431 --> 30:53.500
He needs to be somewhere
he can be protected.

30:53.601 --> 30:58.238
At least, someplace other
people are protected.

30:58.339 --> 31:01.708
You need to know the truth, Norma.

31:04.178 --> 31:08.014
If you really love him, then...

31:08.082 --> 31:10.083
If you really love him and
you want to protect him,

31:10.184 --> 31:14.821
then he needs to take the test.

31:30.838 --> 31:32.739
Norman, I'm home!

31:36.377 --> 31:38.578
Norman?

31:42.350 --> 31:44.384
Norman?

31:49.857 --> 31:51.858
Norman?

32:18.953 --> 32:21.021
Norman!

32:28.229 --> 32:30.297
Norman!

32:39.941 --> 32:42.342
- Have you seen Norman?
- I-I just saw him.

32:42.443 --> 32:43.977
He said he was taking a walk in the woods.

32:44.078 --> 32:45.011
He just headed across the street.

32:45.079 --> 32:46.346
How long ago?

32:46.447 --> 32:49.249
Right before your car pulled up.

33:07.468 --> 33:09.803
Norman!

33:27.021 --> 33:28.054
Norman!

33:30.091 --> 33:31.625
Where are you?

33:31.726 --> 33:34.995
Norman!

33:42.803 --> 33:43.970
Norman, come back here!

33:45.940 --> 33:48.008
Stop!

33:51.912 --> 33:53.146
Stop.

34:07.461 --> 34:08.661
I'm sorry, mother.

34:08.763 --> 34:10.764
I didn't mean to hurt you.

34:10.864 --> 34:13.300
But I am gonna do this, and
you're not gonna stop me.

34:13.400 --> 34:14.934
Why?

34:15.036 --> 34:16.703
'Cause I don't want to be who I am.

34:16.771 --> 34:19.239
- Why?
- And I don't want to hurt you.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.976
There's something wrong with me. I'm bad.

34:24.045 --> 34:26.146
You're not bad! You're innocent.

34:26.246 --> 34:28.081
You've never meant to
hurt anybody in your life.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.748
But I did. I know I did.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.518
You don't know what's real
and what's not, Norman.

34:31.619 --> 34:34.254
You have these blackouts,
and they confuse you.

34:35.690 --> 34:37.891
I had a blackout the day my dad died.

34:43.397 --> 34:45.498
What happened that day, mother?

34:45.599 --> 34:48.935
Give me the gun and I'll tell you.

35:02.350 --> 35:06.553
He was hurting me, and you
were trying to protect me.

35:09.457 --> 35:11.791
You've always been there to protect me.

35:20.334 --> 35:22.836
How can you ask me to live with this?

35:22.903 --> 35:26.306
Because I will die if you leave.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.074
I will, I'll die, Norman.

35:28.175 --> 35:29.843
We're like the same person.

35:29.910 --> 35:32.812
If you kill yourself, I'll
be there one step after.

35:35.916 --> 35:39.319
We have to be together.
We're supposed to be together.

35:39.420 --> 35:43.690
No matter what, I will
be with you every step.

35:43.791 --> 35:47.293
I will be right by your side,

35:47.361 --> 35:49.829
and we will face this together.

35:49.897 --> 35:53.099
Please. Please.

36:01.008 --> 36:02.409
Please.

36:02.510 --> 36:06.613
Please.

36:08.382 --> 36:10.450
All right, mother.

36:14.021 --> 36:16.156
You win.

37:55.437 --> 37:57.338
- We're ready to go.
- All right.

37:59.174 --> 38:02.510
Uh, yeah, Norma, Dylan, why
don't you wait right here?

38:02.611 --> 38:04.044
Okay.

38:04.145 --> 38:06.614
Go ahead, Norman. We'll be right here.

38:06.715 --> 38:09.383
I love you.

38:09.451 --> 38:11.719
It's gonna be okay.

38:11.820 --> 38:14.455
All right. Let's go.

38:27.925 --> 38:30.460
Is your name Norman Bates?

38:30.561 --> 38:32.562
Yes.

38:32.630 --> 38:35.098
Do you live in White Pine Bay?

38:35.199 --> 38:38.902
Yes.

38:39.003 --> 38:41.938
