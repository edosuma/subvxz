WEBVTT

00:07.842 --> 00:10.003
Kane is in the building, nigga...

00:23.524 --> 00:26.436
Now tell me how ya love it
You know you at the top

00:26.527 --> 00:29.860
When only heaven ’3 right above it, we on

00:30.656 --> 00:32.521
’Cause we on

00:32.992 --> 00:35.984
Who else is really trying to fuck
With Hollywood Cole?

00:36.078 --> 00:37.614
I’m with Marley G, bro

00:37.705 --> 00:40.538

To my Hollywood shows

00:40.625 --> 00:43.867
And / wanna tell you
Something that you probably should know

00:43.961 --> 00:46.828
This that
Slumdog Millionaire Bol/ywood flow

00:47.089 --> 00:48.499
And

00:48.591 --> 00:50.456
My real friends never hearing from me

00:50.551 --> 00:53.884
Fake friends write the wrong
Answers on the mirror for me

00:53.971 --> 00:56.883
That’s why / pick and choose
/ don ’t get shit confused

00:56.974 --> 01:00.262
Don ’t like my women sing/e
/ like my chicks in twos

01:00.353 --> 01:03.060
And these days all the girls
is down to roll

01:03.189 --> 01:05.555
/ hit the strip club

01:06.359 --> 01:09.351
Plus, lbeen sippin’
So this shit is movin’ kinda slow

01:09.445 --> 01:13.188
Just tell my girl to
Tell her friend that it’s time to go

01:18.246 --> 01:20.077
There's a ton of excitement
here in San Francisco

01:20.206 --> 01:22.697
about what might come
from this weekend's owners' meetings.

01:22.792 --> 01:24.282
It might be excitement
here in San Francisco,

01:24.377 --> 01:26.242
but across the bay here in Oakland,

01:26.337 --> 01:28.578
they're about getting ready
to burn their Oakland Raiderjerseys.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.124
Man, it's a done deal, dawg.

01:30.216 --> 01:32.423
Once the Governor of Nevada
passed legislation,

01:32.510 --> 01:34.967
sorry to tell Yay Area, it's a wrap.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.090
Listen, if I'm Mark Davis,
I'm not packing my bags

01:37.181 --> 01:40.048
until I get final approval
from the other owners and the league.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.053
My sources have, in fact, confirmed

01:42.270 --> 01:45.182
that Mark Davis has secured
a new barber in Las Vegas.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.264
Hair jokes, hair jokes from bald guys.

01:47.358 --> 01:49.144
-Jealousy!
-Let it go...

01:50.695 --> 01:51.730
Hey.

01:52.113 --> 01:53.148
Hey.

01:55.658 --> 01:56.773
Day after.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.071
"It's never too late."

01:59.203 --> 02:00.989
Yeah, I'm sorry about
the misfire last night.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.283
I thought I had
a couple more pumps in me.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.457
(CHUCKLES) Don't worry, I'm not trying
to wring another apology out of you.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.284
Yeah, but it was all out of passion.

02:08.421 --> 02:10.377
And lwas so in the moment. (CHUCKLES)

02:10.506 --> 02:12.042
Plus, l was fucking hammered.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.293
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

02:14.010 --> 02:16.877
Jesus, they package these things
like Russian stacking dolls.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.302
I feel like by the time | get this open,

02:18.389 --> 02:20.175
there's gonna be a smaller paper bag

02:20.266 --> 02:23.349
with a smaller box
and a smaller pill inside.

02:23.436 --> 02:24.892
Hey, you know,
maybe they make them that way

02:24.979 --> 02:26.594
so you can reconsider.

02:26.689 --> 02:28.225
Yeah, or maybe they want
my water to break

02:28.316 --> 02:29.931
before I can take the damn thing.

02:32.403 --> 02:33.563
You tense about the proposal?

02:34.113 --> 02:36.229
Yeah, a little.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.489
You know, urn,
boss man has the owners in his pocket,

02:39.577 --> 02:42.034
but my pitch is airtight,
but you never know.

02:42.121 --> 02:44.112
-It would be a big payday for you.
-Yeah.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.326
Hey, Chloe, maybe, urn,

02:47.376 --> 02:48.752
maybe you don't take that.

02:49.754 --> 02:50.960
What?

02:51.630 --> 02:53.131
You never thought about having a kid?

02:53.382 --> 02:56.499
I wasn't thinking about it right now.

02:56.802 --> 02:57.962
(CHUCKLES)

02:59.597 --> 03:00.928
Well, maybe we should.

03:02.183 --> 03:05.300
Is this because your midlife crisis

03:05.394 --> 03:07.555
has you suddenly wanting a child,

03:07.730 --> 03:11.018
or is this because you wanna
have a child with me?

03:12.068 --> 03:14.150
Feed it, change it, teach it,

03:14.862 --> 03:18.150
love it together as a family?

03:21.035 --> 03:23.242
-Yeah.
-Change of gate.

03:23.621 --> 03:25.031
We have a change of gate.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.113
Flight 729 to Dulles

03:27.208 --> 03:29.494
will now be departing at gate 15.

03:30.961 --> 03:34.419
Well, my flight is about to board.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.125
Good luck in San Fran.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.378
I hope you're more eloquent
with the owners

03:38.469 --> 03:39.754
than you were with me.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.428
We board in ten.

03:48.354 --> 03:50.265
l was gonna come over and say hi,
but I don't know,

03:50.356 --> 03:52.187
it looked like it was
getting pretty deep over here.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.768
You okay?

03:54.944 --> 03:56.229
I don't fucking know.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.776
(CHUCKLES)

03:57.863 --> 03:59.319
That usually means you're not.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.776
No one knows this roster better than me.

04:01.951 --> 04:03.942
I'll put 53 men on the field

04:04.036 --> 04:06.243
that Dolphins fans can be proud of.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.241
Build this team with toughness.

04:08.332 --> 04:09.947
I intend to win football games,

04:10.042 --> 04:11.907
and a lot of them, come September.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.917
Mark my words.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.130
What about your age?

04:15.673 --> 04:16.788
What about your face?

04:17.383 --> 04:18.839
What about my face?

04:18.926 --> 04:20.382
That's what you're
gonna be asking the medic

04:20.469 --> 04:23.302
-after I slap you silly, kid. (LAUGHS)
-(ALL LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING)

04:23.389 --> 04:25.596
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.304
Thank you.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.100
Man, you got me all fired up and ready

04:34.191 --> 04:35.852
to get back in the trenches
and bash some heads.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.605
No, you're too valuable upstairs.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.732
And, by the way,
thank you for what you've done.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.984
Oh, no, this move was long overdue.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.191
No, what's overdue
is the Lombardi Trophy.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.902
Now, we need to get out
and find some guys

04:47.997 --> 04:49.953
that can knock the snot out of people.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.826
Yeah, sure hope I'm around for that.

04:52.877 --> 04:54.538
Siefert's gonna go on the warpath

04:54.628 --> 04:56.038
'cause I went over his head.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.541
I wouldn't worry about that.

04:58.924 --> 05:01.131
You don't know
his dark side like I know it.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.595
Hey, look around.
Do you see Siefert here?

05:06.724 --> 05:07.884
You took care of me,

05:08.476 --> 05:10.341
now it's my turn to take care of you.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.023
(TRAM BELL RINGING)

05:19.320 --> 05:21.402
Dude, you gotta let the Chloe thing go.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.229
Oh, my God,
I'm looking at Bleacher Report.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.313
No, you're not!

05:24.408 --> 05:26.239
You're checking to see
if she called you or texted you.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.113
You had your fucking phone
off airplane mode

05:28.204 --> 05:29.569
before we even touched down.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.154
If I were an air marshal,
I would've arrested you

05:33.501 --> 05:35.332
for being a fucking pussy.

05:35.419 --> 05:36.454
Wow.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.961
-l'm worried about her.
-Bullshit!

05:39.048 --> 05:41.585
You just put
20 people out of work, Spence.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.212
Right now, the only thing
you need to be worried about

05:44.303 --> 05:45.509
is nailing that proposal.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.427
We're past the point of no return.

05:48.224 --> 05:50.135
(SIGHS) You can go back

05:50.226 --> 05:53.889
to screwing up your relationship
with Chloe after, I promise.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.597
First stop, Fairmont Hotel.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.731
Look, you're not a bad guy.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.684
I don't agree with this sale,

06:01.779 --> 06:04.111
but myjob is to back you up
no matter what.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.655
So go stand tall
in this meet with the Raiders.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.323
Okay? Focus on the endgame.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.570
Thank you. I'll talk to you later.

06:09.662 --> 06:10.697
Love you, buddy.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.040
-Are you here for the owners' meeting?
-Yeah.

06:17.253 --> 06:19.619
Long way from
burying quarterbacks, I'll tell you.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.546
Man, I would kill for a clean shot
at Jay Cutler right now.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.544
That dopey motherfucker's O-line

06:24.635 --> 06:26.500
would part like the Red Sea.

06:26.595 --> 06:27.971
(LAUGHING)

06:28.973 --> 06:30.759
Silver and black
would've suited you perfectly.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.884
-You think so?
-Yeah.

06:31.976 --> 06:34.763
Man, your style of play was
made for the Raider brand.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.639
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

06:41.986 --> 06:43.021
(SIGHS)

06:45.281 --> 06:47.397
Next stop, Raider Nation.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.245
Nah, I wanna take care of us.
Please come back.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.417
I'm ready to be a dad.

06:58.043 --> 07:01.080
Yeah, look, we don't have
to worry about that now, okay?

07:01.171 --> 07:02.331
All right, have a good day at work.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.129
Oh. Amber,

07:05.593 --> 07:07.174
-I love you.
-(GLASS SHATTERS)

07:10.306 --> 07:11.842
Let me get you a towel for that.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.310
Did you take your medication?

07:16.186 --> 07:17.221
Yeah.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.596
I think it's time
to roll back your dosage.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.896
What you talking about?

07:21.066 --> 07:22.397
You just got rid of Amber.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.735
Now you're trying to bring her back?

07:23.819 --> 07:26.401
She sent me
this ultrasound picture from LA.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.399
I started missing her.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.525
You barely even know this girl.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.027
How the fuck can you
be in love with her?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.483
I mean, I'm not in love with her,

07:32.578 --> 07:34.239
but I do love her.

07:34.330 --> 07:35.365
She's my baby mama.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.367
I think these pills
are making things worse.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.164
The shrink don't know
you got a concussion.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.286
Neither do the Pats.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.788
Well, they don't need to know.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.920
You're signing
your new contract this afternoon.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.501
That's today?

07:46.592 --> 07:48.207
Yeah, the Pats
are on their way down from Boston.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.542
What the fuck are you gonna do?

07:49.637 --> 07:51.298
Take whatever offer they give me.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.470
The concussion will go away eventually.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.343
Don't pin the new attitude
on the pills either.

07:55.434 --> 07:56.890
I know how to embrace change.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.136
-Send this to Amber.
-(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

08:00.648 --> 08:02.013
That baby look like Dennis.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.022
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
So, uh, Mark running a little late?

08:08.739 --> 08:11.321
Well, truth is things have gotten
somewhat complicated.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.989
Now that the governor
signed legislation,

08:13.077 --> 08:14.567
there's been a surge
of interest in the move.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.448
-The Raiders are hot, baby.
-(SPENCER LAUGHS)

08:16.538 --> 08:18.449
Mark's dealing with a competing offer.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.369
-What?
-lt's a new group that came in.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.449
Very aggressive.

08:22.544 --> 08:23.954
Okay, well,
I've been aggressive, too, huh?

08:24.046 --> 08:25.957
-What the fuck is this, Tim?
-Whoa, Spence.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.130
Come on, you know Tim's position
on foul language.

08:28.217 --> 08:31.755
We expect you to respect that,
so ixnay the ucksfay.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.631
Uckfay. Who is it?

08:35.099 --> 08:36.384
-Can't say.
-Come on, we were in

08:36.475 --> 08:37.806
a good faith negotiation.

08:37.893 --> 08:38.973
It's a fluid situation.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.176
l was here when it mattered.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.226
I helped you break down walls.
You should've told me.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.726
Told you what?
It wasn't real until today.

08:44.817 --> 08:46.557
Now they're coming in
with a boatload of cash.

08:46.652 --> 08:47.687
Okay, we have the cash,

08:47.778 --> 08:49.894
we have the land to build the stadium,
we have it all.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.445
But you're not endorsed by the league.
This new group is.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.400
The league? You trust the goddamn...
the gosh darn league?

08:55.494 --> 08:57.655
No, but nothing gets done
without their stamp.

08:57.746 --> 08:58.781
Shifty as they may be,

08:58.872 --> 09:00.578
they have the power to
shut this whole thing down.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.122
Okay, then somebody should remind Mark

09:02.209 --> 09:04.996
that they couldn't stop his dad
from taking the Raiders to LA. in '82.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.998
Mark isn't Al.
He's taking a new approach.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.545
And these are much different times.

09:08.632 --> 09:09.667
Yeah.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.711
A man's word once meant something.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.254
You're still in the running.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.799
You have a great package
with powerful partners.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.221
And Mark looks forward
to hearing your enhanced proposal.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.969
-We all do.
-"Enhanced proposal"?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.301
What the fuck...
what the ucksay does that mean?

09:22.396 --> 09:23.431
You gotta step it up.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.854
Try giving us a fresh approach.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.070
Can I come in?

09:38.620 --> 09:39.826
Grab me that box.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.492
You do somersaults coming down the hall?

09:42.708 --> 09:44.869
Could've sworn I felt
the building shaking.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.126
I'd probably
blow out my knee if I tried.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.375
You played the game well, Charles.

09:50.632 --> 09:51.792
Made all the right moves,

09:51.884 --> 09:54.250
waited for the best time to strike,
then took it.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.886
Hey, man, ljust wanted
to get the best coach.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.096
It was never my intention
for them to let you go.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.891
One of these days, you're gonna
have to recognize you're a killer.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.093
Only way to survive the front office.

10:05.898 --> 10:07.308
Ain't no joy in this for me.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.433
lwouldn't even be standing here
if it weren't for you.

10:10.778 --> 10:11.984
You're a quick study.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.986
Look, come on,
don't throw away your favorite mug.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.990
A fan waited at the gate
to give that to me on my first day.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.737
To remind me what to strive for.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.615
We make it back to the playoffs
and I'm out the door.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.497
Just doesn't seem right.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.791
You should keep it
for when they bump you up.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.417
(SCOFFS) Yeah, right.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.086
I'm sure I'm at the top
of their shortlist

10:31.173 --> 10:33.038
with only one year
under my belt as an assistant.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.293
You're more than that, Charles.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.249
A coach and GM gotta work as one.

10:36.553 --> 10:37.838
Now they hired Csonka,

10:37.930 --> 10:39.591
you're the natural choice
to take my place.

10:40.516 --> 10:42.928
You have an exceptional ability
to evaluate talent.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.551
Picking out the stars
and the bottom guys isn't hard.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.522
But finding those guys in the middle,

10:48.190 --> 10:49.680
that's how you earn your keep.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.391
Guess it's just instinct.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.521
It's conviction.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.569
Same as I had in you.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.110
Goodbye, Charles.

11:06.542 --> 11:07.577
(LAUGHTER)

11:07.668 --> 11:09.204
Yo, you and Spence
hitting the town tonight?

11:09.294 --> 11:10.909
This time, don't leave my ass, dawg.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.211
You take too long getting your makeup on
or something.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.549
-Oh, that's how it is now?
-Trust me,

11:14.633 --> 11:15.873
you wanted to be left last year.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.083
First time I ever stole a car.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.678
-You stole a car?
-Damnl

11:18.762 --> 11:19.877
Man, you're lucky you didn't go.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.303
Your black ass would still be in jail.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.802
Yeah, you know that, brother,
especially right now.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.507
You should've seen Spencer. Oh, my gosh!

11:25.602 --> 11:27.684
He was like a donkey at
a Tijuana donkey show, out of control.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.432
You know, I thought that thing
was like Sasquatch.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.309
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
-You know, a total urban legend.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.810
Excuse me, guys.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.862
-Hey, how'd it go?
-Well, the shitjust hit the fan

11:37.531 --> 11:39.021
-Don't fuck with me.
-l'm not.

11:39.116 --> 11:41.573
That evil bitch Candace
just endorsed a competing offer.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.946
What? She’s been trying to keep
the team out of Vegas.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.528
Well, it turns out
it's not Vegas she hates.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.409
Well, she was totally fair with me.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.411
lt’s ’cause she was totally faking
when you met with her.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.878
Yeah, well,
it wouldn't be the first time

11:51.962 --> 11:53.998
a woman faked it with me. (CHUCKLES)

11:54.590 --> 11:56.000
I'll see you when you get here, okay?

11:56.091 --> 11:57.126
All right.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.719
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:02.306 --> 12:03.842
-Mr. Krutel.
-Yeah.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.047
Good to see you.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.224
Glad to see Vernon's
staying off the pipe.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.142
You guys are finally being productive.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.185
-(LAUGHS) All right.
-Excuse me.

12:11.607 --> 12:15.020
Yeah, uh, thank you
for knocking down Vern's suspension.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.145
That was very nice.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.029
It's the right thing to do.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.774
I guess I'm not
such an evil bitch after all.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.697
(LAUGHING) What?

12:22.784 --> 12:24.615
I never called you an...

12:26.079 --> 12:27.114
That.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.911
I'm sure Spencer
has tried to spin it that way.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.034
We've had our differences.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.240
That's just business.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.873
He has always referred to you
with the utmost respect, as have I.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.203
-l'm sure.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.373
So, uh, what you got cooking here?

12:39.593 --> 12:41.003
I'm not much of a cook,

12:41.428 --> 12:43.464
but I can dial for takeout
with the best.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.474
(LAUGHS) I don't know.
I think you're a pretty good cook.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.059
Yeah, stealthy.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.846
You've been whipping up a Vegas stew
for a few weeks, huh?

12:50.938 --> 12:52.519
Oh, I'm just watching Roger's back.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.812
No skin in the game.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.188
Yeah, guess so.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.062
Guess so. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

13:02.032 --> 13:03.147
Evil bitch.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.277
You should've told me sooner.

13:05.369 --> 13:06.859
Ricky would've
freaked the fuck out, man!

13:06.954 --> 13:07.989
He swore me to secrecy.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.116
Yeah, but four months
after the season is not a good sign!

13:10.207 --> 13:12.289
I know that,
and the fact that he's hiding it

13:12.376 --> 13:13.411
means that he knows it, too.

13:13.502 --> 13:14.867
Could be chronic
this late in his career.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.169
Yeah, and pair that
with the bipolar shit...

13:17.547 --> 13:19.583
I think he should retire
while he's still got all his marbles.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.041
Oh, you thought he'd freak out
for you telling me about the concussion?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.626
You wait till you see what he does
if you tell him to retire.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.507
Might be more receptive than you think.

13:26.682 --> 13:28.263
You can kick that boy
in the nuts right now

13:28.350 --> 13:29.510
and get a thank you out of him.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.886
Your boy's gone soft.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.096
Man, what are you, four?

13:32.187 --> 13:33.768
Put the fucking ice cream cone down.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.106
Fuck you, Dennis. This is my snack!

13:35.190 --> 13:36.555
Then eat it out a bowl then, like a man.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.936
Don't tell me how to eat.
I don't tell you how to eat...

13:39.027 --> 13:40.437
I can't talk to you seriously...

13:40.529 --> 13:43.145
Hey, hey, hey, look, I'm gonna need
y'all to clear the hell outta here.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.322
Can't have y'all arguing
about ice cream cones and shit

13:45.409 --> 13:46.774
while I'm handling business.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.779
(QUIETLY) Tell him.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.532
Hey, son, uh, we need to talk.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.584
-You told him.
-I had to, man!

13:57.671 --> 13:59.081
I haven't slept right
since you found out.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.503
You sleep 14 hours a day.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.796
Yeah, but it hasn't been as restful.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.669
Man, look, this is serious.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.047
Look, I got a bunch of friends

14:06.138 --> 14:09.130
who are struggling
with the dementia and the depression

14:09.474 --> 14:10.554
for getting their bell rung.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.973
My bell is fine.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.721
Dave Duerson, a friend of mine,

14:14.187 --> 14:16.348
you know, I saw what the game
did to the man.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.058
He shot himself in the chest

14:18.150 --> 14:20.562
with his Man of the Year award
sitting right next to him

14:20.652 --> 14:23.064
and a note that said
he wanted his brain studied.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.479
All I'm saying, Ricky,
is get medical help.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.364
Then after you heal,
then decide if you wanna play on.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.544
There's a lot of folks don't like to see

14:44.634 --> 14:46.499
what life's like for the have-nots.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.131
You know, I used to be a have-not.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.928
That don't seem to be the case anymore.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.552
Don't let this tie fool you.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.220
-What's your name?
-Melvin. Melvin Graham.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.098
Melvin Graham, Spencer Strasmore.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.481
It's good to meet you.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.600
Likewise.

14:59.733 --> 15:00.813
Where you from?

15:00.901 --> 15:02.311
Ah, just three blocks east.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.527
You a Raiders fan?

15:05.739 --> 15:06.979
Runs in the blood.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.531
You gonna be sad to see 'em go?

15:10.827 --> 15:13.079
(SIGHS) You know, it's hard to say.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.120
I mean, they dipped once before,

15:15.207 --> 15:17.118
but like a good woman, they came back.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.369
(LAUGHS)

15:18.460 --> 15:20.621
Just gonna hurt a little more
now that they're ballin'

15:20.712 --> 15:22.293
and Beast Mode is back.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.204
You drive exclusively for the team?

15:24.299 --> 15:25.630
Twenty-plus years.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.712
Started when they got back from LA.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.926
| used to drive for Al.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.255
Now I drive whoever needs driving.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.223
Best gig I ever had.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.221
Guess how many kids I got.

15:38.772 --> 15:39.807
One? Two, tops.

15:39.898 --> 15:40.933
Eight.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.974
Not to mention six grandkids
with two more on the way.

15:44.069 --> 15:46.105
Wow! Putting in that work, Melvin.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.811
They're a pain in my ass, too.

15:48.657 --> 15:51.023
Those little bastards
are worth every cent, though.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.400
You know, you should try it sometime.

15:53.537 --> 15:54.572
How do you know I haven't?

15:54.663 --> 15:55.698
The way you talking,

15:55.789 --> 15:58.326
ain't no chance
in west hell you got kids.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.451
(CHUCKLES) How am I talking?

15:59.543 --> 16:02.785
Like ain't nothing more important
in life than yourjob.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.749
Siefert's playoff record was abysmal.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.672
He wasn't exactly helped
by his scouting staff.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.628
Eh, Siefert hired those scouts.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.638
-Touche.
-What would you do with them?

16:17.686 --> 16:19.301
You know, I'd clean house.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.519
A lot of talent to be found out there.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.313
Definitely allocate
some more money to the department.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.861
Right now, we're at about
three million per year,

16:27.070 --> 16:29.061
which is less than
2% than we spend on the players.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.235
Hey, listen, the reason
I asked you down here,

16:35.328 --> 16:36.943
we are not gonna let you go.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.072
I want you to stay on
in the number two spot.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.751
-Oh, okay.
-Yep.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.499
We just need to find your new boss.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.043
Charles Greane is here
for the organization.

16:49.134 --> 16:50.340
Well, hold down the fort.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.668
Something comes up,
run it by Csonka or myself.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.049
We're gonna move fast on this hire.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.259
Just one last thing.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.392
Won't the new GM
wanna bring on his own number two?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.193
Well, that's up to him.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.276
I can't make any promises there.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.106
Last time I saw this much white hair,

17:15.202 --> 17:17.284
l was watching the History channel.
(EXCLAIMS)

17:17.370 --> 17:18.576
(LAUGHS)

17:18.663 --> 17:21.120
Okay, well, listen,
why don't you stop being a hater

17:21.208 --> 17:23.290
and go out here, find your trophy wife?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.456
(CHUCKLES) Oh, okay.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.416
(SIGHS) Hello.

17:29.090 --> 17:32.082
Well, congratulations, Spencer.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.883
You're at the top of the heap.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.132
-Not yet.
-Hmm.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.224
So, uh, Candace, tell me,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.973
which one of these assholes
do l have to take out?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.898
I'm not sure what you mean.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.644
Well, what I mean is
I had a very solid deal

17:48.735 --> 17:51.852
that everybody was on board with

17:51.947 --> 17:53.938
until you came in and endorsed

17:54.032 --> 17:56.614
a dark horse in the 11th hour.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.953
They brought us a complete package,

17:59.037 --> 18:00.743
invited us into the process,

18:00.830 --> 18:02.661
showed the respect we deserve.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.330
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

18:05.252 --> 18:07.868
You still think I took a shot at you
on Glazer's show

18:07.963 --> 18:09.453
-all those years ago, don't you?
-(SIGHS)

18:09.547 --> 18:11.003
Spencer, it is so sad

18:11.091 --> 18:13.673
how you dismiss my opinions
and brush me off.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.217
Candace, I would've done and said
the same thing if you were a man.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.589
Well, I'm not a man.

18:17.889 --> 18:21.052
And that's more threatening to you
than anything. (CHUCKLES)

18:21.142 --> 18:23.007
Though, I'm sure if we were fucking,

18:23.103 --> 18:24.718
I'd be permitted a point of view.

18:26.815 --> 18:29.477
You think I'm coming on to you
'cause I mentioned us fucking.

18:29.693 --> 18:32.025
(LAUGHS) Hey. No, okay?

18:32.112 --> 18:33.568
Just because you deal
with football players

18:33.655 --> 18:34.895
doesn't mean that you have me pegged.

18:34.990 --> 18:36.230
It's written all over your face.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.861
God damn, Candace, what is your problem?

18:38.952 --> 18:39.987
I mean, jee...

18:40.287 --> 18:41.322
Hello.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.036
-Table's yours.
-Thank you.

18:46.334 --> 18:49.167
I mean, come on,
I'm not running around, abusing women.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.165
I'm not grabbing anybody by the pussy.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.209
(BOTH LAUGH)

18:53.842 --> 18:55.002

18:55.093 --> 18:58.210

18:58.513 --> 19:00.049
Some rise above it, some don't.

19:00.140 --> 19:03.223
I'd like to think that l have,
but I still make mistakes.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.933
You working for the League
doesn't help matters.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.351
Candace,

19:10.900 --> 19:13.357
if I have done anything to offend you,

19:14.571 --> 19:15.856
I apologize.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.115
Okay, I accept.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.364
Great!

19:23.455 --> 19:24.991
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.656
Now will you tell me who's in
on the competing offer?

19:27.751 --> 19:28.786
No.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.826
-Just like a woman.
-(LAUGHS)

19:33.340 --> 19:35.080
Spencer, this deal is far bigger

19:35.175 --> 19:38.292
than you or your views
on the fairer sex.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.543
Take a look around this room, Spencer.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.301
Now, which one of us

19:44.392 --> 19:47.134
is different from the others? Hmm?

19:48.646 --> 19:51.023
You simply don't belong here.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.474
And neither do you.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.895
You're right.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.648
That's why we should merge the bids.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.569
The new group assumes majority
of the financial responsibility

20:01.659 --> 20:02.990
while yours takes a back seat,

20:03.078 --> 20:04.693
but still benefits in the end.

20:04.788 --> 20:05.948
Everyone profits.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.616
And your boss Anderson

20:07.707 --> 20:10.665
doesn't need to sacrifice ASM
to get what he wants.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.993
-He already has.
-Well, there's still time to pivot.

20:13.755 --> 20:16.167
Join with the other investors, Spencer.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.006
You can't win.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.508
They won't let you.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.230
Belichick wanted to come,
but he's stuck in Nantucket.

20:31.314 --> 20:33.350
Yeah, well, he wouldn't leave
'Sconset in the summer

20:33.441 --> 20:34.601
to sign J.J. Watt.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.399
Appreciate you coming down.

20:36.903 --> 20:37.938
Guess you want a first look

20:38.029 --> 20:39.485
to make sure I ain't speaking in tongues

20:39.572 --> 20:41.733
and smearing feces on the wall, huh?

20:41.991 --> 20:43.322
(CHUCKLES) Brady does it all the time.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.321
That wouldn't keep us
from putting you on the field.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.994
We got a two-year deal,
20 million total,

20:48.081 --> 20:50.447
10 per year, 16 guaranteed.

20:50.542 --> 20:51.873
Just need you to sign here.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.325

20:58.049 --> 20:59.084

20:59.175 --> 21:00.255

21:02.804 --> 21:03.839

21:06.433 --> 21:10.017
Okay, just go ahead and sign, Rick.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.344
-Ricky?
-l have a concussion.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.727
No, he doesn't.
That's the bipolar talking.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.854
-Take it back.
-l've had it for months.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.315
A private doctor diagnosed me,

21:21.406 --> 21:24.148
and, honestly, I haven't told anybody,
including my agent.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.191
-Sorry, J.
-Are you serious?

21:26.286 --> 21:27.321
So, you're not bipolar?

21:27.412 --> 21:28.447
No, I'm that, too.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.074
But I'm taking the medication.

21:30.165 --> 21:33.578
So, bipolar with a concussion.
That's uncharted territory.

21:33.668 --> 21:35.704
Look, I really appreciate
you being up front with us.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.786
Well, it'd be good for me
to see the team doc, right?

21:37.881 --> 21:39.587
I wanna get proper medical attention.

21:39.674 --> 21:40.914
I'm not trying to rush on the field.

21:41.009 --> 21:42.545
Absolutely. Why don't I step outside?

21:42.635 --> 21:44.091
I'll make that phone call right now.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.214
Sounds good.

21:50.268 --> 21:51.348
(DOOR OPENS)

21:51.436 --> 21:53.677
Why didn't you tell me
this earlier, Ricky?

21:53.980 --> 21:55.186
l was afraid.

21:55.773 --> 21:56.979
Now I'm at peace with it.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.185
Good.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.280
That'd be a good guess.

-Hey, I gotta tell you something, Mel,

22:23.092 --> 22:24.127
you weren't shittin'.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.050
This is the best barbecue
I've ever had, brother.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.843
Yeah? You sure you ain't been
to some better place

22:27.931 --> 22:29.887
Off the South Of France
you might've forgot about?

22:29.974 --> 22:32.590
(LAUGHS) Do I look like
I go tO fucking France?

22:32.685 --> 22:34.061
Is the place always jumping like this?

22:34.145 --> 22:36.136
Hey, man, Friday night special,
a sure bet.

is when the Raiders are playing.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.309

22:39.692 --> 22:41.808
Do you think this place
gonna survive the move?

22:41.903 --> 22:44.440
Well, you know, I mean,
the move's not official.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.021
You know, anything could happen, right?

22:46.115 --> 22:48.322
-Yeah.
-Man, I put my hard-earned money

22:48.409 --> 22:50.695
-On Spencer Strasmore many times...
-Come on, brother.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.277
...and the man always
came through for me.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.579
Let me tell you something,
that was on the football field, though.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.032
This corporate shit
is a different beast.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.457
"Different beast." I don't know.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.501
But you know what?
NO Offense, man, but, you know,

23:00.588 --> 23:01.748
I hope you and your deal

23:01.839 --> 23:03.090
fall flat on your ass.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.039
I mean, the team
shouldn't be going anywhere.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.920
And if they do, those rich motherfuckers

23:07.011 --> 23:08.751
should be paying
for that shit themselves.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.928
Hey, if we lose, a deal still gets made.

23:11.015 --> 23:12.175
Right? The team still leaves

23:12.267 --> 23:13.848
and the stadium still gets built.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.179
SO it may as well
stay in the hands of friends, right?

23:16.354 --> 23:18.219
Oh, so you're saying we're friends now?

23:18.648 --> 23:20.013
Well, you just make sure my new friend

23:20.108 --> 23:21.473

23:30.159 --> 23:32.411

was talking about it.

23:32.579 --> 23:33.614
Yeah.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.536
Well, that's what you wanted.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.124
I thought it was what I wanted,

23:37.709 --> 23:39.870
but now that he's gone, it's so strange.

23:39.961 --> 23:42.623
Oh, baby,
but he was treating you like shit.

23:43.381 --> 23:44.791

about resigning from myjob.

24:04.402 --> 24:05.562
What do you think about that?

24:06.321 --> 24:08.778
Well, I think most people
have anotherjob

24:08.865 --> 24:10.196
before they quit theirjob.

24:10.992 --> 24:15.531
Yeah, but there's just no way
the new GM will keep me on.

24:15.913 --> 24:18.450
In his eyes,
I'll always be Siefert's boy.

24:18.541 --> 24:21.078
It's just that if I quit now,

24:21.169 --> 24:23.535
