39:49.788 --> 39:51.590
- FEEL.

39:51.590 --> 39:54.059
- WE SHOULD NOT PUT
ALL THAT WATER TO WASTE, NO?

39:54.059 --> 39:56.795
- NO?
- NO.

39:56.795 --> 39:57.829
- OW.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.131

39:59.131 --> 40:00.665
I-I--

40:00.665 --> 40:04.136

40:04.136 --> 40:06.938
I-I--
- YES!

40:06.938 --> 40:08.673
- I CAN'T.
- YES!

40:08.673 --> 40:10.976
- NO.
I CAN'T!

40:10.976 --> 40:12.844
- [moans]

40:12.844 --> 40:15.614
- I--NO, I CAN'T.
- YES!

40:15.614 --> 40:18.683
- OH, FUCK!
- YES! [moans]

40:29.961 --> 40:32.631
[indistinct conversation]

40:43.708 --> 40:45.577
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

40:45.577 --> 40:48.680
WHOSE ASS AM I KICKING FIRST?
- THERE'S NO ASS TO KICK.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.750
KEV'S A LITTLE BOY WITH
A "WHITE PICKET FENCE" FANTASY,

40:51.750 --> 40:54.219
AND IN WALKS HIS WIFE
WITH HIS SON.

40:54.219 --> 40:55.620
- WE DON'T KNOW
THAT'S HIS KID.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.689
SO FIRST THING WE DO
IS GET A PATERNITY TEST.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.191
- IT'S NOT ABOUT BLOOD
TO KEV.

40:59.191 --> 41:01.393
THERE'S A WOMAN
HE GREW UP WITH AND MARRIED

41:01.393 --> 41:03.562
SAYING HER SON IS HIS.

41:03.562 --> 41:06.198
- THAT'S STUPID.
- IT'S NOT. LOOK AT YOU.

41:06.198 --> 41:07.899
YOU'RE A MOTHER
TO YOUR KIDS.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.135
DOESN'T MATTER
YOU DIDN'T PUSH THEM OUT.

41:13.605 --> 41:16.374
KEV'S THE FIRST GOOD MAN
I'VE EVER LOVED, YOU KNOW?

41:16.374 --> 41:19.845
MY FIRST LOVE WAS
NAMED APOLLO, ENOUGH SAID.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.379
THEN THERE WAS SPIDER.

41:21.379 --> 41:22.714
- [laughs]
SPIDER?

41:22.714 --> 41:24.449
- YOU CAN'T MAKE
THAT SHIT UP.

41:27.552 --> 41:28.954
NO, I...

41:28.954 --> 41:31.857
I CAN'T FIGHT FOR KEV.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.692
ASKING HIM TO PICK ME
OVER THEM

41:33.692 --> 41:36.294
IS ASKING HIM TO CHANGE
THE THING ABOUT HIM

41:36.294 --> 41:39.397
THAT I LOVE THE MOST.

41:39.397 --> 41:40.866
- SCREW THAT.

41:40.866 --> 41:42.467
- FI...

41:42.467 --> 41:45.637
SCREW THAT.
- FIONA.

41:45.637 --> 41:49.441
SIT--FI!

41:49.441 --> 41:52.944
- GOOD CATCH.
- KEV!

41:52.944 --> 41:55.347
WHAT THE FUCK?
- THERE'S KIDS AROUND.

41:55.347 --> 41:57.349
- OH, YOU THINK
THEY HAVEN'T HEARD IT BEFORE?

41:57.349 --> 41:59.918
WHAT, ARE YOU DRUNK?
- NO, I'M NOT DRUNK.

41:59.918 --> 42:01.453
I'M OUT OF MY MIND,
'CAUSE YOU AND V

42:01.453 --> 42:03.188
ARE THE ONLY THINGS
THAT HAVE EVER MADE SENSE

42:03.188 --> 42:04.756
TO ME IN THIS
WHOLE FUCKED UP WORLD.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.258
OKAY, IF YOU GUYS
CAN'T MAKE IT,

42:06.258 --> 42:08.627
JIMMY AND I SHOULD
JUST QUIT RIGHT NOW.

42:08.627 --> 42:11.363
I SWEAR TO GOD,
IF YOU LEAVE V--

42:11.363 --> 42:13.231
- WHO'S LEAVING V?
- YOU'RE LEAVING V?

42:13.231 --> 42:14.900
- NO.
FIONA, WHAT THE HELL?

42:14.900 --> 42:17.302
- THE NOTARY, KEV,
THE DIVORCE PAPERS?

42:17.302 --> 42:18.637
- OH!

42:18.637 --> 42:20.672
SHIT. I HAD SOME DRINKS.

42:20.672 --> 42:23.475
AND CHERYL
DROPPED THIS KID BOMB, AND--

42:23.475 --> 42:25.677
AND I FORGOT.
- HEY!

42:25.677 --> 42:27.646
YOU'RE INTERRUPTING.
- EXCUSE ME?

42:27.646 --> 42:31.116
- KEV'S TRYING
TO GET TO KNOW HIS SON.

42:31.116 --> 42:35.120
GIVE MY BOYS THEIR TIME.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.355
- YOUR BOYS?
- FIONA, FIONA.

42:37.355 --> 42:38.857
IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

42:38.857 --> 42:41.760
LOOK, CHERYL AND I
HAVE HISTORY--THAT'S IT.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.628
AND SHE'S NOT TRYING
TO STEAL ME AWAY FROM V.

42:43.628 --> 42:46.431
SHE JUST WANTS ME
TO MEET MY SON.

42:49.267 --> 42:53.038
- I KNOW SCHOOL
WAS NEVER YOUR THING,

42:53.038 --> 42:54.506
BUT YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN DUMB.

42:54.506 --> 42:56.708
IF YOU DON'T SEE
WHAT HAPPENING HERE,

42:56.708 --> 42:59.077
JUST PLAIN DUMB.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.313
COME ON, DEBS, DINNERTIME.

43:01.313 --> 43:04.249
- CAN KYLE COME?
- NO.

43:06.851 --> 43:08.186
- ALL RIGHT.

43:08.186 --> 43:09.654
- YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER,

43:09.654 --> 43:11.856
SHE REMINDS ME VERY MUCH
OF YOUR FIONA--

43:11.856 --> 43:16.628
BEAUTIFUL, RAISED SIX KIDS,
NEVER COMPLAINED, A SAINT.

43:16.628 --> 43:20.031
MY FATHER, HE WAS A...

43:20.031 --> 43:21.700
[speaking Portuguese]

43:21.700 --> 43:24.836
A ROLLING STONE.
- SHE PUT MY HAND THERE.

43:24.836 --> 43:28.139
I DIDN'T EVEN MOVE IT.

43:28.139 --> 43:32.077
- THAT IS SOMETHING EXACTLY
LIKE MY FATHER WOULD HAVE SAID.

43:37.248 --> 43:38.817
- DID THAT FATTY
ACTUALLY COP A FEEL?

43:38.817 --> 43:40.352
- HE TOTALLY COPPED A FEEL.

43:40.352 --> 43:42.387
[laughs]
- YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

43:42.387 --> 43:44.823
I MEAN,
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

43:44.823 --> 43:47.926
- SHIT, MICKEY.
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING HERE?

43:47.926 --> 43:49.828
- AH, FROM THE STORE, RIGHT?

43:49.828 --> 43:52.063
OH, COME ON, IAN,
DON'T BE RUDE.

43:52.063 --> 43:53.698
INVITE YOUR BOYFRIEND
BACK TO MY PLACE.

43:53.698 --> 43:55.400
I MEAN, THE MORE
THE MERRIER, RIGHT?

43:55.400 --> 43:57.435
[chuckles]
- I'M SORRY.

43:57.435 --> 44:00.305
WHAT'D YOU CALL ME?
- WHAT?

44:00.305 --> 44:01.740
- OH, JESUS, MICKEY!

44:01.740 --> 44:03.041

44:03.041 --> 44:04.509
WHAT THE FUCK

44:04.509 --> 44:06.711
- ENOUGH. ENOUGH!

44:06.711 --> 44:09.314
[horn honking]

44:11.416 --> 44:12.717

44:12.717 --> 44:15.053
THEY'RE GONNA CALL THE COPS.

44:15.053 --> 44:17.589

- COME ON!

44:17.589 --> 44:19.491

I'LL TEXT YOU.

44:23.828 --> 44:25.363
AH, SHIT!

44:34.739 --> 44:37.075

44:37.075 --> 44:40.278

44:40.278 --> 44:43.915
[both laughing]

44:49.220 --> 44:51.489
- WHERE'D YOU LEARN THIS?

44:51.489 --> 44:54.426
- NOWHERE.
JUST RELAX AND ENJOY.

44:54.426 --> 44:56.094
- YOU BEEN WATCHING PORN
WITHOUT ME?

44:56.094 --> 44:57.729
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I CONSIDER THAT CHEATING.

44:57.729 --> 44:59.397
- NO, I HAVEN'T,

44:59.397 --> 45:01.399
ALTHOUGH I DO CONSIDER
THAT RULE PRETTY UNREALISTIC.

45:01.399 --> 45:04.202
I JUST THOUGHT IT UP.

45:04.202 --> 45:06.604
IT'S HOT, RIGHT?

45:06.604 --> 45:09.374
- MAYBE IF I WAS LICKING IT
OFF YOU.

45:09.374 --> 45:11.910
I'M HUNGRY.
TRADE PLACES.

45:11.910 --> 45:14.279
- NO.
- NO?

45:14.279 --> 45:18.583
[chuckles] SINCE WHEN
DO YOU TURN DOWN A B.J.?

45:18.583 --> 45:21.586
YOUR DICK'S

45:28.626 --> 45:31.629
- WHAT?
I DID A LITTLE MANSCAPING.

45:33.798 --> 45:35.667
SHIT.

45:35.667 --> 45:37.402
IT'S NOT MY FAULT, OKAY?

45:37.402 --> 45:40.205
WHAT--SHE'S A PEDOPHILE!

45:40.205 --> 45:43.208
LOOK, IT WAS
A STING OPERATION.

45:43.208 --> 45:45.143
LOOK, I TOOK A PICTURE

46:14.038 --> 46:15.607
- WHAT?
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

46:15.607 --> 46:17.208
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT IT'S COOL, RIGHT?

46:17.208 --> 46:19.444
- YEAH, IT'S AWESOME, CARL.

46:22.814 --> 46:25.650
[sighs]

46:31.456 --> 46:34.159
[door closes]

46:39.497 --> 46:43.568
- I'M GONNA KNOW MY KID.

46:43.568 --> 46:45.236
I'M GONNA KNOW MY KID,

46:45.236 --> 46:49.741
AND YOU CAN'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

46:49.741 --> 46:52.510
LOOK, I...

46:52.510 --> 46:55.013
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT CHERYL, V.

46:55.013 --> 46:59.250
I USED TO, BUT SHE'S NOTHING
BUT A MEMORY TO ME NOW.

46:59.250 --> 47:01.286
AND I'M SORRY...

47:01.286 --> 47:05.023
[sighs]
I DIDN'T GO SEE THE NOTARY.

47:05.023 --> 47:09.661
BUT I WOULD
NEVER LEAVE YOU, EVER.

47:09.661 --> 47:12.564
YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT.

47:15.033 --> 47:19.904
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

47:19.904 --> 47:23.741
YOU KIND OF JUST HAVE

47:55.273 --> 47:57.075
- CHERYL, WOULD YOU JUST

47:57.075 --> 47:58.743
- YOU COULD'VE HAD THIS,
AND YOU WANT THAT?

47:58.743 --> 48:00.345
SHE'S SOME KIND OF NYMPHO,

48:00.345 --> 48:01.813
