Twenty-five,
thirty thirty-five, forty

00:52.353 --> 00:55.287
forty-one, forty-two.

00:55.289 --> 00:58.123
Parkinson, make it 42.

00:58.125 --> 01:01.193
The noise in Times Square
deprives us

01:01.195 --> 01:03.862
of 42 percent of our hearing.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.649
Stop the phonograph player.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.752
Hm?

02:34.588 --> 02:37.122
<i>What are you listening to?</i>

02:37.124 --> 02:39.124
I'm not listening to anything.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.694
<i>Nothing?</i>

02:42.696 --> 02:46.198
Right.
These are for hearing nothing.

02:52.039 --> 02:55.541
So, how much longer
is this gonna take, man?

03:06.287 --> 03:10.088
Look, I thought
I was paying you to soundproof

03:10.090 --> 03:12.157
my apartment or something.

03:19.934 --> 03:22.267
It's a B-flat.

03:22.269 --> 03:25.637
<i>- What is?</i>
- Your heating unit.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.673
That's a shitty radiator.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.943
You do hear
the noise though, right?

03:30.945 --> 03:32.477
Your problem
is your heating unit.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.012
When paired
with the low tones produced

03:34.014 --> 03:37.282
by your kitchen appliances,
the note emitted

03:37.284 --> 03:39.117
from your radiator
is contributing

03:39.119 --> 03:43.488
to your... anxiety.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.661
<i>- Really?</i>
- Mm-hm.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.958
Call this number
next Tuesday afternoon

04:19.959 --> 04:21.959
if you have any other issues.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.366
<i>Hello, you've reached
the answering machine</i>

05:01.368 --> 05:03.235
<i>of Peter Lucian.</i>

05:03.237 --> 05:06.772
<i>If I've given you my number,
you've dialed it correctly</i>

05:06.774 --> 05:08.607
<i>but at the wrong time.</i>

05:08.609 --> 05:11.109
<i>Please briefly describe
your situation</i>

05:11.111 --> 05:12.844
<i>and leave a telephone number.</i>

05:15.149 --> 05:19.151
<i>Hey, Peter. This is
Brian Mosden, down in Tribeca.</i>

05:20.454 --> 05:22.087
<i>Listen..</i>

05:22.089 --> 05:24.256
<i>You know, I was
a little skeptical at first</i>

05:24.258 --> 05:29.261
<i>uh, but I honestly haven't
slept this well in months.</i>

05:29.263 --> 05:31.697
<i>Thank you for whatever you did
to my blender.</i>

05:33.400 --> 05:36.335
<i>Hi. I got your number
from my friend Alex.</i>

05:37.771 --> 05:40.605
<i>I'm looking to set up
an appointment for..</i>

05:41.875 --> 05:44.743
<i>Well, whatever you did for Alex.</i>

05:44.745 --> 05:47.312
<i>He and his girlfriend
are getting along</i>

05:47.314 --> 05:49.481
<i>great right now.</i>

05:49.483 --> 05:53.318
<i>My number is 6-4-6-2-4-0-0-0-8.</i>

05:57.758 --> 06:00.926
<i>The radiator is contributing
to your anxiety.</i>

06:02.262 --> 06:04.763
<i>You do hear
the noise though, right?</i>

06:07.701 --> 06:10.268
<i>It's a B-flat.</i>

06:10.270 --> 06:12.904
<i>- What is?
- Your heating unit.</i>

06:58.285 --> 07:01.119
Field test. Central Park.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.187
G Major.

08:08.455 --> 08:09.788
<i>You're punctual.</i>

08:11.325 --> 08:13.391
I'm actually early.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.529
- I guess you're Peter?
- I am.

08:17.531 --> 08:21.032
I'm Ellen.
Do you wanna go inside?

08:22.336 --> 08:24.236
Actually, I would prefer
to ask you some questions

08:24.238 --> 08:27.005
outside the apartment first
before we enter.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.441
Oh. Okay.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.109
<i>You wanna have a seat?</i>

08:35.182 --> 08:38.482
Uh, it's helpful for me
if I record this

08:38.485 --> 08:40.418
<i>if you don't mind.</i>

08:40.419 --> 08:41.852
Sure, that's fine.

08:41.855 --> 08:46.024
This is a lot more formal
than I expected.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.026
I... I've found
that when clients talk

08:48.028 --> 08:49.794
about their homes
when inside them

08:49.796 --> 08:52.998
they, they tend to speak less
directly about the issue.

08:54.768 --> 08:58.303
Right, it can be difficult
to talk about

08:58.305 --> 09:01.740
a relationship problem,
in this case, your apartment

09:01.742 --> 09:04.242
with the, the partner present.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.813
Never thought about it that way.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.684
So, to begin..

09:12.686 --> 09:15.420
You describe to me your person.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.423
My person?

09:18.425 --> 09:19.858
<i>Yourself.</i>

09:19.860 --> 09:23.094
Oh, like, um, say my name

09:23.096 --> 09:25.997
introduce myself,
like that kinda thing?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.799
As you wish.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.302
<i>Um, well,
my name is Ellen Chasen.</i>

09:30.304 --> 09:32.871
- I am from Ohio.
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>

09:32.873 --> 09:34.873
But now I live in New York.

09:36.977 --> 09:41.479
Perhaps, uh, you could describe
your issue to me now.

09:41.481 --> 09:44.816
I, um, I am always tired.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.353
Exhausted, actually.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.921
<i>By the time I get
to the office in the morning</i>

09:49.923 --> 09:52.257
<i>I'm tired again.</i>

09:53.560 --> 09:55.060
And where do you work?

09:55.062 --> 09:57.529
Um, I work at a non-profit

09:57.531 --> 10:00.532
um, for low-income families.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.667
It's in Midtown.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.803
- And do you walk to work?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

10:04.805 --> 10:06.571
<i>I get to help people every day</i>

10:06.573 --> 10:09.407
<i>so, watching them</i>

10:09.409 --> 10:11.176
they, they get
to start their lives over

10:11.178 --> 10:13.211
I get to see that.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.646
<i>- It's nice.</i>
- No, no.

10:14.648 --> 10:18.683
I, I asked,
"Do you walk to work?"

10:18.685 --> 10:20.585
Oh, uh, sorry.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.188
Um... no.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.190
It would be, like, 40 blocks.

10:38.505 --> 10:42.273
I'll need an extended period
of time in each room.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.610
Specifically, kitchen,
bathroom, bedroom.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.979
- Yeah, it's no problem.
- Mm-hm.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.415
Can I get you some water
or anything?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.050
Actually,
I need it just like this.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.652
No additional sounds.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.488
- No additional appliances.
- Oh.

10:59.826 --> 11:00.892
No, thank you.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.480
Kitchen.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.095
Faucet.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.704
<i>Faucet and blender.</i>

11:55.382 --> 11:56.715
<i>Refrigerator.</i>

11:57.784 --> 11:59.784
<i>Three hundred and ninety.</i>

12:24.077 --> 12:25.110
<i>Hillary.</i>

12:25.112 --> 12:26.311
<i>We're right around the corner.</i>

12:26.313 --> 12:28.146
Hi, yeah, sorry,
I... I can't talk

12:28.148 --> 12:30.081
'cause I have, uh,
company right now.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.282
<i>Do you have
a man over there with you?</i>

12:31.284 --> 12:33.017
No, that's not why.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.355
<i>Yeah. Okay, I'll see you later.</i>

12:37.357 --> 12:39.357
Okay. Bye.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.393
Sorry.

12:49.402 --> 12:52.504
So, at this point, I'll need
to go into your bedroom

12:52.506 --> 12:55.006
if that's alright
with you, Ellen. Yeah?

12:55.008 --> 12:56.775
I typically save
this visit for last

12:56.777 --> 13:00.545
since it is the most personal,
but hopefully, you feel

13:00.547 --> 13:03.448
a little more comfortable
with me by now?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.617
Of course. By all means.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.987
Can I watch?

13:11.792 --> 13:12.891
Mm.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.994
Mind if I lie down?

13:17.197 --> 13:19.531
Is that typical?

13:19.533 --> 13:21.332
You mentioned over the phone
that you're having trouble

13:21.334 --> 13:22.700
sleeping at night.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.369
- Is that right?
- Yes.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.318
It helps me if I recreate
your morning routine

13:40.320 --> 13:42.320
as closely as possible.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.457
Would you say
you're a side sleeper?

13:46.459 --> 13:48.126
<i>- No.</i>
- No.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.737
<i>I'll have to review
my materials to be certain</i>

13:59.739 --> 14:02.707
but I think your problem
is in the kitchen.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.876
Do you eat bagels every morning?

14:06.112 --> 14:08.880
Uh... uh, no.

14:08.882 --> 14:12.417
S... sometimes,
but usually toast.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.319
- Mm-hm.
- With some fruit.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.689
Okay. I think you need
a new toaster.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.425
That should do it.

14:29.135 --> 14:32.570
<i>I noticed your toaster
produces an E-flat.</i>

14:32.572 --> 14:36.507
And your refrigerator
hums at a clear G.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.910
Now, the foundation note

14:38.912 --> 14:40.411
is a subtle but convincing C

14:40.413 --> 14:42.647
throughout the entire apartment.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.681
Here.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.895
You hear that? Hm?

14:56.897 --> 14:59.430
That mechanical sound?

14:59.432 --> 15:03.735
Or, uh, perhaps
it's... it's wind patterns

15:03.737 --> 15:05.403
on the East Side.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.141
It's remarkably consistent.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.780
Well... anyway

15:15.782 --> 15:18.383
a new toaster should
solve your problems.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.485
You really think
it's that simple?

15:20.487 --> 15:23.521
Technically, your refrigerator
is a perfect fifth.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.157
And the minor third created
by your toaster

15:26.159 --> 15:30.161
combined with the tonic
from your neighborhood

15:30.163 --> 15:33.164
and, uh, you've got
a depression.

15:35.235 --> 15:39.170
So, I'll have a new model
sent over. Soon.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.506
But we should talk
in the next few days.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.774
Yes, of course.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.810
Alright.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.665
He loves this old shit.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.834
<i>- I think it's nice.</i>
- It is nice.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.637
Everything in here
is really nice.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.238
<i>Hm.</i>

17:54.240 --> 17:56.107
Maybe I should just
move to Brooklyn.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.476
<i>- Wanna swap apartments?</i>
- Don't yell.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.877
- Cleo's still napping.
<i>- Sorry.</i>

17:59.879 --> 18:03.414
I know, it's nice, it's great.

18:03.416 --> 18:08.152
But sometimes it's a little
weird living there.

18:08.154 --> 18:10.788
Apartment's a little big.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.825
And I still get Patrick's mail.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.159
<i>I hate that.</i>

18:17.097 --> 18:21.199
Anyway, it's cheap.
So, why should I leave?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.967
Right.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.303
Here's to rent-stabilized
apartments.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.572
- Shit!
- Oh, here, let me get you a...

18:27.574 --> 18:28.806
- No, it's okay.
- Let me get you a...

18:28.808 --> 18:30.641
I'll... I'll... I'll grab
a towel.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.111
There's some towels
on the counter there.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.912
Okay.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.122
Why is everything unplugged?

18:44.124 --> 18:45.556
<i>- Oh.
- Yeah.</i>

18:45.558 --> 18:48.292
<i>- That's Landon's latest phobia.
- Phobia?</i>

18:48.294 --> 18:50.128
<i>He's afraid the apartment
will catch fire</i>

18:50.130 --> 18:51.863
when we're not at home.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.631
Or when we're asleep.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.533
Or when we're eating dinner.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.668
- Or when we're having sex.
- Okay.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.303
It's not a phobia,
it's a safeguard.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.339
So, you just leave it
all unplugged?

19:01.341 --> 19:02.773
<i>Spontaneous electrical fires</i>

19:02.775 --> 19:04.909
are way more common
than you think, okay?

19:04.911 --> 19:05.910
Especially in cities.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.912
<i>I read about them all the time.</i>

19:07.914 --> 19:09.547
It's his OCD.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.182
So, where are you
reading about this?

19:11.184 --> 19:12.316
<i>The internet.</i>

19:12.318 --> 19:14.986
So, how'd it go
with that house tuner

19:14.988 --> 19:16.787
we set you up with anyway?

19:16.789 --> 19:18.689
- And Landon loves that guy.
- I love that guy.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.726
Yeah, it was, um,
it was a little weird.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.427
- Weird how?
- Why? Is he a creep?

19:23.429 --> 19:26.030
No, no, no, no.
Not creepy at all. At all.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.132
Although, he did lay on my bed.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.768
- That sounds creepy.
- But not in a creepy way.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.436
Not.. He's not a creep.

19:32.438 --> 19:36.741
He was actually very polite,
and very professional.

19:36.743 --> 19:41.078
He told me that, um,
I need to get a new toaster.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.047
- What?
- Why is that so funny?

19:43.049 --> 19:44.982
Maybe that... maybe that's
helpful.

19:44.984 --> 19:49.353
It sounds ridiculous,
but he was talking to me about

19:49.355 --> 19:51.122
the tonic of my neighborhood

19:51.124 --> 19:54.959
and how my refrigerator
is contributing

19:54.961 --> 19:57.662
to this oppressive chord.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.230
- Yeah.
<i>- What?</i>

19:59.232 --> 20:01.732
Yeah, that's his thing. Right?

20:01.734 --> 20:03.968
Here, look. This is
from "Talk Of The Town."

20:03.970 --> 20:07.505
"According to Peter Lucian,
the silence is full of sound

20:07.507 --> 20:09.207
"as his practice offers
solutions

20:09.209 --> 20:11.442
"for depression,
anxiety, fatigue

20:11.444 --> 20:14.045
<i>"all of which are triggered
by the sonic details</i>

20:14.047 --> 20:16.414
"of our homes, he explains.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.549
"After an impromptu tour
of the converted.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.452
Cold War-era fallout shelter
he calls home.."

20:21.454 --> 20:22.887
This guy's so fucking cool.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.755
"Lucian points out
the meticulous labels

20:24.757 --> 20:25.990
<i>"attached to each appliance</i>

20:27.727 --> 20:29.727
Weird, but kind of sexy.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.263
- Is he single?
- Are you serious?

20:32.265 --> 20:34.432
Only you would find that sexy,
by the way.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.268
So, what do you think?
You gonna give it a whirl?

20:37.270 --> 20:39.937
I'm fine. Really.

20:39.939 --> 20:44.575
I mean, I think all this therapy
is just too much.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.277
- It's not for me.
<i>- Really?</i>

20:46.279 --> 20:49.347
I just need to find a
way to get some rest.

20:49.349 --> 20:52.183
When Landon was training
for his marathon last fall

20:52.185 --> 20:55.519
he found a great acupuncture
place in Greenpoint.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.189
That was for my IT band.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.557
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.459
So, maybe it's worth taking
a look at.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.294
<i>But that's..
Those are different things.</i>

21:03.296 --> 21:04.729
Yeah, but acupuncture.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.606
Do you think it's a problem?

23:31.277 --> 23:33.277
I'll see what I can do.

23:35.181 --> 23:38.449
Uh, go on. Robert is waiting
for you in the study.

23:44.624 --> 23:48.559
<i>My data is supported. Maybe
they just can't comprehend it.</i>

23:48.561 --> 23:50.027
It's all good feedback, Peter.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.863
I encourage my students
to ask tough questions

23:52.865 --> 23:55.566
in the critique sessions.

23:55.568 --> 23:58.102
<i>I think they're maybe caught up
a little bit in your..</i>

23:59.205 --> 24:01.639
In your lack of formalities.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.374
But I'm close, though.

24:03.376 --> 24:05.709
And you understand
the significance.

24:05.711 --> 24:07.311
Listen, I've read it.

24:07.313 --> 24:11.115
Don't rush yourself.
This work takes time. Years.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.850
Well, it's been years.

24:14.253 --> 24:16.320
This is a universal law
that I've discovered

24:16.322 --> 24:18.989
and the scientific community
needs to know about it.

24:20.259 --> 24:21.459
You know, there's a trap
in science

24:21.461 --> 24:23.427
that I talk
to my students about.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.629
One always sees exactly
what one's looking for

24:25.631 --> 24:28.332
not because it's there

24:28.334 --> 24:30.768
but because one desperately
wants to believe

24:30.770 --> 24:32.336
that it's there.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.872
Are you saying my research
is faulty?

24:34.874 --> 24:37.074
No!

24:37.076 --> 24:39.276
I'm just cautioning you not
to make it too personal

24:39.278 --> 24:40.744
perhaps even obsessive.

24:40.746 --> 24:44.081
One must be obsessive
in this field of ours

24:44.083 --> 24:48.619
but we have to be careful
of too much, um

24:48.621 --> 24:52.289
faith... in our own ideas.

24:52.291 --> 24:55.392
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

24:55.394 --> 24:58.929
Peter, this is Samuel Diaz,
my TA.

24:58.931 --> 25:01.131
I'm advising him on his thesis.

25:01.133 --> 25:04.568
So, are you still thinking
of leaving academia?

25:04.570 --> 25:05.936
- Formally, yes.
- Mm-hm.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.339
Uh, I need to get
my student loans paid off.

25:08.341 --> 25:09.840
Mm-hm.

25:14.881 --> 25:17.548
<i>I thought your research
was really fascinating.</i>

25:19.018 --> 25:21.185
- Me?
<i>- Yes.</i>

25:23.155 --> 25:24.722
Thank you.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.925
They pick everything apart.

25:27.927 --> 25:31.095
Anyone without a Ph.D.
gets run through the gauntlet.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.265
I could, if you'd like

25:34.267 --> 25:36.233
uh, refer you
to some standard guidelines

25:36.235 --> 25:40.304
for formatting and publishing.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.106
<i>Or perhaps Peter could be
a person to talk to</i>

25:42.108 --> 25:46.644
about that lab position
that, uh, you're after.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.221
<i>"Welcome back
to "The New American Journal</i>

25:57.223 --> 25:58.756
<i>of Sound Radio Hour."</i>

25:58.758 --> 26:01.892
<i>I'm your host,
Dr. Elizabeth Brookings.</i>

26:01.894 --> 26:04.828
<i>On today's show, we're
discussing the feature story</i>

26:04.830 --> 26:09.533
<i>from our latest issue
about new findings concerning</i>

26:09.535 --> 26:11.535
<i>the "Windsor Hum."</i>

26:36.629 --> 26:37.962
<i>And how does this all relate</i>

26:37.964 --> 26:40.297
<i>to the apartment tunings
you conduct?</i>

26:42.468 --> 26:44.969
Are you familiar with
the concept of a macro-scope?

26:46.639 --> 26:48.639
You mean a very big microscope?

26:49.809 --> 26:52.343
Um, it's a way of seeing things
that are larger

26:52.345 --> 26:55.112
so, in this case,
it's a way of seeing patterns.

26:56.382 --> 26:59.383
Once the predominant harmonies
are determined..

27:00.319 --> 27:02.753
They're translated here.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.756
So, all of this, in a sense,
is a macro-scope.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.493
Typically..

27:09.495 --> 27:12.563
I know the solution
to a client's issues

27:12.565 --> 27:14.298
before I even arrive.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.735
And it always works?

27:20.640 --> 27:23.807
D, F, A.

27:25.378 --> 27:27.478
D minor.

27:27.480 --> 27:31.315
- That's amazing.
- You read music?

27:31.317 --> 27:34.218
I took piano lessons
when I was a kid.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.320
- You did?
- Uh-huh.

27:38.524 --> 27:41.191
How's your pitch? Sam?

27:42.461 --> 27:44.128
How's your pitch?

27:44.797 --> 27:45.829
Decent.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.297
Uh, my graduate work was

27:47.299 --> 27:50.601
on, uh, cochlear neurons
in mice.

27:50.603 --> 27:52.269
I love the ear.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.774
Mm..

28:21.801 --> 28:25.002
<i>You've reached the answering
machine of Peter Lucian.</i>

28:25.004 --> 28:28.172
<i>If I've given you my number,
you've dialed it correctly</i>

28:28.174 --> 28:29.940
<i>but at the wrong time.</i>

28:29.942 --> 28:32.643
<i>Please briefly describe
your situation</i>

28:32.645 --> 28:34.178
<i>and leave a telephone number.</i>

28:36.215 --> 28:37.448
<i>Hey, Peter.</i>

28:37.450 --> 28:41.618
<i>Uh, it's Ellen Chasen.</i>

28:42.955 --> 28:45.456
I know, I know we didn't have
a call scheduled.

28:46.992 --> 28:48.659
I'm not sure how this works.

28:48.661 --> 28:52.763
I guess, maybe you call me back,
or, um,

28:52.765 --> 28:56.266
thank you for, for coming over.

28:56.268 --> 29:00.437
Uh, God, this, this probably
sounds so strange.

29:00.439 --> 29:04.241
I don't want you to think
that I'm calling you

29:04.243 --> 29:07.578
because I'm crazy
or lonely, or..

29:08.748 --> 29:10.514
I got the toaster.

29:10.516 --> 29:14.518
Um, and I... I'm just wondering

29:14.520 --> 29:17.154
if there's anything else

29:17.156 --> 29:19.156
I could be doing, you know?

29:20.993 --> 29:22.526
<i>And when I can expect</i>

29:22.528 --> 29:25.095
<i>the prescription to work, or..</i>

29:26.832 --> 29:28.599
<i>I'll see a change.</i>

29:32.171 --> 29:33.837
<i>Okay, thanks. Bye.</i>

30:10.209 --> 30:13.210
<i>Anyway, a new toaster
should solve your problems.</i>

30:15.181 --> 30:17.748
<i>You really think
it's that simple?</i>

30:19.652 --> 30:23.086
<i>Your refrigerator hums
in a clear G.</i>

30:23.088 --> 30:24.521
<i>Now, the foundation of..</i>

30:27.927 --> 30:32.529
<i>Have you remodeled recently?
Put in any major changes?</i>

30:32.531 --> 30:35.499
<i>Uh, no, just minor stuff.</i>

30:35.501 --> 30:39.203
<i>I mean, no, uh,
new coats of paint</i>

30:39.205 --> 30:42.339
<i>or, um, redecorating
or anything like that</i>

30:42.341 --> 30:44.474
<i>if that's what you mean.</i>

30:44.476 --> 30:45.809
<i>That's what I mean.</i>

30:48.514 --> 30:50.514
<i>How would you describe
your place?</i>

30:51.250 --> 30:52.683
<i>My place?</i>

30:52.685 --> 30:54.351
<i>Yeah, your apartment.</i>

30:57.389 --> 30:59.389
<i>Perhaps we should go
upstairs now.</i>

31:05.531 --> 31:07.664
<i>Field test recordings.</i>

31:07.666 --> 31:09.666

<i>Desert air.</i>

32:40.759 --> 32:42.426
Oops. He-he!

32:50.235 --> 32:52.736
And you must be the house tuner.

32:54.573 --> 32:57.207
- Peter.
- Har... Harold Carlyle.

32:57.209 --> 33:01.144
Uh, we're really glad you
finally accepted our invitation.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.813
Your assistant mentioned
potential for financing

33:02.815 --> 33:03.981
my research.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.549
Of course, of course.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.250
The... the recent
"New Yorker" article

33:07.252 --> 33:09.252
really piqued my interest.

33:13.392 --> 33:17.160
So, uh, my assistant pulled
materials

33:17.162 --> 33:18.962
for our meeting.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.831
And it turns out,
we've actually used

33:20.833 --> 33:22.733
some of your designs.

33:22.735 --> 33:24.301
How do you mean?

33:24.303 --> 33:26.636
Well, the Echo Decay Timer.

33:26.638 --> 33:29.473
I understand, at least I heard

33:29.475 --> 33:31.908
it was born
in the basement of the Met.

33:33.579 --> 33:37.080
Well, I had a position
in the Preservation Department.

33:37.082 --> 33:39.116
Was maintaining period
instruments

33:39.118 --> 33:40.283
for musical performances

33:40.285 --> 33:44.788
to be historically accurate,
and..

33:44.790 --> 33:47.624
<i>I mean, we've significantly
upgraded the device</i>

33:47.626 --> 33:52.262
in the last decade,
but the EDT-1 was..

33:52.264 --> 33:54.931
It was a cornerstone
for concert recording.

33:56.502 --> 34:00.037
It was never intended
for that purpose, so..

34:00.039 --> 34:02.372
Oh. Well, excuse me. I, um..

34:03.809 --> 34:06.410
What was it for, then?

34:06.412 --> 34:09.446
I was studying
harmonic resonance.

34:09.447 --> 34:12.114
And the manufacturer
retained my patent

34:12.117 --> 34:15.118
in exchange
for custom fabrication.

34:15.120 --> 34:18.755
But I never wanted it
to be marketed for the public.

34:18.757 --> 34:23.360
Well, it was
a revolutionary product.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.393
Tool.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.563
"Tool." Of course.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.902
I no longer engage
with outside fabricators.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.637
<i>Well, our clients</i>

34:33.639 --> 34:36.039
are Fortune 500 creatures.

34:36.041 --> 34:39.042
You're more of a provider
for houses, right?

34:40.344 --> 34:42.212
Homes.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.214
"Bespoke domesticity."

34:45.717 --> 34:48.185
That's what friends
of mine call it.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.887
<i>But really, that's what
we're interested in.</i>

34:50.889 --> 34:52.389
<i>The market is changing,
and we want</i>

34:52.391 --> 34:54.491
<i>to cater our products</i>

34:54.493 --> 34:57.160
<i>to our customer's private lives.</i>

35:00.966 --> 35:03.967
I... I'm offering you
an opportunity, Peter.

35:20.619 --> 35:25.522
Uh... how is
Equilibrium delivered?

35:25.524 --> 35:30.293
Well, it's wall colors,
fragrances, soundscapes.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.095
And our technologies
allow our specialists

35:32.097 --> 35:34.764
to survey
entire homes virtually.

35:37.369 --> 35:38.468
Virtually?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.303
<i>Well, I mean, it's, uh,
currently just</i>

35:40.305 --> 35:43.974
a web chat,
but, honestly, you know..

35:45.444 --> 35:47.310
The virtual component
isn't bulletproof

35:47.312 --> 35:49.346
but the clients love it.

35:51.150 --> 35:54.317
Our technologies, and our muscle

35:55.320 --> 35:57.454
could give you a chance

35:57.456 --> 36:02.192
to create an entire atmosphere.

36:02.194 --> 36:06.029
<i>Yes, I... imagine the ability
to influence like that.</i>

36:09.168 --> 36:12.469
I think that I've had
a very positive influence

36:12.471 --> 36:14.538
on the lives of my clients.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.620
We bought the matching set
when we moved in.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.024
I thought you lived alone.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.659
I do. I... I do, yeah.

36:35.661 --> 36:39.095
This is a very long time ago.

36:39.097 --> 36:40.797
Mm-hm.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.699
Didn't think it mattered.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.034
It shouldn't.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.671
So, you've been
using this every morning?

36:47.673 --> 36:48.738
Every morning.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.811
You've got a problem here.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.648
What do you mean?

36:58.650 --> 37:02.152
Mm, your feelings continue?

37:03.322 --> 37:06.423
Yes, my, um,
my feelings continue.

37:14.032 --> 37:17.601
Perhaps I should visit
your work.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.336
Really?

37:19.338 --> 37:20.870
To understand what you're doing
that might be

37:20.872 --> 37:22.872
conflicting with the results.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.977
Does anyone have to be there?

37:26.979 --> 37:29.613
Well, ideally it would be
in the morning.

37:29.615 --> 37:32.482
But I could visit
in the afternoon

37:32.484 --> 37:34.818
then try to replicate
a morning scenario.

37:36.021 --> 37:39.155
It's just,
it's a very unusual thing

37:39.157 --> 37:40.290
to have to explain.

37:40.292 --> 37:43.260
You know, I... I... I like
to keep things

37:43.262 --> 37:44.461
at my job kind of...

37:44.463 --> 37:46.796
Discreet. I understand.

37:51.270 --> 37:55.639
Um, maybe I could come by
next week?

37:59.011 --> 38:00.644
Okay.

38:32.944 --> 38:34.778
What does red mean?

38:34.780 --> 38:36.913
It's just an anomaly.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.948
Does it affect the research?

38:38.950 --> 38:40.283
Of course not.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.952
Good.

38:42.954 --> 38:45.255
Because I already notified
"The Journal"

38:45.257 --> 38:47.257
to expect your submission.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.694
Can I help you with that?

38:51.763 --> 38:52.796
No.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.772
You know, I was actually
thinking that I could process

39:02.774 --> 39:06.543
the tapes a lot faster
with the university servers.

39:06.545 --> 39:10.046
Uh, our computers there
are very efficient.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.981
Well, everything here
works just fine.

39:11.983 --> 39:15.719
Yes, but it would

39:15.721 --> 39:18.221
help speed up the workflow

39:18.223 --> 39:19.923
and save me a lot of time

39:19.925 --> 39:22.425
because obviously,
I'm still looking

39:22.427 --> 39:25.595
for a full-time position
elsewhere.

39:43.248 --> 39:45.048
<i>Beyond publishing,
I... I think there'll be</i>

39:45.050 --> 39:47.350
<i>a lot of other applications.</i>

39:47.352 --> 39:51.287
You know, once people
understand the patterns

39:51.289 --> 39:54.557
and, uh, the influences

39:54.559 --> 39:56.393
you can do so much with this.

40:02.768 --> 40:06.436
- How do you mean?
- I don't know.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.805
Well, I... I..

40:08.807 --> 40:12.275
Well, I guess, urban design,
architecture

40:12.277 --> 40:13.943
home products.

40:17.416 --> 40:20.216
This is about
universal constants

40:20.218 --> 40:21.885
not commerce.

40:25.357 --> 40:27.023
I... I'm sorry. I just..

40:35.233 --> 40:37.667
- Stick out your tongue.
- My tongue? Really?

40:37.669 --> 40:40.336
I can see things on your tongue
that can help me.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.080
Do you exercise regularly?

40:53.151 --> 40:54.484
Sometimes.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.753
Okay.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.491
You can go to the Blue Room now.

41:01.493 --> 41:05.495
Uh, yeah, where should... where
should I change?

41:44.402 --> 41:47.270
How long do I have
to keep these in for?

41:47.272 --> 41:49.305
The feeling is deep

41:49.307 --> 41:50.974
but the needles are not.

41:52.544 --> 41:54.310
Okay, but..

41:54.312 --> 41:56.479
Thirty, sometimes sixty minutes.

44:36.908 --> 44:39.742
<i>Please select an atmosphere
for your ride.</i>

44:42.480 --> 44:44.147
<i>Ocean Breeze.</i>

44:46.017 --> 44:48.618
<i>Budget surplus over 130K.</i>

44:48.620 --> 44:50.787
<i>That's really great, you guys..</i>

44:50.789 --> 44:53.222
<i>The bad news is,
we still have to tend</i>

44:53.224 --> 44:54.857
<i>with the mayor's office.</i>

44:54.859 --> 44:56.859
<i>I know, I know. It is bullshit..</i>

44:58.596 --> 45:00.763
Feel free to have a seat.

45:00.765 --> 45:02.765
Ellen's just wrapping up.

46:05.497 --> 46:09.699
Sorry. I'm a little late.
My meeting went long.

46:16.708 --> 46:19.041
Is everything okay?

46:19.043 --> 46:22.378
<i>Honestly, I don't normally
work in offices.</i>

46:23.548 --> 46:25.715
There's just so much..

46:34.893 --> 46:37.226
So, I think I got a good sense
of this space.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.000
Um, well, you know, I..

46:44.002 --> 46:47.036
I actually cleared my afternoon

46:47.038 --> 46:49.672
so, maybe we can, uh,
go somewhere

46:49.674 --> 46:52.175
and... and discuss this further?

46:54.012 --> 46:56.679
Yeah, well,
I know some place close.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.699
More hot water, Peter?

47:16.701 --> 47:19.035
Ah, yes. Certainly.

47:21.339 --> 47:22.672
Thank you, Albert.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.541
Yes, thank you.

47:30.281 --> 47:33.282
You've really constructed
a unique little world

47:33.284 --> 47:35.618
for yourself
in the city, haven't you?

47:39.390 --> 47:42.124
I've lived here
for over a decade

47:42.126 --> 47:43.960
and I don't know

47:43.962 --> 47:46.195
I still feel
like there's so much

47:46.197 --> 47:47.964
that's unfamiliar to me.

47:47.966 --> 47:51.767
Like, someone else built it up.

47:55.940 --> 47:58.608
He was very organized
about things.

48:00.678 --> 48:02.345
The matching nightstands.

48:04.616 --> 48:07.083
<i>He always had an idea
or an opinion</i>

48:07.085 --> 48:08.417
about everything.

48:09.654 --> 48:11.921
It was nice, you know?

48:11.923 --> 48:14.190
To not have to make choices
for myself.

48:17.662 --> 48:19.328
It sounds silly, but..

48:20.698 --> 48:23.032
I remember after he was gone..

48:24.569 --> 48:27.904
The remote felt so odd
in my hand, like..

48:29.340 --> 48:32.675
I didn't know what
any of the buttons were for.

48:36.314 --> 48:38.547
Sorry, that's probably
way too personal.

48:40.184 --> 48:41.517
It's fine.

48:44.422 --> 48:45.755
What about you?

48:51.996 --> 48:54.497
I'm very consumed with my work.

48:54.499 --> 48:58.234
Actually, I'm, I'm publishing
a piece on human behavior..

48:59.370 --> 49:00.569
How sound influences

49:00.571 --> 49:02.571
the way that people connect
with each other.

49:08.212 --> 49:11.814
Well, I mean, you obviously
have a, a calling.

49:11.816 --> 49:14.083
You know, just to see you study

49:14.085 --> 49:16.986
and observe,
the way that you do.

49:19.590 --> 49:21.590
I'm a little envious, honestly.

49:23.861 --> 49:26.128
Did you study science?

49:26.130 --> 49:27.163
No.

49:29.167 --> 49:30.499
Music Theory.

49:31.769 --> 49:33.869
So, I learned by dissection

49:33.871 --> 49:36.172
how a piece of music works,
what are its parts.

49:36.174 --> 49:39.041
You know Bach,
the composer Bach?

49:39.043 --> 49:41.177
His ability to trick our ears

49:41.179 --> 49:43.179
into believing
that we're hearing

49:43.181 --> 49:44.747
multiple instruments
from a single violin.

49:44.749 --> 49:49.118
Or Stravinsky... and his
dissonance

49:49.120 --> 49:51.854
designed to alienate an audience

49:51.856 --> 49:55.124
or, or Beethoven,
this use of suspense

49:55.126 --> 49:59.095
and... delayed gratification.

49:59.097 --> 50:02.598
But all of these composers were
using neurological techniques

50:02.600 --> 50:05.601
that scientists
hadn't even defined yet.

50:07.138 --> 50:11.140
And once I understood that
and, um..

50:12.343 --> 50:14.944
How their music functioned

50:14.946 --> 50:17.613
um, I guess I just went on
from there.

50:20.284 --> 50:22.251
To tuning people's apartments?

50:24.255 --> 50:26.288
Yes. Yes, but no.

50:26.290 --> 50:28.858
I.. It's, um..

50:29.660 --> 50:31.560
It's the influence of sound.

50:31.562 --> 50:34.263
The power it has
over people's lives..

50:35.500 --> 50:40.503
Hm... they may not even know it,
you know.

50:40.505 --> 50:44.507
Yeah, it's, um, so complex.

50:45.443 --> 50:48.511
- I'm intrigued.
- Hm.

50:51.482 --> 50:54.116
I have a very, very close friend

50:54.118 --> 50:55.951
who's a neuroscientist
at Columbia.

50:55.953 --> 50:58.888
And his students are reviewing
my findings next week

50:58.890 --> 51:00.923
in a group session.

51:00.925 --> 51:02.491
It's very informal.

51:02.493 --> 51:05.361
And if you're interested
in learning more, um..

51:07.365 --> 51:08.831
I don't know.

51:55.813 --> 51:58.981
<i>Battery Park City, F major.</i>

52:03.521 --> 52:05.221
<i>Complacency.</i>

52:32.016 --> 52:34.783
<i>So, how do you feel
in the morning?</i>

52:34.785 --> 52:38.821
<i>Um... unmotivated..</i>

52:38.823 --> 52:40.189
<i>Irritated.</i>

52:42.059 --> 52:44.193
<i>I thought you lived alone.</i>

52:44.195 --> 52:45.728
<i>I do. I... I do, yeah.</i>

52:45.730 --> 52:49.465
<i>This was a... very long
time ago.</i>

52:50.601 --> 52:52.501
<i>Didn't think it mattered.</i>

52:52.503 --> 52:53.636
<i>It shouldn't.</i>

52:58.976 --> 53:00.643
<i>Your feelings continue?</i>

53:00.645 --> 53:03.512
<i>Yes, my, um,
my feelings continue.</i>

53:42.720 --> 53:44.587
<i>Hello, you've reached
the answering machine</i>

53:44.589 --> 53:47.756
<i>of Peter Lucian.
If I've given you my..</i>

53:48.659 --> 53:49.692
Hello?

53:50.795 --> 53:52.294
Can I help you?

53:54.432 --> 53:56.098
No, he's not in right now.

53:56.100 --> 53:58.033
But I can take a message.

54:01.639 --> 54:04.373
Sensory Holdings, you said?

54:05.843 --> 54:07.943
Uh, I... I'm Sam.

54:09.513 --> 54:11.113
Yes, I work with him.

55:11.175 --> 55:12.941
<i>Are you Peter's colleague?</i>

55:12.943 --> 55:14.043
<i>- Ellen.
- Hi.</i>

55:14.045 --> 55:16.011
<i>- Hi.
- Upper East Side.</i>

55:16.013 --> 55:18.781
<i>C scale,
with an E flat toaster problem.</i>

55:18.783 --> 55:19.848
Oh.

55:20.951 --> 55:23.852
I'd like to think
I have better qualities

55:23.854 --> 55:26.121
than that to describe me.

55:30.861 --> 55:35.030
So, did Peter tune
your apartment?

55:35.032 --> 55:36.865
We're working on it.

55:36.867 --> 55:38.667
You mean it didn't work?

55:40.304 --> 55:43.138
Well, Ellen's entire soundscape

55:43.140 --> 55:46.475
points to a specific trigger
in her apartment.

55:46.477 --> 55:51.313
Um, but... there is,
there is distraction.

55:51.315 --> 55:55.551
So, I've had trouble locating
the specific trigger.

55:55.553 --> 55:57.286
Well, that's interesting.

55:57.288 --> 55:59.788
You make it sound
so complicated.

55:59.790 --> 56:00.956
- It is complicated.
- No, no.

56:00.958 --> 56:02.324
I think what your friend
is saying, Peter

56:02.326 --> 56:04.827
is that you make it sound
too complicated.

56:04.829 --> 56:08.497
But, however, knowing Peter, I'm
sure he could show you a diagram

56:08.499 --> 56:11.800
on the whole G major theory.

56:11.802 --> 56:14.002
- That's right.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

56:14.004 --> 56:16.238
- And you're welcome here. Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

56:16.240 --> 56:18.173
He told me
you two were old friends.

56:18.175 --> 56:21.944
She was, um, just interested
in seeing the group.

56:21.946 --> 56:24.713
- Oh.
- And my discovery.

56:24.715 --> 56:29.251
Oh, well, it'll be good to have
an outside perspective on this.

56:29.253 --> 56:31.720
- Mm-hm.
- Listen.

56:31.722 --> 56:34.790
Unfortunately,
we had to postpone your review

56:34.792 --> 56:37.059
until the next session.

56:37.061 --> 56:39.795
Um... I'm sorry.

56:42.400 --> 56:44.933
<i>In preparation
of Andrew's thesis defense</i>

56:44.935 --> 56:46.235
<i>we're gonna be workshopping..</i>

56:46.237 --> 56:49.571
Alright, this is me.
Wish me luck.

56:51.208 --> 56:53.108
- Should we, um..
- Yeah.

56:53.110 --> 56:55.244
Before I forget, there's
something I wanted to give you.

56:55.246 --> 56:56.445
Oh.

57:03.721 --> 57:05.554
It will help.

57:05.556 --> 57:07.055
It's something
I've been working on.

57:07.057 --> 57:09.625
So you just plug it
into an available outlet.

57:09.627 --> 57:11.427
It emits a wash.

57:11.429 --> 57:14.062
Uh, preferably one
that doesn't share a circuit

57:14.064 --> 57:16.432
with a microwave
or a hair dryer.

57:17.435 --> 57:18.867
Okay.

57:20.671 --> 57:22.271
- You want me to hold it?
- No, it's fine.

57:22.273 --> 57:24.540
I'll just stick it in my purse.

57:24.542 --> 57:29.845
So, I'm excited to hear more
about this G major theory.

57:29.847 --> 57:31.013
Hm.

57:33.150 --> 57:35.684
<i>And additional analysis
suggests that</i>

57:35.686 --> 57:37.886
<i>uh, incorrect analysis
of interactions</i>

57:37.888 --> 57:39.721
<i>are even more common.</i>

57:39.723 --> 57:43.325
<i>Your honors from Columbia
are very impressive.</i>

57:43.327 --> 57:45.160
<i>Thank you.</i>

57:45.162 --> 57:47.029
And your work with Peter Lucian

57:47.031 --> 57:50.232
did you accompany him
on his house calls?

57:50.234 --> 57:51.366
No.

57:52.636 --> 57:54.503
But we've been working
especially hard

57:54.505 --> 57:59.007
on consolidating his data
on the city as a whole.

57:59.009 --> 58:01.543
Samuel Diaz.

58:01.545 --> 58:04.446
It's a pleasure to meet you
in person.

58:04.448 --> 58:07.349
- I'm Harold.
- Very nice to meet you, Harold.

58:07.351 --> 58:09.885
Uh, you know, we're big admirers
of Peter here.

58:09.887 --> 58:11.920
We were actually just discussing
the new work

58:11.922 --> 58:13.155
he and Sam are doing.

58:13.157 --> 58:14.223
- Oh?
- Uh..

58:14.225 --> 58:16.525
- Well, it's Peter's discovery.
- Mm-hm.

58:16.527 --> 58:21.096
Uh, I assume he discussed the
urban sound patterns with you?

58:21.098 --> 58:24.099
Um, have there been any updates?

58:24.101 --> 58:25.601
Well, uh, yes, actually.

58:25.603 --> 58:28.303
It's... it's,
it's very, very exciting.

58:35.012 --> 58:37.212
My biggest client project
to date.

58:45.556 --> 58:50.025
So, these beams... reach
true ground.

58:50.027 --> 58:52.694
What's true ground?

58:52.696 --> 58:54.816
Oh, it means they reach
all the way down to the earth.

58:56.300 --> 58:57.833
It's a hard thing to come by
in New York City

58:57.835 --> 59:00.269
but we designed these so they'd
make contact with bedrock.

59:02.072 --> 59:03.539
And what's the point of that?

59:05.209 --> 59:09.478
Well... grounding current
is really the only way

59:09.480 --> 59:12.180
to achieve
true electrical silence.

59:14.518 --> 59:16.818
That sounds like a total luxury
in this city.

59:18.188 --> 59:21.523
Oh, well, the future tenant
is an electrophysiologist.

59:21.525 --> 59:24.526
And he takes true ground
and silence very seriously.

59:29.333 --> 59:32.267
- Sounds nice, true silence.
- Mm-hm.

59:32.937 --> 59:35.103
And so expensive.

59:35.105 --> 59:36.872
Well, I guess expense
is relative

59:36.874 --> 59:39.741
to perceived value... right?

59:39.743 --> 59:41.209
Please don't tell me
you're gonna make me

59:41.211 --> 59:42.644
ground my apartment.

59:42.646 --> 59:43.745
No.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.163
Look at all that.

01:00:01.165 --> 01:00:03.265
You see the order?

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:04.933
In the city?

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:08.470
Well, yeah.
I mean, the grid, right?

01:00:08.472 --> 01:00:10.305
And it... it's flawed at points

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:13.108
but there are all these
connections.

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:17.479
Light going from red to green.
Walk, don't walk.

01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:18.914
Instructions, right?

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:20.115
But what I've found..

01:00:21.352 --> 01:00:23.185
Is that there's something
deeper at work.

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:28.624
Um... an invisible system,
but powerful, nonetheless

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:32.327
sounds, that, in a sense

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:35.063
guide people through the city.

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:36.832
- Hm.
- Yeah?

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:39.668
I mean, they're not conscious
of it, but it's there.

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:43.338
And it's different
in all parts of the city.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.373
Hm.

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:50.679
In the Financial District,
it's the key of D minor.

01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:53.048
And it's frenetic,
it's fast-paced..

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:56.284
Reckless.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:03.325
And then, Lower East Side
is A flat

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:06.762
once you get,
um... below the dissonance.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:14.703
And Central Park
is predominantly G major.

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:16.605
<i>It's where I made
my first discovery.</i>

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:21.243
It's the sound of nostalgia.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:23.478
It's calm..

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.615
Idyllic, lyrical.

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:31.953
Field test 14,
Central Park, G major.

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:50.639
So, each part of the city
has a different chord?

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.875
Well, every part of the city

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:56.945
has its own instructive
atmosphere.

01:01:56.947 --> 01:02:00.549
It's impossible
to disconnect the sound

01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:02.684
from the collective state
of mind. It a..

01:02:04.188 --> 01:02:07.089
It affects the people.
You understand?

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:12.227
Oh, but I, I don't see
the world that way.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:15.497
I mean, it.. That's so rigid.

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:18.467
I mean, if I'm Downtown

01:02:18.469 --> 01:02:21.670
I'm not destined
to feel frenetic.

01:02:21.672 --> 01:02:26.341
I can choose to react to that
and feel peaceful.

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:28.643
I can choose to protect myself.

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:33.415
It's not about seeing anything.

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:37.018
It's... it's about acknowledging
what already exists.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:40.989
Like gravity, or light.
These are just universal laws.

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:42.257
- Right...
- And listen.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.893
These are, these are rules
that define our world.

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.797
Why does it have to be
this permanent thing

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:51.633
that controls us?

01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:55.337
Why... do people act the way
they do?

01:02:55.339 --> 01:02:57.572
Why do people feel the way
they do?

01:02:57.574 --> 01:03:00.742
- There's a reason.
- Because they're people.

01:03:00.744 --> 01:03:03.578
They can. They choose to feel.

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.615
But... but there are rules
guiding their behavior

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:08.750
that they can't see.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.553
There is an order here.

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:14.322
Now, it's complex
because we live in an old city.

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:17.325
And the patterns
are so complicated

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:21.496
but it's, it's been written
and rewritten

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:23.398
but it's there.
It's been there for years.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.069
I... I don't feel like my life
is written by anything.

01:03:28.071 --> 01:03:31.940
I feel like I make choices
all the time.

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:33.375
Uh-huh. Well, okay.

01:03:33.377 --> 01:03:36.745
Your apartment, C minor.
It's a mundane key.

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:41.750
It's... it's the sound
of resignation.

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:45.353
Okay, well,
I don't feel that way.

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:49.291
And that resignation
causes your restlessness.

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:53.328
And there are unseen forces
that are governing your choices.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:55.630
What about you?

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:58.099
You're the only person
who's not affected by any of it?

01:03:58.101 --> 01:04:00.202
I'm not immune. No one is.

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:02.904
Okay, so then,
how do you trust yourself?

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:04.906
Because I can hear it.

01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:08.910
Because you can hear it?

01:04:15.886 --> 01:04:18.854
I'm gonna go.
Just.. It's late, so..

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:46.648
The program of the
Noise Abatement Commission

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:50.352
consists of a series
of noise measurements

01:04:50.354 --> 01:04:53.488
to be made in different parts
of the city

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.824
at typical places..

01:04:55.826 --> 01:04:58.927
And centers of popular interest.

01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:02.631
Among these measurements

01:05:02.633 --> 01:05:07.502
will be made tests of the
deafening effect of the noise.

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:14.643
I hold the receiver
against the microphone

01:05:14.645 --> 01:05:17.178
instead of against my ear.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:20.515
Now, I increase the intensity
of the test tone

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:21.783
until you can hear it.

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:37.632
How much longer
is he gonna be here?

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:39.200
I have to get up early for work.

01:05:39.202 --> 01:05:40.936
I think he's almost done.

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:53.114
Hey, are you almost done?

01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:56.718
It's almost midnight.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.286
So, um..

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:02.958
That ringing..

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:08.196
Baby, come on.
Get him out of here.

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:11.666
I'm sorry, I just need to take
a few more readings

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:13.234
and I can handle the rest
in my office.

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:15.370
I just need one more minute.

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:16.671
One more minute.

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.640
You know what?

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:21.309
Don't worry about it,
we can figure it out from here.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.467
<i>Mr. Jajinsky.</i>

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:47.602
<i>Um, I couldn't access
your apartment.</i>

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:50.572
<i>FOR OUR 4:00 p.m. appointment.</i>

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:54.576
<i>Please call me to reschedule
at your earliest convenience.</i>

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:08.990
<i>If Sam showed Sensory my work</i>

01:07:08.992 --> 01:07:10.625
<i>then they have all of it.</i>

01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:13.128
- He wouldn't do that, Peter.
- Oh, fuck!

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:16.598
And you can't fault him
for taking a formal job.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.199
It's a good opportunity.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.935
They're my competition.
It's theft.

01:07:20.937 --> 01:07:24.172
I wouldn't paint it so starkly.
I mean..

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:28.309
They're marketers.
You're a explorer.

01:07:28.311 --> 01:07:30.478
Look, they can't take credit
for my discovery

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.780
if I publish it first.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:51.499
<i>We put so much emphasis on sound</i>

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:54.536
<i>and thus, overlook the value
of those moments</i>

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:56.137
<i>in between the noise.</i>

01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:02.410
And let this remind us
that silence is not empty

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.246
but immeasurably full.

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:31.707
Enjoy your evening.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:37.712
- Dr. Brookings.
- Hello.

01:08:39.683 --> 01:08:41.483
It's Peter Lucian.

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:43.785
Hi, nice to meet you.

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.353
Thank you so much for your talk.

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:48.689
It was fascinating. And for your
contributions to the field.

01:08:48.692 --> 01:08:50.258
You know, I've been reading
"The New American"

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.027
for just about as long
as you've had the editorship.

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:55.830
That's very kind. Um, thank you
so much for coming tonight.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:09:00.001
I'm sorry, but I really must go.
Uh, please enjoy your evening.

01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:01.769
Well, actually, um

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:05.840
I recently submitted a piece
for "The Journal."

01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:09.577
I know these things take time

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.546
but I just thought I would
inquire since I'm here.

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:13.348
What did you say your name was?

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.183
Peter Lucian.

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:19.220
Um... I made a discovery

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:21.788
identifying sound patterns
in the city.

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:26.094
And your work... was
just a huge inspiration for me.

01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:30.965
I, uh..

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:36.069
I honestly didn't think
we'd have a chance to talk.

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:37.604
Oh. Thank you.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:41.109
No, I didn't think
you were serious, Mr. Lucian.

01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:46.247
I must say, your methods
are, um, most unusual.

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:48.483
H... have you seriously
been researching these...

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.519
Sound patterns. Yes.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.556
They are principles
that steer our behavior.

01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:57.158
I mean,
it's... it's... it's verified.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.761
It's based off of
multiple field recordings.

01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:02.764
Oh, I'm sure you believe
in this.

01:10:05.068 --> 01:10:06.100
Listen..

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:10.271
Perhaps you could submit it
for peer review.

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:14.943
Yes, yes.
Uh, I'll tell you what.

01:10:14.945 --> 01:10:18.079
Um, we will, uh, give it
a closer look

01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:21.482
and we'll send you a proper,
uh, response letter.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.786
- Alright. Alright.
- Okay? Alright? Alright.

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:25.987
Pleasure meeting you.

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:28.423
- It's nice to meet you.
- Take care.

I... I just wanted to call you</i>

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:57.345
<i>and say sorry
for the way things ended.</i>

01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:01.582
<i>I've had some good weeks</i>

01:17:01.584 --> 01:17:06.354
<i>and I just wanted to tell you
that... you were right.</i>

01:17:06.356 --> 01:17:08.255
<i>You were right about this place.</i>

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:11.292
<i>I needed to change something.</i>

01:17:13.062 --> 01:17:16.330
<i>I just needed to get rid
of some old things..</i>

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:21.202
<i>Stop surrounding myself
with the past.</i>

01:17:21.204 --> 01:17:25.506
<i>I just decided to... be easy
about it.</i>

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:29.343
<i>You could do that, too, Peter.</i>

01:17:29.345 --> 01:17:30.845
<i>If you want.</i>

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:35.349
<i>I know it's your work to, uh</i>

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:37.284
<i>help people solve their problems</i>

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:42.023
<i>but the way that you see
the world around you..</i>

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:46.994
<i>I think that you miss out
on connecting yourself.</i>

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:55.136
<i>Actually... I'm so tired
of people telling me</i>

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:57.772
<i>what they think
I should be doing, so..</i>

01:18:00.243 --> 01:18:01.942
You do what you want.

01:20:55.985 --> 01:20:57.251
Here.

01:21:08.264 --> 01:21:09.797
I called you.

01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:15.636
I listened.

01:22:16.899 --> 01:22:18.599
Mm.
