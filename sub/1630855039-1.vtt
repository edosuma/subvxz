what you were doing

01:11:38.386 --> 01:11:40.039

was very young,

01:12:01.626 --> 01:12:07.153
Ishmael's scoffing towards him
became too much to bear.

01:12:07.197 --> 01:12:11.897
We had seen the same contention
in his mother years before.

01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:14.204
Eventually, the Lord had said
to send them away.
