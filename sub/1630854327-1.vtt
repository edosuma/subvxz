04:48.722 --> 04:50.991
I'm so sorry.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.360
Schmitt!

04:52.393 --> 04:54.395
You went gallivanting
around the world

04:54.428 --> 04:57.197
while your wife
threw a mountain of money

04:57.230 --> 04:58.932
at new surgical equipment.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.568
Then you opened up
the residency program

05:00.601 --> 05:03.070
six months
before you should have.

05:03.103 --> 05:07.074
You made a residency class
from the bottom of the barrel--

05:07.107 --> 05:08.342
the rejects.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.177
Yeah, that smacks
of desperation.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.179
I will not cosign.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.482
Well, look, they are
an excellent group, Bailey.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.784
They are a carefully
cultivated group.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.786
We got hundreds
of applications,

05:18.819 --> 05:21.154
and we combed through them
to find the gems.

05:21.188 --> 05:25.125
This class-- they may not have
gotten straight A's like you,

05:25.158 --> 05:27.395
but they have stories
and they have heart.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.996
They have empathy.

05:29.029 --> 05:32.132
And when you're trying to build
a solid surgeon,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.767
that counts for a lot.

05:33.801 --> 05:37.938
And I would highly recommend
gallivanting around the world.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.740
It changes your thinking.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.743
It just-- It opens up your--
your mind.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.412
You're telling me
I'm closed-minded?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.246
I-I did no such thing.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.981
Dr. Webber!

05:48.015 --> 05:50.618
I promised Jo Wilson that if she
got me a spot in OB-GYN,

05:50.651 --> 05:52.486
I would see
the residency through,

05:52.520 --> 05:55.188
no matter when the surgery
program opened back up.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.958
So, presently,
I'm risking not only my job,

05:57.991 --> 05:59.627
but also my friendship.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.229
That being said, I hate it.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.631
I hate it so much.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.534
You need
senior surgical residents.

06:06.567 --> 06:10.203
I-- I might so far as to say
you need a Chief Resident.

06:10.237 --> 06:13.073
And if you make me him,
I will be mean.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.975
I will be bossy.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.644
And if I'm ever tempted
to go soft,

06:16.677 --> 06:21.081
I will picture a return to OB,
and I will get stronger.

06:21.114 --> 06:24.685
Stronger like a vagina,
which I've been forced to learn

06:24.718 --> 06:28.088
can stretch to 200 times
its natural size

06:28.121 --> 06:30.958
and lift a 30 pound weight
just by flexing.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.127
I'll be the vagina...

06:34.161 --> 06:36.229
of the program
if you'd let me.

06:37.931 --> 06:43.571
Or, um, you might, um,
prefer the term backbone, sir.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.806
I wish you all
the best of luck.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.813
You'll need to speak
to Chief Grey, Schmitt.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.883
And, um,
I would suggest you...

06:55.916 --> 06:58.018
modify the--
the speech there.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.555
Yesterday's tornado
came out of nowhere

07:01.589 --> 07:03.290
and blew a bus off a cliff.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.959
The bus flipped over and landed
after a 20-foot drop,

07:05.993 --> 07:07.060
and because
many of the passengers

07:07.094 --> 07:08.462
were not wearing seatbelts,

07:08.496 --> 07:10.263
we have an inordinate number
of patients

07:10.297 --> 07:12.700

catastrophic brain injury.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.468
How do we declare
brain death?

07:14.502 --> 07:15.769
Dr. Kwan.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.070
Numerous criteria
must be met

07:17.104 --> 07:18.539
before determination
of brain death,

07:18.572 --> 07:20.273
including at least
two clinical exams

07:20.307 --> 07:22.309
and a confirmatory test
such as a brain scan.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.111
Correct.
How many are there?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.946
We raise our hands and we wait
to be called on, Dr. Adams.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.915

but it maintains

07:27.948 --> 07:31.785
a necessary pecking order
that keeps people alive.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.053
Dr. Adams.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.555
How many are potentially
brain-dead?

07:34.588 --> 07:36.356
14.
Whoa.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.025
Well, how many are donors?

07:40.928 --> 07:42.362
Dr. Griffith.
How many of those 14

07:42.395 --> 07:43.731

07:43.764 --> 07:47.200
Nine.

their life yesterday.

♪ You're not alone

10:22.455 --> 10:24.191
Hey, I rounded
on your post-ops,

10:24.224 --> 10:26.226
and Mrs. Shaugnessy
says her incision hurts,

10:26.259 --> 10:27.728
but there's no sign
of infection,

10:27.761 --> 10:30.030
so I just upped her morphine
for today. Okay.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.598
Oh, and Mr., uh, Mulligan
asked me

10:31.631 --> 10:33.066
to thank you again for--

10:33.100 --> 10:34.702
Why-- Why are you pacing?

10:34.735 --> 10:38.005
Oh, 'cause, um, I think
we have a match for Howard.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.572
And I love Howard.

10:39.606 --> 10:40.941
And, um, you know,
I'm just bursting to tell him,

10:40.974 --> 10:42.109
but it's not official yet.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.443
And I also don't want it
to seem like

10:43.476 --> 10:44.745
I'm rooting
for somebody's death, so--

10:44.778 --> 10:45.913
I'm not.
Uh, Dr. Pierce?

10:45.946 --> 10:47.547
Yes.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.549
I recognized you
from that article you wrote

10:49.582 --> 10:53.120
about racial disparities in
outcomes after bypass surgery. Yes.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.555
Well, wasn't a great picture.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.925
Okay.
I'm saying
that I recognized you

10:57.958 --> 10:59.326
even though that photo
looks nothing like you

10:59.359 --> 11:02.095
because I am a huge fan
of that paper.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.165
I read it three times.
You are brilliant. Oh.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.734
And, uh, I'm Dr. Jules Millin.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.168
I'm a first year
surgical intern.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.737
Dr. Millin,
are you just fangirling

11:09.770 --> 11:10.738
or did you come here
to tell her something?

11:10.771 --> 11:12.505
Oh, sorry. Yes.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.342
Um, I was told to tell you
that we got a call from UNOS--

11:15.375 --> 11:16.343
You have a heart
for Howard?

11:16.376 --> 11:18.411
Is Howard Mr. Jones?

11:18.445 --> 11:19.847
Yes!

11:19.880 --> 11:21.949
Yay! Yay, yay!

11:21.982 --> 11:23.183
Winston, will you--
Yeah, I'll-- I'll--

11:23.216 --> 11:24.451
I'll start the paperwork. Yeah.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.685
Oh, my gosh.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.020
Uh, Dr. Pierce, um,

11:27.054 --> 11:28.822
can I please join you?

11:28.856 --> 11:30.924
I just had to tell a family
the worst news of their life,

11:30.958 --> 11:33.126
and I could really use
some of the opposite.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.233
Ms. Milton, I'm Dr. Yasuda.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.402
Your daughter Marina
is showing distinct signs

11:42.435 --> 11:43.904
of brain activity.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.573
Her eyes are fixating
on stationary objects.

11:46.606 --> 11:50.577
But-- But I saw everyone.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.246
I saw all the other parents.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.916
You're-- You're saying
there's a chance she might live?

11:56.850 --> 11:58.251
She might live through this?

11:58.285 --> 11:59.619
We're continuing
to make adjustments

11:59.652 --> 12:01.789
to her ventilator
and her medications

12:01.822 --> 12:04.291
and hoping
the brain swelling comes down.

12:05.392 --> 12:09.162
And, yes, there is a chance
that she might live.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.467
I'm...

12:14.501 --> 12:16.203
too afraid to hope.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.243
Okay.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.212
I get that.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.815
How about if I hope for you?

12:27.848 --> 12:30.818
I have seven sisters, and one
of them is around Marina's age.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.686
So I will hope for Marina

12:33.720 --> 12:35.222
the way I would hope
for my own sister.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.827
Um, I'll keep you posted.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.836
Don't mind him.
He's a cry baby.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.170
I am.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.540
It's okay.
I'm emotional, too.

12:53.573 --> 12:56.143
You've waited so long
for this, Howard.

12:56.176 --> 12:59.646
I honestly didn't think
this day would come.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.014
Dr. Millin,
why don't you check

13:01.048 --> 13:02.349
Howard's blood pressure
while we're here?

13:03.516 --> 13:05.919
What is it--
bring your kid to work day?

13:05.953 --> 13:08.721
Our surgical residency program
just opened back up today,

13:08.755 --> 13:10.557
so we finally
have interns again.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.859
You look 12.
Are you 12?

13:11.892 --> 13:12.860
Uh, no, sir.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.561
We're just old, babe.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.064
We're so old that the young
adults look like children.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.066
And now you'll get to grow
even older together.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.236
Oh, no.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.538
He had just stopped. Sorry.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.877
Yay! They're here!

13:29.910 --> 13:32.045
The black scrubs
are here!

13:32.079 --> 13:33.213
Who are the black scrubs
for?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.548
Uh, for me, for OB.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.485
The female body has become
a war zone in this country,

13:38.518 --> 13:41.321
and pink
is a peacetime color.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.722
Got it.
So it's a statement.

13:42.755 --> 13:45.092
No, it's more
a state of mind. Yeah.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.293
Need some help?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.928
I'm good. You?

13:47.961 --> 13:49.796
Actually, yeah, I do.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.934
Um, do you remember that girl
from Saturday night?

13:53.967 --> 13:56.269
Um, the blonde?

13:56.303 --> 13:57.304
No, that was Thursday.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.072
Oh, um...
Oh, oh, yeah!

13:59.106 --> 14:00.540
The one that kind of looks
like the Snow White

14:00.573 --> 14:02.109
to your Prince Charming?
Yeah.

14:02.142 --> 14:05.012
And she had a Disney princessy
kind of name.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.346
Jules.
Yes!

14:06.379 --> 14:08.148
Yeah. Turns out
she works here now.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.018
Doing what?

14:12.419 --> 14:13.686
Surgical intern.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.689
Oh, my God!

14:17.857 --> 14:19.159
I'm-- I'm fired, right?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.693
I should just go
pack my things?

14:20.727 --> 14:23.296
You didn't know when you
brought her into our home

14:23.330 --> 14:24.932
that she was
an incoming resident?

14:24.965 --> 14:27.334
Well, there were drinks.
The bar was loud.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.469
She might have said it,
and I might have nodded

14:29.502 --> 14:32.539
like I heard it.
With your old man ears?

14:32.572 --> 14:34.607
That hurts. Okay,
so what am I supposed to do?

14:34.641 --> 14:37.777
Get ahead of it.
Talk to the chief.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.479
Woman on P.A.:
<i>Dr. Coen to PEDs ICU.</i>

14:39.512 --> 14:42.983
<i>Dr. Coen, report to PEDs ICU, please.</i>

14:43.016 --> 14:44.551
Oh, hey, man. Hey.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.119
- Hey.
- How you doing?

14:46.153 --> 14:47.787
Good.
Good, good, good.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.658
Hell of a day, man.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.093
Yeah, yeah.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.596
It's been a while
since I've seen you.

14:56.629 --> 14:57.597
Yeah.

14:57.630 --> 14:58.765
What do we do now?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.036
Dr. Ndugu,
may I join you?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.737
I would love to see
what's involved with procuring

15:04.771 --> 15:06.273
an organ
for a transplant.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.507
Yeah,
I guess that's fine.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.976
Yeah.
What, me too?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.079
O-Okay. Yeah.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.018
Man, I've never seen
a line like this.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.686
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.955
I've never heard of eight donors
in one hospital in one day.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.524
Freak storm, you know?
Terrible day.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.160
40 lives.
You said what?

15:27.194 --> 15:29.362
It's the worst math.
It's transplant surgeon math.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.332
We do it to comfort ourselves.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.534
8 deaths
saves up to 40 lives,

15:34.567 --> 15:36.336
and that's not including
skin and corneas.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.872
So, yes, it is a horrible day,
but it is also a beautiful day,

15:39.906 --> 15:41.574
and it all coexists.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.176
That is
a little comforting.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.551
So how's everything been here,
uh, since the shut down?

15:51.584 --> 15:53.920
Honestly, man,
it's been awful.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.389
I mean, a teaching hospital
with no residents?

15:56.423 --> 15:58.191
You know who ends up
with all the scut?

15:58.225 --> 15:59.559
The junior attending. Mm.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.428
You know who ends up
holding the clamps?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.163
The junior attending.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.565
And you know when that starts
to feel like hell?

16:05.598 --> 16:07.467
When the woman you love
is your boss.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.470
So it's been rough.

16:10.503 --> 16:14.074
I honestly just think I was
asking how Meredith's been.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.244
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Okay. Um, good.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.279
She's a--
She's a good chief.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.414
So she made that job official,
did she?

16:21.448 --> 16:23.083
Her title is interim chief,

16:23.116 --> 16:26.019
but, you know, six months in,
feels pretty official.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.687
Got it. Yeah.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.896
Yeah.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.467
I do, I understand.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.969
It's just my patient has been
waiting longer,

16:43.002 --> 16:46.173
and her cardiac and liver
function are deteriorating fast.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.141
Also, the donor is
in this hospital.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.609
Yes, I will hold.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.579
Um, I need you alone.
Link was here first.

16:52.612 --> 16:56.183
Oh, uh, yeah,
I-- I just...

16:57.950 --> 16:59.752
I slept with an intern.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.020
But I didn't know
she was an intern.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.856
It was-- It was before.
It was not today.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.526
It was...
Wow. This is awkward. Um...

17:06.559 --> 17:08.961
I'm in no position
to judge you on this.

17:08.995 --> 17:10.963
I do recommend you stay away
from elevators

17:10.997 --> 17:13.166
for the foreseeable future.

17:13.200 --> 17:17.003
Go to HR. They have paperwork
for this kind of thing.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.138
Thank you. Mm.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.806
Good luck.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.211
Nick's here.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.079
He's here.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.380
Nick Marsh!

17:27.414 --> 17:29.549
Don't try to be calm,
and don't try to be chiefly.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.017
The man you love is here,

17:31.050 --> 17:32.685
waiting for an organ
in the surgical corridor.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.821
Of course he is.
Half the transplant surgeons

17:34.854 --> 17:36.156
in the country are here.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.390
Well, then go talk to him, Meredith.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.891
I'm on the phone
with UNOS.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.693
There's a triple organ match
for Sarah Martinez.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.529
They're saying someone's
in line ahead of her.

17:42.562 --> 17:47.134
Meredith, you have been sad
for six months.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.801
Even Zola has noticed.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.303
Last week, she asked me
for Nick's phone number

17:50.337 --> 17:52.205
so that she could call him
and explain to him

17:52.239 --> 17:53.906
why you never
went to Minnesota

17:53.940 --> 17:56.476
and that maybe he would
understand and come and visit.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.745
And now he's here.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.013
And you love him.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.582
Don't be an idiot.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.551
You never told me
that story.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.587
Yes, I'm here.
Yes! Thank you so much.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.088
Thank you.
Dr. Grey.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.657
Um, sorry to interrupt. Yes.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.892
Uh, I have carefully considered,
and I feel...

18:14.261 --> 18:16.129
You hate OB.
More than I hate war.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.365
You'd make a good
chief resident.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.066
Seriously?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.610
Hi.
Hello.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.114
Dr. Adams.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.783
Did you bring the patient
down-- Liam Collins?

18:36.816 --> 18:39.419
Yes, Chief.
They're prepping him now.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.891
Dr. Marsh?
Mm-hmm?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.459
I just got off the phone
with UNOS.
Uh-huh.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.961
I have a triple organ transplant
match for my patient,

18:48.995 --> 18:50.530
Sarah Martinez.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.232
It's the first day
of the new residency program,

18:52.265 --> 18:56.068
and I can't really disappear
into an OR for 25 hours.

18:56.102 --> 18:59.239
So if you'd be willing
to take point on this,

18:59.272 --> 19:02.375
then I can find someone
to transport your organ

19:02.409 --> 19:03.976
back to Minnesota?

19:06.346 --> 19:08.881
A triple organ transplant,
that's what we're talking about?

19:08.915 --> 19:10.550
Those are super rare, yeah?

19:13.353 --> 19:16.623
Uh, ok--
Um, do you feel comfortable

19:16.656 --> 19:18.325
taking the liver
back to Minnesota?

19:18.358 --> 19:20.460
It's for Chen. It's his patient.
He's doing the transplant.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.430
No problem. Okay.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.097
I will scrub in.

19:25.131 --> 19:28.935
Great.
This is... very helpful.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.703
Good.
Shall we go and meet

19:30.737 --> 19:33.440
Sarah Martinez and her family
and deliver the good news?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.007
Let's do it. Okay.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.510
Dr. Ndugu.
Dr. Grey.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.014
That is not how I thought
that would go.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.716
No.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.686
Who has patient number 35467,
Liam Collins?

19:46.719 --> 19:47.954
Oh, that's me.
Or, um...

19:47.987 --> 19:49.456
I just sent him off
to pre-op.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.723
Why didn't you talk
to his family?
I did.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.525
You didn't.
His mom is in the ICU,

19:52.559 --> 19:54.026
screaming
at Dr. Shepherd.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.528
What? No, I--

19:55.562 --> 19:58.130
Okay, I know I definitely spoke
to somebody's mother.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.466
Congratulations
on your first day...

19:59.499 --> 20:00.633
I--

20:00.667 --> 20:02.802
...and also your last.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.437
Gotta be some sort of record, right?

20:11.778 --> 20:12.845
I really am so sorry.
I don't know how this happened,

20:14.647 --> 20:15.848
but I w-- I will--
You will what?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.284
What can you possibly do
to fix this?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.386
Mrs. Collins,
I know that you have suffered

20:19.419 --> 20:21.521
the worst loss
of your life today,

20:21.554 --> 20:24.957
and my intern made
a terrible mistake

20:24.991 --> 20:26.559
in speaking
to the wrong parent,

20:26.593 --> 20:29.429
but I did do the final
round of tests on your son.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.130
I did declare him
brain-dead.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.932
How am I supposed
to trust you?

20:32.965 --> 20:36.168
I wasn't given the chance to say
goodbye to my child.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.670
How am I supposed
to trust your tests

20:37.704 --> 20:39.138
when you and your staff
are capable

20:39.171 --> 20:41.007
of making this kind
of mistake?!

20:43.175 --> 20:45.378
Oh, my sweetheart. Okay.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.613
Oh, my sweet love.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.516
Ma'am, I am so sorry.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.518
Mrs. Collins, uh,
would you like me

20:51.551 --> 20:53.185
to run
the last test again?

20:53.219 --> 20:56.589
I would like you to run
<i>all</i> the tests again.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.428
This is Dr. Grey's
triple organ match.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.196
Then you had better
go talk to Dr. Grey.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.436
Go with him, please.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.438
Make sure he doesn't
screw this up, too.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.277
Group hug!

21:19.612 --> 21:22.114
Everyone joins.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.950
Oh, everyone join.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.518
I don't know who you are,

21:25.552 --> 21:27.086
but those
are the rules of group hug.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.055
Davis, you're embarrassing yourself.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.290
I can live with that.
And it's all three organs?

21:31.324 --> 21:32.759
She's getting
all three of them?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.193
Today?
Yes.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.762
Well, if you don't crush
her surgeons first.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.197
Oh, jeez.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.899
Oh.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.036
Say it again. I want
to make sure I understand.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.272
I spoke with the wrong family,
and so Liam's mom

21:46.305 --> 21:47.774
almost didn't get
a chance to say goodbye.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.509
And so she's--
she's upset.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.244
I'm sure "upset"
doesn't begin to cover

21:52.278 --> 21:53.746
how that woman feels
right now.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.682
Okay. Is she saying
goodbye to him now?

21:55.715 --> 21:57.249
No.
No?

21:58.250 --> 22:00.520
I need more, Adams.
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.955
I'm-- I'm so sorry.
Dr. Adams,
save your shame

22:02.989 --> 22:04.491
for after your shift.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.825
Your shame spiral is about you,
and right now,

22:05.858 --> 22:07.827
we need it to be
all about our patients.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.562
You understand?
Griffith?

22:09.596 --> 22:12.298
The mom asked Dr. Shepherd
to run all of the tests again.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.933
Is she doing that?
It felt like if she didn't,

22:13.966 --> 22:15.435
the organs would not
be donated.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.969
Okay,
what's the patient's status?

22:17.003 --> 22:18.738
He's brain-dead.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.441
I-- Yes, I understand that,
but were his vitals stable?

22:21.474 --> 22:23.443
Do you understand
why he's asking that?

22:23.476 --> 22:25.912
He's asking you that because
if the patient codes--

22:25.945 --> 22:27.847
if the patient's heart stops

22:27.880 --> 22:30.149
before Dr. Shepherd's
finished running the tests,

22:30.182 --> 22:31.684
then you get to be
the one who goes in

22:31.718 --> 22:34.020
and tells that family that
their one-in-a-million match

22:34.053 --> 22:36.989
just got wasted
because of your error.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.491
Stop looking at me
like that.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.192
Go help Dr. Shepherd!

22:51.704 --> 22:54.240
Mrs. Collins
has her family doctor here now,

22:54.273 --> 22:55.908
and she wants him
to sign off on the tests.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.478
She does not trust us
as far as she can kick us,

22:58.511 --> 23:00.913
and I cannot blame her.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.715
Dr. Griffith.
I'll go get him.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.717
Mm-hmm.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.352
They had the same name.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.020
And Mrs. Collins,
her first name is Jane,

23:08.054 --> 23:09.589
and I said,
"Are you Jane?"

23:09.622 --> 23:10.923
And the other lady,
she said yes,

23:10.957 --> 23:13.426
and I guess
they had the same name.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.827
You used the first name.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.529
Well, I was trying to be
more personal

23:16.563 --> 23:18.665
because I was about to tell her
her son was brain-dead.

23:18.698 --> 23:22.234
Yeah, but you can see now
why we don't do that.

23:22.268 --> 23:23.302
Yes.

23:24.504 --> 23:27.339
Meanwhile,
who did you talk to?

23:27.373 --> 23:29.241
Is there someone named Jane
walking around now who--

23:29.275 --> 23:30.810
who thinks that her child
is brain-dead...

23:30.843 --> 23:32.178
No, no.
...and he isn't?

23:32.211 --> 23:34.514
No. I checked.
Her name is Jane Miller

23:34.547 --> 23:36.883
and her son <i>is</i> brain-dead...
too.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.385
Mrs. Collins?
Dr. Shepherd sent me.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.854
This is our family doctor,
Dr. Shagrin.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.756
Dr. Shagrin,
I'm Dr. Griffith.

23:43.790 --> 23:44.991
We're hoping we could get
your opinion.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.264
I am so deeply sorry
for your loss,

24:58.297 --> 25:00.299
but Dr. Shagrin
has confirmed...

25:16.816 --> 25:19.118
Mrs. Collins...

25:19.151 --> 25:20.953
my name
is Dr. Benson Kwan,

25:20.987 --> 25:23.823
and I lost my brother
in an accident...

25:23.856 --> 25:25.391
...when he was only 16.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.596
It was devastating, and my life
was never the same.

25:29.629 --> 25:32.498
And there is nothing
anyone can say

25:32.531 --> 25:34.300
that can take
your pain away,

25:34.333 --> 25:37.336
but the lives my brother saved
when he donated his organs?

25:38.971 --> 25:40.840
I think about them.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.110
I still think about the
little girl who got his heart,

25:44.143 --> 25:45.812
the teenage boy
who got his kidney,

25:45.845 --> 25:48.681
and the grandmother
who got his liver.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.883
Because those people
give his death

25:50.917 --> 25:52.785
some little bit
of meaning.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.788
And I cling to that.

25:55.822 --> 25:58.524
I cling to it
after all these years.

26:06.599 --> 26:08.835
Tell Dr. Shepherd
I consent.

26:19.545 --> 26:21.080
Thank you.
Your brother just saved

26:21.113 --> 26:22.414
a whole bunch more lives.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.516
Never had a brother,
but you're welcome.

26:33.993 --> 26:34.460
What does your gut say?

26:35.628 --> 26:37.496
My gut? Uh...

26:37.529 --> 26:39.398
My gut says she's getting
her organs today.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.200
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

26:41.233 --> 26:44.170
Well, I don't know.
Sometimes my gut is wrong.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.707
I shouldn't have told you
to go back to Minnesota.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.209
I called after you.
You didn't hear me.

26:50.242 --> 26:51.944
Oh, I-- I heard you.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.914
You did?
Yeah, I heard you.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.515
Yeah, but...

26:58.117 --> 27:00.419
I was hurt. I was.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.755
I wanted you to do more
than call my name.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.456
I wanted you
to put in some effort.

27:04.490 --> 27:05.792
It was a bad day.

27:05.825 --> 27:08.695
It's been six months.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.830
It's been a very difficult
six months.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.298
Mm-hmm.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.668
And you know how
I'm so stubborn and so proud.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.837
Same.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.405
Uh, you got approval.
I got approval.

27:19.438 --> 27:20.740
- Okay.
- Excuse you?

27:20.773 --> 27:22.408
We both got approval. Yeah.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.510
Okay, well, you both
can be in the surgery.

27:24.543 --> 27:25.778
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I thought I was lead surgeon.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.013
You are. Okay.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.280
Yes. He...

27:28.314 --> 27:29.982
You can both
be in the surgery.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.951
Okay, let's go.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.619
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.422
I read that they can turn
your body into a pod

27:36.455 --> 27:38.624
and plant you as fertilizer
for a tree,

27:38.657 --> 27:39.859
and that's what I want.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.593
What?
Mom, don't be morose.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.796
It's not morose.
It's what I want.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.932
I want to be a tree
that you and the kids

27:45.965 --> 27:49.736
and all the grandkids
can picnic under.

27:49.769 --> 27:53.572
I want to make oxygen
and fight global warming.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.641
I don't want to
become pollution,

27:55.674 --> 27:59.812
and that's what a casket is,
and that's what cremation is.

27:59.846 --> 28:03.415
It's land pollution,
and it's air pollution.

28:03.449 --> 28:07.920
If I die today,
or when I die whenever,

28:07.954 --> 28:13.025
just remember, sweetheart,
I want to be a tree.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.061
I want to watch
over our family.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.630
Forever.

28:18.664 --> 28:19.899
You ready?

28:23.602 --> 28:25.004
I'm ready.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.387
It's a no.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.390
Uh, you said it's a no?

28:44.423 --> 28:46.392
Dr. Millin, would you like
to close the chest?

28:46.425 --> 28:49.695
What?
The heart has hematomas everywhere.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.164
It is not usable
for transplant.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.000
I can close,
Dr. Pierce.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.635
Nonsense. She knows how to do
a running subcuticular stitch.

28:56.668 --> 28:59.671
I'm sure she's practiced
on a thousand oranges.

28:59.705 --> 29:01.373
Human flesh
is a little bit firmer.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.775
You're gonna have to pull
a little bit harder.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.210
Uh, what about Howard?

29:04.243 --> 29:06.245
You'll explain to Howard
and his husband

29:06.278 --> 29:07.914
that Howard will remain
on the transplant list,

29:07.947 --> 29:09.248
but today was not his day.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.616
B-But his husband
couldn't stop crying.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.384
I know. It sucks.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.420
But we take the good
with the bad here, Dr. Millin.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.889
Schmitt, keep an eye.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.727
O-Okay.
Um, 4-0 Monocryl, please.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.229
You say please to Bokhee!

29:23.262 --> 29:25.697
I did.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.199
Right here. There.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.634
They just keep
getting younger.

29:28.667 --> 29:29.701
Right?

29:34.974 --> 29:36.809
Adams, what are you doing?

29:36.843 --> 29:39.378
I screwed up. I just want
to make sure she's okay.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.747
You want to scrub in?
For real?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.782
'Cause I'm pretty sure
I'm getting fired later.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.786
Well, if they haven't fired you
yet, you still got a shot.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.622
Look, here's the deal.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.258
We all have bad days.
We all make mistakes.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.625
You just got to learn
from them.

29:53.659 --> 29:55.227
You learn from them,
you're good.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.595
Right?
What'd you learn today?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.130
Uh.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.099
Raise my hand
before talking,

30:00.132 --> 30:01.868
save the shame
for the end of the day,

30:01.901 --> 30:04.736
and use full names
when speaking with next of kin.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.405
Yes. Okay.

30:06.438 --> 30:07.874
That's good.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.376
Come on.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.478
End your day better
than it started.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.713
Okay? Let's go.

30:14.746 --> 30:16.548
Come on, let's go!

30:28.928 --> 30:31.297
Okay, so this is going to be
a long, arduous surgery.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.965
Let's pace ourselves.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.367
And say a prayer now
if you're the praying kind.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.369
The donor is Liam Collins.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.906
He loved rugby,
and he loved science.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.909
The recipient is Sarah Martinez,
and she loves nature,

30:42.942 --> 30:45.211
and she's about to be
a grandmother.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.413
It's a beautiful day
to save lives.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.617
It's a beautiful day
to save lives.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.588
Derek was a God to him.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.258
I know. Scalpel.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.560
And Lucas was
Derek's favorite nephew,

31:01.593 --> 31:04.063
and I do love him,
so I hate to keep saying this,

31:04.096 --> 31:05.998
but I don't think
he has what it takes.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.467
I know you don't.
He's a mess.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.635
He doesn't follow instructions.

31:09.668 --> 31:12.004
He has to do everything
his own way.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.273
Did you hire him because
he reminds you of Derek?

31:16.075 --> 31:18.810
No. Not Derek.

31:18.844 --> 31:21.480
He is a mess. He does need
to do things his own way.

31:21.513 --> 31:25.051
Mm-hmm.
But he also has a stroke
of the family genius.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.486
And he's a bit
of a black sheep.

31:27.519 --> 31:28.854
You don't see it, do you?

31:33.892 --> 31:35.394
Is that why
he drives me crazy?

31:35.427 --> 31:38.464
He's me.

31:38.497 --> 31:40.266
Yes, he's you.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.468
He's got the spark.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.203
He's got the drive.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.772
He just needs a chance.

31:46.805 --> 31:50.042
I had to be watched very closely
at that age.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.677
Great.
Are you volunteering?

31:51.710 --> 31:54.346

It's endless.
I mean, it's exhilarating.

35:16.182 --> 35:17.749
It's devastating.

35:17.783 --> 35:20.752
I-I told a person
that his wife was dead today,

35:20.786 --> 35:24.323
and then another man that his
husband wasn't getting a heart.

35:24.356 --> 35:29.094
But I also sewed human flesh
on a living human being,

35:29.127 --> 35:33.232
which was nothing like an orange
and different from a cadaver,

35:33.265 --> 35:34.700

signing this?

35:41.740 --> 35:43.609
