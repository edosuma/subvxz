WEBVTT

00:37.705 --> 00:39.540
Ah!

00:39.573 --> 00:40.641
The great outdoors!

00:40.674 --> 00:43.577
What's so great about it?
We're sleeping on rocks!

00:43.611 --> 00:44.812
Rocks!

00:44.845 --> 00:47.581
And all there is to eat
is beef jerky. Blah!

00:47.615 --> 00:49.550
And there are no toilets.

00:49.583 --> 00:53.154
I am still the confused
as to why we are sleeping
out of the doors!

00:53.187 --> 00:54.455
Is the Tower broken?

00:54.488 --> 00:57.525
No! We're out here because
camping is fun!

00:57.558 --> 01:00.728
Hiking, making s'mores,
campfires...

01:00.761 --> 01:03.597
BEAST BOY: Mosquito bites.
CYBORG: Wild animal attacks.

01:03.631 --> 01:04.798
STARFIRE: The body odors.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.167
Can we go home?

01:06.200 --> 01:08.836
No! You are having
too much fun!

01:08.869 --> 01:10.604
Fine! Let's just watch
some TV.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.706
Where are you going to
plug in a TV?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.842
He's right! I don't see
any outlets!

01:14.875 --> 01:16.710
You mean... No TV?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.581
We don't need TV
to entertain us!

01:20.614 --> 01:23.617
That's what scary campfire
stories are for.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.853
Huh! That could be fun.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.588
You think my idea
could be fun?

01:27.621 --> 01:28.989
Sure! Why not?

01:29.022 --> 01:30.824
And you're going to do it,
and I don't have to
scream at anyone?

01:30.858 --> 01:33.161
It sounds the delightful.

01:33.194 --> 01:37.298
Keep it together,
Robin. Don't blow this.
For once they're all excited.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.367
Hmm, not me.
I still want to go home.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.901
Three out of four!
I'll take it!

01:40.934 --> 01:42.336
Who wants to go first?

01:42.370 --> 01:44.872
I do!
I gots a super scary story!

01:44.905 --> 01:48.676
I just hope you all brought
a change of underpants.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.745
BEAST BOY: So, there was
this lumberjack dude who was
lost in the woods

01:51.779 --> 01:53.647
and all walking around
in circles like a fool.

01:53.681 --> 01:58.319
He was like, "Man, I'm crazy
lost and walking around
in circles like a fool."

01:58.352 --> 02:03.391
But then he found a cabin,
and he was all like, "Cool.
I'm gonna just chill in here."

02:03.424 --> 02:07.428
But what he didn't know
is that some other lumberjack
dude said it was haunted.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.163
That place is so haunted.

02:10.998 --> 02:14.635
BEAST BOY: So the lumberjack
dude was all chilling
when he heard it!

02:14.668 --> 02:16.304
Some creepy voice...

02:16.337 --> 02:20.374
I got you where I want you.
Now I'm gonna eat you.

02:20.408 --> 02:23.811
The lumberjack dude, well,
he's been around the block
a few times

02:23.844 --> 02:27.515
and isn't that scared by it,
so he starts chilling again!

02:27.548 --> 02:30.918
But the creepy voice
started again, only louder!

02:30.951 --> 02:34.722
I got you where I want you!
Now I'm gonna eat you!

02:34.755 --> 02:37.858
This lumberjack dude
is getting creeped out.

02:37.891 --> 02:42.596
He's all like, "I need to
find out where that creepy
voice is coming from!"

02:42.630 --> 02:47.668
I got you where I want you.
Now I'm gonna eat you.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.838
He accidently finds
this secret hidden room.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.706
Crazy spooky!

02:52.740 --> 02:56.810
The lumberjack dude was like,
"I'mma go into that
creepy hidden room, yo!"

02:56.844 --> 02:59.647
-It was completely empty,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.983
except for this weird,
spooky tiny stage.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.554
He pulled the curtain back
and you know what he saw?

03:06.587 --> 03:09.957
A crazy little monkey with a
booger on his finger saying,

03:09.990 --> 03:13.794
"I got you where I want you.
Now I'm gonna eat you!"

03:17.798 --> 03:19.233
CYBORG: Aw, really?
STARFIRE: That was
the disgusting.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.537
Oh, I got you so good!

03:23.571 --> 03:25.005
You should see your faces!

03:25.038 --> 03:26.507
BEAST BOY: Oh!

03:26.540 --> 03:28.309
That's for telling a story
about a booger!

03:28.342 --> 03:29.810
Seriously, can we go home now?

03:29.843 --> 03:33.847
First, I wish to attempt the
telling of the spooky story.

03:33.881 --> 03:39.520
On a scary day,
the friends were having
the good friend times.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.255
And doing the
regular friend things,

03:41.289 --> 03:48.429
until the spooky ghost man
came from his grave,
and scared everyone!

03:48.462 --> 03:53.867
I am the spooky ghost man,
and I am haunting you!

03:56.904 --> 03:59.807
The friends narrowly escaped!

03:59.840 --> 04:02.676
The spooky ghost man
was very scary,

04:02.710 --> 04:05.846
but they were safe from his
hauntings in the bushy bush.

04:05.879 --> 04:11.319
They all breathed
the breath of relief,
until they realized

04:11.352 --> 04:14.888
the ghost had their ball!

04:14.922 --> 04:16.290
Dun-dun-dun.

04:16.324 --> 04:20.294
Pew, pew, pew!
Thunders, thunders,
lightnings!

04:20.328 --> 04:21.929
"What should we do?"
they cried!

04:21.962 --> 04:27.034
If we do not have the ball,
we cannot play the catch!

04:27.067 --> 04:28.101
Pew!

04:28.135 --> 04:30.538
Then the spooky
ghost man returned,

04:30.571 --> 04:35.409
and he said, "I'm sorry
I scared you.

04:35.443 --> 04:39.313
"I am the socially awkward!"

04:40.648 --> 04:43.517
He was very sorry
about scaring everyone,

04:43.551 --> 04:44.852
and brought the ball
for the friends,

04:44.885 --> 04:48.589
so they could all enjoy
playing the catch together.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.326
Oh! And there were also
two wolfmans!

04:52.360 --> 04:56.830
Woof! Woof woof! Woof! Woof!

04:58.832 --> 05:02.470
It seems I have
succeeded in the telling of
the spooky story!

05:02.503 --> 05:04.672
Nah, that's just Robin getting
mauled by a bear.

05:04.705 --> 05:08.642
-The bear is eating me!
He is eating me!

05:08.676 --> 05:10.811
Huh, he must have
smelled the s'mores.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.948
Can we just go home?

05:14.982 --> 05:21.355
Nope! 'Cause it's my turn
for a scary story!

05:21.389 --> 05:24.057
CYBORG: I was out one night
taking a relaxing night drive,

05:24.091 --> 05:26.994
eating some peanuts,
you know, got some of that
good music going,

05:27.027 --> 05:29.863
when suddenly,
there's a breaking
news report on the radio.

05:29.897 --> 05:33.601
ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this
broadcast to report an escaped
mental patient on the loose.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.569
He is dangerous, and
he has a hook for a hand.

05:35.603 --> 05:38.506
Police recommend
you stay inside and
lock all doors and windows.

05:38.539 --> 05:42.710
CYBORG: So I'm eating my nuts,
and I hear this report,
you know, and I say, "Nuh-uh!"

05:42.743 --> 05:44.712
And I flip my car around
and go home.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.815
I'm not about to be driving
around at night when there's
crazy pants hook-hand dude

05:47.848 --> 05:50.618
creeping around
in the bushes. No way!

05:50.651 --> 05:52.986
So later that night,
I'm at home, you know,

05:53.020 --> 05:57.024
doors locked, eating some
peanuts, got some of that good
music going, and suddenly...

05:57.057 --> 05:59.860
So I pick it up!

05:59.893 --> 06:02.863
-But there's no one
on the line.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.998
So I listen closer,
and I hear...

06:08.502 --> 06:11.905
I hang up, and I think,
I should just ignore
this prank caller.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.974
Then I say, "Nuh-uh!",
and I call the police,

06:14.007 --> 06:16.143
demand they come over
to the Tower, and investigate.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.545
And it's a good thing I did.

06:17.578 --> 06:22.015
There was some creepy prowler
calling from inside the house!

06:22.049 --> 06:23.951
They arrested him, of course.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.119
I had to go to the police
station and ID him, testify
against him in a court of law.

06:26.153 --> 06:29.056
It was a whole process, man,
but the system worked!

06:29.089 --> 06:32.760
-And he's gonna be in jail
for a very long time.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.728
Point being, you can never
be too careful.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.431
There's a lot of crazies
out there. Hoo, doggie!

06:37.465 --> 06:40.167
That wasn't scary
at all, Cyborg.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.103
It has given me
the sleepies.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.772
So disappointed, brah.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.074
What can I say?
I'm a very cautious person.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.142
Okay. Well then,
time to go home.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.745
-Don't you want to hear
my scary story?
-Absolutely not.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.482
Great! And what makes
my story extra scary

06:54.515 --> 06:56.650
is that it's all true.

06:59.019 --> 07:03.557
ROBIN: It was a dark
and stormy night,
and I forgot my umbrella.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.694
So I got completely soaked.
It was terrible!

07:06.727 --> 07:08.962
The hair I spent hours on,
ruined!

07:08.996 --> 07:11.799
Normally, this would be
a big deal by itself,

07:11.832 --> 07:15.168
but tonight, I had a date
with a real girl.

07:15.202 --> 07:18.238
In your face, everybody who
said it would never happen!

07:18.271 --> 07:20.240
-I had purposely
shown up late

07:20.273 --> 07:22.743
because I didn't want to be
the first one to arrive.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.712
But there was no sign of her.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.815
I started to get nervous.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.550
Did I look like a loser
sitting there all alone?

07:29.583 --> 07:32.052
-Was everyone thinking I was
eating yet another meal

07:32.085 --> 07:34.221
all by myself?
So what if I like to
eat by myself?

07:34.254 --> 07:38.559
Robin, party of one?
More like, Robin,
party of fun!

07:38.592 --> 07:43.997
With what felt like a million
beady eyes staring at me,
I had to get out of there.

07:44.031 --> 07:47.200
I was starting to sweat.
So I tried to cool off.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.237
Instead, I splashed water
all over my pants!

07:50.270 --> 07:53.841
Everyone was
going to think I peed myself!
But it was water, just water!

07:53.874 --> 07:56.076
Sure, it looks like pee,
but it's not! It was water!

07:56.109 --> 07:59.046
I didn't pee myself!
I haven't done that
in a very long time.

08:01.782 --> 08:06.987
I tried to stay calm, but
that's when I heard the
scariest sound ever.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.226
ROBIN: It was my stomach!

08:13.260 --> 08:18.866
I decided to order, and also
eat the box of chocolates
I'd brought for my date.

08:18.899 --> 08:22.936
She never came.
But the check did.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.607
I'd assumed my date would be
paying for the meal,
so I didn't bring my wallet.

08:26.640 --> 08:31.712
Not knowing
what to do, I ran and ran
and ran and ran,

08:31.745 --> 08:34.915
and never stopped running!

08:35.949 --> 08:37.217
And it's all true.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.854
You are a sad little man,
aren't you?

08:40.888 --> 08:41.889
Yes, I am.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.594
Well, that was terrifying.
Now can we go home?

08:46.627 --> 08:50.163
Not until you have told
the scary story, Raven.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.700
You want a scary story? Sure.

08:52.733 --> 08:56.203
RAVEN: Once upon a time,
a creature of darkness crawled
into the world.

08:56.236 --> 09:01.141
The light hurt her eyes, so
she shut all but two of them.

09:01.174 --> 09:05.579
To hide herself from
the light, she wrapped herself
in a cloak of darkness.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.347
The lady in the cloak
made friends.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.251
A man made of tin. A princess.
A hyena.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.221
And a tiny, tiny little elf.

09:14.254 --> 09:19.192
Together they did noble deeds,
and for a time the lady in the
cloak lived as one of them.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.228
Over time she grew weary.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.196
"Booyah!" yelled the tin man.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.733
"Train! Pay attention!
Mandatory meetings!"

09:25.766 --> 09:27.400
screeched the tiny,
tiny little elf.

09:27.434 --> 09:32.072
The hyena laughed and laughed,
and the princess, well,
she was cool.

09:32.105 --> 09:36.143
But every day,
they grew louder,
and louder, and louder!

09:36.977 --> 09:38.111
Until one night

09:38.145 --> 09:40.047
she snapped!

09:40.080 --> 09:43.684
Throwing aside her cloak, they
saw she was a monster that had
been hiding among them.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.754
Her fingers became claws,
her teeth, razors.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.857
She opened all of
her hideous eyes.

09:49.890 --> 09:54.027
Then, fast as a serpent,
she ate them!

09:54.061 --> 09:55.996
One by one.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.102
What, uh...
What happened to the monster?

10:02.135 --> 10:03.136
Nothing.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.305
Because I'm the monster!

10:06.907 --> 10:08.241
Retreat to the Tower!

10:08.275 --> 10:09.643
Retreat!

10:12.980 --> 10:16.116
So... We're going home? Cool.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.987
I love
campfire stories.
