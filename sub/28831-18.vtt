What are you doing
about this manifesto?

00:01.877 --> 00:04.963
"Why the women engineers
at Speckulate aren't
equal to the men"?

00:04.963 --> 00:06.632
The email came from Raj.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.385
So you have feelings for me.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.888
But I have a boyfriend
who I really love.

00:12.888 --> 00:15.057
‐Please. I can explain.
‐Raj: I'm sure you can.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.642
You're the best
con artist I know.

audition for the Comedy Be

00:20.437 --> 00:22.147

00:22.147 --> 00:24.233
Maybe we can
do it again sometime.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.151
I really need to be
single for a while.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.612
So the city attorney
doesn't want this trial.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.864
‐I think you call their bluff.
‐What, you think doing time

00:30.864 --> 00:32.449
is some type of
badge of honor
or something?

00:32.449 --> 00:35.077
‐How about a little respect?
‐Yo, you don't deserve
my respect.

00:43.126 --> 00:46.505
You don't need my approval
to do kids' parties
with Isabella.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.382
You're an amazing guy, okay?

00:55.722 --> 00:57.349
I don't think I'm gonna
stay the night tonight.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.309
I kind of feel like
I need to be alone.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.644
God bless you!

01:00.644 --> 01:02.229
‐Hands! Let me see
your hands!
‐Callie: No, no!

01:02.229 --> 01:03.647
No, no, no, he's not violent!

01:03.647 --> 01:05.440
At the last minute,
they asked me to step in

01:05.440 --> 01:06.817
<i>on this negotiation today.</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:08.819

is giving them cash vouchers

01:08.819 --> 01:10.404
<i>to voluntarily move out</i>
<i>of their homes.</i>

01:10.404 --> 01:13.240

02:02.456 --> 02:04.666

they're planning to build

02:04.666 --> 02:07.627

on the South Solano
apartment site?

02:07.627 --> 02:11.632

along with the condos.

We've done an internal
investigation into the source

02:23.310 --> 02:25.437

that was sent to
the company Slack.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.899

02:28.899 --> 02:31.109

02:31.109 --> 02:33.153

‐You need to leave
the building now.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.615

Speckulate work product.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.416

02:47.709 --> 02:49.544

‐Whoa.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.174
Callie:
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

02:54.174 --> 02:58.470
<i>I was just curious why Anwei</i>
<i>doubled the payout offer</i>

just so you know,

‐Floss regularly?
‐Lindsay: (laughs) Yeah.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.854

audition for the CBTV
program.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.273

hooked up with you.

and not asking you.

‐Hmm.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.408

You just started.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.869
And these judges
aren't gonna see you
and think, like,

12:24.869 --> 12:26.996

12:26.996 --> 12:30.959

the program is to help you grow.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.510

12:41.052 --> 12:43.054
Well, Lindsay's
