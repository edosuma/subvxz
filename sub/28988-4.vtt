WEBVTT

00:10.314 --> 00:11.228
- My Lord.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.403
I know this man.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.405
This is Carl Jeffries,
my neighbor.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.146
What are you doing with
a picture of him like this?

00:16.190 --> 00:17.408
- It's just work stuff.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.149
- That shit with North Park
is nothing

00:19.193 --> 00:20.585
compared to what
she could find.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.674
She's a threat
to both of us, Bobby.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.285
- And that's why I hired her.

00:24.328 --> 00:25.503
- Seven days?
That's not enough time

00:25.547 --> 00:27.201
to pack a goddamn toothbrush,

00:27.244 --> 00:28.463
much less find
a place to live.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.813
My family gets the 90 days
they're entitled to,

00:30.856 --> 00:33.076
and the union's
off your back.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.338
- Last time we shook,
it came back

00:34.382 --> 00:35.774
to bite me in the ass.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.341
- Remember that.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.777
- She asked
if I'd be her driver.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.692
- I'm talking to you, lady.
What are you gonna do?

00:40.736 --> 00:42.694
- I work for the fucking mayor.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.087
I can do whatever I want.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.176
- You have a problem
you need solved.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.352
Why don't you tell me
what Pat McGann has on you?

00:48.396 --> 00:50.224
- Taking that trial in Miami.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.487
- So much for having my back.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.504
You got my message.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.114
- I've had books on tape
that were shorter.

01:13.421 --> 01:14.378
Seriously, though,
it was good

01:14.422 --> 01:17.729
to hear your voice.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.688
- Thank you for the flowers.

01:19.731 --> 01:20.863
They were beautiful.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.908
- Speaking of beautiful,

01:22.952 --> 01:25.259
any chance you can take off
a few days and get down here?

01:25.302 --> 01:26.608
- Jeff--
- Come on, Jess.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.305
When was the last time
you took a vacation?

01:28.349 --> 01:30.568
- When's the last time
I started a new job?

01:30.612 --> 01:32.527
- Is that the only reason?

01:32.570 --> 01:34.442
- That, and those pictures
you sent me.

01:34.485 --> 01:36.357
- And what exactly
does that mean?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.619
- I've arranged
for Nick D'Amato to be

01:37.662 --> 01:39.751
my driver.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.797
- The cop?

01:41.840 --> 01:43.320
Are you out of your mind?

01:43.364 --> 01:45.235
- Jeff, I need to get
close to him.

01:45.279 --> 01:47.281
I need to find out if he's--

01:47.324 --> 01:49.152
- What, a murderer?

01:49.196 --> 01:50.806
- You're the one that said
I need to keep my eyes open.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.242
- Right, let me ask you this.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.418
What happens if you find out
your chauffeur cop

01:54.462 --> 01:55.898
killed that man
who was suing the city?

01:55.941 --> 01:58.161
You're gonna go to the FBI,

01:58.205 --> 01:59.554
or you're gonna walk away
from this new job of yours?

01:59.597 --> 02:01.164
- Let me find out first.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.252
- That's not
a very comforting answer.

02:02.296 --> 02:03.688
- Jeff, please.

02:03.732 --> 02:04.863
- I'm not getting
off this phone

02:04.907 --> 02:08.171
until I get a goddamn answer.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.433
- Well, I'm going to be
in his car

02:09.477 --> 02:11.957
in about 30 seconds,
so one of us is.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.220
- These are
dangerous people, Jessica.

02:13.263 --> 02:14.308
This is not your world.

02:14.351 --> 02:15.613
- I know what I'm doing, Jeff.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.833
I'll call you later.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.575
- Did he tell you how long
he'd be gone?

02:20.618 --> 02:23.404
- No, he just said that he's
taking her to the Mayo Clinic.

02:23.447 --> 02:24.622
- Shit.
He was already out

02:24.666 --> 02:26.450
the other day.
If he stays AWOL too long,

02:26.494 --> 02:28.322
the press is gonna
start wondering.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.585
- Not if you avoid them.

02:30.628 --> 02:31.847
- Good morning, everyone.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.457
I want to relay a message
from the mayor.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.763
He's going to be out-of-pocket
for the next few days.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.460
- Told you something's
wrong with him.

02:36.504 --> 02:37.722
- There's nothing
wrong with him.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.246
Mayor's just taking
a much-needed vacation

02:39.289 --> 02:40.377
with his wife.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.639
So if anybody has a problem
with that,

02:41.683 --> 02:43.467
take it up with him.
- In the meantime,

02:43.511 --> 02:44.903
he's left Keri
in charge of the day-to-day.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.209
Anything I need
to make a statement on,

02:46.253 --> 02:47.645
come to her first for counsel.

02:47.689 --> 02:51.388
- If we elected officials
are allowed to speak,

02:51.432 --> 02:52.911
I think it's time
for the mayor's office

02:52.955 --> 02:55.305
to make a public statement
about Fred Hampton.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.872
We're coming up on
the 50th anniversary

02:56.915 --> 02:58.308
of his death,
and we still haven't--

02:58.352 --> 02:59.440
- Lloyd, you've brought this up

02:59.483 --> 03:00.832
with Bobby in the past,
I believe.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.791
- Yes, I have,
but Bobby's not here.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.314
I'm talking to Derrick,

03:04.358 --> 03:05.881
and I am the deputy mayor.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.448
- Lloyd, I just don't think
this is the appropriate time--

03:07.491 --> 03:08.927
- Yes, I know, I know.

03:08.971 --> 03:11.930
The mayor is out-of-pocket
or out of town,

03:11.974 --> 03:13.976
or where'd you say
he was again?

03:14.019 --> 03:15.499
- Keri's right.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.240
I spoke with the mayor
this morning,

03:17.284 --> 03:20.330
and he was very specific
about there being no surprises

03:20.374 --> 03:21.679
while he's gone.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.507
But, Lloyd, I'd be
more than happy

03:23.551 --> 03:24.856
to look into
the Hampton matter,

03:24.900 --> 03:26.815
if you'd like.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.860
- Thank you, but that
won't be necessary.

03:28.904 --> 03:31.472
- Okay, if that's it,
we all have a job to do,

03:31.515 --> 03:34.257
so let's have a productive
and uneventful day.

03:40.437 --> 03:43.527
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.529
- I can't thank you
for having my back in there?

03:45.573 --> 03:48.271
- That little R&R speech
might have satisfied the staff,

03:48.315 --> 03:50.273
but I'm not staff.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.579
- I don't know what
to tell you.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.755
- I saw the mayor
the other morning, Keri.

03:53.798 --> 03:56.453
That's not a man
with vacation on his mind.

03:56.497 --> 03:57.889
That's a man with a problem,

03:57.933 --> 04:00.544
and if I don't know
what it is, I can't fix it.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.372
- It's not that kind
of a problem.

04:02.416 --> 04:05.027
- Whether you like it or not,
you know why he brought me in.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.638
- It's not that kind
of a problem.

04:19.128 --> 04:22.392
Stephanie Novak has MS.

04:22.436 --> 04:23.611
- How long have they known?

04:23.654 --> 04:24.786
- She was diagnosed
a few years ago.

04:24.829 --> 04:25.961
She just had a relapse.

04:26.004 --> 04:28.355
He's taking her in
for more tests.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.660
- Who else besides you knows?

04:29.704 --> 04:30.748
- What difference
does it make?

04:30.792 --> 04:32.402
- They're gonna
find out, Keri,

04:32.446 --> 04:34.839
like they found out
about bringing me in.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.624
- Please don't tell me
how to do my job.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.103
I know what I'm--
this is what she wants.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.453
This is what his wife wants.

04:39.496 --> 04:40.802
I don't know
what else to tell you.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.630
Stop asking questions,
and don't make this,

04:42.673 --> 04:44.414
or anything else going on,
your business.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.894
If we have any hope
of coexisting

04:45.937 --> 04:47.287
while the mayor is gone,

04:47.330 --> 04:51.029
I need you not to turn this
into a pissing contest.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.105
- Jessica, I wasn't
expecting you.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.280
Shouldn't you be at work?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.369
- I'm not playing hooky.
I promise.

05:26.413 --> 05:32.157
- Well, as long as I'm not
harboring a truant, come on in.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.377
Angela's just finishing up
a graveyard.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.900
She should be home
pretty soon.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.381
- Actually, I wanted
to talk to you first.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.296
I know you have
90 days to move,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.864
but have you given any thought
to where you want to live?

05:42.907 --> 05:44.474
- Well, with everything
going on,

05:44.518 --> 05:47.434
we haven't had a chance.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.957
Reverend Thompson
from my church said

05:49.000 --> 05:51.176
he might drop by
with a few ideas,

05:51.220 --> 05:53.091
or a prayer.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.224
- Well, before you seek
divine intervention,

05:55.267 --> 05:57.531
come with me.

06:01.143 --> 06:04.146
I want you to take
a look at this.

06:06.017 --> 06:10.021
It's a house I want to buy
for you, Angela, and the boys.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.459
It's in Evanston.
Great schools.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.591
A big backyard
for Cory and Mark.

06:14.635 --> 06:17.246
- Jessica, this is too much.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.247
- Not for me.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.944
I have plenty of money

06:19.988 --> 06:22.251
with no one to spend it on
but myself,

06:22.294 --> 06:23.426
and to be honest,

06:23.470 --> 06:24.601
after everything
that's happened,

06:24.645 --> 06:26.386
that's the least I can do.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.173
- Evanston.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.566
- Well, it doesn't
have to be this house,

06:32.609 --> 06:34.481
or this neighborhood.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.874
We can all
go looking together.

06:36.918 --> 06:39.094
- You want to go
house hunting with Angela?

06:39.137 --> 06:40.225
- Mm-hmm.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.010
- We're talking
about the woman

06:42.053 --> 06:44.578
who wouldn't even accept
a bag of groceries from you.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.928
- Which is why
I'm coming to you first.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.364
- And you think
she listens to me?

06:48.408 --> 06:49.539
- If you can convince her

06:49.583 --> 06:52.542
that it's a better life
for her boys,

06:52.586 --> 06:54.326
she might.

06:54.370 --> 06:57.373
- I'll try.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.549
But I'm not
making any promises.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.159
- That's all I can ask.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.515
- You must be Jessica.

07:08.558 --> 07:11.039
I'm James Thompson.
I'm your aunt's pastor.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.519
- Oh.

07:12.562 --> 07:15.043
Wow, that's, uh, very sweet
of her to mention me.

07:15.086 --> 07:16.653
- Oh, she did more than that.

07:16.697 --> 07:20.527
She prayed for you for years,
and here you are.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.529
- Well, she and I have a lot
to catch up on.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.052
- Yeah, well, no better place
to do it

07:24.095 --> 07:25.662
than with the family of God.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.534
I can save you
a seat on Sunday?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.492
- Oh, that's
very kind of you,

07:29.536 --> 07:30.667
but I think I'll start
with finding her

07:30.711 --> 07:31.668
a new place to live.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.235
- Well, look at us.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.237
We're on the same page.
That's why I'm here.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.066
Knocking on doors,
seeing who I can help.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.197
- Do you know everyone
in the building?

07:39.241 --> 07:41.373
- Well, I wouldn't be
much of a pastor

07:41.417 --> 07:43.201
if I didn't make it
my business to know

07:43.245 --> 07:45.987
everything that's going on
in the neighborhood.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.989
Well, it's been a pleasure
meeting you, Jessica.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.469
You have a wonderful day.
- Thank you.

07:49.512 --> 07:53.037
Um, I'm sorry, um...

07:53.081 --> 07:55.170
Did you know Carl Jeffries?

07:57.302 --> 07:58.695
- I did, yes.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.131
- What about the way he died?

08:00.175 --> 08:03.091
Do you know anything
about that?

08:03.134 --> 08:05.310
I work for the mayor,
Reverend Thompson.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.529
I'm not with the police.

08:09.619 --> 08:12.535
- Carl was a good man,
but he made bad choices.

08:12.579 --> 08:16.278
Filing that lawsuit was his way
of trying to make things right.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.540
He was out front,

08:17.584 --> 08:20.108
he was telling people
about their rights.

08:20.151 --> 08:23.198
Then all of a sudden,
he just drops the lawsuit.

08:23.241 --> 08:26.723
A few days later, he shows up
with a brand new Range Rover.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.595
Then he got shot.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.118
- Did Carl have
the kind of money

08:30.161 --> 08:32.468
to buy a car like that?

08:32.512 --> 08:35.645
- No, I wouldn't think so.
Not normally.

08:42.696 --> 08:46.221
That's all I know, ma'am.
- Thank you.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.754
- I come in peace.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.321
- Listen, Lloyd,
about earlier--

08:59.364 --> 09:00.452
- Say no more.

09:00.496 --> 09:01.541
I was out of line

09:01.584 --> 09:03.107
to bring that up
in front of everyone.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.631
- It's not that you brought
it up in front of everyone.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.284
I know what you want,
and naming a street

09:06.328 --> 09:09.418
after Fred Hampton
is not gonna fly.

09:09.461 --> 09:12.726
- Why, because you're a proxy
for the police department?

09:12.769 --> 09:15.250
- So much for coming in peace.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.643
- The man was
a civil rights activist

09:16.686 --> 09:18.340
and a hero, Keri.

09:18.383 --> 09:21.082
- And to others,
a dangerous militant.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.650
- The Black Panthers were
about defending themselves

09:23.693 --> 09:25.390
from government oppression.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.088
- Lloyd, please, I am not here
to litigate his case.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.437
- It's already been litigated,

09:28.480 --> 09:30.178
about 30 years
before you were born,

09:30.221 --> 09:31.658
and a white judge
threw it out.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.269
- And his family also got
over a million dollars,

09:34.312 --> 09:35.705
and if I'm not mistaken,
there's a statue.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.185
- In Maywood.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.100
They already know
who he is in Maywood.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.319
I want the rest of this city
to know who he is

09:41.363 --> 09:43.191
before he's
completely forgotten.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.627
- Lloyd,
it's a hot-button issue,

09:44.671 --> 09:45.802
and Bobby doesn't want
any part of it.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.543
- Bobby's not here, is he?

09:47.587 --> 09:50.372
- No, but I am.
- Don't you mean, no, but I am?

09:50.415 --> 09:52.113
- If you're thinking
of pushing this through

09:52.156 --> 09:54.637
while Bobby's gone,
I strongly advise against it.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.379
- Well.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.076
We all have a job
to do, Keri.

10:06.867 --> 10:09.260
- Hey, whatever you have
going on, stop it.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.305
We have a problem.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.220
- Good.
I'm running out of ways

10:12.263 --> 10:13.482
to say the mayor is attending
to personal business.

10:13.525 --> 10:14.570
What's going on?

10:14.614 --> 10:15.658
- Our esteemed deputy mayor

10:15.702 --> 10:17.181
won't take no for an answer.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.400
- Fred Hampton again.

10:18.443 --> 10:19.706
- Yes.
It's his day to shine,

10:19.749 --> 10:21.229
so he wants to be
front and center.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.622
- Why don't we just
throw the guy a bone?

10:22.665 --> 10:24.667
- I agree.
That's why I'm coming to you.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.582
- Thought you said Bobby
wasn't in favor of it.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.715
- There's nothing to be in
favor of if Lloyd is kept busy.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.325
- Shit, Keri.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.587
- This is not
a request, Derrick.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.110
- I don't want to string
the guy along.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.460
He's old, and I'm already lying
to the press.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.245
Why can't we just be straight
with people?

10:37.288 --> 10:38.507
- Do you know where you work?

10:38.550 --> 10:40.683
Wrestle with
your conscience later.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.599
- I do.
Every day.

10:52.608 --> 10:56.612
Just was checking on Joyce.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.874
Poor thing.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.398
She just keeps
mixing up her medicines.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.618
- What's this?

11:02.662 --> 11:06.448
- It's, um, uh--
a house for sale in Evanston.

11:06.491 --> 11:07.449
- I can see that.

11:07.492 --> 11:08.885
You work for Century 21 now,

11:08.929 --> 11:11.758
or did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

11:11.801 --> 11:15.283
- Jessica wants
to buy it for us.

11:15.326 --> 11:18.721
- She wants to buy us
a house in Evanston.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.636
- Well, they have
great schools.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.204
Look.
Big yard for the boys.

11:23.247 --> 11:27.164
- Yeah, that'll solve
everything, won't it?

11:27.208 --> 11:28.600
- Angela.
- I'm serious.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.602
Got a problem?
Write a check.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.821
That's Jessica.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.302
- You are working
double shifts,

11:34.345 --> 11:36.652
talking about nursing school.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.914
Don't you want to stop worrying

11:37.958 --> 11:39.611
about keeping a roof
over your head?

11:39.655 --> 11:41.483
- Of course I do.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.441
Why don't you see that's why
I'm working double shifts

11:43.485 --> 11:44.791
and going to school?

11:44.834 --> 11:47.489
I want to buy the house
for you and the boys.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.447
I do.
Not her.

11:49.491 --> 11:52.276
- Baby, you know how proud
of you I am

11:52.320 --> 11:53.582
and how hard
you work for us.

11:53.625 --> 11:54.801
- Then you know
it doesn't mean shit

11:54.844 --> 11:56.585
if she can just swoop in here
with her money.

12:00.284 --> 12:03.548
I'm sorry.

12:03.592 --> 12:06.682
Ma, thank Jessica for me.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.597
I know she's trying.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.818
Tell her we're
gonna have to pass.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.218
- Keri, how's
"mayor for the day"

12:21.262 --> 12:22.524
treating you?

12:22.567 --> 12:24.265
- I never want to hear
those words again.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.570
What's on your mind, Jessica?

12:27.398 --> 12:29.749
- Carl Jeffries.

12:29.792 --> 12:30.880
- What about him?

12:30.924 --> 12:32.534
- I just recently learned

12:32.577 --> 12:34.231
he came into some money
before he died.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.450
I was wondering if you
knew anything about that.

12:35.493 --> 12:36.756
- "Recently learned"?

12:36.799 --> 12:37.800
I know you're looking
for something to do,

12:37.844 --> 12:39.454
but what are you doing?

12:39.497 --> 12:41.282
- The man who sued the city
before my aunt did

12:41.325 --> 12:42.936
was shot three times.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.286
I'm just trying
to find out why.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.636
- I'm sure there's
no danger to your aunt.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.029
- How do you know?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.770
- Because Carl Jeffries
and your aunt

12:50.813 --> 12:52.859
didn't travel
in the same circles.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.686
- What does that mean?

12:54.730 --> 12:57.515
- It means that Carl Jeffries
was anything but an angel,

12:57.559 --> 13:00.431
and he could've come into money
any number of illegal ways.

13:00.475 --> 13:01.911
- That's a theory,
but the reality

13:01.955 --> 13:02.956
is he came into money

13:02.999 --> 13:04.261
after he dropped the lawsuit

13:04.305 --> 13:07.569
against North Park.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.310
- I don't think I like
what you're implying.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.965
- Only two parties benefitted
from him walking away:

13:12.008 --> 13:13.880
Pat McGann
and the city of Chicago.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.446
- Well, I can only speak
for the city,

13:15.490 --> 13:17.884
and I don't bribe people
to drop lawsuits.

13:17.927 --> 13:18.928
Are we done?

13:18.972 --> 13:20.451
- That's all I wanted to know.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.028
- Hey.
You busy?

13:32.072 --> 13:33.073
- Very.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.031
I'm letting Toys R Us know

13:35.075 --> 13:36.250
I can be
at their new grand opening

13:36.293 --> 13:38.861
in Skokie on Tuesday.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.298
That's my way of saying no,
I'm not busy.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.040
Just wanted to let you know

13:44.084 --> 13:45.215
Keri and I discussed
your proposal,

13:45.259 --> 13:46.869
and she had a change of heart.

13:46.913 --> 13:50.264
- Let me guess.
You changed her heart.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.005
- This one's on her.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.571
To be honest, I don't know much
about the man.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.138
- You're born
and raised in Chicago?

13:55.182 --> 13:56.139
- Yes, sir.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.185
- You went to college?

13:58.228 --> 13:59.403
- Yes, I did.

13:59.447 --> 14:02.493
- You are black, right?

14:02.537 --> 14:04.408
- Last time I checked.
- You see?

14:04.452 --> 14:07.934
This is exactly why we need
to name a street after him.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.240
If someone like you doesn't
know Fred's story--

14:10.284 --> 14:14.462
- Is that you and--
- Bobby Kennedy.

14:14.505 --> 14:17.247
The minute I heard he was
running in the Indiana primary,

14:17.291 --> 14:21.164
I drove three hours and got
myself down there to help.

14:21.208 --> 14:25.255
Nicest man.
He took pictures with everyone.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.910
- You were in Vietnam.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.825
- Yes, I was.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.219
You don't know how lucky
you are not to have a draft.

14:34.569 --> 14:38.442
Okay.
All right.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.923
Let's make a plan.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.533
I can schedule a meeting
with the City Council--

14:42.577 --> 14:43.926
- We'll get to that.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.929
First things first, protocol.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.062
- At my age, when somebody
says protocol,

14:49.105 --> 14:50.193
they're jerking my chain.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.194
What's going on, Derrick?

14:51.238 --> 14:52.935
- You need signatures

14:52.979 --> 14:55.590
for 2/3 of the residents
on the street you have in mind.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.331
I'm not jerking
your chain, Lloyd.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.550
The only way Keri's willing
to go along with it

14:59.594 --> 15:00.987
is if it's
a true grassroots effort

15:01.030 --> 15:02.205
that shields the mayor.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.990
- Then tomorrow we canvass.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.866
- Hey, it's an active
work site.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.172
Put it on.

15:12.215 --> 15:15.915
- I've got a hard head.
Ask my brothers.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.960
- It's been a while, Keri.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.396
What brings you down here?

15:19.440 --> 15:20.963
- Jessica Pearson.

15:21.007 --> 15:24.358
- Ah, my favorite person.
What's she done now?

15:24.401 --> 15:27.143
- Nothing, except she's looking
into the Carl Jeffries case.

15:27.187 --> 15:29.058
- I never met the man.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.973
- So you weren't the one that
paid him off to drop the suit?

15:31.017 --> 15:33.062
- All right, get off
your high horse.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.324
Okay, you were
popping champagne

15:34.368 --> 15:35.586
the second that suit
went away.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.284
How do you think that happens?

15:37.327 --> 15:39.112
Someone, what,
sprinkles fairy dust?

15:39.155 --> 15:40.243
- So who gave him the money?

15:40.287 --> 15:41.941
- None of your
fucking business.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.464
- If it's Bobby's brother,
it's my business,

15:43.507 --> 15:44.987
because that traces
back to the mayor,

15:45.031 --> 15:46.554
and it's my job
to protect him.

15:46.597 --> 15:50.906
- As city attorney
or his girlfriend?

15:50.950 --> 15:54.388
And where the hell
is Bobby anyway?

15:54.431 --> 15:57.434
Has he got some side piece
out of town,

15:57.478 --> 16:00.220
or is that another question
you don't ask?

16:00.263 --> 16:03.179
- I don't know what you have
on Bobby or his brother,

16:03.223 --> 16:07.096
but if you think you have
something on me, you're wrong.

16:10.621 --> 16:13.537
- Hey, you sure you don't want
to hold onto this, sweetie?

16:13.581 --> 16:16.584
You never know when something
might fall out of the sky.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.282
- Please state your full name
for the record.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.241
- Carl Anthony Jeffries.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.373
- And where is your current
address, Mr. Jeffries?

16:23.417 --> 16:26.463
- You know where I live.
I stay in the projects.

16:26.507 --> 16:29.336
- You mean North Park?
- Yeah, North Park's my home.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.294
And I don't want them
tearing it down

16:31.338 --> 16:33.383
unless they're gonna give us
someplace else to live.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.037
- You say it's your home,
but you haven't actually lived

16:35.081 --> 16:37.126
in that building
your whole life, have you?

16:37.170 --> 16:38.693
- Mostly, yeah.

16:38.736 --> 16:42.349
- Okay, what about
from 2012 to 2016?

16:42.392 --> 16:44.481
Where'd you live
during those years?

16:46.570 --> 16:48.137
- Joliet.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.618
- Joliet Correctional Center.
- Yeah.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.402
- You were serving
a four-year sentence

16:52.446 --> 16:53.751
for writing bad checks,
weren't you?

16:53.795 --> 16:55.318
- I did my time.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.103
- Yeah, but you're still
in debt to a lot of people.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.061
- That has nothing
to do with any of this.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.671
- Is this a bad time?

17:00.715 --> 17:02.412
- It's okay.
Come on in, Yoli.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.588
- Uh, you got some calls
while you were out before.

17:04.632 --> 17:07.983
A Jeff Malone called
from sunny Miami.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.072
When's he gonna put
a ring on it?

17:10.116 --> 17:11.334
- Is that the message?

17:11.378 --> 17:13.075
- No, I was just wondering.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.512
I mean, he and I
started talking,

17:15.556 --> 17:18.211
and he's definitely
missing you.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.777
I mean, he didn't come right
out and say it that way,

17:19.821 --> 17:22.041
but after 45 minutes,
I got it out of him--

17:22.084 --> 17:23.651
- Yoli...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

17:23.694 --> 17:27.394
I am not good with boundaries.
- Get good.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.613
Yeah?
Okay, anything else?

17:29.657 --> 17:31.093
- Yeah, your
aunt Lillian called.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.355
She wanted to talk
about the house.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.356
Do you want me
to set that up?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.141
- No, I'll handle it.

17:35.184 --> 17:36.751
- Is she taking it?

17:36.794 --> 17:38.666
It's a sweet place.

17:39.667 --> 17:43.584
That's right.
It's none of my business.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.020
Okay.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.369
- Good night, Yoli.

17:46.413 --> 17:49.633
- Night.

18:01.558 --> 18:03.473
- I'm on the clock.
What's the emergency?

18:03.517 --> 18:06.259
- How are you on the clock?
Your brother's out of town.

18:06.302 --> 18:09.131
- He's not the only one
I drive for these days.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.655
- You stupid son of a bitch.

18:11.699 --> 18:12.656
- Bobby thought it'd be
a good idea

18:12.700 --> 18:13.744
to keep an eye on her.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.311
- Well, open
your fucking eyes then.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.486
- What are you talking about?

18:16.530 --> 18:18.358
I've been
with the woman all day.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.186
She's literally
having tea with her aunt.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.057
- Where?
At my site?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.711
You know what
she's doing there?

18:23.754 --> 18:25.234
She's digging
into the Jeffries mess.

18:25.278 --> 18:26.844
She knows you paid him off.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.672
- How do you know that?

18:28.716 --> 18:30.848
- Because your brother's little
girlfriend told me, that's how.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.502
- What do you want me
to do about it now, Pat?

18:32.546 --> 18:35.157
- Well, just keep your distance
from her for a while.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.637
- I can't do that.
- Yeah, you can.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.160
And I got a job for you.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.119
- I told you.
I'm not your bagman anymore.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.164
- It's just security.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.601
Okay, I got a VIP coming
into town who needs protection.

18:44.645 --> 18:47.169
He's a real whale.
You can name your price.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.431
- Not interested.

18:48.475 --> 18:49.780
- Oh, is that her?

18:49.824 --> 18:52.392
- I have a job.
Get yourself a mall cop.

18:52.435 --> 18:55.177
- You think this is a joke?
Wake up.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.570
You're not keeping
an eye on her.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.528
She's keeping
an eye on you.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.813
- You didn't have to come in.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.598
- I want to talk to you.

19:24.641 --> 19:25.947
- Okay, talk.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.992
- You got questions for me,
ask away.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.603
You wanted me
to drive you around

19:29.646 --> 19:30.691
so you could find out
some shit about me.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.171
So let's get to it.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.563
- You sure you
don't want a lawyer?

19:33.607 --> 19:35.086
- I don't need a lawyer.
Why are you looking into me?

19:35.130 --> 19:37.176
- What do you do
for Pat McGann?

19:37.219 --> 19:39.221
I knew you worked for him
the minute I met you.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.049
The mayor doesn't send
his top guy

19:41.092 --> 19:42.224
to scare people
in the dead of night.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.791
Not even this mayor.

19:43.834 --> 19:44.879
- Good for you.
You cracked the code.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.359
I moonlight.
So what?

19:46.402 --> 19:48.839
- Does Bobby know about it?
- Yes, he does.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.755
Does he know I paid
Carl Jeffries to drop the suit?

19:51.799 --> 19:52.930
No, he doesn't.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.367
- What about
what happened next?

19:54.410 --> 19:56.760
Does he know about that?
- No, he doesn't know,

19:56.804 --> 19:58.762
and neither do I, because
the last time I saw that guy,

19:58.806 --> 20:04.246
I gave him an envelope
filled with $50,000 in cash.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.030
Jesus Christ.
You don't believe me, do you?

20:06.074 --> 20:07.075
- I saw you throw
that union kid

20:07.118 --> 20:08.119
up against the wall.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.643
- You're basing this on that?

20:09.686 --> 20:11.210
- No, I'm basing it
on things not adding up.

20:11.253 --> 20:14.038
- Goddamn it.
I just admitted I paid the guy.

20:14.082 --> 20:15.910
Why the hell would I kill him
after he dropped the suit?

20:15.953 --> 20:18.782
- From what I can gather, Carl
liked money and was in debt.

20:18.826 --> 20:21.611
Maybe he saw you as an ATM,
wanted more.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.047
- Fuck you.
- That's not an answer.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.658
- You want an answer?
Here's an answer.

20:24.701 --> 20:27.922
If you really think
I'm capable of murder,

20:27.965 --> 20:29.271
get yourself another driver.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.105
- That's another one
for me, old man.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.281
- You tired?

20:39.325 --> 20:43.154
No, no.
Just--just thinking.

20:43.198 --> 20:47.333
- About the good old days
of canvassing the neighborhood?

20:47.376 --> 20:49.683
Taking a horse and buggy
to pick up a pop.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.859
No.

20:51.902 --> 20:55.254
About Fred.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.125
- Why is this so important
to you?

20:57.168 --> 21:00.128
- I've been telling you that.
The man made a difference.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.347
He deserves recognition.

21:01.390 --> 21:05.133
- No, you told me
why it's important.

21:05.176 --> 21:07.309
Why is it important to you?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.445
- Fred and I grew up together.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.055
- In Maywood?

21:14.098 --> 21:17.145
- Yes, in Maywood.

21:17.188 --> 21:20.279
There used to be white people
there a great many years ago.

21:22.193 --> 21:24.326
- Were you guys tight?

21:24.370 --> 21:27.242
- We were very good friends.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.766
Played baseball together
at Proviso.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.855
- No shit.
- Mm-hmm.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.074
He actually wanted
to be a lawyer.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.989
You believe that?

21:35.032 --> 21:36.338
He only joined
the Black Panthers

21:36.382 --> 21:38.993
so he could keep an eye
on police brutality.

21:40.255 --> 21:42.431
He never wanted
to hurt anybody.

21:44.128 --> 21:46.392
- What happened with him
and the police?

21:46.435 --> 21:47.436
- First of all, it wasn't
the police.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.308
It was the FBI.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.224
And it was an ambush.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.402
They shot him in his bed.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.230
And when the first one
didn't kill him,

21:59.274 --> 22:01.842
they put two more
in his head.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.326
- Damn.

22:07.369 --> 22:10.067
- The saddest part is that

22:10.111 --> 22:13.201
I actually spoke to him
that day.

22:13.244 --> 22:15.769
I had tickets for a game
and I thought...

22:18.424 --> 22:24.038
But by that time, it wasn't
good to be seen with me.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.783
It wasn't good for me,
he said.

22:39.053 --> 22:43.057
- So this is where you work?

22:43.100 --> 22:45.189
- Hi.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.410
- And you see the mayor?

22:48.454 --> 22:51.805
- I wish he was here today.
I want you to meet him.

22:51.848 --> 22:53.894
So you ready for lunch?

22:53.937 --> 22:56.070
- One minute.
Okay?

22:56.113 --> 22:57.854
- Okay.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.424
Angela said no to the house,
didn't she?

23:02.468 --> 23:04.992
- Well, we, uh--
want to find a place

23:05.035 --> 23:08.474
close by that we could afford
on our own.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.258
- You know, I shouldn't have
dropped that lawsuit.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.477
- Oh, Jessica, please--

23:11.520 --> 23:13.522
- No, condo projects
fall apart all the time.

23:13.566 --> 23:15.263
I should've fought harder.

23:15.306 --> 23:17.570
- Why, so you or I could end up
like that poor man?

23:17.613 --> 23:19.441
Uh-uh.

23:19.485 --> 23:22.313
Angela warned me about getting
mixed up with those people.

23:22.357 --> 23:25.404
It's best this thing is over,
one way or another.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.407
- What people, Lillian?

23:30.496 --> 23:33.368
- Um...
- You said she warned you

23:33.412 --> 23:35.326
about getting mixed up
with those people.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.807
What people?

23:37.851 --> 23:39.026
The developer?

23:39.069 --> 23:40.984
- I don't know.
I just...

23:41.028 --> 23:42.377
- What is it?

23:42.421 --> 23:45.554
The whole thing.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.515
When I saw that picture of Carl
at your apartment,

23:49.558 --> 23:51.299
it gave me nightmares.

23:54.520 --> 23:58.088
- I'm sorry.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.960
I shouldn't have
brought it up.

24:09.056 --> 24:10.840
There is no quit in you.

24:10.884 --> 24:13.408
I'll give you that.
- That is true.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.149
But this isn't
about the house.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.846
- Oh, yeah?
What's it about?

24:16.890 --> 24:18.065
Did you get us a cabin
in the Dells?

24:18.108 --> 24:19.588
- No, it's about Carl Jeffries.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.853
- What about him?

24:23.897 --> 24:25.159
- Why didn't you want
your mother

24:25.202 --> 24:26.552
taking up the lawsuit
after him?

24:26.595 --> 24:29.163
- The man died, Jessica,
and I didn't know why.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.512
I just didn't want my mother
anywhere near it.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.166
- Well, your mother also said

24:32.209 --> 24:35.038
you didn't want her getting
mixed up with those people.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.257
- Well, my mother
doesn't always

24:36.300 --> 24:37.519
remember things
the way they happen.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.390
- Angela, please.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.088
- I don't understand
what you're trying to do.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.524
- It's possible that the man

24:42.568 --> 24:43.612
that is putting you
and your family

24:43.656 --> 24:45.179
out on the street

24:45.222 --> 24:47.224
is the same man that put
Carl Jeffries in the ground.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.141
Now I need to know.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.535
- I don't.
- This isn't for you.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.232
It's for me.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.628
It won't get back to you.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.195
I promise.

25:03.066 --> 25:04.981
- Do you know who
the Four Corner Royals are?

25:05.025 --> 25:06.983
- I'm guessing they're
not a softball team.

25:07.027 --> 25:10.509
- No, they operate
out of this place on Marquette.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.032
I heard they had something
to do with it.

25:12.075 --> 25:14.469
I don't want to say any more.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.167
- You don't have to.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.604
Thank you.

25:20.388 --> 25:21.563
- Where are you going?

25:21.607 --> 25:22.564
- I think you know
where I'm going.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.218
- Are you out of your mind?

25:24.261 --> 25:26.525
- I'm from New York.
I've represented criminals.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.178
- Okay, well,
this isn't your New York

25:28.222 --> 25:30.267
or your criminals.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.401
I'll take you.
- So it's too dangerous for me,

25:33.444 --> 25:34.663
but okay for you.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.578
- I grew up with these people,
all right?

25:36.622 --> 25:38.580
I know how to approach them.

25:38.624 --> 25:41.452
- And you'd do that for me?

25:41.496 --> 25:43.193
- I mean, you did offer to buy
my family a whole house--

25:43.237 --> 25:44.717
- And you said no.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.589
- Well, what if
I change my mind?

25:47.633 --> 25:50.200
Wouldn't do me any good
if you're dead.

25:50.244 --> 25:51.593
- I don't know what to say.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.943
- Just follow my lead.

25:53.987 --> 25:56.293
And try to look
a little less...you know.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.429
- I can do that.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.046
- Nice office etiquette.

26:10.090 --> 26:11.526
What happened to you?

26:11.570 --> 26:13.746
Lloyd happened to me.

26:13.789 --> 26:17.488
Been out getting signatures
with him all day.

26:17.532 --> 26:20.579
- God, they're going to rename
the street after Fred Hampton?

26:20.622 --> 26:21.623
That's amazing.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.494
- It's also not true.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.018
- What do you mean?

26:25.061 --> 26:26.802
- Can't believe I'm
even saying this, but...

26:26.846 --> 26:28.630
- What?

26:28.674 --> 26:31.981
- We're just stringing him
along until Bobby gets back.

26:32.025 --> 26:33.417
- How could you be so cruel
to such a nice man?

26:33.461 --> 26:34.941
- I feel terrible.

26:34.984 --> 26:36.812
- Yeah, well, why don't you
just give him what he wants?

26:36.856 --> 26:38.379
He's been in City Hall
for 100 years.

26:38.422 --> 26:40.120
- Fred Hampton was
a Black Panther.

26:40.163 --> 26:41.817
When white people
hear Black Panther,

26:41.861 --> 26:43.558
they think killer, anarchist--

26:43.602 --> 26:45.647
- Marvel movie.

26:45.691 --> 26:48.607
- I'm serious.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.173
It sucks.
- Yeah, well, if you think it--

26:50.217 --> 26:51.784
You know what?

26:51.827 --> 26:53.089
Nothing.
Forget it.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.830
- What do you mean nothing?
Talk.

26:54.874 --> 26:56.919
- I've been told I have
a problem with boundaries,

26:56.963 --> 26:57.920
so I'll shut up.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.835
- Are you for real?

26:59.879 --> 27:03.056
Don't ever stop
speaking your mind.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.536
Just tell me what you think.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.758
- Don't just sit there
and whine.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.020
Be a man.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.892
If you think Keri's wrong,
tell her.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.676
Which Derrick
do you want to be:

27:14.720 --> 27:16.983
the ex-journalist who could
make a difference in the world,

27:17.026 --> 27:19.072

28:26.748 --> 28:29.055
- I work for Mayor Novak.

28:29.098 --> 28:31.492
- They're tearing our building
down to put up condos.

28:31.535 --> 28:32.754
Jessica's trying to stop it.

28:32.798 --> 28:36.584
You gonna stop a bulldozer?

28:36.627 --> 28:40.719
- I'm gonna try.
But I need some information.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.285
- Information.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.634
- Carl Jeffries.

28:44.810 --> 28:48.117
- I told her you might
know something.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.772
- I don't know
nothing about that.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.948
Sorry you came all the way
down here from City Hall.

- I'm not with the police.

29:12.707 --> 29:14.143
- No, you're not.
You're with the mayor.

29:14.187 --> 29:15.971
What's he going to do for us?

29:16.015 --> 29:17.930
Make another speech about
breaking the cycle of violence?

29:20.846 --> 29:22.543
- You're right.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.545
The mayor's
not gonna do shit for you.

29:24.588 --> 29:29.115
But if you help me out today,
I'll remember that.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.341
- Where do you get off coming
in here, making promises?

29:38.385 --> 29:40.126
- Kevin, remember
when John-John

29:40.169 --> 29:41.997
came to the ER
with a bullet in his leg?

29:42.041 --> 29:43.042
Who lost his paperwork

29:43.085 --> 29:44.826
so the cops couldn't find him,
huh?

29:44.870 --> 29:45.827
You owe me.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.177
- Yeah, maybe so.

29:48.221 --> 29:49.831
But I don't owe her
and I don't know her.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.181
- She's my cousin.
I'm vouching for her.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.836
- How come I never
seen her before?

29:54.880 --> 29:56.882
- She's from the bougie branch
of the family.

29:56.925 --> 29:59.145
You think they come visit us?

30:16.249 --> 30:18.860
- I meant no disrespect.

30:18.904 --> 30:21.210
I'm just trying to find out
what happened to Carl.

30:21.254 --> 30:24.779
- Carl owed some dealers a lot
of cash that he couldn't pay.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.260
Then he started pushing
a new whip.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.827
They came to collect.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.743
- It's that simple?

30:32.787 --> 30:35.007
- That's what I heard.

30:39.881 --> 30:42.231
- Let's go.

30:59.683 --> 31:02.077
- Eyes forward.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.038
Girl, what were you
thinking in there?

31:06.081 --> 31:07.082
What were you gonna do?

31:08.954 --> 31:09.911
- Pepper spray?

31:11.347 --> 31:13.915
Did you really think
that was going to help us?

31:13.959 --> 31:16.787
Okay, go.

31:16.831 --> 31:21.270
- 612 signatures
in one day.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.142
- Wow.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.273
- Thank you.

31:24.317 --> 31:25.884
- Two more days
at this pace,

31:25.927 --> 31:27.059
and we should be ready
to petition City Council.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.451
- I get it.

31:28.495 --> 31:29.757
You went above and beyond
to help me.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.063
It won't be forgotten.

31:31.106 --> 31:33.152
- No offense,
but I'm not doing it for you.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.197
I'm doing it for Lloyd.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.720
- You're not
actually suggesting

31:36.764 --> 31:37.983
that we give in
to him, are you?

31:38.026 --> 31:39.288
- Why not?
- The police department

31:39.332 --> 31:41.334
will fry Bobby
if he backs this.

31:41.377 --> 31:43.292
- You keep saying Bobby,
but you also mean you.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.947
Just say it.
Take a stand.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.819
- I'm not taking a stand 'cause
it's a 50-year-old incident,

31:48.863 --> 31:50.952
and horrible mistakes
were made.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.040
Lloyd didn't need
to shove this down my throat

31:52.084 --> 31:53.302
while Bobby was away

31:53.346 --> 31:55.304
just so that he could get
what he wanted.

31:55.348 --> 31:56.349
He knew exactly
what he was doing,

31:56.392 --> 31:57.350
and it's disrespectful.

31:57.393 --> 31:58.786
- He knows what he's doing,

31:58.829 --> 31:59.874
but he never gets
a chance to do it.

31:59.918 --> 32:00.875
- Derrick, come on!

32:00.919 --> 32:02.268
- No, you come on.

32:02.311 --> 32:03.922
The guy was brought in
to counter Bobby's youth,

32:03.965 --> 32:05.227
and all he ever gets
is grand openings

32:05.271 --> 32:07.316
and pizza-eating contests?
That's bullshit.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.971
- Yeah, well, what do you
want me to do?

32:10.015 --> 32:11.059
- We're already lying
to everyone

32:11.103 --> 32:12.756
about where the mayor is.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.889
At least give this guy
the respect he deserves.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.475
- I owe you an apology.

32:35.518 --> 32:37.738
- That must've been
some bad L ride to work.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.218
- I know you didn't
kill Carl Jeffries.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.611
- Mm-hmm.
- I asked around.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.526
Turns out he was shot
because of an unpaid drug debt.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.180
- That would've
been my guess,

32:45.224 --> 32:46.921
but you had to do
what you had to do, right?

32:46.965 --> 32:48.662
- If I thought you were capable
of killing someone,

32:48.705 --> 32:50.794
I never would've gotten
in a car with you.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.318
- Bullshit.

32:52.361 --> 32:56.800
- I didn't say you had nothing
to do with it.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.846
I just needed to know you had
nothing to do with his death,

32:58.889 --> 33:00.326
and now I know.

33:00.369 --> 33:03.851
- Yeah, well, I may not have
put a bullet in his head,

33:03.894 --> 33:05.331
but I wouldn't exactly say

33:05.374 --> 33:07.289
I had nothing
to do with his death.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.030
- You didn't kill him, Nick.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.901
Carl Jeffries was mixed up
with a lot of bad people.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.512
- You don't think I know that?

33:12.555 --> 33:15.863
That's part of why
I gave him the money.

33:15.906 --> 33:17.952
At first, he was
a true believer.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.563
Said he wouldn't drop the suit
for a million bucks.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.610
But I know the guy's hurting
for cash, so I keep going back.

33:23.653 --> 33:24.959
I talked him into it

33:25.003 --> 33:27.309
because I could see
he wasn't a terrible guy,

33:27.353 --> 33:30.704
and I told him to take
that money, and go somewhere.

33:30.747 --> 33:33.272
Get the hell out,
and start over.

33:33.315 --> 33:36.362
I actually thought
I was doing him a favor.

33:36.405 --> 33:37.798
Goddamn idiot.

33:37.841 --> 33:40.757
Instead he buys a car.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.022
- I'm sorry about
what happened to that man,

33:44.065 --> 33:45.806
but I'm worried
about the mayor.

33:45.849 --> 33:49.027
- This won't go back on him.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.245
- Anything else
you want to tell me

33:50.289 --> 33:52.508
about what you
do for McGann?

33:52.552 --> 33:54.902
- No.
That's it.

34:01.604 --> 34:04.346
- Ah, Miss Allen.
I was just coming to see you.

34:04.390 --> 34:05.695
That Derrick's a great kid.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.045
He really busted
his hump out there.

34:07.088 --> 34:09.090
Together we got
more than enough signatures

34:09.134 --> 34:12.311
to support a street name.

34:12.354 --> 34:13.747
- Unfortunately,
not where it counts:

34:13.790 --> 34:15.401
with the mayor.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.925
- I thought
that wasn't an issue.

34:17.968 --> 34:19.535
- I really want
to be straight with you.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.581
Um...

34:21.624 --> 34:25.933
Fred Hampton is a hero
to so many people,

34:25.976 --> 34:28.283
but not
to the police department.

34:28.327 --> 34:29.589
There's just
no way the mayor

34:29.632 --> 34:31.069
is gonna risk
antagonizing them.

34:31.112 --> 34:33.593
- So this was all bullshit,

34:33.636 --> 34:35.899
a way to keep me in line.
- I'm sorry.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.858
I should've handled it
differently,

34:37.901 --> 34:41.122
which is why I'm here so I can
tell you the truth about Bobby.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.081
- He's with his wife
at the Mayo Clinic.

34:43.124 --> 34:44.299
I know the truth.

34:44.343 --> 34:45.518
- Who told you?

34:45.561 --> 34:46.823
- I've been around
a long time, Keri.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.564
There's not a lot
goes on around here

34:48.608 --> 34:50.827
that I don't know about.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.005
- So then you know, uh,

34:55.049 --> 34:57.007
I'm not trying to pull
a power move on you.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.575
I'm really just trying
to protect the mayor.

34:59.619 --> 35:02.056
- You're loyal to Bobby.
I don't hold that against you.

35:05.538 --> 35:06.843
- For what it's worth,

35:06.887 --> 35:09.759
you really are
a great deputy mayor.

35:09.803 --> 35:10.891
People like you.

35:13.894 --> 35:17.854
- You want some advice
from an old hippie?

35:17.898 --> 35:20.074
- Sure.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.902
- Don't let your loyalty
to the mayor

35:21.945 --> 35:23.469
turn you into something
you'll hate.

35:25.645 --> 35:28.648
- Sounds a little more like
a warning than advice.

35:28.691 --> 35:30.389
- Let me put it this way then.

35:30.432 --> 35:33.392
Fred Hampton wanted
to lift people out of poverty.

35:33.435 --> 35:37.831
Pat McGann wants to push
the poor out of the city.

35:37.874 --> 35:39.137
Whose side are you on?

35:46.622 --> 35:48.015
- Hey, is it a bad time?

35:48.058 --> 35:50.496
- No, come on in.

35:50.539 --> 35:52.411
The boys were just cleaning
up after dinner,

35:52.454 --> 35:53.586
weren't you, boys?
both: Yep.

35:55.501 --> 35:56.676
- Hi.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.853
I just wanted to talk to you
about the house one last time.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.855
- Jessica--
- No, hear me out.

36:01.898 --> 36:03.639
You know how people
love to tell you

36:03.683 --> 36:06.033
that moving isn't gonna solve
your problems?

36:06.076 --> 36:09.428
Well, it's bullsh--
It's not true.

36:09.471 --> 36:11.952
- Thanks.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.214
- Moving to Chicago was

36:13.258 --> 36:15.477
the hardest thing
I've ever done,

36:15.521 --> 36:17.653
but I don't regret
one minute of it.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.525
- It's not about being
scared of change.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.831
I'm all about change.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.877
- You want to buy
this house yourself.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.878
- No.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.880
I have to.

36:26.923 --> 36:27.881
I know that sounds crazy.

36:27.924 --> 36:29.491
- No, not at all.

36:29.535 --> 36:31.754
No, I dreamt of having
my own law firm.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.887
They all said
I was crazy, too.

36:33.930 --> 36:35.149
- Oh, well, girl,
that is crazy.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.195
100%.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.022
- Jessica.
- Hey.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.895
I knew Pastor Thompson
would convince you.

36:41.938 --> 36:43.201
- What?

36:43.244 --> 36:45.072
- To come to church
with us tonight.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.247
Come on.
We don't want to be late.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.075
- No, I'm not much
of a churchgoer.

36:48.118 --> 36:49.685
No.

36:49.729 --> 36:52.210
- Sounds like you just haven't
found the right church yet.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.733
All right, boys.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.082
Cousin's coming to church
with us tonight.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.563
- She is?
- Yes.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.913
- Oh!

37:11.794 --> 37:14.928
Welcome to Chicago.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.277
The clubs as nice
in Shanghai?

37:16.321 --> 37:18.453
- I wouldn't know.
I'm in Macau now.

37:18.497 --> 37:19.889
- Oh, the Vegas of China.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.109
- I got office towers
already sold out.

37:22.152 --> 37:24.242
Here's to the same thing
happening in North Park.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.634
When are we breaking ground?

37:25.678 --> 37:27.636
- 90 days.

37:39.518 --> 37:42.608
- You told me it was going
to be bulldozed last week.

37:42.651 --> 37:44.087
- It's not up to me.
It's the city.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.741
- You said you had the mayor
in your pocket.

37:45.785 --> 37:46.960
- The mayor can't
do everything.

37:47.003 --> 37:48.309
- He can in Macau.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.702
Maybe I should just
keep my money there.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.181
- Come on.

37:51.225 --> 37:53.619
This is just a hiccup.

37:53.662 --> 37:55.708
We're gonna do great things,
you and I.

37:55.751 --> 37:57.144
Transform Chicago.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.235
I don't give a shit
about Chicago.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.542
I care about a return
on my investment.

38:03.585 --> 38:05.239
I want to see progress
on North Park this week,

38:05.283 --> 38:07.937
or I'm out.

38:14.988 --> 38:17.860
- I'm so happy
you could join us.

38:17.904 --> 38:18.861
- Thank you--

38:18.905 --> 38:20.210
Oh, excuse me.

38:20.254 --> 38:22.909
- Uh, you tell the mayor
you can't talk.

38:22.952 --> 38:23.910
You're in the house of God.

38:23.953 --> 38:24.998
- It's not the mayor,

38:25.041 --> 38:26.869
and I have to take this call.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.002
- We'll save you a seat,
but don't take too long.

38:29.045 --> 38:31.047
- Okay.
- Come on, boys.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.834
- You will never guess
where I am.

38:34.877 --> 38:37.837
- If it's not the lobby
of my hotel, I don't care.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.055
- Is that an invitation?

38:39.099 --> 38:40.143
- Eh, it's more like a plea.

38:40.187 --> 38:41.884
I'm still worried about you.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.844
- If it's what I think you're
worried about, don't be.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.759
My driver had nothing
to do with it.

38:46.802 --> 38:48.195
- Oh, well, then
we should celebrate

38:48.238 --> 38:49.979
with room service.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.199
- If this conversation
is going where I think it is,

38:52.242 --> 38:54.201
you should know I'm at church.

38:54.244 --> 38:55.550
- I think I've got
a bad connection.

38:55.594 --> 38:56.943
I thought you just
said "church."

38:58.074 --> 38:59.293
- What is happening up there?

38:59.337 --> 39:01.034
Am I gonna recognize you
when I get back?

39:01.077 --> 39:03.123
- Hurry up and finish
that trial.

39:03.166 --> 39:05.560
Come see for yourself.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.693
- Good evening.
all: Good evening.

39:07.736 --> 39:11.000
- May the grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ be with you.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.785
all: And also with you.

39:12.828 --> 39:15.614
- And the risen Christ
is with us.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.093
all: Praise the Lord.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.181
- Please be seated.

39:18.225 --> 39:21.097
all: Amen. Hallelujah.

39:26.276 --> 39:27.713
- Now we'll have
a wonderful song

39:27.756 --> 39:30.890
by Sister Angela.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.936
- ♪ There's

40:19.112 --> 40:21.941
- Bless me, Father.
For I have sinned.

40:21.984 --> 40:25.118
It's been a while
since my last confession.

40:25.161 --> 40:28.338
- Go ahead.

40:28.382 --> 40:31.298
- You can't tell anybody
about this, right?

40:31.341 --> 40:33.692
- The seal on the confessional
can never be broken.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.694
Whatever you say here

40:35.737 --> 40:37.957
I'll take to my grave.

It was my fault.

40:51.405 --> 40:53.189
- You said a man died.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.408
How?

40:54.452 --> 40:55.714
Did you intend
to take his life?

40:55.757 --> 40:57.324
- Does it matter?

40:57.367 --> 40:58.717
- Absolution requires

40:58.760 --> 41:01.328
an acceptance
of responsibility.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.722
What if his family
wants justice?

41:05.463 --> 41:08.335
I--I don't think I can do that.

41:08.378 --> 41:12.165
- Imagine I'm
this man's father, or son.

41:12.208 --> 41:15.690
Someone who loved him.

41:15.734 --> 41:18.954
What would you say to me?

41:18.998 --> 41:23.263
- I'd say I'm sorry.

41:23.306 --> 41:25.047
I know what I did.

41:28.181 --> 41:30.357
I took him from you.

41:32.751 --> 41:36.319
And you didn't even get
to put him in the ground

41:36.363 --> 41:38.452
to say good-bye.

41:43.892 --> 41:46.199
I'd say Tommy Diehl
didn't deserve to die.

41:55.121 --> 41:56.209

42:18.797 --> 42:21.277
Can the church say amen?
all: Amen.

42:40.296 --> 42:41.559
- Aaron.
Aaron!

42:43.299 --> 42:44.300
- Oy.
