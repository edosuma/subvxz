[man] Get a load of my next piece.

01:20.260 --> 01:23.970
"Ugly Christmas Sweaters of the Stars."
It's gonna be brilliant, I tell you.

01:24.060 --> 01:25.810
- [both laugh]
- Excuse me, Ron.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.810
- Uh, not now.
- No, this'll just take a second.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.980
I just had a couple of questions
about your article,

01:30.060 --> 01:31.730
the Fashion Week piece that I'm editing.

01:31.820 --> 01:33.780
Uh... go.

01:33.860 --> 01:36.820
Well, see, the thing is that Max wanted
300 words, and this is 650.

01:36.900 --> 01:39.660
And one of the designers you quoted
wasn't even on the floor, so...

01:39.740 --> 01:43.200
Amber, I don't have time
for this right now. Just clean it up.

01:43.290 --> 01:46.120
It's not just a clean-up,
it's a major rewrite.

01:46.210 --> 01:48.290
What are you, the executive editor now?

01:48.370 --> 01:51.710
- No, I'm just trying to explain that...
- Just fix it, okay?

01:55.880 --> 01:57.090
That went well.

01:57.170 --> 02:00.970
Let me guess. You're gonna rewrite
his stinky old article and save his butt.

02:01.050 --> 02:03.100
- Just like you always do.
- Well, it is my job.

02:03.180 --> 02:05.980
- You could tell him where to put it.
- I'm not telling him anything.

02:06.060 --> 02:09.229
Amber, we're junior editors, not writers.

02:09.310 --> 02:12.520
Well, how else am I supposed
to become a real journalist?

02:12.610 --> 02:14.780
- You'll get there.
- Of course you will.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.740
Five rejection letters in a month.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.860
Hardly killing it
on the freelance writing market.

02:18.950 --> 02:19.950
[phone beeps]

02:21.200 --> 02:23.910
[woman] Amber, Max wants to see you
in her office, now.

02:27.870 --> 02:28.710
Have fun.

02:31.790 --> 02:33.590
[receptionist] Now Beat Magazine,
how may I help you?

02:36.460 --> 02:39.380
If this is about Ron's article
about Fashion Week...

02:39.470 --> 02:41.930
Forget Fashion Week.
I got something else for you.

02:42.010 --> 02:43.510
Sit.

02:43.600 --> 02:47.850
So, what do you know
about the Royal Family of Aldovia?

02:47.930 --> 02:49.140
Aldovia?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.650
Wait, the king died last year,

02:52.730 --> 02:54.980
and the prince who's supposed to take over
is a total flake.

02:55.070 --> 02:57.150
Flake, international playboy,

02:57.230 --> 02:59.360
and scandalous socialite.

03:00.530 --> 03:03.160
Playboy Prince Richard took off
before Daddy died,

03:03.240 --> 03:04.830
which wouldn't be a problem,

03:04.910 --> 03:07.790
except they have this interregnum thing.

03:07.870 --> 03:10.410
- The time between two reigns?
- Right.

03:10.500 --> 03:15.420
In Aldovia, it's a maximum of a year,
which is about to expire.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.880
So, they need a butt in the big chair
by Christmas Day.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.550
But if the prince is MIA,
then what happens?

03:21.630 --> 03:24.220
That's exactly what you're gonna find out.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.510
His Royal Hotness
is due back this weekend.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.140
But just in case he abdicates,

03:28.220 --> 03:30.560
I need somebody there
to capture the fireworks.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.900
They got a press conference
scheduled for the 18th,

03:32.980 --> 03:35.110
and I need boots on the ground.

03:35.190 --> 03:38.730
I don't mean to shoot myself in the foot,
but why me?

03:38.820 --> 03:41.860
You're talented, hungry, smart.

03:41.950 --> 03:43.910
And none of my regular writers
can go this week.

03:45.950 --> 03:48.120
[woman] This guy is your assignment?

03:48.200 --> 03:49.620
[Amber] He thinks he's so hot.

03:49.700 --> 03:53.330
- [woman] Mm, another secret girlfriend.
- [Amber] Gross.

03:53.420 --> 03:56.290
- What a creep.
- [man] Chill out. He's like a 12.

03:56.380 --> 03:57.290
Not my type.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.880
- Honey, he's everyone's type.
- Not mine.

03:59.960 --> 04:03.840
If I set you up with one more hot,
successful guy who you blow off

04:03.930 --> 04:05.970
- I'm gonna punch you, girl.
- [man] Ouch.

04:06.050 --> 04:08.220
I'm just not on the market.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.310
You and Brian broke up, what, a year ago?

04:10.390 --> 04:11.770
You can't let him make you gun-shy.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.270
Can we just not talk about
my love life right now?

04:14.350 --> 04:18.019
Seriously, Amb, this assignment
could jumpstart your career.

04:35.460 --> 04:38.630
- Rudy, do we even need to say anything?
- The best.

04:38.710 --> 04:40.340
[Rudy] That's what we like to hear.

04:40.420 --> 04:42.050
[Amber sighs]

04:42.130 --> 04:43.420
Got my regular up?

04:43.510 --> 04:47.680
Yeah. We got a Coney Island bloodhound
and a blonde with sand.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.470
That'll be $4.95.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.640
Put it on my tab.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.600
- What, you think you're special?
- Maybe just a little bit.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.650
- Thanks, Pop.
- Okay.

04:57.730 --> 05:01.860
Hey, listen. Christmas Eve,
instead of doing our regular corn dogs,

05:01.940 --> 05:06.030
I was thinking maybe I'll make a big batch
of my famous five-alarm chili.

05:06.110 --> 05:07.410
You know, it was your mom's favorite.

05:09.370 --> 05:10.910
What? Amb, what?

05:10.990 --> 05:14.910
- My editor has given me a story to cover.
- Your own story?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.620
It's about the royal family of Aldovia.

05:17.710 --> 05:20.340
The prince, he's a bit of a playboy.
He might even abdicate.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.210
Peanut, this sounds like
it's gonna be your big break.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.760
Yeah, but the thing is,
I'd have to be away through Christmas.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.300
And I know that you'd be alone. I just...

05:28.390 --> 05:31.680
Sounds like you need a bit
of Fatherly Advice 101.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.140
When me and your mom opened this place,

05:34.220 --> 05:37.900
there were a million reasons why not to,
but your mom said, "Rudy,

05:37.980 --> 05:39.810
you gotta take a chance."

05:39.900 --> 05:42.610
- So you're telling me to open a diner?
- Ha. No.

05:42.690 --> 05:46.200
I'm telling you to stay true
to your dreams, all right?

05:46.280 --> 05:48.570
And success will follow.

05:48.660 --> 05:52.580
- Huh? That's good, right?
- Sounds like a fortune cookie.

05:52.660 --> 05:56.960
All right. Anyway, the point is,
you gotta take a risk if you're gonna win.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.880
So don't worry about your old man.
I'll be fine, all right?

05:59.960 --> 06:02.800
- You go over there to Aldi-whatnot...
- Aldovia.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.920
Aldovia, that's it.

06:05.010 --> 06:06.300
And you make us proud.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.550
All right.

06:11.640 --> 06:12.890
Still $4.95, though.

06:31.370 --> 06:32.830
[man] When's the prince
supposed to arrive?

06:32.910 --> 06:35.080
An hour ago. Maybe he's missed his flight.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.330
Probably shacked up
with some countess somewhere.

06:37.410 --> 06:38.290
[laughs]

06:40.620 --> 06:41.960
[whistles]

06:45.840 --> 06:47.590
Excuse me.

06:47.670 --> 06:50.380
- I'm sorry, I really have to go.
- No, but this is my cab.

06:50.470 --> 06:53.300
- I apologize.
- You can't just do that.

06:53.390 --> 06:54.470
Selfish jerk!

06:55.470 --> 06:57.600
- [sighs]
- [man] That man just took her cab.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.060
Seriously, can you believe that guy?

07:00.140 --> 07:02.230
[man 2] Who does he think he is?

07:16.540 --> 07:18.870
- First time?
- Hm?

07:18.950 --> 07:22.830
- First time covering the royals?
- First time covering anything.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.460
- Any words of wisdom?
- Pick a new career.

07:26.550 --> 07:27.500
Huh.

07:33.550 --> 07:34.930
Wow.

07:58.490 --> 08:00.000
[chatter]

08:00.080 --> 08:02.290
[woman] Will he even show up this time?

08:08.340 --> 08:09.760
[reporter] Oh, come on.
What's taking so long?

08:09.840 --> 08:11.340
[crowd] Yeah!

08:13.130 --> 08:16.390
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much for coming today.

08:16.470 --> 08:18.850
I realize you've traveled
a great distance to be here,

08:18.930 --> 08:20.470
but I'm sorry to announce

08:20.560 --> 08:22.560
we're going to have to cancel
the press conference.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.730
[all react]

08:24.810 --> 08:28.860
Prince Richard is...
unavailable at this time.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.530
[all groan]

08:30.610 --> 08:33.610
- More like he's avoiding the press.
- [all] Yeah!

08:33.700 --> 08:37.120
Does this mean that the prince
is abdicating the throne?

08:37.200 --> 08:41.330
I can assure you,
his coronation is very much on schedule,

08:41.409 --> 08:45.170
and will take place
at the annual Christmas Eve Ball.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.960
- Then where is he?
- [all shout] Yeah!

08:48.040 --> 08:52.510
Uh, the polite young lady
with the red scarf.

08:52.590 --> 08:55.220
When are you rescheduling
the press conference?

08:55.300 --> 08:56.470
- Yeah, she's right!
- Yeah!

08:56.550 --> 09:00.140
We, uh, don't have any plans
for that at this time.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.060
[all groan]

09:02.140 --> 09:04.940
Is it possible to arrange an interview
with Prince Richard?

09:05.020 --> 09:05.890
[all laugh]

09:05.980 --> 09:08.310
There will be no interviews
with the prince.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.230
Thank you so much for coming.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.400
King Richard wouldn't have done this.
Come on!

09:13.490 --> 09:14.700
- Hey!
- [commotion]

09:17.410 --> 09:19.120
Talk about a real jerk-around.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.910
Should've known it would happen
with this guy. What a waste.

09:21.990 --> 09:24.500
- Drinks on me back at the hotel?
- All right.

09:24.580 --> 09:26.160
I can't go home empty-handed.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.180
[car engine starts]

10:09.330 --> 10:10.750
[whispers] Wow.

10:20.430 --> 10:22.390
[camera clicks]

10:36.530 --> 10:37.990
[man] May I help you?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.490
No. No, I... Yes.

10:42.570 --> 10:44.120
I was supposed to be...

10:44.200 --> 10:45.580
Ah.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.330
American.

10:47.410 --> 10:49.040
Excuse me?

10:49.120 --> 10:53.460
You must be the new American tutor
for Princess Emily.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.630
Yes.

10:56.710 --> 10:59.130
That's me, the tutor.

10:59.220 --> 11:01.470
Very good. Follow me, please.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.230
[woman] The garlands go above
the fireplace in the drawing room,

11:10.310 --> 11:13.270
and the queen wants
more poinsettias in the atrium.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.650
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mrs. Averill?

11:15.730 --> 11:18.070
Princess Emily's new tutor has arrived.

11:20.570 --> 11:21.450
Martha Anderson?

11:22.490 --> 11:24.740
That's me. Pleased to meet you.

11:24.830 --> 11:25.740
Oh.

11:25.830 --> 11:27.790
I thought your agency said

11:27.870 --> 11:30.370
you weren't available
till the first of the year?

11:30.460 --> 11:34.630
I wasn't, but then my last assignment
ended early, so...

11:34.710 --> 11:38.710
So you thought
you'd just show up... here.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.260
Two weeks early.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.760
Sorry, I know that it...

11:43.840 --> 11:45.970
I can leave, if it was a bad idea.

11:46.050 --> 11:48.390
The queen did mention
that she wished she had someone

11:48.470 --> 11:51.020
to occupy Princess Emily
over the holidays.

11:51.100 --> 11:55.810
- Her last tutor left rather abruptly.
- What happened?

11:55.900 --> 11:57.610
That's no concern of yours.

11:57.690 --> 11:59.610
Something about a mouse in her bed.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.410
Come with me, please.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.370
- Where's your luggage?
- At the inn.

12:08.450 --> 12:11.500
- I'll have somebody fetch it for you.
- No, no, that's okay. I can get it.

12:11.580 --> 12:15.000
I'm surprised you were able to find a room
with all the press in town.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.880
Parasites, the lot of them.

12:18.340 --> 12:19.880
Scum of the earth.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.430
- Queen Helena will want to meet you.
- The queen?

12:24.510 --> 12:26.300
I trust you're familiar
with our royal etiquette,

12:26.390 --> 12:30.100
so you must not shake Her Majesty's hand,
but you may curtsy.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.020
Curtsy?

12:31.100 --> 12:33.940
- I needed some time to think.
- [queen] You've had time, Richard.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.480
You can't keep missing
these official engagements.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.560
- Yes, Mother.
- Not anymore.

12:41.110 --> 12:42.240
[exhales]

12:43.740 --> 12:44.990
You.

12:45.070 --> 12:47.620
- You know each other?
- Our paths have crossed.

12:49.870 --> 12:53.080
Selfish jerk, at your service.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.370
- I am so sorry. I had...
- No, no, no.

12:55.460 --> 12:57.130
- It's I who should apologize.
- And you are?

12:57.210 --> 13:00.210
Your Majesty,
may I present Miss Martha Anderson,

13:00.300 --> 13:02.010
Princess Emily's new tutor.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.300
[door opens]

13:07.390 --> 13:10.310
- [girl] Richard!
- There you are, my little imp.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.680
- I am not an imp.
- Yes, you are. You're a little imp.

13:13.770 --> 13:14.680
[giggles]

13:14.770 --> 13:16.850
- [Helena] Richard, put her down.
- My little imp.

13:16.940 --> 13:18.560
- Richard.
- [Emily] It feels good.

13:18.650 --> 13:21.780
- Put her down, Richard.
- As you wish, Your Majesty.

13:24.490 --> 13:26.400
I am not a china doll, Mother.

13:26.490 --> 13:30.030
You'll mind me just the same.
If anything were to happen to you...

13:30.120 --> 13:32.790
Mother doesn't let me do anything
but study and go to the loo.

13:32.870 --> 13:35.500
Well, now I do feel sorry for you.

13:35.580 --> 13:37.210
Beard looks awful, by the way.

13:37.290 --> 13:39.880
Yes, you do look like
a derelict Santa Claus.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.250
Yes, I only grew it
so I wouldn't be recognized.

13:42.340 --> 13:44.300
And it appears to be doing the trick.

13:45.590 --> 13:47.760
Who are you
and what are you doing in my palace?

13:47.840 --> 13:49.470
Emily, manners.

13:49.550 --> 13:51.850
She's your new tutor from Minnesota.

13:51.930 --> 13:53.310
I'm Amb...

13:53.390 --> 13:55.850
I am Martha Anderson.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.810
So pleased to meet you, Emily.

13:57.890 --> 14:00.900
You are supposed to call me
"Your Royal Highness."

14:00.980 --> 14:03.280
Don't they teach you anything
at tutor school?

14:03.360 --> 14:05.240
You'll be starting your lessons
right away, Emily.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.860
But it's almost Christmas.

14:06.950 --> 14:10.950
I hope Miss Anderson lasts longer
than your previous tutor.

14:11.030 --> 14:12.450
Place your bets.

14:13.990 --> 14:15.910
I actually like mice.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.830
Mrs. Averill, would you show Miss Anderson
to her new quarters, please?

14:18.920 --> 14:20.080
Of course, Your Majesty.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.210
Thank you. Good day.

14:28.010 --> 14:28.930
[muffled shout]

14:29.010 --> 14:32.180
I am so, so sorry.
Was this expensive or...

14:32.260 --> 14:35.020
Only 15th century Ming porcelain.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.770
I am so sorry.

14:42.730 --> 14:45.360
[giggles quietly]

14:56.160 --> 14:59.080
I'm actually inside the palace.
Undercover.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.120
[Max] I love it.

15:00.210 --> 15:02.290
This is better than an exclusive.

15:02.380 --> 15:05.800
- But I had to lie to get in here.
- Who cares?

15:05.880 --> 15:08.300
Could I go to jail for this?

15:08.380 --> 15:10.680
Two, maybe three weeks tops.

15:10.760 --> 15:13.010
Oh. Not helping.

15:13.090 --> 15:15.640
Listen, just play this out
as long as you can.

15:15.720 --> 15:19.180
Get lots of video, audio,
whatever you can grab.

15:19.270 --> 15:21.900
Can you do this, Amber?

15:21.980 --> 15:22.900
Absolutely.

15:25.480 --> 15:26.860
[bird caws]

15:26.940 --> 15:30.240
I trust you have the curriculum
and lesson plan I sent your agency.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.660
I, uh... No, they must have forgotten.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.070
[scoffs]

15:34.160 --> 15:38.330
My experience with US agencies
could best be described as loosey-goosey.

15:38.410 --> 15:42.330
Not to worry, Mrs. Averill.
There is nothing loose about this goose.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.460
Your Royal Highness.

15:48.090 --> 15:50.920
- You remember Miss Anderson.
- Good morning, Princess Emily.

15:51.930 --> 15:53.390
Go away.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.680
Now that's no way to treat
your new tutor.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.060
- Please, be seated.
- Thank you.

15:58.140 --> 15:59.810
- [gasps]
- [squeaks]

16:05.690 --> 16:08.110
I thought you said you liked mice.

16:08.190 --> 16:09.610
Not as a seat cushion.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.700
Now if you've finished
with the excitement for this morning,

16:14.780 --> 16:17.330
I suggest you start on your lessons.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.950
I started with Modern Art.

16:22.830 --> 16:25.540
What do you think?

16:25.630 --> 16:26.500
Delightful.

16:27.670 --> 16:28.750
I'll leave you to it.

16:34.340 --> 16:36.550
[sighs]

16:44.310 --> 16:47.400
So, how did I do?

16:47.480 --> 16:50.110
Looks good to me.

16:50.190 --> 16:52.490
I got 92 on the state exam.

16:52.570 --> 16:55.240
Well, seeing as you're already
so good at math,

16:55.320 --> 16:57.280
why don't we do some writing?

16:57.370 --> 16:59.280
English is my best subject.

16:59.370 --> 17:02.000
- You're a writer?
- Yes.

17:02.080 --> 17:06.290
No, no, but I studied it
at school in New York.

17:06.369 --> 17:08.589
I thought you're from Minnesota.

17:08.670 --> 17:11.920
I am, but I went to college in New York.

17:13.130 --> 17:14.050
[sighs nervously]

17:14.130 --> 17:16.930
You're wondering
what happened to me, aren't you?

17:17.010 --> 17:18.430
No. No, I just...

17:18.510 --> 17:21.770
It's called spina bifida,
and there is no cure.

17:30.320 --> 17:34.070
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

17:35.070 --> 17:37.070
"Poor little rich girl."

17:37.160 --> 17:39.030
That's what you're thinking.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.580
It's what everyone thinks.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.120
Actually...

17:50.380 --> 17:52.380
"Brave little girl"
is what I was thinking.

17:59.470 --> 18:00.430
[arrow thunking]

18:02.600 --> 18:05.390
How does some fresh air sound,
Your Royal Highness?

18:12.650 --> 18:14.070
[Emily] What are you doing, Richard?

18:14.150 --> 18:17.150
I'm, uh... adjusting the sights
on my new bow.

18:20.990 --> 18:22.530
Are you all right?

18:22.620 --> 18:27.290
Yes, I'm fine, Your Royal Highness.
It's just your face.

18:27.370 --> 18:32.340
- Something wrong with my face?
- No. No, it's perfectly normal.

18:32.420 --> 18:34.420
- Perfectly normal?
- No, I didn't mean that.

18:34.500 --> 18:38.550
What I meant was that I almost
didn't recognize you because you shaved,

18:38.630 --> 18:41.550
and probably because your mother
didn't like your beard.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.600
Not that you have to do everything
your mother says. It's just...

18:44.680 --> 18:46.720
So, archery?

18:46.810 --> 18:49.980
Yes, my... my father taught me
when I was younger.

18:51.310 --> 18:53.190
It was a little while ago.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.360
We can tell.

18:57.150 --> 18:59.400
Shouldn't you be off
reducing a fraction or something?

18:59.490 --> 19:01.450
We're on a break. Let me try.

19:01.530 --> 19:04.200
Oh, this bow will be
far too heavy for you.

19:04.280 --> 19:07.290
Oh, I think Princess Emily can manage.

19:07.370 --> 19:09.040
Unless you're afraid of being shown up.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.750
[scoffs]

19:10.830 --> 19:12.330
Fine. Here you are.

19:15.130 --> 19:16.250
Here's your arrow.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.630
Thank you.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.050
If Mother could see this,
she would lop off my head.

19:23.140 --> 19:24.680
Better than lopping off something else.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.180
Princess Emily.

19:26.260 --> 19:28.060
Like his ear.

19:34.020 --> 19:35.020
Yes!

19:35.110 --> 19:37.070
Amazing. High five!

19:40.990 --> 19:43.660
- Pure beginner's luck that was.
- Oh, I'm sure.

19:43.740 --> 19:45.330
Miss Martha's next.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.410
- No, I can't.
- Just try.

19:47.490 --> 19:51.080
Well, there aren't any Ming vases around,
so you might as well give it a go.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.040
- There you are.
- How do I do it?

19:54.130 --> 19:57.800
Well, you nock it just there.

19:57.880 --> 20:01.510
Feet aligned, grip hand about nose height,

20:01.590 --> 20:03.340
and draw it back.

20:04.390 --> 20:05.220
Good.

20:08.010 --> 20:08.970
[gasps]

20:10.100 --> 20:11.430
[gasps]

20:13.560 --> 20:15.400
- Bull's-eye.
- [gasps]

20:15.480 --> 20:16.560
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

20:19.530 --> 20:21.360
[Richard] Come on!
We gotta get out of here!

20:21.440 --> 20:23.150
[Amber] I can't believe I just did that.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.870
How do you even read this stuff?
It's like gibberish.

20:28.950 --> 20:32.290
Scatter plots? Well, what is that?
I mean, what do I do?

20:32.370 --> 20:34.710
You could hire a tutor.

20:34.790 --> 20:38.340
Just stay calm
and be at one with the numbers.

20:38.420 --> 20:39.750
[knock]

20:39.840 --> 20:41.510
I gotta go. Come in.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.010
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.510
What are you doing?

20:49.600 --> 20:53.770
Well, I was preparing
your lesson plan for tomorrow.

20:53.850 --> 20:58.730
There's lots of numbers
and equation-y thingies.

20:58.820 --> 21:02.190
Well, we're sorry to have barged in,
but Princess Emily insisted.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.530
- I'd like you to be my guest.
- Your guest for what?

21:05.610 --> 21:11.200
The Royal family will be serving cocktails
to esteemed members of the nobility.

21:11.290 --> 21:13.410
And you, apparently.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.000
I would be delighted.

21:17.750 --> 21:20.550
[classical music playing]

21:37.980 --> 21:38.860
Jellied meat, Madame?

21:38.940 --> 21:40.150
Huh!

21:42.780 --> 21:44.820
I'm good.

21:44.900 --> 21:47.740
[guests chattering]

21:52.450 --> 21:58.210
[man] If I may ask, Your Majesty,
what exactly is the prince thinking?

21:58.290 --> 22:00.340
Thinking about what?

22:00.420 --> 22:04.210
It's no secret he has his doubts
about assuming the throne.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.050
And if he doesn't, I'm afraid...

22:06.130 --> 22:09.140
Prime Minister,
let me put your fears to rest.

22:09.220 --> 22:11.180
Richard will accept his father's crown.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.680
Your Majesty.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.810
- You look absolutely radiant.
- Thank you, Simon.

22:19.900 --> 22:20.810
Prime Minister.

22:22.110 --> 22:26.530
Tell me, where is my beloved cousin?
Still gallivanting across the Continent?

22:26.610 --> 22:28.070
[man] Greetings, Your Highness.

22:28.150 --> 22:29.740
[woman] Good evening, Prince Richard.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.240
- Here he is.
- Sorry I'm late.

22:33.330 --> 22:36.910
I couldn't find my cufflinks.
Your Majesty, Prime Minister.

22:37.000 --> 22:37.830
Your Royal Highness.

22:38.870 --> 22:42.090
Hello, cousin.
I heard I just missed you in Majorca.

22:42.170 --> 22:44.210
I was staying with the president,
in his chalet.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.380
Well, I was on the beach, in a tent.

22:47.470 --> 22:48.720
Still soul searching?

22:49.720 --> 22:50.760
At least I've got one.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.720
Ah.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.640
Excuse me.

22:55.310 --> 22:57.350
Mrs. Averill. Good to see you both.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.440
- Are you enjoying the party?
- I am.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.440
Uh...

23:05.530 --> 23:06.690
Thank you for inviting me.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.570
You seem rather fascinated
with my brother.

23:10.660 --> 23:15.870
I was just looking for something to eat,
and I'm not a big fan of meat jelly.

23:15.950 --> 23:18.080
Me neither. Follow me.

23:24.790 --> 23:27.170
- Better?
- So better.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.550
I've been meaning to ask you,

23:31.630 --> 23:33.640
why are you so nice to me all of a sudden?

23:33.720 --> 23:35.810
Because you're different
from everyone else here.

23:35.890 --> 23:37.100
[chuckles]

23:37.180 --> 23:40.350
Because I don't know how to curtsy
and I break everything?

23:40.430 --> 23:42.020
Because you treat me like a normal child.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.560
You are a normal child.

23:44.650 --> 23:47.190
- With a castle and a crown.
- Nobody's perfect.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.450
Princess Emily.

23:51.530 --> 23:54.240
Cousin Simon.
I didn't know you were coming.

23:54.320 --> 23:56.830
I wouldn't miss your brother's coronation
for the world.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.710
Did the queen invite
one of the chambermaids?

24:00.790 --> 24:06.040
This is my tutor, Miss Martha Anderson,
and I invited her.

24:06.130 --> 24:09.300
Miss Martha, meet Simon, my cousin.

24:09.380 --> 24:11.380
Nice to meet you, Simon.

24:11.470 --> 24:14.300
You shall address me as Lord Duxbury.

24:14.390 --> 24:16.430
I find that nobility
who insist on using their titles

24:16.510 --> 24:18.810
are the same as those who drive Ferraris.

24:18.890 --> 24:21.770
- And what's wrong with my Ferrari?
- Nothing wrong with it.

24:21.850 --> 24:23.900
It's just what it's compensating for
is the issue.

24:25.690 --> 24:31.650
Lord Duxbury, how lovely to see you both
at the same function.

24:31.740 --> 24:33.030
Simon hates him

24:33.110 --> 24:35.910
because Richard is one ahead of him
in the line of succession.

24:35.990 --> 24:38.910
So, if Richard abdicates,

24:38.990 --> 24:42.120
Simon is next in line for the throne,
not you?

24:42.210 --> 24:45.830
Male bloodline. It's totally unfair.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.040
No kidding.

24:49.250 --> 24:54.340
A conniving cousin jockeys for the throne.
That's pretty juicy stuff.

24:54.430 --> 24:58.510
True, but what I really need
is some one-on-one time with the prince.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.560
So, what's he like?

25:00.640 --> 25:05.730
He's not what I was expecting.
I mean, he's kind of cocky, but...

25:05.810 --> 25:09.400
There's something else. A vulnerability.
I don't know how to describe it.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.360
- You are so smitten.
- Look at you.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.570
- You're blushing.
- No, I'm not.

25:14.650 --> 25:17.450
Seriously, Max wants me
to dig up some dirt.

25:17.530 --> 25:20.200
But I'm just...
I'm not sure there's any here.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.290
Dude, they're royals.

25:22.370 --> 25:25.870
Where there's a tiara, there's dirt.
Trust me.

25:29.670 --> 25:32.260
[birds chirping]

25:34.510 --> 25:37.800
[piano playing "The First Noel"]

25:48.600 --> 25:51.020
[piano grows louder]

26:05.450 --> 26:06.960
[creaking]

26:08.500 --> 26:10.460
I am so sorry, Your Royal Highness.

26:10.540 --> 26:13.050
Please, just call me Richard.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.170
You're really talented.

26:15.260 --> 26:17.630
My father made me take lessons.

26:17.720 --> 26:21.300
He said music was the food of the soul.

26:21.390 --> 26:24.020
I heard King Richard was a great man.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.640
He was.

26:25.730 --> 26:27.640
It won't be easy to replace him.

26:27.730 --> 26:29.730
I'm not trying to replace him.

26:29.810 --> 26:31.560
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...

26:31.650 --> 26:34.730
I just meant there must be
a lot of pressure on you.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.860
You're under more pressure
than you bargained for, aren't you?

26:38.280 --> 26:40.820
My sister can be a lot to handle.

26:40.910 --> 26:42.410
Yes, right.

26:42.490 --> 26:44.120
I actually think she's great.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.790
After my father passed away,
she took it very hard.

26:49.000 --> 26:49.830
I lost my mom.

26:51.330 --> 26:52.420
Leukemia.

26:54.210 --> 26:55.090
Then you know.

26:56.130 --> 26:57.470
Holidays are the worst.

26:59.090 --> 27:01.510
I'm pleased she's got somebody to talk to.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.850
So now you're back, are you here to stay?

27:07.100 --> 27:09.230
Is all that talk about abdication
just gossip?

27:10.600 --> 27:12.810
It's very hard to know what to do.

27:12.900 --> 27:17.820
I heard people say
you didn't want to give up your lifestyle.

27:17.900 --> 27:20.650
- What lifestyle is that?
- I don't know.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.450
Women, wine, and song?

27:22.530 --> 27:24.580
Is that what you think I am?

27:25.580 --> 27:27.160
I don't really know who you are.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.620
My mother's expecting me.

27:38.880 --> 27:42.010
[indistinct chatter]

27:47.560 --> 27:51.060
When I look at all of you,
I'm reminded how important you are to me,

27:52.060 --> 27:53.400
and were to King Richard.

27:54.690 --> 27:58.900
To family and old friends.

27:58.980 --> 28:00.860
[all] To family and friends.

28:02.700 --> 28:04.280
And to new friends too.

28:06.830 --> 28:11.830
King Richard gave us an entire box
of his handmade ornaments last year.

28:11.910 --> 28:16.500
He said they were elephants,
but they look a lot more like bears.

28:16.590 --> 28:18.500
It was important to the king.

28:18.590 --> 28:21.220
- To give handmade gifts.
- They're the best kind.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.550
Whether they look like bears or elephants.

28:26.640 --> 28:27.560
I found this one.

28:29.060 --> 28:32.440
Stashed away after... after he...

28:32.520 --> 28:35.440
- Here. Let me, ma'am.
- Where was it, Mother?

28:35.520 --> 28:38.360
Your father had put it
in a secret hiding place,

28:38.440 --> 28:40.320
but he wasn't very good
at keeping secrets.

28:41.530 --> 28:44.570
I suppose he was going to give it to me
last Christmas.

28:44.660 --> 28:46.320
I love it.

28:46.410 --> 28:47.370
It's beautiful.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.450
Tell us about
your Christmas traditions, Martha.

28:52.580 --> 28:56.710
Well, my father and I always
light a candle for my mother,

28:57.750 --> 29:00.670
and we bake her favorite cookies,

29:00.760 --> 29:02.880
watch her favorite Christmas movie.

29:04.130 --> 29:05.930
I know how it feels
to miss someone you love.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.300
[Helena] Indeed.

29:09.970 --> 29:11.890
- Can you help me with this?
- Sure.

29:11.970 --> 29:13.180
Merry Christmas to all!

29:14.810 --> 29:16.190
Lady Sophia!

29:17.230 --> 29:19.360
You're a sight for sore eyes.

29:19.440 --> 29:22.280
Things around here
were getting positively gloomy.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.860
Happy to help. I see you've started
celebrating early, Simon.

29:25.950 --> 29:26.910
[scoffs]

29:28.320 --> 29:30.580
- Your Majesty.
- Welcome, my dear.

29:31.990 --> 29:33.080
Hello, Richard.

29:33.160 --> 29:36.120
- Merry Christmas.
- What a surprise to see you.

29:38.380 --> 29:40.460
Lady Sophia has come
to spend the holiday with us.

29:40.540 --> 29:41.380
Wonderful.

29:41.460 --> 29:45.420
- We've so much to catch up on.
- Excuse me for a minute.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.510
I wish you'd told me
you were inviting her, Mother.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.510
I thought it might be a nice surprise.

29:51.600 --> 29:53.930
I can't believe your father made that
from scratch.

29:54.020 --> 29:55.850
He was really good.

29:55.940 --> 29:57.600
Something for later.

29:57.690 --> 30:00.310
- I was...
- So, who might that be?

30:01.650 --> 30:04.150
Oh, that's the princess' tutor.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.070
Fascinating choice of shoes.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.570
[Emily] This one is my favorite.

30:10.660 --> 30:15.120
Your Majesty, I brought this
as my humble contribution.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.460
A heart. How lovely.

30:17.540 --> 30:20.880
Richard, would you put it on the tree?

30:26.670 --> 30:27.510
Be gentle with it.

30:39.690 --> 30:40.860
[typing]

30:40.940 --> 30:43.980
[Amber] Why did the queen
bring Lady Sophia here now?

30:44.070 --> 30:46.690
To help persuade the prince
to take the crown?

30:46.780 --> 30:49.780
Sophia obviously thinks
it's something more.

30:49.860 --> 30:50.990
What about Richard?

30:52.120 --> 30:54.240
I still can't get a read.

31:04.340 --> 31:05.170
Morning.

31:07.260 --> 31:10.260
- Good morning.
- What are you up to?

31:10.340 --> 31:12.300
Just catching up on some emails.

31:12.390 --> 31:15.100
- Are you ready for your lesson?
- No.

31:15.180 --> 31:16.970
We're going to bake
Christmas cookies instead.

31:17.060 --> 31:20.560
You're gonna get me in big trouble
if we don't start your lesson by 9:00.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.400
Not nearly as much trouble
as if I told them your real name.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.650
Miss Amber Moore.

31:27.860 --> 31:30.240
- Don't even bother denying it.
- But, how...

31:30.320 --> 31:32.530
You don't know the first thing
about tutoring, for one.

31:33.570 --> 31:35.950
Also, I looked at your computer yesterday
while you were in the loo.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.000
It's locked.

31:39.080 --> 31:42.290
Yes, but you put your password in
in plain sight. Big mistake.

31:43.580 --> 31:44.590
[sighs]

31:44.670 --> 31:47.710
- I'll pack my things.
- Wait.

31:51.630 --> 31:53.550
No one has to know.

31:53.640 --> 31:58.560
- You're not gonna tell anyone?
- Not as long as we have a deal.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.060
What kind of a deal?

32:01.140 --> 32:05.360
You write the truth about my brother,
and I'll keep your secret.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.690
You mean the things that are written
about him, they're...

32:08.980 --> 32:11.900
- They're not true?
- Not even close.

32:11.990 --> 32:16.200
- So he's not a playboy or a philanderer?
- You've seen him.

32:17.280 --> 32:20.330
His idea of fun is playing William Tell
with a bow and arrow.

32:20.410 --> 32:22.670
[Emily chuckles]

32:22.750 --> 32:24.880
So, do we have a deal?

32:26.290 --> 32:27.800
- Deal.
- Good.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.970
Now, about those Christmas cookies...

32:33.930 --> 32:37.260
I hope you have a big appetite.
We are making a lot of cookies.

32:39.140 --> 32:42.640
So, what's going on
with your brother and Baroness Sophia?

32:42.730 --> 32:44.020
Is this for your story?

32:45.270 --> 32:47.820
I need to know the truth
if I'm gonna write the truth.

32:49.150 --> 32:53.200
He used to love her,
but that was a long time ago.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.570
Now she's back, so who knows?

32:57.030 --> 32:58.410
[Amber] Simon's into her.

32:58.490 --> 33:01.750
[Emily] Simon's wanted everything
Richard had since they were boys.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.250
Seems like everyone wants what we have.

33:05.330 --> 33:07.040
You are the royal family.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.630
Things used to be different
before my father died.

33:12.970 --> 33:15.510
And now that he's gone...

33:15.590 --> 33:16.430
Hey.

33:18.510 --> 33:19.470
He's not gone.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.310
You'll always have him in here.

33:27.770 --> 33:29.610
Now, come on,
we've gotta get these in the oven.

33:33.610 --> 33:36.450
[playing "Silent Night"]

33:44.250 --> 33:45.250
May I come in?

33:47.080 --> 33:47.920
Please.

33:51.090 --> 33:53.590
I hope you don't mind
that I'm staying for a few days.

33:53.670 --> 33:55.260
Of course not.

33:55.340 --> 33:58.510
- I do wonder why you're here.
- Because your mother asked me.

33:59.510 --> 34:00.640
And the truth is,

34:03.220 --> 34:06.640
I've never gotten over you, Richard.

34:06.730 --> 34:08.770
- And I'm not sure you're over me.
- Please.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.980
We both know this isn't going to work.

34:12.070 --> 34:14.320
At least let me help you
with the benefit tomorrow.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.530
You need to make a good impression.

34:16.610 --> 34:19.280
And you and I make such a fantastic team.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.120
That benefit is to raise money
for orphaned children.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.580
It's not a PR opportunity.

34:24.659 --> 34:26.080
You're being naive.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.710
Tell me, Sophia,
would you even bother with me

34:27.790 --> 34:29.960
if I wasn't next in line to the throne?

34:30.040 --> 34:32.000
It's part of who you are.

34:32.090 --> 34:35.380
- The part that matters most to you.
- Now you're being unfair.

34:35.460 --> 34:37.340
Am I?

34:37.420 --> 34:40.300
I was young and stupid,

34:41.510 --> 34:42.600
and I made a mistake.

34:44.389 --> 34:47.179
I do love you, Richard.

34:47.270 --> 34:48.690
Never doubt it.

34:51.110 --> 34:53.400
- [music plays]
- [crowd applauds]

34:55.320 --> 34:57.070
[bell clanks]

34:58.320 --> 35:00.610
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.280
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

35:02.370 --> 35:05.540
- [girl] Thank you, Santa.
- [chuckles] Here you go.

35:07.830 --> 35:08.830
- Hey!
- Sorry.

35:10.870 --> 35:11.880
I know you.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.290
You must have me confused
with someone else.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.210
Don't give me that.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.880
How'd you get all cozy with the princess?

35:18.970 --> 35:21.180
She doesn't have to speak to you.

35:21.260 --> 35:24.300
How about an interview, Princess?
With a real reporter.

35:24.390 --> 35:28.850
Well, since you're a real reporter,
let me tell you a secret.

35:28.930 --> 35:30.980
[whispers]

35:36.650 --> 35:38.740
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing much.

35:38.820 --> 35:40.650
Just that if he didn't leave
Aldovia at once,

35:40.740 --> 35:44.200
I'd get him arrested and send him
to the dungeon for insulting my guest.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.370
Seriously, you guys have a dungeon?

35:46.450 --> 35:49.620
No, but he doesn't need to know that.

35:49.710 --> 35:52.330
[chorus sings "Deck The Halls"]

36:04.720 --> 36:08.220
Thank you, children.
That was really lovely.

36:08.310 --> 36:11.190
And thanks to all of you

36:11.270 --> 36:15.190
for supporting our holiday festival
to benefit the children

36:15.270 --> 36:16.900
of Saint Joseph's Orphanage.

36:17.900 --> 36:20.440
From the day that my husband,
King Richard,

36:20.530 --> 36:24.910
became patron of the orphanage,
he always made the closing remarks.

36:24.990 --> 36:28.740
And today, to continue this tradition,

36:28.830 --> 36:33.370
is my beloved son,
and your prince, Richard.

36:33.460 --> 36:36.420
[applause, cheers]

36:36.500 --> 36:37.880
Prince Richard.

36:40.710 --> 36:42.260
Prince Richard?

36:42.340 --> 36:44.010
Oh, no.

36:44.090 --> 36:45.050
Prince Richard?

36:49.260 --> 36:52.100
- Will the coronation be postponed?
- Oh, no, of course not.

36:52.180 --> 36:54.650
- If so, who will rule the country?
- Everyone, please.

36:54.730 --> 36:56.190
He was here a moment ago.

36:56.270 --> 36:58.070
I think I know where he is. This way.

36:58.150 --> 37:00.280
Richard will be here momentarily.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.530
[Richard] Right.
Let's put some more snow on him

37:06.620 --> 37:09.620
and should we get some clothes on, yes?
We need a hat and a scarf for him.

37:10.870 --> 37:12.960
- [Richard] He's amazing.
- [Emily] I should've known.

37:13.040 --> 37:16.380
Every time we do a benefit,
my brother ends up here.

37:17.420 --> 37:19.340
He really cares about these kids.

37:19.420 --> 37:21.960
- So, soldiers, in your positions.
- [kids shriek]

37:24.010 --> 37:27.220
And now, on a charge of high treason,

37:27.300 --> 37:33.020
I hereby condemn this snowman
to death by firing squad.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.810
- Are you ready?
- [all] Yes!

37:35.890 --> 37:39.060
Three, two, one...

37:39.150 --> 37:40.570
- Fire! No!
- [kid] Get him!

37:41.980 --> 37:42.990
You traitors!

37:43.070 --> 37:45.240
- [kid] Don't let him go!
- [Richard] Right, game on.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.700
[Amber laughs]

37:47.780 --> 37:48.740
[kid] I'm gonna get you!

37:48.820 --> 37:50.950
[Richard] If you wanna get me,
I'm gonna get you back.

37:51.030 --> 37:52.290
Oh, no!

37:52.370 --> 37:54.040
- Get him!
- Get him!

37:54.120 --> 37:56.040
- Good shot!
- Get him!

38:01.170 --> 38:02.000
[Richard] Good shot.

38:05.220 --> 38:09.010
Richard, help me understand
why you shirked your duty today.

38:09.090 --> 38:11.220
I thought my duty was to those children.

38:13.020 --> 38:17.810
There is more to being king
than just compassion.

38:17.890 --> 38:20.860
You need to be strong.
You need to be a leader.

38:20.940 --> 38:21.900
I just don't...

38:23.230 --> 38:26.400
Well, you think you're the only one
who wants to run away?

38:26.490 --> 38:28.570
Come on, Mother.

38:28.660 --> 38:31.370
Not you. You're one
of the strongest women I know.

38:31.450 --> 38:34.290
This has been the hardest year of my life.

38:34.370 --> 38:37.580
Losing your father,
trying to be strong for Emily,

38:37.660 --> 38:41.250
not knowing where you were
when I needed you more than ever.

38:42.460 --> 38:43.460
I'm trying, Mother.

38:45.420 --> 38:46.590
I really am.

38:52.720 --> 38:55.060
I have complete faith in you.

38:57.270 --> 38:59.600
But you need to have faith in yourself.

39:04.150 --> 39:05.440
[Amber] Okay, very good.

39:05.530 --> 39:06.940
But here is a harder one.

39:07.030 --> 39:09.820
Can you give me an example of hyperbole?

39:09.910 --> 39:13.160
Is it hyperbole
if I said this is so boring,

39:13.240 --> 39:14.450
my head might explode?

39:16.870 --> 39:21.170
How do you expect me to focus
when it's three days till Christmas?

39:21.250 --> 39:22.960
Okay, you win.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.670
What do you say
we have a little adventure?

39:27.760 --> 39:28.760
Adventure?

39:32.760 --> 39:35.100
[Amber] Shh, make sure the coast is clear.

39:35.180 --> 39:36.220
[Emily] Okay, go.

39:40.270 --> 39:41.270
Hurry, hurry. Come on.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.820
[elevator dings]

39:51.780 --> 39:55.330
Now with the ball in two days,
I need you and all the staff to step up.

39:55.410 --> 39:57.200
- Right.
- We have three things here and...

40:00.790 --> 40:03.250
Three things here I need you to get.

40:10.260 --> 40:11.300
[Amber] Here we are.

40:13.090 --> 40:14.180
You ready for some fun?

40:22.980 --> 40:23.810
What's wrong?

40:25.110 --> 40:26.730
Do you really think I can do it?

40:27.770 --> 40:30.650
I think you can do anything you want to.

40:30.740 --> 40:32.400
You're not a china doll.

40:32.490 --> 40:33.950
I don't know.

40:34.030 --> 40:37.330
What if I end up even more broken
than I already am?

40:37.410 --> 40:39.160
You're not broken, Em.

40:41.580 --> 40:43.170
Dibs on the front.

40:43.250 --> 40:44.080
Okay.

40:46.250 --> 40:47.090
You ready?

40:48.340 --> 40:50.170
You ready? Hang on!
[shrieks]

40:50.260 --> 40:52.260
[both shouting]

40:52.340 --> 40:54.090
[Amber] Be careful. Oh!

40:54.180 --> 40:55.970
- [Amber laughs]
- [Emily] Speed up! Come on!

40:57.180 --> 40:59.010
[Amber] Yeah! Whoo!

40:59.100 --> 41:00.560
[Emily laughs]

41:01.680 --> 41:04.230
- [Amber] Oh, my goodness!
- [Emily] Faster, faster!

41:06.520 --> 41:08.270
- [Amber] No!
- [Emily] Watch out!

41:08.360 --> 41:09.570
- Turn!
- How?

41:13.610 --> 41:15.320
[Emily shrieks]

41:15.410 --> 41:17.700
[panting]

41:17.780 --> 41:19.870
- Em? Emily?
- Amber.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.160
- Emily, are you okay?
- [Emily grunts]

41:25.370 --> 41:26.960
Again!

41:27.040 --> 41:29.540
You little... Ooh, I am gonna get you.

41:29.630 --> 41:31.550
[gasps]

41:31.630 --> 41:34.260
- Richard!
- You are so done.

41:34.340 --> 41:36.380
[Emily] Girls against boys!

41:36.470 --> 41:37.300
[Richard] Incoming!

41:39.010 --> 41:40.510
Let me see what you got.

41:43.730 --> 41:44.730
[Amber laughs]

41:44.810 --> 41:45.940
[Richard] You missed me.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.030
Here we go.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.860
[laughs]

42:00.950 --> 42:03.080
Hey, no fraternizing with the enemy!

42:04.500 --> 42:05.330
Got you!

42:06.750 --> 42:08.330
[Amber laughs]

42:11.630 --> 42:14.420
Glorious out here, isn't it?

42:14.510 --> 42:16.340
If by "glorious" you mean
you enjoy frostbite,

42:16.420 --> 42:18.640
then it's perfectly sublime.

42:18.720 --> 42:20.600
- [Emily in distance] Hey!
- Stop.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.430
[Emily] It's not fair.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.810
[Simon] Those two look
quite cozy together.

42:27.890 --> 42:31.570
There's something
about Miss Martha that isn't right.

42:31.650 --> 42:35.490
You mean besides the fact
that the prince is smitten with her?

42:35.570 --> 42:38.320
[Amber and Richard laughing]

42:40.160 --> 42:41.700
[Richard] Oh, come on,
you gotta try harder.

42:43.200 --> 42:46.040
[all laughing]

42:48.870 --> 42:51.330
- [Emily] Can we do it again tomorrow?
- [Amber] We'll see.

42:51.420 --> 42:53.340
[Richard] No more two against one.

42:53.420 --> 42:55.260
[Helena] Aren't you all a sight?

42:58.220 --> 42:59.760
Your Majesty.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.050
Miss Anderson.

43:03.760 --> 43:07.930
One of the groundskeepers told me
he saw you and Emily

43:08.020 --> 43:08.980
on a toboggan.

43:09.980 --> 43:12.110
- Is this true?
- They were just having a bit of fun.

43:12.190 --> 43:14.360
I wasn't speaking to you.

43:15.610 --> 43:17.610
- Queen Helena, I'm so sorry...
- Enough.

43:19.400 --> 43:22.820
I know my children feel
that I've been overprotective.

43:22.910 --> 43:25.540
Their impertinence is inexcusable.

43:26.950 --> 43:31.920
That said, my late husband was a great
believer in fresh air and exercise.

43:33.670 --> 43:37.840
And I haven't seen a real smile
on my daughter's face in over a year.

43:39.170 --> 43:42.340
So if you wish to continue in our employ,
Miss Anderson,

43:42.430 --> 43:46.060
I suggest you ask permission in future.

43:46.140 --> 43:47.810
Of course, Your Majesty.

43:51.480 --> 43:53.360
[Helena] And next time,

43:55.770 --> 43:57.530
perhaps you might give serious thought

43:57.610 --> 44:00.820
to inviting your queen
on your tobogganing expeditions.

44:02.780 --> 44:04.820
I happen to know my way around a bobsled.

44:04.910 --> 44:05.990
[all chuckle]

44:06.080 --> 44:08.120
- Yes, Mother.
- [Amber] Yes, Your Majesty.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.290
[typing]

44:14.380 --> 44:17.090
[Amber] I think I'm finally
getting to know the real prince.

44:17.170 --> 44:19.420
So not what I thought.

44:19.510 --> 44:23.220
The coronation's almost here,
but I still don't know the real story.

44:23.300 --> 44:25.100
I have to dig deeper.

44:25.180 --> 44:27.810
I have to figure out
what's going on in his head.

44:32.230 --> 44:33.730
[chirping]

44:36.060 --> 44:38.190
[horse neighs]

44:50.790 --> 44:51.830
[clicks tongue]

44:57.590 --> 44:59.710
[horse whinnies]

46:01.320 --> 46:02.900
We've lost the prince's tracks.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.490
I hope you know where you're going.

46:16.330 --> 46:17.540
I think we're lost.

46:18.960 --> 46:21.340
Maybe we should head back now.

46:21.420 --> 46:24.260
Let's head back.
No, no, no. No, no, no.

46:24.340 --> 46:26.760
What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey!

46:26.840 --> 46:27.930
- [whinnies]
- No, no!

46:29.510 --> 46:30.970
[grunts]

46:32.220 --> 46:33.060
Wait!

46:34.720 --> 46:36.680
Come on! Come back!

46:57.410 --> 46:58.250
Hello?

47:05.210 --> 47:08.470
[growling]

47:09.930 --> 47:11.140
Oh!

47:11.220 --> 47:12.720
[growls]

47:12.800 --> 47:13.640
Help!

47:21.100 --> 47:22.360
Help!

47:22.440 --> 47:24.020
[gunshots]

47:24.110 --> 47:26.230
- [whines]
- [Richard] Go on! Get away!

47:26.320 --> 47:27.240
Get out of here!

47:28.490 --> 47:30.200
[Amber whimpers]

47:31.950 --> 47:33.410
You all right? You hurt?

47:35.410 --> 47:36.240
I'm good.

47:38.750 --> 47:39.580
Thank you.

47:49.170 --> 47:51.680
An old Aldovian cure-all.

47:54.100 --> 47:54.930
What's in it?

47:55.930 --> 47:57.060
Whiskey, mostly.

47:58.470 --> 48:03.350
So, now that we've warded off
wolves, hypothermia,

48:03.440 --> 48:04.730
and assured your survival,

48:05.980 --> 48:07.780
why were you following me?

48:07.860 --> 48:08.820
I was curious.

48:10.400 --> 48:13.820
And I'd never ridden a horse
outside of Central Park before.

48:13.910 --> 48:15.280
And?

48:15.370 --> 48:16.740
I think I'll stick to my Volvo.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Where are we?

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
This is my father's old hunting cabin.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.380
He taught me how to ride,
how to fish, how to shoot.

48:28.550 --> 48:32.430
- Lots of memories?
- Not all of them good.

48:32.510 --> 48:34.800
The last time the two of us were here,
things didn't go so well.

48:36.140 --> 48:37.180
What happened?

48:37.260 --> 48:39.100
I told him I was going
to renounce the throne.

48:40.520 --> 48:41.600
That I didn't want to be king.

48:43.020 --> 48:43.940
And what did he say?

48:44.940 --> 48:45.770
He was angry,

48:46.980 --> 48:47.820
and I was...

48:50.280 --> 48:51.400
terrible.

48:53.240 --> 48:54.530
I flew to Spain the next day.

48:55.820 --> 48:57.280
That was the last time I saw him.

48:59.370 --> 49:01.540
So why don't you want to be king?

49:01.620 --> 49:02.830
Do we have to talk about this?

49:03.920 --> 49:05.250
It might be good for you.

49:06.540 --> 49:07.790
I can't even go for a beer with a girl

49:07.880 --> 49:11.010
without it being treated
like an international scandal.

49:11.090 --> 49:14.050
Like when you went out with Sophia?

49:14.130 --> 49:15.590
That was different.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.220
She sold a story to a tabloid.

49:19.430 --> 49:21.350
The press had a field day.

49:21.430 --> 49:25.400
So that's what's holding you back,
being in the public eye.

49:25.480 --> 49:28.900
- It's more complicated than that.
- Tell me.

49:28.980 --> 49:29.820
Why bother?

49:30.900 --> 49:33.280
You just think
I'm a spoiled rich kid anyway.

49:33.360 --> 49:34.570
I never said that.

49:36.280 --> 49:39.620
I think you need to stop worrying
about what everybody thinks about you

49:39.700 --> 49:43.580
and who your father was,
and figure out who you want to be.

49:44.960 --> 49:46.080
You make it sound so simple.

49:47.080 --> 49:48.750
Why can't it be?

49:48.840 --> 49:53.050
You're smart, nice, personable.

49:53.130 --> 49:55.220
Except when I'm stealing your cab.

49:55.300 --> 49:56.970
It was actually quite funny.

49:57.050 --> 49:58.720
[chuckles]

50:01.260 --> 50:02.720
I want to show you something.

50:08.400 --> 50:10.360
I found it in my father's journal
the other day.

50:11.730 --> 50:13.990
- What is it?
- It's a poem.

50:14.070 --> 50:17.700
It was dated just before he died.

50:17.780 --> 50:19.950
He dedicated it to my mother.

50:20.030 --> 50:23.370
I assumed he was gonna give it to her
with the ornament he made, the acorn.

50:23.450 --> 50:25.960
- Has she seen it?
- Not yet.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.540
I was gonna give it to her this Christmas.

50:30.330 --> 50:34.260
"Frost a'sparkle in the fields
'twixt the frozen minarets.

50:34.340 --> 50:39.010
Winter's harvest, meager yields,
heavy burdens, the year's debts.

50:39.090 --> 50:43.430
But from a seed, an acorn's gift,
henceforth the truth will flood.

50:43.510 --> 50:46.140
Darkness such a secret bears,

50:46.230 --> 50:49.150
and a love far greater than blood."

50:49.230 --> 50:50.730
It's some sort of riddle.

50:52.570 --> 50:55.360
- It's mysterious.
- Yes.

50:56.360 --> 50:57.200
It's beautiful.

50:59.450 --> 51:00.280
Yes.

51:01.700 --> 51:03.490
[horse whinnies outside]

51:04.910 --> 51:07.120
I'd better go check on them.

51:37.490 --> 51:39.240
[horse whinnies]

52:04.430 --> 52:05.300
[Richard] Here we are.

52:06.390 --> 52:09.770
- Back safe and sound.
- [Amber] Thank you, again.

52:34.330 --> 52:35.840
Stephen Ward?

52:41.010 --> 52:42.470
Oh, my gosh.

52:45.430 --> 52:47.390
[Amber] You are not gonna believe this.

52:47.470 --> 52:48.930
The prince was adopted.

52:49.020 --> 52:51.480
- No way.
- Yes way.

52:51.560 --> 52:56.020
I've got his birth certificate,
a fake certificate the royals created,

52:56.110 --> 52:59.400
and the freaking adoption papers.

52:59.480 --> 53:00.480
This is huge.

53:00.570 --> 53:03.200
- You think he knows?
- No.

53:03.280 --> 53:04.360
Being adopted would mean

53:04.450 --> 53:06.280
he'd have to forfeit
his right to the crown.

53:06.370 --> 53:09.910
If he knew about it, he would've used it
as an out a long time ago.

53:09.990 --> 53:11.830
- Have you told Max?
- No.

53:11.910 --> 53:14.830
- And you can't mention it either.
- What are you gonna do?

53:16.040 --> 53:17.290
I don't know yet.

53:17.380 --> 53:20.760
You've got a legit Aldovian
birther scandal on your hands,

53:20.840 --> 53:22.380
and you don't know yet?

53:22.470 --> 53:23.800
Break the story.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.890
This is somebody's life
we're talking about.

53:25.970 --> 53:27.350
Yeah, but you said it yourself.

53:27.430 --> 53:32.350
He doesn't want to be king.
Maybe he'll see it as a blessing.

53:32.430 --> 53:34.140
Finding out you've been lied to
your whole life?

53:34.230 --> 53:36.520
It won't feel like a blessing.

53:36.600 --> 53:39.900
This is going to make your career, Amber.

53:45.820 --> 53:48.530
Richard, I saw you come back last night
with that peasant.

53:48.620 --> 53:49.780
Peasant?

53:49.870 --> 53:52.540
Why don't you join us
in the 21st century, Sophia?

53:52.620 --> 53:54.710
- Always the rebel.
- Always will be.

53:56.210 --> 53:59.380
I know you better than anyone, Richard.

53:59.460 --> 54:01.880
I care more than anyone.

54:01.960 --> 54:03.880
We really do need to finish
your English lesson.

54:03.970 --> 54:04.800
Blah, blah, blah.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.720
I'll meet you in the library
in ten minutes.

54:08.180 --> 54:10.350
I do care, Richard.

54:10.430 --> 54:12.350
I seriously doubt that.

54:12.430 --> 54:13.560
Then let me show you.

54:19.520 --> 54:21.150
- What's the matter?
- You have to stop it, Sophia.

54:21.230 --> 54:22.150
It's not gonna work.

54:22.230 --> 54:24.650
But you need me.
You don't know how to be king.

54:24.740 --> 54:26.820
You'd love for me to believe that,
wouldn't you?

54:27.860 --> 54:31.030
[laughs] I did for a while.
I even believed that you loved me.

54:31.120 --> 54:34.580
But you love the spotlight
and you love the attention.

54:34.660 --> 54:36.540
And you're never gonna change.

54:36.620 --> 54:40.130
No. You are the one
that will never change, Richard.

54:40.210 --> 54:41.340
You'll fail without me,

54:42.340 --> 54:45.050
fall apart under the slightest bit
of pressure.

54:45.130 --> 54:47.130
You'll regret this!

54:47.220 --> 54:48.300
I'll take my chances.

55:10.490 --> 55:12.620
[cell phone rings]

55:15.410 --> 55:17.710
- Amber.
- Hey, Pop.

55:17.790 --> 55:19.870
Sorry I haven't had much time to check in.

55:19.960 --> 55:23.750
No problem.
How goes it with my hotshot reporter?

55:23.840 --> 55:26.710
Remember how you told me
I have to take chances to win?

55:26.800 --> 55:28.420
Words to live by.

55:28.510 --> 55:31.890
What if those chances ended up
hurting somebody who didn't deserve it?

55:31.970 --> 55:34.640
I think I'm gonna need more info
than that, baby.

55:34.720 --> 55:38.640
What if my story ends up hurting somebody
who's already been through a lot?

55:41.060 --> 55:43.770
Look, I don't know anything
about your job,

55:43.860 --> 55:47.570
but this I do know:
you gotta listen to your heart, Peanut.

55:47.650 --> 55:49.530
It'll always tell you the truth.

55:49.610 --> 55:52.870
Classic fatherly advice.

55:52.950 --> 55:55.330
Better than a fortune cookie, huh?

55:55.410 --> 55:57.290
[knock]

55:57.370 --> 56:00.410
Hey, Pop, I better call you back.

56:00.500 --> 56:01.330
I love you.

56:10.880 --> 56:11.720
Hi.

56:16.350 --> 56:18.060
Is there something I can do for you?

56:18.140 --> 56:20.600
I thought we might go for a walk.

56:20.680 --> 56:21.980
It's a lovely night outside.

56:23.190 --> 56:24.770
I don't know.

56:24.860 --> 56:26.230
Please?

56:26.320 --> 56:29.490
Just 20 minutes.
I could do with the company.

56:30.740 --> 56:32.360
Sure.

56:32.450 --> 56:33.320
Let me get my coat.

56:36.660 --> 56:38.290
[sighs]

56:40.500 --> 56:42.040
I was going to invite you
for a horse ride,

56:42.120 --> 56:45.080
but I think a walk
might be a little bit safer.

56:46.290 --> 56:47.340
Is everything all right?

56:48.920 --> 56:52.590
You often take the help
for romantic walks in the snow?

56:52.680 --> 56:54.090
What?

56:54.180 --> 56:55.340
Nothing, it's stupid.

56:56.800 --> 56:57.720
Please, talk to me.

56:59.430 --> 57:01.180
I feel like I've told you everything
about myself,

57:01.270 --> 57:04.400
and I know hardly anything about you.

57:04.480 --> 57:07.730
What would Lady Sophia say
if she saw us walking out here together?

57:07.820 --> 57:08.980
Why would it matter?

57:09.070 --> 57:10.400
I saw you two earlier.

57:11.530 --> 57:14.660
Whatever you think you saw,
there is nothing between Sophia and me.

57:16.530 --> 57:18.580
It didn't look that way to me.

57:18.660 --> 57:21.290
She was just trying to rekindle something
that isn't there anymore.

57:23.290 --> 57:26.000
Must happen to you a lot.
Women throwing themselves at your feet.

57:28.380 --> 57:29.550
Men too, sometimes.

57:30.840 --> 57:32.380
Well, what about you?

57:32.470 --> 57:35.260
A woman of your intelligence and beauty

57:35.340 --> 57:37.850
must have men throwing themselves at you.

57:37.930 --> 57:39.600
Not so much.

57:39.680 --> 57:43.020
It's simpler for me to focus
on my career at the moment.

57:43.100 --> 57:43.930
Your tutoring?

57:47.440 --> 57:49.730
I hope you'll come tomorrow night.

57:51.070 --> 57:54.490
- Tomorrow night?
- The Christmas Eve Ball.

57:55.990 --> 57:58.280
I'll feel a lot less nervous
to have you there.

57:58.370 --> 57:59.200
Richard.

58:00.740 --> 58:02.080
There's something I need to tell you.

58:10.670 --> 58:12.630
What was it you needed to tell me?

58:23.060 --> 58:24.270
[Simon] Are you sure about this?

58:24.350 --> 58:26.640
[Sophia] I'm telling you, there's
something off about this Martha Anderson

58:26.730 --> 58:28.440
and I'm going to get to the bottom of it.

58:32.190 --> 58:34.650
- What are we looking for, exactly?
- Anything.

58:34.740 --> 58:38.240
I know she's hiding something.
Here, look through this.

58:45.960 --> 58:48.250
Hmm...

58:51.790 --> 58:53.210
Hmm.

58:54.550 --> 58:56.260
Well, well, well.

58:58.010 --> 59:00.260
Looks like Christmas came early.

59:44.010 --> 59:46.220
I'm sorry for what I said
the day I left, Father.

59:49.310 --> 59:50.270
I know it hurt you.

59:52.690 --> 59:54.060
There's no way I can take it back.

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:03.570
I'll do as you wished.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:10.540
I'll accept the crown,
for you and for Mother.

01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:14.500
But I'll never measure up to you.

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:17.550
No one ever will.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.360
Hi.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:41.150
Hey. I was just getting dressed
for the ball.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.740
[grumbles]

It's this or sweats.

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:47.530
I suppose you're almost done
with your story.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:50.790
Almost.

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.170
Tonight we'll find out how it ends.

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:56.250
Then you'll be gone.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.170
And you'll never think about us again.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.090
Emily.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.340
How could I ever forget you?

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:07.640
No, never ever.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.690
This is for you. Merry Christmas, Amber.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.490
I don't have anything for you.

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:23.610
You've given me a lot.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.740
Don't pretend you learned anything
from me as a tutor.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.910
You told me that
everything's going to be okay,

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.200
even if my father's gone.

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:36.960
Even if I'm... different.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.090
Just open it.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.140
Emily.

01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:52.430
It's to remind you of our toboggan ride.

01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:55.390
Em...

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:02.070
What would I have ever done without you?

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.940
Spent Christmas in the dungeon, for sure.

01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:14.120

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:22.210
Meet Musette, Lisette, and Antonio.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:26.720
They do everything.
Hair, makeup, and gowns.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.930
As you Americans would say, "the works".

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:31.310
And they're gonna work on me?

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:33.470
Uh-huh.

I remember your father's coronation
at the Christmas Eve Ball.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:02:59.750
You're as handsome as he was.

01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:03.050
- If only I could stand half as tall.
- Oh, you will.

01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:04.460
Just takes a little time.

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:07.590
Good evening, Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.850
Prime Minister,
I look forward to working with you.

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:14.430
And I with you.

01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:16.680
Your Royal Highness.

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.720
She cleans up nicely.

Lipstick on a pig, as the saying goes.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.200
What are you waiting for?

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.300
Why are they staring?

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:35.350
'Cause you look perfect.

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:38.390
You don't look too shabby yourself,
Prince Richard.

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:40.980
Or should I call you King Richard II now?

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.850
You know what I think about titles.

- Serious?

As long as you promise
not to tread on my feet.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.600
[Amber chuckles]

01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:08.520
Aren't you worried
they're all talking about us?

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:10.110
They're saying you're out of my league.

01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:12.360
I'm sure.

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.780
I really wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:20.030
I think you're giving me more credit
than I deserve.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.740
I don't think so.
I'm comfortable with you.

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:25.500
You're more genuine
than anybody I've ever met.

On this glorious Christmas Eve,

in the season of hope and new beginnings,

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:35.570
His Royal Highness, Prince Richard,
son of King Richard I,

01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:37.400
presents his rightful claim

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:41.200
to the crown and throne
of the Kingdom of Aldovia.

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:55.840
Richard, do you pledge
your life and fealty to Aldovia

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.840
and all her subjects?

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.760
I do.

01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:03.010
Do you swear to protect her,

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:08.310
to uphold her sacred laws
in times of wealth or poverty,

01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:10.600

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.480
I do.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:20.200
If any of the peerage wish to dispute
Prince Richard's claim to the throne,

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:23.990
speak now, or forever stay silent.

01:08:24.069 --> 01:08:26.029

On what grounds?

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:35.250
I challenge on the grounds that
Prince Richard is not the rightful heir.

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:41.590
Because this fraudulent Christmas prince
is not the blood of the late king.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.390
This documentation states
that Prince Richard

01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:51.479

Where did you obtain this?

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:12.000
I obtained it by uncovering a scheme
by a journalist,

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.290
posing as a tutor to the princess.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.430

- Richard, wait!
- What for?

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:22.650
You have to know
that I didn't mean for this to happen.

- No.

I just don't understand
why you kept it a secret.

A month after we were married,
I was told I couldn't have children.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.450
I felt like such a disappointment.

So when we discovered

01:11:57.370 --> 01:11:59.960
that we could adopt in secret...

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:05.130
You were our dream come true.

But I can't stand here and say that
we kept it from you for your sake.

You were born in our hearts,
not anyone else's.

It wasn't right.
I know it was a mistake not to tell you,

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.740
but we...

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:40.370
we couldn't bring ourselves to do it.

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.590
And the throne?

01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:36.050
What do we do about Simon?

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:41.560
I won't let him win without a fight.

01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.910
Darling.

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:02.750
There.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.590
Now that we're married,
on to the business at hand.

01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:11.920
Well, the coronation cannot take place

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.880
until a majority of the king's
council officers are present.

01:14:14.970 --> 01:14:19.930
The interregnum will expire
this afternoon, so I suggest you hurry.

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:25.440
The law clearly states that the queen
must preside at the ceremony.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.850
And it's Christmas Day.

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:30.690
I don't care if it's Christmas.
Go get her.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.260
Hey, Amber, Merry Christmas.

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.090
It doesn't feel like Christmas.

01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:59.390
I'm at the airport waiting for my flight.

01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:02.430
Yeah? You got everything you need
for your story already?

01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:04.680
- And then some.
- That's good, right?

01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:07.100
[sobs]

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:08.600
Okay, not so good.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:11.360
Everything went wrong.

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:17.200
The person I was worried
about hurting just got crushed.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.860
It's probably not as bad as you think.

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:24.040
I failed, I bombed, I crashed and burned.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.580
So, it's a learning experience.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:31.380
You know, failures plant the seed
for greater successes down the road.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:32.290
I wish.

01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:39.380
- Wait a second. What did you say?
- It's a learning experience.

01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:41.300
No, the other part.

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:43.600
Failure plants the seed?

01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:47.640
What? Too cornball?

01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:51.350
No. Well, yes,
but it reminded me of a poem.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.240
[P.A.] Now starting initial boarding
for United flight 306 to JFK.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.660
"But from a seed, an acorn's gift,
the truth will flood."

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:04.700
Acorn.

01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:07.330
What? What acorn?

01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:08.370
"A secret...

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.960
and a love far greater than blood."

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:16.000
All right, Peanut,
you kinda lost me, baby.

01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:17.960
Sorry, Pop, I gotta go.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:31.350
- There has to be a quorum by now.
- The queen hasn't arrived yet.

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.560
[crowd murmurs]

01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:34.980
I demand this process be delayed.

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.360
You have no right to demand anything.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.780
Prince Richard is the rightful heir
to the throne.

01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:44.490
Actually, he's not.

01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:46.870
Prime Minister, I implore you
to put a hold on these proceedings.

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:50.790
Prince Richard, the law clearly states
that the heir to the throne

01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:53.460
must be a member of the royal bloodline.

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:57.170
The will of the late king
must be held in the highest regard.

01:16:57.250 --> 01:16:59.960
That is what the law states.

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:02.010
[all agree]

01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:03.640
Order!

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.060
Once we have a quorum,
the coronation must go on,

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.720
today, as planned.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.480
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:16.770
I know that it's confusing
because I was sent away,

01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:20.440
but you don't understand.
I need to talk with the queen.

01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:23.910
Remove yourself from the premises
before I have you removed.

01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:26.410
If I could just talk with her
for a few minutes.

01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:27.330
Well, she's not here.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:30.540
And if she were here,
she would have you thrown in the dungeon.

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:34.580
I know for a fact
that you do not have a dungeon.

01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:37.040
If you think for one minute they'll
forgive you after what you've done...

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:40.840
- I promise that I only meant...
- Your promises mean nothing.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.800
- You're a traitor.
- If you would just let me finish.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.340
I think I can prove that Richard
is the rightful king.

01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:48.720
Just please let me help.

01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:57.730
Don't touch that. Don't!

01:17:57.810 --> 01:17:59.360
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.110
Oh, my.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.920
Well, Prime Minister,
looks like you have your quorum.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.170
I don't care about what any of them say.
You're my king and my brother.

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:25.470
Thank you.

01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:28.390
[Prime Minister]
We must now bear witness

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:31.930
to the coronation
of King Richard's blood heir.

01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:38.400
Count Simon presents his rightful claim
to the crown and throne.

01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:46.070
Do you pledge your life and fealty
to Aldovia and all her subjects?

01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:46.990
I do.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.240
Do you swear to protect her,

01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:55.080
to uphold her sacred laws

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.290
in times of wealth or poverty,
peace or war?

01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:00.250
I do.

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:05.300
If anyone would wish to dispute
Count Simon's claim to the throne,

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.720
may they speak now,
or forever stay silent.

01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.520
- Then I proclaim you...
- [Averill] Stop!

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:22.270
[all murmuring]

01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:31.370
Have her removed immediately!

01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:33.450
You're not king yet.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.710
If you have something to say,
Miss Moore, say it now.

01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:46.460
Your Majesty, before he died,
the king amended the law

01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:49.720
to allow Prince Richard
to become his lawful successor.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.180
- [Helena] What? How...
- She's lying, just like she did before.

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.930
The queen is speaking, so zip it.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.230
Let me see that.

01:19:58.310 --> 01:20:00.480
It was inside the acorn,

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.650
the gift your husband meant to give you
last Christmas before he died.

01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:07.530
Read the decree.

01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:16.620
"Let us be bound in future by truth,
and truth alone.

01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:21.750
Let us light up the shadows of the past.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.130
Though my blood may not run in his veins,

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:27.840
Richard, Prince of Aldovia,

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.760
is my son.

01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:35.850
And while this order gives him
lawful right to my throne,

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.640
it is by his own attributes, his spirit,

01:20:41.730 --> 01:20:45.610
his sensitivity, intelligence,

01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:46.520
and heart

01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:50.700
that he earns this honor."

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.620
This woman lied to us before.

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.040
What makes anyone think
she's telling the truth now?

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.500
Because I believe her.

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:04.080
The order is marked
with the king's official seal.

01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:05.840
- Yes!
- [applause]

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:21.810
If we may pick up where we left off,
Your Royal Highness.

01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:23.060
By all means.

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.810
My wife and I will not allow this.

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:28.650
We will fight this side by side together.
We'll hire an army of lawyers!

01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:31.150
Make sure you get one
to handle our divorce.

01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:34.660
Sophia.

01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:37.280
[Simon] Sophia.

01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:40.660
- Sophia, wait! What about our honeymoon?
- Shut up, Simon.

01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:46.710
If any of those present wish to dispute
Prince Richard's claim to the throne,

01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:49.920
let them speak now,
or forever remain silent.

01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:57.850
By the power vested in me
as Prime Minister,

01:21:57.930 --> 01:22:02.770
I crown you Richard Bevan Charlton,

01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:05.480
King of Aldovia.

01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:12.230
Long live King Richard II.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.400
[all] Long live the king!

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:24.960
Long live the king!

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.080
And Merry Christmas to all.

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.050
[horns honking]

01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:41.260
[Amber] So, what did you think?

01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:46.060
It's a thoughtful, mature,
well-written story

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.150
that will never see the light of day.

01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:52.730
- What?
- It's a puff piece, Amber.

01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:55.950
Pure schmaltz. Not our brand.

01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:59.700
- But it's honest and it's the truth.
- You were at ground zero.

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:03.790
You had the adoption papers in your hands.

01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:05.330
You really blew it big time.

01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:08.080
But this is who he is.
This is what happened.

01:23:08.170 --> 01:23:10.040
I really don't care.

01:23:11.210 --> 01:23:14.800
In the meantime, I need you
to jump back on the copy desk.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.630
Ron's article needs a polish.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.550
You know what?

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.180
Find someone else to do your mop jobs.

01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:24.810
- Excuse me?
- I'm done.

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:34.320
[man] So, what are you gonna do?

01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:40.030
- Time to focus on my own work.
- That's what I've been saying all along.

01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:43.870
I'm gonna start with a blog
about King Richard, the real story.

01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:45.080
You're my hero.

01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:57.510
Happy almost New Year, everybody.

01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:59.510
[all] Happy almost New Year.

01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:01.050
[Rudy] Mm...

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:03.970
Rudy, as always,
your burgers are the best.

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:05.010
[woman] Yeah.

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:08.850
I figure we've got lots to celebrate,
now that my Peanut is back in town.

01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:11.100
And here's something else to celebrate.

01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:14.860
Your article just broke 20,000 likes.

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.030
Hey, that's terrific.

01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:17.530
Pop, it's really not that many.

01:24:17.610 --> 01:24:19.950
What are you talking about?
You only posted it three days ago.

01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:21.610
This thing's gonna catch fire.

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:23.660
And until you become rich and famous,

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.870
you've always got a job
working here with your Pop.

01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:27.290
[chuckles] I know.

01:24:27.370 --> 01:24:28.450
[thudding]

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:29.750
Hey.

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:34.540
- Those would be our dates.
- All right.

01:24:34.630 --> 01:24:36.210
You guys go have fun, huh?

01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.510
[kisses]

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.090
So, who's the third guy?

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:44.760
Just this hottie named Michael.
Not a setup.

01:24:44.850 --> 01:24:46.600
I'm not coming out, guys.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.850
Seriously?
You're gonna stay home on New Year's Eve?

01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:52.020
I just wanna help Pop clean up
and do some writing.

01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:55.770
How about we check back later,
maybe drag you out for after-parties?

01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:58.070
- Not gonna happen.
- You sure you're gonna be okay?

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.030
- Have fun, okay?
- Thanks.

01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:04.280
We will.

01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:06.830
[woman] Oh, my gosh.
I can't wait to hit up this new club.

01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:08.830
It's gonna be so much fun.

01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:11.120
Hey, how's it going?

01:25:11.210 --> 01:25:13.750
[man] I thought your girlfriend
was coming.

01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:22.590
[crowd cheering, whistling]

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.140
[man] Less than five minutes till we ring
in this new year, ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:28.930
That means it's time
to pour the champagne!

01:25:29.010 --> 01:25:32.730
- Who wants champagne?
- We need champagne!

01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:33.850
You're the best, Rudy!

01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.360
- [Rudy] Yay! Come on!
- [bottle pops open]

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.900
[Rudy] Let's have a great new year!

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.950
All right, let's pour it out.
All right, let's do it, let's do it.

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.910
Here we go!

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.910
[bell dings]

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.090
What are you doing here?

01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:00.750
I never had the chance to say goodbye.

01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:03.340
Or thank you.

01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:05.800
You don't have to thank me.

01:26:05.890 --> 01:26:08.350
I'm responsible for this whole mess
in the first place.

01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:12.220
No. You opened a door
that needed to be opened.

01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:14.100
That's what a great reporter does.

01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:18.650
Emily showed me your blog online.

01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:19.940
She did?

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:22.230
Why didn't you publish it
in your magazine?

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.400
Too much schmaltz.

01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:25.740
Schmaltz?

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.660
It means it was too sentimental.

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:31.620
I wrote the truth about you,
that you're kind, compassionate.

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:36.000
That you stole my cab,
and that you're gonna rule from the heart.

01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:39.170
Emily misses you terribly.

01:26:41.710 --> 01:26:42.630
So do I.

01:26:44.130 --> 01:26:45.550
I miss you too.

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.470
A palace is a lonely place for a king

01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:51.350
without a queen.

01:26:57.650 --> 01:26:59.810
But my whole life is in New York.

01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:02.320
Well, we can come back
as much as you want.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.740
But my career, I'm not ready to...

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.110
I don't want to make you
give up anything, Amber.

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.070
I could never leave my father.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.990
I can give him his own wing
at the palace.

01:27:13.290 --> 01:27:16.620
Or I could buy him
his own diner in Aldovia.

01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:18.500
Or we could just pick
this one up and move it.

01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.130
[laughs]

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:24.590
How long do you plan
to keep a king on his knees?

01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:29.340
You haven't thought about this.

01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:32.470
I mean, we barely know each other.

01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:36.270
I've never been more certain
of anything in my life.

01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:39.400
And I've been known to be indecisive.

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.440
Look, I know it's sudden, but...

01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:51.370
Is that a yes?

01:27:51.450 --> 01:27:52.280
Yes.

01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:55.290
Yes, yes, yes.

01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:11.180
[all] Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:15.810
five, four, three, two, one!

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:18.310
Happy New Year!

01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:22.060
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year, guys.

01:28:22.150 --> 01:28:23.480
Yeah!

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.270
Happy New Year!

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.990
- Happy New Year!
- Wow, we made it. We made it.
