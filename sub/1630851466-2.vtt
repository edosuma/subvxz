Come on, man.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.609
Breaking news.

00:38.609 --> 00:41.909
Around 3 a.m. near Hakdong Intersection
in Cheongdam-dong,

00:41.909 --> 00:44.880
Jang Min Ho, a member
of a popular idol group Blitz was...

00:44.880 --> 00:47.549
hit by a truck and has passed away.

00:47.890 --> 00:50.460
The police said illegal drugs were
found in his possession...

00:50.460 --> 00:52.560
- at the time of his discovery.
- I knew it.

00:52.560 --> 00:55.229
That's why
he got into that accident.

00:55.229 --> 00:58.000
The biggest domestic drug dealer,
the so-called Mr. Yoon,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.969
is now openly wanted
as the provider of the drugs.

01:04.069 --> 01:06.370
(Episode 2)

01:12.709 --> 01:14.180
Hello, Ji Hyuk.

01:15.010 --> 01:18.719
I didn't introduce myself properly
due to our hectic schedule.

01:19.420 --> 01:23.590
Well, I double-majored
in Physics and Computer Science.

01:23.659 --> 01:26.689
I was with Intelligence and Analysis
before I came here.

01:27.129 --> 01:30.060
So I'm rather useful
in searching for information...

01:30.060 --> 01:31.560
and analyzing them.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.329
That's enough.

01:33.530 --> 01:35.569
Oh, okay.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.269
- Excuse me, Ji Hyuk.
- Yes?

01:40.439 --> 01:42.010
Are you all right?

01:42.439 --> 01:44.840
You don't look too well.

01:45.379 --> 01:46.879
I'm fine.

01:58.060 --> 02:00.019
Listen up to what I'm about to say.

02:00.359 --> 02:02.489
You'll only get one chance.

02:03.730 --> 02:06.299
There's a rat in our agency.

02:07.370 --> 02:09.629
And I deleted...

02:11.400 --> 02:13.039
my own memories...

02:14.139 --> 02:15.939
to find the traitor.

02:23.050 --> 02:25.050
The situation you're involved in.

02:25.819 --> 02:27.590
There is a traitor
behind everything.

02:29.689 --> 02:32.259
You must find that traitor.

02:32.259 --> 02:35.430
Let me see. That one.

02:36.060 --> 02:39.159
I'm not sharing
everything I found out so far...

02:39.159 --> 02:42.069
to prevent prejudice
from clouding up your judgment.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.469
It might hinder the process
as you look for the traitor.

02:51.909 --> 02:54.250
There is one thing
you must find out.

02:54.909 --> 02:58.449
That there was one last piece
of the puzzle I could not find.

03:01.590 --> 03:04.759
To complete the puzzle,
I need that piece.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.830
Never forget...

03:13.500 --> 03:15.370
that to doubt is to survive.

03:16.370 --> 03:19.639
You must be suspicious
of every move, word,

03:20.199 --> 03:22.909
and breath from
everyone who approaches you.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.599
(National Security,
the Only Way to Protect Our Country)

03:54.139 --> 03:55.169
I didn't know...

03:55.870 --> 03:57.240
that you were already back at work.

03:57.979 --> 03:59.039
How impressive.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.479
Don't forget my warning.

04:07.219 --> 04:08.250
Never.

04:16.029 --> 04:17.029
Yes, sir.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.800
Rewind everything back to square one.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.439
And rethink it.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.339
When you really need me,

04:30.009 --> 04:31.709
you'll see me again then.

04:33.410 --> 04:34.480
No doubt about it.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.360
How long has it been...

04:50.129 --> 04:51.399
since you got transferred
to our team?

04:51.529 --> 04:54.629
It's been about a year now.

04:54.899 --> 04:56.100
It's been that long?

04:57.100 --> 04:59.269
Gosh. Time flies, doesn't it?

05:01.240 --> 05:02.269
That's for you.

05:06.839 --> 05:09.250
How's managing your own team?

05:10.620 --> 05:11.879
It's fine, sir.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.220
I'm sure you know Han Ji Hyuk.
Don't you?

05:18.120 --> 05:21.129
You worked together on the same team
before you got transferred here.

05:21.560 --> 05:22.589
Yes, we did.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.060
I had dinner with the deputy commissioner
last night.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.500
And the deputy commissioner seemed
interested in him.

05:31.139 --> 05:34.370
You must think
I'm discriminating against you...

05:34.740 --> 05:36.310
because you were never one of us.

05:39.439 --> 05:40.480
So you must...

05:41.310 --> 05:42.949
become one of us now.

05:44.319 --> 05:46.649
I am well aware of your ability.

05:52.189 --> 05:53.620
I understand...

05:54.689 --> 05:55.860
fully.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.699
I will...

06:04.540 --> 06:05.769
look into it.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.019
That's it?

06:19.550 --> 06:22.649
You still have no idea
what the problem is.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.189
Hatred.

06:27.189 --> 06:28.990
I see your personality
is still the same.

06:29.730 --> 06:30.759
Greed.

06:34.569 --> 06:35.870
Are you sure...

06:36.930 --> 06:38.769
you won't regret this decision?

06:39.339 --> 06:40.399
Obstinacy.

06:43.310 --> 06:45.279
Don't fixate
on finding your answer outside.

06:45.740 --> 06:48.810
Perhaps,
you might be able to find it,

06:48.980 --> 06:50.750
somewhere close and unexpected.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.269
Never forget that...

07:15.769 --> 07:19.040
you must be suspicious
of every move, word,

07:19.480 --> 07:22.509
and breath from
everyone who approaches you.

07:25.079 --> 07:26.120
(Contacts)

09:01.350 --> 09:02.350
Hello, sir.

09:06.049 --> 09:07.049
Where is it?

09:07.889 --> 09:08.889
This way, sir.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.269
This is Mr. Yoon.
He's been dealing our stuff.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.039
He distributed them
all over the country.

09:31.409 --> 09:33.840
Who are you?

09:34.710 --> 09:36.509
Why are you doing this?

09:36.649 --> 09:38.250
You stupid scumbag.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.950
You still haven't learned
your lesson?

09:39.950 --> 09:41.090
That's enough.

09:44.059 --> 09:45.120
My apologies, sir.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.490
You jerks.

09:47.759 --> 09:50.129
Do you think
you'll get away with this?

09:53.299 --> 09:55.629
Do you think my guys will
just sit back and watch?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.580
Do you remember the idol singer
who got high,

11:20.580 --> 11:22.750
hit by the car
on the street, and died?

11:26.590 --> 11:30.460
I came across this
when I was backtracking his dealer.

11:32.830 --> 11:35.169
I think the police can handle that.

11:35.799 --> 11:37.200
Take a look at this.

11:38.870 --> 11:40.399
(Jang Gwang Cheol)

11:40.870 --> 11:41.940
What's this?

11:42.809 --> 11:45.539
This is Jang Gwang Cheol,
second-in-command of Huayang Gang.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.139
Huayang Gang?

11:47.240 --> 11:51.080
That's right. It's the gang
Ji Hyuk was after a year ago.

11:52.580 --> 11:53.779
Why are these guys here?

11:54.190 --> 11:55.250
Actually, there were rumors...

11:55.419 --> 11:58.259
that a Chinese drug cartel, a key player
in dealing meth from North Korea,

11:58.259 --> 12:00.519
was planning to make a move in Korea.

12:01.029 --> 12:02.429
And that drug cartel is Huayang Gang?

12:02.429 --> 12:05.600
It hasn't been confirmed,
but given the looks of it, yes.

12:10.370 --> 12:13.169
Won't the deputy commissioner
want to put Ji Hyuk on this case...

12:13.169 --> 12:15.210
once she finds out about this?

12:15.470 --> 12:19.379
Well, he was the only one
who dealt with Huayang Gang.

12:20.779 --> 12:23.179
Get to the point.

12:23.649 --> 12:24.649
Let me...

12:25.419 --> 12:26.750
handle this one.

12:27.889 --> 12:31.159
If you give me your word,
I'll get Jang Gwang Cheol right now.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.519
How many do you need?

12:33.759 --> 12:34.860
I just need three guys
from the observation post.

12:34.860 --> 12:36.730
And the rest will be handled
by the cops.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.730
Gosh. No way.

12:44.169 --> 12:45.940
That was so cool. Nice.

12:47.710 --> 12:48.970
(And he's hot too.)

12:48.970 --> 12:50.269
(Who is this master of martial art?)

12:51.809 --> 12:53.610
What? Come on.

12:53.980 --> 12:56.679
You'll end up suffering if you keep
eating things like this. Like me.

12:56.779 --> 12:58.620
You should eat real food.

12:58.620 --> 13:00.990
- This is confiscated.
- Put it back.

13:02.350 --> 13:04.960
We're going to have lunch.
Do you want to join us?

13:05.620 --> 13:07.190
Okay, sure.

13:08.289 --> 13:10.029
That was good.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.899
All I do is eat when I come to work.
My gosh.

13:16.730 --> 13:19.600
You came in four years after me,
so I can speak with you comfortably?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.240
Of course.

13:21.240 --> 13:24.840
I haven't seen your partner around.
Did something happen?

13:24.980 --> 13:28.879
Well... To be honest,
I didn't get to talk to him a lot.

13:29.149 --> 13:32.850
Did you hear the rumors
floating around about him?

13:32.850 --> 13:34.320
What rumors?

13:37.320 --> 13:41.190
This is something I heard from
my colleague in that division.

13:41.490 --> 13:43.629
In Libya... Wait, was it Libya?

13:43.629 --> 13:47.100
In any case, he went
into a terrorist hideout there...

13:47.100 --> 13:48.600
all by himself,

13:48.830 --> 13:51.370
and killed a dozen of people.

13:51.370 --> 13:53.240
No way.

13:53.370 --> 13:55.009
You really didn't hear anything?

13:55.409 --> 13:59.080
I've even heard that he shot
someone in a moving train.

14:00.179 --> 14:02.779
Makes sense. He was a star agent,

14:02.779 --> 14:06.549
so I'm sure he's not satisfied
being stuck in a place like this.

14:06.549 --> 14:08.620
What's wrong with our team?

14:10.149 --> 14:12.620
Are you really asking us that?

14:12.620 --> 14:14.490
Honestly, they call us a team,

14:14.490 --> 14:17.929
but we're nothing more
than an employment agency...

14:18.159 --> 14:21.629
that goes in to fill in
for other people.

14:21.899 --> 14:23.730
I heard you were in
Intelligence and Analysis.

14:23.730 --> 14:27.240
- Yes.
- People are dying to go there,

14:27.240 --> 14:28.809
so why did you come here?

14:28.809 --> 14:29.870
Pardon?

14:30.440 --> 14:33.509
I just thought it would be cool...

14:33.809 --> 14:35.279
to work in the field.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.100
Hey! How long has it been?

14:53.100 --> 14:55.100
I seriously thought you were dead.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.129
I can't believe I'm seeing you here.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.440
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.000
- Is this it?
- Yes.

15:00.669 --> 15:02.570
This is the information related to
the Brown Bear Project...

15:02.570 --> 15:04.240
your team was in charge
of a year ago.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.879
The security level for this
is really high,

15:06.879 --> 15:09.679
so I had to screenshot
everything to print it out.

15:09.679 --> 15:11.379
Thanks for this.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.450
Do you need anything else?

15:16.690 --> 15:18.190
This is our security pass.

15:18.190 --> 15:20.960
I'm sure there's a record of someone
losing their pass recently.

15:21.190 --> 15:22.889
Can you find out who that is?

15:23.389 --> 15:25.629
I need to ask
the management team about this.

15:25.629 --> 15:27.100
Is it okay if it takes some time?

15:27.870 --> 15:29.200
It doesn't matter.

15:29.200 --> 15:32.299
Just wire me two and half big ones
for all of this.

15:33.269 --> 15:36.240
I already wired you five big ones.
Your account number hasn't changed.

15:37.039 --> 15:38.940
This is why I like you so much.

16:07.370 --> 16:10.210
I've met all sorts of people
in my time,

16:11.740 --> 16:14.240
but I've never seen someone
as tight-lipped as you.

16:18.279 --> 16:21.750
You said you're looking into
Huayang Gang, right?

16:22.519 --> 16:24.990
I heard they were really dangerous.

16:26.789 --> 16:28.159
You can't be sure about that.

16:29.529 --> 16:31.929
When you start digging
into something,

16:32.559 --> 16:36.129
you'll end up bumping into another wall
that stops you.

16:37.470 --> 16:38.639
But this time,

16:39.470 --> 16:40.870
something is different.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.879
Huayang Gang is nothing more
than a branch.

16:46.179 --> 16:50.049
I feel like there's something
even bigger underneath it.

16:54.549 --> 16:56.419
No, I'm fine.

17:09.170 --> 17:12.400

Just know that from
this moment on...

Director Kim Dong Hwan
was attacked by a blunt weapon...

17:24.009 --> 17:27.680
and murdered by unknown assailants
in a hotel room in Dandong.

17:28.619 --> 17:30.289
What's more shocking...

two of our agents,

17:33.660 --> 17:35.829

and Lee Byung Soo...

17:36.089 --> 17:38.130
were also ruthlessly murdered
on the same day.

17:39.799 --> 17:42.670
Based on the fact that
multiple agents were murdered...

17:42.670 --> 17:45.069
on the same day in the same way,

17:45.740 --> 17:47.640
the agency suspects that a list
of our agents have been leaked...

17:47.640 --> 17:49.569
and is taking this situation
very seriously.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.349
You only have one mission.

17:56.849 --> 17:59.319
Make them pay
for what they have done.

18:01.220 --> 18:02.920
From this moment, this project...

18:03.549 --> 18:06.819
will assume Director Kim Dong Hwan's
code name...

his favorite criminal informant.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.589

begging for food...

18:43.589 --> 18:45.359

in Huayang Gang now.

You guys are the ones who did that
to Director Kim, aren't you?

19:08.849 --> 19:10.119
Find out...

19:12.359 --> 19:14.289
who was involved...

19:15.589 --> 19:16.890
and how.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.839
(Hwang Mo Sool, Second-in-command)

19:29.940 --> 19:31.480
(Ri Sung Min,
North Korean Narcotics Factory)

19:39.519 --> 19:41.690
(Second-in-command)

19:41.720 --> 19:44.150
One, two, three.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.440
- Hwang Young?
- Who are you?

20:40.480 --> 20:42.279
The beginning of the memory
that I lost...

20:50.619 --> 20:51.690
Who was...

20:52.519 --> 20:53.589
that man?

21:07.640 --> 21:10.039
We were looking into Huayang Gang.

21:12.339 --> 21:13.410
Right.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.880
I should start there.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.450
(A photo of Huayang Gang's
Jang Gwang Cheol)

21:27.259 --> 21:29.930
Check the products that just came in
and wait for me to call.

21:30.589 --> 21:31.630
Yes, sir.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.369
(Our Central Market)

21:41.000 --> 21:42.039
(Jang Gwang Cheol)

21:42.609 --> 21:44.369
It's him.
It's definitely Jang Gwang Cheol.

21:44.509 --> 21:46.740
Okay.
Call the Drug investigation Unit.

21:46.740 --> 21:47.809
Yes, sir.

21:48.410 --> 21:51.109
This is Alpha. We verified him.
You can go in now.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.140
Get him!

22:58.220 --> 22:59.250
I found him!

23:01.589 --> 23:03.289
Hey! Stop right there!

23:08.759 --> 23:10.359
Darn it!

23:32.150 --> 23:33.220
Darn it.

23:39.019 --> 23:40.859
Son of a gun!

23:43.829 --> 23:44.859
Get out of the car!

23:45.529 --> 23:46.599
Get out!

23:47.230 --> 23:49.630
- Get out of the car!
- Darn it!

23:50.299 --> 23:52.839
Get away! I'll stab you.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.910
- Get out!
- Get out of the car!

24:00.140 --> 24:03.210
Hey. You can stop now.

24:05.279 --> 24:06.819
Everyone, step back.

24:07.750 --> 24:08.750
My goodness.

24:09.690 --> 24:11.019
Maybe he's a criminal.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.490
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

24:14.259 --> 24:16.430
Look at him. He must a bad man.

24:17.829 --> 24:19.660
I can't believe it. He's a criminal.

24:22.269 --> 24:23.329
Hey.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.799
- Put your hands up.
- Don't shoot me.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.240
I'm just the driver.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.619
This is 112. What's your emergency?

24:43.720 --> 24:45.460
Hello? Please go ahead and speak.

24:48.559 --> 24:51.900
Release Jang Gwang Cheol
who is being detained...

24:53.230 --> 24:54.829
at Namburo Police Station.

24:55.430 --> 24:57.299
Immediately deport him
back to his country...

24:58.539 --> 25:00.240
without conditions.

25:01.170 --> 25:04.210
Could you be more specific
about your emergency?

25:04.210 --> 25:05.279
If you don't,

25:06.210 --> 25:07.509
we will kill a police officer.

25:08.079 --> 25:09.750
Keep this in mind.

25:10.579 --> 25:12.250
Until you release Jang Gwang Cheol,

25:13.150 --> 25:14.650
you will lose one officer every day.

25:16.589 --> 25:17.789
And this is...

25:19.019 --> 25:22.490
the first present for you.

25:23.730 --> 25:24.730
Hello?

25:25.400 --> 25:26.500
Hello?

25:29.829 --> 25:31.269
Are you feeling all right?

25:32.769 --> 25:34.740
Yes, I'm fine.

25:36.670 --> 25:39.180
Can you prescribe me
something stronger than methadone?

25:39.180 --> 25:40.779
It doesn't help even when
I take several pills.

25:40.779 --> 25:43.710
If you depend on it,
your body won't withstand it.

25:44.049 --> 25:45.480
How're the tremors in your hands?

25:46.250 --> 25:48.049
I don't have them anymore.

25:48.390 --> 25:50.650
Has any of your memories
returned recently?

25:54.490 --> 25:57.930
Okay. You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.200
But please remember this.

26:02.230 --> 26:04.700
The facts stored in your brain...

26:04.700 --> 26:08.509
are the combination
of your memories and emotions.

26:08.740 --> 26:10.609
But your case is unusual.

26:11.410 --> 26:15.410
Your memories are completely lost,
but you still remember the emotions.

26:16.109 --> 26:19.980
Anger, vengeance,
and sadness are still there.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.490
But you have no idea where
these emotions are coming from.

26:25.559 --> 26:27.890
The power of emotions
is stronger than memories.

26:28.430 --> 26:31.359
You should keep your mind clear...

26:31.359 --> 26:33.730
so your memories won't be
swept by your emotions.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.329
The power of emotions
is stronger than memories...

26:37.329 --> 26:39.569
Are you trying to say my memories...

26:39.569 --> 26:41.569
can change according to my emotions?

26:41.839 --> 26:42.910
That's right.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.339
Memories aren't
as solid as you think.

26:45.339 --> 26:47.210
They're more like soft clay.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.779
That means
their shape can easily be changed.

27:01.829 --> 27:03.230
Yes. What is it?

27:03.430 --> 27:05.130
Where are you?

27:05.299 --> 27:07.430
I think you have to
come to the office right now.

27:12.400 --> 27:15.069
(National Intelligence Service)

27:21.210 --> 27:23.109
Follow me. The deputy commissioner
wants to see us.

27:26.220 --> 27:27.279
Refuse it.

27:28.690 --> 27:31.990
Whatever the deputy commissioner
wants you to do, refuse it.

27:32.220 --> 27:34.359
This isn't something you can handle
in your state.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.500
Keep that in mind. I'm warning you.

27:42.930 --> 27:44.299
Who's the IO at Daehan Daily?

27:44.299 --> 27:45.299
Tell the IO
to remove the article now.

27:45.299 --> 27:46.369
(An intelligence officer
who gathers domestic intelligence.)

27:48.269 --> 27:49.269
Call him.

27:49.940 --> 27:51.009
Is he on the line?

27:54.440 --> 27:56.009
Thank you. You may leave.

28:01.819 --> 28:02.849
My apologies...

28:03.049 --> 28:05.559
for summoning you like this.
I should've called you earlier.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.829
We'll talk later.
Please take a seat.

28:08.829 --> 28:09.829
Yes, ma'am.

28:17.369 --> 28:19.799
You must have noticed it already...

28:20.740 --> 28:22.839
the agency is having
a bit of trouble.

28:23.109 --> 28:25.980
We all know each other well
so I'll get to the point.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.079
Put it on the screen.

28:31.079 --> 28:32.579
(Jang Gwang Cheol)

28:32.579 --> 28:34.980
Can you recognize who it is?

28:38.250 --> 28:40.660
His real name isn't Jang Gwang Cheol
but Choi Gwang Cheol.

28:40.890 --> 28:43.960
He wasn't born in Yanji City, China.
He was born in Vladivostok.

28:44.630 --> 28:47.700
He was born to an ethnic Korean father
and a Russian mother.

28:47.829 --> 28:50.529
He killed his father with his bare hands
as a teenager.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.269
Apparently, he changed
his surname after that.

28:56.369 --> 28:59.980
He got into the Russian mafia
in the Far East.

29:00.140 --> 29:03.279
He joined Samhwa Gang in Yanji City
then got in Huayang Gang.

29:03.279 --> 29:06.019
The boss of Huayang Gang
trusts him the most.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.349
He's second-in-command of the gang.

29:09.349 --> 29:10.349
Director Kang.

29:10.789 --> 29:11.789
Three days ago,

29:11.789 --> 29:14.789
the police arrested him
while he was in our country.

29:15.059 --> 29:17.359
He's in police custody right now.

29:19.329 --> 29:21.029
But something came up.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.240
Release Jang Gwang Cheol
who is being detained...

29:27.799 --> 29:29.470
at Namburo Police Station.

29:29.710 --> 29:33.039
Immediately deport him back to
his country without conditions.

29:33.710 --> 29:36.279
If you don't,
we will kill a police officer.

29:37.250 --> 29:38.579
Keep this in mind.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.819
Until you release Jang Gwang Cheol,
you will lose one officer every day.

29:43.250 --> 29:45.920
And this is the first present...

29:47.359 --> 29:48.759
to you.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.900
It's the voice of Officer Kim Jin Ho
from Yoocheon police substation.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.000
They captured Officer Kim
when he was on patrol...

29:58.799 --> 30:00.970
and forced him to make the call.

30:01.240 --> 30:04.940
And as they warned us,
they killed Officer Kim.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.819
He was stabbed
in his neck, chest, and stomach.

30:15.079 --> 30:17.690
We found more than 30 stab wounds
on his body.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.930
Jang Gwang Cheol is in our custody
but he's not saying anything.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.700
It's getting closer to the time
that they warned.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.400
Not only the police
but our agency is...

30:29.400 --> 30:31.670
I know. We're panicking.

30:34.740 --> 30:37.910
Because he's someone
we've never dealt with before.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.509
This is drastic
even for Huayang Gang.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.609
It's highly possible
Jang Gwang Cheol has...

30:44.609 --> 30:47.250
an important piece of information
that can't be exposed.

30:47.450 --> 30:49.490
So what is
that piece of information?

30:49.619 --> 30:51.549
Only two things matter to them.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.259
It's either related to their interests...

30:53.690 --> 30:55.430
or related to their boss Hwang Mo Sool.

30:55.430 --> 30:57.490
I'm sure it's related to either of them.

31:00.329 --> 31:03.230
Ma'am, that's groundless speculation.

31:05.369 --> 31:08.170
Huayang Gang is
like a predator in their world.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.640
Our government authority isn't
as powerful as China's.

31:13.809 --> 31:15.849
So I don't think
we can deal with them...

31:15.849 --> 31:17.480
through a legal process.

31:21.220 --> 31:22.220
So?

31:22.220 --> 31:25.460
First, we need to find out
what's in Jang Gwang Cheol's head.

31:25.460 --> 31:26.859
And when we do,

31:28.390 --> 31:30.829
we'll be able to turn the tide
of this fight.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.539
I want to interrogate
Jang Gwang Cheol. Let me do it.

31:41.539 --> 31:42.609
No.

31:43.309 --> 31:44.609
I can't allow that.

31:46.009 --> 31:48.509
- Your personal agenda...
- Yes, you can do it.

31:50.279 --> 31:51.880
Interrogate him yourself.

31:51.880 --> 31:55.619
Ma'am, this isn't
what we've discussed.

31:55.990 --> 31:58.519
He can't be sent to the field
in his state.

31:58.519 --> 32:00.019
Do you have any other suggestions?

32:02.160 --> 32:04.660
Which one of us do you think
can deal with them?

32:06.259 --> 32:09.200
We don't have time
to sit and chat like this.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.130
- Chief Ha.
- Yes, ma'am.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.369
Take him
to the police station right now.

32:14.740 --> 32:16.509
And as for the interrogation,

32:17.740 --> 32:19.180
let him do it.

32:24.910 --> 32:26.220
Why aren't you answering me?

32:28.019 --> 32:29.019
Yes, ma'am.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.619
If there's no other suggestion,
let's end the meeting.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.019
Han Ji Hyuk!

32:35.359 --> 32:36.789
You little son of a gun.

32:39.599 --> 32:42.130
Did you think I was joking?
I told you to refuse it.

32:42.269 --> 32:44.500
Do you think I don't know
you have other intentions?

32:44.900 --> 32:47.240
Maybe you can't grasp the situation
because the boss favors you.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.940
This might cost
both of our jobs in an instant.

32:49.940 --> 32:52.710
So what you're about to do?

32:52.710 --> 32:54.309
You need to stop it here. Okay?

32:59.019 --> 33:01.450
- That's odd.
- What?

33:02.720 --> 33:06.259
The one who killed three agents
and threw our agency in confusion...

33:07.589 --> 33:09.930
appeared right before our eyes.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.829
You look as if you're fine with it.

33:18.839 --> 33:21.400
Chief Ha, you should be
up against them, not me,

33:21.400 --> 33:22.869
at least in this moment.

33:23.539 --> 33:25.039
Do you think you're such a hot shot?

33:26.180 --> 33:29.309
Let's wait and see
how long you can keep your calm.

33:41.289 --> 33:43.589
Three, two, one.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.160
The end. Let's go home.

33:46.460 --> 33:49.069
Great work today.

33:49.230 --> 33:51.430
- Let's go home.
- Time to leave.

33:52.970 --> 33:54.000
Aren't you leaving?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.140
I have nothing else to do
in particular.

33:56.470 --> 33:57.940
And Ji Hyuk isn't back either.

33:57.940 --> 34:00.079
Goodness, what a loyal partner.

34:00.079 --> 34:02.380
So what? Nobody cares.

34:02.380 --> 34:04.950
- Keep it up.
- Yes, goodbye.

34:04.950 --> 34:06.049
Hyo Eun.

34:06.750 --> 34:08.250
I'm so sorry,

34:08.519 --> 34:11.889
but may I take a look
at your old case files?

34:13.289 --> 34:16.329
It's my first time working
in the field, so I wanted to study.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.559
Why didn't you ask me sooner?

34:19.460 --> 34:20.559
I'm sorry.

34:23.269 --> 34:25.900
(Kind police for our citizens)

34:27.599 --> 34:29.440
Please don't mind him.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.269
He just became sensitive...

34:31.269 --> 34:33.480
because his colleagues were killed.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.739
This way, please.

34:49.260 --> 34:51.429
He refused to eat
ever since he got here,

34:51.429 --> 34:53.130
and he won't say a thing.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.829
We've been through
our highs and lows,

34:57.130 --> 34:59.170
but we've never met anyone
as tenacious as him.

34:59.570 --> 35:01.670
What's your plan?

35:01.670 --> 35:04.610
- We'll go in...
- No, I'll go in alone.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.849
Please turn off all CCTVs in there.

35:09.849 --> 35:13.420
Well, we have rules to follow too.

35:13.420 --> 35:16.889
We'll be responsible for everything
that happens from now on.

35:17.050 --> 35:18.750
So please proceed.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.590
And remove his cuffs too.

35:21.690 --> 35:24.190
- His handcuffs?
- Hey, Ji Hyuk.

35:43.710 --> 35:44.949
Hey, Jang Gwang Cheol.

35:57.389 --> 35:59.559
No, your real name is
Choi Gwang Cheol.

36:13.710 --> 36:15.139
What's with that guy?

36:16.110 --> 36:19.250
Your henchmen killed
a police officer to save you.

36:19.449 --> 36:22.820
I know this isn't the mainland,
but it's still excessive.

36:24.719 --> 36:26.920
Why do you take things this far?

36:36.530 --> 36:38.800
All right, we have plenty of time.

36:40.739 --> 36:42.440
You have quite a history.

36:44.340 --> 36:47.340
You've been in and out
of Russia Federal Prison,

36:51.579 --> 36:54.219
And you've spent a few years
in Shenyang Prison.

36:57.789 --> 37:00.489
I hear people in your field
tattoo your history.

37:00.489 --> 37:01.519
Right?

37:03.130 --> 37:05.360
Let me find out
what your past is like.

37:15.940 --> 37:17.869
At first, you started
as a petty pickpocket.

37:19.710 --> 37:21.679
Then you came of age in prison.

37:22.550 --> 37:25.579
So you started off
as nothing but a petty thief?

37:25.719 --> 37:27.219
I'm a little disappointed.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.760
Most clever people
learn to avoid serving time.

37:35.190 --> 37:37.389
You must've been
addicted for a while.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.400
Is that why you've been
breaking out in cold sweat?

37:41.300 --> 37:43.030
Because of your withdrawal?

37:46.269 --> 37:49.639
If you haven't served time for that,
you must've been careful,

37:50.309 --> 37:51.969
unlike how you look.

37:56.349 --> 37:58.550
And you even served time for rape?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.719
And your victim was...

38:04.449 --> 38:05.550
a man.

38:07.159 --> 38:09.329
Hey, just out of curiosity.

38:09.329 --> 38:12.030
Did your sexual preference change
after serving in prison for long?

38:12.030 --> 38:13.130
Or...

38:16.170 --> 38:18.599
is it because of what your dad did
when you were young?

38:19.840 --> 38:22.440
You jerk!

38:39.159 --> 38:41.059
Hey, what are you doing?

38:44.690 --> 38:45.730

- Detective Hwang.
- Yes?

39:05.750 --> 39:07.949
I looked everywhere,
but I can't find it.

39:08.619 --> 39:11.050
What can't you find? What is it?

39:11.119 --> 39:14.190

a hatchet was used.

39:47.989 --> 39:49.429
You know what?

39:49.889 --> 39:51.090
A wild dog...

39:52.659 --> 39:56.230
sometimes hunts down its prey
even though it won't eat it.

39:57.099 --> 39:59.469
How would I know why it does that?

40:06.940 --> 40:08.880
You need to come here.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.250
What is it?

40:10.849 --> 40:12.780
Well, it's...

40:13.550 --> 40:17.150
I lived in a border town
called Kraskino as a kid.

40:17.519 --> 40:19.320
It was freezing in winter,

40:19.760 --> 40:22.460
so it'd usually snow up to here.

40:23.289 --> 40:25.030
One day, I woke up...

40:25.159 --> 40:28.699
and found dozens
of sheep and goats...

40:29.170 --> 40:32.469
we kept in that town
completely annihilated.

40:32.940 --> 40:34.800
We came to found out
that the day before,

in a nearby mountain...

40:38.369 --> 40:42.610

The mother wild dog
who lost its babies...

40:48.480 --> 40:51.519
came down into the town at night
and killed all the animals.

40:52.889 --> 40:53.889
Now.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.530
Listen up.

40:57.730 --> 40:58.960
A wild dog...

40:59.599 --> 41:02.230
never kills without a reason.

41:02.769 --> 41:07.000
It's just that idiots like you
have no idea what the reason is.

41:52.550 --> 41:56.849

just found in your jurisdiction.

this belonged to the victim.

in the Foreign Intelligence Bureau?

46:35.659 --> 46:37.869
- What was his name?
- You mean Han Ji Hyuk?

if I should be telling you this.

I mentioned earlier.

But I don't think he knows anything.

but he's got a nasty temper.

before his boss is released.

three years ago from Jilin.

to this job by his hometown friend.

for staying in Korea illegally.

1:01:36.630 --> 1:01:37.730
Wait for me.

1:01:38.199 --> 1:01:39.670
I'll come and find you soon.

1:04:45.889 --> 1:04:46.920
Yes.

1:04:48.219 --> 1:04:49.320
Lee Choon Gil.

1:04:51.130 --> 1:04:52.429
It was him.

1:05:10.849 --> 1:05:13.750
(The Veil)

1:05:44.179 --> 1:05:46.409
I'm taking my hands off this case
as of today.

1:05:46.409 --> 1:05:48.250
Don't you want to find out...

1:05:48.250 --> 1:05:50.320
the next move he'll make?

1:05:50.320 --> 1:05:53.420
Let me be a part
of what you're about to do.

1:05:53.750 --> 1:05:55.789
Don't get too close to him.

1:05:55.789 --> 1:05:59.360
He said the entire nation
will be in shock very soon.

1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:02.030
This is pure insanity.

1:06:02.030 --> 1:06:04.929
You were going to fight them
without bracing yourself?

1:06:04.929 --> 1:06:06.400
I'm headed there now.

1:06:06.699 --> 1:06:08.199
Come out now. Hurry.

1:06:08.199 --> 1:06:11.010
Do you still think there's hope?
