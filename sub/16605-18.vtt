Captain Syndulla was specific
about this being my operation

The astromech that
triggered the alarm

on Killun station arrived
aboard this shuttle.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.820

on identified rebel droids.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.957
Hmm, quite a unique model.

04:53.926 --> 04:54.993
Out of date.

I believe this C1 astromech
is the droid infiltrator

referenced

05:02.836 --> 05:05.904
in his memo about the rebels

I will alert
the station at once.

05:10.477 --> 05:14.012

from that spy.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.950
Yes, the simplicity
of the structure.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.687
How I do miss
Imperial hallways.

doing here?

05:32.199 --> 05:34.266

two inventory units

05:34.268 --> 05:35.834
were assigned to this level.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.103
Uh, well,
it is unfortunate,

05:38.105 --> 05:39.805
but I must report,

05:39.807 --> 05:43.108
you have been reassigned
to the cargo platform.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.843
I am your replacement.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.945
I understand.

05:49.015 --> 05:53.785
I can't believe
I'm the same model
as that Imperial drone.

05:53.787 --> 05:57.055
The Empire never did
take droids seriously.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.158
That alone explains
all of Chopper's success.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.028
I, on the other hand,
use my superior intellect

this mission by myself.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.048
is attempting to access
the network.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.217
Perfect.
This means I can now

06:25.219 --> 06:28.420
extract the location of the
rebel base from its memory.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.664
Sir, there are
no base coordinates

06:39.666 --> 06:41.032
stored on this droid.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.769
If it cannot divulge
the location of
their rebel base,

06:43.771 --> 06:46.004
then I will use it
to lead us there.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.412

but ultimately futile.

what do we have here?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.067
Just as I suspected.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.804
All talk, no action.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.606
And while you were wasting
your time here,

07:21.608 --> 07:23.575

07:23.577 --> 07:25.377
Oh, so now
you're ignoring me?

07:25.379 --> 07:28.713
Now that I have clearly
proven why I am leader,

07:28.715 --> 07:30.449
I suggest you admit failure

07:30.451 --> 07:32.551
and return with me
to the shuttle.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.387
Fine. Have it your way.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.489
Controller, I've verified it.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.758
That inventory droid
has accessed

07:39.760 --> 07:41.793
Lothal orbital clearance codes

07:41.795 --> 07:43.295
from the main computer.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.130
There is a danger.

07:45.132 --> 07:49.935
I calculate a 31% risk
of the rebels successfully
using the codes,

07:49.937 --> 07:53.805
but we have an 82% chance
of learning the location
of their base

07:53.807 --> 07:56.775
if we let them escape
and track them.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.010
The odds are with us.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.488
I have successfully
retrieved the codes.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.423
We must leave at once.

08:11.425 --> 08:12.991
Wait, where's Chopper?

Well, it is about time.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.839
Yes. And now he's
admitting that

08:27.841 --> 08:30.041
I am the better leader?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.810
All right, then,
this should be

08:31.812 --> 08:33.211
a painless flight
back to base.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.328
<i>Good job.</i>
Thanks, Captain Syndulla,

09:23.330 --> 09:25.063
but your two droids
did all the work.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.766
Technically, one droid
did all the work.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.669
That would be me, AP-5.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.905

We'll be there
within the hour.

Thanks for the drink, Chop.

09:49.455 --> 09:51.022
Where was this
attitude earlier?

09:51.024 --> 09:53.959
That is an excellent question,
Lieutenant.

09:53.961 --> 09:58.430
This new attitude of his
feels insincere to me.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.732
Hey, it's better than before.

Now, if you could upgrade

<i>In fact, I am the reason</i>
<i>my mission was successful.</i>

10:10.744 --> 10:13.278
This inventory droid
is a complication

10:13.280 --> 10:14.913
that could ruin my plan.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.282
We must appease him.
For now.

up to, C1-10P!

10:42.141 --> 10:44.175
Look, AP,
this childish competition

10:44.177 --> 10:46.144
between you and Chopper
has gone too far.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.846
It's got to stop.

10:47.848 --> 10:51.149
This has become much more
than a game, Lieutenant.

may have been

10:53.320 --> 10:55.920

You are paranoid.
Get your sensors checked.

We don't have much time,
so here's what I know.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.489
I saw Chopper plugged
into a network terminal.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.192
When I found him,
he was strangely silent,

11:34.194 --> 11:37.662
but I thought he was
merely ignoring me,
as usual.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.165

an Imperial term.
