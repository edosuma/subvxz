00:08.068 --> 00:10.137
<i>
This is Munich, Germany...</i>

00:11.241 --> 00:12.862
<i>...where 12 new teams</i>

00:12.965 --> 00:15.586
<i>are headed to the</i> Amazing Race <i>
starting line,</i>

00:15.689 --> 00:17.586
<i>Bavarian-style.</i>

00:17.689 --> 00:19.103
Use those long legs, bae.

00:19.206 --> 00:22.137
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:22.241 --> 00:25.241
- We are Team Miami in the house.
- Miami.

00:25.344 --> 00:26.862
"Raised on <i>croquetas."</i>

00:26.965 --> 00:28.620
<i>We've been together 13 years,</i>

00:28.724 --> 00:31.172
<i>and we've been married
six of those years.</i>

00:31.275 --> 00:33.137
I am a professional dancer.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.689
<i>I am currently
on tour with Pitbull.</i>

00:35.793 --> 00:37.068
And I am a firefighter.

00:37.172 --> 00:38.862
<i>I've been a firefighter
for 12 years.</i>

00:38.965 --> 00:40.482
We are grateful
for this opportunity,

00:40.586 --> 00:42.862
and we're gonna,
you know, kick some butt.

00:42.965 --> 00:44.000
:
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:44.103 --> 00:44.965
All right,
what's winning so far?

00:45.068 --> 00:46.068
<i>Big Brother</i> or this?

00:46.172 --> 00:47.275
- Yeah, yeah. Come on.

00:47.379 --> 00:48.689
Are you kidding me? Fresh air?

00:48.793 --> 00:50.103
- Get out of here.

00:50.206 --> 00:53.034
We met on the reality TV show <i>
Big Brother,</i>

00:53.137 --> 00:55.896
<i>and we've been dating
for the past eight months.</i>

00:56.000 --> 00:58.965
<i>
Claire is the smartest girl
I've ever met.</i>

00:59.068 --> 01:00.620
<i>
I work in software and tech.</i>

01:00.724 --> 01:02.379
<i>I do machine learning.</i>

01:02.482 --> 01:03.517
<i>
You're the brains
of the operation.</i>

01:03.620 --> 01:05.000
<i>
Yeah. You're the muscle.</i>

01:05.103 --> 01:06.551
It does concern me a little bit
if I'm the muscle.

01:06.655 --> 01:08.862
- That is, that is true.

01:08.965 --> 01:12.241
-♪ ♪
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:12.344 --> 01:14.931
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Oh!

01:15.034 --> 01:17.103
<i>
Wait, I'm sorry.
Are we going down?</i>

01:20.448 --> 01:22.310
- Is there no seat belt?!

01:38.034 --> 01:39.413
<i>
Holy crap.</i>

01:39.517 --> 01:41.206
<i>We are doing</i>
The Amazing <i>freaking</i> Race.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.482
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:43.586 --> 01:45.068
Go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go.

01:53.344 --> 01:55.965
I would like to officially
welcome you

01:56.068 --> 01:58.068
to the start
of your <i>Amazing Race</i>

01:58.172 --> 01:59.827
here in Munich, Germany.

02:03.517 --> 02:04.793
A lot of history here.

02:04.896 --> 02:07.931
This is home
to the largest beer festival

02:08.034 --> 02:09.517
in the world, Oktoberfest.

02:09.620 --> 02:13.586
And you are about to be part
of some Munich history

02:13.689 --> 02:15.206
when you take part in this race.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.103
We have highly
competitive people here.

02:20.206 --> 02:23.655
Rex, Tim,
you guys know about competition?

02:23.758 --> 02:26.310
For those of you who don't know,
I was a head coach

02:26.413 --> 02:28.793
<i>in the National Football League
for eight years--</i>

02:28.896 --> 02:31.965
<i>six with the New York Jets,
two with the Buffalo Bills.</i>

02:32.068 --> 02:33.862
I'm Tim Mann.
I'm a probation officer

02:33.965 --> 02:35.448
for the state of Tennessee.

02:35.551 --> 02:37.275
So I got paired up
with Rex on the golf course.

02:37.379 --> 02:39.586
<i>We golfed together and became
good friends after that.</i>

02:39.689 --> 02:41.448
<i>
I truly believe
we can win this race.</i>

02:41.551 --> 02:42.793
Look, I-I thought my team

02:42.896 --> 02:44.000
was gonna win the Super Bowl
with the Jets.

02:44.103 --> 02:45.206
So maybe it ain't gonna happen.

02:45.310 --> 02:46.241
- No, I'm just kidding.

02:46.344 --> 02:48.379
But I truly think we can.

02:48.482 --> 02:49.793
We're Team T-Rex.

02:49.896 --> 02:53.034
This dinosaur is gonna
devour the competition.

02:53.137 --> 02:55.827
I'm not used to seeing
you without the headset on.

02:55.931 --> 02:57.793
Are you gonna be
barking out orders to people?

02:57.896 --> 02:59.793
- This guy right here, for sure.
- Just me.

03:01.172 --> 03:03.172
- Ah! I'm Abby.
- I'm Will.

03:03.275 --> 03:06.241
I-I see you found it very
difficult to contain yourself.

03:06.344 --> 03:08.241
We've been watching this
since we met.

03:08.344 --> 03:09.655
We've known each other
for 20 years.

03:09.758 --> 03:10.896
We've been dating
for eight of those.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.620
We're high school sweethearts.

03:12.724 --> 03:14.172
- It can be hard to get
a word in with Abby, but...

03:14.275 --> 03:16.103
- Sorry.

03:16.206 --> 03:17.896
It is a dream of ours
to be on the show,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.241
and it's gonna be awesome
to run a race with this girl,

03:20.344 --> 03:21.724
- who's so passionate
about everything.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.344
- Aw.

03:23.448 --> 03:25.689
Now, I know you both
have got some dance moves.

03:25.793 --> 03:27.793
- Yeah.

03:27.896 --> 03:29.482
Um, my name is Quinton, and...

03:29.586 --> 03:32.344
- I'm Mattie.
- And we are both
former, um, NFL cheerleaders.

03:32.448 --> 03:34.068
- For the Los Angeles Rams, baby.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.517
For the Los Angeles Rams, baby.

03:35.620 --> 03:37.551
I met this lovely girl.
She was my captain.

03:37.655 --> 03:39.000
And we've been
best friends ever since.

03:39.103 --> 03:40.758
- Wow.
- Awesome.
- All right.

03:40.862 --> 03:43.379
- Let's talk about the sisters.
An amazing story.

03:43.482 --> 03:44.862
I'm Molly. This is Emily.

03:44.965 --> 03:47.034
And we are
identical twin sisters.

03:47.137 --> 03:49.275
We just met one year ago.

03:49.379 --> 03:50.275
- Whoa.

03:50.379 --> 03:51.793
Wow.

03:51.896 --> 03:54.482
We were adopted from South Korea
and separated at birth.

03:54.586 --> 03:58.241
<i>Molly was adopted to
a Jewish family in Florida,</i>

03:58.344 --> 04:02.586
<i>and I was adopted to
a Jewish family in Pennsylvania.</i>

04:02.689 --> 04:05.379
We grew up not knowing
that one another existed.

04:05.482 --> 04:07.034
And as adults,

04:07.137 --> 04:11.068
<i>uh, discovered one another when
my daughter took a DNA test.</i>

04:11.172 --> 04:13.758
<i>Being on the</i> Race <i>
gives us a unique opportunity</i>

04:13.862 --> 04:16.896
to make up for 36 lost years.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
How amazing that you get
this opportunity together, huh?

04:20.103 --> 04:22.275
- Yeah. This is truly a gift.
- Yeah.

04:23.379 --> 04:25.034
My dad and I are immigrants.

04:25.137 --> 04:26.344
Which is, I mean, I don't know
if you can tell

04:26.448 --> 04:27.827
- where we're from...
- We're from Jamaica.

04:27.931 --> 04:29.000
...but we are from Jamaica.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.620
We've always traveled

04:30.724 --> 04:32.758
- vicariously
through <i>Amazing Race.</i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:32.862 --> 04:34.517
- Now we're doing it on <i>
The Amazing Race.</i>
- On <i>The Amazing Race.</i> Yeah.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.172
- I love it.
- Yeah.

04:36.275 --> 04:38.448
Looking forward to learning
more about all of you

04:38.551 --> 04:42.275
along the way, but right now
we have a race to get started.

04:42.379 --> 04:44.620
There are a lot of
firsts on this race.

04:44.724 --> 04:47.655
This is the first time ever
that we have started

04:47.758 --> 04:50.379
- outside the United States.

04:50.482 --> 04:53.724
The other thing that's new
and different about this race

04:53.827 --> 04:56.379
is that you can
complete the challenges

04:56.482 --> 05:00.103
on this first leg of the race
in any order that you want to.

05:00.206 --> 05:01.448
- Wow.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.034
It's called the Scramble.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.620
<i>
The Scramble. That's something
different where I was excited.</i>

05:06.724 --> 05:09.172
- I was like, "Let's do this."
Bring it.
- Yeah, I was so excited.

05:09.275 --> 05:10.827
- Wow.
- Wow. Wow.

05:11.862 --> 05:14.034
The other thing you should know
is, for the first time

05:14.137 --> 05:16.724
in <i>Amazing Race</i> history,

05:16.827 --> 05:21.551
there are
no non-elimination legs.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.862
- Ooh!

05:23.965 --> 05:26.172
Okay. We got to be on our A-game

05:26.275 --> 05:27.862
- every single time.
- Every single leg. Yeah.

05:27.965 --> 05:31.448
If you arrive last,
you will be eliminated.

05:31.551 --> 05:33.172
- This is do-or-die, you know?
- Yeah.

05:33.275 --> 05:34.620
Because there is
no other chance.

05:34.724 --> 05:38.655
When I say go,
you can run around the fountain

05:38.758 --> 05:40.068
and go over to your bags.

05:40.172 --> 05:41.896
On top of your bags,
you'll see an envelope.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.448
Inside the envelope
are three addresses

05:45.551 --> 05:47.413
for the challenges
that you need to complete.

05:47.517 --> 05:50.103
You can
complete those challenges

05:50.206 --> 05:51.551
in any order you want.

05:51.655 --> 05:54.241
When you do, you will have
the clues you need

05:54.344 --> 05:55.896
to find me at the Pit Stop.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.344
Now, you're gonna be making
your way around Munich

05:59.448 --> 06:02.827
in one of the cars that's
parked in the lot over there.

06:02.931 --> 06:04.517
Is everybody ready to race?

06:10.413 --> 06:12.965
The world is waiting for you.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.310
Good luck.

06:14.413 --> 06:16.068
Travel safe.

06:19.758 --> 06:20.965
Go!

06:24.172 --> 06:26.172
Let's go!

06:26.275 --> 06:28.103
Here we go.

06:28.206 --> 06:30.000
I'm ready, let's go.

06:32.655 --> 06:34.655
- oh, my God.
- Go.

06:34.758 --> 06:36.724
- Love and light.
- Route Info.

06:36.827 --> 06:38.137
"Get ready to scramble."

06:38.241 --> 06:40.827
"Use the map in your car
to drive to each challenge

06:40.931 --> 06:42.689
- in any order you wish..."
- Okay.

06:42.793 --> 06:43.827
"...to find your clues."

06:43.931 --> 06:45.827
"The challenge locations are...

06:45.931 --> 06:47.310
<i>Roll at Luitpoldpark."</i>

06:47.413 --> 06:48.931
<i>
"Saw at Biergarten Seehaus."</i>

06:49.034 --> 06:52.344
<i>"Smash at
Augustiner-Keller Biergarten."</i>

06:54.172 --> 06:58.172
This is arguably the tastiest
beverage on the planet.

06:58.275 --> 07:00.275
Ice-cold beer--

07:00.379 --> 07:02.827
<i>the number one
ingredient at Oktoberfest.</i>

07:02.931 --> 07:04.275
<i>Prost!</i>

07:04.379 --> 07:06.689
<i>This Scramble
requires teams to complete</i>

07:06.793 --> 07:08.793
<i>three Oktoberfest-inspired
tasks.</i>

07:08.896 --> 07:10.482
<i>Roll a beer keg</i>

07:10.586 --> 07:12.931
<i>through an obstacle course
in under one minute.</i>

07:13.034 --> 07:14.551
<i>Saw through a log.</i>

07:14.655 --> 07:17.896
<i>And smash
an enormous block of ice.</i>

07:18.000 --> 07:20.275
<i>Once complete,
they'll have the three parts</i>

07:20.379 --> 07:23.655
<i>of a clue they need
to find me at the Pit Stop.</i>

07:23.758 --> 07:25.896
We don't know what
the challenges entail.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.379
It just tells us where it is,

07:27.482 --> 07:29.344
and then we should get
our clues when we get there.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.241
- All right.
- Let's go.

07:31.344 --> 07:32.862
<i>Scramble was mind-blowing.</i>

07:32.965 --> 07:35.689
Now you have to decide what
order you're going to things.

07:35.793 --> 07:37.413
- Go. Go.
- Let's do this, baby.

07:39.448 --> 07:41.172
I am not generally
a patient person.

07:41.275 --> 07:43.620
<i>So when I identified
Luitpoldpark,</i>

07:43.724 --> 07:45.241
looking at the map, I'm like,
"Let's just go right now.

07:45.344 --> 07:46.241
"'Cause I can get us there.

07:46.344 --> 07:47.413
<i>We'll get there fast."</i>

07:47.517 --> 07:48.896
All right, let's do it.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.034
Yeah. Let's think about this
before making a decision.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.827
- Can you help us
find some locations?
- Yeah, of course.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.275
We're trying to find
these three locations.

07:54.379 --> 07:55.931
If you can help us
mark it on our map,

07:56.034 --> 07:57.310
we would love you forever.

07:57.413 --> 07:59.034
<i>
We had a strategy, and it was</i>

07:59.137 --> 08:01.241
asking for all these
extensive directions

08:01.344 --> 08:02.689
to all these
different locations.

08:02.793 --> 08:05.827
"Altstaädten l..." Oh, my God.
German is so fun.

08:05.931 --> 08:07.344
So, Luitpoldpark is right there?

08:07.448 --> 08:10.000
We got directions
to all three of those places,

08:10.103 --> 08:12.137
<i>and then we got
further directions</i>

08:12.241 --> 08:13.931
<i>on how to travel
to those places.</i>

08:14.034 --> 08:16.206
We're Asian kids.
You know, we're overachievers.

08:16.310 --> 08:17.620
Like, all we do is study.
So we're like,

08:17.724 --> 08:19.275
"Oh, how do we get
extra credit on this race?"

08:19.379 --> 08:22.448
Okay, so that's the exact place
of number one.

08:22.551 --> 08:23.827
Luitpoldpark, right here.

08:23.931 --> 08:25.172
Right here. Look, look, look.
It's right there.

08:25.275 --> 08:26.931
- This one? Okay.
- Circle that, yeah.

08:27.034 --> 08:28.551
Can you look this up for us?

08:28.655 --> 08:31.517
Our strategy is find out where
these locations are on a map.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.965
<i>We don't want to have to stop
and ask for more directions.</i>

08:34.068 --> 08:35.482
All right, Claire, what's your
stress level right now?

08:35.586 --> 08:37.310
Once we get out,
I'll feel better.

08:39.655 --> 08:40.689
<i>This is crazy!</i>

08:41.655 --> 08:43.103
No.

08:43.206 --> 08:45.034
- Any-any-any order
you-you want to go in.
- Oh.

08:45.137 --> 08:47.068
We're on <i>The Amazing Race!</i>

08:49.655 --> 08:51.241
Okay, so we're here.

08:51.344 --> 08:52.862
<i>Phil's always
at a nice scenic spot,</i>

08:52.965 --> 08:56.241
<i>so I figured this one
is closest to the river.</i>

08:56.344 --> 08:58.344
<i>
The Pit Stop
might be somewhere nearby,</i>

08:58.448 --> 08:59.689
so let's save that for last.

08:59.793 --> 09:01.586
- We're going to Smash first.
- Smash?

09:01.689 --> 09:03.034
- Here we go.

09:03.137 --> 09:04.827
And then we're gonna do, um...

09:04.931 --> 09:07.482
Biergarten Seehaus
to Luitpoldpark.

09:07.586 --> 09:10.000
<i>- Molly, we're
on</i> The Amazing Race! <i></i>

09:10.103 --> 09:12.000
So now let's see what we can do.

09:14.517 --> 09:16.206
- All right,
we're going to Roll. <i>
- We picked Roll first</i>

09:16.310 --> 09:18.551
<i>because that was the first one
that we found.</i>

09:18.655 --> 09:19.896
We just were like,
"All right, go for it."

09:20.000 --> 09:21.724
Let me just
figure out where we are.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.931
- I know this is beside the
point, but your hair is so cool.
- Yeah.

09:24.034 --> 09:25.517
- You're so wonderful.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

09:29.862 --> 09:30.896
Uh, we're from Los Angeles.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, cool.

09:32.103 --> 09:34.103
Babe, you're gonna make a right.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.137
<i>
We got to do them
in different orders.</i>

09:36.241 --> 09:38.068
<i>- Yeah. Definitely.
- Whatever order we choose.</i>

09:38.172 --> 09:39.413
- Definitely.
- Man. That's a game changer.

09:39.517 --> 09:40.655
We don't know how many teams

09:40.758 --> 09:42.103
- are in front of us right now.
- Yeah.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.172
And we're just, we're just
trying to get on the road

09:43.275 --> 09:44.275
- and get going.
- Yeah.

09:44.379 --> 09:45.620
Thank you so much.

09:45.724 --> 09:46.586
- Thank you, thank you...
- Of course. Good luck.

09:46.689 --> 09:48.034
Are we the last to leave?

09:48.137 --> 09:49.689
<i>- Yes, we are.</i>

09:49.793 --> 09:53.241
But slow and steady wins
the race on <i>The Amazing Race.</i>

10:44.448 --> 10:45.482
Breaking news.

10:45.586 --> 10:47.137
This just in. Scramble.

10:47.241 --> 10:49.068
They give us all three addresses

10:49.172 --> 10:52.482
and we just go
in whatever order we want.

10:52.586 --> 10:55.172
You know, German is such
a fun language, you know?

10:55.275 --> 10:57.275
Like, say, like,
butterfly in Spanish,

10:57.379 --> 10:59.931
it's <i>mariposa.</i> In French,
it's <i>le papillon.</i>

11:00.034 --> 11:02.793
In-in German, you know
what it is? It's <i>Schmetterling.</i>

11:02.896 --> 11:04.965
<i>Nina and I met on a dating app,</i>

11:05.068 --> 11:07.172
<i>and we've been together
for four years.</i>

11:07.275 --> 11:09.000
<i>- We recently got engaged.
- We did.</i>

11:09.103 --> 11:10.172
We're so different. I mean...

11:10.275 --> 11:12.034
Aastha is very spiritual.

11:12.137 --> 11:14.482
<i>- She grew up Hindu.
- I've meditated
two hours a day</i>

11:14.586 --> 11:15.482
<i>for the past ten years.</i>

11:15.586 --> 11:17.379
<i>That keeps me focused.</i>

11:17.482 --> 11:19.551
<i>
I'm probably gonna
skip over things accidentally,</i>

11:19.655 --> 11:21.310
but Aastha's going
to be able to slow us down,

11:21.413 --> 11:22.586
and then lead
us to the finish line.

11:23.586 --> 11:26.000
We're going to Luitpoldpark.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.379
Luitpoldpark? All right.

11:27.482 --> 11:29.275
We lived here before.
I was stationed here.

11:29.379 --> 11:30.689
Member of
the United States Army.

11:30.793 --> 11:32.620
Michael and I are
both active duty military.

11:32.724 --> 11:34.000
<i>Air Force and Army.</i>

11:34.103 --> 11:35.586
<i>The active duty part,</i>

11:35.689 --> 11:37.103
<i>there's a great deal of family</i>

11:37.206 --> 11:38.413
<i>and personal sacrifice.</i>

11:38.517 --> 11:39.413
<i>We only see each other</i>

11:39.517 --> 11:40.655
<i>once or twice per year.</i>

11:40.758 --> 11:42.206
The ultimate goal
is just to have fun

11:42.310 --> 11:44.241
and just reconnect
with each other.

11:45.275 --> 11:47.241
<i>Park it, right here.
Park it, right here. Right here.</i>

11:47.344 --> 11:49.724
- It's out here.
- It said "Roll."

11:49.827 --> 11:51.551
- Red and yellow,
right here, right?
- Look for "Roll."

11:51.655 --> 11:53.655
- Hey, found something.
- I see it. I see it.

11:54.896 --> 11:57.172
<i>"Roll a beer keg
through the slalom course.</i>

11:57.275 --> 11:59.068
<i>"Cross the finish line
before the clock runs out</i>

11:59.172 --> 12:00.689
<i>to receive a piece
of the Pit Stop clue."</i>

12:00.793 --> 12:01.758
Let's go.

12:01.862 --> 12:03.137
I see a sign.

12:08.931 --> 12:11.137
Hello!
- Hello.

12:13.310 --> 12:14.241
Okay.

12:14.344 --> 12:15.724
Up, up, up, up.

12:20.793 --> 12:21.931
I got to go run down there.
He's gonna run back.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.655
<i>In less than 55 seconds.</i>

12:23.758 --> 12:24.655
All right.

12:29.827 --> 12:31.482
- Oh...

12:44.862 --> 12:46.344
Come on, Marcus.

12:46.448 --> 12:48.758
I was just like, "Screw that hay
bale. We're just going over it."

12:50.862 --> 12:52.413
It's not good.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.137
- How would you ever think that

12:55.241 --> 12:56.448
that was the right thing to do?

12:56.551 --> 12:57.724
Oh, let me just toss
this bad boy.

12:57.827 --> 12:59.034
It's an obstacle course
for a reason.

12:59.137 --> 13:01.310
We'll try it again.

13:03.068 --> 13:04.689
<i>I'm centering myself
on my breath</i>

13:04.793 --> 13:08.310
and focusing on
remembering why I'm here,

13:08.413 --> 13:10.689
who I am,
and my power and my strength.

13:10.793 --> 13:12.724
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

13:12.827 --> 13:14.862
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

13:14.965 --> 13:17.655
We have known
each other for eight years,

13:17.758 --> 13:21.379
<i>and we're actually coming up
on our third-year anniversary.</i>

13:21.482 --> 13:24.482
<i>We work together
as motivational speakers.</i>

13:24.586 --> 13:26.482
We go to schools
and we help students realize

13:26.586 --> 13:28.689
<i>that they are important
and that they matter.</i>

13:28.793 --> 13:33.379
<i>And I must say, Dom has a fire
that most people do not have.</i>

13:33.482 --> 13:37.275
It's just this internal flame
that just, ooh, gets really hot.

13:37.379 --> 13:38.931
- And... Yes.
- Tends to burn a little bit.

13:39.034 --> 13:40.689
- I-Is this it? "Kleinhesselohe."
- Yep.

13:40.793 --> 13:42.137
<i>- Yep, that's it. Yeah.
- Okay. "Seehaus."</i>

13:42.241 --> 13:43.620
"Biergarten." Come on,
come on, let's do this.

13:43.724 --> 13:45.172
- Okay. Okay.
-  Yes.

13:45.275 --> 13:47.275
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

13:47.379 --> 13:48.896
- L... L...
- Love and light.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.413
Love and light. Okay. Go.
Here, here, here.

- Hello.

14:00.896 --> 14:02.862

- Thank you. Danke.

14:06.482 --> 14:08.241
Thank you. Danke.

14:08.344 --> 14:09.896
- We're gonna just
crush it. Let's do it.
- Okay.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.655
Grab that side.

14:11.758 --> 14:14.379
We're gonna put the saw right
here, and then this, it's all...

14:14.482 --> 14:15.827
It's a teamwork motion, okay?

14:15.931 --> 14:17.551
So, look, look.
We're gonna do this.

14:17.655 --> 14:18.724
- Back and forth,
back and forth, okay?
- Okay, got it.

14:18.827 --> 14:19.827
Until the whole thing's done.

14:19.931 --> 14:21.551
- Teamwork. Pull.

14:21.655 --> 14:23.103
You got to pull. Pull.

<i>We had to saw off
a really thick piece of log.</i>

14:25.931 --> 14:28.965
We don't stop.
This is a workout.

14:29.068 --> 14:30.448
I love a good workout.

14:30.551 --> 14:32.034
Yeah.

14:34.413 --> 14:35.862
We got to go up and down
in 55 seconds.

14:44.413 --> 14:46.655
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on.

14:57.172 --> 14:59.793
You've done it! Fantastic!

15:01.068 --> 15:02.586
This is for you, okay?

15:02.689 --> 15:04.275
All right. "To cross
Luitpoldbruücke."

15:04.379 --> 15:06.379
- They'll add up...
and be a full sentence.
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:06.482 --> 15:08.034
Okay.

15:08.137 --> 15:11.034
I haven't worked out
in nearly two months,

15:11.137 --> 15:13.034
'cause I was in the field,
sleeping on a tank.

15:16.241 --> 15:17.793
<i>
We are making an assumption</i>

15:17.896 --> 15:19.413
<i>that the Pit Stop
is gonna be near the park.</i>

15:19.517 --> 15:21.689
We're gonna go to the closest
one, then the farthest one,

15:21.793 --> 15:24.172
then the park where-where we
think the Pit Stop is gonna be.

15:24.275 --> 15:26.448
If we can ever get started going
in the right direction,

15:26.551 --> 15:28.413
we'll be okay.

15:28.517 --> 15:30.862
- Here we go.
- The good teams don't worry
about the other teams, Rex.

15:30.965 --> 15:32.931
Yeah, who-who told you that?

15:33.034 --> 15:35.241
- We're gonna roll.
- We're gonna roll.

15:35.344 --> 15:37.034
Okay. Got it.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.862
I hope it's a dance challenge.

15:38.965 --> 15:40.517
I am a dance studio owner

dance companies in Los Angeles.</i>

- No, you're good. You're good.

36:52.931 --> 36:54.379
Hey, what's up, girl?

36:56.551 --> 36:57.586
Good job, baby.

37:01.586 --> 37:03.000
It's okay. It's okay, babe.

37:03.103 --> 37:05.896
- You got it, baby.
- Go!

37:12.862 --> 37:14.482
- Hey!
- Oh.

37:16.172 --> 37:19.413
- You got it!
- Yeah!

37:19.517 --> 37:21.206
<i>Team Croqueta came by,
literally came in,</i>

37:21.310 --> 37:23.827
<i>- did it one time, and they left.
- Yeah, one. Yeah.</i>

37:23.931 --> 37:25.379
And we were like, "Aah!"

37:25.482 --> 37:27.379
Phil, we're coming!

37:27.482 --> 37:29.724
- Let's go.

37:29.827 --> 37:32.379
Welcome. Feel good?

37:32.482 --> 37:34.000
I think as far
as the challenges go,

37:34.103 --> 37:36.000
- we... beasted 'em.
- We beast it. Beast it.

37:36.103 --> 37:37.448
This is our dress rehearsal.

37:48.758 --> 37:49.931
Yes!

37:53.034 --> 37:55.275
Oh.

37:56.586 --> 37:58.310
Why is that so hard?

37:58.413 --> 38:01.724
- So the bridge is south of us.
- We're close.

38:01.827 --> 38:03.137
Okay. Stay on Widenmayer

38:03.241 --> 38:04.655
'cause that's the street
we want to be on.

38:06.068 --> 38:08.310
<i>
It was like, okay, now I got to
do it. I know the technique.</i>

38:08.413 --> 38:10.068
<i>I know the physics.
I got to do it this time.</i>

38:16.000 --> 38:18.068
- Here. Here. Here.
- Run, run, run, run,
run, run, run, run.

38:18.172 --> 38:19.793
- Run, run, run, run!

38:22.172 --> 38:24.034
- Yeah! Yeah!

38:24.137 --> 38:25.724
Oh, my God.

38:25.827 --> 38:29.000
- We got it! We got it!
We got it.
- Oh!

38:30.655 --> 38:31.896
"Who wants to chill?"

38:32.000 --> 38:33.344
- You want to chill.
- I want-want to chill.

38:33.448 --> 38:36.586
- Go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go!

38:36.689 --> 38:37.827
There you go, babe.

38:40.655 --> 38:41.862
- Got it.

38:41.965 --> 38:43.448
Let's go!

38:45.758 --> 38:47.413
We have to go that way.

38:47.517 --> 38:49.448
Thought it said
the crosswalk was underground.

38:49.551 --> 38:51.275
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's underground.

38:51.379 --> 38:52.551
- Yes, we do see
another team.
- That team right there.

38:52.655 --> 38:55.724
Okay, Dad, we can beat them.

38:55.827 --> 38:57.379
- We're going there.
We're going there.
- Cross now.

38:57.482 --> 38:58.620
I think Phil's over there.

38:58.724 --> 39:01.068
- Did you see the sisters yet?
- No.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.551
Cross right here.

39:05.655 --> 39:07.586
Nice. Land. Beautiful.

39:07.689 --> 39:08.758
We have another team coming in.

39:08.862 --> 39:12.344
- Oh. Hey, guys.
- Hey.

39:12.448 --> 39:16.000
- Oh, you guys are breathing.
- This was a tiring day.

39:16.103 --> 39:17.517
- This was...
this was hard, for sure.
- Oh.

39:17.620 --> 39:18.689
There's no underground thing.

39:18.793 --> 39:19.827
That's not
an underground thing.

39:19.931 --> 39:20.793
We got to turn around.

39:20.896 --> 39:23.655
- Yeah.
- Come on, Mike.

39:23.758 --> 39:25.137
So we got to cross on this side?

39:29.931 --> 39:31.551
Classic.

39:31.655 --> 39:34.517
- All right.
- Phil.

39:34.620 --> 39:36.068
Wow, look at this.

39:36.172 --> 39:37.655
- Bring it in, bring it in.
- Here he comes.

39:37.758 --> 39:39.000
Had a good day?

39:39.103 --> 39:41.551
Dying for beer,
but had a great day.

39:41.655 --> 39:42.586
Here comes another team.

39:44.896 --> 39:46.896
- Abby,

39:47.000 --> 39:48.344
Will, I thought you guys
were gonna pass out

39:48.448 --> 39:49.689
at the start of the race.

39:49.793 --> 39:51.413
I mean, you looked so excited.

39:51.517 --> 39:52.896
And there's another team
right now.

39:54.965 --> 39:57.793
Make some space. Let 'em in.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.034
Crosswalk is
located underground.

40:00.137 --> 40:02.862
Right here, ba-babe. Right here.

40:02.965 --> 40:06.586
-  Ah, Phil.
- Oh, my God.

40:06.689 --> 40:08.965
Luis and Michelle...
you are not out of the race.

40:09.068 --> 40:12.172
- Oh.
- You are the tenth team
to arrive.

40:12.275 --> 40:14.758
We're running out of time now.

40:14.862 --> 40:17.034
I've never been under
so much pressure in my life.

40:17.137 --> 40:19.034
We have no idea what...

40:19.137 --> 40:20.689
what place we're in.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.206
We just hope we're not last.

40:22.310 --> 40:24.655
- It might be coming up.
- This says "O-E-T-T" right here,

40:24.758 --> 40:26.000
- but I can't make a left.
- Okay, you make a left.

40:26.103 --> 40:28.586
- It's only a right.
- Oh, my gosh.

40:29.793 --> 40:31.827
- We're almost there, baby.
- Hope so.

40:31.931 --> 40:34.448
Hope I'm not in last.

40:34.551 --> 40:37.344
What a day.

40:37.448 --> 40:40.310
Yeah. Come on.

40:42.275 --> 40:44.931
Aubrey and David, you're nodding
your head like you know.

40:45.034 --> 40:48.413
We figured
the odds are against us.

40:48.517 --> 40:49.448
You knew it was
gonna be competitive

40:49.551 --> 40:50.827
at the starting line, right?

40:50.931 --> 40:52.655
- Oh, right off the bat.
- Right off the bat.

40:52.758 --> 40:54.758
Everybody wants more, I know,
but like I told you,

40:54.862 --> 40:57.172
- no more second chances.
- I know. I know.

40:57.275 --> 40:59.896
- That's...
Yeah, that's the challenge.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.551
Can you see something?

41:02.551 --> 41:04.517
I told you.

41:04.620 --> 41:07.310
- David!
- I told you. I told you.

41:07.413 --> 41:09.034
- Didn't I tell you?
- I am pleased
to tell you

41:09.137 --> 41:10.586
- I told you.
- you are not

41:10.689 --> 41:12.931
- the last team to arrive.
- Aah!
- Yeah!

41:13.034 --> 41:15.068
- You are team number 11.
- Oh!

41:15.172 --> 41:17.586
You are still in the race.

41:18.965 --> 41:20.689
Ah, Aastha and Nina.

41:23.241 --> 41:25.586
Unfortunately, you are
the last team to arrive.

41:25.689 --> 41:27.689
- Yeah.
- And you are eliminated

41:27.793 --> 41:30.482
- from the race.
- That's okay.
We-we had fun. We had fun, Phil.

41:30.586 --> 41:32.275
No regrets. We got to...

41:32.379 --> 41:34.413
I got to go to Germany
with my best friend.

41:34.517 --> 41:37.000
I was so stressed out, but...

41:37.103 --> 41:38.793
I was having a good time, actually.

41:38.896 --> 41:40.689
- She's having such a good time.
- I was having a lot of fun.

41:40.793 --> 41:42.206
And that's how our life
is, you know?

41:42.310 --> 41:46.000
I'm-I'm the person who worries
about every little thing.

41:46.103 --> 41:48.413
And this person
is a light in my life.

41:48.517 --> 41:51.620
And I mean, without her, I-I
wouldn't be in anything, so...

41:51.724 --> 41:55.068
I still have my winner with me,
and, uh, we're gonna go home

41:55.172 --> 41:57.517
and laugh about this
every single day of our lives.

41:57.620 --> 42:00.034
My main rule was to have fun,

42:00.137 --> 42:02.103
<i>and I had a blast today.</i>

42:02.206 --> 42:03.655
There's no other place
in the world that I'd rather be,

42:03.758 --> 42:05.862
<i>and there's no other person
I'd rather be with.</i>

42:19.206 --> 42:20.551
Oh, my gosh.
