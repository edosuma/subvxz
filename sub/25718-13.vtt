00:55.221 --> 00:57.390
Just follow your heart, Mi-rae.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.226
So don't cry, okay?

01:58.910 --> 02:00.620
You don't have to take me home.

02:00.703 --> 02:03.540
Okay, go in now.
Don't come back out again.

02:04.749 --> 02:05.625
Okay.

02:09.044 --> 02:10.255
Goodbye.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.583
You're home.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.750
Yes.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.003
I am going to throw away the trash.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.462
Okay.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.192
Why are you back?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.068
Do you have soju?

03:22.327 --> 03:23.995
Did something happen?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.000
Is it because of her?

03:34.505 --> 03:37.425
Gosh, your first love is giving you
a hard time.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.763
Everyone becomes a fool
for their first love.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.806
You just end up liking a great person...

03:43.890 --> 03:46.559
instead of liking the person
that might like you as well.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.311
How can anyone differentiate that?

03:48.394 --> 03:50.939
It's hard at first, but...

03:51.606 --> 03:55.026
once you get heartbroken a couple of times
you'll start to have better judgment.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.986
You'll be able to stop yourself...

03:57.070 --> 04:00.156
from liking the person that
you don't have a chance with.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.327
You'll continue to stop yourself
from thinking of that person.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.307
Are you sleeping already?

04:29.644 --> 04:30.812
Are you sick?

05:09.976 --> 05:12.937
<i>Good luck with Kyung-seok.</i>

05:18.109 --> 05:21.279
<i>I thought no one would ever root for me.</i>

05:33.207 --> 05:34.959
Hey, I need to go home now.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.296
Let me stay here tonight.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.255
Hey.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.674
Do you think I'm still
the owner of this place?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.014
Fine, do whatever you want.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.516
I'll come early tomorrow morning.

05:55.938 --> 05:56.814
Bye.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.135
Did he leave already?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.478
Did he not come home?

06:44.987 --> 06:46.906
-Hello, Sua.
-Hello.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.283
Let me take a photo of you
wearing a lab coat.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.202
Why only me?

06:52.578 --> 06:54.163
You should take a photo of Dong-won too.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.082
Let me take you first.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.835
Here we go.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.672
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.175
You have good tolerance.
How much did you drink?

07:07.677 --> 07:10.430
I guess everyone reeks of alcohol
if they drink too much.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.056
He's pretty human.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.060
Is there something wrong?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.942
If you're too tired,
you can rest at the nurse's office.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.735
I'll explain to the assistant manager.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.697
Thank you.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.840
You can take a rest here.

07:47.008 --> 07:47.967
Okay.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.781
YEON WOO-YOUNG

08:21.125 --> 08:22.919
Why didn't Tae-hee come today?

08:23.002 --> 08:24.879
I don't know. She won't pick up calls.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.472
Someone should check up on Kyung-seok.

08:34.804 --> 08:36.724
He should at least have some soup.

08:36.807 --> 08:39.894
Just let him rest. He'll sober up soon.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.145
But I'm sure he'll feel sick
until he sobers up.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.857
He should've just stayed home.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.568
If you're that worried,
why don't you go and check up on him?

08:49.570 --> 08:51.113
Do you know where the nurse's office is?

08:52.031 --> 08:53.449
Are you really going to go?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.160
Do you like Kyung-seok?

08:56.994 --> 08:57.828
What?

09:01.749 --> 09:04.293
Gosh, I was just joking.

09:04.961 --> 09:05.795
Are you mad?

09:09.674 --> 09:11.133
No.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.261
It seems like you really like him.

09:19.475 --> 09:20.476
You're right.

09:21.185 --> 09:22.687
I like Kyung-seok.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.777
You said you didn't like him
when I asked at the festival.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.029
I know.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.323
Are you guys dating?

09:35.074 --> 09:37.451
See? I knew this would happen.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.161
They're dating for sure.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.080
No, we're not dating yet.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.602
Are you okay?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.855
Hyun Sua is so weird.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.525
She told us that she doesn't have
high standards. But did you see...

10:09.609 --> 10:11.402
how she confessed
that she likes Do Kyung-seok?

10:11.569 --> 10:13.362
Is she kidding us?

10:14.238 --> 10:16.782
Frankly, it's not like Kyung-seok has
a good personality.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.161
Sua's just the same.
She likes good-looking guys.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.416
Hey.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.502
You already got rejected
at the welcoming party.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.087
Stop making a fuss.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.756
I know that.

10:32.923 --> 10:36.594
But she didn't have to tell me that
she likes someone else.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.642
Yes, I guess.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.519
It's like...

10:47.480 --> 10:49.023
she totally made a fool of me.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.322
<i>About the girl that I like...</i>

10:57.531 --> 10:59.116
<i>Apparently, she likes someone else.</i>

11:00.284 --> 11:02.078
<i>This makes no sense.</i>

11:02.411 --> 11:04.413
<i>She made it seems like</i>
<i>she liked me as well.</i>

11:05.956 --> 11:07.625
<i>Was she just having fun with me?</i>

11:09.293 --> 11:11.087
<i>I'm so mad.</i>

11:16.384 --> 11:17.426
Ms. Na.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.683
What's wrong?

11:23.766 --> 11:26.102
Ms. Yoon just came by

11:26.977 --> 11:29.980
and told me that Kyung-seok
is at the nurse's office right now.

11:31.065 --> 11:31.899
What?

11:32.608 --> 11:34.944
-Is he sick?
-Not exactly.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.904
He's hungover.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.240
I think he drank too much.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.383
Are you okay?

12:05.599 --> 12:08.144
What happened?
Is there something wrong?

12:10.521 --> 12:11.355
No.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.442
Why did you drink so much that

12:14.525 --> 12:16.026
you even have had to come here?

12:18.362 --> 12:19.321
I'm sorry.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.118
Is there really nothing I should be
worried about?

12:26.036 --> 12:27.204
Everything's fine.

12:29.790 --> 12:30.833
How much did you drink?

12:32.042 --> 12:35.212
I'm not too sure.
I think I drank five to six bottles.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.591
No, seven bottles.

12:38.716 --> 12:39.550
What?

12:40.509 --> 12:41.427
Do you want to die?

12:45.181 --> 12:46.015
No,

12:47.224 --> 12:48.809
that was too harsh.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.027
You shouldn't drink that much.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.904
Don't ever do it again.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.791
You really can't smell, can you?

13:13.459 --> 13:16.212
Everyone avoided me today
because I reeked of alcohol.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.174
Don't think your mom is an excuse
for everything.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.510
No one will go easy on you,
even if you're the CEO's son.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.096
If this happens again, I'll kick you out
from the team.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.182
Okay.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.269
Did you treat your hangover?

13:35.189 --> 13:36.023
No.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.193
Gosh, who did you learn
to drink so much like this?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.700
Why are you smiling?
You did nothing good.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.661
It didn't feel real...

13:50.079 --> 13:51.831
but now, I feel like I really have a mom.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.799
Stay here.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.051
I'll go get you some honey water.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.775
Go visit him at the nurse's office.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.569
I might wake him up.

14:21.652 --> 14:22.653
Who cares?

14:22.736 --> 14:24.280
It could be irritating.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.407
No one will be irritated
if you visit him.

14:26.490 --> 14:29.577
Just go in there, and ask him
if he's okay.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.453
Then he'll say "Sua, you're here."

14:31.537 --> 14:34.081
That's how you'll start dating him.

14:34.790 --> 14:35.708
Go now.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.084
<i>What's going on?</i>

14:37.418 --> 14:39.336
<i>She only said she has a crush on him</i>

14:40.045 --> 14:42.381
<i>but if feels like they're already</i>
<i>become an official couple.</i>

14:42.923 --> 14:44.508
I'd go if I were you.

14:45.676 --> 14:46.594
You really should.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.470
It's hard to understand.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.306
What?

14:51.223 --> 14:52.224
Nothing.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.648
WOO-YOUNG

15:02.860 --> 15:03.903
Hello?

15:04.236 --> 15:05.404
We should go too.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.447
Shall we?

15:11.702 --> 15:12.620
Hey, Tae-hee.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.831
What's wrong? What happened?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.544
What's wrong?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.672
I broke up with my boyfriend.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.008
What?

15:27.885 --> 15:29.011
Stop crying for now.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.389
Stop crying.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.812
Don't cry.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.440
Yes.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.484
Kyung-seok is here.
Why do you ask?

15:43.567 --> 15:46.320
He wasn't home in the morning,
so I was wondering if he never came home.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.364
He didn't go home yesterday?

15:49.531 --> 15:51.825
No, I'm relieved to hear that he's there.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.745
You're okay, right?

15:59.124 --> 15:59.959
Yes.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.046
I'll hang up then.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.506
Bye.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.266
I'm not okay.

16:22.856 --> 16:25.067
All of a sudden over the phone?

16:25.943 --> 16:26.902
Why?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.196
We had an argument because of Chan-woo.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.365
But that can't be the reason to break up.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.034
Maybe he has other reasons.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.871
Did he feel ashamed to date
a fat girlfriend too?

16:37.955 --> 16:39.999
Hey, what are you saying?

16:40.499 --> 16:43.460
I can't believe that's the only reason.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.047
Did her boyfriend dump her?

16:48.090 --> 16:49.591
That's why she cried.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.721
People say it's fine as long as
you love each other

16:53.887 --> 16:55.681
but I guess you can't ignore
what others say.

16:55.764 --> 16:59.268
Yes, a lot of them said
Tae-young was too good...

16:59.351 --> 17:00.894
for the chubby girl like her.

17:01.228 --> 17:04.772
I don't know why people gossip
about other people's love affairs.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.733
Goodness.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.987
Right?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.265
-Go in.
-Okay.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.893
Cheer up, Tae-young.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.145
Remember I'm always on your side.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.086
You always brush your teeth
right after eating.

18:07.169 --> 18:10.130
It became a habit.
I feel uncomfortable if I don't do it.

18:10.798 --> 18:11.965
I'll be back.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.686
Did you hear?

18:27.606 --> 18:29.691
Tae-young and Tae-hee broke up.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.776
What?

18:30.901 --> 18:32.861
Everyone talked about how
she didn't deserve him.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.030
It must've been stressful.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.534
I'm worried too.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.954
People might say I don't deserve
Kyung-seok if we go out.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.961
<i>Kyung-seok doesn't like you.</i>

18:50.379 --> 18:52.589
Some men think this way.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.843
They date girls because they like them

18:56.385 --> 18:58.178
but they also want to show them off.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.684
-Excuse me.
-Thanks for that day.

19:03.767 --> 19:07.563
Things were awkward between
me and Kyung-seok

19:07.646 --> 19:09.773
but you walked away as if
you didn't see us.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.663
<i>Hyun Sua.</i>

19:25.289 --> 19:26.790
<i>You know about everything.</i>

19:28.000 --> 19:29.835
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

20:16.632 --> 20:18.133
Since when were you there?

20:18.884 --> 20:19.843
Did you...

20:21.136 --> 20:22.262
throw up?

20:22.888 --> 20:23.722
What?

20:23.805 --> 20:26.141
It sounded like you did throw up.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.145
I felt sick.

20:30.812 --> 20:33.106
I gagged a little, but didn't throw up.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.410
What is it?

20:45.494 --> 20:47.788
I saw you earlier during lunch

20:48.247 --> 20:50.791
but you didn't look like
you were feeling sick.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.335
What?

20:56.588 --> 20:57.881
By any chance...

20:59.883 --> 21:02.844
do you habitually throw up
after eating?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.558
That's ridiculous.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.394
Why would I do that?

21:10.811 --> 21:13.272
Do you see me as a person
who'd do such a thing?

21:21.947 --> 21:22.906
<i>She's flustered.</i>

21:23.824 --> 21:25.951
<i>It's obvious she's flustered.</i>

21:29.538 --> 21:30.414
You woke up?

21:31.456 --> 21:34.584
I was told to come
and check your condition.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.132
How many bottles does a heavy drinker
like you need to drink

21:40.215 --> 21:41.883
to become that drunk?

21:47.139 --> 21:49.308
Do I still reek of alcohol?

21:50.809 --> 21:52.561
You do.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.939
Still, it's better than a while ago.

22:00.527 --> 22:01.361
What's that?

22:02.904 --> 22:05.490
Is that honey water?
Who made you that?

22:07.576 --> 22:08.952
Did Sua come see you?

22:09.536 --> 22:10.704
Why would she come here?

22:13.623 --> 22:16.084
We had a crazy incident
during lunch earlier.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.587
We were having lunch together and...

22:20.255 --> 22:21.757
Sua confessed that she likes you.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.259
What?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.345
Kyung-seok, you're unbelievable

22:26.762 --> 22:28.722
for getting a girl like her
to have a crush on you.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.807
I'm so jealous.

22:34.728 --> 22:35.854
You had no clue at all?

22:37.731 --> 22:38.899
Is she out of her mind?

22:40.984 --> 22:42.152
Gosh, hey.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.447
Hey Kyung-seok. Do Kyung-seok!

22:56.666 --> 22:59.002
<i>I've done it too, even though it was</i>
<i>only for a short while.</i>

23:03.006 --> 23:06.176
I've always been too skinny
and I didn't like it.

23:07.302 --> 23:11.223
<i>Why? Why did she lie</i>
<i>that she never gains weight?</i>

23:12.224 --> 23:14.017
<i>That pretty friend of yours</i>

23:14.101 --> 23:17.229
<i>may not be much different from you.</i>

23:19.648 --> 23:21.525
<i>Even with that pretty face</i>

23:22.526 --> 23:24.236
<i>you're unhappy?</i>

23:27.114 --> 23:28.365
Hey, Kyung-seok.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.745
Kyung-seok, Do Kyung-seok.

23:34.704 --> 23:35.956
Are you feeling better now?

23:39.751 --> 23:41.128
We need to talk later.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.588
Oh, okay. I'll see you in a bit.

24:20.792 --> 24:21.960
Tae-young, where are you?

24:23.879 --> 24:26.882
-Do you want to grab a drink later?
-<i>A drink, not food?</i>

24:27.883 --> 24:28.717
Yes.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.887
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>
<i>You rarely drink.</i>

24:34.306 --> 24:35.474
I know, right?

24:36.016 --> 24:38.185
I'm surprised that I'm craving alcohol.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.438
Alright, bring other guys too.
I'll treat you all.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.358
Okay, I'll see you there.

24:54.242 --> 24:57.329
Those who aren't here today and
those who are late,

24:57.996 --> 25:01.750
if you're late again or miss another class
you won't get your certificate.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.548
Where shall we go to talk?

25:08.632 --> 25:11.051
We don't need to go anywhere.
Let's talk here.

25:12.636 --> 25:13.553
Here?

25:19.768 --> 25:22.354
Guys, shall we leave? Let's go.

25:23.104 --> 25:24.439
Come on, let's go.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.790
Kyung-seok is so manly.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.918
Still, he should take her somewhere
romantic.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.421
Manly? I don't think so.
He seemed mad.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.882
No way. What's there to be mad about?

25:50.966 --> 25:52.467
I mean, Sua likes him.

25:53.468 --> 25:55.595
I'm telling you.
They'll start dating today.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.810
I told you to stop.

26:02.352 --> 26:03.186
Stop what?

26:03.270 --> 26:05.272
I heard you told everyone that
you like me.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.233
You're really something.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.486
I've never hated anyone this much.

26:11.903 --> 26:14.322
Why are you so cold to me?

26:14.948 --> 26:16.491
Just because you don't like me

26:16.575 --> 26:19.244
doesn't mean you should doubt me
when I say I like you.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.291
I pity you.

26:27.085 --> 26:27.919
Alright.

26:28.628 --> 26:31.006
I never knew having a crush on someone
was this hard.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.924
This is really exhausting.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.052
That's not the point.

26:38.221 --> 26:39.848
I pity you as a person.

26:41.933 --> 26:42.934
What?

26:43.518 --> 26:45.020
If I date someone else

26:45.687 --> 26:48.607
does that ruin your reputation
of being the most popular girl?

26:58.575 --> 27:00.410
<i>Kyung-seok will reject her.</i>

27:01.119 --> 27:03.163
<i>But it'll distance me</i>
<i>further away from him.</i>

27:04.497 --> 27:08.084
<i>Everyone will think that he'll date</i>
<i>someone who's prettier than Sua.</i>

27:08.209 --> 27:10.003
<i>They'll have high expectation.</i>

27:11.379 --> 27:13.757
<i>Sua can't date Kyung-seok.</i>

27:14.674 --> 27:16.885
<i>and he doesn't like her.</i>

27:17.969 --> 27:19.804
<i>I'm sure she knows too.</i>

27:21.181 --> 27:23.516
<i>Then why did she tell everyone</i>
<i>that she has a crush on him?</i>

27:24.351 --> 27:26.645
Some men think this way.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.439
They date girls because they like them

27:30.023 --> 27:31.775
but they also want to show them off.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.702
<i>Sua doesn't like Kyung-seok.</i>

27:46.206 --> 27:48.917
Then just like how you told everyone
about having a crush on me,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.878
shall I go ahead and tell everyone
who I really like?

27:54.172 --> 27:56.216
Shall I tell everyone that
I like Kang Mi-rae?

27:57.467 --> 27:58.510
Well, if you do that,

28:00.178 --> 28:01.846
Mi-rae will become very famous.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.644
People will wonder why a guy like you has
fallen for Mi-rae.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.356
Do you think all that gossiping and rumors
will help her?

28:23.284 --> 28:24.327
Mi-rae.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.292
Kyung-seok, let's go.

28:38.174 --> 28:42.387
Well, we're talking about something
important right now.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.140
I have to talk to him about something
important too.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.809
What do you think you're doing?

28:48.226 --> 28:49.102
Hyun Sua.

28:50.270 --> 28:53.398
-What do you think you're doing now?
-I'll talk to her.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.361
Let me talk to Sua for a minute.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.468
I know that you don't like me.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.720
I also know you can't stand the fact

29:24.179 --> 29:25.805
that Kyung-seok likes me.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.224
But...

29:28.975 --> 29:30.518
you'd better not use him.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.440
Do not meddle in his life.

29:36.399 --> 29:38.443
I'm meddling in his life?

29:40.153 --> 29:41.237
What do you mean?

29:41.321 --> 29:44.073
Everyone knows that he's the most
handsome and competent guy.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.619
If he dates someone else,
you won't be in the spotlight anymore.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.622
That's why you're trying to make sure

29:50.705 --> 29:53.708
he can't date anyone if he's not going
to go out with you.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.214
Are you thinking straight?

29:59.798 --> 30:00.632
Yes.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.468
I've come to my senses.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.680
I can see exactly what
you're trying to do.

30:08.264 --> 30:10.016
Even with Chan-woo

30:10.099 --> 30:13.269
I bet you told him you can't date him
because I like him.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.315
I also know that you approached
Park Young-chul first.

30:17.398 --> 30:20.568
You must've wanted to make me admit
that I was born ugly.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.112
That I'm no match for you.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.454
That's right.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.541
From the moment I was born,

30:35.875 --> 30:38.378
and for the rest of my life,
I'll be different from you.

30:39.337 --> 30:42.799
I'm different from girls who want
to fix their faces for a better life.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.012
I'm not sure about that.

30:50.098 --> 30:53.893
I think we're a bit similar in some ways.

30:54.978 --> 30:55.854
What?

30:57.730 --> 31:00.650
Are you saying that
because of what you saw?

31:01.985 --> 31:05.029
Let me make myself clear again.
I wasn't forcing myself to throw up.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.657
I was just nauseous, that's all.

31:09.617 --> 31:12.537
The fact that you're bringing this up now

31:15.707 --> 31:18.543
tells me that you were in fact
forcing yourself to throw up.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.170
Hey!

31:30.054 --> 31:31.764
I've never seen you like this before.

31:35.351 --> 31:36.227
Do you know

31:37.896 --> 31:40.440
that this is your first time being
honest with me?

31:42.025 --> 31:46.529
I think this is my first time
seeing the real you.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.044
That brat.

32:03.463 --> 32:04.881
She should know her place.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.611
What is it?

32:29.989 --> 32:32.033
-What do you mean?
-You said you wanted to talk to me.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.328
What was it?

32:37.205 --> 32:39.666
Well, the thing is...

32:43.711 --> 32:44.921
Are you sober now?

32:49.050 --> 32:50.259
I'm so disappointed.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.805
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

32:54.764 --> 32:55.598
Yes.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.480
I was worried about you.

33:14.283 --> 33:15.243
Do you want to eat?

33:16.327 --> 33:17.370
What?

33:31.592 --> 33:34.220
GANGNAM BEAUTY

33:45.898 --> 33:46.858
You're home early.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.819
I'm going to rest for a while.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.780
I don't feel like dealing with customers.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.824
-Did you eat?
-No.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.785
I bought you some dumplings.
You should have some.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.538
I don't feel like eating anything.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.792
Gosh, stop acting as if someone died.
What's wrong?

34:08.420 --> 34:09.880
It's all my fault.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.592
I told her to get a full makeover.

34:14.092 --> 34:16.344
She should've just gotten
a few surgeries done.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.097
What's the point of saying that now?

34:18.848 --> 34:19.891
Here, let's eat.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.812
By any chance

34:25.353 --> 34:28.274
did people say that in front of her?

34:29.984 --> 34:32.235
They're probably just saying that
behind her back, right?

34:36.991 --> 34:40.328
I feel so sorry for her.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.705
Gosh, I told you to stop acting
as if someone died.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.081
Why are you crying?

34:45.416 --> 34:47.460
I feel sorry toward you too.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.630
There are a lot of people
who like Mi-rae as well.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.674
She seemed really popular
at the orientation.

34:54.257 --> 34:57.428
Right? There have to be more people
that like her, right?

34:57.512 --> 35:01.015
Of course, people who call her names
are the ones who don't know her well.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.893
The ones who know her well
wouldn't call her that.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.188
-Eat.
-Yes.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.107
You're right.

35:16.739 --> 35:18.741
Were you really going to ask
if I was sober or not?

35:20.618 --> 35:21.452
What?

35:23.287 --> 35:24.413
Well, that and...

35:26.415 --> 35:28.000
Why didn't you go home last night?

35:30.294 --> 35:31.295
How did you know?

35:31.379 --> 35:33.422
Woo-young called me earlier.

35:33.506 --> 35:36.384
He said you didn't come home
and asked if you came to the lab.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.719
I didn't go home
because I didn't want to see his face.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.138
Why?

35:43.516 --> 35:45.518
Did you fight with him?

35:46.644 --> 35:48.896
I would've fought with him
if it was worth fighting for.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.108
If it wasn't worth fighting, then why
don't you want to see his face?

35:57.405 --> 36:00.658
That's weird. He's a nice guy.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.123
Okay, fine.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.417
-I don't want it.
-Okay, fine.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.045
Woo-young, is something wrong?

36:15.506 --> 36:16.757
No, there's nothing wrong.

36:16.841 --> 36:20.553
You've bought us food a lot of times,
but this is the first buying us drinks.

36:23.222 --> 36:26.267
This is so fun. Let's drink.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.268
Come on, cheers.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.115
Are you guys dating anyone?

36:41.199 --> 36:45.661
He's dating Tae-hee
and we're not dating anyone, as usual.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.208
Did I ask you to come out
when you have to meet Tae-hee?

36:50.291 --> 36:53.127
No, we don't meet that often.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.962
How come? You just started dating.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.590
Don't couples usually meet each other
everyday at first?

36:57.673 --> 36:59.926
Then why do you always get dumped so fast?

37:00.009 --> 37:01.761
Hey, I've dumped someone as well.

37:01.844 --> 37:03.554
When? I don't ever recall it.

37:03.638 --> 37:06.766
-Gosh, you don't know me.
-Then tell me, when did you dump someone?

37:06.849 --> 37:08.184
Tell me, who did you dump?

37:09.018 --> 37:11.020
-Min-jung.
-Oh, come on.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.106
Who's Min-jung?

37:14.190 --> 37:16.901
The pretty girl in the biology department.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.946
That's absurd. Why did you dump her?

37:20.029 --> 37:21.072
Well...

37:21.572 --> 37:24.492
she's pretty but she's not very curvy.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.202
-Gosh.
-He's lying.

37:26.285 --> 37:27.620
I'm not lying.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.373
-Do you want me to call Min-jung?
-Yes.

37:30.498 --> 37:33.167
-I'll call her.
-Where's my phone?

37:34.085 --> 37:35.086
Why did you...

37:36.420 --> 37:38.547
suddenly show up when
I was talking to Hyun Sua?

37:39.048 --> 37:39.882
What?

37:40.466 --> 37:43.427
You could've asked if I was sober
after I was done talking to her.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.305
You're right.

37:47.014 --> 37:49.016
I guess I'm impatient.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.269
Was it because...

37:53.229 --> 37:56.107
you were worried that something might
happen between me and Sua?

37:57.566 --> 37:58.651
No.

37:59.902 --> 38:02.989
I already know that you don't like Sua.

38:09.578 --> 38:10.496
Are you done eating?

38:11.122 --> 38:11.956
Yes.

38:18.421 --> 38:22.258
<i>Frankly, I went there because</i>
<i>I didn't want anyone bothering you.</i>

38:23.009 --> 38:25.678
<i>I didn't want her to anger</i>
<i>the guy I like.</i>

38:25.803 --> 38:26.637
Aren't you coming?

38:28.055 --> 38:29.598
Okay, I'm going.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.129
<i>I've never seen you like this before.</i>

39:00.755 --> 39:03.424
I think this is my first time...

39:05.801 --> 39:07.261
seeing the real you.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.970
<i>I've tried so hard.</i>

40:19.917 --> 40:21.919
-Hello?
<i>-Hey, Sua.</i>

40:22.628 --> 40:24.130
<i>It's me, Tae-young.</i>

40:27.508 --> 40:28.384
<i>Hello?</i>

40:31.470 --> 40:32.638
Yes.

40:34.390 --> 40:38.227
<i>I had a couple of drinks.</i>

40:39.145 --> 40:40.563
I'm busy right now.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.191
<i>Sua.</i>

41:05.212 --> 41:06.547
My gosh.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.674
-Let's put him over there.
-Okay.

41:08.883 --> 41:09.925
My goodness.

41:15.347 --> 41:18.350
You're the guy he lives with?

41:18.601 --> 41:20.769
-Let's go, I'm about to pass out.
-Okay.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.230
Please take care of him.

41:24.690 --> 41:27.693
He's acting strange today.
I'm sure something's up.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.328
Woo-young.

41:39.705 --> 41:40.956
Wake up.

41:42.291 --> 41:45.002
-It's you, Kyung-seok.
-Sleep in your bed.

41:45.085 --> 41:47.046
Okay, I will.

41:47.129 --> 41:48.964
I won't sleep outside.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.967
-You're home.
-Okay, I'll go.

41:56.722 --> 41:57.848
Sit up first.

42:00.726 --> 42:01.644
Gosh, why.

42:03.896 --> 42:05.731
It's you, Kyung-seok.

42:07.816 --> 42:10.236
I need to brush my teeth
before going to bed.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.580
Gosh, easy, easy.

42:34.802 --> 42:35.636
Here you go.

42:36.845 --> 42:37.680
Thanks.

42:50.109 --> 42:50.943
Thank you.

43:02.496 --> 43:03.831
Gosh, I almost threw up.

43:04.498 --> 43:06.250
It's driving me nuts.

43:07.668 --> 43:09.795
-This tastes weird.
-Give me that.

43:18.178 --> 43:19.013
Open your mouth.

43:21.140 --> 43:22.516
It's all over his face.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.480
This is it.

43:28.564 --> 43:30.899
Please brush the other side too.

43:32.610 --> 43:33.861
There, right there.

43:33.944 --> 43:34.945
Open your mouth wider.

43:39.658 --> 43:41.201
I can't believe I'm doing this.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.417
Thank you.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.597
It's tougher than I thought.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.599
Why did you drink more than
you can handle?

44:07.144 --> 44:09.188
I got rejected by Mi-rae.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.071
What did you just say?

44:20.074 --> 44:20.908
Woo-young.

44:22.284 --> 44:23.994
Woo-young, Woo-young.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.080
Woo-young, Woo-young.

44:39.134 --> 44:40.010
Mi-rae.

44:40.719 --> 44:41.553
Yes?

44:42.096 --> 44:44.098
Aren't we going to go on blind dates?

44:45.557 --> 44:46.684
Why suddenly?

44:46.767 --> 44:50.437
I thought I'd have a handsome boyfriend
when I enter college.

44:50.521 --> 44:51.689
But nothing is happening.

44:53.982 --> 44:55.567
DO KYUNG-SEOK

45:06.286 --> 45:07.371
Hello?

45:07.454 --> 45:08.831
Come out for a second.

45:09.540 --> 45:10.499
Right now?

45:11.542 --> 45:12.501
Yes.

45:13.043 --> 45:15.129
It's not something I could
talk about tomorrow.

45:16.463 --> 45:17.631
Anyway, come out now.

45:18.674 --> 45:19.508
Okay.

46:09.975 --> 46:10.809
Well...

46:12.019 --> 46:14.104
go ahead and ask me.

46:16.482 --> 46:18.734
What did you do with Woo-young yesterday?

46:22.613 --> 46:24.531
Why do I have to tell you that?

46:28.702 --> 46:30.287
I heard you rejected him.

46:31.914 --> 46:32.831
Is that true?

46:32.915 --> 46:34.875
Who told you that?
Did Woo-young say that?

46:36.168 --> 46:37.169
Yes.

46:37.586 --> 46:38.629
Wow.

46:39.505 --> 46:41.757
I didn't think he'd be
that kind of a person.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.050
He has such a big mouth.

46:50.933 --> 46:51.767
Anyway...

46:52.559 --> 46:54.686
did you call me out to ask me that?

47:02.277 --> 47:03.445
Yes.

47:14.206 --> 47:15.040
Shall we go?

47:26.218 --> 47:27.052
Aren't you going?

47:28.804 --> 47:30.722
I'll tell you why I turned him down.

47:34.935 --> 47:37.521
I have someone I like.

47:42.150 --> 47:43.026
Because I...

47:47.114 --> 47:48.699
like you.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.626
I like you.

48:35.954 --> 48:37.748
I know I'm shameless

48:39.458 --> 48:43.086
to say this after rejecting you twice.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.172
That's okay.

48:49.384 --> 48:51.053
I told you I'd wait.

49:10.906 --> 49:12.908
So now, we're...

49:12.991 --> 49:14.159
We're going out, right?

49:14.826 --> 49:16.495
-What?
-No?

49:17.788 --> 49:20.374
Yes, we are.

49:37.557 --> 49:38.809
Shall we go now?

50:11.258 --> 50:14.636
It's pretty much the same, right?

50:18.432 --> 50:19.725
Should we hold hands?

50:25.272 --> 50:26.106
Well...

50:27.524 --> 50:28.817
we could.

51:00.932 --> 51:01.808
We're here already.

51:04.936 --> 51:05.812
I know.

51:10.942 --> 51:12.652
I should let go of your hand now.

51:28.585 --> 51:30.629
Thanks, get home safely.

51:31.546 --> 51:33.298
Alright, go in.

51:34.257 --> 51:35.092
Okay.

51:40.514 --> 51:41.681
Bye. Go home safely.

52:08.333 --> 52:10.544
-You're back.
-Yes.

52:10.627 --> 52:13.171
Why did he want to see you?
Was it something urgent?

52:13.255 --> 52:15.257
No, nothing urgent.

52:17.717 --> 52:18.593
Hey, do you...

52:21.096 --> 52:22.389
still like Do Kyung-seok?

52:23.056 --> 52:23.890
What?

52:24.474 --> 52:27.894
I mean, feelings can change.

52:29.104 --> 52:31.731
You may like someone else, you know?

52:33.650 --> 52:35.819
Someone else? What are you talking about?

52:36.194 --> 52:37.362
No.

52:44.995 --> 52:48.415
Both you and I need to like guys
who will like us back.

54:00.862 --> 54:02.739
Did something happen yesterday?

54:04.282 --> 54:06.409
You drank a lot yesterday.
Have some of this.

54:11.748 --> 54:13.959
Make sure to take this before you drink.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.878
Hey, what's wrong with you?

54:16.962 --> 54:17.963
Why?

54:28.265 --> 54:29.349
I must've made a mistake.

54:30.100 --> 54:33.353
Are you being all nice to me
because you're going to move out?

54:33.436 --> 54:35.188
Why would I move out?

54:43.530 --> 54:45.448
-Did you cook this?
-Yes.

54:45.532 --> 54:48.827
-You're a pretty good cook.
-You can find all sorts of recipes online.

54:49.661 --> 54:50.537
That's right.

54:53.123 --> 54:54.582
I did make a mistake, right?

54:54.666 --> 54:56.126
You did.

54:57.919 --> 55:00.880
By any chance, did I cry? No, right?

55:02.257 --> 55:04.759
I think you did tear up a bit.

55:07.053 --> 55:08.221
Did I actually cry?

55:08.305 --> 55:10.807
If you jab the back of your throat
with a toothbrush like this,

55:10.890 --> 55:12.642
you could tear up.

55:15.437 --> 55:17.605
I'm glad I brushed my teeth
before going to bed.

55:30.702 --> 55:33.288
I told Mi-rae that I like her,
but she rejected me.

55:33.788 --> 55:37.792
I thought she'd at least think about it,
but she rejected me right away.

55:42.005 --> 55:43.840
I know you like Mi-rae too.

55:44.632 --> 55:45.467
Good luck.

55:49.679 --> 55:50.555
I'm trying.

55:51.639 --> 55:53.641
You'll have to make a lot of effort.

55:54.809 --> 56:00.315
Mi-rae is quite reserved and cautious,
so it won't be as easy.

56:03.234 --> 56:05.153
Don't tell her about me getting all drunk.

56:05.528 --> 56:06.613
She'll feel bad.

56:09.991 --> 56:11.242
Did you like her a lot?

56:15.163 --> 56:17.749
I think I did. More than I realized.

56:35.392 --> 56:36.726
<i>Am I dreaming?</i>

56:43.024 --> 56:44.317
DO KYUNG-SEOK

56:44.401 --> 56:45.652
<i>Are you awake?</i>

56:46.319 --> 56:48.613
<i>No, this isn't a dream.</i>

56:52.075 --> 56:55.954
YES

56:59.082 --> 57:00.417
<i>Let's go to the lab together.</i>

57:04.003 --> 57:06.005
-What are you doing?
-What?

57:06.464 --> 57:08.341
Did you hear some bad news?

57:08.925 --> 57:09.843
No.

57:13.930 --> 57:15.181
I have to get ready.

57:29.028 --> 57:30.029
What's wrong with her?

57:33.575 --> 57:36.494
I should have done a facial mask
last night.

57:38.955 --> 57:41.499
Why is my face so puffy today?

58:30.131 --> 58:32.175
-Hi.
-Hi.

58:33.301 --> 58:35.887
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes, what about you?

58:36.846 --> 58:37.764
I did too.

58:40.725 --> 58:43.269
This sounds like a conversation
in an English textbook.

58:43.353 --> 58:44.270
What do you mean?

58:45.813 --> 58:48.399
Good morning, how are you?
I'm fine. And you?

58:53.488 --> 58:54.447
Oh, the bus is here.

59:04.123 --> 59:04.958
Go ahead.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.211
Okay.

59:18.304 --> 59:20.974
Did you have breakfast?

59:21.891 --> 59:24.561
No, I just had a glass of water.

59:25.853 --> 59:27.272
Do you usually skip breakfast?

59:28.982 --> 59:31.901
I eat breakfast sometimes.

59:32.902 --> 59:33.778
What about you?

59:34.571 --> 59:37.407
I had breakfast with Woo-young.

59:41.619 --> 59:42.579
Did you tell him?

59:42.662 --> 59:43.830
Tell him about what?

59:43.913 --> 59:47.542
Did you tell Woo-young that we're dating?

59:49.627 --> 59:50.587
No, not yet.

59:51.879 --> 59:52.714
I see.

59:54.716 --> 59:55.633
Should I tell him?

59:56.801 --> 59:57.719
No.

59:58.553 --> 1:00:00.888
If he finds out I started dating you
right away...

1:00:02.181 --> 1:00:03.016
Do you feel bad?

1:00:04.350 --> 1:00:05.643
Yes, a little bit.

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:09.731
I guess...

1:00:11.149 --> 1:00:13.943
-you're worried about Woo-young.
-No, I'm not.

1:00:15.403 --> 1:00:18.573
It's just that he was the first person
who rooted for us.

1:00:19.365 --> 1:00:21.492
Who? Woo-young?

1:00:22.243 --> 1:00:23.077
Yes.

1:00:23.870 --> 1:00:25.371
He wished me good luck with you.

1:00:28.583 --> 1:00:31.294
I guess I made it pretty obvious
that I like you.

1:00:33.838 --> 1:00:36.424
-He deserved to get his teeth brushed.
-What?

1:00:37.383 --> 1:00:38.217
Nothing.

1:00:42.513 --> 1:00:43.389
By the way...

1:00:46.809 --> 1:00:49.187
I'd prefer not to tell people.

1:00:49.937 --> 1:00:50.772
Why?

1:00:52.023 --> 1:00:55.318
-Are you worried they might say something?
-Yes.

1:00:56.444 --> 1:00:57.570
I must sound so dumb.

1:01:01.199 --> 1:01:03.242
If anyone says anything,
I won't let it go.

1:01:06.412 --> 1:01:09.207
Do whatever you want.
It doesn't matter to me.

1:01:20.968 --> 1:01:22.345
But no one on this bus knows.

1:01:23.137 --> 1:01:23.971
What?

1:01:36.651 --> 1:01:39.904
-Forget it if you don't want to.
-No, I want to.

1:02:09.267 --> 1:02:11.102
Let's stay like this until we get off.

1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:13.855
Okay.

1:02:28.411 --> 1:02:29.746
Are they coming together?

1:02:30.705 --> 1:02:33.249
-You mean Kyung-seok and Sua?
-Yes.

1:02:33.332 --> 1:02:35.835
But Kyung-seok seemed
pretty upset yesterday.

1:02:35.918 --> 1:02:37.044
He seemed a bit mad.

1:02:37.128 --> 1:02:38.963
Haven't you watched
any romantic comedies?

1:02:39.046 --> 1:02:40.590
Bickering can make
the heart grow fonder.

1:02:40.673 --> 1:02:43.760
That's true. I wonder why we're still
not fond of each other.

1:02:43.843 --> 1:02:45.052
What happened yesterday?

1:02:45.678 --> 1:02:47.346
-With what?
-With Kyung-seok.

1:02:52.393 --> 1:02:54.061
I think he likes someone else.

1:02:54.145 --> 1:02:55.021
What?

1:03:00.651 --> 1:03:02.195
Hey, where are you?

1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:05.865
-I'm almost there.
-I have big news for you.

1:03:05.948 --> 1:03:06.949
What is it?

1:03:07.033 --> 1:03:09.994
He rejected Sua.

1:03:12.288 --> 1:03:13.414
She deserves it.

1:03:13.998 --> 1:03:15.666
Apparently, Kyung-seok likes
someone else.

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:17.752
Gosh, who could it be?

1:03:18.753 --> 1:03:21.506
She must be prettier than Sua,
so it can't be someone from our school.

1:03:21.589 --> 1:03:23.382
-Hey.
-What?

1:03:23.466 --> 1:03:25.301
Sua isn't that pretty.

1:03:28.179 --> 1:03:29.972
My goodness.

1:03:30.848 --> 1:03:33.059
You should've given up like that
a long time ago.

1:03:35.144 --> 1:03:36.270
Who could it be?

1:03:39.023 --> 1:03:40.983
Are you not going to tell Hyung-jung too?

1:03:41.609 --> 1:03:44.821
No, I should tell her.

1:03:50.409 --> 1:03:52.662
You should go in first.
I'll go in a bit later.

1:03:53.246 --> 1:03:55.581
No, I'll go in later.
You go ahead.

1:03:55.665 --> 1:03:56.707
No, you go in first.

1:03:56.791 --> 1:03:59.544
No, you go ahead. I'm really okay.

1:04:00.086 --> 1:04:01.212
What are you guys doing?

1:04:03.548 --> 1:04:04.382
Hey, Unnie.

1:04:05.466 --> 1:04:07.343
Why are you guys not going in?

1:04:08.719 --> 1:04:11.472
-We just ran into each other here.
-What?

1:04:15.768 --> 1:04:17.895
<i>That didn't even make sense.</i>

1:04:21.315 --> 1:04:22.692
I'll head in first.

1:04:28.406 --> 1:04:32.076
Did Kyung-seok tell you what happened
with Sua yesterday?

1:04:32.535 --> 1:04:33.369
Pardon?

1:04:34.453 --> 1:04:37.832
I don't think it went well.

1:04:37.915 --> 1:04:39.959
I knew it.

1:04:40.877 --> 1:04:41.711
How?

1:04:41.794 --> 1:04:44.463
I think he has feelings for you.

1:04:44.922 --> 1:04:45.756
What?

1:04:47.216 --> 1:04:50.261
What on earth are you talking about?

1:04:52.513 --> 1:04:55.141
You said Jung-boon is taking
a summer class, right?

1:04:55.349 --> 1:04:58.060
Yes, let's visit her school soon.

1:05:00.146 --> 1:05:01.647
I miss Jung-Boon.

1:05:03.774 --> 1:05:05.026
I feel bad for Sua.

1:05:05.484 --> 1:05:07.320
She should've just kept it to herself.

1:05:08.446 --> 1:05:11.449
Hey, why didn't you feel bad for me?

1:05:12.450 --> 1:05:15.328
Everyone knew I had a crush on Kyung-seok.
I was so embarrassed.

1:05:15.870 --> 1:05:18.414
That's because you were hitting on him.

1:05:19.373 --> 1:05:20.207
What?

1:05:23.794 --> 1:05:24.879
Hey, Tae-hee.

1:05:34.472 --> 1:05:35.348
Do Kyung-seok.

1:05:51.113 --> 1:05:53.532
Shouldn't we finish our conversation
from yesterday?

1:05:55.201 --> 1:05:56.827
I told you everything I had to say.

1:05:59.413 --> 1:06:02.667
I've told everyone that you rejected me.

1:06:06.629 --> 1:06:07.546
-Unnie.
-Yes?

1:06:09.966 --> 1:06:12.009
I have to use the restroom real quick.

1:06:12.468 --> 1:06:13.302
Okay.

1:06:20.393 --> 1:06:21.811
I won't be like that again.

1:06:22.853 --> 1:06:24.438
I'm sorry if I bothered you.

1:06:27.108 --> 1:06:29.527
We'll have to see each other
at school.

1:06:30.569 --> 1:06:33.155
We'll both be uncomfortable
if we're on bad terms.

1:06:33.406 --> 1:06:36.325
-Let's at least say hi to each other.
<i>-</i>Depends on how you behave.

1:06:39.996 --> 1:06:41.205
You're so cold to me.

1:06:43.708 --> 1:06:45.376
So are you dating Mi-rae?

1:06:50.006 --> 1:06:50.965
Are you guys dating?

1:06:53.384 --> 1:06:54.218
Yes.

1:07:01.017 --> 1:07:01.934
We are dating.

1:07:26.876 --> 1:07:29.628
<i>-You've gotten so brave, Mi-rae.</i>
-How dare you.

1:07:29.712 --> 1:07:31.047
<i>I feel like I'm in a spy movie.</i>

1:07:31.130 --> 1:07:33.841
We won't run into people
from our department, right?

1:07:33.924 --> 1:07:36.260
It looked like Tae-young was confessing.

1:07:36.343 --> 1:07:38.929
Is there something you wanted to tell me?

1:07:39.013 --> 1:07:40.389
Hey, isn't this Sua?

1:07:40.473 --> 1:07:41.307
What is this?

1:07:41.390 --> 1:07:43.601
I happened to see it while I was
surfing the web.

1:07:43.684 --> 1:07:46.687
<i>-Who took the photos?</i>
<i>-Hide it from people in your department?</i>

1:07:46.771 --> 1:07:50.232
<i>-Who is he seeing after rejecting Sua?</i>
-If people find out that it's me...

1:07:50.316 --> 1:07:51.567
<i>Don't feel bad for me.</i>

1:07:51.650 --> 1:07:53.110
<i>That's what Sua wants.</i>
