STEFAN: Previously on
The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.760 --> 00:04.807
LILY: You have a mother?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.081
I had a mom. She died.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.810
We loved her. She was our world.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.604
Our mother faked her death,

00:09.800 --> 00:10.961
left her sons behind,

00:11.160 --> 00:13.128
started a new family
and went out of her way

00:13.360 --> 00:14.600
to forget us forever.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.002
Who do you think gave Kai
the idea to put Elena

00:17.280 --> 00:18.520
in that sleeping beauty coma?

00:18.760 --> 00:19.807
- Wh0?
-\/ALARIEI Lily.

00:20.040 --> 00:21.610
You chose your heretics
over Stefan and me,

00:21.800 --> 00:22.847
every chance you had.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.121
Please forgive me.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.322
You're either a Salvatore,
or you're one of us.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.443
You are wrong, Julian.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.211
- Lily!

00:30.600 --> 00:31.965
- Damon...
- Say something.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.327
You made your bed. Have a nice nap.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.167
All she wanted was forgiveness,
and you practically spat in her face.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.885
She didn't deserve my forgiveness.

00:39.160 --> 00:42.687
"The Phoenix Stone gives the sword
its power against immortal foes."

00:43.000 --> 00:44.968
When a vampire is stabbed
through the heart,

00:45.120 --> 00:46.849
the sword acts as a magical conduit

00:47.040 --> 00:49.964
transferring their spirit
into this nasty stone.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.207
(GRUNTING)

00:51.480 --> 00:54.006
JULIAN: The purpose of the stone
is to punish vampires.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.366
Every sin you've committed,

00:55.560 --> 00:58.564
goes into creating
your own little personal hell.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.526
-(GASPS)
- CAROLINE: Stefan!

01:00.720 --> 01:02.484
JULIAN: I don't know
what your hell will be,

01:02.640 --> 01:03.880
but I hope she's there.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.209

Henry.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.246

01:51.600 --> 01:52.886
You must help me.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.080
News from home?

02:42.800 --> 02:43.847
My brother.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.286
STEFAN: "Dear Damon.

02:45.680 --> 02:47.921
"They tell us to only send good news,
but I cannot.

(HORSE NEIGHS)

03:41.880 --> 03:43.166
Colonel, sir.

03:43.680 --> 03:44.966
Lieutenant Salvatore.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.162
I would like to request
two weeks leave to go home, sir.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.405
You and every man out here, Salvatore.

03:51.640 --> 03:52.721
No. Request denied.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.367
I fear my brother
is in a very bad way, sir.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.085
I would not ask if I did not believe

03:57.400 --> 03:58.640
he truly needs me.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.242
I do not wish to shirk my duties.
If there is something you need done,

04:04.480 --> 04:05.720
I shall do it.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.401
Anything?

04:08.680 --> 04:10.045
Anything. Yes, sir.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.366
All right, then.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.761
I've got a mission.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.843
Honestly, it's more of a chore.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.161
For a chance to see my brother,
I will gladly accept.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.848
There's a farmhouse 12 miles to the east.

04:21.279 --> 04:25.285
Rumor is, there are Union sympathizers
there hiding Confederate deserters.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.567
Now if these rumors are true,

04:26.760 --> 04:29.240
I need those deserters arrested
and brought back to me.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.846
Consider it done.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.200
Thank you, sir.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.520
Thank you, sir.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.288
HENRY: Two weeks at home? Can you imagine?

04:40.120 --> 04:43.408
How grand.
I cannot wait to see my girl, Olive.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.886
She's a real peach.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.964
You have a sweetheart, Damon?

04:47.160 --> 04:48.810
No. But I have to see my brother.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.806
- Damon, are you certain about this?
- About what, Henry?

04:54.280 --> 04:55.566
About the mission.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.247
These men?

04:57.480 --> 04:59.209
These deserters,
we are supposed to capture?

04:59.600 --> 05:02.604
They are just regular fellows
who do not believe in the cause.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.484
Like me. Like you.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.371
It is true.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.130
I could give a damn about this war, Henry.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.926
To be honest,
I only enlisted to please my father.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.161
But then how can you be fine
with rounding up men just like you?

05:15.480 --> 05:17.448
It is not my fault they deserted, Henry.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.926
They made their beds.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.720
But now they're our ticket home.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.606
Hello, ma'am.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.923
Could you spare some dinner
for two hungry soldiers?

05:35.400 --> 05:36.686
No. Sorry.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.566
(DAMON GRUNTS)

05:40.400 --> 05:43.847
I do not need to remind you
that quartering is your wartime duty.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.011
Not to mention the law.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.720
Thank you, ma'am.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.886
Hello.

-(WHISPERS) Yes, please.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.042
Henry here is going to freshen up.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.809
Clean hands, clean mind.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.691
I am sure you're not one
of those families hiding munitions

06:22.880 --> 06:25.770
from the war effort,
but orders being what they are,

06:27.280 --> 06:29.044
it is my duty to check.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.165
I'm glad to see someone takes

06:36.360 --> 06:38.488
the warning about
the devil and idle hands seriously.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.131
We have a lot of fruit.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.800
I see that, ma'am.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.530
No,no,no.No,no,no.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.289
Kindly lay your gun down.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.720
I do not want any trouble.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.650
If you turn around and go right now,
you will find none.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.446
Hello, Damon.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.644
You cannot be here.
You died of consumption.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.405
We buried you in Mystic Falls.

09:00.600 --> 09:05.208
Oh, my sweet, sweet son.
I'm dead, all right.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.080
You saw to that.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.929
You died. I was there.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.885
This doesn't make any sense.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.450
But it's starting to come back to you.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.406
This isn't real.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.604
Your spirit is trapped inside
the Phoenix Stone.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.611
This really happened, didn't it?

09:42.800 --> 09:46.850
In 1863, I got a letter from Stefan,
he seemed hopeless.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.964
I just wanted to go home to him.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.166
Even though I had my doubts,
I started to round up deserters.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.165
It all went so wrong so fast.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.807
Did you ever take responsibility
for the incident?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.047
What do you mean?

09:59.280 --> 10:03.330
You and Henry covered it up
and never spoke of it again.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.607
How do you know that?

10:06.800 --> 10:10.282
Maybe, it's time to give yourself up.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.162
Why? For what?

10:16.200 --> 10:18.441
They were deserters. They ambushed us.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.762
I didn't come here looking
to kill anybody.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.926
You had your reservations.
But you still marched forward.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.163
So, hell is being raked
over the coals for something

10:27.360 --> 10:29.283
I haven't thought about in 150 years?

10:30.760 --> 10:32.000
Sorry.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.403
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.365
The longer you keep your trauma
at arm's length,

10:38.280 --> 10:40.009
the harder this is going to be for you.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.760
I see.

And this PTSD puppet show
wouldn't happen to be, by chance,

10:48.320 --> 10:51.369
a ploy to get me to feel remorse
for your pointless death.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.084
'Cause it ain't working, Mama.

- This isn't about remorse, Damon.

-(SIGHS)

11:26.240 --> 11:27.844
Like, I just lived a day in the life

11:29.120 --> 11:30.770
of young Damon Salvatore.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.680
A day?

11:35.120 --> 11:37.122
Damon, you've been dead for three months.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.486
You're sure you're okay?

11:56.280 --> 11:59.409
No desire to lash out, or break anything?

12:00.920 --> 12:03.207
Nope. But you don't look so good.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.921
I'm fine. Just weak.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.603
Took three heretics to successfully
find Julian's spirit in that stone,

12:13.800 --> 12:16.770
and I did it solo.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.006
Wow.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.369
It's not that I was expecting a parade,
but where's my parade?

12:24.560 --> 12:25.766
BONNIE: Caroline's at Whitmore.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.167
Alaric's had a lecture
and Matt's on patrol.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.410
I'm sorry. (STUTTERS)
It's been three months, it's not like--

12:31.640 --> 12:34.644
Time stood still. I get it.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.880
No offense taken.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.880
Where's Stefan?

12:40.280 --> 12:41.520
You're gonna need another.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.647
Where is he, Bonnie?

12:45.800 --> 12:48.246
When Julian stabbed you,
Nora stabbed Stefan.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.763
And I... I haven't been able
to bring him back yet.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.450
You're telling me my brother's
still stuck in here,

12:52.640 --> 12:53.687
and you brought me out first?

12:53.880 --> 12:56.121
That didn't sound even like
a glimmer of a "Thank you."

12:56.320 --> 12:58.163
Where is he, Bonnie?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.691
- He's in his bedroom.
- We have to get him out.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.410
I will when I can, Damon.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.763
It took all of my magic
just to pull you out.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.769
I don't care, Bonnie, now.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.649
- Did you store him in the closet?
- He was just in here.

13:20.840 --> 13:21.887
Well, he's not now, Bonnie.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.127
Which begs the question,

13:23.360 --> 13:25.681
how do you not see an unconscious
vampire walk out the front door?

13:28.560 --> 13:30.289
Because he didn't walk out the front door.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.206
Someone took him.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.809
If Julian were in Mystic Falls,
I think I'd know.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.121
Don't you think you're giving yourself

13:41.320 --> 13:42.481
a little too much credit there, Donovan?

13:42.680 --> 13:44.887
All I'm saying is the guy's not shy
about making himself known.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.851
Matt, if Julian scorches Stefan's body
we can't get him back.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.520
No one's scorching anyone, not yet.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.650
Listen, Julian left a note.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.525
He's clearly luring us somewhere
for a reason, guys.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.324
- Could always try a locator spell.
- DAMON: Hmm.

13:57.560 --> 14:01.246
Bonnie, no way, you literally
just dragged Damon out of hell.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.323
I can't even believe
you're standing right now.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.760
She isn't talking to you, mama bear.

(SIGHS)

14:06.680 --> 14:07.920
You think you have enough juice?

14:09.320 --> 14:10.560
I guess we can find out.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.643
Bonnie, you've been exhausting
yourself every day

14:12.880 --> 14:13.961
for the last few months.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.521
At least let me check
the town's surveillance tapes first.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.767
DAMON: You and who else?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.128
Unless the Mystic Falls police
department's had a hiring surge

14:20.320 --> 14:21.924
since I was out.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.680
I didn't think so.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.520
Can you find him?

14:26.760 --> 14:28.000
I'll see what I can do.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.327
(SIGHS)

14:30.520 --> 14:32.602
(CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

14:41.200 --> 14:42.486
Dflnk?

14:42.960 --> 14:44.246
I'm 28 weeks pregnant.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.640
Is that a yes or a no?

14:47.440 --> 14:50.523
What is it like inside your head?
I'm genuinely curious.

14:50.760 --> 14:54.128
Because it must be wonderfully
liberating to only see

14:54.320 --> 14:55.367
what you wanna see.

14:55.560 --> 14:56.925
- You know what I'm curious about?
- Hmm.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.004
Why the Phoenix Stone made
my mother a character in my hellscape

15:00.200 --> 15:03.124
when it had so many other options
of torture to choose from?

15:03.320 --> 15:06.085
Yeah. And this is why I begged Bonnie
to get Stefan out first.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.282
- Then why didn't she?
- Because logic prevailed.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.200
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

15:11.720 --> 15:12.960
Nothing.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.961
Blondie, you do not get
to make this moment

15:19.600 --> 15:21.921
the only time you ever decided to shut up.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.202
Tell me. What am I missing?

15:24.480 --> 15:26.482
Look, (SIGHS)

15:27.000 --> 15:28.570
I don't know
what you've just been through,

15:28.760 --> 15:30.410
or what it's like in that thing.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.525
But the longer that you are trapped,

15:32.720 --> 15:34.927
the more your humanity
gets stripped away.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.761
Well, here I am all full of emotions.
The question is, why isn't my brother?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.889
Because we figured
if you were gone too long,

15:41.120 --> 15:43.407
you would come back devoid of humanity,

15:43.600 --> 15:45.841
hell-bent on killing Bonnie
to revive Elena.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.966

(BREATHING HEAVILY) The spell worked.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.603
-cute witch or the pregnant blonde. But--
-(DOOR CLOSES)

16:15.920 --> 16:17.922
Well, you're just gonna have
to settle for the ornery brother.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.600
Fine.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.366
What's that putrid smell?

16:21.560 --> 16:24.370
Ah, that, yes. (SMACKS LIPS)

16:24.680 --> 16:26.364
See, I was at a petrol station earlier,

16:26.680 --> 16:29.160
and I got a little bit carried away
with the nozzle.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.688
I'm afraid your brother is quite soaked.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.764
Come on. Sit down.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.530
If you're not gonna join me for the meal,

16:42.880 --> 16:45.201
I suppose I could just skip forward
to the after dinner smoke.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.883
So, do you want to talk about it?

16:56.080 --> 16:57.206
Are we really doing this?

16:57.400 --> 16:58.686
Yes, we're really doing this.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.048
You know, I've never had the opportunity
to share war stories

17:01.240 --> 17:02.480
with another stone survivor.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.842
Come on, how'd you fare?
Tell me everything.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.569
Gladly. As soon as Stefan's home
and soul-sucked out of that rock.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.047
We can all sit, pop open
a bottle of chardonnay,

17:11.240 --> 17:13.163
chat and eat bonbons
till the sun comes up.

(CHUCKLES)

17:15.520 --> 17:16.726
Hmm.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.762
Perhaps I should start. (INHALES)

17:19.440 --> 17:22.125
So, upon waking up in that wretched world,

17:23.240 --> 17:24.810
I saw your mother.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.000
And then I killed her.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.331
Every day for over a century,

17:36.440 --> 17:37.680
I watched her die.

17:38.520 --> 17:42.411
Every day, for over a century,
I had my heart torn out of my chest.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.285
Yeah, it was complete and utter misery.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.090
Well, I had a slightly
different experience.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.844
Overall, I'd give hell one star for horror

17:53.040 --> 17:55.884
and two very disappointed thumbs down
for clever use of parable.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.240
So, it didn't work on you.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.245
It was called hell.
Let's just say I had expectations.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.851
I think you simply resisted.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.760
Resisted what?

18:12.240 --> 18:13.526
DAMON: No! No! (GRUNTS)

18:13.800 --> 18:18.124

No.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.520
Yes.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.440
This isn't real.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.650
Pain is real. Feeling is real.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.211
As soon as you figure that out,
you'll be one step closer.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.640

what would you say
if I asked for two weeks leave

19:57.440 --> 19:58.487
to go see my brother?

19:58.680 --> 20:00.603
You and every other man out here,
Salvatore. No.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.200
Ithoughtso.

20:04.800 --> 20:09.089
What if I was willing to help you
with your little deserter problem?

20:09.280 --> 20:10.566
For example.

20:12.480 --> 20:13.641
Well, now that you mentioned it,

20:13.840 --> 20:16.730
there's a farmhouse
about 12 miles east of here.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.687
And rumor is, they are
Union sympathizers there.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.120
I'm on it.

20:21.360 --> 20:24.523
Just to get the rules clear,
I bring these deserters back alive,

20:25.160 --> 20:26.491
I go home to see my brother.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.971
Yes. Yes, Lieutenant.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.800
All right, then.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.046
HENRY: Two weeks at home?

20:33.480 --> 20:34.641
How grand.

20:34.840 --> 20:38.003
I cannot wait to see my girl, Olive.
She's a real peach.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.480
You have a sweetheart, Damon?

20:41.640 --> 20:43.404
Yes. No. I mean,

20:45.200 --> 20:47.328
I gotta admit, things are little fuzzy
right now, Henry.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.843
These men. These deserters
we are supposed to capture.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.402
Aren't they just regular fellows
like you and me?

20:56.640 --> 20:57.880
Technically, yes.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.365
But I'm starting to think they stand
for something much bigger now.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.607
Of course, they do.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.768
They are protesting on behalf
of their political beliefs.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.326
That they are, Henry.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.524
But they're my ticket out of here,
and I've gotta bring them back alive.

for two hungry soldiers?

I'd like to remind you that
quartering is the law in these parts.

- There aren't, Henry.

ask you to set that knife down

And you did it solo. Got it.

keeping Stefan's body.

relax and not have to worry

where we compare notes?

grief, and pain on a perpetual loop.

where we get drunk.

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.970
Why? What happened to you in there?

24:26.400 --> 24:30.928
It was just a gruesome Civil War saga.

to my sad sack of a brother,

so I could help him
get over a girl he just met.

So, the part with the innocent
people bleeding out

26:53.680 --> 26:56.923
It's the sliver of hope that
you can actually get out on your own.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.691
How come we had no trouble reuniting
your soul with your body?

27:03.480 --> 27:06.609
Because eventually I submitted to the
kind of suffering that just breaks you.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.729
Knowing Damon, he'll do anything he can
to avoid that pain.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.922
Which means we may never be able
to get him out.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.607
HENRY: Two weeks at home?

27:24.760 --> 27:27.331
- I can't wait to see my girl, Olive.
- Bet she's a real peach.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.245
And yes, Henry, I have a girl.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.807
She's in a sleeping beauty spell,
long story.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.725
So here's what I'm thinking. Why today?

27:34.040 --> 27:35.929
Out of all of Damon Salvatore's
greatest hits,

27:36.120 --> 27:38.441
this farmhouse kerfuffle
was barely a B-side.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.842
And then I realized,
this is where it all began.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.088
This was the first time
I ever had blood on my hands.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.448
I took that mission. I gave the order.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.371
Damon, I don't think you are well.
Perhaps your fever is back.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.806
Maybe, we should...
Maybe we should turn around.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.161
I'm not sick, Henry.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.364
The point is, is that the weeks
after the farmhouse massacre,

27:54.720 --> 27:57.326
when I was crushed by guilt
and self-loathing,

27:57.600 --> 28:00.080
do you know the one person in the
world that I wanted to talk to?

28:01.720 --> 28:02.767
My brother.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.440
That has to be the solution
to this hell-puzzle, too.

28:05.760 --> 28:09.162
We find a way to get to Stefan,
and we stop reliving this day

28:09.360 --> 28:11.328
over and over, and over again.

28:11.560 --> 28:12.607
That make sense?

28:12.800 --> 28:15.724
We are returning to camp, I insist.
You are not yourself.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.002
Do you want leave to see
your peach of a sweetheart?

28:18.840 --> 28:20.080
Do you, Henry?

28:22.240 --> 28:25.483
Then follow my lead, Wattles.
I'm gonna get this right.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.320
(SIGHS)

28:33.440 --> 28:34.566
Hello, beautiful.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.000
What a great smile you have.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.522
I'm gonna need you,
your daughter and grandma

28:38.720 --> 28:40.768
to come out here, on the porch,
with Private Wattles.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.520
Soldier's orders.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.206
Come on out, ladies.
That's right, thank you.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.481
Right here,
just right there on the porch.

28:51.680 --> 28:52.966
Very nice.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.684
Stay on the porch. It's a nice day.

(HENRY SIGHS)

29:05.880 --> 29:07.120
I know you're down there.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.205
I need you to toss out your weapons
on the count of three,

29:10.400 --> 29:12.129
or I will kill your host family.

29:14.080 --> 29:17.289
One, two...

29:21.800 --> 29:23.040
Three.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.402
That's good. Now, come out.

29:27.320 --> 29:30.085
One at a time, arms raised.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.848

You've been out a long time.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.480
Let's try this again.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.081
Okay. I know you have a grenade.

29:55.480 --> 30:00.611
This time I need you to gently slide
the grenade out to me first.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.003
Next, I want your revolvers.

30:03.320 --> 30:06.051
And I want all of this
on the count of three,

30:06.280 --> 30:07.770
or I kill your host family.

30:08.480 --> 30:12.121
One, two...

30:14.280 --> 30:15.520
Three!

30:16.520 --> 30:18.966
Now, come out.
One at a time, arms raised.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.480
Arms raised.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.891
HENRY: Damon.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.570
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

30:28.320 --> 30:30.243
I'm really starting to hate you three.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.611
HENRY: Hi there, hero.
You've been out a long time.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.246
Mail call.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.411
HENRY: News from home?

30:49.080 --> 30:50.411
What did you go and do that for?

30:53.520 --> 30:56.524
"Stefan, never write

30:57.120 --> 30:58.770
"me again."

31:01.280 --> 31:02.441
- Mail!

You've been out a long time.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.602
And if you bring
the deserters back to me,

31:08.800 --> 31:10.609
then you shall have your leave, Salvatore.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.611
Does the offer still stand
if I bring them back dead?

Screw this.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.242
Damon? Where you going?

31:53.440 --> 31:56.410
The shortest distance between
point A and point B is, Henry?

31:56.960 --> 31:58.928
- What?
- A straight line.

31:59.400 --> 32:00.526
To get out of this hell,

32:00.760 --> 32:02.842
I gotta see my brother,
so I'm going straight to him.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.806
I'm deserting the Mystic Falls.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.128
Really? Can I come with you?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.169
You know how you always say
I'm a hero, Henry?

I'm no hero.

33:24.520 --> 33:25.760
Well, this is different.

- Where the hell is everybody?
- LILY: Keep your voice down.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.684
I can see them coming in the distance.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.286
Who?

33:34.160 --> 33:37.369
Confederates are hunting deserters.
They will kill you.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.286
You need to hide in the cellar.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.763
Okay, this whole urgency thing
isn't necessary

33:42.040 --> 33:43.929
because this isn't actually happening.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.930
Damon. You are not hearing me.
They are here.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.884
Get down to the cellar
if you want to live.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.881
Brother.

34:00.120 --> 34:03.647
Well, well, if it isn't the light
at the end of the tunnel.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.771
Pretty dark tunnel,
this little slaughterhouse.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.929
I can see why you never told me about it.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.811
I was trying to protect
your fragile emotions, Stefan.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.409
You're the reason
I took the mission to begin with.

34:14.639 --> 34:15.880
(CHUCKLES)

34:16.560 --> 34:18.324
You always have a reason,
don't you, Damon?

34:19.239 --> 34:22.449
Your brother... Drinking buddy.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.326
Her.

34:30.120 --> 34:31.326
Elena.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.324
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.250
Proving that I do bad things
for the people that I love?

34:40.440 --> 34:43.762
This isn't about what you do
in her name, Damon.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.688
It's about what you do in her absence.

35:00.800 --> 35:01.926
You don't get it, do you?

35:02.160 --> 35:04.845
You tell yourself that you're
protecting Mystic Falls for Elena.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.521
You convince yourself
that you're keeping her safe

35:07.680 --> 35:08.966
by any means necessary.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.970
You justify punishing Lily
for Elena's sake.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.170
Did you ever once think,
what would Elena do?

35:15.440 --> 35:17.966
I never got a chance to ask her.
Thanks to Lily.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.442
Ah! So, you had to ask?

35:20.840 --> 35:25.323
Is Elena's influence on you so weak
that you can't tell right from wrong

35:25.560 --> 35:27.369
without her holding your hand?

recognize you when she wakes up.
