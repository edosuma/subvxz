Seriously, dude?

09:19.250 --> 09:20.880
[fire demons roars]

09:20.880 --> 09:22.960
Oh, right. Aah!

09:25.000 --> 09:26.540
[fire demon shrieks]

09:33.290 --> 09:36.170
-[Marco sighs]
-[Brunzetta laughs]

09:36.170 --> 09:38.710
I haven't seen a fight
like that in ages.

09:38.710 --> 09:41.500
Yeah, just like
old times.

09:41.500 --> 09:45.000
Indeed. Well, until
we meet again, Yammy.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.790
[chuckles]
Brunzetta out!

09:51.080 --> 09:52.750
[sighs]
Bye, Brunzetta!

09:52.750 --> 09:54.750
Please don't
forget about me.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.250
What?

09:56.250 --> 09:59.250
[Neverzonians moaning]

09:59.250 --> 10:01.120
The beast
has been defeated!

10:01.120 --> 10:03.380
You can all
finally relax.

10:03.380 --> 10:04.750
Took you
long enough.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.380
That demon may be gone,

10:06.380 --> 10:08.830
but our castle
is still a hot mess.

10:08.830 --> 10:10.920
My crops are
all fried, man.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.330
Well, dang,
ungrateful.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.960
Come on, tough guy,
let's go home.

10:16.290 --> 10:18.920
Here, take these
until I get back.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.170
Back? Back
from where?

10:20.170 --> 10:22.120
I may have returned
El Choppo,

10:22.120 --> 10:23.330
but that doesn't make up

10:23.330 --> 10:25.380
for the thousands
of years of terror

10:25.380 --> 10:28.040
that I inflicted upon
these poor creatures.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.670
I'm going to stay,

10:29.670 --> 10:31.920
and help them
rebuild their castle.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.290
What? No, Marco.

10:33.290 --> 10:34.500
You don't have
to do this.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.540
You're a good person.

10:35.540 --> 10:36.790
You just
made a mistake.

10:36.790 --> 10:39.790
I can't run from
my misdeeds, Star.

10:39.790 --> 10:42.670
I must make right
with these wraiths.

10:42.670 --> 10:46.120
Until then, I won't
be right... with me.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.710
[cries] Oh, Marco.

10:48.710 --> 10:52.000
You are, like,
so hot right now!

10:52.000 --> 10:54.540
[inhales] I know.

10:54.540 --> 10:56.880
Oh! Aah!
[grunts]

10:56.880 --> 10:58.080
[Nachos lightly roars]

11:01.170 --> 11:04.330
Oh, Nachos,
I'm really
gonna miss him.

11:06.830 --> 11:07.880
[sighs] Whoo!

11:07.880 --> 11:09.460
-Marco!
-Star?

11:09.460 --> 11:11.040
Is that you?

11:11.040 --> 11:12.750
[sighs]
It's been so long.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.250
Uh, but I have
so much to tell you!

11:14.250 --> 11:15.790
The castle's all finished,

11:15.790 --> 11:17.210
I learned to speak Merman,

11:17.210 --> 11:19.040
I got my first gray hair,

11:19.040 --> 11:21.330
I taught a group of
underprivileged gnomes
how to dance.

11:21.330 --> 11:24.330
Aww, welcome home, Yammy.
