SARAH JANE:
<i>Twenty four children have</i>
<i>disappeared recently,</i>

00:07.407 --> 00:08.575
<i>all in cities where</i>
<i>there's a Combat 3000,</i>

00:08.641 --> 00:10.477
<i>every time in the middle</i>
<i>of a freak storm.</i>

00:10.543 --> 00:12.645
Help me get
my boy back, Miss Smith.

00:12.712 --> 00:13.980
SARAH JANE:
<i>Why would it</i>
<i>rain like that?</i>

00:14.047 --> 00:15.148
MR SMITH: <i>Insufficient data.</i>

00:15.215 --> 00:17.984
Maybe we can
get you some more.

00:18.051 --> 00:21.821
MARIA: <i>Wow!</i>
MR SMITH: <i>Particles identified</i>
<i>as entanglement shells.</i>

00:21.888 --> 00:24.357
<i>Entanglement shells can also</i>
<i>be a by-product</i>

00:24.424 --> 00:27.227
<i>of some form of</i>
<i>trans-dimensional</i>
<i>energy dispersal.</i>

00:27.293 --> 00:28.561
Teleportation.

00:28.628 --> 00:29.662
What are we looking for?

00:30.697 --> 00:31.831
Perhaps I can help.

00:31.898 --> 00:33.633
Mr Grantham, I presume.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.936
Not Mr Kudlak, no, I hear
he stays in the shadows.
I wonder why that is!

00:37.137 --> 00:39.372
Just bring me children.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.207
<i>Someone shows promise!</i>

00:41.274 --> 00:42.642
-(LASER GUNS SHOOTING)
-GRANTHAM: <i>Yeah, there's</i>
<i>a couple of kids.</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:44.511
<i>One of them's</i>
<i>really something.</i>

00:45.512 --> 00:47.313
(SCREAMING)

00:47.380 --> 00:49.549
What exactly does
a matter transporter
look like?

00:49.616 --> 00:51.251
It's Luke and Clyde!

00:51.317 --> 00:52.585
No!

01:09.669 --> 01:12.071
Whoa! What was all that about?

01:12.138 --> 01:14.240
If you ask me,
someone went over the top

01:14.307 --> 01:15.708
with the effects budget
on this place.

01:15.775 --> 01:18.111
-I feel sick.
-Well, do me a favour,

01:18.178 --> 01:21.281
if this is where they
hand us the trophy,
don't puke in it.

01:21.347 --> 01:25.251
No, I don't like
to kill unarmed
women and children,

01:25.318 --> 01:28.888
-but forgive me,
this is war.
-Run!

01:34.127 --> 01:35.929
Why are you an idiot?

01:42.535 --> 01:43.670
Run!

01:43.736 --> 01:45.438
(PANTING)

01:51.544 --> 01:54.380
-Where now?
-There must be
an emergency exit.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.590
-Are you all right?
-UNIT training.
Never forget it.

02:03.656 --> 02:05.792
-(GRUNTING)
-Just getting a little older,
that's all.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.160
-(HISSING)
-This way!

02:11.831 --> 02:14.534
-Please! Come on!
-Stand back!

02:20.607 --> 02:23.443
-What about Luke and Clyde?
-They're not there any more,
but we'll find them!

02:23.510 --> 02:25.879
First, we have to find out
who we're up against!

02:29.449 --> 02:32.252
Where is everyone?
I want my ticket
to the world championships.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.820
I thought you were
getting worried before.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.755
Nah, adrenaline-hype,
that's all.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.323
Look, nothing's
happened to us.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.192
We're just stuck in this room
off the arena

02:39.259 --> 02:42.328
waiting for that Grantham guy
to come and get us.

02:42.395 --> 02:44.864
I don't know, Clyde.
Something's not right.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.967
Oh, about time!

02:48.034 --> 02:50.503
-(GRUNTS)
-You the honour guards?
You gonna do this properly?

02:50.570 --> 02:53.039
Oh! You know what, Luke,
I like their style...

02:53.106 --> 02:54.874
Hey! What are doing with me?
Get off me!

02:55.608 --> 02:56.843
What?

02:56.910 --> 02:57.877
Ah!

02:58.711 --> 03:00.847
Clyde!

03:00.914 --> 03:03.316
Let me out! What you doing?

03:04.450 --> 03:06.152
You have compromised
the mission!

03:06.219 --> 03:08.855
What? The woman
and female child have escaped!

03:08.922 --> 03:11.925
You went after them.
If they got away,
it's your fault.

03:11.991 --> 03:15.228
Your security of this compound
should never have allowed
them access.

03:15.295 --> 03:20.400
You're a liability to the
success of this operation and
to the survival of my people.

03:20.466 --> 03:25.305
You are a disgrace to
your own species, Grantham.
You have always sickened me.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.740
Killing you will be a service
to both our worlds.

03:27.807 --> 03:31.344
No! Please! Please...

03:31.411 --> 03:33.146
MISTRESS: <i>Kudlak?</i>
<i>What is happening?</i>

03:33.212 --> 03:36.583
The mission is compromised,
Mistress. We must evacuate.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.117
<i>No! You will stay there.</i>

03:38.184 --> 03:40.587
<i>You must send me children!</i>
<i>More children!</i>

03:40.653 --> 03:43.756
-But the security
has been breached.
<i>-Do not argue, Kudlak.</i>

03:43.823 --> 03:48.194
<i>-I am your Mistress!</i>
-Yes, Mistress.

03:48.261 --> 03:51.831
It sounds like
you'll be needing me around
a little bit more, Mr Kudlak.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.168
I think I know how to sort
your security problem.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.503
(ROARS)

03:57.570 --> 03:59.038
Mr Smith, I need you.

04:06.346 --> 04:08.481
Luke and Clyde have been
abducted by an alien.

04:08.548 --> 04:11.050
-I need you
to identify the species.
-MR SMITH: <i>Please describe.</i>

04:11.117 --> 04:14.120
Um... Humanoid. Brownish face.

04:14.187 --> 04:18.024
-Kinda slimy.
-Wide cheekbones.
No, wider.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.591
And big eyes.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.763
Yes! I think that's it!

04:23.830 --> 04:27.033
<i>Uvodni. Their home planet</i>
<i>is in the Spiral Cluster</i>
<i>of the Dragon Nebula,</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:29.402
<i>34,000 light years from Earth.</i>

04:29.469 --> 04:30.703
His name is Kudlak.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.840
<i>Accessing Uvodni database.</i>
<i>Kudlak.</i>

04:33.906 --> 04:35.808
<i>General Uvlavad Kudlak.</i>

04:35.875 --> 04:38.811
<i>One of the</i>
<i>Uvodni Signus Brigade's</i>
<i>most decorated warriors.</i>

04:38.878 --> 04:41.781
-A soldier.
<i>-The Uvodni were part</i>
<i>of a planetary alliance</i>

04:41.848 --> 04:44.550
<i>that fought the</i>
<i>Malakh in the Ghost Wars</i>
<i>of the Horsehead Nebula.</i>

04:44.617 --> 04:47.353
-Who are the Malakh?
-Not very nice to know.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.122
They'd start a war with you
just for looking at them.

04:49.188 --> 04:52.325
<i>When other allied worlds</i>
<i>had been crushed</i>
<i>by the Malakh empire,</i>

04:52.392 --> 04:53.960
<i>the Uvodni continued to fight.</i>

04:54.027 --> 04:56.229
But why is Kudlak on Earth,
abducting children?

04:56.295 --> 04:59.732
<i>My last data registration</i>
<i>of General Kudlak is</i>
<i>from a cyber-con download</i>

04:59.799 --> 05:01.567
<i>with a Zantoxian trade vessel</i>

05:01.634 --> 05:03.836
<i>that passed through the solar</i>
<i>system two months ago</i> .

05:03.903 --> 05:05.805
A what?

05:05.872 --> 05:08.307
Mr Smith sometimes
likes to connect with
on-board computers

05:08.374 --> 05:09.909
of passing alien vessels.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.612
<i>-It pays to stay in touch.</i>
-So, what about Kudlak?

05:12.679 --> 05:16.783
<i>Twenty years ago, the Uvodni</i>
<i>suffered massive casualties</i>
<i>in a battle with the Malakh.</i>

05:16.849 --> 05:19.986
<i>Kudlak was badly injured</i>
<i>and forced to</i>
<i>leave the front line.</i>

05:20.053 --> 05:22.922
Which still doesn't tell us
why he's taken Luke and Clyde.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.325
Well, maybe it does.
Remember what Grantham
said in his office?

05:26.392 --> 05:28.561
Children love war games.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.197
An old soldier like Kudlak,
he wouldn't just retire.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.832
I think he's been
here recruiting.

05:32.899 --> 05:35.068
-What?
-I think he's looking
for soldiers.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.603
I've got no signal.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.472
-You?
-Nothing. My battery's dead.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.408
Oh, man. The bucket!

05:42.475 --> 05:45.211
-This is not good.
-I think you're right.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.714
Did you feel it back then?
The floor was vibrating.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.716
-How do you mean?
-Very slightly.

05:49.782 --> 05:52.585
-Which means?
-It wasn't doing that before.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.088
I don't think we're
at Combat 3000 any more.

05:55.154 --> 05:56.556
(GRUNTING)

06:05.598 --> 06:06.733
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

06:08.367 --> 06:09.869
I think we arrived.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.011
What are you doing?

06:46.639 --> 06:51.010
If you've got any idea
what's going on around here,
I'd love to hear it.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.613
I don't think we got into
the world championships.

06:53.679 --> 06:56.115
-GIRL: Who's there?
-Did you hear that?

06:56.182 --> 06:57.383
GIRL: Who is that?

07:03.990 --> 07:07.794
Whoa! Looks like things are
finally picking up round here.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.530
-What's your name?
-Jen. Who are you?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.498
I'm Clyde.

07:14.467 --> 07:15.601
This is Luke.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.270
-BOY: Hey, get me out!
-(LOUD BANGING)

07:17.336 --> 07:19.639
Look, have you got
a good reason
for sitting in a crate

07:19.705 --> 07:23.643
or are you like us, itching
for a clue to what the hell's
going on around here?

07:23.709 --> 07:25.711
I won Level Two
at Combat 3000.

07:25.778 --> 07:29.749
-Next thing those jokers
are locking me up.
-Clyde?

07:29.816 --> 07:31.517
I think I've found you
that clue.

07:31.584 --> 07:34.620
Lance! Look, I don't want to
freak you out, mate,

07:34.687 --> 07:37.723
but your mum's
going out of her mind
worrying about you.

07:37.790 --> 07:41.527
Mr Smith, do you have a trace
on the storm today, when
Luke and Clyde were taken?

07:41.594 --> 07:44.530
MR SMITH: <i>Yes. I have been</i>
<i>monitoring weather conditions</i>
<i>across the country.</i>

07:44.597 --> 07:46.632
Is it possible to track
the transmap beam

07:46.699 --> 07:48.668
to calculate where
it's taken the boys?

07:48.734 --> 07:50.469
<i>Detection of such</i>
<i>a transmission trail,</i>

07:50.536 --> 07:52.471
<i>would require</i>
<i>synchronous data-scraping</i>

07:52.538 --> 07:55.208
<i>in all 11 dimensions</i>
<i>around Combat 3000.</i>

07:55.274 --> 07:57.210
-Can you do it?
<i>-Of course, one minute.</i>

07:57.276 --> 07:59.779
-(GLASS SHATTERS)
-Wait here.

08:07.186 --> 08:11.023
I know, I probably should
have called you first, but...

08:11.090 --> 08:13.392
Not at all, Mr Grantham.

08:13.459 --> 08:18.931
I'm always delighted to study
new forms of human low-life
in the comfort of my own home.

08:19.131 --> 08:22.602
(LAUGHING) You are
a cool old bird,
I'll give you that much.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.171
Collaborating with
an alien child abductor.

08:25.238 --> 08:29.442
(TUTTING)
That really is a new depth
in the low-life stakes.

08:29.508 --> 08:33.312
GRANTHAM: I didn't come here
to discuss my
business dealings, Miss Smith.

08:33.379 --> 08:35.448
SARAH JANE: Business dealings?

08:35.514 --> 08:38.683
You're helping that monster
press-gang children into a war
light-years away,

08:38.751 --> 08:41.888
-just for money.
-It's what makes
the galaxy go round.

08:41.953 --> 08:44.690
-Ugh, you're despicable.
-And you... (LAUGHS)

08:46.392 --> 08:48.594
You are done for.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.936
No, Mr Grantham.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.105
I think you're the one
that's done with!

09:03.175 --> 09:06.279
So we all played Combat 3000
and ended up here?

09:06.345 --> 09:07.847
And we played
all over the place...

09:07.914 --> 09:12.251
London, Brighton,
Manchester, Leeds
and Inverness.

09:12.318 --> 09:15.021
Kids from all over the country
must have been going missing.

09:15.087 --> 09:18.190
-But how did we get here?
-Wherever "here" is.

09:18.257 --> 09:21.260
What's it for?
Who are they, and what
do they want with us?

09:21.327 --> 09:24.597
I played that stupid game
again and again
just to get to Level Two,

09:24.664 --> 09:26.232
and I end up in a crate!

09:26.299 --> 09:28.367
-What's going on?
-(BEEPING)

09:29.268 --> 09:30.503
Someone's coming.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.110
CLYDE: (WHISPERING)
Just stick with me, okay?
I'll look after you.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.660
Just stick with me! (CHUCKLES)
I'll look after you!

09:56.062 --> 09:56.996
Come on!

10:00.733 --> 10:02.902
JEN: Let's go! Let's go!

10:10.977 --> 10:12.878
Where the heck are we?
Where do we go?

10:12.945 --> 10:15.514
-This way. Why not?
-Why this way?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.752
When did the moon turn blue?

10:21.087 --> 10:24.857
-That isn't the moon!
-I don't believe it.

10:26.092 --> 10:29.762
-We can't be!
-Oh, man!

10:29.829 --> 10:32.999
-We are.
-I never thought
it would be so beautiful.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.873
Oh, we are a long way
from home.

10:51.717 --> 10:54.587
MARIA: They're in space?
MR SMITH: <i>In Earth's orbit.</i>

10:54.653 --> 10:58.758
Twenty two thousand miles
over our heads.
But it could be worse.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.960
-How?
-The transporter could
have sent them

11:01.027 --> 11:02.862
right across the galaxy
to the Uvodni world.

11:03.929 --> 11:05.931
But they're in space.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.001
It doesn't matter
whether it's Earth's orbit
or the Planet of the Apes.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.804
Unless you've got a friend
at NASA with a shuttle,
we're stuffed,

11:11.871 --> 11:13.639
and so are Luke and Clyde.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.642
-Maria, we're going
to get them back.
-How?

11:16.709 --> 11:19.378
Mr Grantham
is going to help us.

11:24.150 --> 11:28.320
It's a trick.
It's got to be a trick.
We didn't fly anywhere.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.922
We were teleported.

11:29.989 --> 11:33.192
-Yeah, right!
Like, beam me up, Scotty.
-Trust me, it's real.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.227
(GUN SHOT)

11:35.294 --> 11:36.862
And that's a real gun.
Come on!

11:39.498 --> 11:42.268
-If we're really in space,
how are we gonna get away?
-He's got a point.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.470
LUKE: We'll find a way.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.541
My warriors!
Such very fine warriors.

11:55.748 --> 11:58.317
What are we doing here?
And what's with
this "warrior" stuff?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.386
All we did was win
a game of laser tag!

12:00.453 --> 12:03.122
Hey, maybe that's it!

12:03.189 --> 12:06.325
Maybe this is just another
part of the game,
Level Three.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.161
Silence! Behold your Mistress!

12:09.228 --> 12:12.932
<i>-Welcome, my warriors.</i>
-We're not warriors.
We're kids.

12:13.132 --> 12:17.703
None of those before you
had the initiative to escape
the holding deck.

12:17.770 --> 12:20.940
None forced my return
to the ship to deal with them.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.075
You are good warrior stock.

12:23.142 --> 12:27.446
-This is such rubbish.
<i>-You have proved yourself</i>
<i>in the arena.</i>

12:27.513 --> 12:32.284
<i>You have hearts of heroes.</i>
<i>You will not suffer</i>
<i>our enemies to live,</i>

12:32.351 --> 12:34.987
<i>and we will honour</i>
<i>your sacrifice.</i>

12:35.054 --> 12:37.223
Hey, Your Majesty
or whatever,

12:37.289 --> 12:39.825
no offence but I think
you're getting mixed up here.

12:39.892 --> 12:42.027
Back in the arena,
we were playing.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.931
<i>And what is play if it is</i>
<i>not a preparation for life?</i>

12:45.998 --> 12:49.401
Look, fight your own war.
It's got nothing
to do with us.

12:49.468 --> 12:50.636
We want to go home!

12:51.303 --> 12:52.638
Luke!

12:52.705 --> 12:57.009
<i>Such determination.</i>
<i>Such loyalty to each other.</i>

12:57.076 --> 12:59.545
<i>You have chosen well, Kudlak.</i>

12:59.612 --> 13:01.981
Suppose we refuse to fight.
What then?

13:02.047 --> 13:05.751
<i>Then you will be cowards.</i>
<i>You will not fall as heroes.</i>

13:05.818 --> 13:08.420
<i>But nevertheless,</i>
<i>you will die.</i>

13:08.487 --> 13:11.190
(ROARING)

13:11.257 --> 13:14.527
That tele-porter is here,
Mr Grantham, and you're
going to take us to it.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.195
And then what? (GASPS)

13:16.262 --> 13:18.631
Are you going
to beam yourself up
to the Uvodni ship

13:18.697 --> 13:20.699
and take them on
with your lipstick?

13:20.766 --> 13:23.602
You won't be so cocky
when you go down for
abducting all those children!

13:23.669 --> 13:25.571
(LAUGHING)

13:25.638 --> 13:29.475
So you're going to
tell the police that I helped
some butt-ugly alien

13:29.542 --> 13:32.745
send kids to war in
a galaxy far, far away?

13:33.812 --> 13:35.714
It won't be me
going down, love.

13:35.781 --> 13:38.117
It will be you,
down to the funny farm.

13:38.184 --> 13:39.885
Who needs to mention aliens?

13:39.952 --> 13:42.721
There's evidence to link you
to the disappearances.

13:42.788 --> 13:45.224
I doubt that men like you
fare too well in prison.

13:47.092 --> 13:50.162
All right, all right,
all right... I'll help you out
as much as I can.

13:50.229 --> 13:52.198
For all it's worth.

13:52.264 --> 13:55.734
The first thing is,
it's not Kudlak
that calls all the shots.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.908
<i>You have done well, Kudlak.</i>

14:02.975 --> 14:05.144
<i>The recruits have spirit.</i>

14:05.211 --> 14:09.381
<i>They will see it is better</i>
<i>to fight than to die</i>
<i>a coward's death.</i>

14:09.448 --> 14:14.820
How many that we have sent
into battle these last years
have survived, do you suppose?

14:14.887 --> 14:18.591
<i>We have survived, Kudlak.</i>
<i>The Uvodni have survived.</i>

14:18.657 --> 14:20.159
Yes, Mistress.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.030
<i>You seem weary, General.</i>

14:25.097 --> 14:27.633
It has been
a long war, Mistress.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.202
I grow old dreaming of peace.

14:30.269 --> 14:33.872
<i>Peace? Dreams of peace</i>
<i>are for farmers, Kudlak!</i>

14:33.939 --> 14:38.677
Of course, Mistress.
I beg forgiveness. I am tired.

14:38.744 --> 14:41.981
<i>We have done glorious work</i>
<i>for our people, Kudlak.</i>

14:42.047 --> 14:45.451
<i>Humans are among</i>
<i>the most aggressive species</i>
<i>in the galaxy.</i>

14:45.517 --> 14:47.786
<i>Their young have</i>
<i>untamed potential.</i>

14:47.853 --> 14:51.223
<i>Their imagination</i>
<i>and adaptability have,</i>
<i>for decades,</i>

14:51.290 --> 14:54.593
<i>helped our armies</i>
<i>do glorious battle</i>
<i>against the Malakh.</i>

14:54.660 --> 14:56.195
Yes, Mistress.

14:56.262 --> 14:58.597
But I wonder
how these battles fare.

14:58.664 --> 15:02.001
It has been so long since
I've heard from the front.

15:02.067 --> 15:06.805
<i>Our battles are glorious,</i>
<i>Kudlak, and one day</i>
<i>we will crush the Malakh.</i>

15:06.872 --> 15:08.741
And then there will be peace?

15:08.807 --> 15:13.078
<i>A man like you</i>
<i>should not dream of peace,</i>
<i>General Kudlak.</i>

15:13.145 --> 15:17.383
<i>Without war, the cosmos</i>
<i>has no need of us.</i>

15:17.449 --> 15:20.519
<i>Prepare the recruits for</i>
<i>transportation to the front.</i>

15:20.586 --> 15:21.954
Yes, Mistress.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.090
My dad was a soldier.

15:25.157 --> 15:27.226
He thought there were times
when you had to fight.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.862
Yeah, but this
isn't our fight.

15:33.065 --> 15:36.235
-Can I borrow
your mobile, Clyde?
-We're in space, Luke!

15:36.302 --> 15:38.837
Who are you gonna ring?
Have you got the number
for Captain Kirk?

15:38.904 --> 15:40.039
(LAUGHS)

15:40.105 --> 15:41.440
Who?

15:41.507 --> 15:43.909
Oh, just don't break it.

15:43.976 --> 15:46.812
Whatever's going on
across the galaxy,
it's nothing to do with us.

15:47.813 --> 15:49.181
Kudlak doesn't
see it like that.

15:49.248 --> 15:51.684
Forget Kudlak. We need a plan
to get out of here.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.886
JEN: But what can we do?
We're on a space ship.

15:53.952 --> 15:58.023
The only way we're getting off
is if they send us into
middle of some alien war.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.793
-Or we steal a shuttle craft.
-What did you say?

16:00.859 --> 16:03.262
I've wired Clyde's mobile
into the ship's computer.

16:03.329 --> 16:06.398
-He did what?
-Sorry. My friend's
a bit of a geek.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.766
(BEEPING)

16:10.169 --> 16:12.037
This is a plan
of the spacecraft.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.872
Just like the
Isle of Wight ferry!

16:13.939 --> 16:15.841
Yeah, that ferry! Yeah!

16:15.908 --> 16:18.944
LUKE: We're here.
This is where they took us
to see the Mistress.

16:19.011 --> 16:23.449
-And this,
I'm pretty sure, is a...
-Shuttle craft! Genius.

16:23.515 --> 16:27.286
Yeah. Genius.
He can wire your phone
into an alien computer,

16:27.353 --> 16:29.154
but can you fly
an alien shuttle craft?

16:29.221 --> 16:32.324
No. But he can wire my phone
up to an alien computer.

16:32.391 --> 16:34.426
Give the boy a chance!
He's on a roll.

16:34.493 --> 16:38.530
It doesn't matter
if he can fly it or not.
We're not going anywhere.

16:38.597 --> 16:40.099
Wanna wager?

16:46.472 --> 16:48.474
Bet, Luke. It's a bet.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.848
(THUNDER CRASHING)

17:10.896 --> 17:12.998
<i>I'll warn you again,</i>
<i>Mr Grantham.</i>

17:13.065 --> 17:15.166
If you don't uphold your side
of the bargain

17:15.233 --> 17:17.836
and see to it that we reach
the Uvodni ship in one piece,

17:17.903 --> 17:20.539
my friend, Mr Smith
has detailed files on you

17:20.606 --> 17:22.808
that will be in the hands
of the police by midnight.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.244
<i>Don't worry, Miss Smith.</i>
<i>I'll get you up</i>
<i>to the Uvodni ship.</i>

17:26.310 --> 17:30.682
Why wouldn't I? (CHUCKLES)
You're never going to
come back.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.819
<i>Oh, I'll be back, Mr Grantham.</i>
<i>I'll be back.</i>

17:58.076 --> 18:01.480
-Not far now.
-Was it first right
or second right?

18:01.547 --> 18:03.749
-Second.
-No, first! It was first.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.017
Whoa!

18:05.784 --> 18:07.853
They're over there, too.

18:19.331 --> 18:21.433
We can't fight for them
if they grease us!

18:21.500 --> 18:24.870
-Maybe we're just
too much trouble!
-Oh, yeah! We rock!

18:29.942 --> 18:32.544
-What now?
-Just stay calm.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.381
Look, I don't want to
freak you out, man,

18:36.448 --> 18:39.551
-but I'm losing "calm"
as an option here.
-(BEEPING)

18:51.497 --> 18:53.131
(GASPS)

18:55.934 --> 18:58.871
I never thought
I would lay eyes
on a sight like this again.

19:00.606 --> 19:03.242
It's incredible.

19:03.308 --> 19:07.179
Even after
everything I've seen,
I never thought I'd see this.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.915
Maybe if everybody could
see the Earth from up here,

19:09.982 --> 19:11.583
they might appreciate it more.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.753
Come on, Maria, we have to go.

19:24.329 --> 19:28.033
Okay, I've gone past
"worried", I'm not even
stopping at "anxious".

19:28.100 --> 19:30.769
I'm full-throttling into
"panicked totally
beyond reason".

19:30.836 --> 19:32.371
Will you get a move on?

19:37.175 --> 19:39.278
-You're enjoying this,
aren't you?
-Clyde, look at this.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.112
(FIRING)

19:48.220 --> 19:50.589
MISTRESS: <i>What is the meaning</i>
<i>of this? Who are you?</i>

19:50.656 --> 19:54.459
My name is Sarah Jane Smith
and I want my son back!

19:56.929 --> 20:01.033
-Clyde, look what I've just
seen in the computer banks!
-Not now, Luke, later!

20:01.099 --> 20:03.402
Clyde, look!
It's the shuttle craft!

20:03.468 --> 20:04.903
We made it!

20:19.418 --> 20:21.219
Get a move on!

20:21.286 --> 20:24.156
Warriors! I salute you!

20:24.222 --> 20:27.259
Yours is without doubt
the finest war blood

20:27.326 --> 20:29.528
I have been honoured
to gather.

20:29.595 --> 20:34.866
And now it is time to leave,
to take your place on
the Uvodni front line!

20:38.303 --> 20:40.205
<i>What do you know of my war?</i>

20:40.272 --> 20:42.908
I know war, any war,
is no place for children.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.043
No matter how desperate
your people may be.

20:45.110 --> 20:49.748
<i>My people are not desperate!</i>
<i>They are proud!</i>
<i>They are victorious!</i>

20:49.815 --> 20:51.450
Victorious?
Is that what you call people

20:51.516 --> 20:53.785
that use somebody else's
children to fight their war?

20:53.852 --> 20:56.555
<i>Your species have</i>
<i>a hunger for battle!</i>

20:56.622 --> 20:59.291
We don't! The children don't!

20:59.358 --> 21:01.426
We've seen what adults
have done to the world
with their war

21:01.493 --> 21:02.628
and we don't want it any more.

21:02.694 --> 21:05.163
<i>Lies! I've seen your games.</i>

21:05.230 --> 21:08.400
It's pretend!
Can't you understand that?

21:08.467 --> 21:11.503
The children you've sent
to fight the Malakh might
score high in a game.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.905
That's not the same
as fighting in a battlefield.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.942
<i>They adapt or fall.</i>

21:17.009 --> 21:19.911
And just how victorious
are your battles, Mistress?

21:19.978 --> 21:21.880
What is the word
from the front?

21:21.947 --> 21:23.515
<i>Hmm...</i>

21:23.582 --> 21:27.152
Mistress, your warriors
are ready! Intruders!

21:27.219 --> 21:28.520
<i>Execute them, Kudlak!</i>

21:28.587 --> 21:29.821
Mum!

21:31.790 --> 21:34.359
And I had such hopes for you,
young warrior!

21:34.426 --> 21:37.596
No, no! He's not a warrior!
None of them are warriors,
they're children!

21:37.663 --> 21:39.665
War changes everything!

21:39.731 --> 21:42.868
-Stop. The war is over.
-What is this?

21:42.934 --> 21:45.470
<i>Lies, Kudlak! Execute them!</i>

21:45.537 --> 21:47.239
I found this
in your computer banks.

21:47.305 --> 21:48.707
This is trickery!

21:48.774 --> 21:50.475
No! Let him show you.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.944
I hacked into
your ship's computer.
That's how we escaped.

21:54.346 --> 21:55.747
I found this by accident.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.816
<i>I will not</i>
<i>permit this, Kudlak.</i>

21:59.551 --> 22:04.489
<i>Vessels of the Imperial Fleet,</i>
<i>this is your Emperor.</i>

22:04.556 --> 22:08.360
<i>We have agreed an armistice</i>
<i>with the Malakh.</i>

22:08.427 --> 22:11.830
<i>After all these centuries,</i>
<i>peace at last!</i>

22:11.897 --> 22:14.366
<i>Come home,</i>
<i>all my proud warriors.</i>

22:14.433 --> 22:16.635
<i>Come home.</i>
<i>We have much to rebuild.</i>

22:16.702 --> 22:19.037
What Malakh
subterfuge is this?

22:19.104 --> 22:22.207
Luke found it in
your data banks! You have
to believe it, Kudlak.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.876
The war is over!

22:24.943 --> 22:28.046
According to the data,
that message is 10 years old.

22:28.113 --> 22:32.484
Ten years? The Mistress
would have told me!
We would have gone home!

22:32.551 --> 22:35.020
This is a trick!
You wish to destroy us!

22:35.087 --> 22:38.156
No, Kudlak.
We don't want to destroy you.

22:38.223 --> 22:40.358
No matter what your Mistress
has told you,

22:40.425 --> 22:43.829
Earth wants to live
in peace with its neighbours.

22:43.895 --> 22:47.032
But, Mistress, is this true?

22:47.099 --> 22:49.067
Is the war ended
all these years?

22:50.569 --> 22:52.370
Perhaps she doesn't
want to go home.

22:52.437 --> 22:55.941
Perhaps without a war
there's no need for her.
Or for you.

22:56.007 --> 22:58.610
Mistress?

22:58.677 --> 23:01.379
<i>-Peace does not compute.</i>
-What?

23:01.446 --> 23:03.081
<i>Peace does not compute.</i>

23:03.148 --> 23:06.051
(DISTORTED) <i>Peace does not,</i>
<i>not compute.</i>

23:06.118 --> 23:08.286
The Mistress,
she's a computer!

23:08.353 --> 23:10.021
She buried the message
from your Emperor!

23:10.088 --> 23:11.523
Is it true, Mistress?

23:11.590 --> 23:14.025
<i>I am not programmed for peace.</i>

23:14.092 --> 23:17.596
<i>The scenario does not compute.</i>
<i>It cannot be real!</i>

23:17.662 --> 23:20.165
You never expected
the war to end!

23:20.232 --> 23:22.968
Your computers were never
programmed to recognise it
when it happened!

23:23.034 --> 23:26.838
<i>Peace is an anomaly!</i>
<i>Without war, I cannot exist!</i>

23:26.905 --> 23:30.108
The point of our war
was to achieve peace
for our home!

23:30.175 --> 23:34.146
<i>We have no home, Kudlak.</i>
<i>Except on the battlefield.</i>

23:34.212 --> 23:37.883
<i>Peace is a stranger's land.</i>
<i>We have no place there.</i>

23:37.949 --> 23:42.053
You may not, but I do! Ahhh!

23:43.355 --> 23:46.158
All these years
of peace wasted!

23:46.224 --> 23:51.630
I thought the Malakh
were my enemy,
but all this time it was you!

23:51.696 --> 23:54.866
And I will not suffer
my enemies to live!

24:06.278 --> 24:08.046
The Mistress is dead.

24:08.113 --> 24:11.616
And I have committed
an unforgivable crime
against your world.

24:13.418 --> 24:17.389
You are free and my life
is yours to take.

24:17.455 --> 24:20.992
Taking life is never
the answer, General Kudlak.

24:21.059 --> 24:24.262
Whether we have been wronged
by one man or a whole planet,

24:24.329 --> 24:26.464
it is always
the innocents that suffer.

24:26.531 --> 24:28.867
I am not an innocent.

24:28.934 --> 24:32.504
But maybe I can find
some of those that were.

24:32.571 --> 24:36.541
The ones I sent far away
and that still survive.

24:36.608 --> 24:42.180
Perhaps I can return them
and one day find
some peace for myself.

24:42.247 --> 24:45.317
I hope you can,
General Kudlak.

24:45.383 --> 24:46.852
It is my duty.

24:51.189 --> 24:52.824
We're leaving. Now.

25:10.108 --> 25:11.476
(LAUGHING)

25:12.410 --> 25:14.279
Not much of a hero's welcome!

25:14.346 --> 25:16.481
Who cares? We're back!

25:16.548 --> 25:17.515
(LAUGHS)

25:20.452 --> 25:22.520
Looks like Grantham's
done a runner.

25:22.587 --> 25:25.123
I never really expected him
to hang around, did you?

25:25.190 --> 25:27.359
He can't get away
with what he's done!
He's worse than Kudlak!

25:27.425 --> 25:31.796
Oh, don't worry. I don't think
Mr Grantham's the sort
to stay out of trouble.

25:31.863 --> 25:34.566
He'll get what's
coming to him. Eventually.

25:34.633 --> 25:35.934
Yeah, okay.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.143
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

25:45.210 --> 25:49.047
-That was a kiss!
-You saved our skin, Luke,
you deserved it. In fact...

25:50.215 --> 25:51.716
(ALL GASP)

25:53.618 --> 25:55.220
SARAH JANE: Yeah!

25:55.287 --> 25:56.855
(LAUGHING)

26:08.366 --> 26:10.235
I thought I'd lost you.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.671
I'm sorry, but I'm back now.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.873
Where have you been?

26:15.674 --> 26:16.775
Thank you.

26:20.946 --> 26:23.915
I bet he doesn't tell her
where he's been.
Boys never talk to their mums.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.650
Are you joking?

26:25.717 --> 26:28.720
How many people really
get to go up into space?
Like, uh...

26:28.787 --> 26:30.989
No one! She won't be able
to shut him up.

26:31.056 --> 26:33.325
She won't believe
a word of it, but she
won't want him to stop!

26:33.391 --> 26:36.361
I wonder if he'll be a soldier
like his dad, after everything
he's been through?

26:36.428 --> 26:39.931
After today, he might want to
be an astronaut.
Be first man on Mars!

26:40.131 --> 26:42.067
First human man
on Mars, that is!

26:43.234 --> 26:45.270
Are you all right, Luke?
Is something wrong?

26:45.337 --> 26:46.371
No, I'm fine.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.075
You were a hero
out there, mate.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.277
All that stuff with
my mobile, it was brilliant!

26:52.344 --> 26:55.180
You all needed me.
I felt like I belonged.

26:55.246 --> 26:57.949
So what's with this
sponsored silence?

26:58.016 --> 26:59.784
I'm been thinking about
something else.

26:59.851 --> 27:03.121
You know you said
anything I wanted to know,
just ask, right?

27:03.188 --> 27:05.991
Encyclopaedia Clyde-annica!
I'm your man!

27:06.057 --> 27:07.726
Tell me about girls?

27:07.792 --> 27:08.860
Oh, man!

27:09.661 --> 27:10.862
(ALL LAUGH)

27:21.873 --> 27:23.508
This is for you.

27:23.575 --> 27:26.811
He said give it to the person
you trust the most.

27:26.878 --> 27:28.380
Who is Andrea?

27:28.446 --> 27:30.281
MARIA: Dad, something
really weird is going on.

27:30.348 --> 27:33.251
-There's this woman over
in Sarah Jane's house!
-Who's Sarah Jane?

27:33.318 --> 27:35.420
-SARAH JANE:
Maria, please help me!
-Dad!

27:35.487 --> 27:38.957
-Get out of my house!
-This isn't your house!

27:39.024 --> 27:40.592
Who are you?

27:41.426 --> 27:42.861
What about Maria?

27:44.129 --> 27:45.663
EERIE VOICE:
Remember...
