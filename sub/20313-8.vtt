08:35.682 --> 08:36.850
Here's what we'll do.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.227
Seven percent,
one Phys Ed class.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.854
We're really going
to miss you around here.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.647
-You're going to what?
-I better post your position.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.359
Post my what? Sir?

08:46.693 --> 08:48.945
[rock music playing]

08:48.945 --> 08:50.613
Hey, Bobbi,
did you hear the news?

08:50.613 --> 08:52.407
No, what news?

08:52.407 --> 08:54.451
Looks like I'm going
to be teaching Phys Ed

08:54.451 --> 08:55.869
at St. Pat's next year.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.413
Oh, well, congratulations,
Gerry. Good.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.707
Yeah, I know
you probably feel bad

09:00.707 --> 09:02.334
'cause this is ah...

09:02.334 --> 09:03.960
kinda your fault
that I'm leaving.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.586
What are you talking about?

09:05.586 --> 09:08.340
Well, if you'd have offered me
a Phys Ed position here,

09:08.340 --> 09:09.883
I could have stayed.

09:09.883 --> 09:13.053
We don't have a position
available, Gerry. Okay?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.095
Well...

09:15.638 --> 09:18.058
I haven't accepted
the job there yet.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.018
So, if you want to offer me
a Phys Ed position...

09:20.018 --> 09:21.228
I will stay.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.063
You should accept
that immediately.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.983
Because we still don't have
a position available, okay?

09:26.983 --> 09:29.403
I'm gonna grab it, so...done.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.446
See ya, good knowing ya.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.285
Hey, Simon.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.453
Hey, Gerry.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.288
Boy, we had some
good times here.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.250
Oh, yeah, good times.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.253
Looks like I'm going to be going
to St. Pat's next year.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.423
Really?! That is great news.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.174
-What?
-That means you and me

09:51.174 --> 09:52.592
can finally start hanging out.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.094
-We can what?
-Yup,

09:54.094 --> 09:55.970
I knew this day
would come sooner or later.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.764
You're always saying we spend
too much time here in school.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.182
We don't need to hang
out afterwards.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.600
-I said that?
-But guess who just became

10:00.600 --> 10:03.395
nighttime buddies?
You and me Pal.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.604
I don't know
if you're listening,

10:04.604 --> 10:06.565
but I'm not gonna be here.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.775
Oh, the things we'll do.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.486
Gerry, we're going to set
this town on fire.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.614
If you really, really,
really wanted me to stay...

10:14.614 --> 10:16.116
I don't want you to stay.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.285
I want you as far away
from me as possible Gerry.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.287
So I can rope you back in
on weeknights.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.871
You know what it's going to
be like? It's gonna be like

10:21.871 --> 10:23.582
that time we accidentally went
to that gay bar.

10:23.582 --> 10:27.377
Except we can do it every night.
And not by accident.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.547
Yeah. September 5th, book it.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.549
We're hanging out.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.426
Doesn't have to be a gay bar.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.929
Well, that backfired.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.682
Whatcha doing?

10:41.682 --> 10:44.644
Oh, I'm just taking a little
mental break. You know?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.313
I took one of those once.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.356
Best two years of my life.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.066
I take it you're here
to apologize

10:50.066 --> 10:51.568
for ruining my song.

10:51.568 --> 10:55.029
You always make such
an ordeal out of everything.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.532
God, why do you know me so well?

10:57.532 --> 10:59.742
You're right.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.287
Are these the lyrics?

11:02.287 --> 11:03.955
They're good.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.540
They're stupid.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.292
It's just a song, Robert.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.544
Yeah? That's what I thought too.

11:09.544 --> 11:10.462
You know what? Maybe it's time

11:10.462 --> 11:11.671
I just accept the fact

11:11.671 --> 11:13.756
that I'll never be Callaghan.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.758
I'm not principal material.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.344
Now, if you'll excuse me,

11:17.344 --> 11:20.013
I'd like to get back
to my mental break.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.890
Okay, you take all
the time you need.

11:28.563 --> 11:29.981
[Lisa] Hey, Gerry.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.025
-Hey.
-Hey, um, I heard about

11:32.025 --> 11:33.568
your new job at St. Pat's.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.820
And, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.573
I haven't even accepted the
position, who keeps saying this?

11:38.573 --> 11:41.535
-Oh, Callaghan posted your job.
-He pos...

11:41.535 --> 11:44.120
he posted my...

11:44.120 --> 11:46.164
I just spoke to him like...

11:46.164 --> 11:49.083
-Well, these are for you.
-Oh, are they from everybody?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.293
No, just me.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.462
I kind feel like
we're allies here.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.297
You know, since we started
at the same time.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.633
You probably should have told
people you were doing this.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.510
Okay, well, I didn't.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.595
But I'm saying they may have
wanted to go in on this

12:00.595 --> 12:02.222
with you, for a bigger gift.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.684
Anyway, um, it sounds like
the perfect position for you.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.310
I'm more worried about you.
That they're gonna be

12:07.310 --> 12:09.312
annoyed with you,
for doing this on your own.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.523
-Gerry, it's...
-I'm just saying, you know?

12:11.523 --> 12:13.774
You look like the hero.
You get the gift,

12:13.774 --> 12:16.570
they didn't have a chance
to get something together.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.573
-Right?
-Okay, Gerry.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.865
Have a good day.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.829
Here you go. To your new job,

12:26.829 --> 12:28.164
bigger and better things.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.166
Bill, I haven't accepted
the position yet.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.252
Why not? This is the Phys Ed
job you've always wanted.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.712
And until they get to know you,
the new students

12:33.712 --> 12:36.089
-will respect you.
-What are you talking about?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.840
You don't know anything
about what they think.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.925
All right?

12:38.925 --> 12:39.926
-Here's comment cards.
-Oh.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.219
Yeah, oh.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.845
"Not the worst teacher
I've ever had."

12:42.845 --> 12:44.222
Thank you. Goes there.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.557
Yeah, quite respectful.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.642
"Gives us a lot
of free time during class

12:47.642 --> 12:48.976
and shows a lot
of great movies.

12:48.976 --> 12:49.894
Thank you sir."

12:49.894 --> 12:52.021
You are welcome.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.065
"Has a lot
of great golf shirts".

12:54.065 --> 12:56.025
-Quality feedback.
-Compliment accepted.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.569
Yeah "Mr. D is always late."

12:57.569 --> 12:59.279
Not always,
but that can go over there.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.656
"Mr. D takes too long
to hand assignments back."

13:01.656 --> 13:03.658
Not even true, liars.
In that pile.

13:03.658 --> 13:06.119
Yeah, "Mr. D takes the whole
class taking attendance."

13:06.119 --> 13:07.786
That's um...

13:07.786 --> 13:10.123
okay, so those
are the negative ones

13:10.123 --> 13:11.541
and then what I do...

13:11.541 --> 13:12.667
A little trick.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.043
I told them it was anonymous.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.170
-So their names aren't on these.
-Right.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.047
But I take a previous assignment

13:18.047 --> 13:19.549
and I match up their writing.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.135
Find out who said
the bad things, message them.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.554
-Say, I never liked you anyway.
-Yeah.

13:24.554 --> 13:27.766
-A little payback.
-Wow, that is...professional.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.808
Wow. Do any of the comment
cards say, you're crazy?

13:29.808 --> 13:33.772
-No.
-Oh, probably should.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.814
I don't know why this is such
a hard decision for you, man.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.526
-This is your dream job.
-Why is it a hard decision?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.027
It is a dream job.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.613
But then I think of these kids.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.490
Yeah, but there's
more of these kids.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.907
I don't know if there's
more of them, but I...

13:44.907 --> 13:46.326
There is, it's like 70/30.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.952
I gotta do what's
right for me, right?

13:47.952 --> 13:49.162
I want to teach Phys Ed.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.871
Yeah, you want
to teach Phys Ed man.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.831
I'm going to take it.
I think I'm gonna take it.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.208
-Yeah?
-Phys Ed!

13:54.208 --> 13:56.419
-Phys Ed!
-To my new job at St. Pat's.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.337
-Boom!
-To your new job.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.006
-Boom.
-New kids!

14:00.006 --> 14:01.800
-Mmmhmm.
-Agh!

14:07.722 --> 14:10.016
All right, have a good summer.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.601
-Bye.
-Bye, sir.

14:11.601 --> 14:15.355
Just bye? Bye forever, maybe.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.442
I'm sitting here,
if anyone wants to...

14:19.442 --> 14:22.111
okay, bye it is.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.405
Last chance to...

14:25.031 --> 14:26.866
say something.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.159
Hey, sir.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.243
Hey.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.953
I almost forgot.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.624
This is from the class.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.292
From the class?

14:36.292 --> 14:39.295
Anyway, have a good summer.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.548
You have a good summer too.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.966
From the class.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.220
Thank you! Shut up, you guys.

I was actually
starting to question

16:09.218 --> 16:10.845
my abilities as a leader.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.221
And now I realize,

16:12.221 --> 16:13.848
the only thing I should
have been questioning

16:13.848 --> 16:15.892
the entire time...

16:15.892 --> 16:18.352
was your musical ability.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.730
Oh man. What was that?

16:20.730 --> 16:23.357
I can do the time Robert.

16:23.357 --> 16:27.111
Paul, out of you I would
have expected more.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.196
Oh, man.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.157
Agh.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.494
[Maya] We've laughed together,
we've cried together

16:34.494 --> 16:36.579
and we've fallen asleep
in class together.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.038
[everyone laughs]

16:38.038 --> 16:39.707
Xavier is more than a school.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.709
It's more than books and tests.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.378
It's home. It's family.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.588
And there is no better example

16:45.588 --> 16:47.590
of that family
than our teachers.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.592
-Here we go.
-[Leung] Shhhh.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.886
-[Maya] We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for them.
-Teachers, not you.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.262
I'd like to thank the teachers

16:53.262 --> 16:55.765
who made my senior year
especially memorable.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.433
Ms. Galka, Mr. Hunt,

16:57.433 --> 16:58.977
Mr. Duncan and Ms. Mason.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.854
I believe it was
Bobby Kennedy who once said,

17:00.854 --> 17:02.438
only those who dare
to fail greatly,

17:02.438 --> 17:04.064
can achieve greatly.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.233
I believe it's important to take
the words of Bobby Kennedy

17:06.233 --> 17:08.027
as we move onto university.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.070
It's important to...

17:12.448 --> 17:14.116
[whispers]
Sir, what are you doing?

17:15.952 --> 17:19.873
You're one
of my favorites too, thank you.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.499
I'm gonna let you finish, okay?

17:21.499 --> 17:24.002
-No, I'm not...
-I just need to say something.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.712
It's really important.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.758
Hello, I'm Mr. D.

17:30.758 --> 17:34.012
A lot of what Maya said there,

17:34.012 --> 17:36.973
was about me.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.307
Inspired by me.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.976
Sometimes we forget,
as teachers,

17:39.976 --> 17:43.145
how important our role is in...

17:43.145 --> 17:44.438
in all of this.

17:44.438 --> 17:48.150
But speeches like Maya's, and...

17:48.150 --> 17:51.111
thank you cards.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.823
Remind us that, students...

17:53.823 --> 17:56.075
are not the future...

17:56.075 --> 17:57.577
teachers are.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.955
And even though, Mr. Callaghan's

18:00.955 --> 18:03.123
ex-girlfriend tried to...

18:03.123 --> 18:06.419
steal me away from this place,

18:06.419 --> 18:07.754
don't worry sir,

18:07.754 --> 18:09.797
she was unsuccessful.

18:09.797 --> 18:13.259
But hot...hot.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.344
So, with that said,

18:15.344 --> 18:18.014
I've decided to stay
at Xavier Academy.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.975
And I do want to thank
my colleagues who...

18:20.975 --> 18:23.561
in their own little way said,

18:23.561 --> 18:26.230
"Don't go, don't go."

18:26.230 --> 18:30.276
And to the students
who said thank you.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.195
Thank you.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.990
Thank you.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.618
All right, Maya,
as you were. Finish up.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.620
I'm finished now.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.831
I'm finished now.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.083
Maybe the worst ending

18:45.083 --> 18:48.795
to a valedictorian speech
I've heard.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.547
How about a hand
for Maya Garland everybody? Yes.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.674
[everyone claps]

18:54.801 --> 18:56.928
Come on.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.305
[everyone claps]

19:03.684 --> 19:06.104
[clapping continues]

19:10.024 --> 19:13.360
Oh! Senior prank.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.279
Still not the best though.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.614
They ruin my handlebars.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.241
Wow, they must have
it in for ya.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.827
What'd you do to piss them off?

19:26.290 --> 19:27.834
You tell me.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.336
What? My car.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.381
They must really
want me to stay.

19:34.381 --> 19:37.927
After I turn mine over,
I'll flip yours.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.345
What?

19:40.805 --> 19:43.891
[rock music playing]

19:46.644 --> 19:49.856
Mr...Duncan it says here?
Correct?

19:49.856 --> 19:52.984
Are you being serious?
Like this is ridiculous.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.402
Once a job has been posted,

19:55.402 --> 19:57.279
an interview is mandatory.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.073
So...

19:59.073 --> 20:00.783
Okay, interview me.

20:00.783 --> 20:04.495
What would you say
are your strengths?

20:04.495 --> 20:07.581
Ah, kids love me,
I'm a good motivator.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.125
And how about weaknesses?

20:09.125 --> 20:13.004
Ah, right now my triceps
and my quads are a little weak.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.048
-Oh, you're joking?
-Yeah.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.508
I wonder if any
of the other nine candidates

20:17.508 --> 20:19.301
who I'm interviewing
for that job today

20:19.301 --> 20:20.761
would find it as funny.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.680
Are you being serious?
This is a real interview?

20:22.680 --> 20:25.265
Very. Where were we?

20:25.265 --> 20:27.727
Oh, right. Weaknesses!

20:30.270 --> 20:31.522
Sometimes I hand tests back

20:31.522 --> 20:34.441
a little late, so what?

20:34.441 --> 20:35.902
You don't need
to write that down.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.362
Yeah, um...

20:38.362 --> 20:39.822
delayed test results

20:39.822 --> 20:41.657
can impede a childs progress.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.701
And delay educational
development.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.828
It's bad.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.121
What's going on?

20:47.121 --> 20:50.249
I have to be interviewed
for my own job again?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.709
Seriously?

20:51.709 --> 20:53.961
You know, technically
the job's still his.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.254
[Gerry] What?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.506
Yeah, yes it is.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.466
Well, then, what's this?

20:59.466 --> 21:02.095
Oh, this is me having fun.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.138
That does sound like fun.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.102
Weaknesses include...

21:09.102 --> 21:11.020
gullibility.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.439
Do you know, that word's
not even in the dictionary?

21:13.439 --> 21:14.732
I'll see ya next year.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.735

awesome, awesome ♪
