WEBVTT

00:50.092 --> 00:51.135
Shh!

01:40.476 --> 01:44.105
- Sure is a groovy day for a beach party.
- I'II say.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.607
Shag, how you coming
with the surf fishing?

01:46.774 --> 01:49.568
Not even a nibble.
Scooby, have you had any luck yet?

01:49.735 --> 01:51.988
You bet.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.907
Hot dogs? Where did you catch them?

01:55.074 --> 01:57.243
Watch.

01:58.536 --> 02:01.080
Hey, that's our lunch basket.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.084
Now, why didn't I think of that?

02:10.715 --> 02:13.426
Scooby, that was, like,
the one that got away.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.428
Very funny.

02:15.594 --> 02:19.098
- Come on, Shag. Let's dance.
- Just one more cast.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.767
I got a feeling
I'II catch something this time.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.937
- Using a toy mouse for bait?
- Sure.

02:26.439 --> 02:29.608
- What better way to catch a catfish?
- It figures.

02:29.775 --> 02:33.154
Hey, I must have, like,
hooked Moby Dick.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.780
Give me a hand, Scoob.

02:39.452 --> 02:42.955
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
It must weigh a ton.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.669
Zoinks! What's that?

02:48.794 --> 02:49.920
That?

02:55.009 --> 02:58.137
Wow. It's a caveman frozen in ice.

02:58.304 --> 03:00.806
I wonder where this frozen fright
floated in from.

03:00.973 --> 03:03.559
I know. I read about it in the paper.

03:03.726 --> 03:07.480
Scientists found this 2-million-year-old
caveman in the Arctic.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.608
A research vessel was taking him
to Oceanland...

03:10.775 --> 03:13.486
when he was lost overboard
during a storm at sea.

03:13.652 --> 03:16.822
Am I glad he's frozen in there
and that we're out here.

03:16.989 --> 03:20.659
He won't stay frozen for long.
We've got to get him to Oceanland...

03:20.826 --> 03:23.954
so scientists can put him
in the cooler before he melts.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.664
Melts?

03:28.417 --> 03:30.252
So we didn't waste any time...

03:30.419 --> 03:33.172
bringing the caveman here
to Oceanland, professor.

03:33.339 --> 03:35.633
Professor Ingstrom and I
wish to thank you...

03:35.800 --> 03:38.177
for rushing our frozen friend to us.

03:38.344 --> 03:41.055
- You're welcome.
- We're glad to get rid of him.

03:41.263 --> 03:45.768
What would have happened if I hadn't
hooked that prehistoric ice cube?

03:45.935 --> 03:50.272
With the prevailing current, it would've
drifted down to Oceanland anyhow.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.942
Shouldn't you put him in a refrigerator?

03:53.109 --> 03:56.779
Yes, yes. We'll store him in the
Arctic room. It's very cold in there.

03:56.946 --> 03:59.240
Wouldn't it be
an amazing achievement...

03:59.407 --> 04:02.118
if we could bring the caveman
back to life?

04:02.284 --> 04:04.912
If you don't mind,
we like him just the way he is.

04:05.079 --> 04:07.456
Well, we got to be going.
Come on, Scoob.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.543
- Let's 90.
- Coming.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.424
Sorry, madam.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.470
Hey. Wait for me.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.277
It's getting late,
Professor Wayne. Are you coming?

04:36.444 --> 04:38.154
No, Professor Ingstrom.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.657
I still have some work to do on
these notes on Arctic plankton.

04:41.824 --> 04:45.286
Very well. I'm going
down to the dock. I have some...

04:45.453 --> 04:48.164
Some research to do.

05:00.718 --> 05:04.138
- Boy, was that good.
- You bet.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.140
Isn't there anything more to eat?

05:06.307 --> 05:08.851
Just two slices of bread
and an old ice cube.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.145
- I'II take it.
- Speaking of ice cubes...

05:11.312 --> 05:13.522
I wonder how our frozen friend
is doing.

05:13.689 --> 05:18.027
Zoinks. I just remembered,
I left my rod and reel at Oceanland.

05:18.194 --> 05:20.274
Well, it's not too late.
We'll drive back and get it.

05:25.784 --> 05:29.163
Wow. This place is spooky at night.

05:30.873 --> 05:35.002
- Professor Wayne? Professor Ingstrom?
- They must've gone home for the night.

05:35.169 --> 05:38.172
- We'll have to come back tomorrow.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.341
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

05:40.508 --> 05:44.178
- Get a load of this door.
- It's been ripped right off its hinges.

05:44.637 --> 05:48.474
It looks like somebody or something
was in a big hurry to get out.

05:48.641 --> 05:51.185
- But what?
- There's only one way to find out.

05:51.477 --> 05:54.522
Yeah. We'll go home and read about it
in tomorrow's paper.

05:54.897 --> 05:58.400
That's not what I had in mind, Shaggy.
Come on.

06:00.110 --> 06:04.281
Jumping jellybeans. It looks like
this room's been hit by a cyclone.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.827
Hey, look. Professor Wayne's fur parka.

06:08.994 --> 06:12.831
- It's been torn up.
- But where's Professor Wayne?

06:12.998 --> 06:16.710
What I want to know is,
where is the caveman?

06:16.877 --> 06:17.920
Look.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.338
He's gone.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.382
But that's impossible.

06:21.966 --> 06:26.554
- Not if he came to life, it isn't.
- That does it. I'm calling the sheriff.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.558
- Got to get the sheriff.
- Shaggy.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.269
Broken. Shaggy?

06:33.435 --> 06:35.896
Don't bother me now, Scoob.

06:38.315 --> 06:42.236
Hello, sheriff? Hello? Hello?

06:42.403 --> 06:45.698
This phone's busted.
Why didn't you say something, Scoob?

06:45.864 --> 06:47.199
Oh, boy.

06:47.533 --> 06:50.494
There's something peculiar
about this block of ice...

06:50.661 --> 06:52.246
melting in the Arctic room.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.374
Maybe this heater explains why.
It's been turned on.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.919
But why would anyone want to
bring that creep to life?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.589
I don't know, but we're
gonna find out.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.883
Hey, look. Footprints.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.929
And, like, look at the size
of them. Extra-large caveman.

07:09.096 --> 07:13.559
We're in luck. We can follow them
right to him. Can't you, Scooby?

07:15.185 --> 07:17.896
- I can?
- You heard the lady. Let's go.

07:20.566 --> 07:23.694
I've heard of holding
someone's hand when they're scared...

07:23.902 --> 07:25.904
but this is ridiculous.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.702
Look. The footprints end
at the edge of the dock.

07:31.869 --> 07:35.914
And take a look who's out
on the dock. Professor Ingstrom.

07:36.081 --> 07:39.251
What's he doing
with that strange equipment?

07:48.093 --> 07:51.764
This scene is getting creepier
by the minute.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.602
Is he talking to the fish,
or am I dreaming?

08:00.606 --> 08:02.608
You're not dreaming, I don't think.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.945
Scooby, sneak up closer and see
if you can tell what he's up to.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.865
- Me?
- Like, you're the only Scooby here...

08:10.032 --> 08:11.283
thank goodness.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.553
So far, so good.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.981
Who's there?

08:43.440 --> 08:45.651
That must have been the wind.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.242
Scoob, look out for those pails!

09:04.044 --> 09:06.588
Scooby, are you all right?

09:06.839 --> 09:07.965
Uh-huh.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.968
Professor Ingstrom
sure acted suspiciously.

09:11.135 --> 09:14.805
- I'II bet he's up to something.
- And it's our job to find out what.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.390
Come on.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.351
Let's take a look in that shack.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.644
Shh!

09:24.815 --> 09:28.235
- It's the caveman!
- Let's get out of here!

09:29.653 --> 09:32.740
Faster, Velma! Faster!

09:36.827 --> 09:38.203
Zoinks. We're goners.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.294
Let's, like, find someplace to hide.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.350
Phew.

10:00.559 --> 10:03.729
- Boy, was that close.
- Too close.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.940
Come on. We better see what happened
to Shag and Scoob.

10:14.323 --> 10:15.365
Aha!

10:39.515 --> 10:42.059
Zoinks. Now you really got him mad.

10:54.446 --> 10:58.408
Gosh. We've looked almost everywhere,
but still no sign of Shaggy and Scooby.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.745
- I hope big-and-ugly didn't find them.
- Not a chance.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.705
If I know those two chickens...

11:03.872 --> 11:06.583
they're miles away
from the caveman by now.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.902
Zoinks!

11:41.618 --> 11:46.123
Well, like, I always wanted to
take a spin around Oceanland.

11:46.290 --> 11:50.961
- Look.
- We've landed on the tail of a whale.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.297
Still no sign of Shag and Scooby.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.132
Correction. Here they come!

11:55.299 --> 11:56.967
Help!

11:57.217 --> 11:58.719
And there they go.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.013
Like, help!

12:02.639 --> 12:05.809
Shaggy, Scooby, are you all right?

12:05.976 --> 12:09.187
Yeah, but now I know how
a baseball feels...

12:09.354 --> 12:11.481
when it's knocked out of the park.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.358
Me too.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.613
This whole mystery's got me puzzled.

12:17.779 --> 12:21.074
First Professor Wayne vanishes,
then Ingstrom disappears...

12:21.241 --> 12:24.077
and finally, that frozen fright
appears big as life.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.414
I bet Ingstrom and his machine
had something to do with it.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.751
Maybe this clue I found
will give us some answers.

12:31.043 --> 12:34.504
- Like, what is it?
- An ocean chart. And look.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.424
This line drawn
from the spot marked X...

12:37.591 --> 12:40.636
follows the current right to Oceanland.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.012
She's right.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.973
Our next step is to find out
what's out there.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.144
You mean, like, you're going out there
where X marks the spot?

12:49.311 --> 12:52.022
Wrong. You're going out there
with Velma and Scooby.

12:52.189 --> 12:55.817
Daphne and I will try
and find out what the caveman's up to.

13:01.740 --> 13:06.870
Shaggy, steer three degrees to starboard
and then seven degrees to port.

13:07.037 --> 13:11.416
I'm nervous enough. Just simple
"turn left" or "turn right" will do.

13:11.792 --> 13:16.380
We should just about be there.
Keep a sharp lookout, Scooby.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.424
Look. Look. Dead ahead.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.426
A spooky old fishing boat.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.930
And it's anchored Where
the X is marked on the Chart.

13:26.348 --> 13:30.352
It seems to be deserted. This is
our Chance to search for clues.

13:30.686 --> 13:34.523
Oh, boy. With our luck,
we'll probably find a ghost crew.

13:35.107 --> 13:38.110
Hmm. Nothing in there.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.612
Hmm.
Yipes!

13:44.658 --> 13:47.869
- A horrible creature?
- Oh, Scooby, it's only me.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.247
Now, come inside,
and let's look around.

13:51.873 --> 13:56.378
- What kind of clues are we looking for?
- Anything unusual or mysterious.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.425
You mean, like doors slamming
and locking behind us? Yikes!

14:01.591 --> 14:05.220
What am I saying? It did slam
and did look, and we're trapped.

14:05.679 --> 14:09.683
And that's not all.
Look. An ice machine.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.227
And somebody turned it on full blast.

14:12.561 --> 14:16.648
Hey, wait a minute. This is a Clue.
The caveman was frozen in ice.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.401
We're gonna be next
if we don't get out of here.

14:19.818 --> 14:23.113
We haven't much time. Somebody
better think of something fast.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.073
Here's a Scooby Snack, Scoob.

14:26.825 --> 14:27.951
Think of something.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.786
Aha!

14:30.120 --> 14:34.791
- What's he doing with those ice tongs?
- I don't know, but give him room.

14:34.958 --> 14:39.421
Wow. He's gonna build up speed and
ram the door with the block of ice.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.089
Go, Scooby. Go.

14:41.465 --> 14:45.761
- Look out, Scoob!
- Oh, no. He's losing control.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.055
Whoa!

14:49.723 --> 14:54.269
That ice hit the keyhole so hard it was
forced through in the shape of a key.

14:54.436 --> 14:57.606
- See if you can reach it, Scooby.
- And, like, hurry.

14:57.773 --> 14:58.815
Okay.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.443
Hurry, Scooby. The ice is piling up.

15:01.943 --> 15:05.030
Hurry, Scoob. Hurry!

15:07.115 --> 15:08.492
Lucky that key worked.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.870
And just in time. Come on.
Let's go back to Oceanland...

15:12.037 --> 15:15.624
- and tell the others what we found.
- I'm for that.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.836
Whoever locked us in the cabin wants
to be double sure we don't get ashore.

15:20.003 --> 15:23.673
But don't worry. I've got a hot idea.

15:25.300 --> 15:29.137
- You call this a hot idea?
- Keep paddling, Shaggy.

15:29.304 --> 15:34.267
- This is no time to get cold feet.
- It's not cold feet I'm worrying about.

15:38.146 --> 15:42.609
Well, we have pieces to this puzzle,
but we don't know how they fit together.

15:42.776 --> 15:47.447
I figure the only way to figure out this
mystery is to capture the caveman.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.951
I figured that's what she'd figure.

15:52.494 --> 15:55.747
Now, here's my plan, Shaggy.
All you and Scooby have to do...

15:55.914 --> 15:59.376
is find the caveman and let him
chase you through that doorway.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.295
And when you do,
we simply drop the net on him.

16:02.546 --> 16:05.340
Like, what safer way to sneak up
on an old gruesome...

16:05.507 --> 16:07.509
than disguised as a couple of fish?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.643
Zoinks. Hold it.

16:16.935 --> 16:20.147
There he is now.
Okay, Scoob, do your stuff.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.982
Here goes.

16:22.774 --> 16:23.817
Yipe!

16:24.818 --> 16:27.028
Bull's-eye!

16:31.658 --> 16:35.370
Feet-I mean fins, let's go.

16:36.872 --> 16:40.667
- Zoinks. He's gaining on us.
- Help! Help!

16:40.834 --> 16:42.586
I think I hear them coming.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.630
Daphne, don't lean over so far.

16:45.839 --> 16:49.843
- Help!
- Help!

16:51.136 --> 16:55.348
- Hey, like, what happened?
- Danger-prone Daphne did it again.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.352
Oh, no. Here comes trouble.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.105
Let's get out of here.

17:45.106 --> 17:46.149
Ahh!

19:04.436 --> 19:06.604
Someone get me out of here!

19:06.771 --> 19:08.732
Hey, like, he can talk.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.776
Let's pull him out, Shag,
and see who he really is.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.571
All together, pull.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.036
It's Professor Wayne.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.583
You mean to say this whole
caveman thing was a hoax?

19:26.750 --> 19:27.959
Not entirely, sheriff.

19:28.126 --> 19:31.463
The 2-million-year-old caveman
lost at sea was for real.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.799
And that's what gave
Professor Wayne the idea for his scheme.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.594
First he froze the dummy
caveman in a block of ice

19:37.761 --> 19:39.137
out at the old fishing boat.

19:39.304 --> 19:42.265
<i>He set it adrift,
knowing it would float to Oceanland.</i>

19:42.432 --> 19:45.143
<i>Then he melted the ice
with an electric heater...</i>

19:45.310 --> 19:47.687
<i>and made it appear the caveman
came to life...</i>

19:47.854 --> 19:49.981
<i>and caused he and Ingstrom
to vanish.</i>

19:50.148 --> 19:53.526
Once Ingstrom was
out of the way, Wayne would return...

19:53.693 --> 19:56.488
claiming to have escaped
from the caveman.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.490
But Why did he do it?

19:58.656 --> 20:01.493
I can answer that.
He was after my invention.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.037
A revolutionary marine-life
communicator.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.915
Like, wow. You mean
you can talk to fish with it?

20:07.082 --> 20:08.666
Scooby-Doo.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.835
Scooby-Doo.

20:11.002 --> 20:14.005
Scooby-Doo.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.509
That invention is worth a fortune.

20:17.675 --> 20:21.012
It would have been mine if it
weren't for those meddling kids.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.139
Well, where you're going...

20:23.306 --> 20:26.893
you won't have to worry about
meddling kids anymore.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.230
That wraps up this mystery.
Let's head for the malt shop.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.400
What are we gonna do
with old, tall, dark and dummy?

20:33.566 --> 20:36.194
- Like, I got an idea.
- Huh?

20:38.947 --> 20:41.533
That was a Clever idea you had, Shaggy.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.327
Yeah, like, Scoob needed
a dance partner...

20:44.494 --> 20:46.955
and he couldn't
have gotten a better one.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.374
I gotta admit, Scoob has style.

20:49.541 --> 20:52.961
Yeah. He's all over the floor.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.181
Shh!
