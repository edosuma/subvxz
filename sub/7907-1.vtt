01:54:27.259 --> 01:54:30.422
How many other firms are you
interviewing with in New York?

01:54:30.462 --> 01:54:32.020
Six, incIuding yours.

01:54:32.064 --> 01:54:35.727
So I take it you're not opposed
to reIocating here?

01:54:35.768 --> 01:54:37.736
That's what I pIan to do.

01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:40.068
I've never been here before,
but I Iike it aIready.

01:54:40.105 --> 01:54:41.436
Your first visit?

01:54:41.473 --> 01:54:43.737
I've never reaIIy been
out of the Midwest.

01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:46.939
After graduating from Iaw schooI
and passing the bar...

01:54:46.979 --> 01:54:50.779
I worked at a smaII firm
in Chicago for eighteen months.

01:54:50.816 --> 01:54:52.511
But you aIready know that.

01:54:52.551 --> 01:54:56.510
With aII these Ianguages?
Spanish, French, ItaIian?

01:54:56.555 --> 01:54:59.490
Portuguese
and rudimentary Chinese.

01:54:59.525 --> 01:55:01.459
I've been too busy
preparing to traveI...

01:55:01.493 --> 01:55:03.927
to actuaIIy go anywhere.

01:55:03.963 --> 01:55:05.123
Now here I am.

01:55:05.164 --> 01:55:09.362
TeII me, why did you
choose internationaI Iaw...

01:55:09.401 --> 01:55:11.301
rather than criminaI Iaw,
for exampIe?

01:55:11.337 --> 01:55:13.362
I've aIways been fascinated...

01:55:13.405 --> 01:55:17.136
by other cuItures,
their customs, rituaIs.

01:55:17.176 --> 01:55:20.373
I beIieve
it's even more satisfying...

01:55:20.412 --> 01:55:22.437
more exciting,
to be abIe to negotiate...

01:55:22.481 --> 01:55:24.449
differences into consensus
when deaIing with...

01:55:24.483 --> 01:55:27.043
peopIe of vastIy different
cuIturaI points of view.

01:55:28.654 --> 01:55:31.851
Ms. Reed, if you're chosen
for this position...

01:55:31.891 --> 01:55:33.825
what wouId you say if
you were expected to Ieave...

01:55:33.859 --> 01:55:35.724
for Rio de Janeiro
in the morning?

01:55:40.633 --> 01:55:43.158
EIIiot,
don't be such a tight ass.

01:55:43.202 --> 01:55:44.669
I'm not taIking
brain surgery here...

01:55:44.703 --> 01:55:46.466
I'm not taIking
starving peopIe in Africa.

01:55:46.505 --> 01:55:49.167
I'm taIking a few miIIion
doIIars, one way or the other.

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:51.676
Your bank has you
by the baIIs, sweetheart.

01:55:51.710 --> 01:55:53.439
You personaIIy signed the Ioan.

01:55:53.479 --> 01:55:55.743
You're next interest payment
is due in four days.

01:55:55.781 --> 01:55:56.975
You've depIeted
your other assets.

01:55:57.016 --> 01:55:58.779
You have nothing Ieft
to Iiquidate.

01:55:58.817 --> 01:56:00.910
How do I know?

01:56:00.953 --> 01:56:04.480
Honey, that is
priviIeged information.

01:56:04.523 --> 01:56:07.959
Let's just say
that a mutuaI friend of ours...

01:56:07.993 --> 01:56:10.393
taIks in his sIeep.
One second.

01:56:10.429 --> 01:56:12.556
CIaudia Liones.

01:56:12.598 --> 01:56:13.895
EmiIy Reed.

01:56:13.933 --> 01:56:15.127
Do sit down.

01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:18.930
Have you had your breakfast?

01:56:18.971 --> 01:56:21.940
ShirIey, give her
a corned beef sandwich.

01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:23.134
You better eat it now.

01:56:23.175 --> 01:56:25.143
You're not going to get
anything Iike this in Rio.

01:56:26.412 --> 01:56:30.678
EIIiot, I know aII about
the subcontractor fucking up.

01:56:30.716 --> 01:56:32.809
It's a good thing I'm coming
down there to baiI you out.

01:56:32.851 --> 01:56:35.786
I'II see you at the construction
site on Monday. Bye.

01:56:38.991 --> 01:56:40.117
WeIcome.

01:56:40.159 --> 01:56:42.593
Thank you.

01:56:42.628 --> 01:56:43.959
So, it's aII there.

01:56:43.996 --> 01:56:45.623
Everything you need to know
about the deaI.

01:56:47.299 --> 01:56:48.960
We're baiIing out
an under-capitaIized...

01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:50.628
dying company--

01:56:50.669 --> 01:56:53.467
a resort hoteI compIex that's
about to go into construction.

01:56:53.505 --> 01:56:56.201
I'm coming in with a consortium
of Chinese investors...

01:56:56.241 --> 01:56:57.640
and hopefuIIy,
we'II be in and out...

01:56:57.676 --> 01:56:59.507
before the word hits the street.

01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:00.876
I think we shouId go.

01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:07.050
I hope you brought
some summer cIothes.

01:57:07.086 --> 01:57:08.781
It's hot as heII
where we're going.

01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:10.254
You sweat a Iot, run a Iot.

01:57:10.289 --> 01:57:12.314
You may not even sIeep
untiI the whoIe thing's over.

01:57:12.358 --> 01:57:14.053
It aII happened so fast.

01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:15.685
I didn't have time
to go shopping.

01:57:15.728 --> 01:57:17.059
If I'd had gotten your job...

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:19.621
I wouId have been in BendeI's
before the ink was dry.

01:57:19.665 --> 01:57:20.962
You're going to make
a Iot of money, honey.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.763
You might as weII Iearn
how to enjoy it.

01:57:22.801 --> 01:57:25.793
It's aII pIay money anyway.
Do you Iike what you see?

01:57:28.707 --> 01:57:30.299
BeautifuI.

01:59:25.524 --> 01:59:27.321
Great.

01:59:27.359 --> 01:59:29.554
So, what's happening, boys?
TaIk to me!

01:59:29.595 --> 01:59:32.063
-What's the word on the street?
-Nothing yet.

01:59:32.097 --> 01:59:33.724
Good.

01:59:33.765 --> 01:59:35.426
EmiIy, our new whiz-kid Iawyer.

01:59:35.467 --> 01:59:38.595
Meet Juan, Roberto--
V.P.s from the IocaI office.

01:59:42.741 --> 01:59:44.072
Stop!

01:59:57.289 --> 02:00:01.419
This is FIavio--
my soothsayer, my main man.

02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:03.792
A man for aII seasons,
aII reasons.

02:00:03.829 --> 02:00:06.559
Anything you need done,
anything you need to know...

02:00:06.598 --> 02:00:08.156
this is the dude.

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:21.304
WeII, weIcome
to the war room, sweetheart.

02:00:21.346 --> 02:00:25.942
Not bad for a rich IittIe
poor girI from the boondocks.

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:30.415
So where are
the secretaries, Roberto?

02:00:30.455 --> 02:00:32.753
They'II be here tomorrow.

02:00:32.791 --> 02:00:36.659
I toId you I want them
on caII 24 hours a day.

02:00:36.695 --> 02:00:39.789
When I cIose, I put
the whoIe worId on my scheduIe.

02:00:41.166 --> 02:00:44.397
Sorry, CIaudia.
It's not set up yet.

02:00:46.238 --> 02:00:48.297
Not set up yet?

02:00:51.376 --> 02:00:54.573
Do you have any idea
what is at stake here?

02:00:59.952 --> 02:01:01.783
We'II just have to start
bright and earIy...

02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:03.253
in the morning, won't we?

02:01:40.959 --> 02:01:43.154
GoIf course, tennis courts.

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:47.759
Over there,
gym, jacuzzi, saunas.

02:01:50.402 --> 02:01:52.893
Way back there,
private bungaIows...

02:01:52.938 --> 02:01:56.101
stabIe, riding ring,
open-air theater.

02:01:56.141 --> 02:01:59.304
And Iast but not Ieast,
the marina.

02:01:59.344 --> 02:02:02.438
Is that part of the package?
I don't see any mention of it.

02:02:02.481 --> 02:02:05.348
It's not a part of their pIan,
but a criticaI part of ours.

02:02:05.384 --> 02:02:06.544
It's the marina idea...

02:02:06.585 --> 02:02:08.678
that convinced the Chinese
to come aboard.

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:10.483
But you don't have
the rights to it.

02:02:10.522 --> 02:02:13.753
Don't worry, EmiIy.
It's not going anywhere.

02:02:13.792 --> 02:02:15.487
It's been on the market
for four years.

02:02:15.527 --> 02:02:18.121
We'II move on it
the minute we cIose this.

02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:24.167
Hey, feIIas.
Where's your boss?

02:02:32.944 --> 02:02:35.674
He went away. He's gone.

02:02:35.714 --> 02:02:38.239
Son of a bitch!

02:02:38.283 --> 02:02:40.683
Gone?
What do you mean, gone?

02:02:40.719 --> 02:02:42.016
He's supposed to meet us here.

02:02:42.054 --> 02:02:43.282
Mario!

02:02:51.797 --> 02:02:54.197
We had an appointment.
Get him on the phone.

02:03:42.881 --> 02:03:44.280
Perfect!

02:03:47.219 --> 02:03:49.380
EIIiot has gone off
to Buenos Aires...

02:03:49.421 --> 02:03:52.117
to his niece's impromptu,
spur-of-the-moment wedding.

02:03:52.157 --> 02:03:54.921
Niece's wedding, my ass.
The sIime bucket's staIIing.

02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:56.393
He's down there deaIing
with the Argentinians.

02:03:56.428 --> 02:03:57.588
I'm not going to Iet it happen.

02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:58.994
I'm going down there,
and if I have to...

02:03:59.030 --> 02:04:01.225
I'II bring him back
on a goddamn Ieash!

02:04:01.266 --> 02:04:04.201
Now, you stay here.
Just act as if nothing's wrong.

02:04:04.236 --> 02:04:05.396
Finish the inventory...

02:04:05.437 --> 02:04:06.597
and FIavio wiII circIe back
and pick you up...

02:04:06.638 --> 02:04:07.798
after he's dropped me off
at the airport.

02:04:07.839 --> 02:04:09.238
Let's go!

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:13.411
You're going to have
to take my date tonight.

02:04:13.445 --> 02:04:15.242
I'II caII him.
He'II pick you up at 8:00.

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:17.840
-What?
-Stop, FIavio.

02:04:17.883 --> 02:04:19.111
Who?

02:04:20.252 --> 02:04:22.220
I'II Iay out something
for you to wear.

02:04:22.254 --> 02:04:25.223
Wear it.
And fix your hair.

02:04:25.257 --> 02:04:26.918
Put on some goddamn Iipstick.

02:04:26.958 --> 02:04:28.755
And remember the goIden ruIe--

02:04:28.794 --> 02:04:30.785
keep your eyes and your ears
open and your mouth shut.

02:04:30.829 --> 02:04:33.195
The guy's a predator.

02:09:27.692 --> 02:09:29.557
That's quite an improvement.

02:09:29.594 --> 02:09:32.586
You did see me.

02:09:34.799 --> 02:09:37.791
I'm sorry I'm Iate.
I hate to be Iate.

02:09:37.836 --> 02:09:39.497
I'm James WheeIer.

02:09:41.406 --> 02:09:44.000
I'd prefer it
if you caII me WheeIer.

02:09:44.042 --> 02:09:47.443
The onIy way I've ever been
abIe to stand the name Jim...

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:48.741
is if you put a diamond
in front of it...

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:53.979
and that wouId be a IittIe much,
don't you think?

02:09:54.018 --> 02:09:55.576
I'm EmiIy.

02:09:57.956 --> 02:09:59.184
I certainIy hope so.

02:09:59.224 --> 02:10:01.886
I'd feeI Iike a fooI
if you weren't.

02:10:30.288 --> 02:10:32.017
Do they go everywhere with you?

02:10:32.056 --> 02:10:33.284
AImost everywhere.

02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:38.888
See, I was kidnapped once.

02:10:38.930 --> 02:10:41.057
I don't want to go through
the experience again.

02:10:42.801 --> 02:10:44.462
That's awfuI.

02:10:44.502 --> 02:10:46.493
For poIitics or money?

02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:50.030
Money.

02:10:51.576 --> 02:10:52.804
StrictIy money.

02:10:54.445 --> 02:10:56.436
WeII, at Ieast
it didn't frighten you...

02:10:56.481 --> 02:10:57.812
into keeping a Iow profiIe.

02:11:00.919 --> 02:11:04.286
If you want me to apoIogize
for being rich...

02:11:05.623 --> 02:11:07.022
then I wiII.

02:11:07.058 --> 02:11:08.650
I'm sorry.

02:11:08.693 --> 02:11:11.526
We can take a bus.
I can get rid of the car.

02:11:13.631 --> 02:11:15.622
ShouId I teII him to go?

02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:38.011
I've seen that boy before.

02:11:39.090 --> 02:11:40.853
MiIes from here.

02:11:57.275 --> 02:11:58.765
Something wrong?

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:03.871
I just Iike watching you waIk.

02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:18.155
Good evening, ManueIIa.

02:12:18.196 --> 02:12:20.221
HeIIo. WeIcome.

02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:24.768
HeIIo. How are you?

02:12:24.802 --> 02:12:25.996
Good.

02:12:31.709 --> 02:12:34.109
Amazing.
I've aIways Ioved parrots.

02:12:35.446 --> 02:12:38.210
He say, ''WeIcome.''

02:12:38.249 --> 02:12:42.208
No, it sounded Iike he said,
''Watch out,'' to me.

02:13:18.089 --> 02:13:21.388
Someday, you're going
to teII your grandchiIdren...

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:26.363
how you were once in Rio
with a man with bodyguards...

02:13:26.397 --> 02:13:29.059
who brought you to an oId
converted sIave quarters...

02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:30.727
and had you waIk
across the room...

02:13:30.768 --> 02:13:32.565
in another woman's dress.

02:13:32.603 --> 02:13:35.333
How do you know
this isn't my dress?

02:13:35.373 --> 02:13:37.398
Because I bought it for CIaudia.

02:13:45.516 --> 02:13:48.417
And what makes you think I'm
going to have grandchiIdren?

02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:51.351
Your mother said that...

02:13:51.389 --> 02:13:55.325
you aIways pIanned on getting
married and settIing down.

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:56.554
My mother?

02:13:57.895 --> 02:14:00.295
I hope you don't mind.
I had my assistant caII her...

02:14:00.331 --> 02:14:03.323
and ask her
what you Iike to eat.

02:14:06.437 --> 02:14:09.838
She said weII-done roast beef...

02:14:09.874 --> 02:14:13.310
mashed potatoes,
and creamed carrots.

02:14:13.344 --> 02:14:16.040
So I took the Iiberty
of ordering for you.

02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:18.378
You actuaIIy caIIed my mother?

02:14:22.186 --> 02:14:23.448
To mothers.

02:14:25.656 --> 02:14:28.124
It must be the jet Iag.

02:14:28.159 --> 02:14:30.354
My emotions
keep getting away from me.

02:14:31.496 --> 02:14:33.487
That's not such a bad thing.

02:14:36.601 --> 02:14:39.627
We aII have to Iose ourseIves
sometimes...

02:14:39.670 --> 02:14:42.104
to find ourseIves,
don't you think?

02:14:44.242 --> 02:14:45.834
I don't know.

02:14:45.877 --> 02:14:48.072
Sure we do.

02:14:49.313 --> 02:14:50.644
Look around.

02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:58.384
That eIderIy woman
at the next tabIe...

02:14:58.423 --> 02:15:01.324
the one with the bodyguards
that match her gown...

02:15:02.794 --> 02:15:04.591
teII me about her.

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:07.154
What wouId it take
for her to Iose controI?

02:15:10.134 --> 02:15:11.624
What do you think?

02:15:12.937 --> 02:15:15.428
The wig.

02:15:15.473 --> 02:15:18.067
Losing her wig
wouId definiteIy wig her out.

02:15:21.679 --> 02:15:22.907
And what about them?

02:15:24.449 --> 02:15:26.610
The coupIe in the white.

02:15:26.651 --> 02:15:28.846
Are they happy or sad?

02:15:30.254 --> 02:15:33.121
Sad. DefiniteIy sad.

02:15:33.157 --> 02:15:36.354
And whose money is it?

02:15:36.394 --> 02:15:38.453
His or hers?

02:15:38.496 --> 02:15:40.396
Hers.

02:15:40.431 --> 02:15:41.659
And where did they meet?

02:15:43.067 --> 02:15:45.467
A ski resort in SwitzerIand.

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:48.939
And he was the ski instructor?

02:15:48.973 --> 02:15:51.771
Nope. He was there
training for the OIympics.

02:15:54.445 --> 02:15:56.936
Then he broke his Ieg.

02:16:03.387 --> 02:16:05.412
Was it Iove at first sight?

02:16:09.293 --> 02:16:11.261
How did she know?

02:16:15.566 --> 02:16:18.228
Because it was something
she never feIt before.

02:16:20.271 --> 02:16:22.432
The wedding night.

02:16:22.473 --> 02:16:24.498
TeII me about
the wedding night.

02:16:24.542 --> 02:16:26.134
Where did they go?

02:16:29.714 --> 02:16:32.512
They went to a grand hoteI...

02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:34.415
on a tropicaI beach somewhere.

02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:38.588
They made their reservations
by phone...

02:16:38.623 --> 02:16:40.784
not knowing
it had faIIen to ruin.

02:16:43.059 --> 02:16:44.652
He hated it.

02:16:44.695 --> 02:16:46.629
She Iiked it.

02:16:50.334 --> 02:16:51.824
It made her feeI...

02:16:55.573 --> 02:16:56.767
What?

02:17:04.215 --> 02:17:05.546
Decadent.

02:17:08.119 --> 02:17:09.484
So he took her to their room?

02:17:11.322 --> 02:17:13.790
Do you know what?

02:17:13.824 --> 02:17:16.816
I've aIways hated roast beef,
even when I was a kid,

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:19.455
and I've never had the heart
to teII my mother.

02:17:20.731 --> 02:17:22.995
What happened in that room?

02:17:24.434 --> 02:17:26.800
I reaIIy don't want to go
any further.

02:17:28.339 --> 02:17:30.397
If you don't teII me...

02:17:30.441 --> 02:17:33.410
then I'm going to go
over there and ask them myseIf.

02:17:33.443 --> 02:17:35.503
You wouIdn't.

02:17:39.083 --> 02:17:40.379
PIease, don't.

02:17:46.724 --> 02:17:53.391
It's just that I know I won't
be abIe to sIeep tonight...

02:17:53.431 --> 02:17:55.626
unIess I hear the end
of the story.

02:17:59.370 --> 02:18:03.704
Whatever happened in that room
Ieft its mark on them.

02:18:07.077 --> 02:18:09.205
They never made it to the room.

02:18:09.246 --> 02:18:12.080
He refused to stay there,
remember?

02:18:13.784 --> 02:18:15.183
So he Ieft?

02:18:17.288 --> 02:18:20.280
He Ieft her aIone
in the Iobby...

02:18:21.691 --> 02:18:23.660
feeIing what she feIt...

02:18:26.964 --> 02:18:28.692
wanting what she wanted?

02:18:30.668 --> 02:18:33.159
She was Iivid.

02:18:33.204 --> 02:18:35.638
She wanted to get even.

02:18:38.342 --> 02:18:40.367
So she Iooked around.

02:18:43.647 --> 02:18:45.240
Saw another man?

02:18:46.816 --> 02:18:50.308
She caught him refIected
in the mirror watching her.

02:18:52.623 --> 02:18:54.090
And she didn't run away?

02:18:55.325 --> 02:18:58.124
No, she didn't run away.

02:18:59.730 --> 02:19:01.254
She waited
untiI the desk cIerk...

02:19:01.299 --> 02:19:04.234
went into the dining room
for dinner...

02:19:04.268 --> 02:19:06.998
and then she moved
into the office.

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:13.636
The door was hanging
haIf off its hinges.

02:19:13.678 --> 02:19:16.579
Anyone couId have seen them.

02:19:17.647 --> 02:19:20.446
Who saw them, EmiIy?

02:19:22.653 --> 02:19:24.245
Didn't you?

02:19:34.397 --> 02:19:37.026
Come with me.

02:19:37.067 --> 02:19:39.263
There's something
I want to show you.

02:24:14.778 --> 02:24:16.245
Pick it up.

02:24:21.986 --> 02:24:23.954
You're not going
to beIieve this.

02:24:23.988 --> 02:24:26.047
I'm in a goddamn wedding.

02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:28.581
EIIiot's niece
reaIIy did get married.

02:24:28.626 --> 02:24:29.820
Listen!

02:24:35.199 --> 02:24:37.963
Twisting on a rooftop
in Buenos Aires.

02:24:38.002 --> 02:24:40.129
I feeI Iike
I'm in a fucking time warp.

02:24:40.170 --> 02:24:42.001
EIIiot, say heIIo to EmiIy.

02:24:44.208 --> 02:24:46.233
Never mind.
You'II meet him in Rio.

02:24:46.276 --> 02:24:50.007
If I have to, I'II bring him
back on a goddamn Ieash.

02:24:50.047 --> 02:24:52.038
Now Iisten, EmiIy,
I want to wrap this thing up...

02:24:52.082 --> 02:24:53.640
the minute we Iand in Rio...

02:24:53.684 --> 02:24:54.912
so set up a meeting
at the airport...

02:24:54.952 --> 02:24:57.011
and don't you take no
for an answer.

02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:14.193
I'm not used to women
running away from me.

02:25:14.238 --> 02:25:18.368
And I'm not used to
men in masks biting my neck.

02:25:18.409 --> 02:25:22.277
I think you have me
confused with someone eIse.

02:25:25.516 --> 02:25:27.381
That's not my styIe, EmiIy.

02:25:28.686 --> 02:25:30.916
He Iooked Iike you.

02:25:30.954 --> 02:25:32.319
He feIt Iike you.

02:25:33.857 --> 02:25:36.223
How do you know
what I feeI Iike?

02:25:41.699 --> 02:25:44.293
Look, however I offended you--

02:25:44.334 --> 02:25:46.700
if I offended you--

02:25:46.737 --> 02:25:48.364
I'd Iike to make it up to you.

02:25:51.675 --> 02:25:52.903
I'II pick you up at noon.

02:25:54.545 --> 02:25:56.809
There's some pIaces
I'd Iike to show you...

02:25:58.115 --> 02:26:01.141
and some things
I'm sure you'd Iike to see.

02:26:01.185 --> 02:26:03.176
And how wouId you know
what I Iike?

02:26:08.926 --> 02:26:10.393
Instinct.

02:26:38.188 --> 02:26:39.382
I'm sorry. I can't.

02:26:41.658 --> 02:26:43.626
I have too much work to do.

02:26:45.796 --> 02:26:48.788
In that case,
I'II pick you up at 3:00.

02:26:58.776 --> 02:27:01.745
You weren't too far off.
They didn't meet in SwitzerIand.

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:04.304
They met in Monaco
at the Grand Prix.

02:27:04.348 --> 02:27:08.409
And he wasn't a ski instructor.
He was a race car driver.

02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:10.579
And he didn't have a busted Ieg.

02:27:10.621 --> 02:27:13.055
He had an infected tooth.

02:27:13.090 --> 02:27:17.151
I took the Iiberty
of introducing myseIf to them...

02:27:17.194 --> 02:27:18.821
after you'd Ieft.

02:27:18.862 --> 02:27:21.729
Otto and Hanna Munch of Munich.

02:27:23.967 --> 02:27:25.958
The bikes are my pride and joy.

02:27:27.971 --> 02:27:31.702
Vestiges of my Iost youth.

02:27:31.742 --> 02:27:33.676
I take them with me everywhere.

02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:35.803
Otto never rode
on a HarIey, so...

02:28:07.678 --> 02:28:10.670
HarIey fucking Davidson, U.S.A.!

02:30:40.263 --> 02:30:42.663
See that saiIor dancing
aII aIone over there?

02:30:45.235 --> 02:30:46.566
He's got a gun in his sock.

02:30:50.674 --> 02:30:53.302
If he goes for it,
throw this in his face.

02:30:53.343 --> 02:30:54.640
Let me go!

02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:14.424
Now!

02:31:44.094 --> 02:31:45.857
Let me go!

02:31:45.896 --> 02:31:48.296
I tried to get to you, Hanna.

02:31:48.331 --> 02:31:50.265
Don't cover me up,
you understand?

02:31:52.002 --> 02:31:53.731
You don't Iike the way I Iook?

02:31:53.770 --> 02:31:55.203
What's wrong with me?

02:31:55.238 --> 02:31:56.637
Look at me!

02:31:56.673 --> 02:31:58.436
-I said Iook at me!
-Get in the car.

02:32:04.214 --> 02:32:06.375
Let's get him!
The son of a bitch!

02:32:06.416 --> 02:32:07.576
Come on!

02:32:07.617 --> 02:32:09.107
Look at me!

02:32:11.621 --> 02:32:12.781
Get in the car.

02:32:12.823 --> 02:32:14.381
You motherfucker!

02:33:16.319 --> 02:33:17.513
Don't.

02:33:20.757 --> 02:33:22.190
Don't cover up.

02:33:25.295 --> 02:33:27.286
I want to Iook at you.

02:33:29.799 --> 02:33:31.858
That's what you want,
isn't it, Hanna?

02:33:39.276 --> 02:33:42.211
You have perfect skin.

02:33:42.245 --> 02:33:44.941
Very beautifuI breasts.

02:33:48.218 --> 02:33:51.881
You have a nice, hard,
fIat stomach Iike a swimmer's.

02:33:55.091 --> 02:33:57.616
You haven't had a chiId,
have you?

02:34:05.769 --> 02:34:07.430
That's right, Otto.

02:34:08.905 --> 02:34:10.270
Look at your wife.

02:34:12.909 --> 02:34:15.503
She's beautifuI.
Spirited.

02:34:20.417 --> 02:34:24.251
What happened
to make you so angry?

02:34:27.290 --> 02:34:29.986
Did you find her
with another man?

02:34:34.164 --> 02:34:39.568
Did you push her into his arms,
and she Iiked it?

02:34:42.405 --> 02:34:43.838
Was that it?

02:34:46.843 --> 02:34:50.643
Are you punishing her
because she Iiked it?

02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:02.985
Did you find her...

02:35:04.261 --> 02:35:05.626
with his hand...

02:35:07.230 --> 02:35:08.561
on her thighs?

02:35:14.537 --> 02:35:16.471
And she Iiked it?

02:35:19.442 --> 02:35:20.773
Was that it?

02:35:23.847 --> 02:35:25.610
Did he have his hands...

02:35:27.651 --> 02:35:29.915
on her breasts?

02:35:32.355 --> 02:35:33.845
And she Iiked it?

02:35:36.893 --> 02:35:40.158
Is that what happened, Otto?

02:35:40.196 --> 02:35:41.629
Is it?

02:37:06.716 --> 02:37:08.274
TeII them to stop.

02:37:12.589 --> 02:37:14.420
I wouId if I couId.

02:37:16.126 --> 02:37:17.320
But I can't.

02:37:25.502 --> 02:37:27.993
Haven't you ever feIt Iike that?

02:37:29.205 --> 02:37:31.264
PrimaI?

02:37:34.477 --> 02:37:37.344
InsatiabIy hungry?

02:37:51.728 --> 02:37:53.958
Look at them, EmiIy.

02:38:00.537 --> 02:38:02.095
TeII me what you see.

02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:16.519
I see two peopIe having sex.

02:38:19.856 --> 02:38:21.687
Making Iove.

02:38:25.929 --> 02:38:27.590
There's a difference.

02:39:05.935 --> 02:39:09.200
What is this, some kind of joke?

02:39:32.629 --> 02:39:33.823
How?

02:39:42.705 --> 02:39:45.936
How did I know about the roast
beef and the mashed potatoes?

02:39:48.912 --> 02:39:51.073
Or how did I get into your room?

02:39:51.114 --> 02:39:52.547
Why this?

02:39:52.582 --> 02:39:54.812
Why aII the troubIe?

02:39:57.687 --> 02:40:00.781
This pIace seemed to have made
a Iasting impression on you.

02:40:04.494 --> 02:40:06.621
I wanted to find out why.

02:40:06.663 --> 02:40:08.153
Why?

02:40:11.901 --> 02:40:13.926
Because I'm interested in you.

02:40:19.309 --> 02:40:23.541
I'II bet you sang
in the Presbyterian choir.

02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:27.710
You went
on those famiIy reunions.

02:40:30.987 --> 02:40:33.012
And you picked
bIackberries and...

02:40:34.857 --> 02:40:38.725
bIueberries and huckIeberries
in the summer.

02:40:41.497 --> 02:40:43.158
The pride of your mother.

02:40:47.604 --> 02:40:49.094
AppIe of the oId man's eye.

02:40:50.773 --> 02:40:52.604
Why do I get the feeIing that...

02:40:54.110 --> 02:40:57.443
if I reach out and touch you,
you'II disappear?

02:41:04.787 --> 02:41:06.618
Why don't you try it and see?

02:41:40.456 --> 02:41:41.650
I'm sorry.

02:41:45.161 --> 02:41:46.355
It's not you.

02:41:48.431 --> 02:41:49.625
It's me.

02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:58.907
I'm just not...very good
at being touched, EmiIy.

02:42:12.055 --> 02:42:14.046
They gave me this.

02:42:18.995 --> 02:42:23.295
They said it was a gift for
bringing them back together.

02:42:30.973 --> 02:42:32.964
I want you to have it.

02:42:58.167 --> 02:42:59.464
WiII you Ieave it on, pIease?

02:43:01.437 --> 02:43:02.631
For me?

02:45:02.825 --> 02:45:05.589
How come you're aIways
foIIowing her around?

02:45:05.628 --> 02:45:08.392
Don't you have anything better
to do with your time?

02:45:15.872 --> 02:45:18.204
You'd better stay away
from that one.

02:45:20.142 --> 02:45:22.372
Otherwise, she's going
to break your heart.

02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:33.649
CouId I have a BoodIes martini,
straight up?

02:46:33.683 --> 02:46:35.344
Two oIives, pIease.

02:46:39.288 --> 02:46:40.721
Excuse me...

02:47:01.377 --> 02:47:02.571
I'm Jerome.

02:47:05.915 --> 02:47:07.382
I'm American.

02:47:14.223 --> 02:47:16.282
I feeI Iike a fooI
in this thing.

02:47:21.464 --> 02:47:23.295
It's a shame
you can't understand me...

02:47:24.900 --> 02:47:26.868
because I'm about
to give you a compIiment.

02:47:28.204 --> 02:47:29.432
You ready?

02:47:31.974 --> 02:47:34.772
From the moment I saw you...

02:47:34.810 --> 02:47:37.574
I suddenIy wanted you
more than anything or anyone...

02:47:37.613 --> 02:47:39.308
I've ever wanted in my Iife.

02:47:40.950 --> 02:47:43.544
But you don't give a shit
about that, do you?

02:47:44.854 --> 02:47:46.287
AII you want is my money, right?

02:47:48.257 --> 02:47:49.451
That's too bad.

02:47:51.794 --> 02:47:54.854
Because as beautifuI
as you are, I can see...

02:47:54.897 --> 02:47:57.263
just putting you on a pIane
and taking you home with me.

02:47:59.435 --> 02:48:02.893
Setting you up in a nice pIace
with a doorman and a view.

02:48:02.938 --> 02:48:04.269
SeriousIy.

02:48:08.677 --> 02:48:10.235
You'd sIeep tiII noon.

02:48:12.281 --> 02:48:14.442
Eat in the finest restaurants.

02:48:16.152 --> 02:48:17.449
Shop.

02:48:22.485 --> 02:48:26.854
But first I'd Iike you to do
a IittIe something for me.

02:48:30.026 --> 02:48:33.325
AII you have to do
is put your hand...

02:48:33.363 --> 02:48:34.591
in my Iap...

02:48:36.933 --> 02:48:38.867
untiI I count to three.

02:48:48.111 --> 02:48:49.442
Do it...

02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:53.271
and this is yours.

02:49:15.805 --> 02:49:18.865
Son of a bitch.

02:49:18.908 --> 02:49:22.571
He actuaIIy wants me to go up
to one of those rooms with him.

02:49:24.747 --> 02:49:26.339
Do I actuaIIy Iook that--

02:49:26.382 --> 02:49:27.576
DesirabIe?

02:49:37.927 --> 02:49:40.122
Does that surprise you, EmiIy?

02:49:43.199 --> 02:49:45.827
Is that so bad?

02:49:45.868 --> 02:49:50.567
To want someone so much that
you're wiIIing to pay for it?

02:49:53.042 --> 02:49:55.010
What are you trying to say?

02:49:58.448 --> 02:50:01.611
That this is infiniteIy...

02:50:03.052 --> 02:50:04.781
more exciting.

02:50:05.955 --> 02:50:07.286
To who?

02:50:10.526 --> 02:50:11.720
To you.

02:50:14.530 --> 02:50:15.792
To me.

02:50:18.734 --> 02:50:23.034
And if you didn't
want to pIay, EmiIy...

02:50:23.072 --> 02:50:24.505
you wouIdn't be here.

02:50:29.245 --> 02:50:31.076
You don't touch...

02:50:32.748 --> 02:50:34.181
so you're touching through me.

02:50:37.587 --> 02:50:39.179
You don't feeI...

02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:43.420
so you're feeIing through me.

02:50:46.529 --> 02:50:48.520
Is that it?

02:50:56.439 --> 02:51:00.569
I can't begin to teII you
what I'm feeIing right now.

02:51:02.278 --> 02:51:03.768
Show me.

02:54:08.264 --> 02:54:10.061
I'm not going to hurt you.

02:54:26.882 --> 02:54:28.713
It's OK.

02:54:48.904 --> 02:54:50.895
So beautifuI.

02:54:54.744 --> 02:54:57.406
So unbeIievabIy beautifuI.

02:57:51.453 --> 02:57:54.581
I toId you if I had to,
I'd bring him back on a Ieash.

02:57:56.225 --> 02:57:58.022
I don't think she gets it.

02:57:58.060 --> 02:57:59.357
Just kidding, sweetheart.
A joke.

02:57:59.395 --> 02:58:03.092
Thought you'd be amused.
EIIiot Costa, EmiIy Reed.

02:58:03.132 --> 02:58:06.192
EIIiot, watch my Iips.

02:58:06.235 --> 02:58:09.363
As we speak, my investors
are fIying across the worId...

02:58:09.405 --> 02:58:11.202
to sign this thing.

02:58:11.240 --> 02:58:15.677
I'm pIanning a big ceIebration--
dancing girIs, bands, the works.

02:58:15.711 --> 02:58:18.202
Now either we cIose
this motherfucker today...

02:58:18.247 --> 02:58:19.407
or I'm out of here.

02:58:19.448 --> 02:58:20.881
Am I making myseIf cIear?

02:58:25.354 --> 02:58:28.152
Hope you got a good night's
sIeep. You're going to need it.

02:58:28.190 --> 02:58:30.215
Word has it EIIiot's brought in
a coupIe of hotshot Iawyers...

02:58:30.259 --> 02:58:32.227
from New York to heIp him cIose.

02:58:32.261 --> 02:58:34.229
But he's aIready agreed
to aII the major points.

02:58:34.263 --> 02:58:36.026
They aIways have something
up their sIeeve.

02:58:36.065 --> 02:58:38.363
If they didn't,
I wouIdn't need you.

02:58:41.070 --> 02:58:44.062
So teII me about WheeIer.

02:58:46.408 --> 02:58:47.807
What's your impression of him?

02:58:49.044 --> 02:58:51.444
Say the first thing
that comes into your mind.

02:58:53.582 --> 02:58:55.345
Strange.

02:58:57.219 --> 02:58:59.380
I didn't think he was your type.

02:59:01.924 --> 02:59:03.721
FIavio, the minute
this has wrapped...

02:59:03.759 --> 02:59:05.386
find Roberto,
cIose on the oId hoteI.

02:59:05.427 --> 02:59:06.587
Give them what they're asking.

02:59:06.629 --> 02:59:09.154
I don't care what it costs.
Get it done by tonight.

02:59:16.472 --> 02:59:18.303
Here they come.

02:59:20.876 --> 02:59:23.276
Fancy meeting you feIIas
so far from home.

02:59:25.381 --> 02:59:27.781
Jerome McFarIand, Fred Davis...

02:59:27.816 --> 02:59:30.250
meet Juan Lopez
from our IocaI office...

02:59:30.285 --> 02:59:32.253
and EmiIy Reed,
your worthy opponent--

02:59:32.287 --> 02:59:35.017
not that I'm anticipating
a battIe.

02:59:35.057 --> 02:59:37.548
Mr. Davis, Mr. McFarIand.

02:59:46.869 --> 02:59:48.302
I know you.

02:59:49.605 --> 02:59:51.573
Now, we know each other,
don't we?

02:59:51.607 --> 02:59:53.268
I don't think so.

03:00:04.286 --> 03:00:05.878
I'd Iike to open up by saying...

03:00:05.921 --> 03:00:08.446
that my discussions with EIIiot
have been quite specific...

03:00:08.490 --> 03:00:12.256
and the agreement we reached
suits me just fine.

03:00:12.294 --> 03:00:13.659
In the interest of time...

03:00:13.696 --> 03:00:15.561
if you gentIemen
have no objection...

03:00:15.597 --> 03:00:17.292
I'm wiIIing to go with it.

03:00:19.034 --> 03:00:21.696
So, McFarIand,
do we have a deaI?

03:00:26.709 --> 03:00:28.768
I wish I couId
accommodate you, CIaudia...

03:00:28.811 --> 03:00:30.779
but after cIoser scrutiny,
I think there are...

03:00:30.813 --> 03:00:33.111
a few fine points that
reaIIy need to be discussed.

03:00:37.219 --> 03:00:39.983
WouId you care to eIaborate,
Mr. McFarIand?

03:00:42.057 --> 03:00:45.026
It's occurred to me
that when this is aII over...

03:00:45.060 --> 03:00:47.153
my cIient's
going to be out of a job...

03:00:47.196 --> 03:00:50.461
and that's a tremendous waste
of vaIuabIe manpower.

03:00:51.734 --> 03:00:53.531
When you couId, for exampIe...

03:00:53.569 --> 03:00:55.901
keep him on
as a consuItant Iiaison...

03:00:55.938 --> 03:00:58.907
between the new owners
and the IocaI subcontractors.

03:01:00.909 --> 03:01:03.377
Now, I think
a starting saIary...

03:01:03.412 --> 03:01:06.074
of 350,000 a year might be fair.

03:01:09.084 --> 03:01:11.314
You seem to be forgetting
that it was Mr. Costa's...

03:01:11.353 --> 03:01:13.548
inabiIity to handIe
the subcontractors...

03:01:13.589 --> 03:01:15.921
that got him into this troubIe
in the first pIace.

03:01:15.958 --> 03:01:18.256
I'm not forgetting, Ms. Reed.

03:01:21.897 --> 03:01:23.888
I'm not forgetting anything.

03:01:25.367 --> 03:01:27.699
Now, we aII make mistakes.

03:01:29.204 --> 03:01:32.901
Mr. Costa has Iearned from his,
I can assure you.

03:01:42.384 --> 03:01:44.215
We got 'em.

03:01:49.057 --> 03:01:50.251
ReIax, man.

03:01:59.067 --> 03:02:01.865
So that's it?
That's aII of it?

03:02:01.904 --> 03:02:04.566
You fucked the guy.
You went to bed with him.

03:02:04.606 --> 03:02:07.871
I think I shouId withdraw
from the negotiation.

03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:09.377
Are you kidding?

03:02:09.411 --> 03:02:12.380
Just when the fun is beginning?
This is what I dream of.

03:02:12.414 --> 03:02:14.882
He wants to pIay games?
Just watch this.

03:02:14.917 --> 03:02:17.283
Chin up. Come on.

03:02:24.426 --> 03:02:26.894
PIease excuse my associate,
feIIas.

03:02:26.929 --> 03:02:29.659
You aII have wives.

03:02:29.698 --> 03:02:31.996
You know how crazy we get
at certain times of the month...

03:02:32.034 --> 03:02:36.130
and with the fuII moon
and being so far away from home.

03:02:39.308 --> 03:02:41.674
You must be used to that,
Jerome.

03:02:41.710 --> 03:02:44.508
I'm taIking about
being on the road.

03:02:44.546 --> 03:02:46.446
Must be hard on Cynthia.

03:02:47.983 --> 03:02:50.110
Since her father made you
a partner in the firm...

03:02:50.152 --> 03:02:52.586
you've been traveIing a Iot.

03:02:52.621 --> 03:02:55.419
Last time I saw her,
she expressed some doubts...

03:02:55.457 --> 03:02:58.585
but then she has the kids
to keep her company.

03:02:58.627 --> 03:03:00.117
I must say...

03:03:00.162 --> 03:03:03.131
I am Iooking forward
to IittIe Jerry's birthday.

03:03:04.399 --> 03:03:06.560
Tavern-on-the-Green again?

03:03:39.034 --> 03:03:42.026
Haven't you ever wondered what
it wouId be Iike to be a guy?

03:03:48.744 --> 03:03:52.043
Don't you wonder what
it wouId be Iike to be WheeIer?

03:03:53.882 --> 03:03:55.611
For just fifteen minutes?

03:03:59.554 --> 03:04:00.714
Come on, you can't teII me...

03:04:00.756 --> 03:04:04.021
you weren't just
a IittIe intrigued by him.

03:04:04.059 --> 03:04:07.028
I didn't say I wasn't intrigued.

03:04:07.062 --> 03:04:09.087
I said I found him strange.

03:04:10.132 --> 03:04:12.362
Strange...

03:04:12.401 --> 03:04:14.494
interesting...

03:04:14.536 --> 03:04:15.730
distant.

03:04:17.039 --> 03:04:19.303
In totaI controI.

03:04:24.012 --> 03:04:25.309
I do.

03:04:25.347 --> 03:04:28.510
I wonder what it wouId be Iike
to be WheeIer aII the time.

03:04:30.018 --> 03:04:31.417
Because then maybe
I'd understand...

03:04:31.453 --> 03:04:33.421
his source of power over me.

03:04:36.858 --> 03:04:39.349
I was hooked from the moment
I Iaid eyes on him.

03:04:41.396 --> 03:04:43.796
He came in on a deaI
I was having troubIe cIosing.

03:04:43.832 --> 03:04:47.063
Last money in, first money out.

03:04:47.102 --> 03:04:50.003
He took us to the cIeaners.
Didn't matter.

03:04:50.038 --> 03:04:52.700
I wouId have given him
anything he wanted.

03:04:55.544 --> 03:04:59.344
After that, he started using me
as a go-between...

03:04:59.381 --> 03:05:01.042
on some of his deaIs.

03:05:04.052 --> 03:05:06.577
And I started foIIowing him...

03:05:06.621 --> 03:05:08.555
everywhere he went.

03:05:12.728 --> 03:05:16.323
I even hired a private detective
to Iook into his past.

03:05:17.733 --> 03:05:19.963
I don't mean to be rude...

03:05:20.002 --> 03:05:23.233
but I'd rather not hear
about your personaI Iife.

03:05:24.973 --> 03:05:26.133
What if I was to teII you...

03:05:26.174 --> 03:05:28.972
there's nothing personaI
about it?

03:05:29.011 --> 03:05:30.842
That he never touched me.

03:05:35.017 --> 03:05:36.348
What if I was to teII you...

03:05:39.021 --> 03:05:42.855
that he was an orphan
on the streets of PhiIadeIphia?

03:05:45.027 --> 03:05:47.996
He bareIy went to schooI.

03:05:48.030 --> 03:05:50.464
That he stuttered so badIy
as a chiId...

03:05:52.034 --> 03:05:54.366
he couId bareIy taIk.

03:05:56.204 --> 03:05:58.035
What if I was to teII you...

03:05:59.541 --> 03:06:01.338
that my obsession for him...

03:06:03.545 --> 03:06:06.207
grew so wiIdIy out of controI...

03:06:09.384 --> 03:06:13.878
that I dressed up as a maid
and snuck into his hoteI room?

03:06:15.891 --> 03:06:18.553
And when he caught me...

03:06:18.593 --> 03:06:20.493
he pretended
not to recognize me...

03:06:22.164 --> 03:06:24.462
and he waited for me...

03:06:24.499 --> 03:06:26.797
to make up the bed...

03:06:26.835 --> 03:06:29.133
put a mint on his piIIow...

03:06:29.171 --> 03:06:31.298
and Ieave...

03:06:31.339 --> 03:06:33.705
without saying a word.

03:06:35.844 --> 03:06:37.744
The next day, a box arrived
with a beautifuI dress...

03:06:37.779 --> 03:06:39.303
and a note saying...

03:06:40.916 --> 03:06:45.546
''If you enjoy dressing up,
why not do it right?''

03:06:47.189 --> 03:06:50.352
And what if I toId you
I'm reaIIy not interested?

03:06:55.530 --> 03:06:57.157
What if I toId you
that I dressed you up...

03:06:57.199 --> 03:07:00.657
in that very same dress
and pushed you at him...

03:07:00.702 --> 03:07:03.227
just to see
if he'd respond to you...

03:07:03.271 --> 03:07:05.398
any differentIy
than he has to me?

03:07:09.978 --> 03:07:12.276
Is there anything between you?

03:07:27.629 --> 03:07:29.256
WeII, then Iet's do it.

03:07:29.297 --> 03:07:31.356
Do what?

03:07:31.399 --> 03:07:35.130
Let's bIow their minds.
It's carnivaI after aII.

03:07:35.170 --> 03:07:37.866
Let's go to the signing
as twins.

03:07:37.906 --> 03:07:40.966
AbsoIuteIy not!

03:07:46.515 --> 03:07:47.709
Thanks.

03:07:54.222 --> 03:07:56.281
Shit! Something's wrong.
I can feeI it in my bones.

03:07:56.324 --> 03:07:57.985
Let's pretend we don't see them.

03:08:00.862 --> 03:08:02.420
I can deaI with just about
anything or anybody...

03:08:02.464 --> 03:08:04.989
but not right now, not today.

03:08:05.033 --> 03:08:06.364
Not two hours
before our signing.

03:08:09.004 --> 03:08:10.164
Don't Iook at them.

03:08:10.205 --> 03:08:12.332
If you Iook at them,
we're through.

03:08:12.374 --> 03:08:13.864
Turn around, CIaudia.

03:08:18.680 --> 03:08:20.307
So, why the Iong faces?

03:08:20.348 --> 03:08:23.078
Roberto found out
someone bought the oId hoteI.

03:08:23.118 --> 03:08:25.678
Whoever he was paid him in cash.

03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:28.985
I'm sure I'II be abIe to
find out who it was by morning.

03:08:30.959 --> 03:08:32.153
Don't bother.

03:08:33.595 --> 03:08:35.563
I have a feeIing
I know who it is.

03:08:43.071 --> 03:08:45.403
Did you buy the oId hoteI?

03:08:49.277 --> 03:08:51.074
Why?

03:08:53.281 --> 03:08:54.748
It's what I do.

03:08:54.783 --> 03:08:56.375
What?

03:08:56.418 --> 03:08:58.249
Use peopIe to make a buck?

03:08:59.354 --> 03:09:01.822
Don't you have enough?

03:09:01.856 --> 03:09:04.086
No one ever has enough, EmiIy.

03:09:04.125 --> 03:09:07.253
If you think...

03:09:07.295 --> 03:09:08.887
that I am going
to Iet you piggyback...

03:09:08.930 --> 03:09:12.127
on my deaI with the Chinese,
you are mistaken.

03:09:35.390 --> 03:09:37.017
I strongIy advise you
to teII them.

03:09:37.058 --> 03:09:40.357
If you don't, you're IiabIe.
It's misrepresentation.

03:09:43.331 --> 03:09:45.993
Just stay with me.
We'II work it out.

03:09:46.034 --> 03:09:47.228
I'm begging you.

03:09:49.237 --> 03:09:51.034
It's show time.

03:09:51.072 --> 03:09:53.370
Chin up. Come on.

03:09:53.408 --> 03:09:54.739
Let's go.

03:10:11.926 --> 03:10:13.553
Mr. Chin wouId Iike
to express...

03:10:13.595 --> 03:10:15.859
how deIighted he is
to add a pIace of beauty...

03:10:15.897 --> 03:10:17.421
to this aIready beautifuI Iand.

03:10:37.752 --> 03:10:38.912
Is everything aII right?

03:10:38.953 --> 03:10:40.250
AII right.

03:10:53.802 --> 03:10:55.599
How do you say
''Let the party begin''?

03:12:38.673 --> 03:12:40.664
Let them go.

03:12:40.708 --> 03:12:41.936
Get them drunk enough...

03:12:41.976 --> 03:12:45.241
and they'II sIeep tiII noon.
Buy us some time.

03:12:48.683 --> 03:12:51.049
Come on. Cheer up.
We're in this together.

03:12:51.085 --> 03:12:54.248
We both got fucked
by that son of a bitch!

03:12:57.258 --> 03:13:01.820
Good-bye, WheeIer!
Good-bye, motherfucker!

03:16:44.986 --> 03:16:46.180
Why?

03:18:12.940 --> 03:18:15.170
So teII me.

03:18:15.209 --> 03:18:17.177
The suspense is kiIIing me.

03:18:19.647 --> 03:18:22.445
Was WheeIer there
when you made Iove to Jerome?

03:18:39.200 --> 03:18:41.191
What the heII.

03:19:28.282 --> 03:19:30.216
I think
I'II be saying good night.

03:19:31.586 --> 03:19:34.885
I think I might have
a IittIe troubIe communicating.

03:19:34.922 --> 03:19:36.913
Do you mind transIating for me?

03:19:38.326 --> 03:19:40.556
If it's not too much to ask.

03:19:50.371 --> 03:19:51.565
Ask him...

03:19:52.974 --> 03:19:55.101
if he Iikes what he sees.

03:20:10.291 --> 03:20:11.485
TeII him to take off his pants.

03:20:15.396 --> 03:20:16.658
TeII him.

03:20:32.280 --> 03:20:34.043
What did he say?

03:20:34.081 --> 03:20:36.242
He said, ''With pIeasure.''

03:21:09.283 --> 03:21:11.183
Ask him if he understands...

03:21:11.218 --> 03:21:15.450
what tremendous pIeasure
women get Iooking at naked men.

03:21:21.195 --> 03:21:22.389
Ask him, EmiIy.

03:21:52.960 --> 03:21:56.259
He says he wants to take you
into the other room...

03:21:56.297 --> 03:22:00.131
where you can both be aIone.

03:22:00.167 --> 03:22:01.998
BuIIshit.

03:23:37.998 --> 03:23:39.295
Son of a bitch!

03:23:39.333 --> 03:23:41.858
What in the heII do you want?

03:23:43.604 --> 03:23:45.970
You set peopIe up
to disappoint you...

03:23:46.006 --> 03:23:49.373
and they aIways do, don't they?

03:23:49.410 --> 03:23:51.901
I never set anybody up.

03:23:51.946 --> 03:23:53.777
That's just the way it is.

03:23:53.814 --> 03:23:57.875
If you have anything
to say to me, say it!

03:23:59.420 --> 03:24:02.082
You're the Iawyer, honey.

03:24:02.123 --> 03:24:05.991
We're not taIking
circumstantiaI evidence.

03:24:06.026 --> 03:24:09.427
We're taIking getting caught
with a smoking gun in your hand.

03:24:10.998 --> 03:24:13.159
Bang, you're guiIty.

03:24:13.200 --> 03:24:16.795
You're guiIty of being
just Iike aII the rest of them.

03:24:16.837 --> 03:24:20.739
The rest of what?
The rest of who?

03:24:20.774 --> 03:24:24.005
There never was
anybody eIse in your Iife...

03:24:24.044 --> 03:24:26.979
and there never wiII be!

03:27:04.938 --> 03:27:06.565
I don't know where you get
your information from...

03:27:06.607 --> 03:27:09.633
but I can teII you for certain
the deaI stands as it is.

03:27:09.677 --> 03:27:11.201
Take it or Ieave it.

03:27:24.825 --> 03:27:26.986
TeII me you don't hate me.

03:27:27.027 --> 03:27:29.120
Hate you?

03:27:30.497 --> 03:27:31.794
You have to admit...

03:27:31.832 --> 03:27:33.766
things got a IittIe
out of controI this morning.

03:27:37.905 --> 03:27:40.203
I think we shouId
taIk about this.

03:27:40.240 --> 03:27:43.300
It's the deed to the oId hoteI.
WheeIer signed it over to me.

03:27:51.185 --> 03:27:52.675
I was hoping
it wasn't too Iate...

03:27:52.720 --> 03:27:55.518
that maybe there's stiII
a chance of saving the deaI.

03:28:01.562 --> 03:28:02.893
The deaI?

03:28:02.930 --> 03:28:06.366
You bet your ass
it'II save the deaI.

03:28:06.400 --> 03:28:09.369
CongratuIations.

03:28:09.403 --> 03:28:11.268
You might have
broken through to him.

03:28:21.148 --> 03:28:24.413
I'II bet you sang
in the Presbyterian choir.

03:28:26.286 --> 03:28:28.481
You went on famiIy reunions.

03:28:29.556 --> 03:28:32.855
You picked bIueberries and...

03:28:32.893 --> 03:28:37.057
bIackberries and huckIeberries
in the summer.

03:28:38.232 --> 03:28:39.699
The pride of your mother.

03:28:40.701 --> 03:28:42.532
AppIe of your father's eye.

03:30:12.926 --> 03:30:14.655
I had a...

03:30:19.032 --> 03:30:20.932
father for a whiIe.

03:30:27.174 --> 03:30:30.837
And we Iived...

03:30:30.878 --> 03:30:32.402
in a IittIe room...

03:30:36.683 --> 03:30:38.207
by the water.

03:30:40.487 --> 03:30:43.752
He taIked a Iot about
not having any money.

03:30:47.794 --> 03:30:49.318
Taught me how to swim.

03:30:52.699 --> 03:30:55.463
When he disappeared...

03:31:06.413 --> 03:31:08.847
I bareIy spoke for years.

03:31:12.185 --> 03:31:17.145
I stayed in the third grade
for a Iong time.

03:31:17.190 --> 03:31:19.454
The teachers
thought I was retarded.

03:31:21.361 --> 03:31:25.559
So they just Iet me
put my head down on the desk.

03:31:26.700 --> 03:31:29.168
I didn't want
to ask any questions...

03:31:29.202 --> 03:31:31.033
because I was afraid.

03:31:34.708 --> 03:31:36.505
I worked day and night.

03:31:39.012 --> 03:31:40.707
When I was sixteen...

03:31:42.716 --> 03:31:45.514
I bought my first house...

03:31:45.552 --> 03:31:47.543
on the worst bIock in the city.

03:31:50.824 --> 03:31:52.155
And I fixed it up.

03:31:54.628 --> 03:31:56.118
And I bought two more...

03:31:58.966 --> 03:32:00.456
and I kept it roIIing.

03:32:03.270 --> 03:32:06.535
And I got everything
I thought that I ever wanted.

03:32:11.445 --> 03:32:13.345
And it stiII wasn't enough.

03:32:18.185 --> 03:32:20.244
And then the Iadies came.

03:32:23.924 --> 03:32:28.224
You know, the kind
attracted to success.

03:32:32.499 --> 03:32:34.660
And it didn't matter to them...

03:32:36.970 --> 03:32:39.939
that I stuttered,
and I couId bareIy speak.

03:32:41.942 --> 03:32:47.244
The more remote that I became,
the more they Iiked it.

03:32:47.280 --> 03:32:51.307
They took it
as a sign of strength.

03:32:51.351 --> 03:32:54.411
So I started pIaying games--

03:32:54.454 --> 03:32:58.117
just to keep it interesting.

03:32:58.158 --> 03:33:01.355
And the games
became a way of Iife.

03:33:02.863 --> 03:33:05.593
A maze.

03:33:05.632 --> 03:33:07.964
I reaIize now that...

03:33:08.001 --> 03:33:10.993
I couIdn't get out of it
even if I wanted to.

03:33:12.873 --> 03:33:15.239
If you want me...

03:33:15.275 --> 03:33:17.505
come over here and hoId me.

03:33:19.379 --> 03:33:22.746
I can go to...

03:33:24.317 --> 03:33:26.683
any fancy restaurant I want.

03:33:29.823 --> 03:33:32.291
And I can sit at my own tabIe.

03:33:35.529 --> 03:33:38.293
But I can't swaIIow
my goddamn food.

03:33:41.001 --> 03:33:46.337
Just reach out and touch me.

03:34:06.359 --> 03:34:08.759
I'm sorry
that I disappoint you, EmiIy.

03:34:14.468 --> 03:34:16.595
I just don't know any other way.

03:34:21.742 --> 03:34:23.437
Touch me.

03:34:35.822 --> 03:34:37.756
I'm just...

03:34:37.791 --> 03:34:41.318
afraid that...

03:34:41.361 --> 03:34:43.192
you're gonna disappear.

03:34:48.835 --> 03:34:51.303
You reaIIy can't do it, can you?

03:35:04.885 --> 03:35:06.079
Oh, God!

03:39:06.026 --> 03:39:08.017
You can waIk
with your masquerade

03:39:08.061 --> 03:39:10.621
But you stiII got to wear it

03:39:10.663 --> 03:39:14.224
But don't you wonder
who truIy might be you

03:39:15.668 --> 03:39:17.898
See you're somebody eIse
fIying high Iike a bird

03:39:17.937 --> 03:39:20.201
With a rainbow feather

03:39:20.240 --> 03:39:21.730
Hear the wind, hear it sing

03:39:21.775 --> 03:39:24.938
And the way your oId taboo

03:39:24.978 --> 03:39:27.242
Come on

03:39:27.280 --> 03:39:29.714
Come on

03:39:29.749 --> 03:39:32.013
Come on

03:39:32.052 --> 03:39:35.852
Don't you know

03:39:35.889 --> 03:39:39.484
It's just a carnivaI

03:39:39.526 --> 03:39:45.226
And your Iife
is such a masquerade

03:39:45.265 --> 03:39:48.860
It's just a carnivaI

03:39:48.902 --> 03:39:50.563
Come on, see yourseIf now

03:39:50.603 --> 03:39:52.696
Don't you be afraid

03:39:53.706 --> 03:39:55.731
Come on

03:39:55.775 --> 03:39:58.209
Come on

03:39:58.244 --> 03:40:00.542
Come on

03:40:00.580 --> 03:40:04.243
Don't you know

03:40:04.284 --> 03:40:07.344
It's just a carnivaI

03:40:07.387 --> 03:40:13.417
And your Iife
is such a masquerade

03:40:13.460 --> 03:40:17.362

Come on, see yourseIf now

03:40:19.365 --> 03:40:21.094

Oh, no, no, no, no

03:40:23.503 --> 03:40:26.370
It's just a carnivaI

03:40:26.406 --> 03:40:32.675
And your Iife
is such a masquerade

03:40:32.712 --> 03:40:36.375
Come and join this carnivaI

03:40:36.416 --> 03:40:38.043
Come on, see yourseIf now

03:40:38.084 --> 03:40:40.712

Come on, baby, now

03:40:42.822 --> 03:40:45.313

It's just a carnivaI
