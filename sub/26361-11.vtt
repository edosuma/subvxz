00:04.526 --> 00:06.484
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:06.528 --> 00:07.833
sexually based offenses

00:07.877 --> 00:09.487
are considered
especially heinous.

00:09.531 --> 00:12.055
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:12.099 --> 00:13.926
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:13.970 --> 00:15.276
are members of an elite squad

00:15.319 --> 00:17.321
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.365 --> 00:20.020
These are their stories.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.124
- Gorgeous crowd.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.864
For the most part.

00:38.908 --> 00:42.259
-  No woman is ever
perfect enough for you, is she?

00:42.303 --> 00:47.221
- One is,
and I'm looking right at her.

00:48.526 --> 00:51.703
Mm.

00:51.747 --> 00:55.359
- Let's mingle.

00:55.403 --> 00:58.536
- Okay, so,
take some Blue Curacao,

00:58.580 --> 01:02.932
add it to your Moscow Mule,
and voilÃ , a Blue Mule.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.368
- I love it!

01:04.412 --> 01:07.023
- Yeah, it goes with
the theme of the party, girl.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.243
Drink your winter blues away.

01:09.286 --> 01:11.984
- My God, your friends
are so damn good looking.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.551
- Yeah, get on out there.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.510
Cuffing season is in
full swing, you know?

01:15.553 --> 01:17.381
- I mean just because it's cold
and people are lonely

01:17.425 --> 01:18.426
doesn't mean that
they're desperate

01:18.469 --> 01:20.950
to cuff up with some rando.

01:20.993 --> 01:25.041
Although, wow, he could make me
ignore my better angels.

01:27.348 --> 01:31.091
- Ah, thank you.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.614
- Where were we?
- Hm...

01:32.657 --> 01:36.096
- Ohh, last bad date,
Chinese guy with the boat.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.185
- Oh, God,
you have been listening.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.751
- Yeah, enough to know that
that guy

01:39.795 --> 01:41.101
brings nothing to the table.

01:41.144 --> 01:45.105
- Eh, his family's rich.
- Well, I'm broke.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.585
But I'm fun.

01:47.629 --> 01:51.415
- Hi there, are you the host?
- Yes, guilty.

01:51.459 --> 01:52.764
- Well, thank you so much
for having us.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.114
- My pleasure.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.159
- Here, let me help you
with that, uh...

01:56.203 --> 01:58.161
- Trina.
- I'll trade you, Trina.

01:58.205 --> 02:02.339
- Okay.
- These look interesting.

02:02.383 --> 02:04.515
- Oh, I love Italian reds.

02:04.559 --> 02:08.563
- Everything the French
brag about, but cheaper.

02:31.325 --> 02:34.676
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:34.719 --> 02:39.202
Just, um,
too many Moscow Mules.

02:41.161 --> 02:45.774
- My boyfriend's a doctor.
Let me get him.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.738
- Excuse me.
Sorry.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.179
Okay, everyone out.
Let's go.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.703
Bedroom's off limits.

03:01.746 --> 03:05.315
- My bad.
- I said everyone. Come on.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.535
Have you seen Ava?
- Who?

03:07.578 --> 03:09.014
- The girl
you were dancing with.

03:09.058 --> 03:12.279
Um, blonde, petite.
- So not as hot as you?

03:13.715 --> 03:17.719
- She was wasted.
I think she left.

03:35.302 --> 03:39.393
Help me.

03:39.436 --> 03:43.571
Help. Help me.
Help, please.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.529
Please.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.540
Hello?
Help.

04:00.675 --> 04:03.895
- Ugh.

04:03.939 --> 04:07.464
- Hello?
- You got the wrong house.

04:07.508 --> 04:11.729
- No! Wait, please.
Please...

04:11.773 --> 04:15.429
Please.
- What's wrong?

04:25.308 --> 04:29.007
Honey, what happened to you?

04:29.051 --> 04:31.358
- I was raped.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.447
- Bill?

04:33.490 --> 04:36.319
- I'll call 911.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.933
- Hey, Lieu, here you go.
Almond milk, no sugar.

04:41.977 --> 04:44.371
- Ah, you're the best.
So the victim was found

04:44.414 --> 04:46.242
wandering the streets
ringing doorbells?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.765
- Ava Parcell,
she's 30 years old.

04:47.809 --> 04:51.639
Tox screen showed MDMA,
Clonazepam, and BAC was .15.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.162
- Rape kit?
- Minor trauma.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.424
She had bruising in the thighs,

04:54.468 --> 04:55.730
semen in the throat
and her mouth.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.427
The lab is running DNA
right now.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.516
- Oh, my God, with
that level of intoxication,

04:59.560 --> 05:03.346
let's hope she knows
what planet she's on.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.130
- I don't do drugs, ever.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.958
- Okay, well, it's possible

05:07.002 --> 05:10.179
that he may
have slipped you something.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.355
- Like, in my drink?
- Maybe.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.966
Do you remember
where you were last night?

05:15.010 --> 05:18.796
- Yeah, my new boss, Trina,
had a party at her loft.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.452
I had a few Moscow Mules.
- Okay, were you with anyone?

05:22.496 --> 05:25.542
- This guy, Lee.
We were dancing.

05:25.586 --> 05:30.025
My body started
to feel heavy and hot.

05:30.068 --> 05:31.983
- Do you remember
what happened next?

05:32.027 --> 05:33.463
- I went to the bathroom.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.813
I thought I was going
to throw up.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.555
Then after that,
everything just got fuzzy.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.471
- Ava, you said
that you were assaulted.

05:41.515 --> 05:44.605
Do you have any idea
where or when that was?

05:44.648 --> 05:47.172
Was--was it at the loft party?

05:47.216 --> 05:49.653
- I'm not sure.

05:49.697 --> 05:54.832
I woke up in a strange bed.

05:56.051 --> 05:59.489
My ankles were tied.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.927
I untied them
and then I just ran.

06:02.971 --> 06:05.800
- Can you remember
any other details, maybe?

06:05.843 --> 06:10.370
A noise, a sound,
a specific smell?

06:10.413 --> 06:13.373
- He smelled--he smelled sweet.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.505
Like--like Gucci Rush.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.028
It made me think
of high school.

06:17.072 --> 06:22.207
- That's helpful.
Was there--was there a woman?

06:22.251 --> 06:25.689
- No, oh, my God, it was hers.
It was hers.

06:25.733 --> 06:29.432
My hands were pinned down
and I couldn't move

06:29.476 --> 06:33.001
and they were taking turns.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.525
- They?

06:35.569 --> 06:39.355
- It was a couple.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.792
It was a man and a woman.

06:44.447 --> 06:48.408
They both raped me.

07:42.026 --> 07:46.378
- Oh, my God.
That's horrible.

07:46.422 --> 07:49.947
I found her purse and her phone
last night under the table.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.123
- Did you see
who Ava left with?

07:52.167 --> 07:56.040
- No, it was so crowded.
Friends, friends of friends.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.999
I don't even think I knew
half the people that were here.

07:58.042 --> 08:01.698
- So you didn't see her leave?
- No, sorry.

08:01.742 --> 08:04.832
- What about a guy named Lee?
- Lee Black?

08:04.875 --> 08:06.964
He didn't assault her.
- You sound pretty sure.

08:07.008 --> 08:12.579
- Yeah, because I am.
He was with me all night.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.363
- We're going to need
to talk to him.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.756
- I don't see why.

08:15.799 --> 08:19.586
- Ava said she was raped
by a couple.

08:19.629 --> 08:23.067
- You don't think that I'm--
Okay, look.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.417
Ava was long gone by the time
Lee and I hooked up

08:25.461 --> 08:27.768
and that was after 5 a.m.?

08:27.811 --> 08:29.117
- Well, do you remember
Ava hanging out

08:29.160 --> 08:30.553
with any other
couples at this party?

08:30.597 --> 08:32.207
- Yeah, there was this--
this one couple.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.643
I didn't really know them.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.515
Um, I think the guy
said he was a doctor.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.212
- Did you get a name?

08:37.255 --> 08:39.649
- No, but they did bring
a bottle of wine.

08:39.693 --> 08:42.173
I saw that it was
expensive so...

08:44.306 --> 08:47.222
I hid it.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.356
- Lee Black.
He's an unemployed actor.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.010
Tox screen shows
MDMA and cannabis.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.708
- But he's not the one
who assaulted Ava?

08:54.751 --> 08:56.057
- His DNA was not a match.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.841
- Okay,
so we're back to square one.

08:57.885 --> 09:00.627
- Okay, but maybe--maybe not.
The Calloway-Crowne,

09:00.670 --> 09:02.193
they ID'd all the buyers

09:02.237 --> 09:04.152
of their $500 Barbaresco
in the last week.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.588
There was a web order
shipped to Connecticut,

09:05.632 --> 09:06.894
a delivery to Brooklyn,

09:06.937 --> 09:08.678
and an in-store
purchase yesterday.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.680
The name on the credit card
is Dr. Heath Barron.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.247
- The woman who threw
the loft party,

09:12.290 --> 09:13.683
she said the guy was a doctor.

09:13.727 --> 09:17.121
- Right. Not just "a" doctor:
Dr. Heath Barron.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.906
He's a
celebrity plastic surgeon.

09:18.949 --> 09:21.125
"Mr. Mommy Make-Over."
He does reality TV.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.388
He's a regular
on the talk show circuit.

09:23.432 --> 09:26.174
And this is his girlfriend,
Sadie Parker.

09:26.217 --> 09:29.046
She owns Sadie's Sugar Shack.
Designer cupcakes.

09:29.090 --> 09:32.223
- Okay, so let's see
if Ava can make an ID.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.664
- That's him.
The guy from the party.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.143
- You sure?
You--you recognize him?

09:39.187 --> 09:42.103
- Yes, that--
he looks so familiar.

09:42.146 --> 09:44.322
- Is it possible
that you've seen him on TV?

09:44.366 --> 09:47.848
- No, I don't watch TV.
He was definitely there.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.893
Trina said that he brought

09:49.937 --> 09:51.895
a way expensive bottle
of red wine.

09:51.939 --> 09:55.029
- And what about her?

10:04.473 --> 10:05.822
- She was so nice.

10:05.866 --> 10:09.434
She took me outside
when I was feeling sick.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.915
- Do you remember getting
in a car with those two?

10:11.959 --> 10:15.702
- Uh, maybe.
I don't know.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.791
- Okay, what do you--

10:17.834 --> 10:20.750
what do you remember
about them?

10:20.794 --> 10:23.840
- She gave me a drink
from her water bottle

10:23.884 --> 10:28.802
and after that
I went into a dark hole.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.717
But before I blacked out
she said

10:30.760 --> 10:32.675
that she was going
to go get her boyfriend.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.635
That he was a doctor.

10:38.899 --> 10:41.641
- Dr. Barron,
I'm Lieutenant Benson.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.121
- Ah, the big gun.
I'm impressed.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.167
- Sorry we, uh,
screwed up your lunch.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.952
- Ah, I wasn't really
feeling sushi anyway.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.214
Come in.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.652
So I'm sure we could
put this to bed quickly.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.872
About last night,
uh, what can I say?

10:55.916 --> 10:58.353
Sex can become complicated.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.398
- Well, we're just trying
to figure out why

11:00.442 --> 11:02.705
Ava Parcell
would accuse you of rape.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.490
- Yeah, I would like to know
that, too.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.144
You can ask me anything.

11:07.188 --> 11:11.409
- Okay. Did you drug her?
- No.

11:11.453 --> 11:15.631
Actually, she offered
Sadie and me ecstasy.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.154
Sadie took a pill, I didn't.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.679
I had patients to see today...
- Okay.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.115
- Ava was into it.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.812
Can I talk to her?
Clear up the confusion?

11:22.856 --> 11:24.727
- Well,
she didn't seem too confused.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.687
- Well, she must be.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.514
- How did you meet
at the party?

11:29.558 --> 11:31.908
- We were drinking these
horrible blue drinks.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.605
We started sharing.

11:33.649 --> 11:34.998
- Sharing what?

11:35.042 --> 11:38.175
- She said I was pretty,
Heath was handsome.

11:38.219 --> 11:41.091
Uh, she mentioned she'd had
a bad three-way in college

11:41.135 --> 11:43.703
and that maybe
it was time to try again.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.793
- So, uh,
Ava was coming onto you?

11:46.836 --> 11:49.360
- Yes,
but I didn't mind.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.841
She wasn't into the guy
she was dancing with.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.801
I ran into her in the bathroom.
She was queasy.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.020
I took her outside
for some air.

11:57.064 --> 12:00.197
She offered me ecstasy.
I took it.

12:00.241 --> 12:01.590
- And then?

12:01.633 --> 12:05.202
- We started rolling.
We got handsy, we kissed.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.943
Then Heath found us.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.554
- Ava's tox screen showed
that she also had

12:09.598 --> 12:11.078
Klonopin in her system.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.950
- Huh.
That's a dangerous combination.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.560
- So you didn't
give that to her?

12:15.604 --> 12:18.955
- No, that would be against
any doctor's ethical code.

12:18.999 --> 12:22.219
No, we, uh,
we met, connected.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.787
She suggested
taking the party home.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.879
Sadie and I like to have fun
on our off hours.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.055
- Whose idea was it
to take her home?

12:32.099 --> 12:33.840
- Hers.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.580
She didn't
have to twist my arm.

12:35.624 --> 12:39.889
- And when you got here?
- Ava pulled me on top of her,

12:39.933 --> 12:41.630
then she told Heath
to tie her up.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.240
- Huh, the neckties.
So that was--

12:43.284 --> 12:46.113
that was her idea, too?
- Yes.

12:46.156 --> 12:49.029
We even had plans
to go to breakfast.

12:49.072 --> 12:52.119
When we woke up, she was gone.
Whatever she's saying--

12:52.162 --> 12:55.035
- She's saying
that she was raped.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.385
That she couldn't move,
she couldn't scream for help.

12:57.428 --> 13:00.257
That is what she's saying.

13:00.301 --> 13:03.086
- I met this woman for
the first time last night.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.915
She seemed cool but she was
obviously on drugs,

13:05.959 --> 13:07.917
acting out a sexual fantasy.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.050
She was using us.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.573
- Hm.

13:11.616 --> 13:15.925
- So, this is a regular thing,
picking up other women?

13:15.969 --> 13:18.928
-  Sadie and I have
been together forever.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.451
We're like
an old married couple.

13:20.495 --> 13:23.977
She jokes, "Add sugar
to maintain freshness."

13:24.020 --> 13:26.980
She's a baker.
That's why.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.896
- And Ava was the sweetener?

13:31.158 --> 13:33.943
- I have a public profile.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.772
I don't know anything about
this woman or her agenda.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.035
Is that on me?
Yes.

13:39.079 --> 13:42.691
Did I or Sadie assault her?
Absolutely not.

13:42.734 --> 13:43.953
And if she keeps this up,

13:43.997 --> 13:48.088
I'm going to have to call
my lawyer, okay?

13:53.920 --> 13:56.357
- You know, we've heard
this sex-games-gone-wrong story

13:56.400 --> 13:59.839
a hundred times before.
You buying it?

13:59.882 --> 14:03.799
- Well, Botox and Cupcakes?
Sounds tempting.

14:03.843 --> 14:08.717
- You would've?
- No, but I can dream, right?

14:08.760 --> 14:12.503
Dr. Barron, he's--he's
good-looking and he's nice,

14:12.547 --> 14:15.245
he's successful, and Sadie
looks like she just stepped off

14:15.289 --> 14:17.465
of a cover of some magazine,
right?

14:17.508 --> 14:19.554
I mean, if Ava's
into that sort of thing

14:19.597 --> 14:21.730
and you throw some vodka
and ecstasy in the mix?

14:21.773 --> 14:23.210
- I get it.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.125
- Hi.
- Ava.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.518
Hey, uh, why don't you
step into my office?

14:27.562 --> 14:29.738
- Yeah, can I get you coffee
or anything?

14:29.781 --> 14:32.001
- No, I'm fine.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.916
So what are they saying?

14:33.960 --> 14:39.400
- Well, they're claiming that
the three-way was consensual.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.576
- Consensual?
No.

14:41.619 --> 14:45.101
- They also said that
you gave them the drugs.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.234
- I told you
that I don't do drugs,

14:47.277 --> 14:49.279
so, no,
I didn't drug them.

14:49.323 --> 14:50.846
Do you believe them?

14:50.890 --> 14:53.588
- We're just trying
to figure out what happened.

14:53.631 --> 14:56.678
All right, there were
three people in that room

14:56.721 --> 14:58.810
and two of them are saying
that you're lying.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.682
- I'm not lying.
- Okay, well, Sadie also said

15:00.725 --> 15:03.424
that you'd had
a three-way in college.

15:03.467 --> 15:06.035
Maybe you wanted
to try it again?

15:06.079 --> 15:09.430
- Even if I wanted to try it
again, I did not want this.

15:09.473 --> 15:12.607
Oh, my God.
You don't believe me?

15:15.001 --> 15:18.221
I did not want this.

15:18.265 --> 15:21.964
They raped me!
- Okay.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.357
- Okay, what?
What are you going to do?

15:23.400 --> 15:24.967
Are you going to arrest them?

15:25.011 --> 15:27.622
- We are going to build a case
and we're going to start

15:27.665 --> 15:30.233
by getting a search warrant
for their apartment.

15:30.277 --> 15:33.149
Okay?

15:38.763 --> 15:41.375
- There must be a lot of
beautiful people in this city.

15:41.418 --> 15:45.901
- Couldn't pay me to
inject poison in my face.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.991
Damn,
it's like a pharmacy in here.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.994
Codeine, Oxy, Xanax, Ambien.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.822
All prescribed to her by him.

15:53.865 --> 15:56.216
- Perks of living with
a doctor--nothing illegal.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.827
- Yeah, but you don't stash
your non-prescription drugs

15:58.870 --> 16:00.698
in your medicine cabinet.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.267
He's got some weed over here,

16:04.311 --> 16:06.313
but he's got a prescription
for this, too.

16:06.356 --> 16:07.749
- Ey, whatever happened

16:07.792 --> 16:09.620
to bottles of champagne
and candles?

16:09.664 --> 16:11.840
- You don't really want me
to answer that, do you?

16:11.883 --> 16:14.843
- No, I don't.

16:21.328 --> 16:24.896
- Hey, I got some
thumb drives over here.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.682
Look at this.

16:27.725 --> 16:30.293
- Number 12.
Jane, Mary, Jenny,

16:30.337 --> 16:32.904
Nita, Melissa, and Ava.

16:32.948 --> 16:36.517
- Ava ever mention
being recorded?

16:39.520 --> 16:42.218
- You like watching, babe?

16:42.262 --> 16:46.396
- You know I do.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.007
- What about you, sweetheart?

16:48.050 --> 16:50.400
- Ava is clearly unconscious.
That's Rape One.

16:50.444 --> 16:51.793
- We found dozens more,

16:51.836 --> 16:53.534
all labeled with girls'
first names and dates.

16:53.577 --> 16:54.970
- Going back ten years.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.450
- Lots of dilated pupils.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.929
- And Ava's the first
to complain?

16:57.973 --> 16:59.366
- We could be looking
at a lot of victims here.

16:59.409 --> 17:00.932
- Well, let's start with one.

17:00.976 --> 17:04.414
Pick up Sadie and Barron
for the rape of Ava Parcell.

17:08.636 --> 17:10.333
- Looking for
Dr. Heath Barron.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.161
- Aren't we all?
Get in line, honey.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.555
- Hey, where the hell is he?

17:14.598 --> 17:17.079
- He's in a private booth.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.955
- Mm, yeah.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.609
- Excuse me, Dr. Barron?

17:25.653 --> 17:27.698
- Uh, is there a problem,
detectives?

17:27.742 --> 17:29.483
I know you searched our house.

17:29.526 --> 17:32.399
All the drugs were legal.
You could have just asked.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.575
Look, I've been
accommodating, polite.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.098
I know you're just
doing your jobs

17:36.142 --> 17:37.404
but this is getting irritating.

17:37.447 --> 17:38.927
- Oh, it's getting irritating?
- Yeah.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.494
- Heath, can they do this?

17:40.537 --> 17:42.365
- It'll be all right, Sadie.
I'm calling my lawyer.

17:42.409 --> 17:43.497
- You know what?
That is a good idea,

17:43.540 --> 17:44.846
because you're both
under arrest

17:44.889 --> 17:46.891
for the rape of Ava Parcell.
- What?

17:46.935 --> 17:48.415
- So three-ways
are illegal now?

17:48.458 --> 17:51.418
I thought this was New York,
not Texas.

17:51.461 --> 17:52.941
- The tyranny of the parochial,
babe.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.464
It's everywhere.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.951
- You arrested my client
because a party girl

18:02.994 --> 18:05.171
enlisted him and his girlfriend
for a threesome?

18:05.214 --> 18:06.520
What am I missing?

18:06.563 --> 18:08.522
- The video we have
of our witness.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.393
She's passed out
in your client's bed,

18:10.437 --> 18:11.525
incapable of consent.

18:11.568 --> 18:12.917
- Yeah, you and your girlfriend

18:12.961 --> 18:14.832
got quite a collection
of sex tapes, Heath.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.878
If watching sex is now illegal,

18:16.921 --> 18:18.836
you're going to have to arrest
90% of the country.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.317
- Well, that's a good point,
but some of your victims

18:21.361 --> 18:22.797
were too high to consent.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.627
- That woman is unconscious.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.324
- She's not unconscious.

18:28.368 --> 18:31.762
She's pretending
to be unconscious.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.242
He name is Melissa Nochack.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.810
She fantasized about
being a living doll.

18:35.853 --> 18:38.117
- So what, you can just do
whatever you want with her?

18:38.160 --> 18:40.467
- The important thing is
it's what she wanted.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.991
Don't judge it
until you've tried it.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.559
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, Detective?

18:45.602 --> 18:47.778
Two women,
both melting under your touch,

18:47.822 --> 18:50.651
every erotic sense in your body
churning and churning

18:50.694 --> 18:52.827
until they all explode
simultaneously

18:52.870 --> 18:56.265
in total mental
and physical ecstasy?

18:58.876 --> 19:01.792
- You got a number
for this Melissa Nochack?

19:01.836 --> 19:05.056
- So do you tape
all of your threesomes?

19:05.100 --> 19:06.057
- I like to watch.

19:06.101 --> 19:09.322
- You do more than watch,
Sadie.

19:13.413 --> 19:15.066
- That's Jenny Abrams.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.591
- And she looks like she's
in quite a bit of distress.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.984
- Oh, she was orgasming.

19:20.028 --> 19:23.858
It was a big one.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.774
- They say if you put photos
side by side

19:26.817 --> 19:29.646
of people in pain
and people orgasming,

19:29.690 --> 19:32.214
it's hard to
tell the difference.

19:34.260 --> 19:37.001
Have you ever made love
to a woman?

19:42.442 --> 19:44.922
Oh, I--I know you want to.

19:44.966 --> 19:47.098
You want someone
who understands you.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.971
Your needs, your fantasies,
your body.

19:50.014 --> 19:53.322
Someone with gentle lips and
a curious and generous tongue

19:53.366 --> 19:56.107
searching your mouth while
a man takes you hard, rough--

19:56.151 --> 19:59.285
- No, that's okay.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.547
- Sadie, are you aware

20:00.590 --> 20:02.244
that your boyfriend
brought a lawyer?

20:02.288 --> 20:05.769
- I don't need a lawyer.
- Did he tell you that?

20:05.813 --> 20:08.816
- I have nothing to hide.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.471
- They got an answer
for everything.

20:11.514 --> 20:12.863
- So did Ted Bundy,
until he didn't.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.082
- They were forthcoming
about details

20:14.125 --> 20:15.736
I wouldn't want
to get into.

20:15.779 --> 20:16.780
- Yeah, and they know
we're going to check.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.739
- So we check all of them.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.262
Talk to each
of the women they named

20:20.306 --> 20:24.397
and anyone else you can
find from the tapes.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.137
- Yeah, that's me.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.966
- Uh, Jenny, I'm not trying
to embarrass you here, I just--

20:29.010 --> 20:30.838
I need to know if what happened
on this night

20:30.881 --> 20:35.190
was consensual or not.
It's--it's fine if it was.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.409
- It was.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.149
- Did you know
that they were filming you?

20:38.193 --> 20:41.240
- Sure.
We watched it together after.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.590
- You seem pretty out of it
on the video, Nita.

20:43.633 --> 20:46.680
- Wait, you watched me?

20:48.334 --> 20:49.596
Cool.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.598
- So this isn't
a regular thing?

20:51.641 --> 20:53.339
- I wouldn't tell you
if it was.

20:53.382 --> 20:56.429
Look, I'm an attorney
at a high profile firm.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.082
My private life
is my private life.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.780
- That's fair enough, Melissa.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.173
I just need to know if what
happened with Dr. Barron

21:02.217 --> 21:05.612
and Sadie Parker
was consensual.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.614
- So someone they've been
intimate with

21:07.657 --> 21:09.050
alleges it wasn't, right?

21:09.093 --> 21:11.966
Well, I can only speak
for myself,

21:12.009 --> 21:15.535
but we had a very
enjoyable evening.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.798
Can I go?

21:17.841 --> 21:21.062
- Okay, thanks, Peter.

21:21.105 --> 21:24.457
Heath and Sadie have been
arraigned and released R.O.R.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.415
- Of course they were.
- These guys are Teflon.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.461
We couldn't find anybody else
to say anything bad about them.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.071
- We've still got Ava.

21:30.114 --> 21:32.160
- Whose story will be a lot
less compelling to a jury

21:32.203 --> 21:33.857
after they hear
the other girls.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.338
- Okay, so keep looking.
Somebody's got to step up.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.774
- Or not.

21:37.818 --> 21:40.168
Heath and Sadie
obviously aren't worried.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.823
- Now there are some very
troubling allegations

21:42.866 --> 21:46.000
against you, specifically that
you've had non-consensual sex

21:46.043 --> 21:47.349
with a number of women.

21:47.393 --> 21:50.091
- Yeah,
and they are all 100% false.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.353
- Oh, they're going
on the offensive.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.007
This must have
been aired this morning.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.487
- You have one of
the most successful

21:54.530 --> 21:57.011
plastic surgery
practices in the city.

21:57.054 --> 21:59.143
- Well, thank you.
- So what's going on?

21:59.187 --> 22:00.841
- Look, I certainly would have
preferred to have kept

22:00.884 --> 22:03.452
my sex life private
but, uh, yes.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.236
The fact is,
I enjoy having sex

22:05.280 --> 22:07.500
with my girlfriend
and our friends.

22:07.543 --> 22:10.285
- And what about you, Sadie?
Are you up for this?

22:10.329 --> 22:13.941
- Frankly, it was my idea.
It's normal, what we do.

22:13.984 --> 22:16.117
- Isn't she beautiful?

22:16.160 --> 22:19.207
Look, I think in this one
instance, Ava--uh, sorry--

22:19.250 --> 22:22.515
this young woman got
embarrassed after the fact,

22:22.558 --> 22:23.516
which is a shame.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.518
- They're liars.

22:25.561 --> 22:26.910
- Ava.
- I-I saw it.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.390
My phone has been
ringing off the hook.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.826
They're making me out
to be the bad guy.

22:29.870 --> 22:30.827
The--the prude.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.220
- You're not a prude,

22:32.263 --> 22:34.004
because you didn't
want to be assaulted.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.050
Listen to me.
You just put that

22:36.093 --> 22:38.052
out of your head.
That's--that's false.

22:38.095 --> 22:40.359
- I'm being vilified
on TV, online.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.100
They're saying that
I am doing this for a payoff.

22:43.144 --> 22:45.276
- Okay, just--just--
let's--let's take a breath.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.453
- You know, let's just drop
the whole thing.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.977
I don't want to press charges.
I'm done.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.370
- Ava,
they're going to keep going.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.546
There's going to be more girls,
more victims.

22:53.589 --> 22:57.027
- Let them testify.

23:06.254 --> 23:08.822
- Hey, Lieu, I finally
got something on that S.O.B.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.041
I found an encrypted video
on the doc's computer.

23:11.085 --> 23:12.303
TARU enhanced it.

23:12.347 --> 23:16.133
It's, uh--
it's particularly vivid.

23:18.092 --> 23:21.400
The ending's no surprise.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.184
- She can't be more
than 14 or 15.

23:23.227 --> 23:24.620
- I don't think the feds
are going to prosecute

23:24.664 --> 23:29.190
for possession of one video,
but look at this.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.497
Medical books.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.933
- You think that Barron
made this video?

23:32.976 --> 23:35.588
- Yeah. I sent that girl's
image to NCMEC.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.720
Now they matched it
through facial recognition.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.592
Her name is Ceci Taylor.
She went missing

23:39.635 --> 23:42.290
from Brooklyn 14 years ago.
That is one year before

23:42.333 --> 23:43.683
Heath Barron graduated
Stony Point Med.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.598
- That's two hours north
of the city.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.948
- Now, if we can just prove
that he shot this video there--

23:47.991 --> 23:50.211
- Go, go.

23:54.694 --> 23:57.000
- The Dean told me you were in
Heath Barron's class

23:57.044 --> 23:58.654
in med school, Professor.

23:58.698 --> 24:01.483
- Louise is fine.
My little Heath Bar.

24:01.527 --> 24:04.486
That's what I called him.
It was a long time ago.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.793
- So you two were close?
- Sure.

24:06.836 --> 24:09.926
How do I put this?
He wanted to be a lot closer.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.493
- But you didn't want that.

24:11.537 --> 24:14.322
- I was dating a guy with dirt
under his fingernails.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.802
Contractor.

24:15.845 --> 24:18.457
- How did Heath
handle rejection?

24:18.500 --> 24:22.243
- Let me count the ways.
Flowers, candy.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.332
Once I went to his place
to study.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.768
He had a five course meal
laid out

24:25.812 --> 24:28.902
including some
chichi bottle of Italian red.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.512
Cost more than my rent.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.861
- Do you remember
where his place was?

24:31.905 --> 24:33.341
- It's out near the lake.

24:33.384 --> 24:36.518
I live out that way
if you want to follow.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.091
- Oh, my God.

24:44.134 --> 24:47.268
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Taylor.

24:51.533 --> 24:55.232
- One day
Cecilia went to school

24:55.276 --> 24:58.627
and she never came home.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.109
That's not out there
on the Internet?

25:02.152 --> 25:04.633
- No, no, no, no.

25:04.677 --> 25:09.769
As far as we know, it's just
on one person's computer.

25:09.812 --> 25:11.553
- What the hey?

25:11.597 --> 25:13.816
Thank heaven
for the little things.

25:16.558 --> 25:19.430
She's dead, isn't she?

25:20.910 --> 25:23.304
- We don't know.

25:23.347 --> 25:26.176
- My wife and I didn't
raise her like that.

25:26.220 --> 25:27.613
Ceci was a good girl.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.571
Sure, she smoked a little weed.
Who didn't?

25:29.615 --> 25:33.401
But she told us about it.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.403
She and Ruth were so close.

25:35.446 --> 25:37.797
- Your wife?

25:37.840 --> 25:40.495
- Passed away last year.

25:40.539 --> 25:44.238
Hit by a drunk driver
on Nostrand Avenue.

25:47.415 --> 25:52.463
Ceci and Ruth
talked about everything.

25:55.249 --> 25:58.121
She was mostly happy
till high school.

25:58.165 --> 26:01.821
She told Ruth all about
her--her first crush,

26:01.864 --> 26:04.171
Rob Kurtz.

26:04.214 --> 26:06.695
You know how it is
with teen girls.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.828
She wasn't in
with the "in" crowd.

26:08.871 --> 26:13.702
So she assumed it was
because she wasn't...

26:13.746 --> 26:16.879
pretty.

26:16.923 --> 26:19.578
There was nothing
we could do or say

26:19.621 --> 26:22.102
to convince her otherwise.

26:24.147 --> 26:28.412
Rob's a lawyer now out in LA.

26:29.849 --> 26:32.765
- Mr. Taylor...

26:32.808 --> 26:37.421
I know how difficult this is.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.989
Is it possible that Ceci ever--

26:40.033 --> 26:43.776
ever tried to get ahold
of you via text or via email?

26:43.819 --> 26:48.345
Maybe--maybe the phone rang
and no one was there?

26:48.389 --> 26:51.610
- Believe me,
we prayed every night

26:51.653 --> 26:55.352
for a sign she was alive.

26:55.396 --> 26:59.661
Seven years ago
on Ceci's birthday,

26:59.705 --> 27:02.403
Ruthie and I
had a fake funeral.

27:05.014 --> 27:09.018
Father John said it would
give us some kind of closure.

27:11.499 --> 27:14.633
There's no such thing
as closure.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.595
What the hey?

27:20.639 --> 27:23.859
Maybe it's a good thing
Ruthie's gone.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.523
- Come on, girls, here we go.
Coo, coo-coo-coo.

27:35.566 --> 27:38.482
- Excuse me.
- Huh? Hmm?

27:38.526 --> 27:40.615
Oh, can I help you?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.878
- Sergeant Tutuola,
Detective Carisi.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.837
Can we talk to you
for a minute?

27:44.880 --> 27:46.882
- Is something wrong?
- We just want to ask you

27:46.926 --> 27:48.841
about somebody
who used to live here.

27:48.884 --> 27:51.017
Heath Barron?

27:52.583 --> 27:54.368
- Yeah.
Oh, please.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.022
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.372
Yeah, so my husband and I
just split up.

27:58.415 --> 27:59.721
- Sorry to hear that.

27:59.765 --> 28:04.508
- Ugh, Noel ran off
with our lawyer's assistant.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.772
This house
just had too many memories.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.730
My sister asked me to move in
with her in Philly.

28:08.774 --> 28:11.037
That's where we grew up.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.995
And Heath was the first person
to answer the ad,

28:13.039 --> 28:14.649
so I rented it to him.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.174
- Mrs. Kimbel, um, did anybody
ever move in here with Heath?

28:18.218 --> 28:21.743
- You mean like a girl?
- That's exactly what we mean.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.615
- I doubt it.
- Why's that?

28:24.659 --> 28:26.487
- When he came to look
at the place,

28:26.530 --> 28:28.271
we had a cup of coffee
and a long talk,

28:28.315 --> 28:31.405
and he told me he was fixed
on this med student,

28:31.448 --> 28:34.103
but she was living with another
guy who worked construction.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.236
So I told him
about girls like that,

28:36.279 --> 28:39.239
girls who prefer men with
calluses on their hands

28:39.282 --> 28:41.589
to grey matter in their heads.

28:41.632 --> 28:44.679
I'm a girl like that.
Look where it got me.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.899
- Does this house
have a basement?

28:46.942 --> 28:49.336
- Yeah.
- Can we take a look?

28:49.379 --> 28:51.642
- Yes, of course.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.171
- He shot the video
right there.

28:58.214 --> 29:01.130
- Let me see it.

29:03.829 --> 29:06.266
Mrs. Kimbel, did you do
any remodeling down here?

29:06.309 --> 29:07.746
- No, never.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.444
- So you didn't replace
any of these panels?

29:10.487 --> 29:13.360
- Actually,
I never noticed that before.

29:17.146 --> 29:18.800
- Mrs. Kimbel,
would you do me a favor

29:18.844 --> 29:20.410
and wait for us upstairs?

29:20.454 --> 29:23.413
- Oh, sure.

29:40.691 --> 29:43.085
- Guess we know what happened
to Ceci Taylor.

29:43.129 --> 29:47.698
- Seven years for child porn.
Murder he goes away for life.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.052
- Oh, my God!

29:59.319 --> 30:01.669
- He covered the body in lye
to stop the smell.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.018
- Something a med student
would know.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.063
- Well,
he's not just a perv anymore.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.499
He's a perv murderer.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.806
- Guys, let's--let's not get
out ahead of our skis.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.546
- Let's not get ahead
of our skis?

30:09.590 --> 30:12.636
Lieutenant, no disrespect but
we got a little girl on video.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.073
We got a little girl's bones.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.944
From where I'm standing,
two plus two equals four.

30:15.988 --> 30:18.033
- And sometimes it doesn't.

30:18.077 --> 30:20.819
The ME ran the DNA
from the bones in the bag

30:20.862 --> 30:24.823
against a sample from a hair
brush that her father gave us.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.302
It doesn't match up.

30:26.346 --> 30:29.740
- The body in the bag
is not Ceci Taylor?

30:29.784 --> 30:32.265
- Not if you believe science.

30:32.308 --> 30:36.356
- Maybe that new video of Ceci
will convince Ava to testify.

30:38.358 --> 30:41.317
- That video
was very convincing.

30:44.451 --> 30:48.759
Maybe it'll convince
someone else.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.462
Thanks for coming in, Sadie.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.812
- I didn't really have
a choice, did I?

30:57.856 --> 31:00.946
- No, you didn't.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.338
- I actually feel sorry
for Ava.

31:02.382 --> 31:05.472
Sex shouldn't be
a shameful thing.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.691
Heath's lawyer says
she doesn't want to testify.

31:07.735 --> 31:11.260
- Well, not everyone's
as open as you are.

31:11.304 --> 31:15.177
But I actually didn't want to
speak to you about Ava.

31:15.221 --> 31:18.050
Why don't you have a seat?

31:18.093 --> 31:20.269
- Is someone else telling
more lies about us?

31:20.313 --> 31:22.837
- I wanted to talk to you
about a video

31:22.881 --> 31:26.754
that Heath kept hidden
on his computer.

31:26.797 --> 31:31.237
Yeah, I wondered why he didn't
want you to see this one.

31:34.588 --> 31:36.459
- Her name is Ceci Taylor.

31:36.503 --> 31:38.287
She was 14
when you recorded this

31:38.331 --> 31:40.811
so that makes you
a pedophile, Doc.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.552
You think that's me?

31:42.596 --> 31:44.032
Oh, for God's sakes.

31:44.076 --> 31:45.947
Somebody emailed it to me.
- And you kept it.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.036
- It was years ago.
I forgot about it.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.603
I have no idea who made that.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.431
- That's weird,
because it was recorded

31:51.474 --> 31:53.781
when and where you
lived during med school.

31:53.824 --> 31:55.565
The odds are pretty good
that, uh,

31:55.609 --> 31:57.524
that you're telling
a little white one here.

31:57.567 --> 32:00.570
- Pretty good doesn't cut it
in a criminal trial, Detective.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.138
- I'm sorry, how do you know

32:03.182 --> 32:04.879
where I lived
during medical school?

32:04.923 --> 32:08.361
- I'm glad you asked me that.
Your old classmate, Louise,

32:08.404 --> 32:10.667
took my colleagues there.

32:10.711 --> 32:15.020
Yeah, did you know Louise
teaches at your alma mater now?

32:15.063 --> 32:16.456
- You spoke to Louise?

32:16.499 --> 32:18.414
- Yeah.
Looks like somebody

32:18.458 --> 32:20.286
might still be
carrying a torch.

32:20.329 --> 32:22.897
Please, that's ridiculous.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.421
- That's one possibility.

32:25.465 --> 32:28.772
The other possibility is that
you've been looking

32:28.816 --> 32:30.557
for Ms. Louise
ever since she walked out

32:30.600 --> 32:35.344
of your five course
Italian feast 14 years ago.

32:35.388 --> 32:38.434
- We also found this
at the house.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.784
Now my guess
is that's another one

32:40.828 --> 32:42.482
of your boyfriend's victims.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.267
You think Heath
killed somebody?

32:45.311 --> 32:46.660
- I do.

32:46.703 --> 32:52.840
A teenage runaway that he used
before he found Ceci.

32:52.883 --> 32:55.408
- She was a great substitute
for Louise for a minute,

32:55.451 --> 32:58.019
but then you got tired of her.
Enter Ceci.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.847
- And I suppose
I killed her too?

32:59.890 --> 33:01.805
- I'm thinking
we'll be digging up her bones

33:01.849 --> 33:03.982
sooner or later, yeah.

33:04.025 --> 33:07.594
- God.
What is it with you people?

33:07.637 --> 33:11.076
Do you hate sex
or are you just scared of it?

33:11.119 --> 33:14.035
We enjoy what's natural,
what's beautiful.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.515
You get your jollies
by turning it all

33:15.558 --> 33:17.386
into something
sick and criminal.

33:17.430 --> 33:21.086
- Truth be told, I couldn't
care less what you and Heath

33:21.129 --> 33:23.088
do in your private life,

33:23.131 --> 33:25.612
as long as nobody else
gets hurt.

33:25.655 --> 33:28.571
That's the only thing
that I'm concerned with.

33:28.615 --> 33:32.401
But somebody else did
get hurt, Sadie.

33:32.445 --> 33:35.491
Somebody ended up
in the wall of his house.

33:35.535 --> 33:39.017
Now I'm assuming that you
didn't know about that.

33:39.060 --> 33:42.281
- He's a healer,
not a killer.

33:42.324 --> 33:46.720
What the hey?
You'll never prove any of it.

33:51.768 --> 33:54.336
- Oh, my God.

33:55.555 --> 33:58.906
Oh, my God.

33:58.949 --> 34:01.082
You're Ceci.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.084
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:03.128 --> 34:06.870
- You're the girl
in this video.

34:06.914 --> 34:09.656
- You're crazy--look at her.
She looks nothing like me.

34:09.699 --> 34:10.874
- Of course she doesn't,

34:10.918 --> 34:13.790
because Dr. Heath Barron
took care of that.

34:13.834 --> 34:16.967
He got bored with Ceci,
so he turned her into Sadie?

34:17.011 --> 34:18.143
- Stop!

34:18.186 --> 34:19.709
- Stop?
Ceci, you were 14.

34:19.753 --> 34:23.148
You should have been out
shopping for prom dresses or--

34:23.191 --> 34:26.020
or gossiping with your friends
about Rob Kurtz.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.413
- I said stop!

34:27.456 --> 34:31.547
- He's in LA, by the way.
He's a lawyer there.

34:32.896 --> 34:36.291
Heath Barron stole
all of that from you.

34:36.335 --> 34:40.600
It's time for you to stop
protecting him.

34:40.643 --> 34:43.472
- You've never been in love,
have you?

34:48.129 --> 34:50.000
- But does he love you?

34:50.044 --> 34:51.350
- That's a stupid question.

34:51.393 --> 34:54.222
I'm everything to him.

34:54.266 --> 34:55.789
- Then why does he keep
inviting

34:55.832 --> 34:58.139
other women into your bed?

35:20.770 --> 35:23.686
- Her name is Moira.

35:23.730 --> 35:26.298
I met her at a bowling alley
in Brooklyn.

35:26.341 --> 35:28.778
It was raining.
I didn't have my umbrella.

35:28.822 --> 35:30.650
She said her friend
would drive me home.

35:30.693 --> 35:33.131
- But he took you
up to his lake house?

35:33.174 --> 35:35.872
- I thought it would be fun.

35:35.916 --> 35:39.137
- So what happened to Moira?

35:39.180 --> 35:42.357
- One day I woke up
and she was gone.

35:42.401 --> 35:45.621
He told me she went back home
to her mom.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.580
I saw him re-paneling the wall,

35:47.623 --> 35:49.147
but he said
it was a water leak.

35:49.190 --> 35:52.846
- Do you know what I think,
Ceci?

35:52.889 --> 35:55.240
I think that Moira

35:55.283 --> 35:58.243
didn't live up to his fantasy

35:58.286 --> 35:59.461
and so...

35:59.505 --> 36:01.550
He's not a killer.

36:01.594 --> 36:04.597
Oh, that's--
that's not what he is.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.295
- Maybe it was an accident.

36:07.339 --> 36:10.690
Maybe he didn't mean
to kill her.

36:10.733 --> 36:15.042
But whatever it was,
when he got bored with her,

36:15.085 --> 36:18.393
you became his fantasy girl.

36:18.437 --> 36:22.702
And then when
he got bored with you,

36:22.745 --> 36:27.315
he molded you into
what he saw as perfection.

36:27.359 --> 36:29.665
- No, no!
He loves me.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.494
- No, he loves the idea of you.

36:32.538 --> 36:35.497
The perfect beauty.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.586
But beauty fades, Ceci.

36:37.630 --> 36:41.068
Even the perfect beauty
that he created.

36:41.111 --> 36:45.725
That's why he brings
other women home to your bed.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.770
Because he's searching
for something

36:47.814 --> 36:53.254
that can never,
ever really exist.

36:57.345 --> 37:00.000
- Look,
women are fragile beings.

37:00.043 --> 37:02.394
They're tortured
by the what-ifs.

37:02.437 --> 37:04.526
What if I didn't
have that damn mole?

37:04.570 --> 37:05.962
What if my lips
were a little plumper?

37:06.006 --> 37:07.616
What if my breasts
were a little firmer?

37:09.139 --> 37:11.925
- I'm sure you know what I'm
talking about, Detective.

37:11.968 --> 37:15.581
I'm sure you've spent more than
one sleepless night wondering,

37:15.624 --> 37:18.410
"What if my body doesn't
return to where it was?"

37:18.453 --> 37:20.150
- We don't need
to talk about me.

37:20.194 --> 37:22.065
- Why not?
You're a woman.

37:22.109 --> 37:24.198
You have fantasies.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.592
I make those fantasies real.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.031
I do not kill little girls.

37:31.074 --> 37:34.252
- You don't care about
your patient's fantasies.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.210
You care about your own.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.690
But that's the thing
about fantasies.

37:37.733 --> 37:40.083
They're not going to be
about flesh and blood.

37:40.127 --> 37:42.651
They're never going to be real.
- Okay, you know what?

37:42.695 --> 37:44.392
I've heard enough of this.
Let's go home.

37:44.436 --> 37:46.742
- The only place you're going
is Rikers; sit down.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.614
- He's already been R.O.R.
- Yeah, for Ava's rape.

37:48.657 --> 37:53.401
Now he's looking at murder,
so I said sit.

37:55.969 --> 37:58.450
- Did you rape Ava Parcell?

38:00.800 --> 38:04.760
I know that you weren't in
control of what you were doing,

38:04.804 --> 38:07.807
and I know that you did
everything for him.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.940
- He needs me.
- Yes, he does.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.333
But you don't need to spend

38:12.377 --> 38:15.075
the rest of your life
in prison.

38:15.118 --> 38:19.340
So tell me what happened, Ceci,
and we can work out a deal.

38:22.169 --> 38:26.304
- We gave Ava a lot of drugs.
It's not like we hurt her.

38:27.130 --> 38:31.918
- Yes, you did.

38:31.961 --> 38:36.444
And you more than anyone
should know that.

38:37.489 --> 38:40.535
- I didn't mean to.
I just like being--

38:40.579 --> 38:43.582
- Being what, Ceci?

38:49.109 --> 38:52.330
Being beautiful.

38:58.074 --> 38:59.989
- She's so sad.

39:00.033 --> 39:03.558
- They were both searching for
something that didn't exist.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.997
- I'll testify.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.521
- Good.

39:09.564 --> 39:12.698
It's the right thing.

39:14.003 --> 39:16.441
- So Stone says
he'll work with Ceci

39:16.484 --> 39:18.486
if she testifies
against Barron.

39:18.530 --> 39:21.663
- NCMEC found two Moiras
missing in the time frame.

39:21.707 --> 39:25.188
- I would not want
to make those calls.

39:25.232 --> 39:26.538
- Mr. Taylor.

39:26.581 --> 39:29.323
- I came as soon as I could.
Is she okay?

39:29.367 --> 39:30.890
- She's a little rattled,

39:30.933 --> 39:32.935
but I'm sure
that this will help.

39:32.979 --> 39:36.504
This way.
Hey, can we open it up?

39:58.178 --> 40:00.746
Hi.

40:01.964 --> 40:03.444
- Ceci?

40:03.488 --> 40:05.751
- Daddy, I'm sorry.

40:07.535 --> 40:11.191
- Oh, baby.
Oh, baby, ohh.

40:11.234 --> 40:14.150
Oh, baby.
- I'm so sorry.

40:14.194 --> 40:15.587
- Oh, it's okay.

40:15.630 --> 40:19.112
Oh, it's okay.
Ohh.
