00:01.760 --> 00:02.800
'Previously...'

00:02.800 --> 00:05.640
Mrs Chambers went into
spontaneous labour 20 minutes ago.

00:05.640 --> 00:06.520
What about the baby?

00:06.520 --> 00:08.080
What about the baby?

00:08.080 --> 00:10.400
How do you find as to
the defendant Peter White?

00:10.400 --> 00:12.880
We find the defendant not guilty.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.400
With the valuations coming up,

00:14.400 --> 00:16.200
I just want to make sure
I get a clean shot.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.320
I mean, I'm innocent,
it's only fair.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.360
Pull the ripcord!

00:19.360 --> 00:20.880
Tonight, on St Elsewhere...

00:20.880 --> 00:24.000
I have not had a date
since...I can't remember.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.760
October 26th, 1983.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.560
You killed my baby!

00:28.560 --> 00:31.280
My baby! You killed my baby!

00:31.280 --> 00:33.360
I am a human garbage truck.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.800
You're really careful so no-one
ever finds out about it.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.080
I have never understood what goes on
inside that beautiful head of yours,

00:39.080 --> 00:40.200
if anything.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.680
Why are you saying this?  What?

00:41.680 --> 00:43.960
All I'm trying to do is get
this thing out in the open.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.560
We still have two cuts to make.

00:45.560 --> 00:49.360
The crux of this evaluation is
Morrison's clinical judgment.

00:49.360 --> 00:53.200
Listen, if this is about the cut,
I understand, you had no choice.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.200
I'm taking you to court, Westphall!

00:55.200 --> 00:59.200
They'll force you to give me
a second year! I'll be back!

02:45.280 --> 02:47.680
SAXOPHONE PLAYS

02:47.680 --> 02:50.440
I'm not coming back
for a second year, I can tell.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.840
Right now Auschlander,

02:51.840 --> 02:54.280
Westphall and Craig are upstairs
having a good yuk over

02:54.280 --> 02:57.560
my board scores, amazed that I'd
even think about staying here

02:57.560 --> 03:01.560
at St Eligius.

03:01.880 --> 03:02.960
Excuse me,

03:02.960 --> 03:05.080
do you mind?

03:05.080 --> 03:08.400
He's feeling kind of sad right now.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.160
SAD MUSIC PLAYS

03:10.160 --> 03:12.480
Oh, wonderful.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.840
Victor,
I think you are being paranoid.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.560
Say that one more time
and I'll kill you.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.760
Calm down!

03:17.760 --> 03:21.760
Calm down...

03:22.480 --> 03:25.200
The moment I turned in my last test
booklet, I knew I'd blown it.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.560
How many residents do you know
who think they aced it?

03:27.560 --> 03:29.600
Gibson, Egley, Darnell, you.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.640
Maybe, but...

03:30.640 --> 03:33.760
When I walked out of the exam room,
the moment I got outside, it hit me.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.760
Dizziness, muscle twitching,
drowsiness, convulsions.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.280
We all felt burnt out.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.440
That's not how I felt,
it's the answer to question 16.

03:41.440 --> 03:45.440
"Name the side effects
and toxicity of lidocaine."

03:46.200 --> 03:48.840
I don't know,
during the exam, I choked.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.720
Even if you did,
and I'm not saying that you did,

03:51.720 --> 03:54.200
Craig's evaluation will weigh
heavily in your favour.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.320
I'm not sure.

03:55.320 --> 03:59.040
Believe me, he'll take care of you,
he loves you. You are his underling,

03:59.040 --> 04:03.040
his protege, his hope
for cardiac care of the future.

04:03.240 --> 04:07.240
Good evening, Dr Craig.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.680
Maybe he didn't see you.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.240
Hi.

04:28.240 --> 04:31.040
Hi.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.440
I love to watch you work.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.800
Good.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.080
Is it going OK?

04:35.080 --> 04:37.280
Well, it's halftime.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.520
They're preparing
another skin graft.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.640
How are you feeling?

04:41.640 --> 04:42.680
Sick.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.120
You've got a fever?

04:44.120 --> 04:46.720
No. I'm just sick of school,
Joan, that's all.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.600
What you need is a vacation.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.600
OK, what do you got in mind,
another trip up to the Cape?

04:52.800 --> 04:55.360
I've got every sand dune
up there memorized.

04:55.360 --> 04:58.840
Um...Paris.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.280
OK, let's do it, tomorrow.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.480
Tomorrow? Bobby...

05:03.480 --> 05:06.040
Come on, Monday's a holiday,
we'll take Friday off.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.640
Fly to Paris to spend four days?

05:08.640 --> 05:09.240
Sure, why not?

05:09.240 --> 05:10.560
Sure, why not?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.520
What do you mean crazy?
What about the Louvre?

05:12.520 --> 05:15.280
You know, Tuileries Gardens,
Palace of Versailles?

05:15.280 --> 05:17.400
Summer of my freshman year
in college,

05:17.400 --> 05:20.960
backpacking with pals of mine -
hardly the way to see Paris.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.920
I've been dying to go back
with a woman.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.960
OK, what about travel plans?

05:24.960 --> 05:28.080
Hey, stop, wait a minute.
No plans, OK? Let's just do it.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.400
Do you want to see Paris or not?

05:30.400 --> 05:32.120
Who doesn't?

05:32.120 --> 05:35.320
OK, then were on.
We'll do it tomorrow.

05:35.320 --> 05:39.320
OK, what about plane tickets,
hotel reservations, passports?

05:39.320 --> 05:41.760
We renewed them, right?

05:41.760 --> 05:43.120
OK.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.480
Non-smoking section, aisle seat.

05:45.480 --> 05:49.480
Hotel - Frantel Windsor,
room with a view.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.600
As far as I am concerned,

05:51.600 --> 05:55.600
there's no place for a resident
like that at St Eligius.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.800
It seems that Dr Gates
is very popular with the staff.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.640
Oh, for the love of... Whose taffy
does he think he's pulling?

06:01.640 --> 06:04.200
The man is one affectation
after another.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.640
&lt; Is that supposed to make
a good surgeon? He's a caricature.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.280
(SIGHS)

06:09.280 --> 06:10.520
You OK?

06:10.520 --> 06:13.200
Is it just me

06:13.200 --> 06:16.080
or do these evaluations
take longer every year?

06:16.080 --> 06:18.080
Why don't we stop for tonight?

06:18.080 --> 06:18.840
What?

06:18.840 --> 06:19.880
What?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.120
We've only made two cuts,
we have three more to go.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.680
Look at all of these
we have to evaluate.

06:24.680 --> 06:28.000
Horton, Tom, Morrison,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.440
Rosen, Ehrlich. Ehrlich!

06:30.440 --> 06:32.480
It's a tough group to trim,
all right.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.040
Maybe the talent is getting better.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.120
I'd like to think it's
a tribute to our teaching.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.760
Well, look, what about Dr Gates?
Can we at least make the third cut?

06:39.760 --> 06:41.000
Good night, Mark.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.400
BEEPING

06:43.400 --> 06:45.080
Oh, all right!

06:45.080 --> 06:49.080
OK, the splenectomy was May, '82.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.120
The big boys still
sequestered upstairs?

06:54.120 --> 06:55.600
Just finished. &gt;

06:55.600 --> 06:57.480
Finished?

06:57.480 --> 07:00.000
Stopped, for the night.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I wish I could say the same.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.640
What? This must be the first time
in weeks you haven't been home

07:05.640 --> 07:06.960
for the seven o'clock news.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.720
At least you sleep straight through.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.000
Sure, hide behind the kid,
that's always a good excuse.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.960
If you're going to squabble,
don't do it here,

07:13.960 --> 07:17.400
some of us are working.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.400
Hey, what's up?

07:23.160 --> 07:24.200
You sent from me?

07:24.200 --> 07:26.480
I'm taking you out of Pathology.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.600
How come?

07:27.600 --> 07:31.600
Check with Luther in the morning,
he set up a place for you to work.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.760
Dr Westphall,
why are you moving me?

07:34.760 --> 07:36.360
I mean, at least have the decency...

07:36.360 --> 07:38.440
Don't talk to me about decency,
mister,

07:38.440 --> 07:42.440
you don't know what the word means.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.440
You know, Fiscus? I think
you take a very nice picture.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.560
Speaking of which,
I could really use your help.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.760
You know the rag I work for?

07:57.760 --> 07:59.040
The Examiner?  Yeah.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.360
Great sports section.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.400
Yeah. Well, I'm shooting
a fashion spread.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.120
It's called New Wave Professionals.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.280
(LAUGHS)

08:05.280 --> 08:06.640
It sounds like a punk group.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.080
Check out the subtitle.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.440
Boston's most eligible bachelors.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.280
Whoa, wait a second, you're not
asking me to pose for this, are you?

08:13.280 --> 08:14.320
Why not?

08:14.320 --> 08:16.520
I'm sorry, Goose,
this is bad timing.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.080
We just took the National Boards
and we're awaiting to hear

08:19.080 --> 08:21.200
about being in next year's
residency programme.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.280
Hey, look, I got an architect,
I got a lawyer, I got a banker,

08:24.280 --> 08:25.720
I even got one of the Bruins.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.000
Now, I had this dentist,
but he dropped out.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.440
He wouldn't work on Wednesdays.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.159
So, what I need is a hot,
young physician.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.679
You'll be doing a terrific favour.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.720
Yeah, pass.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.240
You'll earn 100 bucks.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.840
It's just that I'm
really busy right now.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.080
Look, when you see your kisser
splashed all over the style section,

08:42.080 --> 08:44.680
your phone is going
to be ringing off the hook.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.560
Women from every
imaginable walk of life.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.720
Lots of women?

08:48.720 --> 08:52.720
Stacks!

08:52.840 --> 08:54.280
Fill me in.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.480
His drop is below 30cc
per hour

08:57.480 --> 09:00.880
and pulmonary artery pressure -
22 over ten.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.360
Cardiac output - three to 3.5.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.920
Diagnosis?

09:04.920 --> 09:07.360
Her fluid intake is low.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.720
Hypovolemia?

09:08.720 --> 09:10.840
Course of action?

09:10.840 --> 09:13.000
Um...

09:13.000 --> 09:15.760
Turn up the IV and give her
500cc of plasmanate

09:15.760 --> 09:18.520
over the next 45 minutes.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.400
Then do it.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.040
Why did you call me down here?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.320
Well, you did her bypass,

09:24.320 --> 09:26.640
I thought you wanted to know
what was going on with her.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.320
This is all routine,
you didn't have to call me.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.960
She is 24 hours postop,

09:30.960 --> 09:33.400
I thought your instructions
might have changed.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.360
Isn't that why we keep charts?

09:36.360 --> 09:39.880
I have been tied up all day
evaluating residents for next year

09:39.880 --> 09:42.240
and there will be another full day
of it tomorrow.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.280
I understand...

09:43.280 --> 09:45.880
One of the qualities that we're
looking for in our doctors

09:45.880 --> 09:47.920
is simple common sense.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.400
It allows you to perform
your tasks with confidence.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.120
And competence.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.120
You'll do well in the future
to remember that.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.120
You better hurry up!

10:06.120 --> 10:08.040
I never missed a plane,
I'm not starting now.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.320
&lt; What time is it?

10:09.320 --> 10:11.360
6:15.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.960
The flight's at 7:30. I figure
traffic on the expressway

10:13.960 --> 10:16.600
will be pretty heavy
since it's a holiday weekend.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.640
Stop rushing, Joan.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.920
The idea is to get on a plane
in Boston and get off one in Paris.

10:20.920 --> 10:24.920
If you don't step on it,
we're not going to make it.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.160
What are you doing?

10:28.160 --> 10:29.840
Putting on my pants.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.400
Where is your underwear?

10:31.400 --> 10:32.440
I'm not wearing any!

10:32.440 --> 10:33.520
We're going through customs!

10:33.520 --> 10:35.160
We're going through customs!

10:35.160 --> 10:36.240
Bobby!

10:36.240 --> 10:38.200
Joan, remember, forget the details -

10:38.200 --> 10:40.520
time, money, underwear.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.240
Would you rather
I wear a pair of yours?

10:42.240 --> 10:43.480
Ha.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.200
&lt; (SCREAMS)

10:45.200 --> 10:46.440
Bobby, what's...?

10:46.440 --> 10:48.320
(MOANS)

10:48.320 --> 10:52.320
I'm stuck in my zipper.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.000
Ms Halloran, Bobby.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.480
Nurse Daniel said
you were a bit evasive

11:04.480 --> 11:08.480
as to what exactly the problem is.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.960
I zipped up my business end.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.600
Oh.

11:14.600 --> 11:18.600
Why don't you take off the sweater
so I can have a look?

11:22.760 --> 11:25.960
You mean to say there's not one
male doctor on call down here?

11:25.960 --> 11:27.320
I'll wear gloves.

11:27.320 --> 11:31.320
Shirley, give me a suture tray,
stat.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.520
I need to speak with you.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.040
Go away.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.520
Mrs Chambers.

11:55.520 --> 11:59.520
I'm sorry you lost the baby.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.680
Please, Mrs Chambers,
I can't sleep...

12:02.680 --> 12:05.120
I hope you never have
one minute of sleep.

12:05.120 --> 12:09.120
Or one bit of rest or peace
or happiness, cos I never will.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.760
I didn't know the baby
was in danger.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.760
I hope to God that you are punished
for what you've done!

12:16.800 --> 12:19.120
You killed my baby.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.040
You killed my baby!

12:21.040 --> 12:21.680
Listen to me...

12:21.680 --> 12:22.920
Listen to me...

12:22.920 --> 12:26.920
(CRIES)

12:32.680 --> 12:35.120
Victor, you worry too much.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.280
Oh, really?

12:36.280 --> 12:39.720
I feel the way I did before I got
cut from varsity basketball.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.520
I don't think Dr Craig cares if you
can hit from the top of the key.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.800
Come on, you know what I mean.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.640
I don't think you know
what you mean.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.440
OK, look, how can you tell
whether or not a coach likes you?

12:48.440 --> 12:50.720
I don't know.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.040
He gives me
a ride home after practice.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.240
No, I don't think so.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.000
What he'd do is give you
a swift kick right in the pants.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.360
Watch it, please.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.320
Even the orderlies
are out to get me.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.600
If a coach feels you have
potential as an athlete,

13:04.600 --> 13:08.280
he'll yell at you, take you aside,
knock you around, humiliate you.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.520
It makes you feel good,
kind of special.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.560
Of course.

13:11.560 --> 13:15.000
Craig hasn't done that lately,
and I know that means I am O-U-T.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
You mean he hasn't scolded
you in OR?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.760
Not the slightest admonition.

13:18.760 --> 13:19.800
No errand running?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.800
I can't recall the last time he sent
me to the lab for test results.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.680
Mm. No wisecracks
about your clothes?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.880
Nothing.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.880
You're in trouble, Ehrlich.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.720
This is the delousing room.

13:45.720 --> 13:49.720
Used to be. The pipes burst
and they shut it down.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.360
Fine.

13:53.360 --> 13:57.360
I know what they're up to.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.640
I'll get a radio and some plants.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.680
Look, there'll be
two more carts coming in.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.120
Put the finished folders here
and I'll take them down

14:05.120 --> 14:09.120
to Medical Records.

14:10.720 --> 14:13.840
Wait a sec, some of these doctors
haven't been around here in years.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.040
Most of them are dead.

14:15.040 --> 14:18.640
No-one has had time
to close out the cases.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.520
Westphall can do anything he wants,

14:20.520 --> 14:24.520
he is never going to break me down.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.600
(CRIES)

14:48.360 --> 14:52.360
(GAGS)

15:06.200 --> 15:08.800
I'm looking for Dr Kiley.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.520
I haven't seen her.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.920
Twinkies for lunch?

15:11.920 --> 15:15.920
I was on call all night,
I didn't have time for real meal.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.640
What is going on, Wendy?

15:17.640 --> 15:18.800
I was hungry.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.240
Yeah, but all my kids put together
couldn't eat that much junk

15:22.240 --> 15:26.240
and you never gain any weight.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.680
I am a human garbage truck.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.280
Double satisfaction.

15:34.280 --> 15:38.280
You stuff yourself and then you get
rid of it right away.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.520
I have a niece who is anorexic.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.120
It's totally different.

15:43.120 --> 15:47.120
You see, with anorexia,
you simply starve yourself.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.080
Bulimia is more insidious.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.120
You binge and then purge.

15:52.120 --> 15:56.120
You have to be really careful so
no-one ever finds out about it.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.640
Eating is almost like meditating.

16:01.680 --> 16:02.960
Food's my only friend.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.280
Wendy, that's not true.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.880
Would you call yourself my friend?

16:06.880 --> 16:08.600
Yes, I would. I don't know you
very well, but...

16:08.600 --> 16:12.600
Yes, I would. I don't know you
very well, but...

16:14.080 --> 16:17.600
I feel so apart
from everyone around me.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.680
Ms Perfect,
that's what Fiscus called me.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.800
Well, it's true, you know?

16:23.800 --> 16:26.920
It's what I've always tried to be -
perfect.

16:26.920 --> 16:27.960
The perfect student,

16:27.960 --> 16:31.960
the perfect lady, the model child,
the perfect doctor!

16:33.240 --> 16:36.480
The problem is you
are never perfect enough.

16:36.480 --> 16:40.160
See, you are never good enough.

16:40.160 --> 16:44.160
No matter what I ever did,
I always let my parents down.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.920
How come it's OK for guys
to look like slobs?

16:51.920 --> 16:55.000
Listen, Wendy.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.600
You need therapy,
some kind of counselling.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.600
Nowadays, there are all kinds of
experts on nutritional disorders.

17:04.119 --> 17:08.119
Don't worry about this, Helen,
I'm going to get over it myself.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.960
And I mean it this time.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.200
Well, you know,

17:11.200 --> 17:15.200
there are some things that you can't
always do all by yourself.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.200
I'm stupid to let this ruin my life.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.760
And I'm going to conquer it.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.040
You know what I want you to do?

17:23.040 --> 17:27.040
At least go and talk
to Dr Westphall about this.

17:29.520 --> 17:33.520
Maybe.

17:38.520 --> 17:42.520
Meanwhile, I don't want this
to leave the room.

17:43.480 --> 17:47.480
OK.

17:53.360 --> 17:57.360
I have patients
to see before rounds.

18:00.120 --> 18:04.120
The consensus is there is
an immature side to Victor Ehrlich.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.760
I suppose one might say
he's misguided.

18:07.760 --> 18:11.760
No wonder, growing up
with that wacko aunt of his.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.200
So then, any major objections?

18:17.400 --> 18:21.400
We still have two cuts to make.

18:21.480 --> 18:25.160
Jack Morrison.

18:25.160 --> 18:29.160
His board scores are abominable.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.800
I am pressed to think of a single
significant diagnosis

18:31.800 --> 18:33.280
he's made all year.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.120
Well, he certainly helped
that Singleton family.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.080
The fellow that brought his wife
back from the stroke, you remember?

18:39.080 --> 18:40.680
What did Morrison
have to do with it?

18:40.680 --> 18:44.000
Support. He made them both
feel that she could get better,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.800
and you know as well as I do that
a positive attitude from a doctor

18:46.800 --> 18:48.240
can make a very real difference.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.560
But it's not enough.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.560
What I'm saying is, given
the choice between a fine technician

18:53.840 --> 18:57.000
and a wonderful human being, I will
take the technician every time.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.840
I think you're both
missing the point.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.840
The crux of the evaluation is
Morrison's clinical judgment,

19:03.960 --> 19:06.360
his gut instinct
about what to do when.

19:06.360 --> 19:09.960
You wind him up,
he runs into a wall, he stops.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.960
Look at what happened
to the TIA patient. &gt;

19:14.160 --> 19:18.080
Morrison got so involved
with his family

19:18.080 --> 19:19.840
that he lost his objectivity

19:19.840 --> 19:21.760
and he couldn't ask
the hard questions.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.760
I get the sense sometimes
that he's rooting so hard

19:26.160 --> 19:30.160
for his patients that he's afraid
to face what is wrong with them.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.400
Yeah.

19:32.400 --> 19:36.160
But let's not forget how difficult
his personal life has been this year.

19:36.160 --> 19:39.000
His wife's death, trying to raise
little Pete on his own.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.520
I like him, personally.

19:41.520 --> 19:45.520
I mean, that's not the issue.

19:46.120 --> 19:50.120
What's the most you can say for him?

19:50.560 --> 19:52.440
He cares, Mark.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.440
He knows his own limitations.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.720
Dumb, Wayne, dumb.
Never trust reporters.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.760
Don't come crying to me
when they misquote you.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.280
They can't misquote me, I'm just
getting my picture taken.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.680
Be sure you get the negative.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.600
Ehrlich, you're looking
at a frustrated libido.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.360
I have not had a date since...
I can't remember.

20:09.360 --> 20:13.360
October 26th, 1983. 10:48pm.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.200
Thanks.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.520
Eastern Standard Time.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.960
Let me explain something to you.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.160
Hi, guys.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.720
Hi, Shirley. The press doesn't care
about you, OK?

20:21.720 --> 20:23.040
They're in it for themselves.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.200
Women reporters are writing
romances on the side.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.520
The men are walking around
with their shirt tails out,

20:27.520 --> 20:28.720
updating their resumes.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.040
This is a major
metropolitan newspaper.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.960
Great, you sound like Jimmy Olsen.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.800
I don't get it, Shirl,
what's with all this flack?

20:35.800 --> 20:38.600
Professional jealousy.
I'll bet Victor would die

20:38.600 --> 20:39.880
&lt; to see his face in the paper.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.280
Oh, no. Not this week.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.840
The question is,
do I get permission from Westphall?

20:44.840 --> 20:45.880
For what?

20:45.880 --> 20:47.520
It's your personal life,

20:47.520 --> 20:49.840
the hospital can't question
what you do on your time.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.560
That's right. I need this.

20:52.560 --> 20:56.040
I can see it now,
today the Boston Examiner.

20:56.040 --> 21:00.040
Tomorrow the National Enquirer.

21:00.680 --> 21:04.360
I want to read you something.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.760
"Thank you for sending
your medical record," etc.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.200
Who is this from?

21:08.200 --> 21:09.640
The DA in the rape case.

21:09.640 --> 21:13.080
Do you realise he didn't even tell
the jury how badly I was hurt?

21:13.080 --> 21:14.760
It is too late, Wendy.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.600
"Unfortunately, the basic principle
of double jeopardy..."

21:17.600 --> 21:21.240
He's saying that you can't try
someone twice for the same crime.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.320
I know, I know.
Just listen to this part.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.360
"I wish I could've helped you more.

21:26.360 --> 21:30.360
"Just remember, in our system,
justice is a process, not a result."

21:31.400 --> 21:33.200
What the hell does that mean?

21:33.200 --> 21:35.320
Don't criminals go to jail any more?

21:35.320 --> 21:39.320
Wendy, all I know is you have to
find a way to put this behind you.

21:39.520 --> 21:42.040
Sure, with Peter White working
right here in the building.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.400
It's strange, I know.

21:44.400 --> 21:48.400
For me,
the trial was a rite of passage.

21:49.080 --> 21:53.080
For the first time in ages,
I am excited about the future.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.160
What do you mean?

21:55.160 --> 21:57.080
I'm through with the morgue.

21:57.080 --> 22:01.080
I've had it with corpses,
with formaldehyde.

22:01.160 --> 22:04.560
With death.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.680
I'd give anything to feel that way.

22:06.680 --> 22:10.680
The worst has already happened
and we are still alive.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.360
Ladies and gentlemen, Hoot Gibson!

22:18.360 --> 22:19.440
Thanks, Helen.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.520
Dr Caldwell.

22:20.520 --> 22:23.240
I don't know if you're coming
back for a second year, don't ask.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.040
It just so happens
I want to do you a favour.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.600
Yeah? What's that?

22:26.600 --> 22:29.000
I want to give you some advice
on how to keep under control

22:29.000 --> 22:30.720
so your sutures will stay in place.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.160
Mind your own business, Victor.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.640
I just want to help.
I know what you are going through.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.880
Everybody has got to wind
the watch once in a while.

22:36.880 --> 22:37.920
Bye, Victor.

22:37.920 --> 22:41.040
OK.

22:41.040 --> 22:45.040
Gives me the willies.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.920
Goose.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.840
Hey, at last, the medic.

22:55.840 --> 22:59.000
Nicki, have you met
Boston's most eligible doctor?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.160
Yeah.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.320
These are amazing.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.720
Are they all yours?

23:03.720 --> 23:07.600
Oh, yeah.
Take a seat up on the stool.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.400
You know, I don't know why
picked that architect,

23:10.400 --> 23:12.840
he kept throwing me
his profile all the time.

23:12.840 --> 23:15.200
Nicki, fix Wayne's hair.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.440
My hair?

23:16.440 --> 23:19.920
I thought you were interested
in the real me.

23:19.920 --> 23:20.960
(LAUGHS)

23:20.960 --> 23:23.760
That hairstyle went out with
Elliott Gould in Getting Straight,

23:23.760 --> 23:27.600
the worst movie ever made.
We're going to slick you down.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.480
And take off his sweater, Nicki.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.880
Yes, that's much better.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.240
We're going to do some
wardrobe stuff, too.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.680
And, Nicki, two feet back.
Thank you.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.840
Wayne.

23:38.840 --> 23:41.360
Yes, that's outstanding.
That's enough prep.

23:41.360 --> 23:44.280
Nicki, let's get him
into his first outfit.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.000
What kind of outfit?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.120
Look at that.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.760
That's Khe Sanh in '67. Yes sir,

23:50.760 --> 23:52.400
you were my very first headache.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.880
OK, I am ready on the firing line.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.440
Firing line?

23:56.440 --> 23:58.080
Come on, smile.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.760
This is an outfit?

23:59.760 --> 24:01.240
Outstanding.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.600
If we would've had this meeting
six months ago,

24:03.600 --> 24:06.160
I would've said
he was flighty and uncommitted.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.720
So would I.
He has really come along.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.760
I guess that puts Wayne Fiscus
near the top of the list.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.680
Bombs away.

24:13.680 --> 24:14.880
Eyeliner, Nicki.

24:14.880 --> 24:18.080
You know, people are always
asking for free advice.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.120
Yes.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.160
Serious now, you're a doctor.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.360
I can't wait to see this in print.

24:23.360 --> 24:26.680
His performance in ER
has been first rate.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.120
He is always ready to leap in.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.640
There is an acute sense
of the procedure required.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.960
And a good rapport with his patients.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.680
I had a couple to tide me over.

24:35.680 --> 24:36.800
Are you out of your mind?

24:36.800 --> 24:39.000
Hit him with the spritz.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.960
Pull the ripcord!

24:40.960 --> 24:42.720
I think he needed to grow up
a little.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.400
Yes!

24:44.400 --> 24:47.960
Nothing like a year downstairs
to speed that along.

24:47.960 --> 24:51.240
It's always nice when a resident
really matures on the job.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.640
I'm having second thoughts
about this.

24:53.640 --> 24:57.640
Outstanding.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.200
One more.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.880
Wendy Armstrong.

25:03.880 --> 25:07.200
Well, Pinning in Orthopaedics
raves about her.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.880
She is a fine clinician,

25:08.880 --> 25:12.680
I just wish you could respond
a little more warmly to people.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.600
She certainly fell to pieces in
the mortality conference last week.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.480
I can't call that a good sign.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.120
It could have happened to anyone.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.920
Especially when you consider what
she has been through recently.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.760
Yeah. When I think
of that Gaucher patient,

25:24.760 --> 25:27.400
she really did a wonderful
job on that man.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.920
I tell you, I like her.
She's sharp, she thinks for herself,

25:29.920 --> 25:31.640
she usually knows
her stuff inside out.

25:31.640 --> 25:33.560
So, were OK on Wendy?

25:33.560 --> 25:35.000
I am, for sure. Mark?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.040
Oh, yeah.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.400
Well, that is it, gentlemen,
we have done it.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.960
Hallelujah!

25:39.960 --> 25:42.040
I think we have made
the right choices.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.680
Who knows, time will tell.

25:44.680 --> 25:46.960
Might as well release the news.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.960
'3434, Dr John Lovins. 3434.'

26:02.400 --> 26:04.640
&lt; Wendy, wait a sec.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.840
Dr Westphall.
I was just heading home.

26:06.840 --> 26:09.680
Well, you will get the news
officially. Congratulations.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.720
I know I am bending
the rules a little bit,

26:11.720 --> 26:13.520
but I figured you could use
some good news.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.080
It's been a rough week, hasn't it?

26:15.080 --> 26:16.120
It has.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.360
Are you pleased?

26:17.360 --> 26:20.520
I guess so.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.800
Something wrong?

26:21.800 --> 26:24.280
No, no more than usual.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.960
I just wish I were ready
for another year.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.440
I'd like to tell you that things
get easier down the road,

26:29.440 --> 26:31.320
but I would want to make
any promises.

26:31.320 --> 26:34.080
At least a couple of weeks' vacation
will make you feel better.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.120
Sure.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.480
Made any plans?

26:36.480 --> 26:39.640
No, no plans.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.400
Thanks, Dr Westphall.
I'm going to head home.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.960
I'm tired, I'm hungry...

26:43.960 --> 26:45.240
OK, good night.

26:45.240 --> 26:48.720
Good night.

26:48.720 --> 26:52.720
Robert, don't get cute, what time
did the messenger get there?

26:54.760 --> 26:58.080
Is the envelope fat or thin?

26:58.080 --> 27:00.160
Kind of in between?

27:00.160 --> 27:03.640
Would you open it for me, please?

27:03.640 --> 27:05.920
Why don't you walk right
over there and listen in?

27:05.920 --> 27:07.600
I can't go home,
I'm stuck here,

27:07.600 --> 27:09.520
at least I can find out
how everyone else did.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.880
Curious satisfaction.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.960
(YELLS)

27:12.960 --> 27:15.840
Read that first sentence again.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.640
We'll celebrate later!

27:18.640 --> 27:20.240
I love you, too.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.440
Bye.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.400
Big surprise,
as if you had any doubt.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.920
Congratulations, Jackie,
you really deserved it.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.320
I've got to get back to ER.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.960
Meaning I don't?

27:30.960 --> 27:33.360
Victor, don't worry,
they won't cut you.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.200
Thanks, pal,
I really appreciate that.

27:35.200 --> 27:39.200
And if they do, we'll give you
a big goodbye party.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.440
Good night, Helen.

27:47.440 --> 27:50.200
Good night.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.480
ELEVATOR DINGS

27:52.480 --> 27:54.800
Dr Craig, wait, wait!

27:54.800 --> 27:57.400
I can't stand it any longer,
I've got to ask you a rare favour.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.760
Yes, Ehrlich.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.440
I know about all the rules
and confidentiality,

28:01.440 --> 28:03.600
but this waiting in limbo
is unbearable.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.120
You know, it's unhuman, it's...

28:05.120 --> 28:07.280
I know, Ehrlich. Yes.

28:07.280 --> 28:10.000
I'm going to be here for the rest
of the night, you know?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.640
I'm not going home
until the morning.

28:11.640 --> 28:14.560
Suppose I get called into the OR?
I won't be able to stitch straight.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.120
I'll drop an ambu bag
or I'll cauterize a nurse.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.960
Ehrlich, did you hear what I said?

28:18.960 --> 28:20.000
What?  Yes!

28:20.000 --> 28:21.920
What do you mean yes? Yes what?

28:21.920 --> 28:24.400
You passed, we want you back.
Lord knows why!

28:24.400 --> 28:27.120
Now, may I please go home?

28:27.120 --> 28:29.520
Sure. Yes!

28:29.520 --> 28:31.440
Oh, yes!

28:31.440 --> 28:33.280
I hate cheap sentiment.

28:33.280 --> 28:37.280
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28:45.800 --> 28:49.200
Join me.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.280
Go on, read it.

28:52.280 --> 28:56.280
I've been cut.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.680
They didn't even bother
to messenger it to my house,

28:59.680 --> 29:03.680
they just plopped
it in here on my desk.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.360
I'm sorry.

29:07.360 --> 29:11.360
Raw deal number nine.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.560
Women that did that to me.

29:13.560 --> 29:17.080
They're chipping away at me,
ruining my chances.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.640
It wasn't a conspiracy, Peter.

29:19.640 --> 29:23.640
There's some thing weird about it,
man.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.160
You can't trust them,
that's for sure.

29:29.160 --> 29:33.160
I mean, one minute
they're flirting with you,

29:34.040 --> 29:36.720
throwing their legs around.

29:36.720 --> 29:40.720
The next minute
they're screaming bloody murder.

29:43.920 --> 29:47.920
You never know
where you stand with them.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.840
Myra was the same way.

29:51.840 --> 29:54.280
She believed every half-baked
accusation about me

29:54.280 --> 29:56.000
and she never
even gave me a chance.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.840
And the worst thing is
she stole the kids.

29:58.840 --> 30:02.840
Left me with nothing.

30:04.400 --> 30:08.400
I hate women.

30:08.520 --> 30:11.960
They get their claws in you
and they just kind of...

30:11.960 --> 30:15.960
You're drunk.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.240
That's what I like about you, Jack,

30:19.240 --> 30:21.680
you are a real quick study,
aren't you?

30:21.680 --> 30:24.840
What are you so glum about, huh?

30:24.840 --> 30:27.640
Huh?

30:27.640 --> 30:30.240
You've got the big future.

30:30.240 --> 30:34.240
Everybody LOVES Dr Morrison.

30:35.680 --> 30:38.480
Now,
if you came in here to celebrate,

30:38.480 --> 30:41.160
you just go on someplace else.

30:41.160 --> 30:45.040
I'm not in the mood.

30:45.040 --> 30:48.320
They cut me, too, Peter.

30:48.320 --> 30:52.320
I'm out.

30:55.040 --> 30:59.040
I keep going over it, over it.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.680
The whole year.

31:02.680 --> 31:06.680
All those patients I treated,
all the cases I blew.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.400
There's no excuse.

31:12.400 --> 31:16.400
I deserved to get cut.

31:21.720 --> 31:25.720
A grown man catches
it in his fly?

31:26.080 --> 31:30.080
Pathetic.

31:32.520 --> 31:33.600
Hello.

31:33.600 --> 31:37.600
Ah, there you are.
I had just given up.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.720
Come on in.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.240
I'm going to be late for a meeting,

31:42.240 --> 31:44.360
but there is something
I've got to tell you first.

31:44.360 --> 31:47.320
How are you feeling?

31:47.320 --> 31:51.080
Oh, I've walked taller.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.480
Well, guess what.

31:52.480 --> 31:56.480
I changed our plane reservations
to next weekend and we've got

31:56.800 --> 32:00.800
a room at the Frantel Windsor with
a great view of the Champs-Elysees.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.920
Hey, I thought you'd be excited.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.920
A couple days ago I was, Joan.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.800
It's just that this little accident
has made me focus on something,

32:09.800 --> 32:10.840
that's all.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.920
Stop focusing,
I already paid for the tickets.

32:12.920 --> 32:16.920
Look...

32:18.920 --> 32:22.920
What we have here,
you and me, in my opinion...

32:24.800 --> 32:28.800
..is a relationship built
largely on externals.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.040
A tremendous physical attraction.

32:32.040 --> 32:36.040
That's important to me, obviously,
look what I do for a living.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.200
But it's not enough.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.280
I need to have...

32:40.280 --> 32:44.280
It's built on externals because
that's the way you want it, Bobby.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.640
Because that's the way you see women.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.240
What?

32:48.240 --> 32:49.440
That's totally unfair.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.480
Think about it.

32:50.480 --> 32:54.480
When is the last time you asked me
about my work?

32:55.360 --> 32:57.720
Or my feelings about myself?

32:57.720 --> 32:59.680
Feelings?

32:59.680 --> 33:01.440
You want feelings?

33:01.440 --> 33:02.800
OK, I'll give you feelings.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.120
I have never once understood
what goes on inside that

33:05.120 --> 33:06.800
beautiful head of yours,
if anything!

33:06.800 --> 33:09.400
And right now,
Joan, I don't think I care.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.880
Why are you saying this?  What?

33:10.880 --> 33:13.280
All I'm trying to do is get
this thing out in the open.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.040
By insulting me and tearing us down?

33:15.040 --> 33:18.720
For once, quit being so defensive
and listen to me.

33:18.720 --> 33:22.720
All right, you got it, I'm listening.

33:25.720 --> 33:29.720
Look, I miss caring, OK?

33:32.400 --> 33:36.400
Some kind of tenderness
every once in a while.

33:38.080 --> 33:42.080
Those little intimate things
that usually bring people together.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.600
Well, if that's what you're missing,

33:44.600 --> 33:48.600
this is a hell of a way
to try and get it.

33:53.840 --> 33:56.520
The envelope was actually
addressed to Wayne Viscus,

33:56.520 --> 33:59.960
Viscus with a V,
like something got coagulated.

33:59.960 --> 34:03.960
The big bash will have
to wait till later.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.120
Consider this on duty champagne.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.160
Hooray.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.199
There you go.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.960
Nice going, you guys,
congratulations.

34:09.960 --> 34:10.719
Thanks.

34:10.719 --> 34:11.760
Thanks.

34:11.760 --> 34:15.280
You deserve it...I guess.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.360
They held me
at The Examiner forever.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.480
I just had time to stop home,
pick up the letter,

34:19.480 --> 34:21.080
change my clothes and get back here.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.360
SIRENS

34:23.360 --> 34:25.360
I'll bet this one is a car accident.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.760
Domestic squabble.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.440
We'll see.

34:29.440 --> 34:32.040
I can't get a BP or a pulse.
Police found this.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.440
It was just filled today.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.480
Call a code!

34:34.480 --> 34:37.800
EKG ready, nasal gastric tube
and CDP tray, stat!

34:37.800 --> 34:39.560
Oh, my God. It's Wendy!

34:39.560 --> 34:43.560
Oh, no! Come on!

34:46.800 --> 34:49.719
Ventricular fibrillation.
I'll charge the defibrillator.

34:49.719 --> 34:53.120
Up her bicarb lidocaine,
100 mg, stat.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.040
Where the hell is our code team?

34:55.040 --> 34:57.880
Full suction.

34:57.880 --> 35:00.320
Come on, Wendy.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.600
&lt; Anything coming out?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.400
No.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.920
No aspiration. She must have taken
these pills hours ago.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.480
Still no pulse.

35:07.480 --> 35:11.480
She's in prefib, we've got
to break it. Come on, move!

35:14.400 --> 35:15.480
Hands off.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.160
Clear!

35:17.160 --> 35:17.840
Come on!

35:17.840 --> 35:19.080
Come on!

35:19.080 --> 35:20.480
Hands off.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.280
Clear! &gt;

35:21.280 --> 35:23.240
Clear! &gt;

35:23.240 --> 35:25.440
No, she's flatlined,
give me some epi, come on!

35:25.440 --> 35:29.440
Not IV, I'm going directly
into the heart.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.160
No.

35:33.160 --> 35:37.160
Let's shock her again.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.360
All right, all hands off.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.840
Clear!

35:41.840 --> 35:45.840
No!

35:47.960 --> 35:51.080
No.

35:51.080 --> 35:55.080
No.

36:27.280 --> 36:30.120
You'll need to sign these
to take the body back

36:30.120 --> 36:34.120
to the medical examiner's office.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.680
There is to be an official autopsy
to rule out foul play.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.960
Foul play?

36:41.960 --> 36:44.400
That would almost make it
easier to accept.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.880
There wasn't.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.320
Or an accident either.

36:47.320 --> 36:51.320
The police found a note she left.

36:52.360 --> 36:56.360
Why don't we step outside?

37:06.160 --> 37:08.680
Cathy, I want to congratulate you,

37:08.680 --> 37:11.200
not only on next year,
but also on your board scores,

37:11.200 --> 37:15.200
there were the highest
of any resident here.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.920
I was never very good
at tests in school.

37:18.920 --> 37:22.920
Obviously, you've gotten better.

37:23.120 --> 37:27.120
I wanted to let you know, I'm
planning to change my residency.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.200
I want to switch to psychiatry.

37:29.200 --> 37:33.200
I suspect you'd make
a very good psychiatrist.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.200
Then, you'll help me?

37:35.200 --> 37:36.840
Of course.

37:36.840 --> 37:40.080
I've learned so much
about my own dark side.

37:40.080 --> 37:44.080
I believe I will be able to show
other people how to exorcise theirs.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.440
I'd better get back to Wendy.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.800
Cathy.

37:50.800 --> 37:54.800
In all candour, I used to think
your mind was somewhere else.

37:55.280 --> 37:59.280
It's nice to know one's opinion
of people can change.

38:00.840 --> 38:04.840
Thank you.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.200
Dr Westphall.

38:11.200 --> 38:15.200
Yes, Jack, come on in.

38:16.040 --> 38:20.040
Listen, if this is about the cut,
I understand, you had no choice.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.600
I'm going to call my folks
in Seattle tonight

38:22.600 --> 38:25.360
and I'm going to start looking
for a place for us.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.920
In a way,
that envelope made things easier.

38:28.920 --> 38:32.920
Jack, we met again this morning,
and we all agreed your work

38:33.200 --> 38:35.520
this past year was affected
pretty much by things

38:35.520 --> 38:37.760
that you had no control over.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.600
Our hope is that
the second year will be better.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.680
You are our first choice
for the vacancy.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.960
Oh, no. No, no, I couldn't.
No, not this way.

38:46.960 --> 38:50.960
Think about it.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
I just wondered
if you had contacted Wendy's family.

39:00.160 --> 39:02.360
They're living in San Diego now.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.760
I was waiting
for a decent hour to call them.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.840
There is no such thing, is there?

39:06.840 --> 39:09.240
Right.

39:09.240 --> 39:13.200
Why did she do it?

39:13.200 --> 39:16.000
She left a note, you know.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
It said, "Why does life
always start tomorrow?"

39:30.320 --> 39:32.080
Anybody get any sleep?

39:32.080 --> 39:33.240
No.

39:33.240 --> 39:37.000
You know, I read somewhere that
the suicide rate among doctors

39:37.000 --> 39:39.440
is three times higher
than the general public.

39:39.440 --> 39:41.480
Save the statistics, Vijay, huh?

39:41.480 --> 39:43.600
Yeah, I can't stand to keep going
over and over it.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.760
OK, pass me the crow, I'll eat it.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.080
What are you talking about?

39:47.080 --> 39:49.480
Wayne's spread in The Examiner.
Here, take a look.

39:49.480 --> 39:50.600
Oh, boy.

39:50.600 --> 39:53.560
Let me see that.

39:53.560 --> 39:54.960
That's not really you, is it?

39:54.960 --> 39:56.400
That bad, huh?

39:56.400 --> 40:00.400
Are you kidding? It's great!

40:01.120 --> 40:03.280
Can you really buy
that black underwear?

40:03.280 --> 40:04.840
Yeah, give me the tux.

40:04.840 --> 40:06.240
Good old Goose.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.840
OK, I'll admit it,
you look fabulous.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.600
Not only that, the women are going
to be battering down your door.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.360
Change your phone number
while you can.

40:12.360 --> 40:16.120
(TANNOY) 'Dr Fiscus, 5347.'

40:16.120 --> 40:17.760
Oh, please let that be an emergency.

40:17.760 --> 40:21.760
Forget it, Ehrlich,
the lemmings have started to call.

40:30.440 --> 40:34.440
Hello? This is Dr Fiscus.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.520
Jean? Jean who?

40:39.520 --> 40:42.680
Oh, Gene.

40:42.680 --> 40:46.680
Look, buddy, I'm glad
you enjoyed the photos, I'm not...

40:48.160 --> 40:52.160
No, I do not make house calls, OK?

40:52.840 --> 40:56.840
You want to WHAT?

40:58.440 --> 41:02.440
Why don't you try the want ads
in the men's room, OK?

41:04.600 --> 41:08.600
Annie, how are you doing?

41:15.840 --> 41:17.840
What do you want?

41:17.840 --> 41:19.560
I've been waiting for you.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.560
The trial is over, Cathy,
there's not much to say.

41:22.560 --> 41:25.080
Yes, there is.

41:25.080 --> 41:29.080
I just came to say that I...

41:29.880 --> 41:31.360
..I forgive you.

41:31.360 --> 41:35.360
I don't have room in my life
for feelings of hate and revenge.

41:36.240 --> 41:40.240
You're sick, Peter.
I hope you get the help you need.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.080
I wonder why the jury
didn't believe you.

41:44.080 --> 41:46.960
We both know what happened.

41:46.960 --> 41:49.840
You will be carrying it
with you for the rest of your life.

41:49.840 --> 41:53.760
How does it feel to be
such an easy target?

41:53.760 --> 41:55.720
Nobody will believe you
the next time.

41:55.720 --> 41:59.720
Some day, someone will get back
at you when you least expect it.

41:59.920 --> 42:03.000
But it won't be me.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
Now get out of my way.

42:18.600 --> 42:22.600
I don't know. Oh, hold on. Wayne!

42:23.920 --> 42:26.440
A guy named Sluggo is asking for
you.

42:26.440 --> 42:27.480
Who?

42:27.480 --> 42:30.400
Says he's a boxer
and he likes your taste in shorts.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.960
No.

42:32.960 --> 42:36.960
No, I haven't seen Dr Fiscus.

42:37.480 --> 42:41.480
Yes, we're all proud of him.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.640
I got the news.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.720
Good, then we don't have
anything to talk about.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.440
Yes, we do.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.040
I know how good my board scores were

42:51.040 --> 42:53.640
and you know the quality of my work
has been improving.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.200
Yet you still torpedoed me.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.560
You got what you deserve.

42:56.560 --> 42:59.280
Even though the jury found me
innocent, you are still doling out

42:59.280 --> 43:01.480
punishment like you are
above the law or something.

43:01.480 --> 43:02.640
What gives you the right?

43:02.640 --> 43:06.640
You are the last person on this earth
I have to explain myself to.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.680
I'm taking you to court, Westphall.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.760
They'll force you to give me
a second year.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.680
I'll be back!

43:12.680 --> 43:16.680
I'll be back.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.240
I got one.

43:23.240 --> 43:25.640
What's the difference
between a resident's first year

43:25.640 --> 43:27.240
and the last days
in Hitler's bunker?

43:27.240 --> 43:28.040
Nothing.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.040
Nothing.

43:30.040 --> 43:32.000
That joke outdates my first year.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.160
Thank you.

43:33.160 --> 43:35.640
Hey, did anyone hear who got cut
besides Peter White?

43:35.640 --> 43:38.080
Karen, Rosen, Cooper.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.360
Cooper, oh no.

43:39.360 --> 43:40.560
The Three Musketeers.

43:40.560 --> 43:41.720
Hi Jack.

43:41.720 --> 43:42.760
Jack, pull up a chair.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.440
I guess you guys are stuck
with me for another year.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.600
Congratulations.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.480
Every time I read this thing,
it gets better and better.

43:49.480 --> 43:50.640
Stop reading it. &gt;

43:50.640 --> 43:54.240
Any of you guys decided
on your specialty yet?

43:54.240 --> 43:57.200
Wayne has got a great future
with Giorgio Armani.

43:57.200 --> 44:00.320
OK, OK,
so I fell asleep on the watch.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.400
No, really,
I've been thinking about it...

44:02.400 --> 44:04.160
This isn't the time, OK?
Shut up about it.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.400
Hey.

44:05.400 --> 44:09.000
I'd like to propose a toast.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
Welcome to the second year, it'll be
just as much fun as your first.

44:13.440 --> 44:17.440
Oh, no.

44:17.600 --> 44:21.520
To all of the ambulance drivers
and paramedics and firemen

44:21.520 --> 44:25.520
and all those wonderful people
that help me earn a living in ER.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.840
You've out-brained us, Fiscus.

44:27.840 --> 44:29.280
Hey, to all my friends.

44:29.280 --> 44:30.800
Both of them.

44:30.800 --> 44:31.920
No, really.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.920
I know most of you have found it
necessary to call me a pig

44:34.920 --> 44:35.960
this past year.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.000
(SNORTS)

44:37.000 --> 44:39.960
So I hope each and every
one of you spend 1,000 hours

44:39.960 --> 44:42.880
in the OR with Dr Craig.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.680
To a new beginning
for those who seek one.

44:45.680 --> 44:48.200
That's nice.

44:48.200 --> 44:52.200
To all my friends
who made me look so good.

44:52.720 --> 44:56.720
To the poor, unsuspecting slobs
following in our footsteps.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.960
Your turn, pal.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.880
St Eligius.

45:02.880 --> 45:05.440
Boy, that is all we seem
to talk about.

45:05.440 --> 45:07.480
I talk about Boston General
sometimes.

45:07.480 --> 45:09.520
That's nice.

45:09.520 --> 45:12.080
Look, I'm not saying it's bad,
I'm just saying it's...

45:12.080 --> 45:14.280
it's our common bond.

45:14.280 --> 45:16.360
It sure is.

45:16.360 --> 45:19.320
It is one of our common bonds.

45:19.320 --> 45:23.320
And we spend so much time
at that hospital.

45:23.440 --> 45:27.440
It's like the work
becomes everything.

45:27.840 --> 45:31.840
I guess one of the dangers
is we start to neglect ourselves.

45:35.360 --> 45:39.360
Trying to save other people's lives
and we lose track of our own.

45:44.520 --> 45:48.520
Anyhow, that's what I learned today.

45:50.280 --> 45:54.280
The hard part is going to be

45:54.280 --> 45:58.280
hanging on to who we
are in our hearts.

46:05.040 --> 46:09.040
To the memory of Wendy Armstrong.

46:27.920 --> 46:48.000
