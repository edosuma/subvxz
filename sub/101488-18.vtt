WEBVTT

00:20.437 --> 00:22.897
The green ones taste like
apple-flavored paint,

00:22.981 --> 00:25.066
the purple ones taste like
grape-flavored hair spray.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.235
I love discount candy. Mmm.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.487
Gene, we're supposed
to share the candy, remember?

00:29.571 --> 00:31.114
You're kind of eating it
a little fast there, buddy.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.742
Yeah, but you're not eating it at all,
like a sociopath.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.160
Because I'm saving mine for later.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.745
Wait, where'd my stash go?

00:36.828 --> 00:38.246
-Louise!
-Tina, relax.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.623
I'm just storing it for you in my face.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.791
Ugh! Give me the bag.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.376
-Tina, no!
-No!

00:43.460 --> 00:46.463
Hey, I told you kids you could
have that bag of cheap candy

00:46.546 --> 00:48.340
as long as you shared it
like civilized people.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.468
It's Gene's fault.
He started double-fisting it.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.845
But I only did that
because I saw Tina hoarding it.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.181
It's hard to hoard when Louise
keeps stealing from me.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.849
I mean, Lin, you did give three kids

00:57.932 --> 01:00.018
a giant bag of candy and said, "Go nuts."

01:00.101 --> 01:02.354
Yeah, go nuts, but don't start fighting

01:02.437 --> 01:04.189
like a bunch of Hunger Games. Gimme.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.774
-ALL: No!
-You can have this back

01:05.857 --> 01:08.151
when you stop being Sour Patch poops.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.403
Good job, Tina.
Now we have nothing to live for.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.697
Kids, come on,
I-I know sugar makes you all insane,

01:12.781 --> 01:15.950
but maybe try not to act like jerks
toward each other?

01:16.034 --> 01:18.203
-What, Dad? I wasn't listening.
-Yeah, me, neither.

01:18.286 --> 01:21.498
-I couldn't hear you over the sugar in my body.
-I want candy.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.041
-Okay, forget it.
-(fryer beeping)

01:23.124 --> 01:25.460
Will one of you kids take the basket
out of the deep fryer?

01:25.543 --> 01:28.088
I made some fries 'cause I know
Teddy will be here soon

01:28.171 --> 01:30.590
-and you know how he gets when he has to wait for fries.
-On it.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.347
Gene, you know
you don't have to sing along

01:37.430 --> 01:39.641
with every sound in the world, right?

01:39.724 --> 01:41.017
I wish I didn't, Father.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.852
-Hey, Teddy.
-Hi, everyone.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.813
-Uh, do I smell fries?
-They're coming.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.940
They're coming.
Soon, or, uh...

01:47.023 --> 01:48.775
Okay, I'm gonna
go park the car real quick.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.735
-Can I come with you?
-Yeah! -Me, too.

01:50.819 --> 01:51.861
You kids realize I'm just driving

01:51.945 --> 01:53.238
around the corner, right?

01:53.321 --> 01:54.572
We don't have a lot going on today.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.449
Yeah, that candy was
kind of my whole schedule.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.244
Well, you could help me
fill up these napkin holders.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.247
Mom, are you paying attention?
Dad needs us to help him park.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.374
-Fine, go.
-ALL: Yay!

02:04.457 --> 02:05.959
Hey, Andy.
Hey, Ollie.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.919
We're playing outside today.

02:08.003 --> 02:10.630
That's a cantaloupe.
Fruit can be heads.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.090
And vice versa.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.676
Okay. All right, Dad.
Where are we really going?

02:14.759 --> 02:16.553
-Lake Titicaca!
-Gene.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.638
-Vegas, baby.
-I told you, we're just going

02:18.722 --> 02:20.515
to park the car around the block.
Oh!

02:20.598 --> 02:22.726
-(all shout)
-Is-is everyone okay?

02:22.809 --> 02:23.810
-I'm good.
-Me, too.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.061
I'm great.
Again!

02:25.145 --> 02:26.938
Uh, it's just a little fender bender.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.398
We-we just got hit from behind.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.650
Also, you hit someone
in front of you, I think?

02:30.734 --> 02:32.569
LOUISE:
And they hit someone in front of them.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.363
Okay, so, uh, it's, uh,
a few fender benders.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.907
AKA a friender blender.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.784
My babies!
My babies!

02:39.868 --> 02:41.953
Are you hurt? I knew
I should have never let you get in cars.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.913
-E-Everyone's okay.
-JIMMY: Hey, Bob!

02:43.997 --> 02:46.082
I always knew you were
a train wreck, but this?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.417
(laughs)
Zoom!

02:47.500 --> 02:49.753
Good one, Jimmy.
That was a funny comment to make.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.796
Trev, I told you, don't say,

02:51.880 --> 02:53.465
"That was a funny comment to make."

02:53.548 --> 02:55.050
-But it was.
-So just laugh.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.593
I don't like my laugh.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.428
Oh, my gosh.
What the heck just happened?

02:58.511 --> 03:00.472
Uh, you rear-ended us.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.891
I got to call you back.
I just got into an accident.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.309
No, no, baby's fine.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.227
-Oh, God, there's a baby in there?
-(shushes)

03:06.311 --> 03:08.229
You're okay, baby.
You're just scared,

03:08.313 --> 03:09.522
-that's all.
-Oh.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.525
Well, that was a real bumper bummer.
(chuckles)

03:12.609 --> 03:14.611
If you're wondering about my face,
I'm a clown.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.571
That was gonna be my third guess.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.616
So, we should probably
all exchange info, right?

03:19.699 --> 03:22.202
(belches) Sorry.
When I get stressed,

03:22.285 --> 03:25.038
I burp. I just... (belches)
I feel terrible.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.791
Look, I-I'm sorry this happened,
but you know, um,

03:27.874 --> 03:29.459
-people make mistakes.
-(belches)

03:29.542 --> 03:30.960
I mean, if you need to sit down,
get a glass of water,

03:31.044 --> 03:33.046
this is actually
our restaurant right here.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.256
I... uh, I'm Bob, by the way.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.466
Bob Burger.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.426
And I'm his wife, Linda.
Hi.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.470
Also we live here. Not in the restaurant.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.222
Upstairs. In our mansion.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.391
-I'm Elaine. -Graham.
-I'm Patti.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.518
Seriously, though,
you're all welcome to...

03:46.601 --> 03:48.019
And I'm Teddy.
Bob's best friend.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.854
This is going great.
(laughs)

03:49.938 --> 03:51.481
Bob, can I speak to you real quick?

03:51.564 --> 03:54.484
If I were you, I wouldn't be too chummy
with these other drivers.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.903
I'm not being chummy.
I'm just being friendly.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.780
Look, I think you should
just call the police

03:58.863 --> 04:00.573
and make sure you cover your butt.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.450
I mean, I really don't think
we need to call the police, Teddy.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.160
This seems pretty cut-and-dry.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.162
Bob, if there's one thing
I know about accidents,

04:06.246 --> 04:08.289
it's that they are never cut-and-dry.

04:08.373 --> 04:11.668
-Trust me. I've been in 17 collisions.
-You have?

04:11.751 --> 04:15.171
Yes. Hit by 21 cars in five states,
not including Guam.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.841
-That's a lot.
-And what I've learned is these accidents--

04:17.924 --> 04:19.592
they bring out
the absolute worst in people.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.053
-Wait. When were you in Guam?
-When I was in the Navy.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.680
Plus, I got a friend there named Tom.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.141
-I never told you about Guam Tom?
-Mm, no.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.269
So, Patti, I-I don't want to be that guy,

04:29.352 --> 04:31.146
but since you were the driver in the back,

04:31.229 --> 04:33.523
h-how did you want to handle this,
i-insurance-wise?

04:33.606 --> 04:36.609
Wait, you think this is my fault?

04:36.693 --> 04:39.529
Um, I mean, uh,
who else's fault would it be?

04:39.612 --> 04:41.740
-I don't know. Maybe him?
-Right. That's Teddy.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.242
-He wasn't even in a car.
-But I get that a lot.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.786
Well, whoever was driving, besides me,

04:46.870 --> 04:48.246
'cause it wasn't my fault.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.582
-It wasn't my fault.
-It sure wasn't mine.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.083
I don't think it was mine, either.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.877
Oh, my God.
Was it my fault?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.879
Tina, sweetie, no.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.048
I mean, why were people
stopped in the middle of the road?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.591
Roads are for driving.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.634
And life is a highway.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.471
Maybe Elaine here was clowning around

05:04.554 --> 05:06.348
and slammed on her brakes for no reason.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.099
Actually, the reason I stopped

05:08.183 --> 05:10.435
was because a ball bounced into the road.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.396
Maybe Graham didn't notice
because he was on his phone?

05:13.480 --> 05:16.316
What? Uh, no.
What about this guy Bob?

05:16.399 --> 05:17.942
He could be at fault.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.362
Maybe he was jamming out
to his music or something?

05:20.445 --> 05:22.155
What?
I-I wasn't jamming out.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.948
Then why'd you apologize earlier?

05:24.032 --> 05:25.533
-I didn't.
-Uh, yeah, you did.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.077
-When?
-The part where you said,

05:27.160 --> 05:28.953
-"I'm sorry this happened."
-You did say that.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.497
I heard it, too.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.040
-I think you did, Bob.
-Um...

05:32.123 --> 05:34.793
To be fair, our dad
has resting apology face.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.087
And his body is all like, "my bad."

05:37.170 --> 05:39.547
Okay, fine.
Maybe I did say sorry.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.717
But, um, uh, Patti said
she felt terrible, remember?

05:42.801 --> 05:46.221
I do feel terrible. My wiener dog broke.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.224
He lives on my dashboard
and he keeps me company in traffic.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.393
-Mm-hm.
-I'm telling you, Bob, just call the cops.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.602
You know what, everyone?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.145
Maybe we should just call the police

05:54.229 --> 05:55.355
and let them figure this out.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.564
-Fine by me.
-Me, too.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.316
Just as long as we're done by 4:00.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.694
I'm clowning at a bris pre-party.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.488
(sighs)
I guess this is not gonna be so simple.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.574
That's what I say every time
I approach a toilet seat.

06:06.658 --> 06:09.786
Remember, in life there are no accidents!

06:13.373 --> 06:16.126
'Okay, so the police are on their way.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.127
I still can't believe that Patti person

06:17.210 --> 06:18.294
won't admit it was her fault.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.046
It's so obvious.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.132
Yeah, she sure went
from sorry to sassy in no time.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.758
I told you, accidents have a way

06:23.842 --> 06:25.260
of bringing out the worst in people.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.220
Their fenders
aren't the only things that bender.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.597
-You mean their ding-dongs?
-No, I mean they'll do anything

06:29.681 --> 06:31.099
to get out of trouble.
You'll see.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.560
Stories change, alliances form.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.020
This shouldn't be complicated, right?

06:35.103 --> 06:37.230
The driver in the back is always at fault.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.606
Well, almost always.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.733
There are two exceptions
where the driver in front

06:39.816 --> 06:41.151
is responsible.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.361
One, if they slam
on their brakes for no reason.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.571
I was barely even moving.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.989
-That's your thing.
-And two,

06:46.072 --> 06:47.407
if they swerve into traffic recklessly.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.575
I didn't do that, either.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.410
All I did was pull away from the curb.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.412
Well, it sounds like
you're in the clear then, Bob.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.414
As long as you signaled
when you pulled away from the curb.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.623
You did, right?

06:55.707 --> 06:57.459
Yeah.
I mean, I always signal

06:57.542 --> 07:00.879
when I leave a curb,
because I'm a safe driver.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.381
Mm. I'm hearing some doubt, Bob.
Do you have some doubt?

07:03.465 --> 07:05.675
No.
I believe I signaled.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.010
Oh, yeah, I'm hearing it, too.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.428
Could be doubt, could be gas.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.513
-Someone push on his stomach.
-Gene, stop.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.766
Bob, you believe you signaled or you did?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.684
Those are two different things,
legally speaking.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.811
Look, Teddy, the fact is it's Patti's job

07:16.895 --> 07:19.189
to not hit the car in front her.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.774
All I'm saying is in my experience,

07:20.857 --> 07:23.068
you only have a few minutes
till the police get here.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.778
So you need to make the words
coming out of your mouth

07:24.861 --> 07:27.280
good ones, not bad ones
like they just were.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.115
I'm just trying to help you
cover your butt.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.492
That's the brand of pants he wears.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.243
-"Help You Cover Your Butt."
-Teddy's right.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.661
People can say whatever they want.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.789
Otherwise it's just he-said-she-shed.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.290
He-shed-she-stead.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.042
-It's one of those.
-What about Jimmy Pesto?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.044
He came out on the street after the crash.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.462
Mostly to make fun of you,

07:42.545 --> 07:44.881
but maybe he could tell you
who caused the accident.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.758
No.
I am not talking to Jimmy.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.218
It might be worth it, Bob.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.928
What if his handsome eyes saw something?

07:50.011 --> 07:51.888
-Handsome eyes?
-You think so, too?

07:51.971 --> 07:55.225
-(groans) Okay, I-I'll be right back.
-I'm coming.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.102
-Why?
-I like going places.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.354
Hi, Andy.
Hi, Ollie.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.357
-Who's your friend?
-We're making a scarecrow.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.442
We'll finally be able to grow corn.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.236
Aw, I love it.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.197
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Driving Mr. Oopsy.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.908
-(laughs) See? I laughed.
-Yeah, that was good.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.785
Uh, look, Jimmy, we were wondering

08:13.868 --> 08:15.704
if you saw what happened
with the accident.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.497
Yeah, I'm always looking
across the street,

08:17.580 --> 08:19.541
because I'm obsessed with you, Bob.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.626
Not!
(laughs)

08:21.710 --> 08:23.503
Actually, you do look
over there a lot, Jimmy.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.046
Trev, just...
(stammers) shush.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.965
No, Bob, I didn't see the accident.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.925
I was too busy serving customers.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.094
Ever heard of them?
(laughs)

08:31.177 --> 08:33.054
Oh, go choke-y on a gnocchi, Jimmy.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.806
Thank you for not helping
in any way at all.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.891
Sure thing, Bob.
All the best.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.560
-Nyah, nyah, la, la...
-Now I'm craving gnocchis.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.395
LOUISE:
Boy, I sure wish I was eating

08:40.478 --> 08:43.148
a giant bag of candy right now,
but I can't,

08:43.231 --> 08:46.151
'cause you two ruined it
with your hoarding and snorting.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.278
Louise, you were stealing.
You're the one who ruined it.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.238
I snorted <i>one.</i>

08:50.321 --> 08:52.907
Bob, hey, just the guy I was looking for.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.200
Hi, Graham.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.202
Uh, do you mind if we step inside?

08:56.286 --> 08:58.580
Uh, sure. Uh, come on in.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.583
Can we get you burger?
A little fender-bender burger?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.168
No, I'm good.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.211
Something to drink?
Little fender-bender drink?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.505
Someone get the nice man
something to drink.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.966
Can I start you off with a glass
of fresh-squeezed water?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.384
Are you an ice man?

09:11.468 --> 09:12.552
Actually Bob, I was hoping to maybe

09:12.635 --> 09:14.971
talk with you in private?

09:15.055 --> 09:17.682
Don't mind me. I'm just Bob's
best friend, as we discussed.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.726
-(chuckles)
-Graham, y-you can just go ahead and say

09:19.809 --> 09:21.436
whatever you need to say.
It's fine.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.063
Okay.
Well, here goes.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.440
I wanted to see if maybe
you would be interested

09:25.523 --> 09:28.068
in making an arrangement?

09:28.151 --> 09:30.570
-(coughs): Told you, Bob.
-What kind of an arrangement?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.073
-Like an alliance?
-It's just your standard arrangement

09:33.156 --> 09:35.533
where we forge an understanding between us

09:35.617 --> 09:38.953
-to nail down a story.
-Nail down a story.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.330
Yeah.
Here's what I'm thinking.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.790
You know how Patti was super into

09:41.873 --> 09:44.668
that weird little plastic wiener dog
on her dashboard?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.003
-Yeah?
-Probably pretty distracting, right?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.130
-Okay.
-Well, maybe we should both bring that up.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.216
I-I feel like we should probably

09:51.299 --> 09:53.218
just tell the police what happened.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.178
And then, that's all.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.472
No, no, I know.
But here's the thing, Bob.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.182
Patti's gonna have a story about us,

09:59.265 --> 10:01.643
so we should have a story about her.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.104
And if you and I both have the same story,

10:04.187 --> 10:05.897
then it really seals the deal.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.357
We're same-story bros, right?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.275
All you have to say is, "Officer,

10:09.359 --> 10:11.486
"the woman who hit me was distracted.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.905
Big time, 100%, no doubt about it."

10:13.988 --> 10:15.573
I-I'm not gonna say that.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.283
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.369
We probably don't even need
to have the same story.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.829
(laughs):
I don't know why I brought that up.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.497
Ooh, water.
Yum, yum, yum.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.124
Hey, I got to go.
Nice chatting with you, Bob.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.291
See you later.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.751
Ugh. Do you believe that guy?

10:26.835 --> 10:28.837
I know. He had a watch and everything.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.088
You maybe should've taken the deal, Bob.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.631
Also, he smelled nice.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.341
-Oh, boy.
-What? W-What's happening?

10:33.425 --> 10:35.719
Oh, looks like Graham over there
is talking to Patti now.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.762
They do seem to be huddling.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.931
-Oh, no.
-Huddling's not good, Bob.

10:40.015 --> 10:43.268
-Maybe they're just cold?
-All right, I-I'm gonna go talk with them, also.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.395
-(speaking indistinctly)
-Hello. Hi.

10:45.478 --> 10:49.733
-Hey, there, Bob.
-I-I was just wondering what you two were talking about.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.318
Oh, we were just talking about the clouds.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.738
-Clouds.
-Yeah, clouds. Don't you love them?

10:54.821 --> 10:56.531
They're so fluffy.
Isn't that right, Patti?

10:56.614 --> 10:57.907
Oh, yeah.
Uh, big time.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.285
100%. No doubt about it.
(belches)

11:00.368 --> 11:02.662
-Wait, why did you just say that?
-What do you mean?

11:02.746 --> 11:05.540
Graham just said those exact words to me.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.417
Uh, I big time did not.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.711
So you two were making an alliance.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.504
You were alliancing.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.797
Bob, the cops are here.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.507
Yep.
Yep, they are.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.134
-Oh, God.
-What's wrong, Dad?

11:16.217 --> 11:18.386
I think I just didn't cover my butt.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.598
-TEDDY: Uh-huh.
-LOUISE: And now it's flappin' all over the place.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.977
Afternoon.
I'm Officer Bridget.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.354
Glad to see everyone's okay.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.521
Here's how this is gonna work.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.148
I'll speak with each driver individually

11:30.231 --> 11:31.399
to get your accounts of what happened,

11:31.483 --> 11:33.068
then I'll write my report,
and based on that

11:33.151 --> 11:35.320
your insurance companies
will determine liability

11:35.403 --> 11:36.738
and all that fun stuff.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.698
Let's make this quick
since I know everyone's busy.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.700
Some of us are even trying
to rent out a guest house.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.744
Newly renovated.
Eh, something to think about.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.079
Okay, who wants to start?

11:44.162 --> 11:45.705
-Me, me. I'll go.
-(Bob groans)

11:45.789 --> 11:47.457
Great. You a homeowner?
Could you see yourself

11:47.540 --> 11:49.000
living real close to a highway?

11:49.084 --> 11:51.628
Uh-oh, Bob, you think they're gonna
throw you under the bus?

11:51.711 --> 11:54.339
-The car accident bus?
-Ugh, maybe.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.757
(quietly):
Psst, Bob, if I were you,

11:55.840 --> 11:57.092
I'd go talk to the clown lady.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.927
She could be your last chance
to form an alliance

11:59.010 --> 12:00.303
of your own and protect yourself.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.430
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.

12:02.514 --> 12:03.973
Whoa, whoa, I'm coming with you.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.059
-Why?
-You crazy? Free clown.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.435
I could use a little clown.

12:07.519 --> 12:08.937
-Hell yeah.
-Okay.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.523
Hi, Elaine, I was wondering
if we could, uh,

12:11.606 --> 12:13.149
maybe chat for a second.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.567
-Also, my kids are right here.
-Ooh!

12:16.945 --> 12:18.571
Who wants one of these?

12:18.655 --> 12:20.448
Yay!
Is it a hat?

12:20.532 --> 12:22.325
It's a hat and it's a swan.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.702
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.954
-Ow! I'm okay.
-So, uh, yeah.

12:26.037 --> 12:29.666
I just wanted to chat about
how you and I, uh, could maybe,

12:29.749 --> 12:32.293
um, you know, help each other out

12:32.377 --> 12:35.046
-with all this car stuff.
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.798
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.968
Oh... oh... oh...

12:40.051 --> 12:41.469
-Aha!
-Huh. That's, uh...

12:41.553 --> 12:44.347
That-That's so good.
That's funny. Anyway,

12:44.431 --> 12:47.475
I was wondering if you wanted
to, um-- oh, God--

12:47.559 --> 12:48.476
f-form an alliance.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.145
Hmm, let me think about that.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.396
-(bicycle horn honks)
-Oop!

12:51.479 --> 12:54.107
-Oh, there's my horn!
-Keep it coming.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.276
Elaine, I get the feeling
you're not taking

12:56.359 --> 12:58.445
this accident very seriously.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.072
Oh, sorry.
It's-it's hard to turn it off.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.533
I just get such a kick
out of seeing people light up

13:03.616 --> 13:05.076
when I do stuff like this.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.996
Woop! Meerp.
Woop! Meerp.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.081
-So much range.
-One more.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.207
-Whoop!
-Thank you.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.500
Life can be tough.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.836
People can use a few extra smiles, huh?

13:14.919 --> 13:15.837
I'll take that.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.255
"Clown Eyed Girl.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.841
Mobile door-to-door clowning service."

13:19.924 --> 13:21.426
This clown gets around.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.219
Anyway, what were you
asking me about, Bob?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.346
Something about an alliance?

13:24.429 --> 13:25.472
You know what, don't-don't...

13:25.555 --> 13:27.307
don't worry about it.
Just forget it.

13:27.390 --> 13:31.227
Well, there is one thing
I would love to discuss with <i>you.</i>

13:31.311 --> 13:33.229
-What happened to your nose?!
-Aah!

13:33.313 --> 13:35.732
Phew. (chuckles)
Good one.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.817
So, how'd it go with Elaine?

13:37.901 --> 13:40.111
-It was... I mean...
-She's our new godmother.

13:40.195 --> 13:43.281
-Sir? You're up.
-Okay. I-I'm coming.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.949
This is it, Bob.
You're gonna do great.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.534
You can cry on cue, right?

13:46.618 --> 13:49.329
So, yeah, I had just started the car,

13:49.412 --> 13:50.997
and I was turning into traffic...

13:51.081 --> 13:52.999
You and your family
were eating at this diner?

13:53.083 --> 13:54.834
Um, it's not a diner.

13:54.918 --> 13:58.004
I mean, nothing against diners,
but this is a burger place.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.423
-Uh, also, we own it.
-Got it.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.925
-Owns... diner.
-Mm-hmm.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.426
Continue with your story, please.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.179
So, uh, yeah, like I said, I was, um, uh,

14:06.262 --> 14:07.806
turning into traffic when...

14:07.889 --> 14:10.266
And did you use your turn signal
when you entered the lane?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.393
I-I believe so.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.395
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't say that.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.689
I mean, I, um, uh, not believe...
I...

14:15.772 --> 14:18.692
(chuckles)
Yeah, I-I definitely did. Yes.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.402
-Attaboy.
-(quietly): Okay, Teddy, okay.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.278
Is that man punching the air?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.864
Yes.
He's, uh, he-he's one of our customers.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.867
-Do you know if he rents or owns?
-Uh, I think he owns.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.537
-Mm.
-Um, so it's the car in the back's fault, right?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.539
I got what I need.
Good luck with your diner.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.000
It's not a...
Uh, uh, thank you.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.918
(groans)
Now she's talking to Patti.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.086
Wh-What is she saying?

14:38.169 --> 14:39.921
Why can't people own up to their mistakes?

14:40.005 --> 14:41.548
I-It doesn't seem that hard.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.133
Ah, I'd love to live in that world, too.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.010
-(fryer beeping)
-Poor, sweet, dumb Bob.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.929
-Ooh, is that more fries?
-Hold your horses. Coming right up.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.061
(gasps) Wait, Dad.
I just realized something

14:55.145 --> 14:56.688
about the accident.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.898
-Really?
-I don't think you used your turn signal.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.984
-What? How do you know that?
-Yeah.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.195
-You know how Gene has a song for every sound in our lives?
-Yeah.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.364
Well, he has a song
for your turn signal, too.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.366
Yep.
It goes: ♪ <i>Fart left, it's a stinker</i> ♪

15:10.326 --> 15:12.412
Okay, okay, yes, Gene,
we all know the song.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.664
Well, I don't remember him
singing it in the car today.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.208
-I don't remember that, either.
-Neither do I.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.626
Oh, Bob.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.046
Okay, fine, maybe I didn't signal.

15:21.129 --> 15:24.341
But tha-that doesn't mean
I entered the lane dangerously.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.176
Bup-bup-bup.
Father, you just said

15:26.259 --> 15:28.011
people should own up to their mistakes.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.888
And then you said
it doesn't seem that hard.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.973
And also you've been saying it all day,
and it's, like,

15:32.057 --> 15:33.892
cool catchphrase, give it a rest!

15:33.975 --> 15:37.771
(sighs) All right,
I'll go talk to Officer Bridget.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.064
Officer Bridget, hi.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.649
I-I just wanted to change
the words I said,

15:41.733 --> 15:44.611
-uh, in your report.
-I don't really have time right now, Bob.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.696
I have to go deal with a highway robbery.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.531
And by "highway robbery,"
I'm referring to the guy

15:48.615 --> 15:50.617
who's painting my guesthouse--
he's charging me a fortune.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.994
Anyway, it's too late
to change the report. I'm all done.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.913
W-Wait, what do you mean you're all done?

15:54.996 --> 15:56.706
Patti told me what happened.
Graham backed it up.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.833
Car one-- that's Elaine--
slammed on her brakes

15:58.917 --> 16:01.086
for no apparent reason,
which caused the accident.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.838
So your report just says
this is Elaine's fault,

16:03.922 --> 16:05.924
and she's gonna have to pay for this?

16:06.007 --> 16:08.343
Well, her insurance will.
Some people shouldn't drive.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.470
No, no, no, no, she-she can't not drive.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.222
She's a traveling clown.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.557
Can't she just carpool
with 20 or 30 other clowns?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.851
(chuckles)
Sorry. Someone had to say it.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.561
What'd the policewoman say?

16:18.645 --> 16:21.439
She said Patti and Graham
both blamed it on Elaine.

16:21.523 --> 16:24.192
So I guess the report's
gonna say it was her fault.

16:24.275 --> 16:27.195
-Oh, no. Poor Elaine.
-She was the best of all of us.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.280
I guess heaven needed a clown.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.533
She's not dead, kids.
She just got screwed over.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.201
You did what you could, Bob.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.538
-You owned up to your mistakes.
-Actually, I never told the cop

16:36.621 --> 16:38.998
about me not using my turn signal.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.042
-Wait. You didn't?
-I started to, but, uh,

16:41.126 --> 16:43.920
it just didn't quite
get all the way out of my mouth.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.338
Oh, boy.
Sounds like you kinda

16:45.422 --> 16:46.881
threw that clown under the bus, Bob,

16:46.965 --> 16:49.175
and now she's gonna have to <i>take</i> the bus.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.344
Bad news for Elaine.
Good news for that bus driver.

16:51.428 --> 16:54.764
She's gonna find
so many quarters behind his ear!

16:56.850 --> 16:58.560
TINA: I can't believe
you never told the policewoman

16:58.643 --> 17:00.603
you didn't use your turn signal, Dad.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.731
In other words,
we should take responsibility

17:02.814 --> 17:05.025
for acting like jerks
when it comes to cheap bags of candy,

17:05.108 --> 17:07.027
but you can just say whatever you want

17:07.110 --> 17:08.862
in an official police report.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.322
(sighs)
I know, Louise. I screwed up.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.867
I-I need to go make this right.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.326
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.203
Whoa, whoa, hey!
We don't want another accident

17:17.287 --> 17:18.747
in front of your diner, Bob.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.707
Officer Bridget, please.
J-Just hear me out.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.501
I came here before to tell you that

17:23.585 --> 17:25.503
I didn't actually put on my signal.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.547
I-I remembered that after we spoke.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.175
But the point is, at least
some of the blame for this accident

17:30.258 --> 17:31.718
should be on me.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.553
Okay, great.
I'll definitely make a note of that.

17:33.636 --> 17:34.888
Now, please move out of the way.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.557
Look, I-I just think maybe,
in a perfect world,

17:37.640 --> 17:41.061
-this was all of our faults.
-PATTI: Hey, Bob.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.396
-What are you talking about?
-Yeah, what's going on, Bob?

17:43.480 --> 17:45.023
I was just telling Officer Bridget here

17:45.106 --> 17:46.649
that I didn't use my turn signal,

17:46.733 --> 17:48.943
so it's only fair
that I share some of the blame.

17:49.027 --> 17:52.405
Wow, that's kind of inspiring, Bob.

17:52.489 --> 17:55.367
The truth is, I <i>was</i> distracted
by my wiener dog.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.578
So I guess I was
also partially responsible.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.205
Mm, okay.

18:00.288 --> 18:04.167
I was on my phone, too, so, yes,
I was probably very distracted.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.461
BRIDGET:
You okay, Bob?

18:48.545 --> 18:49.546
Lost you there for a second.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.756
Oh. Right.
Everyone's gone.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.217
Um, sorry.
So, I-I don't know why Elaine stopped,

18:54.300 --> 18:56.970
but I-I just don't think
this was all her fault.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.639
Well, she said she saw
a ball bounce into the street,

18:59.723 --> 19:01.891
but no one else saw it, so I just assumed

19:01.975 --> 19:03.351
she was covering her butt.

19:03.435 --> 19:05.687
And then she sat on a horn and it honked.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.356
-Which was pretty funny.
-ANDY: Be scared, crows.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.108
Be very scared!

19:10.191 --> 19:12.402
Wait. Andy, Ollie,

19:12.485 --> 19:13.987
didn't your scarecrow have a head before?

19:14.070 --> 19:16.031
Li-Like a cantaloupe head?

19:16.114 --> 19:17.198
We lost it.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.742
What-what do you mean, you lost it?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.286
It rolled into the street
and we didn't see where it went.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.288
That must have been the ball
that Elaine stopped for.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.831
It was probably a cantaloupe.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.417
It probably bounced into the street
in front of her car!

19:27.500 --> 19:29.961
-Look! Is that it?
-ANDY and OLLIE: No!

19:30.045 --> 19:32.172
We got to be strong.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.090
We have to get ready for the harvest.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.258
You're right.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.093
Okay, so that changes things.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.846
The way I see it now, driver one
stopped for a legitimate reason,

19:39.929 --> 19:43.141
driver two rear-ended her,
driver three- that's you, Bob--

19:43.224 --> 19:44.934
pulled into traffic without signaling,

19:45.018 --> 19:46.811
driver four rear-ended driver three,

19:46.895 --> 19:48.938
when then sent driver three
into driver two's car,

19:49.022 --> 19:51.232
which caused driver two
to hit driver one's car

19:51.316 --> 19:53.151
for a second time.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.612
Uh, yeah, that sounds right.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.946
Look, I'm no insurance adjuster,

19:57.030 --> 19:59.324
but it sounds like
you may be the only person

19:59.407 --> 20:01.368
taking any responsibility
for this accident.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.370
Which, in insurance terms, could mean

20:03.453 --> 20:05.330
that you end up taking all of it.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.290
Oh, God.
(sighs) Fine.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.626
If that's the way it has to be.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.294
I'll put your amended statement
in my report.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.296
And I'm glad we got this nailed down.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.507
Just like, uh, we nailed down
that new indoor-outdoor carpet

20:15.590 --> 20:18.968
at my guesthouse.
It's 100 extra square feet of living area.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.388
I mean, why can't I rent this place?

20:21.471 --> 20:23.431
Well, our insurance is gonna go up.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.225
Well, up's better than down.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.559
Wait, no, that's not right.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.061
But hey, you did the right thing, Bob.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.562
And you know what goes great

20:29.646 --> 20:31.231
with our insurance rates going up?

20:31.314 --> 20:32.899
Some discount candy!

20:32.982 --> 20:35.318
-KIDS: Yay!
-I mean, not really.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.570
Ugh, you know what?
I don't want to be jerky.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.364
Tina, you can have mine.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.366
I kinda sorta stole a lot
from you earlier.

20:41.449 --> 20:42.742
Oh, I know.
But it's okay.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.327
I was hoarding like a hoardin' fool.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.454
You can both have mine.
I was eating too fast.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.415
-I stopped unwrapping them.
-Wait a minute.

20:48.498 --> 20:51.084
This bag is light.
Like, really light.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.502
Mother!

20:52.585 --> 20:54.337
What?
No!

20:54.421 --> 20:56.381
No, I wouldn't do that.
Bob, back me up.

20:56.464 --> 20:57.924
You want an alliance?

20:58.008 --> 21:00.844
-LINDA: Ooh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-GENE: Pump her stomach!
