WEBVTT

00:00.086 --> 00:01.686
Previously on "Blood & Oil"...

00:01.710 --> 00:02.977
How long have you been screwing my father?

00:03.005 --> 00:05.289
- No, I care about you.
- But you love him.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.117
We're being investigated
by the U.S. government.

00:08.141 --> 00:12.203
They think that we got our hands
on a U.S.G.S. report illegally.

00:12.228 --> 00:13.995
This case you're building
against my father,

00:14.020 --> 00:15.148
it's airtight, right?

00:15.173 --> 00:15.905
Absolutely.

00:16.015 --> 00:16.921
I'm in.

00:16.946 --> 00:19.246
We found a financial backer to stake us.

00:19.271 --> 00:21.971
Annie Briggs. Hap's first wife.

00:21.996 --> 00:23.890
So, you're backing Billy?

00:24.304 --> 00:28.228
Not so much backing Billy,
as I am coming after you.

00:28.263 --> 00:29.562
We leave him here. We walk away.

00:29.598 --> 00:30.630
Oh, God.

00:30.665 --> 00:32.732
They found the man that attacked me.

00:32.767 --> 00:33.900
Did you do something to him?

00:33.935 --> 00:35.668
I had nothing to do with that.

00:35.704 --> 00:37.003
They don't expect Gary to live.

00:37.038 --> 00:38.805
- What?
- Or to ever wake up.

00:38.840 --> 00:39.906
We don't have to worry about it.

00:44.985 --> 00:47.052
Need a little help in here.

00:47.077 --> 00:49.611
I need somebody to hold his
arms. Got to get this tube in.

00:49.636 --> 00:51.036
No, no.

00:51.319 --> 00:52.619
I got to get this tube back in.

00:52.654 --> 00:54.734
Billy!

00:54.759 --> 00:56.526
- He's getting hypoxic.
- Billy!

00:56.699 --> 00:58.599
What did he say?

00:59.828 --> 01:02.328
SVT! I need 6 of adenosine, stat!

01:02.364 --> 01:03.930
6 of adenosine.

01:04.593 --> 01:06.794
Billy LeFever!

01:09.632 --> 01:11.237
Yes, I know.

01:11.273 --> 01:14.007
I said I'd never set foot
back in Rock Springs,

01:14.042 --> 01:17.360
but I think this is really
gonna be a good time.

01:18.476 --> 01:20.179
You know what? I got to call you back.

01:22.257 --> 01:23.950
Turn the car around, now.

01:23.985 --> 01:24.951
Yes, ma'am.

01:27.345 --> 01:28.476
You can't go in there!

01:28.501 --> 01:30.067
I can and I will.

01:30.419 --> 01:31.751
What is she doing here?

01:32.531 --> 01:33.964
Mr. Briggs, I'm very sorry.

01:34.017 --> 01:35.683
Manhandle me and I won't hire you

01:35.718 --> 01:37.118
after he fires you for letting me in.

01:37.153 --> 01:38.386
I'm not gonna fire you.

01:38.421 --> 01:40.421
He might not, but banker
Barbie certainly will.

01:40.937 --> 01:42.000
She's right.

01:42.025 --> 01:44.258
You're supposed to keep this
house safe from lunatics.

01:44.283 --> 01:46.483
Uh, I got it, Pete. Thanks.

01:46.754 --> 01:47.720
Thank you, sir.

01:47.745 --> 01:48.945
Hello, Annie.

01:48.970 --> 01:51.137
What do you want?

01:51.302 --> 01:53.869
I just got an e-mail
from my head geologist

01:53.905 --> 01:56.500
about the land I bought
with Clifton and Billy.

01:56.525 --> 01:59.250
He tells me I just spent
a lot of money on dry land.

01:59.275 --> 02:01.475
Just as dry as your parcel, Harlan.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.067
If I listened to every
scientist that told me no,

02:04.092 --> 02:06.626
I wouldn't have half the fortune I have.

02:07.037 --> 02:09.537
Yet you'd also never
spend your time and money

02:09.562 --> 02:11.445
on anything that
wasn't a sure bet...

02:11.470 --> 02:13.103
Women or oil.

02:13.454 --> 02:15.454
I want to know what you know.

02:18.371 --> 02:21.046
I know the feds think
you've gotten your paws

02:21.071 --> 02:24.005
on a classified U.S.G.S. report,

02:24.030 --> 02:26.697
a report I'm quite certain would explain

02:26.722 --> 02:28.756
why that land is so valuable.

02:28.824 --> 02:31.976
Hap's told the feds, and he will tell you.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.754
He doesn't have the survey, Annie.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.580
It is so nice to hear
you defending your man.

02:37.615 --> 02:40.316
But I think I know how my ex does business.

02:40.351 --> 02:42.051
Give me a copy of the report

02:42.086 --> 02:44.353
and I'll make the problem
with the feds go away.

02:44.388 --> 02:47.156
I can't give you what I don't have.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.567
But why don't you sit
down and have some dinner?

02:50.930 --> 02:53.231
All that hostility must
have made you hungry.

02:53.563 --> 02:55.500
The problem with you, Harlan,

02:55.525 --> 02:58.827
is you've always underestimated your wives.

03:00.425 --> 03:02.559
And I've already eaten.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074

03:17.579 --> 03:20.246
Uh... are you sure about this?

03:20.271 --> 03:23.105
One of my deputies overheard
the federal agent on the phone

03:23.130 --> 03:24.463
and it was crystal clear...

03:24.488 --> 03:28.624
The informant is in Hap
Briggs' executive ranks.

03:28.792 --> 03:29.958
I need a name.

03:29.983 --> 03:31.249
I can't give you a name.

03:31.803 --> 03:33.810
They thought there was a leak.
They moved their operation.

03:33.842 --> 03:35.153
I don't know where they set up shop.

03:35.178 --> 03:37.114
Come on. We're friends. I need a name.

03:37.139 --> 03:39.272
Don't you understand I'm telling
you this 'cause we're friends?

03:40.208 --> 03:41.481
Okay.

03:41.831 --> 03:43.764
I'll find the damn mole myself,

03:43.789 --> 03:47.625
and hopefully I won't
commit a felony when I do.

03:56.260 --> 03:57.903
Sheriff Hamilton.

04:05.075 --> 04:06.046
Hey.

04:06.071 --> 04:06.872
Hey, sheriff.

04:06.897 --> 04:08.537
Um, I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. LeFever.

04:08.562 --> 04:09.795
C-can I come in for a second?

04:09.820 --> 04:11.853
Oh, yeah, for sure. You can come on in.

04:11.957 --> 04:13.223
Uh, is... is
everything all right?

04:13.248 --> 04:15.288
I wanted to talk to you
about something real curious

04:15.791 --> 04:17.599
just happened at the
hospital at the while ago.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.778
Oh, really? What happened?

04:18.803 --> 04:21.504
Gary LaFramboise started talking.

04:21.930 --> 04:23.029
Did he?

04:23.054 --> 04:24.086
Yeah.

04:24.121 --> 04:25.955
Wakes up, pulls out his breathing tube.

04:25.990 --> 04:28.123
He's real desperate to be heard.

04:28.159 --> 04:29.911
But he only gets out two words

04:29.936 --> 04:32.236
before he goes into cardiac arrest.

04:32.261 --> 04:34.962
"Billy LeFever."

04:36.936 --> 04:38.067
Yeah, yeah.

04:38.092 --> 04:41.860
You... have any idea why he
would have said your name?

04:42.086 --> 04:43.152
Yeah, well, if I had any idea

04:43.177 --> 04:45.043
what made that son of a bitch do anything,

04:45.068 --> 04:46.614
I mean, he wouldn't have
attacked my wife, so...

04:46.639 --> 04:47.989
I-I hear you.

04:48.014 --> 04:51.622
I was just thinking that
maybe it could be a clue

04:51.647 --> 04:53.708
as to what happened to him in the woods.

04:54.218 --> 04:56.218
No, I-I can't help you there, sheriff.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.419
I'm sorry.

04:57.455 --> 04:59.575
So, look, if he wakes
up, starts talking again,

04:59.600 --> 05:01.800
I'll be sure to ask him
directly what he meant.

05:01.825 --> 05:02.825
Okay.

05:03.974 --> 05:06.608
All right. Thanks.

05:06.633 --> 05:08.300
You think he will?

05:08.610 --> 05:10.751
- Will what?
- Wake up.

05:11.109 --> 05:14.710
I don't know. Doctor
says it's touch-and-go.

05:14.735 --> 05:16.501
Hmm.

05:16.736 --> 05:18.001
All right.

05:24.445 --> 05:26.185
Why did Gary say your name?

05:26.922 --> 05:28.388
Tell me the truth.

05:29.144 --> 05:30.669
All of it.

05:35.335 --> 05:40.403

05:42.093 --> 05:43.058
I wasn't lying.

05:43.501 --> 05:44.919
Okay, I don't know why he said my name.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.944
It makes no sense that
he would say my name.

05:46.969 --> 05:48.833
- It's just...
- Something's going on, Billy.

05:48.858 --> 05:52.177
And I feel you lying and
acting like nothing's wrong.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.002
I'm not crazy.

05:54.206 --> 05:55.278
Okay.

05:55.748 --> 05:58.231
I haven't been telling you
the whole truth, all right?

05:58.271 --> 06:00.605
I-I didn't take the job with Hap.

06:00.820 --> 06:04.221
I was on my way to doing that,
a-and Clifton stopped me, all right?

06:04.257 --> 06:06.424
There was this new
play with Hap's ex-wife.

06:06.459 --> 06:08.359
- He flew me down to Houston to seal
the deal, that's all. - To Houston?

06:08.394 --> 06:10.561
- Yes. -What? With
Hap's ex-wife?

06:10.597 --> 06:12.597
Wait, y-you didn't think
that that would interest me?

06:12.632 --> 06:14.021
I didn't want to tell you

06:14.046 --> 06:16.447
until the deal was done, honey, okay?

06:16.669 --> 06:18.536
I didn't want you to get
your hopes up, you know?

06:18.578 --> 06:20.044
I mean, listen, baby, with everything

06:20.073 --> 06:21.513
that you've been through, all right,

06:21.541 --> 06:22.873
I just... I
didn't want to...

06:24.043 --> 06:26.644
I didn't want to fail
you again, that's all.

06:26.679 --> 06:28.379
So you lie to me instead?

06:28.414 --> 06:30.081
Yes, I know, I did.

06:30.692 --> 06:31.981
It was... it
was stupid.

06:33.252 --> 06:35.833
Look, I messed up.

06:37.310 --> 06:38.623
All right, and we've been through hell

06:38.658 --> 06:40.992
with this whole ordeal
between Hap and the baby.

06:41.027 --> 06:43.327
I mean, I've made some
some bad choices.

06:43.363 --> 06:44.462
I have.

06:44.497 --> 06:47.698
But, uh... you know, with this deal,

06:47.734 --> 06:49.767
I mean, we're finally gonna
be able to breathe again.

06:49.802 --> 06:51.216
I promise.

06:58.723 --> 07:00.990
So, I want the Briggs corporate logo

07:01.015 --> 07:04.058
projected up in that
space right up in there.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.349
This is a big anniversary,

07:05.385 --> 07:07.151
so I think the decorations
should be over-the-top.

07:07.186 --> 07:08.085
You got it?

07:08.121 --> 07:09.161
Yes, Mr. Briggs.

07:09.186 --> 07:10.652
Thank you.

07:11.349 --> 07:13.481
Given current circumstances,

07:13.506 --> 07:16.560
I should cancel the Briggs
Oil anniversary party.

07:16.596 --> 07:18.329
Nonsense.

07:18.364 --> 07:20.064
Sends the wrong message.

07:20.255 --> 07:22.505
A party says it's business as usual.

07:22.530 --> 07:25.102
Or that Nero is fiddling
while Rome is burning.

07:25.138 --> 07:27.224
Until we find the feds' informant,

07:27.249 --> 07:29.185
Hap, everything else should be secondary.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.850
Okay.

07:33.613 --> 07:35.813
Call Briggs corporate headquarters.

07:36.060 --> 07:38.616
Get all the senior staffers
out here within the hour...

07:38.651 --> 07:40.017
A.J. and Lacey, too.

07:40.053 --> 07:41.085
I'll call Wick.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.586
Should I give them a reason?

07:42.622 --> 07:43.622
Yes.

07:44.239 --> 07:46.590
Tell them we're gonna give
them a confidential briefing

07:46.626 --> 07:48.726
on the stolen U.S.G.S. Report.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.505
Hap, why would you do that?

07:50.605 --> 07:51.971
Because you're right.

07:51.996 --> 07:55.333
Nothing should stand in
the way of a good party.

07:56.927 --> 07:58.536
Are you listening to me?

07:58.571 --> 08:00.838
Yeah. Every word.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.940
This is a wireless transmitter.

08:02.975 --> 08:05.630
It has a recording radius of several yards.

08:05.989 --> 08:07.478
Get your father talking

08:07.513 --> 08:09.814
about how he illegally
obtained the U.S.G.S. report,

08:09.849 --> 08:12.755
and we'll have enough evidence
to put him away for 25 years.

08:12.794 --> 08:14.819
Oh, piece of cake.

08:15.810 --> 08:16.654
My father's not just gonna come out

08:16.689 --> 08:18.355
and start admitting to anything.

08:18.391 --> 08:19.761
He's too smart for that.

08:23.096 --> 08:24.628
Oh, speak of the devil.

08:28.568 --> 08:30.021
Hello?

08:30.361 --> 08:32.428
Hey, I was just heading out to the rig.

08:33.964 --> 08:35.231
Right now?

08:39.160 --> 08:40.974
Okay, yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can.

08:43.416 --> 08:45.649
My father's asking the top
brass over at Briggs Oil

08:45.685 --> 08:46.951
to head to the house asap.

08:46.986 --> 08:48.519
He wants to talk about the report.

08:48.747 --> 08:50.146
Don't screw it up.

08:50.570 --> 08:54.739
You are Briggs Oil, each
and every one of you.

08:54.861 --> 08:58.435
So when the times get toughest,
you need to know the truth.

08:59.146 --> 09:01.198
And you need to hear it from me.

09:01.234 --> 09:02.967
There's no shortage of rumors

09:03.072 --> 09:05.700
about what the government
has said I've done.

09:05.838 --> 09:10.372
I'm here to tell you that
those rumors are not true.

09:10.489 --> 09:12.076
You've all heard the phrase

09:12.111 --> 09:15.913
that a chain is only as
strong as its weakest link.

09:16.302 --> 09:20.700
Well, we have a weak link in our company.

09:21.599 --> 09:23.442
A traitor, in fact.

09:23.714 --> 09:27.349
So today, we're gonna find
out which one of you it is.

09:27.595 --> 09:30.196
That means nobody leaves here until we do.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.934
Thank you all very much.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.942
As soon as you're
checked, you're free to go.

09:52.123 --> 09:53.739
Tell me you don't hate this.

09:53.764 --> 09:56.208
It'll be over in a minute. It's okay.

10:07.866 --> 10:09.294
Has he busted the transmitter?

10:09.994 --> 10:11.160
Don't know.

10:11.930 --> 10:14.192
But if the bug's still
on him, they'll find it.

10:14.521 --> 10:16.121
Is this really necessary?

10:16.146 --> 10:18.647
Her, dad? She's your
daughter, not some stranger.

10:18.672 --> 10:19.938
Wick, relax. It's fine.

10:19.963 --> 10:21.429
No, it's not. It's garbage.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.420
This is your family.

10:22.918 --> 10:25.067
Nobody's special here. Everybody.

10:25.293 --> 10:26.559
Okay, well, I'm not doing it.

10:26.594 --> 10:27.771
It's wrong.

10:28.049 --> 10:29.582
You either trust people or you don't.

10:29.665 --> 10:30.698
Pete, stop him.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.208
All right, if you want to
make a big show out of this,

10:35.233 --> 10:37.433
dad, why don't you come check me yourself?

10:37.458 --> 10:38.661
Happy to.

10:50.798 --> 10:51.897
Are you satisfied?

10:52.041 --> 10:53.507
You can go.

10:59.065 --> 11:00.310
Next.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.771
Your father driving you to drink already?

11:13.775 --> 11:14.825
Mom.

11:14.850 --> 11:15.882
Surprise.

11:15.907 --> 11:17.340
What are you doing here?

11:18.289 --> 11:20.523
Annie's here to make everything better.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.772
Make everything better for who?

11:22.797 --> 11:23.896
For you.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.251
I'm not going back to
Houston. I'm doing fine here.

11:30.088 --> 11:31.988
I love you.

11:32.023 --> 11:33.497
You're a dreamer.

11:34.125 --> 11:37.026
When you were a boy, you
dreamt of being a cowboy.

11:37.372 --> 11:39.929
And now that you're a
man, you dream your father

11:39.964 --> 11:42.098
will be capable of seeing who you are.

11:42.211 --> 11:43.817
This speech again.

11:44.599 --> 11:46.168
The same one you gave me five years ago

11:46.204 --> 11:48.004
when I came here to live with dad.

11:48.317 --> 11:51.207
Look, I know how seductive he can be,

11:51.242 --> 11:53.643
how he can convince you that
it's our job to please him,

11:53.678 --> 11:55.878
but it's a game that can't be won.

11:56.211 --> 11:58.169
You know what is so confusing to me?

12:00.582 --> 12:03.215
I can't tell if you hate dad or love him.

12:03.958 --> 12:06.028
Some days I can't, either.

12:07.492 --> 12:09.425
But you...

12:09.460 --> 12:10.864
I always love.

12:11.996 --> 12:13.247
Every day.

12:13.865 --> 12:15.932
Which is why I want
you to come work for me.

12:16.177 --> 12:18.000
I'm setting up shop here.

12:18.036 --> 12:19.602
Best way to get your father to notice you

12:19.637 --> 12:21.333
is to beat him at his own game.

12:23.975 --> 12:25.207
Mom, I can't.

12:25.243 --> 12:26.175
Why not?

12:27.194 --> 12:28.793
It's complicated, but just...

12:29.466 --> 12:31.047
Trust me. I'm doing fine here, okay?

12:31.082 --> 12:32.271
And you can forget about dad.

12:33.479 --> 12:34.903
He's gonna get his.

12:38.905 --> 12:40.405
Ever the dreamer.

12:44.362 --> 12:45.997
Call me when you wake up.

12:55.910 --> 12:58.575
_

13:07.296 --> 13:08.262
Hey.

13:09.653 --> 13:10.797
So, I have something to tell you

13:10.822 --> 13:12.455
I'm sure you're not gonna want to hear.

13:12.490 --> 13:15.396
And that's stopped you... when?

13:15.660 --> 13:16.919
It's Wick.

13:17.803 --> 13:19.036
He's the mole.

13:21.751 --> 13:23.218
Haven't we been over this?

13:23.354 --> 13:25.392
Yeah, but now I have proof.

13:26.904 --> 13:29.689
Look, I found this in the planter.

13:29.714 --> 13:32.281
A wireless transmitter.
It's deactivated, of course.

13:32.969 --> 13:36.036
He must have thrown it in there
when he made that scene today.

13:39.072 --> 13:40.505
This could have been anybody.

13:40.588 --> 13:42.654
Wick was the only one
close enough to do it.

13:44.601 --> 13:46.868
Look, I'm telling you
this so you can protect him

13:46.893 --> 13:48.660
before he does something he'll regret.

13:50.490 --> 13:52.056
I'm sorry, Lacey.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.224
Look, I-I just thought you should know.

14:08.579 --> 14:09.612
We're screwed, man.

14:09.647 --> 14:11.180
Hey, calm down, all right?

14:11.215 --> 14:12.715
Just have a drink.

14:12.750 --> 14:16.252
Look, you realize if Gary
wakes up and talks, we're done.

14:16.287 --> 14:17.219
That's it.

14:17.255 --> 14:19.488
That is a really big "if," okay?

14:19.524 --> 14:22.625
And what if he does?
It's our word against his.

14:22.660 --> 14:24.760
It's attempted murder,
Wick. That's what it is.

14:24.796 --> 14:26.462
Do you realize that?

14:26.497 --> 14:28.619
I don't know about you, but
I don't want to go to jail.

14:28.644 --> 14:30.299
Relax. Nobody's going to jail.

14:30.334 --> 14:32.701
Yeah, well, I can't take
that chance, all right?

14:32.737 --> 14:35.271
We have to handle this.
We have to handle this now.

14:35.306 --> 14:36.588
What are you gonna do?
You gonna go walk into

14:36.613 --> 14:38.613
that hospital full of people and kill him?

14:39.855 --> 14:41.549
Look, the last thing that you and I

14:41.574 --> 14:43.307
need to do right now is panic.

14:43.575 --> 14:45.842
I can get us out of whatever goes down.

14:45.867 --> 14:47.066
How?

14:48.463 --> 14:49.395
I can't say.

14:49.420 --> 14:50.920
You're just gonna have to trust me.

14:50.955 --> 14:54.017
Yeah, well, trust...

14:54.890 --> 14:56.908
Is a luxury I can't afford right now.

15:02.033 --> 15:04.300
Commissioner Stipple
to see you, Mrs. Briggs.

15:04.924 --> 15:07.558
Nice to see you, Mr. Commissioner.

15:08.891 --> 15:10.964
What do you think of my new Beretta, Myron?

15:10.990 --> 15:13.236
Perfect for hunting small
game, wouldn't you say?

15:14.358 --> 15:15.892
You listen to me, Carla.

15:16.634 --> 15:20.326
I had some visitors yesterday
of the federal variety...

15:20.351 --> 15:21.884
- Mm-hmm...
- Asking me questions

15:21.919 --> 15:24.086
they seem to already have the answers to.

15:24.122 --> 15:26.155
You're always so nervous, Myron.

15:26.190 --> 15:28.124
Let's say the feds think that Briggs

15:28.159 --> 15:30.359
got an early draft of the U.S.G.S. Survey.

15:30.394 --> 15:32.861
- It wouldn't be the end of the world.
- The hell it wouldn't.

15:32.886 --> 15:35.921
Use your imagination. I said Briggs.

15:36.248 --> 15:37.510
There are four of us.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.470
You would pin it on one of the kids?

15:41.506 --> 15:44.838
Sometimes to win, a queen
has to sacrifice a pawn.

15:45.268 --> 15:46.511
Can you do that?

15:46.712 --> 15:49.658
Myron, when it comes to
protecting Briggs Oil,

15:49.683 --> 15:52.417
I can and will do whatever it takes.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.279
Wheelchair to admitting, please.

15:57.304 --> 15:58.937
Wheelchair to admitting.

16:35.381 --> 16:37.648
You're the last man
I'd expect to find here.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.016
Yeah, well, can you blame me...

16:44.588 --> 16:47.336
For wanting to get a glimpse
of the man who took my son?

16:47.371 --> 16:48.571
Hell, I wouldn't blame you

16:48.606 --> 16:50.139
if you were the one who put him here.

16:50.174 --> 16:51.807
What are you getting at?

16:52.788 --> 16:54.432
You know, it's...

16:57.081 --> 16:59.481
It's really rare for a man

16:59.517 --> 17:02.025
to just walk off the edge
of a cliff in the woods,

17:02.367 --> 17:04.096
particularly a local man, like this one.

17:04.121 --> 17:08.056
He's been in those same
woods just dozens of times.

17:08.080 --> 17:11.382
Unless he was running for his life.

17:15.571 --> 17:17.611
Well, that's an
interesting theory, sheriff.

17:18.954 --> 17:19.721
It really is.

17:19.746 --> 17:22.260
There's just, you know,
one problem with it.

17:22.285 --> 17:23.451
Hmm.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.041
You see, if I was the one who put him here,

17:26.671 --> 17:28.517
I'd have finished the job.

17:29.767 --> 17:33.716
And there's no way that you or anyone else

17:33.751 --> 17:35.784
would have been able to find him.

17:50.307 --> 17:51.439
That's her?

17:51.475 --> 17:53.641
Yep. That's one of Hap's.

17:53.791 --> 17:55.674
Been shagging her for
three years, apparently.

17:55.699 --> 17:56.898
Ugh.

17:57.124 --> 18:00.592
Well, have you been able to reach Wick yet?

18:00.617 --> 18:02.549
No. Won't take my calls.

18:02.574 --> 18:05.308
Thought he'd at least pick up the
phone to tell me to stop calling.

18:05.555 --> 18:07.055
I behaved badly,

18:07.090 --> 18:08.523
and I blamed it on Wick,

18:08.558 --> 18:11.627
and I like to try and
justify it, but it's on me.

18:12.721 --> 18:14.963
If this was a lifetime
movie, I'd be the villain.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.665
You can only beat
yourself up so much, Jules.

18:17.701 --> 18:19.033
You got caught between two men.

18:19.069 --> 18:20.650
Yeah, and I trusted the wrong one.

18:25.072 --> 18:26.307
You went dark on us.

18:26.343 --> 18:29.077
Yeah, well, my father has
things locked down tight, okay?

18:29.112 --> 18:30.211
Super-Max tight.

18:30.247 --> 18:31.679
What the hell was I supposed to do?

18:31.715 --> 18:32.564
We have a deal...

18:32.589 --> 18:35.694
Immunity of any past indiscretions

18:35.719 --> 18:37.418
in exchange for...

18:37.454 --> 18:39.154
A digital confession from your father

18:39.189 --> 18:40.682
that links him to the stolen report.

18:40.707 --> 18:43.341
But my father is not some amateur.

18:43.366 --> 18:44.765
Do you really think he's
made a billion dollars

18:44.790 --> 18:46.724
by breaking the law then bragging about it?

18:47.775 --> 18:50.732
He talks about very few
things with very few people.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.408
So if I'm gonna get this done...

18:55.322 --> 18:57.025
I need you guys to sweeten the deal.

18:57.948 --> 19:00.377
I need you to extend
immunity to a friend of mine.

19:01.810 --> 19:03.709
I'm sorry. This isn't
buy one, get one free.

19:03.734 --> 19:05.133
Tell them they're on their own.

19:05.916 --> 19:07.549
And let me be clear...

19:08.486 --> 19:11.072
You better hold up your end, and soon,

19:11.097 --> 19:13.572
or our deal doesn't work for you, either.

19:14.316 --> 19:15.682
I'm so jealous.

19:16.007 --> 19:18.361
Well, perhaps you can visit sometime.

19:18.595 --> 19:20.197
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:20.222 --> 19:23.563
Billy, you didn't tell me
how incredible your wife was.

19:23.588 --> 19:24.666
Yeah.

19:24.701 --> 19:27.235
Well, Annie brought tea and
your partnership contracts.

19:27.270 --> 19:29.070
And then she tried to explain to me

19:29.105 --> 19:30.338
for the last half an hour

19:30.373 --> 19:32.006
why you've been acting like such a weasel.

19:33.243 --> 19:35.307
Hap sucks everyone into the vortex.

19:35.332 --> 19:38.790
I call it the Hap Briggs revenge syndrome.

19:39.478 --> 19:41.383
But I think Billy's cured of it now.

19:41.408 --> 19:43.184
Yeah, well, thanks to
you and the new contracts.

19:43.220 --> 19:45.228
I mean, I can't wait to
start drilling for oil.

19:45.253 --> 19:46.652
About that...

19:46.890 --> 19:49.057
Turns out that land is not as flush

19:49.092 --> 19:50.611
as we thought it was gonna be.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.828
Are you saying that Hap screwed us again?

19:53.863 --> 19:55.897
No, there's something else going on.

19:55.932 --> 19:57.463
I think it's a much bigger play,

19:57.504 --> 19:59.197
which we will find out tonight

19:59.744 --> 20:03.171
and finally see Hap Briggs get his due.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.506
I don't understand.

20:05.542 --> 20:06.574
Put on your finest.

20:06.610 --> 20:08.610
I'm gonna send you a car around 7:00.

20:08.645 --> 20:10.712
We're going to Hap's anniversary party

20:10.747 --> 20:12.146
for Briggs Oil.

20:12.182 --> 20:13.648
Wait, an anniversary party...

20:13.683 --> 20:15.250
The first one was 30 years ago.

20:15.285 --> 20:16.728
It was the best night of my life.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.087
Tonight's promises to be even better.

20:24.027 --> 20:25.963
Look, you have every right to be furious.

20:27.533 --> 20:28.930
I treated you badly.

20:28.965 --> 20:33.275
Worse than that, and... I'm sorry, Wick.

20:34.322 --> 20:36.408
If it makes you feel any
better, Hap played us both.

20:39.075 --> 20:41.042
I can see now what a bastard he is.

20:41.077 --> 20:42.517
- Do you?
- Yeah.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.445
And I guess I finally see

20:44.481 --> 20:45.916
what drove you to hold that gun on him.

20:47.064 --> 20:49.908
Nobody can inspire hatred
quite like Hap Briggs.

20:50.220 --> 20:51.689
You really feel that way?

20:52.499 --> 20:53.564
Yeah.

20:56.359 --> 20:58.900
What if I told you there
was a way to get back at him?

21:00.463 --> 21:03.314
To punish him for lying
to you, deceiving you.

21:05.969 --> 21:06.869
Go on.

21:07.168 --> 21:08.601
The feds are investigating him

21:08.626 --> 21:10.393
for stealing some classified documents.

21:10.418 --> 21:11.418
They came to me first,

21:11.443 --> 21:12.843
but obviously I can't do anything.

21:12.868 --> 21:14.301
You know how paranoid Hap is.

21:14.326 --> 21:16.360
Can't even get close
enough to bug his phone.

21:16.385 --> 21:17.851
So you need someone he trusts.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.609
And who hates him as much as I do.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.283
Just tell me what I need to do.

21:22.319 --> 21:23.424
Call him.

21:23.753 --> 21:25.019
I need to see you.

21:25.307 --> 21:27.252
Yeah, I think I can make that happen.

21:27.467 --> 21:28.633
Invite him over here.

21:28.825 --> 21:30.024
The only way this is gonna work

21:30.060 --> 21:31.459
is if he thinks nothing has changed.

21:31.494 --> 21:32.694
You've got to put him at ease.

21:37.901 --> 21:38.916
And then what?

21:39.569 --> 21:42.770
This phone is an exact replica of Hap's.

21:42.806 --> 21:44.906
The only difference is the
FBI has this one bugged.

21:44.941 --> 21:46.741
- Now, he keeps his phone in
- His jacket pocket, yeah.

21:46.776 --> 21:49.877
You've got to distract him
long enough to make the switch.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.881
And what if he can't be distracted, Wick?

21:54.299 --> 21:56.417
I'm sure you'll think of something.

22:02.592 --> 22:06.236
This is our chance, Jules,
to put an end to his lies.

22:06.499 --> 22:07.721
For good.

22:14.379 --> 22:15.379
Jules?

22:17.273 --> 22:18.861
You want to come join me?

22:19.175 --> 22:20.838
I'll be right there.

22:22.313 --> 22:24.251
Consider it done.

22:30.424 --> 22:31.389
Hello, baby.

22:31.414 --> 22:32.580
How was your meeting?

22:33.394 --> 22:34.760
Productive.

22:35.125 --> 22:36.682
How was it around here?

22:37.581 --> 22:38.572
Mm.

22:39.871 --> 22:41.304
Surprisingly quiet.

22:41.464 --> 22:43.331
Thankfully, your ex-wife
didn't feel the need

22:43.366 --> 22:44.732
to ambush me today.

22:44.768 --> 22:46.968
I wouldn't worry about Hurricane Annie.

22:47.003 --> 22:49.270
She'll peter out before she hits land.

22:50.424 --> 22:52.006
We're in.

22:57.604 --> 22:58.604
Hello?

22:58.639 --> 22:59.838
He woke up a few minutes ago.

22:59.873 --> 23:00.805
He's still groggy,

23:00.841 --> 23:03.346
but he won't be for much longer.

23:04.534 --> 23:05.600
Does anyone else know?

23:05.635 --> 23:07.283
You're the first person I called,

23:07.308 --> 23:08.408
like you asked.

23:08.538 --> 23:10.596
But I'll need to notify the sheriff soon.

23:10.874 --> 23:11.839
Okay, thank you.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.994
Um, I'll be there as soon as possible.

23:16.246 --> 23:17.411
Is everything okay?

23:17.447 --> 23:20.971
Uh, yeah, I just have to go
help Jules with something.

23:21.205 --> 23:23.751
- I'll meet you at the party, okay?
- Sure.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.416
I'm sorry. Um, I should have knocked.

23:36.065 --> 23:37.322
Old habit.

23:37.354 --> 23:40.407
No, that's fine. I'm glad you're here.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.138
Yeah, I just, um, came to get my tux.

23:44.477 --> 23:47.196
Um, I did it, so...

23:47.742 --> 23:48.946
It's done.

23:50.018 --> 23:51.376
Yeah, I know.

23:56.006 --> 23:57.165
Wick, um...

23:58.321 --> 23:59.377
It was, uh...

24:00.490 --> 24:02.642
Fun remembering what we could do together.

24:04.572 --> 24:06.861
I sort of let myself forget about that.

24:06.896 --> 24:08.611
I let myself forget about a lot of things.

24:09.355 --> 24:10.488
Things like, um...

24:11.250 --> 24:12.471
I love you.

24:15.103 --> 24:16.924
I think maybe I always have.

24:17.774 --> 24:19.440
That's funny.

24:21.068 --> 24:22.835
Last week, you loved Hap.

24:23.228 --> 24:24.712
But he... he messed with
my head. That wasn't...

24:24.781 --> 24:27.572
And today, you made it possible
to put him in federal prison.

24:27.597 --> 24:30.298
- Wait... - That's a hell of a way
to love someone, isn't it, Jules?

24:31.986 --> 24:34.017
I think I'll get out while I can.

24:36.557 --> 24:37.925
Wait, this was all you...

24:39.558 --> 24:40.963
You played me.

24:41.277 --> 24:42.609
Played you?

24:46.575 --> 24:48.708
You know what they say
about a Rock Springs whore,

24:48.733 --> 24:50.299
don't you?

24:50.494 --> 24:53.613
If they'll do it for
you, they'll do it to you.

24:54.859 --> 24:56.459
Kind of fits, huh?

24:56.704 --> 24:57.603
Oh, and by the way,

24:57.628 --> 24:59.094
don't go crawling back to my father.

24:59.119 --> 25:01.650
Once he finds out it was
you who switched the phone...

25:03.019 --> 25:04.478
he'll never forgive you, either.

25:06.051 --> 25:07.713
Betrayal's a bitch, isn't it?

25:15.231 --> 25:16.897
Good evening.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.432
Um, yeah. Thank you.

25:32.087 --> 25:35.055
Well, let there be no question

25:35.080 --> 25:37.986
as to one of the many
reasons that I married you.

25:39.099 --> 25:40.665
You look beautiful.

25:40.801 --> 25:42.334
Thank you.

25:42.359 --> 25:44.226
Be careful tonight, okay?

25:44.365 --> 25:46.365
You never know what the
feds have up their sleeve.

25:46.506 --> 25:47.872
Ah...

25:47.897 --> 25:50.398
Don't worry about the feds or anyone else.

25:50.433 --> 25:52.721
I've got eyes and ears everywhere.

25:52.746 --> 25:54.279
If anything goes down,

25:54.304 --> 25:55.304
I'll hear about it.

25:55.471 --> 25:56.671
You look very handsome tonight.

25:56.706 --> 25:57.805
Thank you.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.473
Are you sure I have to go to this party?

25:59.509 --> 26:01.442
If you don't show, Hap
suspects you're the mole.

26:01.477 --> 26:02.710
He suspects you're the mole,

26:02.745 --> 26:04.078
he doesn't talk about
the stolen report...

26:04.388 --> 26:06.017
He talks about his idiot son.

26:06.597 --> 26:08.666
Well, you better get him on tape, quickly,

26:08.775 --> 26:09.717
because Hap's a smart man.

26:09.752 --> 26:11.408
If you don't move now,
he's gonna slip away.

26:11.433 --> 26:13.332
We're confident he'll talk tonight.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.088
Yeah, well, let's hope you're right.

26:16.025 --> 26:17.324
Please. Nice to see you.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.559
Enjoy.

26:18.594 --> 26:20.846
Well, look who's here.

26:21.597 --> 26:24.165
Carla, don't look so surprised.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.333
I must have missed your
names on the guest list.

26:26.369 --> 26:27.244
Huh.

26:27.269 --> 26:30.203
How could I miss a Briggs
oil anniversary party?

26:30.228 --> 26:33.496
I started this company back when
Hap married for love.

26:33.521 --> 26:35.521
And I never forget an anniversary.

26:35.955 --> 26:38.289
I'm happy to see that your advanced age

26:38.314 --> 26:39.680
hasn't caused memory loss.

26:39.716 --> 26:42.057
You know, I got into the oil business

26:42.082 --> 26:44.649
on my own two feet
not on my knees.

26:44.921 --> 26:47.955
Come on, Billy, I'll give you
a tour of the house I built.

26:48.502 --> 26:51.559
You really want to watch
your back with that one, son.

26:52.346 --> 26:54.628
Well, I've been watching my
back for a while now, Hap.

26:56.132 --> 26:57.998
Got to get better security.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.667
Hello. How are ya?

27:04.173 --> 27:05.173
Hey.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.140
Hey.

27:06.175 --> 27:07.908
Dad scored a bottle of Stagg.

27:07.944 --> 27:10.644
So I saved you the last shot.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.313
Hey. Thanks, Lace.

27:12.348 --> 27:13.614
- Yeah, cheers.
- Cheers.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.518
Come here.

27:17.553 --> 27:19.353
So, listen.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.789
The feds are hell-bent on getting dad.

27:21.824 --> 27:24.191
And we both know that they've targeted

27:24.227 --> 27:26.360
an informant that's close to him.

27:26.395 --> 27:27.862
Mm-hmm.

27:27.897 --> 27:30.531
Briggs Oil is dad's life.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.728
And if he were to lose the company

27:34.277 --> 27:37.744
and you had anything to do with it,

27:37.769 --> 27:39.971
you'd lose him for good.

27:41.134 --> 27:43.567
And you'd lose me, too.

27:44.925 --> 27:46.491
Lacey...

27:46.516 --> 27:47.882
I love our family.

27:49.686 --> 27:51.919
We're all in this together, okay?

28:18.056 --> 28:19.562
I prayed you'd wake up.

28:23.402 --> 28:24.905
I was pregnant.

28:25.922 --> 28:27.484
Did you know that?

28:30.560 --> 28:32.015
You took that from me.

28:34.286 --> 28:35.726
From us.

28:42.241 --> 28:43.803
I need to ask you something.

28:45.679 --> 28:47.541
The sheriff told me that when you woke up

28:47.577 --> 28:49.257
you said my husband's name.

28:50.646 --> 28:51.788
Why?

28:55.257 --> 28:57.451
I'm not gonna leave until you tell me.

28:58.374 --> 29:00.945
I was hiding out that night.

29:03.185 --> 29:04.851
And Wick came for me.

29:04.876 --> 29:06.543
He had a gun.

29:10.233 --> 29:11.843
Your husband showed up.

29:12.073 --> 29:13.573
Billy was there?

29:13.671 --> 29:15.656
I knew if they caught me...

29:17.288 --> 29:18.973
They would kill me.

29:19.335 --> 29:20.742
So I ran.

29:22.478 --> 29:24.374
They chased me off a cliff.

29:24.711 --> 29:26.249
I was bleeding.

29:27.890 --> 29:30.457
I begged for help, for mercy.

29:30.482 --> 29:32.915
What did Billy do when you begged?

29:33.305 --> 29:34.851
Nothin'.

29:35.529 --> 29:37.858
He just walked away

29:39.161 --> 29:40.968
and left me for dead.

29:53.609 --> 29:54.808
Hey.

29:54.843 --> 29:56.143
Hey.

29:56.178 --> 29:57.781
So, I talked to Wick.

29:57.806 --> 29:59.906
Look, I don't know what your angle is,

29:59.931 --> 30:02.843
or if you're just trying
to keep the heat off you,

30:03.639 --> 30:05.351
but Wick's not the mole.

30:07.437 --> 30:08.903
Look, I'm sorry, Lacey.

30:08.938 --> 30:11.439
I-I just wanted to help you
protect your brother, that's it.

30:11.474 --> 30:12.440
That's it?

30:12.475 --> 30:13.374
Yeah.

30:13.410 --> 30:15.276
You're not gonna tell me I'm wrong

30:15.311 --> 30:16.678
or try and convince me

30:16.713 --> 30:18.680
that my brother's a criminal mastermind?

30:18.715 --> 30:19.681
No.

30:19.716 --> 30:21.115
You should enjoy the party.

30:30.036 --> 30:31.936
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

30:31.961 --> 30:33.061
Excuse us.

30:33.096 --> 30:34.362
Sure. Yeah.

30:34.397 --> 30:36.731
Just, uh...

30:36.766 --> 30:38.132
It's about Gary.

30:38.168 --> 30:42.136
Look, if he doesn't wake
up, we're home free. Right?

30:42.172 --> 30:45.506
But if, whatever reason, he does,

30:45.542 --> 30:49.210
you said you had a way out of this, right?

30:49.245 --> 30:51.531
Yeah, uh, about that. Um...

30:52.482 --> 30:54.348
I wasn't able to pull it off.

30:54.384 --> 30:55.550
Sorry.

30:56.820 --> 30:58.968
Yeah, well, you don't
seem too worried about it.

30:59.755 --> 31:02.323
Well, maybe I'm becoming an optimist.

31:08.031 --> 31:09.031
Ms. Briggs?

31:09.065 --> 31:10.264
Yes.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.166
M-may I have a word with you?

31:12.202 --> 31:13.434
In private?

31:13.470 --> 31:15.593
Anything for you, handsome.

31:19.657 --> 31:21.546
No, no, no. It's all good.

31:22.245 --> 31:22.944
Dad.

31:22.979 --> 31:24.117
Okay, buddy. Thanks. Bye.

31:24.142 --> 31:25.007
Yes?

31:25.315 --> 31:27.148
I need you to stop doing business

31:27.183 --> 31:29.083
and come and dance with me.

31:29.119 --> 31:31.786
Little girl, doing business is what makes

31:31.821 --> 31:34.188
big old parties like this possible.

31:34.224 --> 31:36.824
Okay, but right now, I'm gonna need you

31:36.860 --> 31:39.527
to take your jacket off and come and show

31:39.562 --> 31:41.996
your boring friends how to have fun.

31:42.065 --> 31:43.631
Yes, dear. We can do that.

31:43.666 --> 31:45.399
Hey, Pete, would you put that

31:45.435 --> 31:47.413
in the master bedroom for me, please?

31:47.438 --> 31:48.804
Thank you, Pete.

31:57.614 --> 32:00.045
Damn it.
We lost him.

32:00.583 --> 32:01.983
What do you mean, we lost him?

32:02.018 --> 32:02.984
He ditched his phone.

32:03.331 --> 32:05.272
I'm getting nothing.

32:59.375 --> 33:01.075
Hey, you made it.

33:01.110 --> 33:02.913
Is... is Jules okay?

33:02.946 --> 33:04.913
I wasn't with Jules.

33:04.938 --> 33:08.140
I was at the hospital with Gary.

33:09.093 --> 33:10.601
Come here.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.456
Why would you do that?

33:15.491 --> 33:17.703
He's awake, and he's talking.

33:17.994 --> 33:20.617
And he said that you're
the one who put him there.

33:20.642 --> 33:23.309
H-he's a liar, Cody, and a murderer.

33:23.533 --> 33:24.899
Okay, well, then you won't have a problem

33:24.934 --> 33:26.601
coming to the hospital with me

33:26.636 --> 33:28.269
and telling him that to his face.

33:29.304 --> 33:31.138
You're serious?

33:31.207 --> 33:33.734
If you don't, then how can I trust you?

33:35.955 --> 33:38.281
All right, well, let's go.

33:44.296 --> 33:45.586
Carla.

33:45.622 --> 33:48.055
There's something you need to know.

33:48.091 --> 33:49.390
Now.

33:51.961 --> 33:53.227
Having fun?

33:53.263 --> 33:54.263
Mm-hmm.

33:54.297 --> 33:56.230
What was so urgent?

33:56.266 --> 33:57.431
It's Myron.

33:57.467 --> 33:59.100
He says he's heard that
the mole is at the party.

33:59.135 --> 34:01.235
The feds want to take
you down tonight, Hap.

34:01.271 --> 34:03.037
We need to plan "b" this.

34:03.749 --> 34:05.773
Myron needs to understand

34:05.808 --> 34:07.575
that we've got it all locked down.

34:07.644 --> 34:09.342
This is nothing but a witch-hunt.

34:09.379 --> 34:11.779
You're wrong. We need to protect ourselves.

34:11.813 --> 34:13.547
He says they want a Briggs.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.449
What if we gave them one?

34:19.155 --> 34:22.257
I'm not gonna hang one
of my children out to dry.

34:22.692 --> 34:24.725
But you have to admit it'd be a lot easier

34:24.761 --> 34:27.460
to get one of them out of this
mess than to save ourselves.

34:27.496 --> 34:31.431
Carla... I'm only gonna say this once,

34:31.467 --> 34:34.135
but I'm a little disappointed
that I even have to.

34:34.170 --> 34:37.545
I already have one ex-wife.

34:38.398 --> 34:40.474
If you ever even think

34:40.510 --> 34:42.944
about throwing my kids under the bus again,

34:42.978 --> 34:44.411
you'll be the second.

34:56.525 --> 34:58.159
Good evening.

35:00.196 --> 35:03.597
Mr. and Mrs. LeFever... I
was just about to call you.

35:05.101 --> 35:08.624
Gary LaFramboise passed a half-hour ago.

35:09.038 --> 35:10.137
He's dead.

35:10.173 --> 35:11.359
What?

35:11.653 --> 35:13.987
Yeah, the nurse said he
was conscious earlier,

35:14.210 --> 35:16.077
and that he spoke with you?

35:16.112 --> 35:17.845
Yeah.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.547
Can you tell me what he said?

35:25.388 --> 35:27.655
He wasn't making much sense, sheriff.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.054
He was really weak.

35:29.851 --> 35:32.727
He apologized for attacking me.

35:32.762 --> 35:36.265
But he... he didn't say
anything else about...

35:36.906 --> 35:38.199
The night he was injured?

35:38.234 --> 35:39.033
No.

35:39.068 --> 35:41.502
The rest was gibberish.

35:41.984 --> 35:43.270
That was it?

35:43.306 --> 35:45.206
Yeah.

35:50.596 --> 35:52.029
Good night.

36:07.867 --> 36:09.200
What? You idiot!

36:09.235 --> 36:11.869
You're the mole for the feds'
case against your father!

36:11.904 --> 36:14.271
What? What are you talking about, mom?

36:14.307 --> 36:15.806
I knew something was going on with you,

36:15.842 --> 36:17.174
but I couldn't put my finger on it.

36:17.742 --> 36:19.944
Your sister's booty call
seemed to know all about it.

36:19.979 --> 36:21.379
What were you thinking?

36:23.249 --> 36:25.082
He is gonna get what he deserves.

36:25.118 --> 36:26.118
Wick!

36:26.152 --> 36:28.406
He was sleeping with my girlfriend.

36:29.411 --> 36:31.077
I loved her.

36:33.234 --> 36:36.761
Nobody wants to see your
father burn more than I do,

36:36.796 --> 36:38.429
but he's your father.

36:38.464 --> 36:40.164
If he finds out
you're betraying him...

36:40.199 --> 36:41.532
It doesn't matter.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.167
He's going down,

36:43.202 --> 36:46.062
and that's all that matters to me.

36:53.208 --> 36:55.008
We got nothing.

36:55.554 --> 36:56.914
Let's say we shut it down for the night,

36:56.949 --> 36:58.640
live to fight another day.

36:59.185 --> 37:01.185
Get in here, Myron.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.720
I take it you don't have good news.

37:02.755 --> 37:04.955
Hap won't give up the kids.

37:05.843 --> 37:07.625
Doesn't Hap know they're gunning for him?

37:07.660 --> 37:10.928
Sometimes my husband doesn't
know what's best for him.

37:11.234 --> 37:12.701
That's why I'm here to protect him.

37:12.726 --> 37:14.231
Yeah, well, I am not
going down because of Hap's

37:14.267 --> 37:16.434
misguided sense of paternal loyalty.

37:16.469 --> 37:18.569
Neither one of us is going anywhere, Myron.

37:18.604 --> 37:20.004
East wing. Master bedroom.

37:20.039 --> 37:21.505
Here's what you're going to do.

37:21.541 --> 37:23.374
Backdate the visitors' log in your office

37:23.409 --> 37:25.406
to show that Lacey Briggs was there.

37:25.554 --> 37:26.644
When pressed, you'll remember

37:26.679 --> 37:29.346
that you left her alone long
enough to steal the report.

37:29.382 --> 37:31.782
You want me to alter state
records and commit perjury?

37:31.818 --> 37:33.551
Have you lost your damn mind, Carla?

37:33.586 --> 37:35.553
Oh, now you have a conscience?

37:35.781 --> 37:37.221
I knew this was a mistake
from the beginning.

37:37.256 --> 37:38.789
I never should have sold you that report.

37:38.829 --> 37:41.678
I never should have gotten
involved with you people.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.835
Stop acting like a little bitch.

37:45.960 --> 37:47.296
What's done is done.

37:47.362 --> 37:50.202
You will do what's necessary,
or you'll go down, too.

37:50.478 --> 37:51.544
Bingo.

37:51.569 --> 37:53.703
Okay, let's move.

38:05.463 --> 38:07.764
I'm gonna go stay with Jules for a while.

38:09.505 --> 38:11.787
I don't know if you did
what Gary said you did,

38:11.822 --> 38:13.989
but the fact that I don't know,

38:14.014 --> 38:16.098
that's a problem.

38:21.127 --> 38:22.226
Cody, hey.

38:22.251 --> 38:23.317
No. Just listen to me.

38:23.342 --> 38:25.109
Don't.
Just...

38:26.950 --> 38:28.489
I don't want to start talking now,

38:28.514 --> 38:30.480
because if we do, then I'm worried

38:30.505 --> 38:32.138
that I'm gonna say things

38:32.163 --> 38:34.231
that I'm just not ready to say, so...

38:35.395 --> 38:37.416
Just...

38:41.286 --> 38:43.652
Just give me some time, okay?

39:05.372 --> 39:06.942
FBI!

39:06.978 --> 39:09.244
Ladies and gentlemen, stay where you are.

39:10.442 --> 39:12.409
What the hell's going on?

39:16.787 --> 39:17.886
Excuse me. Step aside.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.154
Stand back. FBI.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.289
FBI.

39:20.324 --> 39:22.725
Do not move. Hands where I can see them.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.593
Carla Briggs, you're under arrest...

39:24.628 --> 39:26.862
- What?...
- For bribery of a public official,

39:26.905 --> 39:28.105
trading in influence...

39:28.132 --> 39:29.665
That's my wife.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.934
And violation of the Rico act.

39:32.528 --> 39:33.902
What the hell is this?

39:33.938 --> 39:36.438
It's a federal investigation.
Step back, Mr. Briggs.

39:36.474 --> 39:38.273
Well, we knew they wanted a Briggs.

39:38.309 --> 39:40.275
I'll get ahold of the lawyers in D.C.

39:40.311 --> 39:42.478
And I'll get you out as soon as possible.

39:42.848 --> 39:43.848
Carla...

39:45.207 --> 39:46.840
I love you.

39:47.286 --> 39:48.717
I love you, too.

39:48.753 --> 39:50.652
Could you allow the lady some dignity

39:50.688 --> 39:52.521
and take her out the back, please?

39:55.987 --> 39:57.037
Take her out the front.

39:57.062 --> 39:57.861
And you are?

39:57.886 --> 39:58.952
Agent Reese.

41:04.395 --> 41:05.575
Jules?

41:07.064 --> 41:08.430
Jules?

41:09.667 --> 41:11.967
Oh, my God.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.424
Jules!

41:17.044 --> 41:19.374
Jules! Jules!

41:19.410 --> 41:21.376
Wake up!

41:21.412 --> 41:22.211
Jules!

41:22.246 --> 41:23.632
Talk to me, Jules.
