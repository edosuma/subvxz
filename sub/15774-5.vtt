00:01.720 --> 00:04.717
Tina, I hear what you're saying. I do.

00:05.008 --> 00:07.085
I just feel that since you were with me

00:07.141 --> 00:08.768
when I got the parking ticket,

00:08.802 --> 00:10.102
you should pay half of it.

00:11.107 --> 00:13.172
I gotta go.
It's the other line.

00:13.207 --> 00:14.907
Hello.

00:14.942 --> 00:16.765
This is Daffy Duck.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.823
Oh, you know...

00:18.858 --> 00:22.494
I would love to go door to door
to help the mayor get reelected,

00:22.528 --> 00:25.569
but unfortunately, I'm not
a United States citizen,

00:25.603 --> 00:28.273
so I probably shouldn't get
involved with your politics.

00:30.206 --> 00:32.648
Where am I from? Uh...

00:34.150 --> 00:35.890
Albania.

00:35.924 --> 00:38.427
Albania.
I'm from Albania.

00:38.462 --> 00:40.130
Yes.

00:40.164 --> 00:42.903
I am, how
you say, visiting your country.

00:42.937 --> 00:46.913
So I sorry, but please to take
me off your phone list, ok?

00:46.947 --> 00:50.603
Adios. That's Albanian
for good-bye.

The Looney Tunes Show - Season 2 Episode 5
Semper Lie

01:04.501 --> 01:09.274
Original Air Date:
October 30, 2012

01:13.013 --> 01:15.482
Bugs, I hear what you're saying.

01:15.517 --> 01:17.718
I just feel that
since you're my roommate,

01:17.752 --> 01:19.787
you should pay
half of the parking ticket.

01:19.821 --> 01:22.524
Now, would this payment be in addition

01:22.559 --> 01:24.264
to letting you live here for free?

01:24.304 --> 01:25.638
Yes.

01:25.673 --> 01:27.207
Sounds like a great deal.

01:27.241 --> 01:28.503
It is a great deal.

01:28.542 --> 01:30.746
It's your chance to get in
on the ground floor.

01:30.780 --> 01:32.214
Today's the 14th.

01:32.248 --> 01:34.617
If I don't pay it today,
the fine doubles.

01:34.651 --> 01:37.120
- Today's the 14th? Oh, no.
- What?

01:37.154 --> 01:39.432
This weekend's
the annual peach festival.

01:39.469 --> 01:41.892
- Porky's gonna ask me to go with him.
- So?

01:41.927 --> 01:45.063
So I've gone there 3 years
in a row, and it's horrible.

01:45.098 --> 01:46.798
It takes 6 hours to get there.

01:46.832 --> 01:49.434
You're in the middle of nowhere
for the whole weekend.

01:49.468 --> 01:52.304
It's hot.
There's tons of mosquitoes.

01:52.338 --> 01:55.507
You stand in these long lines
for peach cobbler,

01:55.542 --> 01:58.410
peach soup, peach sandwiches...

01:58.445 --> 02:00.312
Yecch. Too much peach.

02:00.347 --> 02:02.081
Make up an excuse. Lie.

02:02.116 --> 02:04.084
I'm not gonna lie.
That's your area.

02:04.119 --> 02:05.712
Good point.
Know your role.

02:05.775 --> 02:08.590
But if it were me, I'd tell him I
can't go because I'm an alien.

02:08.624 --> 02:10.693
I'd say I look like Daffy
Duck on the outside,

02:10.727 --> 02:14.130
but I've been taken over by an
alien who lives on the inside.

02:14.164 --> 02:16.767
And why can't the alien
go to the peach festival?

02:16.801 --> 02:19.137
I don't know. He's got a
bunch of alien stuff to do.

02:19.171 --> 02:21.673
It doesn't matter.
He's not gonna ask that.

02:21.707 --> 02:24.576
All he'll be thinking about
is that I'm an alien.

02:24.610 --> 02:27.179
When are you going back to
your home planet?

02:27.213 --> 02:29.582
Just tell Porky you don't want to go.

02:29.616 --> 02:32.780
I can't do that. It would
break his little pig heart.

02:32.842 --> 02:35.656
Well, then, I guess you're
going to the peach festival.

02:47.306 --> 02:48.773
Hey, Porky.

02:48.844 --> 02:50.637
- Hey.
- How's it going?

02:50.671 --> 02:53.473
Oh, peachy. You know why?

02:53.507 --> 02:56.375
Because this weekend is
the peach festival!

02:56.409 --> 03:00.012
And this year, the theme is
dress as your favorite peach.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.982
Wow. That sounds...fun.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.752
What time should I pick you up?

03:05.787 --> 03:08.155
Listen, pork. Um...

03:08.189 --> 03:11.225
I don't think I can go
to the peach festival this year.

03:11.259 --> 03:14.689
What? We go every year.
It's our tradition.

03:14.775 --> 03:16.636
- I know.
- The peach soup!

03:16.728 --> 03:18.767
- I know.
- Why can't you go?

03:18.801 --> 03:21.403
Pork, the truth is,

03:21.438 --> 03:24.073
I promised Lola I'd do
something with her this weekend.

03:24.107 --> 03:27.583
Well, that's no reason not to go.
Bring her along.

03:27.622 --> 03:29.178
Oh, uh...

03:29.212 --> 03:32.114
I can't bring her along because...

03:32.149 --> 03:33.883
She's moving this weekend,

03:33.917 --> 03:37.254
and I have to help her.
I'm helping her move.

03:37.288 --> 03:38.956
So that's why I can't go.

03:38.990 --> 03:43.627
Oh, well, I'm disappointed,
but I understand.

03:43.662 --> 03:45.630
Thanks, Porky.

03:45.664 --> 03:48.700
Wow. That was easy.

04:03.651 --> 04:05.285
Oh. Hey, Daffy.

04:05.319 --> 04:07.353
I didn't know this was your bank, too.

04:07.388 --> 04:09.656
It's not.

04:09.690 --> 04:11.838
Then what are you doing here?

04:11.927 --> 04:14.496
Waiting to see if anyone drops money.

04:17.432 --> 04:19.666
0-8-1-2.

04:19.701 --> 04:21.302
What's the story behind that?

04:21.336 --> 04:22.736
Someone's birthday?

04:23.805 --> 04:25.473
You got a lot of money, Porky.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.913
Thanks.

04:34.607 --> 04:38.944
Oh, hey. You wanna go to
the peach festival with me?

04:38.989 --> 04:41.788
Can't.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.956
Why not?

04:42.991 --> 04:44.124
I'm not Daffy.

04:44.158 --> 04:46.593
I'm an alien that took over his body.

04:48.096 --> 04:51.498
Does the alien want to go to
the peach festival?

04:51.533 --> 04:52.900
Who would ask that?

04:52.934 --> 04:56.336
I don't think aliens eat peaches,
at least not the one in my body.

04:56.414 --> 04:58.112
Isn't Bugs going with you?

04:58.179 --> 05:00.107
He can't go.
He's helping Lola move.

05:00.141 --> 05:02.109
- Lola's moving?
- That's what he said.

05:02.143 --> 05:04.278
- Why is Lola moving?
- I don't know.

05:04.312 --> 05:06.580
- Where is she moving to?
- I'm not sure.

05:06.614 --> 05:09.649
Well, have a good weekend.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.685
Why would Lola be moving? She
just moved into her apartment.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.788
Bugs must have asked
Lola to move in with him!

05:15.823 --> 05:17.924
That house isn't big enough
for 3 people!

05:17.959 --> 05:19.626
That means I'm out!

05:19.660 --> 05:21.627
He's sending me
back to my home planet!

05:21.662 --> 05:23.496
But I don't have a home planet!

05:23.530 --> 05:25.664
I'm not an alien!

05:27.467 --> 05:29.534
Were you gonna drop any money?

05:30.240 --> 05:33.742
Shouldn't you be packing boxes?

05:34.507 --> 05:38.843
Oh! Hey, pork. Yeah.
Just grabbing a quick slice.

05:38.878 --> 05:41.279
Then, off to pack all those boxes.

05:41.314 --> 05:43.174
Shouldn't you be
at the peach festival?

05:43.213 --> 05:44.884
I'm getting a pizza for the road.

05:44.939 --> 05:46.827
Oh! Hey, Bugs.
Hey, Porky.

05:46.853 --> 05:50.579
- Lola! What are you doing here?
- I was just getting some lunch.

05:50.681 --> 05:52.691
Oh, we should all eat together.

05:52.726 --> 05:54.527
We can't.
You've gotta get on the road.

05:54.561 --> 05:56.996
- Oh, where are you going?
- Doesn't matter.

05:57.030 --> 05:58.397
The peach festival.

05:58.432 --> 06:00.299
How's Porky's pizza coming, speedy?

06:00.334 --> 06:02.532
Ooh, the peach festival?

06:02.579 --> 06:04.179
I've always wanted to go to that.

06:04.228 --> 06:06.339
Yep, it's a lot of fun.
Tons of fun.

06:06.373 --> 06:08.474
Speedy!

06:08.712 --> 06:11.513
Look, man, just because I'm fast
doesn't mean my oven's fast.

06:11.587 --> 06:13.379
It's a regular oven.

06:13.756 --> 06:16.615
Ok. You got your pizza.
It's time to hit the road.

06:16.649 --> 06:18.417
Oh! All right.

06:18.451 --> 06:21.554
- Well, have a great weekend.
- Phew.

06:21.588 --> 06:23.889
- Good luck with your move.
- Oh, boy.

06:23.924 --> 06:27.092
- What move?
- Bugs said he's helping you move this weekend.

06:27.126 --> 06:28.970
I'm not moving.
Why'd you tell him I was moving?

06:29.040 --> 06:31.363
Yeah. Why'd you say
Lola was moving?

06:31.397 --> 06:32.898
I didn't say Lola.

06:32.932 --> 06:35.500
I said viola.

06:35.535 --> 06:37.970
Viola.
Viola's moving.

06:38.004 --> 06:39.071
Who's Viola?

06:39.105 --> 06:40.940
You're asking me who viola is?

06:40.974 --> 06:42.275
Yeah. Who's viola?

06:42.309 --> 06:45.545
Viola's...my...sister.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.274
You have a sister?

06:47.352 --> 06:49.382
I didn't know you had a sister!

06:49.416 --> 06:51.790
Yeah, my big sister, Viola.

06:51.837 --> 06:53.386
How come we've never met her?

06:53.421 --> 06:57.524
Oh, well, she's shy.
Painfully shy.

06:57.558 --> 06:59.626
Well, we have to meet her
before she moves.

06:59.661 --> 07:01.294
That-that would be nice,

07:01.329 --> 07:05.031
but Porky's going to the peach
festival, so, you know, bye.

07:05.065 --> 07:07.266
Forget the peach festival!

07:07.301 --> 07:10.847
Meeting your sister's more
important than the peach festival.

07:11.096 --> 07:13.405
Yeah. We'll help you guys with the move.
Where does she live?

07:13.440 --> 07:14.673
Where does she live?

07:14.708 --> 07:16.842
Yeah, what's her address?

07:16.876 --> 07:18.310
Uh...

07:18.344 --> 07:20.478
463...

07:20.512 --> 07:21.512
Uh...

07:21.547 --> 07:23.214
Market street.

07:23.248 --> 07:26.117
Ooh.
That's a rough part of town.

07:26.152 --> 07:29.087
It is? I mean, I know.
That's why she's moving.

07:29.122 --> 07:31.523
Well, I better go cancel
my hotel reservation.

07:31.558 --> 07:33.959
Looks like I'm staying
in town this weekend.

07:33.993 --> 07:35.661
Porky, you really don't have to.

07:35.695 --> 07:37.195
See you tomorrow.

07:37.230 --> 07:39.965
Oh! I am so excited
to meet your sister!

07:39.999 --> 07:42.334
Lola, you're not gonna
meet my sister.

07:42.369 --> 07:43.602
What? Why?

07:43.636 --> 07:45.003
Because I don't have a sister!

07:45.038 --> 07:48.340
I lied to Porky so I wouldn't have to
go to the peach festival with him.

07:48.663 --> 07:52.565
Ok. First of all, you would never lie.
That's not your area.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.747
Second of all, who wouldn't
want to go to a peach festival?

07:56.082 --> 07:58.786
Third of all, I totally
see what's going on here.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.988
You don't want me to meet your sister because
you're afraid we'll become best friends,

08:02.050 --> 08:08.193
and then, I won't have any time for you.
Bun-bun, I will always have time for you.

08:08.227 --> 08:09.961
Always.

08:09.996 --> 08:11.930
Except right now.
This is my me time.

08:11.964 --> 08:14.466
I came in here to eat by myself.
You're kind of smothering me.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.835
♪ Boundaries ♪

08:18.304 --> 08:21.373
Excuse me? One of your fax
machines just ate my résumé.

08:21.407 --> 08:23.008
Bummer.

08:24.210 --> 08:26.011
- Can I move in with you?

08:26.045 --> 08:28.123
- What?
- Lola's moving into Bugs' house,

08:28.201 --> 08:30.048
so I'm out.
Let me live with you.

08:30.083 --> 08:33.018
Uh, I'm not living
with anyone till I'm married.

08:33.052 --> 08:34.986
Darling...

08:35.020 --> 08:37.655
No.

08:37.690 --> 08:40.424
Darling...

08:40.458 --> 08:43.128
I guess romance really is dead.

08:46.366 --> 08:49.033
Why did I have to say market street?

08:55.875 --> 08:58.410
Ooh. Poor viola.

08:59.821 --> 09:03.457
Ok. Now I have to fill it with a bunch
of furniture for tomorrow's move.

09:03.539 --> 09:05.485
Where am I gonna get
a bunch of furniture?

09:07.188 --> 09:09.756
Maybe I'm overreacting.

09:09.790 --> 09:12.118
Just because Lola's moving in
doesn't mean I'm out.

09:12.165 --> 09:14.094
They probably want me
to live with them.

09:14.129 --> 09:18.032
I'm the fun guy.
They need me here.

09:18.066 --> 09:20.968
Mother!

09:29.490 --> 09:32.216
This neighborhood's
even worse than I thought.

09:32.271 --> 09:33.864
I hope my car's ok out there.

09:33.958 --> 09:37.330
Oh, where did viola get this furniture?
It's hideous.

09:37.375 --> 09:41.140
Well, I didn't exactly have a lot
of time to get anything better.

09:41.421 --> 09:43.970
- Huh?
- I mean, uh, when I picked out the furniture

09:44.046 --> 09:45.921
when she moved in all those years ago.

09:45.945 --> 09:47.507
Mm. That's a weird place
to put a bed.

09:47.546 --> 09:50.701
It's a fine place to put a bed.

09:51.039 --> 09:53.807
It's too bad viola had
to work on a Saturday.

09:53.860 --> 09:57.340
Yep. I know. She really wanted
to meet you guys.

09:57.375 --> 10:01.078
Why does her dresser say
"Property of Daffy Duck"?

10:01.112 --> 10:06.992
Huh? Oh. Well, she and Daffy
had a thing in college.

10:07.048 --> 10:08.415
It didn't end well.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.235
- Daffy went to college?
- Just pick up a box.

10:17.916 --> 10:22.985
Well, we did it. Viola's all moved
out, so I'll take it from here.

10:23.032 --> 10:24.804
Well, we can go with you
to her new place.

10:24.851 --> 10:26.112
Ooh, that's a great idea.

10:26.134 --> 10:29.307
- She's gonna need help moving in.
- No.

10:29.645 --> 10:31.335
- I mean, you can't.
- Why not?

10:31.411 --> 10:34.044
Her new place is
really, really far away.

10:34.078 --> 10:36.539
- Where is it?
- Very, very far.

10:36.664 --> 10:38.748
She's moving to...
Uh...

10:38.783 --> 10:40.259
Albania.

10:40.337 --> 10:41.618
Al-Albania?

10:41.723 --> 10:44.400
Well, then why did we load up
a trailer with all of her stuff?

10:44.481 --> 10:45.918
You can't drive to Albania.

10:45.957 --> 10:47.962
Huh? Oh. Right.

10:47.994 --> 10:51.664
That's why I was gonna drive
to, uh, a shipping company.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.365
You ship stuff to Albania.
Everyone knows that.

10:57.142 --> 11:01.011
So, you wanna ship everything
in that trailer to Albania.

11:01.064 --> 11:05.409
No. I just said that outside
in front of those crazy people.

11:05.444 --> 11:07.978
I actually just need this
all shipped back to my house.

11:08.013 --> 11:09.513
Here's the address.

11:09.548 --> 11:13.918
This is, like, 5 minutes from here. It'd
be a lot cheaper just to drive it there.

11:13.953 --> 11:16.321
I'm well aware of that.

11:16.856 --> 11:18.545
Hmm.

11:18.582 --> 11:21.025
That'll be $1,248.

11:26.822 --> 11:28.222
Peach?

11:28.393 --> 11:29.963
No, thanks.

11:30.829 --> 11:32.408
So, let me get this straight.

11:32.409 --> 11:35.219
For the next 8 years, you're
gonna give me a place to live,

11:35.275 --> 11:37.161
you're gonna provide me
with all my meals,

11:37.192 --> 11:38.592
and you're gonna pay me?

11:38.650 --> 11:40.551
That's an even better deal than I had!

11:40.598 --> 11:44.083
- Where do I sign up?
- Right here.

11:44.492 --> 11:47.027
Welcome to the Marines.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.888
This is gonna be fun.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.926
I've always liked marine life.

11:50.996 --> 11:53.198
I had a goldfish when I was a kid.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.861
Gene.
Gene the goldfish.

11:55.895 --> 11:59.131
No, Gordon.
Gordon the goldfish.

11:59.165 --> 12:01.133
Or was it Gary?

12:08.940 --> 12:11.608
You know, you guys can go.
You don't have to wait.

12:11.643 --> 12:15.548
But isn't viola staying here tonight so
you can take her to the airport tomorrow?

12:15.587 --> 12:17.121
- Did I say that?
- Mm-hmm.

12:17.165 --> 12:19.552
Then I guess she's staying here.

12:19.587 --> 12:22.956
Excuse me for just a second.

12:22.991 --> 12:24.592
Glass of water.

12:27.763 --> 12:29.196
This is Speedy.

12:29.226 --> 12:31.609
Hey. Do me a favor.
Call me back in one minute.

12:31.645 --> 12:32.946
What?

12:35.644 --> 12:38.512
- Where's your water?
- Huh? Oh. We're out.

12:40.709 --> 12:43.411
It's Viola!

12:43.445 --> 12:45.805
Oh, hi, Viola!

12:45.837 --> 12:47.638
- Viola?
- What's that?

12:47.703 --> 12:50.272
You're stuck at work and won't
be home till after midnight?

12:50.338 --> 12:52.005
Oh, I see what's going on.

12:52.063 --> 12:56.023
You're pretending I'm some fictional person
saying lines I'm not saying. I get it.

12:56.456 --> 12:59.792
Ok.
I'll let them know.

12:59.834 --> 13:04.037
Heh. Yes. I'll tell them how disappointed
you are that you didn't get to meet them.

13:04.106 --> 13:06.295
Tsk, tsk.
It's gonna snowball.

13:06.313 --> 13:07.847
It's gonna get out of control, man.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.122
It already has.

13:09.176 --> 13:11.871
Ok, viola.
Thanks for calling.

13:11.917 --> 13:15.082
I mean, I expect this kind of thing from the
duck, but not you, Bugs.

13:15.144 --> 13:17.178
That's not your area. Know your role.

13:17.212 --> 13:19.013
Heh. Ok.

13:19.047 --> 13:21.593
I'm telling you,
this is gonna end badly, man.

13:21.632 --> 13:22.811
I love you, too.

13:22.842 --> 13:24.408
Oh, can I at least say hi to her?

13:24.475 --> 13:26.917
Uh--I lost her.
She went into a tunnel.

13:26.956 --> 13:28.531
I thought you said she was at work.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.892
Oh, right. She is.
Yeah. She works in tunnels.

13:31.962 --> 13:33.262
She's a tunneler.

13:33.306 --> 13:35.061
Okey doke.
Well, we tried.

13:35.095 --> 13:39.766
Thanks for everything today.
It was so helpful.

13:40.082 --> 13:43.218
You know, I think I have
a cousin who's a tunneler.

13:43.285 --> 13:45.699
Viola and I would have had
so much in common.

13:45.730 --> 13:48.175
So much to talk about.

13:52.380 --> 13:56.083
Now, I definitely like
to take risks with my hairstyle,

13:56.117 --> 13:58.185
but I don't wanna be
a victim to trends.

13:58.219 --> 14:00.754
Obviously, I'm not afraid
to use product.

14:00.789 --> 14:03.357
It's definitely helpful
with texture and body.

14:03.391 --> 14:05.892
But I don't wanna be
a slave to product.

14:05.927 --> 14:07.995
There are times
when I wanna look polished,

14:08.029 --> 14:10.530
and then, there are times
when I wanna wash and go.

14:10.565 --> 14:13.833
So what I'd love is for this
haircut to be able to do both.

14:18.204 --> 14:19.638
That's a great haircut.

14:20.163 --> 14:24.710
And I'm a licensed cosmetologist,
so I know what I'm talking about.

14:33.759 --> 14:34.725
Lights out!

14:35.827 --> 14:38.161
"Reveille" is at 0500!

14:38.196 --> 14:42.149
They even turn the lights out for you!
This place is incredible!

14:42.195 --> 14:44.359
Get your sleep!
You're gonna need it!

14:44.405 --> 14:46.537
- That guy yells a lot, but I like him.

14:46.569 --> 14:50.042
I think he's nice. I just
really like the Marines so far.

14:50.076 --> 14:53.679
Good night, Corchran.

14:53.713 --> 14:55.314
Oh, hey, Corchran,

14:55.348 --> 14:57.621
I set my alarm for 11:30,

14:57.666 --> 15:00.911
but don't be afraid to wake me
if the guys go whale watching

15:00.935 --> 15:03.636
or some other fun
marine thing like that.

15:07.514 --> 15:10.115
Psst. Corchran.
On second thought,

15:10.157 --> 15:11.925
forget about getting me up early.

15:11.982 --> 15:13.900
You could just tell me
about the whale watching.

15:13.934 --> 15:17.770
Mama needs her beauty sleep.
You know what I mean?

15:23.844 --> 15:26.179
What the-

15:27.875 --> 15:29.709
Hello?

15:29.751 --> 15:31.618
- Where are you guys?
- Huh?

15:31.653 --> 15:35.413
We're at the airport. Viola's
flight boards in less than an hour.

15:35.442 --> 15:37.659
- How do you know that?
- We called the airport.

15:37.693 --> 15:40.148
This is the only flight
to Albania today.

15:40.179 --> 15:43.533
Of course it is.
I mean, we're stuck in traffic,

15:43.583 --> 15:45.133
so we'll be there soon.

15:45.167 --> 15:48.870
Man, I wish I was
at that peach festival.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.243
Get up, get up, get up.

15:54.278 --> 15:56.312
Look alive, Jackanapes.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.514
Get a move on!

15:58.548 --> 16:00.550
- Anders.
- Sir, yes, sir!

16:00.584 --> 16:02.218
- Bonitez!
- Sir, yes, sir!

16:02.252 --> 16:03.986
- Corchran!
- Sir, yes, sir!

16:04.020 --> 16:05.621
Duck!

16:05.656 --> 16:07.957
Duck! Daffy Duck!

16:22.964 --> 16:25.766
Uh, I'm sorry.
There must be some mistake.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.693
I was gonna sleep in this morning.

16:27.721 --> 16:31.283
I thought I made that clear
to Corchran.

16:31.377 --> 16:33.817
Oh, you guys going to breakfast?

16:33.851 --> 16:36.520
I'd join you, but I'm gonna try and get a
little more shut-eye.

16:36.614 --> 16:39.410
Don't worry about me. I'll just
grab a granola bar or something--

16:39.434 --> 16:41.142
Listen to me, you little maggot.

16:41.188 --> 16:44.103
From now on, you will speak
only when spoken to!

16:44.150 --> 16:48.372
You're about to endure more pain and
suffering than you ever thought possible!

16:48.437 --> 16:50.531
And it only gets worse from there!

16:50.594 --> 16:54.094
This is not summer camp.
This is not finishing school.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.851
This is your worst nightmare!

16:55.921 --> 16:59.811
This is the United States
marine corps!

16:59.846 --> 17:03.582
Ohh! That Marines.

17:09.736 --> 17:13.505
And I thought it would be bad to
be dressed as my favorite peach.

17:14.111 --> 17:15.944
Oh, look!
That must be Viola!

17:16.126 --> 17:18.184
Bugs obviously got
the looks in the family.

17:18.259 --> 17:19.413
Viola?

17:19.449 --> 17:20.955
That's me!

17:20.996 --> 17:23.675
Ohh! It's like I have a sister!

17:23.702 --> 17:24.801
Where's Bugs?

17:24.836 --> 17:28.039
Oh. Heh.
He dropped me off out front.

17:28.073 --> 17:30.074
Mmm. Couldn't handle
a long good-bye.

17:30.108 --> 17:31.475
That is so him.

17:31.510 --> 17:34.936
You know, underneath that cool
exterior and all that sarcasm,

17:34.967 --> 17:37.858
he's just a vulnerable little
bunny in need of a good cry.

17:37.905 --> 17:40.817
Yeah.
He wants to cry, all right.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.854
Now boarding, flight 787 to Albania.

17:43.888 --> 17:48.091
Well, you guys
should probably get going.

17:48.125 --> 17:52.695
Oh, wait. I made you these traditional
Albanian dumplings for the flight.

17:52.730 --> 17:55.431
And I got you this Albanian flag.

17:55.465 --> 17:58.940
Well, it's a Mexican flag. They
didn't have an Albanian flag.

17:58.979 --> 18:00.658
It's probably in the ballpark, though.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.566
I can't believe we all just met,
and now, you're going to Albania.

18:03.620 --> 18:06.108
I can't believe
I'm going to Albania, either.

18:06.142 --> 18:10.078
This is the final boarding
call for flight 787.

18:13.282 --> 18:17.386
Look at me, going to Albania.

18:17.420 --> 18:19.488
Make sure you look out
the window when you take off!

18:19.522 --> 18:21.390
We'll be waving!

18:21.424 --> 18:23.792
Of course you will.

18:47.450 --> 18:49.284
Problem?

18:54.763 --> 18:58.599
I'm not a spy! There's a
simple explanation for this!

18:58.667 --> 19:02.518
I was dressed as a woman because I
was pretending to be my fake sister

19:02.549 --> 19:06.435
so that I didn't have to go to
the peach festival with Porky!

19:06.469 --> 19:09.605
Oh, boy.

19:09.639 --> 19:11.340
How you doing?

20:09.764 --> 20:11.131
Who are you?

20:11.165 --> 20:13.333
We're the United States Marines.

20:13.367 --> 20:15.368
You're coming home.

20:27.850 --> 20:30.485
- Bugs?
- Daffy?

20:30.519 --> 20:32.587
What are you doing
in an Albanian prison?

20:32.621 --> 20:34.389
What are you doing in the Marines?

20:34.423 --> 20:37.235
I needed somewhere to go after
you kicked me out of the house!

20:39.929 --> 20:42.830
I didn't kick you out of the house.

20:42.865 --> 20:47.401
Then why did you tell Porky
you were helping Lola move?

20:47.436 --> 20:50.505
I just told him so I wouldn't
have to go to the peach festival.

20:50.539 --> 20:52.794
You lied?

20:52.848 --> 20:56.010
- Who told you to lie?
- You did!

20:56.044 --> 20:58.613
You're not a liar!
That's my area!

21:00.015 --> 21:03.250
Know your role!

21:07.489 --> 21:10.024
You mean it was all a lie?
Why didn't you tell me?

21:10.059 --> 21:11.659
I did tell you!

21:11.694 --> 21:15.897
Oh. Right.
You totally told me.

21:16.181 --> 21:19.183
Bugs! I can't imagine
what you've been through.

21:19.228 --> 21:22.268
Being in prison for a year?
How did it happen?

21:22.313 --> 21:24.539
Well, it's kind of a long story.

21:24.573 --> 21:26.917
Perfect.
You can tell us in the car.

21:26.956 --> 21:29.017
The car?
Where are we going?

21:29.055 --> 21:31.952
- This weekend's the peach festival!
- You're kidding.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.183
I can't believe
you got out when you did.

21:34.237 --> 21:37.909
A few more days, and you would have missed
the peach festival two years in a row!

21:37.980 --> 21:40.321
You're so lucky.

21:40.355 --> 21:42.556
So lucky.

21:46.898 --> 21:49.665
Well, at least I'll never
run out of pickled peaches.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.800
What are you doing here?

21:51.835 --> 21:54.970
I'm not cut out
for the Marines. Too hard.

21:55.137 --> 21:57.404
- And they just let you out?
- No.

21:57.439 --> 21:59.188
Then how'd you get out?

21:59.244 --> 22:01.962
Flat feet. Ooh, pickled peaches!
