00:00.108 --> 00:01.336
Previously on "The Catch"...

00:01.338 --> 00:03.227
Tessa Riley. Is that your real name?

00:03.229 --> 00:05.198
Perhaps you should go
directly to the source.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.200
Tell us, Mum.

00:06.202 --> 00:08.503
You made the right
decision, giving her up.

00:08.505 --> 00:09.971
Parenting's a cruel business.

00:09.973 --> 00:12.039
How many times have you
tried to kill me now and failed?

00:12.041 --> 00:13.273
You can't do it, can you?

00:13.275 --> 00:16.044
Because deep down, you
know, I'm your little girl.

00:16.046 --> 00:17.544
You think he's targeting Sybil?

00:17.546 --> 00:18.683
She's on 24-hour lockdown.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.746
She's being extradited.

00:19.748 --> 00:20.614
Hello, mother.

00:20.616 --> 00:21.748
What on earth are you doing?

00:21.750 --> 00:23.551
It's a prison break, darling.

00:23.553 --> 00:25.488
The mayor's appointing
his new Chief of Police.

00:25.490 --> 00:27.187
I need to know where I'm vulnerable.

00:27.189 --> 00:28.789
I want to hire you guys,

00:28.791 --> 00:30.657
starting with the Ethan Ward case.

00:30.659 --> 00:31.925
Tommy's in trouble.

00:31.927 --> 00:34.127
- You didn't have to pay his bail.
- He's family.

00:34.129 --> 00:36.230
Ethan is very well-connected.

00:36.232 --> 00:38.665
Nothing for six years,
and then twice in one day.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.133
- Are you happy?
- I am.

00:40.135 --> 00:42.469
Once word spreads
that I'm setting people up

00:42.471 --> 00:44.538
for the feds, you're
giving me a death sentence.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.640
Maybe we should take the Nick case.

00:46.642 --> 00:48.809
If there's stuff in my life
that I'm afraid to look at,

00:48.811 --> 00:50.077
then maybe I should look at it.

00:50.079 --> 00:52.045
The past will always
come back to haunt you.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.645 --> 01:23.910
I love you.

01:23.912 --> 01:25.946
Very good.

01:25.948 --> 01:27.447
That's exactly how you're
gonna start your pitch

01:27.449 --> 01:28.776
to the City Planning Commission.

01:28.778 --> 01:30.651
- Is that today?
- Don't even joke.

01:30.653 --> 01:32.386
What else are you gonna say to them?

01:32.388 --> 01:36.657
That they, um... smell fantastic.

01:36.659 --> 01:40.427
And that I would like to stay
in bed with them all day long.

01:40.429 --> 01:42.129
Well, they're gonna love you.

01:43.399 --> 01:44.965
They already hate me.

01:44.967 --> 01:47.135
I'm "the man who's destroying downtown."

01:47.137 --> 01:50.207
You are the man who's rebuilding
downtown, restoring downtown.

01:50.209 --> 01:51.605
You're the one that should be meeting

01:51.607 --> 01:53.173
with the City Planning Commission.

01:53.175 --> 01:54.908
I'm taking bids on the new sports arena.

01:54.910 --> 01:56.677
Oh.

01:56.679 --> 01:58.578
Why do you always get
to do the fun stuff?

01:58.580 --> 02:00.380
Because your name is on the letterhead.

02:00.382 --> 02:03.650
Yours is there, too...
Ethan Ward and Associates.

02:03.652 --> 02:06.087
It's not the same as Ward
& Vaughan, though, is it?

02:06.089 --> 02:07.621
When are you gonna make me a partner?

02:07.623 --> 02:09.622
When are you gonna marry me?

02:09.625 --> 02:11.625
Then nobody will take me seriously.

02:11.627 --> 02:13.660
Mm.

02:13.662 --> 02:16.663
Okay. I'll retire.

02:16.665 --> 02:18.465
You can run the
business all by yourself.

02:18.467 --> 02:20.133
- Mm.
- I'll just raise the kids.

02:20.135 --> 02:22.470
- Kids?
- Oh, absolutely, yeah.

02:22.472 --> 02:23.737
We can start making them right now.

02:32.264 --> 02:34.247
Police! Let me see your
hands! Face the wall.

02:34.249 --> 02:35.282
- What?
- Don't move.

02:35.284 --> 02:36.717
Ethan Ward, I'm Detective Anderson.

02:36.719 --> 02:37.784
This is Detective Turner.

02:37.786 --> 02:39.119
We have a warrant for your arrest...

02:39.121 --> 02:40.620
- Ethan!
- For the murder of Steven Mason.

02:40.622 --> 02:41.688
Hey, stop! This is a mistake.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.323
- You have the right to remain silent...
- What are you doing?

02:43.325 --> 02:44.591
- Stay back, ma'am.
- Allie, it's fine.

02:44.593 --> 02:45.660
You can't just take him.

02:45.662 --> 02:47.504
- For your own safety, ma'am.
- Allie, stop!

02:51.567 --> 02:53.333
Congratulations, Ms. Vaughan.

02:53.335 --> 02:56.637
You're under arrest for
assaulting a police officer.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.515
_

03:08.517 --> 03:11.230
You think it's safe leaving
Tessa alone in her room?

03:11.232 --> 03:13.299
Safe for her, or safe for us?

03:13.301 --> 03:16.235
I put a guard outside the door.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.869
So, I assume you have a
laundry list of questions.

03:28.871 --> 03:31.171
Obviously, I lied to you 15 years ago.

03:31.173 --> 03:33.173
There was no Barcelona assignment...

03:33.175 --> 03:36.143
I figured out the when and the how...

03:36.145 --> 03:39.279
but just not the why.

03:39.281 --> 03:40.981
I mean, if you knew she was mine...

03:40.983 --> 03:42.015
Of course she was yours.

03:42.017 --> 03:43.316
Then why not tell me?

03:44.219 --> 03:47.087
Because I knew you'd want
to do the right thing...

03:47.089 --> 03:49.957
Settle down and be a "family."

03:49.959 --> 03:51.158
And would that have been so bad?

03:51.160 --> 03:52.392
Yes.

03:52.394 --> 03:56.163
I liked our life, yours and mine.

03:56.165 --> 03:57.764
Well, I did, too, but...

03:57.766 --> 03:59.566
A baby would have changed everything.

03:59.568 --> 04:02.202
We should have made
that decision together.

04:02.204 --> 04:03.637
A decision about my body?

04:03.639 --> 04:06.606
I'm just saying, if we had...

04:06.608 --> 04:08.642
maybe things would have
turned out differently.

04:08.644 --> 04:12.554
Right, 'cause having a baby
always saves a relationship.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.448
Look, you want to make
decisions about her?

04:14.450 --> 04:15.582
Fine. Take her.

04:15.584 --> 04:16.983
- She's yours.
- What?

04:16.985 --> 04:19.452
She hates me... something
the two of you have in common.

04:19.454 --> 04:21.120
- Take her.
- Margot, I am working

04:21.123 --> 04:22.155
undercover for the FBI.

04:22.157 --> 04:24.291
- What do you suggest?
- I don't know.

04:24.293 --> 04:26.794
I would just like to
be involved in her life.

04:26.796 --> 04:29.041
Mm-hmm. You're just gonna
leave her here, aren't you?

04:29.043 --> 04:30.263
For now.

04:30.265 --> 04:32.332
But I will be right back, and
first thing in the morning,

04:32.334 --> 04:34.067
we can all talk, figure
out what Tessa wants.

04:34.069 --> 04:35.502
Tessa wants to join the Firm.

04:35.504 --> 04:37.705
No. She's not gonna
turn out like we did.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.039
She already has.

04:41.109 --> 04:44.678
Don't you think we at
least owe her a chance

04:44.680 --> 04:46.046
to lead a normal life?

04:53.722 --> 04:55.789
We don't have to do this.

04:55.791 --> 04:58.024
I can just tell Nick we're too busy.

04:58.026 --> 04:59.359
He'll know that you're lying.

04:59.361 --> 05:01.661
Plus, if he does become Chief of Police,

05:01.663 --> 05:03.096
I want us to stay on his good side.

05:03.098 --> 05:05.198
And you sure now is the best time,

05:05.200 --> 05:07.901
with you becoming a... stepmother?

05:07.903 --> 05:10.403
That is strictly between Ben and Margot.

05:10.405 --> 05:12.038
I'm not even thinking about Tessa

05:12.040 --> 05:13.740
and the many ways in which she could

05:13.742 --> 05:15.408
completely destroy my life.

05:15.410 --> 05:19.579
Which is why I need this case...

05:19.581 --> 05:22.582
so I can stop worrying about the future

05:22.584 --> 05:27.320
and to figure out how I
got here in the first place.

05:28.524 --> 05:30.357
Through the course
of this investigation,

05:30.359 --> 05:33.560
you will learn some things about
me that I am not very proud of.

05:33.562 --> 05:35.929
So whatever you read in
those files, just know...

05:35.931 --> 05:37.731
It's all in the past.

05:37.733 --> 05:40.921
Our job is to remain
objective, reserve judgment,

05:40.924 --> 05:43.215
and treat this case
like we would any other.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.038
Who's asking us to dig into this?

05:45.040 --> 05:48.341
Nick Turner. He's up
for Chief of Police.

05:48.343 --> 05:49.943
He has hired us to vet his record,

05:49.945 --> 05:51.745
which is flawless except for one case.

05:51.747 --> 05:55.348
In September 2009, when
Nick and I were partners,

05:55.350 --> 05:57.551
we were tasked with
investigating the murder

05:57.553 --> 06:00.120
of a fellow detective... Steven Mason.

06:00.122 --> 06:02.022
Detective Mason was last seen

06:02.024 --> 06:03.924
entering a warehouse on the L.A. River.

06:03.926 --> 06:06.192
Approximately 30 minutes
after he entered the warehouse,

06:06.194 --> 06:08.728
it exploded with Detective Mason inside.

06:08.730 --> 06:11.264
- Arson?
- Gas leak. Allegedly.

06:11.266 --> 06:12.966
What was he doing in the warehouse?

06:14.102 --> 06:15.936
Looking into a commercial developer

06:15.938 --> 06:18.038
suspected of corrupt
business practices...

06:18.040 --> 06:19.539
Bribery, extortion.

06:19.541 --> 06:21.207
Who was the developer?

06:21.209 --> 06:22.776
Ethan Ward.

06:25.981 --> 06:27.547
He's my ex-boyfriend.

06:27.549 --> 06:29.583
We were together for five years.

06:29.585 --> 06:31.151
I helped him build his company.

06:31.153 --> 06:34.257
In the six months prior
to Detective Mason's death,

06:34.260 --> 06:36.660
Ethan bought up all of
the riverfront property.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.897
The owner of that warehouse
was the last holdout.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.466
Until the fire.

06:43.908 --> 06:45.441
So, Ethan gets the property,

06:45.443 --> 06:47.476
and the cop investigating him goes away.

06:47.478 --> 06:48.744
Which gives him motive.

06:48.746 --> 06:50.780
Ethan was arrested, but
the charges were dropped.

06:50.782 --> 06:53.549
A cop was murdered,
and it just went away?

06:53.551 --> 06:56.118
Do you think he paid people off?

06:56.761 --> 06:58.661
That's what we're gonna find out.

06:58.664 --> 07:01.231
Ethan didn't do this.

07:01.234 --> 07:02.792
How do you know that, Ms. Vaughan?

07:02.794 --> 07:04.794
Because I was with him last night.

07:04.796 --> 07:06.996
- All night?
- Yeah.

07:06.998 --> 07:08.865
We went to dinner. We went to the club.

07:08.867 --> 07:10.366
We met friends. We had drinks.

07:10.368 --> 07:11.200
Just drinks?

07:12.284 --> 07:14.804
You sure you didn't put anything
else in your system last night?

07:14.806 --> 07:16.339
And what are you implying, Detective?

07:16.341 --> 07:18.808
You punched a cop, Ms. Vaughan...

07:18.810 --> 07:20.710
at 6:45 in the morning.

07:20.712 --> 07:23.412
And I am very sorry I did that.
My home was being invaded.

07:23.414 --> 07:25.948
My boyfriend was being arrested
for something that he didn't do.

07:25.950 --> 07:28.384
I have a temper, not a drug problem.

07:28.386 --> 07:30.750
What time did you leave the club?

07:30.753 --> 07:32.352
I don't know. 2:00?

07:32.355 --> 07:34.390
And Mr. Ward left with you?

07:34.392 --> 07:36.626
Mm-hmm.

07:36.628 --> 07:39.195
We took a cab.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.497
You can check my credit
card to see what time it was.

07:41.499 --> 07:43.766
And then you and Mr. Ward went to...

07:43.768 --> 07:48.037
Sleep. Well to bed.

07:48.039 --> 07:49.772
There's plenty of genetic evidence there

07:49.774 --> 07:52.241
if you need proof that
he was home last night.

07:55.747 --> 07:57.513
The family's here.

08:00.588 --> 08:02.788
Do you hear that, Ms. Vaughan?

08:02.791 --> 08:05.493
Detective Mason's
family is right outside.

08:08.660 --> 08:12.629
A man with a wife and two kids...

08:12.631 --> 08:14.529
who will grow up without a father

08:14.532 --> 08:16.131
because of your boyfriend.

08:19.104 --> 08:21.237
If you had any evidence
to support that claim,

08:21.239 --> 08:24.107
you wouldn't be working me
so hard, would you, Detective?

08:24.109 --> 08:27.510
You've got nothing on Ethan
because he didn't do this.

08:27.512 --> 08:30.814
So unless you have further questions...

08:30.816 --> 08:34.484
I will let you get back to
figuring out who really did.

08:36.888 --> 08:38.955
We'll start by going through

08:38.957 --> 08:40.789
Detective Mason's personal case files.

08:40.792 --> 08:42.659
At the time, he was investigating Ethan

08:42.660 --> 08:44.561
for corruption, graft, fraud.

08:44.563 --> 08:46.296
You want us to retrace his steps?

08:48.033 --> 08:51.301
I want to know if Ethan did this.

08:51.303 --> 08:53.937
And how he got away with it.

08:58.243 --> 09:00.043
Don't move.

09:04.182 --> 09:05.548
Stand down!

09:05.550 --> 09:07.317
Stand down. He's one of ours.

09:07.319 --> 09:09.118
- All clear.
- What the hell is going on?

09:09.120 --> 09:10.453
Thank God you're not dead.

09:10.455 --> 09:11.688
Why would I be dead?

09:11.690 --> 09:13.089
Because we've been made.

09:13.091 --> 09:14.557
- What?
- Not necessarily.

09:14.559 --> 09:16.278
The whole world knows we're C.I.s.

09:16.281 --> 09:17.861
- Agent Diaz...
- We don't know that.

09:17.863 --> 09:19.796
What is going on?

09:19.798 --> 09:22.498
There's been a security
breach at the FBI.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.902
And there's a chance that
you've both been compromised.

09:25.904 --> 09:27.537
Which means we have been compromised.

09:27.539 --> 09:29.038
Which means we're dead.

09:31.052 --> 09:32.342
You've killed us.

09:36.950 --> 09:39.500
Last night, someone broke
into our L.A. field office.

09:39.503 --> 09:42.237
They accessed a drive with files

09:42.240 --> 09:44.342
detailing the names and locations

09:44.344 --> 09:48.112
of all of our undercover
agents and criminal informants.

09:48.114 --> 09:49.313
They just accessed it.

09:49.315 --> 09:51.148
Well, we've been trying
to figure out how.

09:51.150 --> 09:53.251
Well, luckily, I packed
a couple of go-bags,

09:53.253 --> 09:55.353
so Benji and I are off to Mykonos,

09:55.355 --> 09:57.622
if you'd care to join us.

09:57.624 --> 09:59.048
I'm afraid I can't let you leave.

09:59.051 --> 10:01.713
- Well, you can't expect us to stay.
- They know where we live.

10:01.716 --> 10:04.450
Which is why we'll have agents
stationed here day and night.

10:04.453 --> 10:06.556
If the criminals we set
up know where to find us,

10:06.559 --> 10:08.586
that means we're all
dead if we stay here.

10:08.588 --> 10:10.055
So, what are you doing
to recover those files?

10:10.057 --> 10:11.456
We're investigating the break-in.

10:11.458 --> 10:12.957
Then we need to be a part
of that investigation.

10:12.959 --> 10:14.859
No. That runs contrary to protocol.

10:14.861 --> 10:16.795
Okay, while you're
worrying about protocol,

10:16.797 --> 10:19.731
Rhys and I are gonna figure out who
did this and get those files back

10:19.733 --> 10:21.866
before the FBI makes its first move.

10:21.868 --> 10:24.336
Fine. I'll make some calls.

10:28.342 --> 10:30.875
Listen...

10:30.877 --> 10:32.911
Are we absolutely sure

10:32.913 --> 10:34.646
we wouldn't rather be
on a beach somewhere?

10:34.648 --> 10:36.214
I can't leave, not now.

10:36.216 --> 10:37.716
Why not? Alice is fine.

10:37.718 --> 10:40.218
Alice would want you to
go if it keeps you alive.

10:40.220 --> 10:42.120
Alice isn't the problem.

10:42.122 --> 10:43.621
Well, then, what is it?

10:43.623 --> 10:48.693
Your niece... My daughter with Margot.

10:50.030 --> 10:52.764
I know. Take a moment.

10:52.766 --> 10:55.300
It's a lot.

10:58.538 --> 11:01.172
Gentlemen, on page three
you will find our revised

11:01.174 --> 11:03.708
revenue projections
for Canada, the U.S.,

11:03.710 --> 11:05.543
Central and South America.

11:07.247 --> 11:09.632
Sorry. Uh, would anyone like tea?

11:09.635 --> 11:11.335
Alfie, Darjeeling... Your favorite.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.738
Why, yes, I'd love a cup of...

11:12.741 --> 11:14.607
Mum, I'm just trying
to conduct a meeting.

11:14.610 --> 11:16.488
Of course, darling. Tea?

11:16.490 --> 11:18.356
No. Thank you.

11:18.358 --> 11:19.891
As I was saying...

11:19.893 --> 11:22.160
Sorry, but do these revenue projections

11:22.162 --> 11:23.962
take into account our pirate problem?

11:23.964 --> 11:25.505
We have a pirate problem?

11:25.508 --> 11:28.042
In the Gulf. They've stolen
four shipments in as many days.

11:28.045 --> 11:30.245
Well, they must be working
with inside information.

11:30.248 --> 11:31.848
Who do we have down
there in enforcement?

11:31.851 --> 11:35.386
Uh... Stefan, Miguel, Fernando.

11:35.388 --> 11:37.622
Fernando... He's ambitious. Send him.

11:37.624 --> 11:40.057
Yes, Mum?

11:40.059 --> 11:41.692
Darling, I-I don't
mean to meddle, but...

11:41.694 --> 11:43.594
Do we have any more of
those butter biscuits?

11:43.596 --> 11:44.629
I've eaten all mine.

11:44.631 --> 11:46.430
Ooh, those are lovely ones, aren't they?

11:46.432 --> 11:47.865
I think they're right here. Yes.

11:47.867 --> 11:49.316
For God's sake.

11:49.319 --> 11:51.202
We have a pirate problem.

11:51.204 --> 11:53.638
- Do we?
- No, we do not have a pirate problem.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.840
Our port in the Gulf
has a pirate problem.

11:55.842 --> 11:56.874
It's a loyalty issue.

11:56.876 --> 11:58.509
I suggest you attend to it personally.

11:58.511 --> 11:59.677
Fernando is already there.

11:59.679 --> 12:00.578
Who's Fernando?

12:00.580 --> 12:02.001
My point exactly.

12:02.004 --> 12:04.002
- Nobody.
- He's a loyal enforcer.

12:04.005 --> 12:06.217
But suppose the pirates
make him a better offer.

12:06.219 --> 12:08.619
Ooh, suppose we make
the pirates an offer,

12:08.621 --> 12:10.488
sic them on the competition,
and then split the take?

12:10.490 --> 12:12.189
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.947
That's enough! This is not a democracy.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.227
You two, get out. Alfie, send Fernando.

12:16.229 --> 12:18.162
The rest of you, turn to page three.

12:19.932 --> 12:21.465
Sorry!

12:24.103 --> 12:27.338
Hey. So, that cop who got
killed... Detective Mason.

12:27.340 --> 12:29.373
Did you know he had a
substance-abuse issue?

12:29.375 --> 12:30.608
What?

12:30.610 --> 12:33.044
In 2007, he had a
four-month medical leave,

12:33.046 --> 12:34.712
which turned out to actually be...

12:34.714 --> 12:36.113
A stint in rehab.

12:36.116 --> 12:37.849
He was addicted to painkillers

12:37.852 --> 12:39.684
for an injury he sustained on the job.

12:39.686 --> 12:42.453
But did you know about
the I.A. investigation

12:42.455 --> 12:44.158
into his gambling?

12:44.161 --> 12:46.177
- What are you doing?
- I'm just...

12:46.179 --> 12:48.613
Oh, I asked Sophie to gather
as much information as she could

12:48.615 --> 12:50.882
on Detective Mason, so
we have a context for...

12:50.884 --> 12:52.317
Detective Mason is the victim here.

12:52.319 --> 12:54.252
We're not investigating the victim.

12:54.254 --> 12:56.154
Clearly, Internal Affairs had reason to.

12:56.156 --> 12:58.223
- If he was on drugs...
- He got clean.

12:58.225 --> 12:59.858
Or if he had a gambling addiction,

12:59.860 --> 13:01.826
then maybe there were
other people in his life

13:01.828 --> 13:03.228
that wanted him dead.

13:03.230 --> 13:04.963
What about his dealer or his bookie?

13:04.965 --> 13:06.631
We talked to them. They had alibis.

13:06.633 --> 13:09.934
Ethan had no alibi, except you.

13:10.754 --> 13:12.637
Soph, would you mind
excusing us for a moment?

13:12.639 --> 13:14.072
Sure.

13:17.077 --> 13:18.910
I am not defending Ethan.

13:18.912 --> 13:21.746
I am investigating
possible police corruption,

13:21.748 --> 13:24.215
which is what Nick asked us to do.

13:24.217 --> 13:25.617
Do you want me to stop?

13:27.320 --> 13:28.419
No.

13:28.421 --> 13:30.455
But Steve Mason was a good cop.

13:30.457 --> 13:32.991
He had his demons, but he beat them.

13:32.993 --> 13:36.594
And you of all people should
understand what that's like.

13:38.698 --> 13:39.764
Hey, baby?

13:39.766 --> 13:41.866
Baby, what are you doing?

13:41.868 --> 13:43.701
Oh, we have meetings all day,
and we have that dinner tonight.

13:43.703 --> 13:45.270
No, we don't. I cancelled them.

13:45.272 --> 13:47.639
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

13:47.641 --> 13:50.575
The police are watching us.
My arrest is all over the news.

13:50.577 --> 13:52.210
I know! That's why...

13:52.212 --> 13:55.113
We need to stop and lay
low for a while, okay?

13:55.115 --> 13:57.649
No. That is exactly the
opposite of what we need to do.

13:57.651 --> 13:58.816
If we don't go to those meetings,

13:58.818 --> 14:00.518
if we don't act like
there's nothing wrong,

14:00.520 --> 14:02.555
then our clients are gonna think
that there is something wrong.

14:02.557 --> 14:04.956
They're gonna think that
you killed that cop...

14:04.958 --> 14:07.125
or that you had him killed.

14:11.064 --> 14:14.299
I didn't kill that cop.

14:14.301 --> 14:16.334
And I didn't have him killed, okay?

14:19.218 --> 14:22.219
I told the cops that we left
the club together last night.

14:25.145 --> 14:27.345
Baby...

14:27.347 --> 14:29.213
I love you.

14:29.215 --> 14:31.616
I love you, too.

14:37.424 --> 14:39.357
Then marry me already.

14:43.196 --> 14:44.796
Ward & Vaughan?

14:48.201 --> 14:50.034
Mm...

14:50.036 --> 14:51.369
Ward & Vaughan.

14:54.574 --> 14:56.341
So, tell me about your daughter.

14:56.343 --> 14:58.610
Who is she? What's she like?

14:58.612 --> 15:00.278
I don't even know.

15:00.280 --> 15:01.579
I barely got a chance to talk to her,

15:01.581 --> 15:02.880
and I got to get us out of here soon,

15:02.882 --> 15:04.515
or she's gonna think I'm
staying away on purpose.

15:04.517 --> 15:07.485
Listen, you don't want to go
rushing into this parenthood thing

15:07.487 --> 15:09.087
when your body will be "Dad bod,"

15:09.089 --> 15:11.389
your jeans will be "Dad jeans."

15:11.391 --> 15:12.557
What am I supposed to do?

15:12.559 --> 15:15.393
I owe her 15 years...
An entire childhood.

15:15.395 --> 15:19.230
Well, you saved her 15 years
of Margot as her mother.

15:19.232 --> 15:21.265
- Imagine that.
- I don't have to imagine.

15:21.267 --> 15:22.800
It's happening now.

15:22.802 --> 15:24.268
Does Alice know?

15:24.270 --> 15:25.670
Mm-hmm.

15:25.672 --> 15:27.639
- Justine?
- No, and she can't find out.

15:27.641 --> 15:30.708
We cannot put Margot on the FBI's radar.

15:30.710 --> 15:32.310
She'll hit us back hard.

15:32.312 --> 15:33.687
Did you find anything?

15:33.690 --> 15:35.046
Possibly.

15:35.048 --> 15:37.148
The thief cut the FBI's security cams,

15:37.150 --> 15:39.017
so I combed through the CCTV feeds

15:39.019 --> 15:41.586
within a five-block
radius of the building.

15:41.588 --> 15:44.088
And I'm guessing these are the
guys that broke into the FBI

15:44.090 --> 15:45.757
and stole our information.

15:45.759 --> 15:47.759
What's that tattoo?

15:49.207 --> 15:51.429
A trident... Popular
among Navy S.E.A.L.s.

15:51.431 --> 15:52.764
They're also wearing wing-walkers...

15:52.766 --> 15:53.598
Paratrooper boots.

15:53.601 --> 15:55.266
I'm guessing they were
all Special Forces.

15:55.268 --> 15:57.101
And now?

15:57.103 --> 15:59.270
Possibly Blackwell.

15:59.272 --> 16:01.639
The private military contractors?

16:01.641 --> 16:03.241
We've been investigating
them for months...

16:03.243 --> 16:04.345
Could've been retaliation.

16:04.348 --> 16:05.779
Great. So you know who they are.

16:05.782 --> 16:06.911
- Just go and get them.
- We can't.

16:06.913 --> 16:08.561
We have to obtain evidence, warrants.

16:08.564 --> 16:09.714
It could take weeks.

16:09.716 --> 16:11.215
So, let us go. We don't need warrants.

16:11.217 --> 16:13.284
"Us" as in me and you
against a private army?

16:13.286 --> 16:15.753
Absolutely not. These aren't
other criminals you're conning.

16:15.755 --> 16:18.823
They're mercenaries
responsible for assassinations,

16:18.825 --> 16:20.792
kidnappings, death squads.

16:20.794 --> 16:23.094
Which they will send to
us if we just sit here.

16:23.096 --> 16:24.829
I'm going in and stealing our data back.

16:24.831 --> 16:25.830
You can't!

16:25.832 --> 16:26.964
With these security leaks,

16:26.966 --> 16:29.033
I can't backstop a new I.D. for you.

16:29.035 --> 16:32.103
That's okay. I know someone who can.

16:32.105 --> 16:37.642
Once again, the FBI is no
match for Alice Vaughan.

16:37.644 --> 16:39.290
How can I help?

16:41.414 --> 16:42.857
How's fatherhood treating you?

16:42.860 --> 16:44.741
I'm already a deadbeat dad.

16:44.744 --> 16:45.810
Why is that?

16:45.813 --> 16:48.075
What do you know about
the Blackwell Corp?

16:48.077 --> 16:49.510
Well, I think even they're gonna have

16:49.512 --> 16:51.546
- their hands full with Tessa.
- They're not for Tessa.

16:51.548 --> 16:54.115
They hacked into the FBI,
so I'm gonna need a new I.D.

16:54.117 --> 16:55.817
so I can get in there
and get their data back.

16:55.819 --> 16:57.185
Do you want us to create one for you?

16:57.187 --> 16:59.053
Do you have time? What
are you working on?

16:59.962 --> 17:02.156
A cold case, actually.

17:02.158 --> 17:03.524
So let me know what you need.

17:03.526 --> 17:04.681
You're too good to me.

17:04.684 --> 17:06.993
Did you and Margot

17:06.996 --> 17:09.396
decide what you're
going to do with Tessa?

17:09.398 --> 17:11.699
No. We're still talking about it, but...

17:11.701 --> 17:14.335
Because I think maybe she could
use some professional help.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.471
- Allie...
- She's a killer.

17:16.473 --> 17:17.805
She's mini Margot.

17:17.807 --> 17:19.356
Well, she's also 15.

17:19.358 --> 17:21.476
You remember what you
were like at 15, don't you?

17:21.478 --> 17:23.578
Hormonal, yes. Homicidal, no.

17:23.579 --> 17:24.612
Well, then you're lucky.

17:24.614 --> 17:26.446
I was 13 when I got my first gun.

17:26.449 --> 17:28.783
What? Who gave you a gun at 13?

17:28.785 --> 17:29.984
It doesn't matter.

17:29.986 --> 17:32.386
Point is, I turned out okay... kind of.

17:32.388 --> 17:34.589
Right? Hello?

17:34.591 --> 17:37.191
Uh, shoot me the specs
for your Blackwell I.D.

17:37.193 --> 17:38.926
I got to go. Got it.

17:38.928 --> 17:40.228
Sorry. What's up?

17:40.230 --> 17:41.596
So, remember when I said

17:41.598 --> 17:43.498
we shouldn't investigate the victim?

17:43.500 --> 17:46.400
I did some digging into
Detective Mason's widow.

17:46.402 --> 17:49.546
You did? She left Northridge
the year after the fire.

17:49.549 --> 17:50.982
Now she lives in Bel Air.

17:50.985 --> 17:53.764
And she's paying $80,000 a year

17:53.767 --> 17:55.334
to send the kids to private school.

17:55.337 --> 17:57.345
Is she working? Did she remarry?

17:57.347 --> 17:59.146
She volunteers at the kids' school.

17:59.149 --> 18:00.498
Do you think Ethan paid her off?

18:00.501 --> 18:02.350
I think he's still paying her.

18:02.352 --> 18:05.553
Well, wouldn't be the first
time he bought someone's silence.

18:42.305 --> 18:44.405
You have five seconds
to tell me who you are.

18:44.407 --> 18:46.473
Put the gun away, Ms. Vaughan.

18:46.475 --> 18:47.574
Why would I do that?

18:47.576 --> 18:49.924
Because I'm not the
only one following you.

18:49.927 --> 18:52.246
And the undercover cops across
the plaza won't be nearly

18:52.248 --> 18:54.682
as forgiving about the fact
that you do not possess a license

18:54.684 --> 18:57.084
to carry a firearm in
the state of California.

18:58.743 --> 19:00.788
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know. Let's go this way.

19:02.458 --> 19:03.924
Who are you?

19:03.926 --> 19:06.393
Mr. Ward hired me to...

19:06.395 --> 19:08.329
ensure your safety at all times.

19:08.331 --> 19:09.830
Why didn't he tell me about it,

19:09.832 --> 19:11.465
and where's your gun, bodyguard?

19:14.188 --> 19:15.253
He sent you to spy on me.

19:15.256 --> 19:16.704
He sent me to keep you safe.

19:16.706 --> 19:18.172
Safe from whom?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.275
Your fiancé is a powerful man,

19:21.277 --> 19:24.912
and powerful men
have... powerful enemies.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.814
Including undercover policemen?

19:33.622 --> 19:35.956
He's scared I'm gonna talk to the cops.

19:35.958 --> 19:39.159
I told him he has
nothing to be afraid of.

19:39.161 --> 19:42.229
Do I?

19:42.231 --> 19:44.098
Did Ethan kill that cop?

19:45.901 --> 19:49.036
I was hired to keep an eye on you,

19:49.038 --> 19:50.204
not on him.

19:52.007 --> 19:54.607
Okay.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.443
Let's let him think
you're still doing that.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.479
That way, you get to keep your job.

19:58.481 --> 19:59.880
What are you gonna do?

19:59.882 --> 20:04.151
I'm gonna start paying you
to keep my secrets.

20:09.925 --> 20:11.125
Margot, darling?

20:11.127 --> 20:13.627
Oh, God, does no one in this
family know how to knock?

20:13.629 --> 20:16.163
It's about Fernando.
I am trying to help.

20:16.165 --> 20:18.098
I don't need your help
running the Firm, Mother.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.811
If you want to help
me, help me with Tessa.

20:19.814 --> 20:21.301
Tessa is not the problem at hand.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.236
Maybe not for you.

20:22.238 --> 20:23.704
I keep hoping she'll run away

20:23.706 --> 20:25.706
and go and take over
a country or something.

20:25.708 --> 20:27.207
Give Putin a run for his money.

20:27.209 --> 20:28.542
Did she tell you about Fernando?

20:28.544 --> 20:30.110
This is what I'm talking about.

20:30.112 --> 20:32.379
Come along, Tessa. Your
mother needs her privacy.

20:32.381 --> 20:33.747
You need to go to Mexico.

20:33.749 --> 20:35.840
- Why? What happened?
- Have you not checked your phone?

20:35.842 --> 20:37.851
I was trying to tell you. Fernando.

20:38.788 --> 20:41.221
- Oh, my God!
- They cut off his head.

20:41.223 --> 20:42.890
I'm not telling you what to do...

20:42.892 --> 20:45.004
I'll be on the first
flight to the Gulf tonight.

20:45.007 --> 20:46.738
- I'll come, too.
- No, you'll stay here.

20:46.741 --> 20:48.729
- But...
- I am not taking a 15-year-old girl

20:48.731 --> 20:50.864
into a trade negotiation with pirates.

20:50.866 --> 20:53.367
But I can help you. Pirates
love 15-year-old girls.

20:53.369 --> 20:56.603
You can help me by obeying
your grandmother while I'm away.

20:56.605 --> 20:59.406
You're making a
mistake. I can be of use.

20:59.408 --> 21:01.275
Not this time.

21:01.277 --> 21:02.976
Can you give us a moment, darling?

21:06.115 --> 21:07.848
Be careful.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.686
I did tell you not to send Fernando.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.088
Yeah, but what kind of a
leader takes her mother's advice

21:15.090 --> 21:16.957
- in the middle of a meeting?
- I was trying to...

21:16.959 --> 21:18.725
You were trying to undermine me.

21:18.727 --> 21:20.594
To what end?

21:20.596 --> 21:22.896
My time with the Firm has come and gone.

21:22.898 --> 21:25.566
If your people start
to lose faith in you,

21:25.568 --> 21:27.134
it won't be me they look to.

21:27.136 --> 21:30.270
It'll be her.

21:30.272 --> 21:31.939
- You forgot something.
- Oh!

21:37.346 --> 21:40.547
Come along, naughty girl.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.624
I'm reopening the Mason murder case.

21:47.626 --> 21:48.859
- No, you're not.
- You can't,

21:48.861 --> 21:50.527
not without calling
attention to the fact

21:50.529 --> 21:51.862
you let Ethan walk the first time.

21:51.864 --> 21:54.164
- I didn't let Ethan walk.
- You know what I mean.

21:54.166 --> 21:56.933
Ethan clearly bought off Mason's widow.

21:56.935 --> 21:58.235
We can't prove it.

21:58.237 --> 22:00.237
All we know is she invested
in Ethan's development.

22:00.239 --> 22:02.712
She made $5 million
off her husband's death.

22:02.715 --> 22:03.974
It looks bad, yes.

22:03.976 --> 22:06.443
But it will look even
worse if you reopen a case

22:06.445 --> 22:08.378
based on circumstantial evidence.

22:08.380 --> 22:11.281
Nick, let us find out the truth.

22:11.283 --> 22:13.283
Let us finish what we
started seven years ago.

22:19.992 --> 22:21.925
Why the change of heart, Ms. Vaughan?

22:23.495 --> 22:24.895
Did he threaten you?

22:26.265 --> 22:27.964
No.

22:27.966 --> 22:31.168
Not directly.

22:32.871 --> 22:35.605
He hired somebody to follow me around,

22:35.607 --> 22:38.675
spy on me... A private investigator.

22:38.677 --> 22:41.511
Why would he do that?

22:41.513 --> 22:43.680
To make sure that I don't talk to people

22:43.682 --> 22:46.850
that I shouldn't... Say
things that I shouldn't.

22:46.852 --> 22:49.686
Things like?

22:49.688 --> 22:52.255
I need to know that I'm protected.

22:54.357 --> 22:55.957
Understood.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.260
And for the record, I don't think

22:58.263 --> 22:59.796
that Ethan killed that man.

23:02.834 --> 23:05.135
But he wasn't with me
when I left the club

23:05.137 --> 23:06.970
the night of the fire.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.554
And I'm not gonna lie for a man
who's keeping secrets from me.

23:15.147 --> 23:17.147
What if he killed that cop?

23:17.149 --> 23:20.183
We could find out...

23:22.020 --> 23:23.787
with your help.

23:26.692 --> 23:28.525
You want me to spy on him?

23:28.527 --> 23:30.860
He started it.

23:33.230 --> 23:36.298
If we're going to prove that
Blackwell was behind the FBI breach,

23:36.300 --> 23:41.870
then we need to go after
the woman who ordered it.

23:41.872 --> 23:43.605
Donna Kane, C.E.O.

23:43.607 --> 23:45.140
She founded the company 15 years ago

23:45.142 --> 23:47.403
after a two-and-a-half-decade
stint in the Marines.

23:47.406 --> 23:48.702
I do love a woman in uniform.

23:48.705 --> 23:50.412
Perhaps I could charm her with my...

23:50.414 --> 23:51.513
Hard-core lesbian.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.048
Ah, then no.

23:53.050 --> 23:55.450
- No.
- In that case, I will meet with Ms. Kane

23:55.452 --> 23:56.585
as a prospective client

23:56.587 --> 23:57.986
while you two access
the corporate servers

23:57.988 --> 23:59.087
to steal back those files.

23:59.089 --> 24:00.088
She won't meet with you.

24:00.090 --> 24:01.456
She only meets with major players.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.091
She won't be meeting
with Benjamin Jones.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.460
She'll be meeting with
a wealthy gold baron.

24:05.462 --> 24:06.528
Gold baron?

24:06.530 --> 24:08.196
Thomas Nye. Pleasure to meet you.

24:08.198 --> 24:09.731
AVI already backstopped my cover.

24:09.733 --> 24:11.166
Okay, fine, but a gold baron?

24:11.168 --> 24:13.568
This man just so happens to own

24:13.570 --> 24:17.406
a-a very lucrative network
of mines in Romania.

24:17.408 --> 24:18.774
- The Congo.
- The Congo.

24:18.776 --> 24:20.342
You're assuming she doesn't already know

24:20.344 --> 24:22.377
what you look like based
on the data she stole.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.613
There's only one way to find out.

24:25.716 --> 24:27.048
Welcome to Blackwell.

24:27.050 --> 24:29.050
Ms. Kane's office is right this way.

24:45.836 --> 24:47.202
Mr. Nye, it's a pleasure.

24:47.204 --> 24:48.270
Thank you, Ms. Kane.

24:48.272 --> 24:49.838
This is my associate, Corina Lopez.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.106
Thank you for taking the time.

24:51.108 --> 24:52.941
I have the contract all
ready for you to sign.

24:52.943 --> 24:54.443
Before I sign, we have some concerns.

24:54.445 --> 24:56.912
- Such as?
- Our position in the Congo

24:56.914 --> 24:58.780
is tenuous at the moment.

24:58.782 --> 25:00.882
We need to be assured that your team

25:00.884 --> 25:03.251
has the requisite... firepower?

25:05.556 --> 25:07.022
May I offer you a tour?

25:07.024 --> 25:09.658
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.893
Excuse me. I need to take this.

25:11.895 --> 25:13.307
You go ahead. I'll stay here.

25:13.310 --> 25:14.262
Right this way.

25:14.264 --> 25:15.831
Thank you.

25:33.550 --> 25:35.250
Where am I off to?

25:35.252 --> 25:37.486
31st floor, room 3157.

25:37.488 --> 25:38.787
According to the building layout,

25:38.789 --> 25:40.689
that's the data center
where the server should be.

25:40.691 --> 25:42.123
I'm on my way.

25:47.064 --> 25:48.363
Hold it!

25:48.365 --> 25:50.265
What are you doing up here?

25:50.267 --> 25:52.200
I have a better question, actually.

25:52.202 --> 25:55.270
Have you ever been rendered
unconscious by a federal agent?

25:58.242 --> 26:00.041
First time for everything.

26:02.679 --> 26:04.102
Shall we, my love?

26:07.551 --> 26:09.584
This data center should
have everything we need.

26:09.586 --> 26:11.853
We'll clone the servers, then get out.

26:13.757 --> 26:17.060
Except, this is not a data center.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.497
This is someone's room.

26:22.499 --> 26:23.832
Whoa.

26:27.771 --> 26:29.204
Who the bloody hell are you?

26:29.206 --> 26:32.707
I'm Troy, and you're Special Agent Diaz

26:32.709 --> 26:34.175
in charge of Rhys Spencer Griffiths,

26:34.177 --> 26:35.577
former head of the Kensington Firm.

26:35.579 --> 26:37.512
And now a confidential
informant with Benjamin Jones.

26:37.514 --> 26:38.580
Shut it!

26:38.582 --> 26:40.115
How do you know all this?

26:40.117 --> 26:41.550
He's seen our files.

26:41.552 --> 26:42.884
Where's the information being stored?

26:42.886 --> 26:45.086
- What information?
- About the Bureau's undercovers.

26:45.088 --> 26:47.122
Where are the servers? The hard drives?

26:47.124 --> 26:48.723
You guys don't get it, do you?

26:51.128 --> 26:52.460
I am the hard drive.

26:56.066 --> 26:58.600
Are you here to rescue me?

27:03.798 --> 27:05.767
What do you mean, you're the hard drive?

27:05.770 --> 27:07.517
When Blackwell needs
data copied and stored

27:07.520 --> 27:08.956
but they don't want to leave
an electronic fingerprint,

27:08.958 --> 27:10.057
they send in me.

27:10.059 --> 27:12.059
I look at it once, it's in here forever.

27:12.061 --> 27:13.494
Eidetic memory.

27:13.496 --> 27:15.062
Only a handful of people
in the world have it.

27:15.064 --> 27:17.031
Yeah, and it was a cool job at first.

27:17.033 --> 27:18.365
But when they realized

27:18.367 --> 27:19.700
how valuable the stuff in my head was...

27:19.702 --> 27:20.901
They locked him in a room

27:20.903 --> 27:22.970
with a mini fridge
and cotton-poly sheets.

27:22.972 --> 27:24.743
For my own protection, they said.

27:24.746 --> 27:26.407
They only let him out
under their supervision

27:26.409 --> 27:28.309
to, say, raid the FBI.

27:28.311 --> 27:29.343
How'd you get him out?

27:29.345 --> 27:31.345
Well, I put him in my janitor's onesie.

27:31.347 --> 27:32.940
May I please have some more milk?

27:32.943 --> 27:34.939
Of course you can, darling.
You can have anything you want.

27:34.941 --> 27:36.279
He's so polite!

27:37.537 --> 27:39.019
What are we gonna do with him?

27:39.021 --> 27:40.354
You guys don't have to worry about me.

27:40.356 --> 27:41.655
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

27:41.657 --> 27:43.490
Once Blackwell discovers you're missing,

27:43.492 --> 27:45.359
they're gonna start
looking for you and us.

27:45.361 --> 27:47.161
He can't be here. He
has to go right now.

27:47.163 --> 27:50.564
He can't go. He knows
everything about us.

27:50.566 --> 27:52.466
And he's so pretty.

27:52.468 --> 27:53.834
Thank you.

27:53.836 --> 27:56.437
I don't think we're gonna
have to worry about Blackwell.

27:56.439 --> 27:57.274
Why not?

27:57.277 --> 27:59.340
Because if Troy knows
everything about us,

27:59.342 --> 28:01.108
then he probably knows
everything about Blackwell.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.110
I know a lot.

28:02.113 --> 28:04.445
Enough to shut them down and
put Donna Kane away for good?

28:04.447 --> 28:06.146
How fast can you guys type?

28:08.017 --> 28:09.283
To family.

28:09.285 --> 28:10.884
It's bad luck to toast with water.

28:10.886 --> 28:12.186
May I have some wine?

28:12.188 --> 28:14.855
Oh, there's no such
thing as luck, darling.

28:14.857 --> 28:17.358
Only tactics and timing.

28:17.849 --> 28:21.462
You know, I did try to talk your
mother out of giving you away,

28:21.464 --> 28:25.863
but back then, she was...
well, very much as she is now.

28:25.866 --> 28:28.102
But we mustn't let
that stand in our way.

28:28.104 --> 28:30.337
You're family now.

28:31.785 --> 28:34.475
My dear, a-are you being rude
or just young? I can't tell.

28:34.477 --> 28:36.037
- Sorry.
- Good.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.144
You're a good girl.

28:37.146 --> 28:40.114
Now, is... is there
anything you want to ask me

28:40.116 --> 28:42.983
about the family,
your... your grandfather?

28:44.387 --> 28:46.086
Are there really pirates

28:46.088 --> 28:47.554
attacking our shipments in the Gulf?

28:47.556 --> 28:49.723
Yes, of course there are.

28:50.660 --> 28:51.881
Oh.

28:51.894 --> 28:53.594
Well, I thought, perhaps, it was a ruse

28:53.596 --> 28:56.196
to get rid of mother,
send her off to Mexico,

28:56.198 --> 28:59.592
have whoever cut Fernando's
head off do the same to hers.

29:01.904 --> 29:04.204
Oh, aren't you a quick study?

29:04.206 --> 29:06.306
Photograph of Fernando's
head was a nice touch.

29:06.308 --> 29:07.732
Photoshop.

29:07.735 --> 29:09.702
Mm.

29:09.705 --> 29:11.478
Mind you, they won't kill her.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.414
And after all, she
is my flesh and blood.

29:13.416 --> 29:15.549
But she'll be out of the way,

29:15.551 --> 29:17.685
and I'll retake control of the Firm.

29:17.687 --> 29:20.287
You'll come to London, train by my side,

29:20.289 --> 29:22.189
and assume your birthright.

29:23.793 --> 29:25.926
M-Margot.

29:25.928 --> 29:27.394
You ought to be on a plane.

29:27.396 --> 29:29.145
Why's that, Mother, since apparently

29:29.148 --> 29:30.931
there are no pirates in the Gulf?

29:30.933 --> 29:32.433
She'll be out of the way,

29:32.435 --> 29:34.735
and I'll retake control of the Firm.

29:34.737 --> 29:37.137
You'll come to London, train by my side.

29:37.139 --> 29:39.840
You... You did this together?

29:39.842 --> 29:41.661
You're going away, Mother.

29:41.664 --> 29:45.045
Neither you nor your
help are welcome anymore.

29:45.047 --> 29:47.181
Margot, listen to me.
They won't hurt you.

29:47.183 --> 29:49.583
After all, you are my flesh and blood

29:49.585 --> 29:52.653
and an excellent role model
for how not to raise a daughter.

30:11.107 --> 30:13.774
Well spoke to Mason's widow.

30:13.776 --> 30:15.509
She talked to you? What did she say?

30:15.511 --> 30:16.910
That she's gonna sue us,

30:16.912 --> 30:19.246
and then she sicced
her Rottweiler on me.

30:19.248 --> 30:20.514
Think she's hiding something?

30:20.516 --> 30:21.715
I think I may have found it.

30:21.717 --> 30:23.710
I was going through her
financial statements,

30:23.713 --> 30:25.061
and I noticed that she makes

30:25.064 --> 30:27.521
the same $10,000 charity
payment every month.

30:27.523 --> 30:29.056
It's not a tax write-off?

30:29.058 --> 30:31.525
No, because the charity doesn't exist.

30:31.527 --> 30:33.193
It's called the Altgrove Foundation,

30:33.195 --> 30:35.529
but there's zero online presence.

30:35.531 --> 30:37.057
Well, the money's
going somewhere. May I?

30:37.059 --> 30:38.432
Mm-hmm.

30:38.434 --> 30:41.301
All charities are listed as
a matter of public record,

30:41.303 --> 30:44.772
including the names of who owns them.

30:44.774 --> 30:49.009
- Marty J. Dixon?
- No. Marty Dixon?

30:49.011 --> 30:50.577
Who's Marty Dixon?

30:51.013 --> 30:52.512
The family's here.

30:52.515 --> 30:54.248
My supervising officer.

30:55.851 --> 30:59.586
Captain Marty Dixon is a retired
35-year veteran of the force.

30:59.588 --> 31:01.155
His service record looks clean.

31:01.157 --> 31:04.224
He was a good cop, married
with three kids in Altadena.

31:04.226 --> 31:06.193
Doesn't look like he was living large.

31:06.195 --> 31:07.828
Or that's how he wants it to look.

31:07.830 --> 31:09.530
I got Captain Dixon's bank records.

31:09.532 --> 31:10.631
You've got a money trail?

31:10.633 --> 31:12.766
No, but he did open
a safety-deposit box

31:12.768 --> 31:16.470
at Union Interstate
Bank, September 17, 2009.

31:16.472 --> 31:18.405
That's one week after Mason's murder.

31:18.407 --> 31:20.455
And according to his records,
he hasn't been back there since.

31:20.457 --> 31:22.709
It's been sitting there
untouched for seven years?

31:22.711 --> 31:24.077
It makes you wonder what's inside.

31:24.079 --> 31:25.779
Nick won't have enough for a warrant.

31:25.781 --> 31:29.249
That's okay. We won't need one.

31:29.251 --> 31:30.484
I'll place a call to Dixon

31:30.486 --> 31:32.019
posing as the manager of the bank.

31:32.021 --> 31:33.253
Mr. Dixon?

31:33.255 --> 31:35.689
Hi, Denise Evans here
with Union Interstate.

31:35.691 --> 31:38.625
Unfortunately, I am
tasked with notifying you

31:38.627 --> 31:40.900
that the Mid-Wilshire
branch is closing.

31:40.903 --> 31:44.131
All clients are strongly
urged to gather whatever items

31:44.133 --> 31:47.000
may be stored in the
branch's safety-deposit boxes.

31:47.002 --> 31:48.735
Good to see you, Marty.

31:48.737 --> 31:51.738
Anderson? Uh, this is a surprise.

31:51.740 --> 31:53.440
Do you remember me, Captain?

31:55.277 --> 31:57.077
You want to explain what that is?

31:57.079 --> 31:59.413
This?

31:59.415 --> 32:01.448
This is what kept your boyfriend

32:01.450 --> 32:03.817
from spending the rest
of his life in jail.

32:06.188 --> 32:08.822
Hey, babe? Do you know where my...

32:10.726 --> 32:12.426
No, that won't be necessary.

32:12.428 --> 32:14.428
I'm on my way.

32:15.431 --> 32:17.564
Who was that?

32:17.566 --> 32:21.101
That was Detective Anderson.

32:21.103 --> 32:24.872
She and her partner would like
me to come down to the station,

32:24.874 --> 32:25.939
answer a few questions.

32:25.941 --> 32:28.275
Oh.

32:30.412 --> 32:32.179
What did you tell them?

32:32.181 --> 32:33.380
What?

32:37.325 --> 32:40.226
Babe. Did you tell them
that I killed that cop?

32:40.229 --> 32:41.017
No.

32:41.020 --> 32:42.438
Allie, please.

32:42.441 --> 32:46.059
No, I... Because I don't
know if you killed that cop.

32:46.061 --> 32:47.861
Because I don't know what you
did that night at the fire.

32:47.863 --> 32:49.529
Yes, you do. You were there.

32:49.531 --> 32:50.898
You put me in a cab.

32:50.900 --> 32:52.866
Yeah, because you were wasted.

32:52.868 --> 32:55.068
W-What do you think?

32:55.070 --> 32:56.870
That I went out after
the club that night

32:56.872 --> 32:58.405
and I burned a man alive?

33:01.477 --> 33:03.744
Oh, my God.

33:03.746 --> 33:05.379
I loved you.

33:05.381 --> 33:06.847
- Ethan.
- I was gonna marry you.

33:06.849 --> 33:08.916
- Babe?
- I gave you everything that I had.

33:08.918 --> 33:10.617
- Listen to me.
- I gave you a job.

33:10.619 --> 33:12.352
I gave you a place to live.

33:12.354 --> 33:14.154
- You didn't give me anything.
- Because I believed in you!

33:14.156 --> 33:16.089
- I earned that!
- I actually cared about you!

33:16.091 --> 33:17.591
- I earned all of this!
- You were always thinking

33:17.593 --> 33:19.393
about yourself and protecting yourself.

33:19.395 --> 33:20.961
Yeah, because you sure as
hell weren't gonna protect me.

33:20.963 --> 33:24.231
You hired somebody to spy
on me, to follow me around!

33:24.233 --> 33:26.199
Yes, and I was right to!

33:26.201 --> 33:28.735
Because you're weak and you are selfish,

33:28.737 --> 33:31.471
and you are incapable of thinking

33:31.473 --> 33:35.475
of anything or anyone
other than Alice Vaughan.

33:37.012 --> 33:41.281
And I knew that about
you, the whole time.

33:43.385 --> 33:45.085
And I still loved you.

34:03.282 --> 34:04.404
What's this?

34:04.406 --> 34:06.239
Steve Mason wasn't murdered.

34:06.241 --> 34:08.208
What?

34:08.210 --> 34:09.342
He killed himself.

34:09.344 --> 34:11.311
That's his suicide note.

34:13.382 --> 34:15.148
He was struggling to make ends meet.

34:15.150 --> 34:16.583
He knew his family would collect

34:16.585 --> 34:18.217
if he was killed in the line of duty,

34:18.219 --> 34:19.619
so he set the fire.

34:19.621 --> 34:21.254
How'd you get this?

34:21.255 --> 34:23.623
Through Captain Dixon.

34:23.625 --> 34:27.527
Seven years ago, Mason's
widow showed Dixon the note,

34:27.529 --> 34:29.663
said she should burn
it, but he kept a copy.

34:29.665 --> 34:32.532
And used it to blackmail
her for 10 grand a month.

34:32.534 --> 34:35.018
This note puts you in the clear...

34:35.022 --> 34:36.755
No questions about your record.

34:36.759 --> 34:38.125
And as far as Marty Dixon goes,

34:38.128 --> 34:39.594
it's up to our new Chief of Police

34:39.597 --> 34:41.440
to decide how you want to handle it.

34:42.911 --> 34:45.045
You know what this means?

34:45.047 --> 34:47.748
Ethan Ward was innocent.

34:58.761 --> 35:00.594
What are you doing here?

35:02.931 --> 35:05.565
I owe you an apology.

35:06.702 --> 35:08.201
You don't owe me anything.

35:08.203 --> 35:10.804
Yes, I do.

35:10.806 --> 35:12.773
I owe you everything.

35:12.775 --> 35:15.475
I came to Los Angeles with nothing,

35:15.477 --> 35:18.078
and you changed my life.

35:19.882 --> 35:21.748
And I was wrong.

35:21.750 --> 35:23.884
About what?

35:23.886 --> 35:26.486
I was recently asked
to look into the murder

35:26.488 --> 35:27.988
of Detective Mason.

35:27.990 --> 35:30.457
- Come on, Allie.
- He killed himself.

35:32.394 --> 35:33.794
What?

35:33.796 --> 35:36.897
Mason left his wife a note.

35:36.899 --> 35:40.534
He set the fire so his family could...

35:40.536 --> 35:44.371
Anyway, the point is...

35:44.373 --> 35:47.441
that I'm so sorry.

35:47.443 --> 35:49.509
Beyond.

35:49.511 --> 35:52.245
And I'm not here to
ask you to forgive me.

35:52.247 --> 35:57.150
I'm not here to... ask you for anything.

35:57.152 --> 36:01.121
I just, um, just needed you to know.

36:04.893 --> 36:06.726
Okay.

36:10.966 --> 36:13.266
Okay.

36:28.018 --> 36:30.036
You apologized to Ethan?

36:30.039 --> 36:31.937
What'd he say?

36:31.940 --> 36:37.309
He said, "Okay."

36:37.312 --> 36:38.778
Just "Okay"?

36:40.649 --> 36:42.315
What else could I expect him to say?

36:42.317 --> 36:44.417
I don't know... "Thank you"?

36:44.419 --> 36:45.919
For what, ruining his life?

36:45.921 --> 36:47.382
You did not ruin his life.

36:47.385 --> 36:49.051
You didn't make him a suspect.

36:49.054 --> 36:50.553
He was already under investigation

36:50.556 --> 36:52.456
for fraud, graft...

36:52.459 --> 36:54.459
I know.

36:56.155 --> 36:58.755
Ethan Ward was not a good guy.

37:00.392 --> 37:02.860
I guess.

37:02.862 --> 37:05.262
But neither was I.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.740
When Justine gets off the phone,

37:09.743 --> 37:12.035
tell her to give this to the FBI.

37:12.037 --> 37:14.271
Tell her to give that to the FBI, too.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.904
Where are his clothes?

37:15.907 --> 37:17.808
He was hot.

37:17.810 --> 37:19.209
He is hot. Can we keep him?

37:19.211 --> 37:21.011
It's not enough that I have a child?

37:21.013 --> 37:22.246
You have to have one, too?

37:25.718 --> 37:27.284
- Where's he going?
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.585
You'll wake the baby.

37:28.587 --> 37:31.088
I'm gonna have to wake him
anyway when I arrest him.

37:31.090 --> 37:32.322
Arrest him? For what?

37:32.324 --> 37:34.491
The data in his head
is government property,

37:34.493 --> 37:35.726
which means I'm gonna have to charge him

37:35.728 --> 37:37.327
with theft of classified intel.

37:37.329 --> 37:39.396
You can't charge him. He helped us.

37:39.398 --> 37:42.316
He know who we are. He
knows everything about us.

37:42.319 --> 37:44.063
The feds are gonna
lock him up either way.

37:44.066 --> 37:46.870
Then let me go. Please.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.517
Troy, I... I'll talk to the feds.

37:50.519 --> 37:53.153
We'll work out a deal.
It's going to be fine.

37:53.155 --> 37:55.188
What if I could tell you
where your husband is?

37:55.190 --> 37:56.556
What?

37:56.558 --> 37:58.958
Special Agent Edgar Diaz...

37:58.960 --> 38:00.551
What if I can tell you where he is?

38:00.554 --> 38:03.830
Wait. Your husband is in the FBI?

38:03.832 --> 38:05.398
You know where Eddie is?

38:05.400 --> 38:09.069
I know where he was
before he disappeared...

38:09.071 --> 38:10.765
which is a place to start.

38:12.374 --> 38:13.406
Okay.

38:14.743 --> 38:17.877
Now, help me find my husband...

38:17.879 --> 38:19.279
so I can kill him.

38:21.616 --> 38:24.084
How about...

38:24.086 --> 38:26.219
a family dinner?

38:26.221 --> 38:29.956
Mm. You, me, Tessa, and Margot.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.026
Just you, me, and Tessa.

38:33.028 --> 38:34.394
I can cook.

38:34.396 --> 38:36.229
Babe, she might enjoy
having some time alone

38:36.231 --> 38:39.032
with her dad without
her wicked stepmother.

38:39.034 --> 38:40.199
Have you seen "Cinderella"?

38:40.202 --> 38:42.068
Yeah, that chic was cold.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.703
You are perfect.

38:45.407 --> 38:47.140
I'm really not.

38:48.610 --> 38:49.876
What?

38:49.878 --> 38:52.479
You know that cold case
I've been working on?

38:52.481 --> 38:53.546
Mm-hmm.

38:53.548 --> 38:56.516
It brought up some stuff from my past

38:56.518 --> 38:58.651
that I haven't told you about.

38:58.653 --> 39:00.753
Like what?

39:02.390 --> 39:07.760
Before I met you, before
AVI, I was... different.

39:07.762 --> 39:08.658
Allie, you don't...

39:08.661 --> 39:10.363
I need to tell you
this so you don't think

39:10.365 --> 39:11.764
I'm hiding anything from you.

39:13.337 --> 39:16.068
There was a man in my
life before I met you.

39:16.071 --> 39:17.270
Ethan Ward.

39:19.074 --> 39:21.741
How do you know about Ethan?

39:21.743 --> 39:24.377
I know everything about you.

39:25.647 --> 39:26.846
I thought you understood.

39:26.848 --> 39:28.248
Margot and I, we researched you

39:28.250 --> 39:30.950
and your life very carefully.

39:33.555 --> 39:34.887
When you were targeting me.

39:34.890 --> 39:37.090
Yes.

39:37.092 --> 39:39.993
When you were creating Christopher Hall.

39:39.995 --> 39:43.329
He was based on Ethan...

39:43.331 --> 39:45.665
The best parts of Ethan.

39:52.874 --> 39:54.707
You profiled me.

39:54.709 --> 39:56.576
None of this is really new information.

39:56.578 --> 39:59.179
You saw that I had a type,
and then you became that type.

39:59.181 --> 40:00.547
I was just doing my job.

40:00.549 --> 40:02.949
I know. I know that.

40:02.951 --> 40:05.952
I'm different now. So are you.

40:08.924 --> 40:10.957
It's gonna be fine.

40:10.959 --> 40:12.635
We're gonna be fine.

40:12.638 --> 40:14.327
But I don't think that I can, um...

40:14.329 --> 40:17.096
What can I do?

40:17.098 --> 40:18.213
Just tell me what to do.

40:31.913 --> 40:33.980
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:38.053 --> 40:39.285
Can we talk?
