02:10.193 --> 02:12.388
I just missed your heart.

02:41.123 --> 02:42.488
You're dead.

02:42.725 --> 02:44.090
Right now.

02:44.827 --> 02:46.419
I've killed you.

02:58.574 --> 03:00.235
Use your hands!

03:17.493 --> 03:19.825
Drag that deer back yourself.

04:25.428 --> 04:26.759
What's wrong?

04:27.396 --> 04:28.727
Are you hurt?

04:29.398 --> 04:30.990
You were half asleep.

04:31.534 --> 04:33.263
You must always be ready.

04:33.903 --> 04:35.530
Even when you're sleeping.

04:36.105 --> 04:37.697
Think on your feet.

04:37.807 --> 04:38.831
Adapt...

04:38.908 --> 04:40.967
Or die.
I'll do better next time.

04:41.877 --> 04:43.401
German.

04:46.215 --> 04:47.842
Italian.

04:52.254 --> 04:53.687
Spanish.

05:03.933 --> 05:05.798
How much did you
pull off the deer?

05:06.902 --> 05:08.927
120 with scraps.

05:09.405 --> 05:11.305
200 pounds in total.

05:11.807 --> 05:13.138
I think so.

05:13.609 --> 05:15.099
That explains it.

05:16.545 --> 05:17.569
What?

05:17.880 --> 05:19.404
How you beat me.

05:20.449 --> 05:22.110
You're getting strong.

05:34.597 --> 05:38.465
"The great blue whale is the
largest animal to have ever existed.

05:39.001 --> 05:41.333
"Its heart weighs
1300 pounds,

05:48.010 --> 05:51.844
"The blue whale's music can
be heard for over 500 miles.

05:52.314 --> 05:54.612
"A blue whale's tongue weighs
over two and a half tons."

05:54.684 --> 05:56.345
What does music feel like?

06:02.091 --> 06:04.855
"Music.
A combination of sounds,

06:05.027 --> 06:09.191
"with a view to beauty of form
and expression of emotion."

06:10.666 --> 06:12.793
I want to hear it
for myself.

06:13.035 --> 06:15.060
We have all we need
right here.

06:15.504 --> 06:17.062
It's not enough.

06:21.343 --> 06:22.810
I'm ready.

06:23.979 --> 06:26.106
Papa, I'm ready.

07:39.355 --> 07:41.721
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

07:41.791 --> 07:45.056
One, two, three, four,
five, six. One, two...

07:45.127 --> 07:47.118
<i>I live in Leipzig.
German city.</i>

08:19.061 --> 08:21.052
I also have a dog
called Trudi.

08:56.098 --> 08:57.463
I'm ready.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.327
I'm ready now.

09:09.478 --> 09:13.278
...26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

09:18.487 --> 09:19.784
37.

10:06.268 --> 10:09.260
Did you see it? Did you
hear it? It's like thunder.

10:09.338 --> 10:10.805
It was so beautiful.

10:17.313 --> 10:18.405
What is it?

10:18.747 --> 10:21.215
It tells Marissa Wiegler
where we are.

10:23.686 --> 10:26.086
If you think you're ready
and you want to leave here,

10:26.288 --> 10:28.654
all you have to do
is flip that switch.

10:32.761 --> 10:35.127
But once it's done,
there's no going back.

10:36.365 --> 10:38.629
She won't stop
until you're dead.

10:39.401 --> 10:42.234
Or she is. You understand?

10:44.440 --> 10:46.465
I won't be there
to hold your hand.

10:48.811 --> 10:50.438
So be sure.

10:51.981 --> 10:54.245
Be sure it's what
you really want.

10:58.821 --> 10:59.981
It's here.

11:00.622 --> 11:02.317
There's no rush.

11:12.067 --> 11:15.764
<i>"Laika, a mongrel dog

11:15.971 --> 11:19.168

11:19.742 --> 11:21.539
<i>"She was launched

11:45.701 --> 11:47.362
But she didn't, did she?

11:47.703 --> 11:49.898
They couldn't bring
the rocket back, remember?

11:50.873 --> 11:52.363
I remember.

11:52.841 --> 11:55.969
But sometimes I wish you
would read it differently.

12:02.451 --> 12:03.918
"When a star collapses,

12:04.053 --> 12:06.647

"brighter than

12:41.390 --> 12:43.153
Will you hunt with me?

12:44.593 --> 12:46.151
If you want.

12:46.829 --> 12:48.421
It's up to you.

12:49.832 --> 12:50.890
Me?

12:51.600 --> 12:52.828
Yes.

12:56.405 --> 12:57.895
I'll stay.

13:04.012 --> 13:05.536
Yes. Good.

13:39.848 --> 13:41.713
Marissa Wiegler.

13:47.422 --> 13:49.720
Come and find me.

14:09.344 --> 14:11.175
You were lucky
you caught that deer.

14:11.780 --> 14:14.010
There was nothing
out there today.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.786
It smells good.

14:26.028 --> 14:27.188
When will it be ready?

14:28.931 --> 14:30.296
Soon.

15:22.751 --> 15:24.981
We picked up an
unencrypted signal. One of ours.

15:25.053 --> 15:26.611
- When?
- 0632 Eastern Standard.

15:26.688 --> 15:30.021
Triangulated about 60 miles below
the Arctic Circle. Near Kuusamo.

15:30.259 --> 15:31.317
We think it's Erik Heller.

15:31.393 --> 15:32.382
Erik Heller?

15:32.461 --> 15:33.655
You were
his handler, right?

15:33.729 --> 15:34.855
Sure. Name sounds familiar.

15:44.139 --> 15:45.629
Fuck, Erik.

15:46.508 --> 15:47.975
Why now?

15:57.686 --> 15:59.483
How does it look?

15:59.655 --> 16:00.986
Good.

16:05.527 --> 16:06.619
Almost good.

16:06.762 --> 16:09.026
<i>Erik Heller.
Recruited in 1991.</i>

16:09.231 --> 16:10.664
<i>Former FSK operative.</i>

16:10.732 --> 16:12.825
<i>He became integral to our
counterintelligence ops</i>

16:12.901 --> 16:14.698
<i>in Eastern Europe
and Central Asia.</i>

16:15.003 --> 16:17.403
His file ends in '94.

16:17.472 --> 16:20.305
And there was no sign of
life until April 18th, 1996

16:20.375 --> 16:23.276
when his fingerprints were
found on a.22 caliber Luger

16:23.345 --> 16:25.905
found beside the body
of one Johanna Zadeck.

16:26.148 --> 16:29.140
Johanna Zadeck.
Born 1970. German.

16:29.318 --> 16:32.651
She was spotted and developed by
Heller in 1994. Never recruited.

16:32.721 --> 16:34.086
Why was she being developed?

16:34.156 --> 16:35.714
That's not in the file.
Let's keep on task.

16:36.091 --> 16:39.083
Heller is a rogue asset. I
propose we go in and pull him out.

16:39.361 --> 16:42.262
We've got bigger problems,
Marissa. Let Interpol pick him up.

16:42.331 --> 16:43.662
He's no longer
our responsibility.

16:43.865 --> 16:47.323
Interpol nabs him, then
exposes him to BND, FSB, France.

16:47.402 --> 16:49.393
Do you really want
every intelligence agency

16:49.471 --> 16:51.166
in Europe scratching
at this thread?

16:51.506 --> 16:52.598
- Lewis?
- I'm sorry,

16:52.674 --> 16:54.642
but we need to keep this
contained, gentlemen.

16:54.743 --> 16:56.608
Keep it small.
I worked with this man.

16:56.745 --> 16:58.508
He knows things I don't
think you wanna know.

16:58.580 --> 16:59.979
I appreciate
your candor.

17:00.048 --> 17:01.106
What do
you need, Lewis?

17:01.183 --> 17:03.310
<i>One man, one day operation.</i>

17:11.126 --> 17:12.957
- Tell me again. Then?
- Marissa Wiegler.

17:13.028 --> 17:14.325
- Postcard.
- Then?

17:14.396 --> 17:15.385
What?

17:15.464 --> 17:16.453
The address where we meet.

17:16.531 --> 17:19.625
Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse
260. 10559 Berlin, Germany.

17:19.701 --> 17:20.690
What else?

17:20.769 --> 17:21.861
Adapt or die.

17:21.936 --> 17:22.961
Think on your feet.

17:23.038 --> 17:24.130
Even when I'm sleeping.

17:27.809 --> 17:29.276
Papa...

17:29.478 --> 17:31.309
Remember what I taught you.
You'll be fine.

17:32.547 --> 17:34.071
I'll see you there.

18:38.780 --> 18:41.840
Entry 1, copy.
I'm on target. 5 right.

18:44.119 --> 18:45.347
Sky Guard.

18:46.321 --> 18:47.515
Flank 1, clear.

18:47.722 --> 18:49.212
Watch your step.

18:49.291 --> 18:50.383
He knows we're coming.

18:50.992 --> 18:52.755
Entry 1, copy.
Downrange, you're clear.

18:53.128 --> 18:55.119
- Alpha moving.
- Move!

19:18.987 --> 19:20.147
McCullum, do you read me?

19:20.288 --> 19:21.721
Sky Guard, over.

19:24.359 --> 19:27.226
<i>McCullum? I repeat,
McCullum, do you read me?</i>

19:29.030 --> 19:31.157
Go, go, go! Go, Bravo, go!

19:38.173 --> 19:41.700
We got men down! We
need help! We need a medic!

19:41.776 --> 19:43.368
Secure the area!

19:50.118 --> 19:51.517
<i>Erik Heller escaped.</i>

19:51.720 --> 19:52.812
How did that happen?

19:52.888 --> 19:55.186
<i>Unclear. We think he got away
in the snowstorm or...</i>

19:55.257 --> 19:57.020
<i>But he's in the wind,
and I've got 2 men down.</i>

19:57.225 --> 19:59.090
<i>- "One man, one day operation."

19:59.160 --> 20:00.320
<i>- Just find him, Lewis.
- Poor visibility,</i>

20:00.395 --> 20:02.158
<i>...he knows the land, shit intel.
- Find him and bring him to me.</i>

20:02.230 --> 20:05.631
<i>There was a kid.
Things got out of our control.</i>

20:06.735 --> 20:07.724
<i>Wiegler?</i>

20:09.404 --> 20:10.928
<i>Wiegler, are you there?</i>

20:11.072 --> 20:12.061
Where is she now?

20:17.379 --> 20:18.710
Hello, Hanna.

20:19.714 --> 20:20.806
Hello.

20:21.049 --> 20:24.712
My name's Dr. Burton. Would
you like to talk to me?

20:26.054 --> 20:29.046
I was told by my father
to gain the upper hand.

20:29.257 --> 20:31.248
That's very interesting.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.753
What else did
your father tell you?

20:35.497 --> 20:36.930
Where am I?

20:37.132 --> 20:38.656
You're in holding.

20:39.467 --> 20:41.765
I've never been
in a room like this.

20:41.970 --> 20:44.404
It must all be
very strange for you.

20:44.472 --> 20:46.997
How long have you
been in the forest?

20:52.147 --> 20:53.409
Hanna?

20:59.821 --> 21:00.981
Are those cameras?

21:01.056 --> 21:02.114
Uh-huh.

21:02.857 --> 21:04.848
They're taking our
picture right now.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.593
To keep a record.

21:06.761 --> 21:08.422
How does that make you feel?

21:09.064 --> 21:10.497
Camera obscura.

21:11.533 --> 21:12.932
It's Latin for
"dark chamber."

21:14.135 --> 21:18.902
<i>It was first described by the Arabic
scientist Ibn Alhazen in the year 1021.</i>

21:19.474 --> 21:21.942
Plug the CCTV
through to Langley.

21:24.145 --> 21:26.010
<i>Yeah, you should have visual
on the psych evaluation now.</i>

21:26.081 --> 21:27.241
<i>Can I get you something?</i>

21:27.549 --> 21:30.177
<i>What do you like?
Music? Magazines?</i>

21:30.719 --> 21:33.153
Just ask. Anything at all.

21:34.823 --> 21:36.814
I want to speak
to Marissa Wiegler.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.154
Tell her
I'll be there tonight.

21:40.295 --> 21:41.353
I can handle this.

21:41.496 --> 21:43.430
Just do what you're told.

21:48.903 --> 21:51.633
John, take a look at
this kid's blood sample.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.264
Is that right?

21:53.341 --> 21:55.275
- Is it?
- Can't be right.

21:55.343 --> 21:57.174
I got a sample of her hair.

21:57.512 --> 21:58.877
Must be contaminated.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.411
Run it again.

22:27.175 --> 22:29.405
My name
is Marissa Wiegler.

22:30.912 --> 22:33.005
You wanted to
speak with me?

22:40.755 --> 22:42.518
You can wait outside.

22:48.863 --> 22:50.194
Where am I?

22:50.532 --> 22:52.864
You're in
a safe place, sweetie.

22:55.103 --> 22:57.196
Where did you
meet my father?

22:58.406 --> 22:59.395
Erik.

23:00.041 --> 23:01.235
You mean Erik?

23:03.812 --> 23:04.870
Yes.

23:05.346 --> 23:09.112
I met him by a news kiosk in
Alexanderplatz, East Berlin.

23:10.051 --> 23:12.178
I met him at a news kiosk.

23:13.221 --> 23:14.745
Alexanderplatz.

23:14.956 --> 23:15.945
<i>Say it was raining.</i>

23:16.024 --> 23:17.013
In the rain.

23:17.659 --> 23:19.593
<i>He had just
arrived from Prague.</i>

23:19.961 --> 23:21.792
Just arrived from Prague.

23:21.963 --> 23:24.523
He had just
arrived from Prague.

23:31.239 --> 23:33.002
Do you know
where your father is?

23:34.609 --> 23:36.736
Did he tell you
where he was going?

23:38.146 --> 23:40.410
<i>We're all worried
about him.</i>

23:43.017 --> 23:44.678
It's okay.

23:46.955 --> 23:48.422
Agent, keep your distance.

23:49.124 --> 23:50.455
It's okay.

23:51.860 --> 23:53.191
It's okay.

23:55.196 --> 23:56.629
<i>You want me
to give her something?</i>

23:57.098 --> 23:58.725
I think that
might be necessary.

24:00.702 --> 24:01.726
Abort.

24:04.873 --> 24:06.101
Open up.

24:06.307 --> 24:08.138
I repeat, Agent, abort.

24:26.027 --> 24:27.961
Oh, my!

24:32.233 --> 24:33.325
<i>Wiegler!</i>

24:40.208 --> 24:41.300
<i>Wiegler!</i>

24:58.393 --> 25:00.258
Target is in sector 3.

25:00.495 --> 25:02.292
Shut it down! Shut it down!

26:19.440 --> 26:21.237
Lord, help me.

27:32.413 --> 27:35.473
- You think she got out?
- She can't get out!

27:38.219 --> 27:39.584
<i>Who's on the perimeter?</i>

27:40.088 --> 27:42.989
<i>Detail every unit available.</i>

30:52.113 --> 30:53.102
<i>Mama!</i>

32:46.427 --> 32:49.089
She will never be yours.

33:07.648 --> 33:10.310
<i>She will never be yours.</i>

33:48.856 --> 33:50.050
Hey.

33:50.257 --> 33:51.588
Hello?

33:51.892 --> 33:53.154
Don't you speak English?

33:54.762 --> 33:56.559
It's not your fault
if you can't.

33:56.897 --> 33:59.161
MIA couldn't speak English
until she was 8

33:59.567 --> 34:02.536
because she was, like, a refugee
or something from Sri Lanka.

34:02.703 --> 34:04.967
And now she's a pop star.
In America, too.

34:05.206 --> 34:07.265
So don't worry if you
can't speak English yet.

34:07.341 --> 34:08.399
Who's she?

34:08.542 --> 34:12.000
I found her. She can't speak
English. She's from Sri Lanka.

34:12.079 --> 34:13.808
I'm from Germany.

34:14.782 --> 34:15.771
Oh.

34:16.583 --> 34:19.643
I live in Leipzig. Population
0.7 million peoples.

34:19.786 --> 34:21.652
We live at number
7 Weissingerplatz.

34:21.722 --> 34:24.748
I like literature and sport, in
particular tennis and athletics.

34:24.824 --> 34:26.985
I go to school at
the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium,

34:27.061 --> 34:29.427
and my best friends are Rudi
Gunther and Clara Schliess.

34:30.130 --> 34:31.223
They sound fun.

34:31.866 --> 34:33.356
I also have
a dog called Trudi.

34:33.434 --> 34:34.900
We had a dog
called Vincent.

34:35.101 --> 34:36.763
But he went mad and died.

34:44.978 --> 34:46.172
Sophie!

34:46.480 --> 34:47.913
Sophie!

34:48.114 --> 34:49.446
See you.

34:49.650 --> 34:51.811
Sophie! Come on!

35:07.368 --> 35:09.393
I'm Sophie, and that's
my brother, Miles.

35:10.471 --> 35:12.336
I'm Hanna.

35:13.007 --> 35:15.032
Do you need
a lift somewhere?

35:16.210 --> 35:18.678
No. I prefer to walk.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.270
Suit yourself.

35:25.453 --> 35:28.286
Sophie, come on.
We're all waiting for you.

35:30.724 --> 35:32.988
<i>Tactical says she's in the desert
southeast of Essaouira.</i>

35:33.060 --> 35:34.288
Focus all operations
on Heller.

35:34.829 --> 35:36.797
<i>Are you saying
the girl is not of interest to us?</i>

35:36.864 --> 35:38.126
<i>Yes, of course,
she's of interest, Lewis,</i>

35:38.199 --> 35:40.167
<i>but not an immediate
threat to the security</i>

35:40.234 --> 35:42.168
<i>of the United
States of America.</i>

35:42.236 --> 35:45.569
Erik Heller is the immediate
threat. Focus on Heller.

38:04.678 --> 38:05.702
Where is your family?

38:05.779 --> 38:06.768
Are you Arab?

38:07.214 --> 38:08.875
I'm Moroccan.

38:09.350 --> 38:10.783
Morocco.

38:10.985 --> 38:14.819
Capital city: Rabat. Places of
interest: Marrakech, Essaouira.

38:15.022 --> 38:16.990
Religion: Islam.
Language: Arabic.

41:31.652 --> 41:32.710
It's the German girl!

41:32.920 --> 41:34.285
Is "Kraut" an ethnic slur?

41:35.055 --> 41:36.522
Like "queer" or "lesbo"?

41:36.723 --> 41:38.418
I think I'd quite
like to be a lesbian.

41:38.659 --> 41:39.921
But not one
of those fat ones.

41:39.993 --> 41:41.688
One who's, like,
a supermodel.

41:41.762 --> 41:44.890
But we'd only hold hands, and I
think I'd probably marry a man.

41:45.399 --> 41:46.696
What?

42:31.979 --> 42:33.003
No kiss?

42:33.080 --> 42:35.605
She's a bit old
for you, isn't she?

42:35.816 --> 42:38.250
She has male and
female genitalias.

42:38.452 --> 42:40.886
And you love her
just the way she is.

42:41.154 --> 42:42.644
I like to give people
what they want.

42:47.327 --> 42:49.022
I'll save it
for when I need it.

42:50.797 --> 42:51.991
What do you want, Marissa?

42:52.900 --> 42:54.731
Erik Heller is still alive.

42:54.935 --> 42:56.402
Of course.

42:56.536 --> 42:57.525
And the girl.

42:58.405 --> 42:59.394
Ah.

43:00.607 --> 43:02.939
Why are you here?
Be concise.

43:03.143 --> 43:04.508
I need you.

43:04.778 --> 43:08.214
You need me? Little old
me? I'm very flattered.

43:08.282 --> 43:10.807
I need your
talents, darling.

43:11.018 --> 43:14.078
I need you to do things
my agency will not let me do.

43:25.098 --> 43:28.090
The devil is in
the details, isn't he?

43:31.171 --> 43:32.604
It's the girl or Erik?

43:32.773 --> 43:35.139
She's in Morocco.
It's all in the envelope.

43:35.208 --> 43:36.732
Let me worry about Erik.

43:38.178 --> 43:39.770
Shall I kill her?

43:40.948 --> 43:42.313
Just find her.

43:45.585 --> 43:46.574
Marissa.

43:49.323 --> 43:51.188
Did she turn out
as you hoped?

43:53.193 --> 43:54.524
Better.

44:03.370 --> 44:05.930
She was married to this footballer
and gave him lots of advice

44:06.006 --> 44:08.634
about how to spend his money
and do his tax.

44:08.709 --> 44:10.040
'Cause even though
she's beautiful,

44:10.110 --> 44:11.407
she's actually
brilliant with money.

44:11.478 --> 44:13.605
Get off! Like,
for their anniversary,

44:13.680 --> 44:15.409
he said,
"Here's 15 grand

44:15.482 --> 44:17.177
"toward a Hermes Kelly bag
or a boob job."

44:17.250 --> 44:19.343
Now, she said she knew
the boob implants

44:19.419 --> 44:21.478
would have to be replaced
every 10 years,

44:21.555 --> 44:24.080
but that the Hermes Kelly bag
never depreciates in value.

44:24.157 --> 44:26.250
- That's enough with the boob jobs.
- That's just common sense.

44:26.326 --> 44:27.759
That's why
everybody loves her.

44:28.595 --> 44:29.892
Mum is against
plastic surgery.

44:29.963 --> 44:30.952
I am.

44:31.031 --> 44:32.623
Mum doesn't even
wear makeup.

44:32.699 --> 44:34.860
I don't.
I think it's dishonest.

44:35.035 --> 44:36.627
This is my face.
Take it or leave it.

44:37.104 --> 44:39.629
If you study history of art or anthropology...

44:39.706 --> 44:41.105
Rachel got her
first at Cambridge.

44:41.174 --> 44:43.074
...you learn that red
lipstick mimics arousal

44:43.143 --> 44:44.804
and suggests the geography
of the labia minora.

44:44.878 --> 44:45.867
Puke!

44:45.946 --> 44:47.743
Whereas, I have a lot of
natural red pigment in my lips

44:47.814 --> 44:48.906
so I really don't need it.

44:48.982 --> 44:50.108
- Vomitorium!
- Soph...

44:50.183 --> 44:52.014
- It's embarrassing!
- Just grow up, all right?

44:52.085 --> 44:53.074
- Grow up?
- Yeah.

44:53.153 --> 44:54.381
Oh, because yesterday
Mum was saying

44:54.454 --> 44:55.614
I shouldn't act
beyond my years.

44:55.689 --> 44:57.554
It does leave her with
mixed messages, darling.

44:57.624 --> 45:00.058
Because we're trying to communicate
to her how to enjoy childhood.

45:00.127 --> 45:02.618
I just want her to stop
saying "vomitorium." All right?

45:02.729 --> 45:04.253
Oy, it's not funny.

45:09.770 --> 45:11.795
So, Hanna... Hanna?

45:12.072 --> 45:14.063
I'm quite impressed about you
traveling around on your own.

45:15.108 --> 45:16.973
My father encourages me
to be independent.

45:17.544 --> 45:18.806
You see,
that's wonderful.

45:18.879 --> 45:20.744
- I was backpacking at your age.
- Where is he? Your father?

45:20.814 --> 45:24.306
I spent a heavenly summer just
island hopping around Greece...

45:24.384 --> 45:26.614
Bed hopping around Greece.

45:27.154 --> 45:29.418
What? No, it's valuable.

45:29.489 --> 45:32.287
Our experience makes us who
we are. Isn't that right, kids?

45:34.561 --> 45:37.553
So, Hanna, is your mum
and dad still together?

45:38.231 --> 45:39.721
My mother is dead.

45:40.200 --> 45:41.394
Nice one, Dad.

45:41.635 --> 45:44.866
I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my
mum when I was very young. So...

45:45.072 --> 45:48.303
It's all right.
It happened a long time ago.

45:48.475 --> 45:49.999
Hanna,

45:50.210 --> 45:52.371
what did your mum die of?

45:52.612 --> 45:53.601
Three bullets.

45:54.815 --> 45:56.908
Oh, my God,
that's appalling.

46:06.726 --> 46:09.024
"A combination of sounds,

46:09.229 --> 46:11.823
"with a view
to beauty of form

46:13.100 --> 46:15.330
"and expression of emotion."

46:24.411 --> 46:25.810
"Abnormal."

46:36.189 --> 46:37.850
What happens
if it rains?

46:37.924 --> 46:39.323
Well, you're
gonna get wet, aren't you?

46:39.392 --> 46:41.053
Because someone
broke the sunroof

46:41.128 --> 46:42.254
and seeing as me
and your mother are...

46:42.329 --> 46:43.387
"Your mother and I."

46:43.463 --> 46:44.987
Seeing as me and your mother,
your mother and I,

46:45.065 --> 46:46.896
are responsible adults,
it leaves you two.

46:46.967 --> 46:49.868
My fungal nail
infection's back.

46:49.936 --> 46:51.801
Is there gonna be a
swimming pool where we're going?

46:51.872 --> 46:53.737
- Yeah, there'll be a swimming pool.
- Yes!

46:53.807 --> 46:55.536
- Yes, there will be.
- Have you packed up the bags?

46:55.609 --> 46:57.372
I don't
understand why VIP means

46:57.444 --> 46:59.309
after the illegal
immigrants and the goats.

47:40.987 --> 47:42.978
Brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

47:43.190 --> 47:46.421
Let's play "shut up"
for 20 seconds, everyone.

49:15.882 --> 49:16.871
Yeah!

49:25.692 --> 49:27.319
Go, go, go!

49:39.306 --> 49:40.295
Shh.

49:53.953 --> 49:55.011
I've contacted Interpol.

49:55.088 --> 49:56.112
On whose authority?

49:56.189 --> 49:58.555
Walt. We can't keep this
to ourselves anymore.

49:58.758 --> 49:59.986
Were you not listening?

50:00.060 --> 50:01.652
He killed 2 policemen.

50:01.861 --> 50:04.625
He's reframed the situation.
It is out of our control.

50:04.698 --> 50:07.292
Then we must
regain control, Mr. Lewis.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.695
I am the first
and the last person

50:09.769 --> 50:11.896
Erik Heller will see.
Are we clear?

50:14.741 --> 50:17.335
Are we clear, Mr. Lewis?

50:17.410 --> 50:18.399
Yes, ma'am.

52:19.132 --> 52:21.259
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

52:23.102 --> 52:25.730
The sunroof. Was it you?

52:26.005 --> 52:27.233
Would it be
very bad if it was?

52:27.307 --> 52:30.071
You mean, you were in
the van the whole time?

52:30.877 --> 52:32.742
My dad would have a heart
attack if he found out.

52:33.079 --> 52:34.706
Will you have to tell him?

52:34.781 --> 52:36.339
Hanna! You are so mental.

52:36.549 --> 52:38.449
Of course, I'm not
going to tell him.

52:38.585 --> 52:39.609
I think it's brilliant.

52:40.453 --> 52:42.080
Have you got
anywhere to stay?

52:42.288 --> 52:43.312
No.

52:43.389 --> 52:44.913
Yes, you do.
You're staying with me.

52:44.991 --> 52:46.015
I am?

52:46.192 --> 52:47.352
Yeah, obviously.

52:47.460 --> 52:49.257
I'm sneaking you in
on one condition.

52:49.729 --> 52:50.753
What?

52:50.897 --> 52:52.194
These boys.

52:52.398 --> 52:53.865
Spanish.

52:53.967 --> 52:55.059
Gorgeous.

52:56.236 --> 52:57.396
No, don't look.

52:57.470 --> 52:59.700
They're not all preeny
about it like footballers.

52:59.772 --> 53:02.570
Haven't got their
eyebrows waxed or anything.

53:02.942 --> 53:03.966
Good.

53:04.043 --> 53:06.637
Anyway, I'm meeting them
tonight, and you have to come.

53:06.713 --> 53:07.737
All right.

53:07.814 --> 53:09.338
God, you're not
hard to convince. Ho.

53:09.816 --> 53:10.874
Ho?

53:12.619 --> 53:13.779
Got anything to wear?

53:15.488 --> 53:18.286
You can't wear those. You
look like some mad German.

53:28.167 --> 53:29.464
Are you scared?

53:29.669 --> 53:31.136
Of what?

56:21.774 --> 56:24.004
Are we going to kiss now?

56:27.080 --> 56:28.741
Would you like to?

56:33.119 --> 56:37.021
Kissing requires a total
of 34 facial muscles

56:37.256 --> 56:40.020
and 112 postural muscles.

56:41.494 --> 56:45.055
The most important muscle involved
is the orbicularis oris muscle

56:45.531 --> 56:48.762
because it is used
to pucker the lips.

57:06.452 --> 57:07.885
Hanna, you mentalist!

57:08.121 --> 57:11.249
Please, tell your friend
I just wanted a kiss.

57:11.858 --> 57:13.189
Hanna!

57:13.626 --> 57:14.650
Should I let him go?

57:14.727 --> 57:18.322
As opposed to what?
Yes, you should let him go!

57:22.468 --> 57:24.402
I'm going to go now.

57:25.071 --> 57:26.402
Okay.

57:27.473 --> 57:28.963
It was nice.

58:04.577 --> 58:06.545
Sophie? Is that you?

58:29.368 --> 58:32.701
Oh, my God, they're at it like
rabbits. That's so embarrassing.

58:32.772 --> 58:33.761
At what?

58:33.840 --> 58:35.535
I can't believe you.

58:50.990 --> 58:52.685
<i>Hello, Mama.</i>

58:52.959 --> 58:56.019
<i>I know you're disappointed
in me. I know it.</i>

58:57.163 --> 58:59.097
<i>I'm so sorry, Mama.</i>

58:59.298 --> 59:00.424
<i>But...</i>

59:00.800 --> 59:03.496
<i>But maybe
I have found a way to make it better.</i>

59:04.437 --> 59:06.598
<i>I'm in a program now,</i>

59:06.806 --> 59:09.434
<i>a program to make
babies stronger.</i>

59:10.109 --> 59:12.805
<i>It's an American program.
Very scientific...</i>

01:00:44.603 --> 01:00:46.093
Hanna.

01:01:00.119 --> 01:01:01.450
Hanna?

01:01:01.887 --> 01:01:02.945
Yes?

01:01:03.055 --> 01:01:05.046
Where do you
really come from?

01:01:06.292 --> 01:01:07.725
Leipzig.

01:01:07.994 --> 01:01:09.291
I live in Leipzig.

01:01:09.495 --> 01:01:12.225
If we're going to be friends, you're
going to have to be honest with me.

01:01:12.298 --> 01:01:13.856
Them's the rules.

01:01:15.534 --> 01:01:16.523
Are we friends?

01:01:17.003 --> 01:01:19.437
Yes. I like you.

01:01:22.141 --> 01:01:24.166
I'd like to have a friend.

01:01:24.677 --> 01:01:27.612
I mean, you're a freak and
everything, but I like you.

01:01:28.914 --> 01:01:30.176
I like you, too.

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:32.918
I really do,

01:01:34.253 --> 01:01:36.585
but there are things
I can't tell you.

01:01:37.089 --> 01:01:38.579
Do you understand?

01:01:38.791 --> 01:01:40.122
Yes.

01:01:41.961 --> 01:01:43.428
Actually, no, I don't.

01:01:44.764 --> 01:01:47.460
There are people
that want to harm me.

01:01:48.134 --> 01:01:49.260
Bad peoples.

01:01:49.335 --> 01:01:50.393
I see.

01:01:50.469 --> 01:01:51.629
And they won't stop.

01:01:52.138 --> 01:01:54.038
Right.

01:01:54.106 --> 01:01:55.971
So for your own safety...

01:01:59.779 --> 01:02:01.246
Can we still be friends?

01:02:02.014 --> 01:02:03.447
I don't know.

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:07.148
I mean, I don't really
know who you are, do I?

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.110
That's just it.

01:02:10.623 --> 01:02:12.181
Neither do I.

01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:18.719
What is it?

01:02:18.898 --> 01:02:20.832
It's something about me.

01:02:22.034 --> 01:02:23.695
I know what DNA means,

01:02:24.637 --> 01:02:26.400
but I don't understand
the rest of it.

01:02:26.639 --> 01:02:27.901
Are you sick?

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.368
I don't feel sick.

01:02:29.842 --> 01:02:31.036
What's wrong with you?

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:32.805
Nothing's wrong with me.

01:02:34.647 --> 01:02:36.205
What are you going to do?

01:02:39.485 --> 01:02:41.544
I'm going to Berlin.

01:02:42.054 --> 01:02:44.818
I have to meet my father at
the house of Wilhelm Grimm.

01:02:45.024 --> 01:02:47.185
As in "Grimm's Fairytales"?

01:02:47.326 --> 01:02:48.350
That's right.

01:02:48.828 --> 01:02:50.386
If you say so.

01:02:50.663 --> 01:02:52.597
Did I say
the wrong thing again?

01:03:00.539 --> 01:03:02.166
Keep this.

01:03:02.241 --> 01:03:03.833
To remember me.

01:03:05.711 --> 01:03:08.202
It's a friendship bracelet.

01:03:13.219 --> 01:03:14.743
Thank you.

01:03:54.894 --> 01:03:56.327
Where's Hanna?

01:03:56.562 --> 01:03:58.291
Wow, you look rough.
Do you want some tea?

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:00.022
Had some. Who's Hanna?

01:04:00.099 --> 01:04:01.760
The girl we ate dinner
with in Morocco.

01:04:01.834 --> 01:04:04.428
She's here, or was. She
came out with me last night.

01:04:04.503 --> 01:04:06.596
How did she get here?
Is she with her father?

01:04:06.672 --> 01:04:08.139
No, she came on her own.

01:04:08.908 --> 01:04:09.966
What?

01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:12.942
Why don't you let other people
have their own style of parenting?

01:04:13.145 --> 01:04:14.874
He's promoting independence.

01:04:14.947 --> 01:04:16.938
She's like an orphan.
Call me conservative.

01:04:17.016 --> 01:04:18.313
You're inherently
conservative, darling.

01:04:18.384 --> 01:04:19.408
No, I'm not.

01:04:19.485 --> 01:04:20.816
I said we'd give her
a lift to Lille.

01:04:20.886 --> 01:04:22.148
We are going to Lille,
aren't we?

01:04:22.488 --> 01:04:24.615
I found breakfast.

01:04:25.191 --> 01:04:26.954
That's gross.

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:33.798
Your mum was so stoned,
she'd have eaten anything.

01:06:59.578 --> 01:07:02.012
We've got him.
Picking up now.

01:07:28.941 --> 01:07:31.171
<i>Do you read me? Do you read me?</i>

01:07:32.978 --> 01:07:34.411
<i>Do you read me?</i>

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.347
<i>Bring him to Wiegler.
She will ID and interview.</i>

01:07:37.416 --> 01:07:38.474
Is that what she said?

01:07:38.684 --> 01:07:41.517
<i>Orders confirmed
with her 2 minutes ago.</i>

01:07:41.653 --> 01:07:42.984
Marissa.

01:07:43.322 --> 01:07:44.653
Damn her!

01:08:10.983 --> 01:08:14.316
I feel so grounded
in the countryside.

01:08:15.788 --> 01:08:17.948
The city stifles me,

01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:22.057
emotionally,
creatively, spiritually.

01:08:23.395 --> 01:08:26.296
Places like this
bring us closer to God.

01:08:26.497 --> 01:08:27.725
God?

01:08:27.966 --> 01:08:30.662
Well, not in any
monotheistic sense.

01:08:30.903 --> 01:08:33.997
Buddha, Krishna,
the god within.

01:08:34.706 --> 01:08:36.832
Whatever you believe in.

01:08:40.645 --> 01:08:42.636
What do you
believe in, Hanna?

01:08:46.484 --> 01:08:48.247
Nothing.

01:08:57.261 --> 01:08:58.729
Everything all right?

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.567
I think so.

01:09:34.733 --> 01:09:37.292
<i>I'm not sure if it's true
that the baby can hear me,</i>

01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:39.599
<i>but at night, I sing.</i>

01:09:39.938 --> 01:09:41.929
<i>I hope she hears me.</i>

01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:44.571
<i>Was it like this
for you, Mama?</i>

01:09:44.776 --> 01:09:47.471
<i>I think I know
what she looks like.</i>

01:09:47.712 --> 01:09:50.238
<i>I can see her
when I close my eyes.</i>

01:09:50.448 --> 01:09:52.814
<i>I can hear her inside me,</i>

01:09:53.551 --> 01:09:54.780
<i>moving.</i>

01:09:54.987 --> 01:09:56.420
<i>Is that silly?</i>

01:09:57.122 --> 01:09:58.987
<i>I think it's a girl.</i>

01:09:59.324 --> 01:10:00.723
<i>I hope so.</i>

01:10:03.295 --> 01:10:04.523
<i>Erik helped me
make these tapes.</i>

01:10:04.596 --> 01:10:05.585
What?

01:10:05.664 --> 01:10:07.188
<i>He says
he will get them to you.</i>

01:10:07.266 --> 01:10:08.494
For Christ's sakes, Lewis!

01:10:08.567 --> 01:10:10.228
<i>Hello, Marissa.</i>

01:10:12.304 --> 01:10:14.602
<i>I heard you were dead.</i>

01:10:14.806 --> 01:10:16.273
Did your little girl
tell you that?

01:10:16.842 --> 01:10:18.309
<i>Even though
he knows all about me...</i>

01:10:18.377 --> 01:10:19.571
<i>What are
you listening to?</i>

01:10:19.645 --> 01:10:20.634
Self-help.

01:10:21.747 --> 01:10:23.612
<i>Are you in need of help?</i>

01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:25.509
It's good to hear you.

01:10:26.685 --> 01:10:29.176
I didn't imagine we'd have
the chance to talk.

01:10:29.254 --> 01:10:31.882
<i>You don't have her, do you?
You're not that good.</i>

01:10:31.957 --> 01:10:34.016
Oh, Erik,
you're such a flirt.

01:10:37.296 --> 01:10:38.422
Tech's on the way up.

01:10:38.497 --> 01:10:40.260
You were a good agent, Erik.

01:10:40.465 --> 01:10:43.366
Was sad to see you go dumb.

01:10:45.938 --> 01:10:47.132
What did I miss?

01:10:47.205 --> 01:10:50.197
<i>I couldn't do it anymore,
the things we did.</i>

01:10:51.677 --> 01:10:53.941
I'm sorry? With Johanna?

01:10:54.947 --> 01:10:56.505
<i>With all of them.</i>

01:10:56.882 --> 01:10:58.213
<i>With Hanna.</i>

01:10:59.051 --> 01:11:00.916
So why come back now?

01:11:02.087 --> 01:11:03.213
Tech guys.

01:11:03.288 --> 01:11:05.950
I asked you
a question, Erik.

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:10.860
Erik, are you still there?

01:11:50.535 --> 01:11:52.594
Move. Get up.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.326
Shit!

01:12:23.468 --> 01:12:25.231
Shit, shit, shit!

01:12:26.772 --> 01:12:28.171
Hanna, I think we're lost.

01:12:36.314 --> 01:12:37.338
I'm gonna have
to pull over.

01:12:37.416 --> 01:12:38.405
No. Don't.

01:12:38.483 --> 01:12:39.711
Can't see the map.

01:12:55.901 --> 01:12:58.267
Have we stopped?
I need to pee.

01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:00.904
I don't want you going
too far right now, love.

01:13:01.106 --> 01:13:02.698
I think you should stay
where you are, Sophie.

01:13:02.774 --> 01:13:03.934
Hanna, what's going on?

01:13:24.563 --> 01:13:25.791
Are we in Lille?

01:13:25.864 --> 01:13:27.593
No, we're not.
I don't know where we are.

01:13:27.666 --> 01:13:29.327
Whatever you do,

01:13:29.401 --> 01:13:30.732
don't follow me.

01:13:30.902 --> 01:13:32.665
Promise not to follow me.

01:13:32.938 --> 01:13:34.030
I promise.

01:13:44.549 --> 01:13:46.676
Thank you for
being my friend.

01:13:49.087 --> 01:13:50.213
Hanna!

01:14:28.026 --> 01:14:29.618
Titch!

01:15:32.791 --> 01:15:33.780
Hanna?

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.067
Definitely odd.

01:17:57.235 --> 01:17:58.862
Disconnected.

01:17:59.404 --> 01:18:00.530
You know,

01:18:00.739 --> 01:18:03.139
I like to think I have
a rapport with kids.

01:18:03.508 --> 01:18:04.975
You know,
I get on with them.

01:18:06.578 --> 01:18:09.843
You know, sir, it's days like
these that I really hate my job.

01:18:09.914 --> 01:18:12.007
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

01:18:12.217 --> 01:18:14.811
This is very,
very difficult.

01:18:16.755 --> 01:18:19.485
But sometimes children
are bad people, too.

01:18:19.557 --> 01:18:20.683
Stop crying.

01:18:20.959 --> 01:18:22.187
I'm not telling you anything.

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.454
Do you know this boy?

01:18:23.528 --> 01:18:25.223
- No.
- He knows you.

01:18:25.296 --> 01:18:27.662
Your friend is in
a lot of danger.

01:18:27.732 --> 01:18:29.359
I don't know anything.

01:18:30.101 --> 01:18:32.092
She said
she lived in Leipzig.

01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:33.660
She went to the
Klaus Kohle Gymnasium.

01:18:33.872 --> 01:18:35.499
Her friends
were Rudi and Gunther.

01:18:35.573 --> 01:18:38.133
She likes tennis, and
she has a dog named Trudi.

01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:39.233
She lied to you.

01:18:39.677 --> 01:18:40.905
Absolutely.

01:18:40.979 --> 01:18:44.278
She seemed lost, like
she needed taking care of.

01:18:44.616 --> 01:18:47.210
I've got something
to show you.

01:18:47.285 --> 01:18:48.411
A bit of mothering.

01:18:48.486 --> 01:18:49.544
This is Hanna's mother.

01:18:49.621 --> 01:18:51.282
Biological mother.

01:18:51.456 --> 01:18:53.856
Fifteen years ago,
she was shot to death

01:18:53.925 --> 01:18:56.086
by Hanna's father
on a camping trip.

01:18:58.029 --> 01:19:00.259
Don't you wanna see
what's inside?

01:19:02.734 --> 01:19:03.996
Say please.

01:19:04.069 --> 01:19:05.400
Please.

01:19:33.164 --> 01:19:34.961
You like her, don't you?

01:19:35.033 --> 01:19:37.831
It's okay.
I won't tell anyone.

01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:40.933
She's very pretty.

01:19:41.506 --> 01:19:42.530
Where is she?

01:19:42.874 --> 01:19:44.239
You tell me.

01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:45.842
She in lots of trouble?

01:19:46.044 --> 01:19:49.844
The worst kind, sweetheart. Some
very bad men are looking for her,

01:19:49.914 --> 01:19:52.075
and I need to find her.
I want to protect her.

01:19:58.089 --> 01:19:59.886
Do you want Hanna
to get hurt?

01:20:01.025 --> 01:20:02.356
No.

01:20:03.361 --> 01:20:06.262
She's going to Berlin,
to Wilhelm Grimm's house,

01:20:07.198 --> 01:20:08.597
to meet her dad.

01:21:51.736 --> 01:21:54.170
Hanna! Hanna, Hanna, Hanna.

01:21:54.272 --> 01:21:56.103
Come. Come.

01:21:57.375 --> 01:21:58.364
This way.

01:22:04.015 --> 01:22:06.483
Been waiting
for you a long time.

01:22:07.885 --> 01:22:09.716
What has Erik
told you about me?

01:22:10.255 --> 01:22:12.723
Wilhelm Grimm's house.
Stephanstrasse 260.

01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:15.984
10559 Berlin, Germany.

01:22:16.728 --> 01:22:18.059
That's it?

01:22:18.696 --> 01:22:20.561
He didn't tell you

01:22:21.266 --> 01:22:22.995
about my magic?

01:22:38.549 --> 01:22:39.538
What day is it?

01:22:39.617 --> 01:22:40.606
It's today, my dear.

01:22:41.085 --> 01:22:42.450
Come.

01:22:42.687 --> 01:22:44.018
Come.

01:22:55.967 --> 01:22:57.298
Sit.

01:22:57.735 --> 01:22:58.861
Sit.

01:23:00.438 --> 01:23:01.928
You're hungry.

01:23:09.814 --> 01:23:10.838
Waffles.

01:23:11.082 --> 01:23:12.106
May I have one?

01:23:12.216 --> 01:23:14.776
An egg? Of course.

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:19.485
You can eat whatever
you want, my dear. My shoe.

01:23:20.892 --> 01:23:22.951
I almost forgot.

01:23:27.632 --> 01:23:28.963
Present.

01:23:31.235 --> 01:23:32.224
For me?

01:23:36.841 --> 01:23:38.274
You will need
a fresh photograph,

01:23:38.343 --> 01:23:39.742
but everything's
in order, yes.

01:23:40.078 --> 01:23:42.672
Why do I need a piece of
paper to tell me my name?

01:23:42.747 --> 01:23:46.046
Not you. Not you, my dear,
but everyone else.

01:23:46.117 --> 01:23:48.608
We need paper and computers

01:23:48.686 --> 01:23:52.520
so we don't have to ask people
their names or look them in the face.

01:23:56.294 --> 01:23:58.023
You have a good face.

01:23:58.529 --> 01:24:00.190
You look just
like your father.

01:24:01.332 --> 01:24:03.061
And you walk like him, too.

01:24:04.202 --> 01:24:05.692
I don't walk like that.

01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:08.432
Yes, you do.
You do, my dear.

01:24:15.446 --> 01:24:16.936
Did you know my mother, too?

01:24:19.150 --> 01:24:21.015
But of course.

01:24:21.953 --> 01:24:23.784
She was a singer.

01:24:24.655 --> 01:24:26.088
A wonderful singer.

01:24:28.226 --> 01:24:29.250
Do you sing?

01:24:30.862 --> 01:24:33.660
Papa...
Erik didn't teach me.

01:24:33.965 --> 01:24:35.830
Oh, you poor child.

01:24:36.134 --> 01:24:39.399
He has truly limited you
from all the wonderful things

01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:41.367
the world has to offer.

01:24:41.572 --> 01:24:43.597
No magic.

01:24:44.342 --> 01:24:46.173
No music.

01:25:14.405 --> 01:25:15.394
I'll teach you.

01:25:20.511 --> 01:25:21.978
Is that him?

01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:28.785
Upstairs with you, my dear.
Quickly.

01:25:43.367 --> 01:25:46.734
The park is closed,
boys and girls.

01:25:51.943 --> 01:25:53.308
Where is Erik?

01:26:35.119 --> 01:26:36.916
He doesn't know much.

01:26:37.121 --> 01:26:38.952
Or he's a very good liar.

01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:40.614
He knew Johanna.

01:26:40.691 --> 01:26:41.680
Yes, of course.

01:26:41.926 --> 01:26:43.860
Bits and pieces
about the program.

01:26:44.095 --> 01:26:45.426
What does he know
about the girl?

01:26:45.630 --> 01:26:47.257
He thinks Erik's the father.

01:26:48.599 --> 01:26:50.191
Everybody thinks
Erik's her father.

01:26:50.268 --> 01:26:51.860
That's precious.

01:26:52.069 --> 01:26:53.696
Yes?

01:26:53.938 --> 01:26:55.064
This is Marissa Wiegler.

01:26:56.541 --> 01:26:57.769
Walt, I didn't...

01:26:57.842 --> 01:26:59.036
<i>Lewis is dead.</i>

01:26:59.377 --> 01:27:01.777
<i>You didn't think
it would be important to tell us?</i>

01:27:01.846 --> 01:27:03.006
<i>Why didn't you call it in?</i>

01:27:04.849 --> 01:27:06.783
<i>"One man, one day operation."</i>

01:27:07.018 --> 01:27:09.145
<i>We trusted you with
a promising agent...</i>

01:27:09.353 --> 01:27:11.821
Yes, yes, yes,
we all loved Lewis.

01:27:11.989 --> 01:27:14.787
<i>And on top of that,
you left a crime scene, Agent.</i>

01:27:14.859 --> 01:27:16.724
He was shooting
through the door, Walt.

01:27:16.794 --> 01:27:18.853
<i>As of this minute,
you are to stand down.</i>

01:27:18.963 --> 01:27:21.659
No, I'm not standing down.

01:27:22.867 --> 01:27:24.801
No, I am inches...

01:27:25.136 --> 01:27:26.899
<i>Your career is on the line.</i>

01:27:27.872 --> 01:27:30.705
Well, yes. That is fine.

01:27:33.077 --> 01:27:34.135
No.

01:27:34.745 --> 01:27:35.769
Listen.

01:27:36.013 --> 01:27:37.002
Walt.

01:29:08.439 --> 01:29:10.270
Heizinger block.

01:29:27.858 --> 01:29:29.189
Hi, boss.

01:29:29.427 --> 01:29:31.918
So off to
Grandmother's house we go.

01:30:40.364 --> 01:30:41.695
Hanna!

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.411
Sit down.

01:31:00.751 --> 01:31:02.480
Are you my father?

01:31:04.054 --> 01:31:05.043
Sit down, Hanna.

01:31:05.156 --> 01:31:06.180
Are you my father?

01:31:06.257 --> 01:31:07.349
Please, sit.

01:31:07.424 --> 01:31:08.652
Are you?

01:31:08.893 --> 01:31:10.019
Hanna.

01:31:10.327 --> 01:31:12.318
Of course I'm your father.

01:31:13.097 --> 01:31:14.189
I raised you.

01:31:14.265 --> 01:31:15.323
But Marissa said...

01:31:15.399 --> 01:31:16.423
Hanna!

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:17.660
Don't lie to me.

01:31:19.069 --> 01:31:20.730
I am your father.

01:31:20.938 --> 01:31:22.963
I've been with you
your whole life.

01:31:23.307 --> 01:31:25.036
Treated you like you're
my own flesh and blood.

01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:27.407
But I'm not your
flesh and blood.

01:31:29.146 --> 01:31:30.943
- I'm abnormal.
- No!

01:31:31.015 --> 01:31:32.505
Where was I born?

01:31:36.353 --> 01:31:38.321
Tell me the truth.

01:31:40.724 --> 01:31:43.158
You were born
in a research facility

01:31:43.394 --> 01:31:45.294
in rural Poland. Galinka.

01:31:46.931 --> 01:31:48.796
What was the research?

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.029
They took fertilized embryos

01:31:51.101 --> 01:31:53.296
and made small changes
to them to improve them.

01:31:53.671 --> 01:31:56.902
To reduce the capacity
for fear, for pity,

01:31:57.107 --> 01:32:00.235
to increase muscle strength,
heighten senses.

01:32:00.311 --> 01:32:02.939
Anything to make
a better soldier,

01:32:03.013 --> 01:32:04.480
the perfect soldier.

01:32:08.252 --> 01:32:10.413
I recruited your mother
at an abortion clinic.

01:32:11.322 --> 01:32:13.813
I recruited 20 women
the same way.

01:32:17.862 --> 01:32:19.625
There were other children?

01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:21.161
Yes.

01:32:22.132 --> 01:32:23.360
When you were two,

01:32:23.734 --> 01:32:26.225
Marissa Wiegler,
she closed the whole program.

01:32:26.303 --> 01:32:28.032
And all of this research,

01:32:29.506 --> 01:32:31.337
it was disposed of.

01:32:31.508 --> 01:32:32.532
Do you understand?

01:32:38.115 --> 01:32:39.878
I love you, Hanna.

01:32:40.284 --> 01:32:41.979
You have to know that.

01:32:45.055 --> 01:32:46.852
Because I'm a freak?

01:32:47.892 --> 01:32:49.223
No.

01:32:50.227 --> 01:32:52.127
Because you are my child.

01:33:00.404 --> 01:33:01.632
We're not finished here.

01:33:04.208 --> 01:33:05.539
Stop this!

01:33:05.743 --> 01:33:07.176
Let me go!

01:33:21.692 --> 01:33:22.886
Stop this!

01:33:35.572 --> 01:33:36.596
Hanna!

01:33:36.674 --> 01:33:38.505
Hanna, please!

01:33:39.376 --> 01:33:43.039
I tried to prepare you
for what your life would be.

01:33:43.113 --> 01:33:45.513
You didn't
prepare me for this.

01:33:49.687 --> 01:33:51.018
Run.

01:33:52.523 --> 01:33:53.751
Run.

01:34:21.952 --> 01:34:24.318
Is that
all you've got?

01:34:24.455 --> 01:34:25.581
Huh?

01:34:25.656 --> 01:34:27.248
Run, little piggy!

01:36:26.944 --> 01:36:28.809
Why now, Erik?

01:36:32.349 --> 01:36:34.715
Kids grow up.

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.478
Mr. Grimm!

01:37:13.891 --> 01:37:16.587
Mr. Grimm! Mr. Grimm?

01:38:29.366 --> 01:38:30.958
Hanna!

01:38:44.915 --> 01:38:47.076
I'm here now, Hanna.

01:40:13.403 --> 01:40:14.392
Ah.

01:40:14.971 --> 01:40:16.495
Don't worry, sweetheart.

01:40:16.673 --> 01:40:17.662
Don't!

01:40:18.408 --> 01:40:20.399
Don't move any closer!

01:40:22.546 --> 01:40:25.106
Hanna, I can help you.

01:40:25.782 --> 01:40:27.113
Please.

01:40:28.452 --> 01:40:31.182
I don't want to
hurt anyone anymore.

01:40:32.422 --> 01:40:34.652
I just wanna talk.

01:40:35.692 --> 01:40:37.922
It's over now, Marissa.

01:40:41.832 --> 01:40:43.459
Let me go.

01:40:44.801 --> 01:40:46.132
Hanna!

01:40:47.604 --> 01:40:49.970
Don't walk away
from me, young lady!

01:43:23.426 --> 01:43:25.621
I just missed your heart.

01:47:57.734 --> 01:48:00.669
<i>Music.
A combination of sounds,</i>

01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:05.330
<i>with a view to beauty of form and
expression of emotion.</i>
