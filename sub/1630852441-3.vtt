00:14.625 --> 00:15.625
Come on!

00:16.291 --> 00:20.458
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-The party's just begun</i>

00:20.541 --> 00:24.000
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-Maths is so much fun</i>

00:24.083 --> 00:24.916
All right!

00:25.000 --> 00:27.125
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-Everyone</i>

00:27.208 --> 00:29.375
<i>-Party!</i>
<i>-Maths is fun</i>

00:29.458 --> 00:30.708
<i>We're the babies</i>

00:30.791 --> 00:32.166
<i>You're the big kids</i>

00:32.250 --> 00:35.500
<i>Teach us all the maths you know</i>
<i>One, two, three, let's go</i>

00:35.583 --> 00:36.416
<i>Zu ba!</i>

00:36.500 --> 00:37.833
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:37.916 --> 00:39.916
<i>The party's just begun</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:45.291
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-This party's number one!</i>

00:45.375 --> 00:46.875
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:54.625 --> 00:58.583
<i>The babies are playing stop-and-go</i>
<i>on the playground today.</i>

00:59.250 --> 01:00.083
<i>Tíng.</i>

01:01.375 --> 01:02.666
Okay.

01:06.708 --> 01:08.416
Tilly, is it time to go yet?

01:08.500 --> 01:10.958
Yeah. Vroom! Go!

01:14.916 --> 01:16.708
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:16.791 --> 01:17.916
<i>Tíng.</i>

01:18.750 --> 01:21.833
What? "Stop"? But it was just time to go.

01:23.041 --> 01:23.875
<i>Tíng!</i>

01:23.958 --> 01:26.625
Tilly, stop stopping.

01:29.833 --> 01:30.916
<i>Tíng.</i>

01:33.000 --> 01:33.958
<i>Tíng.</i>

01:37.000 --> 01:37.833
<i>Tíng.</i>

01:39.750 --> 01:42.708
-Okay. Now we can go!
-Yeah!

01:42.791 --> 01:44.041
Stop!

01:44.125 --> 01:46.625
No, not again.

01:46.708 --> 01:49.125
I have something to show all of you.

01:49.208 --> 01:50.583
What is it, Franny?

01:51.250 --> 01:52.250
Come see.

01:52.833 --> 01:53.750
Follow me!

01:53.833 --> 01:55.166
Cheetah speed!

01:56.083 --> 01:59.708
-Cheetah speed!
-Let's go!

02:02.416 --> 02:03.291
<i>Tíng.</i>

02:06.791 --> 02:13.208
It's a new game
that will thrill and mystify you all.

02:14.500 --> 02:18.208
I call it the box of mystery.

02:19.916 --> 02:21.250
Drumroll, please!

02:25.291 --> 02:31.291
Presenting the box of mystery!

02:34.291 --> 02:36.083
How does it work, Franny?

02:36.166 --> 02:42.166
Find the shapes from the side of the box,
the box will open!

02:42.250 --> 02:44.833
What's inside?!

02:45.833 --> 02:48.416
That is the mystery.

02:48.500 --> 02:52.458
Is it balloons? Or a goldfish?

02:52.541 --> 02:55.500
Or maybe dirty socks?

02:56.583 --> 02:59.000
What? I like dirty socks.

03:00.458 --> 03:03.000
-What shapes do we look for, Franny?
-Yeah.

03:03.083 --> 03:07.375
Look closely, and the box will tell you.

03:08.291 --> 03:10.916
Hey, that one looks like a square!

03:11.000 --> 03:13.708
And I know just where to find one!

03:15.750 --> 03:16.833
Now, where is it?

03:17.833 --> 03:18.666
There it is!

03:19.916 --> 03:21.625
Hi, Snaily.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.666
Hey! Hey, I found it!

03:27.458 --> 03:32.125
I found it! This book has a square on it.
Is that the right shape?

03:33.250 --> 03:36.041
Yes! One mystery is solved!

03:38.208 --> 03:43.541
The next shape has three sides.
What is it?

03:44.541 --> 03:46.041
That's a triangle!

03:46.125 --> 03:48.833
And I know where one is.

03:51.083 --> 03:52.041
Okay.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.958
-That's not it.
-What's there?

03:59.208 --> 04:00.333
I found it!

04:02.875 --> 04:08.166
Ta-da! A triangle. See? Three sides.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.541
Is that the shape
you were looking for, Franny?

04:12.291 --> 04:14.500
And the second mystery is solved!

04:14.583 --> 04:18.083
-Yay!
-Yes! I got one!

04:18.583 --> 04:25.500
Now, can you find the shape
with no sides at all?

04:25.583 --> 04:28.791
For that is the greatest mystery!

04:28.875 --> 04:32.208
Oh, that's a circle.
Yeah. Lulu can find it.

04:34.083 --> 04:36.875
Oh, I thought that would be the hard one.

04:39.791 --> 04:41.083
Hi, Cookitybot.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.500
Bye, Cookitybot.

04:48.291 --> 04:50.958
Look! A circle!

04:52.291 --> 04:55.125
See? Is that the right shape, Franny?

04:56.125 --> 04:58.458
And the third mystery is solved!

04:58.541 --> 04:59.833
All right!

04:59.916 --> 05:04.250
The box of mystery needs one more shape,

05:04.333 --> 05:08.458
a shape that has a lot of sides.

05:08.541 --> 05:10.583
That <i>is</i> a lot of sides.

05:11.083 --> 05:14.083
Yeah, that's too many for me to count.

05:14.166 --> 05:19.625
Well, we could sing the counting song.
That'll remind us how to count high.

05:20.208 --> 05:22.125
Yeah! Good idea, Kip.

05:22.208 --> 05:23.375
<i>One, two, three</i>

05:24.458 --> 05:25.541
<i>Four, five, six</i>

05:26.375 --> 05:29.250
<i>Seven, eight, nine, ten</i>

05:29.333 --> 05:30.500
<i>Let's do it again!</i>

05:30.583 --> 05:32.666
<i>-One, two, three</i>
<i>-One, two, three</i>

05:32.750 --> 05:34.708
<i>-Four, five, six</i>
<i>-Four, five, six</i>

05:34.791 --> 05:37.583
<i>Seven, eight, nine, ten</i>

05:38.583 --> 05:42.416
<i>Can we please count noodles?</i>
<i>One, two, three</i>

05:42.500 --> 05:46.708
<i>Let's count hats</i>
<i>There's one, two, three, four I see</i>

05:47.291 --> 05:49.166
<i>One dog, two ducks</i>

05:49.250 --> 05:51.208
<i>Three cars, four trucks</i>

05:51.291 --> 05:55.291
<i>When it's time to go to sleep</i>
<i>We can count sheep</i>

05:55.375 --> 05:56.541
<i>One, two, three</i>

05:57.541 --> 05:58.625
<i>Four, five, six</i>

05:59.583 --> 06:02.250
<i>Seven, eight, nine, ten</i>

06:03.458 --> 06:05.833
<i>Let's count to ten from beginning to end</i>

06:05.916 --> 06:09.500
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six</i>
<i>Seven, eight, nine, ten</i>

06:11.333 --> 06:14.083
Okay. Let's count.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.416
One, two, three,

06:17.500 --> 06:19.875
four, five, six,

06:19.958 --> 06:22.500
seven, eight. Eight sides!

06:22.583 --> 06:25.375
-Wow!
-So many.

06:26.833 --> 06:29.333
What shape has eight sides?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.666
<i>Tíng.</i>

06:35.416 --> 06:40.666
Tilly, we'll play stop-and-go again later.
We've got to find this shape.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.333
I don't know what this shape is called.

06:45.416 --> 06:49.375
Well, shapes are part of maths, so maybe…

06:49.458 --> 06:50.625
Maths Molly!

06:51.125 --> 06:52.750
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

06:52.833 --> 06:55.875
Maths Molly!

07:00.791 --> 07:03.750
Come on, big kids! Let's go, go, go!

07:06.166 --> 07:09.791
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

07:09.875 --> 07:13.250
We need to find a shape with eight sides.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.416
-Let's start.
-Yeah.

07:17.625 --> 07:20.708
That shape has four sides. See?

07:20.791 --> 07:22.500
One, two,

07:22.583 --> 07:24.250
three, four.

07:25.041 --> 07:27.625
Big kids, what's that shape?

07:28.791 --> 07:30.083
<i>Square.</i>

07:30.666 --> 07:31.750
That's right.

07:34.166 --> 07:35.083
Look!

07:35.166 --> 07:37.208
Three sides!

07:37.708 --> 07:40.750
One, two, three!

07:42.000 --> 07:43.333
What's that?

07:44.833 --> 07:46.500
<i>Triangle.</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:48.500
-Yeah.
-Triangle.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.791
And that shape has no sides.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.041
What's it called?

07:57.791 --> 07:59.375
<i>Circle.</i>

08:00.083 --> 08:04.083
Right! A nice round circle.

08:08.958 --> 08:12.000
<i>Tíng!</i>

08:12.083 --> 08:16.791
Oh no, we can't stop now, Tilly.
We're about to learn that shape.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.583
This shape has--

08:20.666 --> 08:22.166
one, two,

08:22.250 --> 08:24.458
three, four, five,

08:24.541 --> 08:28.000
six, seven, eight-- eight sides!

08:28.583 --> 08:30.416
What is it, big kids?

08:31.875 --> 08:33.416
<i>Octagon.</i>

08:34.333 --> 08:36.791
Octagon!

08:37.333 --> 08:39.000
That's what it's called!

08:39.500 --> 08:43.041
Yeah, but where can I find an octagon?

08:45.416 --> 08:49.833
-What's that?
-That stop sign has eight sides!

08:50.333 --> 08:53.666
Tilly, you found an octagon!

08:55.083 --> 09:00.458
Wait. You knew the whole time,
and we didn't listen to you.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.166
I'm sorry, Tilly.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.875
You did a great job, Tilly.

09:09.458 --> 09:14.625
Now, let's go and open the box of mystery!

09:14.708 --> 09:17.208
Oh wait! Wait!

09:17.750 --> 09:18.958
Maths Party?

09:19.041 --> 09:20.208
Oh right, Lulu.

09:20.875 --> 09:24.166
Maths Party!

09:24.250 --> 09:25.666
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:25.750 --> 09:27.166
<i>We did math</i>s

09:27.250 --> 09:29.333
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:30.250 --> 09:33.166
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

09:33.250 --> 09:36.625
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

09:36.708 --> 09:37.541
Yeah!

09:37.625 --> 09:39.250
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:39.333 --> 09:40.666
<i>We did maths</i>

09:40.750 --> 09:43.000
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:43.666 --> 09:46.333
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

09:46.416 --> 09:51.166
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

09:51.250 --> 09:53.791
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

09:54.375 --> 09:56.958
<i>We love maths!</i>

09:59.208 --> 10:01.958
An octagon. Eight sides.

10:02.041 --> 10:06.875
Who's ready to see
what's inside the box of mystery?

10:06.958 --> 10:10.250
-I am! Me!
-I am!

10:10.333 --> 10:15.375
Tilly, since you found the octagon,
would you like to open it?

10:17.416 --> 10:19.375
-Can't wait to see.
-Me too.

10:23.416 --> 10:24.250
Wow!

10:25.625 --> 10:26.875
What is it?

10:27.541 --> 10:28.541
I know.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.916
It's a music box.

10:32.416 --> 10:36.625
Yep. Because the surprise
in the box is a brand-new song!

10:36.708 --> 10:38.291
A song about shapes!

10:38.375 --> 10:39.708
Ooh, let's sing it.

10:44.875 --> 10:47.000
<i>Shape it, shape it, shape it</i>

10:48.041 --> 10:50.416
<i>No corners, round and smooth</i>

10:50.500 --> 10:52.833
<i>That's a circle, let's all move</i>

10:53.416 --> 10:56.083
<i>Three straight sides with three angles</i>

10:56.166 --> 10:58.791
<i>-One, two, three</i>
<i>-A triangle</i>

10:58.875 --> 11:01.750
<i>Four straight sides, all equal there</i>

11:01.833 --> 11:04.458
<i>Let's all jump into a square</i>

11:05.000 --> 11:07.375
<i>Four sides, all right angles</i>

11:07.458 --> 11:09.958
<i>Two sides longer, a rectangle</i>

11:10.041 --> 11:15.666
<i>Triangle, circle, that's a square</i>
<i>Shape it, shape it, everywhere</i>

11:16.291 --> 11:18.625
<i>Eight sides, what's going on?</i>

11:18.708 --> 11:21.500
<i>Shape it, shape it, an octagon</i>

11:21.583 --> 11:27.166
<i>Triangle, circle, that's a square</i>
<i>Shape it, shape it, everywhere</i>

11:27.250 --> 11:33.833
<i>We've done great, we've gone far</i>
<i>Shape it, shape it, we earned a star</i>

11:36.333 --> 11:38.333
Thank you, Sticketybot!

11:39.333 --> 11:42.041
A sticker for you, big kids.

11:42.125 --> 11:47.000
You helped us with our shape hunt.
We couldn't have done it without you.

11:47.958 --> 11:48.958
Bye!

11:51.125 --> 11:53.166
Bye-bye! Bye!

12:06.375 --> 12:08.875
<i>The babies are playing outside today.</i>

12:12.208 --> 12:13.041
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

12:13.791 --> 12:16.458
That was funny, Clickety Clock.

12:17.833 --> 12:19.791
What time is it, big kids?

12:21.708 --> 12:22.916
<i>Time to eat.</i>

12:23.000 --> 12:24.625
Yay!

12:25.375 --> 12:27.041
I'm hungry.

12:27.125 --> 12:31.458
Me too.
But we should clean up our toys first.

12:31.541 --> 12:34.541
-Good idea.
-Yeah, I got the bubbles.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.125
Yay! Lunch time!

13:01.791 --> 13:02.625
Yummy!

13:02.708 --> 13:05.666
All right! Sandwich day!

13:05.750 --> 13:08.458
I love sandwiches.

13:08.541 --> 13:12.250
These are just the way
I like them. No crust.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.208
And they're cut into triangles.

13:15.291 --> 13:18.125
My favourite shape.

13:18.625 --> 13:22.458
Well, sometimes sandwiches are square,
but they're still yummy,

13:22.541 --> 13:24.166
so you can't go wrong.

13:24.666 --> 13:27.625
Tortilla chips are triangles too.

13:27.708 --> 13:28.541
See?

13:29.958 --> 13:33.125
All the best foods are triangles!

13:33.208 --> 13:35.291
Triangle noodles?

13:36.416 --> 13:38.500
Maybe not noodles, but…

13:38.583 --> 13:40.416
Cake.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.208
Pie.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.916
Pizza!

13:48.583 --> 13:52.458
No, Tilly. Don't eat the floating pizza.

13:55.291 --> 13:57.916
I just had the best idea!

13:58.000 --> 14:01.541
After lunch,
I'm gonna play a triangle game.

14:03.833 --> 14:07.458
Here comes the bus around the corner.

14:08.750 --> 14:11.791
Hello? Can you hear me? Hello?

14:15.833 --> 14:17.916
Franny, what are you doing?

14:19.666 --> 14:24.833
Running in triangles!

14:26.500 --> 14:30.791
-That's so cool! I'm going to catch you.
-No way!

14:30.875 --> 14:31.708
Yes way!

14:33.208 --> 14:37.291
Hey, look. I'm making a hopping triangle.

14:39.458 --> 14:43.375
-Running in triangles is hard.
-Yeah.

14:43.875 --> 14:47.750
Can we play a different triangle game?
With less running?

14:47.833 --> 14:48.958
Like what?

14:51.333 --> 14:55.625
Oh! The What's It Toy! He always has
what you need when you need it.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.125
-Let's catch him!
-Okay.

14:57.208 --> 14:59.083
Can you guys help us? Come on!

14:59.166 --> 15:01.708
Okay, Franny! We're coming.

15:01.791 --> 15:05.291
<i>What's it? What's in the What's It?</i>
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

15:05.375 --> 15:09.458
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>
<i>I want to know, and how</i>

15:09.541 --> 15:12.833
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>
<i>I want to know right now!</i>

15:12.916 --> 15:13.958
<i>-Does it swirl?</i>
<i>-Does it splurt?</i>

15:14.041 --> 15:14.916
<i>-Does it twiddle?</i>
<i>-Does it blink?</i>

15:15.000 --> 15:15.875
<i>-Is it rough?</i>
<i>-Is it smooth?</i>

15:15.958 --> 15:16.791
<i>-Is it brown?</i>
<i>-Is it pink?</i>

15:16.875 --> 15:17.791
<i>-Is it cold?</i>
<i>-Is it cuddly?</i>

15:17.875 --> 15:18.833
<i>-Is it nice?</i>
<i>-Is it mean?</i>

15:18.916 --> 15:22.583
<i>Is it something in-between?</i>
<i>Something like I've never seen?</i>

15:22.666 --> 15:26.291
<i>What's it? What's in the What's It?</i>
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

15:26.375 --> 15:29.958
<i>What's it? What's in the What's It?</i>
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

15:30.041 --> 15:33.250
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>
<i>I want to know, and how</i>

15:33.333 --> 15:35.375
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

15:35.458 --> 15:38.416
<i>I want to know, I want to know</i>
<i>I want to know right now!</i>

15:38.500 --> 15:39.333
<i>Right now!</i>

15:44.416 --> 15:45.375
Here he comes!

15:45.875 --> 15:48.000
What's It, stop!

15:48.083 --> 15:49.791
I mean, please stop.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.541
-We got him, Franny.
-Yeah.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.208
-Thanks, guys!
-Yeah.

15:55.291 --> 15:58.916
-Come on, Tilly. Let's go play.
-Yeah. Let's go.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.750
What's inside?

16:00.833 --> 16:02.375
Let's see!

16:05.208 --> 16:06.666
It's… it's…

16:06.750 --> 16:09.000
it's chalk!

16:10.083 --> 16:11.458
-Yes!
-Cool!

16:11.541 --> 16:16.333
-Now we can draw our very own triangles!
-Yeah!

16:16.416 --> 16:18.083
Thank you, What's It.

16:18.666 --> 16:21.875
I'm going to draw a big triangle.

16:21.958 --> 16:25.500
Well, I'm going to draw
an even bigger triangle.

16:30.708 --> 16:31.958
And…

16:32.041 --> 16:33.125
go!

16:35.666 --> 16:37.291
Drawing a triangle.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.666
Okay.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.333
And…

16:45.416 --> 16:46.708
-Done!
-Done!

16:48.083 --> 16:50.250
-Come look at mine!
-Okay.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.125
Presenting my triangle.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.625
That's a great triangle, Franny.

16:56.708 --> 17:00.583
-Thank you. I worked hard on it.
-Sure did.

17:00.666 --> 17:03.166
I want to see your triangle.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.083
Okay.

17:04.166 --> 17:05.666
Turn this way.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.208
Ta-da!

17:10.875 --> 17:14.583
That's… nice, Kip.

17:15.500 --> 17:19.458
-You don't like it?
-I do. It's a nice drawing.

17:19.541 --> 17:21.958
But it's not a triangle.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.958
What? Yes, it is!

17:24.041 --> 17:26.125
See? Three sides.

17:26.833 --> 17:29.958
One, two, three.

17:30.041 --> 17:32.625
That's a triangle, yeah.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.625
That's a triangle.

17:35.708 --> 17:40.416
Yours looks different,
so it's not a triangle.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.291
What? Is too.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.041
-Is not.
-Is too.

17:44.125 --> 17:45.708
-Is not.
-Is too!

17:45.791 --> 17:47.166
-Is not.
-Is too!

17:47.250 --> 17:49.458
-Is not!
-Is too!

17:51.666 --> 17:52.500
Wasn't me.

17:57.333 --> 17:58.458
Tilly's right.

17:58.541 --> 18:01.083
It's not nice to fight.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.666
<i>Let's not fight</i>

18:04.750 --> 18:06.875
<i>Let's not fight</i>

18:08.041 --> 18:10.041
<i>It's not right</i>

18:10.708 --> 18:13.250
<i>So let's not fight</i>

18:14.041 --> 18:20.625
<i>Like the time you took my bouncy ball</i>
<i>And threw it hard on the kitchen wall</i>

18:20.708 --> 18:23.583
<i>But then you pushed me and made me fall</i>

18:23.666 --> 18:25.125
-I didn't do that.
-Yes, you did.

18:25.208 --> 18:26.666
-Did not!
-Did too!

18:26.750 --> 18:27.875
-Did not!
-Did!

18:27.958 --> 18:30.375
-No, I…
-You guys are fighting.

18:30.458 --> 18:31.833
-Oops.
-Sorry, Lulu.

18:31.916 --> 18:32.833
Sorry, Kippie.

18:33.541 --> 18:35.625
<i>Let's not fight</i>

18:36.750 --> 18:38.833
<i>Let's not fight</i>

18:39.916 --> 18:45.208
<i>It feels so right</i>
<i>When we don't fight, so let's not fight</i>

18:46.333 --> 18:48.416
<i>Let's not fight</i>

18:49.458 --> 18:53.250
-I'm sorry, Kip.
<i>-</i>Yeah, I'm sorry too, Franny.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.125
-I still like your triangle.
-Thanks.

18:56.208 --> 18:57.958
And I still like your…

18:58.458 --> 18:59.541
drawing.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.625
-What?
-Uh-oh.

19:01.708 --> 19:05.125
It's a good drawing of a triangle.

19:05.625 --> 19:08.791
That is a triangle.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.541
That is not a triangle.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.250
They look different!

19:13.333 --> 19:15.583
-Is too.
-Is not.

19:15.666 --> 19:17.333
-Is too.
-Is not.

19:17.416 --> 19:18.666
-Is too.
-Is not.

19:18.750 --> 19:19.583
Wait!

19:21.666 --> 19:24.625
Triangles are shapes, right?

19:24.708 --> 19:26.250
Yes.

19:26.333 --> 19:30.708
And shapes are maths, right?

19:30.791 --> 19:32.500
Yes.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.666
We need Maths Molly!

19:36.333 --> 19:39.416
Maths Molly!

19:41.583 --> 19:44.333
-Here she comes!
-Let's go!

19:45.333 --> 19:48.458
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

19:49.166 --> 19:52.916
Yeah. And we've got a big problem.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.875
So let's start.

19:58.958 --> 20:01.000
That's what I drew.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.458
Big kids, what's that shape?

20:04.750 --> 20:06.583
<i>Triangle.</i>

20:06.666 --> 20:08.458
Yeah. You see, Kip?

20:08.541 --> 20:11.166
That's a triangle. I told you.

20:16.291 --> 20:18.541
Yeah, but that's what I drew.

20:18.625 --> 20:21.291
Hey, big kids, what's this shape?

20:23.041 --> 20:24.541
<i>Triangle.</i>

20:25.208 --> 20:29.500
You see, Franny? Mine's a triangle too.

20:29.583 --> 20:31.625
-Wait, what?
-Yeah.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.666
They're both triangles?

20:33.750 --> 20:37.125
<i>Babies, there are lots</i>
<i>of different kinds of triangles.</i>

20:37.208 --> 20:38.875
<i>Maths Molly will show you.</i>

20:42.375 --> 20:45.708
<i>Franny drew</i>
<i>what is called an equilateral triangle,</i>

20:45.791 --> 20:48.166
<i>and Kip drew a right-angle triangle.</i>

20:48.250 --> 20:51.541
Oh, a right-angle triangle.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.500
See? I knew I was right.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.291
You were right, Kip.

20:57.375 --> 21:01.708
I guess there isn't only one way
to make a triangle.

21:02.208 --> 21:06.291
-Well, I like both of your triangles.
-Oh, me too.

21:07.416 --> 21:08.750
Thanks, you guys.

21:08.833 --> 21:12.916
Well, hey, now that we've solved
a maths problem, we can have a…

21:13.916 --> 21:16.958
Maths Party!

21:19.250 --> 21:20.666
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

21:20.750 --> 21:22.166
<i>We did maths</i>

21:22.250 --> 21:24.333
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

21:25.250 --> 21:28.166
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

21:28.250 --> 21:31.625
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

21:31.708 --> 21:32.541
Yeah!

21:32.625 --> 21:34.250
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

21:34.333 --> 21:35.666
<i>We did maths</i>

21:35.750 --> 21:38.000
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

21:38.666 --> 21:41.333
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

21:41.416 --> 21:46.166
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

21:46.250 --> 21:48.791
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

21:49.375 --> 21:51.916
<i>We love maths!</i>

21:54.541 --> 21:57.333
<i>The babies are taking their nap now.</i>

22:00.750 --> 22:02.083
Hi, Franny.

22:02.166 --> 22:05.083
I want to give you
something to sleep with.

22:05.833 --> 22:08.333
-What?
-My special pillow.

22:08.416 --> 22:10.291
It's triangle-shaped.

22:10.375 --> 22:13.958
Your favourite pillow? What, for me?

22:14.041 --> 22:17.958
Because I'm sorry
I didn't believe you about your triangle.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.375
Thanks, Franny.

22:22.083 --> 22:26.875
Wait. I want to give you my star pillow.

22:26.958 --> 22:32.500
Because you're as bright
as a big shining star.

22:34.083 --> 22:35.750
Thanks, Kip!

22:35.833 --> 22:39.000
-Well, sleep tight, Franny.
-Sleep tight.

22:40.416 --> 22:42.583
Sleep tight, Till--

22:48.125 --> 22:50.833
Thanks for helping today, big kids.

22:51.958 --> 22:53.000
Bye now.
