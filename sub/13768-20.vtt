(grunts):

Those kids!

Not my  Frampton Comes Alive.

(Hal grunting)

00:34.702 --> 00:35.911
Ha-oh...!

00:35.953 --> 00:38.873
"Honest, Dad, we didn't even

00:35.953 --> 00:38.873
know you had a watch."

00:38.914 --> 00:39.874
(blowing)

00:39.915 --> 00:42.083

00:42.125 --> 00:45.086
Thank God they paved

00:42.125 --> 00:45.086
the driveway last year.

LOIS:

01:18.161 --> 01:19.371
Jury Duty?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.916
They want me to do jury duty?

01:21.957 --> 01:23.124
I can't believe this.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.292
You can't do it.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.003
You simply can't do it.

01:26.045 --> 01:27.128
Spring break is coming up.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.839
The boys are going

01:27.170 --> 01:28.839
to be out of school.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.799
I can't be expected

01:28.881 --> 01:30.799
to handle them by myself.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.134
I'm sorry, you're

01:30.841 --> 01:33.134
just going to have

01:30.841 --> 01:33.134
to tell them no!

01:33.176 --> 01:35.303
That's not one of the options,

01:33.176 --> 01:35.303
Hal.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.597
What are they thinking

01:36.638 --> 01:38.640
forcing someone

01:36.638 --> 01:38.640
to sit on a jury?

01:38.682 --> 01:40.183
This is America!

01:40.225 --> 01:41.643
I don't have a choice.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.521
Oh... yes, you do.

01:44.563 --> 01:47.608
You want to get out

01:44.563 --> 01:47.608
of jury duty?

01:47.649 --> 01:50.151
You just let me handle this.

01:50.193 --> 01:54.281
ALL: We, the jury,

01:50.193 --> 01:54.281
promise to faithfully uphold...

01:56.075 --> 01:57.158
This is going to be great.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.160
I've never been

01:57.200 --> 01:59.160
ice fishing before.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.371
It combines

01:59.202 --> 02:01.371
my two favorite things in life:

02:01.413 --> 02:04.207
ice and holes.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.876
Just a bunch of guys

02:04.249 --> 02:05.876
roughing it.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.962
A true test of courage

02:05.918 --> 02:07.962
and determination.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.088
Man against the elements.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.465
No crust on mine, please

02:09.129 --> 02:11.465
and thank you.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.883
I hope you guys packed

02:12.925 --> 02:15.010
enough toilet paper

02:12.925 --> 02:15.010
for  four  people.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.012
(cheering)

02:15.052 --> 02:17.012
You're kidding me.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.847
How'd you get Piama to

02:17.054 --> 02:18.847
give you permission?

02:18.889 --> 02:20.181
I don't need

02:18.889 --> 02:20.181
my wife's permission.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.475
I baited her into a fight,

02:21.516 --> 02:23.894
and she kicked me out

02:21.516 --> 02:23.894
for a couple days.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.312
(laughing)

02:26.396 --> 02:27.564
Oh, my God, Dewey.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.190
You're not going

02:27.606 --> 02:29.190
to believe what just happened.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.609
Where were you?

02:30.651 --> 02:32.277
We were supposed to go exploring

02:30.651 --> 02:32.277
in the sewer!

02:32.319 --> 02:35.072
I waited two hours for you!

02:32.319 --> 02:35.072
Dewey,

02:35.114 --> 02:36.865
you're not listening.

02:35.114 --> 02:36.865
This is incredible.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.199
But you promised!

02:38.241 --> 02:40.911
You said that when spring break

02:38.241 --> 02:40.911
started you would take me.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.789
I did all  your  chores,

02:40.953 --> 02:43.789
I did all  your  homework,

02:43.831 --> 02:46.291
I took  your  antibiotics

02:43.831 --> 02:46.291
for you, I put...

02:46.333 --> 02:47.709
Dewey, just shut up.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.671
We're trying to tell you

02:47.751 --> 02:50.671
something important.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.048
We just saw

02:50.712 --> 02:53.048
Stevie's mom naked.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.883
And she's a total babe.

02:54.925 --> 02:55.843
It was amazing.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.927
We were over at Stevie's

02:56.969 --> 02:58.053
getting stuff for the sewer

02:58.095 --> 03:00.221
when all of a sudden,

02:58.095 --> 03:00.221
we hear something behind us.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.683
We turn around

03:00.263 --> 03:02.683
and there she was.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.392
In the hallway. Naked!

03:04.434 --> 03:06.394
Buck-naked-- except

03:04.434 --> 03:06.394
for her shower cap.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.271
It was crazy.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.271
First she was screaming,

03:08.313 --> 03:11.232
then Stevie was screaming,

03:08.313 --> 03:11.232
then I was screaming...

03:11.274 --> 03:13.027
Yeah, why'd I do that?

03:13.068 --> 03:15.236
And then she tore the curtains

03:13.068 --> 03:15.236
off the wall to cover up.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.156
But you could still

03:15.278 --> 03:17.156
see right through

03:15.278 --> 03:17.156
the curtains.

03:17.196 --> 03:19.240
I'm so glad they

03:17.196 --> 03:19.240
just remodeled.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.035
That is not a good reason!

03:21.076 --> 03:24.079
Mom walks around here naked

03:21.076 --> 03:24.079
all the time!

03:24.121 --> 03:26.247
She was naked this morning.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.247
She was naked in the...

03:26.289 --> 03:29.250
Dewey... if you just combined

03:26.289 --> 03:29.250
those two things in my head

03:29.292 --> 03:31.419
I will kill you!

03:31.461 --> 03:32.713
No, we're good.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.923
So, anyway,

03:32.754 --> 03:34.923
she was crawling

03:32.754 --> 03:34.923
down the hall...

03:36.008 --> 03:37.051
Hal, I've got to get going.

03:37.092 --> 03:37.968
Where are the boys?

03:38.010 --> 03:39.260
They went to the library.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.261
I know, I know.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.847
But if they were doing something

03:41.889 --> 03:43.557
really dangerous,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.557
they'd have come up

03:43.598 --> 03:45.059
with a better lie.

03:45.100 --> 03:45.976
So...

03:46.018 --> 03:47.728
deliberations start today.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.063
Nervous?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.063
Nice try, Hal.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.272
You know I can't talk

03:49.104 --> 03:51.272
about the trial.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.733
(chuckling):

03:51.314 --> 03:52.733
Okay. Okay.

03:52.774 --> 03:56.070
So, is the councilman as tall

03:52.774 --> 03:56.070
as he seems to be on TV?

03:56.111 --> 03:57.278
Hal...

03:56.111 --> 03:57.278
I knew it!

03:57.320 --> 03:59.280
Your eyebrow went up.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.280
It did not.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.908
It's the panty bandit,

03:59.322 --> 04:00.908
isn't it?

04:01.616 --> 04:03.535
This isn't right, Lois.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.703
We're married.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.287
We tell each other everything.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.289
We've never kept

04:06.329 --> 04:08.289
secrets from each other

04:08.331 --> 04:09.708
in our entire relationship.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.001
What are you talking about?

04:11.043 --> 04:12.711
I keep secrets from you

04:11.043 --> 04:12.711
all the time.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.088
Oh, fine, go!

04:14.129 --> 04:19.551
Don't want to keep you

04:14.129 --> 04:19.551
from your big secret trial.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.100
Thank you very much.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.809
(chuckling)

04:27.851 --> 04:28.894
For what?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.312
Oh, nothing.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.312
Nothing at all.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.900
You didn't say a word.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.236
(chuckling)

04:42.407 --> 04:43.366
This sucks.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.910
We've been here 15 hours.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.620
We haven't caught a single fish.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.997
How much longer

04:46.661 --> 04:48.997
is this going to take?

04:49.039 --> 04:50.124
You never know.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.333
I've been ice fishing

04:50.165 --> 04:52.333
my entire life.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.919
Never even seen a fish.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.045
I'm with Francis.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.338
I got bored

04:55.087 --> 04:57.338
on the drive down here.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.590
Can we at least

04:57.380 --> 04:58.590
talk about something?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.259
About what?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.259
I don't know.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.635
We could use this opportunity

05:01.676 --> 05:04.304
to get to know each other

05:01.676 --> 05:04.304
a little better.

05:06.473 --> 05:11.436
You know, one time I walked in

05:06.473 --> 05:11.436
on my two dads making love.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.734
Guilty.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.360
Not guilty.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.196
And... guilty.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.074
That's seven guilty

05:21.238 --> 05:24.074
and five not guilty.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.034
So, I guess the point

05:24.116 --> 05:26.034
of contention for those of you

05:26.076 --> 05:28.078
who don't think that Marty did

05:26.076 --> 05:28.078
steal the motorcycle...

05:28.120 --> 05:29.412
Look, if it'll get us

05:28.120 --> 05:29.412
out of here earlier,

05:29.454 --> 05:32.833
I don't mind

05:29.454 --> 05:32.833
changing my vote.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.833
What?

05:32.874 --> 05:34.417
I don't feel that

05:32.874 --> 05:34.417
strongly either way.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.585
Yeah, me, too.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.838
Which side was winning again?

05:37.879 --> 05:39.673
This is not a question

05:37.879 --> 05:39.673
of winning.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.424
And I don't think

05:39.714 --> 05:41.424
we should be voting

05:41.466 --> 05:43.677
whichever way gets us out

05:41.466 --> 05:43.677
of here the fasted.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.096
Well, we have to have

05:43.718 --> 05:46.096
some basis for deciding.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.389
There was a trial.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.389
And evidence.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.475
And laws.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.475
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.852
Let's just vote one more time

05:51.893 --> 05:54.104
before we, you know

05:51.893 --> 05:54.104
get into all that detail.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.189
We might just get lucky.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.065
Do the five people

05:55.230 --> 05:57.065
who voted not guilty

05:57.107 --> 05:58.399
want to change their votes?

05:58.441 --> 05:59.484
Me.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.484
Guilty.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.484
Whatever.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.569
There you go.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.569
It's unanimous.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.487
Wait. Wait!

06:02.529 --> 06:05.406
What do you think you're doing?!

06:05.448 --> 06:07.784
You can't send

06:05.448 --> 06:07.784
a 17-year-old kid to jail

06:07.826 --> 06:10.411
just because you want

06:07.826 --> 06:10.411
to go home early.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.331
For God's sake, we took an oath!

06:12.371 --> 06:13.832
Lady, did you vote guilty?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.000
Yes, because...

06:15.042 --> 06:15.917
Then there's no problem.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.418
We're all just agreeing

06:15.959 --> 06:17.418
with you.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.545
Let's go.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.380
Fine.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.720
Then I vote not guilty.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.441
This is cool.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.152
There's no alligators

06:40.483 --> 06:42.152
down here, right?

06:42.194 --> 06:43.362
No, that's just made up.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.280
But if there were,

06:43.402 --> 06:45.280
it'd probably be blind.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.157
Or albino.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.157
Or transparent!

06:47.199 --> 06:48.533
But that's not real.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.494
This is so cool.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.288
He hasn't shut up all morning.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.457
I mean, I was just as excited

06:53.330 --> 06:56.457
the first time Francis took us.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.043
It's actually kind of cute.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.127
Did you get the snake?

06:59.169 --> 07:00.379
Right here.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.341
They'll be able

07:02.089 --> 07:04.341
to hear him screaming in Russia.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.466
Dude, finish your story.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.718
Oh, right. So, then, we noticed

07:06.760 --> 07:08.469
she was standing there...

07:06.760 --> 07:08.469
buck-naked.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.264
And then I went like this...

07:08.511 --> 07:10.264
(gasps)

07:10.305 --> 07:12.182
And then Malcolm

07:10.305 --> 07:12.182
was like this... (gasps)

07:12.224 --> 07:13.183
It was incredible.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.475
The sun

07:13.225 --> 07:14.475
was coming through

07:14.517 --> 07:15.685
the window behind her.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.020
It looked like

07:15.727 --> 07:17.020
she was glowing.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.440
A naked, glowing angel.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.484
Hey, Stevie,

07:21.983 --> 07:23.484
back me up on this.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.320
That's what she

07:23.526 --> 07:25.320
looked like, right?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.530
Can we go now?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.530
I get the lead.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.116
No, rear.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.491
No, wait, front.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.452
I'll scout ahead.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.957
What?

07:35.414 --> 07:36.957
You're talking

07:35.414 --> 07:36.957
about his mom.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.125
Change the subject.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.126
Show some class.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.420
Oh, okay, I get it.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.547
Whoo, Stevie, is that you

07:41.461 --> 07:44.547
or the sewer?

07:46.007 --> 07:47.508
ARTIE:

07:46.007 --> 07:47.508
It turns out it wasn't

07:47.550 --> 07:48.802
a boil they removed

07:48.843 --> 07:53.140
but the vestiges

07:48.843 --> 07:53.140
of my unborn twin.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.557
Okay, let's just go.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.518
Yeah.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.518
That sounds good.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.518
Good idea.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.355
Best idea I've

07:57.560 --> 08:00.355
heard all day.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.525
Okay, here's something

08:02.565 --> 08:04.525
interesting.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.445
There's a gigantic  bear

08:04.567 --> 08:06.445
out there.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.528
Don't worry

08:06.486 --> 08:07.528
about it.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.530
There are grizzlies

08:07.570 --> 08:09.530
all over.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.907
Just part of living in Alaska.

08:10.949 --> 08:11.741
How far away is it?

08:11.783 --> 08:14.744
(metal clattering,

08:11.783 --> 08:14.744
bear snarling)

08:14.786 --> 08:16.496
(whimpering)

08:19.458 --> 08:22.961
Well...

08:19.458 --> 08:22.961
answer the question.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.254
(doorbell rings)

08:24.296 --> 08:26.340
Uh, it's open.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.466
"The body was found..."

08:27.507 --> 08:29.343
I thought we were having

08:27.507 --> 08:29.343
lunch today.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.927
What? Oh, I'm sorry.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.553
I...

08:30.969 --> 08:32.553
What's all this?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.555
Uh, just some

08:32.595 --> 08:34.555
research I'm doing

08:34.597 --> 08:36.557
on the trial Lois

08:34.597 --> 08:36.557
got assigned to.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.767
My God. The Reyes case?

08:37.809 --> 08:40.728
Did she say anything about

08:37.809 --> 08:40.728
the four-fingered magician?

08:40.770 --> 08:41.855
Was he any good?

08:41.896 --> 08:43.398
She won't tell me  anything.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.442
I had to dig all

08:43.440 --> 08:45.442
this stuff up on my own.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.195
Half the information is being

08:45.484 --> 08:48.195
suppressed from the jury.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.405
Now Lois will have

08:48.236 --> 08:50.405
to find Monahan guilty.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.865
Why wouldn't she?

08:50.447 --> 08:51.865
He did it.

08:51.906 --> 08:52.949
Oh, you're a fool.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.285
Everyone knows that

08:52.991 --> 08:55.285
the wife killed him.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.453
What are you talking about?

08:56.495 --> 08:57.496
She loved him.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.621
Didn't you read the letter?

08:58.663 --> 08:59.956
If she was so innocent,

08:59.998 --> 09:02.250
how come she didn't admit

08:59.998 --> 09:02.250
to being married before?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.584
Because she was underage

09:03.626 --> 09:05.586
and it was annulled

09:03.626 --> 09:05.586
a week later.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.838
It means absolutely nothing.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.840
The judge already ruled that

09:06.880 --> 09:08.840
inadmissible.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.966
This is the same judge

09:10.008 --> 09:12.427
that wouldn't allow the

09:10.008 --> 09:12.427
cabdriver to testify!

09:12.469 --> 09:14.221
Well... if the wife did it,

09:14.262 --> 09:19.600
why did  four  witnesses say they

09:14.262 --> 09:19.600
saw a  man  leave the crime scene?

09:19.642 --> 09:22.770
Oh. You mean a man...

09:22.812 --> 09:24.647
like  this.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.107
You just drew hair on!

09:26.149 --> 09:27.775
And if I could do it,

09:26.149 --> 09:27.775
she could do it.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.861
Did you know that she

09:27.817 --> 09:29.861
spent two years working

09:29.903 --> 09:31.530
at the Windmill Dinner Theater?

09:32.364 --> 09:33.865
Let me see that.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.333
Okay, here's our mark.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.544
When we came down here

09:43.375 --> 09:45.544
with Francis,

09:45.585 --> 09:47.628
this is the farthest

09:45.585 --> 09:47.628
we've ever gone.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.005
DEWEY:

09:47.670 --> 09:49.005
This is it?

09:49.047 --> 09:50.631
This is as far

09:49.047 --> 09:50.631
as you went?

09:50.673 --> 09:53.260
Who would brag

09:50.673 --> 09:53.260
about this?

09:50.673 --> 09:53.260
(splashing)

09:53.301 --> 09:54.928
(gasps):

09:53.301 --> 09:54.928
Mr. Alligator?

09:54.969 --> 09:57.638
So, Stevie, did your mom

09:54.969 --> 09:57.638
go to college?

09:57.680 --> 09:58.639
What?

09:57.680 --> 09:58.639
You know.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.641
Did she get a degree

09:58.681 --> 10:00.641
or something?

10:00.683 --> 10:02.269
I'll bet she was

10:00.683 --> 10:02.269
in a sorority.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.354
Wait a minute.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.354
Unless we thought some girl

10:04.396 --> 10:07.815
named Molly Hatchet ruled,

10:04.396 --> 10:07.815
this isn't our mark.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.317
No, this has to be it.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.112
We went right, right,

10:09.359 --> 10:12.112
straight, left, right, left,

10:12.153 --> 10:13.905
straight,

10:12.153 --> 10:13.905
and right again.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.241
No. We went right,

10:13.947 --> 10:16.241
left, left,

10:16.283 --> 10:18.701
then straight,

10:16.283 --> 10:18.701
left, right, straight.

10:18.743 --> 10:25.833
No, we went... right... left...

10:25.875 --> 10:27.668
straight...

10:27.710 --> 10:28.753
Oh, man, we're lost!

10:28.795 --> 10:30.046
What?! No!

10:30.088 --> 10:32.299
Oh, man, what are we going

10:30.088 --> 10:32.299
to do?

10:32.340 --> 10:34.968
Nice. We'll get him crying

10:32.340 --> 10:34.968
and then pants him.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.303
No, we really are lost.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.887
What? What are we going to do?!

10:37.929 --> 10:39.931
I knew it.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.931
I knew you were going to find

10:39.973 --> 10:41.516
some way to ruin this

10:39.973 --> 10:41.516
for me.

10:41.558 --> 10:42.683
Even when

10:41.558 --> 10:42.683
you're trying

10:42.725 --> 10:44.561
to be nice,

10:42.725 --> 10:44.561
you make me miserable.

10:44.603 --> 10:48.482
And now, I get to  die

10:44.603 --> 10:48.482
in the sewer.

10:48.523 --> 10:49.774
A perfect end

10:49.816 --> 10:51.109
to a crappy life!

10:51.151 --> 10:52.611
Shut up, Dewey.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.611
All right.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.695
Let's just focus

10:52.652 --> 10:54.695
on finding a way out of here.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.697
Stevie's mom must be worried

10:54.737 --> 10:56.697
about him.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.493
Shut up...

10:56.739 --> 10:59.493
about... my mom!

10:59.534 --> 11:01.536
What? I simply made a comment.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.079
You're... a perv.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.289
I can't help it

11:04.331 --> 11:06.082
if I have a healthy interest

11:04.331 --> 11:06.082
in the opposite sex.

11:06.124 --> 11:09.710
Well... they don't... return...

11:06.124 --> 11:09.710
the favor.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.087
What does that mean?

11:11.129 --> 11:12.964
Girls... hate you.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.382
That's not true.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.300
Yes, it is.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.594
Come on, Reese,

11:15.342 --> 11:17.594
you're a joke.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.597
Yeah, even

11:17.636 --> 11:20.597
I know it.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.728
So, Marty claims

11:25.684 --> 11:27.728
he was at work,

11:27.770 --> 11:29.897
but his boss says

11:27.770 --> 11:29.897
he didn't show up until 6:00.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.108
Now, we've got the attendant

11:29.939 --> 11:32.108
at the gas station

11:32.150 --> 11:34.819
who puts Marty's whereabouts

11:32.150 --> 11:34.819
there between 4:00 and 4:30.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.531
And as we all remember

11:34.861 --> 11:37.531
from the testimony...

11:37.572 --> 11:39.407
Can we vote again?

11:39.449 --> 11:40.534
What's the use?

11:40.575 --> 11:42.410
We've been through this

11:40.575 --> 11:42.410
five times.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.412
We vote guilty,

11:42.452 --> 11:44.412
she votes not guilty.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.414
We vote not guilty,

11:44.454 --> 11:46.414
she votes guilty.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.749
Yeah. So, you go first

11:46.456 --> 11:48.749
this time.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.670
All right. I abstain.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.754
What is it that you want, lady?

11:53.796 --> 11:55.756
I want you to do your job.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.175
I want you to weigh

11:55.798 --> 11:57.175
the facts

11:57.217 --> 11:59.760
of this case

11:57.217 --> 11:59.760
and make a reasoned decision.

11:59.802 --> 12:03.223
You have got the sworn testimony

11:59.802 --> 12:03.223
of the arresting police officer

12:03.264 --> 12:05.058
in which he clearly states...

12:03.264 --> 12:05.058
Yeah,

12:05.099 --> 12:06.560
if you believe

12:05.099 --> 12:06.560
what he says.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.269
Okay. That's fair enough.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.605
It is a question of credibility.

12:10.647 --> 12:11.481
On one hand you have

12:11.523 --> 12:12.773
a 17-year-old

12:11.523 --> 12:12.773
high school dropout

12:12.815 --> 12:14.442
with a history

12:12.815 --> 12:14.442
of reckless behavior.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.569
And on the other,

12:15.610 --> 12:18.029
you have a 20-year veteran

12:15.610 --> 12:18.029
of the police force.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.780
Well, you sure as hell

12:18.071 --> 12:19.780
can't trust the cops.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.616
They're always coming up

12:19.822 --> 12:21.616
with ways to get you.

12:21.658 --> 12:22.576
WOMAN:

12:21.658 --> 12:22.576
That's right.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.494
My neighbor's a cop

12:22.617 --> 12:24.494
and he's got

12:24.536 --> 12:26.454
a 30-foot boat

12:24.536 --> 12:26.454
in his front yard.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.789
Now, how can he

12:26.496 --> 12:28.789
afford a 30-foot boat

12:28.831 --> 12:29.832
on a policeman's salary?

12:29.874 --> 12:32.377
Cops are always getting

12:29.874 --> 12:32.377
away with stuff like that.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.794
(all agreeing)

12:32.419 --> 12:33.794
And start now, I'll tell ya,

12:32.419 --> 12:33.794
when I was a kid...

12:33.836 --> 12:35.714
Stop.

12:35.754 --> 12:39.008
This is not about how you  feel

12:35.754 --> 12:39.008
about cops.

12:39.050 --> 12:42.887
This is not about who you like

12:39.050 --> 12:42.887
and who you hate.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.805
This is about

12:42.929 --> 12:44.805
what you believe happened

12:44.847 --> 12:46.807
based on the facts of the trial.

12:46.849 --> 12:50.520
Did Marty, or did Marty not,

12:46.849 --> 12:50.520
in fact, steal the motorcycle?!

12:50.562 --> 12:52.397
Wait... I thought

12:52.439 --> 12:54.190
Marty was the cop.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.190
WOMAN: Yeah.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.609
MAN:

12:54.232 --> 12:55.609
Yeah, that's what I thought.

12:55.650 --> 12:59.778
Fine.

12:55.650 --> 12:59.778
Let's go through this again.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.073
Yes?

13:02.115 --> 13:03.742
Is it okay to hate you?

13:03.782 --> 13:05.702
Absolutely.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.711
But the money

13:13.042 --> 13:14.711
was really being funneled

13:14.753 --> 13:17.422
to Mr. Reyes' mistress

13:14.753 --> 13:17.422
and their love child.

13:17.464 --> 13:21.718
Once Monahan found out,

13:17.464 --> 13:21.718
it was "Good night, Mr. Reyes."

13:21.760 --> 13:23.844
You've got nothing.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.347
There were witnesses who saw him

13:23.886 --> 13:26.347
argue with the victim.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.890
He can't account

13:26.389 --> 13:27.890
for his whereabouts

13:27.932 --> 13:29.559
when the murder occurred

13:29.601 --> 13:32.437
and they found the murder weapon

13:29.601 --> 13:32.437
in his car.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.022
Means, motive and opportunity.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.066
It's all a little too neat.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.693
Because he's guilty.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.237
My gut says the partner

13:38.735 --> 13:41.237
didn't do it.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.281
Just saying so

13:41.279 --> 13:43.281
doesn't make it so.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.823
Talk to this guy.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.369
You're an idiot.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.873
Oh, my God, that

13:49.621 --> 13:52.873
thing's a monster.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.460
Calm down, I've been

13:52.915 --> 13:55.460
around bears for 40 years.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.044
There's nothing

13:55.502 --> 13:57.044
to worry about.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.171
Really?

13:57.086 --> 13:58.171
Yup.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.548
All we've got to do

13:58.212 --> 14:00.548
is stay real quiet.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.384
Pretty soon he'll get

14:00.590 --> 14:03.384
bored and fly away.

14:03.426 --> 14:06.137
That is unless he's

14:03.426 --> 14:06.137
protecting his eggs.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.597
This is crazy.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.182
We can't stay here.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.809
Somebody's got to make

14:09.223 --> 14:10.809
a run for the truck

14:10.849 --> 14:11.810
and go get help.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.186
That's a suicide mission.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.895
The bear will run down

14:13.227 --> 14:14.895
anyone that goes out there.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.314
Well, what are we

14:14.937 --> 14:16.314
supposed to do?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.107
We can't stay here

14:16.356 --> 14:18.107
and starve to death.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.275
He's right.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.901
I say we try it.

14:20.943 --> 14:21.820
I vote for Eric.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.987
What?!

14:21.861 --> 14:22.987
Go to hell.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.197
I'm not going out there.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.156
You go out there.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.116
Hey, I have a wife at home

14:25.198 --> 14:27.116
to take care of.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.909
Oh, and my life

14:27.158 --> 14:28.909
doesn't mean anything?

14:28.951 --> 14:29.910
How about Artie?

14:29.952 --> 14:30.953
He's the camp outcast.

14:30.995 --> 14:31.954
Big deal.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.707
Pete's just a

14:31.996 --> 14:33.707
toothless old coot.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.500
It's a miracle he's

14:33.748 --> 14:35.500
lived this long.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.085
I should have slit your throat

14:35.542 --> 14:38.085
when I had the chance.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.881
(arguing)

14:43.049 --> 14:44.091
This all looks...

14:44.133 --> 14:45.719
the same.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.928
Yes, this

14:45.760 --> 14:47.928
is the same.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.014
It's all been

14:47.970 --> 14:50.014
exactly the same

14:50.056 --> 14:52.308
ever since the

14:50.056 --> 14:52.308
day I was born.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.934
I start to

14:52.350 --> 14:53.934
trust them.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.395
They make me

14:53.976 --> 14:55.395
regret it.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.771
I get

14:55.436 --> 14:56.771
my hopes up

14:56.813 --> 14:58.939
and then they

14:56.813 --> 14:58.939
destroy them.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.108
Shut up. We get it.

15:01.150 --> 15:05.112
Every girlfriend you ever had

15:01.150 --> 15:05.112
left you crying like a baby.

15:05.154 --> 15:05.946
What?

15:05.988 --> 15:07.948
Oh, who's

15:05.988 --> 15:07.948
Mr. Big Shot, now?

15:07.990 --> 15:09.659
I'm a joke with

15:07.990 --> 15:09.659
the girls, huh?

15:09.701 --> 15:10.951
Well, what's worse--

15:10.993 --> 15:13.120
being a joke, or

15:10.993 --> 15:13.120
being a crybaby?

15:13.162 --> 15:15.582
I wasn't crying

15:13.162 --> 15:15.582
that  hard.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.957
You wet...

15:16.999 --> 15:17.958
your pants.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.960
Oh, like you've ever

15:18.000 --> 15:19.960
even been with a girl.

15:20.002 --> 15:20.961
I have...

15:21.003 --> 15:21.962
a note...

15:22.004 --> 15:23.214
from my doctor.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.799
I could get a doctor

15:23.256 --> 15:24.799
if I wanted to.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.676
That doesn't even

15:24.841 --> 15:26.676
make sense.

15:26.718 --> 15:27.968
DEWEY:

15:26.718 --> 15:27.968
That's right.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.763
Turn on

15:28.010 --> 15:29.763
each other.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.055
Well, you know what?

15:31.097 --> 15:32.599
No girls like

15:32.640 --> 15:33.683
any of you.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.476
And I don't

15:33.725 --> 15:35.476
blame them.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.937
You're all

15:35.518 --> 15:37.937
pathetic.

15:40.690 --> 15:41.982
You know

15:40.690 --> 15:41.982
who's a joke?

15:42.024 --> 15:43.025
Girls.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.025
Yeah.

15:43.067 --> 15:43.984
Why do we even like them?

15:44.026 --> 15:45.278
They make our lives miserable.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.987
You can never understand

15:45.319 --> 15:46.987
what they want.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.865
They're always saying,

15:47.029 --> 15:48.865
"Stop staring at me."

15:48.907 --> 15:49.990
And they don't

15:48.907 --> 15:49.990
laugh at farts.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.242
They only want to

15:50.032 --> 15:51.242
talk about clothes.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.368
They cry...

15:52.410 --> 15:54.621
all the time.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.956
Yeah,

15:54.662 --> 15:56.956
this is helping us get out.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.834
(heavy breathing

15:57.957 --> 15:59.834
approaching)

15:59.876 --> 16:01.419
Time! Time!

15:59.876 --> 16:01.419
Time!

16:01.461 --> 16:02.629
Eleven minutes.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.671
Ha!

16:03.713 --> 16:05.214
In your face!

16:05.256 --> 16:08.927
See, the wife did have time

16:05.256 --> 16:08.927
to run down here from home.

16:08.968 --> 16:14.014
That leaves her two minutes

16:08.968 --> 16:14.014
to stab him, remove the head

16:14.056 --> 16:15.934
and still make it

16:14.056 --> 16:15.934
to the party in time.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.518
It all makes sense.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.270
Oh, and the blood

16:17.560 --> 16:19.270
just magically jumped

16:19.312 --> 16:21.021
from the wife's clothes

16:19.312 --> 16:21.021
to Monahan.

16:21.063 --> 16:24.024
Do you really need this

16:21.063 --> 16:24.024
spelled out for you?

16:24.066 --> 16:25.318
After killing

16:24.066 --> 16:25.318
her husband,

16:25.359 --> 16:27.111
she ran back, took off

16:25.359 --> 16:27.111
the bloody suit

16:27.153 --> 16:29.656
and rubbed it all over

16:27.153 --> 16:29.656
the unconscious Monahan.

16:29.697 --> 16:30.949
Impossible.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.033
You just don't want

16:30.990 --> 16:33.033
to be proven wrong.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.828
I am not wrong.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.037
The knife entered

16:34.869 --> 16:37.037
at a downward angle.

16:37.079 --> 16:40.500
She was 5'2"; he was 6'4".

16:40.541 --> 16:42.126
She'd have had to ask

16:40.541 --> 16:42.126
him to pick her up

16:42.168 --> 16:43.127
so she could stab him.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.671
She could have stood

16:43.169 --> 16:44.671
on something.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.465
Oh, so she brought a stepladder

16:44.712 --> 16:47.465
with her to the alley.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.926
Look, right here

16:47.507 --> 16:49.926
is a milk crate.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.970
She could have hidden

16:49.968 --> 16:51.970
behind the Dumpster,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.054
stood on the milk crate,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.054
pulled out the knife

16:54.096 --> 16:55.348
and stabbed him

16:54.096 --> 16:55.348
several times

16:55.389 --> 16:57.057
with a downward

16:55.389 --> 16:57.057
motion like this.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.519
(woman screaming)

16:59.560 --> 17:01.061
(screams)

17:01.103 --> 17:03.314
(woman continues screaming)

17:04.315 --> 17:06.233
I may be fat, stupid,

17:06.275 --> 17:08.235
colorblind

17:06.275 --> 17:08.235
and dyslexic

17:08.277 --> 17:09.946
but at least I don't

17:08.277 --> 17:09.946
have three nipples.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.072
You shut your trap.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.072
That's a mole.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.115
And  you.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.075
Your family

17:13.157 --> 17:15.075
changed their name

17:15.117 --> 17:16.953
so you couldn't

17:15.117 --> 17:16.953
track them down.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.078
No one will

17:16.995 --> 17:18.078
miss you.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.873
I'm pretty sure

17:18.120 --> 17:19.873
it started with an "O."

17:19.914 --> 17:22.750
All three of you are

17:19.914 --> 17:22.750
useless, pea-brained idiots.

17:22.792 --> 17:23.793
And for your information,

17:23.835 --> 17:25.795
I do suffer more

17:23.835 --> 17:25.795
than everybody else.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.254
This is ridiculous.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.506
Let's just vote on it.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.049
Who votes for Francis?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.385
Who votes for Eric?

17:33.011 --> 17:34.345
Artie?

17:35.013 --> 17:37.015
Pete?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.391
Four votes,

17:37.056 --> 17:38.391
the hut has spoken.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.184
No, you tricked me.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.143
No, no...

17:41.185 --> 17:42.896
He'll reject me.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.146
I've tried me.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.774
I taste awful.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.067
(Pete cackling)

17:51.821 --> 17:53.113
All right,

17:53.155 --> 17:55.783
that's the worst thing

17:53.155 --> 17:55.783
any of us has ever done.

17:55.825 --> 17:56.784
I'm not proud of it,

17:56.826 --> 17:58.619
but I really don't think

17:56.826 --> 17:58.619
we had a choice.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.997
Like I care about your

17:58.661 --> 18:00.997
opinion on anything.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.123
Wait a minute.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.125
Why don't we hear eating?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.126
(engine starts)

18:06.168 --> 18:08.046
He got to the truck.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.630
Pete!

18:09.672 --> 18:14.761
PETE (cackling):

18:09.672 --> 18:14.761
See you back-stabbing

18:09.672 --> 18:14.761
sons of bitches in hell!

18:14.802 --> 18:17.430
So the witness saw Marty

18:14.802 --> 18:17.430
gassing up the motorcycle

18:17.471 --> 18:19.599
a half an hour after the owner

18:17.471 --> 18:19.599
said it went missing.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.601
But doesn't that gas station

18:19.640 --> 18:21.601
close at 5:00?

18:21.642 --> 18:23.019
Not on Fridays.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.145
She pointed that out

18:23.061 --> 18:25.145
in the transcript.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.774
Uh, I think we're ready

18:25.187 --> 18:27.774
for another vote.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.400
Lois?

18:31.193 --> 18:32.570
Go ahead.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.698
By a show of hands, who thinks

18:32.612 --> 18:35.698
the defendant is guilty?

18:36.616 --> 18:37.575
Great.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.159
Let's go tell the judge.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.327
Wait.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.163
I don't think Marty is guilty.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.164
What?

18:44.206 --> 18:45.792
I went through all these papers

18:45.833 --> 18:47.835
and it says the kid sings

18:45.833 --> 18:47.835
in a church choir.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.545
I just don't feel

18:47.877 --> 18:49.545
a churchgoing boy

18:49.587 --> 18:50.838
would do something like this.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.966
That is not fact.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.966
That's bias.

18:53.007 --> 18:56.636
You are basing a decision on

18:53.007 --> 18:56.636
feelings that have nothing to do

18:56.677 --> 18:57.929
with facts.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.014
Facts are things.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.475
Like witnesses seeing

19:00.056 --> 19:02.475
Marty steal the bike.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.393
Like Marty being apprehended

19:02.516 --> 19:04.393
while he was

19:04.435 --> 19:06.186
driving the stolen bike.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.605
Like Marty pulling

19:07.647 --> 19:10.357
tons of stupid stunts

19:07.647 --> 19:10.357
just like this one.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.692
Those are the facts.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.403
I just don't want to send

19:11.734 --> 19:14.403
that poor boy to jail.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.864
Oh, believe me, jail is going

19:14.445 --> 19:16.864
to do a lot more good

19:16.906 --> 19:19.033
than three years

19:16.906 --> 19:19.033
of military school ever did.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.284
Military school?

19:20.326 --> 19:22.411
I didn't read anything

19:20.326 --> 19:22.411
about military school.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.204
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah,

19:22.453 --> 19:24.204
yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.832
I know I saw that somewhere.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.000
I don't think so.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.208
Didn't he drop out

19:27.041 --> 19:28.208
of vocational school?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.503
That's right, after

19:28.250 --> 19:30.503
he transferred from

19:28.250 --> 19:30.503
the private school

19:30.544 --> 19:32.839
where he got caught messing

19:30.544 --> 19:32.839
around with the teacher's aide.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.214
I-I...

19:32.880 --> 19:34.214
You don't understand.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.843
I know for a fact

19:34.256 --> 19:36.843
that Francis went...

19:36.884 --> 19:38.052
Who?

19:39.929 --> 19:41.305
Oh, my God.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.811
I think I have

19:44.142 --> 19:46.811
to excuse myself from this jury.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.270
All in favor.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.609
I'm trying to be

19:51.273 --> 19:53.609
the best me I can be.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.277
But I don't know

19:53.651 --> 19:55.277
what to say to girls

19:55.319 --> 19:56.821
so I just say

19:55.319 --> 19:56.821
something mean.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.865
I guess

19:56.863 --> 19:58.865
I'm afraid of getting hurt

19:58.906 --> 20:00.116
so I hurt them first.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.492
I think my problem is

20:01.534 --> 20:03.870
I get so frustrated

20:01.534 --> 20:03.870
over the things I can't control.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.245
I forget that they're people

20:05.287 --> 20:07.247
with their own will

20:05.287 --> 20:07.247
and their own needs.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.249
I play...

20:09.291 --> 20:10.710
mind games.

20:10.751 --> 20:11.752
It's all...

20:11.794 --> 20:12.962
I have.

20:13.004 --> 20:17.091
Why isn't there ever a

20:13.004 --> 20:17.091
flash flood when you need one?

20:17.133 --> 20:18.258
I really want

20:17.133 --> 20:18.258
a girlfriend.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.969
I want someone

20:18.300 --> 20:19.969
to hang out with.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.261
That's what

20:20.011 --> 20:21.261
I really want.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.263
Yeah, someone you can talk to.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.515
Someone...

20:24.557 --> 20:25.850
to hug.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.351
Someone to show my poetry to.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.936
You write...

20:28.978 --> 20:30.270
poetry?

20:30.312 --> 20:31.981
I dabble.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.274
What to you guys

20:32.023 --> 20:34.274
think about Brenda Pawlak?

20:34.316 --> 20:35.275
She's really nice.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.276
I think she'd

20:35.317 --> 20:36.276
be good for you.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.277
You'd make...

20:37.319 --> 20:38.320
a cute couple.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.280
I thought so, too.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.532
Hey, I know this sounds weird,

20:41.574 --> 20:43.450
but can I read you

20:41.574 --> 20:43.450
something I wrote?

20:43.492 --> 20:45.494
We'd love it.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.249
(screaming)

20:52.001 --> 20:54.420
(screaming continues)

20:56.130 --> 20:57.297
Hey.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.341
(laughing)

20:59.383 --> 21:00.342
Hey.

21:00.384 --> 21:01.468
What happened?

21:01.510 --> 21:03.846
Did you read them

21:01.510 --> 21:03.846
your poetry?

21:08.059 --> 21:10.310
You guys

21:08.059 --> 21:10.310
couldn't even do this right.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.772
I really want to serve

21:11.437 --> 21:12.772
on another jury.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.148
I know, I messed up

21:12.813 --> 21:14.148
this time,

21:14.190 --> 21:15.775
but the next time

21:14.190 --> 21:15.775
I will do it right.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.027
I'm not responsible

21:15.816 --> 21:18.027
for scheduling that.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.737
I'm sure you

21:18.069 --> 21:19.737
have connections.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.697
Please, I just need

21:19.779 --> 21:21.697
another chance.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.365
Seems there was some

21:21.739 --> 21:23.365
kind of mistrial earlier.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.324
Now everything's backed up.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.492
You're going

21:24.366 --> 21:25.492
to have to wait.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.036
I'll do the best I can

21:27.078 --> 21:29.329
if you promise to stop

21:27.078 --> 21:29.329
bothering me right now.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.330
Deal.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.624
I got to go.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.667
My husband's probably

21:31.665 --> 21:33.667
going crazy without me.
