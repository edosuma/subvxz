WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.570
- Previously on Nashville...

00:02.603 --> 00:04.505
- Maybe I had a little fun.
- Then we should do this!

00:04.538 --> 00:06.474
- What are you talking about,
like, a supergroup?

00:06.507 --> 00:08.776
- Or just making music
and having fun.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.544
- Without him up there,
I kind of started to wonder

00:10.578 --> 00:11.712
why I'm doing it.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.447
- The Center for Equine Therapy

00:13.481 --> 00:15.583
that helps troubled teens
deal with trauma.

00:15.616 --> 00:18.186
- There's Jake.
- He is so weird.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.287
- I don't--
- Shut up.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.425
- I was taking some steroids,
but I stopped.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.793
- He's one guy.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.561
He's controlling
everything you feel.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.098
- He is not controlling, he--

00:32.700 --> 00:33.734
- Where do we keep the, uh...

00:33.767 --> 00:35.669
- Right-hand side, next to
your old man vitamins.

00:37.471 --> 00:38.772
- Wait. I didn't know that
Gunnar, Will and Avery

00:38.806 --> 00:39.807
were playing a show tonight.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.509
Will just posted something.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.710
- Yeah. I'm actually going
to see them tonight.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.345
They're over in
East Nashville.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.679
- That's cool.
Are they like a thing now?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.181
- I think they're mostly
screwing around.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.549
But they want me to stop by

00:48.582 --> 00:49.717
to see if there's anything
there, you know.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.419
- Oh, I bet that would be
amazing.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.456
- Uh, Gunnar, Will and Avery
are playing a show tonight.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.458
Dad's going.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.792
- Mm-hmm.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.161
- Don't you got
school tomorrow?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.595
- Yeah.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.097
- Well, Kim Jong crazy guy
could blow us all up

01:03.131 --> 01:04.732
in a nuclear holocaust.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.135
- Someone's been
watching too much CNN.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.402
- No, for real.
Can I?

01:08.436 --> 01:12.573
- Uh, yeah.
Jessie'll be there.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.408
I know she'd love to see you.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.177
- Oh, that's okay.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.546
- Oh, come on now.
Don't do that, please.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.813
We're gonna have fun.
It'll be a good time.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.649
- I forgot.
I have choir practice.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.384
Really?
- I do, yeah.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.652
- Yeah, yeah.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.420
We'll do it another time.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.189
- Okay. That's a promise.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.783
- Hi. My name's Scarlett.

01:55.816 --> 01:56.784
We spoke on
the phone yesterday.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.686
- Oh, yeah, the singer.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.854
- Well, I'm kind of putting
that on hold right now, but...

02:02.823 --> 02:05.326
- I saw the piece they did
on "Good Morning Nashville".

02:05.359 --> 02:07.928
- I hated what they did
to my hair.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.864
- Well, I've been working
with kids lately

02:10.898 --> 02:13.334
and I thought equine
therapy might be

02:13.367 --> 02:14.535
a good fit to help more.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.736
I used to ride
when I was little.

02:15.769 --> 02:16.870
And I really miss it, so...

02:16.904 --> 02:18.706
- Well, we like horse people.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.708
But don't expect to be
getting on one anytime soon.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.344
- Okay.
- Horses are the teachers here.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.379
You'll need some training
to see how it all works.

02:25.413 --> 02:28.816
I recommend you observe a couple
of sessions before committing.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.551
- Of course.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.652
- See if it's something you
really want to get into.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.721
You free at all this week?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.623
- Wide open.
- Terrific.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.191
I'll buddy you up
with one of our regulars

02:37.225 --> 02:38.892
and have her show you the ropes.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.964
- And you'll become much more
familiar with him tomorrow.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.266
- Ugh.
- Eww!

02:45.299 --> 02:47.268
- Right! Lights, please.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.904
Now before I let everyone go,

02:50.938 --> 02:52.640
I need to pair you all
up for the big day.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.476
Yes, I know.
Some of you are dreading it.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.944
But it's gonna be fun,
I promise.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.847
Just think of it as
a rite of passage.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.682
Will those of you in
the odd rows turn around

03:01.715 --> 03:03.351
and look at the person
behind you?

03:04.652 --> 03:06.754
That's your partner in crime.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.656
You'll be graded together
as a team

03:08.689 --> 03:10.224
so you'll need to figure out
who's gonna cut

03:10.258 --> 03:11.825
and who's gonna record data.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.596
Doesn't matter to me.
Just bring your A game, got it?

03:15.629 --> 03:18.332
- Have a good day, everyone.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.470
- Weird.
- Tell me about it.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.505
- So I guess we should
decide who does what?

03:24.538 --> 03:26.640
- Full disclosure,
I'm not that big on

03:26.674 --> 03:30.244
snakes and lizards
or anything slimy.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.912
I was traumatized by
an iguana when I was six.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.847
- Why does that
not surprise me?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.316
- Then there was
that time in

03:35.349 --> 03:37.251
the Galapagos with
the Komodo Dragon.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.354
- I'm kidding.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.824
- Honestly, if I make it
through all this

03:43.857 --> 03:46.294
without puking all over the
place, it's gonna be a miracle.

03:49.497 --> 03:53.501
- * Where do you go when
the night is long, baby *

03:53.534 --> 03:57.371
* Where do you go when
everything is wrong, baby *

03:57.405 --> 04:02.810
* Where do you go when
you're barely hanging on *

04:02.843 --> 04:05.713
* To my arms, my arms

04:13.454 --> 04:17.024
- * It's okay by me *

04:17.057 --> 04:19.427
* If you call tonight

04:21.094 --> 04:23.263
* I'll drop everything *

04:25.098 --> 04:27.401
* Whatever's got you down *

04:27.435 --> 04:30.003
* I can make it all right,
all right *

04:31.805 --> 04:35.809
- * Woo-oo-oo

04:35.843 --> 04:38.746
* Woo-oo-oo

04:38.779 --> 04:41.849
* Ooh yeah

04:47.555 --> 04:49.790
- Oh, okay, I guess.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.427
- Yeah. I don't now.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.796
I mean, you could tell we've
never played together before.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.398
At least the three of us.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.866
- Aw, you just have
to give it time.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.401
- Hey!
This guy wants to manage us.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.336
- He just doesn't know it yet.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.437
See you inside.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.007
- I know it's just
a side project.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.576
But it still needs to be good.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.444
Same thing happened with
ZAG in the beginning.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.712
We never quite figured it out.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.448
- The past is
not your future, babe.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.550
- That's deep.
- Yeah.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.719
It's what Darius says in
this book I'm reading.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.921
He says, "If you want to
be successful in life,

05:20.954 --> 05:22.890
you have to be willing
to change your story."

05:24.024 --> 05:24.992
- Mm-hmm.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.961
- I have to get back
to you on that

05:27.995 --> 05:29.497
because I'm only on page 23.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.432
- You honestly believe
all that stuff?

05:32.866 --> 05:35.436
- Because life's more
complicated than that.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.070
You can't just
wake up one morning

05:37.104 --> 05:38.506
and decide to be someone else.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.140
And why would you want to?

05:40.173 --> 05:43.677
Your story is your story.
It's what makes you, you.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.846
- Yeah, but what if you
don't like who that is?

05:45.879 --> 05:47.548
- You know how much I wanted

05:47.581 --> 05:49.149
to be a pro basketball player
when I was younger?

05:49.182 --> 05:52.553
It was never gonna happen,
no matter how hard I tried.

05:52.586 --> 05:55.122
But if I kept thinking that
I could change it somehow,

05:55.155 --> 05:56.657
I never would
have found music.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.959
- Right, but I'm not
talking about

05:58.992 --> 06:00.728
the things that you
can't change.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.962
I'm talking about the
things that you can change.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.831
Like your outlook on life

06:03.864 --> 06:06.099
or how you feel
about yourself.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.471
- Guys are waiting for me.
I'll be home in a bit.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.174
- Bye.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.843
- Bye.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.059
- Sorry about that.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.595
- No problem.
Just telling these guys

06:34.628 --> 06:35.596
how great we thought
y'all were tonight.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.130
- Mm-hmm.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.433
- You don't feel like there
was a lack of cohesion?

06:39.467 --> 06:41.435
- Yeah.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.903
Just thought we were kind of
all over the place.

06:42.936 --> 06:43.937
- Well, it looked like
y'all were having fun.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.506
Sounded great too.

06:45.539 --> 06:46.807
- Mm-hmm.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.976
- Honestly, I was too busy
trying to decide

06:49.009 --> 06:50.911
which one of you guys
to have a crush on.

06:50.944 --> 06:54.214
It was like every great boy
band concert I've ever been to.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.617
- You've been to
boy band concerts?

06:56.650 --> 06:59.520
- In high school.
Haven't you?

07:01.722 --> 07:03.691
- No, I did not.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.526
- I'm not that gay.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.960
- I plead the Fifth.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.563
- So none of you guys have
seen the Backstreet Boys

07:09.597 --> 07:11.098
in concert or Hanson or...

07:11.131 --> 07:12.733
- No, apparently not.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.101
- They're the entire reason

07:14.134 --> 07:15.836
I'm even in
the music business at all.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.638
- All right, I'm a
little speechless right now.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.707
- I mean, 'N Sync was my
all-time favorite, obviously.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.242
I didn't want to just have
sex with Justin Timberlake.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.178
I wanted to be
Justin Timberlake.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.580
- This just keeps
getting weirder.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.482
- Okay.

07:28.516 --> 07:32.019
I'm just saying that you guys
have that kind of charisma.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.022
- We appreciate
the compliment... I think.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.624
But we're not
really a boy band.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.926
- We're not even boys.
We're old.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.894
Some of us have kids.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.030
- I'm just saying that, if
we're gonna make a go at this,

07:43.063 --> 07:44.832
we should start
focusing on material

07:44.865 --> 07:46.734
that makes sense for
all three of us.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.503
- Yeah. It's a little hard when
our resident crybaby over here

07:49.537 --> 07:51.739
just wants to sing ballads
all the time.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.774
- I believe so.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.676
- First of all, Will,
there's nothing wrong

07:55.709 --> 07:57.578
with a sad country song.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.747
But maybe Avery has a point.

07:59.780 --> 08:00.914
Maybe y'all should
figure out who you are

08:00.948 --> 08:02.149
as a group a little bit,
you know.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.917
Instead of just individuals.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.153
Find some of that, um...

08:06.186 --> 08:08.021
- Cohesion.
- Cohesion.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.223
- Yeah, I guess.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.926
- I might have an opportunity
for you guys to do that.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.928
I happen to know
that Winterville Nashfest

08:14.962 --> 08:16.229
is looking to fill a slot.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.871
- We had an autistic group
in this morning

08:23.904 --> 08:25.673
doing some finger painting.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.975
All nontoxic
and hypoallergenic.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.110
- A life-sized My Little Pony.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.112
- It was like a day
at the spa for the horses.

08:32.145 --> 08:35.148
- I guess I don't know much
about equine therapy at all.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.149
I thought it was
more about riding.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.785
- A lot of folks do.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.620
Truth is, some of the most
effective treatment

08:39.653 --> 08:41.855
comes without ever
getting in a saddle.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.827
- Used to be, but we pretty
much work with everyone now.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.329
Addicts, terminally
ill patients... vets.

08:50.831 --> 08:51.999
- You should see some
of those guys

08:52.032 --> 08:53.734
when they first come
to us, and gals.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.168
How broken they are.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.336
Next thing you know,
they're up and riding

08:56.369 --> 08:58.005
and talking to everyone.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.808
It's transformational.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.042
This here's Scout.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.812
He loves getting
his ears rubbed.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.280
Most of our horses have
been abused or neglected,

09:07.314 --> 09:09.116
so they're healing too.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.819
- What is it that makes them so
suited to this type of work?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.654
- Horses are prey animals.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.988
So their natural
inclination

09:15.022 --> 09:17.324
is to be scared
and protect themselves.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.159
Just like the people
who come to us.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.029
So they end up
recognizing each other

09:22.062 --> 09:24.998
and helping each other
learn to heal and trust.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.667
- Beautiful.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.002
- There's the group
you'll be observing.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.105
One thing I ask is that
you keep your distance,

09:32.139 --> 09:33.874
and don't interfere.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.308
It may look like
fun and games

09:35.342 --> 09:37.310
but it's real work
we're doing here.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.079
- Yes, ma'am.

09:41.081 --> 09:45.385
- Now place the frog on the
dissection tray ventral side up.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.888
- Did I forget to mention
I faint when I see blood?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.859
- It's a genetic thing.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.694
- Thanks for the heads up.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.629
- Now identify
the external structures.

09:55.663 --> 09:58.365
The trunk, the eyes,

09:58.398 --> 10:01.068
the hind limbs and anus.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.706
- Not my cousin.
He was born without one.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.241
- That's funny.
- Not to him.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.178
- Come on now.
Stay focused.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.882
Now secure the frog to the tray
with the four pins provided.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.984
- You're not actually gonna
stick him with that, are you?

10:17.017 --> 10:19.219
- Unless you have a better idea.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.354
- I don't know,
pull the fire alarm?

10:21.388 --> 10:24.157
- You might want to stand back
in case anything squirts out.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.360
- Oh, God.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.364
- Here it comes.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.000
- The explosion of vomit.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.669
We haven't got to
the gross part yet.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.370
- Yeah, and we're not going to.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.379
- So much for passing
Biology this semester.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.215
- We could still catch up
in time if we just hurry.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.150
- Just go.
Save yourself.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.852
Just 'cause I'm gonna fail
doesn't mean you have to.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.954
- We're graded as a team,
remember?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.357
- My dad's gonna kill me.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.228
- Not if I kill you first.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.403
Is your dad tough on you?

11:10.437 --> 11:12.940
- Not according to him,
he's not.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.776
Says I'm gonna get eaten alive
if I don't start trying harder.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.277
Like that theory
we just learned about?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.882
- He says I'm headed
for extinction.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.050
- That's not very nice.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.852
- He's just being a dad.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.453
Aren't they all
pretty much just jerks?

11:28.321 --> 11:31.691
- I mean, mine's a Nazi.
And your's is a rageaholic.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.964
- Isn't that why your
sister went to court?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.732
Because your dad goes
around punching people?

11:38.766 --> 11:40.033
- Shut up!

11:40.067 --> 11:43.436
You don't know anything
about my dad!

11:43.470 --> 11:45.172
- Are you two supposed
to be out here?

12:19.372 --> 12:21.274
- I heard something
on the way over here.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.846
- Crying,
but not normal crying.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.514
It was more intense than that.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.216
Like somebody was dying.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.118
- Interesting way
to describe it.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.955
- A Witnessing.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.489
It's the next phase
in the training,

12:36.523 --> 12:38.892
when you start to free
yourself from your past.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.295
All the unwanted emotions and
traumas associated with it.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.265
Let's focus on
where you are now.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.867
Close your eyes.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.139
I want to go back to that place
you mentioned yesterday.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.344
- From your childhood when
you were the most happy.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.383
Are you there?

13:03.416 --> 13:04.852
- Yeah.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.519
- You were talking
about your uncle.

13:06.553 --> 13:10.223
- Yeah, he's not my real uncle.
My mom just calls him that.

13:11.925 --> 13:15.062
- Old, kind eyes.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.265
What do you see?

13:18.298 --> 13:22.836
- Velvet curtains...

13:22.870 --> 13:24.537
Books everywhere.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.307
A TV with cartoons playing.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.910
It's always the same.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.114
- Nine maybe.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.918
- Yeah.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.553
- A stack of bills.

13:42.289 --> 13:46.860
- $20 bills laid out on
the table like Monopoly money.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.461
- * Don't bother me *

13:48.495 --> 13:49.930
- * Ooh-wop

13:51.965 --> 13:53.266
- * Ooh-wop

13:53.300 --> 13:56.436
- * For all your heartache

13:56.469 --> 14:00.007
* And all your pain

14:00.040 --> 14:01.574
* No, it's too late *

14:01.608 --> 14:03.076
- * Ooh-wop

14:03.110 --> 14:04.611
- * For you and me

14:04.644 --> 14:06.413
- Come on, baby.
Come dance with me.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.548
- * Just go your way

14:08.581 --> 14:09.950
- * Ooh-wop

14:09.983 --> 14:12.953
* Don't bother me *

14:12.986 --> 14:17.524
- * Don't bother me *
- * Ooh-wop

14:20.227 --> 14:21.594
- I need to stop.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.901
- Nothing.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.602
I just don't want
to be there anymore.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.012
- This was a good session.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.248
You should feel really
proud of yourself.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.983
- Didn't feel good to me.

14:43.016 --> 14:46.253
- Is it possible you don't know
what good means anymore?

14:46.286 --> 14:48.421
Things you've been pushing
away for so long

14:48.455 --> 14:52.225
are keeping you from
really feeling who you are.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.101
- Maybe we could rethink
the lyric in that chorus.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.007
- You've heard that
expression before, right?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.341
- Yeah. It's dark, man.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.710
Like the whole chorus
just feels so emo.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.114
Maybe just...
"Can't call you on the phone"?

15:14.147 --> 15:15.315
- "Can't call you
on the phone".

15:15.348 --> 15:16.683
- It scans.
- Yeah, makes it boring.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.285
- Makes it grounded.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.053
- It's not a song
about being grounded.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.388
It's a song about heartbreak.
Heartbreak is dark.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.990
That's why it's
called heartbreak.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.324
- Okay, it's
the last song of the set.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.159
I just thought maybe we
could end on an up note.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.161
- Right, like Waylon Jennings
always ended on an up note.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.529
- Are you gonna
back me up here?

15:29.562 --> 15:31.398
- It's Gunnar's song.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.233
Maybe we should play it
first before we change it.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.468
- I know how it plays.
Like a dirge.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.070
Like all the other downers
he's been writing lately.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.505
- Here we go.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.007
- Come on, man.
He's going through a breakup.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.374
Cut him some slack.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.310
You see me moping
all over the place?

15:43.343 --> 15:45.645
- All right, we can't all wink
and smile our way through life

15:45.678 --> 15:47.214
like we're living
in some fantasy land.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.383
- Whatever. I give up!

15:50.417 --> 15:52.552
- Well, I'm gonna
make a sandwich.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.222
Because being emo
makes me hungry.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.499
Is it just me, or does he
seem extra bright lately?

16:06.533 --> 16:08.035
- Yeah, I know.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.337
- I mean, even his teeth
seem whiter.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.539
- That's just Will.
- No, it's not just Will.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.507
It's like Will times 11.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.243
You see the way he was working
the crowd last night?

16:16.276 --> 16:18.111
It's embarrassing.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.579
- Ah, it's just his act.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.348
- Yeah. That's exactly
what it is.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.150
It's not a very authentic one.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.717
- I don't know,
I pretty much think

16:24.751 --> 16:26.553
what you see is
what you get with Will.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.522
- Yeah. Well, whatever it is,
he better take it down a notch.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.723
It's starting to bug me.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.259
And you know what?

16:32.292 --> 16:33.626
If he hogs the microphone
one more time,

16:33.660 --> 16:36.063
I swear, I'm gonna
strangle him with it!

16:43.603 --> 16:46.273
- Literally for leaving the
classroom without permission.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.108
Can you believe that?

16:48.141 --> 16:52.179
We have to stay after school
and clean all the classrooms.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.746
- I'm so glad
I'm out of that place.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.083
- I was just trying
to be nice to the guy.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.784
I don't know why.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.187
The things he says
sometimes are so weird.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.723
- He called Dad
a rageaholic.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.196
- It's why he said
you went to court

17:09.229 --> 17:11.231
because he went
around punching people.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.632
- That's so not true!

17:12.665 --> 17:15.402
- I know.
Told you he was weird.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.637
And now I have to spend
all this time with him

17:17.670 --> 17:20.073
and it's so awkward.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.315
- Come on, Scout.
Come on, boy, come on.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.583
- The idea is to get the horse
to jump over that pole

17:30.617 --> 17:32.319
without forcing him or
bribing him with treats.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.586
- Come on, Scout.

17:33.620 --> 17:34.754
- It's a lot tougher
than it looks.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.289
- Come on.
Come on, boy.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.790
- Come on...

17:37.824 --> 17:39.626
- To represent the obstacles
the kids have in life.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.262
The roadblocks and the things
we do to get in our own way.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.596
- He won't move.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.797
- You're standing
in front of him.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.299
You think you're coaxing him

17:46.333 --> 17:47.834
but he thinks
you're blocking him.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.437
I'll bet each of you get
scared sometimes when people

17:50.470 --> 17:51.771
you think are standing
in your way.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.607
- Come on, stupid!
- No pushing.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.678
- Communicate.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.447
How do you suppose
Scout's feeling right now?

18:00.480 --> 18:03.150
- Like he doesn't
want to be here.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.184
And neither do I!

18:04.217 --> 18:05.885
- Then let's start there.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.388
Why do you think
he don't want to be here?

18:11.758 --> 18:14.327
No, no, I wasn't laughing at...
I'm smiling.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.463
I can see what a
great job you're doing.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.198
- Okay. Let's give someone
else a try.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.632
- You can't do that.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.204
- The work you're doing out
there is extremely sensitive

18:24.237 --> 18:25.538
and you can't get
in the middle.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.207
- No, ma'am.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.508
I didn't want her
to think I was making fun.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.177
- The stables could use
some mucking out.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.678
Why don't you take
Miss O'Connor down there

18:31.711 --> 18:33.546
and show her how it's done.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.186
- She's getting so big!

18:39.219 --> 18:41.321
- I know, and so impatient.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.523
I swear she's gonna
start potty training herself.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.524
That's my favorite.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.227
- Aw!
- Yeah.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.495
I miss this.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.931
- This. Us.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.600
The way we used to be.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.335
I wish we could go back there.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.770
- Juliette...
- I know, I know.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.506
Like it's all water
under the bridge.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.241
But I do.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.410
I'm not proud of
the way I treated you

19:03.443 --> 19:06.613
and I wish that I could
take it all back.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.381
I hope you know that.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.684
- Yes. I'm really good.

19:11.718 --> 19:15.455
I am.
I've been doing this therapy.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.956
I'm sure Avery told you.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.692
He's been all up in my
Corn Flakes about it.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.728
- He may have mentioned it.
- Mm-hmm.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.330
It's actually
really amazing.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.532
And I know I've been
down this road before

19:25.565 --> 19:29.802
but I'm telling you,
this time it feels real.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.971
- I'm glad.
- Yeah.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.807
You don't think it's weird?

19:34.841 --> 19:38.545
- You know, it's not Jesus.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.980
- Of course not.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.515
I just want you to be happy.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.651
- I am happy.
I'm really happy.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.185
- Good.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.689
- Maybe a little scared, too.

19:51.358 --> 19:55.628
- I can feel myself heading
towards something.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.530
I don't know what it is.

19:57.564 --> 20:01.834
I just... feels like
it's big, though.

20:01.868 --> 20:06.939
And I might have to go through
some pain in order to get there.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.376
Have ever felt that way?

20:09.409 --> 20:12.279
Am I being a big fat
drama queen as usual?

20:13.913 --> 20:15.482
- Once.

20:15.515 --> 20:19.552
Camp Cokachee.
I was there for Bible Camp,

20:19.586 --> 20:22.689
and we were all supposed to get
baptized in the creek one day.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.626
Everyone was so excited
about it except for me.

20:26.659 --> 20:27.894
I was petrified
of having my head

20:27.927 --> 20:29.562
dunked under the water.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.299
I was convinced I was going
to drown in two seconds.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.966
So I pretended I was sick

20:34.000 --> 20:36.436
and I ended up in
the infirmary all afternoon.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.871
And I felt so left out
when they all came back.

20:38.905 --> 20:42.809
Like they'd been through
something, you know?

20:42.842 --> 20:45.778
It took me years to work up
the courage to finally do it.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.416
- I thought I was gonna drown.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.319
But I didn't.

20:52.352 --> 20:55.455
You know, it was such a shame
when you think about it.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.690
All those years
I wasted being afraid.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.334
- He weighs 1,000 pounds

21:07.367 --> 21:09.436
and could trample any
one of us in a heartbeat.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.604
But he's scareder
than you are.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.072
See?

21:13.105 --> 21:15.007
Look how he calms down
when you touch him.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.476
-Mm-hmm.

21:16.509 --> 21:19.312
You wanna give it a try?

21:24.484 --> 21:25.618
- No, that's okay.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.562
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

21:35.595 --> 21:37.397
- I'm running late
for the Bluebird.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.831
So a second will be perfect.
What's up?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.968
- You're not still upset
with me, are you?

21:44.871 --> 21:47.540
- I'm honestly embarrassed
to even bring it back up.

21:47.574 --> 21:48.975
- Come over here.
Sit down.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.477
What are you talking about?

21:52.745 --> 21:54.647
- The hearing.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.882
Just everything
I said on the stand.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.484
- Come on, Mad.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.118
We made our peace with
that a long time ago.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.654
Why you wanna
bring that up?

22:01.688 --> 22:03.956
- Jake Maitland.

22:03.990 --> 22:08.728
He said some really
hurtful things to Daphne today.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.636
- That wasn't horrible.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.407
- You guys sure you
don't wanna go over

22:20.440 --> 22:22.141
this set list one last time?

22:23.776 --> 22:25.144
- I'm just worried about flow.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.980
- Dude, just let it go!

22:29.181 --> 22:30.883
- Stop ranking on my song,

22:30.917 --> 22:32.685
or I'll start ranking on
your new song, all right?

22:32.719 --> 22:34.421
- What's wrong with
my new song?

22:34.454 --> 22:35.855
- Never mind.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.890
- Hey, what's wrong with
the song I just wrote?

22:37.924 --> 22:40.159
- Well, don't ask him.
He's like Switzerland!

22:40.192 --> 22:42.529
- Have you two been trashing
my song behind my back?

22:42.562 --> 22:43.830
- Please stop.

22:43.863 --> 22:44.831
- Well, you should hear
what he says about

22:44.864 --> 22:46.165
your sad sack little ditty.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.900
- Hey, I like his
sad sack little ditty.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.169
- No, I never said that.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.638
He...

22:51.671 --> 22:52.939
Oh, crap. I gotta go.
I'm late.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.607
- What happened to "stirring"

22:54.641 --> 22:56.776
and "deeply emotional"
and the other things?

22:56.809 --> 22:57.777
- It is stirring.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.011
- Just not as stirring as

22:59.045 --> 23:00.647
Mr. Bump and Grind It
last night?

23:00.680 --> 23:01.948
- Well, you know,
someone had to wake them up

23:01.981 --> 23:03.015
out of their coma!

23:03.049 --> 23:04.817
- Enough!

23:04.851 --> 23:06.553
You know what?
The truth is,

23:06.586 --> 23:08.821
you could both use a little bit
of each other right now.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.089
And you're a
little depressing.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.592
And you're a little
Rico Suave.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.761
It's like that commercial
when we were little

23:14.794 --> 23:15.762
where the guy's walking
down the street

23:15.795 --> 23:17.597
with a jar of peanut butter.

23:17.630 --> 23:18.965
and accidentally bumps into
a girl eating some chocolate?

23:18.998 --> 23:20.467
Next thing you know,

23:20.500 --> 23:22.735
they revolutionize
the candy bar industry.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.205
- You need a little
of his chocolate.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.407
And you need a little
of his peanut butter.

23:48.160 --> 23:52.565
- * Wandering roads
that carry me home *

23:54.867 --> 23:59.105
* Lead me through
both right and wrong *

24:01.908 --> 24:05.077
* I may love
and I may lose *

24:05.111 --> 24:09.248
* Still I know
I'll always choose *

24:09.281 --> 24:13.152
* To live the highs and lows

24:15.855 --> 24:19.792
* All on my journey home

24:21.961 --> 24:26.465
* Since the day that
you were born *

24:28.668 --> 24:32.839
* Footsteps fall
in a path well-worn *

24:35.307 --> 24:38.811
* Strings that pull,
you never see *

24:38.845 --> 24:43.049
* Chains that bind you
set you free *

24:43.082 --> 24:47.253
* All on your journey home

24:49.255 --> 24:53.826
- * Wandering roads
that carry me home *

24:55.895 --> 25:00.132
* Lead me through
both right and wrong *

25:02.234 --> 25:05.605
* I may love and I may lose

25:05.638 --> 25:10.076
* Still I know
I'll always choose *

25:10.109 --> 25:14.847
* To live the highs
and lows *

25:16.716 --> 25:21.287
* All on my journey home

25:24.023 --> 25:33.933
- * Ooh

25:36.636 --> 25:38.938
- It's like every day,
another door opens.

25:38.971 --> 25:42.174
All these discoveries,
it's pretty mind-blowing.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.176
- Sounds like it.
- Yeah.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.613
And terrifying, too,
at the same time.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.180
- Well, it goes with
the territory, right?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.351
- Here you go, babe.
- Thank you.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.820
- Mm-hmm.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.355
- I'm gonna go say
hi to Hallie.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.892
- Okay.

25:59.926 --> 26:00.927
Hey, thanks for coming.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.895
- Yeah. Just sorry I was late.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.363
You guys all ready for tomorrow?

26:04.396 --> 26:06.899
- I think I may have created
a two-headed monster.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.668
Will and Gunnar?

26:08.701 --> 26:10.603
- Yeah. Maybe it's just better
if we all shut up

26:10.637 --> 26:13.372
and let each other
do what we do.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.207
- Want me to maybe stop
by the soundcheck?

26:15.241 --> 26:16.375
Give a little
pep talk to Bucky?

26:16.408 --> 26:18.044
- Couldn't hurt.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.012
- All right.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.951
- Yeah.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.088
- Pretty great,
considering where she was.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.857
I mean, why?
You don't think so?

26:30.890 --> 26:33.693
- It's just this guru guy
she's all wrapped up in.

26:33.726 --> 26:36.929
I've never seen her surrender
to anything so quickly.

26:36.963 --> 26:39.231
It's kind of spooky.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.400
- I've seen that
happen sometimes.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.035
You know, people, they feel
something helping them

26:43.069 --> 26:44.336
so they get
this shot of adrenalin.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.105
You know, the first steps
of healing.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.674
Ask anybody that's
ever been to AA.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.677
- This feels different.
It scares me a little.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.347
- I knew this kid
in high school.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.250
Got involved in a cult.
Gave up everything.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.721
A football scholarship,
his girlfriend, his name even.

27:01.754 --> 27:04.190
His parents spent
a fortune tracking him down,

27:04.223 --> 27:07.059
trying to undo everything
that was done to him.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.162
He was never
the same after that.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.198
It's like they forgot
to put something back

27:12.231 --> 27:15.134
after they returned him.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.703
- Well, you think
this is like that?

27:16.736 --> 27:18.304
- I don't know.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.172
- It seems like
she's come a long way.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.141
I don't know, Avery.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.342
I mean, if she's
finding something

27:23.375 --> 27:24.977
from this guy,
it might be hard.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.078
But you might need
to let her go down this road

27:26.112 --> 27:28.014
a little longer.
- Yeah, maybe.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.682
- I am serious.
I see this all the time.

27:29.716 --> 27:30.950
People start out real gung-ho.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.285
But, you know,
the novelty wears off.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.821
They come back to earth.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.989
Real healing starts in.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.726
Maybe just give her
a little more time.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.328
- Yeah.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.210
- A rageaholic.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.747
- Nope.

28:00.780 --> 28:03.249
Pretty sure
that's a direct quote.

28:03.282 --> 28:04.951
- I'm so sorry.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.886
- No, no, no.
That's not why I'm calling.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.054
- You know, there's
only one person

28:08.087 --> 28:09.221
that he could have
heard that from.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.823
- Yeah.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.392
Listen, Jessie,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.796
I've had more than my share
of moments I'm not proud of.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.230
But that was all back
when I was drinking.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.732
- Deacon, stop.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.400
You do not need to
defend yourself, please.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.002
- I know.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.436
There's just not too many
folks right now

28:24.470 --> 28:26.305
that I feel the need
to take a swing at and...

28:26.338 --> 28:27.940
- Deacon, stop.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.075
- No, I've been--

28:30.242 --> 28:32.011
I just want you
to know, okay?

28:32.044 --> 28:33.312
I want you to know that
you don't have to worry.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.748
I'm a good guy.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.449
No matter what the rumors are.

28:37.483 --> 28:41.287
- Well, first of all, I don't
pay any attention to that crap.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.089
- I know.
- It's not my style.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.323
And let's not forget
that there is

28:44.356 --> 28:46.258
a whole lot of garbage
out there on me.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.459
So you really don't need
to worry about.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.328
I can make up my own mind.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.164
And I'm a pretty
good judge of character.

28:52.198 --> 28:55.134
My ex-husband notwithstanding,
obviously.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.804
- Yeah. Well...

28:57.837 --> 28:59.538
I just wanted to clear
the air a little, that's all.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.840
- All right.
Well, are we done?

29:01.874 --> 29:03.109
- Yeah, we're done.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.777
- Good, because there's
this restaurant

29:04.811 --> 29:06.879
I want to take you to after
we see the guys tonight.

29:06.913 --> 29:08.280
- Yeah.

29:08.314 --> 29:11.283
I found the only place
in all of Nashville

29:11.317 --> 29:12.852
that doesn't serve
Brussels sprouts.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.956
- Oh, thank God.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.430
- He asked me to get you.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.037
- Your Witnessing.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.350
- One second.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.518
These two are having
some trouble bonding.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.321
It's a great way to help
them start communicating.

29:52.024 --> 29:54.193
One of the first things
I learned when I started riding.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.528
- Aren't you supposed
to be mucking out stalls?

29:56.562 --> 29:58.931
- Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.399
I don't mind doing it.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.201
I've mucked out plenty
of stables in my life.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.936
I'll keep going
if you want me to.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.538
It's not really
helping anybody

30:06.572 --> 30:09.341
and that's what
I came here to do.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.843
Or least try
to learn how to do.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.611
- I know.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.181
- The safest place I've ever
felt is by a horse's side.

30:15.214 --> 30:18.084
I thought maybe if
I came here,

30:18.117 --> 30:20.219
I could learn how to communicate
that to other people.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.354
And make myself useful.

30:22.388 --> 30:23.522
I certainly didn't mean
to get under your feet.

30:23.555 --> 30:24.523
- Hold on.

30:26.558 --> 30:29.361
I'm sensing a meltdown
about to happen.

30:31.397 --> 30:32.531
- You're so close.

30:32.564 --> 30:34.200
- He doesn't like me!

30:34.233 --> 30:35.968
- He likes you fine.
You just need to trust that.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.938
- No. I want to go home.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.044
I want to go home.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.124
- We're all here for
you, Juliette.

31:32.158 --> 31:36.095
We all know what it's like
to be stuck in the past.

31:36.128 --> 31:38.097
Unable to break free.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.498
Let us help you.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.267
I know you want that.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.935
Am I right?

31:42.969 --> 31:45.671
- Yes.

31:45.704 --> 31:49.041
- I want to go back to
the place you were yesterday.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.676
Can you see it?

31:50.709 --> 31:53.479
- I don't know why we have
to keep going back there.

31:53.512 --> 31:56.282
- Because too much of you
still lives there.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.985
It was something
you described.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.487
A stack of bills laid out
like Monopoly money.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.956
You see it?

32:03.990 --> 32:05.124
- Mm-hmm.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.626
- And the man you
called "uncle"?

32:07.659 --> 32:09.328
Where is he?

32:09.361 --> 32:11.263
- He's not here anymore.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.666
- He's in the bedroom.

32:16.335 --> 32:17.936
Is she in the bedroom?

32:19.538 --> 32:21.040
- No.

32:26.178 --> 32:29.581
- No, please!

32:29.615 --> 32:31.717
No!

32:31.750 --> 32:33.986
- I am.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.254
No.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.390
No, please!

32:38.424 --> 32:40.026
Stop!

32:40.059 --> 32:42.094
Mom, where are you?

32:42.128 --> 32:44.363
Mom! Mommy!

32:48.300 --> 32:50.236
- Juliette, it's okay.

32:50.269 --> 32:54.706
You're safe. You're safe.
You're safe.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.475
You're all right.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.722
- I think I just need to sit
here for a few more minutes.

33:12.058 --> 33:14.060
- You just changed your life.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.762
You have all the time
in the world.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.435
- Check, check, check.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.637
- One, two, check.
- Check.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.307
Hey, guys, you think I should
make my vocal any brighter?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.142
I mean, not too bright.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.477
You know,
I wouldn't sound happy.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.646
- Don't look at me.
I'm fragile.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.715
- Hey, y'all.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.318
- Hey. What brings
you guys out here?

33:39.351 --> 33:41.087
- We come to see our favorite
new band, that's all.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.388
- Before you guys break up.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.290
- We just wanna see
if we can help you

33:44.323 --> 33:47.293
find a way to see
if this can be something.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.694
- I'm not sure
it can be something.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.197
I might be allergic
to chocolate.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.333
- Never mind.
Bad analogy.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.667
- We thought
we could make it work,

33:55.701 --> 33:58.470
but maybe our styles
are just too different.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.572
- Isn't there some way you guys
can just chill out and relax?

34:02.308 --> 34:04.276
- Seriously, guys.
Can't you have a little fun?

34:04.310 --> 34:06.078
That's why you started this band
in the first place, right?

34:06.112 --> 34:08.647
I mean, y'all are
friends, right?

34:08.680 --> 34:11.850
Fellas, I don't know what
Jessie was talking about really.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.186
I don't know 'N Sync or
boy bands and all that.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.754
But I do know bands.

34:15.787 --> 34:17.656
I've been in a bunch.
I've seen 'em all.

34:17.689 --> 34:20.526
You don't have to be the same
guy in this band, all right?

34:20.559 --> 34:22.328
Look at the Rolling Stones.

34:22.361 --> 34:24.163
You got Mick up there
being energetic

34:24.196 --> 34:27.199
and charismatic and sexy.

34:27.233 --> 34:30.836
Keith, dark and broody
and a little dangerous.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.404
It just works, you know,
and that's how...

34:33.805 --> 34:35.307
I'm sorry,
I gotta take this.

34:35.341 --> 34:38.477
One more thing.
Have fun.

34:38.510 --> 34:41.447
One thing about them boy bands,
everybody's smiling.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.215
There ain't a damn thing
wrong with that.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.689
- Can you pass me
the toxic chemical, please?

34:56.195 --> 34:57.329
All right.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.667
So are we not
talking anymore or...

35:01.700 --> 35:03.469
- Works for me.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.237
- I'm the one
that should be mad.

35:05.271 --> 35:06.672
If you didn't freak out
over that stupid little frog,

35:06.705 --> 35:08.340
we wouldn't even be here
in the first place.

35:08.374 --> 35:09.675
- What difference
does that make?

35:09.708 --> 35:11.143
We shouldn't even know
each other.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.578
- You think I want
to be your friend?

35:12.611 --> 35:14.380
- I barely even knew your
name before any of this.

35:14.413 --> 35:15.814
- Okay, and all I knew about
you is that you were weird.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.549
- Well, at least you noticed me.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.551
- So I am one of those stupid
people you look down on.

35:19.585 --> 35:20.919
- I didn't say you were stupid.

35:22.621 --> 35:23.655
- I just don't understand
why you had to go

35:23.689 --> 35:24.823
running to your daddy.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.194
- You told your dad
what I said about him.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.895
- No. Actually, I didn't.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.531
Well then, how did
my mom find out?

35:32.564 --> 35:33.799
- The only person...

35:36.402 --> 35:37.869
I told my sister.

35:40.539 --> 35:44.510
- Well, you can thank her.
Now my mom is pissed.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.245
I've got no cell phone
for two weeks.

35:46.278 --> 35:47.946
- God, I'm gonna kill her.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.516
- And I have
to apologize in person

35:50.549 --> 35:52.284
which I have no idea
how I'm supposed to do.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.221
- That's a little bit harsh.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.523
- Tell me about it.

35:57.556 --> 35:58.690
- My dad might hit you.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.927
- Yeah, he probably will.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.795
- It's exactly what you need.

36:05.264 --> 36:07.799
- Make a man outta you.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.936
- I'm just pissed
I can't blame you

36:10.969 --> 36:11.970
for those two being together.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.505
- Oh, come on.

36:13.539 --> 36:14.640
You were playing matchmaker
the whole time.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.975
- Yeah, it sucks.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.977
- You don't have
to talk to me.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.979
- Thank God.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.848
- I said don't talk to me.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.448
- Whoa, whoa.
It's okay.

36:56.482 --> 36:57.949
It's okay, sweetheart.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.918
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.255
It's okay.

37:04.490 --> 37:07.459
Come on, sweetheart, come on.

37:07.493 --> 37:08.960
I didn't want you
to get squished.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.262
- Thanks.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.366
- Come on.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.335
Good girl.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.273
- I am now.

37:21.307 --> 37:23.842
- Why don't you head on up to
the corral and join the others?

37:26.077 --> 37:27.713
- Sorry.
- You did the right thing.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.749
- When safety is
involved, absolutely.

37:32.418 --> 37:33.785
That's my nephew.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.454
He's staying with us
for a while.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.425
What the heck
have you done in here?

37:39.458 --> 37:41.327
- I cleaned.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.962
- It hasn't been this spotless
since Reagan was president.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.533
- I have slight OCD.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.501
- Maybe you need
some equine therapy.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.473
Care to go for a ride?

37:56.608 --> 37:57.543
- Yes, ma'am.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.359
- Nope.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.561
- This next one is
for the fangirls.

38:23.502 --> 38:27.473
- * It's tearing up
my heart when I'm with you *

38:27.506 --> 38:28.940
* But when we are apart,
I feel it too *

38:28.974 --> 38:31.377
- Oh my God!

38:31.410 --> 38:35.547
* And no matter what I do

38:35.581 --> 38:39.017
* I feel the pain

38:39.050 --> 38:41.420
* With or without you

38:48.960 --> 38:53.965
- * Baby, I don't understand *

38:53.999 --> 38:57.569
- * Just why
we can't be lovers *

38:57.603 --> 39:02.941
* Things are getting
out of hand *

39:02.974 --> 39:05.811
* Trying too much,
but, baby *

39:05.844 --> 39:08.680
* We can't win *

39:08.714 --> 39:10.749
- * Let it go

39:10.782 --> 39:13.018
* If you want me, girl...

40:15.681 --> 40:18.850
- She used to take me to my
favorite restaurant afterwards.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.787
Let me order
whatever I wanted.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.589
- I'm so sorry.

40:23.622 --> 40:25.023
- I'm not surprised.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.124
This is a woman
who murdered someone

40:26.157 --> 40:28.126
and then killed herself.

40:28.159 --> 40:31.530
It's not like it's Snow White
we're talking about here.

40:31.563 --> 40:36.034
- You have every right
to the rage and betrayal

40:36.067 --> 40:37.669
you're feeling right now.

40:37.703 --> 40:40.138
- She robbed me of everything.

40:42.007 --> 40:45.176
My childhood, my innocence.

40:47.245 --> 40:51.517
She just keeps on taking even
from beyond the grave.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.819
- It's profoundly disturbing,

40:53.852 --> 40:56.822
the pain we endure
from the ones we love most.

40:56.855 --> 41:01.727
How we recreate that
dynamic over and over again

41:01.760 --> 41:04.262
in our most intimate
relationships

41:04.295 --> 41:08.500
and come to think
of that as love.

41:12.137 --> 41:15.841
This is your first step
toward breaking that cycle

41:15.874 --> 41:20.245
and erasing this notion of
yourself that you've always had.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.814
I hope you can see that now.

41:24.149 --> 41:27.185
- You deserve to be loved.

41:27.218 --> 41:30.856
You deserve to be happy.

41:33.058 --> 41:35.126
- I know that may seem
like a foreign concept.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.229
But in time,
you'll know what it means.

41:42.701 --> 41:45.103
Will it ever
completely go away?

41:45.136 --> 41:48.139
- I can't promise you that.

41:48.173 --> 41:52.143
But I can promise, if you
stick with the training,

41:52.177 --> 41:54.546
you won't be the same person
when you're through.
