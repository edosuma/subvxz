WEBVTT

00:04.444 --> 00:05.243
Here's what I'm thinking.

00:05.279 --> 00:07.212
This Saturday, sister time,

00:07.247 --> 00:10.448
Harvard Square. Food, fun,
that shoe store that you love.

00:10.484 --> 00:13.618
- Stop. I know when I'm being played.
- What...

00:13.654 --> 00:16.588
Spin Mom and Dad as much as I
do, you get a real ear for it.

00:16.623 --> 00:19.524
It's like learning a different
language, except way more useful.

00:21.662 --> 00:24.229
Wow, I call you out and you throw a fit.

00:24.264 --> 00:27.532
Classic diva reality TV move. I like it.

00:27.567 --> 00:30.235
No. I'm showing you my latest invention.

00:30.270 --> 00:32.404
Presenting...

00:34.441 --> 00:35.473
The Floor Finder.

00:35.509 --> 00:37.475
In any family with kids,

00:37.511 --> 00:38.643
there's always
a ton of stuff on the floor.

00:38.679 --> 00:41.246
Picking it all up is endless.

00:41.281 --> 00:42.514
This makes it easy, and fun.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.258 --> 00:52.657
See? I call it the Floor Finder

00:52.693 --> 00:54.559
because it finds the floor.

00:54.594 --> 00:57.262
I'm not driving you to Boston
so you can suck bulky trash

00:57.297 --> 00:59.364
off Harvard Square.

00:59.399 --> 01:02.400
No. You know that super rich
investor guy, Troy Havana?

01:02.436 --> 01:04.302
He's gonna be there.

01:04.337 --> 01:05.470
If I can show him the Floor Finder,

01:05.504 --> 01:07.339
this thing could go national.

01:07.374 --> 01:10.408
I can think of 20 things
I'd rather do than drive you.

01:10.444 --> 01:12.310
Oh, just thought of another 20.

01:12.346 --> 01:14.312
Okay then.

01:14.348 --> 01:15.447
I'm going to have to use this.

01:16.483 --> 01:19.217
- No!
- Wanna see that again?

01:19.252 --> 01:21.252
RACHEL: No!

01:21.288 --> 01:23.288
Still not seeing anything, are you?

01:23.323 --> 01:24.522
I just played a Diaz card.

01:24.558 --> 01:26.224
It might be made out of thin air,

01:26.259 --> 01:27.459
but in this family,

01:27.494 --> 01:29.561
that's as good as written in stone.

01:29.596 --> 01:31.296
It guarantees the holder one favor,

01:31.331 --> 01:32.630
with no right of refusal.

01:32.666 --> 01:34.466
I got this one six months ago.

01:36.636 --> 01:39.237
I see you sneaking out.

01:39.272 --> 01:41.573
Or do I?

01:43.310 --> 01:45.443
We're going to have to get
an early start on Saturday.

01:45.468 --> 01:46.891
- 8:00 a.m.
- Noon?

01:46.915 --> 01:48.915
8:00 a.m. it is.

01:49.316 --> 01:52.217
I had that six months. I'm using it.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.453
I didn't love having
to give up a Diaz card,

01:55.489 --> 01:57.622
but it's worth it,

01:57.657 --> 02:00.191
because once Troy Havana
sees my invention...

02:06.466 --> 02:07.925
(thunk)

02:07.950 --> 02:09.916
Oops. That was a gold brick.

03:06.359 --> 03:08.393
Look what I dug out of the hall closet.

03:08.428 --> 03:10.261
You went into the hall closet?

03:10.297 --> 03:11.329
Are you okay?

03:11.364 --> 03:12.564
More than okay.

03:12.599 --> 03:14.566
With Mom and Georgie at the tournament,

03:14.601 --> 03:16.634
and Rachel driving
Miss Daphne to dance class,

03:16.670 --> 03:18.603
for the first time in eight years,

03:18.638 --> 03:21.372
I am free to go golfing with my buddies.

03:21.408 --> 03:22.540
Don't look at me like that.
I have buddies.

03:22.576 --> 03:24.576
I hate to do this,

03:24.611 --> 03:26.511
but I'm afraid Rachel
will be driving Miss Harley

03:26.546 --> 03:28.513
to Harvard Square.

03:28.548 --> 03:31.516
When did I give you a Diaz card?

03:37.424 --> 03:39.257
No, hon, I just checked.

03:39.292 --> 03:41.593
It's definitely your turn
to take the kids to the dentist.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.500
I don't make the rules.
I just live by them.

03:48.535 --> 03:51.503
I guess golf can wait
another eight years.

03:51.538 --> 03:54.239
And for the record,
I really do have buddies.

03:56.309 --> 03:57.642
So this kid, A.J. Borrello,

03:57.677 --> 04:00.211
had the nerve to give a report called

04:00.247 --> 04:02.447
"One hundred things
you can do with jelly."

04:02.482 --> 04:04.182
Can you believe?

04:04.217 --> 04:05.483
I can't believe I haven't learned

04:05.519 --> 04:07.452
not to ask how your day was.

04:07.487 --> 04:10.288
Last week, when A.J. said
mustard was better than mayo,

04:10.323 --> 04:12.323
we let it slide.

04:12.359 --> 04:14.425
But this... this is too much.

04:14.461 --> 04:16.461
Why should jelly be celebrated

04:16.495 --> 04:19.264
when peanut butter isn't
getting the respect it deserves?

04:19.298 --> 04:21.533
Peanut butter
is the hero of that sandwich.

04:21.567 --> 04:23.501
Jelly's just the sidekick.

04:23.537 --> 04:26.371
Yeah, they don't call it jelly
and peanut butter, do they?

04:26.406 --> 04:28.339
Sounds like A.J. Borrello might.

04:28.375 --> 04:31.376
Not for long. We're
doing our own report.

04:31.411 --> 04:35.346
"One hundred and one things
you can do with peanut butter."

04:35.382 --> 04:38.483
You want in on PB-no-J?

04:38.518 --> 04:41.219
No, I do not need to be on a team

04:41.254 --> 04:43.221
that's mostly known for sticking
to the roof of your mouth.

04:43.256 --> 04:45.490
Say what you want about us,

04:45.525 --> 04:49.494
but we will not have you disrespecting
our friend peanut butter.

04:49.529 --> 04:51.563
Oh, that goes on our list.

04:51.598 --> 04:55.500
Friend. One down, 100 to go.

05:02.609 --> 05:06.177
I thought you had an appointment
at Troy Havana's office,

05:06.213 --> 05:08.246
not a lame meet-and-greet
at some food truck.

05:08.281 --> 05:10.315
This isn't just any food truck.

05:10.350 --> 05:12.317
Pizza in a cone is the hottest craze

05:12.352 --> 05:14.319
since the last idea
somebody brought Troy...

05:14.354 --> 05:15.553
hats for cats.

05:15.589 --> 05:17.422
Who would eat pizza in a cone?

05:17.457 --> 05:20.558
It's basically a funnel
for sauce to land on your pants.

05:20.594 --> 05:22.360
Line's moving.

05:30.570 --> 05:32.437
Sorry.

05:32.472 --> 05:35.340
You're mad now, but you're
going to want one of these.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.275
Floor Finder.

05:37.310 --> 05:41.212
Look for it on The Shopping
Channel in about a month.

05:41.248 --> 05:43.281
Hey, friends!

05:43.316 --> 05:44.449
Thanks for coming.

05:44.484 --> 05:46.551
That's him. That's Troy Havana.

05:46.586 --> 05:49.187
Quick, make this look
like your living room.

05:49.222 --> 05:52.223
Sorry, got to run.
Big meeting across town.

05:52.259 --> 05:54.626
I know you were all hoping for a photo,

05:54.661 --> 05:58.296
but don't worry, I won't let you down.

05:58.331 --> 06:01.332
Mr. Havana, wait! I wanna show you...

06:10.377 --> 06:12.143
Here you go.

06:12.178 --> 06:13.544
Oh, uh...

06:13.580 --> 06:16.347
and here's a yo-yo for your trouble.

06:16.383 --> 06:18.283
That Troy guy is a real jerk.

06:18.318 --> 06:20.551
How can he leave after two minutes?

06:20.587 --> 06:23.321
He did get all these people
to show up at his store.

06:24.424 --> 06:27.225
Sometimes people in business
don't play nice.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.294
Like Troy Havana always says,

06:29.329 --> 06:31.362
"It's called business, not bus-nice."

06:31.398 --> 06:33.364
Ugh, just suck me up in that
thing and let this be over.

06:37.203 --> 06:39.637
Well, it's not the freshest
use for peanut butter,

06:39.673 --> 06:41.572
but it is a classic.

06:41.608 --> 06:43.441
Make sandwich.

06:43.476 --> 06:47.211
Now we just have 99 uses to go.

06:47.247 --> 06:50.581
Rachel uses avocado for her face mask.

06:53.653 --> 06:56.254
- How does your face feel?
- Chunky.

06:57.424 --> 07:00.458
Peanut butter does make you look dumb.

07:00.493 --> 07:02.226
Didn't think of that one.

07:02.262 --> 07:04.362
Rachel uses cucumbers on her eyes.

07:04.397 --> 07:07.465
Maybe we should use crackers.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.434
I wonder what else crackers can do.

07:09.469 --> 07:11.235
One list at a time.

07:12.572 --> 07:16.374
Why is there peanut butter
all over the doorknob?

07:16.409 --> 07:18.476
Well, you don't hear it
squeak anymore, do you?

07:18.511 --> 07:21.379
Right, and this is so much less annoying

07:21.414 --> 07:23.214
than a squeaky doorknob.

07:23.249 --> 07:25.350
You know, I really wish peanut butter

07:25.385 --> 07:27.618
could get rid of complaining.

07:29.522 --> 07:32.223
- All this work is making me hungry.
- Me, too.

07:40.367 --> 07:42.500
There's gotta be another
way to get to Troy Havana.

07:42.535 --> 07:44.602
Oh, good. I was afraid I was
gonna have to go three minutes

07:44.637 --> 07:46.604
without hearing that name.

07:46.639 --> 07:50.274
Hm. He's going to be on
<i>Dancing With My Dad.</i>

07:50.310 --> 07:51.509
(gasps)

07:51.544 --> 07:53.344
I love that show.

07:53.380 --> 07:54.512
Seems a little beneath him.

07:54.547 --> 07:56.381
The man put hats on cats.

07:56.416 --> 07:58.349
They're doing a special
where celebrities dance

07:58.385 --> 07:59.650
against regular people.

07:59.686 --> 08:02.120
It's called "Pros Versus Schmoes."

08:02.155 --> 08:04.288
And it's filming in Boston.

08:04.324 --> 08:06.324
You're driving me to Boston.

08:06.359 --> 08:08.326
- You don't have a card to play.
- Yeah, I know.

08:08.361 --> 08:10.261
But you love the show.

08:10.296 --> 08:12.363
I figured if I sold the
slap, you'd let it go.

08:12.399 --> 08:14.499
You're right, I'm in.

08:14.534 --> 08:17.535
But because you think you know me
so well, I'm thinking of going out.

08:17.570 --> 08:22.173
But after strong consideration,
you'll still stay in.

08:22.208 --> 08:23.474
When you know me, you know me.

08:29.215 --> 08:31.382
Guess who had fun at dance class.

08:31.418 --> 08:35.586
Dad brought the heat so hard,
we got to stand in front.

08:35.621 --> 08:38.289
From now on, I'm telling Mom
class is cancelled

08:38.323 --> 08:40.258
so Fancy Feet can take me.

08:41.494 --> 08:43.461
I don't believe in signs,

08:43.496 --> 08:46.364
but Daphne just walked in
literally dancing with my dad.

08:46.399 --> 08:49.233
That's not a sign; that's a billboard.

08:50.603 --> 08:52.437
Your mother signed up
for the parent dance

08:52.472 --> 08:54.405
at the next recital,
so I had to fill in.

08:54.441 --> 08:57.241
You guys need to share
this talent with the world.

08:57.277 --> 08:59.210
<i>Dancing With My Dad</i>
is doing a show in Boston.

09:00.547 --> 09:02.180
Open auditions are tomorrow.

09:02.215 --> 09:05.416
Done. My face was made for TV.

09:05.452 --> 09:07.351
I'm gonna go tell Deathnee.

09:07.387 --> 09:09.353
Let's take it back a sec.

09:09.389 --> 09:11.522
Me dancing on TV? Sorry, no.

09:11.558 --> 09:14.192
Come on, you'd be great.

09:14.227 --> 09:16.127
And then I could show
my invention to Troy Havana.

09:16.162 --> 09:17.295
He's already on the show.

09:17.330 --> 09:19.464
You shouldn't bother celebrities.

09:19.499 --> 09:22.433
Your football hero
Brady Rice is also on the show.

09:22.469 --> 09:24.268
Brady Rice?

09:24.304 --> 09:27.238
The man who caught
17 touchdowns his rookie year?

09:27.273 --> 09:30.141
The reason I wanted to name the twins
Brady and Rice, that Brady Rice?

09:30.176 --> 09:32.443
- Yeah, too bad...
- I'll do it.

09:32.479 --> 09:34.479
And I won't ask him to sign more
than two things; that would be rude.

09:34.514 --> 09:37.448
Maybe four things. You know what,
let's not put a cap on it.

09:37.484 --> 09:39.217
I might be on TV.

09:39.252 --> 09:41.319
You're not dancing, they are.

09:41.354 --> 09:44.322
Yeah, but they always show the
family of the dancers performing.

09:44.357 --> 09:46.591
And I have amazing watching faces.

09:46.626 --> 09:48.159
Concerned.

09:48.194 --> 09:49.360
Relieved.

09:49.395 --> 09:50.595
"We won" face!

09:50.630 --> 09:52.396
So good. We better be using that one.

09:54.534 --> 09:57.168
I don't know what my face
is going to be doing,

09:57.203 --> 09:59.270
but my body's gonna be all like...

10:05.325 --> 10:07.292
I am so nervous.

10:07.327 --> 10:09.939
How's my hair? Is my breath okay?
I need gum.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.052
Dad, relax.

10:12.087 --> 10:13.220
It's just an audition.

10:13.255 --> 10:15.222
I am talking about meeting Brady Rice.

10:15.257 --> 10:17.057
Where can a man find a stick of gum?

10:17.092 --> 10:18.292
Brady's not here.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.994
It's called "Pros Versus Schmoes."

10:21.030 --> 10:24.031
He's a pro,
this audition is for schmoes.

10:24.066 --> 10:26.199
Couldn't they call it
"Pros Versus Joes"?

10:26.235 --> 10:27.367
That's a lot less hurtful.

10:27.403 --> 10:30.971
You can stay if you want, but...

10:34.043 --> 10:36.243
That's right, you saw it.

10:36.278 --> 10:38.111
Sorry.

10:39.982 --> 10:42.916
I'm still trying to find
the perfect color dress

10:42.951 --> 10:44.985
that makes me pop on TV.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.088
I've narrowed it down to red,
green, purple, yellow or blue.

10:48.123 --> 10:50.223
So Dad and Daphne
need to stay away from those.

10:50.259 --> 10:53.160
Because brown and orange are so festive?

10:53.195 --> 10:55.362
I just hope they get on the show.

10:55.397 --> 10:57.230
Otherwise I'm going to
have to figure out a way

10:57.266 --> 10:59.166
to get invited to Troy's
seventh wedding in Borneo.

10:59.201 --> 11:02.002
Daphne better hold still right here.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.904
She's making people cry.

11:03.939 --> 11:05.305
Not the kids, the dads.

11:05.341 --> 11:08.241
Don't ask how to samba
if you don't wanna know.

11:08.277 --> 11:11.878
Listen up, people, I'm gonna
give you some intel.

11:11.914 --> 11:13.180
If you wanna get picked for the show,

11:13.215 --> 11:14.981
it's not just about the dancing.

11:15.017 --> 11:18.051
The judges wanna see
a close, happy family.

11:18.087 --> 11:20.053
Someone people can root for.

11:24.293 --> 11:26.059
You guys are the best.

11:26.095 --> 11:28.095
I couldn't ask for a better family.

11:30.299 --> 11:32.265
Oh, we're up. Wish us luck.

11:32.301 --> 11:35.068
We don't need luck. We got me.

11:37.039 --> 11:38.205
Keep up.

11:41.343 --> 11:45.011
Whatever happens, I will
always be proud of you guys.

11:45.047 --> 11:47.245
You guys are my world.

11:47.299 --> 11:49.499
Careful. You're gonna
end up in the weirdo montage.

12:12.351 --> 12:15.219
What happened to my hair gel?

12:15.254 --> 12:16.487
We replaced it with peanut butter.

12:16.522 --> 12:20.357
Great hold, and a scent
that will attract the ladies.

12:20.393 --> 12:22.259
And the squirrels.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.400
What's taking them so long?

12:29.435 --> 12:33.203
I hope Dad didn't go rogue
and do the electric slide.

12:33.239 --> 12:35.039
TOM: We made it!

12:36.442 --> 12:38.342
I'm so happy, I could dance.

12:38.377 --> 12:41.278
But I only do that when the camera's on.

12:41.314 --> 12:44.048
Yay!

12:46.152 --> 12:47.251
What the...

12:47.286 --> 12:49.286
Delicious igloo.

12:49.322 --> 12:51.188
The containers are the "igs,"

12:51.223 --> 12:53.490
and the peanut butter is the "glue."

12:53.526 --> 12:55.259
Use number 64.

12:55.294 --> 12:59.263
I'm starting to think
101 uses is too few.

13:03.369 --> 13:05.336
I want to thank all the little people...

13:05.371 --> 13:08.172
Deathnee, the doll with one arm,

13:08.207 --> 13:10.174
the doll with no head,

13:10.209 --> 13:11.442
the bear whose fur I shaved off.

13:11.477 --> 13:13.277
Sorry to interrupt.

13:13.312 --> 13:14.378
You want to sneak in some practice?

13:14.413 --> 13:16.280
I am practicing...

13:16.315 --> 13:17.448
my victory speech.

13:19.218 --> 13:21.385
I'll help you practice,
but just so you know,

13:21.420 --> 13:23.320
my go-to is...

13:31.197 --> 13:33.297
Thank you, thank you.

13:33.332 --> 13:36.033
For all you little girls out there,

13:36.068 --> 13:39.470
whose dream is to dance,
I'm coming for you.

13:42.174 --> 13:44.475
Thirty minutes until I dance

13:44.510 --> 13:46.276
in front of a national audience.

13:46.312 --> 13:48.345
Dad, relax.

13:48.381 --> 13:50.047
You're gonna be great.

13:50.082 --> 13:52.149
Thanks to you for helping me rehearse.

13:52.184 --> 13:55.119
Daphne was too busy working
on her after-show interview.

13:55.154 --> 13:57.488
(imitating Daphne) "I just want to
stop and take a moment to be real.

13:57.523 --> 14:01.025
I was awesome out there."

14:01.160 --> 14:02.559
It was fun, and hey,

14:02.595 --> 14:05.129
I couldn't let you look bad
in front of Brady Rice.

14:05.164 --> 14:07.097
I'm glad you talked me into this, Harls.

14:07.133 --> 14:09.099
Golfing with my buddies
would've been fun,

14:09.135 --> 14:12.302
but nothing can beat
dancing with my daughters.

14:13.372 --> 14:15.372
This is so exciting.

14:15.407 --> 14:17.374
There are more stars here
than at last year's

14:17.409 --> 14:18.542
"Studs Versus Duds" edition.

14:18.577 --> 14:21.145
I've gotta find Troy Havana.

14:21.180 --> 14:23.247
I just hope he's here.

14:23.282 --> 14:26.316
His daughter better not be dancing
with his cardboard standee.

14:26.352 --> 14:28.418
Hey, let's go check out that food table

14:28.454 --> 14:30.154
and get a refill.

14:30.189 --> 14:31.421
Yeah, we're running on empty.

14:31.457 --> 14:33.390
Hey, look.

14:35.294 --> 14:37.494
It's Brady Rice.

14:37.530 --> 14:39.196
Don't embarrass yourself, Dad.

14:44.370 --> 14:46.470
Way to go. You played it cool.

14:46.505 --> 14:49.406
See? I'm not as much
of a schmo as people think.

14:51.377 --> 14:55.179
You better have a spare shirt,

14:55.214 --> 14:56.280
'cause I'm not touching that.

15:02.388 --> 15:04.154
Oh.

15:12.131 --> 15:15.265
- Did someone hear an opportunity?
- Excuse me?

15:15.301 --> 15:18.235
You're probably wondering
what this is on my back, right?

15:18.270 --> 15:20.237
No. I'm wondering why you're in my way.

15:25.277 --> 15:26.577
In any family with kids,

15:26.612 --> 15:28.378
there's always
a ton of stuff on the floor.

15:28.414 --> 15:30.414
Picking it all up is endless.

15:30.449 --> 15:32.516
This makes it easy, and fun.

15:38.357 --> 15:40.357
Somebody get this man a water.

15:45.264 --> 15:46.330
I think there could be
a real future here.

15:46.365 --> 15:48.131
Great invention.

15:48.167 --> 15:52.269
Can-do backstory about you
sneaking in here to show it to me.

15:52.304 --> 15:54.371
Actually, I'm here with
my dad and my sister.

15:54.406 --> 15:55.439
They're also on the show tonight.

15:55.474 --> 15:57.541
Oh, so that's your family?

15:59.511 --> 16:02.379
I saw them earlier.
Fantastic dance moves.

16:02.414 --> 16:05.182
Big, close family.
That's a winning combination.

16:05.217 --> 16:06.350
The judges love that kind of thing.

16:06.385 --> 16:08.452
Yeah, my sister Rachel says that's key.

16:08.487 --> 16:11.488
She's the one over there
practicing her faces.

16:11.523 --> 16:13.123
That's her "ooh, I hope
he doesn't drop her."

16:13.158 --> 16:14.558
Harley, I'll make you a deal.

16:14.593 --> 16:17.394
I'll fund your invention
and make you gobs of money.

16:17.429 --> 16:20.264
- Just one thing.
- Anything. You name it.

16:20.299 --> 16:22.366
Get your family to
drop out of the competition.

16:22.401 --> 16:24.368
Something else?

16:27.684 --> 16:29.021
Wait.

16:29.118 --> 16:32.554
You want me to get my dad
and my sister to drop out.

16:32.621 --> 16:35.455
Two problems. My dad and my sister.

16:35.490 --> 16:37.524
They're my only competition.

16:37.549 --> 16:40.404
I came to win. Why else would I be here?

16:40.429 --> 16:42.963
To meet Brady Rice? I own his team.

16:42.998 --> 16:45.265
You want to win by
making other people quit?

16:45.300 --> 16:48.068
That's not very nice.

16:48.103 --> 16:50.971
Nice? I didn't get
to where I am by being nice.

16:51.006 --> 16:53.406
Look, kid, you play this right,

16:53.442 --> 16:55.375
and in a few months,

16:55.410 --> 16:58.178
your vacuum gizmo will be
in stores nationwide.

16:58.213 --> 17:00.080
So what do you think?

17:02.251 --> 17:04.151
(cheering)

17:04.185 --> 17:06.286
MAN: Five minutes to show time.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.387
I think you're nothing
like I thought you would be.

17:08.423 --> 17:11.157
There's no way I'm asking
my family to drop out,

17:11.193 --> 17:13.226
especially after how hard
they've been practicing.

17:13.262 --> 17:15.162
Well, my dad anyway.

17:15.196 --> 17:18.064
You know how much money
you're throwing away?

17:20.301 --> 17:22.202
It's like Harley Diaz always says.

17:22.237 --> 17:24.371
Having to choose
between family and business,

17:26.175 --> 17:27.374
is no choice at all.

17:27.409 --> 17:29.209
That's cute.

17:29.244 --> 17:31.011
Dumb but cute.

17:31.046 --> 17:33.013
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

17:36.285 --> 17:38.985
So I told him I didn't care
how much money I was giving up,

17:39.021 --> 17:41.321
'cause I couldn't ask you guys
to drop out.

17:41.356 --> 17:44.257
Wow, Harls, I am really proud of
you for taking the high road.

17:44.293 --> 17:46.426
Did he say how much money specifically?

17:46.461 --> 17:49.329
That jerk thinks
he can buy whatever he wants.

17:49.364 --> 17:52.098
Go out there
and step-step-kick his butt.

17:52.134 --> 17:54.367
Hello. That's what I do.

17:57.339 --> 17:59.105
(crashing sound)

17:59.141 --> 18:00.207
DAPHNE: I slipped.

18:07.082 --> 18:09.282
That's use number 100 for peanut butter.

18:09.318 --> 18:11.318
Making Troy Havana slip and fall.

18:11.353 --> 18:14.187
Nobody treats our sister like that.

18:17.059 --> 18:18.258
Looks like you sprained your ankle.

18:20.395 --> 18:21.995
We're sorry, Daphne.

18:22.030 --> 18:23.396
We didn't mean for it to happen to you.

18:23.432 --> 18:25.198
This is our fault.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.067
Don't blame peanut butter.

18:30.038 --> 18:31.938
Now you've got no deal,

18:31.974 --> 18:34.207
and your family won't dance anyway.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.376
- You should've taken my offer.
- I don't want it.

18:40.048 --> 18:41.414
I can't believe it.

18:41.450 --> 18:43.283
He's going to end up winning.

18:43.318 --> 18:45.151
He's not going to win.

18:45.187 --> 18:46.253
Someone else can dance with Dad.

18:46.288 --> 18:47.354
Who?

18:47.389 --> 18:50.290
- You. You know all the moves.
- Yeah.

18:50.325 --> 18:52.192
You can totally do it.

18:52.227 --> 18:54.261
As long as you don't
wear pink or possibly purple.

18:54.296 --> 18:55.996
That's my back-up outfit.

18:56.031 --> 18:57.964
I don't know how good I'll be.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.299
It doesn't matter.

18:59.334 --> 19:01.268
The only thing I wanted to do tonight

19:01.303 --> 19:03.270
was dance with my daughter.

19:11.413 --> 19:13.179
Now go get
my favorite thing in the world.

19:13.215 --> 19:15.048
The winner's trophy?

19:15.083 --> 19:19.119
Revenge. Now get to wardrobe.

19:21.056 --> 19:23.290
ANNOUNCER: <i>Stellar performance
by Team Havana.</i>

19:23.325 --> 19:25.258
<i>They're gonna be tough to beat</i>

19:25.294 --> 19:27.260
<i>with a score of 38.</i>

19:27.296 --> 19:28.328
You're gonna dance?

19:28.363 --> 19:30.063
That's right, she is.

19:30.098 --> 19:32.165
This schmoe's got
more than one talented daughter.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.135
Good luck. We just got 38 out of 40.

19:35.170 --> 19:38.271
Pretty great, right, Savannah?

19:38.307 --> 19:41.308
She hates me. I don't know why.

19:41.343 --> 19:43.443
Maybe because you
named her Savannah Havana.

19:43.478 --> 19:46.146
Oh, and you know, the pure evil thing.

19:46.181 --> 19:48.381
Whatever. I don't have
to find the dance floor.

19:48.417 --> 19:50.350
I own it.

19:50.385 --> 19:52.218
And I'm talking about the dance,

19:52.254 --> 19:54.988
and I actually own
this building as well.

19:56.425 --> 19:58.291
ANNOUNCER: <i>Please welcome to the stage</i>

19:58.327 --> 20:01.461
<i>Harley Diaz, dancing with her dad Tom.</i>

20:04.333 --> 20:08.368
♪ ♪

21:05.327 --> 21:09.095
<i>With 39 points,
Team Diaz takes the lead.</i>

21:12.167 --> 21:14.300
Yes, but there's still
a few teams that have to go.

21:14.336 --> 21:16.236
- We didn't win yet.
- We beat Troy.

21:16.271 --> 21:17.437
That's all the win I need.

21:30.352 --> 21:33.286
Considering I went there
to sell a cleaning device,

21:33.321 --> 21:35.355
I'll take second place for dancing.

21:35.390 --> 21:38.158
I'm just happy Brady won.
That guy's the king.

21:38.193 --> 21:41.394
HARLEY: Maybe someone else will
want to bankroll the Floor Finder.

21:41.430 --> 21:45.031
I mean, Troy Havana's
not the only investor out there.

21:47.402 --> 21:50.303
Oh, and Harley, I had such a blast

21:50.338 --> 21:51.438
doing the show,
I have something for you.

21:51.473 --> 21:53.106
Hold out your hand.

21:55.143 --> 21:58.344
A Diaz card? For what?

21:58.380 --> 22:00.113
If you didn't play yours,

22:00.148 --> 22:01.448
I never would've gone
to dance class with Daphne,

22:01.483 --> 22:03.316
and none of this would've happened.

22:03.351 --> 22:05.018
Thanks, Dad.

22:06.354 --> 22:08.088
And here's one from me.

22:08.123 --> 22:10.323
Thanks to you, I got to go backstage

22:10.358 --> 22:12.158
at my favorite TV show.

22:12.194 --> 22:15.328
Let's see what magic
you can work with this one.

22:20.469 --> 22:23.069
Actually, you got enough.

22:23.105 --> 22:24.437
We're good.

22:24.461 --> 22:25.644
