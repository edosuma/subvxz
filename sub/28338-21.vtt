WEBVTT

00:01.041 --> 00:02.751
Whee! Pancakes!

00:04.871 --> 00:06.751
Ahem. Hello, everyone,

00:06.751 --> 00:10.331
and welcome to the 10th biweekly
Pancake Day!

00:10.331 --> 00:12.871
[all cheer]

00:12.871 --> 00:14.251
Hey! Looking good, Greg.

00:14.251 --> 00:16.751
Hey, Susan,
don't eat that all at once.

00:16.751 --> 00:19.121
And Glowworm, may I say
you're looking

00:19.121 --> 00:21.121
particularly glowy today.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.661
Yeah, I've been
hitting the gym.

00:23.661 --> 00:25.961
Well, whatever you're doing,
keep it up.

00:25.961 --> 00:28.501
Yeah, Billy Boy,
watch your papa

00:28.501 --> 00:30.331
show you how
it's really done.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.871
First, you got to slather on

00:31.871 --> 00:34.701
some good old-fashioned
maple syrup.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.501
[strains]

00:36.501 --> 00:38.411
You... can have some...

00:38.411 --> 00:39.961
[yells]

00:39.961 --> 00:40.961
...when I'm done with it.

00:40.961 --> 00:42.371
Here!

00:42.371 --> 00:43.621
Aww.

00:43.621 --> 00:44.911
Don't you worry,
Billy Boy.

00:44.911 --> 00:46.871
Daddy's going to find you
some syrup.

00:46.871 --> 00:49.701
Hey, Spider, can you get
some syrup for my kid?

00:49.701 --> 00:52.161
So then I say,
"That's not a pencil,

00:52.161 --> 00:54.541
-that's a pen!"
-[both laugh]

00:54.541 --> 00:55.871
Slacking on the job, huh?

00:55.871 --> 00:58.461
Guess I got to do everything
around here.

00:58.461 --> 00:59.701
Hey, Spider.

00:59.701 --> 01:00.871
Hey, Dave.

01:00.871 --> 01:02.411
Richard.

01:02.411 --> 01:05.661
What can I do for you
on this glorious Pancake Day?

01:05.661 --> 01:08.961
Well, my kid needs syrup,
but we're all out.

01:08.961 --> 01:10.701
Out of syrup? Hmm.

01:10.701 --> 01:12.621
I'm afraid that was
our last batch.

01:12.621 --> 01:13.871
[loud crash]

01:16.871 --> 01:18.371
Eclipsa's spells.

01:18.371 --> 01:20.001
What are they doing
out of their room?

01:20.001 --> 01:23.001
Now, now, let's not jump
to conclusions here.

01:23.001 --> 01:25.661
Maybe they just want
some pancakes.

01:27.541 --> 01:29.201
Hey, good morning, gang.

01:29.201 --> 01:31.001
We're having pancakes.

01:31.001 --> 01:32.871
We're working
on the syrup thing.

01:32.871 --> 01:36.001
We don't have any--
That's a bit of a problem, but--

01:36.001 --> 01:37.621
Perimeter secure.
Kill the lights.

01:38.751 --> 01:39.961
-Oh, boy.
-[grunts]

01:43.041 --> 01:44.661
Okay, that's it.

01:45.791 --> 01:48.001
Hey there, buddy.

01:48.001 --> 01:49.501
Now, I know you're
the new queen's spells,

01:49.501 --> 01:53.081
but you can't just go around
wrecking other spells' rooms.

01:53.081 --> 01:54.791
Now, whatever problem
you're having,

01:54.791 --> 01:57.201
I'm sure we can find a perfectly
good solution--

01:57.201 --> 01:59.081
-[screams]
-Out of my way.

01:59.081 --> 02:01.121
[all, gasping]
Spider!

02:01.121 --> 02:03.041
[groaning]

02:03.041 --> 02:04.041
Spider, you okay?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.501
Oh. Y-Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm fine.

02:06.501 --> 02:10.041
Just had a little
misunderstanding back there.

02:10.041 --> 02:13.161
Of course, that was probably
all my fault.

02:13.161 --> 02:15.041
I'm always screwing
everything up.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.581
Oh, no.

02:16.581 --> 02:18.291
They took his
self-esteem.

02:18.291 --> 02:19.961
Cool. So, uh...

02:19.961 --> 02:22.161
you're still going
to talk to them, right?

02:22.161 --> 02:23.501
They're coming back!

02:25.161 --> 02:27.961
Okay, that's the last of them.
Now let's find that glowworm.

02:27.961 --> 02:29.201
[whimpering]

02:30.961 --> 02:32.161
[gunfire]

02:34.501 --> 02:35.831
[meows]

02:42.871 --> 02:44.701
All clear. Not here.

02:44.701 --> 02:46.251
All right, you heard them.
Next room.

02:46.251 --> 02:48.251
Time's of the essence, people.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.081
Wait. They took Wormy!

02:50.081 --> 02:51.961
Someone should go
after them.

02:51.961 --> 02:53.121
I'll save him.

02:53.121 --> 02:55.121
Except I'll probably
just make it worse.

02:55.121 --> 02:58.121
Oh, why do I bother doing
anything?

02:58.121 --> 03:00.201
You're in no condition
to go out there.

03:00.201 --> 03:02.621
One of us will go
instead, like...

03:02.621 --> 03:04.701
-Narwhal, why don't you go?
-Hmm?

03:04.701 --> 03:06.661
What? Me?

03:06.661 --> 03:08.371
Why? I--

03:08.371 --> 03:10.161
Aren't you Spider's
best friend?

03:10.161 --> 03:13.201
I mean, we hang out
occasionally, but...

03:13.201 --> 03:15.411
[Snail Spell]
You guys hang out all the time.

03:15.411 --> 03:18.121
Yeah, you're always chatting
it up at the lunch tables.

03:18.121 --> 03:20.291
Didn't you guys plan
a road trip together?

03:20.291 --> 03:22.411
Uh, isn't he godfather
to your children?

03:22.411 --> 03:26.201
Yeah, but who isn't a godfather
to a few kids?

03:26.201 --> 03:27.831
Shame on you, Richard.

03:27.831 --> 03:29.961
Fine. I'll go.

03:31.291 --> 03:33.081
Quick, shut the door.

03:33.081 --> 03:34.701
Huh? What?

03:34.701 --> 03:36.331
[sighs]

03:36.331 --> 03:37.331
Huh?

03:40.121 --> 03:41.121
Whoa.

03:42.461 --> 03:44.201
I have got
to get out more.

03:44.201 --> 03:46.701
I didn't even know
we had this many queens.

03:46.701 --> 03:48.291
We're all clear.
Let's move.

03:48.291 --> 03:49.581
Wait!

03:49.581 --> 03:50.911
All right,
on my mark.

03:50.911 --> 03:53.371
Three, two, one.

03:53.371 --> 03:54.411
Hey, I don't want
to interrupt,

03:54.411 --> 03:56.371
but could I get that little
glowworm back?

03:56.371 --> 03:59.041
Sir, what is that sound
coming out of your face?

03:59.041 --> 04:01.121
The real spells
are working here.

04:01.121 --> 04:02.831
Ahem. May I help you?

04:02.831 --> 04:04.291
Aah!

04:04.291 --> 04:05.621
Scan the room.

04:07.291 --> 04:09.081
-Do you mind?
-Were you born in a barn?

04:09.081 --> 04:11.251
All clear.
Let's keep moving.

04:12.251 --> 04:13.411
Uh, so about--

04:13.411 --> 04:14.961
[groans]

04:14.961 --> 04:17.081
I'm missing pancakes
because of this.

04:17.081 --> 04:18.961
Can't you just give back
my little buddy?

04:18.961 --> 04:20.371
-Come on.
-Sir!

04:20.371 --> 04:21.911
Go back to your cake party.

04:21.911 --> 04:23.331
Your worm friend
will be returned to you

04:23.331 --> 04:24.581
at the end
of the mission.

04:24.581 --> 04:26.371
Oh, really? Well, that's--

04:26.371 --> 04:28.661
-If he survives.
-What?

04:28.661 --> 04:30.001
Hey, what do you mean by--?

04:30.001 --> 04:31.251
There's movement
up ahead.

04:35.411 --> 04:37.001
We have a visual.
Formation Indigo.

04:37.001 --> 04:38.331
Indigo Waning Moon.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.291
That spell is intense.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.621
That's Eclipsa's
most powerful spell.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.541
It don't even have a name.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.911
Ouroboros, get the containment
unit ready.

04:52.911 --> 04:55.161
Locked and loaded, sir.

04:55.161 --> 04:56.501
Whoa, what is that thing?

04:56.501 --> 04:59.161
It's a dark magic containment
cylinder, best in the business.

04:59.161 --> 05:00.621
It looks like
a pickle jar.

05:00.621 --> 05:03.161
Yeah, yeah,
it is a pickle jar.

05:03.161 --> 05:04.541
Pickle jars work great,

05:04.541 --> 05:06.501
as long as you don't
knock it off the shelf.

05:06.501 --> 05:09.201
Knocking stuff over
is super fun, Mom.

05:17.161 --> 05:19.461
Follow the target.
Don't let it out of the light.

05:19.461 --> 05:20.461
Roger.

05:22.751 --> 05:24.161
[mewling]

05:25.411 --> 05:27.331
So, when are you going
to spring into action?

05:27.331 --> 05:28.831
Me? I'm not doing nothing

05:28.831 --> 05:31.581
on account I'm a weenie
and I don't have a head.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.911
Yeah! Go get them, boys!

05:40.911 --> 05:42.831
Self-Esteem,
get a light on this.

05:45.331 --> 05:46.961
What the--?
The target is still at large.

05:46.961 --> 05:48.411
I want another perimeter
sweep right now.

05:48.411 --> 05:51.501
[all]
Uh... uh...

05:51.501 --> 05:52.701
What?

05:52.701 --> 05:55.541
That spell. It's... it's....

05:55.541 --> 05:57.081
It's what? Speak up.

06:02.501 --> 06:04.581
[all scream]

06:04.581 --> 06:06.041
[groans]

06:06.041 --> 06:08.001
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

06:09.251 --> 06:10.501
Where'd the others go?

06:10.501 --> 06:12.371
Where's Void Cat?
Where is Goth Moth?

06:12.371 --> 06:13.791
It's just us now.

06:13.791 --> 06:16.661
What was that?
What happened to Hypnoslumber?

06:16.661 --> 06:18.251
That's what that spell does.

06:18.251 --> 06:20.161
One touch, and your days
are numbered.

06:20.161 --> 06:22.581
What do you think happened
to my head?

06:22.581 --> 06:24.621
I didn't know it was going
to be like this.

06:26.791 --> 06:28.621
Your friend is no use to us
without his glowlight.

06:28.621 --> 06:30.161
You may as well
take him now.

06:30.161 --> 06:32.831
Yeah, yeah, just go home to that
little cake party or whatever.

06:32.831 --> 06:35.291
But what are you guys going to
do without the glowworm light?

06:35.291 --> 06:38.701
Don't worry about that.
We have a plan B.

06:38.701 --> 06:40.751
Oh! Well, that's a relief.

06:40.751 --> 06:43.461
I'll show myself out.

06:43.461 --> 06:45.751
-Do you have the device?
-Yup.

06:45.751 --> 06:49.751
One press of this button and
this whole place goes sky-high.

06:49.751 --> 06:51.661
Wait, what did you just say?

06:51.661 --> 06:53.911
You-- You can't just blow up
the whole dimension.

06:53.911 --> 06:56.251
My kid still needs
to eat his pancakes.

06:56.251 --> 06:58.201
You know what happens
if we don't catch that thing?

06:58.201 --> 07:00.791
First we die.
Then everyone dies.

07:00.791 --> 07:02.581
It'll eat its way
through every dimension

07:02.581 --> 07:04.501
until there's nothing left.

07:04.501 --> 07:05.831
But there has to be
another way.

07:05.831 --> 07:07.831
-All the other spells--
-We spells were created

07:07.831 --> 07:09.411
to serve the queens of Mewni.

07:09.411 --> 07:11.751
If we have to sacrifice
ourselves to keep them safe,

07:11.751 --> 07:12.911
so be it.

07:15.461 --> 07:17.621
This is it, fellas.
Any last words?

07:17.621 --> 07:20.581
I just want to say,
you guys are the best teammates

07:20.581 --> 07:22.411
a spell could ask for.

07:22.411 --> 07:24.701
-I love you guys.
-[gasps]

07:24.701 --> 07:27.621
Aw, Oro,
I love you too.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.621
Uh... guys?

07:29.621 --> 07:31.701
Behind you.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.371
[all]
Huh?

07:33.371 --> 07:36.291
Uh, what are we supposed
to be looking at here?

07:36.291 --> 07:37.701
The spell.

07:37.701 --> 07:40.121
It's right on top of you.

07:40.121 --> 07:42.871
Watch out!
Don't make any sudden movements.

07:42.871 --> 07:45.661
Hey, is this kid playing
some kind of trick on us?

07:45.661 --> 07:46.701
There it goes.

07:48.661 --> 07:51.291
Seriously, did none of you
see that?

07:51.291 --> 07:52.621
No. How could we?

07:52.621 --> 07:54.701
You can only see the spell
using the glow light.

07:54.701 --> 07:57.541
Uh, what do you think we were
using your friend for?

07:57.541 --> 07:59.331
I don't need to see it
to know where it is.

07:59.331 --> 08:01.791
I have echolocation.

08:01.791 --> 08:05.081
Hey, I have echolocation.

08:05.081 --> 08:06.791
Guys, I can fix this.

08:06.791 --> 08:08.161
-What?
-You can?

08:08.161 --> 08:09.411
Follow me.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.581
Okay, here's the plan.

08:12.581 --> 08:14.751
I'll go in there and chase
the spell out with my magic.

08:14.751 --> 08:16.581
You still got
that pickle jar?

08:18.541 --> 08:20.661
Right here.
But are you sure about this?

08:20.661 --> 08:22.201
Yeah, there's no way
you're strong enough

08:22.201 --> 08:23.871
to take that thing
on your own.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.911
Oh, I'm definitely
not strong enough.

08:25.911 --> 08:29.751
But when all else fails,
a narwhal's got to step up.

08:29.751 --> 08:30.871
[inhales deeply]

08:30.871 --> 08:33.331
Oh, boy, I really don't want
to do this.

08:34.331 --> 08:35.871
[hums]

08:46.251 --> 08:47.911
Dang. You know
he could do this?

08:47.911 --> 08:50.041
[Narwhal]
Okay, I got him on the run!

08:50.041 --> 08:51.621
Get that pickle jar ready.

08:51.621 --> 08:53.251
But where am I aiming it?

08:53.251 --> 08:54.961
[Narwhal]
Just point it directly at me.

08:54.961 --> 08:56.701
Uh, roger that.

08:56.701 --> 08:58.661
Here it comes.

09:01.411 --> 09:02.751
Did you get it?

09:02.751 --> 09:04.461
Narwhal, get your eyes
on this.

09:09.121 --> 09:11.001
Yeah. We got it.

09:15.001 --> 09:17.411
Ha-ha! Check out
my little bandage butt.

09:17.411 --> 09:19.161
Oh, where'd you get that?

09:19.161 --> 09:20.411
Beats me.

09:20.411 --> 09:22.581
I guess I took a tumble
somewhere.

09:22.581 --> 09:24.291
Hey, Narwhal, couldn't you
bring him back

09:24.291 --> 09:25.581
in one piece?

09:25.581 --> 09:26.831
Sorry about that.

09:26.831 --> 09:28.701
You did good, kid,

09:28.701 --> 09:31.371
bringing Glowworm back
all by yourself.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.911
Well, somebody had to do it,
right?

09:33.911 --> 09:36.621
Oh, and guess what?
We found more syrup.

09:36.621 --> 09:39.581
Turns out Spider was hoarding
a secret stash in the basement.

09:39.581 --> 09:42.961
Blessed be this luscious bounty
of sunlight and nectar.

09:42.961 --> 09:44.911
It's true. I'm a liar.

09:44.911 --> 09:47.291
There's always syrup.
There's never no syrup.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.001
I'm so sorry.

09:49.001 --> 09:50.461
It's okay.

09:50.461 --> 09:52.081
Is it really?

09:52.081 --> 09:53.201
Kind of iffy.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.161
But now we have
infinite syrup.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.121
That's a good problem
to have.

09:57.121 --> 10:00.331
Hey, Eclipsa's spells.
Y'all want some pancakes?

10:00.331 --> 10:02.081
Nah, we don't want
to hang out with you kids.

10:02.081 --> 10:03.831
Eat your pancakes.

10:03.831 --> 10:05.501
[Pyro Pony]
Catch you on the flippity flop.

10:06.701 --> 10:08.661
Well, they sure
are friendly.

10:08.661 --> 10:10.411
Anyway,
back to syrup.

10:10.411 --> 10:13.791
I vote we pour it in a giant tub
and swim around in it.
