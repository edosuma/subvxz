WEBVTT

02:01.329 --> 02:02.747
Bring it out.

02:07.877 --> 02:08.878
Phew.

02:19.764 --> 02:20.806
Take it easy.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.315
Well, well, well.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.108
Look who's here.

02:31.567 --> 02:33.944
Up to your old tricks already,
huh, Nygma?

02:34.028 --> 02:36.572
Whatever are you talking about, Batman?

02:36.697 --> 02:38.282
The last time you delivered
one of these,

02:38.366 --> 02:39.617
it almost killed Commissioner Gordon.

02:39.700 --> 02:40.701
What's your point?

02:40.826 --> 02:43.621
- What's in the box?
- None of your business.

02:43.954 --> 02:46.290
- I'm making it my business.
- Stop!

02:47.041 --> 02:48.542
What are you doing here?

02:51.253 --> 02:52.880
Don't worry, sir, we've got him.

02:52.963 --> 02:56.092
His name is Edward Nygma,
otherwise known as the Riddler.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.552
I know who he is, you young fool.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.805
It's all right, C.B.

03:00.971 --> 03:02.807
These are two old friends of mine.

03:02.973 --> 03:05.226
Before you louts
sink your fists into me,

03:05.309 --> 03:08.604
I'd like you to meet my new partner,
Charles Baxter,

03:08.729 --> 03:12.566
president of the multimillion-dollar
Wacko Toy Corporation,

03:12.942 --> 03:15.695
and the man who has licensed
my Riddler persona

03:15.778 --> 03:19.907
and my exclusive puzzle technology
for his newline of toys.

03:24.745 --> 03:26.080
We're going to make a killing.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.790
That's what I'm afraid of.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.501
Now, now, I know what you're thinking.

03:30.668 --> 03:33.504
But those silly riddle crimes
are a thing of the past.

03:33.754 --> 03:35.965
Ancient history that's gone now.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.384
I'm a new man.

03:38.551 --> 03:42.012
But you probably won't figure that out
until it's too late.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.390
Do you know who
you're dealing with here, Baxter?

03:44.557 --> 03:47.935
Yes, a man who's going
to make my company millions.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.687
Everyone's heard of the Riddler.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.523
You can't buy that kind
of market recognition.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.569
Leave him alone, or I'll swear out
a complaint against you for harassment.

03:58.487 --> 04:00.281
Here's a little something for the kid.

04:04.535 --> 04:07.163
<i>Still no verdict
in the trial of the Penguin.</i>

04:07.329 --> 04:09.582
<i>Though apprehended
last month by the Batman,</i>

04:09.665 --> 04:11.208
<i>the jury still remains unconvinced</i>

04:11.292 --> 04:13.461
<i>of the felon's guilt
despite overwhelming...</i>

04:13.544 --> 04:18.007
As far as I can tell, it looks like
a normal toy. No hidden gimmicks.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.258
You wanna look at it?

04:21.969 --> 04:23.053
Guess not.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.973
<i>Finally in the news,
there was a burglary</i>

04:26.056 --> 04:28.017
<i>last night in the Market Lane District.</i>

04:28.350 --> 04:31.145
<i>Thieves made off with rare
antiquities and artifacts</i>

04:31.312 --> 04:33.731
<i>from the Newman Import & Export Company.</i>

04:33.898 --> 04:35.232
Wait. What's that?

04:35.483 --> 04:40.029
<i>A Ming vase from the third century,
an 800-year-old tapestry.</i>

04:40.112 --> 04:42.114
<i>I can't replace these.</i>

04:42.448 --> 04:44.867
<i>Those were things
of the past, Batman.</i>

04:45.034 --> 04:47.161
<i>Ancient history that's gone now.</i>

04:47.328 --> 04:48.746
<i>I'm a new man.</i>

04:48.913 --> 04:52.041
<i>But you probably won't figure
that out until it's too late.</i>

04:54.502 --> 04:56.128
- He did it.
- Who?

04:56.337 --> 04:58.756
The Riddler. Remember what he said?

04:59.256 --> 05:03.260
"Things of the past."
"Ancient history that's gone now."

05:04.220 --> 05:05.221
Look.

05:06.430 --> 05:09.642
Gee, I don't know.
His riddles aren't usually that subtle.

05:09.975 --> 05:12.978
Besides, he's got a multimillion-dollar
deal with that toy company.

05:13.145 --> 05:15.856
Why would he throw it away
over some stupid riddle crime?

05:16.023 --> 05:19.235
Because that's the way
his warped mind works. He's obsessed.

05:19.610 --> 05:20.861
Hey, look.

05:24.740 --> 05:26.951
<i>Greetings, little riddle-tykes!</i>

05:28.702 --> 05:30.579
<i>It's time for riddle number</i>

05:30.830 --> 05:35.251
<i>3-1-7-5-3-7-0-1 .</i>

05:37.628 --> 05:40.714
<i>Where in the world
can you have the most fun?</i>

05:41.006 --> 05:43.884
<i>In any store that sells
Wacko Toys, of course.</i>

05:43.968 --> 05:48.055
<i>That's because Wacko makes the entire
line of Riddler games and puzzles,</i>

05:48.389 --> 05:50.391
<i>like the Riddler's Riddle-mid.</i>

05:50.558 --> 05:53.102
<i>Hours of fun for only $19.95.</i>

05:53.394 --> 05:55.980
<i>So grab your parents,
or just their wallets,</i>

05:56.146 --> 05:58.899
<i>and run on down to
your nearest toy store.</i>

05:59.066 --> 06:01.360
<i>Tell them the Riddler sent you.</i>

06:02.444 --> 06:03.863
This riddle number.

06:04.029 --> 06:05.823
I wonder why he used that.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.741
And why did he put a map up there?

06:08.075 --> 06:09.952
It's got eight digits.

06:11.203 --> 06:12.705
So does a map coordinate.

06:20.462 --> 06:21.922
3-1-7-5,

06:22.673 --> 06:24.216
3-7-0-1 .

06:27.052 --> 06:29.179
It's the downtown Financial District.

06:31.056 --> 06:33.017
What's that building right there
in the center?

06:36.145 --> 06:37.897
The First National Bank.

07:04.798 --> 07:07.551
It's after 10:00.
He should've been here by now.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.179
You know,
maybe we're reading into this thing.

07:10.262 --> 07:12.139
Maybe he wasn't sending a riddle at all.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.147
He flipped it over.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.691
- What?
- The number.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.527
He flipped it upside-down when
he turned the chalkboard over.

07:29.573 --> 07:32.201
-10 Leslie?
- It's an address.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.411
We're in the wrong place.

07:42.252 --> 07:44.588
Not a sign of him anywhere, Mr. Nygma.

07:45.005 --> 07:46.840
He must be losing his touch.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.343
All right, hurry up
and get out of there.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.698
Let's go.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.575
Had enough?

08:56.869 --> 08:57.995
Look out!

09:03.208 --> 09:04.209
Robin?

09:09.798 --> 09:10.841
My foot.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.060
Let's go.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.275
- You okay?
- Yeah.

09:28.358 --> 09:31.445
But you better go on without me.
I'll be okay.

09:31.528 --> 09:33.238
Go! Go!

09:49.963 --> 09:51.131
Oh, no!

09:52.549 --> 09:53.759
Give me that.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.062
Do something!

10:06.438 --> 10:08.065
Hold on!

10:17.783 --> 10:18.951
Pull the brake!

10:54.027 --> 10:55.821
Blast this thing.

10:59.324 --> 11:01.910
How do you solve
this contraption, Nygma?

11:02.494 --> 11:04.788
Easy. You just have to be

11:05.289 --> 11:06.373
a genius.

11:10.752 --> 11:12.838
Well, you are a genius, my boy.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.716
Sales are up 20% across the country.

11:15.799 --> 11:18.302
These toys of yours are brilliant.

11:21.763 --> 11:25.893
Where did you find him, C.B.?
He's so adorable.

11:26.518 --> 11:27.519
Who?

11:30.355 --> 11:32.774
Of course you, silly.

11:33.066 --> 11:37.196
And you're so smart.
Ijust love a man with brains.

11:37.988 --> 11:41.617
Gee, I bet you say that to
all the geniuses.

11:41.700 --> 11:46.580
Oh, Mr. Riddler,
can you tell me what these do?

11:50.083 --> 11:53.712
Excuse me, sir, but you have
a phone call in the other room.

12:05.849 --> 12:08.602
You're adorable.

12:10.270 --> 12:11.271
Hello?

12:11.855 --> 12:12.940
<i>Hello?</i>

12:14.483 --> 12:15.984
Adorable, huh?

12:18.237 --> 12:20.405
I don't believe you were invited.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.450
I'm on to you, Nygma.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.037
You're still chasing riddles.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.958
<i>You're still giving them.</i>

12:31.041 --> 12:32.626
<i>Is that what you believe?</i>

12:33.001 --> 12:35.254
<i>Well, how do you know
what to believe, Batman?</i>

12:35.545 --> 12:37.673
Maybe I'm not giving clues at all.

12:37.839 --> 12:40.425
Maybe you're seeing things
that aren't there.

12:40.592 --> 12:43.262
But then again,
maybe I am giving you clues.

12:43.428 --> 12:46.014
I could be giving you a clue right now,
couldn't I?

12:46.223 --> 12:49.935
Of course, it's possible
that you're just paranoid.

12:50.602 --> 12:53.355
By the way, did you see my latest toy?

12:53.522 --> 12:55.065
It's a two-way radio.

12:57.943 --> 13:02.614
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
you to meet the great Batman.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.033
He's here because he hasn't got a clue.

13:09.496 --> 13:10.872
You can play all you like.

13:11.331 --> 13:13.625
But you and I both know
that I'm going to put you away

13:13.792 --> 13:15.836
because you can't help yourself.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.212
You can't stop.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.050
And I'll be waiting.

13:39.484 --> 13:40.736
He's right, you know.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.530
- Who?
- Batman.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.158
He is going to catch me,
sooner or later.

13:46.658 --> 13:49.202
Gee, boss, you're scaring me.

13:49.369 --> 13:50.829
You're talking kind of crazy.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.706
Don't you ever call me that!

13:52.873 --> 13:56.251
I fooled the police, the doctors,
the parole board, all of them.

13:56.335 --> 14:00.213
There's only one person who's ever
been able to challenge me. Batman.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.758
He's the only one worthy of the game.

14:02.966 --> 14:06.511
But you said sooner or later,
he's gonna catch you.

14:06.678 --> 14:09.556
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm never going back to Arkham.

14:11.767 --> 14:15.312
So I guess there's only one thing to do.

14:20.525 --> 14:21.860
Give me lights.

14:23.236 --> 14:24.321
Sound check.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.031
We got speed.

14:26.114 --> 14:28.784
All right, let's have
places, everyone.

14:28.992 --> 14:30.744
Here's your script, Mr. Nygma.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.497
I already know what I'm going to say.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.378
Quiet on the set.
We're going live.

14:40.921 --> 14:41.963
Action.

14:42.422 --> 14:45.217
Hey, folks. Wouldn't it be great
to be a kid again,

14:45.425 --> 14:49.638
enjoying all those wonderful moments
of childhood with your favorite toys?

14:49.805 --> 14:51.807
Not like that,
you'll break it.

14:53.433 --> 14:57.938
Yes. Well, you can recapture
your childhood with Wacko Toys.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.606
All you have to do is pick up

14:59.773 --> 15:03.151
one of the Riddler's puzzles
at your favorite store.

15:03.318 --> 15:08.031
Then go back to where it all started,
with toys.

15:08.573 --> 15:11.118
Come on, be a kid again.

15:14.162 --> 15:16.456
He's going to hit
the Gotham Convention Center.

15:16.623 --> 15:17.791
How did you figure that?

15:18.208 --> 15:20.460
Because of the clue
he's deliberately giving me.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.674
- What clue?
- He said,

15:25.841 --> 15:28.677
"Go back to where it started,
with toys."

15:30.095 --> 15:31.388
The toy fair.

16:53.428 --> 16:56.723
<i>Hello, Batman.
This is it, the end of the game.</i>

16:56.890 --> 16:59.976
<i>I'm a little sad, actually.
You were a worthy opponent.</i>

17:00.060 --> 17:03.188
<i>But then, I told you I'd make a killing
at the toy fair.</i>

17:06.775 --> 17:09.027
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

17:09.486 --> 17:11.613
<i>eight, seven,</i>

17:12.614 --> 17:14.616
<i>six, five,</i>

17:15.617 --> 17:16.868
<i>four,</i>

17:17.869 --> 17:19.663
<i>three,</i>

17:19.955 --> 17:21.748
<i>two...</i>

17:37.264 --> 17:39.516
I always feel sad at funerals.

17:39.975 --> 17:43.353
Yes, truly, part of me has died tonight.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.565
And so it is time to move on.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.241
You! I don't believe it.

18:21.808 --> 18:24.352
There's no way you could
have survived that explosion.

18:24.519 --> 18:27.105
- How did you get out?
- That's my little riddle.

18:27.355 --> 18:29.024
Please, you must tell me.

18:30.066 --> 18:32.986
All right, you win.
You tell me what I wanna know

18:33.069 --> 18:36.323
and I'll tell you
what you wanna know. Okay?

18:37.991 --> 18:40.702
You mean, where you've hidden
everything you've stolen?

18:41.161 --> 18:45.206
Certainly. I'll even tell you
how I committed all those robberies.

18:45.373 --> 18:46.374
Deal?

18:47.751 --> 18:48.793
No-

18:51.421 --> 18:53.381
- Did you get that?
- We got it.

18:57.927 --> 19:00.388
This ought to be enough
to prove a parole violation.

19:00.472 --> 19:04.184
You're going away for good this time.
All right, get him out of here.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.567
My compliments.
This is a great little idea.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.779
Wait a minute.
Aren't you gonna tell me how you did it?

19:16.154 --> 19:17.447
That's not fair!

19:25.872 --> 19:27.916
His accomplices
plea-bargained immediately.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.918
Told the police where
all the stolen goods were

19:30.085 --> 19:32.671
and even agreed to
testify against Nygma.

19:32.879 --> 19:36.216
But what I don't get is,
how did you escape from that explosion?

19:38.468 --> 19:39.636
Well...

19:42.847 --> 19:44.724
<i>All the exits were blocked.</i>

19:47.894 --> 19:51.231
<i>And I was out of time.
There was only one thing to do.</i>

19:51.981 --> 19:53.483
<i>I jumped inside the safe.</i>

20:00.073 --> 20:01.616
Nice going, Bruce.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.702
Man, I'd have never thought of that.

20:03.910 --> 20:05.245
Neither would the Riddler.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.000
It's impossible, I tell you!

20:11.167 --> 20:13.837
Impossible! My trap was perfect!

20:14.462 --> 20:16.005
How did he do it?

20:16.172 --> 20:17.549
I have to know!

20:17.716 --> 20:20.176
Somebody tell me! It's not fair!

20:20.260 --> 20:22.220
There was no way, I tell you!

20:22.387 --> 20:26.266
No way he could have gotten out!
Somebody tell me!

20:26.349 --> 20:30.228
Do you hear me?
Somebody tell me how he did it!

20:30.520 --> 20:32.355
I have to know!
