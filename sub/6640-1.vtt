Oh , come on now.

It will help you make more
of a down payment for this place.

Man , Willie, you know
I'm better under the hood

03:50.814 --> 03:52.190

Pay is good . Now she's a good client.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.364
And she pays well . I don't want to lose her.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.032

- You'll think what?

04:01.116 --> 04:02.826

Okay.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.543

06:29.806 --> 06:31.683

06:46.864 --> 06:49.409
You know, Ms. Kat, you know
you got to take care of that cough .

06:49.492 --> 06:53.663
I mean , it sounds like it's getting worse
every time I come up in here.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.831
Yeah .

06:55.999 --> 06:59.168
- Jenny been by?
- That daughter of mine?

06:59.711 --> 07:02.922
No, only time I see her
is when she's driving by.

07:03.006 --> 07:06.342
She ain't been here
to see these girls in months.

07:06.384 --> 07:10.471
So happy you're here, or they wouldn't
know they had a daddy or a mama.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.310
Monty, listen .

07:15.685 --> 07:17.020
Sit down .

07:17.353 --> 07:18.771
What's wrong?

07:23.359 --> 07:27.196
I need you to go down
to family court with me right away

07:27.280 --> 07:30.033
so you can tell them
that you're taking the girls.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.993
I need you to raise them .

07:32.035 --> 07:34.704
Ms. Kat, you know I love my kids,
but I can't take them full time.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.831
Well , then they're gonna have to stay
with their mama.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.375
- Now, you know I don't want that.
- Neither do I .

07:39.417 --> 07:43.421
Especially since she living with that Joe,
the biggest drug dealer in the area.

07:43.504 --> 07:47.383
Sitting up there in that window
staring down at all of us like he's God .

07:48.384 --> 07:50.553
And she's right there with him .

07:51.137 --> 07:53.806
She don't care about nobody but herself.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.894
Do you know what'll happen to them girls
if they have to live with their mama, huh?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.480
God forbid .

08:01.564 --> 08:04.567
- Monty, please.
- Ms. Kat, I ...

08:04.651 --> 08:06.611
I have lung cancer.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.449
I am dying , Monty.

08:11.532 --> 08:15.912
I've been hanging in there for them girls
as long as I can , but I'm tired .

08:17.246 --> 08:18.623
I'm tired .

08:23.544 --> 08:26.673
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you tell me this?

08:36.432 --> 08:38.893
Ms. Kat, it's gonna be all right.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.354
It is not gonna be all right.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.307
Why didn't y'all call me?

09:18.349 --> 09:19.976
- Mommy!
- Don't look at her.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.602
No, wait.
Wait, where do you think you're going?

09:21.644 --> 09:24.939
These are my kids.
Stop. Stop. Get into the car, baby.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.316
- Stop. Quit it.
- No, you get off of me.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.777
Stop it, Jenny. Stop it.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.739
- Everything all right, baby?
- No, you get my kids out of this car.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.283
Jenny, stop it now. Jenny, stop. Stop.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.493
You have not been
to see these kids in months.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.787
- You want to come take them now?
- Get your hands off of me.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.247
You got to be crazy. Get out of here.

09:41.330 --> 09:44.375
- Now, you need back up, son .
- Yo, do me a favor, shut up.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.628
- Do me a favor, dawg , just hold it.
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

09:47.670 --> 09:49.839
Go ahead , baby. Go ahead .
Put your seat-belt on . It's okay.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.466
This is your mother's funeral .

09:51.507 --> 09:54.510
And you know
she wanted these girls to go with him .

09:54.594 --> 09:56.512
Jennifer, you know it.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.598
You out whoring around with these thugs.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.184
She didn't want these girls
around all of this foolishness.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.977
Let me tell you something , Aunt Rita.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.230
All right, these are my kids.
Do you hear me?

10:06.314 --> 10:08.733
You ain't just gonna take them from me.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.486
And let me tell you ,
you go make your mechanic money,

10:11.527 --> 10:14.614
you save it 'cause we going to court.
You hear me?

10:14.697 --> 10:17.867
Give me my kids back.
You're gonna give them back to me.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.371
You stay out of my way.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.791
- What are you doing?
- Think you gonna let my mama die?

10:24.874 --> 10:26.209
Calm down . Come on , calm down .

10:26.292 --> 10:29.545
You gonna let them bury my mama
and you don't tell me, Wilbert?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.380
- You should've been there for your mama.
- That's right.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.466
- You know it ain't right.
- It's too late now.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.887
Daddy, you know this place
is too small for all of us.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.348
- We don't have anywhere else to go.
- We can go live with Mama.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.934
China, Mama don't want us. She never did .

10:43.017 --> 10:45.937
- That is not true.
- It is true.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.773
- Is that true, Daddy?
- I'll tell you what is true.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.192
I want you all to come stay with me.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.860
Where are we gonna sleep?

10:52.902 --> 10:56.155
Well , I'm gonna sleep on the couch
and you guys,

10:56.239 --> 10:58.783
I mean girls,
are gonna sleep in the bedroom .

11:00.743 --> 11:02.495
I fixed it up.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.455
How bad was it before?

11:06.249 --> 11:08.459
Daddy, China pees in the bed .

11:08.543 --> 11:10.211
And I ain't sleeping with her.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.420
I do not.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.714
Why I got to put up
with being insulted like that?

11:13.756 --> 11:15.341
- What's wrong with you?
- Whatever.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.135
We need some separate beds
or some bunk beds or something

11:18.219 --> 11:20.555
-'cause this ain't gonna work.
- Well , I'll work on it, okay?

11:20.596 --> 11:23.432
Well , while you work on it,
how about feeding us?

11:23.516 --> 11:26.185
And getting all three of us some food?
'Cause all three of us are hungry.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.187
You know what?
You got a mouth like your mama.

11:28.271 --> 11:32.024
You need to put your clothes
in them drawers right here. Thank you .

11:32.108 --> 11:33.901
I like this bedroom .

11:48.958 --> 11:50.710
Lord , how am I gonna do this?

12:03.097 --> 12:05.808
Man , I can't believe I'm doing this.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.060
You waiting for Ms. Rossmore?

12:10.771 --> 12:13.524
Yeah . Rossmore. Julia Rossmore.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.777
Good luck.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.572
What do you mean , "Good luck"?

12:21.741 --> 12:24.327
- Good day, Ms. Rossmore.
- Good morning .

12:31.417 --> 12:35.212
- You gonna open the door?
- Yeah . Yeah .

12:41.135 --> 12:43.429
- Can you close the door?
- Yeah .

12:47.475 --> 12:49.268
What you laughing at?

12:56.525 --> 12:59.612
Tell him to meet me there.
Tell him to wait then .

13:00.780 --> 13:04.033
I'm surprised
the jury has returned so soon , myself.

13:04.116 --> 13:08.204
No, it's a great thing . Yeah , definitely.
All right, see you in a second .

13:09.372 --> 13:11.791
Did they tell you I need you to be on call?

13:13.918 --> 13:17.380
- Oh , you talking to me?
- You're the only other person in the car.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.549
Oh , no. You know what? I thought
you were still on the phone, you know.

13:20.633 --> 13:25.554
Well , basically, all I need you to do
is get me to the office and get me to court.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.847
Sometimes I work late.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.392
And sometimes I entertain clients
after work, that sort of thing .

13:29.433 --> 13:32.687
You know what, Ms. Rossmore? Right now
I need all the overtime I can get so...

13:32.728 --> 13:34.689
- I'm sorry. What's your name?
- Monty.

13:34.730 --> 13:38.484
Monty. Look, I don't like to fraternize so
let's keep this strictly professional . Okay?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.236
- Yes, ma'am .
- Fabulous.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.580
Excuse me.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.250
I'm sorry about that.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.097
Are you . . . Am I getting punked?

14:08.973 --> 14:11.517
No, you're not getting punked , ma'am .

14:11.600 --> 14:13.811
I just, you know,
thought you might want the radio on .

14:13.894 --> 14:15.855
- No, I like silence.
- Yes, ma'am .

14:15.938 --> 14:17.106
Silence.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.608
You've missed your turn .
I asked you to take the freeway.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.110
Well , you know what?
This way is much faster.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.278
Excuse me?

14:22.361 --> 14:24.655
Yeah . You seem like you're in a rush
and this way is faster, so...

14:24.739 --> 14:26.782
Yeah , I am in a rush and I know this city!

14:26.866 --> 14:29.660
The freeway would have bypassed
all of this lunchtime traffic.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.162
I cannot believe this.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.790
- Why are you stopping?
- Because we're here now.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.050
- Next time follow my instructions, okay?
- Yes, ma'am .

14:50.306 --> 14:51.474
Ms. Rossmore.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.351
The jury has a question
that they need answered .

14:54.435 --> 14:57.146
They want to know if
the damage award can be higher

14:57.188 --> 14:59.899
-than what was previously requested .
- Well , Your Honor...

14:59.982 --> 15:01.817
How's the driving going?

15:01.901 --> 15:04.445
Oh , look, she is something else.

15:04.487 --> 15:07.073
I know. I've worked for her four years.

15:07.156 --> 15:11.160
She's good though . She wins every case.
And this is a big one.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.579
Settlement.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.916
That means she just won a grip of money.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.667
She's that good?

15:18.751 --> 15:20.586
My client's willing to talk.

15:20.669 --> 15:24.090
Oh , and she's also impatient.
So you might want to get out to the car.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.772
Sorry about that.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.653
Your Honor, the people have no evidence.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.696
- We have evidence.
- That is not admissible.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.033
The search warrant gave them the right
to search the house not the car.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.493
- He's right.
- Your Honor...

15:52.535 --> 15:55.121
The evidence of the drugs is inadmissible.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.290
In that case, Your Honor, we immediately
ask that all the charges be dropped

15:58.374 --> 16:00.042
and that the case be dismissed
with prejudice.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.878
Your Honor, we need to get him
out of the neighborhood .

16:02.920 --> 16:05.047
Then your officers
should have been more careful .

16:05.131 --> 16:08.717
- Where is your eyewitness?
- He has intimidated the entire community.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.178
Then your office
has its work cut out for them .

16:11.220 --> 16:13.556
I'm dismissing all the charges.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.057
Adjourned .

16:19.353 --> 16:21.272
They can't hold me, baby.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.150
- You're the man .
- Thank you .

16:24.233 --> 16:27.403
You want some pizza?
All right, I'm gonna bring some for you .

16:27.486 --> 16:29.405
All right, I'll there soon .

16:29.446 --> 16:31.031
I love you .

16:35.369 --> 16:38.205
- Well , do you see this?
- Yeah , I see it.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.791
I see it.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.835
You looking like a little massa boy.

16:42.918 --> 16:45.421
Wow. So, you had to get yourself
another job, huh?

16:45.504 --> 16:48.090
Yeah , I know feeding them girls
ain't easy, huh?

16:48.174 --> 16:51.135
Here. Let me help you out.
Let me see what I got in here.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.637
Oh , look at that. Here. Take it.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.264
- Stop it.
- Take it.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.600
Oh , so, what, you Mr. Do the Right Thing?

16:57.683 --> 17:00.769
Oh , so, you don't want this money.
It's okay. I'll take it back.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.814
- You gonna leave me alone?
- What you gonna do, baby?

17:05.441 --> 17:08.109
You see that brother right there?

17:08.152 --> 17:12.323
If I even break a nail ,
he will shut you down .

17:12.406 --> 17:14.742
And I'm coming for my daughters.

17:15.451 --> 17:19.496
You don't even want your kids. Huh?
Now, why would you do all this?

17:19.579 --> 17:23.416
You tried to turn my mama against me,
huh?

17:23.459 --> 17:27.630
You tried to turn my kids against me?
It ain't gonna happen , baby.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.467
Yeah , I'm gonna make your life hell ,
little punk.

17:31.550 --> 17:35.137
Look at him , Joe. I think he getting mad .

17:35.179 --> 17:38.474
He ain't gonna do nothing .
He's so scared to go back to jail .

17:38.515 --> 17:41.477
Yeah . Go on , looking like a slave.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.438
Go on , son . Mosey on down .

17:44.480 --> 17:46.565
- Go on and drive the car.
- Come on , now, baby.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.901
Let Stepin Fetchit get back to work now.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.362
- Hey, man . Nice suit.
- Stepin Fetchit!

17:51.445 --> 17:54.782
Look at you .
Looking just like a broke-down slave.

17:54.823 --> 17:58.327
I must've been a fool
having three babies by you .

17:58.369 --> 18:02.289
Oh , please. Yuck.
I'm just disgusted with myself.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.711
- Do you think that's him?
- I think that's him .

18:08.504 --> 18:10.214
- Hi.
- Excuse me.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.007
Is this Ms. Rossmore's car?

18:12.091 --> 18:14.343
- Who's asking?
- Yeah , this is it.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.678
- Excuse us. It's okay.
- Excuse us.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.221
- No, we got it.
- We know her.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.430
- Thank you .
- Okay.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.224
- Thank you .
- Okay.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.767
Oh , goodness.

18:30.317 --> 18:33.195
- Ms. Rossmore, you got somebody. . .
- You gonna open my door?

18:33.279 --> 18:36.031
- You got. . .
- Are you going to open my door?

18:38.659 --> 18:40.869
What are you doing in my car?

18:44.873 --> 18:46.292
It's that time.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.543
- No, no.
- Yes.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.920
I just want to celebrate
winning this case, okay?

18:50.004 --> 18:53.465
-3rd and Peachtree, please.
- I'm gonna have to pass on the blind date.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.301
I knew she was gonna say that.
Didn't I tell you that?

18:55.384 --> 18:57.219
- You're going out.
- I can't.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.972
Do you know what your associates
are saying about you at the office?

19:00.055 --> 19:01.098
I don't care.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.017
They're saying that you need a man , okay?

19:03.058 --> 19:05.686
And that you're taking it out
on everyone at the office.

19:05.728 --> 19:08.689
And they also say that you would be
a nicer person if you just got laid .

19:08.731 --> 19:09.898
I agree.

19:09.940 --> 19:14.111
I don't need to get laid ,
as you so eloquently put it.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.237
Yes, you do.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.656
Look, we have been your friends
since college. We know what you need .

19:17.740 --> 19:20.534
Well , if you know me so well ,
you'd know that I don't like blind dates.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.078
- They all end in disaster.
- Julia !

19:23.120 --> 19:26.957
First of all , I have a very, very good feeling
about this one. I do.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.425
Hey, so, Julia, I heard
you was like a lawyer and stuff.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.261
- I am .
- Yeah , so you got this then?

19:41.764 --> 19:43.766
- The bill?
- Yes.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.729
No, I'm serious, though .
This is a nice place.

19:48.771 --> 19:52.566
I like this environment.
You know, it's gangster.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.778
I feel like, you know,
you could do some things in here.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.407
You know what else is nice?

20:02.451 --> 20:04.787
You got some sexy-ass lips.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.040
I just wanna bite them .

20:09.917 --> 20:14.004
Suck on them . Suck your lips off your face.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.966
Yeah .

20:18.050 --> 20:20.636
I'm gonna kill Cynthia.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.555
You don't wanna mess
with your boy right here.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.432
I mean , if you like pleasure.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.059
Hey! Hey!

20:27.142 --> 20:28.227
Hey!

20:29.061 --> 20:31.146
Hey! Hey, come here, player.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.523
Yes, sir.

20:32.606 --> 20:36.235
What kind of fish is this fillet mignon?

20:39.196 --> 20:41.990
- I'm sorry.
- Y'all got Chinese food?

20:42.074 --> 20:44.618
I'm sorry. We don't, sir,
but how can I help you?

20:44.660 --> 20:46.703
You know what,
just give me some scrimps, man ,

20:46.787 --> 20:50.499
and some hot sauce and some fries with it.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.918
- And for the lady?
- Yeah . You know what?

20:53.001 --> 20:55.295
This water is gonna be just fine.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.923
So we can just speed it along?

20:58.006 --> 20:59.550
- I understand .
- I bet you do.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.260
And your scrimps will come out
right away, sir.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.594
Thank you .

21:03.387 --> 21:05.806
Can we get some bread , man?
We're the only table without bread .

21:05.848 --> 21:07.599
- All the white people got bread .
- I apologize, sir.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.101
- I'll get that to you right away.
- Thank you .

21:11.770 --> 21:13.689
That's a lot of hot sauce.

21:16.692 --> 21:20.112
Well , what do you do for a living?

21:20.195 --> 21:24.032
Well , right now, I'm between jobs.
So I decided I'm gonna be a rapper.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.746
- A rapper?
- Yeah .

21:29.830 --> 21:32.499
- That's something .
- Straight up. Check it out. Look.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.144
You feel me?

21:56.231 --> 21:58.108
Man , I be feeling that 'cause like I just...

21:58.192 --> 22:00.736
- I'm sorry. How old are you?
- Forty, shorty.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.070
- Forty?
- Yeah .

22:02.112 --> 22:05.324
You don't think that's too old
to start a rap career?

22:05.949 --> 22:07.743
Why everybody keep saying that?

22:07.784 --> 22:11.872
I mean , yeah . But, you know, I'm good .
And I got a gimmick.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.916
You got to have a gimmick in this game.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.667
- You heard of 50 Cent?
- Yes.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.711
They call me 40 Percent.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.214
- Check, please. Check.
- They call me 40 P.

22:20.255 --> 22:24.259
No, it's official .
No, this is my proclamation , Cynthia.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.928
- I'm giving up on men .
<i>- Why?</i>

22:25.969 --> 22:28.805
<i>'Cause I'm 31. I've never been married.
I don't have any kids.</i>

22:28.889 --> 22:30.807
I don't even have a cat to curl up with .

22:30.891 --> 22:35.103
And because I make six figures,
I can't find a decent man to save my life.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.147
- What was wrong with this guy?
<i>- Are you kidding me?</i>

22:37.231 --> 22:40.025
That man had no class, Cyn .
No, he had no class.

22:40.108 --> 22:43.237
He was screaming across the restaurant
for some scrimps.

22:43.278 --> 22:46.448
Yeah , scrimps.
I don't even know how to spell "scrimps."

22:46.490 --> 22:48.951
Am I being unreasonable?

22:49.034 --> 22:51.620
All I want is a man
who knows when to hold me,

22:51.703 --> 22:54.540
and rub my feet, and make me feel safe.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.375
Is that too much to ask?

22:56.458 --> 22:59.628
No, sweetie, it's all possible
if you just relax your standards a little bit.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.796
<i>Girl, whatever.</i>

23:00.879 --> 23:03.465
And what's up with the black men
all trying to be down?

23:03.507 --> 23:06.510
All of a sudden ,
everybody's got to be down .

23:06.593 --> 23:09.304
<i>Like speaking correct English
is somehow uncool.</i>

23:09.346 --> 23:13.308
Like verb-noun agreement is just too much .

23:13.392 --> 23:16.562
And if I see another black man over 30
in a throwback jersey,

23:16.645 --> 23:18.480
girl , I'm gonna scream .

23:24.820 --> 23:27.573
- What was that?
- I just saw one.

23:27.656 --> 23:31.702
Julia, I just think you're too hard
on some of these guys, okay?

23:31.785 --> 23:34.329
- You just need to relax a little bit.
<i>- Excuse me.</i>

23:34.413 --> 23:35.664
I have standards.

23:35.747 --> 23:38.750
Yeah . Well , the Pope
can't meet your standards, okay?

23:38.834 --> 23:43.630
And I don't mean to be rude, sweetie,
but I got a man waiting for me.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.841
I gots to go.

23:45.882 --> 23:48.844
No, go. No, go. It's cool .

23:48.927 --> 23:51.972
- Don't hate.
- I'm not hating , Cyn .

23:52.014 --> 23:54.975
<i>- All right. I'm just saying.</i>
- No, my battery is dying anyway.

23:55.017 --> 23:57.978
<i>- Wait, I can't. . . I can't hear you.</i>
- Hello?

24:00.647 --> 24:02.816
- You got to be kidding me.
- I am so sorry.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.485
- You got to be kidding me.
- I'm sorry.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.531
- You're gonna answer it?
- You know what? I got to get this one.

24:09.573 --> 24:12.534
It's my neighbor and she got my kids.
Excuse me.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.745
- Unbelievable.
- Hold on .

24:16.538 --> 24:17.956
You're on company time.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.042
You're not supposed
to be taking personal calls.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.461
What happened? Yeah , I know where it is.
I'm on my way.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.047
Whoa. Whoa. Where are you taking me?

24:25.130 --> 24:26.256
- Lady.
- I'm being kidnapped .

24:26.340 --> 24:28.884
- I'm being kidnapped ! Somebody help !
- Lady, stop. Stop.

24:28.925 --> 24:32.012
- You stop 'cause you're in big trouble, pal .
- Look, lady. Look, I'm sorry.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.555
No, no, no. You're gonna be sorry.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.642
You have a big problem
because you're fired . Fired .

24:36.725 --> 24:38.060
I have a problem right now

24:38.143 --> 24:42.064
and I am so tired of your stuck-up ass
giving me a hard time.

24:42.105 --> 24:45.901
Now, do me a favor.
Sit back, shut up and ride, okay?

24:45.984 --> 24:47.361
Thank you .

25:15.639 --> 25:18.725
I do not believe this.

25:18.767 --> 25:22.479
No way. No way. No. No, he didn't do this.

25:22.562 --> 25:25.774
Excuse me. I'm Monty James.
You have my kids here?

25:25.857 --> 25:28.527
Have a seat.
Someone will be with you in a minute.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.028
- Yeah , I'm still here.
- Are they here?

25:30.112 --> 25:32.072
Excuse me. Are they all right?

25:32.114 --> 25:34.866
- Have a seat, sir.
- Where are they?

25:34.950 --> 25:37.786
Excuse me. Excuse me. Where are they?

25:37.828 --> 25:39.496
Have a seat, sir.

25:45.794 --> 25:48.964
Did he take the keys?
He took the keys. He took the keys.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.383
Fabulous. Fabulous.

25:52.175 --> 25:56.513
I'm just gonna call . . . Who can I call?
My battery's dead . Great.

25:58.306 --> 26:02.477
No, no. Julia, no. You're in control here.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.773
And you're just gonna walk in there
and demand he take you home.

26:06.815 --> 26:10.152
"Take me home, wodey."
No, do they say that?

26:10.235 --> 26:13.029
No. "Take me home, brother."

26:14.781 --> 26:15.824
Yes.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.891
Hey. Look, I try to support
black-owned businesses,

26:40.974 --> 26:43.852
but this is absolutely ridiculous.
Take me home now.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.270
Monty.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.314
- Ms. Rossmore.
- Maya, what are you doing here?

26:47.355 --> 26:49.858
I live next door to Monty, your driver.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.527
Well , he's not my driver after tonight.
Thank you very much .

26:52.569 --> 26:55.697
The next time you wanna recommend
a little car service to me, Maya,

26:55.781 --> 26:58.366
make sure it's not one of your buddies
from the hood , okay?

26:58.408 --> 27:01.077
- Maya, what happened?
- Well , there was a fire and then ...

27:01.161 --> 27:04.706
- Jennifer Jackson , Monty James?
- Yeah .

27:04.790 --> 27:08.502
- Laurie Bell , Department of Social Services.
- Are my kids all right? Where are they at?

27:08.543 --> 27:12.047
They're fine. They're being looked after.
Mr. James, this could have been really bad .

27:12.088 --> 27:14.883
I know. I know. I had to work tonight.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.886
And the oldest one, she old enough
to look after the little ones.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.805
- And I live right next door.
- This is my neighbor.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.973
Well , your daughter started a fire.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.601
Now, I'm sure it was an accident,
and the fire wasn't that bad ,

27:24.684 --> 27:27.062
but if your neighbor had not
broken down the door,

27:27.145 --> 27:29.105
your daughters could have died
of smoke inhalation .

27:29.189 --> 27:32.192
Now we're gonna have to look after
your daughters for a little while.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.568
No, no, no. No, it's a mistake.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.196
It's a mistake that could have
gotten them killed , Mr. James.

27:36.238 --> 27:38.448
Now, you'll get a call about visitation ,

27:38.532 --> 27:40.534
but for now,
they're in custody of their mother.

27:40.575 --> 27:43.453
No, ma'am . No, no. No.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.916
Let me talk to the little one, please?

27:47.999 --> 27:50.877
- Mr. James. Mr. James. I'm sorry.
- Look. All right. All right. Look.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.088
- Go get my kids. Just go get my kids.
- Come on , Ms. Jackson .

27:53.171 --> 27:54.339
Hold on . Ms. Bell .

27:54.422 --> 27:58.009
And my mother had the nerve to think
that you would do a better job than me.

27:58.093 --> 28:01.096
So I guess this, right here, is a better job?

28:01.137 --> 28:03.139
- Almost killing my kids?
- Just go get them .

28:03.223 --> 28:04.933
No, go get nothing .

28:08.270 --> 28:11.314
You know we gonna get custody now,
right?

28:11.398 --> 28:13.608
- I'm gonna enjoy raising your little girls.
- Monty!

28:13.692 --> 28:16.528
- You wanna start with me, Monty?
- Give me a reason !

28:16.611 --> 28:18.446
- You wanna start with me, Monty?
- Monty!

28:18.488 --> 28:20.448
You picked the wrong person to mess with .

28:22.450 --> 28:25.829
All right. Just let me get my kids, man .
Just let me get my kids, man .

28:25.912 --> 28:27.414
Got you , player.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.374
- What did you say?
- Monty.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.314
Is he gonna take me home?

29:01.156 --> 29:03.033
How old are your girls?

29:05.744 --> 29:08.204
Five, seven and 12.

29:10.081 --> 29:13.126
Look, I'm sorry about before.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.920
Are they gonna be okay?

29:18.256 --> 29:21.426
If you don't mind ,
I don't want to talk about it.

29:23.053 --> 29:24.471
I'm sorry.

30:14.896 --> 30:17.399
Yeah . He's walking in right now.

30:19.067 --> 30:21.486
I promise you I'll take care of it myself.

30:21.569 --> 30:25.365
Please. Please, forgive him .
Thank you for your business.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.663
What? I told you I couldn't do it.

30:31.746 --> 30:34.666
I told you , man .
I'm glad she called and fired me.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.918
You feel sorry for them girls.

30:37.002 --> 30:41.047
- Did you get that court date yet?
- Custody hearing is in seven days.

30:41.089 --> 30:44.175
I called like nine lawyers this morning .

30:44.259 --> 30:47.137
They all said the same thing ,
they need more money and more time.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.304
Don't look at me.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.640
I just feel like, you know,
I make two steps forward ,

30:50.724 --> 30:52.434
I gotta make four steps back.

30:52.475 --> 30:54.936
All Ms. Kat asked me to do
was raise them kids

30:56.646 --> 30:58.189
and I can't even do that.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.942
You know, Jennifer and that crack dealer?

31:01.026 --> 31:02.777
They got long money.

31:04.237 --> 31:08.783
You gonna need some help from God
and two more white people to fight them .

31:11.619 --> 31:11.786
<i>So my assignment today is to encourage
your faith by using what Paul said.</i>

31:11.786 --> 31:16.916
<i>So my assignment today is to encourage
your faith by using what Paul said.</i>

31:16.958 --> 31:21.129
<i>He says, "And let us not grow weary
in well doing."</i>

31:21.171 --> 31:26.968
<i>He said, "For in due season you shall reap,
if you faint not."</i>

31:27.010 --> 31:32.432
<i>Now what I'm trying to tell you
is that God is faithful.</i>

31:32.515 --> 31:37.062
<i>And in his faithfulness,
he reminds us that in doing good,</i>

31:37.145 --> 31:38.563
<i>you shall get weary.</i>

31:38.646 --> 31:42.025
<i>There's no sin in getting weary.
The sin is giving up.</i>

31:42.108 --> 31:43.568
<i>Because I'm here to announce to you</i>

31:43.651 --> 31:46.821
<i>you're so close to your due season,
you're about to taste it.</i>

31:46.863 --> 31:51.159
<i>There's about to be
a manifestation of God in your life</i>

31:51.242 --> 31:55.038
<i>and it's not time to throw in the towel.</i>

31:55.121 --> 31:59.709
<i>It's time to lift up your head because
something's about to happen in your life,</i>

31:59.793 --> 32:01.878
<i>and God's gonna ensure it.</i>

32:01.961 --> 32:05.340
<i>The evidence that you're so close
to your breakthrough,</i>

32:05.423 --> 32:09.344
<i>the evidence that you're so close
to your payday and your reward</i>

32:09.385 --> 32:12.514
<i>for walking righteous,
is that you will feel like...</i>

32:12.555 --> 32:14.599
<i>You better hear this,
I'm telling you something.</i>

32:14.682 --> 32:17.519
<i>You will feel like you're about to faint.</i>

32:17.560 --> 32:21.773
<i>And when you feel like
you're about to faint, don't faint.</i>

32:21.856 --> 32:25.360
<i>Because that says
that I'm right there next to my miracle.</i>

32:25.443 --> 32:29.364
<i>I'm right there,
right at the door of my due season.</i>

32:29.447 --> 32:32.408
<i>I'm talking to those
that walked into this church today</i>

32:32.492 --> 32:34.285
<i>with their head kind of hung down,</i>

32:34.369 --> 32:37.664
<i>and just about to give up
and about to lose your faith.</i>

32:37.705 --> 32:40.125
<i>I'm encouraging you, keep the faith.</i>

32:40.208 --> 32:43.044
<i>Stay right there. Don't faint. Hold on.</i>

32:43.128 --> 32:46.714
<i>God is about to bring your due season.</i>

32:46.756 --> 32:50.051
<i>And you need to give him praise,
you need to bless his name,</i>

32:50.093 --> 32:52.804
<i>you need to tell him, "I'm still holding on."</i>

32:52.887 --> 32:56.391
<i>God bless you. God bless you.
And God bless you.</i>

33:09.571 --> 33:12.448
You know how you're working
my man's nerve with that whining?

33:12.532 --> 33:15.201
You think I'm gonna let you
come in between me and my man

33:15.243 --> 33:17.370
with all that mess? You're gonna stop that.

33:17.412 --> 33:21.916
- I want my daddy.
- Well , you ain't going back to your daddy.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.294
- Why?
- Because I said so, that's why.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.921
You're gonna stay right here with me.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.299
And you're going ...

33:29.382 --> 33:32.927
China, you gonna stop that whining .
China, get in there. Get in there.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.513
You gonna stay here with me.
You ain't going back to your daddy.

33:35.597 --> 33:38.975
Now you get in there
until you figure that out. Get in there.

33:40.768 --> 33:44.105
Lauryn , go in there with her.
Go talk to your sister.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.151
I gotta tell you something now.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.945
Y'all better be glad I know Jesus.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.781
How y'all get on my nerves.

34:40.828 --> 34:42.330
Really beautiful .

34:43.748 --> 34:47.335
Selling drugs right out here
in front of this holy place.

34:48.210 --> 34:51.380
Oh , my goodness.
You know what, they need to be stopped .

34:51.464 --> 34:55.426
Janice's son got caught selling at school ,
he said he got it from him .

34:55.510 --> 34:59.347
He comes to school and recruits the kids.
Babies, Monty.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.224
And then he sends them to go sell it.

35:01.307 --> 35:04.185
You know, Monty, you really need to come
to this community meeting .

35:04.227 --> 35:06.646
Monty, a lot of people respect you
in this neighborhood .

35:06.688 --> 35:08.940
And they still remember.

35:09.023 --> 35:12.026
- You should come to one of the meetings.
- I know.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.571
I'm praying for you ,
and for you to get your girls back.

35:16.531 --> 35:19.409
- I'll babysit any time I can .
- I'll babysit, too.

35:19.492 --> 35:23.538
Honey, the Devil never wins,
unless you don't fight.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.415
Yeah . You're right.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.418
- All right, well , I'll see y'all later.
- Okay, baby.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.880
I'm going back in for a piece of cake.

35:36.467 --> 35:40.471
Now, you know, baby. You're old enough
to understand some things. Okay?

35:40.555 --> 35:42.307
All right?

35:42.390 --> 35:47.478
Now, you ain't gonna just be
sitting around here living off of me.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.063
You got that?

35:50.398 --> 35:53.234
Hey, look at me while I'm talking to you .

35:53.735 --> 35:57.071
Look at me while I'm talking to you , I said .

35:57.155 --> 35:59.949
Don't you dare not look at me.

36:03.369 --> 36:06.205
- It's time for you to start your own hustle.
- No.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.915
What do you mean , "No"?

36:09.125 --> 36:10.752
- Are you telling me. . .
- I'm not a hustler.

36:10.793 --> 36:14.047
No, you gonna be
whatever I tell you you gonna be.

36:14.088 --> 36:17.300
I'm trying to teach you how
never to be broke another day in your life.

36:17.383 --> 36:20.094
The number one rule to the game

36:20.136 --> 36:22.930
is never get caught.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.391
You got that?

36:30.021 --> 36:32.273
Now, I'm about to go get a drink.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.567
You want one?

36:39.947 --> 36:42.658
Willie's Garage. Can I help you?

36:42.742 --> 36:45.953
- Hold on . Monty, telephone.
- Yo.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.336
Yeah .

36:55.254 --> 36:56.297
What?

36:59.926 --> 37:02.220
We called her mother
but no one answered .

37:02.303 --> 37:04.889
This kind of thing is frowned upon ,
Mr. James.

37:05.807 --> 37:07.016
Yes, sir.

37:07.975 --> 37:10.978
Sisi , where did you get this from? Huh?

37:11.896 --> 37:14.774
- Go ahead and answer me.
- Joe.

37:14.816 --> 37:16.025
Joe gave you this?

37:16.109 --> 37:18.861
- Who is Joe?
- Joe's her mother's boyfriend .

37:18.945 --> 37:21.197
What is wrong with you , Sisi?

37:21.280 --> 37:24.450
- Did you lose your mind?
- I don't want you to die.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.285
What are you talking about?

37:26.327 --> 37:30.623
He said if I didn't do it, he was going to get
one of his boys to take you out.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.668
And Joe crazy, Daddy.
He'll do it. I know he will .

37:33.751 --> 37:35.086
It's okay.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.381
Hey, didn't I tell you not to call him?
These are my kids.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.883
- Please.
- He has no right to my kids.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.927
Did you give this to my daughter to sell?

37:43.010 --> 37:44.846
- Is this punk talking to me?
- No, I don't think so.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.556
I'll take that as a yes. Look, man ...

37:46.639 --> 37:48.266
Daddy!

37:50.726 --> 37:51.978
Look at him , you git.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.521
- Security, get up here.
- You wanna play?

37:53.604 --> 37:56.524
- Daddy!
- Now. Right away, to the Principal's office.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.651
- Let him go !
- I run this, man .

37:58.693 --> 38:00.695
Ain't nothing you can do about it.
These are my streets.

38:00.778 --> 38:01.904
It's okay, baby.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.532
Do yourself a favor, Monty, live.

38:04.615 --> 38:08.202
'Cause if you keep coming at me
the way you coming at me,

38:08.286 --> 38:11.664
we won't need a custody hearing .
You heard me?

38:11.706 --> 38:13.791
- Stop it, Sierra.
- Let go. Come here.

38:14.333 --> 38:17.211
Daddy's all right. Daddy's all right.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.881
- Daddy, please, can we go with you?
- Sierra, come on .

38:19.964 --> 38:21.090
- Sierra.
- Please.

38:21.174 --> 38:23.801
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

38:23.885 --> 38:26.179
- Sierra, come on .
- Let me go !

38:26.220 --> 38:28.181
Stop it. Both of you .

38:29.140 --> 38:31.601
- Stop grabbing her like that.
- What you doing , Sierra?

38:31.684 --> 38:33.686
It's gonna be all right, Sisi . All right?

38:33.728 --> 38:36.230
Why you gotta come up in here...

38:36.314 --> 38:37.899
If you come up in front of me again ,

38:38.024 --> 38:41.194
I swear to God , you'll never see
another daylight in your life.

39:02.256 --> 39:03.925
- Morning .
- Hi .

39:06.552 --> 39:07.887
Excuse me.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.349
-...and your 8: 00 appointment's all set.
- Okay.

39:11.432 --> 39:12.517
Mr. Farnberg called .

39:12.600 --> 39:15.770
Oh , and I was able to reschedule
your hair appointment for next Tuesday.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.271
Also...

39:17.355 --> 39:20.191
- Hey, what are you doing in here?
- I needed to talk to you .

39:20.274 --> 39:22.276
That's what I was trying to tell you .
Mr. James is here.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.612
Yeah , obviously.
Did you just let him in my office?

39:24.695 --> 39:27.281
Well , he said he's here to drive you home.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.825
- Call security.
- No, you ain't gotta call security.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.286
I don't know what I was thinking
coming here talking to you .

39:32.370 --> 39:34.413
I'll just leave. I'm going .

39:34.455 --> 39:36.457
What do you want from me?

39:37.875 --> 39:40.378
I gotta talk to you about my kids.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.802
- Maya, can you give us a second , please?
- Yes, ma'am .

39:51.055 --> 39:53.808
I gotta get my girls back.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.477
Okay, what you need
is a family law attorney.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.813
Okay? And if you can't afford one,
the court will appoint one.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.523
I can't walk in there with a public lawyer.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.650
Their mama's spending
a lot of money on a lawyer.

40:02.692 --> 40:05.653
And I need a bulldog like you . No offense.

40:06.654 --> 40:09.615
Look, our firm charges $500 an hour.
Can you afford that?

40:09.657 --> 40:12.159
- I got $1 ,200 to my name.
- Look, Mr...

40:12.243 --> 40:14.579
No, no, just call me Monty.
Look, sister, I'm trying to get...

40:14.662 --> 40:16.664
Typical . Typical .

40:16.706 --> 40:20.001
I thought more of you , but it's real typical .
I'm not your sister, okay?

40:20.042 --> 40:24.046
I don't appreciate you coming
into my office asking for favors,

40:24.130 --> 40:25.631
playing the race thing .

40:25.673 --> 40:27.466
It's sad and it's pathetic.

40:29.010 --> 40:31.470
- What are you getting out of this?
- What?

40:31.512 --> 40:33.681
Why do you want your daughters back
so badly?

40:33.723 --> 40:37.852
You getting a check for them
or some sort of government assistance?

40:37.893 --> 40:39.145
Go to hell .

40:39.186 --> 40:42.690
Well , that, my friend , is exactly
how you get what you want.

40:42.773 --> 40:46.944
Insult me. Great strategy.
I see why you're so successful .

40:48.279 --> 40:50.156
Get a man . Get a life.

40:51.532 --> 40:52.867
Thank you .

40:59.582 --> 41:01.292
Excuse me, are any of you ladies
named Julia?

41:01.375 --> 41:02.501
- No.
- No.

41:02.543 --> 41:04.045
Sorry to bother you .

41:09.842 --> 41:11.093
Julia.

41:11.177 --> 41:12.928
- Christopher?
- Yes.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.139
- Please, call me Chris.
- Sure.

41:16.057 --> 41:18.017
- May I?
- Oh , please. Sorry.

41:24.357 --> 41:25.983
I'm sorry for staring .

41:26.067 --> 41:29.153
It's just that you're more beautiful
than your friend said .

41:29.236 --> 41:32.323
- Thank you .
- You're welcome.

41:32.406 --> 41:35.326
- So you're a lawyer?
- Yes, I am .

41:35.409 --> 41:37.953
- Me, too.
- Really? Wow.

41:38.037 --> 41:41.540
Mostly corporate stuff, tax stuff.
It's pretty boring . What about you?

41:41.582 --> 41:44.752
Our firm handles some criminal , some civil .

41:44.794 --> 41:47.421
- Okay. What firm?
- Rossmore & Blake.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.589
Oh .

41:50.132 --> 41:52.551
- What?
- I applied for a job there.

41:52.593 --> 41:54.929
They turned me down .

41:55.012 --> 41:57.556
Said that my resume
was a little bit shallow.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.892
That's what the old fart said .

42:01.102 --> 42:05.606
- What's he. . . How's he doing these days?
- He retired to Florida.

42:05.648 --> 42:09.568
- Oh , you keep up with him?
- He's my father, the fart.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.781
Check, please.

42:14.490 --> 42:17.702
- I'm sorry. That was embarrassing .
- Don't worry about it.

42:17.785 --> 42:21.080
He can be a little tough on people
he doesn't know that well .

42:21.122 --> 42:23.958
Oh , it must be big wingtips to fill .

42:23.999 --> 42:27.002
Actually I try to fill my own stilettos.

42:28.129 --> 42:30.965
TouchÃ©. And I will try to keep
my foot out of my mouth

42:31.006 --> 42:32.425
for the rest of this conversation .

42:32.466 --> 42:34.635
It's cute. You should leave it there.

42:34.719 --> 42:38.055
- Well , if it's what the lady likes, then I will .
- Oh , I like.

42:38.639 --> 42:43.352
- Would you like anything to drink?
- A latte would be great.

42:43.436 --> 42:45.396
Okay. Coming right up.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.152
Thank you , Jesus.

42:55.030 --> 42:57.324
So, I had an amazing time.

42:57.366 --> 43:00.995
This was one of the best dates
I've ever been on .

43:01.078 --> 43:02.329
Me, too.

43:02.913 --> 43:06.417
- I would like to see you again .
- Yeah? I'd like that.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.089
Who the hell is this, Chris?

43:17.303 --> 43:19.054
This is...

43:19.138 --> 43:20.514
Baby, you were supposed ...

43:20.598 --> 43:24.101
- Who are you?
- I was just saying goodbye, ma'am .

43:24.185 --> 43:27.855
Yeah , you better go, slut.
You see, right now, this is his family.

43:28.522 --> 43:31.484
- Get away from my daddy, tramp.
- Junior!

43:31.525 --> 43:34.069
Excuse me, you're trying
to be playing player, huh?

43:34.153 --> 43:38.157
Where is your wedding ring?
That is so tired . Get into the car.

43:43.204 --> 43:46.081
- Where's your lawyer?
- Sir, I can't afford one.

43:46.165 --> 43:48.501
But I do have all my paperwork,
Your Honor.

43:48.542 --> 43:51.837
- Are you ready to begin?
- Yes, sir.

43:52.671 --> 43:54.924
- My kids were taken for. . .
- The court is aware of that,

43:55.007 --> 43:57.593
but first I'd like to hear about the incident
that happened at school .

43:57.676 --> 44:00.429
Your Honor, he gave my daughter weed
to sell in school

44:00.513 --> 44:01.931
so, you know, I had to handle that.

44:02.014 --> 44:05.226
Mr. James has no evidence
to support that allegation .

44:05.267 --> 44:07.895
However, we have documentation
that demonstrates

44:07.978 --> 44:11.148
that Mr. James has a history
of violent behavior.

44:11.232 --> 44:14.026
Your Honor, look, I'm caught between
a rock and a hard place here.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.904
You know, the courts won't help me.
My daughters are living with this man .

44:16.987 --> 44:18.614
You know,
what am I supposed to do right here?

44:18.697 --> 44:22.409
Your Honor, not only are we requesting
full custody with no visitation ,

44:22.493 --> 44:25.246
but also a restraining order
against Mr. James.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.456
He assaulted my client
and threatened bodily injury.

44:27.540 --> 44:29.708
You Honor, this man
is giving drugs to my kids.

44:29.750 --> 44:31.710
- What proof of that do you have?
- Absolutely none.

44:31.752 --> 44:34.088
- Your Honor.
- Ms. Rossmore?

44:34.129 --> 44:36.507
I'll be representing Mr. James.

44:36.590 --> 44:38.926
I'd like to request a continuance
at this time

44:38.968 --> 44:40.302
so I might be brought up to speed .

44:40.386 --> 44:44.056
Your Honor, this has gone on long enough .
My client is ready to put this behind her.

44:44.098 --> 44:46.433
Perhaps counsel might want
to remind his client

44:46.475 --> 44:49.144
that in family court it's not
what's best for the parent,

44:49.228 --> 44:51.272
but rather what's
in the best interest of the child .

44:51.355 --> 44:53.065
That being said ,

44:53.107 --> 44:55.818
I think these children
need effective counsel .

44:55.901 --> 45:00.155
Ms. Rossmore, you are appointed
by the court as guardian for the children .

45:00.239 --> 45:03.951
When I hear this case on the reset date,
I want evidence,

45:03.993 --> 45:07.705
not just accusations and speculation .

45:07.788 --> 45:09.582
This case is continued for 30 days.

45:09.623 --> 45:11.667
Your Honor,
during that time we'd like to request

45:11.750 --> 45:13.127
full custody be granted to the father.

45:13.210 --> 45:14.962
You're pushing your luck.

45:15.004 --> 45:17.047
Full custody remains with the mother.

45:17.131 --> 45:20.551
Father will have visitation one day a week.
Adjourned .

45:24.013 --> 45:26.974
You have really interesting taste in women .

45:28.767 --> 45:31.812
No, that's not the girl I met in high school .

45:31.896 --> 45:33.188
Nope, she's changed .

45:33.272 --> 45:36.984
I think the hood has a way of bringing out
the best and the worst in people.

45:37.067 --> 45:40.154
That's not just the hood , Monty. That's life.

45:40.195 --> 45:42.197
Yeah , maybe you're right.

45:42.281 --> 45:45.117
We had big dreams, though . Big dreams.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.578
Then I guess, you know, reality set in .

45:47.661 --> 45:50.748
Really? What kind of dreams did you have?

45:50.831 --> 45:54.293
I'm a mechanic and , you know,
I wanted to open my own shop.

45:54.335 --> 45:57.004
I'm good with cars, you know.
So that's my hustle.

45:57.046 --> 45:58.839
You should open that shop one day.

45:58.923 --> 46:02.343
Well , I had to use the money
that I had saved on my kids.

46:02.384 --> 46:04.386
- Oh .
- It was worth it, though .

46:04.470 --> 46:06.180
You know, I think that parents sometimes,

46:06.263 --> 46:09.934
they gotta give up their dreams
so their kids can have one.

46:15.022 --> 46:16.523
Thank you .

46:16.815 --> 46:18.776
- Thank you so much . . .
- All right.

46:18.859 --> 46:21.111
...for giving me hope. Thank you .

46:23.572 --> 46:25.240
Great. Cool . Okay.

46:32.373 --> 46:35.668
Come by tomorrow evening after work.
We're gonna have to do all this after-hours.

46:35.709 --> 46:37.544
- Okay.
- And if you could bring any receipt

46:37.586 --> 46:40.881
that pertains to the kids' expenses
or anything else you can possibly think of

46:40.965 --> 46:43.217
-that can help us win the case.
- Thank you .

46:51.684 --> 46:53.435
No, no, no. This needs to be addressed .

46:53.519 --> 46:56.146
He is the councilman .
He needs to know what the real issues are.

46:56.230 --> 46:58.357
You the one we elected .
You supposed to do something .

46:58.399 --> 46:59.733
- That's what.
- That's right.

46:59.775 --> 47:03.445
Quiet, quiet, please.
One at a time. One at a time.

47:03.529 --> 47:05.239
Yes, you , ma'am .

47:05.280 --> 47:09.702
I'm scared to go to the mailbox on the first
because they be watching me.

47:12.538 --> 47:13.831
Yes, sir.

47:14.498 --> 47:17.918
That Joe boy's been selling drugs
on this block for years.

47:18.002 --> 47:21.338
- Why haven't you called the police?
- What good would that do?

47:21.422 --> 47:24.967
He's been arrested five times
and he keeps coming back.

47:25.718 --> 47:28.429
- You gotta do something .
- That's right.

47:28.512 --> 47:30.889
What did I miss?

47:30.931 --> 47:33.434
More of the same. Still complaining .

47:33.475 --> 47:36.687
Let me tell you why
he's gonna keep getting off.

47:36.770 --> 47:41.025
Because none of you in this neighborhood
will testify against him .

47:44.153 --> 47:48.407
What if we did?
I mean , what if we did testify?

47:48.449 --> 47:50.367
Who's gonna protect us?

47:52.911 --> 47:57.666
Police don't come when you call them
in this neighborhood half the time.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.960
- May I say something , please?
- Yes, sir.

48:00.044 --> 48:03.047
I've been in this neighborhood
for almost 67 years.

48:03.130 --> 48:07.801
I've watched Dr. King walk this very street
to go to the barbershop.

48:07.843 --> 48:09.678
I remember Billie Holiday

48:09.762 --> 48:13.932
who checked into what used to be
the only hotel in the South

48:13.974 --> 48:18.645
that would allow black people,
right here on Auburn Avenue.

48:18.729 --> 48:23.525
What I remember most is we used to be a
people that would take care of ourselves.

48:23.609 --> 48:27.654
Nobody never gave us nothing .
We all earned it.

48:27.696 --> 48:31.784
We look at these politicians
and ask that they help. It ain't up to them .

48:31.825 --> 48:33.702
It's up to us.

48:33.786 --> 48:37.873
And if we all stand up together,
then maybe they'll come and help us.

48:37.956 --> 48:40.584
That's the history of us as a people.

48:42.503 --> 48:44.963
We have to get our neighborhood back.

48:47.841 --> 48:50.219
I can see my whole neighborhood up here.

48:51.136 --> 48:53.263
It ain't but five, ten blocks

48:54.681 --> 48:57.559
but it's a whole different world out there.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.979
- And the highway running right through it.
- Monty, I have a question .

49:01.021 --> 49:02.189
Yeah .

49:02.272 --> 49:05.192
When did you and their grandmother
file this with the family court?

49:05.275 --> 49:09.863
Oh , pardon me.
It was like a month before the fire.

49:09.905 --> 49:13.033
- There, see the date?
- Thank you .

49:14.493 --> 49:17.538
So you've been supporting
these children their whole lives?

49:17.579 --> 49:18.705
Yeah .

49:21.083 --> 49:23.877
- What?
- Nothing , you should be proud of that.

49:23.919 --> 49:25.879
That's all I'm saying ,
you should be proud of that.

49:25.963 --> 49:29.758
Judging from these past years' tax returns
and how much you spend on them ,

49:29.842 --> 49:32.344
-it's commendable.
- Don't be surprised .

49:32.386 --> 49:34.513
I mean , I know the world
will have you thinking that,

49:34.555 --> 49:38.517
you know, brothers in the hood
don't look after their kids but...

49:38.559 --> 49:41.145
I know there are some that don't, but I do.

49:41.228 --> 49:43.939
I love my kids. I want them back.

49:46.733 --> 49:49.236
Oh , well , you know, I think...

49:49.319 --> 49:54.283
I think we have enough info here to
begin preparing a really, really solid case.

49:54.366 --> 49:56.743
You know, there is something
I have to ask, though .

49:56.827 --> 49:57.870
Yeah .

49:57.911 --> 50:00.998
Are there any surprises in your past
that I should know about?

50:04.042 --> 50:05.752
Sorry. I'm sorry.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.046
Yes.

50:08.922 --> 50:12.885
Cynthia, no. No, no, no.
I know it's 6: 30. I'm not going .

50:14.094 --> 50:17.264
'Cause I don't want to go
on any more blind dates.

50:18.348 --> 50:22.311
He was a 40-year-old rapper.
No, I didn't hear his demo tape.

50:22.394 --> 50:24.980
Bye. Bye. Thank you , bye.

50:26.481 --> 50:27.608
Sorry.

50:27.691 --> 50:30.903
Why do you . . .
Why do you go on them dates?

50:32.321 --> 50:34.865
- Why do you go on them blind dates?
- Excuse me.

50:34.948 --> 50:38.535
When I was driving you , you know, you had
your home girl set you up on a blind date.

50:38.619 --> 50:42.581
And I'm like,
"Why you need that? You're so beautiful ."

50:42.664 --> 50:45.167
You really want to know?

50:45.250 --> 50:48.128
I need . . . I mean , I need to know. I mean ...

50:52.049 --> 50:55.427
Because it's really hard
to meet a nice black man .

50:55.469 --> 50:57.429
It is. It is.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.806
And when you're in corporate America,
like me,

50:59.890 --> 51:01.808
the people you work with
don't look like you .

51:01.850 --> 51:04.561
And if you're a black woman
that wants to actually date a black man ,

51:04.645 --> 51:06.188
kind of difficult.

51:06.271 --> 51:09.775
No, seriously, and if you want a black man
that has good credit,

51:09.816 --> 51:12.945
actually wants to date a black woman

51:12.986 --> 51:16.365
and doesn't play video games.

51:16.448 --> 51:19.493
- Good luck.
- I love me some black women .

51:31.922 --> 51:33.548
Where's my money?

51:34.675 --> 51:37.511
- I don't have it.
- We can see that.

51:37.594 --> 51:40.055
That's $700, kid .

51:40.138 --> 51:43.809
See, now, the problem is
that comes from queen bee's account.

51:43.850 --> 51:47.020
And as you can see,
she's a little pissed off about it.

51:48.355 --> 51:51.275
Baby, you want to call this one?

51:51.358 --> 51:53.986
- Oh , baby, you're going to let me do it?
- Oh , for sure.

51:54.027 --> 51:55.821
Go do what you do.

51:58.407 --> 51:59.700
Now, kick his ass.

52:01.410 --> 52:02.744
$150.

52:03.620 --> 52:05.080
$275.

52:05.372 --> 52:08.041
- That's a good $350 right there.
- Stop it!

52:09.209 --> 52:10.585
Stop it!

52:10.669 --> 52:12.212
Get him up out of here.
Get him up out of here.

52:12.254 --> 52:13.547
Get him up out of here.

52:13.630 --> 52:16.591
Yo, light up my blowtorch .
I'll be down in about 20 minutes.

52:17.384 --> 52:19.219
What you laughing for? That ain't funny.

52:19.303 --> 52:23.181
I'm laughing at you 'cause...

52:23.223 --> 52:26.184
Baby, he deserves to be beat, okay?

52:26.226 --> 52:29.438
It's a tough world out here
and I'm getting you ready for it.

52:29.521 --> 52:33.567
Ain't nothing given to you , girl .
No, you got to take it.

52:33.608 --> 52:37.237
Now, I'm gonna wipe those
little sweet dreams out of your head ,

52:37.321 --> 52:40.073
okay, baby,
if it's not the last thing that I do.

52:40.157 --> 52:43.410
Now, get your little black ass
back in that bedroom

52:43.493 --> 52:45.704
before I have to smack it.

52:45.746 --> 52:49.416
Oh , I'm about to come in there in a minute.
I got a big belt.

52:49.499 --> 52:51.960
Okay, I think that's enough for tonight.

52:52.044 --> 52:55.339
- So, how's it looking?
- Good , good . I think we're gonna do well .

52:57.090 --> 52:59.926
- Come on , I'll walk you to your car.
- Thank you .

53:01.261 --> 53:04.598
You know what?
I forgot, I let my driver go home early.

53:04.639 --> 53:06.850
Oh , well , you know, I'll take you home.

53:07.934 --> 53:09.436
Thank you .

53:09.478 --> 53:12.105
- Is this how you're spending your birthday?
- It's just another day.

53:12.147 --> 53:13.940
Wow, how old are you?

53:14.775 --> 53:18.195
- You don't ask a woman that.
- I just did . How old are you?

53:18.278 --> 53:20.489
- How old are you?
- Thirty-four.

53:23.492 --> 53:24.785
Twenty-twelve.

53:26.703 --> 53:28.747
Okay. Happy birthday.

53:33.168 --> 53:35.420
What are you going home to do?

53:36.630 --> 53:40.008
I got some paperwork

Who put this couch here?

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.621
Me, too.

01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:12.789
Bye.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:18.419
Okay, I'm gonna call you tomorrow.

01:03:18.544 --> 01:03:20.505
I had a good time.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.061
Hey, sorry I'm late.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:38.356
Where have you been?
We've been calling you for days.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:41.401
- I called you twice yesterday.
- I know, I've been busy.

01:03:41.442 --> 01:03:44.737
- Excuse me. Coffee, ma'am?
- Yes, decaf, please. Thanks.

01:03:51.285 --> 01:03:54.205
- What?
- Oh , hell , no.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.083
What are you talking about?

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:59.210
Only good sex
can make you smile like that.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.337
- Who is he?
- We did not have sex.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.006
But there's someone.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:08.052
- Who is it?
- She's glowing .

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.929
Come on . Give up the goods, girl .

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:12.640
No, no, no.
Because you're just gonna judge me.

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:15.601
-'Cause you two are judgmental .
- Oh , God .

01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:20.273
- Is he married?
- He's not married . I'm not a hooker.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:23.026
- Oh , well , then who is he?
- Then tell us.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.278
Come on .

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:27.822
- His name is Monty.
- Monty.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:32.744
Oh ! Oh , that guy you introduced us to.
He's the new associate. He was so fine.

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:35.747
- No, no, no. His name was Brian .
- How do you know his name?

01:04:35.788 --> 01:04:38.041
You know, he's not an associate.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:39.876
- Do we know him?
- Monty.

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:42.837
Monty. Come on .
We know him . We know Monty.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.297
The driver?

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.800
- The driver?
- The driver?

01:04:48.509 --> 01:04:49.886
The driver?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.973
Oh , hell , no. Are you out of your mind?

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:57.351
Okay, he's supposed to be driving you ,
not you riding him .

01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:01.189
Wasn't it you two ladies who told me,
"Relax your standards, Julia"?

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:04.025
Yeah , to relax them , honey,
not lay them down by the riverside.

01:05:04.108 --> 01:05:06.736
- I don't know about this.
- Where does he live?

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.449
- Edgewood .
- Edgewood .

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:12.784
- Edgewood .
- Edgewood .

01:05:12.825 --> 01:05:16.120
What does your Ivy League background
know about Edgewood?

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.246
Nothing .

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.582
And what do you know about Edgewood?
Nothing .

01:05:19.665 --> 01:05:21.334
What could you two
possibly have to talk about?

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:22.543
They ain't gonna be talking .

01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:23.961
- Cynthia.
- What?

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:26.714
Your client's last settlement,
his baby-mama drama.

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:28.257
- How do you know he has kids?
- Because.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:30.927
Are you kidding me?
It is not if he has kids, it's how many.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.137
- Does he have kids?
- How many?

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.515
- Three.
- He has three children?

01:05:35.556 --> 01:05:37.183
I'm so disappointed .

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:40.645
- Are they all by the same mother?
- Probably not.

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:44.941
Yes, they all have the same mother,
I think, but it doesn't matter.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:48.027
Just be careful , don't fall for this guy.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.904
I'm telling you , he will run up your credit,

01:05:49.987 --> 01:05:52.615
have you in the SWATs wearing
knock-off Gucci before...

01:05:52.698 --> 01:05:55.785
Brenda, relax, all right. She's not married .

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.079
She's just having fun .

01:05:58.162 --> 01:05:59.997
Right? You're having fun ,
you're not falling in love.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:02.500
And she needs to have some fun .
Girl , you need to take the edge off.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:03.709
You do.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.635
- Hi .
- Whoa.

01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:14.053
- Hey, hey.
- You all right?

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:15.555
- Feeling good?
- Yeah , yeah .

01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:17.849
You had fun last night except for the...

01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:22.645
Yeah , I'm fine.

01:06:23.437 --> 01:06:24.897
What are you doing here?

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:27.233
Well , you know, I just thought
I'd come check up on you .

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:31.362
And I realized , you know, you're doing
all this work but you haven't met the girls.

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:34.073
I have them tonight so maybe
you want to come by and meet them?

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:38.744
- Great. Sounds good .
- My place ain't as fly as yours, but...

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.872
- How's 7: 00?
- That sounds great.

01:06:40.913 --> 01:06:42.415
That's great.

01:06:42.456 --> 01:06:45.293
What's wrong with you? You still feel sick?

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:48.337
No. Maya, do you knock?

01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:50.506
Well , I thought I did .

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:53.009
- I have the files you asked for.
- Great. Okay, thank you .

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:55.178
- I'll get those later. Thank you , Maya.
- Well , you just...

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:56.387
Thank you .

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:01.601
What is wrong with you?

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:06.606
I thought we agreed
that we would work after-hours.

01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:09.358
Oh . Oh , I'm sorry.

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:11.277
You know,
you can't just come up to my office.

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:14.030
You know, it's a lot of nosy people and ...

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:17.116
My bad . You know, I just thought last night
me and you ...

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.786
- No, no, I hope you're not offended .
- No, I should have called you .

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.041
- You understand , right?
- Yeah .

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:29.879
- Great. Okay.
- All right, cool .

01:07:29.962 --> 01:07:32.632
- Great.

01:07:32.673 --> 01:07:34.133
- Okay.
- You look good .

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:35.635
Thank you for that.

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:41.557
Damn it.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:05.081
- So, your dad went to go get dinner?
- Yes.

01:08:06.999 --> 01:08:09.043
Is it. . . Is it far?

01:08:11.837 --> 01:08:13.005
Maybe.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:20.011
- So, you have to be. . .
- Don't come up in here like you know us.

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.139
Oh , goodness.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:26.769
I'm Lauryn and these are my sisters,
Sierra and China.

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:30.564
- Where did you meet my daddy at?
- We met at work.

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:34.734
I think you guys saw me in court
the other day. Remember?

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.947
- Oh , court? That was you?
- Yeah .

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:40.073
You look so much older.

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:46.956
- What did you say your name was again?
- Julia.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.835
- Ain't that a white-girl name?
- Okay, now, we're supposed to be nice...

01:08:50.876 --> 01:08:52.044
China.

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:54.880
...and say thank you for helping my daddy
try to get custody of us.

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:56.549
Oh , it's no problem , really.

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:58.968
Well , you could try a little harder.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:01.511
I've been having migraines
since I've been living there.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:03.055
- Migraines?
- Bad migraines.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.015
- I'm sorry. I'm trying .
- Really bad migraines.

01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:06.475
- Hey.

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:08.310
- Yeah .
- Hey, Daddy.

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:13.274
Yeah , your kids
are certainly gonna be lawyers

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.401
'cause they sure as heck
grilled the hell out of me.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.319
I bet they did .

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:20.156
- Hi , girls. What you doing?
- Nothing .

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:26.412
And she's at school ,
but she is not a nice girl at all .

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:27.830
- No?
- No.

01:09:27.912 --> 01:09:30.332
- Are you a nice lady?
- I try to be.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.086
I like your hair. Don't you , Sisi?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:36.756
It's all right.

01:09:37.214 --> 01:09:39.091
Looks like a weave to me.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.426
- No, it's not.
- Sierra.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.261
- What?
- So rude.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.430
She's so rude. Are you okay, Daddy?

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:48.017
- I think it's time for y'all to go to bed .
- No, please.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.394
- Not yet.
- Just five more minutes, not yet.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:51.687
- Good night.
- No.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.898
- Please, I want to talk to Ms. Julia.
- Say good night.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:55.649
- Good night, Ms. Julia.
- Thank you .

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.401
Good night.

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:59.570
- Good night.
- Sierra.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:02.615
Bye.

01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:05.034
Bye.

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:07.870
Tell me what you know.

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:11.832
You know what?
I'll tell you what I do know.

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:16.796
I know that you , you're feeling me,
but you won't let yourself go there

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:20.549
because you care more about what
people think than your own happiness.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:21.634
Am I right?

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:24.387
We could both act like, you know,
the other night never happened .

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:26.430
- But we both know it did .
- I was drunk.

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:27.973
- No, no.
- No, I was drunk.

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:32.061
You was being yourself and like my
mama used to say, God rest her soul ,

01:10:32.144 --> 01:10:34.480
"A drunk man never tells no tales."

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.024
What?

01:10:38.442 --> 01:10:39.777
- TouchÃ©.
- Yeah .

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:44.156
- So your mom passed?
- Yeah .

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:47.785
- My mom passed .
- I'm sorry to hear that.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.498
- What about your dad?
- Who?

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.835
- Your dad?
- My dad , I don't know my dad .

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:59.797
I got a whole bunch of brothers and sisters
that I don't know, but that's cool .

01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:03.968
It's funny how life works out.

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:08.139
You never knew your dad ,
but my dad would have killed for a boy.

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.557
- For a boy?
- For a boy.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.767
- Didn't get one.
- I know the feeling .

01:11:12.726 --> 01:11:15.354
That man pushed me so hard , God .

01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:21.944
I made partner in the firm before I was 28.

01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:24.488
My parents have retired to South Beach .

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.534
I don't know, Ms. Julia. You know what?

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:31.912
You and I ,
we come from two different worlds but...

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:34.832
Well , there is something
going on here, right?

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:44.008
- You want me to stop?
- No.

01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:45.384
- No?
- No.

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:56.562
- Oh , you're on time today.
- Well , he's on time all right.

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:58.022
Oh , my God !

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:04.945
- What happened to you?
- Some thugs tried to break in here.

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:09.241
I fought them out.
Before that happened one of them cut me.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:11.035
- Are you all right?
- Yeah , yeah , I'm all right.

01:12:11.076 --> 01:12:12.536
Did you catch them?

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:16.415
No, it was just some crackhead
trying to get some stuff.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:21.545
Yeah , I'm getting too old for this, man .
I'm tired of it.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:22.922
They win !

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:26.926
You know, I was thinking .

01:12:29.261 --> 01:12:33.265
I gotta get rid of this place.
I gotta leave this neighborhood .

01:12:34.266 --> 01:12:37.937
So if you can get together what you can
for a down payment,

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:41.607
and then you hit me up once a month

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:44.109
until we reach 10, plus interest

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:48.572
you can have this place.
Would you do that?

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:52.076
I mean , sure. What are you saying?
Are you serious, man?

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:55.788
Yeah , this place is officially yours.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:00.584
- I mean , I didn't want it like this.
- Me, neither.

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:07.800
But you gotta let me come back
and help you from time to time.

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.969
Any time you're ready, man .

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.472
All right.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:15.099
Oh , man .

01:13:23.315 --> 01:13:24.984
Congratulations.

01:13:27.319 --> 01:13:30.739
- Is he gonna be all right?
- He'll be fine.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:36.161
You see that?

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:41.500
I see it. Oh , look at that.

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:44.878
- Can you see it, Ms. Julia?
- I do. Wow.

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:49.967
So, you know, I'm mad excited .

01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:52.469
I'm gonna get my sign for my new garage.

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:53.804
- I know.
- I know.

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:57.182
- Sounds great.
- I know. I'm really excited about that.

01:13:58.183 --> 01:13:59.560
Congratulations.

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:02.938
- Julia?
- Hey.

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:05.357
Hey. What are you doing here?

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:09.403
- Nothing , we were just. . .
- I'm Monty.

01:14:10.195 --> 01:14:12.823
- I remember you .
- Okay.

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:16.660
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah .

01:14:18.078 --> 01:14:21.206
- What are you doing with this man?
- What? We're just hanging out.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:24.209
Are you serious? You like him?

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:28.047
- He's a nice guy.
- Snap out of it, Julia.

01:14:28.088 --> 01:14:31.383
You are a partner at your firm ,
the only black woman at that level .

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.594
What do you think your partners
would think if they knew

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:36.096
you were sleeping around with the help?

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.557
Are you trying to ruin your life?

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:42.061
- Hey, Julia, how you doing?
- Good , how you doing?

01:14:42.102 --> 01:14:44.271
- Hey, baby, you ready?
- Yeah .

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.698
Come on , guys.

01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:12.675
I think there'll be some people
who are disappointed in me behind this.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:19.223
I mean , you know who I am .
I'm from the streets.

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:23.060
- I can't change that.
- I'm not trying to change you .

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:24.937
- Do I embarrass you?
- No !

01:15:24.978 --> 01:15:27.856
I mean , it's obvious that I do.
And that's okay. That's okay.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.109
You just gotta tell me that.

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:34.029
Tell me the truth ,
so that way I know how to deal with it.

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:37.116
Look, I don't know how I feel . Okay?

01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:38.826
But I can't sit here and lie to you ,

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:42.955
and say that I don't think about
who you are and what you have.

01:15:42.996 --> 01:15:44.331
I do.

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:46.583
You have three daughters,

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:49.044
one of whom is almost as big as I am .

01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:54.633
This is new for me, Monty,
and it's different, and I'm trying .

01:15:55.175 --> 01:15:58.387
I am trying
and you gotta give me credit for that.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.978
Can we finish this conversation? Come on .

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.481
- No.
- No? What are you . . . What...

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.483
I got my girls for like two more hours,

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:13.986
and I'm not gonna waste my time
dealing with this.

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.321
But I will tell you something .

01:16:18.031 --> 01:16:20.409
You don't have three girls in your life.

01:16:20.492 --> 01:16:22.870
- It's just you .
- Monty. Monty.

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:25.539
- Monty.
- Big guy, ain't he?

01:16:26.039 --> 01:16:27.833
- He's so pretty.
- Pretty?

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:34.715
- Look at that one.
- That one's bigger than all of them .

01:16:35.632 --> 01:16:36.925
Yeah .

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:53.358
I told him ,
"Do not bring this chick to my house."

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:01.950
- Watch the seat belt. Come on .
- I love you , Daddy.

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:07.456
- See you later.
- Come on , y'all . Hurry up.

01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:10.292
- Bye, Ms. Julia.
- All right.

01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:18.801
I love y'all . Okay? Y'all be good , okay?

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:21.553
- Little butterfly. Go ahead .
- Come on , y'all .

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:28.477
Come on , y'all . Hurry up.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.230
Shoot, I've been standing out here
all night. I'm tired , too.

01:17:31.271 --> 01:17:33.899
Y'all think y'all the only ones tired? Shoot.

01:17:40.405 --> 01:17:43.909
Just let me explain , Monty.

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:53.544
The last man that I loved ,
he hurt me to my soul .

01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:57.464
We were together six years,

01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:02.761
and he told me it was over
two days before his wedding .

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:06.807
I trusted him with everything .

01:18:08.058 --> 01:18:13.772
And I've never felt so low
and stupid and humiliated in my life.

01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:19.152
And so I told myself
not to think about you .

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:23.824
But I couldn't 'cause I do all the time.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.078
So what are you saying?

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.832
I'm saying that I've been running
from something that already happened .

01:18:31.915 --> 01:18:35.002
And I'm saying that
I fell in love with you , Monty James.

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:37.629
And I'm saying
that I hope I'm not in this alone.

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:39.047
You're not.

01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:41.300
You're not alone.

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:46.805
Come here.

01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:57.357
Your Honor,
the children's own grandmother,

01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:00.652
their maternal grandmother at that,
went down to Child Welfare

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:02.070
and prepared a written statement

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:04.323
as to why the children
should be placed with their father.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:06.325
Let me see that.

01:19:06.366 --> 01:19:08.785
- Did you know about this?
- Look, I don't know nothing about this.

01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:10.579
I don't know
what they're trying to pull now.

01:19:10.662 --> 01:19:13.665
Your Honor, my client has the means
to take care of these girls.

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:15.000
And she wants to take care...

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:17.961
It says here that her mother thought
the means were ill-gotten .

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:21.006
- Well , that's pure. . .
- What do you do for a living , Ms. Jackson?

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:24.843
Well , I don't work, Your Honor,
but my boyfriend does.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:26.178
What does he do?

01:19:26.219 --> 01:19:28.764
You know, I mean ,
he owns his own businesses.

01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:30.766
And where are the tax returns?

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:32.559
Well , you know,
we was working on getting them .

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:35.187
And you know what, Your Honor,
you keep asking me about my stuff,

01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:37.522
you need to be asking Monty
about some of his secrets

01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:38.857
'cause he got a whole lot of them .

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:40.609
What is she talking about?

01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:46.281
Your Honor, Mr. James was convicted of
the rape of a 16-year-old girl 16 years ago.

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:48.700
And we're afraid
for the safety of the children .

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:51.662
Counselor,
what do you have to say about this?

01:19:53.538 --> 01:19:55.582
I wasn't aware, Your Honor.

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:58.919
It's right here in black and white.
Yeah , he was sentenced to eight years.

01:19:59.002 --> 01:20:01.964
He's been on probation
ever since his release.

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:03.924
I'll take this matter under advisement.

01:20:04.007 --> 01:20:06.760
I need to review
the circumstances of this case.

01:20:06.843 --> 01:20:08.178
Adjourned .

01:20:11.848 --> 01:20:16.269
So how long has he been screwing you?
Huh? 'Cause I know he can't afford you .

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:19.064
- Move, move.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:20.899
I'll have to tap that ass.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:22.818
Let me explain . Let me explain something .

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:24.152
- Get away from me.
- Hold on .

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:25.654
- Let me. . .
- Get you hands off of me.

01:20:25.737 --> 01:20:27.239
- Wait, let me explain .
- You know what, shut up.

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:30.325
Shut the hell up.
I can't even stand to look at you , right now.

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:33.537
I asked you if there were any surprises.
You said no.

01:20:33.578 --> 01:20:34.705
You're a rapist.

01:20:34.746 --> 01:20:36.832
You don't think that's something
that I should have known about?

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.750
- Let me explain .
- Don't you touch me.

01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:40.877
Julia, look. Look. Look.

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:44.131
Let me ask you a question .
Did you or did you not go to jail for rape?

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:46.383
- Julia, look. Julia, look.
- Did you go to jail?

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:48.427
- Did you go to jail for rape, Monty?
- Yes.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.594
That's all I need to know.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.514
Do you know what, it doesn't even matter
'cause you're a liar, Monty.

01:20:52.597 --> 01:20:56.143
You're a filthy. . . God , you're a filthy liar.

01:20:56.226 --> 01:21:00.939
This case is over. Maya will call you
and tell you when to return for the ruling .

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:04.943
You don't need me anymore, Monty,
and I certainly don't need you .

01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:17.039
So, you like him that much?

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:20.584
- I fell in love with him .
- Oh , Julia.

01:21:21.668 --> 01:21:25.630
Sweetie, this was supposed to be
a fun thing , not a love thing .

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:27.299
I know.

01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:30.552
Go ahead , Bren , tell me, "I told you so."

01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:34.014
Oh , girl , you know I'm not gonna do that.

01:21:34.097 --> 01:21:36.850
It's just good that you found out now.

01:21:36.933 --> 01:21:38.810
I'm with Brenda on this.

01:21:39.644 --> 01:21:42.773
Julia, this guy was probably
just after your money.

01:21:42.814 --> 01:21:45.067
He wasn't even like that.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:50.238
You know, you guys, he was a hard worker.
And he treated ...

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:53.241
God , he treats those girls
like they are princesses.

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:55.994
Well , let's not forget he has a record .

01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:59.623
How did I not know he was lying?

01:21:59.664 --> 01:22:03.710
Because he's probably really good at it.
They all are.

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:11.843
It's like I'm hearing it, you guys,
and I'm trying to understand , but I just...

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.137
It doesn't make sense.

01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:16.765
You know?

01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:21.520
And I can't make my brain believe
that it was all a lie.

01:22:26.858 --> 01:22:28.902
Is it as bad as it sounds?

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:33.990
Honey, it's as bad as it sounds.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:39.371
Jules, just do yourself a favor.

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:41.832
Forget about this guy.

01:22:41.873 --> 01:22:44.543
He just sounds like a lot of trouble.

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:48.213
Okay?

01:23:14.447 --> 01:23:16.199
I just want to say...

01:23:34.759 --> 01:23:36.178
It was like that.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.515
<i>Hi, this is Julia. Leave a message.</i>

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.358
Who that?

01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:05.248
What y'all doing here?

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:07.834
What y'all doing here?

01:24:09.127 --> 01:24:10.837
Where your mama at?

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:14.257
What happened , Sisi? What happened?

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.929
Daddy, we don't really care
what the judge says.

01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:21.973
We just want to be with you .

01:24:22.098 --> 01:24:23.558
I'm staying here.

01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:27.812
- How did y'all get here?
- We walked .

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.814
Y'all walked at 3: 00 in the morning?

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:32.651
We can't stay there anymore, Daddy.
I'm sorry.

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.903
- What you talking about?
- Daddy.

01:24:34.986 --> 01:24:37.322
- What happened?
- Joe...

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:42.160
Joe what? Sisi you can talk to me.
You tell me, what happened?

01:24:43.286 --> 01:24:45.372
- Joe keeps. . .
- He keeps what?

01:24:46.122 --> 01:24:48.166
Joe keeps hitting China.

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:49.334
What?

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:52.796
- Where? Come here. Where?
- On my back.

01:24:52.837 --> 01:24:54.339
On your back?

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:58.760
Mama was sitting right there.
She didn't even say anything .

01:25:03.014 --> 01:25:06.851
Hold on . Hold on a second .
Come here. He hit you?

01:25:06.893 --> 01:25:09.688
He hit me because I wouldn't stop crying .

01:25:09.729 --> 01:25:12.524
- Daddy, I was so sad .
- Okay.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:15.026
Okay, come here. Come here.

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:21.241
Grandma told me.
Grandma told me to look after y'all .

01:25:21.324 --> 01:25:23.952
I got to look after y'all .

01:25:24.035 --> 01:25:26.329
So y'all gonna stay with me now.

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:33.128
Y'all gonna stay with me now. Okay?

01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:34.587
Okay?

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:38.008
Sisi , I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:46.349
Okay, you gotta stay with me.
It's gonna be all right.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:52.897
It's gonna be all right.

01:27:20.693 --> 01:27:22.654
Wait, hold up.

01:27:22.695 --> 01:27:26.157
Monty, Monty. Man , come on .

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:28.159
<i>Some girls up in here, man.</i>

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.912
Monty, what are you doing , man?

01:27:30.995 --> 01:27:33.415
Come on . What's taking you so long?

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:35.750
- I'm Monty.
- We know who you are.

01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:37.085
You beat our team .

01:27:37.168 --> 01:27:38.336
- How old are you?
- Eighteen .

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.171
You know, this sure is a nice place
you have here.

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:41.506
You want to see my room?

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:43.216
- So you gonna call me?
- Probably not.

01:27:43.299 --> 01:27:45.552
You're just like all the other guys.

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:47.387
Mandy, what are you doing?
Did he force you?

01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:49.180
- No way. Tell him .
- Mandy.

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:51.850
- Yes, Daddy.
- What?

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:53.518
- Sir, I didn't do anything .
- Shut up.

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:56.271
- I didn't do anything . It was her idea.
- Shut up, superstar.

01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:58.148
- Tell him , I didn't do anything .
- Call the police.

01:27:58.189 --> 01:28:00.650
Tell him , Amanda.
If you don't tell the truth , I'm going to jail .

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:02.527
- Tell him the truth .
- You're ball days are over.

01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:04.112
- You got me?
- I didn't do nothing .

01:28:04.195 --> 01:28:06.197
<i>- Shut up!
- I didn't do nothing.</i>

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:07.615
<i>- Shut up!
- I didn't do...</i>

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:10.034
<i>Get you hands off of me.
I can't even stand to look at you.</i>

01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:11.870
<i>You're a rapist.</i>

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:37.061
I bet you
he won't ever take our money again .

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:41.024
I know, that's right.
Got to keep it straight, Jen .

01:28:41.065 --> 01:28:43.318
You know I got your back, right, baby?

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:45.612
That's why you my girl .

01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:48.698
You know, I want to go see that movie
with the dude with the ax.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.408
No, no, no, it's the chain saw.

01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:52.994
Baby, you know
if we went to see that movie...

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:06.925
Check it out.

01:29:07.383 --> 01:29:09.719
Oh , snap. Load up. Load up.

01:30:14.367 --> 01:30:15.618
Stop it!

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:47.525
<i>There was a near riot today
in the Edgewood community.</i>

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:50.194
<i>Police officers were called in
to break up a fight</i>

01:30:50.236 --> 01:30:53.990
<i>between local gang members
and residents who had had enough.</i>

01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:56.701
<i>Among those arrested was Monty James.</i>

01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:59.871
<i>You may remember Monty James,
a high school basketball star,</i>

01:30:59.912 --> 01:31:02.707
<i>who was falsely convicted in 1990</i>

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:06.836
<i>for allegedly having non-consensual sex
with a 17-year-old girl.</i>

01:31:07.503 --> 01:31:10.131
I'm assuming you have
admissible evidence this time.

01:31:10.214 --> 01:31:11.382
Yes, Your Honor.

01:31:11.424 --> 01:31:14.052
The police seized
several pounds of marijuana,

01:31:14.093 --> 01:31:15.720
hidden in the defendant's vehicle.

01:31:15.803 --> 01:31:17.138
Subsequent search of the residence

01:31:17.221 --> 01:31:20.141
turned up several kilograms
of crack cocaine.

01:31:20.224 --> 01:31:22.060
This time, Your Honor,
we have a valid warrant.

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:25.229
Your Honor, even though
they served a search warrant,

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:27.523
they still have no witnesses.

01:31:31.402 --> 01:31:34.155
Your Honor, I'll testify.

01:31:57.345 --> 01:32:00.890
Congratulations,
it looks like you have a case.

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:04.977
Take them into custody.
There will be no bond .

01:32:05.061 --> 01:32:06.813
- Next case.
- Wait, get your hands off of me.

01:32:06.896 --> 01:32:09.774
The State of Georgia versus Monty James.

01:32:12.652 --> 01:32:17.782
Order. Order in this court!
All of you , quiet, or I'll have you removed .

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:20.201
I will have order.

01:32:22.495 --> 01:32:24.080
Order.

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:25.665
Order.

01:32:25.748 --> 01:32:27.458
I said order!

01:32:28.668 --> 01:32:31.754
- Who's here for the defense?
- I am , Your Honor.

01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:34.298
Ms. Rossmore.

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.801
May I take a second , please?

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:38.636
What you doing here?

01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:41.013
I'm sorry, I didn't give
you a chance to explain ,

01:32:41.097 --> 01:32:44.892
and if you don't ever want to speak
to me again , I completely understand .

01:32:44.976 --> 01:32:46.561
Let me help you .

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.980
Monty, just let me help you .

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:51.107
Just get me back to my kids.

01:32:52.692 --> 01:32:54.318
Ms. Rossmore?

01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:59.365
Your Honor, there's no evidence
my client committed any criminal act.

01:32:59.449 --> 01:33:01.325
The State has no case against him .

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:02.785
We demand a preliminary hearing

01:33:02.827 --> 01:33:04.829
and request the State be required
to show probable cause.

01:33:04.871 --> 01:33:07.874
Your Honor, I'm sure that one of these
witnesses can attest to the fact

01:33:07.957 --> 01:33:11.335
that Mr. James drove his vehicle
into the previous defendant's vehicle.

01:33:11.377 --> 01:33:12.837
It was an accident.

01:33:12.879 --> 01:33:16.007
I'm sure that the subsequent fistfight
was an accident also there, Counselor.

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:17.341
Where are the witnesses?

01:33:17.383 --> 01:33:19.343
Your Honor,
the entire neighborhood saw this.

01:33:19.385 --> 01:33:20.636
I'm sure we have a witness.

01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:24.140
May I have one of the witnesses
please stand at this time?

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:38.696
- Your Honor. . .
- I'm dismissing the case.

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:56.255
I love you ,

01:33:58.549 --> 01:34:00.760
and I'm sorry for everything .

01:34:28.621 --> 01:34:32.250
Oh , man . Come on , man .
I can't believe this.

01:34:33.459 --> 01:34:35.545
The whole neighborhood remembered .

01:34:35.586 --> 01:34:36.838
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

01:34:57.859 --> 01:34:59.402
Come here, baby.

01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:08.494
- It's all on you now, boy.
- I love you , man . I appreciate it.

01:35:08.578 --> 01:35:09.871
Bye, babies.
