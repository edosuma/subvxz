WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.671
You thought I was gonna propose?
This isn't an ultimatum.
I just need

00:03.703 --> 00:05.106
to know we're on the same path.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.707
Sometimes I think
I never should've let you go.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.276
Hey, Lynly. You up for another

00:08.309 --> 00:09.177
mani-pedi party?

00:09.210 --> 00:10.244
Y'all are hanging out?

00:10.278 --> 00:11.779
With you
saving BlueBell

00:11.812 --> 00:12.780
and Tansy broken up
with Scooter...

00:12.813 --> 00:14.648
You broke up with Scooter?

00:14.682 --> 00:16.250
Guess the fact that I
burned Tansy's hair off

00:16.283 --> 00:17.785
means I'm still kind of
damaged myself.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.520
I'll call Lavon from Houston.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.521
Good-bye, Lynly Hayes.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.689
We're renting a house!

00:21.722 --> 00:22.556
No, we're not.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.159
Termite house is
for rent or for sale.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.794
We're buying a house.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.696
Seriously?
All in.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.167
(upbeat hip-hop playing)

00:33.201 --> 00:35.303
All right, last set, you guys!

00:35.336 --> 00:36.804
Let's do this!

00:36.837 --> 00:39.207
Now I want you to move it,
hips side to side.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.574
Here we go.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.344
Okay, let's metabolize
that sugar into pyruvate!

00:44.645 --> 00:45.813
Pritchett sisters,
I don't want you

00:45.846 --> 00:47.315
to let that lactic acid
build up!

00:47.348 --> 00:49.283
I thought we were supposed
to be getting funky.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.685
What is she even
talking about?
This is not funky!

00:51.719 --> 00:55.789
This Health and Wellness Month
is an inspired idea.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.826
The town really
needed this. I mean,

00:58.859 --> 01:00.161
look at all
the participation!

01:00.194 --> 01:01.729
See? Yeah. I know.

01:01.762 --> 01:05.099
BlueBell, we are set
to meet our goal

01:05.132 --> 01:07.601
of losing 500
collective pounds.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.370
I think this is the greatest
accomplishment I've had

01:09.403 --> 01:11.839
as this town's physician.
Plus, all this working out,

01:11.872 --> 01:13.341
it's really good stress relief
from the big move.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.109
All right, we can stop.
We can stop.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.644
I'm so happy
for you and Joel.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.747
This is such a big step.
Yeah, thanks.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.782
I can't wait for the house to be
ready to have you guys over.

01:21.815 --> 01:22.516
(chuckles)

01:22.550 --> 01:24.818
All right, BlueBell,
well done!

01:24.852 --> 01:28.589
Remember, two days
until the final weigh-in,

01:28.622 --> 01:30.158
all right?
We got Bollywood Boogie

01:30.191 --> 01:31.125
at the Rammer
Jammer at 3:00,

01:31.159 --> 01:32.860
and then right here
at 4:30, we got Pilates.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.728
Meatball, I am
looking at you.
No way.

01:34.762 --> 01:38.332
A rock-hard core
would sully my brand.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.342
JOEL:
Okay, so,

01:48.376 --> 01:50.344
tell me what you thought.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.613
Don't worry.
I take criticism very well.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.881
Let me preface this

01:53.914 --> 01:55.683
by saying that I am,
without a doubt,

01:55.716 --> 01:57.685
the number one
Joel Stephens fan in the world.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.220
Nay, the universe.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.454
And I am so honored
that you would

02:00.488 --> 02:01.822
let me read the first
six chapters.

02:01.855 --> 02:02.890
They were amazing,

02:02.923 --> 02:04.725
thoughtful, riveting.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.227
Wow. Thank you very much.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.728
The only thing is...

02:07.761 --> 02:09.930
Oh. The motivation gets a little
muddled in chapter four...

02:09.963 --> 02:12.733
Your main character
makes no sense. (chuckles)

02:12.766 --> 02:14.735
Well, uh...

02:14.768 --> 02:17.838
Well, he-he is...
he's purposely enigmatic.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.473
You know,
he's a Southern badass,

02:19.507 --> 02:21.242
um, a lone wolf.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.911
Yeah. That's-that's
what's so confusing.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.447
You see, for a cowboy,
he spends a lot of time

02:26.480 --> 02:28.382
whining about getting
his sneakers dirty.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.950
(chuckles)
And, uh,

02:29.983 --> 02:32.453
I-I don't think
badasses use words

02:32.486 --> 02:34.922
like, uh... "ennui."

02:34.955 --> 02:38.926
Well, he happens to be a highly
educated Southern badass.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.929
Maybe... you should change
the character

02:41.962 --> 02:43.664
into someone
you get a little...

02:43.697 --> 02:44.898
better, and leave

02:44.932 --> 02:47.701
the cowboy writing
to actual cowboys.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.273
Thank you for your feedback.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.942
This is good stuff. I appreciate
it. So, I'm just gonna take that

02:54.975 --> 02:58.512
and, uh, I'm gonna let it, um...

02:58.546 --> 02:59.547
Uh...

03:02.383 --> 03:05.853
(sighs)
Artists. So sensitive.

03:07.821 --> 03:08.789
(gasps)

03:08.822 --> 03:10.924
A.B., there you are.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.826
Huge news.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.429
Jackson finally proposed
last night.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.432
Isn't she a beauty?

03:18.466 --> 03:20.968
Jackson proposed?

03:22.436 --> 03:24.538
Wow.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.240
I'm so happy for y'all.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.309
Now, I know you're no longer
a Belle, but still...

03:28.342 --> 03:30.311
will you be a bridesmaid?

03:30.344 --> 03:31.979
It just wouldn't be the same
without you and Lemon there,

03:32.012 --> 03:33.347
and she already said yes.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.849
That sounds great!

03:35.883 --> 03:37.418
Yay.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.819
Bridesmaid, of course.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.921
Oh, great. Well, I got to run.

03:40.954 --> 03:44.425
I'm deciding between Bali
and Brazil for the honeymoon.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.759
(chuckles)
Ta!

03:50.030 --> 03:51.999
Damn health week!

03:52.032 --> 03:54.234
My kingdom for a cruller.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.905
(indistinct chatter)

04:01.475 --> 04:03.311
One veggie lovers omelet

04:03.344 --> 04:05.446
(quietly):
and some bacon I got
on the black market.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.348
(quietly):
Score. Thank you.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.016
Nope. You're on
the stupid diet

04:09.049 --> 04:11.319
with the rest of us, Tucker.
No special privileges

04:11.352 --> 04:13.287
just 'cause the waitress wants
to ask you out.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.555
No.
(sputters)

04:14.588 --> 04:16.490
Tansy and I are just...
She doesn't...

04:16.524 --> 04:17.491
You think so?

04:17.524 --> 04:18.826
Everybody thinks so.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.793
Look, Tucker, it's been a month
since Lynly left.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.364
What's the holdup?
I don't know, man.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.866
Just, you know, Tansy and I
had a complex history.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.068
We're both newly single.
I j... I just want it

04:28.101 --> 04:29.803
to be the right moment,
you know?

04:29.837 --> 04:32.606
And, plus,
things are still tense, very,

04:32.640 --> 04:35.509
very tense,
with... Lavon!

04:35.543 --> 04:37.077
Hey, man.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.380
How you doing?
Alive.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.581
It's nice weather
we're having out there.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.582
Right?
(chuckles)

04:41.615 --> 04:43.417
Oh. Very sunny.
Yeah.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.319
And I-I heard
it-it might rain tomorrow.

04:45.353 --> 04:48.489
Yes. Y-Yes, I-I hear that, too.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.357
(chuckling):
Yeah.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.458
Yeah, I'm...

04:50.491 --> 04:52.626
I'm gonna go sit over there.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.362
Bye.
Okay.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.865
Wow. That is
tense, all right.

04:57.898 --> 04:58.666
Told you.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.968
Morning, Mayor.
Gluten-free pancakes

05:01.001 --> 05:02.536
with agave syrup?

05:02.570 --> 05:04.004
(sighs)
As much as I'm rooting

05:04.037 --> 05:06.807
for the health of BlueBell,
I miss real food.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.376
Tom's been running off to Mobile

05:08.409 --> 05:10.544
to get fries
in the middle of the night.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.079
It's not good
for the marital bed.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.547
(chuckles)

05:13.581 --> 05:16.917
(quietly):
You know, speaking of Tom,

05:16.950 --> 05:20.954
there's something I want
to talk to you about.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.891
So, Duke, we want to knock down
a few of these walls,

05:23.924 --> 05:25.926
get more
of an open concept feel.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.496
That's just a few
days' work, right?

05:28.529 --> 05:29.963
Yeah. No.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.932
We're looking
at a top-to-bottomer here.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.567
A top-to-bottomer?

05:33.601 --> 05:35.503
Does-does that mean
what I think it does?

05:36.604 --> 05:39.507
Was your inspector
Cooper O'Connell?

05:39.540 --> 05:40.908
Yeah.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.943
Yeah, he's a lazy crook.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.613
(gasps)
Wh...

05:45.646 --> 05:48.616
No way you meant
to put that many zeroes.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.050
Well, you could
always cheap out.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.052
Your bed will probably crash
through the ceiling.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.121
Sleep well.
When can you start?

05:54.154 --> 05:55.856
Hold on a second.
Maybe there's some stuff

05:55.889 --> 05:57.157
around here
that I can fix myself, you know?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.659
He's joking. He's very wry.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.660
It's hard to tell.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.128
No, exc...
I'll have you both know

06:01.161 --> 06:04.465
that I earned multiple
merit badges at Camp Nageela.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.499
(chuckles)
For what?

06:05.533 --> 06:07.401
Explaining the cartoons
in The New Yorker?

06:07.435 --> 06:09.002
No, for woodworking!

06:09.036 --> 06:11.071
And whittling.
Look, Joel,

06:11.104 --> 06:13.574
how about you do your things,
okay? Poetry,

06:13.607 --> 06:15.409
cooking, Jenga.
Leave the man's work

06:15.443 --> 06:16.877
to the men, all right?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.712
Well, thanks
for the advice

06:18.746 --> 06:20.714
and the outrageous,
larcenous estimate,

06:20.748 --> 06:22.483
but I'm gonna be remodeling
this house myself.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.018
Suit yourself, city boy.
Uh... uh...

06:25.052 --> 06:26.920
Joel Stephens,

06:26.954 --> 06:29.690
you are going to be doing
a lot of things by yourself

06:29.723 --> 06:31.925
if you don't get that man
back here pronto!

06:31.959 --> 06:34.061
Are you kidding me?
Pronto!

06:35.062 --> 06:37.631
Hello, beautiful.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.567
Kale and quinoa.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.568
Again.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.136
Only two more days
until the final weigh-in,

06:43.170 --> 06:44.538
and then I am
deep-frying

06:44.572 --> 06:45.639
anything that
is not nailed down.

06:45.673 --> 06:46.907
(laughs)

06:46.940 --> 06:47.908
How's your
day going?

06:47.941 --> 06:48.976
Oh, it's fine.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.044
Tried not to punch
George Tucker.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.179
Succeeded.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.180
Oh.
You?

06:53.213 --> 06:55.516
Elodie and Jackson
got engaged.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.150
After only
four months.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.686
I'm gonna be
a bridesmaid!

06:58.719 --> 07:01.455
Oh, A.B.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.156
Look, I know how this
must make you feel.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.658
Actually, I'm fine.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.193
Truth is, I pity her.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.929
Huh. Well, you say that.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.197
Are you sure that's
what you think?

07:10.230 --> 07:12.500
Lavon, I am fine.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.768
We've talked about this,
we've agreed.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.037
Going back and getting
all upset again

07:17.070 --> 07:18.205
would be crazy.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.508
And I'm not.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.142
So let's just enjoy
our kale lunch

07:22.175 --> 07:23.577
and walk to spin class.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.612
Okay?

07:26.246 --> 07:29.049
All right.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.518
I will not let you

07:30.551 --> 07:32.653
break my house for
character research!

07:32.686 --> 07:34.588
Come on, you've got
to give me a chance, here.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.789
Look, Tom was right.

07:35.823 --> 07:39.092
I need to-to channel
my more primal side.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.761
You know,
my-my badassy side.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.596
And, you know, badasses,
they build stuff.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.664
Oh, my God!

07:45.533 --> 07:47.267
I'm hiring Duke.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.135
No, look, wait.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.603
Just think of the money
that we'll save

07:49.637 --> 07:51.038
if I do the work myself.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.573
You know, and by the way,
it's money that

07:52.606 --> 07:54.241
we're gonna need
because my publisher

07:54.274 --> 07:56.209
is going to reject my book
because apparently

07:56.243 --> 07:59.246
I don't know how
to write anymore.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.582
I will hire him
with my own money.
Really? That's interesting.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.250
'Cause last time I checked,
you don't have any.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.618
What is Brick
paying you

08:04.652 --> 08:06.587
to be his associate?
Two goats a month?

08:06.620 --> 08:07.755
I'll have Brick
make me partner again,

08:07.788 --> 08:08.989
I'll make triple
what I'm making now.

08:09.022 --> 08:09.823
Problem solved.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.024
Well, that's definitely
gonna happen.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.125
Until...
Oh, my...!

08:12.159 --> 08:14.261
Until then, I will
start on the cabinets.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.495
I will kill you if you
touch another cabinet.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.131
Fine. I'll start on the closets.
Same goes for
the closets!

08:18.165 --> 08:19.633
Fine, I'll start on
the... bookshelves.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.269
I just need to go
and get some tools.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.104
Oh!

08:25.338 --> 08:26.740
All right.
You got your Phillips head,

08:26.774 --> 08:28.308
got your
flat head,

08:28.341 --> 08:29.743
got your
combination square,

08:29.777 --> 08:31.745
and that pretty little
lady I call Big Mama.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.145
Ah! Geez!
(laughs)

08:33.179 --> 08:34.181
Did you see that?

08:34.214 --> 08:35.182
I almost gave
myself a stigmata.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.750
Damn it,
Zoe's right.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.818
I can't remodel a house.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.087
I... you know, I'm not even sure
I can carry that tool box.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.556
Look, man, it's easy,
all right?

08:42.590 --> 08:44.625
Literally
all you do

08:44.658 --> 08:45.626
is point

08:45.659 --> 08:47.595
and shoot.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.130
That easy.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.766
You just drilled a hole--
in your wall.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.668
Yeah, it's no biggie.
I'll hang something over it.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.704
(Wade chuckles)

08:57.705 --> 08:59.172
You are a very manly man.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.642
And you are
a very creepy one.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.176
No, I mean, like,
you're a badass. Really.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.712
You know... you know what
you're exactly like?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.046
Wiley Kincaid,

09:06.079 --> 09:07.748
the protagonist
of my new book.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.650
Small favor?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.652
You mean beyond
borrowing my tools?

09:11.685 --> 09:12.820
Let me follow you
around for a month.

09:12.853 --> 09:13.821
Six weeks, tops.

09:13.854 --> 09:14.855
No. No.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.856
That's not happening.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.190
Please.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.059
I need to get inside
this character.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.093
I'm in real
trouble, man.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.095
You know, my book,
my relationship,

09:22.129 --> 09:24.331
my sanity...
they're all at stake.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.635
All right, fine.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.869
I'll let you
follow me today,

09:28.902 --> 09:30.303
for one day only.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.840
And none of this
acting weird crap, okay? Hmm?

09:32.873 --> 09:33.841
What, me?

09:33.874 --> 09:34.908
I resent the implication.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.910
Prepare yourself,
my friend.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.812
There's an 80% chance
you'll be dead by sundown.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.681
Oh...

09:40.714 --> 09:43.116
(car horn honks)

09:43.150 --> 09:45.218
(seagulls calling)

09:45.252 --> 09:47.354
(birds singing)

09:55.228 --> 09:56.664
Promise you'll
put this up?

09:56.697 --> 09:58.331
There's no problem, Crickett.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.633
Just try to
breathe a little.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.668
Okay. Right.
Hey, Crickett.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.135
Don't yell at me!

10:05.305 --> 10:06.940
She seem tenser
than ever?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.742
Well, it's hard
to say with Crickett.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.344
Anyway, Brick, I have
brought you some
yummy spelt bread.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.780
Five grams of
protein a slice.

10:12.813 --> 10:13.814
Five!

10:14.982 --> 10:16.884
Wow. Thanks.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.152
And I was hoping that you'd
make me partner again.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.754
May I remind you

10:20.788 --> 10:22.355
that you gave me
the practice back?

10:22.389 --> 10:23.924
And since
you've returned

10:23.957 --> 10:25.859
as an associate,
I'm making more money,

10:25.893 --> 10:27.795
working less, and I get
to boss you around.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.196
Now, why on earth
would I change that?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.330
Because A:
you still owe me

10:30.363 --> 10:31.198
from the whole
cabaret debacle.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.334
And B: I deserve it.
I'm a great worker.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.769
This whole Health
and Wellness Month?

10:35.803 --> 10:36.937
My idea.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.707
And we have already almost lost
our 500 collective pounds.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.274
You said it couldn't
be done, not without

10:41.308 --> 10:43.210
a lot of amputations.
It can't, Zoe, bec...

10:43.243 --> 10:44.978
Oh, why? Because
it wasn't your idea?

10:45.012 --> 10:47.147
No, if you would just
listen to me, I'll explain

10:47.180 --> 10:48.415
why it can't happen.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.317
Ugh. Men so stubborn
and impossible.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.318
You know what?

10:51.351 --> 10:53.286
Let's make a wager.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.888
I get the town
to their goal weight,

10:54.922 --> 10:56.757
you give me my half
of the practice back.

10:56.790 --> 11:00.861
And if you lose, you work
every weekend for six months.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.696
You're on.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.164
Knock yourself out, kid.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.799
(chuckles)

11:05.833 --> 11:07.835
(blender whirrs)

11:09.970 --> 11:12.172
Hey, Maybelline,
is that a new apron?

11:12.205 --> 11:13.907
'Cause my goodness,
it brings out your eyes.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.308
Well, good morning,
you big flirt.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.911
"And as our hero
goes about his day,

11:17.945 --> 11:20.213
he stops
for a nutritious snack."

11:20.247 --> 11:21.715
I made you something special.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.216
WADE:
Oh, my goodness,
you are the best.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.752
Do you mind
putting this on my tab?

11:24.785 --> 11:26.219
Course.
My pleasure, darlin'.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.921
Thanks, sweetheart.
You have a good day.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.457
Wait, you have a tab
at the Butterstick?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.259
The best kind
of tab, too.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.927
The kind they
don't make me pay.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.963
(chuckles)

11:38.231 --> 11:39.967
Oh, well...

11:40.000 --> 11:41.969
if it isn't the bride-to-be.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.971
Hello, Elodie, ladies.
(chuckles)

11:44.004 --> 11:45.472
More big news.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.842
Jackson and I have decided
to have a Mardi Gras wedding,

11:48.876 --> 11:50.510
so we're getting married
next month.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.813
Bridesmaid dress shopping
Monday.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.916
Next month. Wow!

11:55.949 --> 11:58.351
Are you okay?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.287
Maybe it was insensitive of me

12:00.320 --> 12:02.055
to ask you to be a part
of my wedding party

12:02.089 --> 12:04.792
when you're still waiting on
your own beau to propose.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.428
I'm fine!

12:08.461 --> 12:10.964
I am just wondering how
we're gonna fit in

12:10.998 --> 12:13.400
all these festivities
in one short month.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.935
Oh, we will.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.770
Though, Crickett says
she's too busy

12:16.804 --> 12:18.038
to plan my bachelorette party.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.342
You know what?

12:22.375 --> 12:23.543
I'll throw it!

12:23.576 --> 12:25.245
Because I am just

12:25.278 --> 12:27.781
so excited to be
in this wedding!

12:27.815 --> 12:28.782
Y'all free tonight?

12:28.816 --> 12:31.284
I will clear my schedule, A.B.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.519
You are a darling.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.387
I am.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.857
Y'all better get to the bank
and get some singles.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.961
For the strippers.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.564
You put 'em in... Never mind.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.433
Hello, friends.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.869
I'm Don Todd, and this is
my Monster Golf Safari.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.338
This man is a god.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.307
George, I've come
to engage your services.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.544
What are your legal needs?

12:57.577 --> 12:58.979
The mayor has denied my request

12:59.012 --> 13:00.814
to house exotic animals
on my property.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.116
So I need you to appeal it.
Or sue or something.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.018
Not again with
the wolverines, Tom.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.887
Oh-ho-ho, I wish.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.421
Now, three alpacas.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.590
Okay, that's actually not crazy.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.292
Not crazy like a fox.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.062
It's me and Wanda's dream
to have our own alpaca farm.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.864
I've been saving for
months for the pen.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.431
And I've walked Delma's cats,

13:18.465 --> 13:20.000
I've weeded,
Sergeant Jeffries' garden.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.835
I've taken nearly
every odd job in town.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.436
Which explains the sign.

13:23.470 --> 13:27.007
All I need is another
$372 and a license

13:27.040 --> 13:29.009
and for you to take
my case pro bono.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.377
Talk to Lavon for me.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.582
All right,
I will go talk to him.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.918
Oh, awesome!

13:37.951 --> 13:39.920
You are gonna love these
alpacas, G.T.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.454
So soft. (chuckles)

13:41.488 --> 13:43.924
Hey, we'll give you
the first sweater.

13:43.957 --> 13:44.925
Oh.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.593
Oh! That's...

13:46.626 --> 13:49.462
completely not necessary, Tom!

13:49.496 --> 13:51.464
So...

13:51.498 --> 13:54.935
our hero gets
ready for work.

13:54.968 --> 13:55.969
What does that entail?

13:56.003 --> 13:59.873
Well, dirty shirt comes off,
clean one goes on.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.075
But don't tell anybody that.
That's a trade secret. (laughs)

14:02.109 --> 14:05.345
Oh, I noticed earlier that, uh,
your socks don't match.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.415
Is that some kind of
antiestablishment gesture?

14:08.448 --> 14:11.484
The gesture is... one hand goes
in the sock drawer,

14:11.518 --> 14:14.087
two socks come out.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.456
Two socks come out.
This is gold.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.991
(knocking)

14:19.192 --> 14:20.928
Hey, Wade.
Come here, you.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.629
My goodness,
you look pretty today.
Well, thank you.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.397
You better pay that cable bill.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.033
This one's pink.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.500
Yikes. Roger that.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.636
Oh, hey, uh, I got these, uh...

14:29.669 --> 14:32.105
these speakers
that I got to return.

14:32.139 --> 14:35.508
Now, I got a return address,
but I don't have a box or tape.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.510
No problem.
I mean,
you are sweeter

14:37.544 --> 14:39.012
than a box of jelly donuts.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.948
Get out of here
before I eat you up.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.115
(chuckles)
All right, bye, now.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.517
Your...

14:44.551 --> 14:47.120
postal carrier
personally picks up

14:47.154 --> 14:48.989
and packs your packages?

14:49.022 --> 14:50.157
Yeah. How do you mail yours?

14:50.190 --> 14:51.591
I go to the post office.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.226
They still have those?

14:53.260 --> 14:54.694
Yeah.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.496
And two and three
and down.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.131
One and two and three
and down.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.666
One. That's it,
Sergeant Jeffries.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.134
More swivel.
Good job.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.136
Yeah, I've been
working on my form.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.038
BRICK:
Oh, it's a fun class.
Dr. Hart!

15:05.072 --> 15:06.239
My hips are loving this.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.975
You know, the Health
and Wellness Month

15:08.008 --> 15:09.142
was a great idea.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.543
I'm just sorry in advance
you're gonna

15:10.577 --> 15:11.644
lose that bet.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.047
Zoe, good news.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.715
I found a new way
into my protagonist.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.584
I am modeling Wiley
after Wade.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.452
He's letting me
follow him around for research.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.454
Aw, man.
I was gonna read that book.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.689
Yeah, I'm waiting for the movie.

15:22.722 --> 15:23.856
ZOE: Well, good luck
with that, Joel.

15:23.890 --> 15:27.194
Meanwhile, I'm going to be
full-fledged partner again.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.061
So, boom!

15:28.095 --> 15:30.630
Brick caved?
That does not seem like him.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.831
Well, not exactly.
But he bet me

15:31.864 --> 15:34.134
that I couldn't get the town
to meet their target weight.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.536
He's so gullible.
I set the goal super easy

15:36.569 --> 15:38.271
just to help morale.
Yes! I'm back!

15:38.305 --> 15:40.573
Yeah, you're not gonna win
that bet.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.675
I gotta agree with Wade
on this one. Sorry.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.644
(chuckles)
What?

15:44.677 --> 15:48.048
Wait-- that sign is wrong.
Cake Fest isn't for two weeks!

15:48.081 --> 15:49.282
No, the Belles
have been going around town

15:49.316 --> 15:50.717
putting up new signs all day.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.751
Crickett changed the date.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.685
Obviously, Brick knew.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.155
Beautiful day, Dr. Hart.
Sort of the icing

15:55.188 --> 15:57.991
on a beautiful week,
don't you think?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.292
I'll kill him.
I'll kill him!

15:59.326 --> 16:00.293
Easy, easy.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.694
What's the big deal?

16:01.728 --> 16:04.097
It's not like anybody
in this town likes pastries.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.132
(laughs)

16:07.167 --> 16:09.036
I'm sorry.
You know what?

16:09.069 --> 16:12.672
Why don't you just follow him
into the Gulf and keep walking?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.110
Noted.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.557
Hey, Crickett! How are you?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.192
Great. Never better.
How are you?

16:32.225 --> 16:33.493
Well, I'm a little confused.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.096
Why did you choose
to move up Cake Fest?

16:36.129 --> 16:38.631
Don't you know that Health and
Wellness Month has one day left?

16:38.665 --> 16:42.535
The past 29 days, this
town has worked tirelessly

16:42.569 --> 16:45.072
on moderation and
mindful consumption.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.639
And you want to
have a party

16:46.673 --> 16:48.108
where the main
theme is cake?!

16:48.141 --> 16:50.777
Yes, I realize
the timing is unfortunate.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.113
And I am sorry,
Dr. Hart, but there are

16:53.146 --> 16:54.314
things a Belle leader must do

16:54.347 --> 16:56.183
that a common layperson
like yourself

16:56.216 --> 16:58.051
just wouldn't understand.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.620
Yeah. I'm just asking you
to move it back a week.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.090
Dr. Hart does have a point.
Maybe we should just...

17:03.123 --> 17:06.093
Tut! Sadie, if the world
fell off its axis

17:06.126 --> 17:08.261
and you somehow found yourself
in charge of the Belles,

17:08.295 --> 17:09.561
you can make decisions.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.765
But last time I checked,
I hold the glitter gavel.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.267
So what I say goes.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.769
Cake Fest is tomorrow.

17:16.803 --> 17:20.140
But... Damn it, that
cake smells amazing.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.811
(coughs)

17:31.618 --> 17:34.321
Your hovering is hampering
my enjoyment of this cardboard.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.556
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hover.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.191
I'm actually here on business.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.160
Of what nature?
Well, I would
like to formally

17:40.193 --> 17:42.762
petition the mayor's office
on behalf of Tom and Wanda Long

17:42.795 --> 17:44.697
to reconsider the decision

17:44.731 --> 17:46.799
regarding their exotic animal
application.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.102
No.
Seriously?

17:49.136 --> 17:50.837
Lavon, alpacas,

17:50.870 --> 17:52.739
they're harmless.
They don't even have any teeth.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.275
Lavon Hayes is mayor.
Application redenied.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.678
LUCY:
Wade Kinsella,

17:58.711 --> 18:00.580
as my favorite customer,
I've got a bonus

18:00.613 --> 18:01.814
for you today.
Oh, yeah?

18:01.848 --> 18:02.882
Zac Brown Band.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.317
You should take
your new sweetheart.

18:04.351 --> 18:05.718
Hey, Vivian's gonna love these.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.187
You, Lucy, are a gem.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.888
Chuck's a fool
for not seeing that.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.124
That's what I told him, honey.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.725
(chuckles)

18:13.760 --> 18:15.828
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

18:15.862 --> 18:17.597
to get Zac Brown
Band tickets?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.166
Zoe's mom couldn't
even get us some.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.401
Well, I mean, they're not even
front row, so...

18:23.236 --> 18:25.405
Have you slept with every woman
we've met today?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.708
I mean... not all of 'em.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.777
Most.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.679
Yes, yes,

18:32.712 --> 18:34.814
Joel, my young friend,
I have lived,

18:34.847 --> 18:36.716
and I have lived well.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.318
That's all behind me now,
you know?

18:38.351 --> 18:40.787
I got a serious girlfriend,
a real job.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.155
You want a story,
you should have

18:42.189 --> 18:43.356
followed me around
a couple years ago.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.891
Man, that would've been a book.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.359
But now?

18:46.393 --> 18:49.396
I'm all domesticated and stuff.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.231
Pretty boring.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.265
(men arguing)

18:52.299 --> 18:53.700
Oh, man, are you serious? Again?

18:53.733 --> 18:55.635
MAN:
You go there?
You went there!

18:55.668 --> 18:58.738
If you think you can just spoil
 The Sopranos like that for me,

18:58.771 --> 19:00.240
well, you got another
thing coming!

19:00.273 --> 19:02.275
Sopranos has been off
the air for years!

19:02.309 --> 19:03.643
You can't call spoilers!

19:03.676 --> 19:05.912
I know it's been off
the air for years!

19:05.945 --> 19:07.947
What? You think
I'm ignorant?
I know you are.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.916
Hey, hey!
Break it up, all right?

19:09.949 --> 19:11.251
This is a respectable
establishment.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.785
And I know y'all
ain't gonna make me

19:12.819 --> 19:13.953
drag out my speech on civility.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.323
No, no, no need for that.
Come on.
We're good, I swear.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.924
Hey, that's
what I thought.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.727
We all know how The Sopranos
ends, fools. (laughs)

19:22.262 --> 19:23.930
You call that boring?

19:23.963 --> 19:26.733
Are you kidding?
You're a cowboy, Wade.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.402
You-You are a real cowboy.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.938
Well... maybe I am.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.840
(chuckles)

19:36.976 --> 19:40.513
What do you mean, all your male
entertainers are booked tonight?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.249
You listen to me, Miguel.

19:42.282 --> 19:45.818
I expect more from a place
called "The Booty Revue."

19:45.852 --> 19:48.421
Now, so help me, I will come
down there and shove one

19:48.455 --> 19:50.690
of those banana hammocks
right up your... What?

19:50.723 --> 19:53.726
Oh, no, sir,
 you are being uncalled for!

19:55.262 --> 19:58.298
A.B., what's going on
in here?

19:58.331 --> 19:59.466
I'm, uh...

19:59.499 --> 20:00.833
concerned.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.771
Just...
trying to find a stripper

20:04.804 --> 20:09.842
'cause I am throwing Elodie
a bachelorette party tonight!

20:09.876 --> 20:12.412
All right, well,
that's nice of you.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.813
But I can't find
a male entertainer

20:13.846 --> 20:15.515
or a decent venue.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.517
And it just means that this
bachelorette party's

20:17.550 --> 20:18.951
gonna be, like, the worst ever!

20:18.985 --> 20:22.255
Sweetheart, now, if there's
anyone that can put

20:22.289 --> 20:24.291
this thing together,
it's you.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.293
Oh, thank you.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.535
Also, Lavon...

20:35.568 --> 20:39.739
darling, have you ever...?

20:39.772 --> 20:41.007
AnnaBeth,
Lavon Hayes

20:41.040 --> 20:43.009
is a man of repute, a mayor.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.944
Not an exotic dancer.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.379
I say no to the pole.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.752
Hey, Shakespeare,
uh, I gotta head out.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.020
Oh, good, let me just grab
my notebook.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.788
Sorry, amigo, this stop
on the Wade-Along's

20:55.822 --> 20:57.023
gotta be a solo mish.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.558
Vivian just called.
Harley's flu broke.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.827
And, uh, he's got a playdate
with her sister,

21:00.860 --> 21:02.495
which means Viv and I
get a little solo time,

21:02.529 --> 21:04.030
if you know what I mean.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.064
Say no more.

21:05.097 --> 21:05.932
Have fun.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.900
I've, uh, bothered you
enough already.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.438
I'll just call my editor
and tell her that I died.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.906
Dude, we only had
a couple hours left. Come on.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.376
No, really, I really should have
gotten myself a backup career,

21:16.409 --> 21:18.478
you know, like...
like accountant.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.812
People always need
accountants.

21:19.846 --> 21:20.947
Hey, hey, look,

21:20.980 --> 21:23.350
you, you really want to
know what it's like to live

21:23.383 --> 21:25.017
in the shoes of
Wade Kinsella, hmm?

21:25.051 --> 21:26.619
Put down the pencil

21:26.653 --> 21:28.388
and put on the shoes.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.923
I-I couldn't.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.124
Hey, Wanda,
Joel's tending bar tonight.

21:32.158 --> 21:35.395
Anybody orders anything you
don't know, just Google it.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.529
Just Google it.
Peace out, amigo.

21:36.563 --> 21:40.032
Yeah, th-- hey, th-th-thank you
for this opportunity.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.470
(exhales)

21:45.672 --> 21:47.640
Oh, thanks.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.076
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.077
Huh?

21:51.110 --> 21:52.545
(gasps)

21:52.579 --> 21:53.946
Hello.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.082
Yeah, I'm in here.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.351
What's going on in here?

21:58.385 --> 21:59.352
Oh, Elodie got engaged,

21:59.386 --> 22:02.622
and I'm just so happy
for her that I've decided

22:02.655 --> 22:03.956
to throw
a bachelorette party.

22:03.990 --> 22:04.857
(chuckles)

22:04.891 --> 22:06.959
Okay, that is obviously
not true at all,

22:06.993 --> 22:08.861
but before we address
your mental breakdown,

22:08.895 --> 22:10.630
I need you to talk
to Crickett with me.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.064
Oh, why?

22:12.098 --> 22:13.566
Because she moved
up Cake Fest.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.101
I noticed that--
odd choice.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.969
Yeah, that fat and
sugar parade is going

22:17.003 --> 22:18.971
to ruin my Health and
Wellness Challenge,

22:19.005 --> 22:20.607
which means I won't get
my partnership back,

22:20.640 --> 22:23.610
which means Joel's going
to have to remodel our house,

22:23.643 --> 22:26.446
which means Joel will probably
electrocute himself and die.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.080
Oh, that's too bad.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.048
I liked Joel.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.518
You know, I do think
he gets a bad rap, though,

22:31.551 --> 22:33.152
on the message boards
for Dash's blog.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.087
Okay, so will you
help me talk to her?

22:35.121 --> 22:35.988
Well, Crickett

22:36.022 --> 22:37.857
is much more reasonable
when she's tipsy,

22:37.890 --> 22:39.992
and luckily I just bought
a ton of booze

22:40.026 --> 22:41.961
in hopes,
by getting people drunk,

22:41.994 --> 22:42.995
they will not notice

22:43.029 --> 22:46.866
the truly shoddy entertainment
I've hired tonight.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.435
You like
bachelorette parties?

22:48.468 --> 22:50.269
Sure.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.642
Blue Hawaiian.

22:55.675 --> 22:59.145
Brings out
your lovely blue eyes.

22:59.178 --> 23:01.147
Nice, that one actually made it
into the glass.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.615
Aren't you the sweetest?

23:02.649 --> 23:03.716
Oh!

23:03.750 --> 23:05.117
Why, thank you.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.153
I am gonna crush you!

23:07.186 --> 23:08.588
Hey, I am gonna
destroy you!

23:08.621 --> 23:10.957
When I'm done with you,
you won't be able

23:10.990 --> 23:12.525
to eat solids for a week!
You won't be able
to see straight!

23:12.559 --> 23:14.894
Hit me, I dare you!

23:14.927 --> 23:16.128
Come on, hit me!

23:16.162 --> 23:18.197
I dare you!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, g-gentlemen!

23:18.230 --> 23:21.033
Take a shot!
Gentlemen, stop it!

23:21.067 --> 23:23.570
Hey, now!
Now, uh... do we, uh...

23:23.603 --> 23:26.439
do we have to talk
about civility?

23:27.540 --> 23:29.476
Get out of my way, four-eyes.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.177
Come on, man, look.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.713
I just, uh... I don't want
to see you get hurt.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.448
Why?

23:35.482 --> 23:36.649
Don't you think
Little Zach Druker

23:36.683 --> 23:38.451
can take care of himself, huh?

23:38.485 --> 23:40.052
This guy?

23:40.086 --> 23:41.654
How about I show you? Yeah.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.756
Yeah, you, big-mouth four-eyes.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.091
Me.

23:45.124 --> 23:48.060
Showdown tomorrow
behind the Dixie Stop at noon.

23:49.228 --> 23:50.597
Tomorrow.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.200
(chuckles)

23:54.233 --> 23:55.968
Come on!

23:59.138 --> 24:00.172
Joel?

24:00.206 --> 24:02.542
Are you really gonna
fight Little Zach?

24:03.810 --> 24:06.178
Not a fight.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.648
A showdown-- at high noon.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.185
I'm a cowboy.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.461
(indistinct chatter)

24:27.734 --> 24:30.102
A.B., how's everything? Okay.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.971
All right, is now
a good time to talk

24:32.004 --> 24:34.173
about why you are throwing this
party for that horrible girl?

24:34.206 --> 24:36.108
Nope, I got to go get ready.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.711
We're gonna play a game called
"Pin the Junk on the Hunk."

24:38.745 --> 24:41.013
And then I'm gonna take
that pin and slit my wrists.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.149
Oh! Bye.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.020
(whistling)

24:50.156 --> 24:51.691
Hello there, sir.
Hey!

24:51.724 --> 24:53.092
See my bar's
still in one piece.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.293
How was your walk in my shoes?

24:54.326 --> 24:55.728
So amazing.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.129
Do you remember
those two guys from before?

24:57.163 --> 24:58.297
Little Zach and Big Tom?

24:58.330 --> 25:00.132
They got into
another scuffle.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.068
I tried to break it up.
Didn't work.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.637
So, me and the little one,
we are fighting

25:04.671 --> 25:06.005
tomorrow

25:06.038 --> 25:08.140
in an alleyway at noon.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.709
Wh-What?

25:09.742 --> 25:11.077
You're fighting Little Zach?

25:11.110 --> 25:12.612
Yeah.

25:12.645 --> 25:13.613
Bad.

25:13.646 --> 25:14.814
Ass.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.716
No, Little Zach is mean.
I once saw him

25:16.749 --> 25:18.117
beat up an old man
for taking

25:18.150 --> 25:19.552
the last scone
at the Butterstick.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.153
Fighting him is

25:21.187 --> 25:22.655
a terrible idea!

25:22.689 --> 25:24.256
Well, I threatened
to give them a speech

25:24.290 --> 25:26.693
on civility, like you did,
but that didn't work.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.161
Yeah, you know why? Becau...

25:29.195 --> 25:32.164
Because this is
my speech on civility.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.700
All right?
First time they fought,

25:33.733 --> 25:35.267
I had to ring
their bells with it.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.604
Well, that is information
that would've been good to know

25:37.637 --> 25:39.806
before you left me at the bar!

25:41.608 --> 25:42.875
(knocking)

25:42.909 --> 25:44.310
Yeah?

25:45.878 --> 25:48.781
Tom? Did I order a pizza?

25:48.815 --> 25:50.750
Oh, yeah, that's not for you.

25:50.783 --> 25:51.784
What did Lavon say?

25:51.818 --> 25:54.053
Oh, uh, man, he said no.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.122
Uh, I'm sorry, Tom.
I knew it was a long shot,

25:56.155 --> 25:57.323
but I did file some papers

25:57.356 --> 25:58.791
with the county, so...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:58.825 --> 26:01.227
He-he-he said no
and you just let him?

26:02.361 --> 26:05.665
No. I mean, Tom,
he seemed pretty firm about it.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.734
I am going to great lengths,

26:07.767 --> 26:09.602
long, long, Tom-Long lengths,

26:09.636 --> 26:12.204
to make this farm
happen for Wanda.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.206
The least you can do is fight
the good fight with Lavon.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.342
Okay.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.877
You know what?
You're right, you're right.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.311
I'm gonna go over there
right now.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.080
And I will not take no
for an answer.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.248
How's that?

26:22.281 --> 26:23.883
Good. Thank you.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.184
You're welcome.
Now, go deliver that pizza

26:25.217 --> 26:26.285
before it gets cold.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.788
(chuckling):
Oh, I do so envy

26:28.821 --> 26:30.690
your innocence, George Tucker.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.725
(women whooping)

26:35.762 --> 26:37.630
SADIE:
Come on, boys!

26:37.664 --> 26:39.131
Take it off!

26:39.966 --> 26:41.901
Just shake it!

26:41.934 --> 26:42.935
Ooh, ooh!

26:45.972 --> 26:47.373
In your, uh,
trained medical opinion,

26:47.406 --> 26:49.842
how much alcohol
do you need to consume

26:49.876 --> 26:52.278
to erase horrifying memories?

26:52.311 --> 26:54.747
Some scars never heal.

26:55.682 --> 26:56.949
(whooping)

27:11.931 --> 27:13.733
Are you having fun?

27:13.766 --> 27:17.269
So much fun!

27:17.303 --> 27:18.671
Hiring Tom and Meatball

27:18.705 --> 27:20.840
was a hilarious idea.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.374
You are such a hoot!

27:22.408 --> 27:24.276
The humor must help you
through the rough times.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.412
But don't worry, dear!

27:26.445 --> 27:28.748
I am sure that your time
for all this

27:28.781 --> 27:30.750
is fast approaching.

27:30.783 --> 27:31.818
Oh, you get back here!

27:31.851 --> 27:33.886
(women clamoring)

27:37.189 --> 27:38.725
(sighs)
Okay, so...

27:38.758 --> 27:40.192
what happens
if I tell Little Zach

27:40.226 --> 27:41.293
that I won't fight him?

27:41.327 --> 27:42.428
Well, this might surprise you,

27:42.461 --> 27:43.996
but Little Zach isn't
all that clever.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.932
He will probably
call you "chicken"

27:45.965 --> 27:48.234
or "four-eyes"
and then knock you out.

27:48.267 --> 27:49.301
What would you do?

27:49.335 --> 27:50.402
This isn't about me.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.838
Yes, true, but if some stranger

27:51.871 --> 27:53.706
in a bar challenged you
to a showdown,

27:53.740 --> 27:56.208
even if you knew that you were
gonna get your ass kicked...

27:56.242 --> 27:57.209
I'd fight him anyway.

27:57.243 --> 27:58.377
Okay, fine.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.980
Then that's-that's
what I have to do.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.349
Look, Joel, have you ever
even thrown a punch?

28:04.851 --> 28:05.852
No.

28:06.953 --> 28:09.688
But you're gonna teach me how.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.360
How do you...?

28:14.393 --> 28:15.795
(clears throat)

28:15.828 --> 28:17.830
(women whooping)

28:33.045 --> 28:34.847
Crickett?

28:34.881 --> 28:37.817
Have I told you how beautiful
that color is on you?

28:37.850 --> 28:38.818
Thank you.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.352
Do you know
what it reminds me of?

28:40.386 --> 28:41.754
A gold filling.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.255
Like the one
BlueBell's gonna need to get

28:43.289 --> 28:44.356
after eating
all your sugary cakes.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.525
I can't change it!

28:46.558 --> 28:48.494
I wish I could,
but I can't, okay?

28:48.527 --> 28:49.829
Why not?

28:49.862 --> 28:50.930
Because.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.899
Mind your own beeswax is why!

28:53.800 --> 28:54.934
Oh!

28:54.967 --> 28:57.303
(groans)

28:59.438 --> 29:00.973
(gasps)

29:01.007 --> 29:03.976
Too many tequila.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.377
I...

29:05.411 --> 29:08.380
n-need doctor.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.383
DON TODD:
Today we're setting up base camp
at the base of Mt. Kilimanjaro.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.952
(laughs)

29:12.985 --> 29:14.453
Where the atmosphere is so thin

29:14.486 --> 29:17.489
that the ball just explodes
off the club face.

29:17.523 --> 29:21.994
Not unlike a... a man's eyeball
who's this high above sea level.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.796
Okay! Everything's going black!
(door opens)

29:23.830 --> 29:25.497
It's going black!
(door closes)

29:25.531 --> 29:28.400
Why don't they give small town
mayors secret service?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.802
George, what do you want?

29:29.836 --> 29:31.503
Lavon, I am done
tiptoeing around you.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.840
Why did you deny Tom
and Wanda's application?

29:33.873 --> 29:35.541
Because I did.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.410
Alpacas are dangerous.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.512
Lavon, you have a pet alligator.

29:40.546 --> 29:44.283
Okay? What the hell's
going on here, man?

29:44.316 --> 29:46.352
Wanda asked me
to do her a favor.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.021
She doesn't want
the damn alpacas.

29:49.055 --> 29:52.424
She was afraid
to tell Tom.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.061
Well, that's good to know.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.897
And no need
to tiptoe around me.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.933
If I wanted to turn your face
inside out, I would've.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.468
You would've tried.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.506
Good point. Good point.

30:07.539 --> 30:08.574
See you around, Lavon.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.843
Yeah.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.511
I have not felt this bad

30:12.544 --> 30:14.914
since the Delta Sig Redneck Ball

30:14.947 --> 30:18.150
my sophomore year.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.920
Here.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.455
AnnaBeth, who cares
that Elodie found

30:23.489 --> 30:25.124
some other nitwit to marry?

30:25.157 --> 30:26.926
It's not a competition.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.595
You're right.
I know you're right.

30:29.628 --> 30:32.531
And we are taking steps.

30:32.564 --> 30:34.100
Last week, he got me

30:34.133 --> 30:35.167
my own toothbrush holder.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.070
See? Progress.

30:38.104 --> 30:41.407
And we've agreed
to taking it slow.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.842
And I'm fine with waiting.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.915
I told him I was fine
with waiting.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.883
So, you're not?

30:50.917 --> 30:52.919
I don't know. I just...

30:55.421 --> 30:58.624
He has all the power.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.893
And all I can do is sit around

31:00.927 --> 31:02.528
and wait for him
to change his mind.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.064
(retching nearby)

31:05.097 --> 31:08.600
(coughing)

31:08.634 --> 31:11.503
Right, but so what

31:11.537 --> 31:14.606
if you're alone forever?

31:14.640 --> 31:17.009
At least you didn't
bankrupt the Belles.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.545
Oh, Crickett, no.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.513
Cake Fest is a moneymaker.

31:21.547 --> 31:24.116
I need that money
to pay our charter dues,

31:24.150 --> 31:27.019
or it's hasta la vista, Belles.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.520
They will kill me.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.621
Well, at least
that explains things.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.390
(hiccups)

31:31.423 --> 31:33.392
Now, if you ladies
will excuse me,

31:33.425 --> 31:36.062
I have some
cakes to bake.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.141
(people talking, laughing)

31:49.175 --> 31:50.943
All right, it's the last
day of the challenge,

31:50.977 --> 31:51.810
the bike ride!

31:51.843 --> 31:54.513
Let's loosen up those
hammies, people!

31:54.546 --> 31:56.048
MEATBALL:
Oh, man.

31:56.082 --> 31:57.449
I forgot what
deliciousness looked like.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.021
So you're really going
through with this?

32:02.054 --> 32:03.089
Cellulite wins again.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.691
How could you
bankrupt the Belles?

32:05.724 --> 32:07.559
Shh!

32:07.593 --> 32:10.262
I spent our cash reserves
buying the Belles' love.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.263
Spa days,

32:11.297 --> 32:13.699
makeovers,
designer handbags.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.267
A lottery for
a Hawaiian vacation.

32:15.301 --> 32:16.702
Oh, Crickett.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.038
Oh, I'm really sorry
about your health month.

32:20.072 --> 32:20.973
ZOE:
Well...

32:21.007 --> 32:23.275
we'll just pre-burn
those cake calories.

32:23.309 --> 32:26.078
All right, guys,
we're gonna finish strong!

32:26.112 --> 32:27.646
50 miles
instead of 20!

32:27.679 --> 32:29.481
Let's do
this thing!

32:29.515 --> 32:30.649
Oh... Sorry, doc.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.451
Those Hummingbird cakes
look too good.

32:32.484 --> 32:35.121
Sayonara,
health food!

32:39.625 --> 32:41.093
Come on!

32:41.127 --> 32:42.561
WADE:
All right, here we go,
buddy, come on.

32:42.594 --> 32:43.762
All right, all right,
here we go.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.597
Whoa, whoa...
whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.066
Whatever you do,
don't tuck your thumbs

32:47.099 --> 32:48.134
into your fists,
all right?

32:48.167 --> 32:49.468
You'll break them,
not him.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.237
Little Zach's gonna
kill me, isn't he?

32:51.270 --> 32:52.238
Yeah.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.206
(sighs)
Look, Joel,

32:54.240 --> 32:56.508
maybe it's time
to face facts, all right?

32:56.542 --> 32:58.310
You're not a badass
or a cowboy,

32:58.344 --> 32:59.678
and you shouldn't
try to be.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.614
But you, Joel Stephens,
as you are...

33:02.648 --> 33:03.715
should be happy.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.751
Right? You're-you're
a smart dude,

33:05.784 --> 33:08.220
you got a great girl.

33:08.254 --> 33:09.188
Great career.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.190
I- I should probably be
following you around.

33:12.058 --> 33:13.525
Well, I'm kidding, but...

33:13.559 --> 33:14.760
But what about
Little Zach, though?

33:14.793 --> 33:16.028
He's gonna be
looking for me.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.496
Don't worry about it,
all right?

33:17.529 --> 33:18.530
I'll take care of him.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.232
(sighing):
Oh, good.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.034
'Cause I-I probably
do need my hands...

33:22.068 --> 33:23.169
for typing.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.704
Right. Okay.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.042
I don't get it!

33:30.076 --> 33:31.310
So why don't we
get our permit?

33:31.343 --> 33:33.279
It-It's complicated, Tom.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.613
You are a bad,
mean mayor!

33:34.646 --> 33:35.781
(Wanda gasps)
GEORGE:
Okay. Hold on.

33:35.814 --> 33:39.185
Wanda...
is there anything

33:39.218 --> 33:41.687
you'd like
to say here?

33:43.589 --> 33:45.291
Okay, fine!

33:45.324 --> 33:48.260
Tom, I don't want alpacas.

33:48.294 --> 33:51.697
Their eyes are too big
and they scare me.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.699
They don't even
have teeth!

33:53.732 --> 33:56.335
But I knew how much
you wanted them.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.238
So I asked Lavon

33:59.271 --> 34:01.173
not to give us the permit.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.574
(stammering)

34:02.608 --> 34:04.143
They are not scary, Wanda.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.144
They're cute.

34:05.177 --> 34:06.378
I mean, think
of the wool!

34:06.412 --> 34:07.846
Think of
the sweaters!

34:07.879 --> 34:09.348
Think of the Kleenex box cozies!

34:09.380 --> 34:11.783
No...
I...

34:11.817 --> 34:12.818
I'll do everything.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.152
I'll feed them,

34:14.186 --> 34:15.286
and I'll walk
them, and I...

34:15.321 --> 34:16.288
No.
I-I'll love them.

34:16.322 --> 34:18.090
No way.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.126
(chuckles)

34:20.159 --> 34:22.161
Think our work's
done, yes?

34:22.194 --> 34:23.329
Yeah.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.331
Yeah, think so,
and, uh...

34:25.364 --> 34:27.299
and us?

34:27.333 --> 34:29.301
Okay, look:

34:29.335 --> 34:30.569
I am sorry about Lynly.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.103
I really did like her,

34:32.138 --> 34:34.172
but I should've been honest
with you from the start.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.308
And... yeah,

34:36.342 --> 34:38.143
I probably could have
ended things with her...

34:38.177 --> 34:39.378
a little earlier.

34:39.411 --> 34:42.181
Yeah, well...

34:42.214 --> 34:44.815
she probably would've burned
Tansy's hair off anyway,

34:44.850 --> 34:47.219
so, uh,
lesson learned?

34:47.253 --> 34:48.420
Lessons learned.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.755
(laughing):
Indeed.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.123
Indubitably.

34:51.157 --> 34:52.391
(laughing)

34:52.424 --> 34:54.360
BRICK:
Oh, Dr. Hart.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.228
Is that frosting
on your cheek,

34:56.262 --> 34:58.230
or-or your tears making
your mascara run?

34:58.264 --> 34:59.231
Fine.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.632
I surrender.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.201
From the way this
town has taken

35:02.234 --> 35:03.602
to shoving cake
in their faces,

35:03.635 --> 35:04.803
you have obviously
won the bet.

35:04.836 --> 35:07.606
I remain your
humble servant,

35:07.639 --> 35:09.208
my house stays
in shambles,

35:09.241 --> 35:10.776
and the Belles live
to see another day.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.711
So you'll, uh, be
on call this weekend.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.446
I'm gonna go visit
Lemon and my mother.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.681
Poor things.
Yeah.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.149
You got it, boss.

35:17.183 --> 35:21.387
Or maybe I'll take
a long weekend in Bermuda.

35:23.289 --> 35:24.823
(sighs)

35:35.301 --> 35:36.835
AnnaBeth?

35:36.868 --> 35:38.670
Sweetheart?

35:38.704 --> 35:39.871
Oh...

35:39.905 --> 35:42.374
(moans)

35:42.408 --> 35:43.242
(chuckles)

35:43.275 --> 35:44.876
I heard you had yourself
quite a night.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.346
Yeah, tequila is
Satan's drink of choice.

35:47.379 --> 35:48.347
Yeah.

35:48.380 --> 35:51.183
Well, don't worry.

35:51.217 --> 35:53.485
You'll feel better after
you eat something greasy.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.325
Actually, I don't think I will.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.429
Lavon, can we talk?

36:13.972 --> 36:16.308
Well, howdy
there, cowboy.

36:16.342 --> 36:17.676
I thought you would be,

36:17.709 --> 36:18.810
I don't know,
at the rodeo

36:18.844 --> 36:19.945
or remodeling
some stables.

36:19.978 --> 36:21.847
Fine, okay.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.949
I realize I, uh,
went a little crazy.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.384
Of course we can
hire a contractor.

36:25.417 --> 36:26.718
I'll pay whatever
we need to.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.920
Well, you'll have to,
because I lost the bet.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.256
(laughs)

36:30.289 --> 36:32.258
Well, I'm sorry
that I even suggested

36:32.291 --> 36:33.959
that I, uh, do it myself.

36:33.992 --> 36:35.694
Um...

36:35.727 --> 36:36.595
Tom is right.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.964
I should probably
scrap my whole book

36:38.997 --> 36:40.399
and just start from scratch.

36:40.432 --> 36:43.001
Leave the cowboy writing
to the real cowboys.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.971
Joel Stephens,
no, you are wrong.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.373
Your way with words,

36:47.406 --> 36:48.840
your brain,

36:48.874 --> 36:50.309
your courage
to face every day

36:50.342 --> 36:51.910
knowing you could go
into anaphylactic shock

36:51.943 --> 36:53.512
from mold or-or pollen

36:53.545 --> 36:57.516
or peanuts... that is
pretty badass, my friend.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.951
I know that you can
write a great book.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.253
I believe in you.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.488
Thank you.

37:03.989 --> 37:06.458
You know what?

37:06.492 --> 37:07.959
I gotta do something.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.761
Wait!
What-what kind of something?

37:09.795 --> 37:11.463
(shouting)
Thanks for being
on time, guys!

37:11.497 --> 37:13.999
Let's make this quick so we can
get some pizza after this!

37:14.032 --> 37:15.000
Yeah!

37:15.033 --> 37:16.268
(chanting):
Fight! Fight!

37:16.302 --> 37:17.869
Let's do this!
Yeah!

37:17.903 --> 37:19.471
All right, now,
let's show him who's boss.

37:19.505 --> 37:20.572
You ready
to do this?

37:20.606 --> 37:22.441
Hey, Wade.

37:22.474 --> 37:23.775
I got no beef with you.

37:23.809 --> 37:24.776
I'm waiting for your friend.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.011
Yeah, well,
he's not coming.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.514
Wh... your pal
dissed Little Zach.

37:28.547 --> 37:29.515
He has to pay.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.016
With all due respect, sir.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.584
Look, it's over,
man, all right?

37:32.618 --> 37:35.020
Let me buy
you a drink.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.488
Well, a bunch of drinks,
all right?

37:36.522 --> 37:38.890
Come on.
I like the beard, man.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.926
You look great.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.530
Well, hello...

37:44.563 --> 37:45.564
four-eyes.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.998
(laughing):
Four-eyes!

37:47.032 --> 37:48.434
It's amazing,
as if on cue!

37:48.467 --> 37:49.968
All right,
it's all right.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.903
Well, how you
doing there...

37:51.937 --> 37:52.938
shrimpy?

37:54.540 --> 37:55.407
Wade, did you see that?

37:55.441 --> 37:57.576
I hit that guy, just
like you taught me!

37:57.609 --> 37:59.077
I see what you meant
by thumbs out, though;

37:59.110 --> 38:01.380
that really...
(yelling)

38:01.413 --> 38:02.914
My God!

38:02.948 --> 38:04.950
I'm gonna kill you,
four-eyes!

38:04.983 --> 38:06.051
(yelling)

38:06.084 --> 38:08.454
Next time, we're gonna
work on defense, all right?

38:08.487 --> 38:10.389
(yelling)
He's so angry!

38:10.422 --> 38:11.590
He's so angry!

38:11.623 --> 38:12.591
Okay.

38:12.624 --> 38:16.528
* Long ago when I was young

38:16.562 --> 38:20.332
* Faith alone
could make no more *

38:20.366 --> 38:23.802
* Oh, my God

38:23.835 --> 38:29.575
* Oh, my God...

38:30.609 --> 38:32.511
Thanks for helping out.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.380
Oh, I know all about
making mistakes,

38:34.413 --> 38:35.381
believe me.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.314
There you go.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.016
One cookies and cream
for Sheriff Bill.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.085
I promise to run
twice as far tomorrow.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.953
Oh, well, don't
worry about it.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.923
Health and Wellness Month
is pretty much over.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.392
But a health and
wellness lifestyle

38:46.425 --> 38:47.959
can last a healthy
lifetime.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.127
Totally.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.830
* Be my soul

38:51.863 --> 38:53.565
* That never could see

38:53.599 --> 38:55.100
* You said in your heart

38:55.133 --> 38:59.471
* Be still your goals

38:59.505 --> 39:01.440
* That never could breach

39:01.473 --> 39:04.476
* The walls of your...

39:04.510 --> 39:06.512
*

39:08.614 --> 39:10.449
George.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.617
You look nice today.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.051
Can I get you
a table? Coffee?

39:13.084 --> 39:14.686
I'm not here for coffee.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.887
Well, then, what?

39:23.061 --> 39:24.630
We should go out sometime.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.366
Okay.

39:36.141 --> 39:38.577
I-I guess I still
don't understand.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.012
We are making
progress.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.148
I-I got you the new
toothbrush holder.

39:44.516 --> 39:47.519
And I appreciate it, I do.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.120
I get that you've
been burned before.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.689
That you want
to take it slow.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.426
But I'm 31
years old.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.995
And we've been
together a year.

39:58.664 --> 40:01.633
And I knew...

40:01.667 --> 40:03.669
in just one month,

40:03.702 --> 40:05.637
with absolute
certainty,

40:05.671 --> 40:08.406
that you are
the love of my life.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.043
Well, good.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.580
So what's the problem?

40:14.613 --> 40:16.047
(laughs)

40:16.081 --> 40:18.049
Well, there doesn't
have to be a problem.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.186
I mean, I'll wait
to get married

40:21.219 --> 40:24.155
ten years, 100,
forever...

40:26.758 --> 40:28.426
...if you can tell
me one thing.

40:30.696 --> 40:36.067
After nearly
365 days together,

40:36.101 --> 40:39.971
do you know for sure

40:40.005 --> 40:43.575
ifam the love
of you life?

40:52.718 --> 40:54.219
I love you.

40:57.656 --> 40:59.725
So much.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.732
Well, I guess...

41:06.765 --> 41:10.669
there's nothing else
to say, then, is there?

41:13.138 --> 41:16.708
* No way out

41:16.742 --> 41:18.977
* I can see the morning coming

41:19.010 --> 41:20.679
(audience cheering)

41:20.712 --> 41:22.147
(Zoe gasps)

41:22.180 --> 41:23.749
Oh, my God,
what happened?

41:23.782 --> 41:26.084
Well, your cowboy got
in his first gunfight.

41:26.117 --> 41:28.119
Lucky for him, he's got
a doctor in his corner.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.487
Thanks.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.692
Honey, we need to get you
some ice for that.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.561
And then we need
to talk about

41:35.594 --> 41:36.528
where we're gonna live,
'cause Duke said

41:36.562 --> 41:38.530
that the remodel is
going to take two months.

41:38.564 --> 41:39.998
And I'm not going back
to the Whippoorwill.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.267
Zoe, I just got
my ass kicked.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.069
I got clocked in the face.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.737
It's kind of sexy, right?

41:45.771 --> 41:46.738
Come here.

41:46.772 --> 41:49.274
(laughing)

41:49.307 --> 41:52.510
(cheering)
