WEBVTT

00:56.924 --> 00:59.364
- We're gonna be late.

01:15.679 --> 01:16.579
- Going.

01:19.947 --> 01:20.847
Going.

01:23.918 --> 01:24.818
Gone.

01:44.411 --> 01:45.839
We'll be right back.

01:45.874 --> 01:47.775
- God forbid college boy
gets his hands dirty.

01:47.810 --> 01:50.184
- He probably has
homework to do.

01:50.219 --> 01:52.318
- See anything, you
know the score.

02:27.718 --> 02:28.684
- Guard dog, guard dog!

02:30.919 --> 02:33.524
Get it off, get it off!

02:33.559 --> 02:35.262
- Hello! Hello, gorgeous.

02:35.297 --> 02:36.230
- Ugh, I hate dogs!

02:36.265 --> 02:37.297
- What you doing?

02:37.332 --> 02:38.958
- Let's just get it done.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.409
- Who buys junk like this?

02:50.444 --> 02:53.346
- Rich pricks. More
money than sense.

02:59.816 --> 03:00.716
What you doing?

03:02.357 --> 03:03.884
We're here for the
painting, nothing else.

03:03.919 --> 03:05.325
Go see where Leon is.

03:21.904 --> 03:23.508
- That's worth 25k?

03:24.445 --> 03:26.005
- That's what we'll get.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.875
Worth 10 times for
the right buyer.

03:30.352 --> 03:31.252
Bag it up.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.040
- Oh, shit!

04:07.884 --> 04:09.048
- Yeah?

04:09.083 --> 04:11.424
- They're back.
The fam is back.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.426
- Gig's up, go, go, go!

04:15.463 --> 04:16.088
- Shit!

04:22.437 --> 04:23.469
- I knew we'd be late.

04:23.504 --> 04:24.800
- It's upstairs, I think!

04:31.875 --> 04:35.811
- That woman would forget her
head if it wasn't screwed on.

04:35.846 --> 04:38.913
Good girl, come on,
in the kitchen.

04:38.948 --> 04:39.848
Come on.

04:45.757 --> 04:48.725
- Actually, it's in the
sitting room!

05:04.512 --> 05:06.105
- That shit was close.

05:08.010 --> 05:09.614
It's self-defense.

05:09.649 --> 05:10.714
- Not when you're in
their house, it's not.

05:10.749 --> 05:11.913
- Way I see it, it's a choice

05:11.948 --> 05:12.947
between knocking some
chump on the head

05:12.982 --> 05:13.882
or doing a stretch.

05:13.917 --> 05:14.817
Ain't no choice at all.

05:14.852 --> 05:15.983
- My gig, my rules.

05:16.018 --> 05:18.458
If you don't like them,
you can walk.

05:19.758 --> 05:22.363
- Someone get
this thing off me!

05:31.671 --> 05:32.505
- We good?

05:32.540 --> 05:33.638
- Now I'm good.

05:33.673 --> 05:34.804
Get us of here, bro.

07:17.612 --> 07:21.108
- French, 19th century.

07:21.143 --> 07:23.880
The lizard represents
new beginnings,

07:23.915 --> 07:25.816
a shedding of old habits.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.686
A symbol...

07:34.761 --> 07:37.531
A symbol of a true survivor.

07:37.566 --> 07:39.665
It teaches us that
we can be transformed

07:39.700 --> 07:41.700
and transcend our wounds.

07:43.737 --> 07:44.670
- You'll have them shipped

07:44.705 --> 07:45.803
to the usual address?

07:45.838 --> 07:46.738
- Of course.

07:47.774 --> 07:49.609
A pleasure doing
business with you.

08:04.186 --> 08:05.658
- What's her problem?

08:07.288 --> 08:08.661
- Aristocracy.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.257
They fear what they
don't understand.

08:12.832 --> 08:14.095
Is that for me, Charlie?

08:14.130 --> 08:15.261
- It's Chaz.

08:20.741 --> 08:22.136
- Ottoman Warriors.

08:23.172 --> 08:24.974
Mid 18th century.

08:25.977 --> 08:27.548
Outstanding!

08:33.314 --> 08:35.754
I do have more work
I could put your way.

08:35.789 --> 08:37.052
- Not interested.

08:37.087 --> 08:38.284
- Are you sure?

08:38.319 --> 08:39.923
- What's the gig?

08:39.958 --> 08:41.694
- This is easy money.

08:44.028 --> 08:44.928
- We're done.

08:46.965 --> 08:48.129
- See you later, old man.

09:00.143 --> 09:02.275
- Yeah! What was that?

09:06.380 --> 09:07.885
- Shut up.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.019
- That is a total fluke,
man. Are you joking?

09:11.693 --> 09:12.593
Nice one, man.

09:14.696 --> 09:15.893
- Yes, my friend.

09:17.732 --> 09:18.632
- The old man say anything

09:18.667 --> 09:19.732
about the next gig?

09:19.767 --> 09:22.163
- Yeah, I turned it down.

09:23.166 --> 09:24.066
- What?

09:24.970 --> 09:26.101
- Look, this was only ever

09:26.136 --> 09:27.674
about putting my
brother through uni.

09:27.709 --> 09:29.203
You two knew that.

09:29.238 --> 09:31.370
This money's gonna get
him through uni debt free.

09:32.340 --> 09:33.372
Get him off the manor for good.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.879
- Yeah, and what about us?

09:34.914 --> 09:37.750
- You ain't my responsibility,
Vix.

09:39.754 --> 09:42.722
- I can't believe you're
shutting us down, man.

09:42.757 --> 09:45.021
We got a good thing going
here, something we're good at.

09:45.056 --> 09:46.154
- You could get a job.

09:47.861 --> 09:49.256
- What, go legit?

09:49.291 --> 09:50.961
Doing what? Fucking
zero-hour contracts?

09:50.996 --> 09:53.029
I'd rather be a thief
than work for one.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.099
So that's that?

09:57.134 --> 09:58.936
After all, we've been through?

09:58.971 --> 10:00.135
I thought we were blood.

10:03.910 --> 10:05.338
- What, you agree with her?

10:05.373 --> 10:06.812
- He said it would
be easy money.

10:06.847 --> 10:09.012
- Yeah, easy by him.
We take all the risk.

10:09.982 --> 10:12.015
Look, you're supposed to
be the smart one.

10:13.051 --> 10:14.688
You're better than this.

10:14.723 --> 10:15.788
Better than us.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.823
- I'm not better than anyone.

10:17.858 --> 10:18.989
- So what you saying?

10:25.096 --> 10:26.865
- I'm saying we do the gig.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.736
We get the money and we
move off the manor together.

10:45.787 --> 10:48.216
- Come on, man, let's do this.

11:07.072 --> 11:08.973
- All right, knobhead?

11:51.413 --> 11:54.821
- So what is a
ceremonial hunting knife?

11:54.856 --> 11:56.889
- What do you think it is?

11:56.924 --> 11:59.892
It's a knife used in a ceremony.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.256
- Okay, then what's a ceremony.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.994
- How long you lived in
this country?

12:03.029 --> 12:04.930
You still don't know what
shit means.

12:04.965 --> 12:07.933
- It's a special occasion,
like a wedding.

12:07.968 --> 12:09.429
- Then why I call it a
wedding knife?

12:09.464 --> 12:12.036
- Does that look like
it's used to cut a cake.

12:12.071 --> 12:14.236
It's an antique, you div.

12:14.271 --> 12:15.941
- It's a wedge in your pocket,
Tod.

12:15.976 --> 12:19.175
That's all you got to
worry about.

12:46.369 --> 12:48.072
Big man, you're up.

13:25.914 --> 13:27.947
- Whoa, this is massive!

13:32.547 --> 13:33.447
No way!

13:44.493 --> 13:46.229
- Are you sure
there's no one home?

13:46.264 --> 13:48.198
- My guy says
the family's away.

13:48.233 --> 13:49.364
Off skiing, apparently.

13:50.301 --> 13:51.597
- Sounds about right.

13:59.277 --> 14:02.113
- Wow, I wonder
who lives here.

14:02.148 --> 14:03.147
Prince Andrew?

14:04.216 --> 14:05.314
- Probs his cousin.

14:05.349 --> 14:06.414
You know these lot
are all related.

14:10.189 --> 14:12.618
- It's gonna take all
night to search this gaff.

14:12.653 --> 14:14.356
We could use an extra
set of eyes.

14:14.391 --> 14:15.995
- Yes, she's right.

14:19.528 --> 14:20.428
- We'll manage.

14:26.106 --> 14:29.074
- Come on, bro! I'm
done waiting in the van!

14:29.109 --> 14:30.009
Let me help.

14:36.446 --> 14:37.346
- You stay by my side.

14:37.381 --> 14:38.710
- Yes!

14:38.745 --> 14:40.217
- Hey, it's about time
you popped your cherry.

15:13.186 --> 15:15.714
Who are you expecting? Dracula?

15:15.749 --> 15:18.123
- Relax, we're miles
away from any village.

15:18.158 --> 15:19.091
No one can hear us.

15:36.506 --> 15:37.406
- Whoa.

15:40.279 --> 15:42.378
- Right, me and Chaz will
take the second floor.

15:42.413 --> 15:45.150
You two start down here and
we'll meet in the middle.

15:51.455 --> 15:53.422
- What the fuck?

16:10.078 --> 16:11.044
- Keep moving, bro.

16:36.368 --> 16:37.268
- Keep looking.

16:48.776 --> 16:49.808
- Imagine
bumping into that

16:49.843 --> 16:51.678
in the middle of the night.

16:51.713 --> 16:53.119
- Can't be worse
than some of the girls

16:53.154 --> 16:53.812
you brought home.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.715
- Yeah.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.556
- What is it with
rich white folks

17:01.591 --> 17:03.459
and having dead
animals on the wall?

17:15.308 --> 17:16.736
You want me to get Tod?

17:18.245 --> 17:20.542
- Nah, we'll check
the rest first.

17:29.421 --> 17:31.454
- This lot ever
heard of a Kindle?

17:32.325 --> 17:33.654
- Like you ever read!

17:33.689 --> 17:35.359
- Hey, I have an iPad.

17:35.394 --> 17:36.591
- Yeah, scrolling
through Pornhub

17:36.626 --> 17:38.362
don't count as reading,
you know.

17:40.498 --> 17:41.761
- Look, I can read, you know?

17:43.204 --> 17:45.402
It just needs to be
something I'm interested in.

17:46.339 --> 17:47.305
- What? Like this?

17:48.242 --> 17:49.604
I heard it's got everything.

17:49.639 --> 17:50.671
- Vix.

17:50.706 --> 17:52.442
- Love, hate.
- Vix!

17:52.477 --> 17:54.675
- Sacrifice, betrayal.
- Vix!

17:55.645 --> 17:57.381
Don't mess with that,
it ain't right.

17:57.416 --> 17:58.547
- You're the one who
ain't right, mate.

17:58.582 --> 18:00.615
It's only a book.

18:00.650 --> 18:02.221
I'm gonna check upstairs.

18:57.773 --> 18:58.673
Tod?

19:22.666 --> 19:23.764
- Screw that.

19:36.680 --> 19:37.580
Leon?

19:40.519 --> 19:41.419
Bro.

19:44.655 --> 19:46.589
Yo, what's good?

19:53.565 --> 19:57.600
Bro.

19:57.635 --> 20:02.704
We're not alone.

20:02.739 --> 20:03.903
- Bingo.

20:10.747 --> 20:11.911
What's up?

20:11.946 --> 20:12.780
- Get downstairs,
we're bailing.

20:12.815 --> 20:14.452
- What? Why?

20:14.487 --> 20:15.519
- Just do it.

20:17.787 --> 20:18.687
- Man needs to chill.

20:18.722 --> 20:20.326
- Vix!

20:20.361 --> 20:21.019
Vix!

20:21.890 --> 20:22.856
- Shine torch.

20:24.992 --> 20:26.464
- Come on, let's go.

20:29.700 --> 20:32.437
- That's what I'm talking about.

20:33.473 --> 20:34.769
- Hello.

20:34.804 --> 20:35.770
Suits you.

20:48.785 --> 20:50.686
- Oh, what's going on?

21:06.572 --> 21:09.870
- Looks like you
picked the wrong house.

21:14.074 --> 21:17.977
♪ Go to sleep now little baby ♪

22:31.525 --> 22:33.888
- Let's get on with this,
shall we?

22:33.923 --> 22:36.990
I understand you're all
a bit disorientated.

22:38.466 --> 22:42.127
But bear with us and
everything will become clear.

23:14.634 --> 23:17.998
Last night you made
the unfortunate mistake

23:18.033 --> 23:20.506
of breaking into my
ancestral home.

23:21.575 --> 23:24.675
Now, I could have called the
police and had you arrested,

23:24.710 --> 23:26.875
but as I'm sure you are aware,

23:26.910 --> 23:31.583
our criminal justice system
is at best ineffective

23:31.618 --> 23:34.949
and at its worst a total
embarrassment.

23:35.820 --> 23:39.184
I've always said that
when a job needs doing,

23:39.219 --> 23:41.824
one must do it oneself.

23:55.202 --> 23:58.005
You see, there is a
natural order.

23:58.040 --> 24:01.910
An order which has guided the
people of this small island

24:01.945 --> 24:04.682
to the very peak of
civilization.

24:05.916 --> 24:09.687
There were rulers and
there were the ruled.

24:11.218 --> 24:16.188
But then you people, the
working classes...

24:16.223 --> 24:20.027
There used to be a
nobility in your struggle.

24:20.062 --> 24:23.800
Now all you do is beg
for handouts.

24:24.737 --> 24:26.869
And when you don't
get what you want...

24:28.708 --> 24:30.675
you feel you have
the right to take it.

24:31.843 --> 24:33.139
No, don't worry.

24:33.174 --> 24:35.141
This is not an execution.

24:36.881 --> 24:38.177
Where's the sport in that?

24:42.623 --> 24:44.084
- Careful, ma'am.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.156
- Oh, come on now.

24:50.191 --> 24:52.224
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

24:55.768 --> 24:57.801
Well, I think that's it.

24:58.870 --> 25:00.837
Good luck and Godspeed.

25:38.778 --> 25:40.272
- You said the gaff was empty,
man!

25:40.307 --> 25:41.944
- I was given bad intel!

25:41.979 --> 25:44.815
- We walked right
into that shit!

25:50.053 --> 25:51.382
How did they get you?

25:51.417 --> 25:53.725
- They tasered me in the dark.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.859
- I never saw 'em coming.

25:58.864 --> 25:59.962
- They took my phone!

26:02.230 --> 26:04.065
- Oh, shit, mine, too,
and my wallet!

26:04.100 --> 26:05.935
- So they know who we are.
Perfect.

26:09.743 --> 26:10.742
- Piss!

26:10.777 --> 26:12.073
They sprayed us with piss!

26:13.142 --> 26:15.175
- What the? That's rank!

26:20.017 --> 26:22.413
- This doesn't make any sense,
bro.

26:22.448 --> 26:23.821
Why did they let us go?

26:24.923 --> 26:26.252
Why did they wish us luck?

27:01.828 --> 27:03.795
- Oh, this is messed up, man.

27:03.830 --> 27:06.094
I really ain't about
this Bear Grylls shit.

27:06.129 --> 27:08.195
- Huh, I love Bear Grylls.

27:09.165 --> 27:12.100
- Look, all we need to do
is find a road and head out.

27:12.135 --> 27:13.904
- Yeah, I don't see no roads,
Chaz.

27:14.874 --> 27:16.775
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

27:16.810 --> 27:18.271
We could build a compass!

27:18.306 --> 27:19.811
- We'd be better off
letting you pray for help.

27:19.846 --> 27:21.373
- No, no, look, look.

27:21.408 --> 27:23.045
You take needle, okay?

27:23.080 --> 27:25.047
You rub it on forehead.

27:25.082 --> 27:26.345
You then place it on a leaf,

27:26.380 --> 27:29.084
and it tells you which
way is north.

27:29.119 --> 27:30.018
- And then what?

27:31.154 --> 27:33.418
- Well, then you know
which way north is.

27:33.453 --> 27:35.189
- And which direction is London?

27:36.423 --> 27:38.258
- I don't know.
- Then think!

27:38.293 --> 27:39.996
What good is it having a
compass if you don't know

27:40.031 --> 27:41.393
which direction you're
going in the first place?

27:41.428 --> 27:42.999
- Let's keep moving, guys.

27:45.905 --> 27:47.300
- They'll be having
us drinking our own piss

27:47.335 --> 27:49.038
in a minute.

27:49.073 --> 27:50.204
- There's no way
I'm drinking my own piss.

27:50.239 --> 27:51.909
- I'll make you.
Fucking nettle!

27:51.944 --> 27:52.778
- Let's roll.

28:45.294 --> 28:46.964
- That might be a river.

29:03.884 --> 29:04.784
- What?

29:05.512 --> 29:07.281
- Did you hear that?

29:11.485 --> 29:13.254
I was pretty sure I
heard something.

29:14.389 --> 29:15.487
- Wait, I can hear it.

29:19.295 --> 29:20.800
- Sounds like a car, right?

29:24.300 --> 29:25.035
- Yeah, we might be closer
to a road than we thought.

29:25.972 --> 29:27.598
- Wait, I hear bass.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.270
- It's not bass.

29:35.949 --> 29:36.849
- What's that?

29:42.582 --> 29:44.989
- It's a fox hunt.

29:45.024 --> 29:46.089
- Hey! hey!

29:46.124 --> 29:47.959
- What're you doing? Shut up!

29:47.994 --> 29:49.994
- They might know a
way out of here!

29:50.029 --> 29:52.524
- Wait, I thought fox
hunting was banned.

29:52.559 --> 29:54.031
- It is.

29:55.232 --> 29:56.429
- So what they hunting?

30:00.006 --> 30:02.369
- Run!

30:13.921 --> 30:14.887
- Hurry up!

30:21.654 --> 30:22.620
- Oh, shit!

30:41.014 --> 30:42.475
- Guys, I can't swim!

30:42.510 --> 30:43.674
- You have no choice!

30:46.547 --> 30:47.986
I've got him! Just go!

30:48.021 --> 30:48.921
Go!

30:49.616 --> 30:50.989
- I can't.

30:51.024 --> 30:51.583
- Look, it's the river
or the dogs, Tod!

30:51.618 --> 30:52.419
You decide!

30:53.554 --> 30:55.422
- Let's go! Hurry up!

31:10.373 --> 31:12.945
- Come on, give me your hand.

31:19.019 --> 31:21.349
- Lovely day for it.

31:21.384 --> 31:24.055
Oh, don't tell me
you're tired already.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.056
- Fuck you!

31:27.423 --> 31:29.522
- This is what we like to see.

31:29.557 --> 31:31.524
- Boys, get the fuck
out of here.

31:31.559 --> 31:34.527
- That's right. You run along.

31:34.562 --> 31:35.660
We'll catch up soon.

31:36.762 --> 31:37.629
- Let's go!

31:39.765 --> 31:42.106
- You're not
wrong about the quarry, mm.

31:42.141 --> 31:43.569
- I told you they'd
be good sport.

31:43.604 --> 31:46.077
- Their kind were born running.

31:46.112 --> 31:47.540
- What do you think, Aunt Kat?

31:48.378 --> 31:50.378
I'm told red is my colour.

31:50.413 --> 31:52.182
- We'll find out soon enough.

31:54.219 --> 31:55.416
The hounds?

31:55.451 --> 31:58.485
- They're all good, ma'am.
Good to go.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.454
We'll cross the river
about half a mile up

32:00.489 --> 32:02.687
and pick the scent up again.

32:02.722 --> 32:05.096
- I don't see the logic in
giving them a head start.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.098
- Patience, boy. That's
the thrill of the chase.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.167
- And trust me, they
won't get far.

32:30.684 --> 32:33.553
- What the fuck is going on?

32:33.588 --> 32:37.128
I mean, can you
believe this shit?

32:37.163 --> 32:38.459
- You all right?

32:39.726 --> 32:44.762
Do you see anyone?

32:48.801 --> 32:50.570
- Don't give me that rules shit.

32:50.605 --> 32:53.045
- Fuck the rules. Tool up.

32:57.678 --> 32:58.776
- They ain't gonna stop.

32:58.811 --> 33:00.250
- Then we don't stop.

33:29.644 --> 33:33.283
- All right, let's head
towards the trees.

33:44.659 --> 33:46.362
- That ceremonial knife,

33:46.397 --> 33:48.760
we weren't supposed
to find it were we?

33:48.795 --> 33:50.300
- They knew we were coming.

33:51.831 --> 33:53.369
- So the old man set us up.

33:58.706 --> 33:59.738
I'm sorry, bro.

34:01.478 --> 34:02.576
This wouldn't have
happened if it wasn't-

34:02.611 --> 34:04.677
- Hey, don't even go there.

34:04.712 --> 34:07.548
The old man's going to get
what's coming to him, trust.

34:10.388 --> 34:11.783
At least we're off the manor.

34:13.490 --> 34:14.753
- I was thinking more
Notting Hill.

34:17.791 --> 34:20.495
- Ah, you motherfucking
piece of shit!

34:20.530 --> 34:22.365
- Whoa!

34:22.400 --> 34:24.730
I think that's the first time
I've ever heard you swear.

34:27.801 --> 34:29.603
- Whoa, whoa wait!
My crucifix is gone!

34:29.638 --> 34:30.703
- Let's keep going, guys.

34:30.738 --> 34:32.441
- It ain't like He's helping us.

34:32.476 --> 34:34.476
In case you hadn't realised,
we're being hunted.

34:39.285 --> 34:39.910
- What the?

34:46.523 --> 34:47.423
What the fuck is this?

34:50.725 --> 34:52.131
- That's a bear trap.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.400
Bro!

35:00.735 --> 35:01.800
- Nobody move.

35:04.310 --> 35:05.936
- What the fuck is wrong
with these people, man?

35:05.971 --> 35:09.742
- All right, eyes on the
ground floor, follow my steps.

35:23.527 --> 35:24.460
- Fuck this!

35:24.495 --> 35:27.397
- Tod, Tod, Tod, Tod!

35:56.725 --> 35:58.857
- I told you they
wouldn't get far.

36:10.574 --> 36:11.903
- Hurry up, they're coming!

36:17.515 --> 36:18.448
- Come on, big man!

36:19.649 --> 36:21.616
- Come on, get up!
Fucking move!

36:21.651 --> 36:22.485
- Come on, big man.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.763
- Oh God!

36:37.700 --> 36:38.732
Get it off! Fuck!

36:38.767 --> 36:39.568
- Come on,
come on!

36:45.037 --> 36:45.871
- Come on!

36:52.913 --> 36:54.715
- Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

36:54.750 --> 36:55.782
- Come on, give me your hand!

36:55.817 --> 36:57.421
Give me your hand!

37:05.992 --> 37:08.300
- Give me your hand!

37:08.335 --> 37:09.961
Leon, give me your
hand! Give me your hand!

37:09.996 --> 37:10.863
Leon, give me your hand!

37:13.703 --> 37:15.835
- Come on, Leon! Come on!

37:15.870 --> 37:17.408
Leon, come on!

37:18.609 --> 37:19.872
Pull yourself up, Leon!

37:19.907 --> 37:20.741
Leon, come on!

37:21.711 --> 37:22.743
Leon, pull yourself up!

37:22.778 --> 37:23.777
- You're gonna be all right.

37:23.812 --> 37:24.712
You're gonna be all right.

37:24.747 --> 37:25.548
- Pull yourself up!

37:25.583 --> 37:26.384
Leon, no! No!

37:26.419 --> 37:27.451
Leon!

37:27.486 --> 37:28.045
- Leon, no!

37:28.850 --> 37:29.750
No, Leon!

38:22.475 --> 38:25.641
- We find some proper
weapons and we go back.

38:25.676 --> 38:28.842
Slaughter them like the
pigs they are.

38:30.912 --> 38:33.044
- I don't want to murder anyone.

38:33.079 --> 38:34.947
- It ain't murder, it's revenge.

38:34.982 --> 38:36.982
An eye for an eye. You've
heard of that, right?

38:37.017 --> 38:38.489
It's in the Bible.

38:38.524 --> 38:39.886
- Well, I just want to go home.

38:39.921 --> 38:41.888
- What, and let them
get away with it?

38:44.123 --> 38:45.023
- Tod's right.

38:46.126 --> 38:47.861
- Don't tell me you don't
want to rip their heads off!

38:47.896 --> 38:49.467
- Of course I do.

38:50.866 --> 38:53.438
But there's too many of them.

38:55.035 --> 38:56.573
- And Leon?

38:56.608 --> 38:59.906
- Leon would have wanted
us to get out of here.

39:00.843 --> 39:03.910
We get payback on our
terms, not theirs.

39:18.058 --> 39:21.895
- One down, three to go.

39:21.930 --> 39:22.962
- What's wrong, boy?

39:24.064 --> 39:25.030
- Nothing.

39:25.065 --> 39:26.570
- Spit it out, boy.

39:28.101 --> 39:29.672
- Truth be told,

39:29.707 --> 39:31.102
I expected things to be
a little more hands on.

39:33.106 --> 39:34.974
- You'll get your chance.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.111
- It looks like we've
got a live one.

39:41.818 --> 39:42.718
- Wait.

39:54.732 --> 39:55.632
Miles

40:05.908 --> 40:07.171
- Why?

40:07.206 --> 40:10.680
- This country used to be
ruled by lions.

40:11.617 --> 40:14.717
Now it is led by lambs.

40:14.752 --> 40:16.752
As far as we're concerned,

40:16.787 --> 40:19.557
lambs are only good
for one thing.

40:21.660 --> 40:22.560
- Slaughter.

40:32.803 --> 40:34.803
- Don't you dare waste
a moment like this

40:34.838 --> 40:35.969
looking through a lens.

40:36.004 --> 40:37.971
- Your
father's right.

40:38.006 --> 40:39.544
- This is tradition.

40:39.579 --> 40:42.008
- It's tradition that
makes us strong.

40:44.012 --> 40:45.781
Wear this blood with pride.

40:46.685 --> 40:48.487
It is your birthright.

40:49.919 --> 40:51.853
He was right.

40:51.888 --> 40:53.954
Red is his colour.

40:53.989 --> 40:55.956
- Congratulations, son.

40:56.893 --> 40:58.959
May it be the first of many.

40:58.994 --> 41:00.092
- Hear
- Hear.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.722
- Go on, give me your hand.

41:27.253 --> 41:29.220
- Wrap that back round.

41:31.356 --> 41:36.601
All right?
- Yeah.

42:21.208 --> 42:23.142
- I told you it was a road.

42:23.177 --> 42:24.649
- At last.

42:24.684 --> 42:26.145
- Yeah, but which way do we go?

42:30.987 --> 42:32.756
- Let's get the fuck
out of here.

42:37.026 --> 42:38.630
- Wait, someone's coming.

42:40.964 --> 42:43.195
- Thank God.

42:43.230 --> 42:45.329
- Wait, Tod, it could
be one of them.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.675
- The fucker in the 4x4.

43:22.236 --> 43:26.975
- Red one, red one,
this is Mallory.

43:28.814 --> 43:30.308
Looks like we found one of them.

43:31.718 --> 43:32.915
I'm over at Bench Hill.

43:34.721 --> 43:36.347
A girl, looks like.

43:38.054 --> 43:40.153
Don't know where the others are.

43:40.188 --> 43:42.452
- Good,
we're heading your way.

43:42.487 --> 43:43.860
- Yes, milady.

43:45.897 --> 43:46.591
Right.

43:50.462 --> 43:51.428
Well, well.

43:54.741 --> 43:57.203
What happened to you, my lovely?

43:57.238 --> 43:58.743
- Boo!

44:00.780 --> 44:01.878
- Come on!

44:02.474 --> 44:03.341
Let's go!

44:07.479 --> 44:10.480
- Vix, let's go so that we
can get the fuck out of here!

44:15.487 --> 44:16.959
Vix!

44:19.359 --> 44:20.391
Vix!

44:26.773 --> 44:27.838
- Come on, bro, punch it!

44:27.873 --> 44:30.170
- Where the fuck are the keys?

44:31.371 --> 44:32.469
He must have them.

44:32.504 --> 44:33.745
- Can't you just
hot-wire this shit?

44:33.780 --> 44:34.878
- Yeah, I need to open this.

44:34.913 --> 44:35.945
- We need those keys!

44:35.980 --> 44:37.078
- He's not gonna give it to us!

44:37.113 --> 44:38.442
- I ain't planning on
asking nicely.

44:41.854 --> 44:42.754
- Fuck!

44:42.789 --> 44:43.821
Fuck!

44:43.856 --> 44:48.485
Bro, come on. We've got to run.

44:53.833 --> 44:55.294
Come on, come on, let's
head over to the trees!

45:07.847 --> 45:09.143
- You okay there, Mallory?

45:09.178 --> 45:12.080
- Yeah, ma'am, I'm fine.

45:12.951 --> 45:14.544
Smart ones, these bastards.

45:14.579 --> 45:18.185
One of 'em played possum,
the other blindsided me.

45:18.220 --> 45:19.384
- Bloody ambush.

45:19.419 --> 45:20.451
- We're lucky they
didn't take the car.

45:20.486 --> 45:21.386
They'd be long gone by now.

45:21.421 --> 45:23.157
- No, sir.

45:24.127 --> 45:25.489
That'd never happen.

45:25.524 --> 45:28.063
- Good man. Now get
yourself patched up.

45:28.934 --> 45:30.802
The show must go on.

45:39.439 --> 45:40.339
- Look.

45:42.145 --> 45:43.848
They're tyre tracks.

45:43.883 --> 45:45.344
There must be a farm near here.

45:46.314 --> 45:47.412
- They might have car.

45:47.447 --> 45:49.348
- Yeah, or a phone.

45:50.615 --> 45:52.186
- Who you gonna call?

45:52.221 --> 45:53.418
- The fucking Ghostbusters!

45:53.453 --> 45:55.893
Who do you think? The police!

45:55.928 --> 45:58.489
- Leon's dead. What good is
it bringing feds into it?

45:58.524 --> 46:00.326
- But we have no clue
where we are.

46:00.361 --> 46:03.065
- Listen, you may be clean,
but we have priors, yeah.

46:03.100 --> 46:04.165
They gonna start asking
what we're doing up here

46:04.200 --> 46:06.035
and we end up doing time.

46:06.070 --> 46:07.564
I won't let 'em lock me up,
Chaz.

46:09.535 --> 46:11.205
- They'll have a car
or something.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.536
We'll make our own way out.

46:16.641 --> 46:17.981
- How do they keep finding us?

46:18.016 --> 46:18.916
- Shit.

46:26.618 --> 46:27.518
- It's me.

46:30.457 --> 46:32.127
Look, I'll lead them away.

46:32.162 --> 46:34.195
- No, look, we should
just stay together.

46:34.230 --> 46:35.427
- No, no, no.

46:35.462 --> 46:36.560
I'll double back, I'll
follow the tracks.

46:36.595 --> 46:38.067
I'll meet you at the farm.

46:39.004 --> 46:40.333
Trust me, I can do this.

46:42.909 --> 46:44.403
I'll see you there.

46:45.670 --> 46:47.472
- All right, you'd better.

46:47.507 --> 46:49.078
- Go.

46:49.113 --> 46:50.475
Go!

48:16.431 --> 48:18.728
- I don't think
anyone's home.

48:25.539 --> 48:27.242
- Reckon you
can start that motor?

48:27.277 --> 48:29.079
- No, I'm gonna need some keys.

48:43.755 --> 48:45.524
Where'd you learn to do that?

48:45.559 --> 48:47.526
- Stepdad used to beat the
shit out of us growing up.

48:49.266 --> 48:51.398
Then he'd lock us in
until the bruises cleared.

48:51.433 --> 48:53.301
One night, after God
knows how long trying,

48:53.336 --> 48:55.699
I managed to spring
the lock in my room.

48:55.734 --> 48:56.700
- Did you run away?

48:58.143 --> 48:59.076
- The fuck I did.

49:00.145 --> 49:03.113
I poured boiling water on
his balls whilst he slept.

49:03.148 --> 49:06.083
That's the last time anyone
ever laid a hand on me or Mum.

49:06.745 --> 49:09.713
And the last time anyone
ever locked me up.

49:43.452 --> 49:47.487
- Right, ma'am, I reckon
their trail split.

49:47.522 --> 49:49.291
- Then so must we.

49:49.326 --> 49:52.129
- Miles and I will head
east, travel light and fast.

49:52.164 --> 49:54.329
Fetch me the hound with
the finest nose, will you?

49:54.364 --> 49:57.233
- We'll head west and
circle round.

49:57.268 --> 49:59.334
- Ready when you are, sir.

50:31.170 --> 50:32.301
- Let's find those keys.

51:00.463 --> 51:03.101
That's what I'm talking about.

51:22.518 --> 51:23.418
- Whoa.

51:26.258 --> 51:29.259
- Relax, Charlie.
There's no shells.

51:29.294 --> 51:31.129
- Don't call me that.

51:31.956 --> 51:34.231
- What's wrong with "Charlie"?
It's your name, innit?

51:34.266 --> 51:35.760
- Only my mum called me Charlie.

51:41.669 --> 51:42.833
- This is all my fault.

51:45.607 --> 51:46.804
Leon was done.

51:48.445 --> 51:50.478
He'd paid my fees.
He was ready to walk.

51:53.549 --> 51:55.582
Now he's dead because of me.

51:58.323 --> 52:00.257
Tod's somewhere out there
because of me,

52:00.292 --> 52:02.919
and we're stuck here
because of me.

52:04.527 --> 52:07.429
All of it is on me.

52:21.478 --> 52:23.907
- Listen, I ain't all
about rubbing your back

52:23.942 --> 52:25.612
and telling you that
everything's gonna be okay.

52:25.647 --> 52:27.251
Yeah, that just ain't me.

52:31.554 --> 52:33.389
We're in the shit here, bro.

52:35.426 --> 52:37.723
And I ain't sure how
we're gonna get out of it.

52:40.794 --> 52:43.300
One thing I do know for
absolute certain

52:44.369 --> 52:46.666
is Leon didn't do shit
that he didn't wanna do.

52:48.934 --> 52:51.242
We all knew the risks.

52:51.277 --> 52:53.541
Well, not crazy-motherfuckers
-on-horseback-level risk,

52:53.576 --> 52:54.542
but you get me.

52:58.812 --> 52:59.877
This ain't on you.

53:01.980 --> 53:03.947
And thinking it's only gonna
put a weight on your shoulders

53:03.982 --> 53:07.225
that you can't afford to be
carrying right now, you hear me?

53:09.394 --> 53:10.294
Hm?

53:21.373 --> 53:22.273
Okay.

53:39.886 --> 53:41.050
- They've found something.

53:41.085 --> 53:42.458
Go on, leave it, leave it,
leave it,

53:42.493 --> 53:45.659
leave it, leave it,
leave it, leave it.

53:47.696 --> 53:48.728
What the devil?

53:50.732 --> 53:54.470
- Well, Uncle, we seem
to have been led astray.

53:54.505 --> 53:56.373
- Now that's downright sly.

54:09.454 --> 54:10.750
- What the fuck?

54:23.369 --> 54:25.732
- Chaz, get your arse in here!

54:39.077 --> 54:40.384
This is good.

54:53.432 --> 54:54.563
- Mallory?

54:54.598 --> 54:55.399
- Oh.

54:55.434 --> 54:56.697
ma'am.

54:57.601 --> 54:58.930
Ma'am.

54:58.965 --> 55:00.569
- The trail
has gone cold our end.

55:00.604 --> 55:01.702
Any luck down river?

55:01.737 --> 55:05.475
- Oh, no. I'm as far
as Peel Bridge.

55:05.510 --> 55:07.037
They can't have got this far.

55:07.072 --> 55:08.709
- Agreed.

55:08.744 --> 55:10.073
Make your way back to
the rendezvous point,

55:10.108 --> 55:11.712
and we'll catch up
with my brother.

55:11.747 --> 55:12.878
- All right, ma'am.

55:15.080 --> 55:15.980
Oh.

55:18.853 --> 55:19.753
Bollocks.

56:09.871 --> 56:11.772
- All right, you
little bastards!

56:27.053 --> 56:28.624
- Tell me what you see.

56:30.628 --> 56:33.156
- Fresh tracks heading
right inside.

56:33.191 --> 56:34.861
- Tremendous.

56:34.896 --> 56:36.632
- So now what?

56:36.667 --> 56:39.800
- Now we've located our quarry,
we must flush it out here.

56:40.737 --> 56:41.637
Here.

56:48.613 --> 56:51.548

56:51.583 --> 56:55.651

56:55.686 --> 56:57.048

You hold here.

57:13.638 --> 57:14.703
I'll go around the back
and chase 'em out.

57:14.738 --> 57:16.067
You have the blade?

57:16.102 --> 57:17.002
Good.

57:18.841 --> 57:21.545
Whistle. If they bolt,
you blow hard.

57:24.275 --> 57:26.209
- Shouldn't we wait
for the others?

57:26.244 --> 57:27.782
- Share the prize?

57:28.884 --> 57:30.246
They're nothing.

57:30.281 --> 57:32.017
You're worth a dozen
of every one of them.

57:32.052 --> 57:33.887
- Forgive me, Father.

57:33.922 --> 57:36.021
- Listen, you're turning into
a man before my very eyes.

57:36.056 --> 57:37.693
I couldn't be more proud of you.

57:41.963 --> 57:42.962
- He's going round the back.

57:42.997 --> 57:43.897
- Is the door locked?

57:47.903 --> 57:48.869
- Grab the gun and
watch that door!

57:48.904 --> 57:50.200
- But it's not loaded!

57:50.235 --> 57:55.271

58:40.021 --> 58:41.284

hold forever.

58:41.319 --> 58:42.252
- What's that for?

58:42.287 --> 58:43.594
- To confuse the dogs.

58:47.633 --> 58:48.599
- Turn on the gas.

58:49.360 --> 58:50.832
- What you doing?

58:51.802 --> 58:53.164
- Confusing the humans.

58:56.774 --> 58:57.905
We need to take cover.

58:58.974 --> 59:00.006
- Storeroom!

59:09.820 --> 59:13.789
- Close it!

59:25.165 --> 59:28.166
- You know what happened when
the wolf became impatient?

59:29.708 --> 59:31.037
He huffed!

59:33.008 --> 59:34.370
- Father, I'm in.

59:35.714 --> 59:37.681
- And he puffed!

59:41.720 --> 59:44.083
And he blew the house down!

59:54.931 --> 59:55.765
Miles.

59:56.966 --> 59:58.933
- That came from the farm.

59:58.968 --> 1:00:00.000
Hyah!

1:00:03.940 --> 1:00:05.742
- Miles!

1:00:07.713 --> 1:00:08.943
Miles!

Miles!

1:00:19.153 --> 1:00:20.350
Miles!

1:00:21.892 --> 1:00:22.792
Miles!

1:00:24.455 --> 1:00:25.696
Miles!

1:00:39.877 --> 1:00:40.777
Miles?

1:00:43.441 --> 1:00:45.749
Oh, my God, Miles! Miles!

1:00:47.214 --> 1:00:48.114
Miles?

1:00:52.318 --> 1:00:53.955
- That was insane!

1:00:55.794 --> 1:00:57.222
- I never meant to.

1:00:57.257 --> 1:00:58.729
That was supposed to be
a distraction.

1:00:59.864 --> 1:01:01.193
- Yeah, consider
them distracted.

1:01:01.228 --> 1:01:02.293
Come on, let's get
the hell out of here.

1:01:02.328 --> 1:01:04.493
- Holy shit! Did you see that?

1:01:04.528 --> 1:01:05.802
- Jesus Christ, see it?

1:01:05.837 --> 1:01:07.870
Meet the twisted fire starter.

1:01:07.905 --> 1:01:09.003
- Wait, that was you?

1:01:11.073 --> 1:01:12.039
You made it back then?

1:01:12.074 --> 1:01:12.908
- Man of my word.

1:01:12.943 --> 1:01:13.843
- Yeah, right.

1:01:14.538 --> 1:01:15.812
Come on!

1:01:15.847 --> 1:01:16.945
Come on, bro!

1:01:31.258 --> 1:01:32.455
- Dear God.

1:01:32.490 --> 1:01:34.325
- I underestimated our quarry.

1:01:37.869 --> 1:01:39.297
It won't happen again.

1:01:57.284 --> 1:01:59.416
- Relax, the spray
covers your scent.

1:02:05.457 --> 1:02:07.160
- Did they not have Lynx Africa?

1:02:08.592 --> 1:02:11.263
Oh, wait, look! I
just remembered.

1:02:13.135 --> 1:02:14.365
- Where'd that come from?

1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:15.806
- It's one of theirs.

1:02:15.841 --> 1:02:16.433
- Does it still work?

1:02:16.468 --> 1:02:18.105
- I don't know.

1:02:19.878 --> 1:02:20.943
- They must have some
sort of emergency channel.

1:02:22.408 --> 1:02:23.440
- When are you gonna
get it into your head?

1:02:23.475 --> 1:02:24.540
We're on our own!

1:02:24.575 --> 1:02:26.146
This is fighting to
survive here!

1:02:26.181 --> 1:02:27.950
It's kill or be killed,
whatever it takes, man!

1:02:27.985 --> 1:02:29.347
Wake the fuck up!

1:02:29.382 --> 1:02:30.447
Jesus!

1:02:41.361 --> 1:02:43.097
- Hell of a thing to lose a son.

1:02:45.002 --> 1:02:47.200
Is this going to be a problem?

1:02:47.235 --> 1:02:50.137
- Hugo, this is a dog hunt.

1:02:50.172 --> 1:02:52.040
- Listen to
your sister, Hugo.

1:02:52.075 --> 1:02:53.877
- I loved Miles like a son.

1:02:53.912 --> 1:02:56.242
- This was his day,
and they killed him.

1:02:58.048 --> 1:02:59.344
- Remember the code.

1:03:00.248 --> 1:03:01.082
- Fuck the code!

1:03:02.052 --> 1:03:03.480
- Mallory, leave him be.

1:03:07.453 --> 1:03:08.518
There will be consequences.

1:03:08.553 --> 1:03:09.453
- Always are.

1:03:12.161 --> 1:03:14.029
- No excuses, that was bad form.

1:03:15.593 --> 1:03:18.968
So, what now?

1:03:35.151 --> 1:03:36.854
- Wait, I recognise this place.

1:03:41.157 --> 1:03:42.860
- Where are all the signs?

1:03:44.688 --> 1:03:45.962
- They took 'em down.

1:03:47.394 --> 1:03:49.493
- Fuck!

1:03:49.528 --> 1:03:51.396
Oh, for fuck's sake!

1:03:51.431 --> 1:03:53.904
Man, we're gonna die out here!

1:03:53.939 --> 1:03:55.565
- Don't say that, all right?

1:03:55.600 --> 1:03:57.908
We're gonna get out of here.

1:04:00.242 --> 1:04:02.946
- Can you hear me?

1:04:02.981 --> 1:04:04.981
We know you have
Mallory's radio.

1:04:06.710 --> 1:04:09.887
Oh, don't be shy. Say hello.

1:04:11.286 --> 1:04:12.252
- Maybe they don't have it?

1:04:12.287 --> 1:04:13.583
- Oh, they've got it.

1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:17.620
- You made quite the mess
of things here at the farm.

1:04:17.655 --> 1:04:20.128
Was that your idea of
getting even?

1:04:20.163 --> 1:04:21.591
- Oh, we ain't
even started

1:04:21.626 --> 1:04:23.197
on getting even, lady.

1:04:23.232 --> 1:04:24.132
- There you are.

1:04:26.202 --> 1:04:28.664
- We called for help.
Police are on their way.

1:04:28.699 --> 1:04:31.007
- Oh, please,
there's nobody within range

1:04:31.042 --> 1:04:32.602
who could possibly be
of assistance.

1:04:32.637 --> 1:04:33.977
- Bullshit.

1:04:34.012 --> 1:04:35.979
- I have no
reason to lie.

1:04:38.016 --> 1:04:39.642
- Why are you doing this?

1:04:39.677 --> 1:04:42.612
- You came into
my world, not I into yours.

1:04:42.647 --> 1:04:43.954
You broke into my home,

1:04:43.989 --> 1:04:46.583
and now you are
paying the price.

1:04:47.751 --> 1:04:51.324
But fear not, it will
be over soon.

1:04:51.359 --> 1:04:54.096
- This isn't over until you
pay for what you did to Leon.

1:04:55.297 --> 1:04:56.626
- You still don't get it,
do you?

1:04:58.234 --> 1:05:00.531
This is my land.

1:05:02.073 --> 1:05:02.731
All of it.

1:05:04.372 --> 1:05:06.636
You are trespassers...

1:05:07.738 --> 1:05:10.541
and you live or die by my hand.

1:05:12.050 --> 1:05:16.646
There is no refuge.
There is no escape.

1:05:16.681 --> 1:05:19.121
There is only the hunt.

1:05:20.685 --> 1:05:23.158
- You're one sick
bitch, you know that?

1:05:24.095 --> 1:05:25.490
- See you soon, Charlie.

1:05:35.172 --> 1:05:37.601
- This shit is so fucked!

1:05:37.636 --> 1:05:39.141
- Just calm down.
- Calm down?

1:05:40.243 --> 1:05:41.572
Did you hear how crazy
that bitch is?

1:05:41.607 --> 1:05:42.771
Are you joking?

1:05:42.806 --> 1:05:44.014
- Took you this long
to figure that out?

1:05:46.249 --> 1:05:47.743
- So now what?

1:05:47.778 --> 1:05:49.019
- Yeah, he's right.

1:05:49.054 --> 1:05:50.449
You're the smart one. Now what?

1:05:52.189 --> 1:05:53.089
- Okay.

1:05:54.356 --> 1:05:55.256
Okay, look.

1:05:57.095 --> 1:05:59.557
We've been running around
with no sense of direction.

1:05:59.592 --> 1:06:02.791
If we get high enough, we
might be able to see something.

1:06:13.672 --> 1:06:16.013
- Are you sure about this,
Chazza?

1:06:17.775 --> 1:06:19.676
- Only one way to find out.

1:06:19.711 --> 1:06:21.315
- No. Look, you got
a busted leg.

1:06:21.350 --> 1:06:22.250
I'll do it.

1:06:23.451 --> 1:06:24.780
Unless...

1:06:25.816 --> 1:06:27.552
- No, you go for it.

1:06:27.587 --> 1:06:29.653
When it comes to stunts of
death-defying stupidity,

1:06:29.688 --> 1:06:32.161
I consider chivalry
alive and well.

1:06:38.367 --> 1:06:40.235
- Okay, can you give me a boost?

1:06:40.270 --> 1:06:42.237
- Yeah.

1:06:42.272 --> 1:06:43.304
- Right, cool.

1:06:43.339 --> 1:06:44.305
- Put your foot on there.

1:06:44.340 --> 1:06:45.240
- Ready?
- Yep.

1:07:01.852 --> 1:07:03.192
- Can you see anything?

1:07:03.227 --> 1:07:04.787
- Nah, not yet. I need
to get higher.

1:07:10.894 --> 1:07:11.827
- You thought about
what we're going to do

1:07:11.862 --> 1:07:13.070
when we get out here?

1:07:16.339 --> 1:07:18.504
Is he gonna be able to
keep his mouth shut?

1:07:21.740 --> 1:07:23.344
I just hate the idea
of surviving this shit

1:07:23.379 --> 1:07:25.247
only to fall foul of
his guilty conscience.

1:07:25.282 --> 1:07:26.314
You know what I mean?

1:07:35.259 --> 1:07:37.886
- I see something! It's
beyond those woods.

1:07:37.921 --> 1:07:39.492
I think it's the village
that we passed.

1:07:39.527 --> 1:07:41.164
- How far?

1:07:41.199 --> 1:07:42.330
- Couple of miles.

1:07:42.365 --> 1:07:43.298
- Hm.

1:07:44.730 --> 1:07:46.301
- Chaz, get down quick,
they're coming!

1:07:46.336 --> 1:07:47.434
- Shit.
- Get down here!

1:07:49.273 --> 1:07:52.142
- Come on, we need to
get to those trees!

1:07:53.838 --> 1:07:55.475
Come on, bro, move
your skinny arse!

1:07:55.510 --> 1:07:57.510
Come on!
- Come on.

1:07:57.545 --> 1:07:58.709
- Quick!

1:07:59.712 --> 1:08:01.382
- All right, let's go!

1:08:32.745 --> 1:08:34.316
Come on, come on.

1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:39.651
- Stop, stop!

1:08:42.458 --> 1:08:43.754
Just go! I'm slowing you down!

1:08:43.789 --> 1:08:45.591
- Fuck that, man!
We're almost out!

1:08:49.630 --> 1:08:51.366
- Ah, that don't look right,
Chaz.

1:08:52.567 --> 1:08:54.666
- I can't put
weight on it, just go!

1:08:55.834 --> 1:08:57.405
- You think we're
leaving you behind?

1:08:57.440 --> 1:08:58.967
After everything we've
been through?

1:09:10.255 --> 1:09:11.353
- They know we're here!

1:09:11.388 --> 1:09:15.357
Come on, let's get him up!

1:09:15.392 --> 1:09:16.853
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:09:19.693 --> 1:09:20.857
Come, come on.

1:09:22.267 --> 1:09:24.234
- No, I'm too slow! Just go!

1:09:24.269 --> 1:09:26.797
- Listen, just keep heading
in that direction, okay?

1:09:26.832 --> 1:09:28.964
The village is on the other
side of these trees, all right?

1:09:28.999 --> 1:09:30.339
We'll catch up.

1:09:30.374 --> 1:09:31.703
- No, no. I'm not
leaving you behind.

1:09:31.738 --> 1:09:33.804
- Listen! We're making
it out of this together.

1:09:33.839 --> 1:09:35.674
You're just going ahead.

1:09:35.709 --> 1:09:37.544
- Yeah, what about us?

1:09:37.579 --> 1:09:38.710
- We're done running.

1:09:43.849 --> 1:09:45.882
- If they make it
through the forest,

1:09:45.917 --> 1:09:47.422
they'll land on top
of the village.

1:09:49.393 --> 1:09:50.953
Amused?

1:09:50.988 --> 1:09:53.527
- Impressed. I never thought
they'd make it this far.

1:09:53.562 --> 1:09:54.495
- Hm.

1:09:57.731 --> 1:09:58.994
What the devil is that?

1:10:04.408 --> 1:10:05.935
- Come get us!

1:10:05.970 --> 1:10:08.278
Come on, you inbred bastards!

1:10:08.313 --> 1:10:09.774
You want us, you
come and get us!

1:10:09.809 --> 1:10:11.578
Come on!
- Come on!

1:10:11.613 --> 1:10:13.283
- In all my days, I've never
heard anything like it.

1:10:13.318 --> 1:10:15.879
- Well, they've got heart.
I'll give them that.

1:10:43.843 --> 1:10:46.415
- Your running days are over.

1:10:55.052 --> 1:10:59.725
It's an uncivilised weapon
for an uncivilised age.

1:11:12.036 --> 1:11:13.442
Something amusing you?

1:11:15.578 --> 1:11:17.710
- It's true what they
say about you people.

1:11:19.780 --> 1:11:21.076
You all marry your cousins.

1:11:23.487 --> 1:11:25.817
No wonder you're so
fucking insane.

1:11:25.852 --> 1:11:27.687
- You have the audacity
to look down on me

1:11:27.722 --> 1:11:29.920
when you're not even from here?

1:11:30.890 --> 1:11:32.791
- No, I'm from Peckham!

1:12:01.151 --> 1:12:03.591
You brought this on yourself!

1:12:37.055 --> 1:12:37.955
- Tod.

1:12:39.662 --> 1:12:40.496
- Hugo?

1:12:42.126 --> 1:12:43.928
Damn fool.

1:12:43.963 --> 1:12:46.865
- I'm sorry, ma'am, the dogs
are getting a bit snappy.

1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:48.163
- They're tired.

1:12:48.198 --> 1:12:49.967
- I know how they feel.

1:12:50.002 --> 1:12:53.443
- I think it's time for you
to call it a day, Uncle.

1:12:53.478 --> 1:12:54.807
- And our quarry?

1:12:54.842 --> 1:12:57.139
- From now on, I hunt alone.

1:13:22.903 --> 1:13:24.804
- Come on, chop, chop.

1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:30.040
- Sir.

1:13:34.552 --> 1:13:35.881
It's been a while, sir.

1:13:35.916 --> 1:13:39.181
Do you think ma'am
is gonna be all right?

1:13:39.216 --> 1:13:41.788
- Of course. She's a Redwick.

1:13:43.022 --> 1:13:44.593
- Very good, sir.

1:14:01.777 --> 1:14:02.743
- Dear God.

1:14:05.077 --> 1:14:06.648
This is barbaric.

1:14:07.651 --> 1:14:09.519
- This is justice.

1:14:10.687 --> 1:14:13.622
They're animals, nothing more.

1:14:14.691 --> 1:14:16.922
- When we abandon civility,

1:14:16.957 --> 1:14:19.958
we become no better than
the animals we hunt!

1:14:19.993 --> 1:14:21.190
- They killed my boy.

1:14:22.226 --> 1:14:24.226
- You turned your
back on the code.

1:14:25.603 --> 1:14:28.197
On history, on tradition.

1:14:29.167 --> 1:14:31.805
- Takes one bad dog to
ruin the hunt.

1:14:39.111 --> 1:14:42.651
- That's the difference between
a hunter and a fisherman.

1:14:44.314 --> 1:14:49.559
A hunter lies in wait, and
a fisherman waits and lies.

1:15:01.364 --> 1:15:03.067
Don't do anything rash.

1:15:05.203 --> 1:15:07.874
- On your knees. All of ya!

1:15:08.844 --> 1:15:10.613
Hands behind your heads.

1:15:10.648 --> 1:15:13.011
- You are in a lot of trouble.

1:15:17.622 --> 1:15:20.183
- What's up? You don't
like the taste of piss?

1:15:21.956 --> 1:15:23.857
Tie 'em up. All of 'em.

1:15:39.039 --> 1:15:43.206
- So, what's your plan?

1:15:43.241 --> 1:15:44.647
- Shut the fuck up.

1:15:45.683 --> 1:15:47.848
- Have you any idea who I am?

1:15:47.883 --> 1:15:50.653
- Yeah. You're an antique.

1:15:54.087 --> 1:15:55.625
I mean it, old man, get back!

1:15:55.660 --> 1:15:57.154
- You're not going to shoot me.

1:16:00.192 --> 1:16:01.257
You ever fired a gun?

1:16:04.768 --> 1:16:07.098
Pulling the trigger is
much harder than it looks.

1:16:15.339 --> 1:16:18.648
- There's more guns on my
estate than there is on yours.

1:16:19.717 --> 1:16:21.145
- Vix!

1:16:26.317 --> 1:16:28.658
Why won't you fucking die?

1:16:40.034 --> 1:16:41.737
Release the hounds!

1:16:45.435 --> 1:16:47.710
- We're almost out.

1:16:47.745 --> 1:16:50.108
- We're not almost out anywhere,
we're surrounded by trees.

1:16:58.217 --> 1:16:59.348
- Let's go!
We're almost out!

1:16:59.383 --> 1:17:00.888
- We're not
almost out anywhere!

1:17:00.923 --> 1:17:03.693
We're surrounded by trees, Chaz!

1:17:03.728 --> 1:17:04.386
Watch where you're going!

1:17:04.421 --> 1:17:05.321
- Come on!

1:17:05.356 --> 1:17:06.157
- Watch the tree!

1:17:07.930 --> 1:17:09.259
- We're nearly
there! We're nearly there!

1:17:09.294 --> 1:17:10.194
- Chaz, slow down!
- Hold on, hold on.

1:17:10.229 --> 1:17:10.997
- I'm holding on.

1:17:12.803 --> 1:17:13.868
- Look out for the
lights from the village.

1:17:13.903 --> 1:17:15.364
- I'm looking
for the lights

1:17:15.399 --> 1:17:16.464
but I can't see anything!
- We're almost out.

1:17:16.499 --> 1:17:18.004
- You're going too fast!

1:17:20.437 --> 1:17:22.338
Chaz, I can't see
where we're going!

1:17:22.373 --> 1:17:24.208
Will you slow down?

1:17:24.243 --> 1:17:26.111
Shit, Chaz!
- Fuck!

1:17:26.146 --> 1:17:26.980
Hold on, hold on!

1:17:48.300 --> 1:17:49.497
- No, no, no!

1:17:52.975 --> 1:17:53.875
I'm sorry!

1:17:54.911 --> 1:17:57.109
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

1:17:57.144 --> 1:17:58.110
This is gonna hurt.

1:17:59.212 --> 1:18:00.508
Just don't move, don't move.

1:18:02.545 --> 1:18:04.083
We're almost there.

1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:19.164
Come on.

1:18:22.202 --> 1:18:23.234
No.

1:18:23.269 --> 1:18:24.169
Come on, we're almost there!

1:18:24.204 --> 1:18:25.203
We're almost there!

1:18:54.201 --> 1:18:55.266
No, no, no!

1:18:55.301 --> 1:18:57.433
No, come on, come on, come on!

1:18:57.468 --> 1:18:59.105
Vix, come on!

1:18:59.140 --> 1:19:00.205
Come on. We're almost there.

1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:01.437
Come on, Vix.

1:19:01.472 --> 1:19:03.373
- Let me go. Let me go.

1:19:04.574 --> 1:19:05.947
Let me go.

1:19:05.982 --> 1:19:08.312
- Come on, Vix, please!

1:19:08.347 --> 1:19:11.249
- Not me, man, I'm done.
I'm done.

1:19:12.549 --> 1:19:14.824
Chaz, listen, I'm done, man.

1:19:19.325 --> 1:19:20.863
Go.

1:19:20.898 --> 1:19:21.798
Go.

1:19:24.396 --> 1:19:25.967
- I'm not going.

1:19:26.002 --> 1:19:28.332
- Not just from here. Go.

1:19:28.367 --> 1:19:30.004
Get off the manor.

1:19:32.943 --> 1:19:33.843
Be good.

1:19:36.243 --> 1:19:37.880
Swear you will, Charlie.

1:19:41.215 --> 1:19:43.116
Swear that you will,
Charlie. Swear it.

1:19:43.151 --> 1:19:45.921
- I swear, I swear, I swear,
I swear.

1:19:47.925 --> 1:19:48.550
Come on.

1:19:48.585 --> 1:19:49.485
- Go.

1:19:51.027 --> 1:19:51.993
Fucking go!

1:20:30.429 --> 1:20:31.494
- The boy got away?

1:20:41.011 --> 1:20:43.308
This stuff is older
than you are.

1:20:51.384 --> 1:20:52.548
- Tastes rank.

1:20:53.485 --> 1:20:54.389
- I agree.

1:21:44.371 --> 1:21:46.470
- Where've you come from?

1:21:48.474 --> 1:21:50.177
You're half frozen!

1:21:52.709 --> 1:21:54.016
Are you okay?

1:21:56.218 --> 1:21:57.184
Are you injured?

1:21:57.219 --> 1:21:59.054
- This is not my blood.

1:22:01.652 --> 1:22:05.126
- I'm gonna call the police.

1:22:06.261 --> 1:22:08.525
Eddie, get the boy a drink.

1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:09.559
- Who did this, son?

1:22:13.136 --> 1:22:14.630
- They chased us.

1:22:14.665 --> 1:22:15.499
- Who did?

1:22:17.602 --> 1:22:19.107
- With dogs.

1:22:19.142 --> 1:22:20.570
- Dogs?

1:22:20.605 --> 1:22:22.341
We'd better lock this door,
Jude.

1:22:36.291 --> 1:22:37.323
- Come on, drink up.

1:22:39.294 --> 1:22:40.326
You're safe with us.

1:22:43.694 --> 1:22:44.660
You hungry?

1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:50.237
How about a bacon sandwich?

1:22:52.208 --> 1:22:53.108
Yes?

1:22:54.507 --> 1:22:55.737
Now, that'll do nicely.

1:23:30.774 --> 1:23:32.477
- Hey, don't you worry lad.

1:23:32.512 --> 1:23:33.643
You'll be safe in here.

1:23:33.678 --> 1:23:34.809
- Wait!

1:23:36.417 --> 1:23:38.087
- Oh, shit!
- You'll be safe in here!

1:23:38.122 --> 1:23:41.420
- Help me, help me!
Please help me!

1:23:47.824 --> 1:23:50.231
- It's all right,
everything's gonna be okay.

1:23:50.266 --> 1:23:54.301
Let's get you back, see if we
can sort this bloody mess out.

1:23:54.336 --> 1:23:56.798
I'm gonna to get you home.
It's all over

1:24:12.453 --> 1:24:16.851
How many of your friends
did you say they were?

1:24:16.886 --> 1:24:17.786
- Three.

1:24:18.888 --> 1:24:19.821
- Shit.

1:24:26.467 --> 1:24:28.137
What you doing up here, anyway?

1:24:42.582 --> 1:24:44.351
- Hey, you've gone
the wrong way.

1:24:45.189 --> 1:24:45.880
- There've
been a lot of robberies

1:24:45.915 --> 1:24:47.321
around here lately.

1:24:49.457 --> 1:24:50.885
- Hey, where the fuck
are we going?

1:24:55.826 --> 1:24:59.267
Where are you taking me?
Let me out now!

1:24:59.302 --> 1:25:00.730
No, no! Get me the fuck
out of here, now!

1:25:00.765 --> 1:25:02.204
Get me the fuck out of here,
now!

1:25:02.965 --> 1:25:04.437
No! Let me out now!

1:25:04.472 --> 1:25:05.702
Let me out now!

1:25:07.673 --> 1:25:08.573
Let me out!

1:25:09.477 --> 1:25:14.513
Don't take me back!

1:26:02.629 --> 1:26:06.730
- Can I get you anything?
A drink, a bite to eat?

1:26:06.765 --> 1:26:08.501
- I don't want
anything from you.

1:26:08.536 --> 1:26:09.568
- Last night you were happy

1:26:09.603 --> 1:26:10.932
to take what belonged to me.

1:26:12.672 --> 1:26:14.969
But what's done is done.

1:26:23.551 --> 1:26:26.420
You survived. I'm impressed.

1:26:31.823 --> 1:26:32.789
You earned it.

1:26:34.463 --> 1:26:36.023
- That's blood money.

1:26:36.058 --> 1:26:40.302
- I understand you're upset.
You lost friends today.

1:26:41.536 --> 1:26:44.702
- They're not lost.
They're dead.

1:26:46.508 --> 1:26:48.475
My brother is dead.

1:26:48.510 --> 1:26:50.279
- We both lost a brother.

1:26:56.881 --> 1:26:58.419
- You're just gonna let me walk?

1:26:58.454 --> 1:27:00.289
- You have my word.

1:27:00.324 --> 1:27:01.752
- I ain't leaving without Leon.

1:27:01.787 --> 1:27:04.051
- Well, then you won't
leave at all.

1:27:04.086 --> 1:27:05.921
- People are gonna
find out about this.

1:27:05.956 --> 1:27:06.922
- About what?

1:27:09.025 --> 1:27:11.993
- You could go to the police
and tell them your story.

1:27:13.535 --> 1:27:14.864
But who will they believe?

1:27:16.934 --> 1:27:18.802
- You think you can
cover this up?

1:27:19.871 --> 1:27:21.409
- How adorable.

1:27:22.643 --> 1:27:25.743
You don't think this hunt
was our first, do you?

1:27:25.778 --> 1:27:28.449
And it certainly
won't be our last.

1:27:42.432 --> 1:27:45.763
No one said losing was easy.

1:27:46.799 --> 1:27:50.636
But it's dealing with the
loss that makes the man.
