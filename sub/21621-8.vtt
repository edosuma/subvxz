WEBVTT

00:05.439 --> 00:07.441
Shaq Diesel. Thanks, dude.

00:07.508 --> 00:10.777
I'm so stoked that you're
showing me around the ATL, man.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.080
-I'm hyped, I'm pumped.
-What is this?

00:14.081 --> 00:17.184
-This is it.
-We're gonna need a bigger car.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.786
I know what you're thinking, you're
thinking what everybody else says.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.555
You open it, it's got room,
you'll be fine.

00:21.622 --> 00:22.422
Let's go for it.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.093
-This ain't gonna work, John.
-No, no, I think...

00:26.159 --> 00:30.163
Just... No, I think you can do it.
Just bend a little bit.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.465
Thighs first, that's the key.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.801
No, ahh, no. Oh, s***!

00:35.769 --> 00:37.437
This ain't gonna work.
We need a bigger car.

00:37.504 --> 00:41.508
-No, we can make it work.
-Let me try it a little more. Uggh!

00:45.546 --> 00:47.347
-We need a bigger car.
-Let's get out.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.512
That's my jam.

01:51.578 --> 01:52.613
Gotta go like this, John.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.952
-This is nice.
-This is nice.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.689
So, this is our first time hanging out.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.259
Not just like a pleasantry,
like hey, how are you, sir.

02:05.325 --> 02:06.627
And a good day to you.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.662
Know what's crazy about us,
we got so much in common.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.265
Uh, like...?

02:11.331 --> 02:12.566
Movies.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.600
Check.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.068
Great athletes.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.172
-Check.
-And we both can freestyle.

02:18.238 --> 02:20.440
You still can go? Still got bars.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.776
-Every now and then.
-Bust 'em in the eye, Shaq

03:15.429 --> 03:16.964
And we out.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.632
Let it go out.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.070
This is the best right here.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.906
Wait for it.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.276
Psych!

03:30.911 --> 03:35.082
It's a three-pack. You still got it, man.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.284
-Still got it. Right on.
-Thank you.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.119
I haven't freestyled legit in years.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.387
Me either.

03:40.454 --> 03:43.223
-Want me to give you a beat?
-OK, just...

03:44.892 --> 03:46.460
All right.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.829
This is John Cena I'm about to lead off

03:48.896 --> 03:51.365
My rhymes so hot
It gets you rip the seat off

03:51.431 --> 03:53.233
Ah, there's no comparin' me, right?

03:53.300 --> 03:56.203
It's like Mike with his eyes closed
At the Charity Stripe

03:56.270 --> 03:58.472
Yeah, that's right My style is mean

03:58.539 --> 04:01.041
I go off the handle like the POTUS
On the Twitter machine

04:01.108 --> 04:03.877
Uh, yo, my style don't give two s****

04:03.944 --> 04:06.180
I've been bustin' rhymes
Since Shaq was in blue chips

04:06.246 --> 04:07.548
Waah!

04:08.615 --> 04:09.650
That was hot.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.286
Oh.

04:12.352 --> 04:13.887
Oh!

04:15.956 --> 04:18.358
Usually, it's just a bunch
of talking in the camera.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.627
And then I do this.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.930
-I got the horns.
-Gotta like the band.

04:27.734 --> 04:28.769
That's right.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.330
Dude, you have 10,000 nicknames.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.598
Black Hercules.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.168
You've also been called
"The Big Aristotle."

05:34.234 --> 05:35.269
Big Aristotle.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.237
"Extra Tallems" is one of your nicknames.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.873
'Cause I'm not tall,
I'm like extra tallems.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.410
I got nicknames for you, too,
and we'll go back and forth.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.945
All right, deal.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.613
I gave you "The Big Aristotle,"

05:46.680 --> 05:48.649
but I'll even follow with
"The Empire Strikes Shaq."

05:48.715 --> 05:50.117
Oh, that was a good one.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.219
-Can you sing?
-I can't.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.087
I can tell... Cena Turner.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.224
When you give people piggyback rides,

05:57.291 --> 06:00.027
are they piggyShaq rides? Yeah.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.596
You know I do a little
law enforcement work, right?

06:02.663 --> 06:04.398
I do, you're an officer in Miami.

06:04.464 --> 06:07.201
Yes, so you've just been served
with a sub Cena.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.338
You got a place here and in Orlando.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.673
Yes.

06:12.739 --> 06:15.309
Are you in a community with a cul-de-Shaq?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.945
-Ohh!
-Oh.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.515
Had me laughing so hard,
I almost had an asthma Shaq.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.117
-Oh, yeah! Yeah!
-That was a good one.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.953
How does it feel to be a sex symbol?

06:26.053 --> 06:29.223
I guess I'm just a Shaq of all trades.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.193
You win. You win.

06:38.465 --> 06:41.268
How did you take the Hack-a-Shaq nickname?

06:41.702 --> 06:42.870
Hated it.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.874
The general perception was that
you "weren't really that good"

06:46.940 --> 06:48.809
at the free-throw line.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.711
Fifty percent.
That's "make one and miss one."

06:50.777 --> 06:52.546
My motto is, I hit 'em
when I need to hit 'em.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.249
This is what I want to know
because you got guys

06:55.315 --> 06:57.551
who are like armchair quarterbacks at home

06:57.885 --> 07:00.020
going like, "Man, I could shoot better
than Shaq

07:00.087 --> 07:02.322
from the foul line," and I was like,

07:02.723 --> 07:05.025
"Yo, I can probably shoot better than Shaq

07:05.058 --> 07:07.461
from the foul line," so, uh...

07:07.528 --> 07:09.763
I kind of wanna put it to the test.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.832
Of course. You're John Cena,
Do whatever you like.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.568
Dude, I am so in.
Take us to a court, let's do it.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.874
We putting anything on this?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.176
What do we do?

07:22.242 --> 07:23.944
Loser has to do something humiliating.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.946
Something humiliating.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.883
-Ahh!
-OK.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.518
First one to five?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.387
Yeah, one at a time. First one to five.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.454
All right, ready.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.456
Oh!

07:38.392 --> 07:39.459
No, I'm ready now.

07:43.397 --> 07:45.532
-This man throw gone.
-The rotation was good.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.435
-It was really good, John.
-The ball flight, though, Shaq.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.970
-It was really good.
-Yeah.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.306
-Break.
- No talkin', man.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.575
People talkin' in the park
while I'm shootin'.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.610
See you.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.380
No, I'm just warming up.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.815
We're trying to shoot a perspective.

08:01.882 --> 08:05.118
They told me to miss a few.
Let it loose with the breeze.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.687
There you go.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.689
OK, all right, I got it.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.425
Yeah.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.228
Whoa!

08:15.028 --> 08:16.563
Stop talkin' while I'm shootin', man!

08:16.630 --> 08:18.365
No, keep it up, I like it.

08:18.432 --> 08:19.766
See ya.

08:25.439 --> 08:28.175
Oh, it's heatin' up! It's heatin' up!

08:28.242 --> 08:30.611
Ohh! Ohh!

08:31.712 --> 08:34.214
-All right.
-Four-four.

08:36.517 --> 08:37.484
Come on, go in.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.491
Shaq, score.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.629
I ain't missin' no more, John.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.335
I could shoot better than Shaq
from the foul line.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.871
I could shoot better than Shaq

08:57.938 --> 08:59.473
from the foul line.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.787
All right, OK.

09:13.854 --> 09:14.855
All right.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.625
All right, OK, all right.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.129
Yeah!

09:22.196 --> 09:24.331
-Our wager.
-See those two over there?

09:24.398 --> 09:25.832
Yeah.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.502
-Fudge, OK. Let's do this.
-You said it.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.271
-Yeah, that's fine.
-Let me do the talking.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.040
Short hair or long hair?

09:33.106 --> 09:35.509
- I will let you handle--
- Short or long hair?

09:35.576 --> 09:38.145
- I'm just gonna do it
- Excuse me, ladies.

09:38.212 --> 09:40.948
I know it's a weird question,
but do you mind

09:41.048 --> 09:43.617
if John squats you a couple reps?

09:43.684 --> 09:45.085
All right.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.386
He won't drop you.

09:46.453 --> 09:47.487
Here we go.

09:47.554 --> 09:51.491
All right, so I lost and you hit five,

09:51.558 --> 09:53.427
so I'm gonna do five for Shaquille O'Neal.

09:53.493 --> 09:57.231
-Five reps.
-I'm Shaquille O'Neal's b****.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.300
I'm Shaquille O'Neal's b****.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.202
I'm Shaquille O'Neal's b****.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.371
-Three.
-I'm Shaquille O'Neal's b****.

10:04.438 --> 10:07.441
-Four.
-I'm Shaquille O'Neal's b****.

10:07.508 --> 10:10.277
-And five. Thank you.
-All rightie.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.880
-That was good.
- It was awesome for me.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.181
Good times, bro.

10:14.248 --> 10:16.316
You're not a b****, you're John Cena.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.318
-Thank you, appreciate it.
-Don't ever say that again.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.523
Myth busted. Shaq shoots better
than anyone.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.424
Had to knock you out, John.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.993
You know why?

10:26.093 --> 10:28.462
Every time I play,
mama said, "Knock 'em out."

10:28.529 --> 10:30.230
Are you pointing me
in a certain direction?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.598
Are you leading me somewhere?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.242
Hit me, John, right now in the face.

10:43.177 --> 10:47.314
Aaah! One more time. Ohhh! I like it.

10:47.381 --> 10:48.515
I like it.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.217
I just assaulted Shaquille O'Neal.

10:50.284 --> 10:52.386
-I like it.
-I don't feel good about it.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.421
But the song made me wanna do it.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.123
"My mama said knock me out."

10:56.123 --> 10:57.991
LL Cool J's mom is filled with aggression

10:58.125 --> 10:59.893
and probably needs to talk
to somebody about that.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.973
So, John, is there any type of music

11:46.106 --> 11:49.009
that you're embarrassed to listen to
in front of people?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.111
No.

11:51.111 --> 11:54.882
You know what I love, John,
but I don't let my people know,

11:54.948 --> 11:56.583
but you know what I like?

11:56.650 --> 11:59.319
-They'll never find this out.
-They'll never find this out.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.054
-But you know what I like?
-Yeah, what?

12:01.054 --> 12:03.624
Eighties WGC.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.159
Eighties WGC.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.594
White guy classics.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.865
-White guy classics?
-White guy classics.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.066
Uh, like...

12:13.133 --> 12:14.368
Like...

12:24.678 --> 12:26.914
Is that a white guy classic?

12:30.384 --> 12:32.486
Don't you remember... Gotta do that tongo

12:32.553 --> 12:34.821
Do that tanto beat

12:34.888 --> 12:37.357
Duh-duh-duh

12:42.829 --> 12:45.799
Papa don't preach
And I know you, zee zee zee

12:45.866 --> 12:48.202
Got 'em. They 're starting
to come to me now.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.170
-They are.
-They're starting to come to me.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.406
Is there any way that
we could make them stop

12:52.472 --> 12:53.607
for the good of everyone else?

13:04.318 --> 13:06.753
Like sound effects.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.856
They actually fit.

13:13.327 --> 13:15.062
You've got this part for a long time.

13:16.597 --> 13:17.631
Come on, John.

13:20.067 --> 13:24.137
Dude, I think this is
an incredibly legit sax solo.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.074
-We gotta do like this.
-He's just goin' for it.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.076
No, but you gotta...

13:29.142 --> 13:31.078
The white guy used to do this
in the eighties.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.546
There you go.

13:32.613 --> 13:35.682
Yeah, big smile. Big eyes, John.

13:35.749 --> 13:37.885
-It's in the eye, there you go.
-Bigger?

13:37.951 --> 13:40.187
-Yeah, like that.
-Bigger?

13:41.655 --> 13:43.323
-Am I white?
-No, no, no.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.959
-I don't know what to say.
-You gotta dip.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.096
Am I white?

13:49.129 --> 13:51.331
Yeah, you're good now. Here we go.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.869
So, you're not playing hoops anymore,

13:55.936 --> 13:58.772
but you're doing the NBA pregame.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.308
NBA pregame, own a piece
of the Sacramento Kings.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.076
Just regular stuff, on television,

14:03.143 --> 14:05.913
owning a basketball team.
What else you got going on?

14:06.046 --> 14:07.614
I'm in the snack industry.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.683
-OK.
-See that sign right there.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.952
-What does that say?
-It says "Krispy Kreme," Shaq.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.289
-Guess who owns that one?
-Dude, you own a Krispy Kreme?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.591
-Yes, I do.
-Oh, my...

14:17.658 --> 14:19.359
You wanna help me do something special?

14:19.426 --> 14:21.328
-I'm in, no problem.
-Thank you, I appreciate it.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.240
Would you like to try
our VIP service today?

14:33.307 --> 14:35.375

14:35.442 --> 14:37.344

-Oh, wow!

14:37.411 --> 14:39.079

14:39.780 --> 14:41.715
